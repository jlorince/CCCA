SO PLEASE WELCOME FORMER HEAD OF
THE FEC AND MY PERSONAL LAWYER,
TREVOR POTTER.
TREVOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
FIRST OF ALL, SARAH PALIN AND
SARA PAC CAN SHE USE HER PAC
MONEY TO DO WHAT SHE'S DOING?
BASICALLY TAKE A VACATION WITH
HER FAMILY?
>> SURE, SHE CAN BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT YET A FEDERAL CANDIDATE.
IF SHE WERE A FEDERAL CANDIDATE
THEY COULDN'T USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS
FOR PERSONAL USE LIKE FAMILY
VACATIONS.
>> Stephen: SHE'S GETTING THIS
MONEY BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK SHE
MIGHT BECOME A FEDERAL
CANDIDATE.
>> RIGHT, THAT'S THE JOY OF THE
PAC YOU ARE PARTWAY THERE BUT
NOT YET A FULL CANDIDATE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU HAVE TO BE
SORT OF A PAC TEASE.
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S GO AFTER THE QUESTIONS THE
FEC SENT TO US.
ARE THEY WATCHING RIGHT NOW?
>> THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED IN
YOUR PAC AT THIS MOMENT SO I
EXPECT SOMEBODY IS UP LATE AT
NIGHT WATCHING THIS.
>> Stephen: THEYv: WORK SO HARD
ALREADY AND SUCH GREAT GUYS.
YOU SHOULDN'T STAY UP THIS LATE.
YOU ARE NOT PAID ENOUGH.
I TELL YOU WHAT IF WE GET THE
ANSWERS WE WANT, THE I PROMISE
THE NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE OF MY
PAC IS TO GET RAISES FOR EVERY
MEMBER OF THE FEC.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
>> AS YOUR LAWYER I SHOULD WARN
YOU ATTEMPTED BRIBER COULD GET
YOU INTO TROUBLE.
>> Stephen: I NAUGHT ATTEMPTED
BRIBEE WAS ESSENTIALLY FREE
SPEECH NOW.
>> GOOD ANSWER.
>> Stephen: LET'S GO OVER THE
QUESTIONS.
>> FOR THAT I NEED MY GLASSES.
I'VE GROWN OLD IN THE SERVICE TO
MY COUNTRY AS WASHINGTON SAID.
>> Stephen: I'M THE ONE WITH
THE BEARD.
>> DOES THE COLBERT REPORT
NORMALLY CREATE VIDEOS?
IF SO DOES IT HAVE A HISTORY OF
MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO OUTSIDE
GROUPS TO RUN INDEPENDENTLY OF
THE SHOW.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE WE MAKE
VIDEOS WE'RE A TELEVISION SHOW.
>> THEY WANT TO KNOW IF YOU GIVE
THEM TO OTHER GROUPS LIKE THE
COLBERT SUPERPAC.
>> Stephen: YES, THE CHAIR
CHARITY I'M INTERESTED IN THESE
DAYS IS COLBERT SUPERPAC.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE.
THIS IS ANOTHER QUESTION TO
HAVE.
>> HOW DOES THE CURRENT VIACOM,
COMEDY CENTRAL REVIEW AND
APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE SHOW
WORK.
>> Stephen: THERE'S NO
APPROVAL.
I SAY WHAT I WANT.
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE ASKING.
>> Stephen: I CAN PROVE IT.
HOW CAN I PROVE THEY HAD NO
APPROVAL OVER WHAT I SAID.
HEAD OF VIACOM SUMNER REDSTONE
IS ZEEMON SPAWN WHO FEASTS ON
YOUNG -- CHILDREN.
THEY WOULD NOT APPROVE OF THAT.
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT?
LET'S TRY THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.
>> IF THE SHOW STOPPED COVERING
IT, WOULD THE PAC CONTINUE TO
EXIST AND BE ACTIVE?
>> Stephen: THAT'S KIND OF
PHILOSOPHICAL?
THAT'S LIKE ASKING WHAT IS THE
SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING WHILE
THE OTHER HAND TAKES CORPORATE
CONTRIBUTIONS.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW LONG BEFORE WE GET OUR
ANSWER BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS
TICKING?
>> THEY HAVE 60 DAYS SO END OF
JUNE, BEGINNING OF JULY.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE
PERFECT FOR MY BUS TOUR.
[LAUGHTER]
TREVOR POTTER, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
ATTORNEY TREVOR POTTER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
