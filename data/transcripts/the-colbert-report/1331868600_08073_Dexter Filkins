>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN CALLED
THE PREMIERE COMBAT JOURNALIST
OF HIS GENERATION.
HE'S ABOUT TO MEET THE PREMIERE
COMBAT AVOIDER OF ANY
GENERATION.
PLEASE WELCOME DEXTER FILKINS!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, DEXTER.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
YOU'RE A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING
JOURNALIST.
YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK
"THE FOREVER WAR."
AND NOW YOU WORK AT THE "NEW
YORKER," TRUE?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, WHEN YOU'RE
IN A WAR ZONE, WHAT WAS THE
LATEST ONE YOU WERE IN?
>> AH, PAKISTAN.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, YOU'RE IN
PAKISTAN, THINGS ARE GETTING
HAIRY,UN, MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING TO
STAY AWAY FROM THE BAD GUYS OUR
FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE.
DOES IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU-- THE
WORK TER"NEW YORKER" WHY DON'T I
DO MOVIE REVIEWS OR DRAW THE
CARTOONS ABOUT THE PSYCHIATRIST
DOGS.
>> I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen:  ASSAD IN SYRIA IS
CRUSH, THE RESISTANCE OF HIS
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  AND LAST MONTH,
TWO JOURNALISTS McCREE COLVIN
AND ANTHONY SHADID DIED COVERING
THAT WAR.
ANTHONY SHADID HAS A RECENT BOOK
CALLED "HOUSE OF STONE:  A
MEMOIR OF HOME, FAMILY, AND A
LOST MIDDLE EAST."
WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE AND YOU
COLVIN AND SHADID, WHY DO YOU GO
DO IT?
AS AMERICANS, ISN'T IT
SUSPICIOUS THAT YOU EVEN CARE
ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES?
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT IS IT THAT DRAWS YOU-- I
MEAN, THERE'S A WAR ON WOMEN
HERE.
WHY NOT COVER THAT?
>> YOU JUST SAID IT.
I MEAN, IF YOU TAKE SYRIA.
I MEAN, HERE'S A GOVERNMENT THAT
WAS NOT ELECTED.
AND THEY ARE-- THEY ARE-- THEY
ARE WAGING WAR AGAINST THEIR
POPULATION.
THEY ARE SHELLING CITIES.
THEY ARE-- THEY'VE KILLED AT
LEAST 7,000 PEOPLE SO FAR.
THEY'VE TORTURED PEOPLE.
THEY'VE ARRESTED PEOPLE.
AND WHAT THEY WANT MORE THAN
ANYTHING IS THEY WANT TO BE ABLE
TO OPERATE IN SECRET.
THEY DON'T WANT THE REST OF THE
WORLD TO KNOW.
AND SO WHEN PEOPLE LIKE ANTHONY
AND MARIE WERE DOING, THEY WERE
BOTH FRIENDS, IS THEY JUST
WANTED TO GET IN AND TALK TO
PEOPLE AND TALK TO REAL PEOPLE
AND FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
AND THEN GET OUT AND TELL THE
REST OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU FEEL LIKE
A SENSE OF MISSION?
IS THIS LIKE A VOCATION TO DO
THIS OR THIS IS JUST A JOB AND
YOUR JOB JUST HAPPENS TO BE MORE
DANGEROUS THAN MINE?
>> IT'S A JOB.
IT'S A JOB.
I DON'T HAVE-- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO POINT OF VIEW THAT I'M TRYING
TO PUT ACROSS.
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
>> NO!
I MEAN, I THINK, IN FACT, WHAT
YOU FIND-- OR WHAT I FIND--
WHENEVER I'VE GONE INTO ONE OF
THESE PLACES, WHETHER IT'S
PAKISTAN OR YEMEN, WHERE I WAS
LAST YEAR, OR AFGHANISTAN, WHERE
I'M GOING IN ABOUT A WEEK, WHAT
YOU FIND OUT IS EVERYTHING YOU
THOUGHT BEFORE YOU GOT THERE WAS
WRONG.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DID YOU
LEARN YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT
IT FROM OTHER JOURNALISTS WHO
HAD GONE IN?
>> YEAH, BUT YOU CAN-- YOU CAN--
YOU DEVELOP INEVITABLY-- ANYONE
WOULD-- PRECONCEPTIONS.
IT'S NOT THAT THE PRECONCEPTIONS
ARE WRONG.
WHAT YOU DISCOVER IS THINGS ARE
UNBELIEVABLY COMPLICATED, AND
THEY'RE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
THAN, SAY, WHEN YOU COME HOME
AND YOU TURN ON THE TV AND YOU
HEAR SOMEBODY-- SOME RETIRED
COLONEL SHOUTING FROM A TV
STUDIO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S
TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S NOT THE COUNTRY THAT I SAW.
AND SO--
>> Stephen:  THIS IS THE
THINGY DON'T UNDERSTAND, IS
SOMEONE STILL NEEDS TO MAKE THE
ARGUMENT TO ME WHY WE NEED OTHER
COUNTRIES.
(  LAUGHTER  )
>> WELL--
>> Stephen:  BECAUSE I HAVE
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT
EVERYTHING EAST OF CAPE COD.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT'S THE WORST PLACE YOU'VE
EVER BEEN TO?
>> PAKISTAN.
>> Stephen:  PAKISTAN?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  ARE YOU EVER-- DO
YOU EVER HOPE THAT A WAR WOULD
BREAK OUT IN, LIKE, FIJI?
( LAUGHTER )
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, I HAVE TO SAY, THE FIRST
WAR ZONE I EVER WENT TO WAS
SRI LANKATHIS, ISLAND IN THE
INDIAN OCEAN.
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO FIJI, BUT
SIS RI LANKA IS EXTRAORDINARY.
I COVERED THIS KIND OF SCENE OF
A MASSACRE, AND I WENT BACK TO
MY HOTEL, WHICH WAS RIGHT ON
THIS BEAUTIFUL BEACH IN THIS
GORGEOUS HARBOR, AND I HAD
LOBSTER THAT NIGHT FOR DINNER.
SO IT-- THAT HAPPENS A LOT.
SOME OF THESE PLACES ARE
ACTUALLY PRETTY GORGEOUS.
YEMEN IS STUNNING.
IT'S AMAZING.
BUT IT'S--
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
>> BUT IT'S LIKE THE END OF THE
WORLD, TOO, YOU KNOW.
(  LAUGHTER  )
>> Stephen:  YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE BEEN DOING COVERAGE OF THE
ENTIRE WORLD FROM INSIDE A
STUDIO FOR YEARS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND IF I CAN RECOMMEND
SOMETHING, I HAVE A GREEN SCREEN
OVER THERE, YOU JUST STAND IN
FRONT OF IT, WE PUT A PICTURE
BEHIND YOU, AND EVERYONE
BELIEVES THAT YOU'RE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
AND ONE-- ONE KIND OF, LIKE,
BURNED OUT SANDY PHOTO BEHIND
YOU COVERS EVERYTHING FROM
MOROCCO TO PAKISTAN.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  IT'S A PENNY
PINCER.
>> WELL, KIND OF-- TRUE.
AND I-- I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU, AND A I
THINK A LOT OF THEM,
UNFORTUNATELY, CONTROL THE
BUDGETS OF A LOT OF NEWSROOMS.
WHAT YOU FIEND WHEN YOU-- YOU
KNOW, IT'S EASY FROM AFAR TO
LOOK AND SAY, YOU KNOW, THE
MUSLIM WORLD, MOROCCO ALL THE
WAY TO END'd INDONESIA AND SAY
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT IS EXTREMELY EASY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
ENJOYABLE.
DEXTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
DEXTER FILKINS.
HIS BOOK IS "THE FOREVER WAR."
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE POINT
OUT AGAIN "HOUSE OF STONE" BY
ANTHONY SHADID.
GO GET IT.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE
