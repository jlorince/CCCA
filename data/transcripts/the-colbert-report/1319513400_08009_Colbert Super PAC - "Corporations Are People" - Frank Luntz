CAN'T TAKE WITH IT.
YOU WAITED SO LONG THAT I
NOW KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO
MANIPULATE ME.
>> I WAS TRYING TO GATHER MY
THOUGHTS.
>> BUT IT TOOK TOO LONG.
YOUR THOUGHTS SHOULD BE
RIGHT THERE.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE SOMETHING IN 30
SECONDS.
I'M NOT ASKING FOR THE GETTY
GETTISBURG ADDRESS.
>> LET'S START AGAIN.
>> FRANK, I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE
YOU TO TRY IS TO TURN YOUR
DIAL UP TO 80, TRY IT FOR 1
SECOND AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
TURN IT UP.
>> NO, YOU HAD ME UP TO 60
AND THEN YOU TELL ME TO DO
SOMETHING.
>> OKAY, I GOT IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME TODAY.
I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE
AMERICA A BETTER PLACE.
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE THE ONES WHO WILL FIX
OUR PROBLEMS.
NOT THE POLITICIANS IN
WASHINGTON.
I WANT TO KNOW IF THE HOPES
YOU HAVE FOR YOUR CHILDREN,
THE HOPES YOU HAVE FOR YOUR
OWN FUTURE, 80.
>> 84, I WON.
>> YOU WON NOTHING.
>> YOU DON'T STOP AT 38 OR
84, YOU GO FOR 100, YOU GO
FOR PERFECTION.
>> LET'S DO FOCUS GROUPING,
LET'S GET THIS THING ON.
LET'S FIRE UP THE PROPAGANDA
MACHINE.
>> I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU ARE
NOT A PROPAGANDA MACHINE.
ARE YOU?
>> NO.
