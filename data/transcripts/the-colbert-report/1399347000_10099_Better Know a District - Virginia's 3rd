(LAUGHTER)NOW HEY, FOLKS, I WILL BE
WITH YOU IN JUST A MOMENT.
I JUST NEED TO PUT THEFINISHING TOUCHES ON THIS
"LITTLE MERMAID" I HAVE BEENWORKING ON HERE.
OH, PRETTY HAIR.
PRETTY HAIR.

THE 130 MERMAID STATUESALREADY ON DISPLAY IN THE
CITY.
AND COINCIDENTALLY NORFOLKCAN BE FOUND IN THE 77th
INSTALLMENT OF MY 434 PARTSERIES BETTER KNOW A
DISTRICT.
TONIGHT VIRGINIA'S THIRD,THE FIGHTIN THIRD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THE THIRD DISTRICT ABUTS
JAMESTOWN, AMERICA'S FIRSTPERMANENT ENGLISH SETTLEMENT
WHERE COLONIST JOHN SMITHWAS CAPTURED BY THE POWHATAN
INDIANS AND HAD HIS LIFESAVED BY POCAHANTAS AND
SAVED AGAINCENTURIES LATER BY
POCAHANTAS ON ICE. THE 3RD ISALSO WHERE
PATRICK HENRYUTTERED "GIVE ME LIBERTY OR
GIVE ME DEATH" WHILE THOMASJEFFERSON BRAVELY STOOD AT
HIS SIDE AND SAID "I DON'T KNOWTHAT GUY."
DURING THE CIVIL WARRICHMOND, VIRGINIA, WAS THE
CAPITOL OF THE CONFEDERACY.
TODAY THAT TITLE BELONGS TOCLIVEN BUNDY'S RANCH.
THE THIRD ALSO HOUSES THENORFOLK NAVAL STATION,
AMERICA'S LARGEST NAVALBASE.

LARGEST NAVAL BASE.

CHESAPEAKE BAY, SOMETIMESTHE BAY'S POLLUTION CAUSES
OXYGEN SEEKING CRABS TO MASSAT THE SHORELINE IN WHAT IS

TURNING ON THE TAP ANDDEPENDING ON SOME GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL WHO DOESN'T EVENHAVE A REAL JOB DETERMINE
WHETHER THAT WATER IS CLEAN ORNOT.
AND HE'S TASTED ITBEFORE I DO.

AND A LOT OF THE GUTREACTIONS ACTUALLY INCREASE
CRIME.
A LOT OF THINGS SOUND GOOD,SOUND LIKE THEY ARE TOUGH ON
CRIME.
>> Stephen: THREE STRIKES,YOU'RE OUT.
>> THAT DOES NOTHING TO REDUCECRIME.
>> Stephen: IT INCREASESPRISON TERMS.
IT INCREASES PRISON TERMS.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THEREFORE ITREDUCES CRIME BECAUSE THE
CRIMINALS ARE WHERE, IN JAIL?

UNLESS IT RHYMES OR ITSOUNDS TOUGH

>> THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITHRHYMES IS THAT IT CREATES AN
ILLUSION THAT ARE YOU DOINGSOMETHING ABOUT CRIME WHEN

HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAILTHAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ON

DIME, SEE I'M TRYING TO HELPYOU.
YOU HAVE GOT TO HELP ME OUT.
