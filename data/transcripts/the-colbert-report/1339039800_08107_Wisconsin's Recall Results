SPACE.
(LAUGHTER) THAT IS RAINING GOLD!
I'M TUNING IN.
OF COURSE, THE BIGGEST EVENT IN THE UNIVERSE HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN WISCONSIN.
POSSIBLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOMENT FOR THAT STATE SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF ELASTIC JEANS.
(LAUGHTER) YES, ALL EYES LAST NIGHT ALL EYES WERE ON AMERICA'S DAIRYLAND, THE BADGER STATE.
WARNING.
>> DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MILK A BADGER.
(LAUGHTER) TRUST ME.
NOW, AS YOU KNOW, WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND ONLY BOY IN HOME ROOM NOT TO RECEIVE A VALENTINE
SCOTT WALKER.
(LAUGHTER) FACED A RECALL AGAINST MILWAUKEE MAYOR I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME.
THE RECALL WAS SPARKED BY LAST YEAR'S MASSIVE PROTESTS OVER WALKER ELIMINATING COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING FOR TEACHERS UNIONS.
WELL, THE RESULTS ARE IN AND WALKER CRUSHED WHAT'S HIS FACE BY SEVEN POINTS!
SUCK IT, PEOPLE WHO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN!
(LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, THIS WISCONSIN ELECTION WASN'T ABOUT SOMETHING
AS TRIVIAL AS JUST WISCONSIN.
JIM?
>> ALL EYES ARE ON THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN.
THE RECALL RACE EXPECTED TO SET A NATIONAL TREND IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR.
>> IT'S THE SECOND-MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION THIS YEAR AND IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
>> THE WISCONSIN GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON EVERY RACE IN
AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.
>> IT'S A PRECURSOR ELECTION.
1979 MAGGIE THATCHER SWEPT INTO POWER IN ENGLAND, TOOK ON THE UNIONS AND WHAT FOLLOWED?
RONALD REAGAN.
I THINK THIS IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS BUT I THINK FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW WE'LL SEE AS REAGAN FOLLOWED
THATCHER MITT ROMNEY WILL FOLLOW SCOTT WALKER.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY!
WISCONSIN IS ENGLAND, SCOTT WALKER IS MARGARET THATCHER.
(LAUGHTER) THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE THE BRITISH MINING UNION WHICH IS MAKES BARACK OBAMA ILI ELLIOT!
OH NO!
NO!
NO!
DAMN IT STKPWR-FRPBLTS DAMN IT!
HE'LL CAPTURE OUR HEARTS WITH HIS GRACEFUL YES, SIR MASCULINE DANCING.
(LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS, THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL IT ATTRACTED CABLE NEWS
HREB TRITTTYS LIKE NEIL CAVUTO,
ED SCHULTZ AND BRETT BEAR WHO COULD PASS THE "YOUR NECK MUST BE THIS THICK TO ENTER
WISCONSIN" SIGN.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, EVERYBODY WHO WAS ANYBODY WAS ALL IN ON THIS BADGER STATE ELECTION-- EXCEPT ONE.
>> WHERE IS PRESIDENT OBAMA?
PRESIDENT OBAMA ISN'T STOPPING  WISCONSIN THIS WEEK.STOPPINGIN
>> YES, WISCONSIN DID NOT GET A VISIT FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THIS IS THE MOST INSULTING THING TO HAPPEN TO THE STATE SINCE SOMEONE DECLARES THIS
MILWAUKEE'S BEST.
(LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS I'M NOT SURPRISED.
SEE, OBAMA KNEW THE WRITING WAS ALREADY ON THE WALL-- AND NOT JUST FOR HIM.
>> I THINK THIS IS A REPUDIATION OF BIG UNIONS, NUMBER ONE, BIG LABOR.
THE UNIONS KNEW THEY WERE LOSING AFTER 2010, THEY'VE THROWN
EVERYTHING INTO THIS AND THEY'RE LOSING.
>> THIS SHOWS THE IRRELEVANCE OF UNIONS.
AT THIS POINT... I'VE SAID THEY'RE OBSOLETE.
>> Stephen: WHOO!
WE DID IT!
IT IS THE END OF UNIONS!
WHOO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOO!
JIMMY, JIMMY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, WHERE'S MY BALLOON TOSS?
>> STEPHEN, A LOT OF UNION PEOPLE WORK ON THIS SHOW AND THEY'RE KIND OF UPSET.
>> Stephen: IS THAT TRUE?
(LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.
I GUESS THAT.
BUT YOU LOST, OKAY?
SO LET'S BE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT IT.
IT'S MY SHOW.
DROP SOMETHING.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MESSAGED RECEIVED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
