FORMER CHANCELLOR OF THE D.C.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
SO MY SECURITY TEAM'S METAL
DETECTORS AND PATDOWNS WILL BE
FAMILIAR TO HER.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHELLE RHEE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MS. RHEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
NOW, YOUNG LADY, YOU'VE GOT
QUITE A STORIED HISTORY WHEN IT
COMES TO REFORMING EDUCATION.
YOU WERE, LET'S SEE, THIS IS A
PHOTO.
CAN I GET A SHOT OF THAT MAYBE
HERE ON TWO?
THAT'S YOU ON THE COVER OF
"TIME" MAGAZINE ABOUT TWO YEARS
AGO.
>> YEAH.
>> THIS TIME IT SAYS HOW TO FIX
AMERICA'S SCHOOLS.
OKAY.
YOU WERE THE KING OF REFORM
SCHOOL MOUNTAIN, AND NOW YOU
JUST LOST YOUR JOB AS THE HEAD
OF THE D.C. SCHOOLS.
>> I DID.
>> WHAT GIVES?
WHO DID YOU CROSS?
>> WELL, MY BOSS, ADRIAN FENTY,
WHO WAS THE MAYOR OF D.C., LOST
HIS ELECTION, SO THAT MEANS I
LOST MY JOB.
>> YOU LOST YOUR JOB AND NOW THE
KIDS GET LEFT BEHIND.
>> WELL, NO, HOPEFULLY THEY
DON'T.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU FAN OF ONO
CHILD LEFT BEHIND?
>> I ACTUALLY AM.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
SAYING GEORGE BUSH IS OUR
GREATEST PRESIDENT.
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS
THING.
>> IT WAS HIS THING.
I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE CREDIT
WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.
THIS IS ONE AREA THAT PRESIDENT
BUSH ACTUALLY DID A VERY GOOD
JOB IN BECAUSE HE BROUGHT
ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS.
>> Stephen: NOW, AS AN
EDUCATOR OR AS SOMEONE REFORMING
EDUCATION, WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST
CHALLENGE YOU FACED?
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
WAS CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE
SCHOOL DISTRICT.
I THINK THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT
USED TO BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT OUR JOBS WERE, WHICH
WAS EDUCATION.
>> Stephen: YOU TALKING
TEACHERS UNIONS?
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
TEACHERS UNIONS.
>> Stephen: WE HAD A STRIKE
AROUND HERE.
I SENT OUT HOOLIGANS AND I BEAT
MY WRITERS UNTIL THEY CAME BACK
HERE AND STARTED THE
TIPPITY-TAPPITY AGAIN.
WHY DON'T YOU CRACK A FEW
SKULLS?
>> WELL, WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD
USE A CARROT INSTEAD OF A STICK,
SO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS
ACTUALLY SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE
WE COULD PAY THE BEST TEACHERS
SIX-FIGURE SALARIES AND PAY THEM
WHAT THEY DESERVE BUT ALSO
ENSURE THAT THEY WERE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING A GOOD JOB
SO IF THEY WERE INEFACTTIVE WE
COULD QUICKLY REMOVE THEM FROM
THEIR DUTIES.
>> Stephen: LET ME TAKE YOU TO
TASK FOR A SECOND.
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ON
EDUCATION.
SELL ME ON EDUCATING CHILDREN.
WHY?
RIGHT?
BECAUSE WHY SHOULD I CARE, AN
LET ME PUT THIS DELICATELY, WHY
SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THE KIDS AT
GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER HIGH
SCHOOL WHEN MY KIDS ARE DOING
FINE AT ED BEGLEY, JR., PREP?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, A LOT OF
PEOPLE THINK THEIR KIDS ARE
DOING WELL AT ED BEGLEY, JR.,
PREP.
>> Stephen: MY KIDS ARE THE
SMART KIDS.
MY CHILDREN ARE THE MOST
BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT
CHILDREN IN THE WORLD.
>> YOU MAY THINK, SO BUT WHAT
THE DATA SAYS IF YOU LOOK AT THE
TOP 5% OF AMERICAN STUDENTS,
THEY ARE ACTUALLY 25th OUT
OF 30 DEVELOPED NATIONS IN TERMS
OF THE GLOBAL TOP...
>> Stephen: BUT IF I REFUSE TO
LEARN MATH, I WON'T KNOW THAT.
>> BUT THEN YOU WON'T HAVE A JOB
EITHER.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT US TO BE
NUMBER ONE AGAIN?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHEN WERE WE
NUMBER ONE?
WERE WE EVER AHEAD OF GERMANY?
>> AMERICA WAS NUMBER ONE IN THE
1950s.
WE WERE NUMBER ONE IN GRADUATION
RATES.
WE WERE NUMBER ONE IN RATES OF
GOING TO COLLEGE AND OUR
PROFICIENCY RATES WERE A LOT
HIGHER THAN MOST DEVELOPED
NATIONS.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO OUR SCHOOLS THAT YOU ARE
TRYING TO REVERSE?
>> SO I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED
WAS WE HAVE A LOT OF SPECIAL
INTERESTS NOW WHO ARE DRIVING
THE AGENDA IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, TEXTBOOK
MANUFACTURERS, YOU HAVE TEACHERS
UNION, YOU HAVE FOOD SERVICE
PEOPLE, AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THERE IS NO ORGANIZED INTEREST
GROUP THAT REPRESENTS CHILDREN.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE
KIDS?
DID YOU ASK THE KIDS HOW THEY
THINK THE SCHOOLS SHOULD BE
CHANGED?
DID YOU TRY 7-UP IN THE WATER
FOUNTAIN OR DOUGHNUT DAY IN
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I
DID TALK TO THE KIDS ALL THE
TIME.
I ASKED THEM, IF I COULD DO ONE
THING THAT WOULD REALLY IMPROVE
YOUR EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL, WHAT
WOULD IT BE.
AND THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR SPRITE
IN THE WATER FOUNTAIN, THEY
ASKED FOR GREAT TEACHERS.
THEY SAID, IF YOU BRING US GREAT
TEACHERS, THAT MAKES EVERYTHING
WORTHWHILE.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT YOU'RE NO
LONGER THE HEAD OF THE D.C.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WHAT IS NEXT FOR
YOU?
WHAT JOB WILL YOU BE FORCED OUT
OF NEXT?
LAFTD LAUGHTER
>> WELL, HOPEFULLY I WON'T BE
FORCED OUT OF ANY JOB, BUT I'M
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES
SENSE IN TERMS OF A NEXT JOB.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT OF BEING A
CORRESPONDENT.
>> WELL, I'D BE VERY INTERESTED
IN JOINING THE TEAM.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A
RESUME?
>> NEW YORK I DON'T.
>> Stephen: WELL, WE'LL NEED
TO SEE REFERENCES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MICHELLE RHEE, FORMER HEAD OF
THE D.C. P
