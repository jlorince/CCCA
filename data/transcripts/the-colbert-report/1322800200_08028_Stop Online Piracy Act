YOU BET.
FOLKS, AS A CONTENT PROVIDER,
I AM WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGAINST
THE INFRINGEMENT OF
COPYRIGHT.
SO MUCH SO THAT I HAD THAT
PHRASE TRADEMARKED AND THEN
HI IT EMBLAZONED ON A MICKEY
MOUSE-- YOU SEE,
COUNTERFEITING AND DIGITAL
PIRACY ARE HUGE PROBLEMS FOR
THOSE OF US IN THE MEDIA
BUSINESS.
THE FBI REPORTS THAT U.S.
BUSINESSES LOSE $200 TO $250
BILLION TO COUNTERFEIT ON AN
ANNUAL BASIS.
AND THAT IS A SHOCKING
NUMBER.
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER
THAT THE FBI ADMITS IT HAS
NO RECORD OF SOURCE DATA OR
METHODOLOGY FOR GENERATING
THE ESTIMATE AND THAT IT
ACCOUNT NO BE CORROBORATED.
NOW FOLKS, THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN THE FBI BUYS
BOOTLEG REPORTS OFF A CARD
TABLE IN CHINATOWN.
BUT FOLKS, THIS PIRACY IS
EVERYWHERE.
STUDIES SHOW THAT ALMOST
HALF OF ADULTS HAVE BOUGHT,
COPIED OR DOWNLOADED
BOOTLEGGED MUSIC OR VIDEO
INCLUDING 70% OF THOSE AGED
18 TO 29.
SADLY PIRACY IS JUST ONE OF
THOSE CRIMES EVERYBODY
COMMITS LIKE JAYWALKING OR
SETTING YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND'S
COUCH ON FIRE.
THANKFULLY, THANKFULLY
CONGRESS IS FINALLY TAKING
ACTION WITH THE STOP ON-LINE
PIRACY ACT.
THE BILL WHICH IS SUPPORTED
BY ALL THE BIG MEDIA
COMPANIES GRANTS RIGHTS
HOLDERS.
THE UNFETTERED POWER TO
EFFECTIVELY KILL WEB SITES
SO IF YOU POST UNLICENSED
COPY WRITTEN MATERIAL WHICH
IS A THEFT, ONSITES LIKE
YOUTUBE, FACEBOOK OR TWITTER,
THOSE ENTIRE SITES COULD BE
SHUT DOWN.
UNLESS THAT MATERIAL IS
REMOVED WITHIN FIVE DAYS.
AND THE ONE WHO POSTED THE
COPY WRITTEN MATERIAL COULD
FACE FIVE YEARS IN PRISON
FOR A FIRST OFFENSE.
AT LAST, WE WILL BRING SWIFT
AND SURE JUSTICE TO HARDENED
CRIMINALS ON YOUTUBE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S ENOUGH, JIMMY.
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO BE A
SINGLE LADY?
JAIL.
