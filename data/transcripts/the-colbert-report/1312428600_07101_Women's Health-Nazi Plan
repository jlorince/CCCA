>> WELCOME BACK.
WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I SAID IT MANY TIMES ON
THIS VERY BROADCAST.
I AM NO FAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.
I AM AN ORIGINALIST.
I SAY WE LIVE OUR LIVES THE WAY
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS INTENDED,
FOUR FEETFALL, CRIPPLED WITH
RICKETTS UNTIL WE DIE OF OLD AGE
AT 28.
BUT NOW THE DHS HAS HANDED DOWN
A BAFFLING NEW MANDATE.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL
SOON FORCE PRIVATE HEALTH
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY FOR
BREAST-FEEDING BABIES, BIRTH
CONTROL FOR WOMEN.
>> THE FOCUS IS PREVENTATIVE
CARE, SO FREE H.I.V. SCREENINGS,
FREE COUNSELING, EVEN FREE
BREAST PUMPS ARE COVERED UNDER
THE PLAN WHICH COULD START AS
SOON AS NEXT AUGUST.
>> Stephen: THIS IS AN
OUTRAGE.
A WOMAN'S HEALTH DECISIONS ARE A
PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN HER
PRIEST AND HER HUSBAND.
[APPLAUSE]
BESIDES, FOLKS, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN BIRTH CONTROL.
IF YOU WANT TO CONTROL YOUR
FERTILITY, DO IT THE WAY GOD
INTENDED, WITH A COLD, LOVELESS
MARRIAGE.
FIRM HANDSHAKE.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
TILL MORNING THEN.
[APPLAUSE]
SEE YOU AFTER WORK.
NOW, TO SOME THIS PLAN MAY SEEM
BENIGN, BUT IOWA REPUBLICAN
STEVE KING KNOWS THE THE ELLE
NAZIS ARE UP TO SOMETHING
SINISTER.
>> THEY'VE CALLED IT
"PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE."
WELL, IF YOU APPLY THAT
PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE
UNIVERSALLY, WHAT YOU END UP
WITH IS YOU'VE PREVENTED A
GENERATION.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
AMERICANS ONLY HAVE CHILDREN BY
ACCIDENT.
IT'S CLEARLY HARD TO IMAGINE
ANYONE HAVING STEVE KING ON
PURPOSE.
I MEAN, FREE BIRTH CONTROL...
[APPLAUSE]
FREE BIRTH CONTROL WILL WIPE OUT
THE AMERICAN RACE.
THAT'S WHAT WIPED OUT THE
DINOSAURS.
A BOWL OF FREE CONDOMS.
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE T-REX
GOT THEM ON.
[APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I'M ANGRY.
FOLKS, THIS PLAN IS NOT JUST THE
END OF HUMANITY.
IT IS THE END OF DECENCY.
AS EXPLAINED BY OUTRAGED BLONDE
FOX LADY.
>> WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU
ENCOURAGE YOUR DAUGHTERS AND
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS AND WHOEVER
ELSE COMES BEHIND YOU TO HAVE
UNRESTRICTED, UNLIMITED SEX ANY
TIME, ANYWHERE?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
WHY?
BECAUSE HICKORY SMOKED LADY AND
I KNOW THAT IF WE GIVE YOUR
DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS
ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL, THEY
WILL INSTANTLY TURN INTO WANTON
HARD LETS WITH AN INSATIABLE
SEXUAL APPETITE BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WOMEN ARE ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF
NYMPHOMANIACAL.
THEY'LL PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION
AND BONE THE PHARMACIST, THE
STOCK BOY AND EVERYBODY IN LINE
FOR THE BUS.
WHY?
BECAUSE THE BIRTH CONTROL IS
PAID FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE]
AND THE SPRAY TAN VICTIM IS JUST
BEGINNING TO MAKE HER POINT.
JIM?
>> NOW WE'RE GOING TO COVER
BIRTH CONTROL, BREAST PUMPS,
COUNSELING FOR ABUSE.
ARE WE GOING TO DO PEDICURES AND
MAN CURE, AS WELL?
>> Stephen: THANK YOU
FINALLY A WOMAN AGREES WITH ME
THAT THOSE ARE JUST FRIVOLOUS
IMPULSE BUYS.
YOU KNOW THE LADIES, THEY'RE
ALWAYS PUMPING OUT BREAST MILK,
GETTING A MANI PEDI, HAVING A
COSMO WITH THEIR ABUSE COUNSELOR
AND THEN PICK UP SOME SPERP
SIDE.
THIS IS WHY WE MUST REPEAL OBAMA
CARE AND GET BACK THE INSURANCE
COMPANIES COVERING ONLY REAL,
NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES LIKE
BONER BILLS.
HOW ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
SEXUALLY SATISFY THE ARMY OF
FLESH-THIRSTY YOUNG SLUTS OBAMA
IS CREATING WITH YOUR TAX
DOLLARS?
