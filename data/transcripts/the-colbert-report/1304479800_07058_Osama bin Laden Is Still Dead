>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT BEGUN EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU -- WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
SUCH A RESPONSE.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PLEASE, PLEASE, THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU THAT
KIND OF RESPONSE AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE SHOW JUST MAKES
ME WANT TO PUT ALL OF YOU ON MY
BUCKET LIST.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
AND SOME OF YOU DO.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NATION, I HAVE TO GET TO THE
NEWS.
I HAVE JUST BEEN HANDED THIS
EXCITING NEWS:  BIN LADEN IS
STILL DEAD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
THAT -- THAT IS THE NICE THING
ABOUT DEAD TERRORISTS THEY ONLY
GET DEADER.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE DON'T
SEEM TO APPRECIATE JUST HOW DEAD
HE IS.
THEY WOULD RATHER SOUND SMART
THAN DANCE ON BIN LADEN'S GRAVE.
>> CERTAINLY OSAMA BIN LADEN IN
RECENT YEARS WAS A SYMBOLIC
FIGUREHEAD OF AL QAEDA.
>> IN RECENT YEARS IT IS A FACT
THAT THE U.S. BELIEVED BIN LADEN
WAS BECOMING MORE OF A SYMBOLIC
FIGUREHEAD.
>> THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO
REGARDED HIM AS A FIGUREHEAD.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT IF WAS A
FIGUREHEAD.
SO IS THE BRITISH MONARCHY AND
WE LOVE THEM.
WHETHER OR NOT BIN LADEN HAD
DAY-TO-DAY CONTROL OF AL QAEDA
WE LOVED HIM FOR THE PAGEANTRY.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE WAS
WEARING.
I WANT TO PERSONALLY
CONGRATULATE THE GUYS WHO GOT
HER DONE, SEAL TEAM 6!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GIVE IT UP.
ABSOLUTELY.
OH, YEAH!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SEAL TEAM 6, OKAY, I DON'T WANT
TO JINX ANYTHING BUT I THINK
THIS MISSION HAS GOT TO PUSH
THEM UP TO THE TOP FIVE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW I WISH I COULD SHOW YOU A
PICTURE OF THESE ABBOTTABADASSES
BUT IT'S CLASSIFIED.
I'M GOING TO GUESS IT'S RAMBO,
MASTER CHIEF, THE BATMAN, VIN
DIESEL AND LET'S SAY CUNNING FU
PANDA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE OPERATION WENT OFF WITHOUT A
HITCH, FOLKS.
AS FORMER SEAL TEAM COMMANDER
TOLD FOX NEWS.
>> PICTURE PERFECT, THEY WERE
INVITED TO THE SUPER BOWL, THEY
WON THE GAME AND BECAUSE NOBODY
GOT HURT THEY GOT AN OSCAR FOR
THE FROSTING ON THE CAKE.
>> Stephen: YES, THE OSCAR WAS
THE FROSTING ON THE CAKE WHERE
THEY BLEW OUT THE CANDLES THAT
BROUGHT HOME OR THE STANLEY CUP
FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A
MUSICAL GOOOOAL!
FOLKS, THE SEALS DIDN'T JUST
GRAB OSAMA BIN LADEN THEY ALSO
SEIZED TEN HARD DRIVES, FIVE
COMPUTERS AND MORE THAN 100
STORAGE DEVICES INCLUDING DISKS,
DVDS AND THUMB DRIVES, YES THUMB
DRIVES.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
AFTER WE CAUGHT THE SHOE BOMBER
HEAD TO TAKE OFF OUR SHOES.
NOW THAT THEY'VE FOUND THE THUMB
DRIVES TRIPS TO THE AIRPORT
SECURITY LINES WILL SOUND LIKE
THIS.
>> THEY TOOK MY THUMB!
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THE POINT IS WE
HAVE BEEN -- BIN LADEN'S
COMPUTERS NOW WHICH MEANS WE
KNOW ALL THE SONGS ON HIS
IPOD.
I SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE HAD A
ZUNE.
YOU KNOW?
THAT LAST COMMENT CROSSED THE
LINE.
IT IS ONE THING TO SHOOT A MAN
IN THE EYE AND SOMETHING ELSE TO
ACCUSE HIM OF
