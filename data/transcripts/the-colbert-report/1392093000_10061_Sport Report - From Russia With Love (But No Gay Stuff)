THE ORGANIZATION FORSECURITY AND COOPERATION IN

AMBASSADOR?
>> WELL, WE WORK TO ADVANCEU.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN MY
CASE, AT THE IOC TO BRINGTHE VISION OF A EUROPE WHERE
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR HUMANRIGHTS RESPECTED TO REALITY.
>> SO YOU ARE ONE OF ONLYFIVE OPENLY GAY AMBASSADORS.
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW?
>> MY PARENTS DO KNOW.
>> AND HOW DID THEY TAKE ITWHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT YOU
WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT?
>> MY MOM HAS BEEN VERYSUPPORTIVE OF MY CAREER FOR
THE GOVERNMENT.
>> EVEN THOUGH BEING ANAMBASSADOR IS A CHOICE.
>> IT IS, YES.
>> SO AS AN AMBASSADOR AREYOU ABOVE THE LAW?

NO.
>> COULD YOU JUST LIKE HITSOMEONE WITH YOUR CAR AND
JUST WALK AWAY SCOT-FREE?

>> THEY DO FROM TIME TOTIME.
>> OH, OKAY, FINALLY SO,THERE ARE SOME PERKS.
>> THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOMEPERKS.
>> SO AS AN EXPERT, WHAT ISTHE RUSSIAN ANTI-GAY
LEGISLATION.
>> WELL, THE SO-CALLED GAYPROPAGANDA LAW BANS-- MAKES
IT ILLEGAL TO TALK ABOUTNONTRADITIONAL SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS IN A WAY THATWOULD EITHER MAKE THEM SEEM
GOOD OR EQUAL TO OTHERRELATIONSHIPS.
>> SO WHAT ABOUT IF YOUR GAYRELATIONSHIPS WEREN'T EQUAL
TO STRAIGHTRELATIONSHIPS?
>> WELL, I THINK THEQUESTION IS NOT A QUESTION
ABOUT ONE PARTICULARRELATIONSHIP OR ANOTHER
BUT -->> ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE
THE RIGHT TO HAVE TERRIBLERELATIONSHIPS.
>> YOU KNOW.
>> WE SHOULD ALL BE FREE TOBE TRAPPED IN LOVELESS
MARRIAGES.
>> HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT BUT ITHINK WHETHER YOU ARE GAY OR
STRAIGHT SHOULDN'T DETERMINEWHETHER YOU ARE.
>> SO THIS LAW MEANS THAT IFI WEAR LET'S SAY A RAINBOW
T-SHIRT, THAT COULD GET MEARRESTED?
>> WELL, I THINK IT COULDBECAUSE IT IS SUCH A VAGUE
LAW.
>> BUT SERIOUSLY, DAN, DON'TYOU THINK WEARING A RAINBOW
SHIRT SHOULD GET YOUARRESTED.
I MEAN WHY NOT JUST GO OUTDRESSED AS A UNICORN,
IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE ON ACOLOR WEAR BLACK OR NOTHING
AT ALL, OR JUST DON'T GOOUT.
>> WHAT PEOPLE WEAR IS ONEOF THE WAYS THAT THEY
EXPRESS THEMSELVES.
>> SO IN OTHER WORDS, NOTTOO MANY ZIPPERS.
HOW MANY ZIPPERS ON ANOUTFIT COULD ONE HAVE
WITHOUT APPEARING TOO GAY.
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANTNOT TO OVERTHINK THIS.
>> BUTTONS, ARE BUTTONSGAYER THAN ZIPPERS?
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER HADAN OPINION ON THAT.
>> I WAS TOLD THAT IN ORDERFOR ME TO BE SAFE I SHOULD
GO ALL VELCRO, JUST SO ITHAS THAT MACHO SOUND WHEN
YOU UNDO YOUR PANTS.
>> I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.
>> SO YOU BELIEVE THE PEOPLESHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WEAR
WHAT THEY WANT.
>> I DO.
>> OH.
THAT'S INTERESTING.
YOU'RE OUT ON A LIMB THERE,DAN.
>> HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT A VERYLONG ONE.
>> I HOPE IT'S A VERY THICKONE.
>> LET ME CLARIFY, WILL THEOLYMPICS BE SAFE FOR ME?
>> I COULD CARE LESS ABOUTTHE LATVIAN LUGE TEAM, I
MEAN THEY'RE LUGERS, RIGHT?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK AS WITHALL LARGE SPORTING EVENTS,
WE'RE ENCOURAGING EVERYBODYTO BE ATTENTIVE AND MAKE
GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT THEIRPERSONAL SAFETY.
>> I WOULDN'T WANT TO RUN AFOUL OF THESE LAWS.
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING SOMEBASIC PHRASES TO HELP ME OUT
OF TROUBLE.
CAN YOU POINT ME TO THENEAREST HARDWARE STORE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THATONE.
>> I THINK DEPENDING ON THECONTEXT, PEOPLE MIGHT BE
CONFUSED.
>> WOMEN, AM I RIGHT?
WHO NEEDS THEM, EXCEPT FORTHEIR VAGINAS?
>> IS THAT -->> I THINK THAT WOULD
PROBABLY GET YOU IN TROUBLEWITH A LOT OF PEOPLE.
>> VAGINAS, CAN I HAVE TWOOF THEM-- CAN I HAVE ONE IN
EACH COLOR.
>> HOW ABOUT THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THEBEST ADVICE IS TO JUST BE
YOURSELF.
>> OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAN, DO IHAVE OFFICIAL CLEARANCE TO
ENTER SOCHI?
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY, THEOFFICIAL CLEARANCE WILL COME
FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENTBECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET A
VISA.
>> THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OFWORK.

>> OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU,SIR.
I PROMISE THAT I WON'T LETAMERICA DOWN.

>> WELL, I LEARNED A LOT.
AND I'M SURE I'LL REMEMBERSOME OF IT.
