SOMETHING TO KEEP ME COMPANY
WHEN I'M ON THE THINKING CHAIR.
SO, FOR AS WHERE DETROIT GOES
FROM HERE.
WHO KNOWS?
THIS GUY DOES.
PLEASE WELCOME WILL EDITORIAL
PAGE EDITOR OF THE "DETROIT FREE
PRESS," STEPHEN HENDERSON.
MR. HENDERSON, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?
WHAT'S THAT?
>> BEFORE WE GET STARTED, YOU'VE
BEEN PRETTY HARD ON US IN
DETROIT.
>> Stephen: I'VE BEEN PRETTY
HONEST.
>> WE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET OUT
OF THIS.
SO I BROUGHT YOU TH T-SHIRT THAT
SUMS UP OUR ATTITUDE ABOUT THE
WHOLE WORLD.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I'LL
TAKE THAT.
>> MADE BY A DETROIT VENDOR,
AVAILABLE IN DETROIT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: I NOTICE THIS IS A
HOODIE.
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME KILLED?
>> WELL, I THINK-- I THINK IT
WILL BE GOOD IF YOU DON'T AWARE
IT IN FLORIDA.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS TO
DETROIT FROM HERE?
DO YOU GUYS FULL OUT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY
TEACH YOU WHEN YOU'RE BORN IN
DETROIT-- AS IEFS IS HOW TO TAKE
A PUNCH, GO DOWN, GET UP, BRUSH
YOURSELF OFF, AND SAY I'M STILL
HERE.
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.
THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
THEY TEACH JEW THAT'S ONE OF THE
FIRST THINGS.
IT'S A TOUGH PLACE.
>> Stephen: IS PUNCH BABIES IN
DETROIT OUT OF LOVE.
>> SHAMEFUL BUT TRUE GLEEL OKAY,
$18 BILLION, THAT'S HOW FAR
YOU'RE DOWN.
BILL GATES IS WORTH $72 BILLION.
HE COULD ENEMY IN THERE, WAVE A
MAGIC WAND, YOU HAVE GUYS
THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING MALARIA?
( LAUGHTER )
IT CAN'T BE THAT FAR OFF.
IT CAN'T BE THAT FAR OFF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE MAYOR
ABOUT THAT, BUT I WILL SUGGEST
IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK
WE'RE VERY DESERVING OF SOME
SORT OF HELP OF SOME KIND.
THIS IS--
>> Stephen: BUT WE ALREADY
BAILED OUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY.
HOW MUCH MORE BAILOUT DOES
DETROIT NEED?
>> THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY.
DETROIT WAS THE ARSENAL OF
DEMOCRACY IN THE 1940s DURING
WORLD WAR II.
WE WITH THE THE TANKS AND PLANES
THAT MAKE SHEER YOU DON'T SPEAK
WITH A GERMAN ACCENT.
>> Stephen: AND WE THANKED YOU
FOR THAT BY GIVING YOU MOTOWN.
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK-- I THINK
WE GAVE MOTOWN TO THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: WHATEVER.
>> BUT WHATEVER.
DETAILS, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
WHAT CAN DETROIT DO TO PULL
ITSELF UP BY ITS OWN BOOTSTRAPS
BEFORE WE GIVE IT A BAILOUT?
DOESN'T DETROIT HAVE TO MAKE AN
EFFORT?
WHAT ABOUT SELLING THE ART FROM
THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART?
THAT-- THAT WAS BOUGHT WHEN YOU
GIERPZ THE FOURTH LARGEST CITY.
YOU DON'T NEED THAT MUCH CULTURE
ANYMORE.
>> RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE
D.I.A. THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IT'S
LIKE A PARK OR LIKE ANOTHER
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTE OF THE CITY.
SELLING IT WOULD PREVENT THE
CITY FROM BEING THE GREAT PLACE
THAT IT COULD BE--
>> Stephen: YOU CAN KEEP THE
BUILDING.
JUST SELL OFF WHAT'S INSIDE OF
IT, YOU KNOW.
>> I SHOULD ADMIT THAT MY WIFE
IS THE MARKETING DIRECTORT
MUSEUM.
>> Stephen: ANOTHER DOES SHE
HAVE AN INSIDE SCOOP--
>> IF YOU REALLY ARE INTERESTED
IN ART, I PROBABLY COULD GET
YOU--
>> Stephen: YOU PUT THIS DOWN
ON A PICASSO.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE A LADY, SOMETHING WITH AN
EVEN NUMBER OF BREASTS, PLEASE.
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT TURNING
IN ALL OF DETROIT INTO SORT OF A
WILLIAMSBURG, BECAUSE
MANUFACTURING SEEMS TO BE
LEAVING THE UNITED STATES.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW,
WILLIAMSBURG HOLDS ON TO A
LITTLE TIME CAPSULE OF AN
AGRARIAN SOCIETY.
WHAT IF DETROIT BECAME A TIME
CAPSULE OF AN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
AND PEOPLE COULD COME THERE AND
SAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE US
WELD A BUICK?
>> THAT'S ONLY IF YOU BELIEVE
THAT MANUFACTURING IS ONLY PART
OF OUR PAST.
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE-- AND MOST
PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT'S
PART OF OUR FUTURE, TOO.
THE AUTO COMPANIES AFTER THEIR
BAILOUT ARE BACK TO 15.5 MILLION
UNITS A YEAR SELLING.
WE ARE REBUILDING MANUFACTURING
IN DETROIT.
WHAT WE NEED IS CONSISTENT
POLICY FROM WASHINGTON,
CONSISTENT POLICY FROM OUR STATE
CAPITAL IN LANSING.
WE NEED PEOPLE TO SUPPORT US
INSTEAD OF TURNING THEIR BACK ON
US.
>> Stephen: YOU LIVE IN
DETROIT AND ALSO WORK IN THE
NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY.
ARE YOU A GLUTTON FOR
PUNISHMENT?
( LAUGHTER )
>> YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.
I CAME BACK TO DETROIT FROM
WASHINGTON SIX YEARS AGO.
AND PEOPLE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I
WAS INSANE.
BUT IT'S MY HOME.
>> Stephen: AND MAYBE YOU
WANTED TO LIVE SOMEPLACE LESS
CORRUPT.
>> A LITTLE LESS CORRUPT.
IT'S MY HOME.
IT'S A PLACE THAT PRODUCED ME.
IT PRODUCE AID LOT OF PEOPLE I
KNOW MAKING GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS
IN THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRY.
I WANTED TO RAISE MY KIDS THERE
AND I'LL STICK BY THAT.
>> Stephen: WELL, GOOD LUCK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
UNTIL THIS THING BLOWS OVER, WHY
DON'T YOU CALL CHICAGO AND ASK
IF ALL OF DETROIT CAN CRASH ON
THEIR COUCH.
>> WELL, WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO
THAT.
>> Stephen: STEPHEN HENDERSON
FROM THE "DETROIT FREE PRESS."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
