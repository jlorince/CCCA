>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, I DON'T LIKE TO TALKABOUT THIS.
THE TRUTH IS, I'VE GOT A LITTLEBIT OF A PROBLEM WITH BUGS.
NOT JUST IN THE BACKYARD SHEDWHERE I STORE MY COLLECTION OF
DECORATIVELY SHATTERED OREOS.
FOR YEARS, SCIENTISTS HAVE TOLDUS UP TO 75% INSECTS MAY BE
INVOLVED IN SAME-SEX SEXUALINCIDENTS.
ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, THOSEBILLIONS OF INSECTS ARE HAVING
GAY SEX ACCIDENTALLY.
THAT'S A RELIEF.
IT'S ALL JUST ONE BIGMISUNDERSTANDING.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
BUGS ARE ALWAYS GETTING ITWRONG.
LOOK AT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES--HEY, Bs, STOP SCREWING THOSE
BIRDS.
THEY'RE NOT GIANT BEES.
, AND FOLKS, IT'S HAPPENING,BECAUSE THE BUGS ARE IN SUCH A
RUSH TO REPRODUCE THEY CONOTTAKE ENOUGH TIME TO INSPECT
THEIR POTENTIAL MATE'S GENDER.
SEE, THERE'S NOTHING GAY THERE.
IT'S JUST A NORMAL MANLY DESIRETO BANG EVERYTHING THAT MOVES.
AND ONCE WE'RE GOING DOWN THATROAD, WE NEVER ASK FOR
DIRECTIONS.
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?
THE TV MAN EXPLAINS MORE.
>> THE FEMALE PARASITIC WASP ISREADY TO MATE.
HER IRRESISTIBLE PERFUME ISDESIGNED TO ATTRACT ALL
AVAILABLE MALES.
JUST AS THE FEMALE SIGNALS HERADMIRATION, ANOTHER MALE RUSHES
IN TO CLAIM THE REWARD.
FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS, HE DOESN'TNOTICE HE'S TRYING TO MATE WITH
A MALE.
HE DOESN'T REALIZE BECAUSE THESECOND MALE, AFTER CONTACT WITH
THE FEMALE, NOW SMELLS LIKE HER.
>> Stephen:  HEY, WE'VE ALLBEEN THERE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I MEAN, SCENT IS CONFUSING.
YOU WALK PAST THE NORDSTROM'SPERFUME COUNTER AND THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DRYHUMPING A PILE OF CASHMERE
SWEATERS.
INSECTS ARE NOT INTO SOME GAYLIFESTYLE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE OUT THEREHAVING PARADES, EXCEPT FOR THE
ANTS.
DON'T GET ME STARTED ON ANTS.
SOME OF THEM ARE TOTAL QUEENS.
FOLKS, STET YOUR D.VR BECAUSETONIGHT I AM ISSUING A RARE AND
HISTORIC APOLOGY TO THE GAYSOVER HERE.
THE GAYS, I AM SORRY.
FOR YEARS I HAVE CONSIDEREDMAN-ON-MAN SEX A DEPLORABLE,
UNHOLY ABOMINATION.
GIRL-ON-GIRL-- HEY, I'M NOTDEAD.
BUT NOW, NOW I KNOW YOU WEREN'TBORN GAY.
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD, YOUJUST HAD A SAME-SEX
ATTRACCIDENT.
MAYBE YOU MET SOMEONE NICE, WENTON A COUPLE DATES, MADE YOU
LAUGH, SMELLED GOOD, ONE THING IP THING LED TO ANOTHER AND
YOU'RE BACK AT YOUR PLACE GOINGHEY, THIS PERSON HAVING SEX WITH
ME IS A GUY.
BUT OUT OF POLITENESS, YOU DON'TSAY ANYTHING.
MONTHS PASS, YOU MIGHT AS WELLINTRODUCE HIM TO YOUR FAMILY,
AND WHEN THEY ASK WHY YOURGIRLFRIEND IS A GUY-FRIEND, YOU
BLURT OUT, "I MEANT TO DO THIS."
BECAUSE EVEN MARRYING A DUDE ISLESS EMBARRASSING THAN ADMITTING
YOU DIDN'TER TO CHECK UNDER THEHOOD.
SO HOMOSEXUALS, I AM SORRY.
AND I AM MAN ENOUGH TO ADMITTHAT GAYS ARE EXACTLY LIKE
INSECTS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
