YOU GUYS SHOULD WRITE YOURSELF
OUT OF THE METRONOME.
I CAN TELL YOU FOLKS HAVE THE
RHYTHM.
I HOPE YOU HAD A FUN WEEKEND.
I DID AND THE PRESIDENT
CERTAINLY DID.
HE WENT FOR A SWIM IN THE GULF
OF MEXICO.
THEN I CAN ASSUME THE SECRET
SERVICE SCRUBBED HIM OFF WITH
DAWN.
AFTER THAT HE PLAYED MINIGOLF
AND SASHA GOT A HOLE IN ONE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES.
AN ADORABLE ATTACK ON SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS, FORCING THEM TO
FOOT THE BILL FOR HER FREE GAME.
LET'S SEE.
TOOK HIS FAMILY ON A BOAT RIDE.
GOT SOME ICE CREAM AND, OH,
YEAH, HE ENDORSED JIHAD.
>> I BELIEVE THAT MUSLIMS HAVE
THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE THEIR
RELIGION AS EVERYONE ELSE IN
THIS COUNTRY.
THAT INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO BUILD
PLACE OF WORSHIP AND A COMMUNITY
CENTER ON PRIVATE PROPERTY IN
LOWER MANHATTAN.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE BEEN WRONG, AND I OWE THE
PRESIDENT AN APOLOGY.
YOU'RE NOT A SECRET MUSLIM.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT'S HIS EXCUSE FOR
DEFENDING MUSLIM'S
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?
>> I BO -- BARACK HUSSEIN,
OBAMA, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO
SERVE AND PROTECT THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES SO HELP ME GOD.
>> Stephen: AND BY GOD WE MEAN
THIS GUY, NOT THIS GUY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT JUST FEELS WRONG IN HERE.
YOU CAN CITE THE CONSTITUTION
AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS ALL YOU
WANT, BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR
GUTSTITUTION.
DON'T TELL ME MUSLIMS AND AL
QAEDA ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
HERE ARE ALL MUSLIMS.
HERE'S AL QAEDA.
THAT LOOKS LIKE AN EYE.
WHOSE EYE?
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
THE POINT IS... THE POINT, IS
FOLKS, YES, TECHNICALLY,
TECHNICALLY MUSLIMS HAVE
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, BUT SINCE
9/11, WE GAVE UP A TON OF OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, SEARCH
AND SEIZURE, TRIAL BY JURY,
HABEAS CORPUS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT LAST
ONE MEANS.
I THINK IT'S THE LITTLE CAESAR'S
MASCOT.
MOST OF ALL, MOST OF ALL WE HAVE
GIVEN UP THE RIGHT THE PRIVACY.
I CAN'T MAKE A PHONE CALL
WITHOUT HEARING DICK CHENEY
BREATHING ON THE LINE.
HE STILL USES LUNGS, RIGHT?
OKAY.
GOOD.
YOU SEE, AFTER 9/11, THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REALIZED
THEY FAILED TO CONNECT THE DOTS.
SO THEY CAME UP WITH THE
SIMPLEST ANSWER, MORE DOTS
PLEASE.
>> THE MONEY SPIGOT WAS JUST
OPENED AFTER 9/11, AND NOBODY
DARE SAY, I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD BE SPENDING THAT MUCH.
>> THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS
APPARENTLY LARGER, MUCH LARGER.
1,271 GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS
COMPRISE OUR INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY, 1,931 PRIVATE
COMPANIES ARE TIED TO IT.
>> THERE ARE 854,000 PEOPLE WITH
TOP-SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE.
>> Stephen: MORE PEOPLE HAVE
TOP-SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE
THAN HAVE POP-SECRET SECURITY
CLEARANCE.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS I THINK YOU CAN GET.
I WAS THINKING OF THE ONE YOU
RAKE OVER THE THING AND IT GOES
LIKE THAT.
BUT ANYWAY, THE MUSHROOM CLOUD
EFFECT.
I THINK IT'S NUCLEAR POWER THAT
MAKES THAT THING FLUFF UP.
I'M AN OLD MAN.
FOLKS, THESE ARE DANGEROUS
TIMES.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE C.I.A.,
THE F.B.I., THE N.S.A., THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, THE DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, THE
NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY, THE NATIONAL
RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE, THE
NATIONAL COUNTER-TERRORISM
CENTER, THE NATIONAL DRUG
INTELLIGENCE CENTER, THE OFFICE
OF INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT, THE
PURE RO OF DIPLOMATIC SECURITY,
THE INFORMATION SECURITY
OVERSIGHT OFFICE AND, OF COURSE,
THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ON-SCREEN
GRAPHIC OVERLOAD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> IN FACT, IN FACT, FOLKS, WE
ARE NOW PROTECTED BY SO MANY
SECRET PROGRAMS THAT THE
INCOMING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER SAID,
"THERE'S ONLY ONE ENTITY IN THE
ENTIRE UNIVERSE THAT HAS
VISIBILITY ON ALL PROGRAMS.
THAT'S GOD."
THAT MEANS GOD'S A SPY.
THAT'S WHY HE ALWAYS UNDERCOVER
AS A BURNING BUSH OR A GRILLED
CHEESE SANDWICH.
OUR ANALYSTS HAVE TO KEEP UP
WITH A MASSIVE FLOW OF DATA.
THE N.S.A. ALONE PROCESSES 1.7
BILLION ELECTRONIC INTERCEPTS
PER DAY, AND THAT'S JUST FROM
KANYE WEST'S TWITTER PAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, FOLKS, THE SYSTEM IS
CLEARLY WORKING.
AS RETIRED GENERAL JOHN VINE
SAYS, "BECAUSE IT LACKS A
SYNCHRONIZING PROCESS, WE
CONSEQUENTLY CAN'T EFFECTIVELY
ASSESS WHETHER IT IS MAKING US
MORE SAFE," WHICH MEANS IT'S
MAKING US MORE SAFE.
YOU SEE, IF OUR ENEMIES
INFILTRATE OUR SPY NETWORKS,
THEY, LIKE US, WILL HAVE NO
[BLEEPED] IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO... SO... SO... I AM CALLING
ON CONGRESS TO MAKE OUR
INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM EVEN LARGER
WITH A NEW AGENCY TO MONITOR OUR
EXISTING AGENCIES.
THE NATIONAL CENTRAL HOMELAND
SURVEILLANCE BUREAU OF
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AGENCY, IS
NCHSBIAA OR NCHSBIA, WHOSE
INSIGNIA IS AN EAGLE LOOKING UP
ITS OWN ASS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND, FOLKS... AND WE COULD
HEADQUARTER THEM ANYWHERE.
>> IT'S REALLY NATIONWIDE.
>> THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN
THE UNITED STATES HAS GROWN AND
GROWN WITH ABOUT 10,000
LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> 10,000 LOCATIONS.
THAT'S ALMOST AS MANY AS
STARBUCKS.
SPEAKING OF, WHICH I COULD
REALLY GO FOR A LATTE FROM THE
STARBUCKS UNDER MY DESK.
BARRY?
>> YEAH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> LISTEN, BARRY.
>> THAT'S MY NAME, BARRY.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET A TRIPLE
SHOT SKINNY LATTE?
>> YES, YOU CAN, SINCE ALL I DO
IS PREPARE SUCH DRINKS AND
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE.
GREAT.
I'LL GO DO THAT THEN.
HERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: WOW.
THAT'S REALLY FAST, LIKE YOU CAN
READ MY MIND.
>> WHICH I CAN'T.
IT'S HOT SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO COOL IT OFF BY SPEAKING
DIRECTLY INTO THE LID.
>> Stephen: THANKS.
>> THIS ORDER NEVER HAPPENED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: SO HAS OR
INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM BECOME AN
UNMANAGEABLE, IMPENETRABLE
BEHEMOTH OR HAVE WE ACHIEVED
THAT DREAM YET?
HERE TO TELL ME HOW THE ACHIEVE
IT, PLEASE WELCOME THE AUTHOR OF
"CYBERWAR" AND FORMER
INTELLIGENCE CZAR RICHARD
CLARKE.
MR. CLARKE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW, SIR, YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF
"CYBERWAR."
>> I AM.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
AND YOU USED TO BE THE HEAD, YOU
KNOW, GUY OUT THERE WORKING WITH
SECURITY TO TRY TO KEEP THE
TERRORISTS FROM GETTING IT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS THIS NOT A
GREAT THING TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF
MORE PEOPLE, HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF MORE PEOPLE WORKING
IN SECURITY?
MORE IS BETTER.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M A RED SOX
FAN, AND THIS YEAR MAYBE WE
SHOULD HAVE 12 PLAYERS ON THE
FIELD INSTEAD OF NINE.
THAT MIGHT BE BETTER, BUT HAVING
100 ON THE FIELD, THEY'D FALL
OVER EACH OTHER.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN
THE GOVERNMENT.
WE HAVE TOO MANY PLAYERS ON THE
FIELD AND THEY SPEND ALL THEIR
TIME FALLING ALL OVER EACH OTHER
AND NOT GOING AFTER THE BAD GUYS
STIPE STEEP WE HAVE ALMOST ONE
MILLION PEOPLE NOW WORKING IF
INTELLIGENCE.
>> I COULDN'TLE THE YOU THAT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU DON'T
KNOW OR I DON'T HAVE THE
CLEARANCE?
>> NOBODY KNOWS.
>> Stephen: NOBODY KNOWS.
>> THESE AGENCIES OUTLINED IN
THE "WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE
ABOUT HOW LARGE IT'S GOT, IS
THAT ALL THE AGENCIES OR ARE
THERE MORE AGENCIES THAT WE WILL
JUST NEVER KNOW ABOUT?
>> WE'RE DISCOVERING MORE EVERY
DAY.
>> Stephen: WHO IS "WE," BY
THE WAY?
WHO IS "WE"?
ARE YOU STILL WITH THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IF YOU WERE, COULD
YOU TELL ME?
>> WE WANDER AROUND NORTHERN
VIRGINIA.
WE LOOK IN PARKING LOTS AND
ELSEWHERE, AND CONSTANTLY WE'RE
DISCOVERING NEW AGENCIES WITH
VAULTS AND GUARDS.
WE COULD BE ATTACKED AGAIN.
AND LINING UP MORE AND MORE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND MORE
AND MORE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ARE
MAKING A PROFIT ON THIS IS NOT
GOING TO STOP THIS.
IN FACT, THE FACT THAT THE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE
TRIPPING ALL OVER EACH OTHER
COORDINATING WITH EACH OTHER
MAKES AN ATTACK MORE LIKELY.
SOMETIMES SMALL IS BETTER, AND
IN THIS BUSINESS HAVING TOO MANY
PEOPLE OUT THERE RUNNING AROUND
MAKING MONEY, TRIPPING ALL OVER
EACH OTHER, INCREASING THE
CHANCES THAT THE NEXT TERRORIST
ATTACK WILL SUCCEED.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE SO MANY
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS OUT THERE
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT, IS
THERE ANY CHANCE I'M A SPY AND
DON'T KNOW IT?
>> YOU COULD BE AN AGENT THAT'S
BEING USED WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING
IT, YES.
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE PROGRAM COULD
BE A SECRET PROPAGANDA EFFORT
DESIGNED TO DRIVE MUSLIMS IN THE
MIDDLE EAST CRAZY.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
>> Stephen: AND IF I FOUND
OUT, WOULD I HAVE TO KILL
MYSELF?
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO BECAUSE IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEY'LL KILL YOU.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Stephen: WELL, ON THAT
CHEERFUL NOTE, CAN I OFFER YOU A
DRINK?
SIR, WOULD YOU CARE FOR A LATTE?
>> YES, PLEASE, NON-FAT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
RICHARD CLARKE, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING US.
RICHARD CLARKE, THE BOOK IS
