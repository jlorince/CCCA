GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> HI.
>> STEPHEN: WELL, WELL, WELL.
>> COMPETITION, HUH?
>> STEPHEN: ABSOLUTELY.
>> YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DOES IT FEEL?
NOT THE ONLY HOT LADY ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ARE YOU USED TO THIS?
>> I'M JUST NUMBER 16.
>> STEPHEN: JUST NUMBER 16.
HOW DID YOU GET TO 16 WHEN YOU ARE SO FAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU DON'T MIND IF I PLAY HEAD GAMES.
>> IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES OH,
YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU FOR THE IMAGE.
YOU'RE IN THIS NEW MOVIE OUT THERE.
YOU PLAY A WICKED QUEEN.
LET'S SHOW THE GOOD PEOPLE THIS WOMAN NOT BEING SO NICE.
>> I WILL AVENGE YOUR FATHER WHO WAS TOO WEAK --
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S SOME DARK --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THEM ARE MY FIGHTING WORDS RIGHT THERE.
>> STEPHEN: YES, THEY ARE YOUR FIGHTING WORDS.
THIS FILM SEEMS KIND OF A DARK FOR A FAIRY TALE.
IS THIS A DISNEY SNOW WHITE OR LIKE A GRIMM FAIRY TALE.
>> GRIMM.
>> STEPHEN: LIKE GRINDING UP THE KIDS AND MAKING PIES FAIRY TALE?
>> SERVE IT UP WITH THE ONION.
THIS SAY THROWBACK TO THE BROTHERS GRIMM.
THEY ARE REALLY DARK.
THE ORIGINAL HAD THE QUEEN SEND OUT FOR HER HEART AND HAVE HER HEART AND HER LIVER COOKED UP IN ONIONS.
REALLY, REALLY DARK.
WE DIDN'T GO THAT DARK.
>> STEPHEN: SOUNDS DELICIOUS.
>> OKAY "HANNIBAL".
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: YOU GET YOUR YOUTH FROM DEVOURING THE YOUTH OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS MOVIE.
>> OR AS WE CALL -- IT'S LIKE BOTOX IN MEDIEVAL TIMES.
>> STEPHEN: YOU GRAB THEM AND SUCK THE LIFE FORCE AND YOUTH OUT OF THEM.
I DO THAT TO MY INTERNS.
SUCK THEIR VITALITY OUT OF THEIR BODIES.
THIS IS WHY I LIKE YOU.
ME AND YOU HAVE A LOT UNTIL COMMON.
>> STEPHEN: YOUR CHARACTER IS NOT THE HERO AND YET SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
BECAUSE THE OTHER GIRL THERE,
THE VAMPIRE GIRL, WHAT IS HER NAME?
>> KRISTEN?
>> STEPHEN: THE VAMPIRE GIRL DOESN'T LOOK AS PRETTY AS YOU DO IN THIS MOVIE.
YOU ARE PRETTIER IN THIS MOVIE THAN SHE IS.
AREN'T THE PRETTIEST PEOPLE -- LISTEN TO ME NOW.
ONE HOT WOMAN TO ANOTHER --
[ LAUGHTER ]
AREN'T THE PRETTIEST PEOPLE ALWAYS THE HEROS?
IF SHE'S THE BAD PERSON IN THIS WHAT IS THAT SAY BEING LOOK GOING?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH LOOK GOING?
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE NARCISSISM AND VANITY OF IT.
I THINK IT'S REALLY WHAT LIES BEHIND IT.
I DON'T THINK NARCISSISTS ARE VAIN.
THEY ARE OBSESSED OBSESSED WITH BEAUTY BECAUSE IT SYMBOLIZES POWER AND SELF WORTH.
IT'S SAD THAT THIS STORY WAS WRITTEN IN 18 SOMETHING SOMETHING AND HERE WE ARE STILL
TODAY AND WOMEN -- THIS STORY STILL RESONATES BECAUSE WE'RE -- WOMEN STILL DO THE SAME -- I
HEARD THIS AMAZING QUOTE.
MEN AGE LIKE FINE WINES.
WOMEN AGE LIKE CUT FLOWERS THEY TBHILT A WEEK.
IT'S GOT TO STOP.
>> STEPHEN: I'M A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
I'VE MADE THE SWITCH FROM HAND SOME MAN.
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED A HAND SOME MAN.
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED.
>> STEPHEN: I MIGHT SWITCH BACK.
>> YOU WILL HAVE AN EASIER TIME.
>> STEPHEN: MIGHT BE A PAINFUL SWITCH BACK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> CAN I --
>> STEPHEN: YOU'RE ALSO --
[ LAUGHTER ]
TELL IT LIKE IT IS, MAN.
>> KIT BE DONE.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE ALSO IN A MOVIE COMING OUT CALLED PROMETHESIS.
I'M OBSESSED OBSESSED WITH THAT MOVIE.
WILL YOU JUST TELL ME WHEN YOUR CHARACTER AT ANY POINT BURSTS OUT OF SOMEONE'S CHEST.
>> I'M NOT KIDDING WHEN I SAY THERE'S PROBABLY A SNIPER IN
THIS STUDIO WHO WOULD TAKE ME OUT IF I SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT MOVIE.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
SO THE ANSWER IS YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
