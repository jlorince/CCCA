(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M GOING TO SAY I HAD TO
ALL OF NERDDOM THAT MAY BE
WATCHING TONIGHT.
NATION, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THAT APPLAUSE REALLY BRINGS
ME SUCH, SUCH COMFORT.
BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I'M BLUE.
(LAUGHTER)
MAYBE IT'S END OF SUMMER.
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE CASE OF THE BLAHS.
AMERICA'S GOING THROUGH A
PRETTY ROUGH TIME.
WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL
GOVERNMENT, A FRAIL ECONOMY,
AND OUR ONLY REMAINING
MANUFACTURING PLANT IS THE
CHEESECAKE FACTORY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND MOST HUMILIATING OF ALL
WE'RE FALLING BEHIND RUSSIA
IN INSPIRATIONAL LEADERSHIP.
JUST TAKE A LACK AT THESE
PICTURES ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF RUSSIA'S LEADING
NEWSPAPER, "THE NEW YORK
TIMES".
(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, RIGHT OVER HERE, HERE
IS PRIME MINISTER VLADIMIR
PUTIN ROCKING A WET SUIT AND
CARRYING ANCIENT GREEK
ARTIFACTS HE PERSONALLY
DISCOVERED RIGHT NEXT TO
PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV'S HOLDING
A HUGE GUN.
OR IT COULD BE A PISTOL,
MEDVEDEV IS VERY SMALL.
EITHER WAY, FOLKS, EITHER
WAY IT'S LIKE EVERY ONE OF
RUSSIA'S GOVERNMENT POSTS IS
HELD BY A DIFFERENT JAMES
BOND.
MEANWHILE, WHAT IS OUR
PRESIDENT DOING?
RIDING ON A BUS.
(LAUGHTER)
THE ONLY WAY VLADIMIR PUTIN
WOULD BE SEEN RIDING ON A
BUS IS IF HE TRAPPED IT IN
THE WILD AND THEN TAMED.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
BUS FORCE ONE OVER HERE,
ISN'T EVEN AMERICAN.
IT WAS MADE IN QUEBEC.
IT'S A CANADIAN HYBRID.
IT RUNS ON GAS AND BEAVER
MEAT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHILE PUTIN IS INSIBERIA
BAGGING TIGERS, WHAT DID
OBAMA BAG ON HIS SAV ARI
THROUGH THE MIDWEST?
>> HOW ARE YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU GOT A PIE,
COME ON O BAMA, AT LEAST
THROW IT AT A PUMA.
IN TOUGH TIMES, WE AMERICANS
WANT A PRESIDENT WHO IS A
BAD ASS!
IF IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S GOING
TO BE RICK PERRY.
BECAUSE IF AMERICA CANNOT
HAVE JAMES BOND WE'LL
