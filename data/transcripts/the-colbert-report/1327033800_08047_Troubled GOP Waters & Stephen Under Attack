>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, NATION.
OKAY.
>> STEVE, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW I LOVE IT.
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING.
I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT A RALLY
IN SOUTH CAROLINA TOMORROW
AND I'VE GOT TO MAKE A
PLANE.
IN FACT, THIS IS ACTUALLY A
FREE TAPE AND I AM AT THE
AIRPORT RIGHT NOW AND THEY
JUST CALLED MY FLIGHT.
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NOW
BOARDING ZONE 2.
>> Stephen: ZONE 4 [BLEEP]
WELL, AT LEAST I CAN FINISH
MY CINNABON-- SIN A:--
(LAUGHTER)
HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
THAT THAT SPED THINGS UP.
NOW LET'S GET TO THE BIG
STORIES.
FIRST UP, RICK PERRY HAS
DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE TO
SPEND MORE TIME GETTING
LEATHERY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IN A SHOCKER, MITT
ROMNEY WHO CALLED HIS
BACK-TO-BACK WINS IN IOWA
AND NEW HAMPSHIRE HISTORIC
JUST HAD TO REVISE HISTORY.
>> BREAKING NEWS THIS
MORNING COMING OUT OF EYE
WATCH.
THE IOWA GOP IS NOW SAYING
THAT UPON A-- PUN A FULL
COUNT RICK SAN TORE-- SANTORUM
WAS THE WINNER, NOT MITT
ROMNEY.
>> Stephen: FIRST MITT
ROMNEY WON THEN HE LOST.
CLASSIC ROMNEY FLIP-FLOP.
MEANWHILE SANTORUM HAS HIS
OWN PROBLEMS.
FOR CRITICIZING NEWT
GINGRICH FOR DOING THIS
COMMERCIAL, NANCY PELOSI,
LISTEN WHAT SANTORUM CLAIMS.
>> DID THE ONLY PERSON I
EVER SAT ON A COUCH WITH WAS
MY WIFE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THIS
ATTACK ON GINGRICH WAS A
COLOSSAL BLUNDER OF SANTORUM
BECAUSE A DAMNING PHOTO HAS
COME TO LIGHT OF RICK
SANTORUM SHARING A COUCH
WITH A MAN.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY, THAT IS AN
AFFRONT TO THE SANCTITY OF
TRADITIONAL SOFA.
>> YOU START ACCEPTING MAN
ON MAN COUCHING AND IT'S A
SLIPPERY SLOPE TO ACCEPTING
DOG ON COUCHING.
I JUST HOPE THAT THESE GUYS
WERE NOT ON A SOFA BED
BECAUSE IN MY BOOK, THAT IS
JUST A COUCH THAT HAS
FURNITURE REASSIGNMENT
SURGERY.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WITH ROMNEY AND SANTORUM
IN TROUBLE, IT LOOKS LIKE
SMOOTH SAILING FOR THE HMS
GINGRICH.
>> I'M KING OF THE WORLD.
>> THE NEW BOMBSHELL
INTERVIEW FROM ABC NEWS WITH
GINGRICH'S SECOND WIFE
MARYANN.
>> HE WAS ASKING TO HAVE AN
OPEN MARRIAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: LUCKILY, LUCKILY
NEWT'S HEAD QUALIFIES AS A
FLOTATION DEVICE.
AND WORST OF ALL, FOLKS, I
DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING.
LAST NIGHT SOUTH CAROLINA'S
OWN STEPHEN COLBERT WAS
VICIOUSLY ATTACKED BY JON
STEWART'S THE DEFINITELY NOT
COORDINATING WITH STEPHEN
COLBERT SUPERPAC.
JIM?
>> AMERICA IS IN CRISIS.
STEPHEN COLBERT IS TURNING
OUR ELECTION INTO A CIRCUS.
NOW THE SUPERPAC THAT HE
FOUNDED IS RUNNING ATTACK
ADS AGAINST HIM JUST SO
WE'LL THINK THEY'RE NOT
COORDINATING.
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
>> I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE
MUDDY GRUBBING SUPERPACS
MESSING WITH OUR MONDAY TO
FRIDAY ELECTIONS.
>> SOUTH CAROLINA, SEND
STEPHEN COLBERT A MESSAGE.
ON JANUARY 21st, VOTE HERMAN
CAIN BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO HAVE A LEADER LIKE THIS.
>> Stephen: LOOK, I JUST
THINK THAT ROSSA PARKS IS
OVERRATED.
>> OVERRATE, ROVER YATED.
>> FOR THE RECORD, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S NOT
FORGET ROSSA PARKS DID BREAK
THE LAW.
