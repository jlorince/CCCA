(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, NATION--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STENEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: NATION, I'VE GOT
TO TELL YOU, THANK YOU.
FOLKS, I HAVE SUCH GOOD
NEWS.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE GOVERNMENT
IS SHUTTING DOWN!
THERE'S ONLY EIGHT DAYS LEFT
UNTIL CONGRESS'S TEMPORARY
BUDGET AGREEMENT EXPIRES.
THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO GET
OUT MY CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
MENORAH.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
IT'S JUST LIKE A REGULAR
MENORAH BUT IN REVERSE.
YOU SEE YOU EXTINGUISH ONE
CANDLE ON EVERY MAGICAL
NIGHT AS WE MARCH TOWARD THE
COLLAPSE OF THE REPUBLIC.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT KIND OF HURT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
PUT THAT AWAY RIGHT THERE.
OKEYDOKEY.
NATION,--
(LAUGHTER)
