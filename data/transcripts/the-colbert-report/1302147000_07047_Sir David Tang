EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FOUNDER
OF A WEB SITE THAT LETS
CELEBRITIES CORRECT INTERNET
RUMORS.
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.
I HEARD HE RUNS THE WHITE
SLAVERY RING.
PLEASE WELCOME SIR DAVID TANG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, SIR DAVID, MR. TANG, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR YOUR
YEARS OF SERVICE TO OUR SPACE
INDUSTRY.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU ARE A BUSINESS MAN AND ENTER
(SURE, A RESTAURANTEUR.
YOU FOUNDED THE FASHION CHAIN
AND NOW YOU HAVE ICORRECT.COM.
>> IT OFFERS A PLATFORM IN
CYBERSPACE FOR PEOPLE WHO SEEM
TO WANT TO CORRECT LIE AND
MISINFORMATION.
>> Stephen: FAMOUS PEOPLE.
>> OR CORPORATIONS OR
INSTITUTIONS.
>> Stephen: CORPORATIONS ARE
LEGALLY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED
STATES.
>> ARE THEY?
>> Stephen: YES, THEY ARE.
>> BUT THEY CAN'T GO TO JAIL
>> Stephen: NO, THAT'S NICE.
>> YOU CAN.
>> Stephen: YES, BUT MY
CORPORATION WON'T.
>> YOU ARE FAMOUS BUT IT MEANS
THAT PEOPLE WHO WRITE ABOUT YOU
MIGHT LIE ABOUT YOU, MIGHT FEED
MISINFORMATION ABOUT YOU,
MISREPRESENTATIONS ABOUT YOU AND
THE PROBLEM IS INSIDE SPACE YOU
MIGHT WANT TO CORRECT THAT
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE DEAD.
BECAUSE AFTER YOU ARE DEAD
PEOPLE WILL THINK --
>> Stephen: I'M NOT DEAD YET.
IT'S JUST A RUMOR.
I'D LIKE TO CORRECT THAT PART.
>> IT'S ONLY A PREMATURE RUMOR.
>> Stephen: FAMOUS PEOPLE --
GIVE ME A EXAMPLE OF A FAMOUS
PERSON USING YOUR SITE.
>> SHERRY BLAIR.
>> Stephen: TONY BLAIR'S WIFE.
>> SHE FEELS SHE'S BEEN
CONNECTED TO COLONEL GADHAFI'S
SON WHICH SHE DENIES.
>> Stephen: WHICH SON OF
GADHAFI.
>> SAFE.
>> Stephen: I HEARD THEY ARE
BEST BUDDIES.
>> SHE'S ASKED ME TO ASK YOU TO
GO AND LOOK UP THE SITE BECAUSE
SHE'S CORRECTED IT.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU -- WHO
RUNS THE SITE?
YOU RUN THE SITE?
>> I RUN THE SITE.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT THE FAMOUS PERSON COME ON.
KATE MOSS HAS A RUMOR THAT SHE
HAS A HOOF.
SHE DOESN'T WANT THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
SHE GOES ON AND SAYS I DON'T
HAVE A HOOF.
THAT'S A TERRIBLE RUMOR.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE PERSON
POSTING IT IS KATE MOSS?
>> BECAUSE I KNOW KATE MOSS --
>> Stephen: ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE YOU KNOW?
JUST PEOPLE YOU KNOW.
KATE, DID YOU DO THIS?
>> YES, I MORE OR LESS HAD TO DO
THAT AT THE BEGINNING.
BUT AFTERWARDS I HAD TO MAKE
SURE THAT THE PERSON IS WHO THEY
SAY THEY ARE.
>> Stephen: YOU MUST KNOW A
LOT OF PEOPLE.
>> I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I
ALSO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
KNOW A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AND
WHO KNOW A LOT OF MORE OTHER
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YOU WOULD BE THE
HUB AND NEXUS OF ALL FAME IF
THIS WORKS OUT BECAUSE YOU WOULD
HAVE TO KNOW EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS
EVERYBODY TO BE VERIFIED.
>> THE DEGREES OF SEPARATION.
TWITTER DOES NOT VERIFY THE
IDENTITY.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
IDENTITIES ARE VERIFIED.
>> Stephen: YOU DO THAT
PRESENTLY BY --
>> EITHER RINGING THEM UP OR
TALKING TO THEM OR HAVING A
REFERENCE.
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN TOMORROW NOW
THAT I'VE MET YOU, I KNOW WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE.
YOU CAN'T LIE I'VE SEEN YOU ON
TELEVISION, SO I CAN SAY YOU ARE
YOU.
>> Stephen: ONE OF GREAT
APPEALS OF THE INTERNET IS
ANONYMITY.
IT'S A RUMOR MACHINE.
THINGS DON'T HAVE TO BE VERIFIED
AND WHAT IS REAL IS ONLY WHAT
WEIGH DEGREE IS REAL ON THE
INTERNET.
IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SAY KATE MOSS
HAS A HOOF SHE HAS TO HAVE HOOF
REASSIGNMENT SURGERY.
>> THANK GOD THERE'S ICORRECT.
>> Stephen: COULD GADHAFI
HIMSELF GO ON OR THE LEADER OF
IVORY COAST GO ON AND SAY, LOOK,
THERE'S A TERRIBLE RUMOR I
BEHEEDED 1,000 PEOPLE TO PUT
DOWN THE REBELLIONISM ONLY
BEHEADED 500.
>> I WOULD BE STUPID TO ALLOW
PEOPLE TO GOOD ON WITH VICIOUS
RUMORS, INSITE CRIME OR ALLOW
DEFAMATORY REMARKS.
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AS TO WHO
SAYS WHAT ON THAT SITE.
WE'RE A VERY ORDINARY SITE.
WE GO FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: ORDINARY FAMOUS
PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKED ABOUT IN
THE PRESS?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: COULD AN AVERAGE
PERSON HIRE YOUR SITE AND SAY,
LOOK, MY NEIGHBOR ALAN GOLDWATER
SAID I RAEUBGD LEAVES INTO HIS
YARD.
THIS IS A LIE.
>> THEY CAN, YES.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH DOES IT
COST FOR A CELEBRITY TO COST --
FIX THIS?
>> $1 NEW YORK CITY AS A YEAR.
IT COSTS YOU MUCH LESS IF YOU
USE A LAWYER.
A LAWYER WILL NOT MOVE FOR LESS
THAN $1,000 A TIME.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
WHY?
ARE THEY --
[LAUGHTER]
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE PARASITES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THAT'S A RUMOR YOU
MIGHT WANT TO CORRECT.
SIR DAVID, THANK YOU F
