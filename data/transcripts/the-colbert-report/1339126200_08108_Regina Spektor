>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SINGER/SONGWRITER, PIANIST WHO WAS BORN IN THE SOVIET UNION.
I SAID PIANIST.
PLEASE WELCOME REGINA SPECTER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REGINA, HEY, LOVELY, LOVELY TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON YOUR SHOW.
>> Stephen: WELL, I'M A BIG FAN.
WE ALL LOVE YOU HEAR.
YOUR VOICE IS INCREDIBLE.
YOU PLAY BEAUTIFULLY.
I HEARD THE NEW ALBUM.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE TITLE OF THE ALBUM.
IT'S CALLED WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS.
I AM FASCINATED BY THAT TITLE BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SAT IN THE CHEAP SEATS.
I'M USUALLY ORCHESTRA PIT,
THREE ROWS BACK ON THE AISLE,
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE FIRST TWO SONGS, I LEAVE.
WHAT DOW MEAN FROM THE CHEAP SEATS WHAT IS THAT.
>> I THINK YOU SEE A LOT FROM THE CHEAP SEATS.
ARE YOU VERY PANNED OUT.
>> Stephen: YOU SEE THE BACK OF EVERYBODY'S HEAD.
>> YOU HAVE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE.
>> Stephen: ARE THINGS GO ON UP THERE IN THE NOSEBLEED SECTION THAT I WOULD WANT TO
BE A PART OF.
>> YES, YES, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD BE A PART OF.
IT'S THE 99% UP THERE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT WHOLE ATTITUDE.
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHETHER TO TRUST YOU.
OKAY.
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY.
IS THAT FIRST OF ALL LET'S START WITH YOUR NAME.
REGINA SPECTER, OKAY.
THAT LITERALLY TRANSLATES QUEEN GOAT.
YOU SOUND LIKE A SEXY BOND VILLAIN.
AND THERE'S A REASON, THERE IS SOMETHING BEHIND THAT,
YOU REALIZE, THAT YOU WERE BORN IN THE SOVIET UNION.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HOW I DO KNOW YOU'RE NOT A SPY?
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT COME HERE TO TAKE AMERICAN JOBS.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
HOW OLD YOU WERE WHEN YOU CAME TO THE UNITED STATES.
>> I WAS NINE AND A HALF.
AND WE WENT TO IMMIGRATION WITH MY PARENTS AND A BUNCH OF RELATIVES.
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITING.
IMMIGRATION IS, I THINK,
TRAUMATIC FOR ADULTS AND REALLY EXCITING FOR KIDS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU RECOMMEND ALL FAMILIES CHANGE COUNTRIES.
>> I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TRAVELING TO PLACES WHERE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SPEAK ENGLISH WHEN YOU CAME HERE.
>> NO, NOT A WORD.
>> Stephen: DOW SPEAK RUSSIAN NOW.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU STILL SPEAK RUSSIAN.
>> AND I LOVE READING IT.
I FEEL REALLY LUCKY BECAUSE I GET TO READ ALL THE GREAT LITERATURE IN THE ORIGINAL
AND I REALLY LOVE THE MUSIC,
THE OLD BARDS AND EVERYTHING.
>> Stephen: THEY TAKE THEIR MUSIC VERY SERIOUSLY IN RUSSIA.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT-- IF YOU WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE,
WHAT WOULD YOU SOUND LIKE,
DO YOU THINK WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE-- WOULD YOU BE LIKE TIED TO THE CLASSICAL HE PONEO.
>> IT'S HARD TO KNOW BECAUSE THE REASON WHY I STOPPED PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSS SICK
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I WANTED TO, IT'S JUST I WASN'T SORT OF BUILT FOR IT.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU BUILD FOR?
>> I AM BUILT FOR ROCK 'N' ROLL, MAN.
>> Stephen: ARE BACK IN 9 USSR, DO YOU EVER PLAY THAT.
>> I'M GOING BACK.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE GOING BACK.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I LEFT IN 1989.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> THIS SUMMER.
>> Stephen: SO YOU GATHERED ENOUGH INFORMATION IN YOUR-- SOMEONE FROM THE OLD
COUNTRY CALLED YOU UP AND USED THE TRIGGER WORD.
(LAUGHTER) PUMPKIN PATCH, LIKE MUST GO TO MOSKOW.
SO ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT GOING BACK?
>> YOU KNOW, I'M EXCITED.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF NERVOUS TO GO BACK BUT I WAS,
YOU KNOW, AT A CERTAIN POINT IT GOT TO WHERE IT WAS JUST SILLY IT WAS LIKE I HAVE TO
GO BACK AND PLAY FOR THE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY TO GO AS A MUSICIAN AND SEE WHO MY
