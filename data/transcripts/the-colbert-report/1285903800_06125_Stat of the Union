NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I DON'T PARTICIPATE IN
POLLS.
IF MY OPINION IS SO IMPORTANT,
WHY ARE THEY ASKING ALL THOSE
OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TV
SHOWS?
NEVER THE LEGS, THERE ARE SOME
POLLS THAT ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO
IGNORE, OR AT LEAST 75% OF ME
FEELS THAT WAY.
SO IT'S TIME FOR THE FIRST
INSTALLMENT OF MY LONG-RUNNING
SERIES, "STEPHEN COLBERT'S STAT
OF THE UNION."
NATION, I'VE HAD A LONG-RUNNING
BEEF WITH ATHEISTS.
WHAT'S FUN WITH TELLING PEOPLE
THEY'RE GOING TO HELL IF THEY
DON'T BELIEVE IN IT?
AND THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE THAT
THESE PRAY HOLES ARE TRYING
UNDERMINE AMERICA'S GOD-FEARING
AMERICANS.
JIM?
>> YOU MAY CONSIDER YOURSELF A
PERSON OF FAITH, BUT DO YOU
REALLY KNOW GOD?
THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER ACTUALLY
FOUND THAT MOST AMERICANS FAILED
A QUIZ ASKING SOME OF THE MOST
BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT RELIGION,
AND GET THIS, ATHEISTS ANDING A
FORECASTICS DID BETTER THAN
CATHOLICS AND EVANGELICALS.
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S NOT
FAIR.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR ONE THING, AGNOSTICS DON'T
HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS.
THEY CAN JUST CIRCLE ALL THE
ANSWERS AT ONCE.
WELL, I CALL PAPAL BULL ON THIS
POLL.
THIS PEW RESEARCH QUIZ WAS
BIASED BECAUSE IT EXPECTS
CHRISTIANS TO KNOW ABOUT
RELIGIONS OTHER THAN
CHRISTIANITY.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THESE
ACTUAL QUESTIONS.
WHAT IS RAMADAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
SOME NEW FLAVOR OF CUP
O'NOODLES?
THE POINT IS IT'S INSENSITIVE TO
ASK THAT QUESTION SO CLOSE TO
9/11.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY AND WHY SHOULD I KNOW SOME
OBSCURE FACT ABOUT ISLAM ANYWAY?
WE'RE AT WAR WITH THOSE PEOPLE.
MEANWHILE, THERE ISN'T A SINGLE
QUESTION ABOUT NAGA PANCHANI,
THE HINDU FESTIVAL OF BATHING
SNAKES IN MILK WHICH TAKES PLACE
ON THE FIFTH DAY OF THE BRIGHT
HALF OF THE SHRAVAN, ONE OF THE
NINE MOST IMPORTANT ANGAS OF
BHAKTI.
THAT'S JUST
UPANAYANA SANSKARA 101.
BUT THIS POLL IS MEANINGLESS
BECAUSE UNLIKE ATHEISTS, I DON'T
QUESTION MY RELIGION.
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT
SAYS IN AN OLD BOOK WRITTEN BY
SOME KNOW-IT-ALL.
I HAVE FAITH.
THIS REMINDS ME OF JESUSES
PARABALL OF THE MUSTARD SEED AND
THE "PRISONER OF AZKABAN."
KRAMER AND NEWMAN MUST COLLECT
BOTTLES AND DRIVE MICHIGAN IN
MAIL TRUCK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THE HIGHER DEPOSIT FEE.
THEN MOSES SEPARATES HIS HANDS
AND SEPARATES THE PLASTIC FROM
THE GLASS, CLEARING PATH FOR THE
ISRAELITES TO WALK THE
APPLEBEE'S AND MAKE THE DESERT
BLOOM WITH ONIONS.
AMEN.
NEXT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NEXT, INTERESTING POLLING DATA
FROM THE RESEARCHERS AT MTV
NETWORKS.
I BELIEVE THEY'RE CALLED YO MTV
STATS.
ACCORDING TO A CONSUMER STUDY
CONSISTING OF FANS OF "THE DAILY
SHOW" AND "THE COLBERT REPORT,"
AS MANY AS ONE IN TEN SAID
THEY'RE SOONER SWEAR OFF SEX FOR
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THAN BE
DEPRIVED OF EITHER SHOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE?
[LAUGHTER]
HOW IS THIS NOT GETTING YOU IN
THE MOOD?
I MEAN, FRANKLY, I CATCH MY
REFLECTION IN A SHINY SURFACE,
AND I'LL JUMP THE BONES OF
ANYTHING IN A 20-FOOT RADIUS.
MY APOLOGIES TO PAUL BEGALA.
NATION, THE RESULTS OF THIS POLL
ARE DEVASTATING.
I NEED MY VIEWERS TO BE MAKING
MORE VIEWERS.
THAT'S HOW TV WORKS.
YOU'RE ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV.
YOU MAKE A BABY.
THE BABY STAYS ON THE COACH
WATCHING WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT ON,
THEN THAT BABY HAS ITS OWN COUCH
BABY.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A LOVE
SEAT.
IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY BRAVO
SUPPORTS GAY ADOPTION, OTHERWISE
THEY'D RUN OUT OF VIEWERS IN A
GENERATION.
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY I NEED TO
MAKE SURE YOU CONTINUE STEPHEN
