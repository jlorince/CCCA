I APOLOGIZE TO THE BIN LADEN
FAMILY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS A HUGE, HUGE VICTORY FOR
OUR MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES.
UNFORTUNATELY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION BLEW IT BY GIVING
BIN LADEN'S BODY FUEL MUSLIM
FUNERAL RITES AND BURYING HIM AT
SEA.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AND I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE WHOSE RAGE IS OUT.
>> WOULD WE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF
SAVING THE BODY OF BIN LADEN AND
NOT HAVING SENSITIVITY.
>> WHY SAVE THIS TERRORIST THAT
KILLED THOUSANDS.
WE DON'T BUY THIS BURIAL AT SEA
THING.
THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU COULD
HAVE DONE.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD HAVE
FILLED HIM WITH CANDY AND
CHARGED MEXICANS A BUCK A PIECE
TO SLIT HIM WITH A STICK.
CINCO DE MAYO IS COMING UP.
THINK THINK THINK.
EVEN THOUGH BIN LADEN IS DEAD HE
MAY HIT US WITH HIS HORRIFYING
ATTACK ON AMERICA, ENSURING A
SECOND TERM FOR.
BARACK BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A
HUGE BUMP FOR THIS MAN.
>> CANDIDATE OBAMA SAID
REPEATEDLY IF I AM PRESIDENT WE
WILL KILL BIN LADEN.
>> HE HAS DONE THAT.
>> HOW CAN THIS NOT BE A HOME
RUN AS WE TURN TO 2012.
>> BARACK OBAMA'S POLL NUMBERS
JUMPED 9 PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER
NIGHT.
HE IS DOING GREAT.
IF THIS WAS HAPPENING WITH
GEORGE W. BUSH, THE SAME THING
WOULD HAPPEN.
IF WE HAD A SHOE GIVE THE ORDER
TO KILL BIN LADEN THE SHOE WOULD
HAVE GONE UP NINE POINTS.
>> Stephen: QUICK, FIND OUT IF
THAT SHOE IS A REPUBLICAN!
WE KNOW IT CAN RUN.
[LAUGHTER]
EDSADLY -- GOOD LOOKING SHOE.
[LAUGHTER]
A LITTLE GRAY AT THE TEMPLES.
SADLY OBAMA HAS POLITICIZED THIS
HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT BY BEING
PRESIDENT DURING IT.
I NOW YIELD THE MICROPHONE TO
THE CRITICIZER AND CHIEF.
>> OBAMA LAST NIGHT ON
TELEVISION ANNOUNCING HIS SINGLE
HANDED INVOLVEMENT IN SECURING
THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.
HE SAID SO.
I, ME, MY, THREE OF THE MOST
USED WORDS IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
MEDIA APPEARANCE LAST NIGHT.
>> Stephen: RUSH IS RIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT IS A CREDIT HOG.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH IS DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO
RUSH AND OTHER HOG AMERICANS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND OBAMA'S -- OBAMA'S --
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
AND LISTEN TO HOW OBAMA
CYNICALLY USED THIS EVENT TO
GAIN PARTISAN ADVANTAGE.
>> TODAY WE ARE REMINDED THAT AS
A NATION THERE'S NOTHING WE
CAN'T DO WHEN WE PUT OUR
SHOULDERS TO THE WHEEL, WHEN WE
WORK TOGETHER, WHEN WE REMEMBER
THE SENSE OF UNITY THAT DEFINES
US AS AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: WORKING TOGETHER,
UNITY?
THAT'S ARE JUST -- THOSE ARE
JUST SOCIALIST CODE WORDS FOR
WORKING TOGETHER AND UNITY.
HE IS SO DESPERATE FOR A BUMP IN
THE POLES THAT HE DK -- POLLS
THAT HE TOOK THE EASY ROAD OF
KILLING THE MOST WANTED MAN.
IT'S THE SAME REASON FDR KILLED
HITLER.
HE WAS PANDERING TO THE
ANTI-GENOCIDE LOBBY.
SADLY, PEOPLE ARE FALLING FOR IT
WHEN WE KNOW WHO REALLY DESERVES
ANOTHER TERM.
>> IT'S THE RESOLVE OF
PRESIDENTS THAT MAKES A
DIFFERENCE.
PRESIDENT BUSH BROUGHT GREAT
RESOLVE TO OFFICE AND I'M SO
GLAD THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD
THE RESOLVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH.
>> THE TOOLS PRESIDENT BUSH PUT
IN PLACE SERVES HIS SUCCESSOR
QUITE WELL.
>> Stephen: PRESIDENT BUSH MAY
BE OUT OF OFFICE BUT HE LEFT
BEHIND SOME REAL TOOLS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND SURE PRESIDENT BUSH MAY HAVE
TAKEN HIS EYE OFF THE AFGHAN/
PAKISTAN BORDER FOR A
TRILLION DOLLAR DETOUR INTO IRAQ
BUT THAT WAS JUST MISDIRECTION,
BLOODY ECONOMICALLY DRAINING
RAZZEL DAZZLE.
IT'S LIKE THE OLD FOOTBALL PLAY
WHERE RIGHT AFTER THE GAME
STARTS YOU SEND YOUR DEFENSIVE
LINE TO THE GYM TO PLAY
BASKETBALL FOR EIGHT YEARS.
AT THE END OF WHICH YOU RETIRE
AND THE NEXT COACH SENDS A
LINEMAN TO THE STADIUM TO SHOOT
THE QUARTERBACK IN THE EYE.
SORRY, OBAMA DID NOTHING.
BY THE WAY, WHEN IS OBAMA GOING
