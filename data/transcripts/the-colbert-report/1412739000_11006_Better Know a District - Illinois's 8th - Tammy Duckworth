(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THE 8TH IS HOME TO THE WORLD
HEADQUARTERS OF MOTOROLA.

>> IF THE WALL MAKES SOMEBODYHAPPY AND IT'S NOT -- THEN FINE.
BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVECOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

DO YOU MEAN MORE THAN A WALL?
BECAUSE MY PLAN IS MORE THAN AWALL.
I SAY WALL, MOAT, FILLED WITHFLAMES, FIREPROOF ALLIGATORS.
YOU KNOW THESE MIGRANT CHILDRENARE DISEASE VECTORS.
YOU'VE READ THE REPORTS AND I'MSURE YOU'VE SEEN THE REPORTS ON
TELEVISION THAT THEY'RE BRINGINGEBOLA INTO THE UNITED STATES.
>> NO, THEY'RE NOT.
>> STEPHEN: I THINK I MIGHTHAVE CAUGHT IT ALREADY BECAUSE
WHEN I LOOK AT THESE KIDS ON THEBORDER I GET A VERY WEIRD
CLUTCHING FEELING IN MY THROAT,MY HEART SINKS AND MY EYES BEGIN
TO LEAK.
THAT'S GOT TO BE EBOLA, I CAN'TIMAGINE WHAT ELSE.
>> I THINK THAT'S HUMANITY.
HUMANITY? IS THAT CURABLE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: YOU SAID WHEN YOUWERE RECOVERING IN THE HOSPITAL
THAT YOUR SPOUSE STAYED BY YOURSIDE AND YOU WANT GAYS AND
LESBIANS TO HAVE THAT RIGHT ANDSOMEONE BEING WITH THEM.
THAT IMPLYIES YOU THINK IT'SRIGHT FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS
TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
>> WHEN I WAS SHOT DOWN,BLEEDING TO DEATH IN MY
HELICOPTER, AND AN AMERICAN G.I.
CAME TO CARRY ME OUT TO SAFETY.
I DIDN'T STOP TO ASK IF HE WASSTRAIGHT OR GAY.
I WAS JUST GLAD HE WAS ANAMERICAN G.I.

DISASTER.
OKAY?
>> I LIKE MY HEALTH INSURANCE IGET THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU SAID YOU WEREDISAPPOINTED IN THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLECARE ACT AND THAT IT HAD FLAWS
AND IS FAR FROM PERFECT.
>> I THINK MORE AMERICANS TODAYHAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THAN THEY
DID BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CAREACT TOOK EFFECT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU BELIEVEEMPLOYERS SHOULD COVER THEIR
EMPLOYEES' CONTRACEPTION?
>> I THINK EMPLOYERS SHOULDPROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE WHERE
THE EMPLOYEE CAN ACCESSCONTRACEPTION.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT'S THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND
THROWING BLANKETS ON THECONFERENCE TABLE AND SAYING
GO AT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEMEETING? WHAT'S ONE DIFFERENCE?

BELIEFS?

RELIGIOUSLY OPPOSED TO MATERNITYLEAVE.

I THINK THE INSURANCE PLANS DO.
>> STEPHEN: NO, I ACTUALLYPROVIDE IT.
I GRIND UP THE PILLS AND PUTTHEM IN THE WATER BOTTLES.
THE MEN ARE GROWING BREASTS,THAT'S THE HINT.
BUT THEY'RE KIND OF NICE,ACTUALLY.
(LAUGHTER)LAST QUESTION.

>> I DO.
CAN'T YOU HAVE AN EVEN MORESENSIBLE CONVERSATION IF YOU'VE
GOT GUNS? BECAUSE I FIND THAT IFI'M WAVING A GUN AROUND,
PEOPLE GET VERY QUIET AND LISTENTO WHAT I HAVE
TO SAY.
>> THAT'S NOT A CONVERSATION.
IT'S A MONOLOGUE.
YEAH.
SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKEMY GUN.
>> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOURGUN, STEPHEN, BUT WE ALSO SHOULD
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHOSHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BUY GUNS
SUCH AS THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTHISSUES, FELONS, SHOULD NOT HAVE
EASY ACCESS WITHOUT BACKGROUNDCHECKS.
