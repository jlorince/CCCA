>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN
CALLED THE MICHAEL JORDAN OF
NASCAR.
IN THAT HE'S THE CLOSEST
THING NASCAR HAS TO AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
PLEASE WELCOME JIMMIE
JOHNSON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU, SIT
DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I'M A
HUGE NASCAR FAN.
>> I WAS THINKING THAT.
>> Stephen: I ONLY HAVE --
DISH GOT ONE CRITICISM, ARE
YOU READY FOR THIS?
>> PLEASE.
>> Stephen: COULD YOU SLOW
DOWN?
BECAUSE HOW FAST YOU GUY
GOES.
>> DEPENDS ON THE TRACK BUT
210 WOULD BE THE TOP SPEED.
>> Stephen: YOU SEE AT THAT
SPEED, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO
SEE THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON
THE CAR.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IF PEOPLE WANT
TO UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTY OF
NASCAR, NOT EVERYBODY GETS
IT, WHAT IS THE THING THAT
YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE NEED
TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE
GAME.
BASEBALL THEY SAY IT'S ALL
IN THE PITCHING OR IT'S ALL
IN THE HITTING OR IT'S ALL
IN THE STEROIDS.
WHAT-- WHAT IS IT IN NASCAR
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LOOK FOR,
THE UNINITIATED.
>> IT REALLY IS A TEAM
SPORT.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
FOCUS ON THE DRIVER, BECAUSE
THAT IS WHO YOU SEE ON THE
COURSE ON THE RACE ON A
SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
BUT THE DRIVER IS A PIECE OF
THE TEAM.
WE COME DPOINT ROW THERE ARE
SIX GUYS THAT GO OVER THE
WALL TO WORK ON THE CAR AND
AT THE SHOP THAT I DRIVE FOR,
WE HAVE AROUND 515 EMPLOYEES
THAT BUILD MY RACE CAR AND
THREE OTHER RACE CAR FORCE
MY TEAMMATES.
SO IT'S BIG BUSINESS.
IT'S A TEAM SPORT AND WE ARE
ATHLETES.
>> Stephen: AND I'VE BEEN IN
ONE OF THESE CARS.
I MEAN, AND THEY'RE NOT
LUXURY VEHICLES.
IT IS BARE BONES IN THERE,
RIGHT.
NOW YOU HAVE SORT OF BECOME
PART OF IT, YOU'RE TOTALLY
STRAPPED IN.
LIKE THAT CAR IS AN
EXTENSION OF YOU.
>> FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT
WOE WANT TO CONTAIN THE
DRIVER AND NOT LET THE HEAD
OR NECK MOVE IN ANY
DIRECTION.
IT CAN GO FORWARD BUT OUR
HEAD IS ENCASED IN AND MAYBE
TWO INCHES OF A GAP ON THE
LEFT SIDE SO THAT YOU CAN
TURN YOUR HEAD.
THE REST OF YOUR BODY IS
ALMOST IN A COCOON JUST TO
PROTECT NEW A CRASH.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY OF
THOSE NASCARS ARE ACTUALLY
DECEPTICONS.
>> JUST A COUPLE.
>> Stephen: JUST A COUPLE OF
THEM.
IS THERE ANY DOPING IN YOUR
SPORT?
I WILL TAKE THAT AS A YOU
BET THERE IS.
>> I DON'T.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T DOPE.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE NEVER
TAKEN STEROIDS TO MAKE YOUR
PEDAL FOOT BIGGER IS THERE
STEROID TESTING.
>> THERE IS, YEAH.
WE DO HAVE A PRETTY STRICT
DRUG POLICY IN OUR SPORT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU WORK
OUT.
BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU DO YOU
DEAL WITH.
WHAT IS THE MOST WHAT WE
THINK OF AS CLASSICALLY
ATHLETIC ASPECT TO NASCAR.
>> SURE.
I THINK FROM A PHYSICAL
STANDPOINT WORE'S IN THE CAR
FROM THE SHORTEST RACE IS
THREE AND A HALF HOURS IN
DISTANCE, UP TO FIVE AND A
HALF FOR THE LONGEST RACE.
>> Stephen: FIVE AND A HALF
HOURS IN THE CAR.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: SO ARE YOU MORE
WORRY BODE CRASHING AT 125
MILES AN HOUR OR THAT YOU
DRANK TOO MUCH ICE TEA
BEFORE YOU GO.
>> SOME GUY DOES HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH THAT.
THEY HAVE A SMALL TANK AND
CAN'T QUITE MAKE THE
DISTANCE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THE
SEAT COVERS ARE FOR.
>> CORRECT.
IF YOU EVER SEE A GUY
POURING WATER ON HI HIMSELF
IN THE VICTORY LANE, THERE
SI A REASON.
HE'S TRYING TO DILUTE
SOMETHING.
HE'S HAD A PROBLEM.
IT'S NOT CHAMPAGNE STRAYING
OUT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: LISTEN, WE'RE
ALL ADULTS.
>> WE ARE.
>> Stephen: WELL, ARE YOU
SHARING BOTH THE JOY AND THE
STRESS OF IT WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD W YOUR NEW GAME
JIMMIE JOHNSON.
ANYTHING WITH AN ENGINE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DOW MEAN
ANYTHING WANT ENGINE.
>> PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN RACE
ANYTHING.
>> I HAVE THESE TWO
MOTORIZED BAR STOOLS THAT
ARE VERY POPULAR AT MY
HOUSE.
AND THEY WERE THE
INSPIRATION FOR THE GAME.
>> Stephen: MOTORIZED BAR
STOOLS.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: THAT IS
ENCOURAGING DRUNK DRIVING.
ARE YOU-- NO EXAMPLE FOR OUR
CHILDREN, SIR.
>> I DIDN'T SAY YOU HAD TO
HAVE A DRINK IN YOUR HAND
BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR SPOT AT
THE BAR QUICKER.
>> Stephen: IS IT DIFFICULT
FOR TO YOU SIT IN A VEHICLE
RIGHT NOW, THAT CHAIR THAT
HAS WHEELS ON IT AND NOT
WANT TO RACE IT?
>> I LIKE TO RACE.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO
RACE.
>> YOU WANT TO RACE.
>> Stephen: LET'S GO.
COME ON.
RIGHT DOWN HERE.
NOW HERE'S THE RULES, TWICE
AROUND, THIS COFFEE CUP IS
THE FINISH LINE.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: YOU READY TO DO
IT.
>> LET'S DO IT.
>> Stephen: CALL IT.
>> GO
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: JIMMIE JOHNSON,
FIVE TIME
