I WANT THE THANK SENATOR JIM
WEBB AND JOHN LEGEND, WHO WILL
BE OUT HERE IN A MOMENT.
OF COURSE, I HAVE TO THANK THE
SEXY, DANCING HOT DOG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THANK YOU.
TO REALLY STICK IT TO AL QAEDA,
I MADE SURE HE WAS A KOSHER HOT
DOG.
[LAUGHTER]
DON'T ASK ME HOW.
BUT HE USED TO BE A FOOT LONG.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO
DIDN'T SHOW HERE TO HONOR THE
TROOPS TONIGHT, GENERAL DAVID
PETRAEUS.
I THOUGHT HE SUPPORTED THE
TROOPS.
I'M SURPRISED.
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
STEPHEN, YOU PLAY CALL OF DUTY.
HOW WOULD YOU WIN THE AFGHAN
WAR.
>> EXCUSE ME.
>> Stephen: JIMMY, WHAT'S
THAT?
WHAT IS HAPPENING.
GENERAL PETRAEUS, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US LIVE VIA SATELLITE
FROM AFGHANISTAN.
>> ACTUALLY, STEPHEN, I'M A
LITTLE TIED UP RIGHT NOW AS THE
COMMANDER OF THE 135,000
AMERICAN AND COALITION TROOPERS
HERE IN AFGHANISTAN, SO WE TAPED
THIS A MONTH AGO.
>> Stephen: NO, IT'S LIVE,
REMEMBER.
>> WELL, STEPHEN, FIRST I WANT
TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE
TROOPERS IN YOUR AUDIENCE AND
WATCHING AROUND THE WORLD THAT
SERVED IN IRAQ.
>> Stephen: TOO LATE.
I ALREADY DID IT.
>> IT WAS GREAT PRIVILEGE TO
SOLDIER WITH MANY OF THEM DURING
MY OWN TOURS IN IRAQ, AND I WANT
TO PUBLICLY APPLAUD WHAT THEY
HAVE DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND
FOR IRAQ.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STIPE STEEP ALL --
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.

THE SHOW YOU DID IN IRAQ LAST

KEEPING ME AWAY.
