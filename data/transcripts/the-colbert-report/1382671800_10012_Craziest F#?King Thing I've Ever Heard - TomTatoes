NATION, NATION, I DON'TTRUST VEGETABLES.
YOU ALWAYS SEE THEM GROWINGBUT YOU NEVER SEE THEM EAT.
WHAT'S UP.
SO WHEN I CARVE PUMPKINSIT'S NOT FOR HALLOWEEN, IT'S
A WARNING.
THIS IS WHAT I DO TO YOU.
AND THIS VEGE-TERROR IS ONLYGETTING WORSE BECAUSE THERE
A NEW CROP OUT OF ENGLANDAND IT MIGHT BE THE CRAZIEST
[BLEEP] THING I'VE EVERHEARD.
>> WARNING, FOLKS, WHAT YOUARE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CAUSE
YOU TO BURGLARIZE YOURPANTS.

>> IT'S A PLANT WHICHPRODUCES BOTH TOMATOES AND
POTATO.
>> ABOVE THE GROUND YOU CANHARVEST UP TO 500 CHEREE
SIZED TOMATOES BUT THAT'SNOT ALL.
BELOW THE GROUND YOU CANHARVEST YOUR OWN CROP OF
DELICIOUS WHITE POTATOES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S UNNATURAL.
THE ONLY TIME TOMATOES ANDPOTATO SHOULD MEET IS AT THE
BOTTOM OF A STYROFOAM CLAMSHELL.
BESIDES IT'S DISGUSTING.
WITHOUT WOULD WANT A POTATOTHAT COMES OUT OF THE GROUND,
IT'S FILTHY.
AND VEGETABLES SHOULD NOT BEMATING WITH OTHER SPECIES.
THIS IS MIS-VEG NATION, IT'SADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND
ENDIVE.
AND JUST LISTEN, LISTEN HOWTHESE MAD BOT ANNISES
CREATED THEIR VEGETABLEMEDLEY.
>> THE INVENTOR PLANT ISBEING CREATED USING A
GRAFTING PROCESS, BY TAPINGTHE ENDS OF TWO PLANTSING
TO.
IT WORKED IN THIS CASEBECAUSE TOMATOES ARE MEMBERS
OF THE POTATO FAMILY, SOTHEY ARE NATURALLY
COMPATIBLE.
>> TOMATO AND POTATO PLANTSTAPED END-TO-END.
THROW A TURN I IN THERE ANDYOU CAN STITCH TOGETHER THE
VEGETABLE CENTIPEDE.
AND THE NAME, WAIT A SECOND,TOM-TATO, WHERE DID THEY GET
THAT NAME, IT'S HALF POTATOAND HALF TOMATO, IT SHOULD
BE CALLED THE POTE-AT THATTIMEO.
WHATEVER, YOU SAY POTATO ASAY TOE MATHO.

THAT'S THE CRAZIEST [BLEEP]THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
