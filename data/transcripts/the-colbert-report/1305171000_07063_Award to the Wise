EVERYBODY.
NATION, FOLKS, YOU MAY HAVE
NOTICED THAT MY TEETH ARE A
LITTLE BIT WHITER, MY SKIN A
LITTLE SPRAY TANNER AND MY BOSOM
IS VISIBLY HEAFIMY RALLY TO RESTORE SANI
OR FEAR WAS NOMINATED FOR FOUR
DAYTIME EMMYS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, FOLKS, OF COURSE,
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE DAYTIME EMMY
IS THE BEST EMMY.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHERE THE REAL ARTISTS
ARE.
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DOING IT
FOR THE TKPWHREULTS, THE --
GLITZ, THE GLAMOUR, EVEN THE
RESPECT OF THE AUDIENCE.
THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE IT
BEATS PORN.
I HAVE GOT THE MOST COVETED
DEMOGRAPHIC, 70-80-YEAR-OLD
RETIREES, KIDS HOME FROM SCHOOL
AND HOUSE PETS THAT ACCIDENTALLY
STEPPED ON THE REMOTE CONTROL.
FOUR NOMINATIONS.
THAT'S JUST TWO NOMINATIONS LESS
THAN DAYTIME EMMY JUGGERNAUT
TRANSFORMERS PRIME.
THE MOST HONORED AFTERNOON
CARTOON BESIDES STUDIO B WITH
SHEPHERD SMITH.
THAT HAS TO BE CGI.
THOSE EYES ARE LIFELESS.
MY RALLY AND THIS IS TRUE IS UP
AGAINST THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING
DAY PARADE.
THAT'S RIGHT I'M COMPLETING WITH
THREE-STORY SPONGE BOB, THE
GREEN VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL
MARCHING BAND AND SANTA CLAUS.
I TOLD JON STEWART TO BOOK SANTA
BUT HE SAID CAT STEVENS WAS
CLOSE ENOUGH.
EVEN WORSE, I'M UP AGAINST THE
PREMIERE HORSEBACK RIDING TRAVEL
SHOW SAY IT WITH ME EQUITREKKING
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT WITH ME?
[LAUGHTER]
IT IS BY FAR THE BEST SADDLED
MOUNTED TRAVEL SHOW.
[LAUGHTER]
EVEN BETTER THAN THE TRAVEL
CHANNEL'S PACK MULE YACHTING.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO
GO TO THE CEREMONIES, I JUST
HOPE I'M NOT A PER REN YELL
LOSER LIKE ALL MY CHILDREN'S
SUSAN LUCCI.
THAT WOULD TRIGGER MY MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY.
♪ ♪
I'VE GOT TO WIN.
>> DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP,
STEPHEN.
IF YOU DON'T WIN BRENDA WILL
LEAVE YOU FOR KYLE.
>> Stephen: BRENDA.
>> DUN DUN.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE GOING TO
LOSE OH, AND YOU'RE HAVING MY
BABY.
BABY!
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE UP I'M
GOING TO WIN.
SHUT UP KYLE!
I NEED THIS DAYTIME WIN.
EVERY YEAR AT THE PRIMETIME
EMMYS I LOSE TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
