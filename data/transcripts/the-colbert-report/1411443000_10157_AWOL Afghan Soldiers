THIS IS NOT A DRILL! LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, I DON'T KNOW WHY
I HAVE JUST BEEN HANDED A PIECEOF PAPER.

A TIME FOR CHERISHEDTRADITIONS.
UNPACKING THE SWEATERS, BUYINGTHAT FIRST PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE,

MISSING IN MASSACHUSETTS.
THE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN TRAININGAT A MILITARY BASE ON CAPE COD.

ALL IS WHERE WE LOST THESE GUYS.

I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY ON THEEND.
HE'S GOT A --AND CHANCES ARE THEY'RE STILL IN
THE MALL.
WITHDRAWING FROM AFGHANISTAN HASNOTHING ON THE QUAGMIRE OF AN
AMERICAN MALL.
THE AVERAGE MALL IS FILLED WITHLOST SOULS,
WANDERING BETWEEN KIOSKS, LIVINGOFF G.N.C. SUPPLEMENTS AND HOT
PRETZEL SMELL, NEVER TO FORGETTHE HORRORS THEY WITNESSED AT
POTTERY BARN.
(LAUGHTER)WHO BUYS A CAGE FOR THEIR
PLANT?!
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

DON'T TELL ME WHERE "I" AM!
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE "THEY" ARE!

BE SENT BACK TO AFGHANISTAN.
THANK GOD.

THE ONLY REMAINING DANGER IS IFTHEY WERE RADICALIZED DURING
THEIR TIME AT YANKEE CANDLE.

SERIOUSLY.
"DEATH TO AMERICA!"(LAUGHTER)
