[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN [ WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
PLEASE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I HAVE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH THIS SHOW.
I AM A NATIONAL TASTE-MAKER.
WHEN I ENDORSE A PRODUCT ON MY SHOW, IT TAKES OFF.
YOU'RE WELCOME "THE CANDWICH."
[ LAUGHTER ]
SANDWICH IN THE CAN.
IT'S THE FUTURE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, I TRY TO NEVER USE THAT POWER FOR EVIL OR FOR FREE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO TONIGHT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT AN EXCITING NEW REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY.
IT'S A WALLED AND ARMED COMMUNITY OF  UP TO 7000 FAMILIES LIVING ON 3000 ACRES IN
THE MOUNTAINS OF IDAHO CALLED "THE CITADEL."
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE ARMED COMMUNITY OF 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS
OF IDAHO, CALLED IDAHO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, FOLKS, THE CITADEL OFFERS EVERYTHING A PATRIOT COULD ASK FOR, INCLUDING A FIREARMS
FACTORY,
[ LAUGHTER ]
FIREARMS MUSEUM,
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHOOTING RANGES, EVEN A LIBRARY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE AFTER A LONG DAY OF BUILDING GUNS, ADMIRING GUNS, AND SHOOTING GUNS, SOMETIMES YOU
JUST WANT TO KICK BACK AND READ ABOUT GUNS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE, AT THE CITADEL YOU'LL BE SAFE FROM THE FEDERAL THUGS AND THE CO-OP BOARD.
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO BOASTING THAT IT HAS "NO LEADER," THE CITADEL ALSO PROMISES, "THERE
WILL BE NO HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION AND THERE WILL BE NO RECYCLING POLICE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO GO AHEAD AND MIX YOUR GLASS, PAPER AND PLASTIC.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU'RE FREE NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST FILL OUT THE APPLICATION ON THE CITADEL'S WEBSITE, WHICH ASKS
YOUR STANDARD HOME BUYER QUESTIONS LIKE: "ARE YOU NOW, OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A MEMBER OF, OR ASSOCIATED
WITH ANY RACIST GROUP OR SUBVERSIVE ASSOCIATION THAT ESPOUSES THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW
OF THESE UNITED STATES OR ANY INDIVIDUAL STATE?
IF SO, PLEASE ELABORATE."
[ LAUGHTER ]
YES!
PLEASE ELABORATE!
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO HAVE SOMEONE FULLY READ YOUR 700-PAGE MANIFESTO ON HOW THE CIA IS
COLLABORATING WITH FOREIGN BANKERS TO RIG THE RESULTS ON THE VOICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, WAKE UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN JUST SUBMIT YOUR $208 APPLICATION FEE, PAYABLE IN GOLD AND OR SILVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS THE FOUNDERS INTENDED.
OR, AS THE FOUNDERS ALSO INTENDED WITH PAYPAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, YOU MUST SOLEMNLY PLEDGE TO UPHOLD THE CITADEL'S 13-POINT PATRIOT AGREEMENT WHICH
INCLUDES PROVISIONS "THAT EVERY ABLE-BODIED PATRIOT SHALL MAINTAIN ONE AR-15, AT LEAST 5
MAGAZINES AND 1,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION..." AND "ANNUALLY DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY WITH THE
RIFLE BY HITTING A MAN-SIZED STEEL TARGET AT 100 YARDS WITH OPEN SIGHTS," AND "DEMONSTRATE
PROFICIENCY WITH A HANDGUN BY HITTING A MAN-SIZED STEEL TARGET AT 25 YARDS WITH OPEN SIGHTS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
HITTING MAN-SIZED STEEL TARGETS OF COURSE, THE ONLY WAY TO BE
