FOLKS, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN
NEW YORK THIS WAS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S OP DAYS LIKE THIS
WHEN I'M JUST CAUGHT ONE THE
BEAUTY OF THE WORLD THAT I ASK
MYSELF THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS,
LIKE IF DAN RATHER WERE A FRUIT
MONUMENT...
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
...WHAT WOULD HIS FAVORITE BAND
BE?
I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S CALLED "INSPIRE."
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,

IT'S THE DAY WE'VE ALL FEARED.

MAGAZINE INDUSTRY IS RIGHT NOW.

AND WHY HAVE THEY DONE THIS?
>> IT MAY BE AN EFFORT TO
RECRUIT MORE U.S.-BORN
TERRORISTS.
>> Stephen: YES.
MAGAZINES ARE A GREAT WAY TO
RECRUIT DISAFFECTED AMERICANS
WHO MAKE IMPULSE DECISIONS AT
THE CHECKOUT COUNTERS.
[LAUGHTER]
LIKE BUYING A SNICKERS OR
JOINING A TERROR CELL.
I MEAN, HOW WILL AMERICANS BE
ABLE TO RESIST "INSPIRE" WITH
ARTICLES LIKE THIS ACTUAL ONE IN
THE FIRST ISSUE, "MAKE A BOMB IN
THE KITCHEN OF YOUR MOM."
[LAUGHTER]
NOT TO MENTION NEXT MONTH'S
FOLLOW-UP FOR MOM, "HOW THE
SCRUB DOWN YOUR ROOM WHEN HIS
BOMB PREMATURELY GOES BOOM."
[LAUGHTER]
OR FEATURES LIKE KHALID SHAKE
MOMENT'S MANSCAPING TIPS, WHO
FATWA'D IT BEST, AND
