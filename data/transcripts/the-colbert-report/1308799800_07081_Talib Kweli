[LAUGHTER]
>>
>> Stephen: SIR, YOU ARE
SAYING -- AM I SAYING THAT
CORRECTLY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A PRIMARILY
CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE AND JUST
PRONOUNCING YOUR NAME RIGHT I'VE
LOST VIEWERS.
IN YOUR MIND WHAT IS RAP AND
EXPLAIN IT WITHOUT USING RHYME
ON RHYTHM.
WHAT IS RAP REALLY?
>> FOR THE PURPOSES I'M GOING TO
INCLUDE RAP AND 4EU7 HOP.
IN THE HIP-HOP COMMUNITY PEOPLE
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
RAP HIP-HOP IS A VEHICLE, IT'S A
TOOL FOR EXPRESSION AND IT'S
MORE FOLK MUSIC THAN FOLK MUSIC
ACTUALLY IS.
>> Stephen: IT'S MORE FOLK
THAN FOLK?
>> THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S
SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF REGULAR
FOLK.
WHEN FOLK MUSIC GOT MOP YOU LAR
IT WAS STRIPPED DOWN AND IN THE
LANGUAGE OF WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY
SAID.
THAT'S WHAT HIP-HOP DOES WELL.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE CALLED A
CONSCIOUS RAPPER.
DO YOU ACCEPT THAT LABEL?
>> I ACCEPT IT.
IT'S A LIMITATION BUT IT'S A
COMPLIMENT.
I LOOK AT IT IT'S A COMPLIMENT
SO I TAKE IT.
>> Stephen: AFTER THE ARRESTS
LAW THAT WAS GOING TO ASK FOR
I.D. PAPERS FROM MEXICAN
IMMIGRANTS YOU WROTE A SONG
CALLED PAPERS, PLEASE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU, YOURSELF,
MEXICAN.
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE RACE?
>> AN CINCO DE MAYO.
>> Stephen: ONLY ONE DAY A
YEAR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN?
>> YES, I AM.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU
WRITE BILLION MEXICAN CONCERNS
BECAUSE, I MEAN, JUST -- THINK
OF IT THIS WAY, IF COPS ARE
PULLING OVER MEXICANS AT LEAST
THEY ARE LEAVING BLACK PEOPLE
ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
WHICH SIDE IS YOUR BREAD
BUTTERED ON THERE?
>> THE ARIZONA LAW AND WHAT
MEXICANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR,
THE PROBLEM WITH THE ARIZONA LAW
IS THAT IT BASES IT ON YOUR LOOK
AND YOUR APPEARANCE AND
PROFILING.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT US IN THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY CAN
DEFINITELY RELATE TO.
I HAD TO DO A SNOW ARIZONA.
ME BEING A SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS
ARTIST I COULD NOT GOOD TO
ARIZONA AND NOT ADDRESS THE
ISSUE ESPECIALLY WITH ARTISTS
LIKE SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS ARTIST
WHO'S BOYCOTTED ARIZONA BECAUSE
OF THIS POLICY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT
RAP IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW
FROM WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW?
BECAUSE IT'S EXPLODED IN THE
LAST 30 YEARS.
DO YOU THINK IT WILL MAKE THE
JUMP, YOU KNOW N POPULARITY FROM
WHITE SUB UB -- SUB URBAN KIDS
TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN?
>> IT'S A LONG SHOT.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO ONE OF MY
SHOWS.
>> Stephen: IF YOU WEAR THIS
HAT WILL I BE PULLED OVER?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE GOING TO
DID A SONG.
IT'S OFF OF THE ALBUM "GUTTER
RAINBOWS".

A CD MEANS YOU GOT EXTRA SWAG.
>> Stephen: THIS HAD COME FROM
EUROPE OR SOMETHING?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A
