EMPTY CHAIR.
(LAUGHTER) YOU SEE-- YOU SEE, FOLKS,
THE DEAL IS THAT ALL WEEK THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT THURSDAY NIGHT WOULD FEATURE A SURPRISE.
>> INSIDE THE BUILDING A NEW QUESTION SWIRLING OVER ONE PERSON SLATED TO SPEAK HERE
AT THE RNC ON THURSDAY NIGHT.
WHO WILL IT BE?
IT IS A MYSTERY SPEAKER.
(LAUGHTER) GIVEN A HIGH PROFILE SPOT IN THE SCHEDULE, TRACE GALLAGHER, WHO COULD IT BE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES-- YES, LIKE,
LIKE FOX NEWS ANCHORS, I BELIEVE THAT THIS MEANS SOMETHING GOOD IS COMING.
(LAUGHTER) YES, YES, OH, OH, OH, OH,
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, DARLING.
(LAUGHTER) I GOT YOU A SURPRISE.
HERE, IT'S A THIS PSATRY I MADE FOR YOU, IT'S GOT A MYSTERY FILLING.
SO GOOD!
NOW-- YES.
WHO COULD, WHO COULD THE MYSTERY SPEAKER BE?
WAS IT SARAH PALIN?
WAS IT HOLOGRAM RYG AN?
WAS IT ME?
SADLY NO.
EVIDENTLY I LEARNED HOW TO BELCH THE SECOND AMENDMENT FOR NOTHING.
WELL, LAST NIGHT WE FINALLY GOT OUR ANSWER.
IT WAS HOLLYWOOD LEGEND CLINT EASTWOOD.
CARRYING ON A CONVERSATION WITH AN INVISIBLE OBAMA IN AN EMPTY CHAIR.
AND HAVING WATCHED LAST NIGHT'S MYSTERY SPEAKER I CAN SAY WITH SOME CONFIDENCE,
THE MYSTERY REMAINS.
(LAUGHTER) JIM?
>> I HAVE MR. OBAMA SITTING HERE.
AND ES-- I JUST WAS GOING TO ASK HIM A COUPLE QUESTIONS.
BUT-- YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU HANDLE PROMISES THAT YOU HAVE MADE WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING FOR ELECTION?
AND HOW DO YOU HANDLE-- HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT?
I MEAN WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE?
DO YOU JUST-- I THOUGHT,
WELL, I THINK CLOSING GITMO,
WHY CLOSE THAT, WE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON IT.
BUT-- I THOUGHT MAYBE IT IS AN EXCUSE-- OH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHUT UP.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL ROMNEY?
I CAN'T TELL HIM TO DO THAT,
HE CAN'T DO THAT TO HIMSELF.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A POLITICAL SPEECH THIS POWERFUL SINCE THE
FAMOUS LINCOLN BOOK SHELF DEBATE.
(LAUGHTER) AND IT'S NOT JUST ME.
IT'S NOT JUST ME ENJOYING IT,
THE PRAISE WAS UNIVERSAL.
>> YOU SAW HIM BEGIN WITH A VERY ODD SCHTICK BY CLINT EASTWOOD AND I THINK YOU MAY
HAVE WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING ON.
>> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM OR PERHAPS THE EMPTY CHAIR.
>> LOOK, IT DIDN'T WORK.
>> I DO THINK THAT THE TIME MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT,
YOU KNOW, IF THEY HAD IT TO DO OVER THEY WOULD PROBABLY LEAVE IT OUT.
>> THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING TO TOUCH CLINT EASTWOOD'S PERFORMANCE TONIGHT.
>> Stephen: ONCE AGAIN FOR FOX NEWS THAT IS COUNTRIES WALLACE, JUST SHUTTING UP AND WATCHING.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELL,
