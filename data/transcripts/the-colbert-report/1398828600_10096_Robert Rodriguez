( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
MR. RODRIGUEZ, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR COMING ON.
>> HOW YOU DOING?
>> Stephen:  NOW, EVERYBODYKNOWS YOU'RE THE WRITER,
DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, EDITOR,CHOREOGRAPHER--
>> SOMETIMES COOK.
>> Stephen:  SOMETIMES COOK?
ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU A GOOD COOK?
ALL RIGHT?
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING MOVIES FOROVER 20 YEARS.
EL MARIACHI YOUR FIRST MOVIE.
$7,000 TO MAKE THAT MOVIE?
>> THAT'S A LOT WHEN YOU'RE ACOLLEGE KID.
>> Stephen:  I KNOW.
HOW DID YOU GET $7,000 AS ACOLLEGE KID?
I SOLD MY BODY TO SCIENCE.
>> Stephen:  REALLY.
WERE YOU A BLOOD DONOR?
>> I WAS A LAB RAT.
THEY TOOK A BUNCH OUT OF MY ARM,CUT IT OUT AT THE END AND I GOT
$2,000 IN SEVEN DAYS.
>> Stephen:  DID THE SPEEDHEALER WORK?
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  I WAS HOPING YOUCOULD BE WOLVERINE NOW.
>> IT NEVER CAME OUT ON THEMARKET SO I DON'T THINK THEY
PERFECTED IT.
>> Stephen:  EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM "FROM DUSK TILL
DAWN," AND "SPY KIDS."
YOU'VE NOW GOT YOUR OWN CABLE TVNEW YORK CALLED EL RAY.
EL RAY.
OKAY.
I FIND IT AND YOU THREATENING.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I UNDERSTAND.
>> Stephen:  BECAUSE YOU'RENOT-- I MEAN, YOU'RE A MEXICAN
AMERICAN BUT YOU'RE NOT FROMMEXICO.
YOU'RE FROM TEXAS.
>> RIGHT, I'M FROM TEXAS.
U.S. HISPANIC.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE U.S.
HISPANIC.
>> BUT WE COME IN PEACE AND WEHAVE YOU SURROUNDED..
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  THE THING IS IDON'T DOUBT THAT PEOPLE WILL
WATCH THIS, AND THAT'S WHATWORRIES ME IS BECAUSE, A, IT'S
NOT IN-- IS IT IN ENGLISH?
>> IT IS IN ENGLISH, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen:  THEN WHY ISN'TTHE NAME ENGLISH?
EL RAY IS NOT ENGLISH.
>> I CALLED IT EL RAY BECAUSE ELRAY MEANS THE CAPTAIN.
EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES IT FEELSLIKE THE KING.
EVERYTHING YOU WANT IS THERE.
THE PROGRAM IS IN ENGLISH.
I HAVE FIVE KIDS AND I REALIZEDTHEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT
REPRESENTED THEM IN THISCOUNTRY.
IT IS ALSO MAINSTREAM SO ANYONECAN WATCH IT.
YOU DON'T THINK OF "SPY KIDS" ASBEING HISPANIC FILMS.
>> Stephen:  I DO.
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DIRECTEDTHEM, THAT'S WHY.
>> MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOWTHAT.
THEY'D WATCH IT BECAUSE IT'SPOPULAR ENTERTAINMENT.
AND I THOUGHT THE NETWORK SHOULDBE THE SAME WAY BUT FOR THOSE
WHO ARE, DIVERSITY IS REALLY KEYAT THE NETWORK, AND I THINK
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
WHEN WE DID THE RESEARCH, WEFOUND THERE WERE ABOUT 110
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NETWORKS IN THEU.S.
ABOUT 10 WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN.
BUT THE LARGEST MINORITY ISHISPANIC, AND THERE WASN'T ONE
LIKE THIS BUT THERE WERE TWODOG CHANNELS.
I DECIDED TO GO AND MAKE ONE.
>> Stephen:  WHAT LANGUAGE ARETHE DOG CHANNELS IN?
>>I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND.
BUT THE ADVERTISING IS REALLYINTERESTING.
>> Stephen:  HAVE YOU THOUGHTOF STARTING A DOG CHANNEL IN
CHIHUAHUA?
WHAT UPSETS ME IS I THINKIT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
IN 20 YEARS OR SOMETHING,HISPANIC WILL BE MAJORITY IN THE
UNITED STATES?
>> WE'RE 1 IN 6 RIGHT NOW.
AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE 1 IN 3BY 2050.
SO I FIGURED IT WAS ABOUT TIMETO HAVE A NETWORK DIVERSE ENOUGH
TO INCLUDE A LOT OF VOICES.
IT WAS VERY HARD TO BREAK INTOTHE INDUSTRY, SEEING LOOKING AT
YOUR AUDIENCE HOW DIVERSE THEYARE, FOR THEM HAVE TO HAVE A
VOICE.
>> Stephen:  HOW MANY ARE OFHISPANIC ORIGIN?
( CHEERS )THAT'S ALMOST THREE OF THEM.
HOW DARE YOU, SIR.
HOW MANY OF ARE YOU OF A DIVERSEBACKGROUND?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S A BAKER'S DOZEN RIGHT
THERE.
SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OFTHE PROGRAMMING HERE.
THE NEW-- YOUR FIRST ORIGINALDRAMA IS "FROM DUSK TILL DAWN."
THE SERIES, IT PREMIERED INMARCH.
THAT'S BASED ON YOUR OWN MOVIE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, HOW HARDDID YOU NEGOTIATE WITH YOURSELF
TO GET THE RIGHTS TO THAT?
>> IT WAS LIKE, "ROBERT, WHAT DOYOU THINK?
>> Stephen:  LET'S TAKE A CLIPOF THE FIRST EPISODE.
>> Stephen:  LET'S TAKE A CLIPOF THE FIRST EPISODE.
>> SHE'S REAL.
SHE'S REAL.
>> Stephen:  HOW MUCH OF THESERIES IS JUST THAT WOMAN?
IT'S THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN?
YOU MIGHT HAVE A HIT ON YOURHANDS.
>> YOU CAN JUST WATCH THAT OVERAND OVER AGAIN.
>> Stephen:  IS THIS GOING TOBE THE BEGINNING OF AN EMPIRE
FOR YOU?
ARE YOU GOING TO BE THE HISPANICOPRAH?
( LAUGHTER )>> THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL GOAL.
BUT I THINK NOW IT'S KIND OFREALLY WANTED TO CREATE A PLACE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TOCOME AND BE A PART OF THIS
NETWORK.
I REALLY WANTED TO PROVIDE APLATFORM FOR PEOPLE-- I CALL IT
THE PEOPLE'S NETWORK, SO PEOPLEHAVE A VOICE.
>> Stephen:  IT'S ALL PEOPLE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HISPANIC,RIGHT?
>> NOT AT ALL.
>> Stephen:  SPEAKING OFEXPLODING HISPANIC DEMOGRAPHICS,
YOU'RE ONE OF 10 CHILDREN.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen:  I'M ONE OF 11CHILDREN.
>> WOW.
>> IT'S NOT A CONTEST BUT I'MWINNING.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RACE ME IN HOWFAST YOU CAN SAY YOUR BROTHERS
AND SISTERS AND I CAN SAY MINE?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT?
ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THEN WE'LLGO.
ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THEN WE GO.
WE DON'T GO ON THREE.
OKAY.
AND THEN YOU GO FROM OLDEST TOYOUNGEST?
>> I MIGHT BEAT YOU.
>> Stephen:  YOU WON'T.
READY, ONE, TWO, THREE.
JIMMY, EDDIE,...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
EL RAY NETWORK.
