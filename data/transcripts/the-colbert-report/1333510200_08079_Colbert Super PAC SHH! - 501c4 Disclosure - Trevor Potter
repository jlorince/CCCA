(LAUGHTER) I NEED A LAWYER.
PLEASE WELCOME THE FORMER F.E.C.
CHAIR AND MY PERSONAL LAWYER MR. TREVOR POTTER.
TREVOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TREVOR, I'M SCARED!
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE HERE.
THIS JUDGE SAYS THAT ALL THE 501C-4s HAVE TO REVEAL THEIR DONORS.
WHY, WHY, WHY?
>> WELL, THERE'S A FEELING THAT UNDER LAW IF YOU ARE ENGAGED IN
POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND RUNNING ADVERTISEMENTS YOU OUGHT TO DISCLOSE WHO'S PAYING FOR THE AD.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S LIKE SAYING HOW A MAGIC TRICK WORKS!
AND NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW HOW I'M SAWING DEMOCRACY IN HALF.
WHY IS THE I.R.S. STARTING TO POKE AROUND IN THE SUPER PAC GROUPS?
>> WELL, THESE ARE GROUPS THAT HAVE FILED AN APPLICATION WITH
THE I.R.S. AND THEY HAVE CLAIMED STATUS OF SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT!
WHICH IS WHAT I AM!
AND WHAT IS THAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> A SOCIAL WELFARE GROUP IS A GROUP THAT EXISTS TO FURTHER PUBLIC POLICY GOALS.
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION SO THEY'RE.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH POLITICAL ORGANIZATION CAN I DO?
>> I'D SURPRISE YOU AND SAY IT'S ALL A LITTLE GRAY.
>> Stephen: I LOVE THAT.
>> BUT YOUR PRIMARY PURPOSE MUST BE SOCIAL WELFARE.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, DID YOU BRING A BRIEFCASE?
>> I DID BRING A BRIEFCASE.
>> Stephen: EVERY TIME YOU COME HERE YOU HAVE A MAGIC PIECE OF PAPER THAT GETS ME AROUND
WHATEVER PARTICULAR FEDERAL ELECTION LAW I MAY OR MAY NOT BE VIOLATING.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT DO ENOUGH YOUR CASE TODAY?
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR YOU TODAY.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE A TERRIBLE LAWYER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> ACTUALLY, NO, I'M A GOOD LAWYER SO WE TOOK A CAREFUL LOOK
AT THE LAW AND REALIZED THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FILE ANYTHING WITH THE I.R.S. UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.
>> Stephen: SO WHEN I FORMED MY 501C-4, COLBERT SUPER PAC S.S.H., WE DIDN'T TELL THE I.R.S.?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT WE WERE IN EXISTENCE OR WHAT WE'D BE DOING WITH THE MONEY?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE WAITING UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION TO TELL THEM THAT.
>> Stephen: UNTIL AFTER IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: .
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND EVERYTHING'S COOL AS LONG AS WE DON'T TELL THEM.
>> RIGHT, AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT WATCHING TONIGHT, FOR INSTANCE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: WELL, WE'LL EDIT THIS OUT.
TREVOR, SORRY, YOU ARE A GOOD LAWYER.
WHILE I'VE GOT YOU HERE, YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BUTTON, DIDN'T YOU?
>> I DID HEAR.
>> Stephen: IT'S CALLED THE TREVOR MAY I BUTTON AND IT WILL
BE IN ALL THE SUPER PACS SUPER FUN PACKS AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY BRIEFCASE AND IT IS THE
FIVE THINGS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO READ THAT WILL BE IN THE BUTTON.
>> I HAVE A FEELING I'M GOING TO REGRET THIS.
>> Stephen: OKAY, NUMBER ONE...
>> I WAS HOPING YOU WOULDN'T ASK THAT BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS YES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, TREVOR MAY I.
>> I'M NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN IF THAT'S LEGAL.
BUT IT WOULD MAKE FOR AN INTERESTING APPEALS PROCESS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: THAT'S EXCITING.
TREVOR MAY I.
>> IF I WERE YOUR LAWYER I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST IT BUT I'M A BUTTON SO GO NUTS.
>> Stephen: TREVOR MAY I.
>> WELL, EVERYTHING'S LEGAL (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: TREVOR MAY I.
>> EVERY TIME YOU PRESS THIS BUTTON I'M BILLING YOU $200.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: TREVOR POTTER,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TREVOR POTTER, EVERYBODY.
GOOD-BYE, TREVOR!
