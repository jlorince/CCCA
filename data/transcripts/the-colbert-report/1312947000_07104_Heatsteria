(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
FOLKS.
FOLKS, I KNOW IT'S BEEN HOT THIS
SUMMER BUT I REFUSE TO BUY INTO
THE MYTH OF GLOBAL WARMING.
IT'S JUST ANOTHER BIG MEDIA LIE,
LIKE THAT SO-CALLED FINALE OF
FRIENDS.
(LAUGHTER)
I KNOW GANG'S STILL OUT THERE,
NBC.
SHOW ME WHAT THEY'RE DOING!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ARE THEY HAPPY?
BUT ONCE AGAIN THE MEDIA'S
TRYING TO CONVINCE US THAT THIS
SUMMER HAS BEEN EXTRA HOT BY
THROWING AROUND FAKE
TEMPERATURES.
>> THE CURRENT HEAT INDEX--
THAT'S THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY
COMBINED-- FEELS LIKE 116 IN
LITTLE ROCK, 104 DEGREES
OFFICIALLY, 115 WITH THE HEAT
INDEX.
>> THE HEAT INDEX IS ALREADY
RUNNING HIGH.
IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER
SCORCHER.
>> WASHINGTON, D.C. HAD A HEAT
INDEX OF 121.
121 DEGREES IS WHAT IT FELT
LIKE.
>> Stephen: BIG DEAL!
(LAUGHTER)
WHO CARES WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?
I FEEL LIKE I'M 18 BUT I STILL
GET KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE DORMS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FORTUNATELY PUNDITS AND
PART-TIME WEATHER BALLOON RUSH
LIMBAUGH...
(LAUGHTER).
... IS NOT BUYING THE
HEAT-STERIA.
>> THEY'RE PLAYING GAMES WITH US
ON THIS HEAT WAVE.
AGAIN.
IT'S GOING TO BE 116 IN
WASHINGTON.
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE A HUNDRED.
MAYBE 99.
THE HEAT INDEX-- MANUFACTURED BY
THE GOVERNMENT-- THEY TELL YOU
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU ADD
THE HUMID ANY THERE.
116.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME THE HEAT
INDEX WAS REPORTED AS AN ACTUAL
TEMPERATURE?
IT HASN'T BEEN, BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY
WITH DOING THAT NOW.
>> Stephen: RUSH IS RIGHT.
THE HEAT INDEX IS JUST MORE BIG
GOVERNMENT NUMBERS TELLING YOU
HOW HOT TO FEEL!
(LAUGHTER)
JUST LIKE THEIR TIME INDEX TELLS
YOU HOW SLEEPY TO FEEL.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, IT'S MIDNIGHT HERE BUT IT'S
NINE IN L.A.?
WHICH IS IT, PRESIDENT OBAMA?
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO BED!
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I'LL DO RUSH ONE BETTER.
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN GLOBAL
WARMING?
I DON'T BELIEVE IN WARMING.
I SAY THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON
THERMODYNAMICS.
I BELIEVE WATER BOILS BECAUSE
IT'S SCARED OF FIRE AND IS
TRYING TO JUMP OUT OF THE POT.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THESE HOT AIR HEADS HAVE
STARTED INDOCTRINE NATEING OUR
KIDS.
>> SPONGEBOB IS TALKING A LOT
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND HE'S
ONLY LOOKING AT IT FROM ONE
POINT OF VIEW.
>> CARBON DIOXIDE?
>> I'M PUMPING IT INTO THE
ATMOSPHERE, BOY!
THANKS TO GLOBAL WARMING THE
TEMPERATURE WILL SOON GO THROUGH
THE ROOF.
>> CLEARLY NICKELODEON IS
PUSHING A GLOBAL WARMING AGENDA.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YEAH, THIS IS EVEN
WORSE THAN WHEN THEY PUSHED
ALTERNATIVE LIFE-STYLES WITH
DORA THE EXPLORER.
IT IS A CHILLING ENDORSEMENT OF
HUMAN-APE RELATIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, FOLKS.
THE LIBERAL MEDIA BRAINWASHES
OUR KIDS BY SNEAKING PROPAGANDA
INTO THEIR CARTOONS IN A CODE
ONLY KIDS CAN UNDERSTAND.
>> WE ALL KNEE SPONGEBOB IS
POPULAR WITH THE KIDS AND FOR
THE LIFE OF ME I STILL KEEP
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY.
>> I'M WITH YOU.
I DON'T GET IT.
>> IT'S HARD TO EVEN FOLLOW
SOMETIMES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I KNOW, IT'S HARD!
SLOW IT DOWN, NICKELODEON.
HE'S A SPONGE AND HE'S GOT
PANTS?
ARE THERE FOOTNOTES I CAN FOLLOW
ALONG WITH?
>> OBVIOUSLY THE REAL ISSUE HERE
IS THE WAY SPONGEBOB IS TREATING
AS ACCEPTED FACT THE THEORY THAT
HUMANS CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING.
STEVE DOOCY, DROP SOME SCIENCE
ON THEM.
>> WHILE THERE'S NO DISPUTE THE
FACT T FACT THE EARTH IS GETTING
A LITTLE WARMER, THE BIG
QUESTION IS, IS IT MAN MADE OR
IS IT JUST ONE OF THOSE GIGANTIC
CLIMACTIC PHASES THAT WE'RE
GOING THROUGH?
FOR A WHILE WE'RE COLD; THEN WE
GET WARMER.
THEN WE GET COLDER AND WARMER.
WHICH ONE IS IT?
>> Stephen: YEAH, MAKE UP YOUR
MIND, SCIENTISTS.
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE
CONCLUSIONS YOU'VE REACHED FROM
DECADES OF PEER-REVIEWED STUDY
OR, YOU KNOW, THE WAVY ARM
THING?
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE THIS AND THEN IT GOES LIKE
THAT AND THEN IT GOES LIKE THAT.
(APPLAUSE)
MAKES NO SENSE.
COME TO THINK OF IT, THIS ISN'T
THE ONLY THING SPONGEBOB PUSHES
AS FACT.
FOR INSTANCE, HE LIVES IN A PINE
A A L UNDER THE SEA?
HE'S A FRY COOK!
(LAUGHTER)
THE MOST HE CAN AFFORD IS A
