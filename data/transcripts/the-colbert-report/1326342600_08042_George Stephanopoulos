EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE NEW
ANCHOR OF ABC'S "THIS WEEK" WITH
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE OLD
ANCHOR.
PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE
STEPHANOPOULOS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS SO MUCH.
HEY, GEORGE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOW'S IT GOING?
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
THAT'S THE BIG NEWS.
WHAT IS THIS?
>> I HEARD YOU WERE RUNNING LOW.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO DO A
COUPLE SHOTS?
>> LET'S GO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.
OKAY.
YOU FIRST.
>> GO AHEAD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
NOW, GEORGE, I IMAGINE YOU NEED
A HIT OF WHISKY AFTER THIS
DEBATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
>> THAT WAS FUN.
>> Stephen: WE'LL GET TO THAT
IN A MOMENT.
TALK ABOUT YOU'RE RETURNING TO
"THIS WEEK."
>> GOING BACK.
>> Stephen: GREAT SHOW.
YOU'RE GOING BACK.
BUT ISN'T THAT GREEDY BECAUSE
YOU'RE STAYING AT "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA."
WHAT'S NEXT?
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE JIMMIE
KIMMEL SHOW?
>> I ASKED ABOUT, THAT BUT IT'S
IN L.A., SO I CAN'T DO IT.
>> IS IT GOING TO BE PERMANENT?
>> AT LEAST FOR THE ELECTION
YEAR.
>> Stephen: GOOD LUCK.
>> GOOD LUCK TO YOU IN THIS
ELECTION YEAR.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WE WILL SEE.
WE WILL SEE.
NOW, YOU USED TO BE ONE OF THE
GUYS WHO GOES ON SHOWS LIKE
"THIS WEEK" WITH GEORGE
STEPHANOPOULOS, TRYING TO SPIN
THE LIBERAL PLANS OF YOUR GEORGE
SOROS MASTERS, THE CAP AND
TRADE.
DO YOU EVER WAKE UP SCREAMING
THINKING, I CAN'T GO BE THAT GUY
AGAIN WHO HAD TO FACE A GUY LIKE
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS?
>> NO, IT'S FUN.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
COULD GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS TAKE
APART THE OLD GEORGE
STEPHANOPOULOS WHEN HE TRIED TO
COME IN AND SPIN HIS PLAN?
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
AND WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE YOU ARE
COMING ON.
>> Stephen: IF I ANNOUNCE,
GEORGE.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOME SPACE.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
DECISION, AN I'M ASKING YOU AND
THE REST OF THE MODA TO RESPECT
MY AND MY FAMILY'S PRIVACY.
>> GOOD CHOICE.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU TRY TO DO
THAT, BE ETHICAL FOR ONCE?
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S TALK TO THE DECLAIFERRED
CANDIDATES.
OKAY.
THE DEBATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT,
WHAT WAS THE VIBE IN THE ROOM?
WAS IT ELECTRIC?
WHAT'S IT LIKE AT ONE OF THOSE
DEBATES?
>> IN THE LAST DEBATE BACK IN
IOWA, THEY WERE REALLY READY TO
GO.
SATURDAY NIGHT NOT SO MUCH.
THEY WERE TRYING TO FEEL THEIR
WAY THROUGH.
>> Stephen: SO IS IT DIFFICULT
TO BE A MEMBER OF THE PRESS IN
FRONT OF A REPUBLICAN AUDIENCE?
I'LL GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC
EXAMPLE.
YOU GOT INTO A SECTION THERE
WHERE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
CONTRACEPTION.
YOU WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT
CONTRACEPTION.
WHY WAS IT SO IMPORTANT?
WHY WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT
CONTRACEPTION SO MUCH?
DON'T GET ME WRONG, ANY GUY
SITTING NEXT TO DIE AN SAWYER
FOR THAT LONG AT LEAST THINKS
ABOUT IT, BUT WHY DID YOU MAKE
IT PART ABOUT THE DEBATE?
>> IT WAS ABOUT THE RIGHT THE
PRIVACY.
ONE CANDIDATE SAID HE BELIEVES
THE STATE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BAN
CONTRACEPTION.
>> Stephen: LET'S WATCH A
SNIPPET OF IT.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY, DO YOU WEAVE
THAT STATES HAVE THE RIGHT THE
BAN CONTRACEPTION OR IS THAT
TRUMPED BY A CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT THE PRIVACY.
>> THE IDEA OF YOU PUTTING
FORWARD THINGS THAT STATES MIGHT
WANT TO DO THAT NO STATE WANTS
TO DO AND ASKING ME WHETHER THEY
COULD DO I OR NOT IS KIND OF A
SILLY THING I THINK.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OKAY.
HE'S BASICALLY SAYING YOU'RE A
SILLY LITTLE CHILD.
AND THE AUDIENCE IS GOING, YES.
WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE AT THAT
MOMENT?
>> AT THAT MOMENT, I'M THINKING,
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS BET.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS THE BET?
>> DIE AN SAWYER BET ME THAT I
COULDN'T GET MITT ROMNEY TO SAY
CONTRACEPTIONS ARE WORKING JUST
FINE.
I WON.
>>
>> Stephen: FROM THE NUMBER OF
CHILDREN HE HAS, HE HAS NO IDEA
HOW THEY WORK.
OKAY.
IS IT INEVITABLE FOR ROMNEY NOW?
THAT'S THE TALKING POINT RIGHT
NOW, THAT .3% OF THE ELECTORATE
HAS SPOKEN.
IT'S ROMNEY.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IF HE WINS
SOUTH CAROLINA, I SAW YOU MAYBE
FUN OF EVERYBODY, BUT HE'S GOING
TO BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT.
>>
>> Stephen: I'M NOT MAKING
FUN.
I'M CELEBRATING.
>> THERE IS ONE MAN WHO CAN BEAT
HIM IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> I KNOW, GEORGE.
I SHAVE HIM EVERY MORNING, AND
I'M NOT GOING TO REVEAL WHO THAT
MAN IS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THERE'S SOME TALK THAT JOE
BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN
AND SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY
CLINTON, THEY SWITCH JOBS AND
OBAMA GOES ON THE VICTORY
BECAUSE HE'S GOT FIRST FEMALE
VICE PRESIDENT.
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?
>> EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT
THAT.
>> Stephen: GREAT STORY.
>> ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU
RUNNING.
BUT THERE ARE THREE PLACES IT'S
NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT.
HILLARY CLINTON'S OFFICE, JOE
BIDEN'S OFFENSE AND PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S OFFENSE.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK THEY'LL
STAY WHERE THEY ARE?
>>
STEEP
>> I'M PRETTY SURE.
>> Stephen: IT COULD STILL
CAUSE EXCITEMENT.
WHAT IF THEY STAY IN THEIR
PLACES BUT THEY HAVE SEXUAL
SURGERY AND WE STILL HAVE THE
FIRST FEMALE VICE PRESIDENT.
A JOHN TRAVOLTA "FACE-OFF"
SITUATION.
>> WE WOULD BE SAYING PRESIDENT
STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> Stephen: IT DOES HAVE A
RING.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST OF
ALMOST EVERYTHING ON ABC.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEER
