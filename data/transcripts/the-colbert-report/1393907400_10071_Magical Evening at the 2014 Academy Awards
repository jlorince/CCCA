I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.
I MIGHT BE THE ONLY ONE WHOFEELS THIS WAY. BUT FOLKS,
I AM STILL GLOWING FROM THEOSCARS.
IT WAS A MAGICAL EVENINGWHICH MIGHT STILL BE GOING
ON.
IT WAS PRETTY LONG.
(LAUGHTER)PERSONALLY, I LOVE OSCAR
NIGHT BECAUSE ITCOMBINES MY TWO
FAVORITE THINGS, COMPETITIONAND FORMAL WEAR.
THAT'S WHY I ALSO LOVE ICEDANCING AND THE UFC'S
TANGLING TUXEDOS.
SO MANY DESERVING WINNERSLAST NIGHT.
BUT OF COURSE THE BIGGESTWINNER OF THE EVENING WAS
SLAVERY.
>> AND THE OSCAR GOES TO "12YEARS A SLAVE".

I DEDICATE THIS AWARD TO ALLTHE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENDURED
SLAVERY.

ENDURED SLAVERY. LET THIS WINSEND THE RESOUNDING MESSAGE
FORTH:WE'RE EVEN NOW.
OKAY?
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE WHILE IT WAS BAD, IT
WAS BAD, OKAY IT WAS BAD ANDWE DID IT, BUT SLAVERY BEAT
THE THINGS AMERICA LOVESMOST.
ASTRONAUTS, TOM HANKS ANDJONAH HILL YANKING IT.
(LAUGHTER)AND SINCE THE TERRIBLE EVIL
OF SLAVERY RESULTED IN ABEST PICTURE OSCAR, THAT
MEANS ULTIMATELY, SLAVERYHAS A HAPPY ENDING.
(LAUGHTER)JUST LIKE THE TRAGEDY OF
THE TITANIC.
IF THOSE PEOPLE HAD LIVED TOHEAR CELINE DION SING THAT
SONG, I'M SURE THEY GLADLYWOULD'VE DROWNED THEMSELVES.
FOLKS, IT WASN'T JUSTSLAVERYIT WASN'T JUST
SLAVERY THAT GOT ITS LONGOVERDUE RECOGNITION SO, DID
MATTHEW McCONNEGHEY.

>> WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLDI HAD A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON
IN MY LIFE SAY WHO IS YOURHERO?
I SAID I HAVE TO THINK, GIVEME A COUPLE WEEKS, I COME
BACK, HE SAID WHO IS YOURHERO.
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, IT'S MEIN TEN YEARS.
