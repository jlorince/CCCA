WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKSSO MUCH!
FOLKS, YOU KNOW THE MIDTERMELECTIONS ARE OVER A YEAR AWAY
BUT CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY OUTTHERE CAMPAIGNING FOR JOBS IN A
GOVERNMENT THAT NO LONGEREXISTS.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, THIS IS A SAD TIME FOR ME
BECAUSE MY FAVORITEREPRESENTATIVE MINNESOTA
CONGRESSWOMAN AND PIANO TEACHERWHO SITS TO CLOSE TO YOU MICHELE
BACHMANN --(LAUGHTER).
-- IS NOT RUNNING FORREELECTION.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)SHE WILL BE MISSED, I KNOW,
SHE'S A TRUE CONSERVATIVE WITH AVISION OF OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE.
OR POSSIBLE OF A COAT RACK OR ABIRD.
I COULD NEVER TELL WHAT SHE WASLOOKING AT.
FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THERE'S ACANDIDATE OUT THERE FOR HER SEAT
WHO MAY BE ABLE TO FILL HERSHOES.
TOM EMMER.
HE'S PRO-LIFE, PRO-FAMILY,PROSTATE'S RIGHTS AND AS YOU CAN
SEE FROM THIS AD, DEFINITELYPRO-BUSINESS.
>> WHEN THE STORM SETTLES,THERE'S ONLY ONE CLEAR CHOICE.
INTEGRITY EXTERIORS ANDREMODELERS.
>> MY NAME IS TOM EMMER AND I'MRUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN
MINNESOTA'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONALDISTRICT.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TODO REMODELING, SIDING, OR
GENERAL CONSTRUCTION,RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL, I CAN
TELL YOU WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONYOU NEED TO CALL THE FOLKS AT
INTEGRITY EXTERIORS ANDREMODELERS.
THEY'RE THE BEST.
>> Stephen: WOW!
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOM EMMER'S
PLATFORM IS BUT I KNOW WHO'SGOING TO BUILD IT.
(LAUGHTER)NOW WHY -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND --
WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OFCOMBINING ADS FOR POLITICIANS
WITH COMMERCIAL ENDORSEMENTSYEARS AGO?
POSSIBLY BECAUSE IT'S KIND OFEXTREMELY ILLEGAL.
(LAUGHTER)ACCORDING TO THE CAMPAIGN LEGAL
CENTER, A COMMERCIAL THAT RUNSAS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT ON
TELEVISION WILL BE A CLEARVIOLATION OF FEDERAL ELECTION
LAW AND ILLEGAL CORPORATEIN-KIND CONTRIBUTION TO A
CANDIDATE FOR A FEDERAL OFFICEIN THE FORM OF A COORDINATED AD.
COORDINATED?
I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)FIRST OF ALL, HE'S NOT TELLING
YOU TO VOTE FOR HIM.
HE'S JUST TELLING YOU TO CALLINTEGRITY REMODELERS.
>> YOU NEED TO CALL THE FOLKSWITH INTEGRITY EXTERIORS AND
REMODELERS.
>> Stephen: AND THEN HE NEVERGIVES YOU THE PHONE NUMBER.
(LAUGHTER)DOES THAT SOUND COORDINATED TO
YOU?
AND, FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,THIS SO-CALLED CONTROVERSY IS
CLEARLY JUST ANOTHER CONSPIRACYBY BIG LIBERAL MEDIA.
THIS TIME IN THE FORM OFSMALL-TOWN MINNESOTA BLOGGER
SALLY JO SORENSEN WHO SPOTTEDTHE AD DURING A LOCAL BACKYARD
WRESTLING SHOW CALLED "SUNDAYSHOCK WAVE."
(LAUGHTER)BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE BACKYARD
WRESTLING AND YOUR HEAD ISDRIVEN THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE
HOUSE, THERE IS NO BETTERCOMPANY TO FIX IT THAN INTEGRITY
EXTERIORS AND REMODELING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BESIDES, EMMER'S CAMPAIGN HAD A
PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATIONSAYING IT WAS NOT TOM'S
INTENTION FOR THIS TESTIMONIALTO BE USED IN A BROADCAST
CAPACITY OR ADVERTISEMENT FORTHE CAMPAIGN.
YES, HE WAS JUST INNOCENTLYSTANDING IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
UNDER THE LIGHTS WEARING AMICROPHONE THINKING HE WAS DOING
SOMETHING MORE REPUTABLE, LIKEPORN!
UNINTENTIONAL ADVERTISINGHAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
IN FACT, I REMEMBER THIS ONETIME --
>> HEY, MR. COLBERT.
>> Stephen: HEY, BRENDAN, NOWWAS THE BIG GAME?
>> NOT SO GOOD, MR. COLBERT, IKIND OF RAN OUT OF ENERGY.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOUNEED TO DRINK SOME MORE SUNNY D.
(LAUGHTER)SUNNY D IS PACKED WITH VITAMINS
AND MINERALS AND THE BOLDINTENSE TASTE KIDS JUST LOVE.
>> RADICAL!
>> Stephen: HEY, YOU KNOW WHOELSE DRINKS SUNNY D?
NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRISCHRISTIE.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CHRIS?
>> EVERYDAY I HOPE YOU CAN SEEHOW MUCH I LOVE BEING THE
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE IWAS BORN AND RAISED.
(LAUGHTER)>> I LOVE YOU, MR. COLBERT.
>> Stephen: I KNOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SO HATS OFF TO MR. TOM EMMER FOR
SHOWING US A BRAND NEW WAY TOCROSS-PROMOTE CANDIDATES AND
PRODUCTS.
THANKS TO THIS AD, I WILLFOREVER ASSOCIATE YOUR CAMPAIGN
WITH THINGS THAT NEED MAJORRENOVATION.
