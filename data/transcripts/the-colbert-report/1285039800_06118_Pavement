MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE AN INDY
ROCK BAND THAT HAS REUNITED
AFTER 11 YEARS.
I LIKE THEM SO MUCH MORE NOW
THAT THEY'VE SOLD OUT AND GONE
ON "THE REPORT."
PLEASE WELCOME FROM THE BAND
PAVEMENT STEVEN MALKMUS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, STEVEN, NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW YOU DOING?
>> 1,000%.
>> FANTASTIC.
YOU LOOK PRETTY FRESH, READY AND
YOUNG FOR A GUY WHOSE BAND BROKE
UP 11 YEARS AGO.
WHAT'S YOUR MOISTURIZING
REGIMENT?
>> WHATEVER THE HOTEL HAS.
>> GOOD TO KNOW.
NOW, YOU GUYS HAVE GOTTEN
TOGETHER I'VE SAID.
YOU BROKE UP IN '99, RIGHT?
-YEAH.
>>
>> Stephen: DO YOU NEED TO
CHECK YOUR WIKIPEDIA PAGE?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT A GREATEST HITS
COMPILATION HERE.
IT IS CALLED "QUARANTINE THE
PAST."
23 NUMBER-ONE SMASH HITS.
HOW MANY WENT TO NUMBER ONE?
>> UH, NOT MANY.
>> Stephen: NOT MANY.
ANYONE GO TO NUMBER ONE?
>> NOT REALLY, NO.
>> Stephen: NONE OF THEM WENT
TO NUMBER ONE.
YOU'RE A GENIUS, THOUGH.
YOU'RE UNIVERSALLY HERALDED AS A
GENIUS.
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLY INFLUENTIAL
BAND.
HOW COULD YOU NOT GO TO NUMBER
ONE?
[APPLAUSE]
>> IT'S TOUGH TO GET TO THE TOP
OF THE HEAP.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
YOU KNOW WHO WENT TO NUMBER ONE
IN THE '90s, THAT SNOW GUY.
♪ INFORMER
A BOOM, BOOM YEAH ♪♪
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT GUY?
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT GUY?
WAS HE INFLUENTIAL TO YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
>> UM, NO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
YOU BROKE UP IN '99, BUT NOW
YOU'RE BACK PLAYING LIKE HUGE
SREBRENICA -- VENUES 11 YEARS
LATER.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT AS PATH
TO SUCCESS FOR BANDS?
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD TO PLAN FOR,
THAT YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: THIS WASN'T LIKE A
REALLY LONG GAME OF YOURS?
>> TEN YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO
WAIT.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU BACK
IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW?
YOU'VE BEEN OUT FOR SO LONG?
>> BECAUSE IT'S FUN.
>> Stephen: IS THE TOURING
FUN?
>> ROCK 'N' ROLL IS FUN.
>> Stephen: IS TOURING FUN?
WHO IN THE BAND SMELLS BEST
AFTER SIX WEEK?
>> EVERYONE.
>> Stephen: EVERYBODY SMELLS
THE SAME NOW THAT WE HAVE OLD
SPICE BODY WASH.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
YOUR LYRICS?
YOUR LYRICS CAN OFTEN BE
AMBIGUOUS.
>> OPEN ENDED.
>> Stephen: THEY ARE?
BECAUSE I CAN'T OFTEN TELL IF
THEY ARE AMBIGUOUS.
THEY COULD BE DEFINITE.
>> THAT'S I GUESS WHY WE'VE
LASTED SO LONG.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A
MUSICAL HERO.
YOU'RE INCREDIBLY INFLUENTIAL.
IS SOMEBODY ELSE INCREDIBLY
INFLUENTIAL TO YOU, SOMEBODY
LIKE IF THEY DIDN'T EXIST, YOU
WOULDN'T BE ROCKING?
>> REAGAN.
>> Stephen: REAGAN?
I AM WITH YOU, MY FRIEND.
I AM READING YOU 1,000%.
WELL, I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK
SINCE YOU ALREADY LUGGED YOUR
EQUIPMENT IN HERE, BUT WOULD YOU
DO A SONG?
