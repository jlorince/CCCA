>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, BILL O'REILLY HAS DONE
IT AGAIN.
THIS WEEK BILL DID WHAT
CENTURIES OF PHILOSOPHERS BEFORE
HIM COULD NOT DO.
HE PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.
PAPA BEAR WAS DEBATING THE
PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN
ATHEISTS ASSOCIATION, DAVID
SILVERMAN, AND MIGHT I SUGGEST
TO MR. SILVERMAN, IF YOU'RE
TRYING TO WIN CHRISTIANS OVER
THE ATHEISM, IT'S PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST STRATEGY TO LOOK LIKE
THE DEVIL.
( LAUGHTER )
SEE WHAT HAPPENED HERE, FOLKS,
WAS THIS.
THE ATHEIST HERE PUT UP A
BILLBOARD IN HUNTSVILLE,
ALABAMA, THAT SAYS, "OF ALL
RELIGIONS, YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL
SCAMS."
WELL, BILL NAILED HIM LIKE
MARTIN LUTHER KING NAILING JESUS
TO A CHURCH DOOR.
JIM, SHOW US THE LIGHT.
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHY IT'S IN THE
A SCAM, IN MY OPINION.
ALL RIGHT.
TIDE GOES IN.
TIDE GOES OUT.
NEVER A MISS COMMUNICATION.
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: DON'T HAVE ANY
ANSWER TO THAT, DO YOU
MR. ATHEIST PANTS.
TURNS OUT THIS WASN'T FIRST TIME
BILL HAS PROVEN GOD'S EXISTENCE.
>> I SAY, LISTEN, SUN GOES UP,
SUN GOES DOWN, TIDE GOES IN,
TIDE GOES OUT, THERE'S NO
MISCOMMUNICATION.
THE SUN GOES UP, THE SUN GOES
DOWN, THE TIDE GOES IN, THE TIDE
GOES OUT.
NEVER A MISCOMMUNICATION.
I JUST DON'T THINK WE'D HAVE
LUCKED OUT THE HAVE THE TIDES GO
IN, THE TIDES GO OUT, THE SUN
COME UP, THE SUN COME OUT.
>> Stephen: BILL'S THEOLOGY
BOILS DOWN TO ONE SENTENCE:
THERE MUST BE A GOD BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS WORK.
POINT IS, POINT IS, THERE IS A
GOD BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
CAUSES THE TIDES AND WE CAN
NEVER KNOW WHAT CAUSES THEM.
MY BEST GUESS IS THAT THE OCEAN
LEVELS RISE WHEN GOD GETS IN THE
BATH AND LOWER AGAIN WHEN HE
GETS OUT.
AND HE TAKES TWO BATHS A DAY
BECAUSE CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO
HIMLINESS.
GET USED TO IT, ATHEISTS.
THERE IS A GOD, RECREATED THE
TIDES, AND NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN
WHAT CAUSES THEM.
>> ACTUALLY, STEPHEN, I CAN.
>> Stephen: ASTROPHYSICIST AND
DIRECTOR OF THE HAYDEN
PLANETARIUM AT THE AMERICAN
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, NEIL
DEGRASSE TYSON.
FIELD, THANKS SO MUCH.
>> HELLO.
>> Stephen: HEY, SO, NEIL,
NEIL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
>> OH, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE, NEIL?
>> I WAS AT THE PLANETARIUM, AND
I OVERHEARD YOUR CONFUSION ABOUT
TIDES, SO I RUSHED RIGHT OVER.
>> HOW DID YOU GET HERE SO FAST?
>> I HAVE A WORMHOLE.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> SO STEPHEN, THE CHANGING
TIDES ARE CAUSED BY A COUPLE
FACTORS, BUT MOSTLY THE MOON.
>> Stephen: THE MOON MAKES THE
TIDE CHANGE.
SO THE OCEANS ARE WHERE WOLVES.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
>> STEPHEN, NO.
AS THE MOON ORBITZ THE EARTH, A
GRAVITATIONAL FORCE EXERTS A
PULL AND THAT RAISES THE TIDES.
>> Stephen: SO THE MOON
CONTROLS THE TIDES.
SO THE MOON IS GOD?
ALL HAIL LUNA.
VIRGIN BRIDE.
[BELL TOLLS]
WE MUST STONE HERETICFIELD
ARMSTRONG FOR SOILING HER FAITH
WITH HIS BELIEFS.
>> STEPHEN, THE MOON IS NOT GOD.
IT'S JUST AS TWO PHYSICS.
>> Stephen: AND YOU KNOW THIS
BECAUSE?
>> I'M AN ASTROPHYSICIST.
>> Stephen: SO YOU CONTROL THE
TIDES.
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON IS GOD!
KNEEL BEFORE NEIL.
KNEEL BEFORE
