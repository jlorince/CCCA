>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUGUYS, BUT I FOR ONE, I AM STILL
REELING FROM ERIC CANTOR'SSTUNNING PRIMARY LOSS TO A TEA
PARTY CHALLENGER.
VIRGINIA HAS NOT SEEN THIS KINDOF UPSET SINCE ROBERT LEE TURNED
OUT TO BE THE SECOND GREATESTMILITARY MIND OF HIS ERA.
CLEARLY EVERYONE WHO THOUGHT THETEA PARTY WAS DEAD IN THE WATER
FORGOT HOW IMPORTANT WATER IS INTHE TEA-MAKING PROCESS.
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.
THE ONLY SCIENCE THEY ACCEPT, BYTHE WAY.
AND NOW YET ANOTHER REPUBLICANINCUMBENT COULD BE TEA PARTIED
IN MISSISSIPPI.
TALK RADIO HOST CHRIS McDANIELIS IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY
RUN-OFF AGAINST INCUMBENTSENATOR AND SITCOM GRANDPA THAD
COCHRAN.
McDANIEL HAS AN EIGHT-POINTLEAD OVER COCHRAN BECAUSE HE'S
REINFORCED A NARRATIVE THAT THESIX-TERM SENATOR COCHRAN IS OUT
OF TOUCH WITH MISSISSIPPI.
BUT SENATOR COCHRAN RECENTLYGAVE A SPEECH AT WHAT
APPARENTLY WAS A "MATLOCK"CONVENTION.
[LAUGHTER]WHERE HE PROVED HIS MISSISSIPPI
DOWN-HOME ROOTS.
>> MY FATHER'S FAMILY WAS HERE.
MY MOTHER'S FAMILY WAS FROMRURAL HINDS COUNTY UTICA.
IT WAS FUN.
IT WAS AN ADVENTURE.
TO BE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRYAND TO SEE WHAT GOES ON, PICKING
UP PECANS FROM THAT TO ALL KINDSOF INDECENT THINGS WITH ANIMALS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen: YES.
INDECENT THINGS WITH ANIMALS.
NOW THERE'S MAN OF THE PEOPLE.
AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOTAVAILABLE, ANYTHING WARM.
FOLKS, THIS IS HOW YOU WIN ANELECTION BY IMPLYING THAT YOU
BANGED A COW.
COCHRAN'S MESSAGE IS: I'M NOTONE OF THOSE BIG-CITY TYPES WHO
DOES DECENT THINGS WITH ANIMALS.
PERSONALLY I WANT TO THANKCOCHRAN.
I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICHISN'T THAT FAR FROM MISSISSIPPI,
JUST A FEW HUNDRED MILES AS THESHEEP FLEES.
AND ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE DEALTWITH HATEFUL STEREOTYPES ABOUT
SOUTHERNERS.
BUT NOW SENATOR COCHRAN HASSTEPPED UP AND SHOWN THE WORLD A
POSITIVE IMAGE OF SOUTHERNERS.
WE'RE INTELLIGENT, CARING PEOPLEWHO ALSO [BLEEPED] ANIMALS.
I MEAN, WHY, THINK ABOUT IT, WHYDO YOU THINK... WHY DO YOU THINK
WE EAT SO MUCH BARBECUE?
WE'RE GETTING RID OF THEWITNESSES.
[LAUGHTER]THIS IS A GAME CHANGER, FOLKS.
IF McDANIEL WANTS TO HAVE ANYCHANCE IN THE PRIMARY, HE NEEDS
TO KNOCK OUT A FEW TEETH, PUT ONA STRAW HAT AND ONE-STRAP
OVERALLS AND SHOW UP TO HIS NEXTSTUMP SPEECH WITH ONE HAND
HOLDING A JUG OF MOONSHINE ANDTHE OTHER ONE HOLDING HIS
SISTER'S  TITTY. OTHERWISEI'M AFRAID IT WILL BE
SENATOR COCHRAN HAVING THEVICTORY PARTY AT CAMPAIGN
HEADQUARTERS, AND, OF COURSE,THE VICTORY AFTER-PARTY AT THE
PETTING ZOO. BY THE WAY,REPUBLICAN SQUIRREL,
STAY THE HELL OUT OFMISSISSIPPI.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
