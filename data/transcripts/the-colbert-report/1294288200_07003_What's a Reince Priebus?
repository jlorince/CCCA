FOLKS, THIS IS A BIG, BIG WEEK
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
TODAY THE NEW MAJORITY WAS SWORN
INTO THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES, AND MONDAY WAS
THE BIG DEBIT BETWEEN CANDIDATES
VYING TO BECOME NEXT CHAIR OF
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
COMMITTEE.
A CHAIR CURRENTLY CYST OCCUPIED
BY MICHAEL STEELE.
NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M A HUGE
FAN OF STEELE, FRIEND OF THE
SHOW.
CLUTCH HANDBALL PARTNER.
SINCE JANUARY '09, MIKE HAS
SERVED AS THE HEAD OF THE PARTY,
ITS CHIEF FUND-RAISER AND, OF
COURSE, IRREFUTABLE PROOF THAT
IT CONTAINS BLACK PEOPLE.
AS HE SHOWED YESTERDAY, STEEL IS
NOT GOING QUIETLY.
>> I WAS ASKED TO WIN ELECTIONS.
I WAS ASKED TO RAISE MONEY, $12
MILLION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.
WE WON.
>> YES, MICHAEL STEELE HAS DONE
EVERYTHING HIS PARTY HAS ASKED
OF HIM, EXCEPT RESIGN.
BUT STEEL HAS SOME FIERCE
COMPETITION, RAGE.
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW HIS
COMPETITION HANDLED THIS
QUESTION.
>> FAVORITE BOOK.
>> RAEGAN DIARIES.
>> Stephen: GREAT ANSWER.
THOUGH I WOULD HAVE SAID RAEGAN
DIARIES AUDIO BOOK.
YOU DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS A
BRAINIAC.
THEN FORMER BUSH AMBASSADOR TO
LEX UM BERG ANNE WAGNER RAISED
THE STAKES.
>> FAVORITE BAR?
PROBABLY MY KITCHEN TABLE.
OH, FAVORITE BOOK.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: EVIDENTLY,
EVIDENTLY WAGNER THOUGHT THE
QUESTION WAS FAVORITE BAR, EVEN
THOUGH THE GUY RIGHT BEFORE HER
HAD ANSWERED RAEGAN DIARIES.
IT'S AN HONEST MISTAKE.
AFTER ALL, RAEGAN DIARIES IS THE
NAME OF A GREAT BAR IN THE D.C.
AREA.
THEIR SIGNATURE COCKTAIL, THE
TRICKLE DOWN.
THE BARTENDER KEEPS GIVING YOUR
DRINK TO THE RICH GUY NEXT TO
YOU UNTIL HE VEHICULAR HOMICIDES
IN YOUR GLASS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THESE PEOPLE HAVE HAD A FEW.
NOW, NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN THE
BOOK DEPARTMENT, CHAIRMAN STEELE
SHOWED HIS SCHOLARLY SIDE.
>> THE BEST OF TIMES AND THE
WORST OF TIMES.
>> YES, I TOO LOVE THE OPENING
PARAGRAPH FROM WAR AN PEACE.
IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES.
IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES TO
CALL ME ISHMAEL.
IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE
HEAVENS AND THE LOLITA LIGHT OF
MY LIFE, FIRE OF MY SAM I AM.
NOW, AS I SAID BEFORE, I'M A
MICHAEL STEELE FAN.
BUT THERE IS ONE CANDIDATE WITH
A FIGHTING CHANCE TO UNSEAT MY
GUY, HE'S A FORMER HEAD OF THE
WISCONSIN G.O.P. WHO ENGINEERED
MASSIVE ELECTORAL GAINS IN THE
2010 MID-TERPS.
HE'S ALREADY A HOUSEHOLD NAME,
SO SAY IT WITH ME.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT WITH ME?
AND SINCE THIS RISING STAR, IT
BRINGS ME ONCE AGAIN TO MY
LONG-RUNNING SEGMENT, WHAT'S A
RANS PREVIUS?"
FOLKS, THIS COULD BE THE PERFECT
NAME FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
RNC, WHICH I BELIEVE IS
PRONOUNCED RNS, ALTHOUGH AT
FIRST HEARING RNS PRIBUS, IT
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WHAT YOU SAY
WHEN YOU'RE PULLED OVER BY A COP
WHILE STONED.
RNS PRIBUSIOUS OFFICER.
I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT
RNS PRIBUS MIGHT BE AN AN DPAM
FOR SOMETHING, BUT THE ONLY ONE
I FOUND WAS BRIE PENIS CURE.
WHICH I ASSUME IS A WAY TO TREAT
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION USING SOFT
CHEESEFUL IT MAKE SENSE.
HE IS FROM WISCONSIN.
BY THE WAY, I WANT TO ASSURE MY
NETWORK AND THE FCC THAT IT IS
LEGAL FOR ME TO SAY RNS PRIBUS
ON THE AIR MOST OF THE TIME.
FOR INSTANCE, I CAN SAY I LIKE
RNS PRIBUS, BUT I CANNOT SAY I
WOULD LIKE DO YOU RNS MY PRIBUS.
I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THE NAME
CORRECTLY.
>> RNS PRIBUS.
>> RINSE PR IBUS.
>> I'M SORRY, MR. ERICKSON.
RINSE PRIBUS IS WHAT YOU DO
BEFORE ENTERING A PUBLIC POOL.
GET USED TO HEARING IT, FOLKS,
BECAUSE WITH A NAME LIKE
RNS PRIBUS, THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW HIGH HE'LL CLIMB.
TODAY THE CHAIRMANSHIP, TOMORROW
MAYBE A SPOT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL
TICKET.
I'D LIKE THE SEE HIM RUN WITH
GEORGIA SENATOR SACKSBY
CHAMBLISS AS PART OF CHANDLER --
CHAMBLISS-PRIBUS IN 2012.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A WINNING
TICKET TO ME.
