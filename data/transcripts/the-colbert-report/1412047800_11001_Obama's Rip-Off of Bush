LAST NIGHT ON THIS HOUR HAS "60MINUTES" IN WHICH HE FINALLY
ADDRESSED WHY, WHEN IT CAME TOADDRESSING SYRIA, HE WAS JOHNNY
BOMB LATELY.

OF SO MUCH TERRITORY?
WAS THAT A COMPLETE SURPRISE TOYOU?
>> WELL, I THINK OUR HEAD OF THEINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, JIM
CLAPPER, HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ITHINK THEY UNDERESTIMATED WHAT
HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE IN SYRIA.
>> STEPHEN: S'CUSE ME!
BOMBING THE MIDDLE EAST AND THENTHROWING THE C.I.A. UNDER THE
BUS IS KINDA GEORGE BUSH'STHING.
(LAUGHTER)>> IT IS TRUE THAT MUCH OF THE
INTELLIGENCE TURNED OUT TO BEWRONG.

LANGUAGE OF FORCE.
SO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAWILL WORK WITH A BROAD COALITION
TO DISMANTLE THIS NETWORK OFDEATH.
NO GOD CONDONES THIS TERROR.
NO GRIEVANCE JUSTIFIES THESEACTIONS.
THERE CAN BE NO REASONING, NONEGOTIATION WITH THIS BRAND OF

ONCE IN A WHILE TO FIND OUT WHATTOOTHPASTE IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE
LIKE!

HIM OUT ON THIS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SURE SOUNDEDA LOT LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH
YESTERDAY.
>> HE'S SOUNDING A LOT LIKE HIMTHESE DAYS.

OBAMA?
>> THIS IS A SPEECH WHERE IF YOUCLOSED YOUR EYES, YOU COULD HAVE
HEARD GEORGE W. BUSH GIVING THISSPEECH.

PHRASE -- "NETWORK OF DEATH"-- INTO THESAURUS.COM,
GEORGE W. BUSH'S "AXIS OF EVIL"COULD VERY WELL COME OUT.
YES, IT COULD VERY WELL COMEOUT.
NO, I TRIED IT AND IT DOESN'TCOME OUT, BUT IF I DIDN'T, IT
MIGHT HAVE.
CLEARLY, PRESIDENT KUMBAYA ISJUST TRYING TO LOOK TOUGH IN THE
MIDDLE EAST BY MAD-LIBBING THEGREATEST HITS OF THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION.
I DREAD THE DAY WHEN "MISSIONACCOMPLISHED" BECOMES "JOB DID."
