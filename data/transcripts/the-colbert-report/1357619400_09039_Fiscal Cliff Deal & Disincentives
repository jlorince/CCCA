PENGUINS.
I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY.
WE'LL SEE HOW THE YEAR SHAKES OUT.
OKAY.
NOW, FOLKS, BEFORE I WENT ON BREAK, ALL THE NEWS WAS ABOUT A LOOMING ECONOMIC CATACLYSM KNOWN
AS THE FISCAL CLIFF.
I DIDN'T WATCH ANY NEWS OVER THE BREAK BUT I ASSUME WE DID NOT PLUNGE OVER THIS CLIFF BECAUSE I
HAVE NOT SPENT THE LAST WEEK FIGHTING SEAGULLS FOR DISCARDED HOT DOG BUNS.
AS A MEMBER OF THE TOP 1% I WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD MY EYES PECKED OUT BY AN ALBATROSS THAN
SUFFER THE DEAL ACCEPTED BY REPUBLICANS FROM OWE BALM YANCH PRESIDENT OBAMA INCREASED TAXES
ON THE RICH.
>> TAXES GO UP FOR SINGLES MAKING OVER $400,000 OR MORE.
IT GOES FROM 35% TO 39.6%.
>> 39.6%, MR. PRESIDENT?
HOW IS KIM-YE SUPPOSED TO AFFORD A BABY NOW?
NATION, NATION, LISTEN -- I DON'T WANT TO BRAG -- BUT I MAKE IN EXCESS OF 400 LARGE A YEAR
AND BY LARGE I MEAN BIGGIE FRY, BIGGIE COKE.
OKAY?
I'M SUCCESSFUL.
IF THE GOVERNMENT PUNISHES ME FOR IT WITH THE TAX INCREASE MAYBE I WON'T WANT TO BE ANYMORE.
>> IT LOWERS THE INCENTIVE OF THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO TAKE RISKS AND TO INKNOW RATE IS AND
TO CREATE.
>> IT'S A DISINCENTIVE TO WORK.
>> WHY DO WE WANT TO PUNISH SUCCESS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD?
WHY PUNISH SUCCESS?
HOW CAN WE MAKERS CONTINUE TO MAKE WHAT WE MAKE.
WHY SCREEN A PERSONAL HUSBAND AND WIFE OMELET TEAM?
MARIA, UM BETTERO, I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK GOD THIS HORRIBLE DEAL HAS LOOPHOLES.
>> INCLUDED IN THIS BILL WERE TAX BREAKS FOR PORTO RICAN -- PUERTO RICAN RUM GROWINGS, ALGAE
GROWERS CHNCH --
>> Stephen: WHICH IS WHY I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE CAPTAIN COLBERT'S POND RUM.
MMMMM, MMMMM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S THE ONLY CARIBBEAN SPIRIT MADE WITH CHUNKS OF REAL ALLEGE YEAH.
