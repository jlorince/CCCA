>> Stephen: WELL KOCH BACK,

NATION, BEFORE WE DEBUT MY
NEW HIT SINGLE I'M HONORED
TO BE JOINED BY MY PRODUCER,
MR. JACK WHITE.
JACK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
BEING HERE, NOW YOU AND I
HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOME OF TO
THE.
>> WE HAVE.
>> Stephen: WE TALKED ROCK.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MY LOOK.
WE'VE SHOT A RECORD COVER.
WE'VE TRIED TO SELL YOGURT.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR A JACK
WHITE TO WORK WITH A STEPHEN
COLBERT?
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT WAS VERY PLEASURABLE
FROM START TO FINISH, I GOT
TO SAY.
>> Stephen: ME TOO, MAN, ME

THE FINISH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
NOW MY FIRST RECORD WHICH
OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY KNOWS IS
CHARLENE I'M RIGHT BEHIND
YOU.
AND THE NEW RECORD IS CALLED
CHARLENE TWO I'M OVER YOU.
>> PARENTHESIS I'M OVER YOU.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL
FINALLY SEND THE MESSAGE TO
HER THAT I'M OVER HER?
OR SHOULD I DO ANOTHER
RECORD CRAWLED CHARLENE DID
YOU GET MY LAST RECORD?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK IT'S
DONE IT.
>> YEAH, OR MAYBE JUST MOVE
ON TO ANOTHER GIRL MIGHT BE
A GOOD IDEA.

>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO DID WE EVER RECORD A
SONG.
>> YEAH.

CHARLENE TWO I'M OVER YOU.
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.
AND THERE'S EVEN A LIMITED
EDITION RED, WHITE AND BLUE
VERSION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BLING, BLING.
NOW I LOVE VINYL.
I'M ON ORIGINALIST.
AND I BELIEVE-- I LOVE WAX
CYLINDERS, I'M AN EDISON
MAN.
EVERYTHING AFTER MARY HAD A
LITTLE LAMB, KIND OF
DERIVATIVE.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
YOU LIKE THE WARMTH S THAT
WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THE
SOUND.
>> I DO.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING IT
IN YOUR HANDS, YOU CAN HOLD
IT.
YOU CAN'T HOLD AN MP3, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: IS THIS
AVAILABLE AS AN MP3.
>> IT IS.
I UNDERSTAND THE PORTABILITY
OF THAT.
BUT THIS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
PUTTING AN OBJECT AND
DROPPING A NEED IL AND
SITTING DOWN AND LOOKING AT
THE COVER AND READING IT.
THAT IS THE ROMANCE OF THE
THAT WE ARE LOSING IN THIS
GENERATION.
YOU'RE BRINGING IT BACK NOW.
>> Stephen: SO ARE YOU.
NO ARE YOU KIND OF TOO.
(APPLAUSE)
>> IS THIS A PETROLEUM
PRODUCT.
>> IT IS ANTI-GREEN
TECHNOLOGY, YES.
THE OPPOSITE.
>> Stephen: GOOD, BECAUSE I
WANT TO BE CLOGGING
LANDFILLS FOR CENTURIES.
NOW HOW CAN PEOPLE-- CAN
THEY GET THIS ON ITUNES.
>> THEY CAN ORDER IT ON
ITUNES OR THIRD MAN RECORD
ON THE INTERNET AND ALSO YOU
CAN JUST MAIL ORDER AND GET
IT AT YOUR LOCAL RECORD SHOP
WHICH I THINK IS THE BEST
THING TO DO IS GO TO YOUR
LOCAL RECORD STORE, MOM AND
POP ESTABLISHMENT ESPECIALLY.
>> Stephen: GREAT WAY TO
MEET-- GREAT WAY TO MEET
GIRLS.
>> IT IS A GREAT WAY TO MEET
GIRLS.
>> Stephen: AND ALSO
TOMORROW YOU CAN SEE ME AND
