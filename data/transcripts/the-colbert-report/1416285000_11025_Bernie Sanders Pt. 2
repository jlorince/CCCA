>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR BERNIESANDERS.
YOU'RE A GUY WHO'S A RABBLEROUSER, YOU WHIP PEOPLE UP.
(LAUGHTER)THAT MAY PLAY IN VERMONT, BUT
THERE IS TALK YOU MAY BETHROWING YOUR HAT INTO THE
PRESIDENTIAL RING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SIR, I ONLY HAVE 15 MORE SHOWS,
IF YOU WANT THE COLBERT BUMP.
(LAUGHTER)ARE YOU READY TO DECLARE TONIGHT
IN FRONT OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I CAN'T CONTROL THEM!
THEY LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE ONMY SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME
NEWS?
>> THE NEWS IS I AM THINKINGABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE ACAMPAIGN MANAGER.
IS HE DOING NOTHING?
IS THAT JUST SOCIALIST HANDOUTS?
(LAUGHTER)>> WE HAVEN'T PUT ANYBODY ON THE
CAMPAIGN STAFF YET.
WHAT WE HAVE TO ASCERTAIN ISWHETHER OR NOT IN THIS COUNTRY
THIS IS THE APPETITE AND THEWILLINGNESS TO PUT TOGETHER A
STRONG GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT TOTAKE ON THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
UNDERTAKING, AND WHEN YOU'RERUNNING AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE
UNLIMITED SUMS OF MONEY, THEQUESTION IS HOW YOU RAISE THE
$20 AND $40 CONTRIBUTIONS THEMONEY YOU NEED TO RUN A SERIOUS
CAMPAIGN.
THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WE'RELOOKING AT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENTCAN...
ACHIEVE THINGS?
(LAUGHTER)A CONTROVERSIAL STANCE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU NAME ACOUNTRY WHERE THAT'S WORKED OUT?
>> I THINK ONE OF THE SAD THINGSABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS IS WE
DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUTWHAT'S GOING ON IN A NUMBER OF
OTHER COUNTRIES.
IN DENMARK, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUHAVE A VERY GOOD HEALTHCARE
SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES QUALITYCARE FOR ALL ITS PEOPLE WITHOUT
OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSE, AT A TIMEWHEN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BY THE
MILLIONS ARE HAVING A HARD TIMEAFFORDING TO GO TO COLLEGE, ARE
GRADUATING DEEPLY IN DEBT, INDENMARK, COLLEGE AND GRADUATE
SCHOOL IS WITHOUT ANYOUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: I DO WANT TO POINT
ONE THING OUT TO YOU, SENATOR,IS THAT DENMARK HAS 5.5 MILLION
PEOPLE, AND I HAVE MORE THANTHAT ON MY TWITTER FEED.
SO I'M GOING TO TWEET SOMETHINGHERE TONIGHT.
HOLD ON.
SUCK IT, DENMARK.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT.
FOLKS, RETWEET THAT.
IF I GET MORE RETWEETS THANTHERE ARE PEOPLE IN DENMARK,
YOU HAVE TO MOVE THERE.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING ME!
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS -- MAYBEFOR PRESIDENT!
