(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR AND THE
STAR OF A NEW DOCUMENTARY "KUMARE: THE TRUE STORY OF A FLASE PROPHET."
PLEASE BLINDLY WELCOME VIKRAM GANDHI.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY!
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, VIKRAM,
HOW ARE YOU?
>> GOOD.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR AND PROTAGONIST OF THIS NEW
DOCUMENTARY "KUMAR." WHO IS KUMAR AND WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS?
>> KUMAR SECTION A FICTIONAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND I WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE IN WHICH I
IMPERSONATED A RELIGIOUS LEADER FROM A FICTIONAL COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: WHAT COUNTRY WERE YOU FROM?
>> FROM ALI KASH, NEAR THE AREA NEAR TIBET, PAKISTAN.
>> Stephen: JUST THAT AREA.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ALI KASH?
O MY GOSH, ALI KASH.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO IMPERSONATE A SPIRITUAL LEADER?
>> I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN YOU IMPERSONATE SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT
YOU CAN SORT OF SEE SOMETHING THAT'S MORE TRUE IN THE WORLD.
SO I...
(LAUGHTER) SO I THOUGHT MAYBE....
>> Stephen: YOU'VE LOST ME.
I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'VE LOSTED ME.
WE'LL PLITPLAY A CLIP OF "KUMARE."
>> THERE'S NOTHING PHONY ABOUT HIM.
>> KUMAR RAY IS OPEN TOWARDS EVERYTHING IN A NON-JUDGMENTAL WAY.
>> THE MORE STUDENTS I MET AND CLASSES I TAUGHT THE MORE IT SEEMED THE KUMARE MOVEMENT COULD
TAKE HOLD.
>> THE PEOPLE THAT FEEL THAT CONNECTION TOWARDS HIM AND THEY
SEE HIM AND THEY'RE LIKE BRING IT IN, BRING IT IN.
>> Stephen: IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO, YOUR BEARD IS DOING A LOT OF 2 T WORK THERE.
(LAUGHTER) I'D FOLLOW A GUY WITH A BEARD LIKE THAT.
>> THANK YOU.
I JUST SHAVED THIS MORNING.
IT GROWS VERY FAST.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT WERE YOU TEACHING?
>> WELL, I WAS TEACHING A PHILOSOPHY CALL REQUESTED "THE MIRROR" WHICH IS A MADEUP
PHILOSOPHY BUT ISN'T SO NEW.
IT'S BASICALLY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT WE ALL HAVE ANSWERS INSIDE OURSELVES AND WHEN WE LOOK AT
RELIGIOUS LEADERS LIKE KUMARE WE'RE JUST PROJECTING IDEAS ON THEM.
WE WANT TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE OURSELVES.
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO'S LOST AND I SAY
"WHAT IS THE WAY?"
>> AS KUMARE?
>> Stephen: YES.
>> I HAD A DIFFERENTING A TENT?
THE MOVIE.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET A TASTE?
>> IT'S BETTER IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.
(LAUGHTER) (ACCENTED) MY NAME IS KUMARE.
I AM A GREW ARE YOU BUT I ONLY A REFLECTION OF THE GURU INSIDE OF YOU.
>> Stephen: I WILL FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE.
(LAUGHTER) SO HOW DID YOU GET STARTED?
BECAUSE A GURU HAS TO HAVE FOLLOWERS, RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T PUT AN AD ON CRAIGSLIST, RIGHT?
GURU LOOKING FOR FOLLOWERS.
>> I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO.
WE USED THE INTERNET.
WE MADE A WEB SITE,
Www.kumare.org.
>> Stephen: DID YOU OPEN AN ASH RAM?
>> WE USE A HOUSE AS A BEST OF OUR OPERATION BUT WE SAID THERE'S A GURU IN TOWN, MY
PRODUCERS TOLD PEOPLE WE WERE MAKING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A GURU AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANTED
TO MEET A SPIRITUAL LEADER GOT TO MEET ONE.
>> Stephen: AND THEY BELIEVED YOU!
>> PEOPLE BELIEVED ME, YES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU BLAME THEM FOR BELIEVING YOU?
LIKE, ARE THEY FOOLS FOR BELIEVING YOU OR ARE THEY JUST LOST?
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING FOOLISH OR LOST ABOUT
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS I JUST THINK KUMARE WAS SAYING YOU DON'T NEED HIM.
SO IN A WAY I BELIEVE KUMARE BECAUSE HE BELIEVES EVERYTHING I BELIEVE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHERE THERE MORE WOMEN OR MEN WHO FOLLOWED YOU?
>> IT WAS MORE WOMEN.
>> Stephen: DID YOU GET CRAZY TAIL?
(LAUGHTER) DID YOU GET CRAZY...
>> THE RULES OF A SPIRITUAL LEADER ARE STRICTER THAN THE RULES FOR A REAL SPIRITUAL LEADER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AT PEAK KUMARE, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
>> I WAS TRYING TO GET 12 DISCIPLES.
I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A NICE ELEGANCE TO THAT.
>> Stephen: IT'S CERTAINLY PLAGIARISM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THERE'S NOTHING NEW, I KNOW.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING JESUS WAS A HOAX?
ARE YOU SAYING HE WAS A TRICKSTER?
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT, I'M NOT DISAGREEING.
WE WANTED TO GET 12 DISCIPLES AND WE ENDED UP WITH AROUND 14.
IT WASN'T ABOUT AMASSING PEOPLE,
IT WAS TEACHING SOMETHING AND LOOKING INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES.
WE FOCUSED ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE FELT WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS MESSAGE AND IT'S TRICKY TO MAKE
A MOVIE WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE FILM GET THE MESSAGE OF THE FILM AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS CONFUSING.
IRONY IS TRICKY WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.
>> HOW ABOUT AT THE END WHEN YOU TOLD THEM?
WERE PEOPLE ANGRY?
>> MIXED REACTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THAT'S A GENTLE WAY OF SAYING THEY WERE SUPER PISSED AT YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE MA MAJORITY OF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU TELL THEM DID YOU SAY "YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN WALKING THE EIGHT HOLE PATH SUCKERS, YOU'VE BEEN PUNKED!" (LAUGHTER)
>> I JUST TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH AT THE END.
>> Stephen: DO YOU MISS KUMARE?
>> I MISS HIM A LOT.
>> Stephen: WILL THERE BE A SECOND COMING OF KUMARE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> POSSIBLY A SECOND OR THIRD,
YES.
>> Stephen: DEPENDING ON BOX OFFICE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> DEPENDING ON FOR... YOU KNOW,
POOH T PEOPLE WANT TO SEE KUMARE AGAIN, HE WOULD RISE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF LIKE TINKER BELL WE ALL CLAPPED FOR KUMARE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: VIKRAM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
VIKRAM GANDHI "KUMARE" IN THEATERS NOW.
