>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,BUT I FOR ONE CANNOT WAIT FOR
THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONSBECAUSE THE POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES ARE AN EMBARRASSMENTOF RICHES, AS OPPOSED TO 2012'S
CANDIDATE, A RICH EMBARRASSMENT.AND I'M ESPECIALLY
INTRIGUED BY FLORIDA SENATOR ANDA MAN LEGALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE
PRESIDENT, MARCO RUBIO.
OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TOREPUBLICANS, THE MEDIA ASK-STAPO
IS ALWAYS PLAYING YOU ITS GOTCHAGAMES.
BUT RUBIO IS NO RUBE E-O.
>> YOUNG VOTERS HAVE ASKED MEAND THEY'RE CURIOUS TO KNOW.
HAVE YOU EVER SMOKED MARIJUANA?
>> YOU KNOW WHY I NEVER ANSWERTHAT QUESTION? I'LL TELL YOU WHY
I NEVER ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
IF I TELL YOU I HAVEN'T, YOUWON'T BELIEVE ME.
>> Stephen:  YEAH, NOBODYWOULD EVER BELIEVE THIS GUY'S
NOT A STONER.
I MEAN WE ALL SAW HIS NATIONALLYTELEVISED EPIC CASE OF COTTON
MOUTH.
BUT, RUBIO CAN'T ADMIT THAT HE'SBURNED DOWN.
HE'S TRYING TO WIN OVERREPUBLICANS, THE PARTY THAT
BROUGHT US "JUST SAY NO," FIRSTAS A DRUG POLICY, THEN AS THEIR
ENTIRE PLATFORM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THAT'S WHY HE IS ALWAYS READY TONOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
>> IF I TELL YOU THAT I HAVEN'T,YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.
AND IF I TELL YOU THAT I DID,THEN KIDS WILL LOOK UP TO ME AND
SAY I CAN SMOKE MARIJUANABECAUSE LOOK HOW HE MADE IT.
>> Stephen:  YEAH, THINK OFTHE MESSAGE THAT WOULD SEND ALL
THE TEEN GIRLS STARING UP AT HISPOSTER ON THEIR BEDROOM WALLS
BECAUSE RUBIO'S YOUTH APPEAL,WHICH IS WIDE, HAS HAD NEGATIVE
CONSEQUENCES BEFORE.
>> WHEN I WROTE MY BOOK"AMERICAN SON," I HAD A SEGMENT
IN THE BOOK ABOUT HOW I WASN'T AVERY GOOD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.
I HAD A 2.1 GPA, I GOOFED AROUNDIN CLASS. SO ONE DAY
SOMEBODY SAID I ENJOYEDYOUR BOOK BUT MY SON CAME UP TO
ME AND SAID HE DOESN'T HAVE TOGET GOOD GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL
BECAUSE LOOK AT MARCO RUBIO.
HE DIDN'T DO WELL IN HIGH SCHOOLAND LOOK HOW SUCCESSFUL HE HAS
BEEN.
>> Stephen:  SEE, KIDS MIGHTLOOK AT RUBIO'S SUCCESS AND SAY
MAYBE I CAN SAVE MONEY BYCUTTING MY OWN HAIR, TOO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THE POINT IS-- THE POINT IS HEIS NOT GOING TO MISUSE HIS
STATUS AS A YOUTH ICON TO HOOKKIDS ON DRUGS.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OFWHETHER HE'S EVER SMOKED POT,
RUBIO'S OFFICIAL POSITION IS HEWOULD LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT.
AND THAT IS A MESSAGE OF HOPETHAT IS RESONATING WITH KIDS ALL
OVER AMERICA, LIKE THE YOUNG MANI MENTOR, DAVID.
DAVID, COME ON OUT HERE.
DAVID, EVERYBODY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
DAVID, THANKS SO MUCH.
HAVE A SEAT THERE, DAVID.
DAVID IS A GOOD KID.
DAVID IS PART OF MY URBANOUTREACH PROGRAM.
( LAUGHTER )WHERE I REACH OUT OF THE URBAN
AREAS INTO SOME WEALTHIERSUBURBS.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, DAVID.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  DAVID, YOU'RE AHUGE MARCO RUBIO FAN, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S SOSUCCESSFUL.
DID YOU KNOW MY MAN RUBE DOGHELPED DROP THE SENATE
IMMIGRATION BILL BEFORE BACKINGAWAY FROM IT ULTIMATELY VOTING
FOR IT ONLY TO SEE IT GO NOWHEREIN THE HOUSE.
HE'S THE MAN!
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  OKAY, OKAY, BUT,DAVID, DO YOU SLACK OFF IN
SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU HEARD SENATORRUBIO DID?
>> STEPHEN, LET ME TELL YOU WHYI NEVER ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
IF I SAID I'M NOT SLACKING OFF,YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.
AND IF I DID SAY I AM SLACKINGOFF I'D BE SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE
FOR ALL THE MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDSWHO LOOK UP TO ME BECAUSE I'M IN
HIGH SCHOOL.
>> Stephen:  OH-- OH-- OKAY.
SO ARE YOU NOT ANSWERING MYQUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE
INFLUENCED BY MARCO RUBIO'S NOTANSWERING QUESTIONS?
>> LET ME YOU WHY I'M NOT GOINGTO ANSWER THAT QUESTION,
STEPHEN.
IF I TELL YOU -->> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH, DAVID.
JUST ANSWER THIS MUCH-- DO YOU,A YOUNG PERSON WHO WILL BE ABLE
TO VOTE IN 2016, THINK MARCORUBIO COULD BE ELECTED
PRESIDENT?
