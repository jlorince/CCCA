(APPLAUSE) BUT, FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILLARD, WHAT I LOVED MOST WAS THE HEARTWARMING PANT
CRAPPING OVER AT MSNBC.
>> I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRESIDENT.
I THOUGHT HE WAS OFF HIS GAME.
I WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNED TONIGHT.
>> THERE WASN'T, I DON'T THINK, A SINGLE DIRECT ATTACK AGAINST MR. ROMNEY FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
NO DISCUSSION OF THE 47%.
>> AT ALL.
>> NO DISCUSSION OF IMMIGRATION.
NO DISCUSSION OF UNION RIGHTS.
NO DISCUSSION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, NO DISCUSSION OF BAIN.
>> WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT?
>> Stephen: OH, BREAK OUT THE SOUR CREAM AND BACON BITS, NATION, BECAUSE MR. POTATO HEAD IS STEAMED!
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO YOU KNOW WHY, I JUST GOT TO GET ANOTHER TASTE OF CHRIS MATTHEWS HERE.
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT LET ME JUST-- I WANT TO JACK IN RIGHT HERE OKAY, JACK INTO HIM RIGHT THERE, SO I CAN
FEAST ON HIS IMPOTENT RAGE.
>> TONIGHT WASN'T AN MSNBC DEBATE WAS IT?
IT JUST WASN'T.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS DOING OUT THERE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LET ROMNEY GET AWAY IT WITH IT.
THEY ARE PART OF YOUR 47%.
YOU WANT TO-- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHANCE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT!
HE SHOULD WATCH -- -- WITH WAS ROMNEY DOING, WINNING.
OBAMA SHOULD WATCH MSNBC.
>> Stephen: I'LL VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT MOVES!
