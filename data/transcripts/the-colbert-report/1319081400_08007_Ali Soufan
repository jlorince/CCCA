MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EXPERT ON
GETTING INFORMATION FROM
TERRORISTS.
I'M GOING TO HAVE HIM CALL TIME
WARNER CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ME.
PLEASE WELCOME ALI SOUFAN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. SOUFAN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
NOW, MANY PEOPLE HERE MAY NOT
KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT THEY
REALLY SHOULD BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
QUITE THE IMPRESSIVE CV.
YOU'RE A FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
FOR THE F.B.I.
YOU SERVED ON THE FRONT LINES
AGAINST AL QAEDA AS AN
INTERROGATOR AND A COUNTER
TERRORISM OPERATOR.
AND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED
"THE BLACK BANNERS: THE INSIDE
STORY OF 9/11 AND THE WAR
AGAINST AL QAEDA."
WHAT'S A BLACK BANNER?
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT AL
QAEDA BELIEVE THEY ARE.
THE BLACK BANNER IS A SAYING
FROM THE PROPHET OF ISLAM,
PROPHET MUHAMMED.
>> STEPHEN: I KNOW WHO THAT
IS.
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD GUY, YEAH.
>> IT SAYS THAT THE BLACK
BANNERS WILL COME AT THE END OF
TIME FOR THE FINAL BATTLE OF
ARMAGEDDON, AND BIN LADEN MADE A
LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO JOINED
HIM IN AL QAEDA BELIEVE THAT
THEY ARE PART OF THIS BLACK
BANNER MYTH THAT'S GOING TO COME
TOWARDS THE END OF TIME.
>> STEPHEN: SO IT'S AN
APOCALYPTIC VISION.
>> WELL, IT JUST GIVES US HOW
LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT AL QAEDA AS
AN ORGANIZATION AFTER ALL THESE
YEARS FIGHTING IT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ACTUALLY FOUND
OUT A FAIR BIT ABOUT AL QAEDA
FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF THE
UNITED STATES.
YOU GOT BIN LADEN'S BODYGUARD TO
IDENTIFY THE SEPTEMBER 11TH
HIJACKERS.
YOU GOT ABU ZUBADA TO FINGER THE
9/11 MASTERMIND, AND YOU
UNEARTHED JOSE PADILLA'S PLAN TO
USE A DIRTY BOMB.
CAN I ASSUME ALL OF THAT IS
WATERBOARDING?
BECAUSE THAT ENHANCED
INTERROGATION IS WHAT GOT US THE
TIPS WE NEEDED TO FIGHT AL
QAEDA.
>> ACTUALLY, NONE OF THIS, AS
YOU MENTIONED, IS BECAUSE OF
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES OR
WATERBOARDING.
FOR EXAMPLE, ABU ZUBADIA, THE
FIRST QUESTION, I ASKED HIM HIS
NAME.
HE GAVE ME A WRONG ALIAS, SO I
LOOKED AT HIM IN THE FACE, AND I
SAID, "WHAT I IF I CALL YOU
HANI?"
THAT WAS THE NAME HIS MOTHER
NICKNAMED HIM AS A CHILD.
HE HAD THAT LOOK, OH, MY GOSH,
HE GOT ME.
HE STARTED TALKING AND GAVE
ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE IN THE
FIRST HOUR OF OUR INTERROGATION.
>> STEPHEN: BUT IT WASN'T
ENOUGH BECAUSE THEY EVENTUALLY
BROUGHT IN AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR
WHO WATER BOARDED HIM 83 TIMES.
>> EXACTLY.
>> STEPHEN: SO IF YOU WERE
GETTING GOOD INFORMATION, THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN HIM THE FREE
SWIMMING LESSONS.
>> RIGHT.
RIGHT.
THE 83 WATERBOARDING SESSIONS IS
JUST A PERFECT EXAMPLE HOW THESE
TECHNIQUES DON'T WORK BECAUSE...
>> STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> IF IT WORKED YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO DO 83 WITH HIM.
I WAS THERE WITH KHALID SHEIKH
MOHAMED.
THESE ENHANCED INTERROGATION
TECHNIQUES THAT CONCLUDE WITH
WATERBOARDING, AS APPALLING AS
THEY ARE TO PEOPLE IN THE WEST,
IT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT
THEY ARE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE IF
THEY ARE CAUGHT IN SOME EASTERN
JAIL, FOR EXAMPLE.
>> STEPHEN: RIGHT, SO WE'RE
STILL THE GOOD GUYS FOR DOING
IT.
LET'S BE CLEAR, YOU DON'T HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH WATERBOARDING?
>> I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
WATERBOARDING BECAUSE I DON'T
BELIEVE IT'S EFFECTIVE.
LET ME TELL YOU HOW
INTERROGATIONS WORK, FOR
EXAMPLE.
>> STEPHEN: I KNOW HOW THAT
WORKS.
GOOD COP, BAD COP, RIGHT?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: BAD COP WATER
BOARDS, GOOD COP CARRIES THE
TOWEL.
>> NO.
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I WAS ON THE
FRONT LINE?
>> STEPHEN: I WAS ON THE FRONT
LINE HERE, MY FRIEND, EVERY
NIGHT.
SO HOW DO THEY WORK?
HOW DO YOU BELIEVE...
>> YOU OUTSMART THE INDIVIDUAL.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION
ALREADY UNDER YOUR FINGERTIPS ON
THAT PERSON, ON THE
ORGANIZATION.
YOU TRY TO OUTWIT THEM INTO
KNOWING YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS
ABOUT THEM.
FOR EXAMPLE, BIN LADEN'S
PERSONAL BODYGUARD HAD NO IDEA
WHO WERE THE HIJACKERS.
WE ONLY KNEW THAT HE KNEW ONE OF
THE HIJACKERS.
AFTER WE MADE HIM BELIEVE THAT
THAT HIJACKER MAY BE A SOURCE TO
US AND HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT HIM,
HE STARTED IDENTIFYING EVERYONE
ELSE, AND THIS IS HOW WE KNEW
THAT SEVEN OUT OF THE HIJACKERS
WERE AL QAEDA OPERATIVES AND WE
HAD ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE
NEEDED AT THE TIME THAT AL QAEDA
WAS BEHIND 9/11.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
SO YOU SAY YOU DON'T NEED TO USE
WATERBOARDING FOR ANY OF, THAT
BUT VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY SAID
THAT ENHANCED INTERROGATION,
LIKE WATERBOARDING, IS HOW WE
GOT THIS INFORMATION.
ARE YOU SAYING HE'S NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH?
>> WELL, I AM SAYING THAT I WAS
THERE AND HE WASN'T, AND I AM
SAYING...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IF YOU ARE SAYING...
>> GO AHEAD, NO, GO AHEAD.
>> I AM SAYING I'M THE ONLY ONE
SO FAR IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
WHO GAVE A STATEMENT UNDER OATH
ABOUT THE ALLEGED EFFICACY OF
ENHANCED INTERGATION TECHNIQUES.
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO RAISE
THEIR RIGHT HAND AND TAKE THAT
OATH AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS,
THEN WE CAN TALK.
>> Stephen: IF YOU'RE SAYING
THESE PEOPLE WON'T RAISE THEIR
RIGHT HAND AND TAKE THE OATH,
YOU'RE SAYING THESE PEOPLE ARE
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT DICK CHENEY
IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.
AND I KNOW THE ONLY WAY THE GET
THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM.
WATER BOARD THE GUY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> I BELIEVE THERE'S MANY OTHER
WAYS.
>> STEPHEN: NO.
LET'S TALK ACTED AL QAEDA NOW.
WE'RE TAKING THESE GUYS OUT LEFT
AND RIGHT.
WE JUST TOOK OUT AL-AWLAKI WITH
A DRONE OVER YEMEN.
ARE YOU DOWN WITH THAT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: I'M DOWN WITH IT.
EN I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE DOWN WITH IT.
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WITHOUT A
TRIAL GETS BLOWN UP OVER IN
YEMEN BECAUSE HE'S ON THE KILL
OR CAPTURE LIST.
>> STEPHEN, I DON'T LIKE TO
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST TERRORISTS
BASED ON NATIONALITY.
IF YOU DECLARE WAR ON THE UNITED
STATES AND YOU WANT THE KILL US,
WE'RE GOING TO KILL YOU FIRST.
PERIOD.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I LIKE THESE
PEOPLE.
HOW DO YOU GET... IF YOU'RE ON
THE KILL OR CAPTURE LIST,HOW DO
YOU GET OFF?
AND I'M JUST ASKING FOR A
FRIEND.
>> I THINK ONE DAY YOU WILL BE
SITTING IN A CAVE OR IN A ROOM
OR IN A SMALL LITTLE MUD HOUSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRIBAL AREA
AND A DRONE COMES AND TAKES YOU
OFF THE LIST.
>> STEPHEN: SO THERE'S ONLY
REALLY ONE EXIT?
>> IT'S LIKE HOTEL CALIFORNIA.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
ALI SOUFAN.
THE BOOK IS "THE BLACK BANNERS."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
