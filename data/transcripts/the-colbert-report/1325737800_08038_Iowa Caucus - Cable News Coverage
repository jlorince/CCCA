PRINCESS BUTTERCUP.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, LAST NIGHT WAS
A MARATHON FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN
CABLE NEWS.
FORTUNATELY THEY WERE UP TO THE
CHALLENGE.
ESPECIALLY MY FRIENDS OVER AT
THE FOX NEWS TEAM, LED BY HUNKY
QUARTERBACK BRETT BAIER AND
BEAUTIFUL BIRD OF PREY MEGYN
KELLY.
>> IT IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL RIGHT
NOW AT THIS MOMENT.
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON SOME
VOTES.
ACTUALLY FROM STORY COUNTY.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT IS
TAKING SO LONG.
>> WE'RE NOW IN HOUR FIVE, JUST
FOR THOSE OF YOU COUNTING AT
HOME, HOUR FIVE AND STILL NO
WINNER AND NO EXPLANATION FOR
WHY THERE ISN'T A WINNER.
>> WE'RE GETTING INTO THE WEE
HOURS OF THE MORNING, AND IT'S
OBVIOUS THAT THEY DON'T SEEM TO
HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THESE
BALLOTS ARE.
>> HOW WILL THIS GO AND HOW LONG
WILL THIS GO?
AND WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THE
FACT THAT IT'S STILL GOING?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: BUT DEATH WOULD
NOT COME, SO THEY SOLDIERED ON
DESPITE THE LOSS OF BASIC MENTAL
FUNCTIONS.
>> LOOK HOW CLOSE IT IS.
RICK SANTORUM NOW IN SECOND
PLACE ONLY BY A FEW... LET'S
SEE... ABOUT 60 VOTES.
NO, NO, NO, ABOUT 100 VOTES.
>> THE TOP TWO BATTLING IT OUT,
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS... AGAIN
WITH THE PATH.
>> I THINK IT'S ONLY 13 VOTES.
>> OKAY.
SO JUST TO MAKE CLEAR, AS WE
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS HERE, 28,
201 MINUS 28...
>> REALLY?
REALLY?
>> OKAY.
I DID IT WRONG.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S GO TO
BREAK.
>> FOX WERE NOT MY ONLY
COLLEAGUES SLOGGING THROUGH THE
CAUCUS SWAMP.
CNN DEBUTED THEIR NEW FLICK
TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ALLOWED THEM
TO THROW CHARTS AT EACH OTHER
ACROSS THE STUDIO WHEN IT WASN'T
CONFOUNDING ERIN BURNETT.
>> BEFORE I SEND IT BACK TO YOU
ANSELMISON, WE'LL DO A REVERSE
FLICK.
>> OH.
>> OH, NO.
>> ARE YOU READY?
>> YES, YES.
VERY GOOD.
>> THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM.
EXCELLENT FLICKING GOING ON.
>> Stephen: ERIN, YOU CLEARLY
NEED A LESSON IN ADVANCED
FLICKOLOGY, SO JOIN ME NOW AT
"THE COLBERT REPORT"
FLICTRONIC-TRON 5600.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[SIREN BLARES]
WELCOME TO THE FLICTRONIC-TRON
5600, WHERE THE NEWS WILL NOT
STAY IN ONE PLACE.

NOW, LET'S BRING UP ERIN
BURNETT'S LOVELY PHOTO AND
FLICK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[FLUSHING]
>> Stephen: WHERE DID SHE GO?
WHERE DID SHE GO?
WHERE IS ERIN NOW, YOU ASK?
LET'S SEE.
I'M SENSING A PRESENCE
SOMEWHERE, SOMEWHERE IN THE...
IT'S IN THIS AREA.
YOUNG LADY, HOLE STILL.

THANK YOU.
