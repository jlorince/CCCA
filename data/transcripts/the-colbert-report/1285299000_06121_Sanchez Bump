NATION, PLEASE BE SEATED.
NATION, FROM FIRST DAY I WENT ON
THE AIR, I'VE MADE IT MY DUTY TO
TELL YOU WHAT TO BE AFRAID OF --
IMMIGRANTS, MUSLIMS, ROBOTS,
GAYS, BEARS, AND GAY BEARS.
[LAUGHTER]
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, GAYS, I
KNOW ALL YOURLING YORK AND, YES,
I ALSO LINGO IS A TERM FOR AN
AUSTRALIAN LESBIAN.
DIDN'T KNOW, THAT DID YOU?
WELL, NOW THERE'S A NEW FEAR,
JON STEWART'S RALLY TO RESTORE
SANITY HAS MORE FACEBOOK
R.S.V.P.s THAN MY MARCH TO
KEEP FEAR ALIVE.
YEAH, OOH.
AS OF THIS TAPING I'VE GOT
55,034.
AND JON'S GOT 131,176.
AND I'M SURE, I AM SURE THERE'S
NOTHING TO THE RUMOR THAT
EVERYONE WHO R.S.V.P.ED TO JON'S
RALLY WERE TAKEN OTHER BY ALIEN
POD PEOPLE.
MUSLIM ALIEN POD PEOPLE.
THEY CAME HERE ON THEIR ROCKET
SHIP MINARETS AND THEIR FLYING
CARPET, WHICH WERE QUITE
TASTEFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE GAY
MUSLIM ALIEN POD PEOPLE.
TO POINT IS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
GIVING JON STEWART THE LOVE, AND
HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T HESITATE TO
GLOAT ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: A CERTAIN OPRAH
WINFREY TWEETED TODAY, "I THINK
JON STEWART'S ON TO SOMETHING.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER GOING TO HIS
RALLY, OCTOBER 30, 2010.
" STEVEN, I KNOW MY RALLY IS
ABOUT BEING SANE AND HAVING A
CIVILIZED DISCOURSE, SO IN HONOR
OF THE TYPE OF DISCOURSE, I
THINK WE NEED TO PROPOSE, I
WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THIS:
SUCK IT, COLBERT!
OPRAH MENTIONED MY RALLY, NOT
YOURS!
♪ OPRAH MENTIONED MY RALLY
OPRAH MENTIONED MY RALLY

OPRAH TWEETED ABOUT YOU.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT I GOT A
TWEET FROM GAIL.
AND GUESS WHAT?
GUESS WHAT, JON?
I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT
I'VE GOTTEN MY OWN ENDORSEMENT
FROM A MAJOR MEDIA FIGURE, TOO.
SO EXCITED.
WHO COULD IT BE?
JIMMY.
>> KEEP FEAR ALIVE.
>> YEAH, KEEP FEAR ALIVE.
>> LET'S START IGNORING THE
OTHER GUY, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO
SAY HIS NAME, AND GIVE ALL THE
EMPHASIS TO STEVEN COLBERT,
BECAUSE HE'S A TRUE AMERICAN.
WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO TALK
ABOUT THE OTHER GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WOW.
RICK SANCHEZ.
THE COVETED SANCHEZ BUMP.

SUPPORTERS.
[LAUGHTER]
TAKE THAT... JON.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JIMMY, GIVE ME A
LITTLE TASTE OF THIS CRACKER
JACK, NIMBLE NEWSMAN.
>> UP NEXT, AD-LIB A TEASE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO AD-LIB SOMETHING
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S LIKE I'M A FRESHMAN AND
I'VE JUST BEEN BEFRIENDED BY A
LOSER UPPER CLASSMAN, NOW I HAVE
TO EAT LUNCH WITH HIM THE WHOLE
YEAR.
SNAP OUT OF IT, COLBERT, SNAP
OUT OF IT.
LOOK AT IT POSITIVELY, RICK
SANCHEZ IS KIND OF LIKE OPRAH
FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE WATCH
RICK SANCHEZ GETTING TASED.
RIGHT, RICK?
