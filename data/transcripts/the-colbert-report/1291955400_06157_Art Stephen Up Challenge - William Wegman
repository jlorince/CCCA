>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS YOU
KNOW, IN THE WAKE OF LAST
NIGHT'S SPECIAL ART-THEMED SHOW,
I AM NOW A HUGE PLAYER IN THE
ART WORLD.
AND TO THINK JUST A DAY AGO I
COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT ART.
BUT NOW I GET ART.
SPECIFICALLY THE PART OF IT THAT
MAKES MONEY.
( LAUGHTER )
AND AS A NEWLY MINTED ART SCENE
KING MAKER, I WANT TO THANK ALL
THE ARTISTS WHO STOPPED BY,
STEVE MARTIN, FRANK STELLA,
SHEPARD FAIREY AND
ANDRES SERRANO.
WHILE LAST NIGHT'S SHOW WAS VERY
ARTSY, WE HAD TO CUT OUT SOME OF
THE FARTSY.
WE HAD TO CALL -- CUT THIS.
>> IT'S CALLED EJACULATE
INJECTION 14.
>> MY EJACULATES WERE...
>> Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR
LONGEST SHOT?
TO BE FAIR, I ASK THAT QUESTION
OF ALL MY GUESTS.
MY APOLOGIES TO DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN.
YOU CAN VIEW THE FULL 13
UNCIRCUMCISED MINUTES ON
COLBERTNATION.COM.
LAST NIGHT THESE WORLD-CLASS
ARTISTS GOT SOME OF THEIR ART ON
MY PORTRAIT, REALLY ART IT UP.
IF THERE ARE ANY BIG-TIME
ARTISTS OUT THERE WHO WANT TO
FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEP, WE'VE
MADE A CLEAN FULL RESOLUTION
DOWNLOAD OF MY PORTRAIT
AVAILABLE AT COLBERTNATION.COM
FOR ANYONE TO ADD THEIR ARTISTIC
INTERPRETATION TO ME.
SO HAVE AT YOU, INTERNATIONALLY
RENOWNED NATION.
IF I LIKE IT, YOUR PORTRAIT WILL
APPEAR OVER MY FIREPLACE.
IF I DON'T LIKE IT, IT WILL
APPEAR IN MY FIREPLACE.
( LAUGHTER )
AND TO KICK OFF THE COLBERT ART
ME UP CHALLENGE, HERE'S THE
FIRST ENTRY FROM A FAMOUS ART
GUY.
>> I'M ARTIST WILLIAM WEGMAN, AN
I'M KNOWN FOR MY PORTRAITS OF MY
DOG, MY YMCA RANKERS.
SO STEPHEN, IS YOUR PORTRAIT
ART?
I WOULDN'T HANG IT ON MY WALL.
I'VE COME UP WITH A FEW IDEAS
THAT I THINK WE CAN TRY TO PUT
MORE ART ON THE PORTRAIT.
SO HERE GOES.
I THINK THE FROM THE OF THE COAT
NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.
I THINK WE GOT IT.
EVERYONE AGREE?
ALL RIGHT.
GET OUT OF HERE.
I GOT TO GO WALK MY DOGS.
( APPLAUSE )
>> I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EVER
