MOVING ON.
BUT BEFORE WE GET TOO USED
TO THE TERM PRESIDENT
SANTORUM, I'VE GOT TO WARN
YOU FOLKS, THAT THERE IS A
SLIM CHANCE THAT HE MAY NOT
WIN.
YOU SEE BARACK OBAMA SAY
PRETTY GOOD CAMPAIGNER, WHO
WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO
BECOME OUR FIRST EVER SECOND
BLACK PRESIDENT.
HE IS ALREADY SET IN MOTION
A DIABOLICAL PLOT TO HOLD
OFFICE AND IT BRINGS US
TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, RIGHT NOW
THE CAMPAIGN IS FOCUSED ON
THE ECONOMY.
BUT WE'RE STILL AT WAR AND
WHOEVER IS THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO NEED EVERY TOOL AT
HIS DISPOSAL TO
DISRUPT-- DISRUPT, DEFEAT
AND DISMANTLE THE TERRORISTS
WHO SEEK TO-- THAT IS WHY I
HAVE ROOTED FOR THE PASSAGE
OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT.
THE NBAA.
IN ADDITION TO FUNDING OUR
WARS, THEY STRIKE AT THE
HEART OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS
SAFE HAVEN FOR TERRORISTS.
IT STRIKES AT THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION.
IN WHICH OUR FOUNDERS
NAIVELY GUARANTEED THE RIGHT
OF HABEAS CORPUS AND TRIAL
BY JURY.
BUT FOLKS, BY ENSCHRYNEING
OUR LIBERTIES, THAT IS NO
WAY TO PRESERVE THEM.
THANKFULLY THIS BILL
DOESN'T.
>> UNDER THE ACT THE
GOVERNMENT MAY DETAIN
WITHOUT TRIAL SUSPECTED
MEMBERS OF AL QAEDA OR ITS
ALLIES.
>> Stephen: IN OTHER WORDS, --
>> IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WE
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR
TEN YEARS BUT WITH THE
UNEXPECTED TWIST OF IT TO
YOU BEING LEGAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WE DIDN'T SEE
THAT COMING.
NOW OF COURSE, OF COURSE
THIS UP SET THE AL-CODDLERS
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.
>> INDEFINITE MILITARY
DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL OF
AMERICAN CITIZENS IS
CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE.
>> YOU CANNOT HAVE THE
PRESIDENT POWER TO ARREST
AMERICAN CITIZENS IN THEIR
OWN COUNTRY WITHOUT THE
RATIONAL OF DUE PROCESS.
>> IT TAKES A WRECKING BALL
TO THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION.
THIS LEGISLATION AUTHORIZES
THE MILITARY TO INDEFINITELY
DETAIN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT
CHARGE OR TRIAL, INCLUDING
THE DETENTION OF U.S.
CITIZENS ON U.S. SOIL.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT'S
RIDICULOUS.
WE WILL NOT LOCK UP
AMERICANS INDEFINITELY.
EVENTUALLY THEY WILL DIE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT TO PLACATE
THE HABBUOUS HUGGERS, AN
AMENDMENT WAS ADDED STATING
NOTHING IN THIS SECTION
SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO AFFECT
EXISTING LAW.
THAT THEN MADE THE BILL
ACCEPTABLE.
IN THE SAME WAY IT'S
ACCEPTABLE TO SAY YOUR
MOTHER IS A WHORE AS LONG AS
YOU ADD AN AMENDMENT SAYING,
IF SHE IS NOT, DISREGARD THE
PREVIOUS STATEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, OF
COURSE NO ONE CAME OUT
HARDER AGAINST THIS BILL
THAN BARACK OBAMA WHO VOWED
TO VETO IT.
FORTUNATELY PRESIDENT OBAMA
WAS SMACK DOWN BY A MAN WITH
SOME BALLS.
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OBAMA WHO
SIGNED THE NDAA INTO LAW ON
DECEMBER 31st.
HAPPY NEW YEAR.
NOW HE KNEW THAT BY DOING
THIS HIS VOTERS WOULDN'T
LIKE IT.
SO THE PRESIDENT ADDED A
SIGNING STATEMENT THAT SAID
I HAVE SIGNED THIS BILL
DESPITE HAVING SERIOUS
RESERVATIONS.
HE SIGNED IT BUT SAID IT WAS
WRONG.
THAT IS CALLED STANDING ON
YOUR PRINCIPLESES.
BUT THE REAL STROKE OF
GENIUS HERE WAS WHEN HE
ADDED, QUOTE, MY
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT
AUTHORIZE THE INDEFINITE
MILITARY DETENTION WITHOUT
TRIAL OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.
NOTICE HOW HE SAID "MY ADD."
THE PRESIDENT CAN NOW HAVE
YOU SNATCHED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT AND WHISKED OFF
TO BE TORTURED IN THE
BASEMENT OF SOME LITH JANIAN
JANIAN-- LITHUANIAN DISCO.
BUT, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT,
BARACK OBAMA IS SAYING THAT
WON'T HAPPEN TO YOU AS LONG
AS BARACK OBAMA IS PRESIDENT.
NOW IT IS CLEAR WHAT HIS
MESSAGE IS TO VOTERS.
HE'S SAYING HEY, YOU'RE SAFE
WITH ME.
BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE THE
NEXT GUY ISN'T GOING TO
DISAPPEAR YOUR SON AND HOOK
HIS NIPPLES UP TO A TRUCK
BATTERY.
OR, AS HE USED TO SAY, HOPE.
BUT WITH THE ECONOMY WHERE
IT IS, FOLKS, HE'S GOING TO
HAVE TO GO EVEN FURTHER.
I THINK NEXT HE SHOULD
INTRODUCE, SIGN AND THEN
OPPOSE A LAW GRANTING HIM
THE COMMAND NEVER CHIEF
PRIMA NUCTI, THE RIGHT TO
DEFLOWER ANY MAN'S WIFE ON
THEIR WEDDING NIGHT.
NOW OF COURSE, PRESIDENT
OBAMA WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
BUT PRESIDENT GINGRICH?
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE
THAT CHANCE?
OR TO MAKE SURE HE NEVER HAS
TO LEAVE OFFICE, OBAMA COULD
SIMPLY SIGN THE LAW ALLOWING
EX-PRESIDENTS TO HUNT
AMERICANS FOR SPORT.
UP UNTIL NOW THAT WAS ONLY
LEGAL FOR VICE PRESIDENTS.
SO--
(APPLAUSE)
I MISS THAT GOOD MAN.
SO IF YOU'RE UP SET BECAUSE
YOU VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA
THINKING HE WOULD BE BETTER
THAN GEORGE BUSH ON
INDEFINITE DETENTION, YOU
BETTER VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN.
NOT BECAUSE HE'S BETTER BUT
BECAUSE HE JUST RELUCTANTLY
MADE IT EASIER FOR THE NEXT
PRESIDENT TO BE JUST
