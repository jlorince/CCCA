( LAUGHTER )WHICHEVER ADOLF HITLER YOUR
YOUNG CHILD IS, WE HAVE NOCHANCE OF STOPPING HIM NOW,
THANKS TO THE GUTTING OF OURARMED FORCES BY SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE CHUCK "HUSSEIN" HAGEL.
>> NEW CONCERNS ABOUT AMERICA'SMILITARY READINESS.
>> THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED TOSLASH AMERICA'S MILITARY,
RAISING MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUTU.S. NATIONAL SECURITY.
>> GROWING OUTRAGE OVER THEADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO CUT
OUR MILITARY TO LEVELS THAT HAVENOT BEEN SEEN SINCE WORLD WAR
II.
>> DEVASTATING CUTS TO OURMILITARY.
COULD THIS MOVE BY THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION NOW PUT YOUR
SECURITY AT RISK?
>> Stephen:  NATION, I AMTERRIFIED.
I HOPE THAT BUDGET INCLUDESFUNDING FOR NEW PANTS BECAUSE
MINE JUST HAD A DISHONORABLEDISCHARGE.
( LAUGHTER )HOW IS AMERICA GOING TO DEFEND
ITSELF AFTER THESE CUTS?
I MEAN, WHAT'S LEFT OF OURBUDGET, ANYTHING?
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERETHAT OUR MILITARY STILL HAS A
BUDGET BIGGER THAN THE NEXT 10MILITARY BUDGETS IN THE WORLD
COMBINED.
>> Stephen:  ONLY 10?
( LAUGHTER )BUT WHAT IF WE WANT TO INVADE 11
COUNTRIES?
( LAUGHTER )OF COURSE WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR
THAT CAPACITY NOW, FOLKS BE,BECAUSE THE CUTS IN THIS BUDGET
ARE EXPLICITLY A REJECTION OFTHE PREVIOUS "FIGHT TWO WARS AT
ONCE" DOCTRINE.
HAGEL HAS EVIDENTLY FORGOTTENTHE HARD LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM
FIGHTING TOJO AND YOUR SON.
HEY, HEY, FOLKS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND, HEY, I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF A
LOWER BUDGET, BUT ISN'T THERESOMETHING ELSE WE CAN CUT?
>> THIS OUR READINESS ANDNATIONAL SECURITY IS ALL BEING
SACRIFICED IF YOU WILL ON THEALTAR OF ENTITLEMENT.
>> THESE ARE THE KIND OF CUTSYOU HAVE TO MAKE WHEN YOU'RE NOT
WILLING TO REIGN INENTITLEMENTS.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNTOF MONEY WE SPEND ON DEFENSE
VERSUS ENTITLEMENTSIT'S AN EYE-OPENER.
AS YOU CAN SEE, BACK IN 1990--JUST FOR POINT OF REFERENCE,
ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO, $300 BILLIONWAS SPENT ON DEFENSE.
AND ABOUT 568 BILLION WAS SPENTON ENTITLEMENTS.
FAST FORWARD TO 2010.
ABOUT $700 BILLION ON THEDEFENSE OF THIS NATION.
WHILE CLOSE TO TRIL-- 2--HUNDRED-- RATHER, ONE-- THAT'S A
HARD NUMBER TO READ RIGHT THERE.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, OKAY, ITHINK I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG HERE.
JIM, PUT THE CHART BACK UP.
THE FIRST YEAR SHOULD READ,"1990, NOT 2008.
DEFENSE SPENDING SHOULD BE BLUEAND ENTITLEIMENTS SHOULD BE RED.
AND STEVE DOOCY SHOULD NOT BE ONTELEVISION.
