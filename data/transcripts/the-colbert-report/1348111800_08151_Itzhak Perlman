I LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC IN ITS PLACE, OKAY, AT THE BACKGROUND -- BACKGROUND AT A NICE RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING TO
CUT AN OLYMPIC MONTAGE TOO BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S PASSION FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC.
WHAT IS IT THAT DREW YOU TO IT?
>> I WAS LISTENING ON THE RADIO TO VIOLINIST AND CLASSICAL PIECES AND ORCHESTRAS AND I LIKE PARTICULARLY THE VIOLINISTS THE
SOUND OF TONE.
>> STEPHEN: HOW OLD ARE WE TALKING HERE?
>> THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO.
THEY BROUGHT ME A SMALL VIOLIN AND IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE I HEARD ON THE RADIO.
I THREW IT AWAY.
WE POST PONIED MY TRAINING TO A YEAR LATER WHEN I COULD ACTUALLY MAKE A SCRATCHY SOUND.
>> STEPHEN: WHEN DID PEOPLE SAY THIS KID HAS GOT IT?
>> ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
YOU ARE A LATE BLOOMER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE MODERN CLASSICAL MUSIC SCENE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE ASIANS, OKAY, HAVE COME OVER HERE AND
TAKEN OUR VIRTUOSO CLASSICAL MUSICAL POSITIONS.
WE INVENTED IT.
WE DON'T GO OVER THERE AND TAKE THEIR PLING PLANG MUSIC.
THERE'S NO THREE-YEAR-OLDS OVER HERE MASTERING THE GONG.
HEY, I'M CALLING IT LIKE I SEE IT.
HOW DEAR THEY TAKE OUR JOBS.
>> ARE WE BEING TAPED NOW.
>> STEPHEN: THIS IS LIVE.
>> I HAVE TO ANSWER TRUTHFULLY.
>> STEPHEN: WHY?
>> IT GOES IN CYCLES.
IT HAS TO DO WITH ROLE MOLDS.
ENOUGH SOMEBODY FROM KOREA OR JAPAN OR CHINA WHO IS WONDERFUL MUSICIAN, THEN YOU SAY I WANT TO BE LIKE HIM.
>> STEPHEN: AFTER THIS.
AFTER THIS PEOPLE ALL OVER AMERICA WILL BE PLAYING THE VIOLIN AFTER YOUR APPEARANCE HERE TONIGHT.
>> I KNOW THAT.
>> STEPHEN: I'M GIVING THE VIOLIN THE COLBERT BUMP RIGHT NOW.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

>> NO, I DON'T WANT TO.
