A LOT LESS ANGRY IF HE GOT SOME
USAIR DOWN THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, EVERY DAY OUR ECONOMY
SINKS FURTHER TO WHAT COULD BE
CALLED A DOUBLE DIP RECESSION.
IT'S GREAT NEWS BECAUSE IT'S
GOING TO BE BLAMED ON BARACK
OBAMA.
>> SUDDENLY BARACK OBAMA LOOKS
MORE VULNERABLE THAN HE DID A
FEW MONTHS AGO.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A ONE TERM
PRESIDENT.
>> THE REPUBLICANS IF THEY PLAY
THIS RIGHT, THEY COULD RUN
LASSIE AND WIN.
>> EVEN LASSIE COULD BEAT OBAMA.
SHE WOULD NEVER GET THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
HELPING TIMMY OUT OF THAT WELL
IS SOCIALISM.
THERE'S STILL A FEW HURDLES TO
CLEAR BEFORE WE GET OUR COUNTRY
BACK FROM THE PEOPLE WE VOTED
FOR.
SEE, OBAMA OWNS THE YOUTH VOTE.
THE ONLY WAY KID KOZLOV HIM MORE
IS IF HE WERE A SKATE PARK.
THE G.O.P. BRAND IS ABOUT AS
POPULAR WITH KIDSES AS AN
EPISODE OF 60 MINUTES HOSTED BY
A TUBE OF SENODYNE.
>> IN THE 2008 CYCLE NONE OF
REPUBLICANS HEAVILY COURTED THE
YOUTH VOTE.
62% OF 18-29-YEAR-OLD VOTED
DEMOCRATIC.
>> WHAT THE REPUBLICANS DON'T
GET IS THAT THE ANTIGAY,
ANTI-IMMIGRANT, ANTI-MUSLIM
STUFF THEY PUT OUT IS TOXIC TO
THE UNDER 35.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
OLD MAN McCAIN WOULD BE
PRESIDENT IF I WASN'T FOR YOU
MEDDLING KIDS.
I DO NOT BUY THE ARGUMENT THAT
YOUNG VOTERS ARE TURNED OFF BY
REPUBLICAN IDEAS.
PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE HAS
DESCRIBED PAUL RYAN MEDICARE
CUTS AS RADICAL.
EVIDENTLY THESE YOUNG HOME BOYS
ARE TOO BUSY DOING THE MACK
RAINA WHILE LISTENING
