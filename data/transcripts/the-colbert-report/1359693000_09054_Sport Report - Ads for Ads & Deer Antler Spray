NATION, WE ARE JUST DAYS AWAY FROM SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PUMPED.
IT'S LIKE FOOTBALL CHRISTMAS, IF CHRISTMAS WERE MORE COMMERCIALIZED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL-- THE SWEET SCIENCE, THE PICK AND ROLL, FROM
DOWNTOWN, YOU SUNK MY BATTLESHIP!
YAHTZEE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M JUST DYING TO SEE THE SAN FRANCISCO-- EARTHQUAKES-- FACE
[ LAUGHTER ]
OFF AGAINST THE BALTIMORE, I WANNA SAY, TRASHCAN FIRES?!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO PUT ON YOUR GAME FACE, THEN SHOVE NACHOS INTO THAT GAME FACE, BECAUSE THIS IS "THE SPORT
REPORT!"

NATION --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- THIS SUNDAY IS ALL ABOUT THE BIG MATCHUP, TWO TITANS OF THE GAME FINALLY GO HEAD TO HEAD.
I'M TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT AXE BODY SPRAY VERSUS THE E-TRADE BABY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE SUPERBOWL ADS ARE MY FAVORITE PART OF THE GAME, AND THIS YEAR THERE'S AN EXCITING
NEW DEVELOPMENT.
>> TEASER ADS THAT TEASE YOU TOWARD THE ADS IN THE BIG GAME.
THIS IS NOW A BRAND NEW PHENOMENON AND IT IS NO JOKE.
THINK OF IT AS ADS FOR THE ADS
>> Stephen: YES, ADS FOR ADS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS GREAT-- TiVO WATCHERS HAVE SOMETHING TO PRACTICE FAST-FORWARDING THROUGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND ME?
I LOVE 'EM!
ESPECIALLY THIS TEASER FOR THE AD FOR TACO BELL.

[ LAUGHTER ]
WOW, SEEING THAT OLD MAN GET HURT REALLY MAKES ME CRAVE SOME MEXICAN FOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR SOME TACO BELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW, EVEN MERCEDES IS GETTING IN ON THE AD-FOR-THE-AD ACTION.
♪ ♪
>> YOU MISSED A SPOT.
♪ ♪
>> Stephen: OOOH, REALLY TARGETS THEIR KEY DEMOGRAPHIC:
[ LAUGHTER ]
14-YEAR-OLD BOYS MAKING 500,000 DOLLARS A YEAR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MUST BE A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT SADLY THE GAME ITSELF IS BEING MARRED BY ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ONE OF THE STAR PLAYERS.
>> BALTIMORE RAVENS LINEBACKER, RAY LEWIS, IS DENYING A SPORTS ILLUSTRATED REPORT THAT CLAIMS
THAT HE USED A BANNED SUBSTANCE WHILE RECOVERING A TORN TRICEP THIS SEASON.
THE ARTICLE CLAIMS LEWIS WAS GIVEN DEER ANTLER SPRAY TO SPEED UP HIS RECOVERY.
>> IT COMES FROM THE VELVET OF DEER ANTLERS.
>> DEER ANTLER SPRAY?
>> Stephen: YES, DEER ANTLER SPRAY, WHICH OF COURSE, WAS BANNED AFTER LANCE ARMSTRONG
BECAME THE FIRST HOOVED WINNER OF THE TOUR DE FRANCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DID NOT KNOW THIS -- EVIDENTLY, DEER ANTLERS CONTAIN "A HORMONE CALLED IGF1 THAT IS
THOUGHT TO HELP MUSCLE RECOVERY." LEWIS HAS STRONGLY DENIED THESE ACCUSATIONS, AND HAS SOME CHOICE
WORDS ABOUT HIS ACCUSER.
>> THE GUY HAS NO CREDIBILITY.
HE'S BEEN SUED FOUR TIMES OVER THE SAME BS.
DON'T LET PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE EVER COME AND TRY TO DISTURB WHAT'S INSIDE.
YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S THE TRICK OF THE DEVIL.
THE TRICK OF THE DEVIL IS TO KILL, STEAL AND DESTROY.
THAT's WHAT HE COMES TO DO.
HE COMES TO DISTRACT YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.
>> Stephen: WELL SAID.
BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO PROVE YOU'RE NOT ON DRUGS IS TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO
MAKE YOU DO THINGS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PERSONALLY, I THINK ALL THE PLAYERS SHOULD TAKE THIS STUFF.
THE NFL HAS A REAL HEAD-INJURY PROBLEM, AND ANTLERS ARE NATURE'S HELMET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IN FACT, ALL FOOTBALL TEAMS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO TAKE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS, AS
LONG AS THEY'RE EXTRACTED FROM THEIR TEAM'S MASCOT.
LET THE CHICAGO PLAYERS INJECT BEAR BILE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET CINCINNATI SNORT TIGER DONG, AND THE WASHINGTON -- WHOA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS ISSUE IS PERSONAL FOR ME.
BECAUSE I TOO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED BY MY RIVALS OF ABUSING DEER ANTLER SPRAY.
THEY WONDER HOW I CAN KEEP THIS UP, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, WITHOUT --
