>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANKS SO.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HEAD OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.
DON'T TELL HER I-- THE SHOW WITH A TIRE FIRE.
PLEASE WELCOME LISA JACKSON.
CHEERS PLAUS THANK YOU SO MUCH, MISS JACKSON.
OKAY.
MA'AM, ARE YOU THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATOR OF THE EPA,
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, I'LL BITE.
ENVIRONMENT.
WHY DO WE NEED IT?
WELL, WE ALREADY HAVE IT.
THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE AIR THAT YOU BREATHE.
>> YEAH.
>> THE WATER THAT YOU DRINK.
>> UH-HUH, I DON'T DRINK A LOT OF WATER.
I DRINK MOSTLY BOLLINGER.
>> THE LAND WHERE YOU LIVE,
WHERE YOUR KID GOES TO SCHOOL, MAYBE WHERE YOU PLAY.
>> YEAH.
>> SO IF IT'S DIRTY F IT'S UNHEALTHY F THE AIR IS FULL
OF POLLUTION YOU CAN'T BE HEALTHY.
>> Stephen: I MEAN, BUT I'VE GOT MY OWN KIND OF ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE MY AUDI
S5 HAS CLIMATE CONTROL.
I GET IN THERE, CLOSED THE WINDOWSnd I CAN CONTROL MY CLIMATE, HEATED SEATS, THE
WHOLE NINE YARDS WHY DO WE COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL OF OUR ENVIRONMENT
IT THAUNDS LIKE WE'RE ALL SHARING THE PLANET.
THAT SOUNDS SOCIALIST.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, WE ARE.
WE ARE SHARING THE PLAN ET CETERA.
AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR AND THE AIR YOU BREATHE IS GOING
TO BE THE SAME AS THE FOLKS ARE WHEREVER YOU GOING AND THE WATER YOU DRINK.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IS ACTUALLY ALL ABOUT HEALTH.
IF THOSE THINKS AREN'T CLEAN,
WE CAN'T HAVE A HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITY.
>> Stephen: I GET MOST OF MY INFORMATION ABOUT THE EPA THERE FOX NEWS.
SO OBVIOUSLY MY QUESTION TO YOU, MADAME, IS WHY DO YOU HATE JOBS?
YOU ACTUALLY GET PAID ON COMMISSION FOR EVERY AMERICAN JOB YOU DESTROY WITH YOUR REGULATIONS?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE KILLING JOBS, RIGHT.
>> NO, STEPHEN, WE ARE NOT KILLING JOBS.
WE ARE PROTECT THE AIR AND THE WATER.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,
HAVE YOU HEARD OF LIKE TORNADOES, HEUER CANES AND DROUGHTS.
I THINK THAT THE AIR AND WATER IS ATTACKING US.
IT'S DEFENSE RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE PLAYING BIG D WITH THE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW.
>> WELL, NATURAL PROBLEMS CAN BE SORT OF A BEAR TO DEAL WITH.
BUT YOU KNOW, EPA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 41 YEARS.
WE WERE STARTED BY RICHARD NIXON.
>> Stephen: THAT IS HINCKO.
>> BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS TIME FOR US TO DEAL WITH RIVERS THAT WERE
ON FIRE W AIR THAT WAS SO SMOGGY.
>> Stephen: WE HAD RIVERS THAT BURNED 40 YEARS AGO.
THAT'S ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.
WE COULD HAVE POWERED CLEVELAND COULD HAVE BEEN POWERED BY THE CUYAHOGA RIVER.
BUT WAS IT-- WAS IT REALLY NECESSARY, THINGS WERE ALWAYS BETTER IN THE PAST I THOUGHT.
>> NO, NO, NO.
ACTUALLY WE DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DEALT WITH.
WE USED TO HAVE LEAD IN GASOLINEMENT WHEN YOU DROVE YOUR CAR YOUR AUDI YOU COULD
BE PUTTING LEAD ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE AND WE KNOW LEAD IS TO THE GOOD FOR YOU.
WE USED TO HAVE ALAR ON APPLES.
WE USED TO HAVE NOON AT PITTSBURGH YOU COULD LOOK STRAIGHT AT THE SUN IF YOU COULD FIND IT.
IT WAS SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN BEIJING TODAY.
>> Stephen: A NATURAL SUNSCREEN.
>> IT'S BEEN 41 YEARS OF SAYING LISTEN, WE CAN GROW OUR ECONOMY.
OF COURSE WE WANT JOBS.
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO DO IT TO ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE HEALTHY, THAT
OUR FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO THRIVE.
THAT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE PLACES WE LOVE TO LOOK AT AND ENJOY ARE GOING TO BE
THERE FOR THE FUTURE.
>> Stephen: BUT WE DID IT.
WE CLEANED THINGS UP.
THINGS ARE WAY CLEANER THAN WE USED TO BE.
WHY DO WE NEED THE EPA ANY MORE.
YOU DID IT IT'S LIKE UNIONS AN CHILD LABOR LAWS.
WE DON'T NEED THOSE THINGS ANY MORE BECAUSE THEY FIGURED THEIR PROBLEMS.
NOW THEY CAN GO.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE WORRY A LOT ABOUT IS BACK SLIDING.
AND WE AREN'T DONE.
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THIS PAST YEAR THAT WE FINALLY SET A NATIONAL STANDARD IN THIS
COUNTRY TO DEAL WITH MERCURY.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH MERCURY.
I BREAK UP THE THERMOMETERS AND PAINT MY FACE LIKE A TIN MANMENT IT WAS FUN.
AND I WOULD PLAY WITH MY PET INGUT LEADY.
WHAT IS MERCURY DO.
>> WE ARE GOING TO ASK YOU NOT TO DO THAT ANY MORE.
>> I DON'T, LEADIE WENT TO A FARM UPSTATE.
WHY SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT MERCURY.
>> MERCURY IS A NEUROTOXIN IT IS TOXIC TO THE BRAIN.
AND THE PLACE WE SEE IT,
IT'S MANIFESTATIONS IS IN CHILDREN.
MERCURY CAN AFFECT A CHILD BEFORE HE OR SHE IS BORN AND WE CAN MEASURE THE AFFECTS
OF MERCURY POLLUTION BY A LOSS IN IQ POINTS IT STAYS AROUND A LONG TIME.
IT'S LIKE LEAD AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE CAN'T FISH BECAUSE
MERCURY IS COMING UP THE FOOD CHAIN AND COULD AFFECT OUR BODIES.
>> Stephen: NOW DOW FEEL LIKE YOU GOT THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT WENT WITH THE REPUBLICANS ON SMOG STANDARDS.
ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR ROMNEY THIS TIME.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT WE NEEDED TO WAIT AND GET THE LATEST SCIENCE ON SMOG STANDARDS.
WHICH WE EXPECT EARLY NEXT YEAR.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHEN ROMNEY'S PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
