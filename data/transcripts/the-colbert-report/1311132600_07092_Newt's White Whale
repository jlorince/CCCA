(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY!
CHANGE FOR JOINING US.
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICELY DONE.
NICELY DONE.
YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU IN HERE; OUT THERE.
AND, FOLKS, THIS CRAWL DOWN HERE IS MY WAY OF THANKING THESE HEROES FOR DONATING TO MY SUPER PAC.
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS AS PRECIOUS TO ME AS ONE OF MY CHILDREN WHO HAS GIVEN MONEY TO ME.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS YEAR COLBERT NATION IS GOING TO BE A PLAYER IN THE ELECTION.
NOW, I'M ON RECORD AS SAYING I THINK NEWT GINGRICH IS THE GUY.
(LAUGHTER) BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE TO EAT A LITTLE CROW.
OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT NEWT'S BEEN EATING.
(LAUGHTER) I'M GOING TO SAY OREO CAKESTERS.
(LAUGHTER) THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY BACK IN
MAY AND HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN MUCH SINCE APART FROM A GUEST SPOT ON
C-SPAN'S "I LOVE THE '90s." (LAUGHTER) NOW NEWT'S BEEN STRUGGLING IN
THE POLLS, HE LOST MOST OF HIS STAFF, THEN HE LOST THE REST OF HIS STAFF.
(LAUGHTER) AND TO TOP IT OFF HE LOST THE STARTUP DISK FOR HIS WIFE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) IT KEEPS BEACH BALLING.
NOW, FOLKS, THERE'S BEEN MORE BAD NEWS.
ACCORDING TO RECORDS FILED WITH THE F.E.C., NEWT'S CAMPAIGN IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT.
FOLKS, THIS IS PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
NEWT HAS MAJOR EXPENSES.
FOR INSTANCE, HE SPENT $800,000 ON HIS CAMPAIGN WEB SITE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, SURE, NEWT COULD HAVE HAD HIS NINE-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW DESIGN
A WEB SITE AND ALL HE'D HAVE TO HAVE PAID HIM WAS ONE OF HIS OREO SNACKSERS-- SNACKSTERS,
CAKESTERS.
BUT FOR 800K GRAND LARGE, OUT GOT ONE FLASHY STATE-OF-THE-ART INTERACTIVE CYBER WEB PORTAL NET.
LOOK!
IT'S GOT A LOGO AND IT'S CLEARLY PHOTO CAPABLE.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S GOT A "DONATE" BUTTON.
A "DONATE TODAY" BUTTON.
ANOTHER "DONATE TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN" BUTTON AND A "DONATE NOW" BUTTON.
SO CLEARLY...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) CLEARLY THE CORE MESSAGE IS GETTING OUT.
STILL, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY $800,000... WAIT A MINUTE... IS THAT A FACEBOOK SHARE ICON?
(LAUGHTER) THOSE AREN'T CHEEP!
SO CLEARLY EVERY PENNY ACCOUNTED FOR.
BUT THE REST OF NEWT DEBT STEMS FROM HIS FREQUENT PRIVATE JET TRAVEL, LIKE THE $400,000 HE
PRESENTLY OWES MOBY DICK AIRWAYS.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT A SHAME THAT THIS DEBT TO MEMBER BIDICK MAY CRIPPLE NEWT'S CAMPAIGN.
HE HAS PURSUED THE PRESIDENCY FOR YEARS, HUNTED IT WITH A SINGLE-MINDED DEVOTION.
IT'S LIKE THE PRESIDENCY IS HIS... HIS... I'M BLANKING HERE.
JIMMY, HELP ME OUT WITH AN APPROPRIATE IMAGE.
NO, NO, NO.
(LAUGHTER) SOMETHING ELSE.
WHITE WHALE!
(APPLAUSE) WELL, WITH MONEY TIGHT, NEWT WILL HAVE TO ABANDON MOBY DICK AIRWAYS AND START TRAVELING
