>> Stephen: NATION, NOBODY
LIKES A KNOW IT ALL AND I
SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW
ALL OF IT.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG
OF THE FINGER.
FOLKS, I AM A FAMOUS PERSON
WHO I'M SURE GOOG SELL GOING
TO SEND ME THOSE GOOGLE
GLASS GLASSES BUT FOLKS I'M
NOT SURE IF I EVEN WANT THEM
NOW.
>> GOOGLE BANNING PORN ON
ITS FUTURISTIC GLASSES.
>> GOOGLE SAYS PORNOGRAPHY
WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN ITS
NEW GOOGLE GLASS COMPUTER
EYEGLASSES.
THE TECH GIANT MADE THE MOVE
YESTERDAY AFTER A PORN
COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW
ADULT APP.
>> SO A WAG OF MY FINGER AT
GOOGLE GLASS FOR BANNING
PORN.
NOW THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEE
PORN ON GOOGLE IS BY TYPING
PORN INTO GOOGLE.
(LAUGHTER)
OR, OR REALLY ANYTHING INTO
GOOGLE.
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD BUSINESS.
I MEAN GOOGLE IS MAKING A
CAR THAT CAN DRIVE ITSELF.
WHY HAVE A CAR YOU DON'T
NEED TO STEER IF YOU CAN'T
WATCH PORN WHILE IT DRIVES
YOU TO CHURCH.
NOW WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
DO WITH YOUR HANDS IN THERE.
I'M TELLING YOU, I AM
TELLING YOU, THOSE HEATED
LEATHER SEATS ARE JUST A
TEASE.
NEXT UP ON THE-- I LOVE
WESTERNS, THE CLASSIC
AMERICAN GENRE WHICH IS WHY
I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY
FINGER AT THE LONE RANGER.
JIMMY, GIVE THEM A GOOD
TASTE OF THE BAD UGLY.
>> THERE WERE RUMORS THAT
SUSTAINED US, STORIES OF A
MAN, A MASKED MAN.
A LONE RANGER.
>> Stephen: YES, THE LONE
RANGER FACING OFF AGAINST
HIS NEWEST THREAT, A BULLET
GENTLY LOBBED AT HIM BY A
CHILD.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY, I AM SORRY BUT I
CANNOT GET BEHIND THIS
GRITTY NEW REBOOT.
I'M AN ORIGINALIST AND I
BELIEVE THE LONE RANGER
SHOULD BE A CLEAN CUT
GENTLEMAN WITH A PERFECTLY
CRISP LACE UP SHIRT BECAUSE
BACK IN MY DAY OUTLAWS KNEW
NOT TO [BLEEP] WITH A GUY
WEARING A NECKERCHIEF.
>> WHOOO!
(APPLAUSE)
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE N THE
ENTIRE TRAILER NOT ONCE DOES
THE LONE RANGER SAY HIS
FAMOUS CATCH PHRASE HI HO
SILVER.
EVEN IN THE SCENE WHERE HE
IS SAYING I HAD TO A HO WHO
IS HOLDING SILVER!
(APPLAUSE)
COME ON!
BUT WHAT REALLY ASSES MY
CHAFF IS THAT THE LONE
RANGER ISN'T EVEN THE STAR.
>> FROM THE GREAT BEYOND, A
VISION TOLD ME GREAT WARRIOR
WOULD HELP ME ON MY QUEST.
>> Stephen: WAIT, HIS QUEST,
TONTO'S QUEST?
TONTO IS NOT THE HERO, TONTO
IS THE SIDE KICK.
TONTO IS SO INCONSEQUENCE
THAT HE'S BEEN PARTNERS WITH
THIS GUY SINCE 1949 AND
PEOPLE STILL CALL HIM THE
LONE RANGER.
(LAUGHTER)
COME ON!
(APPLAUSE)
I'M ANGRY, I'M ANGRY!
AND LOOK AT THIS INJUSTICE
WHICH IS SURELY THE GREATEST
EVER TO TRANSPIRE BETWEEN A
WHITE PERSON AND A NATIVE
AMERICAN.
>> PEOPLE THINK ARE YOU
DEAD.
BETTER TO STAY THAT WAY.
>> YOU ONLY WEAR A MASK.
>> OH, GREAT IDEA.
TAKE ADVICE ON CASUAL
ACCESSORIES FROM THE GUY
WITH THE DEAD CROW ON HIS
HEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
FINALLY FOLKS, I PRIZE
MYSELF ON ALWAYS BEING UP ON
THE LATEST INNOVATIONS.
WELL, GET READY BECAUSE THE
FUTURE IS NOW.
>> SEEMS THOSE NEW 3-D
PRINTERS COULD SOON BE
PRINTING YOUR DINNER.
NASA IS NOW FUNDING RESEARCH
INTO 3-D PRINTED FOOD.
ONE RESEARCHER IS USING THAT
GRANT MONEY TO PRINT PIZZAS.
>> Stephen: FANTASTIC!
INSTANT PRINTED PIZZA AT THE
TOUCH OF A BUTTON.
UNLIKE DOMINOES WHERE YOU
HAVE TO WAIT FOR 30 MINUTES
AND THE PIZZA ONLY TASTES
LIKE IT CAME OUT OF A
PRINTER.
(LAUGHTER)
SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO 3-D
PRINTED FOOD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DELICIOUS!
FOLKS, HERE IS HOW YOUR MEAL
WILL BE EXTRUDED.
THE PRINTER FIRST PRINTS A
LAYER OF DOE WHICH IS BAKED
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS
PRINTED.
THEN IT LAYS DOWN A TOMATO
BASE WHICH IS ALSO STORED IN
A POWDERED FORM AND THEN
MIXED WITH WATER AND OIL.
FINALLY THE PIZZA IS TOPPED
WITH A PROTEIN LAYER.
HMMMM.
A PROTEIN LAYER.
MAN, MY MOUTH IS ALREADY
FILLING WITH A SALIVA LAYER.
PLUS, PLUS HOPEFULLY WE CAN
COMBINE OUR 3-D PRINTED FOOD
WITH OUR 3-D PRINTED GUNS.
AND MAKE A RIFLE THAT FIRES
PIZZA ROLLS RIGHT INTO MY
FOOD HOLE.
(APPLAUSE)
NOW ACCORDING TO THE FOOD
PRINTER'S CREATOR, THE
TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE THE END
OF FOOD WASTE BECAUSE THE
POWDER THIS SYSTEM USES IS
SHELF STABLE FOR UP TO 30
YEARS.
BUT REMEMBER, IT'S VERY
IMPORTANT, AFTER 30 YEARS
AND ONE DAY, IT TASTES
TERRIBLE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR
DINNER YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN TO
THE WAITER, YOU HAVE TO TALK
TO ALEX FROM IT WHO IS JUST
GOING TO ROLL HIS EYES AND
ASK IF YOU TRY TURNING YOUR
PERSON OMELET OFF AND ON BUT
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE ALREADY
TRIED THAT.
THE PROBLEM IS THE RED
PEPPERS AREN'T COMPATIBLE
WITH WINDOWS XP.
DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?
THE POINT IS, FOLKS, NASA
PRINTING PIZZAS IN ORBIT IS
THE KIND OF INNOVATION THAT
SHOULD MAKE EVERY AMERICAN
PROUD.
BECAUSE WHILE WE'RE DOING
THAT, AFRICANS CONDITION
EVEN GET A LOAF OF BREAD.
IT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER
MOVE.
HEY, SOMALIA, DON'T EAT ALL
THAT DIRT IN ONE SITTING.
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, WE
GOT TO LAUNCH A CAKE INTO
THE SUN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
