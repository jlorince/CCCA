HAPPY DANCING MAN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, LIKE YOU, I AM SUPER
JAZZED ABOUT TOMORROW'S SPECIAL
ELECTION IN MASSACHUSETTS.
TO FILL TED KENNEDY'S VACANT
SENATE SEAT BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS
ISN'T JUST ANY ELECTION.
>> THE VOTERS-OF-MASSACHUSETTS
ARE WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS
NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON THE
HEALTH CARE BILL.
>> IT'S BECOME A NATIONAL
ELECTION.
>> FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS
NATIONAL ELECTION.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
THIS IS THE KIND OF NATIONAL
ELECTION I LOVE, THE KIND THAT
GETS DECIDED BY ONE STATE.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES.
JUST LIKE THE NATIONAL
REFERENDUM IN LINCOLN, NEBRASKA,
ON WHETHER TO INSTALL A
LEFT-TURN ONLY LANE AT ARBY'S ON
CORNHUSKER HIGHWAY.
THE RACE IS BETWEEN DEMOCRAT
MARTHA COAKLEY AND A REPUBLICAN
I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED, SCOTT, I
WANT TO SAY BROWN.
IT IS BROWN?
IT IS BROWN?
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IT.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE ADMIRED THIS GUY SINCE
1982 WHEN HE WON COSMO'S
AMERICA'S SEXIEST MAN CONTEST
AND POSED FOR THIS CENTER FOLD.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, NOW, IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE
RACY, BUT HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
PRO-AMERICAN AND CLEARLY
ANTI-BRAZILIAN.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
POLLS SHOW BROWN AHEAD, PROVING
THAT DESPITE THE KENNEDYS,
MASSACHUSETTS IS NOT A
DEMOCRATIC STATE.
IT'S A HANDSOME-CRATIC STATE.
THAT'S WHY THEIR FORMER GOVERNOR
WAS THE GUY WHO COMES WITH THE
PICTURE FRAME.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, FOLKS, IT REALLY LOOKS GOOD
FOR SCOTT WOLF?
NO, THAT'S "PARTY OF FIVE."
WHATEVER.
HE'S GOING TO WIN.
ANYWAY, HE HAS PLEDGED TO BE THE
41st VOTE AGAINST HEALTH CARE,
AND SINCE MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS
ALREADY HAVE GOVERNMENT-MANDATED
HEALTH CARE, ELECTING SCOTT
BROWN WILL SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE
TO THE NATION, I GOTE, JACK,
YOU CAN SUCK IT.
[LAUGHTER]
AFTER HOPEFULLY... HOPEFULLY
AFTER
