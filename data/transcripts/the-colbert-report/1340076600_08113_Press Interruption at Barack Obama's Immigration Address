THAT IS HOW EFFECTIVE,
THAT'S HOW EFFECTIVE THE POLICY WILL BE.
BUT FOLKS, THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCING THAT HE IS USING HIS EXECUTIVE POBER TO
UNILATERALLY STOP ENFORCING THE LAW WAS SMALL ENCHILADAS COMPARED TO THE BIG NEWS
BURRITO THIS WEEKEND.
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS INTERRUPTED DURING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NEW POLICY.
THAT GUY THERE, THAT WAS CONSERVATIVE BLOGGER NEIL MUNRO.
AND THIS SPARKED A FIRESTORM OF LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES ALIKE.
>> MR. MUNRO WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG IN INTERFERING WITH THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT,
TALKING POINTS ALL SAY YOU MUST RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY EVEN IF YOU
DON'T LIKE THE PERSON IN IT.
THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD INTERRUPT THE PRESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF PREPARED
REMARKS AND SHOUT A QUESTION,
I THINK IT'S OUTRAGE US.
>> HOW DARE YOU.
>> HOW DARE YOU.
HOW DARE YOU, NEIL MUNRO,.
NEIL MUNRO DID KNOWINGLY INTERRUPT THE PRESIDENT.
AS HE EXPLAINED TO COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT NEWS ORGANIZATION THE ONE HE WORKED FOR.
>> FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE,
THE SPEECH WAS COMING TO A CLOSE WHEN YOU WERE BEGINNING TO ASK YOUR QUESTION.
>> YES.
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHEN HE'S ABOUT TO END.
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO END TODAY.
I ASKED MY QUESTION TOO EARLY.
>> Stephen: HEY, YOU GOT TO ADMIT IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHEN OBAMA IS GOING TO END SOMETHING.
FOLKS, THE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT'S PAUSES ARE SO LONG IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE
HE'S WRAPPING UP HIS SPEECH.
REMEMBER THE STATE OF THE UNION.
>> THEY KNOW OUR WAY OF LIFE WILL ONLY ENDURE IF WE FEEL THAT SAME SENSE OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY.
(APPLAUSE) THAT'S HOW WE'LL REDUCE OUR DEFICIT.
>> SO EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY JUST LAYOFF THIS ALLEGED REPORTER.
EVERYONE, EVERYONE WHO WAS THERE THOUGHT THAT SPEECH WAS OVER, INCLUDING ME.
FULL DISCLOSURE, I AM A MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS.
WELL, TECHNICALLY THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS RESERVED.
ONE WEEKEND A MONTH.
AND LAST FRIDAY I EVEN MIXED IT UP WITH THE PRESIDENT.
>> IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> HEY, THAT'S WILLFORD BRIMLY'S CATCH-PHRASE.
>> EXCUSE ME, SIR.
>> Stephen: IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
THAT IS WILLFORD BRIMLY'S OATMEAL CATCH-PHRASE.
WHY ARE YOU STEALING FROM WILLFORD BRIMLY.
>> IT'S NOT TIME FOR QUESTIONS.
>> YOU WANT SOME OATMEAL?
>> NOT WHILE I'M --
>> IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
LET'S ARGUE ABOUT IT.
>> I DIDN'T ASK FOR AN ARGUMENT.
I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION.
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO ARGUE.
YOU DON'T WANT OATMEAL.
THERE'S NO OPEN BAR.
THIS WEDDING SUCKS.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> AFTER THAT EXCHANGE, THIS BOWL OF OATMEAL GOT A SHOW ON BOX NEWS-- FOX NEWS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
