( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  HEY!
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU ALL ONE AND ALL.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S THE REAL DEAL.
THAT IS THE REAL DEAL.
THAT IS THE PURE, UNCUT NEW YORK FLAKE.
FOLKS I AM AS PUMPED AS YOU ARE.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ENGLAND'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES SIR PETER PETER WESTMACOTT.
HE IS IN THE DRESSING ROOM RIGHT NOW, GETTING HIS BANGER MASHED.
I ASSUME.
HE'S HERE BECAUSE THE 2012 LONDON OLYMPIC GAMES START TOMORROW.
ALTHOUGH WITH THE TIME DIFFERENCE, IT COULD BE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW OR LAST WEEK.
THE POINT IS, I AM, WILL BE, OR HAVE BEEN THRILLED.
(  LAUGHTER  ) I LOVE THE SUMMER GAMES.
FROM TRACK AND FIELD TO DIVING TO OTHER SPORTS AMERICA CARES DEEPLY ABOUT FOR TWO WEEKS EVERY
FOUR YEARS.
I WANT TO SAY OCEAN TENNIS OR TWO-MAN BENCH CURLING, OR WHATEVER.
IT'S NOT JUST THE SUMMER GAMES.
TWO YEARS AGO, COLBERT NATION SAVED THE VANCOUVER OLYMPICS BY SPONSORING THE AMERICAN
SPEEDSKATING TEAM WHO BROUGHT HOME THE GOLD, TWO CIVILLERS AND A BRONZE.
NOT BAD.
UNLIKE-- UNLIKE THE SNOWBOARDING TEAM WHO BROUGHT HOME GOLD, TWO DIME BAGS AND A BLACK LIGHT
POSTER OF A SURFING TIGER.
THIS IS THE FOUR REPORT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> THE FOUR REPORT PRESENTS STEPHEN COLBERT '012.
>> Stephen:  OF COURSE, EVERY OLYMPICS BEGIN WITH THE OPENING CEREMONIES IN WHICH THE HOST
NATION SHOWCASES ITS CULTURE,
ITS HISTORY, AND TERRIFYING LOCKSTEP UNITY.
WELL, THIS YEAR, ENGLAND IS PRINGING IT.
ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY "TIME" THEIR OPENING CEREMONIES WILL FEATURE 30 MARY POPPINSES
DESCENDING TO FIND A 30-FOOT LORD LORD VOLDEMORT.
IT'S EVEN INSPIRED AN ACE BOOK IN THE SERIES "HARRY POTTER AND
THE DEATH OF THE FRANCHISE." NOTICE, FOR MANY, FOR MANY, THE GAMES ARE ABOUT WATCHING WORLD
CLASS FEATS OF ATHLETICISM.
BUT FOR ME, IT'S ALL ABOUT HEARING THEM.
THE CRACK OF THE BAT.
THE SWISH OF THE THREE-POINTER.
THE THUD OF MY INTEREST IN SOCCER.
( LAUGHTER ) HEARING THOSE SOUNDS REALLY PUTS
VIEWERS AT THE CENTER OF THE ACTION, BUT AUDIO ENGINEER DENNIS BAXTER SAYS SOME OLYMPIC
SOUNDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO CAPTURE.
FOR INSTANCE, THERE ARE REAL CHALLENGES WITH ROWING.
>> THE HELICOPTER AND THE CHASE BOAT JUST COMPLETELY WASH OUT THE SOUND.
>> Stephen:  SOUNDS TRICKY.
ALSO, AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS IT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR FOR THOSE BOATS TO HAVE TO RACE A HELICOPTER?
( LAUGHTER ) BUT SOUND ENGINEERS HAVE FOUND A WORKAROUND.
>> WE WENT OUT A CANOE WITH A COUPLE OF ROWERS AND COVERED THE SHOT OF THE BOATS.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT,
FOLKS, THE OLYMPICS ARE INJECTED WITH PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING AUDIO.
BUT I SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOUNDS TO JACK UP THE SPORT'S
ENTERTAINMENT VALUE, WHY NOT GO ALL THE WAY?
>> HE GOT IT!
>> Stephen:  THE SWEET SOUND OF VICTORY.
OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE SOUND FROM GAMES THAT NEEDS NO ENHANCING, THE DEAFENING ROAR OF
HOT, SLAPPING FLESH, ECHOING THROUGHOUT THE OLYMPIC VILLANG DURING THE QUADRENNIAL BONE-A-THON.
>> IS TEARING THE LID OFF WHAT GOES ON BEHIND THE CBS AT THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE.
>> SWIMMER RYAN LOCHTE ESTIMATES 70% TO 75% OF ALL OLYMPIANS ARE HAVING SEX.
>> IN MANY CASES IT'S CELEBRATORY SEX FOR THE WINNERS.
IN THE CASE OF LOSERS, IT'S THE CONSOLATION PRIZE.
>> Stephen:  YOU MAY NOT GET THE GOLD, THE SILVER, OR THE BRONZE, BUT CHANCES ARE YOU, YOU
RECEIVE THE WOOD.
NOW, ACCORDING TO OLYMPIAN CARRIE SHEINBERG, THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE IS "A MAGICAL FAIRY TALE
PLACE LIKE "ALICE IN WONDERLAND" WHERE EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
YOU COULD WIN A GOLD MEDAL, AND YOU CAN SLEEP WITH A REALLY HOT GUY.
(  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
EDITION OF "ALICE IN WONDERLAND" THAN I READ AS A CHILD.
LET'S JUST HOPE A MONTH LATER,
NONE OF THE FEMALE ATHLETES ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE THIS.
>> I'M LATE, I'M LATE.
