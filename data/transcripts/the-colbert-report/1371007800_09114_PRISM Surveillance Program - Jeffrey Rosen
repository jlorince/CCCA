YOU SEE THERE ARE ALWAYS
WAYS TO OPT OUT OF BIG
BROTHER.
HERE TO TELL ME THAT THERE
IS NO WAY TO OPT OUT OF BIG
BROTHER IS THE PRESIDENT &
CEO OF THE NATIONAL
CONSTITUTION CENTER LEGAL
AFFAIRS EDITOR OF THE NEW
REPUBLIC AND LAW PROFESSOR
AT GEORGE WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY, JEFFREY ROSEN,
JEFFREY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT THIS NEW ARTICLE IN
THE NEW REPUBLIC, AVAILABLE
ON-LINE ASKING PRESIDENT
OBAMA TO REVEAL THE LETTER
THAT SAYS WHY HE HAS THE
RIGHT TO DO THIS GATHERING
TO THE NSA.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE WITH
THIS-- WHAT'S YOUR BEEF HERE,
SIR.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING THAT YOU
DON'T WANT OBAMA TO FIND OUT
ABOUT?
WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED
FOR A NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.
AND I WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN
THAT DEBATE BY SAYING AS
JUSTIN-- JUSTICE ANTONIN
SCALIA DID JUST THIS MONDAY,
A HERO OF YOURS, A
CONSERVATIVE.
NOW HE'S MY HERO TOO BECAUSE
HE SAID THE FRAMERS OF THE
FOURTH AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE
BEEN APPALLED BY THE IDEA
THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD
SEIZE INFORMATION WITHOUT
PARTICULARLY SPECIFYING THE
PLACE TO BE SEARCHED OR THE
PERSON OR THINGS.
>> Stephen: BUT THERE IS NO
EXPECTATION THAT YOUR PHONE
RECORDS ARE YOUR RECORDS.
IT WAS SETTLED IN 1979 IN A
SUPREME COURT CASE THAT THE
PHONE COMPANY OWNS THOSE
RECORDS.
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT
SUBPOENAING YOUR RECORDS.
THEY'RE THE PHONE COMPANY'S
RECORDS.
THAT ALLOWS THE PHONE
COMPANY TO SHARE THEM WITH
PRIVATE INDUSTRY BUT WE WERE
NOT AWARE THAT VERIZON, FOR
EXAMPLE S SHARING THE MEHTADATA,
THE TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND
DURATION OF MY CALLS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT ON AN ONGOING
DAILY BASIS.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE
PROBLEM WITH THAT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH GETTING
TOGETHER, AS THEY SAY, THE
HEY STAKE, OKAY, THE
HAYSTACK OF INFORMATION SO
THEY CAN THEN FIND THE
NEEDLE IN IT.
ARE YOU ANTI-HAYSTACK OR PRO
NEED SNELL.
>> I AM PRO FOURTH AMENDMENT
AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT
SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE GENERAL
SEARCHES OF INFORMATION ON
AN ONGOING DAILY BASIS
WITHOUT PARTICULAR
INFORMATION THAT IS CLINGING
TO A PARTICULAR CLIMATE.
>> WE ARE BEING GENERALLY
ATTACKED.
WE ARE GENERALLY UNDER
THREAT.
YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAY, THERE
WAS THE ATTACK ON 9/11 THERE
IS THE ATTACK AT FT. HOOD,
THE ATTACK IN BOSTON.
THOSE ARE SPREAD OUT ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY E IT'S
ONLY GOING TO BE IN DADE
COUNTY.
>> WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
THIS GENERAL DATA MINING
WORKS.
THE SENATORS WHO WERE BRAEFED
ON THE PROGRAM, SENATORS
WIDEN AND UDAL SAID AMERICAN
WAS BE APPALLED IF THEY KNEW
THE PATRIOT ACT WAS BEING
USED IN THIS WAY AND WERE
NOT CONVINCED IT WAS
STOPPING SERIOUS THREATS.
>> DO YOU THINK WE ARE
VENNERING FREEDOMS HERE IN
THE FACE OF TERRORIST
THREAT.
>> I THINK NOT ONLY ARE WE
DOING THAT BUT DOING SO
UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE YOU
COULD DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS
IN A WAY THAT PROTECTED PRIV
SEE AND SECURITY AT THE SAME
TIME.
>> Stephen: IT MIGHT BE A
CUNNING PLAN.
BECAUSE HERE AWAY WHY.
THEY HATE US FOR OUR
FREEDOM.
SO LESS FREEDOM WE HAVE, THE
LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO
ATTACK US.
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT FROM THE NATIONAL
CONSTITUTION CENTER AND THE
NEW REPUBLIC JEFFREY ROSEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
