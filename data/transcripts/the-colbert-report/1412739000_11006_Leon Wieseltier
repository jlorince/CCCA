CRITIC, PHILOSOPHER AND LONGTIME EDITOR OF "THE NEW
REPUBLIC." THERE'S YOURLIBERAL RAG. THE MAGAZINE
CELEBRATES ITS HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR, AND
HAS RELEASED A NEW BOOK CALLEDINSURRECTIONS OF THE MIND,
100 YEARS OF POLITICS ANDCULTURE IN AMERICA.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE ACULTURAL CRITIC?
DO YOU HAVE A CRITIQUE OF OURPRESENT CULTURE?
>> OH, I DO, YES.
I DO.
IT'S A VERY ELABORATE ONE.
YES.
SO -->> STEPHEN: TEN WORDS OR LESS.
TEN WORDS OR LESS -- TOO MUCHDIGITAL, NOT ENOUGH CRITICAL
THINKING, MORE PHYSICAL REALITY.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S TEN, DAMN! NOONE'S EVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S TEN, DAMN! NOONE'S EVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
SO YOU'RE ONE OF THEM LITERARYTYPES.
>> MM-HMM(LAUGHTER)
>> STEPHEN: THE MAGAZINE WASFOUNDED 100 YEARS AGO.
THAT'S THE BEGINNING TO HAVE THEPROGRESSIVE ERA IN THE U.S.
>> IT WAS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT'S THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROGRESSIVE
AND WHAT WE THINK OF AS ALIBERAL TODAY.
>> SOMETIMES THEY GET CONFUSEDAND LUMPED TOGETHER.
THE PROGRESSIVES ARE MORE TO THELEFT OF US.
>> STEPHEN: OF YOU?
TO THE LEFT OF YOUR HAIR?
>> ACTUALLY, WAY TO THE LEFT.
THIS IS CENTRIST HAIR.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: WHO ARE SOME OF
THE GREAT MINDS WHO HAVEINSURRECTIONS OF THE MIND?
>> JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES, ORSONWELLS.
>> STEPHEN: KEYNES ECONOMICS --I PAY YOU TO DIG A HOLE,
TOMORROW I PAY YOU TO FILL ITIN, THAT CAT?
>> APPROXIMATELY.
>> STEPHEN: CLOSE ENOUGH FOR MYSHOW.
>> ALL RIGHT THEN
>> STEPHEN: IT SEEMS LIKE THEPEOPLE OF THE NEW REPUBLIC
ARE FOLKS WHO BELIEVE INTHINKING, OKAY.
>> WE DO. IT'S PRETTYOUTRAGEOUS, I KNOW.
>> STEPHEN: IT IS.
(LAUGHTER)NOT VERY POPULAR THESE DAYS.
SELL ME ON THINKING.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO THINK
MUCH ANYMORE.
I CAN JUST FEEL, AND I CAN ALSOOPEN ANY EYES AND TAKE THE
DIGITAL FIRE HOSE FROM MY SCREENAND WATCH VIDEOS AND PICTURES
OF, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE'S PIE-->> AND MISTAKE THAT FOR
THINKING.
>> STEPHEN: NOT MISTAKING IT FORTHINKING, I'M PREFERRING IT.
I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD, BUTHERE'S THE REASON, A DEMOCRATIC
SOCIETY, AN OPEN SOCIETY PLACESAN EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECTUAL
RESPONSIBILITY ON ORDINARY MENAND WOMEN BECAUSE WE ARE
GOVERNED BY WHAT WE THINK, WEARE GOVERNED BY OUR OPINIONS, SO
THE CONTENT AND THE QUALITY OFOUR OPINIONS AND THE QUALITY OF
THE FORMATION OF OUR OPINIONS ISWHAT BASICALLY DETERMINES THE
CHARACTER OF OUR SOCIETY ANDTHAT MEANS IN A DEMOCRACY IN AN
OPEN SOCIETY, A THOUGHTLESSCITIZEN OF A DEMOCRACY IS A
DELINQUENT CITIZEN OF ADEMOCRACY.
(APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STILL FILIBUSTERING.
I'M SORRY.
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUTFEELING?
>> HUMAN LIFE WILL NEVER SUFFERFROM TOO LITTLE FEELING.
WE ALL FEEL ALL THE TIME.
WE'RE MORTAL CREATURES.
WE HAVE HEARTS.
>> STEPHEN: YES.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TOMISTAKE OUR HEARTS FOR OUR
MINDS.
THEY DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
IF WE WERE ONLY HEARTS OR MINDSWE WOULD BE MONSTERS, BUT WE'RE
BOTH.
SO THE ROLE OF THE MIND IS TOACTUALLY QUESTION SOME OF THE
ASSUMPTIONS AND DOGMAS ANDPREJUDICES OF THE HEART.
>> STEPHEN: BUT THERE'S ATHIRD ORGAN YOU'RE LEAVING OUT
>> I BET THERE IS.
>> STEPHEN: WELL, THERE'S AFOURTH.
THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE LEVELOF THE CONVERSATION.
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S YOUR GUT,THERE'S YOUR GUT
THERE'S THE MIND, SAYING WESHOULD DO SOMETHING
DIFFERENT!
THEN YOUR HEART, OH, THIS IS HOWI FEEL ABOUT THE THINGS YOU'RE
DOING. AND THEN THERE'S MY GUTTHAT TELLS ME THIS IS RIGHT.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: I GO WITH MY GUTBECAUSE MY GUT IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE ACTIONS THAT REQUIRECOURAGE, WHICH ARE MY BALLS.
>> RIGHT.
I SEE.
ALL RIGHT.
I SEE.
>> STEPHEN: MY GUT AND MYBALLS --
(LAUGHTER)MY GUT AND MY BALLS ARE FIGHTING
MY BRAIN AND MY HEART.
>> IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL.
WE'VE JUST MET SO I'M NOT GOINGTO DISCUSS SOME OF.
THIS I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THEGUT BUT A GUT REQUIRES
EDUCATION.
I BELIEVE IN EDUCATED GUTS.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE HAVEREASON FOR OUR BELIEFS AND
THEN WE ARTICULATE AND THENDEFEND THE REASONS.
>> STEPHEN: HERE'S A REASONFOR MY BELIEFS.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: THEY FEEL GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)IT FEELS GOOD TO THINK THAT WHEN
I DIE I WILL GO TO HEAVEN.
THAT FEELS GOOD.
IT FEELS GOOD TO THINK THAT I AMRIGHT.
THAT FEELS GOOD.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW THAT IT'SPREPOSTEROUS TO THINK THAT
BECAUSE ONE FEELS SOMETHING THATIT'S THE TRUTH.
>> STEPHEN: NO, IT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S TRUTHY.
WHICH IS GREATER THAN TRUTH.
IT IS INASSAILABLE BECAUSE MYTRUTH IS BASED UPON WHAT I WANT
TO BE TRUE -->> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: -- RATHER THANANYTHING THE FACTS COULD
POSSIBLY SUPPORT.
YOUR TRUTH REQUIRES WORK, MINEREQUIRES MERELY A DECISION.
I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE TRUTH PUNCHALL THE TIME.
>> I CONGRATULATE YOU ON LIVINGIN A WORLD ENTIRELY YOUR OWN.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
IT'S CALLED THE COLBERT NATION!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
