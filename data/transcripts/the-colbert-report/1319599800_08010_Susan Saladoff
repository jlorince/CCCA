>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER
ATTORNEY AND DIRECTOR OF "HOT
COFFEE," A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS.
I'M WILLING TO SETTLE THIS
INTERVIEW OUT OF STUDIO FOR FIVE
MILLION DOLLARS.
PLEASE WELCOME SUSAN SALADOFF!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HAY, MS. SALADOFF NICE TO MEET
YOU.
LET'S GET DOWN TO THE NITTY
GRITTY YOU ARE A FORMER
PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY?
I AM.
>> WHO MADE A DOCUMENTARY
AVAILABLE ON HBO GO AND DVD
NOVEMBER 1.
IT'S TALKING ABOUT FRIVOLOUS
LAWSUITS.
>> IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE MYTH
OF A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
>> STEPHEN: THERE ARE
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS GO AHEAD.
>> WHAT INJURE DEFINITION.
IT'S NEVER YOUR CASE THAT IS
FRIVOLOUS.
>> STEPHEN: I'M A REASONABLE
GUY.
HOW ABOUT THE JUDGE WHO SUED FOR
$65 MILLION BECAUSE A DRY
CLEANER LOST HIS PANTS IS THAT
FRIVOLOUS.
>>?
THAT ONE MIGHT BE FRIVOLOUS,
YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU FOR
COMING BY.
SUSAN, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> THE THING ABOUT THAT HE
DIDN'T FIND A LAWYER.
WAS A LAWYER AND REPRESENTED
HIMSELF.
HE WOULDN'T FIND A LAWYER TO
REPRESENT HIM STOONCHTS WE NEED
TO MAKE LAWYERS ILLEGAL.
>> THE SYSTEM WORKS.
IF YOU FILE A CASE THAT IS NOT
MERITORIOUS.
A JUDGE IS GOING TO THREE IT OUT
OR YOU'LL GET FIND.
THERE ARE 12 PEOPLE SITTING ON A
JURY.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU
MONEY FOR A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT
AND EVEN IF HE THEY WERE, THE
JUDGES CAN REDUCE IT.
THERE ARE VERY FEW FRIF LUS
LAWSUITS.
THERE'S A MYTH ABOUT THAT
>> STEPHEN: IT'S A BIG MYTH.
WHAT A TORT?
>> IT'S INTERESTING.
THE CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT
TORT REFORM WHEN MOST PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
A TORT SAY CIVIL HARM.
WHEN SOMEONE IS HURT AND YOU CAN
BRING A CASE IN THE CIVIL COURT
THAT IS CALLED A TORT WHERE THEY
CAN GET DAMAGESES FOR WHAT
HAPPENED TO THEM.
>> STEPHEN: AND WHAT IS
REFORM?
>> WELL, YEAH.
SO MOST PEOPLE THINK REFORM IS A
GOOD THING.
>> STEPHEN: IT IS A GOOD
THING.
>> UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO YOU UNTIL
YOU REALIZE SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENS TO YOU OR A FAMILY
MEMBER AND YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO THE COURTS ANYMORE AND YOU
CAN'T HOLD A WRONGDOER
ACCOUNTABLE, THEN YOU REALIZE
IT'S GOOD FOR CORPORATIONS AND
THOSE WHO MAKE PRODUCTS THAT
HARM US BUT NOT GOOD FOR AVERAGE
CITIZENS.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE FAMOUS CASE THAT GIVES YOU
THE TITLE OF DOCUMENTARY HERE.
HOT COFFEE.
THE OLD LADY WHO ORDERED A HOT
COFFEE FROM McDONALDS, RIGHT?
THEN SHE GOES OUT TO HER CAR AND
DECIDES TO DO DOUGHNUTS ON THE
GRASS?
AND POURS THE COFFEE ON THE LAP
AND SIEWZ.
>> THAT CASE HAS BEEN CITED AS
SORT OF POSTER CHILD FOR WHAT IS
WRONG WITH THE CIVIL JUSTICE
SYSTEM.
MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE FACTS
COMPLETELY WRONG.
WHEN THEY SEE THE FILM HOT
COFFEE THEY REALIZE THEY'VE BEEN
MANIPULATED BY THE MEDIA AND
CORPORATE AMERICA TO BELIEVE
THAT THE SYSTEM IS BRECKEN.
>> STEPHEN: WHY ISN'T THAT A
CRAZY SUIT.
COFFEE IS HOT.
>> WHEN YOU SPILL COFFEE ON
YOURSELF WE DON'T EXPECT NEED
SURGERY AND GRAFTING BECAUSE THE
COFFEE WAS SO HOT AND
McDONALDS KNEW NO ONE COULD
DRINK IT AT THAT TEMPERATURE IT
WOULD CAUSE THIRD DEGREE BURNS.
MRS. LEEBECK, BY THE WAY, 79
YEARS OLD, NEVER BROUGHT A
LAWSUIT A DAY IN HER LIFE.
ALL SHE WANTED WAS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHEN HER
MEDICAL BILLS WERE AND WHAT
MEDICARE PAID.
McDONALDS OFFERED $800 AND
NEVER ANOTHER PENNY.
SHE WENT TOLL TRIAL.
THE VERDICT, IT WAS TWO DAYS OF
COFFEE SALES OF McDONALDS AND
THEN THE JUDGE REDUCED IT AND
THEY WOUND UP SETTLING FOR A
SMALLER AMOUNT BUT NOBODY KNOWS
THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS SUBJECT TO
A GAG ORDER BUT McDONALDS
WASN'T.
>> STEPHEN: WHY COULD THEY
TALK ABOUT IT?
>> WHEN YOU SET THE CASES?
THE PERSON WHO IS INJURED AND
RECEIVED MONEY THEY ARE SILENT
BUT THE CORPORATIONS THEY ARE
NOT.
THEY PUT OUT THIS MESSAGE OVER
AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT HOW THEY
ARE THEREARE CRAZY LAWSUITS
BECAUSE THEY WANT PEOPLE TO
THINK THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE THINK THE
SYSTEM IS BROKEN, THEN THEY ARE
WILLING TO REFORM IT OR CHANGE
IT WHICH ONLY GIVES CORPORATIONS
MORE MONEY.
>> STEPHEN: CORPORATIONS NEED
THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY ARE JOB
CREATORS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
HOW CAN CORPORATIONS BE PUT ON
TRIAL BECAUSE ISN'T A TRIAL
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A JURY OF YOUR
SPEARS?
>> YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: THEN A CORPORATION
WOULD NEED 12 OTHER DORP RACES
JUDGING THEM.
McDONALDS HAS TO BE JUDGED BY
JACK IN THE BOX AND BURGER AND
PIZZA HUT.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING
ABOUT THE JURY OUR PEERS?
THE 7th AMENDMENT TO THE
CONSTITUTION IS TRIAL BY JURY.
NOBODY EVERY REMEMBERS THE 7th
AMENDMENT THEY REMEMBER THE 2ND
AMENDMENT BUT IT'S A
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE
TRIAL BY JURY.
THAT RIGHT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM US
BY TAX ON DAMAGES, BY THESE
ARBITRATION CLAUSES, BY ALL OF
THIS SO-CALL TORT REFORM WHICH
IS -- SHOULD BE CALLED TORT
DEFORM.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY.
IT TAKES AWAY CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS.
WHAT WE NEED IS TO TAKE BACK OUR
RIGHTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE
COURTS SO THAT WE CAN HOLD
WRONGDOUGHERS ACCOUNTABLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- WRONG DOERS ACCOUNTABLE.
>> STEPHEN: THANK FOR
