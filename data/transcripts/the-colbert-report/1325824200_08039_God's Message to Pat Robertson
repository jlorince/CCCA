>> THANK YOU SO MUCH,
EVERYBODY.
WELCOME BACK.
NATION T IS NO SECRET THAT I
AM A HUGE FAN OF
TELEVANGELIST PAT ROBERTSON.
I WATCH EVERY EPISODE OF THE
700 CLUB, OVER A BIG PLATE
OF PAT ROBERTSON'S AGE
DEFYING PRO TEEN PANCAKES.
AND FOLKS, THEY WORK.
MY PANCAKES HAVE NEVER
LOOKED YOUNGER.
GOT TO HEAT THAT UP.
OKAY.
AND I AM CLEARLY NOT PAST
ONLY-- PAT'S ONLY FAN.
SO IS YAHWEH H GOD.
>> I SPENT THE BETTER PART
OF A WEEK IN PRAYER AND JUST
SAYING GOD, SHOW ME
SOMETHING.
AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU
SOME THINGS I WILL SHARE
WITH YOU.
I THINK HE SHOWED ME ABOUT,
THE NEXT PRESIDENT BUT I'M
NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT
THAT SO I WILL LEAVE NEW THE
DARK.
>> PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.
>> PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.
BUT I THINK I KNOW WHO IT'S
GOING TO BE.
>> Stephen: IT'S PROBABLY
JUST AS WELL HE DOESN'T TELL
US WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO BE.
CLEARLY WHOEVER GOD PICKED
IT'S GOING TO BE RIDICULOUS.
I'M GUESSING THE NEXT
PRESIDENT IS EITHER A POWDER
PUFF GIRL% DISPENSER OR JON
LUNTZMAN.
BUT FOLKS--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: .
>> Stephen: JUST AS WELL.
BUT THAT WASN'T GOD'S ONLY
MESSAGE TO PAT.
>> THE LORD SAID A TIME OF
MAXIMUM STRESS AND PERIL
THIS COUNTRY WILL BEGIN
DISINTEGRATING SO I'M SAYING,
GOD, LET ME GIVE YOU SOME,
SOME SUGGESTIONS AND YOU
TELL ME IF ANY OF THEM ARE
RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OH, IT'S LIKE 20
QUESTIONS BUT WITH THE TEN
PLAGUES.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY.
>> IS IT A MASSIVE POWER
FAILURE.
NO.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I WON'T
NEED THIS, THEN.
GO ON.
>> IS IT IRANIAN OR NORTH OF
KOREA NUCLEAR THREAT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: GREAT, OKAY.
WELL THEN GREAT, I CAN-- I
CAN SELL THIS BACK TO GLENN
BECK.
(LAUGHTER)
NEXT.
>> IS IT THE MYAN GALAXY
ALIGNING.
>> NO IT'S NOT THAT
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OH, OH, IT'S
NOT?
OH, WELL, THEN THANK
QUETZACOATL.
ANYTHING ELSE?
>> WHAT IS IT?
IT'S AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE
AND GOD SAID AND I QUOTE-- .
>> Stephen: WHOA,
WHOA-- HE'S ABOUT TO REVEAL
THE WORD OF GOD, BROTHER
THEODOSIUS, ARE YOU READY.
>> NOS ID FACIAMUS.
>> Stephen: JIM?
>> AND GOD SAID AND I QUOTE,
THIS IS NOT MY JUDGEMENT,
THEY ARE BRINGING IT UPON
THEMSELVES.
YOUR COUNTRY WILL BE TORN
APART BY INTERNAL STRESS.
YOUR PRESIDENT HOLDS A
RADICAL VIEW OF THE
DIRECTION OF YOUR COUNTRY
WHICH IS AT ODDS WITH THE
MAJORITY.
EXPECT CHAOS AND PARALYSIS.
THIS IS A SPIRITUAL BATTLE
WHICH CAN ONLY BE WON BY
OVERWHELMING PRAYER.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO ONLY WAY TO SAVE AMERICA
IS OVERWHELMING PRAYER.
GOT IT.
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE TO STEP UP
AND HELP THE BIG GUY OUT.
FIRST, FIRST I AM GOING TO
NEED MY LUCKY PRAYER HAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHAT, WAIT, YOU
KNOW WHAT, THIS ISN'T QUITE
OVERWHELMING ENOUGH.
I'M GOING TO NEED MY PRAYER
SOME BRAERO.
OR SOME-PRAYER-O.
>> AND OF COURSE MY GIANT
FOAM PRAYER HAND AND TO
REALLY OVERWHELM GOD, BOYS,
BRING OUT THE SACKS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MOST SPEAKER
GOES TO TEN.
THESE GO TO EL HEAVEN.
DEAR LORD.
>> CAN WE TAKE THAT DOWN A
NOTCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> DEAR LORD, WE HAVE HEARD
YOU SPEAK THROUGH YOUR PAT
PUPPET
(LAUGHTER)
AND WE MORTALS ARE HEARTLY
SORRY WE ELECTED BARACK
OBAMA.
HELP US DEFEAT HIM IN 2012.
ALTHOUGH PAT SAYS YOU
ALREADY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN SO EITHER THIS
PRAYER HAS ALREADY WORKED OR
IT HASN'T, WHICH MEANS IT IS
EITHER UNNECESSARY OR
POINTLESS.
OR AND ONE MORE THING, LORD,
WHY DID YOU TELL PAT
ROBERTSON.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, BUT
WHAT ABOUT ME?
IS THERE SOME SORT OF NEXT
PRESIDENT PHONE TREE I CAN
GET ORNTION YOU KNOW, LIKE
IN CASES OF SNOW DAY.
ANYWAY IF IT'S SOMETHING
I'VE DONE OTHER THAN THAT,
YOU KNOW, THAT THING I TRY
TO STOP DOING, I'M SORRY.
AMEN.
JESUS NUMBER ONE.
WHOOO
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT OUGHT TO DO
IT AND PAT, THE NEXT TIME
YOU HAVE GOD ON THE LINE,
REMEMBER HE'S A LOT LIKE
YOUR VIEWERS.
REALLY OLD AND TRUSTING.
SO HIT HIM UP FOR SOME CASH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
