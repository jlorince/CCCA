YOUR CAKE.
NATION, CAN WE TALK ABOUT
COLBERT SUPER PAC FOR A SECOND?
CAN WE DO THAT?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW OUR MOTTO.
SAY IT WITH ME, "MAKING A BETTER
TOMORROW TOMORROW."
YOU REALLY DIDN'T SAY IT WITH
ME.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, FOLKS, WE'LL GET THERE SOME
DAY BECAUSE LAST WEEK TWO YOUNG
CHILDREN, CHARLIE AND GRACE,
ASKED ME WHAT COLBERT SUPER PAC
STANDS FOR.
FOLKS, I WAS SO PROVED THAT I
IMMEDIATELY PASSED THE BUCK ON
TO YOU.
I ASKED YOU TO GO TO COLBERT
SUPER PAC.COM AND TELL ME WHAT
WE BELIEVE NEW YORK AND ALREADY
OVER 40,000 OF YOU HEROS HAVE
RESPONDED, SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A FEW MORE DAYS FOR MY TEAM OF
NOT EIGHT-YEAR-OLD MALAYSIAN
CHILD LABORERS TO SORT THROUGH
YOUR MEANINGFUL SUGGESTIONS.
SUGGESTIONS LIKE AT BARBARA C
TAYLOR WHO SAYS, "I STAND FOR
MAKING THE RICH PAY THEIR FAIR
SHARE OF TAXES, PROTECT
INTERESTS OF THE REST OF US WHO
BEAR THE TAX BURDEN AND DELETE."
[APPLAUSE]
OR AT HEATHER MACK WHO STANDS
FOR SMACKING SLOW-WALKING
PEDESTRIANS IN THE BACK OF THE
HEAD.
SOME OF US HAVE THINGS TO DO.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YES.
POW.
THWACK.
YES.
SLOW WALKERS ARE A MENACE.
[LAUGHTER]
SOME OF US HAVE THINGS TO DO,
LIKE SEND TWEETS WHILE CROSSING
THE STREET.
SO KEEP THEM COMING, BUT
REMEMBER, IT'S NOT JUST YOUR
IDEAS I WANT.
I ALSO WANT YOUR CASH.
[LAUGHTER]
SO MUCH THAT I PUT THE NAMES OF
THE BRAVE AMERICANS WHO DONATE
ON MY CRAWL OF HEROES DOWN HERE,
AN WE'VE HAD SOME IMPRESSIVE
ONES LATELY, LIKE LORD SAURON.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NO SURPRISE THERE, CONSIDERING
MY STAUNCH OPPOSITION TO
ELF-HUMAN MARRIAGE.
IF... IT'S ADAM AND EVE, NOT
ADAM AND ARWEN.
OF COURSE, COLBERT'S SUPER PAC
IS ALL ABOUT BUILDING BRIDGES,
THAT IS WHY I WAS TRULY DWRAT...
GRATIFIED TO SEE EVEN AFTER THE
THINGS I'VE SAID ABOUT MUSLIMS,
I RECEIVED A CONTRIBUTION FROM
ARAB-AMERICAN VIEWER SUQ MADIQ.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
I TRUST I'M PRONOUNCING THAT
CORRECTLY.
YOU'VE MADE YOUR PARENTS PROUD.
YOUR FATHER, LIQU MADIQ, AND
YOUR MOTHER, WHO STILL GOES BY
HER MAIDEN NAME, MUNCHMA
QUCHI...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
I'M GOING TO WARN OUR
AFFILIATES, WE MIGHT BE GOING
LONG TONIGHT.
NOW THE INTERNET WAGS OVER ON
THE REDDITS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT
THESE NAMES ARE PRANKS INTENDED
TO RUSE ME BY GIVING ME THE
BUSINESS.
WELL, I JUST WANT TO SAY TO
THESE WEB IMPS.
YOU GOT ME BY GIVING ME YOUR
MONEY.
YOU TOTALLY HACKED OUR SYSTEM
WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD, BUT I AM
ON TO YOUR GAME, AND I BET YOU
COULDN'T DO IT TO ME AGAIN,
ALTHOUGH YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
HOW FUNNY IT WOULD BE TO DO IT
AT THE $1
