BECAUSE I WILL REMEMBER WHO MY FRIENDS ARE.
NOW FOLKS, SINCE THE BRUTAL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING GOING ON AT
FOX NEWS.
AN I AM CONFIDENT THAT THEY VENT ALLLY WILL FIND ONE.
NOW-- EVENTUALLY WILL FIND ONE.
NOW WHILE MANY PEOPLE HAVE CALLED FOX NEWS AN ORGAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY T WAS
NOT FOX NEWS'S FAULT THAT REPUBLICANS LOST.
IT WAS THIS GUY.
IT WAS-- SHOOT, WHAT'S HIS NAME.
I KNOW DON'T HELP ME, DONE HELP ME.
MOP SQUEEGEE.
(LAUGHTER) FOX NEWS CHAIRMAN AND GOBLIN KING ROGER AILES WANTED SOMEBODY ELSE AS "THE
WASHINGTON POST" RECENTLY REPORTED IN THE SPRING OF 2011 AILES ASKED A FOX NEWS
ANALYST HEADED TO AFGHANISTAN TO PASS ON HIS THOUGHTS TO GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS, RESIGN FROM THE
MILITARY AND RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
AND AILES WASN'T JUST ENCOURAGING PETRAEUS TO RUN, HE PUT A SERIOUS OFFER ON THE TABLE.
WHICH WAS SECRETLY TAPED I ASSUME, BY PAULA BROADWELL HIDING UNDER THE TABLE.
(LAUGHTER) LISTEN PETRAEUS RESPOND TO AILES OFFER.
>> TELL HIM IF I EVER RAN, BUT I WON'T, BUT IF I EVER RAN I WOULD TAKE HIM UP ON
HIS OFFER.
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
>> HE WOULD QUIT FOX.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> AND BANKROLL IT OR MAYBE I'M CONFUSED AND THAT WAS RUPERT.
>> I THINK ONE IS BANKROLLING IT.
>> BIG BOSS IS BANKROLLING IT.
ROGG CERTIFICATE GOING TO RUN AND THE REST OF RUSS GOING TO BE HERE IN-HOUSE.
>> Stephen: OKAY SO, IF PETRAEUS RAN FOR PRESIDENT MURDOCH WOULD PAY FOR IT,
AILES WOULD MANAGE IT, AND FOX NEWS WOULD SELL IT THOUGH THEIR AUDIENCE.
NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, A NEWS NETWORK CHOOSING THE CANDIDATE SOUNDS LIKE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
SO DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
AILES SAID HE DID IT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN FIELD NEEDED TO BE SHAKEN UP.
SO IT WAS REALLY JUST WORRIED ABOUT CASTING HIS REALITY SHOW.
AS A TV PRODUCER AILES WAS TRYING TO AVOID A REPEAT OF 2008 WHEN REPUBLICANS NOMINATED THIS CRANKY OLD
GUY WHO-- HOW TO MAKE A STAR.
LIKE WATCHING A MATLOCK MARATHON ABOUT WHO KILLED THE ECONOMY.
THEY COULDN'T SAVE THE JOHN McCAIN SHOW EVEN BY MAKING HIS RUNNING MATE HONEY BOO BOO.
(LAUGHTER) NOW UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK THAT'S WHO THAT IS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HONEY BOO BOO, A DOLLAH MAKES ME HOLDA.
NOW UNFORTUNATELY, PETRAEUS TURNED DOWN ROGER AILES, I ASSUME, TO SPEND MORE TIME
NOT MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY.
BUT FOLKS, THAT DOES NOT MEAN AILES SHOULDN'T TRY THIS AGAIN IN 2016 OR THAT OTHER NETWORKS SHOULD.
I MEAN MSNBC HAS ALREADY PICKED THEIR GUY.
I SAY--  (LAUGHTER) I SAY IT IS TIME, LET'S JUST GIVE A & E A SHOT.
THEY CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS ON HOARDERS.
NOTHING GIVES A CANDIDATE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE QUITE LIKE SAVING EVERY NEWSPAPER
SINCE 1932.
AND YOU WANT A CANDIDATE WITH MILITARY EXPERIENCE?
THE FOOD NETWORK CAN NOMINATE A RED VELVET CUPCAKE.
AFTER ALL, IT'S BEEN TO WAR.
NOW AILES HAS SINCE SAID THAT THE WHOLE OFFER WAS REALLY MORE OF A JOKE.
BUT YOU KNOW IT MAKES ME THINK, WHY CAN'T A COMEDY NETWORK PUT UP A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT?
OR--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OR AT THE VERY LEAST GET HIM APPOINTED TO
