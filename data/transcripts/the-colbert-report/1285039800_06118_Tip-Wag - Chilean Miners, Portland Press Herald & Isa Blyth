YOU'LL GET ON BILL MAHER.
FOLKS, IF YOU LIKE HATS AND HATE
FINGERS, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
THIS NEXT SEGMENT.
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, 33 MINERS IN CHILE HAVE
BEEN TRAPPED UNDERGROUND AND
WE'VE ALL BEEN PRAYING FOR THEIR
SAFE RETURN FOR OVER SIX WEEKS
NOW.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,
THAT'S ALMOST AS LONG AS WE
CARED ABOUT THE GULF OIL SPILL.
BUT, FOLKS, THESE CHILEAN MINERS
ARE DOING OKAY.
JIM?
>> IN CHILE, THE 33 MINERS
TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN FIVE WEEKS
ARE NOW GETTING AMENITIES MOST
OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED,
ELECTRICITY, WATER, FINE OPTIC
COMMUNICATIONS AND FRESH AIR.
THE MINERS HAVE NOW BEEN GIVEN
PERMISSION TO SMOKE CIGARETTES.
THEY WILL BE SENT TWO PACKS A
DAY TO SHARE.
>> PERFECT, ALL THEY WERE
MISSING DOWN THERE WAS SOMETHING
TO FIGHT OVER.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE
A WAG OF MY FINGERS, THESE DUDES
UNDERGROUND WITH A BUNCH OF
CIGARETTES AND A CABLE
CONNECTION.
NOW THEY'RE ASKING FOR ALCOHOL.
CLEARLY THEY'RE TURNING THAT
CAVE FULL OF MEN INTO MAN CAVE.
FELLAS, I KNOW BRO-MANCES ARE
HOT, BUT THEY ONLY WORK AS
COMEDY, NOT TRAGEDY.
THAT'S WHY JUDD APATOW'S
UNACCOMPANIED MINERS WENT
STRAIGHT TO D.V.D.
NOW NEXT UP, WE'RE STILL PRAYING
FOR YOUR SAFETY.
NEXT UP NEWSPAPERS MAKE MISTAKES
AND NOT JUST BY BEING IN THE
NEWSPAPER BUSINESS.
LAST WEEK MAINE'S "PORTLAND
PRESS HERALD" ISSUED AN APOLOGY
FOR A RECENT STORY THAT HILT A
RAW NERVE WITH MANY READERS.
FOR MORE LET'S GO TO WPBF
PORTLAND'S NEWS LEADER.
>> THE PUBLISHER OF A NEWSPAPER
IN MAINE HAS APOLOGIZED AFTER
RECEIVING HARSH CRITICISM ABOUT
ITS SEPTEMBER 11th EDITION.
THE PAPER GAVE FRONT-PAGE
COVERAGE TO THE END OF RAM ADAN,
SHOWING MUSLIMS PRAYING AT THE
END OF THE MUSLIM HOLY MONTH.
>> Stephen: ON 9/11?
THAT'S SO INSENSITIVE?
ISN'T THERE ONE DAY A YEAR WE
CAN ALL AGREE NOT TO BE MUSLIMS?
I'M PRETTY SURE JEWS AREN'T
JEWISH ON CHRISTMAS.
I BELIEVE THEY ARE CHINESE.
[APPLAUSE]
SO OF COURSE THE PAPER'S EDITOR
AND PUBLISHER, RICHARD WILL MENT
CONNER, ISSUED A FULL-PAGE MAIA
CULPA SAYING THE PAPER SHOULD
HAVE ACTED WITH GREATER
SENSITIVE TO THE PAINFUL
MEMORIES STIRRED BY THE
ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 AND THEY
SHOULD HAVE OFFERED BALANCE TO
THE STORY.
THE PUBLIC'S ANGRY AND IMMEDIATE
RESPONSE TAUGHT CONNER THE
LESSON WE ALL TAKE FROM 9/11,
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ATTACKED US
CELEBRATE RAMADAN, THEREFORE
ANYONE WHO CELEBRATES RAMADAN
MUST HAVE ATTACKED US, THE SAME
WAY DUCKS FLY SOUTH FOR THE
WINTER AND SO DO MY
GRANDPARENTS, THEREFORE MY
GRANDPARENTS ARE DUCKS.
WHICH IS WHY I'M ISSUING A WAG
OF MY FINGER AT THE "PORTLAND
PRESS HERALD" FOR NOT
APOLOGIZING FOR ALL THE OTHER
STORIES IN THEIR PAPER THAT
BRING UP PAINFUL MEMORIES, LIKE
THIS FEBRUARY 13th DINING
REVIEW, FOR GERMAN FARE,
RICHARD'S RESTAURANT CUTS THE
MUSTARD.
NOWHERE DID THEY RUN A
COUNTER-STORY ACKNOWLEDGING THE
PAINFUL MEMORIES OF NAZI
GERMANY.
BY THE WAY, FOLKS, WHERE WAS
THIS RICHARD IN 1939?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO ELSE MADE A
MEAN RHEINISCHER SAUERBRATEN?
HITLER.
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED,
"PRESS HERALD" ON YOUR TONE
DEAF, ONE-SIDE PORTRAYAL OF THE
IN ORDERRIC CONQUEST.
HOW CAN YOU RUN "HAGER THE
HORRIBLE" ON YOUR COMIC PAGE
WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE BATTLE OF
SVOLDER IN THE YEAR 1,000.
DAMN YOU, KING OF DENMARK!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY, A
LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
FINALLY, FOLKS, I WANT TO TAKE A
MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ISA BLYTH,
THE 106-YEAR-OLD BRITISH WOMAN
WHO CREDITS HER LONGEVITY TO
BEING A VIRGIN, ALTHOUGH I WOULD
CREDIT HER VIRGINITY TO BEING
SURROUNDED BY BRITISH MEN.
I RESPECT YOU, MS. BLYTH.
I RESPECT YOU FOR SAVING
YOURSELF FOR THE RIGHT GUY AND
NOT GIVING INTO THE MARRIAGE
PRESSURE YOU'RE GREG FROM YOUR
PARENTS.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING BLIT BLIT
ISA BLYTH A WAG OF MY FINGER FOR
BEING A CENTURY-LONG TEASE.
ISA, YOU KNOW FORBIDDEN FRUIT IS
THE MOST TEMPTING, ESPECIALLY
WHEN THAT FRUIT IS SO RIGHT.
LET ME JUST POUR YOU A SPARKLING
GLASS OF ENSURE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHY DON'T YOU AND I HAVE
OURSELVES AN EARLY BIRD...
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY.
THAT'S THE ENSURE TALKING.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT TAKING YOUR CALCIUM
SUPPLEMENTS BE
