>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, RECENTLY
SAID IT IS STUPID TO DECLARE
YOUR CANDIDACY TOO EARLY.
BUT I WILL REMIND HIM THIS
IS LATE NIGHT.
PLEASE WELCOME MIKE
HUCKABEE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOVERNOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, THANKS FOR COMING
BACK.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SO IT
HAS BEEN A QUICK FOUR YEARS.
>> YES T HAS.
>> Stephen: JUST A FEW
MONTHS FROM NOW IN 2007 WHEN
I PLUCKED YOU FROM OBSCURITY.
>> AND GAVE ME THE COLBERT
BUMP.
>> Stephen: AND YOU WON
IOWA.
>> I KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHICH LEADS ME
TO THE NEXT OBVIOUS
QUESTION.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT?
>> I AM SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT IT I REALLY AM.
>> Stephen: OKAY HOW
SERIOUSLY, LIKE RUNNING,
RUNNING?
>> OR RUNNING.
>> IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.
YOU KNOW, RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT IS NOT LIKE SAYING
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
STRAWBERRY INSTEAD OF
VANILLA IT IS A BIG THING
YOU PUT YOUR FAMILY THROUGH,
YOU PUT YOUR FRIENDS THROUGH,
YOU PUT YOURSELF THROUGH.
AND YOU KNOW, I GOT TO KNOW
THAT MY MESSAGE IS
RESONATING WITH ENOUGH
AMERICANS TO MAKE IT WORTH
THE EFFORT TO GO OUT THERE
AND DO IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SPEAKING
OF YOUR MESSAGE.
LET'S GET TO YOUR BOOK.
IT'S CALLED "I AM RUNNING"
(LAUGHTER)
>> IS THATS WHAT IT'S
CALLED.
YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER BOOK,
IT'S CALLED "A SIMPLE
GOVERNMENT"
>> YES.
THAT'S REALLY THE BOOK
THERE.
>> Stephen: SO NOW WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY SIMPLE
GOVERNMENT.
HOW-- HOW, SIMPLE MINDED?
HOW SIMPLE DO YOU WANT OUR
GOVERNMENT TO BE?
>> WELL, WHAT I TRY TO DO IN
THE BOOK IS TO SAY THERE ARE
A LOT OF ISSUES.
THEY'RE VERY COMPLICATED BUT
WHILE THE ISSUE MAY BE
COMPLEX, THE SOLUTION IS NOT
EASY BUT IT PLAY BE SIMPLE.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE'RE DEALING
WITH AN ECONOMIC MELTDOWN
BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE
VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES
YOU CAN'T SPEND MONEY YOU
DON'T HAVE AND YOU CAN'T
BORROW MONEY THAT YOU CAN'T
AFFORD TO PAY BACK.
NOW INDIVIDUALS KNOW THAT.
BUSINESSES KNOW THAT.
WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT
KNOW THAT?
BUT THEY CONTINUE TO SPEND
MONEY.
IF YOU ARE IN A HOLE, NUMBER
ONE, STOP DIGGING.
IF YOU ARE BROKE, NUMBER ONE,
STOP SPENDING.
THAT'S A SIMPLE PRINCIPLES
APPLIED TO A COMPLEX
PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU CLEARLY
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
>> I AM?
>> Stephen: YES, BECAUSE
YOU-- YOU, THIS IS A TEA
PARTY BOOK.
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT
CONSERVATIVE, SMALL
GOVERNMENT REPUBLICAN BOOK
WHEREAS YOU HAVE BEEN A
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICAN.
AND GUYS LIKE YOU, THE
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE KIND
WERE SORT OF SENT TO THE
BACK OF THE BUS AT CPAC
RECENTLY.
>> I DIDN'T EVEN GO.
>> Stephen: THAT IS HOW FAR
BACK OF THE BUS YOU WERE.
OKAY.
>> HOW ABOUT UNDER THE BUS.
>> Stephen: ARE THE SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVES GOING TO BE
GIVEN A SEAT AT THE TABLE IF
THEY CAN GET THE TABLE ON
THE BUS.
ARE THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES
GOING TO BE LISTENED TO.
BECAUSE I'M HEARING FROM MY
REPUBLICAN BUDDIES, LET'S
KEEP ABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE
AND NOT TALK ABOUT THAT, SO
WE CAN GET THE CENTER THIS
TIME?
>> THE FACT IS SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO
FISCAL CONSERVATIVES.
IF YOU WERE TO POLL THE TEA
PARTY YOU WOULD FIND THAT
WHILE THE ECONOMIC ISSUES
ARE FRONT AND CENTER,
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE HOUSE
ON FIRE, AND THE ONE THAT IS
ON FIRE IS THE ONE YOU PAY
ATTENTION TO, NOT THE ONE
THAT HAS HER
MIGHT-- TERMITES, EVEN
THOUGH THE TERMITES MAY BE
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH.
THAT IS REALLY KIND OF WHAT
IS HAPPENING-- .
>> Stephen: WHICH HOUSE IS
THE TEA PARTY SETTING ON
FIRE.
DID YOU JUST ACCUSE THE TEA
PARTY OF ARSON.
>> THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
WHEN, AS MANY AMERICANS 14
TO 15 MILLION DON'T HAVE A
JOB, THAT HAS TO BE THE
PRIMARY INTEREST OF ANYBODY
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT RIGHT
NOW.
>> Stephen: FAIR ENOUGH.
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.
NOW DO YOU HAVE A JOB RIGHT
NOW?
>> ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL OF
THEM.
>> Stephen: YOU WORK FOR FOX
NEWS.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY
POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES WORK FOR FOX NEWS
RIGHT NOW.
>> NOT NEARLY ENOUGH THERE
NEEDS TO BE A FEW MORE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING
THAT GLENN BECK SHOULD RUN?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE VIEWS THAT THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS
HAVE OF YOUR LIKELY OPPONENT
BARACK OBAMA.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: A POLL TAKEN
LAST YEAR SAID THAT 46% OF
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT
BARACK OBAMA IS A MUSLIM.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU DO NOT
BELIEVE THAT.
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT.
I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS TO
TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU BELIEVE THAT
46% OF AMERICANS ARE DUMB,
STUPID,.
>> NO, I THINK THEY HAVE
COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT IS
NOT BASED ON FACT.
HE HAS ARTICULATED
REPEATEDLY THAT HE IS A
CHRISTIAN.
>> Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY
THINK IT'S TRUE.
>> WELL, AND I ALSO THINK
IT'S IRRELEVANT.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T HEAR A
YES.
>> I THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT.
>> Stephen: ABOUT WHETHER HE
IS A MUSLIM.
I AGREE, I AGREE.
I THINK HE SHOULD COME OUT
AND ADMIT HE'S A MUSLIM.
NOW YOU SAID MITT ROMNEY
WON'T WIN BECAUSE HE
REMINDED PEOPLE OF THE GUY
THAT LAID THEM OFF.
>> WELL, DURING THE LAST
CAMPAIGN--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RIGHT, YOU SAID
THAT.
>> I NEVER SAID HIM.
EVERYONE ASSUMED THAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT HIM.
WHAT I SAID WAS THAT
AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO
ELECT SOMEBODY THAT IS LIKE
THE GUY THEY WORK WITH, NOT
THE GUY THAT LAID THEM OFF.
AND I-- THAT'S ALL I SAID.
AND EVERYBODY SAID OH,
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MITT
ROMNEY.
I DIDN'T SAY MITT ROMNEY,
EVERYONE ELSE DID.
>> Stephen: WELL WA, DO YOU
THINK MITT ROMNEY LOOKS
LIKE?
OTHER THAN GUYS SMILING ON
SES KNEE STREET.
GOVERNOR, THANKS,.
