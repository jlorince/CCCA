WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SAYS
WESTERN DOMINANCE WILL END
IN OUR LIFETIME.
THAT'S RIGHT, AMERICA'S
GOING TO BE REPLACED BY A
CHEAP CHINESE KNOCKOFF.
PLEASE WELCOME NIALL
FERGUSON.
CHEEFERS PLAUS
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, MR. FERGUSON.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
BACK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> NICE TO BE BACK.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN ON
THE SHOW BEFORE.
>> I HAVE.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU COME
BACK AS A DOOM CRIER.
DON'T YOU?
>> WELL, IN THE SENSE THAT I
THINK WE CAN SHAPE UP AND
PULL OURSELVES OUT OF THE
DEATH SPIRAL, I WOULDN'T SAY
I WAS A DOOM CRIER SSES YES,
YOU ARE.
>> I'M RINGING AT LARM BELL.
>> Stephen: I HAVE SEEN YOU
SPEAK.
YOU THINK WE CAN PULL
OURSELVES OUT OF A DEATH
SPIRAL IN THE WEST BUT YOU
THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE
WILL.
>> YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)
ABOUT RIGHT.
>> Stephen: ON THAT CHEERY
NEWS LET'S GET TO YOUR BOOK.
NIALL FERGUSON, CIVILIZATION,
THE WEST AND THE REST.
OKAY, LET'S GET DOWN TO NUTS
AND BOLTS.
WHAT'S THE REST AND WHAT'S
THE WEST.
>> THE WEST STARTS, AN 1500
YORK SPANS TO THE NEW WORLD,
AND EXPANDS FURTHER, AND
GETS TO AUSTRALIA.
AND SO AMERICA IS PART OF
THE WEST.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
>> AND THE REST IS
EVERYTHING ELSE, SIMP EL AS
THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: CHINA IS THE
REST.
>> CHINA IS THE REST.
>> Stephen: IS RUSSIA THE
REST.
>> RUSSIA IS INTERESTING
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IN THE
COLD WAR OF IT AS THE EAST.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS
ANOTHER EUROPEAN EMPIRE THAT
EXPANDED INTO ASIA.
>> Stephen: IT'S KIND OF THE
NORTH.
>> THE NORTH AS WELL.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW THERE
IS A SOUTH TOO.
YOU WANT TO THROW THAT IN
THE CALCULATION.
>> BRAZIL IS PART OF THAT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> THAT'S WHY I USE THE WORD
THE REST.
I DON'T SAY THE WEST AND
EAST BECAUSE WE WANT TO
INCLUDE THESE OTHER PLACES
IN THAT NOTION.
SO THE WEST DOMINATES
EVERYBODY ELSE.
THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL POINT.
>> Stephen: IT IS FAIRLY
COMPLICATED.
>> NO, IT IS VERY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.
IT'S VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
THE WEST DOMINATES THE REST.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK
THE WEST IS FAILING.
>> BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT
MADE THE WEST LEAP AHEAD
ECONOMICALLY AND IN TERMS OF
LIFE EXPECTANCY AND POWER,
WERE SIX INSTITUTIONS THAT
ESSENTIALLY WE MONOPOLIZED
FOR ABOUT 500 YEARS.
>> Stephen: WHAT.
>> COMPETITION, THE
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION, THE
RULE OF LAW BASED ON
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT,
AND PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS,
MODERN MEDICINE, THE SOCIETY
AND THE WORK ETHIC.
WE MONOPOLIZED THOSE
INSTITUTIONS AND IDEAS FOR
ABOUT 500 YEARS BUT WE DON'T
ANY MORE.
BECAUSE OTHER SOCIETIES HAVE
COPIED THEM.
AND MEANWHILE EVENS IF THEY,
IF YOU LIKE, DOWNLOADING OUR
KILLER APPS, WE ARE IN THE
PROCESS OF DELETING THEM AND
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T FOLLOW
ALL OF THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.
>> Stephen: THE QUESTION IS,
WHEN, WHEN WILL WE ALL BE
LOCKED IN A FACTORY MAKING
iPADS FOR CHINESE CHILDREN?
>> SO THE YEAR'S ECONOMY IS
THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD
SINCE 1872.
>> Stephen: NUMBER ONE.
>> AND WILL BE OVERTAKEN,
THE IMF SAYS IT WILL BE
OVERTAKEN BY CHINA IN FIVE
YEARS FROM NOW, 2016.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF, AND I'M
NOT SUGGESTING THIS, WHAT IF
WE ATTACK THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE WE STILL MAKE
WEAPONS, MY FRIEND.
WE STILL MAKE WEAPONS.
WHAT IF WE BLOW THEM UP REAL
GOOD?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING,
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD BE A
MONSTER TO SUGGEST THAT, BUT
IF.
>> THIS THOUGHT DID CROSS
DOUGLAS McARTHUR'S MIND AT
THE TIME OF THE CORE YEN
WAR.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> I DOUBT WHEN WILL DO IT
NOW FOR ONE VERY OBVIOUS
REASON, THAT WE OWE THEM
ABOUT $2 TRILLION.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A PERFECT
REASON TO ATTACK THEM.
BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE-- THEY
MAY COME FOR THEIR MONEY
EVENTUALLY AND SAY YEAH, YOU
AND WHAT ARMY.
>> BUT ARE YOU RIGHT IN THE
SENSE THAT THERE IS LIKELY
TO BE MORE CONFLICT BETWEEN
CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES
AS CHINA OVERTAKES THE U.S.
IN ECONOMIC TERMS.
>> Stephen: SOMETHING THAT
BOTHERS ME ABOUT YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT AMERICAN,
OKAY.
YOU'RE A BRIT, OKAY.
AND YOU'RE PASSING JUDGEMENT
ON THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
PASS ALL THE JUDGEMENT YOU
WANT ON ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND
AND WALES AND SMALL PARTS OF
IRELAND AND EUROPE AND
AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND,
BUS I DON'T LIKE A GUY WITH
THAT KIND OF, PARDON ME,
SPEECH IMPEDIMENT PASSING
JUDGEMENT ON MY COUNTRY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES A
BRITISH GUY KNOW ABOUT
AMERICA.
>> WE KIND OF INVENTED YOUR
COUNTRY.
[BLEEP] ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT [BLEEP] ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT.
>> YOU GREW NEWSPAPER
CHARLESTON, CAROLINA.
>> Stephen: NOT CAROLINA,
SOUTH CAROLINA THAT IS WHAT
YOU KNOW ABOUT AMERICA THERE
ARE TWO OF THEM.
>> IT WAS CAROLINA-- I
KNOW-- I KNOW-- .
>> Stephen: GO AHEAD, COME
ON.
>> IT WAS CAROLINA WHEN WE
FOUNDED IT IN 1670.
>> Stephen: YES, AND WE
KICKED YOUR ASS OUT.
WE MADE THE LORD PROPRIETOR
SAIL OUT HIS BOAT.
>> IT WOULD HAVEN'T EXISTED
IF WE HAVEN'T COME.
IF THE SPANIARDS HAD COME
AND COLONIZED THIS PART OF
PARKER WE WOULD BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION IN
SPANISH.
SO YOU DO OWE US SOMETHING.
DON'T YOU.
COME ON.
>> GRACIA.
>> Stephen: NIALL FERGUSON,
