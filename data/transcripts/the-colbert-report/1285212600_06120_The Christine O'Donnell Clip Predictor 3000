I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE
FAVORITE DUET I'VE EVER DONE ON
THE SHOW.
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, THE MEDIA VULTURES OUT
THERE ARE CIRCLING AROUND SENATE
CANDIDATE CHRISTINE O'DONNELL,
THE WAY CHRISTINE O'DONNELL USED
TO CIRCLE AROUND ANYONE WITH A
VIDEO CAMERA.
I MEAN, CONTROVERSIAL CLIPS ARE
POPPING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE,
AND BILL MAHER HAS THREATENED
THAT MORE ARE ON THE WAY.
>> I HAVE 22 EPISODES,
CHRISTINE.
IF YOU'RE WATCHING, YOU NEED TO
COME ON THIS SHOW.
IF YOU DON'T COME ON THIS SHOW,
I'M GOING TO SHOW A CLIP EVERY
WEEK.
>> Stephen: BILL, YOU CANNOT
DO THAT.
IT WILL TAKE TIME AWAY FROM
ASHTON CIEWCHER DISCUSSING
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPPINGS.
NO SURPRISE, BILL O'REILLY IS
TAKING THE HIGH ROAD.
>> I'M TRYING TO BE FAIR TO
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL.
SHE'S BEEN ON THIS PROGRAM A
NUMBER OF TIME, AND WE HAD SOME
KIND OF CRAZY STUFF THAT SHE
SAID.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY IT YET.
I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS TO
INJURE HER.
>> Stephen: YOU SEE, BILL
KNOWS HOW HURTFUL IT IS TO HAVE
A CLIP OF YOURSELF PLAYED OUT OF
CONTEXT.
[BLEEPED]
DO IT LIVE!
GOOD FOR YOU, BILL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD FOR YOU, SIR.
SHOWING HER CLIP IS BENEATH YOU.
BUT NOT ME.
JIM?
>> AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC COMPANIES
ARE CROSSBREEDING HUMANS AND
ANIMALS AND COMING UP WITH MICE
WITH FULLY FUNCTIONING HUMAN
BRAINS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SHE'S RIGHT.
OH, SHE'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
HOW ELSE COULD STUART LITTLE
HAVE MEMORIZED HIS LINES?
THINK, THINK.
WE ALL KNOW... AND WE ALL KNOW
WHICH MOUSE-MODIFYING AMERICAN
SCIENTIFIC COMPANY MISS
O'DONNELL IS TALKING ABOUT.
IT MAKES THE MICE HUGE AND VERY
LITIGIOUS.
JIMMY, TAKE IT DOWN.
NOW, NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I HAVE
ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THANKS TO
GENETIC ENGINEERING, THEY HAVE
ALSO MADE DOGS THAT CAN FLY
PLANES.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT'S THE NEXT EXCITING
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL CLIP.
FOR THAT ANSWER, LET'S GO TO THE
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL CLIP
PREDICTOR 3000.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY.
HERE'S WHAT WE GOT.
HOW DO WE DO THIS HERE?
HOW DO WE DO THIS?
LIKE THIS?
THE CHRISTINE O'DONNELL CLIP
PREDICTOR 3000 HAS THREE
CATEGORIES, WHAT SHE DID, WHO
SHE DID IT WITH AND ON WHICH TV
SHOW DID SHE TALK ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
SO HERE'S THE NEXT CHRISTINE
O'DONNELL CLIP REVEALING THAT
SHE... KILLED A DRIFTER WITH A
ZOMBIE ON ANTHONY BORDAINE'S NO
RESERVATION.
GEEZ.
ALL RIGHT.
THE NEXT CLIP WILL BE CHRIS TEEN
O'DONNELL ROBBED A BANK WITH A
MERMAN ON MEERKAT MANOR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST.
NOW, CHRISTINE, CHRISTINE, COME
ON MY SHOW, OR I'LL SP
