SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TODO BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE AS A
CONTEMPORARY REQUIRE WRITINGABOUT THE 19th CENTURY I CAN
DO LIKE THE BRONTES AND JANEAUSTEN AND ELLIOTT COULD
ONLY HINT AT.
I CAN ACTUALLY SAY WHATHAPPENS.
>> ALL RIGHT WHAT DOESHAPPEN?

MR. DARCY COME IN AND THENTAKE HER AWAY AND THEN SHE
GETS ON TO THE IMPORTANTWORK OF CUTTING CRUSTS OFF
CUCUMBER SANDWICHES?
WHAT IS THE FUTURE FOR A19th CENTURY WOMAN.
>> WELL, THERE'S LOVE IN THESTORY BUT HE ESSENTIALLY
WHAT THIS IS A BOOK THATCELEBRATES A WOMAN'S
LOCATIONMENT BECAUSE I FELTTHAT IS A STORY WE'VE NEVER
HEARD.
AND AS A WOMAN WHO HERSELFHAS HAD HER LIFE SAVED SO
MANY TIMES BY HER PASSIONFOR HER WORK I WANTED TO
TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHOs WHOLIVES UP AND DOWNS AND
ROMANCES AND DRAMAS MAY COMEAND GO BUT WHAT IS AT THE
CENTRE OF IS IT IS THISDESIRE TO UNDERSTAND NOTHING
LESS THAN THE WORKING OF THENATURAL WORLD.
SHE SPENDS HER COMPLETE LIFEIN DEVOTION TO SCIENCE.
>> IS SHE OBSESSED.
>> SHE'S OBSESSED.
>> YOU DID A TALK ONCREATIVITY.
>> I DIDN'T AND ONE OF THETHINGS YOU SAID IS THAT YOU
DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVETO LIKE SUFFER TO BE AN
ARTIST, OKAY.
>> YEAH.
>> YOU HAVE SUFFERED?
>> SURE.
I HAVE SUFFERED.
>> OKAY, YOU'VE SUFFERED.
AND YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
>> I HAVE SUFFERED BUT IHAVEN'T DEVELOPED A
NARCISSISTIC ADDICTION TOTHE IDEA OF BEING A
SUFFERING ARTIST WHICH ISSOMETHING THAT I OBJECT TO.
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE ISTHIS HANGOVER FROM GERMAN
ROMANT CIVIL THAT SAYS IFARE YOU NOT MISSERABLE IN
MAKING EVERYONE AROUND YOUMISERABLE THAN YOU ARE NOT A
SERIOUS ARTIST.
AND I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
>> VAN GOGH DIDN'T CUT OFFHIS EARS ALIKE A WEIGHT
LOSS.
HE'S A MESSERABLE PERSON.
DON'T GREAT ARTIST, I'M NOTSAYING YOU AREN'T A GREAT
ARTIST.
PAIN ARE YOU AND ARE YOU NOTGIVING YOUR SUFFERING ENOUGH
CREDIT.
>> RIGHT.
I SHOULD SORT OF GO DEEPERINTO IT.
>> MAYBE YOUR NARCISSISM ISSAYING THAT I'M NOT A NARS
CYST-- NARSISYS.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WHOWROTE TWO MEMOIRS IN A ROW
SHOULD HAVE TO DEFENDEDQUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT
SHE'S A NARSISYS.
THAT PUTS ME IN A BADPOSITION.
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT THISIDEA.
WHAT IF EVERYBODY SUFFEREDBUT ARTISTS DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> THEY LEAVE THEIRSUFFERING OUT IN, LIKE PAINT
ON A PALACE.
>> YEAH.
>> AND THEN THEY SHOW YOUWHAT THEY'RE
RESPONSIBLE-- EVEN IF THEYARE NOT SHOWING YOU THEIR
SUFFERING, THEY DON'THAVE-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PAINT THE TIERS BUT YOU CANUSE THE TEARS TO PAINT
SOMETHING PRETTY.
