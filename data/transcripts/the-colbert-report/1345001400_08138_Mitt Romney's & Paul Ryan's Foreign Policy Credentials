>> Stephen: HELLO!
HELLO!
WELCOME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
ONCE AGAIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE BRIDGE OF THE
AIRCRAFT CARRIER "INTREPID" WHERE I HAVE BUILT AN EXACT REPLICA OF MY STUDIO.
IT'S JUST LIKE MY REAL STUDIO ONLY WITH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE OF BEING STRICKEN WITH
SEA MADNESS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, SPEAKING OF INSANITY, WE ARE ALL STILL TRYING TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF
ROMNEY CHOOSING PAUL RYAN FOR VICE PRESIDENT.
I MEAN, DOES IT MAKE ROMNEY LOOK MORE EXCITING?
DOES IT MAKE RYAN LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK?
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE ONE IMMEDIATE QUESTION FOR ANYONE SEEKING THE WHITE
HOUSE IS ARE THESE MEN READY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE?
DO THEY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO PRETEND OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T EXIST?
(LAUGHTER) NOW, ON SUNDAY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS PUT THE QUESTION TO V.P. FOURTH RUNNER-UP AND
G.O.P. PINATA TIM PAWLENTY.
>> THIS TICKET IS NOW LACKING IN NATIONAL SECURITY, EXPERIENCE,
NO VULNERABILITIES THERE?
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS TRAVELED EXTENSIVELY INTERNATIONALLY AND UNDERSTANDS THESE ISSUES VERY WELL.
MY GOODNESS, HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER IN GLOBAL BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS, TRANSACTIONS,
TRAVELING AND UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, CULTURES,
GEOGRAPHY AND THE LIKE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
AMERICA'S ENEMIES HAVE NOTHING ON THIS SEASONED BUSINESS TRAVELER.
(LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY MAY NOT HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY BUT HE IS A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE
ADMIRAL'S CLUB.
(LAUGHTER) WHEN IRAN DESTABILIZES THE MIDDLE EAST BY THREATENING TO NUKE IZMIT WILL STEP IN AND
DEMAND TO SPEAK TO THE CONCIERGE!
(LAUGHTER) MAYBE GET SOME MORE PILLOWS OR FRESH TOWELS.
AND THESE ARAB WORLD UPRISINGS?
LET ME TELL YOU FOLKS, MITT KNOWS ALL ABOUT UPRISINGS.
WHEN COACH PASSENGERS TRY TO FORCE THEIR WAY
