THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY GUEST
TONIGHT IS A PRESIDENTIAL
HISTORIAN, WHICH IS PERFECT
BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT IS
HISTORY.
PLEASE WELCOME DORIS KERNS
GOODWIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
BACK.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
>> ALL RIGHT.
MADAM.
>> YES, SIR.
>> Stephen: PUT THIS IN SOME
SORT OF PERSPECTIVE FOR US.
IF THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 60
SEATS, THIS ENORMOUS...
>> HUGE.
>> Stephen: WAVE THAT HAS
ROLLED INTO THE AMERICAN
CONGRESS YESTERDAY, DOES THE
PRESIDENT HAVE TO NOW CAPITULATE
TO THEIR DEMANDS?
HAVEN'T THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
SPOKEN?
>> I THINK WHAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE HAVE SAID IS A PLAYING ON
BOTH YOUR HOUSES.
LOOK, TWO YEARS AGO WE THOUGHT
THIS WAS THIS HUGE WAVE, TO USE
YOUR MOVEMENT, AND...
>> Stephen: GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY.
AND WE THOUGHT A PROGRESSIVE ERA
WAS STARTING AND THAT EVERYTHING
WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT, AND
NOW TWO YEARS LATER WE'VE
DECIDED A HUGE CONSERVATIVE
MOVEMENT IS COMING IN.
IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.
PEOPLE ARE JUST PISSED OFF AT
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND THEY
WANT CHANGE, AND THEY DON'T LIKE
EITHER PARTY RIGHT NOW.
IN FACT, YOU REMEMBER THAT MOVIE
BY ROBIN WILLIAMS WHERE HE SAID,
"POLITICIANS ARE LIKE A BABY'S
DIAPER, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THEM
A LOT AND FOR THE SAME REASON."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I SORT OF THINK THAT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO NOW WE HAVE... HAS THIS
HAPPENED BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A
SORT OF INSURGENT PARTY WITHIN A
PARTY, THE TEA PARTY WAS AN
INSURGENT PARTY WITHIN A PARTY.
WHEN THEY GET INTO OFFICE, LIKE
YOUR RAND PAULS, WHEN THEY GET
INTO OFFICE, TRADITIONALLY DO
THOSE GUYS CAPITULATE AND PLAY
BALL WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT, OR
DO THEY JUST SHUT THINGS DOWN?
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS.
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GO BACK TO
1912.
>> I AM NOT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO COME
THERE.
LYIVE WITH DEAD PRESIDENTS.
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO 1912.
I WAKE UP WITH THEM IN THE
MORNING.
I THINK ABOUT THEM AT NIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE LIKE "THE
SIXTH SENSE."
>> THE ONE I'M LIVING WITH NOW
IS TEDDY ROOSEVELT.
IN 1912 HE HAD AN INSURGENT
PARTY AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THEY WERE CALLED THE PROGRESSIVE
MOVEMENT.
HE COMES FLOATING INTO THE
CONVENTION.
HE LOSES TO TAFT, 300-POUND
TAFT, GET ON A RAFT WITH TAFT,
THAT GUY, AND HE GETS...
>> Stephen: TAFT WAS THE RAFT
ACTUALLY.
>> AND HE GETS SO SAD, SO MAD
THAT HE LEAST THAT HE BOLTS THE
PARTY, CREATES A THIRD PARTY.
>> Stephen: BULL MOOSE.
>> HEY, YOU DO KNOW HISTORY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: I BONE UP WHEN BIG
SHOTS LIKE YOU COME ON.
>> THEY DIVIDE THE PARTY AND THE
DEMOCRATS WIN.
THE DANGER IS THE TEA PARTY
PEOPLE DON'T SOUND LIKE THEY'RE
READY TO COMPROMISE.
>> Stephen: WHY SHOULD THEY
COMPROMISE?
WHY SHOULD THEY COMPROMISE?
THEY ARE ANGRY AND ANGER IS
ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE
THINGS.
>> FEAR.
>> Stephen: FEAR AND ANGER.
HISTORICALLY, WHAT WOULD YOU
COMPARE THIS TO, AND DON'T GO
BACK ANY FURTHER THAN 2009
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HISTORY.
BUT ANYWHERE IN AMERICAN
HISTORY, HAS WILL THERE BEEN
THIS KIND OF SWEEP OF ANGER THAT
CHANGES THE CONGRESS?
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED IN 1946,
I'M FLOATING BACK TO THERE RIGHT
NOW, IS PEOPLE WERE RALLY UPSET
WITH HARRY TRUMAN.
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO FIT INTO THE
SHOES OF F.D.R., THEIR BELOVED
PRESIDENT WHO DIED.
A HUGE SWEEP IN THE CONGRESS.
THEY LOST MORE SEATS THAN THE
DEMOCRATS LAST LOST LAST NIGHT,
BUT HARRY WAS THEN FREE TO BE
HIMSELF AND HE BECAME... WHAT'S
THAT EYEBROW GOING UP?
HE BECAME GIVE 'EM HELL HARRY.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE EVENTUALLY
LIKED HIM.
>> HE CAME OUT OF IT, TRUMAN
FACED THIS.
TRUMAN CAME OUT OF THIS SMELLING
LIKE A ROSE.
WHAT DOES OBAMA SMELL LIKE RIGHT
NOW?
>> I THINK HE'S GOT TO SMELL
MORE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
HE'S TOO STERILE?
>> I THINK WE NEED TO SEE HIM
SWEATING.
THERE IS A CERTAIN THING, TRUMAN
WAS A FIGHTER.
YOU WANT THE GUY FIGHTING.
WHEN YOU FIGHT, YOU MAY HAVE
SWEAT AND SMELL.
THAT MAY BE GOOD RIGHT NOW.
>> HE WAS FACING HUGE OPPOSITION
FROM THE REPUBLICANS WHEN HIS
PARTY CONTROLLED CONGRESS.
NOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST
THE HOUSE, WHAT IS THE BEST
THING FOR OBAMA TO BE DOING FOR
NEXT TWO YEARS, LIKE LEARNING
LIKE TO KNIT OR JIM SHAW OR
SOMETHING?
WHAT'S THE BEST USE OF HIS TIME
BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO GET
ANYTHING PASSED, IS HE?
>> IT'S NOT THE BEST USE OF HIS
TIME.
IT'S THE COUNTRY'S TIME.
IT'S RIDICULOUS WE'RE ALREADY
TALKING ABOUT 2012 AND WE'RE NOT
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THIS COUNTRY IN THE NEXT TWO
YEARS.
WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA NUMBER
ONE IN THE WORLD.
WE HAVE TO BEAT CHINA AND FIGURE
OUT HOW TO BECOME THE GREAT
ECONOMY.
ROOSEVELT DID THAT.
IN 1940 HE SHIFTED GEARS.
HE KNEW THE WAR WAS OUT THERE.
HE SAID, I HAVE TO MAKE MY PEACE
WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.
HE GAVE THEM EVERYTHING HE NEED,
BUT HE PROTECTED UNIONS AND
PENSIONS.
IF HE GOES TO THEM AND SAYS,
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ACCELERATED
DEPRECIATION, INVESTMENT TAX
CREDITS, YOU CLAIM THAT WILL
CREATE JOBS, I'LL GIVE IT TO
YOU, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO
IT ON THE BACKS OF THE PEOPLE.
I THINK THAT WOULD WORK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WOULDN'T A SMART
PLAY FOR THE REPUBLICANS BE,
REALLY GET NOTHING DONE BECAUSE
IF OBAMA'S POLICIES, WHICH ARE
IN PLACE RIGHT NOW, DON'T WORK,
THEN IT WAS RIGHT FOR THEM TO
HAVE SWEPT INTO POWER?
AND IF OBAMA'S POLICIES ARE THE
CORRECT POLICIES, THEN THE
REPUBLICANS WILL GET THE CREDIT
FOR THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE
ECONOMY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS,
SO SHOULDN'T THEY JUST SIT ON
THEIR HANDS AND SAY THE
DEMOCRATS KEEP STOPPING US?
>> THIS SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE
MATHEMATICAL ANALOGIES.
>> Stephen: A TRAIN LEAVES
CHICAGO GOING 60mph AND
MITCH McCONNELL DERAILS IT
NEAR CLEVELAND.
SO YOU FAMOUSLY WROTE ABOUT HOW
LINCOLN FACED... HE SURROUNDED
HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE
ESSENTIALLY HOSTILE TO HIM AND
YET WORKED WITH THEM TO GET
THINGS DONE, AND IT WAS A GREAT
PRESIDENT.
>> A GREAT PRESIDENT.
>> NOW, DOES OBAMA HAVE A SHOT
AT BEING AN EVEN GREATER
PRESIDENT NOW THAT HE IS
SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO TRULY,
TRULY WISH HIM ILL?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, ACTUALLY
THAT'S NOT A CRAZY QUESTION
BECAUSE ADVERSITY SOMETIMES
MAKES A PERSON GREAT.
IF ROOSEVELT HAD NOT HAD HIS
POLIO, THEY SAID HE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
CONNECT TO PEOPLE WHO FATE HAD
ALSO DEALT AN UNKIND HAND.
THIS GUY HAS BEEN HUMBLED NOW.
HE'S INCREDIBLY SERENE, POISED
AND CONFIDENT.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT DIDN'T GO RIGHT AND WHAT AM
I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT.
A LITTLE SELF-DEPRECATING HUMOR
WOULD HELP NOW.
HE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE
FUNNY AND LAUGH.
SOMEBODY SAID TO LINCOLN AT ONE
POINT, YOU'RE TWO-FACED,
MR. LINCOLN.
HE SAID, "IF I HAD TWO FACES, DO
YOU THINK I'D BE WEARING THIS
FACE?"
THAT'S THE KIND OF
