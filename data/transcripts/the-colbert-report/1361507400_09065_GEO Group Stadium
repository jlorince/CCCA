GROUP THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT SPORTS IS STADIUMS NAMED AFTER CORPORATIONS.
IT'S WIN-WIN.
THE TEAMS GET MONEY, AND THE CORPORATIONS GET ADVERTISING THAT REALLY WORKS.
I MEAN, GOING TO COORS FIELD MAKES ME CRAVE THE SILVER BULLET.
AND ANY TIME I GO TO SEE THE PATRIOTS PLAY AT GILLETTE STADIUM, I'M AS HAIRLESS AS A
NEWBORN MOLE RAT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I WAS ESPECIALLY PUMPED ABOUT THE LATEST COMPANY TO GET IN ON THE STADIUM NAMING ACTION.
>> AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY'S FOOTBALL STADIUM HAS A NAME.
>> IT'S NAMED AFTER A PRISON COMPANY.
>>IT WILL BE CALLED GEO GROUP STADIUM AFTER GET THIS THE NATION'S LARGEST OPERATOR OF FOR
PROFIT PRISONS.
THEY MADE A $6 MILLION DONATION.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
A PRIVATE PRISON COMPANY IS SPONSORING A SPORTS VENUE.
IT'S LIKE BANK OF AMERICA STADIUM ONLY THIS COMPANY BELIEVES IN PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S ABOUT TIME!
FOLKS -- IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STARTED EMBRACING FORPROFIT INCARCERTION.
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT OF TAKING HOMICIDIAL MANIACS OFF THE STREETS IF NO ONE'S MAKING
COIN OFF IT?
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, NAYSAYERS ARE IN A SNIT JUST BECAUSE THE GEO-GROUP'S PRISONS HAVE BEEN
ACCUSED OF UNNECESSARY DEATHS OF PEOPLE IN THEIR CUSTODY.
THAT CHILDREN DETAINED IN ITS FACILITIES SUFFERED CRUEL TREATMENTS.
AND THAT GEO GROUP'S  WALNUT GROVE YOUTH CORRECTIONAL FACILITY HAD A "PERVASIVE LEVEL
OF BRAZEN STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
BRAZEN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT?
THAT'S A NATURAL FIT WITH FOOTBALL.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS CRITICISM IS ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES OF PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HAVE PEOPLE
PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR COMPANY.
PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR COMPANY.
AND ASKING RIDICULOUS INVASIVE QUESTIONS LIKE "SO THE MONEY YOU'RE USING TO PAY FOR
THESE NAMING RIGHTS ON A SCHOOL BUILDING CAME FROM PROFITS YOU MADE LOCKING UP CHILDREN AND
OCCASIONALLY ABUSING THEM?" WHILE IGNORING MORE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LIKE, "IS THE MONEY
GREEN?" WHRAF WHRAF.
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES, FANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY LOVE "FREE HAT DAY." THINK HOW MUCH THEY'LL LOVE HOLDING SHARPENED SPOON
"FREE SHIV MADE FROM A BROKEN SPOON NIGHT."
[LAUGHTER]
PERSONALLY I THINK THEY LOVE BROKEN SPOON NIGHT.
SO I THINK AMERICA NEEDS MORE INTERGRATION OF ATHLETICS AND FOR-PROFIT PRIVATE INCACERATION.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, THE CHINESE ARE WAY AHEAD OF US ON THIS.
THEY HAVE ALREADY PERFECTED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN GO TO PRISON AND END UP PLAYING
FOOTBALL-- FOREVER.
[LAUGHTER]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
