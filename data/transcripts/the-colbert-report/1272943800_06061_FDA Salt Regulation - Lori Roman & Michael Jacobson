[LAUGHING]
SPEAKING OF TERRORIST, BARACK OBAMA.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS SOCIALIST MULLAH IS NOW HELL-BENT ON CONTROLLING OUR LIVES.
HE WANTS TO CHOOSE OUR HEALTH CARE, CONTROL OUR BANKS,
REDISTRIBUTE OUR WEALTH, AND NOW HE'S AFTER OUR TASTEBUDS.
>> GOVERNMENT REGULATORS ARE NOW KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE ON YOUR SALT INTAKE.
>> THESE DAYS SALT IS UNDER ATTACK.
>> F.D.A. WANTS TO TELL US WE'RE EATING TOO MUCH SALT.
>> LEAVE MY FRENCH FRIES ALONE.
LEAVE MY CHIPS ALONE.
LEAVE MY CHEESEBURGERS ALONE.
LEAVE MY PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS ALONE.
LEAVE ME ALONE.
>> WOW.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE FIRED COLMES.
BUT CONSIDER THIS, FOLK, WHY IS PRESIDENT OBAMA AFTER OUR SALT?
IS IT BECAUSE IT'S WHITE?
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHY NO BAN ON PEPPER,
MR. PRESIDENT?
I'M JUST SAYING, DON'T BE SURPRISED IF HE REPLACES JUSTICE STEVENS WITH A PEPPER MILL,
ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT JUST GO WITH A WISE HABANERO.
THE F.D.A. IS PLANNING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF SALT IN PROCESSED FOODS.
THAT'S RIGHT, THE FEDS WANT TO RUIN THE FLAVOR OF MY FATTY SALTY CRISPIES AND MY SALTY
CRISPY FATTY, NOT TO MENTION MY TWICE-BAKED FROSTIN' FRIES,
THOUGH TECHNICALLY THESE ARE CLASSIFIED AS PACKING MATERIAL.
NOW, RIGHT NOW...
[LAUGHTER]
RIGHT NOW THE F.D.A. RECOMMENDS NO MORE THAN 2,300 OF MILLIGRAMS OF SODIUM PER DAY, BUT RED
LOBSTER'S ADMIRAL'S FEAST ALONE HAS 7,100 MILLIGRAMS OF SODIUM.
TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE,
THE ONLY TIME AN ACTUAL ADMIRAL CONSUMES THAT MUCH SALT IS WHEN HE'S DROWNING.
WELL, FOLKS, I AM TAKING A STAND.
OR TECHNICALLY I'M TAKING A SIT.
THANKS TO MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, MY DOCTOR ADVISES ME AGAINST STRENUOUS ACTIVITIES LIKE STANDING.
LUCKILY THERE ARE OTHER CALM BRINY HEADS OUT THERE, LIKE THE GOOD FOLKS AT THE SALT
INSTITUTE, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SALK INSTITUTE.
HERE'S HOW YOU KEEP THEM STRAIGHT, SALK UNDERSTANDTY TIEWTD CURES POLIO.
SALT INSTITUTE CURES HAM.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, ACCORDING TO THE SALT INSTITUTE, THE SCIENCE REGARDING SODIUM IS UNCLEAR, AND THE
150,000 PREMATURE DEATHS A YEAR BLAMED ON SALT ARE BOGUS.
TURNS OUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY CAUSED BY SOME NEW STREET DRUG CALLED NACKLE.
THERE'S YOUR REAL KILLER.
[APPLAUSE]
REMEMBER... REMEMBER, KIDS,
NACKLE IS WHACKLE.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, WE CAN'T LET THE GOVERNMENT DO TO SALT WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE TO CIGARETTES.
WILL SALT LOVERS BE OSTRACIZED AND FORCE TO TAKE PRETZEL BREAKS OUTSIDE THEIR OFFICE BUILDINGS?
HERE TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SALT INSTITUTE,
LORI ROMAN, AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST,
MICHAEL JACOBSEN.
WELCOME.
WELCOME BOTH OF YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]
LORI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
LET ME GET THESE SWEET THINGS OUT OF THE WAY.
SALTED NUT?
>> I WOULD LOVE ONE AFTERWARDS.
>> Stephen: OKAY, LORI, LET'S DISPEL THIS MYTH THAT SALT IS BAD FOR YOU.
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
>> WELL, THE MYTH COMES FROM THE FOOD POLICE, AND IT DOES COME
FROM WHAT I THINK YOU WOULD CALL TRUTHINESS, WHICH IS WHAT THEY BASE THEIR FACTS ON.
SOME OF THESE FACTS JUST HAVE NO BASIS IN SCIENCE.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT BASIS IN RELIGION.
DIDN'T JESUS LOVE SALT?
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
SALTZ HE SAID "YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH."
>> HE DID SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: AND IF SALT SHOULD LOSE ITS SALTINESS, WHEREIN SHOULD IT GET ITS SALT BACK,
OTHER THAN FROM THESE NUTS?
BECAUSE THESE ARE SUPER SALTY, I HAVE TO SAY.
I THINK I'M GOING DOWN.
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY ARGUMENTS WE HAVE AT THE SALT INSTITUTE, BUT MAYBE WE'LL ADD THAT.
>> Stephen: TALK ABOUT THESE ACCUSATIONS.
MICHAEL, YOU'RE FROM THE CENTER OF SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY ADMIRAL BUZZ STOMP.
150,000 PEOPLE KILLED A YEAR NEEDLESSLY BECAUSE OF SALT.
HOW?
>> TOO MUCH SALT CAUSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
IT CAUSES HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES.
>> Stephen: MAYBE THE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKING US NERVOUS AND
TENSE ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SALT WE'RE USING.
JUST CHILL-AX MY FRIEND.
BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS AND SALSA?
>> IT LOOKS VERY GOOD.
>> Stephen: IT IS VERY GOOD,
AND THEY'RE VERY...
>> SALTY.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY ARE.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE GOOD.
>> YOU SAID IT ALL.
TOO MUCH SALT IS KILLING ABOUT 150,000 PEOPLE PREMATURELY EVERY YEAR, AND THAT VIEW HAS BEEN
ENDORSED BY EVERYBODY FROM THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE LEAVING ONE ORGANIZATION OUT, SIRFUL THE SALT INSTITUTE.
>> DEFINITELY.
>> Stephen: SO ALL THESE HIGH FLUTE NT MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE SAYING THAT SALT IS LIKE
JUST PACK A GUN WITH SALT AND FIRE IT THROUGH YOUR BRAIN.
>> WELL, I THINK THAT THE FOOD POLICE ARE MAYBE PRACTICING A LITTLE POLICE BRUTALITY THIS
TIME, BECAUSE UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS THEY'VE TARGETED IN THE PAST, YOU NEED SALT TO LIVE.
YOU CANNOT SALT WITHOUT IT.
>> Stephen: IF YOU EAT ENOUGH SALT, YOU'LL BE LIKE A BEEF AND LIVE FOREVER.
RIGHT?
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT, TOO.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, SIR,
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU'RE ANTI-RELIGIOUS.
ARE YOU GOING TO HAUL AWAY GOD FOR TOO MUCH SALT?
>> I BELIEVE IN GOD JUST LIKE YOU, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN WHAT
THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS, INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DETERMINING HOW MUCH SALT IS IN OUR FOODS.
TWO TO THREE TIMES AS MUCH SALT IN ONE MEAL AS YOU SHOULD HAVE IN AN ENTIRE DAY.
AND IT WOULD BE FUNNY EXCEPT IT'S KILLING OVER 100,000 PEOPLE A YEAR TOTALLY UNNECESSARILY.
>> Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE JOKE.
[LAUGHTER]
LORI ROMAN, I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.
>> WELL, I BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU BECAUSE WHEN MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND
THE F.D.A. ARE DONE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SMUGGLE THAT LIKE ANOTHER WHITE POWDER, BUT I
DO WANT TO SAY...
>> Stephen: YOU HEARD HER,
FOLKS.
