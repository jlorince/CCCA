(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU, NATION.
I'M A MEMBER OF THE CLEAN PLATE
CLUB AND I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
WE ARE NOW LETTING IN JEWS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD.
FOLKS, ONCE AGAIN THE FOOD
POLICE ARE ON THE ATTACK.
FIRST THEY CAME FOR OUR SUGARED
CEREAL AND I SAID NOTHING.
THEN THEY CAME FOR OUR TRANS
FATS AND I SAID NOTHING.
(LAUGHTER)
THEN THEY CAME FOR OUR SALT AND
AGAIN I SAID NOTHING BECAUSE MY
MOUTH WAS JAMMED WITH FRITO'S.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL NOW, NOW THEY'RE COMING FOR
OUR TOTS-- BOTH HUMAN AND TATER.
JIM?
>> POTATO MAY BE GETTING THE
BOOT FROM NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH
PROGRAMS.
NEW FEDERAL GUIDELINES LOOK TO
ELIMINATE POTATOES FROM
BREAKFAST AND LIMIT THEM PRETTY
SEVERELY AT LUNCHTIME.
>> Stephen: NO POTATOS?
WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'RE IRISH?
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT'S NEXT?
LIMITING THE AVAILABILITY OF
SHAMROCK SHAKES TO JUST ST.
PATRICK'S DAY?
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT?
YOU RACIST!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SEE, THE FOOD FASHIONISTS AT
THE U.S.D.A. BELIEVE THAT
FOCUSING MORE ON FRUITS,
VEGETABLES, AND WHOLE GRAINS
WILL HELP SOLVE CHILDHOOD
OBESITY.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
CHILDHOOD OBESITY WILL TAKE CARE
OF ITSELF WHEN IT BECOMES ADULT
OBESITY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST AN ATTACK ON
OUR BELLIES, FOLKS, IT IS AN
ATTACK ON THE AMERICAN SCHOOL
LUNCH TRADITION OF A TRAY FULL
OF FRIED TATER TOTS.
YOU DON'T LET OUR CHILDREN SNACK
ON THAT DELICIOUS GOLDEN BROWN
STARCH BOMB YOU'RE TAKING AWAY
THE SMALL SHRED OF HAPPINESS IN
THE OTHERWISE NON-STOP HELL
PARADE THAT IS BEING A MIDDLE
SCHOOLBOY.
(LAUGHTER)
A BOY GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD
STAGE WHERE HIS NOSE AND TEETH
GREW FULL SPEED WHILE THE REST
OF HIS HEAD STILL BELONGS TO A
NINE-YEAR-OLD.
AND EVERYDAY JEFFREY OZER WALKS
INTO HOME ROOM AND POURS TOILET
WATER INTO HIS BACKPACK THEN
SPENDS THE REST OF THE DAY CALL
HIM TOILET BOY AND EVEN SWEET
BEAUTIFUL COLLEEN ALLEN CAN'T
HELP BUT JOIN IN EVEN IF THIS
BOY KNOWS IN HIS HEART THEY'RE
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER AND ALL
THAT PAIN GOES AWAY FROM THE
SPUD-INDUCED TORPOR THAT IS A
STOMACH FULL OF FRIED POTATO!
IT IS MORE THAN FOOD!
IT IS MORE THAN FOOD!
IT IS KID XANAX.
A HUG HE GETS FROM THE INSIDE!
A GRAEG GREASE-SOAKED HAMMER HE
USED TO POUND HIS EMOTIONS DOWN,
DOWN, DOWN UNTIL THEY'RE BURIED
EVEN DEEPER THAN THE POTATO THAT
SOOTHED HIM!
THOSE FEELINGS LAY DORMANT UNTIL
10th GRADE UNTIL JEFFREY OZER
FLICKS ONE TOO MANY RUBBER BANDS
IN HIS EAR BUT THIS TIME THE BOY
IS FULLY GROWN AND HE SLAMS
JEFFREY'S HEAD OVER AND OVER
INTO A LOCKER UNTIL HE HAS TO BE
DRAGGED AWAY FROM THE GIRL'S
SWITCH COACH!
BECAUSE WHO'S THE TOILET BOY NOW
JEFFREY?
WHO'S THE TOILET BOY NOW?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YORE IDA.
NEXT UP, STUTD DEES SHOW THAT A
RECORD ONE IN SEVEN AMERICANS
RECEIVE FOOD STAMPS AND THEY ARE
SUFFERING, FOLKS, BECAUSE
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS PROHIBIT
FOOD STAMPS FROM BEING USED AT
FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS.
WHERE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GO,
THE GROCERY SNORE THAT'S
UNSANITARY.
A LOT OF THAT FOOD WAS RECENTLY
ON THE GROUND!
BUT THANKFULLY, YUM FOODS IS
TAKING COURT ACTION.
THE RESTAURANT CONGLOMERATE
WHICH INCLUDES TACO BELL, K.F.C.
LONG JOHN SILVER'S AND PIZZA HUT
IS APPLYING FOR INCLUSION IN THE
FOOD STAMP PROGRAM.
BUT CONGRATULATIONS, POOR PEOPLE
YOU'RE ON THE YUM FOODS GRAVY
TRAIN.
WARNING: GRAVY TRAIN MAY CONTAIN
NO ACTUAL GRAVY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, OF COURSE, THE NUTRI NAZIS
AT THE GASTROSTAPO ARGUE THAT
THESE DIETS CAUSE UNFORTUNATE
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND POOR
NUTRITION BUT FOLKS I SAY THIS
IS DISCRIMINATION.
THESE ARE FOOD STAMPS!
SO THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING
THESE AREN'T FOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, I'M SORRY, FOLKS, BUT TACO
BELL IS A SPONSOR AND GODDAMNIT,
IF THEY SAY THEY SERVE FOODLY
TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD!
I DON'T CARE IF THAT GETS ME
HATE MAIL.
I DON'T CARE IF THAT COSTS ME
ANOTHER EMMY.
YOU CAN CITE YOUR SCIENTIFIC
STUDIES AND QUOTE YOUR RELIGIOUS
LEADERS.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE F.D.A.
SAYS.
TACO BELL IS FOOD.
I HAVE BEEN TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP
AND THERE WAS A TACO BELL THERE
AND I ATE SOME BECAUSE IT IS
POSSIBLE TO DO SO!
IN FACT, I WILL NOW PROVE IT.
I WILL NOW PROVE IT BY INGESTING
THIS DELICIOUS TACO BELL NACHO
CHEESE GORDITA.
(LAUGHTER)
MMM!
FOOD!
IT HAD BETTER BE BECAUSE IT IS
IN ANY MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
