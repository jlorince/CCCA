>> Stephen: WOW, THAT IS GOOD STUFF.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THAT.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE DONE THAT.
NOW NATION, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
WE'RE ONLY 19 DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HOLLYWOOD ALLIES ARE ALREADY TRYING TO STEAL IT.
HE'S BEEN ENDORSED BY EVERYONE FROM GEORGE CLOONEY TO NEIL PATRICK HARRIS, TO BEYONCE AND JAY-Z TO LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, ELLEN
DEGENERES AND STEPHEN DE SPIELBERG.
IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE OF DANCING WITH THE STARS BUT WITH STARS.
AND SO FAR, SO FAR, FOLKS, MY MAN MITT JUST HAS CLINT EASTWOOD, DONNIE AND MARIE OS BOND, THE LADY FROM
NORTHERN EXPOSURE AND I WANT TO SAY JOY BEHAR'S OLDER SISTER.
(LAUGHTER) THAT IS WHO THAT IS.
BUT NOW MITT HAS PICKED UP THE BIGGEST ENDORSEMENT OF ALL.
>> THERE IS A SQUIRREL IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHO FOLKS SAY CAN PICK PRESIDENTIAL WINNERS.
FOUR YEARS AGO THEY SET UP TWO BOWLS OF NUTS.
AN OBAMA BOWL AN McCAIN BOWL.
HE PREFERRED THE OBAMA NUTS AND THIS YEAR HE FAVORS ROMNEY NUTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THERE IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, GET USED TO THE TERM PRESIDENT ROMNEY.
HMMMM, HMMMM.
OH THAT LEAVES A REAL TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH.
WHAT IS THAT?
I THINK THAT'S-- THAT'S ROMNEY NUTS.
