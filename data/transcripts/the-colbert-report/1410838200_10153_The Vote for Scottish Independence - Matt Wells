MATT, GUARDIAN, GREAT ENGLISHNEWSPAPER.
DO YOU THINK THAT SCOTLANDSHOULD SECEDE?
>> YES, I THINK SCOTLANDSHOULD SUCCEED AND SECEDE.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THEDIFFERENCE?
>> LOOK, THE UNION HASLASTED 307 YEARS.
AND FOR MUCH OF THAT TIMEIT'S BRITAIN AND SCOTLAND
VERY WELL INDEED.
BUT THE TIES THAT BAND THEUNION TOGETHER THINGS LIKE
THE BRITISH EMPIRE, THE SHAREDSENSE OF BRITISH STATEHOOD THAT
WENT WITH A CENTURY OF FIGHTINGTWO WORLD WARS, THEY HAVE
FADED NOW.
AND THE INSTITUTIONS HAVEREPLACED THEM AND FEEL
DISTANT AND DISCREDITED.
>> Stephen: BUT WILL IT BE GOODFOR EVERYBODY?
FOR THEM TO SECEDE?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IS THAT GOING TOBE POSITIVE FOR SCOTLAND AND
ENGLAND?
>> IT WILL BE VERY GOOD FORSCOTLAND.
AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL BEBAD FOR ENGLAND.
THE GDP OF SCOTLAND IS PERCAPITA $2,300 POUNDS GREATER
THAN IT IS IN ENGLAND.
>> Stephen: IS THAT INMETRIC BECAUSE I DON'T
CONVERT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT ININCHES.
>> SCOTLAND IS A LOWPOPULATION, RESOURCE RICH
COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A GREAT RESOURCES NORTHSEA OIL.
THERE ARE VERY MUCH UNTAPPEDROOT RESOURCES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU WISHDAVID CAMERON HARM?
(LAUGHTER)>> NO.
I MEAN THE GUARDIAN IS APROGRESSIVE LEFT-WING
NEWSPAPER.
>> Stephen: YOU WOULD LIKETO STICK A KNIFE IN HIM.
>> AND WE HAVE -->> Stephen: THAT'S WHY YOU SEE
CHAOS. WOULD THIS BE CHAOS FORTHE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND?
>> I THINK WILL BE DIFFICULT.
>> Stephen: IS THAT ANENGLISH WORD FOR FIREBOMBING
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
DIFFICULT, WHAT DOESDIFFICULT MEAN IN ENGLAND.
>> FRANKLU IT WILL BECATACLYSMIC FOR THEM.
>> Stephen: CATACLYSMIC FORTHEM. SO WANT THIS BECAUSE IT IS
A GOOD STORY FOR YOU.
>> IT WILL BE A GREAT STORY.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE OPEN TOTHE SES SESSION THE SAME
REASON PEOPLE WATCH NASCAR.
>> DAVID CAMERON--
>> Stephen: HOPING THAT THE CARWILL JUST SLAM INTO THE WALL.
YOU'RE CUTTING THE BRABLINGCABLES OF SCOTLAND.
>> DAVID CAMERON STAKED HISREPUTATION ON SAVING THE
UNION.
HE WAS THE ONE WHO GRANTEDTHE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST
PLACE IT WAS HIS DECISION TOMAKE THE SLATE YES OR NO
QUESTION.
>> Stephen: WHY DID HE DOTHAT?
WHY DID HE DO THAT?
>> -- A MASSIVE POLITICALMISCALCULATION WHICH NOW
LOOKS AS IF IT MIGHTBACKFIRE IN HIS FACE.
>> Stephen: WHY DID HE DOIT?
>> BECAUSE AT THE POLLS ATTHE TIME SUGGESTED THAT ONLY
30% OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLANDSUPPORTED INDEPENDENCE.
DAVID CAMERON, IN WHAT SOMEPEOPLE MIGHT SAY WAS
POLITICAL ARROGANCE, THOUGHTTHAT HE COULD EASILY WIN.
THAT THE MASS SERADE RANKS OFTHE THREE POLITICLA PARTIES
WOULD BE UNITED AGAINST THEUPSTART NATIONALISTS.
THEY WOULD BE EASILYDEFEATED.
>> Stephen: COULD THE QUEENHAVE DONE SOMETHING TO STOP
IT?
WHAT IF SHE HAD WORN ADIFFERENT HAT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OR WAVEDSLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY OR
SOMETHING.
>> THE ROLE OF THE QUEEN ISREALLY INTERESTING AND
WHETHER, AN HER VIEWS ASWELL.
>> Stephen: WHERE DOES SHEFALL ON THIS.
>> SHE DID INTERVENE IN THEDEBATE ON SUNDAY COMING OUT
OF CHURCH NEAR HER ESTATE INSCOTLAND WHERE SHE SPENDS
THE SUMMER, BALMORAL.
SHE SAID TO A WELL WISHERWHO ASKED HER WHAT SHE
THOUGHT OF THE SCOTISHREFERENDUM -- A MEMBER OF THE
PUBLIC, OVERHEARD BY THE PRESS-- SHE SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT
THAT SCOTS VOTING ON THURSDAYSHOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY
INDEED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE.
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: THAT IS A SMACKDOWN
FROM THE QUEEN.
THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OFSAYING WELL, DO YOU FEEL
LUCKY, PUNK?
