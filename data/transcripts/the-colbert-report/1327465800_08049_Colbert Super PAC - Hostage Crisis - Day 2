JANUARY 24, 2012, DAY TWO OF
WHAT SOME ARE CALLING THE
COLBERT SUPER PAC HOSTAGE
CRISIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LAST NIGHT I ENDED MY BID TO BE
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
AND I OFFERED TO PAY BACK
COLBERT'S SUPERPAC FROM ITS EVIL
STEP FATHER JON STEWART.
BUT JON REFUSED AND FLEW OFF IN
HIS ZEPPELIN CACKLING.
I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW SCARED MY
MONEY MUST BE RIGHT NOW.
NATION, WON'T YOU COMFORT MY
MONEY BY SECOND IT MORE OF
ITSELF.
GO TO COLBERT SUPER PAC.COM AND
GIVE RECKLESSLY.
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO A NICE ROUND
RIDICULOUS NUM
