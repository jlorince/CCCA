>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, NATION, AS YOU KNOW, I
ALWAYS STRIVE TO BRING YOU THE
LATEST IN NEWS, POLITICS AND
EGYPTOLOGY.
WITH A FOCUS ON THE 18th
DYNASTY.
THAT'S WHY BACK IN JUNE I
BROUGHT YOU THIS BREAKING NEWS
ABOUT KING TUT.
JIM.
AS REPORTED TODAY IN "TIME"
MAGAZINE, WHEN TUT'S MUMMY WAS
FIRST UNWRAPPED IN 1922,
RESEARCHERS REPORTED SEEING THE
BOY-KING'S PENIS.
THEN IN 1968, KING TUT'S PENIS
WAS DECLARED MISSING.
YES.
IT WENT MISSING IN 1968.
NATURALLY SOME HISTORIANS
BELIEVE NIXON APPOINTED IT TO
HIS ADMINISTRATION, BUT IT
TURNED OUT THAT WRINKLED MASS OF
FLESH WAS JUST HENRY KISSINGER.
FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
HELLO, SIR.
BUT NOW A NEW EGYPTIAN MYSTERY
HAS GRABBED FRONT-PAGE
HEADLINES.
SO IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER
INSTALLMENT OF MY AWARD-READY
SERIES "STEPHEN COLBERT'S
MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT
UNKNOWN."
[LIGHTNING CRASHES]
TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT,
TONIGHT, URI GELLER, WHO SOME
MAY REMEMBER AS THE
PARANORMALIST WITH THE POWER TO
BEND SPOONS USING ONLY HIS MIND
AND TRICK SPOONS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, GELLER HAS ENTERED THE NILE
NEWS CYCLE.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
REPORTS THAT GELLER PURCHASED A
SCOTTISH ISLAND BECAUSE
ACCORDING TO SCOTTISH LEGEND A
PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER, ONE PRINCESS
SCOTA, FELL OUT WITH HER FAMILY
AND FLED TO SCOTLAND, BRINGING
WITH HER EGYPTIAN TREASURE.
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
SCOTLAND IS NAMED AFTER PRINCESS
SCOTA IN THE SAME WAY THAT ITALY
IS NAMED AFTER IT.
THERE IT IS.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
KNOWING THIS, URI GELLER HAS
PURCHASED THIS SCOTTISH ISLAND
FOR $46,000, WHICH UNCOVERS A
SECOND MYSTERY.
WHERE DID THE GUY WHO BENDS
SPOONS FOR A LIVING GET $46,000.
NOW, USING HIS MENTAL POWERS,
GELLER RECKONS HE HAS PINPOINTED
THE TREASURE'S LOCATION, AND WE
KNOW HIS MENTAL POWERS ARE
STRONG BECAUSE ACCORDING TO ONE
SCOTTISH LOCAL, BEFORE URI CAME
ALONG, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS
EVER HEARD ABOUT THIS EGYPTIAN
STUFF.
THAT'S RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE INVENTED THE USING ONLY HIS
MIND.
SO WHAT COULD THIS EGYPTIAN
TREASURE BE?
WELL, IT TURNS OUT PRINCESS
SCOTA WAS THE HALF SISTER OF
KING TUT.
OH, MY RA!
COULD IT BE THAT URI GELLER HAS
DISCOVERED THE LOCATION OF
HISTORY'S MOST SOUGHT AFTER
RELIC, KING TUT'S PENIS?
WHICH MEANS THIS IS ACTUALLY
STEPHEN COLBERT'S MYSTERIES OF
THE ANCIENT UNKNOWN, KING TUT'S
PENIS PART TWO, THE
RES-ERECTION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK.
WELCOME BACK.
WELCOME BACK.
NOW IT'S CLEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FACE AT ALL.
WELCOME BACK.
NOW IT'S CLEAR WHY KING TUT'S
SISTER FELL OUT WITH HER ROYAL
FAMILY AND FLED ALL THE WAY TO
SCOTLAND.
IT WASN'T JUST SIBLING RIVALRY.
IT WAS BECAUSE SHE STOLE TUT'S
THROBBING OBELISK.
[CHANTING]
A LITTLE LATE ON THE [MIMICS
CHANTING]
OF COURSE, SCOTLAND IS THE
PERFECT PLACE TO HIDE A
SHRIVELED PENIS.
IT'S SO COLD THERE.
IT WILL FIT RIGHT IN.
SO WILL URI GELLER FINALLY
UNEARTH KING TUT'S MISSING
SCEPTER AND REUNITE IT WITH HIS
ROYAL TOOL?
I'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS
MYSTERY AS IT TAKES SHAPE,
BECAUSE AFTER SEEING WHAT GOAL
KERR DO WITH A SPOON, I HAVE TO
BELIEVE HE CAN DO SOME
