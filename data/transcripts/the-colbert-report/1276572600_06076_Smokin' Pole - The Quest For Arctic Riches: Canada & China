>> WE ARE GOING ALL THE WAY.
TO THE NEXT GAME.
NATION, SOME OF YOU ALREADY KNOW
THIS, BUT SADLY AL AND TIPPER
GORE ARE SEPARATING.
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
THEY SEEMED SO HAPPY.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GLACIERS
STARTED MELTING BECAUSE OF THIS
SMOKING HOT KISS.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I'M A BIG FAN
OF GLOBAL WARMING BECAUSE AS THE
ARCTIC THAW, IT ALLOWS ACCESS TO
TREASURES LIKE TRADE ROUTE,
MINERALS AND NARWHAL MANSERVANT.
THIS IS THE QUESTIONS FOR ARCTIC
RICHES.
FOLKS, SCIENTISTS SAY THIS YEAR
THE ARCTIC DE-ICE IS HEADED FOR
AN ALL-TIME LOW.
WHEW!
SO I'M THE ONLY ONE EXCITED
EVIDENTLY.
NO, NO, DON'T HUMOR ME.
NATION TO, CELEBRATE I GOT THIS
CAKE FROM BASKIN-ROBBINS.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAKE?
OH, ROOM TEMPERATURE CREAM.
THE FIRST COUNTRY CHALLENGING US
FOR THE ARCTIC BEAUTY, CANADA.
FOR YEARS THE NORTH HAS YIELDED
SURPRISES LIKE RICH AGRICULTURAL
LANDS, OIL DEPOSITS AND THE BODY
OF THE FIRST MRS. CLAUS.
YES, KIDS, HE'S REAL.
AND HE'S CRAZY.
BUT NOW THE MELTING ICE IS
UNCOVERING 2,400-YEAR-OLD SPEAR
THROWING TOOLS, 850-YEAR-OLD
BOWS AND ARROWS AND
1,000-YEAR-OLD GROUND SQUIRREL
SNARES.
WE CANNOT LET THESE FALL INTO
THE HANDS OF THE CANADIAN
MILITARY.
FOR THEM A 1,000-YEAR-OLD GROUND
SQUIRREL SNARE IS A HUGE LEAP IN
WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY.
[APPLAUSE]
BUT AN ICE CREAM SPILL.
BUT THE MOST UNEXPECTED TREASURE
CANADIAN SCIENTISTS ARE FINDING
IN THE MELTING PERMAFROST, GREAT
AMOUNTS OF CARIBOU DUNG ALLOWING
THEM AND THEM ALONE TO STUDY THE
ANCIENT D.N.A. PRESERVED IN THAT
DUNG.
THAT'S RIGHT.
CANADA WILL SOON BECOME THE
FOREMOST AUTHORITY ON ANCIENT
CARIBOU DUNG.
THEIR UNIVERSITY DUNG DEPARTMENT
WILL ATTRACT ALL THE TOP DUNG
MINDS, CREATING A HUGE DUNG
BRAIN DRAIN HERE IN AMERICA.
THEN NEXT TIME WE HAVE A DUNG
CRISIS, LET'S GO CRAWLING ON OUR
KNEES TO CANADA FOR HELP.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON YOUR
KNEES IN CANADA.
IT'S COVERED WITH ANCIENT
CARIBOU DUNG.
NEXT UP CHINA.
[GONG]
THANK YOU, JIMMY.
BEIJING IS TRYING TO DIPPERS
CHOPSTICKS IN THE ARCTIC SNOW
SNOW MEIN BY LOBBING FOR
PERMANENT STATUS WITH THE GROUP
COMPRISED OF AMERICA, RUSSIA,
CANADA, THE SCANSD KNAVIAN
COUNTRIES, INYOU WITH IT TRIBES
AND MR. FREEZE, WHO KEEPS
INTRODUCING THE SAME RESOLUTION.
>> ICE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: MR. FREEZE, I SECOND
THAT MOTION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND NOW CHINA IS DECLARING THEIR
INTEREST IN ANTARCTICA.
HEY, AS MUCH AS I WANT TO TRY
SWEET AND SOUR PENGUIN, CHINA
DOESN'T BORDER THE ARCTIC OR THE
ANTARCTIC.
JUST LOOK AT ANY GLOBE.
WHAT THE... MADE IN CHINA.
YOU WIN THIS ROUND, MY GLACIER
MATE.
AND NOW CHINA HAS UPPED THE
ANTE, PURCHASING THE SNOW
DRAGON, THE WORLD'S LARGEST ICE
BREAKER.
BY THE WAY, THE WORLD'S SECOND
LARGEST ICE BREAKER, EVERY
FACTORY IN CHINA.
AND WHY IS CHINA SO HOT FOR OUR
POLLS?
TRADE ROUTES.
>> THE CHINESE HAVE A GREAT
INTEREST IN ALLOWING THEM TO
HAVE SHORTING SHIPPING ROUTES
BETWEEN CHINA AND PARTICULARLY
EUROPE.
>> YES, THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE TO
EUROPE WILL SAVE CHINA BILLIONS
AND BE MUCH EASIER THAN THEIR
PRESENT ROUTE, DIGGING UP TO
FRANCE.
NATION, THOSE TRADE ROUTES AND
THOSE MINERALS ARE OURS.
WE MUST PROTECT THEM TO INCREASE
OUR G.D.P. AND GET OUT OF THIS
RECESSION.
THEN WE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE
GLOBAL ECONOMIC LEADER AND MAYBE
EVEN PAY BACK THE M
