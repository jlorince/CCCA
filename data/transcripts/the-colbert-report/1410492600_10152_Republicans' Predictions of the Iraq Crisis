( LAUGHTER )BUT PERHAPS, PERHAPS THE
PRESIDENT'S FIERCEST CRITIC WASJOHN McCAIN, WHO WAS
EVERYWHERE LAST NIGHT.
HE WAS A GUEST ON CNN.
HE WAS A GUEST ON MSNBC.
HE WAS A GUEST ON FOX NEWS.
HE WAS A SECRET INGREDIENT ON"CHOPPED."
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO INVENTIVE TOPAN FRY HIM WITH A CORN FLAKE
CRUST.
( LAUGHTER )AND McCAIN'S MESSAGE WAS AS
CLEAR AS IT WASSELF-CONGRATULATORY.
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES IS NOW FORCED TO LISTEN
TO WHAT, FRANKLY, LINDSEY GRAHAMAND I HAVE BEEN ARGUING FOR.
OUR WITHDRAWAL FROM ALL OF OURTROOPS FROM IRAQ, WAS A MAJOR
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SITUATIONTHAT WE'RE IN TODAY.
IF WE HAD LEFT A RESIDUAL FORCE,THE SITUATION WOULD NOT BE WHAT
IT IS TODAY.
WE HAD IT WON, THANKS TO THESURGE.
IT WAS WON.
>> Stephen:  YES, IT WAS WON.
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS KEEP ARESIDUAL FORCE IN IRAQ FOR--
LET'S SAY, EVER.
( LAUGHTER )THEN, TODAY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY TERRORISM THERE EXCEPT FORTHE TERRORISM WE HAD WHEN WE
WERE THERE.
( LAUGHTER )PROBLEM-- SAMED.
AND JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT THEONLY ONE THAT BARACK OBAMA
FORGOT TO THANK LAST NIGHT.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"JOURNALED THE REAL MESSAGE OF
OBAMA'S SPEECH SHOULD HAVE BEENDICK CHENEY WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.
SEEING THOSE WORDS IN PRINT MUSTMELT WHATEVER IS IN PLACE OF HIS
HEART.
I'M GOING TO SAY AN EGG TIMERDUCT TAPED TO A FITBIT.
AND, FOLKS, AND, FOLKS, I GOTTASAY--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HUGE, HUGE CHENEY FANS HERETONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )AND IF DICK CHENEY GOT IT RIGHT,
SO DID HIS LITTLEBUDDY-IN-CHIEF --
WHO GOT IT RIGHT BEFORE THESURGE IN 2007.
>> PRESIDENT BUSH ISSUED THISFRIGHTENINGLY ACCURATE, AS IT
TURNS OUT, ASSESSMENT OF WHATWOULD HAPPEN.
>> WE BEGIN WITHDRAWING BEFOREOUR COMMANDERS TELL US WE ARE
READY WOULD BE DANGEROUS FORIRAQ, FOR THE REGION, AND FOR
THE UNITED STATES.
IT WOULD MEAN SURRENDERING THEFUTURE OF AL-- OF IRAQ TO
AL QAEDA.
IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE'D BERISKING MASS KILLINGS ON A
HORRIFIC SCALE.
IT WOULD MEAN INCREASING THEPROBABILITY THAT AMERICAN TROOPS
WOULD HAVE TO RETURN AT SOMELATERIDATE DATE TO CONFRONT AN
ENEMY THAT IS EVEN MOREDANGEROUS.
>> HOW EERIE.
>> Stephen:  YES.
HOW EERIE.
IT'S LIKE HE'S SOME KIND OFPROPHET.
WHAT'S THAT GUY'S NAME.
NOSTRA-DUMBASS.
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S IT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
HE SAW IS COMING.
BECAUSE IT REALLY EYE GOTTA SAY,LISTENING TO THAT, IT REALLY
SEEMS AS IF BUSH COULD SEE THEFUTURE IN 2007.
IF ONLY HE COULD HAVE SEEN IT IN2003.
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD, FOLKS!
IF HIS PREDICTIONS WERE RIGHTABOUT THIS, THAT MEANS HIS
PREDICTIONS WERE RIGHT ABOUTEVERYTHING.
>> I ASK YOU TO PASS LEGISLATIONTO PROHIBIT THE MOST EGREGIOUS
ABUSES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,CREATING HUMAN-ANIMAL HYBRIDS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, FOLKS, DOYOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
I AM NOW PREDICTING THAT AFTERTHIS WAR, THE NEW PRIME MINISTER
OF IRAQ WILL BE A PRIMEMINITTOR.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
