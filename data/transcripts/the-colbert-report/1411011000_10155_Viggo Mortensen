I'M READY TO GO.
>> WELL, THIS MOVIE DOESHARKEN BACK TO A BYGONE ERA
WHEN MEN HAD TO DRINK A LOTOF ALCOHOL BEFORE THEY WOULD
GET NAKED IN FRONT OF ONEANOTHER.
SO I THINK AFTER A FEWDRINKS WE COULD SHOW EACH
OTHER OUR KNIVES, I THINK.
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU PLAY ACONMAN.

CONMAN DOESN'T SOUND GOOD?

WITH EVERYTHING.

GETTING NAKED.
I'M GETTING THERE, I'MGETTING THERE.
OR AT LEAST IMAGINING A KNIFEFIGHT.

>> Stephen: AFTER ACTING FORSO MANY YEARS, DO YOU KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANY MORE?

TIME.

SO PLAYING A CONMAN WAS KINDOF LIKE TYPE CASTING, REALLY.
>> Stephen: THE OTHER THINGSTHAT YOU DO THE POETRY, THE
MUSIC, THE ART, THEPHOTOGRAPHY, WHY DO THAT?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MUCH MOREWORK THAN ACTING IS BECAUSE
THAT INVOLVES ACTUALLYHAVING TO PRODUCE A PHYSICAL
THING THAT YOU GIVE TOSOMEONE WHEREAS ACTING YOU
CAN GO IN THERE, YOU REFLECTLIGHT AND YOU'RE HALFWAY
THERE.
WHY WOULD YOU-- WHAT IS IT,WHAT IS IT ABOUT THOSE OTHER
THINGS THAT ATTRACT YOU WHENYOU HAVE ALREADY GOT THE
STARDOM?
>> I'M INSECURE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU REALLY?
>> A LOT OF ACTORS ARE.
>> NO, I'M RESTLESS.

LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN.

TO-- DO YOU, CAN YOU?
I CAN, I COULD, I COULD, IJUST DON'T LIKE TO SHOW OFF
BY READING.
