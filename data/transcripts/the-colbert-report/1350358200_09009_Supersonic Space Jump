>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SOP MUCH.
I'M NOT SURE, I'M SO THRILLED BY THAT OVATION BUT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU ARE ACTUALLY CLAPPING FOR ME OR
JUST TRYING TO SHAKE ALL THE RAIN OFF YOUR ARMS.
BUT FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME.
I LOVE SEEING MANKIND OVERCOME OBSTACLES.
THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS PUSHING CHAIRS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) AND YESTERDAY, ANOTHER BARRIER FELL AS DAREDEVIL FELIX BAUMGARTNER BECAME THE FIRST MAN TO-- AAAAHHHH--
(LAUGHTER) FELIX BAUMGARTNER BECAME THE FIRST MAN TO BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER IN FREEFALL.
PARACHUTING FROM A RECORD ALTITUDE OF 24 MILES.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS PROVES THAT OUR DAYS OF HUMAN EXPLORATION ARE NOT OVER.
BECAUSE WE DID IT!
WE PUT A MAN ON THE EARTH!
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S A BRAVE SAME WORLD.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD TUNED IN TO WITNESS THIS HISTORIC EVENT AND OR HIDEOUSLY GRUESOME DEATH.

IT'S PERFECT SYNERGY.
RED BULL GIVES YOU WINGS.

FOLKS, WE NEED MORE PRIVATE COMPANIES STEPPING UP TO EXPLORE THE KNOWN UNIVERSITY.
