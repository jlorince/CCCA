>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
I HAVE ACTUALLY NEVER HAD AN
AUDIENCE, I HAVE NEVER IN
ALL MY BORN DAYS HAD AN
AUDIENCE CHANT THE WORD
"STEVE"
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THAT'S A LITTLE
FAMILIAR.
NATION, YOU KNOW ME.
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY
PANIC BUT FUR'S NOT
CURRENTLY PANICKING THAT IS
REASON ENOUGH TO FREAK OUT.
BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS UNDER
CONSTANT THREAT FROM
TERRORISTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHO, BUT
SOMEONE KEEPS DUMPING
SUSPICIOUS WHITE POWDER ON
MY LAWN EVERY WINTER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: LUCKILY, FOLK,
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY IS HARD AT WORK
KEEPING US SAFE, ESPECIALLY
THE TERRORIST'S NUMBER ONE
TARGET, WESTERN MICHIGAN IT
IS LIKE A MITTEN OF DEATH
POINTED RIGHT AT THE HEART
OF SOUTHERN ONTARIO.
AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS
YOU KNOW WOULD LOVE NOTHING
MORE THAN TO ATTACK BATTLE
CREEK AND TAKE OUT OUR
STRATEGIC RESERVE OF FROOTED
LOOPS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, LUCKILY,
HOMELAND SECURITY HAS
PROVIDED AMPLE FUNDING TO
PROTECT THE TERRIFIED
RESIDENTS OF THE WOLVERINE
STATE.
FOR MORE, WE TURN TO FOX
NEW'S SENIOR ANCHOR WITH
PLAY MOBILE HAIR, BRETT
BAIER.
>> 13 COUNTIES IN THE REGION
HAVE RECEIVED $900 SNO-CONE
MACHINES COURTESY OF A
HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT.
LOCAL MEDIA REFERENCES STATE
DOCUMENT CLAIMING THE
MACHINES HAVE A VARIETY OF
USES, AMONG THEM MAKING ICE
TO TREAT INJURES.
AND PREVENT HEAT RELATED
ILLNESSES DURING
EMERGENCIES.
AND TO PROVIDE SNO-CONES
DURING PROMOTIONAL EVENTS.
>> Stephen: SNO-CONES!
TAKE THAT AL QAEDA!
YOU SEE, AL QAEDA'S FROM THE
DESERT.
THEY'VE GOT NO DEFENSE
AGAINST SNOW, ESPECIALLY IN
CONE FORM.
BUT THE SOFT ON TERROR-CRATS
ARE MISCHARACTERIZING THESE
MACHINES AS A FRIVOLOUS
WASTE OF TAX MONEY SO LOCAL
MICHIGAN OFFICIAL DAVID
FELDSPAUSCH SET THE RECORD
STRAIGHT, QUOTE.
I DON'T LIKE THE TERM
SNO-CONE MACHINES BECAUSE IT
SOUNDS HORRIBLE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS AN
ICED SHAVING MACHINE AND ITS
PURPOSE, IT MAKES A LITTLE
MORE SENSE.
YES, IT IS NOT A SNO-CONE
MACHINE T IS AN ICED SHAVING
MACHINE.
JUST LIKE THAT EXCUSE ISN'T
BULL [BLEEP], IT'S NIGHT
RATE RICH BUDGET FERTILIZER.
HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE
DEFENDING THIS VITAL
EXPENDITURE.
FOR MORE WE TURN TO WOOD-8
WESTERN MICHIGAN'S FINEST
NEWS SOURCE.
>> THE JUSTIFICATION FOR
BUYING THE SNO-CONE MAKERS
IS MEDICAL RATHER THAN
RECOGNIZE
VACATION-- RECREATIONAL.
>> IT DOES PROVIDE A MEANS
FOR ICE PACKS FOR RESPONDERS,
FOR VOLUNTEERS TO STAY
HYDRATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY
THAN JUST BOTTLED WATER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
IT COULD SUPPLY FIRST
RESPONDERS WITH MUCH NEEDED
WATER AND JUST AS IMPORTANT
LEER, MUCH NEEDED
BANANA-BERRY FLAVOURING.
AND FOLKS, THAT'S NOT ALL IT
DOES.
>> LOCAL EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT AGENCIES CAN ALSO
USE THE SNO-CONE MACHINES AS
AN ATTRACTION AT PUBLIC
EVENTS WHEN THEY ARE TRYING
TO ATTRACT VOLUNTEERS.
>> Stephen: YES.
IT IS AN ATTRACTION FOR
VOLUNTEERS.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RISK YOUR
LIFE BATTLING TERRORISTS FOR
NO MONEY?
WHAT IF I OFFERED YOU A
SNO-CONE?
HUH?
NICE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IF ANYTHING, FOLKS T IS TIME
TO MAKE MORE OF THESE
PURCHASES.
THERE IS NO REASON THAT
FIGHTING TERROR CAN'T BE
FUN.
AS LONG AS YOU FRAME IT
PROPERLY.
FOR INSTANCE, THIS IS NOT A
COTTON CANDY MACHINE, IT IS
A HIGH-SPEED SUCROSE
CENTRIFUGE.
THAN MAY LOOK LIKE A WATER
SLIDE BUT IT IS REALLY A
HIGH DRAWALLICALLY ACTUATED
LOW FRICTION BODY TRANSPORT.
THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO
DELIVER FIRST RESPONDERS TO
THE INJURED IF THEY HAPPEN
TO BE IN THE SPLASH POOL.
AND THIS IS NOT A BOUNCEY
CASTLE T IS AN INFLATABLE
BOUNCEY GITMO, WHICH CAN BE
USED TO DETAIN ENEMY
COMBATANTS.
FIRST WE LOAD THEM UP WITH
COTTON CANDY AND THEN WE
MAKE THEM FEEL BARFY IN THE
TUM TUM.
