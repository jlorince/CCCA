FOLKS, I WANT TO WISH YOU ALL AMERRY SOONER MONDAY!
AND FOR ANY NON-CHRISTIANVIEWERS.
HAPPY ROBOT CHANUKAH.
NOW, I SPENT MY CYBER MONDAYCYBERRING ON amazon.com
BECAUSE I LOVE THEIR OVERNIGHTDELIVERY SERVICE.
I LIKE TO SNUGGLE UNDER THECOVERS WITH THE HAPPY THOUGHT
THAT IN THE NEXT THREE HOURS MYNEW THREE-SPEED CAN OPENER WILL
MOVE TO A DIFFERENT WAREHOUSE.
AMAZON'S OVERNIGHT DELIVERY OFSUCH ITEMS AS 15 FOOT
TRAMPOLINES AND $25,000 84 INCHTELEVISIONS HAS ONE FATAL FLAW.
IT TAKES FOREVER!
(LAUGHTER)IF I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW
FOR MY ITEMS TO ARRIVE THEREGOES TONIGHT'S PLANS TO WATCH
"MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL" WHILEDOING BACK FLIPS ON MY
TRAMPOLINE.
(LAUGHTER)FORTUNATELY, AMAZON C.E.O. AND
BILLIONAIRE BUSYTOWN WORM JEFFBEZOS --
(LAUGHTER).
HE GETS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEMAND IS HE'S DOING SOMETHING TO
SOLVE IT.
>> THESE ARE OCTOCOPTERS.
THESE ARE EFFECTIVELY TKREPB BUSTHERE'S NO REASONS THEY CAN'T BE
USED AS DELIVERY VEHICLES.
WE CAN DO HALF HOUR DELIVERY.
>> HALF HOUR TKHR +EUFLY.
>> AND WE CAN CARRY OBJECTS UPTO FIVE POUNDS WHICH COVERS 86%
OF THE ITEMS THAT WE DELIVER.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THESEAMAZON DRONES ARE A GREAT IDEA.
AND GUARANTEED TO BE SAFE THANKSTO ALL THE DRONE TESTING WE'VE
DONE OVERSEAS!
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, WORST-CASE SCENARIO, A
FEW HOMES GET CARPET GIFTED WITHSOME COLLATERAL GENEROSITY.
BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR HOWSIMPLE IT IS WHEN THERE'S THIS
CAREFULLY-PRODUCED SHORT FILMFROM AMAZON.
THERE'S THE DRONE PICKING UP THEPACKAGE AND FLYING OUT OF THE
WAREHOUSE NAVIGATING THROUGH THEPARTS OF AMERICA WITH NO TREES,
PHONE LINES, OR BUILDINGS THENLANDING ON YOUR DOORSTEP WHILE
YOUR FAMILY COWERS INSIDE UNTILAFTER THE SEMIAUTONOMOUS BLADE
WIELDING OCTOCOPTER LEAVES.
YES, NATION, FLYING PRODUCTS TOOUR DOORSTEP INSIDE OF HALF AN
HOUR IS A BOLD PLAN RIGHT OUT OFSCIENCE FICTION.
IT LEAVES MY WITH ONLY ONEQUESTION: WHY DOES IT TAKE SO
LONG?
I WANT MY STUFF NOW!
AND I KNOW HOW TO GET IT.
SO PUT ON YOUR FUTURE HAT, JEFFBEZOS BECAUSE I'VE COOKED UP AN
IDEA THAT WILL BRING BUYING ASWE KNOW IT TO A NEW LEVEL.
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURETHIS.
I'M GOING TO KEEP MY EYES OPENBECAUSE I HAVE TO READ THESE
WORDS HERE BUT EVERYBODY ELSE,HERE'S THE IDEA.
AMAZON LOCATIONS THAT CUSTOMERSCAN WALK INTO AND BUY THINGS!
(LAUGHTER)AND THE INVENTORY WOULD BE
ARRANGED NOT AS DROPDOWN MENUSBUT ROWS OF PHYSICAL MERCHANDISE
A CUSTOMER CAN ACTUALLY TOUCH!
AND INSTEAD OF WAITING PRECIOUSMINUTES FOR A DRONE TO ARRIVE
THEY CAN PLACE THEIR SELECTIONSINTO A WHEELED BASKET
CONVEYANCE.
IT'S INSPIRED BY YOUR WEB SITE'SABSTRACT CART GRAPHIC.
(LAUGHTER)THUS, THEY HAVE THE PRODUCTS
INSTANTLY.
I CALL IT AMAZON LIVE.
CALL ME, BEZOS.
YOUR MONEY AND MY IDEA WE CANHAVE THESE SPENDING HABIT
OPPORTUNITY PLACES-- OR SHOPS,AS I CALL THEM-- UP AND RUNNING
BY 2025.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
