YOUR MAGAZINE AND TALKING ABOUT
IT.
NICE TRY.
YOU SEE, I'M NOT A GUY WHO JUST
BUYS WHATEVER THE LATEST HYPE
IS.
NO, I'M WAITING FOR THE NEXT
HYPE TO COME OUT BECAUSE THAT'S
GOING TO BE GREAT.
I HEAR IT HAS BLUETOOTH.
SO NATURALLY I ALSO REJECT THE
LAMESTREAM MEDIA HYPE THAT THE
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CANNOT GET
ANYTHING DONE.
>> CONGRESS IS TOTALLY
DYSFUNCTIONAL.
>> THE HOUSE HAS BECOME A PRETTY
DYSFUNCTIONAL PLACE.
THE RIGHT WING TEA PARTY CROWD
IN THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS

>> THE SITUATION ON CAPITOL HILL
IS DIRE.
CONGRESS DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
AND IT CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.
>> Stephen: BILL, I AM
DISAPPOINTED.
HOW CAN THE HOUSE BE EXPECTED TO
GET ANYTHING DONE WHEN MANY OF
THE BILLS THEY VOTE ON DON'T
EVEN REPEAL OBAMA CARE?
FOR INSTANCE, TAKE THE
IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL.
IT IS GOING NOWHERE IN THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE IT IS
FULL OF PROBLEMS.
SURE, IT MASS I HAVE BEENLY
INCREASES SECURITY ON THE
MEXICAN BORDER, BUT AS VIRGINIA
REPRESENTATIVE AND NORDSTROM
MAKE-UP COUNTER VICTIM, BOB
GOODLATTE POINTS OUT, THE BILL
OVERLOOKED THE NEED FOR BORDER
AGENTS IN THE INTERIOR OF OUR
COUNTRY.
YES, YES, THANK YOU.
OUR INTERIOR BORDERS ARE
DEFENSELESS.
AND WHEN...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
CONGRESSMAN, THEY ARE APPLAUDING
FOR YOU.
WHEN WILL WE BUILD THE BORDER
WALL WITH FLORIDA?
WE CANNOT LET...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE CANNOT LET THOSE MANIACS INTO
OUR COUNTRY.
IT IS LEGAL TO SHO
