QUELL COME BACK.
WE'RE CONTINUING OUR
CONVERSATION WITH U.N.
AMBASSADOR SUSAN WRIGHT.
NOW AMBASSADOR, OKAY, BEFORE
THE COMMERCIAL BREAK YOU
MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE
U.N. SERVES A PURPOSE.
(LAUGHTER)
ASSUMING THAT IT DOES, LET'S
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT THE U.N. IS
DOING RIGHT NOW AND SOME OF
THE THINGS THAT THE UNITED
STATES HAS ASKED THE U.N.
FOR ITS HELP WITH.
OKAY ARE.
WE STILL AT WAR WITH LIBYA
BECAUSE I DON'T HEAR MUCH
ABOUT IT ANY MORE.
IS THAT STILL GOING ON?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YES.
BUT CAD AVI'S DAYS ARE
NUMBERED.
I THINK IF YOU ARE PAYING
CLOSE ATTENTION YOU WILL SEE
THAT THE NATO OPERATION HAS
BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE.
FIRST IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
IT SAVED TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF LIVES THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN LOST HAD QADDAFI BEEN
ABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS PLANS
TO ATTACK HIS PEOPLE LIKE
RATS, AS HE CALLED THEM, IN
EASTERN LIBYA, PARTICULARLY
IN BENGHAZI.
SO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED.
>> Stephen: LET'S SAY THAT
GOING INTO LIBYA WAS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE, I'M
GOING TO ACCEPT YOUR
ARGUMENT.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE, WHAT
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
LIBYA AND SYRIA?
AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LIBYA AND SYRIA?
BECAUSE I GET THOSE TWO
MIXED UP.
>> ONE IS ON THE NORTH COAST
OF AFRICA.
THE OTHER IS ON THE
MEDITERRANEAN ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
>> Stephen: DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES.
BUT BOTH OF THEM HAVE BAD
SITUATIONS.
THE GOVERNMENT IS KILLING
PEOPLE IN SYRIA.
WHY AREN'T WE SENDING, YOU
KNOW, OUR BRAVE DRONES IN
THERE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SYRIA
IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS AND
APPALLING.
AND WE SAW OVER THE LAST FEW
DAYS SYRIAN WAR BOATS
WARSHIPS SHOOTING AT THEIR
OWN PEOPLE IN THE MAIN PORT
CITY.
AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY
CLEAR THAT A SAAD HAS BEEN
ABSOLUTE-- ASSAD HAS BEEN
IMMORAL AND REP RI HENCEABLE
IN HIS ACTIONS.
LET ME FEBRUARY YOU WERE, I
KNOW IT IS CONFUSING BUT LET
ME WALK YOU THROUGH IT.
WE HAVE AN AMBAR DOES IN
SYRIA, ROBERT FORD WHO HAS
BEEN VERY BRAVE AND OUT ON
THE STREETS WITH THE
PROTESTORS AND TALKING TO
REGULAR SYRIANS.
AND WHAT HE HEARS EVERY DAY
AND WHAT THEY WANT FROM THE
UNITED STATES IS MORAL
LEADERSHIP, POLITICAL
PRESSURE AND SANCTIONS.
BUT VERY CLEARLY, NO
MILITARY INTERVENTION.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK
FINALLY HERE ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN SAM ALLIA.
AND-- SOMALIA.
IT IS A HUMANITARIAN
TRAGEDY.
BUT YOU KNOW, KEEP IT LIGHT.
WHAT IS--
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHAT
CAN PEOPLE DO TO HELP.
>> STEPHEN THERE IS NO
KEEPING THIS ONE LIGHT.
THERE ARE OTHER 12 MILLION
PEOPLE THAT AT RISK OF
STARVATION IN SOMALIA AND
THE BROADER HORN OF AFRICA,
MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.
AND THIS IS A COMBINATION OF
A RESULT OF AN OPPRESSIVE
DROUGHT AND THE HORRIFIC
ACTIONS OF THE TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION CALLED AL
SHABAB WHICH HAS PREVENTED
ASSISTANCE TO BE AVAILABLE
TO ITS PEOPLE OVER THE
COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS.
THE UNITED STATES IS TAKING
THIS EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT THEY CAN DO RIGHT NOW.
SORRY, THEY DID TEXT AID TO
27722 AND THEY CAN GIVE $10
DIRECTLY TO THE U.N.'S WORLD
FOOD PROGRAM.
>> RIGHT.
>> AND THAT'S A VERY
IMPORTANT WAY FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO
CONTRIBUTE ON AN INDIVIDUAL
BASIS.
>> LET ME ASK YOU THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS
WITH YOUR DIPLOMATIC PLATE
WHAT IS THE CRAZIEST PLACE
YOU'VE EVER PARKED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I LIKE TO JUST DRIVE UP
ON THE CURB AND GET TO WHERE
I NEED TO GO.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
ARE YOU ANY RELATIONSHIP TO
CONDOLEEZZA RICE.
>> NOT THAT YOU I AM AWARE
OF.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
I AM TOLD THAT YOU ARE AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
I DON'T SEE RACE.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND
I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I
ENDORSED RICK PERRY.
>> ARE YOU WHITE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE.
TEXT AID TO 27722.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
