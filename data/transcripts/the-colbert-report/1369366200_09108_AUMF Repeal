( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
I'M STEPHEN COLBERT.
YOUR LOVE IS LIKE A VACATION.
FOLKS, I'VE GOT A CONFESSION TO
MAKE-- I'M NO FAN OF BARACK
OBAMA.
THERE, I SAID IT.
SOMEBODY HAD TO.
BUT I AM A FAN OF HOW HE'S
HANDLED THE WAR ON TERROR BY
FOLLOWING THE EXACT SAME
POLICIES LAID OUT BY PRESIDENT
BUSH.
BUSH.
( LAUGHTER )
WHO FOLLOWED THE EXACT SAME
POLICIES LAID OUT BY.  CHENEY,
PARTICULARLY HIS FLYING DEATHBOT
PROGRAM WHICH HAVE SOME
CRITICIZED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
USED TO KILL AMERICANS OVERSEAS.
BUT IT'S VERY LIMITED IN ITS
SCOPE IN THAT ONLY AN INFORMED,
HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
CAN ORDER YOUR DEATH.
( LAUGHTER )
SECRETARY OF STATE, DEFINITELYE
NO LOWER THAN THE POSTMASTER
GENERAL.
( LAUGHTER )
WHICH I ASSUME MEANS NO MORE
KILLING ON SATURDAYS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGAL
THANKS TO A 2001 CONGRESSIONAL
RESOLUTION CALLED "THE
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF
MILITARY FORCE" OR A.U.M.F.
SO-CALLED, BECAUSE IT IS WHAT
GIVES OBAMA'S UNCHECKED KILLING
AUTHORITY THAT SPECIAL OOMPH.
NOW, HERE--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
RIGHT HERE.
IS-- THIS IS  HE ACTUAL
RESOLUTION, A SVELTE 60 WORDS OF
ETERNAL WAR-JUSTIFYING
DELICIOUSNESS.
HERE WE GO.
"BE IT RESOLVED THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS  UTHORIZED TO USE
ALL NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE
FORCE AGAINST THOSE NATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, OR PERSONS HE
DETERMINES PLANNED, AUTHORIZED,
COMMITTED OR AIDED THE TERRORIST
ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED SEPTEMBER
11, 2001 OR HARBORED SUCH
ORGANIZATIONS OR PERSONS IN
ORDER TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE ACTS
OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES BY
SUCH NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, OR
PERSONS."
FOLKS, THIS IS THE MOST
BEAUTIFULLY SWEEPING, KNEE-JERK
DECLARATION OF VENGEFUL FURY
SINCE FDR. SAID AFTER PEARL
HARBOR.
THIS IS A DATE THAT WILL LIVE IN
INFAMY.
HEY, TOGO, I DON'T NEED TO STAND
UP TO PUT MY BOOT UP YOUR ASS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND, FOLKS, THIS UNLIMITED POWER
TO WAGE WAR WHEREVER IS THE
RESULT OF A CAREFUL,
DELIBERATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE
AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS,
CONGRESS TOOK AN ENTIRE SEVEN
DAYS TO PASS IT.
THAT'S LONGER THAN IT TOOK GOD
TO MAKE HEAVEN AND EARTH.
( LAUGHTER )
INCIDENTALLY, HEAVEN AND EARTH--
THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE THE
PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZED TO KILL
PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )
DON'T TRY HIDING BEHIND THAT
GATE, ST. PETER.
WE HAVE INTELE THAT PUTS YOU IN
THE MIDDLE EAST 2,000 YEARS AGO.
CLEARLY, IT IS A GREAT
RESOLUTION, WHICH IS WHY I WAS
SO DISAPPOINT THE BY A MAJOR
POLICY SPEECH THE PRESIDENT GAVE
TODAY AT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE
UNIVERSITY-- GREAT FOOTBALL
TEAM, BY THE WAY.
THEIR DEFENSIVE LINE IS F-14s.
( LAUGHTER )
AND IN HIS SPEECH, OBAMA
ANNOUNCED HE IS READY TO GIVE UP
ALL THAT POWER.
>> THE A.U.M.F. IS NOW NEARLY 12
YEARS OLD.
THINKING, OUR DEFINITIONS, OUR
ACTIONS, WE MAY CONTINUE TO
GRANT PRESIDENTS UPBOUND POWERS
MORE SUITED TOWARDS TRADITIONAL
ARMED CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATION
STATES.
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
IN EFFORTS TO REFINE AND
ULTIMATELY REPEAL THE A.U.M.F.
MANDATE.
>> Stephen:  THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO REPEAL THE SOURCE OF
HIS POWER.
THAT'S LIKE RYAN GOSLING
REPEALING HIS ABS.
OR MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY REPEAL
HIS ABS.
( LAUGHTER )
OR ME REPEALING MY POWER TO NAME
PEOPLE WITH ABS.
LAUGH AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SOME IN CONGRESSMENT TO HELP HIM
DO IT.
>> I'M CONVINCED THAT IF WE DO
NOT REPEAL THIS AUTHORIZATION TO
USE FORCE THAT I VOTED AGAINST
IN 2001, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE
STATE OF PERPETUAL WAR FOREVER.
>> HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY SQUARE
THIS WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT--
OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE
CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO
DECLARE WAR?
>> Stephen:  OH, GREAT!
LET'S PUT CONGRESS IN CHARGE OF
THE WAR ON TERROR.
HEY, WE HAVE AL QAEDA NUMBER ONE
IN OURSITIS?
DO WE HIT HIM WITH A DRONE?
THREE MONTHS OF SUBCOMMITTEE
HEARINGS LATER HE'S STILL ON THE
LOOSE BUT ACKNOWLEDGE HAS
NAMESLET AYMAN AL ZAWAHIRI POST
OFFICE.
>> IF ANYTHING I SAY THE
A.U.M.F. IS TOO RESTRICTIVE
BECAUSE THE RESOLUTION SAYS
YOU'VE GOT TO LINK THE
TERRORISTS YOU'RE KILLING TO
9/11.
SO FAR THAT HAS NOT BEEN A
PROBLEM THANKS TIE HIGH-LEVEL
C.I.A. TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS SIX
DEGREES OF GUYS WHO DON'T EAT
BACON.
( LAUGHTER )
FOR INSTANCE, HERE IS HOW WE
JUSTIFIED-- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T
EAT BACON, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW THAT?
I'M NOT GIVING AWAY STATE
SECRETS THERE.
HERE'S HOW WE JUSTIFIED DRONE
STRIKES IN YEMEN.
YEMEN.
LEMON.
LEMON LIME.
7 AND 7.
711
9/11.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
PERFECTLY LEGAL.
BUT, FOLKS, THERE MAY COME A DAY
WHEN WE CAN'T LINK SOMEONE TO
9/11.
OKAY, ANOTHER DAY.
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU.
LAYOFF LAUGH THAT'S WHY I'M WITH
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR AND AUNT
WHO GIVES YOU THE SAME POLO
SHIRT EVERY YEAR, LINDSEY
GRAHAM.
>> WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE
A.U.M.F. ANEW.
WE NEED TO BROADEN THE ABILITY
TO GO AFTER THE ENEMY BECAUSE
IT'S CHANGING DAY BY DAY, BUT WE
NEED TO DO SO WITHIN THE VALUES
OF BEING AN AMERICAN.
>> Stephen:  YES, INSTEAD OF
REPEALING THE A.U.M.F., WE MUST
BROAD BROADEN THE PRESIDENT'S
WAR POWERS IN A WAY THAT IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES
ENSCHIEPPED IN OUR CONSTITUTION.
AS MADISON WROTE IN ARTICLE 3
YIPPEE KI-YAY, ( BLEEP ).
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I MEAN, WHY STOP AT
REMOVING SEPTEMBER 11?
I MEAN, I THINK-- I'LL AUTHORIZE
ANYTHING THAT MOVES!
ALL RIGHT, TAKE OUT SEPTEMBER
11.
THAT THING CAN GO.
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER
THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT.
FOR INSTANCE, NECESSARY.
APPROPRIATE.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WEARING
WHITE PANTS AFTER LABOR DAY.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, THAT CAN GO.
AND WE DON'T NEED THAT.
AND I THINK THAT'S DONE.
THAT'S REDUNDANT.
THAT'S OLD.
THIS IS GONE.
THAT'S OUT.
THAT'S OUT.
THAT'S OUT.
THAT'S OUT.
THAT'S OUT.
OKAY.
THIS IS ALL YOU NEED.
THE PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZED TO
USE ALL FORCE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE LESS-- A
LITTLE LESS YAKKETY-YAK.
A MORE ATTACKETY-TACK.
THIS IS SHORT ENOUGH TO TWEET.
