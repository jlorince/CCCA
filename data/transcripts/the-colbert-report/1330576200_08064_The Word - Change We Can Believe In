(LAUGHTER)
IT WILL BE GOOD FOR US.
OF COURSE, ONCE ROMNEY IS THE
NOMINEE, HE IS GOING TO FACE
ALLOUT CLASS WARFARE, FOLKS, AND
IT'S ALL BARACK OBAMA'S FAULT.
WITH HIS PLAN TO ELIMINATE THE
BUSH TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY,
COMRADE BARRY HERE IS PITTING
RICH AGAINST POOR.
LUCKILY THE POOR AREN'T BUYING
IT.
AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ACCORDING
TO A NEW POLL BY THE
CONGRESSIONAL NEWSPAPER "THE
HILL," 75% OF AMERICANS THINK
THE WEALTHY SHOULD PAY 30% OR
LESS IN TAXES.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS, RICH PEOPLE.
WE GOT THE POOR IN THE PALM OF
OUR HANDS.
WHICH REMINDS ME...
(LAUGHTER).
DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'VE BEEN.
AND, FOLKS, I THINK THE WORKING
CLASS ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE
THEY KNOW IT'S IN THEIR OWN
SELF-INTEREST AND FOX NEWS
ANALYST CHARLIE GASPARINO KNOWS
WHY.
>> MOST WORKING CLASS PEOPLE
REALIZE THAT THE MORE YOU TAKE
FROM THE RICH, THE LESS IT KIND
OF TRICKLES BACK TO THEM.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS PEOPLE WANT
MORE OF THEIR INCOME, THEY SPEND
MORE.
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WORK.
THEY ARE DISHWASHERS, THEY ARE
BAR TENNERS.
PEOPLE THAT DRIVE CABS WANT KNOW
TIP THEM.
FOR A REASON.
I TIP EVERYBODY.
I GET A HAIR CUT FOR $15, I ADD
A $5 TIP.
THAT'S A LOT.
>> OKAY.
SO YOU ACTUALLY TIP THE PERSON
WHO...
>> I ACTUALLY TIP MY BARTENDERS
VERY WELL.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YES, CHARLIE
GASPARINO TIPS HIS BARTENDERS
VERY WELL.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THEY EARN THAT MONEY.
THEY HAVE TO SPEND ALL NIGHT
LISTENING TO A DRUNK CHARLIE
GASPARINO.
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS, FOLKS...
(APPLAUSE).
WHEN WE RICH HAVE LOWER TAXES,
WE SPEND MORE AND THE POOR
BENEFIT IN THE FORM OF TIPS.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
LET'S SAY I'M A HEDGE FUND GUY
AND I TAKE HOME $27 MILLION.
EARNED EVERY PENNY.
NOW, IF MY TAXES... ARE LOW,
WHEN I GO OUT TO EAT I THROW THE
WAITRESS A COUPLE OF BUCKS.
I'M HAPPY; SHE'S PAID TO SEEM
HAPPY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IF PRESIDENT OBAMA CHANGES
MY MARGINAL TAX RATE, INSTEAD OF
$27 MILLION, MAYBE I'M BRINGING
HOME ONLY $25 MILLION.
AND IF THAT HAPPENS THE FIRST
THING THAT ME, CAVUTO AND
CHARLIE GASPARINO ARE GOING TO
DO IS PUNISH THE WAITRESS!
WE CAN'T AFFORD THE $13 NOW.
HELL, WE MIGHT HAVE TO DINE AND
DASH.
SO THANKS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA THE
WAITRESS CAN'T MAKE A LIVING AND
HAS TO TURN TO A LIFE OF
PROSTITUTION.
INCIDENTALLY, PROSTITUTION,
GREAT TIPS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW WE HAVE GOT... I SAY TO HELP
AMERICA, TO BRING THIS THIS
ECONOMY BACK, TO HELP THE
WORKING POOR WE'VE GOT TO DO
JUST THE OPPOSITE.
LET'S CUT RICH PEOPLE'S TAXES
COMPLETELY BECAUSE IF WE DO IT
LOGICALLY FOLLOWS THAT DOING SO
WILL MAKE US RICH PEOPLE SO
GENEROUS THAT WORKING FOLKS CAN
EARN THEIR ENTIRE INCOME FROM
TIPS-- AS THEY SHOULD.
IN FACT, A NEW BILL IN FLORIDA
WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO PAY
TIPPED WORKERS A LOWER MINIMUM
WAGE.
FROM $4.65 DOWN TO $2.13 AN
HOUR.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
THERE'S NO PROBLEM THERE!
FLORIDA IS KNOWN FOR ITS
GENEROUS TIPPERS.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, THE ELDERLY KNOW WHAT A
YOUNG PERSON NEEDS TO SURVIVE IN
1945.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, REMEMBER, THIS WAS
VERY IMPORTANT, EMPLOYERS, YOU
CAN PAY $2.13 AN HOUR ONLY TO
TIPPED WORKERS SO OBVIOUSLY
EVERYONE SHOULD NOW BE A TIPPED
WORKER.
FOR INSTANCE, I THINK A PLUMBER
WOULDN'T NEED A UNION PAYCHECK
IF HE GOT A HEALTHY TIP EVERY
TIME HE SNAKED OUT YOUR TRAP.
NOW, THE BEST PART...
(LAUGHTER).
THE BEST PART IS THE PLUMBER
COMES WITH A READY-MADE TIP JAR.
(LAUGHTER)
AND WISCONSIN'S TEACHERS WOULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN STRIKING IF,
INSTEAD OF A SALARY, THE RICH
KIDS TIPPED THEM.
YOU KNOW, IF THE SERVICE WAS
GOOD.
AND THIS...
(LAUGHTER).
THIS NEW ECONOMIC MODEL WOULD
WORK EVEN BETTER FOR THE MOST
IMPORTANT JOB OF ALL.
VOTING.
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T GET PAID FOR
IT.
BUT I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE
WILLING TO TKPWRA +*ES GREASE YOUR
PALM IF YOU PROVIDE ME WITH SOME
GOOD VOTER SERVICE.
BY, LET'S SAY, VOTING FOR A
CANDIDATE WHO WOULD CUT YOUR
SERVICES AND CUT MY TAXES.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE
ONLY ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE
BY PLEASING ME SO I MIGHT LEAVE
A FEW COINS ON THE COUNTER,
THAT'S SOME CHANGE I CAN BELIEVE
