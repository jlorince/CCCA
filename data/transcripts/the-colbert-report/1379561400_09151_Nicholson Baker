BUT IT'S ALMOST A SCHIZOPHRENICLEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE THINGS
YOU WRITE.
YOU SEE PATTERNS ALL OVER THEPLACE.
SOMETIMES WHERE MAYBE PATTERNSDON'T EXIST.
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF YOURWRITING AS A CRY FOR HELP?

IT EVERYDAY AND KIND OF AD HOCJUST IDEAS ABOUT WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

KILLS?

THINKING ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLYHAPPENS TO HUMAN BEINGS THE WAY
WE -- THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE,WE'RE LUCKY PEOPLE.
BAD THINGS DON'T NORMALLY HAPPENTO US BUT WHAT NOVELISTS OR
SCREEN WRITERS DO IS THEY THINKWE NEED AN EXPLOSION OF SOME
KIND.
AND IT'S STUPID, YOU KNOW?
THAT'S JUST --(LAUGHTER)
BUT WHAT WE ACTUAL CITY WILL DOIS WE READ THE NEWS AND WHEN WE
READ THE NEWS WE HAVE ALL SORTSOF EXPLOSIONS COMING IN ALL THE
TIME.
WE HAVE ALL THESE HORRIBLETHINGS THAT COME IN INDIRECTLY
THROUGH NEWS CHANNELS.

I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE BRINGINGYOU ALL THOSE TERRIBLE STORIES.
>> AND I'M ENORMOUSLY GRATEFUL.
