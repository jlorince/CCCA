VERY TALENTED.
NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF
ANYONE ELSE HAS NOTICED BUT
THINGS ARE PRETTY MESSED UP IN
THE MIDDLE EAST.
WHETHER IT'S SYRIA, IRAN, LIBYA
EGYPT, IRAQ OR SYRIA AGAIN.
APPARENTLY NEW VIOLENCE BROKE
OUT WHILE I WAS LISTING THOSE
OTHER COUNTRIES.
AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
CHOOSE WHICH MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY
I SHOULD COVER SO TONIGHT I TURN
TO A TIME-HONORED EDITORIAL
PROCESS: THE IMPLODING MUSLIM
COUNTRY OF THE WEEK BOOTH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME.
TO THE IMPLODING MUSLIM COUNTRY
OF THE WEEK BOOTH BROUGHT TO YOU
BY SABRA HUMMUS.
SERVE SABRA AT YOUR NEXT PARTY
AND YOUR GUESTS WILL BE CHANTING
"DEATH TO HUNGER."
NOW, I HAVE WRITTEN THE NAME OF
EVERY MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY ON
A DIFFERENT STRIP OF COLORED
PAPER FROM ALLERGY I CAN'T TO
ZEBRA-STAN.
I WILL GET INTO THE BOOTH AND
GRAB ONE AT RANDOM TO REPORT ON.
JIMMY, LET'S SERVE UP SOME BABA
GA-NEWS.
AND THE WINNER IS... THAT TOOK
WAY LONGER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO.
TURKEY!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YES, YES.
TURKEY.
JIM?
>> VIOLENT ANTIGOVERNMENT
PROTESTS HAVE EXPLODED
THROUGHOUT TURKEY.
>> DEMONSTRATORS SAY THE PRIME
MINISTER IS A DICTATOR AND THEY
WANT HIM TO RESIGN.
>> MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN REPORTED HURT OVER THE LAST
WEEK.
>> THE STREETS OF SOME OF
TURKEY'S BIGGEST CITIES HAVE
BECOME BATTLEFIELDS.
POLICE TRIED TO PUSH BACK
PROTESTERS WITH WATER CANNONS.
THE AUTHORITIES FIRED TEAR GAS
INTO A CROWD OF THOUSANDS.
THIS STARTED OUT AS A SMALL
DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE
DESTRUCTION OF AN ISTANBUL PARK
TO MAKE WAY FOR A SHOPPING MALL.
>> Stephen: WOW!
THAT IS THE WORST MALL-RELATED
VIOLENCE SINCE EVERY BLACK
FRIDAY SALE.
NOW IT TURNS OUT THIS WHOLE
BROUHAHA IS OVER MORE THAN JUST
SOME PARK.
IT'S OVER NATIONAL IDENTITY.
YOU SEE, FOR CENTURIES TURKEY
WAS AN OTTOMAN BACKWATER OF
CURVED SWORDS, DECORATIVE
FOOTSTOOL AND POUTERRED
SWEETMEATS.
THEN FIRST TURKISH PRESIDENT AND
KID IN PLAY TRIBUTE HEAD KE MALL
AT A TURK DRAGGED THE COUNTRY
WHIRLING AND DIRVISHING INTO THE
19th CENTURY BY ABOLISHING
THE SULTANATE, THE CALIPHATE AND
THE SHARIA COURTS, SOMETHING
TENNESSEE IS STILL TRYING TO DO.
THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO LIKE IT.
ATTA BOY ATATURK.
BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN 2003
WITH THE ELECTION OF
CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM AND
AUTOCRATIC ANAGRAM RE-JEHP
TA-YEEP AIR-DOE-AHN.
THAT ANAGRAM, BY THE WAY, PRO
GAY CENTIPEDE RAY.
NOW, PRIME MINISTER CENTIPEDE
HERE HAS UPSET SOME ISTANBULEES
BY CALLING FOR WOMEN TO HAVE AT
LEAST THREE CHILDREN, SINGLE SEX
BEACHES AND NEW REGULATIONS ON
THE SALE OF ALCOHOL URGING
CITIZENS TO INSTEAD DRINK AYRAN,
A SALTY MIXTURE OF YOGURT AND
WATER.
BUT PLEASE GO EASY OR YOU WILL
END UP WITH A NASTY CASE OF
YOGURT GOGGLES AND WAKE UP NEXT
