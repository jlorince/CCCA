I AM XAUSZED.
FOLKS, CLEARLY ROMNEY IS SURGING AND HOW'S PRESIDENT OBAMA REACTING?
WELL, CONVENIENTLY FOLKS CLASSIFIED INFO ABOUT HIS ANTI-TERROR OPERATIONS HAPPEN TO
BE LEAKING ALL OVER THE NEWS.
FIRST THERE WERE REPORTS ABOUT A SO-CALLED KILL LIST OF TERRORISTS, THEN U.S.
INVOLVEMENT IN STUX NEST T ATTACKED COMPUTERS IN IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITE.
THEN RUMORS OF A WAR GOING ON IN AFGHANISTAN.
(LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE THAT ONE.
I THINK WE'D HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS.
(LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SEENS YOU TO SEE A PATTERN HERE.
JUST ASK THESE NOT-JEEPS YOUS.
>> ALLEGATIONS ARE WRACKING WASHINGTON TONIGHT, IS THE WHITE HOUSE LEAKING INFORMATION FOR
POLITICAL REASONS TO MAKE PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOK BETTER POLITICALLY?
>> SOMEBODY CONNECTED TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED TO
LEAK THREE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT MAKE THE PRESIDENT LOOK LIKE A STRONG NATIONAL SECURITY LEADER.
>> HE'S TRYING TO BE LIKE GEORGE PATTON AND JOHN WAYNE.
>> Stephen: SO OBVIOUS HE'S TRYING TO BE LIKE GEORGE PATTON
AND JOHN WAYNE OR ERROL FLYNN OF DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS, THAT WILL LOCK UP THE YOUTH VOTE!
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, REVEALING THIS FAVORABLE INFORMATION GIVES AID AND COMFORT TO OUR ENEMIES.
>> THE LEAKS UNDERCUT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TOLL COLLECT INFORMATION.
>> THEY'RE SAYING IT'S NOT DANGEROUS, THAT THIS DOESN'T PUT
ANYBODY IN JEOPARDY BY HAVING THESE LEAKS.
BY THAT NOTION, SHOULDN'T WE JUST START TWEETED OUR TROOP MOVEMENT?
>> THE FACT IS NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.
WE HAVE NEVER CONFIRMED WE EVEN HAVE THE PROGRAM OF DRONE ATTACKS.
>> Stephen: BUT NOW THE CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG!
THE TERRORISTS KNOW WE HAVE DRONE STRIKES.
BEFORE THIS LEAK, AL QAEDA THOUGHT THEIR LEADERS WERE JUST SPONTANEOUSLY EXPLODING FROM
NATURAL CAUSES!
