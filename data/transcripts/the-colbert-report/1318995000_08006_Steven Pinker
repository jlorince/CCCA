(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST HAS A NEW BOOK CALL
"THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR
NATURE: WHY VIOLENCE HAS
DECLINED."
MAN, I'D REALLY LOVE TO SEE TWO
ANGELS FIGHTING.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME STEVEN PINKER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NICE TO HAVE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, WELCOME BACK,
THIS IS YOUR THIRD TRIP TO THE
RODEO.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST BECAUSE I'VE INVITED YOU
BACK TWICE DOESN'T MEAN I'M
IMPRESSED WITH YOUR C.V., OKAY?
YOU'RE A HARVARD ELITE, ARE YOU
NOT?
>> INDEED.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU'VE GOT
A NEW BOOK.
IT IS CALLED "BETTER ANGELS OF
OUR NATURE: WHY VIOLENCE HAS
DECLINED."
WHAT DO YOU MEAN VIOLENCE HAS
DECLINED?
THERE'S VIOLENCE EVERYDAY.
TURN ON "REAL HOUSEWIVES."
(LAUGHTER)
>> YES, BUT THERE USED TO BE
MORE.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, VIOLENCE HAS
BEEN IN DECLINE FOR THOUSANDS OF
YEARS.
WE MAY BE LIVING IN THE MOST
PEACEFUL ERA IN OUR SPECIES'
EXISTENCE.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
WE SHOULD PAINT THAT ON SOME OF
OUR BOMBS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, VIOLENCE HASN'T GONE
DOWN TO ZERO BUT IT HAS
DEFINITELY GONE DOWN.
PREHISTORIC TRIBES KILLED EACH
OTHER AT A RATE OF ABOUT 15%.
DURING THE KINGDOMS IT WENT DOWN
TO 3%.
TODAY IT'S MUCH LESS THAN A
PERCENTAGE POINT.
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE BEING
KILLED BUT AN AWFUL LOT MORE NOT
BEING KILLED.
>> Stephen: IT'S GONE DOWN TO
LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT?
WE KILL LESS THAN A PERCENT OF
EACH OTHER?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
HIT LIKE SEVEN BILLION BY
HALLOWEEN?
SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE ON EARTH BY
HALLOWEEN.
SO HOW MANY OF EACH OTHER WILL
WE KILL ABOUT?
>> EVERY YEAR?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S IT?
THERE ARE 10,000 HANDGUN DEATHS
IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR.
>> OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M TALKING ABOUT IN WARFARE.
MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED
BY... IN HOMICIDES THAN IN
WARFARE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE TAKING
HOMICIDE OUT OF THIS?
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
THEM SEPARATELY.
BUT HOMICIDE HAS DOWN BY A ABOUT
A FACTOR OF 35 SINCE THE MIDDLE
AGES.
SO IN THE MIDDLE AGES HE WAS 35
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE MURDERED
THAN YOU ARE TODAY.
>> Stephen: WELL, THEY DON'T
TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU GO TO
MEDIEVAL TIMES.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, WHEN DO YOU SAY, LIKE,
MODERN NOT KILLING EACH OTHER
STARTED?
LIKE THE GOLDEN AGE OF NOT
KILLING EACH OTHER?
>> IT MIGHT BE NOW.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> IN STATISTICAL TERMS.
>> Stephen: QUOTE YOU USE TO
TITLE YOUR BOOK IS "THE BETTER
ANGELS OF OUR NATURE."
THAT'S LINCOLN FROM THE SECOND
INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
THAT'S RIGHT TOWARD THE END OF
THE BLOODIEST WAR IN U.S.
HIRSTRY AND RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT
SHOT IN THE HEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
ISN'T THAT THE MOST IRONIC
HOPEFUL STATEMENT EVER MADE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, HE DID NOT LIVE TO SEE
MANY OF THE DECLINES OF VIOLENCE
THAT TODAY WE'RE ENJOYING.
I BORROWED THAT PHRASE TO REFER
TO THE PARTS OF HUMAN NATURE
THAT HELPED DRIVE VIOLENCE DOWN.
NOW, WE DO HAVE INNER DEMONS, WE
HAVE A LOT OF MOTIVES THAT CAN
ERUPT ANY TIME.
NEWSPAPER RIGHT.
I'M FIGHTING THE URGE TO PUNCH
YOU RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BUT THE FRONTAL LOBES OF YOUR
BRAIN ARE EXERCISING
SELF-CONTROL WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE
NOT DOING IT.
>> Stephen: I'VE ALSO HAD A LOT
OF TATER TOTS.
I'M FEELING KIND OF LAZY RIGHT
NOW.
LET ME SAY, OKAY, STALIN KILLED
20 MILLION PEOPLE.
MAO KILLED 70 MILLION PEOPLE.
HITLER RACKED UP, YOU KNOW, SIX
MILLION JEWS ALONE AND THEN LIKE
A CLUSTER OF MILLIONS OF
EVERYBODY ELSE HE DIDN'T CARE
FOR.
PLUS ALL THE STUFF ON THE
BATTLEFIELDS.
SO HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT THIS IS
A PEACEFUL STEN WHICH YOU ARELY.
>>
>> TWO THING.
SOMEONE THAT A CENTURY LASTS FOR
A HUNDRED YEARS, NOT JUST 50.
>> Stephen: DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND THE LAST 55 YEARS OF THE
20th CENTURY HAD UNUSUALLY LOW
RATES OF DEATH AND WARFARE.
SO AFTER THAT SPIKE OF WAR
BETWEEN 1914 AND 1918 AND '39 TO
'45, THE RATE OF KILLING AND WAR
WENT DOWN.
IT WAS A PART OF AN ESCALATING
TREND WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE
PREDICTED AT THE TIME.
EVERYONE THOUGHT WELL WORLD WAR
I SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION,
WORLD WAR II MAYBE 15 MILLION ON
THE BATTLEFIELD.
WORLD WAR III IS GOING TO BE
EVEN WORSE BUT IT DIDN'T TURN
OUT THAT WAY.
FIRST THE POWERFUL GREAT POWERS
AND THE DEVELOPED STATES STOP
GOING TO WAR WITH EACH OTHER AND
MORE RECENTLY THAT LED TO THE
REST OF THE WORLD.
IF YOU LOOK AT DEATH AND WARFARE
SINCE WORLD WAR II IT'S A BUMPY
DOWNHILL DECLINE AND IN THE LAST
FEW YEARS AS A PROPORTION OF THE
WORLD'S POPULATION WE'RE AT AN
ALL TIME LOW SINCE THE SECOND
WORLD WAR.
>> Stephen: SO WE MAY BE KILLING
MORE PEOPLE BUT AS A PROPORTION
OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION IT'S
LESS.
>> MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE NOT
BEING KILLED, THEY'RE DIAGNOSE
OF NATURAL CAUSES.
>> SO IF YOU KILL A MILLION
PEOPLE IN A COUNT WRITE TWO
MILLION PEOPLE, THAT'S... THAT'S
PRETTY BAD.
BUT IF YOU KILL A MILLION PEOPLE
BUT THERE ARE 40 MILLION PEOPLE
IN THE COUNTRY, THAT'S PROGRESS.
(LAUGHTER)
STATISTICALLY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE HUMAN LIFE
HAS SUFFERED FROM INFLATION.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
I HOPE NO ONE KILLS YOU
VIOLENTLY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEVEN PINKER THE BETTER ANGELS
OF OUR NATURE.
