(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT".
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE.
YOU'RE TOO KIND.
FOLKS,... (CROWD CHANTING "
STEPHEN")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
YOU KNOW... THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHO AM I TO FIGHT A RISING TIDE
OF LOVE?
NATION, ELIZABETH TAYLOR MAY
HAVE SADLY GONE TO THAT BIG
PERFUME COMMERCIAL IN THE SKY,
BUT WE'VE STILL GOT ANOTHER
FASHIONABLE OLD LADY IN A NEW
NEW AND TURBAN.
MOAMMAR QADDAFI.
(LAUGHTER)
LAST WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA IN
COALITION WITH NATO AND ARAB
PARTNERS LAUNCHED A FULL-SCALE
SOMETHING ON LIBYA.
NO ONE'S SURE WHAT TO CALL IT.
FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A WAR,
THEN A HUMANITARIAN MISSION,
THEN A LIMITED OCCUPATION NOW
THIS.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT HAPPY WITH HIS SET OF
CHOICES.
ONE PERSON TOLD ME IN THE
MEETING HE CALLED THIS MILITARY
ACTION IN LIBYA A TURD SANDWICH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHICH BRINGS US TO
OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF "TURD
SANDWICH IN LIBYA."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I DON'T BLAME THE
PRESIDENT FOR FEELING THAT WAY!
THE SITUATION IN LIBYA IS SO
MUDDLED RIGHT NOW THAT COALITION
FORCES CAN'T EVEN SETTLE ON THE
SPELLING OF THE ENEMY'S NAME.
THE FRENCH SPELL IT LIKE THIS,
THE SPANISH SPELL IT LIKE THIS,
THE BRITS LIKE THIS, THE
ITALIANS LIKE THIS, AND THE
QATARIS LIKE THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WAS MADE UP.
I THINK THEY'RE JUST (BLEEP)ING
WITH US.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IN A DESPERATE, DESPERATE SAD
ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY WHAT HAS BEEN
CALLED OBAMAS VIETNAM BY MANY OF
ME...
(LAUGHTER).
... LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT
ADDRESSED THE ENTIRE NATION AND
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BY IT THAT
I DIDN'T WATCH.
(LAUGHTER)
THERE'S NO NEED TO.
I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES.
>> THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH
TONIGHT HAS MADE THINGS EVEN
MURKIER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE.
>> PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTING
SPEECH BECAUSE IT PROVED THAT
THE OBAMA DOCTRINE IS STILL FULL
OF CHAOS AND QUESTIONS.
>> THE SPEECH WAS A DOG'S
BREAKFAST.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YES, A DOG'S
BREAKFAST.
OBAMA'S SPEECH WAS LIKE BACON,
JALAPENO CORN MUFFINS AND
POP-TARTS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY, MY DOG GIPPER HAS A
SERIOUS CASE OF THE RUNS.
(LAUGHTER)
I HOPE I'M GIVING HIM ENOUGH
JALEPENO CORN MUFFIN.
NOW, SPEAKING OF WITCH, FOLKS,
YOU KNOW WHAT CHAPS MY ASS?
OBAMA'S PLAN INVOLVES
SURRENDERING AMERICA'S
LEADERSHIP OVER TO NATO WHICH IS
LED BY LIEUTENANT GENERAL
CHARLES BOUCHARD OF CANADA!
CANADA!
(LAUGHTER)
CANADA?
(APPLAUSE)
GREAT.
GREAT.
INSTEAD OF A NO-FLY ZONE, WE'RE
GEL A KNOW FLY UNLESS YOU REALLY
WANT TO IN CASE BUT WE PREFER
YOU DIDN'T BUT GO AHEAD ZONE.
SORRY.
AGAIN, I DO NOT HEAR THE
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH BUT IT REALLY
SOUNDED WEAK TO ME.
I WISH HE SHOWED THE KIND OF
CLARITY THAT NEWT GINGRICH
SHOWED ON MARCH 7.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT
LIBYA?
>> EXERCISE A NO-FLY ZONE THIS
EVENING.
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE CONFUSED
ABOUT A MAN WHO ANN HAS BEEN AN
ANTI-AMERICAN DICTATOR SINCE
1969 JUST TELLS YOU HOW INEPT
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS.
THIS IS A MOMENT TO GET RID OF
HIM.
DO IT.
GET IT OVER WITH.
>> Stephen: INCIDENTALLY, "DO
IT, GET IT OVER WITH" IS ALSO
THE E-MAIL NEWT SENDS TO HIS
DIVORCE LAWYER EVERY THREE YEARS
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH IS, OF COURSE, DUE TO HIS
LONG-STANDING OPEN-FLY ZONE.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I
EVEN WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE
KIND OF CLARITY NEWT SHOWED ON
MARCH 23.
>> I WOULD NOT HAVE INTERVENED.
I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF
OTHER WAYS TO AFFECT QADDAFI.
I THINK THERE THERE WERE A LOT OF
ALLIES IN THE REGION WE COULD
HAVE WORKED WITH.
I WOULD NOT HAVE USED AMERICAN
AND EUROPEAN FORCES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE LEADERSHIP
IS NOT ABOUT BOMBING OR NOT
BOMBING.
LEADERSHIP ABOUT BEING
CONSISTENT.
.. I WILL AGAINST WHATEVER OBAMA
DOES.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, THE SPEECH WAS A FAILURE
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ANSWER THE BIG
QUESTIONS, WHAT'S THE EXIT
STRATEGY?
HOWWILL IT COST?
IS THIS IN AMERICA'S VITAL
INTERESTS?
ALL QUESTIONS THAT ARE JUST AS
VALID NOW AS THEY WEREN'T
