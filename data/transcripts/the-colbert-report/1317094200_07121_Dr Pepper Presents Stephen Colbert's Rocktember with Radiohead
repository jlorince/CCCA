[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT," EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
NICELY DONE.
NICELY DONE.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
AND A SPECIAL WELCOME TO THE
FIRST-TIME VIEWERS OF "THE
COLBERT REPORT" WHO ARE WATCHING
ONLY BECAUSE RADIOHEAD IS HERE.
MY NAME IS STEPHEN COLBERT.
THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING A TV.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, IT IS A HUGE NIGHT.
THERE ARE GOING TO BE
PERFORMANCE, INTERVIEWS WITH THE
BAND, AND TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A
REAL CONCERTS, WE'RE GOING TO BE
PUTTING SOME TALL, SWEATY
STRANGERS OUT FRONT TO BLOCK
YOUR VIEW OF THE SHOW.
[LAUGHTER]
NO, NO.
NOT YET.
NOT YET.
THANK YOU.
LATER.
LATER.
AND NATION, NATION, WE ARE DOING
A FULL HOUR.
THAT'S AN ACTION-PACKED 60
MINUTES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO
PADDING.
NO PADDING AT ALL.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT A TOUCH.
OF PADDING.
WHICH, AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY
STATED, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO.
NOW, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE RERUNS
OF TONIGHT'S SHOW WILL ONLY BE A
HALF HOUR, IT'S KIND OF A SHAME
BECAUSE FIRST HALF HOUR IS
GREAT, BUT THE SECOND HALF HOUR
IS INSANE.
SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING THE
HALF-HOUR VERSION AND WANT TO
KNOW WHAT YOU MISSED, JUST
GOOGLE "TOM YORK: LION ATTACK."
GOOD STUFF.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY EXCITING
TONIGHT, FOLKS, BECAUSE
RADIOHEAD IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE
GREATEST MUSICAL ACTS OF THIS OR
ANY GENERATION...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT ALSO, ALSO, THEY ARE THE
ULTIMATE ANTI-CORPORATE BAND.
AS PART OF THEIR WAR AGAINST
SELLING OUT TO BIG BUSINESS, IN
2000 THEY PLAYED A TOUR INSIDE A
CUSTOM TENT SO THEY'D BE FREE OF
CORPORATE LOGOS.
AND IN 1997, THEY TURNED DOWN A
LUCRATIVE DEAL TO CALL OKAY
COMPUTER OKAY TANGERINE
IMMac3G.
SO TONIGHT IN HONOR OF RADIO
HEAD'S ANTI-CORPORATE
COMMITMENT, I AM PROUD TO
ANNOUNCE...
DR. PEPPER PRESENTS STEPHEN
COLBERT'S ROCKTEMBER, WITH
RADIOHEAD, THEY PRESENT
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOBODY'S TOOL.
DR. PEPPER, THE OFFICIAL SOFT
DRINK OF RADIOHEAD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW, IT'S EXCITING.
IT'S EXCITING, BUT LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, I HAVE A RARE
CORRECTION TO MAKE.
DR. PEPPER IS NOT, IN FACT, THE
OFFICIAL SOFT DRINK OF
RADIOHEAD.
THAT IS A SHAMELESS FABRICATION
AND A GROSS BETRAYAL OF
RADIOHEAD'S TRUST, AND I FOR ONE
AM DISGUSTED THAT I THOUGHT I
COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.
JUST TAKE IT.
TAKE IT DOWN, JIMMY.
TAKE IT DOWN NOW, BECAUSE AS FAR
AS I KNOW RADIOHEAD HAS NO
OFFICIAL SOFT DRINK, SO THEY
COULDN'T DO MUCH BETTER THAN
FIRST NAME IN INDY CRED,
DR. PEPPER, CONTAINING THE SAME
PRESERVATIVE THAT KEEPS IGGY POP
ALIVE.
NOW, FOLKS, I UNDERSTAND THAT
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE A
MIND-BLOWING EVENING FOR THE
MUSIC NERDS, WHICH IS WHY IN THE
EVENT ANY RADIOHEAD HEADS
TOTALLY LOSE THEIR [BLEEPED],
I'VE GOT HIPSTER PARAMEDICS
STANDING BY.
HIPSTER PARAMEDICS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HIPSTER PARAMEDICS, THANK YOU
FOR JOINING US.
>> YEAH.
WHAT'S UP?
LAUGHTER LAUGH
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE.
THERE YOU WILL HELP ANYONE WHO
PASSES OUR OR NEEDS ASSISTANCE.
>> YEAH.
BECAUSE I HAVE MEDICAL TRAINING.
LAUGHTER LAUGH
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE MEDICAL
TRAINING.
>> YEAH, I HAVE LIKE A LOT OF
TRAINING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I KIND OF NEED TO
KNOW IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
TRAINING BECAUSE I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR THESE PEOPLE.
>> YEAH, I'M SURE YOU ARE.
>> Stephen: I'M SERIOUS.
DO YOU... BE STRAIGHT WITH ME.
DO YOU EVEN KNOW C.PRIMEP. R.?
>> I DON'T LISTEN TO CLASSIC
ROCK.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU WILL BE
STANDING BY TO OFFER FIRST AID.
>> YEAH, UNTIL RADIOHEAD COMES
ON.
THEN I'M TOTALLY GOING TO LOSE
MY [BLEEPED].
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OKAY.
CLEARLY I'M GOING TO NEED TO...
>> THIS OPENING ACT SUCKS.
BRING ON RADIOHEAD, MAN!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
