BUT GAY MARRIAGE, YEAH, THAT'S
SICK.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, I NEVER JUDGE A MAN
UNTIL I'VE WALKED A MILE IN HIS
UGLY, STUPID SHOES.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I SPEND A LOT OF MY TIME
IN THE MORNING GROOMING.
I TRY TO BE QUIT ABOUT IT, BUT
THE GUY IN THE MIRROR KEEPS
COMING ON TO ME.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
MY HAT TO THE NEW DISPOSABLE
RAISER TO MEN THE SCHICK EXTREME
STYLE REFRESH.
THIS AIN'T YOUR DADDY'S SCHICK
EXTREME THREE-FIFTHS STYLE.
THIS ONE HAS ADDED THE WORD
"REFRESH."
BECAUSE UNLIKE EVERY MEN'S RAY
OR THAT HAS EVER COME BEFORE IT,
THIS ONE HAS A SCENTED HANDLE
THAT BLENDS NOTES OF SPIR MINT,
CITRUS AND ROSEMARY AND EVOKES
HAVING JUST SHOWERED.
FINALLY YOU CAN SMELL SOMETHING
THAT SMELLS LIKE IT JUST
SHOWERED RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE JUST
SHOWERED.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I SAY IT IS ABOUT DAMN TIME!
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY
MORNINGS I STOOD IN MY BATHROOM
SMELLING MY SOAP, A SHAMPOO,
CONDITIONER, BODY WASH, BODY
SPRAY, FACIAL LOTION, SHAVING
CREAM, AFTERSHAVE, AND HAND
LOTION AND SAID "SOMETHING'S
MISSING."
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE PEOPLE OVER AT SCHICK
AGREE WITH ME, TELLING THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" THE RAZOR IS
PROBABLY THE ONLY THING LEFT IN
THE SHOWER THAT'S NOT SCENTED.
BRAVO, GENTLEMEN.
NOW I CAN THROW AWAY MY PREVIOUS
SOLUTION-- SHAVING WITH A BOX
CUTTER DUCT TAPED TO A GLADE
PLUG IN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NEXT UP, FOLKS, I KEEP A CLOSE
EYE ON AMERICANS' REPUBLICAN
GOVERNORS.
THEY'RE LIKE MY CHILDREN, I
VALLS A FAVORITE.
BUT RIGHT NOW MY CURRENT
FAVORITE GOVERNOR IS FLORIDA'S
RICK SCOTT AND, FOLKS, HE IS IN
TROUBLE.
>> FLORIDA'S NEW REPUBLICAN
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT IS TOXIC.
LOOK AT THIS.
HIS APPROVAL RATING IS 29%.
HE JUST GOT INTO OFFICE.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A QUINNIPIAC
POLL.
29% FOR THE NEW GOVERNOR.
>> Stephen: 29% IS LOW.
HE'D PROBABLY BE DOING BETTER IF
HE WASN'T TRYING TO KILL HARRY
POTTER.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, FOLKS, THE CAMPAIGN
PROMISE, WHAT CAN HE DO?
IT WAS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE.
WELL, FOLKS, I AM NOT GIVING UP
ON GOVERNOR SCOTT.
IN FACT, I AM GOING TO BE
SENDING THIS LETTER OF SUPPORT
TO ALL THE MUNICIPALS IN
FLORIDA.
IT READS IN PART "DEAR EDITOR,
WHEN RICK SCOTT RAN FOR GOVERNOR
HE PROMISED TO CREATE JOBS AND
TURN OUR ECONOMY AROUND.
WHILE POLITICIANS USUALLY
DISAPPOINT US AND RARELY KEEP
THEIR PROMISES, RICK IS
REFRESHING BECAUSE HE'S KEEPING
HIS WORD.
RICK SCOTT DESERVES OUR
UNWAIVERING ENTHUSIASTIC
SUPPORT.
HOW CAN WE EXPECT TO ELECT
LEADERS WHO WILL KEEP THEIR WORD
AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR
STATE IF WE DON'T STAND UP FOR
THOSE WITH THE COURAGE TO SET
PRIORITIES, MAKE DIFFICULT
CHOICES, AND ACTUALLY DELIVER ON
THEIR PROMISES MADE?"
I'M SO PROUD OF THIS LETTER.
WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
MY HAT TO GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT
FOR WRITING IT.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SEE, TO BOOST HIS POPULARITY
SCOTT COURAGEOUSLY POSTED THIS
PRE-WRITTEN LETTER OF PRAISE FOR
HIMSELF THAT HIS SUPPORTERS CAN
SIGN AND FORWARD TO FLORIDA
NEWSPAPERS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THOSE ANTI-GOVERNMENT TEA
PARTIERS WHO ELECTED RICK SCOTT
CAN HAVE THE GOVERNMENT WRITE
THEIR LETTERS FOR THEM.
WELL, FOLKS, I WANT TO PRAISE
RICK SCOTT'S PRAISE OF RICK
SCOTT SO I AM POSTING A
PRE-WRITTEN LETTER ON
COLBERTNATION.COM FOR YOU TO
PRINT OUT, SIGN, AND SEND TO
FLORIDA NEWSPAPERS.
DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT PUTTING
WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH.
I HAVE LEFT BLANK SPACES SO YOU
CAN FILL IN YOUR REAL OPINIONS
OF GOVERNOR SCOTT.
IT READS "DEAR EDITOR, IT IS MY
STRONG BELIEF THAT RICK SCOTT IS
A (ADJECTIVE)
GOVERNOR."
(LAUGHTER)
"HIS LETTER PRAISING HIMSELF
MAKES ME WANT TO (VERB)
UP.
I (ADVERB, VERB)
THIS GREAT NATION AND EVERYONE
SHOULD (ACTION VERB)
RICK SCOTT WITH A (NOUN)
FOR AN (INTERJECTION)
FULL BODY SHAVE LIKE A NAKED
HOME RAT.
SINCERELY (NAME, CITY)
" AND I'M SURE THE GOVERNOR WILL
APPRECIATE YOU SENDING THESE
LETTERS AND I'M
