>> IT'S A FAIR FOOD TOMATO FROMFLORIDA.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
A FAIR FOOD TOMATO.
YOU ARE AN ACTIVIST. YOU WERENAMED BY THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER
AS THE PHILANTHROPIST OF THEYEAR.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOUPHILANTHOPING INSTEAD OF SIMPLY
CELEBRITY-ING.
DOESN'T THIS TAKE AWAY FROM YOURRED CARPET TIME?
>> YES, BUT IT'S FOR A GOODCAUSE. THE RELEASE OF
A DOCUMENTARY I JUST MADECALLED "FOOD CHAINS" IS COMING
OUT, AND IT'S ABOUT THEEXPLOITATION OF LABOR IN OUR
FARMS IN AMERICA.
>> Stephen: AND YOU PRODUCEDTHIS?
>> I PRODUCED THE DOCUMENTARY.
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT I PRODUCEDTHE TOMATO.
>> Stephen: NO.
NO, I PRODUCED THEDOCUMENTARY ABOUT FARM WORKERS.
THIS IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUTTOMATOES AND ABOUT FLORIDA.
>> Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW YOUACTUALLY CARE ABOUT FARM
WORKERS?
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ACTRESS AND,NO OFFENSE, ACTORS AND ACTRESSES
GET PAID TO LIE FOR A LIVING.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: TO LOOK LIKE THEYTHEY CARED ABOUT THINGS.
I DON'T THINK YOU CARED ABOUTTHOSE OTHER WOMEN ON WISTERIA
LANE. I REALLY DON'T.
BUT WHEN I WATCHED THE SHOW, IWAS SCARED, CRIED.
YOUR JOYS WERE MY JOYS
YOU KNOW.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: SO WHY DO YOU CAREABOUT THESE WORKERS?
THEY'VE GOT JOBS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVEJOBS.
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF THEPEOPLE WHO PICK OUR TOMATOES
WORK UNDER THAT YOU THINK SHOULDBE CHANGED?
>> I CARE BECAUSE I EAT FOOD,AND YOU EAT FOOD, WE ALL EAT
FOOD AND WE SHOULD REALLY CAREABOUT WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A GREATERINTEREST IN WHAT WE FREE.
WE'RE GLUTEN FREE, SOY FREE,LACTOSE FREE, BUT WE DON'T THINK
ABOUT THE HUMAN COST BEHINDWHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM.
WHAT WE ARE SHOWING IN THEDOCUMENTARY, IT'S AN AMAZING
DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT IS BEINGDONE IN FLORIDA WITH TOMATOES
SPECIFICALLY, AND IT'S CALLEDTHE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM.
THESE WORKERS FORMED THECOALITION OF IMMOKALEE WORKERS
AND CAME UP WITH AN AMAZING
PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY RAISESWAGES BUT STOPS ABUSE IN THE
FIELD, EVERYTHING FROM PHYSICALABUSE, SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND
DOES AN AUDIT OF COMPLIANCE TOMAKE SURE ALL THE FARMERS ARE
APPLYING THIS PARTICULAR FAIRFOOD PROGRAM TO THEIR CROPS AND
THEY'RE DOING IT AMAZINGLY WELL.
>> Stephen: SO THESE WORKERSIN IMMOKALEE, FLORIDA, ARE
GETTING PAID --(APPLAUSE)
I THOUGHT I DID PRONOUNCE THATWELL, IMMOKALEE
THEY'RE GETTING 1 PENNY A POUNDTO PICK TOMATOES RIGHT NOW.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH DO YOUTHINK THEY SHOULD BE PAID PER
POUND?
>> WHAT THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAMDOES IS ASK CONSUMERS AND THE
LARGEST BUYERS OF PRODUCE --SUPERMARKETS AND FAST-FOOD
CHAINS -- TO PAY A PENNY MORE APOUND AND THAT DOUBLES THEIR
WAGES.
>> Stephen: SO 2 PENNIES APOUND.
>> YEAH, TO 2 PENNIES PER POUND.
>> Stephen: YOU REALIZE THAT BYSAYING THAT YOU STILL
KIND OF SOUND LIKE A MONSTER.
ONLY 2 PENNIES A POUND LONGORIA,THEY WOULD CALL YOU.
>> IT WOULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE BY44 CENTS A YEAR AND YOU
LITERALLY DOUBLE THE WAGES OFTHESE FARM WORKERS.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE ACTUALLYGOTTEN SOME PEOPLE INVOLVED
YOU'VE GOTTENMcDONALD'S, BURGER KING,
SUBWAY, CHIPOTLE, ALL THESEFAST-FOOD CHAINS TO GET ON BOARD
WITH THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM(APPLAUSE)
IS THE REAL MESSAGE THAT WESHOULD BUY LESS FRESH FOOD AND
MORE FAST FOOD AS AMERICANS TOHELP THESE PEOPLE?
>> NO, NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO EAT HEALTHY. THAT'SONE OF THE MAIN POINTS
OF THE DOCUMENTARY IS THEC.I.W HAS HAD AMAZING SUCCESS
Stephen: WHAT'S THE C.I.W.? >> COALITION OF IMMOKALEE
WORKERS. IT'S MUCH EASIER,RIGHT? C.I.W.
Stephen: CIUWAH
AND ANYBODY WHO HAS
COME TO THE TABLE HAVE SIGNED ONTO THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM EXCEPT
WENDY'S IN THE FAST FOOD AREA(BOOING)
Stephen: NO WENDY'S?>> YEAH WENDY'S HAS NOT SIGNED
ON TO THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM BUTIN THE SUPERMARKET AREA WHICH IS
A LARGE BUYER OF PRODUCE, WEWANT PEOPLE TO EAT HEALTHY
Stephen: ARE SUPERMARKETS ONBOARD WITH THIS?
SOME, NOT ALL. WE SIGNEDWALMART ON, THEY ARE A
FAIR FOOD PROGRAM BUYER ARE ONBOARD. WHOLE FOODS.
THIS TOMATO IS FROM WHOLE FOODS,SO WE KNOW IT'S A FAIR FOOD
TOMATO.
>> Stephen: MEANING THIS ISLIKE A $40 TOMATO.
>> EXACTLY.
LET ME TELL YOU, SO THE WORKERSMAKE A PENNY PER POUND.
THIS TOMATO IS 2.03.
SO YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE OFTHE PEOPLE DOING THE WORK.
PUBLIX IS THE ONE THAT WILLNOT COME TO THE TABLE, WILL NOT
TALK TO THE C.I.W. ABOUT THEFAIR FOOD PROGRAM.
>> Stephen: WELL, MAYBE IT'SBECAUSE YOU GUYS SCARE PEOPLE
WITH YOUR TACTICS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I'LL SHOW YOU ANEXAMPLE.
JIM, CAN YOU PUT UP THE POSTER?
THAT IS SOCIALIST PROPAGANDA.
THAT MIGHT AS WELL BE MAOPICKING THE TOMATOES UP THERE
THIS DOESN'T SEEM A LITTLEWORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE
TO YOU?>> NO, IT DOESN'T.
>> Stephen: IT DOESN'T?
THIS IS AN INTERESTING PHOTO.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE THEBUCKET.
IT'S OVERFILLED.
THE C.I.W. STOPPED THAT AS WELLBECAUSE THEY'LL MAKE THE WORKERS
SNOW CONE THE BUCKETS, SOTHEY'RE ACTUALLY PICKING ALMOST
A BUCKET AND A THIRD AND NOTGETTING PAID FOR IT.
SO WE'VE STOPPED THAT AS WELLAND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS HOW THEY
CARRY.
THEY CARRY ABOUT 40,000 POUNDS ADAY ON THEIR BACKS, AND THEY'RE
NOT ASKING FOR WORKERS -- FARMWORKERS ARE NOT ASKING FOR A
CRAZY AMOUNT OF PAY, THEY'REASKING TO BE PAID FOR THE WORK
THEY'RE DOING. FAIR PAY
>> Stephen: MY OTHER ISSUE ISYOU'RE ASKING ME TO THINK ABOUT
WHERE MY FOOD COMES FROM.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: AND I DON'T WANTTO THINK ABOUT THAT.
A LOT OF IT COMES FROM DIRT,OKAY?
AND IT'S THERE A LOT LONGER THANTHE 5-SECOND RULE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHY MUST I THINKABOUT WHERE MY FOOD COMES FROM?
IT COMES FROM THE KITCHEN.
>> IT DOES NOT.
>> Stephen: IT DOES NOT?
IT DOES NOT COME FROM THEKITCHEN.
AMERICA HAS A HISTORY OFEXPLOITING LABOR.
WHEN WE CREATED THE FAIR LABORSTANDARDS ACT WHICH PROTECTS
WORKERS, IT EXCLUDEDAGRICULTURE.
THE 40-HOUR WORK WEEK, VACATION,MINIMUM-WAGE, EXCLUDES
AGRICULTURE.
>> Stephen: CHILD LABOR.
YOU WERE IN THE FIELD, YOUKNOW HOW HARD IT WAS.
>> Stephen: I WORKED AN ENTIREDAY.
>> NO, NO.
I THINK YOU WORKED THREE HOURS.
>> Stephen: WELL, LISTEN, THATIS A WORKDAY FOR ME.
(LAUGHTER)EVA LONGORIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
