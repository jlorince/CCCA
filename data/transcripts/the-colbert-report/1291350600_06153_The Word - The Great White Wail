THIS GUY.
FOLKS, SEEMS LIKE TODAY EVERYONE
GETS TO CLAIM THEY'RE A VICTIM,
EXCEPT THE MOST PERSECUTED
MINORITY, THE MAJORITY.
WHITE PEOPLE.
NOW AS A EUROPEAN MALE, I WANT
TO GRIPE ABOUT ALL THE
INJUSTICES DONE TO ME, BUT WHEN
I GET TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE
VICTIM CLUB, THERE'S A SIGN THAT
SAYS NO WHITES ALLOWED.
WELL, THANKFULLY THERE'S A WAY
WE CAN FINALLY GET WHAT WE
DESERVE, AND IT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE GREAT WHITE WHALE.
FOLKS, THIS WEEK CONGRESS
SETTLED SOMETHING CALLED THE
PIGFORD CLAIM.
IT AUTHORIZES 4.6 BILLION
DOLLARS TO SETTLE DISCRIMINATION
CLAIMS BY BLACK FARMERS WHO WERE
DENIED LOANS AND AMERICAN
INDIANS WHO WERE CHEATED OUT OF
LAND ROYALTIES.
BIG DEAL.
IF INDIANS BELIEVED IN LAND
OWNERSHIP, WHY WAS IT SO EASY TO
TAKE IT FROM THEM?
NOW, I'M NOT... I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO IS UPSET, SO IS IOWA
REPRESENTATIVE AND VACANT STARE
RECORD HOLDER STEVE KING.
JIM.
>> FIGURE THIS OUT, MADAM
SPEAKER.
WE HAVE A VERY, VERY URBAN
SENATOR, BARACK OBAMA, WHO HAS
DECIDED HE'S GOING TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT.
WHAT DOES HE DO IN HE INTRODUCES
LEGISLATION TO CREATE A WHOLE
NEW PIGFORD CLAIM.
>> YES, THIS WAS ALL A PLOY BY
OBAMA TO GET VOTES.
NOW, SOME FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT
KING CALLED HIM VERY, VERY
URBAN.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE
MOST OF KENYA IS ACTUALLY QUITE
RURAL.
BUT STEVE KING SEES WHAT THESE
PAYMENTS TO BLACK FARMERS REALLY
ARE.
>> WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP AT SOME
POINT AND SAY, WE'RE NOT GOING
THE PAY SLAVERY REPARATIONS IN
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.
>> DAMN STRAIGHT.
NOW HE'S NOT SAYING THIS RECENT
DISCRIMINATION NEVER HAPPENED.
HE'S JUST POINTING OUT THAT ANY
MONEY WE GIVE TO BLACK PEOPLE IS
ALWAYS REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY.
AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO
DESERVE THOSE REPARATIONS.
>> THAT DEBT WAS PAID FOR IN
BLOOD, AND IT WAS PAID FOR IN
THE BLOOD OF A LOT OF YANKEES
ESPECIALLY.
AND THERE'S NO REPARATIONS FOR
THE BLOOD THAT PAID FOR THE SIN
OF SLAVERY.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
NO ONE IS STANDING UP FOR THE
REAL VICTIMS OF SLAVERY, WHITE
MEN.
IN THE NORTH THEY GAVE THEIR
LIVES.
YOU'RE WELCOME, BLACK PEOPLE.
THEY DIDN'T GET REPARATIONS.
AND IN THE SOUTH, WHITE MEN ARE
EVEN BIGGER VICTIMS.
IN THE SOUTH, IN THE SOUTH, THEY
LOST THEIR SLAVES.
AND THOSE THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE.
AND I AM NOT SAYING...
( LAUGHTER )
AND I AM NOT SAYING, FOLKS, THAT
BLACK PEOPLE ARE THINGS.
I'M SAYING THEY WERE THINGS.
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET A RECEIPT.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST BLACK SLAVES
OPPRESSING WHITE MEN.
IT'S ALSO DEAD INDIANS.
RIGHT, CHIEF SWEATS LIKE A HOG?
>> HOW MANY NATIVE AMERICAN, HOW
MANY INDIANS WERE KILLED BY THE
ARRIVAL OF THE WHITE MAN THROUGH
DISEASE AND WAR, AND HOW MANY
PEOPLE HAVE DIED SINCE THE WHITE
MAN ARRIVED HERE DUE TO LUNG
CANCER THANKS TO THE
INDIAN-INVENTED CUSTOM OF
SMOKING TOBACCO?
WHO ARE THE REAL KILLERS HERE?
WHERE ARE OUR REPARATIONS?
>> Stephen: YOU TELL 'EM,
RUSH.
AND AFTER THE INDIANS TOOKED US
ON TOBACCO?
WHO PICKED IT, THE SLAVES.
THEY'RE IN CAHOOTS.
MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE, FOLKS,
WHERE'S OUR THANKS FOR
INTRODUCING INDIANS TO WHISKY?
NOW HOW ABOUT SOME CASH FOR MY
ANCESTORS' TENNIS ELBOW, OR AS
IT WAS KNOWN IN SLAVE TIME,
"WHIPPING WRIST."
AND THEN, FOLKS, DON'T FORGET
THE CHINESE.
DON'T FORGET THE CHINESE, FOLKS.
SURE WE EXPLOITED THEM TO BUILD
THE RAILROADS, BUT WHAT ABOUT
OUR TRAPPED FINGERS?
LOOK AT THIS.
DAMN YOU.
( APPLAUSE )
DAMN YOU, YOU BUDDHIST BASTARD.
I SAY, I SAY, I SAY IT'S TIME
WHITE MEN GOT REPARATIONS FOR
ALL THE PAIN AND SUFFERING WE'VE
SUFFERED CAUSING PAIN AND
SUFFERING TO OTHERS.
BECAUSE THIS BIGFORD CLAIM MOVES
THERE'S CLEARLY MONEY IN BEING A
VICTIM.
AND IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE,
WHEN SOMETHING IS VALUABLE,
WHITE MEN GET TO TAKE IT.
