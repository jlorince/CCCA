[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME!
BOOM!
BOOM!
WOO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
>> Stephen: YES!
YES!
YES!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ABSOLUTELY.
WELCOME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES, PLEASE.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK.
PLEASE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THOSE BASTARDS HAVE HAD A FREE RIDE LONG ENOUGH.
IT ENDS TONIGHT.
NATION, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECOND TERM IS ONLY A WEEK OLD, AND ALREADY WE ARE ONE WEEK CLOSER
TO DYING.
WELCOME TO OBAMACARE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THE PRESIDENT IS DROPPING THE BALL ON HOMELAND SECURITY.
>> THE TSA IS REMOVING THE BODY SCANNERS THAT PRODUCE A NAKED IMAGE OF THE PASSENGERS BODIES.
YOU REMEMBER THOSE?
THEY'RE BEING REMOVED BC THE COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES THEM COULDN'T MEET A DEADLINE TO
INSTALL THE PRIVACY SOFTWARE.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE REPLACED WITH OTHER SCANNERS THAT PRODUCE A GENERIC OUTLINE OF THE
PASSENGER'S BODY.
>> Stephen: A GENERIC OUTLINE OF THE BODY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW CAN I LEGALLY SHOW THE TSA MY PENIS NOW?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I USED TO WRITE THEM LITTLE MESSAGES IN LEAD-BASED PAINT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LIKE "GOOD MORNING" OR "ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, I DO "NOT" WISH TO HAVE A KOSHER
MEAL."
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR ON A PARTICULAR CHILLY DAY, "HI."
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE TSA'S JUST CAVING TO PRESSURE BECAUSE THE SCANNERS WERE CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO INVASIVE.
OH, PLEASE!
WHAT IS INVASIVE ABOUT A TECHNOLOGY CALLED, AND I THINK I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY RAPE-I-SCAN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS A MISTAKE, NATION.
NOW, WE'LL NEVER COMPLETE OUR NATIONAL DATABASE OF RADICAL ISLAMIC NAUGHTY PARTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'D ALREADY ESTABLISHED A PROFILE, YOUNG AND LEANING TO THE RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLUS, IT WAS A DETERRENT.
TERRORISTS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR MODESTY.
THAT'S WHY KHALID SHEIKH MUHAMMAD WAS WEARING A T-SHIRT OVER THAT SWEATER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FASHION FANS HERE.
LAUGH THE WORST PART IS, WITHOUT THESE SCANNERS, I HAVE NO REASON TO LAUGH STAY IN SHAPE ANY MORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SURE, EXERCISE WILL MAKE ME LOOK BETTER, FEEL BETTER, BE MORE ATTRACTIVE, BUT IF A GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEE GETTING PAID TEN BUCKS AN HOUR DOESN'T SEE HOW I'VE SHAVED INCHES OFF MY MUFFIN TOP,
WHY EVEN FLY ANYMORE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE BUS,
