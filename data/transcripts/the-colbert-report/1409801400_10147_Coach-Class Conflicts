>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
NATION, THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I DON'T HAVE TO TELLYOU IT'S NO SURPRISE WE ALL
KNOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT AIRTRAVEL IS TERRIBLE.
FLIGHTS ARE ALWAYS LATE,THEY CUT THE SEX SCENES FROM
THE MOVIES.
AND THE SEAT BELTS ARENOWHERE NEAR LONG ENOUGH TO
HANG YOURSELF.
(LAUGHTER)AND THINGS ARE ONLY GETTING
WORSE.
>> AS PLANES HAVE BECOMEMORE PACKED, FLIGHT
ATTENDANTS SAY THEY HAVENOTICED AN INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF INCIDENTSINVOLVING UNRULY
PASSENGERS.
A WOMAN KNITTING DECIDED TORECLINE HER SEAT.
A WOMAN BEHIND HER WAS TRYINGTO SLEEP AND SHE HAD HER
HEAD ON A TRAY TABLE.
ACCORDING TO PASSENGERS SHESTARTED SCREAMING AND
SWEARING.
>> LAST NIGHT ON THEAMERICAN AIRLINES JET FROM
MIAMI TO PARIS, A MAN FOUGHTWITH A PASSENGER SEATED IN
FRONT OF HIM, HE SAYSBECAUSE HIS LEGS HURT FROM
DIABETES.
A FLIGHT ATTENDANT TRIED TOCALM THE MAN WHO REPORTEDLY
BECAME MORE IRATE ANDGRABBED ATTENDANT BY THE
ARM THAT IS WHEN AIRMARSHALS BROKE THEIR COVER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,ARMED MARSHALS ARE NOW
POISED TO SUBDUE THEDISGRUNTLED.
MAKING THE FOUR SEATINGCLASSES NOW FIRST, BUSINESS,
ECONOMY AND THE HUNGERGAMES.
(LAUGHTER)AND IN THE BATTLE FOR LEG
ROOM, THE WEAPONS AREGETTING MORE AND MORE
SOPHISTICATED.
>> THE TWO PASSENGERS INMIDDLE SEATS IN ECONOMY PLUS,
THOSE ARE THE SEATS YOU PAYEXTRA FOR A BIT MORE LEG
ROOM.
THE MAN IN 12 B USING WHATIS CALLED A KNEE DEFENDER ON
THE SEAT BACK IN FRONT OFHIM.
THOSE BRACKETS PLACED ON THETRAY TABLE KEEP THE SEAT IN
FRONT FROM RECLINING.
THAT MEANT THE WOMAN IN 11 BCOULD NOT LEAN BACK AND SHE
WAS NOT HAPPY.
AN ARGUMENT OVER PERSONALSPACE UNTIL SHE REPORTEDLY
TOOK A CUP OF WATER,THROWING IT INTO THE FACE OF
THE MAN BEHIND HER.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHYSHE DIDN'T JUST CHANGE
SEATS.
THEY WERE THE ONLY TWOPEOPLE ON THE PLANE.
(LAUGHTER)NATION, THIS IS A TREND.
THIS IS A TREND ACROSS ALLMAJOR AIRLINES.
AS AIRLINE WEEKLY PUT IT,QUOTE, DENSIFICATION IS A
MAJOR TREND IN THE INDUSTRYNOW.
AND WHEN THERE'S MAJORDENSIFICATION YOU CAN EXPECT
A LITTLE PUNCHIFICATION.
SOME SHOUTENING ANDEVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING
TO GET STABULATED.
BUT LET ME ASSURE NEW ISHAPPENING FOR THE BEST
POSSIBLE REASONS, FLYERS INTHE BACK OF THE PLANE ARE
GETTING SQUEEZED TO GIVEPASSENGERS IN FIRST AND
BUSINESS CLASS MORE ROOM.
NOW IT MIGHT SEEM UNFAIR,BUT THIS IS THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS AS EXPLAINEDBY THIS REPRESENTATIVE FROM
UNITED AIRLINES.
>> I BELONG TO THE FRONT.
YOU BELONG TO THE TAIL.
KEEP YOUR PLACE.
>> Stephen: AND NO, YOU MAYNOT HAVE A WHOLE CAN OF
APPLE JUICE.
I SAY THAT AIRLINES HAVE TODO MORE TO TURN COACH
CONFLICTS INTO ENTERTAINMENTFOR US WEALTHY FLYERS.
WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING ALIVE FEED OF THESE AISLE
FIGHTS FOR OUR PERSONALPLASMA SCREENS?
FORGET THAT DINKY KNEEDEFENDER, LET'S STRAP SOME
RAZORS ON THOSE ELBOWS ANDWAGER ON THESE PEOPLE LIKE
THEY FROM GAME-COCKS, MYMONEY IS ON THE GUY IN 16 A.
SOMEBODY PUT THEIR BAG IN HISOVERHEAD BIN, HE HAS
THE LOOK OF A KILLER.
THEY CAN PACK MORE PEOPLEBACK THERE.
A SAW A REVOLUTIONARY NEWSEATING DESIGN.
NOT ONLY YOU CAN PACK TWICEAS MANY PEOPLE INTO COACH,
YOU CAN FILL THE CARGO HOLDWITH SPICES AND MOLASSES TO
BRING BACK FROM THE COLONIS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
