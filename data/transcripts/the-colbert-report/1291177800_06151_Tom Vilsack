EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE U.S.
SECRETARY OFFING A SELL CHUR.
GET READY FOR THE VILSACK
ATTACK.
PLEASE WELCOME AGRICULTURE
SECRETARY TOM VILSACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SECRETARY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> YOU BET.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
>> IT'S NICE TO BE BACK.
>> Stephen: LAST TIME I SPOKE
TO YOU, YOU WERE RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
>> I WAS ACTUALLY LEAVING THE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
>> Stephen: HOW DID THAT WORK
OUT?
>> NOT VERY WELL.
>> Stephen: PRETTY GOOD FOR
YOU.
YOU LEFT THE RACE AND YOU GOT
THIS GREAT SWEET JOB IN THE
CABINET.
YOU USED TO RUN AGAINST BARACK
OBAMA.
NOW YOU'RE IN HIS CABINET.
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING SECRETARY
OF AGRICULTURE?
HOW ARE THE CROPS COMING IN THIS
YEAR?
HOW'S THE CORN?
>> WE'RE DOING PRETTY WELL THIS
YEAR.
31% INCREASE IN FARMER INCOME.
WE'RE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE BEST
YEAR OF FARM EXPORTS.
SO IT'S BEEN A GOOD YEAR.
>> NOW I'M A HUGE FAN.
THEY ARE, TOO.
THEY ARE, TOO.
I LOVE THE SECRETARY OF
AGRICULTURE, AND I LOVE WHOEVER
IT IS YOU... I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
YOU'RE THE FOOD GUY, RIGHT?
AMERICANS LOVE FOOD.
I LOVE FOOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GET FOOD
TO OUR MOUTH FASTER?
BECAUSE AMERICANS WILL CONSUME
FOOD AS FAST AS WE GET IT, AND
WE DON'TER -- EVER SEEM TO GET
FULL.
>> WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON IS
TRYING TO MAKE SURE FOLKS
CONTINUE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE FOOD
IN THIS COUNTRY.
DURING A TOUGH RECESSION, WE'VE
INCREASED BENEFITS FOR THOSE
STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS
RECESSION, SNAP PROGRAM.
>> Stephen: I WATCH THE GLENN
BECK PROGRAM.
HE SAYS IT'S LIKE $11 FOR AN EAR
OF CORN NOW.
>> IT'S NOT QUITE THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
>> WELL, PRICES ARE GOOD.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT,
BUT PRICES ARE ALSO GOOD AT THE
GROCERY STORES.
AMERICANS SPEND LESS OF THEIR
DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR GROCERIES
THAN JUST ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE ON
THE FACE OF THE EARTH WHICH
MEANS WE HAVE MORE DISCRETIONARY
INCOME TO SPEND ON OTHER THINGS
LIKE CARS AND NICER HOMES AND
VACATIONS.
>> YOU HAVE THIS THING COMING UP
IN CONGRESS TOMORROW CALLED THE
CHILD NUTRITION BILL.
>> VERY IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT?
>> 32 MILLION YOUNGSTERS GO TO
SCHOOL TOMORROW.
THEY'LL HAVE SCHOOL LUNCH.
12 MILLION WILL HAVE BREAKFAST.
IT'S A PROGRAM THAT WILL
HOPEFULLY PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO
THE PROGRAM AND HIGHER-QUALITY
FOOD FOR OUR YOUNGSTERS IN
SCHOOL.
>> I SEE THE WORD "NUTRITION" A
LOT.
WHAT IS THERE BETWEEN NUTRITION
AND FOOD?
MOSTLY I HEAR ABOUT KNEW
TRIGHTS, LIKE WE WANT TO GIVE
OUR KID NUTRITION.
SHOULDN'T WE JUST GIVE THEM
FOOD.
>> HERE'S THE SAD REALITY ABOUT
OUR SCHOOL LUNCHES.
WE'VE HAD TOO MUCH FAT AND TOO
MUCH SUGAR, TOO MUCH SODIUM, NOT
ENOUGH FRUITS AND INDIVIDUAL
TACKLES AND LOW FAT DAIRY AND
WHOLE GRAINS.
WE'LL TRY CHANGE THAT.
>> HERE'S A LITTLE QUANDARY
YOU'RE IN.
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE AND THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT, WE SUBSIDIZE
SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT ALSO
PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE
DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO EAT.
YOU KNOW, LIKE FATS IN MEAT,
SUGARS, EXTRACTED FROM CORN,
WHICH IS SUPER, SUPER CHEAP.
WHY DO WE SUBSIDIZE THOSE AND
THEN SAY TO THE KIDS, DON'T EAT
IT?
WHY DON'T WE JUST NOT SUBSIDIZE
IT ANYMORE.
THEY WON'T MAKE AS MUCH AND IT
WILL BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR KIDS
TO GET?
>> WELL, THE REALITY IS WE DO
HAVE TO HAVE A SAFETY NET FOR
OUR FARMERS BECAUSE IT'S A TOUGH
BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER
WEATHER, YOU HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER MARKETS.
YOU NEED TO KNOW PROBABLY 90% OF
AMERICA'S FARMERS ARE JUST
BARELY MAKING IT.
10% ARE DOING PRETTY WELL.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FARMERS
OUT THERE WHO STRUGGLE, SO IT IS
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STRONG
SAFETY NET.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE AGAIN WANT
TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AFFORDABLE
FOOD FOR FOLKS IN THIS COUNTRY
AND THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE AT
U.S.D.A. ARE DESIGNED TO HELP
THAT.
>> WHAT'S THE FOOD PYRAMID
ABOUT?
CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THAT?
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
THAT SEEMS NANNY STATE?
>> IT'S A DIETARY GUIDELINE.
IT'S JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EDGE
CAIGHTS.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW ELSE WHO
BUILT PYRAMIDS, PHARAOHS, WHEN
THEY ENSLAVED THE ANCIENT
ISRAELITES.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE FOOD PYRAMID
ENSLAVES AMERICAN, EAT THIS,
DON'T EAT THAT, A NANNY STATE.
>> ONE-THIRD OF OUR YOUNGSTERS
ARE OBESE OR AT RISK OF BEING
OBESE.
IT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY
PROBLEM.
GENERALS AND ADMIRALS ARE
CONCERNED WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE VOLUNTEER
ARMY.
>> Stephen: THE ANY TIMED --
"NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED THAT
WHILE MRS. OBAMA AND THE
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ARE
TELLING KIDS NOT TO BE OBESE,
THEY'RE ALSO ENCOURAGING THE
INCREASE OF THE CONSUMPTION OF
CHEESE.
I DON'T SEE A CONFLICT THERE
BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU COULD
PUT MELTED CHEESE ON ANY FOOD
AND GET ME TO EAT IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, THERE'S MODERATION IN
ALL THINGS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERDO A GOOD
THING.
>> Stephen: YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO EAT MORE CHEESE THAN SAY
LARGER THAN YOUR HEAD?
>> NOPE.
AS A RESULT OF, THAT WE BROUGHT
SOMETHING FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
A BIG FAN OF CHEESE.
MAYBE I CAN PRESENT IT NOW.
IT'S A LITTLE HEAVY.
STEEP STEP THAT IS OKAY.
>> AND IT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE.
>> Stephen: IT'S SOLID.
>> IT IS A STEPHEN COLBERT FACE
IN CHEDDAR CHEESE.
FROM WISCONSIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: MY PROFILE.
WOW, THAT IS... I WOULD NOT SAY
THAT IS SLENDERIZING.
( LAUGHTER )
>> 25 POUNDS ORGANIC CHEESE
PRODUCED BY ORGANIC VALLEY
CO-OP.
>> Stephen: WHAT KIND OF
CHEESE IS THIS?
>> CHETER.
>> Stephen: CHEDDAR.
WELL, IT MAY BE CHEDDAR, BUT I
HAVE TO SAY, I LOOK GOUDA.
