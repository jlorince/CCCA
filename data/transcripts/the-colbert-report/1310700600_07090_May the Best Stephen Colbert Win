PRAY FOR THEM.
I CERTAINLY HOPE LOS ANGELES
SURVIVES BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO BE
OUT IN L.A. OR THE BIG ANGEL, AS
THEY SAY, IN JUST A COUPLE
MONTHS.
I DON'T WANT TO BUT IT'S
BUSINESS BECAUSE THIS MORNING I
GOT NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YEP.
YES.
THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN
PERSON.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
YES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I SEE THESE PEOPLE ON THE RED
CARPET.
NOW I'VE ALREADY GOT TWO FOR THE
SHOW, SO THIS COULD POSSIBLY
LEAD TO AN EMMY THREE-WAY.
SEE.
THEY'RE ALL GIRLS.
I CHECKED.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, "THE REPORT" IS NOMINATED
FOR BEST DIRECTING, BEST WRITING
AND BEST LATE NIGHT SHOW.
UNBELIEVABLY WE WERE ONCE AGAIN
SNUBBED FOR OUTSTANDING
ACHIEVEMENT IN PROSTHETIC
MAKE-UP.
PEOPLE JUST DON'T REALIZE THAT
UNDER THIS I'M LIKE ADMIRAL
ACKBAR.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WAS
NOMINATED TWICE IN THE SAME
CATEGORY, FIRST FOR "THE
REPORT," AND THEN AGAIN FOR LATE
NIGHT WITH JIMMY FALLON, SINCE
AS YOU'LL RECALL HE USED MY
TRADEMARK IMAGE ON HIS EMMY
SCREENER SENT OUT TO THE VOTERS.
NOW HE IS MY BEST FRIEND FOR SIX
MONTHS, SO, JIMMY, GOOD LUCK TO
YOU, BY WHICH I MEAN GOOD LUCK
