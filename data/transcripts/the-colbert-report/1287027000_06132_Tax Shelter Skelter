EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, AS AMERICANS, IT IS OUR
DUTY TO KEEP THE LEGACIES OF OUR
FORMER PRESIDENTS ALIVE.
FROM LINCOLN FREEING THE SLAVES
TO BONDAGE TO RONALD REAGAN'S
FREEING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
OF THEIR JOBS, I SAY LET THE
FREE MARKET DECIDE WHICH JET HAS
THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.
AND THE LEGACY OF OUR GREAT OR
GREATEST PRESIDENT IS UNDER TAKE
BECAUSE THE BUSH TAX CUTS ARE
ABOUT TO EXPIRE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING THE
RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING
OVER $250,000 A YEAR.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
>> WHAT IS HURTING OUR COUNTRY
THE MOST RIGHT NOW, HURTING OUR
ECONOMY THE MOST IS CLASS
WARFARE.
>> CLASS WARFARE.
>> CLASS WARFARE.
>> THIS IS CLASS WARFARE.
>>
>> Stephen:, YES, IT IS CLASS
WARFARE, AND IT'S NOT A FAIR
FIGHT BECAUSE WE GIVE THE
WORKING CLASS ALL THE GOOD
COMBAT EXPERIENCE.
RICH PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
SUFFERING.
AS FINANCIAL ADVISER KEITH
WHITAKER TOLD "NEWSWEEK," "TO BE
RICH NOW MEANS TO LIVE IN
ANXIETY.
WILL YOU REMAIN THE WEALTHY?
WILL THE MARKET OR THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT STRIPO OF YOUR
ASSETS, AND WILL I LOSE MY
SUMMER HOME?
AND WHAT ABOUT MY WINTER, SPRING
AND FALL HOME?"
IN FACT, THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMY
HAS MADE THE RICH SO ANXIOUS
THAT HEIRS AND HEIRESSES ARE
GOING TO FINANCIAL BOOT CAMP.
JUST LIKE MILITARY BOOT CAMP,
EXCEPT THE BOOTS ARE MANOLOS.
AND LIKE MOST CAMPERS, THE SUPER
RICH JUST WANT THE BOND WITH
LIKE-MINDED FRIENDS.
ACCORDING TO INVESTMENT ADVISER
CHARLOTTE BEIER, WHAT THE RICH
WANT IS A CHANCE TO DISCUSS
THEIR FINANCIAL WORRIES WITHOUT
FEELING RIDICULED.
NOTHING IS MORE AWKWARD THAN
COMPLAINING ABOUT SKIING AT
TAHOE TO SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN A
CHEVY TAHOE.
THE WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS THIS TAX
INCREASE BY SAYING IT'S
NECESSARY, AS EXPLAINED BY CHIEF
ECONOMIC ADVISER AND SPOOKIEST
CABINET MEMBER AUSTAN GOOLSBEE.
JIM.
>> WE'VE GOT A BIG BACK AND
FORTH GOING ABOUT THE TAX CUT.
UNDER THE REPUBLICAN PLAN,
HOWEVER, PEOPLE MAKING MORE THAN
$1 MILLION A YEAR ARE GOING TO
BE GET A TAX CUT OF MORE THAN
$100,000.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
GIVEN THESE BIG RED EGGS TO THE
VERY HIGH-INCOME PEOPLE WOULD BE
$700 BILLION WE WOULD HAVE TO
BORROW.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT?
WE'LL JUST BORROW IT FROM
SOMETHING ELSE BIG AND RED.
( LAUGHTER )
AND MAKING OVER $250,000 A YEAR
DOES NOT MAKE YOU RICH.
LOOK AT ME.
I MAKE SERIOUS COIN.
BUT I'M MIDDLE CLASS.
I JUST HAPPEN TO BE UPPER ELITE
PLATINUM PLUS MIDDLE CLASS.
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE MIDDLE
CLASS, I KNOW THAT ANY TAX
INCREASE ON THE WEALTHY WILL
HURT ALL OF US.
I MEAN NEW YORK SATURDAY'S "THE
NEW YORK TIMES," HARVARD
ECONOMIST M. GREGORY MANCU
EXPLAINS THAT RAISING RATES ON
THE WEALTHY KILLS INCENTIVES,
WRITING, I CAN AFFORD HIGHER
TAXES BUT THEY'LL MAKE ME WORK
LESS."
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
NATION, FEWER M. GREGORY MANCU
OP ENDS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL ASK
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE TO EXPLAIN WHY
HE AND THE PRESIDENT WANT TO
DEPLETE OUR PRECIOUS
