YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK I'M GOING TO READ THEREST OF THAT LATER.
(LAUGHTER)NATION, A WISE MAN ONCE SAID...
(LAUGHTER)(BLEEP) KEEP GOING!
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER.
FIRST UP, YESTERDAY THEENVIRO-MENTAL PATIENTS CAME OUT
OF THEIR YURTS TO PROTEST GLOBALWARMING IN A PLACE SYNONYMOUS
WITH NATURE -- MIDTOWNMANHATTAN.
>> AN ESTIMATED 300,000 PEOPLEMARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS OF
MANHATTAN FOR HOURS TODAY FORACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> THIS WAS THE LARGEST CLIMATEPROTEST IN HISTORY.
>> STEPHEN: YES, HUNDREDS OFTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED THE
STREETS OF NEW YORK FOR CLIMATECHANGE.
OR WERE IN LINE FOR THE NEWiPHONE.
(LAUGHTER)THE EVENT WAS PACKED WITH LEFTY
CELEBRITIES LIKE STING, MARKRUFFALO, AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO.
YOU'D THINK HE'D BE "FOR"ICEBERGS MELTING.
(LAUGHTER)I GUESS HE DIDN'T LOVE ROSE THAT
MUCH AFTER ALL.
ALSO IN ATTENDANCE, THOUSANDS OFANGRY COMMUTERS.
>> THE MARCH SHUT DOWN MAJORCITY ARTERIES FOR MOST OF THE
DAY, SNARLING TRAFFIC INTO THEEVENING.
>> MOTORISTS TRYING TO MAKE ITDOWN THE WEST SIDE WERE STRANDED
FOR HOURS.
>> I SAT IN TRAFFIC FOR TWOHOURS.
>> I GOT SO ANGRY AND ENRAGED.
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET CRAZY?
>> STEPHEN: YOU HEAR THAT,GREENIES?
YOU LOST HODA KOTB!
AND AS GOES HODA, SO GOES THENATION.
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT SURE WHICH NATION.
I'M GONNA SAY THE ONE THATPRODUCES THE MOST MERLOT.
(LAUGHTER)SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT
-- WHY DON'T I DRINK WINE DURINGMY SHOW?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT
TO CLIMATE CHANGE MARCHERS FORMAKING THOUSANDS OF CARS BURN
TWO EXTRA HOURS OF GASOLINE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW, I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE THERE
THIS WEEKEND.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN, BUT IDIDN'T WANT TO.
(LAUGHTER)I STILL SHOWED SOLIDARITY WITH
THE TRAPPED MOTORISTS BY KEEPINGMY CAR RUNNING ALL WEEKEND.
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T WANT TOANGER MY LIBERAL NEIGHBORS, SO I
KEPT THE GARAGE DOOR CLOSED.
I GOTTA SAY, THE WEEKEND JUSTFLEW BY!
AND I MET THE NICEST EMT CREW.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, IT'S HARD TOREMEMBER A TIME WHEN THE NATION
WAS MORE DIVIDED.
EVEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR, ATLEAST BOTH SIDES AGREED ON
IRONIC FACIAL HAIR.
THESE DAYS, THINGS IN WASHINGTONARE SO HOSTILE THAT, ACCORDING
TO THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE,"FULLY 75% OF SALIENT NATIONAL
ISSUES ARE GRIDLOCKED INCONGRESS ."
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE ONLYBIPARTISAN BILL TO PASS THIS
YEAR WAS "H.R. 594 EAT A BAG OFDICKS."
(LAUGHTER)SAILED THROUGH. UNANIMOUS.
BUT TWO SENATORS HAVE TAKEN ABOLD STEP TO END THE GRIDLOCK.
>> REALITY SHOWS JUST MIGHT BETHE ANSWER TO FINDING MORE
BIPARTISANSHIP ON CAPITOL HILL.
AT LEAST THAT'S THE HOPE OF TWOU.S. SENATORS.
NEW MEXICO DEMOCRAT MARTINHEINRICH  AND ARIZONA REPUBLICAN
JEFF FLAKE SPENT A WEEK TOGETHERON A REMOTE ISLAND FOR A NEW
REALITY SHOW.
IT'S CALLED "RIVAL SURVIVAL."
>> STEPHEN: YES, "RIVALSURVIVAL"!
IT COMBINES THE EXOTIC LOCALESOF THE AMAZING RACE, THE
VOYEURISTIC THRILL OF "BIGBROTHER" AND THE RACIAL
DIVERSITY OF THE BACHELOR.
(LAUGHTER)SO I WANT TO GIVE A TIP OF THE
HAT TO THESE SENATORS FORPROVING REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS "CAN" WORK TOGETHER.
ALL IT TAKES IS THE THREAT OFDEATH.
(LAUGHTER)   JIM?
>> AS WE ARRIVED, CERTAINLYDIDN'T HAVE EITHER THE
CONDITIONS TO CREATE A FIRE ORTHE TIME AND REALLY HAD TO FOCUS
ON THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS WHICHWAS FINDING SOMETHING TO DRINK
AND MAKING SURE WE HAD A SHELTERBECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO
RAIN THROUGH THE NIGHT.
WE FOUND A COCONUT GROVE.
JUST THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OFCOCONUTS.
THAT'S A LOT OF COCONUT WATERWHICH WAS A LIFESAVER TODAY.
WE REALLY NEEDED THAT.
>> STEPHEN: THANK GOD THEYFOUND THOSE COCONUTS.
HOW WOULD THEY POSSIBLY FINDWATER IN THE MIDDLE OF A DRIVING
RAINSTORM?
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE DISCOVERYHAS GONE ALL IN AND COMMITTED
THEM TO A FULL ONE EPISODE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT CONGRESS CAN'T STOP HERE.
THEY CAN COME TOGETHER TOPRODUCE MORE REALITY TV.
I SAY DITCH JOHN BOEHNER, MAKETHE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JEFF
PROBST.
INSTEAD OF BORING LEGISLATION,EVERY MORNING HE'LL PASS OUT
CHALLENGES LIKE BLOCK THE FARMBILL OR YOU HAVE TO EAT A BUG.
(LAUGHTER)MITCH MCCONNELL GETS IMMUNITY
BECAUSE HIS DIET IS ALREADYCRICKETS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT EVEN IF WE DIDN'T TURN
CONGRESS INTO A TELEVISED LORDOF THE FLIES, THERE'S STILL ONE
THING THAT CONGRESS CANALWAYS AGREE ON.
>> THE HOUSE JUST VOTED IN ARARE BIPARTISAN VOTE TO SUPPORT
THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO TRAINTHE MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION.
>> THE SENATE WENT ALONG WITHTHE HOUSE, APPROVING PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S PLAN.
>> A RARE VOTE OF BIPARTISANAPPROVAL.
>> A RARE SHOW OF BIPARTISANSUPPORT.
>> WE CERTAINLY WELCOME THEBIPARTISAN SHOW OF SUPPORT FROM
CONGRESS, THAT IS A PHENOMENONTOO RARE THESE DAYS.
>> WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICA'SNATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICA IS
UNITED.
>> STEPHEN: YES, AMERICANSHAVE PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES
AND COME TOGETHER FOR A GREATERCAUSE -- GIVING DEADLY WEAPONS
TO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE WORLD THAT WE KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT.
(APPLAUSE)ALL I'M SAYING IS "GIVE WAR A
CHANCE."
(LAUGHTER)AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
>> AMERICA IS READY TO BEAMERICA AGAIN.
THAT SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION.
WE'RE TIRED OF BEING BLACKAMERICAN, GAY AMERICAN,
HISPANIC-AMERICAN.
LET'S JUST BE AMERICANS AGAIN.
WE'VE GOT THESE PEOPLE WE HAVETO KILL.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: G-GUT IS JUST
ECHOING THE IMMORTAL WORDS OFDR. KING, "I HAVE BEEN TO THE
MOUNTAINTOP, AND IT WOULD BE AGREAT PLACE TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK.
YOU'VE GOT THE HIGHER GROUND ."
