(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
NATION, WHILE THE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS THE BIG
NEWS HERE IN AMERICA, EUROPE
IS FACING A CRISIS THAT
CANNOT BE IGNORED.
OF COURSE I'M REFERRING TO
NORWAY'S TRIPLING BUTTER
SHORTAGE.
JIM.
>> THE ENTIRE NATION OF
NORWAY IS NOW FACING A
BUTTER CRISIS THANKS TO A
POPULAR NEW LOW CAR BE
FAT-RICH DIET.
WE'RE TOLD EXPECT BUTTER
SALES SOARING 20% THERE IN
OCTOBER AND 30% LAST MONTH.
NOW THE COUNTRY'S ENTIRE
STOCKPILE IS GONE.
>> Stephen: NORWAY HAS NO
BUTTER.
AND THEY HAVE NO HOPE OF
REBUILDING THEIR BUTTER
RESERVES, CONSIDERING HOW
LONG IT TAKES TO MILK A
REINDEER.
THEY KEEP FLYING AWAY.
BUT THE MOST SHOCKING PART
OF THE STORY IS THAT THEY'RE
GOING CRAZY OVER A HIGH FAT
LOW CAR BE DIET.
CLEARLY NORWAY HAS JUST
DISCOVERED AT KINS.
HOW BIG IS THAT TIME
DIFFERENCE?
I JUST HOPE THEY'RE PREPARED
FOR Y2K.
BUT FOLKS, IT'S DEFINITELY
BETTER THAN THEIR LAST FAD
DIET, THE NOR WEDGEAN
HERRING GLENNS WHERE YOU EAT
HERRING ONCE THEN SWEAR OFF
FOOD FOREVER.
NOW WITH BUTTER GOING AS
HIGH AS $740 A BOX, IT IS NO
SURPRISE THAT ON FRIDAY A
RUSSIAN MAN WAS CAUGHT
TRYING TO SMUGGLE 90 KILOS
OVER THE SWEDISH BORDER INTO
NORWAY, 90 KILOS OF BUTTER.
FOR OF ROUGHLY THE
EQUIVALENT OF ONE CINNABON.
NOW BRACE YOURSELF, NORWAY,
BECAUSE ARE YOU ABOUT TO BE
OVERRUN BY THE BUTTER
CARTELS.
DESPERATE BUTTER MULES WILL
BE SWALLOWING CONDOMS FILLED
WITH LAND O LAKES AND
PUSHING THEM ON THE STREETS
OF OSLO TO SPREAD HEADS
TWEAKING ON SHORT BREAD.
BUTTER KING PENS WILL BE
MEETING BY THE DOCKS TO MOVE
BAILS OF FRESH CHURNED
GOLDEN COW, THEN TESTING ITS
PURITY IN THE BACK OF A
TRUCK BY BAKING APPLE
TURNOVERS.
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET UGLY
AND DELICIOUS.
WELL, IN THEIR TIME OF NEED
LET ME JUST SAY TO ALL MY
NORWEGIAN VIEWERS, IN YOUR
FACE, AMERICA WINS AGAIN.
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A
BUTTER-TOPPIA.
WE'VE GOT STICK BUTTER,
TUBBED BUTTER, WHIPPED
BUTTER, HONEY BUTTER AND
SPRAY BUTTER.
WE'VE SO MANY GODDAMN KINDS
OF BUTTER THAT WE HAVE
PRODUCED A PRODUCT CALLED I
CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT
BUTTER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BECAUSE IF YOU
PICK UP RANDOM OBJECT IN THE
UNITED STATES, THERE'S A
GOOD CHANCE IT'S BUTTER.
AT OUR STATE FAIRS WE CARVE
BUTTER INTO HISTORICAL
FIGURES.
WE DEEP-FRY ENTIRE STICKS OF
BUTTER IN OTHER BUTTER.
BUT OF COURSE IF YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT PURE, UNA DULL
TRADED BUTTER FLAVOR I
BELIEVE YOU CANNOT BEAT IT
FRESH ON THE CUB.
HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM.
I TELL YOU WHAT, TELL YOU
WHAT, NORWAY, THAT COULD USE
SOME MORE BUTTER.
HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM,
HMMMM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND YOU KNOW
WHAT, I CAN FEEL THE POUNDS
JUST MELTING OFF.
YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE A GOOD
TIME FOR, A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
