>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
FOUNDER AND FORMER C.E.O. OF
AOL AND A LEADER THERED
SO-CALLED SHARING ECONOMY.
I ASSUME HE DIDN'T
MINDSHARING THE GREEN ROOM
SNACKS WAY CHICKEN.
PLEASE WELCOME STEVE CASE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HEY, MR. CASE.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
NOW OKAY, YOU'RE A LEGEND OF
AMERICAN MODERN TECHNOLOGY.
YOU WERE ONE OF THE
CO-FOUNDERS OF AOL.
YOU SERVED AS CHAIRMAN &
CEO.
LATER BECAME CHAIRMAN OF
TIME WARNER.
AOL TIME WARNER, EXCUSE ME.
IN 2005 YOU LAUNCHED A
COMPANY CALLED REVOLUTION.
OKAY, WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A
MOMENT.
BUT FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT
AOL.
AOL WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
INTRODUCERS OF INTERNET TO
PEOPLE'S LIVES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGISE
TO ALL BUSINESSES FOR THE
LOST WORK HOURS?
OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
[BLEEP] ALL DAY LONG ON THE
INTERNET INSTEAD OF DOING
THEIR JOB?
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU
INTRODUCED THE GREATEST TIME
WASTER OF ALL TIME.
>> WE TEND TO THINK OF IT AS
ONE OF THE GREAT EMPOWERMENT
TOOLS OF ALL TIME BECAUSE
YOU CAN GET INFORMATION IN
NEW WAYS AND GET EDUCATED IN
NEW WAYS BUT WE RECOGNIZE IT
DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT THAT
WAY.
>> Stephen: NOW YOUR NEW
IDEA IS CALLED REVOLUTION.
FOUNDED ALMOST SEVEN YEARS
AGO NOW.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND THIS IS
ABOUT THE SHARING ECONOMY.
IT INCLUDES COMPANIES LIKE
ZIPCAR, LIVING SOCIAL.
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA, IF
YOU DON'T MIND, OF SHARING
I'M ONE OF 11 CHILDREN.
I HAD TO SHARE MY ENTIRE
LIFE.
I'M A BIG BOY NOW.
IT'S MINE.
ISN'T THAT ANTI-THETICAL TO
AMERICAN.
>> NOT REALLY, ACTUALLY THE
HISTORY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE
USED TO SHARE A HUNDRED
YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE GREW
UP IN VILLAGES AND FARMS AND
KNEW THEIR NEIGHBORS.
>> Stephen: WE ALSO DIED AT
43 A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT
THIS IS OWNERSHIP ECONOMY.
>> WHEN YOU KNEW PEOPLE AND
TRUSTED THOSE PEOPLE, AND
HAD A FEELING OF A SENSE OF
COMMUNITY.
DID YOU SHARE.
WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST 50
YEARS, PEOPLE MOVED AROUND,
DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THE
NEIGHBORS BUT WITH THE
INTERNET ARE YOU ABLE TO
RECONNECT SOME OF THOSE
COMMUNITIES AND BUILD SOME
TRUST AND REPUTATION TOOLS
THAT MAKE IT EASIER NOW TO
SHARE THINGS WHETHER IT BE
CARS OR HOMES OR OFFICE
SPACE, A VARIETY OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE THE
MOST POPULAR THINGS FOR
SHARING IN THE SHARING
ECONOMY.
>> ZIP CAR IS ONE OF THE
COMPANIES THAT WE GOT
INVOLVED IN SIX, SEVEN YEARS
AGO.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES IT
WORK.
>> BASICALLY INSTEAD OF
OWNING A CAR IF YOU LIVE IN
A CITY LIKE NEW YORK OR 20
PHIS AROUND THE WORLD AND
200 COLLEGE CAMPUSES YOU
JOIN THIS CLUB AND CAN JUST
USE A CAR WHEN YOU WANT
WITHOUT THE EXPENSE AND
HASSLE OF OWNING A CAR.
MOST CARS ARE ONLY USED 5 OR
10% OF THE TIME.
MOST VACATION HOMES ONLY
USE-- OR 10% OF THE TIME.
>> Stephen: HERE IS THE
PROBLEM WITH THE ZIP CAR.
DOESN'T THAT SPREAD GERMS?
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE YOU GET IN
THERE, AND THE OTHER GUY A
BUTT GERM IS RIGHT THERE.
IT'S LIKE USING A PUBLIC
TOILET.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: WHICH BY THE WAY
WOULD BE A GREAT THING TO
USE A ZIP CAR FOR.
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT
SHARING.
SHARES SEEMS MARXIST.
BECAUSE THE ZIP CAR BELONGS
TO THE WHOLE VILLAGE, YOU
KNOW?
I MEAN YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
FIND A-- IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME YOU CAN LOOK UP
ONE OF MARXIST'S BOOKS IN
THE LIBRARY WHICH IS ANOTHER
PLACE WHERE THINGS ARE
SHARED.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S SORT
OF A SOCIALIST IDEA?
>> NO, NO.
>> Stephen: IT'S A
COLLECTIVE, IT'S A
COLLECTIVE CAR.
>> REMEMBER, COME UNS ARE
RELATED TO COMMUNITY.
AND THE INITIAL-- .
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY I
DON'T BELIEVE IN COMMUNITY
EITHER.
I LIVE ON AN ESTATE.
>> ALL RIGHT, EXCELLENT.
>> NOT IN A COMMUNITY.
>> WELL A LOT OF
PEOPLE-- YOU SHARE.
>> I DO SHARE.
>> I DO.
>> I'M A MEMBER OF ZIP CAR,
A MEMBER OF EXCLUSIVE
RESORTS.
>> YOU WEREN'T THE PRESIDENT
OF IT.
>> SURE.
>> REALLY?
>> IT IS, IF THERE IS A
GENERATIONAL SHIFT I THINK A
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USED TO
OWNERSHIP.
APPARENTLY YOU MIGHT BE ONE
OF THEM THERE ARE MORE AND
MORE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY
LIKE THE IDEA OF SHARING,
NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT SAVES
THEM MONEY BUT THEY ARE PART
OF A COMMUNITY THAT IS AWARE
OF THE ENVIRONMENT, A
GENERATIONAL SHIFT AWAY FROM
OWNERSHIP TO USE AND
EXPERIENCE.
>> I HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH
BUSINESS BASED ON THIS
MODEL.
IT'S CALLED TOASTERSTER,
OKAY.
I ONLY MY TOASTER FOR LIKE A
FEW MINUTES OF THE DAY.
SO WHY SHOULD I OWN A
TOASTER.
>> THAT'S A FAIR POINT.
>> Stephen: HOW IT WILL WORK
IS THERE THAT THERE WILL BE
A CENTRAL LOCATION IN NEW
YORK WHERE ALL THE TOASTERS
ARE KEPT.
AND WILL YOU GO CHECK OUT A
TOASTER FOR LIKE THE FIVE
MINUTES IT TAKES YOU TO MAKE
YOUR TOAST THEN RETURN IT TO
THE CENTRAL LOCATION FOR
LIKE A SMALL FEE.
>> THAT'S AN AWESOME IDEA.
WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT FUNDING THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE
STUPIDEST IDEA.
I COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF.
>> BUT I THINK IF YOU KEEP
WORK ON IT YOU WILL IMPROVE
TON.
>> Stephen: LISTEN, WILL YOU
GIFT ME START UP MONEY.
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUT
WE NEED A HOTTER IDEA THAN
THAT.
>> Stephen: I NEED $25
MILLION.
THANK YOU STEVE CASE, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: INTERNET
ENTREPRENEUR, REVOLUTION.
WE'LL BE
