EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE
A.C.L.U., WHICH MEANS HE WILL
DEFEND TO THE DEATH MY RIGHT TO
CALL HIM ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
I'M ABOUT TO.
PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY ROMERO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, ANTHONY, NICE TO SEE YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK
TO HELP US KICK OFF THE 90th
ANNIVERSARY OF THE A.C.L.U.
YOU'RE SUCH A SWEETHEART TO HAVE
ME HERE TO CELEBRATE 90 YEARS OF
GREAT WORK, CASES WE BROUGHT,
BATTLES WE'VE FOUGHT, THE RIGHT
OF MEN AND WOMEN OF DIFFERENT
RACES TO MARRY.
>> Stephen: I EVEN GOT YOU A
PRESENT.
>> WHAT IS THAT?
>> Stephen: LOOK, IT'S A FIN.
>> THE RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTION,
GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT.
>> Stephen: THE RIGHT TO
CONTRACEPTION.
WHY ARE YOU GOING STRAIGHT INTO
THE GUTTER WITH THIS INTERVIEW.
NOW, I AM NOT HERE TO HELP YOU.
I AM HERE TO GIVE YOU A SOUND
DRUBBING.
THESE ARE THE LATEST THINGS
YOU'VE BEEN YAMMERIG ON ABOUT
AND CLOGGING UP OUR COURT CASES.
OKAY.
YOU RECENTLY FILED A LAWSUIT
THAT CHALLENGES THE OBAMA
STRAIGHT'S PRACTICE OF TARGETED
KILLINGS OF SUSPECTED
TERRORISTS.
>> AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO HAS
NEVER BEEN INDICTED, NO TRIAL,
NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED, HE'S
SUSPECTED OF TERROR IN A FOREIGN
COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN.
>> I SAY WE TAKE HIM OUT WITH A
PREDATOR DRONE.
>> I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.
>> Stephen: I SAY BACKPACKERS
IN EUROPE.
WHY CAN'T WE GO AFTER THESE GUYS
WHO ARE SWORN ENEMIES OF THE
UNITED STATES EVEN IF THEY'RE
AMERICAN CITIZENS BECAUSE THEY
WANT US DEAD.
WE HAVE TO HAVE THEM DEAD.
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE THE
RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE WE'RE AMERICANS, WE
BELIEVE IN DEW POINT, WE BELIEVE
IN EVIDENCE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO EXECUTE AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO IS NOT ON
THE BATTLEFIELD.
HE'S IN YEMEN.
>> Stephen: YEMEN IS A
BATTLEFIELD.
IT'S FULL OF TERRORISTS.
WE SEND PREDATOR DRONE STRIKES
IN THERE ALL THE TIME.
>> IS LONDON A BATTLEFIELD?
>> Stephen: IT HAS BEEN.
I BELIEVE IT'S GRANDFATHERED IN
FROM THE BLITZ.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE WHOLE POINT, THOUGH,
STEPHEN, IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
IS GOING TO TRY TO KILL AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN...
>> Stephen: WHO WANTS TO KILL
YOU, ANTHONY ROMERO, BECAUSE HE
HATES YOUR FREEDOM.
>> THAT'S WHY WE'RE DEFENDING
THE FREEDOM.
>> Stephen: HE'S A SUSPECTED
TERRORIST.
WHY SUSPECT HIM IF HE'S NOT A
TERRORIST?
>> LOOK AT ALL THE SUSPECTED
TERRORISTS AT GUANTANAMO WHO
WERE LATER ON RELEASED.
>> Stephen: YOU AND THE
PRESIDENT WANT TO CLOSE
GUANTANAMO.
DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE IT AS MUCH
AS HE DOES?
>> I THINK...
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH THESE PEOPLE?
>> PUT THEM IN COURT.
GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS.
YOU CHARGE THEM WITH CRIMES.
>> Stephen: CUT THEM LOOSE IN
OUR COURTS.
>> YOU DON'T CUT THEM LOOSE.
YOU HAVE PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE
LAWYERS.
>> Stephen: WE'RE TRYING
DEFEND OURSELVES.
>> MORE THAN 300 TERRORISM
SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
PROSECUTED IN THE FEDERAL
COURTS.
WE CAN DO IT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU WANT A
GROUND ZERO MOSQUE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
LET'S KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE
STONE.
CLOSE GUANTANAMO AND MOVE THEM
ALL INTO THE GROUND ZERO MOSQUE.
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT
THING IS FULL OF TERRORISTS
ANYWAY.
LET THEM OPEN IT AND PUT A
PADLOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR.
>> LISTEN, STEPHEN, WHAT'S MOST
IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT PEOPLE
HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTEST THE
MOSQUE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THEY HAVE AN
OBLIGATION.
>> BUT, BUT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE RAMPANT ANTI-MUSLIM
SENTIMENT IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
THE XENOPHOBIA WE SEE AGAINST
MUSLIMS IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST MUSLIMS.
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST MUSLIMS.
I BELIEVE IT'S A GREAT RELIGION
FOLLOWED BY MOHAMMED, PEACE BE
UPON HIS NAME, BUT YOU CANNOT
DENY THEY'RE OUT TO KILL US.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: IT FEELS... IT
FEELS... THEY FEEL SCARY.
>> MUSLIMS ARE NOT OUT THE KILL
US.
>> Stephen: THEY FEEL SCARY.
YOU'LL ADMIT THAT.
THEY HAVE BEARDS.
THEY DON'T WEAR BELTS OFTEN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THEY'RE NO MORE SCARY.
WE CANNOT...
>> Stephen: DID YOU SAY NO
MORE SCARY THAN CATHOLICS?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
ARE YOU CATHOLIC?
>> I WAS ONCE.
>> Stephen:, NO YOU ARE STILL
A CATHOLIC.
>> THE POPE RELEASED ME AS A GAY
MAN.
>> Stephen: HE DIDN'T RELEASE
YOU.
HE CONDEMNED YOU.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> I LOVE THE POPE.
>> Stephen: YOUR ORGANIZATION
FIGHTS TO SUPPORT THE
CONSTITUTION, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DO.
FOR 90 YEARS.
>> Stephen: WHY DO WE NEED THE
A.C.L.U. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE
TEA PARTY?
BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT THE
CONSTITUTION.
DO THEY NOT?
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
>> IT DEPENDS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THEY
SAY.
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ALL THEY
SAY, SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION.
>> SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION,
SHUT DOWN ALL THESE DEBATES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DEBATES?
>> DEBATES ABOUT GAY RIGHTS.
ARE THEY FOR GAY RIGHTS?
>> Stephen: WE CAN STILL
DEBATE IT.
YOU'RE WRONG.
THAT'S A DEBATE.
>> THAT'S NOT REAL DEBATE.
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT
WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
OF OUR TIME, CLOSING GUANTANAMO,
MAKING SURE WE DON'T ATTACK
AMERICAN CITIZENS USING DRONES
WITH NO DEW DUE PROCESS.
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TARGETS
AMERICAN CITIZENS FOR DEATH.
WE DON'T GET TO COME BACK.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S AFRAID THEIR NAME IS
ON THE LIST.
>> THERE IS.
THERE IS ONE FELLOW WHO IS OUR
CLIENT.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
IT'S LIKE SHAKING THE HAND OF
DEATH HIMSELF.
ANTHONY RO
