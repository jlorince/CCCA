THANK YOU, FOLKS.
NATION, NATION, WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS AN IMPENDING ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER LOOMING
RIGHT OFF OUR NATION'S FRAGILE COASTLINE.
I'M SPEAKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT THE NEW WIND FARM OFF OF CAPE COD THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION JUST APPROVED.
A WIND FARM?
DO YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS?
WHAT IF IT BREAKS AND WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC WIND SPILL.
THE LAST ONE NEARLY DESTROYED NEW ORLEANS.
SPEAKING OF LOUISIANA, THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE STORY THAT CAUGHT MY EYE, THE EXPLOSION OF AN
OFF-SHORE OIL RIG WHICH RESULTED IN CRUDE OIL BEING PUSMGED INTO THE OCEAN.
THE OCEAN HASN'T SEEN THAT MUCH OIL SINCE THE CAST OF "JERSEY
SHORE" ALL WENT SWIMMING AT THE SAME TIME.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND... I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE FUSS
THAT IS BEING MADE OVER SPILLING A LITTLE OIL INTO THE OCEAN.
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT 42,000 GALLONS A DAY.
>> THE COAST GUARD SAYS IT MAY ACTUALLY BE FIVE TIMES THAT,
210,000 GALLONS A DAY.
>> Stephen: OH.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, WHAT IS THAT, LIKE 80 MILES OF TOXIC SLUDGE?
>> 600 MILES OF TOXIC SLUDGE.
>> Stephen: STILL, WHAT'S THAT, THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND?
>> A SWATH OF OIL THAT'S NOW BIGGER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.
>> Stephen: FINE.
THE OCEAN IS A BIG PLACE.
IF YOU FLOATED DELAWARE OUT THERE, YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE IT.
>> SO BIG NOW YOU CAN SEE IT FROM SPACE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WELL, REGARDLESS OF HOW BIG IT, IS IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILES OFF SHORE.
>> 15 MILES FROM SHORE.
>> Stephen: GOOD.
GOOD.
THEN WE CAN GET TO IT AND STOP IT FROM REACHING LAND.
>> I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO STOP THIS OIL FROM REACHING LAND.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BUT, EVEN IF IT MAKES LAUGH, WHAT'S IT GOING TO DO?
>>EN CREDIBLE DEVASTATION TO THE ESTUARY ECOSYSTEM OF LOUISIANA.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BUT THIS IS ALL PART OF "DRILL, BABY,
DRILL." NOW AND THEN YOU GET AN OIL SLICK THE SIZE OF DELAWARE GROWING BY 210 GALLONS A DAY
THAT WILL DEVASTATE ALL THE LOCAL WILDLIFE AND CAN'T BE STOPPED.
THE THING TO REMEMBER IS EVENTUALLY NATURE WILL WORK THIS THING OUT BECAUSE TIME IS ON OUR SIDE.
>> TIME IS NOT ON ANYBODY'S SIDE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY JUST CALM DOWN.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE'S NO NEED TO GET HEATED,
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT A HEAT SOURCE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT THING.
IT WILL EXPLODE.
I'LL TELL YOU, FOLKS, I TELL YOU WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS.
THIS OIL SPILL IS GOING TO GIVE LIFTY ENVIRONMENTALISTS LIKE BARACK OBAMA CHANCE TO SAY, I
TOLD YOU SO.
>> IT TURNS OUT, BY THE WAY,
THAT OIL RIGS TODAY GENERALLY DON'T CAUSE SPILLS.
>> Stephen: OH.
[LAUGHTER]
I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
SO IF YOU'RE HEADING TO THE BEACH THIS WEEKEND IN LOU||||
