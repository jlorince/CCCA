>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERYMUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, YOU KNOW, I WAS DRAWINGON THIS PIECE OF PAPER.
HERE'S THE THING...
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]GOD, I LOVE YOU.
NATION I LIKE AT, BUT I DON'TALWAYS GET IT.
I'VE STARED AT ANDREW WYETH'S"CHRISTINA'S WORLD" FOR HOURS,
BUT MY EYES CAN NEVER UNFOCUS TOSEE THE T-REX AND THE VOLCANO,
AND AS MUCH AS I ENJOY ART,SOMETIMES IT'S THE CRAZIEST
[BLEEPED] THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
FOLKS, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,WHENEVER YOU SEE MASTERPIECES BY
SOMEONE LIKE VINCENT VAN GOGH,WHETHER IT BE "STARRY NIGHT" OR
"SUNFLOWERS," IT ALWAYS MAKESYOU ASK THE BIG QUESTIONS LIKE:
WHAT WOULD HIS CHOPPED-OFF EARLOOK LIKE?
WELL, WONDER NO LONGER.
>> WOULD YOU PAY TO SEE A HUMANEAR IN AN ART MUSEUM?
THE EAR OF ARTIST VINCENT VANGOGH IS ABOUT TO GO ON DISPLAY.
IN 1888, THE DUTCH ARTIST HAD APSYCHOTIC BREAKDOWN AND
INEXPLICABLY SEVERED HIS OWNEAR.
NOW A GERMAN MUSEUM HAS AREPLICA OF THE EAR USING CELLS
ACTUALLY GROWN FROM VAN GOGH'SGREAT, GREAT NEPHEW.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THAT EXCITING TIME IN EVERYCENTURY WHEN GERMAN MUSEUMS
BEGIN DISPLAYING HUMAN BODYPARTS.
FOLKS, AND THIS ONE REALLYDISGUSTS ME.
THERE'S YOUR EUROPEAN STYLESOCIALIZED MEDICINE.
VAN GOGH HAD TO WAIT 126 YEARSTO GET HIS EAR FIXED.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NOW, ACCORDING TO THE "EARTIST,"
DIEMUT STREBE, THE STILL-ALIVESTILL LIFE WAS CREATED BY USING
CELLS FROM LIEUWE VAN GOGH, THEGREAT, GREAT GRANDSON OF
VINCENT'S BROTHER THEO TO GROWTHE EAR AND A 3-D PRINTER
TO SHAPE IT. AND IF YOU THINK APAPER JAM IS TOUGH, TRY
CLEARING OUT AN EAR JAM.
NATION, THIS IS THE MOSTSUCCESSFUL USE OF BIOENGINEERING
IN ART SINCE PABLO PICASSOCREATED THAT FIVE-BOOBED LADY SO
HE COULD PAINT HER.
IT COULD VERY WELL USHER IN AWHOLE NEW MOVEMENT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
USING THIS SAME TECHNOLOGY, WEMIGHT FINALLY BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT THIS GUY'S FACE LOOKED LIKEBEFORE IT WAS MANGLED IN A
HORRIBLE APPLE-PICKING ACCIDENT.
OR EVEN BETTER, EVEN BETTER, WECAN FINALLY GLIMPSE THE VENUS DE
MILO AS SHE WAS MEANT TO BE.
AND THE BEST PART ABOUT THISEXHIBIT IS THAT VISITORS CAN
TALK TO IT.
>> VISITORS TO A GERMAN MUSEUMARE WAITING IN LINE FOR HOURS,
LITERALLY TO ASK QUESTIONSTHROUGH A MICROPHONE TO VINCENT
VAN GOGH'S RE-GROWN EAR.
THINK OF YOUR QUESTION FOR VANGOGH'S EAR, PLEASE.
>> Stephen: I'VE GOT ONE: WHY,GOD, WHY?
BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN EARS GROW ONCORN.
I HAVE SEEN EARS GROWN ON MICE.
BUT AN EAR GROWING IN A MUSEUM,THAT'S THE CRAZIEST [BLEEPED]
THING I HAVE EVER HEARD.
