>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME TO
"THE REPORT," EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
FOLKS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING
GOOD.
SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING
GOOD, AND IF YOU'RE NOTTIC --
NOT, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS TO
REPORT, TONIGHT JUSTICE HAS BEEN
SERVED FOR A COLD-BLOODED KILLER
WHO HAS BEEN AT LARGE FOR OVER
150 YEARS.
OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
PATHOGEN THAT CAUSED THE IRISH
POTATO FAMINE.
SCIENTISTS IN ENGLAND EXTRACTED
D.N.A. FROM 19th CENTURY
PLANT SAMPLES TO IDENTIFY THE
DISEASE AT LONG LAST, AND JUST
AS I SUSPECTEDDED, IT WAS THE
PHYTOPHTHORA NFESTANS HERB-1
STRAIN.
AND I BET ALL YOU ARMCHAIR
EPIDEMOLOGISTS WHO THOUGHT IT
WAS THE 1-B HAPLOTYPE FEEL LIKE
[BLEEPED] NOW.
NOW, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT P. INFESTANS HERE IS A
FUNGAL INFECTION, MEANING ALL
THE POTATOES IN IRELAND
BASICALLY HAD JOCK ITCH.
THE WHOLE THING COULD HAVE BEEN
AVOIDED WITH A SINGLE CAN OF
CRUEX.
INSTEAD IT WAS THE WORST PLAGUE
TO HIT THE IRISH SINCE WHATEVER
KEEPS DESTROYING MICHAEL
FLATLY'S SHIRTS.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WIPED OUT A MILLION OF MY
COUNTRYMEN, AND WORSE, IT FORCED
LUCKY CHARMS TO START PUTTING
MARSHMALLOWS IN ITS CEREAL
INSTEAD OF DELICIOUS POTATOES.
NOT TO MENTION, HAVING LOST ALL
THEIR POTATOES, THE IRISH HAD NO
WAY TO POWER THEIR CLOCKS.
