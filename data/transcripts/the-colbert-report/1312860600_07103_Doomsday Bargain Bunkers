>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, PLEASE, FOLKS, I
KNOW THAT THINGS MAY LOOK
BLEAK BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT
THIS WHOLE S&P CLOUD HAS A
SILVER LINING WHICH AS A
COMMODITY IS NOW WORTH MORE
THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR.
BUT YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR
WHEN I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE
FIVE STAR VIVOS UNDERGROUND
BUNKER, AN OPULENT
SUBTERRANEAN SANCTUARY WHERE
FOR $50 GRAND YOU COULD LIVE
IN THE AFTERLAP OF LUXURY
BASKING IN AMENITIES SUCH AS
QUEEN SIZE BEDS, A FULLY
STOCKED WINE CELL AR,
DECORATIVE ARTWORK, PET
KENNELS, DENTAL SERVICES AND
A HAIR SALON BECAUSE WHEN
JESUS RETURNS YOU WANT
PERFECT VENEERS AN AN UP-DO.
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
>> THIS BUNKER LOOKS MORE
LIKE A NICE HOTEL AWAY FROM
HOME, COMPLETE WITH AN
ATRIUM, A GYM IT EVEN SERVES
SLOPPY JOES.
>> Stephen: SLOPPY JOES.
BECAUSE EVEN IN THE END
TIMES AMERICANS WILL NEVER
GIVE UP THEIR EASILY GUMBO
MEAT SLUSH.
NOW--
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, NOW VIVOS HAS A NEW
PRODUCT FOR MORE MODEST
AFTERSCAPE VIGILANTES.
>> VIVOS SAYS THAT
TWO-THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE
INTERESTED IN ITS BUNKERS
CAN'T COME UP WITH THE CASH
FOR THE HIGH-END VERSION.
SO THEY'VE SCALED BACK THEIR
DESIGN AND RELEASED WHAT
THEY CALL AN ECONOMY CLASS
OPTION.
IT'S CALLED THE VIVOS 1,000
AND IT'S AN UNDERGROUND
COMPLEX THAT CAN HOLD UP TO
1,000 PEOPLE.
IT COSTS AROUND $10 GRAND
PER PERSON TO SHARE A ROOM
WITH THREE OTHER DOOMSDAY
BELIEVERS.
>> Stephen: IN OTHER WORDS,
IT'S LIKE FRESHMAN YEAR AT
BOB JONES UNIVERSITY.
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THIS BARGAIN BUNKER,
THIS BARGAIN BUNKER IS A
GREAT IDEA.
BECAUSE EVEN WHAT VIVOS
CALLS THE MASSES DESERVE TO
BRIEFLY EXTEND THEIR LIVES
IN A WINDOWLESS TOMB.
NOW NATURALLY, THERE ARE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HIGH
END LINE AND THE BUDGET
VIVOS 1,000.
THE VIVOS 1,000 CRAMS TWICE
THE PEOPLE NOT SAME AMOUNT
OF SPACE, DOORS ARE MADE OF
CURTAINS, PERSONAL STORAGE
IS MINIMAL AND INSTEAD OF A
FIRST CLASS COMPLETE
WARDROBE, YOU ARE EQUIPPED
WITH COMFORT SWEATS.
BASICALLY WHAT MOST
AMERICANS WEAR ANYWAY
WITHOUT THE WORD JUICY ON
THEIR ASS.
AND INSTEAD OF GUARANTEEING
SURVIVAL FOR OVER A YEAR,
THE ECONOMY MODEL CONTAINS
ONLY ENOUGH FOOD AND FUEL
FOR SIX MONTHS MAXIMUM.
WHICH MEANS BY MONTH SEVEN
YOU EITHER HAVE TO GET OUT
OR BECOME THE LUXURY
BUNKER'S SLOPPY JOES.
BUT EVEN 10,000 DOLLARS CAN
BE A LOT TO SWALLOW IN THIS
ECONOMY.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE PARTNERED
WITH THE PEOPLE AT PRESCOTT
SURVIVAL TO BRING YOU AN
EVEN MORE ECONOMICAL
UNDERGROUND SAFE HAVEN.
AND THIS ONE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHARE.
THE LIVE BOX TEN.
FOR JUST 30 INSTALLMENTS OF
9.99 YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF
THESE PERSONAL LIFE
EXTENSION CONTAINERS SHIPPED
RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR.
NOW IN CASE OF APOCALYPSE
SIMPLY DIG A SIX FOOT HOLE
IN YOUR BACKYARD, PLACE
YOURSELF IN THE LIVE BOX AND
HAVE YOUR LOVED ONES LOWER
YOU GENTLY TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE SURVIVAL COMFORT ZONE.
ONCE INSIDE, PUT ON YOUR
FREE TERRI CLOTH GENITAL
COMFORT FLAP AND FEAST ON A
TWO-WEEK SUPPLY OF DRIED
SURVIVAL NUGGETS WITH CHUNKS
OF SAVORY BEEF FLAVOR.
AND TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM
LOOTERS AND SOIL VARMINTS
WITH OUR PATENTED LIFESAVING
BROKEN SHOVEL HANDLE.
AND FOR JUST $600 MORE YOU
CAN ALSO HAVE A STATE OF THE
ART SURVIVAL MARKER ENGRAVED
WITH YOUR NAME AND YOUR DATE
OF ENTRY SO THAT FUTURE
GENERATIONS CAN FIND AND
REANIMATE YOU WHEN THE U.S.
ECONOMY HAS REBOUNDED.
ORDER NOW, SUPPLIES ARE
LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF
FREEZERS WE FIND DUMPED IN
THE WOODS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
