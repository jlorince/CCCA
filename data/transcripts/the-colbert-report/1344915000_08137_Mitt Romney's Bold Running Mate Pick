OH, HI, THANKS, STEPHEN, HI,
WELCOME ABOARD.
WELCOME WELCOME MY FRIEND TO THE BRIDGE --
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, AMERICANS, WELCOME TO THE BRIDGE OF THE INTREPID
WHERE THIS WEEK I'LL BE BROADCASTING FROM AN EXACT REPLICA OF MY-- IT WAS
EXPENSIVE, WASTEFUL AND DESTROYED HISTORIC NAVAL ARTIFACTS BUT IT WAS WORTH
IT BECAUSE IT IS MY JOB TO KEEP YOU INFERRED ON THE STORIES YOU CARE ABOUT.
I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN IN MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS THAT THE REPUBLICANS
HAVE BEEN LETING THIS ELECTION GET AWAY FROM THEM.
BUT WORRY NO MORE.
BECAUSE SATURDAY MORNING MITT ROMNEY MADE THE MOST IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER.
>> IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PAUL RYAN.
>> Stephen: PAUL RYAN FOR PRESIDENT!
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
OH, WHOOO!
WHAT A RELIEVE.
BECAUSE FOR NINE MONTHS NOW I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, I WAS WORRIED.
YOU GOT ME!
YOU GOT ME!
OH MY GOD!
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO FACE T BECAUSE THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT-- I'M SORRY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
>> HOLD ON, HOLD ON, EVERY NOW AND THEN I'M KNOWN TO MAKE A MISTAKE.
(LAUGHTER) SI DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE WITH THIS GUY.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen: HA, HA, HA, HA,
HA!
I MEAN ROMNEY-RYAN 2012.
VERY EXCITED, YES.
MITT ROMNEY PICKED WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN AND FOLKS THIS IS NO SAFE CHOICE.
NO THERE WAS ANOTHER WORD FOR IT.
>> PAUL RYAN IS BEING CALLED A BOLD CHOICE.
>> THIS WAS A BIG, BOLD,
COURAGEOUS CHOICE.
>> VERY BOLD PICK.
>> A BIG BOLD CHOICE.
>> ROMNEY GOES BOLD.
>> THE BOLD FLAVOR YOU'RE CRAVING.
>> Stephen: YES, HMMMM.
BOLD!
BOLD!
I MEAN SO DARING.
I MEAN WHITE CHRISTIAN AND MALE?
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A TRIPLE NOT THREATENING TO ME.
AND OF COURSE KNOWN NO ONE IS MORE HISTORIC ABOUT RYAN THAN THE KIDS.
>> THERE COULD BE A GENERATIONAL UPSIDE.
THE 42-YEAR-OLD RYAN WHO WAS JOINED ON STAGE BY HIS WIFE AND SMALL CHILDREN COULD
HELP THE GOP APPEAL TO YOUNGER VOTERS.
>> Stephen: OH YES, THE YOUNG ONES LOVE HIM.
AFTER ALL, HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOIS BUDGET COMMITTEE.
OR AS THE KIDS CALL IT, THE BUDGE.
I MEAN THIS DUDE WANTS TO CUT GOVERNMENT ENTIZZLEMENTS.
AND OF COURSE, LIKE ALL REPUBLICAN VP PICKS, HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE TINA FEY!
I CANNOT WAIT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE SNL THIS FALL.
SEE, THE KIDS ARE DOWN WITH RYAN'S BUDGE AND HOW DOPE IT IS THAT IT ELIMINATES THE
CAPITAL GAINS TAX WHICH MEANS THAT UNDER THE ROMNEY-RYAN PLAN, ROMNEY WOULD PAY A TAX RATE OF 0.82%.
RYAN GIVES OUT ALL THESE TAX CUTS COULD BALLOONING THE DEFINITE KNIT.
WE JUST HAVE TO CUT ALL NONMILITARY SPENDING BY 91% OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS.
AND WE WILL NEED THAT DEFENSE SPENDING TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THE GANGS OF MARAUDING SENIORS.
PILLAGING FOR LIPITOR.
NOW RYAN'S BUDGET REPLACES MEDICARE WITH A VOUCHER PROGRAM AND I BELIEVE SOCIAL
SECURITY BECOMES A LOTTERY WHICH WILL SAVE THE GOVERNMENT TONS OF MONEY BECAUSE IF YOUR MONTHLY
CHECK HAS A BLACK DOT, WE STONE YOU TO DEATH.
ROMNEY AND RYAN HAVE THAT SPECIAL CHEMISTRY.
I MEAN HERE THEY ARE ON THE TRAIL TOGETHER WEARING PLAYED SHIRTS TOGETHER.
WEARING WHITE SHIRTS,
WEARING BLUE SHIRTS.
AND HERE THEY ARE WEARING LIKE RA.
>> WHAT'S EVERYBODY LOOKING AT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I'M LOOKING AT A WINNER.
OF COURSE THIS WASN'T GREAT NEWS FOR EVERYONE,
SPECIFICALLY VICE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS LIKE TIM PAWLENTY AND ROB PORTMAN
IT IS TOUGH NEWS TO BREAK TO A POTENTIAL RUNNING MATE BUT MITT'S A LEADER SO HE HAD
HIS SON DO IT.
>> MITT ROMNEY'S OLDEST STONE WAS THE PERSON TO GIVE THE NEWS TO ROB PORTMAN AND
TIM PAWLENTY THAT THEY WERE NOT THE PICK.
>> Stephen: THEY SHOULD BE HONORED.
CRIST CRISTIE GOT A CALL FROM RAFALCA.
I BELIEVE--  (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE WE HAVE A RECORDING.
>> HELLO Z I GET THE JOB.
>> NEY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL FOUND OUT JUST NOW FROM ME.
I'M SO SORRY, GOVERNOR.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
