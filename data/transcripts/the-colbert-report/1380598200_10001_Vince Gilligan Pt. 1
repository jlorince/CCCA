>> Stephen: I WASN'T FISHING,BUT IT TOOK YOU ALMOST 90
SECONDS TO SAY THAT.
(LAUGHTER)LET'S TALK ABOUT WALTER FOR A
SECOND.
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THISEVIL GUY IN YOUR HEAD FOR OVER
SIX YEARS NOW.
IS IT GOING TO BE HARD TO GETHIM OUT OF THERE?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S -- YEAH, I THINK IT WILL BEHARD.
MY WRITERS, MY SIX WRITERS AND ISPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING
ABOUT THIS GUY AND, YEAH, HE'S ATOUGH GUY TO HAVE STUCK IN YOUR
HEAD FOR 24 HOURS A DAY, SIXYEARS STRAIGHT.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE ASK MESOMETIMES, LIKE, WHEN DID WALTER
LOSE YOU?
HE NEVER LOST ME.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: I WAS WITH HIM TOTHE VERY END.
IT ALL MADE SENSE TO ME.
>> OKAY, GOOD, GOOD.
>> Stephen: DIDN'T ALWAYS ROOTFOR HIM BUT IT ALWAYS MADE SENSE
TO ME.
>> YEAH, NOW THAT'S -- I'M GLAD.
HE ALWAYS MADE SENSE TO ME, TOO.
IF THE CHARACTER NEVER MADESENSE TO US AS WRITERS OR TO
BRYAN CRANSTON AS THE GUYPLAYING HIM THAT WOULD BE TOUGH
TO -- HE NEVER LOST US THAT WAY.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU ROOTINGFOR HIM?
>> THERE WAS TIMES IT BECAMEEXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ROOT FOR
HIM BECAUSE HE WAS KIND OF ABASTARD A LOT OF TIMES.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINKIS THE MOST EVIL THING HE DID?
WHEN HE BROKE BAD, WHAT'S THEWORST HE BROKE IN YOUR OPINION?
>> I THINK NASTIEST THING HEEVER DID-- SPOILER ALERT IF YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN IT-->> Stephen: HOLD ON ONE
SECOND.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED,I TELL YOU WHAT, MUTE YOUR
TELEVISION, GO TO YOUTUBE ANDWATCH THIS VIDEO OF A GET TO
HAVING A BATH FOR THE FIRSTTIME.
(LAUGHTER)WHEN WE FINISH SPOILING, I'LL
HOLD THE UNMUTE SIGN UP.
(LAUGHTER)OKAY, ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONE.
WE'RE GONE.
LET RIP.
LET RIP.
>> YOU KNOW E WHAT?
IT WAS TWO EPISODES AGO, IT WASAN EPISODE THAT WAS THE MOMENT
WHERE WALT SAID TO JESSE WITHAPPARENT GLEE "I WATCHED JANE
DIE.
SHE CHOKED TO DEATH AND I COULDHAVE SAVED HER AND I DIDN'T."
I THINK THAT WAS THE MOSTSADISTIC NASTY THING.
>> Stephen: WORSE THANWATCHING HER DIE AND NOT
HELPING?
(LAUGHTER)>> YES, YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT HEWATCHED HER DIE THERE WAS A LOT
OF CONFLICTING EMOTIONS GOING ONIN HIS FACE AND HE IS -- HE
DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT BUT HETHINKS IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR
JESSE BECAUSE SHE'S HICKED HIMON HEROIN -- HOOKED HIM ON
HEROIN AND YOU SEE HE DOESN'TWANT TO DO IT.
BUT PURE SADISM IS NOT SOMETHINGWALT -- ODDLY ENOUGH, WITH ALL
THE EVIL THINGS HE DID HE WASNOT PURELY SADISTIC VERY OFTEN.
AT THAT TIME THAT WAS THE MOSTSADISTIC, I THINK, TELLING JESSE
THAT HE WATCHED.
>> Stephen: WHY-- AGAIN,SPOILER ALERT.
WHY KILL WALT OFF AT THE END?
I MEAN, WHY NOT KEEP HIM GOINGAT LEAST IN "THE WALKING DEAD"?
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW, JUST MOVE HIM OVER TO
THE NEXT PROJECT.
(LAUGHTER)HE'LL GET EVEN SMARTER FROM
EATING ALL THOSE BRAINS!
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT IS A GOOD THOUGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY DID YOU DECIDEHE HAD TO GO?
>> IT SEEMED LIKE THE IMPLICITPROMISE IN THE SHOW FROM THE
FIRST EPISODE.
THE FIRST EPISODE HE IS TOLD HEHAS TWO YEARS TO LIVE
THEREABOUTS.
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD --WE SHOULD ADHERE TO OUR PROMISE
WE IMPOLICEDLY MADE THE AUDIENCE-- MAYBE NOT IMPLICITLY,
EXPLICITLY.
>> Stephen: HE'S GOT CANCER ATTHE BEGINNING.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: DOES HE BECOME ACANCER?
(LAUGHTER)>> I THINK HE ACTUALLY DOES.
I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENTPOINT.
>> Stephen: WAS THAT DEEP OFME?
WAS I DEEP JUST NOW?
(LAUGHTER)>> EXTREMELY DEEP.
>> Stephen: WILL YOU HOLD ON?
I'D LOVE TO TALK A LITTLE BITMORE.
I'LL GET MORE DEEPNESS.
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A COMMERCIALBREAK AND WE'LL COME BACK AND
TALK MORE.
>> RIGHT ON.
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK WITH MORE VINCE GILLIGAN
"BREAKING BAD."
