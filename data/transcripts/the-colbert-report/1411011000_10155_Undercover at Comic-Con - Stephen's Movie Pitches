>> NO, THE BANANA IS FRIENDSWITH JESUS, STARTS OFF AS A
STORY ABOUT JESUS AS ALITTLE BOY.

GOD TURNS A BANANA INTO AMAN AND HE IS A MANANA AND
THEY HAVE FUN TOGETHER.

THE ATHEIST LAWYER THINKSHE'S WON BUT WHAT HAPPENED
IS, IS THAT BACK IN JESUS'STIME THEY END UP CRUCIFYING
THE BANANA, OKAY.
AND ALL OF MANKIND IS SAVEDBY THE BANANA BECAUSE HE
KNEW ALL OF JESUS'STEACHINGS AND SAVED
EVERYBODY ANYWAY.
