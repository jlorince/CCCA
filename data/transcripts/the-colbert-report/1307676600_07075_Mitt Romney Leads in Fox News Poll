BIG ELECTION NEWS.
LAST WEEK MITT ROMNEY WENT
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND
DECLARED HIS INTENTIONS.

BELIEVE IN AMERICA.
AND I AM RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MITT ROMNEY MAY
NOT BE MY FAVORITE CANDIDATE
BUT I CAN SAY THIS, HE'S
ALSO NOT MY SECOND OR THIRD
FAVORITE CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: HE'S HOVERING
ABOUT FIVE OR SIX DEPENDING
ON WHETHER TED NUGENT JUMPS
IN.
♪ ♪.
>> Stephen: HE IS THE ONLY
CANDIDATE WHOSE HEALTH PLAN
COVERS CAT SCRATCH FEVER.
THE PROBLEM IS AS A MORMON,
ROMNEY'S NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE
ALCOHOL, CAFFEINE OR
CHARISMA.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMNEY COULDN'T EVEN KEEP
THE ATTENTION OF THE
CAMERAMAN.
THERE'S MITT MAKING HIS
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE'S
RUNNING-- AND WE'VE LOST THE
CAMERAMAN.
OKAY, I KNOW IT'S-- WHITE
AND IT'S LARGE.
HE WANTS THE OTHER WHITE
THING.
PAN DOWN, THERE WE GO, OH,
WE'VE LOST HIM AGAIN.
COME ON, HE'S GOING TO BE
PRESIDENT, PAN DOWN THERE
YOU GO, THERE IT IS.
OKAY.
NOW ZOOM IN, ZOOM IN ON MITT

OKAY, COME ON, COME ON,
FOCUS, THERE IT IS.
NOW GRAB THE LENS, TWIST IT,
ZOOM IN ON THE GUY WHO'S
TALKING, ZOOM N LET'S SEE
THE FACE OF THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

GO.
THERE'S THE MAN.
THERE'S MITT.
ALL RIGHT NOW JUST FOCUS ON
THE-- OKAY, WE'VE
LOST-- WE'VE LOST--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HE FOUND SOMETHING MORE
INTERESTING.
IF I WERE MITT ROMNEY I
WOULD GIVE MY NEXT SPEECH AT
A TURTLENECK FACTORY.
STILL, EVIDENTLY SOMEBODY
LIKES ROMNEY.
>> THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL
SHOWS MITT ROMNEY
MAINTAINING A HEALTHY 10
POINT LEAD OVER THE REST OF
THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL FIELD.
>> NEW POLL FINDS ROMNEY
BREAKING AWAY FROM THE PACK
WITH 25% SUPPORT AMONG
REPUBLICANS.
THE REST OF THE CANADIANS
ARE IN SINGLE DIGITS.çó
>> Stephen: AND IF HISTORY
IS ANY GUIDE, NO MATTER HOW
MUCH THEY des PIECE THEIR
PARTY'S FRONT-RUNNER,
REPUBLICAN VOTERS EVENTUALLY
DO THE RIGHT THING.
CLOSE THEIR EYES, HOLD THEIR
NOSE, GET IN THAT BOOTH AND
YANK THE LEVER.
