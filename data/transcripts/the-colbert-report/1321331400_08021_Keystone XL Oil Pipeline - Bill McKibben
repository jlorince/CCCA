NATION, I HAVE GOT SOME
GREAT NEWS.
WE SOLVED THE GLOBAL WARMING
CRISIS!
JIMMY, DROP THE STYROFOAM!
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
WE DID IT!
WHOOO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CLEAN UP THIS MESS REAL
QUICK, HOLD ON, LET ME
JUST--
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: -- SCRIPT SEEMS
TO BE MISSING.
SO HOW DID WE DO IT?
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY?
CARBON SEQUESTERING?
NO, THE BEST ANSWER IS
ALWAYS THE SIMPLIST.
WE STOPPED CARING.
(LAUGHTER)
WE MUST HAVE.
WHY ELSE WOULD WE BE
PLANNING THE PROPOSED
KEYSTONE X-L PIPELINE THAT
WILL TRANSPORT CRUDE OIL
FROM ALBERTA'S RICH TAR
SANDS THROUGH A 1700 MILE
UNDERGROUND TUBE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO REFINERIES ON THE
TEXAS COAST.
AND IT'S ALL THE SWEETER
THAT THIS OIL IS COMING FROM
CANADA.
I MEAN WHO HASN'T LOOKED AT
THEIR HOT NEIGHBOR AND
THOUGHT YEAH, I'D TAP THAT.
PLUS--
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS THIS PIPELINE WILL GUSH
OUT A RESOURCE EVEN MORE
PRECIOUS THAN OIL.
>> THE KEYSTONE PROJECT
WOULD GENERATE 20,000
IMMEDIATE JOBS.
>> WOULD WOULD CREATE AT
LEAST 50,000 JOBS.
>> IN TOTAL ABOUT 118,000 IN
DIRECT JOBS.
>> I GATHER TO THE PRESIDENT
LET THE KEYSTONE X-L
PIPELINE GO THROUGH, WILL
CREATE 120,000 JOBS.
>> THIS IS THE KEYTONE X-L
PIPELINE SOME ESTIMATES
COULD PRODUCE UP TO EYE
MILLION NEW HIGH-PAYING JOBS.
>> Stephen: AND THOSE
NUMBERS COME FRESH FROM THE
PIPE-LINE THOSE EXPERTS
BUILT FROM THEIR ASS
STRAIGHT TO THE AIRWAVES.
BUT--
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, BARACK OBAMA HAS
DELAYED APPROVAL OF THE
PIPELINE, KILLING BILLIONS
OF JOBS BECAUSE HE IS COW
TOWING TO ENVIRONMENTAL
ENVIRONMENTALLIST-- WHO
PROTESTED ON THE WHITE HOUSE
LAST WEEK WHERE.
DO THEY GET OFF.
HERE TO TELL ME WHERE THEY
GET OFF IS AUTHOR,
ENVIRONMENTALIST AND ONE OF
THE ORGANIZERS OF THE
KEYSTONE X-L PROTEST, BILL
McKIBON.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US TODAY.
OKAY, BILL.
(APPLAUSE)
THE PRESIDENT HAS DELAYED
THE APPROVAL OF THIS
PIPELINE.
HE'S KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE
ROAD.
ALL BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM
GUYS LIKE YOU.
ARE YOU SELL OPERATING ALL
THE LOSS OF JOBS IN DO YOU
HAVE SOME HYBRID VEHICLE
THAT RUNS ON BROKEN DREAMS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE TRUTH IS THE ONLY
STUDY OF THIS PIPELINE NOT
FUNDED BY TRANS-CANADA, THE
COMPANY THAT WANTED TO BUILD
IT.
>> Stephen: THEY SHOULD KNOW
IT'S THEIR PIPELINE BUT GO
AHEAD.
>> THE ONLY STUDY THEY
DIDN'T PAY FOR SHOULD THERE
BE EXACTLY ZERO NEW JOBS NET
THAT IT WOULD KILL AS MANY
AS IT WOULD CREATE AND IT
WOULD DO SO BY RAISING THE
PRICE OF GASOLINE ACROSS THE
MIDWEST.
>> Stephen: THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.
YOU GET OIL FROM THE GROUND,
SHIP IT ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES.
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GOING TO
BE JOBS OF DIGGING THE HOLE
TO PUT THE PIPE IN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: CONSTRUCTION
JOBS WITHIN THE POINT OF A
PIPELINE IS ONCE YOU HAVE
GOT IT NO ONE EVER HAS TO
WORK THERE AGAIN.
THE TRANS-CANADA HEAD SAID
LAST WEEK THAT THERE MIGHT
BE A FEW HUNDRED PERMANENT
JOBS THAT WOULD BE CREATED
FROM THIS PIPELINE.
THE REAL JOBS COME WHEN WE
GETS OFF BIG OIL AND DECIDE
TO-- .
>> Stephen: BA, BA, HOLD ON
A SECOND, LET'S STICK WITH
THE OIL FOR A SECOND.
LET'S STICK WITH WHAT WE
KNOW WORKS.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH RUNG A
PIPELINE ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES?
>> THE PIPELINE COMES FROM
THIS TAR SANDS DEPOSIT IN
ALBERTA.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, WHICH BY
THE WAY YOU SAID THIS AREA
UP THERE, YOU SAID SECOND
LARGEST POOL OF OIL ON EARTH
AFTER SAUDI ARABIA.
THAT'S AN ARGUMENT AGAINST
IT?
>> WHEN WE FOUND-- .
>> Stephen: THAT GIVES ME A
JOB BONER TO HEAR THAT.
>> WHEN WE FOUND SAUDI
ARABIA WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
GLOBAL WARMING.
SO IT MADE SENSE TO GO
PLUMMET AND GET WHAT WE
COULD.
NOW THAT WE KNOW ABOUT
CLIMATE CHANGE, NOW THAT
WE'VE ALREADY RAISED THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH A
DEGREE LARGELY BY BURN NAG
SAUDI OIL WE WOULD BE CRAZY
TO FIND ITS SECOND SAUDI
ARABIA AND DO THE SAME
THING.
JIM HANSON AT NASA OR
FOREMOST CLIMATOLOGIST SAID
TAB HEAVILY -- TAP HEAVLY
INTO THAT TAR SAND DEPOSIT
AND IT'S AND I QUOTE
ESSENTIALLY GAME OVER FOR
THE CLIMATE.
>> Stephen: GAME OVER FOR
THE CLIMATE?
>> THERE WILL STILL BE A
CLIMATE.
WE'LL JUST CHANGE WHAT IT'S
MADE OF.
IT WILL BE THERE, AS A
MATTER OF FACT MATTER OF
FACT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE
IT MORE.
WE'LL BE MORE AWARE OF THE
CLIMATE.
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE GLASS
HALF EMPTY.
I'M SAYING IT'S HALF FULL OF
CARBON.
>> IT WILL BE-- AND IT WILL
BE HALF FULL OF WATER
BECAUSE WE'LL SEE THE
FLOODING THAT WE'VE SEEN
AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING
IN MY HOME STATE OF VERMONT
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
ABSOLUTELY RECORD OFF THE
CHARTS.
JUST INCREASING MORE AND
MORE AND MORE ALL THE TIME.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU FROM
VERMONT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DID YOU RIDE
YOUR BICYCLE DOWN HERE,
DRIVE OX CART, HOW DID YOU
GET DOWN HERE, OR DOW HAVE A
VEHICLE THAT ONES ON
HYPOCRISY, HOW DID YOU GET
DOWN HERE.
>> THERE IS TO DOUBT THAT,
YOU KNOW, I'M A HYPOCRITE.
I'VE SPENT THE LAST FOUR
YEARS ON THE MOVE AROUND THE
PLANET, BUILDING THIS BIG
GLOBAL CLIMATE MOVEMENT AND
SPEWING CARBON BEHIND ME AS
I WENT.
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT, I CAN'T MAKE UP FOR AS
MUCH AS I HAVE PUT OUT.
I HOPE THAT THIS MOVEMENT
THAT WE'RE BUILDING AND THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING
TO GO TO JAIL AND TO SIT IN
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND
DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS
MAYBE MAKING ENOUGH
DIFFERENCE TO MAKE UP FOR
THAT KIND OF CARBON.
>> Stephen: CAN I SELL YOU
ON THE OIL SANDS FOR A
SECOND HERE.
THEY'RE GETTING THE OIL OUT
OF THE OIL SANDS, OKAY.
ON THE UPSIDE, DOESN'T THAT
LEAVE US NICE CLEAN SAND
WHEN WE'RE DONE, WHICH
ALBERTA WILL NEED FOR ITS
BEACHES WHEN IT IS
WATERFRONT PROPERTY IN 50
YEARS.
(APPLAUSE)
THINK ABOUT IT.
BILL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
