(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, IT'S OFFICIALLY FALL,
WHICH MEANS WE ARE IN THEHOMESTRETCH TO THE 2014 MID TERM
ELECTIONS, AND I AM BURSTINGWITH MID-THUSIASM.
(LAUGHTER)IN JUST 62 DAYS, AMERICANS
NATIONWIDE WILL WAKE UP AND SAY,"DAMMIT.
I FORGOT TO VOTE YESTERDAY ."
(LAUGHTER)SO TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE THE
"LAUNCH" OF OUR MIDTERM COVERAGEBY BRINGING OUT THE U.S.S.
DEMOCRACY 2014 AND CHRISTENINGHER WITH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THOUGH AMERICA BE ROCKED BY
TROUBLED WATERS, SHE IS YETSTURDY AND PROUD.
LONG MAY SHE SAIL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(CHANTING "U.S.A. " )
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(CHANTING "U.S.A. " )
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
IT'S TIME FOR "THE COLBERTREPORT" MID-TERM ROUNDUP!
>> YEE-HAW!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: AS ALWAYS, A
HEARTY THANKS TO MYGOOD FRIEND STEVE CARELL FOR
LETTING US REUSE THAT FOOTAGEWITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR
CONSENT.
FIRST UP, FOLKS, THIS IS THEMOST IMPORTANT MID-TERM IN
MID-MEMORY, AND NOT JUST BECAUSEI CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST ONE.
AND YOU CAN TELL THE DEMOCRATSARE RUNNING SCARED BECAUSE
THEY'VE BEGUN ACTIVATING THEIRBASE.
THE LADY VOTERS.
JUST LOOK AT COSMO, WHICHANNOUNCED THEY WILL BE COVERING
THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS WITH "ANEW EFFORT THAT WILL INCLUDE
CANDIDATE ENDORSEMENTS" IN ANATTEMPT "TO GET READERS TO THE
POLLS AND BE PART OF" THE PARTYOF THE YEAR ."
I JUST HOPE COSMO'S ELECTIONADVICE IS JUST AS MISGUIDED AS
THEIR SEX ADVICE -- ENTER THEBOOTH, WRAP ONE LEG BEHIND YOUR
HEAD, RUB SOME HOT SAUCE ON THELEVER AND THEN...
(WHISTLE)PINKY UP HIS BUTT.
(CHEERING)NOW, THIS IS CLEARLY GOING TO
INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT, SO I'VEGOT SOME COSMO ADVICE OF MY OWN.
HELLO, LADIES.
I KNOW YOU ARE BEING ENCOURAGEDTO BECOME POLITICALLY ENGAGED,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU, GIRLFRIEND,THOSE CURTAINS DON'T LOOK GOOD
ON ANYONE.
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE WEARING ABOOTH MUUMUU.
PLUS, ALL ANYONE'S GONNA BEDOING IS LOOKING AT YOUR CALVES.
WHAT IF YOU HAVE CANKLES? AND IFYOU DON'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU HAVE CANKLES, YOUHAVE CANKLES
(CHEERING)DON'T VOTE.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE FIRSTRACE YOU SHOULD NOT VOTE IN --
THE HOUSE RACE IN GEORGIA'STENTH DISTRICT, WHERE RIGHT-WING
PASTOR AND RADIO HOST JODY HICEHAS ALL BUT GUARANTEED A WIN BY
BUILDING A DIVERSE COALITION OFPEOPLE HE DOESN'T WANT IN HIS
COALITION.
SO FAR, HE'S "COMPARED BEING GAYTO ALCOHOLISM, DRUG ADDICTION,
TENDENCIES TO LIE AND TO BEVIOLENT," HE HAS SAID A WOMAN
CAN ENTER POLITICS AS LONG ASSHE'S "WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF
HER HUSBAND," AND SAID MUSLIMSDON'T DESERVE FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHTS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)I AGREE.
MUSLIMS DO NOT DESERVE FREEDOMOF SPEECH.
THEY WOULD JUST USE IT TO OFFENDWOMEN AND GAY PEOPLE, AND HICE
ALREADY HAS THAT COVERED.
AND JODY HICE KNOWS A THING ORTWO ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION, AND
HE ISN'T AFRAID TO TELL YOUABOUT IT WHILE HOLDING A SCROLL
IN A FOYER.
>> WHEN OUR FOUNDERS CONVENED ATTHE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN
PHILADELPHIA IN 1787, THEYCRAFTED, I BELIEVE WITH GOD'S
HELP, THE MOST BRILLIANTGOVERNING DOCUMENT IN THE
HISTORY OF HUMANITY ."
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE FOUNDERS GOT THEIR IDEASDIRECTLY FROM GOD.
(LAUGHTER)I BELIEVE IT WAS YAWHEH WHO
WROTE THOMAS JEFFERSON'S FAMOUSLINE, "I LOVES ME SOME BROWN
SUGAR!"(CHEERING)
BUT NOW HICE IS UNDER ATTACK BYTHE BUZZ-KILLS AT BUZZ-FEED WHO
HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THEINSPIRATIONAL QUOTES FROM
FOUNDING FATHERS ON HISFACEBOOK PAGE" ARE FAKE."
FOR EXAMPLE, HICE'S PAGE SAYSJEFFERSON WROTE, "THAT
GOVERNMENT IS BEST WHICH GOVERNSTHE LEAST BECAUSE ITS PEOPLE
DISCIPLINE THEMSELVES," EVENTHOUGH IT WAS ACTUALLY HENRY
DAVID THOREAU, WHO LIVED ALONEAT WALDEN POND, SO I'M SURE HE
ENGAGED IN FURIOUS"SELF-DISCIPLINE."
AND HICE ALSO ATTRIBUTED THEINSPIRATIONAL QUOTE "IF YOUR
ACTIONS INSPIRE OTHERS TO DREAMMORE, LEARN MORE, DO MORE, AND
BECOME MORE, YOU ARE A LEADER"TO JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, ALTHOUGH
IT'S ACTUALLY FROM DOLLY PARTON.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S EASY TO MISTAKE THOSE TWO,
ESPECIALLY AFTER JOHN QUINCYADAMS GOT THOSE IMPLANTS.
(LAUGHTER)HICE HAS USED SO MANY
MISATTRIBUTIONS THAT BUZZFEEDFOUND EIGHT EXAMPLES OF THE
FRAUDULENT QUOTES BEFORE THEY"STOPPED LOOKING."
(LAUGHTER)WOW.
THERE'S YOUR HEADLINE --BUZZFEED STOPPED LOOKING FOR
EXAMPLES OF SOMETHING?
THAT RAISES A TROUBLINGQUESTION -- COULD THERE ALSO BE
MORE THAN "13 POTATOES THAT LOOKLIKE CHANNING TATUM?"
(LAUGHTER)NATION, I "LIKE" WHAT HICE IS
DOING ON FACEBOOK, AND NOTJUST BECAUSE "LIKING" IS THE
ONLY OPTION ON FACEBOOK.
THOSE QUOTES MAY NOT HAVE COMEFROM OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, BUT
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
IT'S LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON SAIDAT VALLEY FORGE,
"CLOSE ENOUGH FOR JAZZ.
VOTE HICE 2014 ."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
