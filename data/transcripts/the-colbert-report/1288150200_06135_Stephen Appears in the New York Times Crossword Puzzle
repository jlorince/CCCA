NATION, YOU KNOW, NATION, THERE
ARE SO, SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES
OF AMERICANS COME TOGETHER TO
MAKE THIS NATION GREAT.
SOME PEOPLE ARE DOCTORS.
SOME PEOPLE ARE LAWYERS.
SOME PEOPLE ARE PUNDITS.
SOME PEOPLE ARE DIESEL
TECHNICIANS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND THOSE PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE
ARE THE ONES THAT KEEP THIS
NATION CHUGGING ALONG.
I SALUTE YOU.
AS YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALSO VERY
NEEDY PEOPLE.
THEY ARE EASILY HURT.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU TAKE THE BAD WITH THE GOOD.
AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE ARE JUST
FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM MY AND THAT
OTHER I GUY'S RALLY ON THE
NATIONAL MALL IN WASHINGTON,
D.C.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
AND IF YOU HAVE NOT BOOKED YOUR
PLANE TICKET YET, GET WALKING
AND BRING A TENT BECAUSE THE
HOTELS ARE BOOKED AND,
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEMOCRATS'
OFFICES WON'T BE VACANT UNTIL
NEXT WEEK.
EVERYONE, EVERYONE IS GETTING
EXCITED ABOUT THE RALLY,
INCLUDING THE MAINSTREAM PRESS.
WE ARE HEAVILY FEATURED IN
TODAY'S "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
RIGHT HERE.
IT'S NOT THE FRONT PAGE OR THE
BUSINESS PAGES AND NOT EVEN IN
PAUL KRUGMAN'S KIDZ KORNER WHICH
TODAY IS "COLOR IN THIS PICTURE
OF JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES AGAIN."
NO, I'M IN THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS
LOCATION, PAGE C-4 IN THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" CROSS WORD PUZZLE,
RIGHT THERE, DADD-O.
FOLKS, THIS IS AMAZING.
EVERY DAY I FILL IN THE "TIMES"
CROSSWORD WITH STUFF ABOUT ME...
( LAUGHTER )
AND THIS TIME, THIS TIME IT
ACTUALLY WORKS.
SEE, YOU'VE GOT THAT.
SEE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, ONE,
LIKE ONE RIGHT THERE, ONE AND 17
ACROSS IS "RALLY TO RESTORE
SANITY."
AND 54, SEE 54 AND 65 ARE "MARCH
TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE."
DOWN HERE.
AND HERE'S MY NAME RIGHT THERE.
AND THERE'S EVEN SOME GOOD
ADVICE FOR SATURDAY RIGHT HERE,
"AVOID RIOT."
( LAUGHTER )
I JUST WANT TO SAY TO "NEW YORK
TIMES" CROSSWORD EDITOR WILL
SHORTZ, WHERE'S MY CUT, WILL?
YOU'RE SELLING PUZZLES USING MY
RALLY, AND DADDY WANTS A LITTLE
TASTE OF THAT SWEET, SWEET
CROSSWORD CASH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY?
DON'T MAKE ME PUT MY RINGS ON.
AND UNTIL I SEIZE IT, WILL, TWO
CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME.
THAT IS WHY, WILL SHORTZ, I HAVE
STARTED SELLING MY NEW LEGAL
SERVICES GARMENT -- WILL SHORTS.
IT'S A PAIR OF ALL-COTTON BOXERS
WITH LAST WILL AND TESTMENT
PRINTED RIGHT ON IT.
OKAY.
YOU JUST FILL IN THE BLANK.
NOW IF YOU GET HIT BY A CAR, NOT
ONLY WILL YOU HAVE ON CLEAN
UNDERWEAR, BUT EVERYONE WILL
KNOW WHO WILL INHERIT YOUR "LORD
OF THE RINGS" PINBALL MACHINE.
ONE OTHER THING, WILL
