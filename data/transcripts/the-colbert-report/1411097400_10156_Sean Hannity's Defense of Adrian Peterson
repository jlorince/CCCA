(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, I LOVE THE N.F.L.
IT'S AMERICA'S TOP FORUM FORDISCUSSING ISSUES OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE.
AND I UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYEESALSO GET TOGETHER AND PLAY BALL
ON THE WEEKENDS.
(LAUGHTER)AND THE BIGGEST BUT NOT THE
LATEST SAD NEWS OUT OF THEN.F.L. IS THE ARREST OF
MINNESOTA VIKINGS RUNNING BACKADRIAN PETERSON ON CHARGES OF
CHILD ABUSE.
AFTER HE "SPANKED HIS SON SOHARD WITH A SWITCH THE BOY
SUFFERED INJURIES ALL OVER HISBODY."
REALLY MAKES YOU NOSTALGIC FORTHE DAYS WHEN PLAYERS WERE
ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTING THEMSELVESTHROUGH THEIR SWEAT PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)PETERSON WAS SUSPENDED
INDEFINITELY THIS WEEK AND FOXNEWS' SENIOR NERF FOOTBALL
CHUCKER, SEAN HANNITY, WAS NOTPLEASED.
(LAUGHTER)>> I GOT HIT WITH A STRAP, BAM,
BAM, BAM -- AND I HAVE NEVERBEEN TO SHRINK -- BY MY FATHER.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DESERVEDIT.
I THINK HE WENT TOO FAR, BUT IDON'T WANT TO SEE THIS GUY GET A
FELONY.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS GUYLOSE HIS JOB.
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEENSPANKING AND CHILD ABUSE,
SPANKING AND CORPORALPUNISHMENT.
BUT WE GREW UP IN A TIME -->> I GOT IT LIKE THIS -- AGH,
AGH, AGH!
>> STEPHEN: PUMPKIN PATCH!
PUMPKIN PATCH!
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S THE SAFE WORD SEAN AND IAGREED ON.
BUT HANNITY IS RIGHT ON THISONE.
ADRIAN PETERSON WENT TOO FAR,BUT THE MAN DESERVES A SECOND
CHANCE.
AFTER ALL, SEAN'S DAD WHIPPEDHIM WITH A BELT, AND HE NEVER
NEEDED TO GO TO APSYCHOTHERAPIST!
HE JUST HAS TO HAVE THEM ON HISSHOW THREE TIMES A WEEK.
(LAUGHTER)AND SEAN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN JUST
HOW UNAFFECTED HE WAS BY HISCHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE HE CAN'T
STOP MENTIONING.
>> SO MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE BEENARRESTED BASED ON TODAY'S
STANDARDS?
>> MAYBE, YES.
>> THAT IS NUTS.
I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS NOTMENTALLY BRUISED BECAUSE MY
FATHER HIT ME WITH A BELT.
>> STEPHEN: NO, HE WASPHYSICALLY BRUISED.
MENTALLY, HE GREW UP TO BE APSYCHOLOGICALLY HEALTHY ADULT
WHO CLEAVES DESPERATELY TOSTRONG AUTHORITY FIGURES, LASHES
OUT AT PERCEIVED WEAKNESS ANDTAKES HIS BELT OFF ON LIVE TV.
(LAUGHTER)STILL, IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR
HANNITY'S GREAT AMERICAN PANELTO TURN INTO A GREAT AMERICAN
INTERVENTION.
>> WE'RE GOING TO ARRESTEVERYBODY THAT HAS EVER HIT
THEIR KIDS?
>> BUT IT'S A CHANGING TIME.
>> CHANGING TIME.
>> DID YOUR DAD STICK LEAVES INYOUR MOUTH LIKE ADRIAN
PETERSON -->> MY DAD PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE
WHEN I TALKED BACK TO HIM ONCE,AND I DESERVED IT.
>> STEPHEN: SEE?
ALL HANNITY IS SAYING IS THATSOME CHILDREN DESERVE TO BE
PUNCHED IN THE FACE.
ALTHOUGH IT IS SAD TO SEE THAT,SO MANY YEARS LATER, THE
SWELLING STILL HASN'T GONE DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS, OUR COUNTRY'S GONE
SOFT.
NOT LIKE IN MY DAY.
WHEN I WAS A KID AND I DIDN'TEAT MY PEAS, MY MOM WOULD BASH
ME OVER THE HEAD WITH A FOLDINGCHAIR.
(LAUGHTER)WHEN I STAYED OUT PAST DARK, I
COULD EXPECT TO SEE MY DADWAITING IN THE KITCHEN WITH A
BURLAP SACK AND A RABID BADGER.
(LAUGHTER)AND I WON'T SOON FORGET THE TIME
PEE-POP GOT ME IN A FULL NELSON,AND THEN TAGGED IN MY GRANDMA,
WHO CAME IN OFF THE TOP ROPEWITH AN ELBOW DROP THAT MADE ME
THINK TWICE ABOUT NOT WEARING MYRETAINER.
(LAUGHTER)AND I DESERVED IT EVERY TIME.
NOT BECAUSE I MADE AN INNOCENTCHILDHOOD MISTAKE, BUT BECAUSE I
AM A BAD, BAD PERSON.
I AM A FAILURE!
DISAPPOINTING EVERYONE I LOVE,EVEN YOU, TOOTS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)EVEN YOU!
I'M SO SORRY YOU HATE ME BECAUSEI CAN'T BE LOVED!
(CRYING)OH, GOD
I'M EMBARRASSING MYSELF ONNATIONAL TELEVISION.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY I'LL LEARN.
THIS WILL TEACH YOU TO LOSECONTROL ON TELEVISION!
NEVER LET THEM SEE WHO YOUREALLY ARE!
(LAUGHTER)ANYWAY, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,
SEAN.
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE GROUP ONWEDNESDAY!
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
