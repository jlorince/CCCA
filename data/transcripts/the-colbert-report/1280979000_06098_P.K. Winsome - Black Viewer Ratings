[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, WHEN I WANT THE LATEST
NEWS ON FOX NEWS, I TURN TO FOX
NEWS.
>> FOX DOMINATES THE RATINGS.
>> Stephen: AND LOOK AT WHAT
TALKING ABOUT THEIR RATINGS HAS
DONE FOR THEIR RATINGS.
>> THE RATINGS HAVE BEEN HUGE.
>> DAYTIME, PRIME TIME, ANY
TIME, MORE VIEWERS TUNE INTO FOX
THAN THE COMPETITION COMBINED.
>> WE WERE NUMBER ONE IN ENTIRE
CABLE ALL WEEK.
>> THE NUMBER-ONE CABLE NEWS
SHOW FOR NINE YEARS.
>> MSNBC AND CNN ON WEDNESDAY
RECEIVED TERRIBLE RATINGS WHILE
FOX NEWS DOMINATED, AS USUAL.
>> Stephen: THEY TOUT THEIR
RATINGS SO MUCH, I'M SURPRISED
THEY DON'T SLAP A BLONDE WIG ON
THEM AND GIVE THEM THEIR OWN
SHOW.
SO I WAS SURPRISED THAT FOX
DIDN'T COVER THE RECENT STORY
THAT A FULL 1.38% OF THEIR
AUDIENCE IS BLACK.
THAT'S 29,000 VIEWERS.
PERSONALLY, I HAD NO IDEA SO
MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE
TERRIFIED OF BARACK OBAMA.
NOW, I'VE HAD MY RESEARCH TEAM,
BEST IN THE BIZ, BREAK DOWN
THOSE NUMBERS.
OF THOSE 29,000 BLACK VIEWERS,
IT APPEARS 45% ARE TRAPPED IN
THE WAITING ROOM OF A JIFFY
LUBE.
7% ARE WHITE PEOPLE WHO JUST
ENJOY WATCHING FOX NEWS IN BLACK
FACE.
25% SAID GLEN GLENN BECK'S NAME
THREE TIMES IN THE MIRROR AND
HIS SHOW APPEARED, AND THE
REMAINING 23% IS JUAN WILLIAMS.
SO ONCE AGAIN FOX IS DOMINATING.
IN FACT, THE ONLY WAY THESE
SKY-HIGH NUMBERS AREN'T
IMPRESSIVE IS IF YOU COMPARE
THEM TO SOMETHING.
LIKE THE FACT THAT AFRICAN
AMERICANS MAKE UP 13% OF THE
U.S. POPULATION OR THAT THE
AUDIENCES OF CNN AND MSNBC ARE
BOTH AROUND 20% BLACK.
COINCIDENTALLY, SO IS SOLEDAD
O'BRIEN.
[LAUGHTER]
THE PROBLEM, IS FOLKS, WITH SO
LITTLE DIVERSITY IN THEIR
AUDIENCE, PEOPLE JUST ASSUME THE
WORST ABOUT FOX NEWS.
FOR INSTANCE, JUST LAST NIGHT
GRETA VAN SUSTERN MADE AN
INNOCENT MISTAKE.
YOU SEE, SHE AND A GUEST WERE
DISCUSSING BLACK CONGRESSWOMAN
MAXINE WATERS BUT SHOWED VIDEO
OF SHIRLEY SHERROD.
AND TODAY GRETTA APOLOGIZED.
BUT I SAY, IT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO ANYONE WHOSE
PRODUCERS CAN'T TELL BLACK
PEOPLE APART.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, AND BILL O'REILLY, MY HERO,
HAS BEEN SO VICTIMIZED BY HIS
LACK OF BLACK VIEWERS THAT THEY
HAVE FORCED HIM TO TAKE DRASTIC
ACTION.
>> I AND MANY OTHER WHITE
JOURNALISTS NOW DON'T DO NEARLY
AS MANY REPORTS ON AFRICAN
AMERICANS OR THEIR PROBLEMS
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE PUT
IN A SITUATION WHERE OUR OPINION
IS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, RAMMED
DOWN OUR THROAT.
SO UNLESS IT'S A BIG THING, IF
IT'S AN OPTIONAL THING WHERE I
USED TO DO IT, I'M NOT DOING IT
ANYMORE.
>> Stephen: WAY TO GO NO BLACK
PEOPLE WATCHING.
ANOTHER VOICE OF THE CIVIL
RIGHTS MOVEMENT SILENCED.
SO WHAT CAN FOX DO TO CATCH UP
IN THIS KEY DEMOGRAPHIC?
HERE TO HELP, PLEASE WELCOME
BLACK REPUBLICAN,
BLACK-TREPRENEUR AND MY FRIEND
P.K. WINSON.
P.K., MY MAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, BUDDY, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE
YOU.
>> LIKEWISE, MY FRIEND.
>> Stephen: NOW, P.K., YOU'RE
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, AND YOU
WATCH TV.
>> FREQUENTLY AT THE SAME TIME.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO AM I RIGHT THAT THIS IS A
PROBLEM FOR FOX NEWS?
>> NOT JUST FOR FOX NEWS.
YOU, TOO, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: WATCHOO TALKING
'BOUT, P.K.?
>> ALL RIGHT.
NOW BRACE YOURSELF, ACCORDING TO
NIELSEN THE COLBERT AUDIENCE IS
ONLY 5% AFRICAN AMERICAN.
>> Stephen: 5%?
ARE YOU SURE?
I JUST HAD ON "VAMPIRE WEEKEND"
AND DEVO.
>> WHAT CAN I SAY, WE'RE A
FICKLE PEOPLEMENT
>> Stephen: OKAY, P.K., WHAT
CAN I DO TO INCREASE BLACK
VIEWERSHIP?
>> WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED
BECAUSE WE AGREED THAT YOU
WOULD, STEPHEN.
[LAUGHTER]
I OWN AN ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE,
P.K. WINSOME'S TRANSISTOR TOWN.
AND FOR A MODEST FEE, I WILL
TUNE ALL THE TVS IN MY STORE TO
YOUR SHOW AND PERSONALLY STAND
IN FRONT OF THEM AND BE BLACK.
RIGHT THERE YOU HAVE 6,000 MORE
VIEWERS.
>> STEPHEN: THAT IS A GREAT
IDEA.
>> HERE IS ANOTHER GREAT IDEA.
MAKE YOUR SHOW SOUND MORE
APPEALING TO AN URBAN AUDIENCE.
INSTEAD OF "THE COLBERT REPORT,"
HOW ABOUT, "TYLER PERRY'S
COLBERT REPORT BASED ON THE
NOVEL "PUSH" BY SAPPHIRE"?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WOULD THAT WORK?
>> YES, STEPHEN, YOU CAN ASK ANY
WHITE TV EXECUTIVE, BLACK PEOPLE
LIKE WATCHING OTHER BLACK
PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO
INTRODUCE MY NEW PAST DIVERSITY
ENHANCEMENT SERVICE, P.K., YOU
BUGGIN', WHERE ON ANY SHOW WITH
NO BLACK PEOPLE I REPLACE THE
NETWORK BUG IN THE CORNER OF THE
SCREEN WITH AN IMAGE OF MYSELF
APPEARING TO BE INTERESTED IN
THE SHOW.
IT INSTANTLY MAKES ANY SHOW SEEM
LIKE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO
BLACK PEOPLE.
CHECK IT OUT.
>> THIS PRESIDENT I THINK HAS
EXPOSED HIMSELF AS A GUY OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHO HAS
A DEEP-SEATED HATRED FOR WHITE
PEOPLE.
"FOOD FOR THOUGHT."
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT SWEEPS
WEEK WHEN I NEED THE SPECIAL
BUMP.
>> STEPHEN, IF YOU CAN'T ATTRACT
NEW BLACK VIEWERS, YOU CAN
PURCHASE NEW BLACK VIEWERS
THANKS TO P.K. WINSOME'S
INFLATABLE RATINGS BOOSTER,
NIELSEN MANDELA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
WHO IS THIS BLACK GUY?
SECURITY.
>> NO, NO.
IT'S COOL, MAN.
HE'S WITH ME.
>> Stephen: ALL YOU DO...
[LAUGHTER]
>> HE DOESN'T STAY DOWN,
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: NICE.
THERE YOU GO.
>> NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
HAVE YOUR WHITE VIEWERS BUY A
NIELSEN MANDELA AND PLACE HIM ON
THE COUCH NEXT TO THEM AND
PRESTO, HALF YOUR AUDIENCE IS
BLACK.
PLUS IF YOU PUT HIM IN YOUR
PASSENGER SEAT, YOU CAN DRIVE IN
THE CARPOOL LANE.
QUICK SIDE NOTE: YOU WILL GET
PULLED OVER.
>> Stephen: BUT P.K., I DON'T
WANT TO BUY A BLACK AUDIENCE.
I WANT THEM TO BE REAL FANS LIKE
YOU.
WHY DO YOU WATCH MY SHOW?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE ALL
THE THINGS THAT YOU DO ON IT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NICE.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING.
>> COME ON, YOU KNOW, I LIKE
YOUR TALKING, OH, AND I LIKE
WYATT CENAC AND LARRY WILMOR.
THOSE GUYS ARE AMAZING.
>> Stephen: YEAH, THEY ARE,
THEY ARE.
THAT'S THE THE DAILY SHOW.
>> OH, THEY ARE?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> WELL, THEN I LIKE YOUR
BOOKSHELVES, THEY'RE COOL.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T WATCH MY
SHOW, DO YOU?
>> NO, I DO WHEN I'M ON.
AND THIS GUY IS A HUGE FAN.
LOOK HOW H
