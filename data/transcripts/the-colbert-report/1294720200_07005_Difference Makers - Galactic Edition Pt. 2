FOLKS, HOPEFULLY I WAS NOT
ABDUCTED DURING THE COMMERCIAL
BREAK AND REPLACED WITH AN
IDENTICAL ALIEN POD PERSON.
I GUESS I'LL NEVER KNOW.
NOW, FOR THE CONCLUSION OF
TONIGHT'S DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE
MAKERS.
PREVIOUSLY ON "DIFFERENCE
MAKERS: GALACTIC EDITION," WE
MET DARRYL SIMS, ALIEN HUNTER.
>> I AM KNOWN AS THE ALIEN
HUNTER.
♪ ALIEN HUNTER
MAKING A DIFFERENCE ♪♪
>> Stephen: DARRYL WARNED THAT
OUR ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT
EXTRATERRESTRIALS WILL NOT END
WELL FOR HUMANS AT ALL.
>> THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL
FOR HUMANS AT ALL.
>> Stephen: BUT SOME PEOPLE
DON'T CARE ABOUT HUMANITY, LIKE
JOE DAVIS, A RESEARCH AFFILIATE
AT BOTH M.I.T. AND HARVARD WHO
HAS BEEN BROADCASTING AMERICA'S
LOCATION INTO SPACE FOR ALMOST
30 YEARS.
AND WHY?
>> WELL, UH...
>> Stephen: FAIR ENOUGH.
SO TELL US ABOUT ONE OF YOUR
MESSAGES.
>> EXCUSE ME.
>> Stephen:, NO EXCUSE ME.
I'M INTRIGUED.
WHAT IS POETICA VAGINAL.
>> IT WAS A PROJECT TO TRANSMIT
VAGINAL CONTRACTION INTO SPACE
TO COMMUNICATE.
>> Stephen: I MUST ADMIT, I'M
LESS INTRIGUED.
HOW DID YOU DO THIS?
>> INSIDE THERE'S A TINY
PRESSURE POINT THAT'S EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU PUT THIS
THING, WHICH I PRAY IS MORE
SANITARY THAN IT LOOKS, UP WHERE
IT DON'T SHINE, AND RECORDED THE
SOUND OF CONTRACTIONS.
THAT PART MAKES SENSE, BUT WHY
ON EARTH WOULD YOU EVER SEND
THAT VALUABLE INFORMATION INTO
SPACE?
NOW THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE
ARE AND THAT WE HAVE HAVE VAGINAS.
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH DARRYL CAN
DO TO PROTECT US.
>> THIS IS LIKE OPENING
PANDORA'S BOX.
IF YOU OPEN IT, YOU'LL NEVER
CLOSE IT AGAIN.
>> WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
>> Stephen: DARRYL, TELL THEM
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
>> IT GOES UP MY NASAL PASSAGE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WE UNDERSTAND THEY PROBED YOUR
NASAL PASSAGE.
WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN?
>> JAMMED VERY PAINFULLY.
>> GOT IT.
WHAT ELSE?
>> THIS NO, SIR INDUSTRIAL.
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND IT,
YOUR NOSE.
ANY OTHER POSSIBLE PERIL.
THINK.
>> I'M GOING TO PUT MY
INTELLIGENCE HAT ON NOW.
>> Stephen: THAT SEEMS LIKE A
GOOD IDEA.
THE ALIEN PRESENCE HAS ACTUALLY
ENCOUNTERED SOME OF OUR NUCLEAR
BASES.
THIS IS A MATTER OF RECORD.
YOU CAN GO AND FIND THE
INFORMATION.
>> Stephen: REMEMBER, THIS
ISN'T JUST DARRYL TALKING, THIS
IS THE INTERNET.
BACK THE DARRYL.
>> THE ALIEN PRESENCE CAME OVER
IN THE U.F.ONAND ACTIVATED THE
NUCLEAR MISSILES IN RUSSIA AND
HERE.
AND IF WE HAD NOT TAKEN THE
ACTIONS WE DID AND STOPPED THE
COUNTDOWN, THE ALIENS COULD HAVE
STARTED A NUCLEAR WAR.
>> Stephen: AND DARRYL HAS
THIS ON EXTREMELY GOOD
INFORMATION.
>> I HAVE THIS ON EXTREMELY GOOD
INFORMATION.
STOOP STEEP OKAY.
THAT CHECKS OUT.
BUT GUESS WHO REFUSES TO BE
CONVINCED?
>> I WOULD INSIST ON REAL
EVIDENCE, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE.
>> Stephen: EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE?
OH, IF IT'S PROOF YOU WANT,
DARRYL GOT PLENTY.
>> YOU WANT PROOF?
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME PROOF.
( LAUGHTER )
( LAUGHTER )
>> WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS AN
OBJECT THAT WAS RETRIEVED FROM
AN INDIVIDUAL, AN ABDUCT TEE,
THAT AGAIN APPEARS TO BE
METEORIC IN ORIGIN.
>> WELL, MR. DAVIS, CARE TO
APOLOGIZE NOW?
>> I WON'T TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE.
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK PLEASE.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WHY DON'T
YOU THINK ABOUT HOW YOU
ENDANGERED HUMANITY BY CALLING
DOWN THE ALIENS THAT WE ALL KNOW
ARE OUT THERE.
>> IF THEY'RE THERE, I CAN'T SEE
THEM.
>> Stephen: FORTUNATELY THERE
IS ONE DIFFERENCE MAKER WHO CAN
SEE THEM.
>> I'M THE ALIEN HUNTER.
I HUNT ALIENS.

WE MAY NEVER KNOW IF WE'RE ALONE
IN THE UNIVERSE, BUT WE DO KNOW
