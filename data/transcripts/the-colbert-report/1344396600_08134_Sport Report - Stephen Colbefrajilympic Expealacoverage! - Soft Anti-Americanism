( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT." (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") EVERYDAY!
EVERYDAY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
FOLKS, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE CALENDAR SAYS, EVERYDAY IS FOURTH OF JULY IN THIS STUDIO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, WE'RE IN WEEK TWO OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF ALL OF THE SPORT.
(LAUGHTER) WHETHER IT'S THROW-A-STICK, FREE STYLE NECK VEIN OR THE MAN PANTY FANCY FALL.
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE SCORE REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THE SCORE REPORT PRESENTS:.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I ENJOY NBC'S OLYMPIC COVERAGE,
ALL THEY HAVE IS FOOTAGE OF THE EVENTS AND INTERVIEWS WITH THE ATHLETES.
FOR THE REAL STORY, I ALWAYS TURN TO FOX NEWS.
(LAUGHTER) JUST THE OTHER DAY, AMERICA LIVE HOST AND FOX NEWS BLOND B-294 AL
SON CAM ROT A AND HER GUESTS BLEW THE LID OFF A GROWING OLYMPIC SCANDAL.
>> THERE'S A PROUD MOMENT AT THE OLYMPICS YESTERDAY WHEN 16-YEAR-OLD GABBY DOUGLAS WON A
GOLD MEDAL IN GYMNASTICS.
THE CROWD WENT WILD WITH CHEERS THOUGH WE'RE NOT HEARING THE CHANTS OF "U.S.A."
THAT WE'VE HEARD IN SOME OLYMPICS GONE BY AND SOME FOLKS HAVE NOTICED THAT AMERICAN
ATHLETES' UNIFORMS DON'T CARRY THE STARS AND STRIPES LOOK AS
MUCH AS THEY HAVE IN PAST YEARS.
GABBY HAD THAT GREAT MOMENT,
EVERYBODY WAS SO EXCITED AND SHE'S IN HOT PINK.
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH SHOWING PRIDE?
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THIS KIND OF SOFT ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING
THAT AMERICANS CAN'T SHOW OUR EXCEPTIONALISM.
>> Stephen: YEAH!
WHERE'S THE AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM?
THOSE CHEERING FANS AND THOSE ATHLETES WHO DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO REPRESENT AMERICA
STANDING ON A PODIUM C W THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEARTS FIGHTING BACK THE TEARS WHILE THE U.S.
FLAG ASCENDS TO THE RAFTERS AND OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE ARENA JUST DON'T
SEEM THAT INTO IT.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WOULD IT KILL YOU TO GIVE THAT FLAG PATCH A FLAG PIN?
(LAUGHTER) AND YOU, GABBY DOUGLAS,
AMERICA'S SWEETHEART, THE DEVIL'S MAGENTA?
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WORE PURPLE?
HITLER.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S TRUE, YOU DON'T SEE THAT
BECAUSE IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE MOST OF THE TIME.
I MEAN, WHERE IS THE PATRIOTISM?
SURE, AFTER THE RACE 400 METER GOLD MEDALIST SONIA RICHARD ROTH RAN AROUND WITH THE FLAG OVER
HER SHOULDERS BUT IF SHE REALLY LOVED AMERICA SHE WOULD HAVE CARRIED IT DURING THE RACE!
(LAUGHTER) AND, YES, BRONZE MEDALIST D.B.
TROTTER HAD RED, WHITE, AND BLUE GLITTER ON HER FACE, BUT THAT WASHES OFF.
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING PERMANENT LIKE A FACE TAT OF REAGAN'S FACE.
(LAUGHTER) IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS SOFT ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING ONE
ATHLETE'S PATRIOTISM WAS ROCK HARD.
>> U.S. ROWING MEDALIST HENRICK ROMMEL SEEN HERE SPORTING HIS GOLD AND TWO BRONZE.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THAT IS HOW YOU SALUTE THE FLAG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COOL THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE OTHER ROWERS?
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAYING AND YOU'RE AT HALF MAST!
I MEAN, WHO DIED?
OF COURSE, HUMBLE IN VICTORY RUM MEL TOOK TO THE RED DITS AND
WROTE "I SWEAR IT'S NOT ERECT, I DON'T KNOW HOW IT ENDED UP IN THAT POSITION."
(LAUGHTER) IT'S NOT HARD TO GUESS HOW IT ENDED UP IN THAT POSITION AFTER
SPENDING 15 YEARS IN A BOAT WITH
