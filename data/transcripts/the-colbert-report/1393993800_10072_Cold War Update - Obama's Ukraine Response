HIS HEAD HERE.

>> THIS IS THE ULTIMATE RESULTOF A FECKLESS FOREIGN POLICY
WHERE NOBODY BELIEVES INAMERICA'S STRENGTH ANYMORE.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'SA PERCEPTION OF AMERICAN
INDECISIVENESS AND WEAKNESS.
>> WE LOOK LIKE AN IMPOTENTVACILLATING COUNTRY.
>> EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT GOESON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND
THREATENS PUTIN OR ANYONE LIKEPUTIN, EVERYBODY'S EYES ROLL,
INCLUDING MINE.
WE HAVE A WEAK AND INDECISIVEPRESIDENT THAT INVITES
AGGRESSION.
>> THAT OLD LADY IS RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )OBAMA-- OBAMA NEEDS TO
IMMEDIATELY DO SOMETHING MANLY.
MAYBE A ONE-ARMED PUSH-UP ORCARVE A CANOE OR INVADE A
FOREIGN COUNTRY.
HOW ABOUT IRAQ?
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM!
( APPLAUSE )BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES IS GETTINGOUTPLAYED.
LOOK AT WHAT HE WORE SATURDAYDURING A TENSE 90-MINUTE PHONE
CALL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
NO TIE.

MEANWHILE ON THE OTHER END YOUKNOW PUTIN SHIRTLESS STROKING A
TIGER LOOKING INTO HIS INFINITYMIRROR.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
SO I SAY THE DISASTER, INSTEADOF PUTTING BOOTS ON THE GROUND
AND STARTING WORLD WAR III--LIKE WE ALL WANT-- BIG CHIEF
"LEADS FROM THE BEHIND" DOESWHAT HE ALWAYS DOES AND JUST
SENDS IN A DRONE.
>> I COME HERE TODAY AT THEINSTRUCTION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA
TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THEUNITED STATES OF AMERICA WOULD
PREFER TO SEE THIS DE-ESCALATED.
WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE THISMANAGED THROUGH THE STRUCTURES
OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS.

"PREFER."

REMINDS ME OF REAGAN AT THEBRANDENBERG GATE.
>> MR. GORBACHEV, WE PREFER YOUNOT HAVE A WALL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  I MISS THAT GOOD
MAN.
SO WHAT WILL THE PRESIDENT DO?
FOR THE ANSWER, LET'S GOSTRAIGHT TO THE LEADER OF THE
FREE WORLD.
>> NUMBER ONE, THERE WILL BE NOMILITARY BUDGET CUTS, OBAMA HAS
TO KNOW THAT NOW.
NUMBER TWO, THE KEYSTONEPIPELINE MUST BE APPROVED.
WHY?
BECAUSE RUSSIA IS BLACKMAILINGEUROPE OVER ENERGY.
>> Stephen:  BILL IS RIGHT,MILITARY FUNDING AND KEYSTONE.
OBAMA NEEDS TO PROVE HE'S ASTRONG LEADER BY GIVING
REPUBLICANS EVERYTHING THEY'VEASKED FOR.
( LAUGHTER )PLUS RUSSIA'S ANTIGAY LAWS COULD
DRIVE THEIR HOMOSEXUALS OVERHERE, SO TO KEEP THEM OUT WE
NEED A BORDER WALL WITH MEXICOBEFORE THE GAYS INVADE VIA
CANCUN, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'REA BEACH PEOPLE.
