>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMERCONGRESSMAN WHO NOW LEADS AN
ANTI-MARIJUANA LOBBYINGGROUP.
BET THEY GET A LOT MORE DONETHAN THE PRO MARIJUANA GROUP.
PLEASE WELCOME PATRICKKENNEDY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)MR. KENNEDY, THANKS FOR
COMING ON.
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THECV OUT. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY
KNOWS THE FAMILY NAME BUTYOU SERVED 16 YEARS IN THE
HOUSE IN RHODE ISLAND'SFIRST DISTRICT.
YOU WERE CO-AUTHOR AND LEADSPONSOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH
PARITY AND ADDICTIONEQUALITY ACT.
NOW LEADING PROJECT SAM WHATIS SAM.
>> I CAME TO THIS BECAUSE IWAS A SPONSOR OF THIS MENTAL
HEALTH BILL THAT SAID THEBRAIN WAS PART OF THE BODY.
THAT WAS A BIG PIECE OFLEGISLATION YOU JUST CITED
THAT I SPONSORED.
>> Stephen: IF THE BRAIN ISPART OF THE BODY THEN WHY DO
WOMEN WANT TO KNOW IF WEWANT THEM FOR THEIR BODY OR
THEIR BRAIN?
(LAUGHTER)CAN'T HAVE BOTH, CAN'T HAVE
IT BOTH WAYS.
ANYWAY-- GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.
>> SO JUST LIKE WOMEN AREDISCRIMINATED AGAINST
BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE A BABYTHEY ARE HIGHER COSTS, YOU
KNOW, WE WERE TRYING TO MAKESURE THAT YOU COULDN'T
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEBRAIN AND MENTAL ILLNESS
WHICH INSURANCE COMPANIESTRADITIONALLY DO.
THEY IMPOSE HIGHER COSTS ONYOU AS A CONSUMER IF YOU
HAVE A BRAIN ILLNESS.
BUT IF YOU HAVE DIABETES ORASTHMA OR CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE, THEY DON'T CHARGEYOU MORE OR DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST YOU MORE.
EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE AVERY COSTLY HEALTH PATIENT.
>> Stephen: BUT IF YOURBRAIN ILLNESS IS BAD ENOUGH,
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE BEINGDISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
(LAUGHTER)DOESN'T IT ALL COME OUT IN
THE WASH, THERE, PAT?
>> THAT'S TRUE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS WHYIT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO GET
THE BILL PASSED BECAUSEUNLIKE CANCER ADVOCATES,
THEY ALL SHOW UP WHEN YOUHAVE A CANCER BILL.
MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATESDON'T LIKE TO PUT THEIR HAND
UP AND SAY THEY HAVE AMENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE OF
THE  STIGMA AGAINST THEILLNESS.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE ANEW AXE TO GRIND HERE.
YOU'RE OPPOSED TO MARIJUANALEGALIZATION.
OKAY.
YOU'RE A YOUNG, POPULARDEMOCRAT.
WHY ARE YOU ADMIRAL BUZZSHACKLER ON THIS ONE.
I'M WITH YOU, AN I TELL YOUWHY IN A SECOND.
I AGREE WITH YOU AND I ALSODISAGREE WITH YOU FOR TWO
DIFFERENT REASONS.
BUT FIRST, MAKE YOUR CASE TOAMERICA RIGHT NOW, WHY
SHOULD WE NOT LEGALIZE POT.
BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENED INCOLORADO IS DOING IT,
WASHINGTON STATE IS DOING IT,20 STATES HAVE LEGAL MEDICAL
MARIJUANA.
>> WELL, I AM A GOOD LIBERALDEMOCRAT.
AND I DON'T LIKE BIGBUSINESS.
AND SO THIS IS THE BIGBUSINESS OF ADDICTION.
BECAUSE MARIJUANA IS NOWMOVED FROM THE HEMP SHIRTS
TO THE BRIEFCASES.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL THISNEW BIG BUSINESS JUST LIKE
BIG TOBACCO AND BIG LIQUORON THE NOTION THAT THEY CAN
MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF PEOPLELIKE ME WHO ARE ADDICTS
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEIRMONEY IS.
THEIR MONEY IS IN PEOPLELIKE ME WHO LIKE TO USE MORE
THAN IS REALLY ACCEPTABLE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THAT ISTHE ONE-- THAT IS THE ONE,
THAT IS THE ONE PART OF THISTHAT I DO LIKE.
BECAUSE AS AN INVESTOR, IJUST FOUND OUT THERE IS THIS
WHOLE ENORMOUS MARKET CALLEDPOT THAT HAS BEEN MAKING
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF BOOKFOR YEARS.
NOW I CAN PUT MY MONEY INCOLORADO COMPANIES THAT ARE
GETTING THE STANKIEST BUDPOSSIBLE, OKAY, AND I CAN
MAKE A BUTT LOAD OF CASH,WHY SHOULDN'T I DO THAT.
>> THAT IS THE BIG THINGABOUT THIS NEW INDUSTRY.
THEY'RE GOING TO ADVERTISE.
SO YOU GET FREE JOINTS WHEN YOUGET YOUR LIFT TICKET YOU GET
FREE JOINTS WHEN YOU GO-- .
>> Stephen: IS THATHAPPENING.
>> YEAH, THAT'S REALLY.
>> Stephen: THE PARTY ISHAPPENING.
>> AND YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GETTHE BROWNIES AND COOKIES ALL
THC.
YOU CAN GET SODAS WITH THC.
BUT MOST PEOPLE THINKLEGALIZATION IS ALLOWING ME
TO SMOKE MARIJUANA ON THEWEEKENDS.
IT'S TO YOU BEING ABLE TOSELL PRODUCTS WITH THC IN
IT.
>> Stephen: NOW I WANT IT TO BEILLEGAL AGAIN. HERE IS THE
THING.
IF YOU GET ARRESTED YOU GOTO JAIL, OKAY.
YOU ARE FORDECRIMINALIZATION.
>> I'M FOR KEEPING ITILLEGAL BUT FOR ALTERNATIVE
SENTENCING.
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD PAYFINES.
I THINK THEY SHOULD GETTREATMENT IF THEY NEED IT.
AND THAT IS WHY I PASSED THEMENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND
MENTAL ADDICTION ACT.
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE ACHECKUP FROM THE NECK UP.
>> Stephen: SO INSTEAD OFGOING TO JAIL, YOU GO TO
REHAB.
>> SO, WELL, REHABS AREGOING TO LOVE THIS.
>> Stephen: I SHOULD INVESTIN REHABS.
>> YOU SHOULD INVEST INREHAB BECAUSE THE BIGGEST
NEW ADMISSION NOW, AND ITSURPASSES COCAINE AND
ALCOHOL AND METHIS MARIJUANA, BELIEVE
IT OR NOT.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> INVEST IN THAT AND INVESTIN MARIJUANA, YOU WILL MAKE
OUT IN BOTH RESPECTS, YES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU SMOKE POT,YOU DON'T DO SUBSTANCE ABUSE
ANY MORE.
DID YOU SMOKE POT.
>> IF THE KIND OF MARIJUANATHAT IS AVAILABLE TODAY WAS
AVAILABLE BACK WHEN I WASTRYING IT, I COULD HAVE
EATEN IT BECAUSE IT'S THESEEDIBLES THAT-- BECAUSE I HAD
ASTHMA, I MOVED ON TO OTHERTHINGS TO GET HIGH.
I DIDN'T SMOKE-- .
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,WAIT A SECOND.
SO IF POT IS ILLEGAL THENMAYBE WOULD YOU HAVE STOPPED
WITH POT.
>> I MIGHT HAVE STOPPED WITHPOT BUT THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE
FINALLY REALIZED THAT I HADA PROBLEM BECAUSE MARIJUANA
WOULD HAVE KEPT ME ON THESLOW TRAIN TO NOWHERE A LOT
LONGER THAN COCAINE ORALCOHOL.
WHERE IT'S PRETTY HARD AFTERA WHILE TO IGNORE THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVE AN ADDICTION.
BUT MARIJUANA, YOU CAN SMOKEIT FOR A LONG TIME AND STILL
BE IN DENIAL,.
YOU KNOW, MY DENIAL WASTOUGH TO BREAK.
I WAS ARRESTED FOR SEVERALTIMES.
I WAS HUMILIATED BUT WITHMARIJUANA I PROBABLY WOULD
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAYWITH IT A LOT LONGER THAT
I DID.
>> Stephen: I TOLD YOU THEREWERE TWO THINGS THAT WORRY
ME.
THE OTHER IS THAT IF WE MAKEMARIJUANA LEGAL
IT MIGHT CUT INTO XANAX SALES BECAUSE PHARMACEUTICALS
THOSE THINGSHAVE GOT A SWEET LITTLE EDGE
TO THEM.
SHOULD WE MAKEPHARMACEUTICALS ILLEGAL AS
WELL?
BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLYADDICTIVE.
>> WELL, IT'S LIKEOXYCONTIN WHICH I WAS
ADDICTED TO.
>> Stephen: WAS IT LOVELY.
>> YEAH, IT FELT REALLYGOOD.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'SNOW PERMISSIVE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITHMAKING MARIJUANA LEGAL IS IT
A PERMISSIVE I'M, SAYING OH,IT'S MEDICINE, I WILL TAKE T
I WILL FEEL BETTER.
AND I REALLY WORRY ABOUT THEFUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.
AND WITH THE ANXIETY LEVELOF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, THE
STRESS OF OUR KIDS, WE'REJUST ADDING SOMETHING ELSE
THAT MAY IN THE SHORT RUNMAKE THEM FEEL BETTER BUT IN
THE LONG RUN IS GOING TOREALLY COST THEM AND COST
OUR COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: PATRICK, THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: PATRICK KENNEDY.
PROJECT SAM, WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK.
