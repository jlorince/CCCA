[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING TONIGHT'S BROADCAST.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, FOLKS, YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S ONE
STORY ROCKING THIS NATION.
A BOMBSHELL DROPPED BY MY HERO, LANCE ARMSTRONG, MASTER OF THE TWO WHEELER.
RUMORS HAVE BEEN SWIRLING FOR YEARS ABOUT LANCE, BUT UNLIKE MOST AMERICANS, WHEN TIMES GOT
TOUGH, I DIDN'T GET OFF THE TANDEM BIKE OF ADMIRATION.
NO!
I SADDLED UP, RANG THE BELL OF LOYALTY, PUT DOWN THE KICKSTAND OF SUPPORT, STAYED IN IT TO
SCHWINN IT, AND-- I'VE RUN OUT OF BIKE METAPHORS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
POINT IS, THE MAN'S  A HERO.
HE BEAT CANCER.
THEN WENT ON TO BEAT SOMETHING EVEN LESS POPULAR: THE FRENCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, YESTERDAY HE FINALLY BROKE HIS SILENCE IN AN EXPLOSIVE SIT DOWN WITH OPRAH.
NOW, IT DOESN'T AIR UNTIL THURSDAY AND SECURITY AROUND THE INTERVIEW HAS BEEN TIGHTER THAN
LANCE'S PANTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
SO, OF COURSE, ALL THE CABLE NEWS NETWORKS ARE REPORTING IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LADY O REFUSES TO RELEASE ANY CLIPS TO THE NEWS MEDIA, BUT INSTEAD.
SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER BEST FRIEND GAYLE'S BEST CBS "THIS MORNING" CO-HOST CHARLIE ROSE TO
GIVE US HER REACTION TO WHAT SHE WON'T TELL US LANCE SAID.
>> Stephen: WELL SORRY, OPRAH.
I'M NOT PLAYING INTO YOUR LITTLE P.R. STUNT.
IF YOU WON'T TELL US WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND LANCE, I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A
JOURNALIST TO MAKE SOMETHING UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS JUST IN: LANCE ARMSTRONG BANGED OPRAH!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[ LAUGHTER ]
JIMMY -- LET'S GO TO THE TAPE.
>> HE BROUGHT IT.
HE REALLY DID.
LITERALLY TWO AND A HALF HOURS.
WE WERE BOTH PRETTY EXAUSTED.
AND, UM, I WOULD SAY I WAS SATISFIED.
ABOUT AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES IN, WE TOOK A BREAK AND LANCE ACTUALLY SAID, "WILL THERE BE A
POINT WHERE YOU LIGHTEN UP?" I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WAS SATISFIED.
WE'VE DECIDED THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO GO FOR TWO NIGHTS.
THE WORD I KEEP USING IS SATISFIED.
WHRAF LAUGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: YES, SIR.
SOUNDS LIKE LANCE GAVE HER A ONE-NIGHT SUB
