[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS.
FOLKS, THE NUMBER-ONE ISSUE ON
EVERYONE'S MIND TODAY IS JOBS.
IT'S EVEN REPLACED SEX, WHICH
MEANS MEN NOW FANTASIZE ABOUT
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN GIVING THEM
START PAPERWORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT pRESIDENT
OBAMA IS REVEALING HIS JOBS
PLAN.
AND IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO
GET OUR ATTENTION, HE'S DOING IT
IN A SPEECH BEFORE A JOINT
SESSION OF CONGRESS.
NOW HE'S ASKING HIS OPPONENTS TO
JOIN WITH HIM FOR THE GOOD OF
THE PEOPLE, AND REPUBLICAN
LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL HAS
AGREED TO PUT ASIDE
PARTISANSHIP:
>> WE'LL LISTEN POLITELY TO WHAT
HE HAS TO SAY AND TAKE A LOOK AT
IT, BUT OUR VIEW IS THAT WE NEED
TO GO IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
DIRECTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: SEERK THAT'S
MEETING OBAMA HALFWAY.
THEY'LL LISTEN POLITELY TO
SOMETHING THEY'VE ALREADY
REJECTED.
AND TO SHOW THEIR CONCERN FOR
THE UNEMPLOYED MANY GOP MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS HAVE COME UP WITH
THEIR OWN PLAN oF NOT ATTENDING
THE SPEECH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THE PRESIDENT WON'T BE
TALKING TO AN EMPTY ROOM.
JUST LIKE THE OSCARS, CONGRESS
HAS SEAT FILLERS-- PEOPLE WHO
OCCUPY THE CHAIRS BUT SERVE NO
REAL PURPOSE-- THEY'RE CALLED
DEMOCRATS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
SKIPPING THE SPEECH ISN'T JUST
SOME F-U TO THE PRESIDENT.
ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS HAVE A
GOOD REASON, LIKE LOUISIANA
SENATOR AND "FORMER" WHORE
ROTISSERIE DAVID VITTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
VITTER IS GOING TO BE AT HOME.
>> I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING FROM
MY FAMILY ROOM IN METAIRIE,
LOUISIANA, BECAUSE I HAVE A
SAINTS GAME PARTY THERE, AND I'M
ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE THERE FOR
THE BIG GAME.
AS A FANATIC, I HAVE MY
PRIORITIES.
>> Stephen: YEAH!
PRIORITIES.
THERE'S ONLY ONE KICKOFF GAME,
BUT THERE'LL BE YEARS MORE
CRIPPLING UNEMPLOYMENT.
IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE
SAINTS/PACKERS GAME, SOME
NBC AFFILIATES IN WISCONSIN
AREN'T EVEN CARRYING THE SPEECH.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT WATCHING
THE SPEECH EITHER.
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE WISCONSIN
PAC-MEN.
TIME TO TAILGATE.
LET'S DO THIS RIGHT HERE.
LET'S GO.
LET'S FIRE UP THE GRILL.
ALL RIGHT.
JOHN THE JOHNSONVILLE BRATS
GOING.
I CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH THAT
FOOTBALL.
I JUST ENJOYING -- ENJOY
WATCHING THAT BIG GUY TACK THAT
OTHER GUY FOR THE POINTS.
I LOVE WATCHING THE POINTS.
I GOT A SIXER OF OLD MILWAUKEE
HERE.
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A FEW
I GOT A SIXER OF OLD MILWAUKEE,
AND A SIXER OF LISTERINE TO WASH
AWAY THE TASTE OF THE OLD
MILWAUKEE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND TO MAKE SURE MY TV DOESN'T
ACCIDENTALLY CLICK OVER TO
OBAMA'S SPEECH, I'M GO TO REMOVE
THE BATTERIES FROM MY REMOTE
HERE.
AND I AM GOING TO REPLACE THOSE
WITH MINI SAUSAGES.
THERE YOU GO.
TAKE THAT UP.
AND, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
I STILL HAVE POWER.
ANYWAY, OF COURSE, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH TAILGATING.
OF COURSE, THE MOST
CONTROVERSIAL ASPECT OF THE
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH WAS THE DATE
WHICH OBAMA ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED
FOR LAST NIGHT.
>> IT WAS THE TIMING OF THE
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH THAT BECAME
THE SUBJECT OF A TESTY
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER.
>> THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SCHEDULED
FOR THE SAME TIME THE PRESIDENT
WANTED TO SPEAK
>> Stephen hONESTLY I ADMIRE THE
PRESIDENT FOR HAVING THE
SWINGING AIR-FORCE-TWOS TO TRY
AND BIGFOOT THE REPUBLICAN
DEBATE.
IT'S THE SAME REASON I CELEBRATE
MY BIRTHDAY ON ALL OF MY STAFF'S
BIRTHDAYS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SPEAKING OF WHICH, HAPPY
BIRTHDAY, GLENN.
NOW, WHERE THE HELL IS MY GIFT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
REALLY TASTES LIKE MICHIGAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I SAY IF THE PRESIDENT IS SO
DESPERATE FOR HIS SPEECH TO GET
OUR ATTENTION, LAST NIGHT, THIS
NIGHT, IT DON'T MATTER.
TO REACH THE UNEMPLOYED HE NEEDS
TO DELIVER IT WHEN THE UNEMPLOY
READY WATCHING TV.
AT 3:00 A.M. RIGHT AFTER A
SLAP-CHOP INFOMERICAL.
BY THE WAY, I PARTIALLY BLAME
THE SLAP CHOP FOR THIS
UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS.
IT CHOPS, DICES AND MINCES!
THAT'S THREE JOBS IT KILLED!
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, BETTER YET, THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD JUST WORK HIS MESSAGE IN
TO THE PROGRAMMING THAT'S
ALREADY ON AT THAT HOUR.
JIM?
>> ARE YOU CONSTANTLY STRUG WELL
YOUR STRAP?
>> RIGHT NOW THERE ARE FOLKS
STRUGGLING.
>> WHEN YOU WEAR A TURTLE NECK
YOU LOOK LIKE THIS?
>> DEMOCRACY ISN'T ALWAYS
PRETTY.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY.
>> WE'VE PROVEN WE CAN COME
TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.
>> INTRODUCING THE ALL NEW GENIE
BRA.
>> THAT'S HOW WE'LL MEET THIS
CHALLENGE.
>> THAT SLEEK SILLO WET.
THIS IS THE PERFECT BRA FOR ME.
>> THAT'S THE SPIRIT WE NEED TO
HARNESS IT.
>> BARACK OBAMA'S BRAS AND JOBS.
ORDER NOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOW, OUR ECONOMY ALREADY SEEMS
FULLER, PERKIER AND MORE
CONFIDENT IN A TANK TOP.
