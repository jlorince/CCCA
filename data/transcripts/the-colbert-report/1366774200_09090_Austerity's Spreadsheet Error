>> Stephen: RUT-ROH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NATION, THANKS TO THE SEQUESTER,
IF YOU HAVE FLOWN IN THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS YOU MAY HAVE
NOTICED THAT YOU DIDN'T FLY IN
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
JIM?
>> STAFFING CUTS STARTED
YESTERDAY FOR AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROLLERS.
>> HERE COMES MAXIMUM PAIN.
AIR TRAVELERS, LISTEN UP.
YOUR CHANCES OF A FLIGHT DELAY
JUST WENT UP.
>> FEDERAL BUDGET CUTS ARE NOW
HITTING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO TAKE
EXTRA DAYS OFF.
>> ABOUT 400 FLIGHTS WERE
DELAYED BECAUSE OF THESE
FURLOUGHS.
>> PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN BOARDING
ON TIME BUT WAIT UP TO THREE
HOURS FOR THEIR FLIGHTS TO TAKE
OFF.
>> Stephen: OH, YES, THE
SEQUESTER CHICKENS HAVE COME
HOME TO ROOST.
OR THEY WOULD HAVE HAVE IF THEY
COULD GET CLEARANCE TO TAKE OFF.
BUT WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE, FOLKS.
IN BAD TIMES, YOU HAVE TO SLASH
GOVERNMENT SPHENDING.
AND I DON'T NEED SOME FANCY IVY
LEAGUE PAPER TO TELL ME THAT.
BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A FANCY
IVY LEAGUE PAPER TO TELL ME
THAT.
THE FAMOUS 2010 STUDY "GROWTH IN
A TIME OF DEBT" BY HARVARD
ECONOMISTS KEN ROGOFF AND CAR
MEN REINHART.
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK HARVARD
ECONOMISTS UNDERSTAND DEBT.
ALMOST AS MUCH AS HARVARD
GRADUATES.
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT FISCAL
CONSERVATIVES ALL YES ROGOFF AND
REINHART TO MAKE THE CASE FOR
DRASTIC BUDGET CUTS.
>> I HAD ALWAYS HEARD IF IT GETS
TO 90% THAT'S A TIPPING POINT.
THAT'S WHEN ECONOMIC GROWTH
STARTS TO SLOW.
ROGOFF AND REINHART SHOWED THAT.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT ROGOFF AND
REINHART, WHAT THEY SAY, YOU
HAVE TO CONSIDER GROSS DEBT
WHERE OVER 100%.
>> ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE STUDIED
SOVEREIGN DEBT TELL US THAT
LETTING TOTAL DEBT RISE ABOVE
90% OF G.D.P. CREATES A DRAG ON
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INTENSIFIES
THE RISK OF A DEBT-FUELED
ECONOMIC CRISIS.
>> Stephen: YES A DEBT-FUELED
ECONOMIC CRISIS.
THAT WOULD PLUNGE US INTO
ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION.
AND DRAG THE ENTIRE WORLD DOWN
WITH IT.
NOT ONLY, NOT ONLY HAS CONGRESS
BEEN INSPIRED BY ROGAINE AND
BRAVEHEART'S MATH, THEIR WORK
HAS INFLUENCED INTERNATIONAL
BUDGET SLASHERS LIKE E.U.
ECONOMICS COMMISSIONER OLLI
REHN, FORMER EUROPEAN CENTRAL
BANK PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE
TRICHET, BUNDESBANK PRESIDENT
JENS WEIDMANN AND LORD LAMONT OF
LERWICK WHO IS NOT ONLY THE
FORMER CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUER FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM
BUT GETS KILLED BY LARRY MARY IN
THE NEXT SEASON OF DOWN TON
ANDY.
OF COURSE, THE LEFT WING IVORY
TOWER ACADEMIA-HOLES OUT THERE
COULDN'T STAND THAT
CONSERVATIVES LIKE CROCKETT AND
TUBBS HERE WERE RIGHT SO THEY
PROVED THEM WRONG.
>> THE ECONOMIC THEORY
UNDERPINNING AUSTERITY POLICIES
BEING FOLLOWED BY GOVERNMENTS
WORLDWIDE MAY BE FLAWED.
THAT IS THE ALLEGATION MADE IN A
STUDY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF
MASSACHUSETTS.
IT CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND CODING
ERRORS ON THE EXCEL SPREADSHEET
USED BY THE ACADEMICS WHO HAVE
PRODUCED THE THEORY WHICH COULD
INVALIDATE THEIR CONCLUSIONS.
>> Stephen: THE UNIVERSITY OF
MASSACHUSETTS FOUND CODING
ERRORS THAT INVALIDATE
CONCLUSIONS.
NERRRRDS!
I BET YOU FOUND THEM ON A FRIDAY
NIGHT WITH YOUR MOM.
WHILE THE REST OF US WERE GOING
UP TO THE POINT AND DRINKING
P.B.R.
I PUKED IN DAVE CON ROY'S GLOVE
COMPARTMENT.
IT WAS A GOOD TIME.
AND JUST LOOK AT THE POINDEXTER
WHO CAUGHT THE MISTAKES.
THOMAS HERNDON WHO REVIEWED
THEIR DATA AND IMMEDIATELY
SPOTTED A BASIC SPREADSHEET
ERROR AND THAT THEY HAD EXCLUDED
DATA FROM CANADA, NEW ZEALAND,
AUSTRALIA ALL COUNTRIES THAT ARE
EXPERIENCED SOLID GROWTH DURING
PERIODS OF HIGH DEBT AND WOULD
THUS UNDERCUT THEIR THESIS.
IF IGNORING NEW ZEALAND,
AUSTRALIA AND CANADA WERE A
CRIME, EVERYONE IN AMERICA WOULD
BE ON DEATH ROW.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW SURE, HERNDON'S CORRECTED
SPREADSHEETS SHOW THAT COUNTRIES
WITH DEBT OVER 90% DID NOT SEE
THEIR ECONOMIES SHRINK MINUS
POINT-ONE PERCENT BUT INSTEAD
SAW THEM GROW 2.2%.
BUT COME ON, 2.2% UP, .1% DOWN,
YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY ELIMINATE
FOOD STAMPS.
FOR PETE'S SAKE, HOW WERE REN
AND STIMPY SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT
THEIR PAPER, THEIR PAPER WHICH
HAS BROUGHT AUSTERITY TO
MILLIONS WAS FLAWED?
IT WASN'T PEER REVIEWED.
SO, NO ONE NEEDS TO FACT-CHECK
THEM.
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SAID THEY
WERE WATCHING SCOOBY DOO WHEN
THEY WERE FOUR.
AFTER PUBLICATION IN 2010, ONE
ECONOMIST COMPLAINED THAT THEY
REFUSED TO SHARE THEIR DATA.
OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T SHARE
THEIR DATA.
IF THEY CAN'T USE EXCEL, I DOUBT
THEY COULD SEND IT AN EMAIL
ATTACHMENT.
BUT, FOLKS, SIEGFRIED AND ROY
ARE STANDING BY THEIR RESULTS
SAYING QUOTE THE WEIGHT OF THE
EVIDENCE TO DATE, INCLUDING THIS
LATEST COMMENT BY HERNDON, SEEMS
ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH OUR
ORIGINAL INTERPRETATION OF THE
DATA.
RIGHT.
ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR
INTERPRETATION BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW MUCH THE RESULTS CHANGE, THE
HYPOTHESIS MUST REMAIN THE SAME.
THAT'S SCIENCE.
WELL, FOLKS, NOW THAT I KNOW
ACADEMIC PAPERS DON'T HAVE TO BE
ALL MATH-Y TO MAKE A GLOBAL
IMPACT, I'VE GOT SOME OF MY OWN
COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED FINDINGS
I WOULD LIKE TO DROP.
FOR INSTANCE, HYDROFRACKING
MAKES YOUR ASS LOOK BETTER IN
JEANS.
CRUDE OIL: NATURE'S EGRET
MOISTURIZER.
AND HOLSTER V. BRA: HOW GUN
CONTROL CAUSES MAN LOOFER BOOBS.
HOW GUN CONTROL CAUSES MANBOOBS.
AND UNLIKE BANGER AND MASH, MY
STUDIES ARE PIER-REVIEWED IN
THAT I SHOWED THEM TO SOME SEA
GULLS ON A PIER.
AND I CAN SAY,.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND I CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY THAT I DID NOT MAKE A
SINGLE ERROR IN MY EXCEL
SPREADSHEET BECAUSE FOR THESE
STUDIES I USED "ANGRY BIRDS STAR
WARS."
BOTTOM LINE, BARTLES & JAMES'
STUDY IS STILL VALID NO MATTER
WHAT SOME PUNK U-MASS AMHERST
E-CON GRAD STUDENT NAMED THOMAS
HERNDON SAYS.
AND WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL BE
JOINED BY PUNK-ASS AMHERST E-CON
GRAD STUDENT
