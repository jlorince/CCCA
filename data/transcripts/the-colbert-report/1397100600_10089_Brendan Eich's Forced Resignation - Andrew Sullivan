HERE TO PERSECUTE ME FURTHERIS BLOGGER, FOUNDER OF THE
DISH AND A MAN WHO IS A GAY,SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY IN
FAVOURING OF FIRING BRENDANEICH.
MR. ANDREW SULLIVAN.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMINGBACK.
OKAY, ANDREW, LET'S HAVETELEPHONE.
YOUR SIDE WON, LET'S HAVEYOUR END ZONE DACHBLTS YOU
GOT THE SCALP OF BRENDANEICH, GO?
>> WELL, FORGIVE ME, I'M NOTGOING QUITE GLOCHLT I
ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE COMEA LONG WAY ON GAY RIGHTS
BECAUSE OPEN, TOLERANCE,PERSUADED PEOPLE BY REASON
AND HAVEN'T JUMPED DOWNEVERYBODY'S VOTES WHO
DISAGREED WITH US AND CALLTHEM A BIGOT AND GET THEM
FIRED.
I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT KINDOF TEN OR AND THAT IMPULSE
SO PUNISH PEOPLE THE THINGSTHAT THEY SER SIN VEERLY
BELIEVE.
-- SINCERELY BELIEVE.
LAUGH LATCH LAUGH-- (LAUGHTER)
>> YOU HAVE LOST ME HERE,YOU'VE LOST ME HERE FOR A
SECOND IS THAT SOME KIND OFGAY CODE THAT I'M TO THE
GETTING?
OR SOMETHING?
HOW YOU CAN-- HOW YOU CANNOT,HOW YOU CAN-- YOU'RE GAY
MARRIED.
>> I AM VERY GAY MARRIED.
>> THAT GUY DIDN'T WANT YOUTO BE ABLE TO BE GAY MARRIED
AND YOU STILL THINK PEOPLEWITHOUT SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE
SHOULD STILL DO BUSINESSWITH HIM.
>> NOT IF THEY DON'T WANTTO.
BUT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE AREFORCED TO RESIGN, WHEN
PEOPLE START LOSING THEIRJOBS, WHEN PEOPLE IN THE
WORKPLACE ESPECIALLY AREUNDER THREAT, WILL FEEL
THREATENED, THE THINGS THEYDO COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE
WORKPLACE, THEIR POLITICALVIEWS, IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU
ACTUALLY FIRED SOMEONE FORPOLITICAL VIEW YOU
DISAPPROVED OF, IT WOULD BEAGAINST THE LAW.
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'TWANT TO BRING THIS KIND OF
POLITICAL WARFARE INTO THEWORKPLACE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GETALONG WITH PEOPLE WHO
SINCERELY, PASSIONATELY YOUDISAGREE WITH.
>> NO, WE DON'T, NO, NO(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> NO!
LOOK, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WORSETHAN MAKE MY AUDIENCE GAY,
YOU'VE MADE THEM REASONABLE.
OKAY.
BUT LISTEN, I LIVE MY LIFEBY A POLICY, SOMEONE
DISAGREED WITH ME, I PUT MYHEAD ON A SPIKE AND I SAY
THIS WAS MY ENEMY.
NOW I HAVE HIS HEAD.
ISN'T THAT THE WAY YOU GUYSGOT YOUR GAY RIGHTS.
ARIZONA INTRODUCES SOME LAWABOUT GAY MARRIAGE, BOYCOTT
ARIZONA.
COME ON, YOU CAN'T TELL MEYOU GUYS DIDN'T USE REAL
MUSCLE.
>> NO, TOTALLY BOYCOTTS ANDSOCIAL PRESSURE ARE FINE.
WHERE I DRAW THE LINE ISWHEN WE START TARGETING
INDIVIDUALS FOR PUNISHMENTOR CALLING THEM HERETIC OR
BIGOTS OR HATERS WITHOUTGIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO
REALLY EXPLAIN THEMSELVES,TO TALK AND ASSESS THEY ARE
REASONABLE HUMAN BEINGS THATMIGHT HAVE COME TO THIS
CONCLUSION FOR GOOD REASON.
NOW LOOK, I THINK WE HAVEACTUALLY PERSUADE PEOPLE, WE
HAVE MADE ARGUMENTS.
AND I DON'T THINK THATEVERYBODY TODAY DIDN'T
SUPPORT SAME SEX MARRIAGE ISA HATEFUL BIGOT.
I DON'T.
I THINK A THIRD OF THECOUNTRY HAVE CHANGED THEIR
MIND WERE THEY ALL BIGOTSTEN YEARS AGO.
I THINK BARACK OBAMA CHANGEDHIS MIND.
WAS HE A BIGOT IN 2009.
OF COURSE NOT.
>> HE'S A BIGOT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I, I-- I
MAY-- I MAY NOT AGREE WITHWHAT YOU SAY BUT I WILL
FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR MYRIGHT TO HAVE YOU FIRED FOR
SAYING IT.
ANDREW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.ANDREW SULLIVAN, WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK.
