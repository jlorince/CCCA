( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT,
OF COURSE, WE ARE BROADCASTING
LIVE FROM THE ALTERNATIVE STUDIO
I HAVE MOUNTED ON THE BELLY OF A
DIRIGIBLE SAILING HIGH OVER
INTERNATIONAL WATERS ALL TO
PROTECT US FROM THE HOT, SWEATY
MASS OF MAN MEAT THAT IS NO
DOUBT WRITHING OVER THE FACE OF
OUR ONCE GREAT NATION.
JIMMY, TELL 'EM WHY.
>> WE BEGIN WITH THIS BREAKING
NEWS FROM THE SUPREME COURT.
DOMA, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE
ACT, RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> DOMA A LAW THAT'S BEEN ON THE
BOOKS FOR 17 YEARS HAS BEEN
STRUCK DOWN IN A 5-4 RULING
WHICH MEANS COUPLES MARRIED IN
ONE OF THE STATES WHERE SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE IS LEGAL WILL HAVE THE
RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS TO ARE
CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO
OPPOSITE-SEX MARRIED COUPLES
UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW.
>> THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT
IS FINALLY DEAD AND GONE.
>> Stephen: THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT IS DEAD.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TRADITIONAL... LIKE MY AUDIENCE,
I CLAP WHEN I'M AFRAID.
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS NOW AS
DEFENSELESS AS A FRESHMAN FRAT
PLEDGE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THE
SPANKING MACHINE.
SO STRAIGHT MARRIED PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.
IF A GAY CHARGES YOUR MARRIAGE
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PUFF
YOURSELF UP, MAKE YOURSELF SEEM
BIGGER, TRY TO FRIGHTEN IT OFF
BY TALKING IN A FIRM, LOUD VOICE
ABOUT PLEATED DENIM OR JIMMY
BUFFET.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
IT WILL SCARE 'EM OFF.
FOLKS, I FOR ONE CANNOT BELIEVE
THE COURT THREW OUT DOMA.
IT WAS PASSED IN 1996 TO
GUARANTEE THAT TRADITIONAL
MARRIAGE WAS BETWEEN ONE MAN AND
ONE WOMAN FOR THE SACRED PURPOSE
OF GETTING BILL CLINTON
RE-ELECTED.
LISTEN, FOLKS, TO THEIR
SO-CALLED JUDICIAL REASONING.
>> DOMA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS A
DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY OF
PERSONS THAT IS PROTECTED UNDER
THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.
OH, PLEASE.
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
THERE ARE AMENDMENTS AFTER THE
SECOND.
SOUNDS MADE UP.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS.
IF DOMA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL,
THAT MEANS THE CONSTITUTION IS
GAY.
OF COURSE, I MEAN, NO REAL
SHOCKER.
IT WAS WRITTEN BY A BUNCH OF
DUDES IN WIGS AND TIGHTS IN THE
CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE.
AND IT CALLS FOR A LEGISLATURE
THAT IS BI-CAP RAL?
THAT'S A BIT CURIOUS.
PLUS LOOK AT THAT AGED PARCHMENT
AND FANCY CALLIGRAPHY.
LOOKS LIKE A GAY WEDDING
INVITATION.
ON THE BACK, I BET IT ASKS YOU
TO CHECK SALMON OR VEGAN PAELLA.
THAT COULD BE NATIONAL TREASURE
3.
CALL ME, NICK CAGE.
WORST OF ALL, FOLKS, IN SETTLING
THIS GAY MARRIAGE CONTROVERSY,
THEY IN FACT SETTLED NOTHING.
>> THE THING ABOUT STRIKING DOWN
DOMA IS IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANY
STATE'S RIGHT TO BAN OR TO ALLOW
SAME SEX MARRIAGE.
>> WE HAVE MARRIAGE RIGHTS IN
CALIFORNIA.
WE'VE GOT MARRIAGE RIGHTS
OVERALL IN 12 STATES AND WE'VE
GOT FEDERAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS BUT
WE STILL HAVE UNEQUAL
RECOGNITION OF MARRIAGES IN 38
OTHER STATES SO WE DO HAVE A
VERY INTERESTING PATCHWORK
SYSTEM.
>> Stephen: THE SUPREMES REALLY
SCREWED THE POOCH HERE WHICH I'M
SURE IS ALSO LEGAL NOW.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU'RE MARRIED IN NEW YORK.
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED IN ALABAMA.
WHAT GIVES?
I'M AS CONFUSED AS A FRESHMAN
FRAT PLEDGE WHO REALLY ENJOYED
