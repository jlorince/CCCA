>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PULITZER
PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST WHO
RECENTLY ADMITTED HE'S AN
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, SO I WILL PAY
HIM HALF OF THE NOTHING I PAY MY
GUESTS.
PLEASE WELCOME JOSE ANTONIO
VARGAS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY.
MR. VARGAS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
YOU ARE A JOURNALIST, TRUE?
>> YES, YES, I AM.
>> Stephen: SAN FRANCISCO
CHRONICLE, NEW YORKER,
WASHINGTON POST, PART OF THE
POST'S PULITZER PRIZE WINNING
TEA PARTY FOR COVERAGE OF THE
VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE, AND IN
JUNE YOU WROTE AN ESSAY FOR THE
"TIMES" MAGAZINE ENTITLED "MY
LIFE AS AN UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANT."
YOU'RE ABILLEGAL ALIEN.
>> NEW YORK I'M UNDOCUMENTED.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE WHAT WE IN
THE AMERICAN WORLD CALLED "AN
ILLEGAL."
YOU'RE AN ILLEGAL.
I THINK I'VE BROKEN THE LAW JUST
HAVING YOU IN MY STUDIO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO, THIS IS ACTUALLY AN
IMPORTANT POINT.
I DON'T WANT LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD
SITTING IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA THINKING
THAT HE OR SHE IS ILLEGAL.
HUMAN BEINGS ARE...
>> Stephen: THE COPS ARE
COMING FROM YOU, JUNIOR.
PUT A CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE
DOORKNOB BECAUSE THE FEDERALES
ARE COMING.
YOU CAME FROM MEXICO, RIGHT?
>> NO, NO, I'M FROM THE
PHILIPPINES.
>>
>> Stephen: THAT'S WARMER
MEXICO.
YOU GET YOUR SOMBRERO, YOU
PADDLE OVER HERE TO TAKE
AMERICAN JOBS.
>> NO, SIR.
STEEP OPEN THE WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
>> BASICALLY MY MOM SENT ME TO
AMERICA WHEN I WAS 12 TO VISIT
MY GRANDPARENTS.
AND IT WAS...
>> Stephen: WAS THAT LEGAL?
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS LEGAL.
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS FINE.
>> Stephen: YOU THOUGHT.
>> I THOUGHT.
I WAS 12678 WHEN I WAS 16, I
WENT TO THE D.M.V. TO GET MY
DRIVER'S PERMIT.
WHEN I SHOWED HER MY GREEN CARD.
SHE FLIPPED IT AROUND AND SAID
IT'S FAKE, DON'T COME BACK HERE
AGAIN.
THAT'S WHEN I FOUND OUT.
AS A LOT OF OTHER UNDOCUMENTED
KIDS FIND OUT.
THEY DON'T FIND OUT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S SHOCKING.
SOMEONE AT THE D.M.V. WAS NICE
TO YOU.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S UNHEARD OF.
[APPLAUSE]
>> TO THIS DAY, CURLY HAIR,
GLASSES.
I DO NOT KNOW HER NAME.
TO THIS DAY I WISH I COULD GIVE
HER A REALLY, REALLY BIG HUG
BECAUSE, YEAH, I OWE KIND OF A
LOT TO HER.
SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE
IN MY LIFE, THE SECOND ONE WAS
MY CHOIR TEACHER, SHE WAS FIRST
ADULT I TOLD AT SCHOOL BECAUSE
SHE WANTED THE CHOIR TO GO JAPAN
FOR A TOUR.
AND I TOLD HER I COULDN'T GO AND
SHE SAID, WELL, WHY NOT.
I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE THE
PASSPORT.
SHE SAID, I'LL GET YOU THE RIGHT
PASSPORT.
WHEN I TOLD HER I WAS
UNDOCUMENTED, SHE SAID THE NEXT
DAY, THE CLASS WAS GOING TO GO
TO HAWAII INSTEAD OF JAPAN.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> HER NAME IS MRS. DENNY.
>> Stephen: YOU RUINED THEIR
TRIP.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU RUINED A LIFE-CHANGING TRIP
FOR THOSE KIDS.
>> I OWE THAT CLASS, TO THIS
DAY, THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
HAD TO GO TO HAWAII INSTEAD OF
JAPAN, BUT MRS. DENNY, THAT
WAS... SHE'S BEEN A PART OF IT.
I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO IT AS...
REFERRING TO HER AS PART OF MY
21st CENTURY UNDERGROUND
RAILROAD.
TEACHERS, PASTORS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE
PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>> WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?
>> Stephen: LISTEN TO ME,
BECAUSE SHE ENABLED A CRIME.
OKAY.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE PEOPLE
OUT THERE WHO ARE ENABLING GUYS
LIKE YOU TO STAY IN THE UNITED
STATES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SKIP THE NORMAL
PROCESS.
>> BUT AS YOU KNOW, EVEN YOUR
PRESIDENT, GEORGE W. BUSH, HE
KNEW THAT THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
WAS BROKEN IN 2006 WHEN HE GAVE
A PRIME TIME SPEECH ON.
THIS SO PEOPLE LIKE HIM HAVE
SAID THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY WE
VOTED HIM OUT OF OFFICE, SIR.
THAT'S WHY WE VOTED BUSH OUT OF
OFFICE.
MADE A HUGE MISTAKE, THERE.
SO WHY DID YOU FINALLY COME OUT
OF THE CLOSET AS AN ILLEGAL
ALIEN.
>> AS AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT.
>> Stephen: WHATEVER.
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE ALSO A GAY
MAN.
>> YES, I AM.
>> Stephen: WHICH WAS HARDER
COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET, A GAY
MAN OR AS A BORDER GAY?
THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED.
THAT'S EXACTLY THE TERM.
BORDER GAY.
>> WE LIVE IN A GREAT COUNTRY
THAT DOESN'T DEPORT GAY PEOPLE,
SO I'M VERY, VERY PAPI ABOUT
THAT.
I DECIDED TO COME FORWARD
BECAUSE I E-MAIL ONE OF 11
MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN
THIS COUNTRY.
I CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT.
IN THE SPAN OF TWO DAYS; 0,000
PEOPLE HAVE PLEDGED TO TALK
ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN A DIFFERENT
WAY.
WE CAME HERE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANTS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,
WE NEED TO GET THE POLITICS OUT
OF IT AND REALLY TALK ABOUT HOW
BROKEN THE SYSTEM IS.
YOU KNOW IT'S BROKEN.
>>
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S BROKEN.
IT'S WORKING FOR ME BECAUSE MY
JOB IS TO ARGUE ABOUT IT, AND IT
SEEMS TO BE WORKING FOR ME.
>> THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH ARGUING
GOING ON.
THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH ARGUING
GOING ON AND NOT ENOUGH
SOLUTIONS.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE AN
ORGANIZATION CALLED...
>> DEFINE AMERICAN DOT COM.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF "DEFINE
AMERICAN."
THAT SOUNDS AGGRESSIVE, YOU'RE
NOT AMERICAN.
YOU'RE GOING, DEFINE AMERICAN.
>> NO, NO, ACTUALLY IT'S THE
EXACT OPPOSITE.
IT'S THE ONE THAT TELLS US,
UNDOCUMENTED OR NOT, I GREW UP
HERE.
I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE I WAS 12.
I'M AN AMERICAN.
I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT KINDS OF
PAPERS.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
CONTRIBUTING, PAYING TAXES TO
THIS COUNTRY AND WHO DESERVE TO
BE PART OF THIS COUNTRY.
>> YOU'RE NOT AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
BECOME A CITIZEN OF OUR NATION?
>> WHAT WOULD THAT ENTAIL?
>> Stephen: OBVIOUSLY I'D HAVE
TO SWEAR YOU IN.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: RAISE YOUR RIGHT
HAND.
NOW RAISE YOUR LEFT HAND.
NOW GO TURN YOURSELF INTO THE
AUTHORITIES.
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
DEFINE AMERICAN FOUNDER JOSE
VARGAS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
