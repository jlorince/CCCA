NATION, WE'RE ALL STILL SADDENED
AND DISTURBED BY THE TRAGIC
SHOOTING IN TUCSON LAST
SATURDAY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE SOME
WHO ARE CYNICALLY EXPLOITING
THIS EVENT BY SUGGESTING THIS
MIGHT POSSIBLY BE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPLORE PERHAPS DISCUSSING
EVENTUALLY TONING DOWN OUR ANGRY
POLITICAL RHETORIC.
>> THOSE OF US IN PUBLIC LIFE
AND THE JOURNALISTS WHO COVER US
SHOULD BE THOUGHTFUL IN RESPONSE
TO THIS AND TRY TO BRING DOWN
THE RHETORIC.
>> WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS
HAVING A LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES
LOWERING THE LEVEL OF THE
RHETORIC.
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
FOR POLITICAL DISCOURSE IF
PEOPLE DIDN'T CALL EACH OTHER
FASCISTS AND SOCIALISTS AND
NAZIS AND HITLER.
>> AN ELOQUENT PLEA, BUT YOU
KNOW WHO ELSE WAS ELOQUENT?
HITLER.
( LAUGHTER )
LUCKILY I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE
DEFENDING OUR RIGHT TO RAGE.
AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOUTS, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT
OF ANGRINESS.
FOLKS, THE FORGOTTEN VICTIM IN
ALL OF THIS IS SARAH PALIN.
( LAUGHTER )
JUST BECAUSE LAST MARCH SHE PUT
OUT MAP OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE
GUNSIGHT CROSSHAIRS OVER 20
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,
INCLUDING GIFFORDS, BUT GRAPHICS
ARE NOT CALLS TO ACTION.
IF THEY WERE,'D STOP WHEN I SAW
ONE OF THESE THINGS.
IT'S JUST A METAPHOR.
( LAUGHTER )
BESIDES, ACCORDING TO PALIN'S
AID, REBECCA MANSOUR, THOSE
WEREN'T CROSSHAIRS.
>> WE NEVER INTENDED IT TO BE
GUNSIGHT.
IT'S A SURVEYOR'S SYMBOL.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY WERE
SURVEYOR'S SYMBOL, WHICH
EXPLAINS WHY THIS MAP COVERED
WITH SURVEYOR'S SYMBOLS WAS
IMMEDIATELY TAKEN DOWN FROM THE
PALIN WEB SITE, BECAUSE SARAH
PALIN KNOWS THAT NOW IS NOT THE
TIME TO DETERMINE GROUND
ELEVATION.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, THE FORMER GOVERNOR...
( APPLAUSE )
THE FORMER GOVERNOR RESPONDED TO
CRITICS TODAY IN HER ANNUAL
STATE OF MY LIVING ROOM ADDRESS.
>> THERE ARE THOSE WHO CLAIM
POLITICAL RHETORIC IS TO BLAME
FOR THE DESPICABLE ACT OF THIS
DERANGED APPARENTLY APOLITICAL
CRIMINAL.
JOURNALISTS AND PUNDITS SHOULD
NOT MANUFACTURE A BLOOD LIBEL
THAT SERVES ONLY TO INCITE THE
VERY HATRED AND VIOLENCE THAT
THEY PURPORT TO CONDEMN.
>> Stephen: SARAH PALIN KNOWS
ANGRY SPEECH ISN'T A CALL TO
VIOLENCE, UNLESS IT'S ANGRY
SPEECH DIRECTED AT SARAH PALIN
IN WHICH IT IS A CALL TO
VIOLENCE.
AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE
BRIEFLY GOVERNOR PALIN FOR DOING
HER PART TO NOT TONE DOWN THE
RHETORIC, BY USING THE
HISTORICAL TERM "BLOOD LIBEL,"
WHICH TRADITIONALLY REFERS TO
THE ACCUSATION THAT JEWS USED
CHRISTIAN BABY BLOOD IN THEIR
RITUALS.
FOR THE RECORD, JEWS DON'T USE
THE BLOOD OF CHRISTIAN BABIES.
OBAMACARE DOES.
THE POINT IS...
( APPLAUSE )
THE POINT IS, HOWEVER YOU FEEL
ABOUT PALIN'S MAP, THERE IS ZERO
EVIDENCE THAT THIS MENTALLY ILL
SHOOTER WAS INFLUENCED BY IT OR
ANY OTHER HEATED POLITICAL
RHETORIC LEFT OR RIGHT.
SO IF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
INCENDIARY RHETORIC HAS ANY
CONNECTION TO THIS UNSPEAKABLE
HORROR, IT LOGICALLY FOLLOWS
THAT IT MUST BE GOOD.
AFTER ALL, THERE IS NO TELLING
HOW MANY LIVES I'VE SAVED BY
YELLING "FIRE" IN A CROWDED
THEATER.
AND I AM NOT...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON... I AM
NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS
THE VALUE OF UPSETTING PEOPLE.
SO DOES GLENN BECK.
>> A HUSBAND, WHO HAS AN UNHAPPY
WIFE BECAUSE THE SISTER-IN-LAW
IS TALKING TO THE UNHAPPY WIFE.
YOU FIND OUT HE'S GOT A HOT
MISTRESS ON THE SIDE.
IS CONGRESS DOING SOMETHING TO
PISS OFF US, AND US IN TALK
RADIO AND FOX NEWS, WE'RE JUST
TELLING YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
THEY GOT A HOT MISTRESS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO LET
THAT ONE SINK IN.
SCHOLARS ARE GOING THE PARSE
THAT THING FOR CENTURIES.
THE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY IS THAT
WHEN THE SISTER-IN-LAW TELLS THE
WIFE ABOUT THE CHEATING, SHE HAS
TO DO IT AS LOUDLY AND AS
VICIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE
SOLE INTENT OF DESTROYING THE
MARRIAGE.
WHAT I ESPECIALLY...
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT I ESPECIALLY LIKE ABOUT
GLENN'S METAPHOR IS THAT WHEN
SOMEONE FINDS OUT A SPOUSE IS
CHEATING ON THEM, IT NEVER ENDS
VIOLENTLY.
( APPLAUSE )
BESIDES, SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER
IN MORE MEASURED TONES WOULD
VIOLATE OUR RIGHTS.
>> I TELL PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE
HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGRY AT
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO VOICE
THAT ANGER.
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE
PARTISAN IN ONE DIRECTION OR
ANOTHER.
>> IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO REIN IN
THE SPEECH OF CONSERVATIVES AND
REPUBLICANS AND ANYONE WHO
DISAGREES WITH THE LEFT.
>> I THINK WE SHOULD GO ON THE
ATTACK AGAINST THE LEFT FOR WHAT
THEY'RE DOING TO US.
>> NO ONE SHOULD BE DETERRED
FROM SPEAKING UP AND SPEAKING
OUT IN PEACEFUL DISSENT, AND WE
CERTAINLY MUST NOT BE DETERRED
BY THOSE WHO EMBRACE EVIL AND
CALL IT GOOD.
>> ARE YOU LISTENING,
TONE-IT-DOWN CROWD?
WE MUST NOT EMBRACE EVIL AND
CALL IT GOOD.
WE MUST EMBRACE THE GOOD OF
CALLING YOU EVIL.
AND, FOLKS, I SAY IF HEATED
RHETORIC IS GOOD, MORE OF IT IS
BETTER.
SO RATHER THAN LOWERING THE
RHETORICAL TEMPERATURE, WE NEED
TO ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE AND
CONSTANTLY DEMONIZE EACH OTHER,
AND IF THERE DOES COME A DAY
WHEN THE RHETORIC GETS SO
INTENSE AND SO SPECIFICALLY
THREATENING THAT SOMEONE TAKES
IT LITERALLY AND COMMITS A
TERRIBLE ACT THAT IS CLEARLY
BASED ON THREAT RICK, THEN AND
ONLY THEN PARTISANS ON BOTH
SIDES CAN DIAL IT BACK ONE
NOTCH.
BUT UNTIL THAT DAY, UNTIL THAT
DAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY
RIGHT TO BE ANGRY IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ANYONE ELSE'S
RIGHT TO NOT LIVE IN FEAR.
