EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PLEASE.
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
RIGHT OFF THE BAT, LET'S GET TO
THE NEWS THAT EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT, ME.
>> SANITY SWEEPING THROUGH
WASHINGTON.
>> JON STEWART AND STEPHEN
COLBERT ANNOUNCING YESTERDAY
THEY'RE HOLDING COMPETING
MARCHES ON THE NATIONAL MALL.
STEWART DUBBED HIS EVENT RALLY
TO RESTORE SANITY.
THEN NOT TO BE OUTDONE, STEPHEN
COLBERT CALLED ON ALL FREEDOM
LOVING PATRIOTS TO MARCH ON THE
SAME DAY AT THE SAME TIME FOR
HIS KEEP FEAR ALIVE RALLY.
>> JON STEWART AND STEPHEN
COLBERT ALSO WANT THE HARNESS
THE PUBLIC'S FRUSTRATION.
>> Stephen: NO SURPRISE, CNN
GOT IT WRONG.
JON WANTS TO HARNESS THE
PUBLIC'S FRUSTRATION.
I WANT TO BOMBARD THE PUBLIC'S
FRUSTRATION WITH GAMMA RAYS
UNTIL ITS TURNS ON ITS MASTER
WITH A LUST FOR BLOOD.
JON IS APPEALING THE REASON.
BUT AS I SAID BEFORE, REASON IS
JUST ONE LETTER AWAY FROM
TREASON.
NOW, REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD SAY
THAT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.
BUT THEY WOULD ALSO SAY THAT
YOUR DAUGHTER CAN'T GET PREGNANT
BY SWIMMING IN A PUBLIC POOLING.
DO YOU REALLY WANT THE TAKE THAT
CHANCE?
YOU SEE, FOLKS, I BELIEVE
AMERICA WAS FOUNDED ON THREE
PRINCIPLES, LIFE, LIBERTY AND
THE PURSUIT OF CRAP YOUR PANTS.
AND THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS WERE CLEARLY
MOTIVATED BY FEAR.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEIR HAIR WAS
WHITE?
MY GREATEST FEAR RIGHT NOW, ONE
THAT I'M SURE YOU ALL SHARE IS
THAT I'M NOT GETTING ENOUGH
ATTENTION.
LOOK AT THESE WEEKEND HEADLINES.
JON STEWART PLANS A RALLY.
JON STEWART HOLDS D.C. RALLY,

AGAINST EXTEACHISM.
STOP GIVING THIS GUY SO MUCH
ATTENTION.

STUDENT COLUMNIST ZACH KIN NARD
SAID, "STUDENT AND COLBERT
GATHERRERING MAY BE DEFINING
MOMENT OF A GENERATION."
HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, "I
