>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
NATION.
FOLKS, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU,
THE WORLD IS A VERY SCARY PLACE.
THAT'S WHY SOME NIGHTS I LIKE
THE REPORT HAPPY NEWS, WHICH
BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND
INSTALLMENT OF MY LONG-RUNNING,
100% TELEVISED SERIES "TINY
TRIUMPHS."
TONIGHT'S HEART-WARMING NEWS
COMES FROM THE HEART-STOPPING
WORLD OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
RECENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
WAS ALL SET TO CARRY OUT ITS
FIRST EXECUTION IN FIVE YEARS
WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THEIR
SUPPLY OF THE LETHAL DRUG SODIUM
THEO-PENTAL HAD EXPIRED ON
OCTOBER 1st.
EVIDENTLY THE BOTTLE HAD PASSED
ITS KILL-BY DATE.
( LAUGHTER )
THINGS ONLY GOT WORSE WHEN THEY
FOUND OUT THERE WAS NATIONWIDE
SHORTAGE OF SODIUM THEO-PENTAL.
I ASSUME CHINA BOUGHT IT ALL TO
PUT IN OUR TOOTHPASTE.
( LAUGHTER )
AFTER FRANTICALLY LOOKING
THROUGH THEIR CUPBOARDS AND
COUCH CUSHIONS AND COMING UP
EMPTY, CALIFORNIA HAD THE LOOK
ELSEWHERE.
>> CALIFORNIA PRISON OFFICIALS
TRIED FOR TWO MONTHS TO FIND THE
RARE LETHAL DRUG THEY NEEDED TO
CARRY OUT THE STATE'S FIRST
EXECUTION IN FIVE YEARS.
NEW DOCUMENTS SHOW OFFICIALS
SCOURED THE GLOBE FROM PAKISTAN
TO LONDON FOR THE DRUG.
>> MAKING IT THE FIRST TOUR OF
EUROPE AND ASIA LOOKING FOR
DRUGS THAT DID NOT FIND ANY.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW AS IT TURNS OUT, ENGLAND DID
HAVE SODIUM THEO-PENTAL, BUT THE
SHIPMENT WAS STOPPED AT THE
BORDER FOR INSPECTION BY THE
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
THERE ARE LIVES AT STAKE HERE.
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH
THAT DRUG, SOMEBODY COULD NOT
DIE.
( LAUGHTER )
LUCKILY JUST WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE
THIS STORY OF STATE-SPONSORED
EXECUTION WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPY
ENDING, CALIFORNIA GOT HELP FROM
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
ARIZONA AGREED TO LEND
CALIFORNIA A CUP OF DEATH.
NATION, IT'S THESE KIND OF
STORIES OF NEIGHBORS HELPING
NEIGHBORS THAT REALLY FILL YOUR
HEART WITH JOY.
OR IF YOU'RE ON DEATH ROW, 12
GRAMS OF SODIUM THEO-PENTAL.
DON'T THINK THAT ACT OF CHARITY
WENT UNAPPRECIATED.
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS UNDER SECRETARY
SCOTT KERNAN WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
TO SEND A THANK YOU E-MAIL,
WRITING, AND I QUOTE, "YOU GUYS
IN ARIZONA ARE LIFESAVERS."
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
SO BRAVO, ARIZONA.
YOU HAVE PROVE THAN THROUGH
TEAMWORK WE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE
TOGETHER TO THE 21st CENTURY,
