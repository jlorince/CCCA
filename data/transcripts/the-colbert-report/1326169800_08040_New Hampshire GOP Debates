THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, THANK YOU.
FOLKS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH
US.
NATION T IS THE EVE OF THE
NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY.
WHEN THE FOLKS IN VILLAGES
OF DIXVILLE NOTCH AND
FIDDLER'S CHRIS AND
PINKLER'S SACK EXERCISE
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
TONED THE PRIMARIES BEFORE
THE REST OF US CAN VOTE.
NOW THIS WEEKEND JUST TO
GREASE THE VOTING SKIDS, THE
REPUBLICANS HELD NOT ONE,
NOT ONE AGAIN, BUT TWO
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES.
THE PARTY KICKED OFF
SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE ABC
YAHOO! WMUR RED LOBSTER ALL
YOU CAN EAT OPINIONFEST.
NOW WHEN I WATCH ANY DEBATE
OBVIOUSLY I PLAY ONE OF
THOSE DRINKING GAMES.
BUT I KNEW THERE WERE TWO
DEBATES THIS WEEKEND SO TO
TAKE IT EASY, I TOOK A SHOT
ONLY WHEN SOMEONE SAID THE
WORD CONTRACEPTION.
>> CON TRACEPTION,
CONTRASENSE, CONTRACEPTION,
CONTRASENSE.
>> CONTRACEPTION.
>> CONTRACEPTION WITHIN
CONTRACEPTION.
>> BY THE END I WAS MORE
WASTED THAN A DONATION TO
THE HUTTSMAN CAMPAIGN.
(APPLAUSE)
NEEDLESS TO SAY-- NEEDLESS
TO SAY, I WAS A LITTLE
HUNGOVER.
I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY
THANKING JESUS, WHOSE
OPINIONS DID I AGREE WITH
LAST NIGHT.
BUT NOTHING CURES A DEBATE
HANG OVER LIKE A LITTLE HAIR
OF THE ELEPHANT THAT BIT
YOU.
LUCKILY NBC HAD A DEBATE THE
NEXT MORNING AT 9 A.M.
A GREAT CHANCE TO SEE HOW
MITT ROMNEY'S POSITIONS HAD
CHANGED OVER THE PAST TEN
HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I HAVE TO SAY, FOLKS, IN
BOTH DEBATES I WAS REALLY
IMPRESSED WITH RICK PERRY.
>> I THINK THAT YOU HAVE
TO-- I WOULD SEND TROOPS
BACK INTO IRAQ.
>> YES!
ABOUT DAMN TIME!
LET'S GET OUR TROOPS BACK
INTO IRAQ!
WE'VE BEEN FOR ALMOST TWO
WEEKS NOW.
PLENTY OF TIME FOR THOSE
BASTARDS TO GET WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION.
THE GOVERNOR PERRY KNOWS THE
GEO POLITICAL CHESS BEING
PLAYED HERE.
>> I THINK IT IS A HUGE
ERROR FOR US.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IRAN IN
MY OPINION, MOVE BACK IN AT
LITERALLY THE SPEED OF
LIGHT.
>> THE SPEED OF LIGHT.
NOT FIGURIVELY, LITERALLY.
I MEAN FORGET NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
(APPLAUSE)
SPEED OF LIGHT.
FOLKS, FORGET NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, IRAN HAS DEVELOPED
THE WARP DRIVE.
THOSE SEN RI-- CENTRIFUGES
WERE ACTUALLY ENRICHING
DILITHIUM CRYSTALS AND
UNLESS WE STOP THEM CAPTAIN
AHMADINEJAD WILL BE GETTING
