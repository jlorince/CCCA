THAT'S GOT TO HURT.
NATION, SEX.
NOW THAT YOU'RE PAYING
ATTENTION, GAY SEX.
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE TERRIFIED,
IT'S TIME FOR THE DEBUT OF MY
LONG-RUNNING SERIES STEPHEN
COLBERT'S BIG GAY ROUND-UP.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
FIRST UP IN THE GAY ROUND-UP...
[GUNFIRE]
[LAUGHTER]
THE MILITARY.
NATION, IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS
SINCE "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
WAS REPEALED, AND WATCHING LAST
WEEKEND'S WHITE HOUSE PRESS
BRIEFING, I LEARNED SOMETHING
SHOCKING FROM WORLD NET DAILY'S
LES KINSOLVING.
>> THERE WAS A 93-7 U.S. SENATE
VOTE TO APPROVE A DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION BILL THAT
"INCLUDES A PROVISION WHICH NOT
ONLY REPEALS THE MILITARY LAW ON
SODOMY BUT ALSO REPEALS THE
MILITARY BAN ON SEX WITH ANIMALS
OR BESTIALITY."
DOES THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF
BESTIALITY IN OUR ARMED FORCES?
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENT ON
THAT.
LET ME GO TO ANOTHER QUESTION.
>> LET'S GET TO SOMETHING MORE
SERIOUS.
>> Stephen: OH, WHAT COULD BE
MORE SERIOUS THAN THIS?
IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE KNOW
WHETHER OBAMA IS OPPOSED TO
BESTIALITY OR, LIKE ALL
DEMOCRATS, IS HE IN THE POCKET
OF BIG KANGAROO, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YOU SEE, AN EARLY VERSION OF THE
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
REPEALED THE RULE WHICH BANS GAY
SEX AND BESTIALITY.
AND CONSERVATIVES LIKE MICHELLE
BACKSTROM ARE BACHMANN.
FOLKS, I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU
WHAT THIS WOULD DO TO MORALE.
SAY A STAFF SERGEANT AND HIS
BOMB-SNIFFING DOG BEGIN TO HAVE
FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER.
AT FIRST THEY KEEP IT
PROFESSIONAL BUT SOON THEIR
NIGHTLY PATROLS ARE TURNING INTO
MOONLIT WALKS.
BEFORE LONG NO ONE ELSE IN THE
SQUAD WANTS TO BE IN THE SHOWER
WHEN THEY'RE SOAPING EACH OTHER
UP.
BECAUSE NOW IT SEEMS WEIRD.
NEXT UP, HOMOSEXUAL PENGUINS.
FOR YEARS... WHERE'S MY
BULLWHIP.
[WHIPPING NOISE]
THANK YOU.
LET'S BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR
THEME.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR YEARS I HAVE WARNED YOU
ABOUT THESE DEPRAVED AQUATIC
AVIANS.
FOR SIX YEARS NOW TWO MALE
PENGUINS NAMED HARRY AND PETTER
HAVE LIVED TOGETHER AS A NESTING
COUPLE AT THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO,
MAKING THEM THE SECOND GAYEST
BIRDS AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN.
NOW, FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST SAN
FRANCISCO NOW.
GAY PENGUINS HAVE APPEARED IN
GERMANY, CHINA AND TORONTO.
IT'S SO BAD THEY'VE EVEN
INSPIRED A HIT CHILDREN'S BOOK
"AND TANGO MAKES THREE," WHICH
PAVES THE WAY FOR SUCH SORDID
FUTURE TITLES LIKE "GOOD NIGHT
MORALS" AND "GREEN EGGS AND
DAN."
BUT FINALLY, FINALLY...
[APPLAUSE]
THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS ON THE
GAY PENGUIN FRONT.
JIM?
>> REMEMBER THE TORONTO ZOO'S
SO-CALLED GAY PENGUINS BUDDY AND
PEDRO?
REST LET'S SAW IT MAY HAVE BEEN
A PASSING PHASE.
THERE WAS AN UPROAR A FEW MONTHS
AGO WHEN THE ZOO ANNOUNCED THE
TWO MALE AFRICAN PENGUINS WOULD
BE SEPARATED.
BUDDY AND PEDRO WERE CONSIDERED
GAY G'DAY AS THEY PREFERRED TO
DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
IT TURNS OUT AFTER THEIR
BROMANCE BREAKUP, BOTH BUDDY AND
PEDRO HAVE TAKE ON THE FEMALE
MATES AND ACCORDING TO
ZOOKEEPERS ARE VERY INTERESTED
IN BREEDING.
>> THIS IS GREAT NEWS, NATION.
NOW WE KNOW THE CURE FOR
GAYNESS.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS SEPARATE
GAY MEN FROM THEIR PARTNERS.
PLACE THEM IN SECURE ENCLOSURES
WITH FEMALE PENGUIN.
HEY, I WOULDN'T KICK HER OUT OF
BED FOR EATING MACKEREL.
YEAH, GIRL, YOU WORK THOSE
VESTIGAL WINGS.
I'M GOING TO GET MY CRIMINAL UP
IN YOUR GRILL.
WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S MAN PENGUIN?
OH MY GOD.
THEN WHAT ARE THESE FEELINGS.
I KNOW I'M HUMAN STRAIGHT.
AM I PENGUIN GAY?
I MEAN, YES, I HAD UNEXPECTED
FEELINGS DURING "MARCH OF THE
PENGUINS," BUT I WROTE THOSE OFF
AS NATURAL RESPONSE TO MORGAN
FREEMAN'S NARRATION.
NO WONDER I BOOKED ELIJAH WOOD
TO TALK ABOUT HIS ROLE IN "HAPPY
FEET 2" AND WE HAD A SWORD
FIGHT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WIN THING IS
CLEAR.
WE MUST NOT INVADE ANTARCTICA.
FROM WHAT MICHELE BACHMANN SAYS,
I'M NOT SURE OUR TROOPS COULD
HANDLE THE TEMPTATIO
