(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS
HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW IMIMPROVE
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
TONIGHT SHE'LL BE SITTING AT THE
COOL KIDS' TABLE.
PLEASE WELCOME MELINDA GATES!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO NICE TO MEET YOU, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> GLAD TO.
>> Stephen: NOW THEN, MELINDA.
>> YES, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: AS YOU KNOW, YOU AND
I ARE THE SOLE MEMBERS OF THE
STEPHEN AND MELINDA GATES
FOUNDATION.
>> SO I HEAR.
>> Stephen: AND I'M NOT SEEN YOU
AS MANY OF THE BOARD MEETINGS.
>> HAVEN'T YOU BEEN E-MAILING
ME?
THAT'S HOW WE DO THESE THINGS.
>> Stephen: I HAVE AND I HAVE
BEEN GETTING CEASE AND DESIST
ORDERS FROM YOUR STAFF.
WE'LL GET TO THE MATTER OF YOUR
DUES LATER.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FIRST YOUR HUSBAND AND YOU
ARE THE LEADERS AND CREATORS OF
THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES
FOUNDATION.
AM I PRONOUNCING... BILL?
>> YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YOU HAVE MANY
GOALS, SOME OF WHICH ARE
ERADICATING MALARIA AND POLIO IN
AFRICA AND ALSO TO IMPROVE
EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS A GREATER
SDMAJ ERADICATING DISEASE OR
IMPROVING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING, WE
OFTEN TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
ERADICATING DISEASES IS REALLY,
REALLY DIFFICULT.
BUT I THINK THE THING THAT WE
WILL BE AT FOR A LIFETIME
BECAUSE IT IS SO HARD IS TRYING
TO IMPROVE THE U.S. PUBLIC
SCHOOL SYSTEM.
AND WE DO BOTH, THOUGH, BECAUSE
WE BELIEVE IN THE DEVELOPING
WORLD YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GROW
UP AND LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE AND
MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET THAT START
IN LIFE BUT IN THE U.S. PEOPLE
GENERALLY GROW UP TO LIVE A
HEALTHY LIFE BUT THEY NEED TO
HAVE A GREAT EDUCATION SYSTEM
AND WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT
EDUCATION SYSTEM TODAY, WE
REALLY DON'T.
>> Stephen: NOW, WHY NOT?
BECAUSE WE THROW A TON OF CASH
AT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM.
>> WE DO.
>> AND YOU GUYS-- AND I DON'T
MEAN TO BE CRASS-- HAVE EVEN
MORE CASH.
(LAUGHTER)
ARE YOU JUST THROWING GOOD MONEY
AFTER BAD HERE BY DONATING TO
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM?
>> WELL, THE U.S. STATES SPEND
ABOUT $500 BILLION EVERY SINGLE
YEAR ON THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
WE ARE PUTTING IN ABOUT $5
BILLION BASICALLY OVER THE NEXT
FEW YEARS.
BUT ALLñr PHILANTHROPIC MONEY CAN
DO IS BE A CATALYTIC WEDGE.
WE CAN LOOK AT THE PLACES WHERE
PEOPLE HAVEN'T ANSWERED THE
QUESTIONS OR ASKED SOME OF THE
QUESTIONS AND SAY WHAT IS IT WE
REALLY NEED TO DO TO FIX THIS?
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE
LEARNED IS THAT HAVING AN
EFFECTIVE TEACHER AT THE FRONT
OF THE CLASSROOM IS THE
SINGLE-MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT
WE CAN DO IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU FIGURE
THAT OUT BECAUSE...
(APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHO'S A
GOOD TEACHER AND WHO'S A BAD
TEACHER?
BECAUSE TEACHERS TEST BUT THEY
DON'T WANT TO BE TESTED.
>> YEAH, AND THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE ASK OURSELVES.
WE SAID HOW DO YOU KNOW WHETHER
THE TEACHER IS BEING EFFECTIVE
IN THE CLASSROOM AND SO WE GOT 3
TEACHERS SIGNED IN SIX DIFFERENT
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ALLOW US TO
VIDEOTAPE THEM AND TO START TO
TAKE....
>> Stephen: AT SCHOOL.
>> ATÑi
IN THE CLASSROOM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND WE STARTED TO LOOK AT
WHAT IS IT THAT THEY DA DO?
IF THEIR KIDS ARE DOING WELL ON
THE TEST AT THE END OF THE YEAR,
WHAT IS IT THEY'RE DOING IN THE
CLASSROOM?
WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN SOME
INTERESTING THINGS.
THE RESEARCH IS NOT FINISHED YET
BUT SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE
LEARNED IS THAT THEY MANAGE THE
CLASSROOM REALLY WELL.
THEY GET THE THINGS TO THINK
VERY CRITICALLY ABOUT THAT
ENGLISH ESSAY THEY'RE WRITING
AND IF THE KID DOESN'T EXPLAIN
IT THEY GO BACK UNTIL THE KID
DOES GET IT.
IF YOU MEASURE THE TEACHER ON A
MULTIPLE SET OF THINGS IT'S
PREDICTIVE OF WHETHER THAT KID
IS GOING TO DO WELL ON THAT
TEST.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE PLAN
GOING FORTH IN WISCONSIN RIGHT
NOW WHICH IS TO DECERTIFY THE
TEACHERS AND CUT THEIR BENEFITS.
DOES THAT HELP THE KIDS IN ANY
WAY?ñr
TER)(L
>> I THINK ACROSS THE MESH
SCHOOL SYSTEM, WE'RE SEEING EVEN
RIGHT TO WORK STATES ARE NOT
GETTING KIDS PREPARED AND
GETTING READY TO GO ON TO
COLLEGE SO WE NEED TO DO THINGS
TO SUPPORT THESE TEACHERS.
ONE OF THESE THINGS OVER 40
STATES HAVEÑi SIGNED UP TO DO IS
TO HAVE STANDARDS THAT SAY THIS
IS WHAT A KID NEEDS TO KNOW IN
ALGEBRA BY THE END OF NINTH
GRADE.
THIS IS WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART AND
ONCE YOU THAT YOU CAN OPEN UP
THE MARKET TO GET LOTS OF GREAT
CURRICULUM THAT ANY TEACHER THEN
CAN GO LOOK UP ON THE INTERNET
OR LOOK UP IN A BOOK TO CREATE
THEIR OWN CURRICULUM TO TEACH
KIDS IN CREATIVE WAYS.
>> Stephen: YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
HAVE PLEDGED TO GIVE AWAY 90% OF
YOUR WEALTH TO CHARITABLE
ENDEAVORS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT SOUNDS GOOD BUT HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE?
(LAUGHTER)
AND THEN THE TABLE ON A VERANDA
AND THER HAVE RABB DA ON THE
PENINSULA.
WHY AREN'T YOU LEAVING THINGS
FOR YOUR KIDS?
DON'T THEY DESERVE THE SAME LIFE
THAT YOU HAVE?
>> WELL, BILL AND I JUST REALLY
FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE
RESOURCES THAT HAVE COME FROM
MICROSOFT FROM WHAT THIS
CREATIVE WITH THAT COMPANY
SHOULD GO BACK TO SOCIETY.
WE FEEL LIKE WE BENEFITED SO
MUCH BY LIVING IN THE UNITED
STATES.
WE FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE THE
EDUCATION WE HAVE AND SO WE WANT
TO CHANGE THINGS IN THE UNITED
STATES AND IN SOME PLACES
OUTSIDE THE U.S.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE LOOEFG
YOUR CHILDREN ONLY 10% OF $60
BILLION!
GET OUT IN THE WORLD!
MAKE YOUR OWN WAY!
>> WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T PUT A
NUMBER ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
LEAVE THE KIDS.
>> Stephen: CAN I PUT A NUMBER
ON WHAT YOU COULD LEAVE HE?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT
MUST BE SUCH A BURDEN TO HAVE TO
GIVE THIS MONEY AWAY AND NOT
KNOW EXACTLY WHO TO GIVE IT TO.
YOU REMEMBER ANDREW CARNEGIE HE
GAVE AWAY ALL OF HIS MONEY?
REMEMBER ANDREW CARNEGIE?
HE GAVE AWAY ALL HIS MONEY AND
LOOK WHAT IT DID TO HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO
YOU, MELINDA GATES.
(APPLAUSE)
>> LET ME SAVE YOU FROM THAT!
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY.
I PROMISE SOMEONE WILL GET IT
EVENTUALLY.
PERSONALLY I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR SUPPORTING DONORS CHOOSE
BECAUSE I'M ON THE BOARD.
(APPLAUSE)
AND BESIDES THE HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLAR CHALLENGE YOU PUT OUT TO
MY FANS YOU HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING
DONORS CHOOSE FOR YEARS AND IT'S
A GREAT ORGANIZATION.
I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO GO ON
LINE, GO TOñr
