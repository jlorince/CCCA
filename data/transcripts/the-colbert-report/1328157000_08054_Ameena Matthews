>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS WORKING TO
END GANG VIOLENCE.
SHE SHOULD HAVE FIVE TEACH THEM
POETRY.
PLEASE WELCOME AMEENA MATTHEWS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
MISS MOOTS -- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING HERE.
I LOVE THOSE LIGHTNING BOLT
EARRINGS.
>> I WORE THEM JUST FOR YOU.
>> Stephen:  YOUNG LADY YOU'RE
WHAT'S CALLED A VIOLENCE
INTERRUPTER.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen:  FOR A GROUP
CALLED C-SPIRE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU'RE
FEATURED IN THE DOCUMENTARY
""THE INTERRUPTED"" WHICH WILL
BE ON FRONTLINE FEBRUARY 14 AT
9:00 P.M.
VIOLENCE INTERRUPTER.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  I'M AN
INTERRUPTER MYSELF.
BUT HOW DO YOU INTERRUPT
VIOLENCE?
THAT SOUND LIKE A VERY DANGEROUS
THING TO DO.
>> YES.
YOU ARE AN INTERRUPTER IN A RUDE
WAY.
I'M A VIOLENCE INTERRUPTER IN
SAVING LINES.
>> Stephen:  I SAVE OUR
NATION.
>> YEAH, WELL, I'VE SEEN YOU DO
IT.
( LAUGHTER ).
YES.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE WELCOME,
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
>> WE STOP THE TRANSMISSION OF
VIOLENCE FROM ONE PERSON TO
ANOTHER.
>> Stephen:  HOW DO YOU KNOW--
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN VIOLENCE IS
COMING?
>> THE COMMUNITY IS VERY, VERY
INFORMATIVE.
YOU KNOW, WHERE I WORK IS WHERE
I USED TO LIVE.
>> Stephen:  IN CHICAGO.
>> IT'S IN CHICAGO, ENGLEWOOD.
ENGLEWOOD IS-- PEOPLE THINK THAT
IT'S VIOLENT, BUT IT'S NOT.
IT'S JUST STRICKEN BY JUST
POVERTY AND LACK OF EDUCATION
AND LACK OF JOBS.
BUT WHEN WE HEAR OF VIOLENCE--
AND SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE DRIVING
DOWN THE STREET THINGS JUMP OFF,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
DOCUMENTARY, WHEN IT FIRST
STARTED THERE WAS A FIGHT, AND
WE JUST GET RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT BECAUSE MY GOAL IS TO SAVE
A LIFE AND TO BE PROACTIVE AND
NOT REACTIVE.
>> Stephen:  SO LET'S TAKE A
LOOK AT YOU DOING SOME VIOLENCE
INTERRUPTION.
JIM.
>> AND ALL OF IT IS STUPID.
ALL OF IT IS STUPID.
2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THESE
BABIES ARE COMING HOME FROM
SCHOOL AND Y'ALL SHOOTING.
FOR REAL?
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ME TO
BE HOLDING THIS BOY, THIS YOUNG
MAN'S OBITUARY.
SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, YOUR MAMA'S
HOUSE, YOUR CARS-- THOSE ARE
SAFE ZONES.
I WAS MAKE SOMETHING REAL STUPID
DECISIONS AND SOME STUPID CALLS.
IT WAS ME, MY LIFE, BLOOD ON MY
HANDS, IN MY HEAD.
STOP.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  SO WHY-- WHY ARE
THOSE YOUNG MEN LISTENING TO
YOU?
>> BECAUSE I'M CONSIDERED A
CREDIBLE MESSENGER.
>> Stephen:  WHY?
>> I'VE BEEN THERE AND I'VE DONE
THAT.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN OUT THERE ON
THE STREETS OF CHICAGO.
>> Stephen:  YOUR DAD IS THE
FOUNDER OF THE AL RUBEINS, MAJOR
GANG FIGURE IN CHICAGO.
DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY CRED WITH
THESE PEOPLE?
>> YEAH, THAT GIVES ME A LITTLE
BIT.
THAT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT.
BUT I WAS OUT THERE DOING MY OWN
THING.
I MADE MY OWN NAME ON THE STREET
SO I FIGURED SINCE I GOT OUT,
EXPOSURE, I KNOW BETTER, I HAVE
DONE BETTER, THEN I CAN TAKE IT
BACK TO MY GUYS AND GIRLS AND
LET THEM KNOW.
>> Stephen:  SO WHY DOES
SOMEBODY JOIN A GANG?
>> WELL, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS,
STEPHEN.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF WHAT'S
GOING ON AT HOME.
YOU KNOW, THEY MAY FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE NOT GETTING THAT TYPE OF
LOVE OR THE ATTENTION.
HOMES ARE BROKEN.
THERE MAY BE A FARTHER IN A
PENITENTIARIRY, A MOTHER IN A
PENITENTIARIRY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE
ISSUES, BEING RAISED BY THEIR
GRANDPARENTS, WHATEVER.
SO THEY FEEL LIKE THE DISCONNECT
IS THERE.
SO WHEN THEY GO OUT ON THE
STREET AND SEE SOMEBODY TO SAY,
"HEY, LOOK, YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO EAT?
YOU WANT SOME GYM SHOES?
YOU WANT SOME MONEY?"
THAT'S APPEALING TO THEM.
>> Stephen:  I WANT ALL OF
THOSE THINGS.
I'M NOT EVEN IN A GANG AND I
WANT THOSE THINGS.
YOU WERE LECTURING THOSE GUYS
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHAT YOU HAD
DONE AS A CHILD.
>> I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH THEM.
I WASN'T LECTURING.
>> Stephen:  YOU WEREN'T.
>> NOT AT ALL.
JUST LETTING THEM KNOW --
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT SAYING
HEY, GUYS LET'S PUT THE ANGER ON
THE BACK BURNER AND SETTLE THIS
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.
YOU'RE BEING TOUGH WITH THESE
GUYS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU MENTIONED MY DAD AND YOU
MENTIONED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT, BUT
BACK IN THE DAY IT WAS ABSURD TO
SHOOT AT 2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON
WHEN KIDS ARE COMING HOME FROM
SCHOOL, OR SHOOTING AT A CAR
WHERE YOUR MOM WAS IN.
I WAS EDUCATING THOSE GUYS.
>> Stephen:  SO ARE YOU
ACTUALLY SAYING IN THERE, LIKE,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS, DO
IT, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU SHOULD
BE SHOOTING EACH OTHER?
>> NO, I WAS SAYING DON'T DO IT
AT ALL.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, OKAY.
>> AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT AT ALL.
>> Stephen:  DID THAT STOP?
>> IT STOPPED.
>> Stephen:  HOW WOULD YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?
IS THERE A BAT SIGNAL?
>> COMMUNICATION.
I'M ALWAYS --
>> Stephen:  YOUR SPIDER
SENSES WERE TINGLING.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> Stephen:  COME ON!
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WHEN YOU'RE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE
I'M FROM AND YOU SEE ON A DAILY
BASIS KIDS ARE OUTSIDE, THEY'RE
RIDING THEIR BIKES, THE GUYS ARE
PLAYING BASKETBALL WITH A MILK
CRATE, AND THEN YOU DRIVE
THROUGH THERE THE NEXT HOUR, AND
NOBODY'S THERE.
THEN YOUR SENSE GOES UP AND SAY
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING
JUMPING OFF PRETTY SOON.
LET ME FIND OUT.
LET ME SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
LET ME GET OUT AND ASK
QUESTIONS.
AND NINE TIME-- 10 TIMES OUT OF
10 I GET THOSE QUESTIONS
ANSWERED.
>> Stephen:  YOU CALLED
VIOLENCE A DISEASE.
>> IT IS.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED
WORKING WITH THE PROJECT, I
DIDN'T THINK ABOUT VIOLENCE
BEING A DISEASE.
I THOUGHT ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER
TAUGHT ME THAT IF SOMEONE HITS
YOU, YOU HIT THEM BACK.
THAT MEANS PROTECTING YOURSELF.
BUT WHAT IT DID WAS, BY ME
HAVING A BIG FAMILY AND THE
OTHER PERSON HAVING A BIG
FAMILY, IF I HIT THAT PERSON
BACK AND THEY HIT ME BACK,
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR CRAZY
COUSIN, THEIR BIG MAMA, THEIR
AUNT, THEIR UNCLE --
>> Stephen:  BIG MAMA.
>> I WAS TOLD IF SOMEONE HITS
YOU, HIT THEM BACK.
BUT THEN IF I HIT THEM BACK AND
A PERSON HITS ME BACK, I'VE GOT
A FAMILY THAT WANTS TO PROTECT
ME.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S HOW THE
DISEASE SPREADS?
>> IT SPREADS LIKE DIRTY WATER.
I GET IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE LIKE AN
ANTIBODY.
>> I'M LIKE AN ANTIBODY.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE LIKE-- IF
YOU'LL PARDON THE EXPRESSION-- A
WHITE BLOOD CELL.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I'M A
PAPER SACK BROWN BLOOD CELL.
( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, HAPPY
BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
