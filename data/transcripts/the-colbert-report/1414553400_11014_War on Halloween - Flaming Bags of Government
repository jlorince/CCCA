(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN!
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING HERE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND
THE WORLD, MR. AND MRS. AMERICAAND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA
NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORBEING HERE!
FOLKS, IF YOU CHECK YOURCALENDAR, I HOPE YOU DO, EVERY
DAY, NATION, WE ARE JUST A FEWDAYS AWAY FROM THE MOST HALLOWED
OF ALL EENS, HALLOWEEN.
(LAUGHTER)I'M SO GOOD AT TRICK OR
TREATING.
PRO TIP:  CUT OUT THE MIDDLEMAN, GO STRAIGHT TO THE DRUG
STORE, BUY YOUR CANDY.
NOVEMBER 1, IT'S USUALLY ONSALE.
SO I WILL MONSTER MASH ANYONEOUT THERE WHO THREATENS
THIS SACRED PAGAN HOLIDAY.
THIS IS THE WAR ON HALLOWEEN.
(WIND BLOWING, KNOCKING,SCREAMING)
FOLKS, WHEN I'M LOOKING FORPEOPLE ASSAULTING OUR
TRADITIONAL HALLOWEEN VALUES,THE FIRST PLACE I TURN IS
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WEBSITES.
AND I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED ATHOW DISAPPOINTED I AM.
FOR INSTANCE, THIS YEAR, UNCLESAM IS GOING AFTER MY FAVORITE
PART OF HALLOWEEN:  CARVING THEPUMPKIN.
DRIVING A 12-INCH CHEF'S KNIFEINTO A TOUGH-YET-SLIPPERY GOURD
HIDE IS A GREAT WAY TO GET RIDOF ANY EXCESS THUMBS YOU'VE GOT
LAYING AROUND YOUR HAND.
BUT JUST LISTEN TO HOW BIGGOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CARVE
ITS OWN AGENDA.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION WANTS YOU TO DO,
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OFENERGY?
THIS HALLOWEEN, RATHER THANCARVE OUT SOMETHING SCARY OR A
JACK-O'-LANTERN IN THE FACE OFTHAT $45 PUMPKIN YOU BUY, WHY
DON'T YOU DO ONE OF FIVE GREENENERGY DESIGNS LIKE THE C.F.L.
LIGHT BULB OR A WINDMILL OR SOMELEAVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
ISN'T THAT A GREAT IDEA?
>> Stephen: NO, IT'S NOT AGREAT IDEA.
IT'S NOT.
THE GLOBAL WARMING AGENDA HAS NOPLACE IN OUR SPOOKY-TIME FUN.
WE DON'T KNOW IF CLIMATE CHANGEIS MANMADE.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IFFRANKENSTEIN IS MANMADE.
THE MAD SCIENCE ISN'T IN YET!
BESIDES, THE WHOLE REASON WECARVE PUMPKINS ON HALLOWEEN IS
TO PROVE OUR DOMINANCE OVERNATURE.
THAT'S WHY WE STAB A PUMPKIN INTHE FACE AND THEN DISPLAY IT ON
OUR FRONT PORCHES AS A WARNINGTO THE OTHER VEGETABLES.
HERE'S A MESSAGE FOR YOURBUDDIES BACK ON THE FARM!
YOU TELL THAT SQUASH I'M COMINGFOR HIM WITH NUTMEG AND CHICKEN
STOCK!
I WILL MAKE HIS LIFE A LIVINGSOUP!
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY FLAMINGBAG OF GOVERNMENT THEY'RE
LEAVING ON OUR FRONT PORCH.EVIDENTLY,
THE FDA'S WEBSITE DEMANDS THAT,BEFORE GOING BOBBING FOR APPLES,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REDUCE THENUMBER OF BACTERIA THAT MIGHT
BE PRESENT ON APPLES BYTHOROUGHLY RINSING THEM UNDER
COOL RUNNING WATER. GREAT TIP.
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SUREYOUR APPLES ARE SPARKLINGLY
CLEAN BEFORE DROPPING THEM INTOA LUKEWARM CESSPOOL OF TODDLER
TODDLER SNOT.
THAT'S WHY I CALL IT "BOBBINGFOR PINK EYE"
HUGE CONJUNCTIVITUS FANS HERETONIGHT.
AND THE NANNY STATE GOONS WON'TEVEN LET US ENJOY OUR SWEET
MEATS BECAUSE MANY HALLOWEENCANDIES CONTAIN PALM OIL, AND
THE THUGS AT THE DEPARTMENTOF FISH AND WILDLIFE ARE
NOW DEMANDING THAT WE READ OURLABELS!
PALM OIL PLANTATIONS ARECONTRIBUTING TO ANIMAL HABITAT
LOSS AROUND THE WORLD.
OH, I HAVE SUCH HAPPY CHILDHOODMEMORIES OF RUSHING HOME TO
"READ" MY CANDY.
BESIDES, THE BEST PART OF CANDYIS HARM TO ANIMAL HABITATS
AND CANDY COMPANIES KNOW THIS,THAT'S WHY THEY PROMOTE THEIR
INGREDIENTS RIGHT ON THE LABEL.
FOR PETE'S SAKE, KIT KATS  AREMADE FROM GROUND-UP KITTENS, AND
KATTENS.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: DELICIOUS!
CRUNCHY!
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CRUNCHY!
