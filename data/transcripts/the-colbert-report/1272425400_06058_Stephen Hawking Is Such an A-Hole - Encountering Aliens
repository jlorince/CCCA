THANK YOU.
FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO ASTRO PHYSICIST STEPHEN HAWKING, I'VE NEVER BOUGHT THE HYPE.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, TAKE HIS SEMINOLE WORK,
"A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME." MY FEELINGS ARE BEST SUMMED UP
BY MY OWN BOOK, "A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TIME I TRIED TO READ 'A
BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME'." CHAPTER ONE, BOR-ING.
LUCASIAN CHAIR, PLEASE.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT INSTALLMENT OF MY LONG-RUNNING SERIES, "STEPHEN HAWKING IS SUCH
AN A-HOLE."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOYAL VIEWERS WILL RECALL MY LAST INSTALLMENT FROM JUNE 2006.
HAWKING'S SUCH AN A-HOLE.
[APPLAUSE]
AND FOR THAT I WON MY PEABODY.
WELL, NOW THIS HUBBLE HUMPER IS BACK WITH A NEW TV SERIES, "INTO THE UNIVERSE WITH STEPHEN
HAWKING," AND HERE, HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PROSPECT
OF MANKIND ENCOUNTERING ALIENS.
>> THE OUTCOME WOULD BE MUCH AS WHEN CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS FIRST
LANDED IN AMERICA, WHICH DIDN'T TURN OUT VERY WELL FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: FIRST OF ALL,
WHERE'S HE EVEN FROM?
[LAUGHTER]
I CAN'T PLACE THAT ACCENT.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY DO THE ALIENS GET TO BE COLUMBUS IN THIS SCENARIO?
I THINK WE HUMANS HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF RAPING AND PILLAGING.
IT'S RIGHT THERE ON MAN KIND'S RESUME: 50 WORDS PER MINUTE,
PILLAGING, SMALLPOX.
IF YOU STILL NEED A REFERENCE,
ASK ANY NEANDERTHAL.
OH, WAIT, YOU CAN'T.
WE KILLED AND ATE THEM.
SAY FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT WHATEVER IS OUT THERE IS RUTHLESS ENOUGH TO CONQUER ALL
OF HUMANITY WITH A SINGLE PHOTON BURST FROM THE MOTHER QUEEN'S LASER GLAND, WHATEVER, HAWKING
IS STILL WITH THIS STATEMENT PUSHING THE OLD LIBERAL MYTH THAT COLONIZATION WAS BAD FOR
THE NATIVE AMERICANS.
EXCUSE ME, I SEEM TO REMEMBER WE BROUGHT THEM CHRISTIANITY.
AND MAYBE, MAYBE THE ALIENS HAVE SOME SORT OF SPACE JESUS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, YOU'LL NOTICE EVEN IN SPACE, JESUS IS WHITE.
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS WITHOUT COLUMBUS AND THE INVASION OF THE WHITE MAN,
NATIVE AMERICANS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL MUSICIANS, WISE
SPIRIT GUIDE OR SMOKING HOT ANIMATED PRINCESSES WHO SPEAK TO RACK COONS, NOT TO MENTION,
THERE WOULD BE ONE LESS SLUTTY HALLOWEEN COSTUME.
PERSONALLY I LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE AFTER THE ALIENS HAVE CONQUERED US WHEN ON BASEBALL'S
OPENING DAY THE CLEVELAND HUMANS TAKE THE FIELD.
BRING OUT THE MASCOT, BOYS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
♪♪ SEE.
YOU SEE, STEPHEN HAWKING, IT IS NOT... IT IS NOT THE DOOM OF OUR SPECIES.
IT IS THE DOOM OF OUR SPECIES WITH A T-SHIRT CANNON.
SO IN SUMMATION, FOR SUGGESTING THAT ALIENS ENSLAVING US WOULD BE A BAD THING, STEPHEN HAWKING
IS SUCH AN A-HOLE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HIT IT.
