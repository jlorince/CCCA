APPLAUSE]>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I TRY TO KEEP THINGS LIGHT AROUND HERE, BUT AS A NEWSMAN IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO BRING YOU THE UGLY TRUTHS ABOUT OUR WORLD.
BRACE YOURSELVES: IT CONTAINS OTHER COUNTRIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS UNAMERICAN NEWS.
♪ ♪ THAT IS THE RELUCTANT SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE I BELIEVE OTHER COUNTRIES DESERVE.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LAST YEAR'S EGPYTIAN REVOLUTION IS NOW ENTERING ITS SIXTEENTH MONTH.
THAT'S KIND OF A LONG ARAB SPRING-- WHICH OF COURSE WAS PREDICTED BY THE ARAB PUNXATAWNY
PHIL ALEXANDRIA ALI.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S THE LEADER OF AN UNDERGROUND EXTREMIST WEATHER-PREDICTING SECT, THE MARMOT BROTHERHOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE POPPED UP, SAW HIS SHADOW,
AND WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN OUT BY A PREDATOR DRONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, I'VE BEEN PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.
WHAT KIND OF DEMOCRACY WILL EMERGE?
THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING IS OVER, AND FROM AN INITIAL FIELD OF 13 CANDIDATES, EGYPTIAN
VOTERS NARROWED IT DOWN TO TWO PROMISING CONTENDERS: FROM THE CONSERVATIVE MOHAMMED MORSI --
NO RELATION TO MORRISSEY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S A MEMBER OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, WHICH IS KINDA LIKE THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELLING
PANTS, ONLY THEY DON'T ALLOW THEIR SISTERS TO TRAVEL, OR WEAR PANTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S FACING OFF AGAINST SECULAR FORMER MILITARY OFFICER AND PRIME MINISTER UNDER HOSNI
MUBARAK, AHMED SHAFIQ, WHO PROMISES TO "RESTORE SECURITY WITH AN IRON FIST."
WHICH IS WHY, IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT FOR HIM IN EGYPT, HE COULD RUN FOR OFFICE IN ARIZONA.
AFTER ALL IT'S A DESERT, AND THEY'VE ALREADY BEGUN MUMMIFYING THEIR CURRENT RULER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
EGYPTIANS ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT THESE CANDIDATES, THEY'RE TAKING TO THE STREETS!
>> IN TAHRIR SQUARE LAST NIGHT THOUSANDS OF YOUNG REVOLUTIONARIES CAME OUT TO PROTEST.
THEY SAID THEY DO NOT LIKE AHMED SHAFIQ, THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE MUBARAK REGIME.
AND AT THE SAME  TIME THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WHO IS GOING TO BASE
THE EGYPTIAN STATE ON ISLAMIC LAW.
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE ALREADY CHANTING, "DOWN WITH THE NEXT PRESIDENT."
>> Stephen: YES, DOWN WITH THE NEXT PRESIDENT!
HEY HEY! HO HO! TBD HAS GOT TO GO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS MAY LOOK BAD, BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
LOOK AT THE FACTS: NOBODY LIKES EITHER CANDIDATE, ANGRY PROTESTERS ARE SCREAMING IN THE
STREETS, AND ONLY 46% OF REGISTERED VOTERS WENT TO THE POLLS.
WHICH MEANS EGYPT HAS FINALLY ACHIEVED AMERICAN-STYLE DEMOCRACY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
FORK AMERICA!
-- FOR AMERICA!
BECAUSE DEMOCRACY ISN'T ABOUT GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT!
IT'S ABOUT NOT GETTING MOST OF WHAT YOU DON'T WANT!
EGYPTIANS UNDERSTAND THIS.
LOOK AT THE SPHINX.
THAT WAS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN VOTERS WHO OPPOSED A GIANT STATUE OF A MAN AND VOTERS WHO
OPPOSED A GIANT STATUE OF A CAT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHAT WE AMERICANS ARE GOING TO DO THIS FALL.
IN NOVEMBER, WE'LL GO TO THE POLLS, HOLD OUR NOSE AND PULL THE LEVER FOR THE GUY WE HATE
THE LEAST.
ROMNEY 2012!
WAIT.
WAIT.
WHAT IF WE PUT HIM ON A CAT BODY?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
