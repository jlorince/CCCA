( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT
CRAYONS ARE A LOT LIKE PEOPLE--
THEY MAY COME IN DIFFERENT
COLORS, BUT INSIDE, THEY'RE ALL
THE SAME FLAVOR.
( LAUGHTER )
AND WE WOULD NOT HAVE CRAYONS IF
IT WERE NOT FOR THE CRAYOLA
COMPANY OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA,
WHICH IS IN THE SUBJECT OF THE
68th INSTALLMENT OF MY
434-PART SERIES "BETTER KNOW A
DISTRICT."
TONIGHT, THE FIGHTIN' 17th.
THE 17th IS HOME TO THE
OLDEST BREWERY IN THE UNITED
STATES, YUENGLING, WHOSE NAME IS
ANANG LISIZED VERSION OF THE
GERMAN WORD JUNGLING, WHICH
MEANS YOUNG BOY.
BUT IF YOU'RE EVER IN A BAR AND
THEY OFFER YOU A YOUNG BOY,
PLEASE ALERT AUTHORITIES
IMMEDIATELY.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE )
NOW THE 17th WAS ONCE HOME
TO PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY WHO
CUT HIS TEETH AS A REPORTER FOR
NEPWILLS-BARRY-SCRONTON.
IT IS THERE WHERE HE TESTED OUT
THE NO SPIN ZONE, THE STAY STILL
SPOT AND LACK OF ROTATION AREA.
AND JUST WHO HAS THE SCRAP TOLL
REPRESENT THIS CORNER OF
PENNSYLVANIA, IT'S NONE OTHER
THAN FIRST TERM CONGRESSMAN MATT
CARTWRIGHT.
I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE
CARTWRIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.
CONGRESSMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> MY PLEASURE.
I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  WELL, THE FEELING
IS MUTUAL?
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  I MEAN ABOUT ME.
>> YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF YOURSELF.
>> Stephen:  I AM.
>> YOU SHOULD BE.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, THANK YOU.
I THINK WE MIGHT BE DONE.
WE HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS,
OKAY.
MY APOLOGIES.
I GOT WHAT I NEEDED.
( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY, I STILL HAVE TO ASK SOME
QUESTIONS.
CONGRESSMAN, TELL ME ABOUT THE
FIGHTIN' 17th.
>> WELL, THE FIGHTIN' 17th
IS THE NEW DISTRICT IN
NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA.
IT'S COMPOSED OF SCRANTON,
WILKES-BARRE.
>> THE CRAYOLA COMPANY IS IN
YOUR DISTRICT, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT, THAT'S DOWN IN EASTON.
>> Stephen:  HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT RECENT PLANS TO RENAME THE
WHITE CRAYON REPUBLICAN?
>> I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT.
>> Stephen:  DO NOT AGREE WITH
THAT.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO
IMMIGRATION, YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE
TO TURN UNDOIMENTED WORKERS INTO
TAXPAYERS.
>> I THINK I AGREE WITH THE
PRESIDENT'S APPROACH THAT WE
HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH BUT FAIR
PROCESS TO, THE PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP.
>> Stephen:  LET'S CALL IT
AMNESTY, SHAM-NESTY AS I CALL
IT.
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S
APPROACH IS THE RIGHT ONE.
WE'RE NOT ABOUT TO DEPORT 11
MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.
THEY'RE DOING JOBS THAT NOBODY
ELSE WANTS TO DO.
>> Stephen:  LIKE WHAT?
>> LIKE TRANSIENT FARM WORKING
JOBS.
>> I DON'T CARE WHAT SEX THEY
ARE AS LONG AS THEY PICK OUR
VEGETABLES.
>> TRANSIENT FARM WORKERS ARE
PEOPLE WHO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE
TO THE NEXT.
>> Stephen:  RIGHT, BECAUSE NO
ONE WANTS A TRANSIENT.
I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
PICK VEGETABLES.
>> TRANSIENT FARM WORKERS DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE--
WITH TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.
>> Stephen:  ANOTHER MY
APOLOGIES.
MY APOLOGIES TO MEXICANS.
( LAUGHTER )
SPEAKING OF WHICH, THE HISPANIC
VOTE WAS KEY TO THE DEMOCRATIC
VICTORY IN 2012, TRUE?
>> I THINK SO.
>> Stephen:  HOW DID YOU
PANDER TO THOSE VOTERS?
( LAUGHTER )
IN ESPANOL?
>> I'M AFRAID MY SPAN SISH QUITE
POOR.
>> Stephen:  LET ME HELP YOU
OUT TO APPEAL TO FANNISH VOTERS
JUST REPEAT AFTER ME.
I CARUMBA.
JUST SAY, HEY, YOU GUYS.
EYE CARUMBA.
>> ICARUMBA.
>> SALIR.
>> SAL IR.
>> Stephen:  ME BARRIO.
BARRIO.ME
>> Stephen:  REPUBLICANS WOULD
NEVER SAY THAT TO YOU BECAUSE
THEY DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH?
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, A FELLOW ROMAN CATHOLIC?
>> YES.
>> UP HERE, RIGHT UP HERE.
BOOM.
ONE TRUE BRIDE OF CHRIST, RIGHT?
>> SURE YOU.
>> Stephen:  CAN'T SAY THAT
WHEN PROTESTANTS ARE AROUND.
IT'S SO SAD THEY'RE GOING TO
HELL AND WE'RE NOT, ISN'T IT?
I'LL MISS THEM.
THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD ONES.
>> Stephen:  YUP.
I SALUTE YOU FOR PUTTING THE
TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH ABOVE
POLITICS.
SO FEW DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO
DO THAT.
DOES IT CAUSE TROUBLE WITH THE
REST OF THE DEMOCRAT THALZ YOU
OPPOSE BIRTH CONTROL AND ARE
OPPOSED TO HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGE?
>> I AM A SUPPORTER OF MARRIAGE
ECOMMONWEALTH.
>> Stephen:  I BELIEVE ALL
MARRIAGES SHOULD BE EQUAL.
EVERY LEGITIMATE MARRIAGE
SHOULD, THAT'S A MAN AND A
WOMAN.
NO ONE'S MARRIAGE IS BETTER THAN
OTHERS.
MINE IS-- MINE IS ACTUALLY
BETTER, BUT LEGALLY, NO ONE'S
MARRIAGE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN
OTHERS AS LONG AS IT IS A
LEGITIMATE MARRIAGE.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
MARRIAGE IS BETTER THAN MINE.
MY WIFE, MARION, AND I HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR 27 YEARS.
AND WE BOTH SUPPORT MARRIAGE
EQUALITY FOR THE
L.G.B.T. POPULATION.
THERE'S NO REASON TO
DISCRIMINATE.
>> Stephen:  THE WHO?
WHAT'S THE L.G.B.T.?
>> LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.
>> SO YOU WANT LESBIANS, GAYS,
BISEXUALS, AND THOSE TRANSIENTS
WHO PICK MY VEGETABLES.
GAY PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN.
THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS TO
HAVE CHILDREN.
GAY PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN.
YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?
YOU BE HOW BABIES ARE MADE?
( LAUGHTER )
>> THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT
PEOPLE --
>> Stephen:  I HAVE TO GET TO
THE FIRST QUESTION.
YOU KNOW HOW BABIES ARE MADE.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAG.
>> I'M AWARE OF HOW BABIES ARE
MADE.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU KNOW GAY
PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT NOT MUCH OF
AN ARGUMENT WHEN ST. PETER
JUDGES YOU AT THE GATES UPON
HEAVEN.  "HEY, YOU WERE AGAINST
THE LAW OF GOD."
WHAT!
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S MOVE ON.
DO YOU REMEMBER SEVERAL
CAUCUSES, INCLUDING THE
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,
TRUE?
>> I DON'T THINK I AM IN THAT
ONE.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT IN THE
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS?
>> I DON'T THINK I AM.
>> Stephen:  IT SAYS HERE ARE
YOU-- OH, I'M SORRY, THE BIKE
CAUCUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY RODE BIKES.
ANYWAY, OKAY.
( LAUGHTER ).
OH, THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
I NEVER LEARNED TO RIDE A BIKE.
>> OOOH!
>> Stephen:  NEVER LEARNED.
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO RIDE A BIKE?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen:  WOULD YOU BE
WILLING TO TEACH ME?
>> I COULD DO THAT.
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
>> Stephen:  LET'S GO, OKAY,
OKAY.
>> ARE YOU READY?
>> Stephen:  I GOT IT, I GOT
IT, I GOT IT.
I'M DOING IT!
I'M DOING IT!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I DID IT.
I DID IT.
LET'S PUT PENNSYLVANIA 17th
UP ON THE BIG BOARD!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I HOPE THAT DISTRICT JUST
TWINKLED OR I THINK I'VE GOT A
CONCUSSION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
