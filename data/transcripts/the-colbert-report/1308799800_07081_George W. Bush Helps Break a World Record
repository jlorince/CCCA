[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,
EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I WOULD CALL YOU NATION BUT
BASED ON THAT CLAPPING --
RHYTHM NATION, IT'S THE THIRD
NIGHT OF MY SUMMER CONCERT
SERIES AND I AM READY TO ROCK
OUT WITH MY SOCK OUT-- AND YOU
KNOW WHAT'S IN MY SOCK.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO TONIGHT'S
JAM-SPLOSION, REGULAR VIEWERS
KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF
GEORGE W. BUSH.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU CAN CHECK THE TAPE.
JIMMY, WE'VE DESTROYED THE TAPE,
RIGHT?
>> YEP!
>> Stephen: GOOD.
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, HE HAS MADE
THE MOST OF HIS POST-PRESIDENCY.
LAST NIGHT AT A TEXAS RANGERS
GAME, PRESIDENT BUSH MADE HIS
GREATEST CONTRIBUTION YET.
HE HELPED BREAK THE GUINNESS
WORLD RECORD FOR MOST PEOPLE
WEARING SUNGLASSES IN THE DARK!
HE DID IT!
AMERICA'S BACK!
IF YOU'RE KEEPING TRACK, THE
U.S. NOW HOLDS THE RECORD FOR
MOST SUNGLASSES IN THE DARK,
HIGHEST INTAKE OF COOL-RANCH
FLAVORING,
AND MOST tV SHOWS ABOUT
HOARDING.
WHY AREN'T MORE EX-PRESIDENT'S
STRIVING FOR RECORD-BREAKING
EXCELLENCE?
WHY'S JIMMY CARTER BUILDING
HOUSES FOR THE POOR WHEN HE
COULD BE GROWING THE WORLD'S
LONGEST FINGERNAILS?
PRESIDENT BUSH IS FOLLOWING IN
THE NOBLE TRADITION OF
PRESIDENTS LIKE RICHARD NIXON,
WHO STILL HOLDS THE GUINNESS
RECORD FOR MOST ANTI-SEMITIC
SLURS PER MINUTE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT, WHO
WENT ON TO BE ONE OF THOSE
FAT TWINS ON MOPEDS.
SO BRAVO, PRESIDENT BUSH
