(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH
GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTOOKNO PLACE TO HIDE.
OKAY, WHAT ELSE IS IN THISBOOK.
YOU'VE GOT NEW REVELATIONSIN THIS BOOK.
WHAT ARE SO THINGS THAT WEDIDN'T KNOW THAT ARE
SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO SHOCK MYCONSCIOUS.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THATHAPPENED IS THE NSA MADE ALL
KINDS OF CLAIMS OF WHAT THEYARE DOING AND NOT DOING AND
WE HAVE MADE OTHER CLAIMSAND A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE
IN CONFLICT SO WHAT I WANTEDTO DO WAS PUBLISH A DOCUMENT
THAT THE NSA CREATED WHENTHEY THOUGHT THEY WERE
SPEAKING IN PRIVATE.
THAT THEY THOUGHT NOBODY WOULDKNOW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING.
SO MANY OF THE DOCUMENTSTHEY DESCRIBE THEIR OBJECTIVES
AND MISSIONS IS WILDLYDIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SAY
IN PUBLIC SO THERE IS ONEDOCUMENT THAT SAYS OUR
COLLECTIVE POSTURE ISCOLLECT IT ALL, SNIFF IT ALL,
PROCESS IT ALL, EXPLOIT ITALL.
NOT COLLECT THECOMMUNICATION OF TERRORISTS
OR PEOPLE DOING BAD THINGS,COLLECT IT ALL.
THEY COLLECT BILLIONS, SNIFFIT ALL, EXPLOIT ALL.
>> PROCESS IT ALL.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> AND THEY COLLECT BILLIONS,BILLIONS WITH A B OF E-MAILS
AND TELEPHONE CALLS EVERYSINGLE DAY.
SO THEY DO THINGS LIKE IFPEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD BUY
ROUTERS WHICH IS FROMAMERICAN COMPANIES THEY
LITERALLY PHYSICALLY-- TAKE THEPRODUCT OUT OF THE MAIL,
OPEN UP THE PACKAGE,STICK A BACK DOOR DEVICE
INTO IT AND RESEAL IT THEFACTORY PRODUCT AND SEND IT
ON TO THE UNWITTING USER.
>> Stephen: INTERNET ROUTER,A SWITCH, A SERVER, THINGS
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSINGTHE CHINESE GOVERNMENT OF
DOING FOR YEARS AND URGINGPEOPLE NOT TO BUY CHINESE
PRODUCTS WHICH THEYTHEMSELVES HAVE BEEN DOING
SO PEOPLE WILL BUY AMERICANPRODUCTS THAT THEY CAN
INVADE.
>> Stephen: SO IF I, IF MYNET GEAR ROUTER ISN'T
WORKING ONE DAY I CAN JUSTCALL THE NSA FOR CUSTOMER
SERVICE?
>> THEY PROBABLY CAMEFROM THERE SO IT'S A GOOD
CHANCE THAT IT DID.
SO MAYBE THEY CAN HELP YOUWITH IT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU DON'T LIVE IN THEUNITED STATES ANY MORE.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, YOU LIVE INBRAZIL.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: THEY DO TERRIBLETHINGS.
THE UNITED STATES MAYCOLLECT ALL OF OUR E-MAILS
BUT THEY TAKE ALL OF YOURBODY HAIR.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHINGSHADY ABOUT THAT.
>> THAT IS THE NEXT BOOK.
>> Stephen: THAT WILL SELL ALOT.
>> THERE ARE PICTURES ANDEVERYTHING.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID THEREARE MORE STORIES COMING.
IS THERE ANYTHING AS BIG ANDAS JUICY AS HAS ALREADY BEEN
RELEASED?
>> I GENUINELY BELIEVE THATTHE STORY THAT IS THE
BIGGEST ONE THAT WILL MAKETHE BIGGEST IMPACT AND WILL
SHAPE HOW THE EVENTS OF THELAST TEN MONTHS ARE VIEWED
BY HISTORY IS THE STORY ONWHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY WORK
THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE READYWITHIN FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS ITABOUT.
>> IT IS ONE OF THE MISSINGPIECES IS ON WHOM IS THE NSA
SPYING IN AMERICA, WHO ARETHEY TARGETING, FOR WHAT
PURPOSE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLETHAT THEY ARE DECLARING TO
BE SUFFICIENT THREATS THATIT WARRANTS READING THEIR
E-MAILS AND WHAT IS THEPATTERN OF PEOPLE THAT THEY
HAVE TARGETED.
ARE THESE POLITICALDISSIDENT, CRITICS OF U.S.
FOREIGN POLICY OR TERRORIST,THAT IS THE REPORTING THAT
REMAINS TO BE DONE.
>> Stephen: IS IT GOOD NEWS?
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TOPREVIEW BUT I THINK YOU CAN
ASSUME THAT IF I THINK IT'STHE BIGGEST STORY THAT WILL
SAY HOW IT GETS REMEMBEREDTHAT WILL ARE VOLUME
INTERESTING REVELATIONS THATWE ARE WORKING AS HARD AND
FAST AS WE CAN TO GETPUBLISHED AND LOTS OF OTHER
STORIES THAT REMAIN FROM THEARCHIVES AS WELL.
