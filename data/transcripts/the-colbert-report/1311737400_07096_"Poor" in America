STATES.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU THREW THAT ONE AWAY.
NATION, JESUS SAID THE POOR
WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH US.
WELL, IT TURNS OUT JESUS DOES
NOT KNOW EVERYTHING.
FOR MORE, FOX NEWS STU VASHNY STU VARNEY
MAKES WORDS COME OUT OF HIS
MOUTH.
>> WHEN YOU THINK OF POVERTY,
YOU THINK OF THIS.
BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU IT REALLY
LOOKS LIKE THIS.
A NEW REPORT SHOWING POOR
FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES
ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE.
I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE OUR
VIEWERS A QUICK RUN-THROUGH OF
WHAT ITEMS POOR FAMILIES IN
AMERICA HAVE.
99% OF THEM HAVE A REFRIGERATOR.
(LAUGHTER)
81% HAVE A MICROWAVE.
>> Stephen: A REFRIGERATOR AND
A MICROWAVE?
THEY CAN PRESERVE AND HEAT FOOD?
OOH-LA-LA, I GUESS THE POOR ARE
TOO GOOD FOR MOLD AND
TRICHINOSIS.
IT'S ALL HERE, FOLKS, IN THE
CONSERVATIVE THINK-TANK THE
HERITAGE FOUNDATION'S NEW REPORT
"AIR CONDITIONING, CABLE T.V.
AND AN XBOX: WHAT IS POVERTY IN
THE UNITED STATES TODAY?"
AND IF YOU WATCH CLOSELY IN STU
VARNEY'S REPORT JUST THEN, YOU
SAW THAT EVIDENTLY POVERTY IS
THE PLASMA FLAT SCREEN AISLE AT
BEST BUY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE SOME OF
THE STUFF POOR PEOPLE HAVE IN
THEIR HOMES!
LUXURIES LIKE CEILING FANS,
D.V.D. PLAYERS, ANSWER MAGAZINES
AND COFFEE MAKERS.
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS!
I HAVE VALUE AIR, A BLU RAY
PLAYER, VOICE MAIL AND I GO TO
STARBUCKS EVERYDAY.
(LAUGHTER)
MUST BE NICE.
MUST BE PRETTY NICE.
(APPLAUSE)
AND $10 COFFEE MAKERS AREN'T THE
ONLY LUXURY THESE "POORS" CAN
AFFORD.
(LAUGHTER)
STU?
>> I SEEM TO REMEMBER IN THE
LAST FEW YEARS BEING TOLD THAT
SOMETHING LIKE 12% OF THE
CHILDREN IN AMERICA GO TO BED
HUNGRY AT NIGHT.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S FLAT
OUT NOT ACCURATE?
>> THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE LIE.
IT MAY BE 2% OF CHILDREN AT SOME
POINT IN THE YEAR WOULD GO TO
BED HUNGRY.
>> Stephen: 2% HUNGRY!
THAT'S THE PERFECT AMOUNT!
(LAUGHTER)
THERE'S ABOUT 150 OF US IN THIS
ROOM.
IF THREE OF US WERE HUNGRY
CHILDREN, I THINK WE'D FEEL
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, THIS REPORT PROVES THAT
POOR PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT LIVING
DOWN TO OUR EXPECTATIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
IF YOU STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO BRUSH THE FLIES OFF YOUR
EYEBALLS, YOU'RE NOT REALLY
POOR.
BECAUSE EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE
OFFICIALLY POOR ARE PROBABLY WAY
RICHER THAN YOU THINK.
BECAUSE IN DETERMINING WHETHER A
HOUSEHOLD WAS POOR, THE CENSUS
ONLY COUNTS ABOUT 4% OF THE
WELFARE SPENT ON THAT FAMILY AS
INCOME.
SO WE DON'T NEED TO GIVE THE
POOR ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT POOR THANKS TO THE
ASSISTANCE WE GIVE THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, FOLKS, THIS GREAT
SOCIETY ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAMS ARE
LIKE A DAM THAT WE BUILT TO HOLD
BACK THE RIVER OF POVERTY-- AND
IT WORKED.
SO LET'S TEAR DOWN THE DAM!
I'M SURE THE RIVER WILL STAY PUT
PUT.
BUT IF NOT AND THE POOR START
DROWNING AGAIN, WE'LL THROW THEM
A LIFE PRESERVER-- OR A
