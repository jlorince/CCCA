>> Colbert: WELCOME.
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
BOY, I CAN FEEL THE ELECTRICITY.
I CAN FEEL THE ELECTRICITY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ACROSS AMERICA, YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE EXCITED BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE NIGHT.
THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE JUST HAPPENED IN DENVER.
NOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET SO DON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS.
JIM.
>> THE BUYING QUESTION IS DO THESE DEBATES REALLY MATTER?
>> I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE THE FIRST TWO CANDIDATES AND REALLY START
TO MAKE THEIR MIND UP.
>> IF THE DEBATES HAPPEN REALLY LATE IN THE CYCLE AND BY THIS TIME MOST AMERICANS HAVE MADE UP
THEIR MIND.
>> I THINK THE DEBATES DON'T MATTER MUCH.
>> THEY MATTER AND THEY HAVE MATTER ADD GREAT DEAL, SOME YEARS THEY HAVE NOT MATTERED AT ALL.
>> Colbert: SO, WE PUNDITS DON'T KNOW WHETHER DEBATES MATTER BUT WE DO KNOW WHETHER DEBATE OVER WHETHER DEBATES
MATTER, MATTER.
>> BOTTOM LINE, BOTTOM LINE, THESE MEANINGLESS, USELESS DEBATES ARE CRUCIAL.
ESPECIALLY FOR THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN.
>> THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN LOOKS AT THIS AS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TONIGHT, THEY RECOGNIZE THIS IS THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM
TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THE COUNTRY.
THEY DON'T KNOW HILLARY.  THIS IS THE TIME FOR HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW MITT ROMNEY.
AND WE LIVE IN A VERY DISTRACTED AGE WHERE EVERYBODY HAS IPADS, IPODS, BLUEBERRIES, THEY HAVE STUFF IN THEIR EAR.
>> OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
..
>> ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS THAT?  WHAT IS THAT?  YEAH, NO. HOLD ON.  CAN YOU HOLD ON?  I HAVE ANOTHER CALL.
HOLD ON.
HELLO?  HELLO?  YES?  UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
YOU HAVE GOT WHAT?  I HAVE GOT -- I HAVE GOT A WHAT IN MY EAR?  YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP YAVMENT HEAR YOU I HAVE A BANANA IN MY EAR.
HMM, HMM, HMM.
>> THAT GOT IN THERE.
>> I WILL CALL YOU BACK.
BUT PAPA BEAR HAS GOT A POINT.
THESE ELECTRONIC GADGETS THAT WE ALL HAVE NOW -- THEY GIVE US -- THEY GIVE US INFORMATION 24/7, NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE, AND IT
HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS.
I WANT TO SAY LET'S -- ANYWAY, WHOEVER HE IS, HE NEEDS TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO AMERICA AGAIN.
SURE WE MET HIM BRIEFLY AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, DURING THE PRIMARIES, DURING THE 2008 PRIMARIES, AND WHEN HE WAS
GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, BUT HE JUST WON'T STICK.
HE IS LIKE THAT GUY AT THE PARTY YOU HAVE SEEN A MILLION TIMES BUT YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME.
THAT'S WHY HE TRAILS NOT ONLY OBAMA IN THE POLLS BUT ALSO WHAT IS GOING ON BUYING GUY AND HEY, THERE, CHIEF.
WITH WHAT IS GOING ON BIG GUY?
>> I CAN'T.
I TOLD YOU I WOULD CALL.
>> AND HE IS BEHIND DESPITE HIS INSPIRING POPULIST MESSAGE, VOTE FOR ME, YOU
