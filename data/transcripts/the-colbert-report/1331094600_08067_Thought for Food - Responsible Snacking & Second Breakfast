THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANKS, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THEY SAY THE WAY TO A MAN'S
HEART IS THROUGH HIS STOMACH.
BUT AFTER A CONCERTED EFFORT TO
CRAM MEAT THROUGH MY BELLY
BUTTON, I'M GOING BACK TO MY
MOUTH.
THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD.
♪ ♪
FOLKS, I'M A CHOCOHOLIC.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO UPSET WHEN I
SAW THIS.
>> CRITICAL NEWS TODAY FOR CANDY
BAR LOVERS.
THEY'RE  MAKING THEM SMALLER.
THE MARS COMPANY HAVE SAID THEY
WILL STOP  SELLING CHOCOLATE
PRODUCTS WITH MORE THAN 250
CALORIES IN THEM BY THE END OF
NEXT YEAR.
AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, MEANS NO
500-CALORIE KING-SIZE SNICKERS
OR MILKY WAY BARS.
>> Stephen: I WOULD CRY, BUT MY
TEAR DUCTS ARE CLOGGED WITH
NOUGAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ACCORDING TO THE MARS COMPANY,
THE CHANGE IS TO PROMOTE, QUOTE
"RESPONSIBLE SNACKING."
OH, GREAT.
NOW, I NEED TO SNACK
RESPONSIBLY.
CAN I GET THAT NESTLE CRUNCH
WITH BROWN RICE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
COULD I GET JUST THE IKES, WITH
THE MIKES ON THE SIDE?
AND I'LL HAVE JUST AN M.
I'M DRIVING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T WANT A SMALLER BAR.
I WANT A BAR SO BIG, THAT WHILE
I'M EATING ONE END, THE OTHER
END IS STILL ROLLING OFF THE
FACTORY LINE.
YOU DON'T BUY IT -- YOU GET A
SUBSCRIPTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS A SAD DAY FOR AMERICA'S
MOUTHS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I REMEMBER WHEN WE LED THE WORLD
IN SNACKS-PLORATION.
WHEN THE RUSSKIES HIT US WITH
SPUTNIK, WE HIT 'EM BACK WITH
THE TOP SECRET WHATCHAMACALLIT
PROGRAM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S
CALLED.
AND AMERICA WON THE SPACE RACE
OF TAKING UP THE MOST SPACE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
AMERICA MUST NOT RETREAT.
WE MUST CONTINUE TO DREAM OF A
FUTURE WITH FUDGE-COVERED TREATS
SO LARGE, THAT BY THE END OF THE
DECADE, AMERICA WILL PUT A MAN
ON THE MOON PIE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NEXT, FOLKS, IT'S BEEN SIX
GLORIOUS YEARS SINCE TACO BELL
ADDRESSED LATE-NIGHT HUNGER WITH
THEIR REVOLUTIONARY "FOURTH
MEAL."
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHICH, OF COURSE, FALLS BETWEEN
DINNER AND WAKING UP ON A
FOOSBALL TABLE COVERED WITH YOUR
OWN FILTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
BUT BRACE YOURSELF, FOLKS.
BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN, AMERICANS
ARE EXPANDING THEIR MEALTIME
HORIZONS.
>> DO YOU EVER GET THAT
MID-MORNING HUNGER AFTER YOU'VE
ALREADY EATEN?
WHY NOT JUST HAVE A SECOND
BREAKFAST?
EXPERTS SAY MORE ON-THE-GO
AMERICANS ARE CONSUMING MORE
MORNING CALORIES OVER SEVERAL
HOURS INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN TO
ONE BIG BREAKFAST PLATE.
>> Stephen: FINALLY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SECOND BREAKFAST.
FOR TOO LONG, WE'VE BEEN STUCK
WITH STRICT GOVERNMENT-APPROVED
TIME-SLOTS FOR CRAMMING THINGS
IN OUR FACE SLOTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
I ALWAYS GET HUNGRY AFTER
BREAKFAST.
IN FACT, SOMETIMES I GET HUNGRY
DURING BREAKFAST.
I NEED SOMETHING TO TIDE ME OVER
WHILE MY FORK MOVES FROM MY EGGS
TO MY POTATOES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT
SECOND BREAKFAST IS THAT IT HAS
ROOTS IN LEGEND.
>> GENTLEMEN, WE DO NOT STOP
TILL NIGHTFALL.
>> WHAT ABOUT BREAKFAST?
>> WE'VE ALREADY HAD IT.
>> WE'VE HAD ONE, YES.
WHAT ABOUT SECOND BREAKFAST
>> Stephen: LITTLE KNOWN FACT:
IN TOLKEIN'S ORIGINAL DRAFT, THE
RINGS OF POWER WERE MADE OF
ONION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, LIKE COLUMBUS EATING THE
NEW WORLD, WE MUST EXPLORE NEW
VISTAS OF MEALTIME.
NOT JUST BREAKFAST, BUT SECOND
BREAKFAST POST-BREAKFAST
PRE-BRUNCH BRUNCH BR-LUNCH
LUNCH.
DINNER PREQUEL.
APPETIZERS, APPE-TEASERS,
TWILIGHT BUFFET, DINNER, SUPPER,
NOSH, FOURTH MEAL, MIDNIGHT
SNUNCH, SLEEP-BREAKFAST,
DREAM-PPETIZERS, AND PRE-DAWN
FONDUE NIGHTMARE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOW, ALL THIS FOOD TALK IS
MAKING ME HUNGRY.
I COULD GO FOR A KING-SIZE
SNICKERS.
NO!
I'LL HAVE TO GO WITH THREE
REGULAR ONES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
