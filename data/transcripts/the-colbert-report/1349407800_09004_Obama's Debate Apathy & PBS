( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> OH, YES!
OH, I AM FEELING GOOD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYBODY ELSE DO SEE THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT?
FOLKS, IT A WHOLE NEW HORSE RACE!
MITT SMOKED OBAMA!
METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE, MORMONS CAN'T SMOKE!
AND FOLKS, AFTER LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE IN DENVER OUR IMAGE OF THESE TWO MEN HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED.
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT.
>> IT LOOKED LIKE ROMNEY WANTED TO BE THERE AND PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE.
>> Stephen: YES!
IT WAS LIKE OBAMA WASN'T EVEN THERE.
HE HASN'T DONE THIS POORLY SINCE HE DEBATED CLINT EASTWOOD.
(LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MEANWHILE, ROMNEY WAS THE ALPHA MITT, SLAPPING OBAMA AROUND.
AND, ANYONE ELSE WHO GOT IN MITT AWAY.
>> I'M SORRY, JIM, I'M GOING TO STOP THE SUBSIDY TO PBS.
I WILL STOP OTHER THINGS.
I LIKE PBS.
I LIKE BIG BIRD, I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU TOO.
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP ON SPENDING MONEY FOR THINGS TO BORROW FROM CHINA TO PAY FOR IT.
>> Stephen: HE JUST TOLD THE MODERATOR WHO WORKS AT PBS, I'M GOING TO THROW YOUR ASS OUT ON THE STREET, OLD MAN!
YOU--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU, NOT ONLY YOU-- BUT ALL THOSE FREELOADING MUPPETS.
THAT TAKES NOT JUST ONE BALL, BUT TWO, TWO ENORMOUS
