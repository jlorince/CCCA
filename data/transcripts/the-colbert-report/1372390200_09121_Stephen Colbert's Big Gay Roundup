OH, THEY'LL BE FINE.
FOLKS, YESTERDAY THE SUPREME
COURT OVERTURNED THE DEFENSE
OF MARRIAGE ACT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I LIKE TO CHEER FOR PRETTY
COLORS TOO.
BUT THEY ARE SURRENDERING
THIS COUNTRY TO THE RADICAL
GAY AGENDA OF JOINT TAX
RETURNS.
IT'S UNNATURAL.
BUT LUCKILY ONE TV SHOW IS
NOT BACKING DOWN.
AND I HOPE IT'S THIS ONE.
THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S
BIG GAY ROUND UP.
(APPLAUSE)
YEE WHAT!
-- I WANT TO THANK MY OLD
PAL INTERNATIONAL MOVIE STAR
STEVE CAR REL FOR NEVER
ASKING ME HOW I WOULD USE
THAT FOOTAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A GOOD
MAN.
NOW FIRST IN THE GAY ROUNDUP,
FOLKS, I TRUST THE GAYS
ABOUT AS FAR AS I COULD
THROW THEM.
NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW, I
DON'T PICK UP GAY MEN TO
THROW OR ANY OTHER REASON.
COME TO THINK OF, IT,
THEY'RE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN
I AM SO IT MIGHT BE EASIER
TO LET THEM THROW ME BUT I
GUESS I TRUST THE GAYS LESS
FAR THAN THEY COULD THROW ME,
ARE WE CLEAR?
GOD, THEY HAVE TO COMPLICATE
EVERYTHING.
AND NOW THEY'RE COMPLICATING
BLOOD DONATION.
>> THE AMERICAN MEDICAL
ASSOCIATION IS PUSHING FOR A
REVERSAL OF A DECADES-OLD
BAN ON BLOOD DONATIONS FROM
GAY MEN SAYING THAT THE LAW
IS OUTDATED.
GAY MEN HAVE BEEN BANNED
FROM DONATING BLOOD SINCE
THE AIDS CRISIS IN THE
1980s.
BUT NOW THE AMA SAYS THERE
ARE BETTER TESTING
PROCEDURES AND BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF HIV.
>> Stephen: FOLKS LETING GAY
PEOPLE DONATE BLOOD IS AN
ENDORSEMENT OF THE GAY
LIFESTYLE.
IN FACT, I'M PRETTY SURE A
GAY BLOOD TRANSFUSION IS HOW
YOU GET GAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE BEING
BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE
SPIDER.
YOU GET ALL THE GAY
SUPERPOWER SUPERSTRENGTH,
WEB SLINGING AND THE DESIRE
TO WEAR SKIN TIGHT SPANDEX
ON BROADWAY.
NEXT ON THE ROUNDUP-- , LIKE
A TRUE AMERICAN, I LOVE ALL
THINGS DISNEY.
MOSTLY BECAUSE ALL THINGS
ARE OWNED BY DISNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
AN MY FAVORITE SHOW IS THE
DISNEY CHANNEL GOOD LUCK
CHARLIE, A FAMILY SITCOM
ABOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF
RAISING FIVE CHILDREN.
NOW AS A FAN I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN KICKED RIGHT IN
THE MICKEYS BECAUSE IN A
FIRST FOR THE DISNEY CHANNEL,
NEXT SEASON ONE OF LITTLE
CHARLIE'S PLAY DATES WILL BE
WITH A KID WHO HAS TWO MOMS.
TWO MOMS!
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE HAVING
THEIR OWN PLAY DATE WITH
CRAYONS AND CONSTRUCTION
PAPER, OR AS THEY CALL IT,
SCISSORING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OH, I KNOW, I
KNOW.
UGLY STUFF.
FOLKS, I AM OUTRAGED AND I
AM NOT ALONE.
THE FAITH AND FREEDOM
NETWORK AND FOUNDATION
RAILED, THE ENTERTAINMENT
INDUSTRY IS DOING EVERYTHING
HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO NORMALIZE
HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONS AN ON
THE TEA PARTY NATION THEY'RE
SAYING WALT DISNEY MUST BE
SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE, YES,
OR AT THE VERY LEAST SOMEONE
HAS PUT HIS FROZEN HEAD ON A
LAZY SUSAN.
DISNEY, I DEMAND THAT YOU
DROP THIS TWO MOMMIES PLOT
AND GO BACK TO DELIVERING
WHOLESOME MESSAGES.
LIKE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN
THAT THEY CAN BE A PRINCESS
IF THEY LET A MAN MAKE OUT
WITH HIM WHILE THEY'RE
DRUGGED.
OR-- OR--
(APPLAUSE)
OR THAT THERE IS NOTHING
WRONG WITH BEASTIALITY IF A
CANDLE SAYS IT'S OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
