>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, BEFORE WE GO, ON
SATURDAY NIGHT IS THE END OF
THE WORLD.
DON'T FORGET TO TURN YOUR
CLOCKS BACK TO NEVER NEEDING
YOUR CLOCKS AGAIN.
I CAN'T ENJOY THE APOCALYPSE
WITH YOU.
I WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.
YOU CAN TRACK MY BOAT, THE
SPIRIT OF JUNO AT THIS
ADDRESS SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHEN I'M SWALLOWED BY THE
KRAKAAKEN AND SINCE THIS IS
THE VERY LAST SHOW, LET'S
TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE WE GO
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO THE
HISTORY OF LIFE ON EARTH.
(LAUGHTER)
