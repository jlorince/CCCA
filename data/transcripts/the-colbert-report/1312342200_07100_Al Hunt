>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
WASHINGTON EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF
BLOOMBERG NEWS.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE DEBT
CEILING.
PLEASE WELCOME AL HUNT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW IS THE GOOD LADY?
>> SHE'S JUST FINE.
SHE SAID TO SAY HI TO YOU.
>> Stephen: AL, YOU ARE A
CONSUMMATE WASHINGTON INSIDER.
YOU'VE BEEN A JOURNALIST IN
WASHINGTON FOR 42 YEARS.
FOR 35 OF THOSE YEARS YOU WROTE
FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS YOU'VE
BEEN WASHINGTON EXECUTIVE EDITOR
OF BLOOMBERG NEWS.
YOU HOST THE POLITICAL CAPITAL
WITH AL HUNT AND MAKE THE
APPEARANCES ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS,
GET OUT THERE AND GIVE YOUR
OPINIONS OUT THERE.
I JUST LEARNED EARLIER THAT WE
MIGHT GET DOWNGRADED BY MOODIES
AND STANDARD & POOR'S BECAUSE OF
WAY WASHINGTON DOES OR DOES NOT
WORK.
I LIKE CONFLICT, BUT I DON'T
WANT HIGHER MORTGAGE PAYMENTS.
CAN WASHINGTON WORK AGAIN?
>> PROBABLY NOT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.
AL HUNT, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PITHY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.
>> IT USED TO WORK IN A
DIFFERENT WAY.
ITyM WASN'T THAT THEY AVOIDED HUGE
FIGHTS.
TIP O'NEIL AND RONALD REAGAN
THEY DISAGREED TOTALLY.
>> Stephen: THEY WE LIKE BARE
CHEST BARE KNUCKLED BOXING.
>> AND THEY WERE SUCH A VOICE OF
YESTERYEAR BUT THEY HAD A 5:00
P.M. RULE.
THEY WOULD FIGHT UNTIL 5:00 P.M.
AND THEY WOULD HAVE A DRINK
TOGETHER WHICH THEY WOULD DO
OCCASIONALLY.
THEY WOULD FIGHT OVER BUDGET
CUTS, FIGHT OVER WARS BUT THEY
GOT THINGS DONE.
THEY GOT SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM.
THEY GOT A TAX REFORM BILL
THROUGH.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID THAT
STOP?
THAT SOUNDS FUN.
AT NIGHT YOU GET TOGETHER AND
HAVE A COUPLE OF POPS AND PLAN
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT
ABOUT THE NEXT DAY.
>> SOME PEOPLE WERE EARLIER.
>> Stephen: AND THEN THE
FIGHTS GOOD GET G. WHEN DID THAT
STOP?
>> THE LATE 80s AND EARLY
90s.
YOU HAVE THE 24/7 MEDIA.
THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON HAVE A
FUND RAIDER.
THEY ARE IN A CONSTANT CAMPAIGN
MODE.
MEDIA PLAYS A ROLE, MONEY PLAYS
A ROLE.
IT'S A 50/50 COUNTRY.
>>.
>> Stephen: WAS IT NOT A 50/
OAK COUNTRY BEFORE?
>> FOR MOST OF THE 60s IT WAS
A PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRATIC
COUNTRY.
A GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WERE
PASSED BECAUSE OF THE SENATOR.
>> Stephen: AND HE FREED THE
SLAVES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T MAT WE'RE
WHAT CENTURY STILL THE MID
60s.
>> I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT
STORY.
>> Stephen: YOU BROKE THAT
ONE.
[LAUGHTER]
MITCH McCONNELL SAID THAT THIS
HAS NOW SET THE TEMPLATE FOR THE
REPUBLICAN BEHAVIOR WHEN IT
COMES TO NEGOTIATING WITH THE
PRESIDENT.
CERTAINLY OVER THE DEBT CEILING
AND ABOUT ABOUT THE BUDGET AND
ANYTHING.
HOW DID OBAMA KEEP HIS PANTS UP
NOW?
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE THEY HANDED HIS ASS TO HIM
SO SEVERELY IN THIS NEGOTIATION?
[LAUGHTER]
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE THROWN
THAT GOLF MATCH.
I THINK OBAMA LOST.
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT
THAT.
I DON'T AGREE THAT REPUBLICANS
WON.
IF THEY MADE THIS GRAND BAR DBAJ
WHICH -- BARGAIN BUT REPUBLICANS
COULD HAVE TRIED SHRINK THE
GOVERNMENT BUT THEY NEEDED TO
REDUCE SOCIAL SECURITY.
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A DEAL IN
THAT.
WE'RE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE WERE
APRIL 2.
WE'RE FIGHTING OVER THE BUSH TAX
CUTS.
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT.
WE'RE FIGHTING OVER MEDICARE,
THE SAME FIGHTS WE HAD BEFORE.
>> Stephen: WHO DO YOU THINK
IS LOOKING STRONGEST IN THE
REPUBLICAN FIELD?
ROMNEY HAS TONS OF CASH BUT
BACHMANN HAS CRAZY POWER.
[LAUGHTER]
I WOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE MICHEL
E BACHMANN PARTICULARLY IF
GOVERNOR PERRY DOESN'T GET IN
THE RACE.
YOU THINK SHE HAS A CHANCE TO
WIN IN IOWA, THE STRAW POLL IN A
COUPLE OF WEEKS.
THE NOMINEE HAS TO WIN EITHER
IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK OBAMA
RAISED EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH FOR
PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT HE COULD OR
COULD NOT DO.
>> DID HE.
HE SAID HE WOULD CHANGE THE
CULTURE OF WASHINGTON.
IT WASSEN AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TASK.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK HE
HAS RAISED NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT
HOW FAST YOU CAN CAVE IN
NEGOTIATIONS, UNFAIRLY?
>> NAMELY YOU ASK THEM WHAT THEY
WANT AND YOU GIVE IT TO THEM.
>> I THINK HE HAS BEEN INJURED
BY.
4LQj"BRAND HAS BEEN INJURED BY THIS.
THEY'VE LOOKED TO EXTREME, AND
TOO UNBALANCED.
I DON'T THINK IT HELPED
REPUBLICANS.
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THIS WAS A
LOSE-LOSE FOR BOTH SIDES.
>> Stephen: HAS IT HELPED
ANYBODY?
IT'S GIVING GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
>> MITCH McCONNELL WAS HELPED
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE STAYED
INTO THE BACKGROUND.
>> Stephen: HE JUST RETREATED
INTO HIS SHELL.
[LAUGHTER]
AL THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AL HUNT OF BLOOMBERG
