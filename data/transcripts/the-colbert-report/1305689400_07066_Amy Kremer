EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEADER OF
THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT.
I'LL ASK HER WHY THE FOUNDING
FATHERS HATED OBAMA CARE.
PLEASE WELCOME AMY KREMER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HI, AMY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: I GOT TO GIVE YOU
PROMISE RIGHT AWAY.
THE TEA PARTY, I TRIED TO GET
THESE PARTY WHIPPED UP.
I TRIED TO GET AMERICA WHIPPED
UP, BUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE
YEARS, YOU PEOPLE HAVE WHIPPED
AMERICA INTO STIFF PEAKS, LIKE A
MERINGUE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BAKE, BUT
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
>> THANK YOU.
WE'RE TRYING.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PASSION.
IT'S ALL ABOUT FISCAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU CAN'T SPEND MORE THAN YOU
MAKE.
OUR GOVERNMENT IS OUT THERE
CHARGING WITH OUR CREDIT CARD.
>> Stephen: I CAN BECAUSE I
KNOW I'LL JUST MAKE IT BACK
TOMORROW.
NOW, LET'S TRASH TALK A LITTLE
BIT.
YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE TEA
PARTY PATRIOTS.
>> TEA PARTY EXPRESS.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
IS THE TEA PARTY EXPRESS, IS
THAT LIKE HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS?
DO YOU COME WITH A CONTINENTAL
BREAKFAST IS WHAT I'M ASKING?
>> WE'RE THE BUSES THAT GO
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: OH, YOU'RE THE BUS
PEOPLE.
>> WE'RE THE BUS PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: FANTASTIC.
YOU WERE A DELTA FLIGHT
ATTENDANT.
>> I WAS A DELLA FLIGHT
ATTENDANT.
I LOVE TO TRAVEL.
>> Stephen: IF I WORKED FOR
DELTA, I WOULD PREFER A BUS AS
WELL.
>> IT'S A BUS IN THE SKY.
THAT'S ALL IT IS.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE ACCUSE THE
TEA PARTY OF BEING A BRANCH OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
TRUE OR FALSE?
>> THAT'S FALSE.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY...
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED
BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS AGAINST
OBAMA.
WHAT HAPPENED 27 DAYS INTO
OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY THAT MADE ALL
YOU DEMOCRATS TURN AGAINST HIM?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF
ALL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS MORE
AFRAID OF US THAN THE DEMOCRAT
ING PARTY, BUT THIS MOVEMENT IS
A DIRECT RESULT OF PEOPLE BEING
FED UP AND ANGRY WITH BOTH
POLITICAL PARTIES.
>> Stephen: BUT THERE WEREN'T
A LOT OF SIGNS SHOWING JOHN
BOEHNER WITH A BONE THROUGH HIS
NOSE.
>> THIS MOVEMENT, PEOPLE GOT FED
UP WHEN BUSH WAS IN OFFICE WITH
THE SPENDING, AND IT'S
ESCALATED, SO PEOPLE ARE COMING,
YOU KNOW, TO THE MOVEMENT AND
JOINING THE MOVEMENT BECAUSE
THEY WANT RESPONSIBILITY.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO MOTIVATE
PEOPLE.
>> PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATESSED.
>> Stephen: I NEED TO KNOW HOW
TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE THE WAY YOU
DID.
WHILE PEOPLE WERE FRUSTRATED
WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, THEY
WEREN'T MARCHING IN THE STREETS
UNTIL OBAMA WAS IN.
WHAT COULD I TELL MY PEOPLE THAT
YOU TOLD YOUR PEOPLE THAT
CHANGED EVERYTHING?
>> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
PRESIDENT BUSH OR PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
>> Stephen: IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO WHY EVEN HAVE A
PRESIDENT?
WHY CAN'T WE JUST RULE BY MOB?
WHY CAN'T WE JUST CHANT IN THE
STREET?
>> IT'S THE BALANCE OF POWER.
IT'S THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.
>> Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN A
FAN OF THE JUDICIAL BRASH.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS FILLER,
LIKE SAWDUST.
>> THERE'S THREE BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT.
IT'S BALANCE OF POWER, BUT IT'S
CONGRESS THAT CONTROLS THE PURSE
STRINGS, AND IT'S CONGRESS THAT
IS SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK DEBT
CEILING.
>> TALK DEBT CEILING.
>> Stephen: DO WE LET THE
UNITED STATES HIT THE DEBT
CEILING AND LAPSE ON ITS
PAYMENTS?
>> GUESS WHAT, WE HIT THE DEBT
CEILING YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen: THEY'VE MASSAGED
THE BOOKS.
>> YOU JUST SAID IT.
WE BRING IN ENOUGH TAX REVENUE
TO SERVICE OUR DEBT.
WE BRING IN ENOUGH TAX REVENUE
TO SERVICE OUR DEBT, PAY FOR
MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SOCIAL
SECURITY AND STILL HAVE ABOUT
$300 OR $400 BILLION LEFT OVER.
WHY HAVE A DEBT CEILING IF THEY
CONTINUE TO RAISE IT?
BY RAISING ITILUS GIVES THEM
POWER...
>> Stephen: I'M WITH YOU ON WE
HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE, BUT WE
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH
REVENUE.
>> WE NEED TO STOP SPENDING.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE ENOUGH
REVENUE FOR WHAT I WANT THE
COUNTRY TO DO.
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE FOR
WHAT THE COUNTRY IS DOING RIGHT
NOW.
I BELIEVE WE BUILD A WALL AT THE
BORDERS AND TELL THE WORLD...
[WHISTLES]
AND THEN INSIDE BASICALLY YOU
NEED NOTHING FOR THE GOVERNMENT
TO DO.
>> NO, I MEAN, WE HAVE TO REIN
IN THE SPENDING.
>> Stephen: I AGREE.
IS THERE ANY SITUATION IN WHICH
WE SHOULD RAISE TAXES?
>> WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT
RAISING TAXES, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT SPENDING MORE MONEY.
STOP THE SPENDING.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE DEBT TO
PAY OFF.
HOW DO WE PAY OFF THE DEBT?
>> WE HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE WE $14
TRILLION IN DEBT THEN?
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE SPENDING MORE
THAN WE'RE BRINGING IN.
THEY KEEP SPENDING AND SPENDING
AND SPENDING.
>> Stephen: BUT IT WILL TAKE
US 50 YEARS TO PAY OFF THE DEBT.
IS THERE ANY SITUATION BY WHICH
WE SHOULD RAISE TAXES?
>> AGAIN, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
RAISING TAXES...
>> Stephen: YES OR NO.
IS THERE ANY SITUATION FOR
RAISING TAXES?
>> I THINK WE SHOULD CLOSE THE
CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES.
>> Stephen: EXCUSE ME, MADAM.
I AM A CORPORATION.
IF YOU CLOSE THE HOLES ON MY
LOOPS, ALL I'M LEFT WITH IS
STRINGS.
HOW DARE YOU, MADAM.
YOU ARE RAISING TAXES ON ME BY
CLOSING CORPORATE LOOPHOLES.
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO PAY YOUR
TAXES.
>> Stephen: GET OUT.
[APPLAUSE]
HERE'S THE SITUATION, HERE'S THE
SITUATION, NUCLEAR BOMBS
SOMEWHERE IN NEW YORK.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIND OUR
WHERE THE BOMB IS AND SAVE EIGHT
MILLION PEOPLE IS TO RAISE THE
TAX RATE ON THE TOP 2% OF
AMERICANS FROM 33% TO 36.9%.
DO WE DO IT?
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE, WAIT,
TICKING TIME BOMB.
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS.
THE BOMB IS ABOUT TO GO OFF.
DO YOU RAISE TAXES TO SAVE EIGHT
MILLION PEOPLE?
BABIES, ORPHANS.
NUNS.
YOUR OWN FAMILY IS SAYING,
PLEASE, PLEASE, TAXES.
>> HOW ABOUT YOU CALL UP THE
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND TELL THEM
TO STOP CREATING...
>> Stephen: THEY'RE ON THE
PHONE SAYING, PLEASE, RAISE
TAXES.
THE GUY HAS TOLD ME IT WILL SAVE
ALL THESE LIVES.
RAISE TAXES $1.
RAISE THEM $1 AND YOU'LL SAVE
THE LIFE OFFING A MILLION
WAKIES.
>> TELL THEM TO STOP CREATING
THE SECOND INCOME FOR THE F-35
AND SAVE $3 BILLION AND THEN THE
NUCLEAR BOMB WON'T GO OFF.
>> Stephen: I LOVE YOU.
THAT'S A PERFECT ANSWER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

KREMER, ONE
