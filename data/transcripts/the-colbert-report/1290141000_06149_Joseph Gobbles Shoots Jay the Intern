EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, THIS IS AN HISTORIC NIGHT
BECAUSE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE,
TEA PARTY FAVORITE AND GROOMED
YETI JOE MILLER HAS WON THE
ALASKAN SENATE RACE.
WHOO!
WAY TO GO, JOE.
IT IS MILLER TIME, BROUGHT TO
YOU BY MY SPONSOR, COORS LIGHT.
NOW, SURE THE A.P. HAS DECLARED
THAT INCUMBENT SENATOR LISA
MURKOWSKI HAS ACTUALLY BEAT
MILLER AND DEMOCRAT SCOTT
MACADAMS TO BECOME FIRST
WRITE-IN CANDIDATE TO WIN A
SENATE VICTORY SINCE 1954 WHEN
IN A RUN-OFF STROM THURMOND
NARROWLY DEFEATED BLACK PEOPLE,
BUT JOE HAS NOT GIVEN UP,
DESPITE THE FACT THE ALASKA
G.O.P. IS URGING HIM TO STEP
DOWN.
THEY'RE SAYING HE SHOULD END HIS
CAMPAIGN IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER.
THAT'S GOT TO HURT JOE.
HE WAS SO CONFIDENT.
