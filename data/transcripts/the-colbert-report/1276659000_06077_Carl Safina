>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ECOLOGIST
WHO WANTS AMERICANS TO VALUE OUR
OCEAN.
RIGHT NOW I SAY WE VALUE THEM
ABOUT $2.99 A GALLON.
PLEASE WELCOME DR. CARL SAFINA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DR. CARL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT.
>> IS THERE ANY OIL IN THIS
WATER?
>> Stephen: EXCUSE ME?
>> IS THERE ANY OIL IN THIS
WATER?
>> Stephen: LET'S FIND OUT.
NOW, SIR, YOU ARE THE CO-FOUNDER
AND PRESIDENT OF THE BLUE OCEAN
IBSTY OUT THE.
WHAT DO YOU HOPE DO WITH THE
BLUE OCEAN?
>> WELL, WE HOPE TO LET PEOPLE
APPRECIATE IT.
AND I THINK WE ARE NOT GOING TO
RUN OUT OF WORK ANY TIME SOON.
>> Stephen: DON'T YOU THINK,
AND I'M MAD AS HELL AS B.P.
I'M MAD AS HELL AT THE ENGLISH.
I JUST GOT FURIOUS WITH THE
MARSHALL ISLANDS.
>> I KNOW A FEW OF THEM.
>> Stephen: VERY BAD PEOPLE.
YOU GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR THEM.
BUT CAN I LOOK AT A SILVER
LINING?
WE APPRECIATE THE GULF OF MEXICO
IN WAYS WE DIDN'T BEFORE.
DON'T IT ALWAYS SEEM TO GO, YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT UNTIL
IT'S GONE.
WE HAVE LITERALLY PAVED
PARADISE.
>> WE'VE TARMACKED PARADISE AT
THIS POINT.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN DOWN
TO THE GULF?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU SEE?
>> OIL TO THE FAR HORDES IN A
PLANE, IN A, ON MANY OF THE
BEACHES.
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE,
WILDLIFES, RESTAURANTS.
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT SOUTH
CAROLINA.
FISHING IS HUGE THERE.
HOW MUCH OF THE GULF IS SHUT
DOWN FROM LIKE SHELLING,
SHRIMPING AND FISHING?
>> ABOUT ONE-THIRD RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: ONE-THIRD OF THE
GULF?
>> PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK AND
MAY NEVER GET BACK TO WORK.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LET
CORPORATIONS CALL THE SHOTS
BECAUSE WE DON'T INSIST THAT OUR
GOVERNMENT IS OUR WATCHDOG.
>> Stephen: I'M WITH SARAH
PALIN ON THIS ONE.
SHE SAYS THE ONLY REASON WE'RE
DRILLING DEEP IS THAT WE
COULDN'T DRILL IN ANWR AND IT'S
REALLY YOU ENVIRONMENTALISTS
FAULT THAT WE HAD TO DRILL DEEP
IN THE OCEAN.
DON'T YOU BEAR ALMOST ALL OF THE
BLAME?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I WOULD SAY...
>> Stephen: DUDS THAT SHOCK
YOU THAT YOU'RE NAILED THAT
HARD?
>> I WOULD SAY I SHARE MOST OF
THE BLAME YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE LENGTH
OF THE IMPACT IN THE GULF?
>> I THINK THAT IT WILL BE YEARS
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YEARS
FOR A LOT OF THE MARSHES AND THE
BEACHES AND THE REAL ESTATE
VALUES, AND I HOPE I'M WRONG.
I REALLY DO HOPE I'M WRONG.
>> Stephen: I'M FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA.
I HEAR ALL ABOUT THIS LOOP
CURRENT THAT WILL GRAB THIS OIL
AND SWING IT UP THE EAST COAST
AND DUMP THE OIL ON MY BEACHES
DOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.
>> Stephen: BUT RIGHT NOW IT
KIND OF IS.
NOW WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN, IT'S GOING TO
GO UP THE EAST COAST, AS WELL.
RIGHT NOW NO OFFENSE, NO OFFENSE
TO THE GULF COAST.
I BELIEVE IN THE GULF COAST, I'M
MAD, I WANT TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE
DOWN THERE.
BUT WE AS AMERICANS IN GENERAL
TEND TO GO, THE GULF COAST,
TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN THERE
BECAUSE KATRINA HAPPENED DOWN
THERE, RIGHT?
>> YES, BUT THIS IS VERY
DIFFERENT BECAUSE KATRINA CAME
AND WENT.
KATRINA BROUGHT WIND AND WATER,
AND WHEN IT STOPPED, THE WIND
AND WATER WENT AWAY.
THIS WILL BRING SOMETHING THAT
WILL STAY.
SO THIS IS NOT REALLY LIKE
KATRINA.
THIS IS BIG OIL CHERNOBYL.
>> Stephen: THEN WHAT WILL IT
DO TO BIG OIL?
IT SOUNDS LIKE ARE THEY GOING TO
BE DAMAGED BY THIS BECAUSE
LISTEN, ONCE AGAIN, I'M MAD AT
B.P.
I'M MAD AT THE ENGLISH, BUT I
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO
OVERBOARD WITH REGULATION.
ISN'T THE RESPONSE HERE LET'S
JUST BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME
AND OBVIOUSLY HOLD PEOPLE'S FEET
TO THE FIRE IF SOMETHING DOES GO
WRONG AND NAIL THEM FOR SOME
CASH.
I'M ALL FOR THAT, BUT NOT
REGULATION.
>> WHAT YOU WANT IS CALLED
REGULATION.
RIGHT NOW...
>> IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.
UNLESS SOMETHING GOES WRONG.
>> IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, THE
COMPANIES ARE LIABLE FOR $750
MILLION, BUT THERE IS NO LIMIT
TO HOW MUCH DAMAGE THEY CAN
CAUSE, RIGHT?
SO ISN'T THAT THE GOVERNMENT
BACKWARDS?
ISN'T THAT THE GOVERNMENT
PROTECTING CORPORATE GREED
INSTEAD OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST?
>> Stephen: THAT'S A FREE
MARKET.
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BUY OIL
ANYMORE, THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
>> IT'S NOT THE FREE MARKET.
IT'S THE MARKET DISTORTED BY
SUBSIDIES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
BEST GOVERNMENT THAT MONEY CAN
BUY.
WE HAVE BEEN ASLEEP AT THE
SWITCH WHILE GOVERNMENT HAS...
CORPORATIONS HAVE BOUGHT
GOVERNMENT OUT FROM UNDER US AND
WE GET NO OVERSIGHT.
WE GET THE REGULATORS PARTYING
AND SMOKING WEED AND HAVING SEX
WITH THE OIL PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE REGULATING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WHY WAS I NEVER
INVITED TO ONE OF THOSE PARTIES.
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT A JOB
IN THE OIL INDUSTRY.
>> Stephen: WHO WAS HAVING SEX
WITH WHOM HERE?
>> IT'S THE OIL MANAGEMENT
SERVICE.
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO GET PAID
MORE BY WORKING FOR THE OIL
INDUSTRY.
SO THEY LIKE THE COZY
RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THE
GOVERNMENT HASN'T BEEN THE
WATCHDOG FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FOR THE LAST
30 YEARS WE'VE HAD THE SPIRIT OF
DEREGULATION.
WE THINK GOVERNMENT IS A BAD
THING.
AT LEAST WITH THE POLICE, WE
UNDERSTAND THE POLICE ARE HERE
TO PROTECT US FROM THE BAD GUYS.
BUT WITH THE REST OF GOVERNMENT,
WE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE
GOVERNMENT IS HERE TO PROTECT US
FROM THE BAD GUYS.
>> Stephen: WELL, DOCTOR,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
DR. CARL SAFINA OF THE BLUE
OCEAN INSTITUTION.
