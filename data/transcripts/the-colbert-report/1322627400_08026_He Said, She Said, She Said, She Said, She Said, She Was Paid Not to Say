(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT CHANTING WOULD SOUND GREAT
ACCOMPANIED BY SOME GOURD.
NATION, I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE
HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE I DO NOT
WANT TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE, FRANKLY, MY FAITH IN
WOMAN KIND HAS BEEN SHAKEN.
BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN, A TROUBLED
LADY IS TRYING TO DERAIL THE
HERMAN CAIN TRAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> GINGER WHITE, A SINGLE MOTHER
FROM ATLANTA SAYS THAT SHE HAD A
13-YEAR-LONG AFFAIR WITH THE
MARRIED REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.
>> IT'S ANOTHER CASE OF HE
SAID/SHE SAID.
>> NOW TECHNICALLY I BELIEVE
WE'RE NOW UP TO HE SAID/SHE
SAID/SHE SAID/SHE SAID/SHE
SAID/SHE WAS PAID NOT TO SAY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, THIS IS...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS IS DEVASTATING.
BECAUSE OF THIS, THE FORMER
GODFATHER'S PIZZA C.E.O. IS
CONSIDERING THE UNTHINKABLE.
CAIN SAYS HE'S GOING TO SPEND A
FEW DAYS OFF REASSESSING HIS
CANDIDACY.
WE COULD LOSE HIM!
HERMAN, DON'T YOU LEAVE THIS
ELECTION LOVER'S PIZZA HALF
BAKED.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SAYING THIS NOT JUST AS A
SUPPORTER BUT AS A BROADCASTER.
I NEED YOU IN THE RACE!
DON'T LEAVE ME WITH HIM!
(LAUGHTER)
HE BRINGS BOARD GAMES!
AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO
LEAVE!
A 13-YEAR AFFAIR JUST PROVES YOU
CAN CARRY ON A STABLE
RELATIONSHIP!
(LAUGHTER)
TWO COUNTING YOUR MARRIAGE!
BESIDES, YOU'VE RIDDEN OUT THE
STORM OVER ACCUSATIONS LIKE
THIS: .
>> HE SUDDENLY REACHED OVER AND
HE PUT HIS HAND ON MY LEGS,
UNDER MY SKIRT AND REACHED FOR
MY GENITALS.
HE ALSO GRABBED MY HEAD AND
BROUGHT IT TOWARDS HIS CROTCH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ROUGH
STUFF.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THIS NEW WOMAN SAYS THE
AFFAIR WAS CONSENSUAL.
I'D SAY THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, COMPARED TO ALL THAT
REACHING FOR THE LADY PARTS LIKE
A DACHSHUND GOING AFTER A BALL
UNDER THE COUCH THESE NEW
ALLEGATIONS SOUND LIKE LEAVE IT
TO... LET'S NOT SAY BEAVER.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> SHE SAYS HE WOULD FLY HER TO
CITIES WHERE HE WAS SPEAKING AND
LAVISH HER WITH GIFTS.
>> HE MADE IT VERY INTRIGUING.
>> Stephen: GREAT!
THAT'S A PLUS!
IT REMINDS EVERYONE HOW
INTRIGUING HERMAN CAIN IS.
♪ AMERICA... ♪
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, YES.
THAT'S THE STUFF RIGHT THERE.
MR. CAIN, YOU CAN TOTALLY BOUNCE
BACK FROM THIS AND BE THE
FRONT-RUNNER AGAIN BECAUSE IF
THESE ALLEGATIONS PROVE TRUE,
THAT MEANS YOU ARE ONLY ONE
EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR BEHIND N
