WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY!
WE'RE HERE TALKING TO VINCEGILLIGAN THE CREATOR OF
"BREAKING BAD" ABOUT LAST NIGHTAND THE ENTIRE SERIES.
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS,--AGAIN, SPOILER ALERT-- ONE OF
THE GREAT THINGS THAT WALT DOESTO SKYLER IS "I DID IT FOR ME."
WHY DOES THAT SEEM LIKE THENICEST THING HE HAS SAID TO HIS
FAMILY ALL FIVE SEASONS?
>> I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WORST THINGSHE'S DONE IN THIS SHOW IS LIE TO
THEM SO MUCH AND DESTROY THEFAMILY THROUGH LIES AS WELL AS
ACTION.
AND TO DO HIS WIFE THE COURTESYOF BEING HONEST, TO SHOW HER
THAT RESPECT ONCE AT LEASTBEFORE IT'S ALL OVER.
>> Stephen: IS THAT THING WHENHE SAYS "I DID IT FOR ME," IS
THAT NECESSARILY A BAD THING ORA BAD MOTIVATION?
BECAUSE, I MEAN, I DO THIS FORME.
(LAUGHTER)DON'T YOU DO YOUR SHOW FOR YOU?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IS THE SHOW YOURBLUE METH?
>> THE SHOW IS -- YOU KNOW, THESHOW IS MY BLUE METH AND NOW I
NEED TO BE IN SOME SORT OF12-STEP RECOVERY PROGRAM BECAUSE
IT'S OVER.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: THE FAME OF THELAST EPISODE WAS CALLED "FELINA"
FROM MARTY ROBBINS HIT♪ DOWN IN THE WEST TEXAS TOWN OF
EL PASO, I FELL IN LOVE WITH AMEXICAN GIRL ♪
HE HAS TO COME BACK BECAUSE THEBAD GUYS HAVE CAPTURED HIS
GIRLFRIEND-- OR THE AUTHORITIESHAVE-- TO DRAW HIM BACK AND HE
COMES BACK FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND INTHE SONG KNOWING HE'S GOING TO
DIE.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WALT COMES BACK.
DOES HE COME BACK FOR JESSE, TOSAVE HIM?
OR IS HE COMING BACK FOR THEBLUE METH?
IS THE BLUE METH HIS GIRLFRIEND?
>> I THINK -- TO USE "LORD OFTHE RINGS" TERMS --
>> Stephen: PLEASE.
PLEASE.
>> I THINK HE'S COMING BACK FORHIS PRECIOUS AND HIS PRECIOUS IS
THE BLUE METH IN THE LAB, THELAB HE CONSTRUCTED.
WHEN HE COMES BACK, I THINK HE'SCOMING BACK TO SET THINGS RIGHT
FINANCIALLY FOR HIS FAMILY ANDAFTER THAT HE JUST WANTS TO WIPE
OUT UNCLE JACK AND HIS GANG ANDHE REALIZES IN THE HOUR-- IN
THIS FINAL HOUR-- THAT JESSE ISSTILL ALIVE AND HE WANTS TO WIPE
OUT JESSE, TOO.
BUT IN OTHER WONDERFUL WESTERNTERMS, IT'S A BIT LIKE THE END
OF "THE SEARCHERS."
ALL THROUGHOUT "THE SEARCHERS"JOHN WAYNE IS CHASING AFTER
NATALIE WOOD'S CHARACTER ANDSHE'S BEEN TAKEN BY THE
COMANCHES AND HE KEEPS SAYING"WHEN I FIND HER, I'M GOING TO
KILL HER."
AND AT THE LAST MINUTE WHEN HECEASE HER HE SWEEPS HER UP IN
HIS ARMS AND SAYS "LET'S GOHOME."
AND IT'S A TEAR JERKINGWONDERFUL ENDING AND WE STOLE
FROM THE BEST.
>> Stephen: VINCE, THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR COMING.
I KNOW YOU CAME HERE, LIKE --YOU FLEW OUT FIRST THING IN THE
MORNING AFTER -- DID YOU PARTYALL NIGHT?
>> I PARTIED UNTIL ABOUTMIDNIGHT.
I'M A LITTLE -- LITTLE -- ALITTLE TIRED TODAY BUT I FLY --
I'D FLY 10,000 MILES FOR YOU,STEPHEN.
