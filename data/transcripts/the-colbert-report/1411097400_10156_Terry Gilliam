THAT NEED THEM. IN YOUR MOVIESLIKE "BRAZIL" AND "12 MONKEYS"
AND IN THIS ONE CALLED "THE ZERO

>> STEPHEN: WILL I BE ASADDER, BUT WISER MAN?
>> WIDER, SADDER, BUT WHEN YOUREFLECT ON IT LATER, YOU WILL
REALIZE YOU SAW TRUTH ANDYOU'RE A MAN WHO BELIEVES IN
TRUTH.
>> STEPHEN: I BELIEVE IN MYTRUTH (LAUGHTER)
MY TRUTH IS IS THE TRUTH THAT IWISH TO BE TRUE, NOT WHAT
THE FACTS SUPPORT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE SADDER ANDWISER, I WANT TO BE HAPPIER AND
DUMBER.
>> NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY IHAVE RENOUNCED MY AMERICAN
CITIZENSHIP.
>> STEPHEN: BECAUSE YOU DON'TWANT TO BE A HAPPY IDIOT?

I THINK YOU PUT IT BEAUTIFULLY(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T NEED TO SAYANYTHING. (APPLAUSE)

CORPORATIONS.

>> STEPHEN: TELL THE PEOPLEWATCHING THIS GREAT VIACOM
PROGRAM WHY CORPORATIONS ARE BADRIGHT NOW.

BUT THIS ONE MAKES ME LOOK HAPPYTO SEE YOU.
(LAUGHTER)IN THE MOVIE, CHRIS OWNS --
>> HE OWNS NOTHING.
HE'S A MAN WHO WORKS FOR ACORPORATION.
HE'S INCREDIBLY SKILLED AT THECOMPUTER ACTIVITY.
>> STEPHEN: I THOUGHT HE WASPLAYING TWO PIANOS AT ONCE.
>> HE CAN DO THAT AS WELL.
HE'S AN ACTOR, A CHARACTER ANDBRILLIANT PIANIST IN PRIVATE
LIFE.
BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUTTHAT.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE.
HE'S A COMPUTER GENIUS AND HEHAS A TASK OF SOLVING THE ZERO
THEOREM TO PROVE EVERYTHING ISMEANINGLESS.
ALL IS NOTHING.
>> STEPHEN: MAYBE NOTHING ISALL.
>> GLASS HALF FULL, HALF EMPTY.
>> STEPHEN: MAYBE HALF FULL.
MAYBE FULL OF URINE AND YOUWOULDN'T WANT TO DRINK IT
(LAUGHTER)>> YES.
BUT THAT'S HIS TASK.
THE PROBLEM IS HE'S ANTISOCIAL.
HE'S NOT A SOCIAL NETWORKER.
HE TRIES TO DISCONNECT FROM THATAND WORK AT HOME LIKE SO MANY OF
US DREAM OF.
>> STEPHEN: IS THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL?
DO YOU LIKE PEOPLE, TERRY?
>> WHAT I LIKE TO CALL IS POSTOR PRE-POST AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL.
PRE-POST-AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL.
IS THAT ON THE ASPERGER'S SCALE?
(LAUGHTER)>> THERE YOU GO.
AS A DIRECTOR, I HAVE TOIDENTIFY WITH MY MAIN CHARACTER.
OTHER WISE, HOW CAN YOU ANSWERTHE QUESTIONS.
DURING THE MOVIE, WE LAUGHED ALOT AND MADE JOKES.
IN THE END, I FOUND I HAD BECOMETHE CHARACTER CHRISTOPH PLAYED
SO BRILLIANTLY IN THE FILM.
I LOVE MY COMPUTER.
MY WIFE HAS BEGUN TO QUESTION MYSEXUALITY.
>> STEPHEN: THAT OUTFITDOESN'T HELP.
(LAUGHTER)>> HER OSHKOSH DUNGAREES, WE
BALANCE.
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR MEN TODISCOVER THEIR FEMININITY AND
WOMEN TO DISCOVER THEIRMASCULINITY. THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH IT IF YOU'RECONFIDENT.
>> STEPHEN: AS LONG AS YOUHAVE A SAFE WORD.
PUMPKIN PATCH, TERRY.
PUMPKIN PATCH.
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUSH YOUHERE.
>> STEPHEN: YOU'RE NOT PUSHINGME AT ALL., I'M UNPUSHABLE.
MY CHI IS SO STRONG I CAN'T BEPUSHED.
>> THE POINT IS WILL YOU AND CANYOU BE COMFORTABLE WEARING
WOMEN'S CLOTHING?
>> STEPHEN: TERRY, I WISH IHAD TIME TO SHOW YOU.
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WEARINGWOMEN'S CLOTHING.
>> 811, TRIBECA GRAND HOTEL.TALK TO YOU LATER
