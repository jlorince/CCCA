>> Stephen: WELLING COMEBACK, EVERYBODY NATION, YOU
KNOW ME.
WHEN THE SHARKS OF THELIBERAL MEDIA ARE CIRCLING
THEIR PREY I DON'T HEAD TOSHORE.
I GET A BIGGER BOAT.
THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
SLARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK,SHARK, SHARK.
>> FOLKS, THIS WEEK HELPLESSCHUM WASHINGTON POST
COLUMNIST AND HOMELESSCOLONEL SANDERS.
JIM?
>> "WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNNIPD RICHARD COHEN FINDS
HIMSELF AT THE CENTRE OF ANINTERNET FIRESTORM FOLLOWING
HIS COMMENTS ABOUT NEW YORKMAYOR PHIL DE BLASIO'S
MULTIRAISE FAMILY.
HE WROTE QUOTE TODAY'S GOPIS NOT RACIST, THEN GOES ON
TO SAY PEOPLE WITHCONVENTIONAL VIEWS MUST
REPRESS A GAG REFLEX WHENCONSIDERING THE MAYOR ELECT
OF NEW YORK.
A WHITE MAN MARRIED TO ABLACK WOMAN WITH TWO
BIRACIAL CHILDREN.
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY, IJUST HAD A CONVENTIONAL
REACTION.
NOW FOLKS, LET'S BE CLEAR.
COHEN IS SPECIFICALLY SAYINGTODAY'S GOP IS NOT RACIST.
THEREFORE IT'S NOT RACIST TOGAG WHEN YOU SEE AN
INTERRACIAL COUPLE.
A RACIST WOULD ACTUALLYTHROW UP ON THEM.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE
THROWING RICE AT A WEDDING,SOMETIMES IT ACTUALLY IS
RICE.
BUT OF COURSE THE INSANESCREAM B BLEEDIA, DOESN'T
GET IT.
THEY'RE TEARING INTO COHENLIKE A MOKO CHOMPING DOWN ON
AN WALRUS.
THEY HAVE CALLED COHEN'SWORK RACIST OP ED COLUMNS
GROTESQUE AND CALLED HIM APOWER WORSHIPPING BIGOT,
HORRIBLY RACIST AND STOPTHIS MAN BEFORE HE WRITES
SOMETHING AGAIN.
FOLKS, THAT, THAT-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THAT IS NO DIFFERENTTHAN A LYNCH MOB IS WHAT I
WOULD SAY IF I WERE RACIALLYINSENSITIVE.
WHICH I'M NOT.
AND NEITHER IS RICHARD COHEN.
BECAUSE YESTERDAY HERESPONDED BY SAYING WHAT I
WAS DOING WAS EXPRESSING NOTMY OWN VIEWS BUT THOSE OF
EXTREME RIGHT WINGREPUBLICAN TEA PARTY PEOPLE.
SEE, HE IS SAYING THATREPUBLICANS ARE RACIST, NOT
HIM.
AND REMEMBER, IN THE COLUMNHE SAID THAT REPUBLICANS
SPECIFICALLY ARE NOTRACISTS.
SO EVERYBODY SHOULD BEHAPPY.
AND I'M SURE HE'S WELL AWARETHAT POLLS SAY 87% OF
AMERICAN AS PROVE OFINTERRACIAL MARRIAGE.
BUT THAT'S WITH A MARGIN OFERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS-- PLUS
I HAVE EVIDENCE THAT RICHARDCOHEN IS NOT A RACIST, AFTER
SEEING 12 YEARS OF-- ONNOVEMBER 4TH HE WROTE IN HIS
COLUMN I SOMETIMES THINK IHAVE SPENT YEARS UNLEARNING
WHAT I LEARNED EARLIER IN MYLIFE.
SLAVERY WAS NOT A BENIGNINSTITUTION IN WHICH MOSTLY
BENEVOLENT WHITES OWNEDINNOCENT AND GRATEFUL BLACKS.
OKAY, RICHARD COHEN HASKNOWN THE SLAVERY WAS BAD
FOR AT LEAST SEVEN DAYS.
(LAUGHTER)AND FOR THE RECORD,
TUESDAY'S COLUMN WASN'T JUSTABOUT RACE, SOME OF IT WAS
ABOUT HOMOPHOBIA BECAUSE HEADDED THE PARENTHETICAL
SHOULD I MENTION THAT BILLDE BLASIO'S WIFE USED TO BE
A LESBIAN?
PROBABLY NOT.
(LAUGHTER)SO IT'S A GOOD THING YOU
DIDN'T.
IT WAS PARENTHETICAL.
AND NOTHING YOU SAY BETWEENPARENTHESES COUNTS.
WATCH.
SHOULD I MENTION THATRICHARD COHEN SYMPATHIZED
WITH GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AFTERTRAYVON MARTIN'S DEATH?
SHOULD I MENTION THATRICHARD COHEN ONCE SUGGESTED
THAT IT'S OKAY TO KEEP BLACKCUSTOMERS OUT OF YOUR STORE?
SHOULD I MENTION THAT IFRICHARD COHEN ISN'T A RACIST,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS?
MAYBE JUST A REALLY BADWRITER?
AND PLEASE-- (APPLAUSE)
PLEASE, I DO NOT WANT ANYONEATTACKING ME FOR SAYING
THOSE THINGS.
THAT'S JUST THE CONVENTIONALREACTION TO RICHARD COHEN.
