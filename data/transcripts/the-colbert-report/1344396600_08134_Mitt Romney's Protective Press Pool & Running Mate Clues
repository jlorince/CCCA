SOMEONE YELLING "STROKE." (LAUGHTER) NATION, STAY STRONG.
STAY STRONG.
NATION, THE LAME STREAM MEDIA IS IN THE TANK FOR BARACK OBAMA.
DO YOU EVER NOTICE HOW THEY KEEP CALLING HIM PRESIDENT?
BIAS MUCH.
NOW NOTHING ROMNEY DOES WOULD SEEM TO PLEASE THEM.
FOR PETE'S SAKE HE JUST TOOK THEM TO EUROPE FOR A WEEK AND ANSWERED OVER TWO OF THEIR QUESTIONS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW BY ALL RIGHTS, FOLKS, ROMNEY SHOULD JUST SHUT THE DOOR ON THESE CLOWNS.
BUT BEING THE BIGGER MAN, THIS WEEK MITT DECIDED TO ALLOW WHAT IS KNOWN AS A PROTECTIVE POOL IN
WHICH AT LEAST ONE REPORTER IS ALLOWED TO MONITOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THE CANDIDATE DOES
THAT'S RIGHT.
UNPRECEDENTED WALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE OF THE REAL MITT ROMNEY.
WARNING: IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION OR ARE PREGNANT, GO AHEAD AND WATCH.
(LAUGHTER) AND THIS ACCESS IS ALREADY TELLING US SO MUCH ABOUT THIS REGULAR GUY.
>> FIRST OFF, MITT ROMNEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOING FOR SOME AVERAGE JOE APPEAL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
EARLY TODAY.
ROMNEY PICKED UP IN A LOCAL HARDWARE STORE...
>> GOVERNOR, WHAT'D YOU BUY?
>> HARDWARE STUFF.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THERE.
ALL RIGHT?
HE BOUGHT HARDWARE STUFF.
YOU KNOW, HANLER THINGS, NAILY DOODADS, THOSE MEDAL GOODIES.
CLEARLY MITT ROMNEY IS A MAN OF THE... WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE?
PEOPLE-MAJIGS.
NOW YOUR HARD NOSE WILL McAVOY TYPES WILL SAY THIS IS JUST MINDLESS CAMPAIGN PHOTO FLUFF TO
RUN OUT THE CLOCK UNTIL THE CONVENTIONS.
WRONG!
BECAUSE THEN MITT WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE.
>> WHAT'D YOU GET?
>> GROCERIES.

>> Stephen: (LAUGHS) NICE TRY, PRESS.
SEE, THEY WERE TRYING TO GET MID-TO SPIEL THE BEANS ON WHO HE'S GOING TO PICK AS HIS
RUNNING MATE.
THE V.P. PICK IS ALL IMPORTANT,
FOLKS, WE ALL REMEMBER F.D.R.'S VICE PRESIDENT JOHN NANTZ GARDNER WHO SAID HIS ROLE "WAS
NOT WORTH A BUCKET OF WARM PISS." (LAUGHTER) THAT MAY SOUND BAD BUT REMEMBER,
THIS WAS THE DEPRESSION.
A BUCKET OF WARM PISS WAS THEIR IPAD.
(LAUGHTER) NOW THE V.P. CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
IN 2008, IT WAS MAVERICK ELECTION OF SARAH PALIN THAT HELPED JOHN McCAIN CLINCH
ANOTHER TERM IN THE SENATE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW WHO ROMNEY WILL PICK.
WELL, NOW THERE'S A NEW WAY FOR US TO FIGURE IT OUT.
>> IF THE PAST IS ANY INDICATION HOW WE WILL LEARN OF MITT
ROMNEY'S CHOICE, PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST LOOK TO WIKIPEDIA BECAUSE THE DAY BEFORE SARAH PALIN WAS
NAMED AS JOHN McCAIN'S RUNNING MATE HER WIKIPEDIA PAGE WAS UPDATED 68 TIMES.
>> Stephen: 68 TIMES!
WELL, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
CONSIDERING THAT ONCE SHE WAS ON THE TICKET SHE DID NOT EDIT HERSELF ONCE.
(LAUGHTER) SO THE NUMBER OF TIMES A WIKIPEDIA PAGE HAS BEEN EDITED PREDICTS THE CHANCES FOR V.P.
SLOT.
FOLKS, THAT MEANS WE COULD BE LOOKING AT VICE PRESIDENT SEASON SIX OF "BUFFFY THE VAMPIRE
SLAYER." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO NATION, LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD IN THIS HISTORIC DECISION.
GO ON WIKIPEDIA AND MAKE AS MANY EDITS AS POSSIBLE TO YOUR FAVORITE V.P. CONTENDER.
NOW, I LIKE FRIEND OF THE SHOW TIM PAWLENTY SO TO UP HIS CHANCES I'M GOING TO GET ON THE
OLD WIKIPEDIA TO PUMP UP HIS EDIT COUNT.
LET'S SEE HERE.
LET'S SEE HERE.
LET'S SEE HERE.
T-PAW WAS BORN IN ST. PAUL,
MINNESOTA.
LET'S EDIT THAT TO THE MINNESOTA TOWN OF ST. PAUL IS WHERE BORN TIM PAWLENTY WAS.
(LAUGHTER) HE WAS THE SON OF EUGENE JOSEPH PAWLENTY AND LET'S SAY MRS. BUTTERWORTH.
(LAUGHTER) INTENDING TO BECOME A DENTIST,
PAWLENTY STARTED HIS CAREER IN SANTA'S WORKSHOP.
(LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT AM I DOING?
THIS IS WIKIPEDIA.
ANYTHING YOU TYPE IN HERE BECOMES REALITY.
ON AUGUST 10, 2012, TIM PAWLENTY WAS NAMED MITT ROMNEY'S RUNNING MATE AND WIKI, WIKI, WIKI.
WITH (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO I HAVE DESIGNATED T-PAW THE V.P. PICK BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
STAY THAT WAY, FOLKS.
YOU GET ON WIKIPEDIA AND EDIT ANY OF THESE GUYS' PAGES TO GIVE THEM THE EDGE OR MAYBE EDIT THE
PAGE OF MORE OF A DARK HORSE-- LIKE MITT ROMNEY'S DARK HORSE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
