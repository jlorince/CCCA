>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW ANY, I MEAN ANY DOG CAN ATTACK THE PAPERBOY BUT AN ALPHA DOG WILL CUT HIS BRAKE CABLES.
THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW I RARELY PAY ATTENTION TO NEWS FROM SPAIN, PAELLA GUIDI, TRAMPLED BY A PACK OF WOLVES, WHAT IS
THERE TO KNOW.
LIKE MANY OF YOU IS WITH INTRIGUED BY THIS RECENT PIECE OF NEWS FROM THE SMALL TOWN OF BORJA.
>> IN SPAIN A CENTURY OLD ART FRESCO OF CHRIST WAS IN NEED OF REPAIR SO AN AMATEUR ART RESTORE NEVER OUR 80s
TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO TRY TO FIX IT.
>> HERE'S THE FRESCO BY THE 19th CENTURY ARTIST ELIAS GARCIA MARTINEZ BEFORE, AND AFTER THE PATCHUP JOB.
>> Stephen: I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
(LAUGHTER) WHICH ONE DID THE OLD LADY PAINT?
IS IT THE NATURALLISTIC PORTRAIT OF THE SON OF GOD EVOKING THE AGONY OF THE PASSION OR THE DOE FACED HOW
MANY UJ-- HOW MANY UNG LUS BOTH HAVE THEIR CHARM.
HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED SHE SPOTTED A WORK OF ART IN DISREPAIR AND SHOWED A CERTAIN CAN-DO ATTITUDE ABOUT THINGS SHE CLEARLY
CANNOT DO.
NOW YOU MIGHT SAY MY KID COULD PAINT THAT.
BUT NOT IF YOUR KID HAS EVER SEEN A HUMAN FACE.
(LAUGHTER) THIS ALPHA DOG WASN'T AFRAID TO LEAVE HER MARK ON THE ART WORLD, EVEN THOUGH A LOCAL FOUNDATION HAD JUST RECEIVED
A DONATION FROM THE PAINTERS GRANDDAUGHTER TO RESTORE THE ORIGINAL FRESCO.
A PROFESSIONAL RESTORES ARE SO LITERAL.
WHEREAS THIS REINTERPRETATION REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL CHRIST'S SUFFERING.
I KNOW EVERY TIME I SEE IT I SAY TO MYSELF, JESUS!
(LAUGHTER) AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO FINDS THIS ALPHA FIDO FRESCO BEST IN SHOW.
>> THE BOTCHED PAINT JOB MAY NOT BE SUCH A BAD THING AFTER RAUCHLT IT'S MORE POPULAR THAN EVER.
>> THE PAINTING'S VALUE HAS GONE FROM SENTIMENTAL TO BEING SO POPULAR CROWDS HAVE TO BE KEPT BACK.
>> Stephen: IT IS SO POPULAR DAN BROWN IS WRITING A BOOK ABOUT IT.
ANGELS & DEMONS AND WHATEVER THE HELL THIS IS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FOLKS T IS THE LATEST ON THIS SHAGGY JESUS STORY THAT MAKES MRS. GIMENEZ THE TRUE ALPHA.
>> THIS MORNING TO THAT BOTCHED RESTORATION OF AN EARLY 20th CENTURY PAINTING OF JESS U THE SPANISH WOMAN
WHO TRIED TO FIX THE PAINTING IS NOW SUING THE CHURCH.
THE 80-YEAR-OLD LOCAL ARTIST SAYS THE CHURCH OWNERS ARE CHARGING VISITORS NOW AND SHE DESERVES ROYALTIES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THAT TAKES ALPHA BALLS.
THAT'S LIKE HIJACKING A PLANE AND THEN DEMANDING FREQUENT-FLIER MILES.
SO FOR TURNING THAT LOVELY FRESCO INTO A PILE OF SHIT-TZU AND THEN DEMANDING
