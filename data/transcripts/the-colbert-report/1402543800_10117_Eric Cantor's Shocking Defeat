HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR VOTED OUT OF OFFICE
SENDING SHOCK WAVES THROUGH WASHINGTON AND THE COUNTRY.
>> THE STUNNING ELECTIONROCKING WASHINGTON
NO ONE SAW IT COMING.
>> Stephen: YES NO ONE SAWCOMING  LEAST OF ALL ERIC CANTOR
WHO HELPED CREATE THE TEA PARTY
BY STITCHING TOGETHER DEADIDEAS
AND THEN FILLING THEM WITH RAGE GIVING IT A JOLT OF POWER AND
LETTING IT LOOSE ON THE COUNTRYSIDE TERRIFIED OF FIRE
AND SCIENCE.
I MEAN, WHO -- WHO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WHO COULD EVER IMAGINE IT WOULD COME BACK TO
KILL ITS CREATOR.
WHO KNOWS WHO IT WILL DEVOUR NEXT.
DADDY LOVES YOU, TEA PARTY.ERIC BAD, STEPHEN GOOD.

NOW, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, TEA PARTY, THAT THE CANDIDATE YOU
CHOSE IS SOMEONE I BACKED SINCE DAY ONE IF YOU STARTED COUNTING
TODAY.
>> CANTOR, SEVEN TERMS AS THE INCUMBENT LOST THE VIRGINIA
PRIMARY TO TEA PARTY BACKEDECONOMICS PROFESSOR, DAVID BRAT.
>> THE SITTING HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER LOSING IN A PRIMARY IN
HIS OWN PARTY TO A HERETOFORE OBSCURE COLLEGE PROFESSOR NAMED
DAVE BRAT WHO A MAN'S WIKIPEDIAPAGE  WAS ABOUT TWO LINES.
>> NOT ANY MORE.
OK HERE WE GO.
>> Stephen: LET'S EDIT THAT PAGEA  LITTLE BIT.
BRAT HAS ENJOYED THE LONG-TIME SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP OF
STEPHEN COLBERT WHO WAS THE BESTMAN AT HIS WEDDING AND WHO
FUTURE PRESIDENT BRAT, PLANS TO APPOINT AS AMBASSADOR TO
BIKINITOWN AND WIKI-TRUE.
ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: OF COURSE I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU GOOD PEOPLE THAT BRAT IS AN ECONOMICS
PROFESSOR AT RANDOLPH MACON COLLEGE.
GO FIGHTING HYPHENS.
AND HE IS A GREAT TEACHER.
REVIEWERS ON RATE MY PROFESSOR DOT-COM HAVE NOTED THAT HE'S
TOTAL EYE CANDY.
HE'S SO CHARMING YOU FORGET TO BE MAD AT HIM AND
AT LEAST HE'S HOT.
YES, HE IS.
I WOULDN'T KICK HIM OUT OF BED FOR KICKOMG MEXICANS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY.
NOW IN A STRANGE TWIST, BRAT'S DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT WILL BE JACK
TRAMMELL.
ANOTHER PROFESSOR AT RANDOLPH MACON. I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THAT COLLEGE BUTALL OF THEIR PROFESSORS SEEM
TO BE LOOKING FOR OTHER JOBS.
MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THISECONOMICS  PROFESSOR IS HE
WON WITHOUT ECONOMICS.
>> CANTOR SPENT 50 TIMES MORETHAN  BRAT. FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS IN CAMPAIGN ADS WHILEBRAT SPENT BARELY $100,000.
>> HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN SPENTMORE AT STEAK HOUSES ALONE THAN
HIS OPPONENT DAVE BRAT SPENT ONHIS OPPONENT'S CAMPAIGN.
>> HE GOT CHUCKED WHILE EATINGCHUCK. HE GOT DETHRONED WHILE
EATING A T-BONE. HE WENT DOWNON THE GROUND ROUND.
HE SAID GOODBYE WHILE EATING ARIBEYE. HE GOT ELECTORALLY
WHIPPED WHILE EATING NEW YORKSTRIP  HE WAS WAYLAYED EATING
FILLET. HIT IN THE GROIN WITH A TENDERLOIN. HE WAS SPANKED
WITH THE FLANK...STEAK. POORHOUSE, PORTERHOUSE.
LONDON BROIL.
STEAK AU POIVRE.
DRY RUB.
NO, NO, NO.
NOW HERE'S MAY BEEF WITH CANTOR -- NO!
NATION, HERE'S THE DEAL.
AS A FORMER SUPER PAC, SUPER PLAYER WHO RAISED CASH FOR LET'S
SAY POLITICAL STUFF, I'M PERSONALLY OFFENDED THE MAN WITH
LESS MONEY WON.
IF VIOLATES THE GOLDEN RULE OF POLITICS.
HE WHO HAS THE GOLD -- AND THAT'S  THE END OF THE RULE
BUT THE  EVANGELICAL DAVE BRATGOT ONE  IMPORTANT ENDORSEMENT.
>> THE REASON WE WON THE CAMPAIGN AND THERE'S ONE REASON
IT'S BECAUSE DOLLARS DO NOTVOTE, YOU DO.
THE MIRACLE THAT JUST HAPPENED, THIS IS A MIRACLE FROM GOD THAT
JUST HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: YES, BRAT'S VICTORY WAS A MIRACLE FROM GOD.
HEAR THAT ONLY JEWISH REPUBLICANIN CONGRESS?
OH, OH, SO CLOSE.
YOU WERE JUST ONE JESUS SHORT.
OF COURSE, NOW THAT CANTOR IS OUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMEONE
TO APPEAL TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
LOOKING AT YOU, LOUIE GOHMERTOR SHOULD I SAY LOUIS GOHMBERG.
LET'S CALL A MOHEL ANDCIRCUMCISE THAT HEAD.
AND CANTOR'S LOSS WASN'T JUSTUNEXPECTED, FOLKS. IT WASN'T
JUST UNPRECEDENTED, IT WAS UNEXPRECTEDENTED.
>> ERIC CANTOR IS THE FIRSTHOUSE MAJORITY LEADER SINCE
THAT ROLE WAS CREATED IN 1899 TOLOSE THAT JOB.
>> ERIC CANTOR WAS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE NEXT
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: BUT NOW IT'S CANTORRIDES IN THE SUNSET WHILE
JOHN BOEHNER REMAINS THE SUNSET.
AND CANTOR'S DOWNFALL.
FOLKS, ERIC CANTOR'S DOWNFALL, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE WRONG IN
AMERICA WAS THE IMMIGRANTS FAULT.
>> IMMIGRATION WAS A CENTRAL ISSUE IN VIRGINIA'S REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY. ERIC CANTOR WAS ACCUSED
OF RUSHING TOWARDS A REFORMPROGRAM HIS
OPPONENT LABELLED AMNESTY.
>> IT IS TIME TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGAL RESIDENTS
AND CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AS
CHILDREN ONE OF THE GREAT FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF OUR
COUNTRY WAS THAT CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THE MISTAKES
OF THEIR PARENTS.
>> Stephen: BOO!  NO COMPASSION FOR MEXI-CHILDREN.
FOLKS, I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY FITTING HIS MAN WAS DEFEATED ON
TACO TUESDAY.
SO LET THIS BE A LESSON.
LET THIS -- LET THIS BE A LESSONREPUBLICANS.
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HELPING LOS ILLEGALES BECAUSE NOT ONLY CAN
THE TEA PARTY SMELL FEAR THEY CAN SMELL CILANTRO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
