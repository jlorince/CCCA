>> STEPHEN: HEY, EVERYBODY!
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TOHAVE YOU WITH US!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")>> STEPHEN: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT!
THAT IS MY NAME!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, I THINK IF YOU GUYS
WEREN'T OUT THERE CHANTING MYNAME EVERY NIGHT, I'M NOT SURE I
WOULD KNOW WHO I WAS.
(CHEERING)FOLKS, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW.
YOU KNOW THAT AS A PATRIOT,THERE IS NOTHING I
LOVE MORE THAN CELEBRATING THEOVERTHROW OF THE BRITISH
MONARCHY AND TELLING KING GEORGEWHERE HE CAN STICK HIS CRUMPET!
AND AS AN IRISH AMERICAN WHOSEANCESTORS WERE DRIVEN WEST OF
THE RIVER SHANNON TO FARM ROCKS,I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUCKINGHAM
PALACE TURNED INTO A PUBLICURINAL FOR THE INDIGENT AND THE
INSANE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT ON THE OTHER HAND --
>> ANOTHER ROYAL BABY IS ON THEWAY.
>> ANOTHER ROYAL BABY IS ON THEWAY.
>> WE HAVE A SPARE TO THE HEIR.
>> THE HEIR AND THE SPARE.
>> IT'S AN HEIR AND A SPARE.
>> OH MY GOOOOOOOOOD!
AN HEIR AND SPARE!
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I CARE!
BUT I DO!
WE DID IT!
WELL, TECHNICALLY WILL AND KATEDID IT.
(LAUGHTER)SO MAGICAL.
IT'S A FAIRYTALE.
THE ROYALS ARE TRULY A SPECIALCLASS OF PEOPLE -- THEY MANAGED
TO HAVE SEX WITH A ONE-YEAR-OLDIN THE HOUSE!
(LAUGHTER)AND I WANT TO THANK THE HAPPY
COUPLE, BECAUSE THIS COULD NOTHAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME.
>> EBOLA, ISIS, SO MANY HORRIBLESTORIES GOING ON RIGHT NOW BUT
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE NEWSALL ABOUT SICKNESS AND TERROR
AND DEATH.
LET'S CELEBRATE LIFE.
>> IN THE INTEREST OF NOT ALLNEWS BEING NEGATIVE, A BIG ROYAL
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> SO MANY FOLKS HAVE BEENBUMMED OUT BY SOME DEPRESSING
NEWS.
WE BROUGHT YOU A PREGNANCY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS NEED.
JUST SOME HAPPY BABY NEWS.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH, SOME HAPPYNEWS!
HAPPY NEWS THAT MAKES YOU WANTTO PASS OUT CIGARS, RATHER THAN
SIMPLY PASS OUT.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, IT'S NOT ALL GOOD
NEWS.
BECAUSE "KATE IS SUFFERING FROMAN ACUTE FORM OF MORNING
SICKNESS" THAT FORCED THE ROYALS"TO ANNOUNCE THE PREGNANCY
BEFORE THE DUCHESS PASSED THESIGNIFICANT 12-WEEK MILESTONE."
YES, THE MORNING-SICKNESSSPECULATION.
WOULD HAVE BEEN RAMPANT -- ISSHE PREGNANT, OR DID SHE JUST
EAT ENGLISH FOOD?
(LAUGHTER)SO THANK YOU, PRINCE WILLIAM AND
DUCHESS KATE, FOR GIVING THEWHOLE WORLD A MUCH-NEEDED BREAK
FROM THE WHOLE WORLD.
(LAUGHTER)YOU DESERVE EVERY BIT OF THE
ATTENTION YOU'RE GETTING.
INSTEAD OF ME.
WHICH LEADS TO MY OWNANNOUNCEMENT -- I'M PREGNANT!
(CHEERING)I PEED ON THAT STICK LAST NIGHT
(CHEERING)I PEED ON THAT STICK LAST NIGHT
AND IT GOT WET, SO ITHINK THAT MEANS THIS IS A GO.
I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR ALONG I AM,BUT JUDGING BY THE SCALE, MY
BABY ALREADY WEIGHS EXACTLY THESAME AMOUNT AS LAST NIGHT'S
