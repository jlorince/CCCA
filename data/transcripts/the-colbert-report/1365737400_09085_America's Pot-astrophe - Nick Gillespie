[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MIGHT HAVE TO GET HIGH TO GET RELEVANT.
GOOD LUCK GETTING ANYONE TO SAY THAT ON TEAM HERE TO SAY THAT ON TV IS REASON.COM EDITOR AND
CHIEF NICK GILL DLRKS ESPIE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
HOW DID WE RUN UP THE WHITE FLAG IN THE WAR ON DRUGS?
NANCY REAGAN LOSES, CHEECH AND CHONG WIN.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
>> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WE GREW UP AS A COUNTRY.
ENOUGH OF US HAVE BEEN AROUND WHERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR WORST FRIEND, DO YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH
HIM WHEN HE IS HIGH OR DRUNK?
BEING HIGH ISN'T SO BAD -- COMPARED -- I'M SAYING HE NOT YOU.
BUT THAT'S PART OF IT.
POT HAS BEEN ILLEGAL SINCE THE 1930'S.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE OF REEFER MADNESS.
HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE?
IT'S A GATEWAY DRUG.
IT LEADS TO MURDER AND INTERRACIAL DATING.
>> THAT'S RIGHT AND BAD POT SMOKING.
PART OF IT IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN AFTER 70 YEARS EVERY ASPECT OF PROHIBITION MAKES THINGS WORSE.
IF DRUG PROHIBITION WORKED, THE MARKETS AROUND DRUGS WOULDN'T BE VIOLENT.
THEY ARE MORE VIOLENT THAN EVER.
IF YOU HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM YOU ARE SAYING TO PEOPLE YOU ARE A CRIMINAL AND ADDICT.
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR ADDICTS TO GET HELP NOW.
YOU WILL ALL THE WAR ON POT DOES WHICH IS THE ONLY ILLEGAL DRUG THAT ANYBODY USES IN REAL NUMBERS.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD OF METH?
WE'RE COOKING METH DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW.
METH LABS EVERYWHERE, RIGHT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S EVERYWHERE.
>> IT IS EVERYWHERE.
>> Stephen: IT'S A GATEWAY DRUG.
POT, METH, HEROIN, GAY.
IT'S A GAY-WAY.
>> VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER USED METH HAVE YOU EVER USED METH?
>> Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.
>> YOUR SHOW.
TWO TENTHS OF AMERICANS HAVE USED METH.
FOR POT IT'S 7% OR 8%.
MOST PEOPLE WHO USE POT IT'S LIKE DRINKING BEER.
THERE'S NO REASON FOR POT TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY.
>> Stephen: WE WERE SOLD MEDICAL MARIJUANA WITH THE EXPLICIT PROMISE THAT THIS WAS
NOT TO LEGALIZE IT FOR RECREATIONAL USE.
IT'S A BAIT AND SWITCH, BUDDY.
THEY GOT THE HOOK IN US, RIGHT.
>> COLORADO SAY GOOD STATE TO LOOK AT BECAUSE LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL POT FOR EVERYBODY.
IT HAD MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR A BETTER PART OF A DECADE.
POT IS GOOD MEDICINE DESPITE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS.
THEY CAN USE IT FOR.
>> Stephen: WE WERE TOLD IT WAS NOT RECREATIONAL MAR JUAN.
WHAT THE IS NEXT PROSTITUTION?
YOU ARE A LIBERTARIAN.
HOW ABOUT MEDICAL PROSTITUTION?
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE SEXUAL FEELING, BABY, SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT POT -- POT IS USED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: THEY ARE USED USERS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> IT'S NOT A FRINGE THING.
MANY NORMAL PEOPLE, MANY AVERAGE PEOPLE USE IT.
THEY USE IT RESPONSIBLY.
IT MAKES THEIR LIFE A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
IF WE TAKE AWAY THE PROHIBITION WE TAKE AWAY THE CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
>> Stephen: IF WE STOP MAKING IT ILLEGAL WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR PRIVATE PRISON INDUSTRY BECAUSE
THOSE PRISONS ARE FILLED WITH POT USERS AND THROWS GOOD INCARCERATION JOBS.
>> THIS IS WHERE RAND ST. PAUL AHEAD OF PRESIDENT.
HE IS SAYING WE NEED SENTENCING REFORM.
WE'VE FILLED THE STATE AND FEDERAL PRISONS WITH NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS.
WE KICK OUT VIOLENT PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE IN PRISON WHO ARE AN ACTUAL THREAT TO SOCIETY.
>> Stephen: WHAT HEROIN IS LEGAL AND WE'RE ALL STRUNG OUT, PLEASE COME BACK TO APOLOGIZE.
