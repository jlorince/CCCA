FOLKS, AND I NEED YOUR LOVE
BECAUSE FOLKS, THIS IS A
BITTER SWEET EVENING.
BECAUSE SATURDAY MARKS THE
END OF AN ERA.
THE ERA OF CARING WHOM MIKE
HUCKABEE IS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO IS THAT?
OH, THAT'S HUCKABEE.
FOLKS, THINK WE'LL ALL
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE WHEN
WE STOPPED CARING.
I WAS-- [BLEEP] WHERE WAS I.
I DON'T CARE.
DOESN'T MATTER.
ANYWAY, MIKE HUCKABEE WHO
JUST LAST WEEK WAS LEADING
IN MANY NATIONAL POLLS
PROMISED THAT ON SATURDAY
NIGHT HE WAS GOING TO
ANNOUNCE HIS PRESIDENTIAL
PLANS ON WHAT SOME CRITICS
HAVE CALLED HIS TELEVISION
SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I TUNED IN FOR
THE WHOLE THING AND OF
COURSE I ASSUMED HE WAS
RUNNING BECAUSE ON THE SHOW
HE WAS SO CLEARLY LAYING THE
GROUNDWORK FOR A
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BY
INTERVIEWING MARIO LOPEZ,
THEN JAMMING ON CAT SCRATCH
FEVER WITH TED NUDGE ENT.
I MEAN THIS-- NUG, NT.
I MEAN THIS SCREAMS--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I MEAN THIS
SCREAMS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
CLEARLY, CLEARLY MAKE THE
PUSSY PURR IS A METAPHOR FOR
OUR A DEND ENT-- DEPENDENCE
OIL OR ON FOREIGN PUSSIES.
EITHER WAY WE NEED TO
INCREASE DOMESTIC
PRODUCTION.
DRILL, BABY, DRILL!
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO I WAS SO
EXCITED.
FOLKS, I WAS BLINDSIDE WHEN
AT THE END OF HIS SHOW
HUCKABEE HUCKA SAID THIS.
>> I WILL NOT SEEK THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR
PRESIDENT THIS YEAR.
ALL THE FACTORS SAY GO.
BUT MY HEART SAYS NO.
>> Stephen: THE FACTORS SAY
GO BUT MY HEART SAYS NO.
WHY?
BECAUSE IT RHYMES?
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN
FIELD IS A MESS SO MY HEART
SAYS YES.
OR YOU'RE UP AGAINST PAW
LENTEE, HE'S A-- PAWLENTY,
HE'S A GRANDI, YOU'RE A
VENTI.
THEN IT HIT ME, I COULDN'T
FIGURE IT OUT, FOLKS, BUT
THEN HIT ME.
I KNOW WHERE HUCKABEE IS NOT
RUNNING ARE.
YOU SEE, FOUR YEARS AGO I
PUT THIS GUY ON THE MAP.
>> THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M
THE FRONT-RUNNER NOW IS
BECAUSE OF THE COLE BERT
BUMP-- COLBERT BUMP.
>> Stephen: I MADE MIKE
HUCKABEE.
YES, I MADE MIKE HUCKABEE.
ADMITTEDLY A BIT OF A RUSH
JOB.
THAT'S WHY HE CAME OUT SO
LUMPY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT FOLKS, WHAT
DOES STEPHEN GIVE US, THE
COLBERT TAKE AWAY.
ON MARCH OF THIS YEAR I PUT
MIKE HUCKABEE ON NOTICE AND
AT THAT MOMENT HUCKABEE KNEW
IT WAS HUCKAOVER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BECAUSE NO ONE
ON MY UNNOTICED BOARD HAS
EVER BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT.
NOT JANE FONDA.
NOT EVEN FLAVOR CRYSTALS.
NOBODY.
ANYWAY, NOW HE'S GONE.
FASTER THAN A GOP CANDIDATE
GETS A FOX NEWS SHOW.
AND AT THE END OF HIS SHOW,
HE GOT A VERY SPECIAL
MESSAGE FROM A FELLOW PERSON
ON TV.
>> MIKE HUCKABEE IS NOT
GOING TO BE RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY
HAPPY THAT HE WILL NOT BE
RUNNING ARE.
ESPECIALLY OTHER CANDIDATES.
SO MIKE, ENJOY THE SHOW.
YOUR RATINGS ARE TRAFFIC.
YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF
MONEY.
YOU'RE BUILDING A BEAUTIFUL
HOUSE IN FLORIDA.
GOOD LUCK.
>> Stephen: A TOUCHING
SENTIMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: MORE OF WHICH
YOU CAN FIND IN DONALD TRUMP'S
LINE OF SYMPATHY CARDS, I'M
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS, THAT
NEW BRICK PATIO IS SOMETHING
ELSE, REALLY TERRIFIC, TRUMP.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MAKES YOU THINK.
WHAT IS THAT?
I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLD
RIGHT NOW JUST TODAY THERE
HAS BEEN A HUGE DEVELOPMENT
IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
FOR MORE LET'S GO TO MY
COLLEAGUE CHRIS MATTHEWS.

STROKE.

PRESIDENT.

WHO, WHO IS GOING TO BREAK
THIS TO MEATLOAF?

PRESIDENT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: LOOK AT HIM.
SO FULL OF HOPES AND DREAMS
FOR THE FUTURE.
THE DREAM THAT ONE DAY THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES MIGHT ORDER HIM TO
SELL SUNTAN LOTION WITH GARY
BUSEY.
