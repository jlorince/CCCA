ONLY HOPE.
BUT AT LEAST, FOLKS, THERE
ARE SOME CELEBRITIES WE CAN
STILL LOOK UP TO THANKS TO
STORIES LIKE THIS.
>> JOHN MALKOVICH USUALLY
NOT CAST AS A HERO BUT IS
BEING CREDITED WITH HELPING
SAFE A MAN, REAL LIFE.
THE ACKER HELPED A
77-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO TRIPPED
ON THE SIDEWALK AND THEN
SLASHED HIS THROAT ON SOME
SCAFFOLDING.
WIDNESSES SAY THAT MALKOVICH
RAN OVER, APPLIED PRESSURE
TO THE MAN'S NECK AND WAITED
FOR AN AMBULANCE.
>> Stephen: TRULY HEROIC.
AND IT IS MALKOVICH SO
PROBABLY A LITTLE CREEPY.
AND HE IS NOT HOLLYWOOD'S
ONLY HERO.
>> THERE WAS NO SPECIAL
EFFECTS.
IT WAS THE REAL THING WHEN
ACTOR RYAN GOSLING CLUTCHED
A WOMAN FROM THE PATH OF A
SPEEDING TAXIST WHEN A
17-YEAR-OLD FLIPPED HIS
MUSTANG T WAS PATRICK
DEMPSEY TO THE RESCUE PRYING
THE BOY OUT.
>> DOES TIN HOFFMAN THE
LATEST HOLLYWOOD ACTOR TO
TURN HERO.
REPORTING HOFFMAN SAVED A
JOGGER'S LIFE IN LONDON'S
HYDE PARK.
>> SHE WAS THE ONE IN
DISTRESS, BUT WHEN
BILLIONAIRE RICHARD
BRANSON'S CARIBBEAN ESTATE
WENT UP IN FLAMES LAST
SUMMER T WAS WINSLET TO THE
RESCUE, VISITING SHE SWOOPED
UP HIS 90-YEAR-OLD MOTHER
AND CARRIED HER TO SAFETY.
>> I'M SO GLAD BRANSON'S MOM
GOT OUT.
HE WOULD HAVE CARRIED HER
HIMSELF BUT HIS BACK WAS
OCCUPIED.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS WITH ALL THESE
SUPER STAR SAVIOURS I'M
STARTING TO THINK THAT
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING
THEMSELVES IN DANGER JUST TO
MEET CELEBRITIES.
AND I WANT IN.
NOW ENDANGERING MY OWN LIFE
SEEMS LIKE THE EASIEST WAY
TO DO IT.
THAT IS JUST-- THE SIMPLEST
SOLUTION IS USUALLY TO SLICE
YOUR VEIN OPEN WITH A RAZOR
AND HOPE TO GET CARRIED TO
THE HOSPITAL BY HUGH
JACKMAN.
I LOVE YOU WOLVERINE.
