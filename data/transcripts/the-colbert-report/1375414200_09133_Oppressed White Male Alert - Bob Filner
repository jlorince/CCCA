FOLKS, THERE IS STARTLING NEW
INFORMATION
ON THE NSA SECRET SURVEILANCE
PROGRAMS IT TURNS OUT EVEN AS HE
WAS ON THE RUN,
SNOWDEN HAD TIME
TO STOP AND TAKE ANOTHER
LEAK.
SO LET'S GET INTO THE
NITTY-GRITTY DETAILS-- I'M
SORRY, I'M SORRY, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WE WILL HAVE TO
WAIT.
I'M GETTING AN OPPRESSED
WHITE MALE ALERT.
REPEAT.
I HAVE AN OPPRESSED WHITE
MALE ALERT.
TONIGHT'S VICTIM SAN DIEGO
MAYOR BOB FILLNER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: HE'S BEING
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL
HARASSINGMENT BY EIGHT
DIFFERENT WOMEN AS WELL AS
ANYONE LOOKING AT THIS
PICTURE RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THE DETAILS, THE DETAILS
ARE A LITTLE DISTURBING SO
IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN THE
ROOM, THEY'RE ABOUT TO GROW
UP REAL QUICK.
>> KISSING, GROPING, LEWD
COMMENT, SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
THOSE ARE THE ALLEGATIONS.
>> WORKERS REFER TO ONE OF
HIS ALLEGED MOs AS THE QUOTE
FILLNER HEAD LOCK.
>> HE PUTS HIS ARM AROUND
THEIR SHOULDER, PULLS IT IN
TIGHTER AROUND HER NECK,
OFTENTIMES PULLING CLOSE TO
THEIR FACE.
AND TELL THEM YOU'RE
WONDERFUL.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
I WANT TO KISS.
>> THE COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR
LISA CURTAIN SAID FILLNER
TOUCHED HER WEDDING BAND
DURING A MEETING AND WHAT
HAPPENED NEXT SHOCKED HER.
>> HE REACHED OVER TO KISS
ME.
I TURNED MY HEAD, AT THAT
MOMENT, AND ON THE SIDE OF
MY FACE I GOT A VERY WET,
SALIVA-FILLED KISS INCLUDING
HIS TONGUE ON MY CHEEK.
>> BOB FILLNER'S FORMER
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR SAYS
HE ASKED HER TO WORK WITHOUT
WEARING UNDERWEAR.
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY, THAT
SOUNDS BAD.
BUT WE HAVE NO REASON TO
THINK FILLNER WASN'T ALSO
WILLING TO WORK WORKIO
UNDERWEAR.
OKAY, THAT'S CALLED EQUAL
ACCESS.
WELL NOW COMMUNICATIONS
DIRECTOR IRENE McCORMACK
JACKSON HAS FILED A
HARASSMENT SUIT SAYING
FILLNER IS NOT FIT TO HOLD
ANY PUBLIC OFFICE THAT IS
OUTRAGEOUS.
IF HE IS FIT ENOUGH TO HOLD
A WOMAN HALF HIS AGE IN A
HEAD LOCK, I THINK HE'S FIT
ENOUGH TO HOLD PUBLIC
OFFICE.
NOW MAYOR FILLNER HAS
ALREADY EXPRESSED REGRET AND
TOLD UNIVISION SAN DIEGO
EXACTLY HOW HE FEELS.
>> I BROUGHT THIS ON THROUGH
MY OWN PERSONAL FRAILITIES.
AND THE BIGGEST MONSTER
RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW, IS
INSIDE ME.
>> Stephen: YES.
BOB FILLNER SAYS HE HAS THE
BIGGEST MONSTER INSIDE HIM.
ADDING WOULD YOU LIKE MY
LITTLE MONSTER INSIDE YOU?
WELL, BOB FILLNER IS NOT
TAKING THIS LYING DOWN OR
PINNED AGAINST THE OFFICE
SUPPLY ROOM DOOR.
HE IS FIGHTING BACK BY
POINTING OUT THAT HE IS THE
REAL VICTIM HERE.
>> FILLNER WANTS SAN DIEGO
TAXPAYERS TO PAY HIS LEGAL
FEES IN A LAWSUIT THAT ONE
OF THE WOMEN HAS FILED
AGAINST HIM.
>> AN ATTORNEY FOR EMBATTLED
SAN DIEGO MAYOR BOB FILLNER
IS BLAMING THE CITY FOR THE
MAYOR'S LEGAL TROUBLES.
HE SAYS THAT FILLNER NEVER
RECEIVED SEXUAL HARASSMENT
TRAINING, WHICH IS REQUIRED
BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
IT'S TRUE.
IT IS SAN DIEGO'S FAULT THAT
BOB FILLNER HARASSED THOSE
WOMEN BECAUSE HE WASN'T
PROPERLY TRAINED.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S THE SAME WAY IT WOULD
BE THEIR FAULT IF HE KILLED
SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY NEVER
PROVIDED DON'T MURDER
TRAINING.
AND FOLKS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
TRAINING.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED THIS SHOW MY PARENT
COMPANY VIACOM INFORMED ME I
HAVE TO PROVIDE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR MY
EMPLOYEES.
THEN AFTER SOME COMPLAINTS,
THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT HAD
TO BE ANTI-SEXUAL HARASSMENT
TRAINING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> OKAY, AGAIN, IT'S
COMPLICATED.
BUT NOW, FOLKS, I'M AN
EXPERT.
YOU COULD SAY I'M A BLACK
BELT IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I
WEAR THE BELT OTHERWISE MY
ROBE FALLS OPEN
