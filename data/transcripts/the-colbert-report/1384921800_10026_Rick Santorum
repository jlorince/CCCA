I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
YOU REALLY SEEM TO BE APPEALINGDIRECTLY TO THE HEART OF NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO WIN.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOUT
YOUR MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE MOSTRESPONDED TO?
>> SIMPLICITY.
THE POINT YOU JUST MADE.
PEOPLE WANT SOMEONE WHO WILL GOOUT HERE -- I TALKED TO PEOPLE
HERE TODAY WHO SAID "I DON'TBELIEVE IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU
BELIEVE IN BUT I BELIEVE YOUBELIEVE."
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT NEW MOVIESTUD SGLO
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> OKAY CO-LIGHT STUDIOS.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO FROMSOMEONE WHO IS A CULTURAL
WARRIOR CALLING OUT THE CRIMESOF HOLLYWOOD TO BEING PART OF
THE PROBLEM?
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> STOP CURSING THE DARKNESS ANDLIGHT A CANDLE AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING.
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING ABOUTWHAT HOLLYWOOD IS DOING WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE MOVIES THATREFLECT THE VALUES THAT I THINK
A LOT OF AMERICANS STILL HOLDAND BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FOR
OUR COUNTRY TO DO WELL GOINGFORWARD.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT A NEW MOVIE.
YEAH, GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT UPFOR GOING FORWARD.
THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THECHRISTMAS CANDLE."
AND IT'S A STORY OF A TOWN WITHA SET OF MIRACULOUS CANDLES.
>> NO, NOT REALLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
>> NOT REALLY.
>> Stephen: THERE'S NOMIRACULOUS CANDLE?
>> WELL, THERE'S A CANDLE THATHAVE BEEN BLESSED.
EVERY 25 YEARS AN ANGEL COMES TOTHIS TOWN AND BLESSES THE
CANDLE.
>> Stephen: JUST LIKE IT SAYS INTHE BIBLE.
>> NOT EXACTLY.
NOT EXACTLY.
BUT THIS CANDLE WAS GIVEN TOSOMEONE WHO IS IN NEED IN THE
COMMUNITY AND A MIRACLE HAPPENSON CHRISTMAS EVE TO THAT FAMILY.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY AND NOW--.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S NOT AMIRACULOUS AND CAN?
>> WELL, THE CANDLE IS NOTMIRACULOUS BUT THE PRAYER THAT
IS SAID -- THEY GIVE THEINSTRUCTIONS, LIGHT IT AND PRAY.
SO NOT THE CANDLE THAT GIVES THEMIRACLE BUT THE PRAYER.
AN ANSWER TO PRAYER THAT IS THEMIRACLE.
>> Stephen: I CAN ACCEPT THAT.
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.
>> WE'RE NOT -- IT'S NOT LIKEVOODOO STUFF.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: MIRACULOUS CANDLE
ISN'T VOODOO, IT'S CHANUKAH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'RE BOTH CATHOLICS.
YOU'RE PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUSCATHOLIC POLITICIAN, I'M THE
MOST FAMOUS CATHOLIC ONTELEVISION.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE HISPANICVOTE FOR A SECOND?
THEY'RE CATHOLICS, WHY CAN'TCONSERVATIVES REACH OUT TO THE
HISPANICS?
(APPLAUSE)FOR PETE'S SAKE, THE POPE IS AN
HISPANIC NOW.
DOESN'T THAT KIND OF MAKE USHISPANIC OURSELVES?
>> WHAT.
>> Stephen: BY THE TRANSITIVEPROPERTY OF ALL THINGS?
>> WELL, HE'S THE HOLY FATHER.
>> CAN WE REACH OUT TO THEM ONSOCIAL ISSUES?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAIDWITH THE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY
THEY WANT TO ABANDON THESEISSUES.
THE WAY WE CAN REACH OUT TO ALARGE SEGMENT OF THE MINORITY
POPULATION IS THROUGH SOCIALISSUES, IS THROUGH ISSUES WHERE
THERE IS COMMON AGREEMENT ONTHOSE BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT GAYMARRIAGE?
WE'RE LOSING THIS ONE, AREN'TWE?
WE'VE GOT 15 STATES PLUS THEDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHO ARE
RIDING THE --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M ANGRY, TOO.
WE'VE GOT 15 STATES PLUS THEDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RIDING THE
RAINBOW TRAIN TO HELL TUNE.
(LAUGHTER)HASN'T THIS ONE SLIPPED AWAY
FROM US?
>> I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM HEREIS MARRIAGE HAS SLIPPED AWAY
FROM US.
MARRIAGE HAS DEINVOLVED INTOJUST A PRO MAN TICK RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE AND THAT'SNOT WHAT MARRIAGE IS.
>> Stephen: IT'S FORTRANSFERRING PROPERTY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> YOU 1%ERS DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: I'VE READ THE OLDTESTAMENT.
>> MARRIAGE IS MORE THAN THATAND HETEROSEXUALS HAVE LOST THE
DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE SO IT'SNOT SURPRISING THAT OTHER PEOPLE
WANT TO SEE, WELL, THIS IS ALLMARRIAGE IS TODAY AND SO WE
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT.
AND SO I THINK THE BETTER DEBATEIS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT NARJ IS
AND RECLAIM THE INSTITUTION AS AMAN AND A WOMAN COMING TOGETHER
TO HAVE CHILDREN AND RAISE THEMA WAY THAT CONTINUES SOCIETY.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF WE CUT BAITON IT?
WHAT IF WE JUST SAY IT'S ANEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S GONE TO SEED
WE JUST LEAVE THE KEYS TOMARRIAGE OUT FRONT AND WE GO GET
SOMETHING BETTER?
(LAUGHTER)GAYS YOU CAN HAVE MARRIAGE
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MARRIAGEKIND OF SEEMS GAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)REAL GAY.
WE GO GET SOMETHING BETTER.
>> WELL, THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I'MMAKING.
THE ARGUMENT I'M MAKING IS WEHAVE TO CLAIM WHAT MARRIAGE IS.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT.
>> I JUST SAID BEFORE.
>> Stephen: I WASN'T LISTENING.
(LAUGHTER)>> IT'S THE UNION OF A MAN AND A
WOMAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF HAVINGAND RAISING CHILDREN AND
CONTINUING SOCIETY.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEENABOUT AND IT'S MORE THAN JUST --
IT IS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUTIT'S MORE THAN THAT.
>> Stephen: BUT WHAT IS IT NOT?
BECAUSE YOU FAMOUSLY ONCE SAID"IT'S NOT MAN ON CHILD, MAN ON
DOG, OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE."
(LAUGHTER)IS IT DOG ON DOG, BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE -- THAT'S THE QUOTE.
>> WELL, IT'S A LITTLE TAKEN OUTOF CONTEXT.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?
CONTEXTUALIZE ME.
>> CONTEXTUALIZING IT IS THATWHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A
RELATIONSHIP THAT IS IMPORTANTFOR THE CONTINUANCE OF SOCIETY
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUSON.
>> Stephen: I'VE HEARD SOMEDISTURBING NEWS THAT GAY PEOPLE
HAVE CHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'VE HEARD SOME PLACES THEY CANEVEN ADOPT CHILDREN.
>> YEAH.
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT.
EVERY CHILD HAS THE RIGHT TOTHEIR NATURAL MOTHER AND FATHER.
EVERY CHILD HAS A NATURAL MOTHERAND FATHER AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT
TO THOSE MOTHERS AND -- THATMOTHER AND FATHER TO GIVE THEM
WHAT ONLY A MOTHER AND ONLY AFATHER CAN GIVE.
>> WHAT IF THEY DON'T A MOTHEROR A FATHER?
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THEMTO HAVE NO PARENTS THAN TO BE
LOVED BY TWO GAY PEOPLE?
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: THE POINT OF THE LAW
IS TO ENCOURAGE WHAT IS BEST,RIGHT?
IT'S TO SET A STANDARD FOR WHATIS BEST, NOT TO SET A STANDARD
SHORT OF WHAT HAVE IS BESTBECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU'LL
GET LESS THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT'S THE NEXTMOVIE IN SOMETHING THAT CAN
APPEAL TO CONSERVATIVES LIKE ACHRISTMAS MOVIE WHERE RUDOLPH'S
NOSE IS BRIGHT ENOUGH THATPEOPLE CAN EXERCISE THEIR SECOND
AMENDMENT RIGHTS EASIER?
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)>> NOT THERE YET.
>> Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH ECHOLIGHT STUDIOS.
SENATOR RICK SANTORUM.
