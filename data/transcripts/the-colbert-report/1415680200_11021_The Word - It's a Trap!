I FOR ONE AM STILL RIDING HIGHFROM THE G.O.P.'S TRIUMPH IN
LAST WEEK'S MIDTERM ELECTION.
THIS MEANS THERE WILL BE MOREREPUBLICANS THAN EVER MAKING
GOVERNMENT SMALLER BY WORKINGFULL-TIME IN WASHINGTON.
(LAUGHTER)IN FACT, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO
DESCRIBE THIS VICTORY.
>> WE'VE GOT A NEW CONGRESS,WE'VE GOT A NEW MANDATE.
>> THE MANDATE WAS SKEPTICISM BYAMERICAN PEOPLE THE COUNTRY IS
NOT HEADED IN THE RIGHTDIRECTION.
>> IT WAS ABSOLUTELY A MANDATE.
>> Stephen: YES, IT WASABSOLUTELY A MANDATE, THANKS TO
AN HISTORIC TURNOUT OF JUST 37%OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS, THE LOWEST
SINCE 1942.
AND REMEMBER, THAT WAS THEGREATEST GENERATION!
BACK THEN, ON ELECTION DAY, THEYOUNG PEOPLE WERE TOO BUSY
ANSWERING THE CALL OF DUTY TOVOTE.
JUST LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY.
(LAUGHTER)AND NOW THAT THE G.O.P. HAS
THEIR LARGEST MAJORITY IN 85YEARS, THANKS TO THE LOWEST
VOTER TURNOUT IN 72 YEARS, THEYHAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ENACT
THE AGENDA OF THE ANGRIEST MANIN THE SMALLEST COUNTY IN IOWA.
THEY JUST NEED TO DO ONETHING --
>> NOW THE REPUBLICANS NEED TOGOVERN.
>> PUT FORWARD THEIR PLANS,THEIR IDEAS, THEIR SOLUTIONS FOR
THE COUNTRY.
>> THEY NEED TO STEP FORWARDWITH A PLAN.
>> SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THATTHEY CAN GOVERN.
>> REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO TAKETHIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY THEY
HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND ACTUALLYGOVERN SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: YES, IT IS TIMEFOR REPUBLICANS TO GOVERN.
BEFORE THIS, THEY WERE JUST PAIDEXTRAS ON C-SPAN.
(LAUGHTER)AND THAT CALL FOR G.O.P.
LEADERSHIP BRINGS US TOTONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, SENATOR AKBAR.
IT IS A TRAP.
IT MAY SEEM LIKE THE AMERICANPEOPLE WANT REPUBLICANS TO GET
SOMETHING DONE, BUT DON'T YOUFALL FOR IT!
THAT'S NOT JUST AKBAR TALKING.
THAT'S ALSO ADVICE FROM JABBATHE RUSH.
>> IT IS THE BIGGEST AND PERHAPSTHE MOST IMPORTANT MANDATE A
POLITICAL PARTY HAS HAD IN THERECENT ERA, IT IS VERY SIMPLE
WHAT THE MANDATE IS.
IT IS TO STOP BARACK OBAMA.
REPUBLICANS WERE NOT ELECTED TOGOVERN.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
REPUBLICANS WERE NOT ELECTED TOGOVERN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HUGE, HUGE RUSH LIMBAUGH FANS
HERE TONIGHT!
(CHEERING)REPUBLICANS WEREN'T ELECTED TO
GOVERN.
THEIR ONE JOB IS TO STOP OBAMA!
BUT THERE'S AN EVEN MORE URGENTREASON TO DO NOTHING.
(LAUGHTER)ACCORDING TO A NEW EDITORIAL BY
THE NATIONAL REVIEW CALLED "THEGOVERNING TRAP," IF VOTERS CAME
TO BELIEVE THAT A REPUBLICANCONGRESS AND A DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT ARE DOING A FINE JOBOF GOVERNING TOGETHER, WHY
WOULDN'T THEY VOTE TO CONTINUETHE ARRANGEMENT IN 2016?
YES, THEN YOU WILL BE TRAPPEDTOGETHER FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS
DOING A COMPETENT JOB OFGOVERNING!
WHO WANTS THAT?
POINT IS, ANYTHING REPUBLICANSACCOMPLISH, NO MATTER HOW
INSIGNIFICANT, COULD LEAD TOPRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON.
(CHEERING)BESIDES, NOBODY LIKES PEOPLE WHO
ACTUALLY GOVERN.
LOOK AT OBAMA.
HE TURNED THE ECONOMY AROUND ANDGAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
HEALTHCARE -- WHAT AN ASSHOLE.
AND AS THE NATIONAL REVIEWPOINTS OUT, NOT ONLY WOULD
GOVERNING BE TOO EFFECTIVE, ITWOULD ALSO BE COMPLETELY
INEFFECTIVE.
BECAUSE "IF REPUBLICANS PROCLAIMTHAT THEY HAVE TO GOVERN NOW
THAT THEY RUN CONGRESS, THEYMAXIMIZE THE INCENTIVE FOR THE
DEMOCRATS TO FILIBUSTEREVERYTHING THEY CAN."
YES, AND FILIBUSTERINGEVERYTHING YOU CAN IS COWARDLY.
WHAT IS WORSE: "APROVE-YOU-CAN-GOVERN STRATEGY
WILL INEVITABLY DIVIDE THE PARTYON THE SAME TEA PARTY VS.
ESTABLISHMENT LINES THATREPUBLICANS HAVE JUST SUCCEEDED
IN OVERCOMING."
THAT'S RIGHT.
IF REPUBLICANS DO ANYTHING, ITWILL START THE INFIGHTING.
THINK ABOUT IT -- THE BEATLESNEVER WOULD HAVE BROKEN UP IF
THEY NEVER RELEASED ANY RECORDS.
INSTEAD OF MAKING THE MISTAKE OFDOING THINGS NOW, THE NATIONAL
REVIEW SAYS THE G.O.P. SHOULDFOCUS ON THE FUTURE BY"BUILDING
THE CASE FOR REPUBLICANGOVERNANCE AFTER 2016" AND
"EXPLAINING WHAT REPUBLICANS...
WOULD DO IF THEY HAD THE WHITEHOUSE ."
YES, IT'S TIME TO SHOW THEAMERICAN PEOPLE THAT
REPUBLICANS ARE CAPABLE OF BOLD,DECISIVE ACTION...
SOMETIME LATER.
(LAUGHTER)THEN REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO
TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND WHEN THEY FINALLY CONTROLTHE PRESIDENCY AND BOTH HOUSES
OF CONGRESS, AT LAST IT WILL BETIME TO GOVERN...
IS JUST WHAT THEY WANT YOU TOTHINK.
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST ANOTHERTRAP!
BECAUSE THE G.O.P. CAN'T ACTUNTIL THEY'VE SECURED AN
ALL-REPUBLICAN SUPREME COURT, 50REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, 50
REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATORS,AND AN ALL-REPUBLICAN PROM
COMMITTEE.
(LAUGHTER)AND EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO
DEMOCRATS LEFT ANYWHERE, THEYSTILL SHOULD NOT GOVERN.
BECAUSE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN COULDRUN AGAINST THEM IN THE PRIMARY.
AND THEY'D BE WIDE OPEN TOATTACKS ON THEIR VOTING RECORD
IF THEY HAVE ONE.(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, REFUSING TO GOVERN ATALL
MIGHT EVENTUALLY BECOME HARD TOSELL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SO
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT UNTILTHERE ISN'T AN AMERICA ANYMORE.
AND IF THEY REFUSE THERESPONSIBILITY TO GOVERN, WELL,
THAT WILL BE RIGHT AROUND THECORNER.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
