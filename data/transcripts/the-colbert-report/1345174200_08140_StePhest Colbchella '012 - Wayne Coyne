(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WAYNE, HI,
HELLO.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> HELLO, STEPHEN COLBERT,
WE'RE IN A SPACE CAPSULE,
AREN'T WE.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
YOU CAN IMAGINE BEING STRAPPED INTO ONE OF THESE THINGS AND FIRED ON THE TOP
OF A GIANT BOTTLE OF LIQUID HYDROGEN, LIQUID OXYGEN AND BE SENT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE THAT.
>> YEAH, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
TAKE A LOT OF DRUGS AND MAYBE BE PASSED OUT FOR THE TAKEOFF AND WAKE UP WHEN ARE YOU UP THERE.
>> Stephen: A LOT OF YOUR MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE THE IDEAS COME FROM OUTER SPACE.
>> I KNOW.
I CAN SEE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU LOOK GOOD ON YOUR BACK.
>> DO I.
>> Stephen: YES.
YOU DO TOO.
>> Stephen: I'M GUESSING THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE HEARD THAT.
>> IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD IT FROM YOU.
>> Stephen: WAYNE, BEING IN THIS CAPSULE WITH YOU, LYING NEXT TO YOU LIKE THIS, DOES
THIS MAKE ME A GROUPIE.
IS THAT WHAT GROUPIE MEANS IS YOU ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN SMALL SPACES.
>> IT'S JUST A TERM FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU BECAUSE THEY LIKE
YOUR MUSIC.
>> Stephen: DOES THAT HAPPEN?
>> YEAH, ALL THE TIME.
>> Stephen: IS THAT GOOD, IS THAT AVOID-- ANNOYING HAVING PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH
YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR MUSIC.
>> WELL-- .
>> Stephen: AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER REASONS TO MAKE MUSIC THAN THAT.
BECAUSE I IMAGINE A LOT OF GUYS GET INTO MUSIC FOR THAT REASON.
>> WELL, I DIDN'T, YOU KNOW,
I LIKE MUSIC IN AND OF ITSELF AND I LIKE SEX IN AND OF ITSELF.
SO I DIDN'T-- .
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE AM YOU HAVE TO GIVE ONE UP, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP
SEX OR MUSIC, GO.
>> MUSIC.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH YOU HAVE A SIX HOUR SONG.
>> WE DO.
>> Stephen: WHO IS THAT FOR.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: OTHER THAN ME BECAUSE I USE IT TO MAKE LOVE, OBVIOUSLY I HAVE TO
PUT THAT ON REPEAT.
>> I-- WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION.

NOW YOU WORKED IN A LONG JOHN SILVERS, DID YOU NOT.
>> YEAH, I WORKED THERE.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG.
>> WELL, I MEAN I STARTED WORKING THERE WHEN I WAS 16,
IN 1977.
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE THE GOLDEN YEARS FOR LONG JOHN SILVER.
>> FUNNY YOU SAY IT.
THEY REALLY WERE.
PEOPLE REALLY LIKE TO EAT FRIED FISH A LOT MORE BACK THEN THAN THEY DO NOW.
THE EVILS OF FRIED FOOD HAS RUINED IT, I SUPPOSE.
BUT I DID.
AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
I HAVE TO SAY-- .
>> Stephen: YOU LOVED WORKING AT LONG JOHN SILVER.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO THERE.
>> I WAS JUST A COOK, A FRY COOK.
>> Stephen: SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE SORT OF THE PERSONALITY REQUIRED TO WORK THE COUNTER.
>> WELL, NO, I WOULD.
THERE WOULD BE DAYS.
IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG TO REALLY BECOME A MASTER OF ALL THE SKILLS AT THE RESTAURANT.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY YEARS ARE WE TALKING.
>> WELL, I THINK FROM 1977 TO ABOUT 1990 SO A LONG TIME.
>> Stephen: 13 YEARS.
>> A LONG TIME.
>> Stephen: AT ANY POINT DID,
WHILE YOU WERE, SAY LIKE 11 YEARS IN DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT JUST THROWING YOURSELF
HEAD FIRST INTO THE FRIER.
>> NO, NO, I MEAN I ALWAYS,
EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING, I MEAN, I WAS LUCKY, I MEAN IT'S NOT A VERY HARD JOB SO
YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING-- .
>> Stephen: OH, I DON'T KNOW.
>> FOR ME IT WAS FUN AND EASY BUT-- .
>> Stephen: DID YOU EVER HAVE A REALLY GREAT DAY AT THE FRIER AND SAY YEAH, I
[BLEEP] ROCKED THAT SIX PIECE.
>> YEAH, I WORKED THERE FOR SO LONG AND I WOULD WORK DOUBLE SHIFTS EVEN WHEN I
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WOULD WORK ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT THAT IS A LONG TIME.
>> Stephen: RUMOR IS THAT WHEN YOU STARTED OUT FOR YOUR FIRST EQUIPMENT YOU
STOLE IT FROM A CHURCH S THAT TRUE.
>> WE DIDN'T STEAL IT OURSELVES.
>> Stephen: DID SOMEBODY STEEL IT.
>> I BELIEVE IT HAD ALREADY BEEN STOLEN.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU THINK GOD WILL FEEL ABOUT THAT ANSWER WHEN ARE YOU AT THE
PEARLY GATES.
>> I THINK HE HAS ALREADY FORGIVEN ME.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> HE TOLD ME.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU A RELIGIOUS GUY, SPIRITUAL.
>> NO, NO.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU GIVE A DAMN.
COME AND GET ME, COME AND GET ME GOD.
I AM WAYNE COYNE.
>> WELL, I DIDN'T-- .
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO APOLOGISE TO GOD.
>> NO I STILL FELT LIKE WE DID THE RIGHT THING AT THE TIME.
>> Stephen: INJURE LATEST MUSICAL EFFORT RIGHT NOW IS CALLED FLAMING FLIPS AND HEADY FWENZE.
ARE THESE REALLY YOUR FRENZ OR ARE THEY MORE LIKE PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUES.
>> KNOCK, I THINK TERBA HAS REALLY BECOME ONE OF MY GREAT DEAR, DEAR FRIENDS.
>> Stephen: YOU WORKED WITH YOKO ONO ON THIS ALBUM.
>> NOT SPECIFICALLY IN THE ROOM WITH HER.
A LOT OF THESE THINGS WE WOULD WORK REMOTELY DOING E-MAILS.
YOKO WAS IN LONDON.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU LUCKY TO WORK WITH HER.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: NOT SO LUCKY TO STILL BE TOGETHER WITH A BAND BECAUSE SHE WILL BREAK
UP A BAND LIKE THAT.
>> NO, NO, SEE-- .
>> Stephen: SHE WILL BREAK UP ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE.
SHE WORKED AT THE DAILY SHOW RECENTLY THAT IS WHY COREL AND I LEFT.
ARE YOU EVER AFRAID THAT SUCCESS WILL GO TO YOUR HEAD.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
I MEAN I HOPE IT DOES AND GIVES ME CONFIDENCE AND MAKES PEOPLE LIKE MY MUSIC
EVEN IF IT IS NOT WORTH LIKING.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU SHAKE IT UP AFTER 30 YEARS?
>> WELL, I THINK I'M LUCKY,
I THINK WE GET BORED ESPECIALLY WITH OUR OWN CREATIONS AND OUR OWN MUSIC.
WE GET BORED WITH THAT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET BORED WITH A SIX HOUR SONG.
IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.
>> THAT WOULD BE THE DILEMMA T WOULD BE BORG.
I THINK IS THAT WE ARE LUCKY THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS AND WE ARE INTERESTED AND WE
LISTEN AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.
I THINK WE'RE JUST REALLY LUCKY.
I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS.
>> Stephen: WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU HERE TONIGHT.
ARE YOU READY TO ROCK THE INTREPID.
>> WE'RE COMPLETELY READY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
