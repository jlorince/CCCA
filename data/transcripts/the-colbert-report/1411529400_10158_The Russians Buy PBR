(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: HEY!
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, AS AN AMERICAN, I ENJOY
TO EAT FOOD.
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS HOLE.
BUT SOMETIMES IT GETS CLOGGED UPWITH ALL THE FOOD.
EVEN IF I'VE CHEWED IT FIRST.
SO TO WASH IT DOWN, I ALWAYSREACH FOR THE QUINTESSENTIAL
AMERICAN BEER, PABST BLUERIBBON.
(APPLAUSE)SO NAMED BECAUSE IT WAS JUDGED
AMERICA'S BEST AS RECENTLY ASTHE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR OF
1893.
(LAUGHTER)WHERE I BELIEVE IT BEAT OUT
JEBEDIAH VAN KRAUTMAN'S WORMWOODCHOLERA TONIC.
AND PABST ALWAYS HAD THE BESTCOMMERCIALS.
>> HEINEKEN!
PABST BLUE RIBBON!
>> STEPHEN: THEY JUST DON'TWRITE JINGLES LIKE THAT ANYMORE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, PABST "IS" AMERICA.
THAT'S WHY, WHEN I HEARD THIS, IEXPLODED LIKE A CAN OF P.B.R. IN
THE GLOVEBOX.
>> A BOMBSHELL IN THE BEERCOMMUNITY TODAY.
P.B.R. IS GOING TO THE FORMERU.S.S.R.
P.B.R. WAS ALWAYS A GOODROCK-RIBBED AMERICAN BLUE-COLLAR
BRAND THAT ENJOYED A SECONDWIND, THANKS TO THE EMBRACE OF
HIPSTERS.
PABST AND SISTER BRANDS COLT 45AND OLD MILWAUKEE ARE ALL BEING
SOLD TO A LARGE RUSSIAN BREWINGCOMPANY CALLED OASIS BEVERAGES.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE DAMN RUSSKIES ARE BUYINGP.B.R.!
(AUDIENCE BOOING)HOW WOULD "THEY" LIKE IT IF WE
BOUGHT THEIR KRAFT RUSSIANDRESSING?
(LAUGHTER)AND I DON'T BUY OASIS BEVERAGE'S
CLAIM THAT "THERE ARE DEFINITELYNO PLANS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE
RECIPES."
DO YOU REALLY EXPECT US TOBELIEVE PABST HAS A RECIPE?
(LAUGHTER)EVERYONE KNOWS THEY JUST CATCH
WHAT THEY CAN SQUEEGEE FROM THESIDE OF A BUDWEISER CLYDESDALE.
(LAUGHTER)WORSE, THE RUSSIANS AREN'T
GETTING ONLY PABST.
THE SALE INCLUDES OLD MILWAUKEE,SCHLITZ AND COLT 45.
THAT'S RIGHT.
"ALL" THE BEER LEFT IN YOURFRIDGE AFTER A PARTY IN 1975.
(APPLAUSE)OF COURSE, IT'S P.B.R., THAT
REALLY HURTS.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THECLASSIC AMERICAN BEER ENJOYED BY
YOUR GRANDFATHER.
THANKS TO THE HIPSTER REVIVAL,IT'S THE CLASSIC AMERICAN BEER
ENJOYED BY YOUNG PEOPLE TRYINGTO LOOK LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER.
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE NOT JUSTTAKING AN AMERICAN ICON, THEY'RE
TAKING AMERICAN IRONY.
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT SURPRISED.
THEY'VE BEEN GROWING RIDICULOUSHIPSTER BEARDS SINCE RASPUTIN.
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT GUY
DOESN'T MAKE HIS OWN PICKLES?
COME ON!
ALL RIGHT.
TO THE BARRICADES!
DEFEND OUR P.B.R.!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW, MAYBE I OVERREACTED.
