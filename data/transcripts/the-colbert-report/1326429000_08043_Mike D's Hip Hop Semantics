>> Stephen: OH, HEY.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHENEVER A FRIEND OF THIS
SHOW IS UNDER ATTACK I LEAP
TO THEIR DEFENSE.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO UP SET
ABOUT A RECENT ATTACK ON
"NEW YORK TIMES" PUZZLE
EDITOR WILL SHORTZ OR AS WE
CALL HIM IN OUR ANAGRAM
CLUB-- NOW WIZ HERE HAS BEEN
CATCHING HEAT FOR A CLUE IN
LAST SATURDAY'S CROSSWORD,
BACK IN HIP-HOP.
THE-- WACH IN HIP-HOP THE
ANSWER WAS ILLIN WHICH I
KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHEN I READ
THE ANSWERS ON MONDAY.
BUT WEB BLOGGER JULYIE ANN
SMOLINSKI GOT UP UP IN HIS
GRILL SAYING THE CLUE READS
WACK IN HIP-HOP AND THE
ANSWER IS ILLIN, THESE ARE
NOT THE SAME THINGS AT ALL.
AH, 4 LETTER WORD IS A SOUND
PRODUCED BY FINGAHS.
BUT IF YOU STEP TO WILL
SHORTZ HE WILL BEAT YOU DOWN
AND ACROSS.
THIS IS WHY DEAR JULYIE ANN
ACCORD TOGETHER DICTION' OF
AMERICAN SLANG EDITED BY RON
ERT CHAPIN ILLIN MEANS
STUPID INSANE, WACK DEFINED
AS WORTHLESS, STUPID.
THE DICTIONARY DEFINES ILLIN
AS BAD, UNCOOL SO IT SEEMS
TO ME THE CLUE IS FINE.
DAMN, GIRL, YOU JUST GOT
SHORTZED.
HE PULLED OUT TONY THORNE,
FACULTY LEXICOGRAPHER AT
KING'S COLLEGE IN LONDON, PH
TO THE D.
WELL, ONCE AGAIN I GOT TO
SETTLE IT.
AFTER ALL, I HAVE BEEN A
"NEW YORK TIMES" CROSSWORD
ANSWER AND I AM A HIP-HOP
LEGEND EVER SINCE YASSIN BEY
BEQUEATHED TO ME THE NAME
MOS DEF WHICH I BELIEVE
STANDS FOR MOST DEFINITIONS.
AND HERE TO HELP ME
DECONSTRUCT THE MEANING OF
ILLIN IS THE ONLY AUTHORITY
WITH A LICENCE TO ILL,
PLEASE WELCOME HEAD GRAMMARRIAN
OF THE BEASTIE BOYZ, MIKE D.
THANK YOU SOPH MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
SIT DOWN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME, WELCOME.
DR. D, WHAT AN HONOR.
MI SURE YOU'VE HEARD ALL
ABOUT THIS TRAGIC DRIVE-BY
SHORTZING.
>> WELL, IT'S ALL THE TALK
OF THE HIP-HOP COMMUNITY,
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: SO MIKE, WHATCHA
WHATCHA WHATCHA THINK.
>> WELL, MR. SHORTZ AND MISS
SMOLINSKI MAKE SALIENT
POINTS WHEN EASYY E STATES
IN BOYS IN THE HOOD HOW HE
IS BORED AS HELL AND WANTS
TO GET ILL, WE CAN INFER
THAT GETTING ILL IS THE
OPPOSITE OF BOREDOM, A FORM
OF DIVERSION, IF YOU WILL.
>> Stephen: TRUE.
BECAUSE WANTING TO GET ILL
WHERE DOES HE GO, TO THE
SPOT WHERE HIS HOME BOYS
CHILL.
>> EXACTLY.
POINT, MISS SMOLINSKI.
HOWEVER IF IF I MAY POINT
TON EARLIER WORK, THE FIRST
MODERN USAGE OF ILLIN
APPEARS IN RUNNY AND C'S
RECORDING YOU BE ILLIN IN
WHICH THEY CLEVERLY OBSERVED
YOU PRECEDED TO EAT IT KUZ
YOU WAS IN THE MOOD BUT
HOMES, DID YOU NOT READ T IT
WAS A CAN OF DOG FOOD YOU BE
ILLIN.
>> Stephen: WELL, I THINK WE
CAN ALL AGREE THAT EATING
DOG FOOD FOR DIN CERTIFICATE
MOST CERTAINLY WACK.
>> PRECISELY.
POINT, MR. SHORTZ.
>> Stephen: SO IF I'M
HEARING YOU CORRECTLY, RIGHT
NOW IT IS A TIE.
>> NOT SO FAST, DR. COLBERT.
I REFER YOU TO 1986'S
ANTHEMIC TIME TO GET ILL.
IN THIS CASE, BEING A
FRAGMENT OF MENTALLY ILL.
AND THEREFORE AN EXERTATION
TO ABANDON'S ONE INHIBITIONS
AS OPPOSED TO ACTING BADLY.
>> Stephen: WELL, IT WOULD
BE CLEAR THEN, MY FRIEND
THAT WILL SHORTZ HAS BEEN
MIKE DENIED.
>> FAIRLY JULYIE ANN
SMOLINSKI IS THE VICKAR AND
IF I MAY, MR. SHORTZ, YOU BE
ILLIN.

GENTLEMEN, BEASTIE MAN MIKE
D.
