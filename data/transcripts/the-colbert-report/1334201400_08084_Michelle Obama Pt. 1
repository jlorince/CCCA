( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A GRADUATE OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND HARVARD LAW WHO CURRENTLY WORKS
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
PLEASE WELCOME FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MADAM, FIRST LADY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I APOLOGIZE.
THEY NORMALLY DON'T CHEER FOR ME THAT LONG.
( LAUGHTER ).
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK ON THE SHOW.
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen:  YOU WERE HERE ALMOST EXACTLY FOUR YEARS AGO.
>> YEAH, BUT WE WEREN'T HERE.
>> Stephen:  NO, NO, NO.
WE WERE IN PHILADELPHIA.
IT WAS DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE ON MY SHOW, YOU WERE NOT THE FIRST LADY.
NOW YOU ARE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
NOW, LET'S BUMP JOINING FORCES.
TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND HOW THEY CAN GET INVOLVED.
>> JILL BIDEN AND I STARTED THIS INITIATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS A
GRATEFUL NATION, THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HONOR THE SERVICE OF OUR
TROOPS, OUR VETERANS, AND THEIR FAMILIES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THIS IS THE ONE-YEAR
ANNIVERSARY, AND WE'VE HAD --
>> Stephen:  YOU LAUNCHED IT ONE YEAR AGO TODAY.
>> ONE YEAR AGO TODAY, SO WE'RE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY, SO
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US ON, ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.
BUT PEOPLE HAVE REALLY BEEN STEPPING UP IN SOME AMAZING WAYS.
I MEAN, WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE HIRING OUR VETERANS AND FINDING WONDERFUL FLEXIBLE OPPORTUNITIES
FOR SPOUSES, BECAUSE EMPLOYMENT IS A KEY ISSUE FOR THESE FAMILIES.
>> Stephen:  UNEMPLOYMENT FOR RETURNING VETS WAS WAY ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
>> IT WAS.
>> Stephen:  WHERE IS IT NOW?
>> WE'RE SEEING IT DECREASE AT SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RATES.
SO-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT UNTIL WE GET TO ZERO, WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
WE WANT IT SEE THAT NUMBER AT ZERO BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT BENEFITTING THESE MEN AND WOMEN.
I MEAN, THESE PEOPLE ARE BRINGING IN SKILLS THAT ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE BOTTOM LINE OF COMPANIES.
BECAUSE THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED, HIGHLY SKILLED, DISCIPLINED PEOPLE THAT
WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY, THE BEST THIS COUNTRY HAS TO OFFER.
SO WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  TEAM PLAYERS,
CLEARLY TEAM PLAYERS.
I HAVE ONLY ONE CRITICISM, IS THAT IT'S JOININGFORCEs.GOV,
RIGHT?
>> IT IS.GOFF.
>> Stephen:  IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT.
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN HELP THE TROOPS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
OUR MOTTO IS EVERYONE CAN COSOMETHING.
IT ISN'T BIG GOVERNMENT.
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE IT PLAY BUT IT CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.
EVERYONE HAS TO STEP UP IN WAYS BIG AND SMALL YOU.
>> Stephen:  KNOW WHAT I THINK WOULD BE A GREAT REASON TO HIRE
SOMEONE WHO WAS IN THE MILITARY AT YOUR PRIVATE BUSINESS IS THAT HE-- WITH THE STORIES HE TELLS
OF HIS PREVIOUS JOB, HE'LL REALLY MAKE THE INTEROFFICE COMPLAINING SOUND TRIVIAL.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen:  RAISE MORAL IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.
>> IT'S HARD TO BE A WHINER AROUND A VETERAN.
>> Stephen:  IT REALLY IS.
>> IT MAKES IT TOUGH.
>> Stephen:  AS SOMEONE WHO HAS APPEARED ON BOTH MY SHOW AND HAS ALSO APPEARED ON I CARLY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  WHICH OF US DO YOU THINK HAS MORE GRAVITAS AS A BROADCASTER?
>> WELL, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
>> I CARLY IS ABOUT 16, AND SHE'S REAL DEEP.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  RIGHT, SHE IS VERY DEEP.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  I SHOULD ADD-- I SHOULD ADD SOME RANDOM DANCING TO MY SHOW.
>> WE CAN TRY IT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAYBE LATER.
>> Stephen:  MAYBE LATER.
>> I'LL BE ABLE TO JUDGE BETTER WHEN THIS IS OVER.
I'LL LET YOU BE.
>> Stephen:  WE HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL.
CAN YOU HANG OUT AND TALK SOME MORE AFTER THE BREAK?
>> ABSOLUTELY, I WOULD LOVE TO.
>> Stephen:  GOOD, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T I HAVE NO
