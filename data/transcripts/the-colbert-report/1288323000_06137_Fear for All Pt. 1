BE AFRAID OF MEXICANS.

YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVERT ME
RIGHT NOW AND THEN ONCE I'M GAY
YOU'LL TRY TO GAY MARRY ME.
IT'S PART OF THE AGENDA BUT IT
WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE I HAVE THE

>> Stephen: I CALL THEM
SURPRISE GAYS.

DOOGIE.

WHILE.
THAT WAS SHOCK FOR A LOT OF US
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY
COMFORTABLE TO HAVE A
16-YEAR-OLD DOCTOR CHECKING FOR
A HERNIA AND NOW WE KNOW THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
GAY PERSON.
DO BEARS DEMONSTRATE HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR?

WORRIES.

NOT --
>> WE CAN'T BRAND AN ENFIRE
COMMUNITY THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF
A FEW.
>> Stephen: I THINK WE HAVE.
THE ACTIONS HAVE PROVEN YOU
WRONG.

LOGIC TO THAT STATEMENT.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'S LOGIC.
IT'S BETTER THAN NO LOGIC.
