OLD-FASHIONED.
NOW FOLKS, JUSTICE MAY BE BLIND BUT I'M NOT.
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S WEARING SPANX UNDER THAT ROBE.
THIS IS JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER.
TONIGHT, FOLKS, COPYRIGHT LAW.
THE SUPREME COURT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING THE CASE OF SUPAP KIRTSAENG THE WILE YA SONG, IT A TEXTBOOK
COPYRIGHT CASE IN THAT IT IS A COPYRIGHT CASE ABOUT TEXTBOOKS.
JIM.
>> MR. KIRTSAENG IN 1997 MOVED FROM HIS NATIVE THAILAND TO ATTEND CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
TEXTBOOKS ARE SOLD IN THAILAND FOR JUST A FRACTION OF THE COST.
SO HE GETS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO BUY THOSE TEXTBOOKS IN THAILAND AND GUESS WHAT, SHIP THEM TO HIM
IN CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
HE SELLS THEM ON eBAY AND MAKES, GET THIS, $1.2 MILLION IN PROFITS.
>> WHAT?
>> Stephen: 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS, IT THAT TEXTBOOK PRICE, THAT HAS TO BE LIKE
EIGHT BOOKS.
BUT ACADEMIC PUBLISHER WILEY AND SON SUED SIT  KAENING-- KIRTSAENG SAYING THEY OWN THE COPYRIGHT OF
THAT RESOLD MATERIAL DESPITE A 1908 COURT DECISION WHICH ESTABLISHED THE FIRST SALE
DOCTRINE WHICH SAYS THAT AFTER A BUYER FIRST PURCHASES A COPYRIGHTED WORK HE OR SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO
RESELL IT.
I'M SORRY, I DON'T BUY THIS FIRST SALE ARGUMENT.
AND IF I DID BUY IT I WOULD NOT RESELL IT.
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT.
YEAH.
DAMN STRAIGHT.
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT NEVER'S CLAPPING FOR.
(LAUGHTER) BUT GOD HELP US, IF THE U.S.
SUPREME COURT DOES OVERTURN THE RIGHT OF FIRST SALE.
>> YOU ARE HEARING A CASE THAT IF THEY RULE ONE WAY WOULD SAY TO US, WE THE
PEOPLE, HEY, YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR OWN STUFF.
>> IT WOULD ALMOST MAKE eBAY ILLEGAL.
>> Stephen: eBAY ILLEGAL?
THAT COULD DESTABILIZE THE GLOBAL MARKET IN WELCOME BACK KOTTER BOARD GAMES.
BUT DON'T WORRY.
EVEN IF THE SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH WILEY AND SONS T WOULDN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T SELL ANYTHING.
THE COURT HAS RULED THAT THE RIGHT OF FIRST SALE APPLIES TO ANY PRODUCT MANUFACTURED
IN THE UNITED STATES.
SO YOU ARE FREE TO RESELL ANYTHING STILL MADE IN AMERICA LIKE YOUR TRUCK OR YOUR METH.
AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO RESELL ANYTHING MADE OVERSEAS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE PERMISSION OF THE
ORIGINAL COPYRIGHT HOLDER.
FOR INSTANCE, I AM HAVING A GARAGE SALE THIS WEEKEND.
SOME OF THE STUFF WAS MADE OVERSEAS, SO I AM SIMPLY CALLING ALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO WORK OUT A PROFIT
SHARING ARRANGEMENT.
HERE WE GO.
OKAY.
>> -- .
>> Stephen: ELVIS COSTELLO, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> STEPHEN, HOW ARE YOU?
>> Stephen: WELL, I'M OKAY, ELVIS.
BUT I'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
>> OH, GRACIOUS, HOW I CAN HELP?
>> Stephen: WELL, ELVIS, I'M HAVING A GARAGE SALE TOMORROW.
>> A GARAGE-- OH, A GARAGE SALE, OH, DOW NEED ANY HELP SETTING UP TABLES.
CAN I BE THE CASHIER, I DO LOVE COUNTING MONEY.
>> Stephen: NO, I'M SORRY, ELVIS, STING IS GOING TO BE THE CASHIER.
NO, I'M JUST CALLING BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO RESELL MY OLD COPY OF MY AIM IS TRUE.
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE FRIENDS BUT I HAVE GOT TO GET MY BACK WET ON THIS.
WHAT KIND OF MONEY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN THE DOLLAR BIN.
>> I'M HONORED.

>> SOLD!

>> HAVE FUN WITH STING.
>> Stephen: WELL-- HELLO?
