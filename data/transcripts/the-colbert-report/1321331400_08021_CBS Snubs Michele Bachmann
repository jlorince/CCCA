THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO OUR CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF NO SHAVE
NOVEMBER.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW AFTER
THAT WARM GREETING, NOT ONLY
ARE YOU WELCOME HERE, YOU
ARE FIRST HERE.
NATION--
(APPLAUSE)
IT'S NO SURPRISE I AM ADDICTED
TO ALL THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
THEY ARE LIKE CRACK, IN THAT
THEY WILL DEVASTATE BLACK
COMMUNITIES.
AND FOLKS, I GOT MY FIX ON
SATURDAY WITH YET ANOTHER
DEBATE.
THIS TIME SPONSORED BY CBS.
THE BIG NEWS WAS THAT A
WOMAN WAS MISTREATED AND
HERMAN CAIN HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH IT.
YOU SEE, MINNESOTA
CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE
BACHMANN'S CAMPAIGN IS
CRYING FOUL BECAUSE BACHMANN
WAS SLATED TO APPEAR ON A
POST DEBATE SHOW FOR CBS.
CBS'S NEW POLITICAL DIRECTOR
JOHN DICKERSON WAS INFORMED
OF THIS IN AN E-MAIL FROM
HIS PRODUCER, AND RESPONDED
BY WRITING, LET'S KEEP IT
LOOSE, IN THE HOPES WE CAN
GET SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE
BACHMANN WAS NOT GOING TO
GET MANY QUESTIONS IN THE
DEBATE SINCE HER LOW POLL
NUMBERS WEREN'T NEARLY OFF
THE CHARTS.
MS. BACHMANN'S
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR WAS
COPIED ON THE E-MAIL BECAUSE
MR. DICKERSON HIT "REPLY ALL"
NOW WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
LAUGH LAUGH ONE SLIP OF THE
MOUSE AND THE WRONG PERSON
GETS THAT PHOTO OF YOU IN
THE CROCLESS IRONMAN COSTUME.
AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES TO DOOR
RIS CONCERNS GOODWIN AND MY
APOLOGIES TO NO SHAVE
NOVEMBER.
(LAUGHTER)
NO SURPRISE--
(APPLAUSE)
NO SURPRISE AFTER
DICKERSON'S ACCIDENTAL
GABFEST BACHMANN'S CAMPAIGN
MANAGER STORMED THROUGH THE
SPIN ROOM SAYING JOHN
DICKERSON SHOULD BE FIRED.
HE IS A PIECE OF [BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)
TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, A
PIECE OF [BLEEP] IS POLLING
HIGHER THAN MICHELE
BACHMANN.
WELL--
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SHE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT THIS SNUB IS
REALLY ABOUT.
>> CLEARLY THIS WAS AN
EXAMPLE OF MEDIA BIAS.
>> Stephen: YES, MEDIA BIAS.
AND NOT JUST AGAINST MICHELE
BACHMANN, EVERY DAY THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA DENIES AIR
TIME TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WHO WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
AS BACHMANN'S CAMPAIGN
MANAGER KEITH NAHEGIAN
E-MAILED
REPORTER-- SUPPORTERS, THE
MEDIA ELITE ARE PURPOSELY
SUPPRESSING OUR CONSERVATIVE
MESSAGE.
YES, CBS IS CLEARLY BIASED
FOR ASKING MORE QUESTIONS OF
THE LEFT WING CANDIDATES
LIKE HERMAN CAIN, RICK PERRY,
MITT ROMNEY AND NEWT
GINGRICH.
THREE OF THESE COMRADES
DON'T EVEN WANT TO
ELECTROCUTE MEXICANS.
NOW THANKFULLY, BACHMANN HAS
TURNED THIS OUTRAGE INTO AN
OUTRAGE-PORTUNITY.
ON SUNDAY HER CAMPAIGN FIRED
OFF AN E-MAIL TO SUPPORTERS
SAYING PLEASE SHOW YOUR
SUPPORT BY TWEETING YOUR
OUTRAGE TO CBS NEWS.
AFTERWARDS I HOPE WILL YOU
MAKE A DONATION TO MICHELE'S
CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE SHE HAS
THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO FOYT
BACK AGAINST THE LIBERAL
MEDIA.
AND FOLKS, IT'S TRUE.
MICHELE BACHMANN NEEDS YOUR
DONATIONS BECAUSE TO THE
ONLY DOES THE MEDIA HAVE A
LIBERAL BIAS, BUT
