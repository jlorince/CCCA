DONE.
I'M BUSY WITH THE FRUIT.
NATION, WITH THE IOWA CAUCUS
THREE WEEKS A I WAY, NEWT
GINGRICH IS SITTING PRETTY.
WELL, HE'S SITTING.
HE'S GOT A DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD
NATIONALLY, FOLKS.
LAST NIGHT HIS MAIN RIVAL GOT A
GAME-CHANGING ENDORSEMENT FROM A
REPUBLICAN HEAVY HITTER.
>> CHRISTINE O'DONNELL WAS A TEA
PARTY FAVORITE DURING THE 2010
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.
SHE'S HERE TONIGHT TO ANNOUNCE
WHO SHE'S SUPPORTING FOR THE
G.O.P. NOMINATION.
>> I'M ENDORSING MITT ROMNEY.
>> Stephen: MITT ROMNEY IS
BACK IN IT.
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL'S
ENDORSEMENT WILL CAST A SPELL
OVER PRIMARY VOTERS.
>> I'M NOT A WITCH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THAT'S A BAD METAPHOR.
IN FACT, IN FACT, THIS
ENDORSEMENT PROVES SHE IS NOT A
WITCH BECAUSE A WITCH WOULD HAVE
GONE FOR THE EYE OF NEWTON.
AND WHAT, WHAT ABOUT MITT
BROUGHT O'DONNELL AROUND TO
ROMNEY?
>> HIS CONSISTENCY, THE FACT
THAT HE WAS SO STRONG AND I
THINK PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT
APPEALING GOING INTO THE 2012...
>> SOME PEOPLE SAY MITT ROMNEY
ISN'T THE MOST CONSISTENT
CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE'S CHANGED
HIS MIND ABOUT BIG, IMPORTANT
ISSUES OVER THE YEARS.
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
I LIKE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE'S
BEEN CONSISTENT SINCE HE CHANGED
HIS MIND.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: HOW DID SHE LOSE?
[LAUGHTER]
AND, FOLKS, SHE ISN'T THE ONLY
POLITICAL POWERHOUSE BACKING
ROMNEY.
SO THE DAN QUAYLE.
THANK GOD HE HAS THESE
ENDORSEMENTS BECAUSE RON PAUL
GOT JESSE VENTURA, WHICH
COUNTERACTED THE FACT THAT
MICHELE BACHMANN GOT WAYNE
NEWTON, WHO SHE NEEDED TO FIGHT
OFF THE FACT THAT RICK PERRY GOT
ENDORSED BY DEAN CAIN.
THAT HAD TO STING DEAN'S BROTHER
HERMAN.
BUT, OF COURSE, OF COURSE,
FOLKS, LIKE O'DONNELL, THE BEST
ENDORSEMENTS ARE FROM FORMER
CANDIDATES, AND WE STILL DO NOT
KNOW WHO RICK SANTORUM IS
ENDORSING.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT'S THAT?
HE'S STILL RUNNING?
[LAUGHTER]
REALLY?
OKAY.
SO HE'S PROBABLY ENDORSING
HIMSELF.
