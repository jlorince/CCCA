>> Stephen: YEAH!
WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOO!
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
LADIES AN GENTLEMEN.
TONIGHT --
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> OH, NATION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> NATION, WHAT CAN I SAY,
NATION, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
LISTEN.
FOLKS, YOU, YOU HAD ME AT STEPHEN, STEPHEN.
FOLKS, TONIGHT IS THE FINAL NIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL STROKEFEST.
THE HIGHLIGHT-- THE HIGHLIGHT TONIGHT OF COURSE IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIG
SPEECH WHERE HE WILL ACCEPT HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR A SECOND TERM.
NOW I HAVE NOT SEEN THE SPEECH, BUT I CAN TELL YOU IS A FAILURE.
(LAUGHTER) NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID,
BUT WHERE HE SAID IT.
JIM?
>> ORGANIZERS HAVE ALSO DECIDED THAT TOMORROW'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL HAVE TO MOVE INSIDE, SCRAPPING PLANS TO HOLD IT IN A HUGE FOOTBALL STADIUM.
>> HIS SPEECH IS NOW BEING MOVED HERE TO THIS SMALLER ARENA INDOORS.
THE CAMPAIGN SAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF STORMS AND LIGHTNING FORCING THE MOVE.
>> THEY MOVED IT INSIDE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FILL THE STADIUM, PERIOD.
>> PERIOD.
>> IT WASN'T THE WEATHER.
THEY KNEW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS GOING TO BE MONTHS AGO.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THEY KNEW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS GOING TO BE MONTHS AGO.
I MEAN ANYBODY CAN GO ON TO WEATHER.COM AND CHECK THE 100 DAY FORECAST.
(LAUGHTER) OKAY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING NEED MY WINDBREAKER ON DECEMBER 15TH.
NOW FOLKS, THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS SCANDAL, WHICH SOME ARE CALLING AVOIDING WATERGATE,
NOT MANY BUT SOME, JUST ME SO FAR--  (LAUGHTER) THE TRUTH IS THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT WANT THE
EMBARRASSING OPTICS OF A HALF FILLED STADIUM.
AND NOBODY WANTS TO LOOK UP AND SEE AN EMPTY SEAT.
JUST ASK THE REPUBLICANS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT-- THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME OBAMA AND THE
ATMOSPHERE HAVE JOINED FORCES.
RADIO HOST AND HUMAN WEATHER BALLOON RUSH LIMBAUGH BLEW THE LID OFF OF THIS LAST
WEEK WHEN HURRICANE ISAAC THREATENED THE GOP CONVENTION.
>> YOU GOT A HURRICANE COMING.
THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER WHICH IS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY, THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER IS OBAMA.
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE,
PART OF THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT, IT'S OBAMA.
>> Stephen: JUST CONNECT THE DOTS, FOLKS, OKAY.
ONE, OBAMA CAN MAKE AND OR IS A HURRICANE.
(LAUGHTER) TWO, HE CAN PREDICT THE WEATHER MONTHS IN ADVANCE.
THREE, I ALREADY HAD THIS FINGER UP AND I CAN'T PUT IT BACK.
OBAMA.
HE CONTROLS THE WEATHER.
I MEAN WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN,
ALL BLACK PEOPLE CAN CONTROL THE WEATHER.
(APPLAUSE) VERY INFORMATIVE DOCUMENTARY,
BY THE WAY.
IT'S WHERE I LEARNED THAT BALD PEOPLE CAN IMPLANT THOUGHTS IN YOUR MIND.
OUT OF MY HEAD, CARVILLE.
I DON'T WANT TO PICTURE MARY MATALIN LIKE THAT.
