NOW, SALINGER WAS FIERCELYPROTECT IF THE OF HIS PRIVACY SO
LET'S INVADE HIS PRIVACY IN PARTONE OF MY ONE-PART SERIES,
BETTER KNOW SALINGER.
>> J.D. SALINGER, THE WRITIN'J-D!  SALINGER WAS BORN IN --
SALINGER WAS BORN IN 1919 TOMIRIAM AND SAL, SALINGER, HE WAS
A MEDIOCRE STUDENT, ENDED UPFLUNKING OUT OF THE MCBURNEY
SCHOOL IN HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR,APPARENTLY HE HAD NOT READ THE
SOPHOMORE BOOK ASSIGNMENT MAINLYBECAUSE HE HADN'T WRITTEN IT
YET.  FROM THERE, SALINGER WENTON TO MILITARY SCHOOL AND WAS
EVENTUALLY DRAFTED INTO WORLDWAR II.
HE WAS ON UTAH BEACH ON D-DAY,HE FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF THE
BULGE AND LIBERATE ADDCONCENTRATION CAMP ALL THE WHILE
WRITING SHORT SERIES THE THEMESOF ALIENATION, DEPRESSION AND
LOS OF NEGLIGENCE.
WHAT AN IMAGINATION!  WHILE INGERMANY THE HALF JEWISH SALINGER
ARRESTED A YOUNG NAZI OFFICIALNAMED SYLVIA, WHO HE THEN
MARRIED AND BROUGHT TO AMERICA.
THE MARRIAGE LASTED ONLY EIGHTMONTHS AND ACCORDING TO
SALINGER'S DAUGHTER FOREVERAFTERWARDS SALINGER REFERRED TO
SYLVIA AS SALIVA.
WHICH WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY ASTHE KINDEST POSSIBLE WAY TO
INSULT A NAZI.
IN 1951, SALINGER RELEASED THECATCHER IN THE TRY, THE STORY OF
AN ADOLESCENT NAMED HOLDENCAULFIELD WHO SKIPPED OUT IN
SCHOOL, HEADS TO THE BIG CITY,WHERE HE GOES TO A JAZZ BAR,
LOOKS FOR DUCKS IN CENTRAL PARK,TAKES IN A MUSEUM, CATCHES A
CUBS GAME, JOINS A TWIST ANDSHOUT AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT
HOLDS, HIS DAD'S FERRARI FLIESOUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE
WOODS!
[ APPLAUSE ]>> SINCE THEN CATCHER HAS BEEN
FEATURED IN THE MODERN LIBRARYAND TIME MAGAZINE'S LIST OF 100
BEST NOVELS SELLING OVER65 MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THEJOY OF SEX SOLD ONLY 10 MILLION
COPIES WORLDWIDE AND THE CATCHERIN THE RYE HAS NO SEX, AND EVEN
LESS JOY.
>> NOTABLE FANS, NOTABLE FANS OFTHE CATCHER IN THE RYE INCLUDE
JOHN HINCKLEY, JR. WHO READ ITBEFORE SHOOTING RONALD REAGAN
AND MARK DAVID CHATMAN WHO READIT BEFORE SHOOTING JOHN LENNON,
IT IS THE MOST VIOLENT REACTIONTO A BOOK SINCE 1963'S TRAGIC
RASH OF POP HOPPING.
>> IN THE FINAL 45 YEARS OF HISLIFE, SALINGER DID NOT PUBLISH
ANY NEW MATERIAL DESPITEREPORTEDLY WRITING EVERY DAY.
THAT IS RIGHT.
HE WROTE THINGS WITHOUTIMMEDIATELY SHARING THEM WITH
THE WORLD AND I WILL GIVE YOU AMOMENT TO TWEET HOW STRANGE THAT
IS.
