>> Stephen: THANK YOU LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, LET'S GET RIGHT TOOUR TOP STORY TONIGHT.
I'VE GOT AN INCOMING NEWSFLASH.
I BELIEVE IN GOD.
AND FRANKLY, I HAVE HAD ITUP TO HERE WITH ATHEISTS,
THEY'RE SO SMUG ANDANNOYING.
AND IF THEY ARE CREATED INYOUR IMAGE, THEN YOU ARE A
JERK.
(LAUGHTER)>> BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
ATTACK OUR SACRED HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN BABY JESUS ASK IN SOMUCH DANGER THIS YEAR THAT
PROTECT HIS IDENTITY WE HAVETO CALL HIS BIRTHDAY X-MASS.
THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ONGRINCHITUDE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> FOLKS THE SECULAR
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> FOLKS THE SECULAR
PROGRESSIVES OUT THERE AREONCE AGAIN COMING AFTER OUR
CHRISTMAS DISPLAYS-- DISPLAYS.
I CAN'T EVEN PUT UP AREINDEER WITHOUT SOME GUY
TELLING ME TO GET OFF THEROOF OF TEMPLE BETH ELOHIM.
AND FOR THE LATEST ATTACK WEGO TO THE GRETCH WHO LOVED
CHRISTMAS.
>> REMEMBER THIS CLASSICSEINFELD MOMENT?
>> NO A NEARLY 6 FOOT TALLFESTIVUS POLL MADE OF
EMPTY BEER CANS ABOUT TO GOUP TO THE FLORIDA STATE
CAPITOL,.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, IN ADDITIONTO THE NATIVITY SCENE, THE
FLORIDA STATE CAPITOL HAS AFESTIVUS POLE, A MENORAH AND
A MONUMENT TO THE AZTECSNAKE GOODE GOVERNOR RICK
SCOTT.
SURELY, SURELY-- (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SURELY I AM NOTTHE ONLY ONE, I AM NOT THE
ONLY ONE WHO IS SO OUTRAGEDBY THIS.
>> I AM SO OUTRAGED BY THIS.
WHY DO I HAVE TO DRIVEAROUND WITH MY KIDS TO LOOK
FOR NATIVITY SCENES AND BELIKE OH, YEAH, KIDS, LOOK,
THERE'S BABY JESUS BEHINDTHEFESTIVUS POLE MADE OUT OF
BEER CANS.
IT'S NUTS.
AND I'M ALLERGIC.
>> YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TOLOOK THE A PILE OF BOTHER
CANS WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYINGTO SHOW YOUR KIDS POSITIVE
IMAGES LIKE LEAVING A BABYOUTSIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
WINTER.
BUT THAT WANE EVEN THE MOSTOUTRAGEOUS PART OF
GRETCHEN'S HOUR OF OUTRAGE.
>> WAIT A MINUTE,CHRISTIANITY STOLE THE
SEASON FROM THE SOLSTICE.
>> THAT A NEW HEADLINE FORME, THAT SOMEHOW CHRISTIANS
STOLE CHRISTMAS FROM THE -->> THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
WHAT IS NEXT, YOU'RE GOINGTO TELL ME THAT JESUS WAS
JEWISH, COME ON.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, I AM SO-- I WAS SO--
(APPLAUSE)I UNDERSTAND, THAT IS HOW
YOU KEEP JESUS ALIVE, YOUKEEP CLAPPING.
I WAS SO ENRAGED BY THISCLAIM THAT I DID SOMETHING
I'M NOT PROUD OF, RESEARCH.
IT TURNAL-- IT TURNS OUTOCCASIONALLY WE CHIST YENS
HAVE ABSORBED OTHER SEASONALTRADITION INTO OUR OWN.
FOR EXAMPLE, GIFT-GIVING WASDON'TED FROM A ROMAN
FESTIVAL.
CHRISTMAS TREES CAME FROMTHE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CUSTOM
WORSHIPPING THE GOD RA WITHA PALM RUSH AND SANTA IS
BASED ON A WAR LORD CRINGEELS THE UNJOLLY WHO LAID
WASTE TO HIS ENEMIES IN COALFIRE.
HE NOSE LIKE A CHEREE FROMTHE BLOOD OF THE VANQUISHED
WHOSE BODIES HE BURIED.
SO I SAY, WE SHOULD STOPTHESE ATHEISTS BY ABSORBING
THEIR FESTIVUS TRADITIONLIKE SOME SORT OF YULETIDE
BORG.
IT WILL BE EASY, AFTER ALL,JESUS WAS THE ORIGINAL
CHEREE.
THINK ABOUT T HE WAS ASINGLE GUY, HANGING OUT WITH
A COUPLE OF GUYS.
AND ONE WOMAN.
AND HE'S ALWAYS FOILED BYHIS NEMESIS, HELLO, JUDDAS.
