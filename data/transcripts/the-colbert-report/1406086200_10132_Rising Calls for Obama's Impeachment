(LAUGHTER)NOW, NATION, IF YOU'RE ANYTHING
LIKE ME, YOU GET ALL YOUR NEWSFROM ME.
I RECENTLY LEARNED A BOMBSHELLFROM MYSELF.
I WAS CATCHING UP ON OLDEPISODES OF "THE DAILY SHOW"
WHEN I CAME ACROSS SOMETHINGTHAT REALLY CAUGHT ME WITH MY
PANTS DOWN -- AND, YES, THAT'SHOW I WATCH THE DAILY SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S THAT GOOD.
AND THIS SEGMENT BLEW MY PANTSBACK ON.
>> JON, THIS IS GOING TO COMEAS SOMETHING OF A SHOCK TO YOU.
>> YOU'RE ENDING YOUR SHOW.
JON, PLEASE. I'M ENDING MY SHOW.
I HAVE TO, JON, DON'T BEG ME TOSTAY.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU SEE, THERE IS NO MOUNTAINLEFT FOR ME TO CLIMB.
IT'S BECOME CLEAR TO ME THATI'VE WON TELEVISION.
YES.
(APPLAUSE)"THE COLBERT REPORT," THANK
YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MY FRIENDS.
THANK YOU, NATION.
YES, "THE COLBERT REPORT" ISCOMING TO AN END.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Stephen:, NO, NO, DON'T BE
SAD.
I'LL STILL BE GREAT.
YOU JUST WON'T GET TO SEE ITANYMORE. THE TIME IS RIGHT.
I WON TELEVISION JUST IN TIMEFOR IT TO TURN INTO NETFLIX.
I'VE DONE ALL I SET OUT TOACCOMPLISH, SPOKE TRUTH TO
POWER, WON THE IRAQ WAR AND METTHE MOST INFLUENTIAL
SCANDINAVIAN HIP-HOP-SWINGFUSION GROUP OF 2009.
AND I HAVE BUT ONE REGRET --BARACK OBAMA WILL OUTLAST ME IN
OFFICE, WITH TWO YEARS OF NOCOLBERT TO REIN THIS MAN IN!
BY THE TIME HE LEAVES IN 2016,EVERYONE IN AMERICA WILL BE
POT-SMOKING GAY IMMIGRANTS IN APOLYGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH A
BIRACIAL BOX TURTLE!
(LAUGHTER)THANKFULLY, THERE IS ONE LAST
HOPE FOR STOPPING HIM.
>> CALLS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'SIMPEACHMENT ARE INCREASING.
>> PROMINENT OUTSIDECONSERVATIVE VOICES HAVE CALLED
FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO BEIMPEACHED.
>> IMPEACHMENT IS A MESSAGE THATHAS TO BE SENT TO OUR
PRESIDENT THAT WE'RE NOT GOINGTO PUT UP WITH THIS LAWLESSNESS.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN TRUSTSARAH PALIN ON IMPEACHMENT
BECAUSE SHE IS AN EXPERT OFLEAVING OFFICE IN THE MIDDLE OF
A TERM(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I SAY IT IS TIME TO DO THISTHING!
IMPEACHING IS WHAT REPUBLICANSDO BEST!
LET'S MAKE BARACK OBAMA JUST ASUNPOPULAR AS BILL CLINTON!
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ALL OFMY FELLOW CONSERVATIVES STAND
WITH SARAH -->> WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO
GOVERNOR PALIN?
>> I DISAGREE.
WHAT ABOUT THE FOLKS IN YOURCONFERENCE ROOM CALLING FOR
IMPEACHMENT?
>> I DISAGREE.
THINK SARAH PALIN IS WRONG.
LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE TIME FOR USTO GO INTO THAT EXERCISE.
>> WE ARE NOT WORKING ON ORDRAWING UP ARTICLES OF
IMPEACHMENT.
>> I THINK IT'S A DISTRACTIONTHAT'S NOT SHARED BY MOST
REPUBLICANS.
>> BUT I WANT TO IMPEACH HIMNOW!
I'VE ALREADY SENT OUT OFMY FLYERS FOR MY IM-PIZZA
PARTY!
(APPLAUSE)BUT, FOLKS, NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, I HAVE GOT TO KEEPTALKING ABOUT IT.
WE ALL HAVE GOT TO KEEP TALKINGABOUT IT BECAUSE IMPEACHMENT IS
A MONEYMAKER.
LOOK AT FORMER CONGRESSMAN ANDACTOR PLAYING GREY-HAIRED MAN IN
COMMUNITY THEATER ALLEN WEST.
IN A RECENT EMAIL TO SUPPORTERS,WEST WROTE, TODAY SARAH PALIN
JOINED TENS OF THOUSANDS OFCONSERVATIVES WHEN SHE CALLED
FOR IMPEACHMENT OF BARACK OBAMA.
IN LIGHT OF THIS GROWINGMOVEMENT, I'VE DECIDED TO OPEN
THE GUARDIAN FUNDS IMPEACHMENTSURVEY FOR A LIMITED TIME.
WILL YOU MAKE AN EMERGENCYCONTRIBUTION OF $5 OR MORE RIGHT
AWAY SO WE CAN GET THIS SURVEYINTO THE HANDS OF AS MANY
CONSERVATIVES AS POSSIBLE?
THAT IS A MAN YOU CAN TRUST.
HE'S GOT A VAGUE PLAN WHERE YOUDO ALL THE WORK AND PAY HIM $5.
SIGN ME UP!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOR THE RECORD, ANYONE OUT THERE
KEEPING SCORE, IT'S NOT JUST THEG.O.P.
DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO USINGIMPEACHMENT TALK TO GIN UP
DONATIONS LIKE THE DEMOCRATICCONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE
WHO SENT TWO E-MAILS WITHSUBJECTS LIKE "BREAKING
IMPEACHMENT" AND NETTED NEARLY10,000 DONATIONS IN JUST 24
HOURS.
WOW, TO MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEYTHAT FAST YOU USUALLY HAVE TO GO
ONTO KICKSTARTER AND SAY YOUWANT TO MAKE POTATO SALAD
