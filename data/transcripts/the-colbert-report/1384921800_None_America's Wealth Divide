(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT IS DOES NOT
NEED ANY HELP THROUGHOUT?
THE STOCK MARKET.
>> THE DOW IS UP 22%.
THE NASDAQ UP 31%.
THE S&P 500 UP 26%.
THE INDEX HAS GAINED MORE THAN 3POINTS THIS YEAR ALONE.
THE S&P 500 MOVED ABOVE1800 FOR THE FIRST TIME.
>> STOCK PRICES HIT NEWMILESTONES TODAY.
THE DOW TRADED ABOVE16,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.
>> Stephen: YES, THE DOW SET ANEW RECORD MEANING IT GOT TO
ENTER ITS INITIALS ON THEHIGH-SCORE SCREEN.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, THAT RECORD HIGH IS GOOD
FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLYWETIEST 5% OF AMERICANS WHO OWN
82% OF ALL STOCKS!
THE OTHER 95% HAVE THEIR MONEYINVESTED MOSTLY IN BEANIE BABIES
AND DONATED CANNED GOODS.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LOT OF WAL-MART FANS HERETONIGHT.
BUT NOW SOCIALIST COMMISSARSOVER AT THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL" ARE SAYING THE GULFBETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE
HAVE-NOTS MAY HURT THE ECONOMY.
WELL, THAT'S EXAGGERATING.
A GULF?
MY GATED COMMUNITY ONLY HAS AMOAT.
(LAUGHTER)NO SURPRISE THE REST OF THE RED
BRIGADE IS JOINING IN.
LIKE THAT MANAGER OF THE WORLD'SLARGEST BOND FUND WILLIAM GROSS.
>> ORDINARY FOLKS, THE 99%,DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY ANYMORE!
THE RICH 1% AND CORPORATIONS DO.
DEVELOPED ECONOMIES WORK BESTWHEN INEQUALITY AND INCOMES ARE
AT A MINIMUM.
>> Stephen: THAT IS A SOBERINGTHOUGHT.
