( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
COME ON, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GIVE ME
THAT KIND OF GREETING WHEN I
COME OUT HERE AT THE
BEGINNING OF SHOW IT'S LIKE
YOU'VE ALL GIVEN ME A
BILLING HUG.
AND I MEAN FULL BODY
CONTACT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT IS GOOD STUFF.
NOW FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU HAVE HEARD, BUT MITT
ROMNEY HAS BEEN HURT BY THE
SO-CALLED REPUBLICAN WAR ON
WOMEN.
WHICH OF COURSE IS JUST A
LIBERAL MEDIA INVENTION LIKE
GLOBAL WARMING OR THE FEMALE
ORGASM, WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE.
BUT UNLIKE OUR REAL WARS,
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS
ONE.
A RECENT POLL SHOWS OBAMA
LEADING ROMNEY AMONG WOMEN
BY 19 POINTS.
BUT OF COURSE THERE IS A
SIMPLE REASON FOR THAT.
I WILL LET THE CANE TRAIN
EX-- KANE TRAIN EXPLAIN.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS VERY
LIKABLE TO MOST PEOPLE IF
YOU JUST LOOK AT HIM AND HIS
FAMILY.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT HIS
POLICIES WHICH IS WHAT MOST
PEOPLE DISAGREE W IT'S A
DIFFERENT STORY.
AND I THINK MANY MEN ARE
MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE
FAILED POLICIES THAN A LOT
MORE OTHER PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YES.
OTHER PEOPLE THAN MEN.
THAT'S NOT PATRONIZING TO
WOMEN.
THAT COULD BE ANY KIND OF
OTHER PEOPLE.
CYBORGS, CASTROTOS.
THE LIST GOES ON FOR TWO.
BESIDES, THIS VERY WEEK MITT
ROMNEY TURNED THAT ATTACK
AGAINST OBAMA USING THE
ANCIENT ART OF JUMITSU.
>> THE REAL WAR ON WOMEN HAS
BEEN WAGED BY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE ON
THE ECONOMY.
THE REAL WAR ON WOMEN IS
BEING WAGED BY THE
PRESIDENT'S FAILED ECONOMIC
POLICIES.
>> OVER 92% OF THE JOBS LOST
UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WERE
LOST BY WOMEN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S CALLED
FLIPPING THE SCRIPT, BABY.
MY PROBLEM IS REALLY YOUR
PROBLEM.
IT'S ALL LAID OUT IN
ROMNEY'S NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN,
ROMNEY 20 12ING, I'M RUBBER
AND YOU'RE GLUE.
BUT IS ROMNEY'S ATTACK ON
OBAMA TRUE?
WELL, "THE WASHINGTON POST"
FACT CHECKER COLUMN LOOKED
INTO ROMNEY'S 92% CLAIM AND
JUDGED THIS FIGURE DOESN'T
MEAN VERY MUCH CONCLUDING
THE CLAIM WAS TRUE BUT FALSE.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU WASHINGTON POST.
YOUR REPORTING WAS HELPFUL
BUT USELESS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW UNFORTUNATELY, THE LADY
PUBLIC DIDN'T RESPOND TO
MITT REVERSE TAKEDOWN OF
OBAMA UNTIL THERE WAS A
CABLE NEWS MIRACLE.
WHEN DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN
STRATEGIST HILLARY ROSEN
CRITICIZED STAY AT HOME
MOTHER OF FIVE ANN ROMNEY.
>> WHAT YOU HAVE IS MITT
ROMNEY RUNNING AROUND THE
COUNTRY SAYING WELL, YOU
KNOW, MY WIFE TELLS ME THAT
WHAT WOMEN REALLY CARE ABOUT
ARE ECONOMIC ISSUES.
AND WHEN I LISTEN TO MY WIFE,
THAT'S WHAT I AM HEARING.
GUESS WHAT, HIS WIFE HAS
ACTUALLY NEVER WORKED A DAY
IN HER LIFE.
DID SHE PUT HER FOOT IN
OBAMA'S MOUTH.
EXCUSE ME T CAMPAIGN
STRATEGIST ROSEN, YOU KNOW
WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEVER
WORKED A DAY IN ITS LIFE?
ATTACKING MOTHERHOOD.
NOW FOLKS, FULL DISCLOSURE,
I HAVE A PERSONAL STAKE IN
THIS ISSUE.
BECAUSE I HAVE A MOM.
MY MOM.
WHICH MAKES ME HALF MOM ON
MY MOM'S SIDE.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW SHE WAS A STAY AT HOME
MOM OF 11 KIDS WHICH I GUESS
MAKES HER TWICE AS LAZY AS
ANN ROMNEY.
AND THESE REMARKS INFURIATE
ME, FOLKS.
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
>> DEMOCRATS ARE ATTACKING
STAY AT HOME MOMS.
SO WHO'S REALLY WAGING A WAR
ON WOMEN.
>> THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN.
>> TALKING ABOUT THE WAR ON
WOMEN, NOW THEY JUST GOT ONE
OF THEIR OWN ATTACKING STAY
AT HOME MOMS?
>> MANY DEMOCRATIC WOMEN
BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN BE A
WOMAN SO LONG AS YOU'RE LIKE
THEM.
>> THANKS, WE APPRECIATE IT.
>> Stephen: YEAH, THANKS.
WOMEN LIKE ME AND
CHRISTOPHER METZLER REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.
HMMMM.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS,
THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD, THE STORY IS
DELICIOUS.
JIMMY, PUT ROSEN'S QUOTE UP
ON THE CRAWL RIGHT NOW.
PUT IT UP THERE ALL THE
TIME.
THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
NOW PLAY THE QUOTE ON A
LOOP.
>> HIS WIFE HAS ACTUALLY
NEVER WORBLINGD A DAY IN HER
LIFE.
>> HIS WIFE HAS ACTUALLY
NEVER WORKED A DAY IN HER
LIFE.
>> NOW DROP A-- ON IT.
>> HIS WIFE HAS ACTUALLY
NEVER WORKED A DAY IN HER
LIFE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT IS CATCHY.
NOW SADLY MISS ROSEN HAS
SINCE APOLOGISED TO ANN
ROMNEY PROFUSELY.
DO WE HAVE THAT CLIP.
NO?
THEN WHAT DO WE HAVE
