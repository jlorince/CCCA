[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NATION... LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU
ABOUT RESCUED ARMY SERGEANT BOWEBERGDAHL AND THE GROWING CABLE
NEWS CONSENSUS THAT HE DOES NOTDESERVE TO BE ALIVE.
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHOWE GAVE UP FOR HIM.
>> FIVE TALIBAN KILLERS,ESSENTIALLY THE CABINET OF THE
TALIBAN.
>> IT'S NOT JUST ANY RANDOMACCUSED TERRORISTS BUT FIVE
TALIBAN COMMANDERS.
>> SOUTH CAROLINA SENATORLINDSEY GRAHAM IS CALLING THE
FORMER DETAINEES THE "TALIBANDREAM TEAM."
>> THE PRESIDENT SWAPPED ANALLEGED DESERTER FOR THE TALIBAN
DREAM TEAM.
>> THE TALIBAN DREAM TEAM.
>> THE DREAM TEAM.
>> WE GAVE UP THE DREAM TEAM.
GREAT!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]GREAT.
NOW WHO ARE WE GOING TO SEND TOTHE RIO OLYMPICS IN 2016?
ABDUL WAS DEADLY IN THE PAINT.
WELL, DEADLY PRETTY MUCHEVERYWHERE, BUT ESPECIALLY THE
PAINT.
MEANWHILE, BERGDAHL'S A DESERTERWHO DID BALLET, WHOSE DAD HAS A
BEARD AND WHO PURSUED ALIFESTYLE THAT 99% OF AMERICANS
CANNOT RELATE TO, VOLUNTEERINGTO FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN.
THE POINT IS: EVERYTHING ABOUTBERGDAHL IS AN AFFRONT TO THE
HEROS WHO SERVE ON THE FRONTLINES OF FOX NEWS.
>> BERGDAHL MAY HAVE EVENCOLLABORATED WITH THE ENEMY, THE
TALIBAN.
>> CLEARLY THE WORDS ARE WRITTENON THE WALL THAT HE WAS A
DESERTER.
>> A LOSER, A DESERTER WHO HASKILLED MEN.
>> HE'S A TRAITOR.
>> IT SEEMS TO ME HE'S PRETTYLUCKY HE WAS BROUGHT HOME THE
WAY HE WAS BECAUSE IF THOSESPECIAL FORCES HAD FOUND HIM, HE
WOULD HAVE COME HOME EITHER IN ABODY BAG OR COME HOME AND GONE
STRAIGHT TO JAIL.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, KIMBERLY.
IF OUR SOLDIERS HAD FOUND HIM,THEY MIGHT HAVE ARRESTED HIM,
BUT THEY JUST AS LIKELY WOULDHAVE MURDERED HIM IN A HEROIC
ACT OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE LIKE INTHE MOVIE
"FRAGGING PRIVATE RYAN."
[LAUGHTER]BUT EVEN MORE DISTURBING, EVEN
MORE DISTURBING THAN THE RESCUEOF THIS TRAITOROUS DESERTER WHO
DESERVED A FIELD EXECUTION ISTHE POSSIBILITY THAT HIS FIVE
YEARS OF TALIBAN CAPTIVITY MIGHTHAVE HAD SOME SAD PARTS THAT
MAKE HIM SYMPATHETIC.
>> BERGDAHL HAS TOLD MILITARYOFFICIALS HIS CAPTIVITY WAS A
TERRIFYING AND LONELY ORDEALWITH LONG PERIODS OF SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT THAT ONLY GOT WORSEWHEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE.
>> ARMY SERGEANT BOWE BERGDAHLIS TELLING HIS DOCTORS THAT THE
TALIBAN TORTURED AND BEAT HIMDURING FIVE YEARS OF CAPTIVITY.
>> DURING ALL THIS TIME, HESTRUCK TO HIS RELIGION,
CHRISTIANITY.
THE TALIBAN SAY THAT THEY GAVEHIM PERMISSION TO CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS.
>> Stephen: AND WORSE, WHILEHE WAS CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS,
THE TALIBAN WISHED HIM HAPPYHOLIDAYS.
FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.
HOW CAN BERGDAHL BE A GOODCHRISTIAN?
YOU DON'T SEE JESUS WALKING OFFINTO THE DESERT.
IS THERE ANY WAY... IS THERE ANYWAY WE CAN SAY THAT HIS TORTURE
WASN'T SO BAD?
>> HE DID, BERGDAHL, ADMIT THATHE WAS TORTURED BY THE TALIBAN
AND KEPT IN A CAGE AFTER ANATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IS WHAT HIS
ACCOUNT IS RELAYING RIGHT NOW.
>> YEAH, SO THAT WAS REPORTED ONFRIDAY THAT THEY HAD A
CUSTOMIZED CAGE WITH HIM ANDLEFT HIM IN THERE MAYBE IN
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
>> THIS GUY HAD HIS OWNCUSTOMIZED CAGE?
OH, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY BECONFINED IN AN OFF-THE-SHELF
CAGE.
I'M TOO FANCY FOR THAT.
I WANT ONE WITH BRUSHED STEELBARS AND A MONOGRAMMED POOP
BUCKET.
OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD START.
HE'S GOT FANCY CAGE.
BUT COULD WE MAKE IT SEEM LIKEHE ACTUALLY LIKED THESE GUYS?
>> IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE TOANYONE THAT HE WAS TORTURED AND
IT WAS HORRIFIC.
THERE WAS A REPORT TOO ON THISCHANNEL THAT BY THE END OF HIS
CAPTIVITY, HE WAS PLAYING SOCCERWITH THESE GUYS.
>> Stephen: PLAYING SOCCERWITH THESE GUYS?
FOR ALL WE KNOW THE TALIBAN'SMOM BROUGHT ORANGE SLICES.
IT SOUNDS FUN.
I'M BETTING GETTING CAPTURED WASCLEARLY HIS GOOOOOOOAL!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]BUT CAN WE PROVE THAT BEND IT
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]BUT CAN WE PROVE THAT BEND IT
LIKE BERGDAHL HERE IS ON THETALIBAN'S SIDE?
WELL, LUCKILY CNN FOUND A WAY TOBOIL THIS COMPLEX STORY DOWN TO
THE ONE QUESTION THAT MATTERS:DO YOU WATCH "HOMELAND"?
>> IT'S A STORY WITH SO MANYSUBPLOTS THAT NO WONDER MANY ARE
COMPARING BERGDAHL TO BRODY, THEFREED AMERICAN HOSTAGE ON
SHOWTIME'S "HOMELAND."
>> YOU ALMOST THINK YOU'REWATCHING "HOMELAND."
>> Stephen: YES, AND I'DALMOST THINK I WAS WATCHING THE
NEWS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]YOU SEE, BERGDAHL'S STORY IS
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]YOU SEE, BERGDAHL'S STORY IS
EXACTLY LIKE THE SHOWTIME DRAMA"HOMELAND" ABOUT A RESCUED
P.O.W. WHO MAY HAVE BEENBRAINWASHED BY ISLAMIC RADICALS.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THESIMILARITIES ARE NEARLY
EXISTENT.
>> LOOK AT THE SHOWS.
THERE WERE FAMILIES INVOLVED.
THERE WAS A REINTEGRATION BACKIN SOCIETY.
>> THE SHOW "HOMELAND"ORIGINATED IN ISRAEL. AND ISRAEL
HAD REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCE WITHTHESE PRISONER SWAPS.
HOPEFULLY HE WASN'T WATCHING"HOMELAND" AND MODELING HIS
STORY AFTER THAT BECAUSE ITDOESN'T END WELL FOR BRODY
YES, I CERTAINLY HOPE HEWASN'T WATCHING SHOWTIME IN HIS
CUSTOMIZED TALIBAN CAGE.
[APPLAUSE]OR WORSE, STARZ.
THAT IS TORTURE.
FOLKS, IT ALL LINES UP.
THEY BOTH HAVE FAMILIES.
THEY BOTH COME FROM SOCIETY.
HOMELAND ORIGINATED IN ISRAELAND BERGDAHL IS REAL.
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M TELLINGYOU, FOLKS, YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS
STUFF UP, ALTHOUGH WE WILLCONTINUE TO TRY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
