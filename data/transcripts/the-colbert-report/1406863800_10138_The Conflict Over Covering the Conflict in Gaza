NATION, I'VE JUST BEENINFORMED THAT STARTING
TOMORROW ISRAEL AND HAMASWILL BEGIN A 72 HOUR
HUMANITARIAN CEASE-FIRE.
THOUGH THEY HAVE AGREED INHOUR 73 TO RESUME THEIR
INHUMANITY. THIS CONFLICT INISRAEL HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR,
WHAT IS TODAY, JULY 31st,3,000 YEARS.
(LAUGHTER)AND WE'VE ALL BEEN
HEARTBROKEN BY THE HORRORSOF THIS WAR.
BUT NOW THERE HAVE BEENDISTURBING REPORTS OF DAMAGE
TO ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANTINTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,
ONE DIRECTION, WHO AREACCORDING TO CREDIBLE
REPORTS, DIVIDED OVER GAZA.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE DIRECTION-- (LAUGHTER)
ONE DIRECTION-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW HAS TWO DIRECTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN THIS MAKES ME
QUESTION A LOT OF MYPREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS.
I MEAN WHAT IF YOU DO KNOWTHAT YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL?
THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'RE NOLONGER BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN THIS COULD SUBVERTTHE ENTIRE FIELD OF BOY BAND
EPISTEMOLOGY.
OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHERVICTIMS OF THIS CONFLICT,
THE NEWS MEDIA.
WITH ACCUSATIONS OF BIASBEING HURLED FROM ALL SIDES,
REPORTERS, ANCHORS ANDPUNDITS ARE CAUGHT IN THE
CROSSFIRE.
THOUGH OF COURSE NOT CNN'SCROSSFIRE.
NOT EVEN U.N. INSPECTORSHAVE SEEN THAT SHOW.
JUST LISTEN, LISTEN TO SOMEOF THESE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS
THAT THE MEDIA HAS APRO-ISRAEL SLANT.
>> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
JUST A FEW OF THE ISRAELIPRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU'S INTERVIEWS ONAMERICAN NETWORKS IN RECENT
WEEKS.
>> BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ISBEEN ON TELEVISION SO MUCH
YOU WOULD THINK HE WAS ANANCHOR, A COANCHOR ON SOME
OF THESE SHOWS.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ANDISRAEL PROPAGANDISTS
ARE LARGELY GIVENCARTE BLANCHE TO SAY WHAT
THEY WANT ON AMERICANINFORMATION WITH LITTLE
PUSHBACK.
>> LOOK HOW MUCH AIR TIMENETANYAHU AND HIS FOLKS HAVE
ON AIR ON DAILY BASIS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE PALESTINIANBEING INTERVIEWED.
WE'RE RIDICULOUS.
WE ARE DISGUSTINGLY BIASEDWHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
I DO NOT SEE A PRO-ISRAELBIAS ON MSNBC OR ON CNN'S
THE SITUATION KIBBUTZ
BECAUSE GOD KNOWS CHARGES OFBIAS GO BOTH WAYS.
HERE IS HOW THEY SAY THEMEDIA'S ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS
WORKS.
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS CHARGETHAT WE HEAR FROM ISRAELI
LEADERS AND SOME OF THEIRSUPPORTERS IN THE MEDIA THE
PALESTINIANS DELIBERATELYDISPLAY DEAD BODIES TO SCORE
PROPAGANDA POINTS.
IS THAT A FAIR ALLEGATION.
>> YOU SEE THE PICTURE OFTHE CIVILIAN DESTRUCTION AND
THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.
SO IT'S ALMOST AN UNFAIRCOMPARISON WHEN YOU SEE
BODIES VERSUS TALKING HEADS.
>> THEY ARE LOSING THIS.
THEY ONLY HAVE THE FACE OFBENJAMIN NETANYAHU.
YOU CAN'T COMPETE WITH DEADBODIES.
>> Stephen: SHE'S RIGHT.
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WARWORKS.
WE ALL KNOW WHOEVER HAS THEMOST DEAD BODIES WINS.
(LAUGHTER)THANKFULLY, A GROUP CALLED
THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSINSTITUTE HAS STEPPED IN TO
END THE CONFLICT OVERREPORTING ON THIS CONFLICT.
IT'S A NONPROFIT THATPROMOTES PRESS FREEDOMS
AROUND THE WORLD.
AND IT HAS CREATED A HELPFULGUIDE TO COVERING THE
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICTCALLED USE WITH CARE, A
REPORTER'S GLOSSARY OFLOADED LANGUAGE.
>> I'VE GOT THE LIST RIGHTHERE, ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS THE ACTUAL LIST.
SO I CAN REPORT ON THECONFLICT WITHOUT USING ANY
SENSITIVE TRIGGER WORDS.
FOR INSTANCE, THE WORDTRIGGER.
(LAUGHTER)AND TO HELP ME DO THAT, I'VE
GOT MY INTERN JAY.
JAY THE INTERN, COME ON OUT,EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: OKAY, NOW, FOLKS,

COMPUTERIZED MONITORINGSYSTEM TO ALERT ME WITH THIS
VERY COMPUTERY RED COMPUTERLIGHT, IF I INADVERTENTLY

WILL ALERT ME.
NOW WITH THAT IN MIND, LET'SGET RIGHT TO THE LATEST FROM
THESE DISPUTED AREAS.
>> WHAT WAS THAT.
WHAT WAS THAT?
>> ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TOSAY DISPUTED AREAS.
THE GUIDE SAYS THERE ISTECHNICALLY A DISPUTE BUT
PRO PALESTINIANS FEEL THATREFERENCE TO DISPUTED AREAS
LEGITIMIZES THE ISRAELIGOVERNMENT'S CONTROL OF
THEM.
>> Stephen: OKAY.

THE AGGRESSION-- WAIT WHATDID I SAY.

DESCRIBE MILITARYOPERATIONS.
