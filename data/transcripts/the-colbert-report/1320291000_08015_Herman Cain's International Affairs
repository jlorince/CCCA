BIRTHDAY TONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
SOME TIME IN LATE WINTER MUST BE
A GOOD TIME FOR PARENTS TO GET
BUSY.
NATION, I'M SAD TO SAY THAT ONCE
AGAIN, THE BIG NEWS IS THE
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES
AGAINST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE HERMAIN CAIN.
SO, PARENTS, IF ANY CHILDREN ARE
WATCHING, PLEASE TELL THEM HOW
INTERCOURSE WORKS IN GRAPHIC
DETAIL.
, SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT.
( LAUGHTER ).
ARE THEY CRYING YET?
ARE YOU?
THEN YOU DIDN'T GO INTO ENOUGH
DETAIL.
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS, LET'S ALL REMEMBER THAT
CAIN IS ACCUSING OF DOING
NOTHING MORE THAN APPROACHING
FEMALE EMPLOYEES WITH PERSONAL
QUESTIONS OF A SEXUALLY
SUGGESTIVE NATURE AND MAKING
HAND GESTURES THAT WERE NOT
OVERTLY SEXUAL BUT THAT MADE
WOMEN WHO WITNESSED THEM
UNCOMFORTABLE.
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS, THESE DECADES-OLD
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CAIN ARE
JUST AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT US
FROM WHAT A GREAT PRESIDENT HE
WOULD BE.
CAIN UNDERSTANDS DOMESTIC ISSUES
BECAUSE HE HAD EXPERIENCE
SELLING PIZZA.
AND HE UNDERSTANDS INTERNATIONAL
ISSUES BECAUSE PIZZA IS ITALIAN.
( LAUGHTER )
AND HE HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO MY
SATISFACTION AN IN-DEPTH
KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN.
>> I'M READY FOR THE GOTCHA
QUESTION, AND WHEN THEY ASK ME
WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF
UBE-BEXY-STAN-STAN, I DON'T KNOW
KNOW.
>> Stephen:  YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF
UBECKY-BECKY-STAN-STAN IS, YOU
CAN JUST FIND OUT IN WIKIPEDIA,
WHICH I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE IS
THE COUNTRY JUST TO THE NORTH.
( LAUGHTER )
AND, FOLKS, ON MONDAY'S PBS "THE
NEWSHOUR" CAIN SHOWED HE IS
READY TO HAVE HIS FING OR THE
BUTTON.
>> I DO VIEW CHINA AS A
POTENTIAL THREAT UINDICATEING
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.
>> NATION, WE CANNOT ALLOW CHINA
TO DEVELOP NUKES.
ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY DEVELOPED
THEM IN 1964.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
I AM TELLING YOU, IF YOU DON'T
ACT FAST, THEY MIGHT END UP
BUILDING A WALL TO KEEP
FOREIGNERS OUT.
( LAUGHTER ).
NO!
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
THANKS, OBAMA.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, SOME OUT THERE MIGHT SAY
THAT CAIN MADE A GAFFE ABOUT
CHINA'S NUKES, BUT HE TOLD
HANNITY, HE IS STILL BONING UP
ON FOREIGN POLICY.
>> DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE THE
EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY,
CONSIDERING THAT HAS NOT BEEN
YOUR PROFESSIONAL AREA OF
EXPERTISE?
>> DO YOU THINK I'M DUMB ENOUGH
NOT TO STUDY UP ON THESE ?OOSHZ
I'VE BEEN STUDYINGUM ON THESE
ISSUES FOR MONTHS.
>> Stephen:  EXACTLY.
HE HAS BEEN STUDYING UP ON THESE
ISSUES FOR MONTHS.
HE JUST HASN'T WORKED HIS WAY UP
TO THE CHAPTER ON THE 1960s
YET.
PERSONALLY, I CANNOT WAIT TO
HEAR HIS PLAN ABOUT HOW HE'LL
GET US OUT OF VIETNAM.
SO STAY STRONG, HERMAIN CAIN.
AND IF YOU GET STUCK IN YOUR
NEXT INTERVIEW, REMEMBER, THE
