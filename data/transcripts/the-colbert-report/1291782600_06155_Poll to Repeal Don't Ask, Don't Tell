>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
AS YOU KNOW, I AM A HUGE
SUPPORTER OF THE MILITARY'S
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" POLICY.
IT IS A TESTAMENT OF AMERICANS
TOLERANCE OF ALL PEOPLE WE NEVER
FIND OUT ARE GAY.
IN FACT, I BET I'M TOLERATING
UNNON-GAYS MANY MY AUDIENCE
RIGHT NOW.
LET'S SEE.
IF YOU'RE GAY, DON'T TELL ME.
COULD BE ALL OF THEM, YET I'M
FINE WITH NOT KNOWING THAT.
BUT LAST WEEK SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE GATES WENT BEFORE
CONGRESS TO ASK THAT "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL" BE REPEALED.
>> I STRONGLY URGE THE SENATE TO
PASS THIS LEGISLATION AN SEND IT
TO THE PRESIDENT FOR SIGNATURE
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.
I BELIEVE THIS HAS BECOME MATTER
OF SOME URGENCY.
>> Stephen: "SOME URGENCY"?
WHERE'S THE FIRE, BOB?
DO HOMOSEXUALS HAVE AN
EXPIRATION DAY?
BEST IF GAY BY?
EVEN INDEPENDENT SENATOR AND
HUMAN PUFF PASTRY JOE LIEBERMAN
RECENTLY TWEETED, "KEEP SENATE
IN SESSION UNTIL "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL" REPEALED."
IF NOT NOW WHEN?
I COUNTER-TWEET, IF WHEN, NOT
NOW.
FOLKS, THE MILITARY IS NOT YOUR
NORMAL WORKPLACE.
SUDDENLY ALLOWING OPENLY GAY
SOLDIERS IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS
ALLOWING KHAKIS ON FRIDAYS.
BY THE WAY, THE GUYS WHO SHOW UP
WITH NON-PLEATED KHAKI, DON'T
ASK.
YOU SEE, A FIGHTING FORCE HAS TO
PRESERVE SOMETHING CALLED UNIT
COHESION, WHICH IS MILITARY
SPEAK FOR NO GAY GUYS.
WHEN YOU'RE IN COMBAT, THE
NUMBER ONE THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND
AS BULLETS ARE WHIZZING OVERHEAD
IS I HOPE THE GUY WHO JUST SAVED
MY AS WASN'T SAVING IT FOR
LATER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, A PENTAGON STUDY, A
PENTAGON STUDY CAME OUT LAST
WEEK THAT SAID THAT 70% OF
SERVICE MEMBERS WHO HAVE LITTLE
OR NO PROBLEM IF "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL" WAS REPEALED.
BUT THE STUDY IS CLEARLY BIASED.
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, THAT 70%
WHO HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH GAY
TEEM HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH GAY
PEOPLE.
CHANGING THE POLICY REALLY
AFFECTS 100% OF THE 30 PRESIDENT
CLINTON WHO DO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH GAY PEOPLE.
AN OUR MILITARY REDNESS WOULD BE
UNDERMINED BY THEIR VAGUELY
DEFINED DISCOMFORT.
BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
JUST ASK FORMER WAR HERO AND
CURRENT FORMER WAR HERO JOHN
McCAIN.
HE POINTED OUT THE STUDY'S FATAL
FLAW.
>> I'M REALLY KIND OF TAKEN
ABACK AT THE SECOND DAUGHTER'S
STATEMENT THAT WE WON'T HAVE A
"REFERENDUM" BY THE MEN AND
WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.
I NEVER MADE A MAJOR DECISION IN
THE MILITARY WITHOUT GOING
AROUND AND TALKING TO THE
ENLISTED PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE HAVING THE
TROOPS VOTE ON EVERYTHING THE
MILITARY DOES IS STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE.
REMEMBER HOW GENERAL PATTEN BEAT
THE NAZIS.
>> WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN
VOTING ON ANYTHING EXCEPT THE
ENEMY.
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ON THE HIM
BY THE NOSE, AND WE'RE GOING TO
KICK HIM IN THE ASS.
WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE HELL OUT
OF HIM ALL THE TIME, AN WE'RE
GOING TO GO THROUGH HIM LIKE
CRAP THROUGH A GOOSE.
>> Stephen: [AS PATTEN]: IF
THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
SO WE'VE GOT TO POLL EVERYONE IN
THE MILITARY, FROM TOP GENERALS
TO THE TROOPS, EVERYONE WHO IS
INVOLVED, PEOPLE WHO SUPPLY THE
BASE, MILLION TEAR CONTRACTORS,
CIVIL WAR RE-ENACTORS AND
TEN-YEAR-OLDS PLAYING RISK IN
THEIR BASEMENT.
IF EVEN ONE OF THEM OBJECTS TO
REPEALING "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL," JOHN McCAIN AND I
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S TOO SOON.
AND IF NO ONE IN OUR MILITARY
WANTS TO DENY GAYS THE RIGHT TO
FIGHT AND DIE FOR THEIR COUNTRY,
THEN I SAY WE NEED TO ASK PEOPLE
WHO DO SHARE OUR TRADITIONAL
ANTI-GAY VALUES, THE TALIBAN.
IT'S ONLY FAIR.
AFTER ALL, IT'S
