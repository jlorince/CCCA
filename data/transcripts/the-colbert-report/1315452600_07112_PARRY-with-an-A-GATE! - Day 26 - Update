WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, BEFORE OUR AUGUST BREAK,
I WAS TRYING TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE HUGE SCANDAL
ROCKING THE REPUBLICAN RACE FOR
PRESIDENT.
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
RUMOR THAT CANDIDATE THADDEUS
McCOTTER'S REAL NAME IS COTTER
McTHADDEUS.
NEW YORK I'M TALKING ABOUT
IOWA'S PARRY-WITH-AN-A GATE.
YOU ALL KNOW THE DETAILS.
OH, YEAH.
BUT IN CASE YOU'RE SOME SORT OF
CAVE MAN JUST THAWED FROM A
MILLION-YEAR ICY SLEEP, LET ME
CATCH YOU UP.
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS TV.
TV GOOD.
SECONDLY, THE COLBERT NATION AND
I RECENTLY FORMED COLBERT SUPER
PAC, ALLOWING US TO RAISE AND
SPEND UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF
MONEY.
TECHNICALLY MY LAWYER SAYS WE'RE
LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN THE
WORLD, BUT HE'S WORKING ON THAT.
NOW, WE USED OUR MONEY FOR THE
FIRST TIME TO RUN ADS IN ADVANCE
OF THE IOWA STRAW POLL
SUPPORTING WRITING IN TEXAS
GOVERNOR RICK PERRY, AND TO
DISTINGUISH OURSELVESES FROM THE
OTHER SUPER PAC SUPPORTING
PERRY, WE ASKED SUPPORTERS TO
WRITE IN HIS NAME WITH AN A, AND
IF THEY'RE FEELING REALLY
AMBITIOUS, DOT THE "I" IN RICK
WITH ANOTHER "A."
RICK PARRY CAME IN SIXTH OVER
ALL AND WAS THE NUMBER-ONE WRITE
IN CANDIDATE WITH 718 VOTESMENT
BUT FOLKS, EVERY SILVER LINING
HAS A DARK CLOUD.
THE IOWA G.O.P. HAS REFUSED TO
RELEASE THE WRITE-IN RESULTED,
SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF
THOSE 718 VOTES WERE WITH AN A.
WAS IT 717?
AS LOW AS 716?
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
SO I TURNED TO THE COBAIL
REPORT'S AFFILIATE IN IOWA,
WOI ABC 5 WHERE DES MOINES TURNS
FOR DES NEWS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE
NEWS TEAM.
CO-AN CORES AMANDA KRANZ AND
CHIEF METEOROLOGIST BRAD EDWARDS
CERTIFIED AS CENTRAL'S MOST
ACCURATE METEOROLOGIST FOR FIVE
YEARS AND WHO'S COUNTING?
LET'S NOT FORGET INTREPID CUP
REPORTER KATIE EASTMAN, WHOSE
PROVEN TRACK RECORD GARNERS ALL
THE PLUMB ASSIGNMENTS.
>> JESSICA, IOWA STATE STUDENTS
HAVE A LONG LIST OF PARKING
COMPLAINTS, BUT NEXT WEEK THERE
WILL BE A NEW PROGRAM THAT COULD
MAKE DRIVING PLACES MORE
CONVENIENT.
>> Stephen: NOW IF ONLY IOWA
WOULD COME UP WITH A PLACE FOR
PEOPLE TO GO.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL,, I WAS AWAY... I WAS AWAY
FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT I AM
CONFIDENT WOI WAS HARD AT WORK
TEARING THE LID OFF THIS SCANDAL
BECAUSE THEY SENT ME AN UPDATE
IN THE FORM OF AN E-MAIL TODAY
FROM WOI STATION MANAGER AND MY
MEN'S ROOM EMMY FLUFFER RAY COLE
THAT'S JUST... LET'S JUST GIVE
IT A READ HERE.
OKIE SMOKY.
ALL RIGHT.
IT STARTS OUT, STEPHEN.
GOOD STARTED.
THAT'S ME.
"ABC 5 NEWS'S AMANDA KRENZ
QUESTIONED WHETHER OR NOT THE
STRAW POLL RESULTS MIGHT BE
SUBJECT TO A TBEED OF
INFORMATION ACT REQUEST.
THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO.
THE LONG ANSWER IS NNNNNNNNNNNO.
IS THAT IT?
MAYBE IT'S CONTINUED ON THE
OTHER SIDE.
IS THERE ANYTHING?
DAMN.
OKAY.
WELL, STILL, I WANT TO THANK
EVERYBODY AT THE WOI NEWS TEAM,
PARTICULARLY THEIR NEW
INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST WHO IS
APPARENTLY A MAGIC 8 BALL.
WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU GUYS
