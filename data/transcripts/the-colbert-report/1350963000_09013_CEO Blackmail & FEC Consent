VOTING FOR THE SAME GUY TWICE IS
A FEDERAL CRIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOR OBAMA, AFTER THE WAY HE HAS
CYNICALLY ENGAGED IN CLASS
WARFARE.
>> WHEN GOVERNOR ROMNEY SAYS HE
HAS A FIVE-POINT PLAN-- GOVERNOR
ROMNEY DOESN'T HAVE A FIVE-POINT
PLAN, HE HAS A ONE-POINT PLAN.
AND THAT PLAN IS TO TO MAKE SURE
PEOPLE AT THE TOP PLAY BY A
DIFFERENT SET OF RULES.
>> STEPHEN: OH PLEASE, MR.
PRESIDENT, EVERYONE PLAYS BY THE
SAME SET OF RULES, AND AT THE
END OF THE GAME, THE RICH FLIP
THE BOARD OVER AND YELL "I WIN."
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, LUCKILY, SOME OF AMERICA'S
TOP CEO'S ARE ASSURING A ROMNEY
VICTORY BY DOING THE
UNTHINKABLE: TALKING TO THEIR
EMPLOYEES.
>> DAVID SIEGEL IS THE OWNER OF
THE LARGEST PRIVATELY HELD
TIMESHARE COMPANY IN THE WORLD,
A BILLIONAIRE.
HE SENT THIS E-MAIL TO HIS 7,000
EMPLOYEES SAYING, QUOTE, "IF ANY
NEW TAXES ARE LEVIED ON ME OR MY
COMPANY, AS OUR CURRENT
PRESIDENT PLANS, I WILL HAVE NO
CHOICE BUT TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF
THIS COMPANY.
THIS MEANS FEWER JOBS, LESS
BENEFITS AND CERTAINLY LESS
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE.
>> THIS IS AN EMAIL FROM ARTHUR
ALLEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ASG
SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS.
SUBJECT: WILL THE US PRESIDENTAL
ELECTION DIRECTLY IMPACT YOUR
FUTURE JOBS AT ASG?
I CAN TELL YOU IF THE US
REELECTS PRESIDENT OBAMA, OUR
CHANCES OF STAYING INDEPENDENT
ARE ARE SLIM TO NONE.
IF WE FAIL AS A NATION TO MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICE AND WE LOSE OUR
INDEPENDENCE AS A COMPANY, I
DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE FALLOUT
THAT WILL MOST LIKELY COME.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH.
IF THESE CEOs OR THEIR COMPANIES
HAVE THEIR TAXES RAISED, YOU
EMPLOYEES WILL LOSE YOUR JOBS.
WHICH WOULD BE TERRIBLE, BECAUSE
THEN YOU COULDN'T WORK AT THAT
GREAT PLACE WHERE YOUR BOSS
THREATENS YOU!
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW SOME CALL THIS CEO
BLACKMAIL.
BUT, FOLKS, I JUST CALL IT
EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY WASTE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS ON SUPER PAC ADS THAT
MAY OR MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE,
WHEN YOU CAN DELIVER A MESSAGE
THAT WILL REALLY HIT HOME --
"VOTE FOR ROMNEY OR YOU'LL LOSE
YOUR HOME."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR THE
EMPLOYEES.
AS WESTGATE TIMESHARE CEO DAVID
SIEGEL TOLD BLOOMBERG BUSINESS
WEEK, QUOTE, "I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED
OUT FOR THEIR BEST INTERESTS.
WE'RE LIKE A FAMILY.
THEY'RE LIKE MY CHILDREN, AND
I'M THE JEWISH MOTHER TELLING
THEM TO EAT THEIR SPINACH AND
VOTE FOR ROMNEY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY.
A CORPORATION IS LIKE A BIG
FAMILY AND DAVE SIEGEL IS JUST A
JEWISH MOM TELLING YOU "EAT YOUR
SPINACH, BUBALA, OR I WILL
FINISH THE JOB THE MOHEL
STARTED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND NOW THANKS TO AN AUGUST FEC
RULING, JOB CREATORS HAVE AN
EVEN MORE POWERFUL TOOL AT THEIR
DISPOSAL.
SEE, BACK IN 2010, TWO EMPLOYEES
OF THE UNITED PUBLIC WORKERS
UNION WERE ALLEGEDLY FIRED AFTER
"REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH A UPW
REQUEST TO SIGN-WAVE, PHONE
BANK, CANVASS AND CONTRIBUTE TO
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL
CANDIDATE COLLEEN HANABUSA'S
CAMPAIGN."
THAT IS SHOCKING.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET FIRED FROM
A UNION JOB.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE CASE WAS BROUGHT TO THE FEC,
WHO DEADLOCKED 3-3 ALONG PARTY
LINES WHICH, BY FEC RULES MEANS
IT ISN'T LEGAL OR ILLEGAL, WHICH
REALLY MEANS IT'S LEGAL.
SAME WAY THAT IF YOU SAY
(speaking rapidly)
"MOM-CAN-I-HAVE-A-COOKIE?" AND
SHE SAYS, "WHAT?" THAT MEANS
YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THE REPUBLICAN COMMISIONERS
WROTE THAT IN A POST-CITIZEN'S
UNITED WORLD
"REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WORK ON
INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES FOR
EITHER THE UNION OR A SUPER PAC
IS NOT A VIOLATION OF THE ACT OR
COMMISSION REGULATIONS."
WHICH MEANS, A CEO CAN NOW
REQUIRE HIS EMPLOYEES TO
CAMPAIGN FOR THE CANDIDATE OF
HIS CHOICE, AND THE EMPLOYEE HAS
NO CHOICE.
IT'S JUST ANOTHER JOB DUTY.
LIKE "HAVE THAT REPORT ON MY
DESK BY FIVE."
"CHANGE THE PRINTER TONER."
"GO TO OHIO AND STAND BEHIND
ROMNEY WHILE BEING BLACK."
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BIG FANS OF BEING BLACK TONIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, FOLKS, I'VE GOT A STAFF OF
ALMOST 100.
MOST OF THEM ARE HIPSTER
BROOKLYNITES WHO NEED OBAMACARE,
BECAUSE INSURANCE CONSIDERS
STUPID MUSTACHES A PRE-EXISTING
CONDITION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THANKS TO THE FEC, THEY'RE
NOT HUMANS, THEY'RE JUST COMPANY
ASSETS THAT I MAY LEGALLY
DONATE.
JAY, GET YOUR ASSET OUT HERE.
JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.
ALL RIGHT.
GREAT NEWS, JAY!
I'M NOW PAYING YOU--
>> OH, AWESOME!
>> STEPHEN: -- TO GO TO OHIO AND
KNOCK ON DOORS FOR MITT ROMNEY.
>> WHAT?
I'M VOTING FOR OBAMA.
>> STEPHEN: SHH!
NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE
VOTING FOR.
THE SECRET BALLOT IS THE BEDROCK
OF OUR LIBERTY.
NOW GET IN THE CRATE.
GO ON.
COME ON, GET MOVING.
GET IN.
ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY.
THERE YOU GO.
DON'T WORRY, JAY IT'S SECOND-DAY
AIR.
OKAY?
GOT SOME AIR HOLES FOR YOU
THERE, BUDDY.
OKAY?
[HAMMERING]
HOW ARE THOSE AIR HOLES, JAY?
>> FINE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN
HERE TO EAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: GETTING HOT IN
THERE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS!
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.
THANK YOU, FEC OR WHOEVER
EMPLOYS THE FEC AND MADE THEM
VOTE THIS WAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
