GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! INHERE OUT THERE, ALL AROUND
THE WORLD, ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE!
NATION, TODAY IS THE FIRSTMONDAY IN OCTOBER, THE START OF
THE SUPREME COURT'S NEW SESSION,AND I AM PUMPED TO THE GAVELS.
IT'S LIKE THE START OF FOOTBALLSEASON, ONLY, UNLIKE THE N.F.L.,
THESE PLAYERS ACTUALLY GO TOCOURT.
(LAUGHTER)AND RIGHT HERE ON DAY ONE, THE
COURT'S ALREADY DECIDED ON AHUGE NON-DECISION.
>> THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID ITWILL NOT HEAR ANY OF THE SEVEN
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CASES THATWERE FILED OVER THE SUMMER.
>> NOW THE LOWER COURT RULINGSSTAND.
>> IN MOST OF THESEJURISDICTIONS NOW, SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE WILL BE DE FACTO LEGAL.
>> NOW WE ARE IN A SITUATIONWHERE 30 STATES HAVE SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE.
APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THEAMERICAN PEOPLE LIVE IN A STATE
WITH SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
>> THE MOMENTUM WHEN YOU HAVETHAT MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN A
WORLD WHERE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE ISLEGAL MAKES IT INEVITABLE, IT
SEEMS, THAT THE REST OF THECOUNTRY WILL FOLLOW.
>> STEPHEN: INEVITABLE THATTHE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL
FOLLOW.
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S IT.
(LAUGHTER)I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK MY WIFE
LORRAINE FOR 25 GOOD YEARS.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: WHAT CAN I SAY?
WE GAVE IT A GOOD SHOT, HONEY.
AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET APHOTO OF YOU.
AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME MY NEWGOVERNMENT-MANDATED LIFE PARTNER
ROGER CORNSWORTH.
(LAUGHTER)ROG AND I ARE REGISTERED AT
RESTORATION HARDWARE.
WE'RE DOING OUR ENTIRE LIVINGROOM IN HAMMERED STAINLESS
STEEL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FOR NOW, FOLKS, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE CASES THAT THE COURTHAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO HEAR.
SPECIFICALLY, HOW THEY WILL BEARRIVING AT THEIR DECISIONS.
I READ ALL ABOUT IT IN THEVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW.
I'M A LONG-TIME SUBSCRIBER.
I USE IT TO HIDE MY HUSTLERS.
THE ARTICLE WAS BY WILLIAM ANDMARY SCHOOL OF LAW PROFESSOR
ALLISON ORR LARSEN.
IN IT, ALLISON, OR LARSEN, I'MNOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS, BLOWS
THE LID OFF THE SUPREME COURT'SRELIANCE ON SOMETHING CALLED
AMICUS CURIAE ORFRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEFS,
INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS WRITTENBY THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE NOT
INVOLVED IN THE SITUATION, WHOSEOPINION WAS NOT SOUGHT, BUT
STILL WANT SOME SAY IN THEDECISION.
IT'S THE LEGAL EQUIVALENT OFGRANDPARENTS.
(LAUGHTER)AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SOME
ESTABLISHED EXPERT TO INFLUENCETHE COURT.
FOR INSTANCE, IN A 2013DECISION, JUSTICE STEPHEN G.
BREYER CITED AN AMICUS BRIEF TOESTABLISH THAT AMERICAN
LIBRARIES HOLD 200 MILLION BOOKSTHAT WERE PUBLISHED ABROAD...
THE FIGURE CAME FROM A BLOGPOST.
THE BLOG HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.
(LAUGHTER)SO WHAT IF IT'S DISCONTINUED?
I GET ALL MY LEGAL RESEARCH FROMCACHED GEOCITIES PAGES.
FROM THE 1990S!
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S HOW I KNOW --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT'S HOW I KNOW IT IS MY
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO GETJIGGY WID GILLIAN ANDERSON.
(LAUGHTER)AND IN CARHART V. GONZALES,
JUSTICE KENNEDY WROTE THAT WOMENWHO GET ABORTIONS CAN SUFFER
SEVERE DEPRESSION AND LOSS OFESTEEM.
QUOTING AN AMICUS BRIEF CITINGTHE WORK OF DR. DAVID REARDON,
WHO IS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERWHO HOLDS A PH.D. IN BIOETHICS
FROM AN UNACCREDITED AND NOWNON-EXISTENT SCHOOL IN HAWAII.
(LAUGHTER)(AUDIENCE REACTS)
WELL, I SAY ITS LACK OFEXISTENCE IS IRRELEVANT, AND I
HAVE A DOCTORATE IN EXISTENTIALPHILOSOPHY FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF NARNIA ONLINE.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERING)
AND THESE ARE NOT ISOLATEDINCIDENTS, ACCORDING TO LARSEN.
THE NUMBER OF AMICUS CURIAEBRIEFS FILED AT THE SUPREME
COURT IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.
AND FROM 2008 TO 2013, THECOURT'S OPINIONS CITED FACTUAL
ASSERTIONS FROM AMICUS BRIEFS124 TIMES.
WELL, AS A WISE MAN ONCE SAID,THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
QUOTING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOWWHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT?
I DID.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERING)
BUT I SAY WHY LIMIT THE COURT TOAMICUS BRIEFS WHEN THERE ARE SO
MANY SOURCES FOR UNVERIFIEDFACTS?
WHAT ABOUT SNAPPLE CAPS?
(LAUGHTER)YOUR HONOR, ALABAMA SEEKS A
PRECEDENT IN ITS ABILITY TOREDRAW CONGRESSIONAL VOTING
DISTRICTS BECAUSE...
EMUS CAN'T WALK BACKWARDS.(LAUGHTER)
TASTES LIKE THE TRUTH.
