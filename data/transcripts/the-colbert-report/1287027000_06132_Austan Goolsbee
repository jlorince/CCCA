EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CHAIRMAN OF
THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS, BUT HIS DREAM
JOB IS ON THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS.
PLEASE WELCOME AUSTAN GOOLSBEE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. GOOLSBEE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
>> IT'S A PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE
HERE YOU WERE NOT THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC
ADVISER.
NOW YOU ARE.
IT'S CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP.
NOW ARE YOU LIKE THE JOINT
CHIEFS BUT FOR NONE?
CAN YOU... DO YOU HAVE A BIG RED
BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN LAUNCH
SOMETHING?
>> NO, WE'RE NOT REALLY IN
CHARGE OF ANYTHING.
IT'S MORE LIKE THE PRESIDENT'S
DATA HUNTER AND GATHERERS AND
INTERNAL THINK-TANK.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU... THE
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO LET THE
CORE OF THE BUSH TAX CUTS SUNSET
AT THE END OF THIS YEAR.
AND THE TOP 1% OF AMERICANS ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A LOT MORE
MONEY.
RIGHT?
>> WELL, HE WANTS TO EXTEND THE
98% OF THE TAX CUTS...
>> Stephen: BUT THE TOP 1%,
THE GUYS LIKE ME, GUYS LIKE ME
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY MORE
MONEY, CORRECT?
>> ON THE PART OF YOUR INCOME
ABOVE $250,000.
>> Stephen: BACK TO WHAT IT
WAS UNDER CLINTON.
>> BACK TO WHAT IT WAS UNDER
CLINTON.
>> Stephen: THE BAD OLD DAYS
UNDER CLINTON.
THE DEPRESSION.
YOU EXPLAINED THIS WITH A WHITE
BOARD DEMONSTRATION RECENTLY,
WHICH IS UP ON THE YOUTUBE.
THERE IS THE G.O.P. PLAN.
THIS IS HOW MUCH TAXES WOULD BE
CUT.
AND UP THERE YOU HAVE ALL THE
RICH PEOPLE ABOVE $1 MILLION,
WHO EVIDENTLY FROM THE
DEMONSTRATION LOOK LIKE THEY OWN
JUPITER.
( LAUGHTER )
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME AS QUICKLY AS
YOU CAN.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT FORTH
WITH THIS KIND OF PROPAGANDA?
>> WELL, THIS WAS JUST TRYING TO
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRESIDENT'S
PLAN WOULD GIVE A TAX CUT TO
EVERYBODY ON THE FIRST $250,000
OF INCOME.
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THIS
PLAN, WHICH WOULD BE NEEDED AND
GIVE RELIEF TO 98% OF PEOPLE
WOULD FACE NO TAX INCREASE AT
ALL, IS GETTING HELD UP SO THAT
A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE
CAN GET A VERY BIG TAX CUT.
>> Stephen: BUT ISN'T THIS
CLASS WARFARE.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WELL CERTAINLY
IT'S PARTISAN.
LOOK, YOU MADE...
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU MADE THE RICH
PEOPLE RED.
BAD GUYS ARE RED, FIRE RED, BAD
RED, EMERGENCY RED, ABSOLUTELY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE US GREEN?
THAT'S THE NATURAL COLOR FOR US.
>> RED IS A PRIMARY COLOR.
GREEN IS NOT A PRIMARY COLOR.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE COLOR.
I'M NOT A RACIST.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S RED?
>> Stephen: I HAVE A STAFF
THAT TOLD ME THAT WAS RED.
DON'T TRY TO TRICK ME WITH YOUR
ECONOMIC TRICKS.
>> WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT ABOUT
THIS.
>> Stephen: POINT IT OUT.
>> TO GIVE THAT BIG RED CIRCLE
WILL COST $700 BILLION.
>> Stephen: AND WE RICH PEOPLE
WILL PUT THAT RIGHT BACK INTO
THE MARKET.
WE WILL PUT IT RIGHT BACK INTO
THE MARKET BY INVESTING IN
CHINESE PAPER MILLS AND INDIAN
TECH COMPANIES.
>> LOOK, WE DID THAT IN 2001.
IT DIDN'T WORK.
WHY DO THAT AGAIN.
>> Stephen: WE HAD EIGHT YEARS
OF PROSPERITY AFTER THAT?
DIDN'T WE?
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT RICH IN THE
LAST TEN YEARS.
DON'T REWRITE HISTORY, MY
FRIEND.
>> IT WAS FIRST BOOM IN RECORDED
U.S. ECONOMIC HISTORY IN WHICH
THE MIDDLE CLASS'S INCOME FELL
BY $2,000 OVER WHAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BOOM AND IT WAS FOLLOWED
BY THE WORST RECESSION SINCE
1929.
IT DIDN'T WORK.
>> Stephen: I DID FINE.
I DID FINE.
AND I'M MIDDLE CLASS.
I'M MIDDLE CLASS.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?
MAYBE THOSE PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T
WORK HARD ENOUGH.
DON'T YOU BELIEVE IN THE FREE
MARKET?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IS THIS FREE
MARKET?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW?
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE FREE THE TAKE
WHATEVER JOB YOU WANT.
>> Stephen: NO OTHER WESTERN
INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY HAS A
PROGRESSIVE TAX RATE WHERE THE
RICH GET TAXED MORE THAN ANYONE
ELSE.
NAME ONE OTHER COUNTRY.
>> FRANCE, THE U.K.
>> Stephen: I SAID ONE.
I SAID ONE.
I THINK YOU LOST THAT.
>> WE'LL STICK WITH FRANCE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO LET'S TALK GENERAL ECONOMICS
FOR A SECOND SINCE I TOTALLY
DEFEATED YOUR ANALYSIS.
ON BEHALF OF AMERICANS OUT
THERE, WHEN WILL THIS END?
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS OF
ECONOMIC CRISIS.
JOKE'S OVER.
WE GET IT.
WHEN WILL THE HAMMER THAT IS ON
AMERICANS' HEADS COME OFF?
>> WELL, IT STARTED IN 2007,
THIS RECESSION.
THAT'S THE WORST RECESSION SINCE
1929 AND OBVIOUSLY GOING TO TAKE
TIME TO GET OUT OF IT.
WE'VE HAD PRIVATE SECTOR JOB
GROWTH FOR NINE STRAIGHT MONTHS.
THE PRESIDENT'S THE FIRST ONE
OUT THERE SAYING THAT'S A GOOD
START BUT IT'S GOT TO BE MORE.
WE'VE GOT TO GET THE GROWTH RATE
HIGHER.
WE ARE GROWING, BUT IT'S A VERY
DEEP HOLE AND IT JUST TAKES A
WHILE TO GET OUT.
YOU KNOW, YOU LOVE THE CHILEAN
MINERS.
THEY PULL THEM UP ONE AT A TIME.
WE'RE GOING TO...
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING ALL
AT AMERICA IS AT THE BOTTOM OF A
MINE SHAFT RIGHT NOW?
>> IN JANUARY 2009, IT WAS AT
THE BOTTOM OF A VERY DEEP MINE
SHAFT.
>> Stephen: AND ARE WE STILL
DRILLING?
>> WE'RE COMING UP ONE AT A
TIME.
WE'RE PULLING IT UP.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD
BATTLE CRY.
>> WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS
PER MONTH WHEN THE PRESIDENT
CAME INTO OFFICE.
EPICALLY HORRIBLE.
ONE MONTH, THE MONTH OF JANUARY
2009 WAS ITSELF AS BIG AS THE
SPIRE RECESSION OF 2001 BY SOME
MEASURE.
AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WARREN
BUFFETT I KNOW A LITTLE BIT.
I MET HIM IN THE CAMPAIGN.
HE MAKES THE OBSERVATION THAT IN
1900 THE DOW WAS AT 50.
IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD FROM
1900 TO TODAY, WE HAD WORLD WAR
ONE.
WE HAD A DEPRESSION, WE HAD
WORLD WAR II, WE HAD VIETNAM, WE
HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS GO
WRONG.
AND YET BY 2010 THE DOW WAS AT
10000, 11,000, WE MAKE 10, 20
TIMES MORE THAN WE DID THEN.
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GROW
OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS STICK WITH
PLAN WHERE WE'RE MAKING
INVESTMENTS THAT WILL LEAD THE
ECONOMY TO GROW.
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING THAT AND
DOING POLICIES THAT WE KNOW
DON'T WORK, THAT DIDN'T WORK
WHEN WE DID THEM FIRST TIME AND
THAT WE'LL HAVE TO BORROW $700
BILLION TO ENACT.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE.
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT SPEECH.
WHAT I HEARD FROM IT IS TO GET
OUT OF THE HOLE WE NEED TO HAVE
TWO WORLD WARS AND A VIETNAM.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ECONOMICS.
CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC
