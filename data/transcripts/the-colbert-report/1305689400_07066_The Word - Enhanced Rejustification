""KUNG FU PANDA" IN THEATERS MAY
26th.
WE'VE BEEN WARNED.
THIS PANDACIDE PART TWO FOR SEAL
TEAM SIX.
TWO WEEKS AGO WE GOT BIN LADEN
AND WE ARE STILL REAPING THE
BENEFITS.
FOR ONE THING, WE FOUND HIS PORN
STASH, IT IS SOME ROUGH, ROUGH
STUFF.
WE'RE TALKING FULL FRONTAL
ANKLES.
OF COURSE, NOW WE CAN WARN
TEENAGE BOYS, IF THEY LOOK AT
PLAYBOY, NAVY SEAL WILL SHOOT
THEM IN THE EYE.
BEST OF ALL, FOLKS, THIS ACT OF
CLOSURE OPENS AN OLD WOUND.
>> THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN
RECINSDLED AN OLD DEBATE OVER
ENHANCED INTERROGATION, WHAT
SOME HAVE CALLED TORTURE.
>> THIS WEEK'S EVENTS HAVE
REIGNITED THIS HEATED DEBATE.
>> THAT NEWS ALSO REIGNITING THE
MEDIA DEBATE OVER WATERBOARDING.
>> Stephen: YES, THE DEBATE
OVER WATERBOARDING HAS BEEN
RECINGDLED AND REIGNITED, WHICH
BEGS THE QUESTION, DID WE TRY
FIRE BOARDING?
BUT FOLKS, THERE IS ONE WAY TO
END THIS TORTURE DEBATE, AND
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
"WORD."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ENHANCED REJUSTIFICATION.
NATION, THE TORTURE DEBATE
SEEMED OVER.
IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, OBAMA WAS AGAINST
WATERBOARDING AND McCAIN WAS
AGAINST ALL FORMS OF ENHANCED
INTERROGATION, BUT THEN, OF
COURSE, WE GOT BIN LADEN.
SOME CREDITED OBAMA.
SOME CREDITED BUSH, BUT THE REAL
HERO WAS AN ELITE TEAM MADE UP
OF A DISH RAG AND A WATER
BUCKET.
JIM.
>> IT WAS THE WATER BOARD OF THE
HARRY BACK GUY THAT PROVIDED THE
INTEL THAT LED TO HIS DOORSTEP.
>> SOME OF THE EARLY LEADS CAME
OUT OF THAT PROGRAM.
>> WITHOUT THE ENHANCED
INTERROGATION, WE NEVER WOULD
HAVE FOUND WHERE BIN LADEN WAS
HIDING.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS BECAUSE
OF WATERBOARDING THAT OSAMA BIN
LADEN IS DEAD.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
HIP, HIP HOORAY TO GEORGE BUSH.
>>
>> Stephen:, YES, THREE CHEERS
FOR GEORGE BUSH.
UNLESS YOU'RE IN A GAGGED
POSITION, IN WHICH CASE TRY
THREE GRUNTS.
FOLKS, IT WENT DOWN LIKE THIS...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE'S HOW THE WHOLE THING
PLAYED OUT.
WE WATER BOARDED KHALID SHEIKH
MOHAMMED, OBVIOUSLY AFTER THIS
PICTURE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE HE
CLEARLY HADN'T TOUCHED WATER FOR
SOME TIME.
NOW, AT SOME POINT, AT SOME
POINT KSM GAVE UP THE NICKNAME
OF ONE OF BIN LADEN'S COURIERS.
WE FOLLOWED THAT COURIER AND
THAT'S HOW WE NAILED BIN LADEN,
THEREFORE VALIDATING TORTURE.
BUT THE "I WANT TO BE ABLE TO
LOOK MY CHILDREN IN THE EYE"
CROWD REFUSED TO ADMIT TORTURE
IS THE REAL HERO HERE.
>> TORTURE IS NOT MORAL.
IT'S NOT LEGAL.
IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE.
>> IT WAS NOT TORTURE OR CRUEL,
INHUMAN, DEGRADING TREATMENT OF
DETAINEES THAT GOT US THE MAJOR
LEADS THAT ULTIMATELY ENABLED
OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO
FIND OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> ALL OF OUR EXPERIENCE SHOWS
YOU GENERATE BETTER, MORE
ACCURATE INFORMATION WHEN YOU
TREAT PRISONERS HUMANELY, WHEN
YOU BEFRIEND THEM, WHEN YOU
CONNECT WITH THEM.
>> PROBABLY THE MOST TORTURED
DETAINEE, KALIL SHEIKH MOHAMMED,
WATERED BOARDED 180 TIME, DID
NOT DIVLUGE THE NAME OF HIS
COURIER.
>> Stephen: HE DIDN'T GIVE THE
NAME DURING WATERBOARDING, BUT
HE WAS GAVE IT EVENTUALLY.
WE WERE JUST LOOSENING THE JAR
BY HOLDING IT UNDER WATER.
THE POINTED IS WE NEED A
DEFINITIVE STATEMENT THAT
WATERBOARDING LED US TO BIN
LADEN.
HOWING ABOUT THE GUY WHO ORDERED
IT.
RUMSFELD, HELP US OUT.
>> INFORMATION THAT CAME FROM
INTERROGATION IN GUANTANAMO LED
TO INFORMATION IN THIS.
BUT IT WAS NOT WATERBOARDING.
>> ANYONE THAT SUGGESTS THE
ENHANCED TECHNIQUES, LET'S BE
BLUNGT, WATERBOARDING, DID NOT
PRODUCE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
VALUABLE INTELLIGENCE, JUST
ISN'T FACING THE TRUTH.
>> Stephen: NOW, WHEN HE SAYS,
"LET'S BE BLUNT," IS HE
REFERRING TO WHAT HE WAS SMOKING
TO BE ABLE TO SAY BOTH OF THOSE
THINGS IN THE SAME WEEK?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS,
UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN RUMSFELD
DOESN'T SETTLE ANYTHING.
AND THE ONLY WAY TORTURE CAN BE
JUSTIFIED IS IF WE KNOW THAT
THEY SAVED LIVES.
BUT IF THERE IS NO INDISPUTABLE
EVIDENCE THAT TORTURE SAVES
LIVES, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING A
CIVILIZED NATION CAN DO?
TORTURE MORE.
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP TORTURING
UNTIL THERE IS ONE CLEAR CASE
WHERE EVERYONE SAYS THAT
TORTURING SAVES LIVES.
THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL OUR
ACTIONS BE JUSTIFIED.
SO WHO DO WE TORTURE NEXT?
NOW, WE COULD...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT COULD BE TERRORIST, BUT WHAT
ARE THEY GOING TO TELL US, WHERE
BIN LADEN IS?
THE ONLIES WHO KNOW THAT ARE
FISH, AND WATERBOARDING WON'T
HELP.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW WHAT KILLS MORE
AMERICANS THAN TERRORISTS?
DRUNK DRIVERS.
EVERY YEAR DRUNK DRIVERS KILL
37,000 PEOPLE.
THAT'S ALMOST 13 9/11S.
I SAY THAT JUSTIFIES COPS
ADMINISTERING SOMETHING A LITTLE
STRONGER THAN A BREATHALYZER.
AND IT'S NOT JUST...
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S NOT JUST THE DRIVERS.
PEDESTRIANS SHOULDN'T GET OFF
SCOT-FREE EITHER.
THE U.S. HAD OVER 4,000
PEDESTRIAN DEATHS LAST YEAR.
SO LET'S TORTURE JAYWALKERS.
AND, OF COURSE, OF COURSE, THE
NUMBER-ONE KILLER OF AMERICANS
IS HEART DISEASE, ONE DEATH
EVERY 34 SECONDS.
SO LET'S TORTURE OUR FAST FOOD
WORKERS.
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE EASY.
THE HOT OIL IS RIGHT THERE.
THE INTERROGATION IS NOT ONLY
ENHANCED, IT'S SUPERSIZED.
THE POINT IS WE KNOW THERE IS NO
GOING BACK.
WE HAVE ALREADY TORTURED PEOPLE.
YOU CANNOT UNRING THAT BELL.
AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE
ALREADY TORTURED PEOPLE COULD BE
THE DEATH OF AMERICA'S MORAL
LEADERSHIP.
TO SAVE THAT, WE MUST DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO JUSTIFY
WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE.
