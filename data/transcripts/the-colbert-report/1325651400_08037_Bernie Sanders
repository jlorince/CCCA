(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE JUNIOR
SENATOR FROM VERMONT.
WHO WILL BE THE FIRST GUEST I'VE
EVER LURED HERE WITH CHEDDAR.
PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR BERNIE
SANDERS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SENATOR SANDERS, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING BACK.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE AN
INDEPENDENT SENATOR FROM THE
GREAT STATE OF VERMONT.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE
SPEECH: AN HISTORIC FILIBUSTER
ON CORPORATE GREED AND THE
DECLINE OF OUR MIDDLE-CLASS."
THIS IS LITERALLY THE TEXT OF
WHAT YOU SAID IN AN EIGHT AND A
HALF HOUR FILIBUSTER.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: ON THE FLOOR OF
CONGRESS.
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO STOP
FROM HAPPENING WHEN YOU SHOT OFF
AT THE MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR A THIRD OF A DAY.
>> WHAT I WAS TRYING TO STOP WAS
A VERY BAD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS
WHICH EXTENDED THE BUSH TAX
BREAKS FOR THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
IN MY VIEW.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO CAUSES THE GRIDLOCK IN
CONGRESS.
>> NOT EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THEY WERE TRYING
TO DEAL DO A DEAL AND YOU SAID
"NO DEALS.
BERNIE SANDERS BELIEVES IN
STASIS."
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, BERNIE SANDERS BELIEVES
THAT THE MIDDLE-CLASS IS
COLLAPSING.
THAT WORKING FAMILIES NEED A
BREAK.
THAT THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE ARE
DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL AND THAT
IT'S TOTALLY APPROPRIATE THAT
THEY START PAYING THEIR FAIR
SHARE OF TAXES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
CHEERING ME AS A WEALTHY PERSON.
SURELY BY WEALTHY YOU MEAN JOB
CREATOR.
>> ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE
LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN THIS
COUNTRY THEY'VE BEEN OUTSOURCING
MILLIONS OF JOBS TO CHINA AND
OTHER COUNTRIES.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T SAY WHERE
THEY WERE CREATING THE JOBS,
SIR.
>> (LAUGHS).
>> Stephen: YOU WILL ADMIT
THEY ARE JOB CREATORS.
>> UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN AMERICA.
>> Stephen: ONE OF YOUR
BUGABOOS-- IF I CAN USE THAT
WORD ON A FAMILY SHOW-- IS THE
CITIZENS UNITED DECISION.
>> THE ABSURD CITIZENS UNITED
DECISION.
>> Stephen: IN THIS DECISION
IT SAID THAT BECAUSE
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE WHICH
HAS BEEN SETTLED LAW SINCE SANTA
CLARA V. SOUTHERN PACIFIC
RAILROAD IN 1886, BECAUSE THEY
ARE PERSONS THEY HAVE FREE
SPEECH AND SINCE MONEY EQUALS
SPEECH THEY CAN USE UNLIMITED
MONEY IN POLITICAL SPEECH.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH THAT?
>> Stephen: .
>> BETWEEN YOU AND ME, CORPSES
ARE NOT PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY ARE.
>> EXXONMOBIL, BANK OF AMERICA,
THEY ARE NOT THE KIND OF GUY YOU
SIT DOWN AND HAVE A BEER WITH.
THEY DON'T VOTE.
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
SPEND UNLIMITED HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY
ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS WITHOUT
DISCLOSURE.
THIS IS A AN ATTACK ON WHAT
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE
ABOUT.
>> YOU WANT CORPORATIONS TO RIDE
ON THE BACK OF THE BUS EVEN IF
IT'S A BUS COMPANY!
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO.
CORPORATIONS...
>> Stephen: YOU ARE CURTAILING
THE SPEECH.
>> THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE SPEECH
THEY WANT BUT THEY CAN NOT BE
ALLOWED TO BUY ELECTIONS AND
THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT CITIZENS
UNITED IS ABOUT.
>> Stephen: I WORK FOR VIACOM.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A BIG
CORPORATION.
I GET TO HAVE POLITICAL SPEECH
ON MY SHOW.
>> YOU ARE A PERSON, VIACOM IS
NOT A PERSON.
>> Stephen: BUT VIACOM PAYS ME
TO SAY THESE THINGS!
>> (LAUGHS).
>> Stephen: IF VIACOM PAYS ME
TO SAY SOMETHING I WILL SAY IT
ON MY SHOW, OKAY?
WHAT IS TO KEEP... WHY CAN'T
VIACOM DO THAT AS A HUGE
CORPORATION BUT MONSANTO CAN'T?
>> BECAUSE CORPORATIONS ARE
INSTRUMENTS OF GOVERNMENT.
GOVERNMENT IS CONTROLLED BY THE
PEOPLE.
THE PEOPLE ELECT THEIR
GOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen: SO THE GOVERNMENT
CAN TELL VIACOM THEY CAN NOT
BROADCAST EDITORIALS?
>> NO...
>> Stephen: YOUR LITTLE BILL
SAID CORPORATIONS COULD NOT USE
UNLIMITED MONEY FOR SPEECH.
CORPORATIONS LIKE VIACOM THAT
ARE NEWS CORPORATIONS COULD NOT
HAVE POLITICAL SPEECH.
CHECK AND MATE, SIR.
WOW.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
WHAT I THINK THAT IF AMERICAN
DEMOCRACY HAS S GOING TO SURVIVE
THEY CAN NOT HAVE A HANDFUL OF
LARGE ENTITIES SPENDING HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ELECTING
THE CANDIDATES WHO WILL
REPRESENT THEIR INTEREST.
WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT WHICH MAKES IT VERY
CLEAR.
CORPSES ARE NOT PEOPLE, THEY DO
NOT HAVE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
IN TERMS OF BUYING ELECTIONS
AND, IN FACT, LEGISLATURES AND
THE CONGRESS DO HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REGULATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE.
>> Stephen: YOU INTRODUCED
SUCH AN AMENDMENT ON DECEMBER 8
CALLED THE SAVING AMERICAN
DEMOCRACY ACT OR THE SAD ACT.
(LAUGHTER)
CITIZENS UNITED IS A VERY, VERY
SAD DECISION.
ONE OF THE WORST SUPREME COURT
DECISIONS EVER MADE.
>> Stephen: IF SOMEONE WANTS
TO SUPPORT YOUR CALL FOR A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AGAINST
CITIZENS UNITED IS THERE A PLACE
THEY CAN GO.
>> WE HAVE A WEB SITE, WE HAVE
120,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY
SIGNED THE PETITION.
WE WOULD LIKE MORE ON THE THE
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THIS
DISASTROUS DECISION.
THERE'S GOING TO BE
DEMONSTRATIONS ALL ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: IT HAS TO BE
PASSED THROUGH BOTH HOUSES OF
CONGRESS AND THEN RATIFIED BY
TWO-THIRDS OF THE STATES?
SO BY MAY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: SENATOR SANDERS,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
SENATOR BERNARD SANDERS, THE
BOOK IS "THE SPEECH."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
