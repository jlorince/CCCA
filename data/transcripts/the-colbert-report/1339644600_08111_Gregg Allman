( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST IS A LEGENDARY ROCKER AND FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND.
IF YOU HOLD UP YOUR LIGHTER AT THE END OF THE BOOK, MAYBE HE'LL COME BACK OUT AND WROTE AN APPENDIX.
PLEASE WELCOME, GREG ALLMAN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. ALLMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
HAVE A SEAT, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOTTA EYE DON'T KNOW EVEN HOW TO APPROACH THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU.
BECAUSE YOU ARE A LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE.
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH BEING REFERRED TO AS A LEGEND?
>> WELL... UH...
( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S SOME THAT I REALLY DON'T LIKE.
THAT'S NOT ONE --
>> Stephen:  YOU DON'T LIKE-- YOU DON'T LIKE THE-- YOU DON'T
LIKE SOME OF YOUR LEGENDS OR YOU DON'T LIKE!  THINGS THAT ARE SAID ABOUT YOU?
>> NO, I DON'T EYE DON'T MIND BEING REFERRED TO AS A LEGEND ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S A HARD ONE TO LIVE UP TO,
YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen:  ABSOLUTELY,
ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME OF YOUR LEGENDS ARE PRETTY HARD LIVING.
>> IT'S THINGS LIKE "SUPERSTAR,
ROCK STAR."
>> Stephen:  CIVIL WAR REENACTOR ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU CUT YOUR HAIR, MISTER.
YOU CUT YOUR HAIR, MISTER, AND YOU COULD PLAY ROBERT E. LEE.
NOW, YOU ARE A SON OF THE SOUTH.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, OKAY.
YOU ALSO 21 A MILITARY ACADEMY GROWING UP.
OKAY.
>> FOUR YEARS.
>> Stephen:  FOUR YEARS IN THE MILITARY ACADEMY.
HOW DID YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO IN SCHOOL?
>> I HAD ABOUT A-- I HAD ABOUT A 3.8 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  NOT BAD.
NOW, YOU AND YOUR BROTHER,
DWAYNE, BOTH WENT THERE.
DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE A MILITARY LIFE?
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE DOING?
I HAVE SEEN PICTURES OF YOU IN THIS BOOK-- BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE A NEW BIOGRAPHY, AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
"GREG ALLMAN:  MY CROSS TO BEAR." THIS THING IS GETTING GREAT REVIEWS.
THE PHOTOS IN HERE OF YOU AS THAT HIGH SCHOOL MILITARY STUDENT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A GUY
WHO IS GOING TO BECOME THIS,
OKAY.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU MIGHT BE IN THE YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
>> NO, WHEN I GOT TO MY SENIOR YEAR, I PICKED UP THIS NEWSPAPER AND SAID VIETNAM.
>> Stephen:  WAIT A SECOND.
THE WHOLE TIME IN MILITARY SCHOOL, YOU THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE UNIFORM?
THE WHOLE SHOOTING PEOPLE DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU?
>> I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE WHEN I STARTED.
>> Stephen:  OH, OKAY, OKAY.
>> I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GREAT THAT WE, UNLIKE THE FOOLS AT HOME, THEY'RE SITTING THERE
GLOVING THEIR LITTLE PLASTIC MODELS TOGETHER, WHEREAS WE ARE TAKING 52, LABELING EACH PIECE,
AND PUTTING BACK TOGETHER 30,
50, AND 70 MILLION METER MACHINE GUNS.
SO WE GOT OUR GRADE.
>> Stephen:  YOU HAD A 3.8 IN MACHINE GUNS.
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT BEFORE.
>> THEY LOVED THAT, THOUGH.
>> Stephen:  I BET THEY DID.
>> I THOUGHT THIS AIN'T PART OF MY SCRIPT.
AND I GOT-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  OKAY, NOW THIS STORY DIRECTLY LEADS ME TO KIND OF A LITTLE TICKLISH PART OF
THIS INTERVIEW.
I HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS BOOK IS PACKED WITH THE MOST FANTASTIC STORIES,
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE KNOW-- SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
YOURS HAS BEEN INTERESTING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE LIVED SOME CRAZY ROCK 'N' ROLL ( BLEEP ).
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE.
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU WOULD PREFER NOT TO DISCUSS ANY OF THE STORIES IN THIS BOOK.
IS THAT TRUE?
>> WOMAN, THEY'RE IN THE BOOK.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  BUT, YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE TEASE THE
PEOPLE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE BOOK.
LIKE, YOU WERE MARRIED TO CHER,
CORRECT?
>> SHE WAS MARRIED TO ME ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  YOU SEE?
THAT'S IN THE BOOK!
THAT'S IN THE BOOK!
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT WOMEN IN DIFFERENT HOTEL ROOMS AFTER A SHOW.
>> NO COMMENT.
>> Stephen:  NO COMMENT?
NO, COME OCOMMENT.
LET'S MOVE SOME PAPER, MAN ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WHEN YOUR BAND WENT ON YOUR PLANE FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOUR 720, IT WAS WRITTEN OUT ON THE
BAR IN COCAINE,"WELCOME, ALLMAN BROTHERS." THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STORIES IN THIS BOOK.
>> THE BRACKETS WAS A BRIEFATED ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  OH!
SO YOU GUYS-- YOU GUYS WEREN'T-- YOU WEREN'T TOILETLY OUT OF CONTROL.
IT WAS WITHIN MODERATION.
>> SUPERVISED AT ALL TIMES.
>> Stephen:  AT ALL TIMES,
ABSOLUTELY.
WELL, LISTEN, IT'S BEEN GREAT TO MEET YOU.
IT'S BEEN GREAT TO HAVE YOU OUT HERE.
GOSH, I WISH WE COULD ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THINGS IN THIS BOOK BECAUSE I RARELY HAVE ANY
INTEREST IN MY GUEST'S BOOK-- DON'T SALE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME ON--
>> I DON'T WON'T.
>> Stephen:  BUT THIS BOOK AND YOUR MUC HAS IN ANY EVENT A LOT TO ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING
