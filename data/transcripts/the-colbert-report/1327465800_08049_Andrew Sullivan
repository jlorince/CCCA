[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A POLITICAL
COLUMNIST FOR THE DAILY BEAST.
HE IS ABOUT TO SIT DOWN WITH THE
NIGHTLY BEAUTY.
PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW SULLIVAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HAY, ANDREW, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
BACK.
>> YOU'RE SO WELCOME.
>> STEPHEN: THOUGH YOU ARE A
LONGTIME FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
SEVEN TIMES BACK.
YOU GET A FOOT LONG SUB NOW.
I HAVE TO TAKE TO YOU TASK.
YOU WROTE THE COVER ARTICLE IN
THE JANUARY 23 NEWSWEEK.
IT SAYS WHY ARE OBAMA'S CRITICS
SO DUMB?
ARE YOU ALWAYS THAT GOOD AT IS A
DEUCING -- SEDUCING THE
OPPOSITION OF AGREEING WITH YOU?
WHY NOT JUST CALL THEM UGLY,
TOO.
I'M IN OPPOSITION.
REASONABLE RAE REPUBLICANS ARE
IN OPPOSITION TO BARACK OBAMA.
WHY ARE WE DUMB, SMARTY.
>> I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE DUMB.
>> STEPHEN: ANDREW SULLIVAN
DON'T BLAME ANYBODY ELSE.
>> I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.
LISTENING TO THE REPUBLICAN
DEBATES ALL THE REASONABLE
REPUBLICANS ARGUING AND DID HE
BAITING RATIONALLY WITH ONE
OTHER AND WITH SUBSTANCE, I
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE PICTURE
THEY WERE PAINTING OF THIS
PRESIDENT EITHER DOMESTICALLY OR
IN FOREIGN POLICY.
>> STEPHEN: HE IS A COMPLETE
NAIL YOUR.
HE HAS FISH -- FAILURE.
HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING.
THEY HAVE A VEGETABLE GARDEN AND
THAT IS IT.
WHAT HE HAS DONE?
>> THE ISSUE WAS THE WARS.
HE PROMISED TO THE END THE WAR
IN IRAQ AND WIN IT IN
AFGHANISTAN.
HE HAS DONE BOTH.
THAT'S I BIG DEAL.
>> STEPHEN: EXCUSE ME, I KNOW
YOU WANT TO APPLAUD FOR ME BUT
IS THE AFGHAN WAR OVER, SIR?
>> WHAT WE CAN SAY IS 200 OF TOP
AL QAEDA LEADERS WHICH BUSH
MANAGED TO LEAVE THERE HAVE BEEN
WIPED OUT, TAKEN OUT BY DRONES
AND THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN IN THE
MOST BAD-ASS MOVE IMAGINABLE WAS
KILLED AND ALL THE INTELLIGENCE
OF HIS COMPOUND CAPTURES BECAUSE
THIS MAN DECIDED TO DO WHAT BUSH
DIDN'T DO IN EIGHT YEARS.
>> STEPHEN: I'M SORRY DID
OBAMA -- DID OBAMA --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DID OBAMA PERSONALLY PARACHUTE
INTO THE COMPOUND?
THAT WAS THE NAVY SEALS, SIR.
>> BUSH SAID DURING HIS TERM I
DON'T CARE ABOUT BIN LADEN HE IS
NO LONGER AN ISSUE FOR ME.
OBAMA DID.
HE COMES IN AND SAYS TO THE
C.I.A. THIS IS A PRIORITY AGAIN
UNLIKE UNDER BUSH AND HE
PERSONALLY APPROVED A SPECIFIC
PLAN INCLUDING THE EXTRA
HELICOPTERS TO GO IN.
IT'S BAD-ASS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
WHAT HAS HE DONE FOR ME LATELY
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY?
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR
JOBS.
>> YOU WOULD CONCEDE THAT HE
DIDN'T CREATE THIS RECESSION.
>> STEPHEN: NOR DID HE CREATE
ONE JOB.
HE HAS NOT CREATED ONE JOB, SIR.
>> IT'S NOT TRUE, I'M AFRAID.
>> STEPHEN: IT IS BECAUSE I
WILL REPEAT IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: HE DID NOT CREATE
ONE JOB.
>> THE WORST MONTH IN THIS
RECESSION WAS DECEMBER 2008.
>> STEPHEN: WHEN HE TOOK
OFFICE 7.8% OF AMERICANS ARE OUT
OF WORK.
IT'S STILL ABOVE 8:5% SIR.
CHECK MATE.
>> AND NOT BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE
WE WERE LOSING 750,000 JOBS A
MONTH.
>> STEPHEN: OF COURSE,
EVERYBODY WAS JUMPING SHIP
BECAUSE THEY KNEW HE WAS COMING
IN.
PEOPLE WERE PANICKING.
THEY KNEW WE WOULD HAVE A
SOCIALIST PRESIDENT.
>> EVERY SINGLE MONTH SINCE WE
WENT INTO JOB GROWTH.
WE'VE HAD JOB GROWTH EVER SINCE.
DESPITE THE FACT THAT TERRIBLE
CRISES FROM EUROPE AND OTHER
STRESSES.
IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL.
PEOPLE ARE WORKING.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING BACK TO WORK.
EVEN ROMNEY SAID YESTERDAY, THE
OTHER DAY, THAT THINGS ARE GET
BEGUN BETTER.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S WHY ROMNEY
IS GOING DOWN IN THE POLLS
BECAUSE HE SAID THINGS ARE
GETTING BETTER.
>> LAURA INGRAHAM SAID IT'S IN
THE A GOOD ARGUMENT BUT IT
HAPPENS TO BET TRUTH.
IT IS THE TRUTH.
>> STEPHEN: WHO CARES WHAT IS
TRUE?
OKAY.
LET'S GO WITH WHAT FEELS RIGHT.
IT FEELS LIKE HE HASN'T DONE
ANYTHING.
I DON'T HEAR A LOT OF TALK.
EVEN THE LEFT DOESN'T AGREE WITH
YOU.
THEY ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT.
>> THEY ARE AS DA DELUDED FROM
THE RIGHT.
HE NEVER RAVES A LIBERAL.
HE RAN AS A REFORMIST.
THAT'S WHAT HE HAS DONE.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS GREAT
DEPRESSION HAS PASSED UNIVERSAL
HEALTH CARE SOMETHING THAT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
OKAY.
LOOK, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
KNOW.
YOU ARE ENGLISH, RIGHT?
ARE YOU AMERICAN AN CITIZEN?
>> I HAVE A GREEN CARD FOUR
YEARS AND I'LL BE ONE.
>> STEPHEN: CAN YOU VOTE IN
THIS ELECTION.
>> NO, JUST A GREEN CARD.
>> Stephen: I'M BEING NICE TO
YOU TO LET YOU EVEN TALK ABOUT
OUR POLITICS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I KNOW.
>> STEPHEN: YOU GET TO VOTE
FOR WHOEVER IS QUEEN NEXT TIME.
IN ENGLAND YOU HAVE THE
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE OVER
THERE.
NOBODY GETS IT.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SYSTEM IS?
>> STEPHEN: YOU STAND IN LINE
FOR SIX MONTHS AND IN THE END
YOU GOT A KIDNEY PIE.
>> IN BRITAIN THE GOVERNMENT
OWNS EVERY HOSPITAL, PLOYS EVERY
DOCTOR, RUNS THE SYSTEM.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANT.
>> OBAMA GAVE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
TO GIVE THE PRIVATE COMPANIES
AND PROVIDE A SUBSIDY FOR THE
POOR TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT.
THAT WAS A POLICY THAT CAME FROM
THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION A RIGHT
WING THINK TANK.
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COMES
FROM THE RIGHT.
HE DID A MODERATE, PRAGMATIC
HEALTH CARE REFORM FAR MORE
CONSERVATIVE THAN NIXON PROPOSED
IN 1974 AND WAY TO THE RIGHT OF
HILLARY CLINTON IN 1993.
>> STEPHEN: THOUGH EVERYTHING
YOU JUST SAID SOUNDS REASONABLE
SO WE'LL EDIT THAT OUT IN THE
END.
ANDREW SULLIVAN THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> YOU BET.
>> STEPHEN: ANDREW SULLIVAN
