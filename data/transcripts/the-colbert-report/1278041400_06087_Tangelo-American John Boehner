NATION, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY
TRYING WEEK FOR A TRUE AMERICAN
HERO.
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER JOHN
BOEHNER, YESTERDAY BARACK OBAMA
ACCUSED BOEHNER OF BEING OUT OF
TOUCH WITH THE STRUGGLES OF
AMERICANS FAMILIES JUST BECAUSE
BOEHNER MADE THIS INNOCENT
OBSERVATION ABOUT THE DEMOCRAT'S
NEW FINANCIAL REFORM BILL.
>> THIS IS KILLING ANTS WITH A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
>>
>> Stephen: REPUBLICANS PREFER
TO KILL ANTS WITH MAGNIFYING
GLASSES, OR AS THEY CALL IT,
"SUN BOARDING."
[LAUGHTER]
AND THERE IS A GOOD REASON NOT
TO NUKE ANTS.
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST
TIME WE TRIED IT?
WELCOME TO OBAMA'S AMERICA.
GET USED TO PICNICKING IN BODY
ARMOUR.
THEN TODAY, FOLKS, THERE WAS
ANOTHER SENSELESS PERSONAL
ATTACK ON BOEHNER.
>> THE SO-CALLED TANNING TAX,
ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE NEW
FEDERAL HEALTH CARE LAW GOES
INTO EFFECT TODAY.
>> Stephen: A TANNING TAX.
BOO!
NO TAXATION WITHOUT RADIATION.
AND CLEARLY JOHN BOEHNER IS
GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY HARD
HIT BECAUSE I BELIEVE HIS
TANNING BED IS ALSO HIS BED.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE NOT SEEN LEGISLATION SO
SPECIFICALLY TARGETING ONE
REPUBLICAN SINCE THEY PASSED A
TAX ON TURTLE WAX.
[LAUGHTER]
AND BOEHNER -- TRUE.
IT'S A TRUE STORY.
AND BOEHNER HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT
OF VICIOUS HATE SPEECH FROM ONE
MR. JOE SCARBOROUGH.
>> I HEAR IT ON THE HILL.
I'M SURE YOU HEAR IT ON THE HILL
ALL THE TIME.
IT'S NOT REPORTED.
BUT SO MANY REPUBLICANS TELL ME
THIS IS A GUY THAT IS NOT THE
HARDEST WORKER IN THE WORLD.
EVERY REPUBLICANS I TALK TO SAYS
THAT JOHN BOEHNER BY 5:00 OR
6:00 AT NIGHT, YOU CAN SEE HIM
AT BARS.
HE IS NOT A HARD WORKER.
>> WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT
THE KNOCK I HEAR MOST
FREQUENTLY.
>> DO YOU HEAR THE KNOCK?
>> I DEFINITELY HEAR PEOPLE FEEL
THAT HE'S NOT COMMITTED TO THE
PARTY.
>> THAT HE'S LAZY.
>> Stephen: OH, SURE, JOE,
BOEHNER'S LAZY JUST BECAUSE HIS
SKIN IS DARKER THAN YOURS.
YOU ARE CLEARLY RACIST AGAINST
TANGELO AMERICANS.
OH, WE'VE ALL HEARD IT.
ORANGE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO
WORK.
ORANGE PEOPLE JUST DRINK ALL
DAY.
OH, ORANGE PEOPLE HATE MONDAYS
AND LOVE LASAGNA.
OH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ORANGE PEOPLE JUST SIT AROUND ON
THE FRONT STEPS ALL DAY WITH
CANDLES IN THEIR MOUTHS, AND IF
YOU'RE BAD, ORANGE PEOPLE ROLL
YOU AWAY TO THE JUICING ROOM.
NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING ORANGE
PEOPLE ARE PERFECT, THIS GUY IS
CLEARLY A TWEAKER.
BUT THERE'S A LIMIT.
SO REPRESENTATIVE BOEHNER, LET
ME APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF ALL
PUNDITS.
I HOPE THAT NEXT WEEK IS
