>> Stephen: IT'S ONLY 272WORDS.
IF IT WAS GOOD, I'M GOING TOKEEP TALKING IF IT WAS GOOD,
WOULDN'T THERE BE MORE OFIT?
>> NO, THAT'S THE BEAUTY.
PURE PRESIDENTIAL POETRY,HE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
BECAUSE THOMAS JEFFERSONSAID ALL MEN ARE CREATED
EQUAL BUT HE OWNED OTHERHUMAN BEINGS.
LINCOLN FREED THOSE HUMANBEINGS AND SET IN MOTION A
KIND OF 2.0 VERSION WHICHTHE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS IS WE
HAVEN'T REPLACED IT.
AND IN 272 WORDS, IN 10SENTENCE, THE FIRST ONE FOUR
SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS ISWHERE WE'VE BEEN, NOW WE ARE
ENGAGED IN A GREAT CIVIL WARIS WHERE WE ARE, AND THE
REST ARE ABOUT PULLING USINTO A FUTURE THAT WE HAVE
BECOME.
HE ASKED US TO BE ADIFFERENT KIND OF PEOPLE TO
HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM.
AND THIS FILM IS ABOUT ASMALL SCHOOL IN VERMONT
WHERE THE KIDS SUFFER FROMDISLEXIA, ADHD, A WHOLE
HOST OF LEARNING DIFFERENCESTHAT MAKES THEIR PASSAGE
THROUGH SCHOOL VERYCHALLENGING.
BUT EACH YEAR THE SCHOOL FORTHE 35 YEARS IT HAS BEEN IN
EXISTENCE HAS CHALLENGED THEKIDS TO FIRST MEMORIZE IT
AND THEN PUBLICLY RECITE THEGETTYSBURG ADDRESS.
>> Stephen: AND THEY COMPETEAGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE
ONE WHO GETS TO DO THIS.
>> NO, NO, THEY ALL DO ITTHEY ALL MEMORIZE IT, AND
THEY HAVE ALL-- .
>> Stephen: BUT DOESSOMEBODY WIN, ISN'T THERE A
WINNER, IS THERE A WINNER?
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKEYOU'RE HAVING CHILD FIGHTS
AGAINST EACH OTHER.
JUST 50 CHILDREN.
>> EXACTLY, NO, NO, THERE ISA MIDDLE SCHOOL AND A HIGH
SCHOOL, FIRST, SECOND ANDTHIRD.
BUT THEY'RE ALL WINNERSBECAUSE THEY OVERCOME THIS,
LOOK, WE DON'T DO ANY MEMORIZATION IN SCHOOL ANY
MORE.
WE USED TO MEMORIZE A LOTOF STUFF.
>> I DIDN'T DO IT BEFORE.
>> WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIPOF THE FILM.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> WE HAVE DIVIDED THEGETTYSBURG INTO FIVE
PARAGRAPHS FOR LEARNING.
>> FOUR SCORE AND SEVENYEARS AGO OUR FATHERS-- BROUGHT
FORTH ON THIS CONTINENT ANEW NATION WITH LIBERTY AND
DEDICATED TO THE -- THAT ALLMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.
>> YOU DID THAT VERY WELL.
CAN YOU TELL THEM WHAT WASGOING ON IN PARAGRAPH 1,
ABOUT FOUR SCORE.
>> HOW AMERICA CAME TOGETHER, AND THEN WHAT'S HAPPENING.
>> OUR FATHERS BROUGHT FORTH>> ON THIS CONTINENT A NEW
NATION DEDICATED>> TO THE PROPOSITION THAT
>> ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.
>> Stephen: IF LINCOLN HADLOST THE WAR WOULD WE BE
MEMORIZING THIS SPEECH?
>> THAT'S SO INTERESTING.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, IASKED IT?
(LAUGHTER)>> SELBY FOOT IN THE CIVIL
WAR SAID AS A MISSISSIPPIANTHAT EVEN THOUGH HE, HIS
PEOPLE HAD LOST THE CIVILWAR, HE WAS ASKED TO MEMORIZE
IT BECAUSE IT WAS SUCHAN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF
DICTION SUCH ANEXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF
RHETORIC THAT IT SORT OFWOULD BE REMEMBERED
REGARDLESS.

>> Stephen: BUT WHY THISADDRESS?
I MEAN THERE ARE SOME GREATPRESIDENTIAL SPEECHES OUT
THERE.
WHY NOT WILLIAM HENRYHARRISON'S 8400-WORD
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURALADDRESS THAT WAS SO POWERFUL
THAT IT KILLED HIM.
>> THAT HE DIED!
>> Stephen: ONE MONTH LATER.
