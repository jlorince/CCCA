>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
WE CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION WITH GOVERNOR, AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN.
GOVERNOR HUNTSMAN, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
THE ROM MY CAMPAIGN HAS SAID THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE FAKING THEIR ORDERS FROM FACT CHECKERS.
HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK THE FACTS ARE?  TO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ..
>>
>> Stephen: GO AHEAD.
>> I WOULD SAY WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT, STEPHEN ABOUT THE FISCAL DEFICIT.
I WOULD SAY, I WOULD SAY THAT JUST AS CORROSIVE IN THIS COUNTRY IS CALLED THE TRUST DEFICIT.
WHY DO WE HAVE A TRUST DEFICIT IN THIS COUNTRY?
>> Stephen: BECAUSE OF --
>> I AM LOOKING AT YOUR HIGHLY DIVERSE CROWD.
>> WE HAVE A TRUST DEFICIT IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE WITH NOT GETTING THE STRAIGHT SCOOP
FROM OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, AND BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THAT PEOPLE DON'T TRUST ELECTED OFFICIALS
AND DON'T TRUST THE INSTITUTIONS OF POWER, I AM HERE TO TELL YOU
MILLIONS THIS COUNTRY TAKES STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THE TRUST DEFER SIT LIKE TERM LIMITS FOR
OFFICIALS AND DEALING WITH CAMPAIGN FINANCE, DEALING WITH A REVOLVING DOOR THAT JUST ALLOWS
PEOPLE TO LEAVE AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR A WHILE AND THEY BECOME LOBBYISTS AND
CREATED THIS ESTABLISHMENT IN DC THAT BASICALLY JUST BREEDS THE FOUR-YEAR CAMPAIGN, SO WE ARE
GOING TO END IN NOVEMBER AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO START 2016 ALL OVER AGAIN.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE FUTURE YOU HOPE FOR FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?  WHAT ARE THE TWO
DIFFERENT OUT COMES, ROMNEY WINS, DOESN'T WIN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOUR PARTY AND ALL
THE PEOPLE DOWN IN TAMPA?
>> WELL FOR ME PERSONALLY THE FACT I AM HERE WITH YOU HAVING THIS CONVERSATION PROBABLY MEANS
--
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PARTY IF ROMNEY LOSES.
>> THE PARTY THEN GOES INTO THE WILDERNESS FOR A WHILE.
>> Stephen: LIKE WHERE?
>> AND TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY STAND FOR GOING FORWARD, AND
EVENTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO LEAD UP TO THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DRAWS FROM A
LOT OF DIFFERENT CHAPTERS IN HISTORY WILL THERE IS A LOT THAT CAN INSPIRE THE PARTY GOING
FORWARD, SO ABRAHAM LINCOLN BELIEVING IN INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY,
THEODORE ROOSEVELT, BELIEVING THE LAND IS AN IMPORTANT LEGACY WE ARE LEAVING BEHIND,
EISENHOWER WHO LEFT US WITH THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM, WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN
THIS COMPANY COUNTRY?  YOU CAN'T COMPETE.
>> Stephen: GOVERNMENT DOES THAT.
>> WELL, OF COURSE.
THERE IS A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen: LOOKING BACK,
LOOKING BACK, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAD TO HAVE DONE TO BE THE BUY GIVEN THAT SPEECH TONIGHT?
>> YOU KNOW, I MADE YOU AN OFFER, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: YOU DID.
>> WE STATISTIC AT THIS TABLE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I ASKED IF YOU WOULD BE MY RUNNING MATE.
>> Stephen: YOU ASKED ME TO BE YOUR RUNNING MATE IN MANDARIN.
>> YES.
WE HAVE TO GO BUT WOULD YOU DO ONE THING FOR ME?  WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME YOUR HONEST
OPINION OF MITT ROMNEY IN MANDARIN?  AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NOBODY SPEAKS IT.
>>
>> Stephen: THAT SHOULD BE ON A BUMPER STICKER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!  GOVERNOR JON HUNTSMAN.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
