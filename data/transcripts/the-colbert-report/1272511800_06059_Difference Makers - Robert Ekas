>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU CAN'T YELL "FIRE" IN A CROWDED
THEATER, UNLESS IT'S ACTUALLY ON FIRE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT MEANS IF I WANT FREE SPEECH, I HAVE TO BECOME AN ARSONIST.
SAD.
WELL, TONIGHT I PROFILE MAN WHO IS BRAVELY EXERCISING HIS RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH, AND I AM HONORED
TO CALL HIM A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
OUR COUNTRY IS HELD TOGETHER BY THE RIGHTS GRANTS IN THE CONSTITUTION.
FIRST AND FOREMOST OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH, A FREEDOM THAT COULD BE LOST IF IT WASN'T FOR THE
TIRELESS WORK OF HEROES LIKE ROBERT.
>> IF WE DON'T EXERCISE THE RIGHTS THAT ARE GRANTED BY THE
CONSTITUTION, WE ARE IN A VERY REAL DANGER OF LOSING THEM.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS WHY ROBERT EXERCISES THE FIRST AMENDMENT EVERY CHANCE HE GETS.
>> ALMOST EVERY TIME I SEE A POLICE OFFICER, I EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THE INSTITUTION THUSLY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE HE BRAVELY USES THE CONSTITUTION TO PRESERVE OUR INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO
BE AN [BLEEP], TONIGHT WE SALUTE ROBERT, DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ROBERT HAS A SIMPLE, PRECISE EXPLANATION FOR HIS ACTIONS.
>> THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY IT IS THAT I GIVE THE POLICE
OFFICER, ANY PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER THE FINGER.
REASON NUMBER ONE, IN ANY BIG ORGANIZATION THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME BAD APPLES, TO USE THE
APPLE ANALOGY, IN A BUNCH.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
A COUPLE DAYS AGO -- WAS IT TUESDAY, MAYBE WEDNESDAY, YEAH,
IT WAS WEDNESDAY -- THIS GOES BACK TO WHEN I WAS A CHILD IN CALIFORNIA.
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT,
IRONICALLY ENOUGH, I'LL GET TO THE IRONY HERE IN A SECOND.
THE NAIL JOY I SUBSCRIBE TO GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE APPLES.
>> Stephen: BOTTOM LINE, HE DOES IT BECAUSE HE HAS THE RIGHT TO.
>> THE MIDDLE FINGER SERVES A NECESSARY FUNCTION TO ENSURE THE FREEDOM OF OUR SOCIETY.
>> Stephen: DON'T BELIEVE ROBERT?
WE DIDN'T EITHER, SO WE CONSULTED AN ACTUAL LEGAL EXPERT ON FLIPPING THE BIRD.
PROFESSOR ROBINS OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.
>> IF SOMEBODY IS MILDLY ANGRY,
THEY MIGHT JUST GIVE THE MIDDLE FINGER.
IF THEY ARE VERY ANGRY, THEY HIGH GIVE IT WITH SOME WORDS OR FACIAL EXPRESSION THAT SHOWS ANGER.
IF THEY'RE OFF-THE-CHARTS ANGRY,
THEY MAY GIVE A DOUBLE.
>> Stephen: TOLD YOU HE WAS AN EXPERT.
PROFESSOR ROBINS BELIEVES THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMENDMENT.
>> I WOULD NOT SAY THE FIRST
AMENDMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMENDMENT.
IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES.
>> Stephen: WELL, CAN YOU JUST SAY IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT?
>> IF YOU WANT.
>> Stephen: YES, I WANT.
>> OKAY, SURE.
>> Stephen: JUST SAY IT.
>> THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMENDMENT IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO BE A
[BLEEP].
YOUR PEERS MIGHT THINK YOU'RE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DICK HEAD.
BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO ACT.
>> Stephen: AND THEY WOULD BE RIGHT.
>> YOU CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THE STUPIDITY OF SOME PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: MEET A POLICE OFFICER.
>> IF YOU FLIP OFF A POLICE OFFICER, YOU'LL GOING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: AND DRAW ATTENTION HE HAS.
>> I WAS DRIVING DOWN... IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED A HIGHWAY.
IT'S MORE OF AN AVENUE, IF YOU WILL.
>> Stephen: [BLEEP] IT.
ITSELF LET'S CALL IT A STREET.
>> I ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW AND GAVE THE GUY THE FINGER.
>> Stephen: BUT HIS BRAVERY DIDN'T END THERE.
>> AND HE CAME UP BEHIND ME.
AS HE DID, SO I STUCK MY HAND OUT AND GAVE HIM THE FINGER AGAIN.
>> Stephen: ROBERT HAS BEEN PULLED OVER MULTIPLE TIMES FOR NO CRIME OTHER THAN D.W.A.,
DRIVING WHILE AN [BLEEP].
>> ROBERT HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO GIVE THE FINGER TO WHOMEVER
HE WANTS, EVEN IF THE RECIPIENT HAPPENS TO BE A POLICE OFFICER.
>> Stephen: SO NOW ROBERT IS SUING THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
FOR VIOLATING HIS RIGHT TO GIVE THE FINGER.
>> ROBERT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
WITHOUT ROBERT, ALL OF OUR RIGHTS TO USE THE MIDDLE FINGER WOULD BE LOST.
>> Stephen: THIS MOST BE THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST OF OUR INALIENABLE RIGHT TO PISS
SOMEONE OFF SINCE 1776.
>> THERE IS A QUOTE OUTSIDE THE U.S. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE BY THOMAS JEFFERSON THAT MIRRORS
THAT OPINION.
I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT QUOTE, BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT A WAY TO DEFEND, YOU KNOW...
UH... WOW, I CAN CALL MY SON REAL QUICK AND ASK HIM.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
ROBERT IS CARRYING ON THE PROUD TRADITION OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS.
>> IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING, THE FOUNDING FATHERS DID, IN FACT,
GIVE KING GEORGE THE FINGER.
NO, KING GEORGE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THAT TASK, NO WE'RE
NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THAT RULE,
NEW YORK WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AN INDEPENDENT NATION.
NO.
>> Stephen: A TRADITION CARRIED ON BY GREAT AMERICANS TODAY.
ROBERT WONDERS WHAT HIS LEGACY WILL BE.
>> I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS WHO I AM.
I'M NOT MARTIN LUTHER KING.
I'M NOT MOTHER TERESA.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT.
>> I CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR ANYBODY ELSE BUT MYSELF.
ALL I CAN DO IS EXPRESS AN IDEA.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS WHY HE'S CALLING ON DIFFERENCE-MAKERS EVERYWHERE TO RAISE THEIR FINGERS.
>> IF THERE WAS A MILLION MAN MARCH, MAYBE WE CAN GET A MILLION FINGER MARCH.
WITH ANY HOPE THE REST OF SOCIETY CAN SEE IT HAPPEN AND SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, I CAN DO
THAT TOO IF I FEEL LIKE IT.
>> ROBERT IS DEFINITELY A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COURAGE TO DO WHAT ROBERT DOES,
AND ON ANOTHER LEVEL, IT MAY TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STUPIDITY.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON.
>> BEING AN [BLEEP] BASICALLY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE JOB OF A POLICE OFFICER SOMEWHAT MORE ENTERTAINING.
>> Stephen: SO ON BEHALF OF POLICE OFFICERS THROUGHOUT 4-||||||
