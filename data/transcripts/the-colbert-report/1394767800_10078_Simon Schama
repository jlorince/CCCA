AND IT'S 1,000 BECAUSE ACTUALLYWE KNOW THAT-- THERE IS SOME
ARCHAEOLOGY, ACTUALLY, THAT NOWSUGGESTS THERE REALLY WERE
FORTRESSES.
WE'RE DISCOVERING EARLY HEBREWWRITINGS.
IT'S VERY EXCITING ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen:  ONE OF THE MOSTSURPRISING THINGS, I UNDERSTAND
EARLY ARCOLOGICAL EVIDENCE SHOWSTHERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
PAGANISM INVOLVED IN JEWISHLIFE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  HOW?
ISN'T THE WHOLE THING THATTHEY'RE MONOTHEIST AND INVENTED
THAT.
>> YES, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
GOD IS SUPPOSED TO BE FORMLESS,FACELESS, INVISIBLE.
HE'S NUMBER ONE.
"THOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER GODBEFORE ME."
MEANING THERE'S A LINE QUEUINGUP, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen:  IT WASN'T THATTHERE WEREN'T OTHER GODS.
IT'S "I'M YOUR STEADY."

AND I CAN MAKE THE OTHERSONES GO AWAY IF I WANT TO."
IT'S ONLY WITH-- PALESTINE, THEHOLY LAND, ISRAEL IS FULL OF
THESE LITTLE FIGURINES, SOME OFWHOM REPRESENTED THE WIFE OF GOD
ASHARA.

ARE LADIES THERE-->> YOU'RE DOING IT EXACTLY
RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  SISTERS DOING ITFOR THEMSELVES?

>> SO THE RABBIS WERE UNEASYWITH THAT.
DD CUP, DOUBLE D CUP-- IT'SABSOLUTELY TRUE.

WROTE THE BIBLE AND ALL THATGOOD STUFF.
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR MELATELY?
AND I DON'T MEAN-- I DON'T MEANJUST MY WRITERS.
>> JERRY SEINFELD.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, BUT THAT'SAFTER 1492.
WHAT ARE GREATEST--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IS JUDAISM-- IS IT A RELIGIONOR IS IT A CULTURE.
IF IT'S JUST A CULTURE, I WANTTO DENY MY WRITERS THE ABILITY
TO TAKE OFF THEIR CRAZYHOLIDAYS.
I'M SORRY, TO GET BACK TO THEQUESTION I INTERRUPTED YOU FROM
ANSWERING, IS JUDAISM-->> JEWS COMMUNICATE BY AGREED
MUTUAL INTERRUPTION.
SO NOW, YOU'RE EVEN MORE JEWISHTHAN YOU YOU THINK YOU ARE.

IT HAS TO START WITH RELIGION,BUT RELIGION IS KIND OF
ELASTIC.

KOSHER."

MOVE AROUND A BIT.
>> Stephen:  ARE YOU IMPLYINGTHERE MIGHT BE PARTS OF THE
BIBLE THAT ARE CONTRADICTORY?
( APPLAUSE ).
