(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THAT'S IT FOR THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE'VE GOT TO GO.
BUT IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE
IMPATIENT TYPES WHO FAST
FORWARDED HERE TO SEE HOW
TONIGHT'S EPISODE ENDED,
WELL, THE BELOVED DOG LIVED.
(LAUGHTER)
IN THEIR HEARTS FOREVER.
BUT ACTUALLY GOT CAUGHT IN A
WHEAT THRESHER.
I KNOW, IT'S SAD.
BUT IN HERE, IT WILL BE
ALIVE FOREVER.
