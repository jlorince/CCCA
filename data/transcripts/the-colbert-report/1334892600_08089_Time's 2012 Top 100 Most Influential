>> WELCOME BACK, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, I KNOW, I KNOW I'M NOT PERFECT.
I HAVE FLAWS.
FOR INSTANCE, I OCCASIONALLY BELIEVE I'M NOT PERFECT.
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT'S NICE TO GET SOME VALIDATION FROM SOMEONE OTHER THAN ME
AND THAT GUY WHO APPEARS IN THE WINDOW OVER MY BATHROOM SINK EVERY MORNING.
HE IS OBSESSED WITH SHAVING ME.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO THRILLED THIS WEEK WHEN "TIME" MAGAZINE REVEALED ITS 100
MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
>> "TIME" MAGAZINE JUST NAMED ITS 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD FOR 2012, ADELE O BAMA,
BOTH, MITT ROMNEY, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, WARREN BUFFETT.
>> ALSO PART OF THE TIME 100,
POLITICAL PUNDIT STEPHEN COLBERT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I AM ONE OF 1900 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOOO!
WHOOO!
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS W THIS KIND OF POWER I BETTER BE CAREFUL WHERE I POINT THIS THING.
I MIGHT INFLUENCE SOMEONE.
LIKE YOU, MOONBEAM.
PUT DOWN THE DOOBIE AND COME TO JESUS.
(LAUGHTER) AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THIS GREAT PICTURE OF ME INSIDE, HOLD ON LET ME GET
TO THIS THING.
LOOK AT THAT.
ALL RIGHT?
LOOK AT THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE PHOTO.
AND I WAS PARTICULARLY HONORED THAT IT'S ACCOMPANIED BY A PROFILE OF MEAN BY
DOONESBURY CREATOR GARRY TRUDEAU.
GARRY AND I MET WHEN HE WAS ON THE SHOW.
IT WAS A VERY BRIEF ENCOUNTER SOW NEVER REALLY GOT TO KNOW THE INNER ME.
LUCKILY, THERE IS NO INNER ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT MI ONLY ONE OF THE 100 PEOPLE LONG ERRED.
SO LET'S SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON THE OTHER I WHAT TO SAY LIKE 84.
BECAUSE I AM UP THERE WITH SOME BIG NAMES.
PEOPLE WHO SHAPE OUR WORLD.
ANGELA MERKEL, CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU,
PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL,
AND OF COURSE SARA BLAKELY,
THE INVENTOR OF SPANX.
SHE PERHAPS HAS SHAPED OUR WORLD MORE THAN ANYONE ON THIS LIST.
YES, THEY HONOR ALL THE HEAVY HITTERS.
LEADERS OF INDUSTRY, HEADS OF STATE, PIPPAS OF MIDDLETON.
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK "TIME" MAGAZINE FOR THIS HONOR, AND SINCE MI
CURRENTLY SO INFLUENTIAL,
LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO INFLUENCE YOU.
PLEASE PUT ME ON THE LIST NEXT YEAR.
(LAUGHTER) I NEED THIS MI LIKE A FRAGILE ORCHID AND THE INTENTION OF THE MEDIA IS MY ONLY SUNLIGHT.
PLEASE, I CAN'T BREATHE.
PLUS THIS IS MY SECOND APPEARANCE ON THE TIME 100.
I'M JUST ONE AWAY FROM BEING ON ITS LIST THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIMES AT THE DALY LAMBI.
I'M GUNNING FOR YOU LAMA.
I WANT TO MAKE YOU WISH YOU WERE NEVER REBORN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
