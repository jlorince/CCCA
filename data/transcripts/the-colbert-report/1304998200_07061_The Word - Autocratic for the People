AND FOLKS, WE NEED, WE NEED
ECONOMIC HELP.
LUCKILY IT IS A STORY THAT
BRINGS ME HOPE AND TO
TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AUTOCRATIC FOR THE PEOPLE.
FOR EXAMPLES, AMERICA IS
STRAPPED FOR CASH AND PRETTY
SOON CHINA IS GOING TO START
SCREENING ITS CALLS.
AND RECENTLY, STANDARD &
POOR'S THREATENED TO
DOWNGRADE AMERICA'S AAA BOND
RATING.
AT WHICH POINT THE DOLLAR'S
VALUE WOULD BE MAINLY AS A
SOURCE OF FIBER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS
NOT JUST A NATIONAL PROBLEM.
STATE AND CITY GOVERNMENTS
ARE IN TROUBLE TOO.
AND YOU CAN'T JUST BURN DOWN
A PLACE LIKE DETROIT FOR THE
INSURANCE MONEY.
AND IT SEEMS--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NO ONE KNOWS
DEBT LIKE MICHIGAN.
WHICH HAS BEEN BROKE SINCE
THE LAST DODGE POLARA ROLLED
OFF THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND
STRAIGHT INTO A SINK HOLE
THAT USED TO BE A PUBLIC
PARK.
MICHIGAN HAS COME UP WITH A
GREAT WAY TO HANDLE THE DEBT
CRISIS IN BENTON HARBOR, A
PREDOMINANTLY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY
THAT IS THE POOREST CITY IN
MICHIGAN.
WHICH IS LIKE BEING THE
OLDEST MEMBER OF "60
MINUTES."
NOW--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: TO MAKE THE CITY
SOLVENT THE STATE OF
MICHIGAN APPOINTED A GUY
NAMED JOSEPH HARRIS TO BE
SOMETHING CALLED THE
EMERGENCY FINANCIAL MANAGER.
OR EFM.
WHICH I ASSUME IS PRONOUNCED
EF-EM.
AND FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
DID HE EVER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: JIM?
>> ON FRIDAY THE 8
COMMISSIONERS AND MAYOR
WILSEY COOK EVED A COPY OF
THIS ORDER FROM JOSEPH
HARRIS THE STATE APPOINTED
EMERGENCY MANAGE NEVER
CHARGE.
WITH GOVERNOR RICK SNIDER'S
SUPPORT, EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY, THEIR POWER AND
AUTHORITY WAS STRIPPED.
COMMISSIONERS WOULD ONLY BE
ABLE TO CALL MEETINGS TO
ORDER, APPROVE MINUTES AND
ADJOURN MEETINGS.
>> Stephen: THIS TAKES ALL
POWER AWAY FROM THE LOCAL
ELECTED OFFICIALS.
BUT HARRIS IS STILL WILLING
TO LISTEN TO ALL THE VOICES
IN CITY GOVERNMENT BECAUSE
THEY ARE ALL NOW HIS VOICE.
>> SO THE FACT OF THE MATTER
IS CITY MANAGERS NOW GONE, I
AM CITY MANAGER.
I WILL TAKE-- I'M THE
FINANCE DIRECTOR THE CITY
MANAGER, THE MAYOR AND THE
COMMISSION.
AND I-- .
>> Stephen: OR AS HIS PRESS
SECRETARY LATER CLARIFIED --
>> I AM THE LAW!
HARRIS HAD TO STRIP THE
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF
THEIR POWER OR THEY MIGHT
HAVE OPPOSED HIS IDEAS TO
SAVE MONEY LIKE MERGING THE
FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS.
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
CHEAPEST WAY TO GET A CAT
OUT OF A TREE IS YOU JUST
SHOOT IT DOWN.
FOR SOME REASON, THE LOCAL
OFFICIALS DIDN'T ENJOY THIS
ELECTORAL CASTRATION.
SO LAST WEEK CITY
COMMISSIONERS PASSED A
RESOLUTION RESCINDING THE
EMERGENCY FINANCIAL MANAGER.
BUT HARRIS IMMEDIATELY
RESCINDED THEIR RESCINDING
ON THE LEGAL GROUNDS THAT
THEY CAN KISS HIS ASS.
I SAY-- GOOD FOR HIM.
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF BENTON
MARBER BROUGHT THIS ON
THEMSELVES.
A CITY OF 10,000 PEOPLE,
SADDLED WITH $6 MILLION OF
DEBT.
THAT'S $600 PER PERSON.
BENTON HARBOR'S ELECTED
OFFICIALS ARE INCOMPETENT,
THEREFORE BY ELECTING THEM
THE VOTERS ARE INCOMPETENT.
SO THEY SHOULD LOSE THEIR
DEMOCRACY.
NOW--
(APPLAUSE)
DO NOT GET ME WRONG.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
DEMOCRACY WORKS SOMETIMES.
JUST NOT, JUST NOT TO SOLVE
A FINANCIAL CRISIS LIKE
THIS.
NOW SOME MIGHT SAY YOU ARE
ONLY SAYING THIS BECAUSE
BENTON HARBOR IS 9 O-- 90%
BLACK.
WRONG.
I DON'T SEE RACE.
BUT I DO KNOW THAT CERTAIN
PEOPLE DON'T PUT ENOUGH
THOUGHT INTO VOTING FOR
THEIR LEADERS.
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.
A LOT OF THEM ARE UNEMPLOYED.
THEY'RE REALLY INTO SPORTS.
AND THEY LOVE WHITE WOMEN.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING
ABOUT.
AMERICANS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OUR NATIONAL
DEBT--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, FACE IT,
OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS 14
TRILLION DOLLARS.
TO DIVIDE THAT BY $300
MILLION AND EVERY AMERICAN
OWES 47,000 OR 80 TIMES AS
MUCH PER CAPITA AS THE
PEOPLE OF BENTON HARBOR.
SO CLEARLY WE'RE NOT GOING
TO VOTE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.
AMERICANS HAVE PROVED THEY
DON'T KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR
THEM.
SO I AM NOW CALLING CAN FOR
THE APPOINTMENT OF A
NATIONAL EMERGENCY FINANCIAL
MANAGER.
HE OR HIM WILL BE GIVEN
TEMPORARY ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY
TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS LIKE
SHOULD WE PUT OUR SENIORS ON
TO ICE FLOES OR IS IT MORE
COST-EFFECTIVE TO JUST TURN
THEM INTO SOIL ENT GREEN.
NOW I'M-- SOYLENT GREEN.
NOW I'M SURE THAT SOME
PEOPLE WILL COMPLAIN, BUT IF
PEOPLE TAKE TO THE STREETS,
CAN DISPERSE THE CROWDS WITH
HIS NEW POLICE FIRE VEHICLES.
OF COURSE, CRUSHING CAN
DISSENT WILL BE A BIT OF A
DOWNER SO THE NATIONAL EFM
WILL HAVE TO BUILD NATIONAL
MORALE WITH THE MILITARY
PARADE.
PEOPLE LOVE MISSILES.
AND THEY'LL GET TO SEE THE
PROGRAMS THAT WILL NEVER BE
CUT CAN.
AND IF THERE SHOULD COME A
DAY THAT THE EFM HAS
OVERREACHED AND COME TO
POWER TOO LONG WE CAN RISE
UP AGAINST HIM, UNITED BY A
COMMON GOAL.
TO END TYRANNY AND INSTALL A
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF THE
PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE AND
FOR THE PEOPLE.
AND YOU CAN BET WE WILL MAKE
