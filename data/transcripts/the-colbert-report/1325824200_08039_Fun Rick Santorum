LITTLE LATE.
THE GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS
HEATING UP, ROMNEY AND
SANTORUM TIED IN IOWA, PERRY
SOLDIERING ON.
AND MICHELE BACHMANN
DROPPING OUT TO SPEND MORE
TIME FIERCELY STARING AT HER
FAMILY.
AND FOLKS, I AM PSYCHED.
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT OURSELVES
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED GOP
HORSE RACE.
AFTER HIS SURPRISE PHOTO FIN
ANYBODY IOWA, RICK SANTORUM
IS THE NEW GOP GOLDEN BOY.
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY RON PAUL
HAS TRIED TO STAMP HIM INTO
COINS.
JUST ONE DAY SINCE THE
CAUCUSES, SANTORUM RAISED A
MILLION DOLLARS OR AS RICK
PERRY CALLS IT, FIVE IOWA
VOTES.
FOR THE SANTORUM SURGE JUST
GOT REAL, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
BECAUSE HE HAS CAUGHT THE
NOTICE OF THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL VOICE OF THE
19th CENTURY, GEORGE WILL.
WHO PUBLISHED A PRO SANTORUM
OP ED ENTITLED SUDDENLY A
FUN CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FUN!
AND IF ANYBODY KNOWS FUN
IT'S GEORGE WILL.
AFTER ALL, A BOW TIE IS JUST
A NECKTIE THAT'S DOING THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW LISTEN, LISTEN TO WILL
EXPLAIN ALL THE FUN, QUOTE
SPORKTSING AROMNEY STILL
SEEMS TO MANY LIKE A DUTY.
SUPPORTING SANTORUM SEEMS
LIKE A LARK.
REPUBLICANS SUPPOSEDLY
HIERARCHICAL ACTUALLY CRAVE
FUN.
YES, THEY CRAVE FUN.
BECAUSE WITHOUT FUN WHAT
WOULD REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN
AGAINST.
AND FOLKS, YOU WANT FUN.
SANTORUM IS THE LIFE OF THE
PARTY.
HECK, HE'S THE PRO-LIFE OF
THE PARTY.
THERE'S THIS GREAT DRINKING
GAME WHERE YOU TAKE A SHOT
EVERY TIME HE SAYS THE WORD
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION.
JIM, LET'S.
>> LET'S HE GO BACK TO THE
LATE 1990s AND THE ISSUE OF
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION.
>> PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION.
>> PARTIAL WIRTH ABORTION.
>> PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH FUN FOR NOW
