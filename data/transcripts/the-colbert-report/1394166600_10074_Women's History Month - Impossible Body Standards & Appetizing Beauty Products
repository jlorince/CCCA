AND FOLKS, FOLKS, THAT LANDMARKRULING COULD NOT
HAVE COME AT A MORE APPROPRIATETIME BECAUSE WOMEN'S HISTORY
-- I'M SORRY.
I MEANTWOMYN'S HERSTORY MONTHSTRATION.
FOR THE RECORD, I WON'T BEMENTIONING ANY AFRICAN AMERICAN
WOMEN.
YOU ALREADY HAD YOUR HISTORYMONTH.
DON'T GET GREEDY.
BUT I DO WANT TO TALK TONIGHTABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S CLOSE TO
ALL WOMEN'S HEARTS-- WOMEN'SBODIES.
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ONWOMEN TO BE THIN THESE DAYS, AND
ALL DAYS.
NOW, SOME WOMEN SAY, "SCREW IT.
I'M BIG.
I'M BEAUTIFUL.
DEAL WITH IT."
LIKE KERRY WASHINGTON, WHOSHOWED UP AT THE OSCARS WITH A
HUGE BEER GUT.
BRAVE YOUNG LADYBUT SADLY, MANY FALL VICTIM TO
SOCIETAL PRESSURE.
IN THE U.S. ALONE, 20 MILLIONWOMEN SUFFER FROM AN EATING
DISORDER AT SOME TIME IN THEIRLIVES.
AND IT'S STARTING EARLIER ANDEARLIER.
DID YOU KNOW SOME WOMEN ONLYWEIGH 8 POUNDS?
STOP READING "COSMO."
AND IT'S NOT JUST HOW MUCHLADIES LOSE.
IT'S WHERE THEY LOSE IT FROM.
>> THE DANGEROUS THIGH GAPTREND.
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS?
THIS IS AN OBSESSION AMONG SOMEYOUNG WOMEN TO GET SO SKINNY
THAT THEIR THIGHS DON'T TOUCHWHEN THEIR FEET ARE TOGETHER.
>> RUNWAY MODELS HAVE IT.
>> WOMEN DANGEROUSLY OBSESSEDWITH GETTING A THIGH GAP.
>> Stephen:  YES, YOUNG GIRLSARE OBSESSED WITH HAVING A THIGH
GAP.
I BLAME THE IMPOSSIBLE BODYSTANDARD SET BY SPONGEBOB.
( LAUGHTER )THEN AGAIN, THEN AGAIN IT DOES
MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THIS GUY.
AND IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT 40%OF WOMEN FEEL THEY ARE
CONSTANTLY DIETING.
THE OTHER 60% ARE STARTING THEIRDIETS TOMORROW.
I SWEAR.
FOLKS, TO ME, IT'S OBVIOUS WHATIS GOING ON HERE-- SOCIETY HAS
INTRINSICALLY LINKED A WOMAN'SVALUE TO HER OUTWARD APPEARANCE
THEREBY UNDERMINING HER STATUSAND STRENGTHENING THE
PATRIARCHAL HEDGEMONEY.
WHAT?
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, WOW!
I JUST GOT A MASTERS IN WOMEN'SSTUDIES FROM WELLESLEY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND I DESERVE THIS, FOLKS.
I DESERVE THIS BECAUSE I HAVELEARNED A TON ABOUT THE LADIES
FROM WATCHING THEIR COMMERCIALS.
FOR INSTANCE, I KNOW WHICHSHAMPOOS MAKE THEIR HAIR MOVE IN
SLOW MOTION.
I KNOW THE CHEESE THAT MAKESTHEM LAUGH.
AND I KNOW THE TAMPONS THAT HELPTHEM RIDE BIKES.
THAT'S JUST FOR LADIES.
I TRIED USING ONE IN SPIN CLASSAND ENDED UP IN THE EMERGENCY
ROOM.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AS A FEMINIST-- I UNDERSTANDCHICAGO HAS A NAKED BIKE RIDE
EVERY SUMMER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
MIGHT COME IN HANDY.
FOLKS, AS A FEMINIST, I SAYWOMEN NEED TO GIVE
THEMSELVES A BREAK.
THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUTA NEW PRODUCT THAT LETS WOMEN
ENJOY ALL THE FOOD THEY WANT,JUST NOT WITH THEIR MOUTHS.
>> EXPERIENCE THE UNIQUE COOLINGSENSATION OF FROZEN YOGURT.
NEW DIAL FROZEN YOGURT BODYWASH.
WRAP YOUR SKIN IN COOLINGMOISTURE FOR SKIN SO
REFRESHINGLY SOFT, PEOPLE WILLNOTICE.
>> Stephen:  YES, HE NOTICEDTHAT SHE SHOWERED WITH FROZEN
YOGURT AND HE'S ASKING TCB WHYDID YOU DO THAT?
( LAUGHTER )NOW, FOLKS, BESIDES FROZEN
YOGURT, DIAL IS ALSO RELEASING AGREEK YOGURT BODY WASH.
I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T MAKE ONEOUT OF THAT JAMIE LEE CURTIS
POOP YOGURT BECAUSE IT COULDMAKE FOR A MESSY SHOWER.
BUT YOGURT'S NOT THE ONLY THINGON THE MENU.
THE BEAUTY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX ISSERVING AN ALL-YOU-CAN'T-EAT
BUFFET.
>> TODAY'S MENU-- JUICYPOMEGRANATE, PERSIMMON, AND
LYCHEE SURPRISE.
POSITIVELY DELICIOUS.
>> AVOCADO,OLIVE, AND ALMOND.
>> THESE, THESE, AND THESE GO INHERE SO YOU CAN LOOK LIKE THIS.
>> IF YOU THINK YOU LIKE HOTCINNAMON BUNS OR HOT COCOA OR
COBBLER OR PINK FROSTED LAYERCAKE TO EAT, YOU HAVEN'T LIVED
UNTIL YOU SHOWER WITH THESEITEMS.
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen:  LADIES, ARE YOU
GETTING THIS?
YOUR LIFE IS INCOMPLETE IFYOU'RE NOT BATHING IN CAKE.
AND THESE PRODUCTS DON'T JUSTMAKE YOU LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO
EAT.
THEY MAKE YOU EDIBLE.
AND ISN'T MAKING WOMEN INTO ACONSUMABLE PRODUCT WHAT THE
BEAUTY INDUSTRY IS ALL ABOUT?
BECAUSE ONCE YOU SMELL LIKE YOUHAD A THREE-WAY WITH THE KEEBLER
ELF AND COOKIE PUSS, MEN WILLEAT YOU UP.
>> MY AGREE!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )I ONLY HAVE ONE CRITICISM.
WHY ARE WOMEN BEING PORTRAYED ASNOTHING MORE THAN SWEET LITTLE
THINGS?
WHY CAN'T THEY BE SAVORYENTREES?
I DREAM OF A DAY WHEN YOUNGWOMEN LOOFA WITH A PORTERHOUSE
STEAK, USE A MASHED POTATOCONDITIONER AND A MANWICH
SELF-TANNER.
( LAUGHTER )THIS IS WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH,
GODDAMN IT.
AND I SAY IT'S TIME TO SEE WOMENAS MORE THAN JUST PIECES OF MEAT
BECAUSE NOW WE CAN GET THEM TOMARINATE THEMSELVES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
