THE ROCK WORLD.
RETIREES GET VERY FEW HONEY
DIPPED COEDS WAITING IN THE
WINGS.
THE GROUPIES ARE OF A MUCH
LOWER CALIBRE, WHY ARE YOU
WALKING AWAY, SIR?
>> IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.
I'M 41 AND AT A CERTAIN
POINT I THINK IT GETS
EMBARRASSING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T START
UNTIL YOU WERE IN YOUR 30s,
RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT LIKE BIEBER AT
41.
SO-- THOUGH THAT IS SOME
LOVELY HAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M NOW MANAGING BIEBER
AT 41.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> NOW THAT'S IN MY HEAD.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN LIKE YOUTH ROCKER.
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF
DOING YOUR OWN THING.
YOU'RE POPULAR, MAN.
>> I MEAN, HI A
LIFE-- BECAUSE IT STARTED
LATER I HAD A LIFE
BEFOREHAND AND THERE ARE A
LOT OF THINGS I WANT TO
DO-- .
>> Stephen: LIKE WHAT, WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO DO
AFTERWARDS.

LIKE MAYBE GET-- I HAD A JOB,
I HAVE A LABEL I RUN, I
PRODUCE-- .

>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE
GOINGING TO BE THE MAN NOW.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE MAN.
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO
YOUNG ROCKERS, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I DON'T HEAR A SINGLE.
>> LET'S PUT A REGULAR AYE
BEAT ON THAT AND ADD
SOME-- WE'LL GET SHAGGY TO
SING WITH YOU.
THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU NOW.
I JUST THINK, I DON'T THINK
ROCKERS GET TO WALK AWAY.
THERE ARE ONLY THREE WAYS TO
END YOUR CAREER AS A ROCKER.
OVERDOSE, OVERSTAY YOUR
WELCOME, OR WRITE SPIDERMAN
THE MUSICAL.
THAT'S IT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> I WANT TO TRY TO DO ALL
THREE.
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANY OF
THOSE THREE.

THIS IS YOUR LAST
APPEARANCE.
>> YES.

LCD SOUNDSYSTEM, YOU BROUGHT
THE EQUIP KMENT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO A SONG.
