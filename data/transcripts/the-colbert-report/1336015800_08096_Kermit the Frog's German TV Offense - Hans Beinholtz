>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, I CARE ABOUT EVERY GUEST WHO COMES ON MY SHOW.
AND BECAUSE I CARE SO MUCH, I WAS SAD TO LEARN OF SOME LEGAL TROUBLE FOR ONE OF MY RECENT
GUESTS MR. KERMIT T. FROG, WHO HOPPED BY LAST MONTH TO ANNUALIZE THE SOUTHERN
REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES WHILE ALSO ANALYZING HOW MUCH CHILDREN YOUNG AND OLD WOULD ENJOY THE
MUPPETS ON DVD AND BLU RAY.
THAT'S HOW THIS PUNDIT GAME WORKS-- YOU GIVE AND YOU GET.
THAT'S WHY WHENEVER KARL ROVE DROPS BY FOX NEWS HE PLUGS HY-LINE OF HOME EXERCISE VIDEOS,
ATTACK ABS.
A 10-MINUTE WORKOUT TO GIVE YOU A BODY SHE'LL WANT TO ROVE.
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES JUST DON'T GET HOW TV WORKS.
BECAUSE MY FRIEND KERMIT HAS BEEN BOOKED FOR ILLEGAL ADVERTISING ON GERMAN TV.
AND NOT,AISE FIRST ASSUMED, FOR HIS FULL FRONTAL NUDITY.
JIMMY!
JIMMY, PLEASE, BLUR THAT OUT!
OKAY.
YOU SEE, BACK IN NOVEMBER,
KERMIT WAS OVER IN GERMANY DOING A JUNKET FOR HIS UPCOMING MOVIE "THE MUPPETS." JIM.
WOW, IT IS DISTURBING TO HEAR KERMIT SPEAK GERMAN.
ALTHOUGH, I SUPPOSE IT SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING GIVEN HOW MUCH HE LOVES PORK ?ITSER.
PORK SCHNITZEL.
THE PROBLEM IS DURING ONE GUEST APPEARANCE ON ZEEBEN'S "DISNEY
DAY," KERMIT PLUGGED HIS MOVIE IN VIOLATION OF GERMAN MEDIA LAW WHICH BANS PRODUCT PLACEMENT
UNLESS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS SUMP, UNLIKE IN AMERICA, WHERE ADVERTISING CALLS ATTENTION TO
ITSELF BY BEING EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
FOLKS, THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
HOW COULD GERMANY DO THIS TO A BELOVED CHILDREN'S ICON?
WELL, HERE TO ANSWER FOR HIS COUNTRY, PLEASE WELCOME THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, THE HONORABLE HANS BEINHOLTZ.
( APPLAUSE ) WELCOME, MR. AMBASSADOR.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  NOW, I SEE YOU'VE BROUGHT YOUR OWN WHIMSICLE CHARACTER.
HEY THERE, BIG, FELLA, WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
>> HIS NAME IS KOOKOO MCBUTTONS.
( LAUGHTER ) BUT HE DOES NOT SPEAK.
FOR HE IS ALIVE WITH A PIECE OF CLOTH.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, THEN WHY DOES HE HAVE EYES AND A MOUTH?
>> THAT HE MIGHT GAZE INTO THE NAUGHTINESS AND SCREAM SILENTLY AT THE HORROR OF HIS NONEXISTENCE.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  OKAY, UH, FINE.
BUT, YOUR EXCELLENCY, KERMIT IS REAL.
AT LEAST TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS WHO BELIEVE IN HIM, AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT ONE OF THOSE BOYS
RIGHT NOW.
>> LIES.
ALL PUPPETS ARE LIES.
WITH THEIR SMILING FACE THAT HIDES THE DECEITFUL HEART.
IT HAS NO SOUL.
IT HAS NO DREAMS.
>> Stephen:  IT'S JUST A HARMLESS PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
KERMIT WAS THERE TO PROMOTE HIS MOVIE.
>> KERMIT WAS MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM FOR HIS OWN PROPAGANDA AND PUTTING ON A HAPPY FACE AND
SINGING SILLY SONGS.
HE PRETENDS TO ENJOY WANT HOST AND LAUGH AT HIS JAPES AND JESTS.
IN TRUTH, IT IS A VIOLENT FRAUD.
HE LOVES ONLY HIMSELF.
GLI DON'T ACCEPT THAT FOR A MINUTE!
WHEN KERMIT OFFICE MY SHOW HE HAD A GREAT TIME.
HE LAUGHED AT ALL OF MY JOOO...
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OH, NO.
>> WHO NOW IS THE PUPPET?
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
