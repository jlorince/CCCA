FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS SAIDTHERE NOTHING MORE AMERICAN
THAN OUR CORPORATIONS.
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THEIRSLOGANS: AMERICAN RUNS ON
DUNKIN', CHEVROLET, THEHEARTBEAT OF AMERICA, SEARS
WHERE AMERICA SHOPS.
RADIO SHACK WHERE AMERICALOUDLY ASKS WHERE THE
HEARING AID BATTERIES ARE.
(LAUGHTER)AND I JUST HOPE THAT
AMERICA'S CORPORATIONSCANNOT HEAR THE ATTACKS
COMING FROM THE C.E.O. OFSOCIALISM.
>> THERE'S SMALL BUT GROWINGGROUP OF BIG CORPORATIONS
THAT ARE FLEEING THE COUNTRYTO GET OUT OF PAYING TAXES.
WELL, HOLD ON, THEY'RE NOTACTUALLY GOING ANYWHERE,
THEY'RE KEEPING MOST OFTHEIR BUSINESS HERE, THEY'RE
TECHNICALLY RENOUNCING THEIRU.S. CITIZENSHIP.
THEY'RE DECLARING THEIR BASESOMEPLACE ELSE EVEN THOUGH
MOST OF THEIR OPERATIONS AREHERE.
YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARECALLING THESE COMPANIES
CORPORATE DESERTERS.
>> CORPORATE DESERTERS.
SO THEY LIKE DESSERT.
(LAUGHTER)HE'S NOT ONLY ATTACKING
CORPORATE PROFIT, NOW HE'SFAT SHAMING.
FOLKS, WHAT THIS SKINNYBITCH IS TALKING ABOUT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IS A HOT NEW BUSINESS
INNOVATION KNOWN ASINVERSION, WHERE TO ESCAPE
AMERICA'S BRUTAL CORPORATETAX RATE COMPANIES RENOUNCE
THEIR U.S. CITIZENSHIP BYBUYING A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY
COMPANY AND THEN DECLARINGTHAT ITS U.S. OPERATIONS ARE
OWNED BY ITS NEW FOREIGNSUBSIDIARY, NOT THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.
IT'S LIKE ME ADOPTING ANAFRICAN CHILD, THEN CLAIMING
MYSELF AS HIS DEPENDENT.
(LAUGHTER)I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
THIS STRATEGY ISCALLED-- THE STRATEGY IS
CALLED INVERSION BECAUSEAFTERWARDS THE C.E.O.
CELEBRATES PAYING NO TAXESWITH KEG STANDS.
AND FOLKS, INVERSION IS ALLTHE RAGE THESE DAYS.
FOR INSTANCE, AMERICA'SCHIQUITA CORPORATION HAS
DECIDED TO BE OWN BYFYFFES, A MUCH
SMALLER FRUIT PRODUCER FROMWELL-KNOWN BANANA PRODUCER
IRELAND.
THAT'S WHY BANANAS START OUTGREEN.
I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE THEYARE LEPRECHAUN PENISES.
AND-- (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT IBELIEVE.
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND FOLKS, CORPORATIONS HAVE
A CLEAR DUTY TO INVERT.
>> THE MANAGEMENT OF THECOMPANY HAS A FIDUCIARY
LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PRODUCEA PROFIT.
AND THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO DOTHAT.
>> THEY OWE IT TO THEIRSHAREHOLDERS TO GET THE
GREATEST PROFIT POSSIBLE.
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITHIT. INVERSIONS ARE LEGAL,
SIMPLE AS THAT.
>> Stephen: YES, AND IFSOMETHING IS LEGAL, YOU
SHOULD ALWAYS DO IT.
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TOJAPAN ON MY NEXT VACATION TO
HUNT DOLPHINS.
I'M COMING TO GETYOU, YES I AM, I'M GOING TO
GET YOU.
(LAUGHTER)THEY LOVE IT THEY LIKE IT.
GIVE THEM A LITTLE HEADSTART.
GIVE THEM A HEAD START.
