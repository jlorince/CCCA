( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) â™ª
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, FOLKS, IT IS THURSDAY,
THE THIRD AND FINAL AND ALSO FOURTH NIGHT OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.
TONIGHT, ARE MITT ROMNEY OFFICIALLY ACCEPTS THE NOMINATION.
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIS, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, BUT
I KNOW IT WAS ELECTRIC, OR AT LEAST STATIC ELECTRIC.
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE GOOD BECAUSE LAST NIGHT WAS A BARN BURNER AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THE
GOP WANTS TO CUT FUNDING TO FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
THEY HAD, LAST NIGHT THEY HAD MINORITY SPEAKERS, A BUNCH OF THEM.
WHATEVER, WHATEVER A GROUP OF MINORITIES IS CALLED.
A LIKE A PRIDE?  A GAGGLE?  A TOKEN.
A TOKEN OF MINORITIES.
FOLKS, THIS IS GREAT, BECAUSE ROMNEY IS HAVING A TOUGH TIME ATTRACTING CERTAIN MINORITIES.
>> IN THE LATEST NBC WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL HE IS LITERALLY ZERO PERCENT WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS.
THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING 94.0 SUPPORT AND ROMNEY IS GETTING ZERO.
>> SURE, SURE, ZERO IS LOW, BUT AFTER TONIGHT'S SPEECH, I BELIEVE HE COULD TRIPLE THAT.
ANYWAY, NO SURPRISE THAT THE AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT WAS MOSTLY WHITE.
IN FACT, ON CROWD SHOTS, I HAD TO TURN DOWN THE BRIGHTNESS BECAUSE IT WAS BURNING OUT MY TV SCREEN.
BUT THE HARDWORKING RNC CAMERA MEN KEPT THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE.
THEY GOWNED A BUNCH OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.
JUST LOOK AT FOX.
THEY HAD THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HAT.
FORCE FORMS THEY HAD THIS DIFFERENT GUY.
AND THEN MY OLD BUDDY WHITE HAT AGAIN.
FOR SOME REASON THE CAMERA JUST LOVES HIM.
WELL DONE, REPUBLICANS.
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US CONSERVATIVES TO REACH OUT TO MINORITIES.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE SO MANY IN MY AUDIENCE.
I MEAN; ISN'T THAT RIGHT?  ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
>> ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE MEMBER.
>> ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: NOW, WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SIR?
>> DEREK.
>> Stephen: KEEP IT REAL, MY BROTHER.
, AND, HEY LOOK, OVER THERE AT THAT OTHER GUY.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SIR?
>> ERIC.
>> Stephen: WHAT IT IS, ERIC.
>> WORD TO YOUR MOTHER, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
I WILL GIVE THAT TO HER.
ALL RIGHT.
AND OH, LOOK, LOOK WAY UP THERE.
THERE IS A BLACK WOMAN.
TELL ME YOUR NAME, MISS.
>> ERIC A.
>> Stephen: ERIC A?  ARE YOU SURE IT IS NOT MORE DIFFERENT THAN THAT?
>> TYLER PERRY'S ERICA.
>> Stephen: WELL, ANYWAY,
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU AFRICAN-AMERICANS HERE TONIGHT.
