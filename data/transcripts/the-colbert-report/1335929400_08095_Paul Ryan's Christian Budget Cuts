(LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT, OBAMA'S ALSO
WAGING A WAR ON RELIGION.
HE HASN'T CELEBRATED A SINGLE RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY SINCE EASTER.
OH, SURE, HE'LL THROW TOGETHER AN EGG ROLL ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN BUT WHERE WAS HE ON THE
CELEBRATION OF APRIL 24, THE FEAST DAY OF ST. FIDELIS OF SINGH MAR-INGEN WHO WAS BEATEN
TO DEATH BY CALVINISTS IN 1622 MO WHO ALSO CUT OFF HIS LEFT LEG.
TRADITIONALLY, YOU SERVE LEG.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) WELL, FOLKS, DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.
THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION.
OUR MONEY SAYS "IN GOD WE TRUST." OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
NAME-CHECKS THE CREATOR AND WHEN CONGRESS PASSES A LAW, IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.
(LAUGHTER) SO WE HAVE TO BE GUIDED BY CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES.
AND YET PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ATTACKING THE TSE CREDIT AND DEEPLY CHRISTIAN REPUBLICAN
HOUSE BUDGET WRITTEN BY MY FELLOW CATHOLIC, CONGRESSMAN AND REAGAN HAIR REENACTOR PAUL RYAN.
(LAUGHTER) JUST BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PLAN GETS 62% OF ITS CUT-- $3.3 TRILLION-- FROM LOW-INCOME
PROGRAMS WHILE PRESERVING TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY, OBAMA BLASTED RYAN.
>>
>> THIS CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICAN BUDGET IS A TROJAN HORSE.
DISGUISED AS DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A RADICAL VISION ON OUR COUNTRY.
IT'S THINLY VEILED SOCIAL DARWINISIM.
>> Stephen: HOW DARE YOU, SIR?
THESE ARE REPUBLICANS.
IT IS THINLY-VAILED SOCIAL CREATIONISM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) UH-UH.
UH-UH.
UH-UH.
AND NO ONE LEGISLATES IN A MORE CHRISTIAN WAY THAN CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN.
>> OUR PRESENT STATE IS CENTRAL TO HOW THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES.
IN PUBLIC AND IN PRIVATE.
THE PREFERENTIAL OPTION FOR THE POOR WHICH IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY TENETS OF THE CATHOLIC SOCIAL
TEACHING MEANS DON'T KEEP PEOPLE POOR, DON'T MAKE PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SO THAT
THEY STAY STUCK IN THEIR STATION IN LIFE.
>> Stephen: YES!
HELPING THE POOR KEEPS THEM STUCK IN POVERTY.
AS JESUS SAID "TOUGH LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF.
GET YOUR OWN LOVES AND OFFICIALS." (LAUGHTER) NOW, SADLY, PRESIDENT OBAMA
ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WAGING A WAR ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
SO IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
BECAUSE THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS FIRED OFF A LETTER TO RYAN SAYING "A JUST
SPENDING BILL CANNOT RELY ON DISPROPORTIONATE CUTS IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO THE POOR
AND VULNERABLE PERSONS.
IT REQUIRES SHARED SACRIFICE BY ALL." SHARED SACRIFICE?
THAT'S JUST BISHOP CODE FOR RAISING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY.
HOW DARE THEY?
(LAUGHTER) JESUS HIMSELF SAID "RENDER UNTO CESAR WHAT IS CESAR'S AND HIDE
IN THE CAYMAN WHAT IS IS THE CAYMANS" (LAUGHTER) BUT RYAN WAS NOT DAUNTED BY THE
BISHOP'S ATTACK.
HE TOOK HIS MINISTRY TO THE PREEMINENT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY,
GEORGETOWN.
>> I SUPPOSE THERE ARE THAT THERE ARE SOME CATHOLICS WHO FOR A LONG TIME THOUGHT THAT THEY
HAD A MONOPOLY OF SORTS.
NOT EXACTLY ON HEAVEN, BUT ON THE SOCIAL TEACHING OF OUR CHURCH.
>> Stephen: SADLY CAR, THOL SCHISM IS FULL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY
ON INTERPRETING THE SOCIAL TEACHING.
THEY'RE CALLED BISHOPS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT THESE GUYS DON'T COUNT BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
ISN'T KNOWN FOR ITS CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY (LAUGHTER) CATHOLICISM IS MORE OF A DIALOGUE.
EVERYBODY TOSSES IN THEIR TWO CENTS AND DECIDES WHAT THE BIBLE MEANS FOR THEMSELVES.
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO STARTED THAT.
IT WAS EITHER POPE MARTIN LUTHER OR POPE HENRY VII.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, TECHNICALLY,
TECHNICALLY, A CATHOLIC CAN'T SAY THE BISHOPS ARE WRONG EXCEPT THE HOLY FATHER.
SO FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS TALK OF PAUL RYAN BEING VICE PRESIDENT.
I SAY WE MAKE HIM VICE POPE.
NOW, WHEN WE RETURN I WILL TALK TO A MAN WHO MAY OPPOSE PAUL RYAN'S SELF-APPOINTMENT TO THE VATICAN.
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S FATHER THOMAS REESE
