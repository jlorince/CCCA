VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS
MEETING IN NEW YORK THIS
WEEK.
IT ALWAYS HAS A BIG EFFECT
ON THE CITY AS FOOD VENDORS
ABANDON THEIR CARTS TO
REPRESENT THEIR COUNTRIES.
(LAUGHTER)
A LOT OF WORLD LEADERS ARE
GETTING ATTENTION, PERHAPS
NONE MORE SO THAN THE KENYAN
DELEGATE PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IT DOES NOT TAKE ANY
TIME AT ALL FOR OBAMA TO
EMBARRASS AMERICA.
JIM.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A
PHOTO FAIL DURING A UNITED
NATIONS GROUP PICTURE
TUESDAY NIGHT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HAND
COMPLETELY OBSCURED THE MAN
STANDING NEXT TO HIM.
WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE
PRESIDENT OF MONGOLIA.
>> Stephen: NO SURPRISES
THERE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS OBAMA HAS
SHOWN NO RESPECT FOR OUR
ALLIES IN ULAN BATUR SINCE
DAY ONE.
HE IS CLEARLY SHOWING NO
RESPECT FOR HIS EXCELLENCY
PRESIDENT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> SAKI-SAKIHAGI, GANGUS
YERKYAK OVER HERE.
NOW I PERSONALLY CANNOT
IMAGINE HOW UP SET HE MUST
BE.
JIMMY, IS THERE ANY WAY WE
CAN SEE HIS FACE?
(LAUGHTER)
THERE YOU GO, LOOK HOW SAD
HE IS.
>> AH!
>> Stephen: YEAH SO, SAY
GOOD-BYE TO OUR VITAL ALLY

WHEN HE TOOK ON THE BIGGEST
ISSUE OF THE WEEK.
PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT
ABBAS'S PLAN TO INTRODUCE A
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR U.N.
RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN
STATE.
AND JUST LISTEN TO OBAMA'S
SPEECH CALLING FOR PATIENCE
FROM THE PALESTINIANS.
>> PEACE IS HARD.
PEACE IS HARD WORK.
THAT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES
PEACE SO HARD.
PEACE IS HARD BUT WE KNOW
THAT IT IS POSSIBLE.
PEACE IS HARD.
(LAUGHTER)
PEACE IS HARD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
PEACE IS HARD.
UNLIKE WINNING THE NOBEL
PEACE PRIZE WHICH IS
SURPRISINGLY EASY.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
NOW FOLKS, THERE IS NO
GREATER FRIEND OF THE STATE
OF ISRAEL THAN YOURS TRULY.
I WILL STAND WITH THEM UNTIL

BUILD THE SECOND TIFERP EL,
TRIGGER THE FINAL BATTLE OF
ARMAGEDDON THAT PAVES THE
WAY OF THE SECOND COMING OF
CHRIST AT WHICH POINT ALL
NONCRIST-- CHRISTIANS WILL
BE CAST INTO THE LAKE OF
FIRE WHERE THERE WILL BE
WEEPING AND NASHING OF
TEETH.
