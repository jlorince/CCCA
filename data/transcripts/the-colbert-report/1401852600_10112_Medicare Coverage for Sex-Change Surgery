>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY!
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,FOLKS, BUT I FOR ONE GREW UP IN
A TIME WHEN THE GENDERS WERECLEARLY DEFINED.
ONE WAS THE BREADWINNER,PANTS-WEARER AND
CHANNEL-CHANGER-HAVER.
THE OTHER WAS THE NURTURER,EMOTION-HAVER, AND WAS
TRIANGLE-SHAPED.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NOW MEN ARE BECOMING WOMEN,
WOMEN ARE BECOMING MEN, AND MYINBOX IS BECOMING FULL OF YOUR
ANGRY LETTERS EVERY TIME I TALKABOUT IT.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
I'M CIS-HETERO NAZI SCUM.
I ACCEPT YOUR JUDGMENT.
BUT NOW THE TRANS-GENDERS ARETRANS-FORMING A NEW SEGMENT OF
AMERICA.
>> MEDICARE PATIENTS MAY NOWAPPLY TO HAVE SEX CHANGE
OPERATIONS FUNDED BY YOU, THETAXPAYER.
AN APPEALS BOARD FOR THEDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES SAYS THERE IS NOJUSTIFICATION FOR A
THREE-DECADE-OLD RULE EXCLUDINGTHE PROCEDURE.
>> MEDICARE COVERS 49 MILLIONSENIOR CITIZENS.
IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MANY MIGHT BEAFFECTED BY THE RULING.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: WHO KNOWS?
COULD BE ALL 49 MILLION.
OF COURSE THEN IT'S GONNA BE THELGBT AARP.
(APPLAUSE)THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND
HUMAN SERVICES RULED THAT THESURGERY IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE
AND CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDEREDEXPERIMENTAL.
BUT I SAY THIS RULING IS JUST ASLIPPERY SLOPE TO ALL OF US
PAYING FOR GRANDMA'S HUMANCENTIPEDE SURGERY, WHICH IS JUST
A SCAM TO SCORE GROUP DISCOUNTSTO THE LION KING.
BUT EVEN MORE DISTURBING THANTHE IDEA OF NANA AND PEE-POP
PLAYING MR. POTATOHEAD"DOWNTOWN"...
IS THAT IT VIOLATES THE TACITAGREEMENT WE'VE REACHED WITH THE
TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY.
I AGREE TO BE TOTALLY COOL WITHIT.
WHICH I CLEARLY AM.
WHICH "TIME MAGAZINE" CLEARLY ISAND WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE
LOBBYING FOR THIS TRANSGENDEREDWOMAN TO BE A VICTORIA'S SECRET
MODEL CLEARLY ARE...
AS LONG AS YOU ARE HOT.
BUT NOW YOU WANT ME TO ACCEPT"UNATTRACTIVE" TRANSGENDERED
PEOPLE?!
WHERE DOES IT END?
WILL I HAVE TO ACCEPTUNATTRACTIVE "NON"TRANSGENDERED
PEOPLE?
WHAT AM I, MADE OF, HUMANITY?I!
BESIDES, MEDICARE PAYING FORTHIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
GOVERNMENT WASTE.
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, AFTER ACERTAIN AGE, WHO CAN REALLY TELL
MEN AND WOMEN APART?
(LAUGHTER)THEY HAVE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF EAR
HAIR, THE SAME PAPERY SKIN, EVENTHE SAME COLOGNE.
(LAUGHTER)   SO INSTEAD OF TAXPAYERS
SPRINGING FOR SOME EXPENSIVESURGERY TO TURN A MAN INTO A
WOMAN, JUST GIVE HIM AFLORAL-PRINT MUUMUU.
WATCH, JIMMY, PUT UP AN OLD MAN.
NOW THE MUUMUU.
(LAUGHTER)TA-DAA!
(APPLAUSE)   YOU'RE WELCOME!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
