>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,EVERYBODY.
IT'S GOOD TO YOU HAVE HERE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOUKNOW I LOVE OUR NATION'S
AMBASSADORS.
WHAT I CAN SAY, I'M A BIT OFAN AMBASSMAN, THAT IS WHY I
HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THESENATE CONFIRMATION OF U.S.
AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY.
THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE GOTA LOT OF ATTENTION FOR BEING
A BOLD CHOICE AND ALSO ABEAUTIFUL ONE.
>> A SOAP OPERA PRODUCERJUST BECAME THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR TO THE COUNTRY OFHUNGARY. SHE'S THE PRODUCER
OF THE TV SHOW "THE BOLD AND THEBEAUTIFUL"
>> YES, COLLEEN BELL, AFORMER "THE BOLD AND THE
BEAUTIFUL"" PRODUCER IS NOWTHE AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY.
AND ONE ASSUMES ITS EVILTWIN, SERGIO.
AND SURE, COLLEEN BELL HASNO EXPERIENCE WITH FOREIGN
SERVICE OR SPECIAL KNOWLEDGEABOUT THE NATION HUNGARY.
BUT FOLKS, SHE WAS NOMINATEDFOR THE MOST NOBLE OF ALL
REASONS, SHE CONTRIBUTED$800,000 TO OBAMA IN THE
LAST ELECTION AND BUNDLEDMORE THAN $2.1 MILLION FOR
PRESIDENT OBAMA'SRE-ELECTION EFFORT.
HEY, FOLKS, THAT IS JUSTQUID PRO QUO.
YOU SCRATCH THE PRESIDENT'SBACK, HE APPOINTS YOU
AMBASSADOR OF SCRATCHBACKISTAN.
BUT THE CONFIRMATION TOOK ASHOCKING TWIST WHEN LONG
TIME FRIEND OF THIS SHOWSINCE MONDAY, JOHN McCAIN,
RIPPED BELL ON THE FLOOR OFTHE SENATE.
>> THERE IS NO IT DOUBT THATSINCE TAKING OFFICE IN 2010,
THE HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTERMR. VICTOR ORBAN HAS
CENTRALIZED POWER.
MR. ORBAN IS COZYING UP TOVLADIMIR PUTIN.
>> I AM NOT AGAINSTPOLITICAL APPOINTEES.
I AM NOT AGAINST-- IUNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME IS
PLAYED. BUT HERE WE ARE,A NATION THAT IS ON THE
VERGE OF CEDING ITSSOVEREIGNTY TO A
NEO-FASCIST DICTATOR GETTING INBED WITH PUTIN AND WE'RE GOING
TO SEND THE PRODUCER OF "THEBOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL".
>> Stephen: WELL, WHO DO YOUWANT, JOHN?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, SOMEONEFROM "THE YOUNG AND THE
RESTLESS"?
THEY WOULD BE TOOINEXPERIENCED, THEN GET
BORED AND QUIT.
FOLKS, JOHN McCAIN IS DEADWRONG HERE.
I HAVE DEEP ROOTS IN HUNGARY.
I HAVE A BRIDGE NAMED AFTERME THERE.
AND THE HUNGARIAN AMBASSADORHIMSELF MADE ME AN HONORARY
CITIZEN.
MY ONLY QUALIFICATION, I AMON TV.
RIGHT THERE.
THERE'S YOUR PROOF.
AND FOLKS, "THE BOLD AND THEBEAUTIFUL" IS PERFECT
TRAINING TO BE ANAMBASSADOR.
HUNGARY IS A REGION RIFEWITH DRAMA AND THE CONSTANT
THREAT-OF-VIOLENCE.
EXACTLY THE SITUATION THE FORRESTER FAMILY ROUTINELY
HANDLED FROM THEIRPALLACIOUS ESTATE WHILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING THEIRFASHION EMPIRE.
AND I AM CONFIDENT IFCOLLEEN BELL WAS ABLE TO
HANDLE THE ON-AGAIN,OFF-AGAIN MARRIAGE BETWEEN
SALLIE'S DAUGHTER MACYALEXANDER AND THORN FORRESTER
WHOM SHE EVENTUALLY LOST TOBROOK ONLY TO REUNIT WITH HIM
BEFORE FALLING IN LOVE WITHRECOVERING ALCOHOLIC DEACON
SHARP, OF COURSE THAT WASBEFORE SHE FELL INTO A COMA
AND HER FAMILY PULLED THEPLUG, THEN YEAH, I THINK
COLLEEN BELL CAN HANDLE ASHIRTLESS GUY ON A PONY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THE POINT IS, COME ON, COME
ON.
AMATEUR HOUR.
THE POINT IS, I FULLYSUPPORT COLLEEN BELL'S
APPOINTMENT.
TO BE THE AMBASSADOR -->> STEPHEN, WAIT.
>> DR. DELVECCHIO, WHAT AREYOU DOING HERE?
>> YOU CAN'T LET COLLEENBELL BE AMBASSADOR TO
HUNGARY.
SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED.
AND I SHOULD KNOW, I'M HERLESBIAN LOVER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: BUT-- BUT DOCTOR,
YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.
>> MAYBE.
OR MAYBE I HAD A SEXUALREASSIGNMENT SURGERY TO
BECOME A MIDDLE-AGED ITALIANMAN.
>> Stephen: BUT, BUT THATWOULD MEAN --
>> I'M CARRYING YOUR BABY.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHY DOES THAT MAKECOLLEEN BELL UNQUALIFIED?
>> OH, I'LL TELL YOU.
