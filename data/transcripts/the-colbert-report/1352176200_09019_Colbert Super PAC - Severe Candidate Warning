FOLKS, I THINK-- I THINK THAT PROVES THAT M ITT IS A CANDIDATE JUST AS SERIOUS AND SINCERE AS I AM.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN MY WORDS, HIS MOUTH.
I FEEL LIKE I'M A BILLIONAIRE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW OF COURSE THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT MITT'S CAMPAIGN AND MY SUPER PAC ARE
COORDINATING IN ANYWAY.
IN FACT, I HAVE NO OFFICIAL RELATIONSHIP TO EITHER CAMPAIGN.
I HAVEN'T EVEN SIGNED UP FOR ANY OF THEIR E-MAILS BUT SOMEHOW AND THIS IS TRUE,
LAST WEEK THE OBAMA PEOPLE JUST FOUND ME.
AND HAVE BEEN SENDING ME E-MAILS.
OF COURSE IT JUST STARTED LAST WEEK SO I'VE ONLY RECEIVED 600 OF THEM.
(LAUGHTER) BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS FROM LITERARY LEGEND AND ONLY POET YOU EVER HEARD OF
MAYA ANGELOU.
MAYA WROTE-- GO!
RISE UP.
AND LET YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN EARLY VOTING STATES.
GO WHERE THEY CAN GO TODAY.
WE MUST MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD.
(APPLAUSE) I KNOW WHY THE CAGE BIRD-- NO DOUBT THE GOP IS SENDING OUT E-MAILS FROM
ROMNEY POTE LAUREATE KID ROCK.
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WATERER TO WATER, BANG A DANG DIGGY DIGGY DIGGY TAX CUTS!
FUN FACT, LIKE THE OTHER KIDS WHO SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY,
