(LAUGHTER)I JUST HOPE THE EUROPEANS CAN
FIND IN THE THEIR HEARTS TOTRUST US AGAIN SO THEY'LL START
TALKING ABOUT THINGS ON THEPHONE THAT ARE WORTH LISTENING
TO.
HERE TO TELL ME IF THEY EVERWILL IS PULITZER PRIZE WINNING
NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENTFOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" MARK
MAZZETTI.
MARK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)GOOD TO SEE YOU.
OKAY, YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF "THEC.I.A. SECRET ARMY AND WAR AT
THE ENDS OF THE EARTH CALLED THEWAY OF THE KNIFE."
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
ARE WE DOING THIS?
>> YEAH, IT SEEMS THAT CERTAINLYTHE U.S. IS DOING PRETTY MUCH
MOST OF WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTEDOVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS,
INCLUDING AS HAD BEEN REPORTEDIN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THE
SPYING ON DOZENS OF WORLDLEADERS THAT -- AND IT COULD BE
MORE.
>> IS THAT NORMAL?
HAVE WE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ALONG TIME OR IS THIS THE SORT OF
THING THAT OBAMA STARTED?
>> I DON'T THINK OBAMA STARTEDIT.
I THINK IT WAS GOING ON BEFOREOBAMA.
IT WAS CLEARLY GOING ON DURINGPRESIDENT BUSH.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BECAUSE HESAYS HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
HAPPENING.
DO WE BELIEVE THAT?
>> WELL, IT'S -- IT'S HARD TOIMAGINE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
KNOW ALL OF THESE LEADERS'COMMUNICATIONS HAD BEEN TAPPED.
>> Stephen: THE ULTIMATEQUESTION IS, IS OBAMA BLAMELESS
OR CLUELESS?
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, YOU'RE SEEING REAL
SNIPING GOING ON BETWEEN THEWHITE HOUSE AND THE N.S.A. ABOUT
WHETHER THE N.S.A. IS THIS ROGUEORGANIZATION OR WHETHER THIS WAS
ALL APPROVED AT THE HIGHESTLEVELS.
>> Stephen: IS IT POSSIBLETHERE'S SOMEBODY HIGHER THAN
OBAMA THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?
>> NOT THAT I KNOW OF, NO.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHINGWRONG WITH DOING THIS?
I SAY BIG WHOOP.
>> WELL, IS THE RISK OF GETTINGCAUGHT WORTHWHILE?
>> Stephen: IT'S BETTER TO NOTKNOW WHAT ANGIE MERKEL IS
TALKING ABOUT ON HER CELL PHONE.
>> THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOUGAINING FROM IT?
AND NOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHTWHAT IS THE DAMAGE GOING TO BE?
SOME OF THIS IS FOR POLITICAL --DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION IN GERMANY
AND FRANCE BUT THERE DOES SEEMTO BE GENUINE SURPRISE AMONG
THESE LEADERS.
>> Stephen: SOME OF IT IS FORDOMESTIC CONSUMPTION.
SOME OF THIS OUTRAGE IS JUST TOMAKE PEOPLE AT HOME FEEL NICE
ABOUT THEIR LEADER OBJECTING TOUS SPYING ON THEM?
>> THEY CAN'T SAY THEY'RE HAPPYABOUT IT SO THEY HAVE TO SAY
THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT IT BECAUSETHERE IS ANGER ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: DON'T THE GERMANSSOUND LIKE THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING?
(LAUGHTER)EASY FOR THEM.
>> Stephen: .
>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THATCONVERSATION WAS BETWEEN MERKEL
AND OBAMA.
>> Stephen: HERE'S MYATTITUDE: THE UNITED STATES HAS
TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OFRELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTRIES
AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
EITHER YOU'RE TECHNOLOGICALLYADVANCED FOR US TO SPY ON
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING,LISTENING TO YOUR PHONE CALLS,
SENDING YOU MESSAGES THROUGHYOUR MICROWAVE OR YOU LIVE
SOMEPLACE THAT'S FULL OF SANDAND ROCKS AND WE BLOW YOU UP
WITH DRONES.
(LAUGHTER)SO THEY SHOULD BE THANKING US
FOR NOT SENDING OVER OUR OTHERTECHNOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)>> SOMEONE SHOULD TELL HER THAT.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT THIS IS A ONE-WAY STREET,
RIGHT?
WE SPY ON THEM, THEY DON'T SPYUS ON, RIGHT?
>> WELL, EVERYONE SPIES PRETTYMUCH ON EACH OTHER.
THE UNITED STATES HAS A ARELATIONSHIP WITH A GROUP OF
ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES WHERETHERE IS A NO SPYING
ARRANGEMENT.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE ENGLISHSPEAKING COUNTRIES WE DON'T SPY
ON?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I CAN THINK OF ONEENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY WE
DON'T SPY ON.
(WHISPERS)>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WE DON'T HAVE THATDEAL WITH OURSELVES YET.
WHAT ABOUT LIKE FRANCE?
WE SPY ON THEM.
>> WE SPY ON THEM; THEY SPY ONUS.
>> Stephen: THEY SPY ON US?
WHY AREN'T WE BOMBING THELOUVRE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE A NATIONAL SECURITY
CORRESPONDENT.
DOES THIS MAKE YOUR JOB HARDER,ALL THESE N.S.A. SNOWDEN LEAKS?
ARE PEOPLE LESS LIKELY TO TALKNOW?
>> THERE HAS BEEN A SUCCESSIONOF LEAK PROSECUTIONS AND TRYING
TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE INFORMATIONREPORTERS GET.
SO OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR,YEAR AND A HALF, IT'S BEEN
HARDER FOR NATIONAL SECURITYREPORTERS TO DO THEIR JOBS
BECAUSE OF THIS CLIMATE OFINVESTIGATION.
>> WHEN YOU CALL PEOPLE UP FORSOURCES ON A NATIONAL SECURITY
STORY DO THEY SAY "NO, MARKMAZZETTI, I'M NOT INTERESTING IN
TALKING TO YOU, I LOVE MYCOUNTRY!"
CLICK.
>> Stephen: THERE IS SOME OFTHAT.
YOU HAVE THESE VERY STRANGECONVERSATIONS WHERE PEOPLE SAY
"WHOEVER'S LISTENING TO THISCALL LET IT BE KNOWN I'M NOT
REVEALING CLASSIFIEDINFORMATION.
>> Stephen: WHOEVER'S WATCHINGTHIS SHOW I'M NOT REVEALING
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
MARK MAZZETTI, THANK YOU SOMUCH.
"THE WAY OF THE KNIFE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH."
