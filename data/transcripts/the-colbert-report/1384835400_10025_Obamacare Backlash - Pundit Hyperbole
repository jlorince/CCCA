(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, LIKE ALL OF YOU, I HAVE
ENJOYED WATCHING OBAMA'SSIGNATURE PIECE OF LEGISLATION
UNRAVEL LIKE A LOOSE BURRITO INA BACKPACK.
(LAUGHTER)I DO NOT THINK THERE HAS BEEN A
TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN APRESIDENT GOT THIS UNPOPULAR
THIS FAST-- OTHER THAN THAT ONETIME.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PREDICAMENTHAS PROMPTED COMPARISONS WITH
WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS AT THISPOINT IN HIS PRESIDENCY AND THE
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE KATRINA.
>> IS THIS OBAMA'S POLITICALKATRINA?
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S EXACTLYLIKE KATRINA BUT, OF COURSE,
THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T SAYTO PRESIDENT OBAMA!
>> BROWNIE, YOU'RE DOING A HECKOF A JOB.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
(LAUGHTER)OH, OH, OH, THAT IS JUST WRONG.
BECAUSE HE'S NOT DOING A HECK OFA JOB.
THE POINT IS, OBAMA COULDN'TMAKE HEALTH CARE WORK, SO HIS
LEGACY IS NOW SET-- BAD AT USINGTECHNOLOGY TO EXTEND LIFE, GOOD
AT USING TECHNOLOGY TO END IT.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)AND THIS FAILURE GOES BEYOND THE
WEB SITE, FOLKS.
REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENTREPEATEDLY SAID "IF YOU LIKE
YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN KEEP IT."
BUT NOW MILLIONS OF PLANS AREBEING CANCELED.
SO LAST WEEK, THE PRESIDENT HELDA PRESS CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS
THE PROBLEM.
JIM?
>> OH, THE HUMANITY!
>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO!
JIM, NO, WRONG DISASTER.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK CNN'S THE DON LEMON PUTOBAMA'S PUBLIC IMPLOSION INTO
THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE.
>> YOU WON'T FIND TWOPOLITICIANS WHO'VE HAD WORSE
WEEKS THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA ANDTORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD.
THEY'VE HAD A PRETTY BAD WEEK.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYING SORRY
OVER AND OVER FOR HIS SO-CALLEDSIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT,
OBAMACARE, ROB FORD ADMITTING TOBE A CRACK SMOKER.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: YES, OBAMA IS INTHE SAME TIGHT SPOT AS TORONTO'S
CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR.
I MEAN, THE PARALLELS AREEVERYWHERE, FOLKS.
BOTH HAD PRESS CONFERENCES-- ANDTHAT'S IT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, FOLKS, COMPARING THE FIRST
BLACK PRESIDENT TO THE FIRSTBLACKOUT MAYOR ISN'T UNFAIR.
IT'S NOT UNFAIR AT ALL BECAUSELEMON MADE SURE TO ASK SEVERAL
TIMES WHETHER IT WAS UNFAIR ORNOT.
>> IS IT FAIR, THOUGH, TOCOMPARE THE TWO CRISES?
>> NO, IT'S NOT FAIR TO COMPARETHEM AT ALL.
THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
>> I'LL ASK YOU THE SAMEQUESTION.
IS IT FAIR TO COMPARE THE TWOCRISES?
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT DAMAGECONTROL NOT WHETHER THE TWO
CRISES ARE EQUIVALENT.
>> EXACTLY AND I THINK IT'S FAIRTO MAKE A COMPARISON FOR THE
SIMPLE FACT THAT BOTH OF THEMARE IN TROUBLE.
>> Stephen: YEAH, THEY'RE BOTHIN TROUBLE.
THEREFORE, IT'S AN ENTIRELY FAIRCOMPARISON.
THE SAME WAY THAT SINCE THEY'REBOTH ON VIDEO, IT'S FAIR TO
COMPARE DON LEMON'S REPORTING TOTHIS DOG MILKING A GOAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELL, I'VE GOT TO SAY, CHUCK
