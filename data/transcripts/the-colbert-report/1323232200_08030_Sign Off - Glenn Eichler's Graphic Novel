>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR "THE COLBERT
REPORT."
BUT BEFORE WE GO, I WANT TO
MENTION A NEW GRAPHIC NOVEL BY
ONE OF MY WRITERS, GLEN EICHLER.
IT'S CALLED "MUSH, SLED DOGS
WITH ISSUES.
REQUEST W ART BY JOE INFERNARI"
AND IT'S ABOUT THE JOSTLING FOR
POWER AMONG A GROUP OF THE
TALKING ALASKAN SLED DOGS.
FANTASTIC BOOK.
IN FACT, IT GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT HITCHING MY WRITERS UP TO
A SLED.
BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO BE WRITING BOOKS ON THE SIDE
CLEARLY I AM NOT WORKING THEM
HARD ENOUGH.
THAT'S IT FOR THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
GOOD NIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
