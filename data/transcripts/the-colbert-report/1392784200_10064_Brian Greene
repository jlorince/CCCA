( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT STUDIES THETHEORY OF RELATIVITY.
I'VE ONLY READ E EQUALS MC.
DON'T TELL ME HOW IT ENDS.
PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN GREENE!
HEY, BRIEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  GOOD TO SEE YOUAGAIN.
FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAYNOT BE, YOU ARE A THEORETICAL
PHYSICIST AT COLUMBIAUNIVERSITY, THE COFOUNDER OF THE
WORLD SCIENCE FESTIVAL.
YOUR NEW PROJECT IS WORLDSCIENCE YOU.
WHICH AIMS TO BECOME THEINTERNET'S BEST SOURCE OF
COURSES FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELYON SCIENCE. WHY
DO YOU WANT TO TEACH SCIENCEON THE INTERNET?
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE INTERNETWHEN YOU LEARNED SCIENCE?
DOESN'T THAT KIND OF-- DOESN'TTHAT KIND OF CHEAPEN SCIENCE TO
MAKE IT FREE ON THE INTERNET?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MOTIVATEDUS TO DO THIS BECAUSE NOW WE CAN
TEACH SCIENCE SO MUCH BETTERTHAN WE COULD BACK THEN.
I STRUGGLED AS A KID TRYING TOLEARN EINSTEIN'S IDEALS OF
RELATIVITY.
>> Stephen:  HEY, DUMMY, HEY,DUMMY.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.
HERE'S THE THING-- IF YOU CANSHOW THE VISUALIZATION OF THE
SLOWING OF TIME OR COMPRESSIONOF SPACE, KIDS GET IT SO MUCH
MORE EASILY THAN IF YOU JUST HADA BLACKBOARD WAY PIECE OF CHALK.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, SO YOU HAVETWO LECTURES START STARTING OFF,
IT LAUNCHES NEXT WEEK.
WORLDSCIENCEYOU.COM.
AND THE FIRST TWO LECTURES AREON THE GENERAL AND SPECIFIC--
>> BOTH ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY.
ONE VERSION IS WITHOUT MATH,JUST CONCEPTUALS.
AND ONE HAS THE EQUATIONS FORTHE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DIG IN
DEEP AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHATIT'S ALL ABOUT.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, GIVE ME THESPECIAL RELATIVITY.
GIVE ME THAT.
IS THAT A BETTER RELATIVITY THANGENERAL?
IS IT LIKE THE ADMIRAL-- YOUKNOW.
GENERAL IS LIKE COACHRELATIVITY?
>> NOW, HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE,HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE.
GENERAL, EINSTEIN TOOK GRAVITYINTO ACCOUNT AND SPECIAL
RELATIVITY, HE DIDN'T.
BUT IN SPECIAL RELATIVITY, HEFIGURED OUT SPACE AND TIME ARE
NOT WHAT WE THINK THEY ARE,RIGHT?
WE ALL HAVE THIS IN OUR MINDTHAT TIME JUST TICKS FORWARD
SECOND AFTER SECOND AFTERSECOND, LIKE THAT RIGHT THERE.
BUT THAT FOOLS US INTO THINKINGTIME WAS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE.
IF YOU WERE TO GET UP FROM THETABLE, RUN AROUND THE ROOM AND
COME BACK, YOUR WATCH WOULD TICKOFF LESS TIME THAN IT WOULD HAVE
IF YOU WERE JUST SITTING STILL.
>> Stephen:  WHY?
>> YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE COURSE,BUT HERE'S THE THING--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  SO THE FASTER IGO, THE FASTER I GO, THE LESS I
AGE.
>> IF YOU GO 99.9999999999% OFTHE SPEED OF LIGHT, YOU GO OUT
INTO SPACE FOR SIX MONTHS-- STAYWITH ME-- TURN AROUND AND COME
BACK, YOU WILL HAVE AGED ONLYONE YEAR BUT EARTH WILL HAVE
AGED 223,607 YEARS.
YOU WILL HAVE GONE A QUARTER OFA MILLION YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.
WHEN YOU TELL THAT TO A KID,SCIENCE BECOMES SOMETHING
THEY ARE NO LONGER INTIMIDATEDBY, SOMETHING THAT IS NO LONGER
BORINGTHEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen:  LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT, THE CLOSER YOU GET TO
THE SPEED OF LIGHT, THE LESSTIME PASSES FOR YOU, AND THERE'S
A RELATIVE-- RELATIVE TO THEREST OF YOUR-- REST OF THE
WORLD.
>> THE UNIVERSE, EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  IT'S GOING FASTERFOR THEM.
IF I HAVE A FLASHLIGHT AND FIRETHE FLASHLIGHT AT YOU THE FIRST
PHOTON IS COMING AT YOU AT THESPEED OF LIGHT, RIGHT?
>> IT IS, SO IS THE SECOND ONE.
>> Stephen:  THE FIRST ONE--THERE MIGHT BE A TRAFFIC JAM ON
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
CHRIS CHRISTIE MIGHT PUT UPSOME CONES.
BUT THAT PHOTON IS GOING AT THESPEED OF LIGHT, SO TIME IS NOT
PASSING FOR THE PHOTON THEN-->> YOU COULD SAY THAT.
>> Stephen:  BY THE TIME THEPHOTON GETS TO YOU, AM I DEAD?
>> I HOPE NOT.
BUT HERE'S THE THING.
IF YOU CONSIDER AN OBJECT GOINGNEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT, AT THE
SPEED OF LIGHT POETICALLY, TIMESSTOP, BUT NO MATERIAL OBJECT CAN
EVER GO AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT,SO WE WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE
THAT.
PHOTON HAS NO MASS.
>> Stephen:  HOW DOES ITTHEN-- HOW DOES THAT THING IN
THE GLASS, THAT LITTLE THINGTHAT TWIRLZ AROUND, THE LIGHT
LIGHT BULB WITH THE BLACKWHITE, FLAG THAT TWIRLZ
AROUND INSIDE.
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IT?
THERE'S A LIGHT BULB WITH ANEEDLE INSIDE AND IT HAS FLAGS
AND YOU PUT IT IN THE SUNSHINEAND IT SPINS AROUND BECAUSE THE
WEIGHT OF THE-->> OH, I KNOW THE THING THE
RADIOMETER.
LIKE LIGHT CAN PUSH.
>> Stephen:  IT HAS MASS.
>> IT HAS ENERGY.
>> Stephen:  ENERGY EQUALSMASS TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT
SQUARED BY ( BLEEP ).
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> IT HAS NO MASS IF IT WERE AT
REST.
THAT'S THE KEY THING.
>> Stephen:  BUT IT'S NOT ATREST.
>> THAT'S WHY IT CAN ENERGY.
>> Stephen:  CAN IT HAVEINFINITE MASS BECAUSE IT'S
GOING INFINITELY FAST.
>> IT HAS A FINITE AMOUNT OFENERGY. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU
CAN PUSH ON IT AND FEEL IT.
THE SUN'S HEAT GIVES ENERGY TOTHE EARTH AND ALLOWS THE PLANT
TO GROW.
>> Stephen:  I KNOW THE SUN ISHOT.
OKAY, SO IT STARTS NEXT WEEK.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, AND HOW DOPEOPLE GET TO IT
WORLDSCIENCEU.COM.
PEOPLE SHOULD GO AND SIGN UP ANDIT WILL BE A FUN RIDE.
>> Stephen:  DOES THIS COSTANYTHING?
>> NO, IT'S FREE.
>> Stephen:  THEN HOW DOES THEUNIVERSITY MAKE ITS MONEY, OFF
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK ABOUT THOSETHINGS.
I JUST WANT TO GET GOOD MATERIALOUT TO THE WORLD.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE ATHEORETICAL PHYSICIST AND A
THEORETICAL BUSINESS MAN.
>> THERE YOU ARE!
