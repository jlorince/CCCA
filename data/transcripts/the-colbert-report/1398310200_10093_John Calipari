YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH THEMSERVANT LEADERSHIP.
>> Stephen: WHAT THE HELL ISTHAT?

>> Stephen: YOU'RE EITHER ASERVANT OR YOU'RE A
LEADER.
THE LEADER LEADS THESERVANTS.
>> YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKETHEM UNDERSTAND IT'S MORE
ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS THANTHEMSELVES.
WORRY MORE ABOUT YOURTEAMMATE THAN YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOUTALKING ABOUT.
GIVE ME THE BALL, I'MSHOOTING.
>> AN IF YOU DO THAT, THEONLY WAY THEY'LL DO THAT IS
IF THEY KNOW I HAVE THEIRBACK AND I MAKE IT ABOUT
THEM, NOT ABOUT ME, NOTABOUT ME-- IT'S ABOUT ME AND
OUR STAFF AND ALL OF USBEING THERE FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU'RE CRITICIZED SOMETIMESFOR HAVING A LOT OF ONE AND
DONE GUYS, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,ONE AND DONE AND CAN THAT BE
CURED WITH VIAGRA, WHAT ISTHAT?
>> MY, I DON'T LIKE THECONNOTATION ONE AND DONE.
WE SAY SUCCEED AND PROCEED.
WHEN THEY'RE READY TO MOVEON-- .
>> Stephen: IT ALSO RHYMESSO IT MUST BE TRUE.
>> IT'S NOT BAD.
BUT THE WHOLE ISSUE FOR MEIS IF THEY'RE READY IF THEY
HAVE A GENIUS AND THEIRGENIUS IS BASKETBALL, THEIR
ATHLETICISM AND ARE READY TOMOVE ON AND TAKE ADVANTAGE,
LIKE STEVE JOBS, LIKE BILLGATES OR TIGER WOODS OR-- .
>> Stephen: NONE OF THOSEGUYS PLAYED BASKETBALL.
>> BUT THEY'RE ALL ABLE TOUSE THEIR GENIUS AND NOT
FINISH COLLEGE AND MOVE ONAND DO SPECIAL THINGS.
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY,OKAY.
DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BEONE AND DONE, DO YOU THINK
PLAYERS SHOULD STAY MORETHAN A YEAR?
>> I WOULD LIKE THEM TO STAYTWO, BUT AGAIN, THEIR
GENIUS DICTATES, IS IT TIMETO GO.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWOPLAYERS ON THIS TEAM DECIDE
THEY'RE GOING TO THE NBA,JAMES YOUNG AND JULYIANCE
RANDALL, TWO GREAT KIDS,GREAT STUDENTS, GREAT
BASKETBALL PLAYERS.
BUT IT'S TIME FOR THEM TOMOVE ON.
WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FOR ACOUPLE OF OTHERS.
A BUNCH OF OUR GUYS SAIDTHEY ARE COMING BACK.
FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVEHAD A COUPLE GUYS COME BACK,
BY THE WAY.
>> Stephen: FOR THE FIRSTTIME.
>> YES, THEY ALL LEAVE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUTYOUR LEADERSHIP THAT MAKES
PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE.
>> I THINK THEY DONE LIKEME.

>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINKTHAT PLAYERS, WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THE UNIONIZATION OFCOLLEGE PLATERS WITH SHABAZZ
NAPIER SAID AT UCONN.
DO YOU THINK PLAYERS SHOULDGET PAID?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THEYTALK ABOUT UNIONS, UNIONS
AREN'T NECESSARY IF YOUTREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY
AND TREAT THEM FAIR.
THAT'S ONE.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PAY,IT'S A COST OF ATTENDANCE.
FOR A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNGWOMAN TO BE ON A COLLEGE
CAMPUS, TO BE ON SCHOLARSHIP,BUT NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE THE
SAME LIVES AS EVERYBODY ELSEON THE CAMPUS IS A TOUGH
DEAL.
SO THE COST OF THATATTENDANCE WHICH CHANGES
FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: SO DO WE PAYTHEM?
>> YOU GIVE THEM A COST OFATTENDANCE, YES.
>> Stephen: AND THAT IS PAIDIN WHAT, CHESTNUTS AND
RABBIT PELTS, WHAT?
DO WE GIVE THEM MONEY, THEGREEN STUFF.
>> YOU WOULD GIVE THEM THATSTIPEND WHICH DOES NOT MAKE
THEM PROFESSIONAL.
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
>> THAT IS-- .
>> Stephen: DOES IT HAVEPICTURES OF PRESIDENTS ON
IT?
>> I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO ONTHIS ONE.
>> IT COULD BE IN HUNDREDS,QUARTERS, IT COULD BE IN A
CHECK, YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, HOWMUCH DO WE GIVE THESE GUYS,
YOU JUST OPENED UP A CAN OFWORMS, MY FRIEND.
IF YOU-- WHY NOT JUST GIVETHEM LIKE A SNICKERS BAR IF
THEY'RE HUNGRY.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH, BECAUSEYOU'RE NOT YOURSELF WHEN
YOU'RE HUNGRY.
>> WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TOGIVE THEM SNICKERS BAR.
WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GIVETHEM ANYTHING EXCEPT A BAGEL
AND IF WE PUT PEANUT BUTTEROR JELLY ON OR CREAM CHEESE
ON THE BAGEL, WE WERE GOINGTO JAIL.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,YOU COULD GIVE PLAYERS A
BAGEL BUT NOT CREAM CHEESE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WELL, BECAUSETHAT IS HOW YOU GET A
SLIPPERY SLOPE IS BY PUTTINGCREAM CHEESE ON THE SLOPE, IT
LEADS TO LOX, MAYBE THINSLICED ONION, CAPERS.
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS.
AND THEY CHANGED THAT RULE.
IT HADN'T BEEN PASSED YETBUT THEY SAY UNFETTERED
FOOD.
NOW WE CAN FEED THEM SIXTIMES A DAY OR FIVE TIMES A
DAY, WHATEVER AN ATHLETENEEDS.

AROUND THEM.
