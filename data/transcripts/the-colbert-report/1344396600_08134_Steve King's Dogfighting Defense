(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS.
I MEAN, HOW ENDANGERED COULD THE BLACK RHINO BE?
EVERY TIME I GO ON SAFARI I BAG ONE.
(LAUGHTER) AND SPARE ME YOUR PHONE CALLS.
I USE EVERYDAY PART OF JUST THE HORN.
(LAUGHTER) NOW LUCKILY THERE'S A HERO OUT THERE WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO STAND
UP TO THE PUPPY HUGGERS.
IOWA CONGRESSMAN AND HAUNTED ICE SCULPTURE STEVE KING RECENTLY KING SPOKE OUT AGAINST NEW
FEDERAL ANTI-DOG FIGHTING LAWS.
>> THE LEGISLATION THAT PASSED IN THE FARM BILL THAT SAID THAT
IT'S A FEDERAL CRIME TO WATCH ANIMALS FIGHT OR TO INDUCE SOMEONE ELSE TO WATCH AN ANIMAL
FIGHT BUT IT'S NOT A FEDERAL CRIME TO INDUCE SOMEBODY TO WATCH PEOPLE FIGHTING.
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PRIORITIES OF PEOPLE THAT THINK LIKE THAT.
IT'S WRONG TO RATE ANIMALS ABOVE HUMAN BEINGS.
I WILL NOT RAISE ANIMALS UP ABOVE HUMAN BEINGS.
>> THANK YOU.
IF TWO CONSENTING ADULTS WANT TO FIGHT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE W.B.A., WHY NOT TWO CONSENTING DOGS?
I MEAN, IT'S A CLASSIC CINDERELLATOR STORY.
A TROUBLED YOUNG DOG FROM A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKING FOR A WAY OFF THE STREET HEADS DOWN TO
THE GYM AND THEN CHOOSES TO ENTER THE EXCITING WORLD OF DOG FIGHTING.
A MENTOR TAKES HIM IN, TEACHES THIS DOG EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.
AND WHEN THAT DOG FEELS READY,
HE ENTERS THE RING TO PROVE TO THE WORLD AND TO HIMSELF THAT HE'S GOT THE TALENTED TENACITY
TO BE A WINNER-- OR A LOSER, IN WHICH CASE HE IS KILLED.
THAT'S HOW CINDERELLA ENDS,
RIGHT?
NOW, SADLY, KING'S WORDS WERE TWISTED LIKE THE BALL SACK OF A
ROT ROT WILER IN A PIT BULL'S JAWS.
(LAUGHTER) HE WAS SAVAGED BY THE "WE DON'T ENJOY ANIMALS BEING TORTURED FOR
OUR AMUSEMENT BRIGADE" AT THE HUMANE SOCIETY SO CONGRESSMAN KING PUT HIS DEFENSE OF DOG
FIGHTS IN A TRUE MORAL CONTEXT.
>> WHAT I SAID IS THAT WE NEED TO RESPECT HUMANS MORE THAN WE DO ANIMALS.
WHEREVER WE START ELEVATING ANIMALS TO ABOVE THAT OF HUMANS WE'VE CROSSED A MORAL LINE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE'S A SEXUAL PREDATOR OUT THERE WHO HAS IMPREGNATED A YOUNG GIRL, SAY A
13-YEAR-OLD GIRL, THAT SEXUAL PREDATOR CAN PICK THAT GIRL UP OFF THE PLAYGROUND AT THE MIDDLE
SCHOOL AND HAUL HER ACROSS THE STATE LINE AND FORCE HER TO GET AN ABORTION TO ERADICATE THE
EVIDENCE OF HIS CRIME AND BRING HER BACK AND DROP HER OFF AT THE
SWING SET AND THAT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT?
THAT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW?
(LAUGHTER) WHY NOT?
MAYBE CONGRESSMAN KICK SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT!
(LAUGHTER) WHAT WHAT?
WHAT?
I'M BEING TOLD THAT ALL OF THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW.
WELL, BRAVO, CONGRESSMAN, FAST WORK.
THE POINT IS... THE POINT IS HUMANS DO CRUEL THINGS TO EACH OTHER THEREFORE THEY MUST BE
ALLOWED TO BE CRUEL TO ANIMALS.
UNTIL THERE IS NO HUMAN SUFFERING IT'S ALI ALI OXEN FREE ON WHAT YOU'RE FREE TO DO TO
YOUR OXEN.
AND, FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST CRUEL THINGS, WE'RE ALLOWED TO WATCH PEOPLE HAVE SEX FOR MONEY.
WHY CAN'T STEVE KING WATCHDOGS HAVE SEX FOR MONEY?
FAR MATTER, WHY CAN'T I WATCH STEVE KING HAVE SEX WITH A DOG?
STOP PUTTING DOGS ABOVE STEVE KING!
I'M SURE HE'D BE THE TOP!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I GUESS... I GUESS ALL...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I GUESS ALL STEVE KING IS SAYING IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T JUDGE HIM
FOR HAVING IMPREGNATED THAT DOG AND THEN TAKING IT ACROSS THE BORDER FOR FORCED ABORTION TO
PROTECT THE WORLD FROM HIS MONSTROUS GLASSY EYED MAN PUPPIES.
(LAUGHTER) RIGHT?
RIGHT.
THAT'S GOT TO BE WHAT HE'S SAYING.
BECAUSE OTHERWISE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE (BLEEP) HE'S
