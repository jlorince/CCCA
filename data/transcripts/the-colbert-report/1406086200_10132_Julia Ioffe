>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO TALKABOUT RUSSIA AND UKRAINE.
PLEASE WELCOME JULIA IOFFE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)JULIA IOFFE, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING HERE.
YOU ARE A SENIOR EDITOR AT THENEW REPUBLIC AND YOU'VE WORKED
AS A MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT FORTHE "NEW YORKER."
YOU'RE A NATIVE RUSSIAN EVENTHOUGH YOU'RE AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, CAME HERE WHEN YOU WERESEVEN.
>> MM-HMM.
>> Stephen: WE ARE TALKING ALOT THESE DAYS ABOUT THE UKRAINE
AND RUSSIA AND THATRELATIONSHIP.
I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE STORY ANDI CARE ABOUT IT.
WHY IS IT HUGE AND WHY DO I CAREIN WAYS I NEVER CARE ABOUT OTHER
INTERNATIONAL STORIES.
I CAN IGNORE THE REST OF THEWORLD.
WHY HAS THIS GOT US ALL GRIPPED?
>> PEOPLE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THISCONFLICT VERY MUCH AT ALL.
IT HAD COME OFF THE FRONT PAGESFOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS,
NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION TOIT UNTIL A PLANE WITH CITIZENS
OF LIKE A DOZEN COUNTRIES WASDOWNED BY A MISSILE BY THESE
KNUCKLEHEADS FIGHTING IN THEREGION.
>> Stephen: IS THAT ATECHNICAL TERM?
>> THAT'S CORRECT. IT'S AN I.R.TERM.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE SPENTTIME WITH THESE RUSSIAN
SEPARATISTS IN THE UKRAINE.
>> THEY CALL THEMSELVES THEVOLUNTEERS.
THEY CALL THEMSELVES THEPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF DONETSK,
BUT THE SOLDIERS ARE CALLEDVOLUNTEERS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM
JUST PICKED UP ARMS AND WENT TOFIGHT BECAUSE THEY
WATCH A LOT OF RUSSIAN TV.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
AND RUSSIAN TV HAS, LIKE, THESHOWS LIKE "WHO WANTS TO BE A
REBEL"?
WHAT'S ON RUSSIAN TV THAT MAKESPEOPLE WANT TO FIGHT AGAINST
THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN?
>> FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS,SINCE FEBRUARY, RUSSIAN TV HAS
BEEN TELLING THEM A FASCIST HASTAKEN POWER IN KIEV, COMING TO
RAPE WOMEN, EAT THEIR CHILDRENAND BURN THEIR LAND, SO A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCARED,PICKING UP ARMS AND GOING TOFIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THEEVENING NEWS IS LIKE IN RUSSIA?
IS THERE A FREE PRESS IN RUSSIA?
>> NO, THERE ISN'T.
MOST RUSSIANS GET THEIR NEWSFROM THE TV AND IT IS MOSTLY
OUTRIGHT OWNED BY THE KREMLIN ORCOMPANIES WHO ARE LOYAL TO THE
KREMLIN.
SO THE HEADS OF THE MAJOR TVCHANNELS COME TO THE KREMLIN
ONCE A WEEK AND MEET WITH A GUYIN CHARGE OF TV AT THE KREMLIN
AND THEY SET THE AGENDA FOR THECOMING WEEK.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU MET WITH IGOR BEZLER,NICKNAMED THE DEMON.
IS HE A GOOD GUY?
>> VERY SWEET(LAUGHTER)
HE'S ACTUALLY A BIT OF A LOOSECANNON, VERY MERCURIAL
>> Stephen: IS HE ONE OF THEVOLUNTEERS?
>> HE'S ONE OF THE LEADERS OFTHE VOLUNTEERS.
HE'S NOT EVEN A UKRAINIANCITIZEN, SO IT'S WEIRD HE'S
FIGHTING FOR THIS UKRAINIANMOVEMENT, FOR UKRAINE TO SECEDE
AND JOIN RUSSIA. HE'S A RUSSIANCITIZEN
HE WAS BORN IN SOVIET CRIMEA.
>> Stephen: HE'S ONE OF THELEADERS OF THIS GROUP WHO'S
TRYING TO BREAK AWAY.
>> MM-HMM.
>> Stephen: IN DONETSK?
AM I PRONOUNCING THAT RIGHT?
>> MM-HMM.
>> Stephen: IS THAT RUSSIANFOR "LITTLE DOUGHNUT"?
>> NO, I THINK BECAUSE OF THERIVER IT'S CALLED THAT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THIS BEZLER
IS ONE OF THE GUYS WHO THEUKRAINIANS SAY THEY HAVE A
RECORDING SAYING "WE JUST SHOTDOWN A PLANE."
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: IS HE UPSET ORHAPPY THEY SHOT DOWN A PLANE.
>> HE'S A LITTLE FLUSTERED.
HE SWEARS A LOT AND SAID, MAN,SERIOUSLY, THIS IS 100% A
CIVILIAN PLANE.
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HISHANDLER IN RUSSIA IS SAYING, OH,
THEY MUST HAVE JUST BEENDROPPING OFF THEIR SPIES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSPIRACYTHEORIES IN RUSSIA AS TO WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH THISPLANE.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CRAZIERONES?
>> MY FAVORITE IS MALAYSIAAIRLINES FLIGHT 17 IS ACTUALLY
MALAYSIA AIRLINES 370 WHICH ASWE KNOW DISAPPEARED OVER THE
INDIAN OCEAN FOUR MONTHS AGO ANDWHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS IT
DIDN'T FALL INTO THE INDIANOCEAN.
THE AMERICANS TOOK IT, KILLEDEVERYONE ON BOARD, DRAINED THEM
OF THEIR BLOOD AND TOOK THEPLANE AND ALL THE CORPSES TO AN
AMERICAN MILITARY BASE, SHUTTLEDIT TO HOLLAND, RIGGED IT WITH
EXPLOSIVES -- IT'S VERYSIMPLE --
(LAUGHTER)-- AND BECAUSE TAKEOFF IS
COMPLICATED, THEY HAD LIVEPILOTS DOING THE TAKEOFF, THEN
THEY PARACHUTE OUT.
FIRST THEY PUT IT ON AUTO PILOT,PARACHUTE OUT AND THE PLANE
EXPLODES WHEN NECESSARY OVEREASTERN UKRAINE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A PLOT FROMSHERLOCK, THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF
THE SHERLOCK THE SERIES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS PUTIN GOING TOBE HARMED BY THIS?
BECAUSE WE'RE IMPOSING MORESANCTIONS, SUPPOSEDLY.
WE'RE DRAWING A LINE IN THE SANDOR AT LEAST A LINE IN THE CASH.
IS HE GOING TO CARE?
>> HE'S GOING TO CARE A LITTLEBIT, BUT HE SEES HIMSELF AS AN
HISTORICAL FIGURE THAT IS MEANTTO KIND OF RESURRECT RUSSIA,
BRING BACK ITS GREATNESS, SOHE'S WILLING TO TOLERATE
ECONOMIC PAIN TO ACHIEVE THEGOALS.
>> Stephen: IS THISNEO-SOVIET? IS IT NEO-CSARIST?
ARE THEY TRYING TO RECONSTITUTETHE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AND IF SO
SHOULD WE THROW BACK IN WITH THEAUSTRIAN HUNGARIANS AND GIVE
INDIA BACK TO THE BRITISH?
>> HE'S NOT VERY GOOD ATTHINKING LONG TERM SO HE TAKES A
LITTLE BIT FROM THIS AND THATPLAY BOOK, SO, ACTUALLY, WHEN
THE RUSSIANS TOOK CRIMEA AND THEWEST WAS ALL UP IN ARMS ABOUT
IT -- WELL, NOT UP IN ARMS, THEYDIDN'T DO ANYTHING -- THEY WERE
VERY UPSET ABOUT IT -->> Stephen: METAPHORICALLY UP
IN ARMS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE OF THE DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTERS OF THE RUSSIAN
FEDERATION SAID, WELL, WE'REGOING TO GET A TOEHOLD ON THE
MOON AND START COLONIZING THEMOON BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS ARE
WILLING TO SUFFER FOR A GREATIDEA.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINKTHEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
COLONIZE THE MOON?
DO YOU THINK THAT'S ACTUALLYGOING TO HAPPEN?
>> NO, I THINK THEY WOULD MESSIT UP ALONG THE WAY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT WOULD MAKE ITSO MUCH LESS ROMANTIC TO STAND
UNDERNEATH THE RUSSIAN MOON...
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE MADE OF
GREEN CHEESE, IT WOULD BE MADEOF BORSCHT.
(LAUGHTER)THANKS FOR JOINING ME!
JULIA IOFFE, THE NEW REPUBLIC!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
