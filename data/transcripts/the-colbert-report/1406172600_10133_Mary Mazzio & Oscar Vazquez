COLLEGIATE DIVISION OF THECOMPETITION.
OBSERVATIONLY CALLED THEEXPLORER CLASS.
IT WAS FOR MULTIFUNCTIONALREMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES.
>> WE WERE GOING WITH THEMIND-SET THAT WE WERE GOING
MAINLY AS OBSERVERS AS ANEXPLORATORY TYPE OF THING.
IF WE ENTER THE HIGH SCHOOLLEVEL AND WE GET BEAT THAT
WILL BE EMBARRASSING.

DEMORALIZED.
>> WE FIGURED IF WE ENTEREDTHE COLLEGE LEVEL AND LOST IT
WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BIGDEAL.

KNEW WE WEREN'T GOING TOWIN.
AND IF WE JUST BEAT ONECOLLEGE THAT WOULD BE
PHENOMENAL.

COLLEGE.
BECAUSE WE DO NEED ENGINEERSWHAT HAPPENED TO THE TEAM
>> WELL, AFTER GRADUATINGHIGH SCHOOL, I WENT TO
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST.
THEN I WENT TO ARIZONA STATEUNIVERSITY.
BUT DURING THAT TIME ARIZONAPASSED THE LAW THAT KIND OF
PREVENTED US FROM GETTINGSCHOLARSHIPS TO GO TO
ARIZONA STATE SO ONE OF MYTEAMMATES HAD TO DROP OUT OF
COLLEGE FOR THAT REASON.
