>> Stephen: BECAUSE "THISBOY'S LIFE" IS A COMING OF AGE
STORY IN WHICH YOU START OFF ASYOURSELF AS YOU END UP AS
LEONARDO DICAPRIO.
>> WHY DO YOU -- WHY DO YOUTHINK THIS IS A GREAT NOVEL AND
WHY DO YOU THINK IT TALKS TO OURKIDS?
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY TO BEGINWITH THAT I WISH IT WEREN'T
TAUGHT TO THE KIDS, BECAUSE -->> Stephen: AMEN.
>> PART OF THE EXPERIENCE OFFINDING THAT NOVEL FOR MYSELF
WAS THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS BEINGSUBVERSIVE WHEN I WAS READING
IT, BECAUSE HERE IS A BOOK THATWAS REALLY CALLING THE ADULT
WORLD AS I SAW IT THEN, A NESTOF HYPOCRISY, AND PHONINESS, AND
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TODISCOVER ON YOUR OWN.
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR ENGLISHTEACHER TO BE INTRODUCING YOU TO
THE HYPOCRISY OF ADULTS.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, I STILLREMEMBER THE NIGHT I READ IT.
I WAS IN A PLAY, AND I KEPTMISSING MY -- BECAUSE I WAS
READING THIS BOOK AND LAUGHINGSO HARD, SO IN HIS THRALL AND I
THINK WHEN YOU DISCOVER THE BOOKIN THAT WAY, IT STAYS WITH YOU
IN THAT WAY THE REST OF YOURLIFE.
YOU READ IT LATER, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T READ IT.
IT WAS ASSIGNED IN TENTH GRADE,AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK I GET
HOLDEN CAULFIELD BECAUSE I SAIDI AM NOT GOING TO READ THAT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: I AM MORE HOLDEN
CAULFIELD THAT HOLDEN CAULFIELD,REALLY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: DO YOU REALLYTHINK WE SHOULD TEACH THIS STUFF
TO THE KIDS?  BECAUSE IT HAD BADWORDS IN IT AND IT HAS A
PROSTITUTE IN IT AND THAT ISSOME SPICY STUFF.  DO WE NEED TO
BE REINFORCING OUR KIDS BADBEHAVIOR AS TEENAGERS WITH THE
IDEA THEY COULD BE A CHARACTERIN A GREAT NOVEL?  DAD, I WASN'T
DISOBEYING YOU, I WAS EXPLORINGMODES OF ALIENATION.
>> WELL, I WOULD CERTAINLY WANTTHEM TO BE INTRODUCED TO THAT
BOOK RATHER THAN BE TRAINED INPOMPOUSNESS, PRETENTIOUSNESS,
BOGUS SPIRITUALITY, SUCH AS YOUFIND IN THE CLASS STORIES.
>> Stephen: NOW, WAIT ASECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.
THE GLASS FAMILY STORIES, FRANNYAND ZOOEY, AND THE CARPENTERS,
EVEN DOWN AT THE DINGY IF YOUWANT TO.
>> THOSE ARE -->> Stephen: THOSE ARE SOME OF
HIS FINEST WORKS, SOME OF HISGREATEST WORKS.
YOU WILL ADMIT THAT OR YOU WILLPAY A PRICE.
>> WELL, IF YOU LIKE -->> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST THE GLASS FAMILY?
>> DO YOU LIKE TO READ SERMONSALL DAY?
>> Stephen: I GIVE THEM.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> THERE IS A WONDERFUL LITTLE
MOMENT IN CATCHER IN THE RYEWHEN HOLDEN IS TALKING ABOUT THE
PREACHERS THAT COME TO TALK INTHE CHAPEL AND -- AT -- AND HE
TALKS ABOUT THIS HOLY JOE TONETHAT THEY TAKE ON, AND ODDLY
ENOUGH THAT IS THE TONE HE TOOKON WHEN HE WAS WRITING THESE
GLASS FAMILY STORIES.
>> Stephen: BUDDY GLASS WHOWRITES ALL OF THE STORIES, IT
EVEN IMPLIES HE WROTE CATCHER INTHE RYE, EVERYTHING.
>> EVERYTHING, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HE SAYS ESSENTIALLY I KNOW THATI AM WRITING IMPERFECT STORIES
HERE AND I WILL BE GET LOST INMY OWN LO CONSTITUTIONS AND I
USE GOD IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ATHREE LETTER EXPLETIVE AND
ACTUALLY THINK OF HIM ASSERMONIZING.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING BUT ITIS A CONFESSION.

SALINGER, HOW DARE YOU LIKE HISBOOK.
