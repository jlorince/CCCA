>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF UTAH, AND AMBASSADOR TO CHINA, WOW!  THAT GUY SHOULD
RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
PLEASE WELCOME JON HUNTSMAN!  HEY!.
GOVERNOR, AMBASSADOR, SIT DOWN.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?  THANK YOU.
DO YOU LIKE GOVERNOR?  DO YOU LIKE AMBASSADOR?  YOUR EXCELLENCY?  WHAT DO YOU PREFER,
SIR?
>> YOU KNOW, HAVERHILL WHO USED TO BE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE HE WAS ONCE AMBASSADOR TO THE
SOVIET UNION AND RAN FOR PRESIDENT, HE WAS ASKED THE SAME QUESTION, HE SAID I LIKE
GOVERNOR, BECAUSE THAT WAS A JOB GIVEN DO ME BY THE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
>> SO THAT'S MY ANSWER.
>> Stephen: VERY NICE.
>> Stephen: THE FACT I AM ON THIS SHOW, STEPHEN WOULD SUGGEST OTHERWISE.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE, NOT IN TAMPA, WHERE THE CONVENTION IS GOING, DO YOU GO
TO EVERY REPUBLICAN CONVENTION SINCE REAGAN, WHY AREN'T YOU THERE, SIR?
>> I ASKED WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO DO AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO BE A SURROGATE
SPEAKER IN NEW ORLEANS THIS WEEK AND I THOUGHT, ARE THEY TRYING TO SEND ME A SIGNAL OR WHAT?
YOU COULD HAVE BROUGHT YOUR SCUBA GEAR.
HERE IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID.
HERE IS WHAT I DID SAY WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WASN'T GOING TO ATTEND.
WHEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THEODORE ROOSEVELT, GENERAL
EISENHOWER, RONALD REAGAN, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND THEY DECIDE TO BE A LITTLE MORE
INCLUSIVE AND BROADEN THE FOOTPRINT A LITTLE BIT.
>> Stephen: INCLUDING GUYS LIKE YOU?
>> I THINK YOU HAVE POINTED THAT OUT EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM.
SO A LITTLE MORE INCLUSIVE, AND WITH A LARGER OPTIMISTIC HOPEFUL MESSAGE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS
COUNTRY THAT IS BASED ON REAL SOLUTIONS, AND, YOU KNOW, BEYOND THAT, I HATE SUPER PACS.
>> Stephen: I HAD A SUPER PAC,
YOU REALIZE THAT?
>> I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE OFFENSE TO THAT, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: A BETTER TOMORROW.
JOIN.
>> SUPER PACS ARE DESTROYING THIS DEMOCRACY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAD A SUPER PAC THAT SUPPORTED YOU.
>> WE DID A CLINICAL TRIAL.
I CAN TELL YOU --
>> Stephen: A CLINICAL TRIAL?  HOW DID THE, -- HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND -- LOOK I COME FROM
BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE.
I RAN FOR GOVERNOR AND PEOPLE THOUGHT, WELL, GEE, NOBODY IS GOING TO RAISE MONEY ARE THE
GRASS ROOTS IF WE RAISE ENOUGH WE WILL WIN.
IF WE DON'T RAISE ENOUGH WE WILL KIND OF MOVE ON.
WE WON TWICE AND THEN I LOOK AT THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND WE HAD A SUPER PAC AND I HAVE TO
TELL YOU I HAVE SEEN IT FROM BOTH SIDES AND SUPER PACS ARE DESTROYING DEMOCRACY.
>> Stephen: HOW SO?  BECAUSE MONEY EQUALS SPEECH.
THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT MONEY EQUALS SPEECH.
OKAY?  THEREFORE, CORPORATIONS,
UNIONS AND INDIVIDUALS CAN SPEND UNLIMITED MONEY IN POLITICAL SPEECH OR DO YOU NOT BELIEVE
SOME PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK?
>>
>> Stephen: THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
>> WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGISLATION GOING BACK TO 71,
1972 AND THE COURT CASES AND ALL OF THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?  WE HAVE ARRIVED AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IF YOU GOT PEOPLE OF
JUST AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE IN A ROOM AND SAID CREATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS FOR THIS COUNTRY
THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH THEY WOULD COME UP WITH WHAT WE HAVE TODAY.
IT IS AN ABOMINATION.
>> Stephen: I HAVE RARELY SEEN MY AUDIENCE APPLAUD ABOMINATION.
YOU CAN REALLY MOVE A CROWD,
SIR.
>> THERE WE GO.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON NOW IN TAMPA WITH YOUR PARTY.
YOU ARE NOT THERE AND PERSON NAAH NON GRATA, DO YOU BELIEVE YOUR POLITICAL CAREER YOU WILL
BE MARGINALIZED FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS OR MORE OSTRACIZED FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS OR PUT A HIT OUT
ON YOU?  WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE?
>> ..
>> YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT POLITICAL PARTY IS THEY GO IN CYCLES AND SO WHEN
YOU SAY WHAT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TODAY I THINK IN SOME SENSE IT IS A HOLDING COMPANY
FOR FUND-RAISING AND DOING NOT ANYTHING FOR FOUR YEARS.
I SAY IT HAS TO HAVE MORE, A HEART AND SOUL AND IT HAS TO HAVE A VISION AND SOLUTIONS WHEN
IS THE LAST TIME WE SAT DOWN AS A PEOPLE AND TALKED ABOUT SOLUTIONS.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE NICE.
IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
THIS WEEK, YOU HAVE -- YOU HAVE ENDORSED MITT ROMNEY.
>> I HAVE.
>> Stephen: I ASSUME YOU SPENT THE LAST FOUR MONTHS GOING ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON YOUR DIRT
BIKE DOOR TO DOOR URGING PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR HIM?
>> WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HE IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GET THE
ECONOMY MOVING.
IT IS ALL ABOUT JOB CREATION AND LOOKING AT THE REVENUE FLOW SO WE CAN START PAYING THE BILLS
BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T PAY THE BILLS WE ARE DONE AS A COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: THIS WEEK WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE MORE WE GET TO KNOW MITT ROMNEY THE MORE WE
ARE GOING TO LIKE HIM.
YOU ARE A FELLOW GOVERNOR AND A FELLOW BUSINESSMAN AND KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS, WHAT ARE THE THINGS
THAT MAKE YOU JUST LOVE HIM AS A PERSON?
>>
>> Stephen: COUNT 5.
>> WELL, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IS A LITTLE BIT UNFAIR AS A QUESTION, BECAUSE I AM AN
INSIDER -- HE IS A.
>> Stephen: HE IS A RELATIVE.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LIKE YOUR RELATIVES.
>> WE SHARE THE SAME, GREAT,
GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER.
>> Stephen: AND YOU --
>> Stephen: AND THAT IS YOUR FAMILY.
>> AND THIS GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD 12 WIVES, HE WAS
A POLYGAMIST AND MITT CLEARLY CAME DOWN WITH A WIFE WITH BETTER HAIR.
>> Stephen: IS THAT YOURS, BY THE WAY?  OKAY.
HOLD ON.
WE HAVE TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK AND WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE GOVERNOR JON HUNTSMAN.
STICK AROUND.
