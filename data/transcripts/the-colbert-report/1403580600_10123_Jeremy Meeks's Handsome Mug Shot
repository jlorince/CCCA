EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU,FOLKS, AS A MILLENNIAL, I ALWAYS
KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST HASHTAGMEMES FROM THE AT INTERNET DOT
APP.
FOR INSTANCE, HAVE YOU SEEN THEIRAQI MILITARY SPOKESMAN
WHOSENAME IS SAAD MAAN?
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THE SITUATIONTHERE IS TRAAGAAC.
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER STAR BLOWINGUP THE INNER TUBES RIGHT NOW,
AND HIS NAME IS JEREMY MEEKS.
AND HE'S YOUR CLASSIC BAD BOY.
IN THAT POLICE IN STOCKTON,CALIFORNIA, BELIEVE HIM TO BE
QUITE DANGEROUS.
>> MAN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIAWILL BE FORMALLY CHARGED TODAY
IN A WEAPONS CASE, BUT THAT ISNOT WHY HE'S GETTING ALL THIS
ATTENTION. LOOK AT THIS FACE.
>> MEET JEREMY MEEKS.
HIS MUGSHOT HAS GONE VIRAL.
ALL OVER FACEBOOK AND ALL OVERTHE WORLD.
ON STOCKTON'S PAGE, MORE THAN24,000 LIKES AND MORE THAN.
6,000 COMMENTS.

I'D MAKE HIM FORGET WHY HE BROKEIN WITHIN 30 SECONDS. LOL."
LEIDY SANTIAGO: "I'VE GOT 50SHADES ON THAT MAN! OH GOD YES!

JUST LOOK AT HIM,THAT JAW LINE, THOSE BABY BLUES.
I MEAN GUN TO MY HEAD, I BELIEVETHAT'S WHAT HE'S IN FOR.
FOLKS, MEEKS' FANS SEE HIM ASMORE THAN A PRETTY FACE.
THEY BELIEVE HE HAS THE SKILLSTO TURN AROUND HIS LIFE USING
HIS PRETTY FACE.
WITH COMMENTS LIKE GET AN AGENTIN TRAINING.
I WANT TO SEE YOU IN THE MOVIES.
AND HE SHOULD BE FREED ANDMODELING SOMEWHERE, YES HE COULD
BE MAKING A MEANINGFULCONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY LIKE
WALKING BACK AND FORTH ON ANELEVATED PLATFORM, LOOKING BORED
ABOUT HIS CAPE.
[LAUGHTER]AND THE INTERNET IS ALREADY
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR HISFUTURE CAREER BY PHOTOSHOPING
HIM INTO ADS FOR DOLCE &GABBANA, CALVIN KLEIN AND HUGO
BOSS, A TACTIC THAT SO FAR HASNOT WORKED FOR THOSE SEEKING THE

[LAUGHTER]FOLKS, THIS STORY, I GOT TO TELL
YOU, THIS MAN, THIS STORY GIVESME HOPE FOR AMERICA'S BROKEN
PRISON SYSTEM.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE YOUNGLIVES TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF
POVERTY, VIOLENCE ANDIMPRISONMENT, YOU START TO
REALIZE, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSETHEY'RE TOTAL UGGOS.
[LAUGHTER]FOR INSTANCE, LOOK AT THE
TRAGIC, LESS-THAN-HOTNESS OF THEMEN MEEKS WAS ARRESTED WITH.
SORRY, BUT NO ONE IS STARTING AFACEBOOK PAGE TITLED "FREE THESE
GUYS.
THEY'VE GOT A GREAT SENSE OFHUMOR."
JEREMY MEEKS PROVES THAT OURPRISONS DON'T NEED REFORM.
THEY NEED MAKEOVERS.
