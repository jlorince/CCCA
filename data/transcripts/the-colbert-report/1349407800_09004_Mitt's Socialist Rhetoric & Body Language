FOLKS, I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT ROMNEY CRUSHED IT.
BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WAS RIGHT IN HIS WHEELHOUSE.
SOUL-CRUSHING.
IN FACT, IT WAS SO TEDIOUS I THINK MAN IN THE FRONT ROW FELL ASLEEP.
(LAUGHTER) THE FIRST HALF HOUR, THE FIRST HALF HOUR, FOLKS.
(APPLAUSE) THE FIRST HALF HOUR WAS AN OR GEOOF TAX POLICY MINUTISH-- ORGY WAS TAX POLICY MINUTIA, AND THEY
MOVED ON TO THE INTRICACIES OF MEDICARE SOLVENCY IT WAS OFF THE HOOK, IN THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO A DIAL TONE.
(LAUGHTER) BUT HOWEVER WONKY IT GOT LAST NIGHT THERE WAS NO MISS TACKING THAT THERE WAS A FIRE BREATHING LEFTIE ON
THAT STAGE SPEWING HEATED SOCIALIST RHETORIC.
>> I WILL NOT REDUCE THE TAXES PAID BY HIGH INCOME AMERICANS.
REGULATION IS ESSENTIAL.
YOU CAN'T HAVE A FREE MARKET WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE REGULATION.
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS ARE COVERED UNDER MY PLAN.
AND WITH REGARDS TO HEALTH CARE WA, WE DID IN MASSACHUSETTS IS A MODEL FOR THE NATION, STATE-BY-STATE.
>> Stephen: YES, MITT ROMNEY'S HEALTH-CARE PLAN IS JUST LIKE HIS POSITIONS, THE DETAILS CHANGE STATE-BY-STATE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW-- FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME-- YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW ME.
AS A STANCH CONSERVATIVE I CONDEMN ANY HELP CAN WHO-- REPUBLICAN WHO DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
BUT IT WORKED SO [BLEEP] IT.
(LAUGHTER) BESIDES, I MEAN THE ARGUMENTS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ARGUMENTS, THE ARGUMENTS HARDLY MATTERED.
WHAT COUNTS IS BODY LANGUAGE, RIGHT MEGAN KELLY.
>> IT WAS AN INTERESTING DIMIC TO SEE MITT ROMNEY LOOKING MOSTLY OVER AT PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE WAS
MAKING HIS POINT.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA CHOOSING TO LOOK MOSTLY AT JIM LEHRER OR LOOKING DOWN.
AND WHAT MESSAGE DO THE VIEWERS AT HOME PICK UP ON THAT.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S BODY LANGUAGE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND THAT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WHICH WAS AN EXPRESSION,
THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE FOLLOW HIM WAS FAMILIAR W AS KIND OF A HALF SMILE, NOT A SMIRK-- .
>> Stephen: YES, BRIT, MITT HAD A CONFIDENT HALF SMILE, LIKE THIS.
(LAUGHTER) NOT A SMIRK LIKE THIS--  (LAUGHTER) AND DEFINITELY NOT A BIG BRIGHT RICK HUMAN SMILE LIKE
THIS-- HUME SMILE LIKE THIS (LAUGHTER) SO ULTIMATELY, FOLKS, CHOOSING THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD IS CLEARLY ALL
ABOUT HOW IT LOOKS.
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID NOT HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF TO WASTE LAST NIGHT, HERE'S HOW IT LOOKS.
>> WE WELCOME PRESIDENT OBAMA AND GOVERNOR ROMNEY.
(APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
