>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I HAVE HAD IT,
HAVE HAD IT WITH THE MEDIA ACCUSING THE REPUBLICANS OF WAGING A WAR ON WOMEN, ANDLY
PERSONALLY FIGHT ANY WOMAN WHO SAYS WE ARE.
LUCKILY RNC CHAIRMAN AND LATIN TERM FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DOES EXACTLY WHAT THIS SO-CALLED
WAR IS.
IT IS A LIBERAL FANTASY FANNED BY THE LAME-STREAM MEDIA.
>> THE DEMOCRATS SAID WE HAD A WAR ON CAT PILLARS AND EVERY MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLET TALKED
ABOUT THE FACT THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE WAR ON CATERPILLAR, THEN WE'D HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CATERPILLARS.
>> Stephen: NOW, TO BE CLEAR,
THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT FIGHTING A WAR ON CAT PILLARS.
THEY ARE SIMPLY CALLING FOR TRANSCOCOONAL ULTRA SOUNDS.
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THIS WAR ON WOMEN MYTH HAS TAKEN ROOT.
A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT LIKELY CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY TRAILS OBAMA AMONG WOMEN VOTERS BY 19 POINTS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, I AM NOT GOING TO STAND BY WHILE THIS FICTITIOUS WAR DRIVES WOMEN AWAY FROM THE G.O.P.,
WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT I AM INTRODUCING MY NEW SEGMENT -- NO, MAKE THAT MY NEW
SETTING-WOMENT, "STEPHEN COLBERT'S LADY HEROES." NOW, NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, LADY
HEROES ARE ALL MEN BECAUSE CONSERVATIVE MEN FEEL COMFORTABLE SPEAKING FOR WOMEN.
THEY UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A UTER-U.
IT'S A UTER-US.
THEY LOVE IT HERE.
[APPLAUSE]
LADY NATION, TONIGHT'S LADY HERO HAILS FROM WISCONSIN WHERE EMBATTLED GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER
HAS JUST REPEALED THE STATE'S EQUAL PAY ENFORCEMENT ACT WHICH ALLOWS LEGAL RECOURSE FOR WOMEN
WHO HAVE BEEN PAID LESS FOR EQUAL WORK.
HOT TIP: IF YOU ARE GOING TO SUE YOUR EMPLOYER FOR UNEQUAL PAY,
HIRE A LADY LAWYER.
IT'S MUCH CHEAPER.
BUT WALKER IS NOT TONIGHT'S LADY HERO.
NO, THAT HONOR GOES TO THE MAN WHO LED THE REPEAL OF THE EQUAL PAY ACT, WISCONSIN STATE SENATOR
GLEN GROTHMAN WHO KNOWS THAT WAGE DISCRIMINATION IS JUST A MILLION.
TAKE A HYPOTHETICAL HUSBAND AND WIFE WHO ARE BOTH LAWYERS.
THE WOMAN TAKES TIME OFF, RAISES KIDS, IS NOT GO, GO, GO.
THE HUSBAND IS MAKING $200,000 A YEAR.
THE WOMAN IS MAKING $40,000 A YEAR.
IT WASN'T DISCRIMINATION.
THERE WAS A DIFFERENT SENSE OF URGENCY IN EACH PERSON.
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT MONEY IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR MEN.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
EXACTLY.
WOMEN DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE THEY CASH THEIR PAYCHECKS.
BESIDES, GOOD LUCK EVEN FINDING THEM IN THOSE HANDBAG, AM I RIGHT, FELLAS?
YOU SEE, GROTHMAN UNDERSTANDS THAT MONEY IS A GUY THING, LIKE FOOTBALL OR BUFFALO WINGS OR
DECIDING WHAT IS FAIR COMPENSATION FOR WOMEN.
BESIDES, US DUDES NEED THE CASH TO IMPRESS THE LADIES.
THEY HAVE WAY LESS MONEY FOR SOME REASON.
[LAUGHTER]
SO BRAVO TO THIS MONTH'S LADY HERO, GLEN GRATHMAN.
I CAN'T
