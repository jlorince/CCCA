I HOPE... I HOPE THAT WAS
FROSTING.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, THERE IS NOTHING... CALM
DOWN.
NATION, THERE IS NOTHING I LOVE
MORE THAN A GOOD MONOMENT.
FROM MT. RUSHMORE TO THE SPACE
NEEDLE TO EGYPT'S STIRRING
TRIBUTE TO THE LUXOR HOTEL &
CASINO IN VEGAS, OR RECENTLY A
IMPORTANT NEW MEMORIAL WAS
UNVEILED ON THE NATIONAL MALL
HONORING THE REVEREND SIR
DR. MILK , JR.
HE'S NOT ONLY BEEN TO THE
MOUNTAINTOP, HE'S BEEN GLUED TO
IT.
AND I AM AN, PERT ON ALL THINGS
MLK BECAUSE I WAS AT HIS "I HAVE
A DREAM" SPEECH INSIDE MY
PREGNANT MOTHER WHO ATTENDED.
I HAVE THIS PENNANT, OKAY, FROM
THE DAY TO PROVE IT.
I COULD NOT BE JUDGED BY THE
COLOR OF MY SKIN BECAUSE AT THE
TIME I WAS TECHNICALLY
TRANSLEWIS NT.
BUT FOLKS, I WAS CONAN O'BRIEN
COLOR.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
AS WE KNOW... SEE YOU AT THE
EMMYS, RED.
BUT THERE IS SOME CONTROVERSY
AROUND THIS MEMORIAL, FOLKS, AND
NOT JUST BECAUSE THE SCULPTURE
MISTAKENLY MADE HIM WHITE.
NO.
IT IS OVER A QUOTATION FROM
DR. KING INSCIEBED ON THE
MEMORIAL.
LET'S HEAR IT FROM THE MAN
ITSELF.
>> YES, IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT
I WAS A DRUM MAJOR, SAY THAT I
WAS A DRUM MAJOR FOR JUSTICE.
SAY THAT I WAS A DRUM MAJOR FOR
PEACE.
I WAS A DRUM MAJOR FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS.
>> Stephen: STIRRING.
HUMBLE.
AND IF WE'RE BEING BRUTALLY
HONEST, A LITTLE WORDY.
WHICH IS WHY ON THE MONOMENT THE
QUOTE WAS PARAPHRASED SO THAT IT
WOULD FIT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF
THE STATUE.
IT NOW READS, "I WAS A DRUM
MAJOR FOR JUSTICE, PEACE AND
RIGHTEOUSNESS."
BOOM.
SHORT, PITHY, TO THE POINT, NOT
DR. KING'S POINT, BUT STILL.
YOU NOW WHAT THEY SAY, BREVITY
IS THE SOUL OF SAVING MONEY ON
CHISELING FEES.
BUT SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE DON'T
APPRECIATE DR. KING GETTING THE
READER'S DIGEST TREATMENT.
CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND
WALKING GRAVITAS GEYSER MAYA
ANGELOU SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE
REWARDING SAYING, "THE QUOTE
MAKES DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING
LOOK LIKE AN ARROGANT TWIT.
HE WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT.
HE WAS FAR TOO PROFOUND A MAN
FOR THAT FOUR-LETTER WORD TO
APPLY."
OR AS SHE'LL ONE DAY BE
PARAPHRASED, DR. MARTIN LUTHER
KING, AN AR GANTD TWIT, HE WAS A
FOUR-LETTER WORD.
SO EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY PLEASE
JUST CALM DOWN.
THIS IS A MEMORIAL.
IT'S ABOUT HOW WE REMEMBER
DR. KING, NO MATTER WHAT HE MAY
HAVE ACTUALLY SAID.
I KNOW MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
DR. KING QUOTE HAS ALWAYS BEEN,
"WHO YOU GOING TO CALL,
GHOSTBUSTERS."
IF ANYTHING, IF ANYTHING, FOLKS,
MEMORIAL ARCHITECT ED JACKSON
STILL LEFT THE QUOTE A LITTLE
TOO LONG.
I SAY TRIM THE FAT DOWN TO, "I
WAS A DRUM MAJOR."
YOU CAN EVEN ADD ONE OF THOSE
FANCY HATS.
HEY, HEY, HE DID LEAD A MARCH.
