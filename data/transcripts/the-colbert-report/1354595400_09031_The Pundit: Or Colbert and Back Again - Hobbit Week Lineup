>> Stephen: WELL COME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US, LADY ITS AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING ELLEN SILLA LUMEN OMENTIELVO.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I SLIPPED IN A LITTLE QUENYA THERE, I'M JUST SO PUMPED ABOUT THE NEW
HOBBIT MOVIE ABOUT THAT HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT.
HOBBIT, HOBBIT, HOBBIT.
YOU EVER SAY A WORD SO PAIN TIMES IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY JUST MADE IT UP?
ANYWAY, THIS THURSDAY IS THE NEW YORK PREMIER OF PETER JACKSON'S J.R.R. TOLKIEN THE
HOBBIT PART ONE, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, TOKYO DRIFT.
(LAUGHTER) AND THIS WEEK WE GOT ALL THE BIG STARS.
SIR IAN McKELLEN, GANDALF THE GREY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE GOT SIR MARTIN FREEMAN, BILBO BAGGINS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIR PETER JACKSON WHO PLAYED A VERY CONVINCING FILM DIRECTOR.
AND SIR ANDY SERKIS WHO IS EITHER THE MAN WHO PLAYED CAESAR IN RISE OF THE PLANET
OF THE APRILS OR HE IS A SUPERCHIMP WHO PLAYS THIS MAN.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND WE HAVE GOT FOR YOUR PLEASURE WE'VE GOT AN EVEN BIGGER TOLKIEN NAME LINED UP
TO HOST OUR HOBBIT WEEK, ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AS PETER JACKSON HIMSELF SAID OF ME IN ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, QUOTE, I HAVE NEVER
MET A BIGGER TOLKIEN GEEK IN MY LIFE.
YOU HEAR THAT?
YOU HEAR THAT GIRLS FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL?
I'M NOT A GEEK.
I'M KING GEEK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU JUST, BUD HEEE JUST HANDLING THERE FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS.
YOU WANT A PAYOFF?
OF COURSE ONCE IT GOT OUT ON THE INTERNET THAT I HAD VISITED THE SET OF THE HOBBIT NEW ZEALAND LAST YEAR
IT TOUCHED OFF A FIRESTORM IN THE MEDIA ABOUT MY POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN THE MOVIE.
STARTED WITH THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE UPON TER'S INNOCENT QUESTION, WILL STEPHEN COLBERT APPEAR IN THE HOBBIT?
FOLLOWED BY "THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER" AS STEPHEN COLBERT TO MAKE CAMEO IN THE HOBBIT.
AND THEN THE BOMBSHELL EXAMINER HEADLINE, THE HOBBIT MOVIE NEWS STEPHEN COLBERT TO STAR IN LORD OF
THE RINGS PREQUEL.
I HAVE TO SAY-- I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS AN EXCITING AND UNVERIFIED ESCALATION OF MY CAREER.
BUT IS ANY OF IT TRUE?
WELL, MY LIPS ARE SEALED.
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS: IF I DID NOT APPEAR IN THE HOBBIT TRILOGY, WHY DO I HAVE THE ELVISH BLADE STRING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ONE OF THE ORIGINAL STINGS USED IN THE LORD OF THE RING THE TRILOGY, WHERE DID I GET
T FIND IT IN A MOUNTAIN TROLL CAVE OR IS IT JUST SOME PROP.
OH NO, THIS WAS MADE IN GONDOLIN BEFORE THE FALL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
