EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
NEUROSCIENTIST HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THE NEUROLOGICAL
UNDERPINNINGS OF THE
SUBCONSCIOUS, IF THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS THE SUBCONSCIOUS.
PLEASE MOMMY BREAST DAVID
EAGLEMAN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
, HI, DAVID EAGLEMAN.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE A
NEUROSCIENTIST.
WHAT IS A NEUROSCIENTIST FOR A
GOOD FOLKS?
>> WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE
BRAIN WORKS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: DOES IT ALWAYS
WORK?
>> IT'S ALWAYS DOING STUFF UNDER
THE HOOD THAT YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT IS THE THING.
IT'S ALWAYS SCREAMING ALONG WITH
ACTIVITY IN WAYS THAT YOUR
CONSCIOUS MIND DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
ACCESS TO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU WORK ON TIME PERCEPTION,
NEURAL LAW, AND YOU HAVE A NEW
BOOK CALLED "INCOGNITO: THE
SECRET LIVES OF THE BRAIN."
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SECRET LIVES
OF THE BRAIN"?
>> WELL, THE BRAIN IS THE MOST
COMPLICATED THING WE'VE EVER
FOUND IN THE UNIVERSE.
IT CONSISTS OF HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF NEURONS CONNECTED IN
SUCH COMPLEXITY THAT A CUBIC
MILLIMETER OF BRAIN TISSUE AS
MANY CONNECTIONS AS THERE ARE
STARS IN THE MILKY WAY GALAXY.
>> Stephen: BULL [BLEEPED].
>> IT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
REALLY?
A CUBIC MILLIMETER?
>> YES.
SO THE REALLY AMAZING PART IS
THAT THE BRAIN IS RUNNING ALL OF
ITS OPERATIONS, ALMOST ALL OF IT
UNDER THE HOOD OF CONSCIOUS
AWARENESS.
SO THESE MASSIVE THINGS ARE
GOING ON, AND YOU DON'T KNOW,
THE THINGS YOU ACT... THE THINGS
YOU BELIEVE, THE THINGS YOU
THINK, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY
COME FROM.
THEY GET GENERATED UNDER THE
SURFACE AND SERVED UP TO YOUR
CONSCIOUS BRAIN, AND YOU SAY,
HEY, I JUST THOUGHT OF
SOMETHING.
BUT IT WASN'T YOU THAT THOUGHT
OF IT.
YOUR BRAIN HAS BEEN WORKING ON
IT FOR DAYS OR WEEKS.
>> Stephen: WAIT.
THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE IN MY
HEAD?
AM I JUST LIKE A VEHICLE FOR MY
BRAIN TO GO AROUND?
>> AS PINK FLOYD SAID, "THERE'S
SOMEONE IN MY HEAD, BUT IT'S NOT
ME."
IT'S ESSENTIALLY THAT SITUATION.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU HIGH?
[APPLAUSE]
BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HEARD... I
NEVER HEARD... I HAVE NEVER
HEARD ANYONE OUTSIDE OF A
COLLEGE DORM ROOM QUOTE PINK
FLOYD, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> GLAD TO BE THE FIRST.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
DO YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR
BRAIN IS DOING, BECAUSE MY BRAIN
TELLS ME THING ALL THE TIME AND
I JUST IGNORE IT.
>> RIGHT.
YOUR BRAIN IS LIKE THE C.E.O. OF
A COMPANY, WHICH ONLY HAS ACCESS
TO MAYBE THE LONG-TERM VISION OF
THE COMPANY AND DOESN'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND ALL THE MACHINERY OF
THE COMPANY BENEATH IT.
SO THE C.E.O. SETS THE LONG-TERM
VISION, BUT THE OPERATIONS THAT
MAKE IT ALL WORK, YOU DON'T
REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT
UNIONIZED, IS IT?
THE C.E.O. IS MAKING 100 TIMES
WHAT THE GUY ON THE ASSEMBLY
LINE IS MAKING, ISN'T HE?
>> THAT'S THE FUNNY PART ABOUT
OUR CONSCIOUS LIVES, THE
CONSCIOUS YOU, THE PART THAT
FLICKERS TO LIFE WHEN YOU WAKE
UP IN THE MORNING, THAT'S THE
SMALLEST BIT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN YOUR BRAIN.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS IN
DREAMS?
IS THAT REAL?
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE TO MY
BRAIN WHETHER OR NOT I REALLY DO
THINGS?
LET'S SAY I AM NAKED HORSE BACK
RIDING AND LIKE THERE'S WOMEN
RUBBING ME WITH SCENTED OILS AND
THEN I RIDE UP TO A HUGE CROWD
ON A SPANISH HILLTOP AND
EVERYONE CHEERS MY NAME AND THEN
I PLAY A GAME OF CHESS WITH
HUMAN FIGURES.
OKAY.
NOW IF LATER THAT NIGHT I DREAM
THAT I DO THAT, IS THAT AS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IS THAT AS POWERFUL IN A DREAM?
DOES IT MATTER WHETHER IT'S REAL
OR DREAM STATE FOR THE EFFECT ON
MY PSYCHE?
>> YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS WHAT
DREAMS SHOW US IS THAT WE CAN BE
FOOLED INTO BELIEVING TERRORIST
REALITIES.
AND SO IT'S TAKEN AS A REAL
HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS MIGHT BE A
SIMULATION.
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT WE CAN BE
FOOLED INTO COMPLETELY BUYING
SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: WAITED A SECOND.
IS THIS "INCEPTION"?
ARE YOU AND I... ARE YOUDY
DICAPRIO?
>> DID YOU BRING THE TOP?
>> Stephen: [BLEEPED] I LOST
IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
AT THE END DO YOU THINK HE'S
STILL DREAMING?
>> YEAH, YEAH, PROBABLY.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK HE'S
STILL DREAMING?
>> THIS WHOLE THING MIGHT BE A
CIVILIZATION, TWO BILLION MORE
ADVANCED THAN WE ARE AND THEY'RE
RECREATING 2011.
>> Stephen: HOW CAN WE FIGURE
OUT WHETHER THAT'S TRUE?
>> GOT TO WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE AND
WAKE UP PROBABLY.
BACK TO THE BOOK.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> NONE OF THAT IS IN THE BOOK.
THE BOOK IS ABOUT ALL THESE
UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES ON HOW WE
MAKE DECISIONS IN OUR LIVES.
>> Stephen: YOU HAD TO THINK
OF TEAM OF RIVALS THEORY.
WHAT IS THAT?
>> IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE NOT ONE
THING.
YOUR BRAIN IS MAKE UP OF LOTS OF
COMPETING SUBPOPULATIONS.
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN
LIKE A NEURAL PARLIAMENT WITH
DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES
BATTLING IT OUT THE STEER THE
SHIP OF STATE.
>> Stephen: REALLY,
PARLIAMENT?
ARE YOU SAYING MY BRAIN IS
BRITISH?
BECAUSE THAT WAS... I NEED A
REASON TO EXPLAIN WHY I DRIVE ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD
SOMETIMES.
[LAUGHTER]
SO IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT
POLITICAL PARTIES IN MY HEAD
BATTLING FOR CONTROL, WHO WANTS
TO RAISE MY EMOTIONAL DEBT
CEILING?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DAVID EAGLEMAN, THE BOOK IS
