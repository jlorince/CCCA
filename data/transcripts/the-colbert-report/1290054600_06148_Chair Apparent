NATION, FOLKS, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES IS CHANGING
HANDS.
THAT MEANS MORE THAN JUST THE
DEMOCRATS GIVING THE REPUBLICANS
A KEYS AND EXPLAINING WHICH
REMOTE WORKS THE TV AND WHICH
SHUTS DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
IT MEANS ALL THE HOUSE
COMMITTEES GET NEW REPUBLICAN
CHAIRMAN, AND I CANNOT WAIT.
IT WILL BE LIKE CHRISTMAS
MORNING EXCEPT EVERY PRESENT IS
AN OLD WHITE GUY.
( LAUGHTER )
AND WITH ALL THE NEW VACANCIES,
IT'S TIME FOR THE LATEST
INSTALLMENT OF MY LONG-RUNNING
SERIES "STEPHEN COLBERT'S CHAIR
APPARENT."
TONIGHT, TONIGHT THE BATTLE TO
CHAIR THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE.
NOW, THE POSERS OUT THERE CAN
TALK ABOUT YOUR UPON AND YOUR
STERN, BUT THIS THING COMES DOWN
TO A SLUGFEST BETWEEN TWO GREAT
CONSERVATIVES, JOE BARTON OF
TEXAS AND JOHN SHIMKAS OF
ILLINOIS.
BARTON LOOKS STRONG.
HE'S THE HOUSE'S LEADING EXPERT
ON ENERGY, AND BY EXPERT, I MEAN
THE GUY WHO ALWAYS GETS THE MOST
CASH FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY.
THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE LED
BARTON THE STAND UP TO BRITISH
PETROLEUM ON HIS OWN TWO KNEES.
>> IT IS A TRAGEDY OF THE FIRST
PROPORTION THAT A PRIVATE
CORPORATION CAN BE SUBJECTED TO
WHAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS A
SHAKEDOWN.
I APOLOGIZE.
>> Stephen: YES, HE BLEW SMOKE
UP TONY HAYWARD'S ASS.
BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW HE
BECAME AN EXPERT ON WIND ENERGY.
LISTEN, LISTEN TO HIS ANALYSIS
OF THIS SQUAD RENEWABLE SOURCE.
WIND IS GOD'S WAY OF BALANCING
HEAT.
WIND IS THE WAY YOU SHIFT HEAT
FROM AREAS WHERE IT'S HOTTER TO
AREAS WHERE IT'S COOLER.
THAT'S WHAT WIND IS.
WOULDN'T IT BE IRONIC IF IN THE
INTEREST OF GLOBAL WARMING WE
MANDATED MASSIVE SWITCHES TO
ENERGY, WHICH IS A FINITE
RESOURCE, WHICH SLOWS THE WINDS
DOWN, WHICH CAUSES THE
TEMPERATURES TO GO UP?
( LAUGHTER )
THAT IS RIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS... HE'S RIGHT.
WIND TURBINES WILL MAKE THE WIND
SLOW DOWN.
IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR
HAND OUT THE CAR WINDOW, THE CAR
STOPS.
THAT'S CALLED SCIENCE.
AND SCIENCE IS SOMETHING BARTON
UNDERSTANDS WELL BECAUSE HE
BAFFLED NOBEL PRIZE WINNING
ENERGY SECRETARY STEVEN CHU.
>> I HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION
FOR YOU IN THE LAST SIX SECONDS:
HOW DID ALL THE OIL AND GAS GET
TO ALASKA AND UNDER THE ARCTIC
OCEAN?
>> THIS IS A COMPLICATED STORY.
THERE ARE CONTINENTAL PLATES
THAT HAVE BEEN DRIFTING AROUND
THROUGHOUT THE GEOLOGICAL AGES.
>> SO IT JUST DRIFTED UP THERE?
>> Stephen: YEAH, CHU, REALLY.
IT JUST DRIFTED UP THERE.
AS IF THE CONTINENTS WERE
WRAPPED OF ROCK FLOATING ON A
MOLTEN CORE WHICH ALSO EXPLAINS
ALL VOLCANIC ACTIVITY AND
EARTHQUAKES.
RIGHT.
ISN'T THE SIMPLER, BLAH NATION
THAT DURING THE MISSING 18 YEARS
OF JESUS' LIFE THAT AREN'T IN
THE BIBLE THAT HE WENT UP TO
ALASKA AND GAVE IT A DELICIOUS
FUDGY CENTER?
SO CLEARLY JOE BARTON WOULD BE
THE PERFECT MAN FOR THE JOB WERE
IT NOT FOR ILLINOIS'S JOHN
SHIMKAS WHO KNOWS WE DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING
BECAUSE GOD TOLD NOAH HE
WOULDN'T FLOOD THE WORLD AGAIN,
AND IF A GUY STUCK ON A BOAT
WITH THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS DIDN'T
COMPLAIN ABOUT METHANE
EMISSIONS, WHY SHOULD WE?
CONGRESSMAN...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT GUY LOOKS REALLY FAMILIAR.
( LAUGHTER )
CONGRESSMAN SHIMKAS TESTIFIED.
>> I WANT TO START WITH GENESIS
8.
"NEVER AGAIN WILL I DESTROY ALL
LIVING CREATURES AS I HAVE DONE.
AS LONG AS THE EARTH ENDURES,
HARVEST, COLD AND HEAT, SUMMER
AND WINTER, DAY AND NIGHT WILL
NEVER CEASE."
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE WORD OF GOD
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO
BE FOR HIS CREATIONS.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
THE BIBLE SHOULD BE OUR GUIDE
FOR ANY CRISIS.
THAT'S WHY WHENEVER I SEE A
MUGGING VICTIM LYING IN A DITCH,
I KNOW THE BEST MEDICAL
TREATMENT IS TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE
FROM SUE MARA TO HELP HIM.
POINT IS, POINT IS, MANKIND
CANNOT DESTROY THE EARTH.
THE BOOK OF THE REVELATION
CLEARLY LAYS OUT EXACTLY WHAT
WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE EARTH ENDS
AND IT NEVER MENTIONS
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS.
IT JUST SAYS THE TREES AND GAS
WILL BIRD, ONE-THIRD OF THE
CREATURES IN THE SEA WILL DRY,
SMOKE WILL RISE FROM THE ABYSS
LIKE A SMOKE FROM THE GIGANTIC
FURNACE DARKNING THE SUN.
NOTHING ABOUT CAP AND TRADE IN
THERE.
THAT IS WHY REPRESENTATIVE
SHIMKAS IS GETTING THE COLBERT
BUMP.
SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN
CHARGE, AND WHEN YOU DO GET YOUR
CHAIRMANSHIP, PLEASE INVITE ME
TO ALL YOUR HEARINGS, BECAUSE I
WOULD LOVE TO TESTIFY AGAIN AS
LONG AS I CAN BRING MY
