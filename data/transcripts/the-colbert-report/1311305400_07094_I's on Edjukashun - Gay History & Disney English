NATION, THIS IS MY QUESTION: YOU
ARE ALL MY STUDENTS, AND I AM
HOT FOR TEACHER.
THIS IS "EYES ON EDUCATION."

FIRST PERIOD.
[BELL RINGS]
HISTORY.
FOLKS, OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE
FILLED WITH VIOLENCE, DRUGS AND
GUNS.
BUT THEY ARE ABOUT TO GET
DANGEROUS.
>> CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR HAS
SIGNED A BILL THAT REQUIRES
SCHOOLS TO TEACH GAY HISTORY.
>> THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
BRINGING GAY HISTORY INTO OUR
CLASSROOM TEACHES OUR CHILDREN A
DANGEROUS LESSON, THAT GAY
PEOPLE EXIST.
[LAUGHTER]
AND STRAIGHT NATION, IT ONLY
GETS WORSE.
>> LESSONS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
WILL NOW INCLUDE THE
CONTRIBUTIONS OF LESBIAN, GAY,
BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER
AMERICANS.
>> TRANSGENDER AMERICANS?
GREAT.
NOW OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO LEARN
ABOUT HOW FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT
BECAME ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.
BUT THAT WON'T BE THE ONLY
REVELATION IN THESE
TEACHER-TAUGHT LESSON
PLAN-ON-MAN ACTION.
>> STARTING IN 2013, STUDENTS
WILL LEARN ABOUT FAMOUS GAY
PEOPLE, IS UP AS HARVEY MILK,
SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST OPENLY GAY
POLITICIAN.
>> IF, IN FACT, THERE IS A
DISCUSSION IN ENGLISH ABOUT
OSCAR WILDE, IT WILL REFERENCE
THE FACT THAT HE WAS GAY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
THIS GUY WAS GAY?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING I NEVER
LEARNED ABOUT HIM.
AND, FOLKS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
SEES WHERE THIS THING IS GOING.
>> CALIFORNIA REWRITING THE TEXT
BOOKS, THE HISTORY BOOKS SAYING,
BY THE WAY, GEORGE WASHINGTON
WAS A HOMOSEXUAL.
>> YES, HOW DARE CALIFORNIA SAY
THAT A MAN IN A POWDERED WIG AND
HIGH SILK STOCKINGS IS GAY.
NEXT THING THEY'LL ACCUSE HIM OF
CROSSING THE DELAWARE ON A PRIDE
FLOAT.
WELL, CALIFORNIA, CALIFORNIA,
YOU'RE SO EAGER FOR GAY HISTORY,
I WILL GIVE YOU GAY HISTORY.
GAY WAS INVENTED IN ANCIENT
GREECE BY SOCRATES, WHO CAME UP
WITH THE SOCRATIC METHOD, WHICH
I BELIEVE IS A GAY SEX MOVE.
IN THE FIFTH CENTURY, THE
VISIGOTHS SPREAD THEIR GAY
CULTURE OF PANTSLESSNESS
THROUGHOUT EUROPE.
SEE THIS GUY SWINGING IN THE
BREEZE HERE?
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED
THE SAC OF ROME.
THEN IN 1504, AN ANGRY AND
DEPRESSED MICHELANGELO SCULPTS
HIS EX-BOYFRIEND DAVE, GIVING
HIM ROCK HARD ABS BUT IN A
BITCHY AND VENGEFUL MOVE GIVES
HIM AN INCREDIBLY SMALL CANNOLI.
THEN AFTER THAT NOTHING GAY FOR
500 YEARS.
STRAIGHTS WERE ON A ROLE UNTIL
THE '70s WHEN GAY MADE A
COMEBACK WHEN PAUL LYNN WAS
GIVEN THE CENTER SQUARE.
IMPRESSIONABLE CHILDREN HOMESICK
FROM SCHOOL WATCHED HIM, WERE
CONVERTED, AND BOOM, EVER SINCE
IT'S BEEN GAY, GAY, GAY, GAY,
GAY, THUS ENDETH THE LESSON,
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR FIRST POP
QUIZ: IF A SOCIETY BEGINS
TEACHING ITS CHILDREN ABOUT GAY
HISTORY IN 2011, HOW LONG UNTIL
THEY ALL BECOME GAY AND A GREAT
COUNTRY CRUMBLES INTO DUST?
A, INSTANTLY.
B, ALL OF THE ABOVE.
SECOND PERIOD.
[BELL RINGS]
SOCIAL STUDIES.
NATION, I DON'T KEEP AN EYE JUST
ON EDUCATION IN AMERICA.
I ALSO WATCH WHAT THEY'RE DOING
IN CHINA.
SOMEONE NEEDS TO TEACH THOSE
KIDS BETTER PENMANSHIP.
I'M GOING TO SAY "L," A VERY
LAZY "T."
WHATEVER.
WELL, CHINA IS EXPLORING A NEW
FRONTIER IN EDUCATION WITH THE
HELP OF THE HAPPIEST COMPANY ON
EARTH.
>> A NEW CAST OF ENGLISH
TEACHERS HAS COME SHANGHAI, AND
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THE GROUP IS
UNLIKE ANY INSTRUCTORS THIS
CITY'S CHILDREN HAS SEEN BEFORE.
THIS IS THE DISNEY ENGLISH
SCHOOL FIRST, OF MANY PLANNED
FOR CHINA.
IT'S THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY'S
NEWEST FORWAY INTO THE WORLD'S
MOST POPULOUS NATION.
>> STEPHEN: THE DISNEY ENGLISH
SCHOOL, NOW CHINESE KIDS LEARN
WORDS LIKE "MICKY" AND "MOUSE"
AND "SEW THAT MICKEY MOUSE
HOODIE FASTER" AND FUTURE
CLASSES CAN COVER MORE ADVANCED
CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH LIKE "ZIP
DEE DUE DAH" AND "SUPERCAL
TRAGIC."
OF COURSE, SOME SAY THEY'RE
BRAINWASHING THESE CHILDREN AS
POTENTIAL CLIENTS.
EXACTLY.
GOT TO GET THEM YOUNG.
FOLKS, WE NEED DISNEY ENGLISH
SCHOOLS HERE IN AMERICA.
WE CANNOT ALLOW A PRINCESS GAP.
AMERICAN KIDS ARE DANGEROUSLY
UNDEREXPOSED TO DISNEY
MARKETING.
THEY HAVE ONLY MOVIE, TOYS,
THEME PARKS, TV SHOWS, ICE
SPECTACULARS, BROADWAY SHOWS,
NIGHT LIGHTS AND TOY STORY
CREDIT CARDS.
KIDS, YOU CAN BE IN DEBT TO
INFINITY AND BEYOND.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
