WHEN I WAS A KID THIS WAS ADREAM CAR.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT?
AND THAT IS THE MUSTANG.
THAT SOUND RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
I WILL GET AN ERECTION.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, THIS IS ONE OF THE COOLESTCARS EVER MADE.
AND NOT ONLY WAS IT SORT OF COOLTO SEE ON THE STREET BUT IT WAS
IN THE MOVIES.
THIS IS WHAT STEVE MCQUEEN DROVEIN BULLET.
WHY DO YOU THINK SOME CARSBECOME ICONS AND SOME CARS DO
NOT?
>> WELL, I THINK, IN THIS CASE,THE MUSTANG JUST CHANGED THE
WORLD IN 1965, BECAUSE IT WASTHE FIRST REAL SPORTS CAR THAT
ALSO WAS A HIGH UTILITY, BECAUSEIT HAD TWO SEATS IN THE BACK, IT
HAS HAD A TRUNK.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE IT HADTWO SEATS IN THE BACK.
IT WAS A MUSTANG.
THE REASON IT BECAME AN ICON ISBECAUSE IT GOT YOU LAID.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T
TAKEN THAT OUT OF THE DESIGN.
>> NO, NO.
IT IS STILL VERY MUCHAPPRECIATED.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
GOOD.
NOW, WHEN WAS IT INTRODUCED?
>> IT WAS INTRODUCED IN 1965 ATTHE WORLD'S FAIR RIGHT HERE IN
NEW YORK CITY.
>> Stephen: IN SUPPORT OF THATYOU ARE INTRODUCING A NEW 50TH
ANNIVERSARY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: OF -- THERE IS THE20 -- THIS IS THE 2015 MUSTANG.
UH WOW.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: MY QUESTION IS,
THOUGH YOU STILL KNOW IT IS2013, RIGHT?  AND YET WE ARE
LOOKING AT THE 2015 MUSTANG.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I ASSUME YOU HAVECOME HERE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT IN
THE 2028 FORD TIME MACHINE.
DOES IT HAVE A JET PACK?
>> THAT IS THE FUTURE.
THAT IS THE FUTURE, YES.
>> Stephen: WE SHOULD HOPE SO.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: NOW, SPEAKING OFCARS OF THE FUTURE, YOU GUYS,
LET'S TALK ABOUT CARS OF THEPAST AND CAR COMPANIES OF THE
PAST.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE BACK INTHE OLD AUTO BAILOUT YOU ARE THE
ONLY ZERO COMPANY THAT DIDN'TTAKE A BAILOUT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: GM AND CHRYSLERHAD TO BE BAILED OUT.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT FORD AND ONE OFTHE REASONS I LIKE YOU GUYS IS
THAT YOU ARE CAPITALISTS UNLIKETHOSE BOLSHEVIKS OVER AT GM AND
CHRYSLER.
COMRADE!  WHAT DO YOU THINK OFTHOSE GUYS SUCKING ON THE
GOVERNMENT TEAT?
>> ISN'T IT BETTER FOR THEM TOBE WHIPPED OUT OF THE GENE POOL?
>> WELL, STEPHEN, CLEARLY THEUNITED STATES WAS IN A VERY,
VERY TENUOUS SITUATION, SO EVENTHOUGH WE BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM
WE ACTUALLY WENT AND TESTIFIEDON BEHALF OF OUR BANKRUPT
COMPETITORS, I THINK WE DID THERIGHT THING FOR THE ECONOMY AND
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ATTHE TIME.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT DETROIT
NOW?  HOW DO WE SAVE DETROIT?
>> I WOULD SAY.
>> Stephen: THEY JUST DECLAREDBANKRUPTCY?  HOW DO YOU PAY OFF
THAT DEBT?  YOU ARE STILL INMICHIGAN.
>> DEARBORN.
>> TEN, 20 MILES FROM DETROIT? WHAT DO WE DO?  DO WE PAY OFF
THE DEBT BY JUST PULLING THEGOLD FROM THE PENSIONERS OR DO
WE JUST LET THE GREAT MOATRECLAIM DEDETROIT?  WHAT DO WE
DO?
>> I THINK THEY ARE DOING THERIGHT THING AND ADDRESSING ALL
OF THE AREAS OF CONCERN,EVERYBODY HAS TO PULL TOGETHER
AND DEVELOP A BETTER PLAN.
THE THING ABOUT FORD, THOUGH,STEPHEN IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE
ARE NOT INSIDE DETROIT ITSELF WEARE VERY CLOSE AS YOU SAID AND
ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE THERE,OUR SUPPLIERS ARE THERE AND
BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF OURPRODUCTS WE ARE ACTUALLY GROWING
PROFITABLY AND HIRING 15,000 NEWEMPLOYEES, WHICH IS THE BEST WE
CAN DO TO HELP DETROIT.
>> Stephen: NOT UNION, THOUGH,YOU ARE NOT HIRING UNION, ARE
YOU?
>> YES A LOT ARE REPRESENTED BYUNION.
>> UNIONS ARE WHAT AREDESTROYING AMERICA DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT?  IT IS IN THEUNION CHARTER, DESTROY AMERICA.
DENTAL COVERAGE AND DESTROYAMERICA.
>> WELL, AS YOU WELL KNOW,UNIONS SIGNED THESE AGREEMENTS
OVER THE YEARS AND WE ENDED UPNOT BEING COMPETITIVE IN FORD'S
CASE WE WORKED TOGETHER ANDWANTED TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE I
HAVE AND COMPETE WITH THE BESTIN THE WORLD SO WE REDID ALL THE
AGREEMENTS AND THAT'S WHY WE AREBRINGING PRODUCT BACK TO THE
UNITED STATES AND COMPETING WITHTHE BEST IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH THENEW ROLLOUT.
I LOVE IT.
