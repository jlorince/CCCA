SO TO HELP LEARN WHETHER
SEXUAL ADVANCES ARE WELCOME
OR UNWELCOME LET'S HEAD OVER
TO THE GRAB ASK 5800.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE GRAB ASK 5800
WHICH-- FOR PURPOSE OF THIS
DEMONSTRATION, IS A DON'T
TOUCH-SCREEN.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I WILL NOT TOUCH THE
DON'T TOUCH-SCREEN BECAUSE I
HAVE NOT BEEN INVITED TO.
EVEN THOUGH, LET'S FACE IT,
IT'S CLEARLY ASKING FOR IT I
MEAN--
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN COME ON P AM I CRAZY.
AM I THE ONLY ONE GETTING A
VIBE HERE.
I MEANS WHAT'S UP, SCREEN?
OKAY.
SEE?
THAT'S OUR FIRST LESSON.
I MEAN I CLEARLY
MISINTERPRETED THE SCREEN'S
INTENTIONS.
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FIRST,
TOUCH-SCREEN, MAY I PUT MY
HANDS ON YOU?
OKAY, GREAT.
NOW SI HAVE A LOT OF
SYMPATHY FOR BOB FILLNER
BECAUSE THE SEXUAL RULES OF
THE MODERN WORKPLACE ARE A
BYZANTINE MAZE OF CAPRICIOUS
NUANCE.
FOR INSTANCE, LET'S SAY YOU
FEEL THE DESIRE TO TONGUE
YOUR COWORKER'S FACE DURING
A MEETING.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT DO DOW?
NOT SO SIMPLE, IS IT?
THAT'S WHY I HAVE DEVISED A
FOOLPROOF SYSTEM I CALLED
DON'T, OKAY.
IT'S A HANDY KNEW MONDAYIC
DEVICE.
THE D STANDS FOR DON'T.
(LAUGHTER)
AND--
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND THE REST OF THE LETTERS
ARE JUST A BONUS.
YOU DON'T NEED THOSE.
THOSE CAN GO.
OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
THE NEXT TIME, THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE WITH A COWORKER AND
YOU'RE THINKING I WANT TO
ASK HER NOT TO WEAR PANTIES
WHILE PUTTING HER IN A HEAD
LOCK AND GROWNING HER-- GROPING
HER BOO B'S, STOP, REASSESS,
APPLY THE SYSTEM AND DON'T.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT?
FOLKS, JUST STICK TO THESE
GUIDELINES AND BEFORE YOU
KNOW IT YOU WILL HAVE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT LICKED, IN WHICH
CASE YOU'LL NEED SOME MORE
TRAINING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
