EITHER THAT, OR YOU KNOW PICK UP SOME ROSES AT THE DELI.
GIRLS LIKE THAT STUFF.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE THE ECONOMIC MELTDOWN.
AND WHILE EVEN I USED TO BE MAD AT WALL STREET-- AT THIS POINT, WHO CAN EVEN REMEMBER WHO WIRED
THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO A ROULETTE WHEEL WHILE JACKED ON ENOUGH COCAINE TO BRING DOWN A BISON?
[LAUGHTER]
AND YET THE MADDOW-BLAZER-WEARING EZRA KLEIN-HOLES OUT THERE ARE STILL CALLING FOR BANKERS TO GO TO JAIL.
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LET BYGONE PENSIONS BE BYGONES?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW THE BANKS ARE ALSO GETTING HEAT FROM CONGRESS.
AND NOT IN THE USUAL WAY, WITH A WARM TONGUE BATH.
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TWO WEEKS AGO --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CALM DOWN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALSO A BIG PART OF LUPACALIA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TWO WEEKS AGO, SENATORS CHUCK GRASSLEY AND SHERROD BROWN ACCUSED THE BANKS OF NOT ONLY
BEING TOO BIG TO FAIL BUT ALSO, "TOO BIG TO JAIL."
[LAUGHTER]
MAYBE SO.
BUT HAVEN'T THEY BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH WITH STINGING WORDPLAY LIKE THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS
ON WALL STREET.
WE'RE SUPER-TIGHT.
THEY CALL ME UP AND GIVE ME STOCK TIPS, AND I PAY THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR MY BRO-- KERS
[LAUGHTER]
THE GOVERNMENT HAS FINALLY GROWN A PAIR.
>> THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 16 STATES DECLARED A KIND OF LEGAL WAR ON S&P, THE HUGE RATINGS AGENCY.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ACCUSES S&P OF A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD INVESTORS.
>> THE FEDS HAVE FILED A $5 BILLION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE RATING AGENCY STANDARD AND
POOR'S, CLAIMING THAT IT COMMITTED FRAUD WHEN IT GAVE HIGH RATINGS TO RISKY MORTGAGES.
>> Stephen: THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS STANDARD AND POOR'S COMMITTED FRAUD BY GIVING
TRIPLE-A RATINGS TO WHAT IT KNEW WERE WORTHLESS SECURITIES.
FOLKS, THAT'S (bleep)!
[LAUGHTER]
(bleep), BY THE WAY, ALSO GETS A TRIPLE-A RATING FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, TODAY THEY COME FOR THE RATINGS AGENCIES, TOMORROW THEY COME FOR THE BANKS, AND THAT'S
THE LAST THING OUR ECONOMY NEEDS.
A GALLUP POLL FOUND THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN BANKS IS ALREADY AT AN ALL-TIME LOW.
THAT INCLUDES THE 1930'S, WHEN BANKERS LOWERED CONFIDENCE BY OCCASIONALLY LANDING ON CONSUMERS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTIGATION WILL JUST MAKE THINGS WORSE.
I DON'T THINK THE BANKS ARE IN ANY FINANCIAL POSITION TO REVEAL WHAT FINANCIAL POSITION THEY'RE IN.
[LAUGHTER]
TAKE WELLS FARGO.
THEIR RECENT ANNUAL REPORT SAID THAT THE BANK'S VALUE IS PARTLY BASED ON, QUOTE, "SIGNIFICANT
ASSUMPTIONS NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET."
[LAUGHTER]
THAT MEANS THE VALUE OF THE LARGEST CAPITALIZED BANK IN THE UNITED STATES DEFIES OBSERVATION.
[LAUGHTER]
THE HUMAN MIND CANNOT PERCEIVE IT.
WE DARE NOT LOOK UPON IT.
[LAUGHTER]
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ACCOUNTANTS WHO OPENED LEHM
