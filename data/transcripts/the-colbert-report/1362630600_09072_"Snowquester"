[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
GLAD YOU ARE WITH ME HERE TONIGHT.
NATION, AL GORE SHOULD BE TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE,
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE IT'S MARCH 6TH AND IT IS STILL WINTER.
[LAUGHTER]
A MASSIVE STORM IS SWEEPING THE COUNTRY, SO I HOPE YOU'RE BUNDLED UP SOMEWHERE WARM,
SURROUNDED BY YOUR LOVED ONES.
PARTICULARLY YOUR SLOW MOVING, WELL-MARBLED LOVED ONES.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU NEVER KNOW.
NOW, THIS YEAR THE WEATHER CHANNEL HAS TAKEN TO NAMING ALL THE WINTER STORMS, THEY'RE
CALLING THIS ONE WINTER STORM SATURN.
PERSONALLY, I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH URANUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE PULLING THESE NAMES FROM.
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES, THE REST OF THE MEDIA HAS A MUCH BETTER NAME FOR THE STORM.
>> THE DREADED "S" WORD, SNOWQUESTER.
>> SNOWQUESTER.
>> SNOWQUESTER.
>> SNOWQUESTER.
>> SNOWQUESTER, RIGHT?
> THEY'RE CALLING IT SNOWQUESTER WHICH I THINK IS GREAT.
>> ISN'T THAT CUTE?
I THINK IT'S CUTE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: IT IS CUTE.
AND DEADLY.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THE SNOWQUESTER IS A COMBINATION OF SNOW AND THE SEQUESTER.
NATION, I THINK THIS FANTASTIC AND RIDICULOUS.
OR, FANTASTICULOUS.
[LAUGHTER]
WE SHOULD NAME ALL OF OUR WEATHER EVENTS AFTER WHAT KIND THEY ARE PLUS WHATEVER PEOPLE
ARE TALKING ABOUT ON TELEVISION AT THE TIME.
TODAY, A WASHINGTON IS BLANKETED IN THE SNOWQUESTER, TOMORROW, A STORM COVERS NEW YORK IN DRONE-CICLES.
[LAUGHTER]
OR A FREAK BLIZZ-ARDASHIAN.
AS WE SPEAK OKLAHOMA IS STILL SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF POPE BENE-DROUGHT THE 16TH?
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT CUTE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
KIND OF CUTE.
