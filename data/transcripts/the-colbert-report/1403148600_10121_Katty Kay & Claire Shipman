[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT HAVE A NEWBOOK ABOUT IMPROVING WOMEN'S
CONFIDENCE.
STEP ONE: WRITE A BOOK THAT GETSYOU ON MY SHOW.
PLEASE WELCOME KATTY KAY ANDCLAIRE SHIPMAN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]KATTY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
CLAIRE, THANKS FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.
>> Stephen: I'M A LITTLEOUTNUMBERED.
>> THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE IT.
>> Stephen: LET'S GET THIS THINGDONE HERE.
KATTY, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOWBEFORE.
CLAIRE, YOU'RE A LONGTIMECORRESPONDENT FOR ABC NEWS AND
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."
KATTY, YOU'RE AN ANCHOR FOR BBCWORLD NEWS AMERICA. AND YOU TWO
HAVE WRITTEN A NEW BOOK CALLED"THE CONFIDENCE CODE: THE
SCIENCE AND ART OFSELF-ASSURANCE - WHAT WOMEN
SHOULD KNOW".
WHY DO WOMEN NEED A BOOK TOTEACH THEM TO BE CONFIDENT?
ISN'T NEEDING A BOOK NEEDY?
>> IT IS.
>> Stephen: SHOULDN'T THEYHAVE THE CONFIDENCE?
I WANT TO SELL SOME BOOKS, DON'TGET ME WRONG, WE'RE GOING TO
SELL SOME BOOKS, BUT DOESN'T THEACT OF BUYING THE BOOK SEEM
LIKE YOU'RE NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGHDO IT BY YOURSELF?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WOMEN AT WORK DON'T FEEL ASCONFIDENT AS MEN DO OFTEN. IT
MANIFESTS ITSELF IN WAYS THATHAVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON
OUR CAREERS. FOR EXAMPLE, WOMENTEND TO APPLY FOR PROMOTIONS OR
JOBS WHEN WE FEEL WE HAVE 100%OF THE QUALIFICATIONS.
MEN, THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU, WILLDO IT WHEN THEY FEEL THEY HAVE
60% OF THE QUALIFICATIONS. SOYOU CAN
IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS OVER THECOURSE OF A CAREER.
>> Stephen: WE WING IT.
>> YOU WING IT.
>>>> Stephen: MEN WING IT.
WHY DON'T WOMEN HAVE THECONFIDENCE THEY NEED?
WHY DON'T THEY JUST GROW A PAIR.
THAT'S MY BOOK.
"GROWING A PAIR: WOMANHOOD THECOLBERT WAY."
>> IT WORKS FOR YOU, BUT ITDOESN'T SEEM TO WORK FOR MOST
WOMEN.
MEN ROUTINELY OVERESTIMATE THEIRABILITIES BY SOME 30%.
WOMEN TEND TO UNDERESTIMATETHEIR ABILITIES.
WHAT WE'RE TRYING DO WITH THISBOOK IS GET WOMEN'S PERCEPTION
OF THEIR TALENT IN LINE WITHTHEIR REAL TALENT.
WOMEN HAVE PLENTY OF TALENT.
WE JUST THINK THAT WE DON'T.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU ALWAYSCONFIDENT?
FOR INSTANCE, WHY DID IT TAKETWO OF DO YOU WRITE THE BOOK?
DID YOU NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCETO WRITE IT BY YOURSELVES?
>> YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO TEAM UP.
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S LIKE GOING TO THE BATHROOMTOGETHER.
>> HOW DID HE KNOW ABOUT THAT?
>> CONFIDENCE IS PARTLY GENETIC.
CLAIRE AND I FOR THE BOOK HADOUR GENES TESTED.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU FINDOUT?
>> WE ARE NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT,GENETICALLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE GENETHAT SAYS THAT YOU'RE NOT
CONFIDENT?
>> THIS MIGHT GET COMPLICATED.
STICK WITH US.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GENES THATCONTRIBUTE TO CONFIDENCE.
THERE'S NOT ONE CONFIDENCE GENE.
THEY AFFECT THINGS, THENEUROTRANSMITTERS IN OUR BRAIN
LIKE SERATONIN, DOPAMINE,OXYTOCIN
>> Stephen: TESTOSTERONE.
YOU GUYS SHOULD TRY SOMEANDROGEL.
>> RUB IT ALL OVER.
YES, TESTOSTERONE IS A HUGECONFIDENCE BOOST.
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU MAY KNOWTHIS, WOMEN DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
OF THAT AS MEN, BUT TESTOSTERONEENCOURAGES RISK TAKING, NOT
ALWAYS GREAT RISK TAKING,ECONOMIES CAN COLLAPSE.
THERE'S A LITTLE TOO MUCHTESTOSTERONE ON WALL STREET.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'S A FUNRIDE ON THE WAY.
>> I THINK IF WOMEN COULD TAKEMORE ACTION, TAKE MORE RISKS, BE
PREPARED TO FAIL, NOT BE SOPERFECT ALL THE TIME, WE'RE
OBSESSED WITH BEING PERFECT,THAT CAN HOLD US BACK FROM BEING
CONFIDENT.
I THINK...
>> Stephen: IS THAT JUSTHUBRIS THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE
OBSESSED WITH BEING PERFECT?
>> WELL, WE ARE PERFECT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
DOES EVERYONE START OUT WITH THESAME AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE AND
THEN IT'S WHITTLED AWAY IN, YOUKNOW, IN A PROCESS THAT
SCIENTISTS CALL MIDDLE SCHOOL?
IS THERE... IS IT NATURE OR ITIS NURTURE?
>> SOME OF IT IS NATURE, SOME25% IS WHAT WE'RE BORN WITH,
THAT'S OUR D.N.A.
AND SOME OF IT IS WHAT HAPPENSTO US IN SCHOOL, AND ACTUALLY,
GIRLS ARE DOING GREAT INSCHOOL.
WE'RE GETTING STRAIGHT As.WE'RE COLORING IN
THE LINES AND KEEPING OUR HEADSDOWN AND DOING SUPER WELL.
THEN WE LEAVE SCHOOL AND SOMEHOWTHE RULES CHANGE.
>> Stephen: THE BOOK IS CALLED"THE CONFIDENCE CODE."
YOU ALSO WROTE A COVER ARTICLEFOR "THE ATLANTIC" CALLED "THE
CONFIDENCE GAP."
WHICH IS IT, A CODE OR AGAP, AND DOES THE CONFIDENCE GAP
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THETHIGH GAP?
>> WE'RE NOT GOING THERE.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEANBY CODE?
WHAT IS THE CODE?
>> WHAT IS THE CODE?
SHOULD WE TELL HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU READY?
>> Stephen: I'M READY.
BY THE WAY, BEFORE WE GET TO THECODE, THERE'S A TEST YOU CAN
TAKE.
YOU GO ONLINE AND TAKE THE TEST.
AND ABOUT YOUR LEVEL OFCONFIDENCE.
NOW, WILL THIS... I'M HESITANTTO TAKE THE TEST BECAUSE I'M
AFRAID... I THINK I'M A MAN.
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT FIND OUT FROMTHE TEST THAT I'M JUST
AN EXTREMELY CONFIDENT WOMAN.
>> IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THAT OUTALREADY, STEPHEN, THEN I'M NOT
SURE WE CAN HELP YOU.
>> Stephen: I HAVECHILD-BEARING HIPS.
>> HE'S TRYING TO GET BACK TOTHE THIGHS AGAIN.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: FOR ANYONE OUTTHERE WHO HAS DAUGHTERS, WHAT'S
THE THING YOU CAN DO TO GIVETHEM THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE?
>> WE HAVE FOUND A COUPLEOF THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, DO LET THEM FAIL.
LET THEM RISK.
DON'T LET THEM FOCUS ALL THETIME ON GETTING A PERFECT SCORE
ON EVERY TEST, TURNING IN ALL OFTHEIR HOMEWORK ON TIME.
I KNOW THAT SOUNDSCOUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT WHEN THEY
SAY, WHO CARES, LET THEM LEARNFROM THAT.
LET THEM GO WITH THAT.
SPORTS.
SPORTS IS ALSO INCREDIBLYIMPORTANT FOR GIRLS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, NOTJUST FOR BEING HEALTHY.
>> IT TEACHES US TO WIN, BUTALSO TO LOSE.
THAT BUSINESS OF FAILING AGAIN.
YOU LOSE A GAME AND YOU REALIZEYOU HAVE TO CARRY ON PLAYING.
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR TEAM DOWN.
GET BACK OUT ON TO THE PITCH.
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen: HOW IMPORTANT ITIS TO BE A [BLEEPED] ARTIST?
BECAUSE MEN ARE SUPREME BULL[BLEEPED] ARTISTS.
IN TODAY'S "NEW YORK TIMES"THERE WAS A STUDY BY THE PEW
RESEARCH CENTER THAT SAYS MALEPOLITICIANS MORE OFTEN LIE IN
STUMP SPEECHES, BUT THE AUDIENCETENDS TO BELIEVE THEM MORE
BECAUSE OF THE CONFIDENCE WITHWHICH THEY TELL THE STATISTICS
ON THE STUMP SPEECH.
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE.
I JUST MADE THAT STUDY UP.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU SO MUCH.
KATTY KAY, CLAIRE SHIPMAN, "THECONFIDENCE CODE."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
