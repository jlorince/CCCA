ANTI-EARMARK PLEDGE, AND I'M
PRETTY SURE MITCH MCCONNELL HAS
INSPIRED MILLIONS TO TAKE AN
ABSTINENCE PLEDGE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT RIGHT NOW SCANDAL IS ROCKING
THE REPUBLICAN PLEDGE-SCAPE.
FOR MORE, LET'S GO TO ME ON A
DIFFERENT CAMERA.
[LAUGHTER]
THANKS STEPHEN.
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE
"MARRIAGE VOW" PUT OUT BY THE
IOWA CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN
GROUP, THE FAMILY LEADER AND
IT'S HEAD, BOB VANDER PLAATZ.
IN THE 14-POINT PLEDGE
CANDIDATES HAVE TO FIRST VOW
"PERSONAL FIDELITY TO MY
SPOUSE."
IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR CANDIDATES TO
SWEAR TO THAT ONE.
CUZ THAT VOW THEY SAID AT THEIR
WEDDING (bleep).
THIS IS SOMETHING BINDING -- A
PDF SENT TO YOU BY SOME GUY
NAMED VANDER PLAATZ.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THE REST OF THE PLEDGE DEFENDS
MARRIAGE BY VOWING "VIGOROUS
OPPOSITION TO INTIMATE UNIONS
WHICH ARE BIGAMOUS, POLYGAMOUS,
POLYANDROUS, SAME SEX, ETC."
[LAUGHTER]
THAT ET CETERA IS AN ESSENTIAL
CATCH-ALL, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF FREAKY STUFF GOIN' ON IN
IOWA.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY?
MAN ON CORN, CORN ON MAN, CORN
ON COB, BUTTER ON CORN ON COB ON
MAN.
BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
"STEPHEN, THAT SOUNDS DELICIOUS,
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS
PLEDGE HAD SOMETHING
CONTROVERSIAL IN IT."
WELL, IT DOES.
IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE PLEDGE.
HERE ON THE FIRST PAGE.
>> IT SAYS THAT SLAVERY HAD A
DISASTROUS IMPACT ON
AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES, YET
SADLY A CHILD BORN INTO SLAVERY
IN 1860 WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE
RAISED BY HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
IN A TWO-PARENT HOUSEHOLD THAN
WAS AFRICAN-AMERICAN BABY BORN
AFTER THE ELECTION OF THE FIRST
OF USA'S FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN
PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: TOUGH MEDICINE, BUT
IT'S TRUE.
UNDER SLAVERY NOT ONLY DID BLACK
KIDS HAVE A FATHER AND A MOTHER,
BUT A LOT OF TIME THEY HAD A
BIOLOGICAL FATHER  WHO ALSO
OWNED THEM.
THAT'S BEING INVESTED IN YOUR
KIDS LIVES.
[LAUGHTER]
SO FAR ONLY TWO CANDIDATES HAVE
HAD THE COURAGE TO SIGN THE
PLEDGE.
ONE WAS FORMER PUBLIC FIGURE
RICK SANTORUM.
JIM?
>> THIS IS A PLEDGE YOU WOULD
SIGN?
>> IN FACT I ACTUALLY DID SIGN,
YES.
>> YOU DID SIGN IT.
>> LOOK, WHEN I FIRST READ IT I
WAS TAKEN ABACK, BUT I CAN'T
ARGUE THAT I WASN'T.
>> Stephen: YES, HE SIGNED IT,
BUT ONLY AFTER HE WAS TAKEN
ABACK, OKAY?
GOES LIKE THIS.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, NO.
WHAT THE -- WHAT THE --
(bleep) OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THE OTHER PERSON TO STEP UP,
DO THE RIGHT THING AND SIGN THE
PLEDGE IS MICHELE BACHMANN
WHO USED THE PUBLIC BACKLASH
AGAINST THE PREAMBLE'S
INSENSITIVE SLAVERY REFERENCE TO
MAKE A SENSITIVE SLAVERY
REFERENCE.
>> HERE IS THE STATEMENT AGAINST
HER SPOKESWOMAN.
SHE BELIEVES SLAVERY WAS
HORRIBLE AND ECONOMIC
ENSLAVEMENT IS ALSO HORRIBLE.
>> YES, TAXATION IS ECONOMIC
SLAVERY.
AND MICHELE BACHMANN STANDS UP
AGAINST SLAVERY IN ALL FORMS--
WHETHER IT'S THE SLAVERY OF
HEALTHCARE--
>> THIS IS SLAVERY.
IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN SLAVERY.
>> Stephen: THE SLAVERY OF THE
NATIONAL DEBT--
>> IT IS A SLAVERY, IT IS A
SLAVERY THAT IS A BONDAGE TO
DEBT AND A BONDAGE TO DECLINE.
>> Stephen: OR SLAVERY OF THE
LOINS--
>> IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THE GAY
AND LESBIAN LIFESTYLE, IT'S
BONDAGE.
IT IS PERSONAL BONDAGE, PERSONAL
DESPAIR AND PERSONAL
ENSLAVEMENT.
>> Stephen: YES, PERSONAL
ENSLAVEMENT.
OR PERSONAL DOMINATION,
DEPENDING ON WHAT ROLE YOU'RE
PLAYING THAT NIGHT.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE A
PERSONAL SAFE-WORD.
PERHAPS BACHMANN.
YOU SEE, SHE'S SENSITIVE TO THE
PAIN OF SLAVERY BECAUSE TO HER,
EVERYTHING IS SLAVERY.
"DONT' WALK" SIGNS -- THAT'S
JUST AMBULATORY SLAVERY.
[LAUGHTER]
FAT FREE CHEESE -- THAT'S JUST
FLAVOR SLAVERY OR "FLAVORY."
[LAUGHTER]
THE FAMILY LEADER HAS
PULLED THE SLAVERY STATEMENT
FROM THE PREAMBLE BUT THESE TWO
SIGNED IT BEFORE THEY TOOK THE
SLAVERY LANGUAGE OUT.
AND I HOPE THEY LIVE BY THOSE
WORDS.
BUT WITH ALL THESE PLEDGES OUT
THERE, HOW CAN CANDIDATES KEEP
TRACK OF EVERYTHING THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE HONORING?
WELL, I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE
STEPHEN COLBERT'S PLEDGE SHOCK
COLLAR.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S THE SAME SOUND-RECOGNITION
TECHNOLOGY THAT TRAINS DOGS TO
STOP BARKING.
IT'S GOT TWO ELECTRODES, RIGHT
HERE.
YOU JUST STRAP IT ON THE
CANDIDATE LIKE THIS.
GET THAT SUCKER ON THERE NICE.
AND TIGHT.
OKAY.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY.
NOW.
THE CANDIDATE WEARS IT,
AND IF THE CANDIDATE EVER
FORGETS THE PLEDGES HE HAS
SIGNED AND -- I DON'T KNOW --
SAYS THAT WE SHOULD RAISE TAXES
ON THE TOP TWO PER--
ARRRRGGGGHHH!
[ APPLAUSE ]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
