NEWT WITH A BULLET.
NATION, I SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER
JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.
WAIT TILL THE MOVIE COMES OUT.
( LAUGHTER ).
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
( CHEERS )
YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS
SUPPORTED FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND
LIBERTARIAN BRIDGE TROLL RON
PAUL.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S WHY I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT
THE NEW 2012 PINUPS FOR RON PAUL
CALENDARS FULL OF LOVELY LADIES
THAT ILLUSTRATE IMPORTANT
LIBERTARIAN CAUSES.
FOR INSTANCE, MISS OCTOBER IS
DRESSED AS LADY LIBERTY ABOUT TO
HAVE HER BLOOD SUCKED BY THE
DRACULA OF WAR, INFLATION, AND
BAILOUTS, WHILE UNDERSTAND IN
THE GRAVEYARD OF PEACE AND
LIBERTY.
CRISP, CLEAR, MESSAGING.
BUT A LITTLE SIMPLISTIC.
FOR NEXT YEAR, MIGHT I SUGGEST A
SEXY BETSY ROSS SEWING A FLAG
LABELED CAP AND TRADE WHILE AN
F.D.A. FRANKENSTEIN SNEAKS UP ON
HER WITH A KNIFE LABELED SOCIAL
SAFETY NET, AND A NET LABELED
DEBT WHILE THEY'RE ON A HIGH
WIRE OF FREEDOM OVER A BUBBLING
LAVA PIT LABELED FREE SCHOOL
LUNCHES.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
NOW-- BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS
CALENDAR, I HAVE TO WAG MY
FINGER AT PINUPS FOR RON PAUL.
BECAUSE THIS ALLEGEDLY
LIBERTARIAN PRODUCT FEATURES ALL
THE FEDERALLY MANDATED HOLIDAYS.
WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL ME
WHAT DAY TO CELEBRATE THE
4th OF JULY?
AND WHY ARE WE LETTING THE
GOVERNMENT REGULATE THE NUMBER
OF DAYS IN A YEAR?
IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO
TO A DECIMAL SYSTEM, WHICH
AUSTRIAN ECONOMIST LUDWIG VON
MISES HAS PROVEN WOULD SAVE US
6.7 HECHTA-HOURS PER KILO-ANNUM.
A TRUE LIBERTARIAN PINUP
CALENDAR WOULD JUST BE ONE PAGE.
THE BOTTOM WOULD BE BLANK SO THE
FREE MARKET COULD DECIDE WHAT
DAY IT IS AND THE TOP WOULD JUST
BE A MIRROR BECAUSE YOU ARE THE
ONLY ONE WHO MATTERS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
HELLO.
HELLO!
HELLO, MR. NOVEMBER.
GOT ANYTHING ON DOWN THERE?
OH!
OH!
OH, MY.
ALL RIGHT.
PERSONALLY, I CAN'T WAIT FOR
HERMAN CAIN'S CALENDAR WHICH
FEATURES THE SEXY SILHOUETTES OF
12 WOMEN HE PAID TO STAY
ANONYMOUS.
NEXT, FOLKS, I WAS HAPPY TO SEE
A RECENT DEBATE, THE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES STOOD UP FOR A CORE
AMERICAN VALUE.
>> IF I WERE PRESIDENT, I WOULD
BE WILLING TO USE WATERBOARDING.
I THINK IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.
>> I WOULD RETURN TO THAT
POLICY.
I DON'T SEE IT AS TORTURE.
>> I WILL BE FOR IT UNTIL I DIE.
>> Stephen:  NOTICE PERRY
SURPRISED ME THERE.
HE IS NOT KNOWN FOR THE
SIMULATED KILLING OF PRISONERS.
OF COURSE, OUR WET BLANKET IN
CHIEF HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION.
>> ANYBODY WHO HAS ACTUALLY READ
ABOUT AND UNDERSTANDS THE
PRACTICE OF WATERBOARDING WOULD
SAY THAT THAT IS TORTURE.
>> Stephen:  FINE.
IF I DON'T READ ABOUT IT OR
UNDERSTAND IT I STILL SAY IT'S A
LUNG JACUZZI.
LUCKILY, FOLKS, THERE IS ONE
BRAVE VOICE STANDING UP FOR
WHAT'S RIGHT SO A TIP OF MY HAT
TO FLORIDA REPRESENTATIVE ALAN
WEST.
JIM, PLAY THE MAN.
>> AND AS THE PRESIDENT, YOU
NEED TO DO THOSE THINGS WHICH
ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE KEPT
SAFE.
FURTHERMORE INITIATE MOVIE "G.I.
JANE," DEMY MOORE WAS
WATERBOARDED.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS I NEED NO
FURTHER PROOF THAT WATERBOARDING
IS EFFECT AND I HAVE NECESSARY
FROM THE FACT THAT IT WAS USED
ON DEMI MOORE.
THAT MOVIE CAME OUT 14 YEARS AGO
AND SHE STILL LOOKS INCREDIBLE.
WE SHOULD CALL IT "COUGAR
BOARDING."
I BELIEVE ALAN WEST IS ON TO
SOMETHING.
IF IT'S OKAY TO DO IT IN A 57,
IT IS A VALID INTERROGATION
TACTIC.
THEREFORE, DETAINEES SHOULD BE
FORCED TO DRINK OIL, HAVE THEIR
BRAINS SUCKUD OUT BY A GIANT
BUG, OR PLAY SHIRTLESS BEACH
VOLLEYBALL IN TIGHT JEANS.
FINALLY, EYE-OPENING CONSUMER
NEWS FROM KCBS, LOS ANGELES'
NEWS LEADER.
>> LAITLE NECKLACE IS CAUTION A
BIG CONTROVERSY AT FOREVER 21
CLOTHING STORES.
IT'S CALLED THE ORIENTAL GIRL
NECKLACE.
IT HAS THE INTERNET BECAUSING
WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THE TERM
ORIENTAL IS RACIST AND SAY THE
CHARM ITSELF IS DEROGATORY IN
ITS DEPICTION OF AIR,IAN WOMEN.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY SO ANGRY THEY HATE YOU LONG
TIME.
( LAUGHTER ).
FOLKS, THIS CONTROVERSIAL
NECKLACE HAS BEEN PULLED FROM
THE SHELVES, SO IF YOU BOUGHT
ONE, IT IS NOW A RARE
COLLECTOR'S ITEM.
BECAUSE FOREVER 21 RECENTLY HAD
TO STOP SELLING AN OFFENSIVE
GIRLS' T-SHIRT THAT READ,
"ALLERGIC TO ALGEBRA."
THAT DISCONTINUED $12.80 SHIRT
SHOWED UP ON E-BAY FOR $16.99
WHICH EVEN A GIRL KNOWS IS MORE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
MY HAT TO OFFENSIVE MERCHANDISE.
IT IS A STABLE, LONG-TERM
INVESTMENT.
FOR INSTANCE, BACK IN 2002,
BEFORE THIS LONG BROTHERS
LAUNDRY SERVICE T-SHIRT WAS
PULLED FROM SHELVED AT
ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH.
IT WENT FOR 25 BUCKS.
IT NOW FETCHES 65.
THIS STUNNED MARKET WATCHERS WHO
WERE SURPRISED THAT ABERCROMBIE
SOLD CLOTHING.
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE
SOME REAL MONEY I SAY CUT OUT
THE MIDDLE MAN AND SELL YOUR OWN
DISCONTINUED RACIST MERCHANDISE,
LIKE T-SHIRTS WITH HIP PHRASES
LIKE NOT SQUINTING, JUST COR18.
AND MULATTOS HAVE MIXED FEELINGS
WHICH OF COURSE COULDS IN A
COLPOLY-COTTON
