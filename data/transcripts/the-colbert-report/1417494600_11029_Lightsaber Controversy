DINNER AT MY HOUSE WAS GREATAS ALWAYS.
THIS YEAR I GOT THE WISHBONE AND MY WISH CAME TRUE.
THE DOCTORS WERE ABLE TOREMOVE IT FROM MY THROAT.

STARTING WITH A MAJORCONFLICT ONCE AGAIN IN A
TROUBLED DESERT REGION.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
WHOOO. (MAKING GUN SOUNDS) DON'TGET COCKY, KID.
THE NEW STAR WARS TRAILERDROPPED OVER THANKSGIVING
WEEKEND.
AND IT WAS ALL ANYONE IN MYFAMILY COULD TALK ABOUT.
WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, LEADTO MY AUNT RITA SAYING SOME
HORRIBLY RACIST THINGS ABOUT THE GUNGAN.
FOLKS, I, I AM THE ORIGINALFAN OF STAR WARS.
IN 1977, THIS IS A TRUESTORY, WHEN I WAS IN 8th
GRADE, I WON TWO TICKETSFROM A LOCAL RADIO STATION
TO SEE THIS NEW MOVIE STARWARS TWO WEEKS BEFORE IT
CAME OUT NATIONALLY.
NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS GOING TOBE, HASKEL FEUDENBERG'S MOM
DROVE DOES.
AND I LOVED IT IT ON THE WAYHOME THERES WITH A FULL
MOON.
I PRETENDED IT WAS THEDEATHSTAR IT BUT AT SCHOOL
ON MONDAY, I COULDN'TEXPLAIN HOW EVERYTHING WAS
DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE NOBODYHAD SEEN IT. THEY THOUGHT
MY DARTH VADER IMPRESSIONWAS JUST ASTHMA.
THOUGH, THOUGH I WILL SAY, IDID GET OUT OF GYM FOR A
MONTH.
THEN THE MOVIE COMES OUT.
EVERYBODY IS SAYING IT ISTHE GREATEST THING EVER BUT
I SAW IT FIRST, I HAVE BEENA STAR WARS FAN TWO WEEKS
LONGER THAN ANY OF YOU.
NOW LET ME TELL YOU-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND LET ME TELLYOU, FOLKS, THIS TRAILER HAS
GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN ASTAR WARS MOVIE.
WAKE SURFING E-WICK, R2-D2'SHEAD PLAYING SOCCER, EVEN A
BLACK STORMTROOPER.
SO FOR THE RECORD, JAWAS, IFHE STOPS YOU AND FRISKS YOU,
IT'S NOT RACIST.
ALSO, YOU ARE KIND OF ASKINGFOR IT IT THOSE HOODIES.
AND FOLKS, THAT'S NOT-- NO,NO, IT IS NOT THE JAWAS
FAULT.
THAT IS NOT EVEN THE BESTPART, FOLKS.
CHECK OUT THIS AWESOMELIGHTSABER.
IT'S A LIGHTSABER WITH TWOMINI LIGHTSABERS ON IT. IT'S
A MENAGE-A-SABRE.
SADLY, SADLY I THINK I HAVEA WOOKIEE IN THE AUDIENCE.
SADLY, THERE ARE SOME STUCKUP HALF WITTED SCRUFFY
LOOKING NERF HERDERS OUT THEREWHO AREN'T THRILLED WITH THE
NEW JEDI WEAPON.
THEY SAY IF THESE THINGS ARESUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOUR
HANDS LIKE SWORD HILTS ITWOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THE
FIRST TIME YOU CROSSLIGHTSABERS AND IT SLID DOWN
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BLADEYOUR OPPONENT'S LIGHTSABER
WOULD CHOP THROUGH THE SIDESABRES AND TAKE OFF YOUR HAND.
OR AS IT WAS STATED ONTWITTER, "HILT ON LIGHT SABER
STUPID AND IMPRACTICAL CHILDHOODRUINED, EVERYTHING RUINED."
YEAH.
(APPLAUSE)RUINED.
WELL, I SAY IT'S THE PERFECTDESIGN, HERE IS HOW IT
WORKS.
I HAVE DONE MY ANALYSIS,OKAY.
PEOPLE THINK, PEOPLE THINKIT'S ACTUALLY THREE
DIFFERENT PLASMA STREAMS BUTIT'S ALL ONE.
THE LONG BEAM, THE LONG BEAMRIGHT HERE, OKAY, IT COMES
OUT AND THE TWO SMALLERBEAMS AT THE BOTTOM, OKAY,
THEY'RE STILL ATTACHED TO ITIT THEY DON'T START WHERE
THE LITTLE METAL HILT ENDS,OKAY.
THEY'RE ATTACHED TO THEOTHER BEAM INSIDE.
THE METAL HILTS ARE JUSTCASINGS AROUND THE LITTLE
BEAM TO PROTECT YOUR HAND.
EVEN IF SOMEONE SLICESTHROUGH THE METAL THEY'RE
GOING TO HIT THE BEAM RIGHTTHERE.
ANY PADAWAN KNOWS THAT.
NOW I KNOW-- THAT ISSCIENCE.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: NOW I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
YOU'RE SAYING BUT STEPHEN,IN THE TRAILER THE FIRST
LIGHT BEAM COMES OUT BEFORETHE OTHER TWO.
HOW COULD IT ALL BE ONEBEAM.
WELL, GREG, IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU JUST NEED THREE FOCUSINGCRYSTAL ACTIVATORS TO SPLIT
THE PLASMA INTOPERPENDICULAR BLADE ENERGY
CHANNELS.
CONFUSED?
WELL, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND INTWO WEEKS WHEN YOU CATCH UP
WITH WHERE I'M AT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I HAVE HAD IT.
AMATEUR HOUR IS OVER.
THE PROS ARE TAKING IT OVERON THIS ONE.
