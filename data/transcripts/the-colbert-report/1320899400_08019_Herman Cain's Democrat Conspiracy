[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
FOLKS, THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS KEEP COMING AT
HERMAN CAIN LIKE AN UNINVITED
HAND UP A PLEATED SKIRT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND CAIN ISN'T AFRAID TO POINT
OUT WHAT'S REALLY BEHIND THESE
CHARGES.
>> A BUSINESSMAN BY THE NAME OF
HERMAN CAIN STEPPED FORWARD.
THAT'S ONE THING ABOUT HERMAN
CAIN THAT I THINK THAT A LOT OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE
HERMAN CAIN GET THE REPUBLICAN
NOMINATION, AND SOME PEOPLE
DON'T WANT HERMAN CAIN TO BECOME
PRESIDENT.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEIR
MOTIVATION IS, OTHER THAN IT'S
TO STOP HERMAN CAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
EVEN IF THESE CHARGES ARE PROVEN
TRUE AND HERMAN CAIN DID
SEXUALLY HARASS THESE WOMEN, HOW
DO WE KNOW IT'S THIS HERMAN
CAIN? EVIDENTLY THERE'S ANOTHER
HERMAN CAIN OUT THERE THAT THIS
ONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, STEPHEN COLBERT THINKS
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO TAKE HERMAN
CAIN DOWN.
THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP HIM FROM
PROMOTING HIS 9-9-9 PLAN, OR
BUILDING HIS ELECTRIC FENCE THAT
KILLS MEXICANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND HE APPEARS TO HAVE A GREAT
JOBS PLAN, BECAUSE SHARON BIALEK
SAID HE WAS GONNA GIVE HER A JOB
AT HIS COMPANY, IF SHE WOULD
FIRST GIVE HIM A JOB IN HIS
FRONT SEAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S ALLEGED.
THAT'S ALLEGED.
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW
ABOUT THE NUMBER 45, A SPECIAL
NUMBER THAT CAIN DEVOTES AN
ENTIRE CHAPTER TO IN HIS BOOK
"THIS IS HERMAN CAIN."
FROM THE CHAPTER ENTITLED "45",
QUOTE:
"PEOPLE OFTEN ATTACH GREAT
SIGNIFICANCE TO A NUMBER-- IN MY
CASE, THAT NUMBER IS 45.
THE NUMBER 45 KEEPS POPPING UP."
CAIN WAS BORN IN 19-"45."
HE'S RUNNING TO BE OUR 45TH
PRESIDENT.
HE MET HIS WIFE ON APRIL 5TH, OR
4/5.
4 PLUS 5 IS NINE-- AS IN 9-9-9.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLUS, THERE'S THAT JIM CARREY
MOVIE WHERE HE BECOMES OBSESSED
WITH
THE NUMBER 23-- AND AFTER 2 AND
3 COMES 4 AND 5!
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE WERE 4 PEOPLE ACCUSING HIM
OF INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL
ADVANCES, NOW THERE ARE 5.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND TO KEEP ONE OF THOSE WOMEN
QUIET HIS COMPANY PAID HER
$45,000 THOUSAND DOLLARS TO KEEP
QUIET!
SPLENDOR!
IT ALL COHERES!
I CAN SEE FOREVER!
[ LAUGHTER ]
