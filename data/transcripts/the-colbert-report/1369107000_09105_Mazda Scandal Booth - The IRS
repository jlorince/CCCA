SO BENGHAZI, DONE.
WHAT'S NEXT?
LET'S HEAD BACK OVER TO THE
MAZDA SCANDAL BOOTH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME TO THE MAZDA SCANDAL
BOOTH.
MAZDA, IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
JIMMY, LET'S SWIRL UP SOME
JOURNALISM.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IRS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE,
WHICH REMINDS ME, IF ANYONE
ASKS, THAT BOOTH IS MY HOME
OFFICE.
ALSO MY SON.
FOLKS, THE I.R.S. HAS RECENTLY
ADMITTED SINGLING OUT
APPLICATIONS FOR TAX-EXEMPT
STATUS FROM GROUPS WITH WORDS
LIKE TEA PARTY, PATRIOTS, 9-12,
OR SAID THEY WANTED TO MAKE
AMERICA A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE.
THESE FLAGGED GROUPS WERE WHICH
LED TO MASSIVE DPLAIS A PROCESS
WHICH FOX NEWS DESCRIBES AS SLOW
WALKING WHICH ALSO DESCRIBES
THEIR VIEWERS.
( APPLAUSE )
AND LAST WEEK, THE SCANDAL
CLAIMED ITS FIRST VICTIM.
>> NOW TO WASHINGTON WHERE THE
I.R.S. SCANDAL HAS CAUSED THE
MAN AT THE TOP TO LOSE HIS JOB.
STEVE MILLER HAD BEEN ACTING
COMMISSIONER OF THE AGENCY FOR
JUST SIX MONTHS.
>> Stephen: YES, OBAMA DUMPED
ACTING I.R.S. COMMISSIONER STEVE
MILLER AND I SAY IT'S ABOUT
TIME.
MY SOURCES TELL ME HE'S A JOKER,
A SMOKER AND A MIDNIGHT TOKER.
( APPLAUSE )
AND OFTEN USES THE ALIAS
MAURICE.
NOW, THE TAX EXEMPT GROUP
SINGLED OUT BY THE I.R.S. ARE
ALL SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS
KNOWN AS 501(C)4s.
WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE
CON TAPES GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF
THE U.S. TAX CODE.
>> THE C-4 DESIGNATION GREW IN
VALUE IN 2010 RIGHT AFTER THE
SUPREME COURT SAID CORPORATIONS
COULD SPEND UNLIMITED CASH ON
ELECTIONS, C-4 APPLICATIONS MORE
THAN DOUBLED.
C4s ARE SPECIFICALLY FORBIDDEN
TO MAKE POLITICS THEIR PRIMARY
ACTIVITY BUT ONE ADVANTAGE, THEY
DON'T HAVE TO REVEAL THEIR
DONORS
>> Stephen: A C-4 IS LIKE A
SUPER PAC THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO
REVEAL ITS DONORS WHICH MEANS
THEY COULD BE ANYONE FROM ONE OF
THE KOCH BROTHERS ALL THE WAY TO
THE OTHER KOCH BROTHER.
AND IT IS ALL PERFECTLY LEGAL AS
LONG AS POLITICS ISN'T THE
GROUP'S PRIMARY ACTIVITY MEANING
YOUR 501(C)4 CAN SPEND 49% OF
ITS EFFORTS PRODUCING ADS
CALLING BARACK OBAMA A SOCIALIST
AS LONG AS IT SPENDS THE OTHER
51% DOING SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE
COMMUNITY LIKE EDUCATING OUR
CHILDREN THAT BARACK OBAMA IS A
SOCIALIST.
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW I HAVE
MY OWN 501(C)4, COLBERT SUPER
PAC S-H-H OR SHHHH.
AND FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING
DOWN BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER
RECEIVED I.R.S. APPROVAL FOR MY
C-4.
(AUDIENCE GROANS)
>> Stephen: VERY GOOD.
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS WHOLE
SCANDAL IS REALLY ABOUT ME?
I'LL CHECK.
>> IT'S ABOUT YOU.
KNEW IT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WHEN WE RETURN, WE WILL GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF ME.
WITH SUPER STARRY LECHES LAWYER
TREVOR POTTER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
