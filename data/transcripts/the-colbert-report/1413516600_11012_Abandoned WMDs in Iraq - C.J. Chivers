(LAUGHTER)POINT IS, THE STORY PROVES ONCE
AND FOR ALL THAT THE WAR WASCOMPLETELY NECESSARY AND
JUSTIFIED.
HERE TO SAY HIS STORY DOESN'TSAY THAT IS PULITZER PRIZE
WINNING REPORTER FROM THE "NEWYORK TIMES,"
REPORTER C.J. CHIVERS. GOOD TOSEE YOU.
HERE'S THE ARTICLE BLOWING THELID OFF EVERYTHING.
HERE'S MY NUMBER ONE QUESTION.
PROVES WE HAD WMDs THERE INIRAQ.
WHY DIDN'T GEORGE BUSH BRAGABOUT THIS MORE BECAUSE THE
EGG ON HIS FACE IS THAT THEREWERE NO WMDs.
WAS HE BEING JUST TOO HUMBLEHERE?
WAS THE WAR SO POPULAR HE DIDN'TWANT TO RUN UP THE SCOREBOARD AT
THIS POINT?>>  THESE WEREN'T THE WMDs HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT. THESE WEAPONSWERE OLD DISCARDED JUNK FROM
ABOUT TWO WARS BEFORE.
>> Stephen: DON'T TRY YOUROBI-WAN KENOBI "THESE AREN'T THE
DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKINGFOR" ON ME (LAUGHTER)
>> THEY WEREN'T EVEN USED ASWMDs
>> Stephen: SO THEY'RE NOTDANGEROUS AT ALL?
>> THEY'RE DANGEROUS, THEY'REUSED IN LOCAL ATTACKS AND
IMPROVISED BOMBS WHERE THEY WEREDISCARDED IN OLD STOCKPILES.
>> Stephen: WHY DIDN'T WE FINDOUT ABOUT THEM AT ALL TILL YOUR
ARTICLE.
>> ACTUALLY YOU DID.
THROUGH 2004, OUR GOVERNMENT HADA GOOD RECORD OF DISCLOSING A
LOT OF THE INFORMATION.
CHARLES DUELFER IN THE IRAQSURVEY GROUP GAVE US A THOROUGH
REPORT THROUGH 2004 THAT STANDSUP TO THIS DAY, BUT BY 2006 THEY
STOPPED TALKING ABOUT IT AND IN2006 THE NUMBER OF DISCOVERIES
TOOK OFF AND THE NUMBER OFTROOPS THAT WERE WOUNDED ALSO
ACCELERATED SHARPLY AND AT THATPOINT THERE HAD BEEN A TURN IN
THE PRACTICE AND THEY WEREN'TTALKING ABOUT IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WEREN'T.
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHY THISSUDDENLY BECAME A SECRET?
>> THROUGH 2004, THE RECORD'SGOOD.
HAD THEY CONTINUED THE PRACTICE,I WOULDN'T HAVE TO SIT HERE AND
TELL YOU ABOUT THIS.
THIS COULD HAVE COME OUT INREALTIME AND BEEN A SERIES OF
SMALL STORIES AND DIGESTED BYTHE PERSON PUBLIC AND THE BODY
POLITIC A LONG TIME AGO.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF SMALLSTORIES, THIS IS NOT A SMALL
STORY.
NOT ONLY HAS IT MADE A BIGSPLASH, BUT IT'S AN EXTREMELY
LONG ARTICLE IN HERE.
IS THIS WHY THE "NEW YORK TIMES"DOESN'T HAVE A COMICS PAGE?
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE ZIGGY NEVER DEPRESSES ME
LIKE THIS.
>> I THINK IT'S SHORT.
I FILED TWICE AS LONG.
>> Stephen: REALLY? AND THEY CUTIT IN HALF?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU ALREADY GOT APULITZER. WHEN YOU HOLD UP YOUR
PULITZER, DOES IT GLOW BLUE LIKESTING DOES WHEN ORCS ARE AROUND?
>> NO, THIS IS A STORY ABOUTENLISTED SOLDIERS WHO HAD ONE OF
THE MOST DANGEROUS JOBS ON THEBATTLEFIELD IN THE LAST WAR, WHO
WORKED HARD, SERVED WELL,SUFFERED SOMETHING SURPRISING
AND WERE AT A MINIMUMCASUALTY-NEGLECTED IF NOT
OUTRIGHT ABUSED.
>> Stephen: DID THE GUYS WHOFOUND THE STUFF, THEY WERE
INJURED BY THIS.
>> MANY WERE NOT WOUNDED.
SOME WERE WOUNDED.
>> Stephen: DID THEY GET APURPLE HEART?
>> MOST OF THEM DID NOT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE IT HAD TOBE A SECRET?
>> THEY DIDN'T GET PURPLE HEARTSFOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT
AMONG THEM IS THE PURPLE HEARTSYSTEM BY MY ESTIMATE IS BROKEN.
THERE ARE FOUR SERVICES THATHAVE DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND
DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR GETTINGTHE PURPLE HEART.
SOME OF THESE MEMBERS WERE NOTRECOMMENDED FOR PURPLE HEARTS,
OTHERS WERE BY COMMANDERS ANDDENIED BY THE SERVICES.
ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT A STAFFSERGEANT HAD A PURPLE HEART
GIVEN BY THE SECRETARY OF THEARMY AND SOMEONE SEVERAL WEEKS
LATER CAME ALONG AND TOOK IT OFFHIS CHEST.
>> Stephen: WHY WAS IT TAKENOFF?
>> THEY SAID THEY ERRONEOUSLYISSUED IT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THE EVENTWAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE
HAPPENED?
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION I HAVEBEEN ASKING THEM FOR MANY
MONTHS.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT MEDICALCARE?
THESE SOLDIERS, I UNDERSTANDTHAT SOMETIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT
TOLD THAT THEY'D ENCOUNTEREDCHEMICAL WEAPONS FOR SECRECY
REASONS.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT SECRECY,THAT'S RIGHT. FOR MANY OF THESE
TROOPS THE CHEMICAL SYMPTOMSTOOK TIME TO MANIFEST
THEMSELVES,  CAME TO SICK CALLTHE DAY AFTER THE EVENT. AND
BECAUSE NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOWTHAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE STILL
A FEATURE OF THE BATTLEFIELD,THE DOCTORS WERE NOT
ANTICIPATING THE CASUALTIES ANDWHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY LOOKED AT
OTHER POTENTIAL CAUSES
DEHYDRATION, SUNBURN,EXHAUSTION.
>> Stephen: LACTOSE INTOLERANCE.SOMETHING ELSE.
(LAUGHTER)AS A RESULT, DID THEY NOT GET
PROPER MEDICAL CARE?
>> MANY DID NOT.
SOME WERE NEGLECTED CARE.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THEPENTAGON'S RESPONSE SO FAR?
>> THE PENTAGON'S RESPONSE ISI'M NOT WORKING IN WASHINGTON SO
I DIDN'T WALK INTO THE PENTAGONBUT THE PENTAGON ESSENTIALLY
ACKNOWLEDGED THE FINDINGS ANDI'VE HEARD THEY'RE TAKING STEPS
TO MAKE SURE THE TROOPS WHO WEREEXPOSED ARE TREATED WELL AND
THERE'S SOME TALK THEY'RE GOINGTO LOOK AT THE PURPLE HEARTS AND
THE SOLDIERS WHO DIDN'T RECEIVETHEM AND TRYING TO FIND IF
THERE'S A LARGER POPULATION OFEXPOSED VETERANS TO GET THEM
ENROLLED IN CARE.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
C.J. CHIVERS, THE SECRETCASUALTIES OF IRAQ'S ABANDONED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
