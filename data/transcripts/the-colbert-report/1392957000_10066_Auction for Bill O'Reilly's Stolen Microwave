>> Stephen:  THANK YOU SOMUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I JUST CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOUWHAT THAT MEANS TONIGHT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE GOTTO THANK YOU FOR THAT OUTPOURING
OF AFFECTION.
YOU KNOW I AM NOTHING WITHOUTYOUR SUPPORT.
BUT I NEED IT NOW MORE THAN EVERBECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE
MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN ME ANDMY BROADCAST LIFE PARTNER BILL
O'REILLY.
( LAUGHTER )LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU PAPA BEAR
IS AUCTIONING OFF THE NOTES FROMHIS HISTORIC SUPER BOWL
INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT OBAMAFOR THE VETERANS CHARITY FISHER
HOUSE.
JUST LOOK AT THOSE INTERVIEWNOTES.
NO OTHER FOX NEWS HOST DOES THATKIND OF PREP WORK.
SEAN HANNITY USES THE SAME NOTESFOR EVERY SHOW, HANITTY SMASH.
AND IT IS NO SECRET I IDOLIZEBILL SO I WAS INSPIRED TO
AUCTION OFF MY OWN PIECE OFO'REILLY-BILLIA.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT HERE ISTHE ACTUAL MICROWAVE OVEN I
STOLE FROM BILL O'REILLY'SGREEN ROOM, OKAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
ALL PROCEEDS OF THE MICROWAVEGO TO BENEFIT THE YELLOW RIBBON
FUND THAT HELPS SERVICE MEMBERSAND THEIR FAMILIES AND IT'S
FITTING, FOLKS.
THIS MICROWAVE IS JUST LIKE BILLO'REILLY-- IT'S A LITTLE OLD, A
LITTLE SQUARE, AND DOES NOT CAREWHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, SADLY, SADLY-- NOW, SADLY,BILL DID NOT SEE THIS AS AN
HOMAGE, BECAUSE RECENTLY PAPABEAR TOOK A SWIPE AT ME.
>> COLBERT, FRESH FROM HIS VISITTO THE WHITE HOUSE TO HONOR THE
FRENCH PRESIDENT IS MOCKING MYCHARITABLE EFFORTS TO THE FISHER
HOUSE.
DUBIOUS?
MIGHT BE.
TIP OF THE DAY, FISHER HOUSE ISA WORTHY CHARITY AND COLBERT
IS-- NOT GOING TO SAY IT.
>> Stephen:  GREATHUMANITARIAN?
STUD MUFFIN?
THE WIND BENEATH YOUR WINGS?
STOP ME WHEN I GET IT RIGHT.
BUT BILL, IF YOU'RE WATCHING,YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU REALLY
HURT ME.
AND IF YOU'RE NOT WATCHING, THATHURTS ME EVEN MORE.
I WASN'T MOCKING YOU.
I WAS CELEBRATING YOU.
JUST TAKING SOME OF THE WEIGHTOFF YOUR SHOULDERS.
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BEYOU TALKING  ABOUT HOW GREAT YOU
ARE?
FURTHERMORE, I WAS PROMOTINGYOUR AUCTION. AND, APPARENTLY,
IT WORKED BECAUSE AFTER IMENTIONED IT, THE BIDS FOR
BILL'S INTERVIEW NOTESSKYROCKETED TO $999,999,999, AND
THEN DROPPED DOWN TO $30.
APPARENTLY, BILL MADE THE ROOKIEMUSTAKE OF NOT GETTING VERIFIED
BIDS.
GOTTA DO IT, BILL.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW THAT"THEBONERANGER" MIGHT NOT BE A
SERIOUS BIDDER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BILL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
MEANWHILE, THE BIDDING ON MYMICROWAVE SHOT UP TO $98,000,
BEFORE DROPPING  BACK TO $3,100.
SEE, WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE$98,000 WAS NOT A VERIFIED BID.
HEY, HONEST MISTAKE.
COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.
BUT IT'S WORTH THAT MUCH.
A LOT OF HISTORY IN THISAPPLIANCE.
I USED IT TO MELT AN AL FRANKENACTION FIGURE, STERILIZE MY
BOXER SHORTS, AND BOMBARDSTYROFOAM CUPS WITH ENOUGH
RADIATION TO SPAWN A GIANTMUTANT CUP, WHICH I KEPT AT BAY
WITH A MASSIVE PACKET OFARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.
THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DO AT THEREPORT.
HARD NEWS.
SO GO TO COLBERT NATION AND BIDON THE MICROWAVE.
AUCTION ENDS THIS SATURDAY.
AGAIN, ALL PROCEEDS GOING TO THEYELLOW RIBBON FUND.
YOU COULD BE THE OWNER OF THISMICROWAVE SIGNED BY ME AND BILL
O'REILLY.
PLEASE, BILL, SIGN MY MICROWAVE.
( LAUGHTER )OTHERWISE, YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK
LIKE A REAL--NOT GOING TO SAY IT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
DREAM WEAVER.
