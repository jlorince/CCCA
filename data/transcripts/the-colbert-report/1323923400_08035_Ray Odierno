EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO MARK
THE END OF THE IRAQ WAR.
IT BETTER BE OVER.
OR YOU'RE SERIOUSLY AWOL.
PLEASE WELCOME GENERAL RAY
ODIERNO.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
GENERAL, THANKS SO MUCH.
HAVE A SEAT.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, IT SAYS I GOT TO GET THE
COLORS OUT.
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.
FLAG OF THE STATES.
FLAG OF COLBERT NATION.
SIR, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
>>
>> Stephen: REMIND EVERYBODY
WHO MAY NOT KNOW ALL THE CV, IF
I MAY.
YOU ARE THE 38th CHIEF OF
STAFF OF THE U.S. ARMY.
REMEMBER THE JOINT CHIEFS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE BIG.
PREVIOUSLY COMMANDED THE U.S.
JOINT FORCES COMMAND.
YOU WERE COMMANDING GENERAL OF
THE MULTINATIONAL FORCE IRAQ,
U.S. FORCES OF IRAQ,
MULTINATIONAL IRAQ.
YOU COMMANDED THE FOURTH
INFANTRY DIVISION.
AND THE LAST TROOPS WILL BE
COMING BACK FROM IRAQ BY
DECEMBER 31st.
IS THE WAR OVER?
>> THE WAR'S OVER, STEPHEN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> CROWD U.S.A. SAY, U-S-A,
U-S-A!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
WHAT IF HOSTILITIES BREAK OUT IN
IRAQ AGAIN?
>> WELL, AGAIN, WE DON'T FORESEE
THAT HAPPENING.
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE
IRAQIS WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE
THEIR PROBLEMS INTERNALLY.
THEY ARE A SOVEREIGN AND FOR THE
MOST PART A STABLE STATE NOW,
AND WE THINK THEY CAN HANDLE
THAT THEMSELVES.
WE DON'T SEE ANYTHING BREAKING
OUT HERE ANY TIME SOON.
>> OKAY.
I HEARD A LOT FROM THE BLAME
AMERICA FIRST CROWD OVER THE
LAST NINE YEARS.
ABOUT HOW THERE WEREN'T WEAPONS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND HOW THERE WAS
NO CONNECTION TO AL QAEDA.
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE THE
PURPORTED REASONS FOR THE WAR
WHEN WE FIRST WENT IN DIDN'T
PROVE TO BE TRUE, THIS IS THE
WAR THAT CRIED WOLF AND IT MIGHT
ACTUALLY KEEP US FROM GOING
AFTER ENEMIES IN THE FUTURE THAT
HAVE A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER?
>> I WOULD JUST SAY FIRST WE
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS WAS A
BRUTAL DICTATOR, AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO KILLED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE.
WE FOUND MASS GRAVES ALL OVER
IRAQ, AND I BELIEVE HE HAD A
HATRED FOR THE UNITED STATES.
I BELIEVE IF HE WAS GIVEN THE
OPPORTUNITY, HE WOULD HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO TARGET OR
SOMEHOW REPAY THE UNITED STATES
FOR OUSTING HIM FROM KUWAIT BACK
IN THE EARLY '90s.
SO I BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A
FACTOR OF INSTABILITY IN THE
MIDDLE EAST AND I THINK THE
MIDDLE EAST IS A MUCH BETTER
PLACE WITHOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN IN
POWER IN IRAQ.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU SAY...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO THE EMPLOYERS OF AMERICA
ABOUT OUR TROOPS WHO ARE COMING
HOME?
BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING HOME TO A
VERY TOUGH ECONOMY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SELL EMPLOYERS ON
HIRING VETERANS.
>> FIRST OFF I WOULD SAY YOU GET
SELFLESS SERVICE.
YOU GET SOMEBODY WITH INTEGRITY.
YOU GET SOMEBODY WITH HIGH MORAL
VALUES.
YOU GET SOMEBODY WITH A WORK
ETHIC.
YOU GET SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING
TO SACRIFICE AND PUT SOMETHING
BEFORE HIMSELF.
AND YOU GET SOMEBODY WHO
DESERVES THE THANKFULNESS OF
THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WERE
WILLING TO RAISE THEIR RIGHT
HAND AND DEFEND OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WHAT CHANGES FOR
YOU NOW THAT THE IRAQ WAR IS
OVER?
I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE KEEPING
YOUR HEAD SHAVED IN SOLIDARITY
WITH OUR TROOPS NOW ARE YOU
GOING TO LET YOUR GOLDEN LOCKS
GROW RIGHT BACK OUT BECAUSE YOUR
NICKNAME AT WEST POINT WAS
RAPUNZEL, WAS IT NOT?
>> I WISH I COULD, IN FACT, GROW
MY HAIR OUT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I
CAN'T, BUT DIDN'T WE MAKE A BET
THAT YOU SAID, WHEN WE FINALLY
COME INTO IRAQ, YOU WOULD LET ME
SHAVE YOUR HEAD ONE MORE TIME?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: NO.
NO.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: UNLESS THE
PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO APPEAR ON
THAT SCREEN BEHIND YOU, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECTED, YOU CAN GO TO
HELL.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION:
HOW MUCH BESTIALITY IS THERE IN
THE MILITARY, BECAUSE MICHELE
BACHMANN SEEMS INCREDIBLY
WORRIED THAT THE TROOPS ARE ON
HAIR TRIGGER?
>> WELL, STEPHEN, I WILL SAY
THAT I HAVE NOT WITNESSED ANY OF
THAT IN MY 35 YEARS IN THE
MILITARY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
THE TROOPS HAVE BEEN IN
AFGHANISTAN FOR 11 YEARS.
AFTER A WHILE THOSE GOATS HAVE
TO LOOK PRETTY GOOD.
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
>> Stephen: WELL I'LL PASS
THAT MESSAGE ON TO HER.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE APOLITICAL, BUT IS THERE ANY
CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD JUMP INTO
THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES?
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'D GO FOR
YOU.
COME ON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
RIGHT NOW.
COMMIT.
RIGHT NOW.
NEWT AND MITT, WHY NOT RAY?
>> I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT JOB
BEING THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE
ARMY.
>> Stephen: COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
SOUNDS GOOD THOUGH, RIGHTLE?
>> I LOVE WORKING WITH THESE
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, THESE GREAT
SOLDIERS WHO VOLUNTEER.
THAT'S MY PRIORITY.
WHEN I'M DONE WITH THAT, I WILL
RETIRE SOMEWHERE AND ENJOY THE
REST OF MY LIFE.
>> Stephen: I HOPE YOU'LL
RECONSIDER.
WOULD YOU STICK AROUND FOR ONE
LAST TRIBUTE TO THE TROOPS.
>> I WILL.
