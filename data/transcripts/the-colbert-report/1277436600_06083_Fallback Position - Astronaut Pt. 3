EVERYBODY.
VERY KIND OF YOU.
I MUST SAY.
FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN SHARING MY
INTENSE IMMERSION IN ASTRONAUT
TRAINING WITH YOU FOR THREE DAYS
NOW.
WHICH IS TWO MORE DAYS THAN I
TRAINED.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, TONIGHT I PRESENT THE
DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF MY
ATTEMPT TO BOLDLY GO WHERE MANY
MEN, QUITE A FEW WOMEN AND
SEVERAL CHIMPS HAVE GONE BEFORE.
THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FALLBACK POSITION: ASTRONAUT."
♪ HALLELUJAH ♪♪
PREVIOUSLY ON "FALLBACK
POSITION: ASTRONAUT," CAN I FIRE
UP A COUPLE MISSILES?
I'D LIKE TO BLOW SOME STUFF UP.
ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW?
HOW PARENT IS IT TO BE FABULOUS
IN SPACE?
AND NOW THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION
OF "STEPHEN COLBERT'S FALLBACK
POSITION: ASTRONAUT."
MY TRAINING COMPLETE, IT ALL
CAME DOWN TO THIS: COULD I LAND
THE SPACE SHUTTLE IN A CRISIS.
>> HI, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: HI, MARK.
>> THIS IS A SHUTTLE SIMULATOR.
WE'LL GIVE YOU A TEST ON LAUNCH
AND LANDING AND SEE HOW YOU DO.
>> Stephen: LET'S DO IT.
I'M READY TO GO.
JUST ONE QUESTION.
HOW DO YOU FLY A SHUTTLE?
FIVE WORDS OR LESS.
>> PITCH FORWARD.
>> Stephen: HOUSES GET BIGGER.
PULL BACK THE HOUSES GET
SMALLER.
GOT IT.
WE'VE GOT 1:20 TO LAUNCH.
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING INTO
SPACE, ARE WE?
I WOULD PREFER NOT.
TO I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS
THIS WEEKEND.
>> 40 SECONDS.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET THE
VAMPIRE DIARIES ON HERE?
>> 30 SECONDS.
>> Stephen: IS THERE AN
IN-FLIGHT MEAL?
>> SIX SECONDS.
FOUR, THREE, TWO...
>> HOUSTON.
[JEEP SCREAMING]
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALMOST 500
MILES AN HOUR AND WE'RE GOING
ALMOST STRAYING UP.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THIS IS LIKE MAGIC
FINGERS.
SOMEBODY PUT A BUNCH OF QUARTERS
IN THIS MACHINE.
20,000 FEET WE'RE GOING SUPER
SONIC.
SHOULD MY MICROPHONE BE GOING
THIS HARD INTO MY ASS CRACK?
>> WE'RE 100,000 FEET MOCK
THREE.
>> Stephen: THE SWITCH OVER,
THERE I'D LIKE YOU TO THROW.
WHAT DOES THAT DO IN
>> THAT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: GOOD.
THANK YOU.
>> WITH REGARD TO YOUR SUIT, MY
DAUGHTER HAS ONE OF THESE, AS
WELL.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
SHE'S AN ASTRONAUT?
>> SHE'S 12.
>> Stephen: A VERY, VERY BRAVE
12-YEAR-OLD.
I PAID $89.99 FOR THAT.
WHAT'S NOT REAL ABOUT THAT?
WHAT'S UP?
WHAT DID WE LOSE?
WHAT DID YOU TOUCH?
>> I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE NO ENGINE?
>> WE'VE GOT NO ENGINES NOW.
>> Stephen: HOUSTON, I HAVE
PAYLOAD IN MY PANTS.
>> I'M JUST GOING TO GET OUT.
>> THAT WOULD BE BAD.
>> I KNOW, BUT I'M JUST GOING
TO... I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUST...
WHERE'S THE EJECT BUTTON?
IS THERE A BUTTON I CAN JUST
FLIP?
>> YOU'RE FLYING BECAUSE YOU
GRABBED STICK TOO HARD.
>> Stephen: I'VE HEARD THAT
BEFORE.
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LAND
THIS THING.
>> Stephen: NO PROBLEM, MAN,
I'M ON IT.
>> PITCH UP ON THE STICK, PULL
UP TO GET THIS NEEDLE CENTERED
AND THEN TURN TO THE RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT TO FOLLOW
IT A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT.
NO NEED TO YELL.
IT'S A PRESSURE-FILLED
SITUATION, AND RIGHT NOW I THINK
I NEED ENCOURAGEMENT AND
POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT.
ARE WE GOING TO NEWARK, J.F.K.
OR LaGUARDIA?
>> AT 2,000 FEET YOU'LL SEE SOME
OTHER TRIANGLES COME OFF THE
BOTTOM.
>> Stephen: IGNORE THOSE?
>> FOLLOW THEM EVENTUALLY.
>> Stephen: FOLLOW THEM.
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHEN.
>> Stephen: THIS HAS ALL THE
GRAPHIC CAPABILITY OF AN
ASTEROID GAME.
GET UP THERE.
COME ON.
>> A LITTLE LEFT.
>> Stephen: COME ON, MOVE YOUR
BIG ASS AROUND.
COME TO PAPA.
RIGHT THERE.
WE PUT THE BISCUIT IN THE
BASKET.
HOUSTON ENDEAVOR, WE ARE...
>> YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
USUALLY PEOPLE CRASH.
>> Stephen: SPACE STATION,
HERE I COME.
♪♪
I HAD EARNED THE ADMIRATION OF
MY PEERS.
BY GIVING IT MY ALL.
[LAUGHTER]
BLOOD, SWEAT AND VOMIT.
ALL THIS WAS LEFT WAS TO MAKE IT
OFFICIAL.
>> THE COMMANDER, AM I AN
ASTRONAUT?
>> WE RANK OUR ASTRONAUTS
GENERALLY IN THREE CATEGORIES
WHEN WE'RE FIRST LOOKING AT
THEM.
HIGHLY QUALIFIED, QUALIFIED AND
NOT QUALIFIED.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> WE REALLY THINK YOU'RE A VERY
STRONG COMPETITOR IN ONE OF
THOSE CATEGORIES.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
WELL, ANY KIND OF ASTRONAUT.
>> WE'VE GOT REAL NAME TAG FOR
YOU.
IT SAYS NASA ON IT, STEPHEN
COLBERT.
LET ME PUT THAT ON.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
SO I'M AN ASTRONAUT NOW.
>> WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY...
>> [SIREN SOUNDS]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
