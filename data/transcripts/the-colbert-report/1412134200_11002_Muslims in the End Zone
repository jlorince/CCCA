WHOO!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU, NATION!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL, CRISP
FALL TUESDAY NIGHT HERE INNEW YORK CITY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AMSAMSON AND YOUR CHEERING IS MY
LONG HAIR!
THANKS FOR BEING HERE!
NATION, I AM A HUGE FAN OF THEGAME OF FOOTED-BALL.
EVERY SUNDAY, I INVITE MY BROSOVER, GRILL UP SOME BRATS, CRACK
A COUPLE OF COLD ONES, FORGET TOTAKE THE BRATS OFF THE GRILL,
BURN DOWN MY HOUSE, APOLOGIZE TOMY BROS, AND HOLD A VIGIL FOR
LENNY.
(LAUGHTER)SO NATURALLY, I'M ALL OVER THE
HUGE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDINGLAST NIGHT'S GAME BETWEEN THE --
OH, SHOOT -- I CAN NEVERREMEMBER THE TEAMS' NAMES.
LET'S SAY THE NEW ENGLAND...
BIG GUYS VERSUS THE KANSASCITY -- UH -- CHIEFS.
OH, THE NAME OF THE TEAM ISACTUALLY THE CHIEFS?
GOOD TO KNOW.
THANKS...
UH, BUDDY.
JIM?
>> N.F.L. REFEREES CALLING A15-YARD UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT
PENALTY ON CHIEFS SAFETY HUSAINABDULLAH FOR DROPPING TO HIS
KNEES IN PRAYER AFTER SCORING ATOUCHDOWN ON MONDAY NIGHT
FOOTBALL.
ABDULLAH'S A DEVOUT MUSLIM.
HE WAS PRACTICING THE SAJDA, ARELIGIOUS PRAYER.
>> STEPHEN: A MUSLIM PRAYER INTHE END ZONE.
AND EVEN MORE SHOCKING -- I WASALLOWED TO PLAY FOOTAGE WITHOUT
THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OFTHE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
SOMETHING'S VERY, VERY WRONG!
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WEREMUSLIM FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
HOW CAN THEY PLAY IF THEY'RE NOTALLOWED TO TOUCH PIGSKIN?
(LAUGHTER)WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
WE'LL HAVE TO SWITCH TO HALALBALLS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER
SCANDAL THAN A MUSLIM BEINGPENALIZED FOR HIS RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS -- THE N.F.L. SAID THEYSHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.
(LAUGHTER)THEY RELEASED A STATEMENT THIS
MORNING SAYING THAT THE REFEREE"IS NOT TO FLAG A PLAYER WHO
GOES TO THE GROUND AS PART OF ARELIGIOUS EXPRESSION AND, AS A
RESULT, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEENNO PENALTY ON THE PLAY."
NO PENALTY ON THE PLAY?
HOW ABOUT HOLDING...
THE WRONG RELIGIOUS BELIEFS?
(LAUGHTER)OKAY?
WE ALL KNOW FOOTBALL IS ACHRISTIAN SPORT.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PLAYS LIKE"THE HAIL MARY" AND "THE LATERAL
JUDAS."
AND, IN FOOTBALL, WE THANK ONLYJESUS.
TIM TEBOW  WAS SO GOOD AT IT, WESTARTED CALLING PRAYING
"TEBOWING."
THOUGH THESE DAYS, "TEBOWING"MEANS BAGGING GROCERY AT A
SAFEWAY.(LAUGHTER)
LET ME EXPLAIN THE NATION'S GAMETO YOU. FOOTBALL WORKS LIKE THIS
PLAYERS THANK JESUS AFTER EVERYTOUCHDOWN.
THEN WHOEVER WINS IS THE TEAMJESUS LOVED MORE.
(LAUGHTER)BY THE WAY, JACKSONVILLE
JAGUARS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUDID TO ANGER GOD, BUT
IT'S TIME TO APOLOGIZE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NOW WITH MUSLIMS IN THE END
ZONE, ALL THAT'S CHANGED.
DON'T GET ME WRONG -- I'M ALLFOR PITTING CHRISTIANITY AGAINST
ISLAM TO FIND OUT WHO HAS THEBEST GOD.
(LAUGHTER)MY MONEY'S ON THE J-MAN.
WHENEVER HIS ELECTROLYTES ARELOW, HE CAN TURN WATER INTO
GATORADE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WHERE DOES IT END?
HOW MANY OTHER RELIGIOUSCELEBRATIONS WILL WE BE FORCED
TO WATCH IN THE END ZONE?
DRUID PLAYERS PLANTING A TREE?
BUDDHIST PLAYERS RELEASING A BOXTURTLE?
SCIENTOLOGISTS GIVING THE OTHERTEAM A STRESS TEST?
BOTTOM LINE, THIS WILL--
(APPLAUSE)BOTTOM LINE, THIS WILL
COMPLETELY RUIN THE GAME OFFOOTBALL.
AND THAT JOB IS ALREADY FILLEDBY ROGER GOODELL.
