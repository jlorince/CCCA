>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE HAVE DISMISSED MITT ROMNEY AS AN OUT OF TOUCH
SUPERWEALTHY 1%ER WHO CAN'T CONNECT WITH THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.
BUT HE PUTS HIS PANTS ON LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
ONE LEG AT A TIME, RIGHT AFTER CONSULTING WITH A PANT STRATEGIST.
BUT MITT HAS FINALLY FOUND A WAY TO COMMENT TO THE COMMON MAN.
HUMOR.
ON A RECENT CONFERENCE CALL WITH WISCONSIN SUPPORTERS,
HE TROTTED OUT A FAVORITE SHAGGY DOG STORY AND THIS TIME IT DOESN'T INVOLVE
STRAPPING THE SHAGGY DOG TO THE ROOF OF HIS CAR.
JIM?
>> YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT MY FATHER GEORGE ROMNEY WAS PRESIDENT OF AN AUTOMOBILE
COMPANY CALLED AMERICAN MOTORS.
AND THEY HAD A FACTORY IN MICHIGAN.
HE DECIDED TO CLOSE THE VICTORY IN MICHIGAN AND MOVE ALL THE PRODUCTION TO WISCONSIN.
NOW LATER HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN.
AND I RECALL AT ONE PARADE WHERE HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STREETS.
HE WAS LEAD BY A BAND, THAT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE MICHIGAN FIGHT SONG IT ONLY
KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE WISCONSIN FIGHT SONG.
SO EVERY TIME THEY WOULD START PLAYING ON WISCONSIN,
ON WISCONSIN, MY DAD'S POLITICAL PEOPLE WOULD JUMP UP AND DOWN TRYING TO GET
THEM TO STOP BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN TO BE REMINDED THAT
MY DAD HAD MOVED PRODUCTION TO WISCONSIN.
>> Stephen: GOOD STUFF.
IT'S LIKE HE'S ON THE BLUE COLLAR COMEDY STORE, IF THE COMEDY WAS ABOUT LOSING BLUE
COLLAR JOBS.
I SAY MITT SHOULD SKIP THE STUMP SPEECHES AND DO A TIGHT 15 AT THE LAST FACTORY
RIGHT BEFORE SHUTTING IT DOWN AND MOVING PRODUCTION OVERSEAS.
IN FACT, I AM SO EXCITED THAT EVEN THOUGH MINOT A COMEDIAN, I AM GOING TO GIVE
YOU SOME FREE MATERIAL.
LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HELLO.
HELLO, PALM 3W5E67.
WHO HERE IS RICH, WHO HERE IS RICH?
ALL RIGHT, GOOD CROWD.
DOW EVER NOTICE, YOU EVER NOTICE HOW WHITE PEOPLE AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT.
YOU ALL EVER NOTICE THAT?
YEAH, LIKE, LIKE WHEN YOU FIRE A WHITE GUY, HE'S ALL LIKE, HE'S ALL LIKE THIS
HE'S ALL LIKE-- WHAT?
I HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE FOR 18 YEARS.
I HAVE THREE KIDS.
IT'S A WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
WHAT IN I GOING TO DO?
BUT WHEN YOU FIRE A BLACK GUY, HE'S ALL LIKE WHAT?
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 18 YEARS.
I HAVE THREE KIDS.
IT'S A WEEK BEFORE KWANZA,
WHAT AM I GOING DO?
RIGHT?
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT ONE?
THAT GO I GUY KNOWS WHAT HE HE'S TALK WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
ANYWAY, THAT'S MY TIME, HIP TI
