I SAY IF THE HOMELESS WANT TOEAT THEY SHOULD DO IT IN THE
PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN WHEREVERTHOSE PEOPLE LIVE.
AND THIS MONSTER CANNOT CLAIM HEDID NOT KNOW BETTER BECAUSE HE
WAS DOING ALL THIS OUT OF ACHURCH KITCHEN.
SO, CLEARLY, HE KNOWS WHAT JESUSSAID IN MATTHEW, "FOR I WAS
HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHINGTO EAT.
I WAS THIRSTY AND-- LOOK OUT!
THE COPS ARE HERE.
HIDE THE LOAVES AND THE FISHES!"
AND I AM GLAD-- THEY CAUGHT UPWITH HIM EVENTUALLY. AND I AM
GLAD TO HEAR THE POLICE USEDMAXIMUM FORCE TO TAKE THE PERP
DOWN.
>> ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERSCAME OVER AND SAID, "DROP THAT
PLATE, RIGHT NOW."
AS THOUGH I WAS CARRYING AWEAPON.

THE BEACH IS THAT INDUSTRY.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NEVER ONCE WENT TO SPRING BREAK.
BESIDES, FT. LAUDERDALE ISREALLY LOOKING OUT FOR THE
HOMELESS.
>> THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETYISSUE.
IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.
THE EXPERTS HAVE ALL SAID-- IFYOU ARE GOING TO SIMPLY FEED
THEM OUTDOORS TO GET THEM FROMBREAKFAST TO LUNCH TO DINNER,
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS ENABLINGTHAT CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS.
>> Stephen: YES, BY FEEDINGTHEM, ABBOTT IS CAUSING THEM TO
BE HOMELESS.
HE'S REALLY A FOOD PUSHER. ANDFOR DECADES,
THIS SERIAL OFFENDER-- I ASSUMEHE SERVES BREAKFAST--WAS
DOWN IN  HIS COOK LAB GETTINGPEOPLE HOOKED ON THE
PRODUCTS OR AS IT'S KNOWN BY ITSSTREET NAMES, GRUB,  NOSH, CHOW.
CHASING THE NUTRITIONAL DRAGON
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE SOADDICTED, THEY NEEDED THEIR FIX
THREE TIMES A DAY.
AND WITH HARDENED COOKS LIKEGRANDPA HERE, THESE HOMELESS
WILL JUST WANT MORE AND MORE.
THEY'LL COME TO EXPECT FOODWHENEVER THEY SEE HUMANS AROUND.
OH, THEY'RE SMART LITTLECRITTERS.
SOME OF THEM EVEN KNOW HOW TOPRY THE LID OFF A TRASH CAN.
SO, FT. LAUDERDALE, DO WHAT I DOAT THE END OF THE DAY-- TIE YOUR
HUMANITY IN A BAG, HANG IT IN ATREE.
THAT WAY THEY CAN'T GET AT IT.
