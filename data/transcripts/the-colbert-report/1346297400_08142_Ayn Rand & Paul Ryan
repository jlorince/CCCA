(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, FOLKS, WE TAPED THIS SHOW AT 7:30 SO I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF THE CONVENTION BUT TONIGHT IN
TAMPA THE LIBERTARIANS ARE HAVING THEIR MOMENT.
WE WILL HEAR FROM GREAT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS LIKE SENATOR RAND PAUL AND SEE AN
INSPIRING TRIBUTE TO HIS DAD RON.
SO SAD RON PAUL ISN'T AROUND ANYMORE TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.
(LAUGHTER) I'M SURE HE'S IN A BETTER PLACE-- LIKE ORLANDO.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, MORE IMPORTANTLY TONIGHT IS THE VICE CORRELATION OF VICE
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE PAUL RYAN,
THE MAN WHO HAS ELECTRIFIED THE PARTY BASE WITH HIS HOMETOWN DOWN-TO-EARTH WAY OF TELLING THE
POOR TO SUCK IT UP.
(LAUGHTER) NOW ONE OF THE KEY FIGURES WHO UNITES THESE SMALL GOVERNMENT CRUSADERS IS LIBERTARIAN
PHILOSOPHER AND LOST ADAMS FAMILY COUSIN AYN RAND.
(LAUGHTER) RAND IS THE MOTHER OF OBJECTIVISM, THE PHILOSOPHY OF RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST WHICH,
ACCORDING TO YOUR COLLEGE ROOMMATE MEANS IN ORDER FOR MAN TO ACHIEVE HIS HIGHEST POTENTIAL
THROUGH REASON HE MUST LEAD HIS (BLEEP) ALL OVER THE COMMON ROOM.
(LAUGHTER) BUT AYN RAND SAW HER MISSION AS SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER.
>> I'M CHALLENGING THE MORAL CAUSE OF ALTRUISM.
>> EVERY IMPORTANT MORAL LEADER IN MAN'S HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US
WE SHOULD LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
WHY, THEN, IS THIS KIND OF LOVE IN YOUR MIND IMMORAL?
>> IT IS IMMORAL IF IT IS A LOVE PLACED ABOVE ONE'S SELF.
>> IF A MAN IS WEAK OR A WOMAN IS WEAK THEN SHE IS BEYOND, HE IS BEYOND LOVE?
>> HE CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE IT.
>> Stephen: SORRY, FELLAS,
SHE'S TAKEN.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, THE POPULARITY OF RAND'S NOVELS LIKE THE FOUNTAIN HEAD
AND ATLAS SHRUGGED HAS SURGED RECENTLY WITH SALES OF HER BOOK SKYROCKETING SINCE PAUL RYAN
JOINED THE TICK.
JUST LIKE MITT ROMNEY'S NOMINATION BOOSTED SALES OF THE BOOK HE BASED HIS CAREER ON
"HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU." (LAUGHTER) AND PAUL RYAN IS A TRUE BELIEVER.
HERE'S HOW HE CELEBRATED RAND ON HER 100th BIRTHDAY.
>> THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED...
(LAUGHTER).
BY AND LARGE IS I HAD TO THINK OF ONE PERSON IT WOULD BE AYN RAND.
I GREW UP READING AYN RAND AND IT TAUGHT ME QUITE A BIT ABOUT WHO I AM AND WHAT MY VALUE
SYSTEMS ARE AND WHAT MY BELIEFS ARE.
IT'S INSPIRED ME SO MUCH THAT I... IT'S REQUIRED READING IN MY OFFICE FOR ALL MY INTERNS.
>> NOW REQUIRING AYN RAND FOR INTERNS FITS PERFECTLY WITH HER
MESSAGE THAT YOU SHOULD WORK FOR FREE AND THINK EXACTLY THE WAY YOUR BOSS TELLS YOU TO.
(LAUGHTER) AND YOU CAN SEE THE RANDAN INFLUENCE IN PAUL RYAN'S OWN
WORK OF ION RAN FAN FICTION, THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S JUST AS READABLE AS ATLAS SLUGGED.
(APPLAUSE) JUST AS GOOD AS ANOTHER LAS SHRUGGED.
HE REWARDS JOB CREATORS BY CUTTING THEIR TAXES AND TEACHES SOCIETY'S PARASITES
SELF-RELIANCE BY CUTTING HEALTH INSURANCE THAT WOULD TREAT THEIR PARASITES.
BUT JUST BECAUSE PAUL RYAN GOT INTO POLITICS BECAUSE OF AYN RAND REQUIRES HIS STAFF TO READ
HER AND USES HER PHILOSOPHY IN HIS BUDGET DOESN'T MEAN HE LIKES HER.
>> WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF AYN RAND?
ARE YOU AN AYN RAND DISSIGN?
>> I ENJOYED HER BOOKS, IT TRIGGERED MY INTEREST IN ECONOMICS.
LATER I LEARNED ABOUT OBJECTIVISM.
I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH IT.
IT'S AN ATISTIC PHILOSOPHY.
HER PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETHING I DON'T AGREE WITH.
>> SEE?
HE LOVED THE ECONOMIC IDEAS IN ATLAS SHRUGGED BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER THAT HE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE BOOK'S SUBTLE ANTIRELIGIOUS MESSAGES.
I MEAN, WHO COULD SEE THE ATHEISM BURIED IN SUCH CODED LANGUAGE AS "THAT DARK
INCOHERENT PASSION WITHIN YOU WHICH YOU TAKE AS THE VOICE OF GOD IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE
CORPSE OF YOUR MIND." (LAUGHTER) I MEAN... I MEAN, I'M PRETTY SURE.
I MEAN, SHE COULD BE A LUTHERAN.
(LAUGHTER) SO HOW IMPORTANT IS AYN RAND'S PHILOSOPHY SO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?
WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL ASK AUTHOR AND RAND EXPERT JENNIFER BURNS AND, IN KEEPING WITH RAND
PHILOSOPHY I WILL BE A COMPLETE JERK TO HER.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
