PLAYERS CONTROL THE BANKING
INDUSTRY.
I'VE HAD IT.
SORRY, I'VE HAD IT.
THE ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI
PRIMARIES WERE LAST NIGHT AND
THE STAKES FOR ROMNEY WERE HIGH
OR AS MITT WOULD SAY JUST THE
RIGHT HEIGHT.
BECAUSE IF HE WON EITHER STATE
HE COULD DISPEL DOUBT ABOUT HIS
APPEAL TO CONSERVATIVES AND I
WOULD HAVE TO START LOVING HIM
WHICH, OF COURSE, I HAVE DO AS
LONG AS I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE
BUT I DO BECAUSE AFTER A WEEK OF
CANDIDATES FORCING CHEESY GRITS
DOWN THEIR THROATS AND Y'ALLS
OUT OF THEIR THROATS THE DEEP
SOUTH HAS SPOKEN AND FOR ONCE
THE NATION COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT
THEY WERE SAYING.
>> RICK SANTORUM'S SURPRISE IN
THE SOUTH.
HE WINS THE ALABAMA AND
MISSISSIPPI PRIMARIES.
>> MITT ROMNEY WALKS OUT IN
THIRD PLACE IN ALABAMA AND
MISSISSIPPI.
>> IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT NONE OF
THE CANDIDATES CAN SEW UP IN
THIS NOMINATION BEFORE TAMPA.
>> IT MEANS A LONG, SLOW PAINFUL
SLOG TO THIS NOMINATION.
>> STEPHEN: LONG, SLOW AND
PAINFUL.
THAIRCHL YOU JESUS.
THIS IS GREAT.
THE DEMOCRATS HAD THE SAME
SITUATION WHEN THEY WON LAST
TIME IN 2008.
NOW REPUBLICANS GET THAT HILLARY
VERSUS OBAMA MAGIC MINUS ANY
WOMEN OR BLACK PEOPLE OR MAGIC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU, WHY ROMNEY
IS HAVING TROUBLE CLOSING THIS
DEAL.
WE CONSERVATIVES DON'T TRUST
HIM.
RICK SANTORUM IS RESONATING WITH
VOTER BECAUSE OF HIS
AUTHENTICITY.
HE ALWAYS SPEAKS OFF THE CUFF
WHICH IS WHY HIS SWEETERS DON'T
HAVE -- SWEATERS DON'T HAVE
SLEEVES.
HE BELIEVES AUTHENTICITY SHOULD
BE LEGALLY MANDATED.
>> I BELIEVE WHEN YOU RUN FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
YOU SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO READ
OFF A TELEPROMPTER BECAUSE ALL
YOU ARE DOING IS READING
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORDS.
>> STEPHEN: YES, IT SHOULD BE
ILLEGAL.
VOTERS CANNOT TRUST CANDIDATES
WHO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORDS
IN THEIR MOUTHS.
THAT'S WHY NO VENTRILOQUIST
DUMMY HAS BEEN NOMINATED SINCE
THE DARK DAYS OF CHARLIE
McCARTHYISM.
WE CANNOT STOP AT TELEPROMPTERS.
I REJECT ALL PREWRITTEN WORDS.
THAT'S WHY I'M AGAINST READING
BOOKS.
BOOKSBOOKS ARE A LIE.
WHEN IT READ THEM IT MAKES
THOUGHT SOUNDS IN MY HEAD LIKE
I'M THINKING THEM.
SANTORUM DOES NOT USE A
TELEPROMPTER GIVEN HOW RND
CONCERNED HE IS ABOUT
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS I'M PRETTY
SURE HE USED CUE CARDS.
WHO, JIMMY.
IT'S A FAMILY SHOW.
BLUR THE DIRTY PARTS.
NO, JIMMY THE DIRTY PARTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S PART.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE IN THE
NEWS BUSINESS, I NEVER USE A
TELEPROMPTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I TRY TO SAY THE SAME THING AS
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE IN THE
MONITOR.
I JUST FOLLOW HIS LIPS.
OKAY?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHILE HE TALKS I TRY TO SAY WHAT
HE IS TALKING.
HE GOES PRETTY FAST BUT I CAN
USUALLY KEEP UP WITH HIM.
HE SEEMS ANGRY RIGHT NOW AND I'M
ANGRY TOO.
WE HAVE FUN TOGETHER.
'S I GOOD GUY.
SEE YOU, BUDDY.
WHOO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BY THE WAY, I KNOW THAT HE IS A
LOT OLDER THAN I AM BUT HE'S A
GOOD GUY.
WITH SANTORUM'S WINS IN THE
SOUTH, WHICH IS GINGRICH'S HOME
TURF BY THE WAY SOME SAY IT'S
OVER FOR NEWT.
I THINK THE FORMER SPEAKER COULD
WIN OVER LOUISIANA V
