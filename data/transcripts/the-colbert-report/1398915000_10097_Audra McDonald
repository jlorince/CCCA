>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT
HAS WON FIVE TONYS.
JUST ONE MORE AND THAT WILLBE SIX.
PLEASE WELCOME AUDRAMcDONALD.
(APPLAUSE)AUDRA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING BACK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: I LOVE IT WHENYOU'RE ON THE SHOW.
>> I HAVE A GOOD TIME ONYOUR SHOW.
>> Stephen: I'M REALLYEXCITED ABOUT THE NEW SHOW,
LADY DAY AT EMMERSON'S BARAND GRILL, YOU PLAY BILLIE
HOLIDAY.
>> BILLIE HOLIDAY WAS ONE OFTHE MOST ICONIC JAZZ SINGERS
OF THE LAST CENTURY,BASICALLY.
AND THE SHOW TAKES PLACE INMARCH OF 1959, ABOUT FOUR
MONTHS BEFORE SHE DIED.
AND SHE WAS A BIT, SHE WASDRUG ADDICTED AND SHE WAS AN
ALCOHOLIC BUT SHE WAS ALSOAN AMAZING SINGER.
AND SO THE SHOW TAKES PLACEAS A CONCERT THAT SHE'S
TRYING TO GIVE RIGHT BEFORETHE END OF HER LIFE.
AND SHE TELLS STORIES ANDTRIES TO GET TO THE CONCERT
AND DOESN'T QUITE MAKE IT ATTHE END.
>> Stephen: HERE'S MYPROBLEM WITH THIS, OKAY.
IS THAT I HAVE SEEN YOU DO ACOUPLE OF THESE SONGS AND
YOU'RE TREMENDOUS.
BUT MY FEAR IS THAT YOU'REGOING TO DRAW YOUNG PEOPLE
INTO THE JAZZ LIFESTYLE WITHTHIS SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL
THING.
>> Stephen: NO, NO, BECAUSEJAZZ, I DON'T-- I DON'T GO
TO JAZZING.
BUT JAZZ LEADS TO JAZZCIGARETTES.
AND THEN SWINGING OF HIPSAND BOOGIE WOOGIE AND YOU
KNOW.
YOU'RE CORRUPTING THE YOUTHOF AMERICA.
>> ACTUALLY I THINK WHATWE'RE DOING WITH OUR SHOW IS
NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW, FORPEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW
BILLIE HOLIDAY AND LOVED HERMUSIC, THEY ARE GETTING A
CHANCE TO REEXPERIENCE HERAND HER MUSIC AND HER LEGACY
BUT ALSO FOR YOUNG PEOPLETHAT ARE COMING, THEY'RE
GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF AHISTORY LESSON ABOUT THE
PLIGHT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANSIN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS
LAST CENTURY.
>> Stephen: IS THEREANYTHING THAT YOU AND BILLIE
HOLIDAY HAVE IN COMMON.
BECAUSE SHE WAS A TORTUREDINDIVIDUAL.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU SEEM PRETTYHEALTHY.
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK I WASAS TORTURED AS BILLIE.
I, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTANDWHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A
SINGER AND BE NERVOUS ABOUTPERFORMING AND ALL THAT BUT
I DON'T NECESSARILY GO TODRUGS TO CALM ME DOWN.
I GO TO REESES PEANUT BUTTERCUPS IS MY THING.
>> Stephen: IT'S A SLOWERKILLER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: BUT IT WILL GET
THREW.
>> YES, YES.
>> Stephen: IT WILL DO THEJOB.
WHY DO WE, WHY DO WE REVERETHESE SINGERS?
HERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM I'VEGOT WITH THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
WE KEEP ON REVERING SINGERSWHO HAVE THESE DEMONS, WHO
DIE YOUNG.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM SOTHAT DRAWS US IN?
IT'S THE STORY BECOMES SOATTRACTIVE TO US.
>> OF COURSE IT DOES.
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW BECAUSEAS A SINGER SOMEONE LIKE
BILLIE HOLIDAY, YOU KNOW,ALSO SOMEONE LIKE AMY
WINEHOUSE OR WHITNEY HOUSTONWHO HAVE HAD ISSUES LIKE
THIS.
THEY WERE ALL SUCHINDIVIDUAL TALENTS.
AND SO DEEPLY CONNECTED WITHWHO THEY WERE AS PEOPLE.
AND THAT IS WHAT THEIR MUSICBROUGHT FORTH.
AND SO PEOPLE I THINK CANCONNECT TO THAT ON A REAL
SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SPIRITUALAND HUMAN LEVEL.
AND SO IT'S JUST ACONNECTION THAT HAPPENS.
AND SO THEY, LIKE TO SAYTHAT THEY ARE RAW IN A WAY,
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NERVEENDINGS.
THEY ARE JUST SORT OFCOMPLETELY RAW AND ARE
EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING AT AMUCH DEEPER LEVEL THAN WE
ARE SO THAT I GUESS WE DON'THAVE TO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> DOES THAT BOTHER YOU.
>> Stephen: WHY CAN'T WEHAVE A MUSICAL ABOUT AMY
GRANT OR ANNE MURRAY ORSOMEBODY --
>> LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THATWE SHOULDN'T HAVE A MUSICAL
ABOUT THEM AS WELL.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> MAYBE THERE COULD BE AFANTASY MUSICAL AMY GRANT, ANN
MURRAY AND BILLIE HOLIDAY.
>> Stephen: AND THEY ARE ATHROUPLE.
(LAUGHTER)WELL-- WILL YOU PLEASE-- ARE
YOU PREPARED TO DO SOMEJAZZ AT US?
>> I CAN THROW A LITTLE JAZZ,BILLIE CAN THROW A LITTLE
JAZZ YOUR WAY.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE APOWERFUL OPERATIC VOICE.
SHE HAS A VOICE THAT IS MADEFRAIL THROUGH TIME AND
ABUSE.
HOW DO YOU MAKE THATADJUSTMENT?
>> IT'S BEEN REALLYDIFFICULT.
I'VE BEEN STUDYING HER VOICEFOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF
NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOWTO BRING MY VOICE-- BECAUSE
HER VOICE IS SMALLER ANDDIDN'T HAVE A LARGE RANGE.
SO IT'S BEEN-- I'VE BEENLISTENING TO HER NIGHT AFTER
NIGHT AND STUDYING HER.
AND-- .
>> Stephen: POUNDING THE PEANUT
BUTTER CUPS.
>> POUNDING THEM HARD.
I SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE ACAT DURING THE DAY TRYING TO
IMITATE HER.
AND I TALK TO PEOPLE LIKEHER, YOU KNOW, I CAN TALK A
LITTLE BIT LIKE HER IF IWANTED TO.
>> Stephen: SURE.
>> MOTHER ABBOTT WOULD SAYTO YOU GOD BLESS YOU MY
CHILD AND BILLIE HOLIDAYMEANING THE SAME THING WOULD
SAY LIKE, "YOU'RE THE BEST(BLEEP) I EVER MET."
>> Stephen: I TAKE THAT AS ACOMPLIMENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH APERFORMANCE BY AUDRA
McDONALD.
