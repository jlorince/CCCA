(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
BEST-SELLING BOOK ABOUT
MORTGAGE BUNDLING.
I SAY WHAT IS A BOOK BUT PAPER
BUNDLING.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL LEWIS.
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.
TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO
YOU BEFORE THE INTERVIEW.
SIR, YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF MANY
THINGS.
THE BLIND SIDE AND NOW THE BIG
SHORT WHICH IS BEING RELEASED
IN PAPERBACK.
GREAT BOOK.
HAVEN'T READ IT.
I DON'T THINK I NEED TO.
BECAUSE THE DOW AROUND 12,000.
AND SOMEONE GOT HIS SALARY
TRIPLED AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND
WE HAVE FORGIVEN AND
FORGOTTEN.
WE HAVE AT LEAST FORGOTTEN.
WHAT WAS THERE TO BE UPSET
ABOUT, SIR.
>> IT IS IMPRESSIVE HOW GOOD
WALL STREET IS AT WHAT IT
DOES.
>> Stephen: THEY DO THAT THING
THEY DO WITH THE DOW.
THEY MAKE THE DOW THING MOVE.
THEY TAKE THE DOW AND THEY
CASH THEM FROM FOR DOW CASH.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?
>> WALL STREET, WHAT IT'S
SUPPOSED TO DO IS PUT TOGETHER
PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BORROW
MONEY WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN LEND
THE MONEY.
THEY SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS
FIGURING OUT HOW TO LEND MONEY
TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD NEVER
REPAY THE MONEY.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU DO
THAT?
>> BECAUSE IT PAID THEM TO DO
THAT.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES IT PAY
YOU TO GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE
WHO WILL NOT GIVE IT BACK.
>> YOU PRETEND THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO GIVE IT BACK.
>> Stephen: THEY PRETEND.
DON'T YOU GET BACK PRETEND
MONEY THEN?
>> THE PEOPLE IN THE END WHO
LENT THE MONEY GOT BACK
PRETEND MONEY BUT FOR A WHILE
EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE WHO LENT
THEM THE MONEY GOT THE PRETEND
MONEY.
>> WALL STREET JUST SITS IN
THE MIDDLE.
>> Stephen: GIVE ME SOME MONEY-
WILL GIVE IT TO THIS PERSON.
YOU GO LIKE THIS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
DO ANYTHING.
>> THEY TAKE A LITTLE BIT OUT
IN THE MIDDLE.
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW IT'S A
BIG PILE OF MONEY.
THEY TAKE A LITTLE SLICE OF
IT.
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT
IT'S QUITE A BIT.
THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT TURNING
YOUR MONEY INTO THEIR MONEY.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY'RE ALSO
AN ENGINE OF THE ECONOMY.
>> THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.
WELL, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE THE JOB
CREATORS.
THE TOP 2% AND THEY ARE THE 2%
OF WAGE EARNERS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THEY CREATE THE
JOBS.
THEY'RE THE SMALL BUSINESSMEN.
I MEAN, THERE IS A VERY SMALL
AMOUNT TO BE BUSINESSMEN.
WHATEVER.
THE WORD SMALL IS IN THERE.
>> THEY DID THIS THING AND
CREATED TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OF LOANS THAT WOULD NEVER BE
REPAID.
THOSE LOANS STILL HAVEN'T BEEN
REPAID.
THEY DISGUISED THE FACT THAT
THE LOANS WOULDN'T BE REPAID.
THAT'S HOW THEY GOT PEOPLE TO
LEND THEM MONEY.
IT CAN GET VERY, VERY
COMPLICATED.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS.
>> Stephen: I LIVE IT.
IT'S MY LIFE, MY FRIEND.
BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE SOMETHING
WORTHLESS....
>> LET ME FINISH.
>> Stephen: A LONG COMPOUND
SENTENCE HERE.
>> THEY'RE SO GOOD AT
DISGUISING THE LOANS.
THEY BOUGHT SOME FOR
THEMSELVES.
>> Stephen: WAITE.
THEY DISGUISED IT SO BADLY
THAT IT CAME BACK AND SAID, HI,
CAN WE COME IN?
THEY SAID, SURE, COME IN, MGS
FELLOW.
YOU LOOK LONELY.
THEY CAME IN AND THEY WENT...
ALL RIGHT.
>> ALL BECAUSE OF THIS THEY
WERE ALL BANKRUPT.
THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE NOT
ALL OUT OF BUSINESS IS THE TAX
PAYOR CAME IN AND SAVED THEM.
>> Stephen: OBAMA'S FAULT.
>> ACTUALLY BUSH WAS THE ONE
WHO DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
>> Stephen: A LONG TIME AGO.
CAN'T REMEMBER WHO WAS
PRESIDENT THEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHO CARES.
TWO YEARS AGO.
STOP LIVING IN THE PAST.
>> THEY STARTED... THE
GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM MONEY.
LOTS OF MONEY.
THE ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED
SUICIDE ONCE.
NOTHING HAS CHANGED ABOUT THE
ORGANIZATION.
>> Stephen: WE SENT IN THE
STOMACH PUMP.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THIS STORY IS
GETTING HAPPIER.
>> AND SO.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
>> NICKEL S IS WHAT YOU WANT
TO BUY.
>> Stephen: NICKELS?
LIKE THE NICKEL.
>> ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS WHO
MADE HIS FORTUNE BETTING
AGAINST THE COLLAPSE OF THE
SYSTEM HAS STARTED TO BUY
NICKELS BECAUSE THE NICKEL....
>> Stephen: A PHYSICAL NICKEL?
LIKE THE JEFFERSON NICKEL.
>> BECAUSE IT'S GOT THE METAL
CONTENT.
HE'S WORKED OUT THAT THE METAL
CONTENT OF THE NICKEL IS NOW
WORTH 7 CENTS.
IF YOU MELTED IT DOWN YOU
WOULD GET 7 CENTS.
SO IT'S A HUGE RETURN.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET
NICKELS?
>> HE CALLED HIS BANK AND SAID
I WOULD LIKE TO BUY 20 MILLION
NICKELS.
AND THEY SAID WE'VE GOT TO
CALL YOU BACK.
>> Stephen: I'VE GOT A GUM
BALL PROBLEM.
>> HE GOT A CALL FROM THE
FEDERAL RESERVE SAYING WHY DO
YOU WANT THESE NICKELS?
HE SAID I REALLY LIKE NICKELS.
>> Stephen: DID YOU GET THEM?
>> HE'S GOT THEM IN A
BRINGS....
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET 20
MILLION NICKELS?
WHAT DO THEY COME ON?
>> A PLANK LIKE IT'S A BIG
PLANK.
I'VE SEEN PICTURES OF THEM.
BIG PILES OF NICKELS.
>> Stephen: IT HAS TO WEIGH A
TON.
>> YEAH BUT IT'S WORTH A LOT.
>> Stephen: IT'S ILLEGAL TO
DESTROY U.S. CURRENCY.
YOU CANNOT MELT U.S. CURRENCY
DOWN.
THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW.
HE WILL DO BIG TIME.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT WILL STOP
HIM.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK NONE OF
THESE GUYS ARE EVER GOING TO
SEE ANY JAIL TIME?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: LET ME PUT THAT
ANOTHER WAY.
ARE YOU BULLISH ON SNOWBALL
FUTURES IN HELL?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
