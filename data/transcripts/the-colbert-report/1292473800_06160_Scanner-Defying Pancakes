>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT," EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" ).
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
IT'S RHYTHM LIKE THAT THAT MAKES
ME WANT TO DANCE.
NATION, IT SEEMS THAT NO MATTER
WHAT WE DO TO IMPROVE AIRPORT
SECURITY, TERRORISTS COME UP
WITH A NEW WAY TO RETERRIFY US.
FROM TURNING UNDERWEAR INTO A
BOMB TO FORCING TAYLOR SWIFT TO
APPEAR ON THE COVER OF "AMERICAN
WAY" MAGAZINE.
STAY STRONG, TAYLOR.
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF.
THERE I THOUGHT WE HAD LICKED
THE JIHADIS WITH THE NEW
FULL-BODY SCANNERS.
THOSE THINGS WILL GIVE A
TERRORIST SERIOUS BODY IMAGE
ISSUES, YEAH, LIKE 72 VIRGINS
ARE GOING TO SPEND ETERNITY WITH
THOSE LOVE HANDLES.
COME ON.
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS, FOLKS.
IT TURNS OUT THE T.S.A. SCANNERS
CAN BE FOOLED WITH PANCAKES.
( LAUGHTER )
YES.
LET ME EXPLAIN.
ACCORDING TO THE JOURNAL OF
TRANSPORTATION SECURITY, A
LARGE, IRREGULARLY SHAPED SENT
METER-THICK PANCAKE WITH BEVELED
EDGES TAPED TO THE ABDOMEN WOULD
BE INVISIBLE TO THIS TECHNOLOGY.
OH, MY GOD.
I JUST MADE AN IRREGULARLY
SHAPED PANTS-CAKE.
IT'S NO SURPRISE, IT IS NO
SURPRISE, FOLKS, THAT PANCAKES
HAVE JOINED THE GLOBAL JIHAD.
WE HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT THEY'RE
PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL
CONSPIRACY.
( LAUGHTER )
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THESE
PANCAKES WILL ALLOW LAW-ABIDING
CITIZENS TO HIDE OUR PRIVATE
PARTS FROM THE HUNGRY EYES OF
THOSE T.S.A. PERVERTS.
FROM NOW ON WE CAN USE
STRATEGICALLY PLACED PANCAKES TO
COVER OUR SAUCE -- SAUSAGE AND
EGGS.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT, TONIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM PROUD
TO INTRODUCE STEPHEN COLBERT'S
SCANNER-DEFYING PANCAKES.
SHAKE IT UP.
AND THEN POUR THE BATTER DOWN
YOUR PANTS, OKAY, AND THE
SCANNER RADIATION BRINGS THEM TO
A GOLDEN BROWN.
BY THE TIME YOU GET TO YOUR
SEAT, YOU'RE READY TO LEAN BACK,
UNZIP AND PULL OUT YOUR
FLAPJACK.
( LAUGHTER )
OH, MAN, THAT WOULD BE GREAT
COVERED IN SYRUP.
BUT I SHOULD PROBABLY SAVE SOME
FOR THE PANCAKE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MMM, MMM.
DAMP.
( LAUGHTER )
AND IF YOU LIKE STEPHEN
COLBERT'S SCANNER DEFYING
PANCAKES, TRY OUR WAFFLES.
THEY'LL GIVE YOUR SCANNER IMAG
