NATION, THEY SAY AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY.
THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR, I BOUGHT 365 iPHONES.
THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH DR. STEPHEN T. COLBERT, DFA.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
QUICK DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR.
I'M AN HONORARY DOCTOR OF FINE ARTS, SO MOST OF MY PATIENTS DO A PRETTY GOOD IMPRESSION OF "THE
SCREAM." AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS.
PRESCOTT: SEE WHAT EVERYONE'S SUING ABOUT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
FIRST UP, AGING.
>> OLD!
>> Stephen: THANKS.
FOLKS, WE'RE ALL SEARCHING FOR THE SECRET TO LONGEVITY.
ME, I'M NOT WORRIED.
BECAUSE ACCORDING MY MEDICAL HISTORY, I'VE BEEN ALIVE EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO PROJECT THAT FORWARD, AND I WILL NEVER DIE.
THAT'S MATH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOLKS, THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE STEPHEN COLBERT LIFESTYLE WILL ENSURE YEARS FROM
NOW YOU WILL BE SITTING PRETTY, ENJOYING FREE FOOD AT ALL YOUR FRIENDS' FUNERALS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
JIM?
>> CAN LOSING YOUR COOL ACTUALLY BE GOOD FOR YOU?
A NEW GERMAN STUDY FOUND PEOPLE WHO EXPRESS THEIR ANGER LIVE TWO YEARS LONGER ON AVERAGE THAN
THOSE WHO BOTTLE UP THEIR RAGE.
>> Stephen: YES, A GERMAN STUDY FOUND THAT EXPRESSING ANGER LEADS TO A LONGER LIFE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALTHOUGH, WHEN GERMANS EXPRESS THEIR ANGER, OTHERS TEND TO LIVE SHORTER LIVES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, I'VE LONG KNOWN RAGE WAS A LIFE SAVER.
I LEARNED IT FROM MY MENTOR RUSH LIMBAUGH BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT HIM YOU GOTTA ASK, "HOW
IS HE STILL ALIVE?"
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE IS NATURALLY BLESSED WITH SOUL-CHOKING BITTERNESS.
LUCKILY, THE GOOD FOLKS AT PRESCOTT HAVE AN EXCITING WAY TO INDUCE RAGE IN THE TERMINALLY
CALM. INTRODUCING: VACSA-TERNITY A WONDER PILL THAT WILL ADD YEARS TO YOUR LIFE IN A SINGLE DOSE.
NOW, TO ACCESS THE LIFE-EXTENDING CAPSULE SIMPLY TAKE THE PLASTIC OFF THE --
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK I (bleep) CHIPPED MY TOOTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.
THAT COMES UP, ALL RIGHT.
LIKE THAT.
OKAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY.

[ APPLAUSE ]
SIMPLY, PRESS CAP UPWARDS WHILE UNDERTURNING FLAP B.
INSERT PHILLIPS HEAD ALLEN WRENCH-- NOT INCLUDED-- AND TURN INTRA-CLOCKWISE WITH LESS THAN
TWO POUNDS OF (bleep).
OPEN UP.
GIVE ME MY PILLS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-TERNITY INCLUDE: ABDOMINAL FOOSBALL, ELBOW-BAGGINS, AND THE HUMPTY HUMP.
A.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, IF YOU USE VACSA-TERNITY AND LIVE FOREVER, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A STRONG
BODY AND A SHARP MIND!
SO, OUR NEXT SUBJECT: AGING.
>> OLD!
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: THAT IS STRANGELY FAMILIAR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAN HAS LONG SEARCHED FOR THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.
WE'VE TRIED IT ALL: POTIONS, PLASTIC SURGERY, WATCHING "BENJAMIN BUTTON" WHILE STANDING
NEXT TO A MICROWAVE.
IT'S GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, THERE'S NEW HOPE THAT WE CAN TURN BACK THE CLOCK.
>> SCIENTISTS NOW THINK THAT THEY FOUND HOW TO REVERSE EFFECTS OF AGING.
ACCORDING TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY, IF YOU GET A BLOOD TRANSFUSION FROM SOMEONE YOUNGER
IT COULD HELP IMPROVE LEARNING AND MEMORY.
>> Stephen: YES, THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG CAN HELP IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY, ALTHOUGH YOU WILL
REMEMBER ONLY XBOX CHEAT CODES AND TAYLOR SWIFT'S EX-BOYFRIENDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, THE STUDY'S AUTHOR, DOCTOR SAUL VILLEDA, CONNECTED THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF OLD AND
YOUNG MICE SO THEIR BLOOD COULD MINGLE, RESULTING IN A 20% INCREASE IN CONNECTIONS BETWEEN
BRAIN CELLS FOR THE OLD MICES.
ALSO KNOWN AS THE WORLD'S MOST DISTURBING EPISODE OF PINKY AND THE BRAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
APPARENTLY ABSORBING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG CAN REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AGING.
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS, OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE TO RESORT TO SOMETHING DISTURBING, LIKE EXERCISE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, IN LIGHT OF THIS BREAKTHROUGH, PRESCOTT IS PROUD TO INTRODUCE VACSA-TERN A
MEDICAL-GRADE YOUNG PERSON HARVESTED STRAIGHT FROM MY INTERN PROGRAM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NICE TO MEET YOU, VACSA-TERN.
>> IT'S JAY.
>> Stephen: SHHH.
NO NAMES.
MAKES IT CREEPY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
JUST FIND THE PRE-INSTALLED SPIGOT ON THE INTERN'S BACK.
AND FILL 'ER UP WITH YOUNG!
MMMMM, MMMMM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WANNA GO SKATEBOARDING! LOLS!
TWITTER!
SKINNY JEANS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW YOU FEELING, JAY?
>> NO ONE EVER CALLS ME!
WHERE ARE MY GLASSES?
HISPANIC PEOPLE STEAL!
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: QUIET, GRANDPA!
YOU'RE HARSHING MY BLOOD BUZZ.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU CAN GO NOW.
BUT STAY CLOSE, JAY.
I'M SO THIRSTY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-TERN INCLUDE TONGUE DEPRESSION, INTERCRANIAL NOUGAT, AND CRAFTMATIC ADJUSTABLE HEAD.
