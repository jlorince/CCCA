(APPLAUSE)
SENATOR WARREN, THANKS SO MUCHFOR COMING BACK.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET MESAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO
HAVE YOU BACK.
IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> AND I WANT TO REMIND YOUTHE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE
I DID NOT CALL YOU SENATOR,BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT A
SENATOR.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE WELCOMEFOR THE COLBERT BUMP.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: I WILL GET MYTASTE ON THE BACK END, NO
DOUBT.
OKAY.
SENIOR SENATOR FROMMASSACHUSETTS, FORMER
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR WHOCAME WITH THE IDEA FOR THE
CONSUMER FINANCIALPROTECTION BUREAU, ALSO
CHAIRED THE CONGRESSIONALOVERSIGHT PANEL OF THE $700
BILLION TARP PROGRAM AND YOUHAVE WRITTEN NINE BOOKS, THE
LATEST OF WHICH IS AFIGHTING CHANCE.
WHO HAS GOT THE FIGHTINGCHANCE HERE, SENATOR?
ARE YOU THE PERSON FIGHTINGOR IS AMERICA THE PEOPLE
FIGHTING.
>> WELL, A LITTLE OF BOTH.
LOOK I'M SOMEBODY WHO GREWUP ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE
MIDDLE CLASS. MY DADDY WAS AMAINTENANCE MAN
MY MOM WORKED A MINIMUM WAGE JOBAT
SEARS THERE WAS NO MONEY FORCOLLEGE.
>> DON'T YOU TRY TOOUTHUMBLE ME.
I WILL NOT BE OUTHUMBLED.
MY FATHER WAS AN APPALACHIANTURD MINER, OKAY.
>> GOT IT BUT HERE WAS THEKEY DIFFERENCE.
I GREW UP IN AN AMERICA THATWAS INVESTING IN KIDS.
IT WAS INVESTING IN PUBLICUNIVERSITIES IT HAD A HIGHER
MINIMUM WAGE.
IT WAS AN AMERICA THAT SAIDEVERY KID WOULD GET A
FIGHTING CHANCE.
AND THAT'S HOW WE BUILTAMERICA'S GREAT MIDDLE
CLASS.
THEN STARTING IN ABOUT THE1980s WE TURNED IN A
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
>> YOU MEAN WHEN REAGAN CAMEIN AND IT WAS MORNING IN
AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER)THE DIRECTION TOWARD
GREATNESS PRIDE.
>> YES, THAT IS THE RIGHTTIME, WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> SO WE ARE ON THESAME PAGE SO FAR.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HEHAD A COUPLE OF IDEAS.
THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT THEYWOULD FIRE THE COPS.
NOT THE ONES ON MAIN STREETBUT THE ONES ON WALL STREET.
>> THE ONES WHO WERESHACKLING CREATIVITY, AND
INGENUITY IN
OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
>> AND MAKING SURE THEBIGGEST FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY FOLLOWEDTHE LAW.
THOSE WERE THE COPS THEY GOTRID OF.
>> THE LAW THAT IS AVAGUE TERM, LAW.
ONE MAN'S LAW ISANOTHER PERSON'S REGULATION.
AND REGULATION IS BAD.
REGULATION STIFLES BUSINESSAND STIFLES
ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
>> NO, NO.
NO, SEE IF WE DON'T HAVESOME BASIC RULES THEN WHAT
HAPPENS IS EXACTLY WHATHAPPENED THEN.
AND THAT IS THE BIGFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MADE
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BYCHEATING PEOPLE ON CREDIT
CARDS, MORTGAGES.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN CHEATINGPEOPLE ON CREDIT CARDS.
YOU SIGN UP FOR A CREDITCARD, USE THE CREDIT CARD
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAYYOUR BILLS, IS THAT TOO
COMPLICATED FOR HARVARD?
>> OH.
>> SO YOU JUST ACCUSEDREAGAN OF SUPPORTING
CHEATING PEOPLE.
THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS.
>> LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUTTHIS.
IT WAS SUPPORTING HAVING THEREGULATORS LOOK THE OTHER
WAY.
WHILE THE BIGGEST FINANCIALINSTITUTIONS HID EVERY TRICK
AND EVERY TRAP POSSIBLE INCREDIT CARDS, IN MORTGAGES,
IN CHECKING ACCOUNT RULES.
AND THEY MADE BILLIONS OFDOLLARS DOING IT.
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEYLOADED UP ON RISK.
AND WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENEDBY 2008 WAS THAT THEY BROKE
THE ECONOMY.
THEY GOT BAILED OUT BY THETAXPAYERS.
THEY CONTINUED TO BREAK THELAW IN FORECLOSING ON
PEOPLE'S MORTGAGES.
>> BUT LET ME POINTSOMETHING OUT TO YOU.
WE GAVE THEM A TON OF MONEYFOR TARP, OKAY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE MADE $52 BILLION.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEGOVERNMENT MADE $52 BILLION
ON TARP.
WE MADE A PROFIT, THEINDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WHO
WERE BAILED OUT, WE LOST 7.5BILLION ON THOSE PEOPLE.
>> OH.
>> AREN'T YOU BACKING THEWRONG HORSE HERE?
THE BANK, THE BANKS GAVE USTHE PROFITS, THE MIDDLE
CLASS DOESN'T GIVE THEPROFIT BACK.
WHY ARE YOU WORKING SO HARDTO HELP PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
PAYING THEIR BILLS.
>> OH, SO -->> AGAIN THIS IS A LOT OF
FREELOADING I'M HEARING YOUREPORT.
IT IS JUST MORE SOCIALISM.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT THERE HASBEEN A LOT OF FREELOADING
BUT THE FREELOADING HAS BEENBY THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL
INSTITUTION WAS GOTBAILED-- .
>> WHO PAID US BACK.
>> THEY GOT BAILED OUT BYTHE AMERICAN TAX PAYERS,
WHO BROKE THE LAW AND WERENEVER HELD RESPONSIBLE.
>> BROKE THE LAW, WHAT LAWSDID THEY BREAK?
NAME ONE LAW THEY BROKE.
>> HOW ABOUT THE MORTGAGELAWS THAT SAID THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW CERTAINRULES WHEN THEY FORECLOSED
AGAINST PEOPLE'S HOMES.
AND WHAT THEY DID IN TEXAS,THEY SAID WE COULD SAVE A
LOT OF MONEY IF WE DIDN'TFOLLOW THE LAW.
THEY HAVE ADMITTED TO THATBUT HERE IS THE KEY PART.
NOBODY WENT TO JAIL FOR ANYPART OF THIS.
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN AMERICATODAY WHO GO TO JAIL ARE
REGULAR FOLKS.
BIG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONSGET OUT THERE, THEY LAUNDER
DRUG MONEY, THEY VIOLATE THELAW AND STILL NO ONE IS HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.
I THINK THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLYWRONG, EVERYONE SHOULD--
(APPLAUSE)>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I
WILL ASK YOU, JUST OUT OFPOLITENESS, OUT OF
POLITENESS DO NOT CHEER FORME IN THE MIDDLE OF HER
ANSWER.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU CANNOT-- THE REASON
WHY YOU CANNOT SEND THESEPEOPLE TO JAIL IS, HAVE
YOU EVER HEARD OF THEINVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET,
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THAT.
>> YEAH.
>> YOU CAN'T PUT HANDCUFFSON AN INVISIBLE HAND.
THE COPS CAN'T FIND IT SO IT'SUP TO THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE
MARKET TO SAY THIS IS THE WAYYOU MAKE MONEY IS TO --
>> YOU ARE JUST PUSHING THEENVELOPE.
WHAT YOU CALL BREAKING THE LAWI CALL PUSHING THE ENVELOPE.
>> WELL, YOU COULD PUTHANDCUFFS ON PEOPLE WHO PUSH
THE ENVELOPE.
WHEN THEY BREAK THE LAW THEYDESERVE TO HAVE HANDCUFFS
THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE.
NOW THIS IS-- (LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> I SEE HOW THIS WORKS.
THIS IS WHAT THIS BOOK ISALL ABOUT.
>> A FIGHTING CHANCE.
>> IT'S ABOUT WHOSE SIDE THEGOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE
ON.
>> OKAY.
>> IS IT GOING TO BE ON THESIDE OF THE LARGEST
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ANDTHE LARGEST BANKS ON WALL
STREET, THE ONES THAT CANHIRE A LOT OF LOBBYISTS AND
LAWYERS, OR IS IT GOING TO
BE ON THE SIDE OF REALPEOPLE.
YOU KNOW WE-- (APPLAUSE)
>> WE CAN'T HAVE CAPITALISM IFTHERE AREN'T RULES.
NOBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TOSTEAL YOUR PURSE ON MAIN
STREET OR BE ABLE TO STEALYOUR PENSION ON WALL STREET.
>> THE OBVIOUS QUESTION ISARE YOU RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT?
(LAUGHTER)>> NO, I'M NOT RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
>> YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FORPRESIDENT, OKAY.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOT RUNNING.
A LONG TIME BETWEEN NOW AND2016.
>> I'M NOT RUNNING FORPRESIDENT.
>> YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FORPRESIDENT, OKAY.
