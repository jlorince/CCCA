AND, FOLKS, I AM RIGHT NOW BEING
TOLD BY THIS PROMPTER THAT
THERE'S BREAKING NEWS IN THE WAR
ON TERROR.
JIM.
>> CANADIAN POLICE SAY THEY
FOILED A PLOT THAT HAD SUPPORT
FROM AL QAEDA TO DERAIL A TRAIN.
TWO MEN ARE UNDER ARREST.
U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE
F.B.I. WERE ALSO INVOLVED.
>> THE PLAN WAS TO BLOW UP A
BRIDGE IN CANADA WHILE A TRAIN
WAS CROSSING, A TRAIN WHICH
TORONTO AND NEW YORK CITY
COMMUTERS USE.
>> THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO THE
STRENGTH OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS
WITH CANADIAN AND AMERICAN LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
>> Stephen:  YES, THE ROYAL
CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE, OR
MOUNTIES, HAVE THWARTED AN
AL QAEDA-INSPIRED TERRORIST
ATTACK, WHICH IS QUITE A FATE
CONSIDERING HOW HARD IT IS FOR
THEM TO GO UNDER COVER.
FOLKS, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A
WORD TO OUR FRIENDS UP NORTH--
YOU CANADIANS ARE A BRAVE AND
HEROIC PEOPLE.
IF I HAVE SAID IT ONCE, THIS IS
THE ONE TIME I SAID IT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I-- I WANT
ALL MY MAPLE-BLOOD BROTHERS TO
KNOW THAT WE WOULD PUT IT ON THE
LINE TO PROTECT YOU IF THERE WAS
ANYONE WHO DISLIKED YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
SO THANK YOU, CANADA.
THIS IS THE GREATEST GIFT YOU
HAVE GIVEN OUR COUNTRY SINCE
YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE PROVIDING
A PLAUSIBLE PLACE FOR OUR
NONEXISTENT GIRLFRIENDS TO BE
FROM.
( LAUGHTER )
AND I AM NOT-- I AM NOT THE ONLY
NEWSMAN SHOWING CANADA THE
PROPER RESPECT, SHEP.
>> LET'S GET THE DETAILS.
IN ENGLISH AND IN FRENCH.
IT'S HOW THEY ROLL.
AND THEY'RE STILL SAYING HOLE
OVER THERE AND THEY'RE GOING TO
SAY HELLO FOR A LONG TIME.
THEY DO-- YOU KNOW, GOD LOVE
CANADA BUT THEY-- THEY-- THEY'RE
NOT GREAT AT THE TELEVISION.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  SHEP'S RIGHT,
THEY'RE NOT GREAT AT THE
TELEVISION.
THEY JUST WASTE TIME, UNLIKE FOX
NEWS WHICH TODAY HAD A LOT OF
GREAT FOOTAGE OF CANADIANS
WASTING TIME ON TELEVISION.
