(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WON AN
EMMY, A TONY, AND TWO ACADEMY
AWARDS.
IF HE'S NICE, I MIGHT LET HIM
TOUCH MY GOLDEN TWEET.
PLEASE WELCOME GEOFFREY RUSH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS SO MUCH, PLEASE, DON'T
GET UP FOR ME.
NOW, SIR, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO
THE MOVIE YOU'RE HERE TO PROMOTE
RIGHT NOW, STOCK?
IN JUST A MOMENT.
BUT FIRST I HAVE TO ASK YOU
ABOUT "THE KING'S SPEECH."
INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE,
OBVIOUSLY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I COULD NOT HELP BUT NOTICE AT
THE END OF IT, THOUGH, THE KING
STILL HAD THAT DEBILITATING
ENGLISH ACCENT.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT?
>> THAT'S A COLIN FIRTH PROBLEM,
I THINK.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
HE... HE SAID THAT THE STUTTER
STICKS WITH HIM A LITTLE BIT.
DO YOU EVER FIND AS AN ACTOR
THAT YOU STICK IN THE CHARACTER
THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR SO LONG?
>> NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION IF
YOU'RE PLAYING CAPTAIN BARBOSA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> I CAN'T AFFORD THAT AMOUNT OF
SKIN PRODUCT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YES, THAT GUY DOES
NEED AN EXFOAL YANT.
>> (LAUGHS)
HE DOES.
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE FOURTH
TIME YOU'RE PLAYING CAPTAIN
BARBOSA AND THE NEWEST ONE,
WHICH IS "PIRATES OF THE
CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDE"
WHICH OPENS MAY 20.
ARE YOU A METHOD ACTOR?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT?
>> NO.
I'M A CHARACTER ACTOR AND I LIKE
TO THINK OF IT AS BEING
SOMETHING WHERE I GO INTO A
STATE OF PLAY.
BUT I... YOU KNOW, WHEN THE
CAMERAS STOP AND YOU'RE NOT...
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T GO...
>> ... BEING THAT PERSON.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T GO
"ARRG, I'LL BE AT CRAFT
SERVICES."
(LAUGHTER)
YOU DROP IT?
>> I ALWAYS SAY THAT.
THERE'S SO MANY METHOD ACTORS
THAT I REALLY ADMIRE.
THEY'RE ON 24/7.
THEY LIVE AND BREATHE THE
CHARACTER.
THEY DON'T LIKE TO DROP IT AND
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY FEELING
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GIVE
YOUR BEST PERFORMANCE AT THE
CRAFT SERVICES TABLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T SAVE IT
FOR THE CLOSE-UP.
>> AND WHEN THEY SAY "ACTION"
YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE... THE
CHARACTER'S BEING A BIT
DEPRESSED, YOU KNOW?
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE FOURTH
TIME YOU'RE PLAYING BARBOSA, AS
I SAID BEFORE.
ARE YOU AFRAID YOU MIGHT BE
STEREOTYPED AS A... 18th
CENTURY BUCCANEER?
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S THE
PERCENT OF... THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A PIRATE AND A
TERRORIST?
THEY'RE SEA TERRORISTS, RIGHT?
>> THEY ARE SEA TERRORISTS.
NOWADAYS THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE WHO
DOWNLOAD ILLEGALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
I THINK MANY OF MY AUDIENCE
MIGHT BE...
BE...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MIGHT BE BUCCANEERS.
>> I KEEP FINDING AND SO DO THE
PRESS KEEP FINDING SIMILARITIES.
THAT SAY "WILL YOU PLAY A LOT OF
MAD PEOPLE OR A LOT OF CRAZY
THEM?
" AND AT THE MOMENT, HAVING JUST
DONE "THE KING'S SPEECH" AND
"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN" I'VE
CROSSED THE LINE AND LEFT THE
PIRATE WORLD.
I'VE BETRAYED THE PIRATES AND
I'M NOW WORKING FOR KING GEORGE
II.
WHO'S THE GREAT, GREAT
GRANDFATHER OF COLIN FIRTH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ANGLING
FOR A KNIGHT HOOD?
>> (LAUGHS)
NO.
BUT THEN I ALSO MENTOR PEOPLE.
I'M MENTORING RYAN REYNOLDS IN
"THE GREEN LANTERN."
>> Stephen: ARE YOU IN "THE
GREEN LANTERN?"
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ONE OF
THE RINGS?
DO YOU FLY AROUND AND STUFF LIKE
THAT?
>> NO, I PLATO MA RAY.
I'D LIKE TO PLAY A CHARACTER
CALLED NEWT.
IT'S A COOL NAME, DON'T YOU
THINK?
>> Stephen: YOU COULD PLAY
NEWT GINGRICH IN THE BIOPICK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NOT SO MUCH HIM BUT THE ONLY
OTHER NEWT I CAN THINK SO THAT
YOUNG GIRL... REMEMBER THE FERAL
GIRL IN "ALIEN?"
>> Stephen: YOU COULD PLAY A
FERAL EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.
YOU'RE VERY...
>> (LAUGHS).
>> Stephen: YOU'VE WON YOUR
TONY, YOUR EMMY, AND YOUR OSCAR.
>> TIO.
>> AND YOU GOT THEIO.
WHY KEEP ACTING?
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE WON ACTING?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU'RE IN IT FOR THE AWARDS,
RIGHT?
THAT'S THE JOY.
THAT AND DOING THESE PRESS
JUNKETS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> YEAH, WE CAN'T WAIT.
THE MOMENT YOU GET THE SCRIPT
FROM THE AGENT YOU THINK "I
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE PRESS JUNKET.
JUST SITTING IN THE ROOM AND
DOING 16 OF THESE IN A ROW IS
GOING TO BE FANTASTIC!"
>> Stephen: THIS MOVIE IS 3D,
RIGHT?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IS IT HARDER TO DO
3D?
IS IT A BURDEN TO HAVE...
>> NO, I ALWAYS ACT IN 3D.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: GEOFFREY RUSH
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE MAN IS GEOFFREY RUSH.
THE MOVIE IS "PIRATES OF THE
