( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A WRITER FOR
THE "NEW YORKER" AND AN AUTHOR
OF A BIOGRAPHY OF RIN TIN TIN.
IT MAKES SENSE-- I USED THE "NEW
YORKER" TO HOUSE TRAIN MY DOGS.
PLEASE WELCOME SUSAN ORLEAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, NOW, YOU
ARE THE WRITER WHO WROTE THE
"ORCHID THIEF."
>> I AM.
>> Stephen:  EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT AND THAT WAS MADE INTO THE
MOVIE ADAPTATION IN WHICH YOU
WERE PLAYED BY MERYL STREEP.
NOW YOU HAVE THE BIOGRAPHY OF
"RIN TIN TIN: THE LIFE AND THE
"RIN TIN TIN: THE LIFE AND THE
LEGEND."
DO YOU THINK STREEP COULD PLAY
RIN TIN TIN?
SHE COULD.
>> I THINK-- YEAH, THE ACCENT--
I DON'T-- YES.
>> Stephen:  SHE CAN DO IT
ALL.
>> SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.
>> Stephen:  SHE CAN DO IT
ALL.
>> ALTHOUGH SHE WOULD BE HONORED
BY THE ROLE BECAUSE SHE'S A
GREAT ACTOR.
>> Stephen:  TELL ME ABOUT THE
DOG.
THIS WASN'T JUST A DOG ACTING.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  THE ROLE OF RIN
TIN TIN.
RIN TIN TIN WAS THE ACTUAL DOG.
>> RIGHT.
RIN TIN TIN STARTED-- HE WAS A
REAL DOG.
HE WAS A PUPPY FOUND ON A
BATTLEFIELD IN WORLD WAR I.
MOST PEOPLE KNOW HIM AS A
TELEVISION CHARACTER.
>> Stephen:  RIGHT, I REMEMBER
FROM THE 50S AND 60'S, THE ROW
RUNS OF THE BOY AND RIN TIN TIN.
>> RIGHT.
IT WAS RUSTY AND RIP MASTERS.
BUT WHAT WAS INCREDIBLE-- AND
THE REASON I ENDED UP DOING THE
BOOK WAS DISCOVERING THAT HE WAS
A REAL DOG FOUND IN A BOMBED OUT
GERMAN DOG KENNEL ON A
BATTLEFIELD IN FRANCE, WAS
BROUGHT BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES AND THIS WAS IN 1918.
AND THEN HE BECAME A HUGE SILENT
FILM STAR.
>> Stephen:  HOW DO YOU GO
FROM A DOG FOUND ON A
BATTLEFIELD TO A SILENT FILM
STAR?
BECAUSE WHO IS THE SOLDIER WHO
FOUND HIM?
>> A MAN NAMED LEE DUNCAN.
>> Stephen:  WAS HE IN
HOLLYWOOD ALREADY.
SN HOW DO YOU GET TO HOLLYWOOD
WITH YOUR DOG?
>> HE LIVED IN LOS ANGELES AND
HE SPENT ALL OF HIS TIME
TRAPPING THE DOG.
THERE WAS ANOTHER DOG WHO WAS
STARRING IN FILM AT THE TIME.
HIS NAME WAS STRONGHEART.
AND GERMAN SHEPPARD WERE A NEW
BREED.
MOST AMERICANS HAD NEVER SEEN
ONE.
SO THEY WERE A SENSATION.
AND A LOT OF SOLDIERS CAME BACK
FROM WORLD WORLD WAR I SAYING WE'VE
JUST SEEN THESE AMAZING DOGS.
SO LEE TRAINED HIM AND TRAINED
HIM AND ONE DAY THOUGHT, I THINK
HE'S GOT STAR POWER.
HE HAD BEEN FILMED CLEARING A
FENCE OF 11 FEET AT A DOG SHOW.
>> Stephen:  JUMPING OVER AN
11-FOOT FENCE.
>> YES, WHICH IS AMAZING.
>> Stephen:  IF HE ACTUALLY
CLEARED THE FENCE THAT WOULD BE
IMPRESSIVE, TOO.
>> MAYBE MORE IMPRESSIVE.
AND THIS CLIP OF HIM JUMPING
OVER THIS FENCE WAS USED IN A
NEUSS REEL AND I THINK THAT WAS
THE POINT WHERE WE BEGAN
THINKING MAYBE HE CAN GO TO
HOLLYWOOD.
HE WALKED UP AND DOWN SUNSET
BOULEVARD.
AT THAT TIME HOLLYWOOD WAS A NEW
INDUSTRY, AND YOU COULD
LITERALLY KNOCK ON DOORS AND
SAY, "LOOK, MY DOG IS REALLY
SMART AND TALENTED."
>> Stephen:  SO HOW BIG OF A
STAR ARE WE TALKING TALKING ABOUT WITH
RIN TIN TIN?
IF THIS STARTED AFTER WORLD WAR
I, AND I GROWING UP KNEW ABOUT
RIN TIN TIN, HE MUST HAVE BEEN
ENORMOUS.
>> HE WAS HUGE.
IN FACT HE WAS THE FIRST
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
AMERICAN STAR.
HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE BOX OFFICE
PERFORMER IN MUCH OF THE 20s.
>> Stephen:  HE WAS THE TOM
CRUISE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  OF THE 1920s
(  LAUGHTER  ).
>> AND HE WAS GOING TO BE
AWARDED THE FIRST BEST ACTOR
OSCAR.
>> Stephen:  THE FIRST BEST
ACTOR OSCAR TO THIS DOG
(  LAUGHTER  ).
>> YES.
BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE
ACADEMY, WHICH WAS THEN A VERY
NEW INDUSTRY, INSTITUTION, WHERE
THEY STARTED THINKING, WOULD IT
LOOK STRANGE IF WE GIVE OUR
FIRST BEST ACTOR OSCAR TO A DOG?
>> Stephen:  SO HE WON THE
VOTE AND DIDN'T GET THE OSCAR,
AND YET TOM HANKS HAS TWO
(  LAUGHTER  )
BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW HIS COAT IS
NOT SILKY AT ALL.
>> NO, NO!
>> Stephen:  SO LET'S SHOW THE
PEOPLE WHY RIN TIN TIN WAS SUCH
A BIG STAR.
JIM.
♪ ♪ ♪
>> Stephen:  THAT'S EXCITING
STUFF.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
I GOTTA ASK, IT WAS HARD TO TELL
FROM THE FOOTAGE.
WAS HE FIXED?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  HE WASN'T.
>> NO, AND IT'S NOT HARD AT ALL
TO TELL LATER IN THE FILM.
>> Stephen:  REALLY, HE'S GOT
A BIG PAIR OF SLINGERS?
>> HE-- HE HAD 44 CHILDREN.
>> Stephen:  HE HAD 44
CHILDREN!
NOW, DID ANY OF THOSE KIDS GO ON
TO BECOME STARS?
>> YES, WHEN HE DIED IN 1932,
WHICH, BY THE WAY, WAS SUCH A
BIG EVENT, THAT BROADCASTING
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WAS
INTERRUPTED WITH THE NEWS
BULLETIN TO REPORT THIS.
AND HIS SON, JUNIOR, THEN
STEPPED IN AND CARRY ON THE
TRADITION.
>> Stephen:  RIN TIN TIN JR.
>> RIGHT, AND THEN THE THIRD AND
FOURTH.
>> Stephen:  SO JUNIOR'S KIDS?
>> JUNIOR'S JUNIOR.
>> Stephen:  WELL, THAT'S
HOLLYWOOD.
IT'S WHO YOU KNOW
(  LAUGHTER  )
WAS IT HARD FOR RIN TIN TIN TO
GO FROM SILENT FILMS TO TALKIES?
BECAUSE I IMAGINE HE HAD A
GERMAN ACCENT?
>> YEAH
(  LAUGHTER  )
THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
>> Stephen:  IS THERE STILL A
RIN TIN TIN?
>> YUP.
>> Stephen:  ONE OF THE ACTUAL
DESCENDANTS?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  STILL ACTING?
>> YES-- WELL HE'S A
SEARCH-AND-RESCUE JOB.
HE'S RIN TIN TIN 12.
BUT THE LINE HAS CONTINUED AND
THAT'S PARTLY WHAT I THOUGHT WAS
AMAZING THAT FOR ALMOST 100
YEARS THIS DOG HAS BEEN A FIGURE
IN AMERICAN CULTURE IN ONE FORM
OR ANOTHER.
>> Stephen:  WELL, NOW IN BOOK
FORM.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SUSAN ORLEAN
( APPLAUSE )
THE BOOK IS "RIN TIN TIN: THE
LIFE AND THE LEGEND."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
