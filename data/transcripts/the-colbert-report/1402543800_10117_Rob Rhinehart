>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS INVENTED A DRINK HE SAYS CAN REPLACE
THE NEED FOR FOOD.
WE ALREADY HAVE THAT.
IT'S CALLED BEER.
PLEASE WELCOME, ROB RHINEHART.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
YOU'RE THE CULINARY MAN OF THE HOUR.
YOU'RE A 25-YEAR-OLD CEO OF SOYLENT THAT MANUFACTURES FOOD
PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO BE NUTRITIONALLY COMPLETE. AS OF
THE LATEST REPORTS, YOU HAVE $10,000 IN NEW ORDERS COMING IN
EVERY DAY.
LET'S LOOK AT THE STUFF.
HERE'S A POUCH.
IT'S CALLED SOYLENT AND IT'S A POWDER, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND IT'S AN OIL BLEND THAT GOES WITH IT.
>> THE BODY NEEDS IT AS WELL.
>> Stephen: WHY JUST NOT EAT FOOD?
AMERICANS ARE NOT LACKING IN FOOD.
>> AMERICANS ARE NOT LACKING IN CALORIES, THEY'RE LACKING IN
BALANCE AND AMERICANS HAVEA HIGH DEMAND FOR CONVENIENCE.
THE FOOD IS VERY CONVENIENT, NUTRITIOUS AND AFFORDABLE
IT FITS THE CRITERIA PEOPLEDESIRE IN THEIR STAPLE FOODS.
>> Stephen: OK, HERE IT IS. YOUMADE THIS UP FOR  US.
THERE IT IS.
WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS?
DID YOU SEE SOMEONE IN A COMA WITH A FEEDING TUBE AND YOU
THOUGHT I'LL HAVE WHAT HE'S HAVING?
>> I FOUND MYSELF FRUSTRATED INMY OWN LIFE, I WAS
EATING VERYPOORLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
>> WORKING FOR A TECH COMPANY, IWAS WORKING HARD AND ENJOYED MY
WORK AND WORKING ON COMPLEX PRODUCTS IN WIRELESS
COMMUNICATION AND FOOD WAS A HUGE BURDEN. GOING TO THE
GROCERY STORE AND COOKING ANDCLEANING AND DOING DISHES
AND DOING THE SAME WORK OVER ANDOVER, AND I WAS EATING POORLY
I THOUGHT WHY CAN'T WEOPTIMIZE IT? WHAT IF WE
MADE IT MORE EFFICIENT? WHAT IFWE DECONSTRUCTED FOOD AND
GOT DOWN TO THE CORE, THE REALPURPOSE AND BALANCED
IT AHEAD OF TIME BASED ONMODERN INFORMATION OF
NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND TRYTO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AND HEALTHY
AND AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE?
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU'LLMAKE AN EXCELLENT MAITRE D.
LET'S TRY A LITTLE BIT OF THISSTUFF.
A LITTLE BIT OF THIS, OK. THEREYOU GO.
NOW, IS THIS A SUPPLEMENT OR ISTHIS MY MEAL?
>> THIS IS A FOOD. IT HASEVERYTHING YOU BODY
NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY.
YOU CAN LIVE ON IT ENTIRELY IFYOU SO DESIRED.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING ON THIS?
>> IT'S BEEN THE PRIMARYCOMPONENT, ABOUT 90% OF MY DIET
FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.
>> Stephen: FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
OFF A PRIMARILY LIQUID DIET.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOUFORMED A STOOL, MY FRIEND?
>> IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL.
AS FAR AS THE BODY'S CONCERNED YOU'RE CONSUMING A TRADITIONALLY
WELL BALANCED DIET. IN FACT THISHAS THE FULL AMOUNT OF FIBER
THAT NOBODY IN AMERICA'SGETTING. SO IT'S QUITE REGULAR.
>> Stephen: SHALL WE?
HOLD ON, I'M GETTING NOTES OF --A LITTLE VANILLA-Y KIND OF TASTE
IS THERE FLAVOR IN HERE?
>> THERE'S VERY MINIMAL FLAVOR.IT'S DESIGNED TO BE VERY BROAD,
VERY NONSPECIFIC SO YOU DON'TGET TIRED OF CONSUMING IT
>> Stephen: AGAIN, YOU HAD MEAT NONSPECIFIC.
YES, OKAY.
SO -- >> OKAY.
HAVE I RUINED IT OR MADE IT BETTER?
>> IF YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE I THINKYOU MADE IT BETTER.
IT'S A STAPLE LIKE FLOUR.
I EXPECT IT TO BE A COMPONENT OFALL DIFFERENT FOODS STUFFS.
>> Stephen: THIS IS USED A LOTBY CODERS, I UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THEIR TERMINAL WHILE THEY'RE
CODING.
>> IT'S USED BY SORTS OF PEOPLE.
PEOPLE CAN FIT IT IN THEIR LIFESTYLE HOWEVER THEY SEE FIT.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEND MORETIME CODING YOU CAN USE IT AND I
THINK IT'S GREAT PEOPLE CAN SPEND MORE TIME FOR LEISURE
ACTIVITIES, RELAXING. THERE'S ALOT OF WORK AND COMPLEXITY AND
STRESS THAT GOES INTO FOOD.
>> Stephen: BUT THERE'S ALSOPLEASURE. FOOD IS PLEASURABLE
LIKE MELTED CHEESE, MY FRIEND.THIS IS AMERICA.
MELTED CHEESE.
>> I DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO GIVEUP CHEESE DIP.
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LIVE VERY LONGON  CHEESE DIP.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU'DLIVE  AMERICAN-STYLE.
SO HOW MANY OF THESE DO I DRINKA DAY?
>> IF YOU'RE HUNGRY THIS ISABOUT 2,000 CALORIES.
>> Stephen: THIS WHOLE JUG IS2,000 CALORIES?
HOW MUCH IS ITCOSTING ME?
>> NINE DOLLARS INCLUDING SHIPPING.
>> Stephen: LIVING ON NINE DOLLARS A DAY.
>> CHEAPER THAN FAST FOOD.
>> Stephen: I CAN GET A LOT OFNUGGETS FOR THAT.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GIVE UP NUGGETS.
BUT IT'S NOT VERY HEALTHY.
IT'S STILL EXPENSIVE.
NOT VERY BALANCED.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS IS MASSIVE.
JUST THE SHEER SCALE OF ANIMAL PROTEIN.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME OFF MEAT. IS THAT WHAT THE POINT IS?
IS THIS STEALTH-VEGANISM?
>> YOU CAUGHT ME THERE.
>> I DON'T WANT TO START WEARINGTHOSE SHOES THAT HAVE TOES IN
THEM AND GET WHITE BOY DREADS.
THAT'S THE NEXT THING THATHAPPENS WHEN YOU GO VEGAN
USE A CRYSTAL ROCK ASA DEODORANT.
>> MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTINGCONCERNED  ABOUT ENVIRONMENT AND
THAT'S IMPORTANT. TEDDYROOSEVELT SAID CONSERVATION
IS AS MUCH ABOUT DEVELOPMENT ASPROTECTION. TO DEVELOP
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW US TOALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON
THE ENVIRONMENT
>> Stephen: TEDDY ROOSEVELT ALSOSAID I'M GOING TO GO KILL AND
EAT A MOOSE.
MR. RHINEHART, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ROB RHINEHART, THE PRODUCT ISSOYLENT.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
