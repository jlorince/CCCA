(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO THE "REPORT", EVERYTHING.
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN ME TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) THANKS FOR JOINING US.
NATION, I HOPE YOU HAD A GREAT WEEKEND, MINE WAS A BLAST IN THAT I SPENT IT WITH PEOPLE WHO
LOVED TO BLAST THINGS.
I WAS DOWN AT THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING IN ST. LOUIS.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE DECADES-LONG GUN SHOW IN EAST ST. LOUIS.
(LAUGHTER) IT IS A FOUR-DAY CELEBRATION OF GUNS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
IT WAS A WALL OF GUNS RAFFLE AND ANTIQUE GUN SHOWCASE, A SEMINAR WITH TED NUGENT AND, FOR THE
KIDS, CARNIVAL GAMES LIKE "PRY THE GUN FROM CHARLTON HESTON'S COLD DEAD HANDS."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, THE REAL FIREPOWER CAME FROM ALL THE POLITICIANS
SHOOTING OFF THEIR MOUTHS.
A STAR-STUDDED LINEUP OF CONSERVATIVE GUN-LOVING REPUBLICANS AND MITT ROMNEY WHO,
TO BE FAIR, DOES OWN A PASTRY GUN SO HIS CHEF CAN DEFEND HIM AGAINST UNROSETTAED CAKES.
(LAUGHTER) BUT THE SPEAKER WHO LIT UP THE CROWD WAS NEWT GINGRICH WHO LAID
OUT HIS VISION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
>> IT IS ONE OF THE UNALIENABLE RIGHTS ELUDED ALLUDE IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE THE DECLARATION STARTS WITH "THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS."
IT DOESN'T GRANT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IT ACKNOWLEDGES THEIR PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
>> Stephen: YES, THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
(LAUGHTER) SO DO NOT EXPECT INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER YOUR GUNSHOT WOUND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND NEWT KNOWS WHERE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS COME FROM.
>> THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS COMES FROM OUR CREATOR NOT OUR GOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen: AMEN, BROTHER NEWT.
(LAUGHTER) GUNS ARE THE WORK OF OUR ON FISH YENT CREATOR.
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY PERFECTLY FIT INTO A HUMAN HAND.
(LAUGHTER) JUST ONE MORE REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE A GOD-FEARING NATION.
HE IS PACKING HEAT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT NEWT SAVED HIS NEWTLYEST IDEA FOR THE END.
>> I BELIEVE THE N.R.A. HAS BEEN TOO TIMID.
A GINGRICH PRESIDENCY WILL SUBMIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS A TREATY THAT EXTENDS THE RIGHT TO
BEAR ARMS AS A HUMAN RIGHT FOR EVERY PERSON ON THE PLANET BECAUSE EVERY PERSON ON THE
PLANET DESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM THOSE WHO WOULD OPPRESS THEM.
>> Stephen: WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VISION.
(LAUGHTER) WON'T YOU HELP NEWT BRING FIREARMS TO WAR-TORN AFRICA.
(LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE THIRD WORLD, FOLKS.
IN 2009 WEAPONS DEPRIVED ENGLAND HAD 41 GUN HOMICIDES.
BUT IF WE ARM EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY, I KNOW WE CAN PUT A ZERO IN THAT COLUMN.
(LAUGHTER) AFTER ALL, THAT SAME YEAR WE HAD OVER 9,000 GUN HOMICIDES.
THAT'S THREE ZEROS!
(LAUGHTER) BUT I MUST ADMIT, NEWT SAYING THE N.R.A. IS TIMID IS A BIT OF
THE POT BELLIED CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK.
BECAUSE HIS OWN PROPOSAL FOR ARMING EVERYONE ON EARTH IS KIND OF WEAK ON GUN RIGHTS.
THE MAN CALLS FOR A COLONY ON THE MOON AND YET NOTHING ABOUT LUNAR GUN RIGHTS?
(LAUGHTER) WHY, YOU'RE SAYING?
WHY WOULD I NEED GUNS ON THE MOON, STEPHEN?
MIGHT I REMIND YOU A CRESCENT MOON IS NOTHING BUT A FULL MOON WEARING A HOOD
