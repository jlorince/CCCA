( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUNDTHE WORLD.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
PLEASE, YOU'VE GIVEN ENOUGH ATTHIS POINT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RECHECKING YOUR CALENDARS BECAUSE
I WILL BE OFF THE AIR FORTHE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
BUT FOLKS THAT DOES NOT MEAN ICANNOT CALL IT RIGHT NOW.
SO WITH ZERO PERCENT OFPRECINCTS CARING, THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESWILL BE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR,
SCOTT WALKER.
CONGRATULATIONS, SIR!
WELL DESERVED.(AUDIENCE BOOS)
OOOOH, THEY LOVE YOU.
I'M CALLING THIS FORGOVERNOR WALKER RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE HE HAS PROVEN THAT HE ISSMARTER
THAN HE LOOKS, SOUNDS ANDGOVERNS.
HE KNOWS THAT IF YOU WANT TO GETELECTED IN THIS COUNTRY AS A
REPUBLICAN, YOU CAN'T JUSTAPPEAL TO WHITE PEOPLE.
YOU ALSO NEED TO APPEAL TOJEWISH WHITE PEOPLE.
>> A NUMBER OF HIGH-PROFILEREPUBLICANS WITH SIGHTS ON THE
2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID ARERETURNING FROM A WEEKEND IN SIN
CITY WHERE THEY ADDRESSED THEREPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION'S
ANNUAL SPRING GATHERING.
AMONG THOSE NAMES, WISCONSINGOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER.
>> GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER-->> HOPING TO GET THE BLESSING
AND FORTUNE OF CASINO MOGULSHELDON ADELSON.
>> Stephen: YES, THE WALKERCAMPAING WANTS THE BLESSING AND
FORTUNEOF SHELDON ADELSON, BUT HE'S NOT
GREEDY.
HE'LL SETTLE FOR THE FORTUNE.
AND WALKER'S AFFECTION FOR THEJEWISH PEOPLE IS GENUINE.
IN FACT, MADISON'S "THE CAPITALTIMES" HAS PUBLISHED A LETTER
DATING FROM WALKER'S TIME ASMILWAUKEE COUNTY EXECUTIVE, IN
WHICH HE TELLS A LOCAL JEWISHLEADER THAT HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO
DISPLAY A MENORAH CELEBRATINGCHANUKAH AT THE MILWAUKEE
COURTHOUSE, SIGNING IT "THANKYOU AGAIN, AND MOLOTOV."
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )NOW, WALKER PROBABLY MEANT
MAZEL TOV, WHICH IS YIDDISH FORCONGRATULATIONS, AND NOT
MOLOTOV, WHICH IS A BOTTLE OFGASOLINE WITH A LIT RAG STUFFED
IN THE NECK USED TO FIREBOMBTANKS.
( LAUGHTER )SO THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENCE.
THOUGH IN WALKER'S DEFENSE,EIGHT MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WOULD
MAKE FOR A VERY FESTIVE MENORAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THEY SAID THE GAS WOULD BURN FOR
ONLY ONE NIGHT.
NOW I THINK EVERYONE NEEDS TOJUST LAY OFF WALKER HERE.
HE'S STILL LEARNING.
HE HASN'T YET DEVELOPED THEDEEP CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING OF
THE JEWISH PEOPLE THAT I HAVE.
THERE IS NO GREATER FRIEND OFTHE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAN
YOURS TRULY, SO ALLOW ME TO SAYA WORD ON WALKER'S BEHALF.
JEWISH NATION, SCOTT WALKER'S AGOOD GUY.
HE'S A REAL MUNCH.
( LAUGHTER )OK, SO HE DOESN'T WEAR A YAMAHA
OR OBSERVE THE SHERBERT.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT HEWAS
READY TO DISPLAY THAT MINORAH.
I'M SURE, GIVEN THE CHANCE, HEALSO WOULD HAVE DISPLAYED THE
MAJORA.
AND WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUTA MAJOR JEWISH HOLIDAY HERE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS ISYOM TUPAC SHAKUR OR SHA-NA-NA
OR EVEN SUCROSE.
IF IT WEREN'T THE SAME TIME ASCHRISTMAS, NOBODY WOULD EVEN
TALK ABOUT HANA-KUNA MATATA.
IT'S JUST A FUN FAMILY HOLIDAYWHERE YOU EAT POTATO TCHOTCHKES
AND YOU SPIN THE DILDO.
DILDO, DILDO, DILDO, I MADE YOUOUT OF CLAY. AND WHEN YOU'RE
DRY AND READY...
LET'S ALL CUT SCOTT WALKER SOMESLACK.
THAT'S WHAT THE HOLIDAY SEASON'SALL ABOUT.
SOTO MY JEWISH VIEWERS, I, ITONIGHT
RAISE A GLASS OF LENNY KRAVITZAND SAY A HEARTY L'HEIMLICH
MANEUVER."
