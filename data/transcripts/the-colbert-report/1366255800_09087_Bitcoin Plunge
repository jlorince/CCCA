MALES.
BUT THERE IS ONE THING I DO
KNOW, FOLKS, IS THAT I AM
HEAVILY INVESTED IN SOMETHING
CALLED BIT COYNE.
NOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT BIT
COYNE IS, WANT TO BUY SOME BIT
COYNE?
NO?
ARE YOU SURE?
OKAY, JIMMY.
>> TELL THEM WHAT IT IS.
IT IS DIGITAL COINS TREATED
BETWEEN COMPUTERS.
THE WRITER OF THE PROGRAM
CREATED A FINITE AMOUNT.
LIKE GOLD, THE VALUE CHANGES
DAILY.
>> BIT-COIN IS GOLD FOR NERDS,
IF YOU WILL
>> Stephen: YES.
GOLD FOR NERDS.
OR AS WE NERDS CALL IT, MITHRIL.
STRONGER THAN STEEL.
MINED BY THE DWARFS MORIA UNTIL
THEY DUG TOO DEEPLY AND RELEASED
HER IN VEIN.
AND RELEASED DURIN'S BANE.
YOU KNOW.
BIT-COIN.
BIT-COIN JOINS A RICH TRADITION
OF MADE-UP CURRENCIES LIKE CAMEL
CASH AND THE EURO.
BUT INLIKE CURRENCIES RUN BY A
CABAL OF CENTRAL BANKERS,
BIT-COIN IS A PURELY ONLINE
CURRENCY WITH NO INTRINSIC
VALUE.
ITS WORTH IS BASED SOLELY ON THE
WILLINGNESS OF HOLDERS AND
MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT IT IN TRADE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
BIT-COIN HAS WORTH JUST BECAUSE
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ON THE
INTERNET HAVE AGREED THAT IT IS
WORTH SOMETHING.
LIKE PSY.
>> ESSENTIALLY THE ONLINE WORLD
IS THE CENTRAL BANK HERE.
JUST IMAGINE IF THE FEDERAL
RESERVE WAS TAKEN OVER BY
GAMESTOP.
NOW YOU CAN GET BIT-COIN BY THIS
PROCESS CALLED MINING IT WHICH
IS USING YOUR COMPUTER TO CRUNCH
A BUNCH OF NUMBERS OR SOMETHING
BUT YOU CAN ALSO BUY IT.
SO AS A THREUD INVESTOR, I
WAITED UNTIL JUST THE RIGHTÃ‘i
MOMENT.
>> I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TRYING
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BUY
BIT-COINS, I FIRST PUBLICLY
RECOMMENDED IT AROUND A NICKEL A
COIN.
NOW IT'S $133.
>> LAST THURSDAY BIT-COINS WERE
SELLING FOR ABOUT $130.
EARLIER TODAY THEY HIT AN
ALL-TIME HIGH OF $266.
>> Stephen: BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY.
BIT-COIN PLUNGING MORE THAN
$200 IN VALUE.
IT TOOK AN ABSOLUTE NOSE DIVE.
>> IT CRASHED.
BIT-COIN'S VALUE CRASHED.
>> BIT-COIN IS GOING BANANAS.
I'M READY TO VOMIT AFTER WHAT
HAD HAPPENED TODAY.
