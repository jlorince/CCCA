[LAUGHTER]
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
EVERYBODY.
IT IS NIGHT TWO OF MY SALUTE TO
THE VIKTORS OF THE IRAQ WAR.
AND WE ARE JOINED LIVE VIA
SATELLITE BY TROOPERS AT THE
FORWARD OPERATING BASE LAGMAN IN
AFGHANISTAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, YOU'RE IN AFGHANISTAN.
HAVE ANY OF YOU SEEN BIN LADEN?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, KEEP LOOKING.
AND WE'RE ALSO BROADCASTING LIVE
TO WOUNDED WARRIORS AT WALTER
REED HOSPITAL.
SAY HI, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
TROOPERS.
NOW, IF EVERYONE AT WALTER REED
WILL PLEASE JUST DROP YOUR
PANTS, I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A
MOMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, NOW, FOLKS, LAST NIGHT THE
AUDIENCE WAS ACTIVE DUTY
MILITARY.
TONIGHT IT'S ALL VETERANS.
GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND I AM THANKING THEM FOR THEIR
SERVICE WITH THE HIGHEST HONOR
THIS NATION CAN BESTOW -- FREE
T-SHIRTS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THEY ARE PRE-SHRUNK AND MADE THE
AMERICAN WAY -- IN HONDURAS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND JUST LIKE LAST NIGHT, I'M
GIVING THEM ALL HOT DOGS AND
FREE BEER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, LAST NIGHT I GOT SOME HEAT
FROM FEMALE SOLDIERS BECAUSE I
HAD ONLY SEXY BEER GIRLS, SO
TONIGHT I'VE GOT SOME BEEF CAKE
FOR YOU LADY VETERANS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S A SEXY GUY IN A HOT DOG
COSTUME.
SHAKE IT UP.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH!
WHOO!
NOW, NOW, EAT THE HOT DOG.
EAT THE HOT DOG.
EAT IT.
NO, OKAY, STOP, STOP, STOP,
STOP.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE EATING ONE
OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN.
YOU CAN GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ANYWAY, VETERANS, ON BEHALF OF A
GRATEFUL COLBERT NATION, I
SALUTE YOU.
AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE ENOUGH.
LET ME TRY THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO YOU'RE ALL CIVILIANS NOW, AND
YOU NEED TO REASSIMILATE INTO
AMERICAN CULTURE.
NOW, A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THE
SEVEN YEARS SINCE THE WAR
STARTED.
HERE'S WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED.
THIS IS A SNOOKI.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU ENCOUNTER A SNOOKI IN THE
WILD, DO NOT APPROACH HER.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU CAPTURE
FALLUJAH, YOU DO NOT WANT TO
TANGLE WITH THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
THE OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENT OF
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IS THAT
PRINGLES NOW COMES IN EXTREME
SCREAMIN' PICKLE.
OKAY.
REMEMBER, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE
FIGHTING FOR.
[LAUGHTER]
WHEN YOU SHIPPED OUT, FOOD
SCIENTISTS HADN'T YET FIGURED
OUT HOW TO MAKE A PICKLE SCREAM.
BUT NOW THROUGH GENETIC
ENGINEERING, I ASSUME THEY'VE
GIVEN PICKLES TESTICLES.
[LAUGHTER]
AFTER THAT THE SCREAMING IS
PRETTY EASY.
SO THAT'S IT.
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING ON MY HOW
TO HONOR VETERANS CHECKLIST.
I'VE THANKED YOU FOR YOUR
SERVICE RIGHT THERE.
I'VE BROUGHT YOU BEER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I HAVE HELPED YOU REASSIMILATE
AND I'VE GIVEN YOU A SEXY HOT
DOG.
ANYTHING ELSE?
OH, JOBS AND EDUCATION.
[LAUGHTER]
I CANNOT HELP YOU.
LUCKILY I KNOW A MAN WHO ALREADY
HAS.
PLEASE WELCOME THE ARCHITECT OF
THE NEW G.I. BILL, FRIEND OF THE
SHOW, FORMER SECRETARY OF THE
NAVY AND FORMER MARINE, SENATOR
JIM WEBB.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
I'M SORRY.
THEY USUALLY DON'T CHEER FOR ME
THAT HARD.
NOW, YOU'RE A FORMER SOLDIER,
FORMER MARINE.
>> MARINE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE NOW A
VIRGINIA SENATOR.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND POLITICS TO
THESE TROOPS WHEN THEY LOOK FOR
A JOB OR DO YOU HOPE THEY DON'T
GET THAT DESPERATE?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK THESE ARE THE KIND OF
PEOPLE THAT WE REALLY NEED
LEADING OUR COUNTRY, SO THOSE
WHO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD IN
POLITICS, WE WANT TO SEE THEM
DOING IT.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU'VE TRIED
TO HELP THE VETERANS ALREADY.
WHAT IS THE NEW G.I. BILL, AND
WHY DID WE NEED THAT?
WHY WASN'T THE OLD G.I. BILL
THAT CREATED THE GREATEST
GENERATION, WHY WASN'T THAT
ENOUGH?
>> WE NEED TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE,
THE NEXT GREATEST GENERATION,
THE SAME BENEFITS WORLD WAR II
PEOPLE HAD, PAY THEIR EDUCATION,
BUY THEIR BOOKS, GIVE THEM A
MONTHLY STIPEND.
THEY PULL THIS HARD LOAD.
THEY NEED THIS READJUSTMENT
BENEFIT TO GET THEIR HEADS
STRAIGHT AND MOVE INTO A NEW
FUTURE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET THESE GUYS
A JOB BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES
RANGE FROM ANYWHERE BETWEEN 10%
AND 15% OF RETURNING VETERANS
ARE UNEMPLOYED.
THE COUNTRY IS HURTING ALSO, BUT
WE OWE A SPECIAL DEBT TO THESE
PEOPLE.
SAY I AM HIRING.
WHY SHOULD I HIRE A VET?
KEEP IN MIND I ONLY HAVE UNPAID
INTERNSHIP.
[LAUGHTER]
I'VE GOT AN EXAMPLE.
I THINK I KNOW HOW PEOPLE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO GET THEIR RESUME TO
THE TOP OF THE STACK.
OKAY.
IMPRESS PEOPLE WITH YOUR
PREVIOUS JOB SERVICE, MAYBE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
WHEN YOU FILL OUT YOUR RESUME,
SAY, BEFORE I FLEW HALFWAY
AROUND THE WORLD AND TAKE ENEMY
FIRE TO PROTECT YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY'S FREEDOM...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
...I WORKED AT MEINEKE.
THAT MIGHT GIVE A LITTLE OOMPH
TO THE APPLICATION.
>> AFTER YOU WORKED AT MEINEKE,
AND THERE'S NO SHAME IN WORKING
AT MEINEKE, YOU STEPPED FORWARD
TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY, IT IS A
GOOD DEAL FOR YOU AS AN
EMPLOYER.
YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN
THROUGH SOME ADVERSITY, WHO
KNOWS HOW THE SHOW UP ON TIME,
WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK WITH OTHER
PEOPLE, AND WHO STEPPED FORWARD
AT A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN
OTHERS MAY NOT HAVE DONE THAT.
AND IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR YOU TO
HIRE THEM.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR,
FOR COMING.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: SENATOR JIM
