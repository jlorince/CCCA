[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOLD ON A MINUTE, FOLKS.
I HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK FOR MY
FAVORITE MID-SHOW SNACK.
JELLY BELLY JELLYBEANS.
I LOVE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN
COMBINE THEM TO CREATE NEW
FLAVORS.
FOR INSTANCE, YOU MIX MARGARITA
WITH PINA COLADA AND STRAWBERRY
DAIQUIRI AND YOU GET REGRETTABLE
SPRING BREAK.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THESE SUGARY LEGUMES HAIL
FROM THE SUBJECT OF MY 434-PART
SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT.
TONIGHT CALIFORNIA'S 10th,
THE FIGHTING 10th.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE 10th, THE 10th
CONTAINS THE TOWN OF WALNUT
CREEK, WHICH SETTLERS ORIGINALLY
CALLED "NUTS CREEK" BUT LATER
CHANGED IT TO AVOID CONFUSION
WITH THE NEARBY VILLAGE OF
TESTICLE FALLS.
[LAUGHTER]
MEANWHILE, IN NEARBY LIVERMORE
IS THE LIVER MOORE NATIONAL
LABORATORY, HOME OF THE WORLD'S
MOST POWERFUL LASER, AND MORE
THAN A QUADRILLION WATTS.
IT IS ABLE TO SCAN GROCERIES AS
FAR AWAY AS OHIO.
[LAUGHTER]
SPEAKING OF BRIGHT THINGS, THE
LIVERMORE FIREHOUSE CONTAINS THE
WORLD'S LONGEST-BURNING
LIGHTBULB, WHICH HAS BEEN
ILLUMINATED FOR OVER A CENTURY.
EVIDENTLY THE TOWNS LACK
SUFFICIENT PEOPLE OF ANY
ETHNICITY OR HAIR COLOR TO
CHANGE IT.
[LAUGHTER]
ON JUNE 18th, THE BULB WILL
CELEBRATE ITS 110th
BIRTHDAY, SO BRAVO.
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
AND WHO HAS THE BUTTERED POPCORN
JELLYBEANS TO REPRESENT NUTS
CREEK?
IT'S DEMOCRAT AND REJECTED
MICROSOFT WORD FONT JOHN
GARIMENDI.
I RECENTLY SAT DOWN WITH
CONGRESSMAN GARIMENDI IN HIS
WASHINGTON OFFICE.
CONGRESSMAN GARIMENDI, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> DELIGHTED TO BE WITH YOU.
>> CAN I CALL YOU GARY?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen: GARY, TELL ME
ABOUT THE FIGHTING 10th.
>> THE FIGHTING 10th IS ONE
OF THE MOST INTERESTING
DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA.
WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST AIR
BASES IN AMERICA, TRAVIS AIR
FORCE BASE IN FAIRFIELD.
>> Stephen: YOU ALWAYS HAVE A
BUDWEISER BREWERY IN YOUR
DISTRICT.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S UP.
WHAT'S UP, CONGRESSMAN?
YOU WANT THE TRY ONE?
WHAT'S UP.
>> I'LL PASS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
GOOD LUCK WITH REELECTION.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO
LIVE IN THE 10th DISTRICT?
>> TERRIFIC.
>> Stephen: DO YOU LIVE IN THE
10th DISTRICT, SIR?
>> NO, MY FRONT YARD IS IN THE
DISTRICT, BUT NOT MY HOME.
>> Stephen: I JUST ASKED YOU
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE
10th DISTRICT AND YOU SAID
IT'S GREAT, BUT YOU DON'T EVEN
LIVE THERE.
>> I DO REMEMBER THE AREA, I
JUST DON'T LIVE IN IT.
>> Stephen: SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU LIVED IN THE THIRD DISTRICT?
>> 36 YEARS.
>> Stephen: THE 10th IS A
NICE PLACE TO REPRESENT BUT YOU
WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE THERE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU AND YOUR RICH
BUDDIES IN THE 3rd CLEARLY
LOOK DOWN ON THE 10th.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: [IN ENGLISH
ACCENT" I DON'T MIND
REPRESENTING THEM, BUT I WON'T
WANT TO LIVE.
THERE BRADLEY, BRING ME MORE
CAVIAR.
>> ACTUALLY, THE 3rd IS NOT A
WEALTHY DISTRICT?
>> WHY DO YOU LIVE THERE?
>> JUST HAPPENS THAT THE
DISTRICT LINE IS...
>> Stephen: ON ANOTHER
SUBJECT, YOU OPPOSED PROPOSITION
8, CORRECT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO IF I WANTED TO
MARRY MAN, YOU'D SUPPORT IT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO IF YOU WERE GAY
AND IF I WERE GAY, WOULD YOU
MARRY ME?
>> I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE MY TYPE.
[LAUGHTER]
DON'T TAKE THAT AS AN INSULT.
>> Stephen: WHY SHOULD I?
WHY SHOULD I TAKE THAT AS AN
INSULT.
YOU GET THE COURAGE UP TO ASK
SOMEBODY TO MARRY YOU AND THEY
DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
IT.
THEY JUST SAY NO.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU THINK I'M FAT, JUST SAY
SO.
>> YOU'RE NOT.
>> Stephen: JUST SAY IT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HURT MY
FEELINGS.
>> I HAVE ANOTHER IMAGE IN MIND.
>> Stephen: IS IT ALLEN?
>> IT'S PATTY.
>> Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE
ISSUE.
YOU HAVE A STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL
RECORD.
>> YOU CAN CALL ME A "TREE
HUGGER."
>> Stephen: YOU EVER GO
FURTHER THAN THAT, A LITTLE
UNDER THE LEAF, OVER THE BARK
ACTION?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU SUPPORT
MAN-TREE MARRIAGE.
>> MAN-TREE MARRIAGE?
STOOP STEEP YES.
>> Stephen: YOU SUPPORT GAY
MARRIAGE, MAN AND MAN, WHY NOT
MAN AND A TREE.
WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE?
>> I THINK YOU JUST DID.
>> TREES ARE MEN, FLOWERS ARE
GIRLS.
MARRYING A TREE IS ESSENTIALLY
MARRYING A GAY PLANT.
I THINK I MADE MY POINT.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> YOU ARE ON THE HOUSE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE, CORRECT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>>
>> Stephen: YOU WERE GIVEN THE
OPTION TO SEE PHOTOS OF BIN
LADEN'S BODY.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?
>> I DIDN'T SEE THE PHOTOS AND
HAVE NO DESIRE TO DO SOME I'M
QUITE SATISFIED HE'S DEAD.
>> Stephen: CAN I HAVE YOUR
PASS?
>> NO, YOU CANNOT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I DO A
PRETTY GOOD JOHN GARIMENDI.
"I'M JOHN GARIMENDI.
I RUN THIS DISTRICT.
I DON'T LIVE IN IT.
YEAH."
>> I THINK YOU HAVE THE WRONG
ACCENT, BUT YOU'RE GOOD.
>> Stephen: THAT WAS ACTUALLY
MY DE NIRO.
[IN ENGLISH ACCENT] I'M JOHN
GARIMENDI HERE TO SEE THE
PHOTOGRAPHS.
BRING ME THE PHOTOGRAPH,
BRADLEY.
>> I THINK YOU'RE WAY OFF BASE.
>> Stephen: YOU SPONSORED THE
WEST COAST OCEAN PROTECT ACT OF
2011 PROHIBLGHTING THE COAST OF
DRILLING OFF THE COAST OF
CALIFORNIA, OREGON AND
WASHINGTON.
>> TRUE.
>> Stephen: YOU ALSO VOTED FOR
HOUSE AMENDMENT 773, ENDING THE
MORATORIUM ON DEEP-WATER
DRILLING RIGS IN THE GULF.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: SO YOU DON'T WANT
PEOPLE DRILLING OFF THE COAST OF
CALIFORNIA, BUT YOU VOTED TO
LIFT A MORATORIUM ON DRILLING IN
THE GULF OF MEXICO.
>> UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,
HIGH SAFETY STANDARDS, YES,
THAT'S GOOD.
>> Stephen: SO DRILL OFF
SOMEBODY ELSE'S COAST.
>> GULF OF MEXICO IS AN
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO EXPLORE AND
DRILL FOR OIL.
>> Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE AN OIL
SPILL?
WHY LET THEM DRILL THERE AND NOT
OFF CALIFORNIA.
>> BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAD OUR
OIL SPILL AND WE DON'T NEED TO
HAVE ANOTHER.
>> Stephen: [IN ENGLISH
ACCENT] DON'T DRILL OFF MY
BACKYARD.
DO YOU KNOW THE PHRASE "NOT IN
MY BACKYARD"?
NOW YOUR BACKYARD ISN'T IN YOUR
DISTRICT, SO DOES THAT APPLY TO
YOU?
>> NOT REALLY.
>> Stephen: LET'S GO BACK TO
SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT
BEFORE.
WHAT'S UP.
THANKS FOR COMING OUT OF THE
3rd TO REPRESENT THE 10th.
>> ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: PUT CALIFORNIA'S
10th UP ON THE BIG BOARD.
OH, LOOKS LIKE
