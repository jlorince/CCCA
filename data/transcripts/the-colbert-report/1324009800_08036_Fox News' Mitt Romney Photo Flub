(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU KNOW WHEN IT
COMES TO ACCURATE HARD
HITTING NEWS THERE WAS ONLY
ONE PLACE I TURN.
MYSELF.
THERE IS NO ONE I TRUST MORE
TO TELL ME WHAT I THINK.
BUT WHEN I CANNOT FIND A
REFLECTIVE SURFACE MY BACK
UP IS ALWAYS FOX NEWS ANCHOR
AND QUEEN OF NARNIA MEGAN
KELLY.
BUT EVEN SHE ON OCCASION
DROPS THE BALL.
>> SEVEN CANDIDATES READY TO
MAKE THEIR FINAL PUSH IN THE
HAWKEYE STATE, FUTURE
GINGRICH HAS SEEN A SURGE IN
THE POLLS BUT THAT SUPPORT
MAY BE FADING.
>> Stephen: DID YOU CATCH IT?
IT FLIES BY FOR ABOUT A HALF
A MINUTE, BUT FOR MITT
ROMNEY THEY USED A PHOTO OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IT IS AN EASY MISTAKE.
THEY HAVE THE SAME
POPULARITY AMONG
REPUBLICANS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW SOME OUT
THERE ARE SAYING THAT THIS
IS A SUBTLE ATTEMPT BY FOX
NEWS TO EQUATE THE MODERATE
MITT ROMNEY WITH THE
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.
BUT MEGAN KELLY WAS QUICK TO
CATCH THER ARE ROHR ABOUT AN
HOUR LATER, JIM.
>> WE WANT TO UPDATE YOU,
FOLKS, THAT WE EARLIER IN
THE HOUR WE PUT A
PHOTOGRAPHIC THAT WAS
INCORRECT IT IDENTIFIED MITT
ROMNEY WAY PICTURE OF BARACK
OBAMA.
AS IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE NOT
THE SAME MAN.
NOT PHILOSOPHICALLY, NOT
IDEAOLOGICALLICALLY, NOT IN
ANY OTHER WAY.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THEY
REGRET THE ERROR.
SO MUCH SO THAT I THINK THAT
THIS GUY IS QUITTING.
IT WAS JUST--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING IT WAS JUST A JUMP
EL FRAUD YEN-- SIMPLE FRAUD
YEN SLIP NAMED OF COURSE
AFTER SIGMUND FLAWED, I'M
I'M-- SIGMUND FRAUD, I'M
SORRY, JIMMY, PUT UP MY MOM,
I MEAN BREASTS, I MEAN FREUD,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JIMMY,
BLUR THE PENIS.
NOW FOR WHATEVER REASON FOX
NEW'S LIP FLUB HURT MITT
ROMNEY'S ROCK SOLID
CONSERVATIVE IMAGE THAT IS
WHY I AM CALL ON MEG KELLY,
NO, MEGAN KELLY, NO MEGAN
KELLY-- NO, MEGAN KELLY, NO,
MEGAN KELLY!
NO, MEGAN KELLY!
NO, MEGAN KELLY!
NO, MEGAN KELLY!
NO, MEGA-- MEGAN KELLY.
YES, MEGAN, THE CORRECTION
WAS NICE.
BUT TALK IS CHEAP.
TO MAKE IT UP TO MITT ROMNEY
YOU HAVE GOT TO ACCIDENTALLY
PUT UP THE WRONG PICTURE FOR
EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE.
MAYBE FOR RICK PERRY YOU GO
WITH GEORGE BUSH AS PLAYED
BY JOSH BROLIN.
RON PAUL, MAYBE A DRIED
APPLE DOLL.
GINGRICH, A BOB'S BIG BOY.
MICHELE BACHMANN, A STAERLTED
LEMUR, RICK SANTORUM, LET'S
SAY A VANILLA ICE CREAM CONE
THAT HATES GAY PEOPLE.
STILL, ANYONE OF THESE FINE
CANDIDATES COULD BE OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT.
YOU HEAR THAT, BARACK OBAMA?
YOU AND YOUR HEALTH
INSURANCE MANDATE ARE GOING
DOWN, BUDDY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
