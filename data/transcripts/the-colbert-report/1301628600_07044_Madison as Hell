THING.
FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
UNBELIEVABLE, WHAT IS
STOPPING GOVERNOR SCOTT WALK
CERTIFICATE STILL UNDER
ATTACK FROM PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES.
AND NOW APPARENTLY THE
ACTIVIST JUDGES ARE PILING
ON.
>> A WISCONSIN JUDGE IS
BLOCKING SCOTT WALKER'S LAW
REDUCING UNION'S COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING RIGHTS.
JUDGE MARYANN SUMI SAYS THE
LAW MAY VIOLATE THE STATE'S
OPEN MEETINGS LAWS.
>> Stephen: APPARENTLY IN
WISCONSIN LAWMAKERS MUST
POST A PUBLIC NOTICE 24
HOURS BEFORE VOTING ON ANY
LEGISLATION.
AND IN THE CASE OF WALKER'S
ANTI-UNION BILL THEY DIDN'T
DO THAT I THINK THEY JUST
STAPLED THE NOTE TO A BARN
CAT AND SET IT LOSE IN
KENOSHA.
SO DAIN COUNTY JUDGE MARYANN
SUNNI RESTRAINED AND ENJOYED
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FROM
ENACTINGING THIS YOU LA AND
TO ENACT THE LAW ACCORDING
TO THE WISCONSIN STATE
CONSTITUTION T MUST BE
PUBLISHED IN THE WISCONSIN
STATE JOURNAL, THE STATE'S
OFFICIAL NEWSPAPER.
BY THE WAY, THE STATE
JOURNAL'S HOROSCOPES ARE
ALSO LEGALLY BINDING.
WISCONSIN TAURUSES WHO DO
NOT RECONNECT WITH THAT OLD
FLAME WILL BE PROSECUTED
WITH THE FULLEST EXTENT OF
THE LAW.
WELL, LAST FRIDAY, FOLKS,
BRAVE REPUBLICANS DEFIED THE
JUDGE AND PUBLISHED THE LAW
ANYWAY.
JUST NOT IN THE STATE
JOURNAL.
I BELIEVE IT APPEARED ON A
DENNEY'S PLACE MAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT APPARENTLY
JUDGE HERE WON'T TAKE-- FOR
AN ANSWER.
YESTERDAY JUDGE WROOE OVER
HERE GOT HER ROBES IN A
BUNCH.
>> APPARENTLY THAT LANGUAGE
WAS EITHER MISUNDERSTOOD OR
IGNORED.
BUT WHAT I SAID WAS THE
FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF
2011 WISCONSIN ACT 10 IS
ENJOYED.
THAT'S WHAT I NOW WANT TO
MAKE CRYSTAL CLEAR.
>> WE WHERD YOU THE FIRST
TIME.
GOD, IT'S LIKE YOU ARE
WALKER'S MOM OR SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE NOT THE
BOSS OF HIM.
OHIO'S COURT TOTALLY LET
GOVERNOR KASICH DO IT, HE
CAN PUBLISH HIS LAWS ANY WE
ARE WANTS.
WILL HAVE HIS OWN GOVERNMENT
T WILL BE GREAT, WE'LL GO TO
THE KOCH BROTHERS AND DENY
LABOR RIGHTS AND THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A
CAMERO AND I HATE YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MORNING
JUDGE SUMI AGAIN STUBBORNLY
INSISTED THAT WHICH
WISCONSIN DOES IN FACT HAVE
A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT MUST BE
OBEYED EVEN IF REPUBLICANS
DISAGREE WITH IT.
AND IN A SHOCKER, REPUBLICAN
OFFICIALS SAID THEY WOULD
RECOGNIZE SUMI'S RULING.
THEN IN WHAT I THINK IS A
VERY CLASSY EXTENSION OF THE
OLIVE BRANCH, REPUBLICAN
OFFICIALS ALSO SAID THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY OF DAIN
COUNTY RECOGNIZES THAT JUDGE
SUMI IS A LEFTIST LIVING IN
DAIN COUNTY.
SHE GOES TO COCKTAIL PARTIES
HELD BY LEFTISTS IN DAIN
COUNTY, SHE SHOPS AT ORGANIC
GOURMET FOOD SHOPS RUN BY
LEFTISTS LIVING IN DAIN
COUNTY.
IF SHE WERE TO ENFORCE THE
LAW OF WISCONSIN SHE'D LOSE
HER FRIENDS.
REPRIORITIZE THE DISCUSSION
AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE
PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN OVER
FOIE GRAS AT COCKTAIL
PARTIES.
CLEARLY REPUBLICANS NO FAN
OF FOIE GRAS.
ALTHOUGH TH
