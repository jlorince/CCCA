(LAUGHTER)BUT, FOLKS, ALL IS NOT LOST.
THERE IS ONE LAST HOPE FORDEFEATING OBAMACARE.
>> THERE'S A MESSAGE WAR UNDERWAY AND THE TARGET IS HEALTHY
YOUNG PEOPLE.
SO IF YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T SIGN UPFOR OBAMACARE, FOR INSURANCE ON
THE INSURANCE EXCHANGES WHEN ITOPENS, WHEN THEY OPEN OCTOBER 1,
THE LAW IS GOING TO BE IN REALTROUBLE.
>> THEY NEED THESE PEOPLE.
THEY NEED THEIR PREMIUMS TOCOVER THOSE WHO ARE SICKER AND
HAVE HIGHER COSTS.
>> Stephen: YES.
OBAMACARE NEEDS THE PREMIUMS OFHEALTHIER PEOPLE TO COVER THE
COSTS OF SICKER PEOPLE.
IT'S A DEVIOUS CON THAT CAN ONLYBE DESCRIBED AS -- INSURANCE.
(LAUGHTER)SO, FOLKS, THE BATTLE COMES DOWN
TO WHO CAN WIN OVER THE YOUNG.
AND THE PRESIDENT IS TROLLINGFOR OUR KIDS ON THE INTERNET.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IS TWEETINGPHOTOS OF HAMSTERS AND PANDAS,
REBRANDING IT AS THE ADORABLECARE ACT.
>> IT'S A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNCALLED THE ADORABLE CARE ACT
FEATURES PICTURES OF THESE CUTELITTLE ANIMALS ALONGSIDE
MESSAGES OF SUPPORT FOR THEHEALTH CARE LAW.
THAT ONE, I BELIEVE, IS A MOUSE.
IT COULD BE A HAMSTER, I DON'TKNOW.
>> Stephen: IT COULD BE AMOUSE, IT COULD BE A HAMSTER, I
DON'T KNOW.
THANKS TO OBAMACARE, IT COULD BEA RAT THAT HAD GERBIL
REASSIGNMENT SURGERY.
(LAUGHTER)WHO KNOWS?
SICK STUFF.
SICK STUFF.
FOLKS, I AM SHOCKED THATDEMOCRATS ARE ENGAGED IN THIS
CRUDE EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION!
THEY'RE USUALLY NOT THIS GOOD ATIT.
(LAUGHTER)SO TONIGHT I HAVE STARTED A
CAMPAIGN I'M CALLING THEABOMINABLE CARE ACT FEATURING
UGLY ANIMALS REVEALING THE TRUEDANGERS OF OBAMACARE.
FOR INSTANCE, "I PICK MY OWNDOCTOR AND HE CUT OFF MY BALLS,
THANKS, OBAMACARE!"(LAUGHTER)
FORTUNATELY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONEOUT HERE FIGHTING BACK AGAINST
THE SCOURGE OF AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE.
THERE'S ALSO GENERATIONOPPORTUNITY, A POLITICAL GROUP
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FUNDED BY THEKOCH BROTHERS.
THE K-BRAHS!
BROS BEFORE H.M.O.s!
(LAUGHTER)THE KOCHS GO WITH YOUTH LIKE
PEANUT BUTTER GOES WITHENSURING.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT'S UP?
GENERATION OPPORTUNITY ISSPEARHEADING A CAMPAIGN
ENCOURAGING YOUTH TO OPT OUT OFOBAMACARE.
AS THE GROUP'S PRESIDENT YOUTHRAPS TO THE STREET KIDS "WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE IS,NO, YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED
TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE, YOUMIGHT HAVE TO PAY A FINE BUT
THAT'S GOING TO BE CHEAPER FORYOU AND BETTER FOR YOU."
YES!
IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAPER ANDBETTER FOR YOU!
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET TO PAY AFINE, YOU ALSO DON'T GET
INSURANCE!
IT'S LIKE RENTING INSTEAD OFBUYING AND THEN NOT GETTING A
PLACE TO LIVE!
(LAUGHTER)AND TO REACH THE YOUNG LINGS,
GEN-OP IS HOSTING COLLEGEFOOTBALL TAILGATE PARTIES AND
PASSING OUT BEER KOOZIES THATREAD "OPT OUT."
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.
BECAUSE WHY WOULD A DRUNKCOLLEGE STUDENT EVER NEED HEALTH
INSURANCE?
(LAUGHTER)(AUDIENCE REACTS)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK-- THOUGH I'MNOT SURE ABOUT THIS GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
