REMOVED FROM OFFICE BUT YOUNEVER RETIRED.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU FOUNDED THECARTER CENTER AND HAVE BEEN
TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLDWORKING TO ERADICATE DISEASE,
TRYING TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACYAROUND THE WORLD.
DO OTHER EX-PRESIDENTS CALL YOUUP AND SAY, PLEASE KNOCK IT OFF?
SOME OF US WOULD LIKE TO RELAX.
BECAUSE YOU INVENTED THE IDEA OFTHE POST-PRESIDENCY.
WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO DO THAT?
>> I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSETO DO.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE BORED?
I WAS ONE OF THE YOUNGERGRADUATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND
I HAD BEEN DEFEATED,INVOLUNTARILY RETIRED BY THE
ELECTION IN 1980 THANKS TO YOUAND OTHER PEOPLE THAT VOTED THE
WRONG WAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Stephen: I WAS ONLY 16 AT
THE TIME.
>> OKAY, OKAY.
AND A I'M A PROFESSOR AT EMORYUNIVERSITY AND HAVE BEEN NOW FOR
32 YEARS, BUT THAT, WRITINGBOOKS AND RUNNING THE CARTER
CENTER IS ABOUT THE ONLY THING IHAVE TO DO BESIDES RUNNING A
FAMILY.
I HAVE 12 GRANDCHILDREN AND 9GREAT GRANDCHILDREN, SO I HAVE A
BIG FAMILY, AND I HAVE TO TAKECARE -- I'M STILL GETTING
ACQUAINTED WITH MY WIFE ROSALYNNAFTER 68 YEARS.
[ CHEERS ]>> Stephen: DOES SHE EVER SAY,
YOU KNOW, FOR PETE'S SAKE,JIMMY, YOU HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT
FOR FOUR YEARS, KICK BACK ANDHAVE A BILLY BEER.

THEY'RE VERY VALUABLE, BY THEWAY.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOW PAYINGFOR MY COLLEGE EDUCATION.
OKAY, HERE'S MY BEEF WITH YOU.
WHY ARE YOU OUT THERE BUILDINGHOUSES FOR POOR PEOPLE?
HAVE YOU NOT READ AYN RAND?
WHEN YOU GIVE POOR PEOPLETHINGS, YOU ENSLAVE THEM TO YOUR
CHARITY, IT'S AN ACT OFVIOLENCE.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR MYSELF,JIMMY CARTER'LL DO IT FOR ME.
I CAN'T REACH THE REMOTE, JIMMYCARTER, GET IT FOR ME.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
>> I UNDERSTAND.
MY WIFE AND I HAVE HELPED BUILDHOUSES FOR 31 YEARS AND WE NEVER
BUILT A HOUSE THAT THE FAMILYTHAT LIVED IN THE HOUSE DIDN'T
WORK TWICE AS LONG AND TWICE ASHARD AS WE DID, SO WE REQUIRE
THEM TO WORK ON IT.
[ APPLAUSE ]AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO PAY FULL
PRICE.
>> Stephen: THEY HAVE TO PAYFOR THE HOUSE?
>> THEY HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE.
>> Stephen: OH, SO YOU'RE NOTSUCH A NICE GUY!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A NICE GUY!
>> WE DON'T CHARGE THEM ANYINTEREST.
THEY HAVE 20 YEARS TO PAY ANDDON'T HAVE TO PAY INTEREST.
WHAT BIBLE SAYS AS YOU WELL KNOWAS A CHRISTIAN THAT YOU DON'T
CHARGE INTEREST TO A POORPERSON, SO WE DON'T CHARGE ANY
INTEREST.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: NOW, HARRY
TRUMAN -- AS I SAID, YOU HAVEBEEN OUT OF THE PRESIDENCY 32
YEARS AND OUT IN THE WORLDWORKING, HARRY TRUMAN SAID THE
HIGHEST TITLE A PERSON CANACHIEVE IS THE TITLE OF CITIZEN.
HOW DOES IT COMPARE TOPRESIDENT?
>> IT'S SUPERIOR.
OBVIOUSLY, THE CITIZENS OFAMERICA ARE THE PRESIDENT'S
BOSSES AND CAN REMOVE HIM FROMOFFICE IF THEY CHOOSE, WHICH I
HAVE EXPERIENCED.
>> Stephen: UNLESS HE'S SPYINGON THEM, THEN HE KNOWS WHEN
THEY'RE COMING FOR HIM.

PRIVATE, YOU SEND SNAIL MAIL.

>> Stephen: THE N.S.A. TODAYSAID, NO, PRESIDENT CARTER IS
WRONG, WE ARE NOT MONITORING HISE-MAILS SO, GOOD NEWS, YOU CAN
START WRITING E-MAILS AGAIN ANDTHE N.S.A. WON'T LOOK AT THEM.

ANYONE IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen: SO WE'RE ALL FINE.
YES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ARELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT?
>> YES, A VERY FRIENDLYRELATIONSHIP.
>> Stephen: DOES HE CALL YOUFOR ADVICE?
>> NO.
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, I HAVEBEEN OUT OF OFFICE, AS YOU SAID,
30-SOMETHING YEARS AND I THINKWHEN HE WANTS TO GET ADVICE, HE
GETS IT FROM THE MOST RECENTPRESIDENTS, WHICH I DID.
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE ARELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENTS
WHO CAME BEFORE YOU?
BEFORE YOU WERE PRESIDENT,L.B.J. WAS GONE.
>> HE WAS GONE AND TRUMAN WASGONE.
I ONLY HAD TWO LIVING PRESIDENTSWHEN I WAS PRESIDENT, GERALD
FORD AND RICHARD NIXON, AND THEYHELPED ME WITH KEY ISSUES, MIGHT
SAY LIKE FRATERNITY BROTHERSHAVING GRADUATED FROM THE SAME
SCHOOL.

>> I WENT THROUGH A HAZING WHENI RAN AGAINST GERALD FORD, BUT
LATER, WHEN I DEFEATED HIM,SUBSEQUENT TO THAT, HE AND I
BECAME, ACCORDING TO THEHISTORIANS, THE TWO CLOSEST
FRIENDS THAT EVER GRADUATED FROMTHE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: ARE THEY RIGHTABOUT THAT?
>> THEY'RE RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHEN PRESIDENTOBAMA WAS INAUGURATED, THERE'S A
PHOTO OF ALL FIVE LIVINGPRESIDENTS STANDING WITH EACH
OTHER.
