FROM THE.
>> Stephen: HOW CLOSE IS THE
WEST, THE UNITED STATES, IS
ISRAEL TO WAR WITH IRAN, ARE
WE ON A PRECIPICE R WE ON,
ARE WE ON A CLIFF, ARE WE ON
A SOFT TRACK, MAYBE, ARE WE
ON A SLIPPERY FRONT STOOP.
>> SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE WE
ABOUT TO FALL OVER INTO,
WITH IRAN, BECAUSE IS
INEVITABLE RIGHT.
>> I'M NOT SURE BUT THERE IS
CERTAINLY A LOT OF
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE GOING
ON RIGHT NOW.
YOU HAVE IRAN TALKING ABOUT
CLOSING ITS STRAITS OF
HORMUZ, EVERYBODY GETTING
WORRIED ABOUT THE PRICE OF
OIL GOING UP, THE ECONOMY
BEING AFFECTED.
AND YOU'VE GOT ISRAEL
TALKING ABOUT A MILITARY
OPTION.
>> Stephen: S THERE'S NO,
THERE'S NO CHOICE, RIGHT?
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY
ARE SAYING.
IS THE SANCTIONS GOING TO
WORK, WHAT YOU'VE GOT, IT
SORT OF REMINDED ME OF WHEN,
I MEAN YOU AND YOUR GANG
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WERE
REALLY MARCHING THE COUNTRY
TOWARDS WAR WITH IRAQ.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT --
>> IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW-- .
>> Stephen: LEADING THROUGH
BRAVE VISION, SO WOULD YOU
RATHER HAVE SADDAM HUSSEIN
STILL IN POWER.
>> LISTEN, HERE IS THE
THING.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU STILL
HAVE SADDAM HUSSEIN.
>> I WOULD RATHER WE
HAVE-- YZ.
>> Stephen: YES OR NO, I AM
NOT GOING TO LET YOU WE ARE
RIGHT-- REWRITE HISTORY,
MADAME.
DO WE KNOW HOW CLOSE IRAN IS
TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON R THEY
LIKE THREE AREAS AWAY FROM
BEING LIKE FIVE YEARS AWAY
OR ONE YEAR AWAY FROM BEING
SEVEN YEARS AWAY.
>> WELL, YOU TELL ME.
SINCE 1990 OR 1992 PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN SAYING THEY ARING
TO GET IT NEXT YEAR.
LOOK, THE LONG FERR GOES ON,
THE MORE THE WEST AND ISRAEL
BELIEVES THAT IRAN IS SIMPLY
INDEX ORABLY MARCHING
TOWARDS A WEAPON.
IRAN KEEPS SAYING NO WE'RE
NOT.
>> Stephen: THEY JUST WANT
NUCLEAR POWER, THAT'S ALLS
WITH.
>> THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY,
BUT NOBODY BELIEVES IRAN.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ONE OF
THOSE PEOPLE THAT SAYS WE
TRUST WE SHOULD TRUST THEM.
>> NOBODY BELIEVES I RAN.
WHAT I THINK IS LOOK,
SANCTIONS HAVEN'T YET
WORKED.
THEY'RE BITING.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY BITING
BUT THEY HAVEN'T YET WORKED
IN TERMS OF CAUSING THEM TO
CAPITULATE.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD REALLY WORK IS DRIVING
A MOTORCYCLE UP NEXT TO AN
IRANIAN SCIENTIST CAR AND
PUT A MAGNETIC BOMB ON THE
BACK.
>> WHO DO YOU THINK IS DOING
THAT.
>> Stephen: MI GOING SAY
THAT PROGRAMS THE I REALIES
HAVE FOUND A WAY TO
WEAPONIZE THE DELIVERY MAN,
OKAY.
YOU KNOW, BUT IF THAT-- IF
THEY FEEL A NEED TO DO THAT,
DOESN'T THAT SAY THAT ITS
ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES THINK THAT THIS IS
GOING TOWARD A BOMB.
>> THEY CERTAINLY DO THINK
THAT.
THEY DON'T THINK THE IRANIANS
WOULD-- THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK
THAT WHICH IS WHY WE ARE AT
THIS POINT RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: AND THEY'RE
DIGGING DEEP BUNKERS TO DO
IT IN, THAT'S SUSPICIOUS TO
ME.
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES THAT
MEAN THEY COULD BE GETTING A
BOMB, BUT THEY COULD BE
FORMING AN ALLIANCE WITH THE
MOLEMEN.
>> WELL, THE MOLEMEN, I TELL
YOU, AND HOW TO GET TO THE
MOLEMEN THIS IS A BIG, BIG
WORRY, IS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO
TELL US ABOUT WHAT MIGHT
HAPPEN IN IRAN.
ONE OF THESE AREAS IS UNDER
A MOUNTAIN, UNDER A
MOUNTAIN.
AND HOW DO YOU GET TO LIFT
THAT MOUNTAIN.
>> Stephen: A NUCLEAR BOMB.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: YOU NEED A
NUCLEAR BOMB.
OBAMA SAID IT IN THE STATE
OF THE UNION.
EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE.
YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: AND THEY HAVE A
BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FROM
CONGRESS.
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY
USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> Stephen: WE TALKED ABOUT
IT, I'M SOME PEOPLE.
>> I KNOW, BUT SERIOUS
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU NOT
SEEN MY SANDALS, MADAME.
>> I WANT TO SEE THEM.
>> Stephen: THESE ARE VERY,
VERY SERIOUS SANDALS,
SERIOUSLY, OBAMA SAID
NOTHING'S OFF THE TABLE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND THEN HE SAID
BUT OF COURSE WE WANT TO TRY
PEACEFUL METHODS TOO.
AND CONGRESS WENT YEAH, YEAH,
PEACE, PEACE, PEACE, PEACE.
HE GOT THE OVATION FOR THE
POSSIBLE USE OF FORCE.
>> UH-HUH.
THERE'S NO CURRENCY IN THIS
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN A
PRESIDENTIAL YEAR FOR ANY
FLEXES.
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN
REVIEWED AHMADINEJAD.
>> AHMADINEJAD.
>> Stephen: YEAH, I CAN'T
PRONOUNCE T IS A DIFFICULT
NAME.
>> IT IS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO
SEE HIM, INTERVIEW HIM ANY
TIME SOON?
>> YOU KNOW, WE WOULD ALWAYS
LIKE TO.
HE TENDS TO SAY THE SAME
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
SO ONE INTERVIEW IS MUCH
LIKE ANOTHER INTERVIEW.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU JUST
INTERVIEWED HIM ONCE AND
JUST RUN IT FOUR TIMES.
>> WELL, I COULD.
I COULD.
>> Stephen: ASK HIM TO COME
ON HERE.
I WILL LET HIM SAY ANY CRAZY
THING HE WANTS.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE OF
THE CRAZY THINGS IS THAT
IT'S BECOME CRAZY THERE,
CERTAINLY SINCE I WAS THERE
IN 2009.
YOU REMEMBER, THE PEOPLE OF
IRAN CAME OUT IN THE STREETS.
>> Stephen: THEY ROSE UP.
>> THEY WANTED A CHANGE.
AND THIS GOVERNMENT BRUTALLY
CRACKED DOWN ON THEM.
AND SINCE THEN, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SLIGHTLY MORE MODERATE HAVE
BEEN REMOVED FROM THE
GOVERNMENT.
PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AS HARD
LINED AS SOME OF THOSE WHO
ARE IN THERE NOW.
AND ODDLY ENOUGH, SOME
PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT
POTENTIALLY AHMADINEJAD IS
ONE OF THE MODERATES RIGHT
NOW.
NOT MODERATE BUT IN
COMPARISON.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING,
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS
A CRAZIER GUY IN THE WINGS.
>> THAT IS WHAT THEY-- NOT A
CRAZIER GUY IN THE WINGS.
>> Stephen: KRASESIER GIRL.
>> THEY ARE-- I'M NOT SURE,
NO, NOT GIRL, NOT THERE.
YOU KNOW, THE REVOLUTIONARY
GUARD, ARE VERY HARD LINE.
AHMADINEJAD HIMSELF IS
POINTING TO HIMSELF AS A
LESS DANGEROUS, LESS WACKY.
YOU GUYS, BY YOUR ACTIONS
ARE THREATENING TO BRING A
WAR AGAINST US.
SO THIS-- .
>> Stephen: HE'S PLAYING
GOOD COP BAD COP WITH US.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: WITH NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY PUT MY
MIND AT EASE.
CRIST YAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
CHRISTIANE A AMMAN TOUR,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.
