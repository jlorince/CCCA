>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, IT'S NO SECRET.
I'VE SAID IT ON THIS SHOW MANY
TIMES.
I AM AN AVID WATCHER OF THE
"TODAY SHOW."
I WATCH IT JUST TO FIND OUT WHAT
DAY IT IS.
TURNS OUT IT'S TODAY.
THEY ALWAYS GET THAT RIGHT.
BUT EARLIER THIS WEEK, FOLKS, I
SAW A SEGMENT THAT SHOOK MY
FAITH IN BREAKFAST NEWS.
IVAN.
>> THIS MORNING WE'RE KICKING
OFF A SPECIAL SERIES, BREAST
OBSESSED IN AMERICA.
>> THERE ARE SO MANY WORDS FOR
THESE, TAH-TAHS, PUPPIES, RACK.
>> Stephen: THE RACK?
I AM DISAPPOINTED.
THIS IS THE KIND OF FILTH I
EXPECT FROM CHARLES OSGOOD.
THIS BREAST OBSESSED IN MESH
SERIES IS A BLATANT PABDZERING
DRESSED UP LIKE NEWS.
LOOK AT NBC'S EVIDENCE THAT
AMERICA IS BREAST CRAZY.
>> HOW MUCH ARE BREASTS ON THE
HUMAN MIND?
A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH FOR THEM
PAIRED WITH BOOBS AND A SLANG
WORD STARTING WITH THE TURNS UP
ALMOST A BILLION HITS, MORE THAN
FOUR TIMES THE YIELD FOR A
SEARCH ON THE BRAIN.
>> Stephen: ALMOST NOBODY IS
LOOKING UP BRAINS.
OR APPARENTLY USING THEM AT NBC.
THIS KIND OF "REPORTING" HAS NO
PLACE ON A NEWS SHOW.
IT IS DISGUSTING.
IT IS DEBASING.
IT IS VILE.
AND NBCIOUS I HAVE JUST ONE
THING TO SAY, WHAT ABOUT BUST?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I LIKE BIG BUSTS AND I CANNOT
LIE.
I'M A BUTT MAN.
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF US, LIKE
TWO-TIME PULITZER PRIZE WINNER
AUTHOR DAVID McCULLOUGH.
>> MY ANACONDA DON'T WANT NONE
UNLESS YOU GOT BUNS, HON.
>> Stephen: SEE?
SO TELL ME, NBC, WHERE'S BUTT
WEEK?
I WANT HARD-HITTING REPORTS ON
HIGH AND TIGHT APPLE BOTTOM
BOOTIES YOU CAN BOUNCE A QUARTER
OFF AND GET BACK TWO DIMES AND A
NICKEL.
IN-DEPTH EXPOSES ON THE SWEET
BEACHY CURVES YOU JUST WANT TO
POLISH WITH WINDEX UNTIL YOU SEE
YOUR FACE IN IT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING SO
FIRM YOU CAN SNAP A POOL CUE
ACROSS IT.
ARE YOU SAVING THAT SCOOP FOR
BRIAN WILLIAMS?
I'M SAD TO SAY THIS IS A PATTERN
WITH THE PEACOCK.
THEY HAVE A NETWORK-WIDE
ANTI-BUTT BIAS.
WATCH ANY OF THEIR NEWS
COVERAGE.
THEIR ANCHOR, WORLD LEADERS
ALWAYS SHOT WAIST UP AND FROM
THE FRONT.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE NBC'S
PRECIOUS BOOBS ARE.
AND MORE TO THE POINT, IT'S
WHERE THE BUTT ISN'T.
YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE ASS ON NBC
EXCEPT ON CELEBRITY APPRENTICE.
I MEAN...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT.
TO HE'S TALKING OUT OF IT.
[LAUGHTER]
SO I HEREBY CALL ON THE COLBERT
NATION TO GO DOWN TO THE "TODAY
SHOW"'S WINDOW IN ROCKEFELLER
PLAZA TOMORROW MORNING AND
DEMAND EQUAL TIME FOR THE BOOTY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I WANT TO SEE SIGNS LIKE, "NO
KEESTERS, NO PEACE" AND "NBC
EQUALS NO BUTT COVERAGE."
THE POINT IS, BECAUSE HERE'S THE
POINT, FOLKS, THIS BOOB WEEK IS
JUST A CHEAP RATINGS GROPE, LIKE
SHARK WEEK.
OH, OH, YOU KNOW WHAT SOMEBODY
SHOULD DO?
SHARK BOOB WEEK.
OR BOOB SHARK WEEK.
THAT I WOULD WATCH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
