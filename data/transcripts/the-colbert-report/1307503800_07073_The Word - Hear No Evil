(LAUGHTER)
NATION, IT'S CLEAR PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS NOT COMMITTED TO THE
WAR ON TERROR.
TERRORISTS ARE ALL AROUND US AND
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
SO FAR WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TO STOP
THE TIMES SQUARE BOMBER AND THE
UNDERWEAR BOMBER WHEN THEIR
PLOTS FAILED.
BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE TERRORISTS ACQUIRE
NON-IDIOT TECHNOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, LUCKILY, THERE'S A WAY WE
CAN IDENTIFY TERRORISTS BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE AND IT'S THE
SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEAR NO EVIL.
NATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M ON
RECORD THAT THE TO PROTECT US
FROM TERROR WE NEED TO USE
RACIAL PROFILING.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME RACIST
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE RACE.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I
BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I THINK WE
NEED TO USE RACIAL PROFILING.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL
HAS A WAY TO IDENTIFY TERRORISTS
WITHOUT PROFILING AS HE
EXPLAINED ON THE RADIO'S "SEAN
AND HANNITY."
>> I'M NOT FOR PROFILING PEOPLE
ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN
RRELIGION BUT IF SOMEONE ISO
ATTENDING SPEECHES FROM SOMEONE
PROMOTING THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW
OF OUR GOVERNMENT, THAT'S AN
OFFENSE WE SHOULD BE GOING
AFTER.
THEY SHOULD BE DEPORTED OR PUT
IN PRISON.
>> Stephen: AND THAT IS
PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH RAND
PAUL'S LIBERTARIAN
CONSTITUTIONAL IDEALS.
AFTER ALL THE BILL OF RIGHTS
GUARANTEES FREEDOM OF SPEECH,
NOT FREEDOM OF LISTEN.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IT IS POSSIBLE...
(LAUGHTER).
IT IS CLEARLY POSSIBLE TO BE
RADICALIZE BID HEARING JUST ONE
SPEECH BECAUSE RADICALS ARE LIKE
KATY PERRY, YOU HEAR HER NEW
SONG, YOU SWEAR YOU DON'T LIKE
IT THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW
YOU'RE SINGING "TEENAGE DREAM"
IN FRONT OF YOUR INTERNS AND YOU
JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF A
COURT-ORDERED APOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, YES, I AM SAYING THAT KATY
PERRY IS A TERRORIST.
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOMB
THAT IS, BUT I SURE FEEL DIRTY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND REVOLUTIONARY SPEECH CAN
TURN UP ANYWHERE, FOLKS.
AT A RADICAL CHURCH.
>> GODDAMN AMERICA!
>> Stephen: OTT THE OSCARS.
>> WE LIVE IN FICTITIOUS TIMES.
WE LIVE A TIME WHERE WE HAVE
FICTITIOUS ELECTION RESULTS THAT
ELECT A FICTITIOUS PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: EVEN KENTUCKY'S
KNOB CREEK MACHINE GUN SHOOT.
THE NAME EVOKES A SIMILAR TIME
WHEN GRANDMA WOULD ROCK ON THE
PORCH FIRING 500 ROUNDS A MINUTE
FROM HER BROWNING M-1917 MACHINE
GUN.
TO ONE FORGETS TO CALL HER ON
HER BIRTHDAY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, AT...
(APPLAUSE).
AT THE KNOB CREEK MACHINE GUN
SHOOT, YOU CAN SHOP FROM VENDORS
SELLING A WIDE VARIETY OF GUNS,
EVEN FLAME THROWER RENTALS.
YOU NEVER WANT TO BUY A FLAME
THROWERS, OF COURSE, IT'S JUST
GOING TO BE A NEWER MODEL NEXT
YEAR.
IT'S LIKE APPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS, AT THE KNOB CREEK MACHINE
GUN SHOOT, THERE'S VENDORS
SELLING MILITIA HANDBOOKS AND
NAZI PAR A YALE YA WITH PRICES
SO LOW EVERYDAY IS A WHITE SALE.
(LAUGHTER)
UNFORTUNATELY THIS HARMLESS
GATHERING OF WEAPONS ENTHUSIASTS
HAS BEEN MARRED BY SPEECHES
ADVOCATING THE OVERTHROW OF THE
GOVERNMENT.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL 2010, THE
NOT AT ALL ANTI-SEMITIC
CHRISTIAN PATRIOT METAL BAND
POKER FACE PLAYED KNOB CREEK AND
THE BAND'S LEAD SINGER, TOM TOE
PETTY DECLARED OBAMA IS
BASICALLY THE EXCLAMATION POINT
ON THE TAKEOVER OF THE UNITED
STATES.
TOO MANY OF US ARE WAKING UP AND
TOO MANY OF US ARE HEAVILY
ARMED.
THEY ARE GOING TO PUSH AND WE
ARE GOING TO SHOVE BACK.
THE SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION
WILL COMMENCEMENT SCARY STUFF.
AND BY RAND PAUL'S LOGIC, ANYONE
THERE TO HEAR THEM SHOULD BE
ARRESTED.
F.B.I., YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO
ARREST THIS GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
ARREST THIS GUY.
AND ARREST... WAIT A MINUTE,
JIMMY, FREEZE!
ENHANCE!
THAT'S RAND PAUL!
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
SENATOR RAND PAUL WHO, ON HIS
OWN WEB SITE, ADMITS HE WAS
THERE.
AND FACE IT, BEING A TERRORIST
MAKES MORE SENSE THAN HIS
PREVIOUS COVER STORY, THAT HE'S
AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST.
OH, MY GOD!
(LAUGHTER)
SO IF YOU SEE THIS DANGEROUS
FUGITIVE, PLEASE CALL THE
AUTHORITIES.
BUT FIRST, PUT IN SOME EARPLUGS
BECAUSE IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING HE
HAS TO SAY, RAND PAUL SAYS WE
HAVE TO ARREST YOU, TOO.
AND THAT'S THE
