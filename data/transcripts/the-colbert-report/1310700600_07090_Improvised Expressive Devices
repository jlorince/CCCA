>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY, VERY GENEROUS.
I CAN TELL.
FOLKS, HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA, WE'RE UNDER CONSTANT
THREAT FROM FORCES WORKING TO
UNDERMINE OUR VALUES.
FROM THE GAY AGENDA TO GREEK
YOGURT.
YEAH, I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE SOME
GREEK GUY'S WORD THAT IT'S FULL
OF GOOD BACTERIA.
DON'T TRUST THEM.
I ALWAYS STIR IN A SPOONFUL OF
PURELL FIRST.
AND, OF COURSE, TERRORISTS.
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAPTURE THEM
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SAFE FROM
THEM.
TAKE GITMO.
EVIDENTLY THE TERRORISTS WHO
THEY'VE BEEN HOLDING THERE HAVE
BEEN BUSY BEHIND THE BARS
CRAFTING A DANGEROUS NEW
WEAPON -- ART.
YOU SEE, EVIDENTLY DOZENS OF
SUBVERSIVE WORKS HAVE BEEN
CREATED BY GITMO DETAINEES FROM
THIS TERROR SUNSET TO THIS OSAMA
BIN LANDSCAPE.
FOLKS, THESE ARE DANGEROUS
I.E.D.s -- IMPROVISED
EXPRESSIVE DEVICES.
WE THOUGHT ENHANCED
INTERROGATION WOULD GIVE US
INFORMATION, BUT INSTEAD WE
TURNED GITMO INTO AN ARTIST
COLONY FULL OF LITERALLY
TORTURED ARTISTS.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS, THIS IS WHY WE CANNOT HAVE
THEM IN CIVILIAN COURTS.
THE COURTROOM SKETCH ARTISTS
WOULD BE ON THEIR SIDE AND MAKE
THEM LOOK GOOD.
IT WOULD TAINT THE JURY POOL,
AND THEN THESE GUYS WOULD GET
OFF, AND WHEN THEY'RE BACK ON
THE STREETS, THEY WON'T NEED
BOMBS TO BLOW UP OUR BUILDINGS
BECAUSE WITH THE STROKE OF A
BRUSH, THEY CAN SHATTER OUR
AESTHETIC PARADIGM.
CONSIDER THIS STILL LIFE BY ONE
OF THE INMATES, THE MELON, A
SEVERED COMPLETENESS, AN ISLAND
IDENTITY ISOLATED FROM THE
WHOLE, PROXIED FROM THE
PRISONER, REMOVED FROM SOCIETY,
FOREGROUND OF THE PRODUCTION
BECOMES AMPLIFICATION, HEDGE
MONIC HISTORICAL MYTH MAKING CUT
BY THE NON-SCAPE OF THE WHITE.
THIS IS CANVAS AS THEATER OF
EXISTENTIAL WARFARE, AN
INSURGENCY OF THE VOICELESS
SUBALTERN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I ASK YOU... I ASK YOU, WHO IS
THE PRISONER NOW?
[LAUGHTER]
OR THIS, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD
BOAT.
NATION... GOOD BOAT.
SURVEYING THEIR OOV, IT NOW
OCCURS TO ME, COULD ALL OF GITMO
BE ONE GIANT ART INSTALLATION?
TAKE OUR ENEMIES FROM THE
STONE-AGE VILLAGES IN
AFGHANISTAN, FLY THEM HALFWAY
ACROSS THE WORLD AND DROP THEM
INTO AN EXTRA GOVERNMENTAL
SPACE, NEITHER AMERICAN NOR THE
BATTLEFIELD.
HEREIN USING UNCHECKED EXECUTIVE
POWER IN AN ACT OF BLISTERING
SELF-CRITICAL TEXTURALIZATION,
NOT TO MENTION SOME OF THOSE
GUYS LOOK LIKE THEY GOT WRAPPED
UP BY CRISTO.
SO I SAY, FORGET MARINE
ABROMOVICH, FORGET LORI
ANDERSON, THE GREATEST
PERFORMANCE ARTISTS OF OUR
GENERATION ARE THESE TWO
