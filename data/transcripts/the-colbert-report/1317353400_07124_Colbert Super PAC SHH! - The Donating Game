>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST
JOINED US, I HELPED FORM COLBERT
SUPERPACK SHH, A 501 C4 THAT
ACCEPTS UNLIMITED BUT SECRET
DONATIONS.
THAT MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO
DISCLOSE MY DONORS ANYMORE, SO,
JIMMY, LET'S SWITCH TO THE NEW
501 C-4 CRAWL.
THERE YOU GO.
NOW, IT TURNS OUT THAT MY
FRIEND, KARL ROVE, HAS A PAC
THAT IS PRIMARILY FUNDED BY A
FEW HIGH ROLLERS.
IN FACT N2011, 90% OF HIS MONEY
CAME FROM JUST THREE BILLIONAIRE
DONORS.
FOLKS, BILLIONAIRES ARE JUST
SALT OF THE EARTH PEOPLE, IN
THAT THEY OWN SALT MINES AND
MUCH OF THE EARTH
( LAUGHTER )
AND, ALSO, SOME PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT C-4s ARE MUCH BETTER THAN
PACS.
ACCORDING TO THE SEC, THEY DON'T
HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEY'RE BILLION
ARIZONA.
THEY'RE LIKE CAMPAIGN FINANCE
GLORY HOLES.
YOU STICK YOUR MONEY IN THE
HOLE, THE OTHER PERSON ACCEPTS
YOUR DONATION, AND BECAUSE IT'S
HAPPENING ANONYMOUSLY, NO ONE
FEELS DIRTY
( LAUGHTER )
SO, CLEARLY, I NEEDS ME A SUGAR
DADDY.
