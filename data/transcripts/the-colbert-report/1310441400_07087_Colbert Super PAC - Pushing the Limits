(LAUGHTER)
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME, FOLKS.
LET'S GET TO THE BIG NEWS,
ME.
YOU SEE BEFORE THE BREAK THE
FEC GAVE ME PERMISSION TO
FORM COLBERT SUPERPAC AND
COLLECT UNLIMITED DONATIONS.
WHEN I MERGED FROM THAT
CROWD MY G-STRING WAS
STUFFED WITH DOLLAR BILLS.
AND I WASN'T EVEN WEARING A
G-STRING WHEN I STARTED.
SO THANKS TO WHOEVER DONATED
THAT.
AND THE MEDIA REACTION HAS
BEEN OVERWHELMING.
WITH HEADLINES LIKE COLBERT
SUPERPAC PUSHES THE LIMITS
OF ELECTION LAW.
COLE PERT SUPERPAC GOOD FOR
GOVERNMENT AND GOOD FOR US,
AND COLBERT IS A SUPERPAC LA
BOEUF OVER TRANSFORMERS.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NO SURPRISE.
NO SURPRISE, MY SUPERPAC AND
THE TRANSFORMER SERIES HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.
I CAN ALSO RAKE IN MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS FOR NO APPARENT
REASON.
SO --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, HOGGING
THE SPACE A LITTLE BIT
THERE.
SO FOLKS IF YOU HAVE NOT
DONE SO ALREADY GO OVER TO
COLBERT SUPERPAC.COM AND
SIGN UP.
SO FAR OVER 94,000 OF YOU
HAVE BECOME MEMBERS.
AND TRUST ME, AND ONE PERSON
CLAP -- AND TRUST ME, NO, NO,
IT'S TOO LATE.
AND TRUST ME, I WILL ONLY
USE YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESSES
FOR GOOD.
YOU'LL BE BURIED UNDER AV AN
AVALANCHE OF SPAM NOT SEEN
SINCE THE 1968 EXPLOSION OF
THE HORMEL FACTORY.
(APPLAUSE)
NOW THE SUPREME COURT'S
DECISION IN THE CITIZENS
UNITED CASE ALLOWS FOR
UNLIMITED DONATIONS.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE, ON THE
COLBERT SUPERPAC TOTE BOARD
WE HAVE SO FAR RAISED
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 100 AND
OUR GOAL OF INFINITE
DOLLARS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO SOMEWHERE IN
HERE.

WE'RE SO CLOSE TO INFINITE
DOLLARS.
(LAUGHTER)
