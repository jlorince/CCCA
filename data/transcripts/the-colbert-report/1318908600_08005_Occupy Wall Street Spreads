STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO
THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, YOU DO
THAT SO WELL I COULD LISTEN
TO IT FOR SIX YEARS.
I ALSO WANT TO INFORM ANY
PROFESSORS WHO MIGHT BE
WATCHING, TONIGHT COUNTS AS
ONE BIOCHEM CREDIT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A
GREAT COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND.
SEEMS LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE
LEFT WHO STILL TAKES OFF THE
TRADITIONAL NINE DAYS.
WE'VE HAD GLORIOUS AUTUMN
WEATHER HERE IN NEW YORK,
NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY.
A DOG URINE INDEX BELOW 4.
(LAUGHTER)
SO SATURDAY I TOOK THE WOL
FAMILY TO TIMES SQUARE TO
SEE PIE FAVORITE MUSICAL
COMEDY "PHANTOM"
HE'S DEFORMED.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I DID NOT NEED TO
BECAUSE WE GOT TO SEE SOME
FREE, SPEC FACT LAR STREET
THEATRE THAT-- SPECTACULAR
STREET THEATRE THAT SEEMED
TO BE A COMBINATION OF "RENT",
"LES MIS", "HAIR" AND "STOMP"
APPARENTLY THE OCCUPY WALL
STREET PROTESTS BROADCAST
OUT OF THEIR CARE-FREE
BIODEGRADABLE FREE LOVE
SWEAT LODGE DOWN IN ZURCOTTI
PARK AND SPREAD THEIR
ANTI-1% MESSAGE ALL OVER THE
WORLD FROM BOSTON TO
PORTLAND TO LONDON TO TOKYO
TO ROME.
OF COURSE IN ITALY THE 1%
REFERS TO THE PORTION OF THE
COUNTRY THAT SILVIO
BERLUSCONI HAS NOT HAD SEX
WITH YET.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT MOST TROUBLING OF ALL IS
THAT THE OCCUPATION HAS
SPREAD RIGHT HERE TO MY
STUDIO.
LOOK AT THIS MOB OF YOUNG--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SELFISHLESS
NE'ER-DO-WELLS.
NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR
LIVES.
WILLING TO STAND FOR HOURS
ON END, ENDURE HARSH
TREATMENT AND OVERCROWDING,
ALL FOR THE CHANCE TO YELL
AT SOME POOR GUY IN A SUIT.
WELL, I SAY BRING IT ON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, FAIR WARNING, FAIR
WARNING, DON'T TRY TO RUSH
THE DESK.
I AM ARMED WITH PEPPER SPRAY
