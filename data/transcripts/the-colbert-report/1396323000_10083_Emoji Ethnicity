(AUDIENCE CHANTING)>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: FOLKS, I KNOW THIS
IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VEHEARD ME SAY THIS -- FOLKS, I
KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIMEYOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS, BUT
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TOTHIS COUNTRY?
EVERYDAY, WE LOSE A LITTLE BITMORE.
THIS MORNING, I LOOKED AT THESOLE OF MY SHOE AND IT SAID:
"MADE IN VIETNAM."
(LAUGHTER)C'MON, THIS IS AMERICA.
IT SHOULD SAY "MADE IN CHINA"!!
(LAUGHTER)WELL, NOW, THE FORCES OF
CULTURAL CORROSION ARE TARGETINGTHE PRECIOUS LITTLE MIRACLES WE
HOLD MOST DEAR.
OUR PHONES.
(LAUGHTER)JIM?
>> YOU KNOW THE SMILEY FACEICONS CALLED EMOGI ALL OVER YOUR
TEXT AND TWEETS? APPLE IS SAYINGTHEY'RE NOT DIVERSE ENOUGH.
THEY'RE WORKING WITH UNICODECONSORTIUM TO COME UP WITH NEW
ONES!
>> Stephen: UGH!
THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRYFACE THATI COULD PUNCH A SNOWMAN INTO A
CIRCUS TENT FULL OF SEXYSTILETTOS.
AFTER THAT, I'LL HAVE TO COOLDOWN WITH A HANDFUL OF PILLS AND
A TURKEY DRUMSTICK.
(LAUGHTER)LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE DIVERSITY MAFIA IS WHININGTHAT THE EMOJI CHARACTERS ARE
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE.
OF COURSE THEY ARE!
WHITE MALE IS AMERICAN NEUTRAL.
IT'S THE BASELINE MODEL.
IF YOU WANT TO ACCESSORIZE,YOU'RE FREE TO ADD BELLS AND
WHISTLES LIKE "MELANIN" OR"VAGINA."
BUT NOW, THE PC POLICE ARE GONNASHOVE NEW ETHNIC EMOTIONS INTO
OUR PHONES.
I CAN'T JUST BE SAD ANYMORE.
I'LL HAVE TO BE "BLACK" SAD.
(LAUGHTER)I'M SORRY.
THAT'S WAY SADDER THAN I'MWILLING TO BE!
BESIDES, THERE'S ALREADY PLENTYOF DIVERSITY ON THE EMOJI
KEYBOARD.
LIKE TURBAN GUY. (LAUGHTER)HE COULD REPRESENT ANYTHING.
A HINDU, A MUSLIM, A GENIE, ORHEAD TRAUMA VICTIM OF ANY RACE.
