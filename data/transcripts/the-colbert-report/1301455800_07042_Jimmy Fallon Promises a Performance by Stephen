FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, I AM IN THE
FORTH WEEK OF MY SIX-MONTH BEST
FRIENDSHIP WITH JIMMY FALLON.
WE ARE SO CLOSE.
WHEN I'M NOT DOING THIS SHOW,
SPENDING TIME WITH MY FAMILY,
SLEEPING, BUILDING AN R.C. CAR,
LEARNING TO PLAY THE MANDOLIN,
FLOSSING OR DIGITIZING OLD
PHOTOS I AM THERE FOR HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH IS WHY AFTER MY PORTRAIT
WAS AUCTIONED OFF FOR CHARITY
LAST WEEK, I WAS SO TOUCHED TO
MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
JIM?
I AM HAPPY AND THRILLED TO
REPORT THAT MY BEST FRIEND FOR
SIX MONTHS JIMMY FALLON WILL BE
MATCHING THAT $26,000 TO
DONORSHOES.ORG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
VERY GENEROUS.
VERY GENEROUS.
BUT, FOLKS, WHEN YOU LET A BEST
FRIEND INTO YOUR HEART...
(LAUGHTER).
THEY CAN BREAK IT, TOO
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
LAST WEEK, I SAID HE WAS GIVING
$26,000 BUT LAST NIGHT JIMMY
SAID THIS.
>> HERE'S THE THING.
I NEVER SAID THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT I
DON'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE PUTTING
WORDS IN MY MOUTH.
>> Stephen: OH, STRAWBERRIES
IN YOUR MOUTH ARE OKAY BUT WORDS
BOTHER YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
I WAS SO UPSET THAT I WENT ON
HIS SHOW TO ATTACK HIM AS A
FRIEND!
IF YOU CAN'T DONATE $26,000, IF
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S MONEY WITHOUT
ASKING HIM FIRST...
(LAUGHTER).
WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING BEST
FRIENDS?
>> STEPHEN, HOLD ON...
>> Stephen: I CANNOT DO THIS
ANYMORE, JIMMY!
I GIVE AND I GIVE AND I GIVE
YOUR NOUN OTHER PEOPLE AND I GET
NOTHING BACK!
AND THEN I JUST GOT OUT OF
THERE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I GOT
HOME.
I'LL ASK MY DRIVER.
(LAUGHTER)
THEN LATER WHEN I WASHED MYSELF
ON JIMMY'S SHOW I WAS SHOCKED TO
SEE THIS.
>> I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO FIX
THIS IS TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH
THIS $26,000.
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP.
IF WE CAN RAISE $26,000 BY THIS
FRIDAY, I WILL PROMISE THAT MY
B.F.F. FOR SIX MONTHS, STEPHEN
COLBERT, WILL COME ON THIS SHOW
AND SING REBECCA BLACK'S
"FRIDAY" WITH THE GROUP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S A PROMISE I AM MAKING
FROM HIM TO YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT THE (BLEEP)?
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
ALL I DID WAS PLEDGE $26,000 OF
YOUR MONEY!
I NEVER SAID I'D SING.
AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
"FRIDAY" SONG?
JIMMY, GIVE ME A TASTE
♪ FRIDAY, FRIDAY, KICKING DAWN
ON FRIDAY
♪ EVERYBODY LOOKING FORWARD TO
THE WEEKEND
♪ PARTYING PARTYING, PARTYING
PARTYING
♪ FUN, FUN, FUN, FUN ♪
>> Stephen: FUN, FUN, FUNNING
FUN.
HOW MANY "FUNS" IS THAT?
THERE'S NO WAY TO LEARN THOSE
LYRICS BY THE LAST WEEKDAY,
WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, WE CAN NOT LET THIS
HAPPEN.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GO TO
JIMMY'S DONATION PAGE AT
DONORSCHOOSE.ORG/FALLONCOLBERT
PR
OJECT AND DONATE TO BENEFIT
CLASSROOMS IN NEED.
ESPECIAL DI DO NOT GO TO
COLBERTNATION.COM WHERE WE HAVE
A DONATION BUTTON THAT IS LARGE
AND EASY FOR YOU TO AVOID.
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS MAN BECAUSE
IF JIMMY FALLON REACHES HIS
GOAL, I WILL BE FORCED TO GIVE
THE PERFORMANCE OF A LIFETIME.
(LAUGHTER)
BESIDES, FRIDAY NIGHT IS THE
NIGHT WHEN JIMMY AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO GO SEE "HOP."
(LAUGHTER)
