I'M SURE THAT WILL FEEL BETTER NEXT TIME I HAVE TO SAY IT.
BUT NOW ROMNEY HAS TO DO SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT COME NATURALLY TO HIM-- APPEAL TO VOTERS.
SPECIFICALLY ONE KEY DEMOGRAPHICO.
JIM?
>> THE HISPANIC VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.
>> THIS BECOMES A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH HISPANIC VOTERS.
WE SAW A BIG FALLOFF IN THE HISPANIC VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS AND THOSE VOTERS ARE VERY
IMPORTANT, AS I MENTIONED, IN A LOT OF SWING STATES.
>> THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT VOTING BLOCK.
THERE IS A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE LATINO VOTE AT AROUND 33% THAT
YOU CANNOT WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER.
>> Stephen: YES.
REPUBLICANS WILL NEED TO WORK HARD TO CAPTURE THE LATINO VOTE INSTEAD OF THEIR CURRENT
STRATEGY OF CAPTURING LATINOS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT THAT I BELIEVE ROMNEY HAS A SHOT BECAUSE OF HIS HISPANIC ROOTS THAT RUN DEEP.
>> MY FATHER WAS BORN IN MEXICO.
>> Stephen: YES!
HIS FATHER LIVED IN MEXICO UNTIL HE SET OUT FOR A BETTER LIFE BY DRIVING OVER THE BORDER WITH
YOUNG MID-STRAPPED TO THE ROOF OF HIS CAR.
(LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, BACK IN 1885, MITT'S GREAT GRANDFATHER MILES PARK
ROMNEY EMIGRATED TO MEXICO TO ESCAPE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION OF MORMONS.
SADLY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SIMPLY WOULD NOT LEAVE MR. ROMNEY AND HIS WIFE AND HIS
WIFE AND HIS WIFE AND HIS WIFE AND HIS WIFE ALONE!
(LAUGHTER) IN FACT, ROMNEY HAD SUCH LATINO APPEAL THAT ACCORDING TO A FOX
NEWS POLL IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TOMORROW HE WOULD CLAIM A WHOPPING 14% OF THEM!
NOW, 14% SOUNDS BAD, BUT 16% ARE UNDECIDED.
AND IF ROMNEY WORKS HARD AND CAPTURES THEM HE...
(LAUGHTER) ... WOULD STILL LOSE VERY BADLY.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW WHY AREN'T HISPANIC AMERICANS RESPONDING TO THE MITT
ROMNEY PHENOMENON?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT MITT ROMNEY'S POSITIONS ON THINGS LIKE THE
DREAM ACT, IMMIGRATION REFORM,
EVEN SONIA SOTOMAYOR BEING ON THE COURT, HE'S TAKEN A HARD LINE.
>> HE HAS SAID THAT ALL 11 MILLION IMMIGRANTS, MOST OF THEM LATINOS, SHOULD SELF-DEPORT.
EVEN IF THEY'VE LIVED HERE SINCE THEY WERE CHILDREN.
>> HE'S CALLING ARIZONA'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION LAWS A MODEL
FOR THE COUNTRY AND CAMPAIGNING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THAT BILL.
HE'S PROBABLY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF EVERY ISSUE IMPORTANT TO LATINOS.
>> Stephen: MITT HAD TO TAKE ALL THOSE ANTI-IMMIGRANT POSITIONS
TO APPEAL TO THE G.O.P.'S CONSERVATIVE BASE IN THE PRIMARY AND THAT LEAVES HIM AND THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN SOMETHING OF A BIND.
HOW DO THEY NOW APPEAL TO THE HISPANIC VOTERS WITHOUT COMING OFF AS A BUNCH OF
IMMIGRANT-CODDLING AMNESTY HUGGERS?
WELL, ONCE AGAIN, COLBERT SUPER PAC COMES TO THE RESCUE.
WITH A BOLD SERIES OF ONE AD THAT EXPLAINS THE REPUBLICAN POSITION ON LATINO ISSUES IN A
LANGUAGE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND ENGLISH WITH A SPANISH ACCENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> (IN SPANISH ACCENT) PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED HE'D FIX THE ECONOMY.
INSTEAD WE HAVE RECORD DEFICIT AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT.
WHERE ARE THE AMERICAN JOBS I CAME TO STEAL?
>> DO WE EVEN HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR ME TO ABUSE?
>> IF THINGS GET REALLY BAD,
THERE WILL BE COMPETITION FOR THE CRIMES I WANT TO COMMIT?
>> I AM DIABLO!
I WILL CRUSH YOU!
TEQUILA!
>> HISPANIC VOTERS, DON'T LET WASHINGTON PUSH YOU AROUND.
VOTE REPUBLICAN IN 2012.
THEN KINDLY SEE YOURSELVES OUT.
: (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I THINK WE'RE A LOCK FOR NEXT
YEAR'S LATIN GRAMMY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
