(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME BACK.
EVERYBODY KNOWS AND IT'S NO
SECRET OUT THERE THAT I HAVE HAD
A LONG TIME BEEF WITH "SESAME
STREET".
THEY TEACH OUR KIDS ALL THE
WRONG LESSONS.
LIKE THE HAIRY MAN LIVING IN A
DUMPSTER IS YOUR FRIEND.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THAT THE LETTER "D" IS A
RELIABLE SPONSOR.
PAY UP, "D."
DON'T MAKE ME SEND 7 AFTER YOU.
YOU HEARD WHAT 7 DID TO 9.
BUT NOW THESE MONSTERS-- COOKIE
AND OTHERWISE-- ARE BRAINWASHING
OUR KIDS AS PART OF A NEW
INITIATIVE CALLED "FOR ME, FOR
YOU, FOR LATER."
WHICH TEACHES TOT IT IS
IMPORTANCE OF SAVING AND
SELF-CONTROL.
THE D.V.D. IS A LITTLE CONFUSING
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER FROM
MY REPEATED VIEWINGS--
(LAUGHTER)
-- ELMO WANT SHINY BALL.
>> A STUPENDOUS BALL.
♪ STUPENDOUS BALL ♪
>> SINCE COMMERCE ON "SESAME
STREET" RUNS ON A PURELY CASH
BASIS, IF YOU WANT A STUPENDOUS
BALL, $5 APIECE, AND YOU'VE ONLY
GOT, SAY, ONE DOLLAR, YOU CAN'T
BORROW, YOU HAVE TO SAVE UP FOR
IT.
>> Stephen: RIDICULOUS!
WHY SHOULD ELMO SAVE UP FOR IT
WHEN ELMO PRO-APPROVED FOR BRAND
NEW STUPENDOUS BALL CARD?
(LAUGHTER)
ELMO CALL STEPHEN NOW, LIMITED
TIME OFFER!
BESIDES, "SESAME STREET" HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT INDULGING YOUR
IMPULSES.
WHETHER IT BE GOING ON A
BLACKOUT COOKIE BENDER OR
CACKLING ABOUT YOUR
UNCONTROLLABLE O.C.D.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, THAT COULD BE MANAGED
WITH ONE, TWO, THREE DOSES OF
PAXIL!
HA HA HA HA HA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BEAUTIFUL PAXIL!
THIS MUPPET FISCAL CONSERVE
STICHL BASED ON A SOCIAL SCIENCE
EXPERIMENT CALLED THE
MARSHMALLOW TEST.
FOR MORE, WE TURN TO GROVER AND
AN UNNAMED MUPPET NAMED LEATHER.
>> SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO THIS
STUFF WITH KIDS YOUR AGE, THEY
SAY "I'LL GIVE YOU A MARSHMALLOW
NOW OR IF YOU WAIT AA LITTLE
WHILE I'LL GIVE YOU TWO
MARSHMALLOWS, BUT ONLY IF YOU
WAIT."
>> THE MARSHMALLOWS!
>> WOULD IT BE HARD TO WAIT?
>> IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO WAIT
YES.
>> Stephen: VERY HARD TO WAIT
FOR MARSHMALLOWS.
I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT GROVER
MEAT.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD.
NOW, THIS EXPERIMENT WAS FIRST
PERFORMED IN 12970s TO DETERMINE
A CHILD'S SELF-CONTROL AND THE
RESULTS WERE STARTLING.
ACCORDING TO THE STUDY KIDS KIDS
WHO AT THE AGE OF THREE
DISPLAYED THE MOST SELF-CONTROL
WERE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE
HEALTHY AND WEALTHY IN THEIR
30s.
EVIDENTLY, YOUR ABILITY TO
RESIST EATING A MARSHMALLOW
DETERMINES YOUR FUTURE SUCCESS.
(LAUGHTER)
I SAY IT'S TIME TO TEST THIS
THEORY.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A BAG OF
MARSHMALLOWS RIGHT HERE AND...
(LAUGHTER)
... I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT WAS
FULL BEFORE THE SHOW.
NEVER MIND, I ALWAYS CARRY A
SPARE BAG.
SO THE THEORY IS THAT IF I
RESIST EATING THIS NOW THEN I
GET TO HAVE TWO LATER.
LET'S TRY IT.
WHERE'S THE MARSHMALLOWS?
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S TRY IT THE OTHER WAY.
LEER TWO THAT I CAN HAVE LATER.
I WAS WRONG AS I RESISTED EATING
THIS ONE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WHERE THE (BLEEP) ARE MY
MARSHMALLOWS?
(LAUGHTER)
JIMMY!
JIMMY, WE NEED TO SPRAY THE
STUDIO FOR RACCOONS AGAIN.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL TRY IT WITH A DIFFERENT
FOOD.
OKAY, HERE'S BROCCOLI, OKAY?
NOW, IF I RESIST THIS STALK OF
BROCCOLI FOR TEN SECONDS, I CAN
HAVE TWO MARSHMALLOWS, ALL
RIGHT?
READY?
GO!
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENS!
I BET I CAN DO IT!
(AUDIENCE COUNTING DOWN)
I DID IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND NOW, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN GOOD
(LAUGHTER)
I CAN HAVE MY BROCCOLI.
MMM.
(LAUGHTER)
MMM.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
IN YOUR FACE, ELMO!
I'M EATING MARSHMALLOWS!
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
