>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WH OO, WHOO!
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, SORRY ABOUT THE GLASSES.
SORRY ABOUT THESE.
I'M JUST... OH, MY GOD, MY EYES
ARE STILL ADJUSTING.
I HAVE NOT SEEN DAYLIGHT SINCE
FRIDAY BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND
MARKED THE BEGINNING OF LEGAL
GAY MARRIAGE IN NEW YORK.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NO ESCAPE THE FORCE-FIVE
GAY-NADO ENGULFING THE CITY, I
RETREATED TO MY UNDERGROUND
HETERO-BUNKER.
NOW, I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT FOR
Y2K, BUT I HAVE RECENTLY ADAPTED
IT TO Y-TOO-GAY.
NOW, IT IS STOCKED WITH THINGS
THAT STRAIGHT MEN LOVE -- A
TEN-YEAR SUPPLY OF MANWICH, ALL
EIGHT SEASONS OF ""MAGNUM P.I.""
AND A DODGE PICKUP -- RAM TOUGH!
TURNS OUT IF YOU'RE ENCLOSED IN
A POORLY VENTILATED SPACE, YOU
SHOULD NOT LEAVE YOUR TRUCK
IDLING OR EAT NOTHING BUT
MANWICH FOR THREE DAYS.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH FUMES GOT ME
FIRST, BUT EVIDENTLY I PASSED
OUT BECAUSE NEXT THING I KNOW
I'M ABOVE GROUND IN THE ARMS OF
A HANDSOME FIREMAN.
NEW YORK'S BRAVEST.
SO I BOUGHT THE 20 THE 11
FIREMAN'S CALENDAR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I BOUGHT IT AS THANK YOU AND FOR
NO OTHER REASON.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS GOING TO LOOK GREAT ON
THE WALL OF MY HETERO BUNKER.
OH, MY LORD.
I CERTAINLY HOPE MY STUDIO
CATCHES FIRE IN OCTOBER.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT WAS A GOOD THING I STAYED
IN MY BUNKER ALL WEEKEND,
FOLKSIOUS BECAUSE JUST LOOK AT
THE DEVIANT FREAK SHOW THAT WAS
FIRST COUPLE TO BE MARRIED IN
NEW YORK CITY.
>> BY THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME
BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
MARRIED.
YOU MAY SEAL YOUR VOWS WITH A
KISS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, A
KISS ON THE CHEEK.
OR AS THEY CALL IT,
"SCISSORING."
LOOK AT THEM.
77-YEAR-OLD PHYLLIS SEGAL AND
HER 85-YEAR-OLD HUS-BRIDE CONNIE
KOPELOV.
COME ON, GIRLS!
DON'T MAKE THIS PERMANENT.
IT'S CLEARLY JUST A PHASE.
LOOK, I GET IT, YOU'RE AT AN
EXPERIMENTAL AGE, BUT TRUST ME,
THIS WILL WEAR OFFER THE SECOND
YOU GRADUATE FROM AQUA-JOGGING
CLASS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TWO ARE
GOING TO BREAK THIS TO YOUR
PARENTS.
IT'S GOING TO KILL THEM.
