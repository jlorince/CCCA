>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
NATION, NATION, FOLKS, YOUKNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS, I'VE
SAID THIS BEFORE, I HAVEALWAYS BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF
WASHINGTON THINK TANKS.
TOO MUCH THINK, NOT ENOUGHTANK.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THIS WEEK I LEARNED THAT
THERE IS SOMETHING EVENWORSE THAN BEING A
CHIN-STROKING INTELLICTU-NERD --AND THAT'S BEING A TRADER.
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES"NEWSPAPER  IS NOW REPORTS THAT
MORE THAN A DOZEN PROMINENTWASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUPS,
THINK TANKS, TOOK TENS OFMILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT MONEY INRECENT YEARS.
SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES WEREESSENTIALLY TRYING TO BUY
INFLUENCE, PAYING THOSETHINK TANKS TO PUT THEIR
POSITION IN A POSITIVELIGHT.
OR TO GAIN INFLUENCE WITHLAWMAKERS.
>> Stephen: YES, FOREIGNGOVERNMENTERS ARE BUYING
INFLUENCE. SO GOOD NEWS,AMERICA HAS AN EXPORT.
AND FOLKS, THE CORRUPTION BYSUPPOSEDLY INDEPENDENT THINK
TANKS LIKE THE BROOKINGSINSTITUTION GOES DEEP.
FOR INSTANCE, AFTER QATAR AGREEDTO MAKE A $14.8 BILLION DONATION
TO BROOKINGS, A VISITING FELLOWSAID HE HAS BEEN TOLD DURING
HIS JOB INTERVIEW THAT HECOULD NOT TAKE POSITIONS
CRITICAL OF THE QATARIGOVERNMENT.
AND HIS ONLY ACCEPTEDPRONUNCIATIONS OF THE
COUNTRY.
LIKE CUTTER, GUTTER, CUH-TAROR QUISNOS.
AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,JAPAN GAVE THE CENTER FOR
STATEGIC INTERNATIONAL STUDIESGAVE AT LEAST 1.1 MILLION FOR,
QUOTE, RESEARCH AND CONSULTINGFOR TRADE AND DIRECT INVESTMENT
BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE UNITEDSTATES.
WHEN ASKED WHY, A JAPANESEEMBASSY SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED
JAPAN IS NOT NECESSARILY THEMOST INTERESTING SUBJECT
AROUND THE WORLD.
NOTHING INTERESTING ABOUTJAPAN.
TAKE AWAY THE WHALING, THESEX ROBOTS AND STRAPPING
MEATS TO THE HEADS OFTEENAGE GIRLS--
OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S BASICALLYOHIO.
BUT THE NUMBER ONE FOREIGNINFLUENCE BUYER IS, SAY IT
WITH ME, NORWAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU-- THE DAMNNOROUIES COMMITTED AT LEAST
$24 MILLION TO AN ARRAY OFWASHINGTON THINK TANKS OVER
THE PAST FOUR YEARS TO RAISENORWAY'S PROFILE.
INCLUDING DONATIONS TO THECENTER FOR GLOBAL
DEVELOPMENT, THE ATLANTICCOUNCIL AND THE BROOKINGS
INSTITUTION.
WHICH EXPLAINS THIS FOOTAGEFROM BROOKINGS RECENT
SYMPOSIUM ON ERADICATING GLOBALHUNGER.
I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLDTHAT THAT CHEF IS ACTUALLY
SWEDISH.
WHICH IS APPARENTLY NOT THESAME THING AS NORWEGIAN?
OKAY, MY MISTAKE.
NORWAY SHOULD REALLY DOSOMETHING TO RAISE ITS
PROFILE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
