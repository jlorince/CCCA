ITCHERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLEASE WELCOME ZEV CHAFETS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ZEV, WELCOME BACK MY FRIEND.
>> NICE TO BE HERE.
>> STEPHEN: WE'VE GOT CHAFETS
IN THE HOUSE!
YOUR BOOK IS CALLED "COOPERSTOWN
CONTROVERSIAL.
HEROS ROGUES AND THE BASEBALL
HALL OF FAME.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE
BASEBALL HALL OF FAME.
THEY ARE INDUCTED THREE GUYS
THIS WEEKEND.
>> THIS SUNDAY.
>>.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT INJURE BEEF?
>> I DON'T HAVE A BEEF WITH THE
HALL OF FAME BUT I DO HAVE SORT
OF A PROBLEM WITH THE NOTION
THAT ITS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION
WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENSHRINED AND
IMMORTALIZED AND PEOPLE GO ON
PILGRIMAGES WITH THEY ARE SONS
AND SO ON.
THE HALL OF FAME HAS A LOT OF
GREAT BASEBALL PLAYERS IN IT.
A LOT OF THESE GUYS DESPITE WHAT
THE HALL SAYS ARE NOT THE
WORLD'S GREATEST HUMAN BEINGS.
>> STEPHEN: THEY SHOULDN'T BE.
THEY WERE WINNERS.
NICE GUYS FINISH LAST.
I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THE HALL ISN'T WITH US ON THAT
ONE.
THE HALL HAS A RULE CALLED RULE
FIVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY BECAUSE THERE'S
NO RULE ONE THROUGH FOUR.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
>> HONESTLY.
>> STEPHEN: I LIKE THAT.
>> THAT'S A DISCOVERY, RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: THEY ARE NOT COW T
OWING TO THE --
>> THE RULE STARTS AT FIVE.
YOU HAVE TO BE A EXEMPLAR OF
GOOD CHARACTER AND GOOD
INTEGRITY.
THAT DOESN'T DESCRIBE MANY OF
THE GUYS IN THE HALL OF FAME.
>> STEPHEN: OH, NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
TY COBB IN 1926 PISTOL WHIPPED A
CHINAMAN AT SECOND BASE.
THAT'S FAMOUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE
HAPPENED IN THE PAST THAT THESE
GREATS DID THAT WE'RE NOT HELD
TO THE SAME STANDARD?
>> YOU KNOW, BALL PLAYERS HAVE
ALWAYS USED STEROIDS AND
SUBSTANCES THEY COULD USE.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT SUBSTANCES.
THERE WEREN'T SUBSTANCES BACK
THEN.
>> OH, YES.
IN 1889 A PITCHER IN THE HALL OF
FAME NOW INJECTED MONKEY
TESTOSTERONE TO IMPROVE HIS
GAME.
>> STEPHEN: HE INGESTED MONKEY
TESTOSTERONE.
WILLINGLY OR WAS THIS THE
MONKEY'S IDEA?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THERE'S A LOT OF ORGAN GRINDERS
BACK THEN.
THE MONKEYS WOULD GET ON THE
LAMB.
THEY WOULD GET LOOSE.
WHAT DID HE HOPE TO DO WITH
MONKEY TESTOSTERONE AND WHERE
CAN I GET SOME?
>> HE HOPED TO IMPROVE HIS
PITCHING WHICH HE DID BECAUSE HE
WON THE GAME HE PITCHED AFTER
TAKING THE MONKEY TESTOSTERONE.
>> STEPHEN: WAS THIS COMMON?
>> YOU KNOW, HE IS REMEMBERED
FOR IT.
>> STEPHEN: OH, YES.
HE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR LITTLE
ELSE NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU SAY THAT SOME OF THESE GUYS
TOOK AMPHETAMINES.
>> THEY DID.
>> STEPHEN: THEY DRANK.
BABE RUTH DRANK PUBLICLY DURING
PROHIPITION.
>> IT WAS A FEDERALLY BANNED
SUBSTANCE.
>> STEPHEN: MICKEY MANTLE HIT
HOME RUNS --
>> MICKEY MANTLE WAS SHOT UP BY
A DOCTOR OF AMPHETAMINES AND
STEROIDS AND HAD TO SIT OUT THE
HOME RUN DERBY IN 1961 BECAUSE
HE HAD AN ABSCESS.
HE WAS THE SAME DOCTOR WAS THE
SAME DOCTOR THAT TREATED JOHN
KENNEDY.
HE USED TO INJECT JOHN F.
KENNEDY IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> STEPHEN: ARE YOU SAYING
MICKEY MANTLE WAS ON THE GRASSY
NOEL?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: WE COULD HAVE SOLD
SOME BOOKS.
>> WE CAME CLOSE.
>> STEPHEN: CLOSE TO A BEST
SELLER.
[ APPLAUSE ]
YOU SAY THAT THE PROBLEM ISN'T
THAT THESE GUYS BEHAVED THIS
WAY.
THE PROBLEM THESE DAYS IS THAT
THERE'S A COVERUP OF THE
BEHAVIOR.
>> SURE.
LIKE ALL THE CRIMES THE COVERUP
IS WORSE.
STEROIDS IS NOT A CRIME BECAUSE
TODAY EVERYBODY IS USING SOME
KIND OF PERFORMING ENHANCING
DRUGS.
>> STEPHEN: I'M ON THE JUICE
RIGHT NOW.
HERE SOON IDEA.
ON THE BACK OF THE PLAYERS CARD
IT NOT ONLY HAS THEIR STATS IT
HAS WHAT THEY ARE ON.
YOU CAN ROOT FOR THE TEAM AND
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY AT
THE SAME TIME.
ZEV, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
