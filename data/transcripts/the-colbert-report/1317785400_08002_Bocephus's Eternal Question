>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IF I SEEM A
LITTLE OFF TONIGHT.
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF SOME
CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS COUNTRY
STAR HANK WILLIAMS, JR.,
BOCEPHUS TO HIS SUPERFANS MADE
YESTERDAY ON FOX AND FRIENDS.
>> YOU REMEMBER THE GOLF GAME?
>> BOEHNER...
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
POLITICAL MISTAKES EVER.
>> YOU MEAN WHEN JOHN BOEHNER
PLAYED GOLF WITH PRESIDENT
OBAMA?
>> OH, YEAH!
YEAH!
AND BIDEN AND KASICH, YEAH.
UH-HUH.
THAT WOULD BE LIKE HITLER
PLAYING GOLF WITH NETANYAHU.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: WOW.
EVEN THE FOX AND FRIENDS WERE
TAKEN ABACK.
THEY'RE NOT USED TO HEARING THAT
SORT OF THING FROM PEOPLE WHO
DON'T WORK FOR THE NETWORK.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, THAT WAS NOT THE END
OF IT.
>> THEY'RE THE ENEMY.
>> WHO'S THE ENEMY?
>> OBAMA!
AND BIDEN!
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE THREE STOOGES.
>> WELL, THAT'S ONLY TWO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I RAN THAT PAST MY
OWN RESEARCHERS AND DOOCY IS
CORRECT, OBAMA AND BIDEN ADD UP
TO TWO, NOT THREE.
SO LAY OFF PEOPLE WHO SAY FOX
NEWS DOESN'T DO ANY FACT
CHECKING.
BUT CHILL OUT, STEVE DOOCY, NOT
EVERYTHING BOCEPHUS SAYS IS
MEANT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY.
HE IS AN ARTIST.
HE WORKS IN METAPHOR.
LIKE HIS SONG "BIG TOP WOMEN."
"THE BIG TOP WOMEN SURE DO
BOUNCE AROUND, I LOVE TO SEE
THEM WALKING UP AND DOWN."
BE BABOOM, BE BABOOM, MAKE YOU
GO DOWNTOWN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
CLEARLY A METAPHOR.
BIG TOP WOMEN ISN'T LITERALLY
ABOUT THE CIRCUS.
(LAUGHTER)
TRAGICALLY ESPN CAVED TO THE "WE
SHOULDN'T COMPARE THE PRESIDENT
TO HITLERSCHTAPO" SO LAST
NIGHT'S "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL"
DIDN'T BEGIN WITH HANK WILLIAMS,
JR., ASKING THE ETERNAL ETERNAL
QUESTION "ARE YOU READY FOR SOME
FOOTBALL?"
AND, NATION, NOT HEARING THAT
SONG LEFT ME DANGEROUSLY
UNPREPARED FOR SOME FOOTBALL!
(LAUGHTER)
I'M IN MY LIVING ROOM INNOCENTLY
WATCHING A CHEVY SILVERADO AD.
A BUNCH OF MEN IN SHINY TIGHTS
START HITTING EACH OTHER HURLING
AND KICKING A WEIRD LEVEL OBLATE
SPHERE ROHDE.
IT WAS HOURS BEFORE I REALIZED
IT WAS SOME FOOTBALL.
(LAUGHTER)
AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS NOT
READY FOR IT.
I'M SORRY, ESPN, YOU CAN
DISAGREE WITH A MAN'S POLITICS
BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ROB THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE OF THE PROPER
PROCEDURES OF FOOTBALL
PREPARATION.
BOCEPHUS ISN'T JUST ASKING IF
WE'RE READY RESTOREALLY, HE'S
ASKING US ALL TO EMBARK ON A
JOURNEY OF REFLECTION.
CHECK OUR SURROUNDINGS.
IS THERE ANY SUGGESTING
UNPREPAREDNESS FOR SOME
FOOTBALL?
PERHAPS AN EMPTY SNACK BOWL,
NEAR IS UNCHILLED, A TELEPHONE
SHAPED LIKE A BASEBALL.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT ABOUT OUTSTANDINGS ARE VICE
PRESIDENTs FROM MY ROWDY FRIEND?
MIGHT ALL OF THEM NOT COME OVER
TONIGHT?
LAST NIGHT WE WERE ROBBED OF
THAT AS A NATION AND WHY?
PERHAPS THE HITLER/NETANYAHU
GOLF GAME WOULDN'T BE SO BAD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ON THE WII IT IS CERTAINLY
ADORABLE.
IF YOU NOTICE, HITLER'S GOT A
BIT OF SLICE.
THAT'S WHY HE ALWAYS WENT INTO
BELGIUM.
BUT, FOLKS,... TRUE, TRUE STORY.
BUT FOLKS, SOMEONE HAS GOT TO
STEP UP AND MAKE SURE AMERICA IS
NEVER AGAIN CAUGHT UNAWARES BY
SOME FOOTBALL.
I TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO COMPOSE
THE NEXT "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL"
THEME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(SINGING OFF KEY)
(LAUGHTER)
♪ FOOTBALL... FOOTBALL, FOOTBALL
FOOTBALL ♪
(TO THE TUNE OF "JAWS")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
