>> Stephen: TONIGHT, HI.
HOW YOU BEEN?
(LAUGHTER)
BEFORE WE START THE
BROADCAST TONIGHT, I JUST
WANT TO ADDRESS MY RECENT
ABSENCE FROM THE NATIONAL
CONVERSATION.
AS THE HUB AROUND WHICH THE
REPUBLIC TURNS, I CAN
UNDERSTAND WHY THE MACHINERY
OF THIS GREAT NATION GROUND
TO A HALT LAST WEEK WHEN YOU
WERE DENIED THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I'M SURE YOU FELT THE
SAME WAY I DO WHEN I'M IN A
ROOM WITH NO MIRRORS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS, THERE WERE SOME
WILD RUMORS ABOUT WHY I WAS
GONE.
THESE ARE ACTUAL RUMORS FROM
THE ACTUAL INTERNET.
SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT MY
SHOW WAS CANCELLED BY THE
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS
COMMISSION AT THE REQUEST OF
THE FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION BECAUSE I WAS
ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE MY
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
OTHERS SAID I WAS CANCELLED
BECAUSE I OFFENDED THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH WHEN I
COMPARED THE POPE'S HAT TO A
GIANT YET STYLISH
PROPHYLACTIC.
(LAUGHTER)
STILL, OTHERS SAID, OTHERS
SAID I WAS IN REHAB, ALWAYS
AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION, IF
THEY HAVE THAT FOR DIET
COKE.
AND ONE PERSON, OR WHATEVER
PART OF THAT ORIGINAL PERSON
HAS NOT BEEN DERMABRAISED
OFF OF JOAN RIVERS SKULL,
ACCUSED ME OF TAKING TIME
OFF TO HAVE PLASTIC SURGERY.
>> I GUESS YOU WATCH STEPHEN
COLBERT BECAUSE HE'S COMING
BACK.
>> OH YES.
>> FINALLY, TONIGHT.
>> HE LEFT FOR MYSTERIOUS
REASON, AT LEAST LAST WEEK
THE REPORT CAME OUT THEY ARE
SUSPENDING THE SHOW
INDEFINITELY AND WE'RE NOT
SAYING WHY.
>> HE HAD A NOSE JOB.
>> DEVELOPED COVER STORES -- --
STORIES WHAT ARE SOME THEM.
>> I'M RESTED.
THAT IS WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY,
I FELL ASLEEP ON THE
OPERATING TABLE.
>> YOU WATCH STEPHEN IS
GOING TO HAVE NEW EYES.
>> WRONG, JOAN.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
I DID NOT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I DID NOT HAVE MY EYES DONE
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
I HAD MY ASS DONE.
THE DOCTORS CRANKED THIS
THING SO HIGH AND TIGHT YOU
CAN BARELY BLINK NOW.
ANYWAY, RUMORS QUELLED.
MOVING ON.
OH, ONE MORE THING.
EVIDENTLY HAVING 11 CHILDREN
MAKES YOU TOUGH AS NAILS.
CONFIDENTIAL TO A LOVELY
LADY.
BUT NOW, FOLKS.
CHORS
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THERE ARE STILL AS WE ALL
KNOW THERE ARE STILL ENEMIES
OF AMERICA OUT THERE WHO
HAVE HAD A FREE RIDE FOR TOO
LONG.
THAT ENDS TONIGHT.
JUST LIKE EVERY NIGHT.
ARE YOU READY TO GO GET
THESE BASTARDS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THEN WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR.
THIS IS THE
