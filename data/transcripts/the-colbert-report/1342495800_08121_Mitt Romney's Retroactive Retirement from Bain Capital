GIRLFRIEND BY THE PET NAME WORST NATURAL DISASTER OF THE MODERN ERA.
AND OF COURSE, FOLKS, NO ONE,
NO ONE TOOK MORE ADVANTAGE OF MY ABSENCE FROM THE SCENE THAN THE YOU COULD AD-- COWARD IN CHIEF.
YOU SEE THIS MAN IS RUNNING SCARED, FOLKS, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW MITT ROMNEY IS THE
MAN WE NEED IN THE WHITE HOUSE THANKS TO HIS YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE AT BAIN CAPITAL.
SO OBAMA IS NOW ATTACKING ROMNEY'S RECORD.
IT'S LIKE HE IS HELL-BENT ON MAKING WORD BAIN SYNONYMOUS WITH A SOURCE OF HARM OR RUIN.
(APPLAUSE) I'M MAD, I'M MAD.
I AM MAD.
OBAMA IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS OBAMA HAS SPENT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN KEY
BATTLEGROUND STATES RUNNING ANTI-ROMNEY ADS LIKE THIS.
>> OH BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAY.
FOR PURPLE MOUNTAIN MAJESTY,
ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAINS.
♪ AMERICA ♪ ♪ AMERICA ♪ ♪ GOD SHED HIS GRACE ON THEE ♪
♪ AND CROWN THY GOOD ♪ ♪ RZ NOW FOR THE RECORD MITT WAS ORIGINALLY ON KEY.
BUT HE OUTSOURCED MANY OF THOSE NOTES TO INDIA.
(APPLAUSE) FOLKS, OBAMA IS HAMMERING MITT OVER A "WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE THAT CLAIMS
THE FOLKS AT BAIN WERE PIONEERS IN THE PRACTICE OF SHIPPING WORK FROM THE UNITED STATES.
WHO CARES.
PIONEERS OPENED UP THE WEST.
BAIN WAS JUST LIKE THE DONOR PARTY.
THEY ATE THE WEAK.
(LAUGHTER) BESIDES, ROMNEY WASN'T EVEN AT BAIN DURING THE OUTSOURCING.
>> HI NO ROLE WHATSOEVER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BAIN CAPITAL AFTER FEBRUARY OF 1999.
NOT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM TO HAVE SAID THAT I WAS WITH THE FIRM BEYOND THAT.
>> Stephen: SEE, HE WASN'T MEAN THERE WHEN HE DID THOSE BAD THINGS THAT HE WAS IN NO
WAY ASSOCIATED WITH BUT IT'S FINE IF HE WAS.
HE LEFT BAIN IN 1999 TO GO TO THE SALT LAKE CITY OLYMPICS, WHICH HE WON, IN THE LOUNGE.
WELL, TECHNICALLY AS THE LOUGE.
HE'S A BIT STIFF BUT IT PAYS OFF.
PLAUS PLAUTS YOU ABOUT OBAMA IS CLAIMING ROMNEY RAN BAIN TILL 2002 ON THE TECHNICALITY THAT ROMNEY
SIGNED SEC FILINGS LISTING HIMSELF AS THE COMPANY'S SOLE STOCKHOLDER, CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WHO KNOWS.
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S TRUE?
IT'S A SIMPLE CASE OF HE SAID, HE FILED SEC DOCUMENTS TO CONTRADICT WHAT HE SAID.
AND OF COURSE, OF COURSE,
FOLKS, NO SURPRISE TEAM OBAMA IS PILING ON.
THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER STEPHANIE CUTTER SAYS THESE DOCUMENTS PROVE EITHER ROMNEY IS MISREPRESENTING
HIS POSITION AT BAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR HE IS MISREPRESENTING HIS POSITION
AT BAIN TO THE SEC, WHICH IS A FELONY.
NOT TRUE.
LYING TO THE SEC IS NOT A FELONY, IT'S AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS-- GET IT RIGHT.
GET IT RIGHT.
FOLKS, THERE'S A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR WHY ROMNEY HAS SAID ONE THING TO THE
PUBLIC AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE SEC.
AS ROMNEY SPOKESPERSON ED GILLESPIE EXPLAINED TO PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL CNN.
>> JIM.
>> HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND IN FACT HE ENDED UP NOT GOING BACK AT ALL AND
RETIRED RETROACTIVELY TO FEBRUARY OF 1999 AS A RESULT.
>> Stephen: OKAY?
IN 2002 HE RETIRED RETROACTIVELY BACK TO 1999.
(APPLAUSE) SO IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
SO HE WASN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRING ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE JOBS WERE OUTSOURCED.
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR RETROACTIVELY NOT HIRING THEM.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I, I THINK THIS IS GREAT.
THIS WHOLE THING MAKES ROMNEY UNBEATABLE.
BECAUSE IF MITT WINS IN NOVEMBER, HE'S BEATEN OBAMA.
AND IF OBAMA WINS IN NOVEMBER, MITT CAN JUST SAY HE RETROACTIVELY RETIRED FROM THE RACE IN 2009.
(APPLAUSE) NOW COME TO THINK OF IT-- COME TO THINK OF IT, FOLKS, IF MITT CAN RETROACTIVELY
RETIRE YEARS AGO, WHY CAN'T I PROACTIVELY RETIRE RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN I WOULD STILL BE THE HOST AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
OF "THE COLBERT REPORT" FOR A COUPLE PORE YEARS, YOU KNOW, GETS ALL THE NONE IN THE BANK.
BUT I'M OFFICIALLY RETIRED AS OF NOW.
THAT WAY I CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING "THE COLBERT REPORT" SAYS OR DOES.
FOR INSTANCE, HITLER HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS.
(LAUGHTER) A LOT OF BAD ONES, A LOT OF BAD IDEAS.
ACTUALLY NOT THAT MANY, JUST TWO, TWO REALLY, REALLY BAD IDEAS.
OKAY.
BUT SOME GOOD.
LET'S NOT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER.
BY THE WAY, BABY WITH THE BATHWATER, ONE OF THE TWO BAD IDEAS.
(LAUGHTER) ALSO VERY NICE EYES.
WOW.
(APPLAUSE) I GOT TO TELL YOU I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE THE GUY WITHOUT GETS THE HATE MAIL FOR THAT.
LUCKILY, BY NOW, I WILL HAVE BEEN RETIRED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
