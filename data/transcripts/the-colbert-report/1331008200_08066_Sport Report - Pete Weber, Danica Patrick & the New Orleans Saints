(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS I LOVE BOWLING BECAUSE IT HAS THE PERSONALITIES.
AND THERE'S NO BIGGER DIVA THAN PRO BOWLING LEGEND PETE WEBER WHO JUST WON HIS FIFTH U.S. OPEN
AND THEN RUB IT HAD UNIVERSE'S NOSE IN IT.
>> AND HE GOT IT!
>> THAT IS RIGHT!
I DID IT!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT'S RIGHT!
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
I AM!
>> Stephen: YEAH!
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
I AM!
WHO EDES'S YOUR DADDY!
THAT'S WHY!
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS.
JAKE, IT'S CHINATOWN!
THIS IS THE SCORE REPORT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST UP, NASCAR.
FOLKS, I'M A HUGE FAN OF WATCHING PEOPLE DRIVE IN A CIRCLE 500 TIMES.
SO I WAS STOKED FOR LAST WEEK'S DAYTONA 500 AND THE SPRINT CUP DEBUT OF DANICA PATRICK.
SHE IS AN INSPIRATION TO ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS OUT THERE DRIVING 200 MILES AN HOUR.
UNFORTUNATELY A CRASH KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE RUNNING BUT SHE'S STILL MAKING NEWS THANKS TO A
FOX 5 SAN DIEGO NEWS LEADER.
>> DANICA PATRICK IS SUCH A PRETTY GIRL AND SHE MAKES A LOT OF MONEY IN SPONSORSHIPS BECAUSE
OF THIS.
WHAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE IS THAT SHE'S SEXY AND SHE KNOWS IT.
>> I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN YOU'RE REFERRING TO A GIRL,
A FEMALE ATHLETE IN PARTICULAR,
THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THE WORD "SEXY." THERE ANY OTHER WORD THAT YOU
CAN USE TO DESCRIBE ME?
>> OH, I GOT A FEW WORDS.
STARTS WITH A "B" AND IT'S NOT BEAUTIFUL.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: IS IT BAH-SEXY?
NOW HIS COMMENT HAS GONE VIRAL AND HE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BUT I'M SORRY, DAN CAR, HE'S A
FRIEND AND HE'S GOT A POINT HERE.
IF YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS SEXY, DON'T POSE FOR THE "SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED" SWIMSUIT ISSUE OR F.H.M. OR TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF IN THAT GO DADDY GOT COM
COMMERCIAL OR SHOWER WITH A WOMAN IN THAT OTHER GODADDY.COM COMMERCIAL.
I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE AND SAY SHE MAY HAVE GO-DADDY ISSUES.
(LAUGHTER) YOUNG LADY, IF YOU WANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS COMPETITOR,
YOU STICK TO YOUR SPORT THE WAY MALE ATHLETES DO, LIKE TOM BRADY.
ALEX RODRIGUEZ.
AND DAVID BECKHAM.
HERE HE IS JUST PLAYING SOCCER.
(LAUGHTER) I THINK THAT STOCK ROOM IS CERTAINLY SEEING SOME BALLS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND BECKHAM APPEARS TO BE SPENDING IT.
(LAUGHTER) NEXT FINALLY COMES THE MOST DAMNING N.F.L. SCANDAL IN YEARS
NOT INVOLVING THE WORD "SEX BOAT." JIM?
>> THERE ARES IS A BREWING SCANDAL INVOLVEING THE N.F.L.'S NEW ORLEANS SAINTS.
SAINTS PLAYERS MAINTAINED A BOUNTY OVER THE LAST FEW SEASONS INCLUDING PAYMENTS FOR PLAYERS
WHO TARGETED OPPONENTS WITH THE AIM OF INJURING THEM.
>> THE SUNS REACHED AS HIGH AS $50,000.
PLAYERS RECEIVED $1,500 FOR KNOCKING PLAYERS OUT OF THE GAME AND A THOUSAND FOR A CARTOFF.
>> WHAT'S SHOCKING ABOUT THIS IS THAT GUYS WERE GETTING PAID TO
GO OUT AND KNOCK PEOPLE OUT OF THE GAME.
>> Stephen: YES, I AM SHOCKED,
SHOCKED, I TELL YOU THAT N.F.L.
PLAYERS WERE BEING PAID BONUSES TO INJURE EACH OTHER!
THEY'RE ALREADY PAID A BASALRY TO INJURE EACH OTHER.
I'M SICKENED BY ALLEGATIONS THAT IN A PLAYOFF GAME IN 2010 SAINT'S DEFENSIVE CAPTAIN
JONATHAN VILMA OFFERED $10,000 IN CASH TO ANY PLAYER WHO KNOCKED VIKINGS QUARTERBACK
BRETT FAVRE OUT OF THE GAME.
THE IRONY, OF COURSE, IS THAT LATER THAT YEAR BRETT FAVRE WAS KNOCKED OUT OF FOOTBALL WHEN HE
TWEETED HIS OWN HELMETED WARRIOR.
(LAUGHTER) I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU KEPT THE KIDS UP FOR THAT ONE.
I ALSO HOPE THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE ARE PUNISHED, THE N.F.L. CONTINUES ITS EMPHASIS ON
SAFETY AND THOSE DEFENSIVE PLAYERS LEARN TO TACKLE THE RIGHT WAY THAT ENDS UP IN THE
TOP TEN HITS MONTAGE ON THE N.F.L..COM!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
