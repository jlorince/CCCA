WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN
THE EMPEROR OF MALADIES, A
BIOGRAPHY OF CANCER.
AND IT IS SAID AT THE
END-- SAD, CANCER GET HITS
BY A BUS.
PLEASE WELCOME SIDDHARTHA
MUKHERJEE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
NOW AS I SAID, YOUR BOOK IS
A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING,
THE EMPEROR OF ALL MALADIES,
A BIOGRAPHY OF CANCER.
NOW I KNOW THIS IS ABOUT
CANCER BUT LET'S KEEP IT
LIGHT, OKAY.
WHAT, WHAT I SAID OVER THERE
ABOUT CANCER GETTING HIT BY
A BUS, WHY THAT MAKES SENSE
TO ME IS THAT CATCH
CERTIFICATE FEELS LIKE AN
ALIEN LIVING THING IN A
BODY.
IT'S DOING WHAT IT WANTS.
IS IT LIKE ANOTHER LIVING
THING IN YOU?
>> IN SOME WAYS IT IS, BUT
WHAT'S REALLY, REALLY TRICKY,
AND THIS WAS THE REALIZATION
THAT SENT A REAL CHILL UP
THE SPINES OF ALL THE
BIOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS
SINCE THE 197 0S.
WHAT IS REALLY TRICKY IS
THAT THE VERY GENES THAT
CAUSE YOUR NORMAL CELLS TO
GROW, IF YOU CORRUPT THOSE
GENES, THAT IS WHAT CAUSES
CANCER TO GROW.
THE VERY GENES THAT CAUSE
YOUR EMBRYO TO GROW, IF YOU
CORRUPT THOSE GENES, IF
THOSE GENES STOP WORKING
PROPERLY, THAT'S WHAT MAKE
CANCER CELLS GROW.
SO IT IS NOT AN ALIEN BEING
IN THE SENSE IT IS NOT
COMPLETELY OUTSIDE YOUR BODY,
COMES FROM THE VERY GENETIC
MATERIAL THAT IS OUTSIDE
YOUR BODY.
>> Stephen: BUT EVERY CANCER
CELL SAY LIVING CELL.
>> IT IS A LIVING CELL.
>> Stephen: CAN CANCER GET
SICK.
CAN CANCER GET A DISEASE?
>> IF YOU GIVE THE RIGHT
KIND OF TREATMENT, FOR
EXAMPLE, THE PROPER KIND OF
CHEMOTHERAPY YOU CAN MAKE
CANCER CELLS SICK AND KILL
THE CANCER CELLS WHILE
SPARING THE NORMAL CELLS.
AND THAT IS THE DREAM.
THAT IS THE GOAL OF ALL
CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY IS TO
TRY TO KILL CANCER WHILE
SPARING THE NORMAL.
>> Stephen: NOW WE HAVE HAD
A SORT OF WAR ON CANCER.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: SINCE 1971, IN
THE UNITED STATES.
WHAT ARE OUR WEAPONS IN THE
WAR.
>> WELL, THE MAJOR WEAPON IN
THE WAR IS PREVENTION.
IF WE COULD PREVENT CANCERS
FROM EVEN HAPPENING WHEN WE
WOULD BE REALLY TURN THIS
WAR AROUND.
>> Stephen: HOW DO WE DO
THAT WHAT DO I DO TO NOT
GET-- BY THE WAY WHAT
PERCENTAGE OF
AMERICANS-- LIKE AMERICAN
MEN WHAT PERCENTAGE GET
CANCER.
>> WELL, ONE IN TWO MEN WILL
BE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN
AMERICA.
>> Stephen: ONE IN TWO MEN.
>> Stephen: THAT MEANS ONE
OF THE TWO OF US.
>> THAT COULD MEAN ONE OF
THE OF TWO US-- .
>> Stephen: I'LL FLIP YOU
FOR.
SO WHAT CAN I DO TO NOT GET
CANCER.
>> WELL, YOU COULD BEGIN BY
NOT SMOKING.
>> Stephen: I DON'T.
>> YOU COULD MAINTAIN A
HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, INCLUDING
A DIET THAT-- .
>> Stephen: BACON?
>> DOES THAT INCLUDE SMOKED
MEATS.
>> IN GREAT MODERATION.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> AND YOU KNOW, WE NOW KNOW
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN
BEHAVIORS LIKE EXPOSURE TO
CERTAIN VIRUSES, IN CERTAIN
POPULATIONS WILL CAUSE
CANCER.
SO FOR INSTANCE,
PAPILLOMAVIRUS IS A CANCER
THAT CAUSES CERVICAL CANCER,
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED VIRUS
SO AGAIN-- .
>> Stephen: I THINK RICK
PERRY CURED THAT, PRETTY
SURE HE CURED THAT ONE.
>> WELL, YOU COULD
GET-- CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN GET
VACCINATED AGAINST THAT FORM
OF CANCER.
>> Stephen: HOW OLD IS OUR
KNOWLEDGE OF CANCER?
>> WELL, IT'S SURPRISING.
YOU THINK THAT CANCER IS A
MODERN DISEASE BUT IT ISN'T.
>> Stephen: I DO.
>> BUT IT ISN'T, IN FACT,
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE
VERY OLDEST MEDICAL
MANUSCRIPTS THAT WE HAVE,
2,500 BC CONTAINS A CASE
THAT RESEMBLES BREAST
CANCER.
THAT IS AN EGYPTIAN
MANUSCRIPT SO, IT'S NOT ONLY
ONE OF THE OLD DISEASES,
IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST
DISEASES PROBABLY THAT WE
EVER KNEW ABOUT.
>> DO WE KNOW WHETHER WE GET
IT MORE, I THINK WE THINK OF
IT AS A MODERN DISEASE T
FEELS LIKE MORE AND MORE
THINGS GIVE US CANCER.
THAT IS SORT OF IN MY, THAT
IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO ME
AND WHAT IT FEELS LIKE IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHATEVER
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY.
SO-- DO WE HAVE GOOD RECORDS
BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION OF PEOPLE GETTING
CANCER?
>> WE HAVE RECORDS, THEY'RE
NOT GREAT BUT WE HAVE SOME
RECORDS.
HERE IS THE MAJOR DRIVER IS
AGING.
CANCER IN MANY CANCERS ARE
AGE-RELATED.
FOR INSTANCE BREAST CANCER,
VERY, VERY DEEPLY
AGE-RELATED.
PROSTATE CAN SER VERY DEEPLY
AGE-RELATED.
>> Stephen: IS THE FACT THAT
WE LIVE LONGER NOW MEAN WE
ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET
CANCER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'VE KILLED OFF OTHER
KILLERS.
>> Stephen: WOW.
SO MEDICINE IS OUR OWN WORST
ENEMY.
>> IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
>> Stephen: YES, I JUST
SPOKE IN THAT MANNER.
(LAUGHTER)
ARE WE GOING TO CURE THIS
THING?
ARE WE ON THE ROAD TO CURING
CANCER.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AGAIN, WE'LL PREVENT SOME.
WE'LL BE ABLE TO TREAT SOME.
WE'LL BE ABLE TO CURE SOME
AND IT WILL BE A BIG
SPECTRUM.
NOT EVERY CANCER WILL BE THE
SAME.
FOR INSTANCE CHILDHOOD
LEUKEMIA WAS 100 PERCENT
LETHAL IN THE 19 '50s.
WE NOW CURE -- 0% OF THOSE
CHILDREN WITH-- TESS
PARTICULAR YOU LAR CANCER
WAS 100LET AG WE NOW CURE
MANY OF THEM.
LIMB FOAMAN, EVEN BREAST
CANCER IT SAY SPECTRUM, SOME
WE WILL TREAT, SOME WE WILL
CURE.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
EVERYTHING DOW TO TRY TO PUT
AN ENDING TO THIS BOOK.
>> I TRY TO WRITE THE
ENDING.
>> Stephen: DOCTOR, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
