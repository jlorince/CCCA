YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
CALLED "TRAVELS IN SIBERIA."
IT'S A SEQUEL.
PLEASE WELCOME IAN FRAZIER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU,
MR. FRAZIER.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> NICE TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: NOW, I GOT TO TAKE
YOU TO TASK RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: GET YOUR GUARD UP.
TRAVELS IN SIBERIA IS THE NAME
OF THE BOOK, IAN FRAZIER.
WHY SIBERIA, SIR?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA'S
FROZEN HELLSCAPE?
GO TO NEBRASKA THIS TIME OF
YEAR.
IT IS JUST CORN STUBBLE AND
DESOLATION.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, I WENT TO NEBRASKA,
>> Stephen: YOU DID?
>> YEAH, AND OUT WEST, AND I
JUST KEPT GOING.
I KEPT WESTERING.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
YOU MUST HAVE PICKED UP SOME
SPEED WHEN YOU GOT TO THE BERING
STRAIT BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD
TO SKIP A STONE ACROSS THAT
THING.
>> IT'S A PLACE OF HORRIBLE
WEATHER.
IT'S TRUE.
I WENT THERE A BUNCH.
>> Stephen: YOU WENT THERE
FIVE TIMES.
>> I WENT TO SIBERIA FIVE TIMES.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU PART OF A
FREQUENT GULAG PROGRAM?
WHY THE FASCINATION WITH WHAT WE
AMERICANS KNOW IS A FROZEN,
DESOLATE, ENVIRONMENTALLY DEG
DATED HELLSCAPE?
>> WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE FEW AND
FAR BETWEEN ON THIS SHOW.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WE WESTER AND WE RIDE BOO THE
SUNSET.
WE GO WEST.
>> Stephen: YES, WE DO.
>> RUSSIANS GO EAST.
>> Stephen: THE PLANET SPINS
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION?
>> WELL, THEY LOOK EAST.
THEIR EMPIRE WENT EAST.
>> Stephen: MOSCOW OVER HERE.
GO EAST, YOUNG MAN.
>> WE HAD A WILD WEST.
THEY HAD A WILD EAST.
>> Stephen: IT STILL IS A WILD
EAST OUT THERE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: TELL US ABOUT THE
SIBERIA AMERICA DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT, WHICH IS ALL OF IT, BUT
TELL ME ABOUT THE PART YOU WENT
THROUGH.
IS IT A FROZEN HELL SCAPE?
>> NO, IT'S INCREDIBLY HOT IN
THE SUMMER AND JUST FULL OF
MOSQUITOES.
IT'S FAR FROM A...
>> Stephen: DON'T OVERSELL IT.
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
DANGER OF MY BEING A ADVOCATE OF
IT, BUT IT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR
AN ADVENTURE.
IT'S PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN GOING TO TEST THEMSELVES
AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE, AND
THERE'S A LOT OF BOOKS ABOUT
SIBERIA, SO I'M PART OF A GENRE
OF BOOKS ABOUT SIGH BEERA.
>> Stephen: BUT NONE LIKE
THIS.
>> NONE LIKE THIS?
>> Stephen: I WOULD SAY NONE
LIKE THIS.
>> OKAY, NONE LIKE THIS.
>> Stephen: IF YOU WANT TO
SELL SOME BOOKS, I WOULD SAY
"NONE LIKE THIS."
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I JUST PHOTO PHOTOCOPIED THE
LAST ONE I READ, PUT IT IN A
BINDER.
WHAT'S THE DRAW FOR YOU?
WERE YOU TESTING YOURSELF?
DID YOU WANT THE SEE WHAT YOU
WERE MADE OF?
>> ADVENTURE WAS THE DRAW.
IT WAS OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME.
THE SOVIETS HAD IT CLOSED.
>> Stephen: PUTIN GOES OUT
THERE ALL THE TIME.
>> ALL THE TIME.
>> Stephen: DID HE TRY TO
BRING YOU DOWN WITH A TANK
QUILLIZER GUN?
HE GOES OUT THERE SHIRTLESS AND
PRINCE DOWN TIGERS WITH A
TRANQUILIZER.
>> THIS IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE.
THE CZARS NEVER WENT TO SIBERIA.
THEY KNEW, DON'T GO THERE.
PUTIN HAS MADE SIBERIA PART OF
RUSSIA AGAIN.
HE'S VERY INTERESTING IN
DEVELOPED SIBERIA.
>> Stephen: IS THAT LIKE
REAGAN WITH HIS WESTERN WHITE
HOUSE, OUT THERE SPLITTING WOOD.
IS THE IMAGE OF SIBERIA A PAUL
BUNYAN IMAGE FOR THEM?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT MAKES HIM LOOK TOUGH.
>> Stephen: DO THEY HAVE
LEGENDARY FOLK FIGURES LIKE PAUL
BUNYAN AND THE BIG BLUE OX?
>> YEAH, THEY DO, AND PUTIN
WASSING WITH ONE OF THEM.
HE WAS ENACTING.
>> Stephen: THAT AND HE KIND
OF DOES LIKE PLAY GIRL CENTER
FOLDS AT THE SAME TIME,
SEMINAKED ON HORSEBACK.
>> HE'S VERY BUFF.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME.
GUN TO MY HEAD, SURE.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> OKAY.
GOOD.
>> Stephen: HE'D BE A STRONG
LEADER IN 2012 OVER HERE.
>> I THINK HE'S A VERY STRONG
LEADER PERMANENTLY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'LL EVER
GET RID OF HIM.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SEE
ANYTHING OVER THERE?
THEY GOT GRIZZLIES GALORE OVER
THERE, RIGHT?
DO THEY?
THEY HAVE SOME WEARS OVER THERE
>> EVER
>> THEY HAVE BEARS.
I DIDN'T SEE ANY BEARS.
>> Stephen: FIVE TRIPS, NO
BEARS IN
>> WILDLIFE IS NOT ABUNDANT
THERE BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
WHERE YOU GO YOU DON'T SEE THAT
MUCH WILDLIFE, NO.
>> Stephen: I SEE HERE AT ONE
POINT YOU DROVE ACROSS... WHAT
DID YOU DRIVE IN?
>> I DROVE IN A RENAULT DELIVERY
VAN.
>> Stephen: YOU DROVE IN A
RENAULT?
A DIESEL RENAULT AND IT MADE IT
OUT OF THE PARKING LOT?
>> NOT REALLY.
WE HAD TO KEEP RESTARTING IT.
IT WENT FROM ST. PETERSBURG TO
VLADIVOSTOK, 15,000 KILOMETERS
INCLUDING SIDE TRIPS.
IT SERVED US, BUT IT WAS KIND OF
A PIECE OF JUNK.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY AT ONE
POINT YOU DROVE FOR 52 HOURS AND
NEVER LEFT...
>> I WAS ON A TRAIN FOR 52
HOURS, AND THE FOREST IS JUST
LIKE THIS WAS IN THE WINTER, SO
IT JUST WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS CARDS
UPON CHRISTMAS CARDS.
THERE'S IN FRAME.
IT JUST KEEPS ON COMING AT YOU.
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE HOW BIG
THE RUSSIAN FOREST IS.
>> Stephen: IS IT BEING
EXPLOITED IN IMPROPER WAYS?
>> IMPROPER WAYS?
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW, AS MAN
DOMINATES NATURE, ARE THEY
PROPERLY DOMINATING SIBERIA?
>> THEY'RE DOMINATING.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE ALSO
TRAVELED ACROSS THE WESTERN
UNITED STATES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHERE ELSE ARE YOU
GOING?
YOU KNOW, MARS WOULD BE A GREAT
PLACE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
>> I'M ALMOST 60 YEARS OLD.
>> Stephen: OH, HAVE I GOT AN
OFFER FOR YOU.
IAN FRAZIER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
IAN FRAZIER, THE BOOK IS
