IS SO WONDERFUL TO HEAR THATFROM THIS AUDIENCE.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, HEROES!
THANK YOU, NATION, THANKYOU!
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARECHECKING THE PAPERS AND
LOOKING AT THE TVs THERE'SJUST SO MUCH SAD NEWS OUT
THERE THESE DAYS THATTONIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO KICK
THINGS OFF WITH A HOT SHOT,A PICK ME UP FROM WHAT I
LIKE TO CALL STEPHENCOLBERT'S SMILE FILE.
TONIGHT ON THE SMILE FILETYRANNICAL NORTH KOREAN
DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN.
FOLKS, THIS MAD MAN LIVES ACONSTANT STATE OF STERN
DISAPPROVAL.
BUT EVEN BEFORE HE CAME TOPOWER JONG UN MADE NO TIME
FOR FRIVOLITY.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS ACTUALCNN INTERVIEW WITH HIS OLD
BORDER SCHOOL ROOMMATE FROMSWITZERLAND.
>> DID YOU GO OUT IN THENIGHT, YOU NEVER GO OUT, ON
DISCO OR MAKE PARTY, NEVER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, HENOT EVEN AS A TEEN HE NEVER
GO OUT ON DISCO OR MAKEPARTY.
I BET HE NEVER EVEN GO OUTON MOVIE OR MAKE BOWLING.
SO SAD.
BUT FOLKS, IT TURNS OUT THATBENEATH THAT SAD EXPRESSION
KIM JUNG-UN JUST MIGHT BE KIMJUNG FUN.
BECAUSE NORTH KOREAN STATEMEDIA, YOUR ALBINO SEA CUCUMBER
NEWS LEADER, HAS RELEASEDNEW PHOTOS OF THE DEAR
LEADER TOURING AN INDUSTRIALLUBRICANT FACTORY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THATSMILE!
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM ORANYONE, REALLY, SO
TRANSPORTED BY THE PURE JOYOF LUBE.
(LAUGHTER)NOTHING PUTS A GRIN ON THAT
MACHINE'S FACE LIKE EXTRUDEDSEMI SOLIDS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE GUY NEXTTO HIM IS SUCH A SOUR PUS.
I MEAN HE GETS TO SPEND 16HOURS A DAY WATCHING THAT
LUBE.
(LAUGHTER)IT SURE IS NICE TO SEE UN
FINALLY LET HIS HAIR DOWN.
HE'S USUALLY SO SERIOUS WHENHE'S LOOKING AT THINGS.
THINGS LIKE FRUIT.
MATTRESSES.
ACCORDIONS, CHUROS, WATERSLIDES, REGULAR SLIDES,
FLOORING OPTIONS AND WHERETHEY THREW HIS UNCLE'S BODY.
(APPLAUSE)BUT NONE-- NONE OF
THOSE-- NONE OF THOSE HASBROUGHT HIM THE SIMPLE LIFE
AFFIRMING PLEASURE OF LUBE.
AND I GET IT, I ALSO ENJOYWATCHING NONDESCRIPT VISCOUS
GOO BEING FORCE THREW ATUBE.
I COULD SPEND HOURS AT THE SOFTSERVE PUMP.
AND UN'S NOT JUST SMILINGFROM CHIN TO CHIN OVER A
SINGLE LUBE EJECTER, HE'SSMILING ALL THROUGH THE
LUBRICANT FACTORY FROM THELUBE LOADING FLOOR TO THE
STATE OF THE ART LUBECOMMAND DECK WHERE THE
LATEST NANOTECHNOLOGY ANDADVANCED SUPERCOMPUTERS ARE
HARNESSED TO INSURANCE THATLUBE GO THROUGH TUBE.
AND THIS FACTORY IS A HAPPYPLACE FOR KIM JUNG-UN FOR A
VERY PERSONAL REASON.
IT REPRESENTS THE COMPLETIONOF HIS FATHER'S KIM JUNG IL'S
VISION.
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO STATEREPORTS UN SAID WITH DEEP
EMOTION I FEEL VERY SORRYFOR FAILING IT TO SHOW HIM
THIS MODERN SPEND DIDFACTORY EVEN ONCE.
THIS FACTORY IS A POSTHUMOUSONE.
I MEAN, THAT GETS YOU RIGHTIN THE LUBE PUMP.
HE AND HIS FATHER SHARED ALOVE OF SLAVE-MADE LUBE.
DON'T WE ALL.
AND THAT'S THE SMILE FILE.
