OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUSTMICHELLE, I'M ALSO NOT A
HUGE FAN OF BARACK.
FROM DAY ONE I HAVE VOWED TOSTOP OBAMACARE OR DIE
TRYING.
AND KNOWING MY LUCK I'DALMOST DIE AND THEN GET
NURSED BACK TO LIFE BYOBAMACARE.
AND FOLKS, I AM NOT ALONE INMY CRUSADE.
YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICANLEADERSHIP ANNOUNCED THEIR
SIMPLE YET SIMPLE MINDEDPLAN TO CRIPPLE ALL
GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE.
>> THE GROUNDWORK HAS BEENSET FOR A MONUMENTAL
SHOWDOWN ON CAPITOL HILL ANDIT ALL COMES DOWN TO A VERY
SIMPLE FORMULA, EITHERDEMOCRATS VOTE TO DEFUND THE
TRAIN WRECK THAT ISOBAMACARE OR THEY WILL RISK
SHUTTING DOWN THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT.
>> THIS WEEK THE HOUSE WILLPASS A CR, THAT-- OBAMACARE.
>> CAN YOU SEE THE SMILE ONMY FACE.
I'M SO HAPPY BECAUSE I THINKWE'RE GETTING TO A CONSENSUS
WITH THE REPUBLICANS.
I THINK WE CAN TAKE AVICTORY LAP.
>> Stephen: YES, A VICTORYLAP BECAUSE OBAMACARE IS
DEAD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WEATHER OR NOT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WEATHER OR NOT!
WEATHER OR NOT!
-- WHOOO!
>> MAYBE.
BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL AVIEW WRINKLES TO IRON OUT
BEFORE THIS BRAVE ACT OFEXTORTION TAKES EFFECT.
>> YOU KNOW THAT THESETHINGS PROBABLY WON'T PASS
THE DEMOCRATICALLYCONTROLLED SENATE AND THE
PRESIDENT WOULD VETO IT EVENIF IT DID.
>> THEY'RE PUTTING SOMETHINGIN THERE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
A NONSTARTER.
THIS IS LIKE SAYING WE CANPASS A BUDGET IF YOU CAN
PROVE THERE'S LIFE ON MARS.
>> Stephen: BUT IF THERE ISLIFE ON MARS AT LEAST IT'S
GOING TO HAVE TO BUY ITS OWNHEALTH CARE.
AND FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TOSTOPPING OBAMA CARE THERE IS
NO TIME TO LOSE BECAUSE THESTOOL SAMPLE IS ABOUT TO HIT
THE FAN.
>> TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY THEFIRST AMERICANS CAN START
SIGNING UP FOR THE EXCHANGESUNDER OBAMACARE.
IT'S THE FIRST OF OCTOBER.
>> Stephen: OBAMACARE ISCOMING, FOLKS, RUN FOR YOUR
LIVES, NO, WAIT, DON'T RUNFOR YOUR LIVES, THAT WILL
MAKE YOU HEALTHIER ANDTHAT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, WORSE, WORSE-- GOT TO
REMEMBER THAT.
AND FOLKS, WORSE THAN THECOSTS OR THE BUREAUCRATS ON
THE DEATH PANELS, THE MOSTDANGEROUS THING ABOUT
OBAMACARE IS THAT PEOPLEMIGHT LIKE IT.
(LAUGHTER)AS CONSERVATIVE WRITER BYRON
YORK RECENTLY YORKED, THEWHITE HOUSE KNOWS THAT ONCE
THOSE PAYMENTS BEGIN REPEALOG BAMACARE WILL NO LONGER
BE AN ABSTRACT QUESTION OFREMOVING LEGISLATION NOT YET
IN EFFECT.
INSTEAD IT WILL BE A VERYREAL MATTER OF TAKING MONEY
AWAY FROM PEOPLE IT IS VERY,VERY HARD TO DO THAT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE THEOLD SAYING, GIVE A MAN A
FISH, HE'LL EAT FOR A DAY.
TRY TO TAKE THAT FISH AWAYAGAIN AND THAT GUY WILL
[BLEEP] YOU UP
