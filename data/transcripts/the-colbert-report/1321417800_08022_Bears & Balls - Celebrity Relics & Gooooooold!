(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, IF YOU'RE POOR, DON'T
BLAME WALL STREET.
THERE'S ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY OUT
THERE FOR HALF THE COUNTRY TO BE
IN THE TOP 1%.
(LAUGHTER)
WITH MY HELP AND THE HELP OF THE
BIG RED BUTTON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SELL YOUR CHILDREN FOR CAB
FARE!
>> Stephen: THIS IS STEPHEN
COLBERT'S "BEARS AND BALLS."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP ON "BEARS AND BALLS," A
LOT OF INVESTORS ARE RUNNING
SCARED BUT THERE'S ONE
INVESTMENT GUARANTEED TO RETAIN
ITS VALUE,, BOW LA MONKEYS.
NO?
MAGIC BEANS.
NO?
CELEBRITY RELICS.
YES.
CELEBRITY RELICS.
EVERYBODY WANTS DOROTHY'S RUBY
SLIPPERS, MADONNA'S CONE BRA, OR
J. EDGAR HOOVERS RUBY SLIPPERS
AND CONE BRA.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A
CHUNK OF CHANGE ON CELEBRITIES,
YOU NEED A CHUNK OF CELEBRITY.
CASE IN POINT: JOHN LENNON'S
ABSCESSED TOOTH RECENTLY FETCHED
MORE THAN
$31,000 AT AUCTION.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AND I'M SURE JOHN LENNON WOULD
APPROVE OF THE BUYING AND
SELLING OF BODY PARTS.
WHEN HE SANG "I WANT TO HOLD
YOUR HAND" HE NEVER SAID IT HAD
TO BE ATTACHED TO HIS BODY.
AND, FOLKS, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A
BETTER TIME INVEST IN THINGS
THAT FALL OFF CELEBRITIES.
FOR INSTANCE, I AM PROUD TO
OFFER THIS BABY FOOD JAR FULL OF
DANNY DEVITO'S DOE NAIL
CLIPPINGS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
I GOT THEM WITH NOTHING MORE
THAN A PAIN OF CLIPPERS, A RAG,
AND A JAR OF CHLOROFORM.
BY THE WAY, DANNY, YOU SNORE.
OF COURSE, ANY CELEBRITY BODY
APARTMENT INVESTMENTS THERE ARE
RISKS.
I LOST MILLIONS WHEN THE ERIC
ROBERTS BUBBLE BURST.
AND IT WASN'T EASY GETTING A
PIECE OF HIM.
>> THEY TOOK MY THUMB!
>> Stephen: HEY, I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD BE CRYING.
I CAN'T UNLOAD THIS THING NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S A SAD STORY.
THE SAFEST INVESTMENT OF ALL...
>> CRYSTAL METH!
>> Stephen: NO.
>> SHAVED DWARF PORNOGRAPHY.
>> Stephen: NOT IN THE LOWER 48.
>> GOLD!
>> Stephen: YES!
GOLD!
I LOVE EVERYTHING GOLD RELATED.
GOLD BOUILLON, GOLD COINS, GOLD
BOND.
BECAUSE A FRESHLY POWDERED NUT
SACK NEVER GOES DOWN IN VALUE.
AND OF COURSE THE INVESTMENT
COMPANY GOLDLINE INTERVAGSNAL.
GOLDLINE HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY
EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE FOX NEWS
LIKE MONICA CROWLEY, LAURA
INGRAM, SEAN HANNITY, AND
COMMODITIES ANALYST FOR FOX
BUSINESS, KLONDIKE ZEKE.
>> GOLD!
GOLD!
GOLD!
(LAUGHTER)
AND LIKE EVERY OTHER AD ON T.V.
TELLING ME HOW TO GET RICH QUICK
I TRUST GOLD MINES.
WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED TO
HEAR THIS.
>> LOCAL OFFICIALS?
N LOS ANGELES HAVE FILED A
19-COUNT CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
ALLEGING MISDEMEANOR FRAUD AND
THEFT BY THE COMPANY.
>> THE COMPANY TOUTED GOLD
BOUILLON, KEY EXECUTIVES
CONSPIRE TOGETHER TO CHEAT AND
DEFRAUD CONSUMERS BY STEERING
THEM TO HUGELY OVERPRICED
SO-CALLED COLLECTIBLE COINS-- A
BAIT-AND-SWITCH.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?
I INVESTED WITH GOLDLINE AND THE
COINS THEY SENT ME ARE BOTH
SHINY GOLD AND FILLED WITH
DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS GOING TO GROW MY BOTTOM
LINE.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, IF THE GOLDLINE
EXECUTIVES ARE CONVICTED, THEY
COULD FACE A YEAR IN PRISON FOR
EACH OF THE 19 CHARGES AGAINST
THEM.
WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT I'M
OFFERING THEM A UNIQUE
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.
HI, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT.
ARE YOU A FORMER GOLDLINE
EXECUTIVE FACING JAIL?
THESE ARE SUCH UNCERTAIN TIMES
IN THE PRISON ECONOMY, IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO GET SHANKED IN THE
MESS LINE, YOU'LL NEED A
RELIABLE INVESTMENT.
SAFE, SECURE CIGARETTES FROM
SMOKELINE.
(LAUGHTER)
CIGARETTES ARE VALUED BY
EVERYONE FROM THE ARYAN
BROTHERHOOD TO THE LATIN KINGS.
AND CIGARETTES ARE A FUNGABLE
COMMODITY, THEY CAN BE USED TO
BUY EVERYTHING FROM TOILET HOOCH
TO INSURANCE AGAINST BEING BEAT
WITHIN A PILLOW CASE FULL OF
SOAP.
BEST OF ALL, YOU GOLD LINE EXECS
WILL APPRECIATE THAT THEY'RE NOT
REALLY CIGARETTES AT ALL, JUST
CUTUP DRINKING STRAWS STUFFED
WITH SAW DUST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SMOKELINE, BECAUSE
