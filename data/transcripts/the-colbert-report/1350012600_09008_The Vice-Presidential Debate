( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOLY COW.
WOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE -- [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] OH, MY GOSH.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I DON'T -- FOLKS -- I DON'T KNOW IF CAN TELL WITH A JUST HAPPENED BUT I JUST GOT BURIED UNDERNEATH AN AVALANCHE OF LOVE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
A LOVE-ALANCH, WILL YOU WILL.
NATION, TONIGHT WAS THE BIG VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND PAUL RYAN IN DANVILLE, KENTUCKY.
THE WHOOP-ASS IN THE BLUE GRASS, THE BARE-KNUCKY IN KENTUCKY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. NOR WILL I EVER.
IT'S A VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FOR THE RECORD, I'M BETTING -- I KNOW WHAT WHO IS GOING TO WIN BECAUSE THE KEY TO WINNING ONE OF THESE DEBATES IS TO LOWER
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOUR SPEAKING SKILLS.
AND BIDEN'S BEEN DOING THAT FOR FOUR YEARS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLUS HE'S GONNA WIN.
BECAUSE THE LIBERAL MEDIA FIX IS IN.
>> CRITICS RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE MODERATOR IN TOMORROW'S VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CLEAR POLITICAL BIAS.
IT TURNS OUT PRESIDENT OBAMA ATTENDED ABC CORRESPONDENT MARTHA RADDATZ FIRST WEDDING BACK IN 1991.
THIS THING GOES DEEP, FOLKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
21 YEARS AGO BARACK OBAMA ATTENDED DEBATE MODERATOR.
MARTHA RADDATZ'S WEDDING.
WHO KNOWS WHAT FAVORS WERE EXCHANGED WITH AN EYE TOWARD THE INEVITABLE FUTURE DEBATE.
THEY ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING.
HE KNEW THAT.
PANINI PRESS WOULD PAY OFF EVENTUALLY FOR THE RUNNING MATE HE HADN'T MET YET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: FOR TWENTY YEARS, EVERY TIME SHE'S MADE A MONTE CRISTO SHE'S WHISPERED "I OWE YOU, BARACK OBAMA."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND SURE, OBAMA WAS ACTUALLY JUST A LAW SCHOOL CLASSMATE OF RADDATZ'S HUSBAND JULIUS GENACHOWSKI WHO RADDATZ DIVORCED
IN 1997.
BUT WHAT WOMAN DOESN'T LOVE DOING FAVORS FOR HER EX-HUSBAND'S FRIENDS?
