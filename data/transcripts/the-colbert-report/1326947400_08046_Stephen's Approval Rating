SO CLEARLY ROMNEY IS VULNERABLE.
GINGRICH IS RIGHT, WE
CONSERVATIVES NEED A SICKLE
CANDIDATE WHO HAS AN APPEAL ON
NATIONAL LEVEL.
LAST NIGHT PUBLIC POLICY POLLING
RELEASED THEIR LATEST NATIONAL
FAVORABILITY RATING.
EVIDENTLY YOU GOT GINGRICH AT
26%, PAUL AT 27% AND SANTORUM AT
30%, BUT STILL, MITT ROMNEY
LEAVES THEM ALL IN THE DUST AT
35%.
SO, FOLKS, I GUESS ROMNEY'S
GOING TO BE THE GUY WHO -- WAIT
A SECOND.
WAIT.
WHO IS THAT UP AT THE TOP OF THE
POLL WITH A 36% FAVORABILITY
RATING?
STEPHEN COLBERT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WHOO!
BOOM!
36%.
3-6, 3-6.
RIGHT ON TOP.
RIGHT ON TOP.
RIGHT HERE.
FOLKS, 36%.
36%.
THAT'S MORE THAN HALF.
[LAUGHTER]
SO I SAY TONIGHT TO YOU, MY
FELLOW AMERICANS, TO END THE
DIVISION IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, I NOW CALL ON ALL OF THE
OTHER CANDIDATES TO DROP OUT OF
THE RACE.
TO BE CLEAR, I AM NOT A
CANDIDATE, BUT IF ALL THE OTHER
CANDIDATES DID GET OUT, I WOULD
SEE THAT AS A STRONG INDICATION
THAT I SHOULD JUMP IN THE POOL,
AFTER, YOU KNOW, THEY SHOCK IT
WITH CHLORINE, BECAUSE BASED ON
HIS POLL NUMBERS, I'M PRETTY
SURE RICK PERRY DROPPED A TURD
IN THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
THIS IS POLITICS.
POLLS ARE SO IMPERSONAL.
TO GET THE PULSE OF THE VOTERS,
YOU NEED TO BE ON THE GROUND.
SO THIS PAST MONDAY I
PARTICIPATED IN A TOWN HALL IN
MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA,
SPONSORED BY CAFE MOM, A SOCIAL
NETWORKING AND BLOG SITE WITH A
MEMBER BASE OF OVER 1.7 MILLION
MILFGS -- MOTHERS I'D LIKE THE
TO FOCUS GROUP.
THE DAY WAS BEING MODERATED BY
POLITICAL WORDSMITH AND AVID
INDOORSMAN FRAN LUNTZ.
I DID SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
RETAIL POLITICKING, JUST A
ROOMFUL OF VOTERS AND ME UP
CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN A
TWO-MINUTE PRERECORDED VIDEO
MESSAGE, IN WHICH I INTRODUCED
MYSELF AND TALKED ABOUT THE
ISSUES THAT CONCERN ME, AND THEN
FRANK TOOK THE TEMPERATURE OF
THE ROOM.
LET'S SEE HOW I DID.
>> HOW MANY OF YOU WANT HIM TO
RUN?
APPLAUD.
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
HOW MANY OF YOU DON'T WANT HIM
TO RUN.
APPLAUSE.
[STRONGER APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
OKAY.
OKAY.
I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHO CARES ABOUT
GETTING APPROVAL FROM MOM.
[AUDIENCE REACTS PATIENTS
COME ON, THEY MUST HAVE HAD
SOMETHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT ME.
>> GIVE ME A WORD OR PHRASE TO
DESCRIBE STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> I THINK HE'S A DANDY.
>> A DANDY?
>> HE'S A CHARLESTON DANDY.
>> Stephen: A CHARLESTON
DANDY?
OH, OH MY.
OH, LORD, LORD HAVE MERCY.
I DO DECLARE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE IS TALKING ABOUT,
FIDDLE-DEE-DEE.
IS THERE NOT A GENTLEMAN IN THE
ROOM WHO CAN FETCH ME A COLD
GLASS OF CHINA BERRY TEA.
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE THE VAPORS.
I'M NOT HURT.
IN FACT, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
THIS, AND I MEAN THIS, I BELIEVE
THAT SOUTH CAROLINA MOMS ARE A
COVEN OF SHRIEKING BITCHES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
JIMMY, ACTUALLY, THAT'S A LITTLE
TOO HARSH.
LEST EDIT THAT OUT
