>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I DID NOT WANT TO TALK
RACKET WEINER-GATE TONIGHT.
I WAS PLANNING TO REPORT ON THE
DEBT CEILING AND BEN BER NAB I
CAN'S RECENT STATEMENTS ON
MONETARY POLICY, BUT EVERY TIME
I THINK I'M OUT, IT DRAGS ME
BACK IN.
I GUESS ANY OBJECT OF THIS MASS
AND DENSITY HAS ITS OWN
GRAVITATIONAL PULL.
NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A FEW NEW
DEVELOPMENTS OVER HERE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE MAN WHO
BROKE THE STORY, BLOGGER ANDREW
BRITHNEY GOODWIN HAS -- ANDREW
BREITBART HAS A MORE GRAPHIC
PHOTO OF THE WEINER PEENER, BUT
HE'S NOT GOING TO RELEASE IT
BECAUSE HE'S A GOOD GUY.
>> I HAVE THIS PHOTO, BUT I'M
NOT DOING THIS FOR NEFARIOUS
PURPOSES.
I'M TRYING NO DO THE DECENT
THING HERE.
I'M TRYING TO DO THE DECENT
THING HERE AND NOT RELEASE THE
PHOTO.
I'M DOING THIS TO SAVE HIS
FAMILY, OKAY.
>> Stephen: THAT IS CALLED
ETHICS, FOLKS.
AND TODAY THIS GOOD MAN CEMENTED
HIS JOURNALISTIC CREDIBILITY BY
APPEARING ON AMERICA'S MOST
TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS, THE "OPIE
AND ANTHONY" RADIO SHOW.
HE BRAVELY RESISTED THEIR
REQUEST TO SHOW THE PHOTO.
>> WE'D LIKE THE SEE THE PHOTO.
>> YOU WANT TO?
>> Stephen: I'M SURE YOU WANT
TO, OPIE AND ANTHONY.
TOO BAD THIS MAN HAS STAKED HIS
REPUTATION ON THE MORAL CHOICE
TO KEEP THIS PRIVATE FOR THE
MAN'S FAMILY.
>> THAT'S THE FAMOUS...
>> THAT'S THE REAL ONE?
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HE DIDN'T RESIST FOR LONG, BUT
YOU GOT THE THINK, THAT THING IS
BURNING A HOLE IN HIS POCKET.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, HERE'S THE
PHOTO.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
IT'S A LITTLE BLURRY.
I WISH IT WAS BLURRIER FRANKLY.
IT'S BLURRY BECAUSE IT'S A PHONE
PHOTO THAT ANDREW BREITBART HAD
HIS PHONE THAT "OPIE AND
ANTHONY" TOOK A ON PHONE PHOTO OF.
YOU GET THE IDEA.
I DON'T KNOW IF WEINER IS GOING
TO RESIGN.
THAT'S UP TO THE VOTERS IN HIS
DISTRICT TO DECIDE.
BUT WHEN THEY STEP INTO THAT
VOTING BOOTH TO YANK THAT LEVER,
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS WHAT'S
GOING TO COME TO MIND.
IF I WAS HIS OPPONENT, I'D HAVE
THEM ALL PAINTED PINK.
NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU AT HOME
WHO CANNOT SEE IT AT ALL, I'LL
JUST SAY, ANTHONY WEINER HAS
CAPTURED THE MANSCAPING VOTE.
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT JUST GROOMING
THAT.
IS A SCORCHED EARTH POLICY HE'S
GOING ON THERE.
THAT IS... THIS AREA DOWN HERE,
THAT IS WHAT SHERMAN DID TO
ATLANTA.
BUT THIS IS NOT WHY I'M TALKING
ABOUT THIS.
I AM TALKING ABOUT THIS AGAIN
BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN I AM THE
STORY.
APPARENTLY CONGRESSMAN WEINER
ALSO ENGAGED IN FACEBOOK SEX
WITH A LAS VEGAS BLACKJACK
DEALER, WHO CLAIMED SHE TOLD
WEINER, "I WAS SO PSYCHED TO SEE
YOU ON "COLBERT."
YOU WERE SO FUNNY, TO WHICH HE
SAYS, "YOU WATCH IT NAKED"?
AND SHE SAYS, "HA HA, OF
COURSE."
OH, OH, OH, MY GOD.
OH, OH.
OH, MY GOD.
OH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OH.
BRRR.
IT TOOK ME A YEAR TO GET THE
SPITZER OFF ME.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IN THE SPACE OF THE LAST TWO
WEEKS I FIND OUT THAT HUGH
HEFNER AND ANTHONY WEINER HAVE
BOTH USED MY SHOW AS AN
APHRODISIAC.
I FEEL LIKE AN OYSTER.
AND THEN SHE SAID, "TO GET US IN
THE MOOD, FIRST WE WATCH "THE
DAILY SHOW" AND "THE COLBERT
REPORT," OR IF THIS IS NOT YOUR
THING, WE CAN JUST GET DRUNK AND
HAVE MAD, PASSIONATE SEX."
HE SAID, "WHY CHOOSE?
WE MANY BEHIND YOU, CAN'T WE
BOTH WATCH "THE DAILY SHOW"?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
OH, MY STARS.
ANTHONY WEINER IS PROPOSING HE'S
DOING IT DOGGIE DURING "THE
DAILY."
CONGRESSMAN WEINER, YOU BETTER
NOT TRY ANY OF THAT PREVERSION
WITH MY SHOW.
THIS IS FAMILY PROGRAM AND MUST
ONLY BE VIEWED FROM THE
MISSIONARY PO
