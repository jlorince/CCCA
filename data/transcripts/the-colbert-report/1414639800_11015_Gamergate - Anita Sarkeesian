SO I SPEAK FOR ALL GAMERS WHEN ISAY THE
MEDIA SHOULD STOP TALKING TOCRITICS LIKE ANITA SARKEESIAN.
HERE NOW TO BE TALKED TO ISMEDIA CRITIC AND CREATOR
OF THE WEB SERIES FEMINISTFREQUENCY, ANITA SARKEESIAN
[APPLAUSE]ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
LET'S PUT THIS ON THE LINE,OKAY.
LET'S CALL THIS WHAT IT IS.
YOU AND THE OTHER FEMI-NAZISIN THE GAMER WORLD ARE COMING
FOR A BALLS TO CUT EM OFF ANDPUT THEM INTO A LITTLE FELT
PURSE AND TAKE THEM AWAY SO WE
HAVE TO PLAY YOUR NON-VIOLENTGAMES, RIGHT.
>> NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> IT'S A CULTURE WAR. IT'S ASUBCULTURE WAR.
>> THERE IS SOMETHING GOINGON, AND WHAT IT IS IS WOMEN
BEING HARASSED AND THREATENEDAND TERRORIZED.
>> AFTER YOU FIRST ATTACKEDGAMERS AFTER ENJOYING LOOKING
AT BIG BREASTED WOMEN WITH TINYARMOR THAT BARELY COVERS THEIR
NIPPLES. WHAT'S WRONG WITHTHAT? I LIKE WHAT THAT
LOOKS LIKE. I'M A MAN BABY, NEWSFLASH, I LIKE IT.
>> ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THATIS IT ACTUALLY REINFORCES THE
CULTURE MYTH THAT WOMEN ARESEXUAL OBJECTS AND SEXUAL PLAY
THINGS FOR MALE AMUSEMENT ANDWE'RE NOT.
>> Stephen:  WE'RE SAVINGTHEM. THEY'RE DAMSELS INDISTRESS.
I'M SAVING THE PRINCESS.
AM I SUPPOSED TO LET THEPRINCESS DIE? IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT.
THAT'S KINDA HARSH, THAT'S KINDAHOSTILE.
>> MAYBE THE PRINCESS COULDN'TBE A DAMSEL AND SHE COULD SAVE
HERSELF.
[CROWD CHEERING]>> Stephen:  THEY'VE GOT GAMES.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU BROUGHT APOSSE.
>> I'M WELL LIKED.
>> Stephen:  SO YOU'VE BEEN THEOBJECT OF CRITICISM YOURSELF.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  WHAT HAPPENED ATUTAH STATE UNIVERSITY.
>> THERE WAS A THREAT THATSOMEONE E-MAILED TO THE SCHOOL
SAYING THAT THEY WOULD COMMITTHE BIGGEST SCHOOL SHOOTING, A
MASSACRE IF I WAS ALLOWED TOSPEAK.
>> Stephen:  BY CRITICIZINGTHESE, YOU SAY WOULD YOU CALL
THEM MALE FANTASY GAMES OR MALEFANTASY OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN
GAMES.
>> SOME OF THEM.
>> Stephen:  GIVE ME SOMENAMES.
NAME SOME NAMES.
>> SO IN THE WORK THAT I DO, ILOOK AT HUNDREDS OF EXAMPLES OF
VIDEO GAMES.
>> Stephen:  CAN YOU THINK OF 3?>> I CAN BUT IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE
TO TALK ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AS AWHOLE AND HOW IT PERPETUATES
THESE IDEAS OF SEXISM ANDMISOGYNY AS OPPOSED TO GRAND
THEFT AUTO FOR EXAMPLE.
>> Stephen:  WHY DO YOU THINKTHAT WOMEN ARE BEING THREATENED.
IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY WOMEN WHOARE BEING THREATENED IN GAMER
GATES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  CHRIS KLUWE HASTALKED ABOUT THIS, OTHER MEN
HAVEN'T BEEN THREATENED.
WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN ARE BEINGTHREATENED IN THIS EXCHANGE.
>> I THINK WOMEN ARE PERCEIVEDAS THREATENING BECAUSE WE'RE
ASKING FOR GAMES TO BE MOREINCLUSIVE.
WE'RE ASKING FOR GAMES TOACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE EXIST AND WE
LOVE GAMES.
>> Stephen:  WHY NOT HAVE ASEPARATE GAME.
HAVE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL GAMES.
[LAUGHTER]>> WELL WE DO HAVE LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF GAMES.
>> Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOUCOMPLAINING ABOUT.
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGSTHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS WE HAVE
THIS WIDE RANGE OF GAME THATWE'RE SEEING MOBILE GAMES, WE'RE
SEEING INDY GAMES, WE'RE SEEINGTHIS INFLUX OF DIFFERENT KIND OF
GAMES AND THAT'S WHAT GAMERGATEIS RESPONDING TO.
THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESPONDING TOTHE FACT THAT YOU'RE SAYING
GAMING CAN NO LONGER BE THISLITTLE BOY'S CLUB ANYMORE.
MANY OF US WOMEN HAVE BEENPLAYING GAMES OUR WHOLE LIVES.
SO THEY'RE LASHING OUT BECAUSEWE'RE CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO
OF GAMING AS A MALE DOMINATEDSPACE.
[APPLAUSE]>> Stephen:  YOU SEE.
YOU HEAR THE APPLAUSE FOR THEIDEA OF A MALE DOMINATED SPACE.
WHAT ABOUT THE ACCUSATIONS OFCOLLUSION BETWEEN DESIGNERS,
FEMINISTS AND JOURNALISTS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANTIT IS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ETHICS INGAMER JOURNALISM.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HUGE THATIS.
WHAT IF THERE WAS NO ETHICS INHOLLYWOOD JOURNALISM.
[LAUGHTER]IF WE CAN'T TRUST ENTERTAINMENT
TONIGHT OR TMZ, WHERE WOULD WEBE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT FOR GAMERJOURNALISM.
>> I THINK THAT IS A SORT OFCOMPELLING WAY TO REFRAME THE
FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY ANATTACK ON WOMEN.
ETHICS AND JOURNALISM IS NOTWHAT'S HAPPENING IN ANY WAY.
IT'S ACTUALLY MEN GOING AFTERWOMEN IN REALLY HOSTILE
AGGRESSIVE WAYS.
THAT'S WHAT GAMERGATE IS ABOUT.IT'S ABOUT TERRORIZING
WOMEN FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THISINDUSTRY, THIS HOBBY.
>> Stephen:  OFF SUBJECT, BUT ASA MAN, AM I ALLOWED TO BE AFEMINIST.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WOMENSHOULD HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS TO
MEN AND WE SHOULD FIGHT FORTHOSE RIGHTS.
>> Stephen:  SURE.
>> GREAT, THEN YOU'RE AFEMINIST.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen:  ANITA SARKEESIAN,
FEMINIST FREQUENCY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
