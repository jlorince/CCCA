EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I AM PRETTY SURE THAT
THERE IS A NOBEL PRIZE IN MY
FUTURE BECAUSE I HAVE DISCOVERED
AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF
RENEWABLE ENERGY.
MY RAGE AT B.P.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS SATURDAY, FOLKS, B.P.
C.E.O. TONY HAYWARD TOOK TIME
OUT FROM HIS BUSY SCHEDULE OF
MAKING TURTLES EXTINCT TO ATTEND
A YACHT RACE IN ENGLAND.
[AUDIENCE BOOS]
NO WONDER HE WANTED HIS LIFE
BACK BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY
SWEET.
SO EVERYBODY HATES TONY, WHICH
IS BAD NEWS FOR TEXAS
CONGRESSMAN JOE BARTON, BECAUSE
LAST THURSDAY HE SAID THIS TO
HAYWARD.
>> I THINK IT IS A TRAGEDY OF
THE FIRST PROPORTION THAT A
PRIVATE CORPORATION CAN BE
SUBJECTED TO WHAT I WOULD
CHARACTERIZE AS A SHAKEDOWN, IN
THIS CASE A $20 BILLION
SHAKEDOWN.
I APOLOGIZE.
[AUDIENCE BOOS]
>> Stephen: THEN TO SECURE HIS
POPULARITY, BARTON PUNCHED AN
ORPHAN WITH A BOXING GLOVE MADE
OF KITTENS.
NOW, WHAT BARTON SAID SHOCKED
THE NATION.
EVEN REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN
BOEHNER BACKED AWAY SO FAST,
YOU'D THINK BARTON HAD SAID IT
IN SPANISH.
[LAUGHTER]
SO BARTON THEN APOLOGIZE FOR HIS
APOLOGY.
>> I WANT THE RECORD TO BE
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT I THINK
B.P. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ACCIDENT.
IF ANYTHING I SAID THIS MORNING
HAS BEEN MISCONSTRUED TO THE
OPPOSITE EFFECT, I WANT TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT MISCONSTRUED
MISCONSTRUCTION.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: COINCIDENTALLY,
MISCONSTRUED MISCONSTRUCTION IS
ALSO THE NAME OF THE COMPANY
THAT B.P. HIRED TO BUILD THE
WELL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT... I PERSONALLY, FOLKS, I'M
NOT SURE BARTON SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR HIS APOLOGY.
A LOT OF PUNDITS ARE ON THE
FENCE WITH ME.
>> I THINK THAT JOE BARTON,
BEFORE HE APOLOGIZED, HAD A
LEGITIMATE POINT.
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET
CALLED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND
YOU GET SHAKED DOWN.
>> IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A
MISREADING OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND A MISUNDERSTANDING OF
JURISDICTIONAL LIMITS FROM THIS
WHITE HOUSE ON WHAT THE EXTENT
OF EXECUTIVE POWER IS.
>> I'M NOT SURE IF THE PELICANS
WERE IMPORTANT IN THE
CONSTITUTION, FRANKLIN.
I DON'T THINK IT IS.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, BEN STEIN.
THERE IS ONLY ONE CONSTITUTION.
THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE
PELICANS LEFT.
IT IS CLEARLY A SHAKEDOWN,
FOLKS.
NO OIL COMPANY WOULD EVER
VOLUNTARILY DO THE RIGHT THING.
THIS $20 BILLION ESCROW ACCOUNT
IS A VIOLATION OF CASHTUTITIONAL
RIGHTS.
>> YOU ALSO HAVE THE ASPECT OF
THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY MORE OR
LESS ORDERING THIS COMPANY TO
SET ASIDE $20 MILLION WITHOUT
DUE PROCESS.
>> YOU CAN'T STRIP THE COMPANY
OF ASSETS ON THE NOD OF THE
PRESIDENT.
>> THERE'S NO DUE PROCESS.
>> Stephen: NO DUE PROCESS.
THAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE
CONSTITUTION.
YOU CAN'T JUST SEIZE $20 BILLION
AND LOCK IT AWAY WITHOUT A
TRIAL.
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A PERSON.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, LUCKILY, LUCKILY TONY
HAYWARD IS.
SO, OBAMA, DO THE RIGHT THING,
LET THAT MONEY GO, AND LOCK UP
JEEVES HERE.
[APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW WHERE
YOU COULD PUT HIM?
GUANTANAMO BAY.
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T CLOSED IT
YET, AND NO ONE'S ASKING YOU
