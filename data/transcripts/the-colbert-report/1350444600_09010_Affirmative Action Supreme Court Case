THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, FOLKS IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR
AGAIN WHEN SKELETAL FIGURES
SHROUDED IN BLACK FILL YOUR MIND
WITH FEEMPLE THE SUPREME COURT
IS IN SESSION.
-- WITH FEAR BECAUSE THE SUPREME
COURT IS IN SESSION.
THE BIG CASE IS FISHER V
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS.
>> A DECADE AGO THE COURT RULED
THAT RACE COULD BE USED AS A
FACTOR GRANTING COLLEGE
ADMISSION.
TODAY A NEW SUPREME COURT HEARD
A CHALLENGE TO THAT WHICH COULD
CHANGE THE LAW OF THE LAND ON
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
>> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WILL
RETURN TO THE SUPREME COURT
DOCKET.
IT INVOLVES A WHITE STUDENT
FEMALE WHO CLAIMS AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION WAS THE REASON SHE WAS
SHUT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
TEXAS.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME TO IN TEN
YEARS THE JUSTICES ARE WEIGHING
THE QUESTION:  HAS AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION RUN ITS COURSE?
>> YES, BECAUSE DISCRIMINATION
IS OVER.
JUST LOOK AT CNN.
THEY EMPLOY ON ALL TALENT FROM
ALL ETHNICITIES AND BACKGROUNDS
AND THAT'S JUST SOLEDAD O'BRIEN.
THE STUDENT DENIED ADMISSION TO
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS CLAIMS
HER RACE WAS HELD AGAINST HER
FORCING HER TOLL ATTEND
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY.
FOLKS, THERE'S NO GREATER
INJUSTICE THAN HAVING TO ATTEND
YOUR SAFETY SCHOOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN I HAD TO
GO TO DARTMOUTH INSTEAD OF MY
FIRST CHOICE HOGWARTS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I MEAN THEY NEVER --
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY NEVER EVEN RESPONDED TO MY
APPLICATION OWL PROBABLY BECAUSE
HE WAS WHITE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT NATION --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT NATION, IT LOOKS LIKE
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION'S DAYS ARE
NUMBERED BECAUSE CHIEF JUSTICE
ROBERT HAS A HISTORY OF OPPOSING
THESE TERRIBLE QUOTAS HE SAID
THE WAY TO STOP DISCRIMINATION
ON THE BASIS OF RACE IS TO STOP
DISCRIMINATING ON THE BASIS OF
RACE.
YEAH, EVERYBODY JUST KNOCK IT
OFF.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T NEED A
LAW TO STOP THEM FROM
DISCRIMINATING.
GIVE THEM A CHANCE AND THEY'LL
DO IT ON THEIR OWN.
THAT'S WHY LINCOLN ISSUED THE
EMANCIPATION SUGGESTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOPEFULLY, FOLKS --
HOPEFULLIES -- WE'LL GET A
SUPREME COURT RULING THAT LEADS
TO A MORE EQUAL WORLD AIM POST
RACIAL MET YOUR OK CASEY WHERE
NO ONE IS GIVEN AN ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE OF SKIN COLOR WHERE IN
THE INSTITUTIONS ONLY THE CREAM
OF CROP IS
