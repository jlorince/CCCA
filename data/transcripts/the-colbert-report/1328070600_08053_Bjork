( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW ALBUM
THAT IS BEING RELEASED AS A
SERIES OF APPS.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HER NEW
BOOK BEING RELEASED ON AN
ELECTRIC RAZOR.
PLEASE WELCOME BJORK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY!
LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NOW, NOW, WE ACTUALLY ARE
RECORDING THIS INTERVIEW AFTER
YOU SANG THE SONG.
BUT WHEN WE BROADCAST THIS
INTERVIEW WILL BE BEFORE THE
SONG.
SO ARE YOU WILLING TO KEEP UP
THE FACADE FOR THE AUDIENCE AT
HOME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING
FIRST?
( LAUGHTER )
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen:  YOU GOOD WITH
THAT.
>> TAME TRAVEL.
>> Stephen:  WE'RE DOING A
LITTLE TIME SHUFFLING.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen:  WHY ART?
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ARTIST,
RIGHT?
YOU EXPLORE ART IN ALL OF ITS
FORMS, NOT JUST MUSIC, CORRECT?
>> WELL, I'M MOSTLY ABOUT MUSIC.
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT MUSIC.
>> Stephen:  RIGHT, BUT THIS
ALBUM IN PARTICULAR ISN'T JUST
MUSIC.
IT'S GOT THIS GRAPHIC INTERFACE
HERE.
LET ME SHOW.
THE ALBUM IS CALLED PHIOTHELLIA
AND IT HAS APPS THAT GO WITH IT.
IT'S A GREAT ALBUM.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE APPS ARE
KIND OF DANGEROUS BECAUSE I WAS
TRYING TO WATCH YOUR ALBUM WHILE
DRIVING TO WORK TODAY AND NEARLY
KILLED MYSELF.
LIKE LOOK AT THIS.
ARE WE TURNED UP HERE.
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS.
AN APP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO-- I
GOAT TO JOIN THE SONG.
( APPLAUSE )
LOOK AT THAT.
AND THEN IF YOU GO THROUGH THE
PHASES OF THE MOON, IT CHANGES
WHAT THE SONG IS LIKE.
>> YUP.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS
EXTRAORDINARY.
OKAY.
THAT BEING SAID--
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S-- IT'S STILL PLAYING.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S IN CONTROL.
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS-- THIS IS A DEBACLE.
GOING NOWHERE.
BUT-- WHAT-- WHY IS-- WHY THE
APPS TO GO WITH THE SONGS?
I WANTED TO WRITE THE ALBUM ON A
TOUCH SCREEN, AND I STARTED OUT
IN 2008.
AND THAT WAS, LIKE, TWO YEARS
BEFORE THEiPAD CAME OUT, SO I
COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT WOULD
HAPPEN, RIGHT?
SO WHILE I WAS WRITING ON THE
TOUCH SCREEN, I GOT REALLY
EXCITED BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST
TIME I COULD SORT OF-- BECAUSE I
CAN'T REALLY PLAY THE GUITAR AND
SING AT THE SAME TIME.
AND I CAN'T REALLY PLAY THE
PIANO AND SING AT THE SAME TIME.
SO I WAS, LIKE, FINALLY I CAN BE
A TROUBADOUR.
>> Stephen:  DID YOU ACTUALLY
CREATE THE ALBUM IN THAT WAY?
YOU DREAMED OF CRETING THE
AMBULL THAT WAY WITH A TOUCH
SCREEN?
>> I DID.
I JUST THINK WHEN YOU DO TOUCH
SCREEN IT'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S A DIFFERENT SENSATION TO
WRITE MUSIC WITH A MOUSE.
LIKE, HOW DID YOU DO YOUR DOUBLE
ALBUM.
LIKE THIS.
>> Stephen:  NOW YOU CAN DO IT
LIKE THIS.
( LAUGHTER )
OR LIKE THAT.
( LAUGHTER )
CAN I LICK YOUR ALBUM?
CAN I LICK THE APPS?
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT-- A
SCRATCH AND SNIFF ALBUM.
>> THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
>> Stephen:  THE THING THAT
WORRIES ME IS YOU'RE MIXING
SCIENCE LIKE PHYSICS.
YOU'RE SINGING ABOUT PHYSICS AND
TALKING ABOUT PHYSICS AND USING
THIS TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT SCIENCE
AND MUSIC AT THE SAME TIME.
WHY SULLY MUSIC WITH SOMETHING
AGES UGLY AS SCIENCE?
CAN'T TRUST SCIENCE.
>> I WAS QUITE EXCITED ABOUT
SCIENCE.
WHEN I WAS A KID I LOVED MATH IN
SCHOOL.
>> 2 PLUS 2 EQUALS 4.
>> SUDDENLY I HAD THE TOUCH
SCREEN IN MY LAP, AND I WAS
LIKE, WOW.
NOW I CAN START TO MAP OUT HOW I
FEEL SONGS SHOULD BE IN A MORE
INTUITIVE WAY, AND THAT SENT ME
BACK TO WHEN I WAS IN MUSIC
SCHOOL IN ICELAND --
>> Stephen:  CAN I ASK YOU A
QUESTION ABOUT ICELAND?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN ELFS THERE?
I READ YOU PEOPLE BELIEVE IN
ELFS IN ICELAND?
IS THAT TRUE?
>> WE DO.
BUT YOU GUYS BELIEVE IN GHOST,
RIGHT?
>> Stephen:  OH, YEAH, GHOSTS
ARE REAL.
WE HAVE, LIKE, GHOST HUNTERS ON
TV.
YOU CAN ONLY SEE THEM WITH ONE
OF THOSE GREEN LIGHT CAMERAS,
THOUGH.
YOU HAVE REAL ELVES, IN THE
VOLCANIC AREAS, YOU GO UP THERE
AND THERE ARE POWERFUL
ORDER-WORLDLY BEE, RIGHT?
>> IT'S SORT OF A RELATIONSHIP
WITH NATURE, LIKE WITH THE ROCKS
THEY ALL LIVE IN THE ROCKS, SO
YOU HAVE TO-- IT'S ALL ABOUT
RESPECT, YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen:  YOU GOTTA RESPECT
THE ELVES?
>> YEAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELL, BJORK, WILL
YOU STICK AND AROUND DO A SONG
FOR US LATER?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S WONDERFUL.
BJORK, THANK YOU, PLEASURE TO
MEET YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY
BJORK.
