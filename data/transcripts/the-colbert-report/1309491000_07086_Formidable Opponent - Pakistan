>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYONE.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, SPEAKING OF PACS,
RECENTLY PAKISTAN'S
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
ARRESTED THE MEMBERS OF
THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION WHO
HAD HELPED US FIND OSAMA BIN
LADEN.
THIS IS RENEWED CALLS TO CUT
OFF THE BILLIONS IN AID WE
GIVE TO PAKISTAN EVERY YEAR.
NOW OTHERS SAY THAT MONEY
KEEPS PAKISTAN A STABLE AND
IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE WAR ON
TERROR.
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
WELL, AN ISSUE THIS COMPLEX
CAN ONLY BE TACKLED WITH
SOMEONE WITH A KEEN MIND AND
VAST INTERNATIONAL
EXPERIENCE.
ME, STEPHEN COLBERT.
THIS IS FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.
STEPHEN, THANKS FOR COMING.
ANYTHING FOR YOU, BUDDY.
>> AFTER ALL, WE ARE
PARTNERS IN THE WAR ON
TERROR.
>> Stephen: YES, WE ARE.
>> Stephen: I SAID PARTNERS
IN THE WAR ON TERROR.
>> Stephen: OH, SORRY, I
WASN'T LISTENING, I'M SORRY.
THERE YOU GO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY, IT'S ALL
THERE.
AND OH, YEAH, ONE ROCKET
LAUNCHER.
YOU DIDN'T GET THIS FROM ME.
>> Stephen: DIDN'T GET WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: STEPHEN, HOW CAN
WE KEEP PAYING PAKISTAN?
THEY ARRESTED EVERYTHING WHO
HELPED US.
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT NOW
THAT THEY WERE HARBORING
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> ALLEGEDLY HE WAS IN A
MANSION NEXT TO THEIR
MILITARY ACADEMY.
IF THEY WEREN'T COMPLICITY,
THEY WERE INCOMPETENT.
>> Stephen: NOT NECESSARILY.
THEY COULD BE INCOME
PET-ELICIT.
WHERE YOU ARE HELPING THE
ENEMIES BUT ARE REALLY BAD
AT IT.
ALL THE SUPPLY LINES TO
AFGHANISTAN RUN THROUGH
PAKISTAN.
>> Stephen: WHO CARES, THAT
WAR IS UNWINNABLE.
>> Stephen: YES, BUT WITHOUT
THEIR HELP, WE CAN'T KEEP
FIGHTING IT.
>> Stephen: THE POINT IS,
THEY ARE A NUCLEAR POWER
THEREFORE WE NEED THEIR
FRIENDSHIP.
>> Stephen: FRIENDSHIP, THEY
FUNDED THE MUMBAI ATTACKS
MUCH.
THE TIMES SQUARE BOMBING WAS
PLANNED IN PAKISTAN.
AND THEY SOLD NUCLEAR
TECHNOLOGY TO IRAN AND NORTH
KOREA IN THE '90s.
>> Stephen: OH, THE '90s.
LET'S STAY ANGRY ABOUT
FURBIES AN PARACHUTE PANTS.
LOOK, WE NEED TO GIVE THEM
AN ULTIMATUM.
STOP SUPPORTING TERROR OR NO
MORE AID.
>> Stephen: EASY NOW, BUDDY.
THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP, JUST
LIKE YOU AND ME.
WE'RE PARTNERS.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU
GET TO DECIDE WHO MY OTHER
FRIENDS ARE.
>> Stephen: I JUST THINK
JILL'S A PITCH.
>> Stephen: WE'RE NOT HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN.
>> Stephen: THE POINT IS,
SOME OF MY OTHER FRIENDS
LIKE TO DO THINGS THAT YOU
DON'T LIKE TO DO.
LIKE SKIING, OR TRYING TO
KILL YOU.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR
FRIENDSHIP.
>> Stephen: WAIT, ONE OF
YOUR FRIENDS WANTS TO KILL
ME?
>> Stephen: NO.
>> Stephen: YAY, ME, STEPHEN
ALBERT.
>> Stephen: WAIT, WHERE DID
HE COME FROM.
>> Stephen: WELL, HE WAS
STANDING NEXT TO ME BUT I
WAS NOT HIDING HIM.
I JUST DIDN'T NOTICE OR WAS
HIDING HIM.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO KILL
YOU FOR YOUR FREEDOM.
>> Stephen: WELL THIS IS
AWKWARD.
>> Stephen: YEAH, I'M NOT
GIVING YOU ANY MORE MONEY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
YOU MIGHT GIVE IT TO HIM.
>> Stephen: YES, GIVE IT TO
ME.
YOU KNOW C-4 EXPLOSIVE, THEY
JUST RELEASED C-5.
>> Stephen: DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T GIVE IT TO HIM AS
LONG AS YOU KEEP GIVING ME
MONEY.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO
DO THAT.
>> Stephen: WELL, I'VE GOT
TO GET MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE.
YOU WANT TO BUY A ROCKET
LAUNCHER.
>> Stephen: OH, YES, I CAN
PAY YOU IN CASH, DIAMOND OR
DAUGHTERS.
>> Stephen: NO, NO, FINE,
FINE.
HERE.
THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: AND THANK YOU.
OH I HATE YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: YOU JUST GAVE
HIM MY MONEY.
>> Stephen: I HAVE HEARD
THESE DISTURBING RUMORS AND
I WILL CONDUCT A THOROUGH
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION.
WHICH WILL REQUIRE MORE
MONEY.
>> Stephen: GO [BLEEP]
YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SUIT
YOURSELF.
THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NO!
>> Stephen: YES!
>> Stephen: DON'T WORRY I'LL
GET THAT ROCKET LAUNCHER
BACK.
I JUST NEED SOME MORE MONEY.
>> Stephen: WAIT, YOU TAKE
THE INFIDEL'S MONEY.
I KILL YOU TOO!
>> Stephen: SEE, WE HAVE THE
SAME ENEMIES.
AND THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS
MY FRIEND.
>> Stephen: THEN YOU'RE A
TERRIBLE FRIEND.
>> Stephen: AND YOU, SIR,
ARE A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.
