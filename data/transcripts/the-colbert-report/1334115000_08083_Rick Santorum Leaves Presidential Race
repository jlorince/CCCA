[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN HERE, OUT THERE AND OBVIOUSLY ALL MY VIEWERS FROM RAVENCLAW
AND HUFFLEPUFF.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, SOME DAYS I HAVE TO DO THIS SHOW NO MATTER HOW SAD I AM.
TONIGHT IS ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS.
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.
I'M A MESS.
MY PART IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
MY KNOT DIMPLE IS OFF CENTER.
I MIGHT AS WELL BE IN SWEATPANTS.
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THIS.
>> THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE FOR US IS OVER, FOR ME, AND WE WILL SUSPEND OUR CAMPAIGN EFFECTIVE TODAY.
>> Stephen: NOOOOOOOO!
RICK, RICK, I LOVED YOU, BUT NOT IN MAN-ON-DOG WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, MANY ARE SPECULATING THAT SANTORUM DROPPED OUT NOW TO AVOID THE EMBARRASSMENT OF
LOSING TO ROMNEY IN PENNSYLVANIA, HIS HOME STATE,
THOUGH GIVEN THE NUMBER OF HOUSES MITT ROMNEY OWN,
PENNSYLVANIA IS PROBABLY HIS HOME STATE, TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, THAT'S IT.
SANTORUM IS OUT, AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON HOW VERY SOON WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HIM VERY
LITTLE LATER IN THE SHOW.
[LAUGHTER]
OH, WE WON'T?
THAT WAS FAST.
