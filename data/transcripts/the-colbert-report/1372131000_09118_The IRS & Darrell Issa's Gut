NO!
OKAY.
STORY CHECKS OUT.
FOLKS, MY JOB IS NOT EASY, AS
YOU CAN SEE.
BUT LATELY MY JOB HAS BEEN KIND
OF FUN.
YOU SEE, BARACK OBAMA IS
ENGULFED IN SO MANY SCANDALS,
YOU ALMOST FORGET HE'S BLACK.
FOR MY MONEY, HIS MOST SERIOUS
SCANDAL IS THE I.R.S.'S
TARGETING OF THE TEA PARTY.
WELL, LAST WEEK THOSE TEA PARTY
PATRIOTS ROARED BACK.
>> TEA PARTY PROTESTERS STORMING
CAPITOL HILL.
RAILING AGAINST THE I.R.S. AND
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
>> THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS
GATHERED OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL TO
STAND UP AGAINST TARGETING FROM
THE I.R.S. AND TO PUSH BACK
AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT.
>> NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE
POLITICIANS TO LISTEN TO ALL OF
YOU.
YOU'RE HERE.
AND YOU'RE CLEAR.
WITH YOUR MESSAGE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE CLEAR.
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE QUEER,
HIGH MUSS BAND RUNS A CAMP THAT
CAN CURE YOU WITH JESUS.
LUCKILY, FOLKS, ONE MAN IS
GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
SCANDAL: CALIFORNIA
REPRESENTATIVE AND MAFIA TRIBUTE
FACE DARRELL ISSA WHO
INTERROGATED TOP OFFICIALS FROM
THE I.R.S.'S CINCINATTI OFFICE
IN CLOSED-DOOR HEARINGS AS HE
EXPLAINED ON CNN'S STATE OF THE
CROWLEY.
>> WHAT WE HAVE ARE PEOPLE WHO
COME IN TO TRANSCRIBE INTERVIEWS
AND THEY'RE SAYING UNDER PENALTY
OF CRIMES THAT CERTAIN THINGS
ARE TRUE
>> Stephen: DID YOU HEAR THAT?
CERTAIN THINGS ARE TRUE.
REMEMBER, THAT'S UNDER PENALTY
OF CRIMES WHICH MEANS I BELIEVE
IF THEY'RE LYING THEY HAVE TO
COME COMMIT A CRIME.
AND THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
AND ISSA PRESENTED THE HARD
EVIDENCE OF WHAT HE FOUND.
>> THE ADMINISTRATION IS STILL
TRYING TO SAY THERE WAS A FEW
ROGUE AGENTS IN CINCINATTI WHEN
IN FACT THE INDICATION IS THEY
DIRECTLY BEING ORDERED FROM
WASHINGTON.
MY GUT TELLS ME THAT TOO MANY
PEOPLE KNEW THAT THIS WRONGDOING
WAS GOING ON.
>> Stephen: YEAH, MY GUT TELLS
ME THE SAME THING.
I MEAN THIS CAN'T JUST BE
CINCINATTI.
REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING: WHAT
HAPPENS IN CINCINATTI, NOTHING
HAPPENS IN CINCINATTI.
AND THAT'S WHAT ISSA SAID.
BUT HE REFUSED TO RELEASE THE
FULL TRANSCRIPTS FOR A VERY GOOD
REASON WHICH HE ALSO REFUSED TO
RELEASE.
BUT ON ON TUESDAY, CONGRESSMAN
ELIJAH CUMMINGS RELEASED THE
FULL TRANSCRIPT TO THE PRESS.
AND IT PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT
ISSA WAS RIGHT.
TO NOT WANT THE TRANSCRIPT
RELEASED.
JIM?
>> A CINCINATTI-BASED I.R.S.
MANAGER WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS
A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN TOLD
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE WAS INVOLVED IN
TARGETING CONSERVATIVE GROUPS.
