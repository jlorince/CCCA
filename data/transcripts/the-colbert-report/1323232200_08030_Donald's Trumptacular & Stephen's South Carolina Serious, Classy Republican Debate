YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POINT!
NATION, I AM SICK AND TIRED OF
MEDIA ELITES CRITICIZING THE
G.O.P. PRESIDENTIAL FIELD SAYING
THAT THEY MADE MILLIONS AS
UNREGISTERED LOBBYISTS OR THEY
KILL COYOTES WHEN JOGGING OR
THEY SAID "THE LION KING" WILL
TURN YOUR KIDS GAY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND ON ABC'S THIS WEEK THIS WEEK
JOURNALISTIC ELDER STATESMAN
WITH A FOUR-YEAR-OLD HAIR CUT
GEORGE WILL HAD THE BALLS TO
TRIP WHOLE FIELD.
>> BETWEEN NOW AND 2016 THOSE
PARTIES HAVE TO DO SOME SERIOUS
THOUGHTS AS TO WHETHER THEY CAN
DEVELOP SOME FITER TO PREVENT
THIS PROCESS-- PARTICULARLY WITH
MAD PROLIFERATION OF DEBATES--
FROM BEING HIJACKED BY
CHARLATANS, ENTREPRENEURS AND
ENTREPRENEUR FLURL CHARLATANS.
>> Stephen: AND DON'T GET HIM
STARTED ON THE CHARLA-PRENEURIAL
ENTREPRE-NARLATANSS!
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THE MEDIA SNOB CANS SHUT
THEIR TRAPS BECAUSE THE NEXT
REPUBLICAN DEBATE IS GOING TO BE
SUPER SERIOUS.
>> THERE IS A DEBATE THAT WILL
HAPPEN ACTUALLY ON THE 27th OF
DECEMBER HOSTED BY NONE OTHER
THAN DONALD TRUMP WHO WILL BE
THE MODERATOR.
>> Stephen: BOOM!
SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR YOU NOW?
DOES JIM LEHRER HAVE HIS OWN
BRAND OF BOTTLED WATER?
DOES JIM LEHRER POOP IN A GOLDEN
TOY SFLET NO.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM LEHRER IS NOT SERIOUS AND
TRUMP IS READY TO MAKE THIS
DEBATE ABOUT IDEAS.
>> I LIKE THE IDEA OF BRINGING
IN SOME VERY GOOD TALENT AND
PEOPLE THAT ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN
CERTAIN SUBJECTS.
I'M PRETTY KNOWLEDGEABLE ON MOST
OF THE SUBJECT.
I'M ACTUALLY VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE
ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THINGS OF
THAT LIKE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SO, CANDIDATES, BE
PREPARED TO BE DRILLED ON
"THINGS OF THAT LIKE."
"ITEMS OF THAT SUCH."
"TOPICS OF THIS STUFF" AND
"FLUENCY IN, YOU KNOW, THAT ONE
THING."
(LAUGHTER)
AFTER THE DEBATE, TRUMP IS GOING
TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS
DEBATE THE FIRST ONE THAT REALLY
COUNTS.
>> THE DEBATE IS DECEMBER 27.
I'M LOOKING TO ENDORSE SOMEBODY
AFTER THAT DEBATE.
>> Stephen: TRUMP WILL ENDORSE
THE WINNER.
SECOND PLACE WINS GARY BUSEY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, CLEARLY, CLEARLY TRUMP
WANTS TO BE THE NEW REPUBLICAN
KING MAKER EVEN BEFORE THIS
DEBATE ANNOUNCEMENT HE HAND
CANDIDATES LINING UP TO KISS HIS
GOLD RING!
WHICH IS NOT EASY TO FIND
BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME COLOR AS
HIS SKIN.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THIS TRUMP TACK ALREADY A
IS STILL NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR
PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE W. BUSH'S FOR
ARI FLEISHER WHO CALLED IT AN
INVITATION TO A CIRCUS.
KARL ROVE WHO SAID "I THINK THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CHAIRMAN
OUGHT TO STEP IN AND SAY "WE
STRONGLY DISCOURAGE EVERY
CANDIDATE FROM APPEARING."
BUSH STRATEGIST MARK McKINNON
WHO SAID "THIS TRUMP DEBATE IS
PROOF THE INMATES HAVE TAKEN
OVER THE ASYLUM."
(LAUGHTER)
AND TODAY POSSIBLY INEVITABLE
NOMINEE AND SECOND-PLACE
FRONT-RUNNER MITT ROMNEY
DELINE'S TRUMP'S INVITATION
WHICH MEANS THERE IS A GOOD
CHANCE TOMORROW HE WILL ACCEPT
TRUMP'S INVITATION.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD MAN.
FOLKS, I THINK THESE CANDIDATES
ARE MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TURNING
UP FOR TRUMP.
BUT I GET WHY THEY'RE HESITANT.
THE GUY'S A CLOWN ONLY WITH MORE
MAKEUP.
I CAN THEY BECAUSE DONALD'S A
FRIEND, A TREMENDOUS GUY.
HE'S GREAT.
WE HAVE THE WORLD'S NUMBER
ONE-RATED FRIENDSHIP.
HAVING SAID THAT, HE'S A JOKE.
(LAUGHTER)
A BIG CUCKOO LUNATIC.
I WOULDN'T TRUST HIM WITH A
BURNT MATCH.
THIS GUY IS NOT A KING MAKER,
HE'S SMALL POTATOES.
FINGERLINGS, TREMENDOUS.
BEST SIDE DISH EVER.
DO THE MATH, I PERSONALLY
BROADCAST 161 SHOWS A YEAR, HE
DOES 20.
A MIDDLE SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF
"THE MUSIC MAN" DOES MORE THAN
THAT, OKAY?
HE'S A CHILD.
HE'S A TODDLER WEARING MAN
PANTS.
LOOK AT THIS YUCK.
LOOKS LIKE A GIN-SOAKED RAISIN
FELL INTO A NUCLEAR REACTOR.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT?
NUCLEAR.
NUCLEAR POWER, BY THE WAY, THE
FUTURE I'M HEAVILY INVESTED.
YOU WANT TO PLAY KING MAKER,
DONALD?
THAT'S MY TURF.
I GET THINGS DONE, I CLOSE DEALS
ASK MY GUESTS.
THE BLACK KEYS WANTED GLUTEN
FREE CRACKERS, I MADE IT HAPPEN.
BOOM, NOBODY ELSE DOES THAT.
I STARTED A SUPERPAC.
UNPRECEDENTED MONEY,
UNPRECEDENTED INFLUENCE.
I CAN CALL THE POPE, HE ANSWERS,
WE TALK SOCCER.
SEE THIS WATCH?
100% PLATINUM.
SEE THIS WATCH?
100% GOLD.
OKAY?
I WEAR THEM UNDERWATER, FISH
LOVE THEM, THEY'RE SHINY.
EVERY NIGHT I EAT EGG ROLLS FOR
DINNER.
NOBODY STOPS ME.
EVERY BATHROOM IN MY HOUSE HAS
TWO SYNCS AND THREE TOILETS.
I USE ALL OF THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS FORGET DONALD
TRUMP, HE'S HISTORY ROLLED IN
FORGET HIM SMOTHERED IN A
YESTERDAY SAUCE.
(LAUGHTER)
TOMORROW IS ABOUT ME, THE MOST
FAMOUS MAN IN THE HISTORY OF
SOUTH CAROLINA.
THE G.O.P.... THE G.O.P. WANTS A
SERIOUS DEBATE?
THEY DESERVE IT.
BAR NONE, THEY'RE THE BEST PARTY
IN THE WORLD, THAT INCLUDES
SPACE!

PHONE NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES PHONE SYSTEM.

AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BRAINIACS.
IT'S GOING TO BE REAL ISSUES

GALLON OF MILK IN AN HOUR.
