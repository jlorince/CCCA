>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PLEASE, FOLKS.
I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF
EVIL AND THEN WENT IN FOR A
KISS.
I WAS GETTING MIXED SIGNALS.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
[SIREN BLARES]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, I LOVE THE GUINNESS BOOK
OF WORLD RECORDS.
IT IS BY FAR THE BEST
ALCOHOL-SPONSORED REFERENCE
BOOK.
SORRY, CAPTAIN MORGAN'S RHYMING
DICTIONARY, IT'S 1,000 PAGES OF
WORDS THAT RHYME WITH ARRRGH,
LIKE STARARRRGH AND CARARRRGH
AND TENNESSEE SENATOR
LAMARARRRGH ALEXANDERARRRGH.
>> TWO MEN IN NEW JERSEY HAVE
SET THE RECORD FOR THE LONGEST
CONTINUOUS KISS.
MATT DALEY AND MATT CANCIELLO
KISSED FOR MORE THAN 33 HOURS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
FOLKS, THE WORLD'S LONGEST KISS
IS A GAY KISS.
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT GAY
KISS, THE HOMOSEXUAL KISS IT TRY
-- TRIBUTE BAND.
JIMMY, THAT'S REGULAR KISS.
PUT UP GAY KISS.
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS BRINGS ME, FOLKS, THIS
BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER
THREE, RECORD-BREAKING GAYS.
THESE DAYS ARE DESTROYING THE
TRADITIONAL SANCTITY OF STRAIGHT
WORLD RECORDS.
THE ONLY TIME TWO DUDES SHOULD
HAVE A RECORD TOGETHER IS IF
THEY'RE JOINED AT THE TORSO OR
ARE THE FATTEST TWINS ON
MOTORCYCLES.
NATION, WE MUST, WE MUST KEEP
OUR RECORDS FROM FALLING TO THE
GAYS.
EXCEPT FOR THOSE BROKEN BY
U.S.C. 100-METER DASH RECORD
HOLDER TYSON GAY, WHO IS
STRAIGHT.
HE HAD NO CHOICE ABOUT HIS LAST
NAME.
HE WAS BORN THAT WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NEXT UP, FOLKS...
GOOD-LOOKING GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT, TERRIBLE NEWS FROM THE
ANIMAL KINGDOM.
RESEARCHERS SAY THAT 50 TO 80%
OF THE WORLD'S KOALA POPULATION
IS SUFFERING FROM CHLAMYDIA.
EXPERTS FEAR THAT IF A VACCINE
ISN'T FOUND SOON, THE KOALA MAY
BECOME EXTINCT, WHICH BRINGS US
TO THREAT NUMBER TWO, WHOEVER IS
[BLEEPED] OUR KOALAS, KNOCK IT
OFF!
NOT FUNNY.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS THE MOST...
[APPLAUSE]
THIS IS THE MOST DISTURBING
BEASTALTY NEWS I'VE HEARD
OUTSIDE OF ANY E-MAIL FROM CARL
PALADINO.
WHY, WHY WOULD ANYONE SLEEP WITH
A KOALA?
AFTERWARDS THEY'RE SO CLINGY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHO I BLAME,
FOLKS, THE AUSTRALIANS.
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, IF THIS
IS THEIR BEER CAN, IMAGINE THE
BEER GOGGLES THEY GET.
NO WONDER THEIR DIGERI-DOING
THEIR WILDLIFE.
KOALA, DO THE RIGHT THING AND
ALERT YOUR PREVIOUS PARTNERS.
I HAVE A FEELING JACK HANNAH
WILL GET AN AWKWARD PHONE CALL
TONIGHT.
SPEAKING OF ILLNESS, FOLKS, IT'S
TIME TO GET READY FOR FLU
SEASON.
UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF OUR WEAPONS
IN THE WAR ON GERMS HAS BEEN
NEUTRALIZE.
>> NEW STUDIES TODAY ON KEEPING
OUR HANDS CLEAN AND PREVENTING
ILLNESSES.
USING AN ALCOHOL-BASED HAND
SANITIZER DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCE THE CHANCE OF CATCHING A
COLD OR FLU.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
HAND SANITIZER DOES NOT WORK.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
I USE THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME.
AND NOT JUST ON MY HANDS.
[LAUGHTER]
I GO HEAD TO TOE.
AND ONCE EVERY OCTOBER I GET A
PURELL COLONIC.
IT STINGS LIKE THE DICKENS, BUT
ON THE PLUS SIDE, YOU GET
HAMMERED.
AND YOU CAN STILL PASS A
BREATHALYZER.
BUT LISTEN, LISTEN, FOLKS, JUST
LISTEN TO WHO COMMISSIONED THIS
STUDY.
THE DIAL CORPORATION, WHICH
MAKES HAND SANITIZER, WHICH
BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER ONE,
SCIENTISTS WHO DON'T GIVE THE
RESULTS THEIR CORPORATE
BENEFACTORS WANT.
COME ON, SCIENTISTS!
DON'T BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS
YOU, ESPECIALLY IF THAT HAND HAS
BEEN PURELLED.
IT'S STILL COVERED WITH GERMS.
WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE THE
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM THE
50s WHO RECOMMENDED SMOKING
BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD FOR YOUR
T-ZONE.
IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT WE FOUND
OUT THE T STOOD FOR TRACHEOTOMY.
SO BE INDIVIDUAL -- INDIVIDUAL
LEN, NATION, THE FLU IS OUT THE
GET YOU.
AVOID ANY LARGE PUBLIC
GATHERINGS WHERE GERMS COULD BE.
I'LL HAVE MORE TI
