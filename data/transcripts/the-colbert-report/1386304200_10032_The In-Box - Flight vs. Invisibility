>> Stephen: LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, WELCOME, THANK YOU
FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THE ENERGY IN THIS ROOM, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN, I FEEL LIKE I AM
AN AUCTION AND I AM A PRIZECALF.
THE HAT OF THE MEAT, A LOT OFTHE MAJOR STORIES TO COVER
TONIGHT.
MASSIVE ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTSBREAKING OUT IN UKRAINE, ATTACK
ON THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IN YESMEN, THOUSANDS OF FAST FOOD
WORKERS ON STRIKE ACROSSHUNDREDS OF CITIES IN THE UNITED
STATES, SO WE DIVE RIGHT IN ANDREAD SOME VIEWER MAIL.
>> FOLKS, GOT A BIG FILE RIGHTHERE.
OUR FIRST LETTER TONIGHT COMESTO US ON ACTUAL PAPER.
DEAR STEPHEN, WHICH POWER ISBETTER, FLIGHT OR INVISIBILITY?
I AM ASKING FOR A FRIEND.
SINCERELY, STEPHEN COLBERT, BUTNOT YOU.
THAT'S NICE, STEVEN, I RECOGNIZEMY OWN HANDWRITING.
OKAY, LET'S SETTLE THIS ONE, FORONCE AND ALL, OBVIOUSLY FLIGHT
AND INVISIBILITY HAVE BIG PROSAND CONS.
FLIGHT, PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE I AMSCARED OF HEIGHTS, BUT SO IS
INVISIBILITY, BECAUSE I AMSCARED OF PEOPLE NOT NOTICING
ME.
SO THAT'S A TIE.
ONE POINT EACH.
NOW LET'S TALK THE ECONOMICS OFTHE SITUATION.
THE MOST RECENT SUPERMAN GROSSED$291 MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE
BUT THE "LORD OF THE RINGS"GROSSED 377 MILLION.
CLEARLY, THE MARKET SAYSINVISIBILITY, NOT TO MENTION,
THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKETIS INVISIBLE.
DOUBLE WIN FOR INVISIBILITY, TWOINVISIBLE THUMBS UP.
>> NOW, AS LONG --[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: PEOPLE LOVE THEINVISIBILITY.
AS LONG AS WE ARE TALKING SUPERMAN, FOLKS, WITH FLIGHT, YOU
COULD FLY AROUND THE WORLDBACKWARDS TO REVERSE TIME,
THAT'S A HUGE POWER, BUT WITHINVICTIM, YOU CAN GO TO A DINNER
PARTY AND NOT HAVE TO DRINK TWOGLASSES OF RED WINE BEFORE YOU
FEEL COMFORTABLE.
>> AGAIN, ONE POINT EACH.
>> OF COURSE YOU HAVE GOT TOREMEMBER, ONLY YOUR BODY TURNS
INVISIBLE.
NOT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF IT,THAT'S WHY THE INVISIBLE MAN HAD
TO GET NAKED TO DISAPPEAR.
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ACLUSTER OF FLOATING CAR KEYS,
COINS AND CELLPHONES, THEY ALLHAVE TO GO UP THE BUTT.
NO, NO, HEY.
I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE GOT TO IT.
TO IT'S NATURE'S POCKETS SO YOUMIGHT WANT TO RETHINK THAT
BOTTLE OPENER KEY RING.
FOLKS, I WOULD SAY THAT CLINCHESIT, ALSO, IT CLENCHES IT.
ALL RIGHT.
FLIGHT WINS!  NO MORE ON THESUBJECT.
JIM, LET'S CLOSE THE
