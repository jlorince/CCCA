>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE
SURPRISED WE'RE BACK AT ALL.
IF YOU REMEMBER CHRISTIAN
PREACHER AND CALIFORNIA RAISIN
HAROLD CAMPING PREDICTED THAT
ON MAY 21st, THE WORLD WOULD END
AND ALL HUMAN LIFE WOULD BE
DESTROYED, EXCEPT FOR THE HOLY,
WHO WOULD BE RAPTURED TO HEAVEN.
BUT APPARENTLY, EARTH REFUSED TO
EXPLODE BEFORE IT COULD SEE
"THE HANGOVER: PART 2."
[LAUGHTER]
LIKE MANY OF YOU, I MADE MY
PREPARATIONS -- TURNED OFF THE
OVEN, GAVE UP ON BEARD HYGIENE,
AND BID FAREWELL TO MY
HELL-BOUND NEIGHBORS IN
SPRAY-PAINT ON THEIR GARAGE
DOOR.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH REMINDS ME, I'VE GOT TO
RETURN THAT SPRAY PAINT TO MY
OTHER NEIGHBOR.
OF COURSE, THE PEOPLE WHO
COUNTED ON THE ANGUISH OF
ARMAGEDDON FEEL A LITTLE
CHEATED.
JIM?
>> FITZPATRICK, A 60-YEAR-OLD
RETIREE HAD PUT HIS MONEY WHERE
HIS FAITH IS SPENDING $140,000,
ALMOST EVERYTHING HE HAS, ON
HUNDREDS OF BILLBOARDS
PROCLAIMING THE COMING
ARMAGEDDON.
>>  I DON'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
HAPPENED.
THIS IS THE YEAR.
ALL THE CALCULATIONS INDICATE
THIS IS THE YEAR.
>> Stephen: HOW COULD THE
CALCULATIONS BE WRONG?
CAMPING USED THE MOST PRECISE
METHOD AVAILABLE TAKING NUMBERS
AT RANDOM FROM A 400-YEAR-OLD
ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF A GROUP
OF TANGENTIALLY RELATED ANCIENT
MIDDLE-EASTERN TEXTS TRANSCRIBED
FROM GREEK, HEBREW AND ARAMAIC
ORAL HISTORIES!
IT'S HOW I DO MY TAXES.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BACK AT YOU, MISTER.
BACK AT YOU.
AND CAMPING HIMSELF IS TAKING IT
HARD.
>>  I CAN TELL YOU VERY CANDIDLY
THAT WHEN MAY 21 CAME AND WENT,
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR
ME.
>> Stephen: YES, DIFFICULT.
NOT THE END OF THE WORLD OR
ANYTHING BUT DIFFICULT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND CAMPING IS NOT BACKING DOWN
FROM HIS DOOM-PREACHING.
>> MONDAY NIGHT PASTOR HAROLD
CAMPING WENT ON THE RADIO TO
TALK ABOUT HIS FAILED DOOMSDAY
FORECAST.
HIS EXPLANATION: SATURDAY MARKED
AN INVISIBLE JUDGMENT."
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, AN
INVISIBLE JUDGEMENT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
JESUS DID RETURN, BUT HE WAS
WEARING HIS CLOAK OF
INVISIBILITY!
[LAUGHTER]
AS PROPHESIED IN THE SEVENTH
BOOK OF THE BIBLE JESUS CHRIST
AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M STARTING TO THINK CAMPING'S
RIGHT.
SURE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIDN'T
DISAPPEAR, BUT ARE WE SURE
NOBODY GOT RAPTURED? SINCE MAY
21ST, HAS ANYONE SEEN
TED DANSON?
[LAUGHTER]
CHECK ON THAT.
IN FACT, IF THE RAPTURE WAS
INVISIBLE, IT'S POSSIBLE WE
"ALL" HAVE BEEN RAPTURED AND
JUST DON'T KNOW IT.
CUZ, I GOTTA SAY, THIS FEELS A
LOT LIKE HEAVEN TO ME: MY OWN
STUDIO, FILLED WITH ADORING
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE A COLD HOW
ABOUT AN AAAA [CROWD AWWWS]
PARADISE
PLUS I'M FAMOUS, RUGGEDLY
HANDSOME, AND I CAN MAKE A
TRIPLE-SOY LATTE APPEAR BY
CLAPPING MY HANDS.
[CLAPS]
WHAT'S MORE, I GET PAID
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR
A HALF-HOUR OF WORK EVERY NIGHT,
AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SHOUT
THINGS INTO A CAMERA THAT I'D
SHOUT INTO A MIRROR FOR FREE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO THIS COULD BE HEAVEN. BUT IF
IT ISN'T, DON'T WORRY:
EVERYTHING THAT YOU EVER KNEW
AND LOVED WILL STILL BE÷ú
DESTROYED ON CAMPING'S REVISED
RAPTURE DATE OCTOBER 21.
THAT GIVES YOU FIVE EXTRA MONTHS
TO EITHER GET RIGHT WITH GOD OR
FILL YOUR BEER HELMET WITH
FOUR LOKO AND PARTY LIKE YOU
HAVE DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.
I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
