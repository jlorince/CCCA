IT'S FUNNY.
I DIDN'T KNOW HUMANS WERE
KOSHER.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I AM SO SICK OF PEOPLE
GETTING AWAY WITH STUFF THAT I
KNOW IS WRONG.
THAT IS WHY I AM FORMING A
POSSE.
I SAY LET'S GO OUT AND STRING
'EM UP.
WHO IS WITH ME?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHOO, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
FANTASTIC.
NOW, IS ANYONE CURIOUS ABOUT WHO
WE'RE GOING TO KILL?
( LAUGHTER )
JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO
KNOW.
IT'S FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND
INTERNATIONAL ALBINO
SUPERVILLAIN JULIAN ASSANGE.
WE KNOW JUST WHERE TO FIND HIM.
>> BREAKING NEWS OUT OF EUROPE
AT THIS HOUR.
THE GLOBAL MANHUNT FOR
WIKILEAKS' FOUNDER JULIAN
ASSANGE IS OVER.
>> THE MANHUNT FOR JULIAN
ASSANGE IS OVER.
>> THE MEANT NOW OVER.
-INTERNATIONAL MANHUNT FOR
JULIAN ASSANGE IS OVER.
>> Stephen: YES, AN
INTERNATIONAL MANHUNT IN THAT A
WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR HIS
ARREST AND WITHIN HOURS HE
TURNED HIMSELF IN.
( LAUGHTER )
ASSANGE IS FACING MOLESTATION
CHARGE, WHICH HIS LAWYER HAS
TRIED TO PASS OFF AS MERELY SEX
BY SURPRISE.
( LAUGHTER )
WHICH I ASSUME MEANS HE'S SO
PALE THAT HE BLENDS INTO THE
SHEETS, SO WHEN YOU GET INTO
BED -- SURPRISE!
( APPLAUSE )
KEEP THAT HANDY, KEEP THAT
HANDY.
FOLKS, THOSE CHARGE, AN THEY ARE
DISTURBING, ARE IN SWEDEN.
WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDS ON HIM
FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE WITH
WIKILEAKS, BECAUSE THERE IS A
WORD FOR PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS DOING.
>> JULIAN ASSANGE IS ENGAGED IN
TERRORISM.
HE SHOULD BE TREATED AS AN ENEMY
COMBATANT.
>> I THINK THE MAN IS A
HIGH-TECH TERRORIST.
>> Stephen: HE IS A TERRORIST.
WE DO NOT LET TERRORISTS RUB
FREE AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS.
TIME'S ALMOST UP, BIN LADEN.
SO ASSANGE IS CLEARLY A
TERRORIST, BUT HE CLAIMS HE'S
SOMETHING EVEN MORE SINISTER.
A JOURNALIST.
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS
NOT BUYING THIS.
>> HE'S NOT A JOURNALIST.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> JULIAN ASSANGE IS NOT A
JOURNALIST.
>> MR. ASACK IS NOT A
JOURNALIST.
HE'S AN ANARCHIST, AND HE'S NOT
WORTHY OF THE PROTECTIONS OF A
JOURNALIST, BUT WE UNDERSTAND
THAT THE REPORTING OF THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT IS WHAT
JOURNALISTS DO.
>> Stephen: NAMELESS
GOVERNMENT GUY IS RIGHT.
JOURNALISTS DON'T UNCOVER
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT DOES BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS.
THEY REPORT IT WHEN SOMEONE ELSE
DOES AND THEN THAT PERSON IS
DECLARED A TERRORIST.
UNFORTUNATELY, ASSANGE IS STILL
PROTECTED BY THE FIG LEAF OF THE
FIRST AMENDMENT.
SO THERE'S ONLY ONE CIVILIZED
RESPONSE TO HIS ACTION.
>> WE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET HIM
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES.
WE'LL TAKE MATTERS INTO OUR OWN
HANDS.
>> HE COULD BE EXECUTED.
>> I'D LIKE THE SEE A LITTLE
DRONE HIT ASSANGE.
>> I THINK ASSANGE SHOULD BE
ASSASSINATED.
I THINK OBAMA SHOULD PUT OUT A
CONTRACT AND MAYBE USE A DRONE
OR SOMETHING.
>> AND THAT LAST GUY IS
CANADIAN.
COME ON, AMERICA!
WE CAN'T LET CANADA
OUT-ASSASSINATE US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE WAY THEY DO IT, BY THE WAY,
THE WAY THEY DO IT UP THERE IS,
PARDON ME, DO YOU MIND TERRIBLY
IF I ASSASSINATE YOU?
NO?
OKAY.
I'LL COME BACK.
SORRY.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, FOR SOME REASON BARACK
OBAMA WON'T ORDER EAR DRONE
STRIKE ON LONDON.
SO FAR ALL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO
IS CUT OFF THE CASH.
>> MASTERCARD RECENTLY BLOCKED
ITS CUSTOMERS TO DONATING MONEY
TO WIKILEAKS.
THAT FOLLOWED SIMILAR MOVES BY
VISA.
>> Stephen: SO IF YOU WANT TO
DONATE TO WIKILEAKS, YOU CAN'T
USE YOUR VISA OR YOUR
MASTERCARD.
THEY HAVE DRAWN A MRL LINE IN
THE SAND, BUT LUCKILY YOU CAN
STILL USE BOTH TO DONATE TO THE
KU KLUX KLAN.
( LAUGHTER )
ALTHOUGH MASTERCARD IS PREFERRED
CARD OF THE MASTER RACE.
SO WHAT... APPLAUSE
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT IN ALL OF THIS, WHAT IN ALL
OF THIS IS ASSANGE'S DEFENSE?
WELL, IN ABEDITORIAL THIS WEEK,
HE EXPLAINS, IN ITS LANDMARK
LOOKING IN THE PENTAGON PAPERS
CASE, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
SAID ONLY A FREE AND
UNRESTRAINED PRESS CAN
EFFECTIVELY EXPOSE DECEPTION IN
GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS REALLY THE FAULT OF
DANIEL ELLSBERG, THE MAN WHO
LEAKED THE PENTAGON PAPERS WHICH
EXPOSED THE GOVERNMENT'S LIES.
WE SHOULD ORDER A DRONE STRIKE
ON THAT GUY.
HERE TO SIT IN THE EXACT SAME
COORDINATES FOR AT LEAST THREE
MINUTES, PLEASE WELCOME THE MAN
WHO LEAKED THE PENTAGON PAPERS,
MR. DANIEL ELLSBERG.
MR. ELLSBERG, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING BACK.
HAVE A SEAT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS.
WATCH OUT.
LOOKS GOOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT LOOKS VERY
NATURAL ON YOU, SIR.
BEFORE WE START, IF YOU WOULD
JUST SANE THIS NON-DISCLOSURE
CLAUSE, IT'S STANDARD FOR ALL OF
MY GUESTS I CAN'T TRUST.
IT JUST SAYS "I WILL NOT SNITCH.
DANIELS ELLSBERG.
" NO?
>> I CAN'T IN GOOD FAITH.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR.
NO, NO, NO.
I'LL WEAR IT.
NOW, SIR, IS JULIAN ASSANGE A
JOURNALIST?
>> THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY.
I'M IN THE A JOURNALIST.
I'M A SOURCE.
>> Stephen: IS HE A CRIMINAL?
>> DEFINITELY NOT UNDER THE LAWS
OF THE UNITED STATES.
I WAS FIRST ONE PROSECUTED...
>> Stephen: AS A CRM YOU WERE
PROSECUTED.
>> I WAS PROSECUTED FOR THE
CHARGES THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT
AGAINST HIM.
I WAS FIRST PERSON EVER
PROSECUTED FOR A LEAK IN THIS
COUNTRY.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT.
THAT WAS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE
HAD BEEN A LOT OF LEAKS, THAT'S
BECAUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAS
REALLY KEPT US FROM HAVING AN
OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT.
>> Stephen: BUT THE FIRST
AMENDMENT ONLY COVERS
JOURNALISTS.
THAT'S FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.
WHO IS ASSANGE TO SAY HE'S A
JOURNALIST?
THE GOVERNMENT GETS TO SAY WHO
IS OR ISN'T A JOURNALIST.
IF HE WANTS THE PROVE HE'S A
JOURNALIST, HE SHOULD LEAK
WHATEVER SECRET LIST THEY VZ
THAT SAYS WHO ARE JOURNALISTS.
>> THE FOUNDING OF THIS COUNTRY
WAS ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE SAY
AS TO WHAT WE HEAR AND THINK AN
READ.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE CERTAIN
THINGS THE PUBLIC SHOULD NOT
KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT WE ELECT A
GOVERNMENT FOR, TO ACT IN SECRET
WITH COMPLETE IMPUNITY.
LATER WE'LL FIND OUT WHETHER WE
LIKED IT.
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST
TRADITIONS OF GOVERNMENT IN
HUMAN CIVILIZATION, BUT PEOPLE
DIDN'T CALL IT DEMOCRACY.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY THE SAME
THINGS BEING SAID ABOUT ASSANGE
WERE SAID ABOUT YOU BACK WHEN
YOU LIKED THE PENTAGON PAPERS.
WHAT SORT OF THINGS WERE SAID
ABOUT YOU?
>> THAT I WAS TRAITOR, THAT I
WAS TERRIBLE, THAT I WAS
GUILTY... THAT OUR DIPLOMACY
WOULD GO TO HELL.
>> Stephen: YOU LOST THE
VIETNAM WAR FOR US.
>> PAT BUCHANAN SAID THAT ON THE
AIR ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: PAT'S A FRIEND.
( LAUGHTER )
WATCH IT.
>> THAT WAS A LITTLE GRANDIOSE.
>> Stephen: WHO IS TO BLAME
HERE?
IS BRADLEY MANNING THE PRIVATE
WHO TOOK THIS INFORMATION AN
GAVE IT TO JULIAN ASSANGE, IS HE
THE PERSON WE NEED TO STRING UP
HERE?
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT.
>> Stephen: HE DID.
HE PLUGGED IT IN, DANCED TO LADY
GAGA AND TOOK ALL THE THINGS
DOWN.
THAT TURNED THE UNITED STATES
INTO A VICTIM.
WE'RE A HELPLESS, HARMLESS, MOST
POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,
AND WE WERE TAKEN DOWN WE -- BY
A PRIVATE
>> IF HE DID WHAT HE'S ACCUSED
OF DOING, I THINK HE DID GREAT
SERVICE TO THIS COUNTRY IN MANY
WAYS.
IN FACT, WE'RE NOT IN THE MESS
WE'RE IN, IN THE WORLD BECAUSE
OF TOO MANY LEAKS.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING IT'S
BETTER TO KNOW THAN NOT TO KNOW?
>> I SAY THERE SHOULD BE SOME
SECRETS, BUT I ALSO SAY WE'RE IN
IRAQ, WE INVADED IRAQ ILLEGALLY
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF A BRADLEY
MANNING HAT TIME.
WE COULD HAVE SAVED A ENORMOUS
NUMBER OF IRAQIS IF THERE HAD
BEEN PEOPLE IN THE...
>> Stephen: I WILL TELL YOU
THIS.
I USED TO AGREE WITH YOU UNTIL
WE WON.
( LAUGHTER )
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DANIEL ELLSBERG.
THE MAN WHO LEAKED THE...
PLEASE.
ONE SECOND.
I GOT TO STRING YOU.
