THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN. THANKS

WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA.
NATION, THANK YOU FOR YOURSUPPORT.
FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR YOURSUPPORT AND COMING TOGETHER TO
MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACEBECAUSE WE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES.
YOU SAY POTATO, AND I SAY WHOYOU CALLING A POTATO IS
IS IT BECAUSE I'M IRISH?
YOU'RE A RACIST.
I'M HAPPY TO SAY ALL OUR RACIALCONFLICTS ARE BEHIND US.
AS THE SAYING GOES THE ARC OFTHE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG BUT
BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE.
>> A HISTORIC RULING FROM THESUPREME COURTS COULD SPELL THE
END OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ONCOLLEGE CAMPUSES.
THE 6-2 RULE UPHOLDS A MICHIGANAMENDMENT BANNING THE USE OF
RACE IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS.
>> Stephen:  FINALLY, THISDECISION ENDS THE UNFAIR
PRACTICE OF ADMITTING STUDENTSBASED ON THEIR RACE AND ALLOWS
MORE STUDENTS TO BE ADMITTEDBASED ON IF THEIR PARENTS WENT
THERE.
( LAUGHTER )WE DON'T NEED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
BECAUSE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ISOFFICIALLY OVER.
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
JUST ASK THESE OTHER WHITEPEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> THE DREAM OF AFFIRMATIVEACTION IS-- HAS BEEN REALIZED.
IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME, BUT WE--I WOULD SAY WE'VE ARRIVED.
>> THIS IS A SCENE THAT MARTINLUTHER KING WISHED FOR.
HE WANTED THIS DAY TO COME.
HE WANTED THE LAW OF THE LAND TOFINALLY BACK OFF AND SAY YOU
KNOW WHAT?
WE DON'T NEED THIS, BECAUSETHERE IS EQUALITY
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT,AFRICAN AMERICANS.
DR. KING SAID HE MIGHT NOT MAKEIT TO THE PROMISED LAND WITH
YOU, BUT THESE GUYS DID ANDTHEY'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S LIKE M.L.K. SAID HIMSELF AT
THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON-- I HAVEA DREAM THAT ONE DAY THE SONS OF
FORMER SLAVES AND THE SONS OFFORMER SLAVE OWNERS WILL BE ABLE
TO SIT TOGETHER AT THE TABLE OFBROTHERHOOD UNLESS THERE
HAPPENS TO BE ANOTHER SLAVEOWNER'S SON WHO IS SIMILARLY
QUALIFIED THAT HE SHOULD TAKETHE SLAVE KID'S SEAT BECAUSE
IT'S NOT ABOUT QUOTAS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).GREAT MAN.
