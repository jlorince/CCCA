NEXT SUMMER THE MOVIE WILL BE HARRY REID DRIVING THE SPEED LIMIT.
WRECK IT RAVEL WAS ROBBED.
IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE THE SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK BUT THE MEDIA WON'T LET THE STORY GUN WHERE.
THE MEDIA WON'T DROP IT.
WHERE IS THE IN-DEPTH REPORTEN THE SALSA DOG?
♪ ♪ SALSA DOG:  COULD IT HAPPEN IN YOUR TOWN?
[LAUGHTER]
THIS MOREID OBSESSION WITH THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KILLED EVERY YEAR WITH GUNS IS
ALL PART OF THE MEDIA'S ANTI-GUN AGUN AGENDA IT'S AND NOT FUELING THE NRA PRESIDENT WAYNE "THE
PIERRE" LAPIERRE.
>> THE MEDIA RUSHES TO BLAME GUNS.
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
EVERYONE TIME IS SOMETHING IS SHOT THE MEDIA RUSHES TO BLAME GUNS.
TO THE MEDIA A SMOKING GUN IS ALWAYS A SMOKING GUN.
SOME JOURNALISTS ARE SO PREJUDICE AGAINST GUNS THEY'VE SUNK TO JOURNALISM.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE THERE'S NO NATIONAL DATABUSINESS OF SHOOTINGS THEY'VE BEEN TALLYING THE
SHOOTINGS SINCE NEWTOWN.
IT'S MORE THAN 30 A DAY.
I KNOW THAT NUMBER SOUNDS HIGH BUT THERE'S ONLY 28 DAYS IN FEBRUARY, REMEMBER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IN A RECENT POLL 93% OF AMERICANS FAVOR BACKGROUND CHECKS.
WE CAN'T TRUST THOSE 93%.
WE DON'T KNOW THEIR BACKGROUND.
[LAUGHTER]
LUCKILY WE CAN FIGHT THIS WILL NEGATIVE REPORTING ABOUT GUNS AND THAT BRINGS US TOP
TONIGHT'S -- BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD:  SILENT BUT DEADLY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY FACT.
IN 1993 THE JACKFOOD STAT TITIONS AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL PUBLISHED A
STUDY OF GUN HOUSEHOLDS.
NOW, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY NOT ONLY WERE GUNS INEFFECTIVE IN HOME PROTECTION BUT PEOPLE WHO
KEPT GUNS IN THEIR HOMES APPEARED TO BE AT GREATEST RISK OF HOMICIDE THAN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT.
SURE, WITH A GUN IN MY HOUSE MY FAMILY IS LESS SAFE, BUT ISN'T THAT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR MY
FAMILY'S SAFETY?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES WHY ON EARTH -- SOMEONE TELL ME -- WHY IS THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL STUDYING GUNS?
GUNS AREN'T A DISEASE.
I DIDN'T GET MY SEMIAUTOMATIC FROM SITTING ON A SO TOILET SEAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE THIS INFORMATION COULD HAVE DONE IF IT WAS IN THE WRONG HANDS.
LUCKILY THE NRA STEPPED UP.
IN 1994 THE NRA SUCCESSFULLY LOBBIED CONGRESS TO KEEP THIS RESTRICTION IN THE BUDGET.
>> Stephen: THE NRA MADE THE GOVERNMENT STOP STUDYING EFFECTS OF GUNS AND IN THE 17 YEARS
SINCE WE'VE REMAINED PERFECTLY SAFE, AS FAR AS WE KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, YEARS OF HARD NOT WORK MAY SOON BE UNDONE BECAUSE WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN
OBAMA JUST DIRECTED THE CDC TO RESUME SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON GUN VIOLENCE SAYING HE WANTS TO
PROTECT PEOPLE FROM GUNS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, ONCE AGAIN WE'RE FACING OLD OUR ENEMY FROM THE 90s.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, WE ARE FACING THE THREAT -- [ APPLAUSE ]
BRSH THE THREAT OF INFORMATION.
THANKFULLY PATRIOTS LIKE DAVID BARTNE RERKS FIGHTING BACK WITH POSITIVE STORIES OF GUNS IN OUR SCHOOLS.
>> GREAT EXAMPLE IN THE 1850'S, A SCHOOL TEACHER TEACHING A GUY IN THE WEST.
A GUY FROM NEW ENGLAND WANTS TO KILL HIM AND FIND HIM.
HE COMES INTO THE SCHOOL WITH HIS GUN TO SHOOT THE TEACHER.
HE DECIDED NOT TO SHOOT HER BECAUSE THE KIDS PULLED OUT THEIR GUNS AND SAID YOU KILL THE
TEACH YERK YOU DIE.
OKAY.
REAL SIM STUFFS.
>> Stephen: REMEMBER, GUNS ARE LIKE GUM, YOU HAVE TO BRING ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE CLASS.
[LAUGHTER]
THE BLOGOCHATS ARE SAYING HE LIFTED THAT STORY FROM THE LOUIE L'AMOUR BENDIGO SHAFTER.
IS THAT REALLY A BOOK?
IT SOUNDS LOOK A NORTH AMERICAN PORN STAR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN IF HE BORROWED IT FROM A BOOK THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TAKING A STORY FROM A BOOK AND
SAYING IT'S REAL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE ONLY THING OUT THERE THAT CAN STOP A BAD GUY WITH GOOD INFORMATION ASK A GOOD GUY WITH
BAD INFORMATION LIKE NRA PRESIDENT WAYNE LAPIERRE.
>> IF A TORNADO HIT, A HURRICANE HIT, IF A RIDE OCCURS, THEY ARE OUT THERE ALONE AND THE ONLY WAY
THEY ARE GOING TO PROTECT THEM SELF-IN THE COLD, IN THE DARK, WHEN THEY ARE VULLER IN IMRABL
WITH A FIREARM.
>> Stephen: YES, IF ONLY SOMEBODY THREATEN HURRICANE SANDY WITH A SHOTGUN.
THE NORTHEAST WON'T BE IN THIS -- WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.
[LAUGHTER]
TOP COUNTER ALL THE NEGATIVE STORIES ABOUT GUNS OUT THERE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW WAYNE AND DAVID
AND MAKE UP POSITIVE STORIES ABOUT GUNS.
FOR INSTANCE,:  DID YOU KNOW THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE DENTISTS RECOMMEND THAT YOU OWN A GUN?
[LAUGHTER]
OR THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN ACTUALLY DIED FROM -- [LAUGHTER]
JOIN ME FROM STANDING UP AGAINST ANY ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GUNS.
LET THE CDC KNOW THEY CAN TAKE OUR
