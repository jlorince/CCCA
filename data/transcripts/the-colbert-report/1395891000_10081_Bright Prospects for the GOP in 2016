>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THAAKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THE MIDTERM ELECTIONSARE AROUND THE CORNER AND IF THE
POLLSTERS ARE RIGHT THESE WILLBE THE GREATEST MIDTERMS EVER.
>> WE ARE GETTING REPORTEDTONIGHT AS WHAT IS BEING
DESCRIBED AS A DEMOCRATIC PARTYFREAK OUT AFTER A BIG
PREDICTION FROM POLL WATCHERNATE SILVER, THE POLITICAL
ANALYST WHO NAILED 2012PRESIDENTIAL RESULTS WELL IN
ADVANCE, AND NOW HE ISPREDICTING THAT REPUBLICANS WILL
LIKELY WIN CONTROL OF THESENATE.
>> SILVER PREDICT THATREPUBLICANS HAVE A 60%-- THAT'S
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE-- OF TAKINGCONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE THIS
YEAR.
>> Stephen:  60%.
THAT IS ALMOST HALF.
( CHEERS )AND WHY DOES SILVER THINK THE
REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE THESENATE?
BECAUSE AS COMPARED WITH 2010,OR 2012, THE G.O.P. HAS DONE A
BETTER JOB OF RECRUITINGCREDIBLE CANDIDATES.
REALLY?
MORE CREDIBLE THAN 2012?
THE REPUBLICANS HAD SERIOUSPEOPLE LIKE SHARON ANGLE AND
RICHARD MOURDOCK AND A STICK OFBUTTER WITH GOOGLY EYES.
NEVERTHELESS -- GOOD GUY, GOODMAN.
NEVERTHELESS, THIS YEAR, THEG.O.P. HAS STEPPED UP ITS GAME
WITH EVEN INCREDIBLER CANDIDATESLIKE IOWA'S JONI ERNST WHO IS
RUNNING ON A PLATFORM EVERYONECAN GET BEHIND.
I GREW UP CASTRATING HOGS ON ANISLAND.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  SOLD!
JONI, JONI YOU HAD MEAT CASTRATION.
FOLKS, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHATELSE SHE STANDS FOR.
I AM PULLING FOR HER WHOLE HOG,OR WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THE HOG
WHEN SHE'S DONE WITH IT.
FOLKS, I THINK EVERYONE SHOULDKNOWWABOUT JONI'S HISTORY OF HOG
CASTRATION, NOT JUST THE PEOPLESHE'S LEGALLY REQUIRED TO TELL
WHEN SHE MOVES INTO A NEWNEIGHBORHOOD.
( LAUGHTER )AMERICA NEEDS MORE SENATORS WHO
ARE FARM TOUGH.
I MEAN, WHILE THE OTHER LITTLEGIRLS WERE READING "CHARLOTTE'S
WEB,""JONI WAS OUT BACK WITHTINSNIPS MAKING A SOPRANO OUT OF
WILBUR.
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME, FOLKS,WHEN IT CAME TIME TO PLAY WITH
BARBIES, JONI TOOK ONE LOOK DOWNKEN'S PANTS AND SAID, "MY WORK
HERE IS DONE."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND--
( CHEERS  AND ERNST ALREADY GOT MITT
ROMNEY'S ENDORSEMENT, AND SHECAN HAVE MINE, TOO, IF SHE COMES
NOWHERE NEAR ME.
( LAUGHTER )I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA DEMANDS
SENATORS WITH BALLS, AND I'MGUESSING JONI'S GOT A DUMPSTER
FULL OF THEM.
( APPLAUSE )SO SENATE CANDIDATES, IF YOU
WANT TO WIN, YOU MAKE MORE ADSLIKE JONI'S THAT PROVE YOU HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO CHANGEWASHINGTON LIKE THIS.
HI, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT.
AND I GREW UP KILLING DUCKS INTHE PARK WITH A TACK HAMMER.
WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD, I BEATA RACCOON TO DEATH WITH A CINDER
BLOCK AND MY HEART RATE NEVERWENT ABOVE 80 BEATS PER MINUTE.
THIS HERE IS MY SHED.
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT IGOT IN THERE.
BUT YOU SEND ME TO WASHINGTON,I'LL PUT MORE THINGS IN MY SHED.
IN FACT, I'M GOING TO NEED ABIGGER SHED.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT IN 2014.
