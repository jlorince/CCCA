( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BARK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SWORE UP AND
DOWN SHE WOULD NEVER APPEAR ON
MY SHOW SO DON'T TELL HER THIS
ISN'T THE SET OF THE "PRICE IS
RIGHT."
PLEASE WELCOME DEMOCRATIC
LEADER, NANCY PELOSI.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MADAM SPEAK ETHANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
WELL, YOU YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
YOU'D NEVER COME ON HERE BUT DO
YOU-- DO YOU OFTEN BREAK YOUR
PROMISES?
>> WELL, THIS IS PART OF MY LENT
RESOLUTION, TO DO GOOD WORK, BE
KIND TO REPUBLICANS, SO HERE I
AM.
( LAUGHTER ).
( CHEERS )
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, THANK
YOU.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen:
( NICE WITH THE LATIN.
YOU'RE A CATHOLIC, I'M A
CATHOLIC.
WHY NO ASHES?
>> LATER.
>> Stephen:  LATER?
YOU KNOW, THIS IS BROADCAST AT
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO GET ON IT.
>> IT'S CALIFORNIA IT'S THREE
HOURS EARLIER.
>> Stephen:  EXACTLY.
IT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT JESUS
DIDN'T ANTICIPATE.
( LAUGHTER ).
ADAM, YOU KNOW, I'M GRATEFUL
THAT YOU CAME ON, BUT YOU HAVE
ATTACKED ME.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  YOU HAVE ATTACKED
ME IN THE SPRN OF OF MY SUPERPAC
BY SAYING SUPERPACS AND I,
SPECIFICALLY, AM HURTING
DEMOCRACY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> I THINK IF WE WANT TO CANCEL
ELECTIONS AND JUST HAVE THE
WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE
AMERICA-- ANDUN WHAT THEIR NAMES
ARE-- GIVE MILLIONS, TENS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, WE CAN JUST
ASK THEM WHO DO THEY WANT TO BE
PRESIDENT?
WHO DO THEY WANT TO RUN
CONGRESS?
WHO DO THEY WANT TO BE GOVERNOR?
>> Stephen:  THAT WOULD BE
POLITE.
>> NO, THAT WOULD BE A PLU
PLUTOCRACY, AND WE ARE A
DEMOCRACY AND OUR FOUNDERS
INTENDED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD
DECIDE NOT--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, NOW
YOU'VE HIT ON SOMETHING.
YOU'VE HIT ON SOMETHING.
IN THE CITIZENS UNITED DECISION,
THE SUPREME COURT MADE TWO YEARS
AGO, THEY SAID BECAUSE
CORPORATIONS ARE LEGALLY PEOPLE,
AND BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE THE
RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND BECAUSE
MONEY IS SPEECH, THEREFORE,
CORPORATIONS HAVE THE RIGHT AND
INDIVIDUALS AND UNIONS TO SPEND
UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN
POLITICAL SPEECH.
SO WHY DO YOU NOT WANT PEOPLE TO
HAVE THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH?
>> WELL, I DO, BUT --
>> Stephen:  BUT THESE ARE
PEOPLE.
AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SPEAK
WITH THEIR MONEY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> ARE THE ME SAY I WANT THEM TO
DISCLOSE.
I THINK THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT
TO KNOW AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO
STAND BY THEIR AD.
IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TEBZ OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY'RE
PUTTING UP FOR A CANDIDATE OR
CAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT
TO KNOW BY WHOSE AUTHORITY IS
THIS COMING TO THEM.
>> Stephen:  THIS IS PART OF
THE DISCLOSE ACT.
TELL PEOPLE WHAT THE DISCLOSE
ACT WOULD DO.
YOU HAVE A FETTIVISH FOR
TRANSPARENCY.
>> ACTUALLY, THIS IS WOULD BE
GOOD FOR YOU.
BECAUSE YOUR AMERICANS FOR A
BETTER TOMORROW, TOMORROW, COULD
BECOME AMERICANS FOR A BETTER
TOMORROW, TODAY, IF YOU COULD --
>> Stephen:  WE CAN'T DO THAT
BECAUSE IT'S TOMORROW.
>> NOT IN CALIFORNIA.
>> Stephen:  OH, EXACTLY.
TOMORROW--
( APPLAUSE )
CALIFORNIA IS STILL 1967.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY.
SO HOW DOES THIS HELP?
>> WELL, IT HELPS IN THIS WAY.
FIRST, WE WANT TO DISCLOSE.
THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHOSE MONEY IS COMING IN THERE,
INSTEAD OF SOME FEW-- THE BANK
ROLL OF A FEW DETERMINING THE
OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS RATHER THAN
THE VOICES OF PEOPLE, DISCLOSE.
STAND BY YOUR ADS.
WIN THE ELECTION, REFORM THE
SYSTEM, OVERTURN THE SUPREME
COURT DECISION BY AMENDING THE
CONSTITUTION AND GIVE THE VOTE
AND THE VOICE AND THE POWER TO
THE PEOPLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  BUT IF PEOPLE
KNEW--
( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU FOR APPLAUDING THE
CORPORATIONS.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT IF PEOPLE KNEW WHAT
BUSINESSES WERE GIVING MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO
INDIVIDUAL POLITICAL CANDIDATES,
ISN'T THERE A CHANCE THAT THE
CONSUMERS WOULD RETALIATE
AGAINST THOSE BUSINESSES BY NOT
BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS?
>> THAT'S WHY THE BUSINESSES
DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE.
>> Stephen:  EXACTLY, BECAUSE
IT'S NOT FAIR TO, SAY, BRAWNY
TOWELS.
>> FOR EXAMPLE --
>> Stephen:  FOR PEOPLE TO
FIND OUT THAT THE KOCH BROTHERS
OWN BRAWNY TOWELS AND OWN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> EXACTLY.
( LAUGHTER )
AND WANT TO OWN THE PRESIDENCY.
>> Stephen:  OF COURSE YOU
WANT TO OWN THE PRESIDENCY
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP THE RECEIPT,
YOU CAN CHANGE HIM FOR A NEW
PRESIDENT IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIM.
THAT'S JUST LOGICAL.
THAT'S BUSINESS.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN BUSINESS,
MADAM.
I SAY LET THE FREE MARKET DECIDE
WHO REPRESENTS US.
>> WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING FOR
THE FREE MARKET, AND I SUPPORT
THE FREE MARKET.
BUT I ALSO SUPPORT FREE
ELECTIONS.
>> Stephen:  CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?
CAN WE TALK ABOUT CONGRESS IN
GENERAL FOR A SECOND RIGHT HERE?
YOU'VE BEEN IN CONGRESS AWE LONG
TIME --
>> 25 YEARS.
IT'S MY ANNIVERSARY.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU.
>> I'M HERE FOR MY 25th
ANNIVERSARY.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen:  THEY ARE HOLDING
HEARINGS IN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES RIGHT NOW ABOUT
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION.
OKAY.
IT'S A BUNCH OF GUYS UP THERE.
>> RIGHT, FIVE GUYS, FIVE GUYS.
THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT FOR
HAMBURGERS BUT NOT FOR --
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST FIVE GUYS UP THERE
HOLDING THIS?
AREN'T GUYS REALLY THE ONES WHO
SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BECAUSE
WE'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF TELLING THE
LADY IT'S REALLY HER
RESPONSIBILITY.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> YOU HAVE DEFINED THE PROBLEM
VERY WELL.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
BUT-- DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU
TARTED IN CONGRESS 25 YEARS AGOS
THAT YOU'D BE DEBATING
CONTRACEPTION 25 YEARS LATER?
>> WELL, I KNEW OVER THE YEARS
THAT WE TRIED TO TELL PEOPLE
THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE IN
CONGRESS, BUT, FRANKLY, THEY
DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.
>> Stephen:  AS A CONSERVATIVE
CATHOLIC, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,
EITHER.
RICK SANTORUM AND I,UN-- YOU
KNOW, WE LOVE MAKING BABIES.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT'S-- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
WHY ARE WOMEN-- WHY ARE WOMEN SO
OBSESSED WITH CONTROLLING THEIR
OWN BODY?
( LAUGHTER )
>> THIS IS A WOMEN'S HEALTH
ISSUE.
AND THE SIZE AND TIMING OF
FAMILY --
>> Stephen:  SIZE DOES NOT
MATTER, MADAM.
( LAUGHTER )
ISN'T IT A QUESTION OF WOMEN'S
RIGHTS?
>> NOT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
IT'S A WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUE
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO EVERY
FAMILY.
A MOTHER'S HEALTH AND THE HEALTH
OF THER CHILDREN AS SHE AND HER
HUSBAND AND THEIR DOCTOR AND
THEIR GOD DECIDE WHAT THAT IS.
BUT IT ISN'T UP TO FIVE GUYS
SITTING AROUND THE TABLE IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO DETERMINE
WHAT THAT-- WHAT THAT SIZE AND
TIMING WILL BE.
NOW, I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN.
THEY'RE ALL GROWN, I HAVE
GRANDCHILDREN --
>> Stephen:  CONGRATULATIONS.
>> YES, YES, YES I'M VERY PROUD
OF THAT.
I AM, SHOULD I SAY, A PRACTICING
CATHOLIC, BY THE BOOK-- I LOVE
MY CHURCH --
>> Stephen:  I DON'T NEED TO
KNOW.
>> MORE INFORMATION.
>> Stephen:  DON'T NEED TO
KNOW, DON'T NEED TO KNOW.
>> I RESPECT WHAT MR. SANTORUM
HINKS AND BELIEVES FOR HIMSELF,T
BUT I THINK-- I THINK THAT IT
WOULD BE WISE FOR THE DWAM TO THE GENTLE
TO UNDERSTAND, MAYBE THEY NEED A
LESSON IN THE BIRDS AND BEES OR
WHATEVER IT IS, BUT THERE HAS TO
BE ANOTHER WAY.
>> Stephen:  CAN WE MAKE A
DEAL?
>> ANYTHING.
>> Stephen:  THIS DISCLOSE
ACT, IS IT FORTUNATE YOU?
>> YES, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen:  IF I THROW MY
WEIGHT BEHIND THE DISCLOSE ACT,
IF I SUPPORT DISCLOSE ACT, WILL
YOU ENCOURAGE THE DEMOCRATIC
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES TO DO MY "BETTER
KNOW A DISTRICT" SERIES?
>> IT'S A DEAL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  IT'S A DEAL!
LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA'S 8th
UP ON THE BOARD!
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY JUST SPARKED
UP SOME MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
NANCY PELOSI, EVERYBODY.
THE DISCLOSE ACT.
IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
