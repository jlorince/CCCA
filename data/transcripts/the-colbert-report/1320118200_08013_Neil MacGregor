(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
DIRECTOR OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM
WHO IS TELLING THE STORY OF THE
WORLD THROUGH OBJECTS.
I HEAR ONE OF THE ITEMS IS AN
ANCIENT ARTIFACT CALLED A BOOK.
PLEASE WELCOME NEIL MacGREGOR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU MR. McGREGOR, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR
OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM AS I SAID
BEFORE AND THE AUTHOR OF A NEW
BOOK CALLED "A HISTORY OF THE
WORLD IN 100 OCTOBERS."
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WE'LL GET TO THE
BOOK IN JUST A MOMENT BUT I HAVE
A BONE TO PICK WITH MUSEUMS IN
GENERAL.
WHY?
A LOT OF THAT STUFF SEEMS LIKE
IT MUST BE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY.
WHY NOT SELL IT?
RIGHT?
WHY KEEP IT?
WHY NOT SHARE IT WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD BY LETTING ME BUY
IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I CAN'T SELL IT TO YOU
BECAUSE YOU OWN IT ALREADY.
IT BELONGS TO YOU.
THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE
MUSEUM IS THAT IT BELONGS
EQUALLY TO EVERYBODY.
THIS MUSEUM IS THE FIRST
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THAT SORT AND
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING
PARLIAMENT SAID THIS CAN'T BE
SOLD, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GET IN
FREE FROM THE WHOLE WORLD IF
POSSIBLE.
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE PERSON
OWNING, IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY
USING AND ENJOYING.
>> BUT WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM
MUSEUMS WHEN WE GO IN
>> YOU LEARN WHO YOU ARE.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT IN THERE.
>> YOU WILL BE.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK SO?
>> YOU MIGHT BE, YOU MIGHT BE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SMART GUY.
>> WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT IS
WHY... WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT NOW WHAT PEOPLE HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT.
>> Stephen: SEX?
>> SEX.
>> Stephen: MONEY?
>> MONEY.
POWER.
SNOOD FOOD.
>> FOOD.
TRADE, TRADE AND GOD.
THAT'S IT, REALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, IT'S CALLED
"THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN 100
OBJECTS."
IS THE BIBLE IN HERE?
>> NO, THE BIBLE IS NOT THERE
THERE.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THE BIBLE
COULD JUST BE THE BOOK.
YOU COULD JUST TAKE THIS, THIS
LITTLE SLEEVE RIGHT HERE AND
WRAP IT AROUND THE BIBLE.
AND THEN YOU GOT THE HISTORY OF
THE WORLD IN ONE OBJECT.
>> YUP.
BUT WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS TELL
YOU WHAT GOD WANTED US TO BE.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> WHAT THIS DOES IS TELL US
WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN AND
WHAT WE ARE.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT'S CLEVER.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS CLEVER.
THAT'S CLEVER.
>> THANK AND THIS TELLS US THAT
WE'RE NOT WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE
BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH SEX,
POWER, MONEY, ALL THE REST.
>> Stephen: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE THINGS YOU'VE GOT IN HERE.
THE FIRST OBJECT YOU HAVE IN
HERE, CHRONOLOGICALLY THE FIRST
OBJECT IS YOU GOT A ROCK.
YOU'VE GOT AN OLD STONE SHOPPING
TOOL.
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE HERE?
>> THIS IS WHY WE'RE ALL HERE
AND THIS IS WHY WE ALL HAVE
BRAINS.
THAT WAS MADE ABOUT 1.MILLION
YEARS AGO IN EAST AFRICA.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES IT DO?
IT
>> IT GETS DEAD MEAT OFF DEAD
ANIMALS THEN YOU CAN EAT IT.
>> Stephen: LIKE A PREHISTORIC
SLAP-CHOP.
>> EXACTLY LIKE IT.
AND IT'S BECAUSE WE COULD MAKE
THAT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET
THE MEAT, BREAK THE BONES, GET
THE MARROW, GET THE PROTEINS,
GET THE BRAINS TO COME AND LIVE
EVERYWHERE.
>> Stephen: LET'S LOOK AT THE
NEXT ONE.
A SOLAR POWERED LAMP AND
CHARGER.
I DON'T GET THIS ONE BECAUSE IF
THIS SUN IS SHINING BRIGHT
ENOUGH TO CHARGE IT, I DON'T
NEED A LAMP.
>> (LAUGHS)
DID I NAIL YOU?
I THINK YOU BLEW THIS ONE.
>> IF YOU WERE LIVING... IF YOU
WERE TRYING TO COOK IN A HUT IN
AFRICA YOU WOULD BE JOLLY
GRATEFUL FOR THIS.
>> Stephen: JOLLY GRATEFUL?
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
WHY?
>> VERY.
VERY.
IS.
>> Stephen: WHY?
>> BECAUSE THIS FOR THE FIRST
TIME EVER LETS PEOPLE WHO DON'T
HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY HAVE
ACCESS TO LIGHT AT NIGHT.
>> Stephen: THE SUN DOESN'T
SHINE AT NIGHT.
>> YOU STORE IT UP IN THAT
LITTLE BIT ON THE LEFT.
YOU STORE IT UP IN THE BATTERY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
I'LL READ THE BOOK.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: THE NEXT THING HERE
IS WE HAVE THE AKON DRUM?
WHAT'S THAT?
>> THIS IS A DRUM THAT WAS MADE
FOR A CHIEF WEST AFRICA BUT IT
WAS THEN... WE KNOW THAT BUT IT
WAS BOUGHT IN 173030 AS AN
INDIAN DRUM IN THE PLANTATION OF
VIRGINIA.
THIS CAME WITH THE SLAVES FROM
THE PLANTATIONS IN AMERICA.
THIS IS THE TEXT THEY DIDN'T
HAVE TO TELL US ABOUT THEIR
HISTORY.
>> Stephen: SO THIS IS LIKE
THEIR BOOK.
>> THIS IS.
>> Stephen: WAS THIS CLEVER OF
ME TO SAY?
LOOF
>>
(LAUGHTER)
>> UM... YEAH, YEAH.
(LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US MR. McGREGOR.
NEIL McGREGOR.
THE BOOK IS "THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD IN 100 OBJECTS."
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW I'VE READ.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
