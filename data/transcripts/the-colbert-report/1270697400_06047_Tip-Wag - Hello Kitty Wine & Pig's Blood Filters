( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, THIS IS NO SURPRISE,
BUT AS AN AMERICAN, I DON'T CARE
FOR THE BRITISH.
( LAUGHTER ).
FRANKLY I WISH THEY'D SHUT THEIR
STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE HOLE, BUT
EVIDENTLY THOSE TOFFEE-NOSED,
PUDDING-FACED CRUMPET SUCKERS
STILL MAKE NEWS.
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME, JIM?
>> BIG NEWS OUT OF ENGLAND WHERE
THE ROYAL FAMILY ANNOUNCES
THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER
ROYAL WEDDING.
AFTER ALL THE RUMORS AND THE
SPECULATION, THE ROYAL FAMILY
SAID THAT PRINCE WILLIAM POPPED
THE QUESTION TO HIS LONG-TIME
LOVE KATE MIDDLETON.
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD!
THERE'S GOING TO BE A ROYAL
WEDDING.
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY
GOD, IT'S BEEN SO LONG!
I'M SO EXCITED.
OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T THINK THIS
DAY WOULD EVER COME.
WILL AND KATE HAVE BEEN DATING
FOR EIGHT YEARS.
THEY BROKE UP IN 2007 BUT THEN
THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER.
THEN THEY ALMOST BROKE UP AGAIN
BECAUSE THERE WERE RUMORS THAT
WILL WAS CHEATING BUT HE WOULD
NEVER HURT HER LIKE, THAT AND
NOW THEY'RE ENGAGED.
NOT THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN SOME
PROBLEMS.
THE BRITISH MEDIA HAS HOUND MISS
MIDDLETON BECAUSE SHE COMES FROM
NEW MONEY, CALLING HER KATE
MIDDLE CLASS AND MOCKING HER
MOTHER, A FORMER FLIGHT
ATTENDANT, FOR CHEWING GUM AND
USING INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE IN
FRONT OF THE QUEEN, SUCH AS
SAYING "PARDON" WHEN SHE SHOULD
SAY, "I BEG YOUR PARDON" AND
"TOILET" WHEN SHE SHOULD SAY, "I
BEG YOUR TOILET.
" BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS NOW
BECAUSE IT'S OFFICIAL.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK.
LOOK HOW HAPPY THOSE CAMERAS ARE
MAKING THEM.
AND HE GAVE HER DIANA'S RING,
OH, MY GOD, I AM SORRY.
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
PARDON ME.
I MEAN, I BEG YOUR TOILET.
IT IS JUST SO, SO BEAUTIFUL.
OH, MY GOD.
I AM BEING SUCH A ANYONEY NINNY
CODDLE.
OF COURSE, THERE IS A HINT OF
SCANDAL IN ALL OF THIS IN THAT I
HAVE NOT BEEN INVITED YET.
I KNOW CALLIGRAPHY TAKES TIME,
FOLKS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
INFORM THE ROYAL FAMILY THAT I
HAVE TAKEN OUT A SPECIAL POST
OFFICE BOX EXCLUSIONIVELY TO
RECEIVE THE WEDDING INVITATION.
I DON'T WANT TO MISS IT IF IT
GETS STUCK IN BETWEEN MY POTTERY
BARN CATALOG AND MY THREE OTHER
POTTERY BARN CATALOGS.
SO HERE'S THE ADDRESS, THE
REVEREND SIR STEPHEN COLBERT, PO
BOX 1958, RADIOCITY STATION NEW
YORK, NEW YORK, 10101.

FAMILY ONLY, AND INVITATIONS
