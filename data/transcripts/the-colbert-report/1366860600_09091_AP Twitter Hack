STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: VERY NICE.
VERY NICE.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE.
VERY GOOD PEOPLE.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT WAS DONE WITH ALL THE
PRECISION OF A SYNCHRONIZED SWIM
TEAM.
IF SWIM TEAMS CHANTED AND THERE
WAS NO WATER.
YOU WATCH THE NEWS.
PEOPLE SAY THE ECONOMY IS IN
DUMPS.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M DOING OKAY.
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STOCK
MARKET IS NEAR RECORD HIGHS.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET
THEIR OWN HEDGE FUND.
OF COURSE NO MATTER HOW STRONG
IT SEEMS THE MARKET CAN
SOMETIMES OVERREACT TO BAD NEWS
AND YESTERDAY THE DOW WAS A BIT
OF A DRAMA QUEEN!
JIM?
>> IF YOU BLINK YOU MISSED IT.
WE HAD A MINI-FLASH CRASH THIS
HOUR.
>> THE DOW JONES AVERAGE FELL
NEARLY 150 POINTS IN TWO
MINUTES.
THE MARKET REGAINED THE LOSSES
FIVE MINUTES LATER.
>> Stephen: FOR INVESTORS LIKE
ME, IT WAS A REAL ROLER COASTER
RIDE.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I BLEW $16
FOR THE SOUVENIR PHOTO.
NOW EVEN MORE UNNERVING WAS WHAT
CAUSED THE CRASH.
>> TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS TWEETED ABOUT
EXPLOSIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
AND INJURIES TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> THAT IMMEDIATELY SENT WALL
STREET OFF INTO A TAILSPIN FOR A
DRAMATIC FEW MINUTES.
>> TO HAVE THAT KIND OF IMPACT
FROM A 140 CHARACTER TWEET, THAT
IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIGNIFICANT.
>> Stephen: NOW, IT TURNED OUT
TO BE FALSE INFORMATION.
STILL IT WAS THE MOST
EARTH-SHATTERING TWEET SINCE THE
TWIT-PIC OF DAN KISSING ALI WHEN
HE'S STILL DATING JESSICA.
I MEAN HASH TAG MAN SLUT.
IT TURNS OUT THE A.P.'S TWITTER
FEED WAS HACKED BY A GROUP
CALLING ITSELF THE SYRIAN
ELECTRONIC ARMY.
I SAW THEM AT BONNAROO IN 2006.
THEY'RE AMAZING.
ANYWAY, IT FOOLED WALL STREET
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND,
THESE TRADERS ON WALL STREET ARE
ONLY HUMAN.
EXCEPT THIS ONE TIME.
>> HUMAN BEINGS WEREN'T MAKING
THESE TRADES.
THESE WERE COMPUTERS.
ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO SCAN THE
HEADLINES AND FIND NEGATIVE OR
POSITIVE WORDS AND THEN HELP
COMPANIES PROFIT ON THE RESULTS.
>> THEY'RE LOOKING FOR KEY WORDS
LIKE EXPLOSION, WHITE HOUSE,
PRESIDENT, OBAMA.
THEY READ THOSE WORDS IN THAT
FAKE A.P. TWEET AND IMMEDIATELY
TRIGGERED MASSIVE SELLING OF
STOCK.
NO HUMAN BEINGS INVOLVED
WHATSOEVER.
>> Stephen: NATION, THIS IS A
MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN COMPUTING.
WE NOW HAVE MACHINES THAT CAN
RECEIVE BAD NEWS AND FLIP THEIR
[BLEEP] MILLIONS OF TIMES FASTER
THAN ANY HUMAN
