( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
BESTSELLING AUTHOR WHOSE NEW
BOOK IS CALLED "COOKED: A
NATURAL HISTORY OF
TRANSFORMATION."
I'VE PRESET MY OVEN TO
FAHRENHEIT 451.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL POLLAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MICHAEL.
>> HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
>> Stephen:  GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK.
>> SURE.
I BROUGHT MY CARD.
MY COLBERT SUB CLUB CARD.
>> Stephen: TIMING HERE,
JUST--
>> WHAT DO I GET?
>> Stephen:  YOU GET A FREE
FOOT LONG.
EVERYBODY KNOWS, THE AUDIENCE
KNOWS WHO YOU ARE, BUT FOR
PEOPLE AT HOME WHO MAY HAVE
LIFTED IN A CAVE THE LAST FEW
YEARS, YOU'RE THE BESTSELLING
AUTHOR IN DEFENSE OF FOOD, FOOD
RULES.
AND NOW YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK
CALLED "COOKED: A NATURAL
HISTORY OF TRANSFORMATION."
OKAY, MICHAEL, YOU HAVE A
FOOD BOOK PROBLEM.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY?
NO MATTER HOW MANY FOOD BOOKS
YOU WRITE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
FILL THAT HOLE INSIDE OF YOU.
>> IT'S A WRITING DISORDER.
>> COLBERT: WHAT'S THE LATEST
FLIM-FLAMIN THIS ONE?
DO I HAVE TO HAVE THE COW SIGN A
RELEASE OR SOMETHING LIKE, THAT
PLAY MOZART FOR MY TOMATOES.
>> MUCH EASIER, MUCH EASIER.
>> Stephen:  WHAT'S YOUR STORY
HERE.
>> THE STORY IS AFTER FOLLOWING
THE FOOD CHAIN FROM THE FARM TO
YOUR BODY EYE WROTE BOOKS ABOUT
FARMING, I WROTE BOOKS ABOUT
HEALTH.
>> Stephen:  EVERYTHING IS
CORN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  GO AHEAD.
>> AND I REALIZED THE CENTRAL
LINK IN THE FOOD CHAIN WHERE WE
TRANSFORM THE STUFF COMING OFF
THE FARMS INTO MEALS IS THE KEY
LINK.
IT EXPLAINS THE HEALTH PROBLEM
IN THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT YOUR DIET IS NOT A
NUTRIENT BUT AN ACTIVITY--
COOKING.
SO THE QUESTION ABOUT YOUR DIET
IS NOT WHAT ARE YOU EATING BUT
WHO IS COOKING IT?
IS IT A HUMAN BEING --
>> Stephen:  CONSUELA.
ARE YOU SAYING THESE SHE'S NOT A
GOOD COOK?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
>> I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
IF YOU CAN AFFORD CONSUELA,
FANTASTIC.
AS LONG AS A HUMAN BEING IS
COOKING FOR YOU AND NOT A
CORPORATION, YOU'RE FINE.
>> Stephen:  CORPORATION CAN
COOK SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY
THAN HUMANS.
THEY HAVE GIANT VATS AND HUGE
MACHINES THAT EXTRUDE FOOD AT MY
FACE.
MACHINES DO IT BETTER SOMETIMES.
LIKE, I CAN'T-- I CAN'T MAKE
FUNIONS AT HOME.
>> AND I CAN'T MAKE CHEESE
NOODLES.
THEY MAKE THAT KIND OF FOOD--
LIKE FRENCH FRIES TOO EASY.
IF YOU WERE COOK AT HOME HOW
OFTEN WOULD YOU MAKE FRENCH
FRIES?
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE FRENCH FRIES.
>> GOOD.
YOU WON'T MAKE THEM THAT OFTEN.
WHEN CORPORATIONS COOK FRENCH
FRIES FOR US, WE EAT THEM TWO OR
THREE DIFFERENT TIMES A DAY.
THEY USE CHEAP INGREDIENTS AND
LOT OF ADDITIVES TO KEEP THE
FOOD LOOKING FRESHER AND --
>> Stephen:  AND CRUNCHY.
>> AND CRUNCHY.
>> Stephen:  AND CRISP.
>> BUT THOSE ADDITIVES ARE NOT
SO GOOD FOR US.
THEY COOK WITH LOTS OF CHEMICALS
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE IN YOUR
PANTRY.
>> Stephen:  THE BOOK IS SPLIT
UP INTO EARTH, AIR, FIRE.
IS THIS EATING PHILOSOPHY BASED
AT ALL ON THE BAND EARTH, WIND,
AND FIRE.
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE I BASE ALL MY EATING ON
THE BAND MEATLOAF.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THESE
DIFFERENT SECTIONS?
EARTH, AIR, FIRE-- THERE'S A
WATER SECTION, TOO.
>> COOKING IS ABOUT
TRANSFORMATIONS OF NATURE INTO
FOOD.
IT'S A MEAL.
AND THERE ARE FOUR MAIN
TRANSFORMATION.
WE COOK WITH FIRE, BARBECUEUE
KNOW ALL ABOUT BARBECUE.
WE COOK IN POTS, WATERS, STEWS,
AND BRAZES.
AIR IS BAKE.
WE INJECT AIR INTO FOOD TO MAKE
IT MORE DELICIOUS AND
NUTRITIOUS, AND EARTH IS COOKING
WITH MICROBE WHICH IS KIND OF
THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL.
THERE'S A LOT OF BACTERIA IN THE
SOIL, AND WE USE BACTERIA TO
FERMENT, TOO, AND FUNGUS.
>> Stephen:  LIKE BEER.
>> BEER, EXACTLY.
BEER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE,
SAUERKRAUT.
THESE FOODS ARE ALL COOKED WOULD
WITHOUT THE USE OF HEAT.
>> Stephen:  DO I HAVE TO MAKE
MY OWN BEER OR I CAN DRINK--
GEE.
>> Stephen:  CAN I DRINK BUD
LIGHT LIME.
>> YES, YOU CAN.
LOOK, THERE ARE CERTAIN KINDS OF
COOKING WE OUTSOURCE, AND BEER
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.
ALTHOUGH I DO MAKE BEER.
I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE BEER FOR
THE BOOK.
IT WAS KIND OF FUN AND
SATISFYING.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE A
SHAME FOOD?
DOES MICHAEL POLLAN HAVE A SHAME
FOOD, THE SORT OF THING IF YOU
CONFESSED YOU ATE IT, EVERYONE
WOULD SAY, "THAT MAN IS A
FRAUD?"
WHAT IS IT?
>> WELL, IF I'M BUYING FOOD IN A
GAS STATION, WHICH I DON'T
RECOMMEND DOING, BUT
OCCASIONALLY --
>> Stephen:  IT'S CREATED BY
RAW INGREDIENTS.
>> I LIKE CRACKERJACKS.
>> Stephen:  OH... THAT'S
HARDLY THE WORST THING IN THE
WORLD.
>> THANK YOU, THAT'S VERY
COMFORTING.
>> Stephen:  THEY'VE BEEN
MAKING IT FOR, LIKE, 120 YEARS,
RIGHT.
>> IT'S A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN
FOOD.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU EAT THE
PRIZE?
THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE
NUTRITION IS IN THE CRACKERJACK
BOX.
>> THE PRIZES AREN'T WHAT THEY
USED TO BE.
THEY'RE ALL PAPER NOW.
>> Stephen:  I GET SHOCKED BY
THE THINGS I READ.
AM I GOING TO BE SHOCKED BY
ANYTHING I READ HERE OR AM I
GOING TO BE INTRIGUED?
>> I THINK YOU'LL BE SHOCKED.
>> Stephen:  WHAT SHOCKS?
>> WELL, WHAT SHOCKS?
I GUESS THE SHOCK IS THE SIMPLE
FACT THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOUR
DIET IS WHETHER IT IS COOKED OUR
NOT.
>> Stephen:  FICOOK IT MYSELF
CAN I HAVE PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING?
>> YOU CAN HAVE THE PASTA.
MAYBE GET WHOLE WHEEPT PASTA IS
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen:  WHOLE WHEAT PASTA
SUCKS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
ON THAT NOTE, MICHAEL POLLAN,
THE BOOK IS "COOKED."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
