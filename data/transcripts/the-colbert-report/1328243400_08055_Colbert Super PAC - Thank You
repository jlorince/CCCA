THEY PICK SOMEBODY I LIKE.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, I HAVEN'T
MENTIONED THE MOST POWERFUL
SUPERPAC, COLBERT SUPERPAC.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT'S
GAUCHE TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE
MONEY YOU HAVE, SO I WILL
LET OTHER PEOPLE DO IT.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT STARTED
HIS OWN SUPERPAC.
HE PULLED DOWN A MILLION
BUCKS.
>> HE RAISED A MILLION
DOLLARS.
>> A MILLION DOLLARS.
>> $1 MILLION DOLLARS.
>> A MILLION DOLLARS, HERE.
>> $1 MILLION DOLLARS!
>> A MILLION DOLLARS WELL 1
MILLION.
>> $1 MILLION.
>> Stephen: YES, A MILLION
DOLLARS.
AND ONLY HALF OF IT WENT TO
PAYING FOR THOSE MOVIE
CLIPS.
FOLKS, IT ALL STARTED 11
MONTHS AGO RIGHT HERE.
YOU SEE, HI JUST SEEN THIS
AD FOR PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE TIM PAWLENTY.
NOW IF THAT NAME DOESN'T
RING A BELL, DON'T WORRY, IT
DIDN'T BACK THEN EITHER.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I'D
ALSO LIKE TO SPEND OTHER
PEOPLE'S MONEY ON SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.
WELL, WE'VE COME A LONG WAY
BECAUSE NOW WHEN YOU GOOGLE
SUPERPAC, COLBERT SUPERPAC
IS THE SECOND AND THIRD
RESULT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I, I DON'T WANT TO STOP
THERE.
I WANT THE GOOGLE
RECOGNITION OF A SANTORUM.
I WILL NOT BE SATISFIED
NUMBER SUPERPAC MEANS A
FROTHY MIX OF CAMPAIGN
FUNDING THAT IS SOMETIMES
THE BYPRODUCT OF POLITICS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OF COURSE, I GOT TO TAKE A
MOMENT HERE TO RECOGNIZE MY
CRACK SUPERPAC STAFF LED BY
CHIEF STRATEGIST AND HIGH
SODIUM LUNCH MEET SPAMRO
WHOSE WORK IN MY OPINION HAS
SO SURPASSED THAT OF HIS
HEAD SHAPED TWIN, THAT FROM
NOW ON MI OFFICIALLY CALLING
KARL ROVE HUMAN HAM ROVE.
BUT MOST OF ALL, FOLKS, I
GOT TO THANK THE 31,595 OF
YOU WHO DONATED DO COLE BERT
SUPERPAC.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU GAVE-- YOU FOLKS GAVE
UNTIL IT HURT.
AND EVIDENTLY, SOME OF YOU
HAVE VERY LOW THRESHOLD FOR
PAIN.
BECAUSE 1600 OF YOU GAVE $1
EACH.
GOD KNOWS WHAT THAT ADDS UP
TO.
NOW FOLKS, SINCE MONEY SPEAK,
I ALSO WANT TO CELEBRATE OUR
LOUDEST SPEAKER, ALEX RIG OP
OP-- OPULOS WHO DONATED
$9600.
ALEX, FOR BEING SO ELOQUENT
WITH YOUR CASH, I WILL BE
SENDING YOU THIS DELUXE
COLBERT SUPERPAC TOTE BAG.
IT IS ONE OF A KIND.
ONE OF A KIND BECAUSE MY
SHARPIE RAN OUT OF INC.
OF-- INK.
OF COURSE THERE IS ONE MORE
BIG QUESTION ABOUT COLBERT
SUPERPAC'S MILLION DOLLARS.
>> THE QUESTION IS WHERE
DOES IT GO NOW THAT HE NO
LONGER NEEDS IT.
>> GOOD QUESTION.
>> Stephen: WELL, YESTERDAY
FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED ITS IPO,
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
BUT I SLEPT LATE SO INSTEAD
I'M GOING TO PUT IT ALL INTO
THE NEXT BIG INTERNET
SENSATION, IT'S CALLED CAT
BREADING.
IT'S KIND OF COMPLEX.
PEOPLE UPLOAD PHOTOS OF
THEIR CAT'S FACE, PUSH
THROUGH A-- PUSHED THROUGH A
SLICE OF BREAD.
AND
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S IT.
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO
MONETIZE IT YET BUT THAT'S
WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT TWITTER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
