>> Stephen:  FOLKS, PLEASE,
FOLKS, PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO-- I
LOVE IT.
YOU LOVE IT.
BUT I HAVE GOT TO GET TO THE
BREAKING NEWS FROM 24 HOURS AGO.
( LAUGHTER )
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE
ARRESTED THREE ACCOMPLICED OF
ALLEGED BOSTON BOMBER JOKE-A-HAR
TSARNAEV.
THE ACCOMPLICES ARE TWO
KAZAKHSTANIS.
DIAS KA-HAD... KATY PERRY
AND AZA... HAZMAT TAZMANIAN
KAYAK.
( LAUGHTER )
DAMN YOU TERRORISTS!
WITH YOUR WEAPONNIZED
CONSONANTS.
WHY CAN'T YOU AREV REGULAR NAMES
LIKE RICK, OR ALAN OR AYMAN
AL-ZAWAHIRI.
FOLKS, THESE TWO, AND AN
AMERICANED NAMED ROBEL
PHILLIPOS, ARE FRIENDS OF
DZHOKAR TSARNAEV, WHO TEXTED HIM
AFTER THE F.B.I. RELEASED THE
PHOTOS OF THE BOMBERS.
>> INVESTIGATORS SAY ONE OF THE
ROOM MATES TEXTED DZHOKAR SAYING
HE LOOKS LIKE THE SUSPECT ON
TELEVISION.
DZHOKAR ALLEGEDLY RESPONDS,
L.O.L.
>> Stephen:  WHICH, I BELIEVE
PROVED HE'S A RADICAL ISLAMIST.
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW L.O.L. IS
SHORT FOR LULULULULULU.
( APPLAUSE )
.
( CHEERS )
NOW AFTER THAT THE THREE
SUSPECTS AWARE THAT THE FEDS
WERE SEEKING THEIR FRIEND FOR
BOMBING THE MARATHON, RACED TO
HIS APARTMENT AND URGENTLY
DECIDED TO WATCH A MOVIE.
( LAUGHTER )
ALTHOUGH, DURING INTERROGATION
THEY DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH ONE.
BUT IF IT WAS JOHN CARTER, THEY
CAN BE ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION
OF A BOMB.
THEN-- TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE.
THEN THEY DID SOMETHING THAT
THEY MIGHT LATER REGRET.
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT IT.
>> POLICE SAY KADYRBAYEV DECIDED
TO REMOVE THE BACKPACK FROM THE
ROOM IN ORDER TO HELP HIS
FRIEND.
>> THE BACKPACK WITH FIREWORKS
THAT HAD BEEN EMPTIED OF THEIR
POWDER AND A JAR OF VASELINE.
>> Stephen:  THEY HAD TO DITCH
THE BACKPACK BECAUSE THE
FIREWORKS WERE INCRIMINATING,
AND THE JAR OF VASELINE IS JUST
EMBARRASSING.
( LAUGHTER )
IN FACT, I WANT TO CHANGE MY
GUESS AS TO WHAT THE MOVIE WAS
THEY WERE WATCHING.
