HIS RENT AND FED HIS KIDS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I KNOW
WHERE ?EEL'S COMING FROM BECAUSE
WHEN I WAS YOUNG I HAD A
LOW-PAYING JOB LOSING TEETH FOR
A LIVING.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BUT WITH HARD WORK--
( APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WITH HARD WORK AND A LITTLE
DUMPSTER DIVING OUTSIDE A HOCKEY
RINK I TURNED IT INTO A
PROFITABLE BUSINESS, AND TODAY
YOU MAY KNOW THAT TOOTH LOSS
BUSINESS AS THE "COLBERT
REPORT."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT RIGHT IN
HERE.
I JUST WISH I KNEW WHO THAT
MAGICAL TOOTH FAIRY WAS SO I
COULD THANK FOR HER FOR MAKING
ME INDEPENDENT OF MY PARENTS.
PLEASE WELCOME THE HEAD OF THE
SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL
UNION MARY KAY HENRY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS
STRAIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE THESE
PEOPLE STRIKING?
THE PEOPLE IN FAST FOOD
SHOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE GETTING
RICH.
THEY'RE JUST TEENAGERS WORKING
PART-TIME JOBS.
>> 28-YEAR-OLD IS THE AVERAGE
AGE OF THESE JOBS.
THESE JOBS ARE NOW THE JOBS THAT
ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT
LOST GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS
BEFORE THE RECESSION, AND
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
AND ARE MAKING A DEMAND TO MAKE
THESE BAD, LOW-WAGE JOBS, GOOD
MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS SO WE CAN GET
THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN.
>> Stephen:  BUT WHY SHOULD
THIS CORPORATION HAVE TO PAY
THESE PEOPLE MORE THAN MINIMUM
WAGE?
ISN'T IT UP TO THESE PEOPLE TO
PULL THEMSELVES UP BY THEIR OWN
FRY BASKETS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> THESE CORPORATIONS ARE MAKING
MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.
>> Stephen:  YOU HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH THAT.
YOU UNION PEOPLE-- LET'S CALL A
SPADE A SPADE HERE.
I'M USING A BAD WORD HERE AND I
KNOW IT MIGHT OFFEND YOU, YOU'RE
IN A UNION.
YOU UNION PEOPLE HATE CAPITALISM
AND HATE BUSINESS.
>> WE'RE PROUD TO STAND WITH THE
FAST FOOD WORKERS ASKING
CORPORATIONS MAKING RECORD
PROFITS TO PAY THEM A LIVING
WAGE.
$5.5 BILLION IN PROFITS FROM
McDONALD'S JUST THIS PAST
YEAR.
AND WORKERS CAN'T-- ARE WORK
HARD AND CAN'T EVEN MAKE ENDS
MEET.
THAT'S WRONG.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, THEN GET A
DIFFERENT JOB.
>> THERE ARE NO OTHER JOBS TO
GET.
AND WE CANNOT HAVE A STRONG
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE UNITED
STATES IF WORKERS DON'T HAVE
MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS SO THEY
CAN BUY GOODS AND SERVICES SO
THOSE COMPANIES CAN HIRE MORE
PEOPLE AND WE CAN HAVE AN
ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY
IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT JUST THE
CORPORATIONS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  THESE PEOPLE ARE
CLEARLY ON MY SIDE BECAUSE YOU
SAID THE WORD "CORPORATIONS" AND
THEY STARTED CLAPPING.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU WANT THESE PEOPLE ORGANIZED
AND IN YOUR UNION.
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  YOU DON'T WANT
THEM.
SAY IT RIGHT NOW, "DON'T JOIN MY
UNION."
>> THE MEMBERS OF OUR UNION WANT
THESE WORKERS TO SUCCEED.
THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY
CAN TO MAKE SURE FAST FOOD
WORKERS GET $15 AN HOUR BECAUSE
IT WILL MEAN ALL THE WAGE CAN
RISE IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN.
>> Stephen:  WON'T THAT MEAN
THE SERVICE JOBS, THE GUY
FLIPPING THE BURGERS, AREN'T
THOSE JOBS GOING TO GO OVERSEAS?
( LAUGHTER )
I HAVE TO DRIVE MY CAR ALL THE
WAY ACROSS THE PACIFIC INTO GENG
GONG, TO GET A BURGER FROM A
CHINESE GUY.
>> A VERY LONG LUNCH BREAK.
>> Stephen:  YOU'VE HEARD FAST
FOOD CALLED A GUILTY PLEASURE,
RIGHT, OKAY?
PART OF THE GUILTY I FEEL IS
THAT I KNOW THEY'RE BEING
TREATED SO POORLY.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW, AND IF THAT GETS TAKEN
AWAY FROM ME, THE FOOD WILL LOSE
SOME OF ITS FLAVOR.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I WON'T FEEL AS NAUGHTY WHEN I
BUY IT IF I KNOW THEY'RE NOT
BEING OPPRESSED BY A
CORPORATION.
( LAUGHTER )
SAME REASON I LIKE VEAL.
I CAN TASTE THE SADNESS.
( APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW?
>> YEAH, I KNOW.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE WILLING TO
GIVE THAT JIEWP YES, I'M WILLING
TO GIVE THAT UP BECAUSE PEOPLE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK HARD, GET
BY AND GET AHEAD.
AND THAT'S THE PROMISE WE MADE
TO EVERY WORKENER THIS COUNTRY.
PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARD AND
BARELY GETTING BY, AND IT'S
WRONG.
AND THESE WORKERS ARE STANDING
UP FOR ALL OF US, AND THEY'RE
GOING TO MAKE THESE LOW-WAGE
JOBS GOOD JOBS, JUST LIKE AUTO
JOBS BECAME GOOD JOBS, SERVICE
JOBS CAN BECOME GOOD JOBS.
AND THANK GOD FOR THE FAST FOOD
WORKERS FOR STANDING UP AND
MAKING THAT HAPPEN.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU FOR
JOINING ME.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SERVICE
