WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, IT IS NO SECRET THAT THEAMERICAN PEOPLE TUNE IN TO THE
REPORT EVERY NIGHT TO KNOW HOWTO FEEL ABOUT AMERICA.
WELL, TONIGHT, PREHEAT YOURSELFTO OUTRAGED-- ALTHOUGH, IF
YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU ONLY HAVETHREE SETTINGS:  ANGRY,
OUTRAGED, AND POPCORN.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I AM STILL STINGING FROMLAST WEEK'S RELIGIOUS LIBERTY
CURB-STOMP BY ARIZONA GOVERNORAND LAST PERSON TO SEE HANSEL
AND GRETEL ALIVE, JAN BREWER.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
GOVERNOR BREWER VETOED SB-1062,WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED
BUSINESS OWNERS TO FREELYPRACTICE THEIR DEEPLY HELD
RELIGIOUS BELIEF OF NOT SELLINGPASTRY TO GAY PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )BECAUSE GOD IS MY CAKE BOSS.
BUT, OF COURSE, THE GAY-STREAMMEDIA TWISTED THE BILL INTO
SOMETHING UGLY.
>> I'M A RELIGIOUS PERSON.
THIS IS NOT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
IT'S JUST PLAIN BIGOTRY.
>> THIS IS A BIGOTRY BILL MASKEDUNDER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
>> THEY'RE QUOTING BIGOTRY, PERSE, IN THE NAME OF GOD.
IT'S JIM CROWE BACK FROM THEDEAD.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY SIMILARARGUMENT THAT WAS RAISED AGAINST
THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS OF THEMID-60s.
>> Reporter:>> Stephen:  THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLESOF THE 1960s.
FOR STARTERS, WHEN GAY MARCHERSGET HIT WITH A FIREHOSE, THEY
LOVE IT!
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S AN ACTUAL PHOTO, WHICHMEANS I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.
THE POINT IS GAY MARRIAGE IS NOTA CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.
JUST ASK IOWA REPUBLICAN ANDVOLUNTEER THE HYPNOTISTS FORGOT
TO WAKE UP, STEVE KING.
JIM?
>> IT'S CLEAR IN THE CIVILRIGHTS SECTION OF THE CODE
THAT-- THAT YOU CAN'TDISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE
BASED UPON-- I'M NOT SURE I'VEGOT THE LIST RIGHT-- RACE,
CREED, RELIGION, COLOR OF SKIN,THOSE KIND OF THINGS.
AND THERE'S NOTHING MENTIONED INTHERE ON SELF-PROFESSED
BEHAVIOR, AND THAT'S WHATTHEY'RE TRYING TO PERFECT IS
SPECIAL RIGHTS FORSELF-PROFESSED BEHAVIOR.
>> Stephen:  YES,SELF-PROFESSED BEHAVIOR.
UNLIKE RACE, YOU CAN'T TELLSOMEBODY'S GAY JUST BY LOOKING
AT THEM. AS FAR ASI KNOW, JOHNNY WEIR IS A
PERFECTLY STRAIGHT WOOD NYMPH.
YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHAT EXACTLYDOES "SELF-PROFESSED" MEAN?
>> THE THING I REFERENCE WHEN ISAY SELF-PROFESSED.
WHO DO YOU DISCRIMINATE AGAINST?
ARE THEY SETTING UP A CASE?
IS THIS ABOUT BRINGING AGRIEVANCE OR A SERVICE THEY'D
LIKE TO HAVE.
>> Stephen:  STEVE KING ISRIGHT.
THESE SELF-PROFESSED GAYS JUSTWANT YOU TO REFUSE THEM SERVICE
SO THEY CAN SUE YOU.
WE'VE SEEN IT A MILLION TIMESA GUY PRETENDS TO BE GAY,
PRETEND TO HIDE IT TIL HE'S 18,THEN HE PRENTENDS TO COME OUT
TO HIS FAMILY WHO PRETEND NOTTO KNOW AND PRETEND TO SHUN HIM.
HE MOVES TO THE CITY A FEW YEARSLATER, HE MEETS ANOTHER GUY WHO
PRENTENDS TO BE GAY, THEYPRETEND TO FALL IN LOVE AND
HE PRETENDS TOPROPOSE AND THEY GET FAKE
ENGAGED.
THE MAN REACHED OUT TO HISFAMILY, AND THEY PRETEND TO GROW
A LOT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEENWATCHING A LOT OF "MODERN
FAMILY."
THEY DON'T PRETEND TO PRETEND TOUNDERSTAND HIS LIFE, BUT THEY
CAN SEE HOW HAPPY HE PRETENDSTO BE, AND THEY GIVE THEIR
PRETEND BLESSING.
THE PRETEND COUPLE ENTERS AFLOWER SHOP. ONE
PRETENDS TO WANT ORCHIDS. THEOTHER PRETENDS TO WANT
HYDRANGEA. BUT ONCE THEY'REIN THE STORE THEY PRETEND
TO LOVE THE DELICATE VIBRANCE OFPERUVIAN LILYS.
THEY APPROACH THE OWNER WHOSAYS, "I CAN'T SELL TO YOU.
I'M A CHRISTIAN."
AND BOOM, THEY SUE HIM, RUN OFFTO VEGAS, AND PRETEND TO HAVE
SEX WITH A LADY HOOKER AS GODPRETENDED.
GOTCHA!
EXWOCHA!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YEAH, LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT, LIKE
THAT.
AND AS STEVE KING KNOWS, EVENIF GAYS DO EXIST, IT'S NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE IT.
>> IF IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLYPROTECTED IN THE CONSTITUTION,
THEN IT'S-- IT GOT TO BE ANIMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTIC, THAT
BEING A CHARACTERISTIC THAT CANBE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED AND
CAN'T BE WILLFULLY CHANGED.
YES, THE ONLY WAY FOR GAYS TO BEPROTECTED IS TO HAVE THEIR
GAYNESS INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED.
I THINK WHAT STEVE KING ISSAYING, GAYS, IS HE WANTS YOU TO
SEND PHOTOS AND/OR VIDEOSPROVING TO STEVE KING THAT YOU
ARE GAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AGAIN, THAT'S STEVE KING,2210 RAYBURN OFFICE BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, D.C., 20515.
BE SURE TO LABEL YOUR ENVELOPE"CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION."
SO YOU KNOW THAT HE'LL READ IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
