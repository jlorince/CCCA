( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  TELL YOU, WHAT,
FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
FOLKES, I HAD NOT PLANNED ON
THIS, BUT SINCE YOU JUST CHEERED
MY NAME, LET'S DO A GOOD SHOW.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
NATION, I KNOW IN SHAKY
FINANCIAL TIMES, PEOPLE LOOK TO
ME FOR GUIDANCE.
( LAUGHTER )
THEY LOOK AT ME FOR PLEASURE,
BUT TO ME FOR GUIDANCE.
SO I JUST WANT TO START TONIGHT
BY REASSURING INVESTORS AND
CALMING THE MARKETS.
FOR STARTERS, EVERYBODY CLOSE
YOUR EYES, TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
AND JUST PRETEND THERE IS NO
PLACE CALLED GREECE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!
SECOND, I WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE
OF YOU WHO ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE
SWISS FINANCIAL GIANT
UBS REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT THEY
LOST OVER $2 BILLION FROM ROGUE
TRADES.
NOW, WHILE THAT MAY SOUND LIKE A
LOT, KEEP IN MIND IT'S A
FRACTION OF THE $17 BILLION THEY
LOST THROUGH AUTHORIZED TRADES
( LAUGHTER )
SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.
OKAY, THEY'RE PULLING IT OUT OF
THEIR ( BLEEP ).
MOST IMPORTANTLY, UBS STATED,
"NO CLIENT MONEY WAS INVOLVED."
OKAY?
SO IF YOU'RE WITH UBS, IT WASN'T
YOUR .
IT WAS JUST LAYING AROUND, YOU
BE.
MAYBE-- MAYBE IN THE BANKS, TAKE
A BILLION-LEAVE A BILLION TRADE.
AND WHILE THIS ROGUE TRADER WAS
DOING THIS FROM A COMPUTER
TERMINAL, I AM SURE UBS PROTECTS
ACCESS TO YOUR RETIREMENT
ACCOUNT WITH AN UNCRACKABLE
PASSWORD LIKE UBS PASS WORD.
OR UBSPASSWORD 1.
HOW COULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPEN?
I ASK THE TELEVISION.
>> WHAT COULD BE THE MOTIVE?
MAYBE INTENTIONAL FRAUD.
IT COULD BE BASIC STUPIDITY, OR
IT COULD BE KNOWN AS FAST
FINGERS.
MAYBE THE TRADER HIT A WRONG
BUTTON.
>> Stephen:  I CAN SYMPATHIZE
ARE THAT.
OTHER DAY I MEANT TO DIAL 411,
BUT INSTEAD I LOST $2 BILLION.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
NOW THE GOOD NEWS, IT CAN HAPPEN
TO ANYBODY.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE GOOD NEWS
IS THEY'VE ALREADY ARRESTED THE
ROGUE TRADER, 31-YEAR-OLD QUAKEO
ABDUBOLE, SEEN HERE SAFELY
CONTAINED IN A CALVIN KLEIN AD.
FOLKES, AS SCARED AS WE ALL
MIGHT BE FOR OUR SAVINGS I WANT
TO POINT OUT THE REAL VICTIM
HERE-- UBS.
THEY'VE ANNOUNCED THIS INCIDENT
WILL RESULT IN A NET LOSS FOR
THE THIRD QUARTER.
BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT UBS WILL
EARN BACK EVERY DOLLAR WAY BANKS
ALWAYS DO-- BY ROLLING
