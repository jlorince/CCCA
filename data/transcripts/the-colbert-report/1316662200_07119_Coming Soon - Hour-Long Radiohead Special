>> STEPHEN: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT," EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, YOU MAY
REMEMBER, AFTER I LAUNCHED MY
SUMMER CONCERT SERIES, STEVE
FEST '11 BACK IN JUNE, EVERYBODY
SAID THERE WAS NO WAY MY SHOW
COULD GET ANY MORE DIGITAL TO
THE POWER OF 23 SKIDOO.
WELL, BE PREPARED TO EAT THOSE
WORDS ANYONE WHO SAID THOSE
WORDS BECAUSE NEXT MONDAY,
SEPTEMBER 26TH, I WILL BE
DOING AN EXCLUSIVE SPECIAL
BROADCAST WITH ROCK LEGENDS THE
RADIOHEADS.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT?
WHAT?
RADIOHEAD?
OKAY.
EVIDENTLY ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL
BE COMING.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, HIPSTERS, I WILL GIVE
YOU A SECOND TO MOP UP YOUR
BLOWN MINDS BECAUSE THERE WILL
BE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCES,
INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND, AND
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE
YEARS, MY STAFF WILL STICK
AROUND.
THEY'LL WATCH THE TAPING.
THE WHOLE NIGHT WILL BE
SPONSORED BY THE FIRST NAME IN
INDY CRED, DR. PEPPER.
LONG HISTORY WITH ROCK MUSIC FOR
DR. PEPPER.
OF COURSE, HE STARTED OUT AS
SERGEANT PEPPER BEFORE
EVENTUALLY EARNING HIS Ph.D.
IN FLAVORROLOGY.
SO HIPSTER NATION, BE SURE TO
TUNE IN MONDAY NIGHT.
IT WILL BE OUR FIRST-EVER
HOUR-LONG EPISODE OF "THE
REPORT," AND SIGNS IT'S TWICE AS
LONG, I WILL, OF COURSE, BE PAID
TWICE AS MUCH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING TOLD I WILL BE PAID
THE SAME AMOUNT.
THEN IT
