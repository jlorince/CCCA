>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT, SAYING
THAT PLAGUE VIDEO GAMES CAN
TEACH US VALUABLE LIFE
LESSONS.
TAUGHT ME TO DRIVE OVER
HOOKERS.
PLEASE WELCOME JANE
McGONIGAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW MISMcGONIGAL,
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED
"REALITY IS BROKEN.
WHY GAMES MAKE US BETTER AND
HOW THEY CAN CHANGE THE
WORLD"
OKAY.
FIRST QUESTION, IT IS AN
OBVIOUS ONE.
YOU'RE A GAMER, CORRECT.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE ALSO
A GIRL.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, AND A PRETTY ONE AT
THAT, WITH THE BIG HAIR AND
EVERYTHING.
IF I TURN OFF THE SWITCH, DO
YOU TURN OUT TO BE JUST A
15-YEAR-OLD BOY IN HIS
UNDERWEAR?
IS THIS AN AVATAR.
>> NOT AN AVATAR T THIS IS
ME.
40% OF GAMERS ARE WOMEN.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> UH-HUH, AND 94%-- 94% OF
GIRLS UNDER 18 PLAY GAMES.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> SO IN THE FUTURE WE'LL
ALL BE GAMERS.
>> Stephen: IS THAT WHY
REALITY IS BROKEN BECAUSE
OUR-- OUR KIDS ARE ALL ON
THE FUN BOX.
>> NO, YOU KNOW, IT'S
ACTUALLY THERE IS THIS BIG
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT GAMES
THAT THEY ARE A WASTE OF
TIME.
BUT TEN YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH SHOW THAT PLAYING
GAMES IS ACTUALLY THE MOST
PRODUCTIVE THING WE CAN DO.
MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN MOST OF
WHAT WE SPEND DOING IN WORK
OR AT SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: SO IT DOESN'T
JUST LEAD TO A PEAR SHAPE
AND CHEETOH STAINED FINGERS.
BUT HOW IS IT PRODUCTIVE.
YOU CLAIM, HOW MANY HOURS
DOES THE WORLD GAME EVERY
WEEK RIGHT NOW.
>> 3 BILLION HOURS.
>> Stephen: SO COLLECTIVELY
3 BILLION HOURS OF GAMING.
AND YOU SAY TO MAKE THE
WORLD A BETTER PLACE, YOU
WANT TO GET US TO HOW MANY
HOURS OF GAME.
>> 21 BILLION A WEEK.
>> Stephen: 21 BILLION HOURS
A WEEK.
HOW DO YOU GO FROM 3 TO 21
BILLION HOURS OTHER THAN
LEGALIZE MARIJUANA?
>> RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 500
MILLION GAMERS ON THE
PLANET.
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO GET
TO 3 BILLION GAMERS.
AND THEN WE SHOULD SPEND AN
HOUR A DAY PLAYING GAMES.
THAT WOULD BE 21 BILLION.
>> Stephen: WHY DON'T MORE
CHILDREN IN SOUTH SAHARAN
AFRICA PLAY, WHY AREN'T WE
SENDING THEM --
>> WE'RE WORKING ON IT.
TO GET THE-- .
>> Stephen: WE ARE GOING TO
GET STARVING CHIRNING GAMING
CONSOLES IS BONO WORKING ON
THIS.
>> I MADE A GAME FOR SAR
ANNAFTER QA, CALLED THE
SOCIETY.
>> Stephen: WE MADE A GAME.
>> HOW TO START THEIR OWN
SOCIAL ENTERPRISES, HELP
SOLVE PROBLEMS LIKE POVERTY
AND HUNGER.
>> Stephen: SO YOU CREATE
GAMES THAT HAVE AN EFFECT IN
THE REAL WORLD.
>> I KNOW AMAZING, WE DO
THAT, THERE ARE LOTS OF
PEOPLE DOING THAT.
>> Stephen: BUT HOW DO YOU
GAME-- THERE IS GAMING AND
THEN THERE IS THE REAL
WORLD.
THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS.
>> THEY ARE, BUT-- .
>> Stephen: WE GAME TO GET
AWAY FROM THE REAL WORLD.
>> YES, THAT'S ANOTHER
MISCONCEPTION.
SO ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING
WHEN WE ARE PLAYING GAMES IS
WE ARE TAPPING INTO OUR BEST
QUALITIES.
OUR ABILITY TO BE MOTIVATED,
TO BE OPTIMISTIC, TO
COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS, TO
BE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF
FAILURE.
>> Stephen: IT IS ABOUT
ESCAPISM.
IT IS, LISTEN, I CAN SHOW
YOU ONE PHOTO OF ME IN 7th
GRADE AND WILL YOU KNOW WHY
I PLAYED DUFERJONS AND
DRAGONS.
OKAY.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT THEN, OKAY,
IF WE ARE BEST SELFS IN
GAMING BUT THAT'S IN THE
GAME WORLD.
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT WHO WE
ARE IN THE REAL WORLD?
BACK IN THE REAL WORLD,
THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES.
>> SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
EMOTIONS WE FEEL IN GAMES,
SPILL OVER INTO OUR LEGAL
LIVES.
SO PLAYING A GAME WITH A
POWERFUL AVATAR FOR JUST 930
SECONDS WILL CHANGE HOW
CONFIDENT YOU ARE.
FOR 24 HOURS.
ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO DO
WELL IN A WORKPLACE MEETING.
TAKING A TEST AND EVEN
FLIRTING WITH STRANGERS AT A
BAR.
WILL YOU FLIRT WITH SOMEONE
MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN WOULD
YOU HAVE IF YOU HADN'T
PLAYED A GAME.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO WHEN I AM NOT
GAMING, I AM TIMID.
BUT AFTER I'VE GAMED, THEN I
SEE A PRETTY GIRL, I CAN
PRETEND LIKE I'VE GOT A
THUNDER CANNON.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT IS THE
FUTURE.
WHAT'S NEXT?
HOW DO YOU MOVE ON TO
REALITY WITH GAMES.
>> THE FIRST THING WE DO IS
HELP GAMERS UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON IN
THE REAL WORLD WHO THEY ARE
WHEN THEY PLAY GAMES.
THEY CAN BE THAT HEROIC.
THEY CAN BE THAT RESILIENT
IN THE FACE OF FAILURE.
AND THEN WE START MAKING
GAMES THAT CONNECT THEM TO
REAL WORLD PROBLEMS.
THERE ARE ACTUALLY GAMES YOU
CAN PLAY NOW TO HELP YOU END
POVERTY, AND STOP CLIMATE
CHANGE AND CURE CANSER.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THERE ARE, UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: DO THEY WORK?
>> SO SO FAR THIS YEAR,
57,000 GAMERS CO-AUTHORED A
PAPER FOR NATURE JOURNALS.
THE PROCEDURE SCIENTIFIC
JOURNAL DIDN'T HAVE ANY
TRAINING IN BIOCHEMISTRY AT
ALL.
BUT THEY PLAYED A GAME THAT
HELPED THEM CO-AUTHOR A
PAPER.
>> Stephen: BUT IF WE-- BUT
IF YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT
GAMES HAVE A SOCIAL FUNCTION
AND THAT BY PLAYING THEM YOU
CAN MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER
PLACE, WE'LL NEVER STOP OUR
KIDS FROM PLAYING.
THEY'LL SAY JUST FIVE MORE
MINUTES, DAD, I'VE ALMOST
CURED CANCER.
>> THAT WOULD BE AN EPIC
WIN.
>> Stephen: IT WOULD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
JANE
