I ONLY BRING THIS UP BECAUSE IBELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM.
WHEN MY GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHERBRAVED THE ATLANTIC CROSSING, HE
CAME HERE WITH THE HOPE HIS NEWCOUNTRY WOULD NEVER BE RUINED BY
A BUNCH OF FILTHY IMMIGRANTS.
SADLY ONCE AGAIN AMERICA ISAWASH IN UNWASHED MASSES.
THIS TIME THEY'RE POURING ACROSSTHE LONG, SKINNY OCEAN TO OUR
SOUTH, THE RIO GRANDE.
>> IN THE SOUTHWEST, A DEEPENINGCRISIS TONIGHT INVOLVING
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN FROMCENTRAL AMERICA WHO HAVE BEEN
CROSSING INTO THIS COUNTRYALONE.
>> MANY WERE HOPING TO MEET UPWITH PARENTS AFTER FLEEING
VIOLENCE, POVERTY AND GANGS.
>> PACKED INTO HOLDING CELLS,SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR WITH THESE
THERMAL BLANKETS, THERE'S NOTENOUGH FOOD, NOT ENOUGH BEDS,
NOT ENOUGH BATHROOMS.
>> SO SAD TO SEE THOSE KIDS INTHEIR TINFOIL POUCHES, NOT EVEN
A CLOVE OF GARLIC TO SEASONTHEM.
AND THE NUMBERS, THE NUMBERS,FOLKS, ARE SHOCKING.
SO FAR MORE THAN 47,000 MIGRANTKIDS HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY
AND HAVE BEEN CAUGHT SINCEOCTOBER 1st.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.
IF YOU STACK 47,000 KIDSEND-TO-END, YOU COULD PROBABLY
GET A JOB IN THAT HOLDINGFACILITY.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLYTOUGH SITUATION FOR THE
EMPLOYEES.
>> THE CHILDREN ACTUALLYREJECTED THEIR BREAKFAST
BURRITOS BECAUSE THEY WERE MADEOF FLOUR TORTILLAS AND PEOPLE
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEYACTUALLY EAT CORN TORTILLAS
>> Stephen: DO YOU EXPECT METO BELIEVE THAT NOT ALL
HISPANICS EAT FLOUR TORTILLAS?
NEXT YOU'LL TELL ME MEXICANSDON'T EAT WAFFLE TACOS.
AND WAIT, WAIT, FOLKS.
WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR WHAT THEYCLAIM IS THE REASON THAT ALL
THIS IS HAPPENING.
>> THEY'RE PRIMARILY FROM THREECENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES,
HONDURAS, GUATEMALA AND ELSALVADOR.
>> THE RUMOR IS OUT ACROSSCENTRAL AMERICA ABOUT THESE
SO-CALLED "PERMISOS," PERMISSIONTO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES.
SOMEBODY SAID THEY ARE GIVINGPERMITS FOR PEOPLE TO STAY HERE.
>> THE RUMOR MILL IN THE CENTRALAMERICAN COUNTRIES IS SAYING
THAT ONCE YOU GET HERE, IFYOU'RE AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR,
YOU CAN STAY.
>> Stephen: PARENTS ARE JUSTDROPPING KIDS OFF AND THEN
DISAPPEARING?
PLEASE, TEXAS IS NOT THE BALLPIT AT IKEA.
AND I DON'T BUY IT, FOLKS.
I DON'T BUY IT.
AND DON'T YOU BUY IT EITHER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]SINCE THAT EXPLANATION, HOWEVER
TRAGIC IT MAY BE, THIS LEAVESTOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TOUNANSWER THEM THAN I IN STEPHEN
COLBERT'S "BAT [BLEEPED]SERIOUS."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]FOLKS, LONG-TIME VIEWERS KNOW
THAT IN "BAT [BLEEPED] SERIOUS,"I PEEL BACK THE VEIL TO EXPOSE
HIDDEN TRUTHS THEY DON'T WANTYOU TO KNOW.
FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW THEFLUORIDE THE GOVERNMENT PUTS IN
OUR WATER ISN'T EVEN TO CONTROLOUR MINDS?
IT'S TO STRENGTHEN OUR TEETH.
THAT WAY WE WON'T GET FILLINGSAND THE REBEL UNDERGROUND CAN'T
BROADCAST TRUTH DIRECTLY INTOOUR SKULLS.
[LAUGHTER]NOW, FOLKS, THESE KIDS SAY
THEY'RE COMING HERE TO ESCAPEPOVERTY AND VIOLENCE, BUT MY
CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES AND IKNOW THAT THE MORE LIKELY
EXPLANATION IS THE ONE WE LIKEMORE.
JUST FOLLOW TEXAS GOVERNOR RICKPERRY AS HE PUTS HIS HEAD UP HIS
OWN RABBIT HOLE.
THEY EITHER HAVE AN INCREDIBLYINEPT ADMINISTRATION OR THEY'RE
IN ON THIS SOMEHOW OR OTHER.
I HATE TO BE CONSPIRATORIAL, BUTHOW DO YOU MOVE THAT MANY PEOPLE
FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ACROSSMEXICO AND THEN INTO THE UNITED
STATES WITHOUT THEIR BEING AFAIRLY COORDINATED EFFORT.
>> I HATE TO BE CONSPIRATORIAL,TOO
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
THOUSANDS OF KIDS STREAMING UPFROM CENTRAL AMERICA ACROSS OUR
BORDER.
OBAMA.
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
OKAY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NEED MORE PROOF?
I'M OUT.
BUT WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR TUCKERCARLSON?
>> CAN WE BE HONEST AND SAY THATTHERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN OFFICE,
I WOULD EVEN SAY IN THE WHITEHOUSE, WHO LOOK AT IMMIGRANTS
LIKE THIS COMING HERE ILLEGALLYAS POTENTIAL VOTERS, THAT THIS
DOES CHANGE THE ELECTORALBALANCE OF THE COUNTRY AND MAYBE
THEY SEE THIS AS A GOOD THING.
>> Stephen: YES.
OBAMA'S ORGANIZING BUS TRIPSFROM TEGUCIGALPA SO THESE KIDS
CAN GROW UP IN AMERICA ANDBECOME CITIZENS THROUGH SOME
FUTURE SOMEHOW PASSABLEIMMIGRATION BILL, ALL SO THEY
CAN VOTE AND DELIVER OBAMA HISFIFTH TERM IN 2024.
IT COULD HAPPEN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WRITE THAT DOWN.
