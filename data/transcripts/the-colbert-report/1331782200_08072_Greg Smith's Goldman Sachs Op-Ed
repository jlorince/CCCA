[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THESE
PEOPLE ARE NOT FOLLOWING AROUND.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU PEOPLE HAVE THE SPIRIT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, FOR ANYBODY WHO LIVES
AND WORKS IN NEW YORK, YOU KNOW
THAT WALL STREET IS THE FINANCE
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
AND WHEN YOU WORK ON THE STREET,
THERE'S A SACRED TRUST.
YOU NEVER GO PUBLIC WITH
COMPLAINTS ABOUT YOUR BOSSES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND IN EXCHANGE ONE DAY THEY'LL
EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT IT IS YOU DO
FOR A LIVING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M DISGUSTED TO LEARN ABOUT
THIS OP-ED IN TODAY'S "NEW YORK
TIMES" BUT GREG SMITH ENTITLED
WHY I AM LEAVING GOLDMAN SACHS
IN WHICH HE REVEALED TO BECOME A
LEADER YOU MUST PER SQUAD YOUR
CLIENTS IN THE STOCKS YOU ARE
TRYING TO GET RID OF BECAUSE
THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS HAVING A
LOT OF POTENTIAL PROFIT AND NOT
ONE SINGLE MINUTE IS SPENT
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW
GOLDMAN CAN HELP CLIENTS.
OF COURSE, TIME IS MONEY.
THEY DON'T WANT TO WASTE CLIENTS
MONEY BY SPENDING TIME THINKING
ABOUT THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS BANKER-DICT ARNOLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN HAD THE GALL TO ATTACK MY
FRIEND LLOYD BECAUSE HE SAID
GOLDMAN SACHS IS DOING GOD'S
WORK.
IT IS.
HE JUST DIDN'T SAY WHICH GOD.
MAYBE IT WAS THE LORD OF
DESTRUCTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THE GREATEST BETRAYAL OF ALL
OF THE REVELATION THAT GOLDMAN
SACHS DERISIVELY CALLED THEIR
OVERLY TRUSTING CLIENTS MUP
EVES.
THAT'S -- MUPPETS.
THAT'S AK RIT.
SOME WERE MUPPETS AND
UNFORTUNATELY ERNIE TOOK A REAL
BATH.
I MAY NOT AGREE WITH THIS GUY
BUT I HAVE TO SLEUTH HIS
PRINCIPLES.
ONCE HE FOUND OUT THAT GOLDMAN
HAD A CULT TOUGHER GREED HE LEFT
IMMEDIATELY AFTER 12 YEARS AT
THE FIRM.
I DOUBT HE WILL HAVE ANY TROUBLE
FINDING A NEW JOB BECAUSE HE
TACKED HIS RESUME ON TO THE
ARTICLE.
HE WON A BRNS MEDAL FOR TABLE
TENNIS AT THE MACABEA GAMES ALSO
KNOWN AS THE JEWISH OLYMPICS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS GUY GETS TO JUMP TO THE
FRONT OF THE LINE BY ANNOUNCING
I'M THE THIRD BEST JEWISH PING
PONG÷ú PLAYER ON EARTH?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WAY TO REINFORCE THE HATEFUL
