>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY GUEST
TONIGHT HAS A NOBEL PRIZE.
BIG DEAL.
ALL MY GUESTS DO.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME AL GORE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT AN HONOR TO FINALLY HAVE
YOU NEAR WITHER UNDERNEATH THE
GLARE OF MY SCORN.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, SIR, LET'S GET SOME
POLITICS OUT OF THE WAY FIRST,
MAY WE?
>> OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
RICK PERRY ENDORSED YOU IN 1988.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WILL YOU RETURN THE
FAVOR?
(LAUGHTER)
RIGHT NOW AND ENDORSE RICK
PERRY.
>> WELL, IT WOULD HURT HIM A
LOT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IS THAT AN
ENDORSEMENT.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
>> Stephen: SO BECAUSE AN
ENDORSEMENT WOULD HURT HIM AND
YOU WON'T ENDORSE HIM ISN'T THAT
IN ITSELF AN ENDORSEMENT?
>> UM... YOU COULD PUT IT THAT
WAY.
>> Stephen: I JUST DID.
>> YES!
HE WAS A DEMOCRAT BACK THEN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: WEREN'T WE ALL.
(LAUGHTER)
I'VE GOT A LITTLE FOLLOW-UP,
RICK PERRY QUESTION FOR YOU.
RICK PERRY SAID IN ONE OF THE
RECENT DEBATES, HE SAID OF
GLOBAL WARMING, HE SAID "BACK IN
THE 17th CENTURY, ONLY GALILEO
SAID EARTH REVOLVED AROUND THE
SUN, EVERYBODY ELSE SAID THE SUN
RESOLVED AROUND THE EARTH."
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
GALILEO OR GLOBAL WARMING?
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE RICK PERRY SAYS YOU
CAN'T HAVE BOTH.
THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN YET, IS IT?
>> WELL, IT IS IN AND....
>> Stephen: I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
>> STEPHEN, THE EARTH DOES GO
AROUND THE SUN.
LOOK OUTSIDE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT THE SCIENCE ON
GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT IN YET.
>> WELL, IT IS.
EVERY NATIONAL ACADEMY OF
SCIENCE, EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD AGREES AND THE
NATIONAL ACADEMY....
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE NATIONAL
ACADEMIES.
THOSE ARE GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS
WHO ARE ON THE GOVERNMENT DOLE,
WE KNOW GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO
ANYTHING.
>> EVERY PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIFIC
SOCIETY IN EVERY FIELD RELATED
TO THE STUDY OF CLIMATE ENDORSES
IT.
97% TO 98% OF ALL THE CLIMATE
SCIENTISTS THAT ARE MOST ACTIVE
PUBLISHING IN THE FIELD AGREE
WITH IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BUT THAT SAYS
THERE IS GLOBAL WARMING.
I'LL ACCEPT THERE IS GLOBAL
WARMING.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOUR MOVIE
MADE MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN.
THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN.
WE GET EACH OTHER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT THAT'S... I'VE GOT SAY THAT
IS VERY 2007 THINKING.
BECAUSE THAT WAS A LUXURY TO
CARE.
>> IT'S GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THEN.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BUT SO HAS
EVERYTHING ELSE.
YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE A GUY WHO'S DOWN IN MY
BASEMENT SAYING HEY, YOU'VE GOT
A BROKEN FOUNDATION IN YOUR
HOUSE AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT
MY SECOND FLOOR'S ON FIRE.
THAT'S THE ECONOMY IN THIS
METAPHOR.
AND I HAVE TO PUT OUT THE
ECONOMY FIRE BEFORE I WORK WITH
YOUR FOUNDATION GLOBAL WARMING.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THIS TOO TECHNICAL?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M HORRIBLE AT THIS
SOPHISTICATION OF YOUR METAPHOR.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHERE'S MY NOBEL PRIZE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S GOT SO MUCH GOING ON IT
IN.
>>.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.
OUR FOCUS IS ON, LIKE, EVERYDAY
NEEDS.
>> WELL, ONE OF THE REASONS IS
ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE IS BECAUSE
WE KEEP GOING TO WAR IN THE
MIDDLE EAST IN THE PLACE WHERE
MOST OF THE OIL IS LOCATED AND
WE KEEP BORROWING MONEY FROM
CHINA TO BUY OIL FROM A MARKET
DOMINATED BY SAUDI ARABIA AND
THEN BURN IN THE WAYS THAT
DESTROY THE FUTURE OF THE
PLANET.
ALL OF THAT'S GOT TO CHANGE.
WE CAN PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND
STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY BY
BUILDING SOLAR AND WIND
FACILITIES, REFURBISHING
INEFFICIENT BUILDINGS, BUILDING
SMART GRIDS AND FAST TRAINS AND
PUTTING PEOPLE WORK INSTEAD OF
CONTINUING THIS ADDICTION TO
VERY EXPENSIVE DIRTY OIL AND
COAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT WAS VERY WELL
SAID.
SIR, THAT WAS VERY WELL SAID BUT
I SUSPECT THOSE ARE THE FIRST
100 WORDS YOU SAY EVERY MORNING.
