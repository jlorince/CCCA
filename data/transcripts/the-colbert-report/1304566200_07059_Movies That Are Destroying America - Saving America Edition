>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, IT'S NO SECRET,
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
I DON'T LIKE HOLLYWOOD.
IT'S FULL OF PHONIES BLOWING
SMOKE  UP YOUR ASS TELLING YOU
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS GREAT.
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO LIVE SO FAR
AWAY?
[LAUGHTER]
SOME MOVIES HAVE A POSITIVE
IMPACT WHICH IS TIME -- WHY IT'S
TIME FOR A SPECIAL MOVIES THAT
ARE DESTROYING AMERICA!
♪ ♪
SAVING AMERICA EDITION.
FOLKS, THERE'S NO MORE U.S.A.
FRIENDLY MOVIE THIS SUMMER THAN
CAPTAIN AMERICA.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
POFY EVER SINCE I RECEIVED --
MOVIE EVER SINCE I RECEIVED CAPS
OFFICIAL SHIELD FROM MARVEL BACK
IN 2007.
IT HANGS PROUDLY IN MY STUDIO.
IT REPRESENTS TRUTH, JUSTICE AND
COVERING UP A WHOLE WHERE I
MISSED WITH THE HAMMER.
[LAUGHTER]
CAPTAIN AMERICA NEVER GIVES UP,
FOLKS.
WORLD WAR II AND IT'S 60 YEARS
AGO AND THE GUY IS STILL
FIGHTING THE NAZIS.
JIM?
>> ROGER, STEPHEN.
>> GIVE ME A CHANCE.
>> SORRY, SON.
>> SAVING YOUR LIFE.
>> THE ARMY BEGINS WITH ONE MAN.
>> I CAN OFFER YOU A CHANCE.
>> HE WILL BE THE FIRST IN A NEW
BREED OF SUPERSOLDIER.
>> IT'S FOR ADOLF HITLER.
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HELL.
[GUN FIRE]
>> Stephen: THAT IS AN ALL
AMERICAN MESSAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU ARE A SKINNY KID WHO
WANTS TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY, GET
JACKED UP ON STEROIDS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH.
THAT SHOWS REAL BALLS.
ALTHOUGH NOT YOUR BALLS BECAUSE
THEY'LL BE THE SIZE OF RAISE --
RAISINETTES.
IMAGINE THE MERCHANDISING
POSSIBILITIES.
WHO WOULDN'T WAND TO OPEN A KIDS
MEAL TO FIND A CAPTAIN AMERICA
BRAND HYPE DETERMINIC NEEDLE.
COLLECT ALL EIGHT VIOLENT MOOD
SWINGS.
THIS PROVES WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS
SAID WE WOULD HAVE BEATEN THE
NAZIS SOONER IF WE HAD DONE
HUMAN EXPERIMENT TO CREATE
SOME -- I DON'T KNOW -- MASTER
RACE.
THINK HOW BAD ASS OUR NAVY SEALS
WOULD BE IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY
PART SALES.
THE NEXT MOVIE IS "ATLAS SHRUG"
ON THE NOVEL BY AYN RAND WHOSE
PHILOSOPHY STATES THAT THE
PURPOSE OF LIFE IS PURSUING YOUR
OWN HAPPINESS WITH NO REGARD FOR
OTHERS.
I WOULD EXPLAIN FURTHER BUT WHY
I SHOULD CARE IF YOU UNDERSTAND.
>> I'M CHALLENGING THIS AT
TOURISM.
>> WHY THEN IS THIS KIND OF LOVE
IN YOUR MIND IMMORAL?
>> IT'S IMMORAL IF IT'S PLACE
ADD ABOVE ONE'S SELF.
>> IF A MAN IS WEAK OR A WOMAN
IS WEAK HE IS OR SHE IS BEYOND
LOVE.
>> CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE
IT.
>> Stephen: THIS PHILOSOPHY IS
BEST EXPRESSED IN HER LINE OF
BIRTHDAY CARDS "GRANDMOTHER YOU
ARE A DRAIN OF SOCIETY.
I ATE YOUR CAKE."
TOUGH LOVE.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I'M HAPPY TOP SAY FINALLY
ATLAS SHRUGGED HAS BEEN ADAPTED
FOR THE BIG SCREEN.
IT TELLS THE STORY OF WEALTHY
INDUSTRIALISTS LED BY INVENTOR
WHO GONE ON STRIKE TO DENY THEIR
TALENTS TO AN UNWORTHY IS
SOCIETY.
JIMMY --
>> SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO WORK FOR HIMSELF AND NOT
WITH OTHERS SPEED UP THE PROCESS
OF SYNERGY.
>> THEY SAY YOU ARE INTRACTABLE.
YOU ARE RUTHLESS YOUR ONLY GOAL
IS TO MAKE MONEY.
>> MY ONLY GOAL IS TO MAKE
MONEY.
>> Stephen: WOW.
I HAVEN'T SEEN A FILM WITH THAT
MESSAGE SINCE TRANSFORMERS 2.
[LAUGHTER]
BIG SURPRISE, FOLKS, LIBERAL
HOLLYWOOD IS CONSPIRING TO
DESTROY IT.
IT HAS A 9% RATING ON ROTTEN
TOMATOES AND IN ITS THIRD WEEK
IT MADE JUST $468,000.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE MOST AMERICANS
DON'T WANT TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT
HOW MOST AMERICANS ARE
PARASITES.
THE PRODUCER AND WRITER SAYS HE
MIGHT NOT MAKE THE TWO PLANNED
SEQUELS SAYING CRITICS YOU WON
AND HAS THREATENED TO GO ON
STRIKE.
TRULY A LESSON FROM THE PAGES OF
AYN RAND.
IF YOU ARE TALENTED AND HARD
WORKING ONE DAY YOU, TOO, COULD
GIVE UP.
[LAUGHTER]
I LOVE THIS MOVIE, FOLKS BECAUSE
THE HEROS SAY THINGS THAT WOULD
MAKE THEM VILLAINS IN ANY
STANDARD HOLLYWOOD FARE.
>> CALL MY OFFICE FIRST THING IN
MY MORNING I'LL AUTHORIZE
$100,000 FOR YOU.
>> YOU REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE HELPING THE UNDERPRIVILEGED
DO YOU?
>> NO, PHILIP, I DON'T.
>> Stephen: I KNOW WHAT ATLAS
WAS SHRUGGING AT.
OTHER PEOPLE SUFFERING.
THEY LET ME SEE CLASSIC
HOLLYWOOD FILMS IN A WHOLE NEW
LIGHT.
I KNOW THAT ITS ITS A WONDERFUL
LIFE IS REALLY THE STORY OF A
REAL ESTATE MAGNET WHO OVERCOMES
HIS ABILITY TO --
[LAUGHTER]
STAR WARS, STAR WARS IS REALLY
ABOUT A GROUP OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL
ALIENS PLOTTING TO BLOW UP A
GATED COMMUNITY.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, AMERICA, YOU MUST SEE "ATLAS
SHRUGGED" DO IT FOR JOHN, DO IT
