WITHIN WELCOME BACK.
WE RETURN WITH MORE FROM
GOVERNOR BUDDY ROEMER WHO
SAY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT.
NOW SIR YOU SAY YOU DON'T
LIKE PACS.
I WITH I HAVE FOUND THAT
DONORS TO PACS ARE SOME OF
THE MOST INTELLIGENT,
BEAUTIFUL AND OR HANDSOME
PEOPLE IN AMERICA.
YOU KEEP THE DONATIONS TO
WHAT, WHAT IS THE LIMB SNIT.

IN THERE.
BUDDYROEMER.COM.
NO, I RESPECT THAT.
I RESPECT THAT.
BUT $100, $100 FROM 300
MILLION AMERICANS IS ONLY
$30 BILLION.
HOW YOU CAN EXPECT TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENT --
>> ALL I NEED IS A MILLION
AMERICANS.
IF I CAN GET A MILLION
AMERICANS TO STAND UP TO THE
RIGHT THING AGAINST THE BIG
CHECKS, WE WIN.
ONE MILLION.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT STANDING UP
FOR THE RIGHT THING.
ARE YOU GOING TO IOWA, ARE
YOU ON THE BALLOT IN AMES.
>> I AM NOT.
>> Stephen: WHY AREN'T YOU
ON THE BALLOT?
>> IT'S CALLED $15,000, THAT
IS THE PRICE OF HAVING A
BOOTH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
KBAL OT.
AND I LOVE IOWA.
I'M A FARMER, I'M A COTTON
FARMER.
IT'S THE WAY I GREW UP.
THEY'RE FARMERS THERE.
I LOVE GOING TO GET THE VOTE
BUT I DO NOT HAVE THE PAC
MONEY REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT
SORT OF INVESTMENT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
NOW HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
WE'RE GETTING INTO DANGEROUS
TERRITORY.
BECAUSE YOU NEED HELP IN
IOWA AND I CAN'T PLAN TO
HELP YOU, OKAY.
SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL
THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHAT
KIND OF HELP YOU NEED IN
IOWA.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND THE KIND OF
MESSAGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO
GIVE TO THE IOWANS BUT
LEGALLY I CAN'T HEAR IT SO
WHILE YOU TALK I WILL BE
PUTTING ON THE CONE OF
SILENCE.
>> OH, MAN.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT I WANT TO YOU DO IS I
WANT TO YOU HIT THE PLAY
BUTTON, HIT THE PLAY BUTTON
RIGHT THERE BEFORE YOU START
TALKING.
>> BEFORE I START, OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I NEED PLAIN PEOPLE IN
IOWA.
I NEED PEOPLE, I NEED PEOPLE
WHO FARM, I NEED SMALL
BUSINESSPEOPLE, I NEED
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUILD
ROADS, I NEED EVERY PEOPLE
IN IOWA.
I DON'T NEED THE FAT CATS.
I NEED EVERY PLAIN,
HARDWORKING PEOPLE.
I NEED REPUBLICANS, I NEED
INDEPENDENTS, I NEED THEM
ALL.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK YOU CAN LISTEN NOW,
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: SAY THAT AGAIN.
JUST TAP IT, GRANDPA.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW LEGALLY I CAN GO HOME
AND WATCH THE SHOW TONIGHT
AND HEAR YOU WHAT SAID.
>> YOU CAN DO THAT.
>> Stephen: I JUST COULDN'T
BE HERE WITH YOU PLAN.
>> SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE.
>> Stephen: NO.
WE CANNOT COMMUNICATE.

>> Stephen: DOES THAT MAKE
SENSE.
