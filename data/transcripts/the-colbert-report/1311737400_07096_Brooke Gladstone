SMEUP WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW
GRAPHIC NOVEL.
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO GRAPHIC,
THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME BROOKE GLADSTONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, BROOKE!
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING ON!
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU ARE THE
HOST OF NPR'S "ON THE MEDIA."
AND YOU ARE ALSO THE AUTHOR OF
THE NEW BOOK "THE INFLUENCING
MACHINE: BROOKE GLADSTONE ON THE
MEDIA."
WHAT IS THE INFLUENCE MAGAZINE?
IS IT THIS?
>> YES, ACTUALLY, IT IS.
>> Stephen: I AM A MEMBER OF
THE MEDIA?
>> YOU ARE PART OF THE INFLUENCE
MAGAZINE.
EXCEPT THAT THERE IS NO
INFLUENCING MACHINE.
THIS IT TOO IS WHAT I WANT TO
FIGHT: THE POPULAR NOTION THAT
THE MEDIA ARE CONTROLLING OUR
MINDS.
IT'S REALLY A MIRROR.
WHAT?
NO, I HAVE CONTROL!
I HAVE CONTROL.
CLAP FOR ME, MY MONKEYS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I BELIEVE THE WORDS YOU EAR
LOOKING FOR "CHECK AND MATE."
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE MEDIA DOES NOT HAVE... BUT
THAT'S EVERYTHING THAT I SHEAR
THAT THE MEDIA HAS CONTROL OVER
THE MINDS OF ITS AUDIENCE.
WE'RE ALL BEING BRAINWASHED.
>> WELL, THE MEDIA ARE
REFLECTING EVERYTHING THAT WE
ARE AS A PEOPLE AND AS A
CIVILIZATION.
AND SOME OF THAT IS PRETTY
DISGUSTING.
SOME OF THAT IS PRETTY SHALLOW.
SOME OF THAT IS TRIVIAL.
SOME OF IT IS FRIVOLOUS AND SOME
OF IT IS JUST PLAIN MENDACIOUS.
>>MENDACIOUS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO
TALK ABOUT ME THE ENTIRE
INTERVIEW?
(LAUGHTER)
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, SO MUCH OF
THE MEDIA IS EVERYTHING THAT WE
WANT IT TO BE.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIBERAL.
(LAUGHTER)
THE MEDIA HAS A LIBERAL BIAS.
THIS WE KNOW.
THE MEDIA-- EXCEPT FOR FOX NEWS,
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND A
COUPLE OTHER MURDOCH HOLDINGS--
ALL PARTS OF THE MEDIA HAVE A
LIBERAL BIAS.
YOU CAN NOT DENY THAT.
>> ACTUALLY, THERE WAS A STUD
THEY GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY
DID, THE FIRST SEVEN MONTHS OF
EVERY PRESIDENT FROM REAGAN
THROUGH OBAMA AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE MEDIA HATES PRESIDENTS.
THE POSITIVE COVERAGE IS IN THE
30s AND AS A MATTER OF FACT
CLINTON CAME OFF WORSE AND OBAMA
CAME OFF WORSE IN THEIR FIRST
SEVEN MONTHS THAN THE
REPUBLICANS AND, OF COURSE,
IN... ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL, THE
OBAMA NUMBERS WERE AT LEAST 12
POINTS LOWER.
>> Stephen: WELL, THEY HAVE TO
BE FAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
OBAMA IS 12 POINTS WORSE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> ON FOX.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO THIS IS... I MEAN, IT'S A
GREAT BOOK.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A GRAPHIC
NOVEL.
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF PICTURES IN
HERE.
IT'S A... IT'S A COMIC BOOK.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: AND YOU'RE IN IT A
LOT.
>> YES, I AM.
>> Stephen: IF YOU'RE GOING TO
PUT YOURSELF IN A COMIC BOOK,
WHY CAST YOURSELF AS AN NPR
HOST?
(LAUGHTER)
WHY NOT GIVE YOURSELF, LIKE,
HEAT VISION OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT?
WHY DO IT IN THIS PARTICULAR
MEDIUM?
YOU KNOW, AS A MARSHALL
McLEWIN SAID, THE MEDIUM IS
THE MESSAGE.
WHAT IS THE MESSAGE OF YOUR
MEDIUM BEING CARTOONS TO EXPLAIN
OUR MEDIA?
>> WELL, PART OF IT IS A
GAUNTLET THAT I'M THROWING DOWN
AT THE IDEA THAT ONLY WORDS CAN
EXPRESS COMPLICATED IDEAS.
ANOTHER PART OF IT IS THAT IT'S
MORE LIKE RADIO, AND RAID JOE
WHAT I KNOW.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND?
PICTURES ARE MORE LIKE RADIO?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE INSANE!
(LAUGHTER)
>> YES!
THAT'S TRUE.
BUT THINK ABOUT IT: RADIO IS AN
INCREDIBLY INTIMATE MEDIUM,
RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO...
>> Stephen: I USUALLY LISTEN
TO IT NAKED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU HAVE TO RELY ON A
PERSON'S VOICE WHICH IS SO
PERSONAL TO LEAD YOU THROUGH AWE
THICKET OF IDEAS, TO TAKE YOU
THROUGH A DIFFICULT SITUATION.
I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SPEAK
IN BUBBLES AND LOOK THE READER
DIRECTLY IN THE EYE THAT I WOULD
BE ABLE TO APPROXIMATE THE
INTIMACY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP.
ALSO, I GET TO BE A DOG, I GET
TO BE SPIDER-MAN, BRIDE OF
FRANKENSTEIN, MEDUSA, THE ONLY
ONE I DON'T GET TO BE IS BUFFY
AND IT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME!
(APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT
THERE IS ANY BIAS IN ANY OF THE
MEDIA?
BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO BE EXPUNGING
ALL GUILT FROM THE RECORD OF THE
MEDIA HERE.
>> ONLY IF YOU THINK THAT BIAS
HAS TO BE POLITICAL.
THERE ARE BIG BIASES IN THE
MEDIA.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR BIAS?
YOU WORK FOR NPR, I ASSUME YOU
HAVE A PRO TOTE BAG AGENDA.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT IS YOUR BIAS?
>> I HAVE A PRO TRANSPARENCY
AGENDA.
I GENERALLY LIKE LESS SECRECY,
MORE SUNSHINE, ALTHOUGH I DO
HAVE A FAIRLY LARGE SELECTION OF
TOTE BAGS.
SORRY.
>> Stephen:S WHERE THE WORST
BIAS YOU SEEN IN OTHER MEDIA?
>> I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL
THERE'S BAD NEWS BIAS.
THAT'S THE NOTION THAT... THAT
MAKES YOU THINK THE WORLD IS
MUCH SCARIER THAN IT IS.
AND THAT'S A VERY BAD THING.
>> Stephen: HOW BAD?
COULD IT KILL US?
(LAUGHTER)
>> BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THINGS LIKE SOCIALISM AND
SEXTING THEN YOU'RE SO
DISTRACTED YOU WON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE FACT THAT IT'S EASY TO CARRY
A BOMB ON TO A TRAIN.
SO THERE'S THAT.
THEN THERE'S NARRATIVE BIASES.
>> Stephen: WELL, ON THE NOTE
OF IT'S EASY TO CARRY A BOMB ON
TO A TRAIN, SLEEP TIGHT,
AMERICA.
BROOKE GLADSTONE, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: "THE INFLUENCING
MACHINE."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
