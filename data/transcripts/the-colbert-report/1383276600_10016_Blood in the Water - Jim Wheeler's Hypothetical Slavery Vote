>> Colbert: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY!  FOLKS, THANKS SO
MUCH.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOWYOU KNOW THAT I AM SO
DISAPPOINTED BY THE U.S.
CONGRESS.
I ONLY VOTE FOR WASHINGTONOUTSIDERS BUT THE DAY THEY ARE
ELECTED, WHAT DO THEY DO?  MOVETO WASHINGTON.
LUCKILY, SOME POLITICIANS STAYTRUE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS.
EVEN WHEN THEY GET DEVOURED IN AFEEDING FRENZY.
THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
>> SHARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK.
SHARK.
>> Colbert: RECENTLY LEARNED IAM A HUGE FAN OF NEVADA STATE
ASSEMBLYMAN AND EXTRA IN A COENBROTHERS MOVIE, JIM WHEELER.
AT A RECENT REPUBLICAN PARTYMEETING WHEELER EXPLAINED HOW HE
HAD RESPONDED TO A CRITIC WHOACCUSED HIM OF BEING SO WEAK
THAT IF HIS CONSTITUENTS WANTEDHIM TO, HE WOULD VOTE FOR
SLAVERY.
>> IF THE CITIZENS OF THEDISTRICT 39 WANTED TO MAKE
SLAVERY LEGAL, I WOULD VOTE FORSLAVERY.
YEAH.
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT, IWOULD HAVE TO HOLD MY NOSE AND
BITE MY TONGUE AND PROBABLY HAVETO HOLD A GUN TO MY HEAD, BUT,
YEAH, IF THAT'S WHAT THECITIZENS OF MY CONSTITUENCY
WANTS WHO ELECTED ME THAT'S WHATTHEY ELECTED ME FOR, THAT'S WHAT
A PUBLIC IS.
>> Colbert: THAT'S RIGHT WHENWE VOTERS ELECT SOMEONE WE
BECOME HIS MASTER AND HE MUST DOWHAT WE SAY UNDER THE THREAT OF
VIOLENCE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE WORD FOR THAT,DEMOCRACY.
AND THIS MUST MAKE A HELL OF ABUMPER STICKER, JIM WHEELER, YOU
WANT SLAVES, YOU GOT THEM.
BUT OF COURSE, INSTEAD, INSTEADOF SEEING JIM WHEELER AS A
DEDICATED LAW MAKER THE THEY SAWHIM AS CHUM.
>> OTHER NEVADA LAWMAKERS ARESPEAKING AGAINST THE COMMENTS.
BRIAN SANDOVAL SAYS THOSECOMMENTS FROM WHEELER ARE DEEPLY
OFFENSIVE.
>> THE METRO CHAMBER OF COMMERCEHAS CALLED FOR ASSEMBLYMAN WHEEL
TORE RESIGN.
>> THE NEVADA DEMOCRATIC PARTYCALLED WHEELER'S COMMENTS
DISGUSTING AND EMBARRASSING TOTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
NEVADA.
>> Colbert: OH COME ON THEREIS NOTHING THAT EMBARRASS IT IS
STATE OF NEVADA.
THE STATE FLAG IS A MAN ON AJAZZY PUMPING NICKELS INTO A
SLOT MACHINE.
FOLKS, THIS IS NOTHING MORE,THINKABLE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A
LIBERAL HIT JOB.
THE MEDIA TWISTED WHEELER'SSTATEMENT ALL AROUND.
AS HE MADE CLEAR ON HIS WEB SITEIN A CAREFULLY WORDING
EXPLANATION, THE ACCUSATIONSAGAINST HIM ARE ABSURD TO ANYONE
THAT VIEWED THE COMMENTS INCONTEXT.
EXACTLY.
SO LET ME GIVE YOU THE ENTIRECONTEXT TO CLEAR THIS UP.
SOMEONE SAID THAT HE WOULD VOTETO BRING BACK SLAVERY AND HE
RESPONDED, YES, I WOULD.
SEE.
A LITTLE MORE, A LITTLE MORENUANCED, ISN'T IT?  AND JUST
LISTEN TO WHAT WHEELER TOLD THEEIGHT NEWS I TEAM, NEVADA'S NEWS
LEADER.
>> WHEELER TOLD THE I TEAM HE ISPROBABLY THE LEAST BIGOTED GUY
IN THE WORLD.
>> Colbert: YEAH, THE LEASTBIGOTED.
SO MOVE OVER DESMOND TUTUBECAUSE THERE IS NEW SHERIFF IN
TOWN AND HE IS WILLING TOENSLAVE YOU.
SO YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, FOLKS--
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Colbert: COME TO THINK OF
IT, FOLKS, HIS CRITICS AREREALLY THE RACISTS.
FOR ASSUMING THAT JIM WHEELERMEANS BLACK SLAVERY.
MAYBE HE WOULD VOTE TO ENSLAVELATINOS OR YOUNG GREEK BOYS OR
WHITE PEOPLE.
HE WILL ENSLAVE ANYONE YOU WANT.
HELL, IF JIM WHEELER'S VOTERSWANT TO SELL THEIR BLONDE
DAUGHTERS TO MALAYSIAN DRUGLORDS THAT IS JOB ONE.
SO I AM CALLING ON ASSEMBLYMAN'SCONSTITUENTS TO JUST PROVE HOW
DEDICATED THIS MAN IS.
START A PETITION CALLING ON JIMWHEEL TORE PUNCH HIMSELF IN THE
BALLS.
I MEAN, A SOLID NUT PUNCH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Colbert: NOT ONE OF THOSE
KNUCKLE GLANCERS, THECONSTITUENTS DEMAND A REAL WIND
UP JUNK STUNNER.
ASSEMBLYMAN, YOU DO THE WILL OFTHE PEOPLE AND I GUARANTEE YOU
THAT YOUTUBE VIDEO WILL GET ALOT MORE LIKES THAN YOUR SLAVERY
ONE.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
