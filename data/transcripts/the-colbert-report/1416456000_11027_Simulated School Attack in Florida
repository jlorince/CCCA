>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, HEROES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
ALWAYS A JOY.
( CHEERS )FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH
THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVECOMING TO YOU EVERY NIGHT OF THE
WEEK, MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.
( LAUGHTER )BUT BROADCASTING LEGEND ISN'T MY
MOST IMPORTANT JOB.
I'M ALSO A DAD.
THAT I KNOW OF.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S WHY I HAVE THE RIGHT TO
JUDGE TODAY'S OVER-INVOLVEDHELICOPTER PARENTS.
IF YOU'RE THAT NEUROTIC ABOUTYOUR KID'S SAFETY, WHY DID YOU
GIVE THEM A HELICOPTER IN THEFIRST PLACE?
( LAUGHTER )THEY HAVE CREATED-- THESE
PARENTS HAVE CREATE AGENERATION OF SCAREDY KIDS WHO
QUIVER AT THE SLIGHTEST ARMEDINVASION.
>> NOW TO FLORIDA TONIGHT WHEREPARENTS ARE OUTRAGED AFTER
POLICE ENTERED A MIDDLE SCHOOLWITHOUT WARNING WITH WHAT LOOKED
LIKE GUNS DRAWN.
BUT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT NEXT HASMANY ANGRY TONIGHT.
IT WAS A DRILL.
>> POLICE WITH AR-15 RIFLES LIKETHIS ONE, BURST INTO CLASSROOMS.
CHILDREN AND TEACHERS BELIEVEDTHEY WERE REALLY UNDER ATTACK.
>> STUDENTS, SOME TEXTING THEIRPARENTS FOR HELP, THEY WERE
TERRIFIED.
>> Stephen: TYPICAL TEENS--CAN'T EVEN STOP TEXTING AT
GUNPOINT.
( LAUGHTER )FOR PETE'S SAKE!
WE'VE GOT VISITORS!
PUT THE PHONE DOWN AND CRAP YOURPANTS.
( LAUGHTER )MANNERS.
LOOK, I KNOW THESE DRILLS CAN BEUPSETTING, BUT THEY SERVE A
VITAL PURPOSE.
COPS GET TRAINING RESPONDING TOSCHOOL EMERGENCIES, AND IN THE
EVENT OF A REAL TRAGEDY, THEKIDS WILL BE GLAD THEY HAD ALL
THOSE PRACTICE NIGHTMARES.
( LAUGHTER )BESIDES, SCHOOL OFFICIALS HAD
GOOD REASON TO GIVE THESE KIDSP.T.S.D.-- OR PRETEND TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER.
JIM?
>> POLICE SAY THE DRILLS AREALWAYS HELD WITHOUT ADVANCE
WARNING BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLYWAY THAT THEY CAN EVALUATE A
SCHOOL'S RESPONSE.
>> SCHOOL OFFICIALS INSIST THEELEMENT OF SURPRISE IS
IMPORTANT, NOTING,UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE GETS AN
ADVANCED NOTICE OF REAL-LIFEEMERGENCIES.
>>>> Stephen:  IT'S TRUE.
THERE IS NO ADVANCE NOTICE IN AREAL-LIFE EMERGENCY.
WHICH IS WHY I NEVER WARN MYSTAFF ABOUT OUR FIRE DRILLS.
I DON'T EVEN WARN MYSELF.
I LEAVE A PILE OF OILY RAGS NEXTTO THE FURNACE, AND I WAIT FOR
THE DRILL TO START WHEN IT'SREADY.
( LAUGHTER )WE'RE-- WE'RE ACTUALLY ON OUR
FIFTH STUDIO HERE.
THAT'S WHY THE SHOW IS ENDING.
I CAN'T GET INSURANCE.
