PRESIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
WE KNOW THE REAL REASON THAT
CAIN WANTS TO GET THIS ONE,
EVERYONE IN D.C. IS TALKING
ABOUT MY FUND-RAISING POLITICAL
ACTION COMMITTEE COLBERT PAC
FOUNDED BY ME.
OH, THEY LOVE IT.
FOUNDED BY ME SO THAT THIS
ELECTION THE COLBERT NATION
COULD HAVE A VOICE IN THE FORM
OF MY VOICE SHOUTED THROUGH A
MEGA PHONE MADE OF CASH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHEN I ANNOUNCED COLBERT PAC ON
THE AIR MY PARENT COMPANY VIACOM
FREAKED BECAUSE LEGALLY IT IS
ILLEGAL.
CORPORATIONS CANNOT DONATE TO
PACS AND THEY SAY USING MY SHOW
TO TALK ABOUT A PC IS A
DONATION.
I DID THE RIGHT THING AND
EXPLOITED A LOOPHOLE.
THANKS TO THE SCOWRT CITIZENS
UNITED RULING CORPORATIONS THAT
CAN'T GIVE ANY MONEY TO A PAC
CAN GIVE UNLIMITED NONA
SUPERPAC.
THERE'S A DISTENSION BETWEEN A
PAC AND A SUPERPAC.
ONE HAS THE WORD SUPERIN ITS
NAME.
I TOOK COLBERT PAC AND I MADE IT
COLBERT SUPERPAC.
PAC, SUPERPAC.
CLARK KENT, SUPERMAN.
BRUCE WAYNE, BATMAN, GORDITA,
GORDITA SUPREME.
EVEN THIS WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE IDIOTS AT VIACOM WHO
EMPLOY ME AND MADE ME A STAR.
I JUST GOT THIS LETTER FROM
VIACOM'S LAWYERS.
I'LL READ IT ON THE AIR.
THEY SAY, PLEASE DO NOT READ
THIS ON THE AIR.
I CANNOT SEE THIS COMING.
JIMMY, LET'S REMEMBER TO EDIT
THAT OUT.
I'LL GIVE IT A SKIM HERE.
DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, MEE MEOW
, I'LL PARAPHRASE.
WE ARE STUPID LAWYERS WHO HATE
FUNDS.
IF DO YOU THIS WE'RE SCARED THAT
PEOPLE MIGHT GET MAD AT US.
WE PAOED A LITTLE.
EVEN THOUGH WE IT'S TOTALLY
LEGAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET DO
YOU IT SINCERELY JOHN C -- I
HATE MY PARENT COMPANY!
THEY NEVER LET ME DO ANYTHING.
[LAUGHTER]
EVERYONE ELSE EA PARENT COMPANY
LET THEM DO IT.
