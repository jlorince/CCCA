>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO
TALK ABOUT HOW SUSPICIOUS
AMERICANS ARE OF MUSLIMS.
AND I THINK HE'S A MUSLIM.
PLEASE WELCOME REZA ASLAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> REZA, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> WELCOME BACK.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> I GOT TO SAY THE FIRST
COUPLE OF TIMES YOU WERE
HERE I WAS NOT SCARED OF YOU,
OKAY.
NOW YOU KNOW BETTER.
>> HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO
PULL THAT OFF.
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW I SHOULD
BE SUSPICIOUS OF YOU.
>> YES, I'M HERE TO TELL THE
TRUTH TO AMERICA, WHICH
IS --
>> BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY.
PETER KING HELD THESE
HEARINGS TO FIND OUT THE
TRUTH.
WHY ARE YOU AGAINST THE
TRUTH.
>> NO, I MEANS THAT'S WHAT I
WAS GOING TO SAY, THAT THE
TRUTH IS THAT WE MUSLIMSES
HAVE COME TO AMERICA TO EAT
YOUR BABIES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND --
>> DOES THAT FEEL GOOD.
>> IT DOES.
I GOT IT OUT.
NO, LOOK, THERE IS A SERIOUS
PROBLEM WITH HOME GROUP
TERRORISM IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> THE FT. HOOD ATTACK.
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT
THAT.
BUT USUALLY WHEN CONGRESS
TACKLES SERIOUS PROBLEMS
THEY BRING IN EXPERTS TO
TESTIFY AND THAT IS NOT WHAT
IS HAPPENING.
YOU HAVE GOT THIS GROUP OF
INDIVIDUALS BEING ASKED TO
GIVE PERSONAL OPINIONS ON
MATTERS THEY ARE NOT
QUALIFIED TO TESTIFY ABOUT.
>> YOU ARE SAYING ONLY THE
ELITE-- YOU ARE SAYING
EXPERTS.
LET ME SAY, ARE YOU AN
EXPERT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT I
DID WRITE A Ph.D
DISSERTATION ON RADICALLIZATION
OF MUSLIMS.
>> OH, NO.
>> IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE
LIKE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS
ON GLOBAL WARMINGING WE
WOULD HAVE SCIENTISTS
TESTIFY, NOT JUST SOME
RANDOM GUY FROM MINNESOTA
TALKING ABOUT HOW HOT THE
WEATHER IS.
SCIENTISTS AND MINISTERS.
>> WE WOULD HAVE BOTH OF
THEM IN THERE.
>> BOTH SIDES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> BOTH SIDES OF THE DEBATE.
>> BUT YOU THINK THAT THIS
IS A WITCH-HUNT, RIGHT?
>> NO.
>> WE ARE DEMONIZING MUSLIMS,
THAT IS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING.
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS A
WITCH-HUNT.
I THINK IT IS A USELESS
ENTERPRISE.
THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND
IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY AN INSTEAD WHAT
WE'VE GOT IS THIS POLITICAL
STUNT BY A MAN WHO KEEPS
THROWING OUT THESE
RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS ABOUT
HOW 85% OF MUSLIMS ARE
RADICALLIZED AND NEVER
BROTHERS TO-- BOTHERS TO
CITE ANY STATISTIC.
>> HE DID NOT SAY 58% ARE
RADICALLIZED, HE SAID 85% OF
MOSQUES WERE RADICALLIZED.
HE SAID THIS IS NOT
TARGETING MUSLIMS IN
GENERAL.
HE ALSO SAID THAT THE VAST
MAJORITY OF MUSLIMSES ARE
GOOD LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH
THAT.
>> THAT'S LIKE SAYING I
DON'T WANT TO HANG AROUND
WITH BLACK PEOPLE, BUT SOME
OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE
BLACK.
IT'S JUST --
>> SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS
ARE BLACK, SIR.
OH, SHOULD I NOT HAVE BLACK
FRIENDS WHO IS THE RACIST
NOW.
>> HOW MANY MUSLIM FRIENDS
DO YOU HAVE.
>> SOME OF THE BLACK GUYS
COULD BE MUSLIM.
I DON'T ASK.
I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS
THEM.
>> DO THEIR NAMES END IN X?
>> WHAT.
>> NEVER MIND.
>> ARE YOU A MUSLIM.
>> I SUSPECTED THAT YOU WERE,
THAT IS WHY I INVITED YOU
HERE.
>> ARE WE FRIENDS.
>> WE ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS,
THEN ARE YOU MY MUSLIM
FRIEND.
>> FROM NOW ON, REZA ASLAN,
MY MUSLIM FRIEND.
THE ISSUE IS ISN'T THE FACT
THAT THIS IS, YOU KNOW, A
PROBLEM.
IT IS A PROBLEM.
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS
PROBLEM SERIOUSLY.
AND INSTEAD WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS JUST, YOU KNOW, KIND OF
GIVING IN TO THIS RIDICULOUS
RHETORIC ABOUT YOU KNOW, THE
ENEMY WITHIN.
AND HOW YOU KNOW THERE IS
RADICALLIZATION OF --
>> BUT THERE IS AN ENEMY
WITHIN.
>> THERE IS AN ENEMY
WITHIN YOU CAN LAUGH IT AWAY
ALL YOU WANT, SIR.
BUT SOME OF YOUR FELLOW
MUSLIMS HAVE IT IN FOR THE
UNITED STATES.
AND SO --
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> SO ISN'T IT BETTER TO YOU
KNOW, BURN THE ENTIRE
HAYSTACK TO FIND THE
NEEDLES?
>> WELL, LOOK--
(LAUGHTER)
>> SHOULD WE HAVE EVERY QAT
LICK TESTIFY AGAINST
PEDOPHILIA.
>> WER'S NOT TALKING ABOUT
CATHOLICS HERE.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
CATHOLICS HERE.
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MUSLIMSES, JEEZ.
>> I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE ARE
TALKING BEING MUSLIMS.
BUT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY FACE
THE FACT AND DEAL WITH THE
DATA.
AND THE DATA AS LEE BACA
HIMSELF WHO TESTIFIED TODAY
SAID, IS THAT SINCE 2011
THERE -- 2001 THERE HAS
ACTUALLY BEEN MORE VIOLENT
EXTREMIST PLOTS AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES BY NONMUSLIMS
THAN BY MUSLIMS.
SO LET'S ACTUALLY DEAL WITH
THE PROBLEM AT HAND.
>> BUT THOSE ARE ALL
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE
DOING THAT.
>> COME ON.
>> I MEAN LISTEN, GET TO
THAT.
WE'LL GET TO THAT YOU HAVE
TO TAKE THINGS ONE THING AT
A TIME.
AND IT IS HARD TO GENERALIZE
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE
THEY DON'T SELF-ORGANIZE.
>> VERY GOOD POINT.
>> IN THE SAME WAY YOU GUYS
DO.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS MAKE A HANDY
TARGET.
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE A
TARGET, YOU SHOULD --
>> STOP BEING MUSLIM.
>> THERE YOU GO, YEAH.
EASY, WHY NOT.
EAT A LITTLE PORK.
>> LET'S GET SOME BACON AND
WINE HERE.
>> GO TO CHURCH ONCE IN A
WHILE, WOULD IT KILL YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU GUYS BELIEVE IN JESUS,
RIGHT.
YOU BELIEVE IN THE JESUS.
>> BUT LOOK, I'M SAYING
THAT --
>> WE DO BELIEVE IN THE
JESUS.
>> YES, DOW.
>> IF WE ARE GOING TO
ACTUALLY DEAL WITH MUSLIM
RADICALLIZATION WHICH IS A
PROBLEM T HAS TO BE DEALT
WITH.
>> WHEN WERE YOU
RADICALLIZED.
>> AFTER THE SHOW, WE'LL
TALK.
>> OKAY.
>> BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
IT AS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM AND
BRING IN PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY
CAN TALK ABOUT IT, TO TALK
ABOUT THE DATA.
>> WHO WOULD YOU HAVE
BROUGHT IN.
>> ME?
>> I KNEW IT.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID AT THE
BEGINNING THIS IS ALL ABOUT
GET ARE YOUR BEAK WET HERE
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE PRESS.
>> THE ENTIRE WEST POINT
TERRORISM CENTER, THE PEOPLE
AT THE TRIANGLE CENTER FOR
FERR RICH AND HOMELAND
SECURITY WHICH BY THE WAY
SAID THAT DESPITE WHAT PETER
KING SAID ALMOST HALF OF ALL
TERRORIST CONVICTIONS IN THE
LAST TWO YEARS WERE TURNED
IN BY MUSLIMS SO THIS IDEA
THAT MUSLIMS AREN'T --
>> YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN TRUST
EACH OTHER.
>> THE POINT IS THAT --
>> THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
>> THEY ARE DOING THEIR JOBS
AS AMERICANS AND ACTUALLY
TURNING IN THEIR OWN WHEN
THEY SEE RADICALLIZATION
UNLIKE WHAT PETER KING KEEPS
SAYING.
AND BY THE WAY I WOULD JUST
LIKE PETER KING TO GIVE ME
ONE SET OF DATA, ONE
RESEARCH, ONE STATISTIC THAT
ACTUALLY PROVES THAT MUSLIMS
AREN'T ACTUALLY COOPERATING.
ALL HE KEEPS SAYING IS THAT
OH, I HEAR IT FROM PEOPLE.
WHICH IS, I HAVE HEARD FROM
PEOPLE THAT PETER KING IS A
DICK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T
HAVE ANY DATA.
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT.
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY
RESEARCH.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT.
>> I JUST HEAR IT, I FEEL T
I FEEL IT
(APPLAUSE)
>> I FEEL IT.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S HOLD
SOME HEARING
