[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
FOLKS, I -- I WILL PUT OUT.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
I DON'T LIKE.
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE
CLAIM A CONNECTION TO ME THAT
DOESN'T REALLY EXIST.
YOU HEAR ME LUCAN.
YOU ARE NOT MY REAL FATHER.
YOU FOUND ME IN THE FOREST AND
RAISED ME AS YOUR OWN [HOWLS]
WELL SOMEONE IS DBLOMMING ON TO
ME AGAIN.
I DECLARED THAT FORMER
GODFATHER'S C.E.O. HERMAN CAIN
WON THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
DEBATE AND WHAT DO I SEE ON
TWITTER?
HERMAN CAIN TWEETING "APPARENTLY
I GOT THE COLBERT BUMP LAST
NIGHT."
WHOA WHOA WHOA, PUT YOUR CAIN
BACK IN YOUR PANTS, HERMAN.v:
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY I'M A FAN.
I MAY EVEN BE A WILD-EYED
KAINIAC.
I DID NOT BUMP YOU, SIR.
JUST MENTIONING YOU DOESN'T GIVE
IT THE BUMP.
I HAVE TOç BEçó CAREFUL WHERE I
POINT THIS THING BECAUSE IT IS
LOADED AND POWERFUL.
I TALK ABOUT HITLER, LINDSAY
LOHAN AND CHLAMYDIA.
I WAS NOT GIVING THEM THE BUMP.
THAT WAS JUST SWEEPS WEEK.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THE
COLBERT BUMP.
YOU COME ON MY SHOW, SIR.
YOU GET THE BUMP FOR REAL AND
YOU COULD END UP BEING OUR
NATION'S
