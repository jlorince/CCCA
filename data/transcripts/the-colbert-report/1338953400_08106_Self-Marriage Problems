(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
NATION... THANK YOU, FOLKS.
NATION, IT IS JUNE AND THAT MEANS WEDDING SEASON.
TRAVELING TO SEE ALL YOUR OLD FRIENDS, STAYING IN FANCY HOTELS, PICKING THE PERFECT GIFT
TO CELEBRATE A LIFETIME OF LOVE.
SORRY, I ALWAYS GET SO EMOTIONAL ON HOW MUCH I SPENT ON OTHER PEOPLE'S WEDDINGS.
FOLKS, ALL THAT JOY CAN BARELY CONTAIN MY RAGE OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RECENT ENDORSEMENT OF
THE GAY MARRIAGE.
(LAUGHTER) I HAVE LONG WARNED THAT LETTING THE GAYS MARRY IS A SLIPPERY
SLOPE TO EVEN FREAKIER STUFF.
WELL, FOLKS, I WAS RIGHT.
>> ONE NORTH DAKOTA WOMAN DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT AROUND FOR MR. RIGHT TO MAKE HER HAPPY SO
SHE MARRIED HERSELF.
SHE SAYS AT ONE POINT IN HER LIFE SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY UNTIL SHE DISCOVERED THE LOVE SHE
CRAVED HAD TO COME FROM WITHIN,
FROM HERSELF.
SO SHE CHOSE TO MARRY HERSELF IN A COMMITMENT CEREMONY IN MARCH.
>> Stephen: THIS COMES AS A SERIOUS BLOW TO PEOPLE FROM NORTH DAKOTA.
YOUR STATE FINALLY GETS A WOMAN AND SHE DECIDES TO MARRY HERSELF.
(LAUGHTER) I'M SO SORRY, RICK.
HE'S SO LONELY.
AND THIS WOMAN IS NOT ALONE IN HER LOVE OF ALONENESS.
SELF-MARRIAGE CEREMONIES HAVE ALSO TAKEN PLACE IN THE NETHERLANDS AND TAIWAN.
WOW!
FIRST YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO MARRY YOURSELF THEN YOU MAKE IT A DESTINATION WEDDING?
(LAUGHTER) ONCE SELF-MARRIAGE BECOMES THE NORM, IMAGINE ALL THE SOCIETAL PRESSURE.
YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE LIKE, HEY,
YOU'VE BEEN WITH YOURSELF FOR 48 YEARS AND YOU'RE STILL NOT ENTKWAEUPBLGED?
WHAT IS HE/YOU WAITING FOR?
AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO GO HOME,
SIT YOURSELF DOWN AND ASK "WHERE IS THIS GOING?
YOU'VE MET MY ENTIRE FAMILY,
THEY THINK OF YOU AS THEIR OWN SON." (LAUGHTER) AND YOU'LL BE LIKE "COULD WE
PLEASE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS NOW?
I'M TRYING TO WATCH GAME OF THRONES, GIVE ME SOME SPACE!
WE'RE TOGETHER 24/7 FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
YOU'RE SMOTHERING ME, I CAN'T EVEN TAKE A CRAP ALONE!"
"WELL, I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER." "NOT THIS AGAIN!"
"DO YOU EVEN WANT TO HAVE KIDS?" "I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK."
"YES OR NO, TIME TO FISH OR CUT BAIT." "FINE, LET'S GET MARRIED."
BUT IT WOULD NEVER WORK.
AND I KNOW, FOLKS, BECAUSE BACK IN 2006 I HELD A CONTEST TO FIND OUT WHICH OF MY AUDIENCE MEMBERS
WOULD BECOME MRS. COLBERT AND THE ANSWER SURPRISED A LOT OF US.
>> ME?
I'M MRS. COLBERT, TOO?
I'M SO HAPPY!
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE MY WIFE!
>> I NOW I'M A MODERN BRIDE SO I KEPT MY LAST NAME.
(LAUGHTER) AND, HEY, NOBODY LOVES ME MORE THAN I DO BUT SELF-MARRIAGE JUST
DIDN'T SOLVE MY PROBLEMS BECAUSE ONCE YOU MAKE IT OFFICIAL ALL THE PASSION GOES OUT OF IT.
I STOPPED DRESSING UP FOR MYSELF AND LET'S JUST SAY I GOT SUPER BORING IN THE SACK.
SO IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I ANNOUNCE THAT TONIGHT I AM ENTERING A TRIAL SEPARATION FROM MYSELF.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) NO, NO, NO.
THE WAY I SEE IT, FOLKS, IS THAT IF I TRULY LOVE MYSELF I SHOULD LET ME GO.
BUT IF I DON'T COME BACK I WAS NEVER MINE TO BEGIN WITH.
THANK GOD I SIGNED A PRENUP.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
