( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU, NATION.
NATION, FOLKS, OBVIOUSLY YOU
TONIGHT, YOU ARE EXCITED, AND I
AM VERY, VERY EXCITED ABOUT MY
GUEST TONIGHT, STEVE MARTIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK OUT.
IT'S CALLED "AN OBJECT OF
BEAUTY," AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
NEW YORK ART WORLD.
IT IS A TERRIFIC READ...
I AM TOLD.
( LAUGHTER )
AND I'M A HUGE FAN OF STEVE
MARTIN, SO IN HIS HONOR,
TONIGHT'S SHOW WILL BE DEVOTED
ENTIRELY TO THE SUBJECT OF ART.
WARNING: IF I GET PARTICULARLY
INSPIRED, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE
TO POSE NUDE.
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
ART EDITION.
FIRST UP, A WAG OF MY FINGER AT
STEVE MARTIN.
FREE RIDE'S OVER, STEVE.
MARTIN RECENTLY APPEARED AT THE
92nd STREET Y HERE IN NEW YORK
CITY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BOOK OF
HIS ABOUT ART, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
THE LECTURE WAS NOT WELL
RECEIVED.
JIM.
>> STEVE MARTIN FANS ARE NOT
LAUGHING ABOUT HIS PERFORMANCE
AT THE 92nd STREET Y HERE IN
NEW YORK CITY THE OTHER NIGHT.
NOW, THEY BECAME IRATE WHEN
MARTIN KEPT TALKING ABOUT HIS
NEW BOOK, "AN OBJECT OF BEAUTY,"
INSTEAD OF HIS MOVIES.
THE Y HAS AGREED TO REFUND
UNHAPPY FANS $50.
>> Stephen: HOW DARE YOU,
STEVE MARTIN!
WHEN AN AUDIENCE OF
SOPHISTICATED MANHATTANITES
SEES AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR STEVE
MARTIN WITH DEBRA SOLOMON, WHO
AN ART HISTORIAN, THEY EXPECT A
DISCUSSION OF "THE PINK
PANTHER," "IT'S COMPLICATED" AND
"SERGEANT BILKO."
ART.
INSTEAD STEVE MARTIN TALKS ABOUT
THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK HE JUST
WROTE?
COME ON!
IF YOU GO TO SEE STEVE MARTIN IN
2010, YOU WANT TO SEE THE HOT,
FRESH STUFF FROM 1978.
WHERE IS THE ARROW THROUGH THE
HEAD, THE WILD AND CRAZY GUY,
THE SMASHING WATERMELONS, HIS
CLASSIC BITS?
I MYSELF AM A STEVE MARTIN
ORIGINALIST.
EVER SINCE HE STOPPED DOING
MAGIC TRICKS AT MERLIN'S MAGIC
SHOP IN DISNEYLAND, I CONSIDER
HIM A SELL-OUT.
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY
IT -- ARTISTS DO NOT GET TO
EVOLVE.
STEVE MARTIN NEEDS TO STOP BEING
A JERK AND BE "THE JERK."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NEXT...
YEAH.
YES.
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING WITH ME.
( LAUGHTER )
NEXT THE SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL
PORTRAIT GALLERY RECENTLY HOSTED
A VIDEO INSTALLATION CALLED
"FIRE IN MY BELLY" BY ARTIST
DAVID WANNAROVICH, WHO DIED OF
AIDS, AND WHICH BRIEFLY SHOWS
ANTS CRAWLING ON A CRUCIFIX TO
EQUATE THE LONELY SUFFERING OF
CHRIST WITH THE LONELY SUFFERING
OF AIDS PATIENTS.
WELL, LAST WEEK THEY REMOVED THE
PIECE BASED ON THE FINEST
AESTHETIC CRITERA: REPUBLICANS
THREATENED THEIR FUNDING.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
MY HAT TO INCOMING HOUSE
MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR, WHO
SAID OF THE PIECE, "THIS IS AN
OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO OFFEND
CHRISTIANS DURING THE CHRISTMAS
SEASON.
THE MUSEUM SHOULD PULL THE
EXHIBIT AND BE PREPARED FOR
SERIOUS QUESTIONS COME BUDGET
TIME."
OF COURSE, THIS DREW ALL KINDS
OF FIRE FROM ART CRITICS WHO, NO
SURPRISE, JUST DON'T GET
CANTOR'S WORK.
THIS DEFUNDING THREAT ISN'T SOME
CHEAP EXERCISE IN MINDLESS
CENSORSHIP.
IT'S AN ANTI-PARADIGMATIC
REVOLUTIONARY WORK OF CONCEPTUAL
ART BANNING.
( LAUGHTER )
AND WHILE ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE
MAY BE SENATOR JESSE HELMS'
ADMITTEDLY GROUNDBREAKING
DEFUNDING OF THE NATIONAL
ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS OVER
ANDRE SERRANO'S "PISS CHRIST,"
IT'S NOT A DERIVATIVE "OH, I'M A
CHRISTIAN, I'M OFFENDED,"
BECAUSE AS THE ONLY JEWISH
REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS, CANTOR'S
OUTRAGE ON BEHALF OF CHRISTIANS
AND CHRISTMAS IS A LIMNAL
JOURNEY INTO THE CULTURAL
UR-WOUND, EXPLODING OUR NARROW
PRECONCEPTIONS OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO PANDER.
( LAUGHTER )
HE POSITS: "IN A
POST-METAPHYSICAL WORLD, IS
THERE RECOURSE TO
INTERSUBJECTIVE MEANING?"
SANS ARTIFICE, EACH IDENTITY IS
JUST A SENSELESSLY
DIFFERENTIATED ITERATION OF
ROUTINIZED TROPES.
BUT CANTOR'S META-REIFICATION
MIRRORS OUR OWN INCONTROVERTIBLE
PASSIVITY, WHICH IS THRUST BACK
UPON US, REFRAMED, AND IN A
HABERMASSIAN TWIST, WE REALIZE
THE FINAL AFFIRMATIVE GESTURE OF
HIS SOLIPSISTIC NEGATION.
THUS, CANTOR'S ART IS ABOUT THE
ART THAT ISN'T THERE, MAKING THE
INACCESSIBLE LITERALLY
INACCESSIBLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OR MAYBE HE'S JUST TOO HIP FOR
THE ROOM.
( LAUGHTER )
ANYWAY, GOOD JOB SHUTTING DOWN
THE SMITHSONIAN, SIR.
COINCIDENTALLY, NEXT TIP OF THE
HAT GOES TO THE SMITHSONIAN FOR
MAKING ROOM IN THEIR COLLECTION
FOR A NEW MASTERPIECE -- ME.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION'S
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN
HISTORY HAS ASKED ME TO DONATE
AN ARTIFACT FROM MY HISTORIC
RALLY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW FIRST, FIRST, I OFFERED THEM
OZZIE OSBORNE, BUT EVIDENTLY HE
DOESN'T HAVE ALL HIS SHOTS.
( LAUGHTER )
INSTEAD THE MUSEUM IS ASKING ME
TO DONATE MY VIBRANT AND
UNNERVINGLY SNUG STARS AND
STRIPES JUMPSUIT.
HERE IT IS.
HERE IT IS SHOWING OFF MY OLD
SEVEN-TEN SPLIT.
( LAUGHTER )
AND HERE IT IS RIGHT HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT IS THE PERFECT THING FOR THE
SMITHSONIAN'S TREASURES OF
AMERICAN HISTORY COLLECTION
BECAUSE IT'S MADE IN CHINA.
( LAUGHTER )
PERSONALLY, I HOPE THIS ENDS UP
IN THE SMITHSONIAN'S HALL OF ONE
PIECES NEXT TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S
FOOTY PAJAMAS, TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S
HUNTING ONESIE AND DICK CHENEY'S
GEORGE BUSH SUIT.
HERE NOW TO OFFICIALLY RECEIVE
MY JUMPSUIT, PLEASE WELCOME THE
DIRECTOR OF THE SMITHSONIAN
INSTITUTION'S NATIONAL MUSEUM OF
AMERICAN HISTORY, MR. BRENT
GLASS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SIR, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THERE IT IS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL THROW IN THE BOOTS.
I'LL THROW IN THE BOOTS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'D THROW IN THE
UNDERWEAR IF I HAD BEEN WEARING
ANY.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT DO I GOT TO DO HERE?
>> WE HAVE A DEED OF GIFT HERE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
I'M GETTING BIG CASH FOR THIS,
RIGHT?
>> YES, THE SAME AS...
>> Stephen: PORTRAIT?
I'M STILL WAITING FOR THAT
CHECK.
I DO JUST DATE IT OR DO THE
LAWYERS DO ALL THAT?
CAN I JUST ASK ONE THING?
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
THIS IS POLYESTER.
IT SHOULD NOT BE STORED NEAR AN
OPEN FLAME.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
IS THIS OFFICIAL NOW?
>> IT'S OFFICIAL NOW.
I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT
WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT THE
PORTRAIT OF STEPHEN THAT YOU
GAVE US TWO YEARS AGO IS GOING
BACK ON DISPLAY AT THE MUSEUM OF
AMERICAN HISTORY ON DECEMBER
26th.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
THAT'S THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS
PRESENT AMERICA'S EVER GOTTEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY
JUMPSUIT, MY PORTRAIT ALL AT THE
MUSEUM.
>> OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
>> Stephen: THE MUSEUM OF
AMERICAN HISTORY IN WASHINGTON,
D.C., ON THE MALL.
THANK YOU, SIR.
