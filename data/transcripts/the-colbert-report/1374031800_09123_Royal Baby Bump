LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BASED ON
WHAT I JUST HEARD, I CERTAINLY
HOPE NONE OF YOU EVER STOP
MAKING YOUR MUSIC.

YOU CAN SING.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,
YOU KNOW THAT I AM A PROUD
AMERICAN.
EVERY DAY I THANK GOD THAT THIS
COUNTRY THREW OFF THE YOLK OF
BRITISH TYRANNY.
WE BOW TO NO KING.
LET THE PATRIOT BLOODSHED ON THE
FIELDS OF LEXINGTON AND CONCORDE
NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND SO OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT:
ROYAL BABY BUMP.
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK, SHE IS SO RADIANT.
JIM?
>> COULD TODAY BE THE DAY THAT
THE THIRD DIRECT HEIR TO THE
BRITISH THRONE MAKES HIS OR HER
DEBUT?
>> IT'S WEEK 3 AND THE WORLD IS
LITERALLY WAITING ON EDGE FOR
KATE TO GO INTO LABOR.
>> THE GREAT KATE WAIT.
CONTINUES.
>> WILL IT BE A GIRL OR A BOY?
LONDON IS SWELTERING IN A
HEAT WAVE BUT THAT HASN'T PUT
OFF THE WORLD'S MEDIA OR THE
TOURISTS.
>> HERE AT THE HOSPITAL IT'S
NOTHING SHORT OF A BABY
STAKEOUT.
>> THE U.K. IS ABUZZ WITH
EXCITEMENT.
LOOK, THE U.S. IS ABUZZ WITH
EXCITEMENT.
THE WHOLE WORLD IS ABUZZ WITH
EXCITEMENT.
>> Stephen: THE WHOLE WORLD IS
ABUZZ.
THE WHOLE GALAXY IS IS ABECAUSE.
KATE THE GREAT IS THREE DAYS
LATE.
I JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR HER TO
DILATE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN WHEN AND WHEN?
I MEAN, WHEN WILL THE HEIR TO
THE CROWN BEGIN TO CROWN?
I MEAN, WAIT, WAIT, WHAT AM I
THINKING?
THE BRITS USE METRIC SO NINE
MONTHS THERE MIGHT BE TEN KILO
WEEKS OVER HERE.
WHEN WILL THAT BABY GET HERE?
WHAT WILL PIPPA WEAR?
WILL THE OBSTETRICIAN WEAR A
GIANT HAT?
WHO WILL HAVE LESS HAIR, THE
BABY OR PRINCE WILLIAM?
I'M SO EXCITED.
BREATHE, STEPHEN.
JUST BREATHE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I JUST GOT TO... PICK A SPOT ON
THE WALL AND FOCUS.
I NEED ICE CHIPS.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
I MEAN I CANNOT GET ENOUGH.
I HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE LATEST
SCOOPS.
I MEAN, "U.S. WEEKLY" HAS A
SPECIAL REPORTS IN AN EXCLUSIVE
THAT PADDINGTON BEAR WILL BE IN
THE ROOM SAYS A SOURCE.
YES, PADDING TON.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER BELOVED
BRITISH CHILDREN'S CHARACTER HE
LIKE WINNIE-THE-POOH OR SID
VICIOUS?
I NEED TO KNOW.
OH, GOD, AND THE PAGEANTRY.
YOU KNOW THE HOSPITAL WILL HAVE
THE FINEST HORSE-DRAWN GURNEY,
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE
CHANGING OF THE GUARDS IN FRONT
OF THE ROYAL BIRTH CANAL AND THE
EPIDURAL ADMINISTERS BY
DUMBLEDORE WHILE ELTON JOHN ON
PIANO PLAYS "PLACENTA IN THE
WIND."
THE QUESTION IS, WILL IT BE A
GIRL OR A BOY OR MAYBE SOMETHING
MAGICAL LIKE A UNICORN OR A
HOBBIT?
WHAT HAS IT GOT IN ITS UTERUS,
