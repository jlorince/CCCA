( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" )
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BEFORE WE START, I WOULD JUST
LIKE TO SAY, ALL OF US ARE
SHOCKED AND SADDENED BY THE
SENSELESS ATTACK IN TUCSON THIS
WEEKEND, WHICH KILLED SIX PEOPLE
AND WOUNDED 14 OTHERS, INCLUDING
CONGRESSWOMAN GARBIELLE
GIFFORDS.
WHILE I NEVER MET REPRESENTATIVE
GIFFORDS, WE HAVE TUSSLED IN THE
MEDIA AND HER HUSBAND MARK IS
THE ASTRONAUT WHO TAUGHT ME HOW
THE LAND THE SPACE SHUTTLE.
TO THE CONGRESSWOMAN, HER
HUSBAND AND THE FAMILIES AND
FRIENDS OF ALL THE VICTIMS OF
THIS HORRIBLE ATTACK, WE AT "THE
REPORT" SEND OUR THOUGHTS AND
PRAY ERS.
WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED
THIS CLEARLY UNBALANCED
INDIVIDUAL, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO LAY BLAME
OF POLITICIZE THIS TRAGEDY.
>> HE WAS OBVIOUSLY A LEFTIST.
HE ADMIRED MEIN KAMPF AND THE
COMMUNIST MANIFESTO.
>> THE TEA PARTY IS DEFINITELY
TOLERANT OF EXTREMISM AND
VIOLENCE.
>> BARACK OBAMA AT ONE POINT
SAID, WILL YOU BRING A
SUBMACHINE GUN?
>> SARAH PALIN HAS BLOOD ON HER
HANDS.
>> HE'S ALSO BEING DESCRIBED AS
A LEFT-WING POLITICAL POT HEAD.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: OH.
I GUESS I'M WRONG.
DID WE PICK SOMEONE TO BLAME
YET?
WELL, GET ON IT.
