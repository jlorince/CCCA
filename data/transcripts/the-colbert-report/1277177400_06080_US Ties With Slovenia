VERY KIND.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, NATION, I
HAVE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE
WORLD CUP EVER SINCE I HEARD THE
U.S. MIGHT WIN A GAME.
[LAUGHTER]
AND LAST WEEK WE CRUSHED ENGLAND
1-1.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, THERE IS NO NEED TO
EMBARRASS ENGLAND BY SHOWING OUR
GOAL AGAIN, BUT I'M GONN OO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CHEW ON, THAT ENGLAND.
WITH YOUR REMAINING, MISALIGNED
TOOTH.
OF COURSE, THE ONLY THING BETTER
THAN BEING THE VICTOR IS BEING
THE VICTIMMENT ON FRIDAY WE WERE
FIGHTING BACK FROM A 2-0 DEFICIT
TO TIE SLOVENIA WHEN THIS GOAL
WAS DISALLOWED BY REFEREE KOMAN
COULIBALY FROM MALI.
YEAH, THE WORST REF SINCE BILLY
SHOBALANA FROM GHANA.
WE HAD TO SETTLE FOR A TIE, 2-2.
WHAT'S THE DEAL, COULIBALY?
HAVE YOU WATCHED SO MUCH SOCCER
THAT YOU'VE LOST THE ABILITY TO
COUNT PAST TWO?
[LAUGHTER]
THIS CALL WAS TOTALLY UNFAIR,
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
AGREES.
>> THE REFEREE GAVE A REAL
INJUSTICE.
>> THEY SHOULD HAVE WON THE
GAME.
>> THEY WOULD HAVE WON IF THE
THIRD GOAL HADN'T BEEN
CONTROVERSIALLY DISALLOWED.
>> THE WORLD HAS SPOKEN.
IN THEIR WEIRD ACCENTS.
[LAUGHTER]
THE U.S. HASN'T FELT THIS MUCH
GLOBAL GOODWILL SINCE 9/11, AND
FOLKS, WE CANNOT LET IT GO TO
WASTE.
IT IS TIME TO INVADE SOMEBODY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW ABOUT MALI?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I KNOW, I KNOW IT IS
POVERTY STRICKEN AND A DESERT,
BUT IT WILL STILL LOOK LIKE A
FAIR FIGHT BECAUSE EVEN IF WE
KICK THEIR ASS, THIS GUY WILL
CAL
