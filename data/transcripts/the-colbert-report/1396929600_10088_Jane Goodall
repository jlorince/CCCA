>> Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHTIS A RENOWNED SCIENTIST WHO
DISCOVERED THAT CHIMPS USETOOLS.
PLEASE WELCOME DAME JANEGOODALL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DR. GOODALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE TO MEETYOU.
I'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN FASCINATEDWITH YOUR WORK SINCE I WAS JUST
A BOY.
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU AS THECHIMPANZEE EXPERT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IF I WERE A CHIMPTHAT YOU WERE MEETING FOR THE
FIRST TIME, WOULD THERE BESOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR
BODY LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW IF YOUWERE MEETING ME FOR THE FIRST
TIME?
IF YOU WERE TREATING ME LIKE ACHIMP, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD BE ITBE?
>> DO YOU WANT TO DEMONSTRATE?
YES, I DO.
RIGHT HERE?
DO I STAND OR -->> YOU STAND.
YOU DO AS I WELL YOU.
OKAY?
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE THE BIG MALE SO YOU'RE
DOMINANT.
YEP, LIKE THAT.
AND I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS OFYOU.
NOW, YOU MUSTN'T MAKE A SOUND,RIGHT?
NO SOUND FROM YOU.
NO, NOTHING.
I MAKE THE SOUND.
SO I JUST GO -- UH, UH, UH, UH,UH -- BUT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE ME,
SO YOU GO UH, UH, UH, UH, UH --(APPLAUSE)
>> ARE WE GOING STEADY NOW?
WE'RE GOING STEADY.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU WORK INTANZANIA AND YOU WORK WITH FLO,
GIGI, FRODO, MIKE AND HUMPHREY.
NOW YOUR BOOK IS CALLED SEEDS OFHOPE, THE WISDOM AND WONDER FROM
THE WORLD OF PLANTS.
WHY GO FROM CHIMPANZEES TOPLANTS?
DID YOU GET BORED?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE SEEN ONE ONROLLER SKATES YOU'VE SEEN THEM
ALL?
>> WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM OFFOF ROLLER SKATES.
>> Stephen: IN THIS JOBMARKET, I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT.
>> I HAD TO LEAVE THE FORESTBECAUSE THE FOREST ACROSS AFRICA
ARE DISAPPEARING AS THEY AREAROUND THE WORLD.
CHIMPANZEE NUMBERS ARE DROPPING.
SO I HAD TO START TALKING ABOUTTHE TERRIBLE THINGS WE'RE DOING
TO THE PLANET.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE WE DOINGTO THE PLANTS?
HOW ARE WE HURTING THEM?
>> EVERY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE.
WE'RE DESTROYING THEM BY CUTTINGDOWN THE FORESTS WHICH RELEASES
CO2 WHICH ADDS TO CLIMATECHANGE.
WE ARE TAKING OVER MORE AND MOREECOSYSTEMS FOR OUR DEVELOPMENTS,
OUR BUILDINGS, OUR SUPERMARKETS.
WE'RE MINING DEEP IN THE FOREST,WE'RE MAKING ROADS FOR THE
HUNTERS TO COME KILL THEANIMALS.
>> Stephen: BUT WE PRODUCE ALOT OF CO2 NOW.
DON'T THE PLANTS USE THAT FORFOOD?
AREN'T WE HELPING THE PLANTS ASMUCH AS HURTING THEM?
>> NO.
AT ONE TIME WE LIVED IN HARMONY,BUT NOW BALANCE, WE'RE RELEASING
FOSSIL FUELS, CUTTING DOWNFORESTS, ADDING TO GREENHOUSE
GASES.
LOOK AT THE CLIMATE.
WE'VE HAD THE WORST WINTER INEASTERN NORTH AMERICA, THE
WETTEST WINTER IN ENGLAND. IPASSED FIELDS WHERE SWANS WERE
FLOATING. THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S NOT SO BEAUTIFUL IF YOU'REA FARMER.
NOT REALLY.
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE THINGTHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT YOUR NEW
STUDIES IS THE THINGS YOU WEREDOING BEFORE WITH CHIMPANZEES,
YOU WERE SEEING THEM ASINDIVIDUALS AND HAVING EMPATHY
FOR THEM.
AM I GOING TO HAVE EMPATHY FORPLANTS NOW?
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FEELGUILTY WHEN I'M, YOU KNOW,
CHOWING DOWN ON AN EAR OF CORNTHIS SUMMER.
>> YOU'LL PROBABLY BE CHEWING ONGENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN
WHICH MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FORYOU IN THE LONG RUN.
SOME OF THESE TREES, WHEN YOUMEET 2,000-YEAR-OLD TREES AND
YOU THINK, MY GOODNESS! WHATHAS IT SEEN? HOW AMAZING!
YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE BARKWITH THE SAP GOING OFF OF IT --
>> Stephen: JANE GOODALL, AREYOU TRYING TO MAKE ME CRY ABOUT
TREES?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU LEARNED EXTRAORDINARY THINGS
ABOUT CHIMPANZEES, THAT THEY'RETOOL USERS.
IN FACT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK ATTHIS LITTLE CLIP THERE.
>> THE CHIMPANZEE IS MODIFYINGAN OBJECT TO SUIT IT TO A
SPECIFIC PURPOSE, THUS MAKING ATOOL.
LEWIS GOT EXTREMELY EXCITED ANDSAID WE HAVE TO REDEFINE MAN,
TOOLS OR INCLUDE CHIMPANZEESWITH HUMANS.
>> Stephen: LOOKS LIKE THATCHIMP IS LAUGHING AT US.
>> PROBABLY IS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ONE OFTHOSE PEOPLE -- AND WHAT WORRIES
ME ABOUT THAT CLIP, ARE YOU ONEOF THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVES IN
THIS EVOLUTION GAME?
(LAUGHTER)ALL YOUR YEARS OF LIVING WITH
CHIMPS, DID YOU SEE ONE OF THEMEVOLVE INTO A MAN?
FALL OUT OF A TREE, HAIR COMESOFF, PUTS ON A TIE, HE'S A MAN?
JUST ONE, AND I'M ON BOARD.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: EVER HAPPEN?
I'M AFRAID YOU WILL NEVER BEABLE TO JOIN ME ON THIS BAND
WAGON.
>> Stephen: OH, WELL, THAT'STOO BAD.
>> THAT'S TOO BAD.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE WE'REGOING STEADY.
>> WELL, YOU JUST BLEW IT.
