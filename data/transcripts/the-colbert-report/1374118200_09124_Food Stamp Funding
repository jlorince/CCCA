DOWN THERE.
AND LAST WEEK, JUST LAST WEEK
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PROVED
THAT THEY ARE NOT DO-NOTHINGS BY
DONE DIDDING SOMETHING.
THEY PASSEDDED THE FARM BILL.
NOW, THAT MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE
MUCH.
TRADITIONALLY THE FARM BILL IS A
ROUTINE PIECE OF LEGISLATION
WHICH PROVIDES GOVERNMENT
SUBSIDIES FOR FARMERS WHILE ALSO
SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR FOOD
STAMPS.
IT'S A WIN-WIN.
HELP FOR THE FOLKS WHO GROW THE
CORN AND HELP FOR FOLKS WHO LIVE
ON NOTHING BUT CORN SYRUP.
NOW THE HOUSE HAD NOT PASSED A
FARM BILL IN TWO YEARS BECAUSE
60 HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMANDED
DEEP CAN YOUS IN FOOD STAMPS.
BUT LAST WEEK HOUSE REPUBLICANS
AGREED TO AN HISTORIC COMPROMISE
ON FOOD STAMPS BY ELIMINATING
THE FOOD STAMPS.
JIM?
>> THE U.S. HOUSE NARROWLY
PASSEDDED A SCALED-DOWN FARM
BILL AFTER DROPPING FOOD STAMPS
FROM THE MEASURE.
FOOD STAMPS CAN WAIT BUT FARM
PROGRAMS CANNOT.
>> Stephen: YES, FARM PROGRAMS
CANNOT WAIT.
WE NEED TO GROW THE FOOD THAT
PEOPLE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO
BUY.
SEE, REPUBLICANS SHOWED THEY
WERE WILLING TO COMPROMISE BY
ELIMINATING THE PART OF THE BILL
THEY REFUSED TO COMPROMISE ON.
IT'S JUST LIKE A CARDIOLOGIST
WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH A
PATIENT'S HEART.
INSTEAD OF GETTING BOGGED DOWN
IN COMPLICATED PROCEDURES HE
SIMPLY REMOVES THE HEART.
PROBLEM SOLVED.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THE BEST PART... THE BEST PART,
THAT PATIENT NO LONGER NEEDS
FOOD STAMPS.
AND WITHOUT THIS GOVERNMENT
HANDOUT, HE IS MOTIVATED TO
WORK.
IT KEEPS HIM HUNGRY FOR SUCCESS
AND, OF COURSE, FOOD.
NOW THE G.O.P. BREAKTHROUGH DID
NOT SATISFY MAINSTREAM MEDIA
STOMACH GRUMBLERS LIKE CBS
SENIOR ROOT VEGETABLE BOB
SCHEIFFER.
>> YOU PASS A FARM BILL IN THE
HOUSE THAT GIVES BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, MUCH OF IT TO LARGE
CORPORATIONS THAT OWN FARMS.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WELFARE FOR THE
WEALTHY.
BUT YOU DON'T INCLUDE A DOLLAR
FOR HUNGRY PEOPLE FOR FOOD
STAMPS.
WHAT KIND OF A MESSAGE IS THAT?
>> Stephen: I'LL TAKE THAT ONE,
BOB.
IT IS A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE
MESSAGE BASED ON THE OLD ADAGE,
GIVE A MAN A FISH, HE'LL EAT FOR
A DAY.
TAKE AWAY HIS FOOD STAMPS AND
HE'LL FOUND FISH-CO, A
MULTINATIONAL SEAFOOD
CONGLOMERATE THAT GETS A MASSIVE
SUBSIDY IN THE NEXT FARM BILL.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BESIDES, FOLKS, LET'S BE CLEAR.
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT OGRES.
ALTHOUGH IF WE CAN FIND A CHEAP
WAY TO GRIND BONES INTO BREAD,
THEY'RE WILLING TO LISTEN.
THEY JUST UNDERSTAND THAT
PROVIDING SUBSIST ENS NUTRITION
TRAPS PEOPLE IN A STATE OF
POVERTY AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
IS IT, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
MIKE KELLY?
>> THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT AMERICAN.
THAT'S NOT WAY WE WORKED IN THE
PAST.
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR FUTURE
SHOULD HOLD FOR US.
IT SHOULD BE ONE OF BLUE SKIES
AND STRONG WINDS AT OUR BACKS IN
A NATION THAT HAS EVERYTHING
THAT GOD COULD POSSIBLY PROVIDE
FOR US.
WE HAVE TILLABLE SOIL AND
POTABLE WATER.
AS FAR AS PROVIDING FOOD FOR
PEOPLE, MY GOODNESS, WE
SHOULDN'T BE VULNERABLE IN THIS
COUNTRY ANY PLACE.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WE DON'T NEED
FOOD STAMPS.
AMERICA'S BLESSED BLUE SKIES AND
STRONG WINDS AND TILLABLE SOIL
AND POTABLE WATER NOT TO MENTION
EDIBLE SOIL AND DRUM STICK
WRAPPERS WITH CHOCOLATE NUTS
STUCK ON THEM.
THERE'S THE OLD MAN IN THE PARK
WHO JUST GIVES AWAY BREAD
CRUMBS.
HOW HARD COULD IT BE TO ELBOW A
PIGEON OUT OF THE WAY AND PECK
YOUR WAY TO A FULL STOMACH?
PLUS FOOD STAMPS JUST TURNS
BEING POOR INTO SOME SORT OF
POORGASBOARD.
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO STAY HOME
AND NOT WORK WHEN YOU CAN RAKE
IN AN AVERAGE OF AN $134 A MONTH
FOR FOOD.
THAT'S ALMOST ONE $5 FOOT LONG A
DAY.
THREE INCHES FOR BREAKFAST.
FOUR INCHES FOR LUNCH.
FIVE INCHES FOR DINNER.
FOR DESSERT, THE PLASTIC BAG.
DON'T WORRY, FOLKS.
DO NOT WORRY.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE ABSOLUTELY
GOING TO PASS FUNDING FOR FOOD
STAMPS AT SOME POINT.
AND WHEN THEY DON'T, IF PEOPLE
ARE STILL HUNGRY, WE'LL JUST
COMBINE THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM
WITH THE IMMIGRATION PROGRAM AND
LET POOR PEOPLE EAT MEXICANS.
THE BEST PART IS, THE BEST PART
IS, THEY ARE A HEALTHY SNACK
BECAUSE THEY PICK THEIR OWN
VEGETABLES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
