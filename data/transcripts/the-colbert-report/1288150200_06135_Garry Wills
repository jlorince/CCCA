MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PULITZER
PRIZE-WINNING HISTORIAN WHOSE
NEW BOOK IS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL.
IT BETTER BE AUTHORIZED.
PLEASE WELCOME GARY WILLS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
MR. WILLS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING BACK ON.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NOW, WE HAD YOU ON ONCE BEFORE
TO TALK ABOUT HOW AMERICAN
POLITICS AND THE AMERICAN WAY OF
LIFE ARE AFFECTED.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN: ADVENTURES
OF AN OBSERVER.
FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON
WRITING A BOOK ABOUT YOURSELF.
( LAUGHTER )
>> NO, IT'S ABOUT MUCH MORE
INTERESTING PEOPLE, BEVERLY
SILLS, BILL BUCKLEY, A WHOLE
RANGE OF PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'S YOUR
MEMOIR OF THESE PEOPLE, CORRECT?
>> WELL, IT'S WHAT I OBSERVED OF
THEM, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHY "OUTSIDE
LOOKING IN"?
WHY NOT "INSIDE MESSING STUFF
UP"?
THAT'S WHAT THE REAL ACTORS IN
HISTORY DO.
YOU'RE AN HISTORIAN.
DON'T YOW WANT TO BE AN AGENT OF
HISTORY?
>> NEW YORK I DON'T.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT?
YOU AFRAID SOMEONE WILL WRITE A
BOOK ABOUT YOU?
>> JIM FALLOWS ONCE ASKED ME WHY
I DIDN'T JOIN THE JIMMY CARTER
CAMPAIGN AS HE DID, AND I SAID,
I'M AN END METEOROLOGIST, WHICH
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO BECOME A
BUG.
>> Stephen: I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
( APPLAUSE )
YOU ARE ALSO AN HISTORIAN.
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT LINCOLN.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN WILL BE ON
THE SHOW NEXT WEEK.
SHE'S ALSO AN HISTORIAN AND AN
EXPERT ON LINCOLN.
IF YOU WERE IN A FIGHT, WHO
WOULD WIN?
IF YOUR LINCOLN FOUGHT HERLIN
CON, WHO WOULD WIN?
>> SHE WOULD WIN BECAUSE I'M HER
DISCIPLE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
YOU'RE A DISCIPLE OF HER?
YOU'RE ALSO A DISCIPLE OF
WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
BUCKLEY WOULD MAKE OF THE TEA
PARTY?
>> HE HAD A WORD HE LIKED TO USE
FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT,
"VULGARIANS."
>>
>> Stephen: NOW IS THAT... HE
HAD A GREAT VOCABULARY.
IS THAT NECESSARILY A PEJORATIVE
OR...
>> YOU'LL THINK SO IF YOU'RE
CALLED THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD BE THE
VULGARIAN ASPECT OF THE TEA
PARTY.
THEY WANT LOWER TAXES AND
SMALLER GOVERNMENT.
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT WHEN
GEORGE BUSH WAS IN.
THE SAME GRIEVANCES WERE THERE.
>> Stephen: THINGS CHANGED
AFTER WE LEFT OFFICE.
>> THEY CERTAINLY DID.
WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.
THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S SAYING THE
TEA PARTY IS A RACIST ENDEAVOR.
>> OF COURSE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: NOT OF COURSE.
I MEAN, THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE
WHO ARE BLACK WHO HAVE BEEN TO
TEA
TEA PARTIES.
>> YES, AND THEY WORE THE MAD
HAT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUTSIDE
LOOKING IN ON OUR HISTORY, ARE
WE AS DIVIDED NOW AS WE HAVE
EVER BEEN IN OUR AMERICAN
HISTORY?
>> NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THE CIVIL WAR HAD A SEPARATE
COUNTRY INSIDE OUR COUNTRY.
THAT WAS MORE DIVIDED.
>> Stephen: I'LL GRANT YOU
THAT.
I'LL GRANT YOU THAT.
WE'RE NOT SHOOTING EACH OTHER
YET.
WE'RE NOT SHOOTING EACH OTHER
YET.
IF WE WERE TO HAVE ANOTHER CIVIL
WAR RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD BE OUR
SLAVERY?
WHAT WOULD BE THE ISSUE THAT
WOULD DIVIDE US AS A COUNTRY?
>> MUSLIMS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: SO WHO IS GOING TO
FIGHT FOR THE MUSLIMS IN THE
UNITED STATES?
SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT THEY
SHOULD HAVE RIGHTS, BUT NOBODY'S
SAYING, THAT'S MY BUDDY.
>> PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THE
CONSTITUTION WILL FIGHT FOR
MUSLIMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE
SAME RIGHTS AS YOU AND I.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU KNOW THEY
ATTACKED US ON 9/11.
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T.
>> Stephen: EXCUSE ME.
DON'T APPLAUD BEFORE I NAIL HIM.
APPLAUD AFTER I NAIL HIM.
THEY ATTACKED US ON 9/11.
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY DID.
THEY WERE ALL SWLOIMS ATTACKED
US ON 9/11.
CHECK AND MATE.
LOOK AT ALL THE MUSLIMS WHO
DIDN'T ATTACK US ON NEFERL.
>> THEY WERE IN MEETINGS.
>> THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE
MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE ONES WHO
DID.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A NOTED
INTELLECTUAL.
AMERICA IS NOT A BIG FAN
GENERALLY.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT HUGE
FANS OF THE "SMARTY PANTS."
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON
THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN ON
AMERICA ITSELF?
>> NO.
( LAUGHTER ) I'M A MIDWESTERN
RUBE.
SO I FIT IN VERY WELL.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
A RUBE?
COULD I SELL DO YOU BROOKLYN
BRIDGE WHEN YOU'RE IN TOWN?
>> YOU HIGH.
>> Stephen: YOU WROTE ABOUT
NIXON.
COULD OBAMA, COULD BARACK OBAMA
LEARN ANYTHING FROM RICHARD
NIXON?
>> I HOPE HE WILL LEARN NOT TO
BE NUTTY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: BUT NIXON WAS AN
INTELLECTUAL AND OBAMA IS AN
INTELLECTUAL, AND PEOPLE DON'T
LIKE OBAMA BECAUSE HE SEEMS LIKE
TOO MUCH OF A SMARTY PANTS AND
NIXON WAS ABLE TO HIDE IT.
>> HE CERTAINLY DID.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELL, THE BOOK IS
"ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN."
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND
LETTING US LOOK AT YOU.
GARY WILLS,
