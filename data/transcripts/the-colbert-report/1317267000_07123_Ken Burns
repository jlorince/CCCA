EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW
THREE-PART DOCUMENTARY ABOUT
PROHIBITION.
INSTEAD OF INTERVIEWING HIM, WE
WILL PAN SLOWLY ACROSS HIS FACE
WHILE I PLAY A MOURNFUL FLUTE.
PLEASE WELCOME KEN BURNS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.
LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL
ANYBODY IN THE WORLD WHO KEN
BURNS IS, MAN.
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
HAVE YOU BEEN TO GEORGE
CLOONEY'S VILLA?
>> NEW YORK BUT I DID HAVE A
DRINK WITH HIM THE OTHER DAY.
>> Stephen: DID YOU REALLY?
DID YOU KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON?
>> WE DIDN'T JUMP IN.
IT WAS COLD IN THE MOUNTAINS OF
COLORADO.
>> THE SHRINKY-DINK.
>> YOU'VE GOT A NEW THREE-PART
DOCUMENTARY.
IT STARTS THIS SUNDAY.
SUNDAY, MONDAY AND TUESDAY AT
8:00 P.M. ON CBS.
IT'S CALLED PROHIBITION.
>>PROHIBITION WAS STARTED IN 1920.
>> BEFORE '33.
>> HOW DRUNK WAS AMERICA BEFORE
PROHIBITION?
>> SO DRUNK.
WE DRANK THREE TIMES THE
QUANTITY THAT WE DANK.
THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE...
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH WOULD A
MAN DRINK IN A YEAR?
>> 90 BOTTLES PER CAPITA.
BUT WOMEN DIDN'T DRINK, SO MAYBE
180.
>> HOW SWEET.
>> WE HAD A SALOON CULTURE, AND
PEOPLE WERE LAID OUT, FAMILIES
WERE IN DISTRESS AND THEY
DECIDED OVER THE COURSE OF THE
19th CENTURY WAS THAT THE
BEST THING TO DO WAS TO TAKE THE
PROBLEM THAT 10% OF THE PROBLEM
WAS TO APPLY IT TO 100% OF THE
PEOPLE.
TO HAVE THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO
THE CONSTITUTION THAT LIMITS
HUMAN FREEDOM AND THE ONLY ONE
THANK GOODNESS THAT WAS
REPEALED.
>> Stephen: NOW SPECIFICALLY,
WHAT DID THE AMENDMENT SAY AND
WHAT DID THE VOLSTAD ACT DO?
WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF IT?
>> WELL, THE AMENDMENT SAID YOU
CAN'T MANUFACTURE, SELL AND
TRANSPORT ALCOHOL, AND THE
VOLSTAD ACT, WHICH WAS PUT INTO
EFFECT TO DEFINE ALCOHOL AS ONE
HALF OF ONE%, SO THAT MEANT THAT
GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE WAS
ILLEGAL.
BUT THERE WERE SO MANY LOOPHOLES
THAT YOU COULD DRIVE A
PROHIBITION TRUCK THROUGH AND
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: AMERICA LOVES
THEIR FREEDOM AND THEY CLEARLY
LOVE THEIR BOOZE.
WHY DO WE LET PEOPLE TAKE AWAY
OUR FREEDOM.
>> THIS IS A REALLY, REALLY GOOD
QUESTION.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: BY THE TIME IT
WENT INTO EFFECT, EVERYBODY
SEEMED TO WANT IT.
THE KU KLUX KLAN WANTED IT, BUT
SO DID THE NAACP.
>> Stephen: STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
WITH ONLY ONE BED SHEET.
SO PROGRESSIVES WANTED IT.
SO DID CONSERVATIVES.
THE INDUSTRIALISTS WANTED IT.
SO DID THE WOBBLIES.
THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD, THE
RADICAL LABOR UNION, THEY WANTED
IT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT ALCOHOL
WAS A FLAW THAT WEAKENED THE
WORKING MAN.
EVERYBODY WANTED IT, BUT IT WAS
PROHIBITION FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
THIS IS A STORY OF SINGLE-ISSUE
CAMPAIGNS THAT PASSED WITH
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
THE DEMONIZATION OF IMMIGRANTS,
THE LOSS OF A CIVIL DISCOURSE.
>> Stephen: HOW COULD WE
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND A POLITICAL
SYSTEM LIKE THAT?
>> YEAH.
WELL, IT GETS EVEN BETTER.
THERE WAS A WHOLE GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY LOST
CONTROL OF THEIR COUNTRY AND
COULDN'T TAKE IT BACK.
DO YOU KNOW ACLIEWZ YAS SEIZE
19?
THERE'S NOTHING NEW UNDER THE
SUN.
>> Stephen: DID WE REALLY STOP
DRINKING?
>> NO.
IT ACTUALLY DID GO DOWN FOR A
TIME AND CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER
DECLINED AND DRUNK DRIVING
ACCIDENTS DECLINED.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY...
>> THAT'S THE THING.
IT COINCIDED WITH THE MASS
DISTRIBUTION OF CARS.
SO EVERYBODY NOW HAD A CAR.
SO THIS WAS ALREADY A SERIOUS
PROBLEM.
BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO
CONTINUED DRINKING, WHO LOVE THE
SPEAK EASY CULTURE, WHO LOVE THE
IDEA OF SOLICITOUS BOOZE DRANK
MORE AND THERE WAS BINGE
DRINKING AND WOMEN WERE
DRINKING.
>> Stephen: WHY WERE WOMEN
DRINKING?
BECAUSE THEY LOVED THE BAD BOYS?
WHY?
>> OUR GRAND FORECASTER AND OUR
GREAT GRANDMOTHERS WERE DOING
STUFF WE THINK ONLY WE INVENTED.
>> Stephen: YOU SHUT YOUR
MOUTH.
[LAUGHTER]
THOSE WOMEN WERE SAINTS.
THEY WERE SAINTS.
[APPLAUSE]
I WAS CONCEIVED THROUGH A FIRM
HANDSHAKE.
>> IMMACULATE.
>> SO WHAT GOT RID OF IT.
>> WHAT GOT RID OF IT WAS THE
HYPOCRISY.
THEY SKATED AROUND IT WHEF THEY
WANTED.
THEY COULD STOCKPILE IT.
THE DEPRESSION CAME.
IT REMINDED ME WHY WE ENDED THE
FIFTH LARGEST INDUSTRY IN
AMERICA, THE TEAMSTER, THE
BARREL MAKERS, THE WAITERS.
YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER THE
CULTURE WAR, THE MORAL
IMPERATIVE THAT THEY
ABSOLUTELY... THE MORAL
ABSOLUTISM OF PROHIBITION.
THEY REFUSED TO COMPROMISE.
WE MAY STILL HAVE A VERSION OF
PROHIBITION IF THEY HAD BEEN
WILLING TO COMPROMISE.
BUT SINGLE-ISSUE CAMPAIGNS ARE
GRABBED AHOLD BY PEOPLE WHO ARE
CERTAIN THEY'RE RIGHT.
THERE IS NO COMPROMISE.
NOTHING BUT MORE ENFORCEMENT.
BY THAT TIME THE GANGSTER
CULTURE, WE CREATED THE
INVISI-GUARD THE ENDED
CONSEQUENCE, WE CREATED
ORGANIZED CRIME.
WE WOULD NOT HAVE ORGANIZED
CRIME HAD THERE NOT BEEN
PROHIBITION.
>> WITHOUT ANY ORGANIZED CRIME,
THERE WOULD BE NO CAREER FOR
ROBERT DE NIRO.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Stephen: KEN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: KEN BURN,
"PROHIBITION" BEGINS AIRING
SUNDAY NIGHT AT 8:00 ON PBS, AND
THE DVD GOES ON SALE STARTING
NEXT WEEK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
