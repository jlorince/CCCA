OUT WITH A BROOM HANDLE.
NATION, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS
AMERICA DANGLING BY A THREAD.
WE'RE LIKE A GIANT PINATA THAT
MEXICANS ARE HITTING UNTIL WE
BUST OPEN AND ALL OUR JOBS FELL
OUT.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THIS WEEK OUR COUNTRY'S
MOST FAMOUS IMMIGRANT, BARACK
OBAMA, AND I HOPE I PRONOUNCED
THAT NAME CORRECTLY, HE IS TOOK
A HALF-HEARTED SWIPE AT THE
PROBLEM.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED A NEW
$600 MILLION BORDER ENFORCEMENT
BILL THAT SENDS 1,500 NEW AGENTS
TO THE SOUTHWEST BORDER AND PAYS
FOR MORE UNMANNED DRONES TO
PATROL IT.
>> Stephen: BIG WHOOP.
WE'VE GOT 140,000 TROOPS IN
AFGHANISTAN AND THAT PLACE IS
STILL CRAWLING WITH FOREIGNERS.
NOW, THERE ARE A FEW PRACTICAL
IDEAS TO CONTROL THE BORDER OUT
THERE, LIKE THIS ONE FROM RANSD
PAUL.
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY
PUT AN ELECTRONIC FENCE UNDER
THE WHOLE BORDERMENT
>> Stephen: YEAH, AN ELECTRIC
FENCE UNDER THE BORDER.
WE JUST NEED TO GET THE MEXICANS
TO WEAR THOSE DOG SHOCK COLLARS.
THEN...
[APPLAUSE]
IT WOULD WORK.
IT'S HUMANE.
IT'S HUMANE.
AND THEN THERE'S THOSE WHACK JOB
SUGGESTIONS LIKE WHY DON'T YOU
JUST STOP HIRING THEM AND
THEY'LL STOP COMING HERE.
COME ON!
THEY'RE SO CHEAP.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEY REALLY DO THE JOB.
LIKE DRUGS.
HAVE YOU EVER DONE A LINE OF
CHEAP IMMIGRANT LABOR?
WOO, LET'S PROCESS SOME CHICKEN.
WOO, LET'S MULCH A FLOWER BED,
[BLEEPED].
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED
HAS BEEN FRUITLESS, WHICH IS A
SHAME, BECAUSE THESE GUYS CAN
PICK FRUIT LIKE NOBODY'S
BUSINESS.
SO WE NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE
BOX, AND THAT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S "WORD."
BORDERLINE PERSONALITY.
FOLKS, ALL THE BEST IMMIGRATION
IDEAS COME FROM ARIZONA AND FROM
ONE MAN, SHERIFF JOE ARAPAIO.
>> LIKE THE LAWMEN OF THE OLD
WEST, MARICOPA COUNTY ARIZONA
SHERIFF JOE ARAPAIO ISN'T AFRAID
OF MUCH.
>> FOR THOSE WHO WANT A TOUGH
CRACK YOUR ON ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS, HE IS A HERO.
>> THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO
NONSENSE ABOUT YOU, WHICH I
LOVE.
YOU ARE AMERICA'S TOUGHEST
SHERIFF.
>> Stephen: AMERICA EASE --
AMERICA'S TOUGHEST SHERIFF WAS
THE REALITY SHOW I BELIEVE JOE
ARAPAIO WON, ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T
FARE WELL ON ""AMERICA'S NEXT
COP MODEL"."
HE PRESENTED HIS SOLUTION TO THE
ARIZONA TEA PARTY STANDING RIGHT
NEXT TO THE MEXICAN BORDER
FENCE.
>> WHY DON'T WE PUT THE BORDER
PATROL ACROSS THE FENCE ON THAT
SIDE?
WE'LL CLEAN UP THE MESS IN A
MONTH.
>> I BET THE BORDER PATROL COULD
CLEAN UP THAT MESS IN LESS THAN
A MONTH.
THE POINT IS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR OUR BORDER PATROL TO COVER
HUNDREDS OF MILES OF ARIZONA
DESERT.
BUT LOOK AT THE MEXICAN SIDE.
THAT ONE WOULD BE AS EASY AS
ONE, TWO, THREE.
AND ONCE THEY GET INTO MEXICO,
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A COUNTRY
BRISTLING WITH MEXICANS.
ROAMING FREE ON THE TECHNICALITY
THAT THEY'RE STILL IN MEXICO.
SO THEY'LL JUST... I THINK WHAT
THEY'RE GOING TO DO HERE IS
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GRAB THESE
PRE-ILLEGALS, TAKE THEM TO THE
U.S., DEMAND TO SEE THEIR PAPERS
AND WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THEM,
WE DEPORT THEM OUT OF THE LAND
OF OPPORTUNITY BACK TO MEXICO.
OF COURSE, MEXICANS ARE GOING TO
TRY EVEN HARDER TO SNEAK BACK
INTO THE UNITED STATES.
I MEAN, WHO WOULD WANT TO STAY
IN MEXICO?
IT'S BEING INVADED.
NOW, WE'RE CLEARLY NOT GOING TO
GET ANY HELP FROM THEIR
GOVERNING PARTY.
I LOOKED INTO IT.
AND I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING DOWN.
THE WHOLE PLACE IS RUN BY
MEXICANS.
FOLKS, THIS...
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, THIS, THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET THOSE
PEOPLE INTO YOUR COUNTRY.
I MEAN, IS MEXICO GOING THE LIKE
HAVING ARMED AMERICANS STREAMING
ACROSS THEIR BORDER?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SNEAK
'EM IN.
I'M NOT SURE HOW.
MAYBE WE CAN STUFF THEM IN THE
QUARTER ANIMALS OF AN OLD PICKUP
TRUCK OR THEY CAN DIG A SYSTEM
OF TUNNELS UNDER THE BORDER
FENCE.
THE POINT IS, I KNOW, I KNOW WE
CAN DO IT.
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING
WE'VE LEARNED, IT'S THAT WITH A
2,000-MILE BORDER, THERE'S
REALLY NO WAY THEY CAN STOP US.
