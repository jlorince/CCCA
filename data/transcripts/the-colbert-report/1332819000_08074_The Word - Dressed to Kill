LET'S JUST SAY A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME.
NOW FOLKS, IT IS NEVER EASY TO TALK ABOUT TRAGEDY BUT THE DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN IN
FLORIDA HAS DOMINATED THE NEWS FOR THE LAST WEEK.
>> 17-YEAR-OLD TRAYVON MARTIN WAS SHOT AND KILLED.
HE WAS WALKING TOWARDS HIS FATHER'S HOME IN A GATED COMMUNITY.
HE WAS CARRYING A BAG OF SKITTLES AND AN ICED TEA.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAPTAIN GEORGE ZIMMERMAN SAYS HE SHOT THE TEEN IN SELF-DEFENCE.
>> GEORGE ZIMMERMAN SAID HE SPOTTED WHAT HE CALLED A SUSPICIOUS BLACK MAN AND CALLED 911.
BY THE TIME POLICE ARRIVED,
MARTIN WAS DEAD.
ZIMMERMAN SAID HE FAIRED IN SELF-DEFENSE.
>> Stephen: IT'S A HEARTBREAKING LOSS OF LIFE THAT STUNNED THE NATION AND
WHICH PRESIDENT OBAMA ADDRESSED ON FRIDAY.
>> WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS BOY, I THINK ABOUT MY OWN KIDS.
MAY MAIN MESSAGE IS TO THE PARENTS OF TRAYVON MARTIN.
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD A SON HE WOULD LOOK LIKE TRAYVON.
>> NOW AT FIRST I NAIVELY THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WAS EXPRESSING A MOVING
SENTIMENT TO A TROUBLED COUNTRY.
BUT THEN I LEARNED BETTER.
>> WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DO IS TRY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER,
NOT USE THE HORRIBLE AND TRAGIC INDIVIDUAL CASE TO TRY TO DRIVE A WEDGE IN AMERICA.
>> IS THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTING THAT IF IT HAD BEEN A WHITE WHO HAD BEEN
SHOT IT WHAT BE OKAY, IT JUST WOULDN'T LOOK LAKE HIM.
THAT'S JUST NONSENSE.
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S NONSENSE.
AND NEWT KNOWS NONSENSE.
MAY I REMIND YOU, HE IS STILL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER) LUCKILY-- LUCKILY THERE IS A WAY TO HEAL THE NATION'S RACIAL DIVIDE AND IT BRINGS
US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DRESSED TO KILL.
NOW PEOPLE ARE UP SET BECAUSE THE SHOOTER WAS NOT ARRESTED.
THANKS TO FLORIDA'S STAND YOUR GROUND LAW WHICH GIVES LEGAL IMMUNITY TO PEOPLE WHO
USE DEADLY FORCE AS LONG AS THEY BELIEVE THEIR SAFETY WAS IN DANGER.
NOW ONE WRINKLE WITH THAT LAW IS THAT WITHOUT WITNESSES, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE SHOOTER'S WORD FOR IT.
NOW IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO BLAME THE SHOOTER OR BLAME THE LAW THAT LET HIM OFF, OR
BLAME EASY ACCESS TO GUNS,
OR BLAME OUR NATION'S BORDERLINE PATHOLOGICAL DISTRUST OF YOUNG BLACK MEN.
LUCKILY, A TOP LEGAL MIND HAS FINGERED THE REAL CULPRIT.
>> I AM URGING THE FAMILY OF BLACK AND LATINO YOUNGSTERS PARTICULARLY TO NOT LET
THEIR CHILDREN GO OUT WEARING HOODIES.
PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU, AND WHAT DO THEY THINK.
WHAT IS THE INSTANT IDENTIFICATION, WHAT IS THE INSTANT ASSOCIATION.
IT IS THOSE CRIME SCENE SURVEILLANCE TAPES.
EVERY TIME YOU SEE SOMEONE STICKING UP A 7-11 THE KID IS WEARING A HOODIE.
I THINK THE HOODIE IS AS MUCH RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAYVON MARTIN'S DEATH AS GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WAS.
>> Stephen: YES, DID WAS THE HOODIE'S FAULT.
A HOODED SWEATSHIRT CAN MAKE AN INNOCENT TEEN LOOK LIKE A CRIMINAL.
JUST LIKE A SUIT AND GLASSES CAN MAKE GERALDO RIVERA LOOK LIKE A JOURNALIST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE, THIS IS URGENT.
CONGRESS MUST PASS STRICT HOOD-YEAR CONTROL LEGISLATION.
IT IS TER FEWING TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOU COULD WALK INTO ANY WAL-MART AND
BUY A HOODIE RIGHT OFF THE RACK.
NO BACKGROUND CHECK.
NO SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD.
NOW MANY PARENTS, MANY PARENTS KEEP THEIR HOODIES IN AN UNLOCKED DRAWER WHERE
THEIR KIDS CAN GET AT THEM.
THAT IS WHY MY HOODIES ARE HID THEN THE BACK OF MY GUN CLOSET.
PLENTY OF ROOM IN THERE.
BECAUSE I KEEP MY GUNS IN MY POCKET IN CASE ANYONE COMES FOR MY HOODIES.
AND FOLKS, FOX NEWS, THE GOOD PEOPLE OVER AT FOX NEWS AREN'T JUST TALKING THE TALK,
THEY'RE ALSO HIDING THE TALK BY HASTILY YANKING THE FOX NEWS HOODIE FROM ITS ON-LINE STORE.
WELL, THANK GOODNESS THEY DID THAT BECAUSE THEIR VIEWER KOS HAVE BOUGHT THOSE
HOODIES AND THEN FORMED A MOTORCYCLE GANG.
BUT FOLKS, RESTRICTIVE HOODIE LAWS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.
I HAVE CLOSELY STUDIED BLACK PEOPLE.
EVERYTHING FROM THEIR FAMILY REUNIONS TO THEIR CHRISTMASES TO THEIR MAD BLACK DIARIES.
AND I HAVE LEARNED THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS WEAR OTHER THINGS BESIDES HOODIES.
NOW SAYING THIS, SAYING THIS MIGHT OFFEND SOME PEOPLE BUT I BELIEVE BLACK PEOPLE ARE
NATURALLY STYLISH.
THAT'S NOT RACIST, THAT'S A FACT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S WHY-- COULD LOOK SO GOOD IN A SWEATER VEST AND
WHY AT LEAST ONE BLACK PERSON CAN RELATE TO RICK SANTORUM.
AND FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST SWEATER VESTS AND HOODIES,
THERE'S ALSO SHIRTS AND PANTS AND SOME AFRICAN-AMERICANS EVEN WEAR
DR. JACKETS OR FIREMAN'S HATS OR JUDGE'S ROBES.
WHICH OUTFIT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID OF?
SO I SAY FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY, FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY,
I'M CALLING ON THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO COME TOGETHER AND CHOOSE A SINGLE THREATENING
WARDROBE SO WE CAN ALL AGREE WHO TO BE AFRAID OF.
THEN DON'T WEAR IT BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BY YOUR OUTFIT.
I MEANS WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE GET THE POWERFUL HOODIE LOBBY OUT OF POLITICS.
SO AMERICANS OF ALL RACES CAN HAVE A FRANK AND OPEN DISCUSSION OF CLOTHING
CONTROL BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
BECAUSE IF WE EVER STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE HOODIES,
WE MIGHT STAR
