I WANT YOU TO KNOWI'M DEDICATING TONIGHT'S SHOW TO
THE WHALES.
[LAUGHING]>> Stephen: BEFORE WE GET
STARTED I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENTTO TALK TO THE YOUNGER VIEWERS
IN THE COLBERT NATION.
I KNOW YOU'RE FILLING OUTCOLLEGE APPLICATIONS OR
RECEIVING EARLY DECISIONLETTERS.
I KNOW YOU'RE EAGER TO MOVE OUTOF YOUR PARENT' HOUSE GO TO
COLLEGE AND THEN MOVE BACK TOYOUR PARENTS' HOUSE.
I KNOW IT'S STRESSFUL.
WHEN I APPLIED TO DARTMOUTHEARLY DECISION I WAS IN SECOND
GRADE.
I WROTE MY PAPER ON THE PERILSOF THE NANNY STATE.
I WENT AFTER MY NANNY HARD.
IT'S NOT NAPPY TIME, ROSITA, IWILL SLEEP WHEN I AM DEAD.
MY HIGH SCHOOL VIEWERS OUTTHERE, OVER ACHIEVERS APPLYING
TO HARVARD AND PRINCETON.
I AM CONCERNED YOU'RE AIMING TOOLOW.
IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A MOREELITE INSTITUTION ON THE SCENE.
>> WALMART, 600 JOB OPENINGS AND2300 JOB APPLICANTS.
>> AT A RATE THAT'S LESS THAN 3%ARE GETTING HIRED.
HARVARD HAS A HIGHER ACCEPTANCERATE.
>> Stephen: YES, WALMART IS NOWHARD TORE GET INTO THAN HARVARD.
BROWN STUDENTS WANT YOU TO KNOWTHEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO EITHER
OF THEM ANYWAY.
I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND WHYWALMART IS SUCH A SELECTIVE
INSTITUTION.
MANY OF OUR PRESIDENTS HAVE GONETHEIR TO BUY BULK TOILET PAPER.
YOUTH NATION, IT MAYBE TOO LATETO GET INTO THE WALMART OF YOUR
CHOICE.
WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS OF YOUR OWNGROOM THAT CHILD FOR WALMART
FROM DAY ONE.
THAT OF COURSE MEANS SENDINGTHEM TO THE RIGHT PRESCHOOL.
LOOK FOR ONE WITH A EMPHASIS ONBLOCK STACKING.
OKAY.
IT'S A SKILL THEY NEED FORMAKING TOWERS OF DISCOUNT MILK.
GOOD LUCK, NATION.
REMEMBER, ODDS ARE YOU WON'T GETIN.
BE SURE TO APPLY TO A SAFETY
