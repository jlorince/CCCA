WEINER TOMORROW.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THE NFL MAY BE IN
LOCKOUT MODE BUT MY
REPORTING IS STILL FULL
CONTACT AND LIKELY TO RESULT
IN HEAD TRAUMA.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WE BEGIN TONIGHT
ON A SAD NOTE AS AMERICA'S
SWEETHEART TEAM THE MIAMI
HEAT FELL TO THE DALLAS
MAVERICKS IN GAME SIX OF THE
NBA FINALS-- FINALS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DON'T COVER YOUR GRIEF.
(LAUGHTER)
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
AMERICANS LOVE ROOTING FOR
AN OVERDOG.
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT,
AMERICA IS THE LEBRON JAMES
OF THE WORLD.
THIS SPRING WE DECIDED TO
TAKE OUR TALENTS TO LIBYA
AND SO ENDS WHAT COULD HAVE
BEEN AN INSPIRING RICHES TO
EVEN RICHER STORY.
WHO COULD FORGET THE
SEASON'S HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
WITH LEBRON LEAVING
CLEVELAND FOR MIAMI IN AN
HOUR-LONG TELEVISED SPECIAL,
THEN JOINING HIS NEW
TEAMMATES DWAYNE WADE AND
CHRIS BORN TO RIDE ON A
STAGE I HAVEA FORKLIFT.
EVERYONE KNEW THEY WERE
DESTINED TO WIN.
AND PERSONALLY I'M OFFENDED
THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO
PROVE IT BY PLAYING
BASKETBALL.
BUT OF COURSE LEBRON HANDLED
IT WITH CLASS.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WAS
ROOTING ON ME TO FAIL, YOU
KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY
THEY HAVE TO WAKE UP
TOMORROW AND HAVE THE SAME
LIFE THAT THEY HAD BEFORE
THEY WOKE UP TODAY.
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THE SAME
PERSONAL PROBLEMS THAT THEY
HAD TODAY.
>> Stephen: LIKE THEY SAY,
IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU WIN OR
LOSE BUT HOW YOU DISPARRAGE
THE PATHETIC LIVES OF THE
LITTLE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT
POSSIBLE FOR TO YOU HAVE A
CAREER BOUNCING AN
INFLATABLE BALL.
NEXT.
WE TURN TO SOCCER.
HOW LONG WAS I OUT?
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS IT'S NO SECRET THAT I
DON'T LIKE SOCCER.
IT'S LIKE WATCHING GRASS
GROW BUT WITH A BUNCH OF
SOCCER PLAYERS IN THE WAY.
BUT I DO LIKE THE SPORTS
GOVERNING BODY FIFA BECAUSE
MI A HUGE FAN OF CORRUPTION.
I EVEN RUN A SOCCER
CORRUPTION FANTASY LEAGUE
WHERE YOU DRAFT A TEAM OF
YOUR FAVORITE BRIBERY
TECHNIQUES.
I AM DOMINATINGING THIS
YEAR.
MY STARTING LINE-UP INCLUDES
BOTH BAG OF CASH AND THAI
PROSTITUTES.
NOW JIMMY, JIMMY, I SAID
THAI, NOT BURMESE.
THANK YOU.
WELL, NOW THERE'S EXCITING
NEWS IN THE WORLD OF SOCCER
CORRUPTION.
>> DID QATAR BUY THE WORLD
CUP FOR 2022?
THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL
BECAUSE THERE ARE
ALLEGATIONS THAT A LOT, A
LOT OF MONEY CHANGED HANDS.
AND QATAR IS SAYING THAT
DIDN'T HAPPEN AND THE REASON
ARE THE U.S. SHOULD CARE IS
BECAUSE THEY PUT A BID IN
FOR 2022 TO HOST THE SOCCER
WORLD CUP.
AND THEY DIDN'T GET IT.
IT WENT TO QATAR.
>> YES, BECAUSE QATAR
CHEATED, AMERICA DIDN'T GET
THE WORLD CUP.
SO LET ME BE THE FIRST TO
SAY THANK YOU, QATAR.
WELL, FOLKS, THIS HAS CAUSED
SUCH A SCANDAL THAT IT HAS
EVEN RAISED THE HACKELS OF
FIFA PRESIDENT SETH BLADDER
WHO I BELIEVE IS NAMED AFTER
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION
INFECTIONFECTION.
NOW SETH IS CREATE AND
ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMITTEE TO
RESTORE FIFA'S CREDIBILITY
AND LOOK WHO HE WANTS TO
BRING ON BOARD.
>> IN THE ATTEMPT TO CLEAN
UP THE MESS WITHIN FIFA
MEANS HE IS ADEPTING TO
RECRUIT HENRY KISSING HER,
FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF
STATE.
>> Stephen: YES, TONIGHT'S
GUEST HENRY KISSINGER IS THE
PERFECT MAN TO CLEAN UP
FIFA.
AFTER ALL HIS EXPERIENCE
WITH VIETNAM PREPARES HIM
PERFECTLY FOR A SOCCER GAME.
THEY BOTH GO ON FOREEVER AND
AMERICA NEVER WINS.
(APPLAUSE)
FINALLY, FOLKS, SUMMER MEANS
WATER SPORTS.
AND THERE'S ONE THAT
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT.
SAY IT WITH ME.
FREESTYLE CANOE DANCING.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT WITH
ME.
(LAUGHTER)
JIMMY, LET'S GIVE THESE
PEOPLE A TASTE.
♪
♪ THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
(APPLAUSE)
HE WIELDS THE PADDLE LIKE
PICASSO WIELDED A PADDLE.
NOW FOLKS I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU, THAT WAS MARK ONS
ONS-- ORNSTEIN MASTER OF THE
HIGH NEEDLE AXLE POSITION
AND GOLD MEDALIST IN THE
NATIONAL FREESTYLE CANOE
COMPETITION.
I'M SUCH A FAN I EVEN HAVE
HIS ROOKIE CARD.
IT IS SUPERRARE IN THAT IT
DOESN'T EXIST.
THERE'S NOTHING ON HERE.
OF COURSE THIS IS THE MOST
EXCITING TIME OF YEAR FOR
FREESTYLE CANOE DANCING.
WHAT WAS CRINGE EL FEVER THE
ANNUAL EUROPEAN FREESTYLE
AND CANADIAN SMILE STYLE
PADDLE EVENT IN GERMANY AND
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA SOLO
RENDEZVOUS, THIS IS WHEN
CHAMPIONS ARE BORN OR
POSSIBLY DROWN
DE-- DEPENDING ON WH
CONDITIONS THIS YEAR MY
MONEY IS ON THE PROMPTSING
JOUM JONATHAN HAMMOND.
MANY PREDICT WILL GO ALL THE
WAY.
I WAS CAPTIVATED BY HIS
PERFORMANCE TO PHANTOM OF
THE OPERA AT THE 2007
MIDWEST FREESTYLE
COMPETITION.
THAT IS WHAT IS KILLING THE
BROADWAY MUSICAL.
NOT ENOUGH SMALL CRAFT
BOATING.
THE POINT IS, NATION, WE'LL
BE FOLLOWING CANOE DANCING
ALL SUMMER LONG.
THIS IS OUR FOURTH THIS IS
WHAT WE CARE ABOUT NOW.
AND BELIEVE ME, THIS HIGH
OCTANE MAN VERSUS NATURE
VERSUS SHOW TUNES VERSUS
HUMANA TENSION SPAN ACTION.
WILL MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR
THE CANCELLED NFL SEASON.

DANCERS!
