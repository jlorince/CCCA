I THINK YOU KNOW I NEED YOURENERGY, FOLKS IT IS SO GOOD.
IT IS SO GOOD TO HAVE YOUWITH US.
AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE MEWITH YOU.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
BECAUSE FOLKS, I WAS ONBREAK THE LAST TWO WEEKS,
FINALLY GOT TO SOME LONGDELAYED PROJECTS IN MY
WOODWORKING SHOP.
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKESOME REALLY NICE BOOK ENDS
BUT I CAN NEVER QUITE GETTHEM TO MATCH.
SO INSTEAD, I WON TWOEMMIES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW WHAT-- [BLEEP] YEAH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW WHAT-- [BLEEP] YEAH.
POINT IS, THE POINT IS,FOLKS, THESE ARE
MEANINGLESS.
AND I WILL KILL YOU IF YOUTRY TO TAKE THEM.
THE POINT IS, I'M BACK.
WHICH IS GOOD.
BECAUSE WITHOUT ME AROUNDFOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS THE
WORLD WENT AND THREW A BIG OLDTRAGEDY PARTY IT WAS LIKE
DON'T TELL MOM THEBABY-SITTER'S DEAD EXCEPT
EVERYONE IS DEAD.
AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROMMOM IN A WHILE. I'M WORRIED
BUT VIOLENCE ESCALATED INTHE MIDDLE EAST.
THE EASTERN, MIDDLE EAST ANDMOST UNSTABLE OF ALL, THE
MIDDLE WEST.
JIM?
>> 18-YEAR-OLD MICHAEL BROWNWAS SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES BY A
POLICE OFFICER IN BROADDAYLIGHT.
>> WITNESSES SAY BROWN HADHIS HANDS UP AND WAS
SURRENDERING WHEN HE WASSHOT MULTIPLE TIMES.
>> BROWN'S DEATH HAS SPARKEDA WEEK OF PROTESTS, LOOTING,
A SHOOTING AND SOMETIMESVIOLENT RESPONSES FROM
POLICE.
>> SADLY FERGUSON MISSOURIIS NOW BEST KNOWN FOR RACIAL
CONFLICT, POLICE BRUTALITYAND VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS.
AND NOT AS THEY CLAIMPROUDLY ON THE OFFICIAL CITY
WEBSITE, FOR FOOD TRUCKMONDAYS.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE NOW THIS IS THE FOOD
TRUCK.
AND IT SERVES FRESH, HIGHVELOCITY RUBBER BURRITOS.
AND THE HOT PEPPER SAUCE ISNOT OPTIONAL.
FOLKS, THIS IS A GENUINETRAGEDY THAT MANY ARE SAYING
IS THE FOUL HARVEST OF OURRACIST PAST.
BUT I URGE EVERYONE TO WAITTO PASS JUDGEMENT ON OFFICER
DARREN WILSON.
SOME ARE RUSHING TO JUDGETHIS MAN AS A VIOLENT RACIST
COP WHO GUNNED DOWN ANUNARMED BLACK TEENAGER.
BUT OTHERS ARGUE THAT HE ISA HEROIC POLICE OFFICER
DOING HIS JOB BY GUNNINGDOWN AN UNARMED BLACK
TEENAGER.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS
WAS RACIST OR EVEN IF RACISMSTILL EXISTS.
I FOR ONE DON'T SEE RACE.
NOT EVEN MY OWN.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE ANDI BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I
KEEP ASKING WAITERS ABOUTGLUTEN.
WHAT WE DO KNOW, WHAT WE DOKNOW IS THE SHOOTING OF AN
UNARMED YOUNG BLACK MAN IS ASTORY WE'VE HEARD FAR TOO
MANY TIMES BEFORE.
AND THE ONLY WAY TO ENSUREWE NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN IS
FOR THE PRESS TO STOPREPORTING IT.
>> I THINK THE COVERAGE HASBEEN A TRAVESTY.
LOOK AT IT FIRST FROM THESTANDPOINT OF QUANTITY.
HOW DID THIS INCIDENTJUSTIFY HUNDREDS IF NOT
THOUSANDS OF NONSTOP HOURSOF COVERAGE WHEN THERE IS SO
MUCH GOING ON IN THE WORLD.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF BADTHINGS THAT I THINK HAVE
COME FROM JOURNALISTS BEINGTHERE AND FROM ALL THE 24/7
MEDIA SPECULATION.
AND I THINK ONE IS THAT IT'SPROBABLY MADE THINGS MORE
VOLATILE.
>> I WROTE A COLUMN FOR FOXTHIS WEEK SAYING JUST
THEORETICALLY FLOATING THEIDEA, WHAT IF ALL THE
JOURNALISTS IN THIS TOWNPACKED UP THE EQUIPMENT AND
LEFT.
WOULD THAT HAVE HAD ANIMPACT ON THE VIOLENCE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE RESPONDEDAND SAID YES.
>> YES, I RESPOND.
IT'S TRUE.
THE PRESENCE OF A CAMERACLEARLY MAKES PEOPLE BEHAVE
RECKLESSLY.
BECAUSE I DONE BELIEVE FOR AMINUTE THAT HOWIE KURTZ
WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE IDEATHAT JOURNALISTS ARE TO
BLAME FOR THE FERGUSONVIOLENCE IF A CAMERA WASN'T
POINTED AT HIM.
FOR HIS OWN SAFETY GET THISMAN OFF OF TELEVISION.
IS THERE NOTHING-- (APPLAUSE)
>> IS THERE NOTHING TO BEGAINED?
AND THERE IS NOTHING TO BEGAINED BY INFLAMING THE
VOLATILE SITUATION OTHERTHAN A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY.
>> THE FUND-RAISING EFFORTHAS RAISED MORE MONEY THAN
THE MICHAEL BROWN MEMORIALSUNDAY ON THE WEB SITE.
>> FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONSFOR WILSON'S LEGAL FEES HAVE
REACHED AROUND $400,000.
>> EVEN THE MISSOURI CHAPTEROF THE KU KLUX KLAN HAS A
FUND-RAISER PLANNED FORWILSON.
>> EVEN THE LLAN IS PITCHINGIN.
I BELIEVE THEY HELD A BIKINI CARWASH.
NOW FOLKS -- BIKINI CAR WASH.
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
NOW AS IT STANDS SUPPORTERSOF OFFICER WILSON HAVE CROWD
SOURCED MORE MONEY THANSUPPORTERS OF MICHAEL BROWN.
YET SOMEHOW NEITHER HAVERAISED MORE MONEY THAN THE
GLYPH MOBILE PERSONALTHEATRE.
THIS IS WHAT OUR COUNTRYNEEDS.
THAT GUY, HE CAN'T SEE RACEOR THE TRUCK THAT IS ABOUT
TO HIT HIM.
AND WHILE MORE MONEY ISGOING TO OFFICER WILSON,
BROWN SUPPORTERS ARE BEINGBACKED BY AN ORGANIZATION
WITH NO RESPECT FOR THE LAW.
THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSENDING THREE WHITE HOUSE
OFFICIALS TO ATTEND BROWN'SFUNERAL IN ST. LOUIS
MISSOURI.
>> THEY SENT THREE WHITEHOUSE OFFICIALS TO THE
FUNERAL OF MICHAEL BROWN.
WHEN MARGARET THATCHER DIEDLAST YEAR THEY SENT NOBODY.
IN WHAT UNIVERSE DOESMARGARET THATCHER, ONE OF
THE GREATEST LEADERS MERITNOBODY AND MICHAEL BROWN
MERITS 3 WHITE HOUSEOFFICIALS.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS ADELEGATION TO FERGUSON YET
HE SENT NOT ONE JUSTICEDEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TO
INVESTIGATE THE MURDER OFMARGARET THATCHER.
(APPLAUSE)AT THE VERY LEAST HE COULD
