>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS,
REVIEWERS OF THIS SHOW KNOW
THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES A
YEAR THE NETWORK SOMETIMES
ASKS ME TO DO AN INTEGRATED
SPONSORSHIP WHICH I LOVE.
THE MONEY'S GREEN AND I'M
IN.
THESE SPONSOR-TUNITIES HAVE
LEAD TO SOME OF OUR MOST
MEMORABLE SEGMENTS FROM THE
HAIL TO THE CHEESE STEVEN
COLBERT'S NACHO CHEESE
DORITOES 2008 PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN COVERAGE TO LAST
WEAK'S SYRIAN ATROCITY
UPDATE BROUGHT TO YOU BY
FRUIT ROLLUPS.
FRUIT ROLLUP, OVERTHROW YOUR
TASTE BUDS.
NOW A LITTLE BROUGHT TO YOU
BY CEDE SIT USUALLY IT.
BUT TONIGHT, WE HAVE A
PRODUCT SO IMPORTANT,
BECAUSE TONIGHT IT'S WHEAT
THINS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHEAT THINS, CRUNCH IS
CALLING.
AND THE CALL IS COMING FROM
INSIDE YOUR MOUTH.
GET OUT OF THERE.
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING.
YOU'RE THINKING STEPHEN, HOW
IMPORTANT COULD WHEAT THINS
BE.
YES.
I USED TO THINK THAT WAY TOO.
UNTIL I RECEIVED THIS ACTUAL
MEMO FROM WHEAT THINS.
DETAILING FOR MY SPONSORSHIP
PURPOSES WHAT THE ROLE OF
WHEAT THINS IS IN OUR LIVES.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHEAT
THINS.
WLOOEP [BLEEP] YOU.
[BLEEP] YOU AND THE CRACKER
YOU RODE IN ON.
OKAY.
NOW LISTEN UP.
NOW SHUT UP!
LISTEN UP.
IF YOU'VE GOT SOME WHEAT
THINS AT HOME AND I HOPE YOU
DO, GO GET THEM.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GO BUY
SOME.
I'LL WAIT.
ARE THEY GONE?
>> GOOD BECAUSE I'M NOT
WAITING FOR ANYONE.
WHO DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE
WHEAT THINS.
NOW THE TEAM AT NAB IS COHAS
BROKEN-- NAB ISCO HAS BROKEN
DOWN THE CORE MESSAGE INTO
TWO DISTINCT CATEGORY, WHAT
IS THE ROLE OF THE BRAND AND
WHAT'S NOT THE ROLE OF THE
BRAND.
BULLET POINT ONE.
WHEAT THINS ARE THE PERFECT
SNACKING SIDE KICK WHENEVER,
WHEREVER, AND FOR WHATEVER.
OKAY.
WHAT'S IT GO WITH.
CHEESE, YES.
HUMMUS, SURE.
A DISCARDED STRIP OF TRUCK
TIRE, IT REQUEST HANDLE IT.
-- IT CAN HANDLE IT.
NOW I WOULD LOVE TO POUR
THIS WHOLE BOX IN MY MOUTH
RIGHT NOW.
BUT THE MEMO CLEARLY STATES
THAT WE CAN'T SHOW
OVERCONSUMPTION THAT IS A
BRAND DON'T.
A SERVING SIZE FOR WHEAT
THINS IS 16 CRACKERS.
SO AS DELICIOUS AS THEY ARE,
I SHOULDN'T EAT MORE THAN 16
AND ALSO IF THEY ARE SHOWN
OUT OF THE BOX LIKE IN A
BOWL, THERE SHOULD ONLY BE A
MAX OF 16.
SO REMEMBER, EVERYONE, WHILE
WHEAT THINS IS, QUOTE, A
SNACK FOR ANYONE WHO IS
ACTIVELY SEEKING EXPERIENCES,
THOSE EXPERIENCES DO NOT
INCLUDE THE EXPERIENCE OF
EATING 17 CRACKERS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS THE WAY, THAT IS THE
WAY IT SHOULD BE.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
IT, AND THEY HAVE, 16 IS THE
PERFECT NUMBER OF WHEAT
THINS TO KEEP YOU ON THE
PATH TO AND PROUD OF DOING
WHAT YOU LOVE TO DO NO
MATTER WHAT THAT IS.
NO MATTER WHAT.
DRIVING KIDS TO PRACTICE.
WATCHING A MOVIE.
ARSON.
NO JUDGEMENT.
BECAUSE WHEAT THINS ARE NOT
A CREATOR OF ISOLATED,
UNSHAREABLE EXPERIENCES.
THEY ARE A CONNECTOR OF
LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE
ENCOURAGING SHARING.
PERFECT FOR A PARTY.
SO JUST GET OUT.
JUST GET OUT.
JUST GET OUT THE BIG BOWL,
OKAY.
AND JUST FILL IT TO THE BRIM
WITH 16 WHEAT THINS.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.
16 WHEAT THINS.
AND YOU, AND 16 OF YOUR
FRIENDS ARE SET FOR THE
NIGHT.
AND FOLKS DON'T LISTEN TO
THE HATERS.
WHEAT THINS ARE NOT AN
EXCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIONARY
BRAND.
JUST GET IN HERE.
NOW I WANT TO REITERATE, I
DO NOT SAY THIS TOO MANY
TIMES, THIS IS AN ACTUAL
MEMO FROM WHEAT THINS THAT I
RECEIVED.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
UNDERSTOOD THAT BEFORE I
INFORMED YOU THAT WHEAT
THINS ARE NOT A CRUSADER OR
REBEL LOOKING TO CHANGE
INDIVIDUAL PATHS OR THE
WORLD.
NO!
THAT'S THOSE OUTSIDE
AGITATORS OVER AT CHEESE
NIPS.
YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM.
THEY'RE LIABLE TO START A RI
OT OUT THERE SHOWING
EVERYBODY THEIR NIPS.
ANYWAY, ANYWAY, FOLKS, NOW
THAT I UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH
PHILOSOPHY IS PACKED IN TO
EVERY 100% WHOLE GRAIN
SQUARE, I GOT TO HAVE ME
SOME.
16, OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, YEAH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IN FEELS RIGHT.
WHAT I STILL WANT MORE?
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SHOULD I GO
FOR 17?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE TO
WHEAT THINS, AND ITS ENTIRE
NABISCO FAMILY OF SNACKABLE
PRODUCTS.
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS
BUILDING A PURPOSEFUL
EXPERIENCE RELEVANT TO THE
BRAND BUT I SEE NOW THAT I
WAS BEING A CRUSADER AND OR
A REBEL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S IT FOR WHEAT THINS.
JOIN ME NEXT TIME WHEN I
WILL READ A MEMO FROM
SOMEONE ELSE WHO GAVE ME
