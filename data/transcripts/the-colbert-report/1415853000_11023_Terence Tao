>> Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHTIS A U.C.L.A. PROFESSOR WIDELY
REGARDED AS THE WORLD'S GREATESTLIVING MATHEMATICIAN.
I'LL ASK HIM WHAT NUMBER I'MTHINKING OF.
PLEASE WELCOME TERENCE TAO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )MR. TAO, PROFESSOR TAO, THANKS
SO MUCH FOR BEING ON.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> IT'S A PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE APROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AT
U.C.L.A.
YOU HAVE WON A FIELDS MEDAL,WHICH IS REGARDED AS THE NOBEL
PRIZE OF MATHEMATICS.
>> SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: IT'S BEEN CALLEDTHAT.
YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE THEMMacARTHUR GENIUS FELLOWSHIPS
AND YOU WON THE 2015BREAKTHROUGH PRIZE IN
MATHEMATICS, THOUGH IT'S ONLY2014. DID I JUST CHECK YOUR
MATH?>> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE.
>> Stephen: IT'S ALL ABOUT THEFUTURE OKAY.
YOU'RE KNOWN BY SOME OF YOURCOLLEAGUES AS THE MOZART OF
MATH.
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU GOTINTO MATH?
>> SO MY PARENTS TOLD ME WHEN IWAS TWO THEY FOUND ME
TEACHING SOME OLDER KIDSHOW TO COUNT USING NUMBER BLOCKS
>> Stephen: REALLY. SO YOU'REBOSSY, TOO?
>> I GUESS SO.
I DON'T REMEMBER IT MYSELF.
APPARENTLY I TAUGHT MYSELF TOCOUNT FROM "SESAME STREET."
>> Stephen: WAS THE COUNT VONCOUNT THE ONE WHO TAUGHT YOU?
>> I GUESS IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
GOOD GUY.
>> Stephen: HE SHOULD GET SOMEOF THAT FIELDS MEDAL MONEY, I
THINK.
YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIFICSPECIALTY WHICH IS PRIME
NUMBERS.
I REMEMBER, OBVIOUSLY, IREMEMBER MATH CLASS THERE'S THE
NUMBER LINE AND ALL THAT.
POSITIVE IS THAT WAY, NEGATIVEIS THAT WAY.
TALK TO ME ABOUT PRIMES.
WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUTPRIMES?
>> PRIME NUMBERS ARE WHOLENUMBERS BIGGER THAN 1 BUT THEY
CAN'T BE FACTORED INTO SMALLERNUMBERS.
THEY'RE THE ATOMIC ELEMENTS OFNUMBER THEORY.
IN CHEMISTRY -->> Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ATOMIC ELEMENTS
>> IN CHEMISTRY ALL MATTER ISMADE UP OF ATOMS, AND IN MATH
ALL NUMBERS ARE MADE UP OF WHOLENUMBERS LIKE 15 IS 3 TIMES 5
EVERY NUMBER CAN BE -->> Stephen:  I WANT TO CHECK
THE MATH ON THAT ONE.
HOLD ON.
3... THAT CHECKS OUT.
ALL RIGHT, SO?
>> SO THEY'RE VERY FUNDAMENTALIN MATHEMATICS.
BUT DESPITE BEING SOFUNDAMENTAL, AND THEY'VE BEEN
STUDIED SINCE THE ANCIENT GREEKSMORE THAN 2,000 YEARS AGO
THERE'S A LOT WE STILL DON'TKNOW ABOUT THEM.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY PRIMENUMBERS ARE THERE?
>> THEY GO ON FOREVER.
>> Stephen: THERE HAS TO BE ANUMBER OF THEM.
THEY'RE NUMBERS, ERGO, THEREMUST BE A NUMBER OF THEM.
>> THERE'S AN INFINITY OF THEM.
IT'S ANY NUMBER YOU WISH.
>> Stephen:  BUT THERE ARE NOMORE THAN INFINITY?
>> THERE'S ONLY AN INFINITENUMBER OF THEM.
>> Stephen: ONLY AN INFINITE.
THEY ARE LIMITED BY INFINITY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY.
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED TWINPRIMES.
>> YES, TWIN PRIMES ARE PAIRS OF PRIMES DISTANCED TWO
APART, ALMOST AS CLOSE AS THEYCOULD BE 5 AND 7.
11 AND 13.
THESE ARE TWIN PRIMES.
>> Stephen:  WOULDN'T--WOULDN'T-- WOULDN'T A TWIN PRIME
BE 5 AND 5?
>> NO, THAT'S A PRIME TWICE.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S TWINS.
TWINS ARE THE SAME PERSON TWICE.
>> WELL -->> Stephen:  5 AND 7 TWO YEARS
IS A LONG TIME FOR THE SECONDBABY TO STAY IN THE BIRTH CANAL.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: BEFORE IT COMESDOWN, OKAY?
TWINS CANNOT BE TWO DIFFERENTAGES?
>> THE ANALOGY IS A LITTLE -->> Stephen:  CHECK MATE, CHECK
MATE.
>> FAIR ENOUGH YOU CAUGHT ME.
>> Stephen:  I GOT YA.
>> THESE ARE PAIRS OF PRIMESWHICH ARE TWO APART.
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THEREARE.
SO YOU ASKED HOW MANY PRIMESTHERE WERE.
THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE AREINFINITELY TWIN PRIMES OR NOT.
THIS IS ONE OF THE OLDESTQUESTIONS IN MATHEMATICS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?>> YEAH ARE THE TWIN PRIMES
A FINITE RESOURCE OR DO THEY GOON FOREVER?
WE DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S A COUSINPRIME?
IS THERE A COUSIN-->> OH! WOW, OKAY.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> COUSIN PRIMES ARE PAIRS OFPRIMES THAT ARE FOUR APART, LIKE
7 AND 11.
THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS CLOSE ASTWINS PUT THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE.
AND THEN THERE ARE SEXY PRIMES.
>> Stephen: SEXY PRIMES?
>> SEXY PRIMES.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE THEY?
>> THAT'S THE OFFICIAL TERM.
PAIRS OF PRIMES THAT ARE SIXAPART.
SO WE DON'T KNOW THERE ISINFINITELY MANY TWIN PRIMES.
INFINITELY MANY COUSIN PRIMES ORIF THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY
SEXY PRIMES. BUT JUST THIS YEARIT WAS PROVEN -- BASED ON A
HYPOTHESIS -- THAT ONE ONE OFTHOSE THREE CLASSES WAS
INFINITE.
>> Stephen: WAIT A MINUTE, YOUDON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS
INFINITE, BUT YOU KNOW ONE OFTHEM IS?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW COULD YOU KNOWONE OF THEM IS BUT NOT KNOW
WHICH ONE?
IS THIS LIKE "LET'S MAKE ADEAL?"
THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENTCURTAINS.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
>> THERE'S A FORMULA FOR HOWMANY TWIN PRIMES THERE ARE UP TO
A CERTAIN POINT, AND HOW MANYSEXY PRIMES OR HOW MANY COUSIN
PRIMES.
AND YOU CAN ADD THEM UP.
AND WE KNOW THE SUM IS INFINITE.ONE OF THE THREE IS INFINITE BUT
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. WE'LLPROBABLY FIGURE THEM OUT
>> Stephen: ARE COUSIN PRIMESEVER SEXY BUT YOU'RE AFRAID TO
SAY IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS--( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )IT SOUNDS CREEPY?
>> OH, DEAR.
MAYBE SOME OF THE PRIMES, BUT,YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S YOURFAVORITE NUMBER?
( LAUGHTER )YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE, RIGHT?
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER?
>> IN MATHEMATICS YOU DON'T SORTOF TREAT ANY NUMBER WITH
FAVORITISM.
>> Stephen: THE BEST NUMBER IS5 BECAUSE THE JACKSON 5.
BEN FOLDS 5.
5, IT'S FIVE.>> OK
>> Stephen:  WELL WHAT'S NEXT?
WHAT'S THE NEXT-- IF YOU WON THEPRIZE FOR THE FUTURE OF MATH,
WHAT'S THE NEXT THING THAT'SHAPPENING IN MATH?
>> I AM WORKING ON FLUIDEQUATIONS.
>> Stephen: ON WHAT EQUATIONS.
>> FLUID EQUATION.
>> Stephen:  FOOD?
>> FLUID.
EQUATIONS THAT COVER THINGS LIKEWATER.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IFWATER CAN SPONTANEOUSLY BLOW UP.
>> Stephen: TERENCE, THATWOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO GOOD LUCK WITHTHAT.
KEEP IN TOUCH, PLEASE.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: TERENCE TAO, THANKYOU SO MUCH.
U.C.L.A. MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR,TERENCE TAO.
PRIME NUMBERS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
