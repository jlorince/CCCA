>> Stephen: WELCOME BAN,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WROTE A BOOK
ABOUT PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
EISENHOWER CALLED "GOING HOME TO
GLORY."
FUNNY?
I THOUGHT HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS
MAMIE.
PLEASE WELCOME JULIE AND DAVID
EISENHOWER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
OH, THIS IS A REAL PLEASURE.
NOW, YOU TWO HAVE A VERY UNIQUE
PLACE IN AMERICAN HIS TRY.
DAVID, YOU ARE THE GRANDSON OF
SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER AND
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
DWIGHT EISENHOWER.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND JULIE, YOU ARE
THE DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT NIXON.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: NOW, I WOULD ASK
HOW YOU TWO HOOKED UP, BUT I'VE
SEEN THE EVIDENCE.
JIM, DO WE HAVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH
OF THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE, THESE
LOVE BIRDS.
YOU'RE THE TWO IN THE MIDDLE?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND WHEN IS THIS?
>> THIS IS JANUARY 20, 1957.
JANUARY 21st.
>> WE WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD.
>> THAT'S CHIEF JUSTICE EARL WAR
REMEMBER OVER THERE ON THE
RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME.
I'M A HUGE WARREN HEAD.
IS THERE A LOT OF PRESSURE BEING
THE MOST ADORABLE COUPLE IN
AMERICA?
DO PEOPLE LOOK TO YOU AS SOME
SORT OF... LIKE ICONS OF A TIME.
>> WELL, IF THEY EVEN KNOW WHO
WE ARE AT ALL.
>> Stephen: OH, THEY WILL
KNOW, THE COLBERT BUMP.
>> PICKING UP PRESCRIPTION, YOU
SPELL EISENHOWER WITH AN "E,"
NOT AN "I."
>> Stephen: WHEN THEY ASK YOU
TO SPELL EISENHOWER, DO YOU EVER
SAY, "HE DEFEATED HIT HER"?
>>
THE
BOOK IS CALLED "GOING HOME TO
GLORY: A MEMOIR OF THE LIFE OF
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER.
" WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE FOR YOUR
GRANDFATHER AFTER HE LEFT THE
PRESIDENCY?
FIRST OF ALL, DID HE CONSIDER
PRESIDENT EISENHOWER OR GENERAL
EISENHOWER?
>> HE TOOK THE TITLE GENERAL AND
IT PUZZLED PEOPLE.
IT PUZZLED PRESIDENT KENNEDY.
DWIGHT EISENHOWER MADE THE
REQUEST OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY.
I THINK WHAT IT MEANT WAS HE
REGARDED HIS BOND WITH THE
SOLDIERS OF WORLD WAR II TO BE
THE BASIC REASON HE WAS IN
PUBLIC SERVICE.
I THINK HE CONSECRATED HIS
PRESIDENCY BY THAT ACT, TAKING
THE TITLE GENERAL.
>> FOR THE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO MAY NOT HAVE A MILITARY
EDUCATION, HE WAS SUPREME ALLIED
COMMANDER, A GUY WHO PLANNED AND
EXECUTED D-DAY.
>> EXECUTED D-DAY.
MARSHALL AND MONTGOMERY AND WHO?
>> HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
PLANNERS TO DEVELOP THE IDEA FOR
D-DAY.
>> Stephen: BY THE WAY, YOU
SAW WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT JOHN
McCAIN EARLIER.
I ACTUALLY ASKED THE SOLDIERS IF
THEY WANTED TO INVADE NORMANDY,
RIGHT?
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S HOW THE
MILITARY WORKS.
>> EXACTLY THE WAY IT WORKS,
YES.
>> Stephen: HERE'S SOMETHING I
THINK IS MORE AMAZING ABOUT THIS
MAN.
HE WAS PRESIDENT DURING THE PEAK
OF AMERICAN POWER IN THE WORLD.
I MEAN, FOR PETE'S SAKE, WE WERE
SENDING FOOD TO ENGLAND IN THE
1950S.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE GROWING UP AT
THE CENTER OF THAT POWER?
WAS WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE WITH
THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE
1950s.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, AWESOME?
>> AWESOME, YEAH.
>> HE WAS VERY EXCITING, AND YOU
CAN IMAGINE HOW POPULAR I MADE
YOU IN SCHOOL TO BRING YOUR
CLASSMATES TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
OH, SURE.
>> TO HAVE SECRET SERVICE, VERY
GLAMOROUS.
>> Stephen: WAS IT HARD FOR
HIM TO RETURN THE DAILY LIFE?
>> EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE FOR
HIM IN YEARS.
HE HADN'T DRIVEN A CARD IN
YEARS.
HE HADN'T EVEN PLACED TELEPHONE
CALLS.
HE HAD TO BE SHOWN HOW TO DIAL A
TELEPHONE.
WHEN HE LEFT OFFICE, THIS WAS
SORT OF A REHABILITATION... HE
PUT HIMSELF IN A REHABILITATION
PROGRAM.
>> Stephen: 20 YEARS OF
EVERYBODY DOING THINGS FOR HIM?
COULD HE FEED HIMSELF?
>> YES.
>> YES.
>> EXACTLY.
THAT'S THE IDEA.
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY PAMPERED,
AND SO HE... STEP ONE WAS TO
TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR IMMEDIATE
SURROUNDINGS AND THEN...
>> IT'S AMAZING.
>> HE GOT A DRIVER'S LICENSE.
>> Stephen: HE COULDN'T DRIVE?
>> WITHIN ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF
LEAVING OFFICE, HE SHOWS UP AT
THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF
MOTOR VEHICLES FOR A DRIVER'S
TEST.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THE STATE
TROOPERS ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT
THE GENERAL'S QUALIFICATIONS.
THEY OF COURSE CALLED HIM AN
EXCELLENT DRIVER.
THEY GAVE HIM THE LICENSE AND
WE'RE THE ONES WHO HAD THE DRIVE
AROUND WITH HIM IN THE PASSENGER
SEAT FOR YEARS.
>> HAND ME THE KEY, GRANDPA.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU AREST.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY
ADVICE FOR SASHA AND MALIA
GROWING UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN
THE PUBLIC EYE?
ARE THERE HAUNTED BATHTUBS WHERE
TAFT'S GHOST STILL SHOWS UP OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
ARE THERE THINGS YOU WOULD SAY
TO THE CHILDREN IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE
THERE ARE GHOSTS IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
PEEP IN THE STAFF WOULD NOT COME
TO THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE
HOUSE DURING THE NIXON YEARS,
RIGHT?
AT NIGHT.
>> I THINK THE LINCOLN BEDROOM
IS SUPPOSED TO BE HAUNTED.
I NEVER NOTICED IT.
THE OBAMAS SEEM LIKE A CLOSE
FAMILY.
I'M SURE THE GIRLS ARE HAVING A
LOT OF SLEEPOVERS.
THERE'S A SECRET STARE CASE.
THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES TO HIDE
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> WHERE DID YOU HIDE, AND WHO
DID YOU HIDE FROM?
>> I DID FIND A GREAT PLACE.
THERE'S THE QUEEN'S BEDROOM.
THERE'S A GREAT BIG WALK IN
SHOWER.
WE PLAYED A GAME OF SARDINES.
WE HAD A BIG GROUP OF
HOUSEGUESTS.
>> Stephen: SARDINES IN
COLLEGE?
THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT GAME
IN COLLEGE.
>> THE VERY BACK OF THE CLOSET
IS VERY DARK.
NOBODY COULD FIND ME.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
>> NO KIDDING.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GLAD YOU
EVENTUALLY FOUND HER?
DAVID EISENHOWER, JULIE NIXON
EISENHOWER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
