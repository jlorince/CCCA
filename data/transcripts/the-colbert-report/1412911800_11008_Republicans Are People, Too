( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )OKAY, JIM, LET'S GO OVER HERE.
NATION, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIMEYOU TURN ON THE NEWS LATELY, YOU
HEAR SOMETHING THAT SHOCKS YOUTO YOUR CORE.
JUST THIS MORNING, I WASHORRIFIED TO FIND OUT THERE IS
AN ELECTION NEXT MONTH!
AND THIS MIDTERM SEASON, THEBEST POLITICAL AD DOES NOT
PROMOTE A CANDIDATE.
IT PROMOTES A DEMONIZEDMINORITY.
♪  ♪>> Stephen: YES, REPUBLICANS
♪  ♪>> Stephen: YES, REPUBLICANS
ARE PEOPLE, TOO.
I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH COURAGEOUSREBRANDING SINCE WHITE CASTLE'S
"IT IS FOOD."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
AD, VINNY MINCHILLO, HAS VASTEXPERIENCE MAKING REPUBLICANS
SEEM HUMANS BECAUSE HE ONCEWORKED FOR MITT ROMNEY.
VINNY SAYS HE MADE THE ADBECAUSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, "I'VE
BEEN CALLED EVERY NAME IN THEBOOK.
IT'S BECOME SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLETO TALK ABOUT REPUBLICANS IN THE
MOST EVIL TERMS POSSIBLE."
OR TO PUT VINNY'S EXPLANATIONANOTHER WAY--
>> YOU POKED MY HEART.
>> Stephen: YOU POKED HISHEART.
AND JUST LIKE THAT LITTLE BOY,REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME
COMMUNICATING WITH WOMEN.
I TONIGHT KNOW WHY.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHY.
REPUBLICANS CAN BE ANYBODY.
THEY CAN BE WOMEN.
MEN.
BUT MOSTLY STOCK PHOTO MODELS.
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT WECHECKED WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHERS
AND FOUND OUT THAT THE GUY INFRONT OF THE PRIUS IS NOT A
REPUBLICAN, AND LIVES IN SWEDEN.
( LAUGHTER )AND THAT THE REPUBLICAN READING
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" DOES NOTAFFILIATE WITH EITHER PARTY AND
IS ACTUALLY READING THE "WALLSTREET JOURNAL."
I JUST THINK THAT THIS AD, THISJUST ADDS TO THE MESSAGE OF
INCLUSIVENESS.
REPUBLICANS CAN BE PEOPLE THATTHEY'RE NOT.
AS LONG AS WE CAN FIND THE RIGHTSTOCK PHOTO, I BELIEVE
REPUBLICANS CAN BE PEOPLE WHO DOYOGA ON PRODUCE.
REPUBLICANS CAN BE WOMEN WHO EATSALAD IN THE BATH TUB.
REPUBLICANS CAN BE ASTRONAUTSWHO TAKE THEIR HELMETS OFF IN
SPACE.
REPUBLICANS--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
REPUBLICANS CAN GET TANGLED INYARN.
AND REPUBLICANS CAN EVEN BE TVHOSTS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM, I, STEPHEN COLBERT HAVE ACONFESSION TO MAKE.
FOR NINE YEARS NOW I'VE BEENTELLING YOU I'M AN INDEPENDENT
CONSERVATIVE, BUT THAT WAS ALIE.
>> OOOHHH!
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY, ITHOUGHT I WAS FOOLING EVERYONE.
LAST NIGHT WHEN I FINALLY CAMEOUT MY FAMILY AS OPENLY
REPUBLICAN, THEY SAID THEYALWAYS KNEW.
THEY COULD TELL.
THIS COMMERCIAL HAS INSPIRED METO ENCOURAGE ALL CLOSETED
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE AFRAID TO BETHEMSELVES TO JOIN ME.
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, PAPA BEAR.
>> AWNS, I'M AN INDEPENDENT.
I'M AN INDEPENDENT, BUT I KNOWBOTH PARTIES PRETTY WELL.
>> I'M AN INDEPENDENT, I'M ANINDEPENDENT, ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, GIRLFRIEND,WHATEVER HELPS YOU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WHARF HELPS YOU CRY YOURSELF TO
SLEET AT NIGHT.
WE CAN TALK WHEN YOU'RE READY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
