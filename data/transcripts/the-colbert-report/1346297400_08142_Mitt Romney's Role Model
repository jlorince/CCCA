(LAUGHTER) AND, OF COURSE, FOLKS, WE DON'T NEED THIS CONVENTION TO TELL US
WHAT A MITT ROMNEY PRESIDENCY WILL BE LIKE.
WE CAN LEARN THAT STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE-OWNER'S MOUTHPIECE.
(LAUGHTER) ROMNEY CAMPAIGN MANAGER MAT ROADS, SEEN HERE CONTEMPLATING MURDER.
(LAUGHTER) ROADS TOLD THE HUFFINGTON POST THAT MITT WOULD MODEL HIS LEADERSHIP ON SUPERSTAR
PRESIDENT JAMES K. POLK.
(LAUGHTER) GOOD-BYE, BORING MITT ROMNEY!
HELLO POLK-MANIA!
JAMES K. POLK!
COME ON!
ONE OF AMERICA'S 44 BEST-KNOWN PRESIDENTS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE'S POLK FEVER HERE TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM BEST AS THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE MULLET.
(LAUGHTER) AND MITT'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER ISN'T THE ONLY ONE POINTING OUT
MITT'S POLK-RITUDE.
>> HE WILL BE LIKE POLK.
HERE'S A GUY WHO RAN AND SAID HE WOULD DO FOUR THINGS: HE WAS GOING TO REFORM THE TREASURY, HE
WAS GOING TO LOWER THE TARIFFS,
HE WAS GOING TO RESOLVE THE OREGON BORDER DISPUTE AND HE WAS GOING TO ADMIT TEXAS.
AND HE DID THESE FOUR THINGS,
SERVED ONE TERM AND GOT OUT.
>> Stephen: IT'S A PERFECT COMPARISON!
BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY HAS ALSO SAID HE'D DO FOUR THINGS AS PRESIDENT: "YOU'LL FIND OUT
LATER." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, LIKE POLK...
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, LIKE POLK ROMNEY WILL CONTINUE THE PRIORITIES OF THE
POLK ADMINISTRATION.
LIKE SLASHING THE BLOATED TARIFF OF 1842!
OR, AS IT WAS CALLED, "VAN BUREN CARE." I'M SORRY, FOLKS, I DON'T WANT
SOME GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRAT COMING BETWEEN ME AND MY WHALE TALLOW AND HOOP IRON!
PLUS, POLK INVADED MEXICO TO ANNEX TEXAS, MAKING HIM ALMOST AS UNPOPULAR WITH HISPANICS AS ROMNEY!
(LAUGHTER) SO, FOLKS, I AM PUMPED ABOUT A MITT K. POLKNEY PRESIDENCY.
EXCEPT THE COMPARISON MAY NOT DO MITT JUSTICE BECAUSE POLK WAS PRESIDENT IN THE 1840s.
AND ROMNEY AND RYAN'S POSITIONS ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN THAT.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)+++ATH0
