(APPLAUSE)FOLKS, AS A PATRIOT I HAVE
ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT DURINGA TIME OF WAR WE MUST ALL
PUT ASIDE OUR POLITICALDIFFERENCES, COME TOGETHER
AND RALLY AROUND OURCOMMANDER IN CHIEF.
BUT SOMETIMES A PRESIDENTACTS SO RECKLESSLY THAT MEN
OF GOOD CONSCIENCE CANNOT BUTSTAND AND SAY "NO MORE!"
JIM?
>> OUTRAGE THIS MORNING OVERPRESIDENT'S SALUTE WITH A
COFFEE CUP IN HIS HAND, SOMESAYING IT IS A LATTE SALUTE.
WHEN HE ARRIVED YESTERDAY ONAIR FORCE ONE IN LOWER
MANHATTAN WATCH THEINSTAGRAM IMAGES FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE.
YUP, THAT'S THE PRESIDENT.
SALUTING WITH WHAT LOOKSLIKE A STYROFOAM CUP EITHER
WITH COFFEE OR TEA ORWHATEVER IT IS, NONETHELESS,
HE DIDN'T SWITCH HANDS.
AND PEOPLE ARE FIRED UPABOUT THIS.
>> Stephen: OH, I AM MORETHAN FIRED UP ABOUT THIS.
(APPLAUSE)WARNING, WARNING, CONTENTS
ARE HOT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: AND BEFORE THE
UGLY ACCUSATIONS STARTFLYING FROM THE LIBERALS
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITHTHE FACT THAT THE COFFEE WAS
BLACK.
I AM SICK-- I AM SICK ANDTIRED--
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: I AM SICK AND
TIRED OF THE RACE HUSTLERSOUT THERE PLAYING THE
STARBUCKS GIFT CARD.
BECAUSE OBAMA WASN'T EVENDRINKING COFFEE.

THERE WITH MY CHAI TEA ANDGIVE THEM THE OLD, YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT A LATTE SALUTE, IT IS ACHAI SALUTE BECAUSE HE
DRINKS CHAI TEA.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, CARL,THANK YOU FOR THAT.
CHAI TEA.
(APPLAUSE)I BET THAT TEA HAD A SPRIG
OF ARUGALA IN THERE AND WASCERTIFIED HALAL BY AN
UNDOCUMENTED GAY MUSLIMBARISTA.
AND TO ANYONE WHO SAY OBAMA'S COFFEE SALUTE WAS AN
AWKWARD ACCIDENT RATHER THANTHE MANIFESTATION OF A
TWISTED MIND HELL-BENT ONDISRESPECTING OUR ARMED
FORCES, PREPARE TO BEEDUCATED.
>> LOOK, OBVIOUSLY I DON'TTHINK HE SAID LET ME PUT THE
COFFEE IN THIS HAND ANDSALUTE A MARINE.
I THINK HE WAS BUTTONING HISJACKET WITH ONE HAND, HE HAD
A COFFEE AND HE JUST,OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS TO HAVE
IT BACK.
I DON'T THINK HEINTENTIONALLY DID THAT, DO
