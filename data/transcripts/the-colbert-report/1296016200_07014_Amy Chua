EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A YALE
PROFESSOR WHO HAS WRITTEN A
CONTROVERSIAL BOOK ABOUT THE
DEMANDS CHINESE MOTHERS PUT ON
THEIR CHILDREN.
NOT HARVARD?
HER MOTHER MUST BE SO
DISAPPOINTED.
PLEASE WELCOME AMY CHUA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR COMING.
NOW, MADAM, LET'S GET RIGHT INTO
THIS HERE.
YOUR NEW BOOK, "THE BATTLE HYMN
OF THE TIGER MOTHER," HAS BOTH
EASTBOUND -- ENRAGED AND
SECRETLY THREATENED MOTHERS
ACROSS AMERICA.
THEY THINK YOU'RE WRONG BUT
PRIVATELY THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
RIGHT.
AND THEY DOUBT HOW THEY'RE
RAISING THEIR OWN CHILDREN.
DID YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL?
>> NO.
STEPHEN, THE FIRST...
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW THIS
REACTION HAS HAPPENED.
>> YES, I DO.
IT'S A LITTLE SURPRISING.
THE BOOK IS A MEMOIR.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.
IT'S A SELF-PARODY.
IT'S ABOUT HOW I TRIED RAISE MY
TWO DAUGHTERS THE SAME WAY MY
STRICT CHINESE IMMIGRANT PARENTS
RAISED ME.
IT IS ABOUT SOME OF THE
STRENGTHS THAT I THINK THAT
SYSTEM HAS, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT
MY MISTAKES AND MAKING FUN OF
MYSELF AND HOW I ULTIMATELY HAD
TO PULL BACK FROM THAT KIND
OF...
>> Stephen: NO, NO, DON'T PULL
BACK.
DON'T PULL BACK.
I THINK THE STRENGTHS OF THIS,
THE FIRMNESS THAT YOU HAVE WITH
THOSE KIDS, I MEAN, YOU'RE A
CHINESE-AMERICAN, YOU'RE NOT
CHINESE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BUT THERE IS A
POLITICAL COMPONENT HERE.
WE ARE TERRIFIED OF THE CHINESE
EVER SINCE THE OLYMPIC OPENING
GAMES.
( LAUGHTER )
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW?
WE THINK THEY'VE GOT MORE
DISCIPLINE THAN WE DO.
WE HAVE TO START TRAINING OUR
KIDS LIKE THAT.
CAN YOUR KIDS PAINT WITH THEIR
FEET AND BE HUMAN DRUMS AND FLY
AROUND STADIUMS?
>> THEY'RE GOOD AT THAT.
>>
>> Stephen: PEOPLE HAVE
ACCUSED YOU OF SAYING THAT THE
CHINESE WAY OF RAISING A CHILD,
WHAT CHINESE MOTHERS DO IS
SUPERIOR TO WHAT WESTERN MOTHERS
DO, TRUE OR FALSE?
>> FALSE.
FALSE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU RAISED YOUR
CHILDREN IN AN INFERIOR WAY?
>> NO, I...
>> Stephen: CAN I GET YOU A
BICYCLE THAT BACK PEDALS ANY
FASTER HERE?
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE CHINESE
MOTHERS ARE SUPERIOR.
IN FACT, IT SAYS ON THE COVER,
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A STORY OF
HOW CHINESE PARENTS ARE BETTER
AT RAISING KIDS THAN WESTERN
ONES.
>> YOU MEMORIZED THAT.
>> BUT INSTEAD IT'S ABOUT HOW I
WAS HUMBLED BY A 13-YEAR-OLD.
>> Stephen: HOW WERE YOU
HUMBLED BY A 13-YEAR-OLD?
>> WELL, AT 13 MY YOWJER
DAUGHTER REALLY REBELLED.
IT WAS A CRISIS.
AND I RETREATED A LITTLE BIT.
I GAVE HER MORE CHOICE, BUT
DON'T WORRY, NOT ALL THE WAY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I
THINK ARE REALLY GOOD.
>> Stephen: WHAT CHOICE DID
YOU GIVE HER?
>> I LET HER DROP THE VIOLIN AND
PLAY TENNIS INSTEAD.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Stephen: DID YOU AT LEAST
MAKE HER PLAY TENNIS WITH HER
VIOLIN?
>> THE VALUES THAT... ANYONE CAN
BE A CHINESE MOTHER.
YOU COULD BE A CHINESE MOTHER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD
QUESTION.
I HAVE THE HIPS FOR IT.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION: ARE
THERE TIGER FATHERS OUT THERE?
IS YOUR HUSBAND A TIGER FATHER?
IS HE AS STRICT AS YOU ARE?
>> YEAH, HE, IS HE IS.
BUT I DID ALL THE WORK.
>> Stephen: SO HE DOESN'T GET
THE PLAY GOOD COP TO YOUR BAD
COP?
GOOD COP/TOTALITARIAN COP?
WHAT VALUES ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LET
YOUR KIDS HAVE SLEEPOVERS, RIGHT
IN
>> RIGHT.
THEY WERE BUSY PLAYING THE
VIOLIN AND THE PIANO.
>> Stephen: WHAT ELSE COULDN'T
THEY DO, PLAY DATES WITH THEIR
FRIENDS?
>> NOT SO MANY BETWEEN THE AGES
OF NINE AND 13.
>> Stephen: OH, NOT AN
IMPORTANT TIME FOR KIDS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> THEY HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> BUT I THINK THE VALUES OF
HARD WORK AND DON'T GIVE UP AND
DON'T BLAME OTHERS, I THINK
THEY'RE FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN
VALUE, THE ONES CHAMPIONED BY
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS.
>> Stephen: DID YOU DISCOURAGE
YOUR DAUGHTERS FROM FOLLOWING
THEIR OWN INTERESTS?
>> WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER, I
THINK I DID RESTRICTED THEIR
CHOICES MORE THAN A LOT OVER
PARENTS AROUND ME.
>> Stephen: WHAT WERE THEIR
CHOICES?
WERE THEIR CHOICES YOUR CHOICES
FOR THEM?
>> IN SOME WAYS.
>> Stephen: NOW HOW ACTED FOR
YOU?
DID YOUR MOTHER GIVE YOU
CHOICES?
>> MUCH FEWER.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO GET
THIS, THE PATH WORKS THAT YOUR
CHILDREN DON'T GET TO MAKE A
CHOICE, BUT THEY GET TO CHOOSE
FOR THEIR CHILDREN, SO YOU PASS
THE DESIRE DOWN A GENERATION.
>> BUT IT'S NOT FOREVER.
IT'S ONLY EARLY CHILD REARING.
I THINK YOU GIVE A FIVE-YEAR-OLD
OR AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD FREE
CHOICE, PURSUE YOUR PASSION
TODAY, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO
BE VIDEO GAMES FOR FIVE HOURS.
SO I WAS MORE INSTRUCTIVE IN
THOSE CHOICES.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY COULD
SCHOOL YOU IN HALO.
THEY MAY NOT GET INTO THE
COLLEGE OF THEIR CHOICE.
IF THERE WAS ONE MISCONCEPTION
ABOUT THIS BOOK, WHAT WOULD IT
BE?
>> THAT I'M TRYING TO TEACH
OTHER PEOPLE HOW THE PARENT.
IT'S NOT A PARENTING BOOK.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT A HOW-TO.
>> NO, IT'S NOT A HOW-TO.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO TAKE IT LIKE THAT.
>> WHY?
IT SAYS ON THE COVER THEY WAS
HUMBLED BY A 13-YEAR-OLD.
>> Stephen: THAT COMES OFF.
IT'S GONE.
YOU THINK MOTHERS COULD JUST BUY
THIS AND HOLD IT OVER THEIR
CHILDREN AND SAY, "DON'T MAKE ME
GO TIGER MOM ON YOU."
THEY COULD GET ALL THE BENEFITS
WITHOUT HAVING TO BE HARD ASS.
DO ALL IMMIGRANTS DO YOU THINK
PUSH THEIR CHILDREN A LITTLE
HARDER THAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
HERE FOR A WHILE?
>> I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT COMING FROM FAR-OFF LAND.
OFTEN YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
DEPRIVATION.
THIS IS A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY.
MY OWN FATHER, HE WORE THE SAME
PAIR OF SHOES FOR EIGHT YEARS.
THEY SAVED EVERYTHING FOR US.
SO, YOU KNOW, UNDER THOSE
CONDITIONS, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S
WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY, YOU
KNOW, AN A MINUS, THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.
WE GAVE YOU THESE OPPORTUNITIES.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THEM.
THAT MADE SENSE TO ME.
IT WAS DIFFERENT WHEN I TRIED TO
DO IT WITH MY OWN KIDS.
IT DIDN'T WORK AS WELL.
>> Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOUR
DAUGHTERS NOW?
>> 15 AND 18.
>> Stephen: 15 AND 18.
>> AND THEY HAVE REBELLED ON
YOU?
>> PARTIALLY THEY'RE HERE IN THE
AUDIENCE.
>> Stephen: THEY ARE?
ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE OKAY?
GOOD.
THEY SEEM LOVELY.
THEY DON'T SEEM TOO DAMAGED.
>> THEY ARE SO STRONG.
>> Stephen: AMY CHUA, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: THE BOOK IS
