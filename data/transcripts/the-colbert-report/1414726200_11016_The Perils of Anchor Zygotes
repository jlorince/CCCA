>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
NATION ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU WATCHTHE NEWS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.
IF YOU KNOW THE NEWS, YOU KNOWTHAT BARACK OBAMA IS ONCE AGAIN
FAILING TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.
COUNTLESS LATINOIDS ARE MEXICANHAT DANCING RIGHT IN TO STEAL
OUR JOBS.
LUCKILY, WE HAVE OUTSMARTEDTHEM BY HIDING THOSE JOBS IN
CHINA.
( LAUGHTER )AND THE NEWEST IMMIGRATIONCRISIS
COMES FROM WOMEN AND WHATTHEY'RE DOING SOUTH OF THE LADY
BORDER.
>>  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONJUST
PASSED A NEW MEASURE ALLOWINGBABIES OF NON-AMERICANS BUT BORN
FROM AMERICAN SURROGATES TO GETU.S. PASSPORTS.
FOREIGN CHILDREN AND THEIRPARENTS WILL GET ACCESS TO
AMERICAN EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE,WELFARE, AND RETIREMENT
SERVICES.
SOMEBODY WHISPER THAT IN THEWOMB.
>> Stephen: YES, NON-AMERICANBABIES BORN TO AMERICANS WILL
NOW BE ABLE TO GET U.S.
CITIZENSHIP.
SOMEBODY WHISPER THAT IN THEWOMB.
BUT FIRST, PRESS THE BELLYBUTTONTWICE FOR ENGLISH.
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE THIS WEEK,THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY EXPANDED THE DEFINITIONOF MOTHER TO INCLUDE WOMEN WHO
GAVE BIRTH TO THE CHILD,REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE
THE GENETIC MOTHERS, ALL TOACCOMMODATE WOMEN USING
ASSISTIVE REPRODUCTIVETECHNOLOGY SUCH AS IN VITRO
FERTILIZATION.
PREVIOUSLY, IF AN AMERICAN WOMANPREGNANT WITH AN ANONYMOUS DONOR
EGG HAD HER BABY IN, SAY,LONDON, CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE A
U.S. CITIZEN, DOOMING IT TO ALIFETIME OF BRITISH CUISINE.
I FOR ONE DO NOT THINK BABIESSHOULD BE DRINKING WARM BEER.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OFTHIS REALLY MEANS, BUT I THINK
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS REALLYMEANS.
>> IF FEELS LIKE AN EXPANSION OFTHE DEFINITION OF MOTHERHOOD,
JUST LIKE WE EXPAND THEDEFINITION OF GENDER AND OTHER
THINGS.
>> WHEN YOU'RE A SURROGATE,YOU'RE NOT GENETICALLY
THE CHILD'S MOTHER.
>> GOT IT.
SO THERE'S NO AMERICAN GENETICSINVOLVED AT ALL.
>> EXACTLY.
>> THIS IS DISTURBING AS WHAT WEDO TO CREATE CITIZENS IN
THIS COUNTRY. YOU'RE NOT PASSINGON THE CIVIC DUTY, THE
UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICA.
IT JUST FEELS LIKE A TOTALEROSION
>> Stephen: IT'S A TOTALEROSION, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW
THAT CITIZENSHIP IS GENETIC, ANDAS A CHRISTIAN, I BELIEVE
AMERICAN BEGINS AT CONCEPTION.
I MEAN, UTERUS-A!
UTERUS-A!
UTERUS-A!
UTERUS-A!
OH, THAT WAS GOOD.
NATION, I GOTTA SAY I'M SCAREDTHIS LAW COULD INSPIRE A WHOLE
GENERATION OF AMERICAN WOMENTRYING TO CASH IN BY MOVING
ABROAD AND CARRYING ANCHORZYGOTES.
AND, YES, THAT MAY SOUND BAT( BLEEP ) CRAZY TO MOST PEOPLE,
BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT THESEPEOPLE.
>> ARE YOU GOING TO HAVEAMERICAN WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD
TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK OFF THIS?
SO WHAT IF THAT SURROGATE MOMWHO IS AN AMERICAN DECIDES WELL
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M KIND OF SELLING CITIZENSHIPHERE.
120 GRAND AIN'T GOING TO CUT IT.
LET ME GET THAT PUPPY UP TO AQUARTER MILLION.
IS THAT TAXABLE INCOME?
>> GOOD POINT.
IS THAT TAXABLE INCOME?
OR CAN THE BABY WRITE OFF YOURWOMB AS A HOME OFFICE?
BUT, FOLKS, THERE IS A BRIGHTSIDE TO THIS FALLOPIAN LOOPHOLE.
AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALREADYHELPED MILLIONS PROCREATE WITH
MY EXCLUSIVE LINE OF PREMIUMMAN-SEED, STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FORMULA 401.
BUT--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IF THERE'S THIS MUCH MONEY TO BEMADE IN U.S.D.A. CERTIFIED
AMERICAN EGGS, THEN DADDY WANTSIN.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM PROUD TOUNVEIL MY NEW PRODUCT, STEPHEN
COLBERT'S FORMULA  4 OVUM.PREMIUM MAN-EGG.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

AN AMERICAN BABY.
