>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
TO MY ONGOING COVERAGE OF BLACKHISTORY MONTH.
OF COURSE, A SAD AND REPULSIVECHAPTER OF BLACK HISTORY IS THE
KU KLUX KLAN.
LAST YEAR, I TOLD YOU HOWKLANSMEN WERE ARRESTED FOR
OFFERING TO SELL JEWISH GROUPSA WORKABLE DEATH RAY.
WELL, RECENTLY, THANKS TO MYLONGSTANDING GOOGLE NEWS ALERT
FOR "KLAN DEATH RAY," I LEARNEDTHERE WAS AN UPDATE.
>> AN UPSTATE MAN HAS JUST PLEDGUILTY TO HELPING BUILD A DEADLY
X-RAY MACHINE THAT USESRADIATION TO KILL PEOPLE.
>> AUTHORITIES SAY THEY WERETIPPED OFF TO THE PORTABLE X-RAY
DEVICE AFTER CRAWFORD APPROACHEDLOCAL JEWISH GROUPS BECAUSE HE
WANTED THEIR HELP IN KILLINGMUSLIMS.
>> Stephen: YES, JUSTICE WASDONE.
THEY'RE A VILE, DESPICABLE HATEGROUP, BUT I CAN'T HELP FEEL
A LITTLE INSPIRED BY THE WAYTHESE KLANSMEN OVERCAME THEIR
HATRED OF JEWS TO SERVE AGREATER CAUSE-- THEIR HATRED OF
MUSLIMS.
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THE KLANAS A BUNCH OF REDNECKS FROM OUR
SHAMEFUL RACIST PAST.
WELL, IT TURNS OUT I WAS WRONG.
BECAUSE THEY'RE A BUNCH OFREDNECKS FROM OUR SHAMEFUL
RACIST FUTURE.
I WAS SO MOVED BY THIS STORY OFHOPE THAT I DID THE OBVIOUS
THING-- I TURNED IT INTO ACARTOON.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
A CARTOON THAT ANSWERS THEQUESTION-- WHAT IF THE KLAN
COMPLETED THEIR DEATH RAY ANDUSED IT FOR GOOD?
AS FOR THE OTHER QUESTION YOU'REASKING YOURSELF RIGHT NOW-- NO,
I'M NOT ( BLEEP ) YOU.
NOW, MY NETWORK DIDN'T WANT METO AIR THIS CARTOON TONIGHT,
SENDING THIS INFLAMMATORY E-MAILTHAT READS, "WE'RE A LITTLE
CONCERNED WITH THIS, ESPECIALLYBECAUSE IT IS AIRING DURING
BLACK HISTORY MONTH."
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE MAN IS TRYING TO KEEP MEDOWN!
NOW, WERE THEY POLITE ABOUT IT?
YES.
WERE THEY MAKING A REASONABLEPOINT?
ABSOLUTELY.
DO I HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE IOVER-REACT TO BEING TOLD WHAT TO
DO?
YOU BET YOUR ASS I DO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )I BELIEVE I MUST AIR THIS DURING
BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
IF I DON'T, I'D BE TREATINGBLACK PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY, AND
THAT IS SOMETHING I ONLY DOSUBCONSCIOUSLY!
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NOW, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,NOKES, I MAY NOT LIKE WHAT THIS
CARTOON SAYS BUT I WILL FIGHT TOTHE DEATH FOR THE RIGHT TO AIR
IT BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVEANYTHING ELSE READY.
IS IT RIGHT TO RUN THIS CARTOONTONIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL LET HISTORY BE THE JUDGE.
BLACK HISTORY.
