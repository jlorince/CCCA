ELECTION DAY LOOMING EVERY ONE IS TRYING TO READ THE TEA LEAVES.
EXCEPT ROMNEY WHO AS A MORMON IS ALLOWED ONLY TO READ THE CAFFEINE FREE DIET COKE.
BUT THAT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD EITHER BECAUSE OBAMA CURRENTLY LEADS ROMNEY BY 10 POINTS IN OHIO, 9 POINTS IN
FLORIDA AND 12 POINTS IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM IF BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 6th WE CAN JUST
GET 290 MILLION PEOPLE TO MOVE TO ARKANSAS.
(LAUGHTER) ARKANSAS, COME FOR THE MESS, STAY BECAUSE YOU TRADED YOUR CAR FOR METH.
BUT--  (APPLAUSE) BUT, FOLKS THERE IS NO REASON TO PANIC OVER THESE POLE NUMBERS.
JUST ASK MITT.
>> I'M CURIOUS TO WHAT YOU WOULD SAY TO YOUR SUPPORTERS, YOUR DONORS THAT MIGHT BE CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD BE
SLIPPING AWAY WAY.
>> I'M VERY PLEASED WITH SOME POLLS, NOT WITH OTHER POLLS BUT AT THIS EARLY STAGE POLLS GO UP AND DOWN.
>> EXACTLY, IT'S STILL EARLY, THERE ARE 40 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE ELECTION AMOUNT OF LOT CAN HAPPEN IN 40 DAYS.
BAMA COULD MAKE A GAFFE.
MITT COULD WIN THE DEBATES.
GOD COULD SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY ALL MANKIND.
SO THERE'S HOPE.
(LAUGHTER) IN FACT, THE ELECTION IS SO FAR OFF, WHY ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT.
MITT ISN'T TALKING ABOUT IT.
LAST WEEK WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM IF HE WAS GOING TO START CAMPAIGNING HARDER ROMNEY RESPONDED, HA HA,
WE'RE IN THE STRETCH, AREN'T WE.
LOOK AT THOSE CLOUDS.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
LOOK AT THOSE THINGS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YEAH, YEAH.
(APPLAUSE) JUST LOOK AT THOSE THINGS.
LOOK AT THOSE PRETTY CLOUDS.
THAT ONE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A BUNNY.
OR IF YOU TURN YOUR HEAD THE OTHER WAY, CRUSHING POLL
