>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, IT IS PRIMARY NIGHT IN
ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, HAWAII AND
AMERICAN SAMOA.
NOW, I PRETAPED THE SHOW, SO NO
ONE TELL ME WHO WON OR WHERE
AMERICAN SAMOA IS.
[LAUGHTER]
WHOEVER WINS TONIGHT, THEY WILL
BE PLAIN SPOKEN FOLK.
BECAUSE WHILE OBAMA DRONES ON
AND ON WITH HIS SAT WORDS, THERE
IS NO TOPIC THAT THESE GENTLEMEN
CANNOT EXPLAIN USING PHRASES NO
MORE COMPLEX THAN "I LIKE TO EAT
Y'ALL'S CHEESY GRITS."
I MEAN, JUST LISTEN TO HOW RICK
SANTORUM BREAKS DOWN GLOBAL
WARMING.
>> THE DANGERS OF CARBON
DIOXIDE, TELL THAT TO A PLANT
HOW DANGEROUS CARBON DIOXIDE IS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
TELL THAT TO A PLANT.
LIKE MY HOUSE PLANT ROBERT HERE.
WHO FOR SOME REASON IS
SUPPORTING OBAMA.
HEY, HEY, HEY, BOBBY, DO YOU
WANT OBAMA TAKING AWAY CARBON
DIOXIDE THAT YOU NEED FOR PHOTO
SYNTHESIST?
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BEFORE
INDUSTRY AND CARS EARTH HAD NO
VEGETATION.
THAT'S WHY FACTORIES ARE CALLED
PLANTS.
OKAY.
READ A BOOK.
THEY'RE MADE OF YOU.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
STUPID.
STUPID PLANT.
OF COURSE, ROMNEY ALSO KNOWS HOW
TO MAKE COMPLEX SUBJECTS SIMPLE.
WATCH HIM PUNCH HOLES IN THE
PRESIDENT'S SO-CALLED ENERGY
POLICY.
>> LOOK AT HIS ENERGY POLICY.
WHAT IS HIS ENERGY POLICY.
YOU CAN'T DRIVE A CAR WITH A
WINDMILL ON IT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> YOU CAN'T DRIVE A CAR WITH A
WINDMILL ON IT.
BECAUSE IF YOU PUT A WINDMILL ON
TOP OF YOUR CAR, THEN WHERE DOES
THE DOG GO.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
BUT NOBODY BUT NOBODY IS BETTER
AT KEEPING IT KNOWLEDGE-FREE.
THAN GINGRICH DPRICH.
LISTEN TO NEWT DESCRIBE ONE OF
OBAMA'S CRAZY ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
SCHEMES.
>> IF YOU READ THE PRESIDENT'S
ENERGY SPEECH, HE'S IN CLOUDY
CUKOO LAND.
THE BIGGEST ISSUE THIS FALL WILL
BE DRILLING VERSUS ALGAE.
I THINK THIS SUMMER AS GAS
PRICES KEEP GOING UP, ONE OF OUR
CAMPAIGN TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE TO
HAVE PEOPLE GO TO GAS STATIONS
WITH A JAR OF ALGAE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND SAY TO PEOPLE, WOULD YOU
RATHER HAVE THE GOOD EVENING F
GINGRICH SOLUTION OF DRILLING
AND HAVING MORE OIL, OR WOULD
YOU LIKE TO TRY TO PUT THIS IN
YOUR GAS TANK.
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN'T MAKE
THIS STUFF UP, BUT NEWT CAN
BECAUSE EXXON HAS COMMITTED $600
MILLION TO DEVELOPING THIS
TECHNOLOGY IN CLOUD CUCKOO LAND.
BESIDES, ALGAE FUEL WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO POWER THE SPACESHIP
THAT WILL TAKE US TO NEWT'S
COMPLETELY FEASIBLE MOON COLONY.
I REALLY JUST WISH WE HAD
CANDIDATES LIKE THESE YEARS AGO
SO WE COULD HAVE EXPLAINED THE
STUPID TRUTH BEHIND STUFF LIKE
THE TELEPHONE.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, I'M
GOING TO TALK INTO A BOX AND MY
WIFE WILL HEAR ME?
BUT WHO WILL GET MY WIFE OUT OF
THE BOX?
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP.
AND HOLD ON THERE, SPORT, YOU
WANT TO CURE MY SYPHILIS WITH
MOLD YOU GREW ON A HUNK OF
BREAD?
NO THANKS.
I PREFER TO REMAIN BLIND AND
INSANE, AN I'M PRETTY SURE THESE
GENTLEMEN FEEL THE S
