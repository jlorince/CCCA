OH, BABY, COME ON!
YES, YES!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OH, WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, YOU FEEL THE ELECTRICITY
IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU FEEL IT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
THE MASSACHUSETTS
SENATE SEAT PREVIOUSLY HELD BY
LIBERAL LION TED KENNEDY WAS WON
BY A REPUBLICAN!
WOO.
[MODERATE APPLAUSE]
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS MORNING IN AMERICA, THE
BOSTON TEA PARTY, BATTLE OF
GETTYSBURG, ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT WING
NIGHT AT CHILI'S ALL ROLLED UP
INTO ONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THE UPSET WAS PULLED OFF BY
NEW POLITICAL SUPERSTAR SCOTT--
I'M SORRY, WAS IT BAIO?
BAIO?
NO, ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SCOTT TOWELS?
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
SCOTT BROWN!
SCOTT BROWN.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I DON'T
KNOW WHO HE IS.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT HE
KNOWS WHO HE IS.
JIM?
>> I'M SCOTT BROWN FROM -- I'M
SCOTT BROWN.
HANG ON, GIVE HIM A MULLIGAN.
JUST OUT OF GATE.
>> I'M SCOTT BROWN. I'M FROM
WRENTHAM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I DRIVE A TRUCK.
>> STEPHEN: HE DRIVES A TRUCK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOT A BEDLINER,
MUDFLAPS MAYBE A STICKER OF
CALVIN PEEING ON THE HEALTH CARE
BILL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOUNDS LIKE A SOLID GUY.
AND IT LOOKS LIKE I OWE
MASSACHUSETTS AN APOLOGY.
I'VE BEEN TOUGH ON THE BAY STATE
IN THE PAST.
YOU ALL KNOW, I THINK OF THE 50
STATES AS MY CHILDREN.
EXCEPT FOR MASSACHUSETTS. THAT
ONE'S ADOPTED AND GAY.
MASSACHUSETTS OR AS I CALL IT
GAYSRAEL.
OF COURSE, WE ALL KNOW
MASSACHUSETTS IS AN ANAGRAM FOR
THE ASS SAC SMUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SORRY, MASSACHUSETTS.
I NEGLECTED TO POINT OUT THAT
YOUR NAME IS ALSO AN ANAGRAM FOR
MASS: SUCH STATE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE BEST PART --
THE BEST PART IS THAT SENATE
REPUBLICANS NOW HAVE AN
UNSTOPPABLE 41 SEAT "SUPER
MINORITY"!
[ LAUGHTER ]
UP UNTIL NOW, THE ONLY SUPER
MINORITY REPUBLICANS HAVE SEEN
IS AGUAMAN!
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE CAN TALK TO CEVICHE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS EXCITED AS I AM ABOUT THE
ELECTION OF SCOTT-- I'M SORRY--
LAND?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
UM, BROWN!
IT DOES COME WITH ONE DOWNSIDE.
>> WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO START
OVER ON THIS HEALTH CARE DEBATE.
>> START OVER.
>> WE REALLY SHOULD START FROM
SCRATCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: NO.
NO,
