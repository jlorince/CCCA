>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
NATION, IT'S NO SECRET.
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THE SHOW, YOU
KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN AN EARLY
SUPPORTER OF G.O.P. FRONT-RUNNER
RICK PERRY, SO, FOLKS, I WAS
CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN HIS FELLOW
REPUBLICANS TURNED ON HIM IN
MONDAY'S DEBATE.
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME
SAY FOR RICK TO SAY THAT YOU
CAN'T SECURE THE BORDER I THINK
IS PRETTY MUCH A TREASONOUS
COMMENT.
>> I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND THE
GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE MIGHT RAISE
MY TAXES OR SOMETHING.
>> I THINK GOVERNOR PERRY WOULD
AGREE WITH ME THAT IF YOU'RE
DEALT FOUR ACE, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU NECESSARILY A GREAT
POKER PLAYER.
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
WHAT MAKES YOU A GREAT POKER
PLAYER IS YOUR ABILITY TO BLUFF,
LIKE A MORMON TRYING TO CONVINCE
PEOPLE THAT HE HAS EVER PLAYED
POKER.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, I WAS BLINDING SIDED,
BLIND SIDED WHEN SOMETHING WOLF
BLITZER SAID ACTUALLY INFORMED
ME.
JIM?
>> GOVERNOR PERRY, AS YOU WELL
KNOW, YOU SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE
ORDER REQUIRING LITTLE GIRLS, 11
AND 12-YEAR-OLD GIRLS TO GET A
VACCINE TO DEAL WITH A SEXUALLY
TRANSMITTED DISEASE THAT COULD
LEAD TO CERVICAL CANCER.
>> I'M A MOM, AND I'M A MOM OF
THREE CHILDREN.
AND TO HAVE INNOCENT LITTLE
12-YEAR-OLD GIRLS BE FORCED TO
HAVE A GOVERNMENT INJECTION
THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IS
JUST FLAT OUT WRONG.
I'M OFFENDED FOR ALL THE LITTLE
GIRLS AND THE PARENTS THAT
DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
>> Stephen: BACHMANN, OF
COURSE, ALWAYS STRONGLY
PRO-CHOICE, AS LONG AS THAT
CHOICE IS CERVICAL CANCER.
BESIDES, WE ALL KNOW, FOLKS, WE
ALL KNOW...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WE ALL KNOW WHAT GETTING THIS
VACCINATION IS GOING TO LEAD.
TO
>> SOME CONSERVATIVES THINK THAT
BY GIVING A YOUNG GIRL THIS
VACCINATION, IT ENCOURAGES HER
TO HAVE PREMARITAL SEX.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE FOUR DAUGHTERS.
AND IF I SAID TO MY DAUGHTER,
LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A
SHOT, THIS IS TO PREVENT YOU
FROM GETTING SICK FROM WHEN YOU
ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE, SHE'S SMART
GIRL.
I REALLY DON'T THINK SHE WOULD
TAKE THAT AS ME SAYING, SWEETIE,
GO AHEAD AND HAVE SEX.
>> YOU ARE LIVING IN A DREAM
WORLD, YOU WHORE FACTORY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I AM TELLING YOU, I AM
TELLING YOU, THE ONLY THING
KEEPING OUR KIDS FROM HUMPING AT
THE BUS STOP IS FEAR OF THE BIG
"C."
YOU LET THE GOVERNMENT MANDATE A
VACCINE THAT HELPS PREVENT ONE
FORM OF CERVICAL CANCER, AND YOU
MIGHT AS WELL LET THE U.N.'S
JACKBOOTED THUGS HOLD DOWN YOUR
LITTLE PRINCESS AND INJECT HER
WITH PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE SLUT
JUICE.
GIVING YOUR GIRL THIS VACCINE IS
ADMITTING THAT ONE DAY IN THE
FUTURE SHE MAY HAVE PREMARITAL
OR POST MARITAL SEX.
AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S FINE
WITH YOU.
WELL, I WILL NOT SAY THAT TO MY
CHILDREN.
HELL, I WILL NOT SAY THAT TO MY
GRANDCHILDREN.
I WILL SAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
GOT HERE.
ASK YOUR PARENTS.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, AFTER THE DEBATE,
MICHELE BACHMANN RAISED AN EVEN
MORE DISTURBING ISSUE WITH THIS
VACCINE.
>> A WOMAN CAME UP CRYING TO ME
TONIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE.
SHE SAID HER DAUGHTER WAS GIVEN
THAT FACT SEEN.
SHE TOLD ME HER DAUGHTER
SUFFERED MENTAL RETARDATION AS A
RESULT OF THAT VACCINE.
THERE ARE VERY DANGEROUS
CONSEQUENCES.
>> Stephen: THAT IS DAMNING
NEWS FOR THIS VACCINE.
WE SHOULD GET A SECOND OPINION.
>> THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF
PEDIATRICS, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY
OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AND THE
C.D.C. ALL WEIGHED IN TODAY,
DISAGREEING WITH MICHELE
BACHMANN'S VIEWS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO WHAT I'M HEARING HERE IS THAT
THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT IN THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ON THIS
ISSUE.
ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE THE FULL
WEIGHT OF THE MEDICAL AND SIGN
SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT.
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE
MICHELE BACHMANN CITING STUDIES
IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF
SOME LADY I JUST MET.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I SAY...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I SAY, IF THAT'S THE CASE, I SAY
WE TEACH THE CONTROVERSY: SHOULD
WE BE PREVENTING CERVICAL CANCER
OR NOT?
THAT WILL BE A TOUGH CALL FOR
PRESIDENT BACHMANN'S FIRST
APPOINTEE, SURGEON GENERAL GUY
BEHIND HER AT THE PETCO CHECKOUT
LINE.
WE'LL
