IT'S JUST TO THROW THE NONERIC BOLLINGS OFF THE SCENT.
NOW NATION, AS YOU KNOW I HAVE A CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MAIN MAN HERMAN CAIN.
I LOVE HIM TOO.
HE'S MY BROTHER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER.
MY SISTER FROM ANOTHER MISTER, MY UNCLE CHUCK-YEAR FROM ANOTHER-- OH CHUCKY DUCKY!
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW FOLKS, WHO CAN FORGET WHEN WE RAISED CAIN TOGETHER AT OUR ROCK ME
LIKE A HERMAN CAIN RALLY IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
JUST LIKE AN ACTUAL HURRICANE THAT LEFT EVERYONE IN TEARS AND WONDERING WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.
I'VE ALWAYS EXPECTED CAIN FROM HIS 999 TAX PLAN TO HIS VISION OF QUOTING POCKE
MONDAY TO LETTING HIS CAMPAIGN BE RUN BUT ITS SAVVYIST OF HIGHWAY DRIFTERS.
CAIN DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE BUT I'M PROUD TO REPORT IS HE STILL 100% COMMITTED TO
FIXING AMERICA CA CAIN'S CONNECTION PACK.
NOW THEY JUST DROPPED THEIR FIRST AD, FOLKS.
SPOILER ALERT T IS A HER HERMASTERPIECE.
JIM?
>> THIS IS THE ECONOMY.
THIS IS 9 ECONOMY ON STIMULUS.
ANY QUESTIONS?
(LAUGHTER) ANY QUESTIONS!
>> Stephen: NOPE.
NO QUESTIONS HERE.
COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD IT UNFORTUNATELY, OTHER PEOPLE DID HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE DID
HERMAN CAIN COMMIT GOLDFISH MURDER?
>> NO HE DID NOT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
AS HIS CAME PAIN POSTAGE ON THE TUBE, THE GOLDFISH IS FINE BUT OUR ECONOMY ISN'T.
SEE T WASN'T KILLED T WAS MERELY TORTURED.
AND NOT NEARLY ASTOR TURDZ AS THE METAPHOR IN THE AD.
WELL, FOLK, THE REVIEWS ARE IN AND PEOPLE ARE CALLING HERMAN CAIN THE NEW ANDY
WARHOL AND NOT JUST BECAUSE HIS 15 MINUTES MAY BE UP.
JIM?
>> PRETTY BRUTAL VIDEO, IF YOU LOOK AT IT.
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S VERY CREATIVE.
>> IT'S A LITTLE BIT FILM NOIR WITH A SPRINKLE OF POST APOCALYPSE, IT'S A GRIM
MESSAGE INDEED THAT EVEN COMES COMPLETE WITH WITH THE FOREBODING CAW OF A RAVEN.
IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT HE AND HIS TEAM HAVE CREATE A NEW VIDEO GENRE, BRENDA, THE
POLITICAL AVANT-GARDE.
>> Stephen: YES, A VAND GUARD CAIN IS PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT CAN BE
CALLED A POLITICAL AD.
JUST AS HE ONCE PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT CAN BE CALLED PIZZA.
AND CAIN KNOWS, QAIN KNOWS THE A VAND GUARD IS ABOUT CONFRONTING PRECONCEIVED BOURGE WHAT NECESSARY
NOTIONS OF POLITICAL MESSAGING.
IN CASE THE STIMULUS WHICH NO ONE HAS REALLY TALKED ABOUT FOR A YEAR HAPPENED.
THE GOLDFISH IS A METAPHOR FOR OUR ECONOMY CAUGHT IN THE GRIP OF A CAPRICIOUS AND
CRUEL UNIVERSE REPRESENTED BY A LITTLE GIRL, A FEROCIOUS FRAGILITY IN THE
BAR REN LANDSCAPE OF DECAY TOYING WITH LIFE'S DUALITY AS BOTH CRITIC AND CRIMINAL,
AND I GOT ALL OF THAT FROM HER BANGS.
FINALLY--  (APPLAUSE) FINALLY, IN A THOUGHT-FREE AND DAY-- DENAWMENT OF CAIN ON A GRASSY LEDGE
OVERLOOKING THE 18th HOLE OF MADNESS, OF COURSE THAT IS JUST ONE INTERPRETATION.
ANOTHER COULD BE THAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAS SWITCHED WHAT HE IS SMOKING.
EITHER WAY, FOLKS, I WAS SO INSPIRED BY CAIN'S ART ATTACK OR ART-TACCK ADDS
THAT I CHUGGED A BOTTLE OF ROBITUSSIN, PUNCHED MYSELF IN THE TIFERP EL WITH A
PORCELAIN COW CREAMER AND MADE AN AVANT-GARDE AD OF MY OWN ABOUT ALL THE THINGS WE
FORGOT WE USED TO BE MAD ABOUT.
JIM?
>> LET'S SHATTER SOME PARADIGM.
>> THIS IS THE ECONOMY.
THIS IS THE ECONOMY ON REGULATIONS.
THIS IS CONTRACEPTION.
THIS IS THE AUTO BAILOUT.
THIS IS GAY MARRIAGE.
BANJOS, THIS IS A MEXICAN BORDER.
SOCIALISM, THIS IS GRANDMA,
IN A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE.
ANY QUESTIONS!
>> Stephen: ANY QUESTIONS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BALLS IN YOUR COURT, HERMAN KANE, AND I WANT TO ASSURE
MY VIEWERS THAT IN CATS WERE
