NATION, PLEASE, PLEASE.
WE ARE IN THE HOMESTRETCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE
MID-TERM ELECTIONS ARE NEXT
TUESDAY, WHEREAS I'VE BEEN
TELLING MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS,
NEXT WEDNESDAY.
( LAUGHTER )
EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH,
FOLKS.
YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT
POUNDING IN YOUR HEART.
OR IF YOU'RE A LIBERAL ACTIVIST
AT A RANSD -- RAND PAUL RALLY,
POUNDING ON YOUR HEAD.
( LAUGHTER )
LET ME EXPLAIN.
IT SEEMS LAUREN VALLE, A
115-POUND FEMALE MOVEON.ORG
ACTIVIST GOT HER CRANIUM
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO RAND PAUL
OUTSIDE A KENTUCKY DEBATE, BUT
LUCKILY TWO MEN HAD THE COURAGE
TO THROW HER TO THE GROUND AND
HOLD HER DOWN WHILE A THIRD HERO
STOMPED ON HER MELLON.
IT'S HER OWN DAMN FAULT, FOLKS.
EVERYONE KNOWS IF YOU DON'T WANT
SOMEONE TO STEP ON YOUR FACE AT
TEA PARTY RALLY, YOU CARRY FLAG
THAT SAYS "DON'T TREAD ON ME."
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOR.
( APPLAUSE )
NOW...
( LAUGHTER )
GOD, I WISH I COULD.
NOW, I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW
THAT THE STOMPEE IS DOING FINE
AND SO IS HER CONCUSSION AND
THAT THE STOMPER, RAND PAUL
CAMPAIGN COUNTY COORDINATOR TIM
PROFITT HAS APOLOGIZED, TELLING
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, "I'M SORRY
IT CAME TO THAT, AND I APOLOGIZE
IF IT APPEARED OVERLY FORCEFUL,
BUT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT RAND'S
SAFETY."
SEE, HE'S SORRY ABOUT ALL OF IT,
EXCEPT FOR STOMPING ON HER HEAD.
AND MR. PROFITT, WHO REFUSED TO
ALLOW HIS FACE ON CAMERA, TOLD A
LOCAL TELEVISION STATION HE
WANTS SOMETHING FROM HER.
>> I WOULD LIKE FOR HER TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME, TO BE HONEST.
>> Stephen: YEAH, HE COULD
HAVE HURT HIS FOOT.
I DOUBT HER SKULL PROVIDES VERY
GOOD ARCH SUPPORT.
AND MR. PROFITT HAD AN EXCELLENT
REASON FOR BOOT-JACKING HER
CRANIUM.
>> I ACTUALLY PUT MY FOOT ON HER
TO... I COULDN'T BEND OVER
BECAUSE I HAVE ISSUES WITH MY
BACK.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HE HAD TO STOMP ON HER.
IF HE BENDS OVER TO PUNCH A GIRL
IN THE FACE, HE MIGHT SLIP A
DISC.
THAT'S WHY YOU ALWAYS STOMP WITH
THE KNEES, NEVER WITH THE BACK.
( LAUGHTER )
OR BETTER YET, USE ONE OF THESE
REACHER STOMPERS.
STAY DOWN!
STAY DOWN!
STAY DOWN!
