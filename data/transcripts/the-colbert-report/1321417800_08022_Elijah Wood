(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE STAR OF
"HAPPY FEET 2."
JIM?
>> THIS IS JUST ONE BIG OLD FOOT
AFTER THE OTHER.
NO ONE WILL LAUGH AT YOU, I
PROMISE.
COME ON.
♪ I DON'T CARE WHAT THE PEOPLE
SAY... ♪
>> ALL YOU'VE GOT TO THE DO IS
FEEL THE BEAT.
>> AND THAT IS THE ONLY MOVIE WE
WILL TALK ABOUT.
PLEASE WELCOME ELIJAH WOOD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ELIJAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME TONIGHT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING
YOU DID.
>> THAT EFFECT COST US $285
MILLION.
I'M SURE I'LL MAKE IT BACK.
>> WE'RE ALL IN.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, I'M A
LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE
CLIP WE JUST SHOWED.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU PLAY A
PENGUIN.
IN THIS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE REPRISING THE
ROLE OF MUMBLES.
>> CORRECT.
MUMBLE.
>> Stephen: MUMBLE.
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
ONE AT A TIME, THAT'S FINE.
(LAUGHTER)
MUMBLE FROM "HAPPY FEET" THIS IS
"HAPPY FEET 2."
I NOTICED IN THAT SHOT THERE OF
YOU WITH THE OTHER PENGUINS IT'S
WET ON THE ICE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT GLOBAL WARMING.
(LAUGHTER)
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT DRIVING MY AUDI
A-8.
>> IT'S CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> Stephen: OH, IS IT NOW?
REALLY?
IS THERE CLIMATE CHANGE IN
THERE?
>> THERE IS, A LITTLE BIT.
>> Stephen: WOULDN'T THAT MAKE
PENGUINS HAPPY.
S THAT WHY YOUR FEET ARE SO
HAPPY?
IT'S WARMER DOWN THERE FOR THEM.
IT MUST BE TERRIBLE.
I SAW THAT "MARCH OF THE
PENGUINS THING."
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
>> BUT THEY'RE USED TO IT.
>> Stephen: YOU EVER EAT A
PENGUIN.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE CHICKEN
FISH.
(LAUGHTER)
DELICIOUS.
>> I IMAGINE.
>> Stephen: A LITTLE OILY,
PERHAPS?
DO YOU GET TIRED OF PEOPLE GOING
"HEY, YOU'RE THE PENGUIN FROM
HAPPY FEET!
"
>> THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HEY IT'S THE KID
FROM "ICE STORM."
>> RIGHT!
>> Stephen: IT'S THE
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SET, REALLY, THAT
WOULD HAVE EVER RECOGNIZED ME
FROM "HAPPY FEET."
THEY WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE ME
ANYWAY.
THEIR PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO SAY
"HE'S THE GUY IN HAPPY FEET."
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU ACT SO
WELL WE CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU'RE
THAT PENGUIN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> RIGHT!
I DISAPPEAR INTO THAT ROLE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU DO ANY...
METHOD?
DID YOU HANG OUT WITH PENGUINS
FOR A WHILE?
GET INTO IT AT ALL?
>> THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE
REHEARSAL PERIOD IN ANTARCTICA.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO CLUTCH
AN EGG BETWEEN YOUR LEGS?
>> THERE WAS ALSO HUDDLE... WHEN
THE PENGUINS HAVE TO... THEY
HAVE TO HUDDLE AGAINST THE COLD
DURING THE HARSH WINTER, THERE
WAS HUDDLE TRAINING.
HUDDLING TOGETHER.
>> THAT WILL COME IN HANDY FOR
THOSE OCCUPY WALL STREET PEOPLE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WINTER IS COMING.
>> Stephen: WINTER IS COMING.
ABSOLUTELY.
NOW, LISTEN, I RESISTED AS LONG
AS I CAN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I'M ABOUT TO BREAK.
I'M A FAN OF "LORD OF THE RINGS"
MOVIES.
>> I'VE HEARD THIS.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE... YOU
HAVE SOMETHING HERE.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING DOWN THERE.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE HERE?
>> I HAVE STING.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
>> FROM THE FILMS.
>> Stephen: DAMN.
(APPLAUSE)
NOW THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU...
THAT YOU... THAT YOU... MAY I?
>> PLEASE.
>> Stephen: IT'S GOT EDGE ON IT
THERE.
>> A LITTLE SHARP.
THEY MAKE THEM FOR REAL.
>> Stephen: IS THIS THE ONE YOU
CARRIED THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE?
>> YES, THAT'S ONE OF THEM.
WE HAD A COUPLE.
THAT WAS HERO SWORD IF IT WERE
EVER TO BE SHOT IN CLOSEUP.
>> Stephen: EITHER THAT ONE OR
MAYBE THIS ONE THAT...
(LAUGHTER)
THAT PETER JACKSON GAVE TO ME.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M JUST AS
MUCH FRODO AS YOU ARE.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I'VE GOT...
WOULD YOU MIND IF WE JUST
LET'S...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
... THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER BEEN IN A SWORD FIGHT.
NOT IN LONG, THOUGH.
NOW YOU'RE ALSO IN "THE HOW
ABOUT" MOVIE COMING OUT NEXT
YEAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO GO
BACK DOWN?
>> I WAS JUST DOWN THERE ABOUT A
MONTH.
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO VISIT.
THEY'RE SHOOTING UNTIL JUNE SO I
WANT TO BE THERE.
>> Stephen: IF YOU SEE HIM WILL
YOU GIVE HIM A NOTE FOR ME?
>> I WILL.
>> Stephen: MORGAN DAHLY.
>> IAN McKEL LANN FOR YOU?
>> Stephen: I COULD TELL HE WAS
A HUMAN.
HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A MYAR.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: DID I JUST THROW
DOWN.
>> YOU DID.
>> Stephen: DID YOU MEET
RATAGAS.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T... I CAN'T
SAY ANYTHING.
I WENT DOWN THERE AND I KNOW
THINGS AND I CAN'T TELL.
I KNOW THINGS, YOU ARE THINGS.
IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY... I KNOW
THINGS ABOUT THAT MOVIE THAT I
WANT TO BROADCAST.
I...
>> WE NEED TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION.
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT IN JUST A
MINUTE.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A
SECOND AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT
THESE THINGS PEOPLE WON'T GET TO
KNOW ABOUT.
ELIJAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ELIJAH WOOD, "HAPPY FEET 2" IT'S
IN THEATER THIS IS FRIDAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
