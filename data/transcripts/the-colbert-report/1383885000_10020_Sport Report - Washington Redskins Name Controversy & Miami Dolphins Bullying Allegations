>> Stephen: NATION, I CANNOTBEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH
OF OUR CHILDHOOD WAS SPENTON THE GRIDIRON BECAUSE I
HAVE NO RECOLLECTION, SHOULDHAVE WORN A HELMET.
AND MY FAVORITE NFL TEAM ISALWAYS BEEN THE WASHINGTON
REDSKINS.
BUT MY TEAM IS FACING SOMEUNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS FROM
THE PC POLICE.
>> WILL THE WASHINGTONREDSKINS BE FORCED TO CHANGE
ITS NAME.
AT A MEETING EARLIER THISWEEK LEADERS THERE THE
UNITED INDIAN NATION ASKEDTHE NFL TO SANCTION TEAM
OWNER DANIEL SNYDER FORCONTINUING TO USE WHAT THEY
CALL A RACIAL SLUR.
>> FOR US, THE R WORD IS THE"N" WORD.
>> WRONG.
IT'S IF THE R WORD WAS THE"N" WORD I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO SAY IT ON THE AIR, WATCHTHIS, REDSKIN REDSKIN
REDSKIN.

APOLOGIZE, NO, I WROTE THE"N" WORD AGAIN, APOLOGIZE.
THERE YOU GO.

ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, THANKYOU.
ANYWAY, REDSKINS TEAM OWNERDAN SNYDER HAS DEFENDED
KEEPING THE NAME BY CITING ARECENT AP POLL THAT FOUND
THAT 79% OF AMERICANS ARE INFAVOR OF KEEPING THE NAME.
21% WANT THE REDSKINS TOCHANGE IT BUT I BET THOSE
ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WANTTO CHANGE THE NAME OF POTATO
SKINS FOR OFFENDING THEIRISH.
BUT FOLKS, IN AN OPEN LETTERTO FANS SNYDER EXPLAINED I
WAS BORN A FAN OF THEWASHINGTON REDSKINS.
THAT TRADITION, THE SONG,THE CHEER, IT MATTERS SO
MUCH TO ME AS A CHILD.
IT ISN'T JUST WHERE WE CAMEFROM, IT'S WHO WE ARE.
YES, OUR PAST IS WHO WE ARE,WE REDSKIN FANS ARE PRONE TO
THIS LAND SINCE 19-- 33.
NOW STRANGERS THREATEN OURSACRED GROUND WHERE WE FEAST
ON THE FOOD OF OUR ANCESTORS,THE $14 HOT DOG.
AND DON OUR CEREMONIAL DRESS,WIGS AND RUBBER PIG NOSES
THAT SYMBOLIZE OUR PROUDTRADITION OF, I DON'T
ACTUALLY KNOW WHY WE DO THAT.
BUT FOLKS, THIS TRADITION ISBEING ATTACKED AND IT'S NOT
THE ONLY THING TURNING THISBRAIN SCRAMBLING GAME UGLY.
>> THE MIAMI DOLPHINS HAVEINDEFINITELY SUSPENDED A
PLAYER OVER ACCUSATIONS OFBULLYING.
THE DOLPHINS ANNOUNCED THATTHE OFFENSIVE GUARD RICHIE
INCOGNITO SUSPENSION SHORTLYBEFORE MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT.
JONATHAN MARTIN LEFT THETEAM LAST WEEK AFTER AN
INCIDENT IN THE LUNCHROOMWHERE TEAMMATE ITS
REPORTEDLY GOT UP AND LEFTTHE TABLE AS SOON AS HE SAT
DOWN.
>> I BET THEY ALSO MADE FUNOF HIM FOR WEARING CLOTHES
WITH DOLPHINS ON THEM.
(LAUGHTER)SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND
THE REPORT'S DEEPESTSYMPATHYES TO THE VICTIM,
RICHIE INCOGNITO.
IF ONLY HE HAD A WAY TO HIDEHIS IDENTITY RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN EVER SINCE THIS STORYBROKE, FOLKS, INCOG NILT OWE
HAS BEEN PUSHED AROUND BYTHE KINDNESS CABAL JUST
BECAUSE HE LEFT MARTIN THISVOICE-MAIL.
>> HEY, WAZUP YOU HALF NWORD PIECE OF BLANK.

MOUTH.
I'M GOING TO SLAP YOUR REALMOTHER ACROSS THE FACE,
BLANK YOU.
YOU'RE STILL A ROOKIE.
I'LL KILL YOU.
>> Stephen: PERSONALLY, ITHINK IT'S NICE HE PICKED UP
THE PHONE.
(LAUGHTER)TOO MANY PEOPLE THESE DAYS
JUST TEXT THEIR THREATS TOCRAP IN YOUR MOUTH.
NOW FOLKS, I'M NOT THE ONLYONE PROTECTING RICHIE'S
BLINDSIDE.
HE'S ALSO GOT THE SUPPORT OFFOX NEWS ANALYST AND STAR OF
THE PROBLEM CHILD MOVIEDR. CARL'S CARLSON, JIM?
>> LOOK,�i I'M IN TOTALSYMPATHY WITH ANYBODY
SNUBBED BY ANYBODY ANDAGAINST HUMAN CRUELTY AND
AGAINST BULLYING.
BUT IT A LITTLE ODD THAT THEPURPOSE OF THE GAME IS TO GO
OUT AND KILL PEOPLE BUT YOUGET IN TROUBLE FOR BEING
RUDE TO SOMEONE AT LUNCH.
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT,FOOTBALL IS ABOUT MURDERING
PEOPLE.
YOU GET SIX POINTS PER KILLPLUS AN EXTRA POINT IF THEY
TAKE THEIR SEVERED HEADTHROUGH THE UPRIGHT.
AND THERE IS ALSO SOMENONSENSE ABOUT CROSSING A
LINE AND OF WHAT EVER DOWNSARE BUT ONCE PEOPLE STOP
DYING THAT'S WHEN I GORECHEESE MY NACHOS.
FOLKS, DR. CARLSONUNDERSTANDS THIS GETS TO A
DEEPER PROBLEM IN OURSOCIETY.
AND BY THE WAY, LET'S BEHONEST, THIS BULLYING THING,
IT IS A FAD, JUST LIKESELF-ESTEEM, JUST LIKE, YOU
KNOW, LOW CASH DIETS ORWHATEVER T IS MASS HYSTERIA,
WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUTBULLYING.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BEINGWORRIED ABOUT BULLYING IS
JUST A FAD LIKE POODLESKIRTS OR SEPARATE WATER
FOUNTAINS, GET OVER IT.
WHAT DOW REALLY WHEN YOUTHINK ABOUT T THIS ISN'T
EVEN BULLYING, IT IS REALLYHAZING.
MARTIN WAS A ROOKIE ANDROOKIES HAVE TO PAY THEIR
DUES.
THEN NEXT YEAR HE HAS THEPRIVILEGE OF THREATENING TO
CRAP IN SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH.
IT'S ALL BEING A ROLE MODEL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
