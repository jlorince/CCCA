>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MY GUEST TONIGHT BELIEVES
CORPORATE CULTURE SHOULD PROMOTE
EMPLOYEE HAPPINESS.
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS TELL MY
STAFF TO SMILE OR THEY'RE FIRED.
[LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME TONY HSIEH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY MR. HSIEH THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING UP YOU ARE THE C.E.O. OF
ZAPPOS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU GET YOUR SHOES THERE.
YOU RETAIL CLOTHING?
>> EVEN HANDBAGS KITCHEN WEAR,
HOUSEWARES.
A WHOLE BUNCH OF CATEGORIES.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE SELLING
HAPPINESS.
>> YES STAOEFRPBLGT THE NAME OF
BOOK IS "DELIVERING HAPPY HAPPINESS:
A PATH TO PROFIT PASSION AND
PURPOSE."
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT MONEY CAN'T
BUY HAPPINESS.
I'VE LONG SUSPECTED IT WAS A
LIE.
ARE YOU TELLING ME I'M RIGHT?
>> WE TALKED ABOUT A BUSINESS
MODEL IN THE BOOK.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS HAPPINESS
AS A PWOD MODEL, MAKING
CUSTOMERS HAPPY, MAKING
EMPLOYEES HAPPY.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TEN
IDEAS, CORPS VALUES YOU LIVE BY
AT ZAPPOS.
NUMBER ONE, DELIVER WOW!
[LAUGHTER]
THROUGH SERVICE SO YOU ARE NOT
JUST SENDING ME SHOES BEGUN YOU
ARE SENDING ME WOW.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN SELLING OR DELIVERING WOW?
>> PART OF IT IS WE OFFER FREE
SHIPPING BOTH WAYS SO A LOT OF
CUSTOMERS ORDER TEN DIFFERENT
PAIRS OF SHOES, TRYING THEM ON
IN THE COMFORT OF THE LIVING
ROOM AND WE PAY FOR THE SHIPPING
BACK.
KIND OF LIKE NETFLIX FOR SHOES
OR CLOTHES.
WE HAVE A 365 RETURN POLICY FOR
PEOPLE THAT NEED MORE TIME
COMMITTING OR MAKING UP THEIR
MINDS.
FOR MOST OF THE LOYAL CUT OF MES
WE PROMISE THEY GET THEIR ORDER
IN A WEEK BUT FOR MOST WE DO A
SURPRISE UPGRADE TO OVERNIGHT
SHIPPING.
THE SHOES SHOW UP EIGHT HOURS
LATER AND THAT CREATES THAT
WHOLE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE
NEED JOBS RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR IN A ZAPPOS
EMPLOYEE?
YOU SAY THAT YOU VALUE
WEIRDNESS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A GUY WHO
COMES IN WITH A PET SNAKE AROUND
HIS SHOULDERS AND STARTS RAPPING
RAPPING -- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
WEIRDNESS?
>> WELL, WE DO TWO SETS OF
INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE WE HIRE.
THE FIRST IS STANDARD STUFF
LOOKING FOR SKILLS, EXPERIENCE,
AND SO ON.
THE SECOND SET IS A CULTURE FIT.
FOR EACH OF TEN CORE VALUES ONE
OF THEM IS WHICH CREATE FUN AND
A LITTLE WEIRDNESS.
WE HAVE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR
THEM.
THE KEY WORD THERE IS A LITTLE
WEIRDNESS.
>> Steve: PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED
TO HAVE COSTUME PARADES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE SPEND THE
NIGHT AT YOUR HOUSE, IS THAT
TRUE?
OCCASIONALLY.
OKAY IS THIS A CULT?
ARE YOU DEAR LEADER FATHER OF A
KRULT?
DO YOU HAVE CHILD BRIDES?
HOW MUCH CONTROL DO YOU HAVE
OVER THOSE PEOPLE?
>> THAT'S WHY WE CAME UP WITH
OUR LIST OF TEN CORPS VALUES.
IF YOU DO A GOOGLE LIST YOU CAN
SEE WHAT THEY ARE AND IT'S NOT
MYSELF OUT THERE HIRING PEOPLE.
IT'S ACTUALLY EVERYONE IN THE
COMPANY KNOWS WHAT THE CORPS
VALUES ARE.
AND THEY HELP, THEY MAKE THE
BUSINESS DECISIONS BASED ON THE
CORPS VALUES IN TERMS OF WHAT IS
RIGHT FOR THE COMPANY AND
CUSTOMERS.
>> Stephen: THE TPHOERBGTS
SAYS AT TIMES MR. HSIEH COMES
ACROSS AS AN ALIEN WHO HAS STUD
YOU'D HUMAN BEINGS IN ORDER TO
LIVE AMONG THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> IT IS PARTIALLY TRUE.
>> Stephen: ARE WE MAKING NEWS
RIGHT NOW?
>> TONIGHT ON THIS SHOW I'M --
NO, ACTUALLY IN DELIVERING
HAPPINESS THERE'S A SECTION THAT
TALKS ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF
HAPPINESS.
THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY
INTERESTING PART OF PSYCHOLOGY
THAT I STARTED READING UP
THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING
PARTS FROM THE RESEARCH THAT YOU
CAN APPLY TO NOT ONLY YOUR OWN
PERSONAL LIFE TO BUSINESS AS
WELL IN TERMS OF MAKING
CUSTOMERS HAPPIER AND EMPLOYEES
HAPPY.
PEOPLE FOUND THAT HAVING
PERCEIVED PROGRESS IS AN
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF HAPPINESS
OR HAVING PERCEIVED CONTROL,
BEING PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER
THAN YOURSELF THAT HAS MEANING
TO YOU.
THOSE ARE ALL THINGS WE TRY TO
INCORPORATE INTO OUR CULTURE AT
ZAPPOS.
>> Stephen: WHEN YOU SAY
DELIVERING HAPPINESS, WHY IS --
THAT'S MAKING HAPPINESS VERY
IMPORTANT.
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK HAPPINESS IS OVERRATED.
OKAY.
AS A CATHOLIC, I'VE BEEN
TAUGHT --
[LAUGHTER]
-- I'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO VALUE
SUFFERING.
[LAUGHTER]
CAN YOU DELIVER SUFFERING?
>> I'M REALLY GLAD YOU ASKED
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THAT'S
ACTUALLY A COMMON RESPONSE WE
GET ESPECIALLY FROM THE BUSINESS
WORLD WHERE REALLY THE MENTALITY
IS WHERE WE SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON
PROFITS AND HAPPINESS HAS NO
PLACE IN THE WORK PLACE.
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IF
EMPLOYEES ARE CAPPER AND
CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPIER THAT THAT
ACTUALLY DRIVES BUSINESS RESULTS
AND THOSE BUSINESSES TEND TO OUT
PERFORM PEERS IN THE LONG RUN
FOR EXAMPLE, EVERYONE KNOWS
ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN EMPLOYEE
ENGAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE
PRODUCTIVITY, ONE OF THE BEST
PREDICTORS OF THAT IS WHETHER
YOU HAVE A BEST FRIEND AT WORK
OR A NUMBER OF FRIENDS AT WORK.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF YOU DON'T
LET ANYBODY MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH YOU?
>> IF THAT'S THE CULTURE OF THE
COMPANY THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE THE
BEST LOOKING COMPANY IN THE
WORLD.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT.
>> Stephen: MR. HSIEH, ARE YOU
HAPPY WITH HOW THIS INTERVIEW
HAS GONE?
SO.
>> FAR, YES.
ARE YOU?
>> Stephen: IF YOU ARE HAPPY,
THEN I'M HAPPY.
MR. HSIEH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
TONY HSIEH, HIS BOOK IS
"DELIVERING HAPPINESS."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
