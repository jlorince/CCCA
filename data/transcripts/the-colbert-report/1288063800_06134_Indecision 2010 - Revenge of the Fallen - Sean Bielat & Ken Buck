GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.
THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS ARE JUST
A WEEK AWAY, SO IT'S TIME FOR
ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF...
"INDECISION 2010: REVENGE OF THE
FALLEN."
>> DEMOCRATS ARE SUCH EASY PREY.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, COME
NOVEMBER 2, REPUBLICANS ARE
GOING TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK
THEN HOPEFULLY LICK IT SO IT'S
THEIRS FOREVER.
AND HOW ARE REPUBLICANS DOING IT
IN THEY'RE DOING IT LIKE THEY
ALWAYS DO, BY TALKING ABOUT GAY
STUFF.
( LAUGHTER )
TAKE MASSACHUSETTS REPUBLICAN
SEAN BIELAT, WHO IS CHALLENGING
15-TERM CONGRESSMAN BARNEY
FRANK.
NOW FRANK, OF COURSE, AN I'M NOT
OUTING ANYBODY HERE, IS OPENLY
DEMOCRATIC.
COULD HURT HIM THIS ELECTION.
OH, AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S
GAY.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, BIELAT IS NO FRIEND OF THE
GAYS.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL," BIELAT COMPARED
GAYS TO SHORT PEOPLE, SAYING,
"MEN UNDER THE HEIGHT OF FIVE
FEET TWO CAN'T SERVE.
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY PROTESTING.
WHERE ARE THE SHORT GUYS
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE WHITE
HOUSE.
YOU DON'T SEE IT.
( LAUGHTER )
GOOD POINT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T SEE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE
USUALLY BELOW THE CAMERAS.
( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I AGREE WITH BIELAT HERE.
BEING GAY IS JUST LIKE BEING
SHORT IN THAT BOTH ARE CHOICES
AND BOTH CAN BE CURED.
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS MUCH,
BUT I MYSELF WENT THROUGH A
SHORT PHASE.
I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF BEING
SHORT AT A PRETTY YOUNG AGE.
SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS OLD, BUT
THROUGH PRAYER AND COUNSELING, I
EVENTUALLY GREW OUT OF IT.
I PROVED THAT YOU CAN CHANGE
YOUR HEIGHT ORIENTATION.
NOW, BIELAT'S NOT THE ONLY
REPUBLICAN STICKING IT TO THE
GAYS.
COLORADO REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL
CANDIDATE KEN BUCK RECENTLY WENT
ON THE "MEET THE PRESS" TO SHARE
HIS VIEWS ON THE HOMOSEXUALITY.
>> I THINK THAT BIRTH HAS AN
INFLUENCE OVER LIKE ALCOHOLISM
AND SOME OTHER THINGS, BUT I
THINK THAT BASICALLY YOU HAVE A
CHOICE.
>> Stephen: YES.
BEING GAY IS LIKE ALCOHOLISM,
TOO MUCH AND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
SOCIAL GAYNESS.
I MEAN, IN MODERATION.
I MEAN, WHO HASN'T COME HOME
AFTER A LONG DAY AND RELAXED BY
KNOCKING BACK A COUPLE OF COOL
TAL ONES?
( LAUGHTER )
AND I DON'T... I DON'T WANT ANY
LIBERALS OUT THERE TO GO AFTER
THESE TWO FINE MEN FOR BEING
POLITICALLY OPPORTUNISTIC
ELECTION NEAR GAY BAITERS.
