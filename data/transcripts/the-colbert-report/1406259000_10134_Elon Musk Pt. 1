I GET OVER THE THINGS YOUDO.

LARGEST PROVIDER OF SOLARPOWER IN THE UNITED STATES,
SPACE X, TESLA AND PAY PAL,ALSO DESIGNED SOMETHING
CALLED THE HYPERLOOP WHICHCAN TRANSPORT RIDERS FROM
L.A. TO SAN FRANCISCO IN 35MINUTES.
AT WHAT POINT-- (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AT WHAT POINT DOYOU TIP OVER FROM VISIONARY
TO SUPERVILLAIN?
(LAUGHTER)AND WHERE ARE YOU BUILDING
YOUR SECRET MOUNTAIN LAIR.
>> I'M WONDERING THAT MYSELF,ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT I LOVE ABOUTYOU IS THAT YOU SAW THE FUTURE
AS A KID, I IMAGINE, ANDSAID YEAH, LET'S MAKE THAT
HAPPEN.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THEFUTURE YOU'RE GIVING US IS
THE FUTURE THAT I SAW, I SAWX-MEN ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND
WHEN I WALKED OUT TO MYTESLA BECAUSE I HAVE A
TESLA.
AND IT JUST, IT JUST-- THEDOOR HANDLE CAME OUT, AND I
JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS MYFRIEND.
I SAID I DON'T NEED THE DAMNMOVIE, I'VE GOT A CAR.
>> YEAH, WE KIND OF WANT THECAR TO BE YOUR FRIEND,
ACTUALLY.
IN FACT, WITH THE NEWVERSION OF SOFTWARE COMING
OUT YOU WILL GET TO BE ABLETO NAME YOUR CAR.
LIKE IT'S A PET ORSOMETHING.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOUNAME YOUR CAR.
>> WELL, I ACTUALLY, SINCE IHAVE THE ADVANCED SOFTWARE,
I HAVE NAMED MY CAR.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH, I NAMED IT OLDFAITHFUL
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. DON'TNAME IT OLD YELLER
OR YOU'LLHAVE TO SHOOT IT
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY. LET'S TALKABOUT SPACE X FOR A SECOND.
PEOPLE KNOW YOU ALREADY FROMTESLA.
I WANT TO SHOW A LITTLE BITOF FOOTAGE HERE OF ONE OF
THE TEST FLIGHTS YOU HAVEDONE FOR REUSABLE ROCKETS.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: THAT IS ONE OFTHE MOST BAD ASS THINGS I
HAVE EVER SEEN.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THAT, THAT IS
WHAT WE WERE TOLD ROCKETSWERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO
WHEN I WAS READING ALL OFTHOSE '50s SCIENCE FICTION
BOOKS AS A KID.
>> THAT IS WHAT THEY SHOULDDO.
>> Stephen: WHY IS THAT SOIMPORTANT.
>> THE MAIN THING THAT IT ISIMPORTANT IS THAT WE WANT TO
ACHIEVE  FULL REUSABILITY WITHROCKETS.
THE WAY ROCKETS WORK TODAY,THEY ARE SINGLE USE.
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IFYOU HAD AN AIRCRAFT OR CAR
THAT WAS SINGLE USE, NOTMANY PEOPLE WOULD USE IT
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOOEXPENSIVE.
SO WE NEED TO MAKE THEROCKETS COMPLETELY REUSABLE
SUCH THAT YOU JUST NEED TORELOAD PROPELLANT TO FLY
AGAIN.
>> Stephen: THIS SEEMS TO MEIS THE KIND OF ROCKET WE
NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO TOMARS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOUCAN'T GO THERE AND BUILD
ANOTHER ROCKET.
YOU HAVE TO LAND, SUCK SOMEHYDROGEN OUT OF THE WATER
AND SOIL, PACK IT BACK INAND OFF YOU GO.
>> YES.
ACTUALLY, YOU COULDCONCEIVABLY GO TO MARS WITH
AN EXPANDABLE SYSTEM.
BUT YOU WOULD ONLY BE ABLETO SPEND SEND A FEW PEOPLE
MAYBE ON ONE OR TWO MISSIONSAND IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY
ESTABLISH A MARS BASE, THATIS WHERE THE REUSABILITY IS
CRITICAL OTHERWISE IT ISSIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE.
PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TOAFFORD TO MOVE THERE.
>> Stephen: SO MOREIMMEDIATELY THAN GOING TO
MARS, WE'VE GOT TO GET UP TOTHE INTERNATIONAL SPACE
STATION.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND THE RUSKIESSAID NO MORE RIDES FOR YOU,
AMERICANSKIES.
>> I BELIEVE RUSSIA SAIDAMERICA SHOULD USE A
TRAMPOLINE TO GET THERE.
NO JOKE.
THEY DID SAY THAT, KIND OFCRAZY.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE ONLYCOMPANY ACTUALLY SENDING
PAYLOADS UP TO THEINTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
RIGHT NOW.
THE ONLY PRIVATE COMPANYDOING THAT.
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THECOMPANY THAT IS DOING THAT.
>> SPACE X AND THEN-- ORBITALSCIENCES IS OUR COMPETITOR
FOR-- THEY ALSO TAKE CARGOTO THE SPACE STATION.
>> Stephen: SO OF TWO YOUARE DOING IT.
>> YES, ALTHOUGH WE'RE THEONLY COMPANY THAT BRINGS
STUFF BACK IN TERMS OF CARGOBACK.
>> Stephen: SO IF I WEREGOING TO GO UP, I WOULD WANT
TO GO WITH YOU GUYS.
>> YES, IF YOU WANT THERETURN JOURNEY.
>> Stephen: I DON'T WANT AONE WAY TICKET.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT THERUSSIANS HAVE SAID THEY'RE
TO THE GOING TO GIVE USRIDES ANY MORE, HOW GOOD IS
THAT FOR YOU.
CAN YOU STEP UP AND TAKEOVER FOR ITS MANNED FLIGHTS?
>> I MEAN, ARGUABLY, WITHENEMIES LIKE THAT, WHO NEEDS
FRIENDS.
BUT YEAH, I SUPPOSE RUSSIAIS BEING HELPFUL, YEAH-- .
>> Stephen: DID YOU THINK ABOUTSPENDING THEM SOME FLOWERS,.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG BEFOREYOU ARE SENDING MEN UP OR
WOMEN.
>> YEAH, SO WE-- WE HOPE TOBE SENDING PEOPLE UP IN
ABOUT 2 TO 3 YEARS WITH DRAGONVERSION 2, THE
SPACECRAFT IS ABLE TO LANDPROPULSIVELY AND WITH
PRECISION.
>> Stephen: LIKE THAT THINGJUST DID.
>> YEAH, SIMILAR TO THATALTHOUGH IT HAS 8 SIDE
MOUNTED THRUSTERS AND USESDIFFERENTIAL THROTTLING FOR
CONTROL INSTEAD OF THE MAINENGINE.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVETO TELL ME
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: CAN YOU HANG ON
A SECOND?
I WANT TO TALK MORE HERE FORA SECOND.
WE HAVE TO TAKE A COMMERCIALBREAK.
