>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
FEMINIST ICON AND THE
SUBJECT OF A NEW HBO
DOCUMENTARY.
AND IT'S ONLY 75% AS LONG AS
DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT MEN.
PLEASE WELCOME GLORIA
STEINHAM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GLORIA, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
HOW ARE YOU DOING.
>> VERY GOOD.
>> Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO
INTRODUCE YOU, YOU ARE A
FEMINIST ICON.
>> NO, NO, NO,.
>> Stephen: NO, YOU ARE, YOU
ARE A FEMINIST ICON.
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WEAR
PICTURES OF YOU AROUND THEIR
NECK.
>> BUT ICON IS REALLY
DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEN YOU
GET AN ICONOCLAST.
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA WZ.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE ATTACK
YOU FOR BEING AN ICON AND
HERE WE GO.
>> OKAY, OKAY I'M READY.
>> Stephen: THIS DOCUMENTARY
IS GLORIA IN HER OWN WORDS.
WHY DO YOU NEED TO EXPRESS
YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN WORDS?
ARE YOU MISINTERPRETED BY
OTHER PEOPLE?
>> PROBABLY.
AND PROBABLY THAT WILL GO
RIGHT ON BECAUSE IT IS IN MY
OWN WORDS.
BUT IT'S JUST MORE INTIMATE,
I THINK.
BECAUSE YOU-- WELL, HERE'S
WHAT HAPPENS.
THEY ASK ME QUESTIONS AND I
TRIED TO ANSWER AS HONESTLY
AS I COULD.
AND THEN THEY CREATED A
DOCUMENTARY AROUND IT.
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE JUMPING
OFF A CLIFF, YOU KNOW.
AND IT TURNED OUT AMAZINGLY
WELL.
>> IT'S A GREAT DOCUMENTARY.
>> IT REALLY IS A WINDOW
INTO A TIME WHEN SEXISM
EXISTED.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT NOW EVERYTHING'S EQUAL.
THERE'S SPANKS FOR MEN NOW.
>> THERE ARE, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT.
>> THERE R THERE ARE SPANKS
FOR MEN, TRUST ME.
>> Stephen: WHERE DO YOU SEE
THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT
EXISTING NOW?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, THE THING
THAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THE
DOCUMENTARY IS THAT PEOPLE
LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHERE WE
HAVE BEEN FOR 20 OR 30 OR 40
YEARS AND HOW MUCH WE HAVE
DONE.
WE'VE DONE A LOT.
BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW THAT SAY
WOMEN CAN DO WHAT MEN CAN DO,
MOST FOLK WAS AGREE WITH
THAT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: BUT WE DON'T --
>> BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT
MEN CAN DO WHAT WOMEN CAN
DO.
>> Stephen: WE CANNOT HAVE
THE BABIES.
>> NO.
AND THEREFORE-- .
>> Stephen: WE CAN TO THE
HAVE THE BABIMENT I HAVE
TALKED TO A LOT OF DOCTORS.
>> THANSD'S WHY IT WOULD BE
GREAT IF MEN SPENT THAT MUCH
MORE THAN HALF THE TIME
CARING FOR THE CHILDREN
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE SPENT A
YEAR OR WHATEVER, YOU
KNOW-- .
>> Stephen: NINE MONTHS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPECIES
ARE YOU FROM BUT NINE MONTHS
WHERE I COME FROM.
>> OH, SO, NOBODY NURSED
YOU?
>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO.
I WAS-- I HAD FORMULA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I'M A CHILD OF
THE '60s.
>> THAT EXPLAINS.
>> Stephen: SO MEN SHOULD
SHARE HALF THE DUTY PLUS
NINE MONTHS THAT WOULD EVEN
THINGS OUT.
>> YEAH, A LOT OF THAT IS
LOGIC.
LODGEA LODGE SICK IN THE EYE
OF THE LODGICIAN BUT IT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT, THAT KIDS
GROW UP KNOWING THAT MEN CAN
BE AS LOVING AND NURTURING
AS WOMEN CAN.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT THE
ROLE OF THE FATHER WAS TO
TAKE HIS EMOTION AND STUFF
IT DOWN AS MUCH AS CAN SO IT
COMES OUT INAPPROPRIATELY AT
THANKSGIVING DINNER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
IS A REVOLUTION AND NOT A
REFORM.
>> GLORIA STEINHAM IS THE
MOST VISIBLE SYMBOL OF THE
WOMEN'S MOVEMENT.
>> YOU UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT
A ROLE EXCHANGE.
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO TO
MEN WHAT MEN HAVE DONE TO
US.
WE'RE TRYING TO HUMANIZE
BOTH ROLES.
>> EVERY GENERATION HAS ITS
OWN NAME.
>> MORE THAN A THIRD OF THIS
IS WOMEN UNDER 25 YEARS OLD.
>> PEOPLE WHO EMPOWER OTHER
PEOPLE.
>> SUSAN B. ANTHONY SAID OUR
JOB IS NOT TO MAKE YOUNG
WOMEN GRATE, IT'S TO MAKE
THEM UNGRATEFUL SO THEY KEEP
GOING.
WE'RE TO THE GOING TO STOP.
>> Stephen: IF THERE WAS ONE
THING THAT YOU COULD TELL TO
YOUNGER WOMEN TODAY WHO IT
NOT EXPERIENCE THE FEMINIST
MOVEMENT OF THE '60s AND THE
'70s, ONE EXAM PEV-- EXAMPLE
OF WHAT HAPPENED THEN THAT
DOESN'T HAPPEN ANY MORE THAT
CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE
FEMINIST MOVEMENT, WHAT
WOULD IT BE, WHAT WOULD YOU
SHOCK THEM WITH.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
IN THE MOVIE THAT WILL YOU
SEE.
>> Stephen: WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE
RIGHT NOW.
>> BUT THERE WERE
RESTAURANTS IN WHICH WOMEN
COULD NOT BE SEATED OR COULD
NOT GO AT LUNCHTIME.
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED WE LOST
MOST OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS,
OUR NAMES, OUR CREDIT
RATINGS, OUR LEGAL DOMICILE
AND BASICALLY WE THOUGHT
THAT OUR POSITION WAS DUE TO
NATURE OR YOU KNOW, FRAUD OR
GOD.
I DON'T KNOW-- FREUD.
>> Stephen: -- ENVY, NOTHING
TO BE ENVIOUS BY THE WAY.
IT'S REALLY A BURDEN.
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY-- IT
IS.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I HAVE HEARD YOU
SAY THAT YOU WERE
UNCOMFORTABLE BEING
PERCEIVED OF AS PRETTY, LIKE
THE PRETTY FEMINIST, WHY?
>> WELL, IT HAS TO DO WITH
BEING IDENTIFIED BY YOUR
OUTSIDES NOT YOUR INSIDES.
SO WOMEN WHO WERE PRETTY,
PEOPLE SAID OH THEY JUST
SUCCEEDED BECAUSE THEY WERE
PRETTY.
WOMEN WHO WERE NOT PRETTY
WHATEVER THAT MEANS, THEY
SAID OH, SHE IS SUCCEEDING
BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T GET A
MAN SO WE ALL BASICALLY HAD
THE SAME PROBLEM OF BEING
IDENTIFIED BY OUR OUTSIDES
INSTEAD OF OUR HEARTS AND
MINDS AND SO ON.
>> Stephen: BUT THE FACT
IS --
>> THAT STILL GOES ON.
>> Stephen: BUT THE FACT IS
YOU'RE PRETTY.
>> WELL, YOU'RE PRETTY TOO.
>> Stephen: I'VE BEEN
WAITING THE WHOM INTERVIEW
FOR THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO
WAIT SIX MINUTES.
GLORIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: GLORIA STEINHAM.
THE DOCUMENTARY, GLORIA, IN
HER OWN WORDS PREMIERS
MONDAY NIGHT ON HBO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
