>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN
A NEW BOOK ABOUT DOG
BEHAVIOR.
STAY, AUDIENCE, STAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME
JOHN BRADSHAW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, MR. BRADSHAW.
GOOD TO MEET YOU.
NOW SIR, YOU ARE THE
FOUNDATION DIRECTOR OF
ANTHRO ZOOLOGY INSTITUTE AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL
AND YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED
DOG SCENTS, HOW THE NEW
SCIENCE OF DOG BEHAVIOR CAN
MAKE YOU A BETTER FRIEND TO
YOUR PET-- YOUR PET.
WHAT IS THE NEW SCIENCE OF
DOG BEHAVIOR K IS THERE ANY
SCIENCE TO IT?
BECAUSE IN MY OPINION IT'S,
YOU KNOW F THE DOG IS
MISBEHALF-- MISBEHAVING IT
IS BECAUSE IT IS A BAD DOG.
2357BD HE IS NOT T BECAUSE
HE IS THE BEST DOG IN THE
WORLD, YES, HE IS.
THAT'S SCIENCE.
>> YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD
DESCRIPTION OF THE DOG.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> BUT DOES THE DOG HAVE THE
SAME IDEAS AS YOU HAVE.
>> Stephen: WELL.
>> DOES THE DOG KNOW HE'S
BAD.
>> Stephen: YEAH, I HAVE
TAUGHT MY DOG GOOD --
>> THAT'S A GOOD TRICK.
>> Stephen: SO HOW ARE WE,
HOW ARE WE GOOD FRIENDS TO
OUR DOG AND HOW ARE WE NOT
GOOD FRIENDS TO OUR DOG AND
HAS THAT CHANGED OVER THE
YEARS.
>> I THINK THE WAY WE THINK
OF OURSELVES AS BEING
FRIENDS TO OUR DOGS, ARE NOT
FRIENDS HAS CHANGED.
THAT IS WHAT THE NEW SCIENCE
IS ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT REALLY LOOK AT
THE DOG WITH FRESH EYES.
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE
DOG REALLY WANTS TO BE WITH
US.
IS NOT-- .
>> Stephen: MAN'S BEST
FRIEND.
>> IS NOT A WOLF DISGUISED
AS MAN'S BEST FRIEND.
HE IS ACTUALLY MAN'S BEST
FRIEND.
THAT IS THE NEW SCIENCE.
>> Stephen: SO THERE IS
NO-- NO WOLF IN THERE?
>> WELL THERE IS WOLF, THERE
IS WOLF.
AND THE DNA SAYS WOLF.
THAT IS UNDENIABLE BUT DO
MEST CASE-- .
>> Stephen: YOU JUST DENIED
IT.
>> I DIDN'T.
>> Stephen: YEAH, YOU SAID
HE'S NOT A WOLF.
>> HE'S NOT IN WOLF IN TERMS
OF HOW HE REGARDS THE WORLD.
DNA DOES NOT TELL YOU HOW TO
LOOK AT THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: YOU GIVE ME A
SENSE THAT IN THE BOOK YOU
GIVE A SENSE THAT WE'RE
MAYBE NOT TREATING OUR DOGS
WELL, THAT WE'RE ASKING TOO
MUCH OF THEM.
>> WE ARE.
WE ARE ASKING THEM, FOR
EXAMPLE, TO STAY AT HOME AND
BE GOOD WHILE WE'RE OUT AT
WORK.
AND THAT'S-- .
>> Stephen: STAY OFF THE
COUCH.
>> THAT'S IT.
DON'T CHEW THE TV REMOTES.
DO NOT TRY AND MAKE A HOLE
IN THE DRYWALL.
AND DOGS FIND THAT
REALLY-- THEY ARE UP SET
THAT IS WHY THEY DO THAT.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE THEY SO
UP SET.
>> WE MADE THEM LOVE US.
THAT'S HOW WE DOMESTICATED 9
WOLF.
WE TOOK ALL THE WILDNESS OUT
OF THE WOLF AND WE TURNED
HIM INTO A DOG, AN ANIMAL
THAT REALLY WANTS TO GET
ALONG WITH PEOPLE.
SO-- .
>> Stephen: AND THEN WE'RE
NOT THERE FOR THEM.
>> AND THEN WE'RE NOT THERE
FOR THEM, PRECISELY.
>> Stephen: IS THAT NEW.
>> IT'S MODERN LIFESTYLES.
WE LEAVE OUR DOG AS LOAN
MORE THAN WE USED IT TO AND
EXPECT THEM TO BE GOOD
COMPANIONS WHEN WE ARE THERE
AND TO GET OVER IT WHEN
WE'RE NOT.
AND A LOT OF DOGS FIND THAT
QUITE DIFFICULT.
IF YOU GO 100 YEARS BACK,
MOST OF THE DOGS WERE
WORKING FOR THEIR LIVING.
THEY WOULD BE WITH THE
PERSON THEY WORK WITH PRETTY
MUCH 24/7.
>> Stephen: SO YOU SAY THAT
WE SORT OF RUINED DOGS WITH
OUR WESTERN LIFESTYLE IS IT
SORT OF SOCIALISM THAT WE
GIVE OUR DOGS TREATS BUT
DON'T ASK THEM TO WORK FOR
IT ANY MORE?
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS A
SOCIALIST ELEMENT.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE IT
TO ME.
>> I THINK THEY GIVE BACK
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN
BALANCE TO WHAT WE GIVE
THEM.
>> Stephen: THEY SAY THAT
DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS BECOME
LIKE EACH OTHER.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE?
>> NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF
THAT AT ALL.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
SO ARE WE JUST PROJECTING
WHEN WE DO THAT?
>> I THINK THERE'S A DANGER
IN PROJECTING TOO MUCH, OF
ASSUMING THAT DOGS ARE
LITTLE PEOPLE AND HAVE ALL
THE EMOTIONS THAT WE HAVE.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE MY DOG
GIPPER AND I HAVE THE EXACT
SAME OPINION ON RAISING THE
DEBT CEILING.
(LAUGHTER)
AND HE JUST PROJECTING HIS
FEELING ON ME OR DO I REALLY
FEEL THAT WAY?
>> IS YOUR DOG A FINANCIAL
ADVISOR, I'M NOT SURE.
>> Stephen: HE'S PRETTY
SHARP.
HE'S PRETTY SHARP.
SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO TREAT
THEM BETTER?
BECAUSE I LOVE MY DOG.
ED AND I WANT TO BE GOOD TO
MY DOG.
AND HOW I CAN DO THAT?
>> I THINK WOULD YOU TRAIN,
YOU HAVE TRAINED YOUR DOG TO
COME BACK WHEN YOU CALL HIM
AND YOU'VE TRAINED YOUR DOG
NOT TO POOP IN THE HOUSE AND
YOU TRAINED YOUR DOG TO SIT
WHEN YOU SAY.
NO.
>> Stephen: NONE OF THAT,
ACTUALLY.
>> YEAH, WELL, I GUESS MOST
PEOPLE WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD
HAVE DONE THAT.
BUT WHAT WE SAY NOW IS THERE
IS ANOTHER THING YOU NEED TO
TRAIN YOUR DOG TO DO AND
THAT'S HOW TO DEAL WITH YOU
NOT BEING THERE.
HOW TO COPE ON ITS OWN.
>> Stephen: XANAX.
>> NO, COME ON T WORKS, IT
WORKS, WELCOME TO THE 21st
CENTURY OF DOG OWNERSHIP.
>> IT WORKS, IT WORK
APPROXIMATES IN TERMS OF
CALMING THE DOG DOWN ON THE
OUTSIDE BUT DOES IT WORK
CALMING CAN THE DOG DOWN ON
THE INSIDE.
>> Stephen: HOW WOULD WE
EVER KNOW?
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: HE CAN'T TELL US,
HE CAN'T TELL US.
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT DOGS
ARE SAYING.
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE
BIT OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.
>> Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHO
ELSE SAID THAT?
>> SON OF SAM.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
JOHN BRADSHAW, THE BOOK IS
