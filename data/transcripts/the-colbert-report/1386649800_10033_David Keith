(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS-- THATIS HOW YOU END UP WITH A
SHARK IN ADDITIONO.
DR. KEITH WHAT YOU HAVE GOT.
>> I'M GOOD WITH MR. .
>> Stephen: MR. KEITH, OKAY,ALL RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BOOKHERE CALLED A CASE FOR
CLIMATE ENGINEERING.
HOW WILL WE SAVE THE PLANET.
BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE, ALLTHE CHICKEN LITTLES OUT
THERE ARE SAYING THE PLANETIS WARMING UP.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT DOW.
>> I TOTALLY BELIEVE IT.
IT IS WARMING UP AND I HAVEBEEN THINKING ABOUT IT ALONG
WITHER O PEOPLE WAYS TO STOPIT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, DOESINVOLVE ME USING ONE OF
THOSE LITTLE PIG TAILLIGHTBULBS?
>> THAT IS A USEFUL THING TODO.
AND I HAVE THOSE IN MYHOUSE.
AND I'M THINKING ABOUTSOMETHING ELSE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, GOOD WHATIS THE OTHER THING BECAUSE I
WOULD LIKE TO DO ANYTHINGOTHER THAN THAT.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DO WEDO?
>> THE OTHER THING ISHORRIFYING.
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SPRAYSULFURIC ACID IN THE
ATMOSPHERE 20 KILOMETERSOVER OUR HEAD AND USE THAT
TO STOP THE PLANET WARMINGUP.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN SPRAYSOMETHING INTO THE
ATMOSPHERE TO CHANGE-- OKAY.
>> SPRAY POLLUTION INTO THEATMOSPHERE TO STOP IT
WARMING.
>> Stephen: SO IN THE ENDPOLLUTION SAVES THEM ALL.
WE OWE POLLUTION, WE OWEACID RAIN AN APOLOGY IS WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING.
>> IT WOULD BE A TOTALLYIMPERFECT TECHNICAL FIX T
WOULD HAVE RISKS T WOULDN'TGET US OUT OF THE LONG RUN
NEED TO STOP POLLUTING BUTIT MIGHT ACTUALLY SAVE
PEOPLE AND BE USEFUL.
>> Stephen: OKAY, AGAIN, IINTERRUPTED YOU SLIGHTLY
THERE.
HOW DOES IT WORK, YOU HOWMANY PLANES ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE, HOW DO YOU DOTHIS.
>> LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TOSTOP IT WARMING IN 2020.
YOU START WITH A FLEET OFJUST 2 OR 3 KIND OF MODIFIED
BUSINESS JETS.
>> Stephen: LIKE A G-6.
>> THAT'S IT.
>> Stephen: LIKE A G6.
>> AND YOU PUT SAY 20,000TONS OF SULFURIC ACID NOT
STRATOSPHERE EVERY YEAR ANDEACH YEAR YOU HAVE TO PUT A
LITTLE MORE AND IN THE LONGRUN THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT CUTTINGEMISSIONS.
WE WILL NEED TO REIGN IT.
>> Stephen: NO, WE'LL GET TOIT EVENTUALLY.
IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE SHROUDINGTHE EARTH IN SULFURIC ACID.
>> SO PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIEDABOUT TALKING ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE THEY'RE SKAERED THATIT WILL PREVENT US CUTTING
EMISSIONS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, AND ALSOTHAT IT IS SULFURIC ACID.
>> IT IS.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANYPOSSIBLE WAY THIS COULD COME
BACK TO BITE US IN THE ASS?
PLAN CONNECT THE EARTH INNSULFURIC ACID BECAUSE I'M
ALL FOR IT.
THIS IS THE ALL CHOCOLATEDINNER.
I STILL GET TO HAVE THE CO2AND I JUST HAVE TO SPRAY
SULFURIC ACID, RIGHT.
ALL OVER THE EARTH.
>> RIGHT QUESTION BUT WE PUT50 MILLION TONS OF SULFURIC
ACID.
THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE AYEAR WORLDWIDE, IT KILLS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S TERRIBLE.
>> BUT IT WILL BE BETTER IFWE PUT MORE IN.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1% OFTHAT.
A TINY FRACTION OF THAT.
>> WE SHOULD REDUCE IT.
>> ONLY 1% MORE WE'RE JUSTKILLING 10,000 MORE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN DO MATH,OKAY.
>> BUT THAT'S-- SO KILLINGPEOPLE IS NOT THE OBJECTIVE
HERE.
>> Stephen: KILLING PEOPLEIS NOT THE OBJECTIVE.
I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR.
>> ACTUALLY, SLOWING CLIMATECHANGE, ACTUALLY STOPPING
CLIMATE CHANGE IN A WAY THATCOULD HELP PEOPLE THIS
GENERATION, PEOPLE LIVINGNOW, IN A WAY THERE'S NO
OTHER EASY ALTERNATIVE.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU JUST DOIT FOR PART OF THE PLANET.
>> PRETTY OF THE WHOLEPLANET.
>> Stephen: COULD YOU, JUSTSAY LIKE MAKE THINGS BETTER
FOR THE UNITED STATES?
>> VERY HARD TO DO.
IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS-- BUTTHE BIG FEAR IS THAT ONE
COUNTRY WILL WANT IT ONE WAYAND ONE THE OTHER, LIKE TWO
FRAT BOYS ARGUE OVER THETHERMOSTAT AND IN MANY WAYS
THE BIGGEST FEAR HERE, WEHAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ACTUALLY
AGREE ABOUT HOW TO CONTROLTHE PLANET'S THERMOSTAT.
>> Stephen: LET'S SAY THEUNITED STATES AND CHINA SAY
YEAH, LET'S DO IT BUT RUSSIAAND INDIA SAY YEAH, NOT DO
IT.
>> THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFFI WAKE UP SWEATING ABOUT.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: IT'S YOURGODDAMN IDEA.
>> IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT TOBE AN OLD IDEA.
>> A SIGN OF THE COMMUNITYMOSTLY DECIDED NOT TO TALK
ABOUT IT FOR FEAR PEOPLEWOULD LOSE THE THREAT OF
CUTTING EMISSIONS.
>> WHAT WHAT HAPPEN TO ITSSULFURIC ACID AFTER IT IS
SPRAYED.
DOES IT JUST STAY UP THERE.
>> NO, IT RAINS DOWN BUT ASI SAID, IT RAINS DOWN.
IT'S A TINY EDITION OF WHATWE'RE ALREADY DOING.
>> HAVE YOU GOTTEN SOMEGRIEF FOR SUGGESTIONING
THIS?
>> SURE THIS IS LIKE WRITINGA BOOK ABOUT THE CASE FOR
LEPROSY.
>> Stephen: DOW HAVE ONE.
>> YEAH, IT'S A GREAT WEIGHTLOSS PLAN.
BUT ALSO MANY PEOPLE AREHAPPY THAT PEOPLE ARE
FINALLY TALKING ABOUT THISBECAUSE WHILE IT IS UGLY T
DOES APPEAR THAT IT REALLYCOULD DO SOME GOOD.
>> Stephen: COULD ANINDIVIDUAL START THIS?
>> IN PRACTICE ONLY ACOUNTRY.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT A MANIN LIKE A HOLLOWED OUT
VOLCANO WITH HENCHMEN WHOOCCASIONALLY SHAKE THEIR
FIST AT THE SKY AND SAYSTHEY SAID I WAS A FOOL AT
HARVARD.
WHO'S THE FOOL NOW!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> IT'S A NATURAL WORRY BUT
I THINK IN THE END, NO.
THIS WOULD BE DONE BY MAJORCOUNTRIES BUT THE PROBLEM IS
HOW COUNTRIES AGREE ABOUTWHERE TO SET THE THERMOSTAT.
WHO DECIDES.
AND MY BIGGEST REASON FORWRITING THE BOCK AND FOR
TALKING ABOUT IT IS MY VIEWTHAT WE WON'T MAKE GOOD
DECISIONS IN IGNORANCE.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO HAVETHE DISCUSSION NOW SO WHEN
IT BECOMES OUR LAST HOPE,PEOPLE CAN SAY HEY, WE
TALKED ABOUT THIS, REMEMBER.
WE SAID WE GET TO DO IT.
>> ED WORST WAY TO MAKEDECISIONS ABOUT THIS WOULD
BE IF WE ALL AGREE THAT WEWON'T TALK ABOUT IT IN
POLITE SOCIETY, SUPPRESS ITWHICH IS WHAT HAS BEEN
HAPPENING.
AND THEN IN 2030 SUDDENLYTHE CRISIS WE MAKE FAST
DECISIONS.
>> Stephen: MAYBE IT'SHAPPENING ALREADY.
DOW EVER LOOK AT THOSEPLANES UP THERE, THEY HAVE
CONTRAILS BEHIND THEM.
MAYBE ALL THOSE PLANES WITHTHE CRON TRAILS ARE SPRAYING
CHEMICAL APPROXIMATES INTOTHE ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW AND
UNCLE SAM SAM ISN'T TELLINGUS.
>> SEEMS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY.
>> Stephen: THE FACT THATTHE UNITED STATES ISN'T
TELLING SOMETHING TO ITSCITIZENS SEEMS EXTREMLY
UNLIKELY.
I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE YOURIDEA ALREADY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DAVID KEITH, A CASE FORCLIMATE ENGINEERING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
