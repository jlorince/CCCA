[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
NATION, BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER
TONIGHT, I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE
LATEST, THE VERY LATEST ON THE
KNOCK DOWN DRAG OUT FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN ME AND JIMMY FALLON.
[LAUGHTER]
AFTER THE AUCTION OF MY PORTRAIT
RAISED $26,000 FOR ARTS
EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS
THROUGH DONORSCHOOSE.ORG I MADE
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
I AM HAPPY AND THRILLED TO
REPORT THAT MY BEST FRIEND FOR
SIX MONTHS, JIMMY FALLON, WILL
BE MATCHING THAT $26,000 TO
DONORSCHOOSE.ORG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHICH THEN LED MY BFF FOR SIX
MONTHS JIMMY TO MAKE THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> HERE IS THE THING:  I NEVER
SAID THAT.
IF WE CAN RAISE $26,000 BY THIS
FRIDAY, I'LL PROMISE THAT MY BFF
FOR SIX MONTHS, STEPHEN COLBERT
WILL COME ON THIS SHOW AND SING
FRIDAY WITH THE ROOTS.
>> Stephen: HERE IS THE THING:
I NEVER SAID THAT.
I'M SHOCKED.
I'M SHOCKED.
IT IS ONE THING FOR ME TO PLEDGE
HUGE SUMS OF HIS MONEY WITHOUT
ASKING BUT HIM TELLING PEOPLE
THAT I PROMISED TO SING WHEN I
DIDN'T?
WHAT DOES HE THINK I AM?
MADE OF MUSIC?
I'M A MAN OF JIMMY'S WORD SO I
AGREED TO SING THIS SONG IF THEY
RAISE $26,000 BY FRIDAY.
WHEN I WATCHED JIMMY LAST NIGHT,
THINGS WERE LOOKING GOOD.
>> AS OF TONIGHT I'M HAPPY TO
SAY WE'RE AT $10,326.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, PEOPLE!
>> Stephen: WAIT, WAIT, DID HE
SAY ALMOST THERE?
SORRY, JIMMY, LESS THAN HALFWAY
IS NOT ALMOST THERE.
I LEARNED THAT WHEN I TRIED TO
EXPLAIN TO THE MANAGER OF MY GYM
THAT MY SHORTS ALMOST COVERED MY
BUTT.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW JUST TO MAKE EXTRA SURE THIS
FUND-RAISING WOULD NEVER HAPPEN,
I CALLED YOU ON THE COLBERT
NATION TO STAY AWAY FROM
DONORSCHOOSE.ORG/FALLONCHOOSE
PROJECT.
I HAVE TO SAY YOU REALLY
DISAPPOINTED ME BECAUSE AFTER
ONLY THREE HOURS AFTER
YESTERDAY'S SHOW JIMMY AND I'S
DONORS CHOOSE PAGE HAD RAISED
$26,043.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW.
I AM JUST AS OUTRAGE AS YOU ARE.
IT'S TO NOT YOUR FAULT.
THOSE WHO DIDN'T DONATE, YOU ARE
THE TRUE HEROS.
NOW I HAVE TO SING THIS FRIDAY
THING ON JIMMY'S SHOW.
REMIND ME WHAT THE SONG IS
AGAIN.
♪ FRIDAY, FRIDAY ♪
THAT'S ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

THANK YOU.
DAMMIT.
[LAUGHTER]
I'VE GOT TO PRACTICE IF I'M
GOING TO PULL THIS THING OFF.
