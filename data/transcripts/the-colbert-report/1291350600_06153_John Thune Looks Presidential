>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
FOLKS, I JUST WANT TO SAY TO ANY
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT ARE OUT
THERE WATCHING, STUDY FOR
S.A.T.s.
( LAUGHTER )
AND ONLY DOPES DO DOPE.
SOUND WISDOM.
ANYWAY, NATION, NATION, IT'S NO
SEEK RHETT, I LOVE GAMBLING.
THE LIGHT, THE SLOTS, THE
EXCITEMENT.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I'VE GOT
$10,000 RIDING ON WHETHER THE
LAST WORD OF THIS SENTENCE WILL
BE BANANA.
DAMMIT.
MY MONEY WAS ON ORANGE.
WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL MY WIFE?
WELL, THERE'S NO GREATER GAMBLE
THAN YOUR ELECTED
REPRESENTATIVES.
I WAS SO THRILLED TO LEARN THAT
EUROPEAN GAMBLING WEB SITES LIKE
IN TRADE AND BET FAIR ARE
ALREADY LAYING ODDS ON WHO THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE WILL BE FOR
2012.
LEADING THE PACK ARE THE OBVIOUS
CHOICES, MITT ROMNEY AND SARAH
PALIN, BUT THE THIRD-PLACE
CONTENDER IS SOUTH DAKOTA
SENATOR JOHN THUNE, YEAH, THAT
JOHN THUNE, THE ONE YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD OF.
HE'S SO KNOWN HE DOESN'T EVEN
COME UP IN GAMES OF NAME THAT
THUNE.
NOW, EVEN THOUGH, FOLKS, HE'S
POLLING AT 2% FROM REPUBLICAN
VOTERS, THE SMART MONEY KNOWS
THAT THUNE HAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUALITY -- HE LOOKS
LIKE A PRESIDENT.
AS ONE POLITICAL ANALYST PUT IT,
SNAP JUDGMENTS MATTER.
LOOKING PRESIDENTIAL IS
IMPORTANT.
EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR
HALEY BARBOUR IS CURRENTLY
RANKED ONLY NINTH ON IN TRADE'S
LIST FOR PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT FIRST ON THEIR LIST FOR
RACIST SHERIFF/BARBECUE
CHAMPION.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, I BET... THAT GUY KNOWS HOW
TO TURN A PIG.
NOW, PICKING A CANDIDATE BASED
ON LOOKS IS A GREAT TACT FOR THE
REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY SINCE
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BARACK
OBAMA THAT DOESN'T QUITE MATCH
OUR TRADITIONAL IMAGE OF
PRESIDENTS.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT.
IT'S SOMETHING, IT'S SOMETHING
IN THIS AREA.
FIGURE IT OUT.
ANYWAY, THE G.O.P. SHOULD
DEFINITELY LOOK FOR MORE
CANDIDATES WHO HAVE PRESIDENT
SEEMINGNESS, LIKE SENATOR GUY
WHO CAME WITH THE PICTURE FRAME.
GOVERNOR GUY ON THE JUST FOR MEN
BOX AND CONGRESSMAN VIAGRA WEB
SITE MODEL.
WHAT HE LAX IN POLITICAL
EXPERIENCE HE MORE THAN MAKES UP
FOR IN STAMINA.
NOW, THINGS THAT LOOK RIGHT ARE
ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE.
SO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS JOHN
THUNE.
OKAY.
HE LOOKS LIKE OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT, ORMAN IN A NASAL
DECONGESTANT AD.
EITHER WAY, KE
