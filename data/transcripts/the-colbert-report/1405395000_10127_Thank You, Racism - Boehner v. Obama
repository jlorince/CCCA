AND NATION IF THERE IS ONETHING I HAVE ALWAYS SAID
ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT BARACKOBAMA, IS THAT HE'S AN
INEFFECTUAL WEAKLING IN MOMJEANS.
BUT IF THERE'S A SECONDTHING I'VE SAID IT'S THAT
HE'S AN IMPERIAL TYRANT WITHAN IRON FIST IN MOM JEANS.
(LAUGHTER)AND FACING THE LAST TWO
YEARS OF HIS LIFE LONG RULE,OBAMA HAS SWORN TO USE
EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO RAM HISNEFARIOUS AGENDA DOWN
AMERICA'S GULLET.
>> WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TOBE WAITING FOR LEGISLATION
IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THATWE'RE PROVIDING AMERICANS
THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEYNEED.
I'VE GOT A PEN AND I'VE GOTA PHONE.
>> Stephen: HE'S GOT A PENAND A PHONE.
HE'S NOT ONLY ISSUINGEXECUTIVE ORDERS, HE'S
STEALING OFFICE SUPPLIES.
(LAUGHTER)SOMEBODY BETTER GLUE DOWN
THE STAPLER IN THE OVALOFFICE, THEN STAPLE DOWN THE
GLUE GUN.
NOW FORTUNATELY SPEAKER OF THEHOUSE JOHN BOEHNER IS
PUTTING AN END TO THISOVERREACH.
>> HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNBOEHNER SAYS HE IS FILING A
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION ON BEHALF OF
CONGRESS.
HE'S ACCUSING THEPRESIDENT OF GOING AROUND
THE LAW BY USING EXECUTIVEORDERS.
>> Stephen: THANK GODSOMEONE IS FINALLY SUING
BARACK OBAMA.
THOUGH I ALWAYS THOUGHT ITWOULD BE WHOEVER LIVED AT
1601 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.
I MEAN THOSE HELICOPTERSHAVE GOT TO BE-- SOME KIND
OF NOISE VIOLATION.
(LAUGHTER)AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT
BOEHNER IS SUING OBAMA OVER,UNLESS YOU GUESSED
OBAMACARE.
(LAUGHTER)JIM?
>> BOEHNER SAYS PRESIDENTOBAMA OVERSTEPPED HIS
AUTHORITY WHEN HE DELAYEDTHE EMPLOYER MANDATE PORTION
OF OBAMACARE WITHOUT FIRSTSEEKING CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL.
>> WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUTHERE ARE PLACES WHERE THE
PRESIDENT IS BASICALLYREWRITING LAW TO MAKE IT FIT
HIS OWN NEEDS.
>> Stephen: YES.
AND CONGRESS CANNOT SIT IDLYBY WHILE THE PRESIDENT
REWRITES THEIR LAWS.
THEY HAVE TO SIT IDLY BYWHILE THEY NOT WRITE LAWS.
AND OBAMA'S OVERUSE OFEXECUTIVE ORDERS IS
UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERNAMERICAN HISTORY IN THAT HE
HAS ISSUED FEWER THAN ANYPRESIDENT SINCE FDR.
AND DON'T TELL ME THAT EVERYPRESIDENT ISSUED EXECUTIVE
ORDERS BECAUSEWILLIAM HENRY
HARRISON DID NOT SIGN ASINGLE EXECUTIVE ORDER.
INSTEAD, THIS GOOD MAN CHOSETO DIE OF PNEUMONIA 30 DAYS
INTO OFFICE.
THAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP.
NOW CONSERVATIVES LIKEMYSELF HAVE SUPPORTED A
UNITARY EXECUTIVE AND USE OFEXECUTIVE ORDERS IN THE
PAST.
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUTTHIS PRESIDENT THAT MAKES
THE WHOLE THING SEEM SHADY.
(LAUGHTER)SOMETHING-- I'M UPSET TOO.
SOMETHING, SOMETHING HESHARES WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL
ERIC HOLDER.
>> THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVELOF VEHEMENCE IT SEEMS THAT
IS DIRECTED AT THEPRESIDENT.
THERE'S A CERTAIN RACIALCOMPONENT TO THIS FOR SOME
PEOPLE, FOR SOME THERE'S ARACIAL ANIMUS.
>> Stephen: RACIAL ANIMUS.
HOLDER IS SAYING I FEELDIFFERENTLY ABOUT EXECUTIVE
ORDERS BECAUSE OBAMA ISBLACK.
AND I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUEWITH ERIC HOLDER ON THIS ONE
BECAUSE HE MIGHT ACCUSE MEOF RACIAL ANIMUS.
THEN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK UPTHE WORD ANIMUS.
(LAUGHTER)I THINK IT MEANS BUTTHOLE.
(LAUGHTER)WELL-- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
WELL, HOLDER'S ACCUSATIONBRINGS ME TO ANOTHER EDITION
OF MY LONG AWARD-LOSINGSEGMENT, THANK YOU RACISM.
YOU SEE-- (APPLAUSE)
LAST WEEK ERIC HOLDER STOODBY HIS PREVIOUS STATEMENT
THAT AMERICANS AREESSENTIALLY A NATION OF COWARDS
WHEN IT COMES TOTALKING ABOUT RACE.
BUT HOLDER COULD NOT BEFURTHER FROM THE LET'S SAY
TRUTH.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE I SEE ONLY NOW THAT
EXECUTIVE ORDERS HAVE ALWAYSBEEN WRONG.
BUT WITHOUT MY APPARENTDISTRUST OF BLACK PEOPLE I
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THECOURAGE TO SUDDENLY BE MOVED
TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTIONFROM THE OVERREACH I DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT BEFORE.
NOW, NOW I AM STANDING UPFOR AMERICA OR AGAINST OBAMA,
WHATEVER, SAME DIFF.
NOW I KNOW I'VE SAID SOMETERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT RACISM
IN THE PAST, FOLKS.
I GUESS-- I GUESS IPREJUDGED RACISM WITHOUT
REALLY KNOWING IT.
(LAUGHTER)AND FOR THAT I'M SORRY,
