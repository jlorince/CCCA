[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NATIONALLY
SYNDICATED SEX ADVICE COLUMNIST,
WHO SAYS MONOGAMY IS OUT-DATED.
YOU KNOW WHAT NEVER GOES OUT OF
STYLE?
HELL.
PLEASE WELCOME DAN SAVAGE!
LET'S GO, TAD.
LET'S GO!
COME ON!
LET'S GO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOOH!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DAN THIS, IS TAD, HE IS MY
HETEROSEXUALITY ACCOUNTABILITY
BUDDY.
>> LOOVES FAMILIAR.
>> Stephen: GO PACKERS!
YOU ARE THE COUNTRY'S LEADING
SEX ADVICE COLUMNIST.
YOU ARE AN AUTHOR.
YOU STARTED THE IT GETS BETTER
PROJECT THIS FALL.
IN THE TPHORBGTS MAGAZINE
THERE'S A RECENT PIECE ABOUT
YOU.
IN IT YOU SAY A SUCCESSFUL
MARRIAGE, ONE OF KEYS IS
ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT OF
MONOGAMY.
>> NOT EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID WE
SHOULDN'T BE --
>> YOU SID IT SHOULDN'T BE THE
OPEN CHARACTERISTIC OF A
MARRIAGE.
>> Stephen: IF YOU DON'T MAKE
THAT.
DID YOU VOW TO BE MON NOTHING
MUSS WITH YOUR HUSBAND?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A A
MARRIAGE IT'S A JOINT CHECKING
ACCOUNT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> ARE THE CLINTONS MARRIED?
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
>> ARE THE VITTER'S MARRIED?
EXSENATOR ENSIGN DO -- IS HE
MARRIED?
WE ONLY HERE MONOGAMY THAT IS A
PART OF MARRIAGE.
WE NEVER HEAR --
>> Stephen: WE DO.
YOU ARE SAYING WE SHOULDN'T PUT
SO MUCH WEIGHT ON IT?
>> WE'RE BAD ATE IT.
LOOK AT THE CLINTON, LOOK AT THE
VITTER'S, THE LIMBAUGH'S --
>> Stephen: I KNOW I SHOULD DO
CRUNCHES.
>> BUT YOUR MARRIAGE DOESN'T
COLLAPSE.
>> Stephen: MY HEART FAILS.
MARRIAGE IS AN EXERCISE.
YOU HAVE TO WORK AT IT.
WHAT IS HEAVEN FOR IF YOU DON'T
SET THESE GOAL?
>> IF PEOPLE MAKE A MONOGAMOUS
COMMITMENT THEY SHOULD TRY TO
HONOR IT.
MANY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE
IN MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIPS AND
THOSE WHO MADE THE COMMITMENT
WILL FALL SHORT AND THEN WHAT?
SHOULD IT BE A RELATIONSHIP END
ENDING EVENT.
OR SHOULD IT BE SOMETHING THAT
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET PAST.
THE MARRIAGE SHOULD BE EXPECTED
TO SURVIVE.
>> Stephen: THAT IS NOT WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING.
YOU ARE BACK PEDALING?
>> I'M NOT.
>> Stephen: HIGH FIVE, BUDDY.
YOU WERE ACTUALLY SAYING THAT
PLAYING AROUND OUTSIDE A
RELATIONSHIP CAN BE GOOD.
>> IT CAN SAVE A MARRIAGE AT
TIMES.
>> Stephen: FOOLING AROUND CAN
SAVE A MARRIAGE.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR
YEARS THAT GAY PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO DESTROY THE INSTITUTION OF
MARRIAGE AND NOW THAT YOU ARE
MARRIED YOU ARE DESTROYING IT
FROM THE INSIDE.
>> GAY PEOPLE ARE FORCING
STRAIGHT FOAM ADMIT THEY
REDEFINED MARRIAGE DECADES AGO.
IT WAS A PROPERTY TRANSACTION
WHERE A MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF
ANOTHER MAN'S PROPERTY, DAUGHTER
AND THEN WIFE.
>> Stephen: I STILL BELIEVE IN
A DOWRY.
I GOT MANY CATTLE WHEN I GOT
MARRIED.
>> IT'S A LEGAL UNION OF TWO
EQUALS AND THEY GET TO DEFINE
IT.
IT COULD BE MONOGAMOU S,
RELIGIOUS OR NOT.
IT'S UP TO THAT COUPLE.
THAT INSTITUTION.
THERE'S NO LOGICAL CASE THAT CAN
BE MADE TO EXCLUDE GAY PEOPLES
FROM AN INTUITION THAT DOESN'T
INCLUDE STRAIGHT COUPLES
MONOGAMOUS OR NOT.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU HAD
AFFAIRS?
>> IT DEPENDS IS IT ADULTERY IF
I'M COMMITTING IT AT ONE END OF
THE GUY AND HE IS COMMITTING IT
AT THE OTHER END OF THE SAME --
SAME GUY?
>> TAILGATING.
>> Stephen: GO PACKERS.
>> CHAIN SAWS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YOU SAY -- YOU SAY
THAT IN SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS ONE
OF REASONS WHY MONOGAMY ISN'T
NECESSARY --
>> I DON'T SAY IT'S NOT
NECESSARY.
IT'S NECESSARY IF YOU REQUIRE
IT.
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THOSE
COMMITMENTS.
YOU JUMBLED UP MY POINT.
IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO A COUPLE
AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A
MONOGAMOUS COMMITMENT, I BELIEVE
IT WORKS FOR THEM STAOEFRBLGTS
WHAT IF ONLY ONE OF THEM WANTS
THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP?
>> THAT PERSON SHOULDN'T MAKE
THAT COMMITMENT AND FIND
SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T WANT THAT
COMMITMENT AND MARRY THAT
PERSON.
>> Stephen: THAT ARGUMENT
AMIES TO GAY PEOPLE BEAUTIFULLY
I'M SURE.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M MARRIED TO A WOMAN.
I'M NOT MARRIED TO A GUY.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH
SOMEONE ELSE, I TOTALLY
UNDERSTAND IF WE'RE MARRIED.
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I'M
NOT SATISFYING YOU BUT --
>> BUT YOUR WIFE IS MARRIED TO A
MAN AND STRAIGHT WOMEN HAVE TO
BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT MEN ARE
AND WHAT MEN ARE LIKE.
I.
>> People: WHO ARE SEXUALLY
SATISFIED WHO AREN'T BOILING ARE
LIKELY TO BE CONTENT AND STAY
MARRIED.
THERE'S SEXLESS MARRIAGES OUT.
THERE WE TELL TELL PEOPLE YOU
SHOULD DIVORCE.
I'M AGAINST DIVORCE.
MY POSITION IS CONSERVATIVE AND
TRADITIONAL.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE
CONSERVATIVE AT WHICH END OF THE
GUY?
