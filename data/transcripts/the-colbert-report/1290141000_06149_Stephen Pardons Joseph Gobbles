WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
MY GOODNESS.
MY GOODNESS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO
"THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
PLEASE.
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS STAFF
SERGEANT SAL GIUNTA.
HE'S NOT HERE TO PUSH A MOVIE.
HE'S NOT HERE TO PUSH A BOOK.
HE JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE FIRST
LIVING RECIPIENT OF THE MEDAL OF
HONOR SINCE THE VIETNAM WAR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND IT IS MY HONOR TO HAVE HIM
HERE TONIGHT, AND JUST THIS ONCE
I WILL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU
APPLAUD FOR HIM MORE THAN ME.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT JUST THIS ONCE.
NATION, THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW
BEFORE THANKSGIVING.
MAGICAL TIME OF YEAR WHEN
FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
GATHERED TOGETHER TO RAISE
AMERICA'S OBESITY STATISTICS.
PERSONALLY I LOVE THANKSGIVING
TRADITIONS, WATCHING FOOTBALL,
MAKING PUMPKIN PIE AND SAYING
THE MAGIC PHRASE THAT SENDS YOUR
AUNT STORMING OUT OF THE DINING
ROOM TO SIT IN HER CAR.
THIS YEAR THE MAGIC PHRASE IS:
THERE'S SUCH A THING AS TOO MUCH
WINE.
TRY IT.
IT WILL WORK.
NOW, ONE OF THE RITUALS I
ESPECIALLY ENJOY IS THE ANNUAL
PRESIDENTIAL TURKEY PARDON,
WHERE THE PRESIDENT GRANTS A
STAY OF EXECUTION TO ONE SPECIAL
BIRD.
I ASSUME IT'S TO THE TURKEY WHO
DONATED THE MOST TO HIS
CAMPAIGN.
WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING
TO PARDON HIS TURKEY NEXT WEEK,
AND I WILL NOT BE
OUTMERCIFULLED.
SO BRING HIM OUT, BOYS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, "THE
COLBERT REPORT'S" 02010
THANKSGIVING TURKEY, JOSEF
GOBBLES.
( LAUGHTER )
IT IS NICE TO DARK "MEAT" YOU,
JOE.
THAT'S TURKEY HUMOR.
TONIGHT'S YOUR LUCKY NIGHT
BECAUSE BY THE POWER VESTED IN
ME BY BASIC CABLE, I HEREBY
GRANT TO YOU A FULL AND COMPLETE
PARDON FOR ALL YOUR CRIMES PAST,
PRESENT AND FUTURE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND SO OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY
HEART, MY FAMILY WILL INSTEAD
DEVOUR ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK, JOE, OR AS YOUR
PEOPLE
