(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I'M LIKE AN UMPIRECALLING BALLS AND STRIKES AND IF
YOU DISAGREE WITH ME I WILLSTRIKE YOUR BALLS.
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, ANYBODY THAT KNOWS ME
KNOWS I BELIEVE IN THE SECONDAMENDMENT.
I MEAN, IF IT'S NOT REAL THENWHO LEFT ME THOSE GUNS ON
CHRISTMAS MORNING?
(LAUGHTER)SADLY, THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE
DENIED THE JOY OF PACKING HEAT,BUT THE GOOD CORN PACKERS OF
IOWA ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUTIT.
I I IN IOWA, THE "DES MOINESREGISTER" IS REPORTING THAT
STATE ISSUES PERMITS TO CARRYFIREARMS IN PUBLIC TO PEOPLE WHO
ARE BLIND.
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR A GROUP CALLEDDISABILITY RIGHTS IOWA TOLD THE
NEWSPAPER THAT DENYING THE BLINDGUN PERMITS WOULD VIOLATE THE
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
>> Stephen: LOOK, THIS ISPLAIN AND SIMPLE.
IF YOU'RE AGAINST BLINDAMERICANS WIELDING DEADLY
WEAPONS IN PUBLIC THEN YOU HATETHE DISABLED.
YOU'RE A MONSTER.
I BET YOU'RE ALSO AGAINST BABYANIMALS AND STARVING CHILDREN
HAVING GUNS AS WELL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, FOLKS, SINCE I'M STEPHEN
COLBERT-- FRIEND TO THE BLIND--I AM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THEY ARE WHY I DO THIS RADIO
SHOW EVERY NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)I WANT TO GIVE A TIP OF THE HAT
TO IOWA.
IT'S HIGH TIME THE BLIND HADGUNS.
THEY WORK WAY BETTER FORNAVIGATING THE STREETS THAN
THOSE GUIDE CANES.
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WAVING A GUNAROUND, BELIEVE ME, A PATH WILL
CLEAR.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, FOLKS --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, I HEAR YOU.
YOU MIGHT ASK "STEPHEN, WHY CANTHE BLIND BE DENIED A DRIVER'S
LICENSE BUT NOT A GUN PERMIT?"WELL, GREG, THAT'S BECAUSE GUN
OWNERSHIP IS CONSIDERED ACONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WHILE
DRIVING IS CONSIDERED APRIVILEGE.
WHICH MEANS IF THE BLIND WANT TODRIVE, THEY SHOULD GATE TANK.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE, ACCORDING -- ACCORDING
TO ALTOONA BLIND MAN MICHAELBARBER, WHEN YOU SHOOT A GUN YOU
TAKE IT OUT AND POINT AND SHOOTAND I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
EYESIGHT IS NECESSARY.
(LAUGHTER)TRUE.
THOUGH HE DID GIVE THATINTERVIEW TO A POTTED FERN.
(LAUGHTER)AND, UNLIKE THE SKEPTICS OUT
THERE, I TRUST THE BLIND!
I'M SURE THEY'LL USE THEIR GUNSRESPONSIBLY AND GET THEMSELVES A
SHOOTING EYE DOG.
(LAUGHTER)TO BARK AT DANGER AND, OF
COURSE, A SPARE DOG FOR WHENTHEY SHOOT THE FIRST ONE.
(LAUGHTER)NEXT UP ON THE-DUBS, SUMMER IS
OVER AND LIKE MOST AMERICANS IHAD MY SHARE OF HOT DOGS AND
COLD BEER.
THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO ISSUE ATIP OF MY HAT TO BIGGER PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, DON'T MEAN GIANT CLOWN
PANTS, I MEAN (AUDIENCE CHANTING"STEPHEN")S THAT ARE ONE SIZED
LARGER THAN THE ONES I'M USED TOWEARING.
SEE, I JUST GRABBED THE FIRSTPAIR OF PANTS IN THE CLOSET THIS
MORNING AND THEY'RE BIGGER.
LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, I'MLOVING IT.
(LAUGHTER)THEY'RE ROOMY, BREEZY, NOTHING
IS SWEATING AND IT FEELS LIKE ILOST WEIGHT-- BUT I DIDN'T.
(LAUGHTER)YOU HEARD IT HEAR FIRST, FOLKS,
BIGGER PANTS, MAKING ADIFFERENCE.
FINALLY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGEFAN OF THE BODY'S EXHIBIT.
IT ANSWERS THE AGE-OLD QUESTION:"WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF BUFFALO
BILL HAD AN N.E.A. GRANT?"(LAUGHTER)
BUT, ACCORDING TO RECENTARTICLES, THE BODIES IN THESE
EXHIBITS MAY BE MURDERED FALUNGONG, PERHAPS EVEN THOSE KILLED
FOR THEIR ORGANS, WHICH IS WHYI'M GIVING A WAG OF THE FINGER
TO RECENT ARTICLES.
(LAUGHTER)WAY TO RUIN THE FUN, ARTICLES!
NOW THIS WHOLE EXHIBIT OFDISSECTED HUMAN CADAVERS SEEMS
KIND OF CREEPY.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, I REFUSE TO LET THE
BECAUSE SHACKLERS OUT THERE RUINMY DAUGHTER'S EIGHTH BIRTHDAY
PARTY.
WE'RE GOING, BRITTANY, DON'T YOUWORRY!
BESIDES, MUSEUM OFFICIALS ASSUREUS THE CORPSES CAME FROM
INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOSE TO DONATETHEIR BODIES TO MEDICAL SCIENCE.
YOU HEAR THIS THAT?
MEDICAL SCIENCE!
OR WHATEVER THIS IS.
THEY WEREN'T EXECUTED PRISONERS!
I MEAN, THIS MAN CLEARLY DIEDHAPPY.
LOOK AT THAT SMILE.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND I LIKE TO BELIEVE HE DONATEDHIS BODY OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.
I'M SURE THERE ARE JUST A LOTMORE OPTIONS ON THE BACK OF A
CHINESE DRIVER'S LICENSE.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
