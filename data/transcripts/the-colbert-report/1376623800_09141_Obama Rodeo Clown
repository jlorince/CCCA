(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WE
ARE STILL-- IF YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEWS
BUSINESS, FOLKS, AUGUST IS
NOTORIOUSLY A SLOW NEWS
MONTH.
WHO CAN FORGET THE SUMMER OF
'75 WHEN WALTER CRONKITE DID
A TEN PART SERIES ON SPOONS,
THE MIDDLE CHILD OF THE
DINNER TABLE.
(LAUGHTER)
STILL, EVERY FEW AUGUSTS YOU
GET A STORY SO BIG YOU CAN'T
HELP BUT SINK YOUR TEETH
INTO IT.
AND TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO SAY
WE HAVE THE LATEST ON THE
GRIPPING STORY OF THE RODEO
CLOWN WHO PUT ON AN OBAMA
MASK.
(LAUGHTER)
YES, I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW.
SOME SAID THE MEDIA WOULD BE
THROWN OFF THIS RODEO STORY
IN A SECOND.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT NOBODY, NOBODY RIDES
THIS KIND OF BULL LIKE THE
HEROES OF CABLE NEWS.
JIM?
>> FROM THE STATE FAIR ASKED
THE CROWD IF THEY WANTED TO
SEE A RODEO CLOWN WITH AN
OBAMA MASK RUN DOWN BY A
BULL.
ANOTHER CLOWN PLAYING WITH
THE OBAMA MASK SLIPS.
>> A RODEO CLOWN WHO
PERFORMED DURING THE
MISSOURI STATE FAIR WHILE
WEARING A MASK OF PRESIDENT
OBAMA HAS BEEN BANNED FROM
PERFORMING AT THE MISSOURI
STATE FARE EVER AGAIN.
>> THE MISSOURI RODEO COWBOY
ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT, HE
ALSO RESIGNED IN THE MIDST
OF THIS CLOWN FALLOUT.
>> THERE IS SOME NEW FALLOUT
OVER THIS WHOLE RODEO CLOWN
ISSUE.
THE RODEO ANNOUNCER AT THE
EVENT NOW STEPPING DOWN AS
PRESIDENT OF MISSOURI'S
RODEO COWBOY ASSOCIATION HAS
ALL OF THIS GONE WAY TOO
FAR?
>> Stephen: OH, IT'S GONE
WAY TOO FAR.
THE CLOWN'S BEEN FIRED.
THE ANNOUNCER RESIGNED.
THE COWBOY ASSOCIATION'S
PRESIDENT HAS RESIGNED.
AND COUNTLESS BULLS HAVE
BEEN JABBED IN THE GONADS
WITH ELECTRIC CATTLE
PRODUCTS.
EXCUSE ME, I'M BEING TOLD
THAT LAST THING IS JUST PART
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT, CARRY
ON.
AND FOLKS, THIS STORY GOES
BEYOND THE GIANT POWER
VACUUM ATOP MISSOURI'S RODEO
COWBOY ASSOCIATION.
IT'S MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
AND NOBODY ADOES NOTHING
LIKE FOX NEWS DANA PERINO.
JIM.
>> RODEOS, EVERY PRESIDENT
IS ALWAYS MADE FUN OF.
THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF
RIDICULE.
THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF
ACHIEVEMENT, TO BE MADE FUN
OF BY THE RODEO CLOWN, IS
ACTUALLY SUCCESS.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL IF YOU
GET MADE FUN OF BY THE RODEO
CLOWN, YOU HAVE MADE IT.
>> EXACTLY.
I MEAN NOBEL PAEZ PEACE
PRIZE, MEH, FIRST BLACK
PRESIDENT, WHAT ELSE.
BUT THERE IS NO HIGHER HONOR
THAN HAVING A CLOWN RUN
AROUND A DIRT ARENA WEARING
A GROTESQUE MASK OF YOUR
FACE WHILE THE ANNOUNCER
ASKED THE CHEERING CROWD WHO
WANTS TO SEE THIS GUY
TRAMPLED?
AND YES, BARACK OBAMA HAS
NOT THANKED THE RODEO
CLOWNS.
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED.
HE NEVER SEEMED GRATEFUL
WHEN THE TEA PARTY HONORED
HIM WITH
