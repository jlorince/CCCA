WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS -- EARLIER THIS WEEK I
TOUCHED ON THE CANDIDACY OF NEWT
GINGRICH AND I BELIEVE SOME OF
IT IS STILL STUCK TO ME.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I LIKE THIS GUY'S CHANCES
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S
OVER BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS.
JUST BECAUSE WHILE NEWT WAS ON
THIS WEEK'S "MEET THE GREGORY"
HE SEEMS TO SUPPORT THE
REQUIREMENT THAT EVERYONE BUY
HEALTH INSURANCE IN OBAMA CARE.
>> I HAVE SAID CONSISTENTLY WE
OUGHT TO HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO
HAVE INSURANCE OR POST A BOND OR
INDICATE YOU'LL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.
>> THAT'S THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE, IS IT NOT?
>> IT'S A VARIATION.
>> Stephen: YES, JUST LIKE
WIFE FLEE SAY VARIATION OF WIVES
ONE AND TWO.
OF COURSE, NEWT'S HONESTY SO
ALARMED THE BELTWAY CROWD THEY
TOOK OFF THE BELTS AND SPANKED
NEWT'S ASS UNTIL IT WAS SO PINK
AND SWOLLEN IT LOOKED LIKE
NEWT'S FACE.
JIM?
>> I THINK THE NUMBER ONE THING
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO WHEN YOU
START A CAMPAIGN IS ALIENATE
YOUR POLITICAL BASE.
>> NEWT GINGRICH HAS CLEANING UP
TO DO IF HE'S GOING TO GET HIS
CAMPAIGN ROLLING AGAIN.
>> HE BLEW HIMSELF UP NOT JUST
AS A CANDIDATE BUT IN A REAL
SENSE AS A REPUBLICAN.
>> Jon: WRONG.
NEWT CAN'T BLOW UP ANY FURTHER.
HE IS ALREADY INFLATED TO
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES, FOLKS, IT'S ALL A
MISUNDERSTANDING.
AS NEWT EXPLAINED WHILE ON A
BREAK FROM SELLING ORANGES ON
THE SIDE OF ROAD.
>> ANY EFFORT TO IMPOSE A
FEDERAL MANDATE ON ANYONE IT'S
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG AND I
BELIEVE UN-- [HORN HONKING]
>> Stephen: SURE ON SUNDAY HE
WAS FOR INDIVIDUAL MANDATES AND
MONDAY HE FOUND IT
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
THINGS CHANGE.
MAYBE BETWEEN SUNDAY AND MONDAY
HE READ THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE
FIRST TIME.
HE KNOWS A GOOD LEADER VIEWS ALL
SIDES OF AN ISSUE.
A GREAT LEADER TAKES ALL SIDES
OF AN ISSUE.
HE TOLD NEWSWEEK PAUL RYAN WAS A
BRAVE MAN OF IDEAS.
BUT ON SUNDAY HE DISMISSED HIS
PLAN AS TOO RADICAL.
>> I DON'T THINK RIGHT WING
SOCIAL ENGINEERING IS ANY MORE
DESIRABLE THAN LEFT WING SOCIAL
ENGINEERING.
>> Stephen: THAT SET OFF THE
UNQUESTIONED LEADERS OF
REPUBLICAN PARTY, ANGRY MIDDLE
AGED WHITE GUYS.
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO PAUL
RYAN.
>> HE UNDERCUT HIMSELF -- HIM
AND HIS ALLIES IN THE HOUSE.
YOU ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE
PARTY.
GET OUT BEFORE YOU MAKE A FOOL
OF YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: OH, OH, HE'S A
FOOL, REALLY?
OH, REALLY.
HE'S A FOOL?
YOU ARE THE ONE AT A NEWT
GINGRICH RALLY.
EXCUSE ME, I'M BEING TOLD IN MY
DEAF EAR THAT NEWT GINGRICH HAS
APPEARED ON THE GETRA -- GRETA
VAN SUSTEREN SHOW.
>> ARE YOU SAYING YOU CHOSE THE
WRONG WORDS OR IT'S NOT WHAT YOU
THOUGHT?
>> YOU LISTEN TO THE QUESTION
DAVID GREGORY ASKED ME I SHOULD
HAVE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO
ANSWER IT.
>> Stephen: YES, NO ONE HAS
ANY REASON TO BE UPSET ABOUT
NEWT'S IDEAS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.
BESIDES NEWT GRANTED HIMSELF
FULL IMMUNITY FROM HIMSELF.
>> LET ME SAY ON THE RECORD ANY
AD WHICH QUOTES WHAT I SAID ON
SUNDAY IS SAY FALSEHOOD.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
ANY ACCURATE QUOTE OF WHAT NEWT
SAID ARE FALSEHOODS ABOUT WHAT
NEWT SAID BECAUSE --
>> I HAVE SAID PUBLICLY THOSE
WORDS WERE INACCURATE.
>> Stephen: SO --
[LAUGHTER]
-- THE MORE ACCURATE YOU ARE
ABOUT HIS INACCURACIES, THE MORE
FALSE YOU'LL BECOME -- I NEED
SOME HELP.
[LAUGHTER]
LUCKILY I HAVE THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED CANDIDATE TRACKING
TECHNOLOGY.
PLEASE WELCOME THE PANDER TRON
8,000.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HI PANDER TRON.
>> PANDER TRON LOVES STEPHEN,
MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD.
>> Stephen: NOT NOW PANDER
TRON, NOT NOW.
ENTER POLITICAL MODE.
>> POLITICAL MODE ENGAGED.
ENTER TALKING POINTS DATA.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO
UPLOAD NEWT'S STATEMENT ABOUT
PAUL RYAN AND PROCESS.
>> ANALYZING, ANALYZING.
>> ANY AD WHICH QUOTES WHAT NEWT
GINGRICH SAID ON SUNDAY IS FALSE
BUT HIS ARRESTEDS ARE FALSE.
TWO EQUAL FALSES, ERRORS,
ERRORS, ERRORS, ERRORS!
>> Stephen: IT'S JUST A LITTLE
GLITCH, FOLKS.
>> CANNOT RECONCILE HUMAN
CONTRADICTION.
MUST KILL HUMANS.
KILL, KILL, KILL.
>> Stephen: NO PANDER TRON, I
