>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
OF RULES FOR EATING.
RULE NUMBER ONE-- DO NOT EAT THE
BOOK.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL POLLIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MICHAEL.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK.
>> Stephen:  THIRD TIME HERE.
>> YEAH, AND YOU REMEMBER THE
LAST TIME.
>> Stephen:  LET PEE GET YOUR
FREQUENT INTERVIEW CARD.
THERE ARE YOU.
ONE MORE AND YOU GET A FREE
FOOT-LONG.
>> LAST TIME I WAS HERE YOU GAVE
ME A SODA, A SIERRA MIST.
>> Stephen:  I DID, YEAH.
>> A REALLY NASTY PRODUCT.
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
>> SO I THOUGHT --
>> Stephen:  THEY'RE A
SPONSOR, SIR.
I WILL HAVE YOU BEATEN.
>> I THOUGHT I WOULD BRING YOU
SOMETHING --
>> Stephen:  WHAT IS WHATIS
THIS?
>> A LITTLE BETTER.
THIS IS SOME HOME BREW MY SON
AND I MADE.
>> Stephen:  IF YOU DON'T LIKE
IT, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO
ABOUT IT.
>> THIS IS YOUR BEER.
>> Stephen:  THAT LOOKS GOOD.
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.
( LAUGHTER )
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen:  THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.
DON'T DO THAT.
SOME BUGLES.
>> OH!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  YOUR BEER IS
SALTY.
( LAUGHTER )
MICHAEL, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU--
PLEASE, DRINK UP.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S DELICIOUS.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen:  WILL WHICH GET ME
( BLEEP )?
>> IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM,
YEAH.
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
OKAY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE AWGHT "IN DEFENSE OF
FOOD."
YOU'RE THE BIG, BOSSY FOOD NAZI
OUT THERE, ALL RIGHT, FOOD NAZI.
>> I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.
>> Stephen:  FOOD-STAPO.
IS THAT BETTER?
IS THAT SOFTER?
>> YOU KNOW, ALL THE RULES IN
THIS BOOK, THIS IS THE WISDOM OF
YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.
>> Stephen:  LET'S GET TO THE
BOOK HERE.
YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED," FOOD
RULES:  AN EATER'S MANUAL."
AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY
ILLUSTRATED.
SO WHY DO I NEED A BOOK OF FOOD
RULES?
I KNOW HOW TO EAT.
I PUT IT IN MY MOUTH.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I THINK THAT YOU GET IN
TROUBLE WHEN YOU'RE DECIDING
WHAT TO PUT IN YOUR MOUTH.
I THINK THAT'S THE KEY MOMENT,
AND--
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  NO.
NO UPON I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE--
I BELIEVE HERMAIN CAIN GOT IN
TROUBLE DECIDING WHAT TO PUT IN
HIS MOUTH.
( LAUGHTER ).
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I PUT-- I'M AN OMNIVORE.
BY YOUR OWN TITLE OF YOUR OTHER
BOOK, I CAN PUT ANYTHING IN MY
MOUTH.
>> WELL, YOU CAN BUT SOME THINGS
ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU SICK AND
SOME THINGS ARE GOING TO
PREDISPOSE YOU TO HEART DISEASE
AND DIABETES.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK BECAUSE
OF THE DIET THEY'RE EATING.
>> Stephen:  HOW DO YOU KNOW?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
YOU'RE A SKINNY GUY.
YOU'RE A THIN GUY OVER THERE.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
FOOD?
I MEAN IF MARIO BOTELLI CAME OUT
HERE, IF YOU HAD TO BE BROUGHT
OUT HERE WITH A FORK LIFT THEN I
WOULD LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAD TO
SAY ABOUT FOOD BUT WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?
>> THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF
AUTHORITY.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT FOOD.
I'LL BE HONEST, I'M NOT AN
EXPERT --
>> Stephen:  OH, YOU SURE PLAY
ONE ON TV.
( LAUGHTER ).
GO AHEAD, YEAH.
>> BUT I REALIZED AT A CERTAIN
POINT THAT WE'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO SCIENTISTS FOR TOO LONG, AND
THEY'VE REALLY MISLED US, AS
HAVE THE HEALTH CLAIMS ON THE
PRODUCTS.
THE WHOLE NUTRITIONAL
INDUSTRIAL
--
>> Stephen:  WE HAVE TRUTH IN
ADVERTISING.
HOW COULD THE PRODUCT MISLEAD
ME.
>> CEREAL THAT PROMISES TO
IMPROVE YOUR SON'S FOCUS AT
SCHOOL, PREVENT SWINE FLU.
THEY'RE ALL BRAGGING ABOUT
THEY'RE GOING TO IMPROVE YOUR
HEART HEALTH.
THEY'RE GOING TO, YOU KNOW, HELP
IMPROVE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM.
THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION OUT
THERE.
SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IN THIS
BOOK IS SIMPLY CUT THROUGH IT
WITH SOME COMMON-SENSE RULES.
IT'S A DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE BOOK.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARE THERE LIKE TAX CUTS?
ARE THOSE GOOD?
ARE THOSE GOOD FOR THE FOOD?
>> NO, I THINK WE NEED MORE
TAXES ON OTHER THAN CERTAIN
KINDS OF FOOD, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen:  WHAT WOULD YOU
TAX?
>> SODA.
>> Stephen:  YOU WOULD TAX
COCA-COLA?
( APPLAUSE )
NO, YOU, YOU, SHUT UP!
YOU WOULD TAX SODA?
THAT IS THE MILK OF AMERICA.
( LAUGHTER )
HOW YOU CAN TAX SODA?
WE BEAT HITLER WITH COCA-COLA.
>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE-- IF
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS CHANGED THE
AMERICAN DIET OVER THE LAST 30
YEARS --
>> Stephen:  LOOT LETME GUESS,
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.
>> IT'S A PROBLEM.
>> Stephen:  GET A NEW
HOBBYHORSE.
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE RULES.
JIM, LET'S LOOK AT ONE OF THE
RULES UP HERE.
BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATION.
FOOD IS A COSTLY ANTIDEPRESSANT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> WE EAT FOR A LOT OF REASONS
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
HUNGER.
WE EAT WHEN WE'RE BORED.
WE EAT WHEN WE'RE SAD.
WE EAT WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE TO DO.
I HAVE A LOT OF RULES TO HELP
YOU DO THAT.
ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS IF YOU'RE
NOT HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT AN
APPLE, YOU'RE NOT REALLY HUNGRY.
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO KIND OF QUIZ
YOURSELF.
>> Stephen:  WOW, THAT IS A
SLAM ON THE APPLE INDUSTRY OVER
THERE.
( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY, LOOK AT THE NEXT ONE.
>> BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, THOUGH, I
SAY EAT AN APPLE.
>> Stephen:  EAT AN APPLE.
ALL RIGHT.
THE NEXT ONE HERE IS A DESK IS
NOT A TABLE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  BUT SO MANY
PEOPLE'S TABLES IS THEIR DESK.
THEY EAT AT WORK, AND IF YOU
LEAVE YOUR DESK TO EAT, YOU WILL
BE FIRED.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WELL, THAT'S A HIGH PRICE TO
PAY BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE
WE'VE GOT TO TREAT MEAL TIME--
TAKE IT A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY.
EAT FOOD AT MEALS-- I KNOW IT'S
A RADICAL IDEA.
WE EAT TOO FAST.
WE EAT ON THE RUN.
WE EAT AT WORK.
WE EAT IN THE CAR.
20% OF MEALS IN AMERICA ARE
EATEN IN THE CAR.
>> Stephen:  ABSOLUTELY.
>> THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
>> Stephen:  WE'RE A COUNTRY
ON THE GO.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CUP HOLDERS
WHICH YOU CAN ALSO FILL WITH
GRAVY.
GET YOUR CHICKEN WINGS.
>> SO I'M PREACHING A VERY
SIMPLE IDEA-- RETURN TO THE
CONCEPT OF A MEAL AND EATING ON
THE RUN, YOU EAT MORE.
WHEN YOU EAT IN FRONT OF THE
TELEVISION, YOU EAT MORE.
YOU'RE DISTRACTINGED.
>> Stephen:  BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALSO BEING ENCOURAGED.
YOU MIGHT THINK, HEY, MAYBE I'LL
HAVE SHOULD BUGLES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  THE LAST ONE
HERE, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
A LAND WITH LOTS OF HERRING CAN
GET ALONG WITH FEW DOCTORS.
>> NOW THERE IS WISDOM.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS WISDOM
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE EATING
HERRING, CHANCES ARE YOU'RE IN
SCANDINAVIA AND CHANCES ARE YOU
DON'T NEED A DOCTOR BECAUSE YOU
BLEW YOUR BRAINS OUT AT 25.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ).
>> BUT, FREE HEALTH CARE FOR
EVERYBODY.
>> Stephen:  FREE HEALTH CARE
FOR THOSE WHO SURVIVE.
>> WHO SURVIVE, RIGHT.
WHO ARE BAD SHOTS.
>> Stephen:  MICHAEL, IT'S
ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE LECTURED
TO ABOUT THE THINGS I PUT IN MY
MOUTH.
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOUR BOOKS.
THIS ONE IS CALLED, "FOOD RULES:
AN EATER'S MANUAL."
MICHAEL POLLIN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
