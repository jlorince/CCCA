I WANT TO SAY "CHIP"?
THOUGH THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT MOVES ON THE ROMNEY, FOLKS, THESE DAYS ALL POLITICIANS HAVE A POWERFUL
MEDIA OUTLET AT THEIR DISPOSAL -- TWITTER.
AND NO REPUBLICAN USES IT MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN 78-YEAR-OLD CYBERPUNK SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY.
OVER THE WEEKEND, GRASSLEY CAUSED A TWITTER STORM BY RESPONDING TO OBAMA'S CRITICISM
OF THE SUPREME COURT WITH THIS TWEET: "CONSTITUENTS ASKED WHY I AM NOT OUTRAGED AT
POST-TRAUMATIC PREZO ATTACKS." TOUGH TALK?
SURE.
TOUGH TO UNDERSTAND?
OH, YEAH.

HIS PROCESS, SAYING "I LOVE TWEETING, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO TYPE."
I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS.
I LOVE COOKING, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO CHOP.
STILL, YOU SHOULD TRY MY SALSA.
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM.
MMM, MMM, MMM.
MM.
CHUNKY.
OF COURSE, MY FAVORITE AVANT-GARDE GRASSLEY TWEET IS THIS MINIMALIST MASTERPIECE FROM EARLY MARCH.
IT WORKS ON SO MANY LEVELS.
