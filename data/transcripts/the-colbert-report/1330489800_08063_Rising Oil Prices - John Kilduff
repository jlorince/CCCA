REACHED MY GOAL.
20 MORE MINUTES!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT EVEN ON A JOYOUS OCCASION
LIKE TONIGHT, THERE'S A CLOUD
LOOMING:
BARACK OBAMA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WITH THE ECONOMY ON THE UPSWING,
HIS APPROVAL RATING HAS SOARED
TO 53%, AND HE WOULD TROUNCE
BOTH ROMNEY AND SANTORUM BY
DOUBLE-DIGITS.
BUT THAT'S ONLY AFTER 20
DEBATES.
AMERICA DON'T KNOW THEM YET.
LUCKILY, THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
THAT COULD PUT THE BRAKES ON.
OBAMA'S MOMENTUM.
>> GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO SOAR
WITH NO RELIEF IN SIGHT.
>> CAN'T GET A BREAK WHEN IT
COMES TO GAS PRICES.
REGULAR SHOT UP 12 CENTS
NATIONWIDE, THE AVERAGE PRICE
FOR A GALLON OF GAS?
$3.64
>> WHEN OIL AND GAS PRICES GO
UP, FLIGHT PRICES GO UP TOO, SO
THAT COULD MEAN FEWER PEOPLE
DRIVING.
>> SPUN OUT RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
DID YOU SEE THAT?
>> I CAN'T.
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOTTEN
IN AN ACCIDENT OUT HERE.
>> PROBABLY SHOCKED ABOUT IT GAS
PRICES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: YES, GAS PRICES ARE
SO HIGH, OUR CARS HAVE LOST
THEIR WILL TO LIVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO IS TO
BLAME.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE PRESIDENT HE
HAS PERSONAL CONTROL OVER THE
OIL SUPPLY.
DID YOU KNOW BEFORE THIS
PRESIDENT EISENHOWER USED TO
PUMP YOUR GAS?
FOLKS, NO ONE WILL EVER CONVINCE
ME THAT OBAMA CAN'T SINGLE
HANDEDLY BRING DOWN OIL PRICES.
HERE TO CONVINCE ME IS OIL
ANALYST AND HEAD OF AGAIN
CAPITAL, JOHN KILDUFF.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
HAVE A SEAT.
WHY ISN'T OBAMA PICKING UP THE
MAGIC RED PHONE AND TELLING
EXXON TO DROP THEIR PRICES.
BECAUSE HE CAN'T.
>> HE CAN.
>> CAN HE NOT.
>> THE WORLD MARKET SETS THE
PRICES.
>> THE UNITED STATES IS A
SUPERPOWER.
HE IS HEAD OF THE SUPERPOWER.
HE NEEDS TO THROW THE MUSCLE
AROUND AND SAY TO SAUDI
ARABIA --
>> HAS NO CONTROL.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND UH-UH.
>> HE HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE
MARKETS IN EUROPE AND LONDON
BASED ON WHAT IS PRODUCED,
CONSUMER AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S
NOT THREATENED WHERE IT'S
PRODUCE.
>> GIVE ME THIS, EVERY SPRING
THAT OBAMA HAS BEEN PRESIDENT
THE OIL PRICES ARE CREEPED UP.
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.
>> IT'S COINCIDENCE WITH THE
SUMMER TIME DRIVING SEASON.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S A COINCIDENCE
THAT PEOPLE DRIVE MORE WHEN
OBAMA IS PRESIDENT IN THE
SUMMER.
>> NO, SIR, IT HAPPENS EVERY
YEAR.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
ARE THERE FORCES OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTING TO
THIS.
>> WE IMPORT TWO-THIRDS OF OIL.
WHEN WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT IRAN
TRYING TO GET A NUCLEAR BOMB.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S AN OBAMA
FAILURE RIGHT THERE.
IRAN GETTING A BOMB.
THAT'S THE FAILURE.
WHY NOT INVADE IRAN AND TAKE
THEIR OIL?
>> I THINK YOU SEE HOW WELL THAT
HAS GONE FOR US WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT INVADING IRAQ.
IRANIAN ONES ARE ALL THE
MARBLES.
NOT ONLY WILL THEIR OIL BE
AFFECTED.
IF THEY ARE ATTACKED THEY
PROMISE TO CHOKE OFF A PRECIOUS
BODY OF WATER CALLED THE STRAIT
OF HORMUZ WHERE THE OIL COMES
THROUGH.
THEY ARE THREATENING TO BLOCK
THE SHIPMENT OF THE OIL.
>> STEPHEN: HERE IS ANOTHER
OBAMA FAILURE, KEYSTONE, XL
PIPELINE.
WE WOULDN'T BE DEPARTMENT UPON
OUGHT ARABS IF WE COULD GET THE
XL PIPELINE.
IF HE HADN'T CANCELED IT, I
WOULD BE BRUSHING MY TEETH WITH
GSO LEAN RIGHT NOW.
WOULDN'T THAT CHANGE, BRING THE
PRICE DOWN LIKE TOUT SWEUT.
>> EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN YOU BRING
OIL IN IT GOES DOWN.
>> THE PIPELINE IS YEARS AWAY.
WE NEED IT FOR THE ENERGY
SECURITY GOING FORWARD.
I'M FOR IT.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT WILL
ALTERNATIVE FUEL.
>> ABSOLUTELY AND WE ARE.
>> STEPHEN: THE PRESIDENT IS
TALKING
TALK POURING ALGAE IN OUR
TANKSEN THE ALGAE MAKES FUEL
THAT WE CAN BURN IN THE CARS.
THEY MAKE -- IT'S A SUBSTITUTE
FOR ETHANOL.
THE WAY CORN TURN INTO ETHANOL.
EXXON SMOABL DEVELOPING A
COMMERCIAL SCALE PLANT THAT
TURNS ALLEGE YEAH INTO ETHANOL.
>> STEPHEN: YOU KNOW WHAT I
THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH?
PUPPIES?
HEAR ME OUT.
WE PUT PEANUT BUTTER ON THE
TURBINE BLADE AND THEY LICK OUR
WAY TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.
WILL THAT WORK.
AS A PROFESSIONAL GOOD-YOUR
OPINION.
>> NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TOO OFFENSIVE.
PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS SWAL
YOKE THE DAMAGE OIL DOES TO THE
ENVIRONMENT IN OTHER WAYS.
I DON'T THINK KILLING PUPPIES
WILL GET US ANYWHERE.
>> STEPHEN: I SAID NOTHING
ABOUT KILLING PUPPIES.
GIVING THEM PEANUT BUTTER AND
ASKING THEM TO LICK IT OFF THE
TURBINE BLADE.
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE
OIL INDUSTRY?
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JOHN KI LDID YOU HAVE,
EV
