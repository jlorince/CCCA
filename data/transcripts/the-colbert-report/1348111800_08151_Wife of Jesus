>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW ON A REGULAR BASIS YOU KNOW I HAVE A CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS.
WE'RE SUPER TIME.
IN FACT, I TOOK THAT PICTURE ON MY iPHONE.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED TO HEAR THIS NEWS.
>> NEW EVIDENCE FROM AN ANCIENT TEXT THAT SUGGESTS JESUS  MAY HAVE BEEN MARRIED.
ON THIS SCRAPBOOK ARE THE EXPLOSIVE WORDS JESUS SAID TO THEM, "MY WIFE."
>> STEPHEN: MARRIED OH, CRAP WHAT IS IS THE RULE ON WEDDING GIFTS.
YOU HAVE 2,000 YEARS, SNRIET JC, SO HAPPY FOR YOU, MAZEL, BABY.
IT COMES AS A RELIEF.
YOU ARE A FIT DUDE, YOU WEAR SANDELS.
SPENT ALL YOUR TIME HANG AROUND WITH OTHER GUYS.
PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO TALK.
WHAT A CATCH, RIGHT, LADIES?
IT'S SO HARD TO FIND A NICE JEWISH BOY LET ALONE THE NICEST JEWISH BOY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND HIS DAD, SUPER WELL CONNECTED.
HE KNOWS EVERYBODY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT AS HAPPY AS I AM FOR MY BROSSEIAH THIS NEWS HAS BEEN BUMMED OUT.
JESUS WAS ONE OF MY LAST SINGER FRIENDS.
HE WASN'T JUST MY COPILOT HE WAS MY WING MAN.
I SETTLED DOWN BUT HE WAS A PARTY ANIMAL ALWAYS TURNING WATER INTO WINE, HANGING OUT PROSTITUTES BUT NOW HE HAS A
WIFE, YOU KNOW.
MR. AND MRS. JESUS AND HELEN CHRIST.
THE CHRIST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE.
WHEN I GO TO CONFESS MY SINS, YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO TELL HER.
YOU CAN'T HAVE SECRETS IN A MARRIAGE.
SHE'LL PROBABLY THROW IN HER TWO CENTS, YOU KNOW.
YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO FORGIVE FOR THAT?
NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT WITH A GLADE PLUG-IN.
YOU CAN FORGET THAT BEARD AND THE ROBE.
FROM NOW IT'S CLEAN SHAVEN AND A POLO SHIRT.
AND HE COMES AGAIN IN GLORY IT'S GOING BE A MINIVAN.
WE USED TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN.
WE WOULD BE ON THE BEACH.
I WOULD BE HAVING TROUBLE IN MY LIFE AND WOE CARRY ME ACROSS THE SAND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ING FOR THEAT BECAUSE NOW HE IS LEADED UP WITH BEACH CHAIRS AND A COOLER.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ON SUNDAYS?
WE USED TO WATCH THE GAME TOGETHER.
I GUESS VILE TO GO TO CHURCH.
LAME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
