(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
THANKS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANKS SO MUCH!
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I LOVE THEOLIVE GARDEN.
IT REALLY EVOKES THE AUTHENTICCUISINE OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE
SPOTS IN ITALY -- THE OLIVEGARDEN IN ROME.
(LAUGHTER)AND JUST LIKE THE SLOGAN SAYS,
WHEN I'M THERE, I'M FAMILY.
WHICH IS WHY, WHEN I'M THERE, IWATCH TV IN MY UNDERWEAR.
(LAUGHTER)UNFORTUNATELY, MY FAVORITE CHAIN
JUST GOT KICKED IN THEMEATBALLS.
>> A MAJOR INVESTOR ISATTEMPTING A TAKEOVER OF
OLIVE GARDEN RELEASING 300 PAGESTHAT SLAM THE RESTAURANT
CHAIN'S FOOD AND SERVICE.
>> THE INVESTMENT GROUP RIPPEDINTO THE COMPANY FOR EVERYTHING
FROM SOGGY SALADS TO TASTELESSPASTA.
>> IN WHAT WOULD BE A DANGEROUSINSULT TO HURL AT MOST ITALIAN
COOKS, IT CALLS THE PASTA MUSHYAND UNAPPEALING.
>> THEY MIGHT AS WELL SAY WE'RENOT EVEN ITALIAN.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, OLIVEGARDEN IS ITALIAN!
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THEIRCORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ARE IN
ORLANDO. THAT IS MEREMILES FROM EPCOT ITALY!
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, THE REPORT, THIS
REPORT THAT JUST GOT PUT OUTBY THESE INVESTORS IS ALL PART
OF THE HEDGE FUND "STARBOARDVALUES'" AGGRESSIVE ATTEMPT TO
TAKE CONTROL OF THE OLIVEGARDEN'S PARENT COMPANY,
DARDEN RESTAURANTS.
I MEAN, IT'S A HOSTILE-PITALIANOTAKEOVER!
(LAUGHTER)STARBOARD LAID OUT THEIR CASE IN
AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EATPOWERPOINT PRESENTATION.
SLIDE 164 ASKS THE QUESTION, HOWDOES THE LARGEST ITALIAN DINING
CONCEPT IN THE WORLD NOTSALT THE WATER FOR PASTA?
ADDING -- IF YOU WERE TO GOOGLE"HOW TO COOK PASTA," THE FIRST
STEP OF PASTA 101 IS TO SALT THEWATER.
FIRST OF ALL, I THINKIT'S PRETTY CLEAR.
NOBODY AT OLIVE GARDEN ISGOOGLING "HOW TO COOK PASTA."
AND MAYBE THEY DON'T SALT THEWATER, BUT THEY MAKE UP FOR THAT
BY PUTTING SALT IN EVERYTHINGELSE -- THE SAUCE, THE SALAD,
THE SOFT DRINKS, THE SALT.
BELIEVE ME, NO ONE HAS EVER LEFTTHE OLIVE GARDEN SAYING "I NEED
MORE SODIUM."
BUT HERE'S WHERE STARBOARD WENTOVERBOARD.
>> ONE HEDGE FUND SAYS IT HASTHE ANSWER TO THE RESTAURANT'S
MONEY WOES -- TOO MANYBREADSTICKS.
STARBOARD VALUE SAYS OLIVEGARDEN'S SERVERS BRING TOO MANY
BREADSTICKS TO THE TABLE AT ATIME.
>> WHO KNEW THERE WAS SUCH ATHING AS TOO MANY BREADSTICKS!
>> Stephen: WHAT THE (BLEEP)!
STARBOARD, STARBOARD WANTS TOLIMIT MY BREADSTICKS?
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?
EAT LIMITED BREAD IN NON-STICKFORM?
WHAT ARE WE?
ANIMALS?
FOLKS, I AM SHOCKED BY THISBLATANT ATTEMPT BY A FEW
WALL STREET BIGSHOTS TO TAKEAWAY OUR CARBOHYDRATE RODS.
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT HEDGEFUND MANAGERS WERE ON THE SIDE
OF THE LITTLE GUY...
BUT I'M BEGINNING TO WONDERWHETHER WALL STREET REALLY HAS
EVERYONE'S BEST INTERESTS ATHEART.
(LAUGHTER)DESTROYING THE WORLD ECONOMY IS
ONE THING, BUT I DRAW THE LINEWHEN THEY COME FOR MY
COMPLIMENTARY DINNER RODS.
WALL STREET, DO YOU NOT REALIZETHAT YOU'RE MEDDLING WITH FORCES
BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION?
THE ONLY THING PREVENTING THEMASSES FROM RISING UP AGAINST
YOU WAS THAT THEY WERE ALL TOOLOGY FROM THE BREADSTICKS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NOW IT'S GO TIME,
MOTHER (BLEEP)! I SAY WE BRINGDOWN THE WALL STREET FAT CAT
PORTION-LIMIT-STAPO.
WHO'S WITH ME?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)LET'S GET 'EM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST SCRATCH THAT. I'M JUST GONNA,
I'M JUST GONNA UNBUTTON MY PANTSFOR A SECOND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
