OF COURSE, THESE DAYS THERE'SSTILL ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU'RE
ALLOWED TO ATTACK-- WHITE GUYS.
SURPRISE!
CASE IN POINT, NEVADA RANCHERAND EXTRA FROM "SMOKEY AND THE
BANDIT," CLIVEN BUNDY.
I KNOW, I LIKE HIM, TOO.
FREQUENT VIEWERS OF MY SHOW KNOWTHAT I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL
YOU ABOUT CLIVEN FOR WEEKS.
BUT HERE'S THE STORY.
BUNDY'S CATTLE WERE SEIZED BYTHE FEDERAL BUREAU OF LAND
MANAGEMENT UNDER THE FLIMSYEXCUSE THAT HE'S GRAZED HIS
CATTLE ON FEDERAL LAND FORDECADES AND OWES $1 MILLION IN
GRAZING FEES.
$1 MILLION TO LET COWS EAT.
WHAT ARE THEY GROWING IN THATDESERT, LOBSTER TAILS?
BUT BUNDY HAS A SIMPLEEXPLANATION FOR NOT PAYING.
>> I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE UNITEDSTATES GOVERNMENT AS EVEN
EXISTING.
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen:  OKAY, YOU CAN'T
PAY A GOVERNMENT IF ITDOESN'T EXIST.
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THE MONEYTHAT IT ISSUED.
...
( LAUGHTER )BY BRAVELY STANDING AGAINST THE
FORCES OF PAYING YOUR BILLS,BUNDY BECAME A HERO TO
CONSERVATIVES LIKE SEAN HANNITYWHO TURNED BUNDY'S 10 GALLON HAT
UP TO 11.
>> MY NEXT GUEST IS A RANCHERWAGING A BATTLE AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT.
BACK WITH US IS CLIVEN BUNDY.
BACK WITH US IS CLIVEN BUNDY.
AND BACK WITH US TONIGHT TORESPOND IN A HANNITY EXCLUSIVE
IS RANCHER CLIVEN BUNDY.
CLIVEN, I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOUAS THE CONTROVERSY IS UNFOLDING.
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SEEM LIKEREALLY NICE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen:  MAN, HANNITY ATEUP THAT STORY SO HARD, BUNDY
SHOULD HAVE CHARGED HIM GRAZINGFEES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND THANKS, THANKS TO SEAN'SSYMPATHETIC COVERAGE, ARMED
PATRIOTS FLOCKED TO BUNDY'SRANCH TO DEFEND HIS RIGHTS.
>> WE WERE ACTUALLY STRATEGIZINGTO PUT ALL THE WOMEN UP AT THE
FRONT.
IF THEY'RE GOING TO STARTSHOOTING, IT WILL BE WOMEN THAT
WILL BE TELEVISED ALL ACROSS THEWORLD GETTING SHOT BY THESE
ROGUE FEDERAL OFFICERS.
OFFICERS.
>> Stephen:  NOW, THAT'S NOTAS MONSTROUS AS IT SOUNDS.
I'M SURE THEY WERE GOING TOPROTECT THE WOMEN WITH A LINE OF
CHILDREN.
( APPLAUSE )NOW, NO SURPRISE, THE FEDS DID
NOT HAVE THE SACK TO SHOOTTHROUGH A LADY LINE, SO THEY
PACKED IT IN.
AND IN THAT MOMENT OF VICTORYAGAINST AN ENCROACHING FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT, CLIVEN BUNDY BECAMEMORE THAN JUST A MAN.
>> THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER OFSUPPORTERS FOR RANCHER CLIVEN
BUNDY, ALL VOWING TO STANDBEHIND A MAN WHO HAS BECOME
THEIR HERO.
>> A SAVIOR, IF YOU WILL, OR ASYMBOL OF RURAL AMERICA STANDING
UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISA HERO, A FOLK HERO IF YOU WILL.
>> Stephen:  OH, I WILL.
( LAUGHTER )AND LIKE EVERY FOLK HERO, HE
DESERVES A FOLK SONG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )♪ HIS NAME WAS CLIVEN BUNDY
A OF BUNKERVILLE, NEVADA.
♪ IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIS STORY ITHINK YOU REALLY OUGHTTA.
♪ BACK IN 1993, THE FEDS DEMANDGRAZING FEES ON PUBLIC LAND THE
BUNDY PLAN SINCE THE 1870s.
BUNDY PLAN SINCE THE 1870s.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
♪ NEVADA STATE DECREE FROM 1953GAVE FEDERAL AUTHORITY OVER ALL
STATE PUBLIC PROPERTY.
♪ AS STATED IF THEGUADALUPE-HIDALGO TREATY
( APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )BUT CLIVEN COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND, WHY SHOULD HE HAVETO PAY FOR LAND?
THIS LAND BELONGS TO YOU AND ME.
THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD SEANHANNITY.
♪ THIS IS THE BALLAD OFCLIVEN BUNDY.
TAKE IT.
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE MORETHING I KNOW ABOUT THE NEGRO.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, THAT'SENOUGH OF THE SONG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
UNFORTUNATELY, NOTHING RHYMESWITH NEGRO.
OKAY, LET'S SEE, WHERE-- WHEREWERE WE?
OH, YES, CLIVEN BUNDY.
( LAUGHTER )CLIVEN, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT OUR AFRICAN AMERICANBRETHREN?
>> THEY ABORT THEIR-- THEIRYOUNG CHILDREN.
THEY PUT THEIR YOUNG MEN IN JAILBECAUSE THEY NEVER LEARNED HOW
TO PICK COTTON.
AND I'VE OFTEN WONDERED ARE THEYBETTER OFF ENSLAVED, PICKING
COTTON.
>> Stephen:  CALM DOWN.
THAT'S NOT RACIST.
THAT'S BEING EXISTENT.
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT WOULD
BE HYPOCRITICAL TO BELIEVE THEEMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.
I'M SURE HE HAD A CHANCE TOCLARIFY THE STATEMENT.
>> ARE THEY HAPPIER NOW UNDERTHE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY SYSTEM
THAN THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERESLAVES AND THEY WAS ABLE TO HAVE
THEIR FAMILY STRUCTURE TOGETHERAND THE CHICKENS AND GARDENS,
AND THE PEOPLE HAVE SOMETHING TODO?
>> Stephen:  WELL, THATCERTAINLY MAKES IT CRYSTAL
CLEAR.
HE LEFT THE CHICKENS OUT THEFIRST TIME.
THEY REALLY TIE THE WHOLE IDEATOGETHER.
THE POINT IS, THIS MAN IS AVICTIM OF RACISM, AS IT MADE
CLEAR ON THE BUNDY FACEBOOK PAGESAYING, "CLIVEN IS A GOOD MAN.
HE LOVES ALL PEOPLE.
HE IS NOT A RACIST MAN.
HE WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOREVERYONE."
OKAY, HE WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOREVERYONE.
AND HE'S JUST WONDERING IF FORSOME PEOPLE THAT'S SLAVERY.
( LAUGHTER )IS IT A CRIME TO WONDER NOW?
AND, FOLKS, MY ONE REGRET HEREIS THAT I DID NOT EMBRACE CLIVEN
BUNDY SOONER, LIKE SEAN HANNITYDID, YOU KNOW, REALLY DRAW HIM
TO MY BOSOM, TO LINK USINEXTRABLY,  TO HANG HIM
AROUND MY NECK LIKE SOME KIND OFLUCKY DEAD SEA BIRD.
BUT YOU BEAT ME TO IT, SEAN.
YOU'RE GOOD, BUDDY.
YOU'RE GOOD.
THANKS TO YOUR NONSTOP SUPPORTOF COVERAGE OF BUNDY, NOW WHEN
ANYONE THINKS OF FOLKS WHO HAVEINSIGHT INTO THE NEGRO, THEY'LL
THINK OF SEAN HANNITY.
I MEAN, THESE TWO--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THESE TWO GO TOGETHER TO LIKE KUAND KLUX.
I MEAN-- SALUTE YOU, SEAN.
I SALUTE YOU FOR BRAVELYSTANDING BY A MAN WHOSE ONLY
CRIME WAS BREAKING FEDERAL LAW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
