BEFORE WE GET STARTED, IUNDERSTAND YOUR ENTHUSIASM,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DON'TGET ME WRONG, I UNDERSTAND.
BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,BEFORE WE GET STARTED I JUST
WANT TO ADDRESS A HORRIBLETRAGEDY IN THE UKRAINE.
EARLIER TODAY A MALAYSIANAIRLINES FLIGHT CARRYING 295
PASSENGERS AND CREW CRASHEDAPPARENTLY BROUGHT DOWN BY A
MISSILE.
IT IS AN UNTHINKABLE LOSS ANDOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE
WITH EVERYONE AFFECTED BYTHIS SENSELESS ACT.
AND THERE IS MORE TROUBLE INTHE MIDDLE EAST AFTER TEN
DAYS OF TRADING MISSILELAUNCHES EARLIER TODAY THERE
WAS A BRIEF TALK OF ACEASE-FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL
AND HAMAS.
THAT BROKE DOWN AS BOTHSIDES COULD AGREE ON THE
FIRE PART, NOT SO OF THECEASE.
(LAUGHTER)AND NOW ISRAEL HAS SENT
GROUND TROOPS INTO GAZA.
THIS MAY SOUND FAMILIAR.
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT THANTHE LAST GAZA WAR IN THAT IT
IS HAPPENING NOW.
(LAUGHTER)AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT
DON'T KNOW, I TAPED THISSHOW EARLIER IN THE EVENING.
SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OFINFORMATION ON THESE
STORIES.
BUT WE WILL HAVE COMPLETECOVERAGE OF BOTH OF THESE
STORIES ON TOMORROW NIGHT'SSHOW AND I'M-- I'M BEING
TOLD WE DO NOT HAVE A SHOWON FRIDAY NIGHTS.
(LAUGHTER)OKAY.
OH THANK GOD.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THOSE ARE REALLY
DEPRESSING STORIES.
