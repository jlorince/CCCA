SONG HAS AN AWFUL LOT TO DO
WITH THE EVENTS OF THE DAY.

WOULD YOU BE MOTIVATED.
>> WELL, I THAT OPTION.
AND WHEN I LOOKED AT IT AND
TRIED TO BE REASONABLE ABOUT
WHAT TO DO, WITH SO MUCH
POWER, WITH SOME OF
ADULATION W SO MUCH PROFILE,
I THOUGHT THAT THE COMMUNITY
FROM WHICH I CAME WOULD BE
BETTER SERVED IF I WOULD
FOCUS A LIGHT ON WHAT
HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE
NOT QUITE AS FORTUNATE AS WE
ARE.

RESPONSIBILITY TO REACH INTO
THAT MISFORTUNE AND TRY TO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
