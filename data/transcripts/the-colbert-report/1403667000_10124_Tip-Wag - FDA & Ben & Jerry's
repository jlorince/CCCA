FOLKS, I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWOSIDES TO EVERY STORY-- MINE AND
THE OTHER ONE I HAVE.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER.
FOLKS, ANYBODY WHO KNOWS MEKNOWS I LOVE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
I LOVE HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE.
I LOVE HOW INTERCHANGEABLE THEIRBOTTLES LOOK.
IT'S LIKE PLAYING ENDOCRINEROULETTE.
ALSO I LOVE THE FIRST AMENDMENTWHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF
MY FINGER TO THE F.D.A. FORVIOLATING
BIG PHARMA'S FREEDOMOF TWEETS.
>> THE F.D.A. IS PROPOSING NEWGUIDELINES FOR DRUG INDUSTRY
POSTINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
DRUG COMPANIES POSTINGINFORMATION ON TWITTER, FOR
EXAMPLE, WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDETHE BENEFITS AND MAIN RISKS.
>> Stephen:  SORRY, YOUNG,HIP, TWITTER USERS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE TO LEARN THE DOPEST
NEWS ABOUT BONIVA.
OSTEOPEROSIS IS WHACK, YO.
UNDER THE NEW GUIDELINES, BIGPHARMA TWEETS WILL NOW HAVE TO
INCLUDE ALL SIDE EFFECTS ANDWARNINGS PRINTED ON THE PRODUCT
LABEL.
OH, COME ON!
THERE'S NO WAY THAT PFIZER COULDTELL ALL THEIR FOLLOWERS ALL THE
SIDE EFFECTS FOR VIAGRA INJUST 140 CHARACTERS.
VIAGRA HAS NINE SIDE EFFECTSINCLUDING PERMANENT DAMAGE TO
THE PENIS, LOSS OF SIGHT, ANDLOSS OF HEARING.
THAT IS SCARY STUFF.
I FOR ONE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IWOULD DO IF MY PENIS WENT BLIND
AND DEAF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IT WOULD HAVE TO GET A SERVICEDOG.
( LAUGHTER )WELL, AS ALWAYS, I AM HERE TO
HELP THE DRUG COMPANIES.
THERE'S A VERY SIMPLE WAY TOTREAT YOUR DRUG'S COMPLEX SIDE
EFFECTS -- EMOJIS.
EMOJIS CAN COVER EVERY POSSIBLESIDE EFFECT.
FOR DEPRESSION, JUST TWEET AFROWNY FACE.
RISK OF CARDIAC ARREST, A BROKENHEART.
EMOJIS CAN ALSO TELL PEOPLE TOAVOID THE DRUG IF THEY'RE
BIPOLAR.
OR THAT CLINICAL TRIALS CAUSEBLINDNESS IN MONKIES.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF THERE'SA RISK OF GENITAL PURPLING.
NEXT FOLKS--HUGE SIDE EFFECTFANS HERE TONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )NEXT UP, FOLKS, SUMMERTIME IS
UPON US, AND THAT MEANS EVERYONEIS WORKING TO PERFECT THEIR
SWIMSUIT BODY.
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED OUR
SWIMSUIT BODY, SUMMER ALSO MEANSICE CREAM.
NOW A RADICAL CHANGE AT BEN &JERRY'S HAS ME SO OUTRAGED THAT
I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM, WE ALLSCREAM AT ICE CREAM.
>> BEN & JERRY'S IS HOPINGCUSTOMERS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT
IS NOT GOING INTO THEIR ICECREAM.
ACCORDING TO THE BURLINGTONPRESS, BEN & JERRY'S IS
SWITCHING TO NON-G.M.O.
INGREDIENTS, WHICH MEANS SOME OFTHE FAVORITE RECIPES WILL BE
CHANGED.
GEMETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMSARE PLANTS OR ANIMALS WITH
D.N.A. THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED TOPRODUCE NEW GENES OR TRAITS
>> Stephen:  BEN & JERRY'S ISGETTING RID OF ALL GMO'S, WHICH
OF COURSE MEANS THE END OF THEIR
CONTROVERSIAL FLAVOR, THE ISLANDOF DR. MORE OREOS.
THEIR RASH DECISION IS A DIRECTTHREAT TO MY ICE CREAM, BECAUSE
IN A RECENT INTERVIEW AND JERRYWAS ASKED, WHAT IS YOUR
FAVORITE ICE CREAM FLAVOR?"AND HE SAID BEN & JERRY'S
AMERICONE DREAM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME!
BEN & JERRY'S AMERICONE DREAM.
CHECK THE LABEL.
IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S AMERICONEDREAM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THEY HAVE CUT OUT THE MOSTIMPORTANT INGREDIENT OF ALL--
ME.
WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN I MUST BE AGENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM.
I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.
I AM HIGHLY RESISTANT TO APHIDSAND-- AND-- AND I'M ROUND-UP
READY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )KIDS, KIDS, DON'T TRY THAT AT
HOME UNLESS YOUR PARENTS BOUGHTYOU FROM MONSANTO.
