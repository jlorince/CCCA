>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THEREPORT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN
HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THEWOULD.
NATIONS THE HOLIDAYS ARE UPON USAND SHE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M READY FOR SOME TRINKLING LIGHTS AND FROSTY THE
SNOWMAN, AND WALKING IN A WINTERWONDERLAND.
SPEAKING OF SNOW, COCAINE.
SAD, DRUG-RELATED NEWS THISWEEK, AND LIKE MOST SAD NEWS, IT
COMES FROM WASHINGTON.
JIM?
>> REPUBLICAN TREY RADEL OFFLORIDA TODAY PLEADED GUILTY TO
COCAINE POSSESSION.
>> HE PURCHASED THREE AND A HALFGRAMS OF COCAINE FROM AN
UNDERCOVER OFFICER.
>> THE TEA PARTY FAVORITEREPRESENTS FLORIDA'S 19th
DISTRICT.
>> Stephen:  YES, THIS RISINGTEA PARTY STAR WAS CAUGHT IN A
COKE BUST.
APPARENTLY HE FORGOT THE PART OFTHE TEA PARTY STORY WHERE YOU
DUMP THE PRODUCT IN THE HARBORBEFORE THE COPS SHOW UP.
FOLKS, PERSONALLY, I HATE TOLOSE A CONGRESSMAN SO FISCALLY
CONSERVATIVE THAT I'M SURE HESNORTED HIS BLOW THROUGH A $1
BILL.
AND SO COMMITTED TO FAMILYVALUES, FOLKS, THAT HE ACTUALLY
VOTED TO DRUG TEST PEOPLE WHORECEIVE FOOD STAMPS
( BOOING )NO, NO, NO.
HE'S NOT A HYPOCRITE.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GET FOODSTAMPS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
JUST HIS PAYCHECK.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN'T SAYI'M SURPRISED.
I'M BEEN ON THE COCAINE CONGRESSBEAT SINCE ROBERT WEXLER TOLD ME
THIS.
>> I ENJOY COCAINE BECAUSE IT'STHE FUN THING TO DO.
( APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  WHAT IS IT WITHFLORIDA CONGRESSMEN?
I MEAN, THERE MUST BE SOMETHINGIN THE WATER DOWN THERE.
AND I'M GUESSING IT'S COCAINE.
( LAUGHTER )BUT YOU KNOW, FOLKS, WE SHOULD
ALL HAVE SEEN RADEL'S TRIP DOWN8-BALL MOUNTAIN COMING.
WHEN RADEL RECORDED THIS SPANISHLANGUAGE MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE
OF COLOMBIA.
>> A MESSAGE FROM FLORIDACONGRESSMAN TREY RADEL TO THE
COLOMBIAN COMMUNITY.
LAST WEEK I WAS IN THEBEAUTIFUL, SPECTACULAR, AND
GROWING COUNTRY OF COLOMBIA.
IN PART, STRENGTHENING OURRELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLY AND
FRIEND COUNTRY.
BUT MOSTLY, TO SCORE COKE.
( LAUGHTER )SPECIFICALLY, I WANT A RELIABLE
SOURCE OF THE PUREST COLOMBIANCOKE.
FRANKLY, I'M TIRED OF MIDDLE MENDILUTING MY ( BLEEP ) WITH BABY
LAXATIVES.
SO I NEED TO CONNECT TO BEAM MEUP ON SOME OF THAT STRAIGHT,
COLOMBIAN GUTTER GLITTER.
WE CONSIDER SHARE IT AND THEN WEWILL DANCE AND DANCE AND DANCE.
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen:  SO BEST OF LUCK,
CONGRESSMAN.
WE WILL MISS YOU, AND OFCOURSE-- WHAT'S THAT?
HE'S NOT RESIGNING?
