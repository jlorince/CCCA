EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE NATIONAL
AFFAIRS EDITOR FOR "NEW YORK"
MAGAZINE AND POLITICAL ANALYST
FOR MSNPC.
HE'S HERE TO HIDE FROM ED
SCHULTZ.
PLEASE WELCOME JOHN HEILEMANN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, JOHN, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.
>> OH, I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE,
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE
HERE, YOU WERE HERE THE TALK
ABOUT YOUR 2008 TELL-ALL BOOK
"GAME CHANGE" WHICH YOU WROTE
WITH MARK HALPERIN.
IT WAS THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES
STORY OF THE 2008 CAMPAIGN.
YOU COBBLED TOGETHER THIS
INSIDER INFORMATION OFF THE
RECORD CONVERSATIONS.
YOU'RE ONE OF THESE POLITICAL
INSIDERS.
YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON BEHIND THE
SCENES.
IS THERE A LOT OF EGG ON YOU
GUYS' FACE THIS YEAR BECAUSE
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE IT
OUT.
YOU THINK IT'S COLONEL MUSTARD
WITH THE CANDLESTICK IN THE
CONSERVATORY.
TURNS OUT IT'S RICK SANTORUM
WITH A SWEATER VEST IN IOWA.
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW THIS YEAR.
>> NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING.
IT'S THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE YEAR
CERTAINLY IN MY POLITICAL LIFE
TIME.
THAT'S WHAT'S MAKE IT SUCH A
GRIPPING AND EXCITING CONTEST
AND SUCH GREAT FODDER FOR "GAME
CHANGE TWO"
>> Stephen: YOU'RE PLUGGING A
BOOK THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
YOU'RE REALLY A KING SHILL.
>> YOU STARTED IT.
>> Stephen: DID I?
LET'S END IT.
>> OKAY.
STOOP STEEP WHAT DO WE EXPECT
RIGHT NOW?
SANTORUM, THIS IS A VICTORY.
HE MIGHT HAVE LOST, BUT IT'S A
VICTORY.
>> OH, YEAH, LOOK.
THE NIGHT STARTED WITH RICK
SANTORUM IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE
POSITION, LIKE A NIGHTMARE
SCENARIO.
HE WAS IN A THREE-WAY WITH TWO
OTHER MEN.
AND THEN GRADUALLY RON PAUL FELL
BACK AND NOW HE'S IN THE
SITUATION WHERE HE WINS WHAT THE
SANTORUM CAMPAIGN WOULD CALL A
VIRTUAL TIE AND THE ROMNEY
CAMPAIGN WOULD CALL AN
EIGHT-VOTE LANDSLIDE.
HE COMES OUT WITH A HUGE AMOUNT
OF MOMENTUM OUT OF IOWA HAINES
NOW GOING TO GO UP TO NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND RUN WHAT I
THINK... WHAT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
PAT BUCHANAN'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST
BOB DOLE.
>> Stephen: POPULISM AND
PITCHFORKS?
HE'S A MODERN-DAY REAGAN.
>> REAGAN HAD THIS SUNNY
OPTIMISM AND HE SOUNDED
PRESIDENTIAL.
RICK SANTORUM IS KIND OF A
EARNEST FIGURE AND HE SOUNDS
MORE LIKE A COMBINATION OF EDDIE
HASKELL, JOHN KERRY AND JERRY
FALWELL.
IT'S LIKE SENATORIAL PLUS
RELIGIOUS, AND THAT'S NOT WHERE
REAGAN LIVED.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE GUY WHO TWO WEEKS, THREE
WEEKS AGO LOOKED LIKE THE GUY
WHO HAD THIS THING SOWN UP, NEWT
GINGRICH.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HE REALLY SEEMS LIKE HIS
NUMBER-ONE GOAL IS TO STICK A
SHARPENED SCREWDRIVER INTO MITT
ROMNEY'S LUNG.
>> YEAH.
THE TEDDY BEAR IS ANGRY.
AND THERE IS...
>> Stephen: THE CLAWS ARE OUT.
>> THERE IS NOTHING IN POLITICS
MORE FRIGHTENING THAN A
VINDICTIVE TEDDY BEAR.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S TRUE, BUT SOME PEOPLE SAID
HE WAS RUNNING TO BASICALLY GET
HIS BRAND OUT THERE AGAIN, GET
HIS SPEAKING FEES BACK UP, GET
ANOTHER BOOK OUT THERE AGAIN,
AND HE'S GOT THAT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
MORE, RIGHT?
SO NOW HE CAN JUST FOCUS HIMSELF
AND HE CAN JUST TURN HIMSELF
INTO A HUMAN WEAPON.
HE CAN JUST MARCH UP TO THE
ROMNEY CAMPAIGN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
AND GO,... HE DOES NOT CARE WHAT
HAPPENS TO HIM.
>> A WEIRD THING HAPPENS.
A LOT GO INTO IT THINK I'LL GO
ON A BOOK TOUR, HERMAN CAIN WAS
LIKE THIS, TOO.
I'LL SELL SOME BOOKS AND GET A
TALK SHOW ON FOX.
THEY BECOME A FRONT-RUNNER THAT.
MOMENT MAKES THEM THINK, HEY, I
COULD BE PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: IS IT ROMNEY'S
REALLY?
>> THE LAST TIME THERE WAS AN
INEVITABLE NOMINEE, IT WAS
HILLARY CLINTON, AND WE KNOW HOW
THAT WORKED OUT.
>> THERE ARE ONLY INEVITABLE
REPUBLICANS.
>> IT'S TRUE.
ROMNEY DID SOMETHING IN IOWA
THAT WAS IMPORTANT.
HE CRIPPLED THE TWO CANDIDATES
THEY WERE MOST WORRIED ABOUT,
RICK PERRY, AND GINGRICH
GINGRICH.
THEY THOUGHT THOSE GUYS COULD
BEAT ROMNEY.
THEY GOT THE TWO GUYS THEY
WANTED TO RUN AGAINST, RON PAUL
AND RICK SANTORUM.
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S 75% OF
THE PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY WHO DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR
MITT ROMNEY.
>> Stephen: WHY DON'T THEY
HAVE, WHEN THE TIME COME, I'LL
HOLD MY NOSE AND THINK OF
ENGLAND.
>> IT'S CLOSE YOUR EYES AND
THINK OF ENGLAND...
>> Stephen: NO, YOU'VE GOT TO
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.
>> EVEN IF IT'S NEWT GINGRICH?
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW IT'S NEWT
GINGRICH.
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.
THE 75% OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO
DON'T WANT MITT ROMNEY?
>> WHAT ABOUT THE HARD-CORE
CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT HARD-CORE
CONSERVATIVE.
DO THEY NOT GET A VOICE?
THEY'RE THE VAST MAJORITY.
>> THIS IS THE THREAT THAT
ROMNEY FACES IS HAVING NOW
EFFECTIVELY GOTTEN MICHELE
BACHMANN OUT OF THE RACE FOR
REAL, RICK PERRY IS PROBABLY
MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE RACE.
YOU COULD SEE A CONSOLIDATION OF
THE CONSERVATIVE HARD CORE TEA
PARTY PARTY, EVANGELICALS AROUND
RICK SANTORUM IN SOUTH CAROLINA
AS GINGRICH DOES THE THINGS THAT
YOU DESCRIBE, DESTROYING ROMNEY,
LAYING WASTE, PILLAGING, RAPING,
DOING WHATEVER HE HAS TO DO, AND
RICK SANTORUM OF ALL PEOPLE,
RICK SANTORUM COULD BE THE
CONSERVATIVE CONSENSUS CANDIDATE
WHO KNOCKS MITT ROMNEY OUT.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE
WONDERFUL.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE ENJOYABLE
IS WHAT I MEANT, TO REPORT ON.
>> IT WOULD BE AND, YOU KNOW, IT
WOULD... TO SEE RICK SANTORUM AT
THE TOP OF THE TICKET WOULD BE,
THE REPUBLICAN TICKET, HE WOULD
BE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET AND
WE'D SPECULATE ABOUT WHO IS
GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM.
>> Stephen: I SEE HIM AS A
TOP.
>> THIS MAY BE THE MOMENT FOR
YOU TO ANSWER A CALL TO SERVICE.
>> Stephen: AGAIN, I'LL CLOSE
MY EYES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
JOHN HEILEMANN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT B
