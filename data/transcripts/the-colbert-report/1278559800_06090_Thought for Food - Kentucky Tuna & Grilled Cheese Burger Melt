NATION, SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT
AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND
US, BUT I SAY OUR GIANT BEHINDS
ARE BEHIND US.
BECAUSE A RECENT STUDY SHOWED
THAT OUR THINNEST STATE IN 2010
IS FATTER THAN OUR FATTEST STATE
WAS IN 1991.
THAT PROVES AMERICANS ARE ALWAYS
REACHING FOR THE STARS IN OUR
BOXES OF LUCKY CHARMS.
MMM, MMM, OH, I LOOK THE LITTLE
MOONS, TOO.
THIS IS "THOUGHT FOR FOOD."
NATION, LAST SUNDAY WAS THE
FOURTH OF JULY, AND I
CELEBRATED, AS I ALWAYS, DO BY
HEADING TO CONEY ISLAND FOR THE
ANNUAL NATHAN'S FAMOUS HOT DOG
EATING CONTEST.
IT IS THE MOST PATRIOTIC
OBSERVANCE OF THE FOURTH OF JULY
SHORT OF A HOT DOG SHOOTING
CONTEST.
AND THIS YEAR WITH 54 HOT DOGS
CONSUMED IN TEN MINUTES, THE
CROWN WAS ONCE AGAIN TAKEN BY
AMERICA'S CHOW-DOWN CHAMP JOEY
CHESTNUT.
CHEW-S-A.
CHEW-S-A.
CHEW-S-A!
BUT WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A
MOMENT OF SELL -- CELEBRATORY
VOMITING WAS RUINED WHEN RIVAL
AND SIX-TIME CHAMPION TAKERU
KOBAYASHI STORMED THE STAGE
BEFORE BEING ARRESTED BY NEW
YORK POLICE.
TAKERU, HOW DARE YOU TAINT THIS
CONTEST.
AND WHY DID THIS JAPANESE
KAMIKAZE LAUNCH THIS SURPRISE
ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR?
HE WAS MAD.
MacYOU.
[LAUGHTER]
HE WAS MAD THAT HE COULDN'T
COMPETE BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO
SIGN AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT WITH
MAJOR LEAGUE EATING, WHICH WOULD
HAVE KEPT HIM FROM COMPETING IN
OTHER LEAGUES.
THAT'S RIGHT, NATION.
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE
COMPETITIVE EATING LEAGUE.
IT'S LIKE BOXING.
EACH LEAGUE HAS ITS OWN
CHAMPIONSHIP BELT, WHICH IS
PRESUMABLY ELASTIC.
[LAUGHTER]
AND BY PULLING THIS LITTLE
STUNT, KOBAYASHI HAS THROWN
CHESTNUT'S VICTORY INTO
QUESTION.
NOW WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN
ASTERISK, OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST A
KETCHUP STAIN.
NEXT UP, THE FISHING STOCKS OF
KENTUCKY ARE THREATENED BY AN
INVASIVE SPECIES, THE ASIAN
CARP.
I ASSUME THEY'RE LIKE REGULAR
CARP BUT BETTER AT SCIENCE AND
MATH.
THE ASIAN CARP WIPES OUT NATIVE
SPECIES AND ITS BAD REPUTATION
MEANS FISHMEMBER JUST CANNOT
SELL IT.
BUT NOW RESEARCHERS AT KENTUCKY
STATE UNIVERSITY SAY THEY FOUND
A SOLUTION TO THE CARP
PROBLEM -- RENAMING IT KENTUCKY
TUNA.
BRAVO, RESEARCHERS.
WHEN NATURE GIVES YOU CARP, MAKE
CARP-AID.
LEGAL DISCLAIMER, DO NOT MAKE
CARP-AID.
KENTUCKY TUNA IS, I THINK, A
BRILLIANT NAME.
IF I SEE ASIAN CARP ON A MENU, I
THINK DISGUSTING PESTS.
BUT WHEN I SEE KENTUCKY TUNA, I
THINK ALL THE SPHUSCATION OF
SUSHI RAISED IN AN ABOVE-GROUND
POOL.
RENAMING FOOD IS A GATE WAY TO
INCREASE THEIR ACCEPTANCE.
I REMEMBER WHEN I WOULDN'T EAT
MY CAULIFLOWER.
MY MOM TOLD ME, "SON, THAT'S NOT
CAULIFLOWER, THAT'S ALBINO
BROCCOLI."
AND I ATE IT ALL BECAUSE I HATE
ALBINOS.
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID.
[LAUGHTER]
WE NEED TO EXTEND THIS PRACTICE
TO ALL THE PESTS WE CURRENTLY
DON'T EAT.
COCKROACHES?
NOW THEY'RE DELICIOUS SINK
LOBSTER.
AND SAY GOOD-BYE THE SEWER RATS
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO START
DINING ON STREET VEAL.
SO YOU WANT THE TRY THE DELICACY
THAT STARTED IT ALL.
HEAD ON DOWN TO KENTUCKY, OR AS
I NOW CALL IT, "LAND HAWAII."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GIVE IT UP.
FINALLY, FOLKS, JUST WHEN I
THOUGHT THE FAST FOOD WIZARDS
COULDN'T STOP THE ARTERY-BUSTING
MAJESTY OF THE K.F.C. DOUBLE
DOWN, BACON AND CHEESE NESTLED
BETWEEN TWO FRIED CHICKEN
FILLET, THAT SUMMIT MOUNT MUNCH
MORE.
JIM?
>> THE GRILLED CHEESEBURGER
MELT, A BURGER WITH ALL THE
TRIMMINGS WEDGED BETWEEN TWO
GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES.
>> Stephen: YES, YES.
YOU'RE NOT DREAMING.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S LIKE YOUR LUNCH AND TWO
OTHER PEOPLE'S LUNCHES ARE
HAVING A THREE-WAY IN YOUR
MOUTH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS TECHNOLOGY OPENS UP SO MANY
NEW POSSIBILITIES.
WHAT IF YOU HAD A GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICH WHERE THE BREAD WAS TOO
OTHER GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH,
AND THEN, AND THEN, WHAT IF
THOSE TWO GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICHES ALSO HAD GRILLED
CHEESE SANDWICHES FOR BREAD?
AND SO ON IN AN ENDLESSLY
RECURSIVE SERIES OF DUAL STATE
CHEESE SANDWICH BREAD CHEESE
SANDWICHES, EXTENDING INTO
INFINITY.
PREPARE YOURSELF, NATION, FOR I
HAVE INVENTED THE MOBIUS MELT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO STOP EATING
IT.
AND IN THEORY, YOU NEVER COULD.
IT LOOKS EVEN MORE DELICIOUS
THAN MY PREVIOUS FAVORITE
SANDWICH, THE MAND L BLT CELT.
THE MORE YOU ZOOM IN, THE MORE
BACON THERE IS.
WHAT WILL EXPLODE FIRST?
YOUR HE
