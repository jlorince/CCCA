(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA!
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FORBEING HERE.
IT'S VERY EXCITING.
YOU AND I DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYETO EYE ON THINGS --
>> I'M GLAD ABOUT THAT, BY THEWAY.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE GLAD WE DON'TSEE EYE TO EYE?
YES, I WOULD BE WORRIED IF I SAWEYE TO EYE WITH YOU.
>> Stephen: I WOULD LIKE TOLOOK IN YOUR EYES BUT I'M ONLY
ABOUT 5'10 AND A HALF.
IT'S EXCITING TO SAY THE WORDSPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
DO YOU STILL GET EXCITED OR HAVEYOU EVER BEEN EXCITED WHEN
YOU HEAR THE WORDS PRESIDENTBARACK OBAMA?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THEJOB?
>> I LOVE THE JOB.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE,
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, YOU'RENOT THINKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS
OF TITLES, YOU'RE THINKING ABOUTHOW DO YOU DELIVER FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND ALSO WHEN IGO HOME, MICHELLE, MALIA, SASHA
GIVE ME A HARD TIME AND THEREARE NO TRUMPETS AND THEY TEASE
ME MERCILESSLY FOR MY BIG EARSOR MY STODGY SUITS --
>> Stephen: DO YOU DO NORMALTHINGS LIKE LEAVE YOUR SOCKS ON
THE FLOOR AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES THAT GOOVER?
>> NOT WELL.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YOU HAVE THE
NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES, RIGHT?
>> YES, I DO.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TOASK FOR THEM.
>> GOOD.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU TELL ME IFTHERE'S A 5 IN THERE?
(LAUGHTER)>> NO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALLRIGHT.
SPEAKING OF TRUSTING PEOPLE WITHEXTRAORDINARY POWER...
(LAUGHTER)I WANT TO GO BACK ONE SECOND TO
2008.
PART OF YOUR CAMPAIGN WASBELIEVING THAT THE PRESIDENT AT
THE TIME HAD INVESTED THEEXECUTIVE WITH TOO MUCH POWER.
THEN YOU BECAME PRESIDENT, ANDYOU SEEMED TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT
OF POWER.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: DOES THAT HAPPENTO EVERY PRESIDENT, WHERE YOU
GET INTO THE OFFICE AND YOUTHINK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I MIGHT BE THE ONLY ONE I TRUSTWITH THIS MUCH POWER, SO I'LL
HOLD ON TO IT?
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
YOU'RE ASKING A SENSIBLEQUESTION.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT IS TRUE --
(LAUGHTER)-- THE STRUCTURE OF OUR
DEMOCRACY IS CHECKS ANDBALANCES, AND EVERY PRESIDENT,
EVEN IF ON THE OUTSIDE THEY WERECOMPLAINING, THERE'S ALWAYS THE
TEMPTATION TO WANT TO GO AHEADAND GET STUFF DONE AND DEMOCRACY
IS MESSY AND COMPLICATED.
SO THE TENDENCY IS TO SAY, WELL,LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THIS
DONE, JUST BECAUSE THINGS ARE SOBOTTLED UP, ESPECIALLY AT A
MOMENT WHEN THERE'S A LOT OFGRIDLOCK.
WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS TO MAKESURE THAT THE OFFICE OF LEGAL
COUNCIL WHICH WEIGHS IN ON WHATWE CAN AND CANNOT DO IS FIERCELY
INDEPENDENT.
THEY MAKE DECISIONS.
WE WORK WELL WITHIN THE LINES OFTHAT.
BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TOGET A WHOLE LOT MORE DONE
THROUGH CONGRESS, WHICH IS WHY,FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE IMMIGRATION
LEGISLATION, WHAT I SAID TO THEMIS, IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HOW
WE'RE APPROACHING THIS EXECUTIVEACTION, THERE IS AN EASY
SOLUTION, PASS A BILL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IF YOU PASS A BILL, THEN WE'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THINGSDONE.
YOU KNOW, TOO OFTEN WHAT WE HAVEIS A CONGRESS THAT IS STUCK, AND
THEN THE EXECUTIVE AND/OR THECOURTS END UP FILLING THE GAPS.
AND I THINK THAT THE MORE WE CANGET CONGRESS TO ACTUALLY WORK
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO, THELESS THESE PROBLEMS COME UP.
>> Stephen: LAST QUESTION,SIR.
>> YES, GO AHEAD.
>> Stephen: BARACK OBAMA,GREAT PRESIDENT, OR THE GREATEST
PRESIDENT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> I'LL LEAVE THAT ONE ALONE,
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: PRESIDENT BARACKOBAMA, WHAT AN HONOR
TO HAVE YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BARACK OBAMA, EVERYBODY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, SIR.
