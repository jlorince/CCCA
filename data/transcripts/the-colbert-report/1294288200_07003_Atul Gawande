EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
BOOK ABOUT THE POWER OF LISTS.
IT WORKS FOR SANTA.
PLEASE WELCOME DR. ATUL GAWANDE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
DR. GAWANDE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
>> GLAD TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR.
YOU HAVE A BOOK OUT IN PAPERBACK
NOW.
IT'S CALLED THE CHECKLIST
MANIFESTO.
HOW TO GET THINGS RIGHT.
HOW DOES... ISN'T A CHECKLIST
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO
DO THINGS RIGHT?
IT'S LIKE A RECIPE BOOK.
>> EXACTLY.
PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT THAT
CHECKLISTS WERE ONLY ABOUT THE
LOWEST PEOPLE ON THE TOTEM POLE,
BUT IN A WORLD WHERE WE ARE
FACED WITH ENORMOUS COMPLEXITY,
WE ASK ORDINARY PEOPLE TO DO
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, FLY
AIRPLANE, BUILD SKYSCRAPERS, DO
OPERATIONS.
>> Stephen: HOST A SHOW.
>> HOST A SHOW.
>> Stephen: SAID IT COULDN'T
BE DONE.
>> WE ARE FAILING BECAUSE OF
INABILITY TO MEET THE BASICS.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE WE
FAILING?
WE'RE AMERICA, SIR.
AMERICANS DON'T NEED CHECKLISTS.
WE FREE BALL IT.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
CHECK ONE, SHOW UP TO WORK.
TWO, BE AMERICAN.
OKAY.
GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD.
YOU'RE A DOCTOR, RIGHT?
YOU'RE A SURGEON.
YOU CUT INTO PEOPLE, RIGHT?
DO YOU USE CHECKLISTS?
WOULD YOU USE A CHECK LIST?
>> I BEGAN USING A CHECKLIST IN
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH THE CHECKLIST?
>> WE WORKED WITH BOEING.
>> Stephen: YOU WORKED WITH
BOEING?
WHY IS THAT NECESSARY, WHY
BOEING?
>> BECAUSE THEY MAKE OVER 100
CHECK LISTS A YEAR TO DEAL WITH
CRASHING AIRPLANES AND HOW TO
MAKE THEM WORK.
>> Stephen: HIT GROUND.
>> RIGHT.
YES.
OKAY, FAILING AIRPLANES.
>> Stephen: FAILING AIRPLANES.
>> AND SO WE WORK WITH THEM AND
MAY SHOW US HOW THE MAKE IT WITH
WE COULD USE IT IN CRISIS
SITUATIONS.
WE MADE A TWO-LIST CHECKLIST.
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
KNOWS EACH OTHER'S NAME.
>> Stephen: SOMEBODY WOULD
JUST SNEAK INTO SURGERY, BECAUSE
THEY WANT THE TAKE A COUPLE
STAB, SEE HOW IT FEELS?
>> THE BACKLASH TOE EVEN THE
IDEAS IS OF COURSE WE DO THAT.
WE PUT THE CHECK WILLIST IN.
IN EVERY HOSPITAL WE PUT IT IN,
IT REDUCED COMPLICATIONS AND
DEATHS.
ON AVERAGE BY MORE THAN
ONE-THIRD.
18 COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED IT,
INCLUDING THE NEATHERLANDS WHERE
THEY PUBLISHED THEIR DEATH RATE
WENT DOWN 50%.
>> Stephen: IN THE NEW
NEATHERLANDS, NUMBER ONE IS PUT
OUT YOUR JOINT.
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT A SURGEON
APPROACHING SURGERY THE WAY I
APPROACH LOVE MAKING.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A RIGHT HERE,
BY THE WAY.
IS IT JUST FOR... HAVE YOU MOVED
THIS INTO OTHER FIELDS?
>> IN FACT, IT HAS COME FROM
OTHER FIELDS.
IT STARTED WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA
OF AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST AT JOB
JOHNS HOPKINS WHO BROUGHT
CHECKLISTS INTO INTENSIVE CARE
UNITS, DID YOU WASH YOUR HAND,
DID YOU PUT ON GOVERNORS AND HAT
AND MASK AND A STERILE GOWN
BEFORE YOU TRY TO PUT A CENTRAL
LINE IN A PATIENT?
IT REDUCES INFECTIONS IN THE
STATE OF MICHIGAN BY TWO-THIRDS.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THIS GOING
TO MAKE EVERYBODY ABLE ALL THE
TIME.
IF WE NEVER MAKE MISTAKES, WE
CAN NEVER LEARN FROM OUR
MISTAKES, CORRECT?
IT IS NOT CORRECT?
SO YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO
LEARN.
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO LEARN
FROM THEIR MISTAKES.
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE TEACHER.
( LAUGHTER )
DON'T YOU AGREE?
THERE'S LEARNING... DO YOU AGREE
YOU LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.
>> YOU LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HOLD ON.
I WANT THE CHECK OFF THIS I
NAILED YOU.
GOT YOU RIGHT THERE.
IS THERE ANY PLAYING THIS
DOESN'T APPLY?
WHAT ABOUT THE ARTS.
AN ARTIST HAS TO BE SPONTANEOUS
AND FREE WHEELING AND LET THE
MUSIC MOVE HIM OR HER.
WOULD YOU APPLY THIS TO THAT?
>> I TELL THE STORY OF DAVID LEE
ROTH.
VAN HALEN.
>> Stephen: I TELL SOME
STORIES WITH DAVID LEE ROTH,
TOO, BY THE WAY.
>> VAN HALEN WOULD HAVE A
CONNIPTION FIT IF YOU HAD BROWN
M&Ms IN A BOWL IN THE DRESSING
ROOM.
THE REAL STORY BEHIND IT IS
DAVID LEE ROTH WOULD... THE
WHOLE BAND WOULD BRING THEIR
WHOLE STAGE SHOW INTO LITTLE
TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA THAT NEVER
HAD THIS THREE-TIER STAGE SET ON
THEIR BASKETBALL ARENA AND HAD A
CHECKLIST.
ON THE MIDDLE OF THE CHECK LIST,
NO BROWN M&Ms IN THE DRESSING
ROOM, AND IF THEY DIDN'T RUN
THROUGH THE CHECKLIST, THEN THE
STAGE WOULD FALL APART AND KILL
SOMEBODY SOME THEY WOULD WALK
INTO THE DRESSING ROOM, SEE
BROWN M&Ms, THEY KNOW THE SHOW
COULDN'T GO.
THEY CANCELED THE SHOW.
THAT WAS THE CHECK LIST.
>> Stephen: NOT BECAUSE THEY
WERE COMPLETE PRIMA DONNAS BUT
BECAUSE THEY USED THE CHECK LIST
AS SOME SORT OF CANARY IN A COAL
MINE TO SEE WHETHER SOMEBODY WAS
PAYING ATTENTION.
>> THEN THE BEAUTY IS YOU COULD
THEN BE A COMPLETE PRIMA DONNA,
THROW THINGS AROUND, GET IN THE
PAPERS WHEN IN REALITY HE WAS
BEING EXTREMELY CAREFUL.
>> Stephen: AND HOW LONG DID
YOU THINK IT TOOK HIM TO COME UP
WITH THIS RASH NAL -- RATIONAL?
WHAT'S NEXT?
IS THERE ANY PLACE LEFT WHERE
KIDS AREN'T?
>> I THINK WE NEED TO TEACH KIDS
TO MAKE CHECKLISTS AND HOW TO
HANDLE COMPLEXITY DURING
ORDINARY LIFE.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A TERRIBLE
PERSON.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE CHILDREN
ANAL?
( LAUGHTER )
>> WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY
HAVE TO GROW UP AND DEAL WITH,
IT IS TO BE THE KIND OF PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD WHO CAN MANAGE
EVERYTHING FROM SURGERY THE
FLYING PLANES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT NEXT TIME IN SURGERY I LOOK
UP AND I SEE A KID, I'M GOING TO
BE MAD AT YOU.
DR. GAWANDE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ATUL GAWANDE.
THE BOOK IS "THE CHECK WILL
MANIFESTO."
