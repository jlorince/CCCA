[LAUGHTER]
NATION, TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA
SIGNED THE DEBT CEILING
COMPROMISE.
AND AMERICA NARROWLY AVOIDED A
CATASTROPHE:
GIVING THE DEMOCRATS ANYTHING
THEY WANT.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THIS BILL
WAS TWO-SIDED WAS THAT THE DEMS
HAD TO TAKE IT AT BOTH ENDS.
[LAUGHTER]
GOT THAT IMAGE IN THE OLD MIND,
DON'T YOU?
GOT THAT IMAGE RIGHT UP HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST LOOK HOW THIS DEFEAT HAS
BROKEN HARRY REID.
>> I HAVE A HOME IN NEVADA THAT
I HAVEN'T SEEN IN MONTHS,  MY
POMEGRANATE TREES ARE, I'M TOLD,
BLOSSOMING AND HAVE SOME
POMEGRANATES ON THEM.
I HAVE SOME FIG TREES AND ROSES
AND THINGS THAT I JUST HAVEN'T
SEEN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD.
HOW'S OBAMA GONNA TELL HARRY
REID THAT HE ALSO GAVE THE
REPUBLICANS ALL HIS POMEGRANATE
TREES?
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NOW THAT IT'S DONE, ALL
AMERICANS ARE BREATHING A SIGH
OF RELIEF BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE
BEEN A PAINFUL PROCESS, BUT AT
LEAST THE ECONOMY IS SAVED!
>> THE DOW TODAY DOWN 265 POINTS
ON THE DAY.
>> Stephen:yM WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GIVE THE REPUBLICANS ONLY 98%
OF WHAT THEY WANT.
SEE, THE MARKET WAS AFRAID THAT
EVEN WITH A DEAL, AMERICA'S
CREDIT RATING WAS GOING TO GET
DOWNGRADED BY AGENCIES LIKE
MOODY'S AND STANDARD & POOR'S.
AMERICA IS CURRENTLY RATED
TRIPLE-A, WHICH MEANS WE'RE A
VERY SAFE INVESTMENT.
PLUS, I BELIEVE WE GET
FREE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND
DISCOUNTS AT PARTICIPATING
HYATTS.
[LAUGHTER]
COUNTRIES LESS LIKELY TO PAY
BACK THEIR DEBT HAVE LOWER
GRADES.
FOR EXAMPLE, GREECE NOW HAS SUCH
A LOW GRADE, IT MAY BE HELD BACK
AND FORCED TO REPEAT THE LAST
3000 YEARS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND LOWERING AMERICA'S GRADE IS
BAD NEWS:
>> INTEREST RATES COULD RISE,
AND THAT COULD MEAN THAT YOU PAY
MORE FOR YOUR MORTGAGE--
>> THE COST OF BUYING A CAR
COULD RISE.
>> CREDIT CARD RATES RISE AS
WELL.
>> IF THE US LOSES THAT AAA
STATUS, IT WILL BE MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT FOR THE US TO RESTORE
GROWTH. SO IT'S UNAMBIGUOUSLY
BAD.
>> Stephen: SO THESE UNELECTED
ELITES GET TO WAVE THEIR WALL
STREET WAND AND TANK THE
ECONOMY?
WHY?
THEY'RE NOT SPECIAL AND RICH.
THEY'RE STANDARD AND POOR!
[LAUGHTER]
NO WONDER THEY'RE SO MOODY!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I'LL TAKE THAT ONE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THEY ARE MATERIALLY HARMING
AMERICA.
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN
ECONOMIC TERRORISM.
AND I SAY WE DEAL WITH THEM THE
WAY WE DEAL WITH ALL TERRORISTS.
MARCH MARINES TO THEIR OFFICES,
FIT THEM FOR ORANGE JUMPSUITS,
AND WHISK THEM OFF TO GITMO FOR
SOME ENHANCED ACCOUNTING.
[LAUGHTER]
A LITTLE NUMBER BOARDING.
ROUGH STUFF, BUT IT'S THE ONLY
