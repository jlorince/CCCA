>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THEREPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> THANK YOU, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS-- FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU,I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT
OFTEN THAT AN AUDIENCE LOVES MESO MUCH I CAN HEAR IT WITH MY
DEAF EAR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NATION, I-- I GOTTA TELL YOU,FOLKS, I AM FURIOUS AT BARACK
OBAMA.
( LAUGHTER )AND I AM VICE-FURIOUS AT JOE
BIDEN.
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY, ANOTHERFEDERAL AGENCY REVEALS THEIR
LACK OF LEADERSHIP.
CASE IN POINT-- THE BUREAU OFENGRAVING AND PRINTING HAS JUST
PRODUCED A PORTRAIT OF CHIEFJUSTICE ROBERTS THAT IN NO WAY
CAPTURES THE ELFIN TWINKLE INHIS EYES.
( LAUGHTER )THIS KIND OF WORK, AND I'M
SUPPOSED TO SPEND THE MONEYTHESE PEOPLE PRINT?
NO THANKS.
AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT THEDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
IS LOUSY AT HELPING VETERANS ORTHEIR AFFAIRS.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> STUNNING NEW REVELATIONS INTHE SCANDAL ROCKING THE VETERANS
AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT.
>> A CNN INVESTIGATION FOUND 40VETERANS DIED AT THE PHOENIX
V.A. WHILE AWAITING TREATMENT.
>> THERE WAS A SECRET HIDDENLIST, HIDING THE FACT THAT
VETERANS WERE WAITING UP TO21 MONTHS TO SEE A DOCTOR.
>> Stephen:  YES, A SECRETLIST TO SEE A DOCTOR-- THOUGH
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TIPPED OFFBY THE BOUNCERS OUTSIDE THE O.R.
( LAUGHTER )THERE ARE NOW SIMILAR CLAIMS IN
12 STATES, AND THE AMERICANLEGION HAS CALLED FOR THE
SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS,ERIC SHINSEKI, TO RESIGN.
SO FAR HE HAS REFUSED, PROBABLYBECAUSE HE KNOWS ONCE HE
RETIRES, HE'LL HAVE TO USEHEALTH CARE FROM THE V.A
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
WORST OF ALL, FOR YEARS, THEPRESIDENT CLAIMED HE WOULD FIX
THIS.
>> WHEN A VETERAN IS DENIEDCARE, WE'RE ALL DISHONORED.
THE SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN WHOEMBODY WHAT'S BEST ABOUT AMERICA
SHOULD GET THE BEST CARE WE HAVETO OFFER, AND THAT IS WHAT I
WILL PROVIDE WHEN I AMPRESIDENT.
LET'S KEEP TAKING CARE OF OUREXTRAORDINARY MILITARY FAMILIES.
THIS LEADS ME TO ANOTHER PROMISEI MADE FOUR YEARS AGO--
UPHOLDING AMERICA'S SACRED TRUSTWITH OUR VETERANS.
I PROMISE TO STRENGTHEN THEV.A., AND THAT PROMISE HAS BEEN
KEPT.
>> Stephen:  YES, THAT PROMISEHAS BEEN KEPT, BUT HE'S
EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN WHERE HE'SKEEPING IT.
( LAUGHTER )MAYBE THEY SHOULD CHECK THE SHOE
BOX IN THE BACK OF THE WHITEHOUSE CLOSET LABELED "TO DO."
( LAUGHTER )NOW, GET THIS, THE OBAMA PEOPLE
NOW SAY THE PRESIDENT FIRSTLEARNED OF THESE NEW
ALLEGATIONS FROM CNN.
HE HAD NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ONIN HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION.
HERE'S AN IDEA-- GET THE N.S.A.
TO START SPYING ON WOLF BLITZER.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
FAIR WARNING, GUYS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FAIR WARNING!
FAIR WARNING, N.S.A.-- BRINGSOME NO-DOZ.
( LAUGHTER )THE ONLY OTHER WAY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE KNOWNABOUT THIS IS WHEN THE THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION TOLD THEM ABOUTIT.
>> THIS MEMO, PREPARED FORPRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA'S
TRANSITION TEAM BY THE GEORGE W.
BUSH ADMINISTRATION, OUTLINEDTHE DIFFICULTIES VETERANS FACED
IN OBTAINING TIMELY HEALTH CARE.
IT URGED THE VETERANSADMINISTRATION TO PROPERLY
DOCUMENT DESIRED APPOINTMENTDATES AND ENSURE PATIENT WAITING
TIMES ARE ACCURATE.
FAILURE TO DO SO, THE MEMOWARNED, WOULD AFFECT QUALITY OF
CARE BY DELAYING AND POTENTIALLYDENYING DESERVING VETERANS
TIMELY CARE.
>> Stephen:  THERE WAS A MEMO.
IT WARNED THEM.
BUSH EVEN PERSONALIZED IT--P.S.:  V.A. TOTALLY EFF'D UP.
SEE YA.
WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YA.
SMILEY FACE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS, THESE VETERANS ARESUFFERING UNDER OBAMA'S WATCH,
AFTER HE DECLARED THEM A TOPPRIORITY, AND HIS TEAM HAD BEEN
ALERTED TO MISCONDUCT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
IT MEANS WE FINALLY HAVE A REALSCANDAL.
A REAL SCANDAL!
JIMMY DROP THEM!
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
♪  ♪FOLKS, I HAVE WAITED SO LONG.
( LAUGHTER )I KNOW I'VE CRIED WOLF BEFORE
WHAT WITH BENGHAZI AND THEI.R.S. AND THE A.P., AND FAST
AND FURIOUS, AND SOLYNDRA ANDOBAMA'S UNCLE, AND OBAMA'S AUNT,
AND OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
I EVEN-- I EVEN CRIED WOLF ABOUTTHE SECRET WHITE HOUSE WOLF.
BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT.
IT'S BACKED UP BY EYEWITNESSESAND DOCUMENTS AND THE BETRAYAL
OF SICK VETERANS.
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING.
( LAUGHTER )AND THAT'S WHY I CANNOT BELIEVE
I AM GOING TO SAY THAT WE CANNOTTALK ABOUT THIS SCANDAL.
YOU SEE, WE AMERICANS MADE ADEAL WITH THE VETERANS.
WE START TWO WARS.
THEY LAY THEIR LIVES ON THE LINEWHILE WE LAY ON OUR ASSES ON THE
COUCH WATCHING "THE BACHELOR."
( APPLAUSE )I STILL HAVE FLASHBACKS WHENEVER
I HEAR THE WORDS, "JUAN PABLO."
IN RETURN WE SAY THANK YOU FORYOUR SERVICE.
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.
YES, TICKER TAPE PARADE WOULDHAVE BEEN BUT IN OUR PAPERLESS
SOCIETY WE WOULD PROBABLY JUSTTHROW THE iPADS OUT THE WINDOW
AND SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT.
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD, BECAUSE IHEAR V.A. HEALTH CARE IS PRETTY
BAD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND IF WE TALK ABOUT THE V.A.
SCANDAL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TOTALK ABOUT NEXT, THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN?
I JUST FOUND OUT WE'VE GOT OVER30,000 TROOPS STILL OVER THERE.
COST ME 40 BUCKS AT MY BAR'STRIVIA NIGHT.
