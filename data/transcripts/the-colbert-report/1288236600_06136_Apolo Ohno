EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN
EIGHT-TIME OLYMPIC MEDALIST
SPEED SKATER WHO HAS WRITTEN A
NEW MEMOIR CALLED "ZERO
REGRETS," AND THAT IS COMING
FROM A GUY WHO WEARS A SPANDEX
UNITARD.
PLEASE WELCOME APOLO OHNO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: SIT DOWN.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> MY PLEASURE.
MY ABSOLUTELY PLEASURE.
I'M A BIG FAN.
>> Stephen: I'M A BIG FAN.
>> OF YOU.
OF ME?
>> Stephen: MOSTLY ME, BUT
YOU, TOO.
YOU HAVE A NEW MEMOIR CALLED
"ZERO REGRETS: BE GREATER THAN
YESTERDAY."
HOW COULD YOU BE GREATER THAN
YESTERDAY?
YOU ARE THE ALL-TIME WINTER
OLYMPIC DECORATED CHAMPION.
YOU SAY THERE'S BETTER THINGS
AHEAD FOR APOLO OHNO?
>> THERE'S ALWAYS BETTER THINGS
AHEAD.
THE REASON I CHOSE "ZERO
REGRETS" IS NOT BECAUSE I'VE HAD
ZERO REGRETS IN MY LIFE.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE
TO HAVE SOME REGETS.
YOU BOUGHT A PAIR OF ACID WASHED
JEANS OR YOU WENT TO "THE LAST
AIR BENDER."
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
INTERESTING MOVIES.
MY PURSUIT OF "ZERO REGRETS," MY
ENTIRE PASSION, PHILOSOPHY
TOWARDS THE SPORT AND THINGS I
BELIEVE NEW YORK ESPECIALLY
PREPARATION FOR THESE PAST GAME,
I WANTED NOTHING LEFT TO TRANS.
I TRAINED FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE
FOR CHANCE FOR 40 SECONDS ON THE
ICE.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> KIND OF CRAZY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE ALL THOSE
FOUR YEARS COULD HAVE BEEN FOR
NAWGHTD.
>> NO GUARANTEES.
>> Stephen: THERE'S YOUR LIFE.
OVER.
>> FROM A CAREER STANDPOINT.
IT'S PRETTY WILD.
I NEEDED A CONCEPT THAT SAYS, IF
I'M GOING TO PREPARE MY ENTIRE
LIFE FOR SOMETHING SO STRONG AND
SO IMPORTANT TO ME, I NEED TO
MAKE SURE IT'S WORTH IT, PLUS
LIKE YOU SAID, I'M IN A SPORT
WHERE I HAVE A WARROR'S
MENTALITY.
EVERYTHING I DO...
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A
WARRIORS MENTALITY AND YOU HAVE
SWORDS ON YOUR FEET.
>> YEAH, I KNOW, AND...
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TEMPTED TO TAKE ONE OFF AND
GO --
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF IRONIC
THE FACT THAT I HAVE THIS
WARRIOR'S MENTALITY.
I RACE AROUND THIS RINK 359,
40mph, AND I THINK I'M
TRAINING LIKE A BOXER OR A
FIGHTER, BUT I'M STILL WEARING
TIGHTS GOING IN CIRCLES.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN ONLY TAKE
YOURSELF SO SERIOUSLY.
>> SO THAT'S WHY PEOPLE SAY,
APOLO, WEREN'T YOU MAD ABOUT
THAT LAST RACE?
>> YEAH, BUT LIFE IS MUCH BIGGER
THAN JUST A SPORT.
THE THING THE SPORT HAS TAUGHT
ME ARE AMAZING.
>> Stephen: EIGHT MEDALS
TOTAL.
>> EIGHT.
>> Stephen: THE MOST DECORATED
WINTER OLYMPIAN OF ALL TIME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOW MANY MORE?
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY MORE
MEDALS DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
HAVE GOTTEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE WIND RESISTANCE OF THE SOUL
PATCH RIGHT HERE?
DO YOU EVER REGRET THAT?
NO REGRETS ABOUT THAT EITHER?
>> THIS IS A TRUE STORY.
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.
I'M HALF JAPANESE.
MY FATHER IS FULL JAPANESE.
HE CAN GROW A FULL BEARD.
I CAN ONLY GROW HALF BEARD, I
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE I'M
HALF JAPANESE, BUT MY HAIR
LITERALLY ONLY GREW RIGHT HERE.
AND THIS WHOLE THING WAS LIKE A
SOUL PATCH, A GOATEE.
THIS IS WHAT I'M WORKING.
WITH I HAVE NO CHOICE.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO GO
WITH WHAT YOU CAN DO.
>> I'M WORKING WITH WHAT I HAVE.
>> Stephen: NOW, ARE THERE
THINGS THAT YOU LEARN OUT HERE
THAT CAN APPLY TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
LIVES?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: AND DO YOU HAVE TO
BE IN THE LIKE A?
>> I PREFER WEARING SPANDEX.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SEE ME ON
THE COVER?
>> YOUR PHYSIQUE WAS INCREDIBLE.
>> Stephen: INCREDIBLE IS THE
WORD I WOULD USE, TOO, I GIVE IT
NO CREDIT.
ARE YOU GOING TO SKATE AGAIN IN
2014?
>> WE'LL SEE.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD SKATE IN
2012 IN LONDON YOU'RE THAT GOOD.
GET THOSE SKATES ON AND RUN DOWN
THE TRACK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT 2014?
>> I THINK RUSSIA WILL BE A
SPECTACULAR GAMES.
I'M TAKING A BREAK AND FOCUSING
ON THINGS I WANTED TO FOCUS ON
OUTSIDE OF THE SPORT.
THE BOOK IS VERY DEAR TO ME.
I WANT IT TO BE VERY
INSPIRATIONAL.
IT CAN BE APPLICABLE TOWARDS ANY
WALK OF LIFE.
I THINK PEOPLE CAN TAKE
INSPIRATION, RELATE TO THE
STORIES I HAVE.
YOU KNOW, MY CHILDHOOD
UPBRINGING, SOMETHING THAT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT THE SKATING BUT JUST
ABOUT SELF-BATTLES AND WORKING
AGAINST AND ALWAYS BATTLING
AGAINST THE SELF-DOUBT AND
INSECURITIES AND LEARN TO BECOME
A CHAMPION IN THE END.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SELF-DOUBT OR INSECURITY MEANS,
BUT THANK YOU.
APOLO OHNO, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
THE BOOK
