FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYSARE PAYING ATTENTION, I
KNOW THE COLBERT NATIONALWAYS DOES, IT IS
ABSOLUTELY NO BIG SECRETTHAT OUR COUNTRY IS BEING
TORN APART BY CHILDISHPARTISAN BICKERING AND OBAMA
STARTED IT.
WE'RE A CULTURE WAR, FOLKS,IT'S US VERSUS THEM.
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHOTHEM ARE, YOU COULD BE THEY.
AND IT'S NOT JUST POLITICS,WE ALSO MUST PICK SIDES IN
THE PRODUCTS WE BUY.
THAT'S WHY I PATRONIZE ONLYCONSERVATIVE BUSINESSES,
SAM'S CLUB INSED OF COSTCO,CHIK-FIL-A INSTEAD OF CHIPOTLE.
HOBBY LOBBY INSTEAD OF WHATEVERTHE PRO CONTRACEPTIVE CRAFT
SUPERSTORE IS, I'M GUESSINGSLUTS 'N STUFF.
UNFORTUNATELY -- IT'S GOOD, IT'SA GOOD BUSINESS.
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT EVERYCOMPANY JUST ADVERTISES
WHICH SIDE THEY'RE ON.
WELL, GOOD NEWS.
AS THE KIDS SAY, THERE'S ANiPHONE APPLICATION PROGRAM
TO DO THAT.
>> BIPARTISAN, THAT'S BUY,AN APP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO
SCAN THE BAR CODE OF YOURFAVORITE GROCERY ITEM
AND FIND OUT JUST HOW MUCH MONEYTHE COMPANY AND ITS C.E.O.
GIVE TO EITHER PARTY.
CHERRIOS GAVE 63.5% OF ITSPOLITICAL DONATIONS TO
REPUBLICANS.
AND 24% TO DEMOCRATS.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE CHEERIOSLEANS REPUBLICAN.
THEY'RE STRONG ON NATIONALDEFENSE AND CHEERIOS ARE
MADE BY A GENERAL.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE,AND YOUR FIBER, SIR.

THIS NUTRIGRAIN BAR.

IT SAYS HERE THAT IT'S MADEBY KELLOGG'S WHOSE POLITICAL
DONATIONS AVERAGE 37.25%REPUBLICAN, 33.5% DEMOCRAT
AND 29.25% OTHER.
WHICH I ASSUME IS HIGHFRUCTOSE CORN SIRRUP.
NOW LET'S TRY THE SAME THINGWITH, LET'S TRY THAT WITH
STARBUCKS COFFEE.
OKAY.
IT SAYS HERE 80.75%DEMOCRAT.
AND I'M SURE, I'M SURE-- I'MSURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 100%
BUT THEY LEFT ROOM FOR MILK.
AND I KNOW BUY-PARTISAN, THISLITTLE APP HERE IS TRUSTWORTHY
BECAUSE IT WAS DEVELOPED BYFORMER CAPITOL HILL STAFFER
MATTHEW COLBERT.
