WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS
SAID THAT BABIES ARE A MIRACLE
UNLESS THEY BELONG TO
HOMOSEXUALS, IN WHICH CASE
THEY'RE PETS.
I SAY, I SAY IF A LESBIAN WANTS
A CHILD SO BAD, SHE SHOULD HAVE
TO STEAL THE SEED OF A DRUGGED
MAIL MAN AND INSIMILAR INDICATE
HERSELF WITH A TURKEY BASTER,
LIKE GOD INTENDED.
AND RECENTLY A MAJOR SCIENTIFIC
STUDY CONFIRMED MY FEARS.
JIM.
>> A 25-YEAR LONG STUDY
INDICATES KIDS RAISED BY LESBIAN
PARENTS HAVE FEWER BEHAVIORAL
PROBLEMS AND RATE HIGHER IN
SOCIAL AND ACADEMIC COMPETENCE
THAN THEIR PEERS.
>> Stephen: YES, LESBIANS
RAISE WELL-ADJUSTED TEENS WHO
DON'T MISBEHAVE, AND THAT PROVES
IT'S UNNATURAL.
[LAUGHTER]
TEENAGERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
CRYPTIC, ANGSTY MUMBLE-MOUTHED,
NARCISSISTIC, ALIENATED,
MOOD-SWINGING HORMONE JUNKIES
WHO GO THROUGH VAMPIRE PHASES
WHO ARE MORTIFIED TO BE SEEN
WITH THEIR PARENTS EVEN WHEN YOU
TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE AWE SOME
LIKE THE GRAMMYS.
SO LESBIAN PARENTS, LEZZIN' UP.
STOP CREATING GOOD EXAMPLES FOR
OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE HISTORY WAS
SHAPED BY TROUBLED TEENAGERS,
ALSO DER THE GREAT, JOAN OF ARC,
KING TUT, THESE TEENS EXCELLED
BECAUSE THEY WERE PROPERLY
SCREWED-UP FREAKS.
[LAUGHTER]
IF THEY'D BEEN RAISED BY
LESBIAN, THEY'D HAVE BEEN
ALEXANDER THE RELATABLE, JOAN OF
ACCOUNTING AND REGIONAL MANAGER
TUT.
BUT WHAT OFFENDS ME MOST ABOUT
THIS HOT GIRL-ON-GIRL STUDY IS
THAT IT IMPLIES THAT WOMEN DON'T
NEED MEN.
I AM TELLING YOU, FELLAS,
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF US.
YOU THINK I'M OVERREACTING IN
JUST LOOK AT THE COVER OF THIS
MONTH'S "THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY."
THE END OF MEN, HOW WOMEN ARE
TAKING CONTROL OF EVERYTHING.
WRITTEN, LET'S SEE, BY A WOMAN.
OH, WHAT A SURPRISE.
OF COURSE, THE REAL SURPRISE IS
THEY PUBLISHED "THE END OF MEN"
BEFORE THE END OF MAGAZINES.
AND FOLKS, THIS ARTICLE, THIS
ARTICLE PAINTS A BLEAK PICTURE
BECAUSE APPARENTLY FOR EVERY TWO
MEN WHO WILL RECEIVE A
BACHELOR'S DEGREE THIS YEAR,
THREE WOMEN WILL DO THE SAME.
THAT MEANS WOMEN WILL BE MORE
QUALIFIED FOR ALL THE BEST JOBS
THAT DON'T EXIST.
[LAUGHTER]
FACE IT, LADIES, YOU'RE HARD TO
COMPETE WITH.
APPARENTLY WOMEN ARE BETTER
ADANCED TO TODAY'S
POST-INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY DUE TO
THEIR SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE, OPEN
COMMUNICATION AND THE ABILITY TO
SIT STILL AND FOCUS.
BULL [BLEEPED].
[APPLAUSE]
MEN CAN FOCUS.
I FOCUS LIKE A LASER BEAM.
HEY, MY PEN HAS A LITTLE BOAT ON
IT.
[LAUGHTER]
JIMMY, LET'S GET ME A GUESS OF
THESE AND I'LL HOLD A REGATTA.
RIGHT.
THIS DISCRIMINATION IS ALL GOING
TO GET WORSE, GUY, BECAUSE
DURING SEX SELECTION AT
FERTILITY CLINICS, EVIDENTLY
REQUESTS FOR A GIRL RUN ABOUT
75%.
HEY, LADY, YOU WANT A GIRL THAT
BAD, GO TO CHINA.
EVERY CHECKOUT COUNTER HAS A
"TAKE A DAUGHTER, LEAVE DAUGHTER
TRAY."
I FOR ONE AM NOT GOING TO TAKE
IT.
THAT IS WHY TONIGHT I HEREBY
BURN THE SYMBOL OF MALE
OPPRESSION, BOXERS.
GUYS, FACE IT, WE ONLY WEAR THEM
BECAUSE THE MAY TRACKY SAYS WE
NEED THEM IN CASE WE GET HIT BY
A BUS.
LET ME JUST GET THEM OFF RIGHT
HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
OF COURSE, LIKE EVERY MAN, I
KNOW HOW THE TAKE OFF MY
UNDERWEAR WITHOUT TAKING OFF MY
PANTS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M FREE BALLING IT NOW.
NOW, TO BURN THEM.
UNFORTUNATELY THE FIRE MARSHAL
SAYS I CAN'T TORCH THESE IN A
PACKED STUDIO, SO I'M GOING TO
DO NEXT BEST THING AND MICROWAVE
THEM.
JUST PUT THAT IN THERE.
SET THAT TO HANES.
I JUST WISH THERE WAS A WOMAN
HERE TO SEE IT.
HERE TO SEE IT, PLEASE WELCOME
THE AUTHOR OF THE END OF MEN
FROM THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY, HANNA
ROSIN.
HANNA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
LET ME GET THAT.
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.
COMFORTABLE?
YOU NEED A PILLOW OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT?
>> THANK YOU.
WHAT A GENTLEMAN.
>> Stephen: NOW, MADAM, LIKE A
LOT OF MEN OUT THERE, I AM
TERRIFIED BY YOUR ARTICLE.
"THE END OF MEN?"
>> YES.
>> Stephen: TRULY, TRULY, ARE
WE NEEDED ANYMORE?
>> YOU ARE NEEDED.
IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD.
>> Stephen: FOR OUR SEED?
>> YEAH, WELL, EXACTLY.
SOMEONE HAS TO STOCK THE SPERM
BANKS.
YOU'RE NEEDED.
YOU'RE NEEDED.
YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS AS A CRY
FOR HELPING WOMEN.
IT'S JUST WOMEN ARE DOING REALLY
WELL.
>> Stephen: WOMEN ARE DOING
REALLY WELL.
DO WE STILL NEED TITLE NINE?
DO WE STILL NEED AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION FOR THE LADIES?
>> IN SOME WAYS WE DO.
PART OF THIS IS JUST TO
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORKFORCE IS
BECOMING DOMINATED BY WOMEN SO
WE NEED THINGS LIKE HELP WITH
CHILDCARE AND THOSE KIND OF
THINGS.
AS LONG AS WE RECOGNIZE THIS
PHENOMENON IS HAPPENING, BUT WE
ALSO PROBABLY NEED SOME
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR MEN.
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT THIS,
WHAT ABOUT YOU HAVE TO CHILD MEN
FOR YOUR CHILDCARE?
[LAUGHTER]
WHY IS THAT LAUGHABLE?
[LAUGHTER]
WHY IS THAT LAUGHABLE?
WHY WOULD YOU NOT LEAVE YOUR
INFANT ALONE WITH AN UNEMPLOYED
MAN?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> I MIGHT, I MIGHT.
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE SOLUTION
IS TO HAVE MEN BE NANNIES AND
NURSES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS
THAT ARE... THESE ARE THE
GROWING PROFESSION, SO MEN MIGHT
AS WELL LEARN TO DO THEM.
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD
THING LADIES ARE TAKING OVER?
WALK ME THROUGH THE NIGHTMARE
SCENARIO WHEN WOMEN RUN THINGS.
EXCLUSIVELY, BECAUSE THAT'S THE
PORTRAIT YOU'RE PAINTING.
>> EXCLUSIVELY.
EXCLUSIVELY.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE A
TICKET FOR THE FUTURE AND WE'RE
NOT.
>> SOME OF THAT IS TRUE.
IN SOME CLASSES WOMEN ARE DOING
BETTER.
THEY'RE MORE FLEXIBLE.
THEY'RE GETTING MORE COLLEGE
DEGREES AS YOU POINTED OUT.
THEY'RE OF THE GROWING
PROFESSION, MOST OF THEM ARE
DOMINATED BY WOMEN.
THEY ARE ADJUSTING TO THE NEW
ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG BEFORE A
WOMAN IS CROWNED "PEOPLE"
MAGAZINE'S SEXIEST MAN ALIVE?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHEN WE'LL KNOW WE'RE
DONE.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: IT SHOULD... DO
YOU HAVE SONS?
>> I DO.
I HAVE TWO.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU
RECOMMENDING GENDER REASSIGNMENT
SURGERY?
LIKE WHAT... HOW DO YOU GIVE
THEM ANY HOPE?
I COULD DO IT BECAUSE I ALREADY
HAVE THE HIPS FOR IT, BUT WHAT
HOPE... HOW CAN MEN FIGHT BACK?
IF YOU WANT TO HELP THE ENEMY,
HOW CAN MEN FIGHT BACK AND REST
CONTROL BACK AWAY FROM WOMEN?
BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU DO HAVE
TOTAL CONTROL, REMEMBER I WAS
ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.
>> I WILL.
WE WILL.
YOU WILL BE THE RIGHTEOUS MAN
TILE.
>> Stephen: MANTILE?
I LIKE IT, NO, NO, I LIKE IT.
HOW DO MEN GET THEIR EDGE BACK?
>> YOU KNOW, IN PLACES LIKE
AUSTRALIA AND IRELAND, THEY
ACTUALLY HAVE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
FOR MEN, AND SOME UNIVERSITIES
WERE SUED FOR LETTING MEN IN WHO
HAD LOWER GRADES AND EVERYTHING
THAN WOMEN.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE
WE COULD MOVE TO AN ERA WHERE WE
ACTUALLY MAKE SPECIAL
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MEN.
>> Stephen: I WOUND LOOK
FORWARD TO THAT BECAUSE I HAVE
ALWAYS SEEN MYSELF AS A VICTIM.
[LAUGHTER]
HANNA ROSIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
