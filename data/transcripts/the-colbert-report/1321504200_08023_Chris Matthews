( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A
NEW BOOK ABOUT JOHN F. KENNEDY.
ASK NOT WHAT THIS BOOK PLUG CAN
DO FOR HIM BUT WHAT HE CAN DO
FOR HIS BOOK PLUG.
PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS MATTHEWS!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CHRIS, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET A LIVE
AUDIENCEO YOUR SHOW, MAN.
YOU AND I MAY NOT AGREE ON MANY
THINGS, BUT I ADMIRE YOUR
ABILITY TO KEEP WORDS COMING OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.
( LAUGHTER )
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU
BREATHED IN?
>> CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
THE HOST OF "HARTBALL."
EVERYBODY KNOWS.
YOU ALSO HAVELET "CHRIS MATH
USE" SHOW ON NBC.
YOU HAVE THE FULL RESOURCES OF
MSNBC, THE NEWS DECISION
DIVISION AND YET YOU'RE ON MY
SHOW TO PLUG YOUR BOOK, "JACK
KENNEDY: ELUSIVE HERO."
BY COMING ON, YOU HAVE ADMITTED
MY HALF HOUR SHOW HAS MORE PULL
THAN YOUR ENTIRE NETWORK.
YOU REALIZE THAT
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I ACCEPT YOUR SURRENDER.
>> WELL, THE REASON I DID IT IS
BECAUSE YOU HAVE, AS YOU CAN
SEE, LAILTS YOUNGER AUDIENCE
THAN I DO AND I WANTED THEM TO
KNOW WE ONCE HAD A HERO FOR
PRESIDENT AND I WANTED TO TELL
THEM ABOUT THIS GUY.
>> Stephen:  TELL THEM ABOUT
THE JACK KENNEDY CHARACTER.
SOME DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.
>> IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR HE
WAS A SKIPPER OF THE P.T . BOAT
THAT GOT CUT IN HALF BY A
JAPANESE DESTROYER IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT AND DIVED INTO
WATER, SAVED ONE GUY, AND THEN
ENDED UP SAVING THE WHOLE CREW.
HE SWAM FOR FOUR HOURS WITH THE
STRAP OF A GUY'S LIFEJACKET IN
HIS TEETH, PULLING THE GUY-- HE
HAD A BAD BACK TO BEGIN WITH--
AND SAVED THE WHOLE CREW, GOT
THEM HOME.
>> Stephen:  THE BEST PART OF
THAT STORY TO ME IS HE CARVED A
MESSAGE ON A COCONUT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  HE GAVE IT TO,
LIKE, AN ISLANDER.
GAVE IT TO THE NAVY.
>> THEY GOT IT BACK.
HE'S GOT THEM SAVED.
>> Stephen:  CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW THIS GUY WOULD DO ON "THE
AMAZING RACE?"
>> WOULD BE EONE TIME HE HAD A
38 REVOLVER AND A FLASHLIGHT AND
WENT SWIMMING OUT TO THE CHANNEL
AND TREADED WATER ALL NIGHT
TRYING TO FLAG DOWN ANOTHER P.T
. BOAT.
SWAM BACK TO THE ISLAND, THREW
UP ON THE BEACH AGAIN, WENT TO
ANOTHER ISLAND, BROUGHT THE
WHOLE CREW WITH THEM, AGAIN WITH
THE GUY ON HIS BACK, SWAM TO
ANOTHER ISLAND AND WENT TO A
THIRD ISLAND AND FOUND WATER AND
BRACK IT BACK.
HE WAS AN AMAZING HERO, THIS
GUY.
WORD LIKE THAT GETS AROUND WHEN
YOU'RE THAT GOOD TO YOUR CREW.
>> Stephen:  SO HE WON WORLD
WAR II.
THAT PART WE HAVE ESTABLISHED.
WHY DO YOU SAY "JACK KENNEDY:
ELUSIVE HERO."
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO THIS GUY IS.
EVERY OTHER STREET IS NAMED
AFTER HIM.
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
>> HIS WIFE SAID HE WAS AN
UNFORGETTABLE ELUSIVE HERO.
SHE FOUND HIM HARD TO FIGURE IT
OUT.
HE LIVED ONE LIFE WITH HIS WIFE.
HE LIVED ANOTHER LIFE WITH THE
IRISH BUDDIES, AND HIS ELITE
SOCIAL FRIENDS, OLD COLLEGE
BUDDIES.
EVERYTHING WAS A DIFFERENT
COMPARTMENT.
THAT'S HOW HE SURVIVED.
>> Stephen:  ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU SAID ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THIS
ISN'T JUST JACK KENNEDY THE
PRESIDENT, IT'S JACK KENNEDY THE
MAN.
IF YOU WANT TO SELL BOOKS,
SHOULDN'T IT BE JACK KENNEDY THE
TEENAGED VAMPIRE.
>> I TALKED ABOUT HIS TEENAGED
YEARS, HOW HE WAS A TROUBLE
MAKER, HOW HE WAS ALWAYS SICK,
ALWAYS LONELY.
HE LOVED READING ABOUT HEROES,
ABOUT CHURCHILL AND KING ARTHUR
AND IT IS BECAUSE HE WAS LONELY
AND ALWAYS READING AND NOT A
JOCK, THAT HE GREW UP TO BE A
STUDENT OF HEROES AND BECAME A
HERO HIMSELF.
HIS SISTER TOLD HIM THE SAME
THING.
JACK KENNEDY WAS SICK MOST OF
HIS LIFE.
HIS BROTHER SAID IF A MOSQUITO
EVER BIT JACK, THE MOSQUITO
WOULD DIE IMMEDIATELY.
HE WAS ALWAYS SICK.
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
HE HAD ADDISON'S DISEASE.
YOU'RE CATHOLIC.
HE HAD THE LAST RITES IN 1447,
AGAIN IN 1951, ANOTHER IN 1954.
HE WAS NEAR DEATH SO MANY TIMES
--
>> Sstephen:  SO HE'S A
SACRAMENT HOG.
>> YOU KNOW YOU ONLY GET THAT
SACRAMENT WHEN YOU'RE NEAR
DEATH.
HE MANAGED TO MAKE IT TO THE
PRESIDENCY DESPITE ALL THOSE
ILLNESSES.
>> Stephen:  WHY ARE YOU GUYS
-- I MEAN YOU LEFTIES--
>> HE WASN'T A LEFTY.
>> Stephen:  BUT YOU ARE.
WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH
THIS PARTICULAR DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT.
WHY NOT FRANKLIN PIERCE?
WHY NOT GROVER CLEVELAND?
>> FOR AN OBJECTIVE --
>> Stephen:  I'M STILL
TALKING.
TWO NONCONSECUTIVE TERMS.
NO ONE ELSE EVER DID THAT.
>> RECENTLY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WERE ASKED WHO SHOULD BE ON
MOUNT RUSHMORE WITH WASHINGTON,
JEFFERSON, LINCOLN, AND TEDDY
ROOSEVELT, THEY PICKED JACK
KENNEDY.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOVED THIS
PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen:  I GREW UP WITH
ICONES OF HIM IN MY HOUSE
BECAUSE I'M A CATHOLIC.
I THOUGHT EYE THOUGHT MAYBE HE
WAS A SAINT AS A CHILD.
( LAUGHTER )
>> HE WAS A HERO.
AND HE SAVED THIS COUNTRY.
I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS WHO GREW
UP HIDING INSPECTOR A SCHOOL
DESK BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THERE
WOULD BE A NUCLEAR WAR.
THIS GUY GOT US THROUGH THE COLD
WAR WITHOUT HAVING A NUCLEAR
WAR, THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS.
HE WAS THE ONLY GUY THAT DIDN'T
WANT TO GO BLOW UP CUBA.
WHICH YOU CHEF SAID IN HIS
MEMOIR HE WAS GOING TO HIT NEW
YORK WITH HIS WEAPONS.
>> Stephen:  WHO IS THE NEXT
KENNEDY, IS IT GINGRICH?
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ).
>> NO!
>> Stephen:  CHRIS, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, THE BOOK IS
"JACK KENNEDY: ELUSIVE HERO."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
