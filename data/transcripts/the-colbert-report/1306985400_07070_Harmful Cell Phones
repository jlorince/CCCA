I THINK I'VE BEEN HACKED.
THESE SMART PHONES, I TELL YOU,
FOLKS, THEY'RE SO USEFUL, FOR
THIS, FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS.
I USE THEM FOR EVERYTHING.
OBVIOUSLY TWEETING PICTURES OF
MY GROIN, CRACKING WALNUTS,
SPACKLING DRYWALL, REFLECTING
SUNLIGHT INTO AIRLINE PILOT'S
EYES, BUT I TURNS OUT THAT MY
CELL PHONE MAY BE HAZARD TO ME
BECAUSE THE WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION IS NOW WARNING THAT
CELL PHONE USE IS "POSSIBLY
CARCINOGENIC TO HUMANS."
POSSIBLY?
WELL, THEN I AM POSSIBLY
CRAPPING MY PANTS.
ISN'T THERE A SIMPLER WAY TO PUT
THIS?
>> WE BEGIN WITH MAJOR
DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING CELL
PHONE USE AND YOU.
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW
RIGHT NOW.
>> ALARMING NEWS FOR ANYONE WHO
OWNS A CELL PHONE.
>> COULD YOUR CELL PHONE BE
MAKING YOU SICK?
A NEW WARNING THAT YOUR PHONE
COULD CAUSE BRAIN CANCER.
>> IS YOUR CELL PHONE LETHAL?
>> Stephen: ARE CELL PHONES
ARE TRYING TO KILL US.
THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE
THE PHONE.
GET OUT OF THERE.
NOW, LUCKILY, LUCKILY I BLOCKED
THE RADIATION BY ALWAYS KEEPING
MY CELL PHONE TUCKED SAFELY
UNDER MY GENITALS.
IN A PINCH THEY ALSO SERVE AS A
BOMB SHELTER.
APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY CELL
PHONES USE A FORM OF RADIATION
SIMILAR TO MICROWAVES KNOWN AS
"MICROWAVE RADIATION."
WHICH SCIENTISTS SAY ESUCHLY
COOKS THE BRAIN.
I BET YOU ANYTHING I'M
DELICIOUS.
LAUGHTER LAUGH
BUT CELL PHONE MANUFACTURERS ARE
LOOKING OUT FOR US, FOLKS.
THEY RECOMMEND THAT YOU HOLD THE
DEVICE 15 MILLIMETERS AWAY FROM
YOUR HEAD, WHICH CONVENIENTLY
HAPPENS TO BE THE THICKNESS OF
AN AMY'S FROZEN BURRITO.
OKAY.
A QUICK TEN-MINUTE CALL TO NANA
AND LUNCH IS READY.
[APPLAUSE]
HI, NANA.
HI.
I'M DOING THE SHOW.
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.
TALK TO THE BURRITO.
JUST LISTEN TO HER.
OKAY.
BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET BRAIN
CANCER BUT YOU STILL NEED TO
MAKE A CALL?
WHAT DO YOU DO?
EASY.
JAY, COME ON OUT HERE.
LET'S SHOW THE PEOPLE WHAT WE
DO.
JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY.
COME ON OUT.
OKAY.
JAY, I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TALK
TO NANA LIKE WE REHEARSED.
SIT DOWN HERE.
OKAY.
OKAY.
THIS ALLOWS ME TO USE MY CELL
PHONE WITHOUT MY BRAIN ABSORBING
HARMFUL CANCER RAYS.
>> I'M GETTING THE CANCER RAYS.
>> SHHH.
I'M ON THE PHONE.
HOW'S IT GOING, NANA.
ASK HER HOW IT'S GOING.
>> HOW'S IT GOING, NANA?
>> SHE'S NOT YOUR NANA.
CALL HER "MRS. COLBERT."
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MRS. COLBERT?
>> WHAT DID SHE SAY.
>> SHE SAYS HER ANKLES ARE
SWORNING.
>> HER BANK ET IS STOLEN?
>> SOMEBODY STOLE HER BLANKET?
>> Stephen: HANG ON, THIS IS
STILL COLD.
[APPLAUSE]
NOW, WHAT IS SHE SAYING, JAY?
>> I CAN'T HEAR HER THROUGH THE
BURRITO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO TALK LOUDER,
UNANIMOUSBACK IT'S BEEF AND
BEANS.
I TELL YOU WHAT, JAY, STAY ON
THE PHONE AS LONG AS MY NANA
WANTS OR UNTIL THE BURRITO IS
READY, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
