>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
DIRECTOR OF THE NEW FILM,-- OF
FORGOTTEN DREAMS IN 3-D.
>> OUR TIME IS EVEN MORE
CONSTRICTED IN THIS LOCATION
AND THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY
TO GET CLOSE TO THE
PAINTINGS.
>> UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE
THINGS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
SHOW IN YOUR FILM AND YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE.
YOU CAN'T GET CLOSER.
THAT IS THE CASE WITH THESE
ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS
PAINTINGS IN THE FARTHEST
CHAMBER, THIS GROUPING OF
LINES IT IS ESPECIALLY THE
CASE WITH THIS WHERE THE
LOWER PORTION OF A WOMAN'S
BODY HAS BEEN CHANGED.
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD, EVEN
CAVEMEN SENT OBSCENE TWEETS.
PLEASE WELCOME WERNER
HERZOG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHOOO, WHOOO,
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MR. HERZOG.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, THIS
MOVIE IS CALLED CAVE OF
FORGOTTEN DREAMS.
NOW EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE
EXACTLY WHAT IS THIS CAVE,
AND WHERE IS IT?
>> WELL, IT'S IN THE SOUTH
OF FRANCE.
IT WAS DISCOVERED ABOUT 16
YEARS AGO.
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IT
WAS THE OLDEST, IT CONTAINED
THE OLDEST PAINTINGS EVER,
EVER DISCOVERED.
>> Stephen: HOW OLD ARE THEY
OPINIONS 32,000, MAYBE
35,000 YEARS BACK IN TIME.
AND OF ABSOLUTE INCREDIBLE
QUALITY.
>> Stephen: HOW COULD A
PAINTING BE 32,000 YEARS OLD
IF THE ENTIRE WORLD IS ONLY
6,000 YEARS OLD.
>> WELL, THIS IS A MIGHTY
GOOD QUESTION BUT I THINK
THESE PEOPLE WERE VERY, VERY
INGENUOUS AND WELL ADAPTED.
THEY PAINTED WONDERFUL
ANIMALS.
THEY CREATED MUSIC.
THEY CREATED IVORY STATUETTES,
VENUS STATUETTES.
UNBELIEVABLE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
IS THIS CAVE PORN?
>> NOT REALLY BUT I-- MORE
PEOPLE COME TO THE MOVIE IF
YOU SAY CAVE PORN.
>> NO, I DO BELIEVE THAT
THESE VERY INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE INVENTED GOD BUT IT
TOOK GOD AWHILE TO GROW UP
AND CREATE THE WORLD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I DON'T USUALLY
HAVE GUESTS THIS DEEP.
YOU SHOOK ME THERE FOR A
SECOND.
ARE YOU SAYING THESE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY WERE CREATING-- THESE
ARE INCREDIBLE WORK OF ART.
>> THE PANTINGS ARE OF
SUCH-- IT'S INCREDIBLE
QUALITY.
IT NEVER GOT BETTER IN ROMAN
AND IN GREEK ANTIQUITIES,
NEVER GOT BETTER IN THE
MASONS TIME T NEVER GOT
BETTER UNTIL PICASSO.
IT NEVER GOT ANY BETTER.
>> Stephen: IT GOT BET WE
ARE PICASSO?
HE'S THE ONE WHO THROUGH IN
EXTRA TITTIES EVERY PLACE.
HE CAN'T COUNT HOW MANY HE
THROUGH IN THERE.
>> I PERSONALLY HAVE SOME
DOUBTS ABOUT PICASSO MYSELF.
>> Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU A
SENSITIVE QUESTION HERE.
ARE YOU MAKING ANY OF THIS
STUFF UP?
BECAUSE YOU HAVE CAUSED SOME
FLACK FOR YOUR DOCUMENTARIES
BECAUSE YOU SOMETIMES MAKE
STUFF UP.
OR YOU SAY, INTENSIFIED.
AND I DO THAT EVERY NIGHT
RIGHT UNDER THAT LENS OVER
THERE.
I MADE UP SOME CRAZY STUFF.
AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY
KNOWS WHAT'S WHAT.
>> WELL, IN CAVE OF
FORGOTTEN DREAM THERE IS A
POSTSCRIPT THAT ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU SEE RADIOACTIVE
ALBINO CROCODILES.
IN THE FILL AM.
I CALLED THE PRODUCER FROM
WHEN I WAS SORTING AND I
SAID-- HE WAS IN A PET STORE
IN VANCOUVER AND HAD JUST
HAD BOUGHT A CAGE FOR A
HAMSTER.
AND HE SAID I'M JUST BOUGHT
A CAGE OF A HAMSTER AND I
SAID I'M FILMING ALL BINA
MUT ANT CROCODILES,
RADIOACTIVE CROCODILES.
AND I HEAR THIS CLATTER.
HE DROPPED THE CAGE AND SAID,
YOU ARE SHOOTING WHAT?
AND I SAID I'M SHOOTING ALL
BINA CROCODILES.
AND THEY WILL BE IN THE
FILM.
SO IT IS A WILD SCIENCE
FICTION SO THE FANTASY AT
THE END.
AND I WANT THE AUDIENCE, I
WANT THE AUDIENCE WITH ME IN
WILD FANTASIES IN SOMETHING
THAT ILLUMINATES THEM.
IF I WERE ONLY FACT-BASED,
YOU SEE, THE BOOK OF BOOKS
IN LITERATURE THEN WOULD BE
THE MANHATTAN FILM DIRECTOR.
4 MILLION ENTRIES,
EVERYTHING CORRECT.
BUT IT IS OUT OF MY EARS AND
I DO NOT KNOW DO THEY DREAM
IT AND I JUST DISMISS
THE-- CRYING IN HIS PILLOW
AT NIGHT.
WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING WHEN
WE CHECK ALL THE CORRECT
ENTRIES IN THE FILM
DIRECTORY.
I'M NOT THIS KIND OF A
FILMMAKER.
I'M NOT THIS KIND OF A
FILMMAKER.
AND I-- .
>> Stephen: SIR, IF I MAY, I
WANT TO PARTY WITH YOU,
COWBOY.
