(APPLAUSE)
EVERYONE'S EXCITED ABOUT IT.
IT'S HAPPENMENTING, BANK ON IT.
NATION, IT'S ALMOST THE
THREE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF
OCCUPY WALL STREET AND I WOULD
BUY THESE GUYS A CAKE BUT THEY'D
PROBABLY JUST COMPLAINED ABOUT
THE ICING INEQUALITY BETWEEN THE
TOP AND THE BOTTOM LAYER.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT NOW THEY'VE BEEN KICKED OUT
OF OUR PARKS.
I THOUGHT THE DRUM CIRCLE PITY
PARTY WAS OVER.
BUT THEY'VE MOVED ON TO
OCCUPYING SOMETHING MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT-- OUR T.V. SHOWS.
JIM?
>> OCCUPY WALL STREET PROTESTERS
SHUT DOWN FILMING FOR THE HIT
NBC T.V. SHOW "LAW AND ORDER
S.V.U."
>> THE SHOW WAS GETTING READY TO
SHOOT AN EPISODE BASED ON THE
OCCUPY MOVEMENT.
T.V. CREWS EVEN FILMED A FAKE
OCCUPY CAMP BUT THE REAL PROTEST
SWARMED THE T.V. SET.
>> WHOSE STATE PARK?
OUR STATE PARK!
>> Stephen: HEY, WHY ARE YOU
ATTACKING "LAW AND ORDER"?
THAT SHOW IS CLEARLY PART OF THE
99%-- OF T.N.T.'S PROGRAMMING.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, JUST LIKE IN LAW AND
ORDER THERE IS A SECOND VICTIM--
THE TAXPAYER.
BECAUSE IT TOOK 100 POLICE
OFFICERS TO EVICT THE HEAVILY
UNARMED PROTESTERS FROM THE SET.
THESE NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS
ARE EXPENSIVE.
JUST LOOK AT THE GENEROUS
PORTIONS OF PEPPER SPRAY AND THE
BILLY CLUB THEY ARE HANDING OUT.
IT'S AN ALL YOU CAN BEAT BUFFET!
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FORTUNATELY, THERE'S A WAY
TO PAY FOR THESE PROTESTS AND IT
BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET THEM BUY CAKE.
WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND T.C.B.Y.
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH SCOTT
WALKER KNOWS ALL ABOUT PROTESTS.
BACK IN FEBRUARY, AFTER HE CUT
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THERE WERE
MASSIVE PROTESTS THAT WALKERS
ADMINISTRATION SAYS CAUSED $7.5
MILLION WORTH OF DAMAGE-- A
FIGURE THAT WAS LATER SLIGHTLY
MODIFIED TO $270,000.
(LAUGHTER)
HEY, THEY JUST ROUNDED TO THE
NEAREST $7.5 MILLION.
WELL, COCOVER THE COST OF THOSE
DEMONSTRATIONS WALKER IS NOW
IMPLEMENTING A BOLD NEW POLICY
WHICH WILL REQUIRE PROTESTERS TO
PAY FOR THE RIGHT TO PROTEST.
$50 PER HOUR PER CAPITAL POLICE
OFFICER.
$50!
FOR A COP!
I SAY THAT'S A BARGAIN!
I MEAN, THIS VISIONARY
INITIATIVE... THIS INITIATIVE
WILL BE PHASED IN BY DECEMBER
16-- JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS.
AND, FOLKS, WALKER'S POLICY
STANDS ON FIRM CONSTITUTIONAL
GROUND AFTER ALL, WE ALL KNOW
FREEDOM ISN'T FREE SO IT'S
LOGICAL THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
WOULD COST MONEY.
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE
WOULDN'T HAVE A BUDGET PROBLEM
IF WE HAD BEEN CHARGING
PROTESTERS ALL ALONG.
THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE MADE A
BUNDLE OFF THOSE HIPPIES DURING
VIETNAM!
NOW I KNOW...
(LAUGHTER)
I KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOU 99%ERS
ARE THINKING.
HOW CAN POOR FOLK AFFORD TO
EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS?
SIMPLE: THE SAME WAY ANYONE PAYS
FOR ANYTHING IN AMERICA.
CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP.
YOU SEE, ONE OF THE THINGS...
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE
PROTESTING IS A SUPREME COURT
RULING THAT MONEY EQUALS SPEECH.
AND LET'S FACE IT.
CORPORATIONS CAN AFFORD A TON OF
SPEECH!
CORPORATIONS ALREADY FUND SPORTS
STADIUMS, PARADE FLOATS, EVEN
LATE-NIGHT TELEVISION SHOWS.
WHICH REMINDS ME, I AM PARCHED.
: AHH.
(LAUGHTER)
NOTHING ABOUT THESE PROTESTS
WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE.
I MEAN, WHAT'S A TENT BUT A
LIVE-IN BILLBOARD.
JUST SLAP A LOGO ON THERE.
THIS PROTEST AT BANK OF AMERICA
BROUGHT TO YOU BUY BANK OF
AMERICA!
THAT'S WIN-WIN.
AND WITH ENOUGH CORPORATE
CASH...
(LAUGHTER)
PROTESTERS COULD AFFORD TO
PROTEST THIS NEW
PAY-FOR-PROTESTING POLICY.
WHICH I WOULD RECOMMEND.
BECAUSE THIS LAW PROVES THAT
PEOPLE MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO
FREE SPEECH.
BUT ONLY MONEY
