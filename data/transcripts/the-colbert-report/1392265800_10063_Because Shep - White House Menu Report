>> Stephen: FOLKS, LASTNIGHT-- LAST NIGHT WAS NOT HIS
ONLY DRAMATIC INTERPRETATION OFA WHITE HOUSE MENU.
HE HAD BEEN COVERING THEPRESIDENTIAL PANTRY FOR SOME
TIME NOW.
IN FACT, ON THE DAY OF THE STATEOF THE UNION HE WAS INVITED TO
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR LUNCH ANDWAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE
COURAGE TO ASK THE TOUGHQUESTION "ARE YOU GONNA FINISH
THAT ROLL?">> THERE IS NO BETTER FOOD ON
PLANET EARTH THAN WHAT COMES OUTOF THAT WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN.
HERE IS THE MENU.
THEY HAD WINTER LETTUCES WITHSHAVED VEGETABLES.
THEY HAD HONEYED PECANS INTHERE.
THE OTHER THING THAT CAME WITHTHIS WAS A REGGIANO CRISP
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT'S LIKE ACRACKER WITH AIR HOLES IN IT AND
IT TAKES LIKE CHEESE.
MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WASBUT THE ENTREE WAS DRY AGED
PIEDMONTESE BEEF.
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S FROM THE PIEDMONT REGION OFITALY.
THE CALVES ARE BORN FAWN INCOLOR.
IT COMES WITH A SHALLOT JOUS,LIKE AN AU JOUS.
I'M ASSUMING THAT'S AN AU JOUSTHAT SHALLOTS HAVE BEEN INFUSED
IN IT.
THERE WERE FOUR PIECES OFPIEDMONT EASE BEEF.
AND ROOT VEGETABLES.
WHAT KIND OF ROOT VEGETABLES DIDTHEY SERVE WITH THAT?
(LAUGHTER)>> UM --
>> LITTLE BITTY PEARL ONIONS ANDWHAT ELSE CAME WITH IT?
I WROTE IT DOWN.
>> RADISHES.
>> I WROTE IT DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)>> SQUASH, PEARL ONIONS AND
THESE TERRIFIC GREENS, I DON'TKNOW WHAT THEY WERE.
THIS IS WHAT THEY SERVED TODAY.
THIS IS LOUIE CHARDONNAY FROMNAPA, A 2012.
THERE'S SORBET ON THE SIDE SO ILOOKED OVER TO SEE WHAT DIANE
SAWYER WAS DOING AND SHEACTUALLY ATE HERS LATER BUT
PEOPLE WERE USING THEIR FORKS.
I USE MID-FORK AND WHEN I TRIEDTO CUT IT IT EXPLODED.
>> Stephen: GREAT REPORTING,SHEP, STAY ON THIS STORY AS IT
DIGESTS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
