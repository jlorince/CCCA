EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT HARNESSING THE POWER OF OUR DARK SIDE.
"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK" IS MY FAVORITE NOVEL.
PLEASE WELCOME DEEPAK CHOPRA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, MR. CHOPRA, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE.
LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT, MY FRIEND.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
SECOND TIME HERE.
I'VE GOT TENNIS ELBOW.
CAN YOU HEAL ME?
CAN YOU HEAL ME WITH SCENTED OILS?
>> THROUGH ENERGY WORK,
ACUPUNCTURE, ACUPRESSURE AND THERAPY, BUT MOST IMPORTANT STOP PLAYING TENNIS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: DONE BECAUSE I NEVER STARTED.
NOW YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE SHADOW EFFECT: ILLUMINATING THE
HIDDEN POWER OF YOUR TRUE SELF." DEEPAK CHOPRA, WHAT IS "THE SHADOW EFFECT"?
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE SHADOW IS THAT PART OF YOURSELF THAT IS EMBARRASSED,
THAT IS FULL OF SHAME.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.
>> YOU JUST TOLD SOMEBODY THAT YOU WOULD NOT TELL YOUR MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I CAME OUT HERE MINUTES AGO.
I DID NOT SPEAK TO THE AUDIENCE AT ALL BEFORE THIS SHOW.
>> I WAS WATCHING.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NO SHAME.
I HAVE NO FEARS.
I HAVE TAKEN EVERY DARK PART OF ME AND STUFFED IT INTO A PORTRAIT THAT I KEEP IN MY
ATTIC, AND IT DISPLAYS ALL THE CORRUPTION OF AGE.
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR SHADOW
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.
SHOULD I STRAP IN FOR THIS?
>> THE SHADOW ALSO HAS A GIFT.
SO I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE SHADOW.
>> Stephen: THE SHADOW HAS A GIFT?
THE SHADOW SOUNDS DARK AND BAD.
>> IT COMES WITH A GIFT.
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE SHADOW.
IT'S YOUR POMPOUS...
>> Stephen: POMPOUS OR CONFIDENT?
>> ARROGANT.
>> Stephen: CONFIDENT.
CONFIDENT.
>> MR. KNOW IT ALL.
>> Stephen: CONFIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW COME... YOU'RE VERY CRITICAL OF OTHER PEOPLE, SIR.
THAT'S YOUR DARK SIDE.
YOU FIND A LOT OF FAULT IN OTHER PEOPLE, SIR.
YOU'RE A REAL DOWNER.
>> LET ME TELL YOU THE GIFT THAT YOU HAVE.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> THE GIFT THAT YOU BRING WITH YOUR DARK SIDE IS THAT YOU OFFER
COMIC RELIEF TO AMERICA IN THESE TIMES WHICH ARE VERY TURBULENT AND FULL OF DARKNESS.
>> Stephen: COMIC RELIEF?
I AM DOING MY BEST TOKER THE PHI THESE MOTHER [BLEEP].
>> YOU MIGHT THINK YOU'RE DOING THAT, BUT ACTUALLY YOU'RE
DIFFUSING THE STRESS IN THE WORLD THROUGH SHOWING AMERICA ITS DARK SIDE.
YOU DO THAT EVERY DAY.
IN FACT, EVERY SHOW THAT YOU DO IS ABOUT THE SHADOW.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT J.W. JON STEWART.
I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 11:00 SHOW, BECAUSE THAT GUY'S GOT A BIG DARK SIDE.
I WORKED FOR THAT CAT FOR EIGHT YEARS.
SOME SICK STUFF HAPPENED OVER THERE.
>> I SHOULD SAY THAT BOTH OF YOU ARE EXTREMELY GOOD, AND, YOU
KNOW, BECAUSE OF YOU, WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF STRESS RELIEF IN THIS COUNTRY.
OTHERWISE WE'D BE WATCHING GLENN BECK ALL THE TIME.
>> Stephen: AS WELL YOU SHOULD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I BELIEVE, AND WE'LL GET TO THIS IN TOMORROW'S SHOW, I BELIEVE GLENN BECK IS A PROPHET.
>> IF BY THAT, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, YOU MEAN P-R-O-F-I-T,
THEN HE IS.
>> Stephen: CHA-CHING, BUT GOD WANTS HIM TO BE PROSPEROUS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
GOD WISHES US TO BE RICH.
JESUS WAS RICH.
JESUS WAS RICH.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW COULD HE AFFORD ALL THOSE LOAVES AND FISHES?
NOW, DARK SIDE, WHAT'S YOUR DARK SIDE, SIR?
LET'S HEAR ALL THE DARK SECRETS?
WHAT DO YOU GOT TRAPPED IN YOUR CRAWL SPACE?
>> I HAVE AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY, SO ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO I MOVED FROM SPIRITS TO SPIRITS.
>> Stephen: I'M OVER HERE.
I'M OVER HERE.
>> I MOVED FROM SPIRITS TO SPIRIT 30 YEARS AGO.
>>
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, SPIRIT TO SPIRIT?
>> I HAD THIS ADDICTION.
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY ADDICTION TO ALCOHOL AND CIGARETTES.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> AS A PRACTICING DOCTOR, I WAS WORRIED THAT I WAS NOT ONLY HURTING MYSELF BUT MY PATIENTS.
>> Stephen: DID YOU EVER GO TO THE OPERATING ROOM LIKE THAT?
>> JUST AFTER RESCUING A PATIENT FROM A CARDIAC ARREST, I USED TO GO OUTSIDE AND SMOKE A CIGARETTE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S YOUR DARK SIDE?
THAT'S A LAME DARK SIDE.
[LAUGHTER]
COME ON, LET'S GET JUICIER HERE,
SOMETHING INVOLVING A 50-GALLON DRUM OF WESSON OIL AND A DOLPHIN.
THEY HAVE HAIR.
>> I TRIED L.S.D., MUSHROOMS.
>> Stephen: YOU DID?
ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW?
>> I'M HIGH ON LIFE RIGHT.
NOW I'M HIGH ON SPIRIT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELL, MR. CHOAP REMARKS THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY AND GIVING US A CONTACT HIGH.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, AS A CHRISTIAN, I BELIEVE IF YOU HAVE DARK SIDE, WELL,
THAT IS A DEMONIC POSSESSION.
WE MUST DRIVE IT OUT.
OUR SOUL IS ALL LIGHTNESS.
IT IS NOT A DUALITY.
THAT IS A HERESY THAT WAS DRIVEN OUT OF THE CHURCH BY THE COUNCIL
OF NIGH SEE YA, AND YOU'RE LUCKY THIS WAS 1700 YEARS AGO OR I WOULD BE BURNED AT THE STAKE.
>> YOU KNOW, THE DIVINE AND DIABOLICAL ARE THE SAME.
THE DEVIL IS JUST A DIVINE FEELING.
>> Stephen: THE DEVIL IS THE ONE WHO WOULD NOT OBEY GOD.
MY DARK SIDE IS THE ONE THAT WON'T OBEY MY SOUL?
>> THE FALLEN ANGEL IS THE DEVIL.
THAT'S WHY WE SAY DIVINE IS FEELING ILL TODAY, SO HE'S THE DEVIL.
DIVINE AND THE DIABOLICAL, THE SACRED AND THE PROFEIGN, THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOW, FORBIDDEN
LUST, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, THIS IS THE PARADOX, THE AMBIGUITY,
THE CONTRADICTION OF YOUR TRUE SELF, AND YOU RAISE THIS YOU'RE
READY TO HEAL YOURSELF, YOU'RE READY TO FORGIVE YOURSELF AND DRINK SO YOU BECOME LESS
JERUSALEMAL AND YOU FORGIVE OTHERS, AND THEN YOU GET RID OF ALL THE MEL LO DRAMA THAT IS
PART OF THE TAB LOITS AND SOAP OPERAS THAT IS DRIVING EVERYBODY INSANE.
>>
>> Stephen: AND THAT WILL HEAL MY TENNIS ELBOW?
>> I THINK BETTER, DON'T PLAY TENNIS, WHICH YOU NEVER STARTED.
>> Stephen: DEEPAK CHOPRA,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
THE BOOK IS "THE SHADOW EFFECT."||||
