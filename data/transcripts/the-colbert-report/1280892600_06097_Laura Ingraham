MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NEW
COMMENTATOR ON FOX.
TOGETHER THERE'S NO TELLING HOW
MUCH GOLD WE'LL GET YOU TO BUY.
PLEASE WELCOME LAURA INGRAM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
HEY, LAURA, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE A FELLOW
CONSERVATIVE ON ONCE IN A WHILE.
>> A FELLOW DARTMOUTH ALUM.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
I MISS OUR DAYS BACK ON CAMPUS.
>> I DON'T KISS AND TELL,
STEPHEN.
I WON'T GO THERE.
>> Stephen: I DO, AND IT WAS
MORE THAN KISSING.
>> WHEN YOU WERE HEAD OF THE
CHEERLEADING SQUAD, YOU DID
THINGS WITH POMPOMS.
>> BECAUSE I'M FLEXIBLE.
>> I REMEMBER.
>> Stephen: DO THE REPUBLICANS
TAKE CONGRESS BACK IN NOVEMBER?
>> IF ANYONE CAN SCREW IT UP,
IT'S THE REPUBLICANS.
IT COULD MEAN A LOT OF THE
TOWERING FIGURES OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE OUT.
>> Stephen: DOES THAT WORRY
YOU AT ALL BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I
WANT TO SEE REPUBLICANS ENACT
THEIR AGENDA.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: AND FIND OUT WHAT
IT IS...
[LAUGHTER]
THESE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN
GREAT FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND
ME.
BEING IN OPPOSITION, I MEAN,
CHA-CHING.
MY RATINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN
BETTER.
AND I'M GUESSING YOU'RE
COMPLAINING ALL THE WAY TO THE
BANK.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS
BEEN REALLY BAD FOR THE ECONOMY,
BUT IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR TALK
RADIO, WHICH IS MY BUSINESS.
FOX NEWS, AND, OF COURSE, THE
MASTER COLBERT.
THESE ARE JOBS SAVED AND
CREATED, YOURS AND MINE.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REAL
SCANDAL.
SPEAKING OF CHA-CHING, YOU HAVE
THE NUMBER-ONE "NEW YORK TIMES"
BESTSELLING BOOK, IT'S CALLED
"THE OBAMA DIARIES."
OKAY.
NOW, THESE ARE DIARIES THAT FELL
INTO YOUR POSSESSION WRITTEN BY
BARACK OBAMA?
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: AND FOR SOME
REASON ALSO WRITTEN BY MICHELLE
AND JOE BIDEN.
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I GUESS AS
SOCIALISTS THE DIARY BELONGS TO
EVERYONE.
>> THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, STEPHEN.
WE PAID FOR IT.
WE HAVE TO ENJOY IT.
STEVE
>> Stephen: I GOT IT.
THERE ARE SOME STARTLING THINGS
IN THIS BOOK.
LET ME READ SOME THINGS.
THEY'RE SHOCKING.
OKAY.
THIS IS ON PAGE FOUR.
RIGHT OFF THE BAT SHOCKING
STUFF.
HELL, YES, THIS IS OBAMA
WRITING, IT'S THE FIRST TIME
WE'RE PROUD TO BE AMERICANS.
THIS IS ON INAUGURATION DAY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY VOTED FOR ME.
ADD A FEW GOOFY ICONIC POSTERS
AND HOPE AND CHANGE AND I'M THE
F-ING PRESIDENT.
IT'S THE ERA OF OBAMA THE
BEAUTIFUL.
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIS
PRIVATE MUSINGS WOULD MATCH UP
WITH THE NARRATIVE THE RIGHT IS
TRYING TO PUSH.
>> WE'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.
AS USUAL, CONSERVATIVES ARE
RIGHT ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS ARE
CRAFTED, HOW THESE THINGS ARE
THOUGHT ACTED.
AND IT'S BEEN MASTERFUL.
HE WENT FROM BASICALLY BEING A
COMMUNITY LEAFLETER TO A FEW
SHORT STINTS IN THE STATE SENATE
AND THE U.S. SENATE TO RUNNING
THE BIGGEST ECONOMY OF THE
WORLD.
YOU DON'T GET THERE BECAUSE
YOU'RE DUMB.
I NEVER THOUGHT HE'S DUMB.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
I READ A FAIR AMOUNT OF THIS
BOOK, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
I READ A FAIR AMOUNT OF THIS
BOOK, AND I KNOW HE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE DUMB, BUT THIS
WRITING IS TERRIBLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT IS THE MOST... IT IS THE MOST
BANAL TURNS OF PHRASE.
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYINGS ABOUT
HIS WIFE.
OBAMA WRITES ABOUT MICHELLE'S
DAILY FOOD INTAKE.
HE SAYS THAT MICHELLE'S LUNCH
WAS BABY BACK RIBS, AFTERNOON
SNACK MORE RIBS, BEDTIME SNACK,
THE LAST THREE RIBS.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A POST-RACIAL
AMERICA.
OBAMA IS MAKING THE MOST
HIDEOUS, HACKNEYED RACIAL
STEREOTYPES IN HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> WHAT I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY
DOING, I THINK...
>> Stephen: IT'S SHOCKING.
BUY THE BOOK.
BUY THE BOOK JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT THIS GUY THINKS LIKE.
>> WHEN YOU CALL ME ICHABOD
CRANE, A WIDOW BANSHEE...
>> Stephen: ICHABOD CRANE'S
BANSHEE WIDOW.
THAT IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL.
BANSHEE?
>> Stephen: A BANSHEE?
>> I THINK NATIVE AMERICANS...
STEEP TEA PARTY THAT'S VERY
POSITIVE.
ICHABOD CRANE IS THE HERO OF THE
STORY.
AND BANSHEE JUST WARNS PEOPLE
WHEN A LOVED ONE MIGHT BE DYING.
THEY SCREAM IN THE GRAVEYARD.
>> I THINK THERE ARE OVERTONES
TO, THAT BUT I'M OVER IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE MOST
SHOCKING THING.
>> WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT.
>> Stephen: YOU AND I?
>> DARTMOUTH.
>> Stephen: YOU HAD A MOMENT.
JOE BIDEN IN THE BIARY, THE
BIDEN DIARY, JOE BIDEN SAYS HE
SAW YOU AND HE WANTED TO KISS
YOU.
>> HE APPROACHED ME AT GEORGE
WILL'S ANNUAL BASEBALL PARTY.
HE GRABBED ME BY THE SHOULDER
AND SAID, GOD'S ON TRUTH,
INGRAM, YOUR MY FAVORITE ONE OF
ALL THOSE RIGHT-WINGERS, GOD'S
ONEST TRUTH.
HE WAS LOOK LOOK AT MY EYE.
IS THERE A SECRET SERVICE AGENT
AROUND HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE.
IT WAS HILARIOUS.
>> Stephen: HE'S THE VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SPEAKING FOR ME, I'D GO SECOND
BASE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
COME ON!
>> I DON'T WANT TO REVEAL
ANYTHING MORE.
I THINK THE PEOPLE SHOULD READ
IT FOR THEMSELVES.
THEY SHOULD FIGURE OUT WHAT
CHEMISTRY WAS THERE.
THERE WAS A MOMENT.
>> Stephen: ANYWAY, BUY THE
BOOK.
IT'S CALLED THE OBAMA DIARIES.
IT'S THE NUMBER-ONE BESTSELLER.
IT IS FULL OF TALES OF HORROR
AND YOU KNOW HORROR BECAUSE YOU
DATED KEITH OWNERMAN FOR A
WHILE, DIDN'T YOU?
LAURA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
THE BOOK IS "THE
