(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO PLAY A SONG FROM HIS NEW ALBUM.
HEY, I THINK I JUST RAPPED!
PLEASE WELCOME NAS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT'S UP?
ALL RIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE YOU WERE ON HERE.
>> YES, IT WAS.
>> Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE TODAY YOU ARRIVED ON MY SHOW YOU GOT THE COLBERT BUMP
YOUR ALBUM WENT TO NUMBER ONE,
(LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT?
THIS NEW ALBUM "LIFE IS GOOD" I WANT THIS TO GO TO NUMBER ZERO.
YOU GOT THAT, SENATOR JOHN KERRY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING.
DO ALL RIGHT?
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU, OKAY?
YOU'RE GENERALLY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST RAPPERS OF ALL TIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU'RE ON YOUR TENTH ALBUM.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: DO RAPPERS RETIRE?
>> (LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT LAW SCHOOL?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE 38.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 75 AND RAPPING ABOUT HOW HARD THE PUDDING SKIN IS.
DO YOU EVER SEE YOURSELF NOT DOING THIS?
>> NO, I LOVE IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
AND OTHER GENRES OF MUSIC THERE'S GUYS LIKE MICK JAGGER,
KEITH RICHARDS AND ALL THOSE GUYS, THEY'RE GOING FOREVER.
>> THOSE ARE ACTUALLY ANIMATRONIC VERSIONS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS.
THOSE GUYS HAVE BEEN GONE FOR YEARS.
"LIFE IS GOOD" IT'S AN INTERESTING SUBJECT.
SO I ASSUME THAT'S ALL ABOUT,
LIKE, YOU KNOW THE GOOD THINGS IN LIKE LIKE COMFY QUILT COVERS AND FINDING $5 IN AN OLD PAIR OF PANTS.
(LAUGHTER) WEARING A THIRSTY ROBE AND EATING FIG NEWTONS AND WATCHING
RERUNS OF "MAD ABOUT YOU" AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
(LAUGHTER) IN WHAT WAY IS LIFE GOOD FOR NAS.
ALSO, IS THAT SHORT FOR ANYTHING?
IS IT SHORT FOR NOZZLE?
WHAT IS THAT SHORT FOR?
(LAUGHTER)
>> LIFE IS GOOD BECAUSE WE WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH LIFE.
SO THE MUSIC IS NOT ABOUT QUILTS AND FIG NEWTONS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT....
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD?
>> THAT IS GOOD.
IT'S JUST ABOUT LIFE.
AND JUST BEING HAPPY TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING.
>> Stephen: OKAY, NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT... YOU WOKE UP FOR MANY YEARS WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
OKAY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ON THE COVER OF THIS ALBUM... I'M GOING TO PUT IT BACK UP THERE IN A SECOND.
YOU'VE GOT A GREEN DRESS ACROSS YOUR KNEE.
WHY IS THAT THERE?
WHOSE DRESS IS THAT?
>> THAT'S MY EX-WIFE'S DRESS.
PART OF HER DRESS.
>> Stephen: PART OF HER DRESS?
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT ON YOUR ALBUM COVER?
SHE'S NO LONGER YOUR WIFE.
>> WELL, IN THE HOUSE THAT WE HAD TOGETHER WHEN SHE TOOK HER STUFF OUT THAT PART OF THE DRESS
WAS IN THE CLOSET BY ITSELF AND IT BOTHERED ME A LOT AND FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHILE I WAS MAKING THIS ALBUM I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE DIVORCE A LITTLE BIT AND IT JUST WOUND
UP IN THERE.
>> Stephen: YOUR EX-WIFE WAS CALISE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THERE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE FACT THAT HER MILKSHAKE BROUGHT ALL THE BOYS TO THE YARD.
(LAUGHTER) S THAT A PROBLEM ON ANY LEVEL?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THAT WAS JUST A SONG.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WILL YOU SING US A FEW THINGS, OR RAPSTER US A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE THINGS PEOPLE
GO THROUGH?
>> YES, I WILL.
>> Stephen: LIFE IS GOOD AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY NAS.
THANK YOU,
