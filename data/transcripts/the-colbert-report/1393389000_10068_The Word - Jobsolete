( CHEERS )BOTTOM LINE THE PENTAGON WILL
CUT AS MANY AS 80,000 ACTIVEDUTY TROOPS, ADDING TO AN
ALREADY TERRIBLE UNEMPLOYMENTRATE.
THANKFULLY, CONGRESS IS TAKING ASTAND, AND THAT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
JOBSOLETE.
NATION, THERE ARE THOSE OUTTHERE WHO SAY THE ONLY THING
AMERICA MANUFACTURERS ANY MOREARE EASY CHEEZ AND PEOPLE WHO
THINK THEY'RE ALLERGIC TOGLUTEN.
( LAUGHTER )BUT, FOLKS, THEY ARE WRONG.
WE ALSO MAKE BOMBS.
AND GOOD NEWS, WHILE THE BUDGETCUTS JOBS FOR SOLDIERS, IT
SPARES MOST ARMS MANUFACTURERSWHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY, SHARES
OF LOCKHEED MARTIN, NORTHROPGRUMMAN, GENERAL DYNAMICS, AND
RAYTHEON ALL HIT 52-WEEK HIGHS.
FINALLY, AN ANSWER TO THEQUESTION, "WAR, GOD GOD Y'ALL.
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR  â™ª ( APPLAUSE )
CREATING JOBS IS WHAT IT IS GOODFOR, FOLKS.
CREATING GOOD JOBS AMERICANS CANCOUNT ON NO MATTER HOW HARD THE
MILITARY TRIES TO END THEM.
>> CONGRESS WANTS TO KEEP RUBBERSTAMPING ATTENTION FLEETS.
>> THE U.S. ARMY HAS A MESSAGEFOR CONGRESS-- THANKS BUT NO
TANKS.
>> THE PRICE OVER THE PAST TWOYEARS HAS BEEN ALMOST HALF A
BILLION DOLLARS, BUT THE ARMYSAYS WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE
TANKS.
>> IT KEEPS JOBS INCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS WHERE
TANKS SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED.
>> Stephen:  WE HAVE TOPROTECT THE JOBS.
IF THE MILITARY DOESN'T NEED THETANKS WE WILL FIND A JOB FOR
THEM.
JUST LOAD UP THE BASEBALLS ANDGIVE THEM A REAL CHALLENGE
IN THE BATTING CAGE.
IT WILL LET SKILLS HONED GO TOWASTE, WHICH I BELIEVE IS RADIO
SHACK'S BUSINESS MODEL.
THESE TANKS AREN'T THE ONLYINNOVATION FROM THE VITAL
USELESS SECTOR.
THERE'S THE C27-J PLANE.
OHIO SENATORS FOUGHT TO ORDER 21OF THESE $50 MILLION PLANES
BECAUSE 800 JOBS AT MANSFIELDAIR FORCE BASE DEPENDED ON IT.
THEN, THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTEDFLEET WAS SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO AN
ARIZONA BONE YARD.
ARIZONA BONE YARD, BY THE WAY,ALSO THE WAY OF TUCSON'S
PREMIERE RETIREMENT HOME FORSWINGERS.
( LAUGHTER )BUT IT, PERHAPS NO USELESS
PIECE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT HASDONE MORE FOR THE AMERICAN
WORKER THAN THE F35 FIGHTERJETS.
AT 400 BILLION ITIS THE MOST EXPENSIVE WEAPONS
SYSTEM IN U.S. HISTORY, DESPITEA FEW DRAWBACKS.
>> HEADLINES TELL A STORY OFYEARS OF DELAYS, COST OVERRUNS,
AND PROBLEMS WITH THE JETS.
RIGHT NOW, THEY STILL CAN'T FLYAT NIGHT.
>> Stephen:  WHICH IS FINE, ASLONG AS AL QAEDA NEVER STAYS UP
PAST THEIR BEDTIME.
( LAUGHTER )BUT, FOLKS, THE F35 PROGRAM IS
TOO BIG TO KILL BECAUSE ITSUPPORTS 133,000 JOBS IN 45
STATES.
BUT IF USELESS WEAPONS EMPLOY SOMANY AMERICANS, I SAY SHOULDN'T
WE BUILD MORE OBSOLETETECHNOLOGY?
I MEAN, LET'S REOPEN FACTORIESTHAT MANUFACTURE BLUNDERBUSSES
OR CHARIOTS, OR WHAT'S THENAME OF THOSE THINGS ON GAME OF
THRONES THAT BASH OPEN DOORS?
AND WHY AND WHY JUST USELESSTHINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST?
WE CAN CREATE NEW THINGS THATNOBODY WANTS.
I PROPOSE A CUTTING EDGEWEAPONS SYSTEM, THE F-U-435
EMPLOYMINATOR.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S PART TANK, PART JET, PART
AIRCRAFT CARRIER, AND ALL CRAP.
( LAUGHTER )BEST OF ALL-- BEST OF ALL,
FOLKS--( APPLAUSE )
IT COSTS A FORTUNE, AND ITWILL TAKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE TO BUILD.
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN WASTING ITON SOMETHING FOOLISH LIKE FOOD
STAMPS BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TOGET AMERICANS BACK TO WORK IS TO
KEEP MAKING THINGS THAT DON'T.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
