( LAUGHTER )
OF COURSE, THE NEW REPUBLICAN
CONGRESS COULD ELIMINATE THE
DEATH TAX, BUT THEY'RE NOT
SEATED UNTIL JANUARY.
SO UNTIL THEN, HERE IS WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH.
>> A LAME DUCK CONGRESS
RETURNING TO WORK.
>> THIS LAME DUCK CONGRESS.
>> THE LAME DUCK CONGRESS.
>> IT'S A LAME DUCK CONGRESS ALL
RIGHT.
>> Stephen: A LAME DUCK
CONGRESS, WHICH IS DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT IT'S NORMALLY CALLED
IN THAT THEY'VE ADDED THE WORD
"DUCK."
THE DANGER HERE IS THAT BEFORE
THEY'VE KICKED OUT OF POWER, THE
DEMOCRATS MIGHT WANT TO DO
SOMETHING HORRIBLE, LIKE DO
SOMETHING.
AND YESTERDAY THERE WAS A
TERRIFYING FLIRTATION WITH
ACCOMPLISHMENT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH
REPUBLICAN LEADERS AT THE SQUAD
SQUAD -- SO-CALLED SLURPEE
SUMMIT, SO-CALLED BECAUSE MANY
OUSTED DEMOCRATS WILL SOON BE
WORKING AT 7-ELEVEN.
AFTER JUST TWO HOURS, YOU WOULD
MOTT BELIEVE ALL THE THINGS THEY
AGREED ON.
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRODUCTIVE
MEETING.
>> WE HAD A VERY NICE MEETING.
>> WE HAVE TWO PARTIES FOR A
REASON.
>> THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
>> I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED.
>> I WAS ENCOURAGED.
>> I WAS PLEASED.
>> I WAS PLEASED ON A NUMBER OF
ACCOUNTS.
>> WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.
>> WORK TOGETHER.
>> AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> JOBS.
>> JOBS.
CONVERSATION.
>> CONVERSATION.
>> ON.
>> ON.
>> BROAD AGREEMENT.
>> I THINK WE ALL AGREED THERE'S
NO PARTICULAR REASON WHY WE
CAN'T FIND AREAS OF AGREEMENT.
>> GET A ROOM ALREADY.
( LAUGHTER )
WITH REPUBLICANS ALL
LOVEY-DOVEY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
GOING TO TRY THE PASS SOMETHING,
HARRY REID JUST TWEETED, "I WILL
MOVE THE DREAM ACT AS A
STAND-ALONE BILL IN THE LAME
DUCK."
FOLKS, OUR WORST FEARS HAVE BEEN
REALIZED.
HARRY REID IS ON TWITTER.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DREAM
ACT.
IS DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO GUNNING
FOR THE REPEAL OF "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL," AND YESTERDAY THE
PENTAGON RELEASED A REPORT THAT
SAID ITS REPEAL WOULD HAVE NO
EFFECT ON MILITARY REDNESS.
BUT I QUESTION THE OBJECTIVE OF
THE STUDY'S AUTHOR, JAY JOHNSON
AND GENERAL CARTER HAMM, TWO
GOOD-LOOKING GUYS WITH SPENT THE
LAST YEAR TRAVELING THE WORLD
TOGETHER, ASKING FIT YOUNG
SOLDIERS THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALITY.
I'M NOT SAYING.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I'M NOT
SAYING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
( APPLAUSE )
BUT A LAME DUCK IS A DESPERATE
AN DEADLY OPPONENT, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
WHEN CORNERED, THEY GET ALL
PECKY AN THEY POOP EVERYWHERE.
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS
WILL DO NOW.
HERE TO TALK ME OFF OF THE
LEGISLATIVE LEDGE, PLEASE
WELCOME ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JAKE TAPPER.
JAKE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
NOW, SIR, SIR, YOU GUYS, FIRST
OFF, ABC, YOU'RE OWNED BY
DISNEY, RIGHT?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Stephen: IF I GO TO DISNEY
WORLD, IS THERE A BIG
FOAM-HEADED JAKE AM THER THAT
GREETS MY KIDS WHEREVER THEY GO?
>> IT'S LATEX.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
AM I RIGHT?
IS SOMETHING GOING THE HAPPEN
HERE?
BECAUSE I'M SCARED THAT
SOMETHING MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED.
>> YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED.
PROBABLY VERY, VERY LITTLE WILL
BE ACCOMPLISHED, VERY, VERY
LITTLE.
I WOULD QUESTIONS THAT SOME SORT
OF DEAL WILL BE STRUCK WITH THE
BUSH TAX CUTS, EXTENDING THEM.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S "A DEAL"
MEAN?
>> PROBABLY THE DEMOCRATS WILL
ROLL OVER QUITE A BIT.
>> Stephen: THEY'LL DO EXACTLY
WHAT THE REPUBLICANS SAY?
I JUST DON'T WANT ANY COMPROMISE
BY THE REPUBLICANS.
>> THE REPUBLICANS WILL PROBABLY
ALLOW THE BUSH TAX CUTS FOR THE
WEALTHY TO ONLY BE REINSTATED ON
A TEMPORARY BASIS.
THAT WILL BE WHERE THE DEMOCRATS
DRAW THE LINE.
YES, WE'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING
WE WANT BUT ONLY ON A TEMPORARY
BAY SIX.
THE REPUBLICANS DON'T GET TO
HAVE THEM PERMANENTLY.
>> HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET ABOUT
THE LAME DUCK SESSION.
WHY DO THOSE GUYS GET TO EVEN GO
BACK THE WORK?
THE DEMOCRATS WERE DEFEATED.
IT'S LIKE SAYING TO A BANK
PRESIDENT CAUGHT EMBEZZLELING,
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FIRED BUT YOU
GET TO STAY HERE FOR A MONTH
LONGER WITH THE KEYS TO THE
VAULT.
>> BUT THAT HAPPENS.
PEOPLE GET FIRED AND THEY GET TO
STICK AROUND THEIR JOBS FOR A
COUPLE YEARS.
YOU KNOW THIS, YOU WORK IN THE
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: I'VE WORKED AT
NETWORK.
WHY AREN'T THESE GUYS
FROG-MARCHED TO THE DOOR AND
SENT THEIR CHECK?
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A LAME
DUCK?
>> ONE OF THEM IS A LOT OF THE
NEW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DON'T
KNOW HOW TO BE CONGRESSMEN YET.
THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO PASSES
LAWS AN LEARNING ALL THE CIVICS
LESSONS THAT YOU PROVIDE SO ABLY
HERE.
>> IF THEY DON'T LEARN HOW TO DO
ANYTHING, NOTHING WILL GET DONE.
WON'T THAT LEAD TO A SMALLER
GOVERNMENT?
( LAUGHTER ) OR DID I JUST BLOW
YOUR MIND?
THESE GUYS, DO THE PEOPLE
LEAVING OFFICE EVER JUST SAY F-U
TO THEIR HOME DISTRICT THAT
VOTED THEM OUT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
SOME OF THEM DON'T SHOW UP TO
WORK.
THAT IS TRUE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
I'D SHOW UP TO WORK, BUT I'D
SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M
REINSTATING THE DRAFT.
>> JUST FOR MY DISTRICT.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
INDIVIDUAL BILLS.
IN THE LAME DUCK AGENDA, DO YOU
THINK "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" IS
GOING TO BE REPEALED?
DO YOU THINK THE VOTES ARE
THERE?
>> THE VOTES ARE THERE.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT
THE REPUBLICANS WILL LET IT COME
TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE.
>> DO YOU THINK THIS REPORT THAT
JUST CAME OUT IS GOING TO HAVE
ANY EFFECT?
>> IT'S INTERESTING...
>> Stephen: BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
I SHOULD ASK YOU IF YOU FIND ME
ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE I WANT TO
KNOW IF YOU'RE BIASED ON THIS
ONE.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE
GREEN ROOM, AN I ONLY THINK OF
YOU AS A FRIEND.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER AND
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: IN THAT CASE,
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
