PLANE CRASHES ON PARADISE ISLAND1941.
AND THE U.S. MILITARYINTELLIGENCE OFFICER NEEDS TO BE
SAVED SO PRINCESS DIANA LEAVESTHE ISLAND, GIVES UP THE CROWN.

>> Stephen:  OKAY.
SHOULD A 73 YEAR OLD WOMAN BEWEARING AN OUTFIT LIKE THAT.
>> I THINK LIKE THE ETERNALLIFE KIND OF RUBBED OFF.
LIKE AN ANTI-AGING AFTER EFFECT.
>> Stephen:  WAS SHE AFEMINIST ICON OR WAS THERE EVEN
A THING CALLED THAT AT THE TIME.
>> THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY A THINGCALLED THAT.
THE THING THAT'S INTERESTINGABOUT THE SECRET OF WONDER WOMAN
IS FIRST OF ALL I NEVER KNEW ANYOF THIS.
I WAS NEVER A COMICS PERSON.
BUT THE OLDEST FEMALE COMICSUPER HERO WHO HAS LASTED THIS
LONG.
SUPERMAN STARTS IN 1938.
BATMAN 1939, BAT WOMAN NEVERBEEN OUT OF FRANCE SHE JOINS THE
JUSTICE SOCIETY IN 1942.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF READERS.
A WOMEN ISN'T ALLOWED TO JOINTHE JUSTICE SOCIETY.
>> Stephen:  SHE'S ALLOWED TOJOIN.
>> SHE'S VOTED IN.
ONLY EIGHT KIDS VOTED AGAINSTHER. IT'S A WALK-OFF.
>> Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND WHENSHE'S FIRST ELECTED TO THE
JUSTICE SOCIETY SHE'S THESECRETARY.
>> YES, THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen:  SHE'S THESECRETARY TO THE JUSTICE
SOCIETY.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen:  DOES SHE KICK ALITTLE ASS TO GET OUT OF
THAT JOB BECAUSE I WOULD BEANGRY IF I WERE WONDER WOMAN.
>> IT'S PRETTY ROUGH.
THE GUY WHO CREATED WONDER WOMANIS THIS HARVARD PH.D.
PSYCHOLOGIST NAMED WILLIAMMARSTON
>> Stephen:  THAT'S MY NEXTQUESTION IS HOW CAN SHE BE A
FEMINIST ICON WHEN SHE WASCREATED BY THIS MAN MARSTON
>> HE SAID WONDER WOMAN ISPSYCHOLOGICAL PROPAGANDA FOR THE
NEW TYPE OF WOMAN I BELIEVESHOULD RULE THE WORLD.
[CROWD CHEERING]>> Stephen:  WHAT DOES
FEMINISM MEAN AT THIS TIME.
>> THE INTERESTING THING ABOUTMARSTON CREATING WONDER WOMAN
IN 1941 IS SHE'S REALLY A THROWBACK.
HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE INTHE 1910s AND WAS REALLY
INSPIRED BY THE SUFFRAGEMOVEMENT.
WOMEN GAINED THE RIGHT TO VOTEIN THE 19TH AMENDMENT IN 1920.
HE WAS A FRESHMAN IN HARVARD IN1911 WHEN THE GREAT SUFFRAGISTS
EMMELINE PANKHURST CAME TO CAMPUS. HARVARD BANNED HER
FROM SPEAKING ON CAMPUS, THEY DIDN'T LET WOMEN SPEAK ON CAMPUS
AT THE TIME. SHE GAVETHIS ADDRESS IN HARVARD SQUARE
IT WAS INCREDIBLY ROUSING.  HEMARRIED HIS CHILDHOOD
SWEETHEART WHO WENT TO MTHOLYOKE WHICH WAS A HOTBED OF
SUFFERAGE IN THE 1910s. HEBECOMES A PROFESSOR AND TEACHES
AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY IN 1925.
MY ALMA MATER, TUFTS UNIVERSITY.
[APPLAUSE]AND FALLS IN LOVE WITH ONE OF
HIS STUDENTS WHO HAPPENS TO BETHE NIECE OF MARGARET SANGER WHO
FOUNDED THE BIRTH CONTROLMOVEMENT.
SHE MOVES INTO THE FAMILY ANDTHEY ARE POLYAMOROUS.
>>  THIS GUY WHO IS A FEMINISTHAS GOT TWO WOMEN ONE OF WHOM IS
AN UNDERGRADUATE HE'S TEACHINGAND HIS WIFE IS COOL WITH THAT?
>> SO OLIVE BYRNE IS THEDAUGHTER OF ETHEL BYRNE,
WHO IS MARGARET SANGER'S SISTER.
THEY ARE NURSES AND IN 1914,MARGARET SANGER FOUND THE WOMAN
REBELS, A FEMINIST NEWSPAPER
SORT OF AN ANTECEDENT OF WONDERWOMAN. THEY OPENED THE FIRST
BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC IN THE U.S.IN BROOKLYN
AND THEY ARE ARRESTED FOROBSCENITY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
TALK ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL. THEYCOINED THE PHRASE.
ETHEL BYRNE GOES ON A HUNGERSTRIKE IN JAIL
PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS FOUNDEDIN 1916 BY ETHEL BYRNE AND
MARGARET SANGER.(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen:  SO THE GUY WHOCREATED WONDER WOMAN HAS A WIFE
AND A GIRL ON THE SIDE WHO HEKNOWS IS ON BIRTH CONTROL.
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen:  SO THE PLAYGROUND
IS OPEN, ALL RIGHT.
>> HE SAYS TO HIS WIFE, YOUKNOW, I WOULD LIKE HER TO LIVE
WITH US AND I REALLY LOVE HERAND YOU COULD, EITHER SHE COULD
LIVE WITH US, SHE COULD TAKECARE OF THE CHILDREN AND YOU
COULD GO TO WORK, IT'D SOLVEYOUR PROBLEMS.
>> Stephen:  AS A WOMAN HOW
WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT.
WOULD YOU BE INTO THAT.
WOULD YOU BE DOWN FOR THAT?
>> NO.
THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWER.
>> Stephen:  NO.
>> THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWER.
