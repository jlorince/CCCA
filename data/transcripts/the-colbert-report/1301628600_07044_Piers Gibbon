SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL DO
TO SOMETHING WHO HAS CAUSED
HARM WHO HAS BROUGHT
SICKNESS UPON THE VILLAGE.
AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW.

JUSTICE SYSTEM AND RELIGION

HE WILL SMOKE THE LOCAL
TOBACCO.

INTERESTING.
YOU SAID THAT YOU THINK
PEOPLE ARE TOO SQUEAMISH
ABOUT CANNIBALISM.
WHAT DOW MEAN BY THAT.
HOW YOU CAN BE TOO SQUEAMISH
ABOUT CANNIBALISM.
>> IT'S FAIR ENOUGH TO BE
SQUEAMISH ABOUT CANNIBALISM.
BUT I THINK WE CAN GET TOO
CAUGHT UP IN OUR OWN CULTURE
AND TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE
INITIAL DISGUST MOMENT OF OH,

DISGUST MOMENT AND THEN THE
