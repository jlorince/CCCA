FOLKS, WEINERGAIT MAY HAVE
COME TO A CONCLUSION BY MY
NIGHTMARE IS JUST BEGINNING.
YOU SEE LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU
THAT LIKE WEINER MY TWITTER
FEED WAS HACKED.
BECAUSE SEVERAL PROVOCATIVE
PHOTOS WERE POSTED ON IT
WITH A MESSAGE, I CANNOT SAY
WITH CERTITUDE THAT THIS IS
NOT PART OF MY BODY.
HERE IS ONE SUCH IMAGE.
WELL, FOLKS, IN LIGHT OF
CONGRESSMAN WEINER'S
ADMISSION THAT THIS IS
ACTUALLY HIM, I HAVE TO
CONFESS, THIS IS ACTUALLY
PART OF ME.
NOW THIS IS, FOLKS THIS IS A
PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN ME
AND MY DOCTOR BECAUSE IF
THAT IS PART OF MY BODY I
OBVIOUSLY NEED HELP.
DIDN'T REALLY WORRY ME UNTIL
IT STARTED GROWING TEETH.
I WILL
