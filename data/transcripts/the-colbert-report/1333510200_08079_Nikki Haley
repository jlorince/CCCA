(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GOVERNOR OF MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T SECEDE FROM THIS INTERVIEW.
PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
WHAT'S THIS?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A GREAT DAY IN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> Stephen: EVERYDAY IS A GREAT DAY IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> YES, IT IS.
SO WE WANT TO BRING YOU THE 2011.
AC.C. CHAMPIONS HELMET SIGNED BY COACH SWEENEY AND YOU HAVE TO READ THE INSCRIPTION.
>> THIS IS FROM CLEMSON, THE REVEREND SIR DOCTOR STEPHEN T.
MOS DEF COLBERT GO TIGERS.
ALL IN.
THAT IS FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CLAUSE I'VE GOT FAMILY THAT WORKS FOR CLEMSON.
>> Stephen: .
>> DO YOU?
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
MY SISTER WORKS AT THE DRIVE TRAIN FACILITY IN CHARLESTON WHERE THEY'RE TESTING THE NEW
WIND TURBINE.
>> IT'S AWESOME!
>> Stephen: SO EXCITING.
IT'S GOING TO BE THE LARGEST DRIVE TRAIN TESTING FACILITY FOR WIND TURBINES IN THE WORLD!
EVERYBODY FROM AROUND THE WORLD IS GOING TO TEST THEIR ENGINES IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
ARE WE GOING TO LEAD THE WORLD IN WIND POWER?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
I THOUGHT SO.
ALL RIGHT.
MADAM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
BESIDES BEING THE GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE YOU HAVE A NEW
BOOK CALLED "NIKKI HALEY: CAN'T IS NOT AN OPTION." MY AMERICAN STORY.
HOW IS CAN'T NOT AN OPTION BECAUSE AS A CONSERVATIVE I BELIEVE THAT CAN'T IS A WAY OF LIFE.
YOU CAN'T COME INTO MY COUNTRY AND YOU CAN NOT GET MARRIED IF YOU'RE GAY.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: I'M THE PROUD DAUGHTER OF INDIAN PARENTS THAT BROUGHT US TO A SMALL SOUTHERN
TOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED THERE AND THERE WERE CHALLENGES ALL OUR LIFE.
>> Stephen: IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY.
YOUR PARENTS ARE FROM INDIA.
THEY CAME HERE AS IMMIGRANTS AND NOW YOU ARE NOT ONLY THE FIRST FEMALE GOVERNOR BUT THE FIRST
RACIALLY DIVERSE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
>> I THINK IT SAYS SO MUCH ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA THAT THEY WOULD ELECT A
38-YEAR-OLD INDIAN AMERICAN FEMALE FOR GOVERNOR.
IT SAYS THAT SOUTH CAROLINA HAS CHANGED, IT'S PROGRESSED AND A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE AND START A BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: NOW I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.
SOMETHING I CANNOT AVOID.
YOUR PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS.
THEY CAME TO THE UNITED STATES.
YOU'RE AN ANCHOR BABY.
(LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY.
TECHNICALLY YOU'RE AN ANCHOR GOVERNOR NOW.
>> NO, I'M NOT.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> MY PARENTS CAME HERE LEGALLY WITH $8 AND THEY STARTED ALL OVER.
THEY LEFT WEALTHY LIFE-STYLES...
>> Stephen: $8?
>> THEY WANTED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
>> LITERALLY $8?
>> THAT'S ALL YOU COULD BRING.
>> Stephen: WHEN WAS THIS 1845?
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
NOW WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICS?
BECAUSE I RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN 2008.
>> I REMEMBER.
>> AND I CONSIDERED IT THIS TIME IN 2012 AND I LOVE MY HOME STATE
BUT THE POLITICS ARE ONE NOTCH ABOVE HONDURAS, WOULDN'T YOU SAY IN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S A BLOOD SPORT.
I WEAR HEELS AND IT'S NOT FOR A FASHION STATEMENT, IT'S AMMUNITION.
>> Stephen: YOU KEEP THEM SHARPEND?
>> I DO.
FOR KICKING.
>> Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A SOUTH CAROLINA PALMETTO OFF, IF
I DON'T MIND.
>> I GET TO ASK YOU ONE FOR EVERY ONE YOU ASK ME.
>> Stephen: OH, OKAY, SURE.
SURE, WE CAN PLAY THAT.
I'LL START EASY.
WHAT'S THE STATE BIRD?
>> THE CAROLINA WREN.
WHAT'S THE STATE DRINK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THERE'S A STATE DRINK?
>> IT'S MILK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE MY STATE WAS SO BORING.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE STATE AMPHIBIAN?
>> HMM.
>> Stephen: OH!
HOW DOES IT FEEL WHEN THE SPIKED SHOE IS ON THE OTHER FOOT?
IT'S THE SPOTTED SALAMANDER.
YOU JUST BLEW YOUR REELECTION YOUNG LADY.
>> WHAT'S THE STATE SNACK?
>> Stephen: (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) FRIED ANYTHING.
>> BOILED PEANUTS.
>> Stephen: OH, OF COURSE!
I HAVE TRIED TO FEED MY FRIENDS UP HERE IN NEW YORK BOILED PEANUTS AND THEY ALWAYS JUST SAY
"OH, GREAT, HERE COMES COLBERT WITH MORE OF HIS DAMP FOOD." (LAUGHTER)
WHAT IS NEXT FOR SOUTH CAROLINA?
HOW'S UNEMPLOYMENT GOING DOWN THERE?
>> IT'S DOWN FOR THE SEVENTH MONTH IN A ROW.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CREDIT OBAMA FOR THAT, ARE WE?
>> NO, WE ARE NOT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
(APPLAUSE) NOW YOU HAVE ENDORSED MITT ROMNEY.
WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE POSITION OF THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO CLOSE THE
DEAL WITH WOMEN AND HISPANICS AND YOU'RE A WOMAN AND YOU CAN CHANGE...
>> AND INDIAN.
>> BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE "H" IN HALEY TO A "J" AND WHO WOULD
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?
WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE POSITION IF OFFERD?
>> NO, I WOULD NOT ACCEPT.
AND IT'S BECAUSE...
>> Stephen: HEY, HEY, CAN'T IS NOT AN OPTION.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NIKKI HALEY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA,
GOVERNOR NICKIE HALEY
