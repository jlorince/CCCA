CONCERTO BEFORE SHE DROWNS YOUR
BUNNY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SEX.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOUR
ATTENTION, NOW THAT I'VE GOT
YOUR ATTENTION, DEATH.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
[SIREN BLARES]
NATION, RECENTLY OKLAHOMA PASSED
A BALLOT INITIATIVE FORBIDDING
THE YOUTH OF ISLAMIC SHARIA LAW.
THANK GOD.
IT IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING
OKLAHOMA'S HUGE MUSLIM
POPULATION FROM INSTITUTING
BURQA NIGHT AT THE TULSA
HOOTERS.
UNFORTUNATELY IN OTHER STATES
SHARIA LAW IS STILL COMING AT US
IN A VERY CREEPY WAY.
>> WE HAVE SEEN SHARIA CREEP
ALONG IN ALL KINDS OF WESTERN
COUNTRY.
>> FEARS THAT SCHREEA LAW IS
CREEPING INTO THE UNITED STATES.
>> THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED
CREEPING SHARIA.
>> ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE
PHASE SHARIA CREEP?
>> WOULD SHARIA LAW BE CREEPING
INTO EVERYDAY AMERICAN LIFE,
HIDDEN INSIDE A SANDWICH?
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, A
SANDWICH OF DEATH.
AND FOR ONCE I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT ARBY'S.
THAT'S WHY THREAT NUMBER THREE
IS RADICAL MUSLIM SNACKS.
AS USUAL, PAT ROBERTSON WAS ALL
OVER THIS MEAT MENACE.
>> HELLO, FOOD, IT SOUNDS
INNOCENT.
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH KOSHER?
THAT'S FINE.
I LIKE COACHER.
>> Stephen: OH, THERE IS NO
GREATER FRIEND OF KOSHER THAN
PAT ROBERTSON.
I'D GO SO FAR AS TO CALL HIM A
HEBREW NATIONALIST.
BUT PAT KNOWS THE DANGER OF
HALAL.
>> HALAL IS PREPARED ACCORDING
TO THE RULES OF SHARIA LAW.
>> STEPHEN: AN IMPORTANT
DISTINCTION, FOLKS TO.
SLAUGHTER AN ANIMAL UNDER KOSHER
RULES, YOU CUT ACROSS THE NECK
OF A CONSCIOUS ANIMAL IN ONE
CLEAN ATTEMPT AVOIDING THE
SPINAL CORD, BUT UNDER HALAL,
YOU CUT ACROSS THE NECK OF A
CONSCIOUS ANIMAL WITH A
NON-SERRATED BLADE AVOIDING THE
NECK WHILE SAYING THE NAME
ALLAH.
THAT RADICALIZES THE BRISKET.
NO PROBLEM, YOU SAY, I JUST
WON'T EAT IT, RIGHT IN THAT'S
WHAT THE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN
THOUGHT.
>> THE LONDON "DAILY MAIL"
INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT
BRITAIN'S MAJOR SUPERMARKET
CHAINS, FAST FOOD RESTAURANT,
EVEN SOME HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS
WERE SERVING HALAL FOOD WITHOUT
TELLING THOSE WHO WERE EATING
IT.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE EATING
SECRET MUSLIM FOOD.
AND THAT'S EVEN WORSE THAN
WHATEVER IT IS THE BRITISH
CONSIDER FOOD NOW.
AND, FOLKS, HALAL HAS GOT
AMERICA IN ITS CREEP SIGHTS
>> IN THE UNITED STATES,
McDONALD'S, WAL-MART AND WHOLE
FOODS NOW OFFER HALAL CHOICES.
>> Stephen: NOT CHOICES?
WE'RE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BEING
SERVED FILLET AL' FISH BY IMAM
McCHEESE.
VIGILANCE!
NEXT UP, FOLKS, FOR YEARS I HAVE
BEEN WARNING ABOUT THE THREAT OF
ROBOTS RISING UP AGAINST THEIR
HUMAN MASTERS.
WELL, NOW SCIENTISTS HAVE
REACHED A NEW MILESTONE IN OUR
ENSLAVEMENT -- FLYING ROBOTS
THAT CAN AUTONOMOUSLY ASSEMBLY
MAGNETIC ROBS INTO SIMPLE
CUBE-LIKE TOW ERS.
THERE'S NO REMOTE CONTROL HERE,
FOLKS.
THESE BUZZ BOSTON HAVE A LIVE
MIND OF THEIR OWN AND APPARENTLY
FIRST STEP TO ENSLAVING US IS
BUILDING DORM ROOM SHELVES.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER
TWO, FLYING ROBOT DRONES.
FOLKS, TODAY THEY'RE
CONSTRUCTING A THREE-FOOT TOWER.
TOMORROW IT'S A SPRAWLING PRISON
FOR THREE-FOOT PRISONERS.
PROVIDED THEY CAN BUILD IT
BEFORE THEIR BATTERIES RUN OUT
AND YOU CAN'T BE TOO WINDY.
EVEN IF THEY DON'T ENSLAVE US,
THEY WILL CRUSH US AT JENGA.
VIGILANCE!
AND SPEAKING OF OUT-OF-CONTROL
MACHINE, THIS ALARMING STORY OUT
OF WISCONSIN.
>> A GREEN BAY WOMAN FOUND FOUR
POUNDS OF CRYSTAL METH AND
COCAINE IN A VACUUM CLEANER THAT
HER KIDS HAD GIVEN HER FOR
CHRISTMAS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THOSE DRUGS RUINED
AN OTHERWISE THOUGHTFUL
CHRISTMAS GIFT WITH A LOVING
MESSAGE -- HEY, MOM, CLEAN UP
MORE.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER
ONE, COKED-UP VACUUM CLEANERS.
NATION, THESE DRUG MULES ARE NOW
RUG MULES.
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
HOW DO YOU THINK R OOMBAS CLEAN
YOUR HOUSE FOR TEN HOURS?
CLEARLY THEY'RE ON THE HIGH
SPEED CHICKEN FEED.
NEXT THESE VACUUMS ARE GOING TO
MAKE THEIR DRUG MONEY BY TURNING
TRICKS.
THERE ARE A LOT OF SICKOS OUT
THERE WHO WOULD LOVE TO EXPLOIT
A VACUUM'S ENDLESS SUCTION.
I'M LOOKING AT
