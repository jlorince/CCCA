WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
NATION, I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU THE EMMY AWARDS ARE A
SCANT 109 DAYS AWAY.
WHICH REMINDS ME, I ALMOST
FORGOT, IT'S TIME TO PULL OUT MY
EMMY ADVENT CALENDAR.
HERE WE GO.
[SCATTING]
WHAT'S I GOING TO BE?
OH, IT'S A CHOCOLATE EMMY.
OH, A BEAUTIFUL... OH, OH, AND A
LITTLE ENVELOPE.
AND THE WINNER IS... OKAY.
UH-HUH.
OKAY.
AND THE WINNER IS... "THE DAILY
SHOW WITH JON STEWART."
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
BULL [BLEEPED]
ALL RIGHT.
JON'S MOUTH COULDN'T BE HERE
TONIGHT, SO I ACCEPT THIS ON HIS
BEHALF.
BITTER.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, FOLKS...
[LAUGHTER]
THAT CANDY WAS PUT IN THERE A
LONG TIME AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, YOU KNOW THE EMMY IS THE
ONLY REASON I DO THIS SHOW.
YOU THINK I APPEAR ON MAGAZINE
COVER, COLLABORATE WITH MY
MUSICAL HEROES AND HOBNOB WITH
BILLIONAIRES AND PRESIDENTS
BECAUSE I LIKE IT?
NO.
I KEEP PULLING 70-HOUR WORK
WEEKS AND FORGETTING THE NAMES
OF MY CHILDREN IN HOPES THAT ONE
DAY I HIGH WIN THE HAND OF THE
GOLDEN SIREN OF PRIME TIME
ACHIEVEMENT.
YOU CAN TELL THE EMMY SEASON IS
RAMPING UP BECAUSE THE NETWORKS
HAVE WITHIN SENDING VOTERS
SCREENER D.V.D.s OF ALL THE
ELIGIBLE SHOWS.
OKAY.
YOU SEE, EMMY VOTERS ARE BUSY.
AND VERY ATTRACTIVE.
SO DURING AWARDS SEASON,
NETWORKS COMPILE D.V.D.s OF
THE SHOWS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO WATCH.
OKAY.
I GOT A COUPLE REALLY GOOD ONES
HERE.
THIS IS HBO.
ALWAYS PUTS OUT A CLASSY,
TOP-FLIGHT JOB WITH THEIR
PRESENTATION.
YOU GOT TWO THICK VOLUMES OF THE
MOST INNOVATIVE, PRESTIGIOUS
PROGRAMING ON TELEVISION AN
THREE EPISODES OF "CAT HOUSE"
FROM 1998 THEY'RE STILL RUNNING
ON SATURDAY AT 2:00 A.M.
I WONDER HOW THOSE PROSTITUTES
WILL COPE WITH THE Y2K BUG.
AND, AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO CHECK OUT ANY OF WARNER
BROTHERS SHOWS, THEY'VE SENT
ALONG THIS CONVENIENT PACKAGE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL THE
UNIT FROM ITS ROMBUS-SHAPED
CARDBOARD BOX, SLIP OFF THE
BLACK CARDBOARD COUPL CUMMERBUND
, UNFURL THESE GIANT
POSTERS, AND AT THE BOTTOM YOU
HAVE A D.V.D. SCREENER OF OF "THE
BIG BANG THEORY."
ALL RIGHT.
SO SIMPLE.
ALL RIGHT.
THE POINT IS, YOU SEND OUT A
SCREENER THAT REPRESENTS YOUR
SHOW TO HIGHLIGHT THE BEST THING
YOU'VE DONE THIS WHOLE YEAR.
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY BRINGS ME TO
THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF WHO IS
RIDING MY COATTAILS NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT
NBC/UNIVERSAL'S SCREENING
PACKAGEMENT OKAY.
OUTSTANDING.
LET'S SEE WHO IS OUTSTANDING
THIS YEAR.
OKAY.
"30 ROCK."
OKAY.
GOOD SHOW.
"THE OFFICE."
"OUTSOURCED" "PARENTHOOD" "THE
EVENT.
"FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS."
HERE WE GOSH, LATE NIGHT WITH
JIMMY FALLON, MY BEST FRIEND FOR
SICK MONTHS, AND WHO DOES HE
FEATURE, A PICTURE OF ME.
FROM THE NIGHT I SANG "FRIDAY"
ON HIS SHOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW COULD YOU!
WE'RE COMPETING IN THE SAME
CATEGORY, JIMMY.
YOU'RE TRYING TO BEAT ME WITH
ME.
[LAUGHTER]
I GIVE AWAY $26,000 OF YOUR
MONEY WOULD ASKING AND THIS IS
THE THANKS I GET?
THE WORST PART IS, HE DIDN'T
EVEN SUBMIT THE EPISODE I'M ON.
INSTEAD YOU WENT WITH
SPRINGSTEEN.
HUGE MISTAKE.
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I'LL SAY IT
AGAIN, NILS LOFGREN IS CARRYING
THAT GUY.
MY PICTURE DOWN HERE IS CLEARLY
SENDING THE SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE
"STEPHEN COLBERT THINKS JIMMY
FALLON SHOULD HAVE AN EMMY."
WELL, I DO NOT THINK THAT.
LEFT LAUGHTER YOU KNOW WHAT,
JIMMY, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR BEST
FRIENDSHIP, I CHOOSE TO BE
FLATTERED THAT YOU TOOK
SOMETHING I WORKED HARD TO
CREATE AND USED IT FOR YOUR OWN
GAIN.
AND SINCE I KNOW YOU WERE ON
"THE DAILY SHOW" LAST NIGHT
PROMOTING YOUR NEW BOOK OF THANK
YOU NOTES, I'D LIKE THE TAKE
THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY TO
INTRODUCE MY NEW SEGMENT,
STEPHEN COLBERT'S THANK YOU
NOTES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, JIMMY FALLON, FOR
APPROPRIATING MY FACE TO BOOST
YOUR OWN EMMY CHANCES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D NEED TO,
AFTER ALL, SEGMENTS IN WHICH
AUDIENCE MEMBERS LICK TROMBONES
FOR $10 SCREAM BROADCAST
EXLENGTHS.
[LAUGHTER]
MAY RIDING MY COATTAILS IN YOUR
SCREENER BRING YOU AN EMMY AS
SURELY AS RIDING QUEEN LATIFAH'S
COATTAILS IN TAXI BROUGHT YOU AN
OSCAR.
LOVE, STEPHEN, YOUR BEST FRIEND
UNTIL SEPTEMBER 3rd.
AFTER THAT CITGO TIME, MOTHER
[BLEEPED].
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
