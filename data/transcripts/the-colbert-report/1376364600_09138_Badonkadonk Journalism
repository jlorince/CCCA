( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WHOO!
WHOO!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH
US.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, LIKE MOST AMERICANS OUT
THERE I LOVE WAKING UP TO MY
PALS OVER AT THE "TODAY" SHOW.
I WATCH ALL NINE HOURS EVERY
MORNING.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S MY ONE STOP SHOP FOR NEWS,
SPORTS, WEATHER AND WHO'S
SHARTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, ON FRIDAY "TODAY" HAD MY
FAVORITE RAPPER, FLO-RIDA.
THE LAST BLACK MAN WILLING TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE OF
FLORIDA.
(LAUGHTER)
FAR AND AWAY MR. RIDA IS THE
BEST STATE-NAMED BASED RAPPER
OUT THERE.
EVEN BETTER THAN I SDA HO.
(LAUGHTER)
ILLIN' NOISE AND, ORTHODOX
JEWISH HIP-HOP ARTIST ARI ZONA.
(LAUGHTER)
HOLLA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND I APPLAUD THE VENERABLE
INSTITUTION THAT IS "TODAY" FOR
GIVING MR. RIDA A FORUM FOR
DISCUSSING HIS LOVE OF BIG,
JUICY BUTTS.
♪ I WANNA SEE THAT BUTT
♪ TURN LEFT, TURN RIGHT
♪ TURN AROUND, YOU CAN TELL WHAT
I LIKE ♪
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW, THAT MAY SEEM
LIKE A LARGE SERVING OF BUTT FOR
BREAKFAST--
(LAUGHTER)
-- BUT REMEMBER "TODAY" WAITED
UNTIL 8:47 A.M.
THAT'S JUST JOURNALISM 10 1.
6:00 A.M., HARD NEWS; 7:00 A.M.
HUMAN INTEREST PIECES; 8:30
JACKHAMMERING BADONKADONK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLUS, AS YOU KNOW
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLUS, DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS ODE
TO HIS INCURABLE SICKNESS FOR
THE THICKNESS --
(LAUGHTER)
-- WAS INSPIRED BY OUR LORD.
>>
>> WELL, I HAVE TO ASK THE FIRST
QUESTION.
TELL ME ABOUT THE JESUS PIECE, I
CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF IT.
>> IT'S A SIGN OF SUCCESS.
I PUT GOD FIRST WITH EVERYTHING.
>> Stephen: FLO-RIDA PUTS GOD
FIRST IN EVERYTHING.
HE ONLY WROTE "BUBBLE YUM BUM"
BECAUSE JESUS WAS A BOOTY FAN.
AFTER ALL, HE DID SAY "TURN THE
OTHER CHEEK."
PROBABLY SO HE COULD WATCH THE
LADIES TWERK IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO THANK YOU, FLO-RIDA AND THANK
YOU, "TODAY" SHOW BECAUSE I HAD
MY MORNING TOAST ALREADY AND YOU
KNEW I WAS
