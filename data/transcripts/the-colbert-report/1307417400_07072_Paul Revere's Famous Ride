APP FOR THAT.
NATION, IF YOU ARE'S
ANYTHING LIKE ME, FIRST OF
ALL, CONGRATULATIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT-- IF YOU ARE'S LIKE ME,
IF YOU ARE'S LIKE ME YOU
HAVE BEEN CAPTIVATED BY
SARAH PALIN'S ONGOING PAC
FUNDED VACATIONESQUE
NONCAMPAIGN HISTORY MOBILE
TOUR.
FOLKS, THE ENTIRE TOUR IS
JUST TO RAISE AWARENESS
ABOUT AMERICA'S GREAT
HISTORY.
SO FAR SHE'S LIVED UP TO HER
PROMISE BY VISITING GETTIES
BURG, THE LIBERTY BELL AND
THE ALEXANDER HAMILTON
SERVICE AREA OF THE NEW
JERSEY TURNPIKE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT'S WHERE
HAMILTON FAMOUSLY SWORE HE
WOULD NEVER EAT AT ROY
ROGERS AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW LAST FRIDAY PALIN
VISITED THE OLD NORTH CHURCH
IN BOSTON TO RAISE AWARENESS
OF PAUL REVERE'S FAMOUS
RIDE.
>> HE WHO WARNED US, THE
BRITISH, THAT THEY WEREN'T
GOING TO BE TAKING AWAY OUR
ARMS BY RINGING THOSE BELLS
AND MAKING SURE AS HE IS
RIDIN' HIS HORSE THROUGH
TOWN TO SEND THOSE WARNIN
SHOTS AND BELLS THAT WE WERE
GOING TO BE SECURE AND WE
WERE GONEA BE FREE.
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S JUST
LIKE WE ALL LEARNED IN GRADE
SCHOOL, ONE IF BY LAND,
BELLS IF BY TWO, HEY BRITISH
YOU'RE WARNED, SAIL THE
OCEAN BLUE.
OF COURSE THE LAMESTREAM
MEDIA JUMPED ALL OVER PALIN
ON THE TECHNICALITY THAT
PAUL REVERE NEVER RANG ANY
BELLS OR FIRED ANY WARNING
SHOTS.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN PALIN
WASN'T RAISING AWARENESS OF
HISTORY.
WITHOUT HER, NO ONE WOULD
HAVE CHECK MOOD WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT DID
HAPPEN.
>> YOU REALIZE THAT YOU
MESSED UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE,
DON'T YOU?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN'T
MESS UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE.
HERE'S WHAT PAUL REVERE DID.
HE WARNED THE AMERICANS THAT
THE BRITISH WERE COMING, THE
BRITISH WERE COMING AND THEY
WERE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE
OUR ARMS SO WE GOT TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE WERE PROTECTING
OURSELVES.
AND SHORING UP ALL OF OUR
AMMUNITIONS AND OUR FIREARMS
SO THAT THEY COULDN'T TAKE
IT PART OF HIS RIDE WAS TO
WARN THE BRITISH THAT WERE
ALREADY THERE THAT HEY,
YOU'RE TO THE GOING TO
SUCCEED.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
AMERICAN ARMS.
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO BEAT
OUR OWN WELL-ARMED PERSONS,
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE MILITIA
THAT WE HAVE.
>> Stephen: I COULD NOT HAVE
SAID A RANDOM STRING OF
WORDS BETTER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND FOLKS, GIVE IT UP, GIVE
IT UP.
FOLKS, TO PROVE PALIN WAS
RIGHT ALL ALONG, HER
SUPPORTERS WENT ON WIKIPEDIA
THIS WEEKEND AND EDITED PAUL
REVERE'S PAGE TO ACCURATELY
REFLECT HER VERSION OF THE
STORY.
WELL THAT SETTLES IT FOR ME,
FOLKS.
I GET ALL MY HISTORICAL
INFORMATION FROM WIKIPEDIA,
JUST AS BEACH VOLLEYBALL
INVENTOR ALBERT EINSTEIN DID.
NOW UNFORTUNATELY,
UNFORTUNATELY THE HARD-CORE
FACT ADDICTS AT WIKIPEDIA
HAVE UNDONE THE CHANGES AND
LOCKED PAUL REVERE'S PAGE.
WHICH IS WHY I WANT ALL OF
YOU TO GO TO THE WIKIPEDIA
PAGE FOR BELLS AND MAKE SURE
IT READS, BELLS, USED BY
PAUL REVERE TO WARN THE
BRITISH THAT HEY, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO SUCCEED IN TAKING
OUR GUNS, USA, USA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
USA!
USA!
USA LAM USA!
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
I HOPE WE CAN CAPTURE THAT
IN PRINT.
IN FACT, IN FACT, FOLKS,
BELLS AND WARNING SHOTS HAVE
BEEN KEPT OUT OF OUR HISTORY
BOOKS FOR FAR TOO LONG.
WE'RE NEGLECTING TO TEACH
OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE GREAT
AMERICAN TRADITION OF
WARNING OUR ENEMIES THAT WE
ARE ABOUT TO ATTACK THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHO CAN FORGET
WHEN GENERAL EISENHOWER
KNOCKED ON HITLER'S DOOR AND
SAID HEY, ADOLF WE'RE
LANDING AT NORMANDY, HERE'S
A WARNING SHOT, DING DONG
YOU BASTARD.
AND THEN OUR BOYS STORMED
THE BEACH AT NORMANDY WITH
BELLS AROUND THEIR NECKS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: DIDN'T SEE THAT
IN SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
AND FOR THOSE WHO SAY IT IS
IMPLAUSIBLE FOR REVERE TO
HAVE RIDDEN A HORSE WHILE
RINGING A BELL AND FIRING
MULTIPLE WARNING SHOTS FROM
A FRONT LOADING MUSS KET,
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS,
PREPARE TO EAT HISTORICAL
REENACTMENTS.
HERE WE GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, ALL RIGHT OKAY.
OKAY, GOT THAT RIGHT THERE.
THERE YOU GO.
JUST LIKE THAT.
SEE, I GOT MY POWDER
MAGAZINE.
ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT TYPES
OF POWDER.
OKAY.
PUT THAT IN THERE.
OKAY.
I GOT MY MUSKET.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GET IN THERE GET IN THERE.
OKAY.
FIRST WE INSERT A FARTING TO
ACCURATELY-- A FARTHING.
HEY, HEY BRITISH!
YOU, YOU THE BRITISH ARE
COMING, HERE'S A WARNING
SHOT.
OKAY.
NOW TO WARN THE NEXT TOWN
THE BRITISH, THAT THEY ARE
ON THEIR WAY, I JUST HAVE TO
RELOAD, JUST HAVE TO-- .
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: STOP, STOP, STOP!
STOP, I CERTAINLY HOPE PAUL
REVERE WAS WEARING HIS CUP.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
