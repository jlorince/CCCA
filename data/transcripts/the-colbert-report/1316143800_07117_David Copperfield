( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
LEGENDARY MAGICIAN WHO I HOPE
CAN PUT BACK TOGETHER THE INTERN
I SAW IN HALF.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID
COPPERFIELD!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WELCOME TO SHOW, SIR.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen:  NOW YOU'RE NOT
JUST ANY MAGICIAN.
ARE YOU AN ILLUSIONIST OF OVER
30 YEARS.
YOU WALKED THROUGH THE GREAT
WALL OF CHINA.
YOU FLEW OVER GRAND CANYON.
YOU WENT OVER NIAGARA IN A RAFT.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen:  YOU WERE DECLARED
A LIVING LEGEND BY THE LIBRARY
OF CONGRESS.
YOU HAVE BEEN KNIGHTED BY THE
FRENCH.
OVER 20 EMMYS.
A STAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF
FAME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU HAVE JUST
BEEN NAMED THE FIRST-EVER KING
OF MAGIC AND MAGICIAN OF THE
CENTURY BY AMERICAN SOCIETY OF
MAGICIANS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  DOES A GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY COME WITH BEING
KING OF MAGICIANS?
>> I SUPPOSE.
IT'S VERY HUMBLING THING.
I HAVE TO WORK HARDER NOW.
>> Stephen:  YOU ABSOLUTELY
DO.
AS KING OF MAGICIANS, IF THE
PEASANTS REVOLT AND THEY CUT OFF
YOUR HEAD, CAN YOU MAGICALLY PUT
IT BACK ON?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> YES, RESTIVATION PART OF MY
REPERTOIRE.
THAT'S TRUE.
I USED TO DO DEATH SAW ILLUSION
WHERE I CUT MYSELF IN HALF AND
PUT MYSELF BACK TOGETHER AND I'M
STILL HERE.
>> Stephen:  AND THE MAKEUP
HAS COVERED SCARS.
NOW, YOU HAVE ALSO WRITTEN THE
FORWARD TO A NEW BOOK PRINTED BY
THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC CALLED
REQUEST BRAIN WORKS."
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  "MIND-BENDING
SCIENCE OF WHAT YOU SEE AND HOW
YOU THINK AND YOU WHO ARE YOU."
WHAT IS SCIENCE OF HOW WE SEE,
WHAT YOU, AND WHO WE ARE?
>> I'M CONFUSED, ACTUALLY, RIGHT
NOW
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S
REALLY FOR ME ABOUT PERCEPTION.
MAGICIANS USE YOUR PERCEPTION
AND USE YOUR BRAIN TO MISDIRECT,
FOCUS ATTENTION AND MAKE MAGIC
HAPPEN, LOOK EFFORTLESS.
>> Stephen:  AS FAR AS I CAN
TELL, WHAT MAGICIANS DO IS THEY
LIE.
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IN A BAD
WAY, BUT YOU, SIR, ARE THE KING
OF LIARS, OKAY ALL RIGHT?
YOU SAID THAT WOMAN WAS SAWED IN
HALF AND SHE'S NOT SAHD IN HALF
ANYMORE.
YOU LIED TO ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  HOW IS THAT NOT
LYING?
>> IT'S NOT LYING BECAUSE I CALL
MYSELF AN ILLUSIONIST.
IT SAYS SO, ILLUSIONIST, SO I'M
AN HONEST DECEIVER.
I'M --
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE LYING.
>> I'M A LIAR.
THEREFORE, I'M NOT LYING.
>> Stephen:  SHOULD IS WHAT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW BRAIN
WORKS -- WHY DO I ENJOY THAT
YOU'RE DECEIVING ME?
( LAUGHTER )
PEOPLE PAY BIG MONEY.
YOU'RE A BIG STAR BECAUSE YOU'RE
GOOD AT DECEIVING PEOPLE.
WHY DOES THAT EXCITE US?
>> I THINK WE NEED TO DREAM.
I THINK THE PUBLIC REALLY NEEDS
TO BE TRANSPORTED.
THEY NEED COMEDY.
THEY NEED MUSIC.
THEY NEED DRAMA.
THEY NEED MOVIES AND I DO A LIVE
MOVIE EVERY NIGHT ON STAGE,
BASICALLY.
>> Stephen:  YOU DO A LIVE
MOVIE EVER NIGHT?
>> I'M BEING METAPHORICAL, BUT,
YES --
>> Stephen:  METAPHORES, ALSO
LIES.
YOU LIED TO ME.
YOU SAID MOVIE.
YOU'RE A LIAR.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, I AGREE.
>> Stephen:  AGAIN, YOU'RE A
GUEST AND I DON'T WANT TO INSULT
YOU.
>> YOU DID INSULT ME BUTHAT'S
OKAY.
I AM LYING BUT I TELL YOU I'M
LYING UPFRONT.
THEREFORE, IT'S NOT REALLY A
LIE.
>> Stephen:  YOU SAY HERE, YOU
SAY CLOSER WE LOOK THEA PEOPLE,
THE CLOSER WE LOOK AT THINGS,
LESS WE SEE.
I DON'T LOOK THEA THINGS AT ALL
( LAUGHTER )
DOES THAT MEAN I SEE EVERYTHING?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I THINK PERCEPTION IS WE TAKE
PEOPLE AND IF I FOCUS-- WHO-- IF
I HAVE SOMETHING VERY
INTERESTING OVER HERE, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO LOOK AT THIS OVER
HERE.
WHO IS YOUR HERO?
GIVE ME BIGGEST HERO YOU HAVE?
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW HIS
NAME BUT I SHAVE HIM EVERY
MORNING.
IS HE HERE?
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE
DON'T KNOW, OKAY?
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN
HAPPENING TO ME SINCE I WAS A
KID.
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MONEY.
IF I-- IF I HAVE ONE COIN IN MY
HAND, ALL RIGHT, IF I HAVE ONE
COIN IN MY HAND, THAT'S OKAY.
BUT IF I PUT ANOTHER COIN IN MY
HAND AND THEN JUST CLOSE MY
HAND.
>> TWO COINS.
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
BUT FOR SOME REASON WHEN I DO
THAT I ONLY HAVE ONE COIN LEFT
IN MY HAND
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHY-- WHY IS THAT, DAVID
COPPERFIELD?
WHAT HAS MY-- WHAT HAS MY BRAIN
BRAIN-- WHAT DOES MY BRAIN DO?
>> THIS IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE
YOU'RE THAT GOOD.
AND WHETHER YOU USE YOUR BRAIN
OR NOT, MAGIC STILL HAPPENS
BECAUSE YOU'RE THAT GOOD.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU.
I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO FOOL ME.
>> YES, BECAUSE YOU PRACTICE
THINGS TO POINT WHERE IT BECOMES
HABIT, AND THEN YOU ACTUALLY--
YOUR BRAIN ISN'T IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen:  I AGREE.
( LAUGHTER )
IS THERE SUCH A THING AS GUT
MAGIC?
>> THERE IS.
>> Stephen:  DON'T USE MY
BRAIN.
THERE'S GUT MAGIC?
WHAT IS GUT MAGIC?
>> IT'S IF I TAKE THE COIN AND
PUT IT IN THE AIR.
THAT'S GUT MAGIC.
YOU GOT A REACTION.
>> Stephen:  DAVID
COPPERFIELD, COULD YOU BE
DUMBLEDORF?
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )
LAST QUESTION, YOU MADE-- YOU
ONCE MADE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
DISAPPEAR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  IN THE 1980s.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
CAN I GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  DON'T TRY THAT
NOW.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
OR I THINK YOU MIGHT DISAPPEAR.
AND REAPPEAR MAGICALLY IN
GUANTANAMO BAY.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
DAVID COPPERFIELD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
