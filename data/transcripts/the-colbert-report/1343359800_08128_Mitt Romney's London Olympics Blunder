>> Stephen:  OF COURSE, THE OLYMPICS IS ATTRACTING VISITORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
EVEN AMERICA'S CROWNED PRINCE OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, MITT ROMNEY.
HE'S ON THE FIRST LEG OF HIS WORLD CHARM OFFENSIVE.
AND MITT REALLY GRABBED ENGLAND BY THE CRUMPET.
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE LONDON GAMES.
>> AND IN THE SHORT TIME YOU'VE BEEN HERE IN LONDON, DO THEY
LOOK READY TO YOUR EXPERIENCED EYE?
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO KNOW JUST HOW WELL IT WILL TURN OUT.
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WERE DISCONCERTING-- THE STORIES ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM
NOT HAVING ENOUGH PEOPLE.
THE SUPPOSED STRIKE OF THE IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS OFFICIALS.
THAT, OBVIOUSLY, IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH IS ENCOURAGING.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS THE SAME CLASSIC ROMNEY CHARM HE USED TO WOO HIS WIFE, ANN.
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLATES ARE BLUE, THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT ARE DISCONCERTING ABOUT YOUR HAIR.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE ) NOW, IT SURGEONS OUT, IT
SURGEONS OUT-- AND THIS WAS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED-- THAT MITT'S COMMENT THERE UPSET A FEW
PEOPLE IN ENGLAND.
NO ONE IMPORTANT.
JUST THE CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON.
WHO GOT HIS KNICKERS IN A TWIST,
AND HINGED THIS LITTLE DIDDY ABOUT ROM SNEE'S SHAKE OLYMPICS.
>> WE ARE HOLDING AN OLYMPIC GAMES IN ONE OF THE BUSIEST,
MOST ACTIVE BUSTLING CITY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
OF COURSE IT'S EASIER IF YOU HOLD THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
>> Stephen:  HEY, BUDDY,
UTAH'S NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
IT'S IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF NOWHERE.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE ) GET YOUR GEOGRAPHY STRAIGHT,
DR. WHO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU STAY STRONG, MITT.
REMEMBER, YOUR NEXT STOP IS ISRAEL.
KEEP UP THE CHARM OFFENSIVE.
(  LAUGHTER  ) I SAY YOU OPEN YOUR SPEECH TO
THEICA KINESET, AMERICA WILL ALWAYS STAND BEHIND YOU, AND SO WILL JESUS CHRIST.
NOW WHERE CAN A BOY GET SOME BABY BACK RIBS IN
