STUDIO GRAPE.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, THESE DAYS, YOU KNOW, WE
LIVE A 24/7 CONNECTED SOCIETY
THAT'S GETTING SO BUSY IT MAY
SOON UPGRADE TO 25/8.
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS, BECAUSE WE
ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR
EXPERIENCES.
AND THANKS TO ALL THIS
TECHNOLOGY, WE'VE HAVING SO MANY
MORE EXPERIENCES TO BE MADE OF.
NOWADAYS I CAN CHAT ONLINE,
LISTEN TO A PODCAST AND ORDER
GROCERIES ALL WHILE LOOKING AT
PHOTOS OF KITTEN WAR CRIMINALS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THANKS TO SOCIAL MEDIA,
ANYONE I MEET STAYS IN MY LIFE
FOREVER WHETHER I WANT THEM TO
OR NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR BRAINS AREN'T
MEANT TO STORE THAT MUCH
INFORMATION.
ACCORDING TO ANTHROPOLOGIST
ROBIN DUNBAR, THE AVERAGE BRAIN
CAN ONLY HANDLE ABOUT 150
RELATIONSHIPS.
ALTHOUGH OTHER ORGANS CAN HANDLE
MORE.
(LAUGHTER).
(APPLAUSE)
DUNBAR STUDIED THE AVERAGE SIZE
OF TRIBES AND VILLAGES
THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND
DISCOVERED THAT UNTIL RECENTLY
MOST CONTAINED ABOUT 150 PEOPLE
WHO WERE EASY TO REMEMBER
BECAUSE YOU WERE RELATED TO THEM
OR MARRIED TO THEM OR BOTH.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THERE IS NOW A WAY WE CAN
HANDLE ALL THE DATA THAT MODERN
SOCIETY CRAMS INTO OUR SENSE
HOLES AND IT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEAD IN THE CLOUDS.
FOLKS, TO DEAL WITH INFORMATION
OVERLOAD, THE HUMAN BRAIN USES
SOMETHING CALLED TRANSACTIVE
MEMORY, RELYING ON FRIENDS AND
FAMILY TO REMEMBER THINGS YOU
DON'T HAVE SPACE FOR.
LIKE WHEN A HUSBAND REMEMBERS TO
PAY THE ELECTRIC BILL WHILE THE
WIFE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING HE'S
DONE WRONG FOR THE PAST 10
YEARS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW OUR BRAINS ARE APPLYING THE
SAME TECHNIQUE ONLINE.
IT SEEMS THAT BETSY SPARROW,
COLUMBIA RESEARCHER AND
DECEMBERERIST SONG LYRIC,
RECENTLY PUBLISHED A REPORT
CALLED "MEMORY IN THE AGE OF
GOOGLE."
SUBJECTS IN THE STUDY WERE ASKED
TO TYPE FACTS INTO A COMPUTER
SUCH AS AN OSTRICH'S EYE IS
BIGGER THAN ITS BRAIN.
NOW, TO DETERMINE...
(LAUGHTER).
HOW THE INTERNET AFFECTS OUR
MEMORY, HALF WERE TOLD THOSE
FACTS WERE SAVED IN THE COMPUTER
AND THE OTHER HALF WERE TOLD
THEY WOULD NOT BE SAVED.
THE RESULTS WERE FASCINATING BUT
I DIDN'T COMMIT THEM TO MEMORY
BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD ALWAYS
LOOK THEM UP ON YOUTUBE.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> WHEN PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN
LOOK UP STUFF ONLINE OVER AND
OVER AGAIN THAT'S CONTINUALLY
ACCESSIBLE THEN THEY WON'T
REMEMBER IT AS WELL.
>> Stephen: THIS MAKES SENSE.
IF SOMETHING'S ONLINE I DON'T
BOTHER REMEMBERING IT.
AS I EXPLAINED TO MY STAFF, I AM
CONSTANTLY FORGETTING WHAT NAKED
WOMEN LOOK LIKE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND NOBODY...
(APPLAUSE).
AND, FOLKS, NOBODY REMEMBERS
PHONE NUMBERS ANYMORE.
IF I WANT TO CALL MY NANA, I
JUST TAP HER NAME ON MY PHONE
AND ALL OF HER INFORMATION IS
THERE N THERE?
>> HELLO?
STEPHEN?
>> Stephen: SEE?
IT'S THAT EASY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
AND YET WE STUBBORNLY INSIST ON
KEEPING DATA IN THE OLD SKULL
DRIVE.
THIS THING IS TOTALLY
UNRELIABLE.
FOR SOME REASON IT REMEMBERS ALL
THE WORDS TO "MANDY" BUT DOESN'T
REMEMBER MY ASSISTANT'S NAME.
(LAUGHTER)
THANKFULLY, COMPANIES LIKE
APPLE, GOOGLE, AND MICROSOFT
OFFER REMOTE COMPUTER STORAGE SO
WE CAN ACCESS ALL INFORMATION
WHEREVER AND WHEREVER WE WANT.
IT'S CALLED THE CLOUD.
AND THEY'VE ALREADY LAUNCHED A
MASSIVE VIRAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN
IN THE SKIES.
(LAUGHTER)
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THAT COST.
WELL, FOLKS, I'M IN.
I'VE ALREADY UPWEBBED EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER KNOWN INTO THE CLOUD.
PARENTS' NAMES, DOG'S
PRESCRIPTIONS, PIZZA THAWING
INSTRUCTIONS, BASEBALL STATS,
EVEN MY DEEPEST, DARKEST
SECRETS.
NOW, THE ONLY THING...
(LAUGHTER).
THE ONLY THING MY BRAIN HAS TO
DO IS KEEP MY EYEBALLS FROM
FALLING BACKWARDS.
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN
HERE IS SAFELY STORED IN THE
CLOUD.
AND I CAN ACCESS IT AT ANY TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M HUNGRY RIGHT
NOW SO I SHOULD LOOK UP MY
FAVORITE FOOD AND I WILL JUST
TAP IN HERE... AND I APPEAR NOT
TO BE CONNECTED TO MY WI-FI.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, WHAT WAS THE PASSWORD?
IT WAS... RIGHT, IT'S MY
FAVORITE FOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
FINE, I'LL JUST RESET THE
PASSWORD.
AND LET'S SEE HERE.
UM... I NEED TO GIVE IT THE CITY
OF MY BIRTH.
(LAUGHTER)
IS QWERTY A CITY?
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S SEE.
I'LL JUST TRY... WAIT, I'LL TRY
ANOTHER HINT.
WHAT IS MY MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME?
WAIT A SECOND!
MY MOTHER WAS A MAID?
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.
OKAY, JUST DON'T PANIC, WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS.
UM... I MAY BE JUST AN EMPTY
FLESH TERMINAL RELIANT ON
TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL MY IDEAS,
MEMORIES, AND RELATIONSHIPS BUT
I AM CONFIDENT THAT ALL OF THAT
EVERYTHING THAT MAKES ME A
UNIQUE HUMAN BEING IS STILL OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE.
SAFE IN A THEORETICAL STORAGE
SPACE OWNED BY GIANT
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THAT... HELP ME OUT?
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR
