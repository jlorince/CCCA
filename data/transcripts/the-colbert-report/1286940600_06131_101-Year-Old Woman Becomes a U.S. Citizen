NATION, NATION, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENERGY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADORATION.
I NEED IT BECAUSE I AM SICK TO
DEATH OF ALL THE PEOPLE OUT
THERE WHO WOULD OPEN OUR BORDERS
TO EVERY TOMAS, DIEGO AND HARRY
WHO WANTS IN.
BY THE WAY, THAT'S HARRY SPELLED
WITH A "J."
( LAUGHTER )
HARRY.
I SAY, IF YOU WANT TO BECOME AN
AMERICAN, YOU DO IT THE LEGAL
WAY.
AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE YOUR
GRANDMOTHER PLACE A FAKE BIRTH
ANNOUNCEMENT IN A HAWAIIAN
NEWSPAPER.
THAT IS WHY, FOLKS...
( APPLAUSE )
I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS.
JIM.
>> AFTER 101 YEARS, EULALIA
GARCIA MATUREY WILL BECOME A
U.S. CITIZEN.
IN 1909 MATUREY WAS JUST A BABY
WHEN SHE CROSSED INTO THE UNITED
STATES FROM MEXICO.
>> Stephen: EVEN WORSE, ALL
SHE COULD SAY WAS GA GA GOO GOO.
SPEAK ENGLISH!
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, EULALIA HAS SURVIVED TWO
HUSBANDS DURING HER LONG PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP, SO, FELLAS, IF
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREEN CARD,
SHE'S SINGLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO SHE'S BEEN NATURALIZED, AND
AS A LEGAL CENTENARIAN AMERICAN,
SHE IS NOW ELIGIBLE TO HAVE HER
MIRTH DAY ANNOUNCED BY WILLARD
SCOTT INSTEAD OF BY A GIANT BABY
ON SABADO GIGANTE.
OKAY.
SO WITH THIS EXAMPLE, CAN WE
JUST PUT TO REST ONCE AND FOR
ALL THIS MYTH THAT OUR
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN?
EULALIA HERE PROVES THAT IF YOU
FOLLOW THE RULES, THERE IS A
LEGAL PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.
AND IT TAKES LESS THAN 102
YEARS.
NOW SHE'S ELIGIBLE TO WORK HERE
LEGALLY, PICKING CROPS, PAVING
ROADS, DOING CONSTRUCTION.
NO MORE RACING AWAY WITH HER
OXYGEN TANK WHEN GRIGGS PULLS UP
IN FRONT OF THE HOME DEPOT.
SO CONGRATULATIONS, EULALIA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES.
AND NOW THAT THEY WON'T BE
ANCHOR BABIES, FEEL FREE TO
START PUM
