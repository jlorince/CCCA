(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH!
WOW.
YOU GUYS DO THAT SO WELL VICTIM
YOU DO IT TWICE.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THE BITTER PARTISAN
WRANGLING IN WASHINGTON OVER OUR
NATION'S FINANCES HAS HIT ROCK
BOTTOM.
THE PRESIDENT IS BLAMING HOUSE
REPUBLICANS.
JOHN BOEHNER IS POINTING FINGERS
AT THE PRESIDENT AND JOE BIDEN
IS LOCKED IN THE HEATED BAD L
WITH A VEND MAGAZINE THAT WON'T
RELEASE HIS TEDDY GRAM.
BUT LAST NIGHT IN HIS TELEVISED
PRESPONSE TO JOHN BOEHNER, THE
PRESIDENT STOOPED TO A NEW, NEW
LOW.
>> A PREDECESSOR OF MINE MAID
THE CASE FOR A BALANCED APPROACH
BY SAYING THIS: "WOULD YOU
RATHER REDUCE DEFICITS AND
INTEREST RATES FROM RAISING
REVENUE FROM THOSE WHO ARE NOT
NOW PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OR
BOLD YOU RATHER ACCEPT LARGER
BUDGET DEFICITS, HIGHER INTEREST
RATES AND UNEMPLOYMENT?"
THOSE WORDS WERE SPOKEN BY
RONALD REAGAN.
>> Stephen: HOW DARE YOU USE
THE "R" WORD?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WORD BELONGS TO US!
(LAUGHTER)
WE CONSERVATIVE AMERICANS CAN
SAY REAGAN TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE
WE USE IT AFFECTIONATELY.
I SAY IT ALL THE TIME.
WHAT UP MY GIPPER?
GIPPA PLEASE.
ALL THE GIPPERS IN THE HOUSE SAY
"NO TAXES!"
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT OBAMA
IS PLAYING THE REAGAN CARD.
SHE'S JUST TRYING TO SHORE UP
ONE OF THE LEFT'S LONG
DISCREDITED IDEAS: THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT.
TO THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WE
ELECTED LAST NOVEMBER, THEY SAW
THIS FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP
COMING.
THEY TOLD US THAT THE GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T WORK AND AS SOON AS THEY
GOT INTO OFFICE THEY PROVED IT!
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, SINCE NOBODY ELSE HAS GOT
THE BALLS TO CALL THIS ONE, I
WILL.
CONGRESS WILL NOT RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING BY NEXT TUESDAY AND
AMERICA WILL DEFAULT!
THAT WILL WRAP THINGS UP FOR
THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT IN
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.
(LAUGHTER)
HEY... HEY, HEY, AMERICA HAD A
GOOD RUN.
WE HAD A VERY GOOD RUN.
LOOKING BACK, WE MAY HAVE STAYED
IN THE GAME TOO LONG.
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT AFTER
THE MOON LANDING OR WHEN THE
TINY GIRL STUCK THE LANDING WITH
A BROKEN ANKLE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE DEADLINE'S
NOT UNTIL AUGUST 2 SO IT'S STILL
GOT A WHOLE WEEK TO FINISH OFF
AMERICA'S BUCKET LIST.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR INSTANCE, BEFORE OUR SOCIETY
COLLAPSES INTO ROVING
CANNIBALISTIC MOTORCYCLE GANGS
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY BUBBLE
TEA.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOKS FUN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THOSE TASTY LITTLE BALLS THERE.
OH, ALSO, WE SHOULD INVADE IRAN.
WE KNOW IT WON'T BE A QUAGMIRE
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO BE OUT BY
NEXT TUESDAY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND WE SHOULD FINALLY JUST DO IT
WITH CANADA.
(LAUGHTER)
THE TENSION HAS BEEN BUILDING
FOR YEARS.
I'M TALKING CRAZY LAST NIGHT ON
EARTH GRABBING BORDERS SLAPPING
ROCKIES HALF IN FRENCH NO EYE
CONTACT EATING POUTIN OUT OF
EACH OTHER'S GREAT LAKES
NASTINESS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT WAS A CROWD PLEASER.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW IT.
LET'S FINALLY GET A TATTOO.
MAYBE A CHINESE CHARACTER ON
FLORIDA.
(LAUGHTER)
IT WILL BE A GREAT WAY TO START
LEARNING THE
