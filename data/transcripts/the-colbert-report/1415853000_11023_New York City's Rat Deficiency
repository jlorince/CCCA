(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ON THISCRISP FALL NIGHT
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HOPETHAT I'VE MADE
THIS CLEAR OVER THE YEARS, BUT ILOVE NEW YORK CITY.
BECAUSE EVERYTHING, EVERYTHINGIN NEW YORK IS BIGGER.
WE'VE GOT THE TALLEST BUILDINGS,THE RICHEST BANKERS, THE
RACIST-EST CABBIES.
IN NO OTHER CITY DO THE DRIVERSEVEN KNOW THE PROPER ETHNIC SLUR
FOR PEOPLE FROM MALTA.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S FEATHERHEAD, BY THE WAY.
BUT THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT NEWYORK THAT IS NOT AS BIG AS WE
THOUGHT.
>> IT APPEARS THAT A PARTICULARDEMOGRAPHIC IN NEW YORK HAS BEEN
EXPONENTIALLY OVERESTIMATED--THE RAT POPULATION.
COMMON LORE STATES THERE ARE ASMANY RATS AS HUMANS IN NEW YORK
CITY, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OFEIGHT MILLION.
HOWEVER A STATISTICIAN FROMCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SAYS THERE
ARE REALLY JUST TWO MILLION RATSIN THE BIG APPLE.
>> Stephen: NEW YORK HAS ONLYTWO MILLION RATS?
I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE FINDING OUTNEW YORK ONLY HAS TWO MILLION
ORIGINAL RAY'S PIZZAS.
( LAUGHTER )SOME COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
BRAINIAC ARRIVED AT THISESTIMATE BY EXTRAPOLATING THE
NUMBER OF RAT-OCCUPIED LOTS INTHE CITY USING COMPLAINTS FROM
THE PUBLIC ABOUT RAT SIGHTINGS.
APPARENTLY, SOME NEW YORKERS ARESTILL UNJADED ENOUGH TO ALERT
SOMEONE WHEN THEY SEE A RAT.
( LAUGHTER )I BET IT'S THE DAMN
FEATHERHEADS.
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL
NEW YORKERS WHEN I SAY, "STEP ITUP, RATS."
TWO MILLION?
THOSE ARE CHICAGO NUMBERS.
COME ON!
THIS IS NEW YORK CITY.
WE HAVE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD.
THIS IS THE CITY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YOU HEAR THAT?
WE ARE THE CITY THAT NEVERSLEEPS BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID THAT
IF WE NOD OFF, A RAT WILL BIRTHITS YOUNG IN OUR OPEN MOUTHS.
WHERE DID YOU RATS GO, NEWJERSEY?
WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER AND YOUHAVE A NICE YARD WITH PLENTY OF
SPACE TO EAT YOUR YOUNG?
( LAUGHTER )YOU GOTTA STAY IN THE CITY.
THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS.
THAT'S WHERE THE CULTURE IS.
YOU CAN INFEST THE MOMA.
YOU CAN INFEST THE MET.
THERE ARE WAY BETTER RESTAURANTICE MACHINES FOR YOU TO POOP IN.
SO GET IT TOGETHER, RATS, OR-- ICAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS--
WE MAY STOP LEAVING MOUNTAINS OFLOOSELY BAGGED GARBAGE ON THE
SIDEWALK FOR YOU TO FEAST ON.
