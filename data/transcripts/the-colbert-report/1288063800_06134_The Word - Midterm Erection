THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY.
I HOPE THE REPUBLICANS PULL OUT
ALL THE STOPS, FOLKS.
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T ELECT
STRONGER LEADERS, AMERICA MAY
SOON GO THE WAY OF ROME, ONCE
THE HEBB OF THE GREATEST EMPIRE
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN, NOW
IT'S BASICALLY DETROIT MADE OUT
OF MARBLES.
( LAUGHTER )
LUCKILY THERE IS A CLEAR WAY FOR
AMERICA TO PICK THE STRONGEST
LEADERS, AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S "WORD."
MID-TERM ERECTION.
NATION, THESE MID-TERMS ARE
ALREADY HISTORIC THANKS TO THE
LARGE NUMBER OF PROMINENT FEMALE
CANDIDATES OR CANIDETTES.
THESE WOMEN AND THEIR SUPPORTERS
HAVE COME UP WITH PHRASE THAT
PERFECTLY CAPTURES WHAT AMERICA
NEEDS FROM ITS LEADERS.
>> POLITICIANS WHO ARE IN OFFICE
TODAY, YOU NEED MAN UP.
>> MAN UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO.
>> I HAVE TWO WORDS FOR YOU, MAN
UP.
>> MAN UP, HARRY REID.
>> MAN UP.
>> MAN UP.
>> MAN UP.
>> YEAH, GUYS, MAN UP.
STOP ACTING LIKE WEAK,
SPINELESS, UNFIT FOR LEADERSHIP
WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE OF A MAN
IS.
EVERYONE, EVERYONE LIKES TO SAY
THAT IF WOMEN RULED THE WORLD
THERE WOULD BE NO MORE WAR AND
THAT ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE
WORLD WOULD BE FED, AND IT IS SO
REFRESHING TO KNOW THESE WOMEN
DON'T WANT THAT EITHER.
PLUS A WOMAN TELLING HER MALE
OPPONENT TO MAN UP IS JUST GOOD
POLITICS BECAUSE, FOLKS, IT
WORKS.
( LAUGHTER )
LISTEN TO HOW DELAWARE'S
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL DEBALLED HER
HEAVILY FAVORED PRIMARY OPPONENT
CASSEL.
>> MIKE, THIS IS NOT A BAKEOFF.
GET YOUR MAN PANTS ON.
>> Stephen: YEAH, MIKE, GET
YOUR MAN PANTS ON.
WELL SAID.
AND TRUE.
BECAUSE ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN TO A
BAKEOFF KNOWS YOU DON'T WEAR
PANTS.
( LAUGHTER )
SO WE NEED LEADERS WHO ARE READY
TO MAN UP, AND, FOLKS, LET'S BE
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THESE LADIES
MEAN.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PART OF AN
AMERICAN MAN THAT GOES UP.
THE PENIS PART.
SIZE MATTERS.
I MEAN, THESE LADY POLITICIANS
ARE BASICALLY SAYING IT'S TIME
OUR DEMOCRACY DITCHED THE BALLOT
BOX IN FAVOR OF THE MEASURING
STICK.
AND I AGREE.
IN THIS ELECTION, THERE'S ONLY
ONE POLL THAT MATTERS, ONLY ONE
LEVER WE SHOULD BE CRANK BEHIND
THAT CURTAIN.
VOTE FOR WHICHEVER CANDIDATE HAS
A ROCK, HARD, LOAD-BEARING DON
QUIXOTE THE LENGTH OF A CHAMPION
SUMMER SQUASH, THE GIRTH OF A
COST COCAN OF CHICKPEAS AND AN
IRON CORE SO DENSE IT THROWS OFF
COMPASSES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND FAILING THAT WE SHOULD JUST
ELECT CANDIDATES WITH GIANT
BALLS.
LIKE THESE WOMEN.
WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SUGGEST
