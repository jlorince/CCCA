( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE COCHAIR OF THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION.
COCHAIR-- THEY GET ALL THAT MONEY AND HAVE TO SHARE A CHAIR?
PLEASE WELCOME MELINDA GATES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, MELINDA GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO YOU HAVE BACK.
>> LIKEWISE.
>> Stephen:  NOW AND YOUR HUSBAND, BILL-- HOW IS BILL?
>> HE'S TERRIFIC.
>> Stephen:  PLEASE TELL HIM TO STOP BY MORE OFTEN.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen:  ONCE WOULD BE GOOD.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW YOU'RE-- YOU'RE BOTH TRUSTEES OF THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION.
YOU HAVE, THROUGH YOUR WORK IN IMPOVERISHED COUNTRIES, YOU HAVE SAVED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IF
NOT MILLIONS OF LIVES.
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE A CHUMP FOR NOT HAVING-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU FEEL LIKE A SNUCK OF
SCHMUCK FOR NOT HAVING A SUPERPAC.
>> I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THINGS BEYOND ONE ELECTION
SEASON SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE MONEY WE SPEND, PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
Q. COULD LAND LIKE A TON OFBRICKS ON CON HAND PICK THE PERSON.
>> BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN DOINGA THAT.
I'M INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH WHICHEVER ADMINISTRATION GETS ELECTED.
>> Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND, BUT YOU COULD DECIDE WHICH ONE IT IS.
NOW, I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER-- AND I DON'T MAKE THIS
OFFER TO EVERYBODY-- I WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY.
I HAVE A 501 C-4, WHICH IS CALLED A SPOOKY PAC.
PEOPLE DON'T GET TON WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM.
YOU GIVE ME $100 MILLION, AND NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.
>> THAT COULD BE A LITTLE PROBLEM, BECAUSE WE LIKE TO BE VERY, VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT ALL
THE WORK WE DO WITH OUR PARTNERS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
>> Stephen:  NO ONE WILL KNOW YOU WERE NOT TRANSPARENT BECAUSE I'LL EDIT THIS OUT OF THE INTERVIEW.
>> THAT WILL BE CONVENIENT.
>> Stephen:  IS THAT A YES?
>> NO, THAT'S A NO.
>> Stephen:  GOOD BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY THAT I SAID NO.
BUT YOU MEAN NO, RIGHT?
>> I MEAN NO.
>> Stephen:  GOOD, KEEP THAT UP.
( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY, NOW, AS I SAID, YOU DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE IN THESE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
SELL ME ON HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.
WHY?
( LAUGHTER ) WHY DO YOU DO THIS?
>> BECAUSE I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE THAT CAME FROM MICROSOFT CAN BE
USED FOR INCREDIBLE IMPACT.
I MEAN, WE ARE SAVE, PEOPLE'S LIVES BY MAKING SURE THEY GET GREAT VACCINATIONS OR BED NETS
SO THEY TONIGHT GET MALARIA.
IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE,
AND PEOPLE STAY ALIVE BECAUSE OF THAT.
>> Stephen:  YOU'VE GOT A NEW CHARITABLE HOB HORSE YOU'RE ON,
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES AS STOPPING
PEOPLE'S LIVES FROM EXISTING.
YOU WANT TO PROVIDE FAMILY PLANNING FOR 120 MILLION MEN AND WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD.
>> RIGHT ( APPLAUSE ).
( CHEERS )
>> Stephen:  WHY?
WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO?
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, WHAT WE KNOW IS IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS AND YOU LET WOMEN DECIDE WHEN AND IF THEY
WANT TO HAVE A CHILD, THEY WILL ACTUALLY SPACE THE BIRTH OF THEIR CHILDREN.
AND WHAT THEY WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM IN THESE COUNTRIES IS, "THEN I CAN FEED
MY CHILDREN AND I CAN GET MY CHILDREN ON A PATH TO GETTING THEM EDUCATED.
AND GUESS WHAT?
OUR FAMILY CAN BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT." AND ULTIMATELY THEY GET OFF OF AID AND BUILD HEALTHY
COMMUNITIES AND HEALTHY FAMILIES.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> Stephen:  IT'S A WILDLY CONTROVERSIAL STANCE BECAUSE YOU
KNOW FROM THE CULTURE WARS IN THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF CONTRACEPTION, YOU ARE
AUTOMATICALLY A SHUT.
( LAUGHTER ) OKAY.
AREN'T YOU AFRAID THAT THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION WILL BE THOUGHT OF AS A SHUT FACTORY?
( LAUGHTER ) IT IS CONTROVERSIAL.
>>UN, WE'VE MADE IT CONTROVERSIAL IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE.
IN FACT, 90% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY FIND CONTRACEPTIVES MORALLY ACCEPTABLE.
BUT BECAUSE WE'VE MADE IT CONTROVERSIAL, IT'S COME OFF THE
GLOBAL HEALTH AGENDA SO IT MEANS 200 MILLION WOMEN THAT SAY THEY WANT ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTIVES,
THINGS THAT WE USE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY DON'T HAVE THEM.
AND GUESS WHAT?
WOMEN DIE IF THEY CAN'T SPACE THEIR BIRTHS, IF THEY HAVE CHILDREN TOO CLOSE TOGETHER OR
THEY'RE TOO YOUNG WHEN THEY HAVE A CHILD.
THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE.
( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELL, HERE'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS -- HERE'S ONE OF
THE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR INITIATIVE IS THAT YOU AND I ARE BOTH CATHOLICS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
HOW-- HOW CAN YOU PUT YOUR SOUL IN-- IN MORTAL PERIL BY GOING AGAINST THE CHURCH?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW MUCH WE IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
ACTUALLY HAVE ALIKE.
THE SOCIAL JUSTICE MISSION OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.
THE WAY THEY SERVE THE POOR AROUND THE WORLD.
AND SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WANTS TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WOMEN
KNOW ABOUT LOTS OF METHODS.
THE RHYTHM METHOD IS THE ONE THEY ACTUALLY PREACH IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ONE METHOD.
I THINK WE SHOULD LET WOMEN CHOOSE THAT.
OR CHOOSE A MODERN METHOD.
AND AS LONG AS BEE DO BOTH, I THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER.
>> Stephen:  WHAT ABOUT ABSTINENCE.
IT'S VERY COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT COSTS NOTHING AND IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE.
SO IT'S VERY FOLLOW-EQUAL.
( LAUGHTER ).
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THIS DONE?
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GUYS NEED?
>> WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY LARGE FAMILY PLANNING SUMMIT IN THE U.K. JULY 11 AND
RAISE $4 BILLION FROM BOTH DONOR NATIONS AND DEVELOPING WORLD NATIONS PUT SOMETHING SKIN IN
THE GAME AND SAYING THIS IS ON THE AGENDA AGAIN.
WE'RE GOING TO GET LOT OF CONTRACEPTIVES OUT TO FAMILIES.
>> Stephen:  BUT IF THIS SUCCEEDS, OKAY, AND IF YOU GOT CONTRACEPTION TO EVERYBODY AND
IT'S A ROARING SUCCESS, ISN'T THERE A DANGER THAT THERE WILL STOP BEING POOR PEOPLE AND
YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO?
( LAUGHTER )
>> I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY.
AND I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT WE'RE FINDING OUT ABOUT AID AND FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
IS THAT WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE ON A PATH TO SELF-SUSTAINABILITY,
THEY WILL LIFT THEMSELVES UP.
IF YOU GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TOOL,
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THIS NEW TRAJECTORY IN LIFE
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING THIS EMERGING MIDDLE CLASS IN AFRICA.
AFRICA IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHEN I TRAVELED THERE 10 YEARS AGO.
AND I SEE THE HOPE THAT'S COMING THERE AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE
SURE WE'RE PART OF GIVING PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO LIFT THEMSELVES UP.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NOT GIVING
MONEY TO MY SUPERPAC.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen:  MELINDA GATES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
