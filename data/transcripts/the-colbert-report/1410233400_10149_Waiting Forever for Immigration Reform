NATION, EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKAMERICA IS BEING INFILTRATED BY
LOS LATINOS IMMIGRANTES.
IN FACT, DID YOU KNOW THAT EVENTHIS SENTENCE STARTED WITH AN
UPSIDE-DOWN QUESTION MARK?
THANKFULLY, HOUSEREPUBLICANS HAVE DONE SOMETHING
TO COMBAT THIS MENACE BY DOINGNOTHING.
BUT BACK IN JUNE, THEPRESIDENT THREATENED TO UNDO
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE NEVER DONE.
>> SO, WHILE I WILL CONTINUE TOPUSH HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO DROP
THE EXCUSES AND ACT, AMERICACANNOT WAIT FOREVER FOR THEM TO
ACT.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: NO, THEY'RE
WAITING FOREVER -- FOR YOU TOTALK.
>> THAT'S WHY TODAY -- I'MBEGINNING A NEW EFFORT TO FIX AS
MUCH OF OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEMAS I CAN ON MY OWN -- WITHOUT
CONGRESS.
>> STEPHEN: GOING IT ALONE?
THAT COMPLETELY UNDERMINES OURCONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF CHECKS,
BALANCES, AND CRIPPLINGDEADLOCKS.
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY RELIEFWHEN I SAW OUR WAFFLER-IN-CHIEF
FOLD LIKE A BREAKFAST TACO.
(LAUGHTER)JIM?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HITTING THEPAUSE BUTTON ON IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
>> THE PRESIDENT NOW HOLDING OFFON ANY ACTION TO FIX THE
IMMIGRATION CRISIS UNTIL AFTERTHE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
>> I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIMEEVEN AS WE'RE GETTING ALL OF OUR
DUCKS IN A ROW FOR THE EXECUTIVEACTION, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE T'S ARE CROSSED AND THE I'SARE DOTTED.
>> STEPHEN: YES, HE JUST WANTSTO CROSS THE
T'S, DOT THE I'S, AND TILDE THEN'S.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: NATURALLY, THE
PRESIDENT'S DECISION HAS LEFTHISPANIC SUPPORTERS ASKING,
SEÃ‘OR OBAMA, DONDE ESTAN LOSCOJONES?
(LAUGHTER)AS ONE LATINA ACTIVIST SAID, "A
GUY SAYS HE'S GOING TO PROPOSE,AND THEN HE DECIDES HE'S GOING
TO DELAY AND NOT PROPOSE FOR ACOUPLE OF MONTHS.
SO YOU GO, 'O.K., I WANT ATWO-CARAT RING NOW INSTEAD OF A
ONE-CARAT RING."
ONE CARAT, TWO CARAT.
WE DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED.
WE JUST WANT SOMEONE TO PICK OURCARROTS.
(LAUGHTER)AND I'M MAD THAT OBAMA IS
DELAYING IMMIGRATION REFORMBECAUSE HE STOLE THAT IDEA FROM
THE REPUBLICANS!
THEY'VE HAD THE IDEA OF PUTTINGOFF DOING SOMETHING ABOUT
IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR A DECADE!
>> THE POINT IS THAT WHAT WENEED TO DO, MOVE FORWARD WITH
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> WE'VE GOT TO DO ACOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
PLAN.
>> WE'VE GOT SOME PLANS TOUNVEIL SOME CHANGES TO THE LEGAL
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM OF THISCOUNTRY.
>> WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE ADOCUMENT SOON ABOUT OUR WAY
FORWARD ON IMMIGRATION.
>> WE'RE OPEN TO LOOKING ATIMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> IMMIGRATION REFORM WILL BE MYTOP PRIORITY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
OBLIGATION TO ADDRESS A FEDERALISSUE FROM A FEDERAL STANDPOINT.
>> LET US HAVE A SERIOUS, CIVILAND CONCLUSIVE DEBATE SO THAT
YOU CAN PASS AND I CAN SIGNCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
INTO LAW.
>> THE DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATIONREFORM HAS REACHED A TIME OF
DECISION.
>> WE MUST PASS COMPREHENSIVEIMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> IMMIGRATION REFORM IS A VERYIMPORTANT AGENDA ITEM.
>> STEPHEN: YES,A MUY IMPORTANTE "AGENDA" ITEM.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T DO PASSIMMIGRATION REFORM.
THAT WOULD TAKE IT "OFF" THEAGENDA.
BUT DON'T LOSE HOPE, IMMIGRANTS,
JUST BECAUSE OUR LEADERS ARETELLING YOU TO WAIT TILL NEXT
YEAR DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'THAPPEN, AS LONG AS YOU JUST WAIT
TILL NEXT YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)RIGHT, JOHN BOEHNER, FROM LAST
WEEK?
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S APOSSIBILITY THAT CONGRESS COULD
TAKE THIS ISSUE UP NEXT YEAR.
>> STEPHEN: NEXT YEAR!
GUARANTEED!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NEXT YEAR, GUARANTEED
THAT IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
AND BOEHNER GETS THE IMMIGRANTEXPERIENCE, BECAUSE HE REMEMBERS
HOW MANY YEARS IT TOOK CONGRESSTO WELCOME HIS COMMUNITY OF
TANGELO-AMERICANS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT IF FOR SOME REASON THIS
LATEST PROMISE ISN'T ENOUGH TOCONVINCE THE HISPANISH
COMMUNITY, I SAY WE DO SOMETHINGMORE REALISTIC THAN TRYING TO
PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM -- BUILDA TIME MACHINE.
THAT WAY, PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURECAN COME BACK AND ASSURE US
PRESENT DAY AMERICANS THATIMMIGRATION REFORM DOES
EVENTUALLY HAPPEN. WITH THAT INMIND, JOINING ME NOW, LIVE FROM
THE DISTANT TOMORROW, PLEASEWELCOME.
