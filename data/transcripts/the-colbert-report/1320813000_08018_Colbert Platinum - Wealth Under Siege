WHATEVER IT IS YOU GO DO.
(LAUGHTER)
MOVING ON.
FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE IS
A WAR ON THE WELLNY THIS COUNTRY
AND THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THE
RICH PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE POLO
NOW.
AND THINGS ARE STARTING TO GET
ROUGH, FOLKS, MASSIVE
DEMONSTRATIONS, UPRISINGS BY THE
DOWNTRODDEN HAVE HAPPENED ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY WITH
UNREASONABLE DEMANDS FOR
ECONOMIC EQUALITY AND THREATS OF
CANNIBALISM.
THEY KNOW WE'RE DELICIOUS!
WHO TOLD?
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
IM'M MARBLED.
I SPEND ALL DAY AT MY DESK
EATING BEER AND DRINKING CORN
AND BEING MASSAGED BY WOMEN.
I'M HUMAN KOBE BEEF.
IT'S TIME FOR A SPECIAL
EMERGENCY ININSTALLMENT OF
COLBERT PLATINUM, WEALTH UNDER
SIEGE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, REMEMBER,... HE GREW A
BEARD.
REMEMBER THIS SEGMENT IS FOR
PLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY SO IF
YOU'RE NOT... IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A 52-INCH PLASM PLA SCREEN ON
YOUR A.T.M. TO WATCH YOUR BANK
BALANCE, WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG
AND WATCH SOME EXTREME
COUPONING.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, LISTEN UP PLATINUM NATION.
THE BARBARIANS ARE AT THE GATED
COMMUNITIES.
WE MUST BE READY TO FLEE AT A
MOMENT'S NOTICE BECAUSE THAT'S
WHY I WAS RECENTLY COMFORTED BY
A FULL-PAGE AD IN THIS
INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.
I READ IN THE MY DENTIST'S
OFFICE WHICH IS ALSO A YACHT.
NOW, THE GOOD PEOPLE HERE...
IT'S A FULL PAGE ADD.
THE GOOD PEOPLE OVER AT HAAR
GRAVE CUSTOM YACHTS HAVE OUR
BACKS.
THE AD READS "WE USED TO SELL
YACHTS AS LUXURY ITEMS.
IN TODAY'S WORLD THEY ARE REALLY
A NECESSITY."
(LAUGHTER)
"BECAUSE SUCCESSFUL SUPREME NOW
BECOME THE TARGET!"
YES, THE YACHT IS A NECESSITY
FOR ESCAPE.
I FORONE CANNOT IMAGINE FLEEING
THE COLLAPSE OF SOCIETY IN A
BOAT WITHOUT AN ON BOARD
INFINITY POOL!
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DODD?
GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE WATER
TO SWIM?
AND THESE DAYS WHO CAN YOU TRUST
IF NOT YOUR YACHT DEALER?
AS THE AD SAYS, IF YOU EVER GET
DISCOURAGED AND THINK NOBODY IN
THE WORLD CARES ABOUT YOU AND
YOUR DREAMS, TRUST ME, THE
BOATING INDUSTRY DOES.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, BOATING INDUSTRY, YOU HAD ME
AT "AHOY."
OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO
YOU GET TO YOUR ESCAPE YACHT
THROUGH THE ANGRY MARAUDERS?
PLATINUM NATION, I RECOMMEND THE
WORLD'S MOST LUXURIOUS ARMORED
LIMOUSINE FROM LONDON LUXURY
RETAILER MILLION DOLLAR DANDY, A
NAME SYNONYMOUS WITH TOUGHNESS.
THIS $1.5 MILLION S.U.V. IS
PACKED WITH SECURITY FEATURES
LIKE NIGHT VISION CAMERAS AND
OXYGEN TANKS AND IS BUILT TO
WITHSTAND GUNSHOTS FOR 24 HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS THE PERFECT VEHICLE FOR
ANYONE WITH ENEMIES ANGRY ENOUGH
TO FIRE BULLETS MEASURABLE WITH
A DAY PLANNER.
(LAUGHTER)
AND DURING THAT 24 HOUR HELL
RAIN OF GUN FIRE YOU WILL LIVE
LIKE A KING BECAUSE IT COMES
EQUIPPED WITH LUSH CARPETS, A
DRINKS CABINET AND A CIGAR
HUMIDOR WHICH, SINCE THE LIMO
HAS NO BATHROOM, WILL EVENTUALLY
DOUBLE AS A POOP HUMIDOR.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU WANT TO KEEP IT MOIST.
YOU WANT TO KEEP IT HUMID.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT... HOW?
HOW, YOU ASK?
YOU GET FROM YOUR HOME TO YOUR
VEHICLE WITHOUT BEING DETECTED
BY THE HOARDS OF MUD MEN?
WELL, JUST MAKE YOUR HOME A
VEHICLE LIKE THE $3 MILLION FROM
MARCHY MOBILE.
IT'S LIKE A STORM TROOPER BANG
ADD WINNEBAGO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL LINES.
FOLKS, THIS HIGH-END CAMPER
INCLUDES EVERYTHING YOU NEED: A
MASTER BEDROOM WITH A RAINFALL
SHOWER BECAUSE HOW ELSE WOULD
YOU EXPERIENCE RAINFALL WHEN
YOU'RE CAMPING?
A LAVISH POP-UP ROOF TERRACE SO
YOU CAN STILL LOOK DOWN ON
PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND A WORKING FIREPLACE FOR A
ROMANTIC EVENING DESTROYING
EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL FRAUD.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, OF COURSE, EVEN IF YOU MAKE
IT TO YOUR YACHT, WHERE WILL THE
1% GO TO REBUILD OUR SOCIETY?
LUCKILY SILICON VALLEY
BILLIONAIRE PETER SEAL HAS THE
ANSWER, IS FUNDING THE CREATION
OF A NETWORK OF ARTIFICIAL
LIBERTARIAN ISLAND.
FINALLY A HAVEN AS CONNECTED TO
LAND AS LIBERTARIANS ARE TO
REALITY.
(LAUGHTER)
THESE ANYTHING-GO ISLANDS WILL
HAVE IT ALL.
>> IT'S A PLANNED FLOATING
NATION OR CITY CONSTRUCTED ON
BARGES AND WATER PLATFORMS.
IT WILL HAVE EVERYTHING LIKE
SCHOOLS AND HOMES AND HOSPITALS
AND BIKES FOR TRANSPORTATION.
EVEN AQUA FARMS FOR FOOD.
>> Stephen: YES!
AQUA FARMS.
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
WHO'S GOING TO HARVEST ALL OF
THE AQUA FRUIT IF EVERYONE ON
THE ISLAND IS RICH?
SIMPLE, WE WILL BREED DOLPHINS
WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND MAKE
AQUA MEXICANS.
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
PORPY, SQUEAK IN ENGLISH!
(LAUGHTER)
AND, YES, THAT'S AN ARTIST'S
APPROXIMATION.
AND, YES, YOU WILL BE STARTING
OVER IN A BRAND NEW WORLD BUT
MAKE SURE TO BRING ALONG YOUR
ARMORED LIMO, YOUR YACHT, AND
YOUR R.V. JUST IN CASE THESE
REMOTE SOCIETIES OF NO LABORS,
NO BUILDING CODES OR FIREARM
RESTRICTIONS BREAKS DOWN FOR
SOME REASON.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL THAT'S IT FOR COLBERT
PLATINUM.
TUNE IN NEXT TIME FOR AN ANSWER
TO THE AGE-OLD QUESTION "COULD
GOD BUILD A YACHT SO BIG EVEN HE
COULD NOT FILL IT WITH BITCHES?"
