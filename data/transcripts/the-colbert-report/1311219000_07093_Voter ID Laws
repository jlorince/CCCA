STILL, FUNNY.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAS
BEEN AN AMERICA, THERE HAVE BEEN
IRREGULARITIES AT THE POLLS.
FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW THAT
MANY VOTING BOOTHS DO NOT HAVE
HOOKS TO HANG UP YOUR PANTS, AND
THESE IRREGULARITIES ARE VERY
SUSPICIOUS.
FOR INSTANCE, IN 2008, NONE OF
MY FRIENDS AT THE CLUB VOTED FOR
BARACK OBAMA, AND YET SUPPOSEDLY
HE WON.
AND MY CLUB'S NOT SOME
OUT-OF-TOUCH ENCLAVE.
WE'RE VERY MULTICULTURAL.
LAST WEEK THEY SERVED MOJITOS.
AND WHEN PEOPLE I DON'T LIKE GET
ELECTED, THERE'S ONLY ONE
EXPLANATION.
>> ALLEGATIONS OF VOTER FRAUD
CONTINUE TO POP UP ALL ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.
>> VOTER FRAUD.
>> VOTER FRAUD.
>> VOTER FRAUD.
>> VOTER FRAUD.
>> Stephen: YES, VOTER FRAUD.
TAKE OHIO, A CRUCIAL SWING STATE
IN THE LAST FEW ELECTIONS.
THERE A STATEWIDE SURVEY OF
VOTES CAST IN 2002 AND 2004
FOUND THAT OUT OF NINE MILLION
AND 78 THOUSAND VOTES, THERE
WERE FOUR INSTANCES OF FRAUD.
THAT IS A JAW-DROPPING 44/1
MILLIONTH OF 1%.
FOLKS, OUR DEMOCRACY IS UNDER
SIEGE FROM AN ENEMY SO SMALL IT
COULD BE HIDING ANYWHERE.
NOW, SOME SAY THESE NUMBERS
INDICATE THERE IS NO WIDESPREAD
FRAUD MEANS THERE IS NO
WIDESPREAD FRAUD.
WRONG!
JUST LISTEN TO OHIO STATE
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE BOB
MECKLENBORG, WHO SAID OF VOTER
FRAUD, "I BELIEVE IT HAPPENS,
BUT IT'S PROVING A NEGATIVE.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE A
NEGATIVE.
HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT FRAUD
DOESN'T EXIST THERE?"
YES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE A
NEGATIVE, THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE
IN VOTER FRAUD AND WHY NO ONE
WILL EVER CONVINCE ME THAT THIS
IS NOT BUTTER.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
BUT, FOLKS, IT CAME OUT OF A
COW.
IT CAME OUT OF A COW.
BUT THE MOST INSIDIOUS FORM OF
FRAUD IS PEOPLE VOTING WRONG.
ASK REPUBLICAN NEW HAMPSHIRE
HOUSE SPEAKER WILLIAM O'BRYANT,
WHO BACK IN JANUARY SAID THIS
ABOUT COLLEGE KIDS AT THE POLLS:
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
>> IT'S LIFE EXPERIENCE.
THEY JUST VOTE.
>> YES, COLLEGE KIDS LACK THE
LIFE EXPERIENCE TO VOTE.
IT TAKES YEARS OF SOUL-CRUSHING
DISAPPOINTMENT TO BE DEAD ENOUGH
INSIDE TO ELECT SOMEONE LIKE
WILLIAM O'BRIEN.
NOW, THANKFULLY REPUBLICAN
LAWMAKERS IN TEXAS, GEORGIA,
INDIANA, WISCONSIN, KANSAS,
TENNESSEE AND SOUTH CAROLINA
HAVE ALL PASSED LAWS THAT
REQUIRE VOTERS TO SHOW
GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO I.D.
IT MAKES SENSE, AFTER ALL, YOU
HAVE TO SHOW A GOVERNMENT-ISSUED
I.D. TO BUY LIQUOR, AND VOTING
CAN ALSO MAKE YOU WAKE UP IN THE
MORNING AND SAY, "WHAT DID I DO"
AND THEN THROW UP IN A TRASH
CAN.
>> IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO
REGISTER TO VOTE AND VOTE.
>> IT'S A POLL TAX.
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP POOR
PEOPLE FROM VOTINGS, THE
MINORITY FROM VOTING, THE
ELDERLY FROM VOTING.
WE ARE NOT STUPID.
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US, MADAM.
THESE LAWS AREN'T DESIGNED TO
KEEP THOSE DEMOCRATS FROM
VOTING.
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO KEEP THE
WRONG PEOPLE FROM VOTING.
>> WHY DO WE HAVE THESE
CAMPAIGNS SAYING, WE HAVE TO GET
ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE?
YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.
LET'S STOP SAYING EVERYONE
SHOULD VOTE.
VOTING IS IMPORTANT.
>> IF PEOPLE CANNOT EVEN FEED
AND CLOTHE THEMSELVES, SHOULD
THEY BE ALLOWED TO VOTE?
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> IF YOU'RE NOT A PROPERTY
OWNER, SORRY, BUT PROPERTY
OWNERS HAVE MORE OF A VESTING
STEAK IN THE COMMUNITY THAN
NON-PROPERTY OWNERS.
>> THAT'S TEA PARTY NATION
FOUNDER JUDSON PHILLIPS.
HE KNOWS THE FOUNDING FATHERS
WERE PROPERTY OWNERS, AND SOME
OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THAT
PROPERTY JUST SHOULDN'T VOTE.
NOW, THERE HAVE TO BE STANDARDS,
FOLKS.
LIKE THE NEW LAW IN TEXAS THAT
WON'T ALLOW A STUDENT I.D. TO BE
USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF VOTING
BUT WILL ALLOW CONCEALED HANDGUN
LICENSES.
IF ANYTHING, THIS WILL EXPAND
THE VOLTER ROLES.
IN TEXAS IT'S WAY EASIER TO GET
A GUN THAN A COLLEGE DEGREE.
BUT I AM MOST PROUD OF THE NEW
ANTI-FRAUD LEGISLATION IN MY
HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
JIM?
>> IT'S BEING CALLED ONE OF THE
NATION'S TOUGHEST VOTER I.D.
LAWS OUT THERE.
UNDER THE NEW LAW, VOTERS WILL
BE REQUIRED TO SHOW A DRIVER'S
LICENSE, MILITARY IMD. OR
PASSPORT.
>> Stephen: AND I HAPPEN TO
KNOW IT'S EASY TO GET A SOUTH
CAROLINA PHOTO I.D.
I MADE THEM ALL THE TIME IN HIGH
SCHOOL.
AND GASTON MOUNTABANK STILL
SHOWS UP EVERY YEAR AROUND TAX
TIME.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THE KNOT ON MY TIE IS BIGGER
THAN ON MY HEAD.
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
DOESN'T SEE A PROBLEM HERE,
FOLKS.
NEITHER DOES SOUTH CAROLINA
GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY.
JIM?
>> FIND ME THOSE PEOPLE THAT
THINK THIS IS INVADING THEIR
RIGHTS AND I WILL GO TAKE THEM
TO THE D.M.V. MYSELF AND HELP
THEM GET THAT PICTURE I.D.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
EVERYBODY JUST PILE INTO NIKKI
HALEY'S CAR, BUT YOU ARE GOING
TO WANT TO CALL SHOTGUN BECAUSE
ACCORDING TO THE STATE ELECTION
COMMISSION, SHE'LL HAVE TO PICK
UP 178,000 VOTERS IN SOUTH
CAROLINA WHO DON'T HAVE PHOTO
I.D.s.
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ABLE TO PICK
THEM ALL UP IN HER P.T. CRUISER,
THOUGH A LOT OF THOSE VOTERS ARE
BLACK, SO SHE MIGHT GET PULLED
OVER.
BUT EVEN THEN IT IS POSSIBLE THE
WRONG PEOPLE COULD GET ELECTED.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETHING A
LITTLE MORE SELECTIVE THAN A
PHOTO I.D.
I TELL YOU WHAT, THESE I.D. LAWS
PROVE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS ARE
GREAT JUDGES OF WHO SHOULD VOTE,
SO LET'S JUST CUT OUT THE MIDDLE
MAN AND LET ONLY REPUBLICAN
LEGISLATORS BE VOTERS.
THAT WAY WE WILL FINALLY BE
CERTAIN THAT ONLY THE RIGHT
PEOPLE GET ELECTED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
