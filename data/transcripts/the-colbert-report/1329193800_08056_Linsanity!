(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
WELL, FOLKS, THE SHOW WAS ON
HIATUS LAST WEEK IN OBSERVANCE
OF YOM KI-MARTIN LUTHER FOURTH
OF JUL-EASTER.
(LAUGHTER)
ONE OF THE MANY LONG RELIGIOUS
FESTIVALS I'VE HAD ENGINEERED
INTO MY SCHEDULE SINCE I
CONVERTED TO ORTHODOX OWNING A
SAILBOATISM.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, AS USUAL, THERE WAS LOTS OF
BIG NEWS OVER THE MY BREAK.
(LAUGHTER)
MOST OF IT WAS BAD FOR HANDSOME
MILLIONAIRES FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, MY VERY OWN NEW YORK GIANTS
WON A WHOLE MESS OF SUPER BOWL!
WHOO!
WHOO, BABY!
WHOO!
AND THE CITY HAS BEEN
CELEBRATING HARD.
LAST WEEK, NEW YORK THREW THE
CHAMPIONS A TICKER TAPE PARADE
DOWN THE CANYON OF HEROES!
IRAQ WAR VETS, WE WILL GET TO
YOU EVENTUALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE ME THE
FOOTBALL, I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF
PROFESSIONAL BALL IN HOOP.
(LAUGHTER)
THE N.B.A. LOGO DOWN THERE.
THE ACTUAL N.B.A. LOGO LICENSING
FEE IS VERY EXPENSIVE SO...
(LAUGHTER)
WE WENT WITH THE GENERIC DOWN
HERE.
I THINK IT GETS THE IDEA OF A
LOGO ACROSS EVEN BETTER THAN THE
ACTUAL LOGO.
THE POINT IS, I LOVE THE GAME.
THE SLAM DUNKING, THE LAYOUTS,
THE RIM JOBS, ALL OF IT.
(LAUGHTER)
AND LIKE ALL TRUE NEW YORKERS,
RIGHT NOW I AM CAUGHT UP IN THE
TIDAL WAVE THAT IS NEW YORK
NICKS POINT GUARD JEREMY LIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS KID... THIS KID... HIGH
FIVE!
(LAUGHTER)
THIS KID HAS SINGLE-HANDEDLY
DONE THE UNTHINKABLE: MADE
PEOPLE WANT TO WATCH THE NEW
YORK NICKS!
(APPLAUSE)
>> IN ONE WEEK HE'S GONE FROM
THE BENCH TO THE TOP OF THE
N.B.A., HE WASN'T DRAFTED OUT OF
COLLEGE.
TWO N.B.A. TEAMS-- ROCKETS AND
GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS CUT HIM--
THE INCOME NICKS SCOOPED HIM UP
BUT SENT HIM DOWN TO THE
D-LEAGUE AND BECAUSE OF INJURIES
HE WAS CALLED BACK TO THE TEAM
AND IN ONE WEEK THIS UNKNOWN
ASIAN AMERICAN WITH A DEGREE IN
ECONOMICS FROM HARVARD HAS PUT
UP LE BRON JAMES LIKE NUMBERS.
>> HE CAME OUT OF VIRTUALLY
NOWHERE.
>> Stephen: YES, HE CAME OUT OF
NOWHERE WHICH IS MY NICKNAME FOR
HARVARD.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, YOU KNOW THINGS ARE ROUGH
WHEN A HARVARD ECONOMICS GRAD
HAS AN EASIER TIME GETTING A JOB
AS AN N.B.A. POINT GUARD THAN A
WALL STREET BOND TRADER.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I'M NOT SOME FAIR-WEATHER
FAN.
I'VE BEEN BEHIND MY BOY LIN
SINCE DAY ONE OF SOME TIME LAST
WEEK.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THERE IS A NAME FOR WHAT
WE'RE FEELING.
>> LIN-SANITY CONTINUES.
>> IT'S BECOME LIN-SANITY NEW
YORK.
>> NEW YORK BASKETBALL FANS HAVE
A RANGING RAGING CASE OF
LIN-SANITY.
>> Stephen: YES, I'VE HAD A
RAGING CASE OF LIN-SANITY.
I HAVE BEEN DECLARED LEGALLY
LIN-SANE.
MY SYMPTOMS?
LIN SOMNIA.
REST LEST LIN SYNDROME AND
LIN-TESTINAL BLOCKAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, IT'S AN EXCITING TIME.
FANS HAVE NOT COME DOWN WITH A
BASKETBALL-BORN DISEASE THIS
INTENSE SINCE THE MID-'70s
OUTBREAK OF KAREEM ABDUL
JA-BOTULISM.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT LIN-SANITY, IT CAUGHT THE
N.B.A. OFF GUARD.
ALL THE JEREMY LIN JERSEYS THAT
WERE ON THE SHELVES SOLD OUT--
BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ANY.
(LAUGHTER)
BEST OF ALL, JEREMY LIN HERE IS
CURRENTLY WITHOUT A CORPORATE
SPONSOR WHICH MEANS HE'S IN THE
MARKET FOR ENDORSEMENT DEALS.
SO, MR. LIN, IN THE SPIRIT OF
LIN-SANITY, I HOPE YOU WILL
CONSIDER ENDORSING MY LINE OF
PREMIUM LIN-OLEUM TILES.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TOUGH STUFF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PEEL AND STICK.
IT GOES EVERYWHERE.
AND, OF COURSE, JEREMY LINT.
AS WE SPEAK, I AM DRYING SOCKS
AND TOWELS AS FAST AS I CAN TO
MEET WHAT I
