[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU.
PLEASE.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, RIGHT OFF THE BEAN I
HAVE TO ADDRESS THE BREAKING
NEWS OUT OF CHINA.
MING MING, THE WORLD'S OLDEST
PANDA, IS DEAD AT THE AGE OF 34.
THIS COMES AS A REAL SURPRISE.
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY, WELL
DONE, SEAL TEAM SIX, ANOTHER
RIGHTEOUS KILL.
FOR TOO LONG OUR MORTAL ENEMIES,
THE CHINESE, HAVE BEEN USING
PANDAS' CUTENESS TO INFILTRATE
OUR HEARTS.
NEVER FORGET THAT THEY ARE PANDA
BEARS, GODLESS, KILLING
MACHINES.
I MEAN WE'VE ALL SEEN THE
FOOTAGE OF THEIR COMPOUND WHERE
THEY ARE LITERALLY BREEDING MORE
OF THESE CUDDLY COMMIES.
I CAN HEAR IT NOW, STEPHEN, HOW
CAN YOU SAY THAT ABOUT PANDAS.
THEY WOULDN'T HURT A FLY?
OH, REALLY, THEN WHY ARE THEY
LEARNING KUNG FU?
