>> Stephen: TONIGHT, TROUBLE
IN WISCONSIN.
SOMEBODY SNUCK IN A VEGETABLE.
THEN SOME OF BASEBALL'S
CHERISHED RECORDS ARE
THREATENED.
DON'T WORRY, BARRY BONDS, YOUR
HEAD SIZE RECORD IS STILL SAFE.
AND MY GUEST ANTHONY BOURDAIN
TRAVELS THE COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF
THE BEST FOOD.
I'LL ASK HIM WHICH COUNTRY HAS
THE BEST OLIVE GARDEN.
CARGILL HAS RECALLED GROUND
TURKEY.
