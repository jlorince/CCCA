(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT OBAMA'S WAR ON
TERROR CALLED KILL OR CAPTURE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE CAPTURE WAS AN OPTION.
PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL KLAIDMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MR. KLAIDMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME!
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR,
YOU'RE A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT FOR "NEWSWEEK" AND THE DAILY
BEAST AND YOU GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "KILL OR CAPTURE: THE WAR ON TERROR AND THE SOUL OF THE
OBAMA PRESIDENCY." HOW COULD THIS BE THE SOUL?
HIM KILLING OR CAPTURING TERRORISTS?
HOW COULD THAT BE THE SOUL OF THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY BECAUSE YOU HAD THIS GUY WHEN HE WAS RUNNING
HE'S THIS LOOSEY GOOSY TOUCHY FEELY ARTSY FARTSY WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU LET'S CLOSE
GUANTANAMO AND SING COUPLE BUY YA CANDIDATE AND NOW HE'S A STONE COLD KILLER.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> THAT'S WHAT I FOUND IN REPORTING THIS BOOK.
YOU HAD THE LAW PROFESSOR, THE LIBERAL IDEALIST AND HE SORT OF MORPHED INTO THIS KIND OF CAPED
CRUSADER WHO WAS KIND OF THE COMMANDER OF THE AMERICAN KILLING MACHINE.
SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING THAT HE'SAL EL?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, NOT LITERALLY.
BUT HE'S A COMPLICATED GUY AND I THINK THAT OBAMA FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I THINK UNDERSTOOD
THAT IF HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT THIS WAR IN A WAY THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE OCCUPYING COUNTRIES AND
SENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO FOREIGN LANDS THAT MAYBE HAVING A MORE TARGETED AND
PRECISE CAPABILITY SUCH AS DRONES WOULD KIND OF FIT HIS BASIC APPROACH.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF THE DRONES, THAT IS ONE THING THAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK,
OKAY?
AND IT'S THAT I KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
THIS IS OUR NATIONAL SECURITY HERE.
YOU HAVE PRINTED WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IN GOING AFTER OUR ENEMIES.
NOW OUR ENEMIES KNOW HE'S TRYING TO KILL THEM!
>> I THINK THE TERRORISTS KNOW ABOUT THE DRONES.
>> Stephen: THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
ONCE YOU AVOID LENGTHY PROSECUTIONS, LOOK IN THAT CAMERA AND REVEAL YOUR SOURCE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, THANKS FOR THE OFFER.
YOU KNOW, I PROMISED MY SOURCES THAT I WOULD NOT REVEAL THEIR IDENTITIES.
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
CAN I GUESS?
CAN I STKPWHES ARE THEIR INITIALS B.O.?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M NOT GOING TO SAY.
IF JOURNALISTS STARTED TO DO THAT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION I WRITE ABOUT AND
OTHERS WRITE ABOUT WOULDN'T GET OUT THERE AND WHO KNOWS ONE DAY YOU MIGHT BE PRESIDENT.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRUST ME,
DON'T YOU?
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE DRONES.
>> Stephen: SOMEDAY I MIGHT BE THE TARGET OF A TKROEP.
(LAUGHTER) HOW DOES HE... HOW DOES OBAMA MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
THIS IMPERIAL PRESIDENT WHO KILLS WHO HE WANTS.
(LAUGHTER) HOW DOES HE MAKE THESE DECISIONS?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A PRETTY VIGOROUS PROCESS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE IT GETS TO HIM.
>> Stephen: MAGIC 8 BALL?
(LAUGHTER) AND.
>> AND THEN HE DOES MAKE THE FINAL DECISION.
>> Stephen: HE MAKES THE FINAL CALL?
>> HE MAKES THE FINAL CALL.
>> Stephen: TO FLY THE DRONE.
HE SITS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE BASEMENT ACTUALLY GETTING THE GUY WITH A CONTROLLER?
"BARACK, COME UP TO DINNER!" "I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE!
I CAN'T SAVE THE GAME!
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR!"
>> I WILL SAY HIS CHIEF COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISOR JOHN BRENNAN AND HIS OTHER CLOSE
ADVISOR ON THESE ISSUES THEY'LL COME TO HIM, TAKE HIM OUT OF A
STATE DINNER AND THEY'LL HAVE HIM MAKE THESE GRIM CALLS.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS IS IT'S NOT LIKE HE THINKS,
WELL, HEY, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH KILLING GOING ON.
A LOT OF THE TIME WHAT HE'S DOING IS SCALING BACK THE KILL LISTS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO
EXERCISE SOME RESTRAINT OVER THE MILITARY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK GUANTANAMO WILL EVER BE SHUT DOWN?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
BUT A VERY CLOSE ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT SAID TO ME THAT GUANTANAMO'S GOING TO BE LIKE
SPAN DOW PRISON, THE GERMAN PRISON WHERE THE NAZIS WERE.
THERE MAY JUST BE ONE TOOTHLESS MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN LEFT BUT IT WILL STILL BE OPEN YEARS AND
YEARS FROM NOW.
>> Stephen: AND THE REST OF IT?
>> THE REST OF...
>> Stephen: THE PRISON?
JUST ONE GUY WILL JUST SIT THERE?
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS BEING LITERAL ABOUT IT BUT THE
POINT WAS IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED.
IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME.
>> Stephen: SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A METAPHOR.
(LAUGHTER) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: DAN KLAIDMAN, THE BOOK IS
