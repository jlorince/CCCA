THAT CHITLINS ARE HOG
INTESTINES.
SO WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR ANY
OF THESE CANDIDATES TO WIN
THE SOUTH?
HERE TO TELL ME IS THE
OFFICIAL SOUTHERN STRATEGIST
OF THE 2 004 AND 2008 JOHN
EDWARDS CAMPAIGN, 100% PURE
BUBBA MEAT MY FRIEND DAVID
SAUDERS.
WHAT'S UP, MUD CAT?
>> HEY, MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT,
JIMMY, COULD WE GIVE A
LITTLE SOUTHERN LIGHT IN
HERE.
PUT A LITTLE LIGHT, MAYBE
THROUGH THE MAGAZINE KNOLLIA,
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> BEAUTIFUL.
>> YOU WANT SOME SWEET TEA.
>> SURE.
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO.
>> IN A MASON JAR.
>> BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.
>> NOW DAVE, NOW DAVE, MUD
CAT, YOU'RE FROM THE SOUTH,
I'M FROM THE SOUTH, ALL
RIGHT.
BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT KINDS OF
SOUTH.
I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM.
>> I'M FROM THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHAN MOUNTAINS.
HERE'S WHERE I AM FROM.
>> THERE SI DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THOSE TWO SOUTHERNS.
LIKE HOW DO Y'ALL SEE SOUTH
CAROLINA.
>> WELL, I ALWAYS HEARD THAT,
YOU KNOW, SOUTH CAROLINA WAS
TOO SMALL TO BE A COUNTRY
AND TOO BIG TO BE A MENTAL
INSTITUTION.
>> THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO
THAT.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH TO
IT.
>> WE HAVE THREE CANDIDATES
WHO ARE NOT TRUE
SOUTHERNERS.
WHAT DO SOUTHERNERS CARE B
HOW CAN THEY REACH THEM?
>> WELL, IN THE SOUTH, AND
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
SOUTHERN STRATEGY, AND OF
COURSE, IT WAS IMPLEMENTED
EVEN FURTHER WITH LEE
ATWATER, INTRODUCED WEDGE
POLITICS IN 1980.
BUT I THINK THE BEST WAY TO
CHARACTERIZE THE SOUTH,
WHERE YOU'RE FROM AND WHERE
I'M FROM IS GO TO JIM WEBB'S
WORDS, FIGHT, SING, DRINK,
PRAY.
I THINK THAT IS PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING ABOUT US
CULTURALLY.
>> FIGHT, SING, DRINK, PRAY.
>> ALL RIGHT THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD PARTY.
>> IT DOES.
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHERE IS MY MANNERS, WOULD
YOU LIKE A GUN,.
>> LOVE TO.
>> ALL RIGHT THERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT, THIS FEELS GOOD
TO HOLD.
NOW NOW OKAY, NOW CAN
SOUTHERNERS TELL WHEN PEOPLE
ARE PANDERING TO THEM IN
FAKE WAYS?
LIKE WHAT ABOUT MITT SAYING
Y'ALL AND TALKING ABOUT
CHEESE GRITS.
>> WE DON'T EAT CHEESY GRITS
IN APPALACHAN.
WE EAT GRITS, I THINK CHEESE
WAS BROUGHT THERE BY THE
YANKEES.
>> REALLY?
FROM WISCONSIN AND VERMONT.
>> RIGHT.
>> WELL, CAN THE REPUBLICANS
WIN WITHOUT THE SOUTH?
>> THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING
TO TAKE THIS TOWN.
>> HOW DID THAT HAPPEN, HOW
DID NIXON TURN THE SOUTH
FULLY REPUBLICAN.
>> I THINK STROM THURMAN, OF
COURSE, MOVE TOGETHER
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE
SOUTHERN STRATEGY, I THINK,
YOU KNOW, THE SOUTHERN
STRATEGY WAS SMART BUT WHAT
IT REALLY GOT DOWN TO IS
1980 LEE ATWATER.
GOD, GUNS AND GAYS IS WHERE
IT WENT.
BUT THIS TIME, YOU KNOW, I
SEE MITT ROMNEY, ESPECIALLY,
IF YOU GO UP INTO THE RUST
BELT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
BE ABLE TO USE THE SAME
WEDGES OF GODS, BEGINS AND
GAYS.
>> IN THE SOUTH WE STILL
LOVE GOD, WE STILL LOVE OUR
GUNS AND YOU KNOW, BEING GAY
ISN'T AT THE TOP OF OUR
LIST.
>> THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG,
PROMINENT GAY REPUBLICANS IN
THE SOUTH, RIGHT.
>> WELL, YEAH BUT --
>> UNLESS NEWT HAS AN
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE, WHICH
WOULD SHOCK ALL THREE OF HIS
WIVES.
NOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO PANDER TO SOUTHERNERS ARE
THERE THINGS THAT PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T DO, POLITICIANS,
EXCUSE ME, ARE THERE THINGS
THAT POLITICIANS SHOULDN'T
DO, ARE THERE THINGS
POLITICIANS SHOULDN'T DO?
I MEAN YOU CAN GO TOO FAR IN
PANDERING TO SOUTHERN
PEOPLE?
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.
>> REALLY?
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.
IT IS EASY TO SPOT.
>> REALLY?
>> I DID THE MARK WARNER
CAMPAIGN IN 2001 AND HE
WASN'T FROM THE-- AND SO WE
IMMEDIATELY DECIDE, MARK
DOES, THAT WE'RE NOT GOING
TO DO THAT.
WE'RE GOING TO SAY I'M NOT
FROM THE CULTURE.
BUT I LIKE IT.
AND --
>> SO SHOULD MITT ROMNEY
DROP THE Y'ALL?
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE
BETTER.
I REALLY DO.
>> HE ONLY HAS ABOUT 24
HOURS LEFT.
>> I KNOW.
BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE A
FIGHT IN VIRGINIA AND NORTH
CAROLINA, AND IF HE DOESN'T
WIN FLORIDA, IN MY OPINION,
HE CAN'T BEAT OBAMA.
AND HE'S GOT TO WIN IT.
IF YOU TAKE THE FOURTH BIG
STATES, NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA,
TEXAS AND FLORIDA, HE'S GOT
TO WIN TWO OF THEM.
AND IF HE DON'T TAKE FLORIDA
AND YOU AND I BOTH KNOW IF
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR REDNECKS,
BY GOD, THE RIVER ERA HILTON
IS FULL OF THEM.
>> YEAH.
>> FLORIDA IS THE MECCA OF
REDNECKS.
>> REALLY.
NO OFFENSE TO MECCA.
(LAUGHTER)
DAVE MUD CAT SAUDERS, WE'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU, DAVE.
>> THANK YOU, STEVE.
