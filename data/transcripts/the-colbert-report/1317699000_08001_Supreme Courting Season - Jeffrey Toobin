NAIL-BITER WHICH IS FINE
BECAUSE MY INSURANCE COVERS
CUTE CALTRANS PLANTS.
NOBODY BUT NOBODY CAN
PREDICT HOW THE SUPREME
COURT IS GOING TO RULE ON
THIS ONE.
HERE TO PREDICT HOW THE
SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO
RULE ON THIS ONE, PLEASE
WELCOME CNN ANALYST AND
AUTHOR OF THE NINE, JEFFERY
TOOBIN.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
BACK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
OKAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT,
JEFFERY, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE ISSUES HERE.
I'M SORRY, DID YOU WANT SOME
DIP?
>> THAT'S OKAY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
ISSUES AT PLAY HERE.
WHAT IS THE INTERSTATE
COMMERCE CLAUSE.
DOES THAT REGULATE THE GUYS
WHO SELL THE ORANGES ON THE
OFF-RAMP AT THE INTERSTATE.
>> NO, NO, IT'S THE PART OF
THE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN
REGULATE ANYTHING RELATED TO
INTERSTATE COMMERCE, WHICH
THE SUPREME COURT
HISTORICALLY HAS INTERPRETED
VERY BROADLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAS THAT
GOT TO DO WITH THIS.
>> WELL, THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THE
HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY IS 17%
OF THE ECONOMY AND ALL OF
THE TRANSACTIONS LUMPED
TOGETHER HAVE A BIG AFFECT
ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
SO IT'S APPROPRIATE TO
REGULATE ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: AND THIS IS
GOING TO SETTLE IT ONCE AND
FOR ALL, RIGHT.
>> THEY ARE FINAL.
>> Stephen: NOW WHY IS THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION NOT
FIGHTING GETTING THIS TO THE
COURT.
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO
HAVE THEIR ASS HANDED TO
THEM, RIGHT.
>> WELL, NO, WE DON'T KNOW
THAT.
>> Stephen: COME ON.
>> THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO WIN.
>> Stephen: CAN THE
GOVERNMENT FORCE YOU TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
THIS ISN'T SAYING YOU CANNOT
DO SOMETHING, THIS IS SAYING
YOU MUST DO SOMETHING.
WHEN HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED.
>> THE GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU
TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY DON'T
MAKE YOU BUY THINGS.
>> WELL, THEY, SOMETIMES
THEY DO.
>> Stephen: WHEN.
>> NOT OFTEN.
>> Stephen: BUT-- HOLD ON,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
LEGAL ANALYST.
>> WHAT.
>> Stephen: CHECKMATE, I'M
SORRY.
THIS SHOWS HOW HARD OF A
CASE THIS HAS BEEN BECAUSE
I'M PULLING MY ARGUMENTS
RIGHT OUT OF MY ASS.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I'M TALKING
ABOUT, YOU ARE A LEGAL
ANALYST AND I'VE GOT YOU ON
THE ROPES HERE.
>> YOU DO.
BUT THE TAX, THEY TELL TO
YOU PAY TAX, THAT'S ALSO
PART OF THE CASE, THE TAXING
POWER.
>> Stephen: IF THEY CALLED
THIS A TAX WOULDN'T THAT
HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT CASE?
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE SAID
THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT A
TAX BUT THEN POLITICALLY IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN HARDER TO
PASS BECAUSE TO BE WANTS TO
HAVE TAXES PASSED.
>> Stephen: SO HOW DO YOU
THINK THAT BOTH SIDES ARE
GOING TO CRAFT THEIR
ARGUMENT?
IT IS GOING TO BE 5-4, AT
SOME POINT, RIGHT.
>> IT OFTEN IS, IT PROBABLY
WILL BE.
>> Stephen: WHO DOES IT COME
DOWN TO.
>> ANTHONY KENNEDY.
>> Stephen: O SO AGAIN IT
COMES DOWN TO KENNEDY.
>> USUALLY.
>> Stephen: SO ARE THEY
GOING TO CRAFT THE ARGUMENT
ITS STRAIGHT AT KENNEDY OR
ARE THEY GOING TO TRY TO DIG
DOWN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT APPEAL TO HIM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S HOW THEY WRITE THESE.
THEY CITE CASES THAT HE'S
WRITTEN IN THE PAST.
THEY VERY MUCH FOCUS THEIR
ARGUMENTS ON HIM.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU LOOKING
PARTICULARLY HANDSOME TODAY,
JUSTICE KENNEDY.
>> THAT MAY HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY
CHANCE THAT THE JUSTICES
WILL HAVE TO ALL RECUSE
THEMSELVES SINCE THEY HAVE
GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE.
>> I DOUBT THAT.
I DOUBT THAT.
>> Stephen: WELL, IS ANYBODY
GOING TO HAVE TO RECUSE
THEMSELVES?
(APPLAUSE)
>> YOU KNOW, JUSTICE
THOMAS'S WIFE HAS BEEN VERY
OUTSPOKEN, AGAINST THE
HEALTHCARE LAW.
SHE'S A POLITICAL ACTIVIST
AND SOME PEOPLE SAY HE
SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF YOU.
>> Stephen: AND KAGAN WORKS
FOR THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
>> CORRECT.
SOME SAY SHE SHOULD RECUSE
HERSELF.
>> Stephen: SHE HAS O
BILLION-- OBAMA ON HER.
YOU CAN'T WASH THAT OFF AS
FAR AS CONSERVATIVES ARE
CONCERNED.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: YOU WROTE A
GREAT BOOK ON THE SUPREME
COURT CALLED THE NINE.
ARE YOU --
>> IT WAS FANTASTIC.
I ENJOYED IT I DIDN'T GET
AROUND TO READING 1 THROUGH
8 YET.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE
COMING.
>> I DO, NEXT FALL.
>> Stephen: SEQUEL.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
HAPPEN ON THE SUPREME COURT,
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE YOUR BOOK
EXCITING, TIGER ATTACK.
>> I WOULD LIKE A 5-4
DECISION THAT SETS THE
COUNTRY ON FIRE ONE WAY OR
THE OTHER.
>> WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE
THE COUNTRY BURNS TO THE
GROUND SO YOU CAN SELL SOME
BOOKS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: JEFF ERIE TOOBIN,
THANK YOU SOP MUCH.
CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST
JEFFERY TOOBIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
