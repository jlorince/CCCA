ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN, FOLKS,
IT'S SAD, BUT THE NATIONAL MEDIA
IS ATTACKING DELAWARE SENATE
CANDIDATE CHRISTINE O'DONNELL BY
DIGGING UP EMBARRASSING VIDEO
CLIPS FROM HER PAST.
TODAY THEY DUG ONE UP FROM ALL
THE WAY BACK ON LAST NIGHT AT
8:00.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY.
IN HERE DEBATE AGAINST
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT CHRIS COONS.
JIM.
>> WHAT OPINIONS OF LATE THAT
HAVE COME FROM OUR HIGH COURT DO
YOU MOST OBJECT TO?
>> OH, GOSH, GIVE ME A SPECIFIC
ONE.
I'M SORRY.
>> ACTUALLY, I CAN'T, BECAUSE I
NEED DO YOU TELL ME WHICH ONES
YOU OBJECT TO.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I'M VERY SORRY.
RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I
KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT.
>> Stephen: NAILED IT!
AFTER ALL, AFTER ALL, THAT IS
THE OFFICIAL TEA PARTY ANSWER TO
THAT QUESTION.
>> WHAT OTHER SUPREME COURT
DECISIONS DO YOU DISAGREE WITH?
>> WELL, LET'S SEE.
THERE'S... OF COURSE, IN THE
GREAT HISTORY OF AMERICA, THERE
HAVE BEEN RULINGS THAT...
THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE
ABSOLUTE CONSENSUS BY EVERY
AMERICAN.
>> CAN YOU THINK OF ANY?
>> WELL, I WOULD THINK OF ANY
AGAIN THAT COULD BEST BE DEALT
WITH ON A MORE LOCAL LEVEL.
>> Stephen: BOOM SHAKA LAKA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN FACT, FOLKS, O'DONNELL
COULDN'T HAVE ANSWERED THAT
QUESTION BETTER IF SARAH PALIN'S
OWN ADVISERS HAD PREPPED HER FOR
THE DEBATE.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, I'M BEING TOLD THAT SARAH
PALIN'S ADVISERS PREPPED HER FOR
THE DEBATE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY.
SO IF ANY OTHER CANDIDATES OUT
THERE WANT THAT KIND OF ROCK
SOLID PREP, I'M PRETTY SURE
THOSE ADVISERS WILL BE AVAILABLE
SOON.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT O'DONNELL, O'DONNELL DID
HAVE A STRONG OPINION ABOUT ONE
COURT RULING.
JIM.
>> A FEDERAL JUDGE RECENTLY
RULED THAT WE HAD TO OVERTURN
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL."
THE MILITARY ALREADY REGULATES
PERSONAL BEHAVIOR.
IT DOESN'T ALLOW IF YOU'RE
MARRIED TO HAVE AN ADULTEROUS
AFFAIR WITHIN THE MILITARY.
>> Stephen: SO BEING GAY IN
THE MILITARY IS THE SAME AS
HAVING AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR IN
THE MILITARY.
THIS IS SHOCKING IN LIGHT OF
ANOTHER COMMENT CHRISTINE
O'DONNELL MADE IN THE '90s.
>> THE BIBLE SAYS THAT LUST IN
YOUR HEART IS COMMITTING
ADULTERY, SO YOU CAN'T
MASTURBATE WITHOUT LUST.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: SO LET'S FOLLOW
O'DONNELL'S IRONCLAD LOGIC.
BEING GAY IN THE MILITARY EQUALS
COMMITTING ADULTERY IN THE
MILITARY.
THE MILITARY IS ON BOTH SIDES,
SO REDUCE THAT EQUATION.
SO BEING GAY EQUALS COMMITTING
ADULTERY, AND MASTURBATING
EQUALS COMMITTING ADULTERY.
SO BY THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY OF
O'DONNELL, MASTURBATING EQUALS
BEING GAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
HOW COULD I NOT SEE THIS?
ALL THIS TIME I'VE BEEN DOING IT
WITH A DUDE.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, NATION, THE SHOCK DOES NOT
END THERE BECAUSE BACK WHEN I
HEARD CHRISTINE O'DONNELL REVEAL
THAT MASTURBATION IS ADULTERY, I
TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION AND
MARRIED MY HAND.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT MEANS I'M GAY MARRIED.
HOW COULD YOU LIE TO ME ALL
THESE YEARS?
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE HIGH
SCHOOL.
( LAUGHTER )
WORST OF ALL, WORST OF ALL, WHO
DO YOU THINK YOU WERE FOOLING
WEARING
