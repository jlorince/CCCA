AND STARS AND THINGSWITH DANCING FEET AND WATERMELON
RINGS I BRING THE SUNSHINE ANDTHE MOON AND THE WIND BLOWS MY
TUNE. MEANWHILE I SPOON POWDEREDDRUMBEATS INTO PLASTIC BAGS
SELLING KILOS OF KINTAE STAG,TAKING DRAGS OFF OF COLLARDS
AND CORNBREAD FREEBASING THROUGHSAXOPHONES AND FRUITS LIKE MAD,
THE HIGH NOTES MAKE MESPACE-FLOAT, I BE EXHALING RINGS
THAT CIRCLE SATURN, LEAVING INMY VEINS IN ASTROLOGICAL
PATTERNS. YEAH I'M SERIOUS B,DOGGONE [BLEEP] PLOTTED [SHIT]
LOVELY, BUT THE FEDS IS ALSOPLOTTING ME, THEY'RE TRYING TO
IMPRISON MY ASTROLOGY, PUT MYSTARS BEHIND BARS
MY STARS AND STRIPES, USINGBLOOD-SPATTERED BANNERS AS
NATIONALIST KITES, BUT I CONTROLTHE WIND, THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL IT THE HAWK. I AM HORUS,SON OF ISIS, SON OF OSIRUS,
WORSHIPPED AS JESUS, RESURRECTEDLIKE LAZARUS, BUT YOU CAN CALL
