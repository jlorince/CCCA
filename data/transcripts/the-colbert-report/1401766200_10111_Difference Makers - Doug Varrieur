NATION, I LOVE EVERY STATEIN AMERICA EQUALLY.
I COULD NEVER PICK A FAVORITEBUT GUN TO MY HEAD, I'D CHOOSE
FLORIDA.
THE STATE WHERE I WOULD MOSTLIKELY HAVE A GUN TO MY
HEAD.
THE SUNSHINE STATE PRODUCES-- SUNSHINE STATE
PRODUCES SOME OF AMERICA'SMOST POPULAR LAWS LIKE STAND
YOUR GROUND.
A LAW THAT WILL LEAVE FUTUREFLORIDIANS WONDERING WHAT
WAS GROUND?
AND TONIGHT, I PROFILE ONEFLORIDIAN WHO DOESN'T JUST
STAND HIS GROUND, HE STANDSYOUR GROUND.
JIM?
>> THIS IS BIG PINE KEYFLORIDA.
NEIGHBORLY, TRANQUIL-- WHATTHE [BLEEP]
THIS IS DOUG VARRIEUR.
HE SHOOTS GUNS IN HIS YARDAND HE IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER
LIKE SO MANY PATRIOTS BEFOREHIM DOUG VARRIEUR'S LOVE OF
FREEDOM HAS RUFFLED A FEWFEATHERS.
NO ONE LIKES HIM AT ALL.
HE'S OBNOXIOUS,INCONSIDERATE, CRAZY.
>> OVERBEARING, EGO-CENTRIC
>> IGNORANT.
>> ANNOYING.
>> CRYSTAL CLEAR.
>> A REAL KOOK.
>> VERY PUSHY.
>> ASININE.
>> VERY CONFRONTATIONAL.
>> SELF-CENTERED.
>> HE HAS A TENDENCY TOANNOY PEOPLE.
>> HE'S WACKO.
>> BUT WHAT SOME CALL WACKO,OTHERS CALL HEROIC-O BECAUSE
DOUG IS JUST EXERCISING HISSECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS
CLOSE TO HOME.
COUNT US IN, DOUG.
>> 3, 2, 1.
I BUILT A TPA: A TARGETPRACTICE AREA.
THE TARGET IS FOUR FOOT TALL3 FOOT WIDE, 8 INCHES THICK.
>> THIS IS DOUG'S HOUSE.
THIS IS DOUG'S YARD.
THESE ARE DOUG'S NEIGHBORS.
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOSTHEAVILY TRAFFICKED CANALS ON
BIG PINE KEYS.
AND THIS IS MONROE COUNTYCOMMISSIONER GEORGE NEUGENT.
>> THERE ARE VERY SAFE GUNRANGES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO
DOUG'S HOME WHICH COULD DRIVE TOAND SHOOT HIS GUN THERE.
>> FROM WHERE I LIVE, ANINDOOR GUN RANGE IS JUST
SIMPLY TOO FAR TO GO WHEN ICAN STAND IN MY SIDE YARD
AND SHOOT ON MY OWN RANGE.
>> WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO GETSHOT BECAUSE HE WON'T DRIVE
20 MINUTES TO A GUN RANGE.
>> WHY?
FOR THE SAME REASON HE CANFIRE TOWARDS KAYAKERS IN THE
CANAL.
>> HE EXPLAINED TO ME THATIT WAS HIS SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHT AND HE WAS GOINGCONTINUE TO DO IT.
>> THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGALABOUT ME SHOOTING IN MY
BACKYARD.
EVEN IF THERE IS A BOAT ANDA KID.
>> HE'S 20 FEET FROM ONE OFTHE BUSIEST CANALS ON BIG
PINE KEY AND HE REALLYDIDN'T CARE.
HE JUST TURNED AROUND ANDWALKED AWAY.
>> I DON'T CARE.
>> YOU RARELY FIND THAT KINDOF CIVIL DISCOURSE ANYWHERE
IN AMERICA.
BUT THIS ISN'T ANYWHERE,THIS IS FLORIDA.
>> OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TOLDUS THAT WE COULD NOT PREEMPT
IN ANY WAY DOUG FROM FIRINGTHE WEAPON IN HIS BACKYARD.
>> IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FORYOU TO STOP ME.
THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU DO STOPME, THEN YOU'LL BE IN
VIOLATION OF STATE LAW, CANBE REMOVED FROM YOUR JOB,
FINED $5,000 AND HAVE NOACCESS TO ANY PUBLIC FUNDS
FOR DEFENSE.
THAT'S THE LAW.
JUST BECAUSE IT'S LEGALDOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
>> NO.
WHAT MAKES IT RIGHT AREDOUG'S STATE OF THE ART
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS.
>> COUNT AGAIN 3, 2, 1.
>> MY TARGET PRACTICE AREAIS VERY, VERY SAFE.
>> CASE CLOSED.
>> IT IS NOT SAFE WHATSOEVER.
>> OH REALLY?
>> WELL, LISTEN  TO DOUG'SFOOLPROOF SECURITY SYSTEM.
>> BEFORE ANYBODY FIRES ASHOT, WE ASK FOR AN
ALL-CLEAR FROM OUR LOOKOUTS.
>> THESE ARE DOUG'SLOOKOUTS.
(LAUGHTER)>> MOM AND DAD THEY'RE
LOOKOUTS.
SHE MAY SAY CLEAR OR MAY SAYGO, AND SHE MAY SAY NO.
BEING 85 YEARS OLD, SHEBOUNCES AROUND.
>> YOU GOT THAT NERVOUSNELLIES.
HOW MUCH SAFER DOES HE NEEDTO GET.
>> NICE AND LOUD, ARE WECLEAR.
>> YOU'RE CLEAR SON.
>> CLEAR.
>> RANGE IS HOT
>> RANGE IS HOT
IT'S DOUG'S ANTI-GUN NUTNEIGHBORS WHO
ARE REALLY DISTURBING THEPEACE.
>> HIS NEIGHBORS ARE JUSTGOING BAT [BLEEP] CRAZY,
THERE'S A LOT OF SCREAMINGGOING ON.
>> I THINK THE ONES THAT AREAGAINST IT JUST DON'T LIKE
GUNS.
>> I'M ALL FOR GUNS, IREALLY AM.
I DO NOT HATE GUNS.
>> THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKEHIS GUNS AWAY.
>> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE HISGUNS AWAY.
I JUST DON'T WANT A BULLETIN MY HEAD WHILE I'M SITTING ON
THE PORCH DRINKING A BEER AFTERA HARD DAY KILLING BUGS.
>> IF HE MISSES THE TARGETI'M ONLY AND IT COMES MY WAY,
I'M ONLY 120 FEET AWAY FROMBEING SHOT.
>> SHE JUST GOES ON AND ON,DOESN'T SHE.
>> SO IS THERE ANY DOWNSIDETO DOUG SHOOTING GUNS IN HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> IF YOU WERE TO MISS THETARGET, IT'S POSSIBLE
HE COULD SHOOT ONE OF HISPARENTS.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF ARICOCHET BULLET WILL KILL
ME.
IF SO, I GUESS I'LL DIE.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.
>> IF ONLY WE ALL COULD BESO SENSIBLY RESIGNED TO THE
ICY GRIP OF DEATH.
FOR THE RECORD, DOUG, DO YOUEVER MISS.
>> DO I EVER MISS MYINTENDED TARGET? (LAUGHS)
>> GOOD ENOUGH.
BUT SOME NAYSAYERS LIKE BIGGUN CLUB SAFETY OFFICER
JORDAN WELLSHELL SAYSMISSING IS POSSIBLE.
>> EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINTEVERYBODY MISSES THE TARGET.
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THATHAVE COMPLETELY MISSED THE
TARGET.
>> BUT EVEN IF HE DOES MISS,DOUG HAS A BACKUP SAFETY
PLAN.
>> TO GIVE THE NEIGHBORS ASENSE OF SAFETY, I PUT THESE
VEHICLES ON BOTH SIDES OF MYTARGET PRACTICE AREA.
>> THAT COMPLETELY BLOCKS --
>> I GOT A WALL BETWEEN MEAND THEN.
>> SATISFIED, NEIGHBORS?
NOW THERE'S A WALL OF TRUCK.
>> AS FAR AS DOUG PARKING HISTRUCK TO BLOCK ANY CHANCES OF A
RICOCHET, PROBABLY NOT AGOOD IDEA SEEING THE FACT
THAT IT IS FULL OF FUEL.
>> YEAH THERE IS THAT.
>>  ♪HE FIRED HIS GUNS AND THENEIGHBORS STARTED RUNNING ♪
