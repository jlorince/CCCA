JIM.
THANK YOU, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: NOW THE AMERICA'SCUP, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY
NOT BE INTO BIG BOAT SAIL RACINGIT'S THE OLDEST TOURNAMENT IN
THE WORLD, RIGHT?
>> OLDEST TROWNY INTERNATIONALSPORT, PREDATES THE MODERN
OLYMPICS, OVER 160 YEARS OLD.
SO, YEAH, THE OLDEST TROPHY OUTTHERE.
>> Stephen: AND YOU WON THIS FORAMERICA.
>> WE KEPT IT HERE FOR AMERICA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: NOW I KNOW AMERICA
PRETTY WELL.
I'M HAVING TROUBLE PLACING YOURACCENT, THOUGH.
(LAUGHTER)>> IT'S FROM THE SOUTH.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
PRETTY DEEP SOUTH.
YOU ARE FROM WHERE, SIR?
>> I'M FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER,FROM AUSTRALIA.
SYDNEY ORIGINALLY.
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: LET'S EXPLAIN TO THE
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHAT IT WASYOUR DOING IN SAN FRANCISCO
HARBOR FOR THE AMERICA'S CUP.
I'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF OCEANSAILING BUT THIS IS ALMOST
ENTIRELY BUT NOT COMPLETELYUNLIKE SAILING.
LET'S SHOW PEOPLE WHAT WE'RELOOKING AT.
EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING INTHESE BOATS.
>> WELL, THE LIGHTEST THING ONTHESE BOATS IS THE FOILING.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THERE, YOUMIGHT HAVE SEEN LAIRD HAMILTON
ON A SURF BOARD DOING THIS.
NOW WE'RE DOING IT ON A 72 FOOTCARBON FIRE MULTIHULLS AND WE
HAVE A CARBON FIBER WING, JUSTLIKE THE WING OFF THE SIDE OF AN
AIRCRAFT AND IT IS INSANE.
RACING ON THAT BAY IT'S LIKENASCAR ON WATER.
>> Stephen: I'M USED TO BEING ONA SAILBOAT ON THE WATER BUT THIS
LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A SPACESHIPWITH 130-FOOT SAIL AND JUST TWO
CRUISE MISSILE STRAPPED TO IT.
(LAUGHTER)HOW DO YOU CONTROL SOMETHING
THAT IS BARELY IN THE WATER LIKETHAT?
HOW FAR DO YOU GET OFF THE WATERWHEN YOU'RE COOKING?
>> YOU GO PROBABLY ABOUT A METERAND A HALF TWO METERS.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SPEAKWHATEVER THAT IS.
(LAUGHTER)A METER, IS THAT 50 FEET?
TWO METERS?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
10 FOOT OR SOMETHING.
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVERREALLY IN CONTROL.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE RIDING AMOTORBIKE.
YOU'RE IN CONTROL UNTIL YOU FALLOFF AND IT'S ONE HELL OF A RIDE.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE FESTESTYOU GO NOT ON THE FOILS?
>> NOT ON THE FOILS PROBABLY 30KNOTS.
>> Stephen: AND WHEN THE FOILSKICK UP HOW FAST DO YOU GO?
>> THEN IT'S LIKE A TURBO BOOST.
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS YOU ISWHERE THE FOILS JUST START TO --
THE WATER BOILS AROUND THEFOILS.
IT'S THAT HIGH A PRESSURE ANDIT'S ALMOST LIKE A SPEED
LIMITER.
BUT AS WE GET BETTER AND LEARNMORE IT'S LIKE A QUANTUM LEAP
FOR US IN THIS SPORT, WE'LLFIGURE OUT HOW TO GO FASTER AND
FASTER AND TOP SPEEDS WILL KEEPRISING.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE TOPSPEED RIGHT NOW
>> ON OUR BOAT ABOUT 48 KNOTS.
>> Stephen: AGAIN -->>
(LAUGHTER)>> YEAH, CLOSE TO 60 MILES AN
HOUR.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Stephen: 60 MILES AN HOUR?
SO YOU COULD GET PULLED OVER ONSOME HIGHWAY.
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THE FOUNDER OFORACLE LARRY ELLISON ACTUALLY
PAID FOR THIS.
$100 MILLION COMING OUT OF HISPOCKET.
>> LARRY'S BEEN GREAT AND A LOTOF OTHER GREAT SPONSORS BUT
LARRY'S A REAL COMPETITOR, LOVESRACING AND WHAT YOU SAW ON THE
BAY WAS HIS VISION.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE'S PEOPLEDOUT THERE AND IT'S SUCH A BIG
STEP FOR THE SPORT NOW.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKEWORKING FOR ONE OF THE RICHEST
MEMBER IN THE WORLD?
DO, LIKE, 20 BILLS FALL OFF HIM?
(LAUGHTER)>> HE'S GREAT.
THE COOLEST THING ABOUT LARRY ISHE'S SELF-MADE.
HE CAME FROM NOTHING AND, YOUKNOW, THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT
HIM.
WHEN HE COMES DOWN TO THE BASEAND HANGS OUT WITH THE GUYS HE'S
JUST LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER GUYSAND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE
LOVES.
WHEN HE COMES ON THE BOAT WETREAT HIM LIKE ANYONE ELSE.
HE GETS YELLED AT AND THAT'SSOMETHING HE'S NOT USED TO.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: ONE OF THE GOOD
THING ABOUT THE AMERICA'S CUP ISNOW THAT AMERICA'S GOT IT, WE
GET TO SET THE RULES FOR WHATTHE RACE HAS TO BE NEXT TIME,
RIGHT?
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: WHO DID YOU SFWHAET>> THE KIWIS, THE NEW ZEALAND
TEAM.
>> Stephen: AS AN AUSTRALIAN,DID THAT FEEL GOOD?
>> OH, MATE.
(LAUGHTER)YOU BEAT THOSE HOBBIT HUMPERS.
(LAUGHTER)>> I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU,
MATE, IT FEELS FANTASTIC.
>> Stephen: ARE THEY THE ONESTHAT SET THE RULES THAT IT WOULD
BE ON THE HYDRO FOIL BOATS IS?
>> WE WERE THE LAST ONE, BROUGHTIT TO SAN FRANCISCO BAY, PULLED
OUT THE NEW BOAT, NEW FORMAT.
NOW WE DO IT AGAIN SO WE COME UPWITH THE RULES.
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A HUGE SUCCESSAND FOR THE FIRST TIME
NON-SAILORS ARE WATCHING SAILINGON T.V..
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.
>> Stephen: LIKE RIGHT NOW.
>> LIKE, EXACTLY.
SO THAT'S WHAT'S SO COOL ANDEXCITING.
>> Stephen: CAN I SUGGESTSOMETHINGING?
SAY TO THIS LARRY: HOW ABOUTNEXT TIME SAME BOAT BUT YOU SAIL
JUST ON AN OCEAN OF HIS CASH.
(LAUGHTER)>> I'LL GIVE IT A GO.
I WON'T PROMISE ANYTHING.
NEXT TIME I SPEAK TO HIM I MAYBRING THAT UP.
WE'LL SEE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ME?
I SAIL.
IF YOU NEED A CREW MEMBER, IMAKE EXCELLENT BALLAST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)6-
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, I BROUGHTTHIS HAT ALONG BECAUSE THESE
HATS ONLY THE ATHLETES WEAR,ONLY THE SAILORS SO I'M IN THE
RECRUITMENT PROCESS SO I'MINVITING YOU.
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, MATE,JUMP ON BOARD.
