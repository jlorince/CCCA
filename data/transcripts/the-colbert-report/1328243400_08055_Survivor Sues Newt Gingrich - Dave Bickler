>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, AFTER HIS PRIMARY
LOSS TO MITT ROMNEY IN
FLORIDA, NEWT GINGRICH IS
CLEARLY THE UNDERDOG.
WHICH MEANS HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HITCH A RIDE TO NEVADA
STRAPPED TO THE ROOF OF
MITT'S CAR.
BUT NOW NEWT IS FACING A
SURPRISING ATACK FROM THE
PAST.
>> NEWT GINGRICH IS BEING
SUED FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF
THE SONG EYE OF THE TIGER.
>> GINGRICH'S CAMPAIGN PLAYS
THE SONG AT HIS RALLIES.
EYE OF THE TIGER WAS A BIG
HIT FOR THE GROUP SURVIVOR
THERE 1928.
>> Stephen: YES, EYE OF THE
TIGER, THE POWER ANTHEM FROM
ROCKY 3.
AND ROCKY IS AN OBVIOUS FAR
LEGAL FOR NEWT.
HE'S AN UNDERDOG, A BORN
SCRAPPER, AND HE'S FIGHTING
FOR THE CHANCE TO BE SMACKED
AROUND BY A BLACK GUY.
BUT FOLKS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE NEWT,
HE VIOLATED SOMETHING I LOVE
EVEN MORE.
COPYRIGHT LAW.
AND NEWT SHOULD BE MORE
SENSITIVE TO COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT.
BECAUSE AS SURVIVOR
GUITARIST AND CO-AUTHOR OF
THE SONG FRANK SULLIVAN
POINTS OUT HIS COMPLAINT,
NEWT HIMSELF IS THE AUTHOR
OR CO-AUTHOR OF OVER 40
COPYRIGHTED WORKS.
AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT
HIS ALBUM OF HOEDOWN SONG
PARODIES NEWTENANNY.
WELL THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
TO EVEN THE SCORE.
I SAY AN EYE FOR AN EYE OF
THE TIGER.
I BELIEVE SOMEONE SHOULD
SING NEWT'S LATEST BOOK, A
NATION LIKE NO OTHER WITHOUT
PERMISSION.
TO DO SO, PLEASE WELCOME THE
ORIGINAL SINGER OF SURVIVOR'S
EYE OF THE TIGER, MR. DAVE
BICKLER.
HIT IT, DAVE.

WHAT, WE'RE GOING GO TO
