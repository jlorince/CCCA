THE 9/11 CROSS IS JUST THELATEST SIGN THAT AMERICA IS
GOING TO THE BOW WOWS.
GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL IN 17STATES.
MEDICAL OR RECREATIONALMARIJUANA IS LEGAL IN 20
STATES.
AND-- IN COLORADO YOU CANNOW LEGALLY MARRY YOUR BONG.
YOU MAY NOW TOKE THE BRIDE.
AND FOLKS, I THINK I KNOWWHY.
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO ARECENT STUDY OF AMERICAN
CHURCHES A QUARTER OF ALLCONGREGATIONS HAD FEWER THAN
50 PEOPLE IN THE PEWS,LEADING TO THE NEW CHILDHOOD
GAME, HERE'S THE CHURCH,HERE'S THE STEEPLE, OPEN THE
DOORS, THERE'S LIKE SIXPEOPLE IN THERE AT MOST.
THAT'S NOT A LOT.
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BADAMONG MEN.
ACCORDING TO A RECENT ABC, POLL WHILE 45% OF
AMERICAN WOMEN GO TO CHURCHEACH WEEK, ONLY 34% OF MEN
DO.
LUCKILY, THERE'S A WAY TOBRING MEN BACK INTO THE FOLD
AND IT BRINGS US TOTONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PEW, PEW, PEW.
FOLKS, AMERICA IS NO LESS OFA CHRISTIAN NATION THAN IT'S
EVER BEEN, BUT UNFORTUNATELYTHE OLD METHODS OF PUTTING
BUTTS IN THE WOOD SEATSDOESN'T WORK.
JUST ASK KENTUCKY BAPTISTCHUCK McALISTER
WHO SAID THE DAY OF HANGINGA BANNER IN FRONT OF YOUR
CHURCH AND SAYING YOU AREHAVING A REVIVAL AND
EXPECTING THE COMMUNITY TOSHOW UP IS OVER.
EXACTLY.
A BANNER DOESN'T CUT IT ANYMORE.
YOU'VE GOT TO AT LEAST TRY AJESUS BLOWY MAN.
(APPLAUSE)McALISTER HAS A MUCH BETTER
WAY TO GET MEN INTO CHURCH.
>> HOST OF TELEVISION SHOWVENTURE BOUND OUTDOORS.
WE'RE EXCITED THAT WE'REGOING TO BE IN THE AREA AT
BAPTIST CHURCH ON THURSDAYMARCH 6th.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS IT.
FREE ADMISSION, FREE STEAKDINNER AND GET THIS, 25 GUNS.
>> Stephen: 25 GUNS.
(APPLAUSE)COME ON!
NO OTHER RELIGION OUT THEREIS GOING TO BE ABLE TO
COMPETE WITH FREE STEAKS ANDGUNS.
WHAT ARE THE HINDUS GOINGTO OFFER, A BOWL OF
CHICKPEAS AND THE KNOWLEDGETHAT IN A PREVIOUS LIFE YOU
WERE A BOWL OF CHICKPEAS?
(LAUGHTER)YOU SEE, FOLKS, PEOPLE USED
TO GO TO CHURCH FOR A LOT OFREASONS.
THEY WOULD GO FOR A SENSE OFCOMMUNITY, UPHOLDING
TRADITION, FINDING ANSWERSTO LIFE'S BIGGEST QUESTIONS.
BUT THESE DAYS ALL OF THAT,ALL OF THAT IS JUST
INTANGIBLE.
AND THESE DAYS PEOPLE WANTSOMETHING MORE.
PLUS-- (LAUGHTER)
GIVING OUT FREE GUNS ISCONSISTENT WITH CHRIST'S
MESSAGE.
AS McALISTER REMINDED US,QUOTE, JESUS WAS PRETTY
HANDY WITH THE WHIP WHEN HERAN THE MONEY CHANGERS OUT
OF THE TEMPLE.
YES, YES, REMEMBER, JESUSUSES A WHIP IN THAT GOSPEL
STORY.
BUT FOLKS-- PEOPLE, PEOPLEIN KENTUCKY DON'T USE WHIPS.
NO, PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY, THEYUSE GUNS.
THEY LOVE GUNS.
AS McALISTER KNOWS THAT IFYOU WANT TO REACH THEM, YOU
NEED TO SPEAK GUN.
OR AS McALISTER PUTS IT,HUNTING IS HUGE IN KENTUCKY
SO WE GET IN THERE AND BURPAND SCRATCH AND TALK ABOUT
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
AND THAT STUFF.
YES.
YOU GOT THE BURP AND SCRATCHABOUT GOD LIKE THE
WELL-KNOWN EVANGELIST LARRYTHE CABLE SAINT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
FOLKS, DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSEGUYS JUST LOVE?
YOU KNOW WHAT GUYS LOVEOTHER THAN STEAKS AND GUNS?
GUYS LOVE STRIPPERS ANDUNLIMITED SHRIMP.
I SAY FILL IN THE BAPTISMALFONT WITH COCKTAIL SAUCE,
SWAP OUT THAT GIANT CROSSFOR A BRASS POLE AND SWITCH
OUT THAT COLLECTION BASKETFOR A COLLECTION G STRING.
NOW THIS-- THIS MIGHT NOT-- (APPLAUSE)
THE TRUTH IS THIS MIGHT NOTBE ALL KOSHER WITH THE BIBLE
TEACHINGS.
BY THE WAY, JEWS, YOU KNOWWHAT WOULD REALLY GET GUYS
INTO THE SYNAGOGUE, GRILLEDPORK CHOPS.
THE BOTTOM LINE, YOU GOT TOBRING MEN HOME TO JESUS BY
ANY MEANS NECESSARY.
EVEN IF THAT MEANS WEAPONS.
REMEMBER, JESUS SAID ALLTHOSE WHO TAKE UP THE SWORD
SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD.
AND IF CHURCHES GIVE OUTENOUGH WEAPONS, WE CAN BRING
A LOT OF PEOPLE HOME TOJESUS FOR GOOD.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WAIT THREE DAYS AND IT WILLRISE AGAIN, AND MY GUEST
