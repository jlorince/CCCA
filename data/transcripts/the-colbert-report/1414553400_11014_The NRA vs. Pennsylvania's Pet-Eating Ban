GIVE ME A BREAK.
OF COURSE, THE KITTEN CODDLERSOUT THERE DON'T WANT YOU TO EAT
YOUR PETS.
THAT'S ILLEGAL, THEY SAY.
WELL, NOT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE YOUCAN HAVE A DOG FOR DINNER IN
PENNSYLVANIA, THANKS TO THEN.R.A.
(BOOING)  NO, IT'S TRUE.
THAT WAS SPOOKY, THOUGH.
TO FIND OUT HOW THIS WHOLE THINGSTARTED, LET'S GO TO WPVI,
PENNSYLVANIA'S NEWS LEADER.
>> THIS WHOLE THING STARTEDAFTER A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTCHER
SHOPS ACROSS PENNSYLVANIASTARTED SELLING DOG AND CAT
MEAT.
IN RESPONSE, HOUSE BILL 1750DESIGNED TO OUTLAW THE HUMAN
CONSUMPTION OF COMMON HOUSEHOLDPETS WAS QUICKLY PUT TOGETHER.
>> THE N.R.A.-OPPOSED BILL NEVERGOT VOTED ON.
>> THE DAY WILL GO THE N.R.A.'SWAY.
>> Stephen: WOO!
WE DID IT!
IT IS STILL LEGAL INPENNSYLVANIA TO SERVE CAT AND
DOG MEAT.
SO YOU'RE SAFE FOR NOW, WHITECASTLE.
(APPLAUSE)NOW, I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH
THE N.R.A., BUT I DO.
ESPECIALLY ABOUT WHY THIS BILLHAD TO DIE.
>> WHEN THE MEASURE WENT TO THESTATE SENATE, AN AMENDMENT WAS
ADDED CALLING FOR A BAN ON LIVEPIGEON SHOOTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AS
WELL.
THAT ATTRACTED CRITICS FROM THENATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION.
>> Stephen: NOW I REALIZE THATSHOOTING A PIGEON ON THE GROUND
MIGHT SEEM LIKE SHOOTING FISH INA BARREL, BUT THERE'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE.
FISH DON'T SCREAM.
ACCORDING TO THE N.R.A.'SWEBSITE, BANNING THE
TIME-HONORED TRADITION OFSHOOTING CAPTIVE PIGEONS MIGHT
BEGIN THE SLIDE DOWN A SLIPPERYSLOPE, AND THE NEXT STOP WILL BE
REGULATED SHOOTING GROUNDS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTTO KILL BIRDS, THE N.R.A.
DEFEATED THIS ANTI-PET-EATINGBILL.
IT'S A HARD BUT NOBLE SACRIFICE.
THE DOGS AND CATS HAVE TO DIE,IN ORDER THAT THE PIGEONS MAY
ALSO DIE.
NOW FOLKS, I DON'T EXPRESSLYCONDONE THE EATING OF PETS.
SURE, YOU MAY SAY, "STEPHEN,WHAT ABOUT YOUR ENDORSEMENT OF
THE POPULAR CHINESE BRAND OFHIGH-END CAT MEAT STEW, "COLONEL
TUXEDO'S HAPPY JOY POWER CATWITH EATING"?
REMEMBER OUR MOTTO:  "RELIABLESTING OF PLEASURE!
TRUSTWORTHY OF LUNCH"!
WELL, I WOULD SAY, GREG, ISTOPPED SELLING THIS PRODUCT
A LONG TIME AGO.
NOW I ONLY DONATE IT TO SCHOOLS.
HAD TO GET RID OF THE STOCK.
THE CANS WERE SWELLING.
BUT SINCE THE N.R.A. WENT TO SOMUCH TROUBLE, I SHOWED MY
SUPPORT BY ORDERING N.R.A.
C.E.O. "WAYNE LAPIERRE'S 101RECIPES FOR YOUR HOUSEHOLD PET."
DON'T THESE SOUND DELICIOUS?
A BEAGLE WITH CREAM CHEESE,GERMAN SHEPHERD'S PIE, OYSTERS
ON THE HALF SHELTIE, AND CHICKENPOODLE SOUP.
IT'S MM-MMM GOOD BOY!
