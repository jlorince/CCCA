BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGESTOUTRAGE OF THE DAY HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH PRESIDENTOBAMA, IT HAD TO DO WITH THE
MAN STANDING A FOOT AWAYFROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
THE SIGN LANGUAGEINTERPRETER USED AT
TUESDAY'S MEMORIAL SERVICEFOR NELSON MANDELA, RIGHT
THERE ON THE STAGE, A FOOTAWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES, BY 9 WAY,IT TURNS OUT IS BEING CALLED
A FAKE BY THE DEAFFEDERATION OF SOUTH AFRICA.
THEY'RE SAYING NOTHING HE ISDOING THERE IS SIGN LANGUAGE.
>> Stephen: COME ON, NONE OFIT WAS SIGN LANGUAGE, FROM
WHERE I'M SITTING IS VERYCLEARLY SAYING-- I DON'T
SPEAK HEBREW BUT MY HEARTGOES OUT TO THOSE WHO DO,
PLEASE HERE, HAVE SOME PIEAND REMEMBER ALWAYS WEAR
YOUR SEAT BELT.
(APPLAUSE)WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
BEATS ME.
I DON'T SPEAK HEBREW EITHER.
NOW IT TURNS OUT THIS GUYHAD PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT
AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESSEVENTS WHERE QUESTIONS HAD
ALSO BEEN RAISED ABOUT HISPROFICIENCY THERE TO WHICH
HE FORMALLY RESPONDED,-- (LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS
AN OUTRAGE TO CRITICIZE THISMAN.
IN YOUR RUSH TO CALL THISGOOD MACHINE A FRAUD DID YOU
EVER STOP TO CONSIDER THATPERHAPS HE WAS TRANSLATING
FOR THE SIGN LANGUAGEIMPAIRED?
ALL THE DEAF PEOPLE OUTTHERE WILL JUST NEVER GOT
AROUND TO USING SIGNLANGUAGE.
BUT STILL WANT TO SEEM LIKETHEY'RE PARTICIPATING.
I MEAN IMAGINE THEIR SENSEOF ISOLATION, THERE ARE DEAD
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVENUNDERSTAND OTHER DEAF
PEOPLE.
BUT NOW THERE'S FINALLYSOMEONE WHO SPEAKS THEIR
MADE UP LANGUAGE.
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THEBRAVE MEMBERS OF THE SIGN
LANGUAGE IMPAIRED COMMUNITY.
I STEPHEN COLBERT, STANDWITH YOU AT THIS DIFFICULT
TIME.
FOR TWO LONG, FOR TWO LONGYOU HAVE HAD NO VOICE.
THERE HAS BEEN NO ONE TOSPEAK FOR YOU.
BUT FROM GREAT HARDSHIPCOMES GREAT STRENGTH.
DID MANDELA NOT TEACH USRECONCILIATION AND
FORGIVENESS?
SO NOW LET EVERYONE IN THEDEAF COMMUNITY JOIN HANDS IN
THE SPIRIT OF BROTHERHOODAND SAY HEY, THAT'S A PRETTY
GOOD BIRD.
