YOU NEVER KNOW HOW IT MIGHT WORKOUT.
>> HE'S TRYING TO FIND IT, IT'SIN HIS GARAGE SOMEPLACE.
>> STEPHEN: ARE THERE A LOT OFOLD FILMS OF YOURS YOU DON'T
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
(LAUGHTER)LOIS, MY KIDS LOVE THIS BOOK.
THIS BOOK HAS BEEN READ MILLIONSAND MILLIONS OF TIMES.
IT'S ASSIGNED IN SCHOOLS.
IS THAT A BADGE OF HONOR THATIT'S ASSIGNED IN SCHOOLS OR,
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, YOU GO, OH,MY GOD!
DON'T MAKE THEM READ IT!
>> WHEN I HEAR FROM KIDS BYEMAIL WHO SAY, TELL ME ALL THE
SIMILES AND METAPHORS IN THEBOOK, I NEED THIS INFORMATION BY
THURSDAY. THEN I HATE IT.
ARE THERE A LOT OF SIMILES ANDMETAPHORS IN THIS BOOK? WHAT I'M
ASKING IS, WILL THIS INTERVIEWBE ON THE TEST?
>> Stephen: IS IT A METAPHORFOR SOMETHING?
FOR THE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHODON'T KNOW THE STORY OF
THE GIVER -- OBVIOUSLY, I DO --(LAUGHTER)
-- TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT IT'SABOUT.
>> IT'S ABOUT AN OLD GUY PLAYEDBY JEFF BRIDGES
WHO HAS AN ENORMOUS JOBTRANSMITTING TO A YOUNG BOY
PLAYED BY BRENTON THWAITES --WHO'S NOT HERE, TOO BAD
HE'S VERY SWEET AND CUTE,TRANSMITTING TO HIM ALL THE
MEMORIES OF THE CULTURE FOR THEWHOLE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: AND THE REASON HEHAS TO DO IT IS, IN THE FUTURE,
THERE IS THIS PLACE CALLED "THECOMMUNITY" AND IN IT THEY DON'T
HAVE MEMORY.
>> THEY HAVE FOUND A WAY TOMANIPULATE HUMAN MEMORY FOR
THEIR PURPOSES.
>> Stephen: IS THAT A GOOD ORBAD THING NOT TO HAVE MEMORY?
BECAUSE THERE IS STUFF I WOULDLIKE TO FORGET.
>> WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO FORGETSOME THINGS.
>> Stephen: HONEST TO GOD. THISGUY FORGOT WHERE HIS FILM WAS
JOHN KLEIN WROTE, TODAY I WALKDOWN THE STREET I USED TO
WANDER, SCRATCHED MY HEAD ANDMADE MYSELF A BET, THERE ARE ALL
THESE THINGS I DON'T THINK IREMEMBER, HOW LUCKY CAN ONE MAN
GET.
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO REMEMBERTHE THINGS THAT HURT US?
>> YOU REMEMBERED FOUR LINES OFPOETRY.
I CAN'T DO THAT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE VALUE?
WHY DOES THIS SOCIETY, THISCOMMUNITY, WHY DO THEY
PURPOSEFULLY INJECT PEOPLE WITHSOMETHING TO MAKE THEM FORGET?
>> THEY'RE GOING FOR PERFECTION.
>> Stephen: IS THAT BAD?
YEAH.
IT DOESN'T WORK.
WE'RE PERFECTLY IMPERFECT, YOUKNOW.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE BLOWING MYMIND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)OKAY.
WHAT DO THEY ACHIEVE?
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOWN SIDES.
WHAT DOES A SOCIETY ACHIEVE?
WHAT ARE THE PROS?
>> THEY ARE COMFORTABLE, SAFE,THEY'RE HAPPY.
>> Stephen: ALL OF THAT SOUNDSPRETTY GOOD, I'VE GOT TO SAY.
I WOULDN'T MIND BEINGCOMFORTABLE AND SAFE AND HAPPY.
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO NOT LOVE?
BECAUSE, AS THE SONG GOES, LOVEHURTS.
♪ LOVE HURTS...♪>> Stephen: LOVE IS A
BATTLEFIELD.
>> OH!
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO YOU HAVE TO SUFFER TO LOVE?
>> SUFFERING IS A PART OF THEWHOLE DEAL, MAN.
IT'S HUMAN.
WHEN YOU TRY TO GET RID OF THAT,IT CAUSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT
PROBLEMS.
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS KIND OFBEAR WITNESS TO OUR SUFFERING
AND TRY TO GET SOME EMPATHY FOREACH OTHER.
>> AND ALONG WITH THE THINGSTHEY GAINED, THE COMFORT AND
HAPPINESS, THEY HAVE LOSTSOMETHING OF THEIR HUMANITY BUT
ALSO THEY LOST ART, MUSIC,LITERATURE.
THERE'S NO BOOKS EXCEPT IN THEPLACE WHERE HE LIVES.
HE LIVES IN A PLACE WITH 22,000BOOKS ON THE SHELVES AND WALLS.
>> I HAVE ONE BEEF WITH THE BOOKAND I'M SURE THE MOVIE, TOO, IS
IT'S A LITTLEANTI-AUTHORITARIAN, OKAY?
IT'S GOT A PROBLEM WITHAUTHORITY, AND I THINK YOU
SHOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT,TOO, BECAUSE SINCE THIS BOOK IS
ASSIGNED, SHOULDN'T KIDS REBELAGAINST AUTHORITY AND REFUSE TO
READ IT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERSTOLD THEM TO?
>> THERE IS THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: "THE GIVER" IN
THEATERS AUGUST 15th.
