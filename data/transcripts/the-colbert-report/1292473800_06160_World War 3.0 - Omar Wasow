THAT ON EBAY.
OF COURSE, SECURITY IS VERY
IMPORTANT, FOLKS, BECAUSE
AMERICA IS AT WAR.
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN.
I'M TALKING ABOUT A WAR THAT THE
NEWS IS STILL COVERING.
JIM.
>> HAS THE U.S. ENTERED A
CYBERWAR?
>> WE'RE SORT OF ENTERED INTO
THIS CYBER WAR.
>> THIS IS A MURKY WORLD OF
CYBER WAR AND IT COULD GET VERY
MESSY.
>> Stephen: WE ARE AT
CYBER WAR, WHICH IS MUCH LIKE
REGULAR WAR, EXCEPT THE
M.R.E.s ARE CHEETOS.
IT STARTED WHEN JULIAN ASSANGE,
THE ABOMINABLE SNOW JOURNALIST,
AND HIS WEB SITE WIKILEAKS,
PUBLISHED THOUSANDS OF
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.
THEN A POWERFUL CYBERATTACK SHUT
DOWN WIKILEAKS.
SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO PLACE TO
SEE THOSE WIKILEAKS DOCUMENTS
EXCEPT EVERYWHERE.
( LAUGHTER ) UNTIL THEN
MASTERCARD AND VISA CUT OFF
CUSTOMER DONATIONS TO WIKILEAKS.
SO ASSANGE'S SUPPORTERS LAUNCHED
A RE-E-TALIATION.
>> A GROUP CALLING ITSELF
"ANONYMOUS" TARGETED THE WEB
SITES OF VISA, MASTERCARD AND
PAYPAL, AMONG OTHERS, AFTER THE
COMPANIES STOPPED PROCESSING
DONATIONS TO WIKILEAKS.
>> THEY USED THIS THING.
IT'S CALLED D.D.O.S.,
DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE.
>> COME ON, ANONYMOUS.
FIRST YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC AND
NOW THIS?
GET IT TOGETHER.
NATION, THESE DENIAL OF SERVICE
STRIKES MAKE ME FURIOUS.
I ASSUME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
I HEAR DENIAL OF SERVICE, AND I
THINK BLACK PERSON AT DENNY'S.
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THE TRUTH IS
FAR MORE TERRIFYING.
>> THE ATTACKER SEARCHES OUT
COMPUTE THERE'S ARE ONLINE AND
UNSECURED AND UNDETECTED TAKES
THEM OVER.
THEN EACH ONE RECRUITS HUNDREDS
OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, AND
TOGETHER ALL THESE HIGH-JACKED
COMPUTERS BOMBARD THE TARGETED
WEB SITE.
IN HACKER SPEAK IT'S CALLED A
ZOMBIE ARMY.
>> Stephen: NICE TRY, HACKERS,
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TURN MY
ELECTRONIC DEVICES AGAINST ME,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET PAST THE BIG
LAYER OF FAT ON MY FAT HEAD YOUR
TELEPROMPTER IS OURS, COLBERT.
DAMMIT, HACKERS!
CAN WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?
TAKE THAT STUFF OUT.
WE'LL EDIT THAT OUT LATER.
THANKFULLY ONE KEY
CYBERINSURGENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE.
>> A 16-YEAR-OLD FROM THE
NEATHERLANDS HAS REPORTEDLY
CONFESSED TO THOSE HACKER
ATTACKS AGAINST VISA AND MASTER
CARD.
>> Stephen: AT LEAST THEY
THINK IT WAS A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY.
WHEN HIS MOM KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR
AND ASKED WHY IT WAS LOCKED, HE
SAID, "I'M HACKING THE
MASTERCARD SITE.
GO AWAY."
EVEN THIS VICTORY HAS A PRICE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THE DUTCH POLICE AND
PROSECUTOR'S WEB SITE THEN
SUFFERED THEIR OWN CYBERATTACK.
OH, NO, WITH THE DUTCH POLICE
CRIPPLED, WHO WILL KEEP THE POT
CAFES OPEN AND THE PROSTITUTES
ON THE STREETS?
LAUGHTER
WELL, FOLKS, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I AM FIGHTING BACK.
YOU SEE, BACK IN THE DAY I WAS A
BIT OF A HACKER MYSELF.
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG, BUT I'M
THE REASON THOME LEE JONES'
WIKIPEDIA PAGE SAYS HE'S
TERRIFIED OF SNOW GLOBES.
OKAY.
GET READY, WIKILEAKS.
YOU ARE STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF A 9600 BAUD SHOTGUN.
[FAX MACHINE NOISES]
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( LAUGHTER )
[CONTINUED FAX MACHINE NOISES]
[REDIALING]
[FAX MACHINE NOISES]
( LAUGHTER )
[FAX MACHINE FAILING NO TO
CONNECT]
>> Stephen: FOR SOME REASON MY
PRODIGY ACCOUNT ISN'T OPENING.
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME, HERE TO
DISCUSS WHAT IS AT STAKE THIS N
THIS CYBERWAR IS THE GUY WHO
TAUGHT OPRAH HOW TO USE THE
INTERNET, OMAR WASOW.
OMAR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
NOW, OMAR, LET'S GET DOWN BRASS
TACKS.
LET'S GET TECH HERE.
ARE WE AT CYBERWAR?
>> YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS A
CONTINUUM.
THESE ARE MORE LIKE CYBERBROTHER
TESTS OR CYBERSIT-INS.
BUT IT COULD ESCALATE.
>> CYBERSIT-INS.
THIS ISN'T A CYBERLOVEFEST.
THEY ARE DESTROYING THESE WEB
SITES.
MASTER CARD, VISA, THEY'RE GONE.
>> THEY ARE TRYING THE USE THESE
TOOLS TO MAKE A POINT, WHICH IS
FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET IS
POTENTIALLY AT RISK WHEN A FEW
COMPANIES CAN ACT AS CHOKE
POINTS.
>> Stephen: FREE SPEECH ISN'T
FREE.
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
I PAY COMCAST IN ORDER TO GET
ON.
HOW IS THAT FREE SPEECH?
AM I AN INTERNET EXPERT NOW?
>> YOU ARE, YOU'RE LIKE AN O.G.,
AN ORIGINAL GEEK.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: I THINK I PROVED
THAT TONIGHT.
( APPLAUSE )
HOW DO THEY TURN MY COMPUTE
ENTIRE A ZOMBIE?
HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT?
ARE THEY GETTING MY PASSWORDS?
>> YOU INSTALL A PIECE OF
SOFTWARE IN YOUR COMPUTER OR
OTHER PEOPLES.
IT'S LIKE IF YOU AND 2,000 OF
YOUR FRIENDS ALL SHOWED UP AT
THE SAME 7-ELEVEN, YOU WOULD
SHUT IT DOWN.
SO YOU FLOOD VISA'S WEB SITE
WITH TRAFFIC AND IT CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE INCOMING WEB REQUESTS.
>> WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP THESE
CYBERCRIMINALS OUT THERE?
SHOULD I... CAN I DO ANYTHING?
IF THEY'RE USING MY COMPUTER,
CAN I FIGHT BACK?
>> YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY INSTALL
THINGS LIKE ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
ON YOUR COMPUTER, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.
>> I INSTALL ANYTHING SOMEONE
E-MAILS TO ME.
>> GAWKER'S WEB SITE WAS HACKED.
IT SHOWED THE NUMBER ONE
PASSWORD WAS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
THE NUMBER TWO PASSWORD WAS
PASSWORD.
>> Stephen: NO ONE IS GOING TO
GUESS MINE BECAUSE IT'S
RAZZLEBERRY.
>> YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE SAFE
WITH THAT, BUT THERE ARE REAL
RISKS.
WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WHEN
RUSSIA WENT TO WAR WITH GEORGIA,
THERE WAS A PARALLEL
CYBERATTACK.
THERE WERE CYBERATTACKS AGAINST
ESTONIA IN 2007.
THIS CAN ESCALATE FROM SIMPLE
DENIAL OF SERVICE TO FLOODING
THE CHANNEL TO THINGS WHERE YOU
TRY THE TAKE DOWN A WHOLE
COUNTRY'S INTERNET.
>> Stephen: IS THE UNITED
STATES PREPARED TO FIGHT THIS
WAR?
IS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES
GOING TO THE APPLE STORE, ASKING
THE PEOPLE AT THE GENIUS BAR HOW
TO WIN THIS WAR?
>> WELL, ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING
THINGS ABOUT THIS IS HOW PRIVATE
FIRST CLASS MANNING WHO IS
ALLEGED TO HAVE GOTTEN THESE
DOCUMENTS.
ONE PERSON TOOK 250,000 PLUS
COME, SO CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, THE
STATE DEPARTMENT, THE ARMY IS
NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF FIGHTING
INTERNALLY.
>>
>> Stephen: LAST QUESTION,
PROBABLY THE MOST VITAL QUESTION
IN THE CYBERWAR, WHAT DOES THE
F-11 KEY DO?
I PUSH IT AND NOTHING HAPPENS.
AM I SHUTTING DOWN WEB SITES IN
EUROPE WHEN I DO THAT?
>> YOU'RE REDIALING, YOUR MODEM
IS GETTING RESET.
>>
>> Stephen: CAN
