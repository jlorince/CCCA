I GOT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT
KIND OF CASH.
FOLKS, I DON'T LIKE WHAT I'M
HEARING PEOPLE SAY ABOUT RICK
PERRY.
HE HAS HAD Açó BAD WEEK LARGELY
BECAUSE OF ONE MOMENT IN
THURSDAY'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
>> I THINK AMERICANS JUST DON'T
KNOW SOMETIMES WHICH MITT ROMNEY
THEY'RE DEALING WITH.
IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT WAS
ON THE SIDE OF... AGAINST THE
SECOND AMENDMENT BEFORE HE WAS
FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
WAS ITÑi IS... BEFORE HE WAS
BEFORE THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS FROM
THE STANDPOINT OF HE WAS FAR...
STANDING FUN FOR "ROE V. WADE"
BEFORE HE WAS AGAINST "ROE V.
WADE."
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOUÑi GET
WHEN YOUR HEAD SPEECH WRITER IS
MAGNETIC POETRY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
AND FOLKS, FOLLOWING THIS
DEBACLE, THE LONG FIVES ARE OUT.
>> PERRY DID A LOT OF DAMAGE TO
HIMSELF.
>> HE WAS NOT READY.
>> YIKES, THAT WAS THE ONE WORD
HEADLINE.
>> PERRY REALLY DID THROW UP ALL
OVER HIMSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS,
BRITT, THANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I'D GO EVEN FURTHER.
PERRY THREW UP ALL OVER HIMSELF
THEN CHOPPED OFF HIS OWN HEAD
AND CRAPPED DOWN HIS OWN NECK
HOLE.
(LAUGHTER)
TORE UP HIS BELLY AND NAILED HIS
INTESTINES TO A TREE AND RANÑi
AROUND IT UNTIL HE UNRAVELED HIS
OWN GUTS.
HE DEFILED HIMSELF WITH EVERY
BODILY FLUID KNOWN TO MAN OTHER
THAN SANTORUM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)Ñi
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE
THE HORRIFIC NATURE OF PERRY'S
DEBATE PERFORMANCE.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT IT AGAIN.
JIMMY, I BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER
ANGLE.
>> WAS IT WAS BEFORE... IT WAS
BEFORE...
(LAUGHTER)
OH, THAT A GAS.
AND PERRY'S OPPONENTS HAVE BEEN
QUICK TO CAPITALIZE ON IT.
IF YOU NOTICE-- AND I SWEAR I AM
NOT MAKING THIS UP-- THAT
YOUTUBE FOOTAGE PAID FOR BY MITT
ROMNEY FOR PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
AT THIS POINT THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING TO SAY ABOUT PERRY-- I
LIKE THIS GUY.
BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS WEEKEND HE
DID NOT RUN AWAY FROM HIS DEBATE
PERFORMANCE, HE OWNED IT!
>> IT'S NOT WHO IS THE SLICKEST
CANDIDATE OR THE SMOOTHEST
DEBATER THAT WE NEED TO ELECT
>> WHAT AMERICANS ARE LOOKING
FOR ISN'T THE SLICKEST
CANDIDATE.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN AUTHENTIC
PRINCIPALED LEADER.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
SO WHAT IF HE'S NOT A SLICK
TALKER.
SOME OF OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS
HAVE BEEN TONGUE TIED ON
OCCASIONS.
HOW SOON WE FORGET THIS.
>> FOOL ME ONCE...
(LAUGHTER)
... SHAME ON... SHAME ON YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
FOOL F YOU FOOL ME, YOU CAN'T
GET FOOLED AGAIN!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IS THAT
INTELLIGIBLE?
NO!
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE FEVERED
RAMBLINGS OF A SYPHILITIC BRAIN!
BUT HE WAS AUTHENTIC!
SO WHAT IF RICK PERRY THREW UP
ALL OVER HIMSELF.
GEORGE H.W. BUSH THREW UP ALL
OVER HIMSELF AND THE PRIME
MINISTER OF JAPAN!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS WHAT'S CALLED TRICKLE
DOWN!
(LAUGHTER)
A PRESIDENT DOES NOT NEED TO BE
ARTICULATE.
WHEN THE MOMENT OF TRUTH COMES,
HE PUSHES THE BUTTON.
HE DOESN'T CONVINCE THE BUTTON
TO PUSH ITSELF.
HE'S NOT THE CONVINCER IN CHIEF,
HE'S THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
AND BY "COMMAND" I DON'T MEAN OF
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AMERICA IS CLEARLY ON THIS
WITH... WITH ME ON ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CLEARLY AMERICA IS WITH ME ON
THIS ONE!
CNN'S POLL AFTER HIS
MUMBLE-MOUTHED TRAIN WRECK GIVES
PERRY AN EIGHT-POINT LEAD.
CLEARLY HE NEEDS TO SHOW UP AT
THE NEXT DEBATE WITH A MOUTHFUL
OF ANGRY BEES.
(LAUGHTER)ñr
AND WHILE BACHMANN HAS IOWA AND
ROOMNY IS STRONG IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE, MY HOME STATE OF
SOUTH CAROLINA LOVES RICK
PERRY-- ANDÑi THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
FOLKS, BECAUSE SOUTH CAROLINA IS
THE THIRD PRIMARY STATE BUT
ARIZONA GOVERNOR JANUARY CREWER
HAS ANNOUNCED SHE IS MOVING
THEIR PRIMARY UP TO FEBRUARY 28,
SOUTH CAROLINA'S DATE!
WELL, GOVERNOR BREWER HAS MESSED
WITH THE WRONG STEPHEN COLBERT.
THIS ONE!ñr
SHE SAYS SHE'S DOING IT SO THAT
SOUTHWESTERN ISSUES ARE
ADDRESSED BY THE CANDIDATES IN A
MEANINGFUL FASHION.
OH, YEAH, IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA
TO HAVE A SERIOUS DEBATE ON
WHETHER IT'S CACTUSES OR CACTI.
(BLEEP), JAN!
THIS IS ABOUT THE MONEY!Ñi
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THATñr
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SPEND UP
TO 75% OF THEIR CAMPAIGN BUDGETS
ON THE FIRST FEW PRIMARY STATES.
BUYING ADS, TRANSPORTATION,
LODGING.
IT'S AN ORGY OF SPENDING AND
SOUTH CAROLINA IS SUPPOSED STOP
THE LUCKY PIERRE IN THAT
MONETARY ASS PILE.
BUT ARIZONA IS MUSCLING IN.
AND NOW MICHIGAN HAS PASSED A
BILL MOVING THEIR PRIMARY TO
FEBRUARY 28 AND FLORIDA WANTS TO
MOVE THEIRS EVEN EARLIER THAN
THAT!
NOW, FLORIDA GOING EARLIER MAKES
SENSE.
WHEN YOUR AVERAGE VOTER IS 93,
EVERY SECOND COUNTS.
(APPLAUSE)
WELL, FOLKS, SOUTH CAROLINA
VOTERS REFUSED TO BE TREATED
LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS.
STATE REPUBLICAN CHAIR CHAD
CONNOLLY TOLD "U.S.A. TODAY"
"WE'RE GOING TO BE FIRST IN THE
SOUTH AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO
SHARE OUR DATE WITH ANYBODY,
ESPECIALLY A STATE THAT BREAKS
THE RULES."
YEAH!
SOUTH CAROLINA HAS PROVEN THAT
UNLESS YOU PLAY BY THEIR RULES
THEY WILL TAKE THEIR STATE AND
GO HOME!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, I SAY I SAY IN ALL THAT
CAMPAIGN CASH IS ATTRACTING ALL
THE EARLY PRIMARIES, LET'S MAKE
SURE SOUTH CAROLINA GETS ALL
THAT CAMPAIGN CASH BY LETTING
THE CASH DECIDE THE PRIMARY.
JUST DO AWAY WITH THE VOTING AND
GIVE ALL OUR DELEGATES TO
WHOEVER SPENDS THE MOST MONEY!
ON PRIMARY DAY, CAMPAIGNS JUST
HAND IN THEIR RECEIPTS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WAY, UNLIKE ELECTRONIC
VOTING, AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE A
PAPER TRAIL.
(LAUGHTER)
TO PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS, SOUTH
CAROLINA, AS LONG AS WE'RE
DECIDING PRESIDENTIAL BIDS,
SHOULDN'T WE GIVE OUR STATE TO
THE HIGHEST BIDDER?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
