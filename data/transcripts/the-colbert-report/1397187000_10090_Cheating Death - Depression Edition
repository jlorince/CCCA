( LAUGHTER )NATION, WEDDING VOWS ARE
SUPPOSED TO LAST TILL DEATH DOUS PART, BUT WITH TODAY'S
DIVORCE RATE, SADLY, HALF OFMARRIAGES DON'T END IN DEATH.
THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITHSTEPHEN T. COLBERT, D.F.A.
>> YES, SIR, WHERE'S THE PRETTYLADY?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  DEPRESSIONEDITION.
FIRST UP, FOLKS, A DISCLAIMEREYE AM NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR.
I HAVE AN HONORARY DOCTORATE INFINE ARTS SO I CAN'T CURE YOUR
BLINDNESS, BUT I CAN OPEN YOUREYES TO THE GRAND MINIMALISM OF
RICHARD SERRA'S SCULPTURES.
AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH ISBROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT
PHARMACEUTICALS.
PRESCOTT:  WHERE MALPRACTICEMAKES MALPERFECT.
( APPLAUSE )FIRST NEXT UP, MENTAL HEALTH.
FOLKS, THIS COUNTRY HAS ASERIOUS DEPRESSION PROBLEM.
ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTHORGANIZATION, NEARLY 20% OF
AMERICANS REPORT AN EXTENDEDPERIOD OF DEPRESSION IN THEIR
LIFETIME.
WHILE THE OTHER 80% INSIST THATEVERYTHING IS OKAY.
SHUT UP, DADDY'S DRINKING.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
, AND, SURE, THERE ARETREATMENTS LIKE PROZAC, PAXIL,
AND ZOLOFT, BUT YOU CANNOTINJECT THEM INTO YOUR FACE.
>> BOTOX IS THE MOST POPULARCOSMETIC ENHANCEMENT PROCEDURE
IN THE COUNTRY.
A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS BOTOX COULDALSO BE USEFUL FOR A TREATMENT
OPTION FOR DEPRESSION.
THE THINKING IS FROWNING SENDSNEGATIVE EMOTIONAL SIGNALS TO
THE BRAIN SO INHIBITING THEABILITY TO FROWN WOULD INHIBIT
THE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, WHEN ILEARNED THAT BOTOX CAN CURE
DEPRESSION, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEENTHE EXPRESSION ON MY FACE.
OR ANY EXPRESSION ON THE FACE OFSOMEONE WITH BOTOX.
CHEERING YOU UP BY KILLING YOURFACE WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A
CIRCUIT BETWEEN THE BRAIN ANDTHE MUSCLES OF FACIAL
EXPRESSION, IN WHICH THE BRAINMONITORS THE EMOTIONAL VALENCE
OF THE FACE AND RESPONDS BYGENERATING THE APPROPRIATE
FEELING.
WELL, OF COURSE, YOUR FACE TELLSYOUR BRAIN HOW IT FEEL.
YOUR FACE-BRAIN IS MUCH SMARTERTHAN YOUR SKULL-BRAIN AND YOU
KNOW THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE MY FACEJUST SAID IT.
THIS PROCEDURE IS NOT ONLYEFFECTIVE, FOLKS.
IT IS FAR LESS INVASIVE THAN THEPREVIOUS COSMETIC TREATMENT FOR
DEPRESSION-- RECONSTRUCTIVESURGERY TO TURN THAT FROWN
UPSIDE DOWN.
THAT GUY LOOKS HAPPY.
FOLKS, THERE'S ONLY ONE DOWNSIDETO THIS MIRACULOUS CURE FOR
DEPRESSION-- BOTOX CAN ALSO MAKEYOU FEEL DEPRESSED BECAUSE YOU
CANNOT SMILE PROPERLY.
WHICH THEN COULD MAKE YOU VERYSAD, BUT FORTUNATELY, YOU CAN
ALSO NO LONGER FROWN.
BUT PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALSKNOWS THAT YOUR EMOTIONAL
PROBLEMS GO WELL BEYOND JUSTHAPPINESS AND DEPRESSION.
THAT'S WHY PRESCOTT IS PROUD TOINTRODUCE VACSA-MEH.
BECAUSE WHY PARALYZE YOUR FACEFROM SHOWING EMOTIONS WHEN YOU
CAN PARALYZE THE EMOTIONSTHEMSELVES?
EVERY SYRINGE CONTAINS THE SAMETOXIN AS BOTOX, BUT WITH AN
EIGHT-INCH NEEDLE THAT ALLOWSYOU TO INJECT IT DIRECTLY INTO
YOUR BRAIN.
WHEN YOU FEEL A TINGLING, THATMEANS IT'S WORKING.
WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING ATALL, THAT MEANS IT WORKED.
( LAUGHTER )SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-MEH
INCLUDE SEARCH AND SEIZURES.
MALE PATTERN BALDWIN, ANDHIPSTER DYSPLASIA, AND VACSA-MEH
IS 100% GUARANTEED TO WORK, ANDWHEN IT DOESN'T, THERE'S ANOTHER
SOLUTION IN-- MENTAL HEALTH.
BECAUSE THERE IS YET ANOTHERCURE FOR DEPRESSION.
>> BATTLING LONG-TERMDEPRESSION, OXFORD UNIVERSITY
RESEARCHERS TREATED 38 PEOPLEWITH THE DRUG KETAMINE FOR MORE
THAN THREE WEEKS.
30% SAW THEIR DEPRESSIVESYMPTOMS LESSEN.
EIGHT PEOPLE REPORTED FEELINGFREE OF DEPRESSION.
KETAMINE IS ALSO USED AS A HORSETRANQUILIZER
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  IT MAKES SENSE.
FOLKS--( APPLAUSE )

TRANQUILIZER BECAUSE EVERY TIMEI SEE A HORSE I SAY, "WHY THE
LONG FACE?"( APPLAUSE )

AND THIS VETERINARY DRUG ISN'TJUST USED TO ANIMALS, FOLKS.
IT'S ALSO USED ON PARTY ANIMALS.
>> KETAMINE IS A GENERALANESTHETIC OFTEN USED BY
VETERINARIANS.
WHEN TAPE IN HIGH DOSES AT THECLUB SCENE, USERS SAY THEY FEEL
DETACHED AND ALMOST HALLUCINATE.
>> KETAMINE IS ALSO USED AT THEDRUG SCENE AS A PARTY DRUG.
WE HAVE SOME FOOT  OF THECLINICAL TRIALS.
THAT THAT-- THAT WAS THE CONTROLGROUP.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY,
KETAMINE TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OFTHE NEUROTRANSMITTER GLUTAMATE
IN THE BRAIN, WHICH STIMULATESTHE GROWTH OF SYNAPSES THAT HAVE
BEEN DAMAGED BY STRESS.
PUT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, OXFORDUNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS HAVE
DETERMINED THAT DRUGS MAKE YOUFEEL GOOD SO YOU SHOULD TAKE
THEM, WHICH IS WHY PRESCOTT HASREPURPOSED ITS OWN LIQUID
ANTIDEPRESSION PARTY MEDICATION-- VAC DANIELS.
