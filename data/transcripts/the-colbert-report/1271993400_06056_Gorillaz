EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT ARE MEMBERS OF
THE BAND GORILLAZ.
I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THE ZOO...

I HAVE A PHONE CALL?
I'M DOING THE SHOW RIGHT NOW.
DOES THIS REALLY... IT DOES?
OKAY.
HELLO?
>> OH, HI.
YEAH, STEVE CORBETT.
IT'S MURDOC NICALLS HERE.
I UNDERSTAND YOU BOOKED MY BAND
TO PLAY TODAY.
I HAVE TO CLEAR SOMETHING UP.
THEY'RE NOT GORILLAS.
TIME REAL GORILLAZ.
THE BANDS YOU SEE HERE ARE THE
ONES I HIRED TO PLAY AT
COACHELLA.
AT THE LAST MINUTE I GOT BOOTED
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
APPARENTLY, SEE, YOU NEED A WORK
VISA TO PLAY HERE.
I DIDN'T HAVE MINE SORTED IN
TIME.
ANYWAY, BYE, STEVE.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
HELLO?
THE REAL BAND GORILLAZ ISN'T
HERE?
THEY SENT AROUND DAMON ALBARN?
HE'S IN BLUR.
AND JAMIE HEWLETT, HE'S AN
ANIMATOR.
HE CREATED "TANK GIRLS."
I BOOKED THE BAND.

HE SAID HE'S THE REAL HOST AND
HE WOULD ONLY INTERVIEW THE REAL
BAND, SO THEY SENT ME.
AND THIS IS COOL.
>> OKAY.

I'M A HUGE FAN OF ALL YOUR
STUFF.
I LOVE "TANK GIRL" AND I LOVE
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
I LOVE THAT WOO SPTION H OO O
SONG.
THIS IS GREAT.
STEPHEN LEFT ME HIS QUESTIONS.
THE FIRST ONE WAS, WHO THE
[BLEEP] DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
DO YOU WANT TO... I DON'T KNOW.
WHO WANTS THE FIELD THAT ONE?
DO YOU WANT TO FIELD THAT ONE?
NO?
OKAY.
OKAY.
SECOND ONE WAS, THE BAND IS A
CAR TUNE, RIGHT, CARTOON BAND?
DO YOU GET REAL GROUP PIS, OR DO
YOU GET CAR TUNE GROUPIES?
AND THE FOULUP IS, WHAT'S IT
LIKE TO BE KNEE-DEEP IN TOON
TIME?
DOES THAT HAPPEN?
>> FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT
BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT INTERSPECIES RELATIONSHIPS
WERE A VERY GOOD THING.
>> REALLY.
SO SOME OF THE CARTOONS YOU HAVE
SEX WITH AREN'T EVEN CAR TOON
PEOPLE?
>> YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF
CARL YUNG.
>> ABSOLUTELY, YES.
>> DAIMON.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND I SUPPOSE WE KIND OF
MANIFEST OURS IN THE CARTOONS.
>> WELL, THAT'S FASCINATING.
>> YEAH, IT IS.
>> SO IT'S ACTUALLY A DEEP,
PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNING TO
THE FACT THAT THE BAND ACTUALLY
HAS A PERSONA THAT IS CREATED
FOR THE AUDIENCE SINCE ALL BANDS
TRULY HAVE A PERSONA, CORRECT?
>> THAT PART.
>> WU.
THIS IS FASCINATING.
YOU'RE COLLABORATING WITH SOME
AMAZING PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE BOBBY WOMACK.
>> WE HAVE.
>> HE'S ON THIS ALBUM.
AND A COUPLE OF FORMER MEMBERS
OF THE CLASH.
THEY'RE HERE TONIGHT, TOO?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THE IN UH ALBUM IS CALLED
"PLASTIC BEACH."
IS SUSAN BOYLE ON THIS ALBUM?
>> NO.
>> BECAUSE THAT APPEARS TO BE
THE ONLY ENGLISH SINGER THAT
AMERICANS CARE ABOUT RIGHT NOW.
>> THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
>> STEPHEN HATES YOU NOW, BUT I
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A SONG.
DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS||||||
