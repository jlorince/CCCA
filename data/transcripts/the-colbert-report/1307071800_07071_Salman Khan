>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,

EVERYONE IN THE WORLD.
BIG DEAL.
I DO THAT EVERY NIGHT.
PLEASE WELCOME SALOMON KUAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MR. KUAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
PLEASE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: LET'S EXPLAIN TO
THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY
NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITHOUT DO KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
HOW MANY STUDENTS HAVE YOU
TAUGHT SO FAR.
>> WE HAVE, WE HAVE
DELIVERED OVER 50 MILLION
LESSONS.
>> Stephen: 50 MILLION
LESSONS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BY WE IS IT YOU?
>> I'M RIGHT NOW THE
FACULTY.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: THE SOLE
FACULTY.
>> RIGHT NOW.
YEAH.
RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
DO YOU PAY YOURSELF ANYTHING?
>> I USED TO, WELL, IT
STARTED OFF I WAS HELPING
OUT MY COUSINS AND I HAD
ANOTHER JOB AND THEY WERE --
>> HEDGE FUND GUYS.
>> I USED TO WORK AT A HEDGE
FUND.
>> DEGREE FROM MIT, A DEGREE
FROM HARVARD.
YOU WERE ON HEDGE FUND, CHA
CHING, PULLING IN CASH,
RIGHT.
>> YES.
>> BUT I WAS TUTORING MY
COUSINS IN NEW ORLEANS AND I
HAD A BUNCH OF COUSINS, ONES
THAT WORKED WITH ONE COUSIN,
I STARTED TUTORING MORE AND
MORE.
A FRIEND SAID INSTEAD OF
DOING THESE SEPARATE
SESSIONS AND YOU HAVE TO
REPEAT THE SEPARATE LECTURE
WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ON
YOUTUBE SO I STARTED DOING
THAT.
I WAS DOING IN MYS CLOSET
FOR A WHILE AND FAST FORWARD
TO 2009, I QUIT MY JOB AND
NOW WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT.
WE HAVE FUNDING SO I AM
TAKING A SALARY, THAT'S MY
ANSWER.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO YOU ARE GETTING PAID
SOMETHING.
>> I AM GETTING PAID
SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: MORE TO DO THIS
OR MORE TO BE A HEDGE FUND
MANAGER?
>> MORE TO BE A HEDGE FUND
MANAGER.
I'M NOT A HEDGE FUND MANAGER
BUT I'M GETTING PAID LESS
NOW.
>> Stephen: YES.
WHAT KIND OF ECONOMIC LESSON
IS THAT TO THIS SHOW.
>> YEAH, NO, IT'S-- I WILL
THINK ABOUT THAT ONE A
LITTLE BIT BUT YEAH, NO, I'M
HAPPIER NOW SO BECAUSE I'M
GETTING TO MAKE INTERESTING
LESSONS.
>> Stephen: GIVE THE PEOPLE
AT HOME AN EXAMPLE, THIS IS
A LITTLE MONTAGE OF SEVERAL
LESSONS.
IT GIVES AN IDEA OF THE SORT
OF VIDEOS YOU SEE AND THE
WAY YOU TEACH PEOPLE ON THE
INTERNET.
JIM?
>> SO THE HYPOTENUSE IS NOW
GOING TO BE FIVE.
THIS ANIMAL'S FOSSILS ARE
ONLY FOUND IN THIS AREA OF
SOUTH AMERICA.
NICE CLEAN BAND HERE.
AND THIS PART OF AFRICA.
WE COULD INTEGRATE OVER THE
SURFACE IN THE NO
NATION-- NOTATION TURBLY IS
A CAPITAL SIGMA, NATIONAL
ASSEMBLY, THEY CREATE THE
COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY.
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A VERY
NICE COMMITTEE.
NOTICE THIS IS AN ALDAHYDE
AND AN ALCOHOL.
>> INTO AN EFFECTER AND
MEMORY SELLS.
>> A GAL AX THERE IS ANOTHER
GALAXY.
>> AND FOR DOLLARS IS THERE
30 MILLION PLUS THE 20
MILLION FROM THE AMERICAN
MANUFACTURER.
IF THIS DOES NOT BLOW YOUR
MIND, THEN YOU HAVE NO
EMOTION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO THAT'S NOT
THE MOST STANDARD WAY OF
TEACHING I'VE EVER SEEN.
>> NO, I MEAN I WAS DOING
FOR MY COUSINS AND YOU KNOW,
THEY WEREN'T PAYING ME SO I
JUST KIND OF DO IT VERY
CONVERSATIONALLY.
THEY ARE FEEDBACK WAS THAT
THEY LIKED ME BETTER ON
YOUTUBE THAN IN PERSON.
>> Stephen: .
>> FACE DOES NOT APPEAR T IS
JUST VOICE AND WRITING.
>> Stephen: AND DO YOU
HAPPEN TO AGREE-- HAVE A
DEGREE IN EDUCATION.
>> I DON'T HAVE A DEGREE IN
EDUCATION.
>> Stephen: COULD
YOU-- COULD YOU-- YOU COULD
TEACH A CLASS IN EDUCATION
AND THEN TAKE IT YOURSELF SO
YOU COULD HAVE ONE?
>> I WILL NO, BUT
POTENTIALLY I WILL THINK
ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: I LIKE THAT
ABOUT YOU.
BECAUSE I'M NO FAN OF
EXPERTS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND YOU-- AND
YOU GET TO GO OUT THERE AND
BASICALLY JUST SAY HEY,
TRUST ME THIS IS THE WAY THE
WORLD WORKS, RIGHT.
>> EXACTLY, NO, EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: I DO THAT KIND
OF STUFF ON THIS TUBE EVERY
NIGHT.
BY THE WAY, THERE IS NO SUCH
THING AS NEGATIVE NUMBERS.
CAN'T HAVE LESS THAN 0,
RIGHT.
>> NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: ALSO PII
EVENTUALLY DOES END.
BECAUSE IF IT WAS INFINITE
THE WORLD WOULD FILL WITH
NUMBERS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT?
CAN I TEACH FOR YOUR
UNIVERSITY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE WOULD LOVE THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HOW LONG DO
THESE LESSONS LAST?
>> MOST OF THEM ARE ABOUT 10
MINUTES.
SOME ARE A LITTLE LONGER,
SOME A LITTLE SHORTER THAT
IS WHAT YOUTUBE LIMITED ME
TO INITIALLY AND PEOPLE SAID
THEY LIKE IT BECAUSE THAT IS
ABOUT HOW LONG YOU CAN KROL
FOCUS ON SOMETHING.
SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE HAVE
RESEARCHERS SAID THAT IS HOW
LONG PEOPLE CAN PAY
ATTENTION.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY OF
THESE VIDEOS HAVE YOU MADE.
>> THERE'S 2300 VIDEOS.
>> Stephen: YOU MADE 2300
VIDEOS.
BUT THAT IS TEACHING MORE
COURSES THAN MOST PEOPLE CAN
EVER TAKE IN THEIR LIFE.
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR
INFORMATION.
I MEAN DO YOU KNOW ALL THESE
THINGS BEFORE YOU TEACH IT
OR DOW TEACH YOURSELF FIRST.
>> SORT OF LIKE, THE STUFF I
STARTED OFF WITH LIKE THE
MATH AND PHYSICS AND
ECONOMICS, THAT WAS KIND OF
PIE BACKGROUND SO THOSE I
KIND OF JUST DID.
BUT NOW WHEN I DO FRENCH
REVOLUTION I DO LOOK ON WICK
PEDESTRIANIA AND READ UP ON
IT.
I DO.
>> Stephen: WIKAPEDIA.
>> WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: YOU DO SOME
HEAVY RESEARCH.
>> I DO.
AND I CLICK ON THE FOOTNOTES,
THOUGH, I MAKE SURE.
I'M RESPONSIBLE.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT, DO YOU
HAVE AN OBJECTIVE WITH THE
KUAN ACADEMY?
>> YOU KNOW, I AM KEEPING ON
MAKING VIDEOS.
WE'RE TRANSLATING THEM INTO
TEN LANGUAGES.
BUILDING OUT THIS SOFTWARE
PIECE SO PEOPLE CAN GET
EXERCISES.
THEY'RE USING THEM THIS
SCHOOLS.
THE IDEA IS ANYONE ANYWHERE
WITH AN INTERNET CONNECTION
WITH USE THIS TO LEARN
ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: WHERE DO YOU GET
YOUR MONEY?
>> WE ARE, WE GET IT FROM
DONATIONS.
>> Stephen: FROM?
WHO IS-- YOU GOT A SUGAR
DADDY?
>> YOU KNOW, OUR TWO BIGGEST
DONORS SO FAR HAVE BEEN
GOOGLE AND BILL GATES
THROUGH THE GATES FOUNDATION
AND WE HAVE A FEW MORE THAT
HAVE BEEN HELPING US OUT.
>> Stephen: IF PEOPLE WATCH
THESE VIDEOS AT HOME, WHY DO
WE NEED TEACHERS?
THAT IS ANOTHER THING, WE
CAN CRUSH THOSE WISCONSIN
TEACHERS WITH THIS, RIGHT?
>> AND THIS IS WHAT WE-- IF
I'M A TEACHER I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE THE SAME LECTURE T
IS CRAZY TO HAVE EVERYONE
GIVING THE SAME LECTURE, DOW
IT ONE TIME.
SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN
CLASSROOMS IS IT IS KIND OF
LIBERATING TEACHERS.
INSTEAD OF GIVING A ONE SIZE
FITS ALL LECTURE TO A BUNCH
OF STUDENTS, NOW THEY CAN
ASSIGN THIS AS HOMEWORK AND
THE KIDS CAN COME NOT CLASS
AND DO HOMEWORK THERE AND
ACTUALLY INTERACT AND TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT
THERE IS ACTUALLY PEOPLE IN
THE ROOM THERE THAT YOU CAN
GET HELP FROM.
>> Stephen: SO HOMEWORK
BOOKS ROOM WORK AND AT HOME
YOU GET TO WATCH YOUTUBE.
>> YES, YES, EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE
THE GREATEST SCHOOL I'VE
EVER HEARD OF.
MR. SALOMON KUAN, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FROM THE KUAN
