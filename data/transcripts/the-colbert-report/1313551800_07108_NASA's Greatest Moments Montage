(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
NATION, IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS
I'LL BE SITTING DOWN THE VERY
LAST CREW OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE
"ATLANTIS."
TO MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME, WE
HAVE REPLACED THE GREEN ROOM
TOILET WITH A BROKEN DYSON
VACUUM.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THAT AMERICA HAS HUNG UP ITS
ASTRO SPURS, COUNTRIES LIKE
INDIA AND CHINA HAVE SAID
THEY'RE GOING TO THE MOON.
WELL, I SAY BACK OFF, OTHER
COUNTRIES!
THAT IS OUR MOON, WE LICKED IT.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, PERHAPS YOU FORGOT OUR
NATION'S PROUD LUNAR HISTORY,
WHEN AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS LANCE
ARMSTRONG AND BUZZ LIGHT-YEAR
LANDED ON THE MOON AND SAID
THOSE IMMORTAL WORDS "WHERE'S
THE BEEF?"
(LAUGHTER)
I'D SAY IF WE CAN'T GO TO SPACE
THAN NOBODY CAN.
IT'S TIME TO NUKE THE MOON!
(LAUGHTER)
BESIDES HELPING AMERICA STAY
NUMBER ONE, IT WILL ALSO GREATLY
REDUCE WEREWOLF ATTACKS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO SPACE PROGRAM, WE BID YOU A
FOND FAIR WELL AS WE LOOK BACK
AT SOME OF NASA'S GREATEST
MOMENTS.
>> THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THERE'S NO DOUBT...
THIS GOES OUT TO MY HOMIES AT
NASA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE
CREW FROM THE SPACE SHUTTLE
"ATLANTIS."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
