I ALREADY KNOW THEY DROPPED A
HOUSE ON A WITCH AND YOU KNOW
SHE'S IN THE 1%.
THE POINT IS, FOLKS, I'M FED UP
WITH PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN
LAZE AROUND AND BE A DRAIN ON
SOCIETY.
I DON'T DO THAT.
I WORK HARD TO BE A DRAIN ON
SOCIETY.
(LAUGHTER)
TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT AND
FALSIFIED PAPERWORK TO COLLECT
VETERANS BENEFITS.
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
ASK 90-YEAR-OLD D-DAY VETERAN
COLBERT T. STEVENSON.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SIR.
FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE HEROES
OUT THERE LOOKING OUT FOR THE
REST OF US.
TONIGHT WE SALUTE ONE.
>> SOCIETY REQUIRES LAWS IN
ORDER.
POLICEMEN ARE THE HEROES WHO
UPHOLD THAT ORDER.
BUT EVEN THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKE.
>> NEW CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED
AGAINST THE PLIFRP WHO ADMITS TO
CONFISCATING MARIJUANA AND THEN
BAKING IT IN BROWNIES.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE
BROWNIES AND I THINK TIME IS
GOING BY REALLY, REALLY, REALLY
SLOW.
>> SO WHEN THE POLICE FALL DOWN
ON THE JOB, WHO STANDS UP FOR
US?
MEET JIMMY JUSTICE.
>> I ONLY CARRY A VIDEO CAMERA
WITH ME WHEREVER I GO AND ANY
TIME I SEE A POLICE OFFICER
DOING SOMETHING WRONG, I CAN
FILM IT AND PUT IT ON YOUTUBE
FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.
>> YOU JUST BROKE THE LAW!
>> JIMMY'S GOTCHA VIDEOS HAVE
GARNERED MILLIONS OF HITS ON
YOUTUBE.
ENOUGH TO EARN JIMMY JUSTICE THE
TITLE "DIFFERENCE MAKER."
WHO IS JIMMY JUSTICE?
>> I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE NEW
YORKER WHO'S SICK AND TIRED OF
WATCHING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
ABUSE THEIR POWER, ABUSE THEIR
AUTHORITY SUPERMAN WAS A
CHILDHOOD HERO OF MINE AND HE
WOULD STAND UP FOR JUSTICE.
>> LIKE EVERY SUPERHERO, JIMMY
JUSTICE HAS A UNIQUE ABILITY.
WHAT IS JIMMY'S SUPERPOWER?
>> JIMMY JUSTICE' REALLY, REALLY
ANNOYING.
>> YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO COVER
YOUR BADGE.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO COVER YOUR
BADGE!
HE HAS A CAMERA!
OH, THAT'S DANGEROUS!
I'M CALLING FOR BACKUP.
WAHH!
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO WEAR
THAT?
HIDE YOUR FACE!
I ALREADY GOT YOUR FACE ON
VIDEO!
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, BITE
ME WITH YOUR GOLD TOOTH?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
WEARING A PEA COAT.
IT'S A LITTLE SECRETIVE.
WAAH.
YOUR DAYS OF RUNNING AROUND THIS
CITY LIKE A COWBOY ARE OVER!
I AM JIMMY JUSTICE!
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> JIMMY HAS BEEN THE DYNAMIC
DOUCHEBAG FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN
REMEMBER.
>> I'VE BEEN CALLED A PEST, A
GADFLY, AN ASS (BLEEP), A PIECE
OF CRAP.
DOESN'T DETERMINE ME IN ANY WAY,
SHAPE, OR FORM.
>> LIKE ALL SUPERHEROES, JIMMY
LEADS A DOUBLE LIFE.
BY DAY HE'S A MILD-MANNERED
AUDIO SYSTEMS ENGINEER.
BUT BY SLIGHTLY LATER IN THE DAY
HE'S A STALKER OF POLICE.
AND, OF COURSE, HE HAS A TRUSTY
SIDEKICK.
>> I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT JIMMY
JUSTICE'S SIDEKICK.
>> JUST WHAT A SIDEKICK WOULD
SAY.
A SIDEKICK CONCERNED FOR JIMMY'S
SAFETY.
>> I SAW THESE VIDEOS AND THE
FIRST THING I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS,
WOW, ONE DAY SOMEBODY'S GOING TO
KICK HIS ASS.
>> OH, BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO
BE EASY.
TELL THEM WHY, JIMMY.
>> I'M TRAINED IN JUDO AND
JUJITSU AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF
SOMEBODY TRYING TO KICK MY ASS.
>> YEAH!
BRING IT ON!
(LAUGHTER)
I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED.
I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING THIS AS
LONG AS I HAVE TO.
>> AND LIKE MANY SUPERHEROES...
>> WHO IS SPIDER-MAN?
HE'S A CRIMINAL.
>> JIMMY JUSTICE IS OFTEN
MISUNDERSTOOD.
>> I THINK JIMMY JUSTICE IS A
BOOB.
>> DON'T YOU MEAN SUPERBOOB?
>> I THINK JIMMY JOHNSON IS
OBNOXIOUS AND BORDERLINE
COMMITTING CRIMES WHILE HE'S
DOING HIS VIDEO.
>> WHEN I CATCH COPS VIOLATING
THE LAW I ALWAYS TRY TO BE
RESPECTFUL.
>> ARE YOU RETARDD?
ARE YOU ON DRUGS?
YOU BROKE THE LAW!
YOU ANIMAL.
>> BEING REALLY ANNOYING IS NOT
A GOOD IDEA.
>> WHY NOT
>> IT'S NOT PROFESSIONAL, IT'S
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.
>> BUT SOMETIMES IT WORKS.
>> NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE.
>> SOMETIMES IT WORKS.
>> NO, I'VE NOT SEEN IT WORK
BEFORE.
>> SOMETIMES.
>> NO.
>> ANY TIME?
>> NO, NEVER.
>> WELL, SOMETIMES, BUT CLEARLY
JIMMY'S DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
>> THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE
PUBLIC AGREE WITH ME.
90% OF THE MAIL THAT I GET IS
POSITIVE AND ENCOURAGING AND
ONLY 10% ARE DEATH THREATS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WITH MOVES LIKE THESE IT'S
GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN 10% OF
NEW YORKERS TO STOP JIMMY FROM
HIS STOLL LEM COMMITMENT TO
BEING A COMPLETE TOOL FOR
JUSTICE.
>> GET THAT CAMERA OUT OF MY
FACE!
>> GET YOUR FACE OUT OF MY
CAMERA!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE THE
LAW!
WAAH.
I AM JIMMY JUSTICE!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, JIMMY.
YOU, SIR, ARE TRULY AN N.Y.P.D.
