OLYMPICS ARE JUST ONE DAY AWAY,WHICH, OF COURSE, IS THE SILVER
MEDAL OF THEM STARTING TODAY.
IN THE RUN-UP TO THESE GAMES,VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS GOTTEN A LOT
OF CRITICISM FOR ANTIGAY LAWS,FOR BULL DOZING POOR
NEIGHBORHOODS TO BUILD OLYMPICFACILITIES AND NOW HARSHEST OF
ALL FOR HIS YOGURT BLOCKADE.

CHOBANI YOGURT.
CHUCK SCHUMER SAID IT'S STRANDEDAT NEW YORK'S AIRPORT.
>> Stephen:  OUR ATHLETES'YOGURT IS BEING EMBARGOED BUT
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE RUSSIANSWANT TO PROTECT TRADITIONAL
FAMILY VALUES.

OF COURSE, EVERYBODY KNOWS,EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I HAVE
OWNED THE WINTER OLYMPICS EVERSINCE I SAVED VANCOUVER IN 2010
