PEOPLE GOING FIVE, FOUR, SOME
TWO, THREE, SOME FOUR, FOUR.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION EVER SINCE WE TOOK OUT
OSAMA BIN LADEN AMERICANS HAVE
BEEN WONDERING WHO WAS GOING TO
FILL HIS SHOES.
ALL WE KNEW FOR SURE WAS THAT
AFTER DISCOVERING HIS
PORNSTACHE, NO ONE WAS GOING TO
TOUCH HIS SOCKS.

[LAUGHTER]
NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
MENTIONED AS POTENTIAL REPLACEMENTS FOR
STARTING WITH ASHTON CIEWCH
KUTCHER.
HE'S THE CHOICE FOR REIMMEDIATE
CONSIDERATION MAD MEN.
LA OF LAUGH LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY
HAVE FOUND THEIR MAN.
>> WANT TO BRING YOU THE LATEST
ON PERHAPS A REPLACEMENT FOR
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
A SOURCE HAS SAID THAT THEY'VE
PICKED BIN LADEN'S TEMPORARY
REPLACEMENT, AN EGYPTIAN AND
FORMER SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
SAID TO BE IN HIS 50s.
>> Stephen: EVIDENTLY HE
NAILED THE INTERVIEW.
WHEN ASKED WHERE HE SEES HIMSELF
IN FIVE YEARS HE SAID SLIDING
OFF A BOARD INTO THE OCEAN.
FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS -- THIS CHOICE RIGHT HERE

HE WAS SECOND IN THE COMMAND.
HE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE
PROMOTION.
ALL THE LAT LATE NIGHT SHIFTS
WORKING IN THE CAVES, BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL, BURNING THE
MIDNIGHT HOSTAGES ONLY TO BE
PASSED OVER FOR A TEMP WHO
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A BEARD.
WHAT IS NEXT CASUAL FRIDAYS
WHERE EVERYONE COMES IN WEARING
DENIM SUICIDE VESTS?
