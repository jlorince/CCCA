(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, BEFORE THE BREAK I
SHOWED OUR FIRST TWO
SUPERPAC ADS.
NOW I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE
ABOUT ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> CONTROVERSY SEEMS TO
FOLLOW ME WREFER I SEEK IT
BECAUSE WHILE THESE ADS
APPEARED ON TWO STATIONS IN
DES MOINES IT WAS ORIGINALLY
SUPPOSED TO AIR ON THREE.
BUT ONE OUR BEFORE THE FIRST
AD WAS TO AIR LAST NIGHT I
RECEIVED THIS ACTUAL E-MAIL
FROM WOI DES MOINES'S NEWS
LEADER, QUOTE, OUR GENERAL
MANAGER HAS REVIEWED BOTH OF
THE SPOTS THAT YOUR GROUP
WANTS TO RUN TONIGHT AND
TOMORROW AND WE ARE GOING TO
DECLINE TO AIR THEM.
>> OOOOHH!
>> Stephen: OOHH INDEED.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THE MIDWESTERN MEDIA
ELITE ARE TRYING TO SILENCE
US.
THEY DON'T WANT YOUR VOICE
TO BE HEARD, FOLKS.
THE FAT CASSES IN DES MOINES
THINK THEY CAN SIT IN THEIR
IVORY CORN SIGH LOWS AND
PLAY PUPPET MASTER WITH OUR
NATIONAL POLITICS.
AND GUESS WHAT WE'RE NOT
INVITED.
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT?
>> NO!
>> Stephen: GOOD BECAUSE I
WAS AFRAID YOU WERE GOING TO
TAKE IT AND I DON'T WANT TO.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST LISTEN WHY THEY WANT TO
SILENCE US.
THEY SAY THE ADS QUOTE ARE
CONFUSING TO VOTERS AS WE
GET CLOSER TO THE STRAW POLL
ON SATURDAY AND THE DEBATE
ON THURSDAY.
>> CONFUSING TO IOWA VOTERS?
REALLY?
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
[BLEEP] OVER-- DIP [BLEEP]
OVER IN NEBRASKA THIS IS
IOWA.
(APPLAUSE)
AND UNLIKE-- EXCUSE ME, CUS
ME.
BUT UNLIKE WOI, I BELIEVE
THAT IOWA VOTERS CAN
UNDERSTAND EVEN A COMPLEX
MESSAGE LIKE GO TO THE AM
ERCKS STRAW POLL, WRITE IN
PERRY, SPELL IT WITH AN "A"
OR DID I LOSE YOU WOI?
SHOULD I HAVE THE BOYS FROM
WHO NEWS CHANNEL 13 EXPLAIN
IT TO YOU?
AND LISTEN TO HOW THEY END.
>> PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU
HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS.
>> YEAH, JUST ONE MORE.
WHAT THE [BLEEP]?
WITH AN "A"
I'M MAD!
(APPLAUSE)
I AM HOPPING MAD.
BUT OF COURSE I AM NOT MAD
AT THE NEWS TEAM.
AMANDA, AND RACHEL,
TOP-NOTCH.
OF COURSE JOHN WALTERS
GIVING YOU THE LATEST ON
SPORTS AND BRAD EDWARDS
MANNING THE WEATHER CENTER,
NO.
I'M TALKING ABOUT WOI
MANAGEMENT.
YOU HAD OUR AD FOR TWO DAYS,
GENTLEMEN.
HELL, YOU HAD MY MONIES FO
SIX DAYS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND ONE HOUR, ONE HOUR
BEFORE TAPING YOU SUDDENLY
SAID HEY, IT MIGHT BE TOO
CONFUSING FOR YOUR VIEWERS,
REALLY?
BOTH OF THEM?
I HAPPEN TO KNOW YOU HAVEN'T
WON A LOCAL EMMY IN TEN
YEARS.
WANT TO TOUCH MINE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE,
FOLKS.
YOU CLEARLY SAVED A PHONE
CALL ORDERING YOU TO SHUT
COLBERT DOWN FROM ONE OF THE
OTHER SIX SHADOWY SUPERPACS
THAT ARE TRYING TO MUSS NELL
ON OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE AS THE
OFFICIAL UNCONNECTED PRO
PERRY SUPERPAC.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU
NORMALLY DEAL WITH, BUT
WOI-ABC 5, YOU ARE [BLEEP]
WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT?
YOU HEAR THAT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, YOU CAN HEAR THAT NOW.
COLBERT SUPERPAC IS NOT SOME
SMALL POTATOES BUSINESS THAT
WILL JUST SIT THERE AND TAKE
IT WE'RE NOT CURLEY'S
FURNITURE ON ARMY POST ROAD
WHERE PRICES HAVE BEEN GREAT
SINCE 1948.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE GOING
TO SIT THERE AND JUST TAKE T
YOU CANNOT DO ANY BETTER
THAN CURLLY'S SELECTION OF
LEATHER RECLINERS.
COLBERT SUPERPAC IS 155,000
STRONG, BABY.
HEAR US ROAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BESIDES-- BESIDES, YOU SAY
MY AD WAS CONFUSING.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND
CONFUSING, YOU WOULDN'T TAKE
OUR MONEY TO RUN OUR AD
DURING A 5:00 NEWS
COMMERCIAL BREAK BUT ON THE
10:00 NEWS YOU REPORTED ON
IT FOR FREE.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT HAS
PURCHASED AD SPACE IN IOWA
TO PROMOTE A WRITE-IN
CAMPAIGN FOR PERRY.
BUT SPELLED WITH AN "A"
INSTEAD OF AN "E"
>> A STORM IS GATHERING OVER
IOWA.
>> COLBERT WON APPROVAL FROM
THE FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMITTEE TO SET UP A
SUPERPAC IN HIS NAME.
WHICH MEANS CAN RAISE
UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF MONEY
AND FUNNEL IT INTO CAMPAIGN
ADS.
>> Stephen: THANKS, AMANDA,
GREAT REPORT.
NOW OVER TO BRAD WITH THE
WEATHER-- NO, WAIT!
STAY MAD!
CLEARLY SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
CORRUPTION.
SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE.
LIKE THE INTREPID WOI
REPORTER KATIE EASTMAN WHO
HAS THE COURAGE TO TACKLE
THE TOUGH ISSUES.
>> JESS CA, IT IS THE
LONGEST ANNUAL GARAGE SALE
IN IOWA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: .
>> Stephen: KATIE BLEW THE
LID OFF GARAGE SALE GAIT.
CLEARLY, CLEARLY, KATIE, YOU
ARE THE ONLY ONE I CAN
