THANK YOU.
NATION, I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT
THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS.
THEY ONLY HAPPEN ONCE EVERY TWO
YEARS, LIKE CHRISTMAS.
[LAUGHTER]
SO IT'S TIME FOR PART TWO OF MY
LONG-RUNNING SERIES, "STEPHEN
COLBERT'S 2010 MID-TERM
REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY
BATTLE WATCH '10."
NOW, LAST TIME YOU MAY REMEMBER,
I FOCUSED ON TENNESSEE.
TONIGHT I SWITCH OUR FOCUS TO
TENNESSEE.
WHERE THE LEADING CANDIDATE IN
THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR RON RAMSEY.
BUT RAMSEY HAS SOME TOUGH
COMPETITION IN REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN ZACH WAMP.
[LAUGHTER]
WHO HAS POWERFUL NAME
RECOGNITION FOR ALL THE TIME
IT'S BEEN USED AS A SOUND EFFECT
IN A DON MARTIN CARTOON.
[APPLAUSE]
NOW, RECENTLY CONGRESSMAN WAMP
ENCOURAGED VOTER TURNOUT WHEN HE
TOLD THE NATIONAL JOURNAL, "I
HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WILL GO TO THE BALLOT BOX IN
2010 AND 2012 SO THAT STATES ARE
NOT FORCED TO CONSIDER
SEPARATION FROM THIS
GOVERNMENT."
THAT'S PATRIOTISM.
UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED, GO
[BLEEPED] YOURSELF.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S IT.
OH, OH... BUT, FOLKS, WHEN IT
COMES DOWN TO IT, FOR GOVERNOR
OF TENNESSEE, I DON'T SEE
ANYBODY BETTER THAN THE MAN I
INTRODUCED YOU TO LAST WEEK.
>> HELLO, CITIZENS, I'M RUNNING
FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF
TENNESSEE.
I'M HERE TODAY NEXT TO THIS 286L
AIRCRAFT.
I PICKED THIS LOCATION BECAUSE I
LIKE IT A LOT.
[LAUGHTER]
I COULD STAY HERE FOREVER.
>> Stephen: YES, HE HOPES IT
STAYS THERE FOREVER.
PARTLY BECAUSE THAT PLANE IS A
SYMBOL OF AMERICA'S MILITARY
MIGHT AND POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE
SLEEPS UNDER IT.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, AS MUCH AS I ADMIRE HIS
PRO-LIKING THIS AIRPLANE A LOT
AGENDA, WHAT SOLD ME REALLY WAS
HIS POSITION ON THE SETTLEMENT.
>> I HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT OUR
FOREFATHERS, HOW THEY WROTE THE
CONSTITUTION.
THEY KNEW WE HAD MURDERERS ON
THE STREET.
THEY KNOW WE HAD NUT CASES.
BUT THEY DIDN'T PUT NO
SUBPARAGRAPHS IN THERE
CONCERNING THEM, SO WHO AM I TO
SAY, I'M GOING TO WRITE AN
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION
AND SAY, NUT CASES CAN'T HAVE
GUNS?
[LAUGHTER]
>> ON BEHALF OF ALL THE HEAVILY
ARMED MENTALLY ILL, I THANK YOU,
SIR, AND FOR USING THE MORE
SENSITIVE POLITICALLY CORRECT
TERM, "NUT CASE."
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, ARMING THE INSANE, FOR
TENNESSEE THAT'S JUST PLAYING TO
YOUR FAITH, BUT
BASILMARCEAUX.COM TAKES IT ONE
STEP FURTHER.
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RECALL
ALL LICENSES, ALL PERMITS AND
ALLOW EVERYONE IN THE STATE TO
HAVE A GUN, AND IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ONE, MAYBE I'LL EVEN FINE
YOU $10 FOR NOT HAVING ONE
BECAUSE I WANT YOU ALL IN A
GROUP OF 25 OR MORE TO COME TO
NASHVILLE WITH YOUR GUNS AND
TELL ME I'M DOING WRONG.
>> Stephen: NOW, THERE ARE A
LOT OF COMPLEX POLICY DETAILS IN
THERE, BUT I THINK THE MAIN
TAKEAWAY IS THIS: IT WILL TAKE
NOTHING LESS THAN 25 ARMED MEN
TO BRING DOWN BASIL MARCEAUX.
AND BASILMARCEAUX.COM IS NOT
BEHOLDEN TO ANY CORPORATE
INTEREST.
AS HE RECENTLY STATED IN FRONT
OF HIS BEST FRIEND, A CHOO CHOO
TRAIN.
>> I NEVER TOOK ONE, ANY, FROM
ANYONE.
I RATHER LOSE.
THAN TAKE MONEY.
I BELIEVE I HAVE TO OWE SOMEONE
IF I EVEN SHAKE THEIR HAND.
THEY LOOK FOR SOMETHING.
IF I WON, THEY'D PROBABLY WANT
TO COME OVER AND MAKE ME GIVE
THEM SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: BASILMARCEAUX.COM
PROMISES NOT TO PERFORM DENTAL
ON YOU, THOUGH...
[APPLAUSE]
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THIS
GUY COULD HOOK YOU UP WITH TANK
OF NITROUS.
TENNESSEE, COLBERT NATION, VOTE
FOR BASILMARCEAUX.COM, AND DON'T
WORRY IF YOU'RE NOT A REPUBLICAN
BECAUSE TENNESSEE HAS WHAT'S
CALLED AN OPEN PRIMARY.
WHICH MEANS THAT DEMOCRATS CAN
ALSO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY, POSSIBLY A FEW TIMES.
JUDGING BY BASIL, THE ROOM
SEEMED PRETTY RELAXED THERE.
SO ALL MY TENNESSEE VIEWERS, THE
PRIMARY IS THURSDAY.
GET OUT THERE AND VOTE.
TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE
BASILMARCEAUX.COM
