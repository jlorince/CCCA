HERE TO TELL ME OTHER WAYS WE
MIGHT SAVE OUR CREDIT RATING,
PLEASE WELCOME NEW YORK TIMES
WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, DAVID
LEONHARDT.
DAVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DOES IT REALLY MATTER IF WE HAVE
A TRIPLE A RATING?
CAN'T WE LET THE CHINESE KIDS
GET THE GOOD GRADES AND WE'RE
COPY OFF THEIR FINANCIAL REPORT?
>> IT PROBABLY MATTERS.
>> Stephen: WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
>> NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF RATING
BUT BECAUSE THE RATING REFLECTS
A REALITY.
WE HAVE A SERIOUS DEFICIT.
>> Stephen: HE WE JUST MADE
THE HARD CUTS.
>> WE DIDN'T MAKE THE HARD CUTS.
>> Stephen: WE MADE THE HARD
CHOICE TO MAKE THE HARD CUTS
LATER.
WE DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT.
THAT IS A SMALL PART ABOUT THE
BUDGET.
THEY ARE NOT ABOUT MEDICARE
WHICH IS BY FAR THE DOMINANT
SOURCE OF THE DEFICIT.
THEY ARE NOT ABOUT NEW TAX
REVENUE WHICH IS ONE WAY TO DEAL
WIT.
>>
TAXES ARE JOB KILLERS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE
TPHO *RBGT?
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY
ARE JOB KILLERS.
WE WERE HERD THAT WHEN BILL
CLINTON RAISED TAXES.
THE 1990'S TURNED OUT TO BE AN
OKAY DECADE.
>> Stephen: COULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER IF THERE WEREN'T RAISED
TAXES.
>> WE DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: LET'S TRY NOT
RAISING TAXES AND SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
>> UNLESS WE MAKE BIG CUTS TO
MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY WE
GET DOWNGRADED?
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY WAY
TO AVOID GETTING DOWNGRADED.
MOODIES REAFFIRMED THE AAA
RATING BUT SAID WE HAD A
NEGATIVE OUTLOOK.
>> THE RATING AGENCIES WANTED TO
SEE D.L. 4 TRILLION IN CUTS.
>> Stephen: WE DID $1zV
TRILLION.
HOW MUCH LESS IS THAT THAN FOUR?
>> THREE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A FAIR
AMOUNT.
>> YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE OTHER
COUNTRIES FACED WITH WITH THIS
CRISIS DOING RIGHT NOW?
WHO HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED?
>> MOST OF THE RICH WORLD IF NOT
ALL OF THE RICH WORLD WHICH
WOULD WE US, EUROPE AND JAPAN IS
DEALING WITH SOME VERSION OF
THIS.
WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION.
FAST GROWING HEALTH CARE COSTS.
THEY HAVE MUCH LOWER HEALTH CARE
COSTS THAN WE DO.
WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS
PROBLEM.
WE HAVE STRENGTHS THOSE OTHER
COUNTRIES DON'T.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE WEAPONS OF
WAR.
>> WEAPONS OF WAR.
>> Stephen: IF ANYBODY COMES
TO OUR MONEY WE'LL DROP ANOTHER
AAA ON THEM.
>> WE'RE THE COUNTRY EVERYBODY
WANTS TO MOVE TO.
IF OUR POLITIC SYSTEM CONTINUES
TO BE THIS PARALYZE AND
DYSFUNCTIONAL THERE'S REAL
REASON TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER
WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: DID THE TEA
PARTYERS WIN THIS ONE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DID THEY REACH THE
GOAL OF THROWING THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT INTO BOSTON
HARBOR.
>> THEY DIDN'T REACH THE
ULTIMATE GOAL BUT THEY WON THIS
ROUND.
THE BIG ISSUE NOW IS THERE'S NO
WAY WE SOLVE OUR DEFICIT WITHOUT
BRINGING DOWN HEALTH COSTS,
DEALING WITH SOCIAL SECURITY AND
PROBABLY RAISING TAXES UNLESS
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE RADICAL CUTS
TO THE FIRST TWO.
THIS DOESN'T DOESN'T DO ANY OF
THAT.
>> Stephen: DOES THE
SUPERCONGRESS FIX ANY OF THAT?
INSTEAD OF 535 PEOPLE TRYING TO
COME TO AN AGREEMENT IT'S 12
PEOPLE IN A CLOSED ROOM,.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: COMING UP WITH AN
AGREEMENT.
WITH THAT HELP?
>> SOMETIMES CLOSED ROOMS WORK
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO
ALL KINDS OF SCREAMING AND
SHOUTING IN PUBLIC.
MOST OF TIME THEY DON'T.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT A
SUPERDUPER CONGRESS WITH SIX
PEOPLE WITH AN UBERCONGRESS
ABOVE THEM AND THEN FINALLY JUST
HARRY REID AND McCONNELL WITH
KNIVES.
>> UNLESS TIGY ARE GOING TO CUT
MEDICARE, CUT SOCIAL SECURITY OR
RAISE TAXES NONE OF IT WILL
WORK.
>> Stephen: WILL YOU PLEASE
COME BACK IF THE UNITED STATES
CONTINUES TO EXIST?
>> I WILL.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
