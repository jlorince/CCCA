(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW CBS KNEW DAVIES HAD LIED TO
HIS EMPLOYER BUT BELIEVED THEHEROIC VERSION HE TOLD THEM
BECAUSE THEIR SOURCES LED THEMTO BELIEVE THAT DAVIES' F.B.I.
REPORT WAS IN SYNC WITH WHAT HETOLD "60 MINUTES."
OR HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD THE F.B.I.
THAT HE WAS THE LEAD SINGER OF'N SYNC.
IT'S NOT CLEAR.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE LATER THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" CHECKED WITH THE F.B.I.
AND DAVIES' F.B.I. TESTIMONY ISNOT WHAT HE TOLD "60 MINUTES."
SO CBS NEWS QUICKLY CHECKED ITSOWN F.B.I. SOURCES AND LEARNED
WHAT MR. DAVIES TOLD THE F.B.I.
DIFFERD FROM WHAT HE TOLD US.
SO CBS FACT CHECKED THE STORYBUT WHEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE
WRONG THEY FACT CHECKED IT FORREALS, Y'ALL!
(LAUGHTER)AND ON LAST NIGHT THE "60
MINUTES," LARA LOGAN ADDRESSEDTHE CONTROVERSY HEAD ON AT THE
VERY TOP OF THE LAST MINUTE OFTHE SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> WE END OUR BROADCAST TONIGHT
WITH A CORRECTION ON A STORY WEREPORTED OCTOBER 27.
WE REALIZED WE HAD BEEN MISLEDAND IT WAS A MISTAKE TO INCLUDE
HIM IN OUR REPORT.
FOR THAT, WE ARE VERY SORRY.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TOEVERY PERSON AT "60 MINUTES" IS
THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS WEMADE A MISTAKE.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I'M NOTBUYING THIS.
CBS IS GOOD AT JOURNALISM.
THERE'S ONLY ONE LOGICALEXPLANATION FOR WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED HERE.
HILLARY CLINTON GOT TO THEM!
(LAUGHTER)YOU SEE, FOLKS, AS YOU WELL KNOW
BUT I WILL REPEAT AS OFTEN ASPOSSIBLE, HILLARY CLINTON WAS
SECRETARY OF STATE DURING THEBENGHAZI ATTACKS!
I MEAN, THAT'S HER OFFICIALPHOTO.
(LAUGHTER)ERGO, QUID PRO QUO, AM BUS
BRIEF, SHE IS TO BLAME.
AND NOW N.O.W. SHE'S SO HUNGRYFOR POWER IN 2016 THAT SHE'S
SOMEHOW CONVINCED "60 MINUTES"TO AIR THIS FALSE BENGHAZI
APOLOGY TO DISCREDIT THEIRINVESTIGATION!
AND WE HERE AT THE "THE COLBERTREPORT" HAVE NOW FOUND AN
EYEWITNESS WITH STARTLING NEWDETAILS CONCERNING THE NIGHT OF
THE TRAGIC CBS/BENGHAZI APOLOGY.
JIM?
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE A COLLEGEINTERN AT "60 MINUTES."
(LAUGHTER)>> YES.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: AND FOR YOUR OWN
SAFETY, ARE YOU USING AN ALIASTONIGHT?
WHAT IS THAT?
>> PONCHO DENEWS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: NOW, PONCHO, YOUWERE INTERNING THE NIGHT ALL
HELL BROKE LOOSE AT "60MINUTES."
>> YES, STEPHEN, I WASDEFINITELY THERE THAT NIGHT
BECAUSE I'M AN ACTUAL HUMANWITNESS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: TELL US WHATHAPPENED, PANCHO.
>> WELL, I WAS COMING BACK FROMGETTING CHEWING TOBACCO FOR FOR
LESLEY STAHL WHEN I HEARDEXPLOSIONS OF SHOUTING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DONEXT?
>> I RAN TOWARDS IT.
I SCALED THE 30-FOOT WALLSURROUNDING THE NEWSROOM.
(LAUGHTER)ONCE I LANDED, A SHADOWY FIGURE
RAN TOWARDS ME SO I KNOCKED HIMOUT WITH THE BUTT OF MY HARPOON
GUN.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: WHO WAS THAT?
>> TURNS OUT IT WAS MORLEYSAFER.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THEN I TURNED AROUND AND I
SAW -- AND I SAW -->> Stephen: WHO DID YOU SEE?
>> IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON.
(LAUGHTER)SHE WAS SWINGING A BIKE CHAIN
AND YELLING "WE'RE HERE TO KILLTHE STORY!
WHO WANTS TO EAT SOME CHAIN?"(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)THEN SHE PISTOL WHIPPED MORLEY
SAFER.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH WAS CRUEL SINCE HE WAS
ALREADY UNCONSCIOUS.
>> Stephen: SO IT WAS HILLARYCLINTON WHO MADE CBS APOLOGIZE?
>> YES!
>> Stephen: I KNEW IT!
ANYTHING ELSE?
>> YEAH, STEPHEN, I HAVE ONEMORE EXCLUSIVE.
I'M NOT REALLY "60 MINUTES"INTERN PONCHO DENEWS.
I'M CHARLIE SKINNER OF ATLANTISCABLE NEWS CHANNEL AS PROFILED
IN THE HBO DOCUMENTARY "THENEWS."
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHAT?
WHERE DID THAT COLLEGE INTERNGO?
>> THERE WAS NEVER ANY INTERN,STEPHEN!
I DID IT TO PROVE A POINT THATAS JOURNALISTS WE ARE THE
GATEKEEPERS OF TRUTH!
WE SEPARATE RIGHT FROM WRONG;FACT FROM FICTION, DELICATE FROM
PERMANENT PRESS!
I RECALL A MAN WHO SAID WITHGREAT POWER COMES GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY.
THAT MAN WAS SPIDER-MAN'S UNCLE.
(LAUGHTER)AND NOW HE'S DEAD!
THE PUBLIC NEEDS US TO BE THEWATCHDOGS OF DEMOCRACY.
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TOCRITICIZE OUR LEADERS WITHOUT A
PROEFP, REPORT NATIONAL SECRETSWITHOUT FEAR OF IMPRISONMENT.
IF WE VIOLATE THIS CONTACT, THISPUBLIC TRUST --
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH LONGER?
>> ALMOST DONE.
THEN WE WILL HAVE A PUPPET PRESSOFS HERE, INNUENDO, HYPERBOLE
AND NONSENSE.
DING-DONG, WHO IS IT?
IT'S DOMINOES!
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THETHROAT!
DELIVERED HOT AND CRUSTY OR YOURMONEY BACK!
THAT'S THE GUARANTEE WE MAKEAMERICA EVERY NIGHT OTHERWISE
THE WORLD IS JUST CRAZY BREAD.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: TECHNICALLY, CRAZY
BRETT IS LITTLE CESARS.
>> IT'S CALLED POETIC LICENSE,GODDAMNIT!
>> Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT, THENEWSROOM'S CHARLIE SKINNER.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.
WE END OUR THIS PART OF THE SHOWWITH A CORRECTION.
IN OUR REPORT TONIGHT, A MANNAMED PONCHO DENEWS CLAIMED HE
WAS A "60 MINUTES" INTERN AND WEBELIEVED HIM BECAUSE HE HAD AN
I.D. LANYARD.
(LAUGHTER)FOLLOWING THE REPORT, THE
"WASHINGTON POST", THE "NEW YORKTIMES," AND THE "TV GUIDE" ALL
REPORTED THAT HE WAS ACTUALLYTHE ACTOR SAM WATERSTON STAR OF
-- "THE PLASTIC DOME OF NORMAJEAN."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)LOOK IT UP.

WE CHECKED WITH OUR SOURCES ATIMDB AND IT TURNS OUT WE MADE A
MISTAKE.
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE USED HIM INOUR REPORT AND FOR THAT WE'RE
VERY SORRY.

COLBERT REPORT" IS THE TRUTH,AND THE TRUTH IS, IT'S SOMEBODY
