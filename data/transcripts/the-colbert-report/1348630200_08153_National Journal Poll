30,000 FEET.
THINK.
NOW, GIVEN THIS KIND OF BOLD VISION FROM MITT ROMNEY, I AM SHOCKED THAT THE LATEST "NATIONAL JOURNAL" POLL HAS
OBAMA LEADING ROMNEY BY SEVEN POINTS!
BUT FOLKS THERE IS NO REASON TO PANIC.
FOX NEWS WILL PANIC FOR YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK THESE POLLS IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES UNDERSTATE ROMNEY'S SUPPORT.
