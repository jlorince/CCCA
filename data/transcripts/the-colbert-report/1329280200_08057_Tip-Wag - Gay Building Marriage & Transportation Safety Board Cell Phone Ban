(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
PEOPLE... I'VE ALWAYS SAID
PEOPLE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULD
NOT THROW STONES.
ALSO, THEY SHOULD PUT SOME PANTS
ON.
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN
OF SEATTLE.
FOR ONE THING, THEY HAVE TOTALLY
RIPPED OFF NEW YORK'S IDEA OF
HAVING A STARBUCKS EVERYWHERE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I MUST ADMIT, I WAS ODDLY
MOVED BY THIS STORY.
>> A UNIQUE WEDDING IN SEATTLE
THIS AFTERNOON AS PEOPLE CAME
TOGETHER TO WITNESS THE UNION OF
A WOMAN AND A BUILDING.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE A BUILDING
OM DEMOLITION, A SEATTLE WOMANBUILDINGFR
MARRIED IT.
>> I'M DOING THIS TO SHOW THE
BUILDING HOW MUCH I LOVE IT, HOW
MUCH I LOVE COMMUNITY SPACE AND
HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
SAY?
WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH A
BUILDING, IF YOU LIKE IT, THEN
YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT A WING ON
IT.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NOW, WHO ARE WE... WHO ARE WE?
IT SOUND ODD, WHO ARE WE TO
JUDGE THIS WOMAN FOR WANTING TO
MARRY A BUILDING?
I MEAN, IN COLLEGE WE ALL
EXPERIMENTED WITH ARCHITECTURE.
I HAD A HUGE CRUSH ON OUR DORM
BATHROOM.
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THAT THING
WAS BUILT LIKE A BRICK (BLEEP)
HOUSE.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, I WAS READY TO SEND A
COUPLE WEDDING GIFTS, MAYBE
SILVERWARE OR A LENGTH OF COPPER
PIPE UNTIL I HEARD THIS.
>> I'M GETTING MARRIED ON
SUNDAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE A GAY WEDDING.
>> Stephen: THAT BUILDING IS A
LESBIAN!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF
MY FINKER TO GAY BUILDING
MARRIAGE!
DON'T TELL ME YOU CAN'T FIND ANY
GOOD MALE STRUCTURES IN SEATTLE!
COME ON!
LOOK AT THE SPACE NEEDLE!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT THING IS HUNG LIKE THE
CHRYSLER BUILDING.
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WOMAN ON
FEMALE BUILDING IS JUST A
SLIPPERY SLOPE TO MAN ON
DOGHOUSE.
(LAUGHTER)
NEXT UP ON T TO THE WAG, THERE'S
NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN GETTING
IN MY CAR AND MAKING PHONE
CALLS.
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT EVERYONE
EMBRACES AMERICA'S
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO TEAR
DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHILE TEXTING
YOUR BEST FRIEND LOU-DOG.
WHAT'S UP, LOU DOG?
THE DOG IS LOOSE!
RUFF RUFF!
THAT'S THE DOG, YOU DON'T WANT
TO LET HIM OFF THE CHAIN.
HE'S CRAZY!
LOU DOG!
(HOWLS)
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS WHY... I COULD GO ON ALL
NIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF
MY FINKER TO THOSE NERVOUS
NELLIES OVER AT THE NATIONAL
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD.
LISTEN TO THEIR LATEST ASSAULT
ON OUR FIBER OPTIC FREEDOM.
>> SAFETY EXPERTS ARE CALLING
FOR A NATIONWIDE BAN ON USING
CELL PHONES TO TALK AND TEXT
MESSAGE WHILE DRIVING.
AND NOW THE N.T.S.B. WANTS TO
TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER, BANNING
ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN THE
CAR.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES?
EVEN MY DASHBOARD BLENDER?
(LAUGHTER)
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE MY
FAMOUS CARGARITAS?
(LAUGHTER)
WORST OF ALL, THIS BAN WOULD
EVEN INCLUDES HANDS-FREE
DEVICES.
YOU'RE TELLING ME I LEARNED TO
DIAL WITH MY FEET FOR NOTHING?
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, COME ON!
(HOWLS)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I LOVE LOU-DOG.
FOLKS, THE ONLY SAVING GRACE IS
THAT THIS BAN ON CELL PHONE USE
IN CARS APPLIES EXCEPT DURING
EMERGENCIES!
SO IF YOU WANT TO KEEP TALKING
WHILE DRIVING, I AM PROUD TO
INTRO INTRODUCE MY NEW PATENTED
CELL PHONE CASE "STEPHEN
COLBERT'S HIVE TALKING" WHICH IS
A BEE'S NEST FILLED WITH
HUNDREDS OF ANGRY YELLOWJACKETS.
ALL YOU DO IS JUST GLUE YOUR
CELL PHONE TO IT, STICK YOUR
HAND INSIDE AND NOW YOU'LL NEVER
LOSE THE RIGHT TO CALL YOUR WIFE
AND SAY "HONEY, DO YOU WANT KNOW
PICK UP ANYTHING AT THE GROCERY?
OH, MY GOD, BEES IN MY MOUTH!
BEES IN MY MOUTH!"
PLUS IT FUNCTIONS AS A G.P.S.
AS LONG AS YOUR DESTINATION IS
THE NEAREST SOURCE OF POLLEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
