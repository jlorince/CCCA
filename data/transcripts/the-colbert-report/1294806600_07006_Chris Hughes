EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
CO-FOUNDER OF FACEBOOK WITH A
NEW SITE CALLED JUMO.COM.
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT STARTS
INVADING MY PRIVACY, TOO.
PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS HUGHES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MR. HUGHES.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW GET ALL THE
RIDICULOUS STUFF OUT OF THE WAY.
WHO ARE YOU IN "THE SOCIAL
NETWORK"?
ARE YOU PLAYED BY JUSTIN
TIMBERLAKE?
>> I AM NOT.
THERE IS AN ACTOR IN THE MOVIE
WHO SITS ON THE COUCH AND HANGS
OUT.
REALLY ACCURATE MOVIE.
>> DID YOU LEAVE BECAUSE THE
TWINS THREATENED YOUR LIFE?
>> NOT EXACTLY.
THEY'RE STILL AT IT, BUT...
>> Stephen: ARE THEY STILL
COMING FOR YOU?
>> THEY'RE STILL COMING FOR
FACEBOOK.
I LEFT BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA'S
MESSAGE INSPIRED ME LIKE A LOT
OVER PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I WAS FORTUNATE TO WORK FOR HIM
FOR A COUPLE YEARS.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A GA
JILLON DOLLARS OR A BRAZILON
DOLLARS.
IS THERE ANY WAY TO DESCRIBE HOW
MUCH... HOW ABOUT THIS, IF YOU
WERE STANDING ON A CLIFF
OVERLOOKING THE SEA AND YOU HAD
A PITCHFORK AND YOU WERE JUST
SHOVELING MONEY INTO THE
ONCOMING WAVES, HOW BIG WOULD
THE DENOMINATIONS HAVE TO BE
BEFORE YOU WERE DESTROYING MONEY
BEFORE IT WAS SPONTANEOUSLY BORN
ON THE OTHER END?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I DO NOT HAVE AN ANSWER.
>> Stephen: GET YOUR NUMBER
CRUNCHERS TO WORK ON THAT.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE OBAMA
CAMPAIGN.
AFTER HE GOT IN THERE, YOU GUYS
BUZZED OUT JUST WHEN THE TEA
PARTY KICKED IT UP?
>> USING TECHNOLOGY IN THE
GOVERNMENT IS REALLY DIFFERENT
THAN USING TECHNOLOGY IN A
CAMPAIGN.
THE CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT BUILDING
A BOTTOM-UP MOVEMENT.
USING TECHNOLOGY IN GOVERNMENT
IS FOR AN AGENDA.
>> Stephen: I'M GLAD THE GUY
GOT SHUT DOWN, BUT THE THING
THAT I WOULD HAVE USED IS YOU
HAVE LIKE 25 MILLION PERSON
E-MAIL LIST?
>> 13 MILLION PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A NEUTRON
BOMB E-MAIL LIST.
HOW COME THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE
PEOPLE JUST MARCHING IN THE
STREETS WITH CLUBS?
>> BECAUSE IT WASN'T JUST A
LIST.
IT WASN'T JUST PEOPLE WHO WERE
WAITING TO BE DIRECTED BY BARACK
OBAMA TO TELL THEM WHERE TO GO.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT A ZOMBIE
ARMY?
WONDERFUL.
SPEAKING OF DIRECTING PEOPLE TO
A CAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT, WHAT IS
JUMO?
IT'S NOT A MONEY-MAKING VENTURE,
IS IT?
>> JUMO IS DIFFERENT.
IT'S A NETWORK TO HELP PEOPLE DO
THREE KEY THINGS, FIND
NON-PROFITS AND NGOs THAT WILL
INSPIRE THEM TO GET INVOLVED,
FOLLOW THEM, KEEP UP TO DATE
WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND
FINALLY SUPPORT THEM.
SO IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM
ALL OF THE OTHER NON-PROFIT-LIKE
WEB SITES THAT ARE ON THE WEB
NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T FOCUS ON
JUST DONATING.
WE FOCUS ON HELPING PEOPLE FIND
THE CAUSES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO
THEM AND KEEPING UP WITH THEM
OVER THE LONG-TERM.
IF THEY WANT TO DONATE, GREAT.
>> IMAGINE I'M A PERP WHO CARES
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE, AND I GO ON
THE JUMO.
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME IN DO I SIGN
ON?
DO I HAVE TO BE A MEMBER?
WHAT DO I DO?
>> YOU CREATE A JUMO ACCOUNT
JUST BY USING YOUR FACEBOOK
ACCOUNT.
YOU IMMEDIATELY CONNECT TO A
NON-PROFIT.
SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
SOMETHING LIKE GLOBAL HEALTH,
YOU COULD CONNECT TO A GREAT
GROUP CALLED PARTNERS IN HEALTH
WHICH WORKS IN HAITI, RWANDA,
PERU.
FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
LEARN THE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE
THEY ARE SUPPORTING AND HELPING,
AND IF YOU'RE INSPIRED TO
CENTRAL TIER OR TO DONATE, THEN
EETCH HAVE ILY HOPEFULLY YOU'LL
DO THAT.
BUT IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT
DEVELOPING THAT RELATIONSHIP.
>> Stephen: WHY COULDN'T I
JUST FIND OUT AND CONNECT WITH
THOSE PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK?
WHY CAN'T I JUST GO ON AND
"LIKE" WOMEN'S ISSUES OR I LIKE,
YOU KNOW, HOMELESS PEOPLE?
WHY WOULDN'T I JUST DO THAT?
>> YOU DEFINITELY CAN DO THAT ON
FACEBOOK, AND PEOPLE DO FIND
CAUSES ON JERUSALEM, YOU AS
WELL, BUT WHEREAS FACEBOOK IS A
NETWORK DESIGNED TO HELP YOU
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AND THE ISSUES THAT ARE
IMPORTANT TO YOU, JUMO IS
TOTALLY FOCUSED ON HELPING YOU
ENGAGE IN THE WORLD IN A
MEANINGFUL WAY.
>> Stephen: FACEBOOK IS ABOUT
ME, ME, ME, AND JUMO IS ABOUT
YOU, YOU, YOU.
IT'S ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.
>> IT'S BETWEEN THE TWO.
ON JUMO WHAT WE FIND...
>> Stephen: I CAN FIND A
CHARITY THAT WILL HELP ME?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN DO
THAT, BUT YOU PROBABLY COULD.
I THINK THAT JUMO IS MUCH MORE
FOCUSED ON HELPING YOU FIND THE
NON-PROFITS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
MEANINGFUL TO YOU SO YOU CAN
CONNECT TO THEM IN A LASTING
WAY.
FACEBOOK WASN'T BUILT FOR
NON-PROFITS.
JUMO IS.
>> Stephen: IF I DO GO ON THE
JUMO AND I FIND THE CHARITY I
WANT TO WORK WITH AND I WANT TO
HELP OTHER PEOPLE, CAN I STILL
POST PHOTOS OF ME LOOKING COOL
WHILE I DO IT?
LIKE I'M HELPING A HOMELESS
PERSON BUT I'M DOING THIS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> NOT EXACTLY.
BUT THAT MAY BE SOMETHING...
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
CHRIS HUGHES.
