NEXT UP, SYRIA.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE
TO SAY THAT BARACK OBAMA HASSCREWED THIS THING UP.
(LAUGHTER)TURNS OUT I WAS WRONG.
GIVES ME A GREAT DEAL OFPLEASURE-- BUT IT SHOULDN'T.
BECAUSE THIS IS BREWING INTO ACLEAR DISASTER THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE DO NOT WANT.
>> IN THE SENATE, 29 ARE AGAINSTMILITARY ACTION WITH 24
SUPPORTING A STRIKE.
IN THE HOUSE, 238 MEMBERS AREDEFINITE NO OR LEANING NO WITH
ONLY 26 IN FAVOR.
>> Stephen: 6-10 AMERICANSOPPOSE THIS.
>> THE PUBLIC IS DEAD SETAGAINST THIS.
>> Stephen: CONGRESS KNOWSTHAT THE ONLY THING LESS POPULAR
THAN ATTACKING SYRIA ISCONGRESS.
(LAUGHTER)SO CLEARLY CONGRESS MUST APPROVE
AN ATTACK ON SYRIA!
TELL THEM WHY, T.V. MAN.
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS BUY-IN,RIGHT?
HE MAY NOT GET IT.
BUT IF HE DOES NOT GET BUY-IN ONTHIS, CAN YOU IMAGINE ANOTHER
PRESIDENT EVER GOING TO CONGRESSWITH THE SAME SORT OF REQUEST
FOR USE IN THE SAME SORT OFFORCE?
IT SETS A PRECEDENT FOR THEPRESIDENCY.
>> I THINK HE WILL GET HIS WAYON THIS OR THE PRESIDENCY WILL
WIN BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL -- THENEXT PRESIDENT WILL SAY "I'M NOT
GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT."
>> Stephen: YEAH, I MEAN THECONSTITUTION IS SUCH A HASSLE!
(LAUGHTER)I KNOW THEORETICALLY THERE ARE
CHECKS AND BALANCES AND STUFFBUT IF THE PRESIDENT ASKS FOR
WAR APPROVAL, CONGRESS HAS TOSAY YES EVERY TIME HE ASKS!
NO MATTER HOW THE AMERICANPEOPLE FEEL ABOUT IT OR ELSE THE
PRESIDENT WILL STOP ASKING ANDTHEN CONGRESS WILL NEVER HAVE A
CHANCE TO SAY NO, WHICH THEYMUST NEVER DO.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S LIKE IF YOUR TEENAGE SON
ASKS TO BORROW YOUR CAR.
IF YOU SAY NO THIS TIME, NEXTTIME HE'LL ATTACK SYRIA.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KIDS --
(LAUGHTER).
NOW FACED WITH THISCONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS OBAMA IS
GETTING DESPERATE.
YESTERDAY IN A ROSE GARDEN PRESSCONFERENCE HE TRIED TO DRAW
ATTENTION WITH HIS SYRIA PLANWITH ONE OF THOSE FLOPPY TUBE
MEN.
(LAUGHTER)THOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY, THAT GUY
HAS A FIRMER SPINE THAN JOHNKERRY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WHO THIS MORNING RALLIED SUPPORT
FOR THE PRESIDENT WITH THISSTIRRING BATTLE CRY.
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAR.
WE WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD BASHARAL-ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE IN A VERY
LIMITED, VERY TARGETED, VERYSHORT TERM EFFORT WITHOUT
ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FORSYRIA'S CIVIL WAR.
UNBELIEVABLY SMALL LIMITED KINDOF EFFORT.
>> Stephen: SO WATCH OUT,BASHAR AL-ASSAD!
AMERICA IS GOING TO BRING DOWNTHE UNBELIEVABLY SMALL HAMMER.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, TO BE CLEAR, TO BE CLEAR
WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO AFFECT THECOURSE OF THE NAIL.
(LAUGHTER)AND, FOLKS, AS BAD AS THEIR
SALES PITCH IS, THEIR TIMING ISWORSE.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CALENDARNOW BECAUSE WHILE THE PRESIDENT
TALKS ABOUT SYRIA AND THAT'S THENUMBER ONE THING ON HIS MIND,
AMERICANS HAVE THIS THING CALLEDTHEIR OWN LIFE.
FOR EXAMPLE, "MONDAY NIGHTFOOTBALL."
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: YES.
AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF VIOLENCEIN THE MIDDLE EAST!
THEY WANT VIOLENCE IN THEN.F.L.!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
