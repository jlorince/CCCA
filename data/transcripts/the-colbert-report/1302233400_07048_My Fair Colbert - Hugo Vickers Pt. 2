NATION, AS A PROUD MEMBER OF THE
TEA PARTY, I LOVE BRITISH
ROYALTY.
I CANNOT WAIT TO RECEIVE MY
INVITATION TO THE ROYAL WEDDING.
IT HASN'T ARRIVED YET BUT I'M
SURE IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER
FOR THE WIZARDING OWLS TO CROSS
THE ATLANTIC.
FOLKS, MY APPETITE FOR THESE
NUPTIALS HAS BEEN WETTED BY
ROMANTIC TARGETED MARKETING.
IN FACT, DUNKIN' DONUTS HAS
INTRODUCED AN OFFICIAL ROYAL
WEDDING DOUGHNUT AND SO
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE LIKE
DIAMONDS, DIABETES IS FOREVER.
[LAUGHTER]
WE AMERICANS CAN BE PART OF THIS
RICHES TO EVEN MORE RICHES FAIRY
TALE THANKS THANKS TO PRODUCED MARKETED
RIGHT AT US USING ACTUAL BRITISH
ACCENTS.
SIR JIM.
>> A BEAUTIFUL SIMULATED SALON
SAVE FEAR REPRESENTED THE --
SAPPHIRE REPRESENTED THE QUALITY
OF ORIGINALñr AND IS SURROUNDED BY
SIMULATED DIAMONDS.
TODAY IT CAN BE YOURS FOR JUST $
19.
>> Stephen: THAT KNOCKOFF OF
SIMULATED HIGH QUALITY FILLS ME
WITH THE SAME EXCITEMENT OF
LOOKING AT A MUCH BETTER RING.
DETAILS KEEP TRICKLING OUT.
HERE SAY JUICY TIDE ABOUT IT
THAT I -- TIB BIT THAT I HEARD.
I HEARD KATE MIDDLETON IS
SCHEDULED TO HAVE SIX HAIR
STYLIST FOR THE WEDDING AND
PRINCE WILLIAMS IS SCHEDULED TO
HAVE SIX HAIRS.
[LAUGHTER]
LIKE ALL GOOD JOURNALISTS, I'VE
BEEN PREPARING FOR MYSELF --
MYSELF FOR MY BRUSH WITH MON ASH
YCHY.
JIM?
I MET WITH HUGO VICARS,
HISTORIAN,ñrñr ROYAL BIOGRAPHERÑi AND
EXPERT ON HE HAD QUIT.
HE TAUGHT ME THE PROPER
ETIQUETTE FOR HIGH TEA.
I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS.
AND NOW PART TWO OF MY FAIR
COLBERT:  STEPHEN COLBERT'S
CROWN JEWELS.
BEFORE ATTENDING THE ROYAL
WEDDING I HAD TO LEARN PROPER
PROT PROTOCOL FOR MEETING THE
QUEEN.
>> YOU MEET THE QUEEN, SHE COMES
IN, SHAKE THE HAND, NECK BOW.
>> AS AROUND AMERICAN CITIZEN
COULD HAVE TO BOW.
I JUST SAY YOUR IMAGINE
INDUSTRY, WHAT UP?
>> NO YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT YOU
SHOULD BE SAYING NOTHING AT ALL.
>> WHEN I HUG HER.
>> YOU DON'T HUG HER.
>> I'M NOT SAYING IT'S
NECESSARILY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN?
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP IN
THE NEWSPAPER AS HAVING SOME
KIND OF A GOSH, FAUX PAS, DO
YOU?
>> I DO WANT TO END UP IN
NEWSPAPERS.
>> NOT FOR BEING RUDE TO THE
QUEEN.
>> THEY ARE NOT CALLED KNEWS,
ARE THEY?
YOU ARE THE QUEEN.
I'M ME.
HERE I COME.
READY.
>> HELLO.
NO, NO, DON'T DO THAT.
>> HI, HOW ARE YOU DOINçó'
>> LET HER GOOD.
>> YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.
WHAT IS DIFFERENT?
I GOTTA GO!
♪ ♪
[LAUGHTER]
>> I LOOK GREAT FOR A WOMAN YOUR
AGE.
>> EVERYTHING IS WRONG ABOUT
THAT.
AND SLIGHTLY RUDE ACTUALLY.
THIS IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN I
THOUGHT.
WHAT SAY BASIC I NEED TO KNOW.
>> OBVIOUSLY THE CHANCES ARE
THAT YOU ARE THERE BEFORE THE
QUEEN AND IF THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU HAPPEN TO BE SEATED, YOU
WOULD STAND UP.
>> WE NEED A QUEEN.
I'LL GET US A QUEEN.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS WILL BE THE QUEEN.
[LAUGHTER]
I'MÑiçó EXPECTING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> QUITE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW.
>> I KNOW, I'VE NEVER MET THE
QUEEN BEFORE.
IF AT ANY POINT SHE DEFLATES, IS
IT ALLOWABLE FOR THE COMMONER TO
REINFLATE THE QUEEN?
>> NO.
>> THIS ONE IS FRESH OUT OF THE
PACKAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THAT IS UNNECESSARY.
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND I PUT IN
EFFORT AND I COME UP WITH A WAY
TO TALK TO THE QUEEN AND NOTHING
SEEMS TO PLEASE YOU.
>> WE COULD FIND A HUMAN QUEEN
AND THAT WOULD BE FINE.
>> FORGET IT.
>> WE'LL TRY ONE MORE TIME.
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.
WE'LL GET THIS RIGHT.
>> HUGO, HUGO?
>> YES.
>> I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT.
>> GOOD.
SORRY I WASN'T READY.
I APOLOGIZE.
[LAUGHTER]
OH, I'M SORRY, YOU WERE THE
QUEEN THEN.
TRY IT AGAIN.
I WASN'T GETTING THE QUEEN VIBE.
GIVE ME MORE QUEEN.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M JUST NOT BUYINGçó IT.
LET'S TRY THIS.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW THE QUEEN.
I'LL SELL QUEEN, OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
GET UP.
GET UP.
[LAUGHTER]
>> ONE MORE TIME, OKAY?
OKAY, READY?
>> READY.
ALL RIGHT.
>> VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
HAVE YOU COME A LONG WAY TODAY?
>> 3,000 MILES.
>> IS THAT FROM THE UNITED
STATES?
>> YES.
>> HOW INTERESTING.
GOOD.
>> Stephen: NAILED IT!
NAILED IT!
WHOO!
[ APPLAUSE ]
WHEN WE RETURN, HUGO WILL FIND
ME A PROPER SUIT FOR THE ENGLISH
ROYAL WEDDING.
