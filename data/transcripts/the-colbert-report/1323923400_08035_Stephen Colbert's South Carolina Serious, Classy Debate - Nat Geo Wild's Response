EVERYBODY IN THE MEDIA,
EVERYBODY IN HERE TONIGHT IS
TALKING ABOUT IT.
THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT IT.
MY SOUTH CAROLINA SERIOUS,
CLASSY REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
EVER SINCE DONALD TRUMP DROPPED
OUT OF HIS OWN DEBATE LAST
NIGHT, THERE HAS BEEN A GIANT
EGO-SHAPED HOLE IN THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.
NOW, ORIGINALLY I PLANNED TO
HOLD MY DEBATE ON ANIMAL PLANET.
[LAUGHTER]
BAR NONE HOME TO THE CUTEST BABY
SLOTHS ON TV.
MAKES THE BABY SLOTHS ON
DISCOVERY CHANNEL LOOK LIKE
HOOKERS.
BUT, OF COURSE, I CANNOT FORGET
WHAT NATURAL FIT THIS DEBATE
WOULD BE FOR NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC, NAT GEO.
LAST MIGHT I TOLD EVERYBODY
INVOLVED, THE CANDIDATES, THE
NETWORKS, IF THEY WERE
INTERESTED, THEY SHOULD SEND ME
AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT SAYING,
"I'M IN."
NO CANTALOUPE, HONEYDEW ONLY,
NUMBER-ONE MOST REFRESHING
MELON.
WRAP IT IN PROSCIUTTO, PUT IT ON
A TOOTHPICK, THERE IS LITERALLY
NO LIMITS TO WHAT THIS MELON CAN
ACHIEVE.
WELL, FOLKS, LOOKIE WHAT ARRIVED
TODAY.
THEY HAVE IT.
BOOM.
THIS IS FROM NAT GEO WILD.
THE CARD SAYS, "I'M IN."
SO MARK YOUR CALENDARS, FOLKS.
I DON'T HAVE A DATE YET.
JUST GO AHEAD AND MARK THE WHOLE
YEAR.
THIS DEBATE IS GOING TO BE
TREMENDOUS.
NAT GEO WILD INDISPUTABLY THE
WILDEST OF THE NAT GEOs.
AMAZING.
IT'S TERRIFYING, IT'S NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC GONE WILD.
YOU THROW BEADS.
A RECESS MONKEY SHOWS YOU HER
TEETH.
NAT GEO WILD KNOWS THIS WILL BE
THE TOP-RATED DEBATE IN HISTORY.
SINCE IT'S NAT GEO, IT'S GOING
TO BE ALL ANIMALS.
MY CO-HOST, THE DOG WHISPERER,
THE NUMBER-ONE GUY WHO TALKS
QUIETLY TO DOGS.
RICK PERRY GOES OFF TOPIC, HE
GETS THE SHHTZ.
RON PAUL GOES WILD, FLIP HIM ON
HIS BACK, RUB
