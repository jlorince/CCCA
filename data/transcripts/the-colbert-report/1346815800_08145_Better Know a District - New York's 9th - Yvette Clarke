FOLKS, THIS CONVENTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN THE PRESIDENCY.
IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATING DEMOCRATS TO HOLD ON TO THE SENATE AND TRY TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE.
TO DO THAT, THEY'RE GONNA NEED STRONG CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES,
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE 67TH IN STALLMENT OF MY 434-PART SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT.
TONIGHT, NEW YORK'S NINTH, THE FIGHTING NINTH.
[CROWD CHEERING]
USED TO BE THE FIGHTING 11TH.
THIS IS THE SCENE FOR THE ATTLEOF LONG ISLAND AND THE BATTLEB CRY WHY DIDN'T WE ATTACK DURING
RUSH HOUR.
THIS DISTRICT IN BROOKLYN IS OWNED BY PROCESS PECK PARK ZOO WHERE YOU AND YOUR KIDS WITH SEE
IVER OTTERS AND CONTACT RUSER AND EVEN THE RARE SUNNY-D BOTTLE FULL OF CAB-DRIVER URINE.
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL HAS NOW KU78 TO THE DISTRICT WITH THE RECHRISTENED BROOKLYN NECESSARY
WHO ARE PARTLY OWNED BY RAP OR JAY-JEAVMENT.
THEY'VE GOT 99 PROBLEMS.
IT'S HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC.
IN FACT BARACK OBAMA WON 9 ON% OF ITS VOTES IN 2008.
HE'D HAVE GOTTEN ALL THE VOTES BUT 10% OF BROOKLYNITES VOTED FOR JOHN MCCAIN IRONICALLY.
[CROWD CHEERING]

BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, YOU'RE GOING BACK THERE.
>> OKAY.
I WOULD SAY TO THEM, SET ME FREE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen:  FROM.
I HEAR THERE WAS SLAVERY IN BROOKLYN IN 1898.
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE PART OF THE UNITED STATES.
SLAVERY GOING UNTIL 1898.

>> THE DUTCH.
>> Stephen:  THE DUTCH.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU SEE THE DUTCH ON --
>> EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen:  MOVING ON.
YOUR PARENTS WERE CARIBBEAN IMMIGRANTS, CORRECT.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> WHERE IN THE CRIB YEN WERE -- CARIBBEAN WERE YOUR PARENTS.
>> IN JAMAICA.
MY MOTHER GREW UP ON A FARM AND MY FATHER GREW UP IN THE CITY.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DID YOUR MOTHER'S FAMILY GROW ON THE FARM.
WAS THE GANJA.
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY OTHER CROP.
>> WHY DID YOU GET GANJA FROM.
>> Stephen:  I LISTEN TO A FAIR AMOUNT -- ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE INDUSTRY WANT TO HAVE A POOL
PARTY, AN UPRISING.
GREAT MUSIC.
GET UP STAND UP GET UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS.
THAT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS ON WALL STREET ARE TRYING TO DO.
>> DON'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT.
>> Stephen:  NO.
FIGHT.
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT MARLEY WAS TALKING ABOUT.
DO YOU WANT TO LET THE BUSH TAX CUTS EXPIRE.
>> I THINK THE BUSH TAX CUTS DEFINITELY NEED TO EXPIRE.
>> Stephen:  THAT WOULD PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON GUYS LIKE ME,
THE TOP 1% JOB CREATORS.
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CREATE JOBS ANYMORE IF WE'RE TAXED.
>> I KNOW.
SOMEONE AS INTELLIGENT AS YOU ARE CAN COME UP WITH THE REST.
>> Stephen:  TO HIDE MY MONEY SO IT WON'T BE TAXED.
>> YOU CAN DO THAT.
YOU CAN DO THAT BUT.
[APPLAUSE]
>> YOU'RE IN A POSITION, NO MATTER WHAT, TO HAVE TAXES BY THE GREATEST WORK FORCE IN THE WORLD.
>> Stephen:  WE'VE GOT GREAT WORKERS HERE BUT THEY DO THINGS
LIKE THEY UNIONIZE, THEY HAVE MINIMUM WAGE.
ALL THE THINGS THAT HELP DEPRESS JOB GROWTH HERE.
WHAT IF WE GOT RID OF UNIONS AND GOT RID OF THE MINIMUM WAGE.
IF WE LOWERED THE WAGES ENOUGH HERE, ALL THE JOBS WOULD COME BACK.
>> THAT REMINDS ME OF LIKE 18,
WAS IT 1896.
>> Stephen:  1898 BACK WHEN THERE WAS STILL SLAVERY IN BROOKLYN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen:  COME BACK TO THE TIME MACHINE FOR A SECOND.
YOU GOT IN THE TIME MACHINE AND YOU WENT BACK TO BROOKLYN IN 1898.
>> I WOULD SAY TO THEM, THIS PLACE IS A GREAT PLACE.
>> Stephen:  YOU WOULDN'T MENTION THE SPANISH INFLUENZA
THAT'S ABOUT TO KILL LIKE 17 MILLION PEOPLE OR THE WALL STREET CRASH OR THE TITANIC OR
EVEN ATTEMPTS TO KILL HITLER.
>> WELL, I MEAN I THINK THAT --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen:  YOU COULD STOP WORLD WAR II FROM HAPPENING, YOU WOULDN'T DO IT.
>> WOW, THAT'S HEAVY.
THAT'S HEAVY.
>> Stephen:  YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU GOT IN THE TIME MACHINE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK I WOULD HAVE TO, IN THAT CASE.
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THAT, BUT I MEAN WORLD WAR II IS ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFIC PERIODS.
>>> IT'SPERIODS.
>> Stephen:  IT'S UP THERE.
>> I WOULD TRY.
I WOULD TRY.
