[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, IF YOU READ THE NEWS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT
IS GOING ON IN AMERICA THERE'S NO DENYING THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN A FAILED PRESIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
AS TERRIBLE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN, HIS CABINET APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN WORSE.
I MEAN, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY RAY LAHOOD?
WHY?
BECAUSE HIS NAME'S GOT A CAR PART IN IT?
THAT'S A LOW STANDARD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT IS NEXT?
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY PENNY McNICKEL?
NOW HE WANTS THE NEW DEFENSE SECRETARY TO BE FORMER REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHUCK HAGEL.
THANKFULLY, TODAY 15 REPUBLICAN SENATORS DEMANDED THE WITHDRAWAL OF HAGEL'S NOMINATION AND IT'S
NO WONDER.
SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE FOUND ALL SORTS OF SHADY ASSOCIATIONS IN HAGEL'S PAST.
FOR INSTANCE, HE WAS ONCE A SENATE REPUBLICAN.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOW, ACCORDING TO CONSERVATIVE NEWS ANGER-GREGATOR BREITBART.COM, HAGEL MAY HAVE
TAKEN MONEY FROM AN ORGANIZATION CALLED "FRIENDS OF HAMAS." FRIENDS OF HAMAS!
THAT'S SERIOUS!
BEING FRIENDS WITH A MUSLIM TERRORIST IS A BIG COMMITMENT.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE A GROOMSMAN IN ALL FOUR OF THEIR WEDDINGS.
I MEAN, THE SUICIDE VEST RENTALS ALONE!
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, THIS BOMBSHELL LIT UP THE CONSERV-OSPHERE.
>> LET ME BRING UP ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT BEN SHAPIRO AT BREITBART PUT OUT TODAY, WHICH
IS ONE OF THE FOREIGN FUNDERS BEHIND SENATOR HAGEL THAT HE HAS NOT YET DISCLOSED FORMALLY IS
SOMETHING CALLED FRIENDS OF HAMAS.
>> YOU KNOW I SAW THAT INFORMATION TODAY, ALSO, AND THAT IS MORE AND MORE CONCERNING.
>> THERE WAS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK, NOT CONFIRMED YET.
BUT WE-- ALSO NOT DENYING IT VERY VIGOROUSLY THAT ONE OF THE GROUPS BEHIND THE SPEECHES MAY
HAVE BEEN AN OUTFIT CALLED FRIENDS OF HAMAS.
>> THAT HAS A RING TO IT.
ZINT?
>> Stephen: OH, IT HAS A RING TO IT.
A RING THAT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS: AND FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FRIENDS OF HAMAS IS EVEN WORSE THAN IT SOUNDS BECAUSE THIS ORGANIZATION IS SO SINISTER THAT
IT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TURNS OUT, HAGEL'S LINK WITH "FRIENDS OF HAMAS" GOES BACK TO DAILY NEWS REPORTER DAN FRIEDMAN
WHO ASKED A REPUBLICAN SENATE AIDE LOOKING FOR DIRT IN HAGEL'S PAST IF HAGEL HAD GIVEN A SPEECH
TO THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF HEZBOLLAH OR THE FRIENDS OF HAMAS.
ASSUMING THAT NO ONE COULD TAKE SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT ORGANIZATIONS WITH THOSE NAMES EXISTED.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY?
I MEAN, IF THERE'S NO JUNIOR LEAGUE OF HEZBOLLAH, WHO PUTS OUT THE COOKBOOK OF BOMB RECIPES?
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES, THE FACT THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS DON'T EXIST ONLY MAKES IT MORE SUSPICIOUS THAT
CHUCK HAGEL HAS BEEN TIED TO THEM.
WHAT ELSE IS HE HIDING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED?
IS HE A MEMBER OF THE AL QAEDA KIDZ CLUB?
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT ABOUT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD?
OR THE MUSLIM SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND WHAT ABOUT NON-ISLAMIC NON-EXISTENT GROUPS?
HAS CHUCK HAGEL EVER GIVEN A SPEECH TO COBRA?
OR FOR THAT MATTER COBRA KAI?
HAS HE RECEIVED DONATIONS FROM THE LOLLIPOP GUILD?
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT ARE HIS TIES TO THE DEAD POET'S SOCIETY?
AND WHY ARE THEY DEAD?
DID THEY KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT BENGHAZI?
[LAUGHTER]
PRESIDENT OBAMA, WITHDRAW HAGEL'S NOMINATION, OR YOU WILL LOSE THE SUPPORT OF MODERATE
REPUBLICANS, ANOTHER
