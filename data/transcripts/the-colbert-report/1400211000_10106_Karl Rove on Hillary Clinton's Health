COULD'VE SWORN MY TREADMILL WASA DECEPTICON
( CHEERS )NATION, THERE IS NOTHING THAT
GETS ME MORE EXCITED THAN A GOODPOLITICAL RIVALRY.  BUSH V. GORE
BUSH V. BORE.
BUSH V. DOOR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WELL, BUCKLE UP, FOLKS,
BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW POLITICALBATTLE ROYALE,
KARL VERSUS HILLARY. AND LASTWEEK KARL CAME OUT SWINGING
>> KARL ROVE SUGGESTED HILLARYCLINTON MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE.
>> TONIGHT, KARL ROVE SLAMMINGHILLARY CLINTON--
>> THE HEADLINE IN THE "NEW YORKPOST" SCREAMING, "KARL ROVE,
HILLARY MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE."
>> ROVE WAS TALKING ABOUTHILLARY'S TREATMENT AFTER SHE
SUFFERED A FALL AND CONCUSSIONIN 2012.
>> HE SAID THIS, "30 DAYS IN AHOSPITAL AND WHEN SHE REAPPEARS
SHE'S WEARING GLASSES FOR PEOPLEWITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S UP WITHTHAT."
>> Stephen:  YEAH, WHAT'S UPWITH THAT.
CONGRESS MUST CONVENE A SELECTCOMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE
WHATNESS OF THAT BEING UP?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )A LOT OF SELECT COMMITTEE FANS
HERE TONIGHT.
NATION, THIS IS A SERIOUSSCANDAL BECAUSE ROVE'S
CONJECTURE IS BASED ON SOLIDFACTS.
HILLARY CLINTON DID GO TO THEHOSPITAL AFTER A CONCUSSION IN
2012, AND SHE LATER EXHIBITEDSOME VERY STRANGE BEHAVIOR IN
HER BENGHAZI TESTIMONY.
SHE HAD A MASTERY OF THE FACTSAND AN UNSHAKABLE CONFIDENCE,
ALL WHILE WEARING THOSE STUPIDGLASSES.
I MEAN, THEY'RE, LIKE-- THESETHINGS ARE LIKE ORTHOPEDIC SHOES
FOR YOUR FACE.
YOU'D HAVE TO BE BRAIN DAMAGEDTO WEAR THOSE, OR NEARSIGHTED,
WHICH I BELIEVE IS CAUSED BYBRAIN DAMAGE.
( LAUGHTER )AND HILLARY'S SHOWN SIGNS OF
MENTAL FRAILTY BEFORE.
JUST LOOK AT THESE PANTS SHEWORE IN THE 1970s.
( LAUGHTER )GIRL, THAT IS IS A TRAUMATIC
FASHION INJURY.
OF COURSE, THE LIBERAL MEDIAATTACKED, SO ROVE WENT ON FOX
NEWS TO UN-POLOGIZE.
>> MY POINT WAS THAT HILLARYCLINTON WANTS TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT, BUT SHE WOULD NOT BEHUMAN IF THIS DIDN'T ENTER IN AS
A CONSIDERATION, IF-- IF-- AND--AND MY OTHER POINT IS THIS WILL
BE AN ISSUE IN THE 2016 RACE,WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT.
LOOK, SHE'LL BE 69 BY THE TIMEOF THE 2016 ELECTION.
SHE-- SHE WILL BE 77 IF SHESERVES TWO TERMS.
AND THIS ENDS UP BEING AN ISSUE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DOCTORSSAID ABOUT WHAT SHE HAS TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT.
SHE'S HIDDEN A LOT.
>> Stephen:  YES, SHE'S HIDDENA LOT.
WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER DISEASES WECOULD WONDER IF SHE HAS.
( LAUGHTER )SCURVY?
GINGIVITIS?
RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME?
COOPER'S DROOP?
COULD SHE HAVE POPCORN LUNG?
AND KARL'S ONLY BRINGING THIS UPBECAUSE THE MEDIA IS GOING TO
MAKE AN ISSUE OF IT ANYWAY.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HOW MUCHTHEY'VE BEEN
MAKING AN ISSUE OF IT SINCE KARLBROUGHT IT UP.
>> THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT KARLWANTS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT.
>> HE WANTED US TO STARTFOCUSING ON HILLARY'S HEALTH.
HE WANTS TO RAISE SUSPICION.
>> KARL ROVE HAS GOTTEN EXACTLYWHAT HE WANTS.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT ANDIT'S BEEN MAKING NEWS.
IT'S BEEN ON PROGRAMS NOW ONCABLE NEWS FOR THE PAST 10-24
HOURS.
>> IT WAS TOTALLY FABRICATED.
THEN HE PULLS IT BACK.
NOW WE'RE HAVING THIS WHOLESEGMENT ON IT.
( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  YEAH!
EVERYBODY IN THE NEWS IS TALKINGABOUT IT, EVEN-- EVEN THIS GUY
OVER HERE.
THAT GUY RIGHT THERE, WATCH,WATCH.
I BETTER HE STARTS TALKING ABOUTHILLARY'S BRAIN DAMAGE.
HE JUST DID IT!
HE JUST SAID IT!
MAYBE HE'LL SAY IT AGAIN.
( LAUGHTER )NAH.
NAH, HE'S JUST-- HE'S EATINGPOPCORN RIGHT NOW.
MAN.
THE MEDIA.
YOU GUYS ARE ( BLEEP ) UP.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I THINK I'VE GOT POPCORN LUNG.
ALL KARL ROVE IS SAYING IS THATHILLARY IS A PUBLIC FIGURE AND
WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT HERBRAIN.
FOLKS, THERE IS ANOTHER PUBLICFIGURE WHO WORRIES ME EVEN
MORE-- KARL ROVE.
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT HILLARYSPENT 30 DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL
WHEN IN FACT SHE WAS THERE FORONLY THREE DAYS.
HAS KARL ROVE LOST TRACK OF TIMEBECAUSE HE HAS A SERIOUS BRAIN
INJURY?
I'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION.
I MEAN, FOR SOME REASON, HE ISPROTECTING HIS SKULL WITH A
THICK CUSHION OF MEAT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE'S JUSTYANKING THESE STORIES ABOUT
HILLARY'S HEALTH RIGHT OUT OFHIS ASS, BUT BECAUSE HE WEARS
THOSE ORTHOPEDIC PANTS AT THISPOINT WE DON'T KNOW IF KARL ROVE
HAS AN ASS.
HE COULD SUFFER FROM A RARECONDITION WHERE THE LOWER
INTESTINAL TRACK IS REROUTED TOTHE CRANIAL CAVITY.
IT'S CALLED"COPROENCEPHALOPATHY" OR
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, ( BLEEP ) FORBRAINS.
WE DON'T KNOW.
IT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE.
I HAVE TO SAY, HIS MOUTHEXHIBITS ALL THE CLASSIC
SYMPTOMS.
I'M JUST ASKING, WHAT'S UP WITHTHAT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
