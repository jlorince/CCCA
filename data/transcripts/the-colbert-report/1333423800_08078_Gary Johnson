>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO AND AN ADVOCATE FOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: .
>> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME GARY JOHNSON.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NEVER HEARD MY AUDIENCE CHEER SO HARD FOR A FEDERAL O FENCE.
NOW YOU SEEM LIKE YOU ARE A BAD INFLUENCE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU.
>> I'VE BEEN ON THREE TIMES,
MAYBE YOU FORGOT BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD HEAD FOR FACE.
>> ARE YOU THE FORMER TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO.
ARE YOU SEEKING THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE RUNNING AS A REPUBLICAN.
>> TRUE.
>> TRUE.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS THE RIFT BETWEEN YOU AND THE REPUBLICANS THAT DROVE YOU
ALL THE WAY TO THE LIBERTARIAN.
>> WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY ALL THE WAY TO THE LIBERTARIANS.
I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THIS COUNTRY IS FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE AND SOCIALLY TOLERANT AND I THINK
THAT'S-- .
>> Stephen: I'M NOT SOCIALLY TOLERANT.
YOU HAVE THAT ONE WRONG.
>> MOST AMERICANS ARE SOCIALLY TOLERANT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT WMS I'M IN THAT CATEGORY.
>> Stephen: THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO AREN'T HIP TO THE SCENE, DESCRIBE
WHAT-- DESCRIBE WHAT A LIBERTARIAN IS.
>> A LIBERTARIAN IS GOING TO END THE WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE LIBERTARIAN-- .
>> Stephen: PRETTY MUCH ALREADY DONE ALREADY.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
DON'T GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR STUFF HE HASN'T DONE.
PROUD OF-- OUT OF IRAQ.
GETTING OUT OF AFGHANISTAN,
EVENTUALLY.
>> I THINK THAT IS THE KEY WORD, EVENTUALLY.
THE LIBERTARIAN IS GOING TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET.
THE LIBERTARIAN IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SCREAMED FOR POT.
(LAUGHTER) LET'S GET HIGH AND GET GAY MARRIED, THAT IS THE MESSAGE.
THAT IS YOUR MESSAGE.
THAT IS YOUR MESSAGE.
>> AND SO THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY NOW IS 40 AREAS OLD.
AND A POLL THREE MONTHS AGO,
50% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
WHO PERHAPS IS SIMILARLY MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT?
PERHAPS IT'S THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY WHICH INITIALLY COOKS,
TODAY NOT SO COOKY.
EVERYTHING THAT THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY IS TALKING ABOUT TODAY, I THINK IS NOT
KOOKY AT ALL T IS REALLY THE PRESCRIPTION FOR WHAT AILS AMERICA.
>> Stephen: IF THAT IS THE CASE, YOU RAN AS A REPUBLICAN, AGAIN YOU ARE A
TWO TERM GOVERNOR OF MEXICO.
>> NUEVO MEXICO.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY POTE POTE I SAY BURRITO.
>> WHY COULDN'T YOU GAIN TRACTION WITH THE REPUBLICANS?
I MEAN RON PAUL GOT TRACTION.
I MEAN A PIZZA MAGAZINENAT GOT TRACTION.
A FAT MAN WITH ORANGE SKIN GOT TRACTION.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET TRACTION?
>> YOU KNOW, I HATE TO GO DOWN A CUBBEE HOLE HERE BUT I WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE
DEBATES BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A CERTAIN SHOWING IN POLLS WHERE MY NAME DIDN'T
APPEAR IN THE POLL.
>> Stephen: SO YOU DIDN'T REGISTER 2% IN STAND IN POLLS BUT YOUR NAME WAS ALSO
NOT INCLUDED.
>> NOT INCLUDED.
THAT'S A TOUGH AUDIENCE.
>> THAT SI A TOUGH ONE TO CRACK.
I THINK MY MESSAGE IS THE SAME AS RON PAUL.
I DON'T THINK RON PAUL IS GOING TO GET THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS MESSAGE WHEN HE ENDS UP GETTING OUT OF THE RACE?
I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA.
I THINK REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT THIS COUNTRY IS FACING, FISCAL ISSUES,
BALANCING THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND THEN ON THE SOCIAL SIDE,
THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD AND ARE SOCIALLY TOLERANT.
>> Stephen: .
>> KEEP GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE BEDROOM.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
NOW ARE YOU PRESENTLY, ARE YOU PRESENTLY IN STRAW BOLLS LEADING ON THE LIBERTARIAN SIDE, CORRECT?
>> ACTUALLY, THERE POLLS RIGHT NOW I'M AT 7% AGAINST OBAMA AND ROMNEY BELIEVING
THAT ROMNEY WILL BE THE NOMINEE.
BUT THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IS THE POLL AT 15% AGAINST OBAMA AND ROMNEY AND POTENTIALLY BE ON THE
NATIONAL DEBATE STAGE IN MY OPINION TALKING ABOUT BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO OLD PARTIES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK WILL YOU GET THE NOMINATION AT THE LIBERTARIAN CONVENTION?
>> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.
BUT AS IT SITS RIGHT NOW, I JUST MIGHT BE THAT NOMINEE.
>> Stephen: WHERE IS THE CONVENTION.
>> LAS VEGAS, NEVADA.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
GO IF YOU ACTUALLY GET THE NOMINATION IN LAS VEGAS,
WILL THE NOMINATION STAY IN LAS VEGAS?
BECAUSE THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.
YOU WANT TO GET THE WORD OUT THERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU HIT ON IT WE WANT TO GET THE WORD OUT THERE.
WANT TO BE AT 15%.
RIGHT NOW, 82% OF AMERICANS ARE SAYING THEY WOULD CONSIDER VOTING FOR A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE.
I THINK THE THIRD PARTY IS THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY.
THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY ARE INDEPENDENTS.
SO WHO IS REPRESENTING THEM?
>> Stephen: WELL, GOVERNOR,
WHEN ARE YOU IN VEGAS, IF YOU HAVE TIME, REMEMBER THE WORDS OF JESUS, HOLD ON AND
16 AND SPLIT YOUR ATSS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON,
