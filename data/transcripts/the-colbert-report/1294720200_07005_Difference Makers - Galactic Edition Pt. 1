NATION, WHEN TRAGIC EVENTS
DOMINATE THE HEADLINES, AS A
NEWSMAN I HAVE TO ASK, CAN I RUN
A PRETAPED PIECE ABOUT SPACE
ALIENS?
WELL, AS ALWAYS, THE ANSWER IS
YES.
NOW, I HAVE LONG BEENçó AGAINST
ILLEGAL ALIEN, PARTLY BECAUSE
THEY DISTRACT US FROM AN EVEN
BIGGER THREAT, REAL ALIENS, OR
AS I CALL THEM, SPACE MEXICANS.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY BE COMING TO
EARTH IN THEIR FLYING SOMBREROS?
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT, FOLKS,
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT AFRAID OF
THE IMMINENT INVASION.
IN FACT, THEY'RE WELCOMING IT.
FORTUNATELY THERE ARE BRAVE
HEROES OUT THERE DRAWING A LINE
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
. WE HONOR ONE OF THESE
DIFFERENCE MAKERS.Ñi
OUTER SPACE.
EVER SINCE AMERICA DISCOVERED
IT, WE'VE WONDERED: IS ANYONE
OUT THERE.
SO FAR NO CONTACT, WHICH MAY BE
A GOOD THING ACCORDING TO
THEORETICAL PHYSICIST STEPHEN
HAWKING.
>> I THINK THE OUTCOME WOULD BE
MUCH AS WHEN CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS FIRST LANDED IN
AMERICA, WHICH DIDN'T TURN OUTçó
VERY WELL FOR NATIVE AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S JUST
THE OPINION OF THE PROFESSOR OF
PATHMATICS AT CAMBRIDGE
UNIVERSITY.
WHAT ABOUT DARRYL?
>> THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL
FOR HUMANS AT ALL.
IT NEVER HAS IN HISTORY AND IT
WON'T IN THE FUTURE DO, FUTURE,
FUTURE.
>> Stephen: THIS IS DARRYL
SIMS.
DARRYL HUNTS ALIENS.
>> I'M KNOWN AS THEçó ALIEN
HUNTER.
♪ ALIEN HUNTER
MAKING A DIFFERENCEçó ♪♪
>> Stephen: ALIEN HUNT HUNTING
IS A DEMANDING JOB, ONE THAT
CALLS FOR A VERY SPECIALIZED
SKILL SET.
>> I SPENT TWO YEARS ON COVERT
OPERATIONS.
I'M A REGISTERED HYPNOTIC AN
STEEZ THERAPIST.
AND I ALSOñr DO BOUNTY HUNTING.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: WITH 40 YEARS OF
EXPERIENCE, THE HUNTER WARNS
THAT LURING ALIENS DOWN TO EARTH
HAS TERRIFYING CONSEQUENCES.
>> IT WILL BE LIKE THE S.S.
KICKING IN YOUR DOOR, COMING IN
AND DOING WHATEVER THEY
CHOOSE... CHOOSE... CHOOSE
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
NAZIS FROM OUTER SPACE.
THIS IS SOMETHING DARRYL KNOWS
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.
HE'S BEEN ABDUCTED WE ALIENS
HIMSELF MULTIPLE TIMES
BEGINNING...
>> AT AGE FOUR, 1952, 1005 SOUTH
K STREET MIDLAND TEXAS.
I SAT UP IN MY BED AS I HEARD
SOMETHING IN MY ROOM.
I NOTICED A TALL, SPINDLY WHITE
CREATURE MOVING TOWARDS ME AND
ITS LARGE HEAD WITH LARGE BLACK
EYES PROVED VERY CLOSE TO MY
FACE.
AS HE DID, ALL OF A SUDDEN I
BECAME INSTANTLY OVERTAKEN WITH
THE MOST INCREDIBLE FEAR I'VE
EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.
>>
>> Stephen: CAROL FOUND OUT
HAVING AN ALIEN IN YOUR BEDROOM
IS NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE, AND
BY THE TIME HE WAS A TEENAGER,
THE ENCOUNTERS BECAME BRUTAL.
>> THE DOOR WAS KICKED OPEN,
BROKE THE DOORKNOB.
THEY JERKED ME OUT OF BED, THREW
ME TO THE FLOOR.
THERE'S A TALLER ENTITY THERE.
HE'S GOT A LONG DEVICE,
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN TO EIGHT,
MAYBE NINE INCHES LONG.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG.
A VERY SHINY LONG NEEDLE-LIKE
DEVICE WITH A LITTLE TINY SILVER
SOMEONE ON THE END OF IT.
HE COMES TOWARDS ME AND THE
LARGE NEEDLE-LIKE DEVICE IS
JAMMED AND IT'S VERY PAINFUL.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
I THINK WE ALL GO WHERE THE
PROBE GOES.
>> IT GOES UP MY NASAL PASSAGE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
STILL, IT'S A CHILLING WARN, AND
ONLY A MAD MAN WOULD TEMPT A
GLOBAL NASAL VIOLATION.
MEET THAT MAD MAN, JOE DAVIS,
ARTIST, INVENTOR AND POSSIBLE
PIRATE WHO HAS ALREADY GIVEN
AWAY EARTH'S POSITION.
>> I TRANSMITTED MORE MESSAGES
TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
THAN ANYONE ELSE, AT LEAST THAN
ANYONE ELSE IN THE UNITED
STATES.
>> WHEN WE RETURN, JOE DAVIS'
SHOCKING MESSAGE.
>> THAT'S A VERY NICE VAGINA.
>> Stephen: I TOLD YOU IT WAS
SHOCKING.
WHAT COULD JOE DAVIS' MESSAGE
MEAN?
WHAT I HOPE IS A SURPRISING
