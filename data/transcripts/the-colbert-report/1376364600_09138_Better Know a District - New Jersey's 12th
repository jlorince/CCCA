(LAUGHTER)
NOW I AM BECOME DEATH.
(LAUGHTER)
DESTROYER OF WORLDS.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, HI THERE!
I WAS JUST PUTTING THE FINISHING
TOUCHES ON THPL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I TOLD MY NEIGHBOR TO STOP TRIM
MIG SIDE OF THE HEDGES OR HE
WOULD REGRET IT.
NOW, THIS LITTLE PUPPY DOWN HERE
WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLY WITHOUT J.
ROBERT OPPENHEIMER OFTEN CALLED
THE FATHER OF THE ATOMIC BOMB--
LEADING TO DEEP INSECURITYS FOR
HIS SON JEFFREY WHO JUST NEVER
MANAGED TO BLOW UP HIROSHIMA.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
NOW, OPPENHEIMER LIVED IN
PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, WHICH IS
LOCATED IN THE SUBJECT OF THE
72nd INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART
SERIES "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT."
TONIGHT, NEW JERSEY'S 12th, THE
FIGHTING 12th!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
OTHER NOTABLE PRINCETONIANS
INCLUDE JAMES MADISON, JIMMY
STEWART, MICHELLE OBAMA AND,
FROM 1933 TO 18955 PRINCETON
HELD THE HONOR OF BEING THE ONLY
TOWN IN AMERICA WHERE YOU COULD
SAY "WAY TO GO, EINSTEIN" AND
HAVE AN OLD MAN SAY "DANG A
SHANE."
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, THE 12th IS ALSO HOME TO
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN
SCALIA, MEANING THAT CLARENCE
THOMAS INSISTS HE'S FROM THERE,
TOO.
IF YOU'RE IN THE 12th DON'T MISS
A NIGHT OUT WITH THE MINOR
LEAGUE TRENTON THUNDER.
THEY'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING
NEW LIKE THE APRIL 30 ORGAN
DONATION AWARENESS NIGHT WHICH,
COINCIDENTALLY, WAS ALSO DOLLAR
HOT DOG NIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND WHO HAS THE JERSEY BOYS TO
REPRESENT SUCH DISTRICTS?
WHY, NONE OTHER THAN DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN AND PHYSICIST RUSH
HOLT.
