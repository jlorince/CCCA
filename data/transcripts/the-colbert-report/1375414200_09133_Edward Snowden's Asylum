THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY.
I'M SORRY, THAT KIND OF
LOVE.
I HAD TO STAND THERE I
THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS CARVING
ME FOR A MONUMENT.
NOW NATION FOR THE LAST
MONTH I HAVE BEEN HOT ON THE
TRAIL OF NSA LEAKER EDWARD
SNOWDEN.
HE HAS ELUDED AUTHORITIES BY
HIDING OUT IN A MOSCOW
AIRPORT.
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE SIGNED
AN EXTRA DECISION TREATY
WITH AU BON PAIN.
WELL NOW, FOLKS, THIS
CYBERTRAITER HAS FLOWN THE
AIRPORT.
MORE THAN A MONTH AFTER
LANDING ATMOS YOU COULD'S
AIRPORT ED SNOWDEN NOW IS ON
THE MOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
THE NSA LEAKER SAID TO BE
LEAVING THE AIRPORT,
OFFICIALLY ENTERING RUSSIA
AFTER BEING GRANTED
TEMPORARY ASYLUM.
>> Stephen: YES, HE HAS GOT
ANSWER SIGH LUM IN RUSSIA
WHERE VLADIMIR PUTIN SHARES
SNOWDEN'S PASSION FOR
TRANSPARENCY.
AND FOLKS THERE IS STARTLING
NEW INFORMATION ON THE NSA'S
SECRET SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS.
IT TURNS OUT EVEN AS HE WAS
ON THE RUN
