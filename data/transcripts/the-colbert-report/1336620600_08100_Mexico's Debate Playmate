( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
COME ON!
KHRAPBT I LOVE IT!
I LOVE IT.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US ONE AND ALL
NATION THANK YOU FOR THAT BURST OF ENERGY.
(LAUGHTER) FRANKLY, I NEED IT.
THE 2012 ELECTION JUST DOES NOT HAVE T SAME VAZZ THAT WE HAD IN 2008.
(LAUGHTER) EVEN "ROLLING STONE" IS ASKING "IS THE THIS THE MOST BORING
ELECTION EVER?" (LAUGHTER) THE ANSWER, NO.
AS ALWAYS IN "ROLLING STONE",
THE TOP SPOT ON ANY LIST MUST GO TO BOB DYLAN'S "HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED."
CLASSIC ALBUM.
BUT, FOLKS, THIS LACK OF PASSION HAS GOT ME FURIOUS.
THIS IS AMERICA GODDAMN IT!
WE INVENTED ELECTIONS!
WE SHOULD HAVE THE MOST EXCITING ONES!
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE HAVING OUR COULO HANDED TO US BY MEXICO!
(APPLAUSE) THEY HAVE GOT THEIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COMING UP ON JULY 1.
OR, AS THEY CALL IT, CINCO DE MAYO.
(LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU WANT TO TALK EXCITEMENT?
JUST LOOK AT THEIR LATEST DEBATE.
>> MEXICO HOSTED ITS FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE OF THE CAMPAIGN SUNDAY NIGHT, BUT NO
ONE WAS LOOKING AT THE CANDIDATES, APPARENTLY.
THAT'S BECAUSE OF, WELL, THIS.
FORMER "PLAYBOY" PLAYMATE JULIAORRIANNA APPEARED AS AN USHER.
HER SKIN TIGHT DRESS AND PLUNGING NECKLINE SENT TWITTER BUZZING ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
ONE CANDIDATE SAID SHE LEFT THE MALE DEBATERS BREATHLESS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVES.
THEIRS SHOULD REALLY WEAR ONE.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, THE CANDIDATES DOWN IN MEXICO HAD TO STRUGGLE TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE DEBATE.
HERE IS NEW AOEU LINES PARTY CANDIDATE GABE GABRIELLE QUADRY ANALYZING HER FIRM REBUTTAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO APOLOGIES FROM QUADRY, HE SIMPLY EXPLAINED IT'S I BELIEVE
POSSIBLE NOT TO CONCENTRATE YOUR ATTENTION ON A WOMAN SO SPECTACULAR.
IT'S ALL SUMMED UP IN HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN "QUADRY, 2012: MI GUSTO LAS GRANDEES."
(APPLAUSE) AND THE YOUNG LADY, THE EX-PLAYMATE, WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION SHE SAT DOWN
FOR AN IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW WITH THE JOURNALIST SOME HAVE CALLED MEXICO'S EDWARD R. MURROW,
MONICO CHIMPANZON.
(LAUGHTER) NOT ONLY ARE THEIR ELECTIONS MORE EXCITING, THEIR CABLE NEWS HAS MORE CREDIBILITY.
(LAUGHTER) WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT UP HERE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT UP HERE?
I MEAN COME ON ANDERSON COOPER!
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK YOU TO MODERATE A DEBATE AS A WHIT
