NATIONAL DEBT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT OF COURSE, FOLKS, ALL OF THIS IS JUST FILLER.
WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE OLYMPIC EVENT I DECLARED THE SPORT OF THE SUMMER,
DRESSAGE.
THE GRACEFUL, INTERPLAY OF MAN AND BEAST.
BUT LEGAL.
NOW THE MEDAL FINAL FOR DRESSAGE OR HORSE BALLET WILL BE HELD TOMORROW.
NOW I'VE BEEN A LIFELONG FAN OF DRESSAGE EVER SINCE A MONTH AGO WHEN I LEARNED
THAT THE ROMNEYS OWN A HORSE RAFALCA WHO IS IN LONDON FOR THESE OLYMPICS.
NOW TECHNICALLY IT IS HIS WIFE'S HORSE.
BUT MITT COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED OR MORE OF A SUPPORTIVE HUSBAND.
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS ANN'S SPORT.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHICH DAY THE SPORT GOES ON.
SHE WILL GET THE CHANCE TO SEE IT.
I WILL NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: M ITT IS JAZZED.
HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE SPORT.
WHEN'S IT ON.
WHAT'S IT'S CALLED.
WHO IS THATï¿½ixDï¿½ï¿½ WOMAN WHO IS ALWAYS HANGING OUT WITHxD ME AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE.
NOW FOLKS, NO SURPRISE.
NO SURPRISE THE LIBERAL CRITICS CALL DRESSAGE ELITIST.
JUST BECAUSE THE UNIFORM MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE LADY MARY'S SUITOR FROM DOWNTON ABBEY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I EXPECTED THIS FROM LIBERALS BUT I DID NOT EXPECT THIS FROM A CONSERVATIVE LIKE CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.
>> I'M NOT SURE WHY THE HORSE HAS TO BE IN THE MOST UPPER-CLASS HOITY-TOITY
OLYMPIC EVENT EVER INVENTED.
IT'S UNNECESSARY.
THEY'RE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
>> HOW DARE YOU, SIR.
(LAUGHTER) DRESSAGE IS
