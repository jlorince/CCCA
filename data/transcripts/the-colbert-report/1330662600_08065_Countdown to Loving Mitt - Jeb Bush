NATION, THE RACE FOR THE GOP
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS
IN THE HOME STRETCH.
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT
PAINS ME TO SAY IT, MITT
ROMNEY HAS GOT THE MOMENTUM.
OR MI PARTICULAR,-- MITTMENTUM.

WYOMING CAUCUS, WYOMING,
CRADLE OF CHENEY.
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S SO
SPARSELY POPULATED.
THEY MUST KILL TO STAY
ALIVE.

CIRCLE OF LIFE.
NOW WITH SUPERTUESDAY COMING
UP NEXT WEEK, I'M NOT SURE
WHICH DAY, WE'LL CHECK THAT

LEFT UNTIL ALL CONSERVATIVES
ARE OBLIGED TO BURY OUR
FEELINGS AND FIND MITT
ROMNEY ATTRACTIVE.
(LAUGHTER)
JIMMY, PUT UP THE
COUNTERDOWN TO LOVING MITT
CLOCK.
OH GOD.
OH GOD, ONLY FIVE DAYS, 23
HOURS, 57 MINUTES.
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME
TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE,
ANYBODY.

BUSH IS STILL CONSIDERED AS
A POSSIBLE LAST DITCH
CANDIDATE.

OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT
