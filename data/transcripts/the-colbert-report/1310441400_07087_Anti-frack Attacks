(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NATION, I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU WE HAVE AN
ENERGY CRISIS ON OUR HANDS.
EVEN OUR MOST VOLATILE
SOURCE OF FUEL LASTS ONLY
FIVE HOURS.
THAT'S WHY I AM SUCH A HUGE
SUPPORTER OF HYDRO FRACKING.
THE DRILLING PROCESS THAT
BLASTS PRESSURIZED WATER,
SAND AND CHEMICALS BELOW THE
EARTH'S SURFACE TO BREAK UP
ROCK AND RELEASE NATURAL
GAS.
IT'S LIKE GIVING THE EARTH
AN ALKA SELLINGER IF THE
ALKA SELLINGER SHATTERED
YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS SO OIL
COMPANY KOS HARVEST YOUR
JUICES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW FOLKS THERE
IS GOOD NEWS ON THE FRACKING
FRONT.
BECAUSE 1 WEEK AGO NEW YORK
GOVERNOR ANDREW COMO
ANNOUNCED THAT HE WANTS TO
LIFT THE BAN ON FRACKING IN
THIS STATE.
AND I SAY FAIR'S FAIR.
AFTER ALL HE JUST SIGNED A
BILL SAYING GAY COUPLES
COULD LEGALLY FRACK EACH
OTHER.
WHY CAN'T ENERGY
COMPANIES --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
YEAH, YOU SEE.
THESE PEOPLE ARE ANGRY TOO.
WHY CAN'T ENERGY COMPANIES
DRILL IN OUR BACKYARD.
NEW YORK --
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OH YEAH, I WENT
THERE.
I LIVE THERE.
NOW IT TURNS OUT NEW YORK IS
OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF
WHAT'S CALL THE MARCEL US
SHALE FORMATION AND FRACKING
IT WILL HELP FREE US OF
DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL.
YOU SEE AMERICA HAS TWO
SAUDI ARABIA'S WORTH OF OIL
IN THE FORM OF NATURAL GAS.
TWO SAUDI ARABIA'S WORTH OF
OIL SO PUT THAT INTO
PERSPECTIVE, THAT'S AS MUCH
OIL AS SIX IRAQS OR ONE SIDE
OF SONIC TATER TOTS.
MY ONLY WORRY, FOLKS, MY
ONLY WORRY IS WE WILL BECOME
TWO DEPENDENT ON OURSELVES
AND END UP INVADING
PENNSYLVANIA.
THAT PLACE IS A QUAGMIRE
FULL OF RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS
AND FANATICS.
UNFORTUNATELY --
(APPLAUSE)
UNFORTUNATELY HYDRO FRACKING
HAS COME UNDER FIRE FOR
CAUSING OTHER THINGS TO COME
UNDER HIRE.
>> THESE CHEMICALS WHICH ARE
VERY DANGEROUS NEUROTOXINS
AND CARCINOGENS AND THE GAS
ITSELF MIGRATE INTO THE
AQUIFERS AND YOU GET THIS
KIND OF SITUATION WHERE
PEOPLE CAN ALL OF A SUDDEN
LIGHT THEIR WATER ON FIRE.
>> I SAY THIS IS AN
IMPROVEMENT.
WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
IN YOUR KEVIN, A BORING OLD
WATER FAUCET OR A BUILT-IN
CREME BRULE MAKER.
AND THAT'S JUST -- THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE
ANTI-FRACK ATTACKS OUT
THERE.
LAST YEAR THE PENNSYLVANIA
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION CITED ONE
FRACKING COMPANY, TALISMAN
ENERGY WITH 145 VIOLATIONS
SUCH AS IMPROPER DISPOSAL OF
DRILL CUTTINGS AND FUEL
SPILLS.
BUT TALISMAN HAS FOUND A WAY
TO COUNTERTHEIR IMAGE
PROBLEM BY RELEASING THIS
ACTUAL COLOURING BOOK TO
EDUCATE KIDS ABOUT HOW GREAT
FRACKING IS.
IT'S CALLED TALLIST --
TALISMAN TERRY'S ENERGY
ADVENTURE STARRING TALISMAN
TERRY THE FRIENDLY
FRACKASAARUS.
THE FUNNEST ENERGY
EXTRACTION BASED CHILDREN'S
CHARACTER SINCE MASSEY
COLE'S MOUNTAINTOP MINING
MANNY WHOSE HEAD BLOWN OFF
SO THEY CAN GET AT HIS
VALUABLE BRAIN COAL.
NOW IN TALISMAN'S COLOURING
BOOK TERRY SAYS NATURAL GAS
IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST,
SAFEST AND MOST USEFUL
ENERGY SOURCES.
AND THAT ONCE A WELL IS
CLOSED, THE LAND IS
RECLAIMED AND RETURNED TO
THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE
TALISMAN CAME TO DRILL.
YOU SEE BEFORE DRILLING,
AFTER DRILLING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IT ACTUALLY GETS
BETTER.
THAT RAINBOW WAS TRAPPED
UNDERGROUND.
BUT THE FRACKING SET IT
FREE.
UNLESS THAT'S NOT A RAINBOW
BUT A GEYSER OF HIGHLY
COMBUSTABLE NEUROTOXINS.
IN WHICH CASE, KIDS, WILL
YOU WANT TO COLOR IT BROWN.
BUT FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST
HARD FACTS LIKE THIS.
THAT, THIS COLOURING BOOK
ALSO TUGS AT THE HEART
STRINGS.
BECAUSE AS TERRY SAYS
NATURAL GAS IS CREATED FROM
ORGANIC MATERIAL LIKE THE
DINOSAUR.
PICTURED RIGHT HERE.
NOW KEEP IN MIND, TERRY IS A
DINOSAUR.
AND HE'S ENCOURAGING US TO
USE THE REMAINS OF HIS OWN
DEAD RELATIVES TO HEAT OUR
HOMES.
AND FOLKS, I HAVE UNCOVERED
SOME BONUS PAGES THAT SHOW
THE REST OF TERRY'S
EMOTIONAL JOURNEY.
HERE'S TERRY DRIVING HOME
FROM WORK GRIEVE STRICTEN AS
THE GOES OF HIS GRANDMOTHER
BILLOWS FROM HIS TAILPIPE.
(APPLAUSE)
AND MARE'S TERRY STARING
INTO HIS OWN HAGGARD
REFLECTION SURROUNDED BY THE
CONDEMNING STARES OF HIS
VIOLATED ANCESTORS, THEN
DRIVEN MAD BY GUILT TERRY
DECIDES TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE
BY STEPPING INTO SHOT WE ARE,
LIGHTING A CIGARETTE AND
LETTING THE FLAMMABLE FRACK
WATER END HIS PAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND, FOLKS, THERE'S A HAPPY
ENDING BECAUSE MILLIONS OF
YEARS AFTER HE'S BURIED KIDS
USE THE GAS PRODUCED BY
TERRY'S FOSSILLIZED REMAINS
TO COOK HOT DOGS.
BY THE WAY, KIDS, WHERE
THOSE HOT DOGS CAME FROM IS
A WHOLE OTHER COLOURING
BOOK.
AND JUST AS HAUNTING.
