MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE STAR OF
THE NEW FILM "DINNER FOR
SCHMUCKS AND DESPICABLE ME."
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT A
SELF-ESTEEM ISSUE.
PLEASE WELCOME STEVE CARELL.
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU,
TOO.
>> HOW'S THE FAMILY?
HOW'S LORRAINE
>> SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, AS ALWAYS,
GREAT.
>> Stephen: THE BUSINESSMAN IN
HOLLYWOOD, YOU GOT THE TWO NEW
FILMS COMING OUT.
"DESPICABLE ME" COMES OUT THIS
WEEKEND.
I'VE SEEN WITH IT THE KIDS.
THANKS FOR THE ADVANCED
SCREENING.
THEY LOVED IT.
LET'S SHOW THE KIDS WHY.
JIM, HIT IT.
>> WE HAVE LOCATED A SHRINK RAY
IN A SECRET LAB, AND WHEN WE
TAKE THIS SHRINK RAY, WE WILL
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PULL THIS
OFF.
WE ARE GOING TO SEE.
WAIT, WAIT!
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU WHAT IT IS
YET.
>> HEY, DAVE.
>> LISTEN UP, PLEASE.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: NICE ACCENT.
>> THANKS.
>> Stephen: MAN OF MANY
SKILLS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: SO, UM, LET ME ASK
YOU THIS.
>> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
SURE.
>> IS THIS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR
YOU, THIS?
>> Stephen:, NO IT IS NOT.
IT IS NOT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT WEIRD?
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT.
IT'S NOT WEIRD IN ANY WAY.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> SEEMS AWKWARD.
IT SEEMS AWKWARD.
>> Stephen: I DON'T THINK IT
IS.
>> I SORT OF DO.
>> Stephen: WELL, I SORT OF
DON'T.
>> WELL, LET'S SETTLE THIS THE
OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
THIS IS "EVEN STEVENS."
WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE UP YOUR
OWN ASS?
TONIGHT IS IT AWKWARD FOR
STEPHEN TO INTERVIEW ME?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: NO.
>> YESSSSSSSSS.
>> Stephen: I AM THRILLED TO
HAVE YOU ON MY SHOW.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT UNCOMFORTABLE.
>> STEVEN, OF COURSE I'M
COMFORTABLE.
I MOVED ON AND GREW UP.
YOU TRICK PERFECTLY NICE PEOPLE
INTO SAYING STUPID THINGS.
>> Stephen: STEVE, I AM
THRILLED FOR YOUR SUCCESS.
HELL, I'M AMAZED BY IT.
NOBODY WHO KNOWS YOU SAW THIS
COMING.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT IS A JOY TO SEE YOU IN
PERSON.
WHEN I JUST SEE YOU IN YOUR
MOVIE, I FORGET HOW FUNNY AND
ATTRACTIVE YOU ARE.
FRANKLY I'M EXCITED.
>> OF COURSE YOU'RE EXCITED,
STEPHEN.
I'M NOT YOUR NORMAL GUEST.
PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF ME.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: STEVEN, I AM AN
INTERNATIONAL MOVIE STAR.
>> Stephen: YES, STEVE, I
SUPPOSE CANADA COUNTS AS
INTERNATIONAL.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, YES, MOST OF MY GUESTS ARE
PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO
SOCIETY, SO BANDERING WITH AN
OLD FRIEND ABOUT MINDLESS
TINSELTOWN IS A WELCOME VACATION
FROM SUBSTANCE.
>> THANKS, STEVEN, IT'S A
VACATION FOR ME, TOO.
I'M USED TO HAVING EIGHT BILLION
PEOPLE WATCH ME ON TV.
DOING "THE REPORT" IS LIKE BEING
IN THE WITNESS RELOCATION
PROGRAM.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: STEVE, STEVE,
STEVE, THEY'RE DIFFERENT SHOWS
AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT JOBS.
MY JOB IS TO INTERVIEW SPARKLING
PERSONALITIES.
OR YOU.
AND YOURS IS TO PROMOTE YOUR
PROJECT, AND I WANT TO GET THE
NAME RIGHT, "FOCUS TEST: THE
MOVIE, STARRING NON-THREATENING
WHITE GUY."
>> YOU ARE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE
YOU'RE STUCK HERE IN THE SAME
BUILDING JUST HALF AN HOUR
LATER.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DOESN'T J.W. STEWART'S TEET COME
WITH AN EXTENSION CORD?
AND THAT LOOKS LIKE THE SAME
DESK CHAIR YOU HAD WHEN WE
SHARED AN OFFICE.
>> Stephen: IT'S A COMFORTABLE
CHAIR, STEVE.
>> WELL, WHEN YOU DO A MOVIE,
YOU CAN GET TEN CHAIRS ANY TIME
YOU WANT.
>> Stephen: OH, TEN CHAIRS,
YOU CAN SEAT EVERYONE WHO SAW
"DAN IN REAL LIFE."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> WELL, STEPHEN, SOME OF US
DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO SIT
AROUND WAITING FOR A PROJECT AS
ESTEEMED AS "THE LOVE GURU."
HOW COME YOUR RAZZ EASY ISN'T ON
THE MANTLE NEAR THE EMMY.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE AN
EMMY, WHICH WOULD LOOK NICE NEXT
TO THE SPIKE TV'S GUY'S CHOICE
AWARD.
THE GUYS ALWAYS DID CHOOSE YOU.
>> I HAVE BEEN SLIMED.
>> Stephen: I HATE YOU.
>> I HATE YOU.
>> Stephen: I HATE YOU.
>> I HATE YOU.
>> Stephen: I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU.
>> I HATE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
>> Stephen: I LOVE YOU.
>> I LOVE YOU.
>> Stephen: I LOVE YOU.
>> I MISS YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU SMELL GOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I KNOW.
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVE GREAT CAREER.
>> AND YOU, YOU HAVE A GREAT
CAREER.
FOR CABLE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: AT LEAST WE'RE NOT
WORKING FOR STEWART.
YEAH.
THAT [BLEEPED] REALLY HELD US
BACK WHILE HE WAS LAUNCHING OUR
CAREERS.
>> Jon: GUYS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I CAN HEAR YOU.
EVERYTHING YOU SAY.
>> Stephen: SORRY.
>> SORRY.
>> Stephen: J.W. STEWART, JUST
CAUGHT UP IN THE EMOTION OF THE
MOMENT.
WE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING WE SAID.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
THAT'S FINE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Jon: ONE LAST QUESTION
SINCE YOU'RE TOGETHER.
UM, HOW DID YOU GET TO LEAVE
"THE DAILY SHOW," BECAUSE THEY
LOCKED THE BARS AND THE WINDOWS
EVERY NIGHT.
I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT OF HERE 2
WHOLE TIME AND IT'S REALLY
SCARY, AND IF THEY FIND OUT...
WHAT?
NO, I'LL BE GOOD.
I'LL BE GOOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> I'M STEVE CARELL.
>> Stephen: AND I'M STEPHEN
COLBERT.
