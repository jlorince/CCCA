OF COURSE, NEWT HAS SOME STRONG
BELIEFS HE HASN'T MADE MONEY OFF
OF-- YET-- LIKE HIS HATRED OF
BARNEY FRANK.
>> IF YOU PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL YOU
OUGHT TO START WITH BARNEY FRANK
GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE
LOBBYISTS HE WAS CLOSE TO AT --
AT FREDDIE MAC.
>> STEPHEN:  YEAH, STRING HIM
UP!
BARNEY FRANK WAS CLOSE TO THE
LOBBYISTS AT FREDDIE MAC, AND
GINGRICH SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE
THOSE LOBBYISTS GAVE NEWT
$1.6 MILLION DOLLARS.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN NEWT WAS
CLOSE TO THEM.
I'M SURE HE WAITED UNTIL THEY
LEFT BEFORE HE PICKED UP THE
BROWN PAPER BAG FULL OF MONEY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'D SAY NEWT HAS WON THIS
FIGHT, BECAUSE ON MONDAY
CONGRESSMAN FRANK ANNOUNCED HIS
RETIREMENT.
THE MAN IS A LION OF THE LIBERAL
ESTABLISHMENT.
FROM THE LOOKS OF HIM, POSSIBLY
THE COWARDLY LION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN I HAVE TO ADMIT
THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
BRAVE MOMENTS FOR THIS FRIEND OF
DOROTHY.
IN 1987 FRANK BECAME THE FIRST
OPENLY GAY CONGRESSMAN OTHER
THAN ALL THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE --
OF COURSE, WHENEVER A TITAN OF
WASHINGTON STEPS ASIDE, THE
TRIBUTES ROLL IN.
LIKE THIS ONE FROM BILL
O'REILLY.
>> IF YOU CHALLENGE FRANK, HE'S
IN YOUR FACE, IF YOU POINT OUT
HIS FAILURES, HE DENIES THEM.
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH HIM ON
ANYTHING, YOU'RE A MORON.
>> STEPHEN:  HIGH PRAISE FROM
PAPA BEAR.
IT'S LIKE HE'S DESCRIBING
HIMSELF.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, NOT ALL REMARKS WERE
POSITIVE, LIKE THIS TWEET POSTED
BY THE TENNESSEE TEA PARTY:
>> GOOD RIDDANCE YOU PERVERTED
SODOMITE PIECE OF (BLEEP).
>> STEPHEN:  SOUNDS HARSH, BUT
IN TENNESSEE, THAT'S THE STATE
MOTTO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THE PRESIDENT OF THE
TENNESSEE TEA PARTY TAMI
KILMARX, QUICKLY TOOK DOWN THE
TWEET, SAYING IT WAS POSTED
WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE,  AND
THOROUGHLY APOLOGIZED ON
FACEBOOK, BY SAYING:
"WHILE I PRIVATELY AND INWARDLY
I MAY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTARY,
IT IS COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE
FOR ANY ONE OF US TO WRITE THESE
KINDS OF COMMENTARIES."
>> STEPHEN:  YES, IT'S FINE TO
AGREE THAT BARNEY FRANK IS A
PERVERTED SODOMITE PIECE OF
(BLEEP) BUT DON'T SAY IT OUT
LOUD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
JUST LIKE WHEN A GAY GUY WALKS
INTO A RESTAURANT YOU DON'T
SCREAM, "HIDE YOUR CHILDREN!
HE'S LOOKING FOR NEW MEAT."
YOU JUST COVER YOUR YOUNG ONE
WITH A COAT UNTIL DANGER PASSES.
RIGHT?
I'M RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO BE TACTFUL.
I THINK KILMARX GAVE THE
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE, SO-- LET'S
TWEET HERE IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE TO
SAY "THIS PIC OF TAMI KILMARX IS
WHY BARNEY FRANK IS GAY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
HASHTAG, THOUGH I PRIVATELY AND
INWARDLY AGREE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT
FUTURE HOLDS FOR FRANK,
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAS PLEDGED:
"I WILL NEITHER BE A LOBBYIST
NOR A HISTORIAN."
FOR AN EX-CONGRESSMAN, THAT ONLY
LEAVES FELON OR FULLY-CLOTHED
EXOTIC DANCER.
