>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
HAS BEEN ROCKED BY SCANDAL
OVER THE PAST DECADE AND I'M
NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THOSE
SICKENING DAN BROWN NOVELS.
I'VE KNOWN MANY CLERGIMAN,
MR. BROWN, AND VERY FEW OF
THEM HAD ACCESS TO
ANTI-MATTER TECHNOLOGY.
OF COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDAL.
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, SHAMEFUL
CHAPTER BUT THERE IS GOOD
NEWS.
THE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE
CONFI CATHOLIC BISHOPS HAS
RELEASED THE RESULTS OF AN
EXHAUSTIVE 1.8 MILLION
DOLLAR STUDY EXAMINING THE
ROOT CAUSES OF THIS TRAGIC
ABUSE OF TRUST.
AND I'M RELIEVED TO REPORT
THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THE
COURAGE TO PLACE THE BLAME
WHERE IT BELONGS, ON FREE
LOVE IN THE 1960s.
(LAUGHTER)
THE DAMN HIPPIES.
OF COURSE DURING THE SUMMER
LOVE IT WAS ALL TOO EASY TO
GET CAUGHT UP IN THE
DEBAUCHERY OF PRIESTSTOCK.
DON'T EAT THE BROWN
EUCHARIST, MAN.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS, IT COULD ALL HAVE
BEEN AVOIDED AS THE STUDY
SAID, POOR TRAINING OF
PRIESTS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED
TO THE ABUSE PROBLEM.
YOU SEE THIS IS NOT A MORAL
FAILING BY THE LEADERSHIP OF
THE CHURCH.
IT IS SIMPLY A TRAINING
ISSUE.
LIKE THE NEW GUY PUTTING THE
WRONG TYPE OF PAPER IN THE
PHOTO COPIER.
EXCEPT IT'S NOT PAPER, AND
IT WASN'T A PHOTO COPIER.
WELL, FOLKS, ONCE AGAIN, IT
FALLS TO ME.
I'M GOING TO FIX THIS THING.
I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE MY
NEW COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTIVE
TRAINING PROGRAM.
JOIN ME AT THE CHRERJKYMATIC
HE CLEESEAS PARTICULAR
CENTER-- ECLESIASTIC CENTER
316.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE ECLESIACTION
CENTER WITH ITS PATENTED DO
NOT-- SCREEN.
NOW IF YOU ARE A MAN OF THE
CLOTH, I WANT YOU TO PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION.
READY?
DO GIVE SERMONS.
COUNCIL YOUR FLOCK.
PREACH THE GOOD WORD.
DON'T MOLEST ANYONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YES,.
>> STEPHEN, I HAVE A
QUESTION.
>> Stephen: NO, THERE ARE NO
QUESTIONS CAN.
(LAUGHTER)
EVER
