EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW ON A REGULAR BASIS, YOU KNOW THAT I AM A BIG PLAYER IN THE MUSIC BIZ.
BY THE BIZ, OF COURSE I MEAN THE INDUSTRY.
I GOT A GRAMMY, A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL WITH AN ALL-STAR ROCK
'N' ROLL CAST, AND I'VE HAD MICHAEL STIPE ON MY BOOK SHELF FOR ALMOST NINE MONTHS.
HOW IS IT GOING OVER THERE,
MICHAEL?
>> WOULD SOMEONE DUST ME?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: HIGH MAINTENANCE.
AND FOLKS, I KNOW ALL THE LATEST, HOTTEST BANDS, LIKE BONNAROO AND LOLLAPALOOZA.
THOSE GUYS ARE GREAT.
NOW IT'S SUMMER, AND THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO REMOUNT MY LONG-RUNNING ONE-YEAR TRADITION
OF THROWING MY OWN SUMMER CONCERT.
LAST YEAR WE HAD JACK WHITE,
BONN EBARE, FLORENCE AND HER MACHINE AT STEVE FEST COLCH ELA '11.
IT TOOK A TEAM OF SURGEONS FOUR HOURS TO SUCCESSFULLY REATTACH THE KNOB.
I GOT TO SAY, THE KNOB HAS LOST SOME SENSITIVITY.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, IN THE MUSIC BIZ, YOU ALWAYS GOT TO REINVENT YOURSELF.
WHETHER IT'S MADONNA OR DAVID BOWIE OR PAUL SIMON AFTER HE HAD THAT WEIRD GROWTH REMOVED.
SO, NATION, TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE MY SECOND ANNUAL SUMMER CONCERT SERIES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEVE FEST OCHELLA '12.
>> Stephen: NATION.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, GET READY TO ROCK.
IN TWO WEEKS.
THE ONLY THING BIGGER THAN FESTIVAL ITSELF IS THIS YEAR'S VENUE.
YOU MAY KNOW HER FROM HER WORK CAPTURING THE MARSHAL ISLANDS DURING WORLD WAR II.
SHE DISPLACES 41,434 TONS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE MOTHER
[BLEEPED] U.S. INTREPID.
GIVE IT UP.
WHEW, WHEW, BABY.
WE'LL BE ON DECK WITH A BOATLOAD OF ROCK TALENT, INCLUDING SANTA
GOLD, GRIZZLY BEAR, THE FLAMING LIPS AND FUN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I LOVE FUN.
I HEAR THEIR SHOWS ARE A TON OF BAND.
AND THE OFFICIAL AIRCRAFT CARRIER-BASED D.J. IS THE PER FECHTOR OF THE SCRATCH, GRAND MASTER FLASH.
DON'T PUSH HIM CAUSE HE'S CLOSE TO THE EDGE.
AND ON THE INTREPID, THE EDGE IS LIKE A 50-FOOT DROP.
FRIDAY, AUGUST 10th AT 7:00 P.M.
FOR MORE INFORMATION, INCLUDING HOW TO GET FREE TICKET, VISIT COLBERTNATION.COM.
TELL THEM I SENT YOU.
THIS WILL BE THE GREATEST THING EVER TO HAPPEN ON THE HUDSON RIVER.
SUCK IT, SULLE
