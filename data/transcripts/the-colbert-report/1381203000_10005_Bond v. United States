(LAUGHTER)NATION, IT'S THE FIRST MONDAY IN
OCTOBER, BACK-TO-SCHOOL DAY FORTHE SUPREME COURT.
AND I AM THRILLED BECAUSE THECASES THIS YEAR ARE TO DIE FOR.
FOR INSTANCE, "BOND V. UNITEDSTATES."
IT'S ABOUT A PENNSYLVANIA WOMANNAMED CAROL BOND WHOSE HUSBAND
KNOCKED UP HER BEST DIFFERENT SOBOND SPREAD LETHAL CHEMICALS ON
HER FRIEND'S CAR, MAILBOX, ANDDOORKNOB.
THE DEAD GIVEAWAY WAS THAT ONEOF THE CHEMICALS-- POTASSIUM
DICHROMATE-- IS BRIGHT ORANGE.
IT'S THE REASON WHY NINJASRARELY KILL WITH TRAFFIC CONES.
(LAUGHTER)BUT IT WASN'T THE CRIME THAT GOT
BOND ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREMECOURT.
NO, IT WAS HER DEFENSE.
HER LAWYERS ARGUE THE LAW SHEWAS CONVICTED UNDER IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON THE GROUNDTHAT IT INFRINGES ON THE POWERS
RESERVED TO THE STATES UNDER THE10th AMENDMENT.
AMEN?
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID CHEMICALWEAPONS ARE A STATE'S RIGHTS
ISSUE.
(LAUGHTER)EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE SHOULD
DECIDE WHAT IS AND ISN'TPOISONOUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT WE IN MY HOMESTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA CONSIDER
A DEADLY TOXIN PEOPLE IN NORTH
