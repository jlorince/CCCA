(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, I DON'T THINK IT'S
ANY SECRET THAT I AM A HUGE
FAN OF RICK SANTORUM.
I HAVE LOVED HIM EVER SINCE
HIS WORK IN DAVEY AND
GOLIATH.
AND NOW THANKS TO HIS STRONG
SHOWING IN IOWA, PEOPLE ARE
REALLY STARTING TO LISTEN TO
RICK BRING THE TRUTH, HOT
AND HEAVY AND STRICTLY
MISSIONARY.
FOR INSTANCE, SPEAKING AT A
DOUBLE NEW
HAMPSHIRE-- DUBLIN, NEW
HAMPSHIRE HIGH SCHOOL ON
FRIDAY SANTORUM CONDEMNED
GAYS AND LESBIANS RAISING
KIDS SAYING EVEN FATHERS IN
JAIL WHO HAD ABANDONED THEIR
KIDS WERE STILL BETTER THAN
NO FATHER AT ALL WHO HAVE IN
THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES.
I MEANS THAT'S JUST COMMON
SENSE.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT ROSIE O'DONNELL IS NOT
AS SUITED TO PARENTING AS
CHARLES CHARLES MANSON.
AFTER ALL, WE KNOW HE WAS A
FAMILY MAN.
SO LESBIAN MOMS, YOU LISTEN
TO RICK.
WHETHER YOU GOT YOUR
CHILDREN THROUGH ADOPTION, A
SURROGATE OR JUST TRIPPED
AND FELL ON SOME DAVID
CROSBY SPERM, YOU MUST DO
WHAT IS BEST FOR THE KID.
LIE AND TELL THEM THAT THEY
HAVE A FATHER BUT THAT HE
ABANDONED THEM AND IS NOW IN
JAIL.
OF COURSE THEY MIGHT ASK YOU
WHEN HE WILL BE OUT.
JUST SAY NEVER, YOUR DADDY
IS ON DEATH ROW FOR MURDER.
NOW YOU'RE WELL ADJUSTED.
OH AND IF YOU HEAR ANY
NOISES LATER IT'S JUST MOMMY
AND HER ROOMMATE PAM MOVING
HEAVY FURNITURE.
BUT FOLKS, WITH RICK LAYING
DOWN THE TRUTH LEFT AND
RIGHT, HE IS BOUND TO BE
MISINTERPRETED BY THE LAME
SCREED MEDIA AND HE HAS COME
UNDER FIRE FOR SOMETHING HE
ALLEGEDLY SAID IN IOWA.
>> I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER BY
GIVING THEM SOMEBODY ELSE'S
MONEY.
I WANT TO GIVE THEM THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT AND
EARN THE MONEY.
>> Stephen: NOW IT SOUNDS
LIKE HE'S SAYING HE DOESN'T
WANT TO MAKE BLACK PEOPLE'S
LIVES BETTER BY GIVING THEM
SOMEBODY ELSE'S MONEY BUT
LUCKILY, A RICK SANTORUM
EXPERT HAS STUDIED THAT
TAPE.
AND HIS CONCLUSIONS HAVE LET
RICK SANTORUM OFF THE HOOK.
JIM?
>> FROM EVERYTHING I SEE,
I'VE LOOKED AT IT SEVERAL
TIMES, I'VE LOOKED AT THAT
QUOTE.
IN FACT I LOOK AT THE VIDEO.
AND I DON'T, IN FACT I'M
PRETTY CONFIDENT I DIDN'T
SAY BLACK.
>> Stephen: END OF STORY.
HE'S PRETTY CONFIDENT HE
DIDN'T SAY BLACK.
HERE'S WHAT HE REALLY SAID.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT IT, WHAT I
STARTED TO SAY AS A WORD AND
SORT OF CHANGED AND IT SORT
OF BLAUHH AND IT CAME OUT
AND PEOPLE SAID I SAID BLACK,
I DIDN'T.
HE SAYS HE SAID BLAHHH AND I
BELIEVE HIM.
JIM?
THEY BELIEVE HIM TOO, THANK
YOU.
JIM, LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT THE TAPE.
>> I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
BLAHHH-- PEOPLE'S LIVES
BETTER BY GIVING SOMEBODY
ELSE'S MONEY.
>> Stephen: CLEARLY HE JUST
STARTED TO SAY A WORD THAT
STARTS WITH BLAAAA AND
CHANGED HIS MIND IT COULD
HAVE BEEN ANYTHING LIKE
BLAAAGOVOVICH PEOPLE.
OR BLAAADER INFECTION
PEOPLE.
IT'S HIGH TIME WE KEEP THOSE
FREELOADERS OFF THE
CRANBERRY JUICE.
OR BLAAACULA PEOPLE.
I'M NOT PAYING SOCIAL
SECURITY FOR ETERNITY.
BESIDES, HE DOESN'T NEED IT
HE LOOKS GREAT.
WE ALL KNOW BLACULA DON'T
CRACULA.
THE POINT IS, RICK SANTORUM
IS NOT EMBRACING THE RACIAL
STEREOTYPE THAT BLACK PEOPLE
ARE ALL ON BELL
FAIR-- WELFARE.
AS HE SAID, HE JUST GOT A
LITTLE TONGUE TIED.
WHO HASN'T BEEN THERE.
YOU'RE TALKING A LOT.
GIVING SPEECH AFTER SPEECH
AND YOU STUMBLE OVER YOUR
WORDS LIKE A DRUNKEN
IRISHMAAAA--PEOPLE.
SOMETIMES THE TONGUE GETS
LAZY.
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S
MEXICAAAAA-- PEOPLE.
THE BOTTOM LINE, BOTTOM
LINE: DON'T TRUST WHAT YOU
HEAR IN THE MEDIA.
WE ALL KNOW IT'S CONTROLLED
BY THE
JEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW --S.
PEOPLE.
NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM
ANTI-SEMITIC BUT I'M PRETTY
CONFIDENT I DIDN'T SAY JEWS.
