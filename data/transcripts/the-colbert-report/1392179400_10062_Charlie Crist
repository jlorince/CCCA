GOVERNOR, WE WILL GET TOWHAT I WOULD CONSIDER YOUR
CHECKERED POLITICAL CAREERIN JUST A MOMENT.
BUT FIRST LET'S GET THISRIGHT OUT OF THE WAY HERE.
YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLEDTHE PARTY IS OVER.
HOW THE EXTREME RIGHTHIJACKED THE GOP AND I
BECAME A DEMOCRAT.
THERE IT IS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU BURIED THE LEAD RIGHT
THERE AT THE END OF THETITLE.
YOU WERE A REPUBLICAN, YOUBECAME A DEMOCRAT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW, AT LONGLAST SIR, HAVE YOU NO SHAME?
>> I AM JUST HAPPY TO BE ADEMOCRAT.
I REALLY FEEL AT HOME.
I ALWAYS KIND OF FELT LIKE AROUND PEG IN A SQUARE HOLE
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
AND IT ONLY INCREASED-- .
>> Stephen: YOU WERE ROUND,THEY WERE SQUARE, THAT MAKES
SENSE.
>> RIGHT T DOES, IT DOES,YES, SIR.
BUT YOU KNOW, AS THE PARTYCONTINUED TO DRIFT FURTHER
AND FURTHER TO THE RIGHT,WITH THE RISE OF THE TEA
PARTY.
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, IJUST GOT MORE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH IT.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS ITABOUT THE MODERN REPUBLICAN
PARTY THAT DIDN'T APPEAL TOYOU ANY MORE.
>> JEB BUSH SAID IT VERYWELL HIMSELF.
THE MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTYLEADERSHIP APPEARS TO BE
ANTI-WOMEN, ANTI-MINORITY,ANTI-IMMIGRANT, ANTI-GAY
COUPLES,ANTI-ENVIRONMENT,
ANTI-EDUCATION.
I MEAN PRETTY SOON THERE ISNOBODY LEFT IN ROOM AND IT
JUST WASN'T A PLACE I WASCOMFORTABLE BEING ANY MORE.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THAT THEWRONG WAY TO LOOK AT IT.
IT IS PRO FREEDOM.
ALL THE THINGS YOU JUSTNAMED INVOLVE SOME KIND OF
REGULATION OR GIVING AWAYOUR FREEDOMS TO PEOPLE
DID NOT EARN IT.
>> THAT'S A POINT OF VIEW.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
IT'S THE CORRECT POINT OFVIEW, OKAY.

I USED TO BE GOVERNOR, HOWABOUT MORE OF THAT.
>> YEAH, WELL, HONESTLY, IWISH IT WERE THAT EASY BUT
THE MAN HAS SAID HE IS GOINGTO SPEND $100 MILLION ON
THIS CAMPAIGN.
HE SPENT $75 MILLION OF HISOWN FOUR YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY-- AREYOU GOING TO SPEND 75
MILLION OF YOUR MONEY THISTIME.
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCHMONEY.
(LAUGHTER)SO NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: WHERE ARE YOUGOING TO GET IT BECAUSE IT'S

>> Stephen: OKAY.
ARE YOU AFRAID OF RICKSCOTT.
>> NO SIR, I'M NOT, I'M NOT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOTAFRAID THAT HE WILL UNHINGE
HIS JAW AND TRY TO SWALLOWYOU.
I MEAN YOU'RE RUNNINGAGAINST A NATIVE FLORIDA
SWAMP CREATURE.
>> HE'S FROM TEXAS.
HE JUST MOVED TO FLORIDA INTIME TO QUALIFY TO RUN.
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE SEVENYEARS BEFORE YOU CAN RUN FOR
GOVERNOR, HE GOT THERE JUSTIN TIME TO BE ABLE TO RUN
FOUR YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU WANTTO BE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA
AGAIN, IT IS A TOUGH STATETO GOVERN.
IT IS A TOUGH STATE TO LIVEIN.
YOU KNOW.
I MEAN IT'S WARM ANDEVERYTHING.
BUT WITHIN IT'S A BEAUTIFULPLACE.
>> Stephen: IT IS A CRAZYSTATE.
>> IT'S INTERESTING.
IT'S NEVER DULL.
BUT IT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID AT THEEND OF YOUR REPUBLICAN
POLITICAL CAREER CAME ABOUTWHEN YOU WERE HUGGED BY
BARACK OBAMA.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> IT FIGURES PROMINENTLY INTHE BOOK IF I MAY READ THAT.
>> YOU INTRODUCED HIM, WHATYEAR.
>> 2009.
>> Stephen: 2009 HE HAD JUSTBECOME PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
YOU INTRODUCED HIM INFLORIDA AND YOU SAID LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE GIVEA WARM FLORIDA WELCOME TO
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAHE WALKED OUT TOWARDS ME.
BOTH OF US SMILED.
THE APPLAUSE WAS JUST ABOUTFRANTIC.
WE SHOOK HANDS.
THE NEW PRESIDENT LEANEDFORWARD AND GAVE ME A HUG.
REACH, PULL, RELEASE.
AS HUGS GO, IT WASN'TANYTHING SPECIAL IT WAS OVER
IN A SECOND, LESS THAN THAT.
IT IS THE KIND OF HUG THATSAYS HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU
MAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THE KIND OF HUG I HADEXCHANGED WITH
THOUSANDS OF FLORIDIANS OVERTHE YEARS.
I DIDN'T THINK A THING ABOUTIT AS IT WAS HAPPENING BUT
THAT SIMPLE GESTURE ENDED MYCAREER. IT
REST OF MY LIFE. REACH, PULL,RELEASE.
( APPLAUSE )>> THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
UNBELIEVABLE.
>> Stephen: REACH, PULL,RELEASE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: ARE THOSE THETHREE WORDS YOU WANT TO USE
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUTTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
>> MAYBE NOT.
MAYBE NOT, NO, BUT-- .
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINKIT ENDED IT FOR YOU?
>> SEVERAL REASONS, I THINK.
NUMBER ONE, IF HE WAS THERETO TALK ABOUT THE RECOVERY
ACT.
THE STIMULUS AS PEOPLE CALLIT.
AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANSTOOK ISSUE WITH THAT.
SO I THINK THAT WAS PART OFIT.
SADLY I THINK ANOTHER PARTOF IT WAS THAT HE WAS A
DEMOCRAT.
BUT NOT JUST A DEMOCRAT, ANAFRICAN-AMERICAN.
AND.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU TO THEGOING TO PLAY THE RACE CARD.
>> I'M TO THE GOING TO PLAYIT.
>> Stephen: YOU JUST DID.
YOU PICKED IT IT UP AGAINAND PUT IN YOUR POCKET, YOU
PLAYED THE RACE CARD.
>> YEAH, WELL I'M JUSTTRYING TO TELL THE TRUTH.
I HAVE SEEN A LEVEL OFVITRIOL DIRECTED AT THIS
PRESIDENT THAT I HAVE NEVERSEEN DIRECTED AT, YOU KNOW,
PRESIDENT KENNEDY OR MAYBEPRESIDENT JOHNSON OR EVEN
PRESIDENT CARTER.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
IF IN THE COURSE OF THECAMPAIGN YOU WERE APPROACHED
BY THREE MEN WHO WERE ABOUTTO HUG YOU, JOSEPH STALIN,
DARTH VADER OR BARACK OBAMA,YOU HAVE TO HUG ONE OF THEM,
WHICH WOULD IT BE.
>> MY PRESIDENT, NOQUESTION.
I LOVE HIM.
>> Stephen: BARACK OBAMA.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELL, GOVERNOR,
GOOD LUCK.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: PLEASE COME BACKONCE YOU'RE THE GOVERNOR
AGAIN.
YOU JUST GOT THE COLBERTBUMP.
