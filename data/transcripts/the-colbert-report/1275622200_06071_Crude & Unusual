MIND.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, WE HAVE ALL BEEN
HORRIFIED BY THIS OIL SPILL IN
THE GULF OF MEXICO, BUT I AM
HAPPY TODAY TO REPORT THERE WAS
FINALLY SOME GOOD NEWS FROM B.P.
JIM?
>> THE RISKY ATTEMPT TO PLUG THE
LEAK IN THE GULF OF MEXICO,
WORKERS FREE THE SAW THAT GOT
STUCK WHILE CUTTING THE DAMAGED
PIPE.
>> STEPHEN: THEY GOT THEIR SAW
BACK.
I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE IT WAS A
REALLY NICE SAW.
IT HAD DIAMONDS ON IT.
THEY CHOSE IT FOR THE OCCASION
BECAUSE, LIKE A DIAMOND, THIS
OIL SPILL IS FOREVER.
[LAUGHTER]
AND GETTING THAT SAW BLADE FREE
ALLOWED B.P. TO CUT THROUGH THE
UNDERSEA PIPE, WHICH MEANS MORE
GOOD NEWS.
>> 20% MORE LIKELY OIL IS
SPEWING THAN WAS BEFORE BECAUSE
THEY'VE OPENED UP THE HOLE
BIGGER.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S ALL PART OF
B.P.'S NEW STRATEGY -- DERANGE
THE EARTH AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
AND EXPERTS ARE ESTIMATING THE
OIL COULD CONTINUE LEAKING
THROUGH CHRISTMAS, WHICH MEANS
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE HOT
HOLIDAY TOY THIS YEAR WILL BE
THE CLEAN IT YOURSELF.
EGRET.
FOLKS, JUST THINK OF THEIR
FACES.
AND, FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IN THE FACE OF THIS TRAGEDY, I'M
BEGINNING TO WONDER JUST HOW
COMMITTED THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION REALLY IS TO
FIXING THIS MESS BECAUSE THEY
ARE DISMISSING THE ONE BOLD
SOLUTION THAT WE KNOW WOULD
WORK.
>> AS FOR THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR
OPTION, LITERALLY THAT'S MAKING
THE ROUNDS ON THE WEB,
DETONATING SOME SORT OF NUCLEAR
DEVICE NEAR THE OIL WELL SHAFT,
THE PENTAGON TELLS US NO
CONSIDERATION, SERIOUS THAT IS,
BEING GIVEN TO THAT IDEA AT ALL.
>> THEY SAY THE NUCLEAR OPTION
HAS NEVER BEEN ON THE TABLE.
>> STEPHEN: NEVER ON THE TABLE?
THE NUCLEAR OPTION IS ALWAYS ON
THE TABLE.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, WE'LL NEVER USE IT,
BUT IT ACT AS A DETERRENT
AGAINST THAT OIL SPILL, AND WE
ALREADY KNOW IT HAS CHEMICAL AND
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS BECAUSE IT IS
THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES, NUKING OIL WELLS IS
PROVEN TECHNOLOGY.
THE RUSSIANS HAVE USED NUKES TO
STOP LEAKS LIKE THIS FIVE TIMES
ALREADY.
SO TO BE FAIR, THEY ALSO USE
NUKES WHEN THEY GET LOCKED OUT
OF THEIR HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, IF
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, FOLKS, AN
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ACTUALLY
SAID THE NUKE PLAN "IS CRAZY."
YEAH.
CRAZY AWESOME.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WE NEED AWESOME SOLUTIONS TO
DEAL WITH THIS KIM JUNG OIL.
SURE, IT'S NOT GUARANTEED TO
WORK, AND SURE NO ONE KNOWS HOW
THE RADIATION WOULD SPREAD OR
AFFECT WILDLIFE, AND SURE IT
WOULD VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL
TREATIES, BUT COME ON.
IT WOULD TURN THE BOTTOM OF THE
OCEAN TO GLASS.
HOW COOL IS THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
AND IF WE NUKED THE SEAFLOOR AND
TURNED IT TO GLASS, WE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DO ANY MORE EXPLORATORY
DRILLING.
WE COULD JUST SEE WHERE THE OIL
IS.
[LAUGHTER]
PUSH THE BUTTON, PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
THIS IS NO TIME TO WAVE THE
WHITE FLAG.
FOR ONE THING, WITH ALL THAT
