FOLKS, IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T GET
CHRISTMAS.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, CONGRESSMAN JIM
McDERMOTT USED THE BIBBY JESUS
TO PUSH HIS PRO-POOR PEOPLE
AGENDA.
JIM.
>> THIS IS CHRISTMASTIME.
WE TALK ABOUT GOOD SAMARITANS.
WE TALK ABOUT THE POOR AND THE
LITTLE BABY JESUS IN THE CRADLE
AND ALL THIS STUFF, AND THEN WE
SAY TO THE UNEMPLOYED, WE WON'T
GIVE YOU A CHECK TO FEED YOUR
FAMILY.
THAT'S SIMPLY WRONG.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE IT'S
WRONG.
WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING TO THEM
AT ALL.
( LAUGHTER )
THEY'VE GOT UNEMPLOYMENT COOTIE,
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE UPSET
BY McDERMOTT'S FLAGRANT
INJECTION OF CHARITY INTO THE
CHRISTMAS SEASON.
SO IS PAPA BEAR BILL O'REEL EYE.
HE WROTE, "EVERY FAIR-MINDED
PERSON SHOULD SUPPORT GOVERNMENT
SAFETY NETS FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED
ASSISTANCE THROUGH NO FAULT OF
THEIR OWN, BUT GUYS LIKE
McDERMOTT DON'T MAKE A
DISTINCTION.
FOR THEM BABY JESUS WANTS US TO
PROVIDE WHATEVER THE
CIRCUMSTANCE.
BEING A CHRISTIAN, I KNOW WHILE
JESUS PROVIDED CHARITY AT THE
HIGHEST LEVEL, HE WAS NOT
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE."
GOOD POINT, BILL, JESUS SAID WE
ONLY HAVE TO LOVE THOSE WHO
DESERVE IT.
AND WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT
BILL'S ARGUMENT IS ITS COMPLETE
FACTUAL INACCURACY.
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE INCONVENIENT
TO GUYS LIKE US TO REPEAT WHAT
JESUS ACTUALLY SAID.
FOR INSTANCE, IF SOMEONE WANTS
YOUR COAT, GIVE THEM YOUR CLOAK,
AS WELL.
RICH PEOPLE SHOULD SELL ALL
THEIR POSSESSIONS AND GIVE THE
MONEY TO THE POOR.
PLUS THE FACT IS JESUS WAS WAY
BEYOND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.
HE WAS SELF-SACRIFICIAL.
THE GUY IS GOD.
HE COULD HAVE FLOATED OFF THIS
CROSS LIKE CRISS ANGEL MIND
MINDFREAK.
AND I LOVE HOW BILL CLOSES WITH
"THE LORD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP
THEMSELVES," KIND OF IMPLYING
THAT JESUS SAID THAT, WHEN IT
WAS ACTUALLY BEN FRANKLIN, WHO I
BELIEVED BELCHED OUT THAT
PROVERB BETWEEN MOUTHFULS OF
FRENCH WHORE.
BUT AS MUCH AS I'M A FAN OF
BILL'S WILLFULLY IGNORANT,
BORDER LINE HERETICAL
SELF-JUSTIFICATION, I GOT TO TIP
MY HAT TO BERNIE GOLDBERG, WHO
CAME ON "THE FACTOR" TO CALL
JESUS LIKE HE SEES-ES.
JIM.
>> AS A MATTER OF FACT, JESUS
WOULD PROBABLY BE EXCEPT FOR ONE
WERE TO ISSUES A LIBERAL
DEMOCRAT IF HE WERE AROUND
TODAY.
>> Stephen: YES, JESUS WAS A
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT.
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN HIS NAME,
JESUS THE MENT CHRIST.
THAT "H" CLEARLY STANDS FOR
HUSSEIN.
PLUS JESUS IS ALWAYS FLAPPING
HIS GUMS ABOUT THE POOR, BUT NOT
ONCE DID HE CALL FOR TAX CUTS
FOR THE WEALTHIEST 2% OF ROMANS,
EVEN THOUGH THEY CREATE ALL THE
GOOD SLAVE JOBS.
AND DON'T FORGET, JESUS HUNG OUT
WITH TAX COLLECTORS AND
PROSTITUTES.
AND NO GOOD CONSERVATIVE WOULD
BE CAUGHT DEAD WITH TAX
COLLECTORS.
WHAT FRIGHTENS ME...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHAT FRIGHTENS ME REALLY, WHAT
REALLY FRIGHTENS ME ABOUT THIS
IS NOW WE KNOW WE GOT A LIBERAL
JESUS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND
OF THE FATHER.
HE'S BASICALLY YAHWEH'S JOE
BIDEN.
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THE BIG GUY,
WE CAN END UP WITH A SOCIAL
DEITY REDISTRIBUTING MY LOAVES
AND FISHES.
IT HURTS ME TO SAY THIS, FOLKS,
BUT IF JESUS REALLY IS A
LIBERAL, IT'S TIME TO GET THE
CHRIST OUT OF CHRISTMAS.
NOW LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN, YOU
KNOW ME.
YOU KNOW ME.
I'M NO FAN OF THE TERM X-MASS OR
X-ANYTHING.
I MAKE MY KIDS PLAY CHRIST-BOX
360.
AND IF THEY BREAK A BONE, THEY
GET CHRIST-RAYS.
BUT IT IS TIME THE TAKE BABY
JESUS OUT OF THE MANGER.
REPLACE HIM WITH SOMETHING
EASIER TO SWALLOW.
HOW ABA HONEY BAKED HAM?
BECAUSE IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A
CHRISTIAN NATION THAT DOESN'T
HELP TO POOR, WE HAVE TO PRETEND
THAT JESUS WAS JUST AS SELFISH
AS WE ARE, OR WE HAVE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE COMMANDED
FORCE LOVE THE POOR AND SERVE
THE NEEDY WITHOUT CONDITION, AND
THEN ADMIT THAT WE JUST DON'T
WANT TO DO IT.
