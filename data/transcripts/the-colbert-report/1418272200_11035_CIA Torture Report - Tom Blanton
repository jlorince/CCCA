>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
NATION, IN THE "A" BLOCK OF THESHOW I TOLD YOU WHY RELEASING
THE TORTURE REPORT WAS A BADIDEA. BUT I'M A POSITIVE GUY.
I WOULD RATHER SEE THE GLASS ASHALF FULL
OF WATER THAT CAN BE FORCED UP APRISONER'S NOSE.
TO HELP ME DO THAT RIGHT NOW,PLEASE WELCOME THE DIRECTOR
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHIVEAT GEORGE WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY, TOM BLANTON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGBACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
ALL RIGHT, TOM, FIRST OF ALL,GREAT UNIVERSITY YOU GOT DOWN
THERE.
I WAS DOWN THERE ON MONDAY.
LOVELY PLACE.
>> YEAH, SHUT DOWN THE WHOLECAMPUS.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, THISDOCUMENT HERE, THIS IS JUST A
PARTISAN BLAME BUSH DOCUMENT,RIGHT?
>> IT'S JUST THE TIP OF THEICEBERG. IT'S THE EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY OF A HUGE STUDY -->> Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S 528 PAGES.
HOW MUCH MORE IS THERE?
>> WHAT'S THE BIG ONE?
SIX MILLION PAGES OF EVIDENCE ISWHAT THEY'RE CITING IN HERE, SIX
MILLION PAGES.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,WAIT A SECOND.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING SMALLERFOR ME TO READ, LIKE MAYBE A
POP-UP BOOK, THOUGH I DON'TNECESSARILY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE POPPING UP.
ALRIGHT, YOU READ THIS THING.
WHAT IS IN HERE THAT SURPRISEDYOU?
>> I'M A DOCUMENT FETISHIST, ANDTHERE'S QUOTE AFTER QUOTE AFTER
QUOTE -->> Stephen:  SO THIS IS "50
SHADES OF GRAY "FOR YOU.
>> YOU GOT IT.
FROM THE C.I.A. ITSELF SHOWINGTHE TORTURE WAS WRONG AND THEY
KNEW IT. CONSTANT PEOPLE FROMTHESE BLACK SITES SAYING
WAIT A SECOND.
THIS GOES TOO FAR.
THIS IS WRONG, WE CAN'T DO THIS.
I GOTTA LEAVE.
THIS IS A TRAIN WRECK.
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE WHEN ITGOES OFF THE CLIFF.
THAT'S C.I.A. COMMENT.
>> Stephen: REMEMBER, WE HEARDABOUT THIS.
WE HEARD ABOUT THE STUFF YEARSAGO.
IT WAS THREE GUYS. THEY WEREWATERBOARDED,
SOME PEOPLE WERE ROUGHED UP ANDTHAT'S IT.
>> IT TURNS OUT IT'S MORE LIKE128 GUYS. TURNS OUT ABOUT 30
OF THEM WERE PUT IN COFFINS,SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DOUSED IN
COLD WATER.
ONE OF THEM DIED.
IT'S BIGGER THAN THEY LET ON.
AND EVEN WORSE.
♪ SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFFOOOH-OOO♪♪
I'M SORRY, I JUST NEED TO DIPBACK IN THERE EVERY SO OFTEN.
>> I UNDERSTAND AND I DON'TBLAME YOU.
>> Stephen: BUT WHAT IS THEVALUE OF DOING THIS?
NOW KOREA AND NORTH KOREA ANDCHINA HAVE SAID AMERICA IS A
HYPOCRITE.
>> THAT'S THE FUNNY THING, THESETECHNIQUES WERE TAKEN FROM THE
CHINESE COMMUNISTS.
THEY DID IT TO OUR P.O.W.s,THEY WATERBOARDED THEM TO MAKE
THEM MAKE FALSE CONFESSIONS FORPROPAGANDA PURPOSES. THEN
OUR MILITARY STARTED TRAININGOUR GUYS TO RESIST CAPTIVITY,
IT'S A COUPLE OF THESE SURVIVALSHRINKS, THE PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO
RAN THE AIR FORCE SURVIVALTRAINING PROGRAM --
>> Stephen:  THE GUYS TRYINGTO HELP OUR SOLDIERS RESIST
TORTURE-->> THEY SOLD IT TO THE C.I.A.
>> Stephen: THE TWO GUYS,DR. MITCHELL AND A DR. JESSON--
>> JIM AND BRUCE.
>> Stephen: THEY GOT HOW MUCHMONEY TO DO THIS?
>> $81 MILLION.
THAT'S ONE OF THE FACTS YOU CANFIND OUT IN HERE.
>> Stephen: $81 MILLION TODESIGN THIS THING.
I'M GOING TO BE OUT OF A JOBSOON.
IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET SOMEOF THAT MONEY?
>> YOU NEED TO BE A FRIEND OFTHEIRS.
THEY HIRED ALL THEIR FRIENDS.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WEREDOING. MITCHELL AND JESSON HAD
NEVER HAD A SINGLEINTERROGATION IN THEIR WHOLE
CAREERS -- NEVER DONE ITTHEMSELVES
THEY CAME IN WITH THESETECHNIQUES THEY GOT FROM THE
CHINESE COMMUNISTS WHO WERETORTURING OUR P.O.W.s AND
SAID, "THIS IS HOW WE CAN TAKECARE OF THOSE TERRORISTS."
>> Stephen: DON'T GET MEWRONG.
I BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW.
THIS IS A COUNTRY OF LAWS, BUTOUR ENEMIES ARE BRUTAL, AND
DON'T WE HAVE TO BE BRUTAL INRETURN?
>> IF WE MIRROR IMAGE THE BADGUYS, THEN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE
EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE FIGHTINGFOR.
>> Stephen: WE'RE FIGHTING FOROUR LIVES.
( APPLAUSE )OKAY, WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR
LIVES.
ANOTHER THIS IS-- I MEAN, YES,THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE
SHOULDN'T DO, BUT SHOULDN'T ITBE LIKE THE ATOMIC BOMB-- THAT
WE, OBVIOUSLY, WILL NEVER USEIT, BUT, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S GOT TO
BE AN OPTION THAT'S ON THE TABLEAT ALL TIMES BECAUSE WE'RE IN AN
EXISTENTIAL FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES?
>> THE MOST DAMNING THING INTHIS REPORT IS NOT THE
HYDRATION.
THE MOST DAMNING THING IN THEREPORT IS IT USES THE C.I.A.'S
OWN DOCUMENTS TO GO THROUGH ALL20 CASES WHERE THE C.I.A.,
PRESIDENT BUSH, EVERYBODY SAIDTHIS TORTURE PREVENTED TERROR.
AND THIS REPORT SHOWS EVERY ONEOF THOSE 20 CLAIMS ARE FALSE.
THE KEY INFORMATION THAT LED USTO BIN LADEN DID NOT COME FROM
TORTURE.
THE KEY INFORMATION THAT BROKEUP THE DIRTY BOMB BLOT PLOT DID
NOT COME FROM TORTURE.
THESE SHRINKS, PSYCHOLOGISTS,WERE THE ONES WHO GOT TO
EVALUATE THEIR OWN PROGRAM.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY DID NOTGIVE EACH OTHER A FAILING GRADE.
>> Stephen: SO THEY GOT TOEVALUATE WHETHER THEIR PROGRAM
WAS WORKING?
>> YOU GOT IT.
>> Stephen: THEY WERE THEIROWN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE?
>> YOU GOT IT.
>> Stephen, OF COURSE, IF IWERE THEM I WOULD GIVE ME A GOOD
GRADE BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IWOULD DO TO ME IF I CROSSED ME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
TOM BLANTON, NATIONAL SECURITYARCHIVE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
