EVERYBODY.
MY NEXT GUEST IS A MUSIC LEGEND
WHO HAS WRITTEN A NEW CHRISTMAS
SONG.
I CAN'T WAIT THE FIND OUT HOW
GRANDMA GETS RUN OVER THIS TIME.
PLEASE WELCOME MR. PAUL SIMON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, PAUL, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
>> YOU TOO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR.
WELL, NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: I AM SUPER EXCITED
THAT YOU... HAVE YOU EVER DONE A
CHRISTMAS SONG BEFORE?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IS THIS YOUR WAY
OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW YOU'VE
ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD
AND SAVIOR?
>> THAT'S TO BE REVEALED
LATERMENT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I HAVE A
BUCKET OF WATER OVER.
THERE I'M READY TO MAKE THIS
OFFICIAL.
( LAUGHTER ) LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE SUBJECT AT HAND.
YOUR NEW CHRISTMAS SONG, I
LOOKED A AT SOME OF THE LYRICS.
IT SAYS, "I GOT A NEPHEW IN
IRAQ, IT'S HIS THIRD TIME BACK,
BUT IT'S ENDING UP THE WAY IT
BEGAN WITH A TURKEY DINNER IN
THE MOUNTAINTOP IN PAKISTAN."
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY "CHESTNUTS
ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE."
>> WELL, THE SONG IS CALLED
"GETTING READY FOR CHRISTMAS
DAY."
THE TITLE COMES FROM A SERMON
THAT WAS WRITTEN IN 141 BY A
REVEREND JM GATES.
I JUST ENJOYED THAT PARTICULAR
SERMON, AND THEN I WAS IN THE
STUDIO, AND I WAS MAKING A...
JUST WITH MUSICIAN, IMPROVISING
A TRACK, A COMPOSITION.
AND WHEN IT WAS OVER, I SAID,
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
PUT THAT SERMON ON TOP OF IT.
AND THE SERMON FIT RHYTHMICALLY.
>> Stephen: THE ACTUAL SERMON?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO YOU SAMPLED.
>> YES, IT'S A SAMPLE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU SAMPLED.
YOU DROPPED SOMEONE ELSE'S BEAT?
>> WELL, NOT THAT KIND OF
SAMPLE, BUT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU MEAN.
MOST SAMPLES...
>> Stephen: GOOD.
NOT MANY OF MY GUESTS DO.
SO YOU SAMPLE THIS GUY.
YOU SAMPLED THIS GUY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND THAT WAS AN
INSPIRATION FOR YOU?
NOW, DID YOU HAVE THE LYRIC AT
THAT POINT?
>> NO, I HAD NOTHING EXCEPT THE
TITLE OF HIS SERMON, "GETTING
READY FOR CHRISTMAS DAY," WHICH
IS A VERY DARK VISION OF
CHRISTMAS.
AND, MINE...
>> Stephen: LIKE DARK VISION
OF CHRISTMAS LIKE WHAT, LIKE
TURKEY RETURNS?
>> WELL, GETTING READY.
EVERYBODY IS GETTING READY FOR
CHRISTMAS DAY, BUT YOU KNOW WHO
ELSE IS GETTING READY FOR
CHRISTMAS DAY IN THAT'S WHO IS
GETTING READY FOR YOU ON
CHRISTMAS DAY, THE POLICE,
THE...
>> Stephen: THE DEVIL.
>> YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THE DEVIL IS READY
FOR YOU ON CHRISTMAS KAY.
LET'S GET TO THE GOOD STUFF.
WE'LL TA
