(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
COLBERT SUPERPAC IS OFFICIALLY
BACK.
AND GUESS-- I FEEL T I FEEL
IT TOMORROW IS JANUARY 31st.
WHEN OF COURSE WE'LL ALL BE
CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY
MONTH EVE WAITING FOR
FREDERICK DOUGLASS TO COME
DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FILL
OUR STOCKINGS WITH GUILT.
BUT TOMORROW IS ALSO THE
DEADLINE FOR ALL SUPERPACS
TO AT LAST FILE THEIR
FINANCIAL-DISCLOSURE REPORTS
WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION.
UP UNTIL NOW WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHO WAS FUNDING THESE
SUPERPACS.
THE GREAT DAY FOR
TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE
TOMORROW VOTERS IN IOWA, NEW
HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA
AND FLORIDA WILL FINALLY
HAVE THE VITAL INFORMATION
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL
BEFORE THEY VOTED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW WE, WE AT
COLBERT SUPERPAC HAVE
PROPERLY FILLED OUT ALL THE
ACTUAL PAPERWORK WHICH WE
WILL FILE AT MIDNIGHT
TONIGHT.
AND POST ON THE COLBERT
SUPERPAC WEB SITE AND WHICH
WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW
MUCH WE HAVE RAISED.
I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO BE PLEASANTLY
DROPPING A LOAD IN THEIR
PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW FOLKS, THE
FILING, THIS FILINGS ALSO
CONTAINS THE NAMES OF EVERY
DONOR WHO GAVE US MORE THAN
$200.
GREAT AMERICANS LIKE IBIN
YERKINNOFF.
LARRY BALLSAGNA.
PAT MAGROIN AND FRUMUNDA
MABALLZ.
AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A
SECOND HERE TO THANK ALL OF
YOU DONOR
