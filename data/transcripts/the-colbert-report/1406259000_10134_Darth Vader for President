(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
NATION, THE 2016PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS
CLOSER THAN YOU THINK,UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT
TWO YEARS AWAY.
BUT THE RACE WAS JUST ROCKEDBY A BOMBSHELL POLL
CONDUCTED BYSTATISTICAL SAVANT
AND COCKIEST GUY INYOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE
NATE SILVER.
IN 2012 WHEN HE WAS STILLWORKING AT THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
SILVER NAILED EVERY ONE OF HISELECTION PREDICTIONS.
NOW HE'S OVER AT ESPN.
BUT HE'S STILL DOING VITALANALYSIS.
CASE IN POINT, HIS RECENTPOLL COMPARING THE
FAVORABILITY RATINGS OF STARWARS CHARACTERS.
(LAUGHTER)YES, NATE SILVER IS NOW
OFFICIALLY IN A GALAXY FAR,FAR AWAY FROM JOURNALISM.
THE STAR WARS RESULTS WERETHEN PICKED UP BY "THE
WASHINGTON POST" WHO FURTHERCRUNCHED THE NUMBERS.
AND FOUND THAT DARTHVADER IS
POLLING HIGHER THAN ALLPOTENTIAL 2016 PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THIS IS SHOCKING.
A GROUP OF BROADLYOUTLANDISH UNBELIEVABLE
CHARACTERS ARE LESS POPULARTHAN THE PEOPLE FROM AS FAR
WARS-- STAR WARS.
LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO THERESULT, EVERYBODY.
YOU GOT EMPEROR PALPATINERUNNING EVENING WITH MARCO
RUBIO.
NOW MANY PEOPLE EXPECTEDPALPATINE TO DO BETTER
AGAINST THE FLORIDA SENATORBUT REMEMBER IN FLORIDA
THEY'RE SUSPICIOUS OF ANYONEWEARING A HOODIE.
AND WITH GOOD REASON, WITHGOOD REASON.
AND ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE,HILLARY CLINTON IS TRAILING
WELL BEHIND YODA WHO, AT 900YEARS OLD STILL GETS FEWER
FOX NEWS QUESTIONS ABOUT HISAGE
HE LOOKS GOOD, HAD A LITTLEWORK DONE, HE HAS.
NOW SOME WILL SAY THATLUMPING TWO UNRELATED POLLS
TOGETHER IS LIKE COMPARINGCORELIAN APPLES TO
MANDALORIAN ORANGES-- LOOKIT UP-- BALL'S IN YOUR COURT
JON STEWART.
BUT NATION, THESE NUMBERSDON'T LIE.
SO BASED ON THESE RESULTSI'M OFFICIALLY ENDORSING
DARTH VADER FOR PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, LET'S FACE IT, THE
ELECTORATE IS BECOMING MOREAND MORE DIVERSE AND THERE'S
NO QUESTION HE IS A STRONGBLACK CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER)AND HE'S GOT A PLAN TO PUT
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK WITH AMASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE
PROGRAM.
PLUS LORD VADER IS A VETERANFIGHTER PILOT WHO KNOWS WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO WORK IN AN OVALOFFICE.
SO VOTE VADER-BINKS 2016,MESAH PROVE THIS MESSAGE.
