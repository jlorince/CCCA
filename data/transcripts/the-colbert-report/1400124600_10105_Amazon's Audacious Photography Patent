(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, NATION, I LOVE THEU.S. OF A  AND THERE
ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT MAKEAMERICA GREAT.
WE INVENTED FLIGHT, WESEQUENCE DNA.
WE PUT CHEESE INSIDE APIZZA CRUST.
BY MANIPULATING THE PIZZA'SDNA.
AND ALL THOSE OTHER INNOVATIONSRIGHT THERE HAVE ONE THING
IN COMMON.
THEY ARE PATENTED. PATENTS ARE AFAST TRACK TO MONEY TOWN
AFTER THOMASEDISON PATENTED HIS LIGHT
BULB HE WAS ROLLING IN CASHWHICH HE SPENT PERFECTING
HIS GREATEST INVENTION,THOMAS'S ENGLISH MUFFINS
WHICH OF COURSE STARTED AS AFAILED ATTEMPT AT A
PHONOGRAPH RECORD.
THE BEST PART IS YOU DON'TNEED TO INVENT THE LIGHT
BULB TO RECEIVE A PATENT.
BECAUSE THE CASH GENERATINGRIGHTS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO
SUCH ACTUAL INVENTIONS ASTHE NECK FANNIE PACK, THREE
LEGGED PANTY HOSE AND THEGERBIL SHIRT.
WHICH INNOVATIVELY COMBINESA SHIRT, A GERBIL HABITAT
AND BEING ALONEFOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
BEST OF ALL, BEST OF ALL,EVEN IF YOUR INVENTION NEVER
MAKES A PENNY, ACCUSINGSOMEONE OF STEALING IT CAN.
BECAUSE IN 2011 ALONE UNUSEDPATENTS GENERATED $29
BILLION IN LAWSUITS, LEGALFEES AND SETTLEMENTS WORTH
TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONSOF DOLLARS.
SO IN YOU HAVE AN IDEA, YOUWORK HARD, SOME DAY YOU TOO
CAN GET SUED BY SOMEONE WHOHAD A SIMILAR IDEA.
AND FOLKS, THE PATENT GAMEHAS JUST BEEN ELEVATED TO AN
ART FORM BY AMAZON.
WHO IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTEDHAS BEEN GRANTED THE PATENT
FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AGAINST AWHITE BACKGROUND.
YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.
AMAZON NOW HAS LEGALOWNERSHIP OF THE IDEA OF
DISPLAYING A THING.
WAIT, WAIT, JIMMY, NO, THATLOGO IS ON A WHITE
BACKGROUND.
QUICK, CHANGE IT TOSOMETHING THAT AMAZON WON'T
OBJECT TO.
THAT'S BETTER OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD.
NOW THOUGH THAT ISTECHNICALLY STILL WHITE,
BECAUSE NOW IF ANYONEDISPLAYS SOMETHING ON A
WHITE BACKGROUND AMAZONCOULD SERVE THEM WITH A
LAWSUIT.
WHICH OF COURSE WILL BEDELIVERED IN A MASSIVE BOX
THAT IS 90% BUBBLE PACK.
AND AMAZON DID A BANG UP JOBOF MAKING THIS IDEA SOUND
LIKE A THING THEY HAVETHOUGHT OF, BECAUSE IN THEIR
PATENT AMAZON DESCRIBES INONE PITHY SENTENCE A
BACKGROUND COMPRISING AWHITE CYCLORAMA, A FRONT LIGHT
SOURCE POSITIONED IN ALONGITUDINAL ACCESS INTERSECTING
THE BACKGROUND AND IMAGE CAPTUREBETWEEN THE BACKGROUND AND
FRONT LIGHT SOURCE IN THELONGITUDINAL ACCESS AND
ELEVATED PLATFORM POSITIONEDBETWEEN THE IMAGE CAPTURE
POSITION AND THE BACKGROUNDIN THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS TO
THE FRONT LIGHT SOURCE BEINGDIRECTED TOWARD A SUBJECT ON
THE ELEVATED PLATFORM.
NOW I KNOW, I KNOW THATSOUNDS LIKE BULL [BLEEP],
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MALEBOVINE FECAL MATTER EXTRUDED
ON A LONGITUDINAL AXIS.
WELL, FOLKS, WELL, FOLKS,I'M SO IMPRESSED BY AMAZON'S
STATE OF THE ART CALLING OFDIBS. STEPHEN WANTS IN.
TONIGHT I AM OFFICIALLYFILING A PATENT ON THE IDEA
OF FILING PATENTS.
THE MECHANISM-- (APPLAUSE)
THE MECHANISM IS SIMPLE.
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL DROPS OFFA PATENT APPLICATION AT THE
PATENT OFFICE, THE SECONDTHE PATENT HITS THE DESK
THEY ARE IN BREACH OF MYPATENT.
AT WHICH POINT THEY GIVE MEMONEY.
AFTER THAT-- (APPLAUSE)
ONCE I GOT THE GREEN THENIT'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW
MANY GERBIL SHIRTS AM I GONNABUY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
