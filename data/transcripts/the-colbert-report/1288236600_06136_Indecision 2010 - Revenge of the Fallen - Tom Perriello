NOW, WHILE LIBERALS' FACES ARE
GETTING STEPPED ON IN KENTUCKY,
EVERYWHERE ELSE IT'S THEIR HOPES
AND DREAMS, SO IT'S TIME FOR YET
ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF MY
MID-TERM COVERAGE.
"INDECISION 2010: REVENGE OF THE
FALLEN."
>> DEMOCRATS ARE SUCH EASY PREY.
>> Stephen: NOW, TO SEE JUST
WHERE THE ELECTION STANDS RIGHT
NOW, LET'S BRING UP "THE COLBERT
REPORT'S" 2010 ELECTION MAP.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MY EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GOT IT AT A
DENNY'S.
WE BLEW MOST OF THE BUDGET ON
THE RALLY.
AS YOU CAN SEE, FROM ALL THE RED
UP HERE, THE REPUBLICANS ARE
DOING VERY WELL WITH PIRATES AND
PARROTS, BUT THEY'VE STILL GOT A
FEW OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME BEFORE
THEY REACH THEIR ULTIMATE PRIZE,
WHICH IS A CHESTFUL OF TACK CUTS
FOR THE TOP 2%.
BUT TO STOP THAT, DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATES ARE UNITING BEHIND
ONE INSPIRING MESSAGE -- I DON'T
KNOW WHO THIS PERSON IS 2010.
( LAUGHTER )
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN ADS.
>> WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
NANCY PELOSI PRESSURED CHET
EDWARDS, CHET STOOD UP TO THEM
AND VOTED NO AGAINST THEIR
TRILLION DOLLAR HEALTH CARE
BILL.
>> HE'S NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP
TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> AND NANCY PELOSI.
>> BILL OWENS DIDN'T VOTE WITH
NANCY PELOSI 93% OF THE TIME.
HE VOTED WITH THE REPUBLICAN
LEADER 63% OF THE TIME.
>> Stephen: THE LAST TIME I
SAW THAT MANY PEOPLE RUN AWAY
FROM THEIR PARTY IS WHEN I
CALLED SOME COPS ON SOME HIGH
SCHOOL KIDS.
( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THIS AD
FROM WEST VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT JOE
MANCHIN.
>> AS YOUR SENATOR, I'LL PROTECT
OUR SETTLEMENT RIGHTS.
THAT'S WHY THE N.R.A. ENDORSED
ME.
I'LL TAKE ON WASHINGTON AND THIS
ADMINISTRATION TO GET THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFF OF OUR
BACKS AND OUT OF OUR POCKETS.
I SUED E.P.A., AND I'LL TAKE
DEAD AIM AT THE CAP AND TRADE
BILL.
CAUSE IT'S BAD FOR WEST
VIRGINIA.
>> Stephen: IT SEEMS
EXCESSIVE.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT REMEMBER, IN WEST VIRGINIA,
THAT'S WHAT THEY USE FOR A WHOLE
PUNCH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, SOME DEMOCRATS CAN BRAG
THAT THEY STOOD AGAINST OBAMA ON
THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE OF ALL,
LIKE MISSISSIPPI DEMOCRAT GENE
TAYLOR, WHO LAST WEEKEND PROUDLY
ANNOUNCED THAT HE VOTED FOR JOHN
McCAIN.
THAT IS BRAVE.
IF ONLY MORE PEOPLE IN HIS
DISTRICT HAD FOLLOWED HIS LEAD,
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
REPRESENTED BY A GUTLESS
DEMOCRAT LIKE GENE TAYLOR.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW I'M GLAD, I AM GLAD...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I AM GLAD THE DEMOCRATS ARE
FINALLY SHOWING SOME SPINE, A
SPINE THAT CAN BEST BE SEEN AS
THEY RUN AWAY FROM THEIR RECORD.
IN FACT, I CANNOT THINK OF ONE
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN RUNNING
FOR REELECTION WHO HAS THE GUTS
TO STAND BY WHAT THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE ACHIEVED.
JOINING ME NOW WITH -- IS ONE
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN WHO HAS
THE GUTS THE STAND BY WHAT THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE ACHIEVED, TOM
PERRIELLO.
NOW, SIR, YOU'RE A RARE BREED.
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNING ON
THE DEMOCRATS' RECORDMENT WHY
ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT YOURSELF
LIKE THIS?
IS IT A CRY FOR HELP?
>> WELL, THERE'S ENOUGH PAIN OUT
THERE WITH OUR FAMILIES ALREADY,
BUT I THINK WE STEPPED UP WHEN
THE COUNTRY WAS IN CRISIS AND
SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW A
DEPRESSION TO HAPPEN ON OUR
WATCH.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER
PARTY THAT STEPS UP AND SAYS WE
CARE ABOUT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
AND THEN DOES NOTHING ABOUT IT.
I THINK PEOPLE ARE SMART ENOUGH
OUT THERE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
RESULTS TAKE TIME.
>> Stephen: CONGRESSMAN, YES,
RESULTS DO TAKE TIME, AND, YES,
WE WERE IN THE WORST ECONOMIC
DISASTER SINCE THE GREAT
DEPRESSION, BUT YOU'VE HAD
ALMOST 21 MONTHS.
WHY ISN'T IT BOOM TIME YET?
( LAUGHTER )
>> I THINK WE NEED PEOPLE WHO
ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND DO
THE RIGHT THING FOR THIS COUNTRY
AND FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.
WE HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF
FAMILIES STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW,
GETTING THEM BASIC UNEMPLOYMENT
BENEFITS, MAKING SURE THEY STILL
HAVE CHANCE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN
DREAM BECAUSE THEIR KIDS HAVE
DECENT TEACHERS IN THE
CLASSROOM.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THROWING
AROUND THESE ESOTERIC CONCEPTS
LIKE EDUCATION AND JOBS.
WHY NOT RUN ON A UNIVERSAL
MESSAGE -- MUSLIMS FREAK ME OUT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WHAT I
FIND WITH PEOPLE AT THE KITCHEN
TABLE IS THAT THEY REALLY DO
CARE ABOUT JOBS.
THEY CARE ABOUT NOT JUST THE
JOBS OF TODAY BUT THAT WE'RE
AHEAD OF THE JOBS OF TOMORROW.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, YOU...
WE KNOW THAT THIS WAS A
DO-NOTHING CONGRESS.
BUT YOU SEEM TO SAY THAT YOU GOT
SOMETHING DONE.
ISN'T THAT A MIXED MESSAGE TO
THE VOTERS?
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, WHAT WE'RE GOING OUT
AND DOING IS SHOWING WHAT WE'VE
DONE IN OUR DISTRICT.
WE HAVE DAIRY FARMERS AND
POULTRY FARMERS TURNING FARM
WASTE INTO POWER.
>> Stephen: CONGRESSMAN, YOU
SAY THAT THERE ARE POULTRY
FARMERS WHO ARE USING THEIR
ANIMALS' WASTE TO CREATE ENERGY?
WHAT IS THAT?
>> WE'RE USING AN AROBIC
DIGESTERS TO HEAT UP CHICKEN
WASTE.
WE'RE TAKING THOSE WASTE
PRODUCTS AND TURNING IT INTO
ENERGY.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
BOLD ENERGY INITIATIVE.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING
ON THAT SLOGAN, TOM PERIELLO:
CHICKEN [BLEEPED]?
>> WE MAY HAVE CONSIDERED IT,
BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY REJECTED.
>>
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUTH VOTE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT EDUCATION.
YOUR DISTRICT INCLUDES THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, TRUE?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Stephen: HOW IMPORTANT TO
YOU IS THE YOUTH VOTE TURNING
OUT THIS YEAR?
>> I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO SHOW UP,
WHETHER IT'S AT U.V.A. OR
LONGWOOD BECAUSE WHEN YOUNG
PEOPLE SHOW UP, YOUNG PEOPLE GET
LISTENED TO.
>> Stephen: WITH THAT IN MIND,
WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON
LEGALIZING MEDICAL MARIJUANA
BECAUSE FROM WHAT I REMEMBER
FROM U.V.A. IS THERE WERE A LOT
OF VERY ANXIOUS KIDS THERE WITH
TERRIBLE CASES OF GLAUCOMA.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE.
I THINK THE ANSWER ISN'T TO
BRANDER TO YOUNG PEOPLE, IT'S TO
DELIVER RESULTS.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU MET YOUNG
PEOPLE?
THEY LOVE BEING BRANDERED TO.
DON'T THEY?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CONGRESSMAN, GOOD LUCK NEXT
WEEK, SIR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
