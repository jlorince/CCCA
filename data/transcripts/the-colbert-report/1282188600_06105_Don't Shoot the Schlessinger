>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, IT SEEMS LIKE THESE DAYS
YOU CAN'T SWING A DEAD CAT
WITHOUT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITY GETTING UPSET THAT YOU
JUST HIT 'EM WITH A DEAD CAT.
[LAUGHTER]
CULTURE VICTIMIZATION, I SAY.
WELL, NOW, A FIRESTORM HAD
ERUPTED AROUND RADIOHOST LAURA
SCHLESINGER.
LAURA AND I HAVE PRETTY CLOSE.
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE
30-YEAR-OLD NAKED PHOTOS OF US
THAT LEAKED ON TO THE INTERNET A
FEW YEARS BACK.
WE WERE JUST VERY EXCITED THAT
JIMMY CARTER LOST THE
REELECTION.
NOW, SCHLESINGER IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE TOP CONSERVATIVE
LAURAS.
THERE'S LAURA BUSH.
LAURA INGRAHAM AND LAURA ROVE.
KARL ROVE'S FAMILY VALUES DRAG
PERSONA.
TRUST ME, AFTER AN AUDITORIUM
FULL OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS SEES
LAURA ROVE PERFORM, THEY WILL
NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX BEFORE
MARRIAGE OR AFTER A MEAL.
WHICH IS WHY I WAS SADDENED THAT
LAURA SCHLESINGER IS BEING
VILIFIED FOR SOME ADVICE SHE
GAVE A BLACK CALLER WHO BELIEVED
HER WHITE HUSBAND'S FRIENDS WERE
MAKING RACIST COMMENTS.
JIM.
>> CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF
A RACIST COMMENT BECAUSE
SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE
HYPERSENSITIVE.
>> HOW ABOUT THE "N" WORD?
THE "N" WORD HAS BEEN...
>> BLACK GUYS USE IT ALL THE
TIME.
TURN ON HBO.
LISTEN TO A BLACK COMIC AND ALL
YOU HEAR IS [BLEEPED],
[BLEEPED].
I DON'T GET IT.
IF ANYONE WITHOUT ENOUGH MEL
ANYONE SAYS IT, IT'S A HORRIBLE
THING.
>> I'M A LITTLE PUT OUT BY THE
"N" WORD.
I HOPE EVERYONE HEARD IT.
>> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.
[BLEEPED], [BLEEPED].
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME FINISH A
SENTENCE.
>> OKAY.
>> DON'T TAKE THINGS OUT OF
CONTEXT.
DON'T NAACP ME.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU'RE THAT
HYPERSENSITIVE ABOUT COLOR AND
DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR,
DON'T HARRY OUT OF YOUR RACE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY THOMAS
JEFFERSON DIDN'T MARRY SALLY
HEMMING, SHE NEVER LAUGHED AT
HIS SLAVE JOKES.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS INCIDENT IS ESPECIALLY
DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO LOSE MY RADIOSHOW
"COLBERT ON THE AIR."
AND BLACK PEOPLE'S
HYPERSENSITIVITY IS ALREADY A
MINEFIELD.
HERE'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE FROM
YESTERDAY'S SHOW.
ANYWAY, THAT'S HOW YOU CAN
LEGALLY SPAY YOUR CAT AT HOME.
JUST KEEP A FIRM GRIP.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT CALLER.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
>> HI, STEPHEN, I HAVE A
QUESTION ABOUT USED CARS.
>> Stephen: SHOOT.
>> I'M LOOKING TO BUY A HONDA
ACCORD WITH 100,000 MILES ON IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
FIRST QUESTION, ARE YOU BLACK?
I DON'T SEE RACE.
I DON'T HEAR RACE.
I KNOW YOU PEOPLE HAVE A SHORT
FUSE.
>> CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE
CAR?
>> Stephen: HOW BLACK ARE YOU?
IF YOU WERE A PAINT SWATCH,
WOULD YOU BE MORE LIKE RAW UM
BER OR CINIBAR.
>> I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE
UNCOMFORTABLE?
I HAVE TO WATCH THE RACE CAR.
GET A JOB, CINIBAR.
>> I HAVE A JOB.
DON'T CALL ME CINIBAR.
>> IF I HAVE AN S.P.F. MORE THAN
25, I'M A RACIST?
WELCOME TO OBAMA'S AMERICA.
NEXT CALLER.
HELLO.
ARE YOU PUERTO RICAN?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TURNS OUT THE NEXT CALLER WAS
NOT PUERTO RICAN.
HE WAS THE F.C.C.
ANYWAY, DR. LAURA'S SHOW HAS
LOST TWO MAJOR SPONSORS SO SHE
DROPPED THIS BOMB ON LARRY KING.
>> I MADE THE DECISION NOT TO DO
RADIO ANYMORE.
>> Stephen: I ASSUME BECAUSE
SHE WANTS TO SPEND MORE TIME
SAYING THE "N" WORD WITH HER
FAMILY.
TURNS OUT SHE HAS AN EVEN BETTER
REASON.
>> THE REASON IS I WANT TO
REGAIN MY FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHTS.
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT'S
ON MY MIND AND IN MY HEART AND
WHAT I THINK IS HELPFUL AND
USEFUL WITHOUT SOMEBODY GETTING
ANGRY, SOME SPECIAL INTEREST
GROUP DECIDING THIS IS A TIME TO
SILENCE A VOICE OF DISSENT AND
ATTACK AFFILIATES AND ATTACK
SPONSORS.
>> Stephen: GOOD FOR YOU,
LAWYER RAMP THE FIRST AMENDMENT
GUARANTEES ALL AMERICANS THE
RIGHT TO SAY WHAT WE WANT ON THE
AIR NO MATTER HOW OFFENSIVE
WITHOUT HAVING OUR SPONSORS DROP
US LIKE THE CLOTHES OFF LAURA
SCHLESINGER IN THE LATE 1970s.
[LAUGHTER]
SO TONIGHT IN SOLIDARITY WITH
DR. LAURA, I WOULD LIKE THE SAY
THIS.
BELGIANS ARE A FILTHY, THEEFG
PEOPLE.
