(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE
"REPORT," EVERYBODY.
BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANT TO
WELCOME TWO NEW MEMBERS OF THE
COLBERT NATION.
GABRIELA BORN TO MY PRODUCER
TANYA.
LIKE EVERYTHING TANYA PRODUCES,
GABRIELA WAS BORN ON TIME AND
UNDER BUDGET.
(LAUGHTER)
AND NOT TO BE OUTDONE, WE ALSO
WELCOME GREGORY, BORN TO MY
AUDIENCE COORDINATOR STUART.
YES, AFTER NINE MONTHS OF
WAITING, HE IS FINALLY HERE
WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SAME
AMOUNT OF TIME MY AUDIENCE WAITS
BEFORE EACH SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
ALTHOUGH OUR AUDIENCE HOLDING
AREA IS MORE CRAMPED THAN A
WOMB.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE
MULTIPLE STAFFERS OUT AT ONCE SO
TO AVOID ANY FUTURE OVERLAP I AM
DISTRIBUTING A DETAILED STAFF
PROCREATION SCHEDULE.
LEN, IT'S YOUR NIGHT TO MAKE A
BABY.
