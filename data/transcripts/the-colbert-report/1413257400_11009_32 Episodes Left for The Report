>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY!
FOLKS, THERE ARE SO MANYIMPORTANT STORIES OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW -- I.S.I.S., UKRAINE,EBOLA.
TONIGHT WE EXPLORE THE MOSTCRITICAL STORY OF ALL -- ME.
BACK IN 2005 WHEN I STARTED "THECOLBERT REPORT," IT WAS FOR AN
INITIALLY FOR AN EIGHT-WEEKTRYOUT.
IN OTHER WORDS, 32 EPISODES.
AND AS OF TONIGHT, THERE AREONLY 32 EPISODES OF THE "THE
COLBERT REPORT" LEFT.
(AUDIENCE AWWW'S)DON'T WORRY, NATION.
EVEN THOUGH MY SHOW WILL BE OFFTHE AIR, I'LL STILL BE IN HERE
PROVIDED YOUR HEART HAS A D.V.R.
(LAUGHTER)THERE'S JUST NOTHING LEFT FOR ME
TO ACCOMPLISH.
I PROMISED I WOULD CHANGE THEWORLD, AND I DID -- AFTER ALL,
IN 2005 YOU DIDN'T HAVE IGGYAZELIA, SNAPCHAT OR AMERICONE
DREAM ICE CREAM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I FREED YOU FROM THE TYRANNY OF
HAVING TO FUDGE-COAT YOUR OWNCHUNKS OF WAFFLECONE.
THAT SAVES TIME.
TIME YOU CAN SPEND WITH YOURFAMILY.
MM-MMM!
EVEN THE LID TASTES GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)BY THE WAY, I MAY BE LEAVING,
BUT THE ICE CREAM IS GOING TOSTAY.
YET ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN KEEP MEIN HERE.
'CUZ THIS IS GONNA GUM UP YOURAORTA.
(LAUGHTER)AND I GUARANTEE THAT EACH OF THE
REMAINING EPISODES WILL BECOMEINSTANT CLASSICS, TREASURED BY
GENERATIONS FOR THEIR DEEP,POETIC THOUGHTS, HEAVY-HANDED
SYMBOLISM, AND MASSIVEFORESHADOWING.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GRIMMY?
(LAUGHTER)(AUDIENCE REACTS)
HMM...
WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE BY FIRE, YOU'RE
POINTING AT AN HOURGLASS -- OOH,STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE!
(LAUGHTER)YOU LIKE MY PAINTING, AND
YOUR NECK IS ITCHY.
(LAUGHTER)SKULL AND CROSSBONES...
THEY'RE MAKING "PIRATES OF THECARIBBEAN 32!"
(APPLAUSE)OF COURSE, THE BIGGEST QUESTION
OF ALL REMAINS, HOW WILL MYFINAL BROADCAST CLOSE?
WILL I WAKE UP NEXT TOSUZANNE PLESHETTE IN A SNOW
GLOBE AFTER RACHEL GETS OFF THEPLANE TO BE WITH ME WHILE B.J.
HONEYCUTT WRITES OUT GOODBYE INROCKS, UNTIL WE CUT TO BLACK IN
THE MIDDLE OF A JOURNEY SONG?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)OR WILL I JUST GET SUED FOR
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT?
TUNE IN TO FIND OUT!
BUT REST ASSURED, NATION, UPUNTIL THE VERY END, I WILL
MAINTAIN MY JOURNALISTICSTANDARDS BY BRINGING YOU MY
TAKE ON THE STORIES THAT MATTERTO YOU.
SO LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO THEBREAKING NEWS OUT OF
SOUTH KOREA.
A CHIHUAHUA IS READING AMAGAZINE WHILE GETTING A NECK
MASSAGE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
