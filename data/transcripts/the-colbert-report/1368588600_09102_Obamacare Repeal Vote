>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME IN
HERE, OUT THERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, FOLKS,
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
YOU KNOW, NATION, THERE'S
BIG NEWS WE HAVE GOT TO GET
TO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS
SHOW THEN YOU KNOW THAT FOR
YEARS NOW JOURNALISTS LIKE
ME HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET
ANYTHING TO STICK TO TEFLONA
OBAMA.
WELL, NO MORE, FOLKS.
BECAUSE EVERY DAY THIS WEEK
BRINGS A NEW SCANDAL FOR HIS
ADMINISTRATION.
AND MI SO DISAPPOINTED THAT
THE WEEK HAS ONLY 7 DAYS.
(LAUGHTER)
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THESE
SCANDALS FOR ABOUT THREE
YEARS I'M GUESSING.
(LAUGHTER)
IN THE MEANTIME THIS
THURSDAY THE HOUSE WILL HOLD
AN HISTORIC VOTE.
>> HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN
BOEHNER ANNOUNCED THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL VOTE
ONCE AGAIN NEXT WEEK TO
REPEAL OBAMACARE.
>> THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED
HOUSE PLANS TO VOTE NEXT
WEEK TO REPEAL THE
PRESIDENT'S PLAN FOR THE
37th TIME.
>> Stephen: YES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOR THE 37th
TIME.
37, OF COURSE, IS A PRIME
NUMBER.
MEANING IT CAN BE DIVIDED
ONLY BY VICIOUS PARTISANSHIP.
PLAV--
(LAUGHTER)
AND HOUSE SPEAKER AND GOOD
SOURCE OF BETA CAROTENE JOHN
BOEHNER IS HOLDING THIS
PARTICULAR VOTE FOR THE BEST
POSSIBLE REASONS.
>> WE'VE GOT 70 NEW MEMBERS
THAT HAVE NOT HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THE
PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW.
>> ITS GUYS HAVE BEEN UP
HERE LAST YEAR, UP HERE, WE
CAN GO HOME AND SAY LISTEN,
WE VOTED 36 DIFFERENT TIMES
TO REPEAL OR REPLACE
OBAMACARE.
TELL ME WHAT THE NEW GUYS
ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY.
>> Stephen: YEAH!
COME ON, MOM!
THE OLDER CONGRESS GOT TO
VOTE AGAINST OBAMACARE.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE HOLLOW
PARTISANSHIP.
WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL MY
FRIENDS?
I HATE YOU!
IT'S NOT JUST OBAMACARE,
FOLKS.
THEY SHOULD GET TO DO ALL
THE GOOD VOTES THEY WEREN'T
THERE FOR.
REPEALING PROHIBITION,
DECLARING WAR ON JAPAN,
CALLING ON AMERICA TO PUT A
MAN ON THE MOON BY THE END
OF 40 YEARS AGO.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT OF COURSE LIBERALS ARE
OUT THERE TRYING TO ROB THIS
EMPTY GESTURE OF ITS DEEP
MEANING.
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN.
THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF
TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
>> I THINK IT'S A HUGE WASTE
OF TIME.
>> THIS REPEAL VOTE IS A
WASTE OF TIME AND TAX
DOLLARS.
>> Stephen: OH.
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND
TAX DOLLARS, DEMOCRATS.
WELL, I'VE GOT ANOTHER BILL
FOR YOU TO VOTE ON RIGHT
HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, OH, OH, WAIT, I HAVE AN
AMENDMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I AM TELLING YOU, FOLKS, THE
DONKEY CROWD JUST DON'T GET
IT EVERY OBAMACARE REPEAL IS
UNIQUE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS
NEVER PLAY THIS ISSUE THE
SAME WAY TWICE.
AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE GOT
EVERY OBAMACARE REPEAL VOTE
ON BOOTLEG.
I TRADE TAPES WITH ALL THE
OTHER FANS.
WE CALL OURSELVES DEADHEADS
BECAUSE WITHOUT HEALTH
