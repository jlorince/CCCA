HE LOOKS GOOD.
NATION, IF THERE'S ONE THING THE REELECTION OF BARACK OBAMA PROVED, IT'S THAT DEMOGRAPHIC
SHIFTS ARE MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE GOP TO WIN NATIONALLY.
APPARENTLY IN 2012, MINORITY VOTERS JUST DIDN'T CONNECT WITH THE REPUBLICAN MESSAGE OF
"STOP THIEF!"
[LAUGHTER]
THE MAN BEHIND OBAMA'S MINORITY OUTREACHAROUND WAS JEREMY BIRD,�i
[LAUGHTER]
WHO FOCUSED ON FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION WITH CORE OBAMA SUPPORT GROUPS, NONWHITES
UNMARRIED WOMEN, AND MILLENNIALS.
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MUCH MILLENNIALS LOVE TWO FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, NOW BIRD HAS SET HIS SIGHTS ON A NEW TARGET.
>> TEAM OBAMA'S FORMER NATIONAL FIELD DIRECTOR JEREMY BIRD, ONE OF THE MASTERMINDS BEHIND THE
PRESIDENT'S REELECTION VICTORY HAS DECIDED HIS NEXT JOB WILL BE TURNING TEXAS BLUE WITH A NEW
GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION BATTLEGROUND TEXAS.
>> YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BATTLEGROUND STATES.
ALTHOUGH THAT'S GON' BE CHANGING SOON.�r
>> Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S 'GON' BE CHANGING EVEN FASTER THAN OBAMA'S ACCENT!
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, THIS MEANS THE DEMOCRATS ARE MESSING WITH TEXAS!
A, I BELIEVE THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND B, I BELIEVE IT MIGHT WORK.
>> TEXAS IS ONE OF FOUR MAJORITY MINORITY STATES, AND ITS 9.5 MILLION HISPANICS, CURRENTLY 38%
OF THE POPULATION.
>> JUST 4.1 MILLION HISPANICS ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, AND ONLY ABOUT HALF MAKE IT INTO THE
VOTING BOOTH.
>> Stephen: WHICH MEANS IF JEREMY BIRD CAN GET THESE MINORITIES TO THE POLLS
TEXAS REPUBLICANS MAY SOON BE SAYING THE SPANISH WORD FOR "ADIOS."
[LAUGHTER]
SO CAN THIS JEREMY BIRD CHARACTER ENACT HIS SINISTER PLAN TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION
THROUGH THE DIRTY, UNDERHANDED TRICK OF VOTING?
[LAUGHTER]
HERE TO TELL ME IS THE FIELD DIRECTOR OF OBAMA 2012 AND THE FOUNDER OF BATTLEGROUND TEXAS
JEREMY BIRD.
JEREMY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, JEREMY, LET'S TALK TURKEY FOR A SECOND.
HOW MUCH OF THIS IS BLUSTER?
CAN YOU REALLY�i FLIP TEXAS?
BECAUSE THERE'S A DAMN GOOD CHANCE BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION THEY WILL --
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY MORE THAN BLUSTER.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS IT'S THE STATE THAT IS CHANGING.
THE COUNTRY IS CHANGING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN CHANGING?
>> A MORE DIVERSE STATE.
IT'S BECOMING A LOT MORE YOUNG PEOPLE.
WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND EXPAND THE ELECTORATE.
GET THE NEW VOTERS, REGISTER THEM, BRING THEM INTO THE PROCESS.
THE FOLKS REGISTERED TO VOTE AND NOT TURNING OUT IN TEXAS WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A GRASSROOTS
CAMPAIGN AND TURN IT INTO A COMPETITIVE BATTLEGROUND STATE.
>> Stephen: IF YOU DO THAT, THAT WILL UPSET THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS.
WE KNOW IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT OHIO AND FLORIDA GET TO PICK THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION?
>> IN TEXAS IF YOU GO THERE AND TALK TO VOLUNTEERS.
I'VE SEEN THE�� VOLUNTEERS WHETHER IT'S IN EL PASO DRIVING UP TOWARDS NEW MEXICO OR CALLING
DOWN THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON TEXAS.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE FIGHT TO TEXAS AND MAKE THE A BATTLEGROUND STATE SO THAT
ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THEY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR TEXAS.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS ARE HAPPENING?
THAT'S JUST LIBERAL YOU'VE MIXES FOR HISPANICS AND BLACK PEOPLE D YOU'VE MS.IMS DEUPHEMISMS FOR
HISPANICS AND BLACK PEOPLE.
IF YOU LOOK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS IT'S THE TURNOUT.
ONLY 54% OF THE LATINOS WERE REGISTERED TO VOTE AND ONLY 35% TURNED OUT.
WITH ONLY 50% OF A POPULATION TURNS OUT TO VOTE YOU GET A GOVERNMENT IN TEXAS.
IT FOR HALF THE PEOPLE AND BY HALF THE PEOPLE.
WE PLAN TO CHANGE THAT IT'S NOT THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IN THE FUTURE IT'S THE FOLKS THERE IN
THE FUTURE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE REACHING TOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS?
>> OF COURSE, AND YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN, ACROSS THE STATE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE A RACIST.
>> WHAT I WANT TO DO IN TEXAS IS MAKE THE PEOPLE THERE PART OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
GET EVERYBODY IN THE STATE TO TURN OUT AND VOTE SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT REFLECTS THE PEOPLE
OF TEXAS.
>> Stephen: IS VOTER I.D.
GOING TO STOP YOU.
RICK PERRY BEHIND THE VOTER I.D.
LAW, ISN'T HE?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE THE WAY REPUBLICANS HAVE GERRYMANNEDERED IT.
>> Stephen: IT'S AN UGLY WORD.
IT'S EXTREMELY ACCURATE BUT UGLY WORD.
>> THE LAWS THEY PUT IN PLACE MAKE IT HARD TO VOTE.
WE'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE, FIGHT TOUR THEIR VOTING RIGHTS AND TURN THEM OUT IN FORCE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A BET?
$100?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I BET YOU $100 YOU CANNOT GET BARACK OBAMA REELECTED IN 2016.
JEREMY BIRD,
