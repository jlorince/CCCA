EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK,
"ROCK THE CASBAH: RAGE AND
REBELLION ACROSS THE ISLAMIC
WORLD."
FORGET THE ISLAMIC WORLD, I BET
THE CLASH IS PISSED.
PLEASE WELCOME ROBIN WRIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
HEY, MS. WRIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
WELCOME BACK.
NOW, YOU SAY "RAGE AND REBELLION
IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD."
IS THAT A GOOD THING THAT THEY
ARE RAGING AND REBELLED BECAUSE
AREN'T WE ONE OF THE THINGS
THEY'RE RAGING AND
REBELLED,
EVEN CONDI, LATASHA DOES THE UNITED
STATES BENEFIT FROM THIS RAGE
AND REBELLION?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HAPPENING A LONG TIME AGO.
WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTING A LOT OF
THE AUTOCRATS IN THE REGION.
IN ORDER TO WIN THE WAR ON
TERRORISM, IT'S IMPORTANT WE GET
MUSLIM PEOPLE BEHIND US, MUSLIM
PEOPLE ON THE STREETS TAKING
INITIATIVE.
>> Stephen: BUT WE ALREADY DID
THAT BY INVADING IRAQ AND
GETTING RID OF SADDAM HUSSEIN.
>> AND THAT WENT SO WELL.
>> Stephen: WELL, WE WON.
WE WON THERE.
WE WENT IN THERE.
WE GOT RID OF THE BAD GUY,
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE SADDAM BACK.
JUST GO AHEAD AND SAY IT.
YOU WANT SADDAM BACK.
>> NEW YORK BUT...
>> Stephen: OKAY.
GOOD.
THEN THEY SHOULD BE THANKING US.
DIDN'T WE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE
ARAB WORLD THAT THIS IS HOW YOU
CHANGE THINGS, AND THEY WENT,
JESUS, WE COULD DO THAT
OURSELVES, EXCEPT MINUS THE
JESUS PART.
>> THEY ACTUALLY DID.
>> Stephen: DID THEY REALLY?
>> NO.
IN FACT, THEY WERE REJECTING THE
MODEL WE ESTABLISHED IN BOTH
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
IT DIDN'T WORKMENT TEN YEARS
LATER WE'RE STILL IN BOTH
COUNTRIES.
TEN YEARS LATER THERE ARE MORE
SUICIDE BOMBERS IN IRAQ THAN WE
HAVE EVER SUFFERED FROM.
GREATER DEATHS IN AFGHANISTAN
LAST MONTH THAN AT ANY TIME
SINCE WE WENT INCH THE
EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT'S
HAPPENING IN THE REGION IS THE
MUSLIMS ARE TAKING PROACTIVE
STEPS TO CHALLENGE EXTREMISM TO,
CHALLENGE AUTOCRATS AND CREATE A
WHOLE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT IN
THE REGION.
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE
UNABLE TO DO OURSELVES.
WE'RE GREAT AS A MILITARY
FIGHTING EXTREMISTS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT
GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY IS ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT PROJECTING POWER INTO
AN AREA OF THE WORLD AND THEN,
YOU KNOW, SHAKING [BLEEPED] UP.
YOU DON'T THINK THAT WE IN ANY
WAY HELPED CHANGE THE EQUATION
IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH THE
ACTIONS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS?
>> IT WAS NOT WHAT WE DID.
IT WAS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
REJECTED THE EXTREMISM BY AL
QAEDA, BY OSAMA BIN LADEN.
THEY PAID A FAR GREATER PRICE
THAN WE DID.
IT WAS THEIR REJECTION OF
EXTREMISM THAT'S REALLY TURNED
THE SITUATION AROUND IN THE
REGION, AND IT'S CREATED A
DIFFERENT KIND OF CULTURE,
CREATED PLAYWRIGHTS AND POETS
AND RAPPERS WHO ARE ALL
CHALLENGING REGIMES IN A WAY
THAT WE CAN'T DO WITH ANY
CREDIBILITY.
GUNS ALONE ARE NOT GOING TO
CHANGE THE REALITY ON THE GROUND
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT GUNS
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
OKAY.
WE'RE TEN YEARS AFTER 9/11.
OSAMA BIN LADEN DEAD.
SADDAM HUSSEIN DEAD.
ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI DEAD.
KHALID SHAKE MOHAMED IN CUSTODY.
PETREAUS DOESN'T NEED TO BE OUT
THERE ANYMORE.
HOWEVER YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THIS
MIGHT HAVE POLITICALLY AFFECTED
THINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HOW
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY
THE MAN ON THE STREET, WE HAVE
WON THE WAR ON TERROR.
>> NOT YET.
>> Stephen: WELL, WE ARE
WINNING.
WE ARE WINNING THEN.
>> ARE WE WINNING, OR ARE THE
PEOPLE IN THE REGION WINNING?
>> Stephen: WE ARE WINNING
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WAGE THE
WAR.
IT'S OUR WAR, WE WAGED THE WAR.
WE GOT ALL THESE GUYS, AND YOU
SAY THAT AL QAEDA IS... IS AL
QAEDA ALL BUSTED UP?
>> NO AL QAEDA IS STILL A
THREAT, BUT IT'S INCREASINGLY
PASSE.
>> Stephen: PASSE?
>> PASSE.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE NOT A PAIR
OF JEANS.
THEY'RE A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION
THAT IS OUT TO DESTROY THE
UNITED STATES.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PASSE?
THEY DON'T HAVE SUPPORT ANYMORE?
>> IN EGYPT, A BUNCH OF KIDS GOT
OUT ON THE STREETS AND DID AN --
IN 18 DAYS WHAT OSAMA BIN LADEN
AND HIS FORMER NUMBER TWO, NOW
NUMBER ONE, AN EGYPTIAN,
COULDN'T DO IN 30 YEARS.
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT.
THERE'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT TYPE
OF ACTIVISM, WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY
OF DOING THINGS.
A REJECTION OF EXTREMIST TACTICS
AND VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT'S THE
KIND OF GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY WE
ENGAGE IN OR THE EXTREMISM OF AL
QAEDA.
>> Stephen: YOU MAKE AN EGIVE
LANDS OF GUNBOAT EXTREME SI
AND...
>> NEITHER ONE CAN WIN.
>> Stephen: TEN YEARS AGO ON
THAT TERRIBLE DAY, SOME PEOPLE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE DANCING
IN THE STREETS AFTER THE FALL OF
THE TALIBAN.
WOULD THAT HAPPEN AGAIN TODAY?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT, BUT I DON'T
THINK THAT WAS THE MAJORITY OF
PEOPLE IN THE REGION.
>> Stephen: SOME PEOPLE WERE.
PEOPLE WERE SELL SECRETARY OF
STATE BREATHING THE VICTORY
OF -- CELEBRATING THE VICTORY OF
AL QAEDA.
>> YOU CAN'T STEREOTYPE 1.5
MILLION PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: OH, YES, I CAN,
THEY'RE DANGEROUS AND THEY MAKE
VERY POOR AMERICANS.
>> NOT TRUE.
BUT SINCE 2007, THERE HAS BEEN
SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF
CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE REGION,
WE'RE REALLY WITNESSING THE
BEGINNING OF THE BEGINNING OF
SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.
AND IT PLAYS OUT IN THE UPRISING
ON THE STREET.
IT PLAYS OUT IN THE CULTURE THAT
IS GIVING A DIFFERENT VOICE.
AND WE'RE SEEING WHAT IS LIKELY
TO BE... THIS IS THE MOST EPIC
CONVULSION AND THE MOST
POLITICAL, IMPORTANT POLITICAL
TURNING POINT OF THE EARLY
21st CENTURY.
>> ARE MUSLIMS... THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION IS BECAUSE I
NEED TO KNOW WHO TO STAY MAD AT,
ARE MUSLIMS STILL OUR ENEMY?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IS WHO IS NEXT?
LUTHERANS?
I'M READY TO JACK GARRISON
KEELER TOMORROW.
IF IT'S NOT MUSLIMS, IF IT'S NOT
MUSLIM, WHO IS IT?
>> WELL, LOOK, EXTREMISM IS
ALWAYS GOING TO BE OUR ENEMY, NO
MATTER WHO ENGAGES IN IT, AND
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT
EXTREMISTS AROUND THE WORLD.
OUR GREATEST CHALLENGE TODAY IS
ACTUALLY ECONOMIC AND THE FORCES
THAT ARE CHALLENGING, WHETHER
IT'S OUR INABILITY TO DEAL WITH
DEBT ISSUES, WHETHER IT'S OUR
INABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE BECAUSE
THERE IS NO SENSE OF A FUTURE.
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE REALLY
VULNERABLE.
>> SO YOU SAY DEBT COULD BE OUR
BIGGEST ENEMY?
>> WELL, I THINK IT COULD DERAIL
A LOT OF IT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE
WANT IN TERMS OF CREATING A
DIFFERENT KIND OF POLITICAL
REALITY, AS WELL.
>>
>> Stephen: SHOULD WE BE
INVADING VISA?
>> NOT A BAD IDEA.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ROBIN WRIGHT, THE BOOK IS "ROCK
THE CASBAH."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
