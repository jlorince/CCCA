[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
ALL RIGHT.
FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR COMING.
FOLKS, THE SUPREME COURT
DELIVERED A LANDMARK RULING
YESTERDAY WITH FAR-REACHING
CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR PRIVACY,
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,
AND -- I'M SORRY.
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE IMPORTANT I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT.
IT'S THAT NEW SUPERMAN MOVIE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I HAVE NOT SEEN IT.
AND   DO NOT LIKE WHAT I HAVE
NOT SEEN.
FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN WARNING YOU
ABOUT THE MAN OF STEEL FOR TWO
YEARS NOW.
ABOUT THE WAY IT'S LIBERAL
INDOCTRINATION ABOUT HOPE AND
CHANGE AND THE SCANDAL THAT THE
GUY PLAYING SUPERMAN IS ENGLISH.
EXCUSE ME, ENGLISH.
SUPERMAN IS AN AMERICAN FROM
KRYPTON.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
READ YOUR CONSTITUTION.
EVEN WORSE, FOLKS, THIS HENRY
CAVILL GUY LOOKS ALMOST EXACTLY
LIKE THE GUY THEY CAST TO PLAY
CLARK KENT.
II'S GOING TO CONFUSE THE
AUDIENCE.
THINK.
AND TODAY, TODAY I SAW SOMETHING
THAT REALLY CROSSED THE LINE.
BY THAT, I MEAN THE VISIBLE
PANTY LINE.
SUPERMAN IS NOT WEARING HIS
TRADITIONAL RED UNDERWEAR.
THIS IS DISGUSTING.
YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE OUTLINE
OF HIS, SHALL WE SAY, FORTRESS
OF SOLITUDE.
COME ON!
( APPLAUSE )
-pI'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, IF
YOU LOOK CLOSELY IT DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK LIKE HE'S WEARING UNDERWEAR
INSIDE HIS TIGHTS WHICH COULD BEE3
TROUBLE BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,
OUR EARTH TALC HAS NO EFFECT ON
HIM.
I MEAN LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HE'S JUST BLUE, BLUE, BLUE, HEAD
TO TOE.
IT'S LIKE WEARING A DENIM JACKET
WITH DENIM JEANS WHICH EVERYONE
KNOWS GOT AQUAMAN KICKED OUT OF
THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.
THE RED UNDERWEAR, FOLKS, THE
RED UNDERWEAR IS A CRUCIAL PART
OF SUPERMAN'S COSTUME.
EVERY SUPERMAN HAS WORN THEM
STARTING WITH GEORGE REEVES AND
HIS BELTED GRANNY PANTIES.
THAT'S HOW WE WORE UNDERWEAR IN
THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION.
IT WAS BEFORE ELASTIC WAS
INVENTED.
AND LISTEN TO THE LAME EXCUSE
SCREEN WRITER DAN GOYER GIVES
FOR CREATING THE COMMANDO OF
STEEL.
>> OUR APPROACH WAS NOT A COMIC
BOOKKSUPERMAN.
IT WAS JUST TO DO A MORE
REALISTIC SUPEEMAN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
A MORE REALISTIC SUPERMAN
pECAUSE WHEN YOUR HERO IS A
FLYING MAN FROM ANOTHER PLANET
WHO CAN CRUSH COAL INTO DIAMONDS
AND MELT TITANIUM WITH HIS HEAT
VISION, YOU DON'T WANT HIM DOING
SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE LIKE
UNDERWEAR.
I MEAN, GREAT
