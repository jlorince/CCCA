FOLKS, WHAT A HAPPY,WONDERFUL, ATTRACTIVE GROUP
OF PEOPLE.
FOLKS, SOME PEOPLE SEE THEGRASS AS HALF EMPTY.
I SEE THE GRASS AS HALFFULL.
OF URINE, UNFORTUNATELY.
BUT THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT,WAG OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU
KNOW THERE IS NOTHING MOREIMPORTANT THAN A QUALITY
EDUCATION.
EXCEPT PERHAPS A QUANTITYEDUCATION WHICH IS DR.I WENT
TO THE 6th GRADE THREE TIMESIN A ROW.
HANG IN THERE, BUDDY, ITGETS BETTER.
NOW I'M NO FAN OF THEDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT
I DO LIKE THEIR NEW COMMONCORE STANDARDS.
>> WHICH ARE GOING TO BELESS EMPHASIS ON READING
LITERATURE AND MORE ONREADING MEMOS AND
INSTRUCTION MANUALS.
SO I WAS READY TO GIVE THECOMMON CORE AN F FOR
FANTASTIC.
THEN I SAW SOMETHING THATMADE ME CHANGE THAT TO AN A
FOR ANGRY.
JIM?
>> 45 STATES ADOPTING THEOBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S
COMMON CORE CURRICULUM WHICHDOES NOT REQUIRE THAT
CURSIVE BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL.
>> THERE ARE MANY CHILDRENTODAY WHO CAN'T EVEN READ
CURSIVE WRITING LET ALONEWRITE IT.
>> Stephen: WRITTEN OFF.
>> CURSIVE WRITING IS NOLONGER PART OF WHAT IS
CALLED QUOTE, UNQUOTE, THECOMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS.
THIS MEANS THAT CURSIVE ISNO LONGER CONSIDERED A CORE
SKILL THAT YOUNGSTERS MUSTLEARN.
>> Stephen: NATION, THATCRANKY RAISIN IS RIGHT.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ISWAGING A WAR ON CURSIVE, OR
POSSIBLY A WAYNE ON LURSIVE,IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL.
DIDN'T QUITE FINISH THATTHERE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIGTIP OF THE HAT TO THE
PENMANSHIP PATRIOTS OVER ATTHE CAMPAIGN FOR CURSIVE
WHOSE LOGO IS, NATURALLY, ADISEMBODIED HUMAN BRAIN WITH
EYES AND A MOUTH GIVING ATHUMBS UP SAYING CURSIVE IS
COOL.
IT IS EASY TO REMEMBERBECAUSE IT WILL HAUNT YOUR
DREAMS.
AS HANDWRITING TEACHER JANOLSON POINTS OUT THERE ARE
PLENTY OF REASONS TO KEEPCURSIVE AROUND.
>> CURSIVE IS THE FLUIDSTYLE OF WRITING.
THE CONNECTIONS MAKES THELETTERS FLOW TOGETHER AND IT
IS ACTUALLY FASTER FORSTUDENTS TO WRITE AND GET
THEIR THOUGHTS DOWN ONPAPER.
>> Stephen: YES, IT IS SOMUCH FASTER.
I MEAN LOOK HOW QUICKLY THATCHILD WROTE A-R.
SHE-- THINK ABOUT IT.
THAT WAS LIKE-- 11 SECONDS.
AND NOW SHE'S ALMOST A THIRDOF THE WAY THROUGH ARDUOUS.
(LAUGHTER)PLUS AS MASTER PENMAN
MICHAEL SULL EXPLAINSCURSIVE CONNECTS KID TO OUR
NATION'S HISTORY SAYING THEYWON'T BE ABLE TO READ THE
CONSTITUTION, THEDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
OR ANYTHING WRITTEN DURINGTHE CIVIL WAR.
GREAT, NOW THOSE NATIONALTREASURE MOVIES WON'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.
SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,CAMPAIGN FOR CURSIVE.
AND BE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT,IMPARTIAL AND COMPLETELY
OBJECTIVE GROUP BEHIND THECAMPAIGN, THE AMERICAN
HANDWRITING ANALYSISFOUNDATION WHOSE LOGO, AS
YOU CAN SEE, IS NOT INCURSIVE.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE ALREADYLOST, FOLKS.
THE HANDWRITING'S ON THEWALL.
AND NO ONE CAN READ IT.
NEXT UP ON THE TIP WAG, WAG,WAG, I'M TIRED OF
CONSERVATIVES BEING ACCUSEDOF BEING INSENSITIVE TO
BLACK PEOPLE.
WE GET IT.
NOW I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW OVERTHIS BREAK I WATCHED ALL OF
ROOTS PERFORMING ON JIMMYFALLON.
REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THECRUELTY OF JIMMY FALLON.
WELL, FOLKS, ON SUNDAYREPUBLICANS PROVED ONCE AND
FOR ALL THAT THEY ARESENSITIVE TO THE BLACK
EXPERIENCE BY COMMEMORATINGTHE 58th ANNIVERSARY OF ROSA
PARK'S COURAGEOUS BUSPROTEST.
THE RNC TOOK TO TWITTERSAYING TODAY WE REMEMBER
ROSA PARK'S BOLD STAND ANDHER ROLE IN ENDING RACISM.
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU ARETHINKING.
S THIS'S NOT RIGHT.
IT WAS REALLY MORE OF A BOLDSIT.
FOLKS, I'VE NEVER BEEN A FANOF ROSA PARKS.
I DON'T GET WHAT THE BIGDEAL IS I REFUSE TO GIVE UP
MY SEAT ALL THE TIME.
I DON'T STAND UP FORPREGNANT WOMEN, THE ELDERLY
OR EVEN FOR ROSA PARKS.
I STOLE HER SEAT AT ABENEFIT TO SIT CLOSER TO
OPRAH.
I SAY YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSEROSIE.
I-- (APPLAUSE)
I DON'T WANT TO TOOT MY OWNHORN BUT I AM THE ROSA PARKS
OF NOT GIVING UP MY SEAT FORROSA PARKS.
NEVERTHELESS, I AM GIVING ATIP OF THE HAT TO THE RNC
FOR REMINDING EVERYONE THATROSA PARKS ENDED RACISM.
THE MOMENT SHE REFUSED TOGET UP FROM HER SEAT IN
DECEMBER OF 1955 RACISM WASOVER.
THE END FADE TO BLACK.
OR FADE TO CHINESE,WHATEVER.
IT'S ALL THE SAME NOW.
SO BRAVO, RNC, FOR FINALLYGIVING PROPER CREDIT TO ROSA
PARKS.
AND IF ANYONE OUT THERE DOESNOT AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES
IT, THEN YOU'RE A RACISTWHICH YOU CANNOT BE THANKS
TO ROSA PARKS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
