ALL A CHANCE TO OWN A PIECE OFHISTORY.

OBAMA ARE BEING AUCTIONED OFF.
NICE UNIQUE HISTORICAL ITEM.
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL.
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF A KIND.

(AUDIENCE REACTS)NOW, I KNOW THAT'S A LOT OF
MONEY BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE ABEAUTIFUL REPLICA OF THE SIGNED
NOTES IT CAN BE YOURS FOR A $20DONATION TO THE FISHER HOUSE.
>> Stephen: YES, IN ANHISTORIC MOVE BILL'S

EVIDENCE OF BILL'S METICULOUSPREPARATION.
FROM "HEALTH CARE WEB SITE?"TO "FOOTBALL?"
TO "HOW LIBERAL?
MOST LIBERAL?"TO "FOX NEWS!"
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THAT LAST ONE IS JUST A
REMINDER IN CASE BILL FORGETSWHERE HE WORKS.
(LAUGHTER)PLUS, THESE NOTES WERE SIGNED BY
THE PRESIDENT BUT MOREIMPORTANTLY THEY WERE SIGNED BY
BILL O'REILLY!
EVERYTHING THIS MAN TOUCHES ISHISTORIC.
AND THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'MEXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT I'M
AUCTIONING MY HISTORIC BILLO'REILLY ARTIFACT.
YOU SEE, FOLKS, BACK IN 2007 ONAN HISTORIC NIGHT I APPEARED ON
"THE FACTOR" AND BILL CAME ON"THE REPORT." HISTORIANS CAN
DEBATE WHO CAME OUT ON TOP, BUTONLY ONE OF US CAME AWAY WITH
WITH THE OTHER'S MICROWAVEOVEN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT
--(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING ATHERE IS THE ACTUAL MICROWAVE
OVEN I STOLE FROM BILLO'REILLY'S GREEN ROOM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I HAD TO, FOLKS, BECAUSE THIS
CAROUSEL RIGHT HERE?
TECHNICALLY MAKES THIS A SPINZONE.
THAT'S AGAINST THE O'REILLYCONSTITUTION.
FOLKS, THIS IS THE MOSTHISTORICALLY IMPORTANT
JOURNALISTIC MICROWAVE SINCE1977'S DEFROST/NIXON.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, I'M A GOOD GUY SO ALL
PROCEEDS OF THE MICROWAVE OVENWILL GO TO BENEFIT THE YELLOW
RIBBON FUND WHICH HELPS INJUREDSERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR
FAMILIES.
I WAS GOING TO TAKE BILL'S CUEAND OPEN THE BIDDING AT
$10,000 BUT AFTER RESEARCH ONEBAY I FOUND MOST SIX-YEAR-OLD
MICROWAVES GO FOR ABOUT 40BUCKS.
(LAUGHTER)HOWEVER, THIS ONE WAS USED BY
BILL O'REILLY HIMSELF SO WE'LLSTART THE BIDDING AT $43.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WHICH IS A BARGAIN!
WHICH IS A BARGAIN WHEN YOUCONSIDER THAT THE KEYPAD ON THIS
THING CONTAINS MORE WORDS THANBILL'S ENTIRE INTERVIEW NOTES.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)PLUS, THE MICROWAVE WILL BE
SIGNED BY ME AND BY BILLO'REILLY IF HE SIGNS IT.
(LAUGHTER)PLEASE SIGN IT, BILL, IT'S FOR
THE TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
OH, AND IF THE AUCTION IS TOORICH FOR YOUR BLOOD, FOR $10 YOU
CAN BUY A XEROXED COPY --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-- OF AN ACTUAL IPHONE PICTUREOF THE MICROWAVE.
(LAUGHTER)EVERYONE OF THESE XEROXES IS
NUMBERED AND SIGNED-- BY YOU.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT.
I'M ALSO SELLING -- I'M SELLINGPENS.
THIS IS A PILOT PEN AND IT ISSTILL MOSTLY FULL.
(LAUGHTER)SO IF YOU'VE GOT AN
APPRECIATION FOR HISTORY AND/ORA HOT POCKET TO COOK, GET THOSE
BIDS IN TODAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
