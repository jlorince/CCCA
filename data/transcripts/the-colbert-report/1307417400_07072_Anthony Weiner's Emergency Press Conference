( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, OH,
YEAH, THIS IS GOOD STUFF.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
RARE DAYS THAT MAKE ME PROUD
TO BE A NEWSMAN.
TO REPORT HISTORY AS IT
HAPPENS.
BECAUSE I THINK WE WILL ALL
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE WHEN
WE FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS,
IN FACT, ANTHONY WEINER'S
[BLEEP].
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I KNOW, IT'S
SHOCKING.
HE'S SO THIN.
NAKED HE MUST LOOK LIKE A
WINDSOCK HANGING OFF A
PARKING METER.
NOW HE SAID THIS WASN'T HIM.
BUT TODAY AT AN EMERGENCY
PRESS CONFERENCE THE TRUTH
CAME OUT, LIKE A--
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE A DOLPHIN WIGGLING FREE
OF A BLANKET.
JIM.
>> LAST FRIDAY NIGHT I
TWEETED A PHOTOGRAPH OF
MYSELF THAT I INTENDED TO
SEND AS A DIRECT MESSAGE AS
PART OF A JOKE TO A WOMAN IN
SEATTLE.
ONCE I REALIZED I HAD POSTED
IT TO TWITTER I PANICKED,
TOOK IT DOWN AN SAID THAT I
HAD BEEN HACKED.
>> Stephen: HE LIED!
FOR TEN DAYS.
AND ONLY CAME CLEAN TODAY
WHEN ADDITIONAL PHOTOS LIKE
THIS WERE RELEASED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I MEAN THAT IS
ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
THE GUY'S MY AGE AND HE'S
TOTALLY CUT.
IT WOULD BE HARD NOT TO
TWEET A PHOTO LIKE THAT.
THAT IS WHY I HAVE MADE THE
MORAL CHOICE TO LET MYSELF
GO.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I GOT TO TELL
YOU, I AM IN NO WAY TEMPTED
TO SHARE THIS WITH ANYBODY.
PROUD TO SAY I HAVE THE
TORSO OF A 76-YEAR-OLD MAN.
AND FOLKS, IT TURNS OUT
THESE AREN'T EVEN THE ONLY
PHOTOS.
>> TO BE CLEAR THE PICTURE
WAS OF ME AND I SENT IT.
IN ADDITION, OVER THE PAST
FEW YEARS I HAVE ENGAGED IN
SEVERAL INAPPROPRIATE
CONVERSATIONS CONDUCTED OVER
TWITTER, FACEBOOK, E-MAIL
AND OCCASIONALLY ON THE
PHONE.
>> Stephen: NOT TO MENTION
MORSE CODE, PNEUMATIC TUBE
AND SEMAPHORE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT TECHNICALLY, HE WAS NOT
HOLDING A FLAG.
BUT WEINER DID MAKE ONE
THING CLEAR, JIM?
>> TO BE CLEAR, I HAVE NEVER
MET ANY OF THESE WOMEN OR
HAD PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS
AT ANY TIME.
>> Stephen: NO PHYSICAL
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE
WOMEN.
BUT I THINK WE CAN SAY WITH
CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE TWEETS
ENTERED WITH A NOTHINGING OF
THE FAIL WHALE.
IT WAS AFTER THIS HUMILIATING
PUBLIC CONFESSION THAT
REPRESENTATIVE WEINER SAID
THE MOST SHOCKING THING OF
ALL.
>> I WILL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, I HAVE ONE.
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
QUESTIONS?
(LAUGHTER)
AND I HAVE A FOLLOWUP, ARE
YOU READY TO APOLOGISE TO
ANDREW BREITBART.
>> APOLOGIZED TO ANDREW
BREITBART.
>> Stephen: WOW THAT WAS
FAST.
AND WELL, YOU SHOULD
CONGRESSMAN, BREITBART HAS
TAKEN FLACK FOR USING
MISLEADING EDITING IN THE
ACORN PIMP SCANDAL, THE
SHIRLEY SHERROD SCANDAL AND
THE NPR SCANDAL, BUT AFTER
THIS HE IS ONE FOR FOUR.
(LAUGHTER)
AND ALWAYS--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND AS ALWAYS,
BREITBART WAS GRACIOUS IN
VICTORY.
>> IT IS NEWS, MY FRIEND, IT
IS-- IT IS NEWS.
I'M HERE FOR SOME
VINDICATION.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT IT,
ANDY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I THINK IT IS
TIME TO ADMIT NOT ONLY IS
THIS A VALUABLE MEMBER OF
THE PRESS, I WOULD GO SO FAR
AS TO SAY THIS IS THE EDWARD
R. MURROW OF CONGRESSIONAL
WANG PHOTOS.
AND I TELL YOU, FOLKS, THIS
WHOLE SORDID, SAD DELICIOUS
AND SADLY DELICIOUS SORDID
SAGA JUST REINFORCES WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS SAID.
DEMOCRATS DON'T SHARE OUR
VALUES.
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS
TWEETING DIRTY PHOTOS OF
HIMSELF TO STRANGE WOMEN WHO
HE NEVER MEETS FOR SEX?
(LAUGHTER)
COME ON!
AT LEAST REPUBLICANS CHRIS
LEE WAS TRYING TO GET SOME
ACTION.
(LAUGHTER)
REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS
POLITICIANS-- REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS ARE MAN ENOUGH
TO HIT THAT THING.
ENSIGN, VITTER, EVEN WHEN
IT'S A GAY SCANDAL, THEY'RE
NOT TWEETING LOVE LETTERS,
THEY'RE TEARING UP AN
AIRPORT PASSENGER UNTIL
SOMEBODY CALLS THE COPS ON
THEM.
I MEAN--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I MEAN CALL ME
OLD-FASHIONED.
BUT I LONG FOR SIMPLER TIMES
AND COMMON SENSE, VALUES.
I WANT TO LEAVE OUR
GRANDCHILDREN AND AMERICA
WHERE CONGRESSMAN BANG THEIR
SECRETARIESES.
SORRY, SORRY I
