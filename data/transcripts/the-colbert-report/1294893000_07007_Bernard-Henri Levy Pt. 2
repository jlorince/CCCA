EVERYBODY.
THANKS FOR JOINING US AGAIN.
WE ARE BACK WITH RENOWNED FRENCH
PHILOSOPHER BERNARD-HENRI LEVY.
FIRST OF ALL, BERNARD-HENRI,
THAT'S KIND OF FORMAL.
DO YOU MIND IF I CALL YOU BERNIE
HANK?
>> THAT'S THE BEST.
YES.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN NAMED THAT.
I LIKE IT.
>> Stephen: BERNIE HANK.
>> BERNIE HANK.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE ALSO
FAMOUS FOR BEING SORT OF A
MODERN-DAY ALEC DETECHVILLE.
YOU CAME OVER TO THE UNITED
STATES AND YOU WROTE ANOTHER
BOOK THAT IS CALLED "AMERICAN
VERTIGO: TRAVELING MESH IN THE
FOOTSTEPS OF TOCQUEVILLE."
NO OFFENSE, BUT WHAT DOES A
FRIEND CHI KNOW ABOUT AMERICA?
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF PASSING
JUDGMENT ON US?
>> I SAY THAT ALSO IN THIS BOOK
MORE THAN IN THE PREVIOUS ONE, I
LOVE AMERICA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: SEE.
THAT'S AMERICA.
YOU GOT TO LOVE THAT, TOO.
>> NEITHER LOVE, NEITHER
( APPLAUSE ), LISTEN.
I LOVE AMERICA BECAUSE THERE
IS...
>> Stephen: YOU'RE MAKING
FRIENDS.
>> NO, SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE THERE
IS A SENSE OF DEMOCRACY.
FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU REMEMBER THE
NEW ORLEANS TRAGEDY?
>> Stephen: I DON'T.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> OKAY.
THE FLOOD IN NEW ORLEANS.
THE SOLIDARITY OF THE
NEIGHBORING STATES, INCLUDING
TEXAS, WHICH IS NOT THE MOST
DEMOCRATIC STATE IN AMERICA, THE
SOLIDARITY, THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS
OPENING THEIR DOORS.
THIS IS INCONCEIVABLE IN FRANCE
AND IN EUROPE.
SO THIS, FOR EXAMPLE...
>> Stephen: SO IF LYON
FLOODED, PARIS WOULD SAY GO TO
HELL?
>> NO, BUT BERLIN WOULD BE
FLOODED.
>> Stephen: BERLIN WOULD BE
FLOODED.
>> OR ROMA.
>> Stephen: BUT THOSE ARE
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
>> NO, IT'S EUROPE, AND EUROPE
TODAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SORT
OF COUNTRY.
THAT IS AT LEAST WHAT I WISH.
I DON'T DARE SAY TARGET BECAUSE
IT SOUNDS LIKE SARAH PALIN.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT SO EASY,
IT IS?
>> IT IS NOT SO EASY TO ESCAPE
SARAH PALIN THESE TIMES.
>> Stephen: SARAH PALIN IS THE
INESCAPABLE BLACK HOLE OF
POLITICAL RHETORIC.
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.
SERIOUSLY.
YOU HAVE...
>> Stephen: I AM BEING DEADLY
SERIOUS HERE.
>> I KNOW, LIKE JEAN-MARIE LE
PEN IN FRANCE.
IT'S A BLACK HOLE WHERE ALL THE
PLANETS ARE SWALLOWED.
>> Stephen: CAN NEVER ESCAPE.
>> AND THE POLITICAL DEBATE IN
FRANCE HAS BEEN SWALLOWED BY
JEAN-MARIE LE PEN, AND IN
AMERICA IT TENDS TO BE SWALLOWED
BY SARAH PALIN.
AND THIS IS WHAT HAS TO BE
ESCAPED FROM, OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
>> [SPEAKING
