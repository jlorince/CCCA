>> WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> STEVE EBB, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I GOT TO TELL
YOU-- FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL
YOU.
WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT, I
GOT TO TELL YOU YOU'RE A
NATURAL HIGH.
>> FOLKS, I WANT YOU OUT.
>> FOLKS, TONIGHT THE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAD
THEIR SECOND PRESIDENTIAL
DEBATE IN LESS THAN A WEEK.
AND I WAS EXCITED AS A KID
IN A CANDY STORE WHO SPENT
THREE HOURS IN THAT SAME
CANDY STORE LAST WEDNESDAY.
OF COURSE TONIGHT'S DEBATE
IS BEING COHOSTED BY CNN AND
THE TEA PARTY EXPRESS.
SO YOU KNOW IT WON'T BE MORE
OF THE SAME, SAME OLD SAME
OLD.
NOW WE TAPED THE SHOW BEFORE
THE TEA PARTY FACE-OFF.
SO LET ME GIVE YOU A PREVIEW
OF MY ANALYSIS TOMORROW.
OH GOD SO, MUCH BLOOD, WHERE
DID THAT TIGER COME FROM.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS, THE REAL, THE
REAL GAME CHANGER CAME
BEFORE THE DEBATE WHEN
FORMER CANDIDATE TIM
PAWLENTY STOPPED BY TO
BORROW A CUP OF AIR TIME
FROM THE FOLKS & FRIENDS.
>> THERE'S ONE CANDIDATE IN
THIS RACE WHO IS UNMATCHED
IN HIS SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
AND TALENT WHEN IT COMES TO
TURNING AROUND THIS ECONOMY
AND GROWING JOBS.
AND THAT'S MITT ROMNEY AND
I'M PROUD AND EXCITED TO
ENDORSE HIM FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen: THIS IS HUGE FOR
ROMNEY.
JUST WEEKS AGO THESE TWO MEN
WERE BITTER RIVALS, OPPOSITE
IN EVERY WAY AND LOOK AT
THEM NOW.
IT'S LIKE MIRACLE WHIP
ENDORSING MAYONNAISE.
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS, PLUS HE-PAW HAS SIGNED
ON AS THE NATIONAL CO-CHAIR
OF MITT ROMNEY'S CAMPAIGN.
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE
HAS TO GIVE UP HIS OTHER JOB
AS ASSISTANT MANAGER OF THE
ROUTE 23 KINKOS.
THESE GUYS HAVE GROWN SO
CLOSE THAT ROMNEY EVEN
INVITED PAWLENTY TO
TONIGHT'S DEBATE AS HIS PLUS
1.
PLUS 1, ALSO THE NUMBER OF
VOTES HIS ENDORSEMENT HAS
BROUGHT TO THE ROMNEY
CAMPAIGN.
FOLKS--
(APPLAUSE)
>> HE-PAW.
HE
