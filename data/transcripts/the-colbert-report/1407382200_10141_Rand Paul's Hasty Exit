CALL TO END THE WELFARESTATE.
NOW WE ALL KNOW THE RAND MANHAS HIS EYE ON THE WHITE HOUSE
IN 2016, WHICH IS WHYSENATOR PAUL IS
APPEALING TO MINORITY GROUPSUSING A RADICAL STRATEGY OF
BEING APPEALING.
>> SO WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAIDIS PEOPLE WHO SEEK THE
AMERICAN DREAM ARE NOT BADPEOPLE.
SOME PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT THATWAY AND THAT'S A PERCEPTION
WE DO HAVE TO CHANGE.
