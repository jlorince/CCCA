EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE
INTELLECTUAL SUPERSTARS IN
EUROPE, OR AS THEY CALL IT,
"FUTBOL."
PLEASE WELCOME BERNARD-HENRI
LEVY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BON SOIR, MISSURE.
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
NOW, YOU ARE SOMETHING OF A
RARITY IN AMERICA.
YOU ARE A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE PERHAPS
THE MOST FAMOUS, MOST POPULAR
PHILOSOPHER IN FRANCE.
OKAY.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: DO YOU WIN THAT IN
A REALITY SHOW OVER THERE?
"SO YOU THINK YOU CAN PI LOSS
FINDS"?
WHY IS PUBLIC INTELLECTUALISM
POPULAR IN FRANCE?
WE DON'T LIKE IT.
WE THINK OF PUBLIC
INTELLECTUALIZING THE SAME AS
PUBLIC YOU NATION.
>> YOU ARE A SORT OF PUBLIC
INTELLECTUAL.
>> Stephen: SHUT UP.
>> NO, NO, NO.
SERIOUSLY.
I WATCHED YOU ABOUT SARAH PALIN.
>> Stephen: MISSUER.
INTELLECTUALS ARE THINKING ABOUT
THINGS.
I AM FEELING AT THINGS.
THERE IS A DIFTION.
>> BUT THE RESULT IS THE SAME.
>> Stephen: THE RESULT IS THE
SAME?
SO WE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT, YOU
AND I.
>> I THINK SO.
IT DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS GOOD.
>> Stephen: YOU REMIND ME OF A
YOUNG ME.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS GOOD
FOR YOU OR ME, BUT IT IS THE
TRUTH.
I LISTENED AND I LAUGHED.
>> Stephen: I'M GLAD YOU
LISTENED.
>> I SEE.
THEY LAUGH BUT THEY DON'T
LISTEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, I
WANT THE CONGRATULATE YOU ON
LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE A FRENCH
PHILOSOPHER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> WHICH IS WHAT?
>> Stephen: OH, THE OPEN
SHIRT, THE LITTLE CHEST SHOWING,
SWEEPING HAIR, YOU KNOW, THE
SLIGHTLY JUST ON THE BORDER OF
LOOKING LIKE A CONDUCTOR.
THIS IS TRUTH THAT THERE'S GOD
BECAUSE EVOLUTION COULDN'T DO
THIS.
THIS WAS INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: BY THE WAY, IS
THERE A GOD?
>> I THINK SO.
>> Stephen: YOU DO?
BUT YOU'RE A FAMOUS ATHEIST.
YOU'RE LIKE THE POPE OF
ATHEISTS.
>> NO, NO.
MY THEORY IN THE NEW BOOK IN
"PUBLIC ENEMIES" IS THAT GOD
EXISTS BUT THAT HE WITHDREW FROM
THE WORLD.
GOD WENT AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD
BETTER TO DO THAN MANAGE THE
WORLD AND US.
>> Stephen: HE'S A BUSY GUY.
>> HE'S A BUSY DISIE.
AND HE TOLD TO MANKIND, DO IT
YOURSELF.
I HAVE AN EYE ON YOU.
I WATCH YOU, BUT DO IT YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE MAN THAT YOU WROTE THIS BOOK
WITH.
IT'S CALLED "PUBLIC ENEMIES:
DUELING WRITERS TAKE ON EACH
OTHER AND THE WORLD."
TELL ME HOW THIS BOOK CAME
ABOUT.
IT'S A FASCINATING STORY.
>> THIS BOOK CAME BECAUSE ONE
DAY I RECEIVED A TEXT TELLING ME
HE WAS DECEMBER -- DISSPARED,
READY TO COMMIT SUICIDE.
SO I SENT HIM A TEXT AND I SAID,
"WAIT A MINUTE BEFORE COMMITTING
SUICIDE.
LET'S HAVE DINNER FIRST."
>> Stephen: THANK GOD IT WAS A
TEXT.
IF IT WAS SNAIL MAIL, YOU WOULD
NEVER HAVE GOTTEN...
>> IT IS TRUE.
IT IS TRUE.
THIS IS ONE ADVANTAGE OF THE
TECHNOLOGY.
>> Stephen: SO WHY WAS HE IN
DISSPARE?
>> WE HAD DINNER.
HE TOLD ME HE WAS IN DISSPARE
BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH HIS
LIFE, PROBLEMS WITH MAYBE
SOMEBODY ELSE.
>> Stephen: PROBLEMS WITH HIS
MISTRESS?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
YOU SAID IT.
PROBLEMS WITH HIS DOG.
>> Stephen: WITH HIS DOG?
>> WITH HIS DOG.
WITH HIS PET DOG.
>> Stephen: HIS PET DOG.
>> AND PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE HAS
NOBODY TO DEBATE WITH.
>> Stephen: I HAVE TO SAY,
SIR, IF YOU'VE COME TO THE POINT
THAT YOU'RE DEBATING YOUR DOG,
YOU'RE TOO FAR GONE.
>> SO WHAT DID I ANSWER, YOUR
WIFE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING, YOUR
SECOND PROBLEM, EVEN LESS, YOUR
DOG, FORGET IT, BUT DEBATE,
LET'S DEBATE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU WROTE
LETTERS BACK AND FORTH IN
DEBATE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO LET ME BE CLEAR
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
AMERICA AND EUROPE.
THIS IS A BECOME OF INTELLECTUAL
PHILOSOPHERS WRITING A DEBATE IN
LETTERS, AND IT'S AN ENORMOUS
HIT IN EUROPE.
THEY LOVE THIS 678 THEY GOBBLE
IT UP.
YOU'RE LIKE A ROCK STAR, RIGHT?
YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET AND
PEOPLE GO...
>> BER!
AND WELLBECK EVEN MORE.
HE'S A HUGE TALENT.
AND THE DOG OF WELLBECK.
THE BIGGEST STAR OF US THREE IS
NOT WELLBECK, BUT THE DOG.
>> Stephen: I BET HE'S GETTING
ALL KIND OF BITCHES.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL STAY RIGHT THERE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE
