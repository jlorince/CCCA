I AM HERE WITH SPACE X ANDTESLA MOTORS FOUNDER ELON
MUSK.
THE TWO OF US ARE TALKING ASI SAID I'VE GOT A TESLA AND
I LOVE THE CAR.
AND IT'S MILES-- IT'S THEBEST DAMN GOLF CART I'VE
EVER DRIVEN. IT REALLY, THEACCELERATION IS INCREDIBLE.

THEY WON'T LET ME TAKE IT ONTHE LINKS AT MY CLUB BUT
OTHER THAN THAT, YOURECENTLY MADE ALL THE
PATENTS FOR TESLA AVAILABLETO EVERYBODY.
SAY WE ARE NOT GOINGTO PROSECUTE PEOPLE IF THEY USE
OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY
OF TESLA.
WHY ARE YOU GIVING AWAY THESTORE LIKE THAT.
WHY ARE YOU BEING THE EDWARDSNOWDEN OF YOU
>> RIGHT. I'M NOT SURE IF THISIS
THE RIGHT ANALOGY, BUT IF WEARE ALL ON A SHIP TOGETHER
AND WE-- AND THERE'S SOMEHOLES IN THE SHIP AND WE
ARE BAILING WATER OUT, ANDWE HAVE A GREAT DESIGN FOR A
BUCKET, THEN YOU KNOW, EVENIF WE ARE BAILING OUT WAY
BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE,WE SHOULD PROBABLY STILL
SHARE THE BUCKET DESIGN.
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TOSINK.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: LAST QUESTION,
YOU'RE A FUTURE MAN, WHERE IS MYJET PACK.
>> YOU KNOW, YOUCAN-- ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK
ON YOUTUBE THERE IS A LOT OFINTERESTING VIDEO.
>> Stephen: I DON'T WANT ACAT IN THE JET PACK, I WANT
TO GET IN THE JET PACK
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU WORKEDON A JET PACK OF YOUR OWN.
>> I HAVEN'T, NO.
NO, I-- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT JETPACKS.
THERE IS SOME FUNDAMENTALPHYSICS THAT MAKE IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO HAVE A JET PACKIT WOULD BE VERY NOISY.
>> Stephen: IT'S HARD TO LAND A ROCKET ON ITS TAIL
TOO.
>> TRUE.
>> Stephen: EYES ON THEPRIZE.
>> BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ITHINK WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE
IS IF THAT AIRCRAFT SHOULDHAVE VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND
LANDING.
>> Stephen: LIKE A HARRIER.
>> KIND OF LIKE A HARRIERBUT IT'S BETTER TO MOVE WITH
THE FAN THEN IT IS TO DUCTTHE AIR.
>> Stephen: RIGHT NOW THEHARRIER DOES IT WITH DUCTS?
AND DUCT TAPE, ONE IMAGINES.
>> I THINK THE HARRIER IS AGREAT PLANE BUT I THINK
THERE IS A REAL OPPORTUNITYTO HAVE A VERTICAL TAKEOFF
AND LANDING, ELECTRICSUPERSONIC JET.
>> Stephen: ELECTRIC JET.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THAT SHOOTSSPARKS OUT THE BACK.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW DO YOU HAVE AN ELECTRICJET.
>> YOU USE AN ELECTRIC MOTOR TODRIVE A FAN.
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY.
>> YEAH.
>> IT'S-- ACTUALLY JETAIRCRAFT ARE MOSTLY SOUND
DRIVEN-- TRADITIONAL JETAIRCRAFT LIKE WHEN YOU SEE
SOMETHING CALLED A JETENGINE LIKE ON A TRIPLE 7,
IT'S GOT THAT HUGE-- ITLOOKS HUGE, AND THAT IS
BECAUSE MOST OF THEPROPULSION IS REALLY COMING
FROM THE FAN.
SO-- .
>> Stephen: SO YOU NEED ABIG FAN.
>> YEAH.
IT'S REALLY-- .
>> Stephen: REALLY IT'S APROP PLANE THAT THEY DRESSED
UP TO LOOK LIKE A JET.
>> KIND OF THAT, YEAH.
>> Stephen: I HAVE BEEN LIEDTO.
>> WELL, THERE'S SOME VALUETO HAVING DUCTS BUT IT'S
ACTUALLY MORE EFFICIENT TOHAVE AN OPEN FAN IF YOU JUST
CARE ABOUT EFFICIENCY PERMILE BUT YOU CAN GO FASTER
IF YOU HAVE A DUCTSITUATION.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS NEXT,WHAT IS THE NEXT THING, WHAT
ARE GOING TO BLOW MY MINDWITH?
>> WELL-- WHAT DO YOU WISHTHERE WAS?
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I WISH THEREWEREN'T ANY CABLES.
I WISH THAT COMPUTERS DIDN'THAVE TO BE TYPED INTO.
I THINK THE MOUSE ON THEKEYBOARD IS TERRIBLE.
IT'S A TERRIBLE INTERFACE,THAT I SHOULD HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEMACHINE AND I WOULD HAVE A
DISCUSSION OF MY NEEDS ANDIT WOULD DO IT.
>> RIGHTS.
>> Stephen: AND I ALSO THINKTHAT CABLES ON ANYTHING IS
TERRIBLE.
NOT COMMUNICATION, BUTCHARGING CABLES AS WELL.

THINGS WAS CHARGE.

CHARGING SYSTEM AND THATANYWHERE I WENT IN THE
UNITED STATES, THERE WOULDBE A CHARGE THAT WOULD
FOLLOW ME AROUND.
