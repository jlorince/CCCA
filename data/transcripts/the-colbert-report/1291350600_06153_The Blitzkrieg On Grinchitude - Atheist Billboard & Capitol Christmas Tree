EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU.
NATION, WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A
WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
SO MANY PEOPLE FORGET THAT THIS
SEASON IS ABOUT JESUS CHRIST AND
THE SACRIFICES HE MADE FOR
MANKIND, INCLUDING THE ULTIMATE
SACRIFICE, HAVING HIS BIRTHDAY
ON CHRISTMAS.
( LAUGHTER )
IT JUST GETS LUMPED IN THERE AND
YOU GET HALF THE PRESENTS.
WELL, I FOR ONE WILL NOT STAND
FOR PEOPLE TAKING THE CHRIST OUT
OF CHRISTMAS.
THIS YEAR I'M PUTTING A LITTLE
EXTRA CHRIST IN THERE BY WISHING
EVERYBODY A MERRY CHRIST
CHRISTMAS CHRIST, WHICH BRINGS
ME TO MY ANNUAL SEGMENT DEAD --
DEDICATED TO THE WAR ON THE WAR
ON CHRISTMAS.
THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON
GRINCH-ITUDE.
>> HO, HO, HO.
[GUNFIRE]
HOOOO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THAT REALLY
LOOKED GREAT IN H.D.
FOLKS, ONCE AGAIN, THE
ARRESTISTS ARE TRYING TO KICK US
IN THE JINGLE BALLS.
THIS YEAR THEY'RE ATTACKING US
AT ONE OF OUR MOST SACRED
LOCATION, OUTSIDE THE LINCOLN
TUNNEL.
>> JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS, A
BRAND-NEW BILLBOARD IN NEW
JERSEY IS RAISING SOME EYEBROWS,
A SILHOUETTE OF THE THREE
WISEMEN APPROACHING THE NATIVITY
WITH THE WORDS, "YOU KNOW IT'S A
MYTH."
A MYTH?
>> Stephen: WHAT PART OF THREE
KINGS FOLLOWING A STAR THROUGH A
DESERT TO BRING PRESENTS TO AN
IMMACULATELY CONCEIVED BABY GOD
THEY CEMENT ABOUT SOUNDS LIKE A
MYTH TO YOU?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE'S NO MINUTE ATAR IN THERE.
AND WHY DID THE ATHEISTS PUT UP
THIS BILLBOARD NOW?
DAVID SILVERMAN, THE PRESIDENT
OF THE AMERICAN ATHEISTS
EXPLAINS.
>> THE PURPOSE OF IT IS SO MAKE
ATHEISTS WHO ARE IN THE CLOSET
COME OUT.
>> Stephen: COME OUT?
HE'S NOT JUST TRYING TO MAKE US
ATHEISTS.
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE US
GAYTHEISTS.
THANK GOODNESS, NO, CHECK, THAT
THANK GAUDINESS MY -- GODNESS MY
FRIEND AT THE CATHOLIC LEAGUE
RESPONDED.
>> THEIR BILLBOARD SAYS "YOU
KNOW IT'S REAL.
THIS SEASON CELEBRATE JESUS."
THE CATHOLIC LEAGUE SAYS IT'S A
COUNTER-PUNCH.
>> JUST LIKE JESUS SAYS, IF
SOMEONE SLAPS YOU ON THE CHEEK,
COUNTER-PUNCH.
WAY TO GO, CATHOLIC LEAGUE.
THOUGH IF YOU TRULY HAD FAITH,
YOU COULD DITCH YOUR CAR AND
JUST WALK ACROSS THE HUDSON.
THESE PROVOCATIVE BILLBOARDS...
THESE PROVOCATIVE BILLBOARDS
COMPETING FOR DRIVER'S ATTENTION
HAS LED THE TUNNEL AUTHORITY TO
PUT UP THEIR OWN BILLBOARDS.
JESUS CHRIST, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
DRIVING.
NOW, I'M HAPPY TO SAY, FOLKS, I
AM HAPPY TO SAY THE CATHOLIC
LEAGUE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS IN THE
TRADITIONAL WAY.
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, BELLS ARE
RINGING, CAROLERS ARE CAROLING
AND TREES ARE TWEETING.
JIM?
>> THE CAPITAL CHRISTMAS TREE
HAS ALIVES IN WASHINGTON.
THE 67-FOOT SPRUCE WAS CHOPPED
DOWN EARLIER THIS MONTH IN
WYOMING.
HERE'S THE WEST PART, IN A TRUE
SIGN OF THE SIGNS, THE OFFICIAL
CAPITAL TREE HAS A TWITTER
ACCOUNT.
>> YES, A CHRISTMAS TREE WITH A
QUITTER ACCOUNT.
FINALLY A WAY TO GET KIDS
EXCITED ABOUT CHRISTMAS.
THE TWITTER FEED LETS YOU FOLLOW
THE CAPITAL TREE ACROSS THE
COUNTRY FROM WYOMING.
ON TUESDAY THE TREE TWEETED THAT
IT WAS SO EXCITED TO BE HERE AT
THE CAPITAL AND LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE LIGHTING CEREMONY ON THE
SEVENTH.
THAT LYING CEREMONY WILL BE
PRESIDE OVER BY SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE NANCY PELOSI, WHO WILL
FINALLY MEET SOMETHING THAT CAN
OUTBLINK HER.
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S LOOK AT SOME EARLIER
TWEETS.
GOOD MORNING, SON, IT'S MY
234th BIRTHDAY.
OH, LOOK, LUMBERJACKS ARE COMING
TO HELP ME CELEBRATE.
OH, GOD, THEY'RE HACKING AT MY
SHINS.
LET'S GO TO THE NEXT DAY.
SO COLD.
SAP EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE CHAINING ME TO A TRUCK.
TELL MY PINE CONES I LOVE THEM.
THIS IS FUN.
UH-OH, I JUST GOT A TWEET FROM
THE TREE.
OH, THEY'RE DRESSING ME UP IN
TINSEL AND LIGHTS LIKE A CHEAP
WHORE AND THEY'RE MAKING THE
CHILDREN WATCH.
I'M SORRY.
THAT LAST TWEET WAS FROM KIM
KARDASHIAN.
ANYWAY
