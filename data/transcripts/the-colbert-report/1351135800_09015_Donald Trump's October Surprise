FOLKS, HUGE NEWS.
WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING TO BRING
YOU THE BIGGEST ELECTION STORY.

A GAME-CHANGING OCTOBER
SURPRISE.

HAVE A BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT
ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

DONALD TRUMP COMING TODAY, AND
WHY IT MIGHT CHANGE YOUR VOTE IN
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

BIG.
IT'S VERY BIG.
BIGGER THAN ANYONE WOULD KNOW.
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY BIG, I
KNOW ONE THING-- YOU WILL COVER
IT IN A VERY BIG FASHION.

WINDOWS, STOCK UP ON CANNED
MEATS --THIS WILL BE THE
BIGGEST, CLASSIEST, MOST
DEVASTATING ELECTION
GAME-CHANGER IN THE HUMAN
HISTORY OF TIME.

TEAPOT IS ENCRUSTED WITH GOLD
AND WE'RE USING DIAMOND TEA
BAGS.

THE SPECULATION WAS RAMPANT.
WAS IT THE LONG-RUMORED OBAMA
DIVORCE PAPERS?
PROOF THAT OBAMA'S WHITE HALF IS
ALSO BLACK?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, EVEN BIGGER.
TRUMP DROPPED A TEN-MEGA-TRUMP
BOMBSHELL.
>> IF BARACK OBAMA OPENS UP AND
GIVES HIS COLLEGE RECORDS AND
APPLICATIONS; AND IF HE GIVES
HIS PASSPORT APPLICATIONS AND
RECORDS; I WILL GIVE TO A
CHARITY OF HIS CHOICE-- INNER
CITY CHILDREN IN CHICAGO,
AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AIDS
RESEARCH, ANYTHING HE WANTS--  A
CHECK, IMMEDIATELY, FOR FIVE
MILLION DOLLARS.
ONE CAVEAT:  THE RECORDS MUST BE
GIVEN BY OCTOBER 31ST AT 5:00 IN
THE AFTERNOON.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE HAS TO HAVE IT BY 5:00 ON
HALLOWEEN.

BECAUSE THAT NIGHT
HE'S RENTING OUT HIS ENORMOUS
ORANGE HEAD AS A JACK-O-LANTERN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S
NOT ABOUT HIM.
IT'S ABOUT HELPING.
>> FRANKLY, IT'S A CHECK THAT I
VERY MUCH WANT TO WRITE.
MR. PRESIDENT, NOT ONLY WILL I
BE HAPPY, AND BY THE WAY TOTALLY
SATISFIED, BUT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY AND YOU
KNOW WHAT?
THOSE CHARITIES WILL BE VERY
HAPPY.
>> STEPHEN: NATION, I AM SO
MOVED BY THIS GENEROUS OFFER
THAT I HAVE AN OFFER OF MY OWN.
RIGHT OVER HERE.

CHECK FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS
FROM COLBERT SUPER PAC-- YOU
