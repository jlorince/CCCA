>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THERE IS DANGER
AROUND EVERY CORNER BUT
DON'T FORGET THE CORNER
ITSELF.
THEY CAN BE SURPRISINGLY
SHARP.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, FOLKS, HORRIFYING
NEWS OUT OF THE UKRAINE.
FOR MORE WE GO TO CT I WANT
TO SAY 5 WITH A LINE DOWN
THE BACK.
UKRAINE'S NEWS LEADER.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BEAR IN A CAGE
AND A LARGE BALD MAN,
CLEARLY UKRAINIAN LOVE
STORY.
BUT NO, THE UKRAINES
ENVIRONMENTAL MINISTER AND
WHITE VING RHAMES MYKOLA
ZLOCHEVSKY HAVE VOWED TO PUT
AN END TO THE UKRAINIAN
PRACTICE OF FORCING BEARS TO
DRINK VODKA FOR HUMAN
ENTERTAINMENT.
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THREAT
NUMBER THREE.
BEARS IN REHAB.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, WE CANNOT HAVE BEARS-- WE
CAN'T HAVE BEARS GO THROUGH
THE 12 STEP PROGRAM.
FIRST OFF, THEY'LL EAT THEIR
SPONSORS.
HOW CAN THEY ACCEPT A HIGHER
POWER WHEN THEIR GODLESS
KILLING MACHINES.
THEY MAY BE GOING COLD
TURKEY BUT THAT COLD TURKEY
IS JUST AN APPETIZER FOR
HOTMAN.
KEEP THEM DRUNK.
NEXT UP, A DISTURBING STORY
OUT OF CONNECTICUT.
>> HE SAYS HE AWOKE AND
HEARD A LOUD NOISE.
HE CAME OUT ON TO HIS DESK,
LOOKED DOWN AND RIGHT HERE
AT HIS BIRTH YEAR WAS A
GIANT BEAR.
THE BEAR STAYED IN HIS
BACKYARD FOR ABOUT HALF AN
HOUR CHOMPING AWAY AT THE
FOOD INSIDE THE BIRD
FEEDERS.
>> Stephen: NOTHING TO SEE
HERE, INNOCENT ENOUGH BUT
LISTEN TO THE MAN'S NAME.
>> RICH COLBERT SAYS BOTH
TIMES THE BEAR HAS BEEN HERE
HAS GONE AFTER HIS BIRD
FEEDER.
>> Stephen: RICH COLBERT,
FOLKS, CLEARLY I'M BEING
HUNTED.
THEY'VE HEARD ABOUT MY
ANTI-BEAR STANCE AND THIS
BEAR IS GOING THROUGH ALL
THE COLBERTS IN THE PHONE
BOOK LOOKING FOR ME.
WHERE--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHERE HAVE I
SEEN THAT BEFORE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT
NUMBER TWO.
BEAR TERMINATORS.
NOW FOLKS--
(APPLAUSE)
I'M NOT SAYING THAT HE'S A
CYBORG BEAR, THAT WOULD BE
INSANE.
I'M JUST SAYING HE'S A BEAR
SENT FROM THE FUTURE TO KILL
ME, MANKIND'S ONLY REMAINING
HOPE IN THE INEVITABLE BEAR
WAR OF 2025.
AND RICHARD COLBERT, THE
BEAR'S ALREADY UP TO THE Rs.
NEXT, NEXT-- NEXT COMES-- NEXT
COMES RODNEY, RONALD, RUPERT,
THEN SAMMY, SERGIO AND SIMON.
THEN ME.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IF ANY BEARS ASK YOU,
THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT.
OKAY?
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OH, AND BEARS,
BEARS, HE TASTES LIKE HONEY.
DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW.
FINALLY, FOLKS, THERE'S A
NEW KIND OF BURGLAR PREYING
ON CALIFORNIA.
>> A BLACK BEAR TAKES A WILD
RIDE AFTER STEALING A CAR.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE WRECKAGE
OF THIS PRIUS, A BLACK BEAR
CLIMBED COMPLETELY INTO IT
WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED
OUTSIDE A LAKE TAHOE CABIN.
IT SOMEHOW HIT THE GEAR
SHIFT AND ENDED UP DRIVING
THE CAR BACKWARDS.
>> Stephen: APPARENTLY A
BEAR ALSO SHIFTS IN THE
WOODS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS--
(APPLAUSE)
TRUE STORY, TRUE STORY.
BUT FOLKS, THIS PRIUS
DRIVING ERSINE BRINGS ME TO
THE NUMBER ONE THREAT IN
AMERICA, SANCTIMONIOUS ENVIE
RO BEARS.
IT IS BAD ENOUGH THEY EAT
ORGANIC SALMON, RIDE AROUND
ON BIKES AND ARE LITERALLY
TREE HUGGERS, NOW THEY'RE
DRIVING HYBRIDS.
SO NOW INSTEAD OF MALLING
YOU TO DEATH, IT WILL BORE
YOU TO DEATH BYIAMERING ON
ABOUT HOW YOUR WATER BOTTLE
IS LEECHING BPA INTO YOUR
BODY.
PLUS THESE GRR-NOLA MUNCHERS
ARE JUST A BUNCH OF
HYPOCRITES.
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THEY
LITTER THE ARCTIC WITH THEIR
COKE BOTTLES AND NEVER USE
