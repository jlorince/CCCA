( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, SUMMER IS COMING AND I
KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR JUST THE
RIGHT VACATION.
WHAT WILL KIDS LIKE, THE BEACH,
THE MOUNTAINS?
THE ANSWER IS AS ALWAYS, THEIR
iPADS.
NOT ANYMORE, FOLKS, BECAUSE THIS
SUMMER YOU CAN SHOW YOUR KIDS
THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES AT THE
LIBRARY.
>> ON THURSDAY, THE BUSH FAMILY
DEDICATES THE GEORGE W. BUSH
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN DALLAS.
IT OPENED TO THE PUBLIC MAY 1.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, MAY
1, 10 YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE
GEORGE BUSH FAMOUSLY LANDED ON
THE DECK OF THE USS "ABRAHAM
LINCOLN" AND DECLARED MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED, WHICH MEANS THE
LIBRARY WILL BE FINISHED IN
ANOTHER EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NATION, I AM SO PUMPED!
BECAUSE THIS THING IS GOING TO
BE PACKED WITH BUSH-NOGRAPHY.
MORE THAN 43,000 ARTIFACTS AND
200 MILLION E-MAILS WILL BE ON
DISPLAY.
AND THOSE 200 MILLION E-MAILS
COULD HAVE ALMOST 18 NONREDACTED
WORDS.
BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE BEST
PART.
>> WOULD YOU HAVE INVADED IRAQ
IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT?
OR BAIL OUT WALL STREET?
FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD
HAVE DONE.
IT'S PART OF A NEW INTERACTIVE
THEATER FEATURED IN THE GEORGE
W. BUSH PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND
MUSEUM.
>> Stephen:  YES, THE LIBRARY
INCLUDES INTERACTIVE ROLE
PLAYING WHERE THE PRESIDENT
HANDS OVER THE REINS OF POWER
TO SOMEONE ELSE, JUST LIKE HE
DID WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S LIKE-- WHAT'S IT LIKE.
IT'S LIKE-- IT'S LIKE A
PRESIDENTIAL "CHOOSE YOUR OWN
ADVENTURE."
I MEAN, WOULD YOU DEPLOY FEDERAL
TROOPS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA,
OR RELY ON LOCAL FORCES?
WOULD YOU BAIL OUT WALL STREET,
OR LET THE BANKS FAIL?
WOULD YOU INVADE IRAQ OR LEAVE
SADDAM HUSSEIN IN POWER?
IT REALLY GIVES YOU PERSPECTIVE.
LET'S SEE YOU SIFT THROUGH
MOUNTAINS OF INTELLIGENCE SAYING
SADDAM DIDN'T HAVE WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION TO FINDS THE
ONE MEMO THAT IMPLIES THAT HE
MIGHT.
BUT, FOLKS, AS EXCITED AS
I AM, I MUST CONFESS THERE IS
SOMETHING THAT DEEPLY
DISAPPOINTED ME ABOUT THE BUSH
LIBRARY.
I AM NOT INVITED TO THURSDAY'S
DEDICATION.
>> AWWWW.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU.
AND I'M HURT.
ON MY INSIDE FEELING PART.
( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, AT THE END OF THIS MAN'S
PRESIDENCY, EVEN AS MY FELLOW
CONSERVATIVES WERE ABANDONING
BUSH LIKE RATS ON A SINKING SHIP
ON A CRASH COURSE WITH CAT
ISLAND, I REMAINED FAITHFUL, AND
I'M SURE HE KNOWS THAT FROM THE
WARRANTLESS WIRETAPS HE
AUTHORIZED.
THAT'S OKAY, MR. PRESIDENT.
I FORGIVE YOU.
AND I WILL BE THERE ON DAY ONE,
AND SO SHOULD YOU, NATION.
YOU CAN BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE
NOW.
OF COURSE, SOME OF THEM WILL BE
FOR THE BUSH PRESIDENTIAL
LIBRARY.
AND SOME WILL BE FOR THE GORE
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE TICKET COUNTERS WILL
READ THEM ALL AS BUSH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
