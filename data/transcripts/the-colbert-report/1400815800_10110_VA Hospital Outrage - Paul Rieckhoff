SO, VETERANS, AS MUCH AS THIS ISA REAL SCANDAL-- AND IT IS-- I
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
HERE TO MAKE ME TALK ABOUT IT ISTHE FOUNDER OF THE IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTANS VETERAN OF AMERICA,PAUL RIECKHOFF.
PAUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN, GREAT TOTALK TO YOU.
>> Stephen:  GOOD TO SEE YOU.
PAUL, PAUL, DO WE REALLY HAVE TOTALK ABOUT THE V.A.?
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY, YES.
>> Stephen:  BUT HOW MUCHLONGER, HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE VETERANS?
IT'S MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.
I'VE GOT A PICNIC TO GO TO.
>> WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TOTALK ABOUT IT FOR DECADES.
THESE VETERANS ARE GOING TO BEAROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND
THEY'RE AMAZING LEADERS AND THEYDESERVE THIS COUNTRY'S FULL CARE
AND SUPPORT AND, UNFORTUNATELY,WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR PICNIC OR AT
THE BEACH, A LOT OF OUR VETERANSTHIS WEEKEND WILL BE AT
ARLINGTON PAYING THEIR RESPECTSTO THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEY LOST.
IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS COUNTRYSTEPPED UP AND REALLY SUPPORTED
OUR VETERANS. YOU HAVE BEENGREAT.
I'VE GOT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT.
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OURVETERANS.
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD OUR BACKS ANDWE APPRECIATE THAT.
BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TOFOLLOW YOUR LEAD, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, I WISHAMERICA WOULD BE MORE LIKE ME.
THANK YOU, PAUL.
HOW BIG OF A SCANDAL IS THIS ONA SCALE OF 1 TO BENGHAZI.
>> OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IFBENGHAZI IS A POLITICAL
HEADACHE, THIS IS GOING TO BE ASTROKE.
I MEAN, THIS IS IS NOT GOINGAWAY.
IT'S REALLY BAD.
IT AFFECTS MILLIONS OF VETERANSWHO USE THE V.A. CARE.
IT'S BEEN IN 10 CITIES ALREADY.
WE THINK THERE MAY BE MORE.
AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT THEVETERANS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT IS
NOW INSPECTING 26 CITIES.
SO OUR MEMBERS, HUNDREDS OFTHOUSAND OF THEM NATIONWIDE ARE
OUTRAGED.
THEY'RE BETRAYED.
AND THEY NEED REAL LEADERSHIPAND REFORM AND ACTION FROM
SHINSEKI AND THE PRESIDENT ANDTHE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen:  THERE HAVE BEEN SCANDALS AND MISMANAGEMENT AT
THE V.A. SINCE I WAS A KID.
WHY HAS THIS ONE BROKEN THROUGH?
>> I THINK THIS THE COUNTRY ISPAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE 40
VETERANS MAY HAVE DIED WAITINGAND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
VETERANS WHO DIED WAITING INOTHER CITIES.
MAYBE IT'S A PERFECT STORM.
MAYBE THE COUNTRY IS FINALLY FEDUP HEARING STORY AFTER STORY
FROM THE V.A. ABOUT HOW OURVETERANS ARE BEING NEGLECTED AND
DISAPPOINTED AND MAYBE WE CANFINALLY BREAK THROUGH.
IF THERE'S A SILVER LINING IT'STHE COUNTRY FINALLY WAKES UP
AND UNDERSTANDS THAT OURVETERANS ARE A TREMENDOUS
RESOURCE. THEY DESERVE OURSUPPORT AND OUR LOVE AND
THEY DESERVE A V.A. THAT WORKS.WE'RE NOT ASKING FAIR LOT HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT SAID-- THEPRESIDENT SAID HE DID NOT HEAR
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SCANDALUNTIL HE SAW IT ON CNN.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  CAN YOU BELIEVETHAT?
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE AREWATCHING CNN?
( LAUGHTER )>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT?
NOW CNN'S FINALLY GOT SOMETHINGTO COVER OTHER THAN THE PLANE.
AND THIS IS A REAL ISSUE.
THEY'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON IT.
AND OTHER FOLKS IN THE MEDIAHAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON IT.
AND THIS IS NOT GOING TO GOAWAY.
EVEN IF THE HEADLINES FADE WENEED EVERYBODY TO CONTINUE TO
STEP UP, HOLD PEOPLE INWASHINGTON ACCOUNTABLE AND
SUPPORT OUR VETERANS EVERY DAYOF THE YEAR.
>> Stephen:  LET ME ASK YOU AQUESTION THAT I WOULD ONLY ASK
BECAUSE THIS IS VIA SATELLITEAND YOU'RE HUNDREDS OF MILES
AWAY.
IS THE V.A. HEALTH CARE SYSTEMTHE REASON YOU'RE STILL WAITING
FOR THAT HAIR TRANSPLANT?
>> NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,STEPHEN?
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, STEPHEN, I THINKIT'S ABOUT TIME YOU SHAVED YOUR
HEAD AGAIN.
AND YOU CAN DO IT FOR CHARITY--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE COULD HOOK YOU UP.
YOU LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HOOK YOU UP.
>> Stephen:  MAYBE NEXT TIMEIF YOU'RE NOT HERE BY SATELLITE.
PAUL RIECKHOFF, THE I.A.V.A.
THANK YOU, PAUL.
