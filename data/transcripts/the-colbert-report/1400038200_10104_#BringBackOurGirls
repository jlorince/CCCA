NATION, THE WORLD IS AGHAST ATTHE HORRIFIC SITUATION IN
NIGERIA.
AFTER THE KIDNAPPING LAST MONTHOF MORE THAN 300 SCHOOL GIRLS,
BY THE ISLAMIST TERRORIST GROUPBOKO HARAM.
OUT OF DESPERATION, LOCALACTIVISTS STARTED THE TWITTER
HASHTAG #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS, INORDER TO PLEAD FOR INTERNATIONAL
PRESSURE TO RESCUE THE GIRLSBECAUSE THEIR PARENTS HAD GIVEN
UP ON NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICHIS SHOCKING-- EVIDENTLY, NIGERIA
HAS A GOVERNMENT.
I KNEW THEY HAD A PRINCE.
I KEEP E-MAILING HIM MONEY.
WHY DOESN'T HE DO SOMETHING?
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHAT STARTED AS A HASHTAG HASBECOME A MOVEMENT.
>> #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS HAS BECOMEA WORLDWIDE SOCIAL MEDIA
CAMPAIGN WITH MORE THAN AMILLION TWEETS BEING PUBLISHED
USING THE HASHTAG.
>> THE INTERNATIONAL OUTCRYCENTERS ON A TWITTER HASHTAG
APPROPRIATELY TITLED#BRINGBACKOURGIRLS.
>> #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS HAS NOWBEEN USED OVER A MILLION TIMES.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, IT'SREFRESHING TO SEE THE WORLD GET
BEHIND A HASHTAG CAMPAIGN THATHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FIRING
ME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NORMALLY--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, ILOVE INTERNET MEMES.
AFTER ALL, THE WORD "MEME" ISJUST THE WORD "ME" TWICE.
AND THIS ONE IS HUGE.
EVEN MICHELLE OBAMA JUMPED ONTHE HASH-TWAGON.
BUT I CANNOT GET BEHIND THISTWITTER CAMPAIGN BECAUSE NONE OF
MY FRIENDS ARE INTO IT.
>> THIS PICTURE IS OF THE FIRSTLADY.
I JUST THINK THIS IS PATHETIC.
>> DO SOMETHING REAL, FOLKS, NOTJUST SIT HERE AND THINK HOLDING
SIGNS IS THE SAME AS ACTIONS.
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S REALLYABOUT HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO
TWEET THE HASHTAG FEEL BETTERABOUT THEMSELVES?
>> EXACTLY THAT.
IT'S AN EXERCISE IN SELF-ESTEEM.
ARE THESE BARBARIANS IN THEWILDS OF NIGERIA SUPPOSED TO
CHECK THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT ANDSAY UH-OH.
MICHELLE OBAMA IS CROSS WITH US.
WE BETTER CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR.
>> Stephen:  YES, TERRORISTSIN THE WILD ARE NOT ON TWITTER.
THEY'RE UP TO NASTY BUSINESS.
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE USING SNAPCHAT.
BESIDES, YOU DO NOT LAUNCH ATWITTER CAMPAIGN TO RESCUE
KIDNAPPED DAUGHTERS.
YOU SEND IN LIAM NEESON.
HASHTAG PARTICULAR SET OFSKILLS.
