THE BOAT.
MOST OF THEM WOULD HAVE
RATHER BEEN SPENDING
CHRISTMAS DAY WITH THEIR
FAMILIES.

HE GOT THEM INTO THE BOAT.
THAT'S HUGE.

THIS PAINTING ITSELF HAVE TO
DO WITH OUR VISION OF
WASHINGTON TODAY, DID THIS
HELP SHAPE OUR MODERN MYTHO
OF WASHINGTON.

ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT
MOUNT VERNON WAS CREATED.
