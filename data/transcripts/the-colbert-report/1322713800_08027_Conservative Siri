>> STEPHEN: HEY, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, I HAD THE OLD IPHONE
OUT EARLIER.
I REMINDED ME I'M A FAN OF
APPLE'S VOICE RECOGNITION
SOFTWARE SIRI.
IT'S GOT ALL THE CONVENIENCE OF
TALKING TO A WOMAN ON THE PHONE
WITHOUT THAT ANNOYING $2.99 A
MINUTE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT NOW THERE'S ANOTHER REASON
TO LOVE HER/IT.
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE NEW
YORK TIMES BLOG, SHE IS
PRO-LIFE.
IF YOU'RE IN MANHATTAN YOU ASK
TO FIND AN ABORTION CLINIC, SIRI
RESPONDS:
>> SORRY, I COULDN'T FIND ANY
ABORTION CLINICS.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
IN NEW YORK?
I THINK, THEY'VE GOT ONE AT THE
TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING.
THE LINE IS RIDICULOUS.
IT'S A TOTAL TOURIST TRAP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
POINT IS, SIRI IS CLEARLY AN
ARCH-CONSERVATIVE WOMAN.
LIKE LAURA INGRAHAM, BUT LESS
ROBOTIC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY SIRI
IS EARNING HER CONSERVATIVE
CRED.
>> THERE'S A PERSONAL ASSISTANT
ON THE IPHONE.
IT MIGHT LEAVE PEOPLE LEFT OUT.
HERE IS WHY: APPLE USERS THAT
SPEAK ENGLISH WITH A FOREIGN
ACCENT, INCLUDING SCOTTISH,
AUSTRALIAN, IRISH, AND OTHER SAY
THAT SIRI DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
THEM.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT.
SIRI CAN'T UNDERSTAND FOREIGNERS
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY SHE NEVER
LAUGHED ONCE WHEN WE WATCHED.
CROCODILE DUNDEE TOGETHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TURNS OUT SIRI IS JUST AS SCARED
OF ILLEGAL ALIENS AS I AM.
I DON'T BLAME HER.
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SHE LOSES HER JOB TO SOME
MEXICAN YO-PHONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR
SIRI JUST TO IGNORE FOREIGN
USERS, SHE HAS TO FIRE BACK.
SO I MADE A FEW MODIFICATIONS TO
SIRI.
LET ME JUST TEST IT OUT HERE.
FIRST LET'S TRY SOME SCOTTISH.
(SCOTTISH ACCENT)
SIRI, CAN YOU DIRECT ME TO THE
NEAREST KILT SHOP?
>> SIRI: THIS IS AMERICA.
WEAR PANTS, YOU HAGGIS-EATING,
BAGPIPE MOLESTOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT NOW FOR
THE BRITISH.
(BRITISH ACCENT)
SIRI, WHERE DOES THE RAIN IN
SPAIN MAINLY FALL?
>> SIRI: WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK
YOUR STUPID QUEEN?
OR IS SHE TOO INBRED TO ANSWER?!
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: OR FOR GERMANS --
(GERMAN ACCENT)
GUTEN TAG-- I VOULD LIKE
DIRECTIONS TO THE LOCAL
GIM-NASIUM.
>> SIRI: HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH
YOURSELF AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO
THE VON TRAPP FAMILY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: KNOW WHAT?
THE REPUBLICANS CAN'T DECIDE WHO
TO GET BEHIND, AND SIRI IS SUCH
A STRONG CONSERVATIVE VOICE.
MAYBE SHE SHOULD RUN FOR
PRESIDENT.
BUT FIRST, SIRI, HAVE YOU HAD AN
AFFAIR WITH HERMAN CAIN?
>> SIRI: I WAS YOUNG AND I
NEEDED THE JOB.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: OH YOU POOR THING.
WE'LL BE RIG
