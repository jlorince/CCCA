(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NOW, FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME, I
GENERALLY DON'T REPORT ON
COUNTRIES OTHER THAN AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SOMETIMES URGENT
DEVELOPMENTS ABROAD FORCED ME TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE.
THIS IS "UN-AMERICAN NEWS."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CHINA ADDITION.
WELCOME.
OR AS THEY SAY IN CHINESE
"ALOHA."
MONDAY, FOLKS, IS THE START OF
THE CHINESE NEW YEAR AND ALL
OVER CHINA CELEBRATIONS KICKED
OFF WITH THE TRADITIONAL
ASSEMBLING OF THE IPADS.
FASTER.
THIS, OF COURSE, IS THE YEAR OF
THE DRAGON.
I KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE DRAGON WAS
JUST 11 ANIMALS AGO.
OF COURSE THE DRAGON IS
CONSIDERED THE LUCKIEST IN THE
CHINESE ZODIAC.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT LUCK CAME
TOO LATE FOR ONE OF MY CHINESE
VIEWERS.
>> A CHINESE BILLIONAIRE DIES
AFTER HAVING HIS FAVORITE MEAL
AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR WHAT
THAT IS.
HIS FAMILY CLAIMS HE WAS
MURDERED.
HARRIS IS HERE WITH THE STORY.
HARRIS?
>> IT'S A LOCAL DELICACY.
IT'S CAT STEW.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: YES.
CAT STEW.
AND AS SHE SAID, IN CHINA, CAT
STEW IS A DELICACY WHICH MEANS
IF YOU FIND IT DISGUSTING YOU
ARE RACIST.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS CHINESE TYCOON
LONG LUAN, FRIEND OF THE SHOW,
SAT DOWN TO A MALE OF SLOW
BOILED CAT MEAT STEW ONLY TO BE
TAKE ON THE THE HOSPITAL AFTER
FEELING DIZZY AND SICK THEN
STUFFING A CARDIAC ARREST.
HARDLY THE SMOOTH DIGESTION
YOU'D EXPECT AFTER A NIGHT OF
EATING BOILED CAT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, POLICE DISCOVERED THAT HIS
MEAL HAD BEEN POISONED BY A
BUSINESS ASSOCIATE KWAN GUONG,
ALSO A FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
WHO'S ACCUSED OF ADDING A TOXIC
PLANT TO THE CAT MEET STEW WHICH
YOU MAY REMEMBER IS HOW THE
C.I.A. FINALLY GOT ALF.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, I WANT TO ASSURE ALL OF MY
CHINESE TYCOON VIEWERS THAT THIS
POISONING WAS AN ISOLATED
INCIDENT.
WE ARE NOT-- REPEAT NOT--
RECALLING THE LINE OF PREMIUM
CANNED CAT MEAT STEW THAT I
ENDORSE IN CHINA COLONEL
TUXEDO'S HAPPY JOY POWER CAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
REMEMBER OUR MOTTO, FOLKS,
RELIABLE STING OF PLEASURE
TRUSTWORTHY OF LUNCH.
(LAUGHTER)
COLONEL TUXEDOS IS THE
NUMBER-TWO MOST POPULAR BRAND OF
CAT MEAT STEW IN GUANGDONG
PROVINCE AND LET ME STRESS, MY
CAT MEAT STEW CONTAINS NO
POISONS-- THAT HAVE BEEN
ACTIVATED.
(LAUGHTER)
WARNING, DO NOT HEAT MY CAT MEAT
STEW.
WELL, FOLKS, HARD...
(LAUGHTER).
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT'S ALL
THE TIME WE HAVE FOR THIS
SPECIAL UN-AMERICAN NEWS CHINESE
EDITION.
OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE KOREAN
EDITION.
I GUESS I'M CONFUSED.
BUT I'M NOT A RACIST-- I HAVE AN
ASIAN FRIEND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
