(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
"REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITHUS.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOLKS, IF
YOU WATCH THE SHOW-- AND I HOPEYOU DO-- DO YOU KNOW THAT WE AT
"THE REPORT" ARE LASER FOCUSEDON THE TRUTH.
AND THAT MEANS OBSESSIVE FACTCHECKING.
WE CHECK EVERY EPISODE AND IF WEFIND A FACT, WE REPLACE IT WITH
THE TRUTH.
(LAUGHTER)UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, NOT ALL
NEWS ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE AREUP TO OUR STANDARDS.
THERE IS A SCANDAL TEARING APARTCBS NEWS, HOME OF EDWARD R.
MURROW, WALTER CRONKITE ANDJULIE CHEN.
(LAUGHTER)SEEN HERE REPORTING ON THE
"PIRATES OF PENZANCE."
(LAUGHTER)YOU SEE, TWO WEEKS AGO, CBS
NEWS' THE "60 MINUTES" TOOK TIMEOFF FROM DOING IN-DEPTH BUDDY
CURLS WITH WOLVERINE TO BLOW THELID OFF BENGHAZI-GATE.
WHEN THE ATTACKS IN LIBYAOCCURRED, "60 MINUTES" WAS ON
THE SCENE WITHIN MINUTES OF 13MONTHS LATER.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, FOX NEWS HAS BEEN
WORKING THIS STORY FOR A YEAR,HAVING DEFINITIVELY PROVEN THAT
TRAGEDY SOMETHING SOMETHINGSOMETHING HILLARY CLINTON.
(LAUGHTER)THE ONE THING THEY DID NOT HAVE,
THE ONE THING THEY LACKED WAS ANEYEWITNESS.
WELL, TWO WEEKS AGO, THE "60MINUTES" INTERVIEWED SECURITY
CONTRACTOR MORGAN JONES.
>> MORGAN JONES' JOB WASTRAINING THE UNARMED GUARDS WHO
MANNED THE COMPOUND'S GATES.
A SECOND LIBYAN FORCE, AN ARMEDMILITIA HIRED BY THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, WAS SUPPOSED TODEFEND THE COMPOUND IN THE EVENT
OF AN ATTACK.
>> I WAS SAYING THESE GUYS ARENO GOOD, YOU NEED TO GET THEM
OUT OF HERE.
>> YOU ALSO KEPT SAYING "IF THISPLACE IS ATTACKED THESE GUYS ARE
NOT GOING TO STAND AND FIGHT."
>> YEAH, I USED TO SAY IT ALLTHE TIME.
IN THE END I GOT QUITE BORED OFHEARING MY OWN VOICE SAYING IT.
>> Stephen: DAMNING TESTIMONYFROM THE HERO WHO WAS THERE THE
NIGHT OF THE ATTACK.
>> MORGAN JONES SCALED THE12-FOOT-HIGH WALL OF THE
COMPOUND THAT WAS STILL OVERRUNWITH AL QAEDA FIGHTERS.
>> ONE GUY SAW ME.
HE -- HE JUST SHOUTED -- ICOULDN'T BELIEVE HE'D SOON ME
BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK.
HE STARTED WALKING TOWARDS ME.
>> AND AS HE WAS COMING CLOSER--
>> AS I GOT CLOSER I JUST HITHIM WITH THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE
IN THE FACE.
>> AND?
>> HE WENT DOWN.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, WHAT MOREIS THERE TO SAY THAN BENGHAZI,
BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!
>> MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTRAGE OVERTHE BENGHAZI TERROR ATTACKS BUT
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT NEW FOR YOUOUT THERE, OUR VIEWERS, BECAUSE
THE WRENCHING REPORT ON "60MINUTES" LAST NIGHT WAS FILLED
WITH INFORMATION FOX UNCOVEREDMONTHS AGO.
>> I THINK IT'S GREAT MAINSTREAMMEDIA IS FINALLY CATCHING UP.
CBS DID THIS STORY ON BENGHAZIAND I SEE CRITICISM FROM THE
LEFT WHERE THEY GO YOU GUYS ARECOVERING A PHONY SCANDAL.
"60 MINUTES" DOESN'T COVER PHONYSCANDALS.
>> Stephen: YES, ANOTHERNETWORK COVERED IT.
THAT'S HOW YOU FOE FOX NEWS'REPORTING IS ACCURATE.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S JUST LIKE THEIR MOTTO "WE
REPORT, BUT YOU SHOULD REALLYCHECK WITH SOMEONE ELSE."
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)ALSO, CBS SHOULD HAVE CHECKED
WITH SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE MORGANJONES' STORY TURNED OUT TO BE
TOTALLY FAKE.
INCLUDING HIS NAME, WHICH IS NOTMORGAN JONES BUT DYLAN DAVIES,
WHICH ACTUALLY SOUNDS EVEN MOREFAKE.
(LAUGHTER)IN FACT, IN HIS INCIDENT REPORT
TO HIS EMPLOYER DAVIES WROTE HESPENT MOST OF THE NIGHT AT HIS
BENGHAZI BEACH SIDE VILLANOWHERE NEAR THE EMBASSY.
EVIDENTLY THE GUY HE HIT IN THEFACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS RIFLE
THAT NIGHT WAS A CAB THAT BOY.
