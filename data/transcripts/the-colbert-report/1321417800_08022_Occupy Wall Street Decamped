( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE THING...
WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS NEWS TODAY,
FOLKS.
WE'RE ALL GETTING SICK OF THE
OCCUPY WIETERS.
IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS, WE GET IT.
INCOME INEQUALITY DOWN 1%, 99
RED BALLOONS GO BY.
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.
THANKFULLY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS
OCCUPY ENCAMPMENTS HAVE BEEN
DECAMPED IN PORTLAND, DENVER,
OAKLAND AND LAST NIGHT IN NEW
YORK'S ZUCOTTI PARK, OCCUPY'S
BIRTHPLACE.
PROTESTORS WERE REMOVED BY SAYS
TARN.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, MY FELLOW 1%ER NEW YORK
MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG HAD TO
TAKE ACTION.
>> FROM THE BEGINNING I'VE SAID
THAT THE CITY HAS TWO PRINCIPLE
GOALS: GUARANTEEING PUBLIC
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND
GUARANTEEING THE PROTESTERS'
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
BUT WHEN THOSE TWO GOALS CLASH,
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE
PUBLIC AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS
MUST BE THE PRIORITY.
>> Stephen: YES, TO PROTECT
EVERYONE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY
THEY SENT IN THIS GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
THERE HE IS, HELPING THE WOUNDED
AND THE SICK WITH HIS TWO
FISTS-- FLORENCE AND
NIGHTINGALE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WE'RE TAKING BLOOD DONATIONS!
AND HIS HONOR WAS CAREFUL NOT TO
VIOLATE THE PROTESTERS' FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
>> NEW YORK CITY IS THE CITY
WHERE YOU CAN COME AND EXPRESS
YOURSELF AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING
IN ZUCOTTI PARK WAS NOT THAT.
IT HAD DEVELOPED INTO A
SITUATION WHICH WAS PROHIBITING
A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM EXPRESSING
THEIR VIEWS.
>> Stephen: CLEARLY THEIR
EXPRESSION WAS PROHIBITING OTHER
EXPRESSION.
AFTER ALL, WHEN A DRUM CIRCLE
STARTS IN ZUCOTTI PARK, ALL
OTHER MUSIC IN NEW YORK STOPS.
(LAUGHTER)
BESIDES, THE FOUNDERS NEVER
INTENDED INDEFINITE FREE SPEECH.
THEY ASSUMED AFTER TWO WEEKS ANY
PROTEST WOULD BE WIPED OUT BY
SMALLPOX.
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS, LET'S REMEMBER, FOLKS,
THESE SO-CALLED PEACEFUL
PROTESTERS COULD HAVE TURNED
VIOLET LIKE THEIR FELLOW
OCCUPIERS AT U.C. BERKELEY LAST
WEEK.
LOOK AT THESE VICIOUS STUDENTS
ATTACKING THESE BILLY CLUBS WITH
THEIR SOFT, JABABLE BELLY.
(LAUGHTER)
THESE STUDENTS, OF COURSE,
NAIVELY THOUGHT THEY WERE THE
ONES BEING HELPLESSLY
TRUNCHEONED.
BUT BERKELEY CHANCELLOR ROBERT
BIRGENEAU EDUCATED THE STUDENTS
SAYING "LINKING ARMS IS NOT
NON-VIOLENT CIVIL DISOBEDIENTS."
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT.
LINKING ARMS IS A DANGEROUS ACT
OF AGGRESSION AS TAUGHT IN THE
ANCIENT MARTIAL ARTS OF RED
ROVING, SQUARE DANCING, VON
TRAPPING, AND, MOST DANGEROUS OF
ALL, YELLOW BRICK ROADING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TEAR GAS THOSE ANARCHISTS.
YOU DON'T NEED A HOUSE, MR. ,
YOU
