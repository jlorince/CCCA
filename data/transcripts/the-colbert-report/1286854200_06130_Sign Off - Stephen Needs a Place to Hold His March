>> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT
FOR "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY.
AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND
EVERYBODY, I DON'T HAVE A PLACE
TO HOLD MY RALLY YET.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
I WANTED TO HAVE MINE ON THE
MALL AND JON TOOK THE MALL.
SO IF ANYBODY LIVES IN D.C. AND
THEY HAVE PLACE FOR A COUPLE
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO
CRASH, THAT WOULD BE COOL.
WE'LL BRING OUR OWN SOAP.
