(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I HAVE TO SAY THE SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE OPENS ME LIKE A NEW SPRING ROSE.
(LAUGHTER) WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY.
NATION, IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING.
AMERICA IS FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA OF LIKING MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER) AND THAT CAN JUST GET EXACTLY ENOUGH OF HIM.
IN FACT, A GALLUP TRACKING POLL HAS HIM BEATING OBAMA BY FIVE POINTS!
AND IT MIGHT BE MORE SINCE MITT HIDES SOME OF HIS POINTS IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, FOLKS, I FOR ONE KNOW WHY AMERICA IS JUMPING ON THE ROMNEY BANDWAGON.
OR AT THE VERY LEAST BEING TIED TO THE TOP OF IT.
PEOPLE ARE FINALLY STARTING TO LEARN HOW WARM AND DOWN TO EARTH MITT REALLY IS THANKS TO THIS
INTERVIEW WITH DIANE SAWYER.
>> WHO'S FUNNIER, YOU OR SENATOR BARACK OBAMA
>> I HAVE NO IDEA HOW FUNNY HE IS IN REAL LIFE.
AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ME TEARBLY WELL FROM THE KINDS OF PRANK WES
PLAY AND WHAT IT'S LIKE IN A HOME WITH FIVE BOYS BUT MOST OF OUR DINNER TABLE EVENTS WERE
INVOLVING HUMOR OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER.
(LAUGHTER) MOST OF WHICH CAN'T BE REPEATED ON THE AIR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YES, AT HIS DINNER TABLE EVENTS HE INVOLVED HUMOR OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER.
OFTEN PRODUCING WARMTH AND FEELINGS OF ELECTABILITY.
(LAUGHTER) I THINK WE CAN ALL RELATE TO HOW HUMOR IS ENJOYABLE.
FOR INSTANCE WHEN SOMEONE DISCARDS THE CASING OF A YELLOW SKARJY FRUIT ON THE FLOOR AND
SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS NOT YOU COMES ALONG AND PERHAPS-- ETHNIC MINORITY, LET'S SAY-- AND SLIPS
CAUSING MILD INJURY AND LOSS OF DIGNITY.
THAT MAKES MY LUNG PULSATE WITH SHORT BURSTS OF AIR WITH AN "H" IN FRONT.
HA HA.
HA.
AND YOU'LL NOTICE HE SAID HIS PRANKS...
>> CAN'T BE REPEATED ON THE AIR.
>> AND WITHOUT FURTHER INFORMATION I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT INVOLVES MITT CLIMBING ON
THE TABLE AND DROPPING A DEUCE IN THE PASTA BOWL.
