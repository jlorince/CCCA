(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THIS IS THE GREATEST AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD.
NATION, THEY SAY MUSIC DOTH HAVE CHARMS TO SOOTHE THE SAVAGE BREAST.
THAT'S HOT.
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "ME TUNES." (APPLAUSE)
AS YOU CAN TELL, FOLKS, I LIVE THE ROCK AND ROLL LIFE-STYLE.
YEAH, I'LL WEAR A STRIPED TIE WITH A STRIPED SHIRT, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE MAN SAYS.
OF COURSE MY FAVORITE ROCK AND ROLLERS ARE THOSE CHEEKY BRITISH LADS WHO INVADED AMERICA SO MANY
YEARS AGO AND CHANGED MUSIC FOREVER.
I SPEAK, OF COURSE, OF DEF LEPPARD.
(LAUGHTER) UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, DUE TO A CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH THEIR
RECORD LABEL, THE LEP'S CLASSIC HITS HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE ON
INTERNET MUSIC SITES LIKE ITUNES OR... I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER ONES.
(LAUGHTER) BINGTUNES?
GOOGJAMS?
YAHOOTNANNY.
REGARDLESS.
I'M HAPPY TO SAY I CAN BANG MY DIGITAL HEAD TO DEF LEPPARD BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME UP WITH A
ROCK 'N' ROLL WORK AROUND.
JIMMY?
SCORE SOME FOOTAGE ON ME.
>> OUR WORK IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ANY DIGITAL DOMAIN BECAUSE OF
IT'S A CATALOG ISSUE WITH THE RECORD LABEL SO WE JUST WANTED STUDIO VERSIONS OF THOSE SONGS
AVAILABLE SO WE WENT IN THERE AND WE FORGED OUR OWN WORK.
>> Stephen: WHAT JOE ELLIOT IS SAYING IS TO GET AROUND A DISPUTE WITH THEIR RECORD LABEL
THEY'RE RERECORDED NOTE FOR NOTE VERSIONS OF THEIR BIGGEST HITS.
THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME FOR THE BAND WHICH IS WHY I ASSUME JOE ELLIOT HAD HIS MOM THERE FOR
MORAL SUPPORT.
(LAUGHTER) SHE LOOKS GOOD FOR A WOMAN HER AGE.
(LAUGHTER) DEF LEPPARD ISN'T DOING LAZY COVER VERSIONS OF THEIR SONGS,
THEY ARE RECREATING EVERY NUANCE.
WHICH IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF NUANCE IN DEF LEPPARD SONGS.
JOE?
TAKEN A INTERVIEW SOLO.
>> WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CARE THAT WE ACTUALLY STUDY THESE THINGS.
LITERALLY IT'S LIKE FORGERIES,
LIKE DONALD PLEASE SANS IN "THE GREAT ESCAPE" DOING THE PASSPORTS.
IT'S GOT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME TO FOOL THE GERMAN GUARD.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
EACH RECORDING WILL COME WITH A MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE GOOD ENOUGH TO FOOL A NAZI.
LET'S SEE IT'S TRUE.
JIMMY, LET'S HEAR SOME OF THE ORIGINAL 1983 REGARDING OF "ROCK OF AGES."
♪ ROCK OF AGES, ROCK OF AGES ♪
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
NOW LET'S HEAR THE ONE THEY RECORDED THIS YEAR.
♪ ROCK OF AGES... ♪
>> Stephen: (BLEEP), THAT'S AMAZING!
NOT ONLY... NOW NOT ONLY CAN THEY RELEASE THEIR MUSIC WITHOUT THEIR LABEL, I THINK IT'S SAFE
TO SAY DEF LEPPARD HAS A NEW CAREER AS THE WORLD'S BEST DEF LEPPARD COVER BAND!
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
