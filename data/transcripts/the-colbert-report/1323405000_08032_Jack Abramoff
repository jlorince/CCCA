IS.
>> WELCOME BACKS, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER
LOBBYIST WHO SERVED THREE
AND A HALF YEARS IN FEDERAL
PRISON.
I HOPE HE KNOWS THIS VISIT
IS NOT CON JU GAL.
PLEASE WELCOME JACK ABRAMOFF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
MR. ABRAMOFF, NICE TO
FINALLY MEET YOU.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: BOY OH BOY, OKAY,
SO REMIND EVERYBODY WHO JACK
ABRAMOFF IS, ALL RIGHT.
OR WAS BECAUSE YOU ARE A
CHANGED MAN, CORRECT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YES MI.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE A FORMER
LOBBYIST AND BUSINESSMAN.
YOU BECAME A POSTER BOY FOR
WASHINGTON, D.C. CORRUPTION.
YOU SERVED THREE AND A HALF
YEARS FOR FRAUD AND
CONSPIRACY AND YOUR NEW BOOK
IS CALLED CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,
THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT
WASHINGTON CORRUPTION FOR
AMERICA'S MOST NOTORIOUS
LOBBYIST.
WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE DOING
THAT MADE YOU SO NOTORIOUS?
>> WELL, I WAS A LOBBYIST
FOR OPENERS.
AND I WAS-- .
>> Stephen: THAT IS A LEGAL
ENTERPRISE IT IS LEGAL --
>> IT IS LEGAL.
>> Stephen: IT IS LEGAL TO
BE A LOBBYIST.
>> MOST OF THE NOT RYE ET
AND THINGS THAT-- NOT RIGHT
ARE LEGAL, MOST OF WHAT I
DID WAS LEGAL.
I CROSSED A FEW LINES AND
DID THINGS THAT ARE ILLEGAL,
AND WAS PUNISHED FOR IT.
>> Stephen: LIKE FOR
INSTANCE, ONE THING DID YOU
WAS YOU LOBBIED FOR INDIAN
CASINOS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BUT THEN
MISAPPROPRIATED THAT MONEY
FOR OTHER PURPOSE.
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT GOT YOU IN --
>> NOT QUITE, BUT CLOSE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU STEAL
FROM INDIANS.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: DID YOU NOT
STEAL FROM INDIANS.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THAT IS
ONE OF THE FOUNDING
PRINCIPLESES OF OUR NATION.
(APPLAUSE)
>> I GUESS THAT'S NOT A
CRIME.
THAT'S MORE OF A HISTORICAL
REENACTMENT.
I AM A HUGE FAN OF SOME OF
YOUR EARLY WORK.
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH THE
SUPREME COURT THAT MONEY
EQUALS SPEECH AND WEREN'T
YOU BY SPREADING GIFTS
AROUND CONGRESS, YOU TOOK
PEOPLE ON GOLF TRIPS.
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU DO TO
GET IN FAVOR WITH A
CONGRESSMAN OR THE
CONGRESS'S OFFICE.
>> MULES, TAKING THEM OUT
TRAVELING.
TAKE THEM TO SPORTING
EVENTS.
I BOUGHT ABOUT A MILLION AND
A HALF DOLLARS A YEAR WORTH
OF SPORTING TICKETS WHICH MY
STAFF AND I GAVE OUT TO
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND
STAFF.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT
WAS BAD WHAT YOU MR. DOING.
>> ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS BAD
ABOUT IT?
>> WHAT IS BAD IS THAT
BASICALLY WE WERE LOBBYING
AND WHAT WE WERE DOING-- .
>> Stephen: BUT LOBBYING,
LOBBYISTS INFORM MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS ABOUT THE
INDUSTRIES.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: , THE
LEGISLATION THAT CONGRESS IS
PASSING WILL AFFECT.
WHO BETTER TO WRITE OUR
LEGISLATION.
>> THAN LOBBYISTS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> INDEED.
>> Stephen: THEY KNOW WHAT
THEY ARE TALK BEING.
WE KNOW CONGRESS, THE
GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO
ANYTHING.
>> RIGHT, THEY CAN BARELY
READ THE LEGISLATION WHICH
IS ACTUALLY VERY CONVENIENT
FOR LOBBYISTS.
>> Stephen: THEY DON'T.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE TIME.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT'S REALLY
WRONG WITH IT?
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT IS
WHEN MONEY GETS INVOLVED.
WHEN A LOBBYING IS GIVING
MONEY.
LOBBYING IS FINE,
PETITIONING THE GOVERNMENT.
BUT WHEN A LOBBYIST GIVES
MONEY OR GIVES CONTRIBUTIONS
OR MEALS OR TICKETS OR
PROSTITUTES OR WHATEVER
LOBBYISTS DO, IT'S A
PROBLEM.
AND ONE GOES-- I DIDN'T GET
PROSTITUTES.
>> Stephen: I'M JUST SAYING,
THEY CAME OFF YOUR LIPS
AWFULLY QUICK, OKAY.
I TELL YOU WHAT, WE SELL
SOME BOOKS RIGHT NOW IF YOU
SAY THAT'S IN THERE.
OKAY.
BUT MONEY IS NOW OFFICIALLY
SPEECH.
WHILE YOU WERE IN JAIL THE
SUPREME COURT RULED THAT
MONEY JUST IS A-- IT'S BEEN
ENSCHRYNED AS A
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT SO I
MEAN, DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE RIDING THE WRONG
HORSE NOW?
>> WELL, I GUESS LOBBYISTS
DON'T HAVE A SPEECH
IMPEDIMENT IF MONEY IS
SPEECH.
>> Stephen: THEY DON'T, THEY
DO IT VERY ELOQUENTLY.
THEY HAVE A MEGAPHONE MADE
OF CASH.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, THAT'S THE
PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR
AMERICA AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE
WILL WAKE UP.
ONE OF THE REASONS I WROTE
THE BOOK WAS TO SHOW PEOPLE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN
WASHINGTON.
IN FACT WHAT IS GOING ON
BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS THAT
THEY CAN'T GET BEHIND,.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE MOST
CORRUPTING INFLUENCE AS YOU
SEE IT, AS CASH?
>> WELL, CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE IMMENSELY
CORRUPTING.
WHERE A LOBBYIST, FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU WERE A
CONGRESSMAN, AND NOT TO
INSULT YOU BUT YOU IF YOU
WERE A CONGRESSMAN AND I
WERE A LOBBYIST AND I WANTED
TO TAKE TO YOU DINNER AND
BUY YOU A HAMBURGER FOR $25.
>> Stephen: YES, THAT IS A
NICE HAMBURGER.
>> WELL, IT'S WASHINGTON.
SO I COULDN'T DO THAT.
YOU AND I COULDN'T HAVE THAT
MEAL.
THAT'S A GIFT TO YOU.
BUT IF I DECLARED IT AS A
FUND-RAISER AND PULLED OUT
OF MY COAT FIVE, $5,000
CHECKS AND GAVE YOU THOSE, I
COULD STILL GIVE THE
HAMBURGER AND WE COULD BE
JUST FINE.
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
IN WASHINGTON.
>> Stephen: LET ME WRITE
THIS DOWN, I CAN DO WHAT?
I CAN DO FIVE, $5,000 CHECKS
AND I GET A HAMBURGER FOR
THAT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT IS A REALLY
EXPENSIVE HAMBURGER.
NOW WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT IN
RETURN FOR THAT?
LIKE LET'S SAY THAT
HAPPENED.
THE FIVE, $5,000 CHECK, THE
MAXIMUM GIFT YOU CAN GIVE
FROM FIVE DOIFERN DIFFERENT
PEOPLE, PLUS THE HAMBURGER,
WHAT WILL YOU GET BACK FROM
A CONGRESSMAN.
>> WHAT WILL YOU GET AND
WHAT LOBBYISTS TRY GET, IS
LOYALTY ON THE PART OF THE
CONGRESSMAN TO ANYTHING THE
LOBBYIST THAT IS GOING TO
ASK FOR THAT IS REASONABLE,
QUOTE, UNQUOTE,.
>> Stephen: WELL, COME ON,
BE SPECIFIC.
WHAT DID YOU GET.
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF
SOMETHING, YOU WOULD SAY TO
YOURSELF I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT BUT I
GOT IT.
>> I GOT A MEMBER OF
CONGRESS TO INTRODUCE
LANGUAGE INTO A REFORM BILL,
OF ALL THINGS, TO ENABLE A
TRIBE IN TEXAS TO GET A
CASINO.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE ANY
PROBLEM WITH THAT.
IF-- YOU USED TO HAVE A
RESTAURANT, RIGHT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT REOPENING THAT
RESTAURANT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I HEAR THAT WAS A REALLY
NICE RESTAURANT.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN I
WAS IN PRISON I WORKED IN
THE KITCHEN FOR PART OF THE
TIME.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> SO I-- .
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A HIGH-CLASS PRISON.
WAS IT A WHITE COLLAR
PRISON.
>> THERE AREN'T ANY WHITE
COLLAR PRISONS ANY LONGER.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?
>> SOMEBODY SHOULD LOBBY TO
GET THOSE BACK.
OF COURSE THE LOBBYISTS ARE
GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT
END UP IN THERE.
MR. ABRAMOFF, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
SORRY YOU WENT TO THE OTHER
SIDE.
JACK ABRAMOFF, THE BOOK IS
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
