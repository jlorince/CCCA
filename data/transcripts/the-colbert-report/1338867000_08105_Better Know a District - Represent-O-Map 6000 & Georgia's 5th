>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK.
NATION, LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THIS SHOW KNOW THAT I OCCASIONALLY DO A SEGMENT CALLED BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHERE.
I INTERVIEW A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND THEN HERE'S THE TRICK, I SHOW IT TO YOU.
NONE OF THEM HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.
YOU SEE, WE'VE DONE 63 OF THESE SEGMENTS BUT THE PACE HAS SLOWED IN RECENT YEARS
BECAUSE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI TOLD ALL DEMOCRATS NOT TO COME ON MY SHOW.
BUT IN FEBRUARY SHE BROKE HER OWN RULE AND CAME ON MY SHOW.
TO PROMOTE HER CAMPAIGN FINANCE TRANSPARENCY BILL THE DISCLOSE ACT.
IT WAS ASH WEDNESDAY.
AND I MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.
>> IF I SPORT THE DISCLOSE ACT WILL YOU ENCOURAGE THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO DO MY BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT SERIES?
>> IT'S A DEAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT'S A DEAL.
WELL, I KEPT MY END OF THE BARGAIN BY WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTING THE DISCLOSE ACT
BECAUSE IT HAS NO CHANCE OF PASSING.
YOU SEE, THE DISCLOSE ACT WOULD REQUIRE ALL SUPER PACS TO REVEAL THEIR DONORS.
>> BILLIONAIRES AND BIG CORPORATIONS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEDDLE WITH
UNLIMITED FUNDS, ANONYMOUSLY BEHIND PHONEY SCREENS IN OUR ELECTIONS.
>> THE REAL ISSUE IF WE REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CAMPAIGN FINANCE,
REFORM IS DISCLOSURE,
DISCLOSURE, DISCLOSURE.
SUNSHINE IS WHAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM NEEDS.
>> SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT.
>> Stephen: OH, COME ON.
IF SUNLIGHT IS SUCH A GREAT DISINFECTANT THAN WHY CAN'T I EAT CHICKEN LEFT OUT ON A
PARK BENCH?
WELL, APPARENTLY, FOLKS,
REPRESENTATIVE PELOSI IS A WOMAN OF HER WORD.
BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY BOOKED TWO MORE CONGRESSMAN FOR BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT SEGMENTS THIS SUMMER.
AND TO HELP BRING IN A NEW CROP, THERE'S AN EXCITING EDITION TO COLBERT NATION.COM.
THE REPRESENTOMAP 6,000 WHERE YOU CAN GO ENCOURAGE YOUR CONGRESSMAN TO COME ON
MY SHOW THROUGH THE GROUND BREAKING TECHNIQUE OF ME TELLING YOU WITHOUT YOUR CONGRESSMAN IS.
YOU SEE, YOU JUST GO TO THE MAP, USE IT TO FIND YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND URGE THEM
TO COME ON THE REPORT BY SENDING THEM A HEARTFELT PERSONALIZED FORM LETTER.
(LAUGHTER) NOW THE REPRESENTOMAP 6,000 WAS TEST LAUNCHED EARLIER THIS SPRING WITHOUT MY
KNOWLEDGE, OR ME TELLING YOU ABOUT IT.
OR ME CALLING CONGRESS TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
>> PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE UP SET.
YOU SEE, THOUSANDS OF YOU SENT E-MAILS TO YOUR REPRESENTATIVES OR AS THE HUFFINGPO REPORTED IT,
STEPHEN COLBERT SPAMS CONGRESSIONAL PRESS SECRETARY.
AND AS EN-- ANYONE WHO HAS RECEIVED DONATION E-MAILS FROM A POLITICIAN KNOWS, YOU
DON'T SPAM THEM, THEY SPAM YOU.
(LAUGHTER) ANYWAY--  (APPLAUSE) ANYWAY, GOOD NEWS IS THE SITE IS BACK UP.
SO I ENCOURAGE ALL OF TO YOU GO TO COLBERT NATION.COM,
URGE YOUR CONGRESSMAN TO COME ON MY SHOW.
BUT THERE'S ONE REPRESENTATIVE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO URGE BECAUSE HE IS MY GUEST TONIGHT.
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE 64th INSTALLMENT OF MY 434 PART SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT.
TONIGHT, THE FIGHTING FIFTH,
THE FIFTH DISTRICT IS LOCATED IN AND AROUND THE GREAT CITY OF ATLANTA.
AND IS HOME TO THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL.
WHICH SPONSORS THE ANNUAL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T TAKE-YOUR-DAUGHTER-TO-WORK DAY.
(LAUGHTER) PERHAPS THE FIFTH MOST FAMOUS RESIDENT WAS CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR..
AT LAST COUNT DR. KING HAD 730 STREET ITS NAMED AFTER HIM IN AMERICA.
SECOND ONLY TO RIVAL CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER THE REVEREND DOCTORS MAYNARD MAIN STREET.
GOOD MAN.
THE FIFTH IS ALSO HOME TO THE COCA-COLA CORPORATION,
WHOSE HEADQUARTERS INCLUDE A COCA-COLA MUSEUM.
WHICH TRAGICALLY IS LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO THE POP ROCK MUSEUM.
SO WHO IS THE REAL THING TO REPRESENT SUCH A DISTRICT?
NONE OTHER THAN 13 TERM CONGRESSMAN AND CIVIL RIGHT ITS PIONEER JOHN LEWIS.
I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE LEWIS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE HE IS MY
