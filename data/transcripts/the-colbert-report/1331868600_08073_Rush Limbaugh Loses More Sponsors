( APPLAUSE )
WARPING.
YOU'VE BEEN WANDER.
NATION, THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT
HAS BECOME A CUDGEL AGAINST THE
REPUBLICANS THERE THIS CAMPAIGN.
IT'S CONTRACEPTION, AND I AM
TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT IT.
SO INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO MIME
ABOUT IT.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE )
ANOTHER NOW I CAN TALK ABOUT IT
AGAIN.
THIS IS A PALETTE CLEANSER.
(  LAUGHTER  )
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT
THIS SO-CALLED CONTROVERSY.
BECAUSE IT'S THREATENING THE
LIVELIHOODHOOD OF RADIO HOST AND
TATER-TOT IN CASUAL WEAR, RUSH
LIMBAUGH.
>> THE ADVERTISERS FLEEING FROM
RUSH LIMBAUGH IS GROWING.
141 COMPANIES HAVE OFFICIALLY
BAILED ON LIMBAUGH'S RADIO SHOW.
AMONG THE LATEST, ACURA, I.B.M.,
AMERICAN EXPRESS, McDONALD'S
AND THE U.S. ARMY.
>> Stephen:  YES, THE ARMY IS
PULLING OUT OF RUSH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
MEANWHILE--
( APPLAUSE )
MEANWHILE, THEY'RE STAYING IN
AFGHANISTAN TO NEGOTIATE WITH
THE TALIBAN WHO EVIDENTLY HAVE A
BETTER TRACK RECORD ON WOMEN'S
ISSUES.
(  LAUGHTER  )
AND NOW, PREMIERE RADIO NETWORK
WHICH SYNDICATES EL-RUSH-BO, HAS
CANCELED ALL ITS NATIONAL AD
SPOTS FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
WHICH IS ITS SOLE SOURCE OF
REVENUE FOR THE SHOW.
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD,
FOLKES, RUSH MAY HAVE TO START A
PLEDGE DRIVE.
LADIES, DONATE NOW, AND WILL GET
THIS FREE TOTE BAG, PUT ALL
YOUR-- PUT ALL YOUR FLUFF STUFF
IN THERE.
( APPLAUSE )
FOR THE WALK OF SHAME.
AND, FOLKS, THESE ACCUSATIONS OF
SEXISM ARE TOTALLY UNFAIR TO
RUSH.
JUST ASK RUSH.
>> YOU HOCAN I BE ANTI-WOMEN?
I EVEN JUDGED THE MISS AMERICA
PAGEANT.
>> Stephen:  YES!
WHAT MORE DOES HE HAVE TO DO,
JUDGE PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR?
( APPLAUSE )
PLUS, RUSH IS JUST EXERCISING
HIS RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.
AND WHILE IT IS SHOCKING THAT
RUSH WOULD EXERCISE ANYTHING,
THIS IS AMERICA.
WE MUST DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE
SYMBOLIZED BY LADY LIBERTY,
UNLESS SHE'S ON THE PILL, WHICHN
WHICH CASE SHE IS A GIANT, GREEN
TRAMP.
OH, SHE'LL LIFT HER LAMP AND
OPEN HER GOLDEN DOOR FOR
ANYBODY.
YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR, AND NOT
JUST ONE-ON-ONE.
SHE'LL TAKE ON HUDDLED MASSES.
EVERYBODY LINE UP FOR A PEEK
UNDER HER TOGA.
THE REAL VICTIM-- THE REAL
VICTIM HERE IS RUSH.
THIS WHOLE BIRTH CONTROL
CONTROVERSY STARTED WITH THAT
GEORGETOWN LAW STUDENT, SANDRA
FLUKE.
WHOSE TESTIMONY WAS NO FLUKE.
>> JIM, TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO
CONNECT THE DOTS FOR YOU.
>> FOLLOW ME HERE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE ROPES
WITH THE ECONOMY AND
SPECIFICALLY WITH WOMEN VOTERS,
GETS MRS.  FLUKE TO CREATE A
CONTROVERSY, AND THE LIBERAL
MAINSTREAM MEDIA PUPPETS PLAY
ALONG AS SCRIPTED.
>> IT'S ALL PART OF A PLAN.
IT IS NOT ACCIDENTAL.
NONE OF THIS STUFF JUST
HAPPENED.
WHOA!
LOOKIE OVER THERE WHAT JUDD
HAPPENED.
IT'S ALL ORCHESTRATED.
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND,
IN MY INVESTIGATOR'S MIND, THAT
THIS WOMAN FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING WAS WHAT THEY CALL
"RUN" BY VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE.
>> OH, YEAH SHE'S AWE PAWN.
>> Stephen:  OH, YEAH, SHE WAS
RUN BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.
SHE'S A PAWN.
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE
THAT A 30-YEAR-OLD WOMAN HAD HER
OWN THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS?
( LAUGHTER )
COME ON.
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
