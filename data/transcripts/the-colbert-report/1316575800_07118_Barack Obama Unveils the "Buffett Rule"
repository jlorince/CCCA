I TAKE IT ALL BACK.
THAT MAGGIE SMITH CAN ACT.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, THERE'S ONE
FOREIGNERS REALLY ROBBING
AMERICA-- BARACK OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER)
YESTERDAY OBAMA UNVEILED HIS
DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN WITH YET
ANOTHER FIERY SPEECH FROM THE
ROSE GARDEN.
I AM BEGINNING TO THINK HE HAS
LOCKED HIMSELF OUT OF THE WHITE
HOUSE AND IS AFRAID TO ADMIT HE
CAN'T FIND HIS KEYS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, YOU DON'T TO BE A ROCKET
SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
U.S. NEEDS MONEY.
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE HAVE
LAID OFF ALL OF OUR ROCKET
SCIENTISTS.
(LAUGHTER)
BY TAXING THE RICH, THERE IS A
NAME FOR WHAT OBAMA IS TRYING TO
DO HERE.
>> WHEN YOU PICK ONE AREA OF THE
ECONOMY AND YOU SAY WE'RE GOING
TO TAX THOSE PEOPLE-- BECAUSE
MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT THOSE
PEOPLE-- THAT'S CLASS WARFARE.
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MOVE
DOWN THE CLASS WARFARE PATH.
>> I DON'T THINK I WOULD
DESCRIBE CLASS WARFARE AS LEADER
>> Stephen: YES!
IT IS CLASS WARFARE!
AND THAT IS UNFAIR FOR RICH
PEOPLE WHO, GENERALLY SPEAKING,
WOULD PREFER NOT TO FIGHT OUR
WARS.
(LAUGHTER)
MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT OBAMA
DENIES HIS TAX THE WEALTHY PLAN
IS EVEN WAR.
>> THIS IS NOT CLASS WARFARE.
IT'S MATH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SINCE WHEN DOES MATH
SETTLE ANYTHING?
LIKE EVOLUTION, I BELIEVE MATH
IS JOOUS A THEORY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND DEMONIZING THE WEALTHY IS
NOT WHAT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS.
JUST ASK G.O.P. ECONOMIST GURU
PAUL RYAN.
>> IF YOU TAX SOMETHING MORE YOU
GET LESS OF IT.
IF YOU TAX JOB CREATORS MORE,
YOU GET LESS JOB CREATION.
>> Stephen: YES!
JOB CREATORS LIKE ME NEED LOW
TAXES SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO
CREATE JOBS!
JUST LOOK AT HISTORY.
IN 1995, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE
PAID BY MILLIONAIRES WAS 30.4%.
BY 2009 IT HAD DROPPED TO 22.4%.
AND OVER THAT SAME PERIOD,
UNEMPLOYMENT PLUMMETED FROM 5.6%
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 9.3%.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I PROMISE... I PROMISE
THERE IS MORE JOBS COMING!
JUST BE PATIENT.
WE JOB CREATORS ARE LIKE A SLOT
MACHINE.
IF WE JUST KEEP PUMPING IN TAX
CUTS, EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO
PAY OFF!
YOU CAN'T QUIT NOW, YOU'VE GOT
US ALL WARMED UP.
BUT THE MOST FRIGHTENING ASPECT
OF OBAMA'S PLAN IS THAT IT MIGHT
BE POPULAR, A RECENT CNN POLL
SHOWS 63% OF PEOPLE THINK TAXES
SHOULD BE RAISED ON HIGH-INCOME
AMERICANS AND CORPORATIONS.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
IF WE RAISE TAXES ON
CORPORATIONS, WHAT INCENTIVE
WILL THEY HAVE TO MAKE MONEY
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT
