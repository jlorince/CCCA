[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WOO!

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOVELY, THAT'S LOVELY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT BEGUN
EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AS YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE ARE
LOVING STEVE FEST COBECELLA-011.
LET ME START BY SAYING --
[LAUGHTER]
SOME OF YOU YOU MAY UNDERSTAND
THAT.
FOLKS BRRK WE GET TO THE ROCK
'N' ROLL, NATION, SOME NEWS TO
TOUCH ON.
NATION, THE REPUBLICAN RACE FOR
2012 IS HEATING UP.
TODAY, FORMER OBAMA AMBASSADOR
TO CHINA.
AND CURRENT CREST WHITE STRIPS
AFTER-PHOTO JON HUNTSMAN GOT IN
THE RACE.
JIM?
>> I'M JON HUNTSMAN, AND I'M
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WE'RE NOT JUST CHOOSING NEW
WE'RE NOT JUST CHOOSING NEW
LEADERS.
WE'RE CHOOSING WHETHER WE ARE TO
BE YESTERDAY'S STORY OR
TOMORROW'S.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE JON
HUNTSMAN INTENDS TO BE
TOMORROW'S STORY.
BECAUSE FOR HIM, YESTERDAY'S
STORY IS, "HEY, I WORK FOR
BARACK OBAMA."
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEN HUNTSMAN PERFECTLY
DESCRIBED TRUE AMERICANS.
>> PEOPLE SECURE IN THEIR RIGHTS
AND IN LOVE WITH THEIR LIBERTY.
>> Stephen: YES, I'M
PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH MY
LIBERTY!
I'D SAY I LUST FOR IT.
[LAUGHTER]
WE HAVE A VERY VIGOROUS PHYSICAL
RELATIONSHIP.
LIBERTY AND I.
SOMETIMES WE ROLE PLAY.
SHE DRESSES UP AS SOCIALISM AND
I SPANK HER WITH A ROLLED-UP
CONSTITUTION.
[LAUGHTER]
AND EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESN'T
ALWAYS REACH HAPPINESS, SHE'S
ASSURED ME THAT JUST PURSUING IT
IS GOOD ENOUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO I LIKE HIM.
ONLY PROBLEM IS, HUNTSMAN HAS A
FACE AND A NAME. AND RIGHT NOW,
OBAMA LEADS ALL
SPECIFIC REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
IN THE POLLS, EVEN BEATING
THE ROMNEY.
THANKFULLY, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
A DARK HORSE.
>> THE LATEST GALLUP POLL HAS
PRESIDENT OBAMA NARROWLY LOSING
TO A GENERIC REPUBLICAN.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA FALLING
BEHIND A GENERIC REPUBLICAN
CHALLENGER INTO A NEW POLL 39%
TO 44%.
>> REPUBLICANS LEAD BY A FEW
POINTS ON THE GENERIC
PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT.
A GENERIC REPUBLICAN, IF YOU
FIND THAT PERSON, BEATING
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Stephen: GUESS WHAT?
I FOUND THAT PERSON ON MY WAY TO
WORK THIS MORNING.
[LAUGHTER]
REPUBLICAN PARTY, SAY HELLO TO
YOUR GENERIC PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
STRONG STRIDE, WELL KNOWN, PLUS
HE'S A FAMILY MAN.
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE
BRIEFCASE, HE'S GOT BUSINESS
EXPERIENCE.
BUT HE'S ALSO WORKED BLUE-COLLAR
JOBS.
THIS GUY HAS SOMETHING FOR
EVERYBODY.
HE'S WELL-READ.
HE'S OUTDOORSY.
AND HE LOVES THE FLAG.
OR RECTANGLES.
AND HE'S GOT A VERY COMPELLING
PERSONAL STORY.
HE WAS A PROMISING YOUNG
[LAUGHTER]
ATHLETE, WHO GOT A LITTLE DRUNK
ONE NIGHT SLIPPED AND FELL
[LAUGHTER]
WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR FOR A WHILE,
BUT GOT BACK ON HIS FEET AND
NOW, HE HOLDS A WORLD RECORD IN
RUNNING DOWN STAIRS PAST FIRES.
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS, HE'D REALLY HELP OUR
RELATIONS WITH CHINA.
AFTER ALL, HIS NAME IS
PED XING.
[LAUGHTER]
I GOTTA SAY, FOLKS,
THE ONLY KNOCK ON THIS GUY,
OTHER THAN HIS HEAD NOT BEING
ATTACHED TO HIS BODY, IS THAT
REPUBLICANS DON'T NEED ANOTHER
CANDIDATE WHO SPENDS A
SUSPICIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME
HANGING AROUND MENS' ROOMS.
[LAUGHTER]
