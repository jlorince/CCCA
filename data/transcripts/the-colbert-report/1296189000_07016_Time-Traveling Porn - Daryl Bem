(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SPEAK FING
PREDICTIONS, FOLKS, LET'S DO
A LITTLE TEST RIGHT NOW.
EVERYONE HERE, EVERYONE IN
THE STUDIO AUDIENCE WHO CAME
TO SEE ME ON MY SHOW I WANT
YOU TO CONCENTRATE ON ME AND
THINK OF A FAMOUS PERSON,
OKAY.
DON'T TELL ME WHO IT IS.
LOOK AT ME.
THINK OF A FAMOUS PERSON.
IS IT ME?
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OH, WOW.
DID ANYONE ELSE JUST GET
CHILLS?
AND IT APPEARS I AM NOT
ALONE IN POSSESSING SENSES
HINDSIGHT, HEARING AND THE
OTHER ONE.
ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY
CORNELL PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR
DARYL BELL SOONED TO BE PUB
LUSHED IN THE JOURNAL OF
PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL
PSYCHOLOGY THERE IS QUOTE
STRONG EVIDENCE FOR EXTRA
SENSORY PERCEPTION, THE
ABILITY TO SENSE FUTURE
EVENTS.
I KNOW ARE YOU THINKING
STEPHEN, THAT'S BULL
[BLEEP].
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I KNOW
YOU'RE THINKING STEPHEN,
THAT'S BULL [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER)
IN HIS LATEST STUDY
PROFESSOR BEM PAID 100
COLLEGE STUDENTS $5 EACH TO
SIT IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER
SCREEN WHICH DISPLAYED TWO
CURTAINS.
THEY WERE TOLD AN IMAGE
WOULD APPEAR BEHIND ONE OF
THE CURTAINS AND ASKED TO
PREDICT WHICH ONE.
IT'S JUST LIKE YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S OL GAME WHICH
HAND IS HIDING THE QUARTER
EXCEPT IN THIS CASE GRANDPA
GETS TENURE.
NOW WHEN THE IMAGE WAS
NEUTRAL, SUBJECTS WERE
AUTOMOBILE TO PREDICT WHICH
SIDE IT WOULD APPEAR ON
49.8% OF THE TIME.
STATISTICALLY RANDOM.
BUT WHEN THE IMAGE IS ABOUT
TO BE REVEALED WERE HE ROTIC
IN NATURE-- EROTIC,
PARTICIPATES WERE ABLE TO
CORRECT THE CORRECT SIDE
58.1% OF THE TIME APPARENTLY
WHEN IT COMES TO PREDICTING
THE FUTURE, WE LIKE TO
WATCH.
PROFESSOR BEM SUGGESTS THAT
SUBJECT APPROXIMATES WERE
ABLE TO SENSE THE SMUT
THANKS TO SOMETHING CALLED
RETROACTIVE INFLUENCE.
MEANING THE PLEASURE OF
LOOKING AT NAUGHTY PHOTOS IS
SO GREAT IT RIPPLES
BACKWARDS FROM THE FUTURE TO
INFLUENCE US IN THE PRESENT.
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
SCIENCE HAS FINALLY DISCOVERED
TIME TRAVEL PORN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IF THE FLUX CAPACITORS
ARE ROCKING DON'T COME A
KNOCKING.
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON I
WAS THINKING ABOUT SEX ALL
THE TIME.
CLEARLY PORN'S BEEN
TRAVELING BACKWARDS THROUGH
TIME INTO MY BRAIN.
NOW LET ME TELL YOU BASED ON
WHAT I THINK ABOUT, SOME OF
THE SEX OF THE FUTURE IS
PRETTY FREAKY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW PROFESSOR
BEM'S THEORY OF EXTRA
SENSORY PORNCEPTION IS
HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL.
THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON
PSYCHOLOGIST RAY HYMAN CALLS
BEM'S METH FLAWS.
HIS RESULTS UNRELIABLE AND
CALLED HIS ARTICLE AN
EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE ENTIRE
FIELD.
YES, IT IS A TRUE STAIN ON
THE KILLING ANY FIND FIELD
OF PAYING COLLEGE KIDS $5 TO
LOOK AT PORN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, I SAY
RATHER THAN FEARING TIME
TRAVELING PORN, WE SHOULD
USE ITS POWER FOR GOOD.
WHICH IS WHY I WILL NOW USE
IT TO PREDICT WHOSE'S
GOINGING TO WIN THE 2012
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE WINNER WILL
BE NATIONALLY PORTMAN AND
MILA KUNIS.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I ALSO HAVE THEM
WINNING THE SUPER BOWL, AND
PERFORMING AT THE HALFTIME
SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: POWERFUL STUFF.
I JUST WISH PROFESSOR BEM
WERE HERE TO EXPLAIN IT TO
ME.
WAIT, I'M SENSING A
PRESENCE.
IT'S, YES, JOINING ME NOW,
PROFESSOR DARYL BEM,
PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR ABOUT GOING TO
HAVE SPOKEN TO ME.
YOU WILL HAVE BEEN A GREAT
GUEST.
NOW HOW IS THIS WORKING?
HOW IS THIS WORKING THAT
THESE WAVES OF INFLUENCE ARE
COMING FROM THE FUTURE TO
SHOW US THE NAUGHTY PARTS?
>> WE HAVE NO IDEA.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> I GUESS WHAT MADE YOU
THINK TO EVEN TRY THIS?
>> DID YOU JUST HAVE COLLEGE
STUDENTS AND YOU THOUGHT
WHAT CAN I SHOW THEM THAT
WOULD RAISE EYEBROWS IF?
>> NO, THE BELIEF THAT THE
FUTURE CAN BE DETECTED GOES
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE OLD
TESTAMENT.
>> OF COURSE.
>> AND ABOUT 60% OF
AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THERE
ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN DO THIS.
>> RIGHT.
>> AND MOST PSYCHOLOGISTS
SAY IT'S NONSENSE LIKE RAY
HYMAN.
>> RIGHT.
>> SO IT INTRIGUED ME TO
SHOW IN THE LABORATORY
WHETHER WE COULD ACTUALLY
FIND IT AND JUST UNSELECTED
PEOPLE.
>> DUE DID YOU REALLY SHOW
ANYTHING?
IT'S 53%.
IS THAT NOT THAT BIG OF A
DIFFERENCE FROM 50%.
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY
ARE DEMONSTRATING SOMETHING
WITH THAT?
>> WELL, 53% SOUNDS SMALL
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE
AMOUNT THAT A CASINO HAS
OVER YOU IN ROULETTE WHEEL.
>> Stephen: IT'S A 53%
ADVANTAGE.
>> YES, OVER-- YOU WIN 47%
OF THE TIME AND THEY WIN 53%
OF THE TIME IN A ROULETTE
WHEEL.
53% IS WHAT OBAMA WON OVER
McCAIN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,
ARE YOU SAYING THAT OBAMA IS
A TIME TRAVELING
PORNOGRAPHER?
THAT'S WHY HE WON'T SHOW US
THE BIRTH CERTIFICATES.
BECAUSE THE DATE IS FROM THE
FUTURE.
>> RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT IT SAYS, WHAT IT
TELLS US IS PEOPLE DIDN'T
JUST GO INTO THE BOOTH AND
FLIP A COIN BECAUSE THAT 53%
IS ACTUALLY QUITE LARGE.
IT'S ALSO THE SIZE OF THE
COLBERT BUMP, CANDIDATES WHO
APPEAR ON THIS PROGRAM HAVE
A 3% ADVANTAGE OVER THOSE
WHO DO NOT.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO 3% IS THE
COLBERT BUMP, YOU SHOW ME
SOME PORNOGRAPHY, IT MIGHT
GET BIGGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I GOT TO ASK WHY DID YOU SAY
I'LL SHOW PORNOGRAPHY.
I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
WHY NOT SOMETHING ELSE LIKE
INTERESTING LIKE FOOD
REQUEST.
WHY DID YOU SHOW PORN OG
FEELING?
>> IT'S BASED ON PREVIOUS
EXPERIMENTS BY OTHER
RESEARCHERS WHO SHOW THAT IF
YOU ARE SHOWING PEOPLE
PICTURES THEY JUST SIT THERE
AND WATCH THEM AND MEASURE
THEIR PHYSIOLOGY WITH WITH
THE LIE DETECTING KINDS OF
EQUIPMENT.
THAT THEIR AROUSEAL, NOT
SEXUAL AROUSEAL, NECESSARILY,
BUT JUST AROUSEAL OF THE
PHYSIOLOGY, OBVIOUSLY GOES
UP WHEN THEY SEE A
PORNOGRAPHIC PICTURE.
BUT ITS AMAZING THING IS IT
GOES UP 2 TO 10 SECONDS
BEFORE THE PICTURE APPEARS,
BEFORE THE COMPUTER IS EVEN
DECIDED WHETHER IT IS GOING
TO BE A PORNOGRAPHIC PICTURE
OR NOT.
>> IN YOUR EXPERIMENT.
>> THAT WAS THE ONE THAT
PRECEDED IT.
THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO DO
PAIN.
>> YOUR BODY WOULD KNOW THAT
PORN WAS COMING.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BEFORE IT
ACTUALLY APPEARED ON THE
SCREEN.
>> EVOLUTIONARILY THAT WOULD
BE WONDERFUL.
>> Stephen: SO WHY DO YOU
THINK THIS IS HAPPENING?
IF YOU HAD A THEORY, WHAT
WOULD YOU SAY IT IS?
>> ACTUALLY THE THEORY WE'RE
LOOKING TOWARD IS QUANTUM
PHYSICS, YOUR NEXT GUEST.
>> Stephen: BRIAN GREENE,
YEAH, YEAH.
AND ANYONE WHO HAS LIVED
THROUGH THE 20th CENTURY AS
A PHYSICIST IS ACCUSTOMED TO
SEEING PHENOMENON THAT ARE
JUST AS WEIRD AS THE
PHENOMENON I'M SHOWING BUT
PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED
IN PORN.
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE AS MUCH
MATHEMATICS.
>> Stephen: DOCTOR, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
