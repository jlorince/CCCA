THAT IS GROUNDBREAKING -- IT'SLIKE A SELFIE OF SOMEONE ELSE!
PLEASE WELCOME J.R.!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
>> Stephen: J.R., THANK YOUFOR COMING ON!
SIT DOWN!
NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAYNOT KNOW, I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE
I WAS INTRODUCED TO YOU, YOU AREA SEMI-ANONYMOUS FRENCH STREET
ARTISTS, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT, WE'LL SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE INSTALLEDWORK IN PARIS, THE MIDDLE EAST
AND THE LARGEST ILLEGALPHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION ALSO THE
WINNER OF THE 2011 TED PRIZE.
WHEN YOU SAY SEMIANONYMOUS,BECAUSE YOU LET PEOPLE SEE YOU
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY YOURNAME OR LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU
ARE?
>> I STARTED FROM GRAFFITI, SOMOST OF WHAT I DID WAS NOT
REALLY LEGAL(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SO ARE YOU A"CRIMINAL"?
>> DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRYYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT THEUNITED STATES?
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS BEENNICE TO ME, FOR NOW.
>> Stephen: YOU DO LIKE TOHIDE YOUR IDENTITY?
>> LET'S SAY WHEN YOU DRAW APORTRAIT ON THE WALL IN CHINA,
YOU BETTER NOT PUT YOUR NAME ONTHE WALL.
>> Stephen: WE WILL NOT REVIEWYOUR TRUE NAME AND HAVE
DISGUISED YOUR VOICE WITH THATOUTRAGEOUS ACCENT
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LET'S EXPLAIN TO THEPEOPLE SOME OF THE ART YOU DO.
JIM, LET'S SEE IF ART HERE.
THIS IS AN INSTALLATION YOU DIDIN RIO DE JANEIRO?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S BEING DONEHERE?
>> THIS IS IN A PROVINCE IN RIO,AND THOSE ARE FACES AND EYES OF
WOMEN FROM THE COMMUNITY, THATARE THE PILLARS OF THEIR
COMMUNITY, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK INTHE MIDDLE, YOU ONLY SEE
VIOLENCE.
>> Stephen: VERY DANGEROUS.
IT IS, BUT ABOUT 80% OF THEPOPULATION ARE HAVING A NORMAL
LIFE.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT.
THIS IS BRAZIL.
>> Stephen: ALL THESE WOMEN'SFACES. WHY WOMEN?
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN I WASLOOKING AT TV, ALL I WAS SEEING
WAS MEN WITH GUNS AND DRUGS,AND WHEN I WENT THERE, I
ACTUALLY SAW WOMEN CARRYINGTHEIR COMMUNITY, CARRYING THEIR
CHILDREN.
>> Stephen: THESE ARE ORDINARYPEOPLE
(APPLAUSE)WHY NOT -- THESE ARE ORDINARY
PEOPLE.
WHY NOT TAKE PICTURES OF FAMOUSPEOPLE OR CELEBRITIES?
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE, A, WE KNOW HOW TO GET
PHOTOGRAPHED AND, B, PEOPLE LOVELOOKING AT US.
EVEN SHAKESPEARE WROTE ABOUTKINGS AND QUEENS.
WHY MAKE YOUR ART ABOUT ORDINARYFOLKS THAT NOBODY LOOKS AT?
>> WHEN I WENT THERE FIRST, IDIDN'T SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T INVITEME
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S ANOTHER ONE YOU DID, THIS
IS BETWEEN THE WEST BANK ANDISRAEL.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THESE AREPHOTOGRAPHS OF ISRAELIS AND
PALESTINIANS DOING THE EXACTSAME JOB.
SO THESE GUYS MIGHT HAVE THESAME JOB ON EITHER SIDE OF THE
WALL.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
(LAUGHTER)>> SO, BASICALLY, IMAGINE I TAKE
A STEPHEN COLBERT IN PALESTINEAND IN ISRAEL, BOTH ARE DOING
THE SAME JOB -->> Stephen: TWO OF ME.
SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR
ONE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. I PUTTHEM IN THE STREET.
I SAY, WHO IS WHO?
AND MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLECANNOT RECOGNIZE WHO IS THE
ISRAELI AND WHO IS THEPALESTINIAN.
>> Stephen: YOU TELL ME WHATSIDE THEY'RE ON, I'LL TELL YOU
WHO'S RIGHT(LAUGHTER)
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU CANJUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER?
>> NOT EXACTLY.
I THINK I'M SAYING THAT THEENEMY ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHO WE
THINK THEY ARE.
THESE PEOPLE HAVE CRAZY PICTURESAND WHEN YOU PLACE IT RIGHT IN
FRONT OF THEIR FACE, THERE'S NOTTHAT MUCH DIFFERENCE.
SO AN ISRAELI AND PALESTINIANSIN DIFFERENT PLACES, IT'S ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL.
BUT PEOPLE HELP YOU TO DO IT
>> Stephen: SO PEOPLE LIKE THIS?
FIRST, I DIDN'T GET KILLED, ICAME BACK ALIVE
PEOPLE, WHEN I CAME BACK HERE,THEY TOLD ME, YOU'RE SO BRAVE
PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOOT YOU
>> Stephen: DID THEY TOUCH YOUTHE WHOLE TIME YOU TALKED?
THE FUNNY THING, STEPHEN, IS ITWAS THE EASIEST [BLEEP] THING
EVER. I EVEN GOT SUN BURNED. IWENT ON HOLIDAY, CAME BACK.
I SAID I'M NOT THE HERO, THEPEOPLE, THEY'RE THE ONE WITH
THEIR FACE ON THE WALL WHILE I'MHERE HAVING A DRINK WITH YOU.
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE PROBLEM.YOU WANT TO HUMANIZE THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE BEING AFFECTED BY WAR,IN THIS CASE, OR THESE ARE SOME
PEOPLE -- GO TO THE NEXT ONE,JIM -- THESE ARE PEOPLE INSPIRED
BY YOU AND APPROVED BY YOU INPAKISTAN WHO PUT UP THE FACE OF
A LITTLE GIRL, A GIANT PORTRAITTHEY MADE IN A FIELD TO SHOW
DRONE OPERATORS THAT PEOPLE LIVE HERE -- TO SHOW THEM WHO
LIVES HERE? BECAUSE THIS IS ANAREA THAT GETS DRONED BY
THE U.S., RIGHT?
EXACTLY, I THINK THE BEAUTY OFTHAT PROJECT IS FIRST,
I WENT TO PAKISTAN AND I NEVERHAD DRONES FLYING OVER MY HEAD.
ALL I KNOW IS I WAS THE GUYFLYING THE DRONE, IF I CAN'T SEE
THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE I'MFLYING ABOVE, I CAN'T REALIZE
THE DAMAGE I'M DOING. THEYPRINTED IT THEMSELVES.
LET ME FINISH, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  WHY CAN'T I START?
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ONLY IF IT'SART AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID AND
PRINTED IT THEMSELVES.
AND IT'S BEEN PRINTED BYHUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
AROUND THE WORLD AND THE MEDIA.
>> Stephen: SEEMS WHAT YOU'RESAYING HERE IS THAT I HAVE TO
CONSIDER EVERY PERSON AS HUMAN.
(LAUGHTER)THAT I CAN'T JUST THINK OF
PEOPLE AS PART OF A POPULATIONOR A STATISTIC.
SO THERE'S NOBODY I CAN'TACCIDENTALLY KILL IN A WAR AND
STILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT WAR.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHATYOU'RE SAYING
YOU 'RE SAYING ANYBODY WHODIES IN A WAR THAT'S JUSTIFIED,
I HAVE TO GRIEVE OVER?
>>NO, I'M JUST SAYING-->> Stephen:  OH I DON'T HAVE TO?
>>NO THE QUESTION THAT'SRAISED IS, THE FACT THAT
IT WENT SO FAR AND WE'RE HERETALKING ABOUT THIS, AS AN ARTIST
YOU ASK QUESTIONS, YOU DON'TGIVE THE ANSWERS SO I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE CONFLICTED HERE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF
US. YOU ASK QUESTIONS THAT DON'TGIVE ANSWERS.
I DON'T WANT ANY QUESTIONS, I'LLTELL YOU THE ANSWER.
ARTIST, PUNDIT.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: WE GO WELLTOGETHER.
J.R., EVERYBODY!
