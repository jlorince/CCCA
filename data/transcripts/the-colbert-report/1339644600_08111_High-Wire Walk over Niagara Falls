( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
HOW ARE YOU OVER THERE?
ARE THEY OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY OVER THERE?
EVERYTHING GOOD?
COME ON!
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
( CHEERS ) LET ME JUST BE THE FIRST TO SAY DOMINUS LOBISKUM.
ANOTHER NATION, IT IS NO SECRET THAT AMERICA'S SMALL TOWNS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE RUST BELT, ARE STRUGGLING.
IT'S GOATEN SO BAD THAT THE PROM THEME OF MANY SMALL HIGH SCHOOLS
IS-- "ENCHANTMENT UNDER THE OVERPASS." AND NO ONE IS STRUGGLING MORE
THAN NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK,
HOME TO A BREATH TAKING AND MAJESTIC CASCADE OF CRUSHING POVERTY.
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST CENSUS,
TWO OUT OF THREE RESIDENTS SUBSIST ON WELFARE OR SOCIAL SECURITY.
SO IF YOU SEE SOMEONE THERE IN A BARREL, HE'S NOT ABOUT TO GO OVER THE FALLS.
THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES.
( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE TOWN HAS FOUND A SAVIOR FROM ABOVE.
>> SUSPENDED 200 FEET IN THE AIR.
ON A WIRE OVER NIAGARA FALLS.
THAT'S 20 STORIES HIGH.
RAGING WATERS BELOW.
FRIDAY NIGHT, JUNE 15, DAREDEVIL NICK WELLINDA WILL ATTEMPT ONE OF THE GREATEST STUNTS OF ALL
TIMES, CROSSING HIGH OVER NIAGARA FALLS ON A WIRE, ALL IN THE DARK OF NIGHT.
ALL THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING.
HOLD YOUR BREATH GRAY HIGH-WIRE WALK ACROSS NIAGARA FALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
THIS COULD BE THE MOST LIFE-THREATENING EVENT ON NETWORK TELEVISION SINCE ANY FOOTBALL GAME.
( LAUGHTER ).
NICK WELL ENDA, OF THE FLYING WELL ENDAS WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON EVER TO CROSS THE MIGHTY
FALLS ON A TIGHTROPE.
HE RECEIVED AN EXCEPTION TO THE FALL'S "NO STUNT" POLICY THANKS
TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY'S SLUGGISHNESS.
NOW, PHOBS, YOU KNOW A TOWN IS IN BAD SHAPE WHEN THEY HAVE TO CREATE A TOURIST ATTRACTION TO
ATTRACT TOURISTS TO THEIR TOURIST ATTRACTION.
AND WITH THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHING THIS INCREDIBLE STUNT,
NIAGARA FALLS WILL BE BACK ON THE MAP, RIGHT, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLYMAN, JANITORETO.
>> WEAVE GOT IT.
WE HAVE A SHOT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD.
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE OUT THERE.
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE COMING AND SAYING I MIGHT WANT TO INVEST IN THAT CITY.
THEY'RE ON THE MOVE.
THEY'RE THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.
>> Stephen:  BOOM!
OUTSIDE-THE-BOX THINKING,
UNLESS, OF COURSE, WELL ENDA SLIPS, IN WHICH CASE THEY MIGHT NEED THAT BOX.
AND 0ETO IS RIGHT-- THIS WILL MAKE BUSINESSES WANT TO BUILD MANUFACTURING PLANT IN THE CITY
BECAUSE IF NIAGARA OFFICIALS ARE ENCOURAGING A MAN TO TIGHTED ROPE WALK ACROSS A WATER FALL IN
THE DARK, I THINK THAT SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THEIR WORKER SAFETY STANDARDS ARE NOT THE HIGHEST.
NOW, PERSONALLY, I HOPE THIS TYPE OF DEATH-DEIFYING STIMULUS PROGRAM CATCHES ON ALL ACROSS
THE RUST BEST.
MAYBE GARY, INDIANA, CAN FIRE A HUMAN CANNONBALL ACROSS LAKE MICHIGAN OR MAYBE SOMEONE COULD
ATTEMPT THE UNTHINKABLE-- WALK THROUGH DOWNTOWN DETROIT.
( APPLAUSE ) IF NOTHING ELSE, FOLKS, THIS INCREDIBLE STUNT OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE.
SOSO MANY RUST BELT AMERICANS BECAUSE IF NICK WELLENDA MAKES MAKES IT ACROSS THAT WIRE, HE WILL
WIND UP IN CANADA.
UNLESS, OF COURSE, HE GETS STOPPED BY CANADIAN CUSTOMS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, FOLKS
