( APPLAUSE )
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, PLEASE SIT DOWN.
THOUGH I AM LOATHE TO STOP
ANYONE WHO IS ABOUT TO TELL
ME A STORY OF HOW GREAT I AM
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, I HOPE YOU'RE
WATCHING THIS TV MOUNTED ON
THE JOG STROLLER BECAUSE YOU
SHOULD BE RUNNING FOR YOUR
LIVES.
(LAUGHTER)
AS WE SPEAK A DEFUNCT
SATELLITE IS HURTLING TOWARD
THE EARTH WHERE IT WILL
DESTROY EVERYTHING IN ITS
PATH.
LET'S JUST PRAY IT LANDS
SOMEWHERE IT CAN'T DO ANY
DAMAGE LIKE DETROIT.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS DEATH MACHINE, THIS
DEATH MACHINE IN QUESTION IS
NASA'S 20-YEAR-OLD UPPER
ATMOSPHERE RESEARCH
SATELLITE OR URSRS AS IN YOU
ARES ALL GOING TO DIE.
NOW FOLKS, FOLKS, WHILE
YOU'RE RUNNING FOR YOUR
LIVES, I DON'T WANT YOU TO
PANIC.
BECAUSE THE BOYS AT NASA
HAVE PINPOINTED THE PRECISE
TIME THE IMPACT WILL OCCUR.
JIM?
>> EXPERTS AT VANDENBERG AIR
FORCE BASE AND NASA SAY THE
SATELLITE WILL REENTER THE
ATMOSPHERE SOMETIME TOOFERM
NOON GIVE OR TAKE ABOUT 14
HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES, TOMORROW
AFTERNOON, GIVE OR TAKE 14
HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH MEANS YOU EITHER HAVE
UNTIL SATURDAY MORNING OR
YOU WERE VAPORIZED TWO HOURS
AGO.
AND NASA HAS PINPOINTED
EXACTLY WHERE THE SATELLITE
WILL FALL, JIM?
>> ENGINEERS NOW EXPECT IT
WILL BREAK INTO 100 PIECES
ON REENTRY, A QUARTER OF
THOSE COULD MAKE IT TO
EARTH.
NASA IS PRETTY SURE THAT ANY
SURVIVING PIECES OF THE
SATELLITE WILL FALL
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 57 DEGREES
NORTH AND 57 DEGREES SOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO THE EVACUATION ZONE--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE EVACUATION
ZONE IS THIS AREA.
(LAUGHTER)
RIGHT HERE.
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE 6
BILLION THRILL SEEK ARES IN
THE IMPACT ZONE, YOU WILL
WANT TO FLEE TO THE SAFETY
OF EITHER ANTARCTICA OR THE
NORWEGIAN ISLAND OF SVALBARG,.
AND FOLKS DON'T WORRY,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF
TIME TO GET THERE BECAUSE IN
ADDITION TO PROVIDING A 28
HOUR IMPACT WINDOW ACROSS
118 MILLION SQUARE MILE
DANGER ZONE, NASA IS
PROVIDING A 20 MINUTE
WARNING BEFORE THE SATELLITE
STRIKES.
(LAUGHTER)
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO
MAKE IT TO ANTARCTICA
PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE AN
EMERER PENGUIN.
NOW IF FOR SOME REASON YOU
ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO
EVACUATE THE HABITABLE ZONE
OF THE EARTH AND THE
SATELLITE CRASHES NEAR YOU,
NASA WARNS DO NOT TOUCH IT.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH OF COURSE MEANS,
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO
TOUCH IT.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN JUST THINK ABOUT IT,
FOLKS.
IT'S BEEN BOMBARDED WITH
SPACE RAYS FOR 20 YEARS.
OBVIOUSLY IT WILL GIVE YOU
SUPERPOWERS.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU COULD BECOME THE HUMAN
SATELLITE!
HALF MAN, HALF 5,000
CHANNELS OF CRYSTAL CHIEF
HIGH-DEF, THAT REQUEST
PARALYZE EVIL DOERS WITH TOO
MANY VIEWING OPTIONS.
LOOK UP IN THE SKY, IT'S A
BIRD, IT'S A PLANE, IT'S THE
HUMAN SATELLITE BURNING UP
ON REENTRY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS, YOU PROBABLY
WON'T HAVE THE CHANCE TO
TOUCH IT BECAUSE NASA HAS
REASSURED US THAT THE ODDS
OF IT HITTING ANY SPECIFIC
PERSON ARE ONE IN 21
TRILLION, WITH A MARGIN OF
ERROR OF PLUS OR
