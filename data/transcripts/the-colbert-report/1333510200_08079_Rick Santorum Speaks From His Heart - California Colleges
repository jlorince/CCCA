>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, TONIGHT IS PRIMARY NIGHT FOR WISCONSIN, MARYLAND, AND WASHINGTON, D.C
IT IS SO ADORABLE HOW D.C. TRIES TO VOTE JUST LIKE THE REAL STATES.
IT'S LIKE A DOG WITH PEANUT BUTTER IN ITS MOUTH.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S TALKING 500,000 AMERICANS ARE DISENFRANCHISED.
WOOF.
(LAUGHTER) AND WITH MITT ROMNEY PICKING UP MAJOR ENDORSEMENTS AND ALMOST
HALF THE DELEGATES TONIGHT COULD BE A MAKE-OR-BREAK FOR RICK SANTORUM.
NOT THAT RICK WOULD EVER CONSIDER QUITTING BECAUSE GOT DOES NOT APPROVE OF PULLING OUT.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I AM GLAD...
(APPLAUSE).
I FOR ONE AM GLAD THAT THIS GOOD MAN IS KEEPING IN THE THERE,
BECAUSE HE IS A CULTURE WARRIOR.
JUST LISTEN TO SANTORUM TELLING HOW BAD OUR COLLEGES HAVE BECOME  BECOME.
>> .
>> I WAS JUST READING SOMETHING LAST NIGHT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES,
THEY'RE... SEVERAL... I THINK IT'S SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM OF
UNIVERSITIES DON'T EVEN TEACH AN AMERICAN HISTORY COURSE.
NOT EVEN AVAILABLE TO BE TAUGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT IS AN OUTRAGE!
AMERICAN HISTORY SHOULD BE ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION.
THE OTHER CORNERSTONE BEING GETTING STONED IN A CORNER.
(LAUGHTER) THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD BE MORE OUTRAGEOUS IS IF THIS WERE TRUE.
(LAUGHTER) JIM?
>> THE STATEMENT WAS WRONG.
REARE THE ACTUAL FACTS.HE ALL OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY
SYSTEM AND ALL BUT ONE IN THE U.C. SYSTEM OFFER B.A. DEGREES IN HISTORY.
THIS IS THE CHAIR OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT AT CAL STATE EAST BAY
WHO, BY THE WAY, SAYS SHE'S A REPUBLICAN.
>> WE'RE ALL ONLINE.
HE CAN GO LOOK AT THE CATALOG AND SEE WHAT'S OFFERED AND SEE THE COURSE REQUIREMENTS.
I THINK HE JUST KIND OF PULLED IT OUT... I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE PULLED IT OUT OF.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TELL YOU WHERE HE PULLED IT OUT OF.
HIS HEART.
(LAUGHTER) AND I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE RICK GOT THIS ONE WRONG BECAUSE HE CITED A CLEAR SOURCE.
WHAT WAS THAT SOURCE AGAIN, JIM.
>> I WAS JUST READING SOMETHING LAST NIGHT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
LIKE ALL CRITICS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, RICK SUBSCRIBES TO THE SAME WEST COAST NEWSPAPER I DO.
IT'S THE "SOMETHING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEWS." (LAUGHTER)
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
AT U.C. DAVIS YOU GET AN "F" IF YOU'RE NOT GAYE.
HMM.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A SHOCKING INFOGRAPHIC.
OKAY, FINE.
SO MAYBE NINE OUT OF TEN SCHOOLS IN THE U.C. SYSTEM NOT ONLY TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY BUT
REQUIRE THEIR STUDENTS TO TAKE IT.
BUT ALL THAT MEANS IS RICK WAS A LITTLE OFF WITH HIS MATH.
BUT IF HIS CONTINUED CAMPAIGN HAS PROVEN ANYTHING, IT'S THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT MATH.
(LAUGHTER) BESIDES, THE BASIC MESSAGE WAS RIGHT.
THERE IS ONE SCHOOL IN THE U.C.
SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT OFFER A COURSE IN U.S. HISTORY.
U.C. SAN FRANCISCO.
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.
AND WHAT'S THEIR EXCUSE?
THEY'RE A MEDICAL SCHOOL.
(LAUGHTER) OH, REALLY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S JUST MORE HAIGHT-ASHBURY ELITISTS TRYING TO PUSH U.S.
HISTORY OUT OF OUR MEDICINE.
THAT MEANS THESE SO-CALLED DOCTORS AREN'T GOING TO HAVE A CLUE HOW TO WHITTLE GEORGE
WASHINGTON'S WOODEN TEETH OR PRESCRIBE THE TINCTURE OF MERCURY THAT CURED BEN
FRANKLIN'S SYPHILIS.
I CERTAINLY HOPE WHEN RICK SANTORUM MOVES ON TO THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY JUNE 5 HE
DOES NOT GET AN INTESTINAL BLOCKAGE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE DOCTORS OUT THERE ARE AS
QUALIFIED AS SANTORUM
