CLEARLY, AMICUS BRIEFS ARE THEGREATEST THING TO HAPPEN TO
JURISPRUDENCE SINCE THE CASE OFSLICED V. BREAD.
HERE TO TELL ME WHY THEY'RE NOTIS PROFESSOR
ALLISON ORR LARSEN.
THERE'S YOUR FANCY VIRGINA LAWREVIEW. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH
AMICUS BRIEFS BEING FILED WITHTHE COURT? IT LITERALLY MEANS
BEING FRIENDLY.
>> THE TROUBLE IS TODAY ANYBODYCAN BE A FACTUAL EXPERT OR CLAIM
TO BE.
>> STEPHEN: EXACTLY RIGHT,BECAUSE IF IT FEELS LIKE A FACT,
IT IS A FACT.
(LAUGHTER)>> BUT IF ALL THOSE ASSERTIONS
ARE MADE TO THE COURT IN DOZENSAND DOZENS OF BRIEFS, IT'S HARD
TO TELL WHICH ARE RELIABLE ANDWHICH ARE NOT.
>> STEPHEN: BUT ALL YOU HAVETO DO IS MERELY READ THE AMICUS
BRIEFS THAT AGREE WITH YOU ANDTHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE
YOUR OPINION.
>> I THINK THAT'S PART OF THEPROBLEM BECAUSE USUALLY, IN THE
LAW, WE HAVE TWO SIDES FIGHTINGIT OUT AND THE JUDGE PICKS WHICH
IS THE MOST RELIABLE OF THEEXPERTS BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE
WHEN THEY'RE COMING IN AT THEELEVENTH HOUR AND UNTESTED AND
THEY'RE SUPPORTING APRE-EXISTING POINT OF VIEW.
>> STEPHEN: COMING IN AT THEELEVENTH HOUR, IS THAT LIKE
BIDDING IN THE LAST FIVE SECONDSON EBAY?
>> A LITTLE LIKE THAT, EXCEPTBIGGER IMPLICATIONS.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
HAVE YOU EVER BID ON A TROLLDOLL?
IT GETS PRETTY VICIOUS.
(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)
WHAT ARE THESE AMICUS BRIEFSSUPPOSED TO BE?
IF THEY'RE NOT WHAT THEY'RESUPPOSED TO BE, WHAT WAS THE
GOLDEN STANDARD.
>> THEY WERE ORIGINALLY CALLEDFRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEFS A
LONG TIME AGO, WHEN A LAWYER INTHE COURT WOULD HELP THE COURT
OUT WITH A QUESTION OF LAW THATHE WANTED TO KNOW.
>> STEPHEN: THEY WOULD BEBATTLING AN ISSUE AND LOOK
AROUND AND SAY, IS THIS A LAWYERHERE?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
IS THERE A LAWYER IN THE HOUSE?
>> IT HASN'T BEEN THAT WAY IN ALONG TIME.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S HOW ITSTARTED OUT?
>> IT STARTED OUT THAT WAY.
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT WAY IN ALONG TIME.
NOW THEY'RE FILED BY MOTIVATEDGROUPS, PEOPLE WITH A DOG IN THE
FIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: WHY WOULDN'T YOUWANT A MOTIVATED PERSON IN
WHAT'S THE DOWN SIDE?
>> THE DOWN SIDE IS IF YOUAREN'T TESTING THAT, LIKE WHEN
YOU WANT AN EXPERT WITNESS ATTRIAL, YOU DON'T LET ANYBODY
COME TO THE COURTHOUSE STEPS TOTESTIFY.
>> STEPHEN: ANYBODY WHO AGREESWITH ME.
>> IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.
THERE'S SYSTEM IN PLACE FORDECIDING WHO CAN BE THE REAL
EXPERT AT THAT POINT IN TIME.
>> STEPHEN: SO WHO ARE THESEPOWERFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUBMITTING THESE?
ARE THESE LOBBYISTS?
>> NO, THERE IS ORGANIZATIONSCREATED TO LOBBY AND ALSO TO
FILE AMICUS BRIEFS, TOO, INSUPPORT OF THEIR ORGANIZATION.
>> STEPHEN: I'LL GIVE YOU ANEXAMPLE YOU'VE GOT HERE.
THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OFPEDIATRICS AND THE AMERICAN
ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS TAKEOPPOSITE POSITIONS ON ADOPTION
OF CHILDREN BY GAY COUPLES.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: WHICH ONE OF THEMIS RELIABLE?
>> WELL, IT'S HARD TO TELL,RIGHT?
>> STEPHEN: WHICH ONE ISAGAINST ADOPTION OF CHILDREN BY
GAY COUPLES?
>> THAT WOULD BE THE AMERICANCOLLEGE OF PEDIATRICS.
>> STEPHEN: SOUNDS LIKE GOODFOLKS.
(LAUGHTER)SO BOTH THESE ORGANIZATIONS
COULD SUBMIT AFRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEF AND
THE JUSTICES HAVE TO KEEP INMIND WHICH ONE HAS ALREADY MADE
UP THEIR DECISION IS ESSENTIALLYA LOBBYING ORGANIZATION?
>> YOU'RE LOOKING TO SUPPORTFACTS OF SOMETHING YOU ALREADY
BELIEVE ANYWAY.  IT'S ACONVENIENCE AND YOU PICK THE
BRIEF THAT FITS YOUR PREEXISTINGVIEW.
>> STEPHEN: WHICH JUSTICES DOTHIS MORE THAN OTHERS?
>> THEY ALL DO IT. THEY ALL CITEAMICUS BRIEFS.
SOME COMPLAIN WHEN THEIRCOLLEAGUES DO IT.
>> STEPHEN: DO THEY STILL DOIT THEMSELVES, THOUGH?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: WHO IS THAT?
DOES SCALIA DO IT?
DOES SCALIA COMPLAIN ABOUT IT?
>> HE DOES COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
>> STEPHEN: BUT DOES HE DO IT,ANYWAY?
>> HE HAS DONE IT.
>> STEPHEN: AH, THAT'S ANTONIN!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
