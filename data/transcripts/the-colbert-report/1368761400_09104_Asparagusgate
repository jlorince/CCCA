AND GENTLEMEN.
OH!
MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE HEROES ARE
ON FIRE.
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU KNOW, FOR
OBAMA WATCHDOGS LIKE ME, THE
LAST WEEK OF SCANDALS HAS BEEN
LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING.
( LAUGHTER )
AND SPEAKING OF CHRISTMAS, WHY
ARE ALL THE PRESENTS WRAPPED?
WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE?
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, OF COURSE, OBAMA HAS BEEN
IN FULL DAMAGE CONTROL TRYING TO
WIGGLE OUT OF THIS ONE, JUST
LIKE ME WIGGLED UP ON THE OF
SERVING IN VIETNAM.
( LAUGHTER )
SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T
ESCAPE THIS TIME BY CLAIMING TO
BE EIGHT YEARS OLD.
( LAUGHTER )
AND IT'S NOT JUST OBAMA, FOLKS.
YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT SENT
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
CONGRESSIONAL PINATA ERIC HOLDER
INTO THE SARLAAC PIT OF CAPITOL
HILL.
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER
WAS ON THE HOT SEAT WEDNESDAY.
PRESSED FOR ANSWERS BY THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
>> ERIC HOLDER IS BEING GRILLED
ON A COUPLE OF SCANDALS THAT ARE
ROCKING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
>> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC
HOLDER GRILLED BY LAWMAKERS.
>> GRILLED BY CONGRESS.
>> GETTING PEPPERED WITH
QUESTIONS.
>> Stephen:  MMM, GRILLED AND
PEPPERED.
THAT EXPLAINS WHY DARRELL ISSA
WAS WEARING THAT "KISS THE COOK"
APRON.
NOW, HOLDER DESPERATELY SPARRED
WITH THE GREAT MINDS ON THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, BUT THEN HE
BIT OFF MORE THAN HE COULD CHEW.
WHEN HE RAN UP AGAINST
CONGRESSMAN AND MAGICAL TALKING
CANTALOUPE LOUIE GOHMERT'S
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE F.B.I.'S
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BOSTON
BOMBERS.
>> YOU STATE AS A MATTER OF FACT
WHAT THE F.B.I. DID AND DID NOT
DO.
YOU SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW THAT.
AND YOU HAVE CHARACTERIZE THE
F.B.I. AS BEING NOT THOROUGH.
I KNOW WHAT THE F.B.I. DID.
YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT I KNOW.
THAT'S ALL.
>> I CANNOT HAVE A--
>> REGULAR ORDER.
>> CHALLENGE MY CHARACTER.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
REGULAR ORDER, PLEASE.
>> GENTLEMEN, WE'LL--
>> WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THAT.
>> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE
STATEMENTS THAT WHAT I SAID WAS
NOT TRUE WHEN ACTUALLY THE
REVERSE IS WHAT HAPPENED.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FAILED TO
ANSWER MY QUESTION ABOUT--
>> GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN.
>> ...CHAIRMAN.
>> ASPERSIONS ON MY ASPARAGUS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen:  DARE YOU CAFTA,
SPERGZS ON THAT MAN'S ASPARAGUS!
WHAT IS NEXT, SIR, LIABLING HIS
LETTUCE?
QUESTIONING HIS QUINOA.
ARGUING WITH HIS ARUGULA.
VILLIFYING HIS VINAIGRETTE
BEFORE DRIZZLING IT ON THE
SCANDAL SALAD?
CLEARLY, NATION, WE ARE GOING TO
NEED A LOT MORE HEARINGS ON
ASPARAGUS-GATE BECAUSE THE MORE
I DIGEST
