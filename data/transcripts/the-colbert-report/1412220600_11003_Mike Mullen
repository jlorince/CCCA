>> STEPHEN:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT 43 YEARSIN THE
NAVY.
THAT'S EVEN LONGER THAN THAT GUYFROM THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.
PLEASE WELCOME ADMIRALMIKE MULLEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )ADMIRAL, THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HONOR TO HAVE YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
NOW, YOU'RE RETIRED U.S. NAVYADMIRAL.
YOU SERVED AS THE 17THCHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF.
THAT'S A BIG JOB.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, I ASSUME YOU'REON BOARD WITH BILL O'REILLY'S
25,000-MAN MERCENARY ARMY.
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH,25,000 PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE
WORLD WHO GET TAUGHT ENGLISH ANDARE PAID VERY WELL, OR THE U.S.
ARMED FORCES?
WHICH WOULD YOU PICK?
AND, PLEASE, DON'T LET YOURYEARS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
JOINT CHIEFS INFLUENCE YOU INTHIS DECISION.
THINK OBJECTIVELY ABOUT THIS FORA SECOND.
MERCENARY ARMY-U.S. ARMEDFORCES.
YOU HAD TO PICK, WHICH WOULD ITBE?
>> IT WOULD BE THIS ONE.
>> STEPHEN:  OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BILL IS NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT.
THE MAN HAS A MERCENARY ARMY.
I WOULDN'T CROSS HIM.
>> I KNOW.
>> STEPHEN:  SO WE'RE IN SYRIANOW, AND WE'RE-- WE OFFICIALLY
DON'T HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUNDBUT WE HAVE ADVISERS ON THE
GROUND?
>> ACTUALLY, NOT IN SYRIA.
WE HAVE ADVISERS ON THE GROUNDIN IRAQ, ABOUT 1600 OF THEM.
>> STEPHEN:  HOW MUCH OF ADIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN
WESTERN IRAQ AND SYRIA AT THISPOINT?
THERE A BORDER?
>> I THINK IT'S JUST ACTUALLY INNAME ONLY.
I MEAN, THAT PART OF THE DESERTIS WIDE OPEN, AND AS FAR AS ISIL
RIGHT NOW, THEY CONTROL AN AWFULLOT OF TERRITORY, BOTH IN IRAQ
AND SYRIA.
THEY'VE CALLED IT THE BEGINNINGOF THE CALIPHATE, IF YOU WILL,
AND THEIR STATE THAT THEY'VEESTABLISHED, WHICH I DON'T THINK
HAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL UNDERPINNINGIN TERMS OF REALITY
INTERNATIONAL OR ANYTHING LIKE,THAT BUT IT'S WHAT THEY CLAIM.
>> STEPHEN:  THEY USED TO BETHE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ AND
SYRIA.
NOW THEY'RE JUST THE ISLAMICSTATE?
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN:  THEY'RE LIKECHER.
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT FANS OFCHER.
( LAUGHTER )HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO BE
DOING THIS?
>> WELL, MY-- MY VIEW OF THAT ISIN 2011 WHEN EGYPT STARTED TO
UNFOLD AND THE REVOLUTION THERE,I SAID THEN AND I STILL THINK IN
THAT PART OF THE WORLD, WE'RE INA 30- TO 40-YEAR RUN HERE.
>> STEPHEN:  30 TO 40 YEARS?
>> CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN:  SO LIKE THE COLDWAR.
>> IN TERMS OF THE REVOLUTIONAND THE CHANGE AND THE
UNCERTAINTY AND THE INSTABILITY.
AND I THINK IT'S JUST CASCADEDFROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
>> STEPHEN:  DO YOU THINKAMERICA'S REPUTATION IN THE
WORLD BECAUSE OF THE MILITARYENGAGEMENT WE'VE HAD OVER THE
LAST 13 YEARS IS DAMAGED?
>> I DO.
I DO.
I THINK IN FACT-- I DON'T KNOWHOW MANY PEOPLE I COULD ASK THAT
WOULD GET THE CORRECT ANSWER TOTHIS QUESTION WHICH IS HAVING
BOMBED SYRIA, HOW MANY MUSLIMCOUNTRIES HAVE WE BOMBED?
THIS IS OUR SEVENTH.
>> STEPHEN:  YEAH, YEAH, ONEMORE AND WE GET A FREE FALAFAL.
HERE'S ONE THING.
LET'S TALK ABOUT MILITARY--LET'S TALK.
A REAL SUCCESSFUL MILITARYMISSION THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD
FEEL GREAT ABOUT, AND THAT'SWHEN WE WENT AND GOT BIN LADEN.
YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WHEN THATTHING WAS GOING DOWN.
AND YOU HAD TO BE THE ONE TOCALL THE HEAD OF THE PAKISTANI
MILITARY.
>> CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN:  TO SAY THAT WEGOT HIM.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN:  HOW WAS THAT?
( LAUGHTER )DID YOU SAY, "HI, IT'S MIKE.
WE FOUND BIN LADEN.
GUESS WHERE?"( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
WAS HE CHAGRINED?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN:  WERE THEYCHAGRINED AT ALL?
>> HE WAS-- HE WAS ACTUALLYSURPRISED.
I MEAN, LITERALLY.
NOW, THIS IS IN THE HUMANDIMENSION.
I KNOW THIS DOESN'T MAKE A LOTOF SENSE, BUT I KNEW HIM PRETTY
WELL, AND HIS REACTION WASSURPRISE, ONE, THAT WE'D FOUND
HIM, AND, TWO, THAT HE WAS WHEREWE FOUND HIM, WHICH WAS ABOUT A
MILE FROM THEIR-- THEIR VERSIONOF WEST POINT.
AND HE HAD THE WORST WEEK OF HISLIFE --
>> STEPHEN:  NOT AS BAD AS BINLADEN'S.
>> NO, I KNOW.
>> STEPHEN:  DO YOU EVER GETTIRED OF THE MIDDLE EAST?
DO YOU EVER WANT TO JUST THROWUP YOUR HANDS AND GO BACK TO BED
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN:  NO?
>> WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ISSORT OF AN OVER-ARCHING STRATEGY
AND PLAN FOR THE MIDDLE EASTCOUNTRY BY COUNTRY, AND THEN
EVEN IN THE REGIONAL SENSE PERSE.
AND I THINK HAVING THAT ANDHAVING A VIEW OF THAT WOULD THEN
ALLOW EVERYBODY TO FIGURE OUTHOW THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE IF
IT'S ANOTHER COUNTRY, OR WECOULD CONTRIBUTE, EVEN INSIDE
OUR OWN COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN:  CAN I TELL YOUWHY I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
MIGHT BE TIRED OF IT?
AND WANT TO GO BACK TO BED?
AND I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,AND, THEREFORE, THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
IS BECAUSE--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE'RE-- WE'RE ASKED TO BE AFRAIDOF IT.
YOU GET TO THINK ABOUT IT ALLTHE TIME OR YOU DID GET TO THINK
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME AND SAY TOYOURSELF, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT LITTLE CORNER OF THE DESERTLOOKS LIKE IT COULD BLOW UP REAL
GOOD, LET'S GO OVER THERE.
WHEREAS, WE'RE ASKED TO BEAFRAID OF IT, AND WE'RE REMINDED
TO BE AFRAID OF IT, BUT WE NOLONGER HAVE MUCH OF A VOICE IN
IT BECAUSE OUR CONGRESSIONALREPRESENTATIVES WON'T VOTE OR
WHETHER WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DOANYTHING ABOUT IT.
WE'RE NOT ASKED TO SACRIFICETHAT MUCH FOR IT.
VERY FEW OF US GO FIGHT.
AND WE'RE ALSO NOT TOLD ALL THATMUCH ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER
THERE.
SO ALL WE HAVE IS THE FEAR, ANDNONE OF THE ACTION.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN:  AND SO WEEVENTUALLY WANT TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT IT.
AND THAT'S WHY THAT 25,000-MANMERCENARY ARMY STARTS TO SOUND
GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )SO WE ALSO--
( APPLAUSE )WE ALSO WANT TO STOP CARING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR MENAND WOMEN WHO GO OVER THERE
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TOSACRIFICE FOR SOMETHING THAT WE
DON'T THINK IS RIGHT.
AND YET WE DON'T HAVE MUCH VOICEIN IT ANYMORE.
( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
>> SO YOU BRING UP A CONCERNTHAT I HAVE WITH RESPECT TO A
GROWING DISCONNECT BETWEEN THEMEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN THIS
ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE, WHO ARE THEBEST I'VE EVER SEEN.
THEY'RE LESS THAN 1% OF THEPOPULATION.
THEY COME FROM FEWER AND FEWERPLACES IN AMERICA.
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHODIDN'T HAVE TO BUY INTO THESE
WARS, AS YOU SAID-- AND I AGREEWITH THAT-- AND CERTAINLY THE
VAST, VAST MAJORITY DIDN'T HAVETO FIGHT IN THEM, DON'T KNOW WHO
WE ARE AS A MILITARY.
AND IN FACT-- AND I'VE SAID THISMANY TIMES, WHAT I ACTUALLY DO
WORRY ABOUT IS THAT WE BECOMESOME VERSION OF SOMETHING LIKE
THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION, WHICHIS PLEASE GO OFF AND FIGHT OUR
DIRTY LITTLE WARS AND LET US GETON WITH OUR LIVES.
AND I THINK THAT'S A DISASTERFOR AMERICA.
WE NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THEAMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO
DO THAT THROUGH THE SYSTEMTHAT'S HERE, THOSE THAT ARE
ELECTED, AND I CERTAINLY AGREETHAT THOSE WHO ARE ELECTED OUGHT
TO VOTE ON WHAT WE DO.
AND WE OUGHT TO--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND IF I CAN MAKE-- AND WE OUGHTTO HAVE A FULSOME, RAGING DEBATE
ABOUT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> STEPHEN:  ADMIRAL, THANKYOU SO MUCH.
ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
