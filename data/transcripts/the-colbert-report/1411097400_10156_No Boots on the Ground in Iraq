(LAUGHTER)NATION, WITH TERROR GROUPS, 71,
RUNNING ROUGHSHOD ALL OVER THEMIDDLE EAST, AMERICA FACES AN
EXISTENTIAL THREAT UNLIKE ANYTHIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN, AND
ITS NAME IS BARACK OBAMA.
'CUZ WHEN IT COMES TO IGNITING ACLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS BASED ON
CENTURIES OLD ANIMOSITY, THISGUY'S HEART JUST ISN'T IN IT.
LISTEN TO HIS NON-COMMITTALCOMMITMENT OF AMERICAN FORCES.
>> AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, THESEAMERICAN FORCES WILL NOT HAVE A
COMBAT MISSION.
WE WILL NOT GET DRAGGED INTOANOTHER GROUND WAR IN IRAQ.
>> STEPHEN: WELL, NOT WITHTHAT ATTITUDE WE WON'T!
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING THIS
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THEY WON'TDO.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TOINSIST THERE WILL BE NO BOOTS ON
THE GROUND.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS DETERMINEDTHAT THOSE BOOTS WILL NOT BE
AMERICAN BOOTS THAT ARE ON THEGROUND.
>> THE NOTION THAT THE UNITEDSTATES SHOULD BE PUTTING BOOTS
ON THE GROUND, I THINK, WOULD BEA PROFOUND MISTAKE.
>> STEPHEN: OF COURSE THEREWON'T BE AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE
GROUND.
OUR SHOES ARE ALL MADE IN CHINA.
(LAUGHTER)OKAY.
SO STOP WORRYING!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU CLAIM "NO" BOOTS ON THE
GROUND.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 1,600 TROOPSWE ALREADY HAVE THERE?
DO THEY NOT HAVE BOOTS?
ARE THEY BAREFOOT, SIR?
THEY COULD STUB A TOE!
AND THE V.A. IS ALREADYOVERWHELMED!
I'M JUST CONFUSED BY THIS MIXEDMESSAGE.
WHAT THE HELL DOES ANY OF THISMEAN?
>> HERE'S WHY THE PRESIDENT ISSO SURE THERE WILL BE NO BOOTS
ON THE GROUND.
BECAUSE HE JUST CHANGED THE NAMETO "FORWARD DEPLOYMENT."
>> WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
WHY CAN'T YOU CALL BOOTS ON THEGROUND BOOTS ON THE GROUND?
>> WHO ARE THESE BOOTS ON THEGROUND?
>> WHO ARE THE BOOTS?
WHOSE BOOTS ARE THEY?
WHERE ARE THESE BOOTS COMINGFROM?
SOMEBODY'S IMAGINATION OR ARETHEY REAL?
>> I WOULD ASSUME THEY'RE BOOTSON THE GROUND UNLESS THEY'RE IN
THAT MICHAEL J. FOX, UH,HOVERCRAFT.
THAT SKATEBOARD.
>> STEPHEN: WELL, OBAMA?
ARE THE BOOTS NOT ON THE GROUNDBECAUSE THEY'RE ON THAT MICHAEL
J. FOX HOVERBOARD?
OR ARE THEY NOT ON THE GROUND
BECAUSE OUR TROOPS HAVE TURNEDINTO TEEN WOLVES AND ARE DUNKING
A BASKETBALL RIGHT NOW?
WHICH MICHAEL J. FOX MOVIE ISIT?
AND PLEASE DON'T SAY "CASUALTIESOF WAR."
FORTUNATELY, FOX NEWS GUEST ANDH.P. LOVECRAFT TRIBUTE NAME
PETER HEGSETH WAS ABLE TORESOLVE ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE FOOTWEAR, AS WELL AS THEFOOT-WHEN, AND THE FOOT-WHY.
JIM?
>> SO THIS RIGHT HERE, GRETCHEN,IS A CONVENTIONAL STANDARD ARMY
ISSUE COMBAT BOOT.
THIS IS WHAT A TRIGGER PULLERWOULD WEAR.
THIS IS WHAT I WORE IN IRAQ.
THIS IS THE MASSIVE ARMEDFORCES.
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT BRINGINGTHEM OR HAVING THEM ON THE
GROUND AT THIS POINT.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ABOOT LIKE THIS.
THIS IS A BOOT OF A SPECIALOPERATOR OR ONE THAT THEY MIGHT
WEAR.
THESE -- THIS IS WHAT WE'RETALKING ABOUT.
>> I GUESS THE POINT THAT YOU'REMAKING IS THE BOOTS THAT YOU
BROUGHT TO THE SHOW TODAY MAYLOOK DIFFERENT, BUT A BOOT IS A
BOOT.
>> THEY'RE BOTH BOOTS.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: YES!
THEY'RE BOTH BOOTS!
FOLKS, THIS RIGHT HERE, THAT --THAT IS THE TYPE OF IN-DEPTH
REPORTING YOU CAN ONLY GET FROMFOX NEWS OR ZAPPOS!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
THE POINT IS, DIFFERENT TROOPSWEAR DIFFERENT BOOTS.
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION --WHICH FOOTWEAR ARE WE WILLING TO
PUT ON THE GROUND?
I MEAN, OBAMA SAID HE WOULDN'TPUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
BUT APPARENTLY, THAT WAS A TOTALCROC, BECAUSE NOW HE'S
FLIP-FLOPPING, WHICH IS MAKINGTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY "UGG"!
AND (BLEEP) ME.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
I'VE ALWAYS SAID OBAMA IS ALOAFER.
BUT WITH HIS CONSTANT GOLFING,NOW HE JUST LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF CLOWN!
(LAUGHTER)'CUZ HE KNOWS BOOTS ON THE
GROUND ARE A SLIPPER-Y SLOPE,AND THE LAST THING HE NEEDS IS
ANOTHER WEDGE ISSUE.
HE NEEDS TO STOP CONVERSE-INGWITH OUR ALLIES AND JUST DO IT!
COWBOY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)OTHERWISE, THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS
GOING TO BE TAKING IT IN THEBOOTY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
