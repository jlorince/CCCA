EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SAYS THAT
ROMNEY IS THE HOPE OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE HE'S ALSO
THE HOPE OF THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID FRUM.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY MR. FRUM.
DAVID, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT.
YOU ARE NO STRANGER TO THIS
SHOW.
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BRING IT
HOT AND HARD, AND YOU KNOW I GOT
SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE THINGS
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW.
>> I'M READY FOR IT.
>> Stephen: BACK IN NOVEMBER
YOU WROTE A LITTLE ARTICLE FOR
"NEW YORK" MAGAZINE THAT SAID,
"WHEN DID THE G.O.P. LOSE TOUCH
WITH REALITY."
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
FIRST OF ALL, WHY IS IT A BAD
THING TO LOSE TOUCH WITH
REALITY?
HAVE YOU SEEN REALITY LATELY?
IT'S TERRIBLE.
>> IT'S PRETTY BAD.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
SUFFERING PRETTY BADLY.
AND WHAT HAPPENS IN A DEMOCRACY
IS PARTIES SHOULD BE COMPETING
TO OFFER SOLUTIONS TO THE
PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE.
>> Stephen: THEY ARE.
THEY ARE.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE COMPETING TO
SEE WHO CAN DO THE BIGGEST TAX
CUT.
>> WORKABLE SOLUTIONS THAT
DELIVER REAL BENEFITS FOR AS
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: THAT WAS BACK IN
NOVEMBER THAT IN THIS "NEW YORK"
MAGAZINE YOU SAID, "HAS THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY LOST TOUCH WITH
REALITY."
NOW YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE
GOTTEN BACK IN TOUCH WITH
REALITY.
WHY?
BASED ON WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU
SEE THAT?
>> WELL, I'M NOT MAKING SUCH A
BIG CLAIM.
THE CLAIM I'M MAKING IS, LOOK,
WE NEED A REPUBLICAN PARTY
THAT'S ECONOMICALLY INCLUSIVE,
ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE,
SOCIALLY MODERN AND THAT CAN
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR THE
VOTES OF EVERYBODY.
>> Stephen: I DISAGREE WITH
EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID.
IF YOU THINK ROMNEY IS THAT GUY.
>> THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW
MITT ROMNEY WAS IN PERSON WAS IN
THE SUMMER OF 2006.
HE WAS TALKING THE A SMALL GROUP
ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE PLAN HE
BROUGHT TO MASSACHUSETTS.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE
BECOME A HUGE BELIEVER IN IS THE
IMPORTANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE
SKILL, EXECUTIVE ABILITY.
HE KNEW HIS BRIEF.
HE KNEW HIS MATERIALMENT HE
TALKED ABOUT HOW HE USED PRIVATE
SECTOR COMPETITION TO BRING
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE
TO A STATE WHERE 6% TO 10% OF
THE POPULATION WAS UNINSURED.
THAT WAS REAL ACHIEVEMENT.
I THOUGHT THAT GUY COULD REALLY
RUN AN ORGANIZATION.
>> BUT THIS THING IS THE SAME
THING HE'S RUNNING AWAY FROM SO
FAST AS IF THERE'S A RABID TIGER
ON HIS TAIL.
DO YOU THINK THE THINGS HE'S
SAYING NOW ARE NOT WHAT HE MEANS
OR ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU HEARD
HIM TALK ABOUT IN 2006 NOT WHAT
HE MEANS BECAUSE "YOU CAN QUOTE YOU LIKE
ROMNEY.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE YOU LIKE?
>> I THINK HE'S THE PERSON WHO
IS HIS FATHER'S SON.
HIS FATHER IS ONE OF THE
GREAT...
>>
>> Stephen: I CERTAINLY HOPE
SO.
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE SCANDAL
IF HE IS NOT.
AND I THINK THAT'S OFFENSIVE TO
EVEN BRING UP THAT ISSUE.
BUT GO AHEAD.
>> ONE OF THE GREAT INCLUSIVE
REPUBLICANS OF THE 20th
CENTURY AND MAN WHO...
>> WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO SAYS
OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST AND WILLING
TO RAISE HIS HANDS OVER NOT SURE
ABOUT EVOLUTION?
I LIKE THAT GUY.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GUY
YOU THINK HE IS.
>> I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THAT.
AND THAT'S THE ONLY PART I LIKE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T ASK
THESE GUYS TO BE MARTYRS THAT.
IS A... WE HAVE A CRISIS IN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY OF
FOLLOWERSHIP, OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
WILLING OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
TO COMPETE AND RUN IN THIS
MODERN COUNTRY.
THE REPUBLICANS I THINK DID NOT
UNDERSTAND ENOUGH WHAT HAPPENED
IN 2006 AND 2008, AND THEY
OVERINTERPRET WHAT HAPPENED IN
2010.
>> Stephen: TALK ABOUT 2010,
TEA PARTY.
DO YOU THINK, AND LISTEN, I WANT
THE REPUBLICANS TO WIN.
I JUST THINK WE NEED A STAUNCH
CONSERVATIVE TO DO IT BECAUSE
THE TEA PARTY GAVE ALL THAT FUEL
TO THE REPUBLICANS TWO YEARS
AGO.
HOW CAN ROMNEY APPEAL TO THE TEA
PARTY?
AS A MORMON, I'M NOT SURE HE'S
ALLOWED TO DRINK TEA OR PARTY.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHEERING]
>> IF WE COULD ARRANGE IT SO
THAT IN 2012 ONLY 40% OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAME OUT TO VOTE
AND A QUARTER OF THEM WERE OVER
THE AGE OF 65...
>> Stephen: THE REPUBLICANS
ARE WORKING ON IT.
>> THEN THE TEA PARTY IDEA MIGHT
WORK.
THIS IS A COUNTRY FULL OF YOUNG
PEOPLE.
THIS IS A COUNTRY FULL OF PEOPLE
WORRIED MORE ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT
THAN PROTECTING THEIR PERSONAL
MEDICARE.
ONE THING I WORRY ABOUT A LOT IS
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REPUBLICAN
POLICY THAT IS MORE THAN A
GOING-OUT-OF-BUSINESS SALE FOR
THE BABY BOOM GENERATION.
>> Stephen: IF ROMNEY WINS ON
SATURDAY, SHOULD NEWTON AND RON
PAUL AN PERRY AND SANTORUM GET
OUT OF THE RACE?
>> THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO VERY
SOON BECAUSE THE MONEY WILL DRY
UP.
>> Stephen: FOR THE GOOD OF
THE PARTY?
>> I THINK IN SOME WAYS DEBATES
ARE GOOD.
>> Stephen: YES OR NO, SHOULD
THEY GET OUT?
>> I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE THIS OVER AS RAPIDLY AS
POSSIBLE AND ALLOW ROMNEY TO
START COMPETING FOR THE VOTES OF
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AS A WHOLE
AND NOT JUST TO THE SMALL PART
OF IT THAT TAKES PART IN
REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES.
>> WHAT ABOUT THIRD-PARTY
CANDIDATES?
IN THE SAME POLL, IN A THREE-WAY
RACE, I WOULD GET 13% RUNNING AS
AN INDEPENDENT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT YOUR SPEECH AT THE TAMPA
CONVENTION.
>> I HAVE, TOO.
>> AND I THINK...
>> Stephen: I THINK THEY OWE
ME AT THIS POINT AT LEAST LIKE A
3:00 A.M. SPOT.
>> YOU'VE LOCKED DOWN THE
REPUBLICAN BASE.
I THINK WE NEED TO BROADEN YOUR
APPEAL TO MODERATES AND
INDEPENDENTS.
>> Stephen: SHOULD I JUST
PRETEND I BELIEVE THINGS I DON'T
SO I CAN WIN LIKE ROMNEY?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> DON'T YOU DO THAT EVERY
NIGHT?
DON'T YOU DO THAT EVERY NIGHT?
>> Stephen: I BELIEVE EVERY
WORD I SCREAM DOWN THAT PIPE.
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
FROM THE DAIL BEAT AND
"NEWSWEEK."
DAVID FRUM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.
