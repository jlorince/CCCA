(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
TAKE A LOAD OFF.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I HAD A BEAUTIFUL WEEKEND.
I WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON D.C. FOR THE CONSERVATIVE VALUES VOTERS SUMMIT.
NOT EXACTLY A GALA AFFAIR.
FOR SOME REASON THE GROUP FIGHTING TO DEFY GAY PEOPLE RIGHTS HAS TROUBLE FINDING A COMPETENT PARTY PLANNER.
BUT I TELL YOU THIS, IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO HEAR FROM PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE VOICES LIKE JAN BREWER,
CIRCUMSTANCE CAMERON, ERIC CANTOR AND A 9 MILLIMETER FIRING AT A DISK OF BIRTH-CONTROL PILLS.
BUT FOLKS--  (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, ONLY ONE SPEAKER DOWN THERE REALLY APPEALED TO THE VOTERS' HEART AND... WELL, JUST HEART.
>> WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE MEDIA ON OUR SIDE, EVER IN THIS TIME.
WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE ELITE SMART PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES.
HE'S RIGHT.
AND IT IS TIME...  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT IS HIGH TIME THAT GOPS STOP TRYING TO APPEAL TO SMART PEOPLE.
AND LETTING RICK SANTORUM IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE IS A GREAT PLACE TO START.
FOLKS, THE REST OF THE PARTY NEEDS TO FALL IN LINE.
DO YOU HEAR THAT MICHELE BACHMANN, TONE IT DOWN!
NATION, IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY SAID WHAT WE WERE ALL NOT THINKING.
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW THINGS DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM.
SORRY, ELITE, BUT WE'VE GIVEN YOUR PRO KNOWLEDGE WISDOM-PUSHING POLICIES A CHANCE AND THEY HAVE FAILED.
F-A-L-7 D-FAILED.
AND THIS IS A WAKE-UP CALL TO ALL ANTI-INTELLECTUAL AMERICANS.
I'M NOT TALKING JUST ABOUT THE DUMB PEOPLE.
I'M TALKING TO THE DROOLERS.
THE MOUTH BREATHERS, THOSE STRUGGLING TO FINISH THE KID'S MAZE ON A LONG JOHN'S SILVERS PLACEMENT.
STAND UP, SHAKE THAT BUCKET OFF YOUR HEAD AND BE COUNTED.
UNFORTUNATELY TO DO THAT
