(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, FOLKS, REGULAR VIEWERS OF THIS BROADCAST KNOW THAT I AM THE ACCLAIMED AUTHOR OF THE
32-PAGE NOVEL "I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU." I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN A HUGE
SUCCESS TOPPING THE BEST-SELLER LISTS OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND AMAZON!
AND FULFILLING MY LIFE LONG DREAM OF RIPPING "GOOD NIGHT MOON" A NEW ONE.
(LAUGHTER) IN YOUR FACE, QUIET OLD LADY WHISPERING HUSH.
(LAUGHTER) BUT, OF COURSE, THE QUESTION REMAINS IS MY BOOK A CLASSIC.
DOES IT OCCUPY THE SAME RAREFIED AIR AS THE "BROTHERS CARE MAT SOLVE."
"THE GREAT GATSBY" OR THE FLAMING NOVEL OF LUST AND
SLAVERY "DRAGONARD" BY RUPERT GILCHRIST, AUTHOR OF THE "DRAGONARD" SAGA.
OF COURSE, ANY CRAFTSMAN MUST STAND THE TEST OF TIME.
MY BOOK HAS BEEN ON SALE FOR TEN WEEKS, TIME'S UP.
AND THE LITERARY COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED WITH A RESOUNDING SURE BECAUSE MY BOOK IS BEING
DISPLAYED AT PHILADELPHIA'S LITTLE KNOWN ROSENBACH MUSEUM AND LIBRARY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET.
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS WHO'S HONORING ME NOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ON TONIGHT'S EPISODE OF WHO'S HONORING ME NOW WE TRAVEL TO THE
ROSENBACH MUSEUM IN PHILADELPHIA.
>> THE ROSENBACH QUITE SIMPLY IS ONE OF THE GREATEST COLLECTIONS
OF RARE BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: THE CURATOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESERVING SOME OF HISTORY'S MOST INVALUABLE DOCUMENTS.
>> THESE INCLUDE GEORGE WASHINGTON'S EARLIEST SURVIVING LETTERS.
>> Stephen: INTERESTING.
>> WE HAVE SPEECHES WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN WRITTEN OUT BY HAND.
>> NICE.
WHAT ELSE.
>> EVEN NAPOLEON'S PENIS WAS AT ONE POINT PART OF THE COLLECTION.
>> Stephen: OKAY, NOT TECHNICALLY A DOCUMENT BUT I AM IMPRESSED.
>> MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THE CENTERPIECE OF THE ROSENBACH
COLLECTION IS THE MANUSCRIPT TO JAMES JOYCE'S "ULYSSES."
>> Stephen: YES, "ULYSSES" THE BOOK HERALDED AS THE GREATEST
NOVEL OF ALL TIME BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLAIMED TO HAVE READ IT.
>> "ULYSSES" IS NOT JUST A BOOK,
IT'S A WORTH OF ART, ITS AUTHOR MANIPULATED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
IN A WAY NO ONE EVER HAD AND NO ONE HAS SINCE TO TELL ONE OF THE GREATEST STORIES IN ABSOLUTELY
DAZZLING FASHION.
>> Stephen: BUT DOES IT HAVE PICTURES?
>> NO, IT DOES NOT.
>> Stephen: WELL, MINE DOES.
MEET THE NEW ULYSSES.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOOK GUY?
>> THE ROSENBACH MUSEUM AND LIBRARY IS INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING THE MANUSCRIPT TO "I
AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU" SO IT CAN RESIDE DIRECTLY NEXT TO
JAMES JOYCE'S "ULYSSES." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, MY MANUSCRIPT FOR "I AM A POLE"
BESIDE JAMES JOYCE'S ONLY COMPLETE HANDWRITTEN MANUSCRIPT FOR "ULYSSES."
I ONLY WISH FWHA POLEIAN'S PENIS WERE ALIVE TO SEE IT.
WANT ANYTHING ELSE?
>> IT'S ALWAYS FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT AUTHORS HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL OR NEED AT THEIR
WRITING TABLE TO CREATE SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
WELL, IN THAT CASE I'LL GIVE YOU THE NAEN I WROTE TO THING WITH.
AND THE BACKUP PEN I HAD IN MY POCKET IN CASE THAT ONE DIDN'T WORK.
>> WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT A BACKUP PEN.
>> WELL, WHAT IF I THREW IN PENCIL SKETCHES I PAID SOME GUY TO DRAW?
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
YOU'LL GET THE RHYMING DICTIONARY I USED BECAUSE I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT
RIMED WITH "POHL." PLUS, FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY
YOU'LL RECEIVE WHAT'S LEFT OVER FROM THE TURKEY SANDWICH I ATE
WHILE WRITING THE BOOK AND IF YOU ACT NOW YOU'LL ALSO GET THE BEER I DRANK.
PLUS PLUS THE CAP.
>> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING A LITTLE FAR TO SAY A BUD LIGHT
BOTTLE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CREATION OF A MANUSCRIPT.
>> TRUST ME, DEREK, IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL.
SO CONGRATULATIONS, AMERICA.
BECAUSE NOW MY MANUSCRIPT AND ALL THIS OTHER CRAP IS OFFICIALLY ENSHRINED IN ITS
RIGHTFUL PLACE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE FORMER GREATEST BOOK OF ALL TIME.
AND WHO WOULDN'T BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT?
>> I THINK JOYCE WOULD PROBABLY BE EXASPERATED BY SEEING ANY
BOOKS NEXT TO "ULYSSES" WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS THE GREATEST BOOK OF ALL TIME.
BUT PARTICULARLY A BOOK THAT IS ILLUSTRATED AND SHORT WOULD JUST MAKE HIM VERY, VERY MAD.
>> Stephen: (BLEEP) JOYCE.
>> PRETTY MUCH RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, DON'T FORGET TO STOP BY AND SEE
>> "I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU" AT THE ROSENBACH MUSEUM FROM NOW UNTIL LATER
