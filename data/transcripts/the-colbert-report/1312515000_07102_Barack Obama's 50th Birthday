[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING
"STEPHEN"]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THAT SOUND OF YOUR CHANTING IS
SO SOOTHING IT'S LIKE PUTTING A
SEASHELL UP TO YOUR EAR INTO
WHICH YOU HAVE STUFFED YOUR OWN
EGO.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, IT'S BARACK OBAMA'S
50th BIRTHDAY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN,
FOLKS, WHEN THE PRESIDENT TRIES
TO CONVINCE US HE WAS BORN.
[LAUGHTER]
WE'RE NOT BUYING IT, OBAMA.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS ARE BORN IN FEBRUARY.
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED
PRESIDENT'S DAY.
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS
ANGRY.
SO IS SEAN HANNITY'S VOICE.
>> ECONOMIC ARMAGEDDON HAS BEEN
AVOIDED, BUT THE ECONOMY REMAINS
IN TATTERS, SO HOW DOES THE
PRESIDENT REACT?
HE THROWS HIMSELF A LAVISH
BIRTHDAY BASH.
>> Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT.
INSTEAD OF GOING TO A BIRTHDAY
PARTY, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON THE ECONOMY.
NOW THE RECESSION IS GOING TO
LAST FOUR HOURS LONGER.
[LAUGHTER]
IT IS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TURN A YEAR
OLDER WHEN THE NATION IS IN
CRISIS.
AND IT'S NOT FIRST TIME OBAMA
HAS PULLED THIS STUNTD.
I HAVE LEARNED THAT BARACK OBAMA
HAS SELFISHLY CELEBRATED A
BIRTHDAY DURING EVERY CRISIS FOR
THE LAST 50 YEARS.
[LAUGHTER]
IN AUGUST OF 1964, TWO DAYS
AFTER THE GULF OF TONKIN
INCIDENT, HE HAD THE NERVE TO
TUSH THREE YEARS OLD.
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SENT A SLICE
OF CAKE TO HO CHI MINH.
FOLKS, IN BAD TIMES YOU PUT YOUR
COUNTRY FIRST AND POSTPONE YOUR
BIRTHDAY.
I DO.
THAT'S WHY I'M STILL 28.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
[LAUGHTER]
HELP ME.
I HAVE TO MOISTURIZE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOLKS, SEAN HANNITY IS NO
HYPOCRITE HERE.
>> I AM GOING TO BE 50 YEARS OLD
THIS DECEMBER.
>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
>> YOU COULD SAY THAT TO THE
PRESIDENT.
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
JUAN, I HAVE TOLD EVERYONE OF MY
FRIENDS AND MY WIFE, I WANT
NOTHING ON MY BIRTHDAY.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY WANTS A SURPRISE PARTY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, SEAN, SEAN, I HAPPEN TO
KNOW ONE SEXY FOX BLONDS ANCHOR
WHO
