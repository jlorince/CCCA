>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU, FOLKS.
FOLKS, REVIEWERS ALL KNOW
THAT I NEVER RUSH TO
JUDGEMENT.
I LIKE TO SAVOR MY
CONDEMNATIONS.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG
OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I AM A LIFELONG FAN
OF THE BEATLESING ESPECIALLY
THEIR EARLY STUFF.
THEY KIND OF LOST ME AFTER
THEY GOT ALL FREAKY WITH
THAT I WANT TO HOLD YOUR
HAND.
OF COURSE EVERYBODY HAD
THEIR FAVORITE THERE WAS
PAUL THE CUTE ONE, GEORGE
THE QUIET ONE, RINGO THE
RINGO ONE, AND JOHN, THE
CONSERVATIVE ONE.
JIM.
>> JOHN LENNON, THE VOICE OF
CONSERVATIVES?
IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED A
LONG TIME FRIEND SAYS
LENNON'S POLITICS WERE
RIGHT-LEANING LATER IN LIFE.
SAYING LENNON WAS A RONALD
REAGAN FAN AND LOVED ARGUING
WITH HIS FRIENDS.
HIS POLITICS FELL LEFT OF
CENTRE.
>> AHA!.
WE GOT A BEATLE.
>> THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A
TIP OF MY LAT TO CLOSET
REPUBLICAN JOHN LENNON.
>>
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> FOLKS, THIS CLAIM IS ROCK
SOLID.
AFTER ALL IT COMES FROM A
GUY WHO WORKS FOR LENNON FOR
OVER A YEAR BASED ON A
SINGLE CONVERSATION WITH
LENNON 31 YEARS AGO WHERE
LENNON SAID HE MIGHT VOTE
FOR REAGAN INSTEAD OF
CARTER.
FOLKS, I CANNOT WAIT TO RUB
THIS IN THE FACE OF ALL
THOSE PEAKNIK HIPPIES WHO
HAVE BEEN SINGING LENNON
SONGS IN THEIR ANARCHIST PAN
SEXUAL POT SMOKING DRUM
CIRCLE.
BECAUSE CONSERVATIVE VALUES
RUN THROUGHOUT LENNON'S
SONG.
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH
DIAMONDS WAS JUST A CODED
MESSAGE SECRETLY ENDORSING
SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS
BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER
LUCY'S SKY DIAMONDS WOULD
TRICKLE DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN JOHN
SANG I AM THE EGGMAN I AM
THE WALRUS GOO GOO G'JOOB,
HE MEANT TORT REFORM?
(APPLAUSE)
SO LENNON WAS A CONSERVATIVE
UNLESS HE COMES ON TO MY
SHOW AND DEBATES ME
OTHERWISE.
IF HE DOESN'T, HE IS A
COWARD.
NEXT, A WAG OF MY FINGER TO
BBADU.COM WHICH IS TO THE A
SOCIAL NETWORK FOR FANS OF
ERYKAH BADU T SAY EUROPEAN
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE WITH
120 MILLION MEMBERS WHICH
CONDUCTED A POLL THAT RANKED
GERMANEE AS THE WORLD'S
LEAST FUNNY COUNTRY.
WHAT?
GERMANNEE NOT FUNNY, REALLY?
THEY HAVE A BREAKFAST CHEESE
NAMED ONERAMMERGAUER, ALPE
KRAUTER DELIQATESSE.
FRUSTUCK, KASE.
THE FUNNY PART IS BY THE
TIME ARE YOU DONE SAYING IT
THEY HAVE INVADED YOUR
COUNTRY.
(LAUGHTER)
CLEARLY, CLEARLY GERMAN
COMEDY HAS GOT ENA BAD RAP
SO TONIGHT I'M GOING TO
CLEAR THE GERMAN'S GOOD NAME,
HERE TO TICKLE YOUR FUNNY
BONES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE WELCOME GERMAN
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, THE HONORABLE HANS
BEINHOLTZ.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LAST NIGHT I LEFT THE TOILET
SEAT UP.
MY WIFE WAS ENRAGED.
(LAUGHTER)
DOM ES 'TIS SIT A CAGE OF
OUR OWN INVENTION.
THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF GRAPE
NUTS.
THEY ARE NEITHER GRAPES NOR
NUTS.
AND SO THE SAD FARCE
CONTINUES.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THERE ANYONE HERE ON A
FIRST DATE?
LOVE IS AN EMPTY PROMISE.
(LAUGHTER)
TODAY YOU ARE YOUNG, HOLDING
HANDS, THINKING OF THE
FUTURE.
TOMORROW, YOU ARE CLUTCHING
A CADAVER OF YOUR LOVER.
(LAUGHTER)
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
THAT IS MY TIME.
THAT IS ALL OUR TIME.
FOR LIFE IS FLEETING AND
CRUEL.
THE ARISTOCRATS.
>> Stephen: HINES BEINHOLTZ,
EVERYBODY.
HE WILL BE IN THE CITY
ANIMAL SHELTER EUTHANIZING
ROOM FOLLOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
