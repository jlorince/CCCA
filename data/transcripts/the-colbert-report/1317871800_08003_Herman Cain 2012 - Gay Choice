FROM.
SOMEONE SHOULD ASK SANDRA PALIN
ABOUT HIM.
CLEARLY IF HE'S A LEADER, HE'S
AT THE TOP, IF CAIN IS AT THE
TOP, HE'S MY GUY.
I LIKE WHAT HE STANDS FOR.
I WONDER WHAT HE STANDS FOR.
[LAUGHTER]
JIM?
>> HE WOULD LIKE TO ROLL BLACK
GUNS, BRING BACK "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL."
I THINK THAT YOU BELIEVE BEING
GAY IS A CHOICE.
>> YES.
>> AND TO THINK THAT GAY IS A
CHOICE, I DON'T KNOW HOW THE
RESPOND TO THAT.
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK THAT
ANYBODY IN THIS WORLD WANTS TO
BE GAY CONSIDERING ALL OF THE
VILIFICATION THAT IS BROUGHT
UPON SOMEONE WHO IS GAY.
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE THAT?
>> WELL, YOU SHOW ME THE SCIENCE
THAT SAYS THAT IT'S NOT, AND I
COULD BE PERSUADED.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A HUGE
GAFFE FOR CAIN.
A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
ACKNOWLEDGING THE EXISTENCE OF
SCIENCE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOUCH.
THAT'S GOING TO COST HIM A
COUPLE OF POINTS.
OF COURSE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THIS, REPUBLICAN GAY RIGHTS
ORGANIZATION THE LOG CABIN
REPUBLICANS FIRED BACK SAYING,
"THE CLAIM THAT A PERSON CHOOSES
TO BE GAY OR LESBIAN HAS BEEN
DISCREDITED BY EVERY MAJOR
PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL
ORGANIZATION.
AN INDIVIDUAL'S ORIENTATION IS
NO MORE A CHOICE THAN THE COLOR
OF SKIN AND WHETHER HE IS
LEFT-HANDED."
OH REALLY.
I REMEMBER THE MOMENT I CHOSE TO
BE A WHITE CAUCASIAN MALE.
I WAS WALKING PRESIDENT
KNICKSON'S INAUGURATION AND I
THOUGHT, I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT
GUY.
IT WAS NOT EASY TO COME OUT THE
MY LEFT-HANDED, HISPANIC, GAY
PARENTS.
LOS CIENTO, MIS PADRES.
PLUS, FOLKS, IF SKIN COLOR ISN'T
A CHOICE, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
JOHN BOEHNER?
AND, FOLKS, I'M RIGHT-HANDED,
BUT I COULD EASILY CHOOSE TO BE
LEFT-HANDED.
LOOK.
I'LL THROW A BALL WITH MY LEFT
HAND.
LOOK AT THIS.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY.
SEE, JUST AS GOOD AS WHEN I
THROW RIGHT-HANDED.
[LAUGHTER]
AND LISTEN, LISTEN, CHOOSING NOT
TO BE GAY WAS NOT EASY.
NEWS FLASH: HAVING SEX WITH
WOMEN IS NO PICNIC.
OKAY.
IT IS AN UGLY, DIRTY BUSINESS.
FIRST OF ALL, EVERYTHING'S
DIFFERENT DOWN THERE.
OKAY.
GUYS, A LITTLE WARNING: BRING
MANUAL.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY'S UP.
THE POINT IS HERMAN CAIN IS
TELLING US WITH THIS STATEMENT
THAT EVERY DAY HE GETS UP AND
CHOOSES NOT TO BE GAY.
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TOMORROW, BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU,
THERE IS ONE GUY OUT THERE
HERMAN CAIN SEEMS TO HAVE A
CRUSH ON.
IT'S HERMAN CAIN.
HI IS HOT FOR HIMSELF IN HIS NEW
MEMOIR "THIS IS HERMAN CAIN: MY
JOURNEY TO THE WHITE HOUSE."
JUST LISTEN HOW MUCH CAIN
BELIEVES IN HIMSELF.
IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH IN THE
BOOK, HE SAYS, "WELL, I'M JUST
ABOUT AT THE ELEVATOR UP TO THE
FAMILY QUARTERS, BUT BARE WITH
ME FOR JUST A MINUTE MORE AS I
CONFIRM WHO I AM.
IT'S OBVIOUS I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA."
FOLKS, THIS IS A BRILLIANT
STRATEGY.
WITH THAT ONE SENTENCE, CAIN HAS
TAKEN AWAY OBAMA'S STRATEGIC
ADVANTAGE OF BEING AMERICA'S
ONLY PRESIDENT AND BY
FANTASIZING THAT HE IS AMERICA'S
FIRST SECOND BLACK PRESIDENT,
CAIN CLEARLY KNOWS HIS IMAGINARY
PLACE IN HISTORY.
LISTEN TO THIS: "WHEN ALL THE
VOTES WERE COUNTED ON TUESDAY,
NOVEMBER 6, 2012, WE WILL BE
FREE AT LAST, FREE AT, LAST
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY, THIS NATION
WILL BE FREE AT LAST AGAIN.
YES.
BECAUSE WE MUST NOT JUDGE A MAN
BY THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN, BUT BY
THE WAY HE PRETENDS TO HAVE THE
