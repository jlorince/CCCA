( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
NATION, COME ON.
NATION, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, NATION, I GOT TO GET
RIGHT TO THAT.
NATION, YOU ALL KNOW HOW MUCH I
LOVES ME MY GOD.
HE'S GOT A HECK OF A TRACK
RECORD.
WHAT WITH CREATING THE UNIVERSE,
SEPARATING THE LIGHT FROM
DARKNESS, MAKING MAN AND WOMEN,
ALL THE CREATURES OF THE EARTH,
THREE-CHEESE BAGEL BITES.
THREE CHEESE, ONE BAGEL, TWO
BITES.
THERE'S NOTHING THIS GUY CAN'T
DO.
BUT, FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
MY FAITH WAS ROCKED THIS PAST
SUNDAY DURING THE BILLS-STEELERS
GAME WHEN BILLS' WIDE RECEIVER
STEVE JOHNSON DROPPED AN EASY,
GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN PASS IN
OVERTIME.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
HIS HANDS WERE FULL OF FOOTBALL.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW, NORMALLY WHEN SOMEONE BLOWS
A WIDE-OPEN RIGHT IN THE NUMBERS
MUFFIN LIKE THAT, THERE'S A
SIMPLE EXPLANATION: HUMAN ERROR.
TURNS OUT NOT THIS TIME.
YOU SEE, JOHNSON HIT HIS TWITTER
FEED TO FINGER THE REAL CULPRIT.
GOD TWEETING:
I PRAISE YOU 24/7!!!
AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO ME!!!
YOU EXPECT ME TO LEARN FROM
THIS???
HOW???
I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS!!
EVER!!
THX THO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
GOD MISSED THAT CATCH.
I APPLAUD STEVE JOHNSON FOR
CALLING THE OLD MAN OUT.
HEY, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
HEARD ATHLETES THANK GOD FOR
VICTORY?
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR HE STEP
UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN
HE BLOWS A BIG ONE.
FOLKS, THIS RAISES SERIOUS
QUESTIONS.
MAYBE GOD'S PAST HIS PRIME.
I SAID IT.
EVERYBODY IS THINKING IT.
HE IS GETTING UP THERE.
HOW OLD IS HE NOW?
INFINITE?
HIS KNEES HAVE GOT TO BE SHOT.Ã‘i
NOW MAYBE GOD CAN'T WIN OUR
FOOTBALL GAMES FOR US ANYMORE.
MAYBE HE NEED TO TAKE PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN
LIVES, ACCEPT OUR SUCCESSES AND
OUR FAILURES WITH GRACE AND
HUMILITY.
OR I CAN DUMP GOD FROM MY
FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
STAY DOWN HERE.
SORRY, CHIEF.
SORRY, CHIEF.
IT'S TIME TO HIT THE BIG BENCH
IN THE SKY.
ALL RIGHT.
KALI, YOU'RE IN.
I BET THIS GUY WILL NEVER DROP A
CATCH.
