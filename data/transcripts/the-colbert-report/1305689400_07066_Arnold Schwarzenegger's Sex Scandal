>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER A BIG
STORY HITS, I KNOW THE FIRST
THING YOU DO IS TUNE IN HERE TO
FIND OUT HOW YOU FEEL.
THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN YOU HATE
TERRORISTS, MONORAILS AND MY
PERVERT NEIGHBOR ALAN, WHO IS
ALWAYS TRYING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE
OF ME NAKED WHEN I'M MOWING THE
FRONT LAWN.
SO NATURALLY PEOPLE ARE
EXPECTING ME TO WEIGH IN ON
TODAY'S BIG BOMBSHELL.
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.
>> FORMER GOVERNOR ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER ADMITTING HE
FATHERED A LOVE CHILD ROUGHLY A
DECADE AGO WITH A FORMER STAFF
MEMBER.
>> Stephen: JUICY, SEXY STUFF.
WELL, FOLKS, I HATE TO
DISAPPOINT YOU, BUT I AM NOT
TOUCHING THIS ONE.
IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN
ARNOLD AND HIS FAMILY AND HIS
OTHER FAMILY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HERE.
IF YOU WANT ALL THE LURID
DETAILS, GO SOMEPLACE ELSE
BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO TALK ABOUT, LIKE OIL
SUBSIDIES.
TODAY THE SENATE VOTED ON A
DEMOCRATIC MEASURE THAT WOULD
ELIMINATE $21 BILLION IN
SUBSIDIES FOR THE COUNTRY'S TOP
FIVE OIL COMPANIES OVER THE NEXT
DECADE.
THE BILL CLOSES CERTAIN
LOOPHOLES IN THE TAX CODE,
SPECIFICALLY THE PART OF THE
CODE THAT -- TEN YEARS, TEN
YEARS AGO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HE HAD THIS KID.
OKAY.
AND MARIA NEVER KNEW?
WHAT DID SHE THINK THIS WAS,
WATER WEIGHT GAIN?
NO, NO, NO, COLBERT, YOU'RE
BETTER THAN THIS.
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.
MOSTLY.
I HEAR HE'S PART MACHINE.
SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF.
OIL SUBSIDIES.
YEAH.
OKAY.
AS I WAS SAYING, REPUBLICANS
ARGUE THAT RATHER THAN BLAMING
BIG OIL FOR RECORD PROFITS,
CONGRESS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON
INCREASING DOMESTIC ENERGY
PRODUCTION AND -- ARE YOU
TELLING ME NO ONE KNEW?
NO ONE KNEW IT WAS HIS KID?
IT WAS PROBABLY BORN WITH A
40-INCH CHEST.
AND FORGET THE CAESAREAN, HE
PROBABLY SHOT HIS WAY OUT, HASTA
LA VISTA, PLACENTA.
I NEED HELP.
NO, I NEED HELP.
I NEED HELP, HELP.
[GRUNTING]
GET YOURSELF TOGETHER.
FOCUS, FOCUS, FOCUS, FOCUS.
YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOOD TO GO.
I'M GOOD TO GO.
OKAY.
AND REPUBLICANS ARE NOT TAKING
THIS LYING DOWN, FOLKS.
THEY INTRODUCED THEIR OWN BILL
FM 953, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS,
"SECTION ONE, SHORT TITLE: THIS
ACT MAY BE CITED AS THE "OFF
SHORE PRODUCTION AND SAFETY ACT
OF 2011... IN GENERAL,
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
PROVISION OF THIS ACT, IN THE
CASE OF EACH EXPLORATION PLAN
SUBMITTED AFTER THE DATE OF
ENACTMENT OF THIS ACT,
[BLEEPED].
OKAY.
LET'S DISH.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS WHOLE THING MAKES JOHN
EDWARDS LOOK LIKE FATHER OF THE
YEAR.
I MEAN, I MEAN, WHEN ARNOLD WAS
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, HE WAS OUT
THERE SHAKING HANDS AND KISSING
BABIES.
ANY OF THOSE BABIES COULD HAVE
BEEN HIS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW WE KNOW WHY HE WAS ALWAYS
SMOKING CIGARS.
EACH ONE COULD HAVE BEEN
CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF ANOTHER
SECRET CHILD.
OH, I CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE
TALKING ABOUT THIS.
>> THIS IS A MARRIAGE
TERMINATOR.
>> FROM TERMINATOR TO...
>> DID WE CALL HIM THE
INSEMINATOR?
>> MAYBE IT'S A TUMOR.
>> IT'S NOT A TUMOR.
>> HE'S GOING TO GET A LOT OF
MONEY AND JINGLE ALL THE WAY.
>> NOW HE HAS A JUNIOR, AS HE
SAID.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST
ACTION HERO TO DO THIS.
AND NOW WHEN HE TURNS FIVE HE'S
GOING TO BE A KINDERGARTEN COP.
>> HILARIOUS.
HEY, SORRY.
ANYWAY, WHERE WAS I?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES, OIL IS THE KEY TO THE
FUTURE.
[LAUGHTER]
