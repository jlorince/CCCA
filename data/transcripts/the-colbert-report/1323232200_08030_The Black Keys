WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!
MY GUESTS TONIGHT WON THREE
GRAMMY THIS IS YEAR.
WOW!
ONE MORE AND THAT'S FOUR!
PLEASE WELCOME THE BLACK KEYS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DAN, PATRICK, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
THOSE LIGHTS TRIED TO KILL ME.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK.
THE ALBUM YOU WON THREE GRAMMYS
FOR THIS YEAR IS CALLED
"BROTHERS," RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, WELCOME TO THE
CLUB!
WELCOME TO THE GRAMMY CLUB.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
I WON A GRAMMY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> CONGRATULATIONS.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WASN'T FISHING FOR THAT BUT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS ON
MAINTENANCE OR ANYTHING?
>> YEAH WHAT DO YOU USE TO
POLISH IT?
>> Stephen: A SHAMIE, AND FEED
IT NOTHING BUT BABY FOOD.
THE NEW ALBUM IS CALLED "EL
COMINO."
ALL RIGHT, WHY... WHY THE
HISPANIC INFLUENCE?
WHY NOT "THAT COMINO"?
(LAUGHTER)
>> ACTUALLY, WE THOUGHT IT
SOUNDED LIKE A COOL WORD.
>> IT IS COOL!
IT'S A TOTALLY COOL WORD.
WHEN I WAS A KID, EL COMINO WAS
THE COOL CAR.
>> RIGHT.
WE SAW AN ELKO KHA MENO WHEN WE
WERE ON TOUR AND WE THOUGHT "HEY
WHY DON'T WE CALL THE RECORD EL
COMINO."
>> Stephen: THERE SO THERE'S A
BACK STORY.
(LAUGHTER)
ARE YOUR SONGS THAT DEEP?
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> THERE'S DEEPER MEANING NOW
BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR TOUR VAN.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S NOT AN EL
COMINO.
>> EL COMINO MEANS THE ROAD OR
THE PATH.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> NEITHER DID WE.
WE FOUND THAT OUT.
>> SO YOU'VE MADE THE DECISION
AND MADE IT SOUND MEANINGFUL
LATER?
>> WE DIDN'T MAKE IT SOUND
MEANINGFUL.
WE... WE ACCIDENTALLY WALKED
INTO THAT.
WE FOUND THE MEANING LATER AND
PRETENDED IT WAS MEANINGFUL.
YEAH.
>> Stephen: WELL, I LOVE THAT
IT'S NOT ONLY AN EL COMINO, NONE
OF THE PHOTOS, NONE OF THEM, ARE
EL COMINOS.
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE IN AKRON,
OHIO, WHERE WE'RE FROM.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS ARING FROM
AKRON!
AKRON, DOES IT HAVE A BIG MUSIC
SCENE IN IS AKRON LIKE ITS OWN
MOTOWN?
AKRON MAKES TIRES, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, IT'S A THE RUBBER
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: IT'S PART OF THE MO
OF MOTOWN?
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT
BANDS THAT CAME FROM THERE BUT
IT'S SORT OF... DEPRESSED
ECONOMY, NOT A LOT GOING ON.
>> Stephen: WE WOULD HAVE TO...
>> WE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE TO
CLEVELAND TO PLAY SHOWS.
THERE'S NO CLUBS.
>> Stephen: NO CLUBS IN AKRON.
>> THEY'D GO OUT OF BUSINESS
EVERY YEAR.
>> Stephen: YOU DREW A CROWD.
>> WE LOVE AKRON.
IT'S JUST... YEAH, IT'S A
SMALLER TOWN IN THE MIDWEST AND,
YOU KNOW... YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NO, STOP RIGHT
THERE.
LATER WE'LL FIND OUT THAT THAT
MEANS SOMETHING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THERE'S A LOT OF CHEESE
BERGERS THERE.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
PRESSURE OF STARDOM BECAUSE YOU
GUYS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE
MOON RIGHT NOW.
OKAY?
THIS TIME LAST YEAR YOU WERE
BEARDY AND GLASSES, THE ROCK 'N'
ROLL GUYS.
NOW YOU ARE THE BLACK KEYS!
TRIPLE GRAMMY WINNERS!
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS
SCRUTINIZED.
EVERY NOTE.
IS THERE ANY PRESSURE KNOWING
THAT ANY MOMENT THE STAR SHIP
COULD CRASH?
>> UM, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH
THAT FRESH INJURY?
>> WE JUST TRY TO IGNORE IT.
>> Stephen:LY NOT LET YOU.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE
BROADCASTING THIS TONIGHT.
>> REALLY?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
A LOT OF BANTDZ WE DON'T.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOU GUYS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: I HAVEN'T HEARD THE
NEW ALBUM, WHAT CAN I SNEX IS
THERE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT
THIS FROM "BROTHERS"?
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS BLUESY
SOULFUL ROUGH ROCK 'N' ROLL
SOUND.
>> THERE'S LESS OF THE
SOULFUL... LESS SLOWER SONGS,
MORE UP TEMPO.
BUT DEFINITELY STILL SOUNDS LIKE
US.
>> Stephen: MORE UP TEMPO.
SO A LOT OF MY AUDIENCE WATCHES
THE SHOW WITH MUTE ON.
SO ARE THE SONGS MORE LIKE...
(LAUGHTER)
OR ARE THEY MORE LIKE...
(LAUGHTER)
>> DEFINITELY THE FIRST ONE.
>> Stephen: OR MAYBE MORE
LIKE...
>>
>> YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> MORE LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: GOD, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GREAT ALBUM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU GUYS FOR YEARS JUST DROVE
AROUND IN LIKE A BAND WITH NO
HEAT... VAN WITH NO HEAT, RIGHT?
>> A VAN WITH NO AIR
CONDITIONING.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN.
DO YOU ENJOY THIS LEVEL OF
SUCCESS?
OBVIOUSLY MONEY IS GOOD BUT DO
YOU LIKE BEING FAMOUS?
BECAUSE I LOVE IT.
I'D RATHER BE FAMOUS THAN
RESPECTED.
(LAUGHTER)
>>
>> I DON'T KNOW, WE'RE NOT TOO
COMFORTABILITY WITH, LIKE, DOING
FAMOUS THINGS.
>> Stephen: GROUPIES...
>> INTERVIEWS....
>> Stephen: GROUPIES, ROCK 'N'
ROLL, HOT AND COLD RUNNING TAIL.
(LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY?
SERIOUSLY?
COME ON, I BET YOU GUYS ARE
BEATING THEM OFF WITH A STICK!
(LAUGHTER)
JUST BE HONEST, I WON'T
BROADCAST THIS PART.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
DAN AUERBACH AND PATRICK CARNEY,
THE BLACK KEYS.
