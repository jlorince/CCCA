>> FOLKS, I GOT TO TILL T IS GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US BUT IT IS NOT GOOD TO BE HERE.
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT IS NOT SHOW TIME.
BECAUSE I REFUSE TO BOW TO THE BIG GOVERNMENT CHRONO-NAZIS AND THEIR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.
NO WASHINGTON BUREAUCRAT TELLS ME HOW TO A RUST-- ADJUST THE TILT OF THE EARTH'S AXIS.
I TELL YOU, FOLKS, THIS IS JUST BARACK OBAMA STEALING AN HOUR OF MY LIFE TO REDISTRIBUTE IT TO POOR PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) I KNOW THEY SAY, THEY SAY,
YEAH--  (APPLAUSE) THEY SAY-- YEAH, I CLAP WHEN I'M ANGRY TOO.
YES.
(LAUGHTER) THEY SAY YOU GET YOUR HOUR BACK IN THE FALL, BUT WHOSE'S EARNING THE INTEREST
ON THAT HOUR IN THE MEANTIME?
THE UNIONS, THAT'S WHO.
HOW ELSE DOES HE GET THOSE LUNCH BREAKS.
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT IS STILL 10:30 AND I'M NOT JUST GOING TO SIT HERE
