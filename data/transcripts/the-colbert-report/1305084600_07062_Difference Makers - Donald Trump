(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
NATION, IT'S NO SECRET THAT
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DEAR TO ME
THAN THE AMERICAN FLAG.
THAT'S WHY IF ANYTHING EVER
HAPPENS TO ME, MY FLAG,
FLAGWORTH, IS THE SOLE
BENEFICIARY OF MY LIFE INSURANCE
POLICY.
(LAUGHTER)
SADLY, ALL ACROSS AMERICA OUR
FLAGS ARE COMING UNDER ATTACK.
WELL, THREE YEARS AGO WE
PROFILED A HERO WHO'S FIGHTING
FOR FLAG RIGHTS.
TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN HE IS OUR
DIFFERENCE MAKER.
THIS IS RANCHO PAL LOS VARY
DAYS, A TOWN IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA WITH ONLY WEALTH AND
A SPECTACULAR COASTLINE GOING
FOR IT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT WHAT IT LACKS THE MOST WAS
AN ENORMOUS FLAGPOLE.
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.
NOW IT'S GOT 70 FEET OF STEEL
HARD POLE.
(LAUGHTER)
THRUSTING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE
AMERICAN SKY.
ARCHING ITSELF TOWARD THE
HEIGHTS OF FREEDOM.
YEARNING FOR THE APEX OF LIBERTY
AND ELEVATED SYMBOL OF ALL THAT
IS RIGHT WITH OUR COUNTRY.
A POLE THAT TAPERS TO A HEROIC
CONSUMMATION DIPPED AND TOPPED
BY A THROBBING BRASS... THERE WE
GO.
WHAT!
WHOO, THAT'S THE KIND OF POLE TO
GIVE OLD GLORY THE PERCH SHE
DESERVES.
WHAT THE SHELL THAT?
I SAID OLD GLORY, NOT OLD DISH
RAG!
YEAH!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
400 SQUARE FEET OF FREEDOM.
ENOUGH TO PARK THREE HUMMERS
WITH ROOM TO SPARE FOR 345 LARGE
ORDERS OF FRIES.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND
GENEROSITY TO ERECT SUCH A HUGE
POLE?
A RECLUSIVE PATRIOT WHO
RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO SPEAK WITH
US ON THE CONDITION HE REMAIN
ANONYMOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
CONCERNED FOR THIS DEPRIVED
COMMUNITY, MR. TRUMP SELFLESSLY
ERECTED THE FLAGPOLE ON A GOLF
COURSE THAT HE, COINCIDENTALLY,
OWNS.
HE LOVES THE FLAG.
>> I'M A GOLFER, I LOVE GOLF AND
I HIT BALLS AND I LOVE TO HIT
BALLS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: ALMOST AS MUCH AS
HE LOVES THE FLAG.
>> I BUILT THE NUMBER-ONE RATED
GOLF COURSE IN THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER COURSE.
BETTER THAN PEBBLE BEACH.
>> Stephen: MR. TRUMP IS
MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE FACE
OF FIERCE OPPOSITION FROM AN
OPPRESSIVE REGIME.
>> A FLAGPOLE IS NOT PRESENTLY
LEGAL.
>> Stephen: DOUG STERN IS THE
MAYOR OF RANCHO PALACE VERDE AND
THIS IS HIS IDEA OF A BIG FLAG.
(LAUGHTER).
>> WE BASICALLY REGULATE
EVERYTHING IN OUR CITY WITHOUT A
VARIANCE TO A HEIGHT OF 16 FEET.
>> Stephen: 16 FEET.
>> WHOEVER HEARD OF SUCH A
THING?
>> TRUMP, OF COURSE, BELIEVES HE
DOESN'T NEED A PERMIT TO PUT UP
A FLAG.
>> YOU DON'T NEED A PERMIT TO
PUT UP THE AMERICAN FLAG.
>> Stephen: BUT MAYOR "HATES
THE FLAG" SEEMS HUNG UP ON
OBEYING THE LAW.
>> THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN
INDIVIDUAL DECIDING THEY SIMPLY
ARE ABOVE THE LAW.
>> Stephen: EVEN WHEN THE LAW
IS WRONG?
ROSA PARKS TAUGHT US...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO OPPOSE AN
UNJUST LAW, BUT THE MAYOR SAYS
ROSA PARKS IS A CRIMINAL.
>> I HAVE NEVER SAID ROSA PARKS
IS A CRIMINAL.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?
LET'S CHECK THE TAPE.
>> ROSA PARKS IS A CRIMINAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ALL THIS UNWANTED
ATTENTION COMES AS A SHOCK TO
THIS SHY PHILANTHROPIST
>> I AM SHOCKED FOR PEOPLE TO BE
ASKING ME TO RIP DOWN THE
AMERICAN FLAG IS PRETTY TOUGH.
>> MR. TRUMP HAS CERTAINLY
ACCUSED ME OF HAVING THE DESIRE
TO RIP DOWN THE AMERICAN FLAG.
>> THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY'RE
DOING.
THEY'RE RIPPING DOWN THE
AMERICAN FLAG.
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
WANT THIS.
>> YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO PUT
UP A HUGE FLAG JUST BECAUSE YOU
CAN.
>> Stephen: MR. MAYOR, IF
THERE'S ONE THING AMERICANS
KNOW: SIZE MATTERS.
WHEN IT COMES TO FLAGS OR
ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAVES IN THE
BREEZE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT MAYOR STERNS DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DENYING
MR. TRUMP HIS POLE IS VERY
UN-AMERICAN.
>> IT REALLY IS RIDICULOUS.
>> Stephen: AND?
>> AND VERY UN-AMERICAN.
>> Stephen: BUT THIS
DIFFERENCE MAKER IS NOT GOING TO
GIVE UP THE FIGHT.
>> I LOVE FIGHTING FOR THE FLAG.
>> Stephen: IT'S ALL HE TALKS
ABOUT.
>> THE NUMBER-ONE GOLF COURSE IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
>> Stephen: YEAH, IT'S A NICE
COURSEMENT BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THIS FLAG.
AND ITS MESSAGE OF FREEDOM, A
MESSAGE AS IMPORTANT TO DONALD
TRUMP AS IT WAS TO THE 13
ORIGINAL COLONIES.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 13
STRIPES REPRESENT
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: STILL, IT'S A NICE
COURSE.
>> THE NUMBER-ONE
