WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A CONTROVERSIAL ARTICLE FOR THE ATLANTIC MAGAZINE ON
WHETHER WOMEN CAN HAVE BOTH A CAREER AND A FAMILY.
THE ANSWER YES.
THE CAREER AND FAMILY AND SLEEP, NO.
PLEASE WELCOME ANNE MARIE SLAUGHTER.
MEERS PLAUS DESH --
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: NOW FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT REMEMBER YOUR APPEARANCE FIVE YEARS AGO,
LET ME CATCH THE PEOPLE UP ON YOU.
ARE YOU PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PROFESSOR AT PRINCETON.
DIRECTOR FOR POLICY PLANNING FOR HILLARY CLINTON FOR TWO YEARS, DEAN OF PRINCETON'S
WOODROW WILSON SCHOOL.
YOU WROTE THIS COVER ARTICLE FOR THE ATLANTIC, WHY WOMEN STILL CAN'T HAVE IT ALL.
OKAY.
FIRST OF ALL I CAN POINT OUT,
YOU SEE THIS, YOU SEE THAT.
NOW WHEN I CARRY NAKED BABY IN MY BRIEFCASE, I GET IN TROUBLE.
BUT ITS'S OKAY FOR A WOMAN TO DO IT, OKAY.
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE THAT MEN DON'T HAVE.
SO WHAT IS IT THAT WOMEN CAN'T HAVE ALL OF.
SO THEY HEAR THAT PHRASE A LOT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
>> SO IT IS HAVING THE SAME CAREER CHOICES TO BE ABLE TOO HAVE A CAREER AND A
FAMILY, AS A MAN DOES.
SO HAVING IT ALL.
>> Stephen: WHY CAN'T YOU HAVE IT.
>> YOU-- IF YOU-- .
>> Stephen: IT'S A CHOICE,
YOU HAVE FREE WILL.
>> YOU HAVE FREE WILL.
>> Stephen: HAVE 2.
>> BUT YOU NEED-- .
>> Stephen: HAVE ALL OF IT.
>> YOU NEED TO BE ABLE-- A MAN CAN HAVE A CAREER AND CAN HAVE A FAMILY AND THE
FAMILY IS NOT AN OBSTACLE TO THE MAN'S CAREER.
>> Stephen: HOW IS IT AN ON STACK TELL TO A WOMAN.
WHAT IS IT THAT SUPPOSED THING THAT IS KEEPING A WOMAN FROM SUCCEEDING.
>> SO IN THE FIRST PLACE WOMEN ARE SUCCEEDING ENORMOUSLY BUT THE ONES WHO
ARE REALLY MAKING IT WORK WITH RESPECT TO HAVING A FAMILY AND BEING THE KIND OF
PARENT THEY WANT TO BE AND HAVING A CAREER AND HAVING THEIR CAREER AMBITIONS ARE
GENERALLY EITHER SUPERHUMAN,
THEY DON'T SLEEP, RICH, THEY HAVE HELP AROUND THE CLOCK.
>> Stephen: IT IS HANDY.
>> OR SELF-EMPLOYED SO I'M A PROFESSOR AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BASICALLY
CONTROL MY OWN TIME.
SO I CAN HAVE A FAMILY AND HAVE A FULL CAREER AND MAKE IT WORK.
BUT FOR MOST WORKING WOMEN,
THE DEMANDS OF TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF KIDS-- THEY NEED BETTER CHOICES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ASSUMING THAT WOMEN CARE ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES MORE THAN MEN DO.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NO, LISTEN, I'M A PARENT, YOU'RE A PARENT.
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL BUT I CAN HAVE IT ALL?
WHAT IS THE THING THAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.
>> WELL, IN THE FIRST PLACE WOMEN ARE STILL DOING TWO-THIRDS OF THE HOUSEWORK.
>> Stephen: BUT DON'T.
>> AND TWO-THIRDS OF THE CHILD CARE.
>> Stephen: BUT DON'T, DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO THAT, DON'T-- I DON'T --
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE MOST RED ARTICLE-- READ ARTICLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE ATLANTIC.
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS HAS STRUCK SUCH A NERVE WITH PEOPLE.
>> BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE WHO ARE STRETCHED ABSOLUTELY TO THE
BREAKING POINT WITHOUT FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW THEY WANT TO BE, THEY LIVE UP TO THEIR CAREER AMBITIONS.
THEY KNOW THEY WANT TO BE PARENTS.
THEY CAN'T MAKE IT WORK.
THEY'RE BLAMING THEMSELVES.
THIS IS AN ARTICLE THAT SAYS NOPE, IT'S NOT YOU.
WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF BLAMING YOURSELF-- ARE YOU AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE
ANSWER TO THIS, ARE YOU A GOOD MOTHER OR ARE YOU A BAD MOTHER?
AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE ANSWERS IS JUST A LIE YOU TELL YOURSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHAT IN YOUR HEART DO YOU THINK YOU ARE FOR THE CHOICES YOU'VE MADE?
>> I THINK I'M A VERY GOOD MOM BUT PART OF BEING A GOOD MOM WAS COMING HOME FROM
WASHINGTON AFTER TWO YEARS EVEN THOUGH I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE STAYED AND
DONE MORE FOREIGN POLICY,
SOMETHING I'VE TRAINED MYSELF TO DO ALL MY LIFE.
BUT YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TWO TEENAGERS AND HONESTLY ANY PARENT OF TEENAGERS KNOWS
IT'S A LOT EASIER WITH TWO PARENTS ON DECK.
>> Stephen: THERE IS TWO-- RIGHT THERE YOU SEE THAT, SEE THAT, HERE'S HOW I
CAN PROVE THAT ARE YOU A GOOD MOTHER.
NEATH OF THEM LOOK LIKE THEY WANT TO BE IN THE PICTURE.
THAT MEANS YOU'VE RAISED TWO NORMAL BOYS.
(LAUGHTER) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: ANN-MARIE SLAUGHTER, YOU CAN READ HER ARTICLE Y WOMEN CAN'T HAVE
IT ALL IN THIS MONTH'S THE
