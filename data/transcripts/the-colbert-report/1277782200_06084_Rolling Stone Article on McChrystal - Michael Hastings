NATION, WE WERE ALL SHOCKED BY
THE BOMBSHELL DROPPED IN THE
LATEST ISSUE OF THE "ROLLING
STONE" MAGAZINE.
OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT ART
GARFUNKEL POSTPONING THE SIMON
AND GARFUNKEL SUMMER REUNION
TOUR.
GREAT.
NOW THIS SUMMER THE ONLY SOUND
OF SILENCE WE'LL HEAR ARE THE
ACTUAL SOUNDS OF SILENCE.
[LAUGHTER]
UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE COULD STEP
IN.
♪♪
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
♪ SILENCE ♪♪
>> Stephen: PAUL, CALL ME.
I LOOK GREAT IN A BLONGSD BLONDE
AFRO.
OF COURSE, THE MAGAZINE ALSO
CONTAINED A LITTLE ARTICLE IN
WHICH OUR COMMANDER IN
AFGHANISTAN, STANLEY
McCHRYSTAL, AND HIS AIDES MADE
COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND
VICE PRESIDENT.
SO OBAMA FIRED HIS FOUR-STAR
ASS.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
A FIVE-STAR ASS, THAT'S RIGHT
HERE ON THE COVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CLOSE UP
WAS NECESSARY...
[LAUGHTER]
BUT BESIDES THE GOSSIPY
BEHIND-THE-SCENES NAME-CALLING,
THERE WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE
ARTICLE I FOUND DISTURBING, THE
ARTICLE PART.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU SEE, MOST OF IT WASSING
ABOUT McCHRYSTAL'S
CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGY KNOWN AS
COUNTER-INSURGENCY OR COIN.
THAT MAKES OUR SOLDIERS NATION
BUILDERS, OR AS THE ARTICLE
SAYS, "THINK GREEN BERETS AS AN
ARMED PEACE CORPS."
WELL, E-MAIL SORRY, PEACE IS NOT
THE GREEN BERET'S THING.
THAT'S THE RASPBERRY BERETS.
FOLKS, COIN IS GIVING OUR
SOLDIERS THE LAUDABLE GOAL OF
LOWERING CIVILIAN CASUALTY, BUT
HEY, WE'RE TRYING WIN A WAR
HERE, AND I SAY YOU CAN'T MAKE
AN OMLETTE WITHOUT KILLING
SOMEBODY WHO HAS AN OMLETTE.
SO FRANKLY, I AM GLAD
McCHRYSTAL'S OUT OF.
THERE I MEAN, HIS OWN CHIEF OF
OPERATIONS SAID THAT EVEN IF
COIN WORKS, "IT'S NOT GOING TO
LOOK LIKE A WIN, SMELL LIKE A
WIN OR TASTE LIKE A WIN."
COME ON!
IF WE CAN MAKE YOGURT TASTE LIKE
SPONGE BOB, I THINK WE CAN MAKE
AFGHANISTAN TASTE LIKE
VICTORYBERRY BLAST.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS.
NOW, THANKFULLY PRESIDENT OBAMA
HAS NAMED A NEW AFGHAN FLAVOR
SAVER, GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS.
PLEASE BE SEATED.
AND PETRAEUS IS GOING TO CHANGE
EVERYTHING.
>> THERE'S IN CHANGE TO THE
OVERALL WAR STRATEGY.
>> GENERAL PETRAEUS UNDERSTANDS
THAT STRATEGY BECAUSE HE HELPED
SHAPE IT.
>> COUNTER-INSURGENCY WILL
CONTINUE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I CALL
LEADERSHIP, DO THE SAME THING
AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS.
SO McCHRYSTAL'S OUT.
PETRAEUS IS IN.
NOTHING CHANGES.
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THIS
GUY WROTE THIS "ROLLING STONE"
ARTICLE.
HERE TO TELL ME WHY THIS GUY
WROTE THIS "ROLLING STONE"
ARTICLE, PLEASE WELCOME THIS
GUY, MICHAEL HASTINGS.
MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, MICHAEL, WHY DID YOU WRITE
THIS ARTICLE?
YOU GOT McCHRYSTAL OUT OF
THERE.
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU WANTED?
>> I WROTE THE ARTICLE TO BRING
ATTENTION TO THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN.
IT'S USUALLY VERY UNDERCOVERRED
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF
JOURNALISTS THERE DOING GREAT
WORK.
I HAD NO AGENDA TO GET
McCHRYSTAL FIRED.
I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS FIREABLE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU FEEL ANY
RESPONSIBILITY FOR UPSETTING THE
CHAIN OF COMMAND IN A TIME OF
WAR.
>> THE KEY QUESTION IS I DIDN'T
FIRE McCHRYSTAL.
THE WHITE HOUSE FIRED
McCHRYSTAL.
I BELIEVE THEY USED THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF
SOMEBODY THEY WEREN'T HAPPY
WITH.
>> Stephen: THESE GENERALS HAD
NO DEFENSE AGAINST YOU.
ALL THEY DO IS FIGHT TERRORISTS.
THEY'RE NOT READY TO FIGHT A
JOURNALIST.
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM.
THEY'RE INNOCENT.
>> NO, WHEN YOU WALK AROUND WITH
TAPE RECORDER AND A NOTEBOOK,
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED WHEN
YOUR QUOTES SHOW UP IN PARIS
HILTON.
>> Stephen: GOOD QUESTION.
YOU'RE WALKING AROUND IN
AFGHANISTAN WITH ALL THESE
SOLDIERS AND YOUR NOTE PAD.
WHAT'S A REPORTER WRITING A
STORY FOR "ROLLING STONE" DOING
HANGING OUT WITH OUR TROOPS IN
AFGHANISTAN?
AND AS A FOLLOW-UP, WHAT ARE OUR
TROOPS HANGING OUT IN
AFGHANISTAN FOR?
>> WELL, THE "ROLLING STONE"
REACHED THE DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE A
LOT OF THE PEOPLE FIGHTING THE
WAR WOULD READ.
THE AVERAGE "ROLLING STONE"
READER IS ABOUT 30.
A LOT OF YOUNG OFFICERS READ
"ROLLING STONE."
"GENERATION KILL" WAS DONE AT
"ROLLING STONE" AND MADE INTO A
TV MINISERIES.
THERE'S DEFINITELY A FAN BASE
THERE.
AS FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING IN
AFGHANISTAN, THAT'S ACTUALLY THE
SUBSTANCE OF THE ARTICLE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, THIS COIN, THIS
COUNTER-INSURGENCY STRATEGY, YOU
SAY THE SOLDIERS DON'T LIKE IT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHAT DON'T THEY
LIKE ABOUT IT?
>> THEY DON'T LIKE THEY HAVE
RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR WAR OF
FORCE.
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIGHT THE
WAR THAN THEY LIKE.
>> Stephen: THESE SOLDIERS ARE
MORE READY TO FIGHT.
THE GENERALS ARE LOSING THIS.
>> THE SOLDIERS WOULD PUT IT
THAT WAY.
>> Stephen: WHO IS ULTIMATELY
RESPONSIBLE?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ULTIMATELY
RESPONSIBLE.
>> Stephen: SHOULDN'T HE CALL
FOR HIS OWN RESIGNATION ON THIS
ONE?
>> I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A TOUGH
SELL.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK THIS IS
A FAIR SHAKE?
>> FOR SURE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: IS IT THE ROLE OF
THE PRESS TO REPORT WHAT A
GENERAL SAYS EVEN IF THE GENERAL
LATER SAYS, "PLEASE DON'T PRINT
THAT," BECAUSE THEY DID SAY
DON'T PRINT SOME OF THE THINGS
THEY SAID, RIGHT?
DID THEY ASK THAT?
>> TWO MONTHS LATER BEFORE THE
STORY WAS TO GO TO PRINT, I HAD
A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL'S PRESS
AIDE, DID HE SAY, DON'T PRINT
THE STUFF...
>> HE SAID, HEY, CAN YOU KNOW
ALL THE STUFF YOU SAW AND HEARD,
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT PRINT THAT.
>> Stephen: DID YOU EVER CALL
NO BACKSIES?
>> I DID NOT.
>> Stephen: YOU SHOULD NOT
HAVE PRINTED IT, SIR.
MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
MICHAEL HASTI
