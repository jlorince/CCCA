(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THEREPORT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU BE EVERYBODY,GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEVEEN, STEPHEN!
>> THANK YOU, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
WITH US.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALLAROUND THE WORLD, STUFF.
YOU WATCH THE SHOW.
I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOUDO.
BECAUSE YOU ONE THING I SAIDOVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT
I LOVE WEST VIRGINIA.
IT IS MY FAVORITE OF THEDIRECTIONAL VIRGINIAS.
STEP IT UP, EASTERN SOUTH.
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
I WAS SO CONCERNED WHEN THELIBERAL MEDIA MADE A BIG
STINK OUT OF A MERELY LARGESTINK.
JIM?
>> SOME 300,000 PEOPLE INWEST VIRGINIA ARE FACING NOW
A FIFTH DAY WITHOUT TAPWATER AFTER A CHEMICAL SPILL
CONTAMINATED THEIR WATERSUPPLY.
>> THE ONLY APPROPRIATE USEIS TOILET FLUSHING.
SO FLUSHING YOUR COMMODEWOULD BE APPROPRIATE BUT
DON'T MAKE BABY FORMULA WITHIT, DON'T BRUSH YOUR TEETH
WITH IT, DON'T WASH WITH IT,DON'T SHOWER WITH IT.
>> A GROUP OF WESTVIRGINIAIANS WHONT WHO CAN'T
SHOWER, BRUSH THEIR TEETH ORFEED THEIR BABIES, YOU'VE
GOT YOUR NEXT HIT.
FOLKS, THE LEAK'S TOXIN ISSOMETHING CALLED
4-METHYLCYCLOHEXANE METHANOLWHICH IS USED TO WASH COAL
BEFORE IT GOES TO MARKET INSOMETHING CALLED THE FROTH
FLOTATION PROCESS AND CAUSESNAUSEA, VOMITING AND
DIARRHEA.
SO WHETHER YOU ARE A LUMP OFCOAL OR A HUMAN, EXPECT SOME
FROTH FLOTATION.
(LAUGHTER)NOW THE CHEMICAL CAME FROM A
STORAGE FACILITY RUN BYSOMETHING CALLED FREEDOM
INDUSTRIES.
TO WEST VIRGINIAIANS, IFYOU'VE GOT UNCONTROLLABLE
VOMITING AND DIARRHEA, LETFREEDOM RAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW THE LIBERALS DON'T
POISON THE RIVER CROWD HASDEMONIZED THIS PATRIOTIC
COMPANY BUT THEIR C.E.O.
GARY SOUTHERN REASSUREDLOCALS THAT ALL IS FINE IN
HIS DISTINCTIVE SOUTHERNACCENT.
>> WE HAVE MITIGATEDDED RISK,WE BELIEVE.
OF MATERIAL LEAVING THEFACILITY AND OUR MISSION NOW
IS TO CLEAN UP, THANK YOUVERY MUCH.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: WELL, THAT HITS
THE SPOT.
EXPLAINING WHY 300,000PEOPLE NO LONGER HAVE A
WATER SUPPLY IS THIRSTYWORK.
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED ABOUT.
4-METHYL CYCLO HEXANEMETHANOL SHOULD BE VERY
POPULAR IN WEST VIRGINIA,FOR PETE'S SAKE IT'S GOT TWO
METHS IN THERE.
BESIDES-- I HAVE IT ON GOODAUTHORITY THAT IT IS
PERFECTLY SAFE.
>> THE CHEMICAL HAS A VERY,VERY LOW TOXICITY.
IT HAS NO EFFECT ON AQUATICLIFE SO THERE IS NO DANGER
TO FISH IN THE RIVER.
>> Stephen: SEE, LOWTOXICITY, ZERO DANGER TO
FISH IN THE RIVER, WHICHSHOULD BE A RELIEF TO WEST
VIRGINIAIANS WHO HAVE NOWDEVELOPED ILLS.
BESIDES, I THINK WE ALL KNOWTHE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON
WHETHER HUMAN BEINGS NEEDWATER TO SURVIVE.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHEROPTIONS.
FOR INSTANCE WHAT ABOUTSALIVA.
I'M DRINKING IT RIGHT NOW.
YES, IT'S A LITTLE BLAND BUTI FIND, I FIND I JUST TAKE A
LITTLE COUNTRY TIME LEMONADE-- (LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I JUST PUT A PINCH BETWEEN
MY CHEEK AND GUMS AND I GOTZESTY REFRESHMENT WITHOUT
BEING A SLAVE TO BIG CATS.
WHAT IS THAT TASTE.
IT'S GOT 4 METHTYL CYCLOHEXANE METHANOL.
HMMMM, THAT'S WHAT MICKS ITCOUNTRY.
