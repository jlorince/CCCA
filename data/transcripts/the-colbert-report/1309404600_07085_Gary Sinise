HEY --

THANKS FOR COMING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

MAN!
YOU ARE A BIG STAR.
AND YOU ARE AN EMMY WINNER,
RIGHT?

>> Stephen: I GOT ONE OVER
THERE.
JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT
THERE.
>> WHAT IS THAT?
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT RIGHT
THERE?
AN HOURGLASS.
THE GRIM REAPER GAVE IT TO ME.
[LAUGHTER]
SIR, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU
ARE AN ADAD MY AWARD WINNING
ACTOR BEGUN DIRECTOR PRODUCER.
APOLLO 13, FOREST GUMP, OF MICE
AND MEN.
STEPPENWOLF IN CHICAGO.
YOU'VE GOT A NEW PROJECT CALLED
THE LIEUTENANT DAN BAND FOR THE
COMMON GOOD.
YOU HAVE A BAND NAMED AFTER YOUR
CHARACTER IN FOREST GUMP.
YOU'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD
PERFORMING FOR OUR TROOPS IN USO
SHOWS WHICH I ADMIRE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK MORE PEOPLE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK MORE ENTERTAINERS SHOULD
GO OUT THERE AND DO THAT.
>> I DO, TOO.
I THINK SO.
I HAVE A GREAT TIME DOING IT.
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN TO
GET OUT IN AND SUPPORT THE MEN
AND WOMEN SERVING THE COUNTRY.
THEY'VE WORKED VERY HARD.
THEY'VE BEEN VERY STRESSED.
WE'VE GOT TEN YEARS OF WAR NOW
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON A LOT OF
PEOPLE.
I GO OUT THERE AND TRY TO PLAY
FOR THEM AND DO WHAT I CAN.
A BUDDY OF MINE CAME TO ME A
WHILE AGO, FILMMAKER AND ASKED
ME IF HE COULD DOCUMENT WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING.
THERE'S A LOT OF WONDERFUL
THINGS IN THE FILM HE WAS ABLE
TO CAPTURE.
HE HAS PUT A GREAT FILM TOGETHER
I'M PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT.
>> Stephen: I HAVE ONLY ONE
PROBLEM WITH YOU, OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S THAT I WENT OVER AND DID
SHOWS IN IRAQ.
TWO YEARS AGO.
AND I HAVE BEEN OVER TO IRAQ
ONCE.
YOU'VE BEEN TO IRAQ FOUR TIMES
AND AFGHANISTAN TWICE.
AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A
PUSSY.
[LAUGHTER]
-- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK
OVER.
IS THAT -- DON'T YOU THINK MORE
ENTERTAINERS SHOULD GO OVER
THERE?
WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
THE AMOUNT OF GRATITUDE THOSE
PEOPLE GIVE YOU FOR GOING OVER
THERE.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING
EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD
PERFORMING FOR THOSE PEOPLE.
>> IT'S GREAT YOU DID THAT.
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU DID THAT.
>> Stephen: I'VE BEEN WAITING
THE ENTERTAIN INTERVIEW FOR YOU
TO SAY IT WAS A GREAT THING TO
DO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HI TO FISH THAT
LONG.
>> HR *T BAND DAN, NOT EVERYBODY
CAN DO A USO SHOW.
WHAT CAN PEOPLE BACK HERE DO TO
SUPPORT THE TROOPS OTHER THAN
ENLIST AND TAKE THEIR PLACE?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT WOULD BE NICE, RIGHT.
>> SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THAT,
YEAH IN THE SERVICE.
BUT THEY ARE WORKING HARD THERE.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN
DO.
I VISIT THE HOSPITALS ALL THE
TIME.
I SEND CARE PACKAGES.
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF
ORGANIZATIONS PUTTING CARE PACK
KWRAPBLGZ TOGETHER.
I HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED
OPERATION INTERNATIONAL
CHILDREN.
WE PUT SUPPLIES TOGETHER.
WE GIVE THEM TO THE TROOPS.
WE TAKE THEM OUT AND GIVE THEM
TO THE KIDS.
THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN DO
THAT ON LOIN.
I HAVE A FOUNDATION.
WE'RE SUPPORTING A LOT OF
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS.
YOU CAN GO TOM GARY SIN KWRAOES
FOUNDATION.ORG.
YOU CAN GO TO LT DAN BAND
MOVIE.COM AND WATCH IT ONLINE
BETWEEN JULY 4 AND 30th.
YOU CAN WATCH IT ONLINE AND ONE
OUT OF EVERY FOUR DOLLARS WILL
GO TO THE GARY SIN KWRAOES
FOUNDATION.
WE -- SIN ISE FOUNDATION.
>> LAST QUESTION, WHEN YOU WERE
IN IRAQ, HOW COLD WAS THE
TRAILER?
THAT YOU WERE?
BECAUSE THE COLDEST WINTER I
EVER SPENT WAS SUMMER IN
BAGHDAD.
BECAUSE THEY KEPT THE TRAILER
THAT WE WERE WORKING IN I SWEAR
47 DEGREES.
IT WAS 125 DEGREES OUTSIDE IN A
SANDSTORM AND I FELT LIKE IT WAS
ALMOST LIKE RUBBING IT IN THE
IRAQIS FACE THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS
MAY BE BAGHDAD HERE BUT IT'S
MINNESOTA UP IN THIS BUSINESS.
[LAUGHTER]
GARY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
