>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME MY
FRIENDS.
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, YOU
SOUND LIKE AN ANGEL CHIR
CALLING ME TO DESTINY.
YOU KNOW ME, I TRY TO KEEP A
LOW PROFILE.
ASK ANYBODY WHO SUBSCRIBES
TO THE STEPHEN COLBERT 24/7
LOW PROFILE WEB CAM.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR SOME REASON THE MEDIA IS
THE-- RECENTLY IT BECAUSE OF
PPPs RECENT PRESIDENTIAL P-P
P-P-POLL.
JIM?
>> ACCORDING TO A RECENT
POLL FIVE PERCENT OF SOUTH
CAROLINA PRIMARY VOTERS
WOULD PICK COLBERT MORE THAN
WOULD PICK JON HUNTSMAN.
>> COLBERT NARROWLY TRAILS
PERRY.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT IS
SHOOTING UP TO 5%.
>> COLBERT IS AHEAD OF JON
HUNTSMAN.
>> I WAS READING THAT
STEPHEN COLBERT WOULD DO
BETTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA
THAN JON HUNTSMAN.
>> Stephen: YES, I AM
OFFICIALLY BEATING JON
HUNTSMAN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU
CRECHE.
-- VERY MUCH.
PROVING WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS
SAID, IF VOTERS WANT A
DIFFERENT VERSION OF MITT
ROMNEY, THEY CAN ALWAYS JUST
WAIT A FEW DAYS AND IT WILL
BE MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW CLEARLY MY FELLOW SOUTH
CARLINIANS SEE ME AS THE
ONLY VIABLE MITT-TERNATIVE.
FOLKS, I TRIED TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN 2008.
AND FOLKS, I GOT HURT.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PUT
MYSELF THROUGH THAT AGAIN.
>> AH.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, CLEARLY IT'S A TOUGH
DECISION.
I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN MY
SHOES.
BUT I AM.
AND FOLKS, THEY'RE
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: COLBERT SUPERPAC
PAID FOR THESE BABIES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
FOLKS.
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
CANNOT COORDINATE WITH
SUPERPACS.
>> YOU CAN-- ARE YOU GIVING
ANY DIRECTION OR ADVICE TO
WINNING OUR FUTURE OF THE --
>> NONE.
>> ARE YOU AFFILIATED WITH
THEM AT ALL.
>> I'M NOT AFFILIATED WITH
THEM AT ALLMENT I DON'T TALK
WITH THEM AT ALL.
>> THERE'S A BRIGHT DIVISION
BETWEEN WHAT I DO AND WHAT
ANY SUPERPAC CAN DO.
>> SUPERPACS HAVE TO BE
ENTIRELY SEPARATE FRAY
CAMPAIGN AND A CANDIDATE.
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
COMMUNICATE WITH A SUPERPAC
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
>> Stephen: ROMNEY IS NOT
COMMUNICATING WITH THE
SUPERPAC IN ANY WAY, SHAPE
OR FORM.
THE EXACT SAME RELATIONSHIP
HE HAS WITH VOTERS.
INSTEAD, SUPERPACS ARE OFTEN
RUN BY PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE
CANDIDATE.
THE PRO ROMNEY SUPERPAC
RESTORE OUR FUTURE WAS
FOUNDED BY ROMNEY'S LAWYER,
WINNING OUR FUTURE THE NEWT
GINGRICH SUPERPAC IS RUN BY
A FORMER NEWT STAFFER.
AND THE RICK PERRY SUPERPAC
MAKE US GREAT AGAIN WAS
STARTED BY MIKE TOOMEY WHO
WAS PERRY'S CHIEF OF STAFF
AND CO-OWNS AN ISLAND WITH
DAVE CARNEY, PERRY'S CHIEF
STRATEGIST.
BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU SPEND
TIME ON AN ISLAND WITH
SOMEONE DOES NOT MEAN YOU
COORDINATE WITH THEM.
AFTER ALL, GILLIGAN NEVER
