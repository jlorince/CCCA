>> Stephen: BELL COME TO "THE
REPORT," EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ACADEMY
AWARD-WINNING DOCUMENTARIAN WHO
HAS WRITTEN A MEMOIR, "HERE
COMES TROUBLE," WHICH IS WHAT
HE'LL BE THINKING AS SOON AS I
STAND UP.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL MOORE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MICHAEL, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, GOOD TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOW YOU BEEN?
>> I'VE BEEN DOING GOOD.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PORTRAIT
BACK THERE?
>> WE'RE UNVEILING A NEW
PORTRAIT SOON.
NO, NO, NO, NO PUPPETS BACK
THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, MICHAEL, I'M EXCITED
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A NEW MEMOIR,
THE STORIES FROM MY LIFE, "HERE
COMES TROUBLE."
WELL, EXPLAIN TO ME ABOUT THIS.
PARENTS CAN READ THIS STORY,
STORIES FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD, AND
USE IT AS A CAUTIONARY TALE.
TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN DON'T
TURN INTO YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
2348 BECAUSE, MICHAEL, YOU'VE
GOT TO KNOW AT THIS POINT, IT IS
OVER.
LIBERALISM HAS LOST, AND YOU
STAND AS A WALKING,, BREATHING
CAUTIONARY TALE, A DECAYING DON
QUIXOTE STANDING AT HIS
WINDMILL.
WITH EVERY TURN OF THE SPAR, YOU
ARE DRIVEN DOWN INTO THE MUD.
SEND YOURSELF A LETTER WHILE THE
POST OFFICE IS STILL HERE,
MICHAEL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER.
>> I'LL RESPOND.
I'M AFRAID IT'S YOUR SIDE THAT'S
OVER.
YOU HAVE... YOUR... NOT YOU
PERSONALLY, BUT YOUR PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: OH, "YOUR PEOPLE."
THAT'S RACIST.
GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
YEAH, YEAH, YOU CAN'T TELL ANY
IRISH PEOPLE APART.
GO AHEAD.
>> I'M A BIGOT AGAINST PEOPLE
LIKE YOU THAT SUPPORT WALL
STREET AND CORPORATIONS AND...
>> THE JOB CREATORS.
YOU HATE JOB CREATORS.
GO AHEAD.
>> THE JOB ELIMINATORS IS WHAT
YOUR PEOPLE ARE.
AND, YES, I AM A BIGOT AGAINST
ALL OF YOU.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU BECOME
WHO YOU ARE?
WAS THERE A MOMENT IN YOUR
CHILDHOOD WHEN YOU SAW AN
INJUSTICE?
DID YOU BLOW THE LID OFF THE
LEMONADE STAND?
HE'S USING COUNTRY TIME POWDER.
>> I WAS... I WAS STANDING IN
LINE FOR MY GRADUATION, AND THE
ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL WAS GOING
DOWN THE LINE TO CHECK TO MAKE
SURE EACH OF THE BOYS HAD A TIE
ON, AND THE BOY IN FRONT OF ME
HAD A STRING TIE, AND HE YANKS
HIM OUT OF THE LINE AND SAYS,
YOU'RE NOT GOING THROUGH
GRADUATION, AND HE KICKED HIM
OUT, LIKE LITERALLY SHOVED HIM
OUT OF THE BUILDING BECAUSE HE
HAD THE WRONG TIE ON, AND I
STOOD THERE AND SAID NOTHING.
AND IT BOTHERED ME SO MUCH THAT
I REMAINED SILENT BECAUSE I
DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET KICKED OUT
OF MY GRADUATION, AND THE NEXT
DAY I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
AND THEN HIS MOTHER CALLED ME
AND TOLD ME THIS STORY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTERWARDS,
AND I JUST THOUGHT, WOW, THAT'S
THE LAST TIME I'M GOING TO BE
SILENT WHEN I SEE SOMETHING
GOING ON THAT'S WRONG, EVEN IF
IT'S A LITTLE THING LIKE, THAT
I'M GOING TO SPEAK UP, IT'S MY
RESPONSIBILITY AS A HUMAN BEING.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT SPEAKING
UP.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I WANT YOU
TO APPLAUD FOR HIM.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE
WRONG.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU SAY EARLY ON IN THIS BOOK
THAT SOME OF THE STORIES MIGHT
NOT ALL BE TRUE.
SO YOU ARE ADMITTING THAT YOU
ARE A LIAR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO, IT DOESN'T SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: NOT TRUE, RIGHT?
>> THE STORIES ARE TRUE, BUT
WHAT I SAY AT THE BEGINNING IS
THEY'RE FROM MEMORY, AND THEY'RE
MY MEMORY, AND THREE PEOPLE
COULD SEE THE SAME THING AND SEE
IT DIFFERENT WAYS.
I'M SURE YOUR MEMORY IS SUCH
THAT YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THE
2000 ELECTION AS GEORGE BUSH
WINNING IN A LANDSLIDE.
>> Stephen: I SEEM TO REMEMBER
HIM BEING SWORN IN.
>> YES, THAT PART IS TRUE.
>> Stephen: IT'S TRUE.
THANK YOU.
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> AND WE ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY
FOR THE EIGHT YEARS THAT WE HAD
TO SUFFER THROUGH THAT.
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS
PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: YOU SUPPORTED THIS
GUY, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
ARE YOU IN DESPAIR THAT YOU
SEE... THAT YOU HANDED OVER THE
LAST FLICKERING FLAME OF
LIBERALISM TO SOMEONE WHO WILL
GIVE CONGRESS MORE THAN THEY
COULD GET FROM A REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENT?
>> THAT LIST FLICKERING FLAME,
THAT MAN WON BY TEN MILLION MORE
VOTES THAN JOHN McCAIN.
THAT WAS A HUGE MARGIN, NOT 200
VOTES.
>> Stephen: HEY, IT AIN'T THE
SIZE OF THE BOAT.
IT'S HOW YOU DRIVE IT.
OKAY.
AN WE'RE IN ROCKY WATERS.
>> I THINK IN THE CASE OF BARACK
OBAMA, IT IS ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: LET'S SAY YOU WAVE
A MAGIC WAND AND BARACK OBAMA
CHANGED INSTANTLY OR YOU COULD
CHANGE THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
BE THIS YEAR?
WHO SHOULD THE DEMOCRATS RUN IF
IT WASN'T BARACK OBAMA?
>> IT SHOULD BE BARACK OBAMA.
>> LEST SAY MAGIC WAND.
>> THERE'S NO MAGIC WAND.
>> Stephen: IN MY STORY
THERE'S A MAGIC WAND.
SOME OF MY STORY IS NOT TRUE,
JUST LIKE YOUR BOOK.
OKAY.
IF THERE WAS MAGIC WAND, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND, WHY DON'T THE
DEMOCRATS... THE REPUBLICAN RUN
ACTORS ALL THE TIME AND THEY WIN
BECAUSE THEY'RE BELOVED FIGURES,
RONALD REAGAN, SCHWARZENEGGER,
TED THOMPSON FOR SENATE.
HOW COME THE DEMOCRATS DON'T RUN
TOM HANKS OR OPRAH.
>> Stephen: TOM HANKS?
DID YOU SEE "BOOZE UM BUDDIES"?
THE MAN WAS A FRANCE --
TRANSVESTITE.
MICHAEL MOORE, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US.
THE BOOK IS "HERE COMES
TROUBLE," AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE
IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
