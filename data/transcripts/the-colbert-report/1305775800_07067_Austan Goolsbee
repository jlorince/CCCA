>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ECONOMIC
ADVISOR FOR THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
I ASSUME HE'S HERE TO BEG ME FOR
A LOAN.
PLEASE WELCOME AUSTAN GOALSBURY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- AUSTAN GOOLSBEE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW I DON'T
NORMALLY SAY TO MY GUEST.
>> I DON'T LIKE HOW THIS IS
ALREADY BEGINNING.
OKAY, YES.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO LET
YOU GET IN A WORD IN EDGEWISE
BECAUSE I LOVE TO HEAR YOU
EXPLAIN HOW ON MONDAY WE HIT THE
MAGICAL DEADLY DEBT CEILING DATE
AND WE'RE ALL STILL HERE!
THE EARTH DIDN'T SWALLOW THE
UNITED STATES LIKE YOU
PREDICTED.
>> NO --
>> Stephen: IS YOUR BOOKIE MAN
DEAD?
>> IF HE THEY CUT OFF WATER TO
YOUR HOUSE.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A FEW
GALLONS IN THE TOILET THAT YOU
CAN DRINK IS NOT GOING TO SAVE
YOU.
YOU HAVE TO GET THE WATER
STARTED AGAIN.
>> Stephen: REMIND ME NOT TO
HAVE A DRINK AT YOUR HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WE HIT THE DEBT CEILING.
WE HAVE EMERGENCY MEASURES THAT
WE CAN RELY ON UNTIL THOSE
MEASURES RUN OUT.
WE'RE STRETCHING IT.
>> Stephen: AMERICA IS LIVING
ON HAMBURGER HELPER, IS WHAT YOU
ARE SAYING.
>> AT BEST.
IT'S WHATEVER IS IN THE PANTRY.
THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY SAYS
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE
TECHNICAL DEBT CEILING.
THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO
AROUND THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST
AND THEN THAT'S --
>> Stephen: LET ME JUST --
I'LL BITE ON YOUR HYPERLET CALL
CRISIS.
-- HYPERLET CALL CRISIS --
HYPOTHETICAL CRISIS.
WHAT -- SO -- OR PUT IN A
SIMPLER WAY SO WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENS?
I HEAR A LOT, I SAY, AUSTAN,
TREAT ME LIKE I'M AN IDIOT.
WHAT IS THE WORSE THAT THE
HAPPENS IF WE HIT THE DEBT
CEILING.
>> IF WE HIT THE DEBT CEILING
AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
DEFAULTED, IT WOULD DEFAULT ON
TREASURIES, THE INTEREST RATE
WOULD EXPLODE, BANKS WOULD
COLLAPSE OR THEY DEFAULT ON
SOCIAL SECURITY, SENIOR CITIZENS
AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE NOT
RECEIVING THEIR CHECKS.
WE DEFAULT ON THE MILITARY, WE
DON'T PAY THE MILITARY BILLS OR
WE DEFAULT ON MEDICARE.
ALL OF THESE ARE BAD.
WE DON'T WANT TO GET NEAR THIS.
THIS IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE WORST
CASE SCENARIO?
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER PRINT MORE
MONEY?
THAT'S ALWAYS THE DEMOCRATS
ANSWER, RIGHT?
TAX AND SPEND.
CUT THE BUDGET.
>> LET'S CUT THE BUDGET.
>> Stephen: CUT THE SPENDING.
>> I AGREE.
>> Stephen: NO NEW TAXES.
>> NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
>> Stephen: READ YOUR LIPS.
>> READ MY LIPS?
THE HIGH INCOME TAX RATES ARE
THE LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN IN SOME
60 YEARS.
>> Stephen: THANK GOD!
>> WE CANNOT AFFORD IN AN
ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'VE GOT BIG
DEFICITS, LONG-RUN FISCAL
CHALLENGES THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T
THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO KEEP RATE
AS THE THESE HISTORICALLYs.
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT TO CUT SPENDING, BOTH
SIDES AGREE.
AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT CUTTING OF $4
TRILLION OVER TEN YEARS IS
BASICALLY THE SAME ON THE TWO
SIDES.
IT'S JUST TOTALLY DIFFERENT HOW
WE GET THERE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF --
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A PAGE FROM AVERAGE AMERICANS
AND WALK AWAY FROM OUR DEBT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
AND JUST LIVE UNDER ASSUMED
NAMES LIKE WE JUST DUCT TAPED
FLORIDA UP AGAINST THE GULF
COAST.
[LAUGHTER]
WE TRY TO PASS OURSELVES OFF AS
BRAZIL IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU
MOVED OUT A LONG TIME AGO.
>> THAT WON'T WORK.
>> Stephen: WHAT WORKS?
>> LOOK, WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE
BUDGET.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> THE DEBT CEILING NOT THE
ISSUE.
THE ISSUE IS THE BUDGET.
>> Stephen: THE ISSUE IS THAT
YOU GUYS ARE TWO YEARS IN.
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T FIXED THE
ECONOMY?
YOU'VE HAD TWO YEARS.
TWO YEARS!
>> YOUR KILLING ME.
>> Stephen: I'M KILLING YOU.
9% UNEMPLOYMENT.
WHERE ARE THE JOBS?
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T FIXED IT
YET?
FIVE WORDS OR LESS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> DO NUMBERS COUNT AS WORDS?
>> Stephen: NO.
>> 2 HAD THE 1 MILLION -- 2.1
MILLION JOBS ADDED IN THE LAST
14 MONTHS.
IN THE LAST 14 MONTHS.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY JOBS?
>> 2.1 MILLION.
WAY DOWN HERE 1929 LEVELS.
>> Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU KEEP
DIGGING TO CHINA AND GET MORE
MONEY?
THAT'S WHAT WE MUST DO.
LET'S CUT SPENDING.
LET'S NOT.
LET'S RETURN TO TAX REVENUES
FROM HIGH INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE
MOST LIKE THE HISTORIC NORTH.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT GUYS LIKE ME.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZE YOUR
TALKING ABOUT GUYS RAISING
TAXES.
>> THEY ARE SAYING LET IT GO TO
WHAT THEY WERE UNDER BILL
CLINTON.
IT TAKES CUTS UNDER A BALANCED
PLAN.
DISCRETIONARY, ENTITLEMENTS,
REVENUE, SAVE INTEREST COSTS.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WORKING ON THE BUDGETARY
PROBLEMS?
>> A LONG TIME.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: HOW MANY YEARS?
>> IN THE ADMINISTRATION WE CAME
IN JANUARY OF 2009.
PREVIOUS TO THAT STUDYING IT AS
AN AM DECKIC FOR 14 YEARS.
>> Stephen: 16 YEARS NOW.
>> SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT IT FOR SIX MINUTES AND I
CAN BARELY FEEL MY TOES.
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
THE CHAIRMAN -- THE CHAIRMAN OF
THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC
ADVISORS.
