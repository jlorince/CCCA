BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND THE
INSTINCT.
FOLKS, WITH ALL OF THIS
HAPPENING THE NATIONAL NEWS
MEDIA IS DESCENDING ON IOWA
THIS WEEKEND WHICH CAN MEAN
ONLY ONE THING.
>> SARAH PALIN IS HEADING
BACK TO EYE WAP.
THE FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR
IS ANNOUNCING SHE'S TAKING
HER BUS TOUR TO THE STATE
FAIR THIS WEEK, JUST 30
MILES SOUTH FROM WHERE THE
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
DEBATE WILL BE HELD TONIGHT.
>> WELL, THAT'S A HAPPY
COINCIDENCE.
AFTER A BRIEF TWO-MONTH PIT
STOP SARAH PALIN IS BRINGING
HER BUS TOUR OF AMERICAN'S
HISTORIC PLACES TO THE
HISTORIC IOWA STATE FAIR
WHERE THOMAS EDISON INVENTED
THE FUNNEL CAKE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE
SAME-- THIS IS THE
SAME-- STOP IT.
THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF
COINCIDENCE THAT TOOK HER
BUS TOUR TO NEW HAMPSHIRE
THE DAY MITT ROMNEY DECLARED
HIS CANDIDACY.
APPARENTLY SARAH PALIN'S
VERSION OF THE BAT SIGNAL IS
ANYONE ELSE'S SPOTLIGHT.
SO FOLKS, DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF DURING TONIGHT'S DEBATE
YOU SEE THIS.
NOW OF COURSE AS A
CONSERVATIVE I LOVE SARAH
PALIN BUT FRANKLY SHE IS
STEALING FOCUS AWAY FROM THE
REAL STORY.
>> THE FIRST THING THE
COLBERT SUPERPAC HAS DONE IS
CREATE AN AD FOR RICK PERRY.
>> AMERICANS FOR A BETTER
TOMORROW TOMORROW HAS
RELEASED ITS FIRST AD.
>> A ONE MINUTE CAMPAIGN AD
THAT IS NOW AIRING ACROSS
IOWA.
>> HE IS ENDORSING RICK
PERRY.
>> SUPPORTING RICK PERRY FOR
PRESIDENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
COLBERT SUPERPAC, NOT
AFFILIATED WITH THIS SHOW,
HAS MADE THEIR FIRST AD AND
HAS CHANGED THE GAME IN IOWA,
FOLKS.
I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS
RICK PERRY IS THE GUY.
THE PROBLEM IS ACCORDING TO
THE TENACIOUS KEN VOGEL AT
"POLITICO" THERE ARE SIX
OTHER SUPERPACS ALREADY
SWIPING AT ONE ANOTHER TO BE
THE PERRY SUPERPAC AND RAKE
IN CASH FROM PERRY'S
BILLIONAIRE BUDDY.
SO LAST NIGHT WE LAUNCHED
OUR AIR POWER TO PROVE THAT
WE'RE 9 ONLY SUPERPAC RICK
PERRY REALLY NEEDS.
JIM?
>> A STORM IS GATHERING OVER
IOWA.
A MONEY STORM.
OUT OF STATE GROUPS LIKE
GROW PACK AND JOBS FOR IOWA
PAC ARE FLOODING THE IOWA
AIRWAVES TELLING YOU TO VOTE
RICK PERRY AT THE AMES STRAW
POLL.
WE THEY THINK THEY CAN BUY
YOUR VOTE WITH THEIR
UNLIMITED SUPERPAC MONEY.
>> BUT AMERICANS FOR A
BETTER TOMORROW TOMORROW ASK
WHAT ABOUT OUR UNLIMITED
SUPERPAC MONEY.
WE WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR RICK
PERRY TOO.
BUT NOT THEIR RICK PERRY,
OUR RICK PERRY.
ON AUGUST 13th WRITE IN RICK
PERRY, THAT'S PERRY WITH AN
AS Q AS FOR AMERICA, WITH AN
"A" FOR IOWA,-- THAT'S
RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

BEAUTIFUL DAY.

(LAUGHTER)
>> AND THIS EVENING AT 1700
HOURS WE STRUCK AGAIN WITH
OUR SECOND AD IN THE GREATER
DES MOINES METROPOLITAN
AREA.

>> IOWA, A LAND OF GOOD
PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE UP THEIR
OWN MINDS.
BUT OUTSIDE GROUPS LIKE JOBS
FOR IOWA SUPERPAC ARE TRYING
TO PANDER TO IOWANS WITH PRO
PERRY ADS FEATURING CHEAP
CORNOGRAPHY.
