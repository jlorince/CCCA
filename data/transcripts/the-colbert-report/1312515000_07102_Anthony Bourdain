MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A CELEBRITY
CHEF WHO HOSTS "NO RESERVATIONS"
ON THE TRAVEL CHANNEL.
IF I DON'T LIKE HIM, I'LL SEND
HIM BACK.
PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY BOURDAIN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MR. BOURDAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
NOW, AS I SAID YOU'RE, A
CELEBRITY CHEF.
PEOPLE KNOW YOU ARE.
BUT FOR THE UNINITIATED, YOU ARE
A CHEF AT LARGE, YOU'RE AN
AUTHOR, YOU'RE HOST OF THE
TRAVEL CHANNEL'S NO RESERVATIONS
CURRENTLY IN ITS SEVENTH SEASON.
THIS SEASON YOU'RE GOING OFF THE
GRID.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE.
PLACES LIKE HAITI AND CUBA.
WHY NOT GO PLACES THAT HAVE
FOOD?
[LAUGHTER]
>> UM...
>> Stephen: THEY GOT RICE AND
BEANS IN CUBA, RIGHT?
>> TRUE.
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO ADMIT, TO
SOME EXTENT THIS LAST SEASON
WE'VE BEEN MOVING NOT TO JUST
WHAT PEOPLE ARE EATING BUT WHAT
THEY'RE NOT EATING.
>> Stephen: I GOT TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND FOOD.
OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T.
I'M NOT A FOODIE, BUT I DO
UNDERSTAND ANGER.
>> RIGHT.
>> AND ONE OF THE THINGS I
APPRECIATE ABOUT YOUR SHOW IS
THAT... AND YOUR STYLE, YOU HAVE
STYLE, MATTHEW BOURDAIN, BUT YOU
OFTEN SEEM ANGRY AT THE FOOD
THAT IS BEING GIVEN TO YOU.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: EVEN IF YOU LIKE
IT, YOU MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE
ANGRY AT THE FOOD.
WHY THE ANGER IN RELATION THE
FOOD?
DOESN'T FOOD BRING US PLEASURE?
>> IT SHOULD.
IN A PERFECT WORLD I SHOULD BE
HAPPY ALL THE TIME AND IT'S ALL
ABOUT LOVE, BUT I ASK MYSELF
THIS ALL THE TIME.
I SHOULD BE... MAYBE IT'S THAT I
COOKED FOR 28 YEARS.
FROM A PROFESSIONAL POINT OF
VIEW, I CAN'T BYPASS A CHILIS OR
AN OLIVE GARDEN AND NOT BOIL
WITH RAGE.
>> Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
MAKES ME MAD ABOUT OLIVE GARDEN,
I APPRECIATE IT.
I GET THAT.
WHAT MAKES ME MAD, I GO TO THE
OLIVE GARDEN, THEY SAY,
UNLIMITED BREAD STICKS, BUT IF I
BACK MY CAR UP AND SAY FILL THE
TRUNK, THEY SAY, "NO WAY."
IT'S A LIE.
NOT UNLIMITED.
THERE ARE LIMITS.
BUT WHY EVEN LEAVE AMERICA TO
GET EXOTIC FARE?
I CAN GO TO MY LOCAL FOOD MART
AND GET A PANDA EXPRESS AND
CHIPOTLE AND TACO BELL AND OTHER
THINGS.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, I CAN TRAVEL THE WORLD
IN MY JAZZY.
>> YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ASK ALL THE
TIME, WHAT'S NOSE EXOTIC OR
UNUSUAL OR GROTESQUE FOOD YOU'VE
EVER EATEN, AND I STILL MAINTAIN
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BEAT FOR
SHEER GROTESQUENESS AND
BIZARRENESS A CINNABUN.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: REALLY?
REALLY?
IS IT THAT THEY'RE LARGER THAN
YOUR FACE?
>> THAT'S ONE WORRISOME ASPECT.
>> Stephen: BUT ISN'T THE FACT
THAT OUR PORTIONS ARE SO LARGE
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AMERICANS
HAVE THE BEST FOOD?
WE CERTAINLY... WE SEEM TO EAT
THE MOST FOOD.
WE'RE A LARGE PEOPLE.
>> THAT CONCERNS ME ALSO.
AS A PATRIOT, I'M CONCERNED BY
THE BALLOONING OF AMERICA.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU ONCE ATE
SOMETHING THAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT.
IT'S CALLED ORTHALON.
>> YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
>> Stephen: EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE
WHAT THAT IS AND WHAT IT IS.
>> IT'S A TINY LITTLE BIRD.
>> A NATURE BIRD.
>> SOME SAY.
>> Stephen: SOME SAY.
ENDANGERED.
>> SOME SAY ENDANGERED.
IT'S A TINY LITTLE BIRD THAT'S
CAPTURED, FATTENED, PLUCKED.
>> Stephen: BLINDED?
>> NO, THEY DON'T BLIND IT.
THEY JUST GIVE IT A WHIFF OF
SOMETHING AND THEY KEEL OVER
DEAD.
THEY ROAST THEM.
YOU PICK THEM UP.
IT'S A CEREMONIAL ASPECT.
YOU PUT BASICALLY HOOD OVER YOUR
HEAD, A SHROUD, AND YOU STICK IT
IN YOUR MOUTH AND CRUNCH DOWN
INTO THE BODY, BONES, GUTS AND
ALL.
IT'S A HOT RUSH OF FAT, GUTSZ,
BONES, BLOOD AND MEAT AND IT'S
REALLY DELICIOUS.
IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST, MOST
EXTRAORDINARY DINING EXPERIENCES
YOU CAN HAVE.
>> Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND
YOU WEAR THE HOOD OVER YOUR HEAD
TO HIDE FROM GOD.
>> MORE PEOPLE SHOULD DO THIS.
>> Stephen: ANTHONY BOURDAIN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.
ANTHONY BOURDAIN, "NO
RESERVATIONS" AIRS MONDAY NIGHT
AT 9:00 ON THE TRAVEL CHANNEL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
