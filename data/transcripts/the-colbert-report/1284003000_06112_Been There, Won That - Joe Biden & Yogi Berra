FIRECRACKER.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, FOLKS,
TONIGHT WE CELEBRATE THE BRAVE
MEN AND WOMEN WHO WON THE IRAQ
WAR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY.
NOW LET'S SAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEBATE THIS
WAR.
IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS.
AT THIS POINT WHO CAN REMEMBER
WHO INVADED WHO?
MIGHT AS WELL DEBATE THE CAUSES
OF WORLD WAR I.
DAMN YOU, WOODROW WILSON, YOU
TRIGGER-HAPPY MAD MAN.
NO, WE JUST HONOR THE COURAGE OF
THOSE DOUGH BOYS WHO FOUGHT IN
THE TRENCHES IN 1918.
WE SALUTE YOU, LARRY KING.
[LAUGHTER]
SO TONIGHT, FOLKS, TONIGHT IS
FOR THE TROOPS.
AND WE'VE GOT A LIVE SATELLITE
FEED TO THE NON-COMBAT TROOPS IN
IRAQ AT CAMP ANACONDA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW... YEAH.
NOW, REMEMBER, NOW REMEMBER,
IRAQ TROOPERS, YOU'RE NOT
FIGHTING A WAR ANYMORE.
YOU'RE NON-COMBATING PEACE.
WE ALSO HAVE A LIVE SATELLITE
FEED TO THE TROOPS IN
AFGHANISTAN.
HELLO, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, NOW, JUST TO BE CLEAR,
THOSE ARE COMBAT TROOPS.
AGAIN, THE ONES IN IRAQ ARE
NON-COMBAT TROOPS.
COMBAT, NON-COMBAT.
AND IF YOU CAN TELL THE
DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
[LAUGHTER]
AND MY STUDIO AUDIENCE IS ALL
MILITARY PERSONNEL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO... SO... YES.
SO FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME,
TROOPS ARE EMBEDDED WITH A
JOURNALIST.
I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU FOLKS
WON'T GIVE AWAY MY POSITION.
IT'S MISSIONARY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND JUST WHAT WERE THESE BRAVE
MEN AND WOMEN FIGHTING FOR?
A LITTLE SOMETHING I CALL
AMERICA.
AND ALL THOSE THINGS AMERICA
OFFERS THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED
THAT THEY DID WITHOUT, LIKE
GREEN GRASS.
YOU SEE EVIDENTLY IRAQ HAS HAD A
LAWN-WATERING BAN FOR ABOUT
5,000 YEARS.
SO TONIGHT WE'VE LAID REAL LIVE
GRASS IN THE AUDIENCE FOR YOU TO
SINK YOUR TOOTSIES IN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IN BAGHDAD... IN BAGHDAD THE
ONLY WAY YOU CAN FEEL SOMETHING
THAT PLUSH AND TICKLY WAS TO RUN
YOUR TOES THROUGH SADDAM'S
MUSTACHE.
[LAUGHTER]
HE WILL BE MISSED.
AND ALL YOU CAN GET OVER THERE
WAS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER, WHICH,
AND I WANT TO PUT THIS
DELICATELY, TASTES LIKE HORSE
URINE.
WELL, THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY FAIR
TO HORSE YOU RIB.
EVENTUALLY HORSE URINE WILL GET
YOU BUZZED.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO AND I
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
SO BRICK OUT THE BEER, PRETTY
GIRLS.
COME ON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND WE ARE SERVING... WE ARE
SERVING YOU REAL AMERICAN FOOD.
WE'VE EVEN GOT A HOT DOG CART.
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL TAKE A DOG.
HEY, HEY, HOT DOG GUY, HOT DOG
GUY.
>> TO YOU IT'S MR. VICE
PRESIDENT HOT DOG GUY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HELP YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: MR. BIDEN, SORRY.
I DIDN'T EXPECT THE VPTS TO
SERVE HOT DOGS.
>> READ YOUR CONSTITUTION.
I HAVE TWO CONSTITUTIONAL
DUTIES.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST BREAKING TIES IN THE
SENATE.
>> NO, THE OTHER ONE IS GIVING
HOT DOGS TO RETURNING TROOPS.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, THERE
IS ONE THING THAT YOU MISSED
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, A REAL
TOILET.
INSTEAD OF 130-DEGREE PORT
APOTTY, OR WHAT I CALL THE FIELD
URINAL.
THAT'S WHY FOR YOU TONIGHT I
HAVE INSTALLED BACK STAGE THE
GREATEST TOILET ON PLANET EARTH.
JIMMY.
>> IT'S THE TOTO S400 ULTRA MAX
2 WITH SOFT HEATED SEAT, RATHER
FRONT OSCILLATING COMFORT
CLEANSE NOZZLE, WARM AIR DRIER,
DOUBLE CYCLONE FLUSHING SYSTEM
AND AUTOMATIC CATALYTIC AIR PURE
FIRE.
THE TOTO WASHLET.
YOU'LL FEEL LIKE AN ANGEL FLEW
UP YOUR BUTT.
>> YOU DESERVE IT.
YOU RISKED YOUR ASSES FOR US, SO
YOUR ASSES DESERVE THE BEST.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND TONIGHT... OUR FIRST LUCKY
G.I. JOHN IS...
[DRUM ROLL]
CAPTAIN SEAN TABANKIN.
COME ON DOWN.
[PRICE IS RIGHT THEME MUSIC
PLAYING]
COME ON.
GET IN THERE, SOLDIER.
GET IN THERE AND DO YOUR DUTY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, IT'S EASY TO SAY THE IRAQ
WAR IS OVER, BUT ACTUALLY ENDING
IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, 50,000 TROOPS
STILL IN IRAQ?
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT'S FUNNY.
AND THE EXACT END OF THE IRAQ
WAR BRICKS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
"OVER AND OUT."
NOW, I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE
WAR IS OVER, AND I ACCEPT THAT.
BUT FOR SOME REASON A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF PEOPLE REFUSE TO
BELIEVE IT.
FOR INSTANCE, FOR INSTANCE, THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS HAS TOLD ITS
REPORTERS THAT COMBAT IN IRAQ IS
NOT OVER AND WE SHOULD NOT
UNEQUIVOCALLY REPEAT SUGGESTIONS
THAT IT IS.
NOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE
MEDIA WOULD QUESTION THE END OF
THIS WAR.
I'M CONFUSED.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED
DARK AT TIMES, AGAINST ALL
CHALLENGES WE'VE CLEARLY WON
THIS WAR AND IT IS OVER.
AGAIN.
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, IT HAS
BEEN OVER, OVER AND OVER.
FIRST, THE FIRST TIME IT WAS
OVER WAS WHEN THE STATUE OF
SADDAM GOT PULLED DOWN.
THEN IT WAS OVER WHEN PRESIDENT
BUSH LANDED ON THE AIRCRAFT
CARRIER.
COMMANDERS EVEN STARTED HANDING
OUT PATCHES LIKE THIS ONE THAT
SAID, "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"
WITH THE TASTEFUL IMAGES OF
BAGHDAD AND BASRA ON FIRE.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN IT WAS OVER WHEN WE PULLED
SADDAM OUT OF HIS FIGHTER HOLE,
ONLY TO BE OVER AGAIN IN 2005
WHEN IRAQIS PROUDLY DISPLAYED
THEIR PURPLE FINGERS, PROVING
THEY HAD VOTED, OR THAT THEY HAD
JUST DONE SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO
THE GRIMACE.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS, EVERY TIME IT'S
BEEN OVER, THEY'VE ASKED YOU
TROOPS TO WIN IT AGAIN.
AND EVERY TIME YOU'VE DONE IT.
IN FACT, UNIVERSITY WON THIS WAR
SO MANY TIME, THAT IF THERE WAS
AN AWARD FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES
YOU'VE WON, YOU'D WIN THAT, TOO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE, MAYBE THEY ASKED YOU TO
WIN THIS WAR TOO MANY TIMES.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THE STORY OF
THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF?
BY THE WAY, WOLF BLITZER, STAY
AWAY FROM THAT BOY.
THIS MIGHT... THIS MIGHT JUST BE
THE WAR THAT CRIED OVER.
NOW, I REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT
THE WAR HAS ENDED, BUT THE FACT
IS WE STILL HAVE 50,000 TROOPS
IN HARM'S WAY.
SO WHEN CAN WE REALLY SAY IT'S
OVER?
FOR THE ANSWER, WE FEED NOW TURN
TO THE COLBERT REPORT'S CONFLICT
ANALYST.
PLEASE WELCOME HALL OF FAMER AND
PROUD VETERAN OF THE D-DAY
LANDING, MR. YOGI BERRA.
YOGI!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, YOGI, THANK YOU.
YOGI, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
HELP ME OUT, YOGI.
IS THE IRAQ WAR OVER?
>> STEPHEN, IT AIN'T OVER TILL
IT'S OVER.
>> STEPH
