THAT FACE
( LAUGHTER )
SPEAKING OF ( BLEEP ) GRINS,
COLBERT'S SUPERPAC, THANKS TO
THE SUPREME COURT'S CITIZENSES
UNITED RULING, SUPERPACS CAN
TAKE UNLIMBED DONATIONS AS LONG
AS HAY DON'T COORDINATE WITH
CAMPAIGNS, AND THEY REVEAL THEIR
DONORS, AS I HAVE WITH MY CRAWL
OF HEROES DOWN HERE.
( LAUGHTER )
AND I HAVE BEEN MOVED BY THE
DIVERSITY OF THE DONORS, FOLKS.
SCOTTISH AMERICANS, LIKE IRON
BALLS MCGINTY.
INDIAN AMERICANS LIKE M'BALZ ES
HARI.
AND GREEK MEMBERS OF THE COLBERTíMu|
NATION LIKE LOVEPORN
COCKONOPOLIS.
AND OF COURSE, A HEARTY THANK
YOU TO DONOR POOP GIGGLE, WHO
CLEARLY HAILS FROM THE NATION OF
KINDERGARTENSTAN.
SO HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GIVEN?
LET'S JUST SAY WE'RE INTO
NUMBERS I WOULDN'T WANT TO SERVE
IN A FEDERAL PRISON.
SO HERE IS A HEARTFELT TOAST TO
BEING THE KING OF PACS.
I JUST FEEL BAD FOR THE PREVIOUS
KING, TRANSLUCENT AMERICAN, KARL
ROVE, WHOSE PAC AMERICAN
CROSSROADS MUST LOOK PRETTY
PATHETIC RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
JIMMY, SHOW ME HOW KARL IS DOINGJ's4 6CJ
WHILE I UNSUSPECTINGLY FILL MY
FOOT AND MOUTH WITH CHAMPAGNE.
>> LAST YEAR, AMERICAN
CROSSROADS WAS COMMITTED TO
RAISING $120 MILLION BUT THEY
HAVE A NEW TARGET-- $240 MILLION
MILLION.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen:  OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, MY GOD.
( LAUGHTER )
SORRY, THAT WAS A SPIT-TAKE
FLASH BACK.
HOW DOES KARL DO IT?
I'D ASK HIM BUT, YOU KNOW, KARL
IS SHY.
HE DOESN'T DO TELEVISION, WHERE
THE RARE EXCEPTION OF EVERY SHOW
ON FOX NEWS
( LAUGHTER )
SO ONCE AGAIN, FOR THE SCOOP, I
TURN TO THE CLOSEST THING TO
KARL ROVE, A PAIR OF GLASSES ON
A HAM LOAF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ñ
HAM LOAF, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
NOW, HOW DID YOU RAISE ALL THAT
MONEY?
( LAUGHTER )
NOTHING, NOTHING.
MAN, HE-- HE IS TOUGH.
BUT LUCKILY, HE IS ALSO TENDER.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU SEE, FOLKES, I'M IRISH, AND
MY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU
EAT A HAM IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR
RIVAL'S HEAD, YOU GAIN ALL THEIR
KNOWLEDGE.
( LAUGHTER )
AND ALL THEIR SODIUM, TOO.
HERE GOES.
MMM.
AAAHHHH!gw
I AM KARL ROVE'S MEMORIES.
HIS HOUSE HAS A LOT OF
FULL-LENGTH MIRRORS, AND HIS
BATH ROBE HAS NO SASH.
NO!
NO!
OH!
OH!
OKAY, OKAY.
NOW I KNOW, AMERICAN CROSSROADS
EVIDENTLY WAS FORMED IN MARCH OF
2010.
AT THE TIME, THEY PROMISED "WE
HAVE CREATED AN ORGANIZATION
THAT WILL BE HIGHLY TRANSPARENT,
AND WITH THAT TRANSPARENCY,
DURING THE ENTIRE MONTH OF MAY
2010, AMERICAN CROSSROADS RAISED
EXACTLY $200.
( LAUGHTER )
EVIDENTLY, AMERICAN CROSSROADS
HAD PASSED GO.
( LAUGHTER )
SO IN JUNE, ROVE CREATED A
SISTER GROUP CALLED CROSSROADS
G.P.S., BUT UNLIKE YOUR CAR'S
G.P.S., THIS ONE ONLY SAYS.
>> TURN RIGHT, TURN RIGHT, TURN
FURTHER RIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  YOU SEE, YOU SEE,
CROSSROADS G.P.S. ISN'T A PACK.
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED A 501-C-4,
WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE DONOR
DISCLOSURE.
IT'S LIKE A SECRET SANTA.
IF SANTA WANTED TO WEAKEN
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, AND
WHILE AMERICAN CROSSROADS RAISED
ONLY $200 IN MAY, IN JUNE OF
THAT YEAR, CROSSROADS
G.P.S. BROUGHT IN $5.1 MILLION.
THAT'S AN INCREASE OF 2,550,000
2,550,000%.
( LAUGHTER )
THOSE ARE NUMBERS USUALLY SEEN
ONLY IN E-MAILS FOR BONER PILLS
( LAUGHTER )
CLEARLY, SHE'S C-4s HAVE
CREATED AN UNPRECEDENTED,
UNACCOUNTABLE, UNTRACEABLE CASH
TSUNAMI THAT WILL INFECT EVERY
CORNER OF THE NEXT ELECTION.
AND I FEEL LIKE AN
