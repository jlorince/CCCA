>> WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
EVERYBODY.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ED WILLEES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AN GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
AND MORE THAN THAT, LADIES AN GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR FEELING AT ME.
(LAUGHTER) NATION, WE ARE LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS AWAY FROM PICKING OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
AND AT THIS POINT, IT'S ANYBODY'S ELECTION.
>> LUCKY DUCKY.
>> OH, I'M SORRY, NOT ANYBODY'S, I'M SORRY,
HERRMANN, EITHER OBAMA OR ROMNEY'S ELECTION.
BECAUSE THE LATEST GALLOP POLL HAS THEM SEPARATED BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT.
IN 2004 WE HAD AN EQUAL-- EQUALLY CLOSE RACE BETWEEN BUSH AND KERRY.
THAT YEAR BUSH WON BECAUSE 11 STATES HAD ANTI-MARRIAGE BALLOT INITIATIVES THAT
DROVE CONSERVATIVES TO THE POLLS.
KUZ NOTHING GETS VALUE VOTERS TO YANK THE LEVER LIKE THE THOUGHT OF TWO GUYS
YANKING EACH OTHER'S LEVERS.
WELL-- FOLKS, THIS YEAR -- THIS YEAR THERE IS ONE HOT-BUTTON ISSUE THAT COULD GIVE OBAMA THE EDGE.
>> THE LEGALLIZATION OF MARIJUANA ONCE UNHEARD OF IN MOST EVERY POLITICAL CORNER
IS NOW PRETTY MUCH MAINSTREAM.
AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT CAN WIN ELECTIONS.
>> 50% OF AMERICANS NOW SAY THEY FAVOR LEGALLIZATION OF MARIJUANA WHICH IS I BELIEVE
A RECORD HIGH.
>> Stephen: YES, MARIJUANA SUPPORT IS AT A RECORD HIGH JUST LIKE IT'S SUPPORTERS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW CRUCIAL, CRUCIAL SWING STATES INCLUDING COLORADO,
OHIO AND MICHIGAN WILL ALL HAVE POT LEGALLIZATION INITIATIVES ON THE BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER.
AND DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING THAT IT WILL BOOST TURNOUT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE.
YES.
BECAUSE FOLKS, THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GRASS-ROOTS CAMPAIGN.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, FOLKS, THESE PRO POT INITIATIVES, IF THEY MAKE IT ON TO THE BALLOT I
SAY ROMNEY IS DOOMED.
BECAUSE WE CALL KNOW POT SMOKERS ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED,
ORGANIZED, AND PUNCTUAL.
THERE IS NOTHING THEY WOULD LOVE MORE THAN GETTING OFF THE COUCH, PUTTING ON PANTS
AND GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL GYMS PACKED WITH JUDGEMENTAL OLD PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) I SAY FOLKS, ROMNEY'S ONLY HOPE IS THAT ON NOVEMBER 6th,
DISCOVERY RUNS A PLANET EARTH MARATHON.
[BLEEP] DID YOU SEE THAT
