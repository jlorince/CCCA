>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE EDITOR
OF THE DO-IT-YOURSELF QUARTERLY
"MAKE" MAGAZINE, WHICH I BELIEVE
HE PRINTED IN HIS BASEMENT.
PLEASE WELCOME MARK
FRAUENFELDER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
HEY, MARK, WELCOME BACK.
>> HOW DO YOU DO?
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
NOW, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A
LITTLE WHILE.
LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU
DIDN'T HAVE A BOOK.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> YOU HAVE A BOOK NOW.
THE BOOK IS CALLED MADE BY HAND,
SEARCHING FOR MEANING IN THE
THROW-AWAY WORLD.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BITE.
WHAT'S A "THROW-AWAY WORLD."
>> A THROW-AWAY WORLD IS WHERE
WE GET RID OF THINGS THAT WE
DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO GET
RID OF.
AND ACTUALLY IF YOU TAKE TIME TO
MAKE YOUR OWN THINGS THAT HAVE
LASTING VALUE, YOU CAN FIND THAT
THE THINGS THAT YOU MAKE HAVE A
LOT MORE MEANING IN THEM.
>> STEPHEN: WHY CAN'T YOU FIND
MEANING IN A THROW-AWAY WORLD?
I HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING
MEANING IN A THROW-AWAY WORLD.
I'M THE ONE WHO THROWS AWAY.
I'M THE MASTER OF THE THROW-AWAY
WORLD.
I CREATE THE ENTIRE WORLD OF
THROW AWAY BY THROWING AWAY.
>> WELL, FOR EXAMPLE...
>> STEPHEN: YOU ACCEPT THAT I
WON THAT ARGUMENT?
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU.
>> FOR EXAMPLE, A TREE BRANCH
FELL OUT OF MY TREE IN A STORM
RECENTLY, AND SO I TOOK THAT
BRANCH AND CARVED WOODEN COOKING
IMPLEMENTS OUT OF IT, SPOONS AND
SPATULAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
INSTEAD OF THROWING THAT BRANCH
AWAY, I HAD THESE COOL
IMPLEMENTS.
EVERY TIME I USE THEM NOW, I
THINK, THIS IS REALLY FUN USING
SOMETHING THAT I MADE RATHER
THAN PURCHASING THEM.
THEY HAVE MEANING FOR ME.
AND I GIVE THE SPOONS AWAY AS
GIFTS AND STUFF AND IT'S A LOT
OF FUN TO SIT THERE AND...
>> STEPHEN: ARE YOU AND ELF?
[LAUGHTER]
IS THERE ANY CHANCE?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: YOU'RE NOT AN ELF.
I MEAN LIKE STRONG TOLKEIN ELF,
NOT ELF COOKIE TREE ELF.
IF I MAKE SOMETHING OR IF I GET
SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE HAS MADE
BY HAND, THEN THAT THING IS
UNIQUE AND IT IS IMBUED WITH THE
SPIRIT OF THE PERSON WHO MADE
IT.
I WON'T BE ABLE TO THROW IT AWAY
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LIKE
THROWING THAT PERSON AWAY.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THEIR SOUL
GOES IN, IN SOME WAY TO THAT
OBJECT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THAT'S WHY I BUY THINGS FROM
CHINA BECAUSE AS A COMMUNIST
COUNTRY, I THINK TECHNICALLY
THEY HAVE NO SOUL.
I THINK THEY GIVE THEM TO THE
STATE BEFORE THEY MAKE THE
PRODUCT FOR THEM AND THEY GET
THEM WHEN THEY GO HOME AT THE
END OF THE DAY.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I LIKE TO
MASS PRODUCE BECAUSE I'M NOT
AFRAID TO THROW IT AWAY.
>> WELL, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU ACTUALLY TRY THE MAKE YOUR
OWN THINGS, I RAISED MY OWN
CHICKENS AND GOT MY OWN EGGS
AND...
>> STEPHEN: YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE
CHICKENS.
>> NO, BUT I MADE THE CHICKEN
COOP.
>> STEPHEN: YOU MADE THE CHICKEN
COOP.
>> WITH AN AUTOMATIC CHICKEN
DOOR THAT OPENED AND CLOSED SO
THE CHICKENS COULD COME OUT IN
THE MORNING.
>> STEPHEN: DO THE CHICKENS HAVE
LITTLE REMOTES?
>> NO, IT'S SET ON A TIMER.
IT'S SET ON A TIMERREN
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT.
>> I BECAME A BEEKEEPER.
I STARTED HARVESTING HONEY.
IT'S A REALLY FUN ACTIVITY MY
KIDS AND I COLLECT THE HONEYCOMB
AND WE MAKE HONEY AND...
>> STEPHEN: IN THE BOOK, AM I
BEING TOLD HOW TO DO... CAN YOU
TEACH ME TO MAKE THINGS IN YOUR
BOOK?
>> I DON'T SAY EXACTLY HOW THE
MAKE THINGS.
I TALK ABOUT MY SPECIOUS OF
BECOMING A DO-IT-YOURSELFER AND
FINDING KIND OF HOW IT CHANGED
MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER BECAUSE
IT CONNECTED ME WITH MY KIDS AND
IT MADE ME MORE ENGAGED IN KIND
OF APPRECIATIVE AND OBSERVANT OF
EVERYTHING AROUND ME.
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE HERE.
>> WE HAVE A FEW THINGS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THIS RIGHT
HERE?
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MY
FRIENDS TODD AND MIKE MADE.
IT'S A WIRELESS DEVICE THAT IS
MONITORING EVERYTHING THAT GOES
ON ON TWITTER RIGHT NOW, AND
THERE ARE CERTAIN KEY WORDS
PROGRAMED IN HERE.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN "COLBERT"
IS MENTIONED OR "FREEDOM" OR
"U.S.A." OR "LIBERTY."
>> STEPHEN: THIS IS REGISTERING
WHEN SOMEONE IS USING MY NAME OR
FREEDOM OR COLBERT RIGHT NOW.
SOMEONE JUST DID IT.
>> IT'S LIKE AN ALL-KNOWING ORB.
>> STEPHEN: SO I CAN LOOK AT
THIS AND SEE HOW POPULAR I AM.
>> EXACTLY.
>> STEPHEN: I WOULDN'T WASTE MY
LIFE LOOKING AT THAT.
>> THIS IS A COOL DEVICE, AN
EXTREME MAKER, SOMEONE THAT
MAKES SOMETHING YOU CAN'T REALLY
BUY.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THIS?
>> JUST PUSH THIS SWITCH TOWARDS
ME.
>> STEPHEN: TOWARDS YOU?
THIS TOGGLE TOWARDS YOU?
>> YEAH.
GO AHEAD AND TRY IT AGAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: WHAT DOES THIS
MACHINE DO?
>> IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING, IT'S
CALLED THE MOST USELESS MACHINE.
ITS ONLY FUNCTION IS TO TURN
ITSELF OFF.
>> STEPHEN: I TELL YOU WHAT IT
DOES, MARK, IT BREAKS MY HEART.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, MARK, I SEE YOU ALSO MADE
YOUR OWN GUITAR OVER THERE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I MADE A GUITAR OUT OF A CIGAR
BOX.
AND AN AMPLIFIER OUT OF A CIGAR
BOX, AS WELL.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY
FUN.
I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN GOOD AT
PLAYING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.
SO THIS IS A THREE-STRINGED
INSTRUMENT.
IT'S EASIER TO PLAY, AND IT'S
FUN TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AN
INSTRUMENT AND, YOU KNOW, I
THINK IT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD FOR
ABOUT $15 WORTH OF PARTS.

KEEP IT GOING.
>> STEPHEN: WELL, MY GUEST
TONIGHT IS MARK FRAUENFELDER.
HIS BOOK IS MADE BY HAND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
PLAY US OUT ON THE BLUES.
