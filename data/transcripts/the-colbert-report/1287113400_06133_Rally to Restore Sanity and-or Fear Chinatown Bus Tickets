>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS
ABOUT MY MARCH TO KEEP FEAR
ALIVE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT FIRST, AS ALWAYS, MY MARCH
COVERAGE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
REESE'S, THE MOST TERRIFYING
CANDY BECAUSE WE TRACED A PHONE
CALL AND THE PEANUT BUTTER IS
COMING FROM INSIDE THE
CHOCOLATE.
GET OUT OF THERE.
HERE'S THE BIG NEWS: WE FOUND A
LOCATION FOR MY MARCH.
I AM HOLDING IT AT JON STEWART'S
RALLY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT IS NOW THE RALLY TO RESTORE
SANITY AND/OR FEAR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO IT IS WITH A HUMBLE HEART
THAT I SAY TO MY FRIEND JON
STEWART, SUCKER.
( LAUGHTER )
I GET A FREE PLACE FOR MY MARCH.
YOU DID EVERYTHING AND I DID
NOTHING.
I AM THE GARFUNKEL TO YOUR
SIMON.
HE HAS GOT TO PUT UP THE STAGE.
HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CLEANUP.
SO GET IN THOSE PORT-A-POTTIES
AND GO HOG WILD.
IT'S ON HIS TAB.
NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT IN THE
VIEWING AUDIENCE WHO WATCHED
"THE DAILY SHOW" TONIGHT, YOU
MIGHT HAVE SEEN OPRAH MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MY STUDIO
AUDIENCE IS UNAWARE OF.
SHE IS SENDING JON STEWART'S
AUDIENCE TO THE RALLY.
BUT NOT SENDING MY AUDIENCE.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, FOLKS,
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
SHHH.
FOLKS, IT'S OKAY.
MY GRANDFATHER HAD A SAYING.
HE USED TO SAY, [BLEEPED] OPRAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M YOUR OPRAH.
LOOK UNDERNEATH YOUR CHAIRS.
I AM BRINGING THIS STUDIO
AUDIENCE TO MY MARCH!
YOU'RE GOING TO THE MARCH AND
YOU'RE GOING TO THE MARCH AND
YOU'RE GOING TO THE MARCH.
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO MY MARCH!
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO MY MARCH!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WILL PAY FOR EVERYONE HERE
TONIGHT TO TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON,
D.C., ON A BUS FROM CHINATOWN.
THAT'S RIGHT, THE SHIN-WU BUS
LINE DEPARTING SOMEWHERE IN THE
BOWELS OF CHINATOWN AND DROPPING
YOU OFF IN AN UNDETERMINED
LOCATION IN THE D.C. METRO AREA.
ON SHIN-WU, YOU'LL LEARN THE
LATEST MANDARIN CURSE WORDS FROM
YOUR DRIVER.
AND SHIN-WU BOASTS THE LATEST IN
COMFORT TECHNOLOGY, LIKE SEATS,
AND OFTEN HAS WINDOWS.
REMEMBER, ON SHIN-WU, YOUR
CHICKEN RIDES FOR FREE.
[CLURKING]
A QUICK DISCLAIMER: SHIN-WU
TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
ENGINE FAILURE, LACK OF TOILETS
OR CHICKEN BITES.
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, I AM NOT
PUTTING YOU UP IN A HOTEL,
PAYING FOR YOUR MEALS OR

YOU'RE WELCOME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
