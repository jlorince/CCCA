(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER
GOVERNOR OF THE FORMER MICHIGAN.
PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER
GRANHOLM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOVERNOR GRANHOLM, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON.
LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU
FOR A LONG TIME.
>> WELL, ME, TOO, LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.
>> Stephen: THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE.
THANK YOU.
NOW, GOVERNOR, YOU'RE THE FORMER
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN,
ELECTED IN 2002, REELECTED IN
2006.
YOU NOW TEACH AT BERKLEE, YOU
WILL BE HOSTING CURRENT T.V.'S
UPCOMING SHOW "THE WAR ROOM"
WITH JENNIFER GRANHOLM.
SO WE GET IT, YOU'RE A LIBERAL.
>> ALL THE WAY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A TATTOO
OF MICHAEL MOORE RIDING A
DOLPHIN-SAFE TUNA?
HOW MUCH MORE LIBERAL COULD YOU
GET?
TELL ME ABOUT THE... YOUR NEW
BOOK IS CALL "A GOVERNOR'S
STORY: THE FIGHT FOR JOB'S AND
AMERICA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE."
YOUR STATE HAS HAD A REAL
ECONOMIC HILT.
IS MICHIGAN COMING BACK NOW?
>> IT IS, ACTUALLY.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION STEPPED
FORWARD TO SAVE THE AUTO
INDUSTRY AND AS A RESULT....
>> Stephen: BIG GOVERNMENT
TAKEOVER.
BIG GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER.
>> SMART GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE
TO SAVE THE BACKBONE OF THE
MANUFACTURING SECTOR OF THIS
COUNTRY, WHICH IS THE AUTO
INDUSTRY.
>> Stephen: BAILOUT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL BUT I
SAY IT'S JOBS.
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE JOB
BAILOUTS.
>> WELL, IT CERTAINLY SAVED JOBS
OF A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND
NOT JUST IN MICHIGAN BUT ALL
ACROSS THE INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST.
>> Stephen: NOW MITT ROMNEY SAYS
THAT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID BY
BAILING OUT THESE AUTO
INDUSTRIES IS BASICALLY WHAT HE
WAS DOING AT BAIN!
JUST GOING IN AND HELPING THESE
COMPANIES RECOVER OR NOT
RECOVER.
>> TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
HE CREATED
120,000 JOBS.
>> YES, HE DID.
>> Stephen:
>> WHAT HE DID AT BAIN WAS TO
TRY TO SAVE COMPANIES OR MAKE
PROFITS FOR HIS INVESTORS.
THAT WAS THE GOAL IS TO MAKE
PROGRESS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SAVING OF THE
AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ALL ABOUT
SAVING JOBS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU SAY THAT WHAT MICHIGAN
WENT THROUGH OVER THE LAST TEN
YEARS WAS A PREVIEW OF WHAT THE
REST OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO
FACE NOW.
LIKE MICHIGAN GOT IT FIRST.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND
US A MESSAGE?
(LAUGHTER)
WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND AN E-MAIL
THAT... IT'S A LITTLE LATE,
BABY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND AN E-MAIL
THAT SAYS SUBJECT: ECONOMY,
WE'RE SCREWED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BUT HERE'S THE THING.
I MEAN, IN THE PAST DECADE... SO
MICHIGAN LOST, OBVIOUSLY, MORE
MANUFACTURING JOBS, MORE
AUTOMOTIVE JOBS THAN ANY OTHER
STATE BECAUSE OF THE CHANNELS IN
THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR THE
COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCED.
SO WE'VE SEEN THIS LOSS OF THE
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
THE QUESTION IS FOR OUR NATION
AND YOUR FELLOW REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT A CANDIDATE
YET, THANK YOU.
>> OKAY, THE PEOPLE IN YOUR
CAMP.
YOUR PEOPLE.
WHAT ARE THEY PLANNING TO BE
ABLE TO CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA
IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY?
>> Stephen: IT'S TWO-PRONGED...
>> OH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
>> Stephen: NO, YOU'RE GOING TO
SAY IT'S CUTTING TAXES RIGHT?
>> CUTTING TAXES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S DEFINITELY
ONE WRONG.
CUTTING TAXES IS THE FIRST THING
AND THE SECOND ONE IS TAX CUTS.
(LAUGHTER)
THINK THAT'S A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THOSE TWO.
>> AND IT WORKED WELL UNDER
GEORGE BUSH, DIDN'T IT?
>> IT DID.
WE HAD A BOOM TIME!
I MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY NOW THAN
GEORGE BUSH.
I GOT MINE, JACK.
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING JUST
GREAT.
(APPLAUSE)
NOW YOU'RE... I WAS GOING TO SAY
YOUR HOME STATE BUT IT'S NOT
YOUR HOME STATE.
YOU'RE A TOUGH-TALKING
ATTRACTIVE CAPABLE DEMOCRATIC
FIRST FEMALE GOVERNOR OF
MICHIGAN BUT THERE IS A DARK
SECRET IN YOUR PAST THAT KEEPS
YOU FROM BEING PRESIDENT.
WOULD YOU TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT
IT IS.
>> THAT I WAS ON "THE DATING
GAME"?
>> Stephen: YOU WERE ON "THE
DATING GAME?"
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I WAS GOING TO... WELL,
BACHELORETTE NUMBER ONE... IS
DOES THAT FOOTAGE EXIST OUT
THERE?
>> THANK GOD NO.
I WAS 19.
IT WAS LONG AGO.
>> Stephen: OH, WE WERE ALL 19
ONCE.
I MEANT THAT YOU WERE FROM
CANADA.
>> I WAS BORN IN CANADA.
>> Stephen: SO YOU CAN'T RUN FOR
PRESIDENT.
(ONE AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERS)
>> WE HAVE A CANADIAN OUT HERE.
>> Stephen: OR A WAYWARD MOOSE
THAT JUST GOT GOOSED BY A LOON.
>> ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER AND I
HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON, AND
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
BOTH MARRIED... BOTH WERE ON
"THE DATING GAME."
>> Stephen: AND YOU CAN BOTH
BENCH 400.
>> (LAUGHS)
EXACTLY!
>> Stephen: MUST BE SO.
>> THE SECOND THING IS WE WERE
BOTH BORN OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE BORN IN
CANADA, CORRECT?
YOU'RE A MAPLE SYRUP BABY.
YOU SMUGGLED... YOU CAME IN,
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AT FOUR?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE GREEN
CARD AT FOUR?
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: YOU HAD A GREEN CARD
AT SHOWER IN
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR
SPECIAL SKILL?
BEING ADORABLE?
IN MICHIGAN, THAT IS MITT
ROMNEY'S HOME STATE.
>> YES, YES.
>> Stephen: HE'S GOING TO TAKE
THAT?
IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED...
>> NO!
NO!
MITT ROMNEY CAME TO MICHIGAN AND
WHILE WE WERE ON OUR KNEES HE
STABBED US IN THE BACK.
HE WROTE AN OP-ED IN THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" AND THE HEADLINE WAS
"LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT."
>> Stephen: HERE'S WHY I THINK
MITT ROMNEY IS GOING TO TAKE
MICHIGAN NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.
BECAUSE HIS NAME IS THE SHAPE OF
YOUR STATE.
(LAUGHTER)
BACHELORETTE NUMBER ONE, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
TODAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOVERNOR, THE BOOK IS "A
