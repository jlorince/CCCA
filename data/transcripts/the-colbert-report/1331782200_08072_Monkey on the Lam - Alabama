>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, ANYBODY WHO WATCHES THIS
SHOW KNOWS I'M NO FAN OF
MONKEYS.
EVER SINCE THAT CAN A PIEWCHIN
TRICKED ME INTO INVESTING IN HIS
BANANA PONZI SCHEME.
I GO APE WHEN THERE'S MONKEY
DANGER.
THIS IS MONKEY ON THE LAM.
TONIGHT, A WARNING TO THE
RESIDENTRÃ§ OF ALABAMA.
FIRST YOU LIVE IN ALABAMA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT A SECOND WARNING, WE GO TO
KGTV SAN DIEGO, ALABAMA'S MONKEY
NEWS LEADER.
>> AT THIS HOUR THE SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT IN WEST CENTRAL
ALABAMA COUNTY HAS SENT OUT AN
EXTRA PATROL AFTER REPORTS OF
ONE GORILLA SPOTTED NEAR A SMALL
TOWN.
THE NEAREST ZOO IS IN BIRMINGHAM
MORE THAN 100 MILES AWAY.
THE ZOO'S ONE GORILLA IS STILL
IN THE BORDERS.
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S A MYSTERY
GORILLA LOOSE IN ALABAMA.
AUTHORITIES ARE LOOKING FOR ONE
GORILLA BUT ACCORDING TO LOCAL
NEWS IT'S UNKNOWN HOW MANY ARE
LOOSE OR IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY
ARE HEADED.
THERE COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF
GORILLAS FROM 1 TO 10,000 BLOOD
THIRSTY APES ROOMING ALABAMA.
WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT WE HAVE
NO IDEA IF THAT GIANT MOB VOTED
IN LAST NIGHT'S ALABAMA PRIMARY.
I CAN ONLY ASSUME -- I CAN ONLY
ASSUME THE APES CAME OUT BIG FOR
SANTORUM.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION
EITHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE CREATED
IN THE IMAGE OF THEIR LORD AND
SAVIOR REESE CHRIST.
IN THIS IS WHY WE NEED STRICT
VOTER I.D. LAWS, PHONES.
THOUSANDS OF GORILLAS COULD HAVE
WALKED INTO THE POLLING PLACE
AND THROWN THIS ELECTION ALONG
WITH THEIR FECES.
SOME HAVE SAID IT'S A GORILLA.
OTHERS HAVE REPORTED SEEING WHAT
MAY HAVE BEEN A BEAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GORILLA OR
A BEAR OR BEAR GRYLLZ.
ALABAMA YAMS IF A MAN WITH AN
ENGLISH ACCENT ASKS TO DRINK
YOUR URINE GET OUT OF THERE.
IF YOU SEE ANY GORILLAS IN YOUR
MIDST ATTEMPT TO SAID DATE THEM.
I KNOW WHEN I'M IN THE SOUTH A
PLATE OF HUSH PUPPIES COULD PUT
ME DOWN FOR HOURS.
PLEASE BE VIGILANT.
IF WE'RE IN THE IT'S NOT THE
SOUTH THAT RISES AGAIN IT'S THE
PLANET OF THE APES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
