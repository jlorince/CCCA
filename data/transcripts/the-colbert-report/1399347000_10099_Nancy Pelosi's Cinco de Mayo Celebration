>> Stephen: THANK YOU,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I'M SORRY, I APOLOGIZE,FOLKS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, I APOLOGIZE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET PASTYOUR CHANTING AM I JUST
THOUGHT I COULD SNEAK PASTTHE CASTLEGATES OF YOUR LOVE
BUT YOU STOPPED ME, THANKYOU. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE ONE
OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANSOBSESSED WITH KNOWING WHAT
DAY IT IS, THEN YOU KNOWTHAT TODAY IS CINCO DE MAYO.
WHICH THIS YEAR IS LANDINGON THE 5th OF MAY.
(LAUGHTER)NOW UNFORTUNATELY, ONE
PERSON IS MAKING A CINCODEMOCKERY OF AMERICAN
VALUES.
CASA MINORITY LEADER NANCYPELOSI, IN HONOR OF THIS
YEAR'S CINCO DE MAYO SHERELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING
QUOTE THERE IS NO BETTER WAYTO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANT
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR COUNTRYOF AMERICA'S LATINO
COMMUNITY THAN BY ENACTINGCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
OH, THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
WE ALREADY DO SO MUCH ONCINCO DE MAYO TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS.
WE DRINK NOT UNO BUT DOSEQUIS.
AND MANY AMERICANS AREEATING TACOS TODAY, EVEN
THOUGH IT IS NOT TUESDAY.
(LAUGHTER)AND FRANKLY, LATINOS SHOULD
BE DEEPLY INSULTED THATPELOSI LUMPED ALL OF YOU
TOGETHER UNDER A MEXICANHOLIDAY.
THAT'S WHAT THE PUERTO RICANDAY PARADE IS FOR.
(LAUGHTER)BUT PELOSI REALLY STEPPED IN
IT WHEN SHE SAID THE TIME ISNOW FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO
EMULATE THE BRAVERYDEMONSTRATED IN THE BATTLE
OF PUEBLA.
EXCUSE ME?
THE BRAVERY OF THE BATTLE OFPUEBLA?
ONLY AMERICAN BATTLES CAN BEBRAVE, MADAME.
MAY I REMIND YOU THE BATTLEWAS BETWEEN THE MEXICANS AND
THE FRENCH.
WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU ROOTINGFOR IN THAT FIGHT, NANCY?
MEXICAN COMMANDER IGNACIOZARAGOZA OR FRENCH COUNT
CHARLES LORENCEZ? DOESN'TMATTER BECAUSE ULTIMATELY
THE FRENCH CAME BACK ANDCRUSHED THE MEXICANS LIKE
GUACAMOLE IN THE SECONDBATTLE INSTALLING ARCHDUKE
MAXIMILLIAN AS EMPEROR OFMEXICO WHO EVIDENTLY
NARROWLY ESCAPED A CANNONSHOT TO THE BEARD.
IF NANCY PELOSI REALLYWANTED REPUBLICANS TO GET
BEHIND IMMIGRATION REFORMSHE SHOULD HAVE INVOKED AN
AMERICAN BATTLE WITH MEXICOLIKE THE ALAMO.
I'M PRETTY SURE WE WON THATONE, OTHERWISE WHY WOULD WE
KEEP REMEMBERING IT.
