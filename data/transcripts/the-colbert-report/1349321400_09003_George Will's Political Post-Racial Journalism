LUCKILY, LUCKILY, WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST AND VENTRILOQUIST KNOWS WHY OBAMA IS AHEAD, RIGHTING THE NATION WHICH IS
RELUCTANT TO DECLARE A PRESIDENT A FAILURE IS ESPECIALLY RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP ON THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
YES.
SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY IT, THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY WINNING BECAUSE HE IS BLACK.
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID, OUR SYSTEM IS RIGGED IN FAVOR OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
NOW, I AM NOT GOING TO WIN AN KNAPP AWARD, NAACP AWARD FOR SAYING THIS BUT BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE GOTTEN ONE
FREE RIDE AFTER ANOTHER, STARTING WITH THE FIRST ONE, AND LET ME -- IT IS TRUE!  IT IS TRUE!
>> OKAY, LET ME ASK THE WHITE PEOPLE.
OKAY, LET ME ASK THE WHITE PEOPLE.
I BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE ONE OR ALL OF THEM IN MY AUDIENCE, RIGHT?  HAS A BLACK PERSON EVER THANKED YOU FOR FREEING THE
SLAVES?  WHEN I WALKED UP TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THE STREET AND SAY, YOU'RE WELCOME, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I AM
TALKING ABOUT.
IT IS LIKE WE DON'T TEACH IT IN THE SCHOOLS ANYMORE.
THE POINT IS, AMERICANS ARE AFRAID TO FIRE BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE OF WHITE GUILT.
AND WE HAVE GOT TO FREE OURSELVES FROM IT AS GEORGE WELL WRITES IN HIS CONTRACTUALLY MANDATED EXPENDED BASEBALL
ANALOGY, QUOTE, A SIGNIFICANT DATE IN THE NATION'S CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRESS WAS OCTOBER 3RD, 1974, WHEN FRANK ROBINSON WAS
HIRED BY THE CLEVELAND INDIANS AS THE MAJOR LEAGUE'S FIRST BLACK MANAGER, BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT MILESTONE OF PROGRESS
OCCURRED JUNE 19TH, 1977 WHEN THE INDIANS FIRED HIM, THAT WAS COLOR BLIND EQUALITY, ANOTHER RACIAL BARRIER HAD FALLEN.
FOLKS, I HAVE LONG APPRECIATED THE DEEP RELATION VOIR OF RACIAL SENSITIVITY THAT IS THE CLEVELAND INDIANS.
.. ME HAVE EM DREAM.
>> AND GEORGE IS RIGHT.
NOTHING SAYS RACIAL PROGRESS LIKE FIRING A BLACK PERSON.
I MEAN, THIS ARTICLE IS A MASTERFUL PIECE OF POLITICAL POST RACIAL JOURNALISM BY AN INTELLECTUAL TITAN.
IT PAINS ME TO SAY THAT GEORGE REALLY SCREWED THE POOCH ON THIS ONE.
GEORGE, YOU CAN'T JUST WRITE A COLUMN SAYING THE ONLY REASON WHITE PEOPLE ARE STILL VOTING FOR BARACK OBAMA IS BECAUSE HE
IS BLACK.
BECAUSE IF YOU COULD, MY AUNT RITA WOULD BE WRITING YOUR COLUMN, AND LET ME TELL YOU, SHE HAS GOT SOME PULITZER PRIZE
WINNING OPINIONS ABOUT THE GREEKS.
NO, THERE ARE FAR MORE DELICATE WAYS TO BRING UP OBAMA'S RACE.
IT IS A VERY IMPROBABLE AND EXOTIC LIFE, BECAUSE HE WAS RAISED VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS AND I THINK ACTUALLY VERY
DIFFERENT FROM MOST AMERICANS WORLD VIEW.
WE HAVE A VERY, VERY URBAN SENATOR, BARACK OBAMA.
>> I AM ASSUMING THERE IS SOME RHYTHM TO BARACK OBAMA THAT THE REST OF US DON'T UNDERSTAND.
>> SEE?  YOU CAN REMIND PEOPLE OBAMA IS BLACK WITHOUT OFFENDING THOSE WHO, LET'S SAY, TEND NOT
TO OWN NHL TEAMS.
THOSE KIND OF SENSITIVE CODE WORDS ARE JUST JOURNALISM 101, THIS GUY JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DO HIS JOB, AND YET THE
WASHINGTON POST KEEPS HIM YEAR AFTER YEAR.
I DON'T -- OH, MY GOD.
THERE IS ONLY ONE EXPLANATION.
GEORGE WILL IS BLACK!  I NEVER NOTICED.
BUT NOW YOU MENTIONED IT WITH THAT BOW TIE HE COULD BE NATION OF ISLAM.
, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE I DON'T SEE RACE, NOT EVEN MY OWN.
PEOPLE TELL ME I AM WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM, BECAUSE I THINK THE CHRONIC REFERS TO LOWER BACK PAIN, THE WASHINGTON POST, I
CALL ON YOU TO END THE SUBTLE RACISM OF LOWERED EXPECTATIONS YOU HAVE COMMITTED BY KEEPING AFRICAN-AMERICAN PIONEER GEORGE
WILL ON YOUR PAYROLL.
FIRE THIS MAN!  IT WOULD BE A TRUE BLOW TO CIVIL RIGHTS!  WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
