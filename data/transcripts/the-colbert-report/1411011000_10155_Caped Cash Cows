>> Stephen: NOW FOLKS,THERE'S SO MUCH HORRIBLE
NEWS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
THE EBOLA EPIDEMIC ISSPREADING.
ISIS CONTINUES THEIR REIGNOF TERROR AND EVIDENTLY, AND
I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING,THE NFL EMPLOYS SOME VIOLENT
PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)I KNOW.
WHO COULD PREDICT THAT?
BUT NO MATTER HOW ROUGH THENEWS GETS, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY, WHEN THE GOINGGETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH ESCAPE
INTO A WORLD OF FANTASY.
AND I AM PERSONALLY A HUGEFAN OF THE GENRE FROM THE
LORD OF THE RINGS, TO THECHRONICLES OF NARNIA TO THE
NOTEBOOKS OF GALILEO.
I MEAN THE EARTH GOES AROUNDTHE SUN?
PLEASE, I GOT TWO EYES, ICAN SEE.
HOW DID JOSHUA STOP THE SUNAT JERICHO, COME ON.
MY LOVE OF THE FORUM GOESALL THE WAY BACK TO HIGH
SCHOOL.
I USED TO FEEL SO ALONE.
IT WAS JUST-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LADIES, WHEREWERE YOU WHEN I WAS 16?
BACK THEN IT WAS JUST ME ANMY 20 SIDED DIE.
IN FACT, THAT DIE WAS MYPROM DATE.
I DID NOT GET LUCKY THATNIGHT.
SHE MANAGED TO ROLL A SAVINGTHROWING AGAINST MY MAGIC
WAND.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
NOW.
THE FANTASY MARKET ISBLOWING UP.
IN FACT, THE TWILIGHT SERIESALONE HAS EARNED OVER $5.7
BILLION DOLLARS
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,IF YOU LAID $5.7 BILLION
END-TO-END, IT WOULD STILLBE MORE INTERESTING THAN ANY
OF THE TWILIGHT MOVIES.
(APPLAUSE)BUT SUPERHEROES, FOLKS, BUT
SUPERHEROES ARE THE BIGGESTCAPED CASH COWS.
DC HAS MADE $8.9 BILLION ATTHE BOX OFFICE AND MARVEL'S
MOVIES HAVE DOUBLED THAT,PROVING ONCE AGAIN IT IS
MORE PROFITABLE TO BE ADEFENSE CONTRACTOR THAN A
JOURNALIST.
