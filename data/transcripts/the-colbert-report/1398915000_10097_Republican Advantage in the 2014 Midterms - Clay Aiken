I AM AN AIKEN FAN ORCLAYMATE.
I VOTED FOR HIM THROUGHSEASON 2.
WHEN HE LOST TO RUBENSTODDARD I WAS CRUSHED,
ALMOST AS CRUSHED AS I WASWHEN THEY VOTED OFF THAT OLD
LADY.
BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT CLAYAIKEN FOR CONGRESS.
NOT ONLY IS HE A DEMOCRAT,HE IS ALSO A GAY WHICH I
ONLY RECENTLY DISCOVEREDWERE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.
(LAUGHTER)AND I CANNOT BELIEVE HE'S
TRYING TO GET RENEE ELLMERSFIRED.
DOES HE NOT KNOW HOW BADLYSHE NEEDS HER PAYCHECK?
IF HE WERE ON MY SHOW RIGHTNOW, I'D VOTE HIM OFF.
HERE TO BE KICKED OUT OF MYSTUDIO, PLEASE WELCOME
FORMER AMERICAN ALMOST IDOLAND CANDIDATE FOR NORTH
CAROLINA'S SECOND DISTRICT,CLAY AIKEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

OKAY.
I AM UNCHARMED BY THOSE BABYBLUES AND THOSE GOLDEN
PIPES.
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINKYOU ARE, YOU HOLLYWOOD
LIBERAL, COMING INTO NORTHCAROLINA WITH YOUR SAN
FRANCISCO VALUES.
>> WELL, I THINK PEOPLE AREVERY FED UP WITH THE KIND OF
TONE DEAF REPRESENTATIONTHEY'VE HAD.
YOU HEARD-- .
>> Stephen: TONE DEAF JUSTBECAUSE YOU HAVE PERFECT
PITCH?
THAT'S KIND OF CHEAP.
>> I MEAN YOU SEE WHAT WEARE DEALING WITH NOW.
WE'VE GOT A REPRESENTATIVENOW WHO HAS COMPLETELY
IGNORED THE PEOPLE WHO SHEWAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOWABOUT THE COMPLETELY IGNORED
THING.
BUT HOW ARE YOU NOT GOING TOCOMPLETELY IGNORE THEM.
>> WELL, I HAVE SPENT MYENTIRE LIFE SINCE IDOL
TRYING TO STAND UP FORCHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.
I STARTED AN ORGANIZATIONFOR KIDS WITH DISABILITIES.
AND HAVE BEEN AN ADVOCATEFOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS FOR
THE PAST 11 YEARS.
AND THESE PEOPLE IN NORTHCAROLINA PUT ME HERE.
THEY GAVE ME THIS PLATFORM,THIS MICROPHONE.
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S MYRESPONSIBILITY TO USE THAT
TO GIVE BACK TO THEM ANDMAKE SURE THEY'RE
REPRESENTED IN A WAY.
>> Stephen: I'M UNWARMED BYYOUR STORY.
THAT'S MY DISABILITY, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T HEAR THINGS I DON'TLIKE.
SO FT. BRAGG, LARGESTMILITARY BASE IN THE WORLD
IS IN YOUR DISTRICT.
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RUN TOTHE RIGHT OF A REPUBLICAN ON
DEFENSE.
>> WHY WOULD I NEED TO RUNTO THE RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THERIGHT OWNS DEFENSE, MY
FRIEND.
>> I THINK WHAT THE RIGHTDOESN'T OWN IS VETERAN'S
AFFAIRS, THE VETERAN'SUNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 11%,
FOUR POINTS HIGHER THAN THEREST OF THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION THERE ARE A LOTOF REALLY INCREDIBLE
PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE THATAREN'T GETTING ANYWHERE
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MOREINTERESTED IN SHUTTING DOWN
THE GOVERNMENT,SEQUESTRATION, DOING THINGS
TO MAKE SURE THE OTHER SIDEDOESN'T GET A WIN.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREHURTING NOW AND NOTHING IS
GETTING DONE IN CONGRESSBECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO WORK
TOGETHER.
THAT FRUSTRATES ME.
I'M SURE IT FRUSTRATES YOUEVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT IT FRUSTRATES ALOT OF FOLKS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: I WILL HAPPILYADMIT THAT PARTISAN
POLITICAL BICKERING IS HOW IMAKE MY LIVING.

IN D.C. MAKE THEIR LIVINGTOO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.

TOUR OF YOURS.

>> I MIGHT SING IT HERE ORTHERE BUT I'M GOING LEAVE
IT TO YOU.
>> Stephen: OH SAY -->> I FELL LIKE THAT WAS-- I
HAVE HAD A GREAT 11 YEARSSINGING.
AND THIS IS THE NEW CHAPTERFOR ME.
I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANTTHAN SINGING AND SO I HAVE
PUT THAT ON THE BACK BURNERFOR SURE.
