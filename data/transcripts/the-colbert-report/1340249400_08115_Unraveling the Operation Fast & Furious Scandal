WE'LL GET PHLEGM CHINA.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, NOT THAT MEXICO ISN'T STILL A PROBLEM IN ITS OWN RIGHT.
CASE IN POINT: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S ONGOING COVERUP OF OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS.
I'M SO MAD ABOUT THIS, FOLKS,
JUST THINKING ABOUT FAST AND FURIOUS MAKES ME... I DON'T KNOW, QUICKLY ANGRY.
(LAUGHTER) FAST AND FURIOUS IS THE BIGGEST SCANDAL IN HISTORY THAT I HAVE
FORGOT ON THE EVER TALK ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT LUCKILY FOX NEWS DID NOT.
>> OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS.
>> OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS.
>> OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS.
>> OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS.
THAT WAS THAT BOTCHED THING WHERE THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL,
TOBACCO, FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES SOLD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF WEBS TO VIOLENT MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS.
>> Stephen: YES, FAST AND FURIOUS WAS AN UNCONSCIONABLE WASTE OF MONEY TO PROMOTE
SENSELESS ACTS OF VIOLENCE-- JUST LIKE THE MOVIES IT WAS NAMED FOR.
(LAUGHTER) SINCE 2011, FOLKS, CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE AND SLYTHERIN HOUSE MASTER DARRELL ISSA HAS DEMANDED...
(LAUGHTER).
HAS DEMANDED KEY DOCUMENTS THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER HAS BRAZENLY WITHHELD ON THE FLIMSY
EXCUSE THAT THEY WOULD ENDANGER UNDERCOVER AGENTS.
FOLKS, THAT'S TOO CONVENIENT.
I THINK HOLDER IS HIDING A FAR MORE SINISTER TRUTH.
>> FAST AND FURIOUS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT?
LET'S GET SOME GUNS FROM SOME ARIZONA GUN SHOPS INTO THE HANDS OF SOME DRUG CARTELS AND LET
THEM START WIPING PEOPLE OUT,
THEN WE'LL SPREAD THE NEWS THAT THOSE GUNS CAME FROM AMERICA!
>> THEY'RE FLOODING MEXICO WITH GUNS SO THEY CAN TURN AROUND AND
SAY LOOK AT ALL THESE GUNS SHOWING UP AT VIOLENT CRIME SCENES IN MEXICO.
WE HAVE TO REGULATE THESE GUN SHOPS IN AMERICA.
>> VERY CLEARLY THEY MADE A CRISIS AND THEY'RE USING THIS CRISIS TO SOMEHOW TAKE AWAY OR
LIMIT PEOPLE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
>> Stephen: YES, VERY CLEARLY!
OBAMA STARTED THIS GUN-TRACKING PROGRAM IN 2006 WHEN HE HYPNOTIZED GEORGE BUSH.
(LAUGHTER) THEN HE SECRETLY ORDER ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER TO ORDER THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO ORDER THE A.T.F. TO ORDER GUN SHOPS TO SELL GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG
CARTELS AND THEN LOSE TRACK OF THEM THEREBY PANICKING AMERICANS TO GIN UP SUPPORT FOR THE
DRACONIAN GUN CONTROL MEASURES THAT OBAMA HAS NEVER INTRODUCED.
(LAUGHTER) COMPLICATED?
YES.
THE FEVERED RAMBLES OF A SYPHILITIC BRAIN, PERHAPS?
BUT OCCAM'S RAZOR SAYS MY ANSWER IS RIGHT OR I WILL CUT YOU WITH A RAZOR.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, FOLKS, TO PUT A STOP TO THIS VERY CLEAR PLOT, TODAY CONGRESS TOOK ACTION.
>> THE VOTE HAS JUST COME THROUGH HERE.
ISSA AND THE HOUSE PANEL HAS FOUND HOLDER IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
>> Stephen: SHOCKING THAT THEY FOUND SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T ALREADY
