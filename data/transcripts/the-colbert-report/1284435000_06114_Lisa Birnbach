EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT RELEASED THE
BOOK "THE OFFICIAL PREPPIE
HANDBOOK" IN 1980.
WHO WOULD HAVE THAWING 30 YEARS
LATER WE'D STILL HAVE PREP BYES
BUT NOT BOOKS?
PLEASE WELCOME LISA BURNBACH.
THERE YOU GOSH, YOUNG LADY.
>> HOW DO YOU DO?
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU RELEASED
THIS BOOK 30 YEARS AGO.
>> A DIFFERENT BOOK 30 YEARS
AGO.
BUT STILL 30 YEARS AGO.
I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT FACE
CREAM YOU'RE USING.
>> IT'S GOOD GENES I GUESS.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT PREPPIE IS ABOUT.
>> IT REALLY IS, THE LUCK OF THE
JEANS.
>> Stephen: THIS BOOK IS
CALLED "TRUE PREP: IT'S A WHOLE
NEW OLD WORLD."
THIS IS A SEEK WELL, A REVISIT
OF THE CLASSIC 1980 OFFICIAL
PREPPIE HANDBOOK, CORRECT?
>> IT'S A LOOK AT PREPPIES IN
THE 21st CENTURY.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW BOOK.
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A SEEK WELL.
>> Stephen: THE OFFICIAL
PREPPIE HANDBOOK WAS INCREDIBLY
INFLUENTIAL TO ME.
AND I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO A YOUNG
STEPHEN COLBERT IF IN 1980 HE
HAD WALKED INTO THAT BOOK STORE
AND BOUGHT MAYA ANGELOU OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF
THE OFFICIAL PREPPIE HANDBOOK.
IT MADE ME WHO I AM.
WHO AM I THEN?
AS OF WHAT IS PREP TO PEOPLE WHO
DON'T UNDERSTAND?
>> A PREPPIE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS
TREMENDOUS EASE, TREMENDOUS
CONFIDENCE, A LITTLE GOOFY, A
LITTLE SPORTY, AND USES RECEIVED
WISDOM BECAUSE HAVING NEW IDEAS
OF YOUR OWN IS NOT PREP.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU NEED
NEW IDEAS IF THE IDEAS YOU HAVE
IS WORKING FOR YOU?
>> AND IF IT WORKED FOR MOMMY
AND DADDY, SO MUCH THE BETTER.
>> Stephen: AND GRANDDADDY.
>> AND GRANDDADDY.
IT'S SOMEBODY WHO HAS A CLASSIC
OUTLOOK ON LIFE AS WELL AS A
CLASSIC WARDROBE.
>> Stephen: BUT IS THERE STILL
A PREP?
WITH THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT IS,
WITH THE OLD FAMILIES MARRYING,
LET'S FACE IT, FRINGE PEOPLE...
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT THE RIGHT TERM?
I'M TRYING TO BE GENTLE.
>> PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE WAY.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE FROM ACROSS
THE WAY.
IS THERE STILL A PREP IF IT IS
NOT GENERATIONAL INHERITED
PREPNESS?
ISN'T THAT THE HALLMARK OF
PREPNESS?
>> THERE IS A KIND OF PREPPIE
THAT GREW UP THAT WAY WHO IS
THE...
>> Stephen: TO THE MANOR BORN.
>> EXACTLY.
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER
MYSELF.
>> Stephen: NO, YOU COULDN'T
HAVE IT.
>> I COULDN'T SAY IT AT ALL.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> AND SOMEBODY WHO IS RACED
THIS WAY BY MANY GENERATIONS
WEARING OLD SWEATERS, READING
OLD YEAR BOOKS AND HAS NOTHING
NEW TO SAY.
BUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE
WHO ARE ASPIRING TO PREP COME,
AND FOR THEM THIS IS A MOMENT
WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY SAY, I
WANT TO SELF-IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
THAT ALLOWS ME TO WEAR KHAKIS,
ALLOWS ME TO DRINK BLOODIES AND
ALLOWS ME TO CASUALLY TOSS MY
SWEATER OVER MY SHOULDER.
>> Stephen: AND CASUALLIES
TOs AWAY ANY IDEAS THAT DO NOT
FIT IN WITH PREP DOM.
PREP DOM IS ABOUT FITTING IN.
>> THE WORLD HAS CHANGED.
THAT'S WHY THIS BOOK HAS COME TO
BE.
>> Stephen: PREPPIES DON'T
CHANGE.
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.
THEY CALCIFY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THEY DON'T CHANGE, BUT WHAT
ARE WE GOING TO DO IN A WORLD
WITH POLAR FLEECE AND THE
INTERNET AND THINGIES THAT BUZZ
AND RING?
WE HAVE TO...
>> Stephen: THEY'RE NOT
ALLOWED IN THE CLUB ROOM.
>> THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED AT THE
TABLE.
YOU MAY NOT TEXT AT THE TABLE.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE YOU MAY
NOT TEXT AT THE TABLE.
>> WELL, TELL THEM.
>> Stephen: DON'T TEXT AT THE
TABLE, NOT IN THE FORMER DINING
ROOM, BUT IF YOU WANT TO EAT ON
THE LOGE, YOU CAN TEXT THERE.
>> WE DON'T RECOMMEND YOU WEAR
SOCKS AT ANY TIME UNLESS IT'S
VERY, VERY COLD OUT.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY I'M ONE OF
THE TRUE PREPS.
I'M AN AVERAGE JOE WHO JUST
HAPPENS TO KNOW AT A WHITE TIE
DINNER PARTY THAT YOU DON'T TALK
TO THE GUY WITH THE BLACK TIE...
>> BECAUSE HE'S THE BUTLER.
>> Stephen: HE'S THE BUTLER.
EXACTLY.
>> EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE PREPPIES DON'T
DO...
>> THAT.
>> Stephen: THEY DON'T DO
THAT.
>> WE NEVER DO THAT.
>> Stephen: LISA BURNBACH.
THE BOOK IS "TRUE PREP: IT'S A
WHOLE NEW OLD WORL
