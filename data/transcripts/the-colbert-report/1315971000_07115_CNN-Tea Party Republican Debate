( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: YES!
YES!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU!
I WANT TO THANK YOU.
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
UNINTELLIGIBLE ARGLE BARGLE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AT THE
"REPORT."
WE HAVE A LOT OF SHOW TO GET TO,
FOLKS.
TONIGHT I HAVE NOT ONE, NOT
THREE BUT TWO NOBEL PRIZE
WINNERS AS MY GUEST.
PAUL KRUGMAN AND VICE PRESIDENT
AL GORE.
JUST WATCHING TONIGHT'S
BROADCAST QUALIFIES YOU FOR A
BACHELOR'S DEGREE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHICH, IN TURN, QUALIFIES YOU
FOR NOTHING.
(LAUGHTER)
SPEAKING OF QUALIFIED FOR
NOTHING, WOLF BLITZER.
(LAUGHTER)
LAST NIGHT, WOLF HOSTED A CNN
TEA PARTY PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
WHERE HE TRIED TO AMBUSH RON
PAUL BY ASKING WHETHER SOCIETY
SHOULD PAY FOR SOMEONE IN A COMA
WHO DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE.
>> THAT'S WHAT FREEDOM IS ALL
ABOUT, TAKING YOUR OWN RISKS.
THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO
PREPARE AND TAKE CARE OF
EVERYBODY...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT SOCIETY
SHOULD JUST LET HIM DIE?
>> NO...
>> YES!
>> YES!
>> Stephen: YEAH!
(LAUGHTER)
I SAY WE PERSONALLY TELL THAT
STUPID COMA GUY TO SUCK IT!
(LAUGHTER)
IN MORSE CODE HAND SQUEEZES.
OH, THEY'RE IN THERE.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, THIS IS STONE-HEARTED
REALISM AND IT'S A PROVEN CROWD
PLEASER AT G.O.P. DEBATES.
>> GOVERNOR PERRY, QUESTION
ABOUT TEXAS.
YOUR STATE HAS EXECUTED 234
DEATH ROW INMATES, MORE THAN ANY
OTHER GOVERNOR IN MODERN TIMES.
HAVE YOU...
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHAT!
WHAT!
WHOO!
234!
HE'S THE BARRY BONDS OF
EXECUTIONS!
(LAUGHTER)
OH, GOD, OH, GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HOPE PERRY HASN'T BEEN
JUICING.
I WOULD HATE FOR THOSE DEATHS TO
BE TAINTED.
NATION, THESE DEBATES ARE
SUPPOSED TO HELP US FIND THE
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, BUT THEY HAVE ALREADY
HELPED US TO FIND HIS RUNNING
MATE-- THE GRIM REAPER.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT, THE ANGEL OF
DEATH.
CLEARLY HE IS POPULAR WITH THE
G.O.P. BASE THIS YEAR.
HE'S GOT ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR: HE'S OLD
AND BONE WHITE.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S PACKING A WEAPON.
HE'S GOT AN INCREDIBLE WAR
RECORD.
AND BELIEVE ME, NO ONE WANTS TO
GET RID OF OBAMACARE MORE THAN
THIS GUY.
PLUS HE IS A CLOSE SECOND TO
RICK PERRY IN EXECUTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT DON'T WORRY, MITT ROMNEY, IF
THE GRIM REPUBLICER IS IN
PERRY'S CAMP, YOU'VE STILL GOT
