NATION, MARCH MADNESS HAS NEARLYCOME TO A CLOSE, WHICH MEANS
WE'LL SOON LEARN WHICH FINALFOUR TEAM HAS WON THE CHAMPIONS'
RIGHT TO SET FIRE TO EVERY CARON CAMPUS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT ENJOY THE ACTION WHILE YOU
CAN, BECAUSE SOON, COLLEGESPORTS AS WE KNOW IT WILL BE
OVER.
>> IT'S JUST A FIRST STEP, BUTTHERE WAS A REMARKABLE RULING
TODAY THAT COULD REVOLUTIONIZECOLLEGE SPORTS.
A REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THENATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
RULED THAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHORECEIVE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS
QUALIFY AS EMPLOYEES AND MAYLEGALLY UNIONIZE.
>> Stephen: UNIONIZE?!
PLAYERS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO WANTMONEY.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN IT FORTHE LOVE OF SELLING SPONSORSHIP
TO TOSTITOS.
(LAUGHTER)AND THEY MADE THIS DECISION FOR
THE WORST POSSIBLE REASON.
>> THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONSBOARD IN CHICAGO HAD ITS
REGIONAL DIRECTOR BASE THEDECISION ON THE CONTROL THE
COACHES HAVE OVER THE LIVES OFSCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES TO FIND
THAT PLAYERS SPEND 50 TO 60HOURS PER WEEK ENGAGING IN
FOOTBALL-RELATED ACTIVITIES.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OFCONTROL AN EMPLOYER HAS OVER AN
EMPLOYEE.
>> Stephen: OH, RIDICULOUS!
NORTHWESTERN PLAYERS AREN'TEMPLOYEES OF THE UNIVERSITY --
THEY DON'T GET "PAID."
TECHNICALLY, THEY'RE "SLAVES" OFTHE UNIVERSITY.
(LAUGHTER)THE FIVE'S ERIC BOLLING KNOWS
THE NIGHTMARE  WE'LL BE STUCKWITH AFTER UNIONS TAKE HOLD.
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE, JUST TAKETHIS ONE STEP FURTHER.
A FOOTBALL TEAM IN THE MIDDLE OFSUMMER DOING DOUBLES WHEN IT'S
HOT?
A PLAYER GOES, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS AGAINST MY LABOR BOARDRELATIONS.
HERE IT IS.
RIGHT HERE.
I HAVE THIS DOCUMENT THAT SAYS ICAN'T RUN IN 100-DEGREE HEAT.
>> Stephen: YEAH, UNIONS WILLTURN OUR PLAYERS INTO WIMPS.
YOU GOTTA BE TOUGH!
YOU DON'T HEAR THE MASCOTCOMPLAINING ABOUT THE HEAT,
MOSTLY BECAUSE HE PASSED OUTHOURS AGO INSIDE HIS PUMA SUIT.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
BUT THE N.C.-DOUBLE-ALLIGATORSBEHIND THIS CAMPAIGN LIKE FORMER
NORTHWESTERN QUARTERBACK KAINCOLTER REFUSE TO BACK DOWN.
>> STUDENT ATHLETES DON'T HAVE AVOICE.
THEY DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THETABLE.
THE CURRENT MODEL RESEMBLES ADICTATORSHIP.
>> Stephen: DICTATORSHIP?
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
HOW IS GATHERING IN A STADIUM TOCHANT IN UNISON AS UNIFORMED MEN
MOVE IN FORMATION LIKE ADICTATORSHIP?
(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT THESECLEAT-BOOTED THUGS ARE
DEMANDING.
>> COLTER SAYS ATHLETES AREMISSING OUT ON FULLY-FUNDED
ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS, DUEPROCESS FOR ALLEGED NCAA
VIOLATIONS, AND GUARANTEEDCOVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES
FOR CURRENT AND FORMER PLAYERS.
>> YOU KNOW, THESE ARE OUR LIVESAND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE'RE PROTECTED.
>> Stephen: YOU AREPROTECTED...
THAT'S WHAT THE CUP IS FOR.
(LAUGHTER)AND MEDICAL COVERAGE IS A BURDEN
THESE SCHOOLS CAN'T AFFORD.
YES, COLLEGE ATHLETES HELPGENERATE MORE THAN $16 BILLION
IN TELEVISION CONTRACTS.
BUT HAVE YOU BEEN TO A COLLEGECAFETERIA?
THERE'S UNLIMITED CEREAL!
YOU CAN KISS THAT GOODBYE NOW.
NOW I HEAR THAT NORTHWESTERNGRADUATES SOME QUALITY PEOPLE
WITH EXCELLENT EDUCATIONS.
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT TO KEEPATHLETES IN LINE WHEN YOU'RE
OFFERING CLASSES LIKE ECON 339 - LABOR ECONOMICS?
TIME TO REPLACE THAT WITHSOMETHING MORE APPROPRIATE TO
FOOTBALL, LIKE BIO-104, INTRO TOSKULL TRAUMA.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
WHAT ARE THESE PLAYER UNIONPEOPLE THINKING?
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL FIND OUTFROM THE HEAD OF THE COLLEGE
ATHLETES PLAYERS ASSOCIATION,RAMOGI HUMA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
