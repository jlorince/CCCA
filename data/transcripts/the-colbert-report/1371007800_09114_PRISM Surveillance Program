STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
YOU KNOW I NEED IT.
YOU KNOW I NEED IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS, PLEASE, FOLKS.
PLEASE, FOLKS, YOU KNOW,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
CHANTING MY NAME.
JESUS HIMSELF SAID MAN
CANNOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE
BUT BY EVERY WORD, JUST
CHANTED BY YOUR AUDIENCE.
FOLKS, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO
THE STORY EVERYONE'S TALKING
ABOUT.
THE NSA KNOWS WHAT
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER)
AND ACCORDING TO STUNNING
NEW ARTICLES FIRST PUBLISHED
BY FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND
PROFESSIONAL BLABBERMOUTH
GLEN GREENWALD IN THE U.K.'S
THE GUARDIAN THE NEWSPAPER,
THE NSA IS ALSO ENGAGING IN
CYBERSNOOPING.
>> NSA THE NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY HAS ASSETS TO THE
CENTRAL SERVERS TO SOME OF
THE TOP U.S. TECHNOLOGY
FIRMS THROUGH A PROGRAM
CALLED PRISM, THOSE FIRMS
BEING MICROSOFT, GOOGLE,
YAHOO!, FACEBOOK, APPLE, AOL,
SKYPE, YOUTUBE AND PAL TALK.
>> Stephen: YOU HEARD RIGHT.
THEY'RE MONITORING PAL TALK.
WELL, FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.
WE ARE THIS CLOSE TO
LEARNING WHAT PAL TALK IS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THIS BETRAYAL OF OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY COMES
COURT SEE OF FORMER CIA
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND
NERD TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A
COOL GUY TRYING TO LOOK LIKE
A NERD EDWARD SNOWDEN.
SNOWDEN LEAKED A TOP SECRET
POWER POINT PRESENTATION
THAT DETAILED HOW THE
GOVERNMENT GATHERS MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION ON
EVERYTHING BUT GRAPHIC
DESIGN.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS, THIS SECRET
PROGRAM'S NAME PRISM IS AN
ACRONYM FOR PLANNING TOOL
FOR RESOURCE INTEGRATION
SYNCHRONIZATION AND
MANAGEMENT.
INCIDENTALLY, FOR REVEALING
PRISM, SNOWDEN MAY SOON BE
IN PRISON, FOR, PROBABLY,
REGRETTING, IDENTIFYING,
SELF, ON, NATIONAL, TV.
NOW DESPITE BEING IMPLICATED
IN THE POWER POINT GOOGLE
DENIES THEIR INVOLVEMENT
SAYING IN A STATEMENT THAT
GOOGLE DOES NOT HAVE A BACK
DOOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO
ACCESS PRIVATE USER DATA.
MAYBE SO.
BUT WHEN I GOOGLED THE WORDS
BACK DOOR AND PRIVATE ACCESS,
I SURE FOUND EVIDENCE OF
DISTURBING PROBING.
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING,
FOLKS, THAT I DO NOT LIKE
ABOUT THIS WHOLE NSA
SURVEILLANCE.
IT'S HAPPENING ON PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S WATCH.
AND IT'S EARNING HIM HIGH
PRAISE FROM CONSERVATIVES.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IS AS
IF GEORGE BUSH IS BACK IN
OFFICE.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
STEPS HE HAS TAKEN TO FIGHT
TERROR TO KEEP HIM SAFE IT
IS MUCH ABOUT WHAT GEORGE
BUSH STARTED AND CONTINUED.
WIRETAPS, INDEFINITE
DETENTION, KEEPING
GUANTANAMO OPEN, IT'S DRONE
STRIKES.
I REFER TO IT AS PRESIDENT
BUSH'S FOURTH TERM.
>> Stephen: SHUT UP, BALDY!
GEORGE W. BUSH IS MY HERO.
HE IS MY ROLE MODEL.
HE IS MY DESIGNATED DRIVER.
THIS GUY, THIS GUY IS JUST
IMITATING, IT WILL MAKE ME
LIKE HIM.
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY BALL
GAME US TAKE PLE TO OR HOW
MANY CITIZENS YOU BLOW UP,
YOU'RE NOT MY REAL
PRESIDENT.
YOU'RE JUST SOME GUY NAMED
BARRY!
(LAUGHTER)
I HATE YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND FOLKS, WHILE THERE'S A
LOT OF TALK ABOUT E-MAILS
AND PHONE CALLS, I AM WAY
MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW
SURVEILLANCE DEVICES THAT
THEY ARE COOKING UP.
>> IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO
KNOW WHEN I'M USING MY
MICROWAVE OVEN.
>> GENERAL PETRAEUS WHEN HE
RAN THE CIA GAVE A SPEECH
THAT HE THOUGHT WAS SECRET
AND SOMEBODY COPIED IT AND
MADE IT PUBLIC THAT SAID NEW
MIKE WAVES AND DISHWASHERS
THAT HAVE COMPUTER CHIPS IN
THERE THAT THEY CAN ACCESS
SO THEY KNOW WHEN YOUS ARE
USING YOUR MICROWAVE AND
DISHWASHER.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT
SURPRISED THEY PUT
SURVEILLANCE CHIPS IN
MICROWAVES.
WE KNOW THEY ALREADY HAVE
METAL DETECTORS.
AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT
PEOPLE ARE NUKING.
I MEAN ISN'T A MICROWAVE
BORE ITO?
-- BURRITO, A, THEY ARE
FOREIGN AND I KNOW FOR A
FACT THEY HAVE EXPLOSIVE
POTENTIAL.
BUT LOOK, FOLKS, LOOK--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I CAN ADMIT THAT THIS
GUARDIAN STORY DOES RAISE A
LOT OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
LIBERALS ASK IF WE ARE
SACRIFICING TOO MUCH FREEDOM
FOR SECURITY.
CONSERVATIVES ASK IF WE ARE
SHOWING OUR HAND TO THE
TERRORISTS BUT THE GUARDIAN
ASKS THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION OF ALL, COULD THE
GUARDIAN WIN A PULITZER FOR
EDWARD SNOWDEN'S NSA
REVELATIONS?
WHICH LEADS ME TO ASK, COULD
I WIN AN EMMY FOR MY REPORT
ON THE GUARDIAN WONDERING IF
THEY COULD WIN A PULITZER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND --
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> I HOPE YOU'RE VOTERS.
AND WILL MY MORNING RERUN BE
ELIGIBLE FOR A KID'S CHOICE
AWARD.
SHOULD WE EVEN BE DISCUSSING
THIS?
WELL, THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO
THINK SO.
>> NOW I WELCOME THIS
DEBATE.
AND I THINK IT'S HEALTHY FOR
OUR DEMOCRACY.
>> Stephen: YES, I WELCOME
IT TOO, VERY HEALTHY.
IT'S A DEBATE WELL WORTH
HAVING.
THE MOMENT WE FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT IN 2006.
SO ALSO LET'S HAVE A DEBATE
ABOUT WHY THE GILMORE GIRLS
WERE CANCELLED.
BECAUSE FOLKS, THE FACT IS
WE HAD THIS DEBATE.
AND WE SURRENDERED OUR
RIGHTS BACK WHEN WE WERE
PROPERLY IN THE GRIP OF
FEAR.
AND I KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY.
WE'VE GOT TO DIG DOWN DEEP
AND SOMEHOW FIND THE COURAGE
TO STAY SCARED [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE IF IT REALLY BOTHERS
YOU, FOLKS, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF WAYS TO AVOID THIS
GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE.
JUST DON'T TEXT, TWEET, MAKE
PHONE CALLS, OR USE PAL TALK
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT'S A
SACRIFICE.
INSTEAD, INSTEAD IF YOU
ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NEED
TO GET A MESSAGE TO A FRIEND,
JUST DO WHAT OUR GRANDPARENTS
DID, AND USE A CARRIER
CHICKEN.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
SIMPLE PROCESS, OKAY.
SIMPLE PROCESS, ALL RIGHT.
JUST SEND A MESSAGE TO MY
BUDDY HERE, MY BUDDY LOU
DAWG.
WHAT'S UP, WHAT UP, LOU
DAWG!
THINGS ARE CHILL HERE.
CAN I POP BY LATER FOR SOME
FRIED CARRIER CHICKEN?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ROLL
THAT UP THERE.
RIGHT THERE.
THERE YOU GO.
AND UH-HUH THERE YOU GO.
AND GO FIND LOU DAWG.
(LAUGHTER)
