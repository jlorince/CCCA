EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT DIRECTED THE
MOVIES "HELL BOY" AND "HELL BOY
2."
I SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME HE HAD BAR
MITZVAH AND BECOME A HELL MAN.
PLEASE WELCOME GUILLERMO DEL
TORO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. TELL OR THE ROW, NICE
TO MEET YOU.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
VERY EXCITED TO HAVE YOU ON.
I'M A GIANT FAN.
>> THANK YOU.
I'M A GIANT GUEST.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
YES, YOU ARE.
WE'RE SHOOTING THIS IN IMAX.
BESIDES... YOU ARE WHAT I CALL A
POWERHOUSE OF THE FANTASTICAL.
>> OH, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: ANYBODY EVER CALL
YOU THAT BEFORE?
>> NOT IN THE FAMILY.
>> Stephen: TRADEMARK.
TRADEMARK.
NOW, BESIDES DIRECTING "HELL
BOY," "HELL BOY 2", "PANS
LABYRINTH," YOU GOT THIS NEW
BOOK OUT, THE SECOND IN A
SERIES, "THE FALL."
IT'S PART OF A SERIES OF VAMPIRE
BOOKS YOU'RE WORKING ON.
>> BUT NOT SPARKLY ONES.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE NOT YOUNG
AND REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND THERE
SEEMS TO BE NO DOWN SIDE TO
BEING A VAMPIRE?
>> THESE ARE NASTY, PARASITIC,
VERY SCARY CREATURES, AND, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE
VAMPIRES LESS OF A DATE AND MORE
OF A PREDATOR.
>> Stephen: THE GREATEST FEAR
IS THE VAMPIRE MIGHT BREAK UP
WITH YOU VIA E-MAIL.
THIS IS OLD SCHOOL VAMPIRE.
>> REALLY SCARY, BRUTAL
VAMPIRES.
>> Stephen: SO IS THERE ANY
SEX?
>> NOT IN THE BOOK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: UM, YOU... UM, WHY
DO YOU LOVE MONSTERS SO MUCH
BECAUSE YOUR MONSTERS ARE
FANTASTIC.
WHAT I LOVE, PARTICULARLY ABOUT
THE "HELL BOY" SERIES IS THERE
IS A... THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT
FROM EACH OTHER, YET YOU CAN SEE
YOUR ARTISTIC HAND IN ALL THE
MONSTERS.
THEY'RE COHESIVE IN THEIR
DIFFERENCE.
>> I THINK OF THEM... I KNOW
MORE ABOUT MONSTERS THAN I KNOW
ABOUT MY COUSINS OR MY FAMILY.
>> Stephen: ARE THEY LIKE
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY?
>> PRETTY MUCH.
I IMAGINE THEM.
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THESE
VAMPIRES FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.
I WAS A VERY STRANGE CHILD.
>> Stephen: IN WHAT WAY?
>> I USED TO READ... THE FIRST
HORROR BOOK I BOUGHT WAS AT AGE
SEVEN.
I'VE BEEN READING VAMPIRE
FOLKLORE SINCE I WAS A VERY
YOUNG CHILD.
I ALWAYS IMAGINED SORT OF THE
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO
DESIGNING MONSTERS.
SO I FIGURED OUT...
>> Stephen: THERE SHOULD BE A
GUIDE BOOK AND YOU CHECK IT OFF,
YOU GO ON SAFARI FOR MONSTER?
THAT WOULD BE FUN.
>> MENTALLY.
RAY IS A GREAT ANIMATOR AND
CREATOR OF MONSTERS.
HE USED TO SAY, YOU CANNOT
DESIGN A MONSTER UNLESS YOU
IMAGINE IT IN ITS OWN
ENVIRONMENT.
IF YOU JUST IMAGINE A MOVIE
MONSTER, THEY DON'T WORK, AS
WELL.
>> Stephen: SO YOU HAVE TO GET
THE HOMIE FEEL.
THIS IS ABOUT A SLAM PYRRHIC
VIRUS THAT STARTS TURNING PEOPLE
INTO VAMPIRES ALL OVER THE
WORLD.
THE VAMPIRES ARE ALL VYING FOR
WORLD DOMINATION.
HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO THIS
HAPPENING ON A SCALE OF VERY
LIKELY TO IT'S ALREADY UNDER
WAY?
>> I THINK IT'S ALREADY WITHIN
WITHIN -- BEEN COVERED UP.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR
PEOPLE TO BE SCARED OF.
>> I THINK THEY SHOULD BE.
>> Stephen: I'M HOLDING A
RALLY TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE.
COULD YOU GIVE ME ANY ADVICE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY ADVICE ON
THE USE OF FEAR?
>> WE CAN MAKE UP A VIRUS.
THAT'S PRETTY EFFECTIVE.
>> Stephen: SO I COULD INFECT
MY FANS WITH A VIRUS?
THAT SOUNDS TERRIFYING.
I HEAR IF YOU GO TO JON
STEWART'S RALLY, YOU TURN INTO A
VAMPIRE.
>> I TELL YOU, IT SOUNDED PRETTY
BAD.
>>
>> Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS TO BE MOST SCARED OF IS
IMMIGRANTS COMING FROM MEXICO.
CASE IN POINT RIGHT HERE.
HOW DID YOU GET HERE, BY THE
WAY?
WERE YOU AN ANCHOR BABY?
>> NO.
I WAS AN ANCHOR BY SHEER WEIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YOUR CATHOLICISM,
THE SORT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
HISPANIC CA CATHOLICISM IS
PARTICULARLY BLOODY AND GORY.
I WENT TO A HISPANIC CHURCH IN
CHICAGO WHEN I LIVED THERE, AND
THERE WAS JUST BLOOD AND GUTS
EVERYWHERE AND LIGHTBULBS A AS
PART OF THE STATUES.
>> BECAUSE YOU GOT THE LIGHT THE
EXIT ONES, YOU KNOW?
>> Stephen: YOU WANTED TO SEE
SATAN DEVOURING THE BABY.
>> THERE ARE COMPOUND FRACTURES.
I USED TO GO TO THE CHURCH AND
THERE WERE EXPOSED BONES AND
PURPOSELING SKIN.
IT WAS PRETTY...
>> IT'S NOT EVERY CULTURE WHERE
THEY BRING OUT THE SKULLS ON THE
HOLIDAYS.
>> NO, NO.
OR ST. LUCIE WITH THE EYES IN
THE LITTLE TRAY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
>> ST. LUCIE WITH HER EYES IN A
LITTLE TRAY.
THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY... IT
DIDN'T MAKE COMMUNION ANY MORE
APPETIZING, YOU KNOW?
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THE BODY
AND THE BLOOD OF CHRIST COULD
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THE BODY AND
THE BLOOD.
>> CHURCHES MEXICO COULD LEARN
FROM FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS AND
PUT BETTER PICTURES ON THE MENU.
IT WAS PRETTY...
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO GIVE
THE EUCHARIST MORE STREET
APPEAL?
WELL, GUILLERMO DEL TORO, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
