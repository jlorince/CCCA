HEY, MR. ENO THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> NOW SIR YOU ARE A
LEGENDARY ARTIST MUSICIAN,
PRODUCER, BACK IN THE 70s
YOU WERE IN ROCKSIE MUSIC
BUT YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON
ROCK SUPERSTARDOM, RIGHT.
>> YES.
>> DID YOU NOT.
>> YES, I DID.
>> WHY WOULD YOU WALK AWAY.
>> FROM ROCK SUPERSTARDOM,
HOT AND COLD RUNNING WOMEN.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
>> FUNLY ENOUGH THAT DIDN'T
STOP WHEN I WALKED AWAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> REALLY?
THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING
INTERVIEW.
>> NO, WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT
ONE NIGHT WE WERE PLAYING
SOME WHERE.
I HAD A BUFF TIME IN ROXY
MUSIC BY THE WAY.
BUT ONE NIGHT WE WERE
PLAYING AND I WAS SINGING.
I USED TO DO BACKING VOCALS
AS WELL AS PLAYING
SYNTHESIZER AND I FOUND
MYSELF THINKING ABOUT MY
LAUNDRY.
>> IN A CONCERT YOU WERE
THINKING ABOUT YOUR LAUNDRY.
>> YES.
>> THAT'S GREAT LAUNDRY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AN I THOUGHT MAYBE I'M
NOT IN THE RIGHT JOB HERE.
AND SO YOU WENT ON TO DO
PRODUCE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE,
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOT ONLY
PRODUCING MUSIC BUT YOU'RE
BACK TO DOING VISUAL ART AND
ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT YOU
HAVE GOT ONGOING VISUAL ART
PROJECT.
IT'S CALLED 77 MILLION
PAINTINGS.
>> YEAH.
>> OKAY.
LET'S SHOW AN EXAMPLE OF
WHAT THIS IS.
OKAY, THAT IS IT, THAT IS A
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VIDEO
SCREENS, CORRECT.
>> YES, SO THAT'S ABOUT 18
FEET HIGH, THAT.
>> OKAY.
>> THE WHOLE THING.
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT
THOSE SCREENS CHANGE VERY
SLOWLY BUT ALL THE TIME AND
THEY NEVER REPEAT, ACTUALLY.
SO YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE
SAME THING TWICE ON THEM.
>> EVEN, WHAT IF YOU WAITED
A LONG TIME.
>> WELL, IF YOU WAIT-- 77
MILLION PAINTINGS, HOW LONG
WOULD THAT TAKE.
>> THAT'S PER SCREEN SO IF
YOU WAITED ABOUT 400 MILLION
YEARS YOU MIGHT SEE THE
COMPLETE REPERTOIRE.
>> OKAY.
>> BUS IT'S NOT GUARANTEED.
>> SO IT'S LIKE THE ULTIMATE
SCREENSAVER.
>> YES.
>> AT ANY POINT DO FLYING
TOASTERS COME ACROSS OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
>> NOT YET.
>> WHY DO YOU LIKE THINGS
THAT TAKE A LONG TIME.
BECAUSE ARE YOU ALSO PART OF
A LONG NOW PROJECT.
>> YES.
>> WHICH IS A CHIME, RIGHT.
HOW LONG, IT'S A CLOCK,
RIGHT.
>> IT'S A CLOCK, A 10,000
YEAR CLOCK WHICH WE'RE
CURRENTLY BEING ONE
IN-- BUILDING ONE IN TEXAS.
I WENT TO SEE IT LAST WEEK,
ACTUALLY.
AND I SUPPOSE THE IDEA IS TO
TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT
MAKES PEOPLE THINK IN THE
VERY LONG TERM.
>> SO IT'S A CLOCK, IT'S
GOING TO RUN FOR 10,000
YEARS.
>> YES.
>> AND THAT'S A LOT OF
DURACELLS, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO RUN IT FOR 10,000 --
>> IT'S A BIG CLOCK.
IT'S ABOUT 500 FEET HIGH.
WE BUILT THE FIRST PART OF
THE SHAFT IN A MOUNTAIN IN
TEXAS AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER
MOUNTAIN IN NEVADA TO BUILD
THE SECOND.
>> DOES IT HAVE AN ALARM.
>> IT HAS A CHIME.
>> IT HAS A CHIME.
>> YEAH.
>> DID YOU WRITE THE CHIME.
>> YEAH.
>> CAN YOU SING IT FOR US.
>> NOT REALLY.
>> REALLY?
YOU DO A LOT OF CHIMES.
YOU'RE BIG IN THE CHIME
WORLD.
YOU COULD DO WINDOW'S 95
CHIMES.
>> I'M REALLY INTO CHIMES.
>> LITTLE SNIPPETS, DID YOU
DO THAT BY MENEN S THAT YOU?
>> NOT THAT ONE.
WINDOWS 95, IT WOULD BE HARD
TO REMEMBER IT TO YOU
BECAUSE I MADE 83 DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF IT.
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH
FINALLY GOT USED.
BUT IT WAS MY MOST POPULAR
PIECE OF MUSIC EVER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU DO THINGS WITH ART.
YOU PUT ART IN PLACES THAT
THEY WOULDN'T ORDINARILY GO.
LIKE YOU GOT THE IDEA,
WALKING THROUGH AN AIRPORT,
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN.
>> ACTUALLY I WAS SITTING IN
A LOVELY AIRPORT IN COLEOGNE
A NEW AIRPORT, EVERYTHING
WAS BEAUTIFUL, IT WAS A
LOVELY SUNNY MORNING, BUT
THE MUSIC WAS TERRIBLE.
SOMEBODY HAD PUT IN A MIX
TAPE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IT JUST DIDN'T FIT WITH THIS
WONDERFUL AIRPORT.
AND I STARTED THINKING WELL,
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC OUGHT TO
BE IN AN AIRPORT.
WHAT SHOULD WE BE HEARING
HERE.
AND I THOUGHT MOST OF ALL
YOU WANTED MUSIC THAT DIDN'T
TRY TO PRETEND THAT YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO DIE ON THE
PLANE.
I MEAN LET'S FACE FACTS.
>> ALL RIGHT.
I FACED THOSE LONG AGO.
>> NOW YOU TRY TO PUT ART IN
PLACES YOU SAY THAT ARE
VACANT OR PLACES WHERE THERE
ISN'T PRESENTLY ART.
>> YES, IN PLACES WHERE
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE LEAVING A
HOLE.
>> BUT IN AMERICA THERE ARE
NO EMPTY PLACES ANY MORE.
>> THAT'S VERY TRUE.
>> IT'S ALL F WE'RE NOT
THERE, IT'S FILLED WITH
ADVERTISEMENTS FOR US TO
SEE.
>> THERE IS A MOUNTAIN IN
TEXAS WE FOUND A HOLE.
>> YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO
BUREAU INTO THE EARTH TO
FIND SOMEPLACE WHERE THERE
WASN'T AN AD ALREADY?
>> AND THE MOLEMEN WERE DOWN
THERE AND THEY SAID DRINK
SPRITE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU SAY THAT SINGING CAN
KEEP YOU YOUNG AND SEXY.
>> UH-HUH.
>> CAN THAT WORK FOR ANYONE?
>> LOOK AT ME?
(LAUGHTER)
>> CAN I USE THAT.
>> I THINK SINGING IS REALLY
GOOD FOR YOU.
>> DO YOU HAVE A
RECOMMENDATION OF ANY SONGS.
>> DO YOU KNOW LEAN ON ME,
THAT SONG.
>> BILL WITHERS I KNOW THAT
SONG.
>> YEAH, THAT'S A VERY GOOD
SONG.
WE OFTEN-- I HAVE AN A
CAPELLA SING GROUP THAT
MEETS AT MY STUDIO EVERY
TUESDAY EVENING.
A COMPLETE LEER ASSORTED
BUNCH OF PEOPLE, VERY FEW
WHOM ARE MUSICIANS.
MOST ARE LAWYERS OR
TELEVISION PERSONALITIES.
>> SOUND LIKE WONDERFUL
PEOPLE.
>> WONDERFUL.
>> PLEASE COME BACK AND
WE'LL SING A SONG TOGETHER.
>> OKAY.
>> ALL RIGHT, BRIAN ENO,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> BRIAN ENO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
