TO ME.
MAY THE BEST STEPHEN COLBERT
WIN.
NATION, I DON'T USUALLY PAY
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN
ENGLAND.
I ASSUME IF SOMETHING REALLY
IMPORTANT HAPPENS OVER, THERE
I'LL FIND OUT ABOUT IT IN THE
NEXT HARRY POTTER MOVIE, WHICH
STRANGELY THERE HAS BEEN NO
MENTION IN THE LATEST TRAILER OF
MY FAVORITE
ANGELO-AUSTRALIAN-AMERICAN MEDIA
BILLIONAIRE MUGGLE, NEWS CORP
CHAIRPERSON AND FIVE-TIME DARK
LORD OF THE MONTH RUPERT
MURDOCH.
HE'S FACING A SPOT OF LEGAL
TROUBLE IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND
TOWN BECAUSE A TABLOID HE OWNED,
THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD," WELL,
THEY WENT AND DID A SILLY THING.
THEY ILLEGALLY HACKED INTO
PEOPLE'S CELL PHONE MESSAGES.
4,000 TIMES.
AND NOW POOR UNCLE RUPI IS
GETTING HIS CRUMPET STOPPED AND
FOR WHAT?
>> RUPERT MURDOCH SAID "NEWS OF
THE WORLD" TRIED TO HACK INTO
THE VOICE MAILS OF VICTIMS OF
THE 9/11 ATTACKS.
>> AS WELL AS THE VOICE MAILS OF
FAMILIES OF BRITISH SEGARS
KILLED IN ACTION.
>> THE PAPER HACKED INTO THE
VOICE MAIL OF 13-YEAR-OLD MILLIE
DOWLER WHILE SHE WAS STILL
MISSING AND THE HACKER EVEN
DELETED SOME VOICE MAILS, GIVING
HER FAMILY FALSE HOPE SHE WAS
STILL ALIVE.
>> Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE?
>> VICTIMS INCLUDED ACTRESS
SIENNA MILLER AND STAR HUGH
GRANT.
>> Stephen: OH, HUGH GRANT.
HE HASN'T HAD A MOVIE IN LIKE
TWO YEARS.
BUT JUST HOW BIG OF A SCANDAL IS
THIS?
>> AFTER 168 YEARS NOW, THE
"NEWS OF THE WORLD" HAS PUT ITS
LAST ISSUE TO BED.
THE TABLOID WAS SHUT DOWN THIS
PAST WEEK BY ITS OWNER, RUPERT
MURDOCH.
>> Stephen: SO BIG THAT A
PAPER GOING OUT OF BUSINESS IS
NEWS.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THE MEDIA SHARKS ARE
LICKING THEIR CHOPS, AND NOT
JUST BECAUSE RIEWP ERTD LOOKS
LIKE A DEAD SQUID.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK AT HOW GLEEFULLY THE
COMPETITION IS REPORTING THIS
STORY.
>> THE SCANDAL DEEPENS FOR
RUPERT MURDOCH AND HIS MEDIA
EMPIRE ROCKED BY SHAME.
>> I'M NOT REALLY HEARING A
RESPONSE FROM NEWS CORP, AND
THEY'RE USUALLY THE MOST
AGGRESSIVE.
YOU LOOK AT THEIR P.R. STAFF,
AND THEY'RE REMARKABLE.
>> THERE IS NO CONTAINING THE
SCANDAL.
>> THE SCANDAL.
>> ROCKED BY SCANDAL.
>> ANARCHY IN THE U.K., AS THE
SEX PISTOLS MIGHT HAVE SAID.
>> Stephen: AS CEE LO GREEN
MIGHT SAY, "[BLEEPED] YOU."
NOW, I WARNED RUPERT, THESE ARE
THE TYPE OF ATTACKS THAT HAPPEN
WHEN THERE ARE MEDIA COMPANIES
HE DOESN'T OWN.
NOW ALL THE OTHER MEDIA TYPES
ARE GANGING UP ON HIM.
THEY'RE ACCUSING MURDOCH'S
AMERICAN NEWS CHANNEL FOX OF NOT
COVERING THE STORY BECAUSE
DURING A COMMERCIAL BREAK FOX
NEWS ANALYSTS SAID IN FRONT OF A
WEB CAM THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
>> ANYBODY WANT TO BRING UP THE
SUBJECT THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT TODAY FOR THE STREAMERS?
>> GO AHEAD.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH IT.
>> Stephen: BIG DEAL.
THAT'S FOX NEWS MOTTO "WE DON'T
TOUCH IT.
YOU DECIDE."
NOW, "NEWS OF THE WORLD," NEWS
OF THE WORLD DIDN'T EVEN DO
ANYTHING WRONG.
JUST LISTEN TO ITS FORMER EDITOR
PAUL McMULLEN.
>> I TRIED TO WRITE ARTICLES IN
A TRUTHFUL WAY AND WHAT BETTER
SOURCE OF GETTING THE TRUTH IS
TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE'S MESSAGES.
>> Stephen: YES.
LAUGHTER LAUGH
THE SAME WAY THAT THE BEST WAY
FOR A DOCTOR TO GET YOUR MEDICAL
HISTORY IS TO STEAL YOUR KIDNEY.
[LAUGHTER]
SO FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE AND
TO GET TO THE TRUTH OF THIS
STORY, I HACKED THE MESSAGES
LEFT BY RUPERT MURDOCH ON HIS
ATTORNEY'S CELL PHONE THIS WEEK.
JIM.
>> HENRY, THIS IS RUPERT.
THIS THING'S GONE OUT OF
CONTROL.
I'M AUSTRALIAN FOR [BLEEPED].
CALL ME BACK AS FAST AS A
WALLABY UP A EUCALYPTUS TREE.
HENRY, RUPERT.
GODDAMNIT I HAD TO CLOSE THE
PAPER.
I'M ANGRIER THAN A BLOOMING
ONION.
WHEN I'M ANGRY I WANT TO BUY
STUFF.
SEE IF COLORADO IS AVAILABLE.
CALL ME.
BYE.
[BEEPING]
[BLEEPED]DED.
[BLEEPED] ON THE BARBIE.
I WANT TO BUY HUGH JACKMAN AND
MAKE HIM BREED WITH KYLIE
MINOGUE.
KOALA ME BACK.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: CRIKEY.
IT LOOKS LIKE HIS MEDIA EMPIRE
MIGHT GO DOWN THE TOILET NOW,
AND IN AUSTRALIA IT GOES DOWN
THE OTHER WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE YESTERDAY MURDOCH HAD TO
ABANDONED HIS 12 BILLION DOLLAR
BID TO BUY BRITISH SATELLITE
BROADCASTER B SKY B.
WE DON'T GET B SKY B HERE
BECAUSE THE BRITISH SATELLITES
DRIVE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE
ORBIT.
IT IS SO SAD, FOLKS.
WITH "NEWS OF THE WORLD" GONE
AND B SKY B OUT OF REACH, ALL
RUPERT HAS TO COMFORT HIM ARE
THESE FEW MEDIA PROPERTIES.
[LAUGHTER]
SEE, THAT'S ALL.
FROM NOW ON... OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL
