EVERYBODY.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
NATION, AS REGULAR VIEWERS MAY
KNOW, I AM AN AVID SPY
ENTHUSIAST.
I LOVE ALL THOSE TWISTY, TURNEY
NOVELS AND THOSE PERPLEXING
MISSING PERSON THRILLERS BY
MARTIN HANFORD.
SPOILER ALERT: NEXT TO THE
GIRAFFE.
THAT'S WHY, FOLKS, I AM SO
EXCITED ABOUT THE RELEASE OF THE
FIR-EVER AUTHORIZED HISTORY OF
MI6, WHICH IS LIKE THE C.I.A.
FOR BRITAIN, EXCEPT THEY
DESTABILIZE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS
WITH DRY WIT.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE SECRET
HISTORY OF MI6: 1909 TO 1949."
IT IS FULL OF INTERESTING TID
BITS FOR THE SPY NERD, LIKE
DEBATES OVER NAZI LEADERS, THEIR
EXPERIMENTS WITH EXPLODING
FILING CABINETS AND THE FACT
THAT DURING WORLD WAR I BRITISH
AGENTS USED SEMEN AS INVISIBLE
INK, BEGGING THE QUESTION: DO
THEY NOT HAVE LEMON JUICE IN
ENGLAND?
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, I ASSUME BRITISH AGENTS USE
THE TECHNIQUE TO WRITE NOTES
LIKE "THE HUNS HAVE DISCOVERED
MY POSITION.
I FEAR THEY HEARD ME WEST WANKING."
( LAUGHTER )
THE BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AGENT
WHO FIRST CHAMPIONED THIS METHOD
IN 1915 WAS NAMED, AND I AM NOT
MAKING THIS UP, SIR MANSFIELD
CUMMING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S THE GUY.
WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO WHAT HE
YELLED WHEN PRODUCING INVISIBLE
INK.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S HIM IN THE MONOCLE RIGHT
THERE.
EVIDENTLY HE WENT BLIND ONE EYE
AT A TIME.
BUT IN THE BOOK, FOLKS, IN THE
BOOK, ONE AGENT RECALLS THAT ALL
WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN SECRET
INK, WHICH CAME FROM A NATURAL
SOURCE OF SUPPLY.
AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
AGENTS WERE ANXIOUS FOR AN
EXCUSE TO RUB ONE OUT AT WORK.
BUT WHEN USING...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT WHEN USING THE INVISIBLE
SPINK, THE BRITISH DISCOVERED
THAT A FRESH OPERATION WAS
NECESSARY FOR EACH LETTER.
THEY ALSO DISCOVERED THEY LOVED
WRITING LETTERS.
AND KEEPING DIARIES, MAKING
SHOPPING LISTS AND PRINTING A
DAILY NEWSPAPER.
IT'S A FASCINATING BIT OF
HISTORY, FOLKS, BUT WHERE OTHERS
JUST SEE OLD D.N.A. ON A PIECE
OF PAPER, I SEE A MARKETING
OPPORTUNITY.
AND A NEW PRODUCT FROM MY LINE
OF PREMIUM MAN SEED, FORMULA
401.
THAT'S WHY FOR YOUR ESPIONAGE
PRINTING NEEDS, I AM PROUD TO
INTRODUCE, FORMULA FOR YOUR EYES
ONLY, INVISIBLE SPY INK.
IT COMES IN PRINTER CARTRIDGES
FULLY LOADED WITH BONER TONER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND IT IS A GODSEND FOR LADY
SPIES WHO CANNOT PRODUCE THEIR
OWN.
WARNING, LADIES, IF USED
INCORRECTLY, THE AGENCY WILL
DISAVOW ANY INFORMANTS WHO
APPEAR NINE MONTHS LATER.
FORMULA FOR YOUR EYES ONLY,
