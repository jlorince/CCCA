WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS
THE WATER BREAKS.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU
SHOULD NEVER LOOK A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH, BUT I SAY YOU
SHOULD NEVER REGISTER FOR A
HORSE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THAT
THING?
YOU'RE NEWLYWEDS.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FIRST UP, YOU'RE VERY KIND.
FIRST UP, BY NOW YOU ALL KNOW
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAS BEEN
ACQUITTED IN A HIGH-PROFILE CASE
STEEPED IN RACIAL TEDGES, WE IN
THE CABLE-FEAR KNEW THAT IF
ZIMMERMAN WALKED OUR CITIES
WOULD BURN.
>> FLORIDA PREPARING FOR RIOTS
IF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN IS ACQUITTED
OF MURDER.
>> THERE MAY BE RIOTS.
FLORIDA POLICE ARE PREPARING
FOR RIOTS.
>> I THINK WE'RE BEING FOOLISH
AND FRANKLY NAIVE TO THINK THAT
THERE MAY NOT BE RIOTS.
>> YES, TO THINK THERE MAY NOT
BE RIOTS IS FOOLISH AND NAIVE
AND WORST OF ALL, ACCURATE.
>> THINGS HAVE REMAINED CALM AND
PEACEFUL HERE IN SANFORD
FLORIDA.
>> CROWDS GATHERED IN NEWARK FOR
A PEACEFUL PROTEST.
>> THE PROTESTS ACROSS WERE
PEACEFUL LOUD BUT PEACE TELE.
>> A GROUP OF YOUNG
DEMONSTRATORS HAD ANY MOGUL
MOMENT AS THEY SANG QUIETLY ON
THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL
BUILDING IN TALLAHASSEE.
>> Stephen: SANG QUIETLY.
EXCUSE ME.
I ORDERED A RIOT.
ALL I GET IS A FOLK FESTIVAL.
STOP SINGING "IF I HAD A HAMMER"
AND START SWINGING ONE OF THEM
AROUND.
SO A WAG OF MY FINGER AT
NONRIOTING BLACK PEOPLE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
LISTEN, LISTEN.
YEAH, WE'RE ALL ANGRY.
YOU CANNOT SET THE BAR AT RODNEY
KING AND THEN GIVE ME THIS WEAK
[BLEEP].
YES, MAYBE IN LOS ANGELES THEY
SCARED IN DRIVERS AND IN OAKLAND
PROTESTORS VANDALIZED A MEN'S
WAREHOUSE STORE.
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WASN'T EVEN
ABOUT THE ACQUITTAL OF GEORGE
ZIMMERMAN.
THEY WERE MAD ABOUT THE RECENT
FIRING OF MEN'S WAREHOUSE
FOUNDER GEORGE ZIMMER.
BECAUSE UNLIKE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN,
HE DOES LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK.
SO THAT'S IT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S ALL I GET.
THAT'S IT?
I JUST GET THE BROKEN GLASS AND
AN OVERTURNED RACK OF SEPARATES.
HAVE WE FORGOTTEN RODNEY KING?
I MEAN THAT WAS A RIOT.
WHERE ARE THE BUILDINGS ON FIRE?
YOU'RE JUST NOT HOLDING UP YOUR
END OF WHAT WE SAID YOU WOULD
DO.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WAS ACQUITTED
BECAUSE A JURY UNDERSTOOD WHY HE
FELT THREATENED BY AN UNARMED
BLACK YOUTH.
AND WHY WOULDN'T HE FEEL THAT
WAY?
THEY RIOT.
BUT IF YOU DON'T RIOT, YOU SEEM
LESS THREATENING.
THEN ZIMMERMAN WILL SEEM LIKE A
BAD GUY.
AND THAT WOULD BE A TRAGIC
ENDING TO THIS STORY.
BECAUSE AS IT IS, HE'S GOING TO
HAVE TO LIVE HIS LIFE AS A
MARKED MAN AS HIS BROTHER ROBERT
SAID.
>> CLEARLY HE'S A FREE MAN IN
THE EYES OF THE COURT BUT HE'S
GOING TO BE LOOKING AROUND HIS
SHOULDER FOR THE REST OF HIS
LIFE.
>> Stephen: YES, HE'LL BE
LOOKING AROUND HIS SHOULDER.
CAN YOU IMAGINE FEELING LIKE
YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED.
EVERYONE JUST ASSUMING YOU'RE A
CRIMINAL.
I MEAN, IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD
WEAR SOMETHING TO HIDE MY FACE.
NEXT ON THE T-DUBS, A TIP OF THE
HAT TO FOX NEWS FOR BRINGING IN
SOME FRESH BLOOD AND NOT JUST
FOR RUPERT MURDOCH'S WINE
CELLAR.
JIM?
>> ELIZABETH HASSELBECK WILL BE
JOINING US VERY SHORTLY IN
SEPTEMBER TO BE ONE OF THE HOSTS
OF FOX AND FRIENDS.
SHE'LL BE COMING ON OVER TO THE
CURVY COUCH.
>> Stephen: ELIZABETH HASSELBECK
FROM THE VIEW WILL BE REPLACING
GRETCHEN CARLSON ON FOX AND
FRIENDS OR AS THE BROWN-HAIRED
GUY WHO IS NOT STEVE DOOCY PUTS
IT, "ARE YOU MY NEW WOMAN?"
THE GRETCH WHO SAVED CHRISTMAS
IS ABANDONING HER COUCH BUDDIES
TO TAKE OVER MEGYN KELLY'S SPOT
IN THE ARCH WHICH DISAPPOINTS ME
BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT THEY
WERE FOX AND FRIENDS BUT I GUESS
FOR GRETCHEN, IT WAS JUST FOX
AND BUSINESS.
MEANWHILE MEGYN KELLY'S MOVING
TO PRIME TIME RUMOR HAS IT
TAKING GRETA VAN SUSTERANT'S
TIME SLOT.
I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE FOOTAGE
OF THE FOX NEWS RESCHEDULING IN
PROGRESS.
SO, BRAVO.
BRAVO, FOX NEWS FOR BOLDLY
CHANGING THE FACE OF NEWS.
NOT THE THE HAIR.
JUST THE FACE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
