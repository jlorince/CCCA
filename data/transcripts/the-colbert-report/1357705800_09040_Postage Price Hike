[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, FOLKS.
I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME IN HERE, OUT THERE
NATION, WE ALL KNOW THE ECONOMY'S NOT IN GREAT SHAPE.
JUST TODAY THE DOW DROPPED FIFTY FIVE-- OF WHATEVER IT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DOW-LERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO I WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT ONE OF MY INVESTMENTS SKYROCKETED IN VALUE TODAY.
>> FOREVER IS GOING TO COST YOU MORE, AND BY FOREVER I MEAN UNITED STATES POST OFFICE'S
FOREVER STAMP.
COME JANUARY 27, IT GOES UP BY ONE CENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I DON'T WANNA BRAG BUT BACK IN 2007, I BOUGHT DOZENS OF FOREVER STAMPS WHEN
THEY WERE STILL 41 CENTS A POP.
NOW THEY'RE 46 CENTS.
GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH THAT'S WORTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVERY TIME I SEND A LETTER, THAT'S PURE PROFIT!
EVERY SECOND I'M NOT LICKIN', I'M LOSING MONEY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT AS SMART AN INVESTMENT AS THIS WAS, IT JUST PROVES THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.
THIS PRICE HIKE IS AN OUTRAGE.
A PENNY?!
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, POST OFFICE.
I PUT A LETTER LIKE THIS IN A METAL BOX ON ANY STREET CORNER IN, SAY, MIAMI AND WITHIN A
COUPLE DAYS IT'S DELIVERED IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.
AND FOR THAT YOU WANT 46 CENTS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU GO TO HELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT -- WHAT?
WHAT AM I, MADE OF CENTS?
WHAT'S NEXT? 47 CENTS?!
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT'S AFTER THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL SCREW THE POST OFFICE.
AT THIS PRICE, I'LL DELIVER MY OWN LETTERS, THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOTE TO SELF, CHECK ORBITZ FOR FLIGHTS TO EVERYWHERE.
