(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS?
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS?
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T ADMIT THIS
BUT HEARING YOU CHANT MY NAME
LIKE THAT IS... WELL, IT'S
SWEETER THAN MOTHER'S MILK TO
ME.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, THANK YOU.
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE HUGE
NEWS OUT OF ARIZONA, HERMAN CAIN
HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS
EVENING TO ADDRESS THE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT CHARGES FROM NUMEROUS
WOMEN COMING OUT OF THE
WOODWORK.
INCIDENTALLY, I BELIEVE HIS
WOODWORK COMING OUT IS ONE OF
THE THING HE'S ACCUSED OF.
THEY'VE ALL BEEN ANONYMOUS AND
THE LATEST ANONYMOUS WOMAN IS
SHARON BIALEK.
AND HER ACCUSATIONS ARE BOTH
GRAPHIC AND SPECIFIC BUT DON'T
TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE
I'VE TIVOED THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, CAIN'S PRESS CONFERENCE WAS
OPENED BY HIS LAWYER WHO MADE A
LENGTHY INTRODUCTION THEN
FINALLY CAIN TOOK THE PODIUM--
ADMITTEDLY WITHOUT ASKING THE
PODIUM WHETHER IT WANTED TO BE
TAKEN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
JIM?
>> THE CHARGES AND THE
ACCUSATIONS I ABSOLUTELY REJECT.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS A VERY
SERIOUS CHARGE.
>> Stephen: YES, VERY SERIOUS
CHARGE.
THAT HE TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY LAST
NIGHT WITH MY FRIEND JIMMY
KIMMEL WHO ASKED HIM ABOUT
BIALEK'S LAWYER GLORIA ALLRED.
>> HAVE YOU CONSIDERED HIRING
GLORIA ALLRED AS YOUR ATTORNEY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU ALMOST MADE ME SAY
SOMETHING THAT MY HANDLERS SAY
YOU SHOULD NOT SAY.
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THINK WAY,
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT I
WOULD HIRE HER TO DO, OKAY?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: (LAUGHS)
AND THAT LOOK SAYS HE KNOWS HOW
MANY THINGS FOR WOMEN TO DO.
AND IF HE'D HIRED THEM DO IT,
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS
TROUBLE.
THE POINT IS CAIN WAS GREAT WITH
JIMMY.
AS FOX NEWS'S WEB SITE DECLARED,
CAIN HIT HOME RUN ON KIM NELL--
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE HE
WAS ONLY TRYING TO GET TO THIRD
BASE.
NOW NONE OF THIS... FOLKS, I'M
TELLING YOU, NONE OF THIS IS
GOING TO STOP MY MAN HERMANN AND
HERE IS WHY.
>> THE DAY OF THE FIRESTORM OF
THESE ACCUSATIONS WE HADED
HIGHEST FUND-RAISING DAY ONLINE
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS CAMPAIGN
AND IT HAS NOT STOPPED.
>> Stephen: YES, AND IT IS NOT
STOPPING TONIGHT!
I AM WRITING A PERSONAL CHECK TO
HERMAN CAIN RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO WRITE A
CANDIDATE?
$2,500?
(BLEEP) THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
I AM GOING WITH
$10,000!
ALL RIGHT.
COME FOR ME, COPPERS.
BECAUSE HERMANN IS THE MAN.
NOW, HOW BAD COULD THESE NEW
CHARGES BE?
>> HE PUT HIS HAND ON MY LEG,
UNDER MY SKIRT AND REACHED FOR
MY GENITALS.
HE ALSO GRABBED MY HEAD AND
BROUGHT IT TOWARDS HIS CROTCH.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT'S TIME FOR THE
SPORT REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY SPORTS
STORIES I JUST WANT TO PUT SPACE
BETWEEN ME AND THOSE WORDS AND
THAT'S THE LONGEST GRAPHIC
OPENING THAT WE HAVE.
(LAUGHTER)
