[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US, EVERYBODY.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
OH, THAT'S NICE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
YOU KNOW, ONCE THESE PEOPLE...
ONCE THESE PEOPLE START CHANTING
MY NAME, YOU CAN'T STOP THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO
EVERYBODY WATCHING IN AMERICA,
ESPECIALLY TO OUR VIEWERS IN
ITALY.
WELCOME.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUENOS AIRES.
FOLKS, TONIGHT AMERICA SITS
HELPLESSLY BY WHILE WE INCH
CLOSER TO A CATASTROPHE.
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
DEBT CEILING.
SOMEONE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HELL STORM
ABOUT TO HIT LOS ANGELES, THE
LIKES OF WHICH NO LIVING HUMAN
HAS EVER SEEN.
NOW, I WANT TO WARN MY VIEWERS
THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS SO
HORRIFYING THAT IF THERE ARE ANY
BEST FEEDING MOTHER'S WATCHING,
YOUR MILK MAY CURDLE IN THE EAT
THE.
READY?
BRACE YOURSELF.
THIS WEEKEND IN LOS ANGELES, A
SHORT STRETCH OF THE 405 FREEWAY
WILL BE CLOSED FOR REPAIR.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
WE PRAYED THIS DAY WOULD NEVER
COME.
LUCKILY THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN A
VOICE OF CALM.
>> THE MOST TRAVELED HIGHWAY IN
AMERICA, THE MOST, THE 405 IN
L.A., IS ABOUT TO SHUT DOWN FOR
AN ENTIRE WEEKEND.
>> THEY'RE PREDICTING GRIDLOCK
ON STEROIDS.
>> BACK-UPS THAT COULD REACH THE
MEXICAN BORDER.
>> STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE
405.
>> THEY'RE CALLING IT
CARMAGEDDON.
>> CARMAGEDDON IS COMING.
>> CARMAGEDDON OR THE
CARPOCAPALYPSE.
>> THE CARMEN MIRANDETH.
NOW SURE, CALIFORNIANS HAVE
SURVIVED EARTHQUAKE, DROUGHT,
WILDFIRE, LAKER VICTORIES, EVEN
ALIEN INVASIONS, BUT THIS IS THE
BIG ONE, FOLKS.
INCREASED TRAFFIC ON TWO
OFF-PEAK DAYS.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE TO WALK
SOMEPLACE.
[LAUGHTER]
THINK OF THE CHILDREN.
