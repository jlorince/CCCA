>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

WE HAVE OTHER NEWS TO TALK ABOUT HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
NATION, TODAY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY WRAPS UP HIS HISTORIC
VACATION TO ENGLAND, ISRAEL AND POLAND, AND I'M SURE HE'S GLAD TO FINALLY BE COMING BACK HOLMES.
OF COURSE THE LIBERAL MEDIA HAS BEEN HAMMERING MITT THROUGHOUT THE TRIP FOR A COUPLE OF
HICCUPS, LIKE WHEN HE OFFENDED PALESTINIANS BY SUGGESTING THEY AREN'T PROSPEROUS BECAUSE OF
THEIR CULTURE AND OFFENDED THE ENGLISH WHEN HE QUESTIONED WHETHER LONDON WAS READY FOR THE OLYMPICS.
WHY IS THAT CONTROVERSIAL?
EVERY WEEK HANK WILLIAMS, JR.,
QUESTIONED IF AMERICANS WERE READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL.
COME ON.
DOUBLE STANDARDS.
WELL, TODAY IN POLAND, FOLKS,
ROMNEY'S PRESS SECRETARY RICK GORKA PUSHED BACK AT THE INFO JACKALS.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY, DO YOU FEEL YOUR GAFFES HAVE OVERSHADOWED YOUR FOREIGN TRIP?
>> SHOW SOME RESPECTING.
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD ANOTHER CHANCE TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS.
>> THIS IS FOR THE POLISH PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YES, SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR THIS MAN'S ASS,
WHICH IS APPARENTLY A HOLY SITE FOR THE POLISH PEOPLE.
SO ALL IN ALL A SUCCESSFUL TRIP.
BEST OF ALL, ROMNEY HAS CHECKED THREE COUNTRIES OF THE LIST OF 1,000 PLACES TO OFFEND PEOPLE
BEFORE YOU DIE.
I KNOW I'VE
