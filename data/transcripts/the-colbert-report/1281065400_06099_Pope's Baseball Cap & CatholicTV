[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
EMCEE STEVIE BREAKING THE SOUND NICE AND EASY IN NEW YORK CITY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M SORRY IF I JUST ALIENATED SOME OF MY OLDER VIEWERS, BUT I GOT TO BE WHO I GOTTA BE, AND
WHO I BE IS A STRONG CATHOLIC BROTHER, THE FATHER, SON AND THE HOLY G, KIND OF LIKE MY POSSE.
AND I'M TAKING MY STYLE CUES FROM NONE OTHER THAN THE NOTORIOUS P-O-P-E.
HE'S GOT A WHOLE NEW LOOK.
CHECK IT.
THAT HAT IS SO STREET AND THE BLING.
HE'S LIKE THE THE FLAVA FLAV.
AND THE CAP IS A WAY BETTER LOOK THAN WHEN HE WORE THE MITRE SIDEWAYS.
SWEET.
IT'S SO NICE.
IT IS SO NICE TO SEE MY CHURCH LEAVING ITS RECENT PROBLEMS BEHIND AND REACHING OUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE.
THIS TIME IN PUBLIC.
YOU SEE, THE CHURCH... THE CHURCH IS BUILDING ON THE MOMENTUM OF THE NEW POPE CAP
WITH ADDITIONAL YOUTH OUTREACH STRATEGY, INCLUDING WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE FUTURE OF
CATHOLIC ENTERTAINMENT.
JIM?
>> MY FATHER HAS THESE 3-D GLASSES.
WHOA, CATHOLIC TV IN 3-D.
ENJOY THE SHOW.
>> Stephen: WHOA!
CATHOLIC TV IN 3-D.
THAT IS OFF THE CROOK.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, PADRE, I AM READY TO BLAST OFF INTO A WORLD OF IN-YOUR-FACE, DOGMATICALLY SOUND AWESOMENESS.
>> THANKS FOR JOINING ME TO PRAY THE GLORIOUS MYSTERIES OF THE
HOLEY ROSARY, THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY.
>> Stephen: WHOA, IT'S LIKE THE GUILT IS COMING RIGHT AT ME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO HEATHENS AND THE EXCOMMUNICATED.
CATHOLIC TV IS A BOSTON-BASED INTERNET VIDEO SITE WITH PROGRAMING TAILOR MADE FOR THE
FAITHFUL, WHOSE GRANDCHILDREN TAUGHT THEM HOW THE BRUCE THE INTERNET.
PRESIDENT ROBERT REED HOPES THAT ADDING 3-D TO CATHOLIC TV WILL
CHANGE THE CHURCH'S STUFFY IMAGE AS HE TOLD ABC NEWS, "IT'S JUST
A HOT TECHNOLOGY, SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T USE
IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONNECTING WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE."
>> 3-D IS A HUGE HIT IN ACTION MOVIES AND A BONUS, CATHOLIC TV
IS LESS PREACHY THAN "AVATAR."
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, CATHOLIC TV HAS ALL OF THEIR PROGRAMING, FROM THEIR MORNING SHOW, "THIS IS THE DAY,"
TO THEIR LATE-NIGHT VARIETY SHOW, "GOING MY WAY WITH FATHER
CHRIS HICKEY," IT'S LIKE A 3-D LETTERMAN, EXCEPT THE TOP TEN LIST IS THE SAME EVERY DAY.
JIMMY.
LET'S GIVE 'EM TASTE.
>> HEY, LISTEN, SIMPLE ONE.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GO TO THE MOVIES MUCH, BUT THE ONE THAT I LIKE IS "ALIENS,"
>> SIGOURNEY WEAVER, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, WITH ALL THIS STUFF.
>> Stephen: THEN THEY LAUNCHED INTO A HEATED DEBATE OVER WHERE PARASITIC ALIEN LIFE BEGINS AT
FACE HUGGING OR ERUPTING FROM THE STOMACH.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, CATHOLIC TV.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IN FACT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO EXPAND YOUR ARSENAL OF YOUTH-ORIENTED GIMMICKS.
MIGHT I RECOMMEND A SCRATCH AND SNIFF BIBLE.
