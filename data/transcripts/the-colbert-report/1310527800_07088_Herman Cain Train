[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: VERY NICE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU FOR IS JOINING US.
THAT IS THE PURE UNCUT STUFF YOU
JUST GAVE ME.
I WISH I COULD COOK YOU PEOPLE
UP IN A SPOON.
FOLKS, WE ARE ONLY 16 MONTHS
AWAY FROM THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.
I'M AS EXCITED AS A KID ON THE
483RD NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT'S GOT ME JAZZED IS THAT
THE REPUBLICAN FIELD IS BRIMMING
WITH SUPERSTARS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL DECIDE
BETWEEN THE TEN OF THEM.
IT'S LIKE AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT
YOU GOT WHITE BREAD,
WHITE RICE,
CREAM OF WHEAT,
POTATOES,
MASH POTATOES,
BOILED POTATOES,
POTATO FLAKES,
MAYONNAISE,
PACKING PEANUTS,
AND FOR DESSERT:  HERMAN CAIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT WAS TASTY.
JIMMY, GIVE ME SOME MORE OF THAT
SWEET CANDY CAIN.
♪ ♪
HE'S A TRUE SON OF THE SOUTH
BORN AND RAISED THE AMERICAN WAY
♪ HIS DAD WAS A FARMER WITH
CLOTHES ON HIS BACK BUT HE
RAISED SOME CAIN AND NEVER
LOOKED BACK HERMAN CAIN ♪
OH, HERMAN CAIN ♪
GET ABOARD THE HERMAN CAIN TRAIN
>> Stephen: WOOH!
I AM ON BOARD THE HERMAN CAIN
TRAIN!
THE MAIN CAIN TRAIN!
PARTLY BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, I'M
NAMES.
AND I AM INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE
FOR HERMAN CAIN.
HE'S HOTTER THAN PROPANE.
THOUGH, HE SHOULD USE SOME
ROGAINE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S HERMAN FOR SURE-MAN.
HE DRINKS TEQUILA, AND LEAVES
THE WORM IN.
[LAUGHTER]
THE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE
SQUIRMIN'.
I'VE DETERMINED HE'S NOT GERMAN.
PLUS THE OTHER REASON I LIKE HIM
IS
YOU KNOW CAIN IS FISCALLY
CONSERVATIVE, BECAUSE THAT VIDEO
COULD NOT HAVE COST MORE THAN
$12.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S MY MAN.
THAT'S THE GUY!
AND I'M MOSTLY EXCITED BECAUSE
CAIN IS GOING TO BE MY GUEST ON
THURSDAY, JULY 28TH.
WRITE THAT ON YOUR iPAD IN INK!
[LAUGHTER]
HE WILL NOT ONLY BE SITTING DOWN
WITH ME BUT WITH THE HEAD OF
COLBERT SUPER PAC.
AND THAT GUY IS LOOKING TO
ENDORSE SOMEBODY.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, BEFORE I ENDOSED HIM,
CAIN WOULD HAVE TO SIGN THIS--
MY CANDIDATE'S PLEDGE-- FIRST.
IT'S BLANK RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT
IS.
I WOULD GET HIM TO SIGN A BLANK
PIECE OF PAPER AND IT WILL BE
SOMETHING GOOD, AMERICA AND
STUFF LIKE THAT.
BUT I'VE GOT TO GET ONE BECAUSE
EVERYONE WHO'S ANYONE IN
REPUBLICAN CIRCLES HAS ONE.
GROVER NOR QUIST HAS AN ANTITAX
PLEDGE.
