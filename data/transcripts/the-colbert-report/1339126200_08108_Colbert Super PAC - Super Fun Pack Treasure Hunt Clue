>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
BUT BEFORE WE G I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY WHO BOUGHT MY COLBERT SUPER PAC
SUPERFUN PACT THAT THE HIDDEN TREASURE HAS STILL NOT BEEN FOUND.
THAT MEANS IF YOU CAN SOLVE THE PUZZLE ON THE TREASURE MAP YOU CAN STILL CLAIM THE
PRIZE OF A PERSONAL APPEARANCE BY ME, YOUR SCHOOL AND AN ANTIQUE SILVER TURTLE BELL.
IT'S ONE OF A KIND, AT LEAST UNTIL YOUR SUPER PAC MONEY STARTS ROLLING IN AND YOU
ARE BALLS DEEP IN ANTIQUE SILVER TURTLE BELLS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK NEWT GINGRICH WAS DWOING THAT CREDIT LINE AT TIFFANIES?
NOW TO GIVE YOUR SEARCH A LITTLE BOOST RIGHT AFTER THE SHOW TONIGHT I'M SENDING OUT
AN EXTRA HINT, VIA E-MAIL TO EVERY ONE WHO REGISTERED FOR THE TREASURE HUNT.
SO CHECK YOUR IN-BOXES FOR AN E-MAIL WITH THE SUBJECT LINE CHEAP CANADIAN VIAGRA
MAKE GIRLS GO WILD, NOT SPAM,
WHICH I WILL KEEP USING UNTIL THE SEC RULES ON WHETHER SUPER PAC CAN SELL IMPORTED BONER PILLS.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD HUNTING,
