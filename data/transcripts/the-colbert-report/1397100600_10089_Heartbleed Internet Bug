I'M JUST DESPERATELY TRYINGTO SECURE MY DATA, FOLKS,
YOU SEE, LIKE YOU.
I'M IN A DEEP PANIC BECAUSEWE ARE FACING THE GREATEST
SECURITY BRIEF IN INTERNETHISTORY.
>> A MAJOR SECURITY THREATMAKING LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO
USE THE INTERNET A NEW BUGAFFECTING TWO-THIRDS OF ALL
MAJOR WEB SITES.
AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO STEALTHEIR PERSONAL DATA, CALLED
HEART BLEED.
>> IT WAS UNDISCOVERED FORMORE THAN TWO YEARS AND
ANYTHING SENT DURING THATTIME HAS POTENTIALLY BEEN
COMPROMISED DURING THAT TIME.
>> YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS NOTCOMPROMISED UNLESS YOU'RE
ONE OF THOSE TECHIES WHO USETHE INTERNET IN THE LAST TWO
YEARS.
>> SO YOU ARE TOTALLY SAYINGTED KACZYNSKI AND OLD
JAPANESE HER HIT LIVING IN AJUNGLE THINKING WORLD WAR II
IS STILL GOING ON.
YOU SEE, THE BUG, HEARTBLEED POTENTIALLY EXPOSES
PASSWORDS, CREDIT-CARDNUMBERS AND THE CONTENTS OF
YOUR E-MAILS.
CALL ME NAIVE BUT I THOUGHTTHAT WAS THE KIND OF PRIVATE
INFORMATION THAT WAS BETWEENME AND THE NSA.
FOLKS, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.
THE INTERNET WAS SUPPOSED TOBE A LAWLESS FRONTIER WHERE
ALL OF HUMANNITIES DESIRESAN VICES PERJURIED INTO A
ROYALLY COLLECTED ID HELD INCHECK BY A BARELY REGULATED
TECHNICAL ABSTRACTIONS IDON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW DID THAT GET OUT OFCONTROL?
AND WE'RE ALL POTENTIALVICTIMS HERE.
I COULD HAVE BEEN SCAMMED BYANY ONE OF MY MOST TRUSTED
SITES.
REAL GULL BARRIAN IVORY.COM.
NONDESCRIPT POWDER.ORG EVENPURE SILVER MORTGAGE
TEAM.HAITI.BIZ OR THE SITEWHERE I FOUND ALL THOSE,
YAHOO! MAIL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NATION, YOU CAN STILL
PROTECTION YOUR-- PROTECTYOURSELFS FROM HEART BLEED
WITH THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK.
>> SECURITY EXPERTS SAYINTERNET USERS SHOULD CHANGE
ALL OF THEIR PASSWORDS.
>> OH, ALREADY ON IT.
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG BUT MYSECURITY GUY E-MAILED ME AS
SOON AS THIS BROKE.
NOT ONLY IS HE A TECH EXPERTHE'S ALSO THE RIGHTFUL HEIR
TO A OIL FORTUNE.
TOLD ME I NEEDED AN EXTRASECURE PASSWORD.
HE SUGGESTED THE FIRST 16DIGITS OF MY CREDIT CARD
FOLLOWED BY THE LAST NINEDIGITS OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER.
THERE YOU GO.
AND NOW TO DOUBLE THEENCRYPTION BY A TACHING A
HIGH RESOLUTION SCAN OF MYSIGNATURE, AND THE OUTLINE
