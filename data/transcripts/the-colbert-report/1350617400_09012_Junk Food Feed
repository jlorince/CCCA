SOME LEGS AN BACKS.
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THESE DAYS, GOING TO
BE EXCITING.
GOING TO BE EXCITING.
GET USED TO IT THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE WE MAKE
EVERYTHING OUT OF CORN.
FROM CAR TIRES, DRYWALL, TO
KNIVES AND FORKS TO, AND I
AM NOT MAKING THIS UP,
POPCORN.
WE REALLY ARE LIVING IN THE
FUTURE.
WHERE'S MY JET PACK?
NOW UNFORTUNATELY, THIS
YEAR'S CRIPPLING DROUGHT HAS
DRIVEN CORN PRICES THROUGH
THE ROOF.
FROM 3.25 A BUSHEL THREE
YEARS AGO TO 7:35 A BUSHEL
TODAY.
7:35 A BUSHEL.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
MUCH THAT IS?
BECAUSE I DON'T.
WHAT'S A BUSHEL?
I THOUGHT A BUSHEL WAS A
GROUP OF DECEMBER.
AND NOW, FOLKS, THIS
SHORTAGE IS FORCING AMERICAN
CATTLE FARMERS TO THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX THEY PACK
THEIR COWS IN.
JIM?
>> AT MAYFIELD UNITED
LIVESTOCK COMMODITIES OWNER
JOSEPH WATSON IS TWEAKING
THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS.
HIS 1400 CATTLE ARE NO
LONGER FEEDING OFF CORN.
THE PRICE HE SAID ARE TOO
HIGH TO KEEP IN STOCK.
SO EARLIER THIS YEAR HE
BEGAN TO BUY SECONDHAND
CANDY.
>> IT HAS A HIGHER RATIO OF
FATS AND ACTUALLY FEEDING
STRAIGHT CORN.
>> Stephen: YES, THIS CATTLE
FARMER IS NOW A JOLLY
RANCHER.
AND FOLKS, I SAY-- I SAY IT
IS HIGH TIME-- IT IS HIGH
TIME WE STARTED FEEDING OUR
COWS CANDY.
I MEAN THE MEXICANS HAVE
BEEN STUFFING THEIR DONKEYS
FULL OF SWEETS FOR YEARS.
NOW NATION, WE HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN TOLD WE ARE WHAT WE
EAT.
BUT NOW WE CAN EAT WHAT EATS
WHAT WE EAT.
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.
BEST OF ALL--
(APPLAUSE)
BEST OF ALL EVEN THOUGH THIS
FARMER IS GIVING HIS COWS
CANDY, HE STILL TECHNICALLY
IS FEEDING THEM CORN.
BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF IT IS
MADE FROM HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN
SYRUP WHICH THANKS TO
GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES IS
SOMEHOW CHEAPER THAN THE
CORN IT IS MADE FROM.
WHAT DELICIOUS IRONY.
DELICIOUS, BE
