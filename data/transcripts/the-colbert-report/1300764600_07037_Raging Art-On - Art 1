FOLKS, LAST TIME TONIGHT'S GUEST
STEVE MARTIN WAS HERE WE HAD A
DISCUSSION OF FINE ARTS THAT WAS
SO RIVETING, MANY ART HISTORIANS
MOMENTARILY FELT THEIR LIVES HAD
MEANING.
AND THAT NIGHT I HAD FAMOUS
ARTISTS ALTER MY PORTRAIT.
SHEPARD FAIREY SPRAY-PAINTED IT,
ANDRES SERRANO SIGNED IT, AND
FATHER OF MINIMALISM FRANK
STELLA LOOKED AT IT.
NOW THAT I HAD AN IMPORTANT WORK
OF ART I DECIDED TO AUCTION IT
AND GIVE THE PROCEEDS TO
DONORSCHOOSE.ORG TO BENEFIT
ARTS EDUCATION IN PUBLIC
SCHOOLS.
AND THAT MONEY IS SORELY
NEEDED.
SOME OF THOSE KIDS HAVE TO BUY
THEIR OWN MARKERS TO DEFACE
SCHOOL PROPERTY.
(LAUGHTER)
SO TONIGHT MY AESTHETIC ODYSSEY
CONTINUES IN...
>> STEPHEN COLBERT'S RAGING
ART-ON, SALE OF THE CENTURY.
(APPLAUSE)
>> I TRAVELED TO THE PHILLIPS DE
PURY GALLERY TO CHECK OUT THEIR
"UNDER THE INFLUENCE" SHOW,
FEATURING MY PORTRAIT.
AND I SAT DOWN WITH THE MAN WHO
WOULD FIND MY BABY A HOME.
YOU ARE SIMONE DE PURY, CHAIRMAN
AND AUCTIONEER OF PHILLIPS DE
PURY GALLERY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: CAN I CALL YOU PHIL,
PHIL?
YOU HAVE NAMED THIS AUCTION
"UNDER THE INFLUENCE."
IS IT A REQUIREMENT OR JUST A
SUGGESTION THAT YOU BE HAMMERED
TO APPRECIATE THESE WORKS OF
ART?
DOES IT HELP TO BE DRUNK?
>> NO, IT DOESN'T.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU DRUNK RIGHT
NOW?
>> I AM NOT DRUNK NOW.
>> Stephen: FOR AN AMERICAN YOUR
ACCENT SOUNDS DRUNK.
>> YES, MAYBE SO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
DE PURY: IS THAT A FRENCH NAME?
SOUNDS FRENCH.
>> IT'S A SWISS NAME.
>> Stephen: AS A SWISS
ARISTOCRAT, WHY GO INTO THE ART
WORLD?
HAS THE NAZI GOLD RUN OUT?
>> I GREW UP IN BASEL, A
LITTLE CITY ON THE RHINE, AND
WHILE IT'S A VERY SMALL CITY,
IT'S VERY OPEN TO CONTEMPORARY
ART.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN AUCTIONING?
>> I HAVE BEEN AUCTIONING FOR 40
YEARS.
>> I CAN'T, I LOVE IT, IT'S
MUSIC.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY MUSIC AND
THAT IS WHY I ALSO LOVE HIP-HOP
AND RAP BECAUSE IT'S LIKE...
>> Stephen: THE WHAT?
>> YOU KNOW, RAPPING AND HIP-HOP
MUSIC.
>> Stephen: RAP MUSIC.
>> RAP MUSIC.
>> Stephen: IS HIP-HOP ART?
>> DEFINITELY ART, HIGH ART.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR
FAVORITE RAP SONG?
>> I CAN TELL YOU WHO MY
FAVORITE RAP ARTIST IS.
IT'S SNOOPY DOG, SNOOP DOG.
SNOOP DOG IS A GREAT, GREAT
ARTIST AND AN INCREDIBLE
SURVIVOR.
>> Stephen: YOU EVER BURN ONE
WITH SNOOP?
>> I DID NOT BURN ONE.
>> Stephen: I WILL HOOK YOU UP,
MAN.
SNOOP'S A FRIEND.
HOW CAN YOU TELL IF ANYTHING IS
EUROPEAN OR IS JUST GAY?
BECAUSE FOR AMERICANS, EUROPEAN
AND GAY IS A VERY FINE LINE.
WE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE
OFTEN.
>> WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
>> Stephen: I KNOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER.
LISTEN, SOME OF MY FAVORITE
PAINTINGS ARE GAY.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT
IS IMPORTANT IS THE QUALITY OF A
WORK.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU FOUND THE
LID TO THE ART WORLD?
>> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
BY THE LID.
>> Stephen: I MEAN, THE LID THAT
MY PORTRAIT BLEW OFF THE ART
WORLD, OKAY?
JUST [BLEEP] BLEW THAT THING
OFF WHEN THIS THING HIT THE
SCENE.
HAVE YOU FOUND THE LID?
>> IT CERTAINLY DID GET MASSIVE
REACTION.
>> Stephen: IT SURE DID.
>> SO...
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY VALUE
TO THAT?
IS THERE ANY VALUE TO THE FACT
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR ART?
BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT ANY OLD
PIECE OF, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
CRAP ON A WALL AND PEOPLE TALK
ABOUT IT, AND SUDDENLY IT IS
IMBUED WITH IMPORTANCE BECAUSE
IT BECOMES PART OF THE CULTURAL
MILIEU.
KEEP IN MIND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE WORD MILIEU MEANS.
>> IT CERTAINLY IS AN IMPORTANT
ELEMENT WHEN A WORK IS TALKED
ABOUT A LOT.
IF THE ARTIST IS TALKED ABOUT A
LOT, IT CLEARLY HELPS.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID YOU GOT
YOUR FIRST ERECTION TO A
RENOIR.
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Stephen: TAKE A LOOK AT MY
PORTRAIT, OKAY?
PHIL?
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?
>> I'M AFRAID IT HAS CLEARLY NOT
CAUSED THE SAME REACTION I HAD
WHEN I LOOKED AT SOME OF
RENOIR'S PAINTINGS WAY, WAY
BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOTHING?
>> LISTEN, I MAY FEEL OTHER
THINGS.
>> Stephen: TELL ME WHAT YOU
FEEL.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK, GET INTO THIS
RIGHT NOW.
>> IT IS A WORK WITH GREAT WALL
POWER.
>> Stephen: WALL POWER?
>> WALL POWER.
IT LEAPS AT YOU, YOU HAVE A
SELF-PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST.
YOU SEE HIM SIX TIMES.
>> Stephen: SO IT IS PROBABLY
GOING TO BE WORTH SIX TIMES WHAT
A SINGLE SELF-PORTRAIT WOULD BE
WORTH.
>> SO THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT
IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY WORTH.
>> Stephen: SIX TIMES WHAT A
NORMAL PORTRAIT WOULD BE WORTH.
THAT'S JUST MATH.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S CHECK OUT SOME OF MY
COMPETITION.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: LET'S DO IT.
THE AUCTION WOULD FEATURE ALMOST
200 PIECES.
MY PORTRAIT: LOT NUMBER ONE.
OBVIOUSLY THE BEST.
BUT IT PAYS TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
UP AGAINST.
CAN I GET ANY OF THIS STUFF IN
DIFFERENT COLORS?
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
>> A WORK BY DAMIEN HIRST.
>> Stephen: HE'S FAMOUS.
>> HE IS WORLD FAMOUS.
A SPIN ART.
>> Stephen: THIS IS SPIN ART.
AT WHAT POINT IN AN ARTIST'S
CAREER CAN THEY JUST START
PHONING IT IN?
OKAY, UNTITLED BIRD [BLEEP].
THIS IS LITERALLY CALLED BIRD
[BLEEP].
>> YES, IT IS CALLED LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: HOW I DO KNOW IT'S
NOT BIRD [BLEEP]?
>> BY LOOKING CLOSE UP AT IT,
YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY REALIZE
THAT THIS IS PAINT AND NOT
ACTUAL BIRD [BLEEP].
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
>> Stephen: I GOT TO SAY, I GET
THIS ONE.
I DON'T ALWAYS GET ART, BUT I
GET THIS ONE BECAUSE I LOOK AT
THIS AND I GO "THAT LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE BIRD [BLEEP]."
I MEAN, EXACTLY LIKE BIRD
[BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS FANTASTIC.
IS SHE AN AMERICAN ARTIST?
>> SHE IS A SWISS ARTIST.
>> Stephen: OH, SO CLOSE, SO
CLOSE.
CLEARLY WHAT WILEY IS DOING
WITH THIS PIECE IS COLLAPSING
HISTORY ON TOP OF STYLE INTO A
SINGULAR VISUAL IDENTITY.
THE BAROQUE PLAYING OFF OF
ROCOCO WHILE CAPTURING AN URBAN
VISION WITH A RENAISSANCE TOUCH,
THAT IS WHAT I THINK, I DON'T
KNOW.
YOU MAY THINK DIFFERENTLY.
>> YOU MAY HAVE READ THIS IN OUR
CATALOG.
>> Stephen: NO.
>> THIS IS CALLED POWERLESS
STRUCTURES.
>> Stephen: BEFORE I BID ON IT,
CAN I TRY THOSE ON?
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY
FIT.
I GENERALLY SPEAKING GET TO TRY
THE JEANS ON BEFORE YOU WALK OUT
OF THE STORE.
THIS ONE CAUGHT MY EYE.
WHO IS THIS BY?
>> THIS IS BY SIEN.
>> Stephen: AND WHAT GRADE IS HE
IN?
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'M
GETTING A SLIGHTLY PHALLIC FEEL
OFF OF THIS ONE.
AM I OFF BASE?
>> NO, I DON'T THINK YOU ARE OFF
BASE, NO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS ONE?
>> I THINK I MIGHT UNDERSTAND
IT.
>> Stephen: HOW WELL DO YOU
UNDERSTAND THIS ONE?
>> I THINK, YOU SEE, WHEN YOUR
WORK CONTINUES AND YOU ARE
INSPIRED BY THAT, IT WOULD BE
INTERESTING WHAT COMES OUT OF
IT.
>> Stephen: I WOULD BE VERY
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT COMES
OUT OF THIS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
JOIN ME TOMORROW NIGHT AS I
SIT DOWN WITH AN ESTEEMED PANEL
TO FIND OUT THE VALUE OF MY
PORTRAIT.
I ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE PRICE
LISTS, BUT I'M HOPING I CAN GET
TWICE THAT.
