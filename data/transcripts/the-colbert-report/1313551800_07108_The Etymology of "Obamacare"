WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK

PLEASE, HEROES, FOLKS, BARACK
OBAMA IS SPINNING HIS LIES
AGAIN.
FIRST IT WAS WHOPPERS LIKE "I
LOVE AMERICA" AND "I'M THE
PRESIDENT."
(LAUGHTER)
NOW HE IS SPINNING GIVING
AMERICANS HEALTH CARE INTO
SOMETHING POSITIVE.
>> HEALTH CARE REFORM-- ALSO
KNOWN AS OBAMACARE.
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME TELL YOU, I HAVE NO
PROBLEM WITH FOLKS SAYING OBAMA
CARES.
I DO CARE.
>> Stephen: NICE TRY,
MR. PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, YOU CAN SEE THE GAME HE'S
PLAYING HERE.
HE BROKE UP THE WORD OBAMACARE
INTO OBAMA AND CARE.
THAT'S NOT WHERE THAT WORD CAME
FROM THE ETYMOLOGY OF OBAMACARE
IS ACTUALLY OH, BE BAM!
A CAR!
EEE!
(APPLAUSE)
CHECK YOUR DICTIONARY, IT'S IN
THERE.
THIS INDICATES THAT THE PROGRAM
IS LIKE A BUICK THAT HITS YOU IN
THE CROSSWALK AND THEN DRAGS YOU
