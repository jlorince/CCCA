>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, AS A MEMBER OFTHE UPPER MIDDLE STINKING RICH I
SAY IN ONLY THE WORLD'S FINESTHOTELS.
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT LUXURYFAMILIARITY BREEDS RAREFIED
CONTEMPT.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN ONE CIGAR
HUMIDOR YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL.
THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO MIX IT UPSOMETIMES AND GO GLAMOUR
CAMPING.
OR GLAMPING.
(LAUGHTER)THERE'S NO BETTER TRY ENJOY THE
GREAT OUTDOORS WITHOUT GIVING UP600 THREAD COUNT SHEETS, GOURMET
MEALS AND BUTLER SERVICE.
AT THE FINEST ESTABLISHMENTS,EVEN THE WILDLIFE ARE TRAINED IN
SHIATSU MASSAGE.
ALTHOUGH I'M ALWAYS A LILTUNCOMFORTABLE WHEN IT'S A DUDE.
BUT NOW I'VE DISCOVERED AN EVENMORE EXOTIC HYBRID OF LUXURY AND
ROUGHING IT.
IT'S CALLED SHANTYTOWN, ALODGING OPTION AVAILABLE AT THE
EMOYA HOTEL AND SPA INBLOEMFONTEIN IN SOUTH AFRICA.
IT'S MODELED ON THE HOVELS OFSOUTH AFRICA'S TOWNSHIPS.
THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN STAY IN ANAUTHENTIC CORRUGATED TIN SHACK,
EACH WITH ITS OWN BLACK SMOKESPEWING FIRE, BEEF TALLOW CANDLE
AND SQUATTER'S KITCHEN.
LIKE A SANDALS RESORT IF SANDALSWERE MADE FOR AN OLD TIRE.
IT'S GOT NOTHING ON GLAMOURSLUMMING, OR GLUMMING.
NOW YOU CAN EXPERIENCE WHAT IT'SLIKE TO BE TRAPPED IN A
SHANTYTOWN, RESENDING RICHPEOPLE WHO DO THINGS LIKE STAY
IN A PRETEND SHANTYTOWN.
PLUS, IN ADDITION TO DESTITUTIONINSPIRED AMENITIES LIKE OUTSIDE
LONG DROP TOILETS AND SOMETHINGCALLED A DONKEY GEYSER, THERE
ARE ALSO MODERN COMFORTS LIKEUNDERFLOOR HEATING AND WIRELESS
INTERNET ACCESS.
I ASSUME REAL SHANTYTOWNS STILLUSE DIALUP.
AND SINCE THESE HOOVER VILLASACCOMMODATE UP TO 52 GUESTS, THE
SHANTYTOWN IS IDEAL FOR TEAMBUILDING AND FANCY THEME
PARTIES.
OF COURSE THE THEME IS UP TOYOU.
MAYBE A MASQUERADE BALL CALLED"EYES WIDE SHUT TO OTHER
PEOPLE'S SUFFERING."
(LAUGHTER)THE ONLY PROBLEM, IS SOUTH
AFRICA IS REALLY FAR AWAY,FOLKS.
I MEAN IT'S SOUTH OF AFRICA.
THAT'S WHY I'M BRINGING THEGLUMMING EXPERIENCE HOME TO THE
STATES WITH MY NEW RESORT"FRIGIDAIRE LODGE AT OVERPASS
MEADOWS."
(LAUGHTER)JUST MINUTES FROM THE SUMPTUOUS
DECAY OF DOWNTOWN (IN A FRENCHACCENT)
DETROIT.
YOU'LL SAY IN A CARDBOARDREFRIGERATOR BOX FITTED OUT WITH
JAPANESE SATIN MOVING BLANKETSAND MOST OF A PAIR OF SLIPPERS.
ENJOY AN EVENING STROLL OF OURABANDONED LOT, LOVINGLY
LANDSCAPED WITH VINTAGE TRUCKERBOMBS.
JUST DON'T FORGET TO BE BACK INTIME FOR THE NIGHTLY WINE AND
CHEESE STABBING.
ONE LOOK AND YOU'LL KNOW WHYTRIP ADVISOR SAID "AAHH!
RACCOONS!"WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
