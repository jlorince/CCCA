SAD AS YOU ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I LOVE TOMATOES.
THEY'RE THE MOST DELICIOUS FOOD THAT YOU CAN THROW AT A CROSSING GUARD.
I'M A BIG BOY ANDLY CROSS WHERE I WANT.
TOMATOES AND THEIR EAST COAST VARIANT TOMATOES ARE ALSO A KEY PART OF THE CLASSIC AMERICAN
SANDWICH THE BLT, AN I AM NOT SAYING THAT BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS UNDERWRITTEN BY THE BLT COUNCIL,
BUT TO BE CLEAR, THE CLUB SANDWICH IS A LIGHTLY TOASTED,
UNHOLY THREE-WAY WHOSE SIMPLE TRIPLE-DECKER EXISTENCE THREATENS THE SANCTITY OF
TRADITIONAL SANDWICH.
READ YOUR BIBLE, FOLKS.
GOD ORDAINED THAT LUNCH SHOULD BE BETWEEN TWO SLICES OF BREAD,
NO EXCEPTIONS.
LEVITICUS 2018.
AND THAT IS NOT THE ONLY THREAT TO THE AMERICAN WAY OF LUNCH BECAUSE THANKS TO ILLEGALS, OUR
COUNTRY'S TOMATO INDUSTRY IS PLUMB SCREWED.
>> IN THE HEART OF TOMATO COUNTRY, HISPANIC WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE WORKING OFF
THE JOB AND LEAVING THE STATE IN FEAR.
>> THESE FARMERS IN ALABAMA SAY THEY'RE FACING A CRISIS.
THEIR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE ROTTING IN THE FIELDS BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH FARM WORKERS.
>> FARMERS ARE REPORTEDLY SHORT-HANDED BECAUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE FLED THE STATE'S
TOUGHEST IN THE NATION IMMIGRATION LAWS.
>> Stephen: YES, HISPANIC FARM WORKERS HAVE FLED ALABAMA,
STEALING YET ANOTHER THING AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO DO, AND ALL JUST BECAUSE...
[LAUGHTER]
JUST BECAUSE THE STATE PASSED THE ALABAMA...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ALABAMA, FOLKS, AND IT'S ALL JUST BECAUSE THE STATE PASSED AN IMMIGRATION BILL THAT REQUIRES
POLICE TO CHECK PAPERS DURING ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOPS AND MAKES IT A CRIME TO KNOWINGLY
TRANSPORT, HARBOR OR RENT PROPERTY TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
OH, BOO-HOO, AMIGOS.
GROW A PAIR OF WHATEVER THE MEXICAN WORD IS FOR CA HOE NAYS.
ALL ALABAMA WAS TRYING TO DO WAS FREE UP THESE FARM JOBS THAT LOS ILLEGALS ARE TAKING FROM
AMERICANS, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL HICCUP IN THIS OTHERWISE FLAWLESS PLAN.
JIM?
>> WE TRIED DIFFERENT WAYS.
WE TRIED TO GET AMERICAN PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, BUT THEY COME ONE DAY AND THEY QUIT.
>> IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
>> THEY CAN'T CUT IT.
THEY CAN'T TAKE THE HOURS, AND HONESTLY, THEY CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT.
>> THE AMERICANS AREN'T GOING TO GET OUT IN THE HEAT AND WORK.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEND THEIR BACK ALL DAY LONG AND THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO WORK AND THEY'RE NOT AS HARD WORKERS AS THE SPANISH.
>> Stephen: TURNS OUT DIFFERENT ETHNICITYS HAVE DIFFERENT INNATE GIFTS.
HISPANICS ARE GOOD AT HARD LABOR.
ASIANS ARE GOOD AT CALCULUS AND AMERICANS ARE GOOD AT GENERALIZING ABOUT WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE ARE GOOD AT.
[APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
EXCEPT ME.
[LAUGHTER]
LAST YEAR IN MY CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS, I SHARED MY VAST
ONE-DAY EXPERIENCE WORKING AS A FIELD HAND.
[LAUGHTER]
>> IT IS REALLY, REALLY HARD.
FOR ONE THING WHEN YOU'RE PICKING BEAN, YOU HAVE TO SPEND ALL DAY BENDING OVER.
IT TURNS OUT, AND I DO NOT KNOW THIS, MOST SOIL IS AT GROUND LEVEL.
IF WE CAN PUT MAN ON THE MOON,
WHY CAN'T WE MAKE THE EARTH WAIST HIGH.
COME ON, WHERE IS THE FUNDING?
THIS BRIEF EXPERIENCE GAVE ME SOME SMALL UNDERSTANDING OF WHY SO FEW AMERICANS ARE CLAMORING
TO BEGIN AN EXCITING CAREER AS SEASONAL MIGRANT FIELD WORKER.
NOW, I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY WHO SAYS "I TOLL YOU SO."
I'M THE KIND OF GUY WHO MAKES IT A BANNER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, LIBERALS OUT THERE ARE GLOATING THAT ALABAMA IS JUST REAPING WHAT IT SEWED.
WRONG.
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO IMMIGRANTS LEFT TO REAP IT.
FORTUNATELY ALABAMA HAS COME UP WITH A 21st CENTURY SOLUTION,
CHAIN GANGS, BECAUSE ALABAMA FARMERS ARE BEING OFFERED INMATES TO HELP PICK PRODUCE BEFORE IT ROTS.
NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING OUR FOOD TAINTED BY ILLEGAL ALIENS, IT WILL BE HARVESTED BY PERFECTLY
LEGAL CRIMINALS.
THIS PLAN WORKS PERFECTLY IN GEORGIA, OTHER THAN THE WORKING PART.
JIM?
>> GEORGIA'S AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER WILL TELL CONGRESS HIS STATE'S TOUGH NEW
IMMIGRATION LAW HAS LEFT FARMERS SHORT 11,000 WORKERS.
AND INSTEAD OF JOBLESS AMERICANS, SOME OF THE NEW WORKERS ARE PRISONERS AND
EX-CONS WHO FARMERS SAY DON'T WORK AS FAST AS IMMIGRANTS.
>> TURNS OUT AMERICANS WHO HAVE CHOSEN A LIFE OF CRIME DON'T
HAVE QUITE THE SAME WORK ETHIC AS GUATEMALAEN WHO HAVE WALKED THROUGH 500 MILES OF DESERT TO
FEED THEIR CHILDREN.
[APPLAUSE]
SO IT APPEARS... IT APPEARS THAT ALABAMA IS IN A BIT OF A BIND.
REPUBLICAN STATE REP JEREMY ODEN KNOWS WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY HIS LEGISLATION.
JIM?
>> LOOK, WE NEED A FEDERAL PROGRAM, A MAY GRANTED PROGRAM THAT WE CAN APPLY IN OUR STATE
AND GIVE THESE SKILLED LABORERS TO STAY AND HELP THESE PEOPLE OUT.
>> Stephen: YES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST FIX THIS PROBLEM BY SEALING THE STATE BORDERS.
I SAY DEPLOY THE F.B.I., THE NATIONAL GUARD, THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON PHYSICAL FITNESS.
EVERYBODY GET THEM TO ALABAMA TO ARREST WHATEVER IMMIGRANTS ARE LEFT AND THROW THEIR ASSES IN JAIL.
THN WE CAN FORCE THEM TO PICK OUR CROPS AS PRISON LABOR.
THEY'RE SO GOOD AT IT.
BECAUSE TO PRESERVE OUR PRECIOUS BLTs, WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES OTHER THAN OFFER THESE
