( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" ).
OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
FOLKS, WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
I FEEL LIKE I COULD HEAR YOU
CHANT THAT TWICE A NIGHT.
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY HAPPY
CHH-HANUKKAH.
AND I JUST WANT TO URGE ALL MY
JEWISH VIEWERS, IF YOU ARE
LIGHTING A MENORAH TONIGHT, HAVE
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER HANDY.
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
HANUKKAH CAUGHT BIWOTT SURPRISE.
IT IS EARLY THIS YEAR.
IT SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY WE
WERE CELEBRATING CHH-HALLOWEEN.
BUT DURING THE HOLIDAYS, FAMILY
IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND,
PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE AN
ELDERLY AN WEALTHY LOVED ONE
STUBBORNLY CLINGING TO LIFE.
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO
EXPLAINS.
>> WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES
MIDNIGHT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, THE
DEATH TAX WILL GO FROM ZERO TO
55%.
>> Stephen: THANKS YOU, FOX
NEWS BADGER.
JIMMY, CAN WE ACTUALLY SEE A
BADGER UP THERE.
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S TRY A HEDGEHOG.
NAH, BADGER, BADGER.
OKAY.
YOU SEE, WHAT THE SWRUJ IS
TALKING ABOUT IS DUE TO EXPIRING
PROVISIONS IN TAX LAW, IF YOUR
MILLIONAIRE RELATIVE DIES BEFORE
MIDNIGHT ON DECEMBER 31st, YOU
PAY NO INHERITANCE TAX, BUT IF
THEY DIE A MINUTE LATER ON NEW
YEAR'S DAY, YOU PAY 55%, YET
ANOTHER INJUSTICE TO THE
OFT-OVERLOOKED MINORITY,
CHILDREN OF THE OBSCENELY
WEALTHY.
LUCKILY THEY HAVE CHAMPIONS IN
CONGRESS LIKE REPUBLICAN
CORN-PACKER STEVE KING.
JIMMY.
>> I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
MIDNIGHT DECEMBER 31st WITH
THE ESTATE TAX.
IF THE TAXES AREN'T ADDRESSED
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR,
WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE ON THEIR
DEATHBED, FAMILY GATHERED AROUND
THE DEATHBED MAKING LIFE AND
DEATH DECISIONS BASED ON TAX
LIABILITY, AND THIS IS CRUEL,
AND THIS CONGRESS SHOULD ADDRESS
THAT BEFORE THAT SHOULD HAPPEN.
>> YES, WE HAVE TO STOP THE
ESTATE TAX FROM RETURNING AS
SCHEDULED.
IF WE DON'T, WE'RE PUNISHING ALL
THOSE INNOCENT, GOD-FEARING
PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO KILL
NANA FOR THE EXTRA CASH.
IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME WORRY FOR
MY RICH GREAT UNCLE WOODROW.
94 YEARS YOUNG BUT A VERY WEAK
HEART.
YOU NOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO SEND
WOODROW A CHRISTMAS CARD RIGHT
NOW TO TELL HIM THAT I LOVE HIM.
OKAY.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE RECORDABLE
ONES.
>> RECORD YOUR MESSAGE AFTER THE
BEEP.
[BEEP]
>> Stephen: BOOOO!
I LOVE YOU, UNCLE WOODROW.
I HOP YOU GOT THOSE ROLLERBLADES
I SENT YOU.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
GAAAAA!
>> RECORDING:
>> I LOVE YOU, UNCLE WOODROW.
I HOPE YOU GOT THOSE
ROLLERBLADES I SENT YOU.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
GAAAA!
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL HAND DELIVER
THIS, ALONG WITH THIS PILLOW I
HADMENT -- HAD EMBROIDERED.
IT SAYS "GOOD NIGHT."
OF COURSE, THE PRINT IS VERY
SMALL, SO I MAY HAVE TO HOLD THE
PILLOW VERY CLOSE TO HIS FACE
FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES FOR HIM
TO READ IT.
SEE YOU TONIGHT, WOODY,
