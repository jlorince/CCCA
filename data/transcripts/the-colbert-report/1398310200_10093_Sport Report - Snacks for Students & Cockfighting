NOW NATION, I'M A DIEHARDSPORTS FAN.
IN THAT IF NONE OF THEDIEHARD MOVIES ARE ON, I
WILL WATCH SPORTS.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> NATION, I HAVE WARNED YOU
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> NATION, I HAVE WARNED YOU
ABOUT THE DANGERS OFUNIONIZING COLLEGE SPORTS.
LAST MONTH NORTHWESTERNUNIVERSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS
WERE ALLOWED TO FORM AUNION.
WHAT IDIOT TAUGHT THEM TOWORK TOGETHER TOWARD A
COMMON GOAL?
AND EVER SINCE COLLEGIATELETS HAVE BEEN GRIPING, LIKE
SHABAZZ NAPIER, STAR POINTGUARD OF THE CHAMPION UCONN
HUSKIES.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAYTHAT DOESN'T COVER
EVERYTHING.
WE DO HAVE HUNGRY NIGHTSTHAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY TO GET FOOD.
I DON'T THINK, YOU KNOW,STUDENT ATHLETES SHOULD GET
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OFDOLLARS.
LIKE I SAID THERE ARE HUNGRYNIGHTS THAT I GO TO BED AND
I'M STARVING.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT ISWRONG.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING TOBED?
YOU SHOULD BE PRACTICING.
YOU GOT TIME TO LAY DOWN,YOU GOT TIME TO LAY UP.
SADLY, FOLKS, THE NCAA HEARDHIS STARVED RAMBLINGS AND
CRUMBLED FASTER THAN ANUNDERFED POINT GUARD.
>> THE NCAA HAS ANNOUNCEDCOLLEGIATE LETS CAN NOW
RECEIVE UNLIMITED MEALS ANDSNACKS.
THE NEW RULE APPLIES TO BOTHSCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES AND
WALK-ONS.
>> Stephen: UNLIMITED MEALSAND SNACKS.
I MEAN WHO DO THESE PLAYERSTHINK THEY ARE, BASKETBALL
FANS?
(LAUGHTER)COLLEGE ATHLETES NEED TO STAY
HUNGRY, IT MOTIVATES THEM TOWIN CHAMPIONSHIPS.
SO THAT DURING THE GATORADEDUMP THEY CAN SUCK
ELECTROLYTES OFF THE COACH'SWINDBREAKER.
AND I KNOW, THE ONLY REASONFOOTBALL PLAYERS STRIVE TO
MAKE THE TOSTITOS BOWL ISOUT OF HOPE IT IS AN ACTUAL
BOWL OF TOSTITOS.
WORST OF ALL, THESE FREESNACKS VIOLATE THE NUMBER
ONE RULE OF SPORTS.
ONLY WINNERS GET ICE CREAM.
LOSERS HAVE THEIR OWN PRIZE,A SILENT CAR RIDE HOME WITH
DAD.
(LAUGHTER)IF YOU'RE SO HUNGRY,
MISTER, EAT THE TENSION.
NEXT UP ON THE SPORT REPORT,COCK-FIGHTING.
FOLKS, I LOVE THE SWEET ANDSOUR SCIENCE, THE SPORT OF
CHICKEN A LA KING.
COCK FIGHTING IS LIKE MIXEDMARTIAL ARTS MEETS KFC'S
MIXED GRILL BUCKET.
UNFORTUNATELY FORCOCKTHUSIASTS LIKE MYSELF,
I HAVE SOME BADCOCK-A-DOODLE NEWS.
BECAUSE THERE'S A NEWANTI-COCK-FIGHTING BILL IN
LOUISIANA THAT HAS STATESENATOR ELBERT GUILLORY
CRYING YOU WILL FOWL SAYINGTHIS BILL IS FOR THE BIRDS
AND IT'S REALLY RUFFLED HISFEATHERS.
DRUM STICKS.
>> THE STATE SENATOR SAYSTHE BILL THREATENS A SPORT
HE CALLS CHICKEN BOXING.
>> SENATOR ELBERT CALLSCHICKEN BOXING A LEGITIMATE
SPORT.
>> GUILLORY SAYS CHICKENBOXING IS SIMILAR TO HUMAN
BOX, THAT THE MATCHES ARENOT FOUGHT TO THE DEATH.
>> Stephen: YES, CHICKENBOXING, IT'S JUST LIKE HUMAN
BOXING EXCEPT WHEN IT'S OVERTHE CHICKENS HAVE BETTER
SHORT-TERM MEMORY.
AND FOLKS, IT IS PERFECTLYSAFE.
SENATORS GUILLORY EXPLAINEDTHAT THE CHICKENS CAN ENGAGE
IN THEIR SPORT WITHOUTHURTING EACH OTHER.
THEY PUT LITTLE BOXINGGLOVES ON THEM AND THEY
FIGHT IN ROUNDS SO THEY CANGET WATER AND COOL OFF.
IF THEY'RE HOT THEY GETWATER AND IF THEY'RE LOSING
THEY GET OLIVE OIL, SALT ANDPEPPER AND A SQUEEZE OF
LEMON.
PLUS CHICKEN BOXING HASSTRICT RULES LIKE EACH
COMBATANT SHALL WEARSTANDARD FOWL SAFETY BOXING
GEAR.
YES, JUST YOUR STANDARD FOWLSAFETY BOXING GEAR.
JUST CHECK THE POULTRYCOUNTER AT THE SPORTS
AUTHORITY.
PERSONALLY I DO HOPE THATINCLUDES A MOUTH GUARD
BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN TOO MANYCHICKENS WITHOUT ANY TEETH.
SADLY, FOLKS, THE LOUISIANASENATE HAS REJECTED THIS
REASONABLE CHICKEN BOXINGAMENDMENT.
BUT I WANT TO SALUTEGUILLORY FOR TRYING TO KEEP
BIG GOVERNMENT OUT OF OURCHICKEN SPORTING EVENTS.
BECAUSE WHERE DOES IT END?
FIRST IT'S COCK-FIGHTING,NOW CHICKEN BOXING, AM I
GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE MYCHICKEN DOJO?
(LAUGHTER)WHAT'S NEXT, NO MORE POULTRY
JOUSTING?
YOU TELL ME, LOUISIANASENATE, WHAT MANNER OF
CHICKEN COMBAT SHALL YOURLAW ALLOW?
JUST TELL US THE WAY WE CANHAVE CHICKENS ATTACK EACH
OTHER FOR OUR AMUSEMENT ANDWE WILL DO IT.
AND DON'T YOU DARE SAYCHICKEN NASCAR.
BECAUSE SURE THEY CAN WORKTHE GAS PEDAL BUT THEY DON'T
KNOW HOW TO SHIFT ANDTHEY'RE ALWAYS BURNING OUT
THE TRANSMISSION.
SO PLEASE, I BEG YOU,LEGALIZE CHICKEN BOXING.
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS ISNOT ABOUT HUMANS WATCHING
BIRDS PUMMEL EACH OTHER.
IT'S ABOUT HELPING THECHICKENS.
BOXING GIVES THEM A PATH INLIFE, A ONE WAY TICKET OUT
OF PALOOKAVILLE.
SO THAT NONE OF THEM HAS TOTURN TO THEIR OLDER BROTHER
ONE DAY AND SAY IT WAS YOU,CHARLIE.
I COULD HAVE HAD CLASS.
I COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY.
I COULD HAVE BEEN-- ACHICKEN TENDER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
