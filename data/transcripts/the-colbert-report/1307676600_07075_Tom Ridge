MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FORMER
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND
SECURITY AND CURRENT NATURAL
GAS ADVOCATE.
I'LL ASK HIM IF I WILL BE
ALLOWED TO CARRY MOREñr THAN
THREE OUNCES OF METH ANN ON
AN AIRPLANE.
PLEASE WELCOME TOM RIDGE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ÑiÑi
WHOOO, WHOOO.
HEY, MR. SECRETARY.
NOW YOU ARE THE FORM ERR
GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE
OF PENNSYLVANIA, KEYSTONE
STATE, FIRST SECRETARY OF
HOMELAND SECURITY.
AND NOW YOU ARE A LOBBYIST
FOR THE NATURAL GAS
INDUSTRY.
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ON
YOUR SHOW, I HATE TO CORRECT
WITH YOU YOUR FIRST QUESTION,
BUT I'M NOT A LOBBYIST.
CONSIDERING-- SOMETHING THAT
COULD LEAD A REN NANCE IN
AMERICA WITH REGARD TO
ENERGY, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF
CREATING JOBS BUT MAKING US
MORE SECURE, LESS DEPENDENT
ON FOREIGN SOURCES.
SO MY JOB AND I DO HAVE A
PAID JOB AS A CONSULTANT
WITH THE INDUSTRY, IS TO
MAKE SURE ASPEN PEN THAT WE
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
RESOURCE AND DEVELOP IT IN A
WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH
WORKPLACE SAFETY, WITHIN
ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND
PRINCIPLESES AND TO HELP US
BECOME-- CREATE JOBS IN
PENNSYLVANIA AND BECOME LESS
DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN SOURCES
OF FUEL.
>> Stephen: WELL, I ACTUALLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING AND I NOW AGREE WITH
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.
AND I WOULD SAY YOU DID A
VERY GOOD JOB OF LOBBYING ME
JUST NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: YOU SHOULD
REALLY BECOME A LOBBYIST.
YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING.
TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE ABOUT
HOW WE CAN GET THIS JUICY
DELICIOUS NATURAL GAS OUT OF
THE GROUND.
>> WELL, WE'VE BEEN DOING IT
FOR ABOUT ALMOST 50 OR 60
YEARS.
THERE IS A PRACTICE CALLED
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE CALL IT
FRAKING.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF BUMPER
STICKERS, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
THERE IS WILLING WE HAVE
BEEN DOING SINCE THE LATE
'40s.
WE'VE GOT OVER A MILLION
WELLS THAT USE THIS PROCESS.
KIND OF INTERESTING, UNDER
HIGH PRESSURE THEY PUMP
MOSTLY WATER AND SAND, THERE
ARE SOME CHEMICALS TO IT, IT
GOES DOWN A MILE AND THEN
WHAT IS REALLY UNIQUE ABOUT
THIS KIND OF FRAKING SEASON
IS THEN THEY CAN GO
HORIZONTAL.
>> Stephen: IT BREAKS UP
LIKE SHALE DEPOSITS AND THAT
RELAYSES --
>> IT RELAYSES THE NATURAL
GAS.
>> AND.
>> CORRECT, YOU'RE GOT IT
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE
ABOUT THIS IS THAT DURING
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION,
VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY'S
ENERGY TASK FORCE MADE SURE
THAT THE GAS COMPANIES DID
NOT HAVE TO REVEAL WHAT THE
CHEMICALS WERE THAT WERE
BEING PUMPED INTO THE
GROUND.
NOW IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT
SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE
KEROSENE, BENZENE, URIA,
TALUINE, HOW MANY OF THOSE
CAN I FEED MYED TO EM
EVER-- TODDLER?
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE, RIGHT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU WOULD AN BECAUSING
YOUR KIDS IF DID YOU SO
LET'S JUST PUT THAT AWAY.
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
CHEMICALS THEY'RE REALLY
TALKING ABOUT WATER QUALITY,
IN LEGITIMATELY EVERYBODY IS
WORRIED ABOUT WATER QUALITY.
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT
IT.
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER
IS, LISA JACKSON, THE EPA
ADMINISTRATOR ACKNOWLEDGING
THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOSING
THIS PROCESS SINCE THE LATE
40s.
THERE HAVE BEEN OVER A
MILLION WELLS DUG THAT HAVE
BEEN FRAKKED AND THERE IS
NOT A SINGLE CASE WITH THOSE
MILLION WELLS THAT ANY OF
THAT MATERIAL HAS EVER
POLLUTED ANY OF THE WATER.
AND FRANKLY THE INDUSTRY-- .
>> Stephen: LET'S DISPELL A
MYTH.
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE IMAGE OF
FLAMING WATER.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: LET'S SHOW THESE
AND --
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> OH,.
>> Stephen: OKAY, PEOPLE SAY
THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE
WELLS NEAR THE HOUSE, THE
METHANE IS GETTING IN THE
WATER SUPPLY AND THEY ARE
WATER BURNS, WHICH I A SAY
IS A PLUS.
YOU CAN WASH YOUR VEG TABLES
AND GRILL THEM AT THE SAME
TIME.
IS THAT-- IS THAT REALLY
HAPPENING TO PEOPLE'S WATER
SUPPLIES, SIR.
>> YES, IT IS HAPPENING TO
SOME WATER SUPPLIES.
AND IT HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH HYDRAULIC
TRACKING.
>> METHANE GAS IS NATURALLY
OCCURRING, IT IS IN SOME OF
THE WATER WELLS IN
PENNSYLVANIA LONG BEFORE ANY
WELLS WERE LOCATED NEXT TO
THEM IT IS NATURALLY
OCCURRING AND OCCURRINGS ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: IT DOES OCCUR
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT IN
SEPTEMBER OF 2010-- LET'S
DISPEL THIS BECAUSE I THINK
THERE IS A WORK AROUND EVEN
IF IT DOES HAPPEN.
IN SEPTEMBER OF 2010 THE EPA
WARNED RESIDENTS OF A
WYOMING TOWN WHERE FRAING
WAS TAKING PLACE TO USE FANS
WHILE SHOWERING TO AVOID THE
RISK OFÑi EXPLOSION.
THAT PROVES THERE IS A WORK
AROUND.
JUST INFALL A FAN IN YOUR
SHOWER.
>> AND DON'T SMOKE IN YOUR
SHOWER EITHER.
>> Stephen: SO ISN'T THAT
THE EPA SAYING IT IS
HAPPENING.
>> THE EPA IS LEGITIMATELY
IDENTIFYING AN HISTORICAL
FACT.
NATURALLY OCCURRING METHANE
GAS OFTEN ENDS UP IN WATER
WELLS AND DOW HAVE THAT
SITUATION.
BUT THERE'S NOT BEEN A
SINGLE PROVEN INSTANCE WHERE
IT HAS BEEN RELATED TO
HYDRAULIC FRAKING.
>> Stephen: SOLAR POWER?
THEY WILL SUCK SO MUCH
ENERGY THAT EVENTUALLY THE
SUN WILL GO OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RIGHT, WE WILL
HAVE A SUN SPILL S THIS A
MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY.
YOU USED TO BE HEAD OF
HOMELAND SECURITY IS THIS A
MATTER OF HOMELAND SECURITY
IN ANY WAY TO NEW.
>> IT DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT
OF VIEW, WHETHER YOU WANT TO
SEND A BILLION DOLLARS A DAY
TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES SOME
UNSTABLE, UNFRIENDLY
COUNTRIES OR WHETHER YOU
WANT A BUNCH OF LEADERS AND
COUNTRIES DECIDING THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO INCREASE THE
PRODUCTION OF OIL WHICH
MEANS OUR GAS PRICE GOES
THROUGH THE ROOF IT IS A
MATTER OF ECONOMIC SECURITY,
A MATTER OF NATIONAL
SECURITY.
>> Stephen: THE ONLY THING
THAT WORRIES ME IS SAY YOU
ARE DRILLING A MILE DOWN
THERE.
WHAT IF WE ENRAGE THE MOLE
PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
HAVE YOU MADE ANY PLANS FOR
THAT.
>> THAT IS ONE CONTINGENCY I
WOULD BE A BLACK SWAN EVENT.
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT
WHEN IT OCCURS.
>> Stephen: PLEASE DO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOVERNOR TOM RIDGE, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.
