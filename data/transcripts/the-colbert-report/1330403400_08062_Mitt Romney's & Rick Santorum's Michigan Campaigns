(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU'RE VERY KIND!
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
WHY NOT?
NATION, TOMORROW IS THE MICHIGAN
PRIMARY AND MITT ROMNEY KNOWS
HE'S GOT TO WIN IT.
SO ON FRIDAY HE GAVE THE SPEECH
OF A LIFETIME AT DETROIT'S FORD
FIELD.
>> G.O.P. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
MITT ROMNEY'S BIG ECONOMIC
SPEECH IN DETROIT WAS DWARFED
AND OVERSHADOWED BY ITS
LOCATION-- FORD FIELD.
WHILE ROMNEY DREW A CROWD OF
ABOUT 1,200 PEOPLE YESTERDAY,
THE 65,000 EMPTY STADIUM
SEATS... WELL, KIND OF HARD NOT
TO NOTICE THOSE
>> YEAH, THERE WERE A LOT OF
EMPTY SEATS BUT THE IMPORTANT
THING IS MITT REALLY CONNECTED
WITH THOSE EMPTY SEATS BY ALSO
BEING PLASTIC AND UNCOMFORTABLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE'S BACK.
JIM?
>> THIS FEELS GOOD BEING BACK IN
MICHIGAN.
YOU KNOW, THE TREES ARE THE
RIGHT HEIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ONCE AGAIN, ROMNEY
IS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE COURAGE
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MICHIGAN
TREE HEIGHTS.
(LAUGHTER)
MEANWHILE OBAMA REMAINS
SUSPICIOUSLY SILENT ON OUR
NATIONAL TREE ALTITUDE
CONTROVERSY.
DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THOSE
SEQUOIAS IN CALIFORNIA.
LOOK, I'M FLATTERED BUT I'M NOT
INTO THAT LIFE-STYLE.
THEN TO CLINCH THE CRUCIAL
MICHIGAN PRIMARY MITT WENT TO
FLORIDA TO SEE THE DAYTONA 500
WHERE HE PROVES HE'S JUST AN
AVERAGE MOTOR HEAD.
LISTEN TO HIM GUSH ON LOCAL
RADIO ABOUT CLOSELY HE FOLLOWS
NASCAR.
>> NOT AS CLOSELY AS SOME OF THE
MOST ARDENT FANS BUT I HAVE SOME
GREAT FRIENDS THAT ARE NASCAR
TEAM OWNERS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: WE ALL KNOW THAT
FEELING!
WE ALL THAT FEELING.
WHAT YOUNG NASCAR FAN DOESN'T
HAVE HIS BEDROOM WALL PLASTERED
WITH POSTERS OF OWNER JACK
ROUSH?
(LAUGHTER)
THE ROUSHTER!
FOLKS, THIS IS THE TICKET FOR
ROMNEY.
IF HE WANTS TO WIN, DHOSHD MORE
OF THIS REGULAR GUY STUFFBHAT
HE OBVIOUSLY LOVES.
I MEAN, HE SHOULD EAT HOT DOGS
AND SAY "I LOVE HOT DOGS,
THEY'RE JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH."
(LAUGHTER)
"THE MUSTARD IS YELLOW.
THAT'S THE RIGHT COLOR.
THE BUN HAS THE RIGHT BRED DI
THEN HE SHOULD MENTION HE GOES
YACHTING WITH HIS FRIEND
CARLISLE HOT DOG, IV, THE GREAT
GRANDSON OF THE INVENTOR OF THE
HOT DOG.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AS GREAT AS ROMNEY DID, RICK
SANTORUM IS CONFIDENT.
HE'S ALREADY LOOKING PAST
MICHIGAN TO HIS REAL OPPONENT,
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE SAID HE
WANTS EVERYBODY IN AMERICA TO GO
TO COLLEGE.
WHAT A SNOB!
(LAUGHTER)
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO GO
OUT AND WORK HARD EVERYDAY AND
PUT THEIR SKILLS TO TASK THAT
AREN'T TAUGHT BY SOME LIBERAL
COLLEGE PROFESSOR TRYING TO
INDOCTRINATE THEM.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WHAT A SNOB.
OBAMA THINKS EVERYBODY SHOULD GO
TO COLLEGE LIKE HE DID.
WELL, PARDON ME, YOUR HIGHNESS,
BUT SOME OF US WEREN'T HANDED A
TICKET TO HARVARD BY BEING THE
BIRACIAL SON OF A SINGLE MOTHER
ON FOOD STAMPS.
(LAUGHTER)
MUST BE NICE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SANTORUM THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RICK SANTORUM UNDERSTANDS THE
REAL AMERICAN DREAM-- THAT IF
YOU WORK HARD ENOUGH YOUR
CHILDREN CAN HAVE FEWER
OPPORTUNITIES THAN YOU DID.
(LAUGHTER)
AND SANTORUM KNOWS SOMETHING
EVEN MORE DANGEROUS ABOUT
COLLEGE THAN THE RISK THAT OUR
CHILDREN MIGHT SUCCEED.
JIM?
>> 62% OF KIDS WHO ENTER COLLEGE
WITH SOME SORT OF COMMITMENT
LEAVE WITHOUT IT.
>> Stephen: NOW I HAVE NO IDEA
IF THAT'S A REAL STATISTIC SO
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT ON FAITH
THAT HE DIDN'T YANK THAT OUT OF
HIS ASS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
I'LL LET SOME COLLEGE GRAD LOOK
IT UP ON HIS FANCY INTERNET.
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS, A PERSON OF FAITH
CANNOT GO TO COLLEGE WITHOUT
LOSING THEIR BELIEF IN GOD.
I MEAN, LOOK AT RICK SANTORUM.
HE HAS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE, AN
M.B.A. AND A LAW DEGREE.
HE'S LOMB ALMOST COMPLETELY LOST
HIS FAITH.
HE ENROLLED AS A FRESHMEN AT
PENN STATE HE WAS A 14th CENTURY
MONK.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S NOT JUST FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES
FOLKS.
OUR GODLESS PRESIDENT OVER HERE
HAS BEEN PUSHING A PLAN TO SEND
YOUNG PEOPLE TO ALL SORTS OF
ATHEIST IVORY TOWER
INSTITUTIONS.
>> TONIGHT I ASK EVERY AMERICAN
TO COMMIT TO AT LEAST ONE YEAR
OR MORE OF HIGHER EDUCATION OR
CAREER TRAINING.
IT CAN BE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR
A FOUR-YEAR SCHOOL.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR
APPRENTICESHIP.
>> Stephen: VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
HOW DARE YOU, SIR?
YOU WANT TO SEND OUR GOOD
GOD-FEARING CHILDREN TO I.T.T.
AND THEY'LL COME BACK AS TRUTH
SPOUTING ATHEIST GAY TRUCK
MECHANICS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I AM DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW.
MY FURNACE IN THE STUDIO HAS
BEEN ON THE FRITZ SO I HAD TO
CALL IN ONE OF THESE RADICAL
LEFTIST REPAIRMEN.
HANK, HOW'S IT GOING OVER THERE?
>> HELLO, LITTLE GOD-MAN.
ARE YOU ANXIOUS FOR YOUR MAGIC
HOT-AIR MACHINE TO WORK AGAIN?
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD PRAY TO THE
INVISIBLE BEARDED FATHER IN THE
SKY.
>> Stephen: HANK, YOU WERE A
DEVOUT BAPTIST BEFORE YOU WENT
TO TRADE SCHOOL.
>> OH, YES, BUT UPON LEARNING
THE NUANCES OF H.V.A.C.-- THAT'S
HEATING, VENTILATING AND AIR KK
TO THE UNINITIATED-- THE IDEA OF
AN OMNISCIENT CLOUD MAN SEEMED
QUAINT.
IT IS SCIENCE NOT YAHWEH THAT
COOLS YOU IN THE SUMMER AND
HEATS YOU IN THE WINTER
>> I KNOW THAT, HANK, BUT
H.V.A.C. DOESN'T EXPLAIN ALL THE
MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE?
>> I WAS ONCE LIKE YOU-- DRUNK
ON THE OPIATE OF THE MASSES.
THEN TWO YEARS PLUS EVENINGS AND
WEEKENDS AS DEVRY REVEALED THE
EMPTINESS BEHIND YOUR RELIGIOUS
DELUSIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
GOD IS DEAD AND BASE BOARD
HEATING IS AN ABOMINATION!
(LAUGHTER)
>> SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH MY
THERMOSTAT.
>> GOD ONLY KNOWS.
>> Stephen: THANKS, HANK, WE'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.
