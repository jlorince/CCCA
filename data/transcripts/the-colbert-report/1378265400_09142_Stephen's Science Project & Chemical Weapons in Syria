[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: HEY, THANK YOU.
YEAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, THE FIRST THING I WANT TO
DO TONIGHT IS I WANT TO...
PLEASE.
FOLKS, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT
HERE TO WELCOME BACK MY GOOD
FRIEND JON STEWART OVER AT "THE
DAILY SHOW" TONIGHT, COMING BACK
TO THE SEAT AFTER 12 WEEKS NOW.
JOHN OLIVER DID A FINE JOB, BUT
AS THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW,
I FIND IT MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE
TO GET NEWS FROM SOMEONE WITH AN
ENGLISH ACCENT.
[LAUGHTER]
NO OFFENSE.
NO OFFENSE.
AND, FOLKS, IT'S GREAT TO BE
BACK AFTER MY TWO-WEEK BREAK,
WHICH, BY THE WAY, I DID NOT
SPEND LYING AROUND LIKE SOME
UNEMPLOYED GUY, ALTHOUGH I DID
COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
NO, NO, NO.
I LIKE TO GIVE BACK ON MY
VACATION, THAT'S WHY I DONATED
MY BODY TO SCIENCE BY GOING TO
ITALY AND DOING GROUND-BREAKING
RESEARCH IN HOW MANY PLATES OF
BLACK TRUFFLE FETTUCINI THE
HUMAN BODY CAN WITHSTAND BEFORE
ORGANS BEGIN TO SHUT DOWN.
[LAUGHTER]
MY FINDINGS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN
THE "NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF ARE
YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT?."
NOW, FOLKS, I DO NOT SPRACKEN ZE
ITALIANO, SO WHILE I WAS
OVERSEAS, I COULDN'T REALLY GET
MUCH OUT OF THE NEWS, BUT FROM
WHAT I COULD MAKE OUT, PRESIDENT
OBAMA WANTED TO DROP MILEY CYRUS
ON DAMASCUS.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I BELIEVE THAT'S A WAR CRIME.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, FOLKS, I HAVE SINCE LEARNED
THAT THE REAL STORY WAS ABOUT
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.
>> THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
NOW KNOWS THAT AT LEAST 1,429
SYRIANS WERE KILLED IN THIS
ATTACK, INCLUDING AT LEAST 4THE
4THE -- 426 CHILDREN.
THIS IS THE INDISCRIMINATE,
INCONCEIVABLE HORROR OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.
>>
>> Stephen: THE UNITED STATES
HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO ATTACK
SYRIA BECAUSE DICTATOR BASHAR
AL-ASSAD IS KILLING HIS OWN
PEOPLE WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
BEFORE HE WAS JUST KILLING THEM
WITH BULLETS, BUT IF AMERICA
CARED ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE,
WE'D BE INVADING CHICAGO.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, FOLKS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THIS STORY... THIS STORY IS
SLOWLY DEVELOPING.
WE WILL HAVE MORE
