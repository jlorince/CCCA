FOLKS, WHEN I PLAY SPORTS, I
LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FIELD
BECAUSE THE LINES TO THE
BATHROOM ARE WAY TOO LONG.
THIS IS "THE SPORT REPORT."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FIRST UP, BASKETBALL.
NATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE
GREATEST ATHLETE WHO EVER LIVED
OR WHO WILL EVER LIVE IS MICHAEL
JORDAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I HAVE HAD A PHOTO OF THAT MAN
ON MY SET FROM DAY ONE, AND IT'S
BECAUSE OF HIS INFLUENCE THAT
EVERY TIME I'M ABOUT TO NAIL A
PARTICULARLY HARD GUEST, I STICK
MY TONGUE OUT.
AND AS A CHAMPION, M.J. THRIVED
ON ACHIEVING THE IMPOSSIBLE, AND
FOLKS, HE'S AT IT AGAIN.
CHECK OUT HIS NEW COMMERCIAL FOR
HANES UNDERWEAR WHERE MICHAEL
JORDAN IS TRYING TO BRING BACK
THE HITLER MUSTACHE.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
OH, NEIN, HE DI-N'T.
[LAUGHTER]
BOLD.
THAT IS A BOLD CHOICE.
AND, FOLKS, WE ALL STILL WANT TO
BE LIKE MIKE.
PERSONALLY, I CANNOT WAIT TO
ENROLL MY KIDS IN MICHAEL
JORDAN'S MEIN BASKETBALL CAMPF.
OF COURSE, THIS LITTLE 'STACHE
DREW A FOUL FROM JORDAN'S OLD
BASKETBALL, GOLFING AND SERIOUS
GAMBLING PROBLEM BUDDY CHARLES
BARKLEY.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE
WAS THINKING, AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HANES WAS THINKING.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST STUPID.
I SHOOT COMMERCIALS ALL THE
TIME.
THEY HAVE A LADY THAT STANDS
THERE AND LOOKS AT EVERY PIECE
OF CHEESE ON MY TACO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: WELL, CHARLES, MAYBE
IF YOU PUT ON PAIR OF HANES, SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE TO STARE AT YOUR
TACO.
WELL, I FOR ONE SAY, GO FOR IT,
MICHAEL.
HITLER'S A BAD GUY, BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE THE MUSTACHE KILLED
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
PLUS, JORDAN TONES IT DOWN BY
ADDING THE SOUL PATCH.
OKAY.
YOU ADD A SOUL PATCH FROM HITLER
AND HE GOES FROM GENOCIDAL
MANIAC TO JAZZ DRUMMER.
I'VE ALWAYS SAID, IT'S A VERY
FINE LINE.
SPEAKING OF CRIMES AGAINST
HUMANITY, SOCCER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
A LITTLE GIFT FOR YOU, MY
FRIEND.
THE WORLD CUP STARTS TOMORROW,
FOLKS.
I MEANT TO SAY THE WORLD CUP
STARTS TOMORROW, [BLEEPED] SO
IT'S A BIG EVENT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
EXCITING ACTION.
WHAT DAY IS IT?
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD
POSSIBLY MAKE ME CARE ABOUT
SOCCER IS REVENGE.
LUCKILY ON SATURDAY THE WRITES
IS SET TO FACE ENGLAND IN THE
FIRST ROUND WHICH MEANS WE'LL
FINALLY HAVE CHANCE TO GET BACK
AT THOSE LIMEY BASTARDS FOR THE
OIL SPILL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BEAT
'EM.
OKAY.
HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BEAT
'EM.
OKAY.
LATE IN THE SECOND HALF WE SEND
U.S. FORWARD ROBBIE FINDLEY
SPRINTING DOWN THE SIDELINES AS
EDSON BUDDLE LOOPS AROUND
BRITAIN'S CENTER MIDDIE AND
PASSES TO LANDON DONOVAN.
DONOVAN GETS SET UP FOR THE GOAL
AND WE DUMP TEN MILLION GALLONS
OF CRUDE OIL ON THEIR SIDE OF
THE FIELD.
>> CROWD U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A!
[APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: THAT IS SOME LIGHT
SWEET CRUDE.
THEN WE STOP PLAY WHILE SHRIMP
FISHERMEN IN HAZMAT SUITS SCRUB
DOWN THE BRITISH TEAM WITH
TOOTHBRUSHES, WHICH WILL HAVE
THE ADDED BENEFIT OF INTRODUCING
THE BRITISH TO THE CONCEPT OF
TOOTHBRUSHES.
EVEN IF ALL THIS CAME THE PASS,
I STILL DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE AS AN
AMERICAN I DON'T CARE ABOUT
SOCCER.
SOCCER IS JUST ONE MORE THING
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS TRYING
TO JAM DOWN OUR THROATS, LIKE
THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THE GENEVA
CONVENTION.
HERE TO VICIOUSLY CONFIRM MY
PREJUDICE, PLEASE WELCOME
WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST AND
NOTED SOCCER BALL BUSTER MARC
FISHER.
MARC, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
OKAY, MARC, FIRST QUESTION, THE
REST OF THE WORLD LOVES SOCCER.
WHY IS THE REST OF THE WORLD
WRONG?
[LAUGHTER]
>> WE'RE IN THE FIFTH DECADE NOW
OF BEING TOLD THAT SOCCER IS
ABOUT THE HAPPEN IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S AN ELEGANT
SPORT.
>> IT AINT EVER HAPPENING.
SOCCER IS UNMESH BECAUSE IT'S
TOO SIMPLISTIC.
IT'S A GREAT GAME FOR LITTLE
KIDS RUNNING AROUND ON THE
FIELD.
THEY GET THEIR CARDIO IN.
THEY EAT COOKIES.
BUT THEN THEY GROW UP.
>> STEPHEN: RIGHT, THEY GROW UP.
>> WHEN THEY GROW UP, THEY'RE
FINISHED WITH SOCCER BECAUSE
THEY CRAVE COMPLEXITY.
THEY LIKE GAMES THAT ARE
COMPLEX.
WE LIKE GAMES WITH TIME IN AND
TIME OUT.
>> STEPHEN: WE WANT THINGS TO
HAPPEN.
>> JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS
POPULAR, DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
RICE IS THE MOST POPULAR FOOD ON
EARTH.
>> STEPHEN: RIGHT, RIGHT,
FOREIGN COUNTRIES WEAR
NUT-HUGGER JEANS.
YOU WON'T SEE US DOING THAT OVER
HERE.
NOW, TO BE FAIR, HERE TO DEFEND
THE WORLD CUP, PLEASE WELCOME
VETERAN "NEWSWEEK" CONTRIBUTOR
WHO NOW WRITES FOR THE GLOBAL
POST.COM, MR. MARK STARR.
MARK, THANKS FOR COMING ON.
WAIT A SECOND.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
OFFEND YOU.
I KNOW YOU'RE A SOCCER FAN.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT SOCCER IS
A SPORT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> IT'S PLAYED BY THE GREATEST
ATHLETES IN THE WORLD.
>> STEPHEN: THEY'RE NOT AMERICAN
ATHLETES.
>> THE AVERAGE MID-FIELDER IN
SOCCER RUNS SEVEN MILES, THAT'S
ABOUT TWO OR THREE MORE MILES
THAN KOBE BRYANT IS GOING TO
RUB.
>> STEPHEN: NOBODY GOES INTO A
STADIUM TO WATCH PEOPLE JOG.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'RE ON THE ROPE.
YOU'RE ON THE ROPE.
NOW LISTEN, SIR...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHY DON'T THEY DO FOOTBALL, REAL
FOOTBALL?
>> THEY ARE DOING BASKETBALL.
THEY DO BASEBALL IN SOME PARTS
OF THE WORLD, BUT THERE IS NONE
OF THIS CRAZED NATIONALISM.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT SOCCER
HOOLIGANS.
>> NONE OF OUR SPORTS DO YOU
HAVE TO HAVE THE FANS PINNED
BEHIND A CHAIN LINK FENCE.
>> STEPHEN: SIR, ARE YOU A
SOCCER HOOLIGAN?
HOW MANY CARS DID YOU OVERTURN
BEFORE YOU CAME IN HERE
>> APPARENTLY THIS MAN HAS NEVER
BEEN TO ANY GAME IN
PHILADELPHIA.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S TRUE.
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOOLIGANISM
AND THE FESTIVE AT MS FEAR.
WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON
THE PITCH.
I THINK THEY HOLD THE WORLD CUP
EVERY FOUR YEARS BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW OFTEN THERE IS A SCORE.
>> THESE ARE THE GREATEST
ATHLETES OF THE WORLD.
THEY'RE NOT FREAKS OF NATURE.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT'S A FREAK OF
NATURE?
>> SOMEONE WHO IS SEVEN FEET
TALL.
>> STEPHEN: FREAK OF NATURE?
THEY PREFER TO BE CALLED AFRICAN
AMERICANS.
I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE.
YOU ARE... THAT IS A TERRIBLY
OFFENSIVE THING FOR YOU TO SAY.
[LAUGHTER]
I APOLOGIZE, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
MARK STARR, MARC FISHER, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THE WORLD CUP STARTS TOMORROW.
