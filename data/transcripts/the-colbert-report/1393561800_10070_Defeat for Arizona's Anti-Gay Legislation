THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, THANKYOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANKS SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
AND, FOLKS, I ESPECIALLY WANT TOTHANK ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE
JOINING US TONIGHT.
THEI WILL GET TO MY COVERAGE OF
BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN JUST AMOMENT.
BUT I'M SORRY, APPARENTLY ALLSTRAIGHT PEOPLE
ARE NOW LEGALLY REQUIRED TO MAKEWEDDING CAKES FOR GAY PEOPLE.
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, ARIZONAGOVERNOR AND DINER WAITRESS
WORKING A 60-HOUR SHIFT,JAN BREWER, VETOED SB1062,
A BILL PROTECTING MY RELIGIOUSRIGHT TO DENY SODOMITES PASTRY.
AND JUST LISTEN WHY.
>> SENATE BILL 1062 DOES NOTADDRESS A SPECIFIC OR PRESENT
CONCERN RELATED TO RELIGIOUSLIBERTY IN ARIZONA.
I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE EXAMPLE INARIZONA WHERE A BUSINESS OWNER'S
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY HAS BEENVIOLATED.
>> Stephen:  EXCUSE ME,GOVERNOR.
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEERELIGIOUS LIBERTY BEING
VIOLATED, DOESN'T MEAN ITDOESN'T EXIST.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE FAITH ANDBELIEVE THAT GAYS ARE DESTROYING
CHRISTIANITY.
( LAUGHTER )AND I HAVE THAT FAITH, AND I SEE
GAY ATTACKS EVERYWHERE I LOOK.
LIKE ON THIS MIRACULOUS IMAGE ONMY GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH.
THERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THAT GAY ORGY RIGHTTHERE.
( LAUGHTER )PLAIN AS DAYS, FOLKS.
USUALLY, I ONLY SEE JESUS IN MYGRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH-- OH,
BOY, HE'S IN THERE, TOO.
I HAVE TO GET HIM OUT THERE.
JESUS IS SAFE NOW IN MY TUM-TUM.
LET'S GET BACK TO MY CELEBRATIONOF BLACK HISTORY.
I WILL BE DEDICATING THE REST OFFEBRUARY AFRICAN AMERICAN
HERITAGE.
IT IS SUCH A RICH, MULTIFACETEDCULTURE FOR WHITE PEOPLE TO
EMBRACE AND MAKE LESS BLACK.
FOR INSTANCE, JAZZ.
WE SMOOTHED THAT OUT FOR YOU,YOU'RE WELCOME.
( APPLAUSE )AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHILE
NOT ALL OF US ARE BLACK WE AREALL VICTIMS OF RACISM.
SLAVERY IS AMERICA'S ORIGINALSIN, OUR PRIMAL WOUND, AND 150
YEARS LATER, ITS TERRIBLE LEGACYSTILL LOOMS OVER AMERICAN LIFE
SO LARGE THAT IT'S ALMOSTIMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT RACE
WITHOUT OFFENDING SOMEONE,ESPECIALLY KOREANS.
( LAUGHTER )THEY'RE A HUMORLESS PEOPLE.
BUT NOW SOMETHING CAN FINALLY BEDONE TO LIFT THE PAINFUL BURDEN
OF RACISM ONCE AND FOR ALL.
IT COMES FROM A STORY I HEARD ONNPR.
NOW, I KNOW, BUT I WAS DRIVING ARENTAL AND THE KNOB WAS TORN
OFF.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
IT WAS A REPORT ON THE NATIONALLONGITUDINAL SURVEY OF YOUTH,
WHICH TRACKED YOUNG PEOPLE OVER19 YEARS TO SEE HOW THEIR LIVES
HAD CHANGED, AND ONE OF THERESEARCHERS, STANFORD
SOCIOLOGIST ALIYA SAPERSTEIN,FOUND SOMETHING TRULY SHOCKING.
>> SAPERSTEIN FOUND THAT THERACIAL CLASSIFICATION OF PEOPLE
IN THE SURVEY SEEMED TO CHANGEOVER TIME.
>> WHAT OUR RESEARCH CHALLENGESIS THIS IDEA THAT THE RACE OF AN
INDIVIDUAL IS FIXED.
20% OF THE RESPONDENTSEXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE CHANGE
IN HOW THE INTERVIEWER PERCEIVEDTHEM BY RACE OVER THE COURSE OF
DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS.
>> Stephen:  YES, YOUR RACECAN CHANGE OVER TIME.
MUCH LIKE HOW IN WINTER, JOHNBOEHNER FADES FROM PUMPKIN TO
BUTTERNUT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER )
WHILE THIS IS AMAZING, IT'SEXTRAORDINARY STORY.
SO WHAT WOULD CAUSE SOMEONE'SRACE TO CHANGE I SAY YOU ASK?
WELL, IF SOMEONE IN THE STUDYWENT TO JAIL, THE INTERVIEWER
WAS MORE LIKELY TO SEE THEPERSON AS BLACK.
NO WONDER THOSE WHITE POWERPRISON GANGS ARE SO SCARY.
THEY'RE ALL BLACK GUYS.
( LAUGHTER )POINT IS, AMERICANS BELIEVE
BLACK PEOPLE DO CERTAIN THINGS.
THEREFORE, PEOPLE WHO DO THOSETHINGS MUST BE BLACK, OR AS NPR
PUT IT, "IT'S NOT JUST OURPERCEPTIONS OF RACE THAT DRIVE
OUR STEREOTYPES, BUT OURSTEREOTYPES THAT DRIVE OUR
PERCEPTIONS OF RACE."
YES, OUR PERCEPTIONS OF RACE AREDRIVEN BY RACIAL STEREOTYPES,
WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE ALWAYSGETTING PULLED OVER.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, INCREDIBLY, YOU CAN EVEN
UNDERGO A RACE CHANGE AFTERYOU'RE DEAD BECAUSE THE STUDY
FOUND THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAD TIEDAS A RESULT OF HOMICIDE, FUNERAL
DIRECTORS WERE MORE LIKELY TOLIST THE PERSON AS BEING BLACK
AND IF THE PERSON DIED OFALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS, THE FUNERAL
DIRECTOR WAS MORE LIKELY TO LISTTHE PERSON AS BEING NATIVE
AMERICAN.
AND THEY LIST YOU AS WHITE IFYOU CHOCKED ON KALE CHIPS WHILE
DANCING TO JASON MRAZ( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )STEREOTYPES CAN EVEN CHANGE WHAT
RACE YOU THINK YOU ARE BECAUSEWHEN PEOPLE WENT TO PRISON THEY
BECAME MORE LIKELY TO THINK OFTHEMSELVES AS BLACK.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, IT'S A TWO-WAYSTREET.
BECAUSE FOR POSITIVEEXPERIENCES, THE EFFECTS ARE IN
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
FOLKS I BELIEVE WE CAN USEAMERICA'S INESCAPABLE RACISM TO
DEFEAT AMERICA'S INESCAPABLERACISM.
HERE'S HOW IT WOULD WORK.
MINORITIES HAVE TO BEHAVE INWAYS THAT CHANGE OUR PERCEPTION
OF THEIR RACE.
FOR INSTANCE, MEXICANS, YOU CANSEEM A LOT LESS MEXICAN IF YOU
COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL THE MEXICANSCOMING HERE TO STEAL OUR JOBS.
( LAUGHTER )THINK ABOUT IT.
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A MEXICANDOING YOUR JOB, AND SLEEPING
WITH YOUR WIFE.
( LAUGHTER )AND, NATIVE AMERICANS, IF YOU
TURN THOSE CASINOS INTO TECHSUPPORT CALL CENTERS, SUDDENLY
YOU'RE AN ACTUAL INDIAN.
( LAUGHTER )OF COURSE, THE QUICKEST WAY TO
ACHIEVE RACIAL EQUALITY IS TOJUST SEND EVERYONE TO PRISON.
THEN WE WOULD ALL BE BLACK.
AND ONCE WE'RE ALL BLACK, MAYBEAMERICANS WILL FINALLY REALIZE
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT COLORYOU ARE.
SO I PICK WHITE.
I WONDER WHAT RACE THAT MAKES MESEEM LIKE?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
