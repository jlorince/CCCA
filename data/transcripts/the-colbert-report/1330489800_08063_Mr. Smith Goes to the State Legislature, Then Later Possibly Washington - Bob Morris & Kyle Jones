[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BARK EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION --
NATION, THE RACE FOR THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IS
ENTERING ITS FORTY-THIRD MONTH,
AND MITT ROMNEY STILL HASN'T
LOCKED IT DOWN.
AT THIS POINT, HE MAY HAVE TO
USE HIS BACKUP PLAN FOR FUTURE
MORMONS TO POSTHUMOUSLY BAPTIZE
HIM PRESIDENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED TO
RECRUIT VARIOUS GOVERNORS.
JEB BUSH WOULDN'T DO IT.
CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID HE WASN'T
READY.
AND MITCH DANIELS DISAPPEARED
WEEKS AGO BETWEEN THE COUCH
CUSHIONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
4JQjPRESIDENT?
WELL, REMEMBER, JUST TWO YEARS
BEFORE BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCED
HIS RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY, HE
WAS A STATE SENATOR.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE LATEST
INSTALLMENT OF "MR. SMITH GOES
TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE, THEN
LATER, POSSIBLY WASHINGTON."
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PEOPLE LOVE THE STATE
LEGISLATURE.
OUR FIRST RISING STAR COMES FROM
INDIANA.
>> AN INDIANA LAWMAKER IS TAKING
A STAND AGAINST GIRL SCOUTS.
STATE REPRESENTATIVE BOB MORRIS
SAID HE'S AGAINST CELEBRATING
THE GROUP'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY.
>> IN A LETTER THAT HE WROTE TO
HIS FELLOW REPRESENTATIVES HE
SAYS, "THE GIRL SCOUTS ARE A
QUOTE RADICALIZED ORGANIZATION
THAT PROMOTE ABORTION AND
HOMOSEXUALITY."
>> Stephen: YES.
THEY MEET IN A CHURCH BASEMENT
ONCE A WEEK, HOLD BAKE SALES TO
RAISE MONEY FOR FIELD TRIPS, AND
VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME TO HELP THE
ELDERLY.
YOU KNOW, GAY STUFF!
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND BOB MORRIS ISN'T JUST
PULLING THESE ACCUSATIONS OUT OF
HIS TOTALLY STRAIGHT ASS.
IN A LETTER TO HIS FELLOW
LEGISLATORS, HE SAID, QUOTE,
"I DID A SMALL AMOUNT OF
WEB-BASED RESEARCH, AND WHAT I
FOUND IS DISTURBING."
[ LAUGHTER ]
YES, AND I DID AN EVEN SMALLER
AMOUNT OF WEB-BASED RESEARCH BY
TYPING GIRL SCOUTS AND LESBIAN
INTO GOOGLE IMAGES AND WHAT I
FOUND WAS DEPRAVED.
I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD EARN A
MERIT BADGE IN SCISSORING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO REPUBLICANS, I FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THIS GUY-- 'CUZ I ALSO DID
A SMALL AMOUNT OF WEB-BASED
RESEARCH BY TYPING "BOB MORRIS"
INTO GOOGLE.
AND NOT ONLY IS HE A POLITICIAN,
HE'S AN AUSTRALIAN RACECAR
DRIVER, A MYSTERY WRITER FROM
FLORIDA, A FINANCIER OF THE
AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND AN S&M
CONCEPTUAL ARTIST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT IF BOB MORRIS DOESN'T WORK
OUT, THERE'S ALWAYS NEW
HAMPSHIRE REPRESENTATIVE
KYLE JONES, WHO IS SUCH A FISCAL
CONSERVATIVE, HE'S AS FRUGAL AS
A 20-YEAR-OLD LIVING WITH HIS
PARENTS -- BECAUSE HE IS A
20-YEAR-OLD LIVING WITH HIS
PARENTS.
BUT NOT JUST ANY PARENTS--
KYLE'S MOM LAURA JONES IS ALSO A
STATE REPRESENTATIVE WHICH MEANS
THEY CAN CARPOOL, ALTHOUGH I
BELIEVE KYLE MAKES HER DROP HIM
OFF A BLOCK FROM THE STATEHOUSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EMBARRASSING.
JONES HAS A FIRM GRASP OF THE
LAW.
FOR INSTANCE, HE SUPPORTED THE
REPEAL OF A LAW REQUIRING THAT
STATE WORKERS GET A GUARANTEED
30-MINUTE LUNCH BREAK BY
ARGUING, QUOTE, "IF I WAS TO
DENY ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES A
BREAK, I WOULD BE IN A VERY BAD
POSITION WITH THE COMPANY'S
HUMAN RESOURCES REPRESENTATIVE.
IF YOU CONSIDER THAT THIS IS A
VERY EASY LAW TO FOLLOW IN THAT
EVERYONE ALREADY DOES IT, THEN
WHY DO WE NEED IT?"
EXACTLY!
YOU DON'T NEED THE LAWS THAT
EVERYBODY FOLLOWS!
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T NEED LAWS
AGAINST CANNIBALISM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF I EAT A CO-WORKER, I KNOW I'M
GOING TO HEAR FROM HUMAN
RESOURCES.
CATHY WILL MAKE ME WATCH THAT
BORING CORPORATE VIDEO ABOUT NOT
EATING PEOPLE.
EVEN THOUGH IT'S KINDA FUNNY
BECAUSE IT WAS SHOT IN THE 80S
AND THE CORPSE HAS A PERM.
AND THEN I GOTTA SIGN THE STUPID
FORM AGAIN THAT SAYS, "I
UNDERSTAND THAT CANNIBALISM IS
AGAINST COMPANY POLICY."
SO BRAVO REPRESENTATIVE JONES,
FOR TRYING TO GET RID OF
UNNECESSARY LAWS.
SHOULD YOU MAKE IT INTO THE
WHITE HOUSE, PLEASE STREAMLINE
THE CONSTITUTION IT SHOULD READ
"WE THE PEOPLE... GOT IT,
THANKS."
WE
