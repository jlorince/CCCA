( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, ONE REASON... ONE REASON
FOR OUR... HUGE, HUGE TANK FANS
HERE TONIGHT.
OF COURSE, ONE REASON OUR
BUDGETARY CRISIS IS HERE IS THAT
OUR NATION IS BEING OVERWHELMED
BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
OR TO USE THEIR NATIVE TONGUE, A
SABADO GIGANTE.
AND IT'S COMPOUNDING ANOTHER
RAPIDLY GROWING PROBLEM:
SPIRALING HEALTH CARE COSTS.
BECAUSE -- AND I DID NOT KNOW
THIS -- UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS GET
SICK JUST LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.
AND THEN WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO TO
THE HOSPITAL, WHO IS GOING TO
PAY FOR THAT?
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T.
THE HOSPITAL CAN'T.
AND IT'S HARD TO GO AROUND THE
CORNER FOR A LOTTERY TICKET WHEN
YOU HAVE A CATHETER IN.
FORTUNATELY, AMERICA'S HOSPITALS
HAVE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE THE
BULL BY THE HAIF OWES.
AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S WORD: MEDICAL LEAVE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NATION, WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH
CARE, I BELIEVE IN THE OLD
SAYING, "A HOSPITAL IS NO PLACE
TO BE SICK."
ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
AN UNDOCUMENTED WORKER IN IOWA.
>> IMAGINE GETTING INTO A CAR
CRASH IN RURAL IOWA AND WAKING
UP FROM A COMA IN COASTAL
MEXICO.
IT HAPPENED TO JACINTO CRUZ AND
JOSE RODRIGUEZ-SOLDANA, TWO
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS SERIOUSLY
INJURED IN A WRECK.
THE DES MOINES HOSPITAL SENT
THEM OFF ON A PRIVATE JET TO
THEIR HOMETOWN IN VERA CRUZ.
IOWA METHODIST MEDICAL CENTER
EFFECTIVELY DEPORTED TWO
COMATOSE PATIENTS WITH NO
GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT.
>> Stephen: WELL, DEPORTED IS
SUCH A HARSH WORD.
THE HOSPITAL SIMPLY MOVED THEM
TO THE INTENSIVE "WE DON'T CARE"
UNIT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THIS PROCESS IS CALLED MEDICAL
REPATRIATION.
AND IT'S THE PERFECT ANSWER.
IT'S TOTALLY UNREGULATED.
SO HOSPITALS AVOID ALL THE RED
TAPE USUALLY INVOLVED IN
SHIPPING THE UNCONSCIOUS.
AND DON'T WORRY.
THESE DEPORTATIONS ARE 100%
CONSENSUAL.
YOU SEE, ACCORDING TO A PATIENTS
RIGHTS LAWYER, IN CASES WHERE
THE PATIENT IS UNCONSCIOUS OR
CAN'T COMMUNICATE, RELATIVES ARE
TOLD THEIR LOVED ONE WANTS TO
RETURN.
YES, THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS BUT
DOCTORS HAVE WAYS OF KNOWING
THIS STUFF.
NOW NATURALLY, MEDICAL
REPATRIATION HAS THE
BLEEDING-HEART LABOR LOVERS OUT
THERE SAYING THE PRACTICE
VIOLATES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL
LAWS AND UNFAIRLY TARGETS ONE OF
THE NATION'S MOST DEFENSELESS
POPULATIONS.
UNFAIRLY TARGETS?
I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD UNFAIRLY
TARGET ME WITH A FREE RIDE ON A
PRIVATE JET.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE HIGH LIFE.
IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME... CHEERS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME I HAVE A
COUPLE OF WEEKS OFF I'M GOING TO
GO STRAIGHT TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM, TELL THE ADMITTING NURSE
THAT I'M AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WHO
WAS BORN IN THE PLAYA FIESTA
BEACH CLUB AND HOTEL IN PUERTA
VALLARTA AND THEN BASH MY MYSELF
IN THE SKULL WITH A HAMMER.
WHEN I WAKE UP, I'LL HAVE BED
SORES IN PARADISE.
UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, NOT ALL
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE IN COMAS.
NOW THERE'S AN OBVIOUS FIX FOR
THAT.
BUT I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO GET
IN YOUR CAR AND MOW DOWN
EVERYONE YOU SUSPECT OF BEING ON
TEAM SHAKIRA.
AND WE CAN USE THIS CONCEPT OF
JUST SHIPPING OFF OUR HEALTH
CARE EXPENSES ON OTHER THINGS.
FOR INSTANCE, THE THINGS WE'RE
ALREADY USING IT ON.
>> SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS INTO
PATIENT DUMPING.
LAS VEGAS HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE
ACCUSED TONIGHT OF SHIPPING
PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS WITH A
ONE-WAY TICKET ON GREYHOUND
BUSES TO LOS ANGELES, SAN
FRANCISCO AND OTHER CALIFORNIA
CITIES.
>> Stephen: HEY, WHAT HAPPENS IN
VEGAS, STAYS IN VEGAS.
UNLESS WHAT HAPPENS IS
PSYCHOSIS.
NOW, FOLKS, ONE PSYCHIATRIC
HOSPITAL, ONE HOSPITAL IS
ACCUSED OF SHIPPING MORE THAN
1500 PATIENTS ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.
BUT THEY'RE NOT JUST ABANDONING
THEM.
AS ONE PATIENT SENT TO
SACRAMENTO EXPLAINED HE WAS
GIVEN A THREE-DAY SUPPLY OF
MEDICATION AND TOLD TO CALL 911
WHEN HE ARRIVED.
WE COULD SAVE EVEN MORE MONEY IF
WE GAVE THEM A THREE-DAY SUPPLY
OF RAISINETS AND TOLD THEM TO
CALL MOVIEFONE.
OF COURSE, SOME CITIES MIGHT NOT
LIKE HAVING PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS
DUMPED ON THEIR DOORSTEP.
EASY FIX: DON'T LET THEM OFF THE
BUS.
WE'LL HAVE A NATIONWIDE ROTATING
CARAVAN OF BUSES FILLED WITH THE
MENTALLY ILL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I THINK THIS "OUT OF
SIGHT OUT OF MIND" STRATEGY CAN
SAVE MONEY ON ALL OUR SOCIAL
PROBLEMS.
LET'S END POVERTY BY FLYING THE
POOR TO SUB SAHARAN AFRICA.
OR WE COULD STRAP THE ELDERLY TO
ROCKETS AND SHOOT THEM INTO
SPACE.
OR MAYBE WE COULD SEND THE
UNEMPLOYED SOME PLACE I'LL NEVER
COME BACK FROM.
BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE DON'T TURN
A BLIND EYE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR
FELLOW MAN.
SO WE NEED TO SEND THEM SOME
PLACE WHERE WE CAN'T SEE THEM AT
ALL.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
