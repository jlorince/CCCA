GOVERNOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU,
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
>> A FEDERALIST, HUH.
>> Stephen: WELL, I DON'T
KNOW.
YOU WERE A DEMOCRAT THEN YOU
BECAME A REPUBLICAN.
>> I CAN SEE LIKE LINCOLN, A
WIG, DINNER REPUBLICAN.
YOU HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE,
STEVE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT,
SPEAKING OF FLEXIBLE WE HAVE
A COUPLE ISSUES TO DEAL WITH
BEFORE WE START THE
INTERVIEW.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A FEDERAL
SUPERPAC.
AND MY LAWYER TREVOR POTTER
WHO TURNS OUT IS ALSO YOUR
LAWYER TREVOR POTTER HAS
WARNED US THAT I CAN IN NO
WAY COORDINATE WITH YOU.
I CAN'T DISCUSS YOUR
CAMPAIGN PLANS PRORX SWREKTS,
ACTIVITIES OR FEEDS SO NO
ONE CAN ACCUSE US OF WORKING
TOGETHER.
I MAY BE A HIGH PRICED CALL
GIRL BUT I'M NOT OFFERING MY
SERVICES.
GOT IT?
>> THE DEEPER THE PLOT THE
MORE HE LASH RATE THE RULES
BUT WE'LL FOLLOW THEM.
>> Stephen: THE AUDIENCE MAY
WANT TO KNOW SOME OF YOUR
IDEAS ABOUT HOW YOU PLAN TO
RUN IN IOWA OR ELSEWHERE.
I CAN'T KNOW ABOUT THEM.
IF AT SOME POINT YOU START
TALKING ABOUT THEM I'LL PUT
ON THE CONE OF SILENCE.
OKAY.
>> SOUNDS GOOD.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU'RE A
FOUR TERM CONGRESSMAN,
FORMER GOVERNOR OF
LOUISIANA.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY DOW WANT TO
RUN FOR PRESIDENT?
DO YOU JUST THINK THE
COUNTRY IS IN SUCH GREAT
SHAPE, LET ME GET THE REIGN?
(LAUGHTER)
>> ALL MY LIFE I HAVE
STUDIED ECONOMICS AND
HISTORY AND PROUD TO BE AN
AMERICAN.
I THINK OUR COUNTRY'S IN
TROUBLE.
WE'RE GIVING OUR JOBS AWAY.
AND SPECIAL INTEREST ON
WASHINGTON D.C.
WHAT I HAVE DONE TO CONTROL
THE MONEY IS DECIDE TO TAKE
NO PAC MONEY, ESPECIALLY
YOURS.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
NO PAC MONEY.
>> I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE
RUNNING THAT IS THE SAME WAY
I RAN FOR CONGRESS.
THAT'S THE SAME WAY I RAN
FOR GOVERNOR.
I TAKE NO PAC MONEY.
A HUNDRED DOLLAR LIMIT AND
FULL DISCLOSURE.
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
>> A HUNDRED DOLLAR LIMIT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THE SUPREME COURT SAID IN
CITIZENS UNITED THAT MONEY
IS SPEECH.
AND BY ONLY TAKING $100 ARE
YOU SAYING TO YOUR FOLLOWERS,
SHHH I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.
OKAY, DADDY'S BUSY.
STOP TALKING.
>> MONEY IS SPEECH.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS
IT.
BUT I HAVE THE GOD GIVEN AND
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS TO
WHO I LISTEN TO.
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THE
SPECIAL INTERESTS WITH THE
BIG CHECKS.
I WILL LISTEN--
(APPLAUSE)
I WILL LISTEN TO AMERICANS
WITH $100, $5 OR ZERO
DOLLARS WHO HAVE AN IDEA
ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A BETTER
COUNTRY.
I WILL NOT PUT UP WITH THE
SPECIAL INTERESTS.
I CALL THEM HOGS IN THE TROV
AND WE'RE GOING TO KICK THEM
OUT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
HOGS IN THE TROUGH.
I HAPPEN TO LOVE THE TASTE
OF BACON AND THEY'RE WELCOME
TO MY TR ROCK UGH ANY TIME.
OKAY WHAT WOULD A PRESIDENT
BUDDY, AND I HAVE TO SAY,
THAT'S GOT A RING TO IT WHAT
DOES A PRESIDENT BUDDY DO
ABOUT THE DEBT CEILING?
DO YOU LET IT LAPS?
>> NO, YOU MEET YOUR
OBLIGATIONS.
I MEAN THE PRESIDENT OUGHT
TO TELL THE WORLD THAT WE'RE
GOING TO MEET OUR
OBLIGATIONS.
AND HE NEEDS TO LEAD.
ONE OF THE JOBS OF A
PRESIDENT IS TO PROTECT
AMERICA, INCLUDING ITS
WORKFORCE.
AND WE ARE GETTING BEAT UP
BY UNFAIR TRADE.
YOU KNOW THAT.
>> Stephen: I DO KNOW THAT.
SOMETIMES I DO TEN SHOWS A
WEEK, FOUR OF THEM BROADCAST,
THE OTHER SIX SHIPPED OVER
TO INDIA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE
BREAK.
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE.
GOVERNOR BUDDY ROEMER
