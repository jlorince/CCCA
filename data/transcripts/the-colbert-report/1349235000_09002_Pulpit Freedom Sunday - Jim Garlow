POPEMOBILE CHASE.
(LAUGHTER) PASTOR JIM GARLOW, ONE OF THE LEADERS BEHIND FREEDOM SUNDAY SAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT PRINCIPLE.
>> WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE NO GOVERNMENTAL INTRUSION IN THE PULPIT AT ALL.
A PASTOR SHOULD BE-- IF HE WANTS TO ENDORSE OR A OPPOSE A CANDIDATE.
AND THAT SHOULD BE THE RIGHT OF THE PASTOR BASED UPON THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
NO GOVERNMENTAL INTRUSION INTO THE PULPIT.
>> I DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT PROTECTING ME FROM SPEECH, I AM A MATURE FREE-THINKING AMERICAN
CAPABLE OF MAKING MY OWN RATIONAL DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CANDIDATE MY PRIEST SAID GOT WANTS KNOW PICK.
(LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, IT SHOULD NOT STOP THERE, I WANT MY RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO WEIGH IN ON EVERYTHING.
JUDICIAL RACES, SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS, BOND ISSUES, THE BALLOT INITIATIVE CREATING A DEDICATED TRAFFIC SIGNAL IN THE
LEFT TURN LANE IN FRONT OF THE ARBY'S BECAUSE LO HAVING TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MAPLE, MAKE A RIGHT AND THEN TAKE THAT ROUND
ABOUT JUST TO GET BACK TO THE DRIVE THROUGH DOTH MAKE THE ANGELS WEEP.
I MEAN, CAN I GET AN AMEN?
(AUDIENCE REACTS) HERE TO GIVE ME ANOTHER AMEN-- MAYBE AS GOOD AS THAT ONE-- IS ONE OF THE BOLD LEADERS OF
PULPIT FREEDOM SUNDAY, A MAN WITH THE PARABLES AND THE PAIR OF BALLS.
PASTOR JIM GARLOW.
PASTOR JIM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS?
>> THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR.
>> Stephen: SO YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BASICALLY TRYING TO POKE THE HORNET'S NEST OF THE I.R.S.
FOR FIVE YEARS SO THEY'LL TAKE YOU TO COURT OVER THE THIS UNJUST LAW.
WHY HAVEN'T THEY DONE IT YET?
>> I ASSUME THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE.
WE HAD THAT PRIVILEGE FOR 166 YEARS IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY 58 YEARS AGO AND OUR LINE WAS SIMPLE: NO
GOVERNMENTAL INTRUSION INTO THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH AT ALL.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CHURCH HAS GOING FOR THEM RIGHT NOW.
WHICH I REALLY LOVE.
YOU'VE GOT THIS TAX-FREE THING GOING ON.
(LAUGHTER) CAN I GET IN ON THAT?
BECAUSE-- (LAUGHTER) I'VE GOT A SUPER PAC BUT DONATIONS TO ME ARE NOT TAX DEDUCTIONS AND AND OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE TO USE AFTERTAX MONEY FOR THEIR POLITICAL SPEECH.
BUT YOU GUYS GET TO USE PRE-TAX MONEY FOR POLITICAL SPEECH.
I'D LOVE TO HAVE MY POLITICAL SPEECH SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM TAKE THAT UP WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN SEPARATION OF
CHURCH AND STATE AND NO GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL AND THE SUPREME COURT WOULD LATER RULE IF THE GOVERNMENT TAXES THE
CHURCH IT THEREBY CAN CONTROL AND DESTROY ANYTHING THAT IT TAXES AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION IS THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR.
>> Stephen: SO SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE I'VE NEVER BEEN A BIG FAN OF.
I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD PREACH YOUR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WHEN YOU ADVISE PEOPLE HOW TO VOTE.
DO YOU AGREE?
>> Stephen: YES.
>> OKAY, I'M GLAD I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED MITT ROMNEY BECAUSE IT'S IN CONFLICT WITH MY CATHOLIC FACE BECAUSE I KNOW
HE'S A MEMBER OF A CULT, OKAY?
(LAUGHTER) BUT NOW NOW I'M FREE TO EXERCISE MY CATHOLIC BELIEF THAT HE'S AN APOSTATE HERETIC WHO SHOULD NOT
HOLD THE HIGH FEST JOB IN THE LAND IN GOD'S CHOSEN COUNTRY.
DO YOU BELIEVE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREACH THAT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO.
IF YOU'RE A PREACHER--.
>> Stephen: HOW AM I NOT A PREACHER?
THIS IS MY CONGREGATION (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IT'S A GREAT CONGREGATION.
>> Stephen: YOU SHOULD SEE WHEN I PASS THE HAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHETHER A PASTOR IS CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL HE OUGHT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT IN HIS PULPIT, PERIOD.
>> Stephen: LIKE THAT BECAUSE--
>> OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO HAVE PULPIT POLICE IN EVERY CHURCH MONITORING THEIR SPEECH.
>> Stephen: I DO BELIEVE THAT PREACHERS OR PRIESTS OR RELIGIOUS LEADERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT
BECAUSE FREE SPEECH SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE AND I BELIEVE THAT.
ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE IT IS THAT I DON'T THINK, A, THERE'S ENOUGH RELIGION IN OUR POLITICS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE'S NOT
ENOUGH POLITICS IN OUR RELIGION.
I KNOW NOW IF A PREACHER SAYS VOTE FOR X CANDIDATE OR Y CANDIDATE AND THAT CANDIDATE LOSES I KNOW I'VE GOT A LOSER
GOD, STOCK?
(LAUGHTER) OR IF THAT CANDIDATE TURNS OUT TO BE CORRUPT I KNOW MY GOD WAS FALSE AND I CAN MOVE ON TO A NEW ONE.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT GETTING POLITICS ALL OVER RELIGION IS THAT WE CAN GET THAT KIND OF
ACRIMONY AND THAT HATE TOWARD EACH OTHER OVER OUR RELIGIONS IN A FRESH WAY?
(LAUGHTER) LAUGH.
>>.
>>
>> YOUR GOD IS PROBABLY JUST FINE, MAYBE YOU HAD A LOSER PREACHER.
THE PASTOR OUGHT TO SAY WHAT HE WANTS.
WE'RE NOT SAYING A PASTOR HAS TO ENDORSE WE'RE SAYING HE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT RIGHT IF HE WANTS TO.
>> Stephen: WHO ARE YOU ENDORSING?
>> NOT ANYBODY ON THIS SHOW.
>> Stephen: HEY!
>> I WILL IN MY PULPIT THIS SUNDAY.
>> GIVE ME A HINT.
>> Stephen:
>> I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO BE A GUEST IN MY PULPIT AND SPEAK IN MY CHURCH IN SAN DIEGO.
WILL YOU COME?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I'M ON A BOOK TOUR RIGHT NOW B. CAN I TAKE A RAIN CHECK?
DR. JIM GARLOW, SENIOR PASTOR AT SKYLINE WESLEY JANUARY CHURCH.
