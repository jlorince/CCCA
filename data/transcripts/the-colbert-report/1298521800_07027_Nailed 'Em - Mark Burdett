[LAUGHTER]
NATION, I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR
WEEKS, THE WORLD IS SPINNING OUT

THE MIDDLE EAST, MADISON,
WISCONSIN, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE WHOLE WORLD.
[LAUGHTER]
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK RADICAL
ELEMENTS ARE BENT ON DESTROYING
THE ESTABLISHED ORDER AND THE
RULE OF LAW.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHORITIES
JUST CANNOT REGAIN CONTROL.
TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

STIRRING STORY OF CHAI KWROES IN
OUR -- CHAOS IN OUR STREETS
GETTING RUN DOWN BY THE
HEADLIGHTS OF JUSTICE.
THIS IS NAILED 'EM.

>> I'M AN INDEPENDENT
JOURNALIST, MEDIA ACTIVIST AND
WEB DEVELOPER.
>> Stephen: LIKE I SEDAN
ARREST CHIFT, AND -- LIKE I
SAID, ANARCHIST WHO GOT NAILED
IN SAN FRANCISCO.
WITH HIS POLICE ISSUED PRESS
PASS AROUND HIS NECK MARK WAS
VIDEO TAPING THE PROTEST WHEN
THINGS GOT SO AND -- ANARCHY-Y
THAT THINGS GOT OUT OF CONTROL.
>> POLICE BROKE THE ARM.
>> Stephen: HE STARTED ANARC
ANARCHYING IT UP.
>> POLICE CORRALLED THEM AND ARE
ARRESTED THEM -- ARRESTING THEM.
AT THAT POINT ONE RAN BY AND
TPH-BGD OVER A POLICE MOTORCYCLE
NEXT TO ME.
>> Stephen: THAT WAS THE SOUND
OF A POLICE MOTORCYCLE CRASH
TOGETHER GROUND.
LET'S HEAR IT AGAIN.
AND THIS IS THE LAST THING AN
ANARCHIST WANTS TO SEE AFTER A
POLICEMAN'S MOTORCYCLE GETS
KNOCKED TO THE GROUND.
>> I DIDN'T DO THAT.
I DIDN'T DO THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT IS THE SOUND
OF AN ANARCHIST SQUEALING LIKE A
FRIGHTENED LITTLE GIRL.
>> THE POLICE GRABBED ME AND
THROUGH ME ON TO THE GROUND
BRUTALLY AND BENT MY THUMB
BACKWARDS UNTIL IT FRACTURED.
>> Stephen: THE USE OF FORCE
WAS CLEARLY JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE
SEVERITY OF HIS CRIME.
>> THEY CHARGED ME WITH
JAYWALKING.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT
JAYWALKING IN THE FIRST DEGREE.
>> IT'S ILLEGAL.
>> Stephen: ROD IS A FIVE YEAR
VETERAN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO
CROSSING GUARD SQUAD.
>> COME ON.

GLOVE, THE DAYGLO VEST.
HE OWNS HIS OWN STOP SIEFNL HE
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS IF ANARCHISTS
LIKE MARK AREN'T NAILED.
>> JAYWALKING KILLS.
>> Stephen: BUT MARK DOESN'T
CARE.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD
REALLY BELIEVE I WAS JAYWALKING.

THIS SURE LOOKS LIKE MARK
FLAGRANTLY JAYWALKING AWAY FROM
THE ANGRY COP WITH THE CLUB.
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED WHAT THAT
DOES.
>> JAYWALKING KILLS.
>> Stephen: I BELIEVE THIS
LEGAL DOCUMENT DOESN'T SAY HE
WAS JAYWALKING.
LEGAL DOCUMENT.
OF COURSE LEGAL DOCUMENTS MEAN
NOTHING TO AN ANARCHIST.
FOR MARK THIS IS JUST PART OF A
LONG PATTERN OF AMBULATORY
TRANSGRESSIONS.
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
PATTERN HERE.
>> Stephen: WE FOUND SOMEONE
WHO WEGS TO DIFFERENT.
MARK'S MOTHER.
>> WHEN MARK OF FOUR YEARS OLD
OUR FAMILY WENT TO VISIT THE
TOMB OF UNKNOWN SOLDIER IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
WE'RE STANDING WAITING FOR THE
GUARD.
HE STEPPED INTO THE AREA WHERE
THE ROPE WAS.
THE GUARD PUT HIS RIFLE AT THE
READY AND HOLLERED AT OUR
FAMILY, HALT, STEP BACK.
>> Stephen: AS A FOUR-YEAR-OLD
MARK FORCED AN ARMED SOLDIER TO
POINT A RIFLE AT HIS OWN MOTHER
PROVING ONCE AGAIN:

LIVES ON THE LINE, WHY DIDN'T
