WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, IT'S NEVER BEEN EASY FOR
A CONSERVATIVE LIKE ME TO LIVE
IN NEW YORK.
IT'S THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE
LIBERAL AGENDA, FROM PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION TO LEGALIZED
BROADWAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THINGS ARE ONLY GETTING
WORSE, THANKS TO DEMOCRAT
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO WHO HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL NOT
APPROVE A RAISE FOR STATE
LAWMAKERS UNTIL THEY
DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, I'VE SEEN STONERS TRY TO
TURN A LOT OF THINGS INTO BONGS,
BUT NEVER AN ENTIRE STATEHOUSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, MARIJUANA USERS MOVE ON
TO HARDER STUFF LIKE WEED,
GRASS, GANJA, YAY-MAN, OPTIMUS
PRIME-LEAF, DUTCH ARUGULA,
GROMP, ZUFF, CHONK, NOOP, AND
MEXICAN LUNG CONFETTI.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I MADE HALF OF THOSE UP.
PLUS, POT CAN MAKE YOU PARANOID.
YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU,
[ LAUGHTER ]
SITTING THERE RIGHT NOW WATCHING
THE SHOW WITH YOUR PARENTS.
THEY KNOW-- WE ALL KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, PUFF THE MAGIC GOVERNOR
IS THREATENING THEIR RAISES
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO CHANGE A
QUIRK IN THE STATE'S MARIJUANA
LAWS WHERE IF YOU POSSESS POT
IT'S ONLY A TICKET.
BUT IF IT'S IN PUBLIC VIEW, SAY
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN STOPPED AND
FRISKED BY POLICE, THEN IT'S A
CRIME.
>> HE SAYS THE AIM IS TO AVOID
UNNECESSARY CHARGES AGAINST
THOUSANDS OF NEW YORKERS WHO HE
SAYS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY
BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUTH.
>> STEPHEN: OH, I SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE.
WHAT IF WE LIKE -- (bleep).
NO, NO, NO, NO!
WHAT IF, LIKE, WE LIVED IN A
WORLD WHERE OUR POLICE RESOURCES
WERE ALLOCATED MORE EFFECTIVELY,
AND DIDN'T REFLECT THE ENDEMIC
RACISM OF THE SYSTEM, MAN?
GROW UP, BURNOUT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CLEARLY, THIS WHOLE
"DISPROPORTIONATE TARGETING OF
MINORITIES" BOONDOGGLE IS JUST A
FIG LEAF SO CUOMO CAN EXERCISE
HIS DOOBERNATORIAL POWERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD
EXPLANATION FOR WHY NEW YORK
POLICE OFFICERS ARE STOPPING AND
FRISKING SO MANY YOUNG
MINORITIES IN POOR
NEIGHBORHOODS: BECAUSE ALL THE
WHITE KIDS IN WEALTHIER
NEIGHBORHOODS AREN'T CARRYING
WEED.
THEY'VE MOVED ON TO COKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO MAYBE INSTEAD OF TURNING THIS
STATE INTO GOVERNOR MAGORIUM'S
GANJA EMPORIUM, CUOMO COULD
REALLY HELP THESE KIDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE COULD TELL THEM TO PUT DOWN
THE POT, AND FOCUS ON THEIR
LIVES: THEIR CRUMBLING SCHOOLS,
AND THEIR COMMUNITY'S HOSTILE
TREATMENT BY THE POLICE.
AND IF THAT UPSETS THEM AND THEY
NEED TO RELAX, THEY CAN GET A
PRESCRIPTION FOR XANAX.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE REMEMBER: DRUGS ARE NOT
THE ANSWER, KIDS-- EXCEPT WHEN
THEY ARE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
