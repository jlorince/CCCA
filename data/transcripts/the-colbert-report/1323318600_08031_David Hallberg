EVERYBODY.
TONIGHT MY GUEST IS FIRST
AMERICAN TO JOIN RUSSIA'S
BALLET.
LY MAKE SURE HE STAYS ON POINT.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID HALBERG.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
GET YOUR DEFENSES UP BECAUSE I'M
GOING THE LAY INTO YOU RIGHT
NOW.
OKAY.
AMERICANS DON'T DEFECT TO GO TO
THE BOLSHOI.
THE RUSSKIES DEFECT TO COME
HERE.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING THE LOSE US
THE COLD WAR?
>> STEPHEN, THE COLD WAR IS
OVER.
>> Stephen: IT WAS UNTIL YOU
DID THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN YOU HANDED THEM A VICTORY.
WHY DANCE FOR THE BOLSHOI?
>> YOU KNOW, I LOVE CHALLENGE.
I LOVE RISK.
>> Stephen: THERE'S NOTHING
RISKY OR CHALLENGE IN THE UNITED
STATES?
YOU WANT RISK, DANCE ON FIRE.
I'D GO SEE THAT.
DO THE FIREBIRD ON FIRE.
>> STEPHEN, FOR ME IT WAS REALLY
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE
SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND
RUSSIANS DON'T DEFECT ANYMORE,
AND AMERICANS OBVIOUSLY DON'T
DEFECT, SO I SAW REALLY AN
OPPORTUNITY, AND SOMEONE THAT...
NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE.
I'M REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO
HAVE DONE THIS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, NO ONE HAS
BEEN THIS MUCH OF A TRAITOR TO
THE UNITED STATES.
OKAY.
YOU ARE BENEDICT ARNOLD IN
SLIGHTLY TIGHTER PANTS.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
WHY NOT DANCE IN AN AMERICAN
COMPANY?
>> I AM CERTAINLY WITH AN
AMERICAN COMPANY.
>> WHO ARE YOU WITH?
>> AMERICAN BALLET THEATER IN
NEW YORK CITY.
I HAVE BEEN WITH THEM FOR TEN
YEARS.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE WITH THE
AMERICAN BALLET THEATER AND THE
BOLSHOI AT THE SAME TIME?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE A DOUBLE
AGENT.
YOU'RE GIVING AWAY ALL OF OUR
BALLET SECRETS.
>> THERE ARE AMERICAN BALLET
SECRETS.
AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THEM WITH
RUSSIANS.
THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN
UNBELIEVABLY ACCOMMODATING.
THEY'VE BEEN SO WELCOMING, SO
WARM.
I WAS KWAI SURPRISED.
>> Stephen: DID YOU MEET
VLADIMIR PUTIN?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: I BET HE'S A GOOD
DANCER.
HE CAN DO EVERYTHING.
HE CAN SCUBA DIVE, HE CAN KILL
TIGERS.
HE CAN DO IT ALL.
>> THE BOLSHOI IS VERY MUCH PART
OF THE CULTURE THERE, AND
POLITICAL DIGNITARIES ARE AT THE
BALLET ALL THE TIME.
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET
A COUPLE OF THEM BUT NOT PUTIN
YET.
>> Stephen: LET'S GET DOWN TO
YOUR ORIGINS HERE.
YOU WERE BORN IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
>> BORN IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
>> Stephen: GREW UP IN
ARIZONA.
>> GREW UP IN PHOENIX, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S A GUY IN
SOUTH DAKOTA AND ARIZONA DOING
BALLET?
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING THE
BOOT-SCOOTING LIE DANCE AND
EATING A CHILI DOG?
>> FIRST I SAW FRED ASTAIRE ON
TV.
HE WAS MY MAIN INSPIRATION.
I WAS OBSESSED WITH HIM AND WHAT
HE DID.
HE WAS UNBELIEVABLY ON THE
SILVER SCREEN, SECONDLY, AS AN
ARTIST, THERE IS THIS CALLING
THAT EVERYONE SPEAK UP WHEN YOU
HAVE... WHEN YOU LOVE WHAT YOU
DO, AND FOR ME THAT IS DANCE.
AS AN ARTIST I HAD THIS NATURAL
CALLING.
I WAS NEVER PUSHED IN BALLET,
FORCED TO BE IN BALLET.
IT WAS MY OWN DEDICATION, MY OWN
OBSESSION REALLY.
AND THAT'S TRUE EVEN TO TODAY.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT DANCE AND
OBSESSION.
I SAW THAT MOVIE THE "BLACK
SWAN."
DID YOU SEE THAT MOVIE?
>> OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: IS THAT TRUE?
ARE ALL YOU GUYS CRAZY?
DO YOU HAVE VISIONS YOU HAVE
FEATHERS COMING OUT OF YOUR BODY
ALL THE TIME?
>> IF THE MOVIE GOT ANYTHING
RIGHT, IT'S THE FACT THAT WE ARE
CRAZY AND DEDICATED FOR OUR ART
FORM.
>> Stephen: ALSO IN THAT MOVIE
THEY ARE LIKE HUMPING 24/7.
OKAY.
DID THEY GET THAT RIGHT?
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IN THE MOVIE...
>> Stephen: LET'S STOP RIGHT
THERE.
THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW.
IT'S FAMILY SHOW.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A
PERFORMANCE BY THE BOLSHOI
BALLET'S D
