ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE KING MAYOROF ECONOMICS RIGHT NOW.
YOU GOT THIS NEW BOOK CALLEDCAPITAL IN THE 21st CENTURY.
WHY ARE YOU TRYINGTO TEAR DOWN THE WESTERN
ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND REPLACEIT WITH SOCIALIST
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH?
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO DO THAT.
>> YOUR ACCENT SOUNDS LIKEYOU ARE.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, I
TURNED 18 WHEN THE BERLINWALL FELL, SO I HAVE NEVER HAD
AN INTEREST IN COMMUNISM. I AMJUST TRYING TO SEE HOW WE CAN
ENSURE THAT EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM
GLOBALIZATION.
>> BENEFITS HOW, LIKE TAKEMY MONEY AND GIVE IT TO A
POOR PERSON.
>> NO, NO.
(LAUGHTER)>> HOW DO WE BENEFIT
EVERYBODY.
>> WE WANT ALL TO HAVEACCESS TO EDUCATION, GOOD
PAYING JOBS.
RIGHT NOW THE MINIMUM WAGEIN THIS COUNTRY IS LOWER THAN
IT WAS IN THE 60s.
WHICH IS HALF A CENTURY AGO AND
MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE BESTWE CAN DO.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU CANMULTIPLY IT BY THREE BUT HALF A
CENTURY IS A BIT LONG FORSTAGNATION
>> MAYBE WE SHOULD INSTEAD OFTRIPLE IT MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
DOUBLE IT AND WORK 30 HOURWORKWEEKS LIKE THEY DO OVER
IN PARIS, RIGHT, THEN THEFARMERS CAN BRING THEIR
TRACTORS IN AND STOP THETRAFFIC AND WE'LL ALL TAKE
TWO MONTHS OFF IN THESUMMERTIME AND HAVE MISTRESSES
MAYBE THAT'S-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU KNOW, YET IN EUROPE,MANY BELIEVE THAT ONE OF
THE PURPOSES OF CIVILIZATION  ISTO WORK LESS, HAVE MORE VACATION
AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR FRIENDSAND FAMILY BUT YOU CAN MAKE A
DIFFERENT CHOICE AND THAT'SFINE.
>> YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENTCHOICE.
YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENTCHOICE AND BE A WORLD
SUPERPOWER, OKAY.
UNITED STATES SITTING ON TOPOF THE PILE HERE.
DON'T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TOHAVE OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM

SO HOW IS-- LET'S TALK ABOUT RIS GREATER THAN G. HOW DOES THAT
AFFECT SAY MEMBERS MOVE MYAUDIENCE, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN,
WHAT DOES R IS GREATER THAN GHOW DOES THAT AFFECT OUR LIVES.
>> IF YOUR WAGE IS STAGNATING TMEANS THAT YOUR G IS CLOSE TO
ZERO. YOU HAVE NO GROWTH SOIT'S STAGNANT AND SO IT IS
DIFFICULT TO START ACCUMULATINGWEALTH FROM NOTHING. WHEREAS IF
YOU START WITH SOME INITIALWEALTH IT MAKES IT EASIER --
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOURARGUMENT IS THAT CAPITALISM
BENEFITS CAPITALISTS.
>> WELL, WHEN YOU HAVE ALOW-GROWTH RATE THEN INDEED
IT BENEFITS OWNERS MORE THANIT OUGHT TO.
>> WAIT A SECOND.
WHO GETS TO SAY HOW MUCH ITOUGHT TO.
I'M THE ONE THAT TOOK THERISK.
I'M THE JOB CREATOR.
>> RIGHT, ARE YOU THE JOBCREATOR BUT YOU WANT MOBILITY,
AND NEW GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO BEABLE TO ENTER THE ECONOMIC GAME.
INEQUALITY IS FINE UP TO A POINTBUT IF IT GETS TOO EXTREME IT'S
NOT GOOD YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOODBECAUSE YOU SOME MOBILITY IN
SOCIETY -->> LET'S TAKE THAT FOR A
SECOND.

CONVERSATION, DO NOT APPLAUDMY FACIAL HAIR WHILE THE MAN
IS TALKING.
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THATIDEA.
THAT YOU WANT MOBILITY.
YOU WANT MOBILITY.
INEQUALITY IS BAD BECAUSEYOU WANT MOBILITY.
BUT IF I AM ALREADY MOBILEDUP TO THE PLACE I WANT TO BE,
ISN'T IT BETTER FOR ME TOPULL UP THE LADDER BEHIND
ME.
AND IT MAKES THINGS BETTERBECAUSE THEN I CAN BE
CHARITABLE WITH MONEY THAT IDON'T EVEN MISS TO ALL THE
POOR PEOPLE I CAN EASILYFIND.
>> NO, IT IS BETTER TO CHOOSEYOUR TAX RATE THAN LET OTHERS
CHOOSE IT>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU
>> OF COURSE.
>> IN FACT, THIS COUNTRYINVENTED PROGRESSIVE TAXATION OF
INCOME AND INHERITED WEALTH.
AND SOMEHOW WE'VE FORGOTTEN THATSINCE THE 1980s BECAUSE THE
COUNTRY HAS MOVED IN ACOMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
>> BECAUSE REAGAN CAME INAND IT WAS MORNING IN
AMERICA.
>> IT WAS MORNING IN AMERICAEXCEPT THAT THE GROWTH
PERFORMANCE OF AMERICA WASACTUALLY BETTER IN THE 50s 60s
AND 70s THAN IN THE 1980s. SO IFYOU LOOK AT THE PAST 30 YEARS
YOU HAVE RISING INEQUALITYEVERYWHERE
EXCEPT IN THE GROWTH STATISTICS.
IF YOU TAKE THE GROWTHPERFORMANCE OF THE U.S. OVER THE
PAST 30 YEARS, YOU HAVE 1.5PERCENT GROWTH RATE.
SO YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO THETOP PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
>> THIS IS NOT A GOOD DEALFOR THE REST OF THE
POPULATION.
