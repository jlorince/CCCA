(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYSURPRISE.
I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK ANY NEWSHERE WHEN I SAY I CONSIDER
MYSELF A POSITIVE GUY.
BUT NOW A RECENT STUDY HAS MADEME SAD ABOUT BEING SO HAPPY,
BECAUSE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUNDTHAT PEOPLE WITH PESSIMISTIC
VIEWS OF THE FUTURE WERE MORELIKELY TO LIVE
LONGER AND HEALTHIER LIVES
THAN THOSE WITH A ROSIEROUTLOOK.
THAT'S RIGHT, NEGATIVE NELLIESLIVE LONGER --
A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THEMCCAIN EFFECT.
THE REASON, RESEARCHERS SAY, ISTHAT THOSE WHO ARE DEFENSIVELY
PESSIMISTIC MAY BE MORE LIKELYTO INVEST IN PREPARATORY OR
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES.
FOR INSTANCE, A MAN WHO ALWAYSINSISTS ON WEARING PROTECTION IS
LESS LIKELY TO GET A GIRLPREGNANT.
JUST LIKE A MAN WHO ALWAYSINSISTS ON WEARING A PARACHUTE
IS ALSO LESS LIKELY TO GET AGIRL PREGNANT.
(LAUGHTER)THE SAME REPORT HAD BAD NEWS FOR
HAPPY PEOPLE.
DR. DILIP JESTE EXPLAINS.
>> EXCESSIVE OR OVER-CONFIDENCECAN CREATE PROBLEMS.
IT MAY PRODUCE FEELINGS OFINVINCIBILITY, AND THAT COULD
RESULT IN UNNECESSARYRISK-TAKING.
FOR EXAMPLE, TEENAGERS ORYOUNGSTERS MAY START DRINKING,
SMOKING, USING SUBSTANCES.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT,OPTIMISM COULD LEAD TEENAGERS TO
DRINK, SMOKE OR USE DRUGS.
WHEREAS PESSIMISM COULD CAUSETHEM TO ALSO DO THAT.
(LAUGHTER)AND IT'S NOT JUST TEENS --
RESEARCHERS REPORTED THATSUBJECTS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED AS
MOST OPTIMISTIC AS CHILDREN WERETHE ONES WHO DIED THE SOONEST.
OKAY.
THAT FINDING REALLY MAKES MEDEPRESSED.
(LAUGHTER)THOUGH PROBABLY NOT AS DEPRESSED
AS THE SCIENTIST WHOSE JOB ITWAS TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF HAPPY
CHILDREN WHO DIED.
(LAUGHTER)HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.
THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ATUNIVERSITY OF ERLANGEN-NURNBERG
USING DATA FROM A NATIONALLYREPRESENTATIVE SURVEY IN
GERMANY.
YES, GERMANY.
LAND OF NIETZSCHE, GOETHE ANDSAUERKRAUT, THE CONDIMENT THAT
TASTES THE MOST LIKE HUMANTEARS.
(LAUGHTER)LUCKY FOR ME, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
ONE OF THE GERMANS WHOPARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY.
PLEASE WELL COME FRIEND OF THESHOW AND GERMANY'S AMBASSADOR TO
THE U.N., THE HONORABLE HANSBEINHOLTZ.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

>> HANS:  GLAD TO BE HERE.
I HAD FEARED OUR NEXT MEETINGWOULD BE AT MY FUNERAL.
(LAUGHTER)>> >> STEPHEN: COME ON, HANS,
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF GREAT YEARSAHEAD OF YOU.
>> HANS:  TIME IS A CRUELINVENTION TO CREATE THE ILLUSION
OF GROWTH.
IN TRUTH, THE MOMENT WE ARE BORNIS THE MOMENT WE BEGIN TO DIE.
>> STEPHEN: DON'T FOCUS ON THENEGATIVES.
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.
>> HANS:  NOT SHORT ENOUGH.
LIFE IS A NOOSE WITH KILOMETERSOF SLACK, TEASING US WITH THE
PROMISE OF RELEASE.
AND YET HERE I REMAIN, DOOMED TOGREET ANOTHER SUNRISE, ALONE
EVEN IN COMPANY, THE OLD MAN ONTHE TOWN BENCH WHOSE ONLY TRUE
FRIENDS ARE THE DUCKS HE FEEDS,THOUGH SOON, THEY, TOO, WILL BE
DEAD.
>> STEPHEN: WELL YEAH, BUT YOUWILL BE ALIVE, HANS.
ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH, YOURBLEAK WORLD VIEW IS GOING TO
KEEP YOU GOING FOR A LONG TIME.

>> STEPHEN: YEAH.
HANS:  THAT'S WONDERFUL!

YIPPEE!
AAGGHH, MEIN HEART...
>> STEPHEN: HANS, ARE YOUOKAY?

>> HANS:  YOU REALLY THINK ILOOK AWFUL?
DON'T SAY THAT JUST TO MAKE MEFEEL BETTER.
>> STEPHEN: NO, SERIOUSLY, YOULOOK LIKE YOU'RE AT DEATH'S
DOOR.
>> HANS:  THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
I AM SAVED.
IT IS MY FATE TO ONCE MORE RIDETHIS COLD ROCK AROUND THE SUN,
ONLY TO WIND UP EXACTLY WHERE ISTARTED -- ALONE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S THE SPIRIT,BUDDY.
THE HONORABLE HANS BEINHOLZ,EVERYBODY!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
