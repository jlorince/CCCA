MOLESTINGS ARE ON THE RISE.
OH, WELL.
NATION, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT SUPERPACS
FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW.
THEY WERE CREATED AFTER THE
SUPREME COURT CITIZENS
UNITED RULING WHICH ALLOWED
UNLIMITED CORPORATE
INDIVIDUAL OR UNION
DONATIONS FOR POLITICAL
SPEECH.
I LIKE TO THINK OF THEM AS A
GIVE A PENNY, TAKE AN
ELECTION TRADE.
WELL, TUESDAY WAS THE
DEADLINE FOR ALL SUPERPACS
TO DISCLOSE HOW MUCH MONEY
THEY RAISED AND FROM WHOM.
AND TO ALL THE WORRYWARTS
OUT THERE, WHO SAID
SUPERPACS WERE GOING TO LEAD
TO A CABAL OF BILLIONAIRES
SECRETLY BUYING DEMOCRACY,
WRONG.
THEY ARE PUBLICLY BUYING
DEMOCRACY.
JIM.
>> RIGHT NOW TEN MILLION
DOLLARS IS FLOWING TO A PRO
GINGRICH SUPERPAC BANKROLLED
BY LAS VEGAS BILLIONAIRES
SHELDON AND MIRIAM ADELSON.
>> ROMNEY SUPERPAC RESTORE A
FUTURE TOOK HIM MORE THAN
$10 MILLION, BIG CHECKS
WRITTEN BY HIS FORMER
COLLEAGUES AT BAIN CAPITAL.
>> JON HUNTSMAN GOT SOME
HELP WITHIN THE FAMILY.
HIS FATHER JON HUNTSMAN
SENIOR GAVE HIS SUPERPAC
NEARLY $2 MILLION.
>> HUNTSMAN'S FATHER, BY THE
WAY, HAS BEEN NAMED OFFICIAL
HOST OF THIS YEAR'S MOST
AWKWARD THANKSGIVING DINNER.
IN FACT, HALF OF THE
CANDIDATE'S SUPERPAC MONEY,
$67 MILLION CAME FROM JUST
22 INDIVIDUALS.
NOW I AM SURE THAT THE GOOD
GOVERNMENT GOO GOOS OUT
THERE IS AING THIS IS JUST
HANDING ALL THE POWER TO THE
1%.
WHEN IN FACT, 22 PEOPLE OUT
OF A POPULATION OF 300
MILLION PEOPLE IS IN FACT,
GIVE ME ONE SECOND, SORRY
SORRY-- THAT'S 7/1
1,000,000, OF 1% SO OCCUPY
WALL STREET, ARE YOU GOING
WANT TO CHANGE THOSE SIGNS.
FOLKS, THIS IS WHAT THE
SUPREME COURT INTENDED WITH
THEIR CITIZENS UNITED
RULING.
22 BILLIONAIRES DECIDING WHO
OUR NEXT LEADER WOULD BE.
NOW I'M SURE IT'S THE WAY
THAT THE 22 BILLIONAIRES WHO
CHOSE OUR FOUNDING FATHER
WAS WANT IT.
SO JOIN ME IN HONORING THESE
22 PATRIOTS WHO HAVE GIVEN
SO MUCH AND EXPECT SO MUCH
IN RETURN.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE
YOU THE PEOPLE SELECTING OUR
NEXT PRESIDENT.
>> OH BEAUTIFUL,
FORESPACIOUS SKIES, FOR
AMBER WAVES OF GRAY.
FOR PURPLE MOUNTAIN MAJESTY,
ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAIN.
