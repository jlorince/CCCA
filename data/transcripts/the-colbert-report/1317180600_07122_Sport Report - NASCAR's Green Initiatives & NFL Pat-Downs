(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SNUNG THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!
NATION, IT'S TWO OUT, BOTTOM OF
THE NINTH, BASES LOADED AND I'M
HOLDING A SPEAR GUN.
THIS IS THE SCORE REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
♪ WHOO!
♪
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I LOVE NASCAR.
IT ANSWERS THE AGE-OLD QUESTION
"WHAT IF MY BOX OF TIDE COULD GO
200 MILES AN HOUR?"
(LAUGHTER)
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK
TIMES," NASCAR'S BEGUN EMPLOYING
AN AMBITIOUS SET OF GREEN
INITIATIVES THAT INCLUDES
COLLECTING USED FUEL, PLANTING
TREES TO OFFSET CARBON EMISSIONS
AND DEPLOYING SHEEP TO KEEP THE
INFIELD GRASS SHORT.
(LAUGHTER)
SHEEP?
THIS IS AMERICA!
WHEN WE NEED TO KEEP GRASS SHORT
WE HIRE MEXICANS.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, SUCH SILKY COATS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THE AL GORIFICATION OF
AUTO RACING MUST STOP.
I DON'T WANT NASCAR RECYCLING OR
MAKING THEIR CARS MORE FUEL
EFFICIENT THAN THEIR CURRENT
FOUR TO FIVE MILES PER GALLON.
(LAUGHTER)
WASTEFUL BURNING OF FUEL IS
NASCAR'S BEST SELLING POINT.
IF ANYTHING, THE CARS GET IN THE
WAY.
I'D PAY GOOD MONEY JUST TO WATCH
CORPORATE SPONSORS FLAMING VASTS
OF GASOLINE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE WINNER IS WHICH EVER TEAM'S
BLACK PLUME BLOCKED OUT THE SUN
FIRST.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, FOOTBALL SEASON
IS UPON US AND UNFORTUNATELY THE
SCAREDY PANT WETTERS AT THE
N.F.L. ARE INSTITUTING A NEW
POLICY AT THE STADIUMS.
>> N.F.L. FANS NOW HAVE TO
ENDURE A LITTLE MORE SECURITY ON
THE WAY INTO STADIUMS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
GUARDS ARE NOW DOING FULL BODY
PATDOWNS.
>> Stephen: YES.
FULL BODY PATDOWNS.
WHICH MAY TAKE A WHILE BECAUSE
SOME FANS HAVE SOME VERY FULL
BODIES TO PAT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, THE MOVE COMES AFTER A FAN
PRODUCED A STUN GUN IN THE
STANDS AT A JETS/COWBOYS GAME
AND ZAPPED SOME FELLOW
SPECTATORS.
BIG DEAL!
EVERYBODY TAILGATES!
HE WAS JUST GRILLING INSIDE THE
STADIUM.
PLUS, IF THE N.F.L. DISARMS ALL
THE SPECTATORS, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO FOR ENTERTAINMENT
WHEN THERE'S A LULL IN THE
VIOLENCE ON THE FIELD?
NOW SECURITY PERSONNEL WILL BE
SEARCHING FANS FROM THE ANKLES
TO THE KNEES AS WELL AS THE
WAIST UP.
DAMN!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SHOULD NEVER CARRY A WEAPON
BETWEEN YOUR KNEES AND YOUR
WAIST!
YOU'D HAVE TO CRAFT SOME KIND OF
I DON'T KNOW, HIP-MOUNTED
GUN-CARRYING HARNESS!
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
FOLKS, SECURITY GUARDS WILL ALSO
BE LOOKING FOR BOOZE: I'M SORRY.
BUT I NEED BOOZE FOR ANY EVENT
THAT LASTS MORE THAN THREE
HOURS.
THAT'S AS TRUE FOR FOOTBALL AS
IT IS FOR JURY DUTY.
(LAUGHTER)
FEAR NOT, NATION, FEAR NOT.
TEAM COLBERT HAS YOU COVERED.
YOU CAN PASS THE SCREENING AND
GET YOUR DRINK ON THANKS TO MY
PATENTED NEW SHOESçó STEPHEN
COLBERT'S...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN COLBERT'S BIRK STALK.
GO AHEAD, PAT ME DOWN FROM THE
ANKLES UP.
ONCE I'M INSIDE IT'S PARTY TIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, AND AND OFF MY BEER.
