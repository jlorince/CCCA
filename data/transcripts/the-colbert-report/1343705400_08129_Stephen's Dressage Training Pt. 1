IT IS FROUFROU.
GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.
(APPLAUSE) WELL, FOLKS, THE PEOPLE, THE WORKING PEOPLE LOVE DRESSAGE.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, FOLKS, TO PROVE THAT DRESSAGE IS FOR JOE SICK PACK I GOT DOWN AND DIRTY IN
THE BLUE COLLAR WORLD OF VELVET TOP HATS.
JIM?
>> Stephen: TO PROVE THAT DRESSAGE IS THE NEW AMERICAN PASS TIME, I HEADED TO
HAWTHORNE HILL IN LONG VALLY,
NEW JERSEY, TO MEET WITH FORMER OLYMPIC-- OLYMPIAN AND COACH OF THE 2012 U.S.
EQUISTRIAN TEAM MICHAEL BARISONE.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
>> MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
>> IT'S A PLEASURE TO YOU HAVE HERE.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
BECAUSE-- AM I GETTING SHADOW ON MY FACE HERE?
IS THIS BETTER?
>> Stephen: WOW, DRESSAGE.
JUST LIKE I PICTURED IT.
HORSES AND EVERYTHING.
>> OKAY, I'LL LOSE IT.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
MICHAEL, ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> WHY ARE YOU THE GUY TO TEACH ME ABOUT DRESSAGE?
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN ACCURATELY ANSWER THAT.
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> THIS ISN'T THE GUY,
EVIDENTLY.
LET'S GO.
I WILL GIVE YOU ONE MORE SHOT AT THIS.
>> I'LL DO IT.
>> WHY ARE YOU THE GUY TO TEACH ME ABOUT DRESSAGE?
>> WELL, I'M A MAN RIDER AND I THINK I RELATE WELL TO OTHER MALE RIDERS AND I HAVE
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NAMED DRESSAGE THE OFFICIAL SPORT OF THE SUMMER.
>> CLAY.
>> Stephen: ONE QUESTION ABOUT DRESSAGE.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT-- BECAUSE I CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE HORSE?
>> AS A RIDER OR THE GENERAL PERFORMANCE OF WHAT I AM DOING.
>> Stephen: KIND OF THE WHOLE THING.
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
>> THE HORSE HAS THREE BASIC GAITS.
A WALK, AND A TROT AND A CANTOR.
AND WE DEVELOPED THE HIGHEST LEVEL THEIR ABILITY WITHIN THOSE GAITS.
EVENTUALLY AT THE OLYMPIC LEVEL YOU PUT IT TO MUSIC AND RIDE TO FREESTYLE WHICH
IS MUCH LIKE A FREE SKATE IN THE FIGURE SKATING.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET THE SKATES ON THE HORSE.
>> YOU DON'T.
>> Stephen: THE HORSE DOES IT.
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
>> I'M USING IT AS A COMPARISON TO ANOTHER SPORT.
>> Stephen: OH, I'M SORRY.
I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE DRESSAGE OR HORSE DANCING JUST AS AWESOME AS POSSIBLE.
HOW ABOUT A HORSE MORE PIT,
WHERE ALL THE HORSES ARE JUST KIND OF FLAL AROUND.
>> NO, NO.
IT NEEDS TO BE NICE AND FLUID AND STEADY AND EVEN AND EVERYTHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE METRED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU ARE HE GOOD.
IS THERE SINGING IN DRESSAGE?
>> FINAL ROUND AT THE OLYMPICS-- SSES.
>> Stephen: HOLD ON.
♪ ♪ AND THEN I COME OUT AND I SING THE SON THAT WE DANCE TO.
HOW ABOUT THAT.
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY-- .
>> Stephen: I'M THINKING LIKE SORT OF A DIRTY DANTZING.
LIKE I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE WHICH STAND IN THE CENTER OF THE RING AND THE
HORSE COMES AT ME AND I LIFT-- I LIFT THE-- WHAT ABOUT THAT.
>> I THINK WILL YOU HAVE A HARD TIME PICKING HER UP.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE OR BEGIN OF DRESSAGE.
DID JUST ONE DAY SOME YOUNG HORSE SAY TO HIS DAD, DAD, I DON'T WANT TO CHARGE INTO BATTLE.
I JUST WANT TO DANCE!
>> WELL, IT'S BASED IN MILITARY RIDING.
THE GARDEN VARIETY HORSE THAT I WOULD TRY TO MAKE AN OLYMPIC HORSE OUT OF WILL
NOT BE GOOD AT RUNNING INTO A BATTLE OF BLAZING GUNS.
WILL PROBABLY RUN AWAY FROM IT.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE NOT BIG ENOUGH.
>> THEY ARE JUST HIGH STRUNG AND NOT REAL BRAVE.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOW MEASURE HORSE IN.
>> IN HANDS.
>> Stephen: HOW BIG THAT IS THAT.
>> A HAND IS FOUR.
>> Jon: IS THAT-- I THINK THE ORIGIN OF SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR HAND
BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF YOUR HAND.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BIG HANDS.
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BIG HANDS.
>> Stephen: LARGE HORSE.
ALSO YOU BLOOEP-- HUGE
[BLEEP].
>> IN ORDER TO DO DRESSAGE,
IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT I GO NEAR A HORSE BECAUSE I HAVE A LIFELONG DEEP SEEDED FEAR OF ALL ANIMALS.
>> IT COULD GET IN THE WAY OF YOU BEING SUCCESSFUL.
>> Stephen: HOW SHOULD I AVOID GETTING MY SKULL KICKED OFF MY BODY.
>> NORMALLY DON'T GO RIGHT BY THE HORSE.
THAT USUALLY DOESN'T TURN OUT WELL.
>> Stephen: DOES THE HORSE WIN THE MEDAL OR THE PERSON WIN THE MEDAL.
>> THE RIDER.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THE HORSE SEEMS TO BE DOING A LOT OF HORSE DANCING.
>> THE MAJORITY, I WOULD SAY,
OF THE PERFORMANCE IS BASED UPON WHAT THE HORSE IS DOING.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> THE MEDALS AWARD TO THE RIDER BUT IT IS REALLY FOR THE COMBINATION.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
I SEE YOU HAVE SOME AWARDS BACK HERE.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO WEAR THAT TIARA.
>> THE TIARAS WERE WON BY MYSELF.
>> Stephen: THAT'S YOUR TIARA.
>> I WON IT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE SAY DRESSAGE IS AN ELITIST SPORT.
I MEAN YOU GUYS WEAR TIARAS.
>> IF YOU COMPLETED YOUR LESSON YOU CAN WEAR THE TIARA.
>> Stephen: MICHAEL, LET'S GET OUR DRESSAGE ON.
>> GAME ON.
>> Stephen: JOIN ME TOMORROW AS I GO FOR THE TIARA AND GAIN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF
THE TOOLS OF THE TRADE.
PUT SOME MUSS KNEEL IT, I CAN TAKE IT.
>> I CAN'T.
