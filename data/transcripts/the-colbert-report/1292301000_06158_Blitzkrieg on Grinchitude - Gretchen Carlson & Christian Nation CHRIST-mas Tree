EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, WE MUST NEVER FORGET
THAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT THE
BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOR.
THAT'S WHY IN MY HOUSE THE GIFTS
UNDER THE TREE AREN'T JUST
WRAPPED, THEY'RE SWADDLED.
THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON
GRINCHITUDE.
>> HO, HO, HO.
OOOOHFUL.
♪ HALLELUJAH ♪♪
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: FIRST BACKGROUND
IN THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS,
FLORIDA, WHERE THE TEAM AT WESH
CHANNEL 2, ORLANDO'S NEWS
LEADER, SOUNDED THE ALARM.
>> THIS HEATHROW ELEMENTARY MOM
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE
IDENTIFIED SAYS THE SCHOOL IS
TAKING HOLIDAY RESTRICTIONS TOO
FAR.
SHE JUST GOT THE GUIDELINES.
EVEN TRADITIONAL CHRISTMAS
COLORS ARE OUT.
>> YOU CAN'T USE RED AND GREEN.
>> Stephen: FORTUNATELY THIS
STORY WAS PICKED UP BY FOX AND
FRIENDS' RESIDENT MALL ELF.
>> THIS IS SO CRAZY I CAN'T EVEN
READ THE STORY.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LET RED AND
GREEN IN THE CLASSROOM.
HOW DO YOU EQUATE RED AND GREEN
WITH JESUS?
I DON'T GET IT.
TAKE AWAY THE NATIVITY SCENE.
NOW TAKE AWAY RED AND GREEN.
THAT'S CRAZY.
>> Stephen: IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S TOTALLY INSANE.
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE MAKING THIS
STUFF UP, WHICH THEY ARE,
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL
SCHOOL TRICK, THE BANNING OF RED
AND GREEN IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.
WELL, HOW WAS GRETCHEN SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?
SHE HAD SOME TRUSTWORTHY SOURCE.
>> RIDICULOUS.
DON'T USE THIS OR DON'T TALK
ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: AN ANONYMOUS,
SLURRING WOMAN HANGING AROUND A
SCHOOL AT NIGHT.
AND WHO CARES, WHO CARES IF THIS
STORY...
( APPLAUSE )
WHO CARES IF THIS STORY ISN'T
TRUE.
THIS IS WAR.
SO FOX AND FRIENDS, LET ME FEED
YOU SOME AMMUNITION THAT I TRUST
YOU WON'T FACT CHECK.
JIM.
ROLL MY ANONYMOUS SOARSES.
>> I WORK AT APPLEBEE'S.
BECAUSE OF THE LAST SUPPER,
THEY'RE BANNING TABLES OF 12 OR
MORE.
THERE GO ALL MY TIPS.
>> MY TOWN IS REMOVING ALL
LETTER Ts FROM SIGNS FOR
LOOKING TOO MUCH LIKE CROSSES,
NOW PEOPLE ARE HAVING ACCIDENTS
AT STOP SIGNS.
I THINK I HEARD THAT'S TRUE.
>> ANYONE WITH A WHITE BEARD AND
ROSIE CHEEKS WILL BE SHOT ON
SIGHT.
[WHISTLING]
[WHISTLING ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAH]
>> Stephen: IT'S A TRUE STORY.
SO GRETCHEN, START REPORTING
THESE STORIES IMMEDIATELY.
IF YOU DON'T, PEOPLE MIGHT
FORGET THE REASON FOR THE
SEASON, YOUR BASELESS
INDIGNATION.
BUT FOLKS, IT'S NOT ALL BAD NEWS
OUT THERE.
LAST YEAR I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE
CHRIST-MAS TREE, A CHRISTMAS
TREE WITH A WOODEN CROSS NAILED
IT TO, BECAUSE THE BEST PARTS OF
CHRISTMAS ARE THE REMINDERS OF
CHRIST'S SUFFERING.
THAT'S WHY EVERY YEAR I LOOK
FORWARD TO RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED
JUDAS.
WELL, THEY'VE OUTDONE THEMSELVES
THIS YEAR WITH THE NEW CHRISTMAS
NATION CHRIST-MAS TREE.
IT'S RED, WHITE AND BLUE.
THE CROSS IS LIST FROM WITHIN
AND IT PROVES THAT AMERICANS
LOVE JESUS, AND YES, WE ARE A
CHRISTIAN NATION.
IT'S LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON AND
JESUS TEAMED UP AND DECLARED
INNOCENCE FROM TASTE.
( LAUGHTER )
BEST OF ALL... BEST OF ALL, THIS
TREE CAN BE USED YEAR ROUND,
CHRISTMAS, FLAG DAY, FOURTH OF
JULY.
HELL, THIS THING WOULD BE PRETTY
GOOD IN A GAY PRIDE PARADE.
MY REAL WORRY IS HOW IS IT GOING
TO BE MADE BETTER NEXT YEAR.
THERE'S NO REASON THOSE TWO
CROSSES CAN'T BE GUNS TOGETHER.
MAYBE ADD SOME NACHO CHEESE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, PUT SOME CITIES
ON THAT THING.
YEAH.
