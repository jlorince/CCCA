( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HEY, STEVEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
THIRD TIME HERE.
THREE TIME'S A CHARM. THANKS FORLOOSENING YOUR TIE.
LOOKING CASUAL.
>> I WORE A TIE, I THOUGHT IMIGHT TRY AND MATCH
>> Stephen: SIR, YOU ARE THEAUTHOR OF EIGHT BEST-SELLING
BOOKS INCLUDING "EVERYTHING BADIS GOOD FOR YOU" AND "WHERE GOOD
IDEAS COME FROM."
YOUR LATEST IS "HOW WE GOT TONOW."
SIX INNOVATIONS THAT MADE THEMODERN WORLD.
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Stephen: IS AMERICA ONE OFTHOSE INNOVATIONS.
IT'S THE GREATEST INNOVATIONMANKIND EVER GOT
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMERICANSIN THE BOOK, SO IF THAT'S ENOUGH
TO SATISFY YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE THE SIXINNOVATIONS.
BOOM LET'S DO IT, LET'S BUZZFEEDTHEM
>> ONE OF THEM IS A GLASS OFCLEAN DRINKING WATER IN A LARGE
METROPOLITAN CITY.
THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARYBREAKTHROUGH.
>> Stephen:  WHICH IS THEINNOVATION, THE GLASS OR THE
WATER?
THE WATER.
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN DRINK AGLASS OF WATER FROM A TAP AND
NOT WORRY ABOUT DYING OF TYPHOIDTHREE DAYS LATER.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN, BUT, OFCOURSE, YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK
MOUNTAIN DEW.
SO WATER.
>> YEAH, ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.
>> Stephen: THERE WE GO.
>> THE ABILITY TO RECORD THESOUND AND TRANSMIT THE SOUND --
>> Stephen:  WE'RE DOING THAT,TOO.
>> THE SIMPLE MATERIAL GLASS,WHICH WAS ARGUABLY THE SINGLE
MOST IMPORTANT MATERIAL OF THELAST 1,000 YEARS.
>> Stephen: THE GLASS LENSES ONTHESE CAMERAS, WHAT ELSE?
>> AND THEN THERE IS CLOCKS ANDTIME.
WITHOUT ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OFTIME AND COLD-- TECHNOLOGIES OF
REFRIGERATION AND AIRCONDITIONING.
>> Stephen: SO, CLOCKS, WE'REON A CERTAIN TIME RIGHT NOW.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: AND REFRIGERATION.
I'M SUPER COOL.
SO ALL OF THE-- WHAT DO YOU MEANREFRIGERATION?
REFRIGERATORS ACTUALLY HAVE ALOT OF THOSE THINGS, TOO.
THEY REFRIGERATE, LIGHT INSIDE,GLASS SHELVES, WATER OUT OF
DOOR. THE REFRIGERATOR IS THEENCAPSULATION OF ALL THAT IS
GOOD ABOUT INVENTIONS.>> YOU BROUGHT IT ALL TOGETHER.
>> Stephen:  WAIT, SO HOW DIDWE GET TO NOW?
HOW DID WE GET REFRIGERATION?
THAT'S ACTUALLY-->> SO REFRIGERATION, THAT STORY
BEGINS WITH A CRAZY GUY NAMEDFREDERICK TUDOR WHO IN THE EARLY
1800s HAD THIS IDEA THAT HECOULD TAKE LARGE BLOCKS OF ICE
FROM FROZEN NEW ENGLAND LAKESAND SHIP THEM ALL THE WAY TO
RIO, AND BOMBAY AND THECARIBBEAN, SELL WHAT WAS
EFFECTIVELY FREE IN NEW ENGLAND,SEE IT TO
PEOPLE IN HOT PLACES IN THEWORLD.
IF YOU WERE GROWING UP IN THECARIBBEAN IN 1800 YOU WOULD HAVE
NEVER EXPERIENCED ICE IN ANYFORM.
HE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO DO THIS.
>> Stephen: THEN HOW DID THEYMAKE THOSE DELICIOUS DAIQUIRIS.
>> EXACTLY.
THEY HAD NO IDEA.
>> Stephen: REALLY? BEFORE THATTHEIR DAQUIRIS WERE HOT?
>> STEAMING HOT DAIQUIRI.
IT WAS DELIGHTFUL.
( LAUGHTER )YOU KNOW, THE POOL SCENE WAS
REALLY DISAPPOINTING.
IT WAS LIKE, THIS IS SO HOT.>> Stephen: NO ONE'S GOING TO
SANDALS>> BUT HERE'S THE THING.
HE ACTUALLY MANAGES TO GET THESEBLOCKS OF ICE THERE WHICH IS
AMAZING HE GOT IT THERE WITHOUTIT MELTING.
BUT WHEN IT ARRIVED, PEOPLE ARELIKE, "WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
WITH THAT?
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE 500 YEARSAND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUE NEEDING
ICE," SO NO ONE WANTED TO BUYIT.
HE HAD TO CONVINCE LOCALS THATICE CREAM WAS A NICE THING AND
HAVING DAIQUIRI BY THE POOL WASA NICE THING AND EVENTUALLY MADE
HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARSSHIPPING ICE BLOCKS AROUND THE
WORLD.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S NOT AIRCONDITIONING.
I DON'T MEAN TO BLOW THE DOORSOFF YOUR BOOK.
SO-->> I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, SO I
DON'T -->> Stephen:  OKAY, PERFECT.
NOW, HERE'S THE THING, I LOVEBOOKS LIKE THIS.
I LOVE TV SHOWS LIKE THIS.
I LOVE WATCHING THIS STUFF.
I DON'T WANT TO USE ANY OF THISINFORMATION IN POLICY MAKING.
THIS IS A VERY POPULAR SHOW ONPBS.
THIS IS A VERY POPULAR BOOK.
HOW COME POLITICIANS DON'T WANTTO USE THE SCIENCE?
WHY DO THEY RUN AWAY FROM ITWHEN THEY GET TO OFFICE?
>> I THINK BECAUSE SOMETIMESSCIENCE ASKS THAT WE ALTER OUR
BEHAVIOR IN SOME WAY.
ONE OF THE WAYS AC, ONCE IT WASINTRODUCED, ALL THESE PEOPLE
MIGRATED -- IT TRIGGERED THELARGEST MIGRATION OF HUMAN
BEINGS IN THE HISTORY OF THEUNITED STATES WHERE THEY MOVED
TO THE SUNBELT AND MOVED TOFLORIDA AND THESE DESERT STATES
WHERE MAYBE THAT MANY PEOPLESHOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE LIVING.
AND IT TRIGGERED CLIMATEPROBLEMS, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE CLIMATE SCIENCE, IT DOESREQUIRE SOMETIMES THAT PEOPLE
ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIORAND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO HEAR
THAT.
>> Stephen: SO AIR CONDITIONINGITSELF MOVED PEOPLE TO PARTS OF
THE WORLD THAT WERE NORMALLY TOOHOT TO LIVE IN AND THEN THEY
NEEDED MORE AIR CONDITIONING TOCOOL IT DOWN.
>> THAT IS PARTIALLY THE CYCLE
>> Stephen:  WHY DON'T WE BUILDA BIGGER AIR CONDITIONER
FOR THE ENTIRE EARTH?
>> YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: HOW DID AIRCONDITIONING LEAD TO REAGAN?
>> THAT'S THE THING, ALL THESEPEOPLE-- IT'S TRUE.
I KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSEHE'S A HERO OF YOURS.
RIGHT AFTER AIR CONDITIONING ISINTRODUCED, THERE'S A MASS
MIGRATION TO THE SOUTH, AND THATENDS UP TRIGGERING A HUGE SWING
IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AIR,60-VOTE SWING FROM THE NORTH TO
THE SOUTH AND REAGAN WINS IN1980 BUILT AROUND THIS SUNBELT
COALITION THAT SIMPLY DIDN'TEXIST 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO.
WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING, IT'SENTIRELY POSSIBLE RONALD REAGAN
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELECTEDPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen:  SO THE GREATESTGIFT GOD EVER GAVE MANKIND WAS
FREON.
THAT AND FIVE OTHER GREATINVENTIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEVEN JOHNSON, "HOW WE GOT TONOW."
THE FINALE IS NEXT WEDNESDAY ONPBS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
