(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
LOOKING AT THE LATEST RESULTS,IT HAS BEEN A GOOD NIGHT SO FAR
FOR REPUBLICANS.
SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN STILLAWAKE TO CELEBRATE IT.
AND IT IS OFFICIAL, THE G.O.P.
HAS TAKEN THE SENATE ANDEVERYTHING IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.
CONSERVATIVES HAVE BIG PLANS FORTHIS COUNTRY.
JUST ASK THE LIBERALS.
>> IF REPUBLICANS WIN, THE WILDMEN WILL BE COMING OUT FOR
BLOOD.
THEY'LL TRY TO KILLObamaCare.
FORGET IMMIGRATION REFORM,THEY'LL WANT HIGHER BORDER
FENCES.
>> YOU WILL HAVE A HUGE PUSH TOOPEN PUBLIC LANDS FOR DRILLING.
>> YOU CAN COUNT ON PRESIDENTOBAMA BEING IMPEACHED.
>> Stephen: OH, YOU CAN COUNTON OBAMA BEING IMPEACHED BECAUSE
CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME CAN HARDLYWAIT TO SWEAR IN
PRESIDENT BIDEN.
OH, GOD.
OH, NO.
THE POINT IS, THIS IS THE MOSTSIGNIFICANT ELECTION OF MY OR
ANYONE'S LIFETIME. HERE TO AGREEWITH ME, FROM THE DISH,
BLOGGER AND UNRECONSTRUCTEDOBAMA SUPPORTER ANDREW SULLIVAN,
ANDREW SULLIVAN, EVERYBODY.WHOO!
ANDREW!
(APPLAUSE)GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GREAT.
>> Stephen: IT MUST BE A ROUGHNIGHT FOR YOU.
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK ORSOMETHING STRONGER LIKE A
REVOLVER?
HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THISCRUSHING DEFEAT FOR THE
DEMOCRATS?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S AMIDTERM ELECTION IN THE SECOND
TERM OF A PRESIDENT AND -->> Stephen: ALWAYS THE MOST
IMPORTANT.
>> WELL WITH, NORMALLY YOU WOULDEXPECT THEM TO GAIN ABOUT SEVEN
SEATS AND LOOKS LIKE THEY'LLGAIN ROUGHLY AROUND THAT.
SO IT'S NOT OUT OF THE ORDINARYFOR MIDTERM IN THE SECOND TERM
OF A PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: WHATEVER LETS YOUCRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)DO YOU STILL SUPPORT OBAMA?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: BUT THE DEMOCRATSDIDN'T SUPPORT OBAMA, THEY
DIDN'T -- THEY RAN AWAY FROM THEPRESIDENT, AND LOOK HOW IT
HELPED THEM.
>> YES.
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT, NEVER
UNDERSTOOD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'SACTUALLY GOT A TERRIFIC ECONOMIC
RECORD COMPARED TO ANY OTHERDEVELOPED NATION ON THE PLANET.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
NOT A REAL CONSERVATIVE BECAUSEWE DON'T COMPARE OURSELVES TO
OTHER NATIONS.
THERE'S THE UNITED STATES ANDTHERE'S JUST OTHER PLACES.
>> HERE'S WHAT I DON'TUNDERSTAND ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT ENACTUNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH
IS THEIR GOAL FOR 40 YEARS ANDTHEY RUN AWAY FROM THAT
ACHIEVEMENT AND REFUSE TO TALKABOUT IT.
THEY'RE WEAK-KNEED, LILY-LIVEREDCOWARDS WHEN IT COMES TO
REALLY FIGHTING THE FIGHT. I AMSTILL KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICALLY
AND TEMPERAMENTALLY REPUBLICANBUT I AM SUPPORTING THIS
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BECAUSE ITHINK HE HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANSNOW FOR POLITICS IN WASHINGTON?
BECAUSE NOW OBAMA CAN'T GETANYTHING DONE, AS OPPOSED TO THE
CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN HEDOESN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.
>> IN SOME WAYS, I THINK THEMOST SIGNIFICANT THING TONIGHT
IS NOT THE SENATE BUT THE HOUSE,THE GAINS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
MADE IN THE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE THEY?
I HAVEN'T PAID ANY ATTENTION.
>> I DON'T KNOW THE EXACTNUMBERS NOW.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW ANDI DON'T KNOW. SO WE'RE THE
UNINFORMORED, INFLUENCING EACHOTHER IN REALTIME.
>> THEY GAINED AROUND 10SEATS AND CHUCK TODD, WHO
HAS BEEN THE ORACLE IN THIS,ARGUED THAT THEIR GRIP IS SO
TIGHT IN THE HOUSE THEY MAY NOTBE ABLE TO BE GOTTEN RID OF IN
THE HOUSE UNTIL 2022, WHICHMEANS ANY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT
FROM NOW ON WILL HAVE TO DEALWITH AN EXTREMELY
CONSERVATIVE HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES.
>> Stephen: THE REAL PROBLEM IHEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT
THESE THINGS IS THE DEMOCRATSDON'T COME OUT AND VOTE IN
MIDTERMS.
LOW TURNOUT FAVORS THEREPUBLICANS.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET MOREAMERICANS TO VOTE?
SHOULD WE HAVE THE "I VOTED"STICKERS DEEP FRIED?
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE PRETTYTASTELESS
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
>> NEXT ELECTION IS THE FIRSTELECTION AS AN IMMIGRANT I'LL BE
ABLE TO ACTUALLY VOTE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE YOURCITIZENSHIP NOW?
>> NOT YET.
IT WILL COME THROUGH IN THE NEXTYEAR AND I'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE.
>> Stephen: ANDREW, THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR JOINING ME!
ANDREW SULLIVAN!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
