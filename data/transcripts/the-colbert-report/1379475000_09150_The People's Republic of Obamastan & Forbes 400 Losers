UNITED STATES.
ALSO I WANT TO THANK ANY OF OURVIEWERS FROM ITALY WATCHING

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )CIAO!
FOLKS, I WISH I WERE AS HAPPY ASYOU ARE, BUT I'M AFRAID WE'RE
LIVING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLICOF OBAMASTAN.
FOLKS, IT IS NOT SAFE TO BE RICHIN THIS COUNTRY ANYMORE.
FRANK LEIBER I WOULD GIVE ALL MYFORTINES TO THE NEEDY BUT I
DON'T WANT TO TURN SOME POORPERSON INTO A TARGET.
( LAUGHTER )NO, NO, NO, I'M AFRAID ALL THAT
MONEY IS MY CROSS TO BEAR.
IT'S A CROSS MADE OF SOLID GOLD.
VERY NICE, ACTUALLY.
WELL, DURING A SPEECH YESTERDAY,PRESIDENT OBAMA HIT THE RICH
WITH ANOTHER DRONE STRIKE INTHAT HE WAS BORING.
JIM.
>> THE TRENDS THAT HAVE TAKENHOLDS OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES
OF A WINNER-TAKE-ALL ECONOMY.
THOSE TRENDS HAVE BEEN MADEWORSE BY THE RECESSION.
THE TOP 1% OF AMERICANS TOOKHOME 20% OF THE NATION'S INCOME
LAST YEAR.
MOST OF THE GAINS HAVE GONE TOTHE TOP .01%.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S CLARWARFARE, FOLKS.
THE TOP .01%.
HE'S PITTING THE UNATTAINABLYRICH TO THE UNIMAGINABLE RICH.
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THATBILLIONAIRES ARE FORCED TO GO TO
SEPARATE SCHOOLED SCOOLZ, FLY ONTHEIR OWN PLANES, AND OFTEN END
UP BEHIND BARS.
BUT NOW, SOME BILLIONAIRES AREBEING LEFT BEHIND.
>> EVEN IF YOU HAVE $1 BILLION,THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT ON
THE FORBE 400 LIST.
"FORBES" IS OUT THIS MORNINGWITH ITS 32nd ANNUAL LIFT OF
THE 400 WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.
THIS YEAR THE RICH ARE GETTINGRICHER.
>> FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED TOHAVE $1.3 BILLION.
THERE WERE 61 BILLION ARIZONATHAT WEREN'T EVEN RICH ENOUGH TO
MAKE THE "FORBES" 400 THIS YEAR.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW WHOTO FEEL WORSE FOR.
THOSE POOR BILLIONAIRES OR"FORBES" MAGAZINE WHO JUST LOST
SUBSCRIBES OF SCRIBERS PURPOSEFOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
IT'S A SAD DAY TO BE ABILLIONAIRE.
YOU TOIL YOUR WHOLE LIFE TOBUILD A MEANINGFUL LEGACY FOR
YOUR FAMILY, ONLY TO FIND OUTTHAT BILLION DOLLARS YOU EARNED
WAS WORTHLESS.
EXCEPT FOR THE MONEY PART.
