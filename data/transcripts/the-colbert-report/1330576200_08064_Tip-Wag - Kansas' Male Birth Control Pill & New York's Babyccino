(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU, SIR.
NATION, ANYBODY WHO WATCH THIS
IS SHOW KNOWS I NEVER RUSH TO
JUDGMENT.
I WAKE UP EARLY, SHOWER AND
SHAVE, EAT A FULL BREAKFAST,
THEN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A HORSE
MOLESTERRER.
(LAUGHTER)
YES, I SAID "MOLESTERRER."
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RECENT
TUSSLE WITH CATHOLIC BISHOPS HAS
MADE BIRTH CONTROL A CONTROVERSY
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS!
IT IS SUCH A FUN THROWBACK!
I HOPE THE NEXT THING WE'RE
ARGUING OVER IS THE GYRATIONS OF
ELVIS' PELVIS!
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUR DAUGHTERS
AWAY FROM THAT NEGRO MUSIC!
WELL, THERE'S BEEN A NEW MONEY
SHOT ACROSS THE BOW IN THE
BATTLE OVER CONTRACEPTION.
50 YEARS AFTER THE ADVENT OF THE
BIRTH CONTROL PILL FOR WOMEN, A
REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGIST IN KANSAS
SAYS HE MAY HAVE COME UP WITH A
COMPOUND THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY
BE THE FIRST BIRTH CONTROL PILL
FOR MEN.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS
DANGEROUS.
(LAUGHTER)
IF BIRTH CONTROL BECOMES WIDELY
AVAILABLE TO MEN THEY MIGHT WANT
TO HAVE A LOT OF SEX.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF
MY FINGER TO THE SPERMICIDAL
MANIACS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF
KANSAS WHO DEVELOPED THIS PILL.
ANY OF US WHO HAVE ATTENDED MASS
AT THE CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE
SANTORUM KNOW...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
KNOW THAT CONTRACEPTION IS AN
AFFRONT TO ALL THAT'S HOLY.
AND BIRTH CONTROL HAS SOME
UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECTS.
>> WHEN YOU WERE CAMPAIGNING IN
IOWA YOU TOLD AN EVANGELICAL
BLOG IF ELECTED YOU WOULD TALK
ABOUT WHAT "NO PRESIDENT HAS
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.
-- THE DANGERS OF
CONTRACEPTION."
WHY?
>> WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IS
THE INCREASING NUMBER OF
CHILDREN BEING BORN OUT OF
WEDLOCK IN AMERICA.
>> Stephen: YES.
CONTRACEPTION LEADS TO MORE
BABIES BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK.
(LAUGHTER)
THE EXACT SAME WAY FIRE
EXTINGUISHERS CAUSE FIRES.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO... THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO GIVE MEN
ACCESS TO THIS BIRTH CONTROL
PILL, WE NEED TO DO IT
RESPONSIBLY.
EVERY SPERM THAT HAS POTENTIAL
TO BE A HUMAN BEING WAITING TO
BE BORN.
SO BEFORE WE GIVE MEN THE POWER
TO JUST WIPE THEM OUT, WE MUST
BE SURE THAT THEY SEE THE FACE
OF THAT SPERM.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS WHY I'M CALLING FOR A
LAW REQUIRING ALL MEN WHO WANT
THIS PILL SO FIRST SUBMIT TO A
TRANSURETHRAL ULTRASOUND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TOTALLY NONINVASIVE PROCEDURE
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
ULTRASOUND WAND JAMMED UP THE
WING-WANG.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU JUST GET IT UP THERE AND
LOOK AROUND UP PERISCOPE!
PING!
YOU WILL... YOU MEN WILL THINK
TWICE ABOUT TAKING THAT PILL
ASSUMING YOU SURVIVE.
NOW FOLKS...
(LAUGHTER).
EVERYONE KNOWS...
(APPLAUSE).
NEXT NEXT UP, FOLKS, EVERYONE
KNOWS ADVERTISERS LOVE THE YOUTH
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT'S WHY MY SHOW
IS GEARED TOWARD INFANTS.
OH, WHICH REMINDS ME, BREAKING
NEWS, PEEKABOO!
(APPLAUSE)
THAT ALWAYS GETS ME.
I MEAN, WHERE DID I GO?
ONE OF LIFE'S GREAT MYSTERIES.
NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW, I GUESS.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED BY A
BRAND NEW BABY TREND.
FOR MORE WE GO TO AMERICA'S MOST
TRUSTED NEWS SOURCE, TWO WOMEN
SWILLING CHARDONNAY AT 10:00
A.M.
>> SO IN BROOKLYN AND APPARENTLY
THIS TREND STARTED IN AUSTRALIA
THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED BABY
CHINNO.
THEY ARE CAPPUCCINOS FOR BABIES.
ONE OF THE BARISTAS IN BROOKLYN
IS SERVING A HANDFUL OF THEM
EVERYDAY.
>> YES, BABY CCINOS AND THEIR
EVEN YOUNGER BEVERAGE FETAL
LATTES.
SO A TIP OF MY HAT FOR HOOKING
BABIES ON THE FOAM DRAGON.
ANYONE WITH A BABY KNOWS IT'S
ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THEM UP
IN THE MORNING.
SOME SLEEP UNTIL NEARLY 4:00
A.M.
ACCORDING TO ONE PARENT WHO
BRINGS HER KIDS IN FOR
BABYCCINOS, THEY JUST LOVE THE
TASTE OF COFFEE, I DRINK COFFEE
EVERYDAY OF THE YEAR SO THEY
LIKE IT, TOO.
YES, PARENTS, EVERYTHING YOU DO
EVERYDAY YOUR KIDS SHOULD DO THE
SAME.
FOR INSTANCE, A LOT OF PARENTS
CAN'T HAVE A COFFEE WITHOUT A
CIGARETTE SO IT'S TIME WE
STARTED SELLING KIDS VIRJUNIOR
SLIMS.
YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, ACTUAL
