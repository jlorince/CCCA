125,000 PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS,
BALANCED TWO CITY BUDGETS,
DIDN'T RAISE TAXES OR CUT POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS.
WHAT IS IT THAT HOUSTON'S GOT GOING ON THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DOESN'T?
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS BUT IT'S LIKE
WE'RE REENACTING GOTHAM CITY IN THE REST OF AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER) ARE YOU THE BATMAN?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I INVITE EVERYBODY TO COME TO HOUSTON AND CHECK IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
WE'RE A VERY LIVABLE CITY.

MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU COMBINE THE HEAT OF TEXAS AND THE HUMIDITY OF NEW ORLEANS.

WE'RE A BIG MANUFACTURING CENTER
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT AN ODD COSMOPOLITAN QUALITY.
I WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT THERE.
YOU ARE ALSO THE FIRST OPENLY GAY MAYOR OF A MAJOR CITY IN AMERICA.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M GOING TO PRETEND YOU ARE APPLAUDING FOR AMERICA AND NOT GAY.
(LAUGHTER) HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE THAT TEXAS-- TEXAS-- SIX SHOOTERS,
CONSERVATIVES, GEORGE BUSH, RICK PERRY, HOW IS HOUSTON ELECTING A GAY MAYOR?
NO OFFENSE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO OFFENSE TO ALL OF YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT IT WAS
AN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA SENSATION WHEN I WAS ELECTED BUT HOUSTON ELECTED ME SIX TIMES BEFORE THEY
ELECTED ME MAYOR.
>> Stephen: MAYBE IT WAS A FLUKE!
(LAUGHTER)
>> SIX TIMES.
AND THEY KNEW EVERY TIME.
I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO.
AND HOUSTON IS VERY TOLERANT OF A LOT OF THINGS.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO, NOT WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU'RE FROM.
>> Stephen: THEY KNEW?
YOU DIDN'T HIDE THIS?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: SO YOUR STAFF SAID JUST GET IT OUT THERE.
>> I WAS A LESBIAN ACTIVIST BEFORE I BECAME MAYOR.
I WAS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR AND THEY ELECT MED SIX TIMES ALREADY.

>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT SNGT
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT?
>> NO, BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN 250 OTHER MAYORS IN AMERICA THAT
FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO AND NOW OUR PRESIDENT THINKS THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE EQUAL MARRIAGE
RIGHTS AS WELL.
SO I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: AS MAYOR OF A TEXAS CITY DO YOU WALK AROUND THE STREETS IN A TEN-GALLON HAT WITH
YOUR THUMBS IN YOUR POCKETS WITH SIX SHOOTERS?
(LAUGHTER) SPITTING TOBACCO?
>> YOU HAD ME UNTIL THE TOBACCO.
>> Stephen: ONCE A YEAR DURING RODEO TIME I GET MY HAT AND BOOTS AND RIDE A HORSE DOWN THE
MIDDLE OF MAIN STREET.
>> Stephen: HONEST TO GOD?
>> HONEST TO GOD.
WE ALL DO.
>> Stephen: ALL OF YOU DO?
>> IT'S ONE OF THE SKILLS A HOUSTON MAYOR MUST HAVE.
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE RODEO PARADE.
