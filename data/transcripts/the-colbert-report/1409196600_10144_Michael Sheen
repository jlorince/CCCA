ARE THE PEOPLE THIS IS BASEDON SO THESE WERE REAL PEOPLE,
RIGHT WHAT WERE THEY TRYINGTO DO.
>> THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE.
VIRGINIA JOHNSON HAD NO MEDICALBACKGROUND. SHE TURNED OUT
TO BECOME DR. MASTER'S SECRETARY AND FOUND OUT THAT
HE WAS DOING SORT OF SECRETSEX STUDY BECAUSE IT WAS
VERY CONTROVERSIAL THIS WASIN THE 50s.
>> Stephen: BACK THEN IT WASJUST FiRM HANDSHAKE, GOOD
NIGHT, MADAME AND NINEMONTHS LATER THERE WAS A BABY.
>> A SHAKE OF THE LEG, ANDYOU'RE ON TO THE NEXT ONE
BUT YEAH, SO THEY WERE DOINGTHIS-- THIS SEX STUDY BUT
THEY HAD TO SORT OF DO ITBEHIND CLOSED DOORS.
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY WOULDBE OUTDOORS AND THAT WOULD
BE WRONG.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS ALSO ALITTLE SEXY.
>> YES.
AND SO SHE HELPED HIM WITHTHAT AND EVENTUALLY SHE
BECAME AN EQUAL PARTNER.
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WAS VERYCONTROVERSIAL AT THE TIME.
>> Stephen: BUT KINSEY HADALREADY DONE SOME STUFF.
>> HE HAD.
BUT MAINLY RELIED ON ANECDOTALEVIDENCE
>> Stephen: LIKE I HEARDTHIS GUY ONCE DID THIS THING.
>> YEAH.
WELL THIS IS INTERESTINGBECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY
SO MUCH HAS CHANGED NOW.
WE'VE COME SUCH A LONG WAY.
WHEN I WAS IN DRAMA SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD.
YES.
>> WE USED TO BE AFFILIATED WITHA MEDICAL SCHOOL DOWN THE
ROAD AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULDASK US TO COME AND IMPROVISE AS
PEOPLE WITH SOME SORT OF SEXUALDYSFUNCTION IN THEIR
RELATIONSHIP FOR THE DOCTORS TOLEARN FROM.
SO WE WOULD GET ALL THESEREAL CASES AND THEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO PRETEND WE WERE THENAND THEY WOULD HAVE TO WORK
OUT THE PROBLEM.
AND ONE TIME THE PROBLEM WASTHAT THE COUPLE, THEY
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEYWEREN'T GETTING PREGNANT
AND IT TURNED OUT THE COUPLEWERE
HAVING SEX IN EACH OTHER'SARMPITS.
>> Stephen: WAS IT GOOD?
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW HEHAS SEX IN HER ARMPIT.
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTANDHOW SHE HAS SEX IN HIS ARMPIT.
>> HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TOLEARN, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: THAT MIGHT BEWHAT SCISSORING IS
>> AS AN ACTOR DOING THIS,WHAT KIND OF RESEARCH DID
YOU DO. DID YOU HAVE TO DO ARIDE-ALONG?
DID YOU HAVE TO DO ANY SEXRESEARCH. DO YOU ENJOY THE SEX?
>> I DID THE SEX ONCE AND IHAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER LILY.
AS A RESULT.
>> ARE YOU CLAPPING FOR MYDAUGHTER OR THE SEX I HAD.
SO I DID IT THE ONCE IT WASLIKE GOING TO SCHOOL, ON THE
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL I WENT.
MY MOTHER SAID HOW WAS IT ISAID IT WAS LOVELY BUT I'M
NOT GOING AGAIN, BUT THATWAS SORT OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE
WITH THE SEX.
>> Stephen: BUT DID YOULEARN ANYTHING, BECAUSE
HERE'S MY PROBLEM.
HERE'S WHERE THE GUNS COMEOUT.
I THINK SEX IS FINE, I'M AFAN, OKAY.
BUT DO WE HAVE TO LEARNABOUT IT?
DOESN'T THAT TAKE SOME OFTHE MYSTERY OUT OF IT?
YOU KNOW, NOT KNOWING.
I KNOW I'M A GUY, I KNOWWHAT I'VE GOT.
AND THE GIRLS HAVE GOTTHE-- AND NEED WE KNOW MORE
THAN THAT?
I MEAN WHY DISSECT THERAINBOW.
>> THIS IS JUST THE ATTITUDETHAT WILLIAM MASTERS HAD TO
DEAL WITH IN THE '50s.
>> Stephen: AND BECAUSE HEDEALT WITH THAT, NOW WE KNOW
EVERYTHING AND NOTHING ISREALLY EXCITING ANY MORE.
BACK THEN THE SEARS CATALOGWAS A TURN-ON.
NOW THERE'S NOTHING ON THEINTERNET THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ME YAWN.
HAVEN'T WE GONE TOO FAR.
THAT WAS A FORM OF SEX,YAWNING.
THE SPECIAL PORNOGRAPHIC WEBSITES FOR PEOPLE THAT GET
TURNED ON BY YAWNING.
>> DO YOU HAVE -->> WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR.
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY SEX, WE ARENOW INUNDATED WITH IMAGES OF
SEX AND SEXUALITY ALL THETIME.
IT HAS BECOME BRANDED,IT'S BECOME COMMERCIALIZED.
IN SOME WAYS WE ARE JUST ASPRONE TO FEELING SHAME ABOUT
SEX AS IN ITS '50s WHEN THEYKNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.
DID THESE GUYS GET INTROUBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO
HIM?
>> THEY GOT IN A FAIR AMOUNTOF TROUBLE, YES.
>> THEY WENT THROUGH VERYCONTROVERSIAL THINGS LIKE AT
ONE POINT THEY SAID THEYCOULD CURE SOMEONE FROM
BEING GAY.
