SUMMERTIME FEVER, BUT WE GOT DO
THIS THING.
NATION, WASHINGTON IS A HOT AND
HUMID PLACE, AND I BELIEVE THE
BEST MEASURE OF OUR ELECTED
OFFICIALS IS HOW WELL THEY KEEP
WITHOUT FRIDGE RATION.
FOR INSTANCE, YOU KNOW WE'LL
HAVE JOHN BOEHNER AROUND FOR A
LONG TIME BECAUSE HE'S CLEARLY
BEEN HICKORY SMOKED.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THIS MORNING WE LOST ONE
OF OUR MOST BELOVED AND
WELL-PRESERVED SENATORS, WEST
VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT ROBERT C.
BYRD, WHO WAS CRUELLY CUT DOWN
IN THE PRIME OF HIS 92 YEARS
OLD.
SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY HE WAS
SPRYLY WHEELED ON TO THE SENATE
FLOOR TO BOLDLY VOTE YEA FOR THE
HEALTH CARE REFORM, OR AS HE SO
ELOQUENTLY... YES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOR AS HE HIMSELF SO ELOQUENTLY
PUT IT, "I'LL HAVE THE FISH."
[LAUGHTER]
IF SENATOR BIRD CAN BE SNATCHED
AWAY FROM US IN THE BLINK OF AN
EON, ISN'T IT A SOBERING
REMINDER OF OUR OWN MORTALITY?
I MEAN, I'M 46.
SENATOR BIRD WAS 92.
THE DIFFERENCE IS A MERE MY
ENTIRE LIFE.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, I COULD WALK OUTSIDE
RIGHT NOW, GET HIT BY A BUS THEN
GRADUALLY RECOVER THROUGH YEARS
OF PHYSICAL THERAPY, GET HIT BY
ANOTHER BUS, RECOVER FROM THAT,
THEN RETIRE TO THE SEASIDE
COTTAGE I BUILT WITH MY GREAT
GRANDSON, THEN AT THE AGE OF 92,
THAT COTTAGE GETS HIT BY A BUS
