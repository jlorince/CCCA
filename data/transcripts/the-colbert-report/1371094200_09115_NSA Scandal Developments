CARS CAN SUCK IT!
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FOLKS, OF COURSE OUT THERE
IN THE NON-FREE PAUL McCARTNEY
PRIVATE CONCERT WORLD THEY'RE
STILL SIFTING THROUGH THE
BLOCKBUSTER REVELATIONS ABOUT
THE N.S.A.'S CYBER SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM PRISM.
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHOSE
INTERNET PRIVACY HAS BEEN
VIOLATED ARE SHOCKED TO LEARN
THAT ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET
WAS EVER PRIVATE.
AND NOW THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF
THE STORM, LEAKER EDWARD SNOWDEN
HAS GOTTEN BAD NEWS.
>> BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON, THE
NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRACTOR
WHERE SNOWDEN WORKED FOR THREE
MONTHS AT ITS HAWAII OFFICE
CONFIRMING HE'S BEEN FIRED.
>> Stephen: OOH, FIRED!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT CAN'T BE EASY IN THIS JOB
MARKET.
PLUS, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
REFERENCES.
HE ONLY HAS ALL OF YOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW AMONG SNOWDEN'S LEAKS IS THE
PAPER THAT SAYS THE N.S.A.
COLLECTED 97 BILLION PIECES OF
INTELLIGENCE FROM COMPUTER
NETWORKS WORLDWIDE IN MARCH,
2013 ALONE.
BUT 97 BILLION?
THERE'S NO BUILDING BIG ENOUGH
TO HOLD ALL THAT DATA!
AT LEAST UNTIL THEY FINISH THIS
ONE.
>> THESE PICTURES ARE AMAZING,
THE COMPOUND IS FIVE TIMES
LARGER THAN THE U.S. CAPITOL.
ALL TO STORE BIG DATA.
>> THERE WILL BE YOTTABYTES OF
DATA.
PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH
GIGABYTES.
A YOTTABYTE IS A MILLION BILLION
GIGABYTES.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: NOW TO PUT THAT IN
PERSPECTIVE: JUST ONE YOTTABYTE
IS EQUIVALENT TO 200 TRILLION
D.V.D.s.
WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY
D.V.D.s I'M BEHIND ON "GAME OF
THRONES."
(LAUGHTER)
SO NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT THE RED
WEDDING.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I HAVE TO ADMIT, AT FIRST I
FOUND THIS PROGRAM TO BE A
SHOCKING BREACH OF THE PUBLIC
TRUST.
THE INTIMATE DETAILS I SHARE
FROM MY GMAIL ACCOUNT ARE NO
BUSINESS OF BIG GOVERNMENTS.
THEY ARE FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY:
SO I CAN GET TARGETED ADDS FOR
BONER PILLS.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THEN I LEARNED THAT PRISM
TARGETS ONLY FOREIGNERS!
YEAH.
EVIDENTLY THAT TORCH OF FREEDOM
IS ONLY FOR AMERICANS.
FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD SHE'S
HOLDING BOOM MICS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE
LIMITING THEIR SEARCHING IS
NON-AMERICANS, PRISM'S DATA
ANALYSTS WOULD KEY IN SEARCH
TERMS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO
PRODUCE AT LEAST 51% CONFIDENCE
IN A TARGET'S FOREIGNNESS.
IT WAS SIMPLE, THEY USED SEARCH
TERMS AMERICANS WEREN'T FAMILIAR
WITH SUCH AS "PORTION CONTROL"
"PAID MATERNITY LEAVE" AND
"GOOOAAAL."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THIS IDEA OF FOREIGN
SURVEILLANCE REALLY STRIKES A
CHORD WITH ME, PARTICULARLY
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A GUEST TONIGHT
WHO STRIKES CHORDS
PROFESSIONALLY AND I AM 51% SURE
HE IS FOREIGN.
FOR ONE THING, AN AMERICAN WOULD
NEVER SAY "ALL YOU NEED IS
LOVE."
WHAT ABOUT NACHO CHEESE?
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT TO KEEP AN
EYE ON THIS GUY I'VE GOT CAMERAS
AND MICROPHONES ALL OVER THIS
STUDIO.
DON'T TELL HIM!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SIR
PAUL McCARTNEY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
