(LAUGHTER)
NATION, FOLKS THERE ARE
THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE IN
THIS WORLD.
THOSE WHO CAN COUNT, AND
THOSE WHO CAN'T.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT WAG
OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, FOLKS, THE LATEST
EDITION OF THE SO-CALLED
AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY
HAS ADDED ONE OF MY FAVORITE
WORDS.
ANCHOR BABY WHICH THEY
ACCURATELY DEFINED AS A
CHILD BORN TO A NON-CITIZEN
MOTH ANOTHER A COUNTRY THAT
GRANTS AUTOMATIC CITIZENSHIP
TO CHILDREN BORN ON ITS SOIL,
ESPECIALLY SUCH A CHILD BORN
TO PARENTS SEEKING TO SECURE
EVENTUAL CITIZENSHIP.
MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN
WIKIPEDIA WHICH DEFINES THEM
AS A CHILD BORN TO A
NON-CITIZEN MOTH NEVER A
COUNTRY THAT RON PAUL'S-- 2012,
RON PAUL 2012, RON PAUL
2012.
BUT NOW, FOLKS, AFTER A
COMPLAINT BY THE IMMIGRATION
POLICY CENTER, A GROUP THAT
SUPPORTS THE FAR LEFT
RADICAL IDEA OF HAVING
IMMIGRANTS, THE DICTIONARY
HAS ADD THE WORD OFFENSIVE
AND REDEFINED ANCHOR BABY AS
A DISPARAGING TERM.
WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A
WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE LEXI-QOU
ARDS AT THE AMERICAN
HERITAGE DICTIONARY.
FOLKS THERE IS NOTHING
OFFENSIVE ABOUT THE TERM
ANCHOR BABY.
AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
OPPONENTS BOB DAIN TOLD FOX
NEWS, WHAT'S OFFENSIVE ABOUT
ANCHOR BABY ISN'T THE TERM,
BUT THE PRACTICE OF HAVING A
BABY ON OUR SOIL TO GAME THE
SYSTEM.
DAMN STRAIGHT.
IT'S NOT THE WORD ANCHOR
BABY THAT'S OFFENSIVE, IT'S
THE ACT.
SAME THING WITH CHINESE FIRE
DRILLS.
WHY ARE THOSE ORIENTALS
ALWAYS TRYING TO DELAY
TRAFFIC AT OUR INTERSECTIONS?
WELL NOW-- I'M WRITING THAT
DOWN-- WELL NOW THAT ANCHOR
BABY HAS BEEN DECLARED
OFFENSIVE I HOLD LITTLE HOPE
FOR MY SUBMISSION GRAPPLING
BABY.
KNOWN, THE ALL TOO COMMON O
CONCERNS OF A PREGNANT WOMAN
IN MEXICO AIMING HER BIRTH
CANAL AT AMERICA TO LAUNCH
HER BABY OVER THE BORDER SO
THAT SHE CAN CLIMB IN USING
THE UMBILICAL CORD.
AND FOLKS, FOLKS--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IF YOU DON'T
THINK THIS IS HAPPENING, IF
YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS
HAPPENING YOU ARE LIVING IN
A DREAM WORLD.
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING ON
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY TO DEPLOY THOUSANDS
OF VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS TO THE
BORDER TO SPIKE THESE LITTLE
CRIMINALS BACK TO MEXICO.
POINT, AMERICA.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, WE ARE JUST
22 DAYS AWAY FROM THE IOWA
CAUCUS.
AND NEWT GINGRICH HAS A
DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD.
BAFFLING THE WASHINGTON
PREDICTO, BUT FOLKS I'M NOT
SURPRISED.
HE HAS GOT A GOOD HEAD ON
HIS SHOULDERS, AND A LOT OF
IT.
PLUS, HE'S NOT AFRAID TO
THINK OF NEW WAYS TO MAKE US
ALL AFRAID.
SO I'M GIVING A BIG TIP OF
MY HAT TO NEWT GINGRICH FOR
REPEATEDLY ALERTING THE
NATION TO AN UNDERREPORTED
THREAT, THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
PULSE.
>> ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE IS
ESSENTIALLY A PECULIARLY
SIZED NUCLEAR DEVICE THAT
BECOMES A GIANT LIGHTNING
STRIKE.
IT KNOCKS OUT ALL THE
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES, THE
ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE ATTACK
WAS LITERALLY DESTROY THE
COUNTRY'S CAPACITY TO
FUNCTION.
>> YES, AN ELECTROMAGNETIC
PULSE WOULD DISABLE ALL
ELECTRONS DEVICES, ALL
COMPUTERS.
THE ENTIRE POWER GRID SHUT
DOWN LEAVING TO THE
UNTHINKABLE.
WE WOULD HAVE TO LISTEN TO
THOSE AMISH BASTARDS SAY, WE
TOLD YOU SO.
NOW NEWT IS NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO IS CONCERNED WITH
BECOMING EMP-MAGEDDON.
SO IS HER MAJESTY'S SECRET
SERVICE.
>> ONE SINGLE ELECTRIC
LIGHT --
>> EMP.
>> A NUCLEAR DEVICE IN THE
UPPER ATMOSPHERE, CREATES
POWER, A RADIATION SURGE
THAT DESTROY ITS EVERYTHING
WITH AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT.
>> Stephen: YES, BOND, JAMES
BOND.
AGREES WITH GINGRICH.
NEWT GINGRICH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND JUST LIKE
BOND, GINGRICH IS CALM UNDER
PRESSURE, A LITTLE COCKY AND
IS FREQUENTLY SEEN WITH
DIFFERENT LEADING LADIES.
PLUS HIS HALF MILLION DOLLAR
LINE OF CREDIT AT TIFFANIES
PROVES HE KNOWS DIAMONDS ARE
FOREVER.
AND AS DAVID BROOKS POINTED
OUT, NEWT HAS CALLED FOR A
PERMANENT LUNAR COLONY TO
EXPLOIT THE MOON'S RESOURCES.
HMMMM, SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
NEWT IS A MOON RAKER.
AND NEWT HAS ALSO POINTED
OUT THAT A MIRROR SYSTEM IN
SPACE COULD PROVIDE THE
LIGHT EQUIVALENT OF MANY
FULL MOONS SO THERE WOULD BE
NO NEED FOR NIGHTTIME
LIGHTING OF THE HIGHWAYS.
HMMMM, HMMMM, GIANT SOLAR
MIRRORS ALSO SEEM FAMILIAR.
>> SHINING LIKE DIAMONDS IN
THE SKY.
>> Stephen: LET THE PLOT DIE
ANOTHER DAY.
NO, WAIT, WAIT, JIMMY, IT
JUST OCCURRED TO ME, ALL
THOSE SCHEMES WERE FROM THE
VILLAINS.
THAT MEANS GINGRICH ISN'T
BOND, HE'S BLOFELD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TIP OF MY HAT, YOU KNOW HE'S
IN THE TOP 1%.
WHICH MEANS HE'S CREATING
JOBS FOR ALL THOSE
