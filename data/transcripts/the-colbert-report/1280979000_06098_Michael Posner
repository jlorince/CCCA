>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
THE BUREAU OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN
RIGHTS AND LABOR.
TALK ABOUT A RENAISSANCE
BUREAUCRAT.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL POSNER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. POSNER, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
NOW, YOU WORK AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, RIGHT?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
AND YOU, ARE AS I SAID, THE
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND
LABOR.
HOW WAS CHELSEA'S WEDDING?
>> WASN'T THERE.
>> Stephen: YOU WEREN'T THERE?
>> NO, I WAS WORKING.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE.
AREN'T YOU TECHNICALLY THE
ASSISTANT MOTHER OF THE BRIDE?
>> NOPE.
>> Stephen: NO.
ALL RIGHT.
DEMOCRACY, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN
RIGHTS AND LABOR, WHAT DO THEY
HAVE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER?
>> WELL, THEY'RE VERY MUCH
RELATED.
HUMAN RIGHTS IS A WAY IN WHICH
PEOPLE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC
EXPERIENCE.
PEOPLE NEED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY,
TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICAL
PROCESS.
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE
THEMSELVES.
THEY NEED TO...
>> Stephen: IN THE UNITED
STATES YOU MEAN?
>> IN THE UNITED STATES AND
EVERYWHERE.
>> Stephen: WELL, THERE ARE
HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEN THERE ARE
AMERICAN RIGHTS.
[LAUGHTER]
AT WHAT POINT DO THE HUMAN
RIGHTS OF PEOPLE IN THESE OTHER
COUNTRIES, YOU KNOW, GET IN THE
WAY OF MY ABILITY TO BUY TWO
DOZEN TUBE SOCKS FOR $1.29.
DOESN'T THERE NEED TO BE SOME
LIMIT ON THAT?
>> ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT
OUR COUNTRY IS THAT WE REALLY DO
BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE
TO ORGANIZE IN A LABOR CONTEXT.
WE BELIEVE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT
TO HAVE DIGNITY IN THE WAY THEY
WORK.
AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR WAY OF
DOING THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY IS
SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF OUR
LIFEBLOOD.
IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE AS A
PEOPLE.
AND IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE
EXPORTING AND SHARING WITH THE
REST OF THE WORLD.
PEOPLE LOOK TO US FOR
LEADERSHIP.
>> THEY SHOULD LOOK TO US FOR
LEADERSHIP, AND THEY SHOULD
THEREFORE DO WHAT WE SAY BECAUSE
WE'RE THE LEADERS.
NO, LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP,
LEADERS TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO.
>> NEW YORK WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
TO ORGANIZE WITHIN THEIR OWN
SOCIETIES.
WE'RE REALLY NOT ABOUT TELLING
OTHERS WHAT TO DO.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF THEY
ORGANIZE IN WAYS WE DON'T LIKE?
WHAT IF THEY ORGANIZE IN WAYS
THAT ARE RESISTANT TO THE
INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA?
>> THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED
STATES ARE REALLY TO HAVE
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES, STABLE
DEMOCRACIES THAT RESPECT HUMAN
RIGHTS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE IN A
WORKPLACE WHERE THEY FEEL
THEY'RE BEING TREATED DECENTLY
WILL BE GOOD WORKERS.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE STABLE
WORKERS.
THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE GOOD
PRODUCTS.
AND THOSE ARE THE PRODUCTS THAT
AMERICANS WANT TO BUY.
>> THAT'S LABOR.
WE'VE COVERED LABOR.
LET'S GO HUMAN RIGHTS.
DOESN'T EVERYBODY HAVE PRETTY
MUCH HUMAN RIGHTS RIGHT NOW?
EVEN OUR BIGGEST COMMIE ENEMIES,
CHINA, WE PLAY BUSINESS FTSE
WITH THEM AND THEY'RE WEARING
WOOL LEXES SO ALL IS GOOD,
RIGHT?
>> WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS
WE'RE PRINCIPLED IN THE WAY WE
APPROACH A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA.
WE DO CARE ABOUT A ECONOMIC AND
SECURITY RELATIONSHIP, BUT HUMAN
RIGHTS HAS TO BE THE CENTER OF
WHAT WE DO.
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT
PEOPLE CAN'T PRACTICE THEIR
RELIGION.
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PRISONERS
BEING HELD BECAUSE OF THEIR
VIEWS.
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT
THAT IT IS A SOCIETY THAT BANS
INTERNET FREEDOM.
WE'VE GOT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT OUR
PRINCIPLES.
>> NOW, WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT MORE
PEOPLE IN PRISON THAN CHINA
DOES.
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: NO, IT'S TRUE
BECAUSE I JUST SAID IT.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S CALLED LEADERSHIP, WHAT I
JUST DID RIGHT THERE.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT... DOES THE
UNITED STATES HAVE ANY HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSES?
AND BEFORE YOU ANSWER, KEEP IN
MIND THE UNITED STATES IS NOT
DOING ANYTHING WRONG.
GO.
>> THE WRITES IS A LEADER ON
THESE ISSUES, BUT WE'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO FORM A MORE PERFECT
UNION.
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO BE
BETTER THAN WE ARE, BUT WE ARE A
LEADER AND WE ARE AN EXEMPLAR
FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSES, LIKE WHAT ARE THE
WORST ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW, AND BEFORE YOU
ANSWER, KEEP IT LIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S A TOUGH WORLD
OUT THERE.
>> Stephen: IT'S A BIG ONE,
TOO.
>> IT'S A BIG ONE.
>> BUT IT IS ALSO A WORLD WHERE
IN AFRICA THERE ARE DOZENS OF
WARS GOING ON.
PEOPLE ARE VERY VULNERABLE.
WE HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS IN
MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES ABOUT
PEOPLE MOTT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK
FREELY, TO PICK THEIR OWN
GOVERNMENTS.
WE'VE GOT TO BE ATTENTIVE TO
THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY DO
MATTER TO OUR ABILITY TO BE A
STABLE WORLD.
>> Stephen: WELL, YOU SAY
THERE ARE STILL WOMEN WITHOUT
RIGHTS, AND THERE ARE STILL
PEOPLE NOT ALLOWED TO PRACTICE
THEIR RELIGION.
IS THAT TRUE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> YOU THINK WE SHOULD FIX BOTH
OF THOSE?
>> IN MY JUDGMENT, RELIGIONS ALL
ARE... PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ABLE
TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION
FREELY AND RELIGIONS ALL OUGHT
TO BE RESPECTING OF THE RIGHTS
OF WOMEN.
I DON'T THINK THOSE THINGS ARE
CONTRADICTORY.
>> WHAT IS IN YOUR RELIGION,
PART OF YOUR RELIGION IS NOT
GIVING WOMEN RIGHTS?
>> WELL, I THINK PEOPLE INTERRAT
RELIGIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS, AND
I THINK PART OF OUR CHALLENGE IS
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE
CONSISTENT WITH OUR BELIEFS THAT
WOMEN NEED TO BE EMPOWERED AND
NEED TO BE TREATED EQUALLY, AND
AT THE SAME TIME, WE OUGHT TO BE
TREATING...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: SO WE'VE DONE
LABOR.
WE'VE DONE HUMAN RIGHTS.
LET'S TALK DEMOCRACY.
WE'VE GOT DEMOCRACY.
WHY DOES ANYBODY ELSE NEED IT?
IF THEY REALLY WANT OUR
DEMOCRACY, SHOULDN'T THEY INVITE
US TO INVADE THEM AND GIVE IT TO
THEM?
[LAUGHTER]
WORKED IN THE PAST.
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS A ROLE FOR
THE 82ND AIRBORNE TO PRODUCE
STABILITY IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT
IN THE LONG TERM, PEOPLE HAVE TO
HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT WORK.
THEY HAVE TO HAVE COURTS THAT
WORK.
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO
CHOOSE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A FREE PRESS.
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A STAKE IN
THEIR OWN SOCIETY.
THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT.
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE
WORLD WANT.
WHEN COUNTRIES ARE GOOD ALLY,
THAT'S BETTER FOR US.
>> Stephen: LAST QUESTION,
DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND
LABOR, YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE?
>> I LOVE THEM ALL.
>> Stephen: YOU LOVE THEM ALL?
ARE THEY LIKE YOUR CHILDREN?
>> I WORKED FOR MANY YEARS
OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT FOR A
HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, SO
THAT'S THE STARTING FOR ME.
>> Stephen: I'D GO WITH
DEMOCRACY BECAUSE HUMAN RIGHTS
ARE DEPRESSING, AND LABOR,
LOVELY PEOPLE, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN
THEIR HANDS?
