>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
NATION, IF YOU'VE WATCHED THISSHOW BEFORE-- AND I CERTAINLY
HOPE YOU HAVE-- DID YOU KNOWTHAT I ALWAYS SAY THAT ANY OLD
DOG CAN HUMP YOUR LEG, BUT ANALPHA DOG MAKES YOUR OTHER LEG
WATCH.
THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THEWEEK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THIS WEEK'S ALPHA DOG IS
CHIP WILSON C.E.O. OF THEUPSCALE YOGA CLOTHING STORE
LULULEMON.
NOW, WHILE OTHERS ARE BLIND TOWOMEN'S ISSUES, THIS SEEING EYE
ALPHA DOG IS WOMEN'S BESTFRIEND.
BACK IN 2009, HE OFFERED AUNIQUE TAKE ON WOMEN'S HISTORY
WRITING: "IN THE EARLY 1970sTHE PILL CAME INTO BEING.
WOMEN'S LIVES CHANGEDIMMEDIATELY.
FEMALES NO LONGER HAD TO MAKERELATIONSHIPS WORK.
MEN'S LIVES DIDN'T CHANGE,HOWEVER, AND THEY CONTINUED TO
SEARCH FOR A STAY AT HOME WIFELIKE THEIR MOTHERS.
MEN DID NOT KNOW HOW TO RELATETO THE NEW FEMALE, THUS CAME THE
ERA OF DIVORCES."
(AUDIENCE REACTS)YOU HEAR THAT, LADIES?
DIVORCE IS YOUR FAULT BECAUSEYOU GOT THE PILL ALLOWING YOU TO
HAVE ALL KINDS OF CARE-FREE SEX.
EVERY HUSBAND'S NIGHTMARE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T CALL
THIS ALPHA DOG SEXIST.
HE'S WAY MORE THAN THAT.
FOR INSTANCE, HE'S ALSO RACIST.
HE SAID THAT HE CHOSE A BRANDNAME WITH A LOT OF "Ls" IN IT
AS A MARKETING TOOL BECAUSE THESOUND DIDN'T EXIST IN JAPANESE
PHONETICS, TELLING ONEJOURNALIST "IT'S FUNNY TO WATCH
THEM TRY AND SAY IT."
(AUDIENCE REACTS)THAT IS HI-RARIOUS!
(LAUGHTER)ROH-ROH.
EARLIER THIS ALPHA DOG GOT ASWAT ON THE NOSE.
>> YOGA PANTS ARE BEING RECALLEDFOR BEING TOO SEE THROUGH.
THE RECALL INVOLVES PANTINGUSING THE SIGNATURE FABRIC THAT
IS COMBINATION OF NIGH LOB ANDLYCRA.
THIS IS 17% OF ALL LULULEMONBOTTOMS.
>> CUSTOMERS HAVE NOTICED THEIRWORKOUTS ARE LOOKING MORE LIKE A
PIPE SHOW SAYING LULULEMON'SPANTS ARE SEE THROUGH, LEAVING
LITTLE TO THE IMAGINATION.
>> NOW THE COMPANY IS GETTINGCOMPLAINTS ABOUT TWO OTHER
STYLES OF PANTS.
CUSTOMERS SAY THEY'RE SCRATCHY,PILLING, AND ONCE AGAIN SEE
THROUGH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
LULULEMON RECALLED ITSTRANSPARENT YOGA PANTS FOR WOMEN
WHICH CAUSED A HUGE DROP INSTOCK PRICE FOLLOWED BY A HUGE
DROP IN MEN GOING TO YOGA CLASS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT EVEN AFTER TURNING SUN SAL
YOU STATIONS INTO FULL MOONS--(LAUGHTER)
-- THIS ALPHA DOG REFUSED TOMUZZLE HIMSELF.
HE REVEALED WHY HIS PANTS WERENOT ONLY SEE THROUGH BUT
SUFFERED THE PILLING.
>> FRANKLY, SOME WOMEN'S BODIESJUST DON'T WORK FOR IT.
AND THAT COULD BE -->> Stephen: .
>> THEY DON'T WORK FOR THISPANT?
>> NO, THEY DON'T WORK FORCERTAIN -- SOME WOMEN'S BODIES.
JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT THERUBBING THROUGH THE THIGHS, HOW
MUCH PRESSURE THERE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
LULULEMON C.E.O. THINKS HISPRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE AND IT'S
YOUR FAULT BECAUSE AS PATANJALISAYS IN THE YOGA SUTRA
"CULTIVATE FRIENDLINESS TO THEHAPPY, COMPASSION FOR THE
UNHAPPY, DELIGHT IN THE VIRTUOUSAND INDIFFERENCE TOWARD THE
WICKED.
ALSO, NO FATTIES."
(LAUGHTER)NOW, NOT EVERY C.E.O. HAS THE
MARKETING SAVVY TO LIVE BY THEMANTRA "THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS
FAT."
(LAUGHTER)BUT CHIP HERE KNOWS THAT CALLING
OUT YOUR CLIENTELE'S CHUB-RUB ISJUST GOOD MARKETING.
IT MAKES THEM FEEL INSECUREABOUT THEIR BODIES, THAT'S
CAUSING THEM TO WORK OUT MOREWHICH MEANS THEY NEED MORE
ATHLETIC CLOTHES-- CHA-CHING.
(LAUGHTER)BY THE WAY, CHA-CHING IS ALSO
CHIP WILSON'S NICKNAME FORCHINESE PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)HI-RARIOUS!
AND AFTER HIS CRITICS BARKEDTHAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO ROLL
OVER AND APOLOGIZE HE RELEASEDTHIS HEART FELT STATEMENT.
>> I'M SAD.
I'M REALLY SAD.
I'M SAD FOR THE PEOPLE ATLULULEMON WHO I CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT.
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALLTHAT HAS OCCURRED AND THE IMPACT
IT HAS HAD ON YOU.
I'M SORRY TO HAVE PUT YOU ALLTHROUGH THIS.
>> Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT,LADIES?
CHIP WILSON IS SAD THAT YOURCHAFING HAM HOCKS MADE HIM PUT
HIS EMPLOYEES THROUGH THISDIFFICULT TIME.
THAT STILL WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THEHOUNDS IN THE MEDIA.
>> NO APPARENT APOLOGY TOCUSTOMERS, NO EXPLANATION AT
ALL.
>> CON FROM A MARKETINGSTANDPOINT CHIP WILSON'S APOLOGY
IS KIND OF A DISASTER.
SEEMS LIKE HE'S SAYING "I'MSORRY I GOT CAUGHT" BUT HE
DOESN'T SEEM SORRY HE SAID IT.
>> SOME ARE CALLING IT THE WORST"I'M SORRY" EVER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
IT WAS A PERFECTLY GOOD APOLOGY.
BUT SOME WOMEN'S BODIES JUSTDON'T WORK FOR IT.
IF CHIP'S "I'M SORRY" WASN'TGOOD ENOUGH, YOU PROBABLY
COULDN'T HEAR HIM PROPERLY OVERTHE LOUD RUBBING OF YOUR FAT
THIGHS.
(LAUGHTER)SO THANK YOU, CHIP WILSON, FOR
LIFTING YOUR THROWING PEE ONYOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEN BLAMING
THEM FOR BEING WET.
YOU, SIR, ARE MY ALPHA DOG OFTHE WEEK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
