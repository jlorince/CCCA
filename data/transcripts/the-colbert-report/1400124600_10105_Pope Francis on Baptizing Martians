WELCOME TO THE REPORT EVERYBODY
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
NATION, LONG-TIME VIEWERSOF THE SHOW WILL KNOW THAT I
DON'T LIKE TO HARP ON THESAME THINGS NIGHT AFTER
NIGHT BUT SOME THINGS AREJUST TOO IMPORTANT.
FOR INSTANCE, I HAVE SAID ITMANY TIMES, I AM NO FAN OF
POPE FRANCIS.
I SAID IT MANY TIMES I'M NOFAN OF POPE FRANCIS.
SEE, NOW I'VE SAID, I'VESAID IT MANY TIMES, MANY
TIMES.
(LAUGHTER)EVER SINCE HE TOOK OVER AT
HEAD OF THE CHURCH HE'S BEENA LITTLE TOO WELCOMING TO
ALL GOD'S CHILDREN.
JUST LAST YEAR HE SAIDEVEN ATHEISTS CAN GO TO HEAVEN.
GREAT IDEA, FRANK.
FIRST DOGS, NOW ATHEISTS.
WHAT IS NEXT, PRESBYTERIANS?IT'S MADNESS.
THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUTATHEISTS GETTING INTO HEAVEN
IS I'D BE ABLE TO WALK UP TOTHEM AND SAY I TOLD YOU SO.
THAT IS MY IDEA OF PARADISE.
WELL NOW POPE MOONBEAM OVERHERE HAS DRIVEN HIS WELCOME
WAGON WHERE NO POPE HAS GONEBEFORE BECAUSE AT MASS ON
MONDAY THE PONTIFF SAID IFFOR EXAMPLE TOMORROW AN
EXPEDITION OF MARTIANS CAMEAND SOME OF THEM CAME TO US
HERE, MARTIANS, RIGHT, GREEN,WITH THE LONG NOSE AND BIG EARS
JUST LIKE CHILDREN PAINT THEM.AND ONE SAYS BUT I WANT TO BE
BAPTIZED. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
WHEN THE LORD SHOWS US THEWAY WHO ARE WE TO SAY NO,
LORD, IT'S NOT PRUDENT, NO LET'SDO IT THIS WAY, WHO ARE WE TO
CLOSE DOORS.
YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT, FOLKS.
POPE FRANCIS WOULD BAPTIZE AMARTIAN.
OF COURSE FIRST HE'D HAVE TOCONVERT THEM FROM SCIENTOLOGY.
NOT THAT I FIND HIS PREMISEIMPLAUSIBLE.
IF AN EMISSARY CAME HEREFROM A CULTURE ADVANCED
ENOUGH TO TRAVERSE OUR SOLARSYSTEM, LAND ON OUR PLANET,
COMMUNICATE WITH HUMANS, THEVERY FIRST THING IT WOULD DO
WOULD BE TO SEEK OUT THE MANWITH THE FUNNIEST HAT AND ASK
HIM FOR A HEAD BATH.
BUT BAPTIZING ALIENS IS WAYOVER THE LINES.
GOD WAS VERY CLEAR ON THISPOINT IN ISAIAH 45:12. TURN TO
ME AND BE SAVED ALL THE ENDS OFTHE EARTH, END OF THE EARTH.
IF AN ALIEN WANTS TO BE INTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH, HE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED HEREBY CHRISTIANS ON A KANSAS
FARM LIKE CARDINAL SUPERMANWAS.
PLUS ONCE WE BAPTIZE THEALIENS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE THEY WANT TO TAKECOMMUNION. AND ASK YOURSELF
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE THE ONEPLACING A SMALL DELICATE
WAFER INTO THIS?
GAME OVER, MAN.
