(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WOW.
WOW.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN AT HOME.
THE A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE HERE IN THE STUDIO BECAUSE I WILL BE PLANNING ALL OF...
CLAIMING ALL OF THEM AS DEPENDENTS.
OF COURSE, TODAY IS TAX DAY,
FOLKS, WHERE WE ARE FORCED AS A NATION TO HAND OVER OUR HARD-EARNED CASH TO THE
WASHINGTON FAT CATS THANK GOD IT HAPPENS ONCE ONLY EVERY FOUR YEARS.
WHAT'S THAT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE THE OLYMPICS.
(LAUGHTER) WELL THEN WHY IS MICHAEL PHELPS MY ACCOUNTANT?
(LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, THIS YEAR WE ARE REMINDED WHY THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DESERVE A DIME OF MY MONEY.
WE ALL KNOW THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN BLOWING OUR BUSTED VEGAS ON WINE, HOT
TUBS AND APPARENTLY MAN PERMS.
NOW THE STAR OF THIS CIALIS COMMERCIAL WAITING TO ERUPT IS G.S.A. COMMISSIONER JEFF NEELY,
SUPPOSEDLY SCOUTING LOCATIONS FOR THE NOW-INFAMOUS $800,000 G.S.A. RETREAT.
I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THIS STORY MUCH SO FAR BECAUSE I NEW MY BUDDIES WERE ON IT LIKE WHITE
ON FOX.
(LAUGHTER)
>> LISTEN TO THIS ONE.
$146,000 FOR CATERING, $75,000 FOR TEAM BUILDING EXERCISES,
$6,300 FOR COMMEMORATIVE COINS AND $8,100 FOR BOOKS.
>> A $3 2,00 MIND READER AND $7 WORTH OF SUSHI.
>> WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE LATEST G.S.A. SPENDING OUTRAGE.
>> THE LATEST OUTRAGES FROM THE G.S.A..
OUTRAGE CONTINUES.
OUTRAGE.
OUTRAGE.
>> IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGE THERE HAD'S REALLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>>.
>> Stephen: DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME GRETA.
I HAVE A RAGING RAGE ON BECAUSE $8,100 FOR A CONFERENCE YEARBOOK?
I ASSUME JEFF NEELY WAS VOTED MOST LIKELY TO RESIGN.
WELL, YESTERDAY SOMEONE FINALLY HELD THE G.S.A. ACCOUNTABLE.
WATCH CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN AND DARYL AMERICAN DARYL ISSA PULL
THE STOPPER ON JEFF NEELY'S TUB OF LIES.
>> MR. NEELY, WHAT IS YOUR TITLE AT G.S.A.?
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, ON THE ADVICE OF COUNCIL I RESPECTFULLY DECLINE TO ANSWER BASED ON MY
FIFTH AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> MR. NEELY, DID YOU ATTEND THE 2010 WESTERN REGIONAL CONFERENCE IN LAS VEGAS.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, ON THE ADVICE OF MY COUNSEL I RESPECTFULLY DECLINE TO ANSWER BASED UPON MY
FIFTH AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WOULDN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
IF ISSA WANTS TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF HIM HE'LL HAVE TO PAY $3,200 FOR A MIND READER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS JEFF NEELY HIDING BECAUSE IN THIS
PICTURE IT'S NOT MUCH.
WHO IS HE PROTECTING?
WHO'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE?
>> IT HAPPENED UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WATCH.
>> THAT BLAME HAS TO GO RIGHT TO THE PRESIDENT.
HE'S THE GUY IN CHARGE.
HE'S THE C.E.O.
AND HIS DEPARTMENT HEADS ARE OUT THERE THROWING OUT MONEY AWAY.
YOU SHOULD PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT LIES.
>> Stephen: YES!
THE PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES WHILE HE'S IN OFFICE!
I WAITED 17 MINUTES AT THE POST OFFICE TODAY AND THERE WAS AN EMPTY WINDOW THERE THE WHOLE TIME.
WHERE WAS OBAMA?
(LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, THAT TUB GOES DEEPER.
NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO WINE GLASSES IN THAT PHOTO.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) WHO WAS THE OTHER ONE FOR?
AND COME TO THINK OF IT, WHO TOOK THE PHOTO?
SOMEONE ELSE HAD TO BE IN THAT BATHROOM AND WHEN YOU ELIMINATE EVERYONE I DON'T WANT IT TO BE,
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IT COULD BE, BARACK OBAMA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.
THIS HAPPENED ON HIS WATCH.
OH, SURELY THE SECRET SERVICE WOULDN'T HAVE LET THAT HAPPEN.
OH, I SUPPOSE IF THEY WEREN'T TOO BUSY BANGING HOOKERS IN THE NEXT ROOM!
AND, FOLKS, I ASK YOU, IF IT WASN'T OBAMA WHY IS HE SMILING IN THIS PHOTO?
AND YOU MAY ASK WAS THIS PHOTO SHOPPED?
