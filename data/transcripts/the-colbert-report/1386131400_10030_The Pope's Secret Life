>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU.
>> STEPHEN!  STEPHEN!  STEPHEN!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> YEAH, I I'M ANGRY TOO.
>> AS AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS
CATHOLIC, FOLKS, YOU KNOW I HAVE
TRIED TO CUT THE "NEW POPE" OVER
HERE SOME SLACK.
I WASN'T THRILLED WHEN HE WASHED
THE FEET OF MUSLIM CRIMINALS,
KISSED THE UNINSURED AND GOT ALL
MISTY ABOUT THE LOW-INCOME
MOOCHERS OUT THERE.
>> THEY PUT LESS IN THE
COLLECTION PLATE EACH WEEK BUT
THEY WANT THE SAME AMOUNT OF
HEAVEN?  HUH-UH.
READ YOUR FINE PRINT.  THE MEEK
SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH WHEN I
AM DONE WITH IT.
>> BUT, FOLKS, THIS WEEK THERE
WAS NEWS OUT OF THE HOLY SEE
THAT HAS ME HOLY SEETHING.
>> THE POPE MAY HAVE A SECRET
LIFE, RUMORS HE SNEAKS OUT OF
THE VATICAN AT NIGHT MIGHT BE
TRUE.  THE POPE DRESSES IN
REGULAR PRIEST CLOTHES AND GOES
INTO ROME AND MINISTERS TO THE
HOMELESS, THE POPE CONSIDERED
HIMSELF --
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> HE IS A VIGILANTE I HAVE CAR.
>> VICAR, COMING TO THE HELP OF
THOSE IN NEED .. HE IS A BAT
POPE!  HOLY, HOLY FATHER!
>> IT ALL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
NOW, HE IS JUST LIKE BRUCE
WAYNE.
HE IS A WEALTHY BACHELOR WHO
LIVES ALONE IN A GIANT MANSION,
AND BRUCE WAYNE HAS THE
BATMOBILE, WHILE FRANCIS HAS THE
POPEMOBILE.
NOT ONLY THAT, BATMAN TALKS TO
MORGAN FREEMAN, AND THE POPE
TALKS TO GOD, WHO IS ALSO MORGAN
FREEMAN.
>> AND -- AND --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: JUST LIKE THE BAT
SUIT, THE POPE SUIT HAS NIPPLES.
