( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, LAST NIGHT ALL EYES WERE
ON NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR THE VERY
FIRST SECOND REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE CANDIDATES WASTED IN
TIME ESTABLISHING THEIR
PRO-FAMILY CREDENTIALS.
>> I'M TIM PAWLENTY, I'M A
HUSBAND.
MY WIFE MARY AND I HAVE BEEN
MARRIED FOR 23 YEARS.
I'M THE FATHER OF TWO BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTERS.
>> KARA AND I HAVE R THE PARENTS
OF SEVEN CHILDREN.
>> I'VE HAD FIVE CHILDREN AND WE
ARE THE PROUD FOSTER PARENTS OF
23 GREAT CHILDREN.
>> I DELIVERED BABIES FOR A
LIVING.
DELIVERED 4,000 BABIES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I'M CONFIDENT
THESE CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO
CONNECT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
SINCE APPARENTLY THEY MADE MOST
OF THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
ANY WAY, THE CANDIDATES CEDE LOT
OF STUFF.
THE AUDIENCE WAS THERE.
IT WAS ELECTRIFYING.
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBTING WHAT
THE BOMBSHELL OF THE EVENING
WAS.
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT HERE FOR YOU, JOHN,
ON CNN TONIGHT.
I FILED TODAY MY PAPERWORK TO
SEEK THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES TODAY.
>> Stephen: WHAT THE WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
SOMEONE IN A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S LIKE GOING TO A WEDDING
AND THE COUPLE ANNOUNCES THEY'VE
APPLIED FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE!
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN THIS
COMING!
IT'S LIKE THE END OF AN.
MANY NIGHT SHYAMALAN MOVIE.
WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND!
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT ONE
OF THE CANDIDATES IS ACTUALLY
DEAD!
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHO'S IT GOING SNOB
>> PAWLENTY WAS THE LOSER.
>> HE REALLY LOOKED WEAK.
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE AN ALPHA MALE
GUY.
>> A BETA DOG, A BOILED NOODLE.
>> Stephen: A BOILED NOODLE?
NOT T-PAW!
HE WAS ALWAYS AT LEAST AL DENTE!
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, PAWLENTY'S CAMPAIGN WAS
SOARING LIKE A CHICKEN TOSSED
OFF A BARGE!
I MEAN, JUST TWO DAYS AGO ON FOX
NEWS SUNDAY PAWLENTY JACKED MITT
ROMNEY FLIGHT THE HEALTH CARE
PLAN!
JIM?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HE
DESIGNED OBAMACARE AFTER ROMNEY
CARE AND BASICALLY MADE IT
OBAMNEYCARE.
>> OH, NO!
OBAMNEYCARE IS PERFECT!
IT'S THE BRANGELINA OF POLITICAL
ATTACKS!
(LAUGHTER)
HE GOT MITT ROMNEY RIGHT IN THE
ACHILLES HEEL AND EVEN WORSE,
HEEL INJURIES ARE COVERED UNDER
OBAMNEYCARE!
SO THE MINNESOTA GOVERNOR WAS
TOTALLY PRIMED AND READY WHEN
JOHN KING LOBBED HIM A SOFTBALL
EVEN THE MINNESOTA WINS THE
COULD HIT.
>> YOU JUST HEARD THE GOVERNOR
REBUT YOUR CHARACTERIZATION
OBAMNEYCARE.
>> WELL, THE ISSUE THAT WAS
RAISED IN A QUESTION FROM A
REPORTER WAS WHAT ARE THE
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO AND
I JUST CITED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
OWN WORDS.
>> WAS OBAMNEYCARE ON FOX NEWS
SUNDAY, WHY IS IT NOT
OBAMNEYCARE STANDING WITH THE
GOVERNOR DELIGHT?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THE PERSON
WHO I QUOTED IN SAYING HE LOOKED
TO MASSACHUSETTS FOR DESIGNING
HIS PROGRAM.
>> Stephen: FORGET OBAMNEYCARE.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW MINNESOTA'S
HEALTH PLAN KEEPS TIM PAWLENTY
ALIVE WITHOUT A SPINE.
(LAUGHTER)
O BOOMNY CARE!
OBAMNEYCARE WAS PERFECT!
YOU HAD ROMNEY ON THE ROPES.
YOU'VE GOT TO FINISH HIM!
YOU'VE GOT TO SWEEP THE LEG.
CNN'S CORNELL BELCHER GETS IT.
>> IF SOMEONE OCCUPY IT IS STATE
THAT YOU AND I OCCUPY AND
THEY'RE AHEAD OF YOU I'M SORRY,
YOU'VE GOT TO CUT THAT PERSON
AND MAKE THEM BLEED.
NOW, DO YOU TAKE A HATCHET TO
THEM THE FIRST NIGHT IN THE
DEBATE?
NO, BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM
BLEED BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET AHEAD OF THAT PERSON
UNLESS YOU CUT THEM AND YOU MAKE
THEM BLEED.
>> Stephen: YEAH!
DOWN HIM!
DOWN HIM!
WHAT, WHAT?
OH!
MAKE HIM BLEED!
BY THE WAY, SOMEONE NEEDS TO
CHECK THIS MAN'S CRAWL SPACE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY DIDN'T YOU STICK IT INTO
ROMNEY AND TWIST THE HANDLE?
BY THE WAY, IF ROMNEY WON THE
DEBATES, I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF
HIS NOW.
AND ALL I CAN IMAGINE IS
PAWLENTY IS NOW RUNNING FOR
ROMNEY'S VICE PRESIDENT.
WHY ELSE WOULD HE LET MITT MOUNT
HIM LIKE A SILVERBACK GORILLA.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, THERE ARE A LOT OF
GOOD REASONS FOR PAWLENTY TO BE
VICE PRESIDENT.
ROMNEY HAS SAID HE LIKES THE
ECONOMIC IDEAS THAT PAWLENTY HAS
BEEN THROWING AROUND.
LIKE THIS ECONOMIC IDEA HE
ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK.
>> WE SHOULD CUT THE BUSINESS
TAX RATE BY MORE THAN HALF.
ON THE INDIVIDUAL RATES, I
PROPOSE JUST TWO RATES, 10% AND
25%.
>> Stephen: JUST TWO RATES.
IT'S EASY A CHILD COULD
UNDERSTAND IT, ESPECIAL THEY
E-TRADE BABY WHO I BELIEVE IS IN
THE TOP 2%.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE PAWECONOMICS, AVERAGE
AMERICANS WILL SAVE $700 A YEAR
WHILE AMERICANS WHO SAVE $10
MILLION A YEAR WILL SAVE $2.4
MILLION.
NOW, THAT WOULD WIDEN THE GAP
BETWEEN THE SUPERRICH AND THE
MIDDLE-CLASS BUT THAT GAP IS
ALREADY SO WIDE WE CAN'T HEAR
THEM COMPLAINING.
(LAUGHTER)
AND PAWLENTY HAS A SIMPLE WAY OF
PAYING FOR ALL HIS TAX CUTS.
>> WE CAN START BY WHAT I CALL
THE GOOGLE TEST.
IF YOU CAN FIND A SERVICE OR A
GOOD AVAILABLE ON GOOGLE OR THE
INTERNET, THEN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT PROBABLY DOESN'T NEED
TO BE PROVIDING THAT GOOD OR
SERVICE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: YES.
IF YOU CAN FIND IT ON GOOGLE,
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T DO IT.
THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULDN'T DO PORN.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GUYS... WHY PAY THE POST OFFICE
44 CENTS TO SEND YOUR GRANDMA A
LETTER WHEN YOU CAN PAY FEDEX 25
BUCKS.
IT SHOWS HER YOU CARE MORE AND
WHEN GRANDMA FEDEXS YOU A
BIRTHDAY CARD WITH $5 IN IT, IT
WILL ONLY TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS
TO HAVE ENOUGH TO SEND HER A
THANK YOU NOTE.
SO I SAY WE CAN GOOGLE TEST OUR
WAY TO ELIMINATING THE
GOVERNMENT ALL TOGETHER.
OKAY, FOR INSTANCE, WHO NEEDS
THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
TO MAINTAIN OUR INTERSTATE
HIGHWAYS WHEN I CAN JUST GOOGLE
R. PASQUALLY AND SONS PAVING.
IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THEIR WEB
SITE "NO PAVING JOB IS TOO BIG."
GOOD.
THEY CAN FILL THE POTHOLES ON
I-95.
AS LONG AS MR. DI PASQUALLY HAS
MORE SONS THAN MICHELE BACHMANN.
AND, FOLKS, IT'S EASY.
WE CAN ELIMINATE MEDICARE.
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF HEALTH
SERVICES ON THE INTERNET.
SENIORS, IF YOU'RE FEELING CHEST
PAIN, JUST FIRE UP YOUR MAC
BOOK, GO TO WEB M.D., SEARCH THE
MESSAGE BOARDS FOR THE RIGHT
PHARMACEUTICAL BY FRIENDING
CARDIAC PATIENTS ON FACEBOOK,
THEN CREATE A FAKE GMAIL ACCOUNT
TO BUY BLACK MARKET PLAVIX FROM
CANADA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE POINT IS REGARDLESS OF THE
FACT THAT TIM PAWLENTY CRATERED
IN LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, HIS
GROUND BREAKING GOOGLE SOLUTION
MEANS HE'S STILL AN ATTRACTIVE
CANDIDATE BECAUSE I CAN GOOGLE
TIM PAWLENTY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF I CAN GOOGLE TIM PAWLENTY
THAT MEANS HE'S ABSOLUTELY
UNNECESSARY IN GOVERNMENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHICH MAKES HIM THE PERFECT VICE
PRESIDENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
