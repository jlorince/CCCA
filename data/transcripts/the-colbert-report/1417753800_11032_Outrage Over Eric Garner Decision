NATION, FOLKS, I COME TO YOUTONIGHT FROM A CITY GRIPPED
BY FEAR.
BECAUSE FOR THE PAST 24HOURS NEW YORK HAS BEEN
ENGULFED IN A HELL STORM OFPEACEFUL PROTEST.
DEMONSTRATORS HAVE TAKEN TOTHE STREETS HALTING NEW YORK
TRAFFIC TO A LEVEL THAT CANONLY BE DESCRIBED AS NEW
YORK TRAFFIC.
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSEYESTERDAY A STATEN ISLAND
GRAND JURY CHOSE NOT TOINDICT AN NYPD OFFICER WHO
KILLED ERIC GARNER, ANUNARMED BLACK MAN.
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT IT ISSHOCKING THAT ANYONE IN
MANHATTAN HAS SHOWNAWARENESS OF STATEN ISLAND.
FOLKS, FOLKS, THESEPROTESTORS AREN'T JUST AFTER
THE NYPD.
THEY ALSO TARGETED ANOTHERINSTITUTION.
>> PROTESTS BROKE OUT,BLOCKS AWAY FROM ROCKEFELLER
CENTER LAST NIGHT WHERETHOUSANDS HAD GATHERED FOR
THE ANNUAL TREE LIGHTINGCHRISTMAS CEREMONY.
>> THEY'RE NOW CHANTING"SHUT IT DOWN, SHUT IT DOWN,
ERIC GARNER, MICHAEL BROWN"THEY TRIED TO SHUT DOWN THE
ROCKEFELLER CHRISTMAS TREELIGHTING.
>> THANK GOD IT WASN'T THEROCKEFELLER MENORAH
OR THIS PROTEST WOULD HAVE GONEON
FOR EIGHT MORE NIGHTS.
>> LOOK, FOLKS, I PEOPLE AREANGRY BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME
FOR ACTIVISTS TO TURNMIDTOWN SIDEWALKS INTO A
CONGESTED WAR ZONE.
THIS IS THE TIME FORTOURISTS TO DO THAT.
AND NATION-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I KNOW NEW YORK LOOKS TOME FOR LEADERSHIP SO I'M
CALLING FOR CALM.
NOW SURE, YOU COULD VIEW YETANOTHER NONINDICTMENT OF A
WHITE POLICE FOR THE DEATHOF AN UNARMED BLACK MAN AS
PART OF A LARGER TROUBLINGTREND.
OR YOU COULD BE FOX NEWS.
>> THE OFFICER IS WHITE.
THE VICTIM WAS BLACK.
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THISINCIDENT IS ALREADY, ALREADY
DRAWING COMPARISONS TO THESHOOTING DEATH OF MICHAEL
BROWN IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI.
>> THERE IS A TENDENCY THATTHREE EXAMPLES CREATE A TREND.
>> STATISTICS DON'T SAYTHERE IS A PATTERN.
>> THIS IS TO THE ABOUT RACEDISCRIMINATION AND I DON'T
THINK IT SHOULD BE LUMPEDTOGETHER WITH ANY OTHER
TRENDS THAT ARE GOING ON.
>> WELL SAID.
THIS IS NOT-- WE'REALL-- YES, I AGREE WITH YOU.
I AM ANGRY AT THE IDEA THISIS A TREND.
IT IS NOT A TREND IT IS JUSTA SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT
SHARE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS.
FOR THIS TO IT BE ANOFFICIAL TREND, TAYLOR
SWIFT WOULD HAVE TO KILLSOMEBODY AND TAY-TAY DON'T
PLAY THAT WAY.
OF COURSE LONG TIME VIEWERSOF THE LAST FEW MINUTES WILL
KNOW THAT I BROKE THE STORYABOUT RACIAL TENSION IN
AMERICA.
AT LEAST I ASSUME I DID.
LIKE YOU, I GET ALL MY NEWSFROM "THE COLBERT REPORT."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PLEASE!
DON'T LEAVE.
BUT WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONESWATCHING ME BECAUSE THIS
WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIEDHIS BEST TO ADDRESS IS THE
ISSUE.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE ISPROPOSING A SERIES OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT REFORMS INRESPONSE TO THE UNREST IN
FERGUSON, MISSOURI.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ASKINGFOR 263 MILLION DOLLARS OVER
THREE YEARS FOR ADDITIONALTRAINING OF POLICE OFFICERS
AND OTHER RESOURCES.
>> I'M GOING TO BE PROPOSINGSOME NEW COMMUNITY POLICING
INITIATIVES THAT WILLSIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND FUNDING
AND TRAINING FOR LOCAL LAWENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING UP TO
50,000 ADDITIONAL BODY-WORNCAMERAS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES.
>> Stephen: OH, GREAT TIMING,OBAMA.
YOU SHOULD HAVE ANNOUNCED ITON BLACK FRIDAY WHEN THOSE
BODY CAMERAS WERE 2 FOR 1 ATKOHL'S BEFORE 6 A.M.
TALK ABOUT TAX AND SPEND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESEDEMOCRATS.
NOW UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IDEAOF PUTTING THE CAMERAS ON
THE COPS HAS SOME SUPPORTFROM CONFUSED CONSERVATIVES.
>> THE CAMERAS PROTECTHONEST COPS AS WELL AS
DISCOURAGE POLICE ABUSE.
>> I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ONBODY CAMERAS.
AT ONE TIME I THOUGHT THEYWERE A MISTAKE.
NOW I BELIEVE THEY ARE AVERY GOOD IDEA.
>> I AM NOT SURPRISEDGIULIANI CHANGED HIS MIND.
HE IS IN FAVOR OF BEINGANYWHERE NEAR A CAMERA.
AND THE WHOLE THING-- THEWHOLE THING IS BASED ON A
FAULTY PREMISE.
AS ONE CALIFORNIA POLICECHIEF PUT IT WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU'RE BEING WATCHED, YOUBEHAVE A LITTLE BETTER.
THAT IS JUST HUMAN NATURE.
OH, YEAH, THAT IS WHY THOSEREAL HOUSEWIFES ARE SO WELL
BEHAVED.
FOLKS-- I GOT TO TELL YOU,IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,
THIS THEORY IS CLEARLY BULLHOCKEY.
AND I WILL PROVE IT RIGHTNOW.
JIMMY, TURN OFF MY CAMERAS.
GREAT, OKAY.
CAMERA OFF.
I'LL PROVE MY BEHAVIOR ISUNCHANGED.
EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY, LITTLECOUGH.
