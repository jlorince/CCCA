>> THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME BACK.
NOW FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I MAY NOT BE A HUGE FAN, BUT EVEN I HAVE GOT TO ADMIT THE
DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING ONE HELL OF A GREAT WEEK.
I MEAN IT WOULD TAKE AN ACT OF GOD TO SIDELINE THEM NOW.
HAS THERE BEEN ONE OF THOSE?
>> THE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION PLATFORM IS DRAWING FIRE.
THE WORD GOD APPEAR THOSE WHERE IN THE 1212 PLATFORM.
>> WHY WOULD THE DEMOCRATS REMOVE THE TERM GOD FROM THEIR PLATFORM.
>> TELL ME ABOUT THE GOD THING, WAS IT IN THERE AND THEY TOOK IT OUT.
WHAT HAPPENED.
>> IT HAS BEEN IN PREVIOUS PLATFORMS.
AND IT'S GONE NOW.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE.
PARTY PLATFORMS ALWAYS MENTION THE LORD, FOR PETE'S SAKE.
THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM IS JUST A PICTURE OF JESS WITH US A THOUGHT BUBBLE, GETTER DONE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE THING.
THIS IS AN INSULT, NOT ONLY TO GOD-FEARING AMERICANS BUT TO GOD HIMSELF.
FOLKS, HE'S VERY SENSITIVE.
(LAUGHTER) AND READ YOUR BIBLE, HE'S GOT A HAIR TRIGGER.
ONE LOOK AT A GOLDEN CAP AND YOUR CANTEEN IS FULL OF BLOOD.
AND OF COURSE THE DEMOCRATS CANNOT HIDE WHAT THEY'VE DONE FROM GOD.
BECAUSE HE GOOGLES HIMSELF CONSTANTLY.
(LAUGHTER) AND, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF DISING GOD WERE NOT ENOUGH, THE
DEMOCRATS ALSO DISSED GOD'S HOMETOWN.
>> FOUR YEARS AGO THE PLATFORM CLEARLY RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM AS THE PERPETUAL
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
BUT NOWHERE IN THIS YEAR'S PLATFORM DOES THAT STATEMENT EXIST.
>> WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE THAT JERUSALEM SHOULD BE THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AT A TIME
OF SUCH HIGH TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ESPECIALLY WITH IRAN.
>> TO CEASE CALLING JERUSALEM THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, THIS IS A VERY TROUBLING DEVELOPMENT.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A VERY TROUBLING DEVELOPMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> TO COMMITTED ZYONISTS LIKE A SEAN HANDITIES AND ME.
JERUSALEM OR YE YOU WEREA,
LAYIM AS WE CALL IT, THE ST ETERNAL CAP TAFL THE JEWISH STATE AND WE MUST STAND BY
OUR JEWISH FRIENDS, TO DEFEND THE TEMP EL MOUNT UNTIL THE DAY THAT CHRIST
RETURNS ON A CLOUD OF GLORY AND ALL NONCHRISTIANS ARE CONSUMED IN THE APOCALYPSE.
BUT REALLY, THANKS FOR KEEPING THE SEAT WARM FOR US.
OH, OH YER USAHA LAYIM, OH,
OH, OH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH YERUSAHLAYIM WHERE THE TEMP EL ONCE STOOD WHERE THE
CALLS STILL ECHO WITH THE IMPASSIONED ARGUMENTS OF RAF HILLEL AND RAF SHAMA.
WHERE YOU CAN GET A PHISH YALMULKE.
AT THE STORE NEXT TO THE MIKH DONAYES.
OH THAT KIND OF ITCHES BUT I WILL GIVE THIS TO THE DEMOCRATS.
ONCE THEY REALIZE THEIR DISTAKE, THEY DID THE RIGHT THING AND HUMANITY YATED THEMSELVES ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
HERE THEY ARE YESTERDAY VOTING WHETHER TO ADD GOD AND JERUSALEM BACK INTO THE PLATFORM.
>> ALL OF THOSE DELEGATES IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
>> AYE.
>> ALL THOSE DELEGATE OS POSED SAY NO.
>> NO.
>> I-- I GUESS-- I WILL DO THAT ONE MORE TIME.
ALL THOSE DELEGATES IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
>> AYE.
>> ALL THOSE DELEGATES OPPOSED SAY NO.
>> NO.
>> AND THE OPINION OF THE CHAIR TWO-THIRDS THE VOTED IN THE AFFIRMIVE-- AFFIRMATIVE, THE
MOTION IS ADOPTED.
>> OKAY.
ALL CLEANED UP.
BECAUSE A BASKETBALL ARENA FULL OF ANGRY PEOPLE SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS IS REALLY THE
BEST WAY TO MAKE DIFFICULT CALLS ON THE STATUS OF ISRAEL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS, FOR THE NEXT PEACE TALKS THEY JUST SHOULD PUT AN ISRAELI
AND A PALESTINIAN UP ON THE KISS CAM.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
