NIGHT.
NOW AS PROMISED LET'S TALKABOUT THAT PUTIN GUY.
HE'S GOT A FASCINATING OP EDIN TODAY'S "NEW YORK TIMES",
HOLD ON A SECRETARY, IFORGOT MY RAGE.

OH!
OH HHH, SLARM!
>> HOW DARE, HOW DARE-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HOW DARE "THENEW YORK TIMES" PRINT THE
PROPAGANDA OF A HOMICIDALKGB KLEPTO.
I ASSUME HE'S FILLING IN FORMAUREEN DOWD WHILE SHE ON
VACATION WITH PULLONIUM.SONG.
BECAUSE NEWS SPLASH, "NEWYORK TIMES", HE MURDEREDS
JOURNALISTS.
WE DON'T DO THAT IN AMERICA.
WE JUST LET YOU STARVE TODAYIN-- TO DEATH IN YOUR DYING
INDUSTRY.
AND JUST LOOK AT THIS CRAP,A PLEA FOR CAUTION FROM
RUSSIA, BY VLADIMIR V PUTIN.
BY THE WAY, THE V, STANDSFOR VLADIMIR.
(LAUGHTER)ANOTHER ONE, THAT'S HOW
RUSSIAN HE IS.
NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, THEGREAT LADY HAS GOT HER LEGS
SPREAD FOR VLAD THE IMPAILERHERE.
THEY'VE GOT A LONG HISTORYOF LEGITIMIZING IRONFISTED
TYRANTS.
IN THE 80Ses COULD WHOFORGET QADDAFI FRONT PAGE,
HOT FOR SPRING, MOO-MOOMANNIA.
OR IN THE 70s POL POT'SMISCONNECTIONS PAGE
CAMBODIAN PARANOID GENOCIDEOLOVER SEEKS EDUCATED CITY
DWELLER FOR LONG WALKS,BEAUTIFUL SUNSETS, NO
FATTIES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: AND THE THING
ITSELF IS A PIECE OF CRAP.
BASICALLY SAYING BLAH, BLAH,BLAH, DON'T ATTACK OUR
BUDDIES IN SYRIA, THE WORLDWOULDN'T LIKE IT, IT MIGHT
BE BAD FOR YOU.
BUT WHAT REALLY SCRAMBLED MYFABREGE EGG IS HOW PUTIN
ENDS IT BY QUESTIONING THEONE THING I LIKED ABOUT
OBAMA'S SYRIA SPEECH.
PUTIN WRITES, I WOULD RATHERDISAGREE WITH THE CASE HE
MADE ON AMERICANEXCEPTIONALISM.
FACING THAT THE UNITEDSTATES POLICY IS WHAT MAKES
AMERICA DIFFERENT, IT'S WHATMAKES US EXCEPTIONAL IT IS
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TOENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SEE
THEMSELVES AS EXCEPTIONAL.
[BLEEP] YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)VLAD!
THINKING YOU AREEXCEPTIONAL.
THINKING ARE YOU EXCEPTIONALIS NOT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
IT'S EXCEPTIONALLYDANGEROUS.

PUTIN I SAY WE USE LESBIANPILOTS FLYING THE ENOLA GAY.
