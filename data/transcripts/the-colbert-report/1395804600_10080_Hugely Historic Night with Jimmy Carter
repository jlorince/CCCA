AT A STATE DINNER.
I MADE A SCIENCE PROJECT WITHBILL CLINTON.
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, I PUTGEORGE WASHINGTON INTO A VENDING
MACHINE.
AND WHILE TOURING THE NATION'SCAPITAL, I EVEN SAT DOWN WITH
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

SADLY, HE DID NOT BRING THEGIFTS I WANTED THAT CHRISTMAS.
BUT I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW HUGETONIGHT IS.
THE SIZE OF THE HUGENESS --LARGE.
THIS NIGHT WILL GO DOWN IN THEANNALS OF EPIC CLASHES BETWEEN
JOURNALIST AND LEADER.
FROST NIXON.
WALLACE-KHOMEINI.
ASTEROID-FREEMAN.
BUT TONIGHT IS HISTORIC FORANOTHER REASON, BECAUSE
FOLLOWING OUR BROADCAST, THISEPISODE IS GOING TO BE PLAYED IN
PERPETUITY FOR VISITORS AT THECARTER PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND
MUSEUM IN PLAINS, GEORGIA.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]SO, RIGHT NOW, NOT ONLY AM I
SPEAKING TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLEWATCHING TV, I'M ALSO
SPEAKING TO SEVERAL DOZENTOURISTS SITTING ON BENCHES.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]HI, Y'ALL!

ASK SOMEONE.
