ALL RIGHT, PHILIP MUDD, 25YEARS IN THE INTELLIGENCE
WORLD.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CIA'SCOUNTERTERRORIST CENTER FROM
2003 TO 2005 THEN BECAME THEFBI SENIOR INTELLIGENCE
ADVISOR.
AND YOU HAVE A BOOK ENTITLEDTAKE DOWN, INSIDE THE HUNT
FOR AL QAEDA.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: DO WE REALLYTAKE DOWN AL QAEDA OR SHOULD
IT BE CALLED SPREAD OUTINSIDE THE SCATTERING OF AL
QAEDA.
>> I THINK IF YOU LOOKED ATTHE ADVERSARY WE FACE 12
YEARS AGO IT BEAR THOSERESEMBLANCE TO WHAT WE SEE
TODAY.
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T FACETHE AL QAEDA GROUP TODAY, WE
FACE THE REM NANTZ OF AREVOLUTION IN PLACES LIKE
YEMEN, SOME ALI.
THE ARCHITECTS ARE ALMOSTGONE BUT THE REVOLUTION THEY
INSPIRED LIVES ON.
>> Stephen: ARE WE STILL INDANGER?
>> I THINK WE ARE.
IF YOU LOOK AT HOME GROUP,PEOPLE WHO SIT AND LOOK AT A
COMPUTER AND IMAGES FROMPLACES LIKE GAZA, IRAQ,
AFGHANISTAN, THOSE KIDS AREINSPIRED BY EMOTION, TO SAY
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUTTHAT.
NOW THEY HAVE AN IDEAOLOGYTHEY ATTACH THEMSELVES TO
AND THAT IS CALLED AL QAEDA.
>> Stephen: SHOULD THE CIAHAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR
PHYSICAL INTELLIGENCE INPLACES OR SHOULD THEY BE
MORE WATCHING YOUTUBE TO SEEWHAT'S INSPIRING THESE KIDS.
>> LOOK F YOU WANT TOUNDERSTAND THE WAY A HUMAN
BEING THINKS, YOU NEED AHUMAN INFORMANT NEXT TO
THEM.
YOU CAN FIND OUT INFORMATIONFROM THE INTERNET, YOU CAN
FIND OUT INFORMATION FROMTELEPHONE INTERCEPTS FROM
E-MAILS BUT IN THE HISTORYOF TIME AND THAT HISTORY
HASN'T CHANGED IN 2013, YOUCAN'T BEAT A HUMAN
INFORMANT.

GENERAL PETRAEUS SAID OURMICROWAVES ARE SPYING ON US.

YOU JUST SAID NONSENSE ABOUTGENERAL PETRAEUS.

WE HAVE GREAT BOOKS, GREATPEOPLE, GREAT CAFES, GREAT
FOOD B 18 DOWN ON THAT LISTFOR ME IS TV.
WHICH TURNS YOUR BRAIN INTOCOTTON CANDY SO I DECIDED TO

YOUR BOOK RIGHT NOW.

RAINBOW.

HOW DARE YOU, SIR.
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT SYRIA.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUTSYRIA, RIGHT.
>> YES, I DO.
>> Stephen: THE BOTTOM LINESU SHOULD GO, RIGHT.
>> YES, CORRECT.
>> Stephen: THE AMERICANPEOPLE DON'T THINK SO.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
>> Stephen: HOW CAN WE -->> YOU DON'T CARE, WITH.
>> NO, I SAID I UNDERSTAND.
>> Stephen: OH, I THOUGHTYOU SAID YOU DON'T CARE.
BECAUSE-- I DON'T CARE.
OKAY, THEY GET THINGS WRONG.
IT'S OUR-- IT'S OUR GOAL TOLEAD THEM, RIGHT.
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO WHY DO YOU THINK THEYDON'T WANT TO GO?
>> BECAUSE I THINK THEY LOOKAT IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND
SAY TOO MANY BOYS AND GIRLS,MEN AND WOMEN FROM THIS
COUNTRY IS DIED IN WAR ANDTERRORIST EVENTS AND WE WANT
OUT.
WE'VE DONE WITH THIS.
>> Stephen: NOW I UNDERSTANDYOU HELP PREPARE COLIN
POWELL'S BEFORE THE U.N.
SAYING THERE WERE WEAPONS OFPASS DESTRUCTION.
>> I CAME UP WITH THE SPEECHAND CAME WITH HIM WHEN HE
GAVE THE SPOCH.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK HEACTUALLY HAD EVIDENCE THAT
THERE WAS WECHES OF MASSDESTRUCTION IN IRAQ BECAUSE
PEOPLE KEEP POINTING TO THATTESTIMONY AND GOING WE HEARD
THIS, THEY WEREN'T THERE,THAT'S WHY WE'RE RELUCTANT
TO GO INTO SYRIA.
>> I THINK THAT SAY REDHERRING.
FIRST THE U.N. IS ABOUT TOCOME OUT AND SAY THERE FROM
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED INSYRIA.
SO THAT IS A FUNDAMENTALLYDIFFERENT STORY FROM IRAQ.
BUT I WOULD GO BACK TOSEEING-- .
>> Stephen: THERE ARE DOUBTS,GUYS LIKE PUTIN ARE SAYING
MAYBE IT WASN'T THEGOVERNMENT THAT DID IT.
>> IT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN,WHAT THE HELL HE IS GOING TO
SAY.
>> Stephen: HE'S GOING TOSAY "NEW YORK TIMES", NEW
YORK FILES WOULD YOU PLEASEPRINT MY IDEAS WITH WITHOUT
COMMENT?
AND THEY DID, SO PEOPLE WILLREAD THAT AND BELIEVE HIM.
>> NO, THEY'RE NOT.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY WILL.
HAVE YOU -->> I DON'T THINK THE
QUESTION WMD.
I THINK THE QUESTION IS ATYRANT WHO HAS A RECKLESS
ABANDON WHEN HE MURDERSINNOCENCE.
AT WHAT POINT DOW DRAW ALINE AND SAY WE ARE NOT JUST
U.S. CITIZENS, WE'RE GLOBALCITIZENS.
ONE MORE THING, HISTORY F WETHINK OF WHERE WE'RE GO TO
BE IN 10 OR 20 YEARS WHATARE WE GOING TO TELL OUR
KIDS, THAT WE DIDN'T HAVETHE COURAGE BECAUSE WE WERE
AFRAID TO DEFEND AGAINST THEMURDZ OF 100,000 INNOCENTS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE FORTHAT.
>> Stephen: NOW WHEN DID YOULEAVE THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY.
>> 2010.
>> Stephen: 2010.
OKAY, YOU WERE GOING TO BEGIVEN A POSITION, THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELANDSECURITY AND QUESTIONS WERE
RAISED ABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGEOF ENHANCING INTERROGATION
AND YOU REMOVED YOURSELF.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: FROM THENOMINATION PROCESS.
>> SO FAR YOU GOT T THAT'SCORRECT.
>> Stephen: SO FAR I HAVEGOT T STOP ME WHEN I DON'T
HAVE IT ANY MORE.
WERE YOU INVOLVED INENHANCED INTERROGATION AND
DOW BELIEVE WE SHOULD BEDOING IT?
>> I WAS INVOLVED AND DEPUTYDIRECTED THE COUNTER TER
CYST CENTER THAT CONDUCTEDTHOSE INTERROGATION
TECHNIQUES AND HOUSED ALQAEDA PRISONERS.
I DON'T REGRET WHAT WE DIDTHEN BUT SINCE THENED
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD THETIME AND THE SPACE TO DEBATE
THIS ISSUE.
AND THEY'VE SAID WE DON'TLIKE IT AND WE DON'T WANT
OUR SECURITY SERVICES DOINGIT.
SO I RESPECT THAT, THESECURITY SERVICE IN A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY SERVED ATTHE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.
AND THE WILL OF THE PEOPLEHAS SPOKEN.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK ITMIGHT SWING BACK, WE GET
ATTACKED AGAIN.
>> NO WAY, NO WAY.
>> Stephen: IF WE GETATTACKED AGAIN.
>> NO WAY, DUDE, IT'S TO THEGOING TO HAPPEN.
FURTHERMORE F IT DID THEPEOPLE IN MY POSITION, AND I
WOULD DO THE SAME F I WERETHEM WOULD, SAY NO AND IF I
WERE WERE THERE I WOULDRESIGN, THAT AIN'T GOING
HAPPEN AGAIN.
