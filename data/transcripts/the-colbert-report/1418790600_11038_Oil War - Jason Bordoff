NOW, NATION, I GOTTA TELL YOU,TONIGHT I AM AS HAPPY AS A PIG
IN A CANDY STORE THAT ALLOWSPIGS.
JIM, TELL THE PEOPLE WHY.
>> GAS PRICES HAVE DROPPED TOTHEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2009.
>> A FEW SPENT, WHAT, $80FILLING UP YOUR S.U.V.
NOW YOU'RE SPENDING $60.
>> LOOK AT THE SIGN, $2.07 FOR AGALLON OF REGULAR.
>> YOU SEE GAS BELOW $2 IN THISPLACES.
>> YOU CAN FIND GAS FOR LESSTHAN $2 IN 13 STATES.
>> Stephen:  LESS THAN $2 AGALLON.
THAT IS SO CHEAP.
NOW, I DON'T JUST FILL UP MYTANK.
I FILL UP THE WHOLE DAMN CAR.
IT'S DANGEROUS.
IT'S EXCITING, BUT IT'SDANGEROUS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SO WHY THE SUDDEN DROP IN GASPRICES?
TV, TALK.
>> OIL PRICES BASICALLY IN AFREEFALL SINCE OPEC DECIDED NOT
TO SCALE BACK PRODUCTION.
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING, BECAUSE OFTHE RISE OF THE U.S. OIL
PRODUCERS, OPEC IS TRYING TOFLOOD THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY'RE
AFRAID WE'LL STEAL BUSINESS FROMTHEM.
>> OIL PRODUCTION HERE HASSOARED MORE THAN 70% IN THE PAST
SIX YEARS, SPURRED BY NEWHYDRAULIC FRACKING.
>> WHAT IS THE CARTEL HAS DONEIS EFFECTIVELY START A PRICE WAR
WITH THE UNITED STATES.
>> OIL WAR.
>> OIL WAR.
>> Stephen:  OIL WAR, IT'SAMERICA'S DEAD DINOSAURS VERSUS
SAUDI ARABIA'S DEAD DINOSAURS.
STEVEN SPIELBERG, RETURN MYCALLS.
YOU SEE, FOLKS, IN RESPONSE TOAMERICA BECOMING RICH-ASS MOTHER
FRACKERS, OPEC IS FIRING ITSFIRST SALVO IN THIS WAR BY
OPENING THE TAPS, ALLOWING THEPRICE OF CRUDE TO FALL TO A
LEVEL AT WHICH A LOT OF AMERICANCOMPANIES WOULD LOSE MONEY ON
THEIR SHALE OPERATIONS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
IF THE FRACKING BUSINESS GOESBUST, NORTH DAKOTA COULD BECOME
AN UNPOPULATED WASTELAND.
( LAUGHTER )ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS GREAT
NEWS FOR CONSUMERS, FOR THEECONOMY, AND FOR OUR GIANT CARS.
>> S.U.V. SALES ARE HOT AGAINTHANKS TO THE GAS PRICES.
>> LOW GAS PRICES ARE HELPINGSALES OVERALL, PARTICULARLY
AMONG BIGGER MODELS LIKES.U.V.s.

EDITION.
FOLKS, THAT IS AMERICANEXCEPTIONALISM.
WE SEIZE THE MOMENT.
CARPE GASUM.
I MEAN, FUEL IS CHEAP THIS WEEK.
GIVE ME A FIVE-YEAR LEASE ON AROLLING CARGO SHIP WITH THE
AERODYNAMICS OF A CINDER BLOCKBECAUSE I BELIEVE WE ARE NOW
LIVING IN A NONSTOP PETROLEUMPARTY THAT WILL NEVER, EVER END.
THAT'S JUST HOW MARKETS WORK.
HERE NOW TO TELL ME THAT'S NOTHOW MARKETS WORK IS THE DIRECTOR
OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTERON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY, JASON
BORDOFF.
JASON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORBEING HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SO THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT.
GAS PRICES HAVE COME DOWN.
THIS IS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S OILPARTY.
>> IT IS RIGHT RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, THENIT ALWAYS WILL BE.
>> OIL PRICES HAVE A FUNNY WAYOF GOING UP AND GOING DOWN.
THEY ALWAYS HAVE AND THEY ALWAYSWILL.
THEY'RE LOW RIGHT NOW-->> Stephen:  MAYBE THIS IS THE
TIME THEY DON'T THOUGH.
>> I WOULDN'T WANT TO BET ONTHAT.
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING ANEW CAR AND WILL HAVE IT 10, 15
YEARS, LIKE MOST PEOPLE, YOU'REBETTER OFF INVESTING IN A
FUEL-EFFICIENT CAR TO SAVE MOREMONEY DOWN THE ROAD
>> Stephen:  YEAH BUT THERE'SFUEL EFFICIENT AND THERE'S FUEL
EFFICIENT. I CAN GET A FUELEFFICENT SUV
I CAN DRIVE ALL THE PRIUSES INTHE WORLD RIGHT OFF THE SANTA
MONICA PIER RIGHT NOW, CAN'T I.
WHATEVER HANDED TO PEAK OIL?
I HEARD WE HAD RUN OUT OF OILIN THE WORLD, WE WOULDN'T FIND
ANY.
NOW IT'S LIKE OUR SUBSTRATE ISJUST A SLURRY OF HYDROCARBON HOT
POCKETS.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR ORFIVE TIMES IN AMERICAN HISTORY
WHERE PEOPLE THINK WE'RE RUNNINGOUT OF OIL, AND IT TURNS OUT
PEOPLE CAN BE PRETTY INNOVATIVE,AND WHEN THE PRICE IS HIGH THEY
DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEWWAYS TO EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS
FROM WANT GROUND.
>> Stephen:  HOW MUCH SURPLUSOIL DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW?
>> WE DON'T HAVE SURPLUS.
WE ARE STILL AN IMPORTER OF OILAND WILL BE AN IMPORTER AS FAR
AS THE EYE COULD SEE.
>> Stephen:  HOW ABOUT THEWORLD? THERE HAS TO BE
A LOT OF OIL IN THE WORLDBECAUSE THE PRICE IS GOING DOWN
>> THERE IS OIL IN-->> Stephen: DID I JUST TEACH
YOU ECONOMICS?
I THINK I JUST TAUGHT YOUECONOMICS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THEY'RE SO DEPENDENT ON OIL, ISTHERE A CHANCE THAT HE MIGHT NOT
BE ELECTED MISS RUSSIA NEXTYEAR?
>> RUSSIA IS IN SEVERE ECONOMICSTRAITS.
THEIR ECONOMY IS ON THE VERGE OFCOLLAPSE.
THEIR CURRENCY, THE RUBLE, HASFALLEN OFF A CLIFF IN THE LAST
FEW DAYS.
>> Stephen:  ISN'T THIS AGREAT ARGUMENT-- THE ARGUMENT
FOR HAVING CHEAP GAS IS THAT ITDESTROYS OUR ENEMIES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
BECAUSE IF WE HAVE CHEAP GAS,ISN'T IT-- WHAT I'M SAYING IS
AREN'T THOSE OF US ON THECONSERVATIVE PRO-FRACKING SIDE,
AREN'T WE THE ONES WHO ARERIGHT.
WE HAVE CHEAP GAS, IT'SDESTROYING THE RUSSIANS, AND IT
WEAKENS SOME QUESTIONABLE ALLIESIN THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> INCREASING AMERICAN OILPRODUCTION, RENIEWS CADUCEUSING
OUR IMPORTS, CUTTURE MARKETSHARE FOR VENEZUELA, IRAN,
RUSSIA-- THESE ARE COUNTRIES WEHAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR
BEHAVIOR.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE SANCTIONSAGAINST RUSSIA AND IRAN.
AMERICA IS MORE ENERGY SECURE,BECAUSE WE INCREASED PRODUCTION
AND REDUCED CONSUMPTION.
>> Stephen:  HOW BAD COULDTHINGS GET FOR THE OPEC NATIONS.
ARE THE SAUDIS GOING TO HAVE TOTIGHTEN THEIR BELT BELTS?
AND A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, COTHEYWEAR BELTS?
>> THE SAUDIS ARE BETTER OFFTHAN OTHERS.
THEY HAVE ABOUT $1 TRILLION INRESERVE.
COUNTRIES LIKE VENEZUELA, LIKERUSSIA, LIKE IRAN, THAT NEED
130, $140, BARREL OF OIL JUST TOBALANCE THEIR BUDGETS ARE AT THE
RISK OF DEFAULT AND REALECONOMIC CHAOS RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen:  SO SORRY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGME.
JASON BORDOFF.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
