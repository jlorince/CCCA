PLACE YOURSELF IN THAT MAP THATGIVES YOU A SENSE OF MEANING, OF
WHERE YOU ARE, OF HOW YOU CAMETO BE AND WHAT THINGS YOU CAN

IT'S CALLED THE BIBLE.

>> WELL --(LAUGHTER).
THERE ARE MANY ORIGIN STORIESAND THE BIBLE IS ONE.
>> Stephen: IT'S THE TRUE ONE.
>> MANY, MANY COUNTRIES ANDDIFFERENT SOCIETIES HAVE THEIR
OWN ORIGIN STORIES AND MODERNSCIENCIST CONTAINS AN ORIGIN
STORY.
SO WHAT WE'RE TELLING IS THE ORGIN STORY PRESENT IN MODERN
SCIENCE.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THATCONFUSES ME ABOUT THE SHOW IS IT
CONNECTS WIDELY DISPARATETHINGS.
LIKE -- GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONEOF THE THINGS.
YOUR FIRST EPISODE IS ABOUTSALT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THE WHOLE EPISODEJUST ABOUT SALT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OBVIOUSLY THAT'SJUST A RATINGS GRAB BECAUSE
PEOPLE --(LAUGHTER).
NEXT WEEK IT'S SWEET.
SALT AND SWEET.
>> BUT IF YOU'LL REMEMBER THATTHE EARLY EARTH FOUR BILLION
YEARS AGO THE FIRST LIVINGORGANISMS WERE FORMED IN SALTY
WATER SO ALL LIVING ORGANISMS ONEARTH WERE FORMED IN THE SORT OF
SALT SOLUTION.
WE NEED TO CARRY IT AROUNDINSIDE OUR BODIES SO THE STORY
OF SALT -->> Stephen: WAIT, THERE'S A
SALT SOLUTION IN MY BODY.
>> YOU NEED SALT.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE SALT I HATE TOSAY IT BUT YOU WILL DIE
EVENTUALLY:(LAUGHTER).

>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT SALARYCOMES FROM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
E YOU ENJOYINGMY HISTORY COURSE?

>> Stephen: SAYS YOU, BUT GOAHEAD, YEAH.
>> 4.56 BILLION YEARS AGO THEEARTH WAS CREATED.
GREAT THING.
65 MILLION YEARS AGO AN ASSROEUTD LANDED ON EARTH, WIPED
OUT THE DINOSAURS.
IF THE DINOSAURS HADN'T BEENWIPED OUT WE WOULD NOT BE HERE.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE WE'D BEFIGHTING THEM.
(LAUGHTER)WE'D BE FIGHTING THEM, RIGHT!
THIS SHOULD BE WOULD BEGLADIATORS FIGHTING DINOSAURS
AND ITS RATINGS WOULD BEENORMOUS.
WHAT'S BILL GATES GET OUT OFTHIS?
WHERE IS HE GETTING HIS BEAKWET?
HE LOVES THE CASH.
>> HE'S NOT GETTING CASH, HELOVES THE EDUCATIONAL IDEA OF
THE COURSE THAT BRINGS THEDIFFERENT SUBJECTS TOGETHER.
I MEAN, I REMEMBER GOING TOSCHOOL WANTING TO A STORY ABOUT
THE MEANING OF LIFE AND MYTEACHERS SAY TO ME THINGS LIKE
-- AND THIS IS THEIR JOB.
THEY SAY "SHUT UP ABOUT THEMEANING OF LIFE.
LEARN ABOUT CALCULUS OR YOURFRENCH VERBS OR SOMETHING LIKE
THIS."
NEVER COULD I STUDY OR ASK ABOUTTHE MEANING OF LIFE IN SCHOOL OR
UNIVERSITY.
WITH A COURSE LIKE THIS, YOU CANPUT ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER,
YOU CAN SEE A COHERENT STORY OFTHE WHOLE OF THE PAST AND IT'S
FULL OF MEANING.
>> Stephen: WELL, DAVID, WHATIS THE MEANING OF LIFE?
>> THE MEANING OF LIFE -- OKAY.
UM --(LAUGHTER).
HERE'S THE QUICK VERSION.
>> Stephen: I KIND OF DO NEEDTHE QUICK VERSION.
>> 13.8 BILLION YEARS AGO THEUNIVERSE APPEARS.
IT'S THAT SMALL, EVERYTHING INTHE UNIVERSE IS IN THAT TINY
THING.
IT'S INCREDIBLY SIMPLE, NOHUMANS, NO PLANETS, NO ELEMENTS.
THEN OVER 13.8 BILLION YEARS ONEBY ONE NEW MORE COMPLEX THINGS
APPEAR.
STARS APPEAR.
PLANETS APPEAR.
LIVING ORGANISMS-- AT LEAST ONTHIS PLANET-- AND THEN
EVENTUALLY US.
THE WEIRDEST ORGANISMS OF ALL.
SO THAT'S A WONDERFUL STORYABOUT HOW WE GOT TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE EVENTSOF LIFE, THAT'S NOT THE MEANING
OF LIFE.
>> THE MEANING IS LIKE A MAP.
IF YOU HAVE A MAP IT TELLS YOUWHERE YOU ARE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IF YOU KNOW WHEREYOU ARE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN
GO.
>> Stephen: IF YOU KNOW WHATTHE KEY SAYS IN THE CORNER OF
THE MAP!
(LAUGHTER)TO TELL YOU DISTANCE AND
EVERYTHING.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE IS.
THE BIBLE IS THE KEY IN THECORNER.
>> THE BIBLE IS A MAP.
IT'S A WONDERFUL MAP, FULL OFMEANING.
>> Stephen: IT'S THE MAP,MR. CHRISTIAN.
