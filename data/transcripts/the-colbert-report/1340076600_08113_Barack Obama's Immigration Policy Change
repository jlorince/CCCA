(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN.
>> WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
OR SHOULD I SAY BUENOS.
BECAUSE ON FRIDAY EL PRESIDENTIAL BARAK OBAMA ANNOUNCED IN A ROSE GARDEN
CEREMONY THAT HE WILL NOT BE DEPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BROUGHT HERE AS CHILDREN WHO
HAVE THE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND NO CRIMINAL RECORD.
THIS OF COURSE REPLACES OUR LONG-STANDING POLICY OF NOT DEPORTING THEM IF THEY WERE
REALLY GOOD AT BASEBALL.
THIS IS SHOCKING, SHOCKING,
OBAMA HAS NOW THROWN UP MERCK'S DOORS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HERE.
NOW WE CAN EXPECT A STEADY STREAM OF PREEXISTING POURING INTO THEIR PRESENT
LOCATION AND WE ALL KNOW WHY HE IS DOING THIS.
>> IN THE EVE OF THE ELECTION IT LOOKS POLITICAL.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DECISION HERE IS POLITICAL.
HE'S DOING RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION.
AND IT VERY TRANSPARENT POLITICAL FASHION.
>> THIS IS FOG BUT A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND CYNICAL ACT.
>> THANK YOU ST. CARL.
YES.
THIS IS CYNICAL.
OBAMA NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING TO ATTRACT HISPANIC VOTERS IN NOVEMBER AND RIGHT NOW
HE'S BARELY CLINGING TO A 43 POINT LEAD.
SOUNDS IMPRESSIVE BUT REMEMBER THAT'S IN PESOS.
BOTTOM LINE, FOLKS-- BOTTOM LINE, FOLKS, I AND ALL MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS KNOW THAT
THIS WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO.
>> I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO, ACTUALLY.
>> THIS A GOOD WAY TO DO IT WITH A GOOD POLICY.
>> IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> Stephen: FINE, BUT THE PRESIDENT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO ANYTHING IN AN ELECTION YEAR.
LET ALONE THE RIGHT THING.
NOW MAYBE I AM A CONSPIRACY THEORIST BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT BARACK OBAMA
IS TRYING TO GET RE-ELECTED.
YOU DON'T SEE REPUBLICANS CYNICALLY PANDERING TO LATINOS LIKE THIS.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE GOP'S HISPANIC OUTREACH WEB PAGE.
LAST WEEK THE FRONT BANNER FEATURED A STOCK PHOTO OF ASIAN CHILDREN.
I MEAN I THINK THAT IS WONDERFUL.
IT'S THE PROMISE OF AMERICA.
THESE KIDS CAN GROW UP TO BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO BE,
EVEN HISPANIC.
MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE, FOLKS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT PANDERING, JUST LOOK AT WHAT
THE DEMOCRATIC LOGO IS.
A BUREAU.
AND I'M SURE IF YOU HIT IT WITH A STICK CANDY AND FREE HEALTH CARE FALLS OUT.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU-- I'LL TELL YOU-- BUT I'LL TELL YOU
I DON'T THINK HISPANICS ARE GOING TO FALL FOR OBAMA'S WILL PLOY OF PROMISING TO
HELP AND THEN DOING IT.
THEY WANT A MAN OF PRINCIPLES.
A MAN WHO WILL PROMISE NOT TO HELP AND THEN WON'T.
>> THE QUESTION IS IF I WERE ELECTED AND CONGRESS WERE TO PASS THE DREAM ACT WOULD I
VETO IT AND THE ANSWER IS YES.
FOR THOSE THAT COME HERE ILLEGALLY THE IDEA OF GIVING THEM IN STATE TUITION
CREDITS OR OTHER SPECIAL BENEFITS I FIND TO BE CONTRARY TO THE IDEA OF A NATION OF LAWS.
THE ANSWER IS DEPORTATION WHICH IS PEOPLE DECIDE THAT THEY CAN DO BETTER BY GOING
HOME BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK HERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION TO
ALLOW THEM TO WORK HERE.
>> YES, IF MITT ROMNEY IS ELECTED ILLEGALS WILL SELF-DEPORT.
IN FACT, SOME AMERICANS MIGHT EVEN JOIN THEM.
BUT FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE)
