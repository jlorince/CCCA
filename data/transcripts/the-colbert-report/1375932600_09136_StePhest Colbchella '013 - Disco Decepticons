>> Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
NATION, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO
THE TOP STORY TONIGHT-- ME.
( LAUGHTER )
THE WORLD IS ABUZZ OVER LAST
NIGHT'S SHOW.
IT WAS MY THIRD ANNUAL
COLBCHELLA CONCERT SERIES AND IT
WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE THIRD
TIME WE HAVE DONE IT.
( LAUGHTER )
MY STAR-STUDDED VIDEO TRIBUTE TO
THE SONG OF THE SUMMER LIT UP
THE TWITTERSPHERE, THOUGH I DO
HAVE TO SAY, I AM A LITTLE HURT
THAT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH PEOPLE
HAVE CONGRATULATED ME ON THE
HEIGHT OF MY CHORUS LINE KICK
WITH THE ROCKETTES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YES.
I AM DEEPLY HURT IN THAT I
BELIEVE I TORE MY HAMS STRING.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, FOLKS, IF YOU WEREN'T HERE
LAST NIGHT, YOU'RE PROBABLY IN
DAFT PUNK.
( LAUGHTER )
THESE GUYS-- THEY WERE A NO-SHOW
BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED EXCLUSIVE
AGREEMENT TO APPEAR ON MTV, I
ASSUME BECAUSE THEY'RE 16 AND
PREGNANT.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT IT TURNS OUT, IT TURNS OUT--
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT-- BUT IT
TURNS OUT, AS I EXPLAINED IN
MINUTE DETAIL LAST NIGHT, THAT
ARE SURPRISE GUESTS AT THIS
YEAR'S VMA'S, SO REMEMBER TO ACT
SURPRISED.
BUT IT ALL TURNED OUT GREAT
BECAUSE ROBIN THICKE SHOWED UP
AT THE LAST MINUTE TO KICK IT
WILD STYLE.
END OF STORY, OR SO I THOUGHT.
UNTIL SOME SHARP-EYED
JOURNALISTS OVER AT THE INDY
MUSIC SITE PITCHFORK QUESTIONED
THE HONESTY OF MY EXPLANATION
SARCASTICALLY USING, "MAYBE
ROBIN THICKE, HIS DANCERS AND
BAND WERE ABLE TO PULL OFF AN
ELABORATE PERFORMANCE TWO HOURS'
NOTICE OR MAYBE IT WAS THE PLAN
ALL ALONG, AN ELABORATE FAKE-OUT
TO PROMOTE DAFT PUNK'S
APPEARANCE ON THE VMA'S.
I GOT ONE THING TO SAY TO
PITCHFORK-- BUSTED!
YOU GOT ME!
THEY'RE GOOD.
WE THOUGHT WE TRICKED YOU BY
FLYING IN THE DISCO DECEPTICONS
FROM PARIS IN A IT SOPHISTICATE
PANTOMIME TO FOOL EVERYONE, EVEN
MYSELF, SO COMMITTED WAS I.
THAT DAFT PUNK WAS COMING.
ALL-- ALL JUST TO HELP SOMEONE
ELSE'S SHOW ON ANOTHER NETWORK A
MONTH FROM NOW.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT WE CAN'T PUT ONE PAST YOU,
PITCH FORNG.
OH, WHAT A LOAD OFF.
THE GUILT WAS KILLING ME.
AND NOW THAT I'VE COME CLEAN, I
CAN JUST DO WHAT I LOVE, PROMOTE
THE VMAs.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WHICH ONCE AGAIN-- THANK YOU.
IT'S MY CALLING.
ONCE AGAIN, THE VMAs THE
APPEAR ON THE OPRAH WINFREY
NETWORK, FOLLOWING THE PREMIERE
OF "HYSTERECTOMY HORRORS" WITH
HOST LOU DIAMON
