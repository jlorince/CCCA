THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT YOU TELLS ME
YOU'D BE VERY GENEROUS LOVERS.
[LAUGHTER]
TONIGHT, FOLKS, TWO BIG STORIES.
FIRST UP, WISCONSIN, WHERE
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER HAS
BRAVELY STRIPPED COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING RIGHTS FROM STATEEE
STATEEES -- EMPLOYEES.
BRAVO, SIR.
WALKER'S BILL IS BEING
CHALLENGED AS LEGALITY IS RULED
ON BY THE SUPREME COURT.
A DECISION BY THE PEOPLE OF
WISCONSIN -- A WEIGHTY DECISION
BY THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN WHICH
IS SAYING SOMETHING BECAUSE OF
THE WEIGHT OF THE PEOPLE FROM
WISCONSIN.
ONE OF JUDGES UP COURT WAS UP
FOR REELECTION.
IF HE LOSES THAT IT FLIPS THE
MAJORITY FOR THE LIBERALS AND IT
PHAOPBSZ A VICTORY FOR THE
UNIONS.
IT THE RACE IS BETWEEN INCUMBENT
JUSTICE AND SCOTT WALKER MENTOR
DAVID PROSSER AND HIS CHALLENGER
CARTOON SOUND EFFECT JOANNE
KLOPPENBURG.
THE RACE IS NOW CLOSE BECAUSE
ANGRY LIBERALS ARE USING THIS AS
A REFERENDUM ON WALKER.
JUDGE PROSER IS HAS A -- PROSSER
HAS A STERLING REP REPUTATION
DONE ONLY BY THINGS HE HAD SAID
AND DONE.
>> YOU SCREAMED AT A JUSTICE
THAT SHE WAS A BITCH AND
THREATENING TO DESTROY HER.
>> I SAID SOMETHING I SHOULD NOT
HAVE SAID AND THAT I REGRET AND
I APOLOGIZE FOR.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I WANT PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND I DIDN'T SUDDENLY
HOP OUT WITH THIS ILL-ADVISED
STATEMENT WITHOUT ANY
PROVOCATION.
>> Stephen: THERE.
HE REGRETS CALLING HER A BITCH.
ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE WAS BEING
A TOTAL BITCH.
[LAUGHTER]
WITH 100% OF PRECINCTS REPORTING
KLOPPENBURG LEADS BY 204 VOTES
OUT OF OVER A MILLION.
WE'RE CLEARLY HEADED FOR A
RECOUNT.
THE RACE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO
STRIP THE BARGAINING RIGHTS OF
STATE WORKERS IS NOW IN THE
HANDS OF D OH, MY GOD, STATE
WORKERS.
