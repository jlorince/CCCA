>> WHAT MIRRIAD HAS DONE ISTO FIND A WAY TO BRING
BRANDS AND GREAT CONTENTTOGETHER, BY CREATING A
LOGICAL AND SEAMLESSINTEGRATION OF BRANDS INTO
GREAT CONTENT.
ADVERTISING IS THECRIT-- CRITICAL INGREDIENT
IN BRINGING GREAT CONTENT TOCONSUMERS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,ADVERTISING IS THE CRITICAL
INGREDIENT IN GREAT CONTENTWHICH IS WHY HBO HAS NEVER
PRODUCED ANYTHING WORTHWATCHING.
EVEN THEY ADMIT IT'S NOT TV.
MIRRIAD MAKES GREAT CON ATANY TIME POSSIBLE BY
RETROACTIVELY INSERTINGBRANDS INTO RERUNS.
JUST LOOK HOW THEY HAVETAKEN THIS OLD EPISODE OF
USA'S WHITE COLLAR ANDTURNED A NONDESCRIPT
