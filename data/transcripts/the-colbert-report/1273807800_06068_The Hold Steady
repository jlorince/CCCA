MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW ALBUM
CALLED "HEAVEN IS WHENEVER."
WELL, I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
HELL RIGHT NOW.
PLEASE WELCOME SOME OF THE BAND.
TAD, CRAIG, THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT IN THIS
BUILDING BY THE YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT YOU ARE HERE.
>> LIKE 35 TO 40-YEAR-OLDS.
>> Stephen: REALLY, REALLY
SUPER EXCITED.
YOU GUYS ARE ROCK STARS.
>> WE ARE IN A ROCK 'N' ROLL
BAND.
>> YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE NOT LIKE
GRAPHIC DESIGNERS?
>> LAST TIME I CHECKED WE WERE
FULLY EMPLOYED AS A ROCK 'N'
ROLL BAND.
>> Stephen: THE NAME OF YOUR
ALBUM IS "HEAVEN IS WHENEVER."
HEAVEN IS NOT A TIME.
HEAVEN IS A PLACE.
OKAY.
IT IS CLOUDS, GOD, NAKED BABIES
WITH WINGS.
EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY HEAVEN IS
WHENEVER?
>> I THINK HEAVEN IN THE
CHRISTIAN SENSE IS AN ULTIMATE
REWARD.
>> Stephen: RIGHT BECAUSE
WE'RE GOOD.
>> I THINK IF YOU'RE GOOD THEN
EVERY DAY YOU'RE REWARDED WITH A
GOOD LIFE AND YOU HAVE JOY IN
YOUR LIFE, AND I THINK BY LIVING
A RIGHTEOUS LIFE YOU'RE,
REWARDED EVERY DAY.
THAT'S WHAT HEAVEN IS WHENEVER
MEANS TO ME.
>> THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING
MOTHER TERESA SAID.
WHEN ASKED IF WE WERE HOLY, SHE
SAID WE'RE ALL HOLY AND THAT'S A
NATURAL STATE.
I SHOULDN'T BE AMAZED WHEN
SOMEONE IS HOLY.
MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS DO YOU
RIP OFF MOTHER THERESA A LOT?
>> CHAD'S THE GUITAR PLAYER.
>> Stephen: THIS IS NOT THAT
USUAL FOR THE ROCK CROWD, THE
RELIGIOUS IMAGERY, THE
CATHOLICS.
WHO IS CATHOLIC, ANYBODY?
>> I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.
>> Stephen: RAISED CATHOLIC OR
CATHOLIC?
>> I STILL GO TO CHURCH, BUT I
DON'T THINK THE POPE WOULD AGREE
WITH MY VERSION OF CATHOLICISM.
>> Stephen: WELL, THERE'S THE
DOOR, BUDDY.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
IT'S YAWWAY OR THE HIGHWAY.
YOU SAY OUR PSALMS ARE
SING-ALONG PSALMS.
WHAT IS A SING-ALONG PSALM.
>> THE SING-ALONG PSALM IS THE
LYRIC.
OUR SONGS ARE SING-ALONG SONGS.
I THINK IT MEANS PEOPLE IN OUR
GENERATION TAKE INSPIRATION FROM
ROCK 'N' ROLL IN A WAY THAT CAN
BE AT TIMES LIKE A RELIGIOUS
EXPERIENCE OR TAKE ON THAT MUCH
MEANING.
>> ARE THERE INFLUENCES THAT YOU
HAVE THAT DID THAT FOR YOU?
WHO WAS YOUR ROCK PROPHET?
IS IT GLENN BECK?
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE YOU KNOW GOD IS TALKING
TO HIM.
>> I THINK WE ALL LOVE LED
ZEPPELIN, BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, THE
ROLLING STONES, THE
REPLACEMENTS.
>> Stephen: THE ROLLING
STONES?
GOD IS TALKING TO MICK JAGGER
AND KEITH RICHARDS.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING TO
KEITH?
TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF,
BUDDY, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
>> SOMEONE IS WATCHING OUT FOR
KEITH RICHARDS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE.
HE'S GOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL.
I THINK IT'S JOHNNY DEPP.
NOW, WOULD YOU HANG AROUND?
WOULD YOU... YOU GOT THE STUFF
HERE.
WOULD YOU ROCK US OUT AND HIP US
TO YOUR SPIRITUAL VISION?
>> I THINK WE'D LOVE.
TO.
>> Stephen: WELL, WE WILL BE
RIGHT BACK IN THAT CASE WITH
CRAIG
