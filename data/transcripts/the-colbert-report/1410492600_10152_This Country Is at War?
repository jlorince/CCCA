NO RELIGION CONDONES THE KILLINGOF INNOCENTS.
>> WHY WON'T HE CALL ISIS WHATTHEY REALLY ARE--
SLAMIC EXTREMISTS.
>> HE SAID THE ISLAMIC STATE INTHE LEVANT IS NOT ISLAMIC.

IF AN ISLAMIST IS NOT ANISLAMIST, DOES THE BIRD TWEET IN
THE TREE?

IF SOMETHING CALLS ITSELFSOMETHING, IT IS THAT THING,
JUST LIKE ALL ENGLISH MUFFINSARE BAKED IN ENGLAND.

THEY'RE A WELL-MARBLED PEOPLE.
BUT, FOLKS, I-- IT'S NOT JUST"ISLAMIC" HE WOULDN'T SAY.
BRITT HUME NOTICED THAT THEREARE OTHER WORDS THAT DID NOT
APPEAR IN THE SPEECH.
>> IT SEEMS THAT ONE WOULD DOWHATEVER IT TAKES TO ELIMINATE
THE THREAT.
HE DIDN'T QUITE GO THAT FAR.
HE SAID WE'D DO WHAT IT TAKES.
HE DIDN'T SAY WE'D DO WHATEVERIT TAKES.
>> Stephen:  HE DIDN'T SAY THEWORD "WHATEVER."
I MEAN, AT LEAST HE COULD HAVETODAY WE'RE GOING TO KILL
ISIS OR WHATEVS.
WORDS MATTER, SIR.

OR, WHATEVER, WHATEVER,MR. PRESIDENT.
THEN, MY FRIEND BRITT HEREPERFECTLY SUMMED UP WHAT FELT SO
WRONG ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'STONE.
>> THERE IS A CERTAIN UN-- WHATI MIGHT CALL A CERTAIN
UNCERTAINTY IN ALL OF THIS INTHE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET HE IS
