>> Stephen:  HEY, LOOK AT
THAT.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT IN HERE,
OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA AND ALL
THE SHIPS AT SEA.
FOLKS, IF YOU ARE REGULAR
VIEWERS OF THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I
DON'T COVER A LOT OF
INTERNATIONAL EVENTS.
I SAY IF NEWS WANTS ME TO CARE
ABOUT IT, IT SHOULD HAVE PLANNED
AHEAD AND HAPPENED IN AMERICA.
THINK, THINK, OKAY?
BUT, FOLKS, LAST WEEK A MAJOR
STORY BROKE THAT AFFECTS ME
PERSONALLY.
THEY HELD ELECTIONS IN IRAN, AND
THEN THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED,
THEY COUNTED THE VOTES.
>> A CLERIC HAS BEEN ELECTED TO
REPLACE THE CONTROVERSIAL
MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD.
>> THE NEW PRESIDENT OF IRAN
WILL BE HASSAN ROUHANI.
>> THIS IS A CANDIDATE WHO HAS
COME IN AND INJECTED SOME
OPTIMISM AND HOPE.
>> HE SPOKE OF REFORM.
>> AND HE PROMISED GREATER
PERSONAL FREEDOMS.
>> Stephen:  YES, IRAN HAS
ELECTED A MODERATE, WHICH MEANS
INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR ISRAELIS
TO BE DRIVEN INTO THE SEA,
THEY'LL BE NUDGED INTO A LAKE.
SOUNDS REFRESHING.
HOW U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE NEW
IRANIAN LEADERS WILL PLAY OUT
ONLY TIME WILL TELL, FOLKS, BUT
THE BIGGER STORY IS THAT AFTER
EIGHT YEARS, WE'RE FINALLY
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO PRESIDENT
MAHMOUD
AHMA-NA-NAAA-NA-NA-NA-NAAA-HEY-E
YYY-NEJAAD.
MAHMOUD, OF COURSE, IS KNOWN FOR
A NUMBER OF QUESTIONABLE
CHOICES, THREATENING TO WIPE
ISRAEL OFF THE MAP, DENYING THE
HOLOCAUST HAPPENED, AND MOST
OFFENSIVELY, NEVER WEARING A TIE
WITH A SUIT.
EVIDENTLY, THEY DON'T HAVE
FATHER'S DAY OVER THERE.
OF COURSE, MY RIVALRY WITH
MAHMOUD GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO
2006 WHEN I WAS PROMISED THE
COVER OF "NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE AND
THE AXIS OF STUBBLE OVER HERE
GOT WIND OF THAT SO HE STARTS
DEVELOPING NUKES JUST TO GET
HIMSELF ON THE COVER AND PUSH ME
UP TO THE GOLDEN CORNER.
POINT-- MAHMOUD.
BUT SEVEN YEARS LATER, MAHMOUD'S
GONE, "NEWSWEEK'S" GONE, AND
LOOK WHO'S STILL HERE.
FOLKS, I'D SAY I WON HISTORY.
OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE THING I
WILL MISS, NEVER KNOWING HOW TO
PRONOUNCE HIS LAST NAME.
AHMA...MAH...-- JIMMY, JUST ROLE
THE TAPE-EJAD.
PRESIDENT-- OH, BOY, LET'S SEE
IF I CAN GET THIS RIGHT.
AH-MA-NINININI-JIHAD.
HELP ME.
HELP ME GET MY MOUTH AROUND THIS
CRAZY NAME.
AHMA-OLLYOLLYOXENFREE-NIJAD.
AH-MA-WEJUSTWONANEMMY-IJAD.
AHMAD-IN-SPACE-NO-ONE-CAN-HEAR-Y
AHMAD-IN-SPACE-NO-ONE-CAN-HEAR-Y
OU-SCREAM-IJAD.
AH-I-HEART-NEW-YORK-EJAD.
ACH-MAAA-WE-COME-FROM-THE-LAND-O
ACH-MAAA-WE-COME-FROM-THE-LAND-O
F-THE-ICE-AND-SNOW-IJAD.
I'M JUST GLAD ROUHANI IS SO MUCH
EASIER TO SAY THAN AHMADINEJAD.
WAIT!
I JUST DID IT!
COME BACK, MAHMOUD!
OH, WELL.
OH, WELL.
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
NOW THAT THIS ATROCITY IS
HISTORY, I WILL JUST DO WHAT HE
WILL DO,
