CRONKITE.
FOLKS, FOR YET ANOTHER DAY
PROTESTS RAGE ON IN WISCONSIN
AGAINST GOVERNOR WALKER'S HEROIC
BILL TO END COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING FOR STATE UNIONS.
THESE PROTESTERS HAVE ALREADY
LOST THE PUBLIC SUPPORT.
AS THE BROWN HAEURD GUY WHO IS
NOT STEVE DOOCY EXPLAINS.
>> THIS IS THE QUESTION POSED.
DO YOU FAVOR OR ARE YOU IN
DISFAVOR OF TAKING AWAY
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHEN IT
COMES TO SALARIES OF GOVERNMENT
WORKERS.
61% IN FAVOR OF TAKING IT AWAY,
33% OPPOSED.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE FICKLE AS
THE BROWN HAIRED GUY WHO IS NOT
STEVE DOOCY KNOWS TOO WELL.
>> I'LL CORRECT A POLL WE DID 22
MINUTES AGO FROM GALLUP.
61% OPPOSE TAKING COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING AWAY.
33% IN FAVOR.
I HAD IT REVERSED.
I APOLOGIZE.
>> Jon: I.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE IS APOLOGIZING.
I'M SEEN IT BOTH WAYS.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
CONFUSED, FOLKS.
IT'S NO WONDER.
THESE PROTESTERS KEEP THROWING
US OFF WITH THIS CHARADE OF
MIDWESTERN REASONABLENESS.
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF ANGER
HERE?
>> YES, WE'RE VERY UPSET.
>> WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY OUT
HERE.
EVERYBODY.
>> WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT
OPINIONS AND WE CAN STILL BE
CIVIL ABOUT IT.
>> I WANT TO SUPPORT ALL MY
TEACHERS BECAUSE I LIKE THEM A
LOT.
>> Stephen: BROWN NOSE ALL YOU
WANT, LITTLE GIRL, YOU ARE STILL
GOING TO BE A B ON THAT DIARAMA.
IT WAS A COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING
CAPITOL BUILDING.
WE CANNOT FALL FOR THE TROJAN
REGULAR FOLKS.
THAT'S WHY.
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT AN IDEA
FROM FORMER TEA PARTY EXPRESS
CHAIRMAN MARK WILLIAMS.
I SAY FORMER BECAUSE HE RUFFLED
FEATHERS WHEN HE CLAIMED THE
NAACP MAKES MORE MONEY OFF RACE
THAN ANY SLAVE TRADER EVER.
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
HE IS JUST PRAISING THE NAACP
FOR THE EXCELLENT BUSINESS MODEL
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO BEAT
SLAVERY FOR BRINGING IN THE
CASH.
HE CALLED ON THE FELLOW TEA
PARTYERS TO GO TO THE SERVICE
EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION
WEB SITE AND SIGN UP TO SPORT
UNION GOONS IN WISCONSIN AND
SHOW UP IN SEIU SHIRTS, TARGET
THE TV CAMERAS AND PULL OUT
SIGNS THAT SAY THINGS LIKE SCREW
THE TAXPAYER AND YOU OWE ME IN
ORDER TO MAKE IT LOOK AS GREEDY
AND GOONISH AS WE KNOW IT IS.
THIS IS BRILLIANT, FOLKS.
WE KNOW THAT GOVERNMENT WORKERS
ARE GREEDY GOONS BECAUSE WE KEEP
SAYING THAT THEY ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE THEY REFUSE TO LIVE UP TO
OUR STEREOTYPES, WE MUST DO IT
FOR THEM AND THEN THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WILL DESPISE US, BY WHICH
I MEAN THEM.
THE TEA PARTY NATION LIKES THIS
NOTION.
THEY SENT AN E-MAIL BLAST
RECOMMENDING WILLIAMS PLAN TO
THEIR MEMBERS CALLING THE A
GREAT IDEA.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
IT IS IN THE SPIRIT OF THE
ORIGINAL BOSTON TEA PARTY WHERE
THE REVOLUTIONARIES DRESSED UP
LIKE INDIANS TO THROW TEA INTO
THE HARBOR TO PROVE INDIANS ARE
TERRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HATE TEA.
I'M READY TO DO THIS THING.
I'M A UNION GOON.
LOOK AT ME I'M A UNION MEMBER.
I'M FROM WISCONSIN OVER HERE
FORGET ABOUT IT.
HEY BADA BING BADA KHAOEDAR
CHEESE.
ACCORD -- CHEDDAR CHEESE.
ACCORDING TO MY ROLEX THAT I
BOUGHT WITH YOUR TAX MONEY IT'S
TIME FOR MY MANDATORY BREAK.
BEING AN EVIL UNION GOON, I'LL
SPEND IT BY FIRING UP MY WOOD
CHIPPER AND I'M GOING TO THROW
IN THIS ADORABLE PUPPY.
"NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT" --
NIGHT, NIGHT BUMBLE BEE.
LOOK FOR THE UNION LABOR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
HE WENT PEACEFULLY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, NOW I WOULD LIKE TO
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FOR ANOTHER
PUPPY BECAUSE MY WOOD CHIPPER IS
STILL HUNGRY.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE WILL
KNOW WHAT THE PROTESTERS ARE
REALLY LIKE.
BY THE WAY, NO ANIMALS WERE
