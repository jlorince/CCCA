SAD.
SAD.
SAD.
(APPLAUSE) FOLKS, MITT ROMNEY HAS BEEN DOGGED ALL WEEK BY HIS HANDLING OF THE LIBYA CRISIS.
BUT YESTERDAY THE ROMNEY PEOPLE SHIFTED GEARS TO CHANGE THE GAME.
>> THERE IS A PUSH BY THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN TO REFOCUS, TO SOMEHOW RESET.
THEY WANT TO REALLY CHANGE THE FOCUS.
>> Stephen: WELL, I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT BY LAST NIGHT NO ONE WAS FOCUSED ON LIBYA ANYMORE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> MITT ROMNEY IS IN DAMAGE CONTROL AFTER A MAGAZINE REVEALED A SECRET VIDEO SHOWING HIM MAKING SOME CONTROVERSIAL
COMMENTS ABOUT AMERICANS.
>> IT'S NOW RAISING TOUGH NEW QUESTIONS FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
>> THIS TAPE HAS SHAKEN THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN TO SAY THE LEAST.
>> Stephen: SHAKEN TO SAY THE LEAST.
VOMITING BLOOD TO SAY THE MOST.
(LAUGHTER) BUT STILL NO LIBYA.
(APPLAUSE) OKAY, THAT'S A VICTORY.
NOW, FOLKS, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
WAY BACK IN MAY MITT SPOKE AT A $50,000 A PLATE FUND-RAISER AT THE BOCA RATON HOME OF PRIVATE EQUITY MANAGEMENT MARC LEDER WHO
IS BEST KNOWN FOR THROWING SOME WILD PARTIES INCLUDING ONE IN THE HAMPTONS LAST SUMMER WHERE GUESTS CAVORTED NUDE IN A POOL
AND PERFORMED SEX ACTS WHILE SCANTILY CLAD RUSSIAN WOMEN DANCED ON PLATFORMS.
I BELIEVE IN RUSSIAN THAT IS CALLED PERE-STROKA.
(LAUGHTER) SO WHAT TERRIBLE THING DID ROMNEY SUPPOSEDLY SAY?
LET'S HEAR IT STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE-OWNER'S MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> 47% OF AMERICANS PAY NO INCOME TAX.
THEREFORE 47% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT NO MATTER WHAT?
ALL RIGHT.
47% WHO ARE WITH HIM WHO ARE DEPENDENT UPON GOVERNMENT, WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE VICTIMS, WHO BELIEVE GOVERNMENT HAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THEM, WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO HEALTH CARE, TO FOOD, TO HOUSING, TO YOU NAME IT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU!
FINALLY A CANDIDATE WITH THE COURAGE TO SAY HALF OF ALL AMERICANS ARE FREELOADERS WHO BELIEVE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO FOOD.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT DO THEY THINK, FOOD GROWS ON TREES?
NO!
(LAUGHTER) WE JOB CREATORS KNOW THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THICK AS A FREE LUNCH!
LUNCH IS $50,000 A PLATE!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS-- IT'S REFRESHING.
IT'S REFRESHING!
FOLKS, THIS IS NOT A CRISIS FOR ROMNEY, THIS IS A TRIUMPH!
BECAUSE MITT NAILED IT!
OBAMA SUPPORTERS ARE NOTHING BUT LAZY PARASITES!
GET A JOB!
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST THE WELFARE QUEENS MITT'S TALKING ABOUT.
GET THIS: THE 47% WHO DON'T PAY FEDERAL INCOME TAX ARE MOSTLY ELDERLY, CHILDREN, AND THE WORKING POOR AND U.S. MILITARY
PERSONNEL DEPLOYED IN WAR ZONES WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM PAYING FEDERAL TAXES ON COMBAT PAY.
SEE?
ROMNEY MENTIONED THE TROOPS IN A SPEECH!
(LAUGHTER) BUT-- BUT OF COURSE-- (APPLAUSE).
GIVE IT UP FOR MITT ROMNEY!
(APPLAUSE) BUT THE LIBERAL HOUNDS, OF COURSE, WENT AFTER MITT LIKE A POOR PERSON GOING AFTER A BASIC NEED.
(LAUGHTER) SO-- (LAUGHTER).
SO ROMNEY THREW TOGETHER HIS SECOND HASTY PRESS CONFERENCE IN ONE WEEK.
I BELIEVE THESE DAYS HE JUST WEARS A HARNESS WITH A CURTAIN AND FLAG MOUNTED TO HIS BACK.
(LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, I AM PROUD TO SAY MITT ROMNEY STOOD HIS GROUND!
>> YOU'RE NOT STEPPING AWAY FROM ANYTHING IN THIS VIDEO?
YOU'RE NOT BACKING AWAY FROM ANYTHING?
AND DO YOU WORRY YOU'VE OFFENDED THIS 47% WHO YOU MENTIOND?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ELEGANTLY STATED, LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY.
I'M SPEAKING OFF THE CUFF.
BUT IT'S A MESSAGE WHICH I'M GOING TO CARRY AND CONTINUE TO CARRY.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, IT'S A MESSAGE THAT HE WANTS TO CARRY.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT CALLING HALF OF AMERICA MINDLESS MOOCHERS WASN'T SAID ELEGANTLY.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, ONCE AGAIN, I WILL FIX THE PROBLEM.
I WILL NOW DELIVER MITT'S CORE MESSAGE FOR THIS TIME WITH A LITTLE MORE PANACHE.
(LAUGHTER) UH-HUH.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) MARIA!
(LAUGHTER) (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES, GUESTS, MADAMES ET MONSIEURS, WAR IS THINK PEOPLE BRINGING US
OUR AMUSE BOUCHE, GREETINGS AND SAL YOU STATIONS.
WHAT A LOVELY EVENING.
I, OF COURSE, WANT TO THANK MARK LEDER FOR HAVING US TO HIS LOVELY HOME.
I HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL LATER IN THE RUSSIAN (BLEEP) PIT.
(LAUGHTER) NOW AS YOU KNOW E-- AS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL GATHERED HERE THIS EVENING BECAUSE I HAVE AGREED TO
ACCEPT THE PRESIDENCY.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY ALMOST HALF-- TWO SCORE AND 7%-- WILL VOTE FOR MY OPPONENT.
THAT SOCIALIST HOTTEN HOT.
BUT WHAT COULD ONE DO?
THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST GREEDY PARASITES SUCKING ON THE WITHERED TEET OF LADY LIBERTY.
OH, HOW THEIR HUNGER KNOWS NO BOUNDS!
WINSLOW, BRING ME SHRIMP AND THE MINDLESS MASSES!
COME ON, COME ON.
YES?
HERE WE GO.
THANK YOU WINSLOW.
THANK YOU.
HOLD STILL.
OKAY.
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.
(LAUGHTER) SEE HOW THEY LOVE IT?
THEY-- THEY OH, IT'S SO SAD.
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR LIVES!
COME ON!
STOP BEING A VICTIM!
OH, WINSLOW, WINSLOW, TAKE THEM AWAY, THEY DEPRESS ME AND THEY SMELL LIKE SHRIMP.
OUT!
OUT!
OH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT DID I SAY?
THEY'LL NEVER VOTE FOR ME.
ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR ALL THE CASH, TO THE (BLEEP) PIT!
I CALL TOPSIES!
WE'LL BE
