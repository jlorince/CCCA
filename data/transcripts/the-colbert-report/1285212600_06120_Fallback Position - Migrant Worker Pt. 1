EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, YOU MAY
REMEMBER THAT BACK IN JULY OF
THIS YEAR, I MET WITH UNITED
FARM WORKERS' PRESIDENT ARTURO
RODRIGUEZ.
HE WAS PROMOTING HIS TAKE OUR
JOBS PLEASE CAMPAIGN.
WHERE ANY AMERICAN WAS OFFERED
ONE OF THE JOBS PRESENTLY HELD
BY IMMIGRANT FARM WORKERS.
JIM?
HOW MANY PEOPLE OF EVERYONE IN
AMERICA HAVE TAKEN YOU UP ON
THIS?
>> ONLY THREE RIGHT NOW ARE
ACTUALLY WORKING IN THE FIELDS.
>> Stephen: THREE PEOPLE.
>> THREE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: MAKE THAT FOUR.
I'LL DO IT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: NOW, OF COURSE,
THE IMMIGRANT JOB I WAS HOPING
FOR WAS MEXICAN WRESTLER.
SO I CAN FINALLY TAKE DOWN AND
AVENGE MYSELF.
BUT ARTURO HAD FARMING ON HIS
MIND, SO I SAID EIEI YES.
AFTER ALL, THESE UNCERTAIN
TIMES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S
AROUND THE CORNER.
I MIGHT LOSE MY PUNDIT JOB.
SO I GRABBED MY OVERALLS AND
SAID, GOOD-BYE, CITY LIFE.
THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FALLBACK POSITION: MIGRANT
WORKER"
♪ HALLELUJAH ♪♪
I HEADED TO GILL FARMS IN
HURLEY, NEW YORK, TO TEST MY
METTLE AS AN IMMIGRANT FARM
WORKER.
FIRST I HEADED TO THE HAY LOFT
WITH THE CHAIR WOMAN OF THE
HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON
IMMIGRATION AND NOTORIOUS
MEXICAN HUGGER.
CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> YOU BET.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU SO
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF
MIGRANT FARM WORKERS?
>> WE WOULDN'T HAVE CROPS THAT
ARE HARVESTED IF THEY WEREN'T
HERE.
WE HAVE TWO SIDES OF THE BORDER.
>> Stephen: TWO SIDES.
>> ONE SAYS NO TRESPASSING, AND
THE OTHER SAYS HELP WANTED.
>> Stephen: JUST TAKE DOWN THE
HELP WANTED SIGN.
PROBLEM SOLVED.
WE COULD GET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
AMERICA BACK TO WORK.
>> THAT'S WHY THIS NEW CAMPAIGN
OF THE FARM WORKERS UNION IS SO
INTERESTING.
"TAKE OUR JOBS PLEASE."
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK
SO FEW AMERICANS HAVE TAKEN UP
THIS CHALLENGE?
>> IT'S TOUGH, DIRTY WORK.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING
AMERICANS AREN'T TOUGH, MADAM?
>> IT'S HOT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING
AMERICANS ARE PUSSIES?
>> I'D NEVER SAY AMERICANS ARE
PUSSIES.
>> Stephen: I THINK YOU JUST
SAID THAT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
LET'S ROLL THE TAPE BACK.
>> ...AMERICANS ARE PUSSIES.
>> Stephen: THERE!
YOU JUST SAID AMERICANS ARE
PUSSIES.
>> 16 AMERICANS HAVE SHOWN UP.
PERHAPS IT WILL BE AN EXAMPLE
AND TWO MILLION AMERICANS WILL
SHOW UP.
>>
>> Stephen: THIS ALL SEEMS
ARCHAIC TO ME.
WE DON'T GET OUR FOOD FROM FARMS
ANYMORE.
WE GET IT FROM THE GROCERY
STORE.
>> AND WE GET OUR WEATHER FROM
THE WEATHER CHANNEL.
>> Stephen: HUH?
>> WHAT?
WE COULD JUST EAT TOTALLY
PROCESSED FOOD.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS
DELICIOUS.
>> WE COULD IMPORT ALL OF OUR
SUGAR AND JUST EAT CANDY.
>> Stephen: LET'S ROTATE CROPS
FOR A SECOND.
HOW HARD IS IT REALLY TO BE A
MIGRANT FARM WORKER?
BECAUSE I LOOK AROUND HERE,
BEAUTIFUL LOCATION, PLENTY OF
FRESH AIR, EXERCISE, ALL THE
INDIVIDUAL TACKLES YOU CAN EAT.
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A FAT CAMP.
>> WELL, YOU GET UP EARLY.
USUALLY YOU START WORK AROUND
5:00 OR 5:30.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S
CHALLENGING.
>> Stephen: LOVE A CHALLENGE.
I DO SUDOKU.
>> YOU'LL FIND YOU'RE SWEATY,
YOU'RE DIRTY, YOUR MUSCLES WILL
ACHE.
>> Stephen: IF I WANT TO BE A
MAY GRANT WORKER, WHAT DO WE DO
FIRST?
SHOULD WE MAKE AN ANCHOR BABY?
>> WHAT?
>>
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THEY
DO HERE.
THEY COME HERE AND THAT STEAL
OUR JOBS AND THEY MAKE ANCHOR
BABIES.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE HEARD "ROLL
IN THE HAY"?
THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENS.
>> NO THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT TERROR
BABIES.
PEOPLE COME HERE AND THEY HAVE
THEIR BABIES, AND THEN THEY TAKE
THE BABY DOWN TO THE GROUND ZERO
MOSQUE AND THE BABY BECOMES A
TERRORIST.
THAT COULD HAPPEN.
>> THAT'S ABSURD.
>> Stephen: THEY SAID IT WAS
AN ABSURD MOVIE AND YET THEY
REMADE IT.
>> THEY DID REMAKE THE MOVIE.
I THOUGHT FIRST ONE WAS BETTER.
>> Stephen: I ALL I'M SAYING
IS LET'S MAKE THAT ANCHOR BABY.
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
>> Stephen: WILL YOU THINK
ABOUT IT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU MIND IF I
THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND?
>> IT'S UP TO YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET MY FARM ON.
BOOM.
DO IT.
AFTER YOU.
PLEASE.
I THINK YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT
IT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: JOIN ME TOMORROW
WHEN I SHOW IMMIGRANTS HOW AN
AMERICAN WORKS THE LAND.
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN,
SANL.
I DON'T NEED THIS PRESSURE.
DO YOU GO TO VEGGIE TALES UP
HERE.
I LOVE JESUS.
YOU MIND NOT CROWDING ME HERE,
