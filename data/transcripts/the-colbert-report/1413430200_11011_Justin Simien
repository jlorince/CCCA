OFFICIALLY SAID KEEP AN EYEON THAT BLACK GUY.
>> IT'S A LITTLE SCARY, MAN,I LIVE IN THE AGE OF TWITTER
SOAR PEOPLE HAVE GOT MYTWITTER HANDLE.
THEY CAN FIGURE OUT EASILYWHERE I LIVE, WHAT MY
MOVEMENTS ARE.
SO I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IT'S NICE, IT'S AN HONORAND IT'S KIND OF SURREAL TO
GET ALL OF THAT IN MY FIRSTFILM.
IT'S CRAZY, I'M GRATEFUL.
>> SO WHY'D YOU MAKE THE FILM?IT'S CALLED DEAR WHITE PEOPLE
IS IT A LOVE LETTER TO WHITEPEOPLE?
>> IT IS CALLED DEAR WHITEPEOPLE BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF
ISN'T A RANT TOWHITE PEOPLE.
IT ACTUALLY FOCUSES ON THESEFOUR BLACK KIDS AT A
MOSTLY WHITE COLLEGE, SORT OFFIGURING OUT THEIR
IDENTITIES.
AND THERE IS A CHARACTER INTHE MOVIE HER NAME IS SAM.
SHE'S GOT A RADIO SHOWCALLED DEAR WHITE PEOPLE.
SHE'S A BIT OF A REBELROUSER AND CALLS PEOPLE OUT
ON THEIR MICROAGGRESSION.
>> Stephen: WHAT'SA MICROAGGRESSION.
>> SORT OF THE FAUX PAUS,LIKE BEING SHOCKED THAT A
BLACK PERSON IS ARTICULATE,YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE,
YOU KNOW, AN AFRO AND YOUFIND WHITE FINGERS IN IT ALL
THE TIME.
>> Stephen: DOES THAT HAPPEN?
>> IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOWTHAT.
ARE THEY HIDING THINGS INTHERE.
WHY ARE THERE FINGERS INTHERE.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RELOOKING FOR, CULTURE MAYBE,
I DIDN'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A CLIPHERE, THE YOUNG LADY IS IN
THE DINING HALL OF THE-- ISIT THE DINING HALL THAT IS
PREDOMINANTLY.
>> PREDOMINANTLY BLACKRESIDENCE HALL AND THERE IS
A CHARACTER NAMED CURT WHOSORT OF HEADS UP A MAGAZINE
ON CAMPUS AND HE DOESN'TREALLY TAKE TOO KINDLY TO
SAM'S SHOW DEAR WHITE PEOPLEAND HE LETS HER KNOW IT.
>> OKAY, TAKE A LOOK.
>> DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, RIGHT?
>> IT'S FUNNY STUFF, HOWHAVE WE NOT-- YOU YET.
>> YOU UNINSPIRED HUMANMAGAZINE.
>> IT IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORETHAN JUST A MAGAZINE,
SWEETHEART.
IT IS BASICALLY HALF LAMPOON,SAME GOES TO THE NETWORK
COMEDIES.
>> AND WHAT GIVES YOUCLUBHOUSE KIDS THE RIGHT TO
COME TO OUR DINING HALL?
>> YOU KNOW,-- LIZ'S HERE.
>> SO HE CAN'T EAT HERE.
>> LET THE MAN EAT.
>> WHO ARE YOU TO THROW MEOUT?
>> WELL, I THINK I'M HEAD OFTHIS HOUSE.
AND I'M DOING THINGS MY WAY.
(APPLAUSE)>> IT'S A POWERFUL SCENE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WHY MAKE A COMEDY ABOUTRACISM?
>> I DON'T THINK RACISM ISFUNNY.
THAT'S WHERE YOU AND IDIFFER.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'TACTUALLY SEE THE MOVIE AS
BEING ABOUT RACISM PER SE.
RACISM SORT OF EXISTS IN THEWORLD OF ANY PERSON OF
COLOR.
>> SO MICROAGGRESSIONS ARENOT THE SAME THING AS
RACISM?
>> IT'S COVERT RACISM, SORTOF RACISM HIDDEN UNDER THE
SURFACE BUT THE MOVIE FOCUSON IDENTITY IT FOCUS ON
THESE KIDS IN A WORLD WHEREMICROAGGRESSIONS AND COVERT
RACISM OCCUR.
AND TALKED ABOUT KIND OF THEDIFFICULTY OF FINDING
YOURSELF IN A PLACE THATDOESN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT
YOU.
>> IS THIS ANAUTOBIOGRAPHICAL STORY, DID
YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A PLACETHAT DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU?
>> AMERICA, GENERALLYSPEAKING, BUT THERE ARE-- .
>> Stephen: AMERICA NUMBERONE, THOUGH, USA NUMBER ONE.
>> IT'S THE BEST, IT'SGREAT.
BUT IT'S JUST WORKING ONSOME THINGS TOO.
BESIDES PUTTING MY HAND INYOUR FRO, IS THERE OTHER
MICROAGGRESSIONS I SHOULDAVOID.
BECAUSE I WANT TO BEFRIENDLY WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
I HAVE MANY BLACK FRIENDS.
>> OKAY.
>> I THINK WE HAVE SOMEPICTURES OF ME WITH SOME OF
MY BLACK FRIENDS OVER THEYEARS.
>> OH, WOW, THAT'S GOOD.
>> YEAH.
>> WOW, YEAH, YOU HAVE MOREBLACK FRIENDS THAN I DO, I
THINK.
SO CONGRATULATIONS.
>> Stephen: OH REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
(APPLAUSE)>> GOOD JOB, MAN.
I THINK IT'S A START.
I THINK IT'S A START.
I THINK PART OF IT IS IT'SNOT MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT
PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT THATYOU HAVE BLACK FRIENDS.
I DON'T THINK IT ABSOLUTELYABSOLVES YOU OF THE TOPIC OF
RACISM OR BEING ABLE TOSTICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND.
>> Stephen: OKAY, WHY HAVE THESEPICTURES OF ME WITH BLACK
PEOPLE IF IT'S NOT TOABSOLVE ME OF RACISM, I
DON'T PUT THESE PICTURES UPHERE FOR MY HEALTH.
>> OH, WOW, OKAY.
>> Stephen: IT'S TO PROVEI'M NOT A RACIST.
>> I THINK WOULD BE NICE TOHAVE FRIENDS JUST BECAUSE
YOU LIKE THEM.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE I LIKETHEM.
I ALSO LIKE THAT I GET TOSHOW THE PICTURES.
>> YEAH.
WE DO LIVE IN THE AGE OF THESELFIE WHERE IT IS NICE TO
SHOW OFF BUT I DON'T THINK APERSON NECESSARILY WANTS TO
BE A PROP IN YOUR LIFE WITH ALLDUE RESPECT.
I THINK PEOPLE SORT OF WANTTO BE YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE
YOU GENUINELY LIKE THEM.
>> Stephen: SNOOP SEEMSHAPPY.
>> YEAH, HE DOES.
>> Stephen: NOW THESEASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT
PEOPLE BASED UPON THEIRAPPEARANCE, ARE THEY
NECESSARILY RACIAL OR IS ITA MICROAGGRESSION FOR ME TO
LOOK AT THE TWEED AND THEPLAID AND GO THAT GUY SAY
NERD.
>> THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BEACCURATE.
>> Stephen: IT WOULD BE?
THAT IS NOT AMICROAGGRESSION. IT IS A
MICROIDENTIFICATION.
>> I'M A HUGE NERD.
>> Stephen: YOUSELF-IDENTIFY AS NERD.
>> I DO AND EVERYTHING THATCOMES WITH THAT.
>> Stephen: I THINK YOU ALSOIDENTIFY AS GAY.
>> IT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANYCHANCE YOU MIGHT GENTRIFYING
YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR OWNNEIGHBORHOOD?
>> IT'S A CHANCE.
>> Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITHTHAT.
>> IT'S A CHANCE.
THANKS, MAN.
>> Stephen: JUSTIN SIMIEN, THEMOVIE IS DEAR WHITE PEOPLE.
OPENS OCTOBER 17th THISFRIDAY.
