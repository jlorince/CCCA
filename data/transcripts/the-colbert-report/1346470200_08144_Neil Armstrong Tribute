>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, AMERICA LOST AN ICON LAST WEEK.
THE FIRST MAN TO WALK ON THE MOON, NEIL ARMSTRONG.
AND REMEMBRANCES HAVE BEEN POURING IN LIKE MONEY POURING OUT OF NASA'S BUDGET.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HE WAS AN AMERICAN HERO AND A SPACE PIONEER.
>> ARMSTRONG REWROTE HISTORY.
>> HE WAS THE EPITOME OF COOL UNDER PRESSURE.
>> A MAN WHO MADE HIS COUNTRY BELIEVE THAT WITH ENOUGH KNOW HOW WE COULD DO ANYTHING.
>> I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUTOUT TO ASTRONAUT NEIL ARMSTRONG.
THANK YOU FOR LETTING US ALL DREAM OF GOING WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YES, YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON GERALDO RIVERA TO FIND JUST THE RIGHT WORDS
FROM-- THE STAR TREK OPENING CREDITS.
WELL, NATION-- I WOULD LIKE TO AD MY VOICE TO THESE TRIBUTES AND SAY, NEIL
ARMSTRONG, I DON'T KNOW.
NO, NO, HEAR ME OUT.
I KNOW I'M TO THE GOING TO WIN ANY SPACE MEDALS FOR THIS BUT MAY I REMIND YOU
WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE FIRST SET FOOT ON THE MOON.
>> THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.
>> MANKIND?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA KIND, NEIL.
I'M SORRY, DID YOU PLANT THE FLAG OF MANKIND?
DID MANKIND SPEND MILLIONS OF COLORS AND THOUSANDS OF MAN HOURS DEVELOPING YOU A
REFRESHING ORANGE SPACE DRINK?
LOOK, I CAN UNDERSTAND GETTING ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT AND HAVING A SLIP OF
THE TONGUE BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE YOU BROUGHT A PLAQUE IT UP THERE WHICH READS WE CAME
IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND.
COME ON!
THE SPACE RACE WAS A PROXY WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.
THAT PLAQUE SHOULD HAVE READ,
SUCK IT IVAN SINCERELY JFK'S GHOST.
COME ON!
BUT WHAT OFFENDS ME MOST ABOUT ARMSTRONG IS THAT HE WAS THE FIRST MAN ON THE MOON AND NEVER HAD THE
DECENCY TO WALLOW IN HIS FAME.
>> YOU SOME TIMES SEEM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH YOUR CELEBRITY, THAT YOU WOULD
RATHER NOT HAVE ALL OF THIS ATTENTION.
>> NO I JUST DON'T DESERVE IT.
>> THIS IS HOW LITTLE THIS GUY UNDERSTANDS AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER) CELEBRITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DESERVING ANYTHING.
(LAUGHTER) COME ON!
600 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED HIM LAND ON THE MOON THAT IS THE ULTIMATE REALITY SHOW.
HE GOT VOTED OFF THE PLANET.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT A TRAGEDY THAT THE GREATEST ADVENTURER IN HISTORY NEVER HAD THE BALLS TO CASH IN.
I MEAN HE COULD HAVE APPEARED WITH SCOOBY AND THE GANG IN TERROR AT TRANQUILLITY BASE OR ENDORSE
NEIL ARMSTRONG'S MOON PIES.
THAT'S ONE SMALL SNACK FOR MAN, ONE GIANT TREAT FOR MANKIND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
