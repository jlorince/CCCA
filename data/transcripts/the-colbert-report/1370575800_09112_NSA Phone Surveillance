( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
( CHEERS )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT, FOLKS.
ENORMOUS NEWS COMING OUT OF
WASHINGTON, D.C.--
( CHEERS )
PLEASE, NATION.
WE GOTTA DO IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, FOLKS.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE SHOCKING
NEWS OUT OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION THAT AFFECTS ANY
AMERICAN WHO MAKES PHONE CALLS.
( LAUGHTER )
SO ANYONE OVER 25.
FOR MORE, WE WATCH A SCREEN.
>> THE N.S.A. HAS BEEN SECRETLY
SPYING ON EVERYDAY AMERICANS FOR
MONTHS.
A NEW REPORT SAYS THE N.S.A. IS
COLLECTING PHONE RECORDS FROM
MILLIONS OF VERIZON WIRELESS
CUSTOMERS.
>> THE ORDER WAS ISSUED BY THE
SECRET SURVEILLANCE COURT AND
GRANTED THE GOVERNMENT UNLIMITED
AUTHORITY TO COLLECT DATA.
>> Stephen:  YES, THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY IS SPYING ON OUR
PHONE CALLS, AND UNLIKE DURING
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THIS
TIME IT'S THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
THIS GUY, HE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO
OUTDO HIS PREDECESSOR.
OH, HE POURED WATER ON THEIR
FACE?
I'M GOING TO BLOW 'EM UP.
DID I WIN?
THAT'S HOW HE TALKS, BY THE WAY.
THAT'S MY OBAMA IMPRESSION.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, ACCORDING TO THE U.K.'S
"GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER, VERIZON'S
BUSINESS SERVICES DIVISION WAS
ORDERED BY THE F.B.I. TO DELIVER
MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS'
TELE-PHONY METADATA.
METADATA MEANS INFORMATION ABOUT
A CALL'S LENGTHS, LOCATION, AND
PARTICIPANTS.
TELE-PHONY IS WHAT A
TWO-YEAR-OLD CALLS A TELEPHONE.
( APPLAUSE )
AND BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE ME,
OBAMA KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE CALLS
BETWEEN BETSY AND PUPPY WUPPY.
NOW, FOLKS I'M GOING TO BE
STRAIGHT WITH YOU.
I'M CONFLICTED HERE, FOLKS.
ON THE ONE HAND THIS PROVES
OBAMA IS A TYRANNICAL DESPOT WHO
IGNORES ALL THE RULES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I KIND OF
LIKE TYRANNICAL DESPOTS WHO
BREAK ALL THE RULES.
SHOWS SPUNK.
AND JUST A CHERRY ON TOP OF MY
CONFLICT SUNDAE, I'M NO FAN OF
THE "NEW YORK TIMES," BUT THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" IS NO FAN OF
OBAMA DOING THIS, SAYING IN
TODAY'S OP-ED, "THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW LOST ALL
CREDIBILITY."
YES, I'D LIKE TO ORDER HOME
DELIVERY OF THE "NEW YORK
TIMES," PLEASE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
MY WIFE LIKES THE "STYLE"
SECTION.
I GO STRAIGHT FOR THE OBAMA
BASHING.
BUT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A
PHONE CALL JUST THEN.
I JUST ASSUMED WANT N.S.A. IS
LISTENING AND WILL PASS IT ON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THEN AGAIN, I DO THINK THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION HAS A POINT.
WHEN THEY CALL THIS PROGRAM "A
CRITICAL TOOL IN PROTECTING THE
NATION FROM TERRORIST THREATS TO
THE UNITED STATES," AND NOT JUST
BECAUSE ANYONE WHO HAS DEALT
WITH VERIZON'S CUSTOMER SERVICE
WANTS TO KILL SOMEONE.
NOW, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR
LINDSAY GRAHAM MAKES A GREAT
POINT.
>> I'M A VERIZON CUSTOMER.
I DON'T MIND VERIZON TURNING
OVER RECORDS TO THE THE
GOVERNMENT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS
GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY TRY TO
MATCH UP A KNOWN TERRORIST
PHONING WITH SOMEBODY IN THE
UNITED STATES.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TALKING
WITH TERRORISTS.
I KNOW I'M NOT, SO WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
>> Stephen:  YES, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, PEOPLE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT
ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT.
THAT'S WHY I AM CALLING ON
SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM TO STOP
WEARING PANTS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
SO WE CAN FINALLY, FINALLY LAY
TO REST THE DISTURBING AND I AM
SURE UNFOUND RUMORS THAT HE IS A
MIDDLE AGED LESBIAN.
BUT I DON'T FOR A MINUTE BELIEVE
THAT'S TRUE.
BUT THERE IS ONE PARTY WHOSE
PRIVACY HAS BEEN VIOLATED HERE.
IT'S VERIZON'S.
WE, THE PUBLIC, HAVE NO RIGHT TO
KNOW THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION
THAT THEY TURNED OVER OUR
PRIVATE INFORMATION.
( LAUGHTER )
THIS WILL LOSE VERIZON MILLIONS
OF CUSTOMERS, OR IT WOULD
