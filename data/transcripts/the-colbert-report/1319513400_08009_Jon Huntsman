(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE AND FORMER
AMBASSADOR TO CHINA.
I'LL ASK HIM IF THE
ARTIFICIALLY DEPRESSED
CURRENCY AFFECTS OUR TRADE
DEFICIT-- DEFICIT IN BED.
PLEASE WELCOME JON HUNTSMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
HEY, GOVERNOR, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR COMING ON.
SIR, WHAT A PLEASURE.
I LOVE HAVING THE CANDIDATES
ON TO HASH OUT THE ISSUES.
>> THE HONOR IS MINE, THANK
YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: I KNOW.
NOW I SHOULD JUST WARN YOU I
HAVE A SUPERPAC SO LEGALLY
WE CANNOT COORDINATE OUR,
YOUR CAMPAIGN WITH MY
SUPERPAC'S MONEY SO DON'T
SAY ANYTHING THAT YOU MEAN.
YOU WERE OBAMA'S AMBASSADOR
TO CHINA LEGALLY I HAVE TO
DO THAT.
HOW CAN I TRUST YOU.
YOU WORK FOR O BOMBA.
>> LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
I WAS RAISED WITH THE BELIEF
IN MY FAMILY THAT YOU ALWAYS
PUT COUNTRY FIRST.
THAT WHEN YOUR PRESIDENT
ASKS YOU TO STAND UP AND
SERVE, PARTICULARLY DURING A
TIME OF AND ECONOMIC
HARDSHIP, YOU DO AS TOLD.
>> Stephen: ARE WE AT WAR
WITH CHINA
(LAUGHTER)
>> BASED ON THIS INTERVIEW
WE COULD END UP THERE AND I
HOPE WE DON'T.
BUT--
(APPLAUSE)
BUT LISTEN, I'M ONE WHO
BELIEFS IN PUTTING COUNTRY
FIRST.
I KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN
MEMBERS OF MY OWN POLITICAL
PARTY WHO WILL SAY THAT
HUNTSMAN GUY, NO HOW, NO WAY,
NO WAY COULD I EVER VOTE FOR
HIM BECAUSE HE WORKED FOR A
DEMOCRAT.
AND I SAY GEE, I WORKED FOR
A LOT OF PRESIDENTS,
PRESIDENT REAGAN, PRESIDENT
BUSH, PRESIDENT BUSH, YOU
PUT COUNTRY FIRST.
AND I WILL TAKE THAT
PHILOSOPHY TO MY GRAVE.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
ALL AMERICANS TO BELIEVE IN
COUNTRY FIRST.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THAT IS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YEAH THAT IS
PRAISE WORTHY THAT IDEA.
BUT I THINK THAT THE DANGER
IS, IS THAT IT HAS GARNERED
YOU SOME, A LABEL THAT IF
YOU DON'T MIND ME USING
THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE THIS
SOUND NICE, YOU'RE A
MODERATE.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW CAN YOU BE A MODERATE IN
TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY?
ARE YOU EXTREME ABOUT
ANYTHING.
SAY SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
TO ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE
RIGHT NOW!
>> HERE'S THE DEAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I RAN FOR RE-ELECTION AS
GOVERNOR.
IN 2008.
I WON REPUBLICANS, I WON
INDEPENDENTS, I WON A WHOLE
LOT OF DEMOCRATS, MORE THAN
MY DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT THAT
IS NOT CARRYING A LABEL,
THAT IS BEING A LEADER.
YOU TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO AND DELIVER
FOR THE CITIZENS, THEY JUST
WANT STRAIGHT TALK.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT RUN AS A
DEMOCRAT.
IF YOU GOT MORE DEMOCRATIC
VOTES SHOULDN'T YOU RUN AS A
DEMOCRAT.
>> I THINK THAT IS RARE IN
THE STATE OF UTAH SO I LIKE
TO FLY THAT FLAG.
>> Stephen: NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT, A LOT OF UGLY TALK IN
THE CAMPAIGN LATELY, ABOUT
THE FAITH THAT YOU AND MITT
ROMNEY SHARE.
OKAY, MORMONISM.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF PEOPLE
CALLING MORMONISM A CULT.
AND BY THE WAY I'M A
CATHOLIC.
YOU'RE A MORMON.
LET'S NOT ARGUE OVER WHO'S
RIGHT AND WHO IS NOT A
CATHOLIC.
BUT--
(LAUGHTER)
LET JESUS DECIDE, THE LAST
JUDGEMENT.
WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE FEEL
LIKE IT'S OKAY TO ATTACK
MORMONS?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU
GET INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE
TALKING ABOUT RELIGION SO
YOU SHOULD NEVER GO THERE
PARTICULARLY WHEN ARE YOU
SEEKING VOTES AND RUBBING
FOR PUBLIC OFFICE BUT WHEN
JOHN F. KENNEDY RAN IN 1960,
WHAT WERE PEOPLE CALLING
CATHOLICISM, A CULT.
SO THEY COME OUT, THEY
BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM,
PEOPLE FIND OUT ABOUT THEM,
JOHN F. KENNEDY WINS.
RELIGION GOES MAINSTREAM.
PROBABLY THE SAME WITH
MORMONISM THERE SOMEBODY AN
IMPORTANT TIME UBS FOR US
ALL TO PULL TOGETHER AS
AMERICANS, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
>> YOU KNOW, IT IS UNNARL
AND UNHEALTHY FOR THE MOST
BLUE SKY OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD.
WE AS AMERICANS TO BE AS
DIVIDED AS WE ARE TODAY.
>> Stephen: DON'T WE HAVE TO
TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.
>> WE HAVE TO FIX IT.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE
IT BACK FIRST BEFORE WE CAN
FIX IT.
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THOSE
CHANTS.
TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.
>> WE HAVE TO FIX IT I LIVED
IN CHINA.
>> Stephen: I HEARD.
>> WE COVERED THAT EARLIER.
AND HERE'S THE DEAL-- .
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY.
BUT LEGALLY WE HAVE TO DO
THAT.
BY THE WAY, I FIND AS I, AS
YOU HAVE SEEN, I'M SCARED OF
CHINESE PEOPLE AND NOT
CHINESE AMERICANS, GREATEST
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BUT
CHINESE PEOPLE.
YOU SPEAK MANDARIN.
DO YOU NOT.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SAY THE MOST NONSCARY THING
IN-- IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WOULD YOU SAY THE MOST
NONSCARY NICEST THING IN
MANDARIN PLEASE.
>> (SPEAKING MANDARIN).
>> Stephen: TERRIFYING.
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY, WHAT
DID YOU JUST SAY.
>> I JUST SAID I THINK THAT
YOU OUGHT TO CONSIDER BEING
MY RUNNING MATE FOR VICE
PRESIDENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I THINK THAT
MIGHT BE, THAT MIGHT BE
CONSIDERED COORDINATION.
>> WHERE IS THAT CODE OF
SILENCE WHEN YOU NEED.
>> Stephen: I'M PART OF THE
1%.
YOU'RE PART OF THE 1%.
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: I READ YOUR
BIOSOMEONE HAS A CHEMICAL
COMPANY.
AND IT'S NOT MY.
WHAT CAN WE DO AS MEMBERS OF
THE 1% WHAT CAN WE DO TO
BUILD, THERE'S A WEALTH GAP
IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD CANTOR'S
SPEECH THAT HE DIDN'T GIVE
ABOUT IT.
IT WAS FANTASTIC.
A WEALTH GAB IN THE-- GAP IN
THIS UNITED STATES OF 1
PERCENTERS OR 1/10 OF 1%ERS
AND THE 99%, CAN WE BUILD A
BRIDGE TO THEM?
THAT THEN WE CAN DRAW UP AT
NIGHT?
HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE, HOW
DO WE COMMUNICATE TO THE
LOWER 99% TO NOT BE MAD AT
US 1%ERS.
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE
DRAWBRIDGE, STEVEN-- STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: IT'S A HANDY
THING.
>> WE CAN BUILD A LEVEL
PLAYING-- PLAYING FIELD.
WE NEED A LEVEL PLAYING
FIELD FOR EDUCATION, WE NEED
EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF YOUR
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED.
>> Stephen: RECENT POLLS YOU
WERE AT 2%, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE COLBERT BUMP.
>> I AM SO READY FOR THE
COLBERT BUMP.
>> Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO
GET YOU, GOVERNOR, YOU MAY
BE AT 2%, WE'RE GOING TO GET
YOU UP TO WHOLE MILK, ALL
RIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
