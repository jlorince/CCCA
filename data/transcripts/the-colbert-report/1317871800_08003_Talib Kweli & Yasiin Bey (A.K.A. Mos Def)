>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE
UNDERGROUND HIP-HOP PIONEERS.
I'LL ASK THEM TO CLARIFY IF
THEY'RE MORE HIP-HOP OR RIP-RAP.
PLEASE WELCOME BLACK STAR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS SO MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
ALL RIGHT.
TALIB, MOS, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
YOU WERE HERE THIS SUMMER.
>> I GAVE YOU HAT.
YOU GOT THE SWAG.
>> Stephen: I GOT SWAG AND YOU
GAVE ME SOME SWAGGER.
WE HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE.
MANY OF MY AUDIENCE MEMBERS MAY
BE LOOKING AT YOU AND THINKING,
HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE MOS DEF,
BUT YOU ARE NO LONGER MOS DEF,
CORRECT?
>> NOPE, I'M IN THE USING MOS
DEF AS A PROFESSIONAL NAME
ANYMORE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE?
>> YASSIN BAY.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU NOT
BE MOS DEF ANYMORE?
HE'S A FAMOUS GUY WHO SELLS
RECORDS.
WHY NOT DO THAT?
>> WELL, I... IT'S A NON DE
PLUME SIMILAR TO WHAT MARK TWAIN
WAS.
>> Stephen: ONE OF AMERICA'S
GREAT ET CETERA HIP-HOP ARTISTS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IN HIS DAY.
>> A GREAT INSPIRATION.
>> Stephen: THOUGH I WAS
OFFENDED BY THE WAY HE DROPPED
THE "N" WORD IN "HUCKLEBERRY
FINN."
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
OKAY.
SO YOU'RE NOT... YOU GUYS,
YOU'RE CONSIDERED LIKE
UNDERGROUND RAP, LIKE PIONEERS
OF UNDERGROUND RAP.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THAT AND CORPORATE RAP BECAUSE I
LOVE CORPORATE THINGS.
>> WELL, UNDERGROUND RAP, IT'S A
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- LABEL
THAT WE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN, THAT WE DON'T
RHYME ABOVE SEA LEVEL?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF
DIVERSITY IN HIP-HOP.
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT
STYLES AND, YOU KNOW, ACROSS ALL
DIFFERENT GENRES OF ART.
SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO LIKE
THE LABEL THINGS I GUESS BECAUSE
IT'S... STEPHEN, IT ALLOWS ME TO
PIGEONHOLE YOU.
>> EXACTLY, WHICH IS FAVORITE
PASTIME FOR SOME PEOPLE.
WE JUST DO WHAT WE DO.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO... I
GUESS THIS IS A REBELLIOUS
THING.
YOU DON'T HAVE A CONCERN RAT
SPONSOR FOR YOUR MUSIC RIGHT
NOW, DO YOU?
>> THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT US
BEING ABLE TO DO THIS SHOW IS
THAT BOTH ME AND YASSIN ARE IN
CREATIVE SPACES AND IN
PROFESSIONAL SPACE, BUT WE ARE
NOT ALIGNED WITH ANY PARTICULAR
RECORD COMPANY SOME WHEN WE
PERFORM MUSIC OR WHEN YOU GET
MUSIC FROM US AT THIS POINT, YOU
ARE GETTING IT DIRECTLY FROM US.
THERE'S IN MIDDLE MAN.
IT'S STRAIGHT INDEPENDENT.
>> Stephen: I'M THE MIDDLE
MAN.
I'M THE MIDDLE MAN.
I'M KIND OF THE LABEL FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE MINUTES.
I HOPE I HEAR A SINGLE WHAT I'M
HEARING.
I HOPE I HEAR A SINGLE.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE
LOOK.
I'M THINKING MOP TOPS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND WE ADD A GIRL.
>> MAYBE.
WE GOT A GIRL.
>> WE CAN DO ELVIS PRESLEY IN
THE GHETTO.
♪♪
>> Stephen: AM I IN?
>> YOU'RE ON THE TEAM.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU GUYS
COLLABORATE.
A LOT OF HIP-HOP PEOPLE
COLLABORATE TOGETHER.
OKAY.
BUT IN ANY COLLABORATION, LIKE
IN ANY PARTNERSHIP, THERE'S ONE
GUY THAT'S DOING THE WORK AND,
YOU KNOW, ONE GUY IS THERE FOR
THE RIDE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
SO YOU'RE DOING THE WORK?
>> THAT'S ME.
>> Stephen: AND HE'S THE ONE
WHO LOOKS PRETTY AND HITS THE
TAMBOURINE?
>> MORE COW BELL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A GREAT
ACT COMING UP CALLED "BLACK
STAR."
WOULD YOU GUYS STICK AROUND AND
WITH -- BE THEM.
>> BEFORE THE SHOW, THIS IS OUR
CLASSY WARRIOR PACKAGE FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: CLASSY WARRIOR?
>> JUST IN THE EVENT THAT YOU
GET, YOU KNOW, SUMMONED TO THAT
CHENEY HUNTING INVITATIONAL.
>> Stephen: I MIGHT GET INVITE
TODRICK PERRY'S HUNTING
INVITATIONAL.
YOU GUYS SHOULD HEAD DOWN THERE,
TOO.
>> OR GOLF SUMMIT.
HERE'S A CLASSY WARRIOR TIE FOR
YOU.
>> Stephen: CLASSY WARRIOR.
>> BECAUSE IF IT'S A CLASS WAR,
YOU SHOULD BE A CLASSY WARRIOR.
>> Stephen: OH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, GUYS, ARE YOU READY FOR
THE COLBERT BUMP?
>> I CAME HERE FOR THE COLBERT
BUMP.
