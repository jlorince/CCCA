FOLKS-- THANK YOU.
FOLKS, IT IS CLEAR WHO IS TO
BLAME FOR TAKING SARAH AWAY
FROM US.
HER SO-CALLED SUPPORTERS.
YOU DID NOT GIVE HER ENOUGH
MONEY.
SHE GAVE YOU PLENTY OF
CHANCES.
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
SARAHPAC WAS SENDING
SUPPORTERS A DESPERATE CRY
TO HELP HER.
QUOTE, SOMEONE MUST SAVE OUR
NATION FROM THIS ROGUE TO
EUROPEAN SOCIALISM, DO YOU
THINK IT SHOULD BE GOVERNOR
PALIN?
IF SO, YOU CAN SEND YOUR
BEST ONE TIME GIFT TO
SARAHPAC TODAY, TO SHOW HER
WE SUPPORT HER IF SHE
DECIDES TO RUN.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU CLEARLY DID NOT CLAP
ENOUGH MONEY AT HER AND NOW
GOVERNOR TINKER BELL IS
DEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS-- ALL SHE'S GOT LEFT
LEFT-- THANK YOU.
ALL SHE'S GOT LEFT IN
SARAHPAC IS $1.4 MILLION.
HOW WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED TO
DO WITH THAT NOW.
SPEBDZ IT ON HERSELF?
SHE CAN?
WELL THEN SHE SHOULD.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE DESERVES IT.
MAYBE A LITTLE RETAIL
THERAPY.
BUY HERSELF A NICE DRESS, OR
PERH
