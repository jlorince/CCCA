BEFORE I TURNED MY LIFE IN THIS
MUSIC.

FROM THE GANG LIFE -- MAY I CALL
THE A THUG LIFE?
>> CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE I
KNOW THEçyó GNOME CALCULATE TOUR OF
THIS.
>> PEOPLE DON'T GET OUT OF THAT?
>> RAP MUSIC CAME ALONG AND IT
WAS ANOTHER WAY FOR ME TO
EXPRESS MYSELF.
I STARTED TO MAKE MUSIC ABOUT
THE LIFESTYLE AND WITHOUT
KNOWING IT I CREATED A NEW STYLE
OF RAP CALLED GANGSTA RAP

CALLED BODY COUNT AND COP
KILLER.
IS IT HARD FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF
TRAFFIC TICKETS?

>> TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE
TUNNEL RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

SEATBELT.

SEATBELT KILLING COPS.
IT'S SIMILAR.
YOU PLAY A COP NOW.
>> YES, I PLAYED A COP IN MY
FIRST MOVIE "NEW JACK CITY. ".
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE BAD
FEELINGS ABOUT COPS WHEN YOU
WERE YOUNGER?
>> I NEVER DISLIKED COPS.
WHEN I WAS BREAKING THE LAW THE
COPS WERE THE OPPONENT.
I THOUGHT I COULD OUTSMART THEM.
YOU DON'T DISLIKE THE COPS YOU
ARE TRYING TO BEAT THEM.
YOU ARE TRYING TO BREAK THE LAW.
THEY ARE TRYING TO UPHOLD THE
LAW.
I DON'T BREAK THE LAW ANYMORE.
>> Stephen: WHAT WERE SOME OF
THE LAWS YOU BROKE.
>> EVERY POSSIBLE ONE.
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE OUT TO
DO, IT'S AN OCCUPATION.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU A THIEF?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: DOES YOU BOTHER
YOU NOW THAT PEOPLE STEAL YOUR
MUSIC?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT'S JUST A GAME.
>> IT'S PAYBACK.
YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME IT SEEMED
LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
NOW YOU TURN AROUND --
>> Stephen: DID IT REALLY SEEM
LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO OR
JUST SOMETHING TO DO?
[LAUGHTER]
>> IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE AT
THE MOMENT IT SEEMED LIKE THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
WHEN YOU GET OLDER YOU LOOK BACK
AND YOU ARE LIKE WOW I WAS
TAKING A LOT OF RISKS.
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO
KIDS THAT ARE GOING DOWN THAT
ROAD.
THE FIRST HALF OF MY BOOK IS
THAT ROAD.
THE SECOND HALF IS HOW I MADE
THE DETOUR.
>> Stephen: DID YOU DO DRUGS?
>> NEVER DID DRUGS.
>> Stephen: NEVER DID DRUGS?
>> I DON'T DRINK.
>> Stephen: DID YOU EVER
DRINK?
>> I WAS SCARED.
I'M AN ORPHAN.
IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK.
I START OFF -- MY MOTHER PASSED
WHEN I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE,
FATHER IN THE SEVENTH.
I WAS ON MY OWN MY WHOLE LIFE.
I LIVED WITH MY AUNT UNTIL I WAS
17.
I WAS ON MY OWN.
I FELT DRUGS OR ALCOHOL
COMPROMISED MY POSITION.
I HAD TO PROTECT MYSELF.
>> Stephen: YOU DID DIDN'T DO
DRUGS BUT YOU HAVE PLENTY OF
STREET KRED.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I COULD SCORE
SOME PURE UNCUT CRED.
>> YOU GOT THE CRED.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.
