AND, FOLKS, I'M SORRY ABOUT
THAT.
I GUESS THE REASON I TAKE THIS
SO PERSONALLY IS THAT I AM SO
MUCH LIKE SUPERMAN.
IN THEIR DARKEST HOUR...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
SOMEONE HAD TO SAY IT.
AND ONCE AGAIN IT HAD TO BE ME.
LIKE SUPERMAN, IN THEIR DARKEST
HOUR, I ALWAYS AM THERE TO
DEFEND THE UNDERDOG.
LIKE EXXON.
OR GOLDMAN SACHS AND UNDERDOG
INDUSTRIES.
HOW COULD UNDERDOG HAVE KNOWN
THAT GIVING DOGS A CHEMICAL
UNDERCOAT WOULD SEAL THEIR POURS
AND CAUSE CANINE DEMENTIA?
BOTTOM LINE: DID THOSE DOGS RUST
OR NOT?
THEY DIDN'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH.
WELL NOW, ANOTHER DEFENSELESS
MULTINATIONAL IS BEING UNFAIRLY
ATTACKED BECAUSE OF A LITTLE
SLIP-UP.
>> FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE
SCRAMBLING TO FIND OUT PPECISELY
HOW GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT
CREATED BY BIOTECH GIANT MAN
SANDT OWE ENDED UP IN AN OREGON
WHEAT FARM.
>> THE WHEAT WAS TESTED AFFER IT
WAS SPRAYED REPEATEDLY BUT IT
WOULD NOT DIE.
GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT WAS
CREATED BY MONSANTO A DECADE AGO
BUT NEVER APPROVED FOR
COMMERCIAL USE.
>> THE WHEAT WAS GENETICALLY
MODIFIED, THE SAME STRAIN TESTED
BUT THEN ABANDONED BY MONSANTO
FROM 1998 TO 2005
>> Stephen: A FARMER FOUND
GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT IN
HIS FIELD THAT MONSANTO STOPPED
GROWING BACK IN 2005 WHICH MEANS
THIS WHEAT IS NOT ONLY
REPRODUCING ON ITS OWN BUT
SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TELL
IT THAT MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE
WAS CANCELED.
THE WHEAT WAS CREATED TO BE ONE
OF MONSANTO'S ROUND-UP READY
CROPS WHICH AREEGENETICALLY
ENGINEERED TO WITHSTAND
BOMBARDMENT BY MONSANTO'S
ROUND-UP, A POWERFUL HERBICIDE
THAT KILLS EVERY LIVING PLANT
EXCEPT THE CROP.
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE WHEAT
CAME FROM SINCE MONSANTO SWEARS
IT DESTROYED ALL TESTED MATERIAL
AFTER ABANDONING THE PROGRAM.
AND THEN JUST TO MAKE SURE NO
ONE EVER  OUND THE REMAINS, THEY
BURIED THAT WHEAT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIELD.
BUT NOW, FOLKS, NOW THE WHEAT IS
BACK AND THE COMPANY HAS A
PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION.
MONSANTO SAYS IT IS MYSSIFIED BY
THE APPEARANCE OF THE WHEAT.
OKAY.
THEY DON'T KNOW SO MAYBE WE
SHOULD ASK THE GENETICALLY
MODIFIED WHEAT.
AT THIS POINT, IT CAN PROBABLY
TALK.
LONG STORY SHORT.
THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL
BUT TRY TEELING THAT TO THE
SKITTISH FOREIGNERS.
>> JAPAN IMMEDIATELY POSTPONED A
25,000-TON ORDER FROM A PORTLAND
GRAIN SHIPPER.
IT'S PUT IN JEOPARDY THIS YEAR'S
ORE GONE CROP WHICH IS VALUED
BETWEEN $500 AND $500 MILLION.
>> Stephen: REALLY, JAPAN?
YOU'RE AFRAID OF A LITTLE
GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT?
MAY I REMIND YOU, YOU EAT RAW
OCTOPUS  AINT.
NOW, SURE, OREGON WHEAT FARMERS
ARE HURTING BUT WE ALL KNOW
MONSANTO IS THE REAL VICTIM
HERE.
THEY COULD FACE CRIMINAL
PROSECUTION AND BE FINED UP TO A
MILLION DOLLARS.
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
MONSANTO TO EARN A MILLION...
OH, THEY JUST DID.
THAT WAS FAST.
