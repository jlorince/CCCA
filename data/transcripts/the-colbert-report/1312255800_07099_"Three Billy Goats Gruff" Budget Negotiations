[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OH, BOY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK
YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
I WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT
OUT HERE, OUT THERE TO ALL MY
BRONIES WHO MAY BE WATCHING.
[LAUGHTER]
DON'T RIDE THE WHITE BRONY.
AFTER LAUGH IT'S --
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, IT IS EXACTLY 11:32
EASTERN TIME, IF I HAD NOT
PRE-TAPED THIS SHOW FOUR HOURS
AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER CONGRESS
HAS PASSED THE COMPROMISE PLAN
TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING.
OR WHETHER WE DEFAULTED AND YOU
ARE WATCHING THIS FROM A CAVE,
EATING SQUIRRELS THAT YOU ARE
COOKING OVER A PILE OF U.S.
TREASURY BONDS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I'M BETTING DEFAULT WHICH
IS WHY I SPENT THE WEEKEND
BOTTLING MY OWN URINE TO USE AS
DRINKING WATER.
REMEMBER, YOU WANT TO RUN IT
THROUGH THE BRITA THREE TIMES.
[LAUGHTER]
AFTER THAT, YOU ARE GOLDEN, OR
RATHER YOU ARE NOT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IF THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS
AND CONGRESS COOPERATES, THERE'S
A SILVER LINING TO SOLVENCY
BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST KIND OF
DEAL-- THE KIND DEMOCRATS HATE.
>> NOW IS THIS THE DEAL I WOULD
HAVE PREFERRED, NO?
>> WE ALL MAY NOT BE TO BE ABLE
TO SUPPORTED IT OR NONE OF US
MAY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT.
>> THIS IS NOT A BALANCED
APPROACH.
>> THIS IS A SATAN SANDWICH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YES, FOR THE
DEMOCRATS THIS IS A SATAN
SANDWICH, A BEELZE-B-L-T, A
BECAUSE THE DEAL GIVES THE
REPUBLICANS $2.4 TRILLION IN
CUTS WITH NO INCREASE IN TAXES
OR CLOSING LOOPHOLES FOR
CORPORATIONS AND THE RICH.
IN RETURN, THE DEMOCRATS GET A
RISE IN THE DEBT CEILING THAT
LASTS UNTIL 2013.
YOU KNOW YOU'VE WON A
NEGOTIATION WHEN THE OPPONENT'S
ONLY DEMAND IS NOT TO HAVE TO
NEGOTIATE WITH YOU AGAIN FOR A
LONG TIME.
WLAF LAUGH --
[LAUGHTER]
AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN
BOEHNER SAID, THE REPUBLICANS
GOT 98% OF WHAT THEY WANTED.
SO OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS ARE
THRILLED.
>> FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
POINT OF VIEW WE CAN DECLARE
VICTORY.
I'M NOT READY TO VOTE FOR THIS.
>> THIS SAY VICTORY FOR OUR
LEADERSHIP.
I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS.
>> THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I AM
INCLINED TO SUPPORT.
>> I'M NOT INCLINED TO SUPPORT
IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YES.
THIS IS A VICTORY BUT IT COULD
HAVE BEEN SO MUCH VICTORY-ER!
WHAT ABOUT A BALANCED BUDGET
AMENDMENT?
WHAT ABOUT A TAX CUT?
WHAT ABOUT MAKING OBAMA EAT A
BUG?
[LAUGHTER]
I BELIEVE THAT'S IN THE TEA
PARTY PLATFORM.
AND WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IT ALL,
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY
RESPONDS TO THREATS.
AND THIS IS THE THIRD TIME.
IT'S LIKE THE BILLY GOATS GRUFF.
OBAMA'S THE TROLL.
[LAUGHTER]
BACK IN DECEMBER THE SMALLEST
BILLY GOAT SAID, "MR. TROLL, LET
ME CROSS YOUR BRIDGE SO I CAN GO
TO THE OTHER SIDE AND RENEW THE
BUSH TAX CUTS OR I WILL CALL YOU
A JOB KILLER."
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, THE TROLL HAD PROMISED THE
PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM BRIDGE
KEEPER THAT HE WOULDN'T LET THIS
SPECIFIC GOAT CROSS.
BUT KEEPING IN MIND HIS OTHER
TROLLISH PRIORITIES, HE MADE THE
POLITICAL CALCULATION TO LET THE
GOAT PASS AND BRING THIS ISSUE
UP LATER WITH A BIGGER GOAT HE
KNEW WAS COMING.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN, THIS SPRING THE
MEDIUM-SIZED BILLY GOAT SHOWED
UP AND SAID, "MR. TROLL, LET ME
CROSS YOUR BRIDGE, SO I CAN CUT
SPENDING OR I WILL SHUT DOWN THE
GOVERNMENT."
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, EVERYBODY HAD SEEN THIS
EXACT MATCH UP IN 1995 AND KNEW
A TROLL COULD WIN IT BY EATING
THE GOAT AND THEN CELEBRATING BY
HAVING SEX WITH A TROLL INTERN.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY?
GETTING COLLEGE CREDIT IN BRIDGE
KEEPING.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THE TROLL SAID "NOW IS NOT
THE TIME.
THERE'S A BIGGER GOAT COMING AND
I TRUST THAT THAT GOAT WILL DO
THE RIGHT THING."
SO HE LET THE MEDIUM GOAT PASS.
THEN, THIS SUMMER THE LARGEST
BILLY GOAT CAME CLOPPING UP AND
SAID, "MR. TROLL, I WILL NOT
RAISE THE DEBT CEILING UNLESS I
GET TO GOUGE OUT YOUR EYES AND
THROW YOU OFF THE BRIDGE."
[LAUGHTER]
SO THE TROLL HAD TO COMPROMISE
BY GOUGING OUT HIS OWN EYES AND
THROWING HIMSELF OFF THE BRIDGE.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS --
WHEN THE FIRST GOAT COMES ALONG,
YOU GOTTA TEAR IT'S HEAD OFF,
HAVE SEX WITH THE NECK HOLE,
MAIL THE CARCASS BACK TO ITS
BROTHERS AND SAY, "ANY OF YOU
OTHER GOAT (bleep) WANT TO PUT
A HOOF ON MY BRIDGE?"
THE END.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE END.
