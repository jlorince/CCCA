REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
RACE.
BUT FIRST OFF, A SHOCKING
REPORT ON ATTEMPTS TO
INFLUENCE THE ELECTION BY A
SHADOWY ORGANIZATION ARMED
WITH UNLIMITED MONEY,
COLBERT SUPERPAC.
NOW FOLKS, I DON'T WANT TO
BRAG BUT WE HAVE RAISED
ENOUGH CASH FOR ME TO HIRE A
TEAM OF PROFESSIONAL
BRAGGERS.
AND ONE OF THOSE DONATIONS
CAME FROM TWO LITTLE KIDS,
CHARLIE AND GRACE, 8 AND 10,
WHO SENT ME $13, AND A NOTE
THAT MEANT ALMOST AS MUCH AS
THEIR MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> JIM.
>> THEY WANT TO DO A
LEMONADE STAND FOR THE
SUPERPAC.
THEY WROTE MOM SAYS WE CAN'T
DO A LEMON SAID STAND FOR IT
UNTIL YOU DECIDE WHAT THE
SUPERPAC STANDS FOR SO LET
US KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
KIDS ASK THE DARNEDEST
QUESTIONS THAT THE PRESS
GENERALLY DOESN'T.
SO WHAT DO WE STAND FOR?
I ASKED YOU TO TELL ME AT
COLBERT SUPERPAC.COM, 53,000
OF YOU RESPONDED AND I USED
YOUR ANSWERS TO CREATE A
WORD CLOUD.
IT TURNS OUT THE THINGS
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT MOST,
PEOPLE.
KIND OF SELF-INVOLVED.
BUT I DUG DEEPER AND I
CREATED ANOTHER WORD CLOUD
OF THE WORDS YOU USED WITH
PEOPLE.
AND THE NEXT MOST COMMONLY
USED WORD, CORPORATIONS,
RIGHT THERE.
THAT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE OF
TWO THINGS.
AND I CHOOSE TO IGNORE ONE
OF THEM.
LEAVING ONLY ONE POSSIBILITY,
YOU WANT COLBERT SUPERPAC TO
STAND FOR THE SELF-EVIDENT
TRUTHS THAT CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE.
SO CHARLIE AND GRACE, YOU
CAN START THAT LEMONADE
STAND NOW.
OR BETTER YET, START LEMCO
INC., THE PURVEYORS OF ALL
NATURAL LEM N ADE.
WARNING, CONTAINS NO LEM OR
ADE.
AND FOLKS THIS IS A CRUCIAL
TIME IN THE FIGHT FOR
CORPORATE CIVIL RIGHTS.
JUST LOOK AT THE HATEFUL
SIGNS THAT OCCUPY WALL
STREET.
CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PEOPLE.
WOW.
I THOUGHT WE WERE PASSED THE
POINT IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE
SOME PEOPLE AREN'T PEOPLE.
JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE
DIFFERENT COLOR SKIN OR
DIFFERENT RELIGION OR WERE
BORN IN A LAWYER'S OFFICE
ONLY EXIST ON PAPER,
