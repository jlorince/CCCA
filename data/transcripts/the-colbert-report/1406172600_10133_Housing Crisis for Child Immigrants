LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANKYOU FOR BEING HERE.
FOLKS, IT'S WONDERFUL TO BEHERE, WONDERFUL TO GET
THAT RESPONSE FROM THEAUDIENCE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'MSURPRISED. I'M NOT SURPRISED
AT ALL, FOLKS, THANK YOU FORTHAT GREETING.
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT.
YOU KNOW I NEED IT, BUT I'MNOT SURPRISED TO GET THAT
KIND OF RESPONSE FROM ANAUDIENCE IN NEW YORK.
I CAN'T EVER IMAGINE LEAVINGTHIS CITY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, AS YOU KNOW AS I
HOPE YOU KNOW AMERICACONTINUES TO FACE A BORDER
CRISIS WITH THOUSANDS OFUNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL
AMERICAN CHILDREN POURINGOVER OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA STILLREJECTS MY PLAN TO BUILD A
KID-APULT
KIDS WILL LOVE IT, IT HASGOT TO BE SAFER THAN THOSE
CHAIN THINGS.
FOLKS, IT IS ONLY GOING TOGET WORSE, WITH OVER 52,000
CHILDREN IN CUSTODY AND90,000 EXPECTED BY THE END
OF THE YEAR THAT IS A FLOOD.
IT'S LIKE EL NINO IS RAININGACTUAL NINOS.
(LAUGHTER)AND NOW THAT THEY ARE HERE,
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHY IT ISCALLED THAT.
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THENAME COMES FROM.
AND FOLKS, NOW THAT THE KIDSARE HERE, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT PARTS OF AMERICATHEY'RE DESTROYING FIRST.
>> FEDS ARE SHIPPING ILLEGALALIENS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
BUT NOT INFORMING THE STATESWHAT IS GOING ON.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE REFUSINGTO SAY WHERE THEY WILL BE
HOUSED ACROSS THE COUNTRY,APPARENTLY ILLEGAL PRIVACY,
THEIR RIGHTS TRUMP AMERICA'SRIGHT TO KNOW.
>> Stephen: YES WHY WON'T THEWHITE HOUSE PUBLISH THE
ADDRESSES OF THESEUNACCOMPANIED MINORS.
COME ON.
I MEAN THE KIDS COULD BE ANYWHERE.
THEY COULD BE IN YOUR TOWN.
THEY COULD BE IN YOUR HOUSE,HELL, THEY COULD BE IN MY HOUSE.
COME TO THINK OF IT I'VE GOTKIDS AT MY HOUSE.
AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE KIDSCOME FROM.
ALL I KNOW IS THEY SHOWED UPONE DAY SLATHERED IN SOME
KIND OF SALSA.
AND DID NOT SPEAK A WORD OFENGLISH.
NOW I GOT TO FOOT THE BILLFOR THEIR SCHOOL AND THEIR
HEALTH CARE.
NOT FAIR.
FOLKS, NOWHERE IS THISPROBLEM MORE PRONOUNCED THAN
IN MAINE, THE PLASTIC BIB STATE.
BECAUSE OUT OF THE 52,000CHILDREN IN FEDERAL
CUSTODY, UNCLE SAM ISUNFAIRLY SADDLING MAINE WITH
A WHOPPING 8 OF THEM.
8! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,THAT MEANS WHEN MAINE GOES
OUT TO DINNER THEY WILLAUTOMATICALLY NOW BE CHARGED
WITH A 15% GRATUITY FORPARTIES OF 8 OR MORE.
THANKFULLY MAINE GOVERNORAND MAN TRYING TO LOOK
GRATEFUL FOR A CRAPPY GIFTPAUL LePAGE CAUGHT WIND OF
THIS AND DECLARED WECANNOT BECOME A STATE THAT
ENCOURAGES ILLEGALIMMIGRATION.
WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
MAINE CAN NOT AFFORD 8KIDS.
THEY NEED THAT MONEY TOSOLVE THE BACKLOG OF CRIMES
COMMITTED EVER SINCE JESSICAFLETCHER MYSTERIOUSLY
DISAPPEARED.
I ASK YOU, WAS IT--MURDER?(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO, IT WAS CANCELLED SHE WROTE.FOLKS, I NEVER REALIZED MAINE
WAS IN SUCH DIRE FINANCIALSTRAITS.
THEY'RE JUST ONE OCTOMAMAAWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY.
