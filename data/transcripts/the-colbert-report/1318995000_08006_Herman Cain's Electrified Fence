>> Stephen: MOVING ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST FREE BALL IT, JIMMY.
JUST WHIP UP SOME GRAPHICS AS I
TALK AND I'LL COME UP WITH
SOMETHING.
NATION, THANKS TO THE LOCKOUT,
THERE MIGHT NOT BE A BASKETBALL
SEASON THIS YEAR.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO WATCH
MILLIONAIRES THROWING ELBOWS,
THERE'S STILL THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, IT IS ACTION-PACKED.
FIRST, BACHMANN WAS UP; THEN SHE
WAS DOWN.
THEN PERRY WAS UP; THEN HE WAS
DOWN.
THEN JON HUNTSMAN ALSO EXISTED.
(LAUGHTER)
SO MANY CHARACTERS, SO MANY
TWISTS.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S LIKE A MEXICAN TELENOVELLA
THAT WANTS TO DEPORT ITSELF.
AND JUST LIKE ANY TELENOVELLA,
WATCH OUT FOR EL DIOS PADRE DELL
PIZZA.
>> HERMAN CAIN IS NOW THE
REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER FOR
PRESIDENT ACCORDING TO THE
LATEST NATIONAL POLL.
>> HERMAN CAIN HAS SURGED TO THE
LEAD IN THE RACE FOR THE
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINATION.
>> TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THIS
NBC/"WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL.
IT SHOWS HERMAN CAIN IS ON TOP
AT 27%.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
HERMAN CAIN IS AHEAD WITH 27%.
AS OPPOSED TO NEWT GINGRICH WHO
IS 27% HEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS, THERE ARE MANY
REASONS WHY CAIN IS SURGING.
LIKE HIS GREAT GRASP OF FOREIGN
POLICY.
>> I'M READY FOR THE GOTCHA
QUESTIONS AND WHEN THEY ASK ME
WHO'S THE QUESTION OF UZBEK,
STAN I'M GOING TO SAY "I DON'T
KNOW, 40 DOUGH KNOW?
HOW'S THAT GOING TO CREATE ONE
JOB.
>> Stephen: IT WON'T CREATE ONE
JOB BECAUSE THEY'LL ALL BEEN
OUTSTORED TO UZBEKY-STAN-STAN
LAND.
AND I HOPE HERMAN CAIN DID NOT
OFFEND THEIR PRESIDENT
CHOP-A-LOP-A.
(LAUGHTER)
SEEN HERE WITH CHINESE PREMIER
CHING CHONG DING-DONG.
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE IS
CAIN'S FAMOUS 999 ECONOMIC PLAN.
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT.
>> 9999% CORPORATE BUSINESS FLAT
TAX, 9% PERSONAL INCOME FLAS TAX
AND 9% NATIONAL SALES TAX.
>> 999.
>> 999.
>> 999.
>> 999.
>> NEIN
NEIN!
NEIN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, ALL CAIN IS SAYING IS
HITLER HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS.
(LAUGHTER)
TAX POLICY.
OF COURSE NOW THAT CAIN'S IN THE
LEAD, THE LAME STREAM GANGRENE
MR. CLEAN MARTIN SHEEN MEDIA HAS
BEEN JUMPING ON HIM OVER THESE
REMARKS HE MADE IN TENNESSEE
OVER THE WEEKEND.
>> LET'S HAVE A REAL FENCE!
20 FEET HIGH WITH BARBED WIRE.
ELECTRIFIED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WITH A SIGN FROM THE OTHER SIDE
THAT SAYS "IT CAN KILL YOU."
THEN I GET CRITICIZED MR. CAIN,
THAT'S INSENSITIVE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INSENSITIVE?
>> Stephen: YEAH!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INSENSITIVE?
BUT IF IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL
BETTER, WE'LL GENERATE THE
LETHAL VOLTAGE WITH WIND POWER.
IS THAT SENSITIVE ENOUGH.
BESIDES, CAIN DIDN'T EVEN MEAN
IT.
AS HE EXPLAINED ON PRESS
McGREGORY.
>> ON IMMIGRATION YOU SAID?
AN EVENT IN TENNESSEE YOU WOULD
BUILD AN ELECTRIFIED FENCE ON
THE BOARDER THAT COULD KILL
PEOPLE IF THEY TRY TO CROSS
ILLEGALLY.
>> THAT'S A JOKE.
>> IT'S A JOKE?
>> THAT WAS A JOKE.
>> THAT'S NOT A SERIOUS
QUESTION?
>> THAT'S NOT A SERIOUS PLAN.
>> YOU GOT A BIG LAUGH OUT OF
THAT.
>> IT'S A JOKE.
>> Stephen: ELECTRIFIED FENCE,
CLASSIC JOKE.
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE "WHO'S ON FIRST?
WHAT'S ON FIRE?
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
IT'S KILLED."
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE REAL PUNCH LINE, THE
REAL PUNCH LINE TO THE JOKE IS
THAT IT'S NOT A JOKE.
AS CAIN CLARIFYED IN PHOENIX THE
NEXT DAY.
>> IT MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED.
I'M NOT WALKING AWAY FROM THAT.
IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT SPEECH,
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO I
FULLY INTEND TO DO SO.
>> Stephen: YES, YOU SEE, HE'S
JOKING UNLESS YOU'RE INTO THE
IDEA.
(LAUGHTER)
IN WHICH CASE HE MEANS IT.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU SAY TO YOUR
GIRLFRIEND "HEY, YOUR OLD
COLLEGE FRIEND DONNA IS CRAZY
AND SO MUCH FUN, SWRESHD A
THREE-WAY."
(LAUGHTER)
"I WAS JOKING!
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?
STOP CRYING!
HEY, I KNOW WHAT WOULD CHEER YOU
UP.
HOW ABOUT WE DO SOME COKE LIKE
WE USED TO DO BACK IN THE DAY!
IT'S A JOKE!
I DON'T WANT TO DO COCAINE!
UNLESS MAYBE DONNA HAS SOME."
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY... ANYWAY, TODAY THE
COLBERT SUPERPAC OFFICIALLY
ENDORSED HERMAN CAIN FOR
PRESIDENT!
... UNLESS YOU'RE NOT INTO HIM
IN WHICH CASE I'M JUST
