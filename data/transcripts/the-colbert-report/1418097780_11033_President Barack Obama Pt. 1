GUYS LIKE US UNDERSTANDLEADERSHIP.
OKAY?
(LAUGHTER)WE UNDERSTAND LEADERSHIP.
ARE YOU STILL PRESIDENT AFTERTHE MIDTERMS?
BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS AREQUITE SURPRISED THAT YOU'RE
DOING ANYTHING AT ALL(LAUGHTER)
THAT SHELLACKING DIDN'T RATTLETHE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL OFF YOUR
PODIUM?
(LAUGHTER)>> LOOK, THE ELECTION DIDN'T GO
AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED...(LAUGHTER)
YOU'LL NOTICE I MADE A LITTLE CORRECTION THERE.
I HAD A LITTLE THOUGHT BUBBLE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT AS PRESIDENT, THE ONLY
OFFICE WHERE YOU'RE ELECTED BYPEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
YOU'VE STILL GOT A LOT OFRESPONSIBILITIES, AND MY
INTENTION IS OVER THE NEXT TWOYEARS IS TO MAKE SURE,
WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WORKING WITHCONGRESS, WE CAN GET EVERYTHING
WE CAN DO DONE TO HELP WORKINGFAMILIES GET AHEAD, TO MAKE SURE
YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO GO TOCOLLEGE --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE A BUNCH OFYOUNG PEOPLE OUT HERE TONIGHT.
THE YOUNG PEOPLE DID NOT TURNOUT TO VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
CAN WE SEE A SHOW OF HANDS, HOWMANY PEOPLE VOTED.
(CHEERING)THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
>> NOT BAD.
>> Stephen: THOUGH I HAVE TOSAY A CROWD OF YOUNG PEOPLE
RAISING THEIR HANDS TO THEIRCHARISMATIC LEADER IS
DISTURBING.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
WHY, SIR -- AND DON'T GIVE THEMANY HINTS -- WHY DO YOU THINK
THE YOUNG PEOPLE DID NOT COMEOUT TO VOTE?
>> I THINK THEY FELT DISCOURAGEDABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN
WASHINGTON.
>> Stephen: MM-HMM.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUES,YOUNG PEOPLE AGREE WE SHOULD
RAISE MINIMUM-WAGE, HAVE EQUALPAY FOR EQUAL WORK, THEY AGREE
WE SHOULD MAKE SURE A FAMILY,WHEN THE CHILD GETS SICK, YOU
CAN STAY HOME WITHOUT LOSINGYOUR JOB.
THEY BELIEVE IN MAKING COLLEGEAFFORDABLE.
THEY BELIEVE IN THESE THINGS.
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HADCONSISTENTLY HOUSE REPUBLICANS
BLOCKING ACTION ON THOSE ITEMSAND AT A CERTAIN POINT FOCUS
FIGURED, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO MAKE ADIFFERENCE.
PART OF MY JOB IN THE NEXT TWOYEARS AND HOPEFULLY PART OF THE
JOB OF MITCH McCONNELL ANDJOHN BOEHNER IS TO CONVINCE
PEOPLE THAT, EVEN IN DIVIDEDGOVERNMENT, WE CAN STILL PUT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AHEAD OFPOLITICS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE GOT
SOME GOOD NEWS.
YOU KNOW, I'M FIRM BUT FAIR ANDYOU HAD SOME GOOD NEWS
THIS WEEK I'D LIKE TO TELL THEPEOPLE ABOUT.
THE JOBS REPORT CAME OUT FORNOVEMBER.
321,000 NEW JOBS IN NOVEMBER(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE ECONOMY IS GROWING AT AFASTER RATE THAN IN YEARS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU FIX THE ECONOMYBEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS?
YOU KNOW YOUR JOB, BUT I WOULDHAVE DONE IT BEFORE THE
ELECTIONS SO PEOPLE WERE HAPPYWHEN THEY VOTED.
AND YOU WIN AND THEN MAYBE YOUDON'T HAVE TO COME ON "THE
COLBERT REPORT."
>> ACTUALLY, THE TRUTH IS THEECONOMY HAD BEEN ON A PRETTY
GOOD RUN. WE'VE HAD 57 STRAIGHTMONTHS OF PRIVATE SECTOR JOB
GROWTH, OVER 10 MILLION JOBSCREATED, MANUFACTURING
STRONGEST SINCE THE '90s.
THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS REBOUNDEDBACK.
>> Stephen: I'LL GIVE IT TOYOU, YOU'VE EMPLOYED A LOT OF
PEOPLE -->> WE HAVE.
>> Stephen: -- MOSTLY ASSECRETARY OF DEFENSE.
>> WELL, THAT BOOSTED OURNUMBERS A LITTLE BIT.
(APPLAUSE)WHAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE
ENOUGH OF UNTIL RECENTLY ISWAGES AND INCOMES GOING UP.
THIS LAST JOBS REPORT STARTED TOINDICATE SOME WAGE GROWTH, BUT
WE'VE STILL GOT MORE WORK TO DO.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUTCREATING JOBS AND TALK ABOUT OUR
NORTHERN BORDER.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE KEYSTONE XLPIPELINE.
CONGRESS IS GONNA PASS THAT NOWTHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN
THERE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT IT, IT'S GONNA CREATE JOBS,THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS
IT'S NOT GONNA RAISE THEPOLLUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE,
YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN THAT,RIGHT?
(AUDIENCE BOOING)>> OBVIOUSLY, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
WEREN'T POLLED.
>> Stephen: NO, THEY'RECHANTING "DOOO-IT"!
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN THAT,
RIGHT?>> KEYSTONE IS GOING THROUGH AN
EVALUATION PROCESS NOW, BEINGHELD UP BY A COURT IN NEBRASKA,
MAKING A DECISION ABOUT WHETHERTHE ROUTE IS LEGAL OR NOT.
YOU KNOW, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE,I DON'T MAKE THE INITIAL
DECISIONS.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT EVALUATESIT.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE GOINGTO SIGN IT WHEN THE BILL COMES
TO YOU?
>> WHAT I SAID IS I'M GOING TOMAKE SURE THAT IF WE LOOK AT
THIS OBJECTIVELY, WE'VE GOT TOMAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT ADDING
TO THE PROBLEM OF CARBON ANDCLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AREGOING TO HAVE TO LIVE IN A WORLD
WHERE WE ALREADY KNOWTEMPERATURES ARE GOING UP, AND
KEYSTONE IS A POTENTIALCONTRIBUTOR OF THAT.
WE HAVE TO EXAMINE THAT ANDWEIGH THAT AGAINST THE AMOUNT OF
JOBS IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TOCREATE, WHICH AREN'T A LOT.
ESSENTIALLY, IT'S CANADIAN OILPASSING THROUGH THE UNITED
STATES TO BE SOLD ON THE WORLDMARKET.
NOT GOING TO PUSH DOWN GASPRICES HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES.
IT'S GOOD FOR CANADA.
IT COULD CREATE A COUPLETHOUSAND JOBS IN THE INITIAL
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIPELINE,BUT WE'VE GOT TO MEASURE THAT
AGAINST WHETHER OR NOT IT ISGOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO AN
OVERALL WARMING OF THE PLANETTHAT COULD BE DISASTROUS
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: CAN I MAKE A
SUGGESTION?
I HAVE A SUGGESTION.
I HAVE A SUGGESTION THAT I THINKMIGHT KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE
KEYSTONE HERE, ALL RIGHT?
>> GO AHEAD.
>> Stephen: THIS ONE'S FREE, OK?YOU CAN USE THIS.
WE DON'T BUILD IT DOWN TOLOUISIANA. WE TAKE IT OVER
THE CANADIAN BORDER, BUILD THATPIPE ALL THE WAY OVER THE
MEXICAN BORDER, WE LEAVE THEOTHER END OF IT OPEN WITH A
SIGN THAT SAYS MUCHO JOBSO.
THE PEOPLE TAKE THE THING ALLTHE WAY OVER THE BORDER, THEY
END UP IN CANADA, AND THECANADIANS ARE TOO POLITE TO KICK
THEM OUT AND THERE'S YOURIMMIGRATION POLICY.
TAKEN CARE OF. THAT'S FREE.
(APPLAUSE)>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RIDICULOUS
IDEA.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE WHERE YOU
ARE AND I AM WHERE I AM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: CAN YOU STICK
AROUND FOR JUST ONE MOMENT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK WITH PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA.
