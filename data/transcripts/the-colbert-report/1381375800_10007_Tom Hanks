IT IS A VAN DYKE?
>> Stephen: IT COULD BE.
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS.
>> Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE YOUREVIL TWIN A LITTLE BIT.
ARE YOU A GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY INTHIS MOVIE?
>> I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR THESROBGS POP LIE TO DECIDE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU'RE A BAD GUYIN THE MOVIE?
>> IS IT A DERIG GOURE THAT IFYOU HAVE A GOATEE YOU HAVE BEEN
CLONED AND YOU ARE A LESSERVERSION OF YOURSELF AND ARE, IN
FACT, THE EVIL SPOT WITH A MOREDEFINED CHIN AND A LITTLE BETTER
JAW MUSCLE?
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOUGROW ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
>> Stephen: IT DOES SOMETHINGTO YOUR MUSCLES?
IT TOOK MUSCLES FOR YOU TO GROWA BEARD?
(LAUGHTER)>> LISTEN, I HAD TO DYE THOSE
HAIRS GRAY FOR SO MANY HOURSTHAT I DON'T EVEN --
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: NOW, THIS MOVIE ISABOUT PIRATES.
>> HIJACKERS, PIRATES, YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THEDIFFERENCE?
>> PIRATES HAVE TRICORNER HATS.
(LAUGHTER)AND MUCH GOOFIER SHIRTS.
>> Stephen: FROM WHAT I'VESEEN IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR JOHNNY
DEPP PIRATE.
>> LITTLE DIFFERENT.
>> Stephen: THESE ARE SOMALIPIRATES.
>> THESE ARE SOMALI ROBBERS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOINGTO STEAL THE SHIP SO THEY CAN
GET MONEY, BECOME RICH, GETCHICKS, BUY CARS AND NOT BE
KILLED BY THE WAR LORDS THAT AREESSENTIALLY FORCING THEM TO DO
THIS FOR A LIVING.
>> Stephen: NOW DOES THISMOVIE HAVE A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE,
A LOT OF MOVIES YOU'VE DONE--ESPECIALLY BIG OSCAR WINNERS--
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CHANGEPEOPLE'S HEARTS AND MINDS.
ANY CHANCES THIS GOING TO CHANGETHE HEARTS AND MINDS OF PEOPLE
IN SHOL YA ABOUT PIRATING?
>> I THINK FOR THE MUSICALNUMBERS.
THROUGH SOME OF THE SONGS ANDDANCES IT MIGHT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: REALLY?
â™ª HI DIDLLEY DEE >> PAUL GREEN GRASS, "UNITED 93"
THE BOURNE FILMS "BLOODY SUNDAY"HE GOES OFF AND CAPTURED AN
ASPECT OF SOMALIA THAT MIGHT NOTBE THE STANDARD VERSION OF WHAT
WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSUME WOULD BEVERY EASY BAD GUYS TO HATE.
IT'S A WAR-TORN PLACE OFCORRUPTION AND HOPELESSNESS AND
WHAT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN AYOUNG MAN WITH A GUN AND WITH
NOTHING TO LOSE?
THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE STATUREOF THE FOUR GUYS THAT HIJACKED
THIS SHIP.
>> Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY SHOTTHIS ON --
>> ON FILM.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: ON FILM.
GOOD.
>> YES, WE DID, SIR.
>> Stephen: (LAUGHS)A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING MOVIES
WITH JUST SKETCH ARTISTS.
BUT YOU DID IT ON ONE OF THE BIGPHAERSING SHIPS, RIGHT?
>> OFF OF MALTA IN THEMEDITERRANEAN SEA.
>> LIKE 650 FOOT VESSELS.
>> I THINK IT'S LIKE 533 BUTSTACKED WITH ALL THE CARGO, AND
THEY HAD TO DO THATSPECIFICALLY.
>> Stephen: THESE GUYS JUSTCOME OUT AND ESSENTIALLY LIKE A
BOSTON WHALER.
>> THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSEIT HAD NEVER HAPPENED PRIOR TO
2009 BECAUSE THE SHIPS ARE --CAN GO FAR, RELATIVELY FAST, AND
HAVE VERY HIGH HULLS ANDPIRATES, HIJACKERS, COULD NOT
GET ON BOARD EXCEPT FOR THESEGUYS WITH THE WENT TO HOME DEPOT
AND BOUGHT A LADDER.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: REALLY?
THEY HAVE ACHIEVED LADDERTECHNOLOGY IN SOMALIA?
>> THEY HAVE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BUT HERE'S WHAT IDON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU
GUYS -- THE ORIGINAL CAPTAIN,CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, THEY USED
HOSES TO TRY TO -- LIKELITERALLY LIKE FIRE HOSES TO
BLOW THEM OFF.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THIS IS ANENORMOUS BOAT WITH BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS WORTH OF CARGO.
>> PEANUTS, TENNIS SHOES, B.M.W.
s, T.V.s.
.>> Stephen: THEY CAN'T AFFORDA SINGLE GUN?
THERE ARE NO GUNS ON THE SHIP.
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED.
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED AT THE TIMEBY INTERNATIONAL LAW.
YOU CANNOT BRING FIREARMS INTOAN INTERNATIONAL PORT ON A
COMMERCIAL CARGO VESSEL.
>> Stephen: THERE'S NO SECONDAMENDMENT AT SEA.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
>> LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, THEREIS IN SOMALIA WHERE EVERYBODY
HAS A GUN.

GOING OUT TO SEA ON THIS SHIP?

>> Stephen: HOW MANY DAYS?
(LAUGHTER)IS THERE SOME SECRET HERE YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO SNOW THERE'S ATWO-MONTH GAP IN YOUR LIFE YOU
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUTON MALTA.
>> I'M GONNA SAY TWO MONTHS, YOUKNOW.
BETTER PART OF TEN WEEKS.
>> Stephen: A GUY LIKE YOU ATTHIS POINT, CAN'T YOU GO TO SOME
BIG GREEN SOUND STAGE AND POINTAT TENNIS BALLS GLUED TO THE
WALL AND SAY "LOOK, PIRATES,THEY'RE COMING!"
>> IN FACT, THERE'S A CD-ROM OFALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED.
YOU ENTER INTO THE CODE AND MYHANDS WILL MOVE ANY WAY YOU WANT
ME TO, MY EYES WITH WELL YOUHAVE WITH TEARS AT THE PUNCH OF
A BUTTON.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET THAT?
(LAUGHTER)I'VE GOT SOME MOVIES I'D LIKE TO
PUT TOM HANKS IN.
WOULD YOU RATHER DO SOMETHINGFICTION OR NONFICTION?
I WAS WATCHING IT WITH SOMEBODYWHO DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ALE A
REAL STORY.
>> I'D LIKE -- I'VE ALWAYS BEENINTERESTED IN NONFICTION.
I STARTED READING IT VERY YOUNGAND I THOUGHT WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED BY AND LARGE IS MOREINTERESTING THAN ANYTHING YOU
CAN SAY.
EVEN, LIKE, READING LIKE FICTIONBOOKS BUT SET IN NONFICTION
AREAS LIKE "IN COLD BLOOD" ORLEON YOU ARE REUS NOVELS.
