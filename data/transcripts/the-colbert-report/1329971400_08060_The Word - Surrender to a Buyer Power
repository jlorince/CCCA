( APPLAUSE )
MOVING ON.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A
TIME WHEN AMERICANS LIVED IN
SMALL COMMUNITIES.
NEIGHBORS WOULD LOOK OUT FOR
EACH OTHER, LEND YOU A CUP OF
SUGAR, HELP YOU PAINT THE HOUSE,
BAND TOGETHER TO DRIVE OUT THE
IRISH.
THESE DAYS, WITH BIG CITIES AND
THE INTERNET, WE FEEL
INCREASINGLY ISOLATED,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU JOIN GOOGLE
PLUS.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE, WE HAVE
FAITH THAT GOD IS LOOKING OUT
FOR US, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR
SURE UNTIL YOU DIE.
LUCKILY, THE FREE MARKET
PROVIDES AN ALL-KNOWING POWER
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE TANGIBLE,
AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
WORD
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SURRENDER TO A BEAR POWER.
AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE ALL CRAVE TO
BE KNOWN AND NOT JUST IN THE
BIBLICAL SENSE.
( LAUGHTER ).
THANKFULLY, THERE'S SOMEONE OUT
THERE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT US
HERE ON EARTH, RETAILERS.
FOLKS, YOU SEE, THEY KNOW US
BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE CHECKING OUT,
THEY'RE CHECKING US OUT.
FOR INSTANCE, A COMPANY CALLED
INFOSYS MAKES SHELVING UNITS
THAT HAVE SENSORS THAT CAN TELL
HOW LONG A CUSTOMER LINGERS AT
THE DISPLAY.
SO, MEN, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A
RACK MAY BE STARING AT YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BUT NO ONE-- NO ONE REALLY
UNDERSTANDS--
( CHEERS )
NO ONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THEIR
CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN TARGET.
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK
TIMES," TARGET'S DATABASES KNOW
YOUR AGE, WHETHER YOU ARE
MARRIED AND HAVE KIDS, WHICH
PART OF TOWN YOU LIVE IN, HOW
LONG IT TAKES YOU TO DRIVE TO
THE STORE, YOUR ESTIMATED
SALARY, WHETHER YOU'VE MOVED
REAM, WHAT CREDIT CARD YOU CARRY
IN YOUR WALLET, AND WHAT WEB
SITES YOU VISIT.
YES, TARGET KNOWS WHAT WEB SITES
YOU VISIT.
AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS ON
THE WEB, THEY NOW KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY KNOW.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BUT GATHERING THE INFORMATION IS
ONLY PART OF THE EQUATION.
THE REST IS EQUATIONS.
USING SOMETHING CALLED
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS, TARGET
DOESN'T JUST TRACK WHEN YOU BUY
SHEETS.
THEY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
BETWEEN THEM.
>> TARGET LOOKS AT EVERYTHING
THAT WOMEN BUY.
AND WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND IS IF A
WOMAN ALL OF A SUDDEN STARTS
BUYING UNSCENTED LOTION AND THEN
STARTS BUYING CERTAIN TYPES OF
VITAMINS LIKE ZINC AND
MAGNESIUM, THOSE ARE ALL SIGNALS
THAT THAT WOMAN IS PREGNANT.
USING THEIR COMPUTER ALGRISMS,
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE,
WITHIN A TWO-WEEK WINDOW, WHEN
SHE'S DUE.
>> Stephen:  THEY CAN SENSE
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY WITHOUT
EVEN MEETING YOU.
THEY'RE LIKE AN OBGYN KENOBI.
TARGET KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE MISSED
YOUR PERIOD, PERIOD.
( LAUGHTER )
FOR EXAMPLE, A FAWGTHS RECENTLY
STORMED INTO A TARGET ANGRILY
WAVING COUPONS FOR BABY SUPPLIES
THAT WERE MAILED TO HIS TEENAGED
DAUGHTER.
NOW, A FEW DAYS LATER, WHEN THE
MANAGER CALLED TO APOLOGIZE, THE
MAN SAID, "I HAD A TALK WITH MY
DAUGHTER.
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S BEEN SOME
ACTIVITIES IN MY HOUSE I HAVEN'T
BEEN COMPLETELY AWARE OF.
SHE'S DUE IN AUGUST."
( APPLAUSE )
JUST IN TIME FOR
NOT-GOING-BACK-TO-SCHOOL SALES.
THE POINT IS-- PLAWZ.
( CHEERS )
( APPLAUSE )
THE POINT IS, TARGET KNEW THIS
GIRL BETTER THAN HER OWN FATHER,
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
KNOWLEDGE MEANS PROFITS.
PEOPLE TEND TO SHOP AT THE SAME
PLACES EVERY WEEK, AND IT'S HARD
FOR STORES TO CHANGE THOSE
HABITS.
BUT DURING PERIODS OF
TRANSITION, LIKE HAVING A BABY,
THE CUSTOMER IS RIPE FOR RETAIL
CONVERSION, AND THE MARKETER WHO
KNOWS THEY'RE IN A WEAKENED
STATE CAN SCOOP THEM UP LIKE THE
GENTLE LOVING HAND OF A
PREDATORY CULT.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW, AS ONE--
( APPLAUSE )
AS ONE TARGET MARKETING ANALYST
EXPLAINED, "WE KNEW IF WE COULD
IDENTIFY WOMEN IN THEIR SECOND
TRIMESTER, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
WE COULD CAPTURE THEM FOR
YEARS."
YES, THE MISSION IS TO IDENTIFY
AND CAPTURE.
THEY'RE LIKE A MARKETING STRIKE
FORCE.
AND, FOLKS, IF I HAVE JUST ONE
QUIBBLE, IT'S THAT TARGET, LIKE
GOD, IS RELUCTANT TO REVEAL
ITSELF IN OUR LIVES.
>> TARGET FOUND IF THEY SENT
PREGNANT WOMEN A BUNCH OF ADS
FOR BABY STUFF AND THAT WOMAN
HAD NEVER TOLD TARGET SHE WAS
PREGNANT, A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE
OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WOULD STOP
GOING TO TARGET ALL TOGETHER.
THEY DIDN'T LIKE BEING SPIED ON.
BUT IF TARGET CAMOUFLAGED WHAT
IT KNEW, IF IT, FOR INSTANCE,
PUT ADS FOR CRIBS NEXT TO
LAWNMOWERS, THEN THE CUSTOMERS
WHO OFFED THOSE COUPONS JUST
ASSUMED THAT THEY WERE RANDOM.
>> Stephen:  YES, TARGET WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.
( LAUGHTER ).
BUT, FOLKS, ONCE YOU ACCEPT--
ONCE YOU ACCEPT TARGET INTO YOUR
HEART, YOU'LL FIND THEY'RE
EVERYWHERE, WATCHING OVER YOU
DURING THE MOST IMPORTANT
PASSAGES OF YOUR LIFE.
NOW, TRUE, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO STOP YOUR WIFE FROM CHEATING
ON YOU, BUT THEY CAN NOTICE
SHE'S BUYING PERFUME AND
LINGERIE AND THEN SEND YOU A
COUPON FOR A HOT PLATE FOR YOUR
NEW STUDIO APARTMENT.
AND THEY CANNOT KEEP YOUR SON
FROM BEING GAY.
WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT BEFORE HE
DOES, THEY CAN SEND HEM A COUPON
FOR A FREE DVD BECAUSE I BELIEVE
SEASON TWO OF "GLEE" IS NOT A
CHOICE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
SO RETAIL NATION, TAKE SOLACE IN
THE FACT THAT TARGET WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR YOU IN THE MOST
TROUBLED TIMES.
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THE BEACH
OF YOUR LIFE AND SEE ONLY ONE
SET OF FOOTPRINTS, YOU WEREN'T
ALONE.
THAT'S WHEN TARGET WAS SELLING
YOU FLIP-FLOPS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
AND THAT'S THE
