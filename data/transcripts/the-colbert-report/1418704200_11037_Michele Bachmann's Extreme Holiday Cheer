LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'VEBEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE
NEWS LATELY, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCHTHE NEWS, YOU KNOW THAT THIS
IS --(CHEERING)
-- FOLKS, THIS IS MY LAST WEEKHERE AT "THE REPORT."
(AWWWWW)I'M SORRY.
DID NO ONE TELL YOU?
BUT FOLKS, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONESTEPPING DOWN FROM THE NATIONAL
SPOTLIGHT.
SO IS MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMANAND WAX FIGURE OF MICHELE
BACHMANN, MICHELE BACHMANN.
MICHELE HAS DECIDED NOT TO SEEKA FIFTH TERM, OPTING INSTEAD TO
STAY HOME AND CATCH UP ON HERBLINKING.
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU FOLKS, I AMGLAD TO KNOW THAT
BACHMANN IS NOT GOINGQUIETLY.
LAST WEEK, AS SHE AND HER FAMILYPOSED FOR A PICTURE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE HOLIDAY PARTY, BACHMANNTURNED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
SAID, "MR. PRESIDENT, YOU NEEDTO BOMB THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR
FACILITIES BECAUSE, IF YOUDON'T, IRAN WILL HAVE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON ON YOUR WATCH."
NOW SOME MAY SAY THAT'SINAPPROPRIATE FOR A HOLIDAY
PARTY, BUT FOLKS SHE'SCONSISTANT.
BACHMANN SAYS THE SAME THING ONALL OF HER CHRISTMAS CARDS.
WE'RE WITH YOU MICHELE. WE'REWITH YOU.
BESIDES, HOLIDAY PARTY OR NOT,BACHMANN KNOWS IT'S CRUCIAL TO
KEEP IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEARWEAPON.
>> THIS IS THE ULTIMATE INHIGH-STAKES BINGO.
>> Stephen: AND BINGO, OFCOURSE, THE ULTIMATE HIGH-STAKES
GAME.
JUST LOOK HOW THE STRESS AGESTHE PLAYERS.
THAT GIRL IS 17!
AND HOW DID OBAMA RESPOND TO HERSAGE FOREIGN POLICY ADVICE?
ACCORDING TO BACHMANN, THEPRESIDENT "LAUGHED AT ME AND
SAID, 'WELL, MICHELE, IT'S JUSTNOT THAT EASY .'"
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT SURPRISED THISMAN LAUGHED.
LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S REACTIONTO TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I TOLD HIM
HE SHOULD LISTEN TO MICHELEBACHMANN.
(LAUGHTER)GOD SPEED.
GOD SPEED, MICHELE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEPT UP THATCRAZY CONSERVATIVE CHARACTER FOR
EIGHT YEARS.
