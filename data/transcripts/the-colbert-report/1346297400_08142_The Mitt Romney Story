(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US!
PLEASE!
THANK YOU.
NATION, FOLKS, TONIGHT...
TONIGHT IS, OF COURSE, THE SECOND-ISH NIGHT OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION
IN TAMPA, FLORIDA AND, FOLKS, I AM JACKED!
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS DRINKING GAME WHERE
I TAKE A SHOT OF JACK EVERY TIME I SEE AN OLD WHITE MAN.
(LAUGHTER) I'LL JUST PUT A NIPPLE ON THAT,
SAVE THAT FOR LATER.
OKAY.
NOW, TECHNICALLY IT'S NIGHT THREE OF THE CONVENTION BUT BECAUSE OF HURRICANE ISAAC
MONDAY NIGHT WAS VERY SHORT.
JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR R.N.C.
CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS TO START THE NATIONAL DEBT CLOCK WHICH I BELIEVE ALSO TRACKS MITT
ROMNEY'S NET WORTH.
(LAUGHTER) MONDAY NIGHT, THE WHOLE THING WAS OVER IN TEN MINUTES, BUT
LAST NIGHT MORE THAN MADE UP FOR THAT BY GOING ON FOREVER.
(LAUGHTER) OH, THE SPEECHES!
THE PAGEANTRY!
THE FUN!
IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING...
(LAUGHTER).
IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING IF SANTA KEPT ALL THE GIFTS FOR HIMSELF AND FILLED STOCKINGS
WITH CLEAN COAL.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK HAS A DIFFERENT THEME.
LAST NIGHT'S THEME WAS "WE BUILT IT." "IT," BEING, I ASSUME MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER) I ALWAYS WONDERED WHO ASSEMBLED HIM BECAUSE THAT IS QUALITY WORK.
BUT, OF COURSE, THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE MISSION FOR THIS ENTIRE WEEK.
>> I THINK A BIG PART OF THIS WEEK IS TELLING THE MITT ROMNEY STORY OF... ABOUT A GOOD AND
DECENT MAN THAT KNOWS HOW TO FIX THINGS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO TELL THE MITT ROMNEY STORY, WHICH IS A STORY ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM.
>> THIS WEEK IS ABOUT TELLING THE MITT ROMNEY STORY.
>> WE HAVE TO TELL THE MITT ROMNEY STORY.
>> WE NEED TO TELL THE MITT ROMNEY STORY.
>> WE HAVE TO TELL THE MITT ROMNEY STORY.
>> IT'S ALSO TELLING THE MITT ROMNEY STORY.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: SOUNDS GOOD!
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
MEANWHILE, HAVE YOU HEARD THE REINCE PRIEBUS STORY?
IT'S A HEARTBREAKING TALE OF A BROKEN RECORD WHO CHAIRS THE R.N.C.
(LAUGHTER) IN THE MOVIE HE'LL BE PLAYED BY DUSTIN HOFFMAN FROM "RAIN MAN." DEFINITELY.
DEFINITELY GONNA TELL THE MITT ROMNEY STORY.
DEFINITELY GOT TO TELL IT.
(LAUGHTER) OSCAR, PLEASE!
OSCAR!
