BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M BEGINNING TO WORRY THAT THEAPOCALYPSE MAY NOT START IN
SYRIA AFTER ALL.
>> THE U.S. AND RUSSIA SAY THEYHAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL
AVERT AMERICAN AIR STRIKES BYREMOVING OR DESTROYING ALL
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.
>> I SAY THIS PROVES OBAMA IS ASECRET MUSLIM.
HE'S REFUSING TO BOMB SOMEONEJUST TO KEEP JESUS FROM COMING
BACK!
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S KIND OF PETTY.
SO I AM PRAYING, PRAYING, THISDIPLOMATIC SOLUTION FALLS
THROUGH BECAUSE, FRANKLY, I DONOT WANT TO SEE THE DAY OBAMA
FINALLY EARNS THE NOBEL PEACEPRIZE HE ALREADY WON.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WITH THE DEFACE ALREADY
HAMMERED OUT, HOW COULD ITPOSSIBLY FALL THROUGH?
>> U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHNKERRY SAID THEY WOULD SEEK A
UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTION WITHSERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR SYRIA
IF IT FAILS TO HAND OVER ITSCHEMICAL WEAPONS.
>> THE U.S. HAS SAID THE U.N.
RESOLUTION DOESN'T HAVE TOTHREATEN MILITARY ACTION.
>> Stephen: OH.
THE U.N. IS HANDLING IT.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, THAT MAKES IT RATHER
U.N.-LIKELY TO SUCCEED.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, FOR PETE'S SAKE --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOR PETE'S SAKE THESE PEOPLE
STILL WEAR HEAD PHONES LIKETHIS.
(LAUGHTER)GUYS, COME ON!

AND HERE TO TELL ME HOW THE U.N.

ANDREW, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ANDREW, DO YOU BELIEVE WHEN IT
COMES TO TAKING MILITARY ACTIONAGAINST BASHAR AL-ASSAD USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE YOU INFAVOR OF DOING SOMETHING OR
DOING NOTHING?
>> DOING SOMETHING THAT DOES NOTMEAN WE GET INVOLVED IN SOMEONE
ELSE'S CIVIL WAR.

YOU WANT TO GET THE U.N.
INVOLVED?
>> NO, I WANT RUSSIA WHICH ISTHE CRITICAL MEMBER OF THE
SECURITY COUNCIL INVOLVED HEREAND CHINA ON THE SECURITY
COUNCIL WHO HAVE TAKENRESPONSIBILITY SAYING WE'RE

PLACES ALONE.

OF PEOPLE DIE, WE LOST TRILLIONSOF DOLLARS.
IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET ITDONE AND NOT PROVOKE OUTCRY AND
ACTUALLY GET ASSAD'S COOPERATIONTHEN GETTING RUSSIA AND CHINA TO
DO OUR DIRTY WORK FOR US IS AGREAT THING.
OUR GOAL IS NOT TO HAVE THEBIGGEST EGO IN THE WORLD --.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE STICK?
>> THE STICK IS THAT WE THREATENMILITARY STRIKES AGAINST THEM.
>> Stephen: RIGHT!
AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GOTHROUGH WITH THAT!
AND IF THEY DON'T COMPLY AND IFASSAD DOES USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAIN OBAMA HAS A MUCH STRONGERCASE TO MAKE "LOOK, WE TRIED
PEACE, WE TRIED THIS PROCESS,NOW IT DOESN'T WORK, WE HAVE A
RIGHT TO STOP THESE WEAPONS."
>> Stephen: SO YOU BELIEVE THATIF THE DEAL DOESN'T GO THROUGH,
IF IT FALLS APART IT'S TIME TOTURN DAMASCUS INTO THE
BOOM-BOOM?
(LAUGHTER)>> NO, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BLOW UPCHEMICAL WEAPONS SITES WITHOUT
CREATING A NIGHTMARE, WITHOUTCREATING THE VERY THING YOU'RE
TRYING TO AVOID.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'S SENDING AMESSAGE.
>> YOU CAN'T SEND A MISSILE TOBLOW SARIN GAS HALFWAY ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.
YOU HAVE TO SECURE THEM.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO SEND AMESSAGE.
>> WE SENT IT T MESSAGE, IT WASRECEIVED IN DAMASCUS, THEY GAVE
UP.
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE THAT!
ASSAD SURRENDERED.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE TRYING --HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET.
YOU WANT TO BE A UNITED STATESCITIZEN, TRUE?
>> YES, PLEASE.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO BE AUNITED STATES CITIZEN.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TOUNDERSTAND THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, ALLRIGHT?
THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO US.

WANT.
EVERYBODY SHOULD SAY "HEY,THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE AMERICA DID
IT."
(LAUGHTER)>> WHY NOT USE THE RULES TO GET
WHAT WE WANT DONE WITHOUT HAVINGTO OURSELVES ACTUALLY HAVING TO
DO IT?
>> Stephen: AND USE THE U.N.
RESOLUTION?
>> THE U.N. IS A USEFULINSTITUTION TO COVER AND TO
EXECUTE GREAT POWER DESIGNS.
>> Stephen: WHAT GREAT POWER?
WHAT WAR HAVE THEY EVERPREVENTD?
>> WELL, WE MAY HAVE JUSTPREVENTED THIS ONE AND I ALE
TELL YOU WHY.
>> Stephen: BUT WE DON'T KNOWBECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!
>> WE DON'T KNOW YET.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN'T PROVE ANEGATIVE.
>> WHAT WE HAVE PREVENTD IS ANYMAJOR WAR BETWEEN GREAT POWERS.

CHINA THEY WOULD VETO IT ANDTHEN WE'D HAVE TO STOP.
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE NOT WRONG.
THAT'S WHY WE -- WE TRY --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU BECOME ASUPERPOWER IF IT DOESN'T
EXERCISE SUPERPOWERS?
THAT'S LIKE SAYING "I'MFANTASTIC DANCER I JUST DON'T
