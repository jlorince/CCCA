(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, REGULAR VIEWERS MAY HAVE
NOTICED A RASH OF NEW BABIES
AMONG MY STAFF IN THE LAST
COUPLE OF MONTHS.
I JUST WANT TO QUELL RUMORS THAT
THIS IS DUE TO A CATASTROPHIC
SPILL OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FORMULA 401 NINE MONTHS AGO.
THAT WAS MOPPED UP.
WITH THAT SET SETED.
WELCOME TO THE NEWEST MEMBER OF
THE COLBERT NATION, GIANCARLO
FRANCIS DINELLO WHO, JUDGING BY
HIS NAME, WAS BORN IN 19th
CENTURY VENICE.
(LAUGHTER)
MY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ENTIRE
FAMILY AND TO RILEY DINELLO.
SHOULD YOU EVER FEEL IGNORED
THESE NEXT FEW MONTHS JUST PEE
ON THE CARPET LIKE YOU DO IN MY
OFFICE.
(LAUGHTER)
GOOD NIGHT,
