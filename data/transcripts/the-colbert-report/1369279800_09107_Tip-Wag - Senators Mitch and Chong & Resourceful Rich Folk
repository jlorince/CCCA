AS I NEED TO BE.
NOW, NATION, SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE A LONE VOICE CRYING IN THE
WILDERNESS.
THEN I PUT MY GLASSES BACK ON
AND REALIZE THESE TREES ARE
ACTUALLY JUST CAMERAS.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOLKS, OF COURSE, I DON'T HAVE
TO REMIND YOU THAT WE ARE LOSING
THE WAR ON MARIJUANA, UNLESS
YOU'RE A DOPER, IN WHICH CASE
YOU HAVE THE SHORT-TERM MEMORY
OF A SAND CRAB.
AND THIS WEEK THE POT PROBLEM
ONLY GOT WORSE.
>> KENTUCKY'S TWO SENATORS SAY
THEY ARE NOT GIVING UP ON
INDUSTRIAL HEMP.
SENATORS MITCH McCONNELL AND
RAND PAUL WERE JOINED BY SEVERAL
KENTUCKY CONGRESSMEN IN SIGNING
A LETTER TO THE, A MEASURE THAT
WOULD ALLOW INDUSTRIAL HEMP
FARMING IN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT LIFTS ITS CURRENT
RESTRICTIONS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THESE SENATORS ARE TRYING TO
TURN KENTUCKY INTO A DEN OF THIN
INSTEAD OF A WHOLESOME PLACE TO
POUND BURBON WHILE WATCHING TINY
PEOPLE WHIP HORSES FOR SPORT.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M GIVING A
WAG OF MY FINGER TO SENATORS
MITCH AND CHONG HERE.
OF COURSE, THESE KENTUCKY
KEN-TOKERS ARE SAYING HEMP IS
DIFFERENT FROM MARIJUANA BECAUSE
IT CONTAINS ALMOST NO T.H.C. AND
IS USED TO MAKE SUSTAINABLE
PRODUCTS LIKE ROPE AND PAPER.
IN FACT WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS
SUPPORT FOR HEMP RAND PAUL SAID
QUOTE, "I'M FASCINATED BY THE
PAPER THING.
ONE ACRE OF HEMP IS EQUAL TO TWO
ACRES OF TREES.
TREES TAKE 15 YEARS AND HEMP ONE
SEASON.
SOMEBODY SAID THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE IS IS ON HEMP
PAPER.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR
NOT.
I'VE HEARD IT THOUGH."
SADLY, FOLKS...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SADLY, PUFF THE MAGIC SENATOR
HERE MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE DECLARATION BEING
WRITTEN ON HEMP.
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY IT'S SIGNED
BY FOUNDING FATHERS JOHN
HANCOCK, BEN FRANKLIN AND
ZEPPELIN RULES.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, EVERYBODY LOVES
DISNEY WORLD.
THE RIDES, THE COSTUMES, THE
WALT-SICLES.
SO MUCH FUN.
BUT WIN THING RUINS THE DISNEY
MAGIC AND THAT'S THE LONG LINES.
FORTUNATELY IF YOU'VE GOT THE
CASH, THERE'S A WAY TO GET A
JUMP ON THE RIFFRAFF.
>> CASTING LIGHT ON HOW THE RICH
HIT DISNEY WORLD.
THE NEW YORK POST REPORTS
THEY'RE HIRING DISABLED PEOPLE
TO POSE AS FAMILY MEMBERS SO
THEY CAN JUMP TO THE FRONT OF
THE LINES WITH THEIR KIDS.
THE BLACK MARKET DISNEY GUIDES
RUN $130 AN HOUR OR JUST OVER
$1,000 A DAY.
>> Stephen: YES, SKIP LINES BY
HIRING THE DISABLED OR JUST GO
TO THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS AND
STEAL F.D.R.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM GIVING
THE NEXT TIP OF MY HAT TO
RESOURCEFUL RICH FOLK.
TRAVELING WITH THE SPECIAL NEEDS
SET DOES BRING SPECIAL PERKS.
>> ONE MOM SPEAKING OUT THIS
MORNING HAS NO SHAME IN HER
GAME.
SHE SAYS, HEY, MY DAUGHTER
WAITED ONE MINUTE TO RIDE IT'S A
SMALL WORLD.
THE OTHER KIDS HAD TO WAIT MORE
THAN TWO HOURS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
LOSERS.
THANKS TO HER LITTLE HANDY-PAL,
THAT LITTLE GIRL JUST BLEW PAST
YOUR SORRY ASSES SO SHE COULD BE
THE FIRST TO HEAR A MESSAGE OF
UNITY AND UNDERSTANDING.
SUCKS TO BE YOU!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOW THAT IT'S OUT THERE, I HAVE
AN ADMISSION TO MAKE.
I TOO HAVE BEEN HITCHING A RIGHT
ON THE GRAVY WHEELCHAIR.
IN FACT, TO GET SPECIAL STUFF I
HAVE A WHOLE STABLE FULL OF
HANDICAPPEDDED PEOPLE.
I MEAN NOT LITERALLY.
IT'S HEATED.
THANKS TO THEM, I GET THE BEST
PARKING SPOTS.
I'M ALWAYS FIRST TO BOARD THE
PLANE.
AND OH, THE WISHES THEY MAKE.
I MET MICHAEL JORDAN.
I GOT A TOUR OF NASA.
I SEEN SWAM WITH DOLPHINS.
IT'S A REAL SHAME, IT'S A REAL
SHAME THAT THE KID'S DOCTORS
SAID HE COULDN'T GET IN THE
WATER CAUSE OF HIS THING.
BUT HE STILL HAD FUN.
I SPRAYD HIM WITH A SUPER
SOAKER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
