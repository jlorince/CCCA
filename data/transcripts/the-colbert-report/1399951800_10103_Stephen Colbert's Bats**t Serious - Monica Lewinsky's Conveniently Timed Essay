>> NATION-- SORRY, NATION, ILOVE A GOOD COMEBACK STORY,
THAT'S WHY MY FAVORITE ROCKYMOVIE IS THE ONE WITH ROCKY
IN IT.
SO I WAS THRILLED TO HEARTHAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST
STARS OF THE 1990s IS MAKINGA HUGE COMEBACK.
>> MONICA LEWINSKY, THAT'SHER RIGHT THERE.
>> SHE'S WRITTEN AN ARTICLEIN "VANITY FAIR".
>> SHE'S BACK.
>> YUP, SHE'S BACK.
>> SHE'S BACK.
>> GUESS WHO'S BACK.
>> YES, SHE'S BACK.
THAT'S WHY WE SOUND SO UPSET.
LEWINSKY WROTE THE COVERSTORY FOR THIS MONTH'S
"VANITY FAIR" TITLED SHAMEAND SURVIVOR.
IT'S LIKE PRIDE ANDPREJUDICE ONLY THE HEROINE
ISN'T THE ONE WHO GOTTHE HAPPY ENDING.
FOR THOSE OF YOU BORN AFTERTHE LEWINSKY SCANDAL FIRST,
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTINGYOUR LEARNER'S PERMIT.
SECOND, MONICA LEWINSKY ISTHE FORMER WHITE HOUSE
INTERN WHOSE AFFAIR WITHBILL CLINTON PARALYZED OUR
GOVERNMENT AS CONGRESSATTACKED THE PRESIDENT WITH
A PATHOLOGICAL HOSTILITY,BUT HE WAS WHITE SO IT
BACKFIRED.
NOW LEWINSKY'S RETURN ISGREAT NEWS FOR REPUBLICANS
BECAUSE THIS REMINDER OF THEDARKEST CHAPTER OF THE
CLINTON LEGACY COMES RIGHTBEFORE HILLARY LAUNCHES HER
2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
NOW THAT CAMPAIGN IS OVER.
IT'S DONE, TAKE TAFT'S BATHTUBOUT OF STORAGE BECAUSE WE'RE
GETTING PRESIDENT CHRISCHRISTIE.
>> Stephen: IT'S EXACTLYWHAT HILLARY WANTS US TO
THINK.
BECAUSE IN REALITY, THIS ISALL PART OF HER PLAN.
>> I HONESTLY THINK THIS ISPART OF THE CLINTON PLAN OF
SORT OF TRYING TO GET THISOUT THERE NOW.
>> WHY NOW?
THERE'S A LOT OF CONSPIRACYTHEORIES FLOATING OUT ON THE
TIMING OF THIS ARTICLE.
>> THE TIMING IS CERTAINLYCOMING UNDER QUESTION.
>> Stephen: YES, THE TIMINGIS CERTAINLY COMING UNDER
QUESTION.
WHAT QUESTIONS?
WELL, THERE'S ONE RIGHTTHERE.
BUT ARE THERE OTHERQUESTIONS? THAT MAKES TWO.
AND FOLKS WHENS THERE'S ACONSPIRACY AFOOT I FIND THE
TRUTH IN MY LONG TWICERUNNING SEGMENT STEPHEN
COLBERT'S [BLEEP]SERIOUS.
NATION, PREPARE TO HAVE YOURMIND BLOWN AS I EXPOSE THE
SECRET NETWORKS OF POWERCONSPIRING TO CONTROL OUR
EVERY MOVE FOR INSTANCESOMEHOW MY TELEPROMPTER
KNOWS EVERYTHING I'M GOINGTO SAY BEFORE I SAY IT.
LIKE THIS SENTENCE I'MSAYING RIGHT NOW NO MATTER
HOW FAST I SAY IT, EGGPLANT,TUBE SOCK, POTATO SALAD, ALL
THOSE WORDS ARE ALREADY INTHERE.
FOLKS, HILLARY WAS BEHINDTHIS ARTICLE JUST AS SURELY
AS SHE WAS BEHIND THE WOMANWHO THREW A SHOE AT HER LAST
MONTH.
I MEAN IF SHE WERE NOT ANEVIL MANIPULATER WHY IS MY
IMPRESSION OF HER THIS.
(APPLAUSE)BUT THE QUESTION IS WHY DID
HILLARY WANT THIS NEWS OUTNOW.
>> TIMING OF IT BENEFITSHILLARY, IT IS GOOD TO GET
IT OUT THERE TALK ABOUT IT,AND DON'T HIDE WAITING FOR
IT, YOU KNOW, TO REAR ITSHEAD AGAIN.
>> I REALLY WONDER IF THISISN'T AN EFFORT ON THE
CLINTON'S PART TO GET THATSTORY OUT OF THE WAY.
>> RUTH MARCUS WROTE IN THE"WASHINGTON POST" IF AND
WHEN A CLINTON PRESIDENTIALANNOUNCEMENT COMES LEWINSKY
IS GOING TO BE OLD NEWS.
>> Stephen: HILLARY ISTRYING TO MAKE THIS
16-YEAR-OLD NEWS OLDNEWS.
YOU SEE IF WE TALK ABOUT THELEWINSKY SCANDAL NOW THEN WE
WON'T BE TALKING ABOUT ITWHEN SHE'S RUNNING IN 2016,
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THINGTHE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA IS
KNOWN FOR IT IS LETTINGTHINGS GO.
UNLESS, WAIT, UNLESS THAT'SJUST WHAT SHE WANTS US TO
THINK SHE WANTS US TO THINKSHE THINKS.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE THE PRINCESS OF
DARKNESS ALWAYS HAS ANULTERIOR MOTIVE, RIGHT
ERIC BOLLING.
>> THE THEORY THAT I'MHEARING IS THIS COULD BE
COMPLETELY OFF BASE.
>> Stephen: A GOOD CHANCETHIS IS [BLEEP] GO AHEAD.
>> IS THAT THIS PROVIDESSYMPATHY FOR HILLARY TO REMIND
EVERYONE THAT BILL CLINTON WAS AJERK.
>> Stephen: BUSTED!
SHE WANTS US TO SAY OH, POORHILLARY.
HER HUSBAND WAS SUCH A JERK.LET'S ELECT HER SO
HE COULD BE BACK IN THEWHITE HOUSE BUT WITH MORE
FREE TIME.
BUT IF HILLARY REALLYINSTRUCTED "VANITY FAIR" TO
PRINT MONICA LEWINSKY'SARTICLE THERE MUST BE A
PAPER TRAIL.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CANCONTROL THE MEDIA WITH HER
MIND.
OR CAN SHE?
JIM?
>> YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARENODDING THAT WOULD MEAN
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMELEVEL OF COLLUSION WITH THE
CLINTONS.
>> THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BEBECAUSE THE MEDIA AND
DEMOCRATS CAN COMMUNICATEWITHOUT TALKING.
>> Stephen: AHA!!
THE MEDIA CAN COMMUNICATEWITH DEMOCRATS BY READING
THEIR THOUGHTS!
BUT FOX NEWS CAUGHT THEMBECAUSE THEY CAN COMMUNICATE
WITHOUT THINKING AT ALL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NAILED YOU.
NAIL.
AND FOLKS THIS CLOCK GOESBACK DECADES.
BACK IN 1995 HILLARY CLEARLYGAVE MONICA ONE OF HER
DEMOCRATIC PSYCHIC GAZESSECOND THE MESSAGE LOUD AND
CLEAR GIVE THE HUMMER TO MYHUSBAND IN THE OVAL OFFICE
SO THAT 19 YEARS LATER WECAN COMBINE FORCES TO
PUBLISH AN ARTICLE THAT WILLHELP MY PRESIDENTIAL
CHANCES.
IF I'VE SEEN IT ONCE, I'VESEEN IT A THOUSAND TIMES.
AND, AND I HAVE SEEN IT ONCE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> NEED MORE PROOF?
THEN YOU'RE WATCHING THEWRONG SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS IT FOR ANOTHEREDITION OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S
[BLEEP], TUNE IN NEXT TIMEWHEN I ASK HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WOULD BE DOING THISSEGMENT AGAIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
