I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION
FOR YOU HEROES.
DO YOU CONTINUE TO BE READY TO
ROCK?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD BECAUSE TONIGHT WE HAVE
GRIZZLY BEAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD, IS THE
ONLY BEARS I WOULD EVER HAVE ON
MY SHOW.
JUST THE SAME, PLEASE JUST THE
SAME PLEASE BAG ALL OF YOUR
TRASH AND HANG IT FROM A TREE
OTHERWISE THEY WILL RUMMAGE
THROUGH IT.
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE BEARS BUT
BECAUSE THEY'RE AN INDY BAND AND
IT'S A VERY TOUGH LIVING.
AND AS FOR EVERY-- EVERY--
COACHELLA FEST IS OUR D.J. GRAND
