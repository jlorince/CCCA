WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TOSEE YOU.
FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,IT'S NOT JUST THE ENERGY IN
THIS ROOM.
I FEEL IT TOO.
YOU KNOW, I LOVE GOING-- ILOVE GOING ON VACATION.
IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AFTERTWO WEEKS.
I SPENT THE FOURTH OF JULYHOLIDAY CELEBRATING A STEAMY
ANNIVERSARY WITH MY LOVER,AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER)I GOT HIM THE SAME PRESENT
AS EVERY YEAR, SCRAP MEATAND EXPLOSIVES.
BUT SADLY IT WASN'T ALLPARTY TIME.
YOU SEE, BEFORE VACATION IWAS SWEPT UP IN WORLD CUP
FEVER!
RIDING HIGH!
RIDING HIGH ON TEAM USA'STHRILLING SERIES OF WINNING,
TYING AND LOSING.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THEN WE FACED OUR
ETERNAL ENEMY, BELGIUM.
OR AS I CALL IT EUROPE RHODEISLAND.
(LAUGHTER)AND THOSE WAFFLE-SUCKING
SORT OF FRENCHIES.
CRUSHED US LIKE WE WERE THEMIN EVERY WORLD WAR.
(LAUGHTER)AND WITH AMERICA OUT OF THE
PICTURE IT ALL CAME DOWN TOA DEATH MATCH BETWEEN
GERMANY AND ARGENTINA.
NATURALLY I ASSUMED IT WOULDBE DECIDED BASED ON WHICH
COUNTRY HAS THE MOST LIVINGNAZI WAR CRIMINALS.
TOO CLOSE TO CALL.
SO INSTEAD-- (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS DECIDED WITH THETHRILLING SIGHT OF A CHEST
VOLLEY GOAL IN EXTRA TIMEFOLLOWED BY THE TERRIFYING
SIGHT OF GERMANS CELEBRATINGVICTORY.
'CAUSE THAT NEVER TURNS BAD.
OF COURSE THIS CUP FINAL HASSPECIAL MEANING IN VATICAN
CITY, BECAUSE POPE FRANCISIS FROM ARGENTINA AND
LIVE-IN GRAND POPE BENEDICTIS FROM GERMANY.
SO DEUTSCHELAND'S WIN MEANSBENEDICT IS POPE AGAIN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BYE-BYE FRANK.
DON'T LET THE 20 FOOT GUILDEDDOOR HIT YOU WHERE THE GOOD
LORD SPLIT YA.
