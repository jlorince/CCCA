(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE PRO PEACE,
PRO-ISRAEL LOBBY J STREET.
I FOUND HIM ON J DATE.
PLEASE WELCOME JEREMY
BENAMI.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, MR. BENAMI.
YOU ARE, AS I HAVE SAID, YOU
ARE THE PRESIDENT AND
FOUNDER OF J STREET.
YOU ALSO HAVE A BOOK CALLED
"A NEW VOICE FOR ISRAEL,
FIGHTING FOR THE SURVIVAL OF
THE JEWISH NATION"
OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT
IS HAPPENING AT THE U.N.
RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE THE PALESTINIANS
TRYING TO DO AND WHY ARE
THEY DOING IT?
>> PRESIDENT ABBAS IS GOING
TO GO BEFORE THE UNITED
NATIONS TOMORROW AND SUBMIT
AN APPLICATION TO BE A
MEMBER STATE AT THE UNITED
NATIONS.
>> Stephen: IS IT THAT
SIMPLE?
BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO
APPLY.
DO YOU JUST-- CAN YOU
DOWNLOAD IT,.
>> SOUTH DUD AN GOT
STATEHOOD IN 72 HOURS, SO
THE PALESTINIAN PROCESS IS
PROBABLY GOING TO BE A
LITTLE LONGER THAN THAT.
>> Stephen: WE CAN'T LET
THIS HAPPEN, RIGHT.
THE UNITED STATES CANNOT LET
THIS HAPPEN.
BECAUSE THE U.N. IS A
COMPLETELY WEAK, INEFFECTUAL
SHAM OF AN ORGANIZATION,
BUT --
>> BUT IF THIS VOTE GOES
THROUGH THE WORLD ENDS.
>> THE REASON WE'RE AGAINST
T I THINK, IS MORE THAT IF
THIS VOTE GOES THROUGH IT
DOESN'T REALLY HELP US TO
END THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE
ISRAELI AN PALESTINIAN
PEOPLES.
AND THAT'S THE GOAL.
>> Stephen: THAT MAKES IT
WORSE, RIGHT.
>> IT COULD MAKE IT WORSE.
IT WILL NOT MAKE THE WORLD
FOR MAHMOUD ABBAS OR HIS
PEOPLE BETTER WHEN HE FLIES
BACK AFTER THIS RESOLUTION.
>> Stephen: THEN WHY WOULD
HE DO IT?
IS THIS A STUNT?
>> THIS IS SYMBOLISM IT IS
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
SYMBOLISM BUT IT DOESN'T END
THIS DECADES-LONG CONFLICT.
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE
DANGER I SEE.
IS THERE IS SOME EQUIVALENCY
GOING ON HERE, YOU CAN DRAW
SOME SORT OF FALSE PARALLEL.
BECAUSE ISRAEL ITSELF WAS
CREATED BY A MANDATE FROM
THE U.N..
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT
ABBAS IS ASKING FOR?
ISN'T WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE
GOOSE GOOD FOR THE GANDER?
>> IF GOOSE IS KOSHER.
>> I WILL CHECK THAT WITH MY
RABBI.
>> Stephen: OKAY, PLEASE DO.
>> THE WAY THAT ISRAEL CAME
INTO BEING WAS A RESULT OF A
WAR.
THE U.N. REPARTITIONSED THE
MANDATE THAT THE BRITISH
WHAT IN 1947.
THEY SAID THIS LAND IS FOR
THE JEWS, THIS LAND IS FOR
THE ARABS.
BUT THERE WASN'T AN
AGREEMENT.
AND THEY ENDED UP AT WAR.
AND SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT
IF THERE IS A SIMILAR THING
THAT HAPPENS HERE WHERE THE
U.N. SAYS OKAY, WE'RE DONE.
HERE'S YOUR STATE AND THERE
ISN'T AGREEMENT, DOES THIS
SET THE STAGE FOR FURTHER
VIOLENCE.
WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU NEED AN
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PARTIES TO END THIS
CONFLICT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, LET'S TALK
ABOUT, LET'S TALK ABOUT J
PACT, YOU GUYS.
OKAY, I THOUGHT THERE WAS
ALREADY AN ISRAELI LOBBY,
A-PAC.
THE AMERICAN ISRAELI
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE,
THAT'S THE ISRAELI LOBBY.
WHO ARE YOU GUYS?
>> WE ARE THE OTHER ISRAEL
LOBBY.
>> Stephen: HOW CAN THERE BE
TWO LOBBIES.
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE
PRO-ISRAEL, LOVE IT OR LEAVE
IT, RIGHT?
IS THERE I-- YOU DON'T
QUESTION BEBENETANYAHU DO
YOU.
>> I DO.
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF JEWS IN
THE ROOM YOU WILL GET MANY
OPINIONS.
AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED
WITH J STREET IT WASN'T GOOD
ENOUGH TO HAVE JUST ONE
GROUP REPRESENTING THE
ENTIRE JEWISH COMMUNITY
BECAUSE WE DON'T ALL AGREE.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAY.
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GIVING ANY
LAND BACK?
>> WE DO.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I WILL SEE
YOU IN HELL.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
IF JEWS BELIEVED IN HELL.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW WHAT ABOUT DIVIDED
JERUSALEM.
>> WE BELIEVE THAT SHARED
JERUSALEM.
>> Stephen: SHARED JERUSALEM
THE WAY SALOMO NEGOTIATION
WANTED TO SHARE THE BABY.
>> ABOUT HALF-AND-HALF.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> CAPITAL FOR THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ON THE
EASTERN SIDE OF THE CITY
WHERE THE ARABS LIVE, AND A
CAPITOL ON THE WESTERN SIDE
FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHERE
THE JEWS LIVE AND IT WILL BE
THE CAPITAL OF TWO STATES
FOR TWO PEOPLE AND THAT IS
HOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET
PEACE AND SECURITY.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT WHAT
THE CHRISTIANS WANT HERE,
OKAY.
BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR THE
RAPTURE TO HAPPEN-- AS I
SAID BEFORE, ALL THE JEWS
HAVE TO BE IN GATHERED TO
ISRAEL AND THE TEMP EL HAS
TO BE REBUILT ON THE TEMP EL
MOUNT OR ELSE CHRIST DOESN'T
COME ON A CLOUD OF GLORY TO
JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE
DEAD.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN?
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT DOESN'T END WELL FOR
THE JEWS.
>> Stephen: MY FRIEND, MY
FRIEND, WHAT DOES.
(APPLAUSE)
>> WE ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO RESOLVE A
TERRITORY-- TERRITORY QAL
DISPUTE.
TWO PEOPLE WANT THEIR
HOMELAND ON THE SAMELAND.
IF IT BECOMES A RELIGIOUS
DISPUTE THERE'S PROBABLY NO
WAY TO SOLVE THIS.
IF WE CAN KEEP IT AS THE
NOTION THAT THIS IS TWO
LANDS, FOR TWO PEOPLE AND
THEY HAVE TO SHARE IT, SO
THEY STOP KILLING EACH OTHER,
THEN WE CAN MAKE SOME
PROGRESS.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU
THINK HAPPENS TOMORROW AFTER
ABBAS GIVES HIS SPEECH.
DOES THE U.N. GENERAL
ASSEMBLY GET TO VOTE ON IT.
>> IT MAY NOT COME FOR A
VOTE FOR MANY MONTHS.
IT GOES TO THE SECURITY
COUNCIL WHERE THERE MAY NOT
BE NINE VOTES.
HE NEEDS NINE VOTES TO
COMPANY OUT OF THE SECURITY
COUNCIL THERE MAY NOT EVEN
BE NINE VOTES THERE.
IT MAY TAKE MONTHS FOR IT TO
GO THROUGH COMMITTEEINGS AND
HEARINGS AND ALL THE
PROCESS.
TOMORROW IS NOT A BIG
CLIMACTIC DAY FOR THIS, IT
WILL BE KIND OF AN
ANTI-CLIMAX.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE OBAMA BECAUSE I
HAVE TO SAY HE DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THAT MUCH OF A FRIEND
TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL TO
ME.
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP THE
REPUBLICANS IF IT WERE TRUE.
I AM SAYING HE HASN'T
VISITED ISRAEL WHILE HE HAS
BEEN PRESIDENT.
HE WENT TO EGYPT BUT NOT
ISRAEL.
BUT HE WENT TO ISRAEL WHEN
HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
SO, SO, HE WILL DO THAT WHEN
HE NEEDS OUR VOTES.
BUT HE --
>> I WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR
THE PRESIDENT TO GO TO
ISRAEL.
BUT TRUE FRIENDSHIP FOR
ISRAEL AT THIS POINT IS
HELPING IT TO MAKE PEACE AND
HELPING IT TO END THIS
CONFLICT.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT SO SURE.
I'M NOT SO SURE.
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY, IS
THAT, YOU KNOW, CONSTANT
EXISTENTIAL CRIES SIS KIND
OF THE JEW'S THING.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE LIKE
TAKING JAZZ FROM BLACK
PEOPLE.
>> I THINK THERE IS MORE
THAN ENOUGH FOR JEWS TO
WORRY ABOUT IF WE CAN GET
THIS CONFLICT BEHIND US.
THERE IS AN ENTIRE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF PROBLEMS TO
WORRY ABOUT ONCE YOU GET
BEHIND THE
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN
CONFLICT.
I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL TO ISRAEL'S
SURVIVAL THAT IT IS GOING TO
BE JEWISH AND DEMOCRATIC, IT
HAS TO HAVE A STATE OF
PALESTINE LIVING
SIDE-BY-SIDE IN PEACE AND
SECURITY.
THE ONLY WAY THERE WILL BE A
JEWISH AN DEMOCRATIC ISRAEL.
>> Stephen: SIR, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
I WILL SEE YOU, IF NOT AGAIN
ON THE SHOW, I WILL SEE YOU
AT THE JUDGEMENT DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JEREMY BENAMI.
A NEW VOICE FOR ISRAEL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
