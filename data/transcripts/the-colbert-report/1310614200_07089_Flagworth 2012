[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WOO!
WOO!
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THAT KIND OF CHANTING MAKES ME
WANT TO SAY, YOU ARE THE MAN!
BUT --
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T WANT TO GET THAT WRONG.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, WE ALL KNOW THE GOP'S
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO MAKE
SURE OBAMA IS A ONE-TERM
PRESIDENT.
BUT I SAY, AIM HIGHER.
MAKE HIM A NO-TERM PRESIDENT.
LET'S BUILD A TIME MACHINE, GO
BACK TO THE 1970'S, AND CONVINCE
YOUNG BARACK TO GO INTO
DENTISTRY!
[LAUGHTER]
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD.
I WOULD HAVE TRUSTED HIM FOR
THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT ON THE SLIM CHANCE THAT MY
TIME MACHINE PLAN DOESN'T WORK,
THERE MAY BE ANOTHER WAY TO WIN.
REPUBLICANS HAVE AN EDGE IN
2012, THANKS TO A NEW STUDY OUT
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
WHICH FOUND THAT SEEING AN
AMERICAN FLAG CAN SHIFT VOTERS
TOWARDS REPUBLICANISM.
BEFORE THE 2008 ELECTION,
RESEARCHERS GAVE TWO GROUPS WITH
THE SAME POLITICAL BELIEFS
QUESTIONNAIRES ASKING WHO THEY
WERE GOING TO VOTE FOR:
OBAMA OR MCCAIN.
THE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE
IDENTICAL EXCEPT ONE GROUP'S
FORM HAD A SMALL AMERICAN FLAG
AND THE OTHER DID NOT.
AFTER THE ELECTION, RESEARCHERS
FOUND THAT THOSE WHO SAW THE
FLAG WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE
VOTED FOR OBAMA.
THAT MEANS MCCAIN COULD'VE WON,
IF ONLY HE'D SHOWN UP TO DEBATES
LIKE THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
THREW IT AWAY.
HE THREW THAT ONE AWAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS STUDY HAS ME THINKING.
WE MAY HAVE A NEW GOP
FRONTRUNNER -- THE HONORABLE
FRANKLIN F. FLAGWORTH.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS GUY'S GOT EVERYTHING.
HE'S A WAR HERO.
HE'S BEEN TO THE MOON.
WE KNOW HE WAS BORN IN AMERICA.
AND LIKE ALL GREAT PRESIDENTS,
HE HAS AN EMBARRASSING SOUTHERN
RELATIVE AND HE HAS HAD A SEX
SCANDAL.
[LAUGHTER]
IS THERE A BABY?
I'LL NEVER TELL.
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS, WHENEVER HE SHOWS UP, THE
OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE TO PLEDGE
TO HIM.
SURE, SOMETIMES HE GOES
WHICHEVER WAY THE WIND BLOWS,
BUT NOBODY WILL EVER QUESTION
HIS PATRIOTISM.
ONCE WE GIVE HIM A FLAG PIN.
