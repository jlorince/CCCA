[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CURRENTLY THE NUMBER-ONE RANKED CHESS PLAYER IN THE WORLD.
I'M GOING TO ASK HIM WHAT THE LITTLE HORSIE DOES.
PLEASE WELCOME MAGNUS CARLSEN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MAGNUS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
HONOR TO MEET YOU.
MAGNUS CARLSEN, WE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT, YOU AND I.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WE ARE BOTH GENIUSES, NUMBER ONE IN OUR FIELD AND BOTH VERY YOUNG.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I CAN SEE THAT.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE THE THIRD YOUNGEST GRAND MASTER OF ALL TIME.
AND YOU WERE THE YOUNGEST, AGE 19, THE YOUNGEST NUMBER-ONE RANKED CHESS PLAYER IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HOLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED PLAYING?
>> I WAS ABOUT EIGHT.
>> Stephen: EIGHT YEARS OLD.
AND BY THE TIME YOU WERE 13, YOU WERE A GRAND MASTER.
WHAT WAS THE AFFINITY YOU HAD FOR CHESS FROM THE BEGINNING?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST STARTED PLAYING, AND I...
WELL, I LIKED THE GAME, SO I STARTED STUDYING A LOT.
>> Stephen: BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THE GAME.
WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CHESSBOARD?
ARE YOU SEEING LIKE LITTLE WOODEN PIECES ON A BOARD, OR ARE YOU SEEING SOME SORT OF
FOURTH-DIMENSIONAL GAME?
DO THE PIECES TURN TO YOU AND SAY, "MOVE ME, MAGNUS?" DO YOU SEE THE BOARD DIFFERENTLY
THAN A NORMAL, AVERAGE,
NOT-GENIUS?
>> NOT REALLY.
I JUST SEE THE BOARD, THE PIECES, EVERYTHING, AND THEN OBVIOUSLY I THINK OF PATTERNS,
WHAT TO DO NEXT AND SO ON, BUT I MEAN, THE PIECES IN GENERAL,
THERE... THEY ARE JUST TOOLS FOR ME.
>> Stephen: SO THEY DON'T TALK TO YOU?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NOT TOO MUCH?
>> NOT TOO MUCH, NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT JUST A CHESS PLAYER.
YOU'VE ALSO DONE LATE BIT OF MODELING.
DO WE HAVE THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS HERE OF SOME OF THE MODELING THAT YOU'VE DONE?
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE UP HERE.
THAT IS... THAT IS... THAT MIGHT BE THE SEXIEST CHESS PLAYER I'VE EVER SEEN.
[APPLAUSE]
SO NOW IN EUROPE, IN EUROPE WHERE THEY LOVE THE CHESS,
YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, ESPECIALLY IN NORWAY.
>> Stephen: NORWAY.
YOU GOT TWO BIG SPORTS, CHESS AND, UH, UH SADNESS.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S AN INDOOR SPORT, CHESS.
DOES THAT HELP IN NORWAY SINCE YOU HAVE THE LONG WINTERS?
>> YEAH, PROBABLY.
I GUESS IN NORWAY WHEN IT'S COLD AND DARK OUTSIDE, PEOPLE NEED SOMETHING SORT OF...
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL MOVES?
DO YOU PSYCH OUT YOUR OPPONENT?
LIKE DO YOU GET UP AND WALK AROUND?
>> I DO SOMETIMES.
>> DOES THAT PSYCH OUT YOUR OPPONENT?
>> NO, IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE I'M BORED.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
YOU'RE SO GOOD THAT YOU'RE MOSTLY BORED IN COMPETITION.
WHEN YOU WIN, DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL MOVE?
DO YOU SPIKE THE BISHOP AND GO,
"HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?"
>> NO, NOT REALLY.
I JUST... I TRY TO BE RESPECTFUL TO MY OPPONENTS.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BOBBY FISHER?
HE WAS OUR GREAT CHAMPION.
HE WENT THE CRAZY IS.
THERE A FEAR THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN, THAT YOU THINK ABOUT CHESS TOO MUCH AND YOU WILL LOSE
YOUR MIND?
>> NO.
I MEAN...
>> Stephen: REALLY?
DO YOU LIKE FISHER?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME.
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO LIKE HIS CHESS... I MEAN, YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT ABOUT HIM AS A PERSON, BUT AS A CHESS PLAYER,
YOU KNOW, I CANNOT HELP BUT ADMIRE HIM GREATLY.
>>
>> Stephen: ANY TIME I HAVE A GUEST WHO IS A COMPETITOR, I DON'T LET THEM LEAVE THIS
BUILDING WITHOUT COMPETING WITH THEM.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: I'M A GRAND MASTER OF MY OWN.
I AM THE SECOND YOUNGEST GRAND MASTER OF ROCK PAPER SCISSORS OF ALL TIME.
WOULD YOU PLAY ME BEST 2 OUT OF 3?
>> OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BE CLEAR.
LET'S BE CLEAR.
IT'S ONE, TWO, THREE, SHOOT.
YOU DON'T SHOOT ON THREE, ONE,
TWO, THREE, AND THEN YOU SHOOT.
>> I DON'T HAVE TO SAY SHOOT,
RIGHT?
>> Stephen: I'LL SAY "SHOOT." READY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU STRATEGIZING?
BECAUSE I GOT A STRATEGY ALREADY.
I'M SEEING 20 STEPS AHEAD.
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE STEP.
>> FOR ME IT'S 100% RANDOM.
>> Stephen: SEE, YOU HAVE NO OPENING.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ONE, TWO, THREE, SHOOT.
ONE, TWO, THREE, SHOOT.
[BLEEPED] OKAY.
TWO OUT OF THREE.
TWO OUT OF THREE.
TWO OUT OF THREE.
READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE, SHOOT.
[BLEEPED]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MAGNUS CARLSEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THE NEW GRAND MASTER OF ROCK,
PAPER SCISSORS, MAGNUS CARLSEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
