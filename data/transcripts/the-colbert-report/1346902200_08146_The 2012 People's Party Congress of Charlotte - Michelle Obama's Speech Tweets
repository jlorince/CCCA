BUT ULTIMATELY, THE TRUE MEASURE OF LAST NIGHT WAS NOT THE VOLUME OF THE CROWD OR HOW DEEPLY
PEOPLE WERE MOVED.
NO, IT WAS THE TWITTERING.
YES, THE THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE SHOOK THE RAFTERS, BUT WHAT DID HORNYHAM BERGER69 TWEET TO HIS BROS?
FORTUNATELY WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA THE NEWS MEDIA HAVE THEIR CYBER FINGERS ON THE INFO
NET YOUTH PULSE.
POKE ME, JIM.
>> OUR TWEETS PER MINUTE CONVENTION HALL OF FAME IT WAS MICHELLE OBAMA WHO IS SETTING A
RECORD WITH 28,000 TWEETS PER MINUTE.
>> SOMETHING LIKE 28,000 TWEETS PER MINUTE AT A SPEECH COMPARED
TO MITT ROMNEY'S PEAK AT 14,000.
>> WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT HARD WORK AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HARD WORK, 18,669.
THEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM AND HOW HER HUSBAND LIVED THAT OUT IN HIS LIFE.
BOOM, 21,577.
WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT FOUR MORE YEARS, 22,004, HUGE, HUGE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE NOT USED TO SEEING.
>> Stephen: YES, BOOM!
I HAVE NEVER SEEN NUMBERS LIKE THAT!
(LAUGHTER) 22,004.
THAT NUMBER IS HUGE!
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO OTHER NUMBERS THAT ARE SMALLER.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS IS THE GREATEST NUMBER RELATED REPORTING SINCE CRONKITE BROKE THE HORRIFIC
CANNIBAL STORY THE 789.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A SAD STORY.
MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HARD FOR HIM TO HOLD IT TOGETHER THERE.
NOW, GIVEN THESE UNPRECEDENTED TWEET NUMBERS, WHAT DO THEY MEAN?
ARE THEY GOOD OR BAD?
FOR MORE WE GO TO SOMEONE ELSE.
>> ACCORDING TO TWITTER, HE SPEECH PEAKED AT 28,000 TWEETS PER MINUTE.
NOW, IT DOESN'T MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE POSITIVE TWEETS OR NEGATIVE REMARKS.
JUST INTERESTING NUMBERS REALLY,
THOUGH.
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY MEAN.
>> Stephen: WHO KNOWS?
(LAUGHTER) WHO CARES?
POINT IS, THESE NUMBERS ARE OUT THERE AND IT'S THE MEDIA'S DUTY TO REPORT THEM!
WITHOUT THE LIBERAL FILTER OF MEANING SOMETHING.
WELL, I AM ALWAYS ON THE BLEEDING EDGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA SO I SPENT ALL NIGHT WATCHING MY
WEB METERS-- LITERALLY THIS.
I DID THIS WITH MY ARMS ALL NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) AND WHAT I FOUND WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.
THAT'S NOT ONE SOCK, BUT TWO SOCKS!
FOR MORE, LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE INTERNET NUMBO-TRON 3000.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME.
WELCOME TO THE NUMBO-TRON 3000 WHERE A-SQUARED PLUS B-SQUARED EQUALS ME-SQUARED.
(LAUGHTER) LET ME JUST HACK INTO THE MAINFRAME HERE.
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF NUMBERS TO CRUNCH RIGHT OFF THE TOP.
FIVE.
YOU KNOW THE OBAMA TEAM HAS GOT TO BE WATCHING THAT BUT HANG ON THAT'S A NINE.
(LAUGHTER) TOTALLY DIFFERENT INTEGER, I DO NOT SEE THAT COMING.
NOW LET'S COMPARE THAT WITH LAST WEEK'S NUMBERS, 14 AND 3.
SO OBVIOUSLY TOES HAVE CHANGED.
ONE IS HIGHER, SOMEONE LOWER,
NOT SURE WHICH, I'M JUST EYEBALLING THIS AT THIS POINT.
NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS.
OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE TALKING INTERNET COMMUNAL LINKS, THESE DAYS RIGHT NOW YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT CLOUD COMPUTING.
OKAY, THERE'S THE CLOUD.
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST A METAPHOR.
THE ACTUAL CLOUD MUCH LARGER AND IN THE SKY.
OKAY.
(LAUGHTER) LET'S CHECK OUT TONIGHT'S BIG NUMBER.
OKAY.
11,394.5.
HOLY (BLEEP)!
THAT'S A DECIMAL!
APPLAUSE) WHO KNOWS?
WHO KNOWS?
WHO KNOWS WHAT IT COULD MEAN?
THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE AT THE CONVENTION, MY BAR BILL, THE HEIGHT OF EVERYONE IN CHARLOTTE
ADDED TOGETHER THEN DIVIDED BY FIVE, WE WILL HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE ON THIS.
OUR TOP MINDS, CHINESE GUYS, THE WHOLE DEAL.
I PROMISE YOU MORE ON THIS NUMBER AS I HAVE TO FILL TIME.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT
