WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, I WAS GOING TO WAIT TO REPORT ON THIS NEXT STORY TOMORROW, BUT THERE MAY NOT BE A TOMORROW.
BECAUSE THIS THREAT COMES FROM THE ACTIS OF EVIL, WHICH IS JUST AS EVIL AND AS AXISY AS EVER.
BUT TONIGHT IT'S NOT IRAQ OR NORTH KOREA.
TONIGHT EVIL COMES FROM...
[BEEPING SEQUENCE]
... IRAN.
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
JIM?
>> THE POSSIBILITY OF YET ANOTHER BLOODY BATTLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THIS TIME AGAINST IRAN.
>> COULD THERE BE ANOTHER WAR WITH IRAN?
>> IRAN HAS BEEN FUNDING PROXY WARS NOW AGAINST OUR OWN MILITARY.
I THINK THE WAR'S ALREADY STARTED.
IT'S PERCOLATING.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, A WAR WITH IRAN IS ALREADY PERCOLATING.
AND MUCH LIKE COFFEE, YOU WILL BE HOT, OVERPRICED AND KEEP US UP AT NIGHT.
AT ISSUE, FOLKS, IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH EXPERTS SAY IS JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM BEING JUST
YEARS AWAY FROM BUILDING A BOMB.
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HAS SAID WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN,
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE,
EXCEPT THE TABLE OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
SO WE MIGHT BE GOING TO WAR.
UNLIKE EVERY OTHER WAR WE HAVE FOUGHT, THIS ONE MIGHT GET COMPLICATED.
BECAUSE LAST WEEK IRAN HELD PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND THE ATLANTIC MAGAZINE POSTED THIS
PHOTO OF A VOTER WEARING A TOBY KEITH AMERICAN FLAG T-SHIRT WITH
THE WORDS "GOD BLESS AMERICA." NOW, FOLKS, THIS T-SHIRT PRESENTS TWO DANGEROUS SCENARIOS.
ONE, WHAT IF THAT GUY DOES LOVE AMERICA AND TOBY KEITH?
[LAUGHTER]
KNOWING THAT MIGHT PREVENT US FROM PUTTING A BOOT UP HIS ASS.
WOULD WE HAVE EVER STORMED THE BEACHES AT NORMANDY IF WE SAW HITLER WEARING A GLENN MILLER
CHATTANOOGA CHO-CHOO T-SHIRT.
AND HERE'S A SECOND DANGER OF THE TWO DANGERS I JUST MENTIONED MOMENTS AGO, DANGER TWO, THIS
GUY MIGHT NOT LOVE AMERICA.
HE COULD JUST BE A HIPSTER WEARING THAT T-SHIRT IRONICALLY.
AFTER ALL, THAT'S WHERE IREY COMES FROM, IRAN.
HE'S TURNING THIS INTO A FARCE IN FARSI.
IT WAS ALREADY BAD ENOUGH THAT IRAN WAS HIDING THEIR NUCLEAR INTENTIONS UNDER GROUND.
NOW THEY COULD BE HIDING UNDER A THICK LAYER OF SARCASM.
AND THE REAL THREAT IS, FOLKS,
OUR HIPSTERS COULD FORM A SECRET ALLIANCE WITH THEIR HIPSTERS.
>> OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
>>
>> Stephen: OH, GOOD, GOOD,
IT'S OUR HIPSTER AUDIENCE MEMBER.
HIPSTER, I NEED TO KNOW, WILL YOU HIPSTERS FORM A SECRET ALLIANCE WITH IRAN?
>> YEAH, WE'RE TOTALLY GOING TO DO THAT.
>> SO YOU ARE?
>> SURE.
DOWN WITH THE GREAT SATAN.
THIS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT.
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE DIRECT.
>> WELL, I GUESS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH TRUSTING PEOPLE,
STEPHEN, SO I USE SARCASM TO MASK MY OWN INSECURITIES.
>> OH.
[LAUGHTER]
REALLY?
>> YEAH, I'M TOTALLY INSECURE.
WHATEVER.
NOW IF YOU'LL GO EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO WIPE ISRAEL OFF THE MAP.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO DO THAT?
>> UM, I'M WEARING THE TESTIMONY SHIRT, SO...
>> Stephen: OKAY, ISRAEL, THE THREAT IS REAL.
FROM NOW ON YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT SUICIDE VESTS, IT'S GOING TO BE SUICIDE SKINNY
