I'LL BE WHOEVER YOU WANT ME TO
BE.
NATION, YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT A
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AFTER RUMORS
SURFACED THAT NFL LEGEND BRETT
FAVRE WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE AGAIN,
I BID HIM A FOND FAREWELL.
JAMES.
YOU WILL BE MISSED.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
DUE TO YOUR PERMANENT ABSENCE
FROM FOOTBALL.
BUT IF YOU DO UNRETIRE AGAIN,
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY, I
WILL STAB YOU IN THE EYEBALL
WITH A BROKEN BROOM HANDLE.
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
>> IT'S OFFICIAL, BRETT FAVRE
WILL PLAY IN HIS 20th NFL
SEASON.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT VIDEO OF HIS
FIRST PRACTICE TODAY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: IT'S EYE KEBAB
TIME, FAVRE.
FAVRE'S ON AGAIN-OFF AGAIN
AFFAIR WITH HIS HAMMOCK IS OFF
AGAIN.
AND WHY?
>> IT'S ABOUT THESE GUYS.
IT REALLY IS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, IT'S ALL
ABOUT THESE GUY, SPECIFICALLY
THESE GUYS.
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?
AND WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH
YOUR FAMILY?
EVERY TIME YOU SPEND TEN MINUTES
WITH THEM YOU SUDDENLY DECIDE
THAT YOU'D RATHER BE CRUSHED BY
300-POUND LINEBACKERS.
NOW, I GET IT.
I GET IT.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I KNOW.
RETIREMENT MAKES YOU EMOTIONAL.
>> I HOPE THAT EVERY PENNY THAT
THEY'VE SPENT ON ME THEY KNOW
WAS MONEY WELL SPENT.
I, UH... IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE
MONEY OF FAME OR RECORDS.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU NEED
ALL THIS ATTENTION?
EVERY TIME YOU DO THIS, YOU GET
TONS AND TONS OF AIR TIME.
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU.
THE MEDIA IS FAWNING ALL OVER
YOU.
IT'S JUST --
[LAUGHTER]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS WITH
A HEAVY HEART THAT I ANNOUNCE MY
RETIREMENT FROM "THE COLBERT
REPORT."
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
[APPLAUSE]
[AUDIENCE BOOS]
I KNOW IT'S A SHOCKER THAT WITH
ANY LUCK WILL MAKE FRONT-PAGE
HEADLINES ANYWHERE.
[VOICE CRACKING]
AND I JUST WANT THE NETWORK TO
KNOW THAT I HOPE EVERY PENNY
THEY SPENT ON ME WAS ACTUALLY A
DIME.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE MONEY OR
THE FAME OF THE RECORDS.
IT WAS ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS
TOGETHER.
[LAUGHTER]
WOW.
THAT WAS TOUGH.
BUT NOT AS TOUGH AS THIS NEXT
MOMENT.
NATION, AFTER MUCH
CONSIDERATION, I'VE DECIDED TO
RETURN TO "THE COLBERT REPORT"
FOR THE COMING SEASON.
WOO!
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS OUT, I
PULLED ME BACK IN.
HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR WE CAN GO
ALL THE WAY.
OR I WILL GOUGE THE
