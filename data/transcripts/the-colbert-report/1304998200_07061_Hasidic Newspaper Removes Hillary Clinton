>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THANK YOU.
FOR A SECOND THERE I WASN'T
SURE IF THAT WAS GOING TO
COALESCE INTO A SNOWBALL.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I HOPE EVERYBODY HAD A GOOD
MOTHER'S DAY.
I CELEBRATED AS I CAUSE DO
IN THE FETAL POSITION.
BUT FOLKS THERE IS NO TIME
TO WASTE.
LET'S GO TO TONIGHT'S
BREAKING NEWS ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED EIGHT DAYS AGO.
OSAMA BIN LADEN CONTINUES
HIS CROWD-PLEASING DEATH.
ALL THE NEWSPAPERS ARE
COVERING IT FROM "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" TO THE DAILY
NEWS TO THE "NEW YORK POST".
BUT FOLKS, THAT'S JUST NEW
YORK.
THEY ARE ALSO COVERING IT IN
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
LIKE BROOKLYN.
(LAUGHTER)
I WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED
BY THE COVERAGE IN DER
TZITUNG, BROOKLYN'S HASIDIC
NEWSPAPER OF RECORD, JIM?
>> NOW YOU SEE HER, NOW YOU
DON'T.
IN A HASIDIC PAPER IN NEW
YORK THEY RAN THIS WHITE
HOUSE PICTURE IN THE
SITUATION ROOM PHOTO FROM
THE BIN LADEN RAID.
THERE IS ONE PROBLEM.
IT REMOVED HILLARY CLINTON.
>> Stephen: IMPRESSIVE.
NORMALLY GETTING RID OF

BECAUSE IT COULD BE
CONSIDERED SEXUALLY

(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I AM WITH THE HASIES
ON THIS ONE.
THERE IS NOTHING MORE
SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE THAN A
WOMAN KILLING A TERRORIST.
IN FACT, AT MY BACHELOR
PARTY A MARGARET THATCHER
IMPERSONATOR IN A PANT SUIT
CLUBBED AN EYE FOLLOWA
KHOMENI LOOK ALIKE TO DEATH.
SO DON'T TELL MY WIFE.
SHE THINKS I WAS AT A STRIP
CLUB.
SO THE TZITUNG ONLY HAD TWO
OPTIONS.
EITHER TAKE HER OUT OF THE
PHOTO OR HIDE THE FACT THAT
SHE'S A WOMAN.
PRINCIPLES, BY MAKING HER
HAND BIGGER.
OF COURSE.
OF TZITUNG'S POLICY OF
REMOVING WOMEN FROM
PHOTOGRAPHS IS NOT WITHOUT
ITS COMPLICATIONS.
BACK IN THE 70s WHEN GOLDA
MEIR WAS PRIME MINISTER OF
ISRAEL THE READERS ASSUMED
THE COUNTRY WAS BEING RUN BY
A HEADSTRONG PODIUM.
AND THINK HOW HARD THIS IS
ON TEENAGE HASIDIC BOYS.
ANY EMPTY SPOT IN A PHOTO
COULD BE A WOMAN.
MOST BOYS HIDE THE VICTORIA
SECRET CATALOG UNDER THEIR
BEDS BUT I'M SURE TEENAGER
TZITUNG READERS PREFER
ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.
THOSE SUMPUOUS INTERIORS
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO THE
