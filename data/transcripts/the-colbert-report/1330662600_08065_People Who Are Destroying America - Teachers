LET'S FACE IT, THE SECOND
YOUR KIDS WALK OUT THE DOOR
TO SCHOOL, YOU HAVE NO WAY
OF KNOWING THAT THEY'RE NOT
OFF VODKA EYEBALLING AT A
RAINBOW PARTY PLAYING THE
CHOKING GAME TO GET A DARE
BRACELET.
(LAUGHTER)
DON'T KNOW WHAT A DARE
BRACELET IS?
ASK YOUR KIDS.
THEY'LL CLAIM I JUST MADE IT

(LAUGHTER)
WELL W SO MANY THREATS TO
YOUR CHILD'S INNOCENCE,

I JUST FOUND ANOTHER ONE.
TEACHERS.
TONIGHT WE PROFILE ONE OF
THESE PEOPLE DESTROYING
AMERICA.
>> TONIGHT ON A VERY SPECIAL
PEOPLE DESTROYING AMERICA,
THIS IS THE TOWN OF PACE,
FLORIDA.
AND THESE ARE THE CHILDREN
OF PACE.
THEIR INNOCENCE LOST AT THE
HANDS OF THEIR OWN TEACHER.
A TEACHER WHO CROSSED THE
LINE AND BETRAYED THEIR
TRUST, DAWN QUARRELS WHO
LURED THEM INTO COMMITTING
AN UNSPEAKABLE ACT THEY WERE
TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND.
>> I AM BEING FINED BY THE
STATE 6 FLORIDA FOR
REGISTERING KIDS TO VOTE.
>> SOME AS YOUNG AS 17, AND
SO IMPRESSIONABLE.
>> YEAH, I THINK SHE MAKES
VOTING PRETTY COOL.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE
DAWN CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
>> I LOVE VOTING.
AND I TELL MY KIDS THAT YOU
ARE GOING TO LOVE THE
FEELING OF CASTING A BALLOT.
>> Stephen: SURE, WE ADULTS
LOVE IT BUT THESE ARE
FEELING KIDS JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PROCESS.
>> WE WERE ON A LEARNING
BUILD RIGHTS IN VOTING.
>> WE GOT IN THE ROOM.
SHE SAID I WHAT LIKE TO
REGISTER YOU TO VOTE TODAY
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO.
>> IF YOU WANT TO REGISTER
FOR IT JUST SIGN IT, FILL IT
OUT.
>> I GAVE IT BACK TO HER FOR
HER TO TURN INTO THE OFFICE
OF ELECTIONS.
>> SHE REGISTERED ME TO VET.
>> SHE REGISTERED ME TO
VOTE.
>> MISS QUARRELS REGISTERED
ME TO VOTE.
>> I DID IT WHEN EVERYONE
ELSE DID IT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHEN
AUTHORITIES MOVED IN WITH
LIGHTNING SPEED.
>> A MONTH AND A HALF AFTER
THAT I RECEIVED WORD THAT I
WAS BEING CITED BY THE STATE
OF FLORIDA.
>> Stephen: BUSTED, AND
CHARGED WITH.
>> VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD.
>> Stephen: A SERIOUS CRIME
THAT COMES WITH A $1,000
FINE UNDER A NEW FLORIDA
LAW.
>> GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT
SIGNED A SWEEPING ELECTION
REFORM LAW THIS WEEK.
SUPPORTERS SAY THE LAW WILL
PREVENT FRAUD BUT-- .
>> Stephen: BUT NOTHING T IS
DESIGNED TO CATCH FRAUDSTARS
IN THE FACT.
DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN
CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION AND
CASUAL MAN HOWARD EXPLAINS
HOW.
>> IT INDICATES THAT PEOPLE
WENT OUT AND REGISTERED NEW
VOTERS, COULD TURN IN THE
NEW VOTER REGISTRATIONS
WITHIN TEN DAYS.
NOW THE LEGISLATURE BROUGHT
IT DOWN TO 48 HOURS.
>> I DID NOT MAKE IT WITHIN
THE 48 HOURS.
>> Stephen: FRAUD.
>> I DID NOT-- .
>> Stephen: FRAUD, FRAUD,
FRAUD.
>> THERE IS NO VOTER FRAUD.
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A
PERSON WALKING AROUND THE
STREETS OF FLORIDA THAT
BELIEVES THAT THE VOTER
SUPPRESSION LAW OF 2011 IS
ABOUT VOTER FRAUD.
>> Stephen: WELL, HERE'S A
PERSON WALKING AROUND THE
STREETS OF FLORIDA.
WHAT DOES HE BELIEVE.
>> I THINK THIS LAW WILL
HELP INSURANCE THAT WE DON'T
HAVE VOTER FRAUD.
>> Stephen: DONE.
STATE REPRESENTATIVE RICH
DOLLAR CROSSO IS ONE OF 9
BRAVE LAWMAKERS WHO CAME OUT
OF THE SHADOWS TO SUPPORT
THIS ANTI-FRAUD BILL.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
>> IF YOU ARE-- SOMEBODY
BREAKS INTO YOUR CAR AND
STEALS YOUR STUFF BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T LOCK YOUR CAR,
WELL THEN DOW LOCK IT LATER
ON OR YOU HAVE LOCKED YOUR
CAR TODAY.
>> Stephen: SEE, IT'S
SIMPLE.
THE CAR IS THE VOTING BOOTH.
THE LOCK IS THE LAW.
YOUR STUFF IS THE BALLOT,
AND THE THIEF IS THE-- HOLD
ON, WAIT A MINUTE-- NO,
OKAY.
THE LOCK IS THE LAW, THE CAR
IS THE BALLOT-- WAIT, NO,
STOP, STOP, NO.
THE CAR IS THE LAW.
THE BOOTH IS THE BALLOT,
YOUR STUFF IS THE THIEF, AND
AND-- OKAY.
FRAUD.
HOWEVER IT WORKS, THE LAW
PREVENTS THE STUDENTS FROM
VOTE-- LIKE DAWN QUARRELS.
>> THIS LAW USES THE THREAT
OF FRAUD TO BASICALLY TRY TO
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR
BLACK PEOPLE AND COLLEGE
STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE
AND LANGUAGE MINORITIES FROM
VOTING.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD THEY
WANT TO DO THAT.
>> THEY TEND TO VOTE
DEMOCRATIC AND THEY VOTED
OVERWHELMINGLY FOR PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
>> Stephen: FRAUD!
>> AND I THINK WE CAN ALL
AGREE, FRAUD SOUNDS BAD.
>> FRAUD SOUNDS HORRIBLE.
>> FRAUD SOUNDS LIKE
STEALING AN ELECTION.
>> FRAUD SOUNDS CRIMINAL.
>> IF THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE
OF FRAUD.
>> Stephen: WANT EF?
-- EVIDENCE?
ACCORD TOGETHER BRENNAN
CENTER FOR JUSTICE VOTER
FRAUD DOES HAPPEN.
POINT 00004% OF THE TIME.
>> THERE ARE PROBABLY A
LARGER NUMBER OF SHARK
ATTACKS IN FLORIDA THAN
THERE ARE CASES OF VOTER
FRAUD.
>> Stephen: MEANING THIS IS
WHAT DAWN QUARRELS WANTS FOR
YOUR CHILDREN.
NEED MORE PROOF?
RICH GLORIOSO HAS THE HARD
NUMBERS.
>> RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW
THE NUMBERS BUT I KNOW THERE
ARE SOME CASES.
>> Stephen: GOOD ENOUGH.
>> BUT WE DECIDED THAT THIS
WILL HELP US PREVENT FRAUD.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
>> PREVENTING FRAUD IS KIND
OF LIKE WHETHER YOU LOCK
YOUR CAR OR NOT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT,
THE CAR THING, GOT IT.
THESE INNOCENT CHILDREN
DESERVE A CHANCE TO VOTE
WHEN THEY'RE READY.
AT THE RIGHT TIME, AND FOR
THE RIGHT CANDIDATE.
NOT FOR SOME CHEAP THRILL.
>> IF YOU WRITE IF OR PUNCH
IT WILL JUST BE CALL BECAUSE
YOU ARE LIKE I HAVE A SAY.
>> YES.
>> DONE.
I PUNCHED THE HOLE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU REALLY
WANT YOUR CHILD TO PUNCH THE
HOLE BEFORE THEY'RE READY.
>> KID, IF YOU START THEM
OUT YOUNG THEY WILL VOTE FOR
THE REST OF THEIR LIFE.
THEY WILL BE SUPERVOTERS BY
THE TIME THEY ARE IN THEIR
40s.
>> Stephen: IF THEY LIVE
THAT LONG.
>> HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN HELEN.
>> THE LAST TIME I SAW HER
SHE WAS VOTING.
>> OH.
>> Stephen: THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO STOP THIS FROM
HAPPENING TO YOUR KIDS.
>> I LOCKED MY CAR IN THE
PARKING LOT TODAY.
>> Stephen: YES, LOCK YOUR
CAR, AMERICA.
AND LOCK YOUR KIDS.
BECAUSE DAWN QUARRELS IS
INSATIABLE.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO STOP
REGISTERING KIDS TO VOTE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY SHE
IS THE PEOPLE DESTROYING
AMERICA.
REMEMBER, GIRLS-- YES, GO
AHEAD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: GO AHEAD.
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED BUT
IT'S SAFE TO APPLAUD IN
HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
REMEMBER, GIRLS, IF IT GETS
AROUND THAT YOU VOTED, NO
BOY IS GOING TO WANT TO VOTE
WITH YOU.
SO WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE MARRIED
AND THEN VOTE THE WAY YOUR
HUSBAND TELLS YOU
