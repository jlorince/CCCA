EVERYBODY!
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THECO-FOUNDER OF TWITTER!

PLEASE WELCOME BIZ STONE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(MUSIC)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH!
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
>> WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: AS THE PEOPLE, I'MSURE KNOW, YOU'RE THE
CO-INVENTER AND CO-FOUNDER OFTWITTER WHICH NOW HAS OVER
230 MILLION ACTIVE USERS.
YOU HAVE BEEN NAMED ONE OF "TIMEMAGAZINE'S" MOST INFLUENTIAL
PEOPLE, ENTREPRENEUR OF THEDECADE BY INK MAGAZINE, AND HAVE
A BOOK THINGS A LITTLE BIRD TOLDME: CONFESSIONS OF A CREATIVE
MIND.
WHAT DID THE BIRD TELL YOU?
THAT'S SOMETIMES A SIGN OFSCHIZOPHRENIA.
WHAT IS A CREATIVE MIND?
>> THIS IS A BOOK I STARTED TENYEARS AGO AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
>> Stephen: WOO WHOO!
OXFORD UNIVERSITY, SMARTY PANTS!
GO AHEAD.
>> I STARTED GIVING THIS LECTUREAND I STARTED GETTING INVITED TO
DO IT LOTS OF OTHER PLACES, ANDI FOUND THAT IT RESONATED WITH
PEOPLE -- KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOLALL THE WAY TO CEOs.
THEY WOULD COME UP AFTERWARDSAND SAY, YOU KNOW, THIS PART OF
THE LECTURE REALLY GAVE ME A NEWPERSPECTIVE ON THIS OR THAT.
SO WHEN SOMEONE SUGGESTED IWRITE A BOOK, I THOUGHT IT WAS A
GOOD IDEA.
>> Stephen: I WILL SAY, NOT ASINGLE CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK IS
LESS THAN 140 CHARACTERS LONG.
YOU, SIR, ARE A HYPOCRITE(LAUGHTER)
YOU STARTED A NEW APP CALLEDJELLY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT BRINGS PEOPLETOGETHER TO DO WHAT?
>> IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, NO ONEHAS REALLY COMPLETELY REIMAGINED
THE WAY THAT WE GET ANSWERS TOOUR QUESTIONS.
WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH DOINGIT THE SAME WAY, AND WE REALIZED
IT, AND TODAY'S MEDIA LANDSCAPEIS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
IT'S ALL MOBILE AND SOCIAL, IT'SA DIFFERENT BALL GAME.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES ITACTUALLY DO?
HOW WILL THIS NEW APP BE USED TOTRY TO GET ME FIRED?
(LAUGHTER)>> WE DESIGNED A BETTER WAY TO
ASK A QUESTION.
>> Stephen: SHOUT IT?
NO, NO.
IN FACT, THERE'S MORECHARACTERS, FIRST OF ALL, AND
YOU CAN USE PICTURES, YOU CANUSE MAPS, AND THE QUESTIONS GO
OUT TO REAL PEOPLE IN ALL OFYOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS.
FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWQUESTIONS.
HAVE YOU HEARD THE STRENGTH OFWEAK TIES?
>> Stephen: NO.
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ALL KINDOF KNOW THE SAME STUFF.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS HAS ALAWYER, AND HE'S AN
ACQUAINTANCE, AND HIS CIRCLE OFFRIENDS KNOWS A BUNCH OF OTHER
STUFF.
>> Stephen: AND IS HE GOING TOCHARGE ME BY THE HOUR?
>> NO, THE APP IS FREE ANDAVAILABLE NOW FOR BOTH IOS AND
ANDROID.
SO THAT ACQUAINTANCE JUMPS YOURQUESTION INTO A WHOLE NEW GROUP
OF PEOPLE.
SO FOR ANY QUESTION, THERE'S APERSON OUT THERE WHO HAS THE
EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, THEANSWER FOR YOU.
SO YOU SHOULD REALLY DOWNLOAD ITIF I DIDN'T WANT TO READ
YOUR BOOK, COULD I FIND SOMEONEON JELLY TO TELL ME WHAT IT'S
ABOUT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
OR USE IT TO FIND OUT WHERE TOBUY IT.
BIZ STONE, THINGS A LITTLE BIRDTOLD ME.
THANK YOU, BIZ.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK!
