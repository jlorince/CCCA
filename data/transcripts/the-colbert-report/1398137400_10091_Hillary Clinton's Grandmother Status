NATION, I DON'T MEAN TOALARM YOU BUT HILLARY
CLINTON CONTINUE ITS TOEXIST.
(LAUGHTER)SHE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO
REPUBLICANS IN 2016 OTHERTHAN REPUBLICANS IN 2014.
(LAUGHTER)AND SHE HAS JUST BECOME MORE
THREATENING.
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATINGAN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT
HILLARY CLINTON'S FUTURE.
AND TODAY WE GOT ONE.
SHE'S GOING TO BE AGRANDMOTHER.
>> Stephen: NOW OBVIOUSLYNEWS OF A GRANDCHILD IS A
JOYOUS OCCASION.
SOW I JUST WANT TO TAKE AMOMENT RIGHT NOW TO PUT
POLITICS ASIDEAND OFFER THE CLINTON FAMILY
A HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONSFOR SUCH A SHREWD POLITICAL
MOVE.
(LAUGHTER)RIGHT?
RIGHT, FOX NEWS?
>> I THINK A LOT OF THISMAYBE THIS WAS PLANNED.
>> Stephen: YES.
MAYBE THIS WAS PLANNED.
AND WE ALL KNOW ONLY THEMOST DEVIOUS PEOPLE WOULD
EVER PLAN A PREGNANCY.
(LAUGHTER)CLEAR, CLEARLY, FOLKS,
HILLARY CLINTON HASENGINEERED THE BIRTH OF HER
FIRST GRANDCHILD IN A CRAVENPOLITICAL PLOY TO SEEM
ENDEARING.
I MEAN NOT EVEN BARACK OBAMAEVER STOOPED TO BECOMING A
GRANDMOTHER.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S SO OBVIOUS, BILL AND
HILLARY CLEARLY SAT DOWN WITH THEIR DAUGHTER AND
SYNCED CHELSEA'S OVULATIONCYCLE WITH HILLARY'S POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN CALENDAR.
THERE IS NO OTHER MOTIVATIONFOR A COUPLE IN THEIR 60s TO
WANT THEIR DAUGHTER TO GIVETHEM A GRANDCHILD.
(LAUGHTER)BUT SOME NA-NA NAYSAYERS SAY
NAY NAY.
>> DON'T YOU THINK THAT THEYARE ENTITLED TO TRY TO HAVE
A BABY WHENEVER THEY WANT.
AND BY THE WAY, IF IT WASGOING TO BE PLANNED IT WOULD
BE PLANNED FOR NEXT YEARWHEN THE CAMPAIGN MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE UNDER WAY.
>> Stephen: GOOD POINT,HOWIE.
IF IT WAS PLANNED, THE CHILDWOULD BE BORN AROUND THE
IOWA CAUCUSES.
I MEAN WHAT A WASTE OF APERFECTLY GOOD PREGNANCY.
SO THAT'S NOT THE ONLY BIGNEWS TO COME OUT OF HILLARY'S
STILL MULLING OVER WHETHERTHIS IS A CAMPAIGN.
LAST WEEK SHE WAS VICIOUSLYATTACKED.
>> BETWEEN SECRETARY OFSTATE AND THE POSSIBLE RUN
FOR PRESIDENT, HILLARYCLINTON FOUND HERSELF UNDER
FIRE AS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKERAT THE LAS VEGAS CONVENTION
OF THE SCRAP RECYCLINGINDUSTRY.
>> IT'S ALREADY RECYCLING.
>> A WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCETHREW A SHOE AS CLINTON WAS
SPEAKINGYESTERDAY.
FORTUNATELY HER AIM WASN'TVERY GOOD.
>> WHAT WAS THAT, A BAT.
WAS THAT A BAT?
IS THAT SOMEBODY THROWINGSOMETHING AT ME?
IS THAT PART OF CIRQUE DUSOLEIL?
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: NO, NO SECRETARY
CLINTON IF IT WAS PART OFCIRQUE DU SOLEIL THE SHOE
WOULD HAVE PERFORMED ATWO-HOUR DREAM OPERA.
AND THEN CHARGED YOU $200 ATICKET.
(LAUGHTER)NOW FOLKS, I DO NOT TRUST
HILLARY CLINTON.
AND THERE'S A TON OF PERSONWHO AGREE WITH ME.
>> WE HAD A CALL YESTERDAYAND BASICALLY THIS WOMAN'S
THEORY IS THAT MRS. CLINTONSTAGED THE WHOLE INCIDENT
WHERE SOMEBODY THREW A SHOEAT HER.
THE CLINTON WILL WELL-KNOWNFOR STAGING THINGS.
DO THE CLINTON STAGE THINGS?
HECK YES, THEY STAGE THINGS.
THEREFORE IS IT OUTRAGEOUSTHAT SOMEBODY WOULD CALL
HERE AND THINK MAYBE HILLARYSTAGED THE SHOE
THROWING-- NO, IT ISN'TOUTRAGEOUS.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE ITCOULD HAVE BEEN STAGED.
I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT, SHEWAS STANDING ON A STAGE.
