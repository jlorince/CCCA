EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE
LEADERS OF THE TEA PARTY
MOVEMENT.
HE'S MAD AS HELL AND HE'S GOING
TO TAKE IT FOR ABOUT SIX
MINUTES.
PLEASE WELCOME BRENDAN
STEINHAUSER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WOO, WOO.
HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> DOING WELL.
>> Stephen: HEY,
MR. STEINHAUSER.
YOU GOT A LITTLE IMPRESSIVE C.V.
HERE.
YOU'RE GOING TO TURN 29
TOMORROW.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND YOU ARE ONE OF
THE LEADING FIGURES IN THE TEA
PARTY MOVEMENT.
YOU WORK FOR FREEDOM WORK, WHICH
IS DICK ARMY'S OUTFIT, AND YOU
HELPED ENCOURAGE THE TEA PARTY
TO START ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF
AGO.
>> RIGHT, FEBRUARY 2009
AMERICANS REALLY STARTED TO
GET... THE ANGER REALLY STARTED
TO GROW.
>> Stephen: IT WAS 32 DAYS I
BELIEVE AFTER OBAMA TOOK OFFICE,
RIGHT?
>> THAT'S WHEN IT REACHED THE
TIPPING POINT.
>> Stephen: 32 WHOLE DAYS.
>> WE WERE ORGANIZING IN THE
FALL OF 2008.
WE WERE TRYING TO PEOPLE TO GET
OUT AND PROTEST THE TARP WHICH
PRESIDENT BUSH PUSHED FORWARD.
IT WASN'T UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO
GET OUR FEET UNDER US AS A
MOVEMENT.
TO GET TO PEOPLE TO PROTEST BY
FEBRUARY AND MARCH WHEN THIS
MOVEMENT.
REALLY TOOK OFF.
>> Stephen: DOES IT HELP
SPRINGTIME, GOOD WEATHER?
I'M NOT JOKING.
I'M CURIOUS.
DOES THAT REALLY HELP?
>> IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, BUT THE
KEY IS IT WAS A SPONTANEOUS
COMBUSTION WITH RICK SAN TELLY
SAYING, WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.
THIS IS AMERICA, THIS IS UNFAIR
FOR PEOPLE TO BAIL OUT THEIR
FRIENDS' MORTGAGES THEY CAN'T
AFFORD.
THAT MOMENT WAS VERY REAL, VERY
ORGANIC.
WE SAID, HERE'S WHERE WE GO FROM
HERE.
>> Stephen: YOU BELIEVE IT WAS
UNFAIR TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAD
MORTGAGES, BAILING PEOPLE OUT OF
THEIR MORTGAGES IS UNFAIR?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: BAILING OUT THE
BANKS IS UNFAIR?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: BAILING OUT
ANYBODY IS UNFAIR.
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.
>> Stephen: GOOD.
I BELIEVE I GOT MINE, JACK, AND
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN SUCK IT.
COME ON!
THAT SAID THAT AT BOSTON HARBOR.
IF I CAN'T HAVE TEA, NOBODY CAN
HAVE TEA.
>> MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
BAILED OUT WERE PEOPLE THAT
BOUGHT HOUSES THEY SIMPLY
COULDN'T AFFORD.
I HAD A BUDDY OUT IN CALIFORNIA
THAT WENT IN OVER HIS HEAD.
I DIDN'T BUY.
I SAVED MY MONEY.
NOW WE SEE THE MARKET COMPLETELY
DISTORTED.
PRICES ARE UP HERE WHERE IN D.C.
THEY SHOULD BE COMING DOWN SO
PEOPLE LIKE ME COULD AFFORD IT.
>> Stephen: CONTINUE THE
FORECLOSURES IS ONE OF THE
THINGS YOU'RE FOR?
>> I THINK THE MARKET HAS GOT TO
ALLOCATE...
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO
CONTINUE FORECLOSING OR YOU
WON'T FIND BOTTOM, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: SO EVEN ROBO
FORECLOSINGS THEY'RE TRYING TO
STOP IN CONGRESS, YOU'VE GOT TO
CONTINUE EVEN THE ROBO
FORECLOSINGS ON THE PEOPLE IN
OVER THEIR HEAD SO THE MARKET
CAN FIND ITS BOTTOM, CORRECT?
>> I'M SAYING THAT...
>> Stephen: WE SHOULD CONTINUE
TO FORECLOSE.
>> PRICES HAVE TO COME DOWN.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO
FORECLOSE ON EVERYONE.
>> THAT'S THE PROCESS.
>> Stephen: [BLEEPED] NOW,
SO... I'M WITH YOU.
COMPLETELY WITH YOU.
HOW DO WE THEN... ONCE EVERYBODY
DOESN'T HAVE PLACE TO LIVE, HOW
DO WE TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK?
CAN WE TAKE IT BACK?
I HOPE THIS IS A VICTORY?
IS THIS A VICTORY LAP?
>> THE GOVERNMENT IS THE
INSTITUTION WHICH HAS HELPED
CREATE THE HOUSING MARKET
PROBLEM, SPENDING MONEY WE CAN'T
AFFORD, THAT'S WRECKED SOCIAL
SECURITY, THE GOVERNEMNT THAT'S
CREATED ALL THESE PROBLEMS.
I THINK LEANING ON THE
GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE THESE
PROBLEMS IS THE ABSOLUTE
OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE
DOING.
>> Stephen: POLITICALLY HOW DO
WE TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK?
>> I THINK WE ARE.
>> Stephen: BACK FROM WHO?
>> REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN
POWER WHO HAVE BASICALLY BECOME
POWER HUNGRY ELITES WHO ARE
GOING OUT.
THE COMMON PERSON IS GETTING TAR
WITH THIS MOVEMENT.
WE'RE SEEING MARCO RUBIO IN
FLORIDA, SHARON RUBIN IN NEVADA,
PEOPLE ARE BEATING THE
REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT.
ON NOVEMBER 2nd WE'LL GO AND
BEAT THE DEMOCRATS.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU WILL.
ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN CONGRESS BACK,
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
BACK, THE SENATE DOESN'T LOOK
QUITE AS GOOD BECAUSE OF TEA
PARTY CANDIDATE CHRISTINE
O'DONNELL.
( LAUGHTER )
NOT YOUR FAULT, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPORTING HER?
>> WE'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THAT
RACE.
I WILL BE IN WEST VIRGINIA,
NEVADA, COLORADO, WASHINGTON.
THESE ARE THE PLACES WE THINK WE
CAN WIN.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T TAKE THE
SENATE.
YOU DO TAKE CONGRESS.
YOU HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.
TELL ME ABOUT THE SWEEPING
POLICY CHANGES YOU'LL PUT IN
PLACE?
>> WELL, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES UNDER
REPUBLICANS WITH THE TEA PARTY
MOVEMENT HOLDING THEM
ACCOUNTABLE AND THE SENATE MAYBE
UNDER REPUBLICAN CONTROL, TOO.
BUT IF WE CAN GET THEM TO PASS
GOOD LEGISLATION, PRESIDENT
OBAMA WILL HAVE TO COME TO THE
MIDDLE.
HE'S OUT ON THE FAR LEFT.
WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE DEAD
CENTER OF AMERICAN POLITICS.
OUR MESSAGE OF LIMITED
GOVERNMENT, OF THE NATIONAL DEBT
IS $14 TRILLION.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU HAVE TO
COME BACK TO THE CENTER LIKE
PRESIDENT CLINTON DID.
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO.
>> Stephen: TALK ABOUT SOME OF
THE CANDIDATES YOU HAVE GOING
HERE.
CARL PALADINO.
TEA PARTY?
HE SAYS HE'S TEA PARTY.
>> WE DON'T ENDORSE HIM.
ANYONE COULD BE TEA PARTY.
>> Stephen: I WISH I WAS
RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.
I HAVE THIS STUPID PARTY.
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL.
KELLY IOTT?
>> THE CANDIDATE FROM NEW
HAMPSHIRE?
>> Stephen: NO, THE GUY WHO
DRESSES UP AS A NAZI.
>> HE LIKES TO RE-ENACT WORLD
WAR II ON THE WEEKENDS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MOTIVATES HIM.
>> Stephen: HERE'S WHAT I
LIKE.
I THINK THIS IS AN UNFAIR
ACCUSATION OF THE TEA PARTY
MOVEMENT.
PEOPLE SAY, OH, IT'S SO
RESTRICTED, IT'S ALL JUST LIKE
THESE ONE TYPE OF PEOPLE AND
THEY DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE.
IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG TENT.
YOU KNOW.
YOU GOT THE NO MASTURBATING PLUS
THE GUY WHO SENDS OUT THE
BEASTALTY VIDEO.
THAT'S A BROAD CONSENSUS THERE.
>> YEAH.
49%, A POLL SHOWED 49% OF
DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN
WHAT THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT
MESSAGE IS, LOWER TAXES AND LESS
GOVERNMENT.
SO I THINK IT INCLUDES
DEMOCRATS.
IT INCLUDES A LOT OF DISAFFECTED
REPUBLICANS, LIBERTARIANS.
THIS MOVEMENT IS WINNING BECAUSE
IT'S STAYING ON THE MESSAGE FOR
THE MOST PART OF REDUCING THE
NATIONAL DEBT.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT THE
GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR LIVE,
WHICH I LIKE, BUT THE ONLY THING
THAT GIVES ME PAUSE ON THAT IS
LETTING THE GAYS DO WHAT THEY
WANT.
YOU'RE NOT FOR THAT?
BECAUSE THAT CREEPS ME OUT
FRANKLY, LETTING THE GAYS HAVE
THE THINGS THAT WE GOT REALLY
PEEVES ME.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ON THE OLD GAY
THING?
>> THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THE TEA
PARTY MOVEMENT ADDRESSES.
MOST PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS
MOVEMENT SAY WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
FISCAL ISSUES AND FOCUS ON
ISSUES THAT UNITE US.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF
DISAGREEMENTS OVER SOCIAL
ISSUES, SO I'LL LET PEOPLE HAVE
THEIR OWN OPINIONS.
>> Stephen: LIBERTARIANS ARE
BIG ON SMOKING THE DOPE.
>> AGAIN, IT'S NOT AN ISSUE
THAT'S COME UP.
I THINK YOU'D FIND A WIDE
VARIETY...
>> Stephen: IT'S NEVER COME UP
WITH YOU?
NEVER?
COME ON.
YOU'RE NEVER HOLDING PUBLIC
OFFICE.
TELL ME.
BRENDAN STEINHAUSER THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
