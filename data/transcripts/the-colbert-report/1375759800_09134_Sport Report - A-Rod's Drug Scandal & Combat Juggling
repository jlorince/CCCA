ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU
WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW I AM A
BORN SPORTSMAN.
IN FACT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MANY
DOCTORS THAT I HAVE ATHLETE'S
FEET.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FIRST UP ON THE SPORT REPORT,
BASEBALL.
FOLKS, LIKE ANY RED-BLOODED
AMERICAN MALE I'M AN AVID
WATCHER OF OUR NATIONAL PASTIME
HUZZAH HUZZAH FOR THE
WHITE-STOCKINGS.
GIVE WHAT-FOR TO THOSE FINKS ON
THE BROOKLYN BRIDEGROOMS BUT
LATELY OUR BELOVED GAME OF
BALL-AND-STICK OR ROUNDERS, AS
THE KIDS CALL IT, HAS HAD TO
CLEAN HOUSE AFTER ANOTHER
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG
SCANDAL.
PERSONALLY I WAS ALL FOR
WATCHING A BUNCH OF
WEAPONS-GRADE HUMANOID MONSTERS
TURN THIS SPORT INTO THEIR OWN
PERSONAL PACIFIC RIM BUT
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS AGAINST THE
RULES AND TODAY THE HAMMER CAME
DOWN ON ONE OF THE GAME'S MOST
RECOGNIZABLE LARGER THAN NORMAL
FACES.
>> THEY'VE ANNOUNCED THAT THIRD
BASEMAN ALEX RODRIGUEZ OF THE
NEW YORK YANKEES AND I'M READ
INNING DIRECTLY HAS BEEN
SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE 201 SEASON AND
ALSO POST SEASON AND THE ENTIRE
2014 SEASON AS WELL.
FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE JOINT
PREVENTION TREATMENT PROGRAM AND
BASIC AGREEMENT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
ALEX RODRIGUEZ OR AROD HAS BEEN
SUSPENDED THROUGH THE END OF
NEXT SEASON SO IF HE'S ON YOUR
FANTASY BASEBALL TEAM IT IS TIME
TO SWAP HIM OUT FOR A DIFFERENT
HOBBY.
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE AN ADULT AND
YOUR WIFE MISSES YOU.
NOW RODRIGUEZ HAS ALLEGEDLY BEEN
CONNECTED TO ALLEGED DOPING
OPERATIONS AT BIOGENESIS AN
ALLEGED MIAMI-BASED ALLEGED
ANTIAGING CLINIC ALLEGEDLY.
FOR THAT M.L.B. BASEBALL
SUSPENDED HIM A TOTAL OF 211
GAMES.
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS WHAT A SINGLE
BASEBALL GAME FEELS LIKE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW, FOLKS, BASEBALL'S
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS MAKE
THE FACTS OF THIS CASE A BIT OF
"HE SAID, SHE SAID, THEN HE
FLIPPEDDED OUT IN A ROID RAGE
AND PUNCHED A WATER HEATER" BUT
THE LEAGUE'S EVIDENCE AGAINST
RODRIGUEZ IS RUMORED TO BE
DAMNING.
>> THEY PROBABLY HAVE EVIDENCE
THAT HE TAMPERED WITH THE
INVESTIGATION AND MAYBE EVEN
TAMPERED WITH SOME OF WITNESSES.
>> THEY FEEL HE NOT ONLY
VIOLATED THE DRUG POLICY.
HE THEN TRIED TO GO AROUND AND
BUY UP EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM.
>> Stephen: SERIOUS STUFF.
THE LEAGUE GREW EVEN MORE
SUSPICIOUS LAST SUMMER WHEN
RODRIGUEZ WON HIS 7th TOUR
DE FRANCE.
PERSONALLY, FOLKS, I THINK THE
BASEBALL'S MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE
HERE.
A TWO-YEAR SUSPENSION MAY SOUND
LIKE A LOT TO YOU AND ME BUT NOT
TO SOMEONE WORKING SO HARD TO
LIVE FOREVER.
RODRIGUEZ CAN JUST WAIT BASEBALL
OUT IN HIS PRIVATE HERMETIC
CHAMBER OF FETAL BOVINE SERUM.
ON A PERSONAL NOTE MY THOUGHTS
GO OUT TO AROD.
I'M SURE HE'LL HAVE A TOUGH TIME
BEING AWAY FROM THE GAME HE
LOVES WHILE CONTINUING TO PLAY
THROUGH HIS APPEAL AND
COLLECTING $61 MILLION IN
GUARANTEED SALARY EVEN IF HIS
CAREER IS OVER.
BUT REMEMBER THANKS TO
BIOGENESIS HE HAS TO SPREAD THAT
$61 MILLION OUT OVER THE NEXT
2,000 YEARS.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, BASEBALL IS
NOT THE ONLY HOT-WEATHER GAME.
AS YOU KNOW, EVERY SUMMER ON
THIS SHOW I ANNOUNCE WHAT SPORT
WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE OBSESSED
WITH.
IN YEARS PAST IT WAS TIMBER
SPORTS, CANOE DANCING, DRESSAGE,
AND THE SHORT-LIVEDDED HORSE
CANOE-CHOPPING.
WELL, GET READY, FOLKS, BECAUSE
THIS SUMMER WE ARE ALL GOING TO
BE INTO THE HOTTEST NEW GAME OUT
THERE.
COMBAT JUGGLING.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
KIDS LOVE THIS.
KIDS LOVE COMBAT JUGGLING.
NOW, I KNOW COMBAT JUGGLING
SOUNDS COMPLICATED SO LET ME
BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU.
IT'S JUGGLING PLUS COMBAT.
JIM?
>> WHAT A MOVE THERE.
(SCREAMING).
>> Stephen: BOOYAH!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, BABY!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT IS SOME PRIMO COME-JUG.
YOU JUST GOT SERVED, ONE
IMAGINES.
FOLKS, THIS IS THE SPORT FOR YOU
IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN SOMEONE
JUGGLING AND THOUGHT, "MAN, I'D
LIKE TO PUNCH THAT GUY."
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS.
COM-JUG IS HARD CORE.
COMBATANTS MUST DISRUPT THEIR
OPPONENT'S JUGGLING BY THROWING
A CLUB HIGH IN THE AIR AND
ATTACKING THEM BEFORE CATCHING
THEIR CLUB AND RESUMING A
THREE-CLUB JUGGLE COMBINING THE
SKILL OF MIXED MARSHAL ARTS WITH
THE HIGH-STAKES EXCITEMENT OF A
FOURTH GRADE BIRTHDAY PARTY.
FOLKS, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT
COM-JUG VARIATIONS INCLUDING
ZOMBIE BOMB CAT AND SUMO COMBAT
WHERE TWO JUGGLERS TRY TO FORCE
EACH OTHER OUT OF A CIRCLE AND
OF COURSE SOLO COMBAT WHERE YOU
STAY HOME KISSING A PILLOW
BECAUSE THE GIRLS AT SCHOOL
FOUND OUT YOU DO COMBAT
JUGGLING.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOLKS, I'M SWEPT UP IN COM-JUG.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I WISH
OTHER STREET PERFORMANCES WOULD
ADD A COMBAT ELEMENT LIKE
CARICATURE ARTIST THUNDER DOME.
TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVES
WITH A GIANT HEAD HITTING A GOLF
BALL OFF THE EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING OR ULTIMATE BALLOON
ANIMAL WRESTLING WHERE YOU NOT
ONLY HAVE TO PIN YOUR OPPONENT
BUT TIME HIM INTO A POODLE.
