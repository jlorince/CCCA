>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK
THESE DAYS ABOUT EQUAL PAY FORWOMEN.
WELL, I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOTOF TALK.
I WASN'T REALLY PAYINGATTENTION.
GAME IS ON.
IT TURNS OUT EARNING LESS ISGOOD.
JUST ASK CONSERVATIVE ICON ANDLADY WHO GIVES OUT RAISINS  AT
HALLOWEEN, PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY.
SHE WROTE WOMEN TYPICALLY CHOOSEA MATE, HUSBAND, OR BOYFRIEND
WHO EARNS MORE THAN SHE DOES.
WHILE WOMEN PEFER A HIGHEREARNING PARTNER, MEN LIKE TO BE
THE HIGHER EARNING PARTNER.
MEN LIKE WOMEN WHO DON'T EARNMUCH MONEY.
THAT'S WHY THE HOTTEST PLACE TOPICK UP A LADY IS A HOMELESS
SHELTER. BUT BE CAREFULFELLAS, HER IMAGINARY
ROOMMATE IS CRAZY.
THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE--WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED TO MEN WHO
MAKE MORE MONEY.
WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN SLEEPWITH DONALD TRUMP?
( LAUGHTER )SERIOUSLY, DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY?
( LAUGHTER )IS IT A DARE LIKE THE CINNAMON
CHALLENGE OR SOMETHING?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
IT WOULD EXPLAIN HIS SKIN COLOR.
NOW, THE DANGER-- THE DANGERSCHLAFLY WARNS IS THAT IF WE
ELIMINATE THE PAY GAP, ROMANCEWILL DIE, SIMPLE ARITHMETIC
SUGGESTS HALF OF WOMEN WOULD BEUNABLE TO FIND WHAT THEY REGARD
AS A SUITABLE MATE.
IF A HIGHER EARNING MAN IS NOTAVAILABLE, MANY WOMEN ARE MORE
LIKELY NOT TO MARRY AT ALL.
SO ENJOY YOUR EQUAL PAY, LADIES.
YOU CAN SPEND IT ON FRISKIES FORYOUR HUNDREDS OF CATS BECAUSE
YOU'RE DYING ALONE.
WOMEN, COME ON.
WOMEN, BE HONEST.
BE HONEST, WOMEN.
DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT--YOU LIKE A GUY TO EARN MORE THAN
YOU.
SAME WAY YOU LIKE THEM TO OPENDOORS OR GIVE UP THEIR SEAT ON
THE BUS YOU'RE RIDING BECAUSEYOU CAN'T AFFORD A CAR.
( LAUGHTER )MEANWHILE, SCHLAFLY'S ARTICLE
TOUCHED OFF THE PREDICTABLEMEDIA FIRESTORM FROM THE LIBERAL
LADIES.
BUT COME ON, IF THESE FEMALEJOURNALISTS REALLY THOUGHT THEY
SHOULD GET PAID MORE, WHY DIDTHEY GO INTO JOURNALISM?
AND THESE DAMES DON'T REALIZETHAT SCHLAFLY IS TRYING TO HELP
WOMEN BY HELPING MEN SO THEY CANHELP WOMEN.
AS PHYLLIS SO ELOQUENTLY SAID,THE PAY GAP HELPS PROMOTE AND
SUSTAIN MARRIAGES.
THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE ECONOMICPROSPECTS FOR WOMEN IS TO
IMPROVE JOB PROSPECTS FOR MEN INTHEIR LIVES, EVEN THAT MEANS
INCREASING THE SO-CALLED PAYGAP.
WELL SAID.
TO HELP WOMEN, WE MAY NEED TOINCREASE THE PAY GAP.
77 CENTS TO THE DOLLAR IS A GOODSTART BUT WE CAN DO BETTER.
WHY NOT 50 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR?
OR, OR CALL ME A RADICALFEMINIST, BUT MAYBE WOMEN
SHOULDN'T BE PAID AT ALL.
DON'T LISTEN TO ME, LADIES.
I'M JUST A GUY WHO MAKES MORETHAN YOU.
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME PERSONALRESPONSIBILITY HERE.
TOMORROW MORNING I WANT YOU TOMARCH INTO YOUR BOSS' OFFICE AND
SAY MR. THOMPSON I'VE PROVENMYSELF.
I'VE GOT INITIATIVE.
I'VE GOT ENTHUSIASM.
I'VE EXCEEDED MY SALES QUOTAWHICH IS WHY I DEMAND A 25% PAY
CUT AND GIVE THAT MONEY TO CHUCKIN THE MAILROOM.
HE'S NICE.
SHE'S SINGLE, AND IF I COULDN'TMAKE RENT, HE'D SEEM LIKE A
DREAM BOAT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
