>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
TODAY THAT SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE
WEB SITES LIKE WIKIPEDIA, REDDIT
AND BOING-BOING HAVE ALL GONE
DARK, WHICH MEANS INTERNET
USERS, THAT BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH
YOU WERE LOOKING AT THIS
MORNING, THAT'S THE SKY.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU'RE STILL CONFUSED, LOOK
IT UP ON WIKIPEDIA TOMORROW.
THESE SITES ARE GONE DARK TODAY
TO PROTEST THE STOP ONLINE
PIRACY ACT AND THE PROTECT
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACT OR
SOPA AND PIPA, TWO BILLS WHICH
COULD CHANGE THE INTERNET
FOREVER.
>> IT'S A PROPOSED BILL THAT
AIMS TO CRACK DOWN ON COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT, BUT SOPA WOULD
ALSO RESTRICT ACCESS TO ENTIRE
WEB SITES THAT HOST EVEN ONE
PIECE OF CONTENT OBTAINED
WITHOUT PERMISSION.
>> DON'T WORRY, TMZ IS SAFE.
THEY ARE FREE OF CONTENT.
NOW, TAKING WIKIPEDIA DOWN MAY
BE A FLASHY PROTEST, BUT IT
HASN'T AFFECTED ME IN THE LEAST
BECAUSE I'M SOMETHING OF AN
ENCYCLOPEDIA ORIGINALIST.
A COUPLE TIMES A MONTH I HAVE
WIKIPEDIA PRINTED OUT AND BOUND.
THIS IS VOLUME 5,470, STAR TREK
YEOMAN RANGD THROUGH YEOMAN
SMITH, B.
FOLKS, WHILE I AM NO FAN OF
INTERNET CENSORSHIP, WE MUST PUT
AN END TO ALL OF THIS COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT.
CON TETD PROVIDERS LIKE ME ARE
GETTING ROBBED BY PEOPLE POSTING
PIRATE BOOTLEG VIDEOS LIKE THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
I WAS NOT PAID FOR ANY OF THAT
FOOTAGE.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THAT
DOG SHOULD GET THE CHAIR, OR
POSSIBLY THE COUCH.
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THESE SITES
GOING ON STRIKE.
I SAY THE INTERNET HAS TOO MUCH
CONTROL OVER WHAT'S ON THE WEB.
THAT ENDS TONIGHT.
I CAN PROVIDE ANYTHING THAT THE
INTERNET GIVES YOU.
FOR INSTANCE, YOU MISS READ IT
TODAY.
NO PROBLEM.
GOT THAT COVERED.
HERE IS A PICTURE OF A CAT
PLAYING XBOX AGAINST RICHARD
DAWKINS WEARING YODA EARS.
KARMA POINTS, PLEASE.
AND FOR THOSE WHO LIKE
BOING-BOING, NO PROBLEM.
HERE IS THE NEW DOMINO'S STUFFED
CHEESY BREAD COMMERCIAL SET TO
THE IMPERIAL MARCH FROM STAR
WARS.
[IMPERIAL MARCH PLAYING]
>> I FIND YOUR LACK OF CHEESE
DISTURBING.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: FINALLY, FOR
IPAD USERS, I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU, TOO.
