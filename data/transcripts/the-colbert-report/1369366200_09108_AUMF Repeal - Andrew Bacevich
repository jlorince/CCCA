#KABOOM.
BUT YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THESE DAYS
IT SEEMS LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE.
HERE TO TELL ME HE WANTS TO KEEP
AMERICA SAFE IS RETIRED ARMY
COLONEL AND PROFESSOR OF
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT
BOSTON UNIVERSITY, ANDREW
BACEVICH.
COLONEL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
BEING ON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
NOW, WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKED
ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE
A.U.M.F. TODAY IN HIS SPEECH, IT
ALMOST SEEMED LIKE HE WAS SAYING
THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THE
WAR ON TERROR WILL END.
>> WE WOULD HOPE SO.
>> Stephen:  NO, BUT-- NO!
( LAUGHTER )
THERE WILL ALWAYS ABE TIME WHEN
I COULD BE TERRIFIED AND-- AND
IN SUCH CASE, WE SHOULD BE AT
WAR WITH THAT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WE MAY DIFFER ON THE
FUNDAMENTAL POINT.
>> Stephen:  WE MIGHT.
YOU MIGHT BE WRONG.
>> I THINK WAR IS BAD.
YOU THINK WAR IS...?
>> Stephen:  SOMETIMES
NECESSARY, SIR, SOMETIMES
NECESSARY.
>> AGREED AND ONLY WHEN
NECESSARY SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO GO
TO WAR.
AND WHEN WE CHOOSE TO GO TO WAR,
WE REALLY OUGHT TO ADHERE TO THE
PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION.
MEANING CONGRESS DECIDES AND
AUTHORIZES THE PRESIDENT TO WAGE
WAR.
>> Stephenn  BUT THEY DID.
THEY DID.
THEY AUTHORIZED HIM.
THEY PASSED THIS THING THAT SAID
GO GET HIM!
, IS IC HIM!
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
WHEN A CRISIS OCCURS THE
CONGRESS SAID-- THE CONGRESS
THROWS THE PRESIDENT THE KEYS TO
THE CAR AND SAYS DRIVE WHEREVER
YOU WANT TO.
SEND US THE BILL.
>> Stephen:  RIGHT.
RUN OVER OUR ENEMIES.
>> WELL, PRESIDENT BUSH RAN OVER
THE CLIFF.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE
SOMEWHAT BETTER, AND BASED ON
HIS SPEECH TODAY, SEEMS TO HAVE
COME TO A REALIZATION THAT, HE
WANTS TO SAY TO THE CONGRESS,
"HERE, MAYBE SHUTAKE THE KEYS
BACK."
IS THERE WHY WOULD REQUEST
PRESIDENT WANT TO SURRENDER
POWER?
THAT'S LIKE SUPERMAN SAYING I'LL
TAKE A KRYPTONITE ENEMA, PLEASE?
>> IF YOU READ THE TEXT OF THE
NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY
SPEECH, THE PRESIDENT IN EFFECT
IS ADMITTING HIS RELIANCE ON
DRONES, THIS PROGRAM OF TARGETED
ASSASSINATION, MAY HAVE SOME
UPSIDES BUT IT HAS SIGNIFICANT
DOWNSIDES.
HE'S NOW ACKNOWLEDGE AGO.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DOWNSIDE?
>> THE DOWNSIDE IS IT ALIEN AETS
A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE
WORLD'S POPULATION.
OH, NO!
ARE YOU SAYING THE ARABS MAY NOT
LIKE US?
>> THE ARABS, MANY OF THEM,
DON'T LIKE US.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S WHY WE
NEED THIS.
WE CAN'T BE THE GOOD GUYS.
GOOD GUY COUNTRIES FINISH LAST.
>> IF WAR IS GOOD, EUROPE RIGHT.
IF WAR IS BAD, I'M RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  I'M NOT SAYING
WAR IS GOOD.
I'M SAYING VIGILANCE IS
NECESSARY.
THAT SOUND GOOD.
I LIKE THAT.
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME CONGRESS
DECLARED WAR.
>> WORLD WAR II.
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
AGAINST THE JAPANESE AND THE
NAZIS, THAT'S LAST TIME?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Stephen:  WHAT HAVE WE DONE
SINCE THEN?
>> WORKAROUNDLEADING TO THE
COMMANDER IN CHIEF CLAIMING EVER
MORE AUTHORITY TO DO WHATEVER
THE HELL HE WANTS TO DO.
>> Stephen:  AND IT SEEMS TO
HAVE WORK OUTSIDE ON THE OKAY.
>> WE MAY DIFFER.
>> Stephen:  WE MAY DIFFER ON
THAT ONE.
>> WE MAY DIFFER WITH REGARD TO
THE NECESSITY AND OUTCOME OF THE
IRAQ WAR WHICH I WOULD JUDGE TO
HAVE BEEN TOTAL TOTALLY
UNNECESSARY AND COMPLETELY
DISASTROUS.
>> Stephen:  SO YOU'D RATHER
SEE SADDAM BACK IN POWER.
THOSE ARE YOUR WORD.
YOU JUST SAID THAT.
ALL RIGHT?
>> YOU WIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE MY
FAVORITE KIND OF GUEST.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ANDREW BACEVICH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
