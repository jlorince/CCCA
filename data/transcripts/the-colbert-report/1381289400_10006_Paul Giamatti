THE CAMERA HE HAD WAS THECUTTING EDGE SUPER 8 FILMAT THE

CONSPIRACY THEORIES-->> Stephen:  THE IDEA THAT ONE
GUY SHOT THE PRESIDENT ISDINED'D KIND OF BOTHER AND SAD.

BEHIND THE KEEPS OF OUR ADULTLIFE, THAT'S KIND OF EXCITING.
>> IT'S WEIRDLY COMFORTING, TOO,I THINK TO PEOPLE.
I THINK IT'S HARD TOREUNDERSTAND ONE PERSON DOING
SOMETHING.
YOU CAN'T FATHOM OF PSYCHOLOGYOF ONE MAN SNAPPING LIKE THAT.
I THINK IT'S COMFORTING TOTHINK, WELL, THERE'S A WHOLE
SYSTEM AT WORK.
>> Stephen:  ALSO THAT ITWOULD TAKE A WHOLE SYSTEM TO
BRING DOWN THE PRESIDENT.
