FOLKS, AS A GREAT JOURNALISTONCE SAID--
>> WHAT IS THIS?
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
>> Stephen:  HERE TO MAKESENSE OF WHATEVER IT IS IS
FORMER SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF NORMSTAMPER.
NORM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING ME.
NORM, YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OFRANKING RANK, A TOP COP EXPOSE
OF THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICANPOLICING.
OKAY, YOU WERE THE POLICE CHIEFOF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.
YOU DID SOME GOOD WORK THERE.
FOR INSTANCE, IN 1999, THE WTO,WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION,
MEETING WAS GOING ON IN SEATTLE.
THINGS WENT CRAZY.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
>> WELL, WE GASSED NONVIOLENT,NONTHREATENING PROTESTERS.
>> Stephen:  GOOD FOR YOU.
GOOD FOR YOU.
OKAY.
YOU HAVE CALLED THAT THEWORST MISTAKE OF YOUR CAREER.
WHY?
IS IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW TODAYTHERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WEAPONS
YOU COULD USE AGAINST NONVIOLENTPROTESTERS.
YOU COULD USE A SOUND CANNONNOW.
>> LOOK, WE HAD ALL OF OURPOLICE OFFICERS OUT THERE, THOSE
ON THE FRONT LINE, IN MILITARYGARB, CARRYING MILITARY WEAPONS
AND ENGAGING IN AGGRESSIVEMILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST
NONVIOLENT PROTESTERS.
WE THOUGHT WE HAD TO DO THAT.
WE BELIEVED WE NEEDED, FOREXAMPLE, TO CLEAR A PARTICULAR
INTERSECTION.
WELL, DID WE REALLY?
DID WE HAVE TO CLEAR THATINTERSECTION?
>> Stephen:  THEY SMASHED THEWINDOWS OF A STARBUCK.
DON'T YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TOSHOOT RUBBER BULLETS.
>> THEY WENT BEYOND SMASHING THEWINDOWS.
THEY ACTUALLY TOOK COFFEE FROMTHAT STORE AS WELL, IN SEATTLE.
>> Stephen:  I BELIEVE AVENTIIS GRAND THEFT.
>> I BELIEVE IT IS.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  BUT POLICE ARETHERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT,
RIGHT?
>> THEY ARE.
>> Stephen:  ISN'T A BIGGERGUN OR MORE WEAPONRY JUST MORE
SERVING AND BIGGER PROTECTION?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> STEPHEN, THIS MILITARIZATIONMOVEMENT IS
EXACERBATING A REALLY STRAINEDRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE AND
COMMUNITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
NO MORE THAN IN COMMUNITIES OFCOLOR WITH POOR PEOPLE AND YOUNG
PEOPLE, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BEABOUT DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS,
BEING PART OF, NOT APART FROMOUR COMMUNITY.
>> Stephen:  WHY WOULD THEPOLICE WANT TO BE PART OF THE
COMMUNITY?
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY ISWHERE THE CRIMINALS LIVE?
>> WELL, BECAUSE, THIS ISAMERICA.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
>> AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  YOU JUST PLAYEDTHE "THIS IS AMERICA" CARD.
>> I CERTAINLY DID.
>> Stephen:  IT'S TECHNICALLYMY CARD.
BUT GO AHEAD.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WELL, I STAND CORRECTED.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, GOAHEAD.
IT'S AMERICA.
>> I THINK IT'S VITAL THATPOLICE OFFICERS ESTABLISH
GENUINE PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH THECOMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.
>> Stephen:  SO THE POLICEMENGET THE EQUIPMENT.
HERE'S ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKEABOUT THE PENTAGON PROGRAM IS
YOU REQUEST THE EQUIPMENT.
YOU HAVE TO DECLARE THE NEED.
BUT IF YOU DON'T USE IT WITHINONE YEAR, YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE
EQUIPMENT BACK.
AND SO, THE POLICE SAY THEY NEEDIT FOR SOMETHING, AND THEN THEY
USE IT TO PROVE THAT THEY NEEDEDIT, PROVING THAT THEY DID.
DOESN'T THAT MEAN THE SYSTEM ISWORKING?
( LAUGHTER )>> WHAT THAT DOES IS CREATE AN
INCENTIVE FOR POLICE OFFICERS TOGET INTO ONE OF THOSE ARMORED
VEHICLES ARMED TO THE TEETH, ANDIN A PREDAWN DRUG RAID OF A
FAMILY HOME, HIT A SUSPECTEDLOW-LEVEL, NONVIOLENT DRUG
OFFENDER WHO WAS SEEN TO BE INPOSSESSION OF HALF A BAG OF
MARIJUANA.
THAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THISCOUNTRY.
>> Stephen:  ARE YOU SAYINGTHIS STUFF CAME ORIGINALLY--
IT'S NOT TERRORISM?
IT CAME FROM THE DRUG WAR?
>> IT BEGAN WITH THE DRUG WAR.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, SO HOW DOWE FIX THAT, THEN?
>> WE END THE DRUG WAR.
WE END IT YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
UM--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOLD ON.
MR. STAMPER, ARE YOU HIGH?
>> NO.
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT HIGH?
>> I'M NOT.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT HIGH.
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  I'M NOT WEARING AWIRE.
YOU CAN TELL ME.
>> WE HAVE WITNESSES.
>> Stephen:  ON AVERAGE, THEREWERE ABOUT 3,000 SWAT TEAMS
RAIDS EVERY YEAR.
THERE ARE 50,000 SWAT TEAM RAIDSEVERY YEAR NOW.
WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE SURE THATNEVER HAPPENS TO ME?
( LAUGHTER )>> WELL, BEHAVE YOURSELF.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, I AM.
>> AND SECONDLY, WORK WITH YOURNEIGHBORS.
WORK WITH YOUR COMMUNITY.
ORGANIZE, MOBILIZE, TELL YOURPOLICE DEPARTMENT THAT WE DO NOT
WANT TO SEE THIS MILITARYEQUIPMENT AND THESE MILITARY
TACTICS EMPLOYED IN EVERYDAY,ROUTINE, SOMETIMES
NOT-SO-ROUTINE CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Stephen:  UM, WELL, UM,I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I HOPE
THERE'S NEVER A REASON TO HAVEYOU BACK.
( LAUGHTER )BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NORM STAMPER, THE AUTHOR OF"BREAKING RANK."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
