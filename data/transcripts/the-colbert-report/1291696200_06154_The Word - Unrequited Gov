FOLKS, THIS WEEK UNEMPLOYMENT
HIT 9.8%, BUT THERE IS SOME GOOD
NEWS.
THE TOP 2% OF WAGE EARNERS LIKE
ME ARE GOING TO GET OUR BUSH TAX
CUT EXTENDED.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE TAX RATE
TO STAY EXACTLY THE SAME SO I
CAN CREATE ALL THOSE JOBS.
AND WE RICH FOLKS WOULDN'T HAVE
OUR TAX CUTS IF THE PRESIDENT
WASN'T WILLING TO FIGHT ALL THE
DEMOCRATS WHO WANT HIM TO FIGHT
THE REPUBLICANS.
>> WHAT LIBERALS ARE VERY
WORRIED ABOUT IS THEY SEE THE
PRESIDENT BUCKLING AND THEY
THINK THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A
LONG STRING OF BUCKLING.
>> HE DOES THIS ALL THE TIME.
HE BARGAINS WITH HIMSELF.
>> Stephen: WORST OF ALL, HE
ALWAYS TALKS HIMSELF INTO
GETTING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.
AND THIS ONGOING WILLINGNESS TO
BEND TO REPUBLICAN DEMANDS
BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S.
WORD.
UNREQUITED GOV.
FOLKS, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD
SAY THIS, BUT I AM WORRIED
BARACK OBAMA.
FROM THE MOMENT HE GOT INTO
OFFICE, HE HAS HAD ONE THING AND
ONE THING ONLY ON HIS MIND:
WINNING OVER THE G.O.P.
OVER AND OVER HE HAS TRIED
HOOKING UP WITH THEM.
( LAUGHTER )
FIRST OFF, JUST TAKE THE
STIMULUS PLAN.
THE REPUBLICANS IMMEDIATELY GAVE
IT THE COLD SHOULDER.
SO HE SWEETENED THE DEAL WITH
$250 BILLION IN TAX CUTS.
NOW, IN EXCHANGE, THE
REPUBLICANS GAVE OBAMA NOTHING,
NADA, NIENTA, NOLO, NULSET.
DID THAT STOP THE PRESIDENT FROM
REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE?
NO.
WHEN HEALTH CARE WAS BEING
CRAFTED, THE REPUBLICANS SAID
FORGET IT, SO OBAMA DROPPED THE
PUBLIC OPTION.
THEN TO THANK HIM, THE
REPUBLICANS GAVE OBAMA NOTHING,
ZILCH, ZERO, JACK SQUAT
A LA MODE.
NOW, WE COME TO EXTENDING THE
BUSH TAX CUTS MORE THE
WEALTHIEST 2%.
ONCE AGAIN THE PRESIDENT IS OPEN
TO COMPROMISE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.
JIM?
>> THE REPUBLICANS JUST AREN'T
IN THE MOOD TO COMPROMISE.
>> THERE IS NO COMPROMISE HERE.
>> THE REPUBLICANS AREN'T GOING
TO SAY YES TO ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT,
FACE THE FACTS: REPUBLICANS JUST
AREN'T THAT INTO YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
AFTER ALL, AFTER ALL, SIR,
REMEMBER WHAT MITCH McCONNELL
SAID THEIR TOP PRIORITY IS.
>> OF TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY
OVER NEXT TWO YEARS SHOULD BE TO
DENY PRESIDENT OBAMA A SECOND
TERM.
>>
>> Stephen: THAT'S CALLED
PLAYING HARD TO GET.
NOW, GIVEN THEY ARE FLATLY
STATING THAT NOTHING YOU DO WILL
EVER CHANGE THEIR MINDS, I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO REALIZE
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP TRYING.
YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO GETTING THEM
TO LIKE YOU.
SO PLEASE, PLEASE,
MR. PRESIDENT, DO NOT GIVE UP.
GIVE MORE.
REPEAL THE ESTATE TAX, INCREASE
DEFENSE SPEND, PRIVATEIZE SOCIAL
SECURITY, AND WHO KNOWS, SOME
DAY MAYBE THE REPUBLICANS WILL
LOVE YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
OR MAYBE NOT.
BUT ISN'T IT BETTER TO HAVE
LOVED AND LOST THAN TO HAVE
FOUGHT AND WON.
