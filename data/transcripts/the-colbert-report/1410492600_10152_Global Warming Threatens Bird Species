>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW --
I KNOW THE WORLD'S A COMPLICATEDPLACE AND I'M NO SCIENTIST, BUT
I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT INTO ALL THEALARMISM ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
WHY FEAR CHANGE?
MAYBE EARTH IS JUST GOINGTHROUGH PUBERTY.
OUR GLACIERS ARE DROPPING.
JUNGLES CROPPING UP IN STRANGEPLACES AND SHE SOMETIMES WE WAKE
UP AND FIND OUR STREETS ALL WET.
IT'S NATURAL.
BUT IT TURNS OUT-- AND I DIDN'TKNOW THIS-- HUMANS AREN'T THE
ONLY CREATURES ON THE PLANET.
>> CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECTNORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.
THE NATIONAL AUDOBON SOCIETYSAID HALF OF OUR CONTINENT'S 650
SPECIES WILL BE FORCED TO FINDNEW PLACES TO LIVE, FEED, AND
BREED OVER THE NEXT 65 YEARS.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, THESE ARETHE SCARE TACTICS FROM THE
LOON-LOVING LOONS FROM THEAUDOBON SOCIETY.
THE STUDY'S AUTHOR ACTUALLYNAMES ONE BIRD THAT WILL THRIVE
AS THE EARTH WARMS, QUOTE --
"YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT CLIMATECHANGE SOUNDS LIKE?
IT'S THE SOUNDAVE MOURNINGDOVE."
YES.
THE HAUNTING CALL OF THEMOURNING DOVE REMINDS US OF ALL
WE'VE LOST.
LET ME GUESS.
THE OTHER SURVIVING SPECIES WILLBE THE NORTHERN GUILT-TRIP
SPARROW.
AND THE I TOLD YOU SONGBIRD.
>> I TOLD YOU SO.
I TOLD YOU SO.
>> Stephen:  BUT SADLY,OFFICIAL STATE BIRDS LIKE
LOUISIANA BROWN PELICAN,VERMONT'S HERMIT THRUSH, AND NEW
HAMPSHIRE'S PURPLE FINCH WILL BEPUSHED OUT OF THEIR STATES
COMPLETELY.
SUDDENLY THE HUNDREDS OF HOURS ISPENT MEMORIZING STATE TRIVIA
SEEMS LIKE A TOTAL WASTE OFTIME.
BY THE WAY-- A TOTAL WASTE OFTIME?
THE OFFICIAL STATE MOTTO OFDELAWARE.
STILL GOT IT.
( APPLAUSE )AND WORSE, AND WORSE THE STUDY
SAYS THAT THE STATE BIRD OFAMERICA, THE BALD EAGLE, MIGHT
HAVE ITS HABITAT DECREASED 75%BY 2080.
HOW CAN THAT BE?
I THOUGHT ITS NATIVE TERRITORYWAS DISCOUNT PATRIOTIC T-SHIRTS.
AND BASED ON THE SIZE WHAT I'VESEEN AT WAL-MART, THAT TERRITORY
IS EXPANDING.
FOLKS, THE INI HAVE ROW-NUTSDEMAND ENERGY SOURCES TO SAVE
THE BIRDS, NEW SOURCES.
BUT WHO'S GOING TO SAVE THEBIRDS FROM OUR NEW ENERGY
SOURCES?
WOULD THE AUDOBON VOT PREFERWIND POWER.
>> WIND FARMS I CAN MORE THAN100,000 BIRDS EACH YEAR.
>> IT'S PITTING GLOBAL WARMINGENVIRONMENTALISTS AGAINST THE
BIRD LOVERS AND WILDFIRECONSERVATION.
WHY?
BECAUSE WIND FARMS ARE KILLINGMORE THAN 1,000 BIRDS A DAY.
MANY ARE PROTECTED OR MIGRATORYSPECIES.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT,YOUR BELOVED WIND FARMS ARE JUST
HIGH-RISE CUISINARTS.
OH, OH, AND WHAT ABOUT YOURSPRESHES SOLAR ENERGY?
>> A NEW CONTROVERSY OVER SOLARPOWER IS LITEREALLY FLARING UP.
BIRDS ARE GETTING IGNITED INMIDFLIGHT AND FALLING FROM THE
SKY.
>> THE HEATING PRODUCES UP TO900 DEGREES IS CHARRING THE
FEATHERS OF BIRDS FLYINGTHROUGH, OFTEN CAUSING THEM TO
CRASH AND DIE.
>> Stephen:  HERE'S AN IDEA--PUT THE SOLAR PANELS NEXT TO THE
WIND TURBINES AND LET IT RAINSPARROW McNUGGETS.
JUST HAVE A POND FULL OF HONEMUSTARD FOR THEM TO FALL INTO.
WILL THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
I'M SORRY, BIRD LOVERS AT THISPOINT IT LOOKS LIKE AMERICA HAS
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HAVING BIRDSAND LIGHTBULBS.
I'M SORRY, I CHOOSE LIGHTBULBSBECAUSE I NEED THEM TO READ MY
AUDOBON GUIDE.
THE BIRDS ARE SO PRETTY.
BUT I WILL SAY ONE THING-- ASOUR PLANET WARMS, AMERICA WILL
NEED A NEW NATIONAL BIRD.
SO I HEREBY NOMINATE THEMAJESTIC, FRIDGIDARE 12000
B.T.U. WINDO AIR CONDITIONER,WITH TEMPERATURE-SENTENCING
REMOTE CONTROL.
BEHOLD HER GLORIOUS PLUMAGE ANDTHREE FAN SPEEDS.
AND LO DOTH SHE SOAR WHEN NOTPROPERLY SECURED WITH THE
INCLUDED WINDOW MOUNTING KIT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
