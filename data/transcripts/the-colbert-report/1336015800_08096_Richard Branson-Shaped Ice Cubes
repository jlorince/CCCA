STEPHEN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
YOU KNOW I I WOULD TRY TO STOP YOUR CHEERING BUT I WOULD NEVER WANT TO CENSOR YOU.
( LAUGHTER ).
( CHEERS ) NATION-- I'M SURE THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.
NATION, OVER THE YEARS, I'VE HAD MY DISAGREEMENTS WITH VIRGIN C.E.O. AND ADULT OF THE CORN,
RICHARD BRANSON.
SPECIFICALLY, MY LUNGS DISAGREED WITH THE FIRE RETARDANT HE FIRED INTO THEM THE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE.
ON THE PLUS SIDE, I CAN NOW BLOW OUT BIRTHDAY CANDILS LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.
I HAVE TO COMMEND HIM FOR THE LATEST EGOMANIACAL MOVE.
>> IN BRITAIN, PASSENGERS ON VIRGINIAIN ATLANTIC AIRLINE WILL BE ABLE TO CHILL OUT WITH
FOUNDER RICHARD BRANSON.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, A LITTLE RICHARD BRANSON ICE CUBE SHAPED LIKE RICHARD BRANSON'S HEAD.
IT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE UPPER CLASS ONLY.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
UPPER CLASS VIRGIN ATLANTIC PASSENGERS WILL BE GETTING ICE CUBES IN THE SHAPE OF SIR
RICHARD'S HEAD.
I BELIEVE IN COACH THEY GET ICE MOLDS OF HIS ASS.
AND BRANSOM'S FROSTY TRIBUTES TO HIMSELF AREN'T YOUR NORMAL EVERYDAY DISPLAYS OF TEMPORAL NARCISSISM.
NO.
IT TOOK A TEAM OF FOUR SKILLED DESIGNERS SIX WEEKS TO CREATE THE MOLD.
ONE TO MAKE THE MOLD WHILE THE OTHER THREE CRIED IN A CORNER WONDERING HOW THEIR YEARS CAME
TO THIS.
( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, BEING AMONG THE ELITE FEW WHO GETS ONE OF THESE CUBES IN
YOUR DRINK IS THE ULTIMATE SIGN OF SUCCESS.
I MEAN, IMAGINE SITTING IN UPPER CLASS ON VIRGIN ATLANTIC, CAN WITH A SCOTCH IN YOUR HAND.
SURE TO MAKE IT UP THE LADDER MAYBE DID YOU SOME THINGS YOU'RE NOT PROUD OF.
MAYBE YOU COMPROMISED WHO YOU'D HOPED YOU'D BE IN ORDER TO REACH FOR THAT BRASS RING.
MAYBE THAT MEANT NOT SPENDING TIME YOU SHOULD HAVE WITH YOUR WIFE AND YOUR CHILDREN WHO ARE
ALL GROWN AND GONE NOW.
( LAUGHTER ).
BUT YOU MADE IT TO THE TOP, AND HERE AT THE BOTTOM OF YOURT COCKTAIL ARE THE GLASSY,
HOLLOWIZE OF THE GRINNING GURKS ZMAN ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, SO
THIS IS WHAT I WAS DOING IT FOR.
( LAUGHTER ) MY PROFESSIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WILL SURELY BE AS PERMANENT AS THIS HEAD OF FROZEN WATER.
( LAUGHTER ) ANOTHER ROUND, PLEASE,
STEWARDESS.
AND KEEP THEM COMING.
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG FLIGHT.
( LAUGHTER
