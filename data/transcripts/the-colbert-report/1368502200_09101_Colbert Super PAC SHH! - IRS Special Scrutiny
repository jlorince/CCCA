FOLKS, BENGHAZI ISN'T EVEN THE
BEST.
I MEAN, WORST SCANDAL TO HIT THE
ADMINISTRATION TODAY.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO HAD TO
RESPOND TODAY TO ANOTHER FIRE
STORM.
THE ADMISSION BY THE I.R.S. THAT
IT GAVE EXTRA SCRUTINY TO
ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE WORDS,
QUOTE, TEA PARTY OR, QUOTE,
PATRIOT IN THEIR TITLES WHEN
THEY WERE APPLYING FOR
TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
>> AS EARLY AS MARCH 2010 THE
CINCINATTI FIELD OFFICE WHICH
WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF EVALUATING
APPLICATIONS FOR TAX-EXEMPT
STATUS BEGAN SEARCHING FOR
GROUPS WITH POLITICALLY
IDENTIFIABLE NAMES.
ACCORDING TOçó THE "WASHINGTON
POST" OF THE 298 GROUPS SELECTED
FOR SPECIAL SCRUTINY 72 HAD THE
WORDS "TEA PARTY" IN THEIR TITLE
>> Stephen: THE I.R.S. OWES AN
APOLOGY TO EVERY TEA PARTY GROUP
IN AMERICA INCLUDING SUZY
JOHNSON AND HER EIGHT STUFFED
ANIMALS.
FOLKS, OH, THEY'RE COMING FOR
HER.
FOLKS, THIS IS A NEW LOW FOR THE
I.R.S.
WHAT'S NEXT?
MAKING G.E. PAY TAXES?
FOLKS, THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO
DESCRIBE A SCANDAL THIS HOT.
>> THIS SHOULD SEND A CHILL UP
YOUR SPINE.
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY CHILLING
THAT THE I.R.S. WAS SINGLING OUT
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS FOR EXTRA
REVIEW.
>> THE A.C.L.U. IS TALKING ABOUT
HOW CHILLING THIS IS.
>> THIS IS CHILLING.
Stephen: IT'S CHILLING WHICH
ALSO DESCRIBES THE CHAMPAGNE
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO BREAK OUT
FOR JUST THIS SCANDAL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
BECAUSE...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS, THIS PROVES THAT
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER SAID ABOUT
OBAMA IS TRUE.
SO IT'S OFFICIAL.
HE'S A SECRET MUSLIM,
SHAPE-SHIFTING ALIEN FROM KENYA
WHO IS COMING FOR OUR GUNS AND
BO IS A MEMBER OF THE
ILLUMINATI.
FOLKS, OF COURSE, THE BIGGEST
VICTIM HERE, I'M SAD TO PROUDLY
SAY, IS ME.
YOU SEE, THE TAX EXEMPTIONS AT
ISSUE WERE FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS
KNOWN AS 501 C-4s LIKE CROSS
ROADS G.P.S.
LONG-TIME VIEWERS WILL REMEMBER
MY LOVE OF EXPLAINING THAT THESE
GROUPS DO NOT HAVE TO DISCLOSE
THEIR DONORS AND ARE ALLOWED TO
TAKE PART IN POLITICAL
ACTIVITIES BUT THEIR PRIMARY
PURPOSE MUST TO BE PROCEED AT
THE TIME SOCIAL WELFARE.
FOR EXAMPLE, KARL ROVE'S
CROSSROADS G.P.S. WORKS TO
PROMOTE SOCIAL WELFARE BY
CAMPAIGNING TO ELIMINATE
WELFARE.
OF COURSE, THE MOST FAMOUS 501
C-4 OF ALL IS COLBERT SUPERPAC
S-H-H.
YOU REMEMBER OUR MOTTO: MAKING A
BETTER TOMORROW, TOMORROW.
WELL, THE I.R.S. MUST KNOW OUR
MOTTO TOO BECAUSE THEY WERE
CAUGHT SINGLING OUT 501 C-4
APPLICATIONS THAT INCLUDED
PHRASES LIKE "MAKE AMERICA A
BETTER PLACE TO LIVE."
I BET THEY ALSO SINGLED OUT
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CLAIMED A HAM
AS A DEPENDENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
