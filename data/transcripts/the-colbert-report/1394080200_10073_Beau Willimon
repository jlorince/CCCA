>> WELCOME BACK, MY GUESTTONIGHT CREATED HOUSE OF
CARDS, ABOUT A MURDEROUSBACK STABBING POWER HUNGRY
POLITICIAN. WHERE DO I SENDMY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.
PLEASE WELCOME BEAU WILLIMON.
HEY, BEAU, THANKS FOR COMINGON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'TKNOW YOU ARE THE CREATOR
SHOW RUNNER AND WRITER FORHOUSE OF CARDS.
>> LAST YEAR WAS NOMINATEDFOR 9 EMMIES, FIRST ON-LINE
SHOW TO EVER WIN A MAJORCATEGORY.
I GOT A BONE TO PICK WITHYOU.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I'M TWO MINDSABOUT YOU.
>> OKAY.
WHAT'S THE FIRST ONE.
>> Stephen: THE FIRST ONE ISI HAVE DONE 75 BETTER KNOW A
DISTRICTS AND I'VE MET THESEPEOPLE, THESE CONGRESSMAN
AND YOU HAVE GOT THEM DEADTO RIGHTS.
THEY ARE CUNNING.
THEY ARE SUPERMOTIVATED,SEXY PEOPLE AND YOU
CAN'T-- AND YOU CAN'T GETANYTHING BY THEM.
ALL RIGHT?
THE SECOND THING IS THATYOU ARE SHOWING THE CHINESE
WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY'S LIKE INA BAD LIGHT.
YOU KNOW THE CHINESELEADERSHIP LOVE-- SAY THAT
IS WHAT YOU GET WITHDEMOCRACY.
>> THE REMARKABLE THING ISTHAT THE SHOW IS NOT AT ALL
CENSORED IN CHINA, IT IS ONEOF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
AMERICAN SHOWS IN I THINKCHINESE TELEVISION HISTORY.
AND IT IS A HUGE HIT THEREAND I THINK PART OF THE
REASON IS EXACTLY AS ARE YOUSAYING, IT PROVES JUST WE
ARE AS CORRUPT AS ANYONEELSE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU-- HOW-- ITHINK IT'S PERFECTLY
ACCURATE.
I HAVE MET MEMBERS OFCONGRESS AND THEY ARE JUST
LIKE KEVIN SPACEY.
(LAUGHTER)HOW ACCURATE ARE YOU TRYING
TO BE?
>> KEVIN'S CHARACTERDOES SOME THINGS THAT ARE A
LITTLE ETHICALLY DUBIOUS.
THERE MIGHT IT BE LEAVINGSOMEONE IN A GARAGE WHILE
THE CAR IS RUNNING.
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHINGINVOLVING A SUBWAY TRAIN.
AND I DON'T-- .
>> Stephen: THIS HE IS SONHE BECOMES VICE PRESIDENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLEHAS JOE BIDEN BLUDGEONED TO
DEATH?
DO YOU THINK IT'S A DEPICTIONOF A WASHINGTON PEOPLE
RECOGNIZE?
>> LOOK, ONE THING THEY DORECOGNIZE IS THAT IN OUR
SHOW AS IN THE REAL WORLD,WE HAVE A WASHINGTON THAT IS
PARALYZED BY POLITICALGRIDLOCK.
WHAT WE HAVE, WHAT WE'REABLE TO DO IS SEE SOMEONE
THAT CAN CUT THROUGH THATGRIDLOCK LIKE A KNIFE
THROUGH BUTTER AND THAT ISONE OF THE DELICIOUS ASPECTS
OF THE SHOW.
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY GETSTHINGS DONE.
>> Stephen: OKAY THAT IS THEFANTASY PART OF THE SHOW.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHAT I AM MOSTLYSEEING--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: OF COURSE THE
OTHER FANTASY PART OF THESHOW IS THAT HE IS A WHITE
DEMOCRAT FROM MY HOME STATEOF NORTH CAROLINA.
>> JOHN SPRATT.
>> Stephen: EATS NO FAT.
>> HE IS A SOUTHERN DEMOCRATWHO REPRESENTED THE FIFTH
DISTRICT.
>> Stephen: WAS, THE WORDIS WAS.
>> THAT'S TRUE, WAS, FOROVER 20 YEARS.
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WEMADE FRANK A SOUTHERN
DEMOCRAT IS BECAUSE IT'S NOTSOME OF ABOUT IDEOLOGY FOR
SOUTHERN DEMOCRAT, IT'SABOUT PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIPS.
>> Stephen: SO ANYWAY, HEAND HIS WIFE ROBIN WRIGHT
THERE, THEY'RE BOTH, YOUKNOW, JUST COLD-BLOODED IN
THEIR PURSUIT OF POWER.
WHO ARE THEY BASED ON IN THEDEMOCRATIC PARTY?
ARE THEY-- ARE THEY BASED ONBILL AND HILLARY OR ARE THEY
BASED ON HILLARY AND BILL?
>> Stephen: THERE'S GOT TOBE-- I WORKED FOR HILLARY IN
2000 FOR HER FIRST SENATECAMPAIGN AND WORKED, THE
SENATOR FROM NEW YORK CHUCKSCHUMER IN 1998.
AND LOOK, ANYONE WHO GETSELECTED TO SENATE IN NEW
YORK KNOWS WHATROUGH-AND-TUMBLE POLITICS IS
AND CERTAINLY FRANK ANDCLAIRE ARE MASTERS AT THAT
GAME.
>> Stephen: ONE OF THEUNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THIS
SHOW IS THAT OCCASIONALLYUNDERWOOD LOOKS RIGHT INTO
THE CAMERA AND SAYS WHAT ISON HIS MIND.
WHY DOES HE DO THAT?
THAT'S SOMETHING WE STOLEFROM THE BBC VERSION, THEY
STOLE IT FROM A GUY NAMEDSHAKESPEARE, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU HEARD OF HIM, AND WHATTHAT ALLOWS TO YOU DO IS
HAVE DIRECT COMMUNICATIONWITH THE AUDIENCE IT MAKES
THEM COMPLICIT IN HISNEFARIOUS ACTS, THEY BECOME
ACCOMPLICES TO HIS CRIMESAND YOU FIND YOURSELF
ROOTING FOR THIS GUY DESPITEYOURSELF THAT IS WHAT
DRAMATIC TENSION ISINTERESTING TO US.
>> Stephen: AT THIS POINT IKNEW I HAD HIM.
WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE INWASHINGTON LOVE IT SO MUCH,
BECAUSE IT'S ALL THEY TALKABOUT RIGHT NOW I THINK
THEY'RE TRYING TO SEETHEMSELVES IN IT I THINK
THEY WANT TO THINK THATTHEY'RE SEXY AND DANGEROUS.
>> LOOK, THE FACT THATPRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF
TWEETED ABOUT THE SHOWPREVIOUS TO THE SECOND
SEASON RELEASE SAYING NOSPOILERS --
>> HUGE DEAL.
AND WHEN WE WERE THERE FORTHE WHITE HOUSE.
>> WHEN WE -->> YEAH, I MEAN ON THE ONE
HAND I AM THINKING YOU KNOW,13 HOURS IS A BIG CHUNK OF
YOUR DAY.
>> I KNOW, EXACTLY.
>> WE GOT THE RUSSIANSROLLING INTO CRIMEA AND HE'S
NOT RESPONDING BECAUSE HE'SBINGE WATCHING YOUR SHOW
RIGHT NOW.
>> YEAH.
>> THANKS A LOT.
>> I THINK, I THINK THAT YOUKNOW THE REASON WASHINGTON
HAS RESPONDED SO WELL, WETAKE GREAT EFFORT TO BE AS
AUTHENTIC AS POSSIBLE.
WE HAVE A DARK EXAGGERATEDVIEW OF DC.
NOT EVERYONE OUT THERE IS ACOLD BLOODED KILLER.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINKTHERE ARE THINGS THAT
POLITICIANS CAN LEARN FROMWATCHING YOUR SHOW, CAN
OBAMA LEARN ANYTHING FROMWATCHING YOUR SHOW OTHER
THAN WATCH OUT FOR YOUR VICEPRESIDENT.
>> WELL, THE WAY THAT FRANKOPERATES IS HE BELIEVES THE
IDEOLOGY IS QUICKSAND ITDOESN'T ALLOW YOU ANY
FLEXIBILITIES.
COMPROMISE HAS BECOME ANAUGHTY WORD IN WASHINGTON.
BUT COMPROMISE IS WHAT GOODGOVERNANCE IS ALL ABOUT.
AND WHEN YOU ARE STUCK INYOUR OWN IDEOLOGY, ARE YOU
NOT WILLING TO MOVE TOWARDSTHE MIDDLE, THEN NOTHING CAN
BE ACCOMPLISHED.
FRANK WILL DO ANYTHING HENEED ITS TO IN ORDER TO GET
SOMETHING DONE IN THOSETHIRD EPISODE OF SEASON TWO
WE HAVE A POTENTIALGOVERNMENT FREEZE OR
SHUTDOWN.
AND YOU KNOW, THEREPUBLICANS WON'T BUDGE, THE
DEMOCRATS WON'T BUDGE.
HE GOES LET'S GIVE THEREPUBLICANS EVERYTHING THEY
WANT.
SO HE SAYS LET'S RAISE THEAGE OF RETIREMENT.
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN AFLUMMOX ABOUT THIS BUT HE
SAYS IF WE ARE ABLE TO GIVEWHAT THEY WANT WE WILL GIVE
WHAT WE WANT.
THAT'S [BLEEP] THOUGH.
>> Stephen: BEAU, THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR JOINING ME, BEAU
WILLIMON, HOUSE OF CARDS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
