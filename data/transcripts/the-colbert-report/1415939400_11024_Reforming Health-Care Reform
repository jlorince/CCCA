(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THEREPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I AM ALWAYS -- YOU KNOWME.
YOU WATCH THIS SHOW.
I'M NOT PROUD.
I'M NOT PROUD.
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!" )
>> Stephen: OH, I CAN'T FIGHTTHAT.
BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOUWATCH THIS SHOW, I'M NOT A
PRIDEFUL MAN.
I ALWAYS AM THE FIRST TO ADMITWHEN I'M WRONG, AND ONCE AGAIN,
I AM RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
THIS TIME IT'S ABOUT OBAMACARE.
FOLKS, I'VE NEVER LIKED IT.
FIRST, THEY PUT A BUREAUCRATBETWEEN AND YOU YOUR DOCTOR, AND
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEDOCTOR AND THE BUREAUCRAT ARE
HANGING OUT ALL THE TIME ANDCONVENIENTLY FORGET TO CALL
YOU THE NIGHT THEY WANT TO GOSEE "INTERSTELLAR," AND YOU
HEARD THEY HAD SUCH A GREATTIME, THEY EVEN HAD A BEER
AFTERWARDS TO TALK ABOUT THEMOVIE.
THANKS, OBAMA.
( LAUGHTER )LUCKILY, THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN
POWER NOW, AND THEY'RE GOING TODO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BY UNDOING
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
>> REPUBLICANS DOMINATE STATEGOVERNMENTS THIS TIME AROUND,
ALSO EAGER TO FIX OBAMACARE.
>> THERE ARE SOME CHANGES TOOBAMACARE THAT I THINK BOTH
PARTIES CAN AGREE TO.
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOWTHAT WE HAVE IDEAS, THAT WE ARE
GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION ANDTRY TO FIX OBAMACARE.
>> Stephen: YES, AFTER MORETHAN 50 VOTES AGAINST OBAMACARE,
THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS NOWPROMISING TO FIX THE LAW.
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU TRY TO MURDERSOMEONE 50 TIMES, AND IT DOESN'T
WORK, SO YOU BUY THEM A GYMMEMBERSHIP.
AND THEY HAVE A GREAT STARTINGPOINT FOR HEALTH CARE
REFORM-REFORM.
>> WE'LL TAKE ON OBAMACAREREGULATIONS THAT THREATEN THE
40-HOUR WORK WEEK.
>> LET'S PUT ON HIS DESK THINGSLIKE RESTORE THE 40-HOUR WORK
WEEK.
>> THE LOSS OF 40-HOUR WORKWEEK, BIG, BIG, MISTAKE.
THAT OUGHT TO BE RESTORED.
>> WE MUST TAKE ACTION ANDRESTORE THE TRADITIONAL 40-HOUR
WORK WEEK.
>> Stephen: YES, RESTORE THETRADITIONAL FOUR-HOUR WORK WEEK
AS GOD INTENDED WHEN HE CLOCKEDOUT AT FIVE WHETHER OR NOT THE
OCEANS WERE DONE.
THAT'S WHY FLOUNDERS LOOK SOWEIRD.
CONGRESS MIGHT NOT HAVE TO FIXTHIS WRECK BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE
WRECKED ITSELF.
>> OPPONENTS OF OBAMACARE HAVEANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, "I
TOLD YOU SO."
>> THE INCENDIARY REMARKS BY ONEOF OBAMACARE'S CHIEF ARCHITECTS,
M.I.T. ECONOMICS PROFESSORJONATHAN GRUBER.
>> IF YOU MADE IT EXPLICIT THATHEALTHY PEOPLE PAY IN AND
SICK PEOPLE GET MONEY IT WOULDNOT HAVE PASSED.
>> HE CLAIMS OBAMACARE WASINTENTIONALLY WRITTEN IN A
TORTURED WAY TO HIDE THE TAXESTHAT WOULD HAVE KILLED THE BILL.
>> Stephen: A-HA!
I KNEW IT.
OBAMACARE IS FUNDED BY TAXES,UNLIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE F-35FIGHTER JET PROGRAM IS PAID FOR
WITH CANDY SALES.
( LAUGHTER )AND JUST LISTEN TO WHY THEY
THOUGHT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITHTHIS.
>> LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS AHUGE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, AND
BASICALLY, CALL IT THE STUPIDITYOF THE AMERICAN VOTER OR
WHATEVER, BUT BASICALLY, THATWAS REALLY, READY CRITICAL TO
GET THE THING TO PASS.
>> Stephen: THE STUPIDITY OFTHE AMERICAN VOTER.
PROFESSOR GRUBER JUST DELIVEREDA DEATH BLOW TO OBAMACARE IN
WHAT I'M CALLING THE "ZA-GRUBERFILM."
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE OUTTHERE WHO IS OFFENDED.
JUST ASK SOUTH CAROLINACONGRESSMAN AND GUY WHO PUT HIS
WIG ON BACKWARDS .
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )TREY GOWDY.
>> I WOULD SAY THIS TO THE-- TOTHE PROFESSOR.
PUT DOWN THE COGNAC, AND THELOST WRITINGS OF J.D. SALINGER.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW STUPIDOUR FELLOW CITIZENS ARE, TAKE A
LOOK AT LAST TUESDAY NIGHT.
>> Stephen: YES, IF YOU WANTTO SEE HOW STUPID AMERICANS ARE,
JUST LOOK AT WHO THEY ELECTEDLAST TUESDAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )IN YOUR FACE.
THESE ARE SMART GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WASTING TIMEON SALINGER'S LOST STORIES?
THE ONLY GOOD ONE IS "A GIRL IKNEW."
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT THROUGH"HAPWORTH 16" YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED SOMETHING STRONGER THANCOGNAC.
OF COURSE, I DON'T HAVE TO TELLYOU, DEMOCRATS ARE.
MANIPULATIVE ELITISTS. FOX WILLDO IT FOR ME.
>> THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF GETTINGTHIS PASSED WAS ALL PREDICATED
ON MANIPULATING, LYING TO THEAMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY
KNEW THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSEDANY OTHER WAY.
>> THEY NEW EXWOOU THIS KIND OFSTUFF THE WHOLE TIME, THEY GIEW
EXWOOU IT, AND THEY AGREED WITHGRUBER THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF
THING YOU COULD TALK ABOUTPUBLICLY BECAUSE IT WOULD KILL
THE BILL.
>> DO YOU THINK THEY GAVE ARAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY DON'T CARE. THEY GOT WHATTHEY WANTED.
>> Stephen: YES! CONTEMPTUOUSDEMOCRATS LOOKED DOWN ON
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THEIRIVORY TOWERS
AND THOUGHT WHAT A PATHETICHORDE OF DULLARDS.
LET'S GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE.
WHEREAS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )IT'S SHAMEFUL.
IT'S SHAMEFUL.
FOR SHAME.
WHEREAS, REPUBLICANS RESPECTEDTHE VOTERS' INTELLIGENCE BY
TELLING THEM THE DEATH PANELSWOULD GRIND UP YOUR GRANDMA TO
MAKE GLUE.
AND PROFESSOR NUMB NUTS HEREWASN'T EVEN THE WORST THING TO
HAPPEN TO OBAMACARE THIS WEEK,BECAUSE ON FRIDAY THE SUPREME
COURT AGREED TO HEAR YET ANOTHERLEGAL CHALLENGE THAT COULD KILL
THE LAW.
IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING-- THEWHEELS OF JUSTICE GRIND SLOWLY,
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'LL RUN OVERSICK PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, THE LAST TWO TIMES I
DECLARED OBAMACARE DEAD, IDROPPED BALLOONS, AND TWERKED ON
THE GRIM REAPER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
BUT, FOLKS, LOOKING BACK--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOOKING BACK, I THINK THAT WAS ALITTLE IMMATURE.
SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GONNA SLOWDANCE.
