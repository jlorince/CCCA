>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
PLEASE.
NATION, YOU KNOW THAT ANY OLD
DOG CAN BE HOUSE-BROKEN, BUT AN
ALPHA DOG WILL BREAK YOUR HOUSE
RIGHT BACK.
THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE
WEEK.
[BARKING]
THIS WEEK'S ALPHA DOG IS
AMERICAN HERO DAVID H. BROOKS.
[BARKING]
FORMER C.E.O. OF D.H.B.
INDUSTRIES, A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR
THAT MAKES BODY ARMOUR FOR THE
U.S. MILITARY, WHO DESCRIBES
HIMSELF ON HIS OWN WEB SITE AS
"DAVID H. BROOKS, THE MAN, THE
MYTH, THE LEGENDARY
HUMANITARIAN."
NOW, IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC
TIMES, YOU MIGHT THINK A MAN WHO
PROFITS OFF WAR WOULD KEEP THE
EXTRAVAGANT SPENDING TO A
MINIMUM, BUT NOT THE BIG DOG,
DAVE BROOKS, WHO IS CURRENTLY ON
TRIAL FOR A $185 MILLION STOCK
FRAUD AND FOR USING MORE THAN $6
MILLION OF OUR TAX MONEY FOR
PERSONAL EXPENSES INCLUDING A
$100,000 AMERICAN FLAG BELT
BUCKLE ENCRUSTED WITH RUBIES,
SAPPHIRES AND DIAMONDS.
WHICH MAKES IT A PATRIOTIC DUTY
TO SALUTE HIS CROTCH.
I ASSUME HE BOUGHT THAT BELT
BUCKLE WITH MONEY HE DIDN'T
SPEND ON IMPROVING HIS
BULLET-PROOF VEST, WHICH WERE
RECALLED IN 2005 ON THE
TECHNICALITY THAT THEY DIDN'T
STOP BULLETS.
OTHER MONEY HE DIDN'T SPEND
IMPROVING THE VEST WENT TOWARDS
A FACELIFT FOR HIS WIFE AND
PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS FOR HIS SON.
ALTHOUGH I SERIOUSLY DOUBT HIS
SON WILL SEE ANYTHING MORE
PORNOGRAPHIC THAN HIS FATHER
[BLEEPED] OUR TROOPS TO BUY A
FACELIFT FOR HIS MOTHER.
HI HONEY.
HI HONEY.
[APPLAUSE]
SO THAT'S NOT ALL FOR THIS COCKY
SPANIEL BECAUSE BROOKS ALSO USED
OUR MONEY TO HIRE PROSTITUTES
FOR HIS STAFF, WHICH HE USED TO
MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES AND MAKE THEM
MORE PRODUCTIVE, BECAUSE NOTHING
MAKES AN OFFICE SEEM MORE
PRODUCTIVE THAN EVERYONE
SHOUTING HARDER, FASTER.
AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH, IF
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE BROOKS
THE MOST SNIP-WORTHY SACK IN THE
PACK, HE FAMOUSLY THROUGH A $10
MILLION BAT MITZVAH FOR HIS
DAUGHTER THAT FEATURED
PERFORMANCES BY 50 CORRECT, TOM
PETTY, THE EAGLES, STEVIE NICKS,
AEROSMITH AND KENNY G, YOU KNOW,
ALL THE MUSICIANS A 13-YEAR-OLD
GIRL LOVES.
AND IT'S PERFECT FOR A BAT
MITZVAH, BECAUSE NOTHING TURNS A
GIRL INTO A WOMAN FASTER THAN
LEAVING HER ALONE WITH STEVEN
TYLER.
BUT, BUT... THAT'S A
GOOD-LOOKING LADY.
NOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, NONE OF
THIS IS WHY BROOKS IS MY SUPER
THAT NEWSER.
WHAT CLINCHED IT WAS WHEN HE
REALIZED HIS FORMER C.F.O. DON
SLAGLE MIGHT TESTIFY AGAINST
HIM.
HE DIDN'T TAKE THE EASY ROAD OR
BRIBE HER OR HAVE HER MURDERED.
THAT'S FOR PUSSIES.
BROOKS WENT TO HIS RACEHORSE
VETERINARIAN AND DEMANDED A
MEMORY ERASING PILL.
NOW LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.
BROOKS ASSUMES HIS VETERINARIAN
IS GIVING HIS HORSES
MEMORY-ERASING PILLS.
THAT MEANS HE MUST HAVE BEEN
DOING SOMETHING TO HIS HORSES
THAT IS SO UNSPEAKABLE THAT THE
ONLY REASON THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO
THE AUTHORITIES IS THAT THEIR
MEMORIES HAVE BEEN CHEMICALLY
ERASED.
THE POINT IS ANY OLD PUP CAN
HAVE A WITNESS BOUGHT OFF OR
BUMPED OFF, BUT FOR TAKING A
GREAT DANE SIZED WHIZ ON THE
TAXPAYERERS' LEGS AND DEMANDING
AN IMAGINARY PILL THAT WOULD
HIDE THE FACT YOU HAD HOOKERS
AND
