>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN "JOHN CARTER," A NEW SIGH TIE MOVIE
ABOUT A CIVIL WAR SOLDIER WHO GOES TO MARS.
I KNEW THE CIVIL WAR WASN'T ABOUT SLIVERY.
PLEASE WELCOME WILLEM DEFOE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. DEFOE, THANKS SO MUCH.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
GOD, I'M TORN IS WHAT I GOT TO SAY.
I'M ABSOLUTELY TORN TO HAVE YOU HERE.
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING CAREER.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WERE IN PLATOON, WHAT A PERFORMANCE, INCREDIBLE.
SHADOW OF VAMPIRE, SPIDER-MAN,
FINDING NEEMO, LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.
YOU ARE NOT FORGIVING.
OKAY.
YOU WANT... IF YOU'RE HERE FOR FORGIVENESS, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
>> OKAY.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL MAD AT YOU ABOUT THAT ONE?
>> LAST TIME I CHECKED, IT KIND OF GOES AWAY.
>> Stephen: NOT HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
LIKE MOST CHRISTIANS, I HOLD A GRUDGE.
NOW, SIR, YOUR NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "JOHN CARTER."
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
YOU PLAY A NINE-FOOT-TALL ALIEN WITH FOUR ARMS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A METHOD ACTOR, RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
HOW DO YOU PREPARE FAR NINE-FOOT-FOUR ARMED ALIEN?
DO YOU A RIDE ALONG WITH WHAT?
>> IT'S CALLED MOTION CAPTURE.
YOU GET A LITTLE HELP FROM ANIMATORS.
>> LIKE PING PONG BALLS ON YOUR BODY.
>> PARTLY THAT.
ALSO WE ACTUALLY FILMED ALL THE SCENES BECAUSE...
>> Stephen: ON MARS?
>> YEAH, UTAH, MARS.
>> Stephen: HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> AMAZINGLY SIMILAR.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO DID YOU ACTUALLY DO IT IN A FIELD WITH THE STUFF ON YOUR BODY OR WERE YOU IN A BIG GROAN ROOM?
>> ALWAYS ON LOCATION.
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING TO ME ANYWAY WAS STILTS.
I HAD TO WEAR STILLS TO GIVE ME THE RIGHT HEIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU WERE ACTUALLY WEARING...
>> WHICH IS GREAT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE READY TO PLAY UNCLE SAM IN A PARADE NOW.
THINK ABOUT IMENT THINK ABOUT IT.
>> OKAY.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF THE MOVIE.
JIM, CAN WE?
SHOW THE MAGIC.
>> YOU'VE GOT ME.
I SURRENDER.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
>> CAPTAIN JOHN CARTER,
VIRGINIA.
>> VIRGINIA.
VIRGINIA.
>> NO.
MY NAME IS JOHN CARTER.
I'M FROM VIRGINIA.
>> VIRGINIA.
LAUGHTER LAUGH
>> Stephen: I BELIEVE YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
IS THAT CHARACTER BASED ON ANYBODY, THAT CHARACTER?
ANYBODY, LIKE ERICK ERICKSON OR CHRIS CHRISTIE?
WHO IS TARS TARKUS BASED ON BECAUSE HE EVENTUALLY STARTS SPEAKING ENGLISH.
>> THERE IS A THING CALLED A SCRIPT AND A THING CALLED CAN BOOK THAT IT'S BASED ON AND
THAT'S WHAT I WORKED FROM.
>> Stephen: SO YOU HAD TO LEARN LIKE ANOTHER LANGUAGE.
IS THERE A MS TARKUS, A TIFFANY TARKU SU ANYWHERE OUT THERE?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GOT TO SEE THE MOVIE.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, HAVE YOU.
YOU READ YOUR SCENES AND YOU WENT HOME.
OKAY.
AS I SAID BEFORE, THE PERFORMANCE IN PLATOON WAS INCREDIBLE.
I SAW THAT AS A YOUNG MAN.
I WAS INCREDIBLY AFFECTING.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT MOMENT AT THE END WHERE YOU FALL TO YOUR KNEES AND YOUR ARMS GO UP IN AN
INCREDIBLY TRAGIC MOMENT.
DO FANS EVER COME UP TO YOU ON THE STREET AND SAY, "DO THE ARM THING"?
>> A LITTLE BIT.
>> Jon: BECAUSE AFTER THIS,
THAT TARS TARKUS GUY, IMAGINE HOW SAD AND AFFECTING THAT WOULD BE?
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO ASK ALL THE ACTORS THAT COME ON
MY SHOW, ARE YOU, SIR, ARE YOU A MOVIE STAR OR ARE YOU AN ACTOR?
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE EITHER ONE,
BUT DON'T YOU BE MISTAKEN ABOUT IT.
>> I DON'T GET ANY OTHER CHOICES?
>> Stephen: NO.
I'LL HELP YOU OUT HERE.
DO YOU WAIT TABLES FOR A A LIVING?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR.
[APPLAUSE]
WELL, WILLEM DEFOE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BY THE WAY, DOES ANYBODY CALL YOU WILL?
>> UH, NO.
>> Stephen: BILL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WILLEM DEFOE, "JOHN CARTER," IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
