OKAY.
LET'S MOVE ON.
FOLKS, TODAY IS THE FIRST
MONDAY IN OCTOBER.
THE SEASON-OPENER OF MY
FAVORITE SPORT, SUPREME
COURTING.
NOW SOME SAY IT'S NOT
ACTUALLY A SPORT BUT I SAY
IT'S GOT A COURT LIKE
BASKETBALL, AS MUCH
EXCITEMENT AS BASEBALL AND
MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN
HOCKEY.
AND AS FOR ALL SPORTS, I
HAVE MADE MY FAMOUS NINE
LAYER DIP.
ONE LAYER, ONE LAYER FOR
EACH JUSTICE, ALTHOUGH THE
THOMAS LAYER AND THE SCALIA
LAYER TASTE EXACTLY THE
SAME.
AND FOLKS, I AM, I THINK
THAT WAS NOT REFRIGERATED.
AND-- I AM PUMPED.
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
ETHICS CASES COMING UP THIS
SEASON.
SECV FOX TELEVISION.
FOX IS DEFENDING
BROADCASTING EXPLETIVES
DURING THE BILLBOARD AWARDS.
EXPLETIVES LIKE WHAT THE
[BLEEP] ARE THE BILLBOARD
AWARDS.
BUT FOLKS, BLEEPING
EXPLETIVES.
LET'S BLEEP THAT OUT,
OKAYMENT BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS
THE BIG MATCHUP ON THE
SCHEDULE.
>> OMO BAMACARE HEADED FOR
THE SUPREME COURT.
>> OBAMACARE, IS IT
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> THE SUPREME COURT MIGHT
RULE.
>> THE CHALLENGE TO THE
PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW
OFFICIALLY REACHES THE
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND.
>> YES, THESE NINE JUSTICES
COULD KILO BAMACARE.
I TOLD YOU THERE WERE DEATH
PANEL-- PANELS.
NOW FOLKS, THE HEART OF THIS
CASE IS THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE.
WHICH WILL REQUIRE ALL
UNINSURED AMERICANS TO
PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE.
AND THE ONLY PREEXISTING
CONDITION THAT WILL CURE IS
LIBERTY.
>> JIM?
>> WHEN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT CAN TELL ANY
AMERICAN THAT THEY
CAN-- THAT THEY MUST AS A
CONDITION OF CITIZENSHIP
PURCHASE A PRODUCT OR
SERVICE, THEY WILL BECOME A
DICTATOR OVER OUR LIVES.
>> CONGRESS HAS NEVER
CROSSED THE LINE BETWEEN
REGULATING WHAT PEOPLE
CHOOSE TO DO, AND ORDERING
THEM TO DO IT.
>> NEVER BEFORE IN THE 225
YEAR HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY
HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
SAID YOU HAD TO BUY
ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: YES, THE
GOVERNMENT CANNOT FORCE YOU
TO BUY THINGS.
IT CAN ONLY TAX YOU, DRAFT
YOU, SEIZE AND SELL YOUR
PROPERTY, ARREST YOU,
INCARCERATE YOU AND EXECUTE
YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT IT CANNOT
CANNOT-- FOLKS, IT CANNOT
TELL YOU TO BUY INSURANCE.
ONLY A GEKKO CAN DO THAT.
THE SUPREME COURT HAS GOT TO
KILL THIS THING.
ALLEGED CANADA JOHN HUNTSMAN
EXPLAINS.
>> A $1 TRILLION BOMB THAT
OBAMACARE MEANS TO THIS
COUNTRY OVER TEN YEARS, IS
CREATING SUCH UNCERTAINTY IN
THE MARKETPLACE.
>> Stephen: YES, IT IS
CREATING UNCERTAINTY, BEFORE
OBAMACARE WE HAD CERTAINTY.
WE WERE CERTAIN THAT 45
MILLION AMERICANS WERE
UNINSURED.
AND THAT CERTAINTY WAS GREAT
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE
FUNERAL HOMES AND HEADSTONE
CARVERS.
AND FOLKS, THIS CASE IS
GOING TO BE A REAL
NAIL-BITER WHICH IS FINE
