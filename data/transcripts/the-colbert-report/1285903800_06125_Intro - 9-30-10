>> Stephen: TONIGHT, ARE
ROBOTS BECOMING TOO HUMAN, AND
WILL OUR MICROWAVES SOON HAVE A
SETTING FOR LOVE?
THEN HOW RELIABLE ARE POLLS?
I'LL INTERRUPT YOUR DINNER TO
ASK WHAT YOU THINK.
AND MY GUEST IS "WEST WING"
CREATOR AARON SORKIN.
WE'LL WALK AND TALK IN THE HALL
WHILE PEOPLE HAND US STUFF.
IT'S THE FOURTH DAY OF BANNED
BOOK WEEK.
OR THE THIRD.
I DON'T KNOW.
THE FIRST BANNED BOOK WAS MY DAY
PLANNER.
