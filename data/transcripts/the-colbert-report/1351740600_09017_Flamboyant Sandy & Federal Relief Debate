TO DISASTER-PROM!
FOLKS, NONE OF THIS SURPRISES ME.
NONE OF IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NONE OF THIS SURPRISES ME.
HURRICANES HAVE A WELL-KNOWN LIBERAL BIAS.
FIRST KATRINA TAINTED GEORGE BUSH'S PRESIDENCY.
THEN ISAAC WIPED OUT THE FIRST DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.
NOW HURRICANE SANDY.
SANDY, WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT?
ARE YOU A DUDE STORM OR A LADY STORM?
OH, BIG SURPRISE, JUST WHEN OBAMA NEEDS A BOOST, WHO SHOWS UP BUT A GENDER-AMBIGUOUS WEATHER SYSTEM, A CATEGORY 5 BY
CURE CANE.
(LAUGHTER) HEY, HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I DON'T MINE YOU BEING A HEMISPHERIC SCALE METEOROLOGICAL EVENT, BUT WHY MUST YOU BE SO
FLAMBOYANT AND IN MY FACE ABOUT IT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO, I'M HURRICANE SANDY, DEAL WITH ME!
NOW, MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS, THE HURRICANE AGENDA IS TO MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOK NECESSARY!
(LAUGHTER) WELL, MITT ROMNEY UNDERSTANDS THAT DISASTER RELIEF BELONGS ONLY ON THE STATE LEVEL.
AS HE EXPLAINED WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR FEMA DURING A PRIMARY DEBATE.
>> EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN OCCASION TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SEND IT BACK TO THE STATES, THAT'S
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
AND IF YOU GO EVEN FURTHER AND SEND IT BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THAT'S EVEN BETTER.
>> Stephen: RIGHT!
WE SHOULD MAKE DISASTER RELIEF THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATES.
WHO BETTER TO RESPOND TO WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ITS OWN BORDERS THAN THE STATE WHOSE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS JUST BEEN
SWEPT OUT TO SEA?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO PLEASE, PLEASE FOLKS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S BAD,
BUT LET'S NOT FREAK OUT OVER HURRICANE SANDY AND THINK WE NEED THE FEDS!
THE| RESPONSE SHOULD SIMPLY BE HANDLED BY WHATEVER INDIVIDUAL STATE IS THE ENTIRE EASTERN SEA BOARD.
(LAUGHTER) AND IN A ROMNEY ADMINISTRATION INSTEAD OF DEPENDING ON BIG GOVERNMENT YOU'LL BE RESCUED BY
PRIVATE-SECTOR VOLUNTEERS LIKE PAUL RYAN WHO WILL PERSONALLY COME TO YOUR DEVASTATED TOWN AND WASH YOUR ALREADY-CLEAN POTS.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
