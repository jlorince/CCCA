SPEAKING OF SECOND PLACE
SARAH PALIN.
[LAUGHTER]
THE FORMER HALF-GOVERNOR SHOOK
UP THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THIS
WEEKEND, LAUNCHING.
HER "ONE NATION" BUS TOUR
VISITING OUR NATION'S HISTORIC
SITES.
OF COURSE, THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA
AMBUSHED PALIN WITH GOTCHA
QUESTIONS LIKE "WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?" AND "WHY ARE YOU DOING
THIS?"
[LAUGHTER]
JIM?yM
>> WHAT'S UP WITH HER BUS TOUR?
>> SARAH PALIN KEEPS EVERYBODY
GUESSING ON HER NATIONAL TOUR.
>> JUST WHAT IS SARAH PALIN UP
TO?
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE POWER OF
SARAH PALIN.
NO MATTER WHAT SHE DOES AMERICA
STARTS ASKING "WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING?"
[LAUGHTER]
BESIDES HER WEBSITE EXPLAINS
THAT SHE HAS RENTED A BUS
"TO PROMOTE THE FUNDAMENTAL
RESTORATION OF AMERICA."
[LAUGHTER]
AFTER STOPPING AT MOUNT VERNON
PALIN WROTE:
EVEN PIPER WAS ABLE TO GRASP THE

PRESENCE OF OUR FIRST PRESIDENT
WHO HAD SUCH DIVERSE INTERESTS -
WHEN SHE TOLD ME LATER "HOW HARD
HE MUST HAVE WORKED TO KEEP THAT

I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD HE
WORKED WITH NO HELP OTHER THAN

SO, FOLKS --

WHERE YOU CAN HELP RESTORE
AMERICA.
AND ALSO RESTORE SARAH PALIN'S
BANK ACCOUNT.
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING THAT
POPS UP IS THIS DONATE BUTTON.
WON'T YOU HELP SARAH PALIN LEARN
BASIC FACTS ABOUT U.S. HISTORY
FOR JUST PENNIES A DAY?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW LIKE GOVERNISH PALIN, I WANT
TO USE MY PAC.
COLBERT SUPER PAC, TO TAKE MY
KIDS ON A FOR-PROFIT VACATION.
BUT I CAN'T FORM MY PAC YET
BECAUSE I'M STILL WAITING FOR
THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
TO RULE ON THE ADVISORY OPINION
REQUEST I FILED TWO WEEKS AGO
AT THE FEC ASKING WHETHER I CAN
HAVE A TV SHOW AND MY PAC AND
NOT HAVE TO
REVEAL WHERE, YOU KNOW, SOME OF
THE MONEY'S COMING FROM.
NOW SOME HAVE SAID THE FEC
SHOULDN'T TAKE MY REQUEST
SERIOUSLY.
YOU KNOW WHO DISAGREES?
THE FEC BECAUSE I HAVE RECEIVED
THIS ACTUAL LIST OF THIRTEEN
QUESTIONS FROM THE FEC.
NOW THESE ARE COMPLICATED LEGAL
QUESTIONS, SO I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN
IT CAME TO TESTS: PAY A SMART
KID TO SIT NEXT TO ME AND GIVE
