( LAUGHTER )I WILL NOT BE AMBUSHED!
BUT THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
YOU HAVE WON THE PULITZER PRIZEAND THE NOBEL PRIZE IN
LITERATURE.
THAT IS LIKE THE ROCK 'N' ROLLHALL OF FAME OF BOOKS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THEBOOKS YOU HAVE WRITTEN.
"THE BLUEST EYE."
"BELOVED."
"SONG OF SOLOMON," "SULA," AMONGOTHERS.
WHAT IS THE WEIGHT YOU FEEL, ORIS THERE ANY WEIGHT, ANY BURDEN
BEING A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER INLITERATURE?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S-- THAT'SHEMINGWAY.
THAT'S DORIS LESSING, THAT'SYOU.
DO YOU FEEL WORTHY?
( LAUGHTER )>> I KNOW THAT MY BOOKS ARE
WORTHY.
WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM ME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND THAT'S-- THAT'S THE PARTTHAT I REALLY RELISH, THAT PART.
NO, I-- ACTUALLY, I READ"BELOVED" A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
>> Stephen: YOUR OWN BOOK.
YOU READ YOUR OWN BOOK.
>> I READ MY BOOK.
>> Stephen: HAD YOU READ ITSINCE YOU WROTE IT?
>> NO. I NEVER READ THEM AFTERI FINISH THEM
UNLESS I'M READING IT PUBLICLYWHEN SOMEONE SAYS "WOULD YOU
READ PART OF YOUR BOOK?" BUT IREAD IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
>> Stephen: AND?
>> IT'S REALLY GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen: BRAVA.
THAT IS GREAT.
I'M A HUGE FAN OF MY WORK,TOO.
WERE YOU SURPRISED HOW GOOD YOURBOOK WAS?
>> AT THAT TIME, I MEAN, IT'SBEEN YEARS-- WHAT, 80s OR
SOMETHING?
WHEN WAS THAT BOOK PUBLISHED?
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER READ ANYTHING YOU'VEWRITTEN.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I THINK IT WAS IN THE 80s.
BUT SOMEONE SENT ME A COPY ANDSAID WOULD I AUTOGRAPH IT AND I
WAS LOOKING FOR A PAGE AND IHAPPENED TO OPEN IT UP AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE BOOK.
AND I LOOKED DOWN, AND THEREWERE THESE SENTENCES, THESE
INCREDIBLE, BEAUTIFUL, LYRIC,STRAIGHT AND POWERFUL SENTENCES.
SO I JUST KEPT READING.
IT HAD BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME.
>> Stephen: WAS THERE ANYPOINT IN READING YOUR OWN POINT
THAT YOU THOUGHT I WOULD HAVEDONE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.
I REALLY SHANKED THAT SENTENCE.
WOULD YOU TEMPTED TO DO AREWRITE AT ALL?
>> THERE ARE BOOKS I THINK ICOULD DO A LITTLE BIT OVER.
THE FIRST BOOK I WROTE, "THEBLUEST EYE", IS ONE OF THE BOOKS
WHERE I THINK I MADE A FAIRLYSUBSTANTIAL MISTAKE IN NOT
DOING JUSTICE TO ONE OF THECHARACTERS.
IT WAS A CHARACTER I DIDN'TLIKE.
IT WAS A KIND OF -->> Stephen:  WELL, THAT WILL
DO IT.
( LAUGHTER )AND I NEVER PAID HER CLOSE
ATTENTION.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE SAID YOUDON'T NECESSARILY LIKE TO BE
PIGEONHOLED AS AN AFRICANAMERICAN WRITER.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TOPIGEONHOLE YOU AS?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO CATEGORIZEEVERYBODY.
DO YOU WANT TO BE, YOU KNOW,PIGEONHOLED AS A KOREAN POP
STAR?
HOW SHOULD I SEE YOU AS ACATEGORY?
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ANAFRICAN AMERICAN WRITER, HOW
SHOULD I THINK OF YOU?
>> AS AN AMERICAN WRITER.
>> Stephen: AS AN AMERICANWRITER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YOU THINK I'M-- I DON'T-- I-- IDON'T SEE RACE.
OKAY.
I'VE-- I'VE EVOLVED BEYONDRACISM, ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T SEE RACE.
I DON'T EVEN SEE MY OWN.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND IBELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
READ ANY OF YOUR BOOKS.
( LAUGHTER )CAN I, AS A WHITE MAN,
UNDERSTAND THE AFRICAN AMERICANEXPERIENCE?
>> YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHINGABOUT RACISM.
>> Stephen: BUT THEN, WOULDN'TI BE A RACIST IF I THOUGHT ABOUT
RACISM?
>> PERHAPS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTTHAN THAT IS THERE IS NO SUCH
THING AS RACE.
NONE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THERE'S JUST THE HUMAN RACE,SCIENTIFICALLY,
ANTHROPOLOGICALLY, RACISM IS ACONSTRUCT, A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT.
AND IT HAS BENEFITS.
IT HAS MONEY-- MONEY CAN BE MADEOFF OF IT.
AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKETHEMSELVESES CAN FEEL BETTER
BECAUSE OF IT.
IT CAN DESCRIBE CERTAIN KIND OFBEHAVIOR THAT ARE WRONG OR
MISLEADING.
SO IT HAS A SOCIAL FUNCTION,RACISM.
BUT RACE CAN ONLY BE DEFINED ASA HUMAN BEING.
>> Stephen: OK, SO --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen: OBAMA HAS SAID
READING YOUR BOOK "THE SONG OFSOLOMON" TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BE.
>> TRUE, HE DID SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: IF YOU TAUGHT HIMHOW TO BE, ARE YOU PARTIALLY TO
BLAME FOR OBAMACARE?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TOANYBODY?
>> I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITYFOR OBAMACARE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: OK WE CAN CALL IT -->> TONI-CARE.
>> Stephen: TONI-CARE, THAT'SVERY NICE.
>> VERY GOOD.
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T WRITEYOUR FIRST NOVEL UNTIL YOU WERE
39, CORRECT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS YOUR ENTIRELITERARY CAREER A MIDLIFE
CRISIS?
( LAUGHTER ).
>>UN, THAT'S A GOOD NAME FOR IT.
ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: A MIDLIFE CRISIS?
>> YEAH, SOME KIND OF CRISISWHERE YOU JUST UP AND CHANGE.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT EVERYTHINGIN THE WORLD THAT I WANTED TO
READ HAD BEEN WRITTEN.
AND THEN IN MY 30s, I WANTEDSOMETHING ELSE.
I WANTED TO SHOW HOW PAINFULTHIS CONSTRUCTED, HORRIBLE
RACISM WAS ON THE MOSTVULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY--
GIRLS, BLACK GIRLS, POOR GIRLS--AND THAT IT REALLY AND TRULY
COULD HURT YOU.
SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORAND NO ONE, I THOUGHT, HAD
WRITTEN THAT BOOK.
SO SINCE I REALLY WANTED TO READIT, I THOUGHT I SHOULD WRITE IT.
>> Stephen: AND 25 YEARSLATER, YOU GOT TO READ IT, AND
YOU SAID THAT'S DAMN GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
TONI MORRISON, THANK YOU FORJOINING ME.
