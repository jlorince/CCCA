[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, FOLKS, LAST NIGHT I SHOWED YOU PART ONE OF MY ADVENTURE IN THE WORK-A-DAY WORLD OF HORSE BALLET.
TONIGHT THE THRILLING CONCLUSION, WHICH, IN THE SPIRIT OF NBC'S COVERAGE, WE ACTUALLY
TAPED TEN DAYS AGO.
JIM?
>> LAST NIGHT I SAT DOWN WITH MICHAEL BARAZONE, MEMBER OF THE BEIJING OLYMPIC TEAM AND COACH
FOR THE 2012 LONDON GAMES, WHO TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT DRESSAGE,
ESPECIALLIERS HARDEST DISCIPLINES, PASSAGE OR HORSIE WALKING SIDEWAYS, AND FANCY PRANCING.
I WAS HOOKED.
AND I HAD MY EYES ON THE PRIZE.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO WEAR THAT TIARA?
>> THE TIARAS WERE WON BY MYSELF.
>> THAT'S YOUR TIARA?
>> Stephen: WELL, I WON IT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE SAY DRESSAGE IS AN ELITIST SPORT.
YOU GUYS WEAR TIARAS.
>> IF YOU SUCCEED AT YOUR LESSON TODAY, YOU CAN WEAR THE TIARA.
>> Stephen: THE SPARKLY GAUNTLET WAS THROWN DOWN, SO WE MOSEYED INTO THE STABLES TO
LEARN THE TOOLS OF THE TRADE.
NOW THIS THING, THIS IS NICE.
>> THAT'S A LUNGEING WHIP.
>> Stephen: THIS IS WHEN I LUNGE AT MY HORSE?
>> NEW YORK LUNGE IS WHEN YOU TAKE A YOUNGER HORSE.
EASY, EASY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE REAL DEAL.
THAT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.
DO THE FEMALE HORSES AND THE MALE HORSES EVER DATE?
>> NO.
NO, DATING IS ALL ARRANGED MARRIAGES.
IT'S SELECTIVE ANIMAL BREEDING.
>> Stephen: WE DO THAT AT MY COUNTRY CLUB, TOO.
WE ARRANGE WHAT KIDS CAN DATE EACH OTHER SO WE'LL HAVE A BETTER CROP FOR NEXT YEAR'S SWIM TEAM.
THEN IT WAS TIME TO MEET MY DANCE PARTNER.
>> SO STEPHEN, THIS IS CONCHITA.
>> HELLO, CONCHITA.
NOW, IS THERE ANYWHERE I SHOULD NOT TOUCH THE HORSE?
>> GENERALLY APPROACHING THE HORSE IS ABOUT THE WAY YOU APPROACH HER.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN FRONT OF HER OR WE HIDE HER.
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
THAT'S WHEN SHE KICKS THE SKULL OFF MY SHOULDERS?
>> THE LIKELIHOOD IS ABOUT ZERO.
>> Stephen: IS IT ABOUT ZERO OR IS IT ZERO?
>> THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTES.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU HOLD THE HORSE?
>> I'D BE HAPPY THE HOLD THE HORSE.
>> Stephen: LOVELY TALKING TO YOU.
THEN I REMEMBERED THE TIARA.
EVEN WITHOUT A SKULL, THAT WOULD LOOK GREAT ON MY NECK, SO I SUITED UP.
[APPLAUSE]
AND I PREPARED TO MOUNT MILADY.
>> FIRST THING, GIRTH.
>> Stephen: GIRTH IS IMPORTANT.
SOMETIMES MORE IMPORTANT THAN LENGTH.
OKAY.
NOW, IS THIS HOW YOU START IT?
JUST PULL THIS LIKE A LAWNMOWER.
>> Stephen: CONCHITA, WALK FORWARD.
>> GIVE HER A LITTLE PUSH.
HANDS TOGETHER.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU SAY GIDDY UP IN FRENCH?
>> DON'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE RIDING A HORSE.
>> Stephen: SHOULD BY WEARING A CUP?
BECAUSE I'M NOT.
>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: I AM.
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.
I WORE A CUP IN BASEBALL AS A KID, AND THIS IS LIKE A 1,500-POUND BASEBALL.
>> I DON'T WEAR ONE AN I AM KIND OF ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO BE MORE THAN KIND OF ALL RIGHT.
>> YOU SHOULDN'T SMIRK AND YOU SHOULDN'T FROWN.
>> Stephen: THIS GOOD?
>> THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING TOO GOOD OF A TIME.
>> Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT HAVE PEE-OFFED A LITTLE.
>> YOU HAVEN'T BUT YOU'RE GOING TO.
>> Stephen: I'M PRETTY SURE I PEE OFFED.
I THINK I NEED A TOWEL.
WHO IS WINNING, ME OR THE HORSE?
>> YOU'RE DOING FINE.
>> Stephen: BUT JUST FINE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO GET THE DAZZLING HEADBAND.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET THE TIARA?
>> WE HAVE TO PEEOFF.
>> Stephen: SO AFTER A LIFETIME OF 20 MINUTES OF TRAINING, IT WAS TIME TO ACHIEVE
THE MOST DIFFICULT DISCIPLINE IN ALL OF DRESSAGE.
>> SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN.
LEAN BACK.
RELAX YOUR HANDS.
LEAN BACK.
NOT TOO MUCH.
LITTLE FINGERS CLOSED.
LITTLE FINGERS CLOSED.
LEAN BACK.
LITTLE FINGERS CLOSED.
THE TIARA IS YOURS.
>> Stephen: I PEEOFFED IT.
[APPLAUSE]
WE DRESSAGED.
MICHAEL, TELL ME, CAN I GET OFF NOW?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: OH, CONCHITA.
>> WELL DONE.
>> Stephen: A NOBLE STEED.
I NEED AN ICE PACK FOR MY THIGH PLEASE.
MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME.
>> MY PLEASUREMENT MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: HOPEFULLY TODAY WE HAVE PROVEN THAT DRESSAGE IS THE
SPORT OF JOE SIX PACK OR AT THE VERY LEAST JOE TIARA.
TO REFALCA.
>> AND TEAM U.S.A.
