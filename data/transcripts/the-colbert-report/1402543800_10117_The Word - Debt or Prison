>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, IF I KNOW MY NATION I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ANYBODY
AMERICA'S THE GREATEST NATION ONEARTH. WHY? IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE
GOT THE GREATEST BEST PEOPLE ON EARTH.
THERE'S ME, THERE'S YOU, THELIST GOES  ON.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE GREATESTWORST  PEOPLE ON EARTH
BECAUSE AMERICA  PUTS MORE OFITS CITIZENS IN PRISON
THAN ANY OTHER NATION. WE ARENUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET
ALSO NUMBER ONE WITH AN OUNCE INYOUR POCKET
BUT CONFINING SO MANY AMERICANSCOMES AT A
TERRIBLE PRICE, WHICH IT TURNS OUT IS MONEY.
THE AVERAGE COST OFINCARCERATING A FEDERAL INMATE
IN 2011 WAS ALMOST $29,000.AND IN NEW YORK CITY THE COST
PER INMATE WAS $168,000.  THOUGHA BROKER WILL TELL YOU THAT'S A
PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR A  6 BY 10STUDIO WITH EAT-IN TOILET.
FORTUNATELY THERE'S A WAY TOSHIV SOME OF THOSE COSTS IN THE
KIDNEYS, AND THAT BRINGS USTO TONIGHT'S WORD.
DEBT OR PRISON?
FOLKS, OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS FOUND SO MANY WAYS TO CUT
CORNERS.
FOR INSTANCE, ELIMINATING NONESSENTIALS.
FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNORS IN UTAH, IDAHO, TEXAS, INDIANA AND
ARIZONA HAVE REFUSED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE PRISON RAPE
ELIMINATION ACT. THAT REMINDS MEON AN OLD JOKE.
TWO PRISONERS ARE IN THE SHOWERAND ONE OF THEM DROPS THE SOAP
SO THE OTHER GUY SAYS "WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN IS
FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO PREVENT." BUT THE SAVINGS DON'T
STOP AT NOT PREVENTING SEXUALASSAULT. THERE'S ALSO CHEAP
LABOR. THE NEW YORK TIMESREPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS RELYING ON TENS OF THOUSANDSOF DETAINED IMMIGRANTS TO WORK
IN DETENTION CENTERS COOKINGMEALS, SCRUBBING SHOWERS AND
BUFFING HALLWAYS, USUALLY FOR ADOLLAR A DAY OR LESS.
SOME ARE EVEN PAID WITH JUST CANDY BARS
I KNOW, THAT SOUNDS BAD BUT THEIR NEXT PAYDAY COULD BE A
HUNDRED GRAND. I MEAN, THINKABOUT IT. IT'S WIN-WIN.
IT'S WIN-WIN.
THEY COME TO OUR COUNTRY TO STEAL OUR JOBS SO WE ARREST THEM
AND FORCE THEM TO DO OUR JOBS.
IT CANNOT BE ENOUGH JUST TO SAVEMONEY.
PRISONS NEED TO TURN A PROFIT AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE'RE
WELL ON THE WAY AS REPORTED BY ANOTHER CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE
FINANCED BY TAXPAYERS, N.P.R.
AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION,NIPPER HAS FOUND THAT ACROSS THE
COUNTRY DEFENDANTS CAN BE BILLEDFOR A PUBLIC DEFENDER, FOR
THEIR OWN PROBATION, AND PAROLESUPERVISION
FOR THE ELECTRONIC MONITORINGDEVICES THEY'RE ORDERED TO WEAR
AND EVEN CHARGED ROOM AND BOARDFOR PRISON STAYS. AND THE
BEST PART IS, THESE FEES ARE SELF-SUSTAINING INVESTMENTS.
>> ON A TYPICAL DAY, ABOUT 25%OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY
JAIL ARE THERE NOT FORTHEIR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES
BUT BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO PAYTHE COURT COSTS AND FEES
>> Stephen: IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM.IF THE DEFENDANT CANT PAY THE
FEE, THEY'LL GO TO JAIL WHERETHEY'LL  RACK UP MORE FOOD
AND BOARDING FEES THAT THEYCAN'T PAY AND BE PENALIZED WITH
MORE JAIL TIME, THUS INCREASINGTHEIR DEBT WHICH  GIVES THEM
LONGER PRISON SENTENCES.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, DON'T DOTHE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T DO THE
TIME OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DIME
WHICH IS A CRIME RESULTING INMORE TIME.
AND THESE FEES ARE RESULTING INSERIOUS SENTENCES FOR THE POOR.
A JUDGE IN GEORGIA RECENTLYSENTENCED A MAN TO 12 MONTHS
IN JAIL FOR FAILING TO PAY HISCOURT FEES. THAT SOUNDS HARSH
BUT THIS GUY TERRORIZED THECOMMUNITY
BY STEALING A CAN OF BEER WORTH LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS.
HEY, IF THIS GUY WANTED TOSTAY OUT OF JAIL HE SHOULD HAVE
STUCK TO PETTY CRIME.
FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREATSTART. IT'S A BABY STEP. BUT
WE'RE MISSING OUT ON ALL KINDS OF OTHER CHARGE-PORTUNITIES.
FOR INSTANCE, WHAT ABOUT WOMEN'SPRISON.
THEY SHOULD INCLUDE AN ENTERTAINMENT FEE BECAUSE
AFTER ALL, THEY'RE WATCHING ALIVE  PRESENTATION OF
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK.
AND DEATH ROW INMATES.
DEATH ROW INMATES ALWAYS REQUESTLAST MEALS BUT WHY SHOULD THEY
BE ALLOWED TO SKIP OUT ON THE CHECK.
AND IF CRIMINALS THINK GETTING TASED STINGS, WAIT UNTIL THEY
GET THE ELECTRICITY BILL.
NOW, SOME MAY SAY THAT JAILING PEOPLE OVER THEIR DEBT MAKES
POVERTY INTO A CRIME. IF THAT'STRUE MAYBE WE SHOULD CUT OUT
THE MIDDLE MAN AND PUT  ALL POORPEOPLE IN JAIL.
OF COURSE, THIS WILL REQUIRE NEWPRISON FACILITIES WHICH WE CAN
BUILD USING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T PAYTHEIR PRISON FEES.
NOT AS WORKERS, AS THE BRICKS.
I SAY WE JUST STACK THEM UP IN ACUBE AND LEAVE AN OPENING TO
CRAM MORE IN AND LOCK UP AND THROW AWAY WHICHEVER PRISONER IS
THE KEY BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO COVER THE RISING COST OF
PRISON BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON NO MATTER HOW MANY POOR PEOPLE
WE THROW IN JAIL IT KEEPS GETTING OVERCROWDED.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
