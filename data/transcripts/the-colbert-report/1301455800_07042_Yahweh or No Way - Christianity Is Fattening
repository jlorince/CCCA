FOLKS, THEY SAY CLEANLINESS IS
NEXT TO GODLINESS, WHICH IS WHY
I BAPTIZED MY CHILDREN IN
PINE-SOL.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS YAWEH OR NO WAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, ONE OF THE BEST-SELLING
POINTS OF CHRISTIANITY IS THAT
JESUS IS TOTALLY CUT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME
CANNOT BE SAID OF HIS FOLLOWERS.
>> A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT YOUNG
ADULTS WHO FREQUENTLY ATTEND
RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES ARE 50%
MORE LIKELY TO BE OBESE BY
MIDDLE AGE THAN THOSE WITH NO
RELIGIOUS INVOLVEMENT.
>> Stephen: EVIDENTLY THE
BIBLE BELT NEEDS AN ELASTIC
WAISTBAND.
(LAUGHTER)
THE STUDY TRACKED CHURCH GOERS
STARTING IN THEIR 20s WHO BY
THE TIME THEY REACHED MIDDLE AGE
WEREN'T JUST FILLED WITH THE
HOLY SPIRIT, THEY WERE DOUBLE
STUFFED.
(LAUGHTER)
SO QUESTION IS, IS GOD
FATTENING?
YAWEH OR NO WAY?
YAWEH.
NOW, SURE, THE BIBLE STARTED AS
A DIET BOOK.
(LAUGHTER)
DON'T EAT THAT APPLE.
NO PORK.
BUT THEN AS MOSES SAID, GOD
REALLY LET HIS PEOPLE GO.
(LAUGHTER)
DAVID'S CUP RUNETH OVER IN PSALM
23 AND SO DID HIS MUFFIN TOP
EVENTUALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND JUST LOOK AT THE LAST
SUPPER, FOLKS.
JESUS IS ASKING HIS DISCIPLES
"ARE YOU GONNA FINISH THAT?"
(LAUGHTER)
SO CLEARLY CHRISTIANITY PACKS
THE POUNDS ON.
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE LOST SO MUCH
WEIGHT RECENTLY WHEN I GAVE UP
CATHOLICISM FOR LENT.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS, FOLKS,
I'VE OFFICIALLY BEEN JEWISH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHICH HAS BEEN GREAT.
(APPLAUSE)
GIVE IT UP FOR THE CHOSEN PEOPLE
(APPLAUSE)
IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL.
I HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH TELLING
SO MANY OFF-COLOR JEWISH JOKES.
(LAUGHTER)
WE ARE A THRIFTY PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT NOW PROBLEM IS TURNS OUT I
LIKE BEING JEWISH.
SO AS A CATHOLIC, I HAVE TO GIVE
THAT UP FOR LENT.
SO I NEED A NEW FAITH.
THIS WEEKEND I TRIED RASTAFARIAN
ISM.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK.
