EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT ISTHE AUTHOR OF "EXCELLENT SHEEP"
ABOUT THE FAILURE OF IVY LEAGUESCHOOLS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ

PLEASE WELCOME WILLIAMDERESIEWICZ!
GOOD TO SEE YOU!
IS IT DR. DERESIEWICZ, DOYOU HAVE A Ph.D.?
>> I DO. YOU CAN CALL ME BILL.
>> Stephen: FINE.
DR. BILL, THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE. YOU'RE A CONTRIBUTING
WRITER TO THE NATION, ACONTRIBUTING EDITOR FOR THE
NEW REPUBLIC AND THE AMERICANSCHOLAR.
YOU TAUGHT AT YALE FOR TENYEARS, AND BEFORE THAT
YOU WERE A GRADUATE INSTRUCTORAT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLEDEXCELLENT SHEEP, THE
MISEDUCATION OF THE AMERICANELITE AND THE WAY TO A
MEANINGFUL LIFE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THAT TITLE IS AS LONG AS THEDOCTORATE, OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)I HOPE THAT TITLE WENT THROUGH
PEER REVIEW.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOUMEAN THE MISEDUCATION OF THE
AMERICAN ELITE?
ARE YOU SAYING LIKE IVY LEAGUESCHOOLS AREN'T WHAT THEY'RE
CRACKED UP FOR?
>> THEY'RE NOT WHAT THEY'RECRACKED UP TO BE.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAININGA WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP CLASS.
>> STEPHEN: BUT YOU'RE AN IVYLEAGUE GUY, RIGHT?
>> I AM.
>> Stephen: WHY DID ONE OF THEIVY LEAUGUE PEOPLE WRITE THE
BOOK SAYING, DON'T GO TO THOSEIVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS!
LET ME PULL UP THAT LADDERBEHIND ME, MUST BE IN YOUR WAY!
ENJOY YOUR STATE SCHOOL, HAVE AGREAT TIME! I HEAR THEY
HAVE FRATS>> IF WE HADN'T WORKED THERE,
YOU WOULD SAY, WHAT DO YOU GUYSKNOW?
WE'VE SEEN WHAT GOES ON IN THESAUSAGE FACTORY, WE'VE SEEN HOW
THE ELITE ARE PRODUCED.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE THEYPRODUCED?
I'M AN ELITE MYSELF.
I WENT TO DARTMOUTH, MY FRIEND.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT DO KIDSHAVE TO DO TO GET THERE.
>> Stephen: MY GRANDFATHER HADTO BUILD A BUILDING.
>> THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKSANYMORE.
>> Stephen: REALLY, YOU CAN'TJUST BUILD A BUILDING?
THEY JUMP THROUGH ONE HOOPTHROUGH ANOTHER TO BECOME
PERFECTIONIST AND CONFORMIST.KIDS ARE TAUGHT TO JUMP
THROUGH THE HOOPS AND NOTTHINK FOR THEMSELVES OR
DIRECT THEIR OWN LIVES OR DECIDEWHAT THEY WANT TO DO AFTER
COLLEGE AND THE COLLEGES DONOTHING TO GET IN THE WAY. SO
WE HAVE KIDS WHO ARE GREAT ATGETTING A'S BUT NOT GREAT AT
FIGURING OUT WHAT'S GOING TOGIVE THEM A SENSE OF MEANING AND
PURPOSE IN THEIR LIFE, MAKE THEMTHE LEADERS THE COLLEGES ARE
SUPPOSEDLY PREPARING TO DO, THELEADERS WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH.
WE'VE SEEN THIS BASICALLYMASSIVE FAILURE IN THE
LEADERSHIP CLASS IN THE LAST 10,15, 20, 30 YEARS, THAT THESE
SCHOOLS ARE CREATING.
>> Stephen: I'M A LEADER.
YOU'RE A LEADER.
WHAT'S THE FAILURE OF THELEADERSHIP?
>> WE ARE EXCEPTIONS, STEPHEN.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Stephen: SO WE'RE OKAY.
WE'RE OKAY.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT BANKS,CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENT,
SCHOOLS, NONPROFITS. THEY'RE NOTDOING THEIR JOBS.
THEY'RE NOT SERVING SOCIETY AS AWHOLE BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF.
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA ABOUTGETTING INTO THE SCHOOLS, HIGH
STATUS, HIGH WEALTH.
WHAT ABOUT SERVING SOCIETY AS AWHOLE.
>> Stephen: HOW SHOULD KIDS --IF IT'S NOT WORKING HARD IN HIGH
SCHOOL AND CONFORMING TO THEEXPECTATIONS OF SOCIETY AND THEN
CRUSHING IT WHEN YOU'RE AT BROWNOR COLUMBIA AND THEN SLIDING
YOURSELF INTO WALL STREET ANDDOING YOUR THING THERE AND
MAKING TONS OF CASH AND GOINGOFF TO, LIKE, YOUR CABIN IN
BELIZE ON THE WEEKEND.
>> AND DO WHAT YOUR PEERS WANTYOU TO DO.
>> Stephen: YOU COMPLAIN A LOTBUT I HEAR NO ANSWERS,
>>  IT'S IN THE BOOK.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT GONNA READYOUR BOOK!
(LAUGHTER)WHAT ARE THE ANSWERS?
WHAT ARE THE ANSWERS, BILL?
>> FORGET ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODYELSE WANTS YOU TO DO, START TO
LISTEN TO YOURSELF, START TOREAD, TO THINK, TAKE TIME OFF,
TAKE TIME AWAY FROM THE SYSTEM,STEP OUTSIDE OF THE BUBBLE,
START TO TUNE IN TO WHAT -->> Stephen: DID YOU DO THAT?
REPEATEDLY.
>> Stephen: WHEN DID YOU DOTHAT?
>> I SPENT FOUR YEARS AFTERCOLLEGE BEFORE I FIGURED OUT
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DOBECAUSE I DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT
THINGS IN COLLEGE, BECAUSE IDIDN'T SHUT OUT ALL THE MESSAGES
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS GIVING ME.
I MAJORED IN THE WRONG THING.
MAYBE I WENT TO THE WRONGCOLLEGE MYSELF.
IN THE END, IT WAS A LONGERPROCESS THAN IT NEEDED TO BE.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS YOURMAJOR?
>> I WAS ACTUALLY ABIOPSYCHOLOGY MAJOR.
>> Stephen: WHATIS BIOPSYCHOLOGY?
DO YOU GET TO WRITE YOURSELFYOUR OWN PRESCRIPTIONS?
>> IT'S WHAT THEY NOW CALLCOGNITIVE SCIENCE. IT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT I COULD DO.
MY DAD WAS A SCIENTIST ANDIMMIGRANT.
HE PUSHED ME IN THAT DIRECTION.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAJOR.
I DID A Ph.D. IN ENGLISHBECAUSE I FIGURED OUT THAT'S
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE MEHAPPY TO FEEL LIKE I WAS
CONTRIBUTING.
>> Stephen: SO IT DOESN'T MATTERWHAT MAKES DAD HAPPY.
HE'S AN IMMIGRANT!
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART!
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART!
I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU,BILLY!
WE DIDN'T COME TO THIS COUNTRYFOR YOU TO SMOKE POT AND PLAY
MADDEN IN YOUR DORM ROOM!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I BROKE HIS HEART, TOO,BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVINGYOUR LIFE AND NOT YOUR PARENTS'
LIVES.
>> Stephen: I CERTAINLY HOPEMY CHILDREN AREN'T WATCHING THIS
RIGHT NOW.
YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY AT ALLTIMES!
