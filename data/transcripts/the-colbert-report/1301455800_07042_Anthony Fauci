>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EXPERT IN
INFECTIOUS DISEASES.
DON'T WORRY, I'M WEARING
PROTECTION.
PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY FAUCI!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, DR. FAUCI, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU
WORK WITH INIF HE CANS DISEASES
ON A DAILY BASIS, CORRECT?
>> CORRECT.
SPHEUP WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE
NEXT BIG HOT NEWS DISEASE?
BECAUSE WE HAD SARS, WE'VE HAD
SWINE FLU, WE'VE HAD BIRD FLU
AND I WANT TO GET MY GRAPHICS
DEPARTMENT WORKING ON THE NEXT
THING THAT'S GOING TO SCARE THE
POOP OUT OF THESE PEOPLE.
TURKEY HERPES?
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?
>> Stephen: THE...
>> THE INTERESTING THING IS WE
DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S ALWAYS THE THREAT OF
EMERGING AND REEMERGING
INFECTIONS AND ONE OF THE ISSUES
WE FACE IS THAT NATURE IS ONE OF
THE WORST TERRORISTS IN THAT
RESPECT.
IT JUST COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, A
LOT OF TIMES JUMPING SPECIES
FROM AN ANIMAL TO A HUMAN.
>> Stephen: I KNOW NATURE IS
DANGEROUS.
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN
POLLUTION.
HIT THEM FIRST.
KILL OR BE KILLED.
OKAY.
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT A SERIOUS
SUBJECT THAT I THOUGHT WAS NO
LONGER THAT SERIOUS OF A
SUBJECT-- AIDS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS DONE.
I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT WE WERE
DONE WITH THAT BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE A BROADWAY
MUSICAL ON RIGHT NOW ABOUT IT.
WE DON'T... YOU DON'T SEE LIKE
THE SPECIALS ON T.V.
IT'S JUST NOT A CAUSE CELEB LIKE
IT ONCE WAS.
WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT IT
IF IT'S STILL A BIG DEAL?
>> PEOPLE GET USED TO IT BEING
AROUND AND GET COMPLACENT ABOUT
IT.
IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
2.6 MILLION PEOPLE EACH YEAR IN
THE WORLD GET INFECTED.
BUT IN THIS COUNTRY 56,000 NEW
INFECTIONS EACH YEAR.
AND IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE
LAST TEN OR 15 YEARS.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE SO MANY
PEOPLE STILL GETTING IT?
BECAUSE WE HAVE ABSTINENCE
EDUCATION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT RARELY WORKS.
THAT RARELY WORKS.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> HUMAN NATURE.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE REASON IS THAT PEOPLE
FEEL... WELL, ONE OF THE
IMPORTANT REASONS IS THAT THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST PRACTICING
RISK BEHAVIOR ARE OFTEN IN A
SITUATION WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO THE KIND OF
EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS...
>> Stephen: WHO'S MOST AT RISK
HERE?
>> WELL, IN THE UNITED STATES
IT'S RALLY SAD THAT 12% OF THE
POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND OF THE
NEW INFECTIONS LAST YEAR, ABOUT
50% OF THEM WERE AMONG AFRICAN
AMERICANS.
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
REASONS, SOCIOECONOMIC AND OTHER
REASONS THAT COME INTO PLAY.
AND IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITY?
N SOMEWHAT CONTRAST TO THE WHITE
COMMUNITY, TO BE GAY IS NOT
GENERALLY AS MUCH ACCEPTED IN
THE COMMUNITY OF BLACK
INDIVIDUALS.
>> Stephen: IT CAN BE TOUGH IN
THE WHITE COMMUNITY, TOO.
>> WELL, IT CAN.
IT CAN BE QUITE ENOUGH THE WHITE
COMMUNITY BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE
STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
>> Stephen: THERE A VACCINE
YET?
>> NOT YET.
THERE'S NOT.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
A VACCINE IS TO BE A RICH WHITE
PERSON.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT HELPS, RIGHT?
IT HELPS LOWER THE CHANCES?
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD
HEALTH CARE, TO SOMEONE WHO'S
GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT THE
RISKS ARE AND TO GET YOU TESTED
TO IDENTIFY IF YOU ARE INFECTED,
TO GET INTO A GOOD TREATMENT
PROGRAM, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.
TO BE WHITE AND RICH IS MUCH
BETTER IN THAT RESPECT FROM THE
HEALTH STAN POINT THAN TO BE IN
A COMMUNITY THAT'S
DISENFRANCHISED.
>> Stephen: LET'S GO OVER THE
BASICS.
I KNOW YOU CAN TRANSMIT AIDS
THROUGH SEX.
WHAT ABOUT KISSING?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: AND CRYING?
>> NO.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: OKAY, THAT'S GOOD
BECAUSE I ALSO DO THOSE DURING
SEX.
(LAUGHTER)
ARE WE STILL TALKING CONDOMS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M NOT A CATHOLIC RIGHT NOW OR
ELSE THAT WOULD OFFEND ME.
(LAUGHTER).
>> WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
NO PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: I'M THINKING OF
ACTUALLY BECOMING A SHAKER.
THAT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY NOT
TO GET AIDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE SEX AT ALL.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEIR CONDOMS
ARE MADE OF WICKER.
(LAUGHTER).
>> THAT WOULD HURT.
THAT WOULD HURT.
>> Stephen: NOW GEORGE W. BUSH
HAD AN ANTI-AIDS INITIATIVE IN
THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
SPECIFICALLY SUBSAHARAN AFRICA.
YOU SPEARHEADED THAT EFFORT FOR
WHICH YOU GOT THE MEDAL OF
FREEDOM FROM THE PRESIDENT.
YOU GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO
PRESIDENT BUSH FOR THAT.
WHY?
>> BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY INITIATED
IT.
WHATEVER YOUR FEELING ABOUT
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH IS, HE
TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO SAY WE
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP
PEOPLE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD,
PARTICULARLY IN SUBSAHARAN
AFRICA.
>> Stephen: IN WAYS THAT
WEREN'T NECESSARILY POPULAR WITH
THE CONSERVATIVE BASE.
>> HE HAD TROUBLE GETTING IT
THROUGH BECAUSE REMEMBER WE HAD
A CONSERVATIVE GROUP AND HE CAME
IN AND SAID NO, WE'RE GOING TO
DO IT.
>> Stephen: WHEN IT COMES TO
FIGHTING AIDS, GEORGE BUSH,
GREAT PRESIDENT OR THE GREATEST
PRESIDENT?
(LAUGHTER).
>> I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO
FIGHTING AIDS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AND INTERNATIONAL HEALTH HE'S
DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB.
>> Stephen: I'LL PUT YOU DOWN
FOR GREATEST.
DR. FAUCI, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
