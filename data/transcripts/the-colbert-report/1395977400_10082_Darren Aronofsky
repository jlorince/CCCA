(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DARREN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
MR. ARONOFSKY, MAESTRO, OKAYLET'S GET ITS BONA FIDES
OUT HERE.
YOU DIRECTED THE WRESTLER,THE FOUNTAIN, REQEIUM FOR A
DREAM.
YOUR LAST MOVIE, BLACK SWANWON THE NATALIE PORTMAN
AWARD FOR OSCARING.
CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW YOUR NEWMOVIE IS NOAH STARRING
RUSSELL CROWE, RELEASEDTOMORROW.
WHY DID YOU DO A BIBLICALMOVIE?
DID YOU GET A MESSAGE FROMGOD OR-- OR SOMEONE MORE
POWERFUL LIKE PARAMOUNTPICTURES?
WHY DO A BIBLE MOVIE.
>> IT WAS MY 7th GRADEENGLISH TEACHER, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> I HAD A MAGICAL TEACHER.
>> Stephen: MAGICAL,LIKE-- LIKE WITH WINGS AND A
WAND.
>> NO, SHE JUST WAS VERYINSPIRATIONAL, WEARING ALL
PINK, PINK EYE SHADOW, DROVEA PINK MUSTANG, AND SHE SAID
ONE DAY TAKE OUT A PAPER ANDPEN AND WRITE A POEM AND I
ENDED WRITING SOMETHING ONNOAH, A POEM AND ENDED UP
WINNING A CONTEST AND ITSENT ME DOWN THE PATH OF
BEING A CREATIVE STORYTELLER.
>> Stephen: HOW IS THE STORYOF NOAH ABOUT PEACE, BECAUSE
IT IS-- I MEAN YOU'RE KNOWNFOR DOING SOME DARK TALES.
BUT ALL OF MANKIND IS KILLEDEXCEPT ONE FAMILY.
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: AND IT'S ALITTLE DARK.
HOW IS THAT A STORY OFPEACE.
GOD KICKING ASS AND TAKINGNAMES IN THIS MOVIE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I'M SURPRISED YOU NO HE THATBECAUSE MOST PEOPLE TURN IT
INTO THIS NURSERY STORY,WITH THE LONG WHITE BEARD,
THE ROBE AND THE SANDALS.
>> Stephen: OLD TESTAMENTGOD HAS SOME ANGER ISSUES.
>> VERY SERIOUS.
>> Stephen: HE IS A JEALOUSGOD.
>> VERY, VERY ANGRY.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES HE KILLNEFERN THIS ONE, IS IT
STILL WATER.
>> YEAH, WE DIDN'T CHANGETHAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THEMESSAGE OF THE STORY FOR
YOU?
BECAUSE IT GETS TURNED INTOTHIS, YOU KNOW-- GOD TOLD
NOAH TO BUILD HIM AN ARKYARKY.
>> I DON'T KNOW THE SONG.
I HEARD SOMEONE ELSE TALKABOUT BUT I DON'T KNOW IT
SAYS, YOU KNOW, IN GENESIS 6IT SAYS THAT HE WAS GRIEVED
TO HIS HEART, GOD.
AND TO ME THAT WAS LIKE WOW,STHAT IS A POWERFUL TO WANT
TO DESTROY CREATION BECAUSEIS THE FOURTH STORY IN THE
BIBLE, YOU KNOW, CREATION,ORIGINAL SIN, THE FIRST
MURDER CANE KILLS ABLE ANDTHEN JUMPS FORWARD TEN
GENERATIONS AND YOU ARE ATNOAH AND SUDDENLY HE WANTS
TO DESTROY ALL OF CREATION.
TO US THAT WAS A BIGEMOTIONAL DECISION, YOU KNOW
IF SUDDENLY YOU WANT TODESTROY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING THAT YOU CREATED, ANDSO WE TRIED TO DRAMATIZE
THAT, WE TRIED TOBRING THAT TO LIFE THROUGH
RUSSELL CROWE'S CHARACTER.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU CHANGEDSOME STUFF THOUGH.
>> NOT ALL.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TAKENSOME LIBERTIES.
>> WHAT IS LIBERTY, WHENYOU CAST RUSSELL CROWE IT'S
A LIBERTY, YOU KNOW.
THE SPIRIT OF THE STORY ISTOLD AND EVERYONE BELIEVES
IN GOD IN THE FILM.
BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S NOT JUSTA BIBLICAL STORY IT SAY
MYTHICAL STORY AND BECOMESSO MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN
YOU ACCEPT IT AS MYTH.
LIKE YOU TAKE THE STORY OF ICARUS, YOU DON'T ASK IF
THE FEATHERS AND WAX HADTHAT-- EVERYONE KNOWS THE
STORY OF HUBRIS, YOU FLY TOOHIGH AND YOU GET BURNT BUT
IF YOU START TO GET INTOWHAT IS REAL, ALL OF THE SILLY
CONVERSATIONS WHETHER IT ISHISTORICAL OR NOT.
>> Stephen: LIKE EVERY WORDOF THE BIBLE-- EVERY WORD OF
THE BIBE IS ABSOLUTELYTRUE AND HAPPENED.
>> NO, BUT YOU WILL GETNONBELIEVERS SAYING HOW DID
ALL THE ANIMALS GET ON THEBOAT.
>> Stephen: GOD SENT THEM.
>> BUT HOW DID THEY ALL FIT.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE MATHWHERE THEY TRY TO FIT
EVERYTHING ON IT.
>> Stephen: WE KNOW HOW ITHAPPENED.
LET'S SHOW THE PEOPLE HOW ITHAPPENED.
>> OKAY, HERE WE GO.
>> IT BEGINS.
>> IT BEGINS.
>> Stephen: LOOKS LIKETHEY'RE GOING TO FIT TO ME.
NOW I SAW A LOT OF ANIMALS.
I SAW A LOT OF MAMMALS ANDBIRDS, WERE THERE SNAKES.
>> YES, YES, EVERYTHING ISINCLUDED.
THAT'S A REALLY FUNNY SCENE.
>> Stephen: AT ANY POINT INTHE MOVIE DOES NOAH SAY I'M
TIRED OF THESE [BLEEP]SNAKES ON MY MOTHER [BLEEP]
ARK.
>> YOU CAN CURSE.
>> YOU KNOW, THAT WAS-- WETHOUGHT ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
BEING A LITTLE BIT INSPIREDBY THAT MOVIE BUT DECIDED TO
TURN AGAINST THE COMEDY ANDLOOK AT THE DRAMA.
>> Stephen: WHY ONLY MAKEONE MOVIE, THOUGH.
IT'S FOUR CHAPTERS IN THEBIBLE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT TURN ITINTO THREE MOVIES LIKE THE
HOBBIT.
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHERE THE FIRSTONE GOD SAYS BUILD AN ARK.
THE SECOND ONE IS ARKBUILDING AND THE THIRD ONE
IS THE STORM.
>> WE COULD HAVE KEPT GOINGFOR A LONG TIME, I KNOW.
>> Stephen: WHO PLAYS GOD.
>> GOD, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'TWANT TO PERSONIFY HIM AND
MORGAN FREEMAN AND JAMESEARL JONES WERE SORT OF BUSY
AND GEORGE BURNS IS DEADSO-- YOU KNOW, WE DECIDED.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A VOICEOR ANYTHING.
>> NO, NO, WE DECIDED TOCAPTURE THE MAJESTY OF THE
CREATOR THROUGH IMAGE ANDSOUND AND MUSIC BECAUSE WE
THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MUCHBETTER.
THERE IS ACTUALLY, THERE WASA BIG DEBATE BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE SAYING WHY DOESN'T GODSPEAK IN THE FILM AND
ACTUALLY A HEBREW WORD IS THEWORD SAY WHICH REFERS MORE
TO DREAM THAN IT DOESACTUALLY TO SPOKEN WORD.
AND IT IS A MORE SPECIFICWORD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
USED THAN THE SPOKEN WORD SOWE WERE INSPIRED BY THAT TO
ACTUALLY MAKE IT SOMETHINGVISUAL AND INSPIRING.
>> Stephen: IN THE MOVIE DOYOU DEAL WITH LIKE THE FISH
AND THE WHALES.
>> THERE IS A QUICK SHOT OFIT BUT RAN OUT OF MONEY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> AND ALL THE DOLPHINS WEREBUSY, YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD HAVEBEEN GREAT.
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.
>> Stephen: IS THEREANY-- IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKEDABOUT IT BESIDES THERE IS A
LOT OF ACTION, BECAUSE IT ISA VENGEFUL GOD, A LOT OF
THINGS HAPPEN, SAMPSON,DELILA , IS THERE ANY SPICY
STUFF BECAUSE THERE IS SPICYSTUFF NOTICE OLD TESTAMENT,
ONAN, IS THERE ANY -->> IT IS EMMA WATSON AND
JENNIFER CONNOLLY SHOWINGUP.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
>> Stephen: ANY BLACK SWANSITUATION GOING ON.
>> YOU KNOW THAT SCENE I'MTALKING ABOUT.
I KNOW WHY YOU MADE $300MILLION, MY FRIEND.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: LET'S PUT ASSES IN THE SEATS-- DID THAT HAPPEN?
>> IT WAS INTERESTINGBECAUSE RUSSELL WAS A VERY,
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY WANTEDTO HAVE AN EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION WITH HIS WIFE ANDI WAS SORT OF LIKE WHOA, BUT
IT WAS NICE TO SEE THEPATRIARCH KISSING AND SORT
OF TENDER AND IT WASBEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T THINK
IT WILL FLOAT YOUR BOAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT MYARK?
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: DARRENARONOFSKY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
DARREN ARONOFSKY, THE MOVIEIS NOAH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
