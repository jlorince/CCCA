YOU'RE ALMOST... YOU'RE ALMOST
TOO KIND.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, ALL ACROSS THIS GREAT
NATION OF OURS, THE BIG NEWS
CONTINUES TO BE MY UPCOMING
MARCH TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
KEEPFEARALIVE.COM.
GO AND SIGN UP.
IF ENOUGH OF YOU SHOW UP TO MY
RALLY, WE WON'T JUST BE ABLE TO
KEEP FEAR ALIVE, WE MAY BE ABLE
TO BRING SOME FEARS BACK FROM
THE DEAD.
MOTHER, DID YOU KNOW THEY NEVER
CAPPED THAT WELL THAT BABY
JESSICA FELL DOWN?
LOCK YOUR DOORS!
BUT THERE IS ONE FEAR, FOLKS, I
MUST LAY TO REST RIGHT NOW.
THE GNAWING FEAR THAT YOU MISSED
MY RALLY, WHICH YOU MIGHT THINK
I HELD YESTERDAY IN PORTLAND,
MAINE, IF YOU SAW.
THIS.
JIM.
>> REPEAL "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL" OR GO HOME.
GO HOME.
GO HOME.
GO HOME.
>> Stephen: NEW DON'T PANIC.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT WASN'T ME.
FIRST OFF, I HAVEN'T WORN MY
HAIR LIKE THAT SINCE I WORKED AT
"THE DAILY SHOW."
NO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO.
THAT IS LADY GAGA.
WEARING MY SIGNATURE OUTFIT OF
SUIT, TIE AND GLASSES, AND, OF
COURSE, IT BEING LADY GAGA, SHE
HAD TO MAKE IT SLUTTY WITH A
SINGLE WINDSOR.
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS, FOLKS, YOU
HAVEN'T MISSED YOUR CHANCE TO
DEFEAT JON STEWART'S CALL FOR
SANITY AND TO HELP ME KEEP FEAR
ALIVE.
THE IS CLEARLY WORKING BECAUSE
SOME OTHERWISE STABLE PEOPLE ARE
ALREADY TERRIFIED OF SINISTER
PLOTS.
>> JON STEWART HAS SHOWN HIS
COLORS ALONG WITH STEPHEN
COLBERT, AND THEY ARE GOING TO
ACTIVATE THE YOUTH TO TRY TO GET
THEM TO VOTE.
THEN JON STEWART AND STEPHEN
COLBERT WILL GO AND ACTIVATE THE
YOUTH.
>> Stephen: WHO TOLD HIM ABOUT
THE YOUTH ACTIVATION?
NOW, LOOK, LOOK, FOLKS, FOLKS,
SINCE HE SPILLED THE BEANS, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT JON'S PLANNING,
BUT I'M DEFINITELY ACTIVATING
THE YOUTH.
I'VE BEEN BRAINWASHING THEM FOR
FIVE YEARS, AND COME 30 OCTOBER,
THEY WILL DO MY BIDDING.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NOT TO VOTE.
THAT WOULD BE TOO OBVIOUS.
FOR THE RECORD, I WANT THEM TO
BE AFRAID TO VOTE, WHICH REMINDS
ME, YOUNG PEOPLE, PULLING THAT
LEVER COULD GIVE YOU HAS HAND
CANCER.
[LAUGHTER]
SO WHAT'S MY REAL PURPOSE, YOU
ASK.
OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT IN DUE TIME.
THE REAL QUESTION, GLENN, IS
WHAT IS THE PRECONDITIONED
ACTIVATION CODE?
IS IT "THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS"?
OR PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING
COMPLETELY ARBITRARY.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, PIRATE
SQUIRREL?
[SCREECHING]
QUIET, MY LOVELY.
OR THEY COULD BE ACTIVATED BY A
COMPLETELY INNOCUOUS PHRASE THAT
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO TODAY'S
YOUTH, LIKE "420."
WHEN THEY HEAR, THAT I'M SURE
THEY'LL SPRING INTO ACTION WITH
ENERGY AND FOCUS.
AND MY CONTINUED EFFORT TO KEEP
FEAR ALIVE, YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY
POOR PEOPLE AND THEIR NUMBERS
ARE GROWING EVERY DAY.
JIM?
>> GOVERNMENT FIGURES OUT TODAY
SHOW THE NATION'S POVERTY RATE
JUMPED TO 14.3% LAST YEAR, MORE
THAN 43.5 MILLION AMERICANS WERE
IN NEED.
THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN
HALF A CENTURY OF RECORD
KEEPING.
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S THE
HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE THE
GOVERNMENT STARTED KEEPING TRACK
IN 1959.
PRIOR TO THAT, OF COURSE, THERE
WERE NO POOR PEOPLE.
AND ACCORDING TO VOTER ROLLS, IN
MANY STATES, NO BLACK PEOPLE.
NATION, THESE STATISTICS ARE
AWFUL FOR THE OBVIOUS REASON.
THEY THREATEN THE BUSH TAX CUT
FOR THE WEALTHY.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS BLEEDING
HEART BRITISH BABE ON FOX
BUSINESS GOING AFTER MY CASH.
>> IF THE GOP HAVE THEIR WAY AND
KEPT THOSE TAX CUTS, APPARENTLY
IT WILL ADD $4 TRILLION TO THE
DEFICIT OVER NEXT FOUR YEARS.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO PASS THE
STIMULUS, THEN I'M AFRAID... THE
LOWER MIDDLE CLASS WILL GET IT,
NOT THE RICH WHO ARE DOING VERY
WELL.
>> WE'VE NEVER MADE THE POOR
RICH TAXING THE RICH, YOU
REALIZE THAT?
>>
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, NEAL.
IF RICH PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TAX,
WHY WOULD THE POOR EVEN WANT TO
BECOME RICH?
[LAUGHTER]
I KNOW I'D RATHER LIVE IN A
SHANTY MADE OF MY OWN CHILDREN'S
TEARS THAN HAVE TO PAY 15% ON A
REALIZED CAPITAL GAIN OF $8
MILLION.
REPUBLICAN SENATE MINORITY
LEADER AND HUMAN JOWL HYBRID
MITCH McCONNELL KNOWS WHO THE
TRULY NEEDY ARE, THOSE MAKING
OVER $200,000 A YEAR, CALLING
THEM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
HIT HARDEST BY THIS RECESSION.
IT'S TRUE, THE RICH HAVE REALLY
SUFFERED.
IN FACT, I KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOW SUMMER HOMELESS.
[LAUGHTER]
SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT DELIVERY SERVICE THEIR NEXT
MEAL IS COMING FROM.
BESIDES, GIVING MONEY TO RICH
PEOPLE DRIVES THE ECONOMY.
WHAT DO POOR PEOPLE DO WITH
THEIR MONEY?
THEY BLOW IT FIRST HEATING BILL
THAT COMES ALONG.
IT'S ALWAYS ME, ME, ME, HOW AM I
GOING TO FEED MY FAMILY, HOW AM
I GOING TO PLAY MY RENT, SOMEONE
ALERT MY NEXT OF KIN.
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME, FOLKS, THIS
POVERTY REPORT IS MUCH ADIEU
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING.
HERE TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A
MONSTER ABOUT SAYING THAT IS THE
MANAGING DIRECTOR OF SAVE THE
CHILDREN'S U.S. PROGRAM.
PLEASE WELCOME MARK SHRIVER.
MARK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MARK, THESE NUMBERS, ALMOST 44
MILLION PEOPLE LIVING BELOW THE
POVERTY LINE.
ONE IN SEVEN PEOPLE.
WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S A BUMMER, OKAY.
OKAY.
I DOESN'T HELP.
WE WILL HAVE THE POOR ALWAYS.
>> IT'S A NATIONAL DISGRACE.
IT'S REALLY AN AMAZING FIGURE
WHEN YOU HAVE 43 MILLION PEOPLE
MANY POVERTY IN THIS COUNTRY.
IT'S THE BIGGEST NUMBER EVER.
REALLY THE MOST DISTURBING FACT
IS KIDS ARE FEELING THE BRUNT OF
THE ECONOMY WORSE THAN ADULTS.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU'RE PLAYING
THE STARVING CHIDE CARD, AND I
DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR.
MAYBE IF THE KIDS HAD JOBS, THEY
WOULDN'T BE SO POOR.
ISN'T CHILD LABOR LAWS KEEPING
US FROM BEING PROSPEROUS AGAIN?
GET THOSE GUYS BACK IN THE
FACTORIES.
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> BUT THE REAL ANSWER IS WHEN
ROW HAVE ONE IN FIVE KIDS
LIVERING IN POVERTY, YOU WANT TO
TAKE THOSE DOLLARS IN THE
ECONOMY AND INVEST THEM IN EARLY
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.
>> THE BEST THESE NUMBERS EVER
WERE, RIGHT NOW IT'S 1 IN SEVEN,
THE BEST THESE NUMBERS EVER GOT
FOR AMERICA WAS ONE IN MINE BACK
IN 1973.
ISN'T THIS JUST A ROUNDING
ERROR, THE ONE IN SEVEN?
DO WE REALLY... IS IT AN
ALARMING STATISTIC OR JUST AN
ONGOING SAD STATISTIC?
>> IT'S THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN
THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES.
WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR OBVIOUSLY
OVER 200 YEARS, AND MOST PEOPLE
IN POVERTY EVER.
WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING
ABOUT IS NOT THESE ALARMING
STATISTICS BUT REALLY THE NEED
TO INVEST IN THESE KIDS TO HELP
THEM LEFT THEMSELVES OUT OF
POVERTY.
IT'S A COMBINATION.
>> THE GOVERNEMNT CAN'T DO
ANYTHING.
WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO
ANYTHING.
THE GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF IT.
HOUSES OF WORSHIP.
I LIKE THAT.
>> FAMILIES NEED TO GET
INVOLVED.
HOUSES OF WORSHIP NEED TO GET
INVOLVED.
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT MADE A
COMMITMENT IN THE '60s, THE
BEST NUMBERS WERE IN THE 70s.
THAT'S A RESULT OF THE KENNEDY
AND JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION.
WE HAD PUBLIC WILL.
>> Stephen: WE'VE HAD A WAR ON
POVERTY SINCE THE 1960s.
WE'VE HAD A WAR ON DRUGS.
WE'RE GIVING UP ON THE WAR ON
DRUGS.
WE'RE GOING TO LEGALIZE
MARIJUANA BECAUSE WE COULDN'T
WIN IT.
IS IT TIME TO LEGALIZE POVERTY?
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
CLEARLY I THINK IF YOU TALK TO
FOLKS, WHEN YOU HAVE 43 MILLION
PEOPLE IN POVERTY...
>> Stephen: YOU THROW AROUND
THIS NUMBER, 43 MILLION PEOPLE
IN POVERTY, ONE IN SEVEN
AMERICAN, BUT WE'RE STILL THE
RICHEST COUNTRY ON EARTH,
CORRECT?
>> WE ARE THE RICHEST COUNTRY ON
EARTH.
>> Stephen: SO ON AVERAGE
EVERYTHING IS HO U.K.Y DORIE.
GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME GET TO HOLD
ON THE THAT MONEY FOR THE POOR
PEOPLE.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: TO KEEP IT CLEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK CLEARLY WHAT WE WANT
TO DO IS... AND WHEN AMERICA HAS
BEEN AT ITS GREATEST IS WHEN WE
USE IMAGINATION.
YOU'RE DOING A BIG RALLY IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
>> Stephen: I AM.
ARE YOU GOING TO BE THERE IF I
INVITE YOU?
>> IF YOU INVITE ME.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NOT INVITED
YOU YET.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT AMERICA'S
HISTORY, WE'VE DONE GREAT THINGS
WHEN WE USE OUR IMAGINATION AND
WHEN WE MOBILIZE RESOURCES.
LOOK AT DEFEATING THE GERMANS,
MAKING INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE FOR THE NAZIS?
>> NO, I'M NOT.
LOOK AT PUTTING MAN ON THE MOON.
THE COUNTRY HAS RALLIED AROUND
THE CAUSE.
IF WE MOBILIZE AS A COUNTRY, WE
CAN HELP KIDS OUT OF POVERTY.
>> Stephen: DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S DISGRACEFUL WHEN YOU HAVE
ONE IN FIVE KIDS -- I THINK IT'S
FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IF WE DON'T
HELP THE POOR, THEY WILL RISE UP
AGAINST US.
RIGHT?
THAT'S HOW REVOLUTIONS START.
THAT'S A COMPELLING REASON.
>> IT IS.
>> Stephen: BEING FRIGHTENED
OF THE POOR I THINK IS A
COMPELLING REASON TO HELP THEM.
THAT'S HOW I THINK FEAR CAN HELP
OUR NATION.
WILL YOU HELP ME IN SAYING IF WE
DON'T HELP THE POOR, THEY WILL
RISE UP AGAINST US?
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN INVITED TO THE
RALLY YET, SO I DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: IF YOU SAY, "HELP
THE POOR OR THEY WILL RISE UP
AGAINST US," I WILL INVITE YOU.
>> RIGHT NOW?
>> Stephen: YES.
>> I CAN'T SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: NO INVITATION FOR
YOU, MY FRIEND.
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL COME AROUND.
MARK
