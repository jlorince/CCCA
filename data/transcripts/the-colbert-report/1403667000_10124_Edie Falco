LONG TIME.
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW YOUWERE THE ONLY ACTRESS TO WIN AN
ENEMY IN BOTH THE DRAMATIC ANDCOMEDY CATEGORIES.

FOR THAT?
>> I TAKE MY WORK VERYSERIOUSLY, SO I'M, AS WE SPEAK,
DOING RESEARCH.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, GOOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AFTER SIX YEARS OF PLAYING ANURSE, DO YOU EVER SAY TO
YOURSELF, "I COULD FAKE MY WAYTHROUGH A SHIFT?"
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GO INTO AHOSPITAL AND KIND OF ( BLEEP )
FOR THE FIRST SIX HOURS.
>> NOT A CHANCE.
>> Stephen:  JUST YELL THEWORD "STAT" A LOT.
>> NO, I GET MORE NERVOUS NOWTHAN I EVER DID AROUND SICKNESS
BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK I CAN DOSOMETHING.
I RUN IN THE OTHER AS QUICKLY ASPOSSIBLE.
>> Stephen:  DO NURSES EVERCOME UP TO YOU AND SAY, "YEAH,
THAT FEELS RIGHT TO ME.
YOU GET IT RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE."
>> THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO TALKTO ME. THE ONES WHO DON'T
TALK TO ME DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.APPARENTLY THERE ARE NURSES
WHO FEEL OTHER THAN THAT, BUTTHEY'RE NOT COMING UP TO ME AND
FOR THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL.
>> Stephen:  IN SEASON 1, THESHOW WAS PROTESTED BY THE NEW
YORK STATE NURSE'S ASSOCIATIONBECAUSE YOUR CHARACTER "HAD NO
QUALMS ABOUT REPEATEDLYVIOLATING THE NURSING CODE OF
ETHICS."
DO THEY NOT KNOW HOW ACTINGWORKS?
>> I STAY SO FAR OUT OF THATSTUFF, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
I ONLY HEAR ABOUT IT WHENSOMEBODY TELLS ME ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT I WANT TOGET INTO.
IT'S A STORY ABOUT A PRETENDLADY.
>> Stephen:  IT IS A PRETENDLADY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> A VERY NICE LADY.
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
>> TROUBLED.
WHY DO YOU-- SOME WOULD SAYPRETEND. I LIKE TO
THINK OF ACTORS AS LIARS. WHY DOYOU LIE FOR A LIVING?
WHY ARE YOU AN ACTRESS?
>> WELL, I SPENT MANY YEARSPRACTICING THAT PARTICULAR SKILL
AS WELL, AS I AM RIGHT NOW.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  NO, NO, I LIKE,THAT I LIKE THAT.
SO YOU'RE A LIAR.
>> A LITTLE BIT.
>> Stephen:  AREN'T WE ALL,THOUGH?
>> KIND OF, RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  IT'S LOVELY TOHAVE YOU HERE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEENA LIE.
>> Stephen:  NO, NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN YOUHAVE-- YOU HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN
ABOUT YOUR OWN SOBRIETY ANDYOUR OWN RECOVERY.
IS PLAYING NURSE JACKIE, IS ITTEMPTING TO ABUSE AGAIN WHEN
YOU'RE PLAYING SOMEBODY WHO ISABUSING OR IS IT JUST A REMINDER
TO NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN.
>> I'M LUCKY IN THAT IT'S THESECOND OF THOSE TWO THINGS.
IT MAKES ME SO GLAD THAT I'M NOTDOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT
ANYMORE.
YOU GET TO REMEMBER WHAT IT FELTLIKE TO BE ALL MIXED UP IN THAT
CHAOS AND THAT KIND OF POLLUTEDHEAD AND CONFUSED STATE ALL THE
TIME, WHERE IT'S SORT OF A WAYOF LIFE.
>> Stephen:  SO IT ACTUALLYHELPS?
>> IT TOTALLY HELPS.
ABSOLUTELY.
I DON'T KNOW I COULD SAY IT'STHAT WAY FOR EVERYBODY, BUT IT
IS THAT WAY FOR ME.
>> Stephen:  WHEN I'M DIETING,I LIKE TO BAKE FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
>> IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT.
I KNOW A LOT OF SOBERBARTENDERS.
>> Stephen:  REALLY.
>> I TOTALLY GET IT.
"DRINK THIS ONE.
DRINK THIS ONE.
IT'S REALLY GOOD."
>> Stephen:  I LIKE TOSAY "WAS IT CRUNCHY?"
WHEN YOU PLAYED CARMELLA WHY DOYOU THINK SO MANY PEOPLE-- NURSE
JACKIE DOES NOT MAKE ADDICTIONLOOK GOOD.
SHE'S NOT LIKE KEITH RICHARDS.
SHE DOES NOT MAKE IT LOOK GOOD.
BUT CARMELA IS A BELOVEDMATRIARCH, ONE OF THE MOST
BELOVED OF ANY MATRIARCH IN A TVSHOW.
WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE LOVEDHER SO MUCH WHEN SHE KNEW HER
HUSBAND WAS KILLING PEOPLE ANDDUMPING THEM IN THE RIVER AND
SHE DID NOTHING TO STOP TO THEM?
>> VERY COMPLICATED THAT.
I'M NOT THE WRITER, SO I DON'TREALLY KNOW.
SHE WAS DEVOTED TO THE THINGS AMOTHER SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO--
HER CHILDREN, HER HUSBAND, HERFAMILY-- AND WAS LIVING IN THIS
GIANT DENIAL HEAD ABOUT WHATWAS ACTUALLY GOING ON.
THAT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN EXPLAINIT FROM SORT OF AN
INTELLECTUAL BRAIN.
THE WHOLE THING MADE SENSE TO MEWHEN I WAS DOING IT.
I JUST THOUGHT SHE LOVED HERHUSBAND AND HER KIDS, THINKING
HE WORKS HARD, I DON'T KNOW HOW,BUT--
>> Stephen:  HERE'S SOMETHINGTHAT MADE A LITTLE LESS SENSE,
THE ENDING OF THE SOPRANOS.
I HAVE A GUESS THAT NURSE JACKIEIS CARMELA IN THE WITNESS
PROTECTION PROGRAM.
AND SHE TAKES THE DRUG TOFORGET.
YOU CAN HAVE THAT ONE FOR FREE.
YOU TELL THE WRITERS.
>> GRATEFUL ISN'T A BIG ENOUGHWORD.
>> YOU WORK WITH PETA ALSO.
YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN.
>> I AM.
>> YOU WORK WITH PETA.
SPECIFICALLY, YOU URGED PARENTSTO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AWAY FROM
THE CIRCUS BECAUSE OF THE USE OFANIMALS FOR THE CIRCUS.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  HOW DO YOU FEELABOUT GUYS TAKING SELFIES WITH
TIGERS?
>> THAT'S A ROUGH ONE, YOU KNOW.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW INTO IT THETIGERS WERE.
>> Stephen:  EDIE, THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  EDIE FALCO, NURSEJACKIE ON SHOWTIME,
THIS SUNDAY AT 9. WE'LL BERIGHT BACK.
