>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, TONIGHT IS THE SIX-YEAR
ANNIVERSARY OF "THE COLBERT
REPORT."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I KNOW IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE
BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY LAST
NIGHT.
AND AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S
ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, THE
CHELSEA MARKET AT 9th AVENUE AND
15th STREET HERE IN NEW YORK IS
STAGING AN ART EXHIBITION OF
BEHIND-THE-SCENES PHOTOGRAPHY
FROM THE FIRST SIX YEARS OF "THE
COLBERT REPORT."
BUT DON'T WORRY, ALL THE NUDES
ARE TASTEFUL.
(LAUGHTER)
AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES TO DORIS
KEARNS GOODWIN.
ALL OF THESE RARE PHOTOGRAPHS
ARE FOR SALE WITH PROCEEDS GOING
TO BENEFIT DONORS CHOOSE WHICH
SUPPORTS PROJECTS IN PUBLIC
SCHOOLS ACROSS AMERICA.
OF COURSE THERE'S ONLY ONE
GALLERY I ATTEND BECAUSE EVERY
YEAR IT'S GOT MY NEWPORT RATE.
AND BECAUSE IT SERVES FREE WINE.
SO...
(APPLAUSE)
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, MY PORTRAIT FOR YEAR
SEVEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AREN'T I
BEAUTIFUL?
THIS YEAR I'M PORTRAYED HOLDING
THE S.E.C. RULING THAT ALLOWED
ME TO FORM COLBERT SUPERPAC AND
BECOME A WASHINGTON POWER
PLAYER.
HOW BIG A PLAYER?
LET'S JUST SAY I'M NOT LEGALLY
REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THAT
INFORMATION.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL THANKS TO THE SUPREME
COURT'S RULING THAT MONEY EQUALS
FREE SPEECH AND AS YOU CAN SEE
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO MUCH
FREEDOM IT IS SPILLING OUT OF MY
SLEEVES.
THANKS FOR SIX GREAT YEARS,
EVERYBODY.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY ON THE
CREW, ALL MY WRITERS, NERVE
PRODUCTION, EVERYBODY AT THE
NETWORK, BUT ESPECIALLY YOU THE
AUDIENCE.
YOUR LOYALTY AND YOUR SUPPORT
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME BUT NOT
AS MUCH AS YOUR MONEY DOES.
(LAUGHTER)
SO HERE'S TO SIX MORE.
GOOD NIGHT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
