>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT ARE BOTH COMBAT
VETERANS OF THE IRAQ WAR.
BIG DEAL.
LAST YEAR I SERVED SEVEN TOURS
AND EACH LASTED ONE DAY.
PLEASE WELCOME LIEUTENANT
COLONEL BRENT CUMMINGS AND
CORPORAL JOSH BLEILL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, BOTH OF YOU, THANK
YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR
COUNTRY.
YOU PROTECTED AMERICA'S ASSES
AND IF YOU'VE SEEN AMERICA'S
ASSES LATELY, THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN PRETTY HEAVY LIFTING.
TELL ME ABOUT YOU.
LET'S START WITH YOU.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL CUMMINGS,
WHEN DID YOU FIRST START
FIGHTING IN IRAQ, AND WHAT WAS
YOUR TOUR LIKE?
>> I WENT TO IRAQ IN 2007
THROUGH 2008.
I WAS SERVING WITH 216 INFANTRY
IN EAST BAGHDAD.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG WERE YOU
THERE?
>> ALMOST 15 MONTHS.
>> Stephen: ALMOST 15 MONTHS.
NOW, CORPORAL, HOW LONG WERE YOU
IN IRAQ?
>> ABOUT TWO WEEKS.
>> Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
>> I WAS OVER IN FALLUJAH WITH
124 FOURTH MARINE DIVISION, AND
I WAS STRUCK BY AN I.E.D. AND
LOST BOTH LEGS, BROKE MY NOSE
AND JAW.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU
REMEMBER ABOUT IT?
>> I WAS BLACKED OUT FOR TWO
DAYS.
I LOST OUT TWO FRIENDS.
I WOKE UP IN GERMANY.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE IN
BAGHDAD AND YOU WOKE UP IN
GERMANY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I PASSED OUT IN
GERMANY FIVE DAYS ONCE, BUT THAT
WAS OKTOBERFEST.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS BAD.
HOW LONG WAS YOUR RECOVERY?
>> I WAS IN WALTER REED AND A
COUPLE OTHER HOSPITALS FOR 22
MONTHS TOTAL.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE
PROSTHETIC LEGS?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU RUNNING
YET?
TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR
REHABILITATION?
>> I'M FULLY REHABILITATED.
I JUST STARTED RUNNING AGAIN.
I HAVE RUNNING LEGS.
I HAVE WATER-SKIED AND GOTTEN
BACK INTO LIFE, THE SWING OF
THINGS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU, LET'S TALK
ABOUT BEING VETERANS FOR A
MOMENT.
YOU BOTH SERVED YOUR COUNTRY,
BUT BEING A VET IS FOREVER,
RIGHT?
LIKE ONCE YOU'RE A VET YOU'RE
ALWAYS A VET.
IT'S LIKE A HEROIC FORM OF
HERPES.
YOU NEVER GET RID OF IT.
I MEAN THAT IN THE NICEST
POSSIBLE WAY.
IT JUST KEEPS GIVING.
AS VETERAN, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE THANKED?
>> I JUST WANT TO SEE... WE ARE
THANKED.
I FEEL IT WHEN I WALK AMONGST
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND WE LIVE
IN THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE
WORLD, STEPHEN.
>> I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU ON THAT
ONE.
WAY AHEAD OF YOU ON THAT ONE.
>> WE JUST WANT TO CONTINUE
BECAUSE THESE VETERAN, WE NEED
SUPPORT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH...
>> Stephen: ARE YOU AFRAID
PEOPLE WILL THANK YOU NOW AND
FORGET YOU LATER?
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FORGET
US, BUT THEY WON'T REALIZE THE
SACRIFICES MAYBE AND THE
CONTINUED.
JOSH HAD PHYSICAL INJURIES YOU
CAN SEE.
MANY VETERANS HAVE OTHER
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERS,
BRAIN INJURIES THAT NEED CARE
THAT YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY SEE.
AND SOMETIMES, AND I'M GLAD THAT
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS AWARE OF,
THAT BUT I DON'T WANT THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC TO BE AFRAID OF
THOSE VETERANS.
>> THERE'S NO REASON TO BE
AFRAID OF VETS.
WE APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT WE
GET DAILY.
BUT WE'VE OVERCOME A LOT OF
THINGS, AND THESE OBSTACLE,
WHETHER THEY'RE PHYSICAL OR
MENTAL LIKE THE LIEUTENANT
COLONEL SAID, WE HAVE THE
ABILITY TO OVERCOME AND GET BACK
INTO DAILY LIFE AND COME BACK
INTO SOCIETY, AND WE WANT TO BE
PART OF IT AGAIN.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S YOUR JOB NOW?
>> I'M THE COMMUNITY SPOKESMAN
FOR THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS.
>> AWESOME.
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD JOB.
WHAT DO YOU DO, SIR?
>> I'M A COMMANDER AT THE
AIRBORNE SCHOOL IN FORT BENNING,
GEORGIA.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU TEACH ME
TO JUMP OUT OF PLANE?
>> COME ON DOWN.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
I JUST HAVE TO GROW A BIGGER
PAIR OF BALLS AND I'LL BE RIGHT
DOWN THERE.
