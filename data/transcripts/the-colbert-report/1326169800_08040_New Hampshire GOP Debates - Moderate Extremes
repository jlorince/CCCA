>> WHO CAN BLAME THEM.
>> AND FOLKS, THE OTHER
CANDIDATES SAID THINGS BUT I
DON'T CARE.
BECAUSE I WAS WANTED RED
MEAT, GINGRICH FEASTING ON
TARTAR YOU KNOW HE'S TENDER
BECAUSE MORE MONDAYS ARE
MILK FED.
BUT EVERYTHING THEY SAID IN
THESE DEBATES WAS JUST
MIDDLE OF THE ANTIABORTION
BAN GAY MARRIAGE OBAMA IS A
SOCIALIST ROAD.
I BLAME IT ALL ON MODERATE
NEW HAMPSHIRE.
>> JIM.
>> IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,
INDEPENDENTS CAN VOTE IN
EITHER PARTY'S PRIMARY.
SO IT'S A MORE MODERATE
STATE.
>> USUALLY THE SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE GOES
TO IOWA.
THE MORE MODERATE CANDIDATES
ARE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
>> NEW HAMPSHIRE IS FAR MORE
NORTHEASTERN MODERATE.
>> Stephen: SO NO SURPRISE
THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE IS MORE
MODERATE ON SOCIAL ISSUES.
AFTER ALL, FOR THE PAST 200
YEARS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S BEEN
69ING VERMONT.
SO THEY'RE VERY HAPPY
TOGETHER.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT'S A COMMITTED
STABLE RELATIONSHIP.
SO NATURALLY THE CANDIDATES
ARE TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE
VOTERS IN THE GRANITE STATE.
WITCH HUNTSMAN HAS DONE BY
ADOPTING THE CHARISMA OF
IGNEOUS ROCK.
NOW I THINK THE CANDIDATES
SHOULD TAKE THEIR LEAD FROM
A NEW BILL INTRODUCED BY NEW
HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICANS.
YOU SEE, LAST YEAR THE
NATIONAL GOP LAWMAKERS IN
CONGRESS CAME UP WITH A NEW
RULE QUOTE REQUIRING THAT
EACH BILL FILED IN THE HOUSE
CITE ITS SPECIFIC
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS
UNDERSTAND THAT AMERICA MUST
REMAIN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
IT WAS WHEN THE FOUNDERS
DRAFTED THE CONSTITUTION IN
1787.
BE GONE YE DEVIL SCROTUM!
(LAUGHTER)
JUST AS HOT AS THE DEVIL'S
SCROTUM.
WELL, NEW HAMPSHIRE
REPUBLICANS ARE TAKING THIS
IDEA TO ITS MODERATE
EXTREME.
BY PROPOSING THAT ALL NEW
LEGISLATION INCLUDE A DIRECT
QUOTE FROM THE MACK THAT
CARTA, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ARTICLE FROM WHICH THE
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OR LIBERTY
IS DERIVED.
YES, THE MAGAZINE THAT CARTA,
THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS OF
ENGLISH BARRONS WRITTEN IN
1215 ORIGINALLY COMPOSED AS
AN OP ED IN RUPERT MURDOCH'S
FIRST PAPER THE YORK POST.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN THIS DOCUMENT CLEARLY
INSPIRED OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS.
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING THAT
JEFFERSON READ MORE THAN THE
MAGAZINE THAT CARTA WAS
SLAVE TALE.
(LAUGHTER)
AS ONE OF THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE'S BILLS AUTHORS
PUT IT, EVERYTHING HAS AN
ORIGIN AND THIS IS PART OF
THE ORIGIN OF WHAT WE HAVE
IN OUR COUNTRY.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OLDER
THAN THE CONSTITUTION BUT
THE SAME THOUGHT IS THERE.
YES, 572 YEARS IS A LITTLE
BIT OLDER THAN THE
CONSTITUTION.
BUT IT STILL APPLIES.
REMEMBER THE MAGAZINE THAT
CARTA WAS WRITTEN BY ANGRY
RICH MEN WHO BELIEVED THEIR
RULER WAS AN IL LEGITMENT
USURPER.
SO I HOPE THE CANDIDATES
WILL U THE MACK THAT CARTA
TO APPEAL TO THE FAMOUSLY
MODERATE NEW HAMPSHIRE
REPUBLICANS.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY,
INDEPENDENCE MAY QUESTION
YOUR TIES TO WALL STREET, SO
PROMISE TO CRACK DOWN ON
PREDATORY LENDING BY CITING
MAGNA CARTA SECTION 11, IF A
MAN DIES OWING MONEY TO JEWS,
HIS WIFE MAY HAVE HER DOWER
AND PAY NOTHING FOR THE DEBT
PROMISED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALTHOUGH AND I CANNOT STRESS
THIS ENOUGH, THAT PROBABLY
WON'T GO OVER AS WELL IN
FLORIDA.
AND RICK PERRY, YOU NEED TO
SHOW NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT YOU
GOT FOREIGN POLICY CHOPS.
SO STAND FIRMLY BEHIND
SECTION 58 OF THE MAGNA
CARTA WHICH CALLS FOR THE
RETURN OF THE SONS OF LIEU
"ELLEN" AND ALL WELSH-- COME
ON!
IT IS DAY 290,936 OF THE
WELSH HOSTAGE CRISIS.
LET OUR LONG BOWMAN GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YES.
AND RON PAUL, YOU SHOULD
DRESS UP AS MERLIN.
NOW.
LET INTO GOLD, LEAD INTO
GOLD.
NOW BASING ALL YOUR LAWS ON
13th CENTURY ENGLISH
TREATIES SITS MODERATE NEW
HAMPSHIRE-- FITS MODERATE
NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT SOUTH
CAROLINA IS NEXT SO THEY'RE
GOING WANT TO GO BACK EVEN
FURTHER.
SOUTH CAROLINA IS A BIG
MILITARY STATE SO NEWT
GINGRICH TRY CITING ROMAN
LAWMAKER CATO THE ELDER
SPEECHES AGAINST CARTAAGE I
THINK WE STAND WITH VIPIO
AFRICANNUS TO HELP HANNIBAL
IN CROSSING THE ALL S AND
IMPOSE SANCTIONS TO KEEP
PARTHIAN FROM ACQUIRING
PARKY DETERMINE TECHNOLOGY.
AND RICK SANTORUM WHEN YOU
GET TO FLORIDA, ARE YOU
GOING TO WANT TO PITCH YOUR
REPLACEMENT FOR OBAMA CARE
SO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO
THE BABYLONIAN CODE OF
HAMARABBI.
AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH
FOR A TOOTH THAT COVERS BOTH
VISION AND DENTAL.
OF COURSE, AS THE PRIMARIES
GO ON THE CANDIDATES WILL
NEED TO CITE OLDER AND OLDER
STUFF LIKE CAVE PAINTINGS
AND WHATEVER WAS IN THE
POCKETS OF OCTI THE ICEMAN
BECAUSE WHEN ARE YOU A
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE THE
ONLY WAY TO LEAD AMERICA NOT
FUTURE IS BY TYING YOURSELF
TO THE DI
