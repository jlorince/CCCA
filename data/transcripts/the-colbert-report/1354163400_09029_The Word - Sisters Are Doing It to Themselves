GAMBLES, I'M GOING TO KEEP MY MONEY SAFE IN THE STOCK MARKET.
(LAUGHTER) NATION -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, THERE IS A WAR ON TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IN THIS
COUNTRY DID YOU KNOW MANY OF THOSE BRIDES AND GROOMS ON THE TOP OF WEDDING CAKES AREN'T
LEGALLY MARRIED?
YOU'RE FROSTING IN SIN!
NOW THE THREAT TO TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE COUPLE.
>> THE IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE AMONG WOMEN ROSE 9 PERCENTAGE POINT FROM 1997 FROM 28% TO 37%.
BUT THOSE WOMEN AREN'T FINDING MEN TO MARRY.
APPARENTLY BECAUSE MEN ARE LESS INTERESTED, DROPPING FROM 35% TO 29%.
>> Stephen: SHOCKING!
WOMEN WANT TO GET MARRIED MORE THAN MEN DO.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S FROM THE SAME RESEARCHERS WHO FOUND THAT WOMEN TEN TO SCRATCH THEIR BALLS LESS THAN MEN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) TRUE.
SHOCKING.
ARE THESE CHILLING MARRIAGE STATISTICS MEAN THERE ARE MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO MAY NEVER
WALK DOWN THE AISLE, AND THAT BRINGS US TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SISTERS ARE DOING IT TO THEMSELVES.
FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS OF THE WOMAN, I ALWAYS TURN TO ONE SOURCE:.
I TURN TO FOX NEWS.
>> THEIR WEB SITE RECENTLY ADDRESSED WHY SO MANY WOMEN CAN'T GET MARRIED.
ACCORDING TO FOX CONTRIBUTORS, IT'S ALL PART OF THE WAR ON MEN.
SHE WRITES "I'VE ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLED UPON A SUBCULTURE OF MEN WHO'VE TOLD ME THEY'RE NEVER
GETTING MARRIED.
WHEN I ASK THEM WHY THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME: WOMEN AREN'T WOMEN ANYMORE."
RIGHT, WOMEN AREN'T WOMEN ANYMORE!
THAT'S WHY, FELLAS, ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE ADAMS APPLE, OKAY?
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A PRO TIP.
THEN LOOK FOR THE ADAM'S WE US IN.
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, FOOL ME ONCE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, THIS HARD TRUTH HAS BEEN ATTACKED IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
IT EVIDENTLY RUFFLED A LOT OF LADY FEATHERS.
AT LEAST I THINK THEY HAVE FEATHERS, I'M NOT SURE.
I A LOT OF THEM PLUCK THESE DAYS.
OF COURSE, THIS THIN-SKINNED REACTION WON'T SURPRISE BANKER.
IN THE ARTICLE, SHE WROTE THAT "WHAT IF THE DERTH OF GOOD MEN IS WOMEN'S FAULT?
SINCE THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION, MEN HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH BUT WOMEN HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
IN A NUTSHELL, WOMEN ARE ANGRY, THEY'RE ALSO DEFENSIVE." WOMEN ARE ANGRY AND DEFENSIVE.
YOU NEED PROOF?
GO UP TO ANY SINGLE WOMAN AND SAY "THE REASON YOU'RE NOT MARRIED IS BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY
AND DEFENSIVE." (LAUGHTER) AND NOT ONLY -- (APPLAUSE) NOT ONLY ARE TODAY'S SHRILL
HAARPYS SCARING GOOD QUALITY MEN AWAY FROM MARRIAGE, BUT ALSO MAKING THESE MEN DEADBEATS!
BANKER SAYS THE RISE OF WOMEN HAS PISSED MEN OFF AND UNDERUNDERMINEDED MEN'S ABILITY
IN THE HOPES OF SOMEDAY SUPPORTING A FAMILY.
MEN WANT TO LOVE WOMEN, NOT COMPETE WITH THEM!
YEAH, MEN HATE WOMEN WHO COMPETE WITH THEM!
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO RARE FOR MEN TO BE ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WHAT MAN WANTS A WOMAN PROVIDING THE MONEY WHILE HE STAYS HOME TO DO WHAT?
WITNESS HIS CHILD TAKING ITS FIRST STEPS?
I MEAN, PEOPLE BEFORE AND, FRANKLY, BABIES AREN'T THAT GOOD AT IT.
(LAUGHTER) MEN WANT PAPERWORK!
WE WANT A GRINDING COMMUTE TO SIT IN THE CUBE = ALL DAY LONG TAKING CRAP FROM FROM FROM THAT
JERKOFF RICK!
(LAUGHTER) LUCKILY BANKER SEES A WAY TO LIBERATE WOMEN AND MEN FROM THESE LIBERATED WOMEN.
ALL THE LADIES HAVE TO DO IS "SURRENDER TO THEIR NATURE, THEIR FEMININITY, AND LET MEN
SURRENDER TO THEIRS.
IF THEY DO, MARRIAGEABLE MEN WILL COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK." YES, JUST SURRENDER AND THOSE
MEN WILL COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK LIKE COCKROACHES IN A DARKENED CRAB SHACK.
(LAUGHTER) BUT LADIES, LADIES, YOU CAN DO MORE BY DOING LESS.
MAYBE STOP VOTING OR STOP TALKING.
I MEAN IS, WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS THINKING?
I MEAN, FOLLOW MISS BANKER'S ADVICE AND YOU SINGLE GALS WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO LIVE OUT
EVERY WOMAN'S WILDEST DREAM: MARRYING A MAN WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING.
AND AS A MAN ON BEHALF OF WOMEN EVERYWHERE, THANK YOU, SUSAN BANKER.
I TRUST YOU WILL LEAD THE CHARGE BY GETTING OUT OF THE WRITING BUSINESS CLEARLY IT'S NOT IN
YOUR NATURE.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BAC
