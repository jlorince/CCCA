ALL THESE PEOPLE DOWN AT THE

THAT'S WHY I HAVE A SUPERPAC.
WHY WOULDN'T A CORPORATION GIVE
MONEY?

GIG IN A WAY THAT THEIR NAME IS
PUBLICLY DISCLOSED.
PEOPLE MIGHT OBJECT TO WHAT
THEY'VE DONE.
THEIR SHAREHOLDERES, THEIR
CUSTOMERS.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, SO THAT'S
WHERE A C-4 COMES IN.
A CORPORATION OR INDIVIDUAL CAN
GIVE TO A C-4 AND NOBODY GETS TO
KNOW THEY IT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> HOW CAN I GET ONE.
>> AND THAT MONEY CAN BE USED
FOR POLITICS.
>> Stephen:  GREAT, THAT'S
GOOD, TOO.

FOR YOU.

SHELL CORPORATION FILED IN
DELAWARE.
OKAY, I GOT THIS.
SO NOW I HAVE A C-4?

DIRECTORS MEETING.

SENSITIVE ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT
DOWN THERE.
ALL RIGHT, CALL TO ORDER.
LET'S COTHIS THING.
>> ALL RIGHT, SO, THIS SAYS THAT
YOU ARE THE SOLE DIRECTOR OF THE
CORPORATION.
>> Stephen:  I AM.

YOURSELF PRESIDENT, SECRETARY,
AND TREASURER.
>> Stephen:  SOUNDS LIKE A
GREAT BOARD.
>> AND ARE YOU AUTHORIZING THE
CORPORATION TO FILE THE PAPERS
WITH THE I.R.S. IN MAY, 2013.
>> Stephen:  SO I COULD GET
MONEY FOR MY C-4, USE THAT FOR
POLITICAL PURPOSES AND NOBODY
KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL
SIX MONTHS AFTER THE ELECTION.

WHO YOUR DONORS ARE.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE RESTRICTION.

WITHOUT IT, HERE'S WHO GAVE ME
MY MONEY.
WITH IT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOUR MOTHER GAVE ME MY MONEY.
WELL, I LIKE THAT, TREV.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY, OKAY, SO NOW I CAN GET
CORPORATE, INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS
OF UNLIMITED AMOUNT FOR MY C-4.
WHAT CAN I DO WITH THAT MONEY?
>> WELL, THAT C-4 COULD TAKE OUT
POLITICAL ADS AND ATTACK
CANDIDATES, OR PROMOTE YOUR
FAVORITE ONES, AS LONG AS IT'S
NOT THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE FOR
SPENDING ITS MONEY.
>> Stephen:  THE PRINCIPAL
PERSON IS AN EDUCATIONAL ENTITY,
RIGHT.
I WANT TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC OF
WHAT PEOPLE CAUSE EARTHQUAKES.
>> THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME
C-4s DOING THAT K-I TAKE THE
C-4 MONEY AND DONATE IT TO MY
SUPERPAC?

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND
MONEY LAUNDERING?
