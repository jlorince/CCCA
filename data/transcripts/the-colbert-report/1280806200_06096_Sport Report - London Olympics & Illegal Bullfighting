[APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, NFL TRAINING CAMP HAS
STARTED, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS: AT LEAST I HOPE YOU DO
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
NATION, IT'S BEEN ONLY FIVE
MONTHS SINCE I WAS IN VANCOUVER
FOR THE 2010 GAME, AND MY
OLYMPIC FEVER HAS ALREADY BROKEN
OUT AGAIN.
WHY DID I SHARE THAT DRINK WITH
BOB COSTAS?
HE CLAIMED HE GOT IT FROM THE
MOOSE.
AND I AM ALSO SO PSYCHED ABOUT
THE 2012 GAMES IN LONDON.
IN MAY ORGANIZERS UNVEILED THE
OFFICIAL GAMES MASCOTS, WHO
TRULY EMBODY THE OLYMPIC DREAM.
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY A NIGHTMARE
IS A KIND OF DREAM.
AND NOW, WALKING EYEBALLS.
AND NOW THERE'S THIS EXCITING
DEVELOPMENT.
JIM?
>> WHEN LONDON WAS BIDDING FOR
THE 2012 GAME, THE I.O.C. GOT A
TOUR OF A TOXIC WASTE DUMP.
IT'S WHERE LONDON'S OLYMPIC
VILLAGE IS NOW BEING BUILT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE OLYMPIC PART IS BEING BUILT
ON A VAST DUMPING GROUND LACED
WITH RAID YES ACTIVE SOIL, OR AS
THEY CALL IT IN ENGLAND,
BREAKFAST.
[LAUGHTER]
IT TURNS OUT THE STADIUM SITE
CONTAINS ELEVATED LEVELS OF
SODIUM AND RADIUM FROM ILLEGAL
DUMPING IN THE '50s AND
'60s.
OF COURSE, TODAY MOST OF
BRITAIN'S TOXIC WASTE IS DUMBED
ON TO AMERICA.
BRITISH OFFICIALS...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE TAKING THE
NEWS WITH THE TYPICAL STIFF
UPPER LIP, INSISTING THERE IS NO
RISK FROM THE WASTE TO ATHLETES
OR SPECTATORS DURING THE EVENT.
EXACTLY.
IT WILL BE YEARS BEFORE THE
SYMPTOMS EMERGE.
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT ALL GOOD
NEWS.
THE SOIL AT THE SITE IS ALSO
CONTAMINATED WITH OIL, PETROL,
TAR, CYANIDE, ARSENIC AND LEAD,
WHICH GIVES THE CHINESE TEAM AN
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.
BECAUSE THEY TRAIN IN THOSE
CONDITIONS ALL YEAR ROUND.
ANYWAY, THE WHOLE THING COMES AS
A SHOCK.
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN THIS
COMING IN THE CHARMING BRITISH
VILLAGE OF TUMOR-UPON-STRATFORD.
AND I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S SAFE.
SO FAR I HAVE HEARD NOTHING
ABOUT ANY GROTESQUE MUTATIONS.
OH, MY GOD!
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
THEY'RE MUTANTS.
OR THE ROYAL FAMILY'S BEEN
INBREEDING AGAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT UP, OH, WE HAVE ROYAL FANS
IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.
MY APOLOGIES, GUVORNOR.
NEXT UP IT'S BEEN A HUGE YEAR
FOR SPANISH SPORTS OR ESPAGNA
SPORTS.
SPAIN'S SOCCER TEAM WON THE
WORLD CUP, RAFAEL NADAL
CONQUERED WIMBLEDON, ALBERTO CON
TO DOOR WON THE WORLD DE FRANCE
AND JAVIER BARDEB WON THE
SMOLDER.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR
SETBACK.
>> THE CONTROVERSIAL TRADITION
OF BULLFIGHTING IS NOW ILLEGAL
IN ONE REGION OF SPAIN.
THE CATALONIA REGION, WHICH
INCLUDES BARCELONA.
>> Stephen: I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
BARCELONA SHOULD BE USED TO
HORRORS.
THEIR STREETS ARE ALREADY
RUNNING RED WITH SANGRIA VOMITED
BY THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN
BACKPACKERS.
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, FOLKS,
BARCELONA IS JUST THE SAN
FRANCISCO OF SPAIN WITH A BUNCH
OF LIBERAL ELITES TALKING DOWN
TO THE REST OF SPAIN WITH THEIR
SMUG SPANISH LISP.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HEARTLAND
SPANISH VALUES LIKE MOM AND
APPLE PAELLA.
I'M WITH THE PRO-BULLFIGHTING
COMMUNITY, WHO HAVE CALLED THE
BAN A POLITICAL MANIPULATION AND
THE PROOF IS IN THE HOOF
PUDDING.
WE HAVE ACQUIRED EXCLUSIVE VIDEO
OF THE PARLIAMENTARY
DELIBERATIONS OVER THE LAW.
HERE COMES THE LEGISLATION, AND
THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO ATTACH
AMENDMENTS TO IT, KILL IT IN
COMMITTEE AND SUPPORTERS OF THE
BAN, SILENCE THE OPPOSITION.
