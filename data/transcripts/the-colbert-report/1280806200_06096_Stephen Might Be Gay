WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, I HATE TO SAY IT, BRACE
YOURSELF.
THE GAY AGENDA HAS STRUCK AGAIN.
THEY ARE FIERCE.
LAST MONTH THE GAY AND LESBIAN
ALLIANCE AGAINST DEFAMATION OR
GLAD ISSUED ITS ANNUAL NETWORK
RESPONSIBILITY INDEX, WHICH
GRADES EACH TV NETWORK ON THEIR
LEVEL OF GAY FRIENDLY
PROGRAMING.
I BELIEVE THEY'RE GRADED ON A
SCALE OF FAILING TO BRAVO.
[LAUGHTER]
AND OUT OF THE MAJOR NETWORKS,
ONLY CBS RECEIVED A FAILING
GRADE.
COME ON, GLAD!
HOW MANY EPISODES OF CSI: MIAMI
WHERE HOME SIDAL MANIACS ARE
DRIVEN TO KILL BECAUSE THEY'RE
HERMAPHRODITES IS GOING TO
SATISFY YOU?
I KNOW THE TERM IS HOMOSEXUAL.
NO MORE LETTERS.
I HAVE A GLOSSARY AT THIS POINT.
WELL, SAD TO SAY, CBS
IMMEDIATELY FOLDED AND ANNOUNCED
THAT THEY ARE ADDING GAY
CHARACTERS TO THREE OF THEIR
SHOWS -- "RULES OF ENGAGEMENT,"
"THE GOOD WIFE," AND "[BLEEPED]
WHAT MY DAD SAYS."
SO CONGRATULATION, MR. SHATNER,
ONCE AGAIN YOU'LL BE WORKING
WITH GEORGE TAKAI.
COME ON!
[APPLAUSE]
COME ON!
THANK YOU.
COME ON, CBS.
YOU NEED TO STAND UP TO GLAD
WITH PROUD HETEROSEXUAL
PROGRAMING WITH NO GAY PRESENCE
AT ALL, LIKE "HOW I MET YOUR
MOTHER."
LADIES, I HEAR HE DOESN'T HAVE A
GIRLFRIEND.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOW, NOW THERE IS ONE THING
IN GLAD'S REPORT RIGHT HERE THAT
IS EVEN MORE DISTURBING THAN
THEIR TREATMENT OF CBS.
EVIDENTLY MY SHOW IS NOT SINGLED
OUT FOR INTOLERANCE, WHICH CAN
ONLY MEAN SOMEONE ON MY STAFF IS
GAY.
[LAUGHTER]
WHO COULD IT BE?
KILLER?
NO, NO, NO.
JAY THE INTERN?
NO, THAT'S TOO OBVIOUS.
[LAUGHTER]
MY CAMERAMAN JULIAN?
[LAUGHTER]
NO WAY, NO WAY.
NO WAY.
HE'S A TEAMSTER.
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT, THAT LEAVES
ONLY ME.
NOOOOO!
I CAN'T BE GAY.
I'M A HAPPILY MARRIED
CONSERVATIVE JUST LIKE TED
HAGERTY AND LARRY CRAIG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND I DO SUCH MASCULINE THINGS
LIKE DRINK BEER, BUD LIGHT LIME,
THE MANLIEST FRUIT-FLAVORED DIET
LAGGER ON THE MARKET.
MMM, MMM, MMM.
THAT TASTES NOTHING LIKE A DUDE.
NOT THAT I KNOW.
ALTHOUGH COME THINK OF IT, I AM
FABULOUS DRESSER AND I DID ONCE
WIN A GLAD MEDIA AWARD.
WELL, WHY FIGHT IT.
I'M HERE.
I MAY BE QUEER, I BETTER GET
USED TO IT.
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST SHAVE MY
CHEST AND HIT THE STAIR MASTER
BECAUSE I WANT THE LOOK MY BEST
ON THE COVER OF "PEOPLE"
MAGAZINE.
