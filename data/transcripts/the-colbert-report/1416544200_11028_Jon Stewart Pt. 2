>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACKEVERYBODY.
I'M HERE WITH MY, I'M HERE WITHMY OLD FRIEND AND NEMESIS, ONE
OLD PIECE OF HUMANITY, MR. JONSTEWART.
NOW JON YOU'VE GOT A NEW MOVIE,IT'S CALLED ROSEWATER, OKAY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  I'VE SEEN THEFILM AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM
AND THAT OFFENDS ME.
WHY IS IT THAT YOU CAN DO YOURSHOW, AND I MAY NOT AGREE WITH
YOUR SHOW BUT I THINK YOU DO ITWELL AND YET YOU ALSO ARE NOW
DOING SOMETHING ELSE WELL.
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO STAY INYOUR LANE, RIGHT?
YOU HAVE TO STAY IN YOURGESTATION CRATE, ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MOVE OUTOF YOUR CRATE.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S FOR MY OWN SAFETY BYTHE WAY.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
LAST SUMMER YOU BUGGED OUT.
YOU GREW A BEARD AND WENT TOJORDAN.
>> I DIDN'T EVEN GROW A BEARD,THEY GAVE IT TO ME LIKE A LEI
THEY JUST GIVE IT TO YOU.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S FANTASTIC.
>> A GENTLEMAN GREETED ME, HEPUT THIS ON AND SAID YOU ARE
FREE TO PART WHATEVER WATERS YOUWANT.
NOW THIS IS THE STORY OF A MANNAMED MAZIAR BAHARI
>> YES AN IRANIAN JOURNALIST.LIVES IN LONDON, WENT TO IRAN
THEY ARRESTED HIM, STEPHEN. IN2009.
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT FREEDOM OFEXPRESSION. AND YET ALSO
HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC
>> Stephen:  WE HAVE A CLIPACTUALLY.
LET ME SET THE CLIP UP IF I CAN.>> Stephen: SURE.
>> ALRIGHT, HERE'S THE CLIP. [CROWD CHEERING]
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING.>> FIGHTING BACK.
>> YOU GOING TO GET KILLED >> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
THEY TOOK MY BOAT.>> IT'S NOT RIGHT!
>> WHO ARE YOU TO SAY? YOU HAVEA REAL WEAPON AND YOU REFUSE TO
USE IT>> SO THAT FOOTAGE THAT YOU SAW
USE IT>> SO THAT FOOTAGE THAT YOU SAW
IS ACTUAL FOOTAGE DURING THE2009, THAT ACTUAL AND AS IT
ROLLS A GENTLEMAN GETS KILLED ONTHE RAMPARTS.
IT'S THE REAL FOOTAGE AND HE WASARRESTED HAVING THAT FOOTAGE UP
LOADED TO THE BBC AND BROADCAST.
>> THIS IS THE REASON THEYARRESTED HIM FOR UPLOADING THAT
FOOTAGE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> THEY CITED HIM GOING ON THEDAILY SHOW BEING INTERVIEWED.
>> WHEN HE WAS BEINGINTERROGATED THEY PLAYED FOR HIM
A CLIP.
THEY HAD DONE AN INTERVIEW WITHJASON.
IT'S SOMETHING YOU REMEMBER FROMDOING THOSE ARE.
INTERVIEWING HIM HE SAID I'M ANAMERICAN SPY.
AS A SPY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWCAN YOU TELL ME WHY IRAN'S SO
TERRIFYING.
AND HE GOES THROUGH ALL THEREASONS SAYING WHY AMERICA AND
IRAN ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT.
THEY PLAYED THAT FOR HIM INPRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHY IS AN
AMERICAN SPY TALKING TO YOU IFYOU'RE NOT A SPY.
AND MAZIAR SAID WHY DOES ANAMERICAN SPY HAVE A TELEVISION
SHOW.
AND I BELIEVE IT WENT DOWNHILLFROM THERE.
[LAUGHTER]>> IS THAT NOT AN EVIL THING FOR
IRAN TO HAVE DONE?
>> THE EVIL IS RELATIVELY RARE.
IGNORANCE IS EPIDEMIC.
I WOULD QUALIFIER THAT ASIGNORANT, YET NOT NECESSARILY
EVIL.
AND WITHIN THE FILM WE SHOW ABROAD SWATH OF IRANIAN SOCIETY
TO SHOW HOW COMPLEX AND NUANCEDAND TEXTURED IT ACTUALLY IS.
IRAN IS NOT NOW, I KNOWYOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BEFORE
THAT YOU VERY MUCH WANT AMERICATO BE THE ONLY COUNTRY.
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU ...
>> Stephen:  THERE IS AMERICAAND THEN THERE ARE COUNTRIES.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S AN ADMIRABLE PLAN.
BUT RATHER THAN, AND AGAIN WEHAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO
SIT DOWN AND HASH THIS OUT.
RATHER THAN KILLING EVERYBODYELSE, WHAT IF WE WERE TO COEXIST
WITH THEM IN SOME TYPE OFFASHION.
>> COEXIST LIKE THAT BUMPERSTICKER THAT PEOPLE HAVE.
>> NOT IN A KUMBAYA BUT NOTNECESSARILY BENDING THEM
TO OUR WILL.>> BUT THEY WILL DO WHAT WE SAY.
[LAUGHTER]>> ARE THERE BETTER WAYS OF
DOING THINGS THAN WE DO THINGS.
OR ARE YOU A BLAME AMERICAFIRST.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.>> WHAT IS IT, STEPHEN?
DO YOU THINK, ARE PEOPLE INIRAN-
[LAUGHTER]>> STEPHEN HOW MANY OF THESE
HAVE YOU DONE. >> THIS IS MY 3,000TH INTERVIEW
FOR ROSEWATER!>> I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ON MY SHOW
BEFORE THE SHOW IS OVER. THIS ISSO LOVELY
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]JON STEWART.
ROSEWATER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
