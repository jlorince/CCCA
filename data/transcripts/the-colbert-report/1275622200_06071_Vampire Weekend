EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE A
HYPER-LITERATE INDY ROCK BACK
KNOWN FOR ITS AFRO-POP
SENSIBILITY.
I'LL ASK THEM TO EXPLAIN WHAT I
JUST SAID.
PLEASE WELCOME VAMPIRE WEEKEND.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME.
CHRISTOPHER AND CHRIS.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
IT TOOK ME WEEKS TO MEMORIZE
THAT.
THANKS FOR COMING ON, YOU GUYS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> STEPHEN: YOU GUYS ARE LIKE IT
ON A STICK.
YOU'RE THE LATEST, GREATEST.
THANK YOU FOR DRESSING UP.
>> IN PROBLEM.
>> STEPHEN: I REALLY APPRECIATE
IT.
NOW, YOUR NEW ALBUM IS CALLED
"CONTRA."
IT CAME OUT IN JAB.
"CONTRA."
CONTRA MEANS AGAINST.
WHAT ARE YOU AGAINST?
>> WELL, WE'D SAY
CLOSED-MINDEDNESS.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: I REJECT THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> BUT DON'T YOU LOVE FREEDOM,
STEPHEN?
>> STEPHEN: OF COURSE I LOVE
FREEDOM, AS I SEE FIT.
>> FAIR ENOUGH, FAIR ENOUGH.
>> STEPHEN: IF I CAN FIT FREEDOM
INTO MY SCHEDULE.
NOW, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN... YOUR
STYLE HAS BEEN CALLED '80s.
LANDS END CATALOG.
>> SOMETIME, YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: DOES "CONTRA" REFER
TO THE SANDINISTAS, THE CONTRAS
IN THE 1980s?
OR IS THAT TOO HIGH BROW FOR YOU
GUYS?
>> NO, I MEAN, WHEN YOU USE THE
ALBUM "CONTRA," YOU HAVE TO BE
AWARE A LOT OF PEOPLE,
ESPECIALLY SOMEWHAT OLDER
PEOPLE... PEOPLE WAY OLDER THAN
ME.
>> OLDER THAN YOU, BUT THERE'S
IN WAY THAT OBVIOUSLY EVEN
THOUGH I THINK WE THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT, THERE'S IN WAY WE'RE
TRYING TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH
THE THE SEEK RATTED REAGAN WAR.
>> STEPHEN: WHY NOT?
I WOULD ALIGN MYSELF WITH REAGAN
ANY POSSIBLE WAY I COULD.
>> SURE.
>> STEPHEN: YOU WERE VAMPIRE
WEEKEND BEFORE THE VAMPIRE
CRAZE.
>> WAY BEFORE.
>> STEPHEN: ARE YOU PISSED OFF?
>> WELL.
>> STEPHEN: THEY THINK YOU'RE
BEING OPPORTUNISTIC, THAT YOU'RE
JUST JUMPING ON THE VAMPIRE
THING.
>> WELL, WE'VE NEVER USED
VAMPIRE IMAGERY IN EVERYTHING
WE'VE DONE.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
YOU COULD ALL BE VAMPIRES.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ROBERT
PATTINSON.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE THE SAME
HYGIENE AS ROBERT PATTINSON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: THAT'S HALFWAY
THERE, GUYS.
THAT'S HALFWAY THERE.
CAN I TAKE YOU TO TASK FOR
SOMETHING FOR A SECOND?
>> SURE.
>> STEPHEN: IN ONE OF YOUR
SONGS, YOU HAVE THE LYRICS, "WHO
GIVES A [BLEEPED] ABOUT AN
OXFORD COMMA."
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, I DO.
SHALL WE EXPLAIN WHAT OXFORD
COMMA IS TO PEOPLE.
>> IT'S TOUGH TO EXPLAIN.
AN OXFORD COMMA WOULD BE A COMMA
THAT YOU PUT BEFORE THE AND OR
THE OR ON THE END OF A LIST.
RED COMMA WHITE COMMA AND BLUE.
>> DO YOU NEED THE COMMA.
>> STEPHEN: YES, YOU DO.
>> WHY
>> STEPHEN: BECAUSE OTHERWISE
IT'S RED, WHITE AND BLUE.
IT'S RED, WHY, AND BLUE.
>> THERE ARE SITUATIONS...
>> STEPHEN: ALL OF THEM EXCEPT
FOR A LAW FIRM.
HAVE YOU HEARD OF STRUNK AND
WHITE, THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE.
I REFER YOU TO PAGE [BLEEPED]
TWO.
IN A SERIES OF THREE OR MORE
TERMS, USE A COMMA AFTER EACH
TERM.
>> YEAH, BUT I MEAN...
>> STEPHEN: MR. WHITE, YOU'VE
HEARD OF HIM.
>> I RESPECT STRUNK AND WHITE,
BUT IT'S JUST PROTOCOL.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S LANGUAGE.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE ALL
PUNCTUATION OUT.
WE'LL BE LIKE THE ROMANS.
>> SOMETIMES WE DO.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
>> WE'RE A BAND.
>> STEPHEN: I WEEP FOR OUR
NATION, BUT I DO ENERGIZE YOUR
MUSIC.
WILL YOU STICK AROUND AND DO ONE
OF YOUR SONGS THAT IS PROPERLY
PUNCTUATED?
>> WE'LL SEE.
