PANCREATIC, OVARIAN AND LUNGCANCER AND IT COSTS THREE CENTS
AND TAKES FIVE MINUTES TO RUN SOIT'S LIKE A DIABETIC TEST STRIP,
YOU TAKE A DROP OF BLOOD AND YOUCAN INSTANTLY DIAGNOSE THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHTPERHAPS EVEN MORE INTERESTING
THAN THE FACT YOU DID IT AT 16,YOU THOUGHT OF IT AT AGE 14?
>> YES, IN MY HIGH SCHOOLBIOLOGY CLASS.
>> Stephen: WHAT OCCURRED TOYOU?
DID YOU GET HIT OVER THE HEADAND HAVE A DREAM ABOUT -- WHAT
DAWNED ON YOU?
>> I WAS READING A SCIENTIFICARTICLE, SNEAKING IT UNDER MY
DESK.
>> Stephen: SO YOU WEREGOOFING OFF LIKE KIDS DO BY
READING SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES.
I KNOW HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMEN.
GO AHEAD.
(LAUGHTER)>> AND WHAT HAPPENED IS WE WERE
LEARNING ABOUT THESE THINGSCALLED ANTIBODIES THAT LOCK A
SPECIFIC PROTEIN.
>> Stephen: DON'T PATRONIZEME, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

HAPPENED -->> Stephen: A TEST TRIP?
LIKE A CREST WHITE STRIP?
DO I PUT THIS ON MY TEETH?
WHAT IS THIS?
>> IT'S LIKE A DIABETIC TESTSTRIP.
IT'S MADE OF A CARBON SUBSTANCETHAT TRACKS CERTAIN PROTEINS OUT
OF YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

>> SINGLE WALL WALLED CARBONNANO TUBES.
LONG THIN TYPES OF CARBONS THATARE 150,000th THE DIAMETER
OF YOUR HAIR.
THEY'RE REALLY SMALL.

STICK IT IN THERE AND YOU TAKETHIS $50 METER AND JUST PUT IT
LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN SEE IF YOUHAVE PANCREATIC CANCER.
>> Stephen: AND DO I?
>> WELL, THERE'S NO BLOOD ONHERE YET.

>> Stephen: SO YOU COULD BUYTHIS ADD RADIOSHACK.
>> I ACTUALLY GOT THIS FROM HOMEDEPOT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOUWHEN YOU GOT INTERESTED IN THIS?
>> I SUPPOSE I STARTED DOINGSERIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WHEN
I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE.
MY MIDDLE SCHOOL MADE ITMANDATORY AND THEY KIND OF LIKE
MADE IT INTO A "HUNGER GAMES"TYPE COMPETITION WHERE --
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> IT WAS A BLOOD SPORT.
THEY HUNG A LAPTOP OVER 300 KIDSAND SAID "WHOEVER WINS GET THIS
IS."

EVIL?
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE THIS IS THE AGE AT WHICH
NORMALLY SUPERVILLAINS MAKE THETURN.
>> NO, RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING ONOPEN ACCESS SO THAT EVERYONE CAN
ACCESS THESE DIFFERENTSCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND SO NO
MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM YOU CANDO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
>> Stephen: DO YOU OWN THIS?
>> YEAH, I HAVE THEINTERNATIONAL PATENT ON THIS
TECHNOLOGY AND -->> Stephen: CHA-CHING, RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE
MONEY FOR ME IT'S ABOUT SAVINGAS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE ALSO A
TEENAGER.
YOU GOT OTHER THINGS YOU'D LIKETO DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING
THIS.
IS IT HARD BEING SOMEBODY WHO'SCOME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT CAN
DETECT CANCER AT THE SAME TIMEYOU JUST ARE JUST A TEENAGER --
LIKE WHEN YOU WATCH "GLEE" DOYOU THINK TO YOURSELF "I JUST
WASTED AN HOUR, VICTIM SAVED TENPEOPLE'S LIVES."
>> NO, I THINK THAT HOUR WASWELL SPENT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
HOWEVER, I DO MAKE UP FOR ITBECAUSE I OFTEN SLEEP OVER IN
THE LAB.
I KIND OF LIKE GO INTO THESTAIRWELL AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF
SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND YOU CANSPREAD THEM OUT INTO A NICE
PILLOW SOMETIMES SO -->> Stephen: WOW.
>> I MISSED MY BIRTHDAY FOR THEPAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: SO YOU DON'T KNOWWHETHER YOU MISSED YOUR BIRTHDAY
OR NOT.
(LAUGHTER)IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SPEND A LOT
OF TIME IN THE LAB WITH ADULTS.
DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME WITHOTHER TEENAGERS?
>> OH, YEAH, I'M NOT LIKE THATWEIRD KID WHO JUST SPENDS ALL OF
HIS TIME IN THE LAB.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT WEIRD.
(LAUGHTER)HOW ABOUT HOPEFUL AND VERY
TALENTED KID WHO SPENDS ALL OFHIS TIME IN THE LAB.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'REHAVING SOME FUN BECAUSE I'VE GOT
