( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, IF YOU'RE PAYINGATTENTION TO THE NEWS, YOU KNOW
THAT AMERICA IS IN DECLINE.
WE ARE CIRCLING THE DRAIN ANDOUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT WE'RE TOO
FAT TO GO DOWN IT.
( LAUGHTER )AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER
THAN BILL O'REILLY.
>> DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIVEYEARS IN OFFICE MEDIAN INCOME
HAS DROPPED, INDIVIDUALAMERICANS ARE LESS SECURE.
THE JOB MARKET REMAINS SLUGGISH.
THE COUNTRY IS WEAKER.
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOWLOOKING FOR HANDOUTS.
THE U.S.A. HAS LOST ITS WILL TOCONFRONT DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.
BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK.
POOR, ILL-EDUCATED WOMEN.
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS CORRUPT.
THE CYNICAL ENTERTAINMENTINDUSTRY PEDALS GARBAGE, CRUDE
BEHAVIOR AT SPORTS ARENAS ISTOLERATED.
>> Stephen:  YES, CRUDEBEHAVIOR IN SPORTS ARENAS.
SO PEOPLE ARE SO IMPOLITE THEYREFUSE TO EVEN PARTICIPATE IN
THE WAVE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND--( APPLAUSE )
O'REILLY KNOWS-- O'REILLY KNOWSTHE SOURCE OF OUR DECLINE.
>> WHY IS OUR NATION IN DECLINE?
TONIGHT I CAN GIVE YOU THIS--EQUALITY IS WHAT IS HURTING
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THE LEFT HAS SEIZED THAT WORD"EQUALITY" TO PUSH ITS
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA.
WE HAVE INCOME EQUALITY.
MARRIAGE EQUALITY.
GENDER EQUALITY.
AND ON AND ON AND ON.
>> Stephen:  YES, INCOME,MARRIAGE, GENDER, ON AND ON AND
ON.
AND YET THOSE LAST THREE DON'TMEAN ANYTHING, BUT THEY DON'T
MEAN ANYTHING EQUALLY.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND BILL LAID OUT WHY FIGHTINGFOR EQUALITY IS POINTLESS.
>> EACH HUMAN BEING IS BORN WITHABILITIES BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL
ABILITIES.
I WILL NEVER HAVE PHYSICALEQUALITY WITH MY FELLOW IRISH
MAN SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
HE'S BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN IAM BY NATURE.
I WILL NEVER BE AS SMART ASEINSTEIN.
AS TALENTED AS MOZART.
OR AS KIND AS MOTHER TERESA.
>> Stephen:  OH, COME ON,BILL, THAT LIST IS TOO MODEST.
YOU'LL ALSO NEVER BE AS FAST ASUSAIN BOLT, AS EMOTIONALLY
MATURE AS A TODDLER, ORUNDERSTAND HOW TIDES WORK AS
WELL AS A MIDDLE SCHOOLER.
YOU'LL NEVER BE AS STRONG AS ASILVERBACKS GORILLA, OR BE ABLE
TO CAMOUFLAGE YOURSELF AS WELLAS A FLOUNDER OR HOLD A SMALL
SACK OF PAPERS TOGETHER AS WELLAS A BINDER CLIP OR HAVE THE
FUEL EFFICIENCY AND SMOOTHHANDLING OF THE 2014 TOYOTA
AVALON.
O'REILLY'S LOGIC IS AIRTIGHT.
SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT SOMETHINGS THAN OTHER PEOPLE ARE AT
THAT THING.
SO TRYING TO ACHIEVE EQUALITY ISUNNATURAL.
TAKE INCOME INEQUALITY.
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL IS TALLER THANBILL O'REILLY.
THEREFORE, THE RICHEST 1% OFAMERICANS SHOULD CONTROL 40% OF
THE NATION'S WEALTH.
( LAUGHTER )AND BILL IS NOT QUITE AS GOOD
LOOKING AS GEORGE CLOONEY, SOMEN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO
MARRY EACH OTHER, NOT EVEN BILLAND GEORGE WHICH IS TOO BAD
BECAUSE THE KIDS WOULD BEBEAUTIFUL.
( LAUGHTER )THE POINT IS IF BILL O'REILLY IS
NO EINSTEIN-- AND I THINK WE CANALL AGREE HE'S NOT-- THEN
EQUALITY IS FOREVER OUT OF OURREACH.
>> THE TRUTH IS THERE WILL NEVERBE EQUALITY IN THIS WORLD.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, AN OPIUM-LACEDDREAM.
>> Stephen:  YES, I BELIEVETHAT'S WHAT DR. KING WAS TALKING
ABOUT IN HIS "I HAVE ANOPIUM-LACED DREAM" SPEECH.
COME ON!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THERE AREN'T ANY MOUNTAINTOPS ON
THE WASHINGTON MALL.
THAT GUY WAS TRIPPING BALLS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
