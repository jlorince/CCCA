THIS IS MY LAST SHOW BEFORE
SUNDAY'S SUPER BOWL AND I
HAVE ALREADY STARTED
PREPARING MY SEVEN LAYER
DIP.
BEEF, CHEESE, SOUR CREAM,
CHILI PEPPERS, PANCAKE
BATTER AND LIPITOR.
THIS IS THE SPORE REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SUPER BOWL EDITION, NATION
THIS YEAR'S GAME BETWEEN THE
GREEN BAY PACKERS AND THE
PITTSBURGH STEELERS IS SURE
TO BE A THRILLER.
BOTH TEAMS ARE A CREDIT TO
THE DEFUNCT INDUSTRIES THAT
ARE THEIR NAME SAKES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE
SUPER BOWL-- OH, I'M SORRY,
I FORGOT TO FEED MY NFL
ROYALTY METER.
THE NFL IS EXTREMELY
PROTECTIVE OF THEIR BRAND SO
BEFORE I CAN EVEN TALK ABOUT
THE NFL I NEED TO PAY.
HOLD ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR
LICENSING FEE.
YOU HAVE 2 MINUTES.
REMAINING.
>> Stephen: AND THAT, AND
THAT FEE IS JUST TO TALK
ABOUT THE NFL.
THE FEES FOR THE FOOTAGE ARE
SO HIGH I CAN'T EVEN SHOW
YOU JETS HIGHLIGHTS.
INSTEAD I HAVE TO SHOW YOU
THIS.
GOT TO ADMIT, NOBODY MOVES
AROUND IN THE POCKET LIKE
MARK SANCHEZ.
BUT YOU KNOW, FOLKSIX DON'T
MIND PAYING THE LICENSING
FEE.
THE NFL SHOULD PROFIT ANYWAY
THEY CAN.
WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO
EXCITED ABOUT THEIR NEWEST
MONEYMAKER AS REPORTED BY W
FAA-TV DALLAS'S NEWS LEADER.
>> YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO MAKE IT TO THE SUPER BOWL
AT THE COWBOY STADIUM.
TODAY THEY ANNOUNCED THEY
WILL SELL TICKETS TO AN
OUTDOOR PLAZA FOR 200
DOLLARS.
FANS WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE
GAME ON VIDEO SCREENS, AND
WON'T BE ABLE TO GO INSIDE.
>> YEAH!
>> IT'S LIKE YOU'RE AT THE
SUPER BOWL BUT FORGOT YOUR
TICKETS.
IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH 200
SMACKERS.
I MEAN IT'S NONE OF THE
HASSLE OF SEEING THE GAME
LIVE BUT ALL OF THE FUN OF
HOURS OF TRYING TO GET OUT
OF THE PARKING LOT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE BIG DRAW THIS SUNDAY
ISN'T EVEN THE FOOTBALL GAME,
IT'S RONALD REAGAN'S 100th
BIRTHDAY, WHOO!
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME
TRICKLE DOWN!
THE FESTIVITIES, COME ON.
WE STILL LOVE THEM.
THE FESTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE
A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO RONNIE
AND WHATEVER IS IS GOINGING
TO BE, CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH.
I WILL NOT BE SATISFIED
UNLESS THE REAGAN TRIBUTE
TAKES UP THE FULL HALFTIME
SHOW AND THE THIRD QUARTER.
WITH ALL OF THE GREATEST
SPEECHES RECITED BY THE
BLACK-EYED PEAS, WILL I AM
CAN BE REAGAN, FERGIE CAN BE
NANCY AND APL.DE.AP CAN BE
OLIVER NORTH DEAPP.
I ONCE JELLY BEANS, THE
STADIUM COND IMENTS TO BE
DECLARED A VEGETABLE,
CONCESSION SALES TO BENEFIT
THE NICARAGUAN CON TRAS OERZ
I WILL SWITCH TO ANIMAL
PLANET TO WATCH THEIR HALF
TIME SPECIAL, THE DIPPER
BOWL IT IS PUPPIES PLAYING
FOOTBALL DRESSED AS REAGAN.
AFTER ALL, I'VE ALWAYS
