SNEUP WELCOME BACK, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
FOLKS... YOU KNOW, AS I SAID
BEFORE, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK
FROM HOLIDAY BUT AS ALWAYS
WHENEVER I TAKE A BREAK MAJOR
NEWS HITS.
LIKE DICK CHENEY SHOOTING A GUY
IN THE FACE, THE UNDERWEAR
BOMBERS SCORCHING HIS NARDS.
TIGER WOODS SCORCHING HIS NARDS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN.
FOR STARTERS, OVER THE BREAK,
KATY PERRY AND RUSSELL BRAND
SPLIT UP.
I KNOW, SUCH A FAIRY TALE
WEDDING.
BUT LUCKILY THERE'S A NEW
CELEBRITY COUPLE TO TAKE THEIR
PLACE.
MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND LADY GAGA
WHO DELIVERED YET ANOTHER
OUTRAGEOUS OUTFIT.
REALLY.
A FLAG SWEATER ON NEW YEARS?
YOU LOOK LIKE A SLUT!
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE EVEN BIGGER NEWS, FOLKS,
IS THAT A CERTAIN COUNTRY HAS
LOST ITS DEAR LEADER AND I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT THE ELF THAT IS
CURRENTLY RULING CANADA.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR MORE WE GO TO NORTH KOREAN
STATE T.V. PYONGYANG GOVERNMENT
MANDATED NEWS LEADER.
>> (translated): I AM
ANNOUNCING IN THE MOST WOLFE
MIND THAT OUR GREAT LEADER KIM
JONG-IL PASSED AWAY DUE TO A
SUDDEN ILLNESS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, KIM
JONG-IL IS KIM JONG-DEAD.
AND FOLKS...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HIS PLAN HERE, HIS LITTLE SCHEME
HERE IS SO OBVIOUS HE CLEARLY
SLIPPED AWAY WHILE I WAS ON
BREAK BECAUSE HE KNEW I WOULD
GLOAT.
AFTER ALL, I AM HIS NUMBER-ONE
GLOBAL OPPONENT.
JIM?
I.
>> NORTH KOREA, AN ISOLATED
COUNTRY RULED BY A LUNCH LADY IN
MEINEKE OVERALLS.
ELEVATOR REPAIRMAN ONESY.
I WAS GOING TO SEND A GIANT
NOVELTY CHECK UNTIL I REALIZED
FOR KIM JONG-IL THIS IS A GIANT
NOVELTY CHECK.
NOT TO MENTION, FOLKS, I HAVE
PERSONALLY CRUSHED HIS SPIRIT
WITH MY SPOT-ON IMPRESSION.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT EVEN THOUGH KIM JONG-IL WAS
MY SWORN ENEMY, I DO FEEL FOR
THE MILLIONS OF NORTH KOREANS
WHO ARE FULFILLING THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT'S MANDATE TO BE GRIEF
STRICKEN.
SO LET'S TAKE A FOND LOOK BACK
AT THE LIFE OF LIL' KIM JONG-IL.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
