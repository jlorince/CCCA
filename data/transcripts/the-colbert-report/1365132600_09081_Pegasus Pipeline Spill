[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO
THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO
THANK YOU.
THAT SAY WARM N WELCOME, THE
KIND WE WOULD GIVE ANY VISITOR
FROM BUFFALO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO WANTED TO COME DOWN HERE.
WE DON'T BITE MUCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NATION, THERE ARE REASONS FOR
SOME PEOPLE TO BE AFRAID AND
SOME PEOPLE TO IF YOU AROUS AND
I'M ONE OF THEM.
I COULDN'T BE MORE UPSET IF
SOMEBODY PAID ME TO BE ANGRY
WHICH THEY DO.
[LAUGHTER]
AS YOU KNOW, NORMALLY, I DON'T
CARE MUCH FOR THE ENVIRONMENT:
IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO
PROTECT IT, WHY ISN'T IT
SCOTCHGARDED?
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THEN THIS HAPPENED.
>> MAJOR CLEANUP IS UNDERWAY
AFTER AN OIL SPILL IN A SMALL
COMMUNITY IN ARKANSAS.
THE EXXON PIPELINE WAS CARRYING
CANADIAN CRUDE OIL.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, OUR WORST
NIGHTMARE HAS COME TRUE: WE'VE
BEEN HIT BY A MASSIVE CANADA
SPILL.
[LAUGHTER]
WE STILL HAVEN'T RECOVERED FROM
THE LAST ONE WHEN CELINE DION
SPILLED ALL OVER LAS VEGAS.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS AND WE STILL
CAN'T GET THE WHITE LEATHER
PANTS OUT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THIS SPILL, FROM WHAT'S
CALLED "THE PEGASUS PIPELINE",
WASN'T THE SAFE KIND THAT OCCURS
IN THE PRISTINE, IGNORABLE
WILDERNESS.
JIM?
>> CRUDE OIL SPEWED OUT OF THE
EXXONMOBIL PIPELINE COILING ITS
WAY THROUGH A SUBURBAN
NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> Stephen: YES, THE SUBURBS.
SO THIS TIME CLEAN-UP CREWS
WON'T BE SCRUBBING DOWN
OIL-SOAKED SEALS, WE'LL BE
SCRUBBING DOWN OIL-SOAKED NEILS.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NONE OF THAT IS WHAT BOTHERS
ME.
MY PROBLEM IS THIS SPILL GIVES
FUEL TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS.
>> PEGASUS IS A PIPELINE WITH A
10TH OF THE CAPACITY OF KEYSTONE
XL.
YOU BUILD KEYSTONE XL, YOU HAVE
A MORE SIGNIFICANT -- A 10 TIMES
MORE SIGNIFICANT RISK IF THERE
IS A SPILL.
>> THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF THE
KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE IS
PERMITTED AND BUILT.
>> THE DANGERS ARE ANALOGOUS.
>> Stephen:  ANALOGOUS ARE THEY?
LET ME TELL YOU HOW I FEEL ABOUT
THAT.
LET'S SEE.
POSSESSING CORRESPONDING
QUALITIES.
SIMILAR TO.
I DISAGREE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THESE CRITICS ARE JUST
BEING ANAPHYLACTIC.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK IT UP.
I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED ABOUT AN OIL SPILL FROM
THIS PEGASUS PIPELINE, OR FROM
THE KEYSTONE XL.
AN OIL SPILL FOR NEVER HAPPEN.
BECAUSE FOR LEGAL AND TAX
REASONS, THE BLACK, STICKY STUFF
IN BOTH PIPELINES ISN'T
CLASSIFIED AS OIL, IT'S DILUTED
BITUMEN.
[LAUGHTER]
SO GOOD NEWS, ARKANSAS!
YOU DON'T HAVE AN OIL SPILL, YOU
HAVE A BITUMEN SPILL!
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S MERELY A COMBINATION OF
HEAVY CRUDE AND SAND MIXED WITH
LIGHT HYDROCARBONS THAT'S
DIFFICULT TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE IT
SINKS IN WATER.
SEE?
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND, AND
INTO THE DRINKING SUPPLY.
[LAUGHTER]
