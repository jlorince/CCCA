YEARS HELPING PEOPLE DISPLACEDBY WAR AND CONFLICT, ABOUT 35
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
THERE WAS CIVIL WAR IN SIERRALEONE AND LIBERIA.
THANK GOODNESS WE ARE THERE, 500STAFF DEPLOYED TO FIGHT
THE EBOLA VIRUS WHICH IS VERYDANGEROUS, KILLED AT LEAST 5,000
PEOPLE.
THE SITUATION THERE IS MANYTIMES WORSE THAN THE OFFICIAL
FIGURES SUGGEST.

THERE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE-- ANDTHAT'S GREAT-- TO GO OVER THERE
AND HELP THOSE PEOPLE, WHYSHOULD WE LET YOU BACK INTO
WESTERN COUNTRIES THAT DON'THAVE EBOLA.
AREN'T YOU A DISEASE VECTOR NOW?
>> I'M NOT.
IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION ANDLET ME ANSWER WHY. I DIDN'T GO
THERE TO SEE PATIENTS. I WENTTHERE TO MEET OUR
STAFF, TO SUPPORT THE WORKTHEY'RE DOING TO, MEET THE
GOVERNMENTS THERE, TALK ABOUTWHAT THEY'RE DOING, SO I COULD
COME BACK HERE AND GIVE PEOPLETHE REAL FACTS ABOUT THE
SITUATION.
WHICH IS THAT WHILE THESITUATION THERE IS MANY TIMES
WORSE THAN THE OFFICIAL FIGURESSUGGEST, THE SITUATION HERE IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, AND MANYTIMES BETTER THAN THE GENERAL
LEVEL OF HYSTERIA THAT YOU'VEHEARD IN THE MEDIA AND
ELSEWHERE.

AND SANITATION AND EVENTUALLY,BECAUSE THESE CIVIL WARS GO ON
FOR YEARS, HELP PEOPLE WITHECONOMIC LIVELIHOOD TO STAND ON

AND I'M VERY, VERY PROUD THAT WEGOT 12,000 STAFF AROUND THE
WORLD, AMERICANS, BUT ALSOMAINLY PEOPLE FROM THOSE
COUNTRIES, WHETHER IT'S HELPINGWITH EDUCATION IN AFGHANISTAN,
WHETHER IT'S GETTING MEDICALSUPPLIES INTO SYRIA.
THESE ARE LOCAL PEOPLE WHO WE'REEMPLOYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THE MOST WAR-TORN, MOSTVULNERABLE, THE MOST DANGEROUS
PARTS OF THE WORLD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE MOSTWAR-TORN, MOST DANGEROUS PART OF
THE WORLD RIGHT NOW?

IT'S A COUNTRY OF 22 MILLIONPEOPLE.
10.6 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEENDISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES.
THREE MILLION REFUGEES IN THENEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.
IN JORDAN, YOUR SECOND CLOSESTALLY IN THE REGION, COUNTRY OF
SIX MILLION PEOPLE, OVER AMILLION REFUGEES.
THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE OF BRITAINCOMING TO AMERICA.
JUST IMAGINE -->> Stephen:  THEY TRIED THAT
AND WE KICKED THEIR ASS.
>> EXACTLY.
( APPLAUSE )>> Stephen: GLOBALLY, HOW MANY
REFUGEES ARE THERE OUT THERERIGHT NOW?

WHETHER INSIDE THEIR OWN COUNTRYOR OVER A BORDER, 52 MILLION
PEOPLE LAST YEAR.

>> Stephen: WHAT IF THEY ALLCONVERTED TO JUDAISM?
DOESN'T ISRAEL HAVE TO TAKETHEM?
>> THE TRAGEDY IT IS A LOT ARELEFT IN REFUGEE CAMPS, IN URBAN
AREAS, LEFT IN LIMBO.
THEY'RE ALMOST LEFT WITHOUT AFUTURE AT ALL AND OUR JOB IS TO
MAKE SURE WE GIVE THEM A MODICUMOF DIGNITY, WE HELP THEM
SURVIVE.
WE HELP THEM TRY AND GAIN SOMECONTROL OVER THEIR SHATTERED
LIVES.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKEIT COULD BE A DANGEROUS JOB AT
TIMES.
>> IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
AND THE COURAGE, ONE OF THE MOSTINSPIRING THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN
OVER LAST YEAR, I'VE BEEN INTHIS JOB FOR ABOUT A YEAR, THE
MOST INSPIRING THING IS THECOURAGE OF OUR FRONT LINE
WORKERS WHO SAY EVEN WHEN THEIRCOLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN KILLED,
WE'VE HAD TRAGICALLY EARLIERTHIS YEAR IN SOUTH SUDAN, THE
FAMINE SITUATION ON THE HORIZON,WE HAD TWO PEOPLE KILLED, TWO OF
OUR STAFF KILLED, EVEN THOUGHTHEY WERE INSIDE A U.N.
COMPOUND.
AND I WENT TO VISIT SOME OF THESURVIVORS, AND THE-- A WOMAN IN
CHARGE OF OUR TEAM IN SOUTHSUDAN HAD JUST COME BACK FROM
VISITING HER FAMILY IN UGANDA,AND SHE SAID TO ME, "I'M
DETERMINED TO COME BACK BECAUSETHESE PEOPLE HERE DESERVE SOME
HELP."
