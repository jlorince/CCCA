EXISTENCE OF SEATTLE.
(LAUGHTER) THESE GAY SITCOM CHARACTERS OR HUMORSEXUALS ARE A MENACE TO SOCIETY.
THEY SEDUCE NICE THINKING THAT GAYS ARE JUST LIKE US,
NORMAL PEOPLE WITH REAL RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON LOVE AND MUTUAL RESPECT.
IT IS DISGUSTING.
WORST OF ALL, THE GUY WHO PLAYED WILL, ERIC McCORMACK,
HE'S NOT EVEN GAY.
THEY'RE INDOCTRINE ATING US WITH A GAY CHARACTER PIGGYBACK ON A STRAIGHT MAN
WHICH IS EVERY GAY MAN'S FANTASY.
(LAUGHTER) OKAY?
HERE'S ITS DEAL.
REAL MEN KNOW-- REAL MEN KNOW THAT MEN DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER.
THEY ARE BROS WHO ENGAGE IN HORSEPLAY.
SO TO REBALANCE THE NATURAL MORAL ORDER OF TELEVISION, I HAVE WRITTEN A NEW STRAIGHT
SITCOM ABOUT TWO STRAIGHT GUYS NAMED WILL & GRACEON WHO ARE ALWAYS ON THE PROWL FOR THE LADIES.
ONE OF THEM HAS A CAT AND THE OTHER ONE HAS A DOG,
WHICH IS WHY THE SHOW IS CALLED PUSSYHOUNDS.

GAYS AND LESBIANS.
>> Stephen: BUT ERIC, IT'S IT'S-- THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH TOLERANCE TO GO AROUND.
IF WE'RE TOLERANT TO GAIS AND LESBIANS THAT MEANS THERE IS LESS TOLERANCE LEFT
OVER FOR STRAIGHT PEOPLE.
