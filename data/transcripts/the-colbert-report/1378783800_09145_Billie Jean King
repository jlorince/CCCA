THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME IS"I UNDERESTIMATED YOU."
I COULDN'T WAIT TO TELL MY DADWHAT HE SAID!
HE WOULD ALWAYS TELL US "RESPECTYOUR OPPONENTS, NEVER, EVER
UNDERESTIMATE THEM."
IT WAS LIKE HAVING WON THEPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
EVERYBODY RAN ON THE COURT ANDTHE WOMEN WERE PUMPED UP AND IT

FEELING VINDICATED.

>> IT WAS A PLATFORM.
TENNIS WAS A PLATFORM FOR ME TOREALLY DO SOMETHING I WANTED TO
DO SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD ANDTHAT IS FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN ANDGIRLS, BOYS AND WOMEN.
MY OLDER BROTHER WAS A MAJORLEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER, RANDY
MOFFAT, PLAYED WITH THE SANFRANCISCO GIANTS, A RELIEF
PITCHER AND A GOOD SLIDER.
NOT A GOOD CURVEBALL HE TOLD ME.
SO ANYWAY, I ALWAYS -- I ALWAYSWANT BOTH GENDERS TO CHAMPION
