OF COURSE BACK HERE IN THE
STATES, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
OBSESSED WITH THE GEORGE
ZIMMERMAN MURDER TRIAL.
PEOPLE ARE TRACKING IT LIKE IT
WAS A BLACK TEENAGER IN A GATED
COMMUNITY.
AND ON SATURDAY... I KNOW.
PEOPLE ARE EXCITED.
AND ON SATURDAY, WE GOT JUSTICE.
>> WE THE JURY FIND GEORGE
ZIMMERMAN NOT GUILTY.
>> FOLKS, THIS IS A VICTORY FOR
THE RULE OF LAW.
IN THAT FLORIDA APPARENTLY NO
LONGER HAS RULES OR LAWS.
NOW, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, OF
COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUT
THERE WAS SHOCKED BUT ONE MAN
SAW THIS COMING.
FOX NEWS LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND
INVENTOR OF THE LIP-HOODIE,
GERALDO RIVERA.
>> IT'S A DARK NIGHT.
A 6'2 "HOODIE-WEARING STRANGER
IS IN THE IMMEDIATE HOUSING
COMPLEX.
HOW WOULD THE LADIES OF THAT
JURY HAVE REACTED?
I SUBMIT THAT IF THEY WERE
ARMED, THEY WOULD HAVE SHOT AND
KILLED TRAYVON MARTIN A LOT
SOONER THAN GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
DID.
>> Stephen: GREAT ANALYSIS, AND
IT PROVES THIS WAS A FAIR TRIAL.
AS THE BILL OF RIGHTS CLEARLY
STATES, THE ACCUSED SHALL BE
TRIED BY A JURY OF PEOPLE WHO
WOULD HAVE DONE... WHO WOULD
HAVE DONE THE MURDER FASTER.
BUT, FOLKS, EVEN THOUGH JUSTICE
WAS SERVED THAT DID NOT STOP
SOME AMERICANS FROM RUDELY
ACCEPTING IT BACK TO THE
KITCHEN, TAKING TO THE STREETS
TO PROTEST SO-CALLED RACIAL
INEQUALITY.
KNOCK IT OFF!
BECAUSE YES, AMERICA HAD RACIAL
INEQUALITY BUT BY MY LATEST
CALCULATIONS, IT'S EVIDENTLY...
IT IS NOW A TIE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
STICK WITH ME.
STICK WITH ME.
HERE'S HOW IT BREAKS DOWN.
OBVIOUSLY ZIMMERMAN'S ACQUITTAL
IS SEEN AS A POINT FOR WHITE
PEOPLE.
(DING).
THEN AGAIN, O.J.'S ACQUITTAL WAS
ONE FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
(DING).
OBAMA, WITH TWO BLACK POINTS,
ONE FOR EACH ELECTION (DING,
DING).
AND WHITES LOSE ONE POINT FOR
JOE BIDEN.
(BUZZER) OF COURSE FOR THE
PREVIOUS 43 WHITE PRESIDENTS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOR THE PREVIOUS 4 WHITE
PRESIDENTS, WHITE PEOPLE
ACCUMULATED ONE POINT.
(DING) NOW, JAZZ CLEARLY A POINT
FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
(DING).
BUT WHITE PEOPLE GET A POINT FOR
SMOOTH JAZZ.
(DING) NOW, CRUCIAL.
IN THE CIVIL WAR, WHITE PEOPLE
GET ONE POINT FOR WINNING THE
FIGHT TO END SLAVERY.
(DING) AND ANOTHER POINT FOR
LOSING THE FIGHT TO KEEP
SLAVERY.
(DING).
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
EVIDENTLY NO POINTS FOR BLACK
PEOPLE IN THAT ONE.
ODD TIME TO SIT THINGS OUT.
ANYWAY, AS YOU CAN SEE, AS YOU
CAN SEE, IT'S EVEN NOW.
OKAY?
SO WE CAN JUST STOP THIS WHOLE
RACIAL THING HERE.
WHITE PEOPLE, STOP BEING SO
SCARED WHERE OF YOUNG BLACK MEN.
AND YOUNG BLACK MEN, STOP BEING
SO SCARY.
OKAY.
TAKE SOME PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW WHITE
PEOPLE FEEL AROUND YOU.
OKAY.
LOSE THE HOODIES.
WEAR SOMETHING NONTHREATENING.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
START BUYING YOUR CLOTHES
WHEREVER MARTIN LAWRENCE AND
TYLER PERRY SHOP.
I MEAN, THEY LOOK HARMLESS.
