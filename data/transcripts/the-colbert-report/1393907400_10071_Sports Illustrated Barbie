>> THANK YOU SO MUCH,WELCOME BACK.
NATION, IF YOU CHECK YOURCALENDARS THEN YOU'LL KNOW
THAT MARCH IS WOMEN'SHISTORY MONTH.
AND THERE IS NO GREATEREXAMPLE IN HOW FAR WOMEN
HAVE COME.
THE ANNUAL "SPORTSILLUSTRATED" SWIMSUIT ISSUE.
SWIMSUIT ISSUE HAS LONG BEENA BASTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS
FROM THE OCCASIONAL BLACKMODEL TOLD THAT ONE GIRL WHO
WAS UNDER 5'10.
AND THIS YEAR THEY HAVEACHIEVED A NEW MILESTONE.
>> BARBIE IS POSING FORSPORTS ILLUSTRATE'S 50th
SWIMSUIT ISSUE.
>> THE MAGAZINE CRAFTED APROMO CAMPAIGN AROUND THE
ICONIC DOLL.
>> INSIDE THE MAGAZINE TOPSWIMSUIT MODELS AND BARBIE
DOLLS STRIKE A POSE.
>> Stephen: FOLKS THIS ISTHE PERFECT THING FOR ANY
MAN WHOEVER PICKED UP ASWIMSUIT ISSUE AND SAID I
WISH IT WOULD FEATURE MORETHINGS THAT REMIND ME OF MY
DAUGHTER.
BUT SADLY THERE ARE HATERSOUT THERE WHO WANT TO CRUSH
BARBIE'S MALIBU DREAMHOUSE.
>> A BARBIE DOLL DOESN'THAVE A PLACE IN A MEN'S
MAGAZINE.
IN A MEN'S MAGAZINE THAT ISDEDICATED TO SEXUALIZING
WOMEN.
>> HAVING BARBIE, A LITTLEGIRL'S TOY ON THE FRONT
COVER ONLY SERVES TO FURTHERSEXUALIZATION OF GIRLS
AND OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN.
>> Stephen: NO, THIS IS THEEXACT OPPOSITE OF THE
OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN. IT'STHE
WOMENIFICATION OF OBJECT.
BUT FOLKS-- I DON'T HAVE TOSIT HERE AND DEFEND BARBIE.
BECAUSE BARBIE CAN DEFENDHERSELF AS SHE WROTE WITH
HER TINY GLUED TOGETHERFINGERS IN A FULL PAGE "NEW
YORK TIMES" AD, QUOTE T ISTIME TO STOP BOXING IN
POTENTIAL.
BE FREE TO LAUNCH A CAREERIN A SWIMSUIT, LEAD A
COMPANY WHILE GORGEOUS ORWEAR PINK TO AN INTERVIEW AT
M.I.T.
THE REALITY OF TODAY IS THATGIRLS CAN GO ANYWHERE AND BE
ANYTHING.
EXACTLY.
"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"SWIMSUIT ISSUES ARE ABOUT
ACHIEVING WOMEN'S DREAMS, OFBEING A DESERT EXPLORER OR
AN ASTRONAUT OR HIDING UNDERTHE MATTRESS OF A
13-YEAR-OLD BOY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO
DREAMS, NOT ONLY DOES BARBIEHAVE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED'S
BACK, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED'SGOT HERS.
>> INSIDE DID NOT RESPOND TOOUR REQUEST FOR COMMENT BUT
IN THEIR PRESS RELEASE SAIDSWIMSUIT HAS DELIVERED A
MESSAGE OF EMPOWERMENT,STRENGTH AND BEAUTY.
>> Stephen: YES, EMPOWERMENT.
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MOREEMPOWERING TO A MODEL THAN
BEING REPLACED BY A PIECE OFPLASTIC.
AND BARBIE IS A GREAT ROLEMODEL FOR MODELS.
>> IN SOME WAYS THE PERFECTMODEL.
SHE DOESN'T BLINK, SHEDOESN'T MOVE.
SHE TAKES DIRECTION, TAKESINSTRUCTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YES, SHE DOESN'T
BLINK, SHE DOESN'T MOVE.
SHE'S TOO BUSY BEINGEMPOWERED TO TALK.
AND FOLKS,-- (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND FOLKS, TOPROVE THAT THE "SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED" SWIMSUIT COVERIS NOT ABOUT UNREALISTIC
BODY IMAGE OR SEXUALIZATIONOF CHILDREN'S TOYS, I AM
CALLING ON SPORTSILLUSTRATED TO MAKE NEXT
YEAR'S COVER MODELMRS. POTATO HEAD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BECAUSE HE IS THE PERFECT
MODEL.
YOU CAN CHANGE HER FEATURESWITHOUT PLASTIC SURGERY.
YOU CAN PUT HER EYES ON TOPOF HER HEAD.
YOU CAN PUT HER NOSE WHEREHER EARS ARE.
AND TALK ABOUT SILENT, IF SHEGIVES YOU ANY LIP, YOU CAN
REMOVE HER LIPS.
AND IF THERE'S ANY PART OFHER THE PHOTOGRAPHER DOESN'T
LIKE, YOU CAN JUST PUT ITRIGHT UP HER BUTT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
