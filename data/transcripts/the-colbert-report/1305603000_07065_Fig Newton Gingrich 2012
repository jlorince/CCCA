ME ON TO THE NEXT BIG THING,
NEWT GINGRICH.
>> TO YOUNG PEOPLE, TO 18
AND 20-YEAR-OLD VOTERS, IT
JUST OCCURRED TO ME, HE'S
NEW.
THEY MAY FIND HIM QUITE
COMPELLING.

IS IN TOUCH WITH THE KIND OF
QUESTIONS YOUNG VOTERS ASK.
FOR INSTANCE, WHO IS THAT
LADY?
AND WHY DOES SHE TALK LIKE
SHE'S GIVING ELEC CAN YOU
TION LESSONS ON A YACHT.
PEGGY IS RIGHT.
THE KIDS LOVE THE NEWT.
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF NEWT
SINCE I WAS A KID.
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO NEW
YORK I USED TO GO WATCH HIM
BEING INFLATED FOR THE
THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT THE REAL
REASON, THE REAL REASON NEWT
IS BOUND TO BE A WINNER IS
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO
COURT CORPORATE DONORS.
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT HIS
SUBTLE FUND-RAISING
TECHNIQUE.

HELP SOLVE IT, AMERICAN
EXPRESS HAS HELPED SOLVE IT,
VISA HAS AGREED TO HELP
SOLVE IT.
>> Stephen: WOW THAT IS SOME
WORLD-CLASS NAME DROPPING.
THE MAN IS SMOOTH.
ALMOST AS SMOOTH AS BUD
LIGHT LIME.
HMMMM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HE'S GOING TO
FABRESE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.

>> Stephen: IF ONLY ABRAHAM
LINCOLN HAD SHOWN THE
LEADERSHIP TO NAME CHECK
CORPORATIONS THAT BALDLY
PERHAPS HE COULD HAVE
AVERTED THE CIVIL WAR BY
DECLARING A HOUSE DIVIDE KD
NOT STAND, UNLESS IT'S
CONSTRUCTED WITH-- SATISFACTORY
OAK ROOF BEAMS, CHINAMAN
