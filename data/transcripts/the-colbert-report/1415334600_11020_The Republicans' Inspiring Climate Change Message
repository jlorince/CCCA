>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK.
THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
NATION, NATION, TUESDAY'SELECTION LOSS WAS AN HISTORIC
LOSS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
I'D SAY THEY GOT THEIR ASSESHANDED TO THEM BUT I DON'T
BELIEVE IN HANDOUTS
YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT ASS,DEMOCRATS.
AND THANKS TO THE LOSS, YOUDON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
GLOBAL WARMING ANYMORE BECAUSETHE SENATE SURE WON'T.
>> THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE,CURRENTLY RUN, LIBERAL DEMOCRAT,
GLOBAL WARMING BELIEVER, BARBARABOXER, REPLACED PROBABLY BY
JAMES INHOFE, CONSERVATIVE FROMOKLAHOMA WHO IS AS MUCH OF AN
OPPONENT OR SKEPTIC ABOUT GLOBALWARMING AS THERE IS.
>> Stephen: YES, THE GLOBALWARMING BELIEVER IS OUT AND THE
GLOBAL WARMING SKEPTIC IS IN, SOFINALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL
COMMITTEE CAN FOCUS ON IMPORTANTISSUES LIKE WHO'S STEALING ALL
OUR POLAR BEARS?
AND SENATOR JAMES INHOFE IS NOTYOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL CLIMATE
CHANGE DENIER.
YOU COULD SAY HE WROTE THE BOOKON IT BECAUSE HE WROTE THE BOOK
ON IT.
"THE GREATEST HOAX: HOW THEGLOBAL WARMING CONSPIRACY
THREATENS YOUR FUTURE."
>> Audience: BOO.
>> Stephen: OOH, YEAH.
IT IS EXCITING.
IT'S LIKE HARRY POTTER FORPEOPLE WHO THOUGHT HARRY POTTER
HAD TOO MUCH SCIENCE IN IT.
OF COURSE, NOT ALL REPUBLICANS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ), OF COURSE, NOT ALL REPUBLICANS
ARE AS BOLD AS INHOFE.
IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMINGSO-CALLED EVIDENCE AND ACTUALLY
CALLED EVIDENCE, THEY DEPLOYED ABRILLIANT TACTIC DURING THIS
LAST CAMPAIGN.
CASE IN POINT-- NEWLY ELECTEDTEXAS LAND COMMISSIONER GEORGE
P. BUSH-- NEPHEW OF GEORGE W.
BUSH, GRANDSON OF GEORGE H.W.
BUSH, AND FUTURE FATHER OFGEORGE UNDERSCORE BUSH--
LISTEN TO GEORGE P., ORP.-BIDDY, SPIT SOME NOT-KNOWLEGE
>> HOW BIG A THREAT IS CLIMATECHANGE TO THE TEXAS COASTLINE?
>> THE TEXAS COASTLINE ISIMPACTED BY RISING SEA LEVELS.
AND, AGAIN, THE QUESTION ISWHETHER OR NOT THAT'S MANMADE,
AND I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THESCIENTISTS.
>> BUT YOU DON'T DOUBT HUMANACTIVITY CONTRIBUTES TO CLIMATE
CHANGE?
>> WE'LL SEE IN TERMS OF THESCIENCE, IN TERMS-- THERE'S A
WIDE RANGE THAT HAS BEENDISCUSSED.
AGAIN, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST BYEVERY STRETCH, BUT EVERYWHERE
FROM NO IMPACT AT ALL TO 100%.
>> Stephen: YEAH, HE'S NOSCIENTIST.
HE'S NO SCIENTIST.
IN FACT, I'M IMPRESSED HE WASABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO
FROM 0 TO 100%.
HOW IMPRESSED AM I?
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 0 AND 100%.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND, FOLKS, GEORGE P. NOT ALONE.
>> I'M NOT A SCIENTIST NOR AM IA PHYSICIST.
>> I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO DEBATETHE SCIENCE OVER CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
>> I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.

>> Stephen: YES, EVERYONE WHODENIES MANMADE CLIMATE CHANGE
HAS THE SAME STIRRING MESSAGE--WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ( BLEEP )
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND I HOPE, I HOPE, I HOPE THATTHESE CONSERVATIVE LEADERS CAN
INSPIRE ALL THE CHILDREN OUTTHERE WATCHING TO THINK TO
THEMSELVES, HEY, MAYBE SOME DAYI COULD GROW UP TO BE NOT A
SCIENTIST.
WELL, KIDS, NOW THERE'S A FUNWAY TO EXPLORE YOUR OWN LACK OF
CURIOSITY AT HOME.
IT'S TIME FOR MY EDUCATIONALSERIES "PROFESSOR NOT A

DEPARTMENT TO MAKE THIS ONE FORYOU.

SOME DAY, YOU COULD COMPLETELYLACK ANY UNDERSTANDING OF
SCIENCE AND THEN GROW UP TO BETHE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
