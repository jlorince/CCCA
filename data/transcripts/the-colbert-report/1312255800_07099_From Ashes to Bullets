[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME I'VE
SAID THIS BUT
FOLKS, I'M DOING EVERYTHING I
CAN TO WARD OFF THE COLD HAND OF
DEATH.
THAT'S WHY I WAKE UP EARLY EVERY
MORNING AND EAT 3 PACKS OF
OSCAR MEYER COLD CUTS.
I'M SLOWLY CURING MY ORGANS IN
NITRATES, SO THEY HAVE A SHELF
LIFE OF ETERNITY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT I
AM MORTAL, I THINK I'VE FOUND
THE WAY I'D LIKE TO BE HONORED
WHEN I DIE.
>> AN ALABAMA COMPANY CALLED
HOLY SMOKE IS OFFERING TO TURN
YOUR LOVED ONE'S ASHES INTO REAL
BULLETS THAT CAN BE FIRED.
THEY USE A POUND OF ASHES AND
SMALL PORTIONS PLACED INTO EACH
SHELL OR CARTRIDGE.
THE COMPANY CLAIMS THEIR SERVICE
IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN BURYING
A LOVED ONE.
250 BULLETS WILL COST YOU
$1,250.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A GREAT DAY
FOR AMERICA, BECAUSE WE'RE
FINALLY EXTENDING  2ND AMENDMENT
RIGHTS TO DEAD PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY: "YOU CAN
HAVE MY GUN WHEN YOU PRY IT FROM
MY COLD DEAD HANDS!"
NOW WE CAN FIRE BULLETS
CONTAINING THOSE HANDS, AND
PROBABLY SOME LEG.
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS, THIS IS A GENIUS BUSINESS
MODEL.
YOU PUT 250 ROUNDS INTO THE
HANDS OF A DEVASTATED FAMILY
MEMBER IN AN UNSTABLE EMOTIONAL
STATE, AND SOMEONE MIGHT GET
SHOT.
AND BOOM, NEW CUSTOMER!
[LAUGHTER]
WHO HIS FAMILY CAN HONOR BY
TURNING INTO BULLETS IN ORDER TO
AVENGE HIS DEATH.
CHA-CHING!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.
SHE NEEDS COUNSELING.
[LAUGHTER]
AS HOLY SMOKE FOUNDER CLEM
PARNELL SAID:
"I WANT MY ASHES PUT INTO SOME
TURKEY LOAD SHOTGUN SHELLS.
THAT WAY, I WILL REST IN PEACE
KNOWING THAT THE LAST THING THAT
ONE TURKEY WILL SEE IS ME,
SCREAMING AT HIM AT ABOUT 900
FEET PER SECOND."
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: AND HOW SPECIAL THAT
THANKSGIVING WILL BE FOR CLEM'S
GRIEVING FAMILY?
HE MAY NOT BE THERE WITH THEM AT
THE MEAL, BUT CHANCES ARE, THERE
ARE BITS OF HIM IN THE MEAL.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT'S NOT JUST FOR PERSONAL
REASONS THAT CLEM STARTED THE
COMPANY, HE AND HIS BUSINESS
PARTNER REALIZED THERE WAS
A NEED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL'S
CHOICE IN HOW HIS OR HER LIFE
COULD BE REMEMBERED OR HONORED.
[LAUGHTER]
YES, THERE WAS A NEED!
UNTIL NOW, IF YOU WANTED TO
HONOR NANA'S DYING WISH THAT HER
REMAINS BE USED TO KILL
WILDLIFE, YOU HAD TO LOAD HER
INTO A CIRCUS CANNON AND SHOOT
HER AT A MOOSE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, BRAVO HOLY SMOKE, FOR GIVING
US THE MOST BAD-ASS WAY TO
SCATTER OUR LOVED ONE'S ASHES
SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE URN
GRENADE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
