SO, AS THE HEAD OF ACORPORATION MYSELF WITH THE
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TOMY SHAREHOLDER, TONIGHT I
REGRETFULLY ANNOUNCE THATTHE COLBERT REPORT
INCORPORATED HAS PURCHASEDAN ALPHORN REPAIR SHOP IN
SWITZERLAND, FOR TAXPURPOSES THIS SHOW WILL NOW
BE KNOWN AS THE COLBERTRIIIICOLAAAA.
AND NO ONE BUT NO ONE CANTELL ME THAT THAT IS
UNAMERICAN.
HERE TO TELL ME THAT THAT ISUNAMERICAN, IS SENIOR EDITOR
AT LARGE AT "FORTUNE"MAGAZINE, AUTHOR OF THE
RECENT ARTICLE POSITIVELYUN-AMERICAN TAX DODGES, ALLAN
SLOAN, ALLAN, THANK YOU SOMUCH FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
(APPLAUSE)THERE IT IS, POSITIVELY
UNAMERICAN TAX DODGES,"FORTUNE" MAGAZINE.
OKAY, AL, WHAT IS THE BIGDEAL?
THIS IS JUST A CORPORATIONEXERCISING ITS FIDUCIARY
RESPONSIBILITY TO RETURN THEGREATEST PROFIT FOR ITS
INVESTORS.
WHEN DID FORTUNE BECOME ASOCIALIST MAGAZINE.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY WE'RE ACAPITALIST MAGAZINE.
>> Stephen: GOT A FUNNY WAYOF SHOWING IT, AL.
>> WELL, MORE SO THAN THEYARE.
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY WORRYABOUT THINGS LIKE THE
LONG-TERM FUTURE OF THEUNITED STATES, THE LONG-TERM
FUTURE OF BUSINESS, AND THELONG-TERM FUTURE OF
CORPORATE AMERICA.
AND IF YOU GO AND TALK TOPEOPLE, YOU WILL DISCOVER
PEOPLE ARE ENRAGED BY THIS.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YOU CALLTHIS POSITIVELY UNAMERICAN.
WHY UNAMERICAN.
THESE COMPANIES ARE STILLPATRIOTIC.
BECAUSE WHETHER THEY'REPAYING TAXES OR NOT IN THE
UNITED STATES, I'M SURE THEYWILL STILL USE ALL THEIR
CORPORATE MONEY TO HELPELECT OFFICIALS WHO APPROVE
OF THEIR BEHAVIOR.
(APPLAUSE)>> SO THAT'S VERY TOUCHING.
(LAUGHTER)>> BUT WE HAVE THIS IDEA, OR
I HAVE THIS IDEA THAT TO BEAMERICAN YOU SHOULD ACT LIKE
A CITIZEN.
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST TAKESTUFF FROM THE COUNTRY,
WHICH THESE COMPANIES HAVEDONE, THEN DECIDE YOU DON'T
WANT TO PAY FOR IT, BUT BYTHE WAY WE'RE ACTUALLY ALL
GOING TO STAY HERE.
WE'LL JUST PAY A LOT LESSTHAN WE USED TO, OR MAYBE
NOTHING, BUT WE'LL HAVE ALLTHE BENEFITS OF BEING HERE.
IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIALELECTION, PEOPLE TALKED
ABOUT MAKERS AND TAKERS.
BUT I GUESS BEING A TAKER ISOKAY, IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
SET OF LAWYERS AND CANNOTPAY TAXES IN THE UNITED
STATES.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: YOU RECENTLY
TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESSABOUT THIS ISSUE.
AND YOU HAVE SAID THATCONGRESS CAN DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THESE INVERSIONS.
IS THAT YOUR WAY OF SAYINGTHAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE
ABOUT THESE INVERSIONS?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> SOMETHING CAN BE DONE.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHERSOMETHING WILL BE DONE IS
ANOTHER QUESTION.
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM, IHAVE TO SAY, IS THAT THE
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS,MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT
ACTUALLY BAD PEOPLE, WERESORT OF TALKING TO EACH
OTHER AND SUDDENLY PRESIDENTOBAMA, I HAVE TO SAY, TAKING
LINES THAT WE HAD AND NOTPAYING ANY ROYALTY, HE
TURNED IT INTO A BIGPOLITICAL ISSUE.
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO WONDER IFANY REPUBLICAN CAN ACTUALLY
DO THIS.
>> Stephen: OH, BECAUSEOBAMA GOT HIS OBAMANESS ON
IT.
THEY GOT TO HOSE THAT THINGOFF AND GET IT BACK TO
CONGRESS.
WELL, ALLAN, THANK YOU SOMUCH FOR JOINING ME.
"FORTUNE" MAGAZINE'S SENIOREDITOR AT LARGE, ALLAN
SLOAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
