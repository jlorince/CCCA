>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, BEFORE WE GO, I JUST
WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY YOU
CAN GO TO THE WEB SITE
COLBERT NATION.COM AND SEE A
BONUS SONG FROM BON IVER, A
LIVE VERSION IN THE STUDIO
OF SKINNY LOVE.
IT DID NOT SUCK.
AND JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT
FOR DAY TWO WHEN MY GUEST
WILL BE BOTH FLORENCE AND
THE MACHINE.
THAT'S IT FOR THE REPORT,
