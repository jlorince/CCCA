( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A HARVARD
PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR WHO HAS A
NEW BOOK ABOUT THE CLASSICS.
I'M NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO LISTEN
TO HIM.
I'M JUST GOING TO PICK UP THE "
"CLIFF NOTES" LATER.
PLEASE WELCOME SEAN KELLY!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY!
MR. KELLY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  LET'S GET THE
C.V. OUT HERE.
YOU'RE HEAD OF THE PHILOSOPHY
DEPARTMENT AT HARVARD
UNIVERSITY; IS THAT CORRECT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  YOU HAVE A BOOK
CALLED "ALL THINGS SHINING--
READING THE WESTERN CLASSICS TO
FIND MEANING IN A SECULAR AGE."
FIRST QUESTION, WHAT?
( LAUGHTER )
MY FOLLOW-UP?
WHY?
WHY CAN'T-- WE HAVE MEANING IN
OUR LIVES, DON'T WE?
>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK THAT OUR CULTURE IS SORT
OF SPECIAL.
MY COAUTHOR AND I-- I SHOULD SAY
I'VE COWRITTEN THE BOOK WITH
HUBERT DREYFUSS.
>>
>> Stephen:  HE'S NOT HERE
THOUGH.
>> HE'S NOT HERE
( LAUGHTER )
WE THINK, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
THINK THIS-- THAT OUR AGE IS
SORT OF SPECIAL.
IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO FIND
SMINGZ THAT MATTER IN THEIR
LIVES.
AND THAT MAKES OUR AGE DIFFERENT
FROM A LOT OF THE AGES--
>> Stephen:  PEOPLE HAVE SO
MANY THINGS THAT MATTER IN THEIR
LIVES.
I MEAN, I-- I, FOR INSTANCE,
AM-- I'M GETTING A PAYCHECK.
FOR INTERVIEWING RIGHT NOW, AND
THAT MAKES MY LIFE RICH WITH
MEANING.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT-- WHAT MEANING HAVE WE
LOST?
>> WHAT WE THINK IS WE'VE LOST
THE NOTION OF WHAT'S SACRED IN
OUR EXISTENCE, AND WHAT'S SACRED
IS THE 19th CENTURY GERMAN.
PHILOSOPHER SAID WHAT'S SACRED
IN A CULTURE IS WHATEVER IT IS
YOU CAN'T LAUGH AT, YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO LAUGH AT.
>> Stephen:  THEN EVERYTHING
IS SACRED.
I DON'T BELIEVE LAUGHTER HELPS
AT ALL.
I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SACRED
IN THEIR LIVES.
I'M A CATHOLIC.
THE SEVEN SACRAMENT ARE SACRED
TO ME.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT WE THINK IS ALTHOUGH IT'S
TRUE THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS IN
THE CULTURE HAVE A RELIGIOUS
BELIEF THAT ALLOWS THEM TO
EXPERIENCE THINGS AS MATTERING
TO THEM, THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
DON'T PLAY THE SAME ROLE FOR
THEM THAT THEY USED TO IN THE
PAST.
>> Stephen:  MEANING THAT YOU
JUST DON'T THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE
AN IVORY TOWER LIBERAL?
YOU'RE IN THE TOWER ON TOP OF
THE TOWER.
MAYBE YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES JUST
HAVE, YOU KNOW, ARE EMPTY SHELLS
BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN ACADEMIA.
BUT THE AVERAGE JOE ON THE
STREET STILL SEARCHES, STILL
FEELS PAIN, AND HE FINDS MEANING
THROUGH JUST CHUGGING ON TO THE
NEXT CHUGGING OF THE BIG FLATS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THAT'S WHERE MEANING COMES
FROM-- KEEP TO KEEPING ON.
TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS.
>> SO SOME MEANING COMES FROM
BEER.
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN OUR
AGE AND ALL THE AGES BEFORE US
IS THERE IS AN AGREEMENT IN THE
CULTURE ABOUT WHAT THE RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS ARE THAT GROUND OUR
MEANING IN OUR LIVES.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW IF
THIS COMES IN YOUR BOOK, BUT
WHAT ABOUT THE JESUS?
>> HE IS THE MODEL OF
EXCELLENCE.
HE IS THE BE ALL/END ALL, THE
ALPHA/OMEGA.
>> Stephen:  IS JESUS ONE OF
YOUR GREAT WESTERN CLASSICS IN
HERE?
>> ABSOLUTE, WE TALK ABOUT
JESUS, ESPECIALLY BEGIN WITH THE
GOSPEL OF JOHN.
WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED THERE IS
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE WAY PEOPLE EXPERIENCED JESUS
AS A GOD ON THE ONE HAND, AND
THE WAY, SAY, BEFORE, THAT THE
GREEKS EXPERIENCED LOTS OF
DIFFERENT GOD AROUND.
>> Stephen:  THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE I WOULD SAY IS JESUS
IS ACTUALLY GOD.
AND THE OTHER ONE IS A FALSE
GOD.
>> WE ACTUALLY SORT OF THINK
THAT, TOO.
WE THINK THAT GEEZ ORS REALLY IS
A GOD.
HE'S DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS.
HIS WAY OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT
IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING WAS SO
RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM
EVERYTHING THAT CAME ALONG THAT
HE REALLY TRANSFORMED THE WORLD
AND SHOWED US A NEW POSSIBILITY.
>> Stephen:  I'M BIG WITH
JESUS BUT THE PART I DRAW THE
LINE AT IS SELF-SACRIFICE.
I THINK HE'S GREAT AND HE'S GOD
AND EVERYTHING HE DID IS-- BUT,
THAT LAST PART ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN
ME OR THAN I.
>> I SEE, YEAH.
>> Stephen:  OR HARVARD.
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT PART TO
STILL THINK JESUS WAS GREAT?
>> WELL, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE GONNA
GET IN JESUS' WORLD YOU DO?
JESUS' WORLD IS LOVE.
ONCE YOU'RE INSPIRED BY IT.
ONCE YOU'VE BREATHED IT IN, YOU
EXPERIENCE THE WHOLE WORLD--
>> Stephen:  ONCE YOU'VE
BREATHED IT IN.
ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE HUFF
JESUS?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> LITERALLY INSPIRE.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.
IT MEANS YOU BREATHE IN THE GOD.
YOU SAY WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND
MEANING IN SPORTING EVENTS.
THE SUPER BOWL IS THIS SUNDAY.
ARE YOU SAYING BEN
ROETHLISBERGER IS OUR GOD?
>> WELL, WE'RE HAVING A BIG
SUPER BOWL PARTY.
WHAT I THINK IS THAT THE WAY IN
WHICH YOU CAN FIND MEANING IN
BIG SPORTING EVENTS IS YOU CAN
EXPERIENCE FOR A MOMENT,
TOGETHER WITH OTHERS, WHEN A
GREAT EVENT OCCURS ON THE
BALLFIELD.
THE MOMENT WHERE YOU FIND
YOURSELF RISING AS ONE WITH ALL
THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE COUCH,
THAT MOMENT-- THAT-- AT THAT--
SORRY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  NO, NO, NO, YOU
PAINTED A PICTURE.
>> I HOPE TO.
YEAH, AT THAT POINT IT'S
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHAT'S
EXCELLENT AND SACRED BEFORE YOU.
AND WE THINK THERE ARE LOT OF
DIFFERENT PLACES IN A LIFE WHERE
YOU COULD GRAB ON TO MOMENTS
LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen:  SO FOOTBALL
BECOMES THE SACRED.
>> FOOTBALL BECOMES A VERSION OF
THE SACRED BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF
OTHERS, TOO.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S ONLY
EXAMPLE THAT RESONATES WITH ME.
WE TRADE AN ALL-KNOW,
ALL-LOVING, OMANISM TENT TEMP
ROLE GOD FOR FOURTH AND GOAL.
WHAT WE THINK IS THAT IS REALLY
ONE OF THE FEW THAT EVERYONE
AGREES IS LEFT IN THE CULTURE.
WE THINK IT'S A VERY MINOR ONE
ULTIMATELY.
BUT SINCE IT RESONATES WITH SO
MANY PEOPLE, YOU IF YOU COULD
GRAB ON TO THAT ONE YOU COULD
PULL YOURSELF UP.
>> Stephen:  IF THERE WAS ONE
WESTERN CLASSIC YOU WOULD
RECOMMEND SOMEBODY READ.
WHAT WOULD IT BE?
>> IT WOULD BE MELVILLE'S "MOBEY
DICK."
HE'S MAYBE THE GREATEST AMERICAN
AUTHOR--
>> Stephen:  EXCUSE ME.
YOU KNOW I WROTE A BOOK
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL WE HAVE
TIME FOR.
SEAN KELLY.
THE BOOK IS
