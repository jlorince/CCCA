>> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE.
AS YOU WERE, NATION.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS...
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" )
NOT BAD.
NOT BAD.
EVERYONE'S IN THE CHRISTMAS
SPIRIT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, THE MIDDLE EAST IS
ALWAYS A DANGEROUS PLACE, BUT I
AM TRULY SHOCKED BY THE RECENT
SERIES OF SHARK ATTACKS AT THE
EGYPTIAN RED SEA RESORT TOWN
SHARM EL-SHEIKH.
WHAT IS MOST SHOCKING ABOUT
THIS, THESE SHARKS MAY NOT BE
ACTING ALONE.
JIM.
>> EGYPT IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY THERE HAS BEEN A SURGE IN
SHARK ATTACKS IN THE RED SEA.
ONE CONSPIRACY THEORY BLAMES
NEIGHBORING ISRAEL'S MOSSAD SPY
AGENCY.
A REGIONAL GOVERNOR REMARKED,
"WHAT IS BEING SAID ABOUT THE
MOSSAD THROWING THE DEADLY SHARK
IN THE SEA TOO HIT TOURISM IN
EGYPT IS NOT OUT OF THE
QUESTION, BUT IT NEEDS TIME TO
CONFIRM."
>> Stephen: YES, BEFORE YOU
ACCUSE THE SHARKS OF WRONGDOING
IN THE SHARK ATTACK, I THINK
IT'S ONLY FAIR TO ASK, COULD BIT
THE JEWS?
NOW, FOLKS, ANYBODY WHO WATCHES
THIS SHOW KNOWS, THERE'S NO
GREATER FRIEND OF THE STATE OF
ISRAEL THAN YOURS TRULY.
I TRY NOT TO SPREAD
INTERNATIONAL ZIONIST
CONSPIRACIES, BUT ISRAEL WORKING
WITH SHARKS?
IT JUST MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE.
I MEAN, MAYBE THERE IS A GRAIN
OF TRUTH TO THE OLD STEREOTYPE,
THE JEWS CONTROL THE TIDE.
I MEAN, LOOK AT POSEIDON.
A LOT OF JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE BIG
BEARDS, AND, HEY, WHAT IS A
TRIDENT BUT A THREE-PRONGED,
UNDERWATER MENORAH.
AND LET'S FACE IT, LET'S FACE
IT, FOLKS, IT'S NOT LIKE JEWS
AND SHARKS HAVEN'T TEAMED UP IN
THE PAST.
LOOK HERE.
EVEN STEVEN SPIELBERG IS TELLING
THAT SHARK EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.
( APPLAUSE )
INCIDENTALLY, IN ITS EGYPTIAN
RELEASE, THAT MOVIE WAS CALLED
"JEWS."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
