NATION, IT SEEMS LIKE THE
BIGGEST NEWS STORIES ALWAYS HIT
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN, WHO COULD FORGET THE
CHRISTMAS BREAK WHEN JESUS WAS
BORN?
SURE ENOUGH OVER THANKSGIVING
THERE WAS A SUZIE.
JIM.
>> WIKILEAKS STRIKES AGAIN.
ANOTHER DOCUMENT DUMP FROM THE
WEB SITE.
>> A NEW MASSIVE DOCUMENT DUMP.
>> ANOTHER WHOPPING DOCUMENT
DUMP.
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE MASSIVE
DUMP.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NOT
SURPRISING.
AFTER THANKSGIVING YOU SHOULD
ALWAYS EXPECT A PRETTY BIG DUMP.
( LAUGHTER )
PEABODY.
PEABODY AWARD.
ONCE AGAIN THE DUMP CAME FROM
WIKILEAKS, LED BY ENEMY OF THE
STATE AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW
JULIAN ASSANGE, MAN RELENTLESSLY
COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY
PROBABLY BECAUSE HIS SKIN IS
SEE-THROUGH.
( LAUGHTER )
THIS TIME ASSANGE TOOK A
WIKILEAK ALL OVER THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, RELEASING A QUARTER
OF A MILLION CONFIDENTIAL
DIPLOMATIC CABLES REVEALING
SENSITIVE COMMUNICATIONS LIKE A
U.S. DIPLOMAT CALLING ITALIAN
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI
FECKLESS, VAIN AND INEFFECTIVE
AND ANOTHER CALLING FRENCH
PRESIDENT SARKOZY THIN-SKINNED.
WHICH I'M SURE WILL UPSET HIM.
( LAUGHTER )
I'VE HEARD HE'S PRETTY
THIN-SKINNED.
BUT THAT'S MOTT THE MOST
EMBARRASSING PART.
JIM.
>> ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASSING
REVELATIONS MAY INVOLVE THE U.S.
STATE DEPARTMENT.
CABLES THAT REPORTEDLY SHOW
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY
CLINTON ORDERED U.S. EMBASSIES
AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES TO
GATHER PRIVATE INFORMATION ON
U.N. LEADERS AND DIPLOMATS,
INCLUDING COMPUTER PASSWORDS,
EVEN D.N.A.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
SECRETARY CLINTON WAS COLLECTING
D.N.A.
I ASSUME TO FIND OUT WHICH
AMBASSADORS BILL HAD NOT HAD SEX
WITH.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, I'M GOING TO SHOCK YOU
FOLKS RIGHT NOW AND DEFEND
ASSANGE ON THIS ONE.
I SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME DIPLOMACY
GOT TAKEN DOWN A PEG.
LET'S FACE IT, DIPLOMATS ARE
JUST A BUNCH OF ANTI-WAR
TALK-MONGERS WORD-MINCING THEIR
WAY AROUND COCKTAIL PARTY,
DANCING AROUND THE TRUTH TO FIND
COMMON GROUND BETWEEN HOSTILE
NATIONS ALL THE WHILE LAUGHING
BEHIND OUR BACKS ABOUT HOW THEIR
LICENSE PLATES ALLOW THEM TO
PARK THEIR PEUGEOTS IN HANDICAP
LOADING ZONES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I ADMIRE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.
THAT'S WHAT I AM.
CASE IN POINT, THANKSGIVING
DINNER LAST THURSDAY.
I WALKED RIGHT INTO MY BROTHER'S
DINING ROOM AND TOLD UNCLE BERT
WE ALL KNOW HE'S GAY AND AUNT
SOPHIE HER STUFFING IS A WAR
CRIME.
WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS BUSY
SCREAMING AND CRYING, I GOT ALL
THE CRISPY TURKEY SKIN.
THAT'S ALL WIKILEAKS IS DOING
HERE ON A GLOBAL SCALE BECAUSE
AFTER THESE REVELATION, NO ONE
WILL EVER TRUST AMERICA'S
DIPLOMACY AGAIN, AND COUNTRIES
CAN GO BACK TO A MORE DIRECT
MEANS OF COMMUNICATION -- WAR.
I AM SURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MR. ASSANGE INTENDED.
HERE TO JOIN ME IN CELEBRATING
THE DEATH OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY,
PLEASE WELCOME THE FORMER
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE IN
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION,
JAMES RUBIN.
JAMES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, THERE'S A LOT OF BROUHAHA
ABOUT THE DOCUMENT DUMP.
PEOPLE OUT IN THE DIPLOMACY
WORLD, THEY'RE PRETTY UPSET,
CORRECT IN
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK THE ITALIAN FOREIGN
MINISTER CALLED IT THE 9/11 OF
DIPLOMACY.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?
>> WELL, THE WORST THAT COULD
HAPPEN, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, AT
THE PRESENT TIME DEPARTMENT
DIPLOMATS, ALL THEY REALLY HAVE
IS THE TRUSTING THEY BUILD WITH
FOREIGN LEADERS.
IF THEY LOSE THAT BECAUSE
FOREIGN LEADERS THINK THE
MATERIAL THEY'RE SHARING OR THE
CONVERSATIONS THEY'RE HAVING ARE
GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT PAGES
'RE LESSOF THE NEWSPAPER, áq
LIKELY TO BE FRANK.
>> Stephen: BUT, AND PARDON MY
FRENCH FOR A SECOND, DOESN'T
EVERYBODY KIND OF KNOW THE
THINGS DIPLOMATS SAY IS
[BLEEPED]?
IT'S JUST BENEVOLENT [BLEEPED].
IT'S [BLEEPED] FOR A GOOD
REASON, TO STOP A WAR, RIGHT?
THIS IS JUST PEELING BACK THE
MASK AND SAY, WE ALL KNOW WE
TALK ABOUT THIS WAY ABOUT EACH
OTHER, CORRECT?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY NOT.
IN GENERAL DIPLOMATS HAVE TO
RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY RESOLVING AN
ISSUE PRIVATELY, AND THAT MIGHT
INCLUDE ALLOWING A LEADER TO SAY
SOMETHING PUBLICLY THAT IS
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SAY
PRIVATELY.
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO ALLOW A
HYPOCRISY IN AN ARAB COUNTRY,
BUT IF IT'S GOING TO GET THE JOB
DONE, LIKE IN THE CASE OF YEMEN,
AND YOU'LL PROBABLY AGREE WITH
THIS ONE.
>> Stephen: DON'T COUNT ON IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE
MILITARY FORCE AGAINST AN AL
QAEDA CELL IN YEMEN, AND THE
YEMENI GOVERNMENT SAYS WE CAN'T
TELL OUR PEOPLE THAT YOU DO IT,
THE UNITED STATES, WE'RE GOING
TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, SO
WE MAY NEED TO HAVE THATÑi
CONVERSATION PRIVATELY.
IF WIKILEAKS IS GOING TO PUT IT
ALL OVER THE WORLD, MAYBE NEXT
TIME THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT WON'T
BE SO WILLING TO LET US TAKE OUT
THE TERRORISTS INSIDE YEMEN.
>> Stephen: WELL, HOW ARE THEY
GOING TO STOP US?
IF WE LOSE DIPLOMACY ALTOGETHER,
DON'T WE JUST GO BACK TO WAR,
WAR, WAR, WAR, WAR.
ISN'T THAT WHAT DIPLOMATS ARE?
THEY'RE BUMPERS BETWEEN THE TWO
WOATS OF WAR.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY SOMETIMES...
IT'S A LITTLE... IT'S A LITTLE
COMPLICATED, BUT SOMETIMES
DIPLOMACY AND FORCE GO VERY WELL
TOGETHER.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE BUILDING A
COALITION OF COUNTRIES TO HELP
YOUçó USE MILITARY FORCE.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH
AFGHANISTAN IN THE BUILDUP TO
THE WAR THERE, WE WENT AROUND
THE WORLD.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY
OF STATE COLIN POWELL AND GOT
OTHER COUNTRIES TO AGREE WITH US
TO USE FORCE.
PALAO, RIGHT?
COALITION OF THE WILLING?
>> SOMETIMES DIPLOMACY AND FORCE
GO TOGETHER REALLY WELL.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME, JAMES RUBIN,
FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
STATE UNDER THE CLINTO
