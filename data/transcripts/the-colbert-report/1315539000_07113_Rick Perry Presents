>> ABSOLUTELY, AND IT WOULD HELP
THE POOR
>> Stephen: YES, ELIMINATING THE
MINIMUM WAGE WOULD HELP THE
POOR.
FOR ONE THING, THEY'D STOP
ENVYING PEOPLE WITH JOBS.
BUT FOLKS, AS IMPRESSIVE AS THE
FIELD WAS, of course, THERE CAN
BE ONLY ONE.
AND THE CLEAR WINNER LAST NIGHT
WAS MY MAN RICK PARRY -- WITH AN
A.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS GUY IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.
AND NOT JUST WHEN HE'S JOGGING.
FIRST OFF, PARRY TOOK AIM AT THE
SO-CALLED SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS
AROUND GLOBAL WARMING.
>> JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GROUP
OF SCIENTISTS THAT HAVE STOOD UP
AND SAID HERE IS THE FACT,
GALILEO GOT OUTVOTED FOR A
SPELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: YEAH.
GALILEO BELIEVED THE EARTH
REVOLVED AROUND THE SUN, BUT
RESPECTED SCIENTISTS LIKE tHE
POPE AND HIS INQUISITORS
CHALLENGED THAT WITH THEIR
THEORY THAT HOT IRONS WOULD BURN
OUT HIS EYES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND PERRY IS SUCH A BADASS THAT
HIS BIGGEST APPLAUSE LINE OF THE
NIGHT DIDN'T EVEN COME FROM
SOMETHING HE SAID.
BRIAN WILLIAMS, LET'S MAKE SOME
PEOPLE SMILE.
>> GOVERNOR PERRY, A QUESTION
ABOUT TEXAS.
YOUR STATE HAS EXECUTED 234
DEATH ROW INMATES, MORE THAN ANY
OTHER GOVERNOR IN MODERN TIMES.
HAVE YOU--
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WOOOO!!!!!
WOOOO!
WAAAA!
LETHAL COCKTAIL ALL OVER MY
DESK.
I SAY WE BARBECUE THEM SONS OF
BITCHES LIKE TEXAS TOAST!!
THIS IS GREAT MOMENT FOR PERRY.
BUT LET'S FACE IT, MENTIONING
EXECUTIONS IS A SUREFIRE
APPLAUSE LINE FOR CONSERVATIVES.
IT'S LIKE SAYING "POT" TO THE
AUDIENCE OF "THE DAILY SHOW."
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU PEOPLE, TOO, EVIDENTLY.
BUT THE THING THAT REALLY SEALED
MY MAN'S VICTORY WAS WHEN HE WAS
THE ONLY ONE TO MAN UP AND TAKE
ON THE 800-POUND GORILLA IN THE
ROOM, BEING STOMPED ON BY THE
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, BEING
RIDDEN BY THE EMPEROR WHO HAS NO
CLOTHES:  SOCIAL SECURITY.
HE PULLED NO PUNCHES WHEN IT
CAME TO THIS UNIVERSALLY
BELOVED, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE CANCER
ON OUR SOCIETY.
JIM?
>> IT IS A PONZI SCHEME TO TELL
OUR KIDS THAT ARE 25 OR 30 YEARS
OLD TODAY, YOU'RE PAYING INTO A
PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO BE
THERE.
YOU CANNOT KEEP THE STATUS QUO
IN PLACE AND NOT CALL IT
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PONZI
SCHEME.
IT IS.
THAT IS WHAT IT IS
>> Stephen: YES, SOCIAL SECURITY
IS A CLASSIC PONZI SCHEME!
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET BACK
THE MONEY YOU PUT IN.
BUT YOUR MONEY GOES TO SOMEONE
WHO GOT IN EARLIER.
THINK ABOUT IT: MILLIONS OF
UNSUSPECTING YOUNG RUBES ARE
PAYING IN, WHILE THE FAT CATS AT
THE TOP SIT BACK AND RAKE IN AN
AVERAGE OF $1,177 A MONTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL TO FUND THEIR LAVISH
LIFESTYLES OF MOTORIZED CHAIRS
AND SPECIAL TEETH THEY CAN TAKE
OUT AT NIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS A SCANDAL.
IT HAS TO END!
RICK PERRY KNOWS THAT ANY TIME A
GROUP OF PEOPLE POOL THEIR MONEY
FOR ANY REASON, IT'S A PONZI
SCHEME.
AND IT'S NOT JUST SOCIAL
SECURITY--  SAME GOES FOR BANKS.
TELL YOU WHAT --
YOU DEPOSIT A TEN DOLLAR BILL
THEN COME BACK TO TAKE IT OUT,
THEY DON'T GIVE YOU BACK THE
SAME BILL!
ONE TIME THEY TRIED TO GIVE ME
TWO FIVES!
[ LAUGHTER ]
DO THEY THINK I'M AN IDIOT?!
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF SENIORS OUT THERE ARE SO BENT
ON WANTING TO PUT THEIR MONEY
INTO A PROGRAM AND GET OTHER
PEOPLE'S MONEY OUT,
OUT, THERE'S ALREADY A PRIVATE
ALTERNATIVE.
IT'S CALLED VEGAS.
OLD PEOPLE ALREADY LOVE IT.
WE JUST PLUNK THEM DOWN AT THE
SLOTS AND LET THEM FEED THEIR
LIFE SAVINGS IN ONE NICKEL AT A
TIME.
ALL THEY NEED IS TWO PLUMS AND A
CHERRY AND THEY'VE GOT
THEMSELVES ANOTHER WEEK OF BLOOD
PRESSURE MEDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THERE'S NO TELLING -- FOLKS,
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG
WE'LL EXTEND THEIR LIVES -- IN
THAT CASINOS HAVE NO WINDOWS OR
CLOCKS.
AND FOR THE VERY FEW WHO DON'T
HIT THE RETIREMENT JACKPOT,
THERE'S A SOCIAL SAFETY NET.
WE COMP THEIR PRIME RIB BUFFET
AND SHOVE THEM INTO THE DESERT.
THEY'LL THINK THEY'RE AT THE NEW
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW: RICK
PERRY PRESENTS "VULTURE."
WE'L
