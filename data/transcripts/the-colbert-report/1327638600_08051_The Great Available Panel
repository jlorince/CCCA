>> YES, WE DO.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO

>> Stephen: THAT'S ALL
RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT REIMBURSED FOR
TIPS, OKAY.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, PANEL, WHAT IS
GOING ON WITH THIS ELECTION?
OKAY, JOHN HARWOOD, OKAY,
YOU'RE A POLITICAL ANALYST,
WHO TAKES FLORIDA?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I'M
IN AN OPEN MARRIAGE WITH MY
POLITICAL PREDICTIONS RIGHT
NOW.
BUT-- .
>> Stephen: GOOD MAN, GOOD
MAN, THAT'S APPEALING,
EVIDENTLY.
>> OKAY.
BUT I THINK THE ONE THAT I
LOVE THE BEST AT THE MOMENT
IS THAT MITT ROMNEY COMES
BACK, WINS FLORIDA, WINS THE
NOMINATION.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES MITT
ROMNEY TAKE IT BACK THOUGH.
PEOPLE ARE LIKING GINGRICH
RIGHT NOW.
WOULD IT HELP IF MITT ROMNEY
CHEATED ON ONE OF HIS WIVES?
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING,
KATRINA, YOU SAW WHAT
DR. KEITH ABLO SAID, THE
LADIES TRUST A GUY WHO IS A
KNOWN PHILANDERER.
NEWT GINGRICH, WHAT'S THE
MAGIC.
YOU ARE A LADY.
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS
BEEN SCREWING THIS COUNTRY
FOR TOO LONG.
IT'S NOT JUST NEWT GINGRICH.
>> Stephen: EXCUSE ME.
>> IT'S BASICALLY SCREW AND
SHAFT.
AND I THINK TONIGHT WE'RE
GOING TO SEE A GUY.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU SAY,
A SCREW AND A SHAFT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: A SCREW AND A
SHAFT SO DOUBLE TEAMING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> WELL NO, BUT I MEAN-- I
MEAN NEWT-- IT'S NOT JUST
NEWT GINGRICH BUT HE'S GOING
TO GET OUT THERE TONIGHT.
HE'S A STREET FIGHTER WITH A
POISONOUS HISTORY, RACE
BATHER, BAITS THE MYTHIC
LIBERAL MEDIA AND THIS IS A
GUY WHO WILL GO AS LOW AS HE
CAN TO RILE UP THE BASE,
HE'S PLAYING THE OLD
REPUBLICAN SOUTHERN
STRATEGY.
LET'S PLAY ON RACIAL ANXIETY
AND FEAR.
HE HAS NO SCRUPLES.
>> Stephen: HE IS A FIGHTER,
HE IS A FIGHTER.
>> AND, AND --
>> AND ARE YOU STILL
ATTRACTED TO HIM.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT, WHAT
IS IT-- WHAT IS IT THAT
MAKES SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN
MARRIED THREE TIMES
ATTRACTIVE TO THE LADIES.
DAVID CASSIDY, YOU'VE BEEN
MARRIED THREE TIMES.
>> YES, I HAVE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU LAND
THE SECOND TWO.
WHAT'S THE MAGIC.
>> MONEY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK
THAT JUST MONEY ALONE CAN
PUSH NEWT THROUGH?
COULD HE DRAG IT OUT OR CAN
HE WIN IT.
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY.
MITT ROMNEY HAS GOT A HECK
OF A LOT MORE MONEY THAN
GINGRICH DOES BETWEEN HIS
CAMPAIGN AND SUPERPAC.
>> Stephen: IS NEWT
DECLARING WAR ON SUCCESS.
BECAUSE NEWT HAS ATTACKED
REALLYNY FOR BAIN CAPITAL.
DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT ROMNEY
HAS MADE AND ITS AMOUNT HE'S
KEPT?
DAVID I WILL GO TO YOU.
>> WELL, I'M A CAPITALIST.
>> RIGHT.
>> I'M GLAD I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE THAT KIND OF
CAPITALIST WHEN I USED TO
KISS YOUR POSTER ON MY WALL.
I MEAN THERE ARE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF CAPITALISTS.
>> Stephen: DAVID, DAVID,
DAVID-- DAVID, HEADS UP.
>> YOU'VE GOT THE TALKING
BALL.
AND HERE IT IS.
>> I BELIEVE-- .
>> Stephen: I'M OVER HERE,
DAVID.
>> I BELIEVE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SO MUCH SHOW BUSINESS IN
MY LIFE, APOLOGIZE.
I BELIEVE HONESTLY THAT BOTH
OF THEM ARE THE MOST
EMBARRASSING, SAD, PATHETIC,
REALLY?
THIS IS THE BEST WE CAN DO?
>> Stephen: OKAY, BEST PIE.
>> APPLE.
>> Stephen: WRONG.
>> AMERICAN PIE.
>> Stephen: CLOSE.
>> .
>> Stephen: IS THAT TOO MUCH
OF A HARDBALL QUESTION FOR
YOU.
DID I THROW YOU WITH THAT
ONE, DAVID.
>> I'M LOST.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
IN-- CONNECTICUT.
>> BY THE WAY THE ANSWER IS
BLUEBERRY.
OKAY.
IN CONNECTICUT THIS PAST
WEEK FOUR POLICE OFFICERS
ARE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
HISPANIC MEMBERS OF THE
COMMUNITY.
WHEN THE MAYOR WAS ASKED
ABOUT THIS DISCRIMINATION
THIS IS THE RESPONSE HE GAVE
TO A LOCAL REPORTER, JIM,
CAN YOU ROLL THIS.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR
THE LATINO COMMUNITY TODAY?
>> I MIGHT HAVE TACOES WHEN
GI HOME, I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR
SURE YET.
>> Stephen: OKAY, HE'S
GETTING HEAT, THIS GUY IS
GETTING HEAT FOR SAYING HE
IS GOING HAVE TACOES.
>> HE SHOULD GET HEAT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, WHY, IS IT
SO PC NOW THAT YOU CAN'T
HAVE TACOES?
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
>> YOU CAN HAVE TACOES.
YOU JUST CAN'T SAY REPULSIVE
THING ABOUT LATINOS WHEN YOU
ARE TALKING ABOUT TACOES.
>> Stephen: HE DIDN'T.
HE SAID TACOES.
>> THAT IS-- .
>> Stephen: IS SAY IF HE
SAID I WOULD NOT EAT A TACO
BECAUSE IT IS A FILTHY
CUISINE.
>> BUT THE MESSAGE-- .
>> Stephen: THAT WAB.
>> BUT THE --
>> HE'S AN IDIOT.
>> THE MEASURE OF WHAT WE
SAW IN HIS RESPONSE WHICH
WAS OBSCENE IS A MEASURE OF
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT CITY.
WHERE LATINOS WERE BEATEN,
HARASSED.
THAT'S WHAT-- YOU KNOW THAT
IS THE KIND OF MENTALITY,
THE ATTITUDE.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES EATING
A TACO HURT THAT.
>> YOU DON'T SAY THAT KIND
OF THING.
AFTER YOU-- .
>> Stephen: THAT IS THE PC
POLICE.
THE THOUGHT POLICE, IT IS
THE FOOD POLICE.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THE
CONSTITUENTS THERE IN HIS
LITTLE TOWN ARE GOING TO SAY,
VIA CON DIOS TO MY MAYOR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LISTEN JOHN,
KATRINA, DAVID, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
EVERYBODY GIVE IT UP FOR THE
VERY FIRST GREAT AVAILABLE
