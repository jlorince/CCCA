THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN, I CAN'T ASK FOR
ANY MORE THAN THAT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
IN THERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUNDTHE WORLD.
I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GREATTHANKSGIVING.
I SURE DID.
STILL WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THELEFTOVERS, OF COURSE.
THIS MORNING I USED GRAVY AS AMOISTURIZER.
(LAUGHTER)HAD TO, REALLY, MY SKIN WAS
DRIED OUT AFTER SHAVING WITHTHOSE MASHED POTATOES.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, THANKSGIVING AS
ALWAYS REMINDED ME OF WHAT I'MMOST GRATEFUL FOR-- THAT POOR
PEOPLE STILL CAN'T GET HEALTHINSURANCE.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE THE OBAMACARE WEB SITE
REMAINS A DISASTER.
EVEN THOUGH NOW THEADMINISTRATION'S WEB SITE GURUS
ARE BRAGGING THAThealthcare.gov IS WORKING MORE
THAN 90% OF THE TIME.
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FORGOVERNMENT WORK.
GET ON THE SCHOOL BUS, KIDS!
PRINCIPAL OBAMA SAYS THE BRIDGEIS 0% COMPLETE.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, I CAN SEE WHY THE
ADMINISTRATION HADN'T GOT THEHEALTH CARE WEB SITE UP TO SPEED
YET-- BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY HAVEOTHER PRIORITIES.
>> EVERY THANKS GIVING THEPRESIDENT CHOOSES ONE TURKEY TO
PARDON.
>> WELL, TONIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMAIS LETTING YOU INFLUENCE THE
DECISION BY VOTING ON LINE.
>> UNCLE SAM NEEDS YOU TO VOTE.
SO DO THESE TURKEYS, CARAMEL ANDPOPCORN, THE FINALIST FOR
NATIONAL THANKSGIVING TURKEYS.
ONLY ONE BIRD CAN HOLD THETITLE.
YOU CAN VOTE ONLINE.
STAY TUNED TO SEE WHO WINS.
>> Stephen: OH, I UNDERSTANDWHY healthcare.gov IS SCREWED:
OBAMA NEEDED HIS A-TEAM TO WORKON TURKEYCARE . GOBBLE.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU SEE, THE PRESIDENTIAL TURKEYPARDON THIS YEAR WAS DECIDED BY
AN ONLINE VOTE.
IT'S LIKE "HOT OR NOT" WHERE HOTIS DEFINED AS 375 DEGREES FOR
THREE HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT A WASTE OF AMERICA'S TIME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
BECAUSE ANY FOOL CAN SEE THATPOPCORN IS THE BETTER TURKEY!
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THE ACTUALSTATS THEY PROVIDE RIGHT ON THE
WEB SITE.
POPCORN IS A LEAN AND SEXY 37POUNDS WHILE CARAMEL IS A
LUMBERING TUBBO AT 38 POUNDS.
HEY, FATSO, DID YOU ALREADY EATTHE CHICKEN AND THE DUCK?
WHY WOULD ANYBODY VOTE FORCARAMEL WHO LISTENS TO LADY GAGA
WHEN POPCORN JAMS OUT TOBEYONCE.
COME ON, CARAMEL.
LADY GAGA ISN'T YOUR FRIEND.
SHE'S ALREADY DRESSED UP ASTHREE OF THE FOUR MAJOR FOOD
GROUPS.
WHEREAS BEYONCE SANG "I DON'TTHINK YOU'RE READY FOR THIS
JELLY" WHICH IS CLEARLY A SONGABOUT HOW POPCORN IS NOT READY
TO BE SERVED WITH CRANBERRYSAUCE.
(LAUGHTER)LONG STORY SHORT, CARAMEL IS A
LOSER AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLEAGREE WITH ME.
>> AN ANNUAL THANKSGIVINGTRADITION PRESIDENT OBAMA
PARDONING THIS YEAR'S TURKEY,POPCORN IS THE NAME OF THE
TURKEY, RECEIVING THEPRESIDENTIAL PARDON.
POPCORN BEAT A TURKEY NAMEDCARAMEL FOR THE HONOR.
>> Stephen: BOOM!
SUCK IT, CARAMEL!
THE INTERNET HAS SPOKEN AND THEYDECIDED YOU LOSE.
AND SINCE IT'S THE INTERNET,THEY'VE ALSO DECIDED THAT YOU'RE
GAY!
RON PAUL 2012.
(LAUGHTER)NOT SURE WHICH OF THOSE TWO
YOU'RE APPLAUDING FOR BUT THANKYOU.
BUT NATION THERE'S A DARK SIDETO THIS STORY OF TWO CAGED
ANIMAL KOS PETEING TO NOT-DIE.
NEITHER OF THEM DIE.
>> HOWEVER, WHEN THE ONLINEVOTING ENDED EVEN THOUGH IT
LOOKED LIKE THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION WAS GOING TO TAKE
A STAND AND CARAMEL WAS GOING TOGET EXECUTED THE WHITE HOUSE
TWEETED, IN FACT, NO, NO, NO,THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO LIVE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT!
OUR COWARD IN CHIEF WASN'TSATISFIED PULLING OUT OF IRAQ
AND PULLING OUT OF AFGHANISTAN.
NOW HE'S PULLING OUT OF TURKEY.
(LAUGHTER)MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT KIND OF
MESSAGE DOES THIS SEND THE KIDS?
WHAT DO PARENTS SAY WHEN THEIRCHILD LOOKS UP WITH THOSE BIG
WET EYES AND ASK: "MOMMY, WHY DOTHINGS HAVE TO NOT DIE?"
THIS IS THE WEAKENING OF OURDEMOCRACY!
ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES,SIR!
NEXT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL METHAT THE LOSING MISS AMERICA
CONTESTANTS GET TO LIVE!
(LAUGHTER)WELL, NATION, I FOR ONE AM NOT
GOING TO STAND FOR IT.
THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING.
ALSO WHY I'VE STARTED A PETITIONAT colbertnation.com CALLING
ON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO LIVE UP TOTHE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE AND
EXECUTE CARAMEL THE TURKEY.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)OKAY?
SO HEAD TO colbertnation.comAND SIGN MY PETITION.
BY THE WHITE HOUSE'S OWN RULES,IF WE GET 100,000 RESPONSES IN
30 DAYS THEY HAVE TO RESPOND.
SOON OBAMA COULD BE GIVING THATLOSER CARAMEL WHAT HE'S GOT
COMING TO HIM.
HOPEFULLY LETTING POPCORN
