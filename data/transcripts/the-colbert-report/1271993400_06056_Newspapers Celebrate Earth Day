WOULDN'T BE PAID.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, HAPPY EARTH DAY,
EVERYBODY!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I'M AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.
I CELEBRATE EARTH DAY BECAUSE IT'S AMERICA'S PLANET.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, EVERY APRIL 22nd THE MEDIA TRIES TO BRAINWASH US WITH THEIR ANTI-MERCURY IN THE
DRINKING WATER BIAS, BUT THIS YEAR I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
TO SEE HOW THE "USA TODAY" WAS CELEBRATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS, BY PRINTING A
SPECIAL EARTH DAY BONUS PULLOUT.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
SUCK IT, TREES.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
BEST OF ALL, YOU SEE FROM DOWN HERE, BACK THERE, IT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT 40% PAINT ADS.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
THAT'S ALSO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE OCEAN THAT IS EMPTY PAINT CANS.
OF COURSE, THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAS GOT ONE, TOO, A LITTLE PULLOUT CELEBRATING NUCLEAR
POWER, BUT MY FAVORITE HAS GOT TO BE "THE NEW YORK POST"'S
INSERT, WHICH IS A STRIP OF OLD TIRE AND A MATCH.
[LAUGHTER]
VERY CUMBERSOME.
THAT IS A CUMBERSOME... THAT IS A CUMBERSOME INSERT.
I'M NOT SURPRISED THESE GUYS HAVE A SPECIAL KINSHIP WITH THE GLOBAL WARMING CROWD, FOLKS,
BECAUSE NEWSPAPERS ARE THE ONLY THINGS DISAPPEARING FASTER||||
