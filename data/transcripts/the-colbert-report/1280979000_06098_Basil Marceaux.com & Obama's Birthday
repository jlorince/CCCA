TRUTH-TELLING HERE, FOLKS.
BEFORE I GET STARTED, I JUST
WANT TO REMIND ALL OF MY VIEWERS
IN TENNESSEE THAT YOUR PRIMARIES
ARE HELD TOMORROW, AND IT'S YOUR
CHANCE TO VOTE FOR THE MAN I
BELIEVE IS THE FUTURE OF
AMERICAN POLITICS, BASIL
MARCEAUX DOT COM.
BUT WHY TAKE MY WORD FOR IT WHEN
YOU CAN TAKE HIS, LET'S SAY
WORDS FOR IT.
>> HELLO, CITIZENS, THIS IS
BASIL MARCEAUX DOT COM.
I WANT YOU TO PUT ME IN THIS
BUILDING, THE CAPITOL BEHIND ME
HERE, SO I CAN DO MY ISSUES AND
MAKE YOU ALL MORE FREE-ER THAN
YOU WERE YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen: YES, MORE FREE-ER,
BECAUSE FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER
WORD FOR NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE,
AND NOBODY HAS LESS TO LOSE THAN
BASIL MARCEAUX DOT COM.
SO WHETHER YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, A
REPUBLICAN OR AN INDEPENDENT,
YOU GET OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE
FOR BASIL MARCEAUX DOT COM, AND
LET HIM DO HIS ISSUES ALL OVER
TENNESSEE.
[APPLAUSE]
NOW, SPEAKING... HE'S THE MAN.
SPEAKING OF LEGENDARY ORATORS,
BARACK OBAMA, TODAY IS THE
PRESIDENT'S 49th BIRTHDAY.
AND, OF COURSE, DEMOCRATS ARE
USING IT TO DRUM UP SUPPORT BY
HOLDING BIRTHDAY EVENTS AROUND
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING A
PRESIDENTIAL POTLUCK IN PHOENIX,
49 CANDLES FOR AMERICA PARTY IN
DES MOINES, AND A HAWAIIAN LUAU
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.
AND HONOLULU, I ASSUME, WILL
RECIPROCATE BY HOLDING A DOLPHIN
RODEO.
WELL, FOIX, I REFUSE TO
CELEBRATE, BECAUSE I AM PART OF
THE HAPPY BIRTHER MOVEMENT.
UNTIL I SEE A VALID BIRTH
CERTIFICATE, I SAY THERE IS NO
DAY HE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.
THAT HOLDS TRUE FOR ALL
PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING GEORGE
WASHINGTON.
DID YOU KNOW HE ISN'T EVEN FROM
AMERICA?
[LAUGHTER]
EVIDENTLY HE WAS BORN IN SOME
BRITISH COLONY.
SO I'M SORRY, NO CAKES, NO
BALLOON, NO ICE CREAM UNTIL
OBAMA RELEASES FULL
DOCUMENTATION THAT PROVES HE'S A
JOLLY GOOD FELLOW.
I MEAN, DOCUMENTATION THAT
NOBODY CAN DENY, THAT NOBODY CAN
DEN
