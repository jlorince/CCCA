NATION, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, THE ESTABLISHMENT MAY
HAVE THWARTED MY CAMPAIGN
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
BUT THERE IS ONE MOMENT THEY
CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY.
LAST FRIDAY'S ROCK YOU LIKE
A HERMAN CAIN
SOUTH-CAIN-OLINA AT THE
COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON.
IT GAVE ME SOME OF HOPE TO
SEE SO MANY STUDENTS SO
WILLING TO SKIP CLASS ON
SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
(LAUGHTER)
THOUGH THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER,
DON'T LET IT BE FORGOT THAT
ONCE THERE WAS A SPOT FOR
ONE BRIEF SHINING MOMENT
THAT WAS KNOWN AS CAINELOT.
JIMMY?
>> STEPHEN COLBERT IS HAVING
A RALLY TODAY IN SOUTH
CAROLINA.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT ROLL MOOD
SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> HERMAN CAIN AN STEPHEN
COLBERT ARE TAKING SOUTH
CAROLINA BY STORM.

CAIN SOUTH CAIN-OLINA
PRIMARY RALLY.
>> GIVE IT UP TORE THE MAN,
MR. HERMAN CAIN!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT FOLKS, I AM
NOT HERE TO PANDER.
BECAUSE I KNOW I DON'T NEED
TO PANDER TO THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: CAN I GET AN
AMEN.
>> AMEN!
>> Stephen: YOU'RE GOOD.
BEFORE I INTRODUCE THE MAN
WE'VE ALL GATHERED HERE TO
SEE INTRODUCE ME, I WANT TO
SOLICIT THE OTHER CANDIDATES
IN THE RACIVE.
THINK PEOPLE ARE HUNGERING
FOR A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN.
SO I'M TO THE GOING TO GO
AFTER THIS MAN'S OPPONENTS.
I WON'T BE SAYING THINGS
LIKE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MITT ROMNEY AND A
STATUE OF MITT ROMNEY IS
THAT THE STATUE NEVER
CHANGES ITS POSITION.
AND IT WILL BE WRONG TO SAY
THAT IF YOU GUESS RON PAUL'S
REAL NAME HE HAS TO TEACH
YOU HOW TO SPIN STRAW INTO
GOLD.
NOT GOING TO DO IT.
AND I AM NOT GOING TO ANSWER
THE GOTCHA QUESTION AM I
INTERESTED IN AN OPEN
MARRIAGE.
THOUGH I AM FLATTERED THAT
NEWT GINGRICH ASKED ME.
SO IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO
INTRODUCE TO YOU THE HERMAN
WITH THE PLAN, THE PLAN SO
FINE THEY NAMED IT 9, 9, 9,
THE MAN OF THE FLAT TAX, THE
INDIANA JONES OF OPPORTUNITY
ZONE, THE HERMAN, THE
HER-MYTH, MR. HERMAN CAIN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MR. COLBERT.
AND I WILL ALSO LIKE TO
THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
>> I KNOW HE IS A POKEMON
WORD.
I BELIEVE THE WORDS GO LIKE
THIS.
I DIDN'T SAY I WAS GOING TO
SAY IT.
TO BE ALL THESE THING, NOT
BECAUSE I TOLD YOU ♪
♪ TO ♪
♪ BUT BELIEVE IN YOURSELF ♪
♪ AMERICA ♪
♪ MY BROTHA FROM ANOTHER
MOTHER MR. STEPHEN COLBERT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT MAN HAS GOT
A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.
ALL I CAN ADD TO HERMAN'S
ELOQUENT QUOTATION FROM
POKEMON IS GOT TO CATCH THEM
ALL.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, A LOT
OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHY
ARE WE HERE?
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
IN FACT HERMAN CANNED ME
THAT ON THE BUS COMING HERE
JUST NOW.
THE PUNDITS HAVE ASKED IS
THIS ALL SOME JOKE?
WE'VE ALL HEARD IT, HAVEN'T
WE?
I SAY IF THEY ARE CALLING,
BEING ALLOWED TO FORM A
SUPERPAC AND COLLECTING
UNLIMITED AND UNTRACEABLE
AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM
INDIVIDUAL UNIONS AND
CORPORATIONS AND SEND THAT
MONEY ON -- SPEND THAT MONEY
ON POLITICAL ADS AND FOR
PERSONAL ENRICHMENT AND
SURRENDER THAT SUPERPAC TO
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS
WHILE I EXPLORE A RUN FOR
OFFICE, IF THAT IS A JOKE,
THEN THEY ARE SAYING OUR
ENTIRE CAMPAIGN FINANCE
SYSTEM IS A JOKE.
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT-- OFFENDED BY THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE FOUGHT A GREAT CIVIL WAR
TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE
ARE PEOPLE.
AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID AT
GETTISBURG, GIVE ME SOME
MONEY.
THE EXPERTS SAY HE CAN'T
WIN.
THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG BEFORE.
NOT THIS TIME.
THIS TIME WAS SPOT ON.
BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU LOSE,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU
SURRENDER.
WE HERE MUST HIGHLY RESOLVE
THAT THESE UNLIMITED FUNDS
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONATED
IN VEIN.
BECAUSE IF CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH A
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO
INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS,
THEN I PROMISE YOU
GOVERNMENT OF THOSE PEOPLE,
BY THOSE PEOPLE, AND FOR
THOSE PEOPLE SHALL NOT
PERISH FROM THIS EARTH.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> AND GOD BLESS HERMAN
CAIN.
GET UP HERE HERMAN.
COME ON.
