BEING A HIGH SCHOOL ALL AMERICAN BASKETBALL PLAYER IN THE D.C.

AFRICAN AMERICAN ATHLETE TO GO TO UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI TO PLAY BASKETBALL AND THEN MY VISION
AND DREAM WAS TO PLAY BASKETBALL GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND MY LAST PROFESSIONAL JOB WAS IN BELGIUM.
I WENT TOE A FARM IN BELGIUM WITH ONE OF MY TEAMMATES WHOSE FAMILY WAS IN FARMING AND AS
SOON AS I TOUCHED THE SOIL I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING I MISSED.
I HAD SOME HIDDEN PASSION FOR GROWING FOOD.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU BRINGING FARMING BACK TO SEIZE?
CITIES ARE BARELY A PLACE FOR HUMANS LET ALONE... DO YOU HAVE FARM ANIMALS ON THESE FARMS?
>> WE DO HAVE ANIMALS ON OUR FARMS AND MILWAUKEE, BUT THE REASON... THE PRACTICAL REASONS
IS WE HAVE MANY FOOD DID CERTS INSIDE OF MAJOR CITIES, LESS THAN 1% OF FOOD IS LOCALLY GROWN
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM EATING BAD FOOD.
