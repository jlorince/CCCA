BALLOT.
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS,
UNFORTUNATELY THE G.O.P. OF
SOUTH CAROLINA WILL NOT
CHALLENGE THIS RULING.
SO INSTEAD, CAN'T BELIEVE IT, I
TURNED TO THE DEMOCRATS,
SPECIFICALLY SOUTH CAROLINA
DEMOCRATIC CHAIR DICK HARD HART
FOOTLYIAN,.
I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD
CHALLENGE THE RULING.
JOINING US NOW TO DO OUR SUPER
PAC'S BIDDING, PLEASE WELCOME
SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC
CHAIRMAN DICK HARPOOTLIAN.
DICK, THANKS FOR COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, DICK, NOW, I HAVE NOT
SEEN YOU SINCE 2008.
ALL RIGHT.
I TRIED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN
SOUTH CAROLINA, AND YOU'RE ONE
OF THE GUYS WHO GOT ME KICKED
OFF THE DEMOCRATIC BALLOT.
[AUDIENCE BOOING]
YEAH, YEAH.
NOW WHY ON EARTH FOUR YEARS
LATER WOULD YOU BE HELPING ME?
DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE FACT THAT I HAVE UNLIMITED
CASH?
>> STEPHEN, THAT PROBABLY IS THE
ONLY FACTOR THAT WOULD AFFECT US
HERE.
>>
>> Stephen: IT SEEMS TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> IT IS THE DIFFERENCE.
>> Stephen: THIS REFERENDUM
ABOUT CORPORATE PERSONHOOD GOT
KICKED OFF THE BALLOT.
WE'RE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THAT
RULING.
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THESE
REFERENDUMS PUT BACK ON THE
BALLOT SO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH
CAROLINA CAN DECIDE WHETHER
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE OR
WHETHER PEOPLE ARE JUST PEOPLE.
SO WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU TO
PROVE THAT CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT, WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH
YOUR POSITION THAT CORPORATIONS
ARE PEOPLE.
WE THINK PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YOU ONLY SAY THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PEOPLE.
THAT SEEMS KIND OF RACIST OF
YOU.
>> THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
SUPREME COURT GUARANTEES THAT.
DON'T THEY GET A TRIAL BY A JURY
OF THEIR PEERS AND THE GECKO OR
GEICO FROM THE JURY BOX IT SITTING
THERE?
HOW LONG DO YOU CARRY THIS.
>> I THINK CORPORATIONS SHOULD
CARRY GUNS AND GET MARRIED.
CAN YOU CHALLENGE THIS RULING?
DO YOU HAVE STANDING IN THIS
CASE?
>> WE HAVE STANDING.
WE FILED A PETITION THIS WEEK.
>> Stephen: WAITED A SECOND.
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.
HOW CAN YOU HAVE STANDING IN
SOUTH CAROLINA?
I THOUGHT THE REPUBLICANS MAKE
YOU LIVE UNDER THE STAIRS LIKE
HARRY POTTER.
>> WE'VE ASSERTED OURSELVES FOR
YOU.
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR RIGHTS.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT'S HAPPENED
SO FAR?
>> WE FILED THE PETITION.
>> Stephen: THAT'S IT?
>> YEP.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO DO YOU THINK THAT WE'LL GET A
REHEARING ON THIS ISSUE?
>> [LONG EXHAIL]
>>
>> Stephen: WOW.
YOU REALLY ARE A DEMOCRAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GUYS DON'T
DO BETTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> YOU MAKE A APPOINTMENT
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO DECIDE
THINGS.
>> Stephen: IF YOU GET A
REHEARING AND WE WIN THE
REHEARING, WILL THIS RECOMMEND
ROUGH AND ALL THE OTHER
REFERENDA GO BACK ON THE BALLOT?
>> I THINK THERE IS A
SIGNIFICANT CHANCE THE
REPUBLICANS COULD PUT IT BACK ON
THEIR BALLOT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF THE
REPUBLICANS DON'T PUT IT ON.
COULD THE DEMOCRATS ISSUE A
REFERENDUM IF I PAID FOR IT?
>> IF YOU PAID FOR IT?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: I LIKE THAT.
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY,
PEOPLE?
