(LAUGHTER)NATION, PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME IF I
EVER GET TIRED OF BEING RIGHT.
AND I SAY TO THEM, "DOES STEPHENHAWKING EVER GET TIRED OF BEING
THE PRESIDENT OF ENGLAND?"THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
(CHEERING)FIRST UP, FOLKS, I'VE NEVER
LIKED THE SWISS. FIRST OFF,
THEIR CHEESE IS A COMPLETERIP-OFF, BUT NOW THEY'VE REACHED
A NEW LOW.
BECAUSE LATELY, SOME CUSTOMERSORDERING COFFEE AT SWISS CAFES
HAVE ALSO BEEN SERVED CREAMERPOTS WITH PORTRAITS OF ADOLF
HITLER ON THEM.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)FOLKS, I LIKE MY COFFEE HOW I
LIKE MY WOMEN -- WITHOUT HITLER.
(LAUGHTER)APPARENTLY, IN SWITZERLAND,
(LAUGHTER)APPARENTLY, IN SWITZERLAND,
LABELS FROM THE MINI-CREAMCONTAINERS ARE CULT
COLLECTIBLES, AND THE HITLERLABELS WERE ACCIDENTALLY PRINTED
AS PART OF A SERIES OF COFFEECREAM CONTAINERS BASED ON
VINTAGE CIGAR LABELS.
WHICH MEANS, AT ONE TIME,SOMEONE MADE HITLER CIGARS.
EVIDENTLY FOR THE CIGAR SMOKERWHO JUST WANTED TO BE HATED
THAT LITTLE BIT EXTRA.
(LAUGHTER)SO TONIGHT 'M GIVING A WAG OF
MY FINGER TO NAZI DAIRYPRODUCTS.
(APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THESE
CREAMERS ARE RIGHT TO BEFUEHRER-IOUS.
(LAUGHTER)AS ONE MAN PUT IT, "THIS IS JUST
ABSOLUTELY EVIL AND OUTRAGEOUS."
I AGREE!
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE THE SWISSFINALLY HAVE AN OPINION ON
HITLER.
(LAUGHTER)A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MAKERS OF
CREAMERS APOLOGIZED, SAYING, "ICAN'T TELL YOU HOW THESE LABELS
GOT PAST OUR CONTROLS."
HOW HARD IS IT TO SPOT HITLER ONYOUR PRODUCT?
THIS IS THE WORSTDICTATOR-RELATED MANUFACTURING
SNAFU SINCE BEN AND JERRY'SRELEASED "IDI A-MINT CHIP."
(LAUGHTER)NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM NOT JUST
THE HOST OF THIS SHOW, I AM ALSOHEAD OF MY OWN CORPORATION.
AND AS A CORPORATION KINGPIN, IFILED A QUARTERLY REPORT OF RAGE
WHEN I HEARD THIS.
>> ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOSTPOWERFUL C.E.O.s AS PUBLICLY
COME OUT OF THE CLOSET.
APPLE'S TIM COOK IS THE FIRSTFORTUNE 500 C.E.O. TO COME OUT
PUBLICLY AS GAY.
>> STEPHEN:  YES, APPLE C.E.O.
TIM COOK HAS COME OUT AS GAY.
WHICH MEANS TWO YEARS FROM NOWMICROSOFT'S C.E.O. WILL ALSO
COME OUT AS GAY.
(LAUGHTER)SO I AM GIVING A WAG OF THE
FINGER TO TIM COOK.
(APPLAUSE)AS A CORPORATE TITAN, HE SHOULD
FOLLOW TRADITION AND HIDE HISSEXUALITY IN THE CAYMANS.
(LAUGHTER)HE CAN VISIT IT ON HOLIDAYS!
WORSE, HE FEELS NO REMORSE ABOUTHIS DECISION TO BE BORN GAY.
QUOTE, "I'M PROUD TO BE GAY, ANDI CONSIDER BEING GAY AMONG THE
GREATEST GIFTS GOD HAS GIVENME."
OF COURSE, GOD GAVE HIM THATGIFT BECAUSE HE KNEW COOK
ALREADY HAD AN IPAD.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, FOLKS, IF THE C.E.O. OF
APPLE IS GOING TO STAND UP THEREAND DRAMATICALLY UNVEIL HIS
GAYNESS, I ONLY HAVE ONE THINGTO SAY...
BEING GAY LOOKS SO SLEEK ANDCOOL!
(LAUGHTER)I BET IT'S LOADED WITH GREAT
FEATURES LIKE AN ULTRA-THINPROFILE!
SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING, TIM COOK,GAY, PLEASE!
WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL WAIT.
IN SIX MONTHS, THEY'RE JUSTGONNA COME OUT WITH A GAYER
VERSION.(APPLAUSE)
AND FINALLY, THERE'S AN EXCITINGNEW
MEDICAL STUDY OUT OF THEUNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL -- I
BELIEVE I'M PRONOUNCING THATCORRECTLY -- JUST ON THE EDGE
OF CHOKING
AND SURPRISINGLY, IT WASN'TLINKING POUTINE TO EARLY-ON SET
EVERYTHING.
JIM?
>> FREQUENT SEX WITH MANYPARTNERS MIGHT REDUCE A MAN'S
RISKS OF DEVELOPING PROSTATECANCER.
THAT ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY.
RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITYOF MONTREAL STUDIED OVER 3,200
MEN AND FOUND MEN WHO HAVE SLEPTWITH 20 OR MORE WOMEN HAVE A 28%
LOWER RISK OF BEING DIAGNOSED.
>> STEPHEN:  THAT'S RIGHT,MULTIPLE PARTNERS REDUCE MEN'S
CANCER RISK.
IT TURNS OUT, THE BACHELOR HASBEEN AN 9-YEAR P.S.A. FOR
PROSTATE HEALTH.
(LAUGHTER)RESEARCH FOUND THAT FREQUENT
HUMPING, OR AS THEY CALL IT INMONTREAL "THE CANADIAN MOUNTIE,"
IS BENEFICIAL.
BECAUSE IT REDUCES CARCINOGENICCRYSTAL-LIKE SUBSTANCES IN THE
FLUID OF THE PROSTATE DUE TO AHIGHER FREQUENCY OF
EJACULATIONS.
SO REMEMBER, FELLAS, YOU WANT TOORGASM AT A HIGHER FREQUENCY.
AHHH!
GOD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SO CLEARLY, TO MAINTAIN THEIR
HEALTH, MEN NEED MANY WILLINGSEXUAL PARTNERS, OR SOME SORT OF
SUBSTITUTE FOR PROSTATE HEALTH,A PROSTATE-TUTE.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF
THE FINGER TO THESE RESEARCHERSWHO REFUSE TO WRITE US MEN A
PRESCRIPTION FOR MAN-WHORING.
BECAUSE, WHEN ASKED IF THISMEANT PUBLIC HEALTH, AUTHORITIES
SHOULD RECOMMEND MEN SLEEP WITHMANY WOMEN -- RESEARCHERS SAID
"WE'RE NOT THERE YET."
WELL, I BELIEVE I SPEAK ONBEHALF OF ALL MEN WHEN I SAY --
HOW ABOUT NOW?
ARE YOU THERE NOW?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
