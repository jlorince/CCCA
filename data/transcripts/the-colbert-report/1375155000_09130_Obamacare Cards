[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANKS.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
NATION, NATION, I HOPE YOU'RE
READY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOCK
YOUR LUNGS AND BATTEN DOWN YOUR
COLON BECAUSE OBAMA-CARE IS
COMING.
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE TAKES
EFFECT ON NEW YEAR'S DAY WHICH
MEANS WHEN THE TIMES SQUARE BALL
DROPS, IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BE
CHECKED FOR LUMPS.
WORSE, FOLKS, WORSE, THIS
BLOATED BUREAUCRATIC PROGRAM
THAT WILL NEVER WORK HAS STARTED
WORKING.
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND
HUMAN SERVICES ANNOUNCED IN 11
STATES AND WASHINGTON D.C.
PREMIUMS IN THE HEALTH CARE
MARKETPLACE REQUIRED BY OBAMA
CARE ARE TURNING OUT TO BE
NEARLY 20% LOWER THAN PROJECTED
FOR 2014.
>> Stephen: MAYBE SO.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE ANY
LONGER BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT,
MOST AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BLOW
THOSE SAVINGS ON CRONUTS.
AND THE DEATH SENTENCE, AND
OBAMA-CARE IS BEING IMPLEMENTED
DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF
HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE VOTED
TO SYMBOLICALLY REPEAL IT 39
TIMES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT
WORKING.
MAYBE THEY NEED TO LOAD MORE
EMPTINESS INTO THEIR GESTURES.
I DON'T KNOW NOW THE KEY TO
IMPLEMENTING OBAMA-CARE IS THE
SO-CALLED INDIVIDUAL MANDATE
BECAUSE TO KEEP PREMIUM COSTS
DOWN OFFICIALS SAY THEY MUST
REGISTER 2.7 MILLION HEALTHY
PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18
AND 35 IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT
THE COSTS OF ENSURING SENIORS
AND PEOPLE WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS.
DON'T FALL FOR IT, YOUNG PEOPLE.
YOU DON'T NEED INSURANCE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE YOUNG AND
HEALTHY FOREVER.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT ME.
I'M 19 LOOK AT THIS AWESOME
SKATEBOARD MOVE.
THAT IS CALLED POPPING A YOLO.
NOW FORTUNATELY, THE GODFATHER
OF THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT
FREEDOMWORKS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED
A "BURN YOUR OBAMA CARE CARD"
CAMPAIGN.
THAT'S RIGHT, YOUNG ONES.
PROTEST THIS GOVERNMENT
OVERREACH BY LIGHTING YOUR
INSURANCE CARD ON FIRE.
BUT BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF YOU
BURN YOURSELF YOU DON'T HAVE
HEALTH INSURANCE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SMALL PROBLEM
WITH THIS BURN YOUR OBAMA-CARE
CARD PLAN.
THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS
OBAMA-CARE CARDS.
BUT FREEDOMWORKS ISN'T LETTING A
LITTLE THING LIKE NOT EXISTING
GET IN ITS WAY AS THEIR VICE
PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY DEAN
CLANCY EXPLAINED.
>> FREEDOM WORKS IS GOING TO
DESIGN THE OBAMA-CARE CARD
OURSELVES.
WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ONLINE
AND SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE IN THE
HOPES THAT THEY WILL BURN IT,
TEAR IT UP, MARK ON IT.
>> Stephen: YES.
BURN IT.
TEAR IT.
MARK IT.
BUT FIRST PRINT IT, CUT IT AND
LAMINATE IT.
FREEDOMWORKS IS OPENING UP A
WHOLE NEW WORLD OF FIGHTING SIM
SYMBOLS OF INJUSTICE THAT DON'T
EXIST.
THEY SHOULD REFNT A BUS, ORDER
THEMSELVES TO SIT AT THE BACK OF
THE BUS AND THEN REFUSE TO SIT
AT THE BACK OF THEIR OWN BUS.
POWER.
THE POINT IS BURNING THINGS IS
ALWAYS AN ATTENTION GETTER.
AND FREEDOMWORKS SPECIAL EVENTS
MANAGER EMILIA HUNEKE-BERQUIST
EXPLAINED WHY BURNING THIS CARD
WAS SO NATURAL.
>> BACK IN THE DAY, JUST THE
SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT DECIDED
THAT EACH AND EVERY MALE IN THE
U.S. IS GOING TO NEED TO CARRY A
DRAFT CARD.
AND AS THE VIETNAM WAR GOT ARE
REALLY HEATED UP IN '65, '65
CITIZENS EVERYWHERE DECIDED TO
BURN THEIR CARDS IN PROTEST OF
THE ACTIONS BIG GOVERNMENT WAS
TAKING.
AND SO HERE WE ARE ABOUT 50
YEARS LATER, WE'RE FACING A NEW
KIND OF GOVERNMENT MANDATE UNDER
OBAMA-CARE AND SO WE'VE DECIDED
THAT WE'RE GOING TO TORCH OUR
OWN CARDS.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE FORGET THAT
ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR.
THOSE HIPPIES WERE JUST FISCAL
CONSERVATIVES PROTESTING A BIG
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE A WHOLE
GENERATION FORCED TO FIGHT
INFECTION IN SOME NEARBY COUNTY
HOSPITAL ONLY TO COME HOME IN
ONE PIECE WITH SOMETHING TO LIVE
FOR.
I MEAN, KEEP ON TRUCKING.
WELL I SAY IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
TRULY WANT TO RESIST OBAMA-CARE
THEY NEED TO DO WHAT VIETNAM
PROTESTORS DID IN THE '60s AND
MOVE TO CANADA.
BONUS: I HEAR THEY HAVE A GREAT
