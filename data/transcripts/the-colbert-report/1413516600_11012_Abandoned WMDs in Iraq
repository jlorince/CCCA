I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, I'VEJUST GOT TO LISTEN TO THIS,
HOLD ON ONE SECOND. HERE WE GO.
ONE, TWO, THREE!
♪ MY BABY DON'T MESS AROUND ♪ BECAUSE SHE SOMETHIN'
SOMETHIN' I KNOW FOR SURE... ♪ ♪ BUT DOES SHE REALLY WANT
OH I'M SORRY. I'M JUST LOVINGTHIS FEELING
BECAUSE I'M PARTYING LIKE IT'S2003.
I'VE GOT SOME "HEY YA!"CRANKING IN THE EARBUDS OF MY
ORIGINAL iPod ONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THIS THING IS AMAZING.
DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN STORE UP TO1,000 COPIES OF "HEY YA!"?
(LAUGHTER)I'M CELEBRATING LIKE IT'S 2003
BECAUSE, AT LONG LAST, WE'VE WONTHE WAR IN IRAQ.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NO, I'M SORRY, GUYS.
NO, JIMMY, THE EARLIER ONE.
NO, NOT THAT EARLY.
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE RIGHTTHERE!
THERE'S YOUR SWEET SPOT!
TELL 'EM WHY.
>> THIS IS A BIG ONE.
A BOMBSHELL NEW DISCOVERY BY THE"NEW YORK TIMES," WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION WERE FOUND INIRAQ BUT IT WAS KEPT SECRET.
THE "TIMES" REPORTING BETWEEN2004 AND 2011, AMERICAN TROOPS
FOUND 5,000 CHEMICAL WARHEADS.
>> 5,000 SHELLS AND BOMBSCONTAINING THINGS LIKE SARIN AND
MUSTARD GAS.
>> SADDAM DID HAVE WEAPONS OFMASS DESTRUCTION.
>> THE STORY SHOWS THAT, INFACT, SADDAM DID STILL HAVE
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN2003 WHEN WE INVADED.
>> Stephen: BUSH WAS RIGHT!
IRAQ HAD WMDs THE WHOLE TIME!
I FEEL A COMBINATION OF TWOSTRONG EMOTIONS -- OH, MY GOD,
SHOCK AND AWE!
(LAUGHTER)I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
WERE TALKING ABOUT, SIR!
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT ELSEBUSH WAS RIGHT ABOUT.
I BET SOME OF THOSE WEAPONS WERE"NUCULAR"?
(LAUGHTER)THIS VINDICATION MUST REALLY
WARM DICK CHENEY'S -- ARCREACTOR?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT INTHERE NOW.
NOTHING BUT NOTHING IS GOING TOKILL MY BUZZ OVER THESE WMDs
NOT EVEN THE SECOND LINE OFEVERY STORY ABOUT THEM.
>> THESE WERE NOT THE WEAPONS WEWENT TO WAR OVER.
THESE WERE OLD DISCARDED WEAPONS
>> THEY WERE NOT THE SO-CALLEDWEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
USED TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION.THEY WERE FROM THE OLD
SHELLS AND WARHEADSFROM THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.
>> Stephen: SHAKE IT, COME ONSHAKE IT, SHAKE IT LIKE A
POLAROID PICTURE. BEYONCE'S, ANDLUCY LIU'S, AND BABY DOLL'S.
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T CATCH A LOT OF THAT.
POINT IS, IRAQ MADE THESE AWFULWEAPONS, AND AMERICA HAD A MORAL
OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THEM ANDANYONE WHO HELPED THEM.
>> THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THEBITTEREST IRONIES OF THE IRAQ
WAR.
THESE ARE WEAPONS THAT IRAQ HADMANUFACTURED WITH HELP FROM
WESTERN COUNTRIES INCLUDING THEU.S. DURING ITS WAR WITH IRAN IN
THE 1980s.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO WE HELPED ARM THEM WITHCHEMICAL WEAPONS IN THE 1980s.
BUT COME ON, THERE ARE A LOT OFTHINGS WE REGRET FROM THE
'80s.
WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF WE ALSOARMED THEM WITH BUNS OF STEEL.
(LAUGHTER)AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHAT DONALD
RUMSFELD AND SADDAM HUSSEIN WERESHAKING HANDS OVER IN 1983!
HERE'S WHAT WE DID, ACTUALLYIT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY.
BACK WHEN IRAQ WAS FIGHTINGIRAN, TWO AMERICAN COMPANIES
PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF TONS OFTHIODIGLYCOL, A MUSTARD GAS
AGENT PRECURSOR, INCLUDING THECOMPANY CARDINAL STABILIZER, A
SPECIALTY CHEMICAL FIRM FROM MYHOMETOWN OF CHARLESTON, SOUTH
CAROLINA. WELL, NOW I FINALLYKNOW THE SECRET TO MY STATE'S
DELICIOUS BARBECUE -- A TANGYMUSTARD-GAS SAUCE.
SO GOOD YOU WILL CLAW YOUR EYESOUT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU WILL SLAP YOUR GRANDMA!
(LAUGHTER)AND THIS W-M-DISCOVERY IS NEWS
TO EVERYONE BECAUSE EVEN"CONGRESS WAS ONLY PARTLY
INFORMED" THESE WEAPONS EXISTED,WHILE "TROOPS AND OFFICERS WERE
INSTRUCTED TO BE SILENT OR GIVEDECEPTIVE ACCOUNTS OF WHAT THEY
HAD FOUND."
IT WAS SORT OF A "DON'T ASKDON'T TELL" FOR THE LGBT WMD
COMMUNITY.
