PLEASE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
, PLEASE, FOLKS, NATION, WITH US
TO HAVE YOU GOOD.
I'M SO OUTRAGED I CAN'T KEEP MY
SENTENCES STRAIGHTS BUT OUR
ENEMIES IN IRAN LED BY THEIR IF
A NAUTICAL AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI
HAVE PERPETRATED ANOTHER ATTACK
ON THE PEOPLE.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO INTERVENE

REFUSE TO WEAR TIES EVEN WHEN
FORMAL TIES ARE CALLED FOR.
THIS IS GARDEN ELEGANCE AT BEST
