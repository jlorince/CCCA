ARCTIC WILE LIFE PRESERVE
FOR DRILLING BECAUSE IT'S SO
SAD THAT ALL THAT OIL IS
TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE ICE.
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND THAT'S TED DANSON
PLAYING THIS GUY McGRAW WHO
IS A BIG OIL DRILLER.
BUT THE AMAZING THING ABOUT
THIS MOVIE IS YOU KNOW, OIL
COMPANIES AND I PLAY, YOU
KNOW, A TIGHT-ASS HIPPIE WHO
IS FIGHTING IT FOR
GREENPEACE.
>> Stephen: TIGHT-ASS
HIPPIE.
THAT SAY TOUGH COMBINATION.
>> BY THE WAY, IT WAS A
LITTLE HARD.
I WAS LIKE HOW DO YOU BE IN
PEOPLE'S FACE AND STILL BE
LIKABLE.
I PLAY THIS REAL LIFE WOMAN.
>> Stephen: I REMEMBER THE
STORY T IS INCREDIBLE.
IT CAPTIVATED THIS THE
WORLD.
>> IT WAS THIS BIG HUGE
SMALL STORY THAT GOT BIGGER
AND BIGGER AND IT WAS
BECAUSE NEWS MED
WHERE-- MEDIA PUT THE STORY
OUT THERE TOM WERE CAW WAS
APPARENTLY A SUCKER FOR
THESE STORIES.
>> Stephen: THREE WHALES ARE
TRAPPED IN THE ICY-- THE ICE
ICE-- IN SHOULD REALLY BE A
MOVIE.
NOW WHAT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW AND THIS WAS HUGE, RIGHT,
LIKE
INTERNATIONAL-- GOVERNMENTS
GOT INVOLVED.
>> THE AMAZING THING IS MY
CHARACTER WHO IS A
GREENPEACE ADVOCATES FIGHTS
AND FIGHTS AND FIGHTS AND
GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
TO GET THESE ICE BARGE
BREAKERS FROM THE NATIONAL
GUARD TO BREAK THROUGH.
AND THEN THE OIL COMPANIES
SEE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR THEM TO LIKE LOOK BETTER
AND BRING THEIR BARGES IN.
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THAT'S NOT WORKING SO THAT
THEY'VE GOT TO CALL, YOU
KNOW, THE WHITE HOUSE WHO
GETS INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO ELECT BUSH FROM THE
RECOGNIZE AN ADMINISTRATION.
>> Stephen: BUSH ONE.
>> WHO HAD A TERRIBLE
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD, ALL OF
THEM.
>> Stephen: HE'S A FRIEND,
WATCH OUT.
>> AND THEN THE WHITE HOUSE
WANTS TO LOOK GOOD FROM
THIS.
SO THEY START, YOU KNOW,
DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN.
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU
KNOW MY CHARACTER IS SAYING
LOOK YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IN
THE SOVIETS BECAUSE THEY ARE
THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN COME
IN AND BREAK THIS ICE.
AND THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T
WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF
THE COLD WAR.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW RONALD
REAGAN MY CHARACTER SAYS
FINE, IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU
KNOW, WANT TO DO THAT, WHEN
THE PEOPLE COME AND ASK ME
AS THE GREENPEACE LADY THAT
HAS BEEN SPEARHEADING THIS
WHOLE MOVEMENT, I'M GOING TO
TELL THEM THAT RONALD REAGAN
KILLED THOSE WHALES.
>> Stephen: EVENTUALLY
REAGAN WENT UP THERE AND
JUST PUNCHED A HOLE IN THAT
ICE.
SAID MR. GORBACHEV, TEAR
DOWN THIS GLACIER.
NOW LISTEN, IS THERE AN
ALBUM, BECAUSE YOU KNOW
ALBUMS SELL GREAT WITH SONGS
ASSOCIATED WITH MOVIES.
IS THERE AN ALBUM OF LIKE,
OF LIKE WHALING SONGS THAT
GO WITH THIS.

ANY GOOD WHALE SONGS.

SHE RISES EARLY IN THE
MORNING.
