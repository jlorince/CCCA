SET YOUR VC Cs.
NATION, IT PAINS ME, THAT IN A
COUNTRY OF SUCH WEALTH AS OURS,
THERE ARE STILL SO MANY IN
POVERTY, AND IT PAINS ME EVEN
MORE WHEN THOSE PEOPLE WON'T
STOP WHIENG ABOUT IT.
( LAUGHTER )
"I WANT A UNION.
I I WANT SAFETY REGULATIONS.
I NEED ALL MY FINGERS."
( LAUGHTER )
AND NOW THAT WHINING IS COMING
WITH A SIDE OF FRIES.
>> WALKOUTS BY FAST FOOD WORKERS
ARE SPREADING AROUND THE
COUNTRY.
THIS WEEK THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES
HAVE GONE ON STRIKE FOR A DAY.
THE MOVEMENT IS ABOUT MONEY.
>> EMPLOYEES FROM MCDONALD'S,
WENDY'S ANY OTHER CHAINS WANT
THEIR WAGES DOUBLED TO 15 BUCKS.
>> Stephen:  $15 AN HOUR.
WHAT DO THEY THINK, THOSE ARCHES
ARE MADE OF GOLD?
THE CONSEQUENCES, FOLKS, THE
CONSEQUENCES OF A WAGE INCREASE
ARE HORRIFYING TO CONTEMPLATE.
AT LAST COUNT THERE WERE 3.6
MILLION FRONT LINE CASHIERS,
COOK AND CREW IN AMERICA'S FAST
FOOD INDUSTRY.
A LIVING WAGE WOULD ELIMINATE
3.6 MILLION POOR PEOPLE.
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING HITLER
USED TO TALK ABOUT.
IF ONLY SOMEONE HAD BEEN AROUND
GIVE HIM A HAPPY MEAL.
LAYOFF LAUGH AND I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE WITH MAXIMUM RAGE OVER
THE MINIMUM WAGE, SO IS FOX NEWS
ANCHOR AND BURST TUBE OF
PILLSBURY CRESCENT ROLLS SO IS
NEIL CAVUTO.
>> DIEVER TELL YOU WHEN I WAS A

ANY JOB YOU COULD FIND.
NOW A LOT OF KIDS TURN UP THEIR
NOSES AT FAST FOOD JOBS AND GO
BEGGING AT $11.
A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD BE HAPPY
WITH ANY WAGE, ANY TIME.
>> Stephen:  NEIL AND I ARE
NOT FIXATED ON OUR HOURLY WAGE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MAKE AN
HOUR.
THAT MANY ZEROS GIVES ME
VERTIGO.
I WANT TO SUPPORT HIM IN MY NEW
SEGMENT, "RICH WHITE GUYS
AGREEING WITH EACH OTHER."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, IF YOU'RE OUT OF WORK,
YOU GET UP OFF YOUR SESAME SEED
BUNS AND TAKE ANYTHING YOU CAN
GET.
JUST LISTEN TO NEIL'S INSPIRING
STORY.
>> ALL I KNOW IS AS SOON AS I
TURNED 16 AND HEARD THAT A FAST
FOOD CHAIN CALLED ARTHUR
TREACHER WAS OPENING A STORR IN
MY DOWN IN DANBURY, CONNECTICUT,
I STOOD IN LINE FOR A POSITION,
ANY POSITION.
I I GOT THE JOB, AND SOON
ROCKETED TO RELIEF MANAGERS THEN
WEEKEND MANAGER AND THEN BY THE
TENDER AGE OF 16 AND A HALF
YEARS OLD FULL-BLOWN MANAGER.
IT ALL STARTED AT 2 BUCKS AN
HOUR.
>> Stephen:  YOU HEAR THAT
