>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, TRADITIONALLY THE FIFTH
ANNIVERSARY IS THE WOOD
ANNIVERSARY.
SO I'VE BEEN SUPPORTING SOME THE
ENTIRE SHOW.
( LAUGHTER )
AND AS ALWAYS, I'VE COMMISSIONED
ANOTHER PORTRAIT TO CAPTURE THE
SPIRIT OF THE PAST YEAR.
WELL, THE PAST 12 MONTHS I
TRAVELED TO VANCOUVER, WHERE I
WATCHED THE GREATEST ATHLETES IN
THE WORLD GET THEIR GREATEST
ASSES HANDED TO THEM BY MY SPEED
SKATING TEAM.
AND I WAS AWARDED A GRAMMY THIS
PAST YEAR FOR MY CHRISTMAS
SPECIAL.
NOW I'M JUST A TONY AND OSCAR
AWAY FROM A FREE LARGE SUBAT ANY
PARTICIPATING QUIZ KNOWS.
SO TO COMMEMORATE THE LAST YEAR,
HERE'S THE MOMENT I'VE ALL BEEN
WAITING FOR.
JIMMY, DRUM ROLL PLEASE.
[DRUM ROLL]
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?
IT'S LIKE A MAGNIFICENT
PAINT-BY-NUMBERS WHERE EVERY
NUMBER IS NUMBER ONE.
THANKS, EVERYBODY.
AND GOOD NIGHT.
