(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT JUST WON THENATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR HIS NEW
BOOK "THE UNWINDING."
I WONDER IF I HAVE TO READ "THEWINDING" FIRST.
PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE PACKER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HEY, GEORGE, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
IT'S BEEN ONE OR SIX YEARS SINCEYOU WERE LAST HERE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, TOO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A "NEWYORKER" STAFF WRITER.
YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF "THEASSASSIN'S GATE" WHICH WAS ABOUT
AMERICA IN IRAQ.
NOW YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK.
"THE UNWINDING: AN INNER HISTORYOF THE NEW AMERICA."
OKAY, I'LL BITE.
HOW ARE WE UNWINDING?
WHAT IS UNWINDING AMERICA OTHERTHAN, LET'S SAY, GAY MARRIAGE,
LEGALIZED POT, AND SOCIALIZEDMEDICINE?
(LAUGHTER)SHOULD I HAVE SAID SPOILER
ALERT?
DID I JUST GIVE AWAY THE BOOK?
>> THOSE ARE NOT THE BIG THEMESOF THE BOOK.
THE BOOK IS ABOUT HOW OVER THEON THE INSTITUTIONS INSTITUTIONS
THAT USED TO SUPPORT THE BROADMAJORITY OF AMERICANS LIKE
GOVERNMENT, LIKE NEWS MEDIA,LIKE CORPORATIONS, LIKE SCHOOLS
HAVE STOPPED WORKING ON BEHALFOF THE MAJORITY.
>> Stephen: CORPORATIONS AREDOING FINE, MY FRIEND.
>> THEY ARE DOING WELL.
BUT MOST OF AMERICA IS NOT.
SO WE'VE BECOME MORE AND MORE ACOUNTRY DIVIDED BETWEEN WINNERS
AND LOSERS.
LET ME JUST SAY, THIS IS NOT ANARGUMENT BOOK.
IT'S NOT A POLICY BOOK.
THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD BOOKSABOUT THIS SUBJECT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOTARGUING WITH THE BOOK?
>> I AM NOT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: SO IF WE WERE TOHAVE AN ARGUMENT, I'VE ALREADY
WON?
>> DOESN'T THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN?
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: CERTAINLY ONCE
WE'RE DONE EDITING.
(LAUGHTER)SO IT'S DESCRIBING THE STATE OF
AMERICA.
>> WELL, INSTEAD OF MAKING ANARGUMENT THAT YOU AGREE OR
DISAGREE WITH BUT QUICKLY FORGETIT GOES THROUGH THE LIVES OF
HALF A DOZEN AMERICANS ANDFOLLOWS THEM OVER THE COURSE OF
THE LAST 30 OR 35 YEARS, THEHUGE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND
THE WAY THEY'VE REACTED.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE BIGGESTCHANGE?
MY UNDERSTANDING HOW THE ECONOMYWORKS-- YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF
I'M WRONG-- IS THAT YOU WORKHARD, YOU PLAY FAIR AND YOU'RE
REWARDED.
THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM.
YOU KNOW?
AND -- PLAY BY THE RULES, YOUGET A HOUSE TO LIVE IN.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: AND THE BIGGESTCHANGE IS THAT NO LONGER WORKS
AND THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE INTHIS BOOK WHO WORK HARD,
BASICALLY PLAY BY THE RULES--THEY MAKE MISTAKES, THEY'RE
HUMAN-- BUT THEY END UP WITHVERY LITTLE OR NOTHING.
AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING OR EVENDROWNING AND THERE'S NO
STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT THEIRASPIRATIONS.
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN.
STPWHAOUP ARE THESE STRUCTURESTHAT WE USED TO HAVE?
>> A DECENT PUBLIC SCHOOLSYSTEM.
>> Stephen: WELL, PUBLICSCHOOLS RELY ON MY TAXES.
(LAUGHTER)I'M THE GUY PAYING FOR PUBLIC
SCHOOLS, MANY I KIDS GO PRIVATE,I CAN'T BE PAYING FOR THAT.
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
WHAT ELSE?
(LAUGHTER)AGAIN, WE'RE NOT HAVING AN
ARGUMENT.
WE'RE NOT HAVING AN ARGUMENT.
>> YOU MENTIONED CORPORATIONS.
IT USED TO BE THE CORPORATIONSHAD OTHER INTERESTS BESIDES
SHARE PRICE BUT WHEN THEY BECAMETHE ONLY GOAL OF C.E.O.s,
SHARE PRICE AND THEIR OWNSALARIES AND BONUSES THEY
STOPPED THINKING ABOUT THEIRWORKERS AS HAVING A KEY ROLE AND
HAVING CERTAIN RIGHTS AND ITBEING NECESSARY.
I MEAN, IN SOME WAYSCORPORATIONS --
>> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOU'REGOING POPE FRANCIS ON ME RIGHT
NOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I BET HE'S ACTUALLY A VERYPOWERFUL VOICE FOR THIS.
OBAMA QUOTED HIM IN A SPEECH HEGAVE ON INEQUALITY ABOUT A WEEK
AGO.
IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOME LEADERTALKING ABOUT THIS.
WE CAN'T FIND TOO MANY INWASHINGTON SO WE HAVE TO LOOK TO
THE VATICAN.
>> Stephen: OBAMA CALLED THEPOPE SOULFUL.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH I FOUND OFFENSIVE.
I DON'T WANT MY POPE DESCRIBEDLIKE BARRY WHITE.
(LAUGHTER)ARE YOU SAYING THAT I'M -- GUYS
LIKE ME WHO BELIEVE IN OURCORPORATE HEGEMONY NOW WHO
BELIEVE IN SMALLER GOVERNMENTAND LESS SOCIAL SERVICES THAT
WE'RE THE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLELIKE THAT?
>> STEPHEN, THAT IS VERY NICESET BUT YOU DID NOT BUILD IT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: GO ON, ELIZABETHWARREN.
>> SHE'S IN THE BOOK.
>> Stephen: OH, I BET SHE IS.
OH, I BET SHE IS.
I BET THERE'S A FOLDOUT OF HER.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TEN
WELL-KNOWN AMERICANS PROFILED INTHE BOOK AS WELL AS THESE FIVE
OR SIX PENAL YOU DON'T KNOW ANDI -- I ADMIRE HER BECAUSE SHE
HAS THE GUTS TO TELL BANKERSWHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR AND
THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE INPUBLIC LIFE WHO DO.
LOOK, WE HAVE -->> Stephen: SO WHAT DOBACKERS
NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT THEYSHOULD HEAR?
I'M HAVING A CHRISTMAS PARTYTONIGHT, I'LL TELL THEM.
>> THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THATDOESN'T WORK VERY WELL BECAUSE
PEOPLE WHO WORK AT WAL-MARTCAN'T -- CAN BARELY AFFORD TO
SHOP AT WAL-MART WHICH IS WHYBLACK FRIDAY WAS A BUST THIS
YEAR.
>> Stephen: THEY DON'T NEED TOBECAUSE WAL-MART ENCOURAGES
WORKERS TO GIVE EACH OTHER OLDCANNED FOOD.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: AND AS LONG ASTHEY'RE TRADING EACH OTHER DEL
MONTE PEAS WE'RE GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT I'M
NOT MAKING.
>> Stephen: I'M GLAD YOUDIDN'T BECAUSE I COULD KNOCK
THAT DOWN IN A MINUTE.
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT.
>> THERE ARE SIX SURVIVINGWAL-MART HEIRS THAT HAVE MORE
WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 42% OFAMERICANS.
NOW, THAT'S SUCH A GAP OFINEQUALITY THAT THE ECONOMY NO
LONGER WORKS AND PEOPLE ARECYNICAL AND THINK THE GAME IS
RIGGED.
WE DON'T EXPECT EQUAL RESULTS,BUT WHEN THE GAP IS SO WIDE,
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ITSELF SEEMSLIKE A SHAM.
>> Stephen: THERE IS EQUALOPPORTUNITY.
WHETHER IT'S LIKE ONE OF THEHEIRS OF WAL-MART OR, YOU KNOW,
SOME GUY WORKING A MINIMUM WAGEJOB, THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME
CHANCE TO WIN THE PICK 4 OF THEPOWERBALL.
(LAUGHTER)OR THE SCRATCHOFF.
THERE'S SO MANY OPPORTUNITIESTHAT THEY'VE SHARED AN EQUAL
CHANCE OF.
YOU WILL ADMIT THAT.
>> AND IT IS MORE AND MORE OF ALOTTERY.
BECAUSE KNOW WHO LONGER HAVE THEUPWARD MOBILITY THAT'S ALWAYS
BEEN OUR CLAIM TO BEING INEGALITARIAN SOCIETY.
EUROPE IS A MORE SOCIALLY MOBILEPLACE THAN THE UNITED STATES
NOW.
>> Stephen: YOU SHUT YOURMOUTH RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)SIR, HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE
ETERNAL TRUTH THAT AMERICA'SGREATEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF IT?
>> WE LIKE TO THINK THAT.
>> Stephen: OH, IT'S -- IT'STRUE!
THAT'S WHY WE LIKE IT.
AND AMERICA'S GREATEST DAYS AREALSO BEHIND IT.
IT'S RIGHT NOW!
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: AND ALWAYS HASBEEN!
(LAUGHTER)GEORGE PACKER, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
GEORGE PACKER, THE UNWINDING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
