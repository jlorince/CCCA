(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS
MEANS.
PLEASE, NATION, I APPRECIATE
THE WELCOME.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK
ABOUT.
LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
ALL THE SUPPORT YOU'RE
GIVING ME TONIGHT BECAUSE I
COME TO YOU WITH A HEAVY
HEART.
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE MY
PRESHOW COCKTAILS OF BOURBON
AND NUTELLA.
NO, FOLKS, I AM ENSADDENED
BY THE RECENT ANNOUNCED
RETIREMENT OF AN
CONSERVATIVE GIANT MICHELE
BACHMANN.
(LAUGHTER)
YES, TRUE.
THE CONGRESSWOMAN WHO
REPRESENTS MINNESOTA'S
VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.
SHE BROKE THE NEWS IN A WEB
VIDEO RECORDED AT, I BELIEVE,
THE SEARS PORTRAIT STUDIO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> JIM?
>> AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF
THOUGHT AND DELIBERATION I
HAVE DECIDED NEXT YEAR I
WILL NOT SEEK A FIFTH
CONGRESSIONAL TERM.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, NO
FIFTH TERM.
A POLITICAL CAREER OVER IN
THE BLINK OF AN EYE.
WHICH FOR MICHELE BACHMANN
IS ONCE EVERY EIGHT YEARS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS, DONE WORRY.
IN HER REMAINING TIME IN
OFFICE MICHELLE BACHMANN
WILL STAY FOCUSED ON HER
GOALS.
>> I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK
VEHEMENTLY AND ROBUSTLY TO
FIGHT BACK AGAINST WHAT MOST
IN THE OTHER PARTY WANT TO
DO TO TRANSFORM OUR COUNTRY
INTO BECOMING.
>> YES.
WE MUST FIGHT THOSE MOST
BEFORE OUR COUNTRY IS
TRANSFORMED INTO BECOMING.
STUPID MOST.
SO TONIGHT, FOLKS, WE SAY
GOOD-BYE TO MICHELE BACHMANN
AND LOOK FONDLY BACK AT SOME
OF HER VERY MOMENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS A
BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR
ENTITY.
THEY WANT TO BECOME THE
LENSCRAFTER OF BIG ABORTION.
>> IT'S A VERY SAD LIFE.
IT'S PART OF SATAN I THINK
TO SAY THIS IS GAY.
IT'S ANYTHING BUT GAY.
>> LEADS TO THE PERSONAL
ENSLAVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS.
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE'S
INVOLVED IN THE GAY AND
LESBIAN LIFESTYLE, IT'S
BONDAGE.
>> THE VERY FOUNDERS THAT
WROTE THOSE DOCUMENTS WORKED
TIRELESSLY UNTIL SLAVERY WAS
NO MORE IN THE UNITED
STATES.
>> THERE'S A WOMAN WHO CAME
UP CRYING TO ME TONIGHT
AFTER THE DEBATE.
SHE SAID HER DAUGHTER WAS
GIVEN THAT VACCINE.
SHE TOLD ME HER DAUGHTER
SUFFERED MENTAL RETARDATION
AS A RESULT OF THAT VACCINE.
>> THERE ISN'T EVEN ONE
STUDY THAT CAN BE PRODUCED
THAT SHOWS THAT CARBON
DIOXIDE IS A HARMFUL GAS.
>> OUR FATHERS THOUGHT
TAXATION WITHOUT
REPRESENTATION WAS BAD WA,
WOULD THEY THINK OF
REPRESENTATION WITH TAXATION.
>> I GOT TWO CUPCAKES FOR
YOU.
DID YOU GET THEM.
YOU WE GOT TWO CUP TAKES FOR
YOU, DID YOU GET THEM.
WE DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU LIKED
CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I WILL MISS HER.
THAT'S WHY I SENT HER TWO
FAREWELL CUP TAKES.
WE SENT HER TOO, DID SHE GET
THEM DID.
SHE GET THE TWO?
WHAT?
WHAT'S--
(LAUGHTER)
