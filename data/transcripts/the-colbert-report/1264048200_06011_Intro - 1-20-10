>> STEPHEN: TONIGHT,
MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS REBUKE
OBAMA BY ELECTING A CHARISMATIC
BUT INEXPERIENCED STATE SENATOR
WHO RAN ON A MESSAGE OF CHANGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN, I RACE GOLD MEDAL
SPEEDSKATER SHANI DAVIS.
DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?
NOT FOR LONG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND MY GUEST TONIGHT IS DICK
EBERSOL, HEAD OF NBC SPORTS.
BUT FIRST, THE TOUCHING HUMAN
STORY OF HOW I OVERCAME
ADVERSITY TO INTERVIEW HIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LOVE MEANS NEVER HAVING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY.
THAT'S WHY I NEVER APOLOGIZE TO
MY MIRROR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."
