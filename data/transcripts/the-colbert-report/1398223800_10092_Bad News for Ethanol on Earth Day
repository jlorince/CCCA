>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK!
THANKS SO MUCH FOLKS!
FOLKS, I WANT TAKE A MOMENT TOWISH YOU ALL A HAPPY EARTH DAY!
OF COURSE, AS EVERY YEAR, THISMORNING I HEADED OUT TO GET MY
TRADITIONAL EARTH DAY TREE.
JUST WALKED INTO THE PARK ANDCUT DOWN THE FIRST ONE I SAW.
BUT DON'T WORRY TREE-HUGGERS.
WHEN EARTH DAY IS OVER, I'LLRELEASE IT BACK INTO THE WILD.
I FEEL ESPECIALLY CLOSE TOMOTHER EARTH ON THIS EARTH DAY,
BECAUSE WE FINALLY HAVE PROOFOUR PLANET DOESN'T LIKE LIBERALS
ANY MORE THAN I DO.
NEWS THE GREENIES ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE TODAY.
A FEDERAL STUDY IS OUT, AND ITSHOWS COSTLY BIO-FUEL MADE FROM
CORN IS ACTUALLY WORSE FOR THEENVIRONMENT IN THE SHORT TERM
THAN STRAIGHT-UP GASOLINE.
LOOKS LIKE ETHANOL MAY NOT BE ASGREEN AS EVERYONE THOUGHT.
ETHANOL MADE FROM CORN RESIDUEMAY ACTUALLY BE MORE HARMFUL TO
THE ENVIRONMENT.
HA! HA!
HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
TRYING TO HELP IS POINTLESS!
YOU SEE, ACCORDING TO THE FIRSTENVIRONMENTAL STUDY, THAT I'VE
ENJOYED READING, MAKING ETHANOLBY REMOVING CORN LEFTOVERS FROM
THE FIELDS COULD ACTUALLY HURTTHE
ABILITY OF SOIL TO ABSORB CARBONDIOXIDE.
AND ABSORBING CO2 IS CRUCIAL TOOUR PLANET'S HEALTH, BECAUSE
THERE'S A 'TON' OF IT IN THE AIRFOR SOME REASON.
THIS STUDY IS THE FINAL NAIL INGREEN ENERGY'S BIODEGRADABLE
COFFIN.
TURNS OUT, EVERYTHING YOUTHOUGHT WAS GOOD FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT IS BAD.
WE ALREADY KNOW WIND POWERSEPARATES MIGRATING GEESE INTO
BIRD PEPPERONI.
SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIMEBEFORE WE LEARN THAT SOLAR POWER
RELIES ON CLUBBING BABY SEALS,BECAUSE THOSE SHINY PANELS ARE
MADE FROM THE GLEAM IN THEIREYES.
IT'S TIME TO FORGET ABOUT GREENENERGY AND DOUBLE DOWN ON
BLACK ENERGY.
THIS IS THE EARTH DAY WHEN WETAKE OUR PLANET BACK FROM THE
ENVIRONMENTALISTS.
FORGET PLANTING TREES OR PICKINGUP LITTER.
WE SHOULD ALL CELEBRATE LIKE FOXNEWS HOST ERIC BOLLING.
JIM?
>> IT'S AN ANNUAL EVENT.
IN MY HOUSEHOLD, WE OPEN ALL THEWINDOWS AND TURN UP THE HEAT OR
THE AIR CONDITIONING, WHICHEVERIS THE OPPOSITE OF WHATEVER THE
TEMPERATURE IS OUTSIDE AND I.
SPARK UP THE 90,000 BTU BARBECUEAND COOK SOME STEAKS.
>> WAY TO STICK IT TO THEGREENIES, ERIC!
MAN, I'D HATE TO BE THE DUMBASSWHO HAS TO PAY THIS GUY'S
UTILITY BILLS.WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
