GIVE THEM A TASTE OF WHATGENERAL WASHINGTON USED TO
CALL THE OLD WOODEN GROINBERRIES.

TO FORM THE REGIONALCOALITION THAT'S GOING TO BE

WHILE OBAMA'S SUIT SAYS I'MA GROOMSMAN IN AN AUGUST
WEDDING.
(LAUGHTER)BUT EVEN DAVID CAMERON PEALS
IN COMPARISON TO THE MAN IWOULD LIKE TO SEE LEAD US,
FRANK UNDERWOOD FROM HOUSEOF CARDS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> FOLKS, IF YOU HAVEN'T
STOLEN YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND'SNETFLIX PASSWORD YET FRANK
UNDERWOOD IS A WASHINGTONPOWER PLAYER WHO ROSE TO
PROMINENCE THROUGH LYING,SCHEMING, BACKSTABBING AND
MURDER.
BUT GETS THINGS DONE INWASHINGTON.

REALLY GREAT SHOW.
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO ISSPORTING SERIOUS UNDERWOOD,
JIM.

BIT OF FRANK UNDERWOOD ENVY.
