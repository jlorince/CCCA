[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU.
[audience chanting "stephen"]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
IT IS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT IS GOOD.
THAT IS GOOD.
GOOD.
FOLKS, PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE NEWS.
NATION, UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS
BEEN...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, IT HAS BEEN TWO DAYS
SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA INFLICTED
HIS JOBS BILL ON AMERICA.
NOW, I KNOW THIS PLAN IS
TERRIBLE, BUT I ALSO KNOW IT'S
200 PAGES LONG.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S
TERRIBLE.
[LAUGHTER]
LUCKILY THE FRIENDLY FRIENDS AT
FOX AND FRIENDS PUT THEIR
RESEARCH TEAM ON THE CASE, AND
THEY ZEROED IN ON THE FATAL
FLAW.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S JOBS BILL
HOT OFF THE PRESSES.
>> AT KINKO'S?
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN TAX
HIKES AND NEW SPENDING BOUND
TOGETHER WITH A CHINTZY CLIP.
LOOK AT THAT THING.
>> Stephen: YEAH, LOOK AT THAT
CHINTZY CLIP.
HE COULDN'T EVEN ASK AN INTERN
FOR A DUO-TANG, WHICH, IT'S
IMPORTANT TO NOTE, DOES NOT MEAN
THE SAME THING IT DID WHEN
CLINTON ASKED INTERNS FOR A
DUO-TANG.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND IN CASE YOU MISSED THE "FOX
AND FRIENDS" IN DEPTH ANALYSIS,
DO NOT WORRY, IT WAS ALL OVER
THE NEWS.
JIM?
>> COME ON, THIS IS YOUR JOBS
BILL.
THAT DESERVES A LARGE, SHINY
BINDER.
INSTEAD IT'S WITH A LITTLE CLIP.
>> WE NEED THE GOOD ONE FROM
KINKO'S, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU,
FOLKS, THE STORY OF CLIP-GATE IS
SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE ALL THE
WAY FROM FOX NEWS STUDIO E TO
FOX NEWS STUDIO J, BUT IT'S NOT
JUST FOX NEWS, FOLKS, THIS STORY
HAS BEEN PICKED UP ALL ACROSS
THINGS RUPERT MURDOCH OWNS, LIKE
YESTERDAY'S "NEW YORK POST"
"OGIVES JOBS CLIP SERVICE.
TACK HIKE PLAN BOUND BY CHINTZY
FASTENER."
YEAH, WHY SO CHINTZY?
IF HE REALLY BELIEVED IN THIS
BILL, HE SHOULD HAVE PRESENTED
IT IN A LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME
WITH GOLD FILIGREE AND
ILLUMINATED NISHES SO THE
REPUBLICANS HAVE SOMETHING
PRESENTABLE TO DISMISS BEFORE
THEY EVER LOOK AT IT.
PLUS, PLUS, IF THE PRESIDENT WAS
SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING AMERICANS
WORKING, HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN
THAT CLIPPED JOB TO AN
UNEMPLOYED PERSON.
