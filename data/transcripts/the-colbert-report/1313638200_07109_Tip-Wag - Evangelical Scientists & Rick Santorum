[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, A WISE MAN ONCE SAID,
"EVERYBODY SHUT UP.  STEPHEN'S
TALKING."
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, I LOVE THE STORY OF THE
GARDEN OF EDEN.
IT GIVES ME COMFORT TO KNOW THAT
EVERY TIME I SIN, IT'S REALLY
EVE'S FAULT.
[LAUGHTER]
BOY AM I GONNA BLAME SOME STUFF
ON YOU THIS WEEKEND!
[LAUGHTER]
-6-
THAT'S WHY I'M SO DISTURBED BY A
NEW MOVEMENT TO BREAK-UP THE
BIBLE'S MOST FAMOUS COUPLE.
NPR'S STEVE INSKEEP EXPLAINS.
>> FOR MANY EVANGELICALS, A
HISTORICAL ADAM AND EVE IS A
CRITICAL PART OF THEIR THEOLOGY,
BUT NOW SOME CONSERVATIVE
RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS ARE SAYING
PUBLICALLY THAT THEY CAN NO
LONGER BELIEVE IT.
>> Stephen: NO ADAM AND EVE?
NO APPLE?
NO TASTEFUL LEAF THONGS?
AND ALL BECAUSE THESE SO-CALLED
CONSERVATIVE SCIENTISTS SAY
"THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN BE
TRACED BACK TO A SINGLE
COUPLE...GIVEN THE GENETIC
VARIATION OF PEOPLE TODAY."
OH, THE GENETIC VARIATION NEEDS
MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE?
FINE, THEY HAD A FREAKY
THREE-WAY WITH THE SNAKE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE GENETIC
VARIATION OF JAMES CARVILLE.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO I'M ISSUING A WAG OF MY
FINGER AT EVANGELICAL
SCIENTISTS.
REAL CHRISTIANS LIKE PRESIDENT
OF SOUTHERN BAPTIST THEOLOGICAL
SEMINARY ALBERT MOHLER, KNOW
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.
>> WHEN ADAM SINNED, HE SINNED
FOR US AND IT'S THAT VERY
SINFULNESS THAT SETS UP OUR
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NEED FOR A
SAVIOR.
WITHOUT ADAM, THE WORK OF CHRIST
MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
WITHOUT ONE, THE OTHER CAN'T
EXIST.
IT'S LIKE HOW WITHOUT "HAPPY
DAYS," "JOANIE LOVES CHACHI"
MAKES NO SENSE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY WOULD ANY WOMAN LOVE A MAN
NAMED CHACHI?!
[LAUGHTER]
IF THERE'S NO GARDEN OF EDEN,
THAT MEANS JESUS' SACRIFICE
DOESN'T FIX ADAM'S ORIGINAL SIN,
AND ALL OF HIS TEACHINGS MAKE NO
SENSE WHATSOEVER.
THAT MEANS I'VE BEEN HELPING
PEOPLE AND FORGIVING THEM FOR
NOTHING!
[LAUGHTER]
THIS WHOLE TIME I COULD HAVE
BEEN BANGIN' MY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE
AND PUNCHING LEPERS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT MEANS ALL THE RULES ARE
CANCELLED.
I COULD HAVE PUT OTHER GODS
BEFORE HIM.
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE WANTED TO
EXPERIMENT WITH THE SHINTO SUN
GODDESS AMATERASU, OR THE HINDU
GODDESS OF PROSPERITY LAKSHMI?
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--ONCE YOU
GO LAKSHMI, YOU NEVER GO
BACK-SHMI!
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT, I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY GOP
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVE A TIP OF MY
HAT TO ONE CANDIDATE WHO STANDS
OUT BY TELLING IT LIKE IT IS:
RICK SANTORUM.
AT A RECENT CAMPAIGN STOP IN
IOWA FALLS, SANTORUM DELIVERED
THIS NUGGET OF WISDOM ON GAY
MARRIAGE.
MARRIAGE CAN BE BETWEEN ANY TWO
PEOPLE, ANY FOUR PEOPLE, ANY TEN
PEOPLE, ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
AND WE CAN CALL IT MARRIAGE. BUT
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT MARRIAGE.
>> I CAN CALL THIS NAPKIN A
PAPER TOWEL, BUT IT IS A NAPKIN.
WHY?
BECAUSE IT IS WHAT IT IS.
>> Stephen:  EXACTLY!
NAPKINS AND PAPER TOWELS ARE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.
IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES TO
LARGER, MORE ABSORBENT APPLES.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
RICK SANTORUM IS PUTTING THE
ISSUE OF GAY MARRIAGE IN TERMS
EVERYDAY PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU GIVE NAPKINS AND PAPER
TOWELS EQUAL STATUS, YOU
UNDERMINE THE SANCTITY OF THE
THING YOU USE TO PICK UP DOG
VOMIT.
[LAUGHTER]
SEE, NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN
RICK SANTORUM THAT YOU CAN'T
JUST REDEFINE SOMETHING TO MEAN
SOMETHING ELSE.
"SANTORUM" MEANS ONLY "FORMER
SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA." AND
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, YOU CAN
GOOGLE IT.
[LAUGHTER]
SO JUST AS MARRIAGE WILL ALWAYS
BE HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGE,
NAPKINS WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT THEY
ARE: INCREDIBLY GAY.
[LAUGHTER]
TO THINK THAT ALL THESE YEARS,
I'VE BEEN RESTING THEM ON MY LAP
AND TOUCHING THEM TO MY LIPS.
AND WHEN I HAVE RIBS, I USE AS
MANY AS I CAN GET MY HANDS ON --
I'M SUCH A SLUT!
[LAUGHTER]
AND SOMETIMES YOU EVEN STUFF
THEM THROUGH A RING, WHICH I NOW
UNDERSTAND JUST ENHANCES THEIR
PLEASURE.
WELL, THAT ENDS NOW.
I'M REPLACING ALL THE NAPKINS IN
MY HOUSE WITH PAPER TOWELS.
AND I'M GOING WITH THE
STRAIGHTEST BRAND OUT THERE:
BRAWNY.
[LAUGHTER]
HELLOOOO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
