(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW,
YOU KNOW I'M SOMETHING OF AN ART AUTHORITY.
A YEAR AGO I BECAME THE TOAST OF THE ART WORLD WHEN MY LIKENESS WAS ARTED UPON BY SHEPHERD FERRY
AND LOOKED AT BY THE FARE OF MINIMALISM FRANK STELLA.
THE RESULTING MASTERPIECE WAS PRAISED BY RENOWN ART CONNOISSEUR STEVE MARTIN WHO
PROCLAIMED ITS HANGING BRACKET STURDY.
THEN IT SOLD AT AUCTION FOR $26,000.
MEANING MY PAINTING MADE MORE MONEY THAN MOST ART TEACHERS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) SO I KNOW AN ART SUPERSTAR WHEN I SEE ONE, FOLKS, AND TONIGHT I
CELEBRATE A NEW ONE!
PAINTER JOHN McNAUGHTON WHO IS QUICKLY BECOMING THE DARLING OF CONSERVATIVE ART LOVERS.
>> ONE OF THE HOTTEST NEW TRENDS IS POP CULTURE IS THE ART OF UTAH PAINTER JOHN McNAUGHTON.
>> TO OUGHT OF THIS PAINTING.
THE OUGHT HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS I SAW, THE ENLIGHTNESS OF ALL
THESE PRESIDENTS WITH THE MESSAGE THAT IS THERE.
IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL AND MOVING THING.
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL THING AND A VERY MOVING THING WITH THE ART
AND THE MESSAGE THAT IS THERE.
(APPLAUSE) SORRY, LITTLE FROG IN MY THROAT.
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS MOVED.
ONE OF McNAUGHTON'S BIGGEST FANS, ART AFICIONADO AND TELEVISED BAG OF HAMMERS SEAN
HANNITY IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS CONCERNING
McNAUGHTON'S ART.
>> APPARENTLY THIS OTHER ONE...
I FIRST SAW IT ON THE DRUDGE REPORT, IT'S, WHAT, SIX FEET LONG?
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN AFFORD THE SIX-FOOT ONE.
>> Stephen: YES.
(LAUGHTER) FINE ART IS LIKE FINE FRUIT.
YOU SELL IT BY THE FOOT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT SEAN WAS ABLE... SEAN WAS ABLE TO AFFORD ONE McNAUGHTON
PAINTING, THIS MASTERPIECE, ONE NATION UNDER SOCIALISM.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) THERE'S THE PRESIDENT POINTING TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT HE HAS SET ON FIRE.
IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING.
(LAUGHTER) AS THE ARTIST SAYS "I LIKE TO USE METAPHOR AND MULTIPLE LEVELS OF MEANING."
IT'S COMPLICATED SO LET ME EXPLICATE THE PAINTING'S MESSAGE ON ITS MULTIPLE METAPHORICAL LEVELS.
BARACK OBAMA REPRESENTS...
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER) AND THE BURNING CONSTITUTION REPRESENTS... THE CONSTITUTION ON FIRE.
(LAUGHTER) I DIDN'T GET IT AT FIRST,
EITHER.
I'M JUST GLAD THE ART WORLD FINALLY HAS A GREAT CONSERVATIVE MASTER TO BALANCE OUT ALL THE
LIBERAL HACKS.
I MEAN, WE GET IT, JACKSON POLLOCK!
RAISE TAXES ON THE TOP 1% OF WAGE EARNERS TO REDISTRIBUTE THEIR WEALTH E THUS PRESERVING
THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET.
A LITTLE HEAVY HANDED.
(APPLAUSE) NOW, FOLKS, ONE NATION UNDER SOCIALISM... THEY LOVE IT.
THEY LOVE IT.
THEY LOVE THE JOHN McTPHAULGTON.
(LAUGHTER) NOW ONE NATION UNDER SOCIALISM HERE IS JUST THE LATEST OFFER IN
McNAUGHTON'S RICH AO *UFR.
(LAUGHTER) I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.
THIS IS AN ENCORE TO HIS EARLIER WORK "THE FORGOTTEN MAN" WHICH SHOWS OBAMA TRAMPLING THE
CONSTITUTION IN FRONT OF ALL THE OTHER PRESIDENTS AND IT'S SO LIFE LIKE YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR
THE FOUNDING FATHERS STANDING BEHIND HIM "WHO GAVE THAT SLAVE A SUIT?" (LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND, FOLKS, NO RETROSPECTIVE OF THIS BOUILLON CUBIST WOULD BE
COMPLETE WITHOUT MENTIONING HIS MASTERPIECE "ONE NATION UNDER GOD" WHICH DEPICTS JESUS
PRESENTING AMERICA THE CONSTITUTION HE JUST WROTE.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOUNDING FATHER JESUS IS SURROUNDED BY OTHER GREAT AMERICANS.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
RONALD REAGAN.
IT'S LIKE WHERE'S WALDO ONLY WHAT YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR IS THE
SMALLEST HINT OF SUBTLETY.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, HERE'S A TREAT.
HERE'S A REAL TREAT.
IF YOU GO TO McNAUGHTON'S WEB SITE YOU CAN SCROLL OVER THE FIGURES IN THE PAINTING FOR
EXPLANATIONS OF EVERY SYMBOLIC PERSON.
LIKE THE LIBERAL NEWS REPORTER.
SATAN.
AND MR. HOLLYWOOD.
(LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T REALLY BLAME MR. HOLLYWOOD FOR IMMERSING HIMSELF IN THE LIBERAL
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
I MEAN, WITH THAT NAME, WHAT OTHER PROFESSION COULD HE GO INTO?
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HAND IN HAND.
BUT, FOLKS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM ME THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT GROUND-BREAKING ART.
TAKE IT FROM THE NUMBER ONE JOHN McNAUGHTON FAN, JOHN McNAUGHTON.
>> THIS PAINTING IS GOING TO CHANGE AMERICA.
IT'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
>> Stephen: IT'S TRUE.
AFTER SEEING THIS PAINTING, THE ONLY THING I COULD SAY WAS "WHAT'S HAPPENING?"
(LAUGHTER)
