EVERY B&B I STAYED IN HADAIR.
PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN CHESKY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HEY, BRIAN! THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, YOU'RETHE CO-FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF
AIRBNB, A $10 BILLIONHOSPITALITY, HOSPITALITY
EXCHANGE COMPANY. WHATIS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AIRBNB
AND JUST HOME PROSTITUTION?BECAUSE YOU'RE SELLING YOUR
HOUSE THERE. SOME OF THESEHOUSES ARE LITERALLY ON
STREET CORNERS.
>> WELL, THE WHOLE IDEA IS WEHAVE THIS IDEA, WHAT IF YOU
COULD FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HOMEANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS TAKETHE STRANGERS OUT OF IT. SO...
>> Stephen: WELL, I HAVE HOMESALL OVER THE WORLD.
I CAN ALREADY DO THAT.
>> SO, THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CANSEE WHO YOU'RE BOOKING WITH, YOU
GET TO VIRTUALLY MEET THEMBEFORE AND WITH THE CLICK OF A
BUTTON YOU CAN LITERALLY HAVE ACASTLE IN IRELAND, A BOAT OFF
THE COAST OF CAPE TOWNOR ONE OF 34,000 HOMES IN
PARIS.
>> Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW THATTHE PERSON I'M STAYING WITH
IS NOT GOING TO KILL MEAND WEAR MY SKIN?
(LAUGHTER)>> SO THE WHOLE IDEA WAS
THAT THERE ARE NOSTRANGERS HERE.
YOU GET TO VIRTUALLY MEETPEOPLE, SO YOU SEE THEIR
PROFILE...>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> AND THE WHOLE THING WORKS OFFOF REPUTATION OF TRUST.
SO, YOU GET TO READ THE REVIEWSOF PEOPLE WHO STAYED WITH
THESE PEOPLE BEFORE THIS HOST.AND YOU CAN READ THE REVIEWS.
AND YOU CAN VIRTUALLY MEET THEM,YOU CAN MESSAGE THEM WHEN YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE. AND YOU JUST BOOK.
>> Stephen: WHAT INSPIRED YOU TODO THIS?
>> WELL, I WAS ACTUALLY, I MOVEDTO SAN FRANCISCO WITH MY
ROOMMATE JOE GEBBIA AND WECOULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY RENT.
THERE WAS A DESIGN CONFERENCECOMING TO SAN FRANCISCO,
ALL THE HOTELS WERE SOLD OUT. SOWE HAD THIS IDEA, LET'S JUST
TURN OUR HOUSE INTO A BED ANDBREAKFAST FOR THE CONFERENCE.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'THAVE ANY BEDS.
JOE HAD THREE AIR -- WE'D JUSTMOVED UP THERE.
AND I WAS TOTALLY BROKE AT THISPOINT.
JOE PULLED THREE AIR BEDS OUT OFTHE CLOSET, HE INFLATES THEM AND
WE REALIZE IT'S NOT A BED ANDBREAKFAST.
IT'S AN AIR BED AND BREAKFAST.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY IT'SCALLED AIR B & B! OK!
>> YES.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: NOW THIS IS
SOMETIMES CALLED THENEW SHARING ECONOMY.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I MISSED THE DAYIN KINDERGARTEN WHERE THEY
TAUGHT US ABOUT SHARING.>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I DON'T LIKE IT. ALLRIGHT?
>> OKAY.(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHAT? YOU'VE, WE'VEGOT UBER, YOU'VE GOT
TASK RABBIT, YOU'VE GOT YOUGUYS...
>> AND YOU'VE GOT...>> Stephen: EVENTUALLY, WILL
EVERYONE, YOU KNOW, BELOW THE 1%JUST BE HELPING EACH OTHER?
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS TAKINGOFF?
>> I THINK THIS IS TAKING OFFBECAUSE WITH THE, WHAT
THE SHARING KIND OF REALLY MEANSIS NOW PEOPLE IN 60 SECONDS CAN
BECOME MICROENTREPRENEURS. YOUCAN ADD A REPUTATION.
IF YOU HAVE A SKILL, AN ASSETYOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE.
YOU CAN SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODYAND IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT ECONOMIC CLASSYOU'RE A PART OF. I THINK
WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS, I THINK,IS THAT PEOPLE NOW HAVE THE
POWER TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS.
>> Stephen: OK, WHO DOESN'T LIKEYOU BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOTTEN SOME HEAT FROMVARIOUS CITIES AND FROM HOTEL
CHAINS ABOUT THIS, HAVEN'T YOU?
>> I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARERESISTANT...
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOUNOT?
>> WE HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BITOF RESISTENCE.
>> Stephen: GOT A LITTLE BITOF HEAT?
>> GOT AN LITTLE BIT OFHEAT, YES.
>> Stephen: OK. ALL RIGHT, SOWHY?
>> YES. I THINK THAT THERE ARESOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO
CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW, WE
LAUNCHED DURING THE ECONOMICCRISIS OF 2008 AND THERE WERE
PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEEDEDTHIS CHANGE TO HAPPEN AND I
THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A GOODTHING FOR THE WORLD.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: BUT YOU GUYS ARE
COMPETING, YOU GUYS, YOU GUYSARE COMPETING WITH THESE HUGE
HOTEL CHAINS, AND I GUESS WHATI'M ASKING IS:
SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE THE SAMERIGHTS AS CORPORATIONS?
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW, AIRBNB IS A
CORPORATION AND WE STARTED -- IWAS THE FIRST HOST WITH JOE ON
AIRBNB. I BELIEVE THAT,YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY EVERYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE INTHE ECONOMY LIKE A CORPORATION
AND BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR.
>> Stephen: DO YOU STILL USEIT?
>> I STILL USE IT. I'M STILL AHOST AND I'M STAYING HERE
TONIGHT IN NEW YORK ACTUALLYACROSS FROM YOU IN
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
>> Stephen: OH REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER HADA BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE
AIRBNB?
>> I HAVE NOT HAD A BADEXPERIENCE. WELL ACTUALLY...
>> Stephen: AS THE C.E.O., IFYOU HAD SAID YES,  I WOULD HAVE
FIRED YOU.
>> I DID STAY WITH A WOMANWHO HAD A PARROT AND THAT WAS A
LITTLE AWKWARD. BUT...
>> Stephen: ONE, ONE OF MYWRITERS WHO RECENTLY JOINED US
AT THE SHOW, SHE STAYED ATAN AIRBNB FOR ABOUT A MONTH
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND WHEN SHE LEFT,THE HOST GAVE
HER A WIDE SCREEN TV AND TWONAKED MANNEQUINS.
IS THAT STANDARD PROTOCOL?
>> WELL, I THINK THE IDEA ISTHAT, LIKE, A LITTLE BIT YOU
NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TOGET, AND I THINK THAT LIKE MANY
PEOPLE BECOME FRIENDS AFTERAND THERE'S THIS WONDERFUL
CULTURAL EXCHANGE. YOU KNOW,JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE,
TONIGHT AROUND THEWORLD 375,000 PEOPLE ARE
STAYING TOGETHER AND LIVINGTOGETHER IN 160 COUNTRIES.
