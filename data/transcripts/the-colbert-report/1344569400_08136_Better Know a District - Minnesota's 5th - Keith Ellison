SADLY BACHMANN'S BIGGEST CRITIC IS FELLOW MINNESOTAAN KEITH ELLISSON WHO -- SURPRISE
SURPRISE IS THE NATION'S FIRST MUSLIM CONGRESSMAN.
WHO KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD ELECT SOMEONE LIKE THAT TO CONGRESS.
LET'S FIND OUT IN THE 67th INSTALLMENT OF MY SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT.
TONIGHT MINNESOTA'S FIVEth.
THE FIGHTIN' FIFTH!
THE FIFTH DISTRICT MADE HISTORY BACK IN 1855 WHEN THEY OPENED THE HENNEPIN AVENUE BRIDGE, THE
FIRST BRIDGE THAT ALLOWED EASTBOUND TRAVELERS TO CROSS THE MISSISSIPPI OR IF THEY WERE
HEADED WEST THE IPPISSISSIM.
THE CITIES ARE NEW HOPE WHICH IS SUPERIOR TO NEIGHBORING CITIES ATTACK OF THE CLONES, WISCONSIN.
THE FIFTH CONTAINS THE WALKER ART CENTER WHICH FEATURED THE BOONBRIDGE AND CHERRY SCULPTURE,
A TESTAMENT TO THE CITY'S LOVE OF ART AS WELLS A REALISTIC DEPICTION OF MIDWESTERN PORTION SIZES.
