OF COURSE, THE INTERNET ISN'TTHE ONLY PLACE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL
SECURE.
THERE'S ALSO EVERYWHERE ELSE.
TAKE LAST MONTH'S UNREST INFERGUSON, MISSOURI.
IT RAISED A LOT OF TROUBLINGQUESTIONS.
FOREMOST AMONG THEM-- IS JAKETAPPER GOING TO BE OKAY?
>> THESE ARE ARMED POLICE WITHSEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES WITH
BATONS, WITH SHIELDS, MANY OFTHEM DRESSED FOR COMBAT.
NOW, WHY THEY'RE DOING THIS, IDON'T KNOW, BECAUSE THERE IS NO
THREAT GOING ON HERE, NONE, THATMERITS THIS.
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON, ONTHIS STREET RIGHT NOW, THAT
MERITS THIS SCENE OUT OF BAGRAM,NOTHING.
WHAT IS THIS?
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
>> Stephen:  NOW, JAKE IS AFRIEND SO IT IS WITH THE
GREATEST RESPECT I SAY YOU'RE ANIDIOT.
( LAUGHTER )THE COPS DON'T NEED ARMORED
PERSONNEL CARRIERS BECAUSETHERE'S NO VIOLENCE.
THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE BECAUSETHE COPS HAVE ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIERS.
SAME REASON I DON'T NEED TO HAVESEX BECAUSE I'M CARRYING A
CONDOM.
( LAUGHTER )9/11 SHOWED US JUST HOW
VULNERABLE WE ARE TO VIOLENTATTACK.
THAT'S WHY TODAY I LIVE IN THEGATED COMMUNITY WITH A FENCE NO
TERRORIST COULD POSSIBLY BREACH,UNLESS THEY SOMEHOW ACQUIRE
STOOL TECHNOLOGY.
( LAUGHTER )SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THE SAME
STATE-OF-THE-ART SECURITYCAMERAS THAT PROTECT TIMES
SQUARE ALSO PROTECTS SCOTSBLUFF,NEBRASKA, POPULATION 15,039.
SORRY, AL QAEDA, BUT THEHISTORIC LAKE MINA-TARE
LIGHTHOUSE WILL NEVER STOPSHINING.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S NOT A FUNCTIONALLIGHTHOUSE?
YOU WIN THIS ROUND, BIN LADEN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ), OF COURSE, CAMERAS ALONE WON'T
SECURE OUR SHORES, SO CONGRESSPASSED THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
EXCESS PROPERTY PROGRAM WHICHDISTRIBUTES SURPLUS MILITARY
EQUIPMENT TO STATE AND LOCAL LAWENFORCEMENT.
IT'S ALL PART OF THE PENTAGON'SONGOING "TAKE A TANK, LEAVE A
TANK" PROGRAM.
AND IT HAS DONE WONDERS FORLITTLE TOWNS LIKE KEENE, NEW
HAMPSHIRE, WHICH OBTAINED ASURPLUS $286,000 BEARCAT ARMORED
VEHICLE, WHICH THEY SAID THEYNEEDED BECAUSE THE THREAT IS
FAR-REACHING AND OFTENUNFORESEEN.
KEENE CURRENTLY HOSTS SEVERALLARGE PUBLIC FUNCTIONS TO
INCLUDE AN ANNUAL PUMPKINFESTIVAL.
( LAUGHTER )DEFINITELY A TARGET.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'SPREMIERE PUMPKIN FESTIVAL.
NEED PROOF?
( LAUGHTER )AND IT'S NOT JUST SPREADING TO
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, FOLKS.FEDERAL AGENCIES
ARE ALSO FORMING SWAT TEAMS,INCLUDING THE RAILROAD
RETIREMENT BOARD, THE CONSUMERPRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION, AND
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A
GENETICALLY MODIFIED EAR OF CORNMIGHT COME AROUND LOOKING FOR A
LITTLE PAYBACK.
