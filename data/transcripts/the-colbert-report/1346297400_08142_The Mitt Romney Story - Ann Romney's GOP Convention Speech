(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, WHO BETTER THAN MITT ROMNEY'S WIFE ANN TO TELL THE MITT ROMNEY STORY?
OR, AS SHE CALLS MITT ROMNEY.
MITT ROMNEY.
MITT ROMNEY.
MITT ROMNEY.
HIS NAME IS MITT ROMNEY!
>> Stephen: IT'S A PET NAME.
IT'S A PET NAME.
ALL COUPLES HAVE THEM.
I'M SURE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS MITT CALLS HER "MRS. MITT ROMNEY." (LAUGHTER)
NOW, RIGHT AWAY ANN ADDRESSED THE MYTH THAT THEY LIVED A LIFE OF PRIVILEGE.
>> WE GOT MARRIED AND MOVED INTO A BASEMENT APARTMENT, ATE A LOT OF PASTA AND TUNA FISH.
OUR DESK WAS A DOOR CROPPED UP ON SAW HORSES.
OUR DINING ROOM TABLE WAS A FOLD DOWN IRONING BOARD IN THE KITCHEN.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU IMAGINE?
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO AWKWARD WHEN THE MAID INTERRUPTED THEIR DINNER TO IRON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND, HEY, NOT EASY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND, HEY, UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE OUT THERE, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
THERE WERE YEARS WHEN THE ROMNEYS DIDN'T WORK-- BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T NEED TO.
(LAUGHTER) AS ANN TOLD THE "BOSTON GLOBE" "NEITHER ONE OF US HAD A JOB
BECAUSE MITT HAD ENOUGH OF AN INVESTMENT FROM STOCK THAT WE COULD SELL OFF A LITTLE AT A
TIME." SO HARD.
(LAUGHTER) THEY WERE LIVING HAND-TO-PHONE-TO-STOCKBROKER-TO- MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER) AND AFTER... HA TOUGH, TOUGH,
TOUGH.
AFTER TELLING MITT'S STORY, ANN THEN CONNECTED WITH A SMALL GROUP OF FORGOTTEN VOTERS.
>> WE'RE THE MOTHERS.
WE'RE THE WIVES.
WE'RE THE GRANDMOTHERS.
WE'RE THE BIG SISTERS.
WE'RE THE LITTLE SISTERS.
AND WE ARE THE DAUGHTERS.
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE, DON'T YOU?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I LOVE YOU WOMEN!
>> Stephen: AND WE LOVE YOU BACK!
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, THEY!
I MEAN THEY!
THEY LOVE YOU BACK!
I CERTAINLY HOPE MITT OPENS HIS SPEECH WITH "I LOVE YOU, MEN!" (LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, THE SPEECH WAS A COMPLETE TRIUMPH WITH ANN SETTING THE THEME OF THE ENTIRE NIGHT.
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT NOT ABOUT POLITICS AND NOT ABOUT PARTY.
TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LOVE.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.
>> Stephen: YES.
LOVE.
A MESSAGE THAT THE NEXT SPEAKER,
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE BROUGHT HOME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE RESPECT OVER LOVE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELL, HE'S THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
HE... UM... HE BROUGHT IT HOME,
SHOT IN THE THE HEAD AND DUMPED IN THE THE MEADOWLANDS.
(LAUGHTER) NOT... NOT PRETTY.
NOT PRETTY, FOLKS, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FROM A LEADER!
>> TONIGHT OUR DUTY IS TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH.
OUR PROBLEMS ARE BIG AND THE SOLUTIONS WILL NOT BE PAINLESS.
WE ALL MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND ANY LEADER THAT TELLS US DIFFERENTLY IS SIMPLY
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.
>> YES.
TRUE RESPECT MEANS TELLING PEOPLE SOME HARSH TRUTHS!
FOR INSTANCE, YOU'RE FAT.
(LAUGHTER) WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
PLEASE, EAT A VEGETABLE.
A SALAD.
(LAUGHTER) WE WANT YOU TO LIVE A LONG TIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RESPECT.
THAT'S FROM A PLACE OF RESPECT.
(LAUGHTER) AND REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO TELL HARD TRUTHS.
AFTER ALL, THIS CONVENTION IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO NEVER WANTED TO HEAR THAT THE NOMINEE WAS
MITT ROMNEY!
