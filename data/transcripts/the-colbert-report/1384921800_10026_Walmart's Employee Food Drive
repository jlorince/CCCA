SET.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANKYOU FOR JOINING US ON THIS
BRIGHT EVENING.
NATION, AMERICA WAS BUILT ON TWOTHINGS: A STRONG WORK ETHIC AND
INDIAN BONES.
(LAUGHTER)BUT MOSTLY THE HARD WORK.
THAT'S WHY AS A MAKER I AM SICKOF THE LOW-DMK TAKERS OUT THERE
ALWAYS ASKING FOR MORE.
>> PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING, THEYNEED A LIVING WAGE, THEY CAN'T
SURVIVE OFF THE $7 OR $8 ANHOUR.
>> THE MINIMUM WAGE IS STILL NOTA LIVING WAGE.
>> TODAY THE MINIMUM WAGE ISLESS THAN WHAT IT WAS IN 1963.
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT JUSTMEANS THE MINIMUM WAGE IS I
HAVEN'TAGE.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO WAGES
THERE'S NO COMPANY THE GREEDYUNDERCLASS LOVES TO ATTACK MORE
THAN WAL-MART.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM THEMIN?
THEY ALREADY GIVES YOUAFFORDABLE ACCESS TO PLUS-SIZE
KAMO BATHROBES.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW, FOR WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE
KICKING BACK AND HUNTING.
(LAUGHTER)BESIDES, WAL-MART HAS PROVEN
THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR LOW-WAGEWORKERS.

THE STORE SET UP SOME STORAGEBINS WITH A SIGN THAT READ
"PLEASE DONATE FOOD ITEMS HEREIS THAT ASSOCIATES-- THAT'S WHAT
WAL-MART CALLS ITS EMPLOYEES--IN NEED CAN ENJOY THANKSGIVING
DINNER."

PROOF OF ITS EFFORT TO TAKE CAREOF EMPLOYEES.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Stephen: THANK YOU, RABBI.

OF ITS EMPLOYEES!

SAYING WAL-MART ISN'T DOINGENOUGH BUT THEY'RE WRONG BECAUSE
WAL-MART ISN'T DOING ANYTHING!

EMPLOYEES TO DONATE TO OTHEREMPLOYEES.

LOW-WAGE WORKERS FIND CHEAP FOODTO DONATE?
