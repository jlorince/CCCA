NATION, WITH ALL THE HUBBUB OF
THE HOLIDAY, SOMETIMES YOU LOSE
TRACK OF WHAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT, BEING MAD AT GAY
PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, LAST WEEK I HAD ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ENRAGED
BECAUSE PROP 8, THE CALIFORNIA
BAN ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, WHICH
WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAST
SUMMER, WAS CHALLENGED IN
FEDERAL COURT, AND THIS TIME THE
GAY-VOLUTION WAS TELEVISED.
NOW, TV CAMERAS IN FEDERAL COURT
IS RARE.
NO ONE LIKES TO SEE HOW THE
SAUSAGE IS NOT ALLOWED TO MARRY
OTHER SAUSAGE.
FIGHTING FOR GAY MARRIAGE, YOU
GOT A SURPRISING DUO, DAVID
BOIES AND THE END OLSEN, WHO
WERE THE OPPOSING LAWYERS IN
BUSH V. GORE.
EVIDENTLY GAY MARRIAGE MAKES FOR
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, NOT THAT I'M
SAYING THAT THEY'RE BEDFELLOWS.
I'M JUST SAYING THESE LAWYERS
SEEM TO ENJOY EACH OTHER'S
BRIEFS.
( LAUGHTER )
I KNOW.
PLEASE.
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE
PEOPLE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE HAVE
A PROBLEM AS JEFFREY DOOB TOOBIN
EXPLAINS FROM HIS UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION.
>> THE USUAL DEFENDANTS ARE THE
GOVERNOR AND THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THAT STATE, BUT THE
GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
CALIFORNIA, ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER AND JERRY BROWN,
BOTH AGREE WITH THE PLAINTIFFS,
THAT PROPOSITION 8 IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
GAY MARRIAGE IS A SIN, BUT A
REPUBLICAN AGREEING WITH A
DEMOCRAT?
THAT IS AN ABOMINATION.
AND SINCE FRICK AND FRACK OVER
HERE WOULDN'T APPEAL IT, SOMEONE
ELSE HAD TO STEP UP TO FIGHT FOR
AMERICAN'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
TO TAKE AWAY OTHER AMERICANS
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
THE WEB SITE PROTECT MARRIAGE
DOTTED COM, AN ORGANIZATION
DEDICATED TO FIGHTING FOR
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE BY FUNDING
WHAT THEIR WEB SITE CALLS
ACADEMIC RESEARCH WHICH
DEMONSTRATES WHAT WE ALREADY
KNOW.
I SAY STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE
WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW ARE THE
BEST KIND OF RESEARCH.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S WHY I COMMISSIONED THE
GROUNDBREAKING STUDY, "SPANISH,
CAN I SPEAK IT?"
THE ANSWER, NYET.
NOW, TRAGICALLY THE APPEALS
COURT MAY DISMISS PROTECTED
MARRIAGE.COM'S APPEAL BASED ON A
LEGAL PRINCIPLE CALL "STANDING,"
EXPLAINED HERE BY DAVID BOIES.
>> IN ORDER TO HAVE THE ABILITY
TO INVOKE THE JURISDICTION OF
THIS COURT, THE APPELLANTS HERE
MUST HAVE A PERSONAL, CONCRETE,
PARTICULARIZED INJURY, AND THEY
DON'T.
>> Stephen: THAT IS
RIDICULOUS.
OVERTURNING PROP 8 WOULD INJURE
EVERY STRAIGHT PERSON.
IF IT'S OKAY TO MARRY MAN, WHY
WOULDN'T ALL MEN DO IT?
( LAUGHTER )
A, MEN KNOW WHAT MEN LIKE.
AND B, IT WOULD SPLIT UP SOME OF
THE PICKLE JAR OPENING.
SO CLEARLY, I'M EXHAUSTED,
CLEARLY PROP 8 WILL EVENTUALLY
END UP BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT,
BUT BEFORE IT DOES THAT, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, IT HAS TO APPEAR
BEFORE A HIGHER AUTHORITY, ME.
HERE TO PRESENT HIS CASE IS ONE
OF THE RENOWNED BUT DEEPLY
MISGUIDED LAWYERS ARGUING FOR
GAY MARRIAGE, DAVID BOIES.
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, DAVID, WHY WON'T ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER AND JERRY BROWN
APPEAL THIS DECISION?
>> BECAUSE THE DECISION BELOW IS
COMPLETELY CORRECT.
IT WAS 100% RIGHT.
AND THEY SEE THEY HAVE NO CHANCE
TO WIN ON APPEAL.
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS, BECAUSE
YOU'RE A BIG OLD LIBERAL,
BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT AL GORE.
WHY DOES TED OF SEN DO IT?
>> THESE ARE CONSERVATIVE
VALUES.
THESE ARE FAMILY VALUES.
>> Stephen: FAMILY VALUES.
GAY PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE FAMILIES.
>> OF COURSE THEY CAN.
>> Stephen: THEY CAN'T MAKE
BABIES.
THEY HAVE TO BUY READY-MADE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> SOMETIMES THEY'RE ALREADY
PREPARED, BUT HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE BEING
RAISED BY GAY AND LESBIAN
COUPLES TODAY.
>> Stephen: AND YOUR OPPONENTS
HAVE A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT THAT
WE HAVE TO KEEP CHILDREN AWAY
FROM IDEAS OF SEXUALITY AND
BEING RAISED BY GAY PEOPLE
INTRODUCES THEM TO THE IDEA OF
SEXUALITY TOO EARLY.
ALL RIGHT.
AND I'M ON BOARD.
I THINK THAT WHEN BABIES ARE
BEING BORN, WE HAVE TO BLINDFOLD
THEM SO THEY CAN'T SEE THEIR
MOTHER'S HAVE JAY THAT.
WE HAVE TO KEEP THE KIDS SAFE.
>> AT LEAST THE BOYS.
>> Stephen: EITHER ONE.
HEY, THAT'S HOW YOU GET A
LESBIAN.
OH, NO, THAT'S PROVEN.
( LAUGHTER )
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
>> WELL, THERE ARE SEVERAL
THINGS.
FIRST THE UNITED STATES SUPREME
COURT SAYS IT'S NOT, SAYS THAT
PROCREATION IS NOT THE PURPOSE
OF MARRIAGE.
LIBERTY IS THE PURPOSE OF
MARRIAGE.
>> Stephen: LIBERTY?
THE CONSTITUTION ENSHRINING OUR
LIBERTY.
THIS IS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH SCALIA, FOR
SOMETHING TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL,
THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAVE TO
HAVE INTENDED IT, AND IN THE
18th CENTURY, THERE WERE NO
GAY PEOPLE.
>> ALL OF THE SUPREME COURT, NOT
JUST THE LIBERALS, BUT ALL OF
THE SUPREME COURT, ALL NINE OF
THEM HAVE HELD MARRIAGE IS ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RIGHTS
THAT ANYBODY HAS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: I'M AN
ORIGINALIST.
I'M SORRY.
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT I BELIEVE
THAT MARRIAGE IS TO SETTLE
TRIBAL FEUDS OR TO INCREASE YOUR
LAND HOLDING.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, YOU COULD HAVE TRIBAL
FEUDS AND LAND HOLDINGS AMONG
GAY AND LESBIAN PEOPLE, TOO.
>> YOU'RE REPRESENTING TWO
DIFFERENT COUPLES, A GAY
CUPPING, TWO MEN, AND A LESBIAN
COUPLE, TWO WOMEN WHO WANT TO
GET MARRIED.
>> TO EACH OTHER.
>> Stephen: WHY JUST NOT HAVE
THE MEN MARRY THE WOMEN?
THEN THEY'RE MARRIED AND NO
HARM, NO FOUL.
>> YOU SEE, GROUP MARRIAGES ARE
ILLEGAL, TOO.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S NEXT.
THAT'S NEXT.
IF WE CAN HAVE GAY MARRIAGE, WHY
CAN'T I MARRY A SNAKE?
>> WELL, THAT WOULD BE YOUR
CHOICE, BUT...
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE MY
CHOICE?
WOULD THAT BE MY LIBERTY, SIR IN
DID I JUST BEAT A CONSTITUTIONAL
SCHOLAR?
>> PERHAPS, BUT THE
CONSTITUTION, THE SUPREME COURT
SAYS THAT TWO PEOPLE, NOT FOUR
PEOPLE, NOT THREE PEOPLE, NOT A
PERSON AND A SNAKE, NOT A PERSON
AND A HORSE, TWO PEOPLE HAVE A
RIGHT TO GET MARRIED.
AND THEY'VE HELD THAT FOR
PRISONERS WHO CAN'T EVEN
CONSUMMATE A MARRIAGE.
THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T PROCREATE
BECAUSE THEY SAY THE MARRIAGE
RELATIONSHIP IS SO IMPORTANT TO
HUMAN DIGNITY, HUMAN
RELATIONSHIP, HUMAN FULFILLMENT
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DEPRIVE EVEN
MURDERERS WHO CAN BE LOCKED UP
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES FROM
THE ABILITY TO MARRY SOMEBODY.
>> Stephen: WELL, I FIND IT
OFFENSIVE THAT YOU WOULD CALL
GAY PEOPLE MURDERERS.
EVEN I AM NOT THAT BAD.
MR. BOIES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
HOLD ON A SECOND, SIR.
WE HAVE ANOTHER GUEST.
