(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Dave: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE "REPORT."
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE GENERAL ELECTION HASN'T EVEN OFFICIALLY KICKED OFF BUT TODAY BARACK
OBAMA USED TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO CAMPAIGN IN A KEY SWING STATE-- AFGHANISTAN.
(LAUGHTER) WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THERE FOR SO LONG I BELIEVE THEY NOW GET THREE ELECTORAL VOTES.
(LAUGHTER) OBAMA FIRST ADDRESSED THE TROOPS AT BAGRAM AIR BASE THEN MET WITH
HAMID KARZAI TO SIGN A SECURITY AGREEMENT WHICH LASTS THROUGH 2024.
SO TO THOSE WHO HAD 23 YEARS IN THE AFGHAN WAR POOL-- YOU WIN?
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS WHOLE TRIP IS JUST A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT BY OBAMA TO
REMIND VOTERS THAT HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND MITT ROMNEY IS NOT.
(LAUGHTER) DIDN'T EVEN INVITE HIM.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
OBAMA IS RUNNING SUCH AN UGLY CAMPAIGN, FOLKS, HE IS DETERMINED TO TURN THIS WHOLE
ELECTION INTO SOME SORT OF COMPETITION.
WORST OF ALL, YESTERDAY OBAMA CYNICALLY USED THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ORDERING THE
HIT ON BIN LADEN TO ORDER A HIT ON MITT ROMNEY WITH THIS SLICK CAMPAIGN AD.
FIRST HE USES BILL CLINTON TO PRAISE OBAMA'S JUDGMENT AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THEN POINTS
OUT THAT MITT ROMNEY CRITICIZED OBAMA FOR VOWING TO STRIKE AL QAEDA TARGETS INSIDE PAKISTAN IF NECESSARY.
FINALLY TURNING IT ALL OVER TO OBAMA HATCHET MAN WOLF BLITZER.
>> IT'S NOT WORTH MOVING HEAVEN AND EARTH SPENDING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS JUST TRYING TO CATCH ONE PERSON.
HE WAS REFERRING TO THE HUNT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> Stephen: OKAY, MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN OUT BIN LADEN BUT ROMNEY HAS PROVEN HE
WILL SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REMOVE ANOTHER GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I JUSTEDLY PERSONALLY THAT BOASTING HE KILLED BIN LADEN IS UNPRESIDENTIAL.
I'M NOT ALONE.
>> THIS IS NOT JUST SPIKING THE FOOTBALL, THIS IS SHOVING IT
DOWN THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN'S VOTE.
OBAMA SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO SPIKE THE BALL BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S DOING AN END ZONE DANCE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA BRAGGING ABOUT THE BIN LADEN RAID.
IS THIS SPIKING THE FOOTBALL?
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SPIKING THE BALL.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TAKING ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SPIKE THE BIN LADEN FOOTBALL.
>> HE IS SPIKING THE FOOTBALL.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
(LAUGHTER) PRESIDENTS DON'T SPIKE THE FOOTBALL.
YOU DO AN END ZONE DANCE ON AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER EVEN IF YOU NEVER FOUND THE FOOTBALL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I BELIEVE THAT WAS ABOARD THE U.S.S. "HUMILITY." (LAUGHTER)
EVEN I HAVE TO SAY IN YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN CONFRONTED WITH HIS ATTACK
ON ROMNEY'S RECORD OBAMA DID MAKE A GOOD POINT.
>> I JUST RECOMMEND THAT EVERYBODY TAKE A LOOK AT PEOPLE'S PREVIOUS STATEMENTS IN
TERMS OF WHETHER THEY THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO GO INTO PAKISTAN AND TAKE OUT BIN LADEN.
I ASSUME PEOPLE MEANT WHAT THEY SAID WHEN THEY SAID IT.
THAT'S BEEN AT LEAST MY PRACTICE
>> Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
THE PRESIDENT MEANS WHAT HE SAID.
BUT BE CAREFUL IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HE MI
