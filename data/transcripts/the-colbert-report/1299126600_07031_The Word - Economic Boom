[LAUGHTER]
LAST NIGHT OF NIGHT I TALKED TO YOU ABOU
THE POLITE OF AMERICA'S MIDDLE
CLASS.
TRADITION TRADITIONALLY THEY'VE
COME FROM AMERICA'S INDUSTRIAL
SECTOR BUT LAST YEAR LESS THAN
12 MILLION AMERICANS WORKED IN
MANUFACTURING AND THE UNITED
STATES RAN UP A TRADE DEFICIT OF
$497 BILLION THOUGH I DON'T
COMPLETELY TRUST THE MUST NUMBERS
SINCE ALL OUR CALCULATORS ARE
NOW KNEAD CHINA.
[LAUGHTER]
AMERICA HASN'T HAD A TRADE
SURPLUS SINCE 1975.
WE'VE NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE
COLLAPSE OF OUR DISCO BALL
INDUSTRY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT MAY SHOCK YOU TO LEARN THAT
ONE OF AMERICA'S TOP THREE
EXPORTS IS ZRAP AND TRASH --
SCRAP AND TRASH.
[LAUGHTER]
THOSE AREN'T JUST THE NICKNAMES
OF CHARLIE SHEEN'S LIVE-IN
GIRLFRIENDS.
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
SEEM LIKE LOVELY YOUNG LADIES.
ACTUAL -- I'M TALKING ACTUAL
SCRAP AND TRASH.
THINGS ARE LOOKING BLEAK,
NATION, BUT THERE'S A CLEAR PATH
TO RECOVERY AND IT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ECONOMIC BOOM.
FOLKS WORK HE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO
GET OUR DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THERE'S BEEN
SOME GOOD STARTS.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH
AGREE ON CUTTING USELESS STUFF
LIKE $22 MILLION FROM SPECIAL
EDUCATION.
$103 MILLION FROM FEMA AND $2.5
BILLION FROM HOME HEATING
ASSISTANCE FOR THE POOR.
HEY,S WILL ALMOST -- HEY, IT'S
ALMOST SPRING AND WITH GLOBAL
WARMING THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST
WINTER.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IN THEIR HASTE TO BALANCE
THE BUDGET SOME ARE GOING TOO
FAR.
>> I REALLY AM PLEADING WITH YOU
PLEASE REDUCE SPENDING.
REDUCE IT IN THE DEFENSE BUDGET.
>> THERE'S PLENTY TO CUT WITHIN
THE DEFENSE BUDGET.
>> WE HAVE TO LOOK LONG AND HARD
AT THE MILITARY BUDGET.
>> Stephen: NO.
DEFENSE IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO
GROW OUR WAY OUT OF THIS THING.
A COUNTRY HAS TO SELL WHAT IT'S
GOOD AT.
THAT'S WHY RUSSIA EXPORTS VODKA.
GERMANY EXPORTS CARS AND SWEDEN
EXPORTS CHEAP FURNITURE THAT
BECOMES OR SCRAP AND TRASH.
[LAUGHTER]
WE KNOW AMERICA STILL MAKES
SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD WANTS:
WE --
[LAUGHTER]
-- MAKE WEAPONS.
AND THE WORLD CANNOT WAIT TO GET
ITS FINGERS ON OUR TRIGGERS.
RECENT WEAPONS ARE AN ORDER FROM
THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, A
AIRCRAFT DEAL WITH INDIA AND AN
ARMS PACKAGE WORTH $60 BILLION
INCLUDING APACHE ATTACK
HELICOPTERS AND A FLEET OF
F-15'S TO SAUDI ARABIA.
AND THE BEST PART IS:  THE F-15
IS OBSOLETE.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, OUR MILITARY HAS NOT
BOUGHT A NEW F-15 SINCE 2001.
IT'S LIKE THE SAUDIS GAVE US $60
BILLION FOR A BOATLOAD OF VCR'S.
[LAUGHTER]
AND OUR FIREARM FIRE SALES HAVE
GOTTEN A LOT OF FREE PRESS
LATELY.
>> THE U.S. HAS SOLD BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, FIGHTER JETS, LEADERS,
WEAPONS TO THE EGYPTIAN
MILITARY.
>> AMERICANS ARRANGED FOR
GENERAL DYNAMICS TO SELL
HELICOPTERS TO GO TO MOMAR
QADDAFI.
>> THE LABEL ON THE TEAR GAS
SHOT AT THEM IS MADE IN THE
U.S.A.
>> Stephen: MADE IN THE
U.S.A., BABY.
PRODUCTS BUILT TO LAST.
[LAUGHTER]
KEEP IN MIND, DEFENSE INDUSTRY
PLOYS OVER 600,000 PEOPLE.
THESE ARE AMERICAN JOBS IN
AMERICAN FACTORIES MAKING
AMERICAN INSTRUMENTS OF
DESTRUCTION THAT ARE AS AMERICAN
AS NAPALM PIE.
SO IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE CANNOTzV
CUT DEFENSE BECAUSE DEVELOPING
BUILDING AND SELLING WEAPONS IS
SAY PERPETUAL MONEY-MAKING
MACHINE.
YOU SEE --
[LAUGHTER]
-- WE GIVE THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT BILLIONS TO DEVELOP
NEW WEAPONS TO PROTECT US FROM
POTENTIAL ENEMIES.
A FEW YEARS LATER WE SELL THEM
TO ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING
POTENTIAL ENEMIES.
THEN WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
MANUFACTURE NEWER BETTER WEAPONS
TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM WHAT
WE JUST SOLD.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, THAT REMINDS ME:  THIS
YEAR'S DEFENSE BUDGET WAS ONLY
$725 BILLION.
THAT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.
I HEAR SAUDI ARABIA HAS F-15'S
NOW.
THEY ARE GOING TO USE THEM TO
COME AFTER OUR STRATEGIC RESERVE
OF SCRAP AND TRASH.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, WASHINGTON, GO AHEAD CUT
SPENDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY.
CUT SPENDING FOR MEDICARE.
CUT IT FOR ANYTHING.
JUST LEAVE DEFENSE SPENDING
ALONE BECAUSE WE KNOW IF WE
FOCUS ALL OUR RESOURCES ON
THINGS THAT EXPLODE SO W
