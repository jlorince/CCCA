(LAUGHTER)NATION, THE MID-TERMS ARE ALMOST
HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THE MID-TERMS ARE ALMOST
HERE, AND REMEMBER THEY COUNTFOR 30% OF YOUR GRADE.
AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THEREPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE
KICKING ASS AND TAKING SEATSBECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A MESSAGE
THAT APPEALS TO ALL AMERICANS,IF YOU DON'T COUNT 51% OF THEM.
>> AN EXCLUSIVE REPORT ONPOLITICO STATES A STUDY ORDERED
BY TWO REPUBLICAN GROUPS FOUNDTHAT FEMALE VOTERS FEEL
THE PARTY IS "STUCK IN THEPAST."
THEY ALSO SAID THE G.O.P. WASINTOLERANT AND LACKED
COMPASSION.
NEARLY 50% OF WOMEN HAD ANUNFAVORABLE VIEW OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS INWORSE SHAPE WITH WOMEN NOW THAN
IT WAS IN 2010.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
>> I'M NOT SURE.
IN SPITE OF ALL THIS CHATTER,WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT
YEAR.
>> Stephen: YEP, GREAT YEAR.
SUPER GOOD.
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU WITH ALL THECHATTER ABOUT HOW WOMEN HATE US.
OKAY, SO REPUBLICANS ARE HAVINGSOME LADY PROBLEMS.
AND THEY CAN'T FIX THEM THE WAYYOU NORMALLY DO, BY DRINKING
ALONE IN THE DEN WITH BILLYJOEL'S "BIG SHOT" CRANKED ALL
THE WAY UP.
(SINGING)NOW YOU HAD TO BE A BIG SHOT,
DIDN'T YA!
YOU HAD TO PROVE IT TO THECROWD!
YOU HAD TO BE A BIG SHOT, DIDN'TYA!
OH YOUR FRIENDS WERE SO KNOCKEDOUT.
(APPLAUSE)YOU HAD TO HAVE THE LAST WORD
LAST NIGHT, SO YOU KNOW WHATEVERYTHING'S ABOUT.
YOU HAD TO HAVE THE WHITE HOTSPOTLIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, BECAUSE NONE OF THIS IS
GOING TO MAKE IT INTO THESHOW --
(AUDIENCE REACTS)-- BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR THE
G.O.P.
IN THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OFSTEPHEN COLBERT'S "MID TERM
ROUNDUP."

THANK YOU, STEVE!
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.NOW FIRST UP,
I'M A LONG-TIME FAN OFOF FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR

TRUCK SINCE SENATOROPTIMUS PRIME.

MASSACHUSETTS.

AGAINST INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT ANDDR. SEUSS TRIBUTE NAME
JEANNE SHAHEEN.
UNFORTUNATELY, BROWN IS LOSINGTHE WOMEN VOTE TO SHAHEEN BY 39
TO 53%.
HAVEN'T THE LADIES OFNEW HAMPSHIRE SEEN HIS OLD COSMO

BROWN COMMEMORATED THE OCCASIONIN A PRESS RELEASE, SAYING --
I'M PLEASED TO AWARD JANICE WITHA HERO AWARD TO CELEBRATE HER
DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN ABUSINESS DESPITE GOVERNMENT RED
TAPE AND BURDENSOMEREGULATIONS...
IT IS VERY TROUBLING TO LISTENTO JANET'S STORY.
THE MOST TROUBLING THING ABOUTJANET'S STORY?
HER NAME IS JANICE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THAT, THAT IS NOT
SCOTT BROWN'S FAULT.
I MEAN, HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TOREMEMBER HER NAME?
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WENT TO THETROUBLE TO PUT IT ON THE PLAQUE.
I MEAN, THAT'S AN EXTRA 2 CENTSA LETTER.
JANE HERE WAS CLEARLY MOVED BYTHE HONOR.
AS SHE TOLD TIME MAGAZINE, SHEWAS LEFT CONFUSED AND
EMBARRASSED BY THE WHOLEEPISODE, BUT I'M SURE THAT
JANINE WILL REMEMBER THIS GREATHONOR COME ELECTION DAY.

WE CANNOT HAVE BURDENSOMEREGULATIONS ON SMALL BUSINESS.
