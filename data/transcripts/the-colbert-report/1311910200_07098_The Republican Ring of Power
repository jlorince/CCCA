( APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WOW, WELCOME TO
THE REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
I GOT TO TELL YOU--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I TELL YOU, FOLKS, I-- I
LOVE THAT SO MUCH.
I COULD HEAR IT TWICE A
NIGHT.
NATION, THE DEBT CEILING
DEBATE DRAGS ON AND ON AND
FRANKLY BOTH PARTIES HAVE
BEEN ACTING LIKE CHILDREN.
WITH THE REPUBLICANS SAYING
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME AND THE
DEMOCRATS SAYING TAKE IT,
TAKE IT, TAKE IT, JUST DON'T
HIT ME IT IS CAUSING
PROBLEMS FOR BOTH PARTIES.
YESTERDAY JOHN McCAIN ATTACK
THE TEA PARTY FOR THEIR
NAIVETE.
>> THE IDEA SEEMS TO BE THAT
IF A HOUSE GOP REFUSES TO
RAISE THE DEBT CEILING A
DEFAULT CRISIS OR GRADUAL
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WILL
ENSUE AND THE PUBLIC WILL
TURN EN MASSE AGAINST BARACK
OBAMA AND THE TEA PARTY
HOBBITS COULD RETURN TO
MIDDLE EARTH HAVING DEFEATED
MORDOR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THEN-- THEN MARK
MECKLER OF THE TEA PARTY
PATRIOTS SAID OF McCAIN
CLEARLY McCAIN HAS BEEN
CORRUPTED BY THE RING OF
POWER.
I GOT TO SAY--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I HAVE GOT TO SAY I AM
DISAPPOINTED.
THIS IS A MONUMENTAL ISSUE
THAT COULD AFFECT THE
ECONOMY FOR A GENERATION OF
AMERICANS.
FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE COUNTRY
COULD DEFAULT AND THESE
CLOWNS IN WASHINGTON ARE
USING THE LORD OF THE RINGS
TO SAY THAT JOHN McCAIN IS
SAURON, THAT IS RIDICULOUS,
McCAIN IS CLEARLY SARU MANN.
THERE HE IS.
LOOK, HE LIGHTS UP.
HE LIGHTS UP S THAT NOT
AWESOME?
OKAY, NOW YOU SEE, SARUMAN
IS IN LEAGUE WITH SAURON
BACK HERE, ALL RIGHT.
HE'S IN LEAGUE WITH SAURON
WHO IS ACTUALLY OBAMA, OKAY.
AND THE HOBBIT, THE HOBBITS
AREN'T THE TEA PARTY, THE
HOBBITS ARE CANTOR-- KANTOR
AND BOEHNER, OKAY, AND LET'S
SAY LIEBERMAN JUST ON
APPEARANCES.
AND GANDALF IS THE TEA PARTY
RIGHT HERE, OKAY.
YOU SHALL NOT PASS
LEGISLATION RAISING THE DEBT
CEILING!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND THEN McCAIN IS ALL-- ,-- THE
CAVE TROLL IS, I DON'T FOE
BUT IT'S AWESOME.
LET'S SAY NANCY PELOSI, I
DON'T KNOW.
AND OH, I ALSO HAVE A
PINBALL MACHINE OVER THERE,
LORD OF THE RINGS PINBALL
MACHINE.
IT'S A LIMITED EDITION AND
THAT IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
REALLY FUN, OH, ONE MORE
THING.
AND THIS, OF COURSE, IS
ARAGON'S SWORD ANDURIL,
FLAME GIVEN TO ME ABOUT
VIGGO MORTENSEN.
NOW THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE METAPHOR.
I JUST WANT TO REMIND
EVERYONE THAT I HAVE THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
AND OF COURSE, OF COURSE I
WOULD BE-- THE POINT IS I
GET COMPARING THE DEBT
CRISIS TO THE LORD OF THE
RINGS.
THEY BOTH HAVE ELABORATE
PLOTS, MORE CHARACTERS THAN
YOU CAN KEEP TRACK OF, AND
TALKING ABOUT BOTH OF THEM
REPELS GIRLS.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, STAY
