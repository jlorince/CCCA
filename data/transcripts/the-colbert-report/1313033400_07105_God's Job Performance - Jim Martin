WHY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND, FOLKS, ASKING ABOUT GOD'S
JOB PERFORMANCE RAISES AN EVEN
MORE TROUBLING QUESTION?
WHAT IS GOD'S JOB?  OF COURSE,
THAT IS ULTIMATELY AN
UNANSWERABLE QUESTION.
HERE TO ANSWER IT, PLEASE
WELCOME THE OFFICIAL CHAPLAIN OF
THE COLBERT NATION, FATHER JIM
MARTIN.
PAPA J!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW I HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT
HERE.
AS THE AUTHOR OF THE JESUIT
GUIDE TO ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS
QUESTION.
WHAT IS GOD'S JOB?
>> SUSTAINING THE UNIVERSE.
>> STEPHEN: CAN WE JUDGE HIM?
>> NO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING BY.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY CAN'T WE JUDGE GOD?
HE GIVE US CRITICAL FACULTY, HE
MADE US VERY DISSATISFIED.
WHY CAN'T WE, YOU KNOW PUT THE
SANDAL ON THE OTHER FOOT AND
SAY, YOU NO HE WHAT LET'S HAVE A
LITTLE QUALITY CONTROL HERE.
WE'LL GIVE YOU FEEDBACK AND
MAYBE HE COULD CHANGE THE WAY HE
BEHAVES?
>> I THINK WE COULD TRY TO
UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE AND
GOD'S WAYS.
ULTIMATELY IT'S MYSTERIOUS AND
PARTICULARLY THE THINGS YOU
POINTED OUT, FAMINES, FLOODS,
NATURAL DISASTERS, THESE THINGS
HAVE CONFOUNDED THEOLOGIANS AND
SAINTS FOR YEARS.
THE QUESTION OF WHY GOD ALLOWS
THINKS THINGS TO HAPPEN --
THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WE
WON'T BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE
QUESTION OF WHY HE ALLOWS THESE
THINGS TO HAPPEN.
>> STEPHEN: WHY DO YOU THINK
HIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE SO LOW
RIGHT NOW?
ISN'T THAT KIND OF THE FAULT OF
GUYS LIKE YOU?
AREN'T YOU KIND OF GOD'S PR TEAM
AND HAVEN'T YOU DROPPED THE
BALL?
[LAUGHTER]
NOT TO JUDGE.
>> I THINK FREQUENTLY WHEN
PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT GOD'S
PERFORMANCE RATING AND WHAT THEY
THINK ABOUT GOD THEY ARE
THINKING OF HOW THINGS ARE IN
THEIR LIVES.
>> STEPHEN: RIGHT.
I'M NOT HAPPY AT ALL TIMES.
[LAUGHTER]
EVERYTHING IS NOT WORKING OUT
PERFECTLY FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE
A CHRISTIAN AND I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE, YOU LOOK AT JESUS AND
THINGS DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT
WELL FOR ME EITHER.
>> STEPHEN: BUT HE KNEW THEY
WOULD EVENTUALLY.
>> AND WE KNOW THEY WILL FOR US
IN THE AFTERLIFE.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DO I KNOW
THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU TRUST IN WHAT JESUS SAYS.
THE WAY I LIKE TO EXPLAIN IT TO
PEOPLE IN TERMS OF AFTERLIFE AND
COMING TO UNDERSTAND OUR PLACE
IN THE UNIVERSE, GOD WOULD NEVER
DESTROY A RELATIONSHIP HE
CREATED.
THE RELATIONSHIP GOD HAD WITH
YOU IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
TO ENDURE FOREVER.
WE HOPE WE GET A CHANCE TO ASK
GOD SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS.
>> STEPHEN: IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP GOD GET
BETTER RATINGS RIGHT NOW?
I HAVE A SUPERPAC, COULD THAT
HELP IN ANY WAY?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I WOULD SAY THAT BY BEING --
I WOULD SAY PEOPLE BE MORE
GRATEFUL.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IF THINGS
ARE, IF YOU PARDON MY LATIN
(BLEEP).
DO I HAVE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE
(BLEEP) PARTS, TOO.
I THINK PART OF RELATIONSHIP TO
GOD IS BEING HONEST ABOUT THE
(BLEEP) PARTS.
BUT ALSO.
>> STEPHEN: I FIND THAT
OFFENSIVE COMING FROM A MAN OF
THE CLOTH.
EXCUSE ME.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE NO STANDARDS.
I HAVE NO STANDARDS BUT FROM THE
CHAPLAIN OF THE COLBERT NATION.
>> TRYING TO SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
RELATING TO THE YOUNG.
>> BEING HONEST IN YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD BUT BEING
HONEST ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE
GOD.
PEOPLE COME TO GOD ONLY WHEN
THEY ARE READY TO COMPLAIN OR
LAMENT SOMETHING RATHER THAN
CELEBRATING THINGS OR GIVING
PRAISE TO GOD.
>> STEPHEN: LIKE THE FACT I
EXIST.
>> IT'S SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.
>> STEPHEN: CAN WE TALK
POLITICS FOR A SECOND CSM GOD
GET THE UPPER HAND IN THE POLLS
BY GOING NEGATIVE ON ONE OF HIS
OPPONENTS?
LIKE RUNNING AN AD AGAINST BUDA.
FATSO WANTS YOU TO HAVE
NOTHINGNESS.
YAHWEH WANTS TO YOU HAVE
EVERYTHINGNESS.
VOTE YAHWEH.
>> I'LL TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
FATHER JIM MARTIN.
THIS GUY NEEDS TO BE A
MONSIGNOR.
THE BOOK IS THE JESUIT GUIDE TO
ALMOST EVERYTHING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
