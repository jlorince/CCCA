>> Colbert: TONIGHT!
HEY, LOOK, BEFORE WE BEGIN, I
JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO
TALK ABOUT THE ATTACK IN BOSTON
YESTERDAY.
OBVIOUSLY OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR
PRAYERS ARE WITH EVERYBODY
THERE.
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T
KNOW WHO DID THIS, BUT THEY WILL
BE FOUND AND THEY WILL BE
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.
BUT WHOEVER DID THIS OBVIOUSLY
DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE
PEOPLE OF BOSTON BECAUSE NOTHING
THESE TERRORISTS DO IS GOING TO
SHAKE THEM.
FOR PETE'S SAKE, BOSTON WAS
FOUNDED BY THE PILGRIMS -- A
PEOPLE SO TOUGH THEY HAD TO
BUCKLED THEIR GOD-DAMNED HATS
ON.
IT IS THE CRADLATE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION, A CITY THAT
WITHSTOOD AN 86-YEAR LOSING
STREAK, A CITY THAT MADE IT
THROUGH THE BIG DIG, A
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT BACKED
UP TRAFFIC FOR 16 YEARS.
I MEAN, THERE ARE COMMUTER JUST
GETTING HOME NOW.
EVEN THEIR BANDS ARE TOUGH.
IT'S THE HOMETOWN OF AEROSMITH
WHO IN THEIR FIFTH DECADE ARE
STILL GOING STRONG EVEN STEVEN
TYLER LOOKS FANTASTIC, FOR A
73-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.
BUT HERE'S WHAT THESE COWARDS
REALLY DON'T GET.
THEY ATTACKED THE BOSTON
MARATHON, AN EVENT CELEBRATING
PEOPLE WHO RUN 26 MILES ON THEIR
DAY OFF UNTIL THEIR NIPPLES ARE
RAW... FOR FUN.
AND THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING IT IN
BOSTON SINCE 1897.
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH YOU
HAVE TO BE TO RUN IN A WHALE
BONE CORSET?
AND WHEN THOSE BOMBS WENT OFF,
THERE WERE RUNNERS WHO, AFTER
FINISHING A MARATHON, KEPT
RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TWO MILES TO
THE HOSPITAL TO DONATE BLOOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.
THESE MANIACS MAY HAVE TRIED TO
MAKE LIFE BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF
BOSTON, BUT ALL THEY CAN EVER DO
IS SHOW JUST HOW GOOD THOSE
PEOPLE ARE.
