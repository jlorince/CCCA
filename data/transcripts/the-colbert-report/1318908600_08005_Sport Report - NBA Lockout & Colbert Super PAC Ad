>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, THANK YOU.
NATION, FOLKS, THEY SAY IT'S
NOT WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE,
IT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME.
THAT'S WHY I PLAY EVERY
SPORT WITH A BASEBALL BAT.
THE OTHER BOXER NEVER SEES
IT COMING.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, FIRST UP, THE WORLD
SERIES.
THERE WILL BE ONE.
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR THE NBA SEASON.
JIM.
>> OWNERS AND PLAYERS ARE
DEADLOCKED IN A LABOR
DISPUTE THAT FAILED TO MEET
A DEADLINE MONDAY.
THE NBA'S FIRST TWO WEEKS OF
GAMES HAVE NOW BEEN
CANCELLED.
>> COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN
SAID TODAY HIS GUT FEELING
IS THAT THEY WON'T BE
PLAYING BASKETBALL ON
CHRISTMAS DAY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
BASKETBALL ON CHRISTMAS IS A
TRADITION DATING BACK TO THE
BIRTH OF CHRIST.
WHEN THE WISEMEN FOUND THE
BABE IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
AND SHOT HIM OUT OF A
T-SHIRT CANON.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DO NOT
SEE EYE-TO-EYE WITH THE
PLAYERS.
IN FACT, I BARELY SEE EYE TO
GROIN.
THESE SELFISH HOOP STERS,
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
THEY ARE ALREADY MAKING
PLANS WHAT THEY WILL DO ONCE
THEY HAVE RUINED THE SEASON,
FROM KOBE BRYANT PLAYING AN
EXHI BUSINESS GAME IN ITALY
TO LA BRON JAMES ASKING
ABOUT THE NFL'S FREE AGENT
DEADLINE, TO SIXERS FORWARD
ANDRE IGUADALA SPENDING A
WEEK AS AN INTERN AT MERRILL
LYNCH.
I BELIEVE HIS DUTIES
CONSISTED MOSTLY OF 360
TOMAHAWK PHOTOCOPYING.
I WILL TELL YOU WHO THE REAL
VICTIMS ARE.
THE NBA OWNERS.
LIKE MY CLOSE PERSONAL
FRIEND DALLAS MAVERICK'S
OWNER MARK CUBAN.
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO COMMENT
ON THE LOCKOUT.
AS HE MADE CLEAR ON MY SHOW.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
LOCKOUT.
>> OKAY.
>> OKAY.
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN
THE LOCKOUT.
>> I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE
LOCKOUT-- LOCKOUT.
>> Stephen: YOU JUST
WITNESSED HISTORY, FOLKS.
THE FIRST TIME MARK CUBAN
HAS KEPT A THOUGHT TO
HIMSELF.
WELL, MR. CUBAN--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MR. CUBAN MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT
THE LOCKOUT BUT MR. COLBERT
SUPERPAC CAN.
LAST WEEK-- LAST WEEK WE
BOUGHT AIR TIME ON DALLAS
WFAA CHANNEL 8 NEWS, TO AIR
OUR NEW PAC AD.
JIMMY, MAKE THE DYNAMITE GO
BOOM.
>> IT'S ANOTHER SAD DAY IN
AMERICA AS THE NBA LOCKOUT
GRINDS ON, DEPRIVING
MILLIONS OF THEIR FAVORITE
SPORT.
MEANWHILE, THE NBA PLAYERS
WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET
ALL --
>> THE UNEMPLOYMENT AT AN
ALL-TIME HIGH, THE PLAYERS
ARE DEMANDING MORE MILLIONS.
BUT THE NBA OWNERS ARE ON
YOUR SIDE.
THEY'RE WORKING HARD TO SAVE
THE SEASON.
SO AMERICANS DON'T HAVE TO
WATCH HOCKEY.
NBA OWNERS ARE JOB CREATORS
WHO SEND OUR ECONOMY SOARING,
LIKE THESE THINGS.
AND HEROES LIKE MARK KINDAN
ARE THE NUMBER ONE EMPLOYER
OF OUR NATION'S TINY BLIMP
PILOTS.
THE PLAYERS HAVE MISSED
THEIR JOB.
SO DAHL YOUR-- CALL YOUR
LOCAL SPORTS RADIO SHOW AND
YELL.
WE WANT OUR NBA.
>> AMERICANS-- RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CONTENT OF THIS
ADVERTISING, MADE POSSIBLE
FROM A GENEROUS DONATION
FROM COLBERT SUPERPAC.
>> Stephen: HA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, STOP.
A POWERFUL AD SURE TO BRING
THIS CRISIS TO AN END.
EXCEPT FOR ONE MINOR DETAIL,
WFAA DID NOT RUN OUR AD.
BOO!
>> Stephen: I DO NOT HAVE
MOANED THAT BETTER.
WELL, ARE WFAA, YOU HAVE
[BLEEP] THE WRONG PEOPLE.
WE ARE COLBERT SUPERPAC AND
OUR RAGE TONIGHT IS BIG AND
BRIGHT.
>> DEEP IN THE HEART OF
TEXAS!
>> Stephen: NICE.
OH, AND WHAT IS WFAA'S
EXCUSE?
ACCORDING TO THE LETTER I
RECEIVED FROM THEIR SALES
MANAGER, QUOTE, HERE'S AN
EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED,
I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY IF
HAPPENED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I CAN.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SILENCE
YOU, NATION.
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT.
>> NO!
>> Stephen: WFAA, I CALL ON
YOU TO AIR OUR AD TOMORROW
ON A PRIME SPOT LIKE GOOD
MORNING AMERICA, IT WILL BE
A DOSE OF HARD TRUTH BETWEEN
SEGMENTS ON KEEPING YOUR PET
HAPPY AND COCKTAILS INSPIRED
BY DANCING WITH THE STARS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BECAUSE FOLKS,
THIS RIGHT HERE IS CLEARLY
AN ELABORATE, NEFARIOUS
CONSPIRACY BY WFF-- WFAA,
UNLESS!
THIS IS REALLY AN ELABORATE
NEFARIOUS CONSPIRACY BY ME!
(LAUGHTER)
THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS.
PUT IT TOGETHER.
MARK CUBAN COMES ON MY SHOW
THE SAME NIGHT MY SUPERPAC
GETS AN ANONYMOUS DONOR.
THEN SUDDENLY MY SUPERPAC
MAKES A TV COMMERCIAL ABOUT
THE NBA LOCKOUT.
THAT, WERE CUBAN PAYING FOR
THE AD, WOULD VIOLATE NBA
COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN'S
GAG ORDER AND REMEMBER,
THAT'S A BASKETBALL GAG.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE QUESTION IS, THE
QUESTION IS WHAT DID I KNOW
AND WHEN DID I KNOW IT?
AND WILL DAVID STERN FIND
MARK CUBAN.
WELL, FOLKS, IT'S ONLY ONE
GROUP THAT CAN GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS.
THE CRACK NEWS TEAM OF WFAA.
I'M TALKING ABOUT ANCHOR RON
CORNING, GREG FIELDS ON
WEATHER AND ALEXA CONOMOS ON
TRAFFIC.
CHANNEL 8, DALLAS NEWS

AWARDS, TWO EDWARD R. MURROW
