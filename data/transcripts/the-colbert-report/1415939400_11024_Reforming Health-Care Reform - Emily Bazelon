( LAUGHTER )NOW, FOLKS, OF COURSE, THERE IS
A VERY GOOD REASON MILLIONS OFPEOPLE MAY LOSE THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE.
CLUMSY SEMANTICS.
YOU SEE, IN THE CASE "KING V.BURWELL"
THE PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT SINCETHE EXACT WORDS OF THE
LAW SAY SUBSIDIES ARE INTENDEDFOR THOSE WHO ARE "ENROLLED IN
THROUGH AN EXCHANGE ESTABLISHEDBY THE STATE, SUBSIDIES CANNOT
BE AVAILABLE ON THEhealthcare.gov EXCHANGE."
SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A FEWSLOPPY, ILL-CONSIDERED WORDS,
AND FOR ONCE, THEY'RE NOT JOEBIDEN'S.
SO BOTTOM LINE, THIS LAW ISDEAD, AND I WILL BROOK NO
DISSENT ON THE ISSUE.
HERE TO FORD MY BROOK IS THE"COLBERT REPORT" SENIOR
LEGAL ANALYST AND PERSONACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE, EMILYBAZELON. EMILY, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR BEING BACK. GOOD TO SEEYOU AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT, EMILY, IS THIS ADEATH KNELL FOR OBAMACARE?
>> NO, IT SHOULD NOT BE BECAUSE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS WHENYOU READ THE 900-PAGE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT AS A WHOLE, THE WORDSYOU SINGLED OUT NEED TO BE READ
IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALLOWSUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ENROLL
IN THE FEDERALLY CREATEDEXCHANGES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BUT I DIDN'TSINGLE IT OUT.
THE CASE SINGLED IT OUT.
THE SUPREME COURT IS HEARING THECASE.
THEY MUST THINK THEY'RE PRETTYIMPORTANT WORDS.
THE WORDS SAY, "THROUGH ASTATE," OK?
A STATE IS NOT FEDERALGOVERNMENT, RIGHT?
>> A STATE IS NOT THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THANK YOUFOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DID I JUST WIN? DID I JUST WIN?
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T WIN, BECAUSETHE IRS IS THE AGENCY WHO HAS
THE POWER TO INTERPRET THE LAWUPON.
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAVORITEAGENCY --
>> Stephen:  IT'S NO ONE'SFAVORITE AGENCY.
>> IT'S STILL THE I.R.S.' JOB,AND THE I.R.S. SAYS WE'RE
READING THIS LAW AS A WHOLECOHERENTLY.
IN CONTEXT, IT IS CLEAR THATSTATE EXCHANGES SET UP BY THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-- THEY'RESTILL STATE EXCHANGES-- CAN
STILL GIVE PEOPLE THESESUBSIDIES.
COURTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DEFER TOAGENCIES, THE I.R.S.' READING OF
THE LAW, NOT MAKE IT UPTHEMSELVES.
>> Stephen: SO LET'S JUSTIMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT THE
WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARDYOU'RE DOING WILL NOT WORK.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: AND THEY RULE INFAVOR
OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU CAN'TGET MONEY THROUGH THE FEDERAL
EXCHANGES.
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LAW THEN?
>> THE LAW COULD GO INTO A DEATHSPIRAL, AS YOU WERE SAYING
BEFORE, BECAUSE MILLIONS OFPEOPLE SIGNED UP THROUGH
FEDERALLY RUN EXCHANGES ARERECEIVING SUBSIDIES.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREREQUIRED TO SIGN UP FOR HEALTH
INSURANCE, WANT HEALTHINSURANCE, PRESUMABLY, BUT THEY
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT ONTHEIR OWN.
SO THE SUPREME COURT WOULD BESTRIPPING FROM THEM ALL THE
MONEY ALLOWING THESE MILLIONS OFPEOPLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE,
EFFECTIVELY TAKING HEALTH CAREFROM MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BUT DOESN'T THATREFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE?
BECAUSE LAST TUESDAY, THEAMERICAN PEOPLE VOTED, AND THEY
SAID WITH A SINGLE VOICE, NOHEALTH CARE, THANKS.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WELL, NO, NO, BECAUSECONGRESS DID PASS OBAMACARE.
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER NOW, BUTCONGRESS --
>> Stephen:  I DON'T,ACTUALLY.
I DON'T, ACTUALLY.
>> CONGRESS PASSED OBAMACARE.
AND WHILE THE PAST CONGRESSTRIED --
>> Stephen: BUT WE DON'T KNOWWHAT THEY MEANT.
IF ONLY THOSE PEOPLE WERE STILLALIVE TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY
MEANT.
>> BUT WE DO HAVE THOSE PEOPLEAND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM
HAVE SAID THEY INTENDED TORESTRICT SUBSIDIES TO STATE-RUN
EXCHANGES.
THEY ALL SAY NO.
EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO GETTHESE SUBSIDIES.
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO VOTEDFOR THAT LAW.
>> Stephen: WILL THAT HAVEANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SUPREME
COURT'S RULING ON THIS?
>> WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHERCONGRESSIONAL INTENT, THIS IDEA
OF LOOKING AT WHAT LEGISLATORSWERE TRYING TO DO, HAS ANY
WEIGHT WITH THE JUSTICES.
>> Stephen: SOTOMAYOR ANDKAGAN AND BREYER, ALL THOSE
GUYS, THEY-- ALL THE LIBERALJUSTICES, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER,THEY HAVE BEEN SICK,
SO SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO RECUSETHEMSELVES?
>> YOU THINK THEY'RE THE ONLYONES WHO HAVE BEEN SICK?
>> Stephen: SCALIA HAS NEVERBEEN SICK A DAY IN HIS LIFE.
NO, YOU EAT THAT MUCHPROSCIUTTO, NOTHING CAN LIVE
INSIDE OF YOU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SO WHAT HAPPENS? SO IF THEY RULEAGAINST THE OBAMACARE THING
OBAMACARE THING, IF THE FEDERAL
EXCHANGES AREN'T ABLE TO GIVEANY MONEY, IS THERE ANYTHING
THEY CAN DO AFTER THAT?
CAN THE SUPPORTERS OF OBAMACAREAPPEAL TO THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OR
THE LEGION OF DOOM OR THEAVENGERS OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
>> THEY COULD APPEAL TOCONGRESS.
CONGRESS COULD FIX THIS VERYEASILY.
BUT DO YOU THINK CONGRESS ISREALLY GOING TO DO THAT?
>> Stephen: NO.
EMILY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING ME.
EMILY BAZELON, THE "NEW YORKTIMES" MAGAZINE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.
