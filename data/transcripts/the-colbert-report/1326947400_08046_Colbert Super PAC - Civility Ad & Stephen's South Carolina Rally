>> WILL DO.
>> Stephen: THANKS.
GOOD.
BECAUSE, FOLKS, THE SOUTH
CAROLINA G.O.P. PRIMARY IS
ALREADY NASTY ENOUGH.
AND I BELIEVE SOUTH CAROLINIANS
WANT A POSITIVE RACE.
FOLKS, I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE
DEFINITELY-NOT-COORDINATED WITH
STEPHEN COLBERT SUPERBACK OWNED
BY JON STEWART AGREES.
LAST NIGHT THEY RELEASED THIS AD
PLEADING FOR CIVILITY.
>> YOU CAN'T TURN ON THE TV
THESE DAYS WITHOUT SEEING SOME
NEGATIVE ATTACK AD, A SUPER PAC
SUPPORTING MITT ROMNEY FLOODED
IOWA WITH COMMERCIALS HAMMERING
NEWT GINGRICH.
NEWTON SAID, HE WANTED IT TO
END.
SO THE SUPER PAC BACKING HIM
JUST DUMPED MILLIONS INTO ADS
ATTACKING ROMNEY.
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU SICK.
[THROWING UP]
AMERICANS FOR A BETTER
TOMORROW TOMORROW KNOWS WE
DESERVE BETTER.
DONATE TODAY.
AN WE'LL DESTROY BOTH THESE GUYS
AND THEIR SUPER PACS WITH THE
MERCILESSED A TORRENT SO FIERCE
THEY'D WISH THEY'D NEVER BEEN
INCORPORATED.
WE'LL LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AMERICANS FOR A BETTER
TOMORROW TOMORROW WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF
THIS ADVERTISEMENT.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: POWERFUL STUFF.
BY THE WAY, FOLKS, THAT SAUSAGE
IS MADE OF JON HUNTSMAN.
OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE
CANDIDATE OUT THERE WHO HAS NOT
RUN A SINGLE NEGATIVE AD, HERMAN
CAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
A MAN WHO SHARES MY VALUES.
THAT'S WHY I'VE SAID THAT A VOTE
FOR CAIN IN THIS SATURDAY'S
PRIMARY WOULD BE A STRONG
MESSAGE TO ME THAT VOTERS WANT
ME TO RUN.
OF COURSE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
OF COURSE, NATION, IF YOU WANT
TO GIVE ME THAT MESSAGE
DIRECTLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
FRIDAY I WILL BE IN CHARLESTON,
SOUTH CAROLINA, AT THE ROCK ME
LIKE A HERMAN CAIN SOUTH
CAROLINA RALLY WITH SPECIAL
GUEST HERMAN CAIN.
THIS IS REAL.
IT'S HAPPENING.
FRIDAY AT 1:00 P.M. AT THE
CISTERN AT THE COLLEGE OF
CHARLESTON AT GEORGE STREET,
GATES OPEN AT NOON.
THERE WILL BE SPEECHES.
THERE WILL BE CHEERLEADERS.
THERE WILL BE A MARCHING BAND
AND A GOSPEL CHOIR.
THIS IS GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER
THAN MY RALLY IN D.C.
FOR STARTERS, JON STEWART WON'T
BE THERE.
AND I PROMISE NOT TO WEAR
SOMETHING THAT SHOWS OFF SO MUCH
OF MY SWING VOTERS.
