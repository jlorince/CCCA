BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE MAKING A HUGE PUSH, FOLKS, BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO ONE THING,.
>> IS IT ALL GOING TO BE ABOUT VOTER TURNOUT.
>> YES, HERE AND IN MOST OF THE OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATE.
>> VOTER TURNOUT IS GOING TO MEAN EVERYTHING.
>> IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TURNOUT IN THESE FINAL HOURS.
>> IT REALLY ALL BOILS DOWN TO HOW MANY VOTERS TURN OUT.
>> Stephen: THERE IS A LOT OF TECHNICAL JARGON IN THERE.
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOUR.
THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS MORE VOTERS IS GOING TO WIN.
(LAUGHTER) THAT IS THE BEST ANALYSIS CABLE NEWS HAS DONE SINCE THE 6 PART CNN SERIES BEARS,
DO THEY [BLEEP] IN THE WOODS.
(APPLAUSE) TURNS OUT, TURN OUT-- TURN OUT THE VOTE IS PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL FOR OBAMA BECAUSE
WHILE POLLS SHOW HIM AHEAD OF MITT ROMNEY AMONG REGISTERED VOTERS, AMONG LIKELY VOTERS THEY'RE TIED.
ALTHOUGH AMONG UNLIKELY VOTERS THEY'RE BOTH BEING BEATEN BY A HONEY BOO BOO MARATHON.
NOW OT BAMA CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO GET THOSE REGISTERED VOTERS TO BECOME LIKELY VOTERS.
AND FOLKS, THEY HAVE A SECRET WEAPON TO DO IT.
ACCORDING TO A "THE NEW YORKER" ARTICLE ON THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN, THE BEST WAY TO MOBILIZE VOTERS, THEY
DISCOVERED, IS THROUGH SHAME.
SOMETHING CATHOLICS HAVE KNOWN FOR CENTURIES.
THAT'S WHY JESUS KEEPS GETTING RE-ELECTED.
A 2006 STUDY FOUND THAT GET OUT THE VOTE FLIERS USING SHAME AND GUILT INCREASED
TURNOUT BY AS MUCH AS 8 POINTS.
SO THE CAMPAIGNS ARE USING DATA MINING TO LEARN EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SHAME MARCH TO YOU THE POLLS.
FOR INSTANCE THEY KNOW WHETHER VOTERS HAVE VISITED PORNOGRAPHY WEB SITES, HAVE HOMES IN FORECLOSURE, ARE
MORE PRONE TO DRINK MICHELOB ULTRA THAN CORE ONO OR HAVE GAY FRIENDS OR ENJOY EXPENSIVE VACATIONS.
I MEAN THEY COULD SHAME YOU INTO VOTING BY THREATENING TO REVEAL THAT YOU AND YOUR
GAY FRIENDS WATCH PORN TOGETHER ON EXPENSIVE VACATIONS.
(LAUGHTER) OR EVEN WORSE, THAT YOU DRINK MICHELOB
