MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY GUEST
TONIGHT WANTS TO GIVE LAPTOP
COMPUTERS TO CHILDREN THIS
THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES.
FINE, RIGHT AFTER THEY FINISH
MAKING OUR LAPTOPS.
PLEASE WELCOME NICHOLAS
NEGROPONTE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MR. NEGROPONTE, PLEASURE TO
MEET YOU.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
NOW, YOUR NEW PROJECT, YOU WERE
CO-FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF THE
M.I.T. MEDIA LAB?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: SUPER BRAINY NERD
TOWN INSTITUTION.
RIGHT?
>> IT'S MADE FOR ARTISTS AND
SCIENTISTS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
IS THERE LIKE A SAND PIT?
>> YEP.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ON LEAVE
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NEW
MISSION.
IT'S CALLED ONE LAPTOP PER
CHILD.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: LET'S SHOW THE
PEOPLE.
THIS IS THE LAPTOP RIGHT HERE.
IT'S A SMALL LAPTOP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THESE?
>> WE'RE GIVING IT TO THE
POOREST AND MOST REMOTE CHILDREN
IN THE WORLD.
TOO AFGHANISTAN, ETHIOPIA,
MONGOLIA.
>> Stephen: WHY DO KIDS IN
MONGOLIA NEED TO GET ON
FACEBOOK?
>> THEY WANT TO GET ON FACEBOOK
IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE TO THE
REST OF THE WORLD AND HAVE
ACCESS TO ALL THE THINGS THAT
OUR KIDS HAVE, BE ABLE TO BE ON
THE INTERNET TO LEARN.
WHAT THIS ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO
BASICALLY DRIVE THEIR OWN
LEARNING BECAUSE SCHOOLS... LET
ME TAKE AFGHANISTAN.
25% OF THE TEACHERS ARE
ILLITERATE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> 50% OF KIDS DON'T GO TO
SCHOOL.
75% OF GIRLS DON'T GO TO SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: IS THE COMPUTER
ITSELF THE TEACHER?
>> IT IS THE VEHICLE THROUGH
WHICH THE CHILD LEARN, AND, YES,
IT HELPS CHILDREN TEACH OTHER
CHILDREN.
SO THIS IS A WAY TO LEARN
WITHOUT BUILDING ALL THE
SCHOOLS.
WHEN YOU HAVE SO LITTLE, THIS IS
THE WAY TO GO.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO SOUND
LIKE A MONSTER FOR SAYING, THIS
BUT IF KIDS IN THIRD-WORLD
COUNTRIES ARE GETTING THESE
COMPUTERS AND THEY ARE, YOU
KNOW, LEARNING AND IMPROVING
THEMSELVES, WHO IS GOING TO MAKE
OUR CHEAP CLOTHING AND DIG OUR
BLOOD DIAMONDS?
AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE A MONSTER
BY SAYING THAT.
AM I?
DO YOU THINK I'M A MONSTER?
>> NO.
THE ANSWER IS EASY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
>> ROBOTS.
YOU DON'T NEED PEOPLE TO DO THAT
IT'S CHEAPER TO HAVE ROBOTS DO
IT.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WELL I'M ALL FOR
BEING GOOD TO PEOPLE THEN.
HOW MANY OF THESE HAVE YOU
DISTRIBUTED SO FAR?
>> TWO MILLION.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH DO THEY
COST, BY THE WAY IN
>> THEY COST ABOUT $180.
>>
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> WE TRIED THE MAKE IT $100,
THEN THE DOLLAR KEPT GOING DOWN.
SO WE NEVER QUITE MADE IT.
>> Stephen: THESE KIDS FIRE
UP, LITTLE EARS COME UP LIKE
THAT AND IT OPENS LIKE THAT AND
KIDS CAN TURN THEM AROUND LIKE A
BOOK OR SOMETHING.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BOOKS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.
WE CAN PUT 100 BOOKS ON ONE OF
THOSE WITHOUT TAKING UP MUCH
MEMORY.
YOU SEND 100 INTO A VILLAGE,
EACH HAS 100 DIFFERENT BOOKS.
THAT VILLAGE NOW HAS 10,000
BOOKS.
YOU AND I DIDN'T HAVE 10,000
BOOKS.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY THIS IS
GOING TO KILL THE PRINTED BOOK.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: WHY?
I LOVE THAT IDEA, BUT IS IT
GOING TO DO IT?
>> THE PHYSICAL BOOK IS A LUXURY
AND YOU CAN'T SHIP ENOUGH OF
THEM.
IF I'M DOING 10,000 IN 500,000
VILLAGES IN AFRICA, 500,000
VILLAGES IN INDIA, I CAN'T SHIP
THEM ALL 10,000 BOOKS.
BY THE WAY, THIS HAS ANOTHER
PROPERTY.
CAN I DO IT?
>> I DON'T WANT TO BREAK YOUR
STAGE.
>> YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH MOST
COMPUTERS.
AND SO THE KIDS...
>> Stephen: CAN I DO THAT?
THAT LOOKS ENTERTAINING.
>> YOU CAN DO IT, YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: SO THIS THING
IS...
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> SO IT COULD BE A MURDER
WEAPON.
>> Stephen: IT COULD BE.
NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO GET MORE OF
THESE INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE
AROUND THE WORLD?
>> WHAT I NEED IS MONEY TO GET
THEM TO KIDS IN THE REALLY POOR
COUNTRIES.
SEE, THE COUNTRIES LIKE PERU AND
URUGUAY, POOR COUNTRIES, EVERY
CHILD IN THE COUNTRY, EVERY
SINGLE ONE HAS GOT ONE OF THOSE
COMPUTERS, AND MANY OF THOSE
KIDS ARE TEACHING THEIR PARENTS
HOW TO READ AND WRITE.
>> Stephen: ARE WE GOING TO...
THAT'S POWER IN THE HANDS OF
CHILDREN.
>> YOU BET IT IS.
IT IS POWER.
AND THOSE KIDS ARE GOING TO GROW
UP WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
POINT OF VIEW ON WHAT LIFE
MEANS, HOW TO GET SORT OF...
>> Stephen: ARE WE GIVING ANY
OF THESE TO AMERICAN KIDS?
>> WE CERTAINLY SHOULD BE.
>> Stephen: WE GOT SOME POOR
KIDS IN AMERICA, TOO.
>> BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENT
SCALE.
>> Stephen: SHOULDN'T WE GIVE
IT TO THE AMERICAN KIDS WHO CAN
FIGHT BACK AGAINST BECOMING
URUGUAYANS.
>> NATIONALISM IS A DISEASE.
>> Stephen: NATIONALISM IS A
DISEASE?
>> IT'S A BIG DISEASE, THE
BIGGEST DISEASE.
WE'RE 5% OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: WE'RE THE BEST 5%
OF THE WORLD.
( APPLAUSE )
WELL MR. NEGROPONTE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
