>> Stephen: I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE WITH YOU.
BILE -- I'LL BE WITH YOU IN JUST
A MOMENT, NATION.
I'M JUST ANSWERING SOME E-MAILS.
THIS TIME OF YEAR I GET SO MANY
HOLIDAY INVITATIONS.
I JUST LIKE TO PERSONALLY REJECT
EACH ONE OF THEM.
OH, LOOK AT THIS, HERE'S AN
ACTUAL E-MAIL I RECEIVED FROM
MATT DAMON.
JIMMY, THROW UP A PICTURE SO
PEOPLE KNOW WHO MATT DAMON.
IS THERE HE IS.
OKAY.
HE'S PROBABLY ASKING ME TO DO
HIS STUNTS THE NEXT "BOURNE"
PICTURE.
MAN UP, DAMON.
I'VE JUMPED THROUGH MY LAST 27
27th STORY WINDOW THROUGH MY
LAST 23rd WINDOW TO KILL MAN
WITH MANILA ENVELOPE.
>> HI, STEPHEN, I'M WRITING TO
HELP WATER.ORG.
IF YOU WOULD TWEET, I'D
APPRECIATE IT.
BECAUSE OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW YOUR TREATS,
I'M SURE YOU'RE INUNDATED LIKE
THIS.
WOW, A BIG HOLLYWOOD STAR
E-MAILING ME TO HELP WITH THIS
THOROUGHLY WORTHWHILE CAUSE.
THE ANSWER, IS OF COURSE, YOU GO
TO HELL, MATT DAMON.
LY NOT EXPLOIT MY 1.9 TWITTER
FOLLOWER TO PLUG WATER.ORG WHICH
AIMS TO PROVIDE CLEAN, SAFE
DRINKING WATER TO PEOPLE.
I'LL TALK ABOUT IT ON MY SHOW
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO POINT
OUT THAT MATT DAMON IS BEGGING
ME TO TWEET ABOUT WATER.ORG, AND
I AM SAYING, YOU GO TO HELL,
MATT DAMON.
I WOULD SAY THAT MAKES ME A
BIGGER STAR THAN MATT DAMON.
HANG OUT WITH CLOONEY, PLEASE.
BESIDES, MY TWEETS ARE TOO
POWERFUL.
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I
RECENTLY RECEIVED AN ACTUAL
E-MAIL FROM TWITTER INFORMING ME
THAT MY JUNE 16th TWEET
ABOUT THE B.P. SPILL IN HONOR OF
OIL-SOAKED BIRDS TWEETS ARE NOW
GURGLES WAS THE NUMBER-ONE MOST
RETWEETED TWEET IN 2010.
