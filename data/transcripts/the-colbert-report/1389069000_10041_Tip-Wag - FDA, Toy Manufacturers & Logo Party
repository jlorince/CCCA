FIRST UP ON THE,-- WORKINGON IT, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY
DAY THE GOVERNMENT PASSESYET ANOTHER NEW
FREEDOM-KILLING REGULATION.
FIRST THEY TELL ME I HAVE TOWEAR A SEAT BELT.

COMING AFTER A FOOD ANIMALSAS IF THERE'S ANY OTHER
KIND.
SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF MYFINGER TO THE FDA.
FIRST OF ALL ANTI-BIOTICSARE THE ONLY NUTRITION LEFT
IN OUR MEATS.
THAT AND THE BLUE DYE IN THEUSDA SAMPLE.
MY DOCTOR SAYS I'M TO THEGETTING ENOUGH SAP.
AND OUR LIVESTOCKS NEEDTHESE ANTI-BIOTICS TO GAIN
AS MUCH AS 3% MORE WEIGHT.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, FOLKS,YOU WANT TO GAIN WEIGHT
QUICKLY TAKE ANTI-BIOTICS.
YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHTQUICKLY YOU EAT UNREGULATED
BEEF.
HOW ELSE CAN YOU GET ANIMALSTO GAIN WEIGHT.
CHICKENS WON'T DRINK MUSCLEMILK.
I GOT THEM A STRAW ANDEVERYTHING.
NOTHING.
(LAUGHTER)NEXT UP, FOLKS I BELIEVE
CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE.
EVEN THOUGH I'M PRETTY SUREMOST OF MY CHILDHOOD WAS IN
THE PAST.
I GOT SCREWED ON THAT ONE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIPOF THE HAT TO TOY
MANUFACTURERS FOR BRINGINGTHE TOYS OF TOMORROW TO THE
FUTURE PEOPLES OF TODAY.
>> FISHER-PRICE HAS RELEASEDTHE NEWBORN TODDLER APP
DIFFICULTITY SEAT.
A BABY BOUNCEY SEAT THATFEATURES A PLASTIC CASE
DESIGNED TO HOLD AN iPAD.
>> Stephen: OH, FOLKS, IWISH WE HAD THE APP-TIVITY
BABY SEAT WHEN I HAD MYFIRST CHILD.
I HAD TO SETTLE FROMPLOPPING HER IN FRONT OF THE
MICROWAVE.
MY DAUGHTER'S FAVORITE SHOWWAS SWANSON SALISBURY STEAK
FOR 10 MINUTES ON DEFROST.
IT HAS A SURPRISE ENDING.
ABOUT AN HOUR LATER.
NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAIDTHAT PUTTING AN iPAD IN
FRONT OF AN INFANT MIGHT BEHARMFUL IN SOME WAY.
BUT DON'T WORRY YOU CAN LOCKYOUR iPAD INTO THE CASE
PROTECTING YOUR DEVICE FROMBABY'S STICKY FINGERS.
SEE, NOTHING IS GOING TOHURT YOUR PRECIOUS DARLING.
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAYTO DOCK BOTH YOUR iPAD AND
YOUR CHILD.
>> AS A MOM, I KNOW HOWDIFFICULT POTTY TRAINING IT
BE.
IT CAN BE A LITTLE EASIERNOW WITH THE BRAND-NEW
I-POTTY THIS POTTY TRAININGSEAT FEATURES A SPECIAL
STAND TO SECURELY HOLD THEiPAD WHICH KIDS ALREADY
LOVE.
SO THEY CAN PLAY WITH APPS,READ BOOKS OR WATCH VIDEOS.
ALL WHILE POTTY TRAINING.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: I-- I WANT ONE.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD USEAN iPAD ON THE TOILET.
I GENERALLY NEED ALL FOURLIMBS FOR STABILITY.
AGAIN, SALISBURY STEAK.
AND WHAT A GREAT TOOL FORTRAINING THE KIDS.
THEY'LL FOREVER ASSOCIATETHE iPAD WITH POOPING.
JUST AVOID BRINGING THEMINTO AN APPLE STORE.
FINALLY, FOLKS, THERE IS NOGREATER FAMILY TRADITION
THAN GATHERING TOGETHER ANDPLAYING BOARD GAMES.
REMEMBER THE FAMILY THATPLAYS TOGETHER, STAYS
TOGETHER BECAUSE A SINGLEGAME OF RISK CAN LAST
DECADES.
IT WILL BE A COLD DAY INHELL BEFORE MY SISTER-IN-LAW
SHARON GETS HER GRUBBY PAWSON IRKUTSK, THE GATEWAY TO
CAME CHAT SKA.
-- KAMCHATKA.
BUT FOLKS THESE FUN GAMESAREN'T ALL FUN AND GAMES.
THEY'RE ALSO EDUCATIONAL.
THINK OF ALL THE SPANISHLEARNED -- WORDS I LEARNED
FROM PLAYING UNO.
(APPLAUSE)>> HOW MANY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I LEARNED ONEO.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FINALLY, THERE IS A GAME
TO TEACH OUR KIDS WHAT THEYREALLY NEED TO KNOW.

T DESCRIBE IT, DO IT ORREVEAL IT PICK AN ACTION,
SET THE TIMER AND GO.

LOGO AND ALL NEW LOGO PARTY.
THE BRANDS YOU KNOW, THEGAMES YOU LOVE.
>> Stephen: IT'S JUST LIKECHAR ADDS OTHER THAN ACTING
OUT MOVIES AND TV SHOWSYOU'RE PAYING MONEY TO MEM
ORIZE CORPORATE MARKETING.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIGTIP OF THE HAT TO LOGO
PARTY.
JUST DO IT, IT'S GREAT.
MAYBE IT'S MAYBELLINE.
FOLKS IT IS HUGE.
>> FOLKS, IT USED TO BE SOHARD TO FIND ADVERTISEMENTS.
YOU HAD TO SIT THROUGHBORING TELEVISION SHOWS OR
LOAD AN INTERNET VIDEO OR BESOMEWHERE IN AMERICA.
WITH LOGO PARTY IMAGINE THEFUN YOU'LL HAVE GUESSING IF
THAT'S THE G LOGO FROM GUCHIOR C LOGO FROM CHANNEL AND
THEN FEELING BAD ABOUTYOURSELF THAT YOU CAN'T
AFFORD EITHER ONE.
THE GAME ENDS WHEN ONE PLAYERR DRAWS THE CORD FOR THE
LOGO PARTY LOGO FORCINGEVERYONE TO ACT OUT ALL THE
BRANDS IN LOGO PARTYSIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING A
CORPORATE SYNERGY BLACK HOLETHAT SUCKS IN YOUR ENTIRE
FAMILY UNTIL SOMEBODYREALIZES THE BLACK HOLE
