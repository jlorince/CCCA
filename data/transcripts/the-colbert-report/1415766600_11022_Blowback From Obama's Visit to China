(LAUGHTER)NATION, I KNOW I'VE OFTEN CALLED
PRESIDENT OBAMA A NATIONALEMBARRASSMENT, BUT I CAN'T DO
THAT TONIGHT BECAUSE, TONIGHT,HE'S AN INTERNATIONAL
EMBARRASSMENT.
(LAUGHTER)THIS TIME, HE'S IN CHINA, WHERE
HE'S ATTENDING AN ECONOMICSUMMIT AND, ONCE AGAIN, HE HAS
EMBARRASSED AMERICA.
FIRST OFF, HE WORE TRADITIONALCHINESE GARB BUT FORGOT THE
STARFLEET COMMUNICATOR.(LAUGHTER)
EVEN WORSE -- THAT'S NOT CANON-- EVEN WORSE WHEN HE SHOULD BE
OVER THERE CHEWING CHINA OUT, HEWAS CHEWING SOMETHING ELSE.
>> A FAUX PAS BY PRESIDENTOBAMA.
SOME ARE ACCUSING HIM OF BEINGRUDE FOR EMERGING FROM
HIS CAR YESTERDAY CHEWING GUM.
>> IT APPEARED HE WAS CHEWINGGUM AS HE WALKED WITH THE
CHINESE COUNTERPART.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS INCHINESE MEDIA THAT THE CHINESE
HERE IN BEIJING WERE OFFENDED BYTHE PRESIDENT'S GUM CHEWING.
MR. OBAMA WAS SEEN CHEWING HISNICORETTE GUM.
>> Stephen: THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS!
WHY ARE YOU CHEWING NICORETTE,MR. PRESIDENT?
YOU'RE IN BEIJING -- THE ONEPLACE ON EARTH WHERE INHALING
BURNT TAR IS THE HEALTHY CHOICE.
(LAUGHTER)AND I'M JUST AS OFFENDED AS THE
CHINESE PEOPLE. AS WE ALLLEARNED
IN GRADE SCHOOL, IF YOU WANT TOCHEW GUM, YOU BRING
ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY -- THAT'S1.3 BILLION STICKS.
(LAUGHTER)I ASSUME THEY LIKE BIG RED.
(LAUGHTER)SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT OBAMA WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY CHINESEINTERNET USERS AS AN IMPOLITE
"IDLER" OR CARELESS "RAPPER."
(LAUGHTER)WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH THE HIP-HOP
RAPSMEN LOVE REPRESENTIN' THEG-U-M.
AS SNOOP ONCE RHYME-FLOWED --"ROLLIN' DOWN THE STREET,
CHEWING SPEARMINT, THINKIN' BOUTJUICY FRUIT, WITH MY MIND ON MY
BUBBLES AND MY BUBBLES ON MYMIND."
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
REST IN PEACE, TWO-PACK.
(LAUGHTER)YOU, TOO, WRIGLEY SMALLS.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT NOT EVERYONE AT THE SUMMITWAS ACTING LIKE A GUM-SMACKING
TEEN.
REAL PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTINWAS TRYING TO GET HIM SOME
DIM SUM.
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN GIVING HISCOAT TO CHINA'S FIRST LADY.
THE REASON?
SHE WAS COLD.
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN CREATED A STIRBY SLIPPING A SHAWL OVER THE
FIRST LADY OF CHINA AND THECHINA MEDIA, WHICH IS
STATE-BACKED, IMMEDIATELYREMOVED THE IMAGE.
>> Stephen: WHAT A GENTLEMAN.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK VLAD,AND HE WILL GIVE YOU THE SHIRT
OFF HIS BACK.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THE THING THAT HAS ME EVEN
MORE OUTRAGED THAN HOW MUCHDISRESPECT OBAMA SHOWED CHINA
WAS HOW MUCH RESPECT HE SHOWEDCHINA.
>> DID THE LEADER OF THE FREEWORLD BOW TO THE CHINESE
PRESIDENT?
SOME SAY YES.
YOU CAN SEE HE TILTS HIS HEADGREETING PRESIDENT XI.
>> YOU CAN SEE THAT HE TILTS HISHEAD GREETING THE PRESIDENT
YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen: YES, SOME SAY HEBOWED!
FIRST FOX, NOW ME -- TWO ISSOME.
(LAUGHTER)AND JUST LOOK AT THAT HEAD TILT.
THERE IT GOES!
OH, YES!
YES, IT'S BARELY NOTICEABLE, BUTMY DIGITAL TEAM WAS ABLE TO
PROJECT WHERE HE WANTED TO GOWITH THAT.
OH...
THAT IS SHAMEFUL. I CAN'TBELIEVE
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ALLOWING METO DO THIS TO HIM.
AND NOW HIS PANTS ARE FALLINGDOWN!
(LAUGHTER)WHERE'S THE DIGNITY?
SOMEBODY, COVER THAT MAN UP!
(LAUGHTER)THANK YOU! AND I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE OUT THERE ENRAGED BY BARACKO-BOW-MA.

(LAUGHTER)FOX BUSINESS ANALYST AND
UNSHAVED SPEEDBAG BO DIETL GOTHIS DIETL ALL OVER THIS STORY.

BO DIETL AND I BOTH KNOW TODAYIS VETERANS DAY -- EVEN THOUGH
ONLY ONE OF US IS SURE WHAT YEARIT IS.
(LAUGHTER)>> WE'RE IN 20 -- AND WHAT IS
THIS?
15, ALMOST 14.
WHAT WE GOT TO ALL REMEMBER, THEONLY REASON WHY WE'RE ABLE TO
SIT HERE AND TALK AND NOT WEARABBA-DABBA-DOO HATS OR WHATEVER
IS BECAUSE OF THESE VETERANS.
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR OUR VETERANS,WE'D ALL BE WEARING
ABBA-DABBA-DOO HATS, PUSHING--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PUSHING AROUND
ABBA-DABBA-DOO CARS, AND ARGUINGWITH OUR ABBA-DABBA-DISHWASHERS.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S TIME WE COULD BE SPENDING
WITH OUR BAM-BAMS.
(LAUGHTER)I'M WITH BO DIETL.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IN THEYEAR -- I DUNNO, I'M GOING TO
GUESS 20-TIPPITY-2, WE DON'TRESPECT OUR TROOPS.
THEY FOUGHT FOR US, ON THEBEACHES OF OOH LA LAH,
ZUT-DE-PUT-DE-TU-TI, IN THEJUNGLES OF VIET-PLING-PLANG, AND
IN THE DESERTS OFABOO-GABOO-STAN.
THEY'RE THE HEROS.
WHAT IF WE DONE WITH OUR LIVES?
SPENT THEM SCREAMING ON TV.
INCOHERENTLY?
I JUST HOPE SOME DAY SOON I CANLEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND.
MAYBE RETIRE TO THE COAST OF RIOBA-DA-BINGO.
THEN AGAIN, I'VE ALWAYS WANTEDTO SEE THE CLIFFS OF
MALA-KAKI-KOOKY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
