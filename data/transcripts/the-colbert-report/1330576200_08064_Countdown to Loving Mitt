( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE
"REPORT"!
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THAT'S GOOD STUFF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I CAN TELL EVEN FROM THIS
DISTANCE THAT THAT STUFF IS PURE
AND UNCUT.
(LAUGHTER)
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, FOLKS,
NATION TWO BIG G.O.P. PRIMARIES
LAST NIGHT.
MICHIGAN, THE WOLVERINE STATE
AND ARIZONA THE "HEY, BROWN GUY,
PULL OVER" STATE.
IT WAS REALLY BIG WINS FOR
ROMNEY.
I MEAN, TAKING HIS HOME STATE OF
MICHIGAN BY A WHOPPING 3.2%.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW TO THOSE LOOKING FOR A
CHAMPION TO DEFEAT OBAMA, THAT
SEEMS A LITTLE WEAK BUT MITT
REALLY CHARGED US UP.
>> WE DIDN'T REALLY WIN BY A LOT
BUT WE WON BY ENOUGH.
>> Stephen: YES!
THERE'S YOUR BATTLE CRY.
ROMNEY, 2012.
ENOUGH.
(LAUGHTER)
GOD, I'M SO SCARED.
SHAKE IT OFF!
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THROUGHOUT
WHO IS A LITTLE MITT-BIVALENT.
CONSERVE 2 +*EU6 COLUMNIST IN
ERICK ERICK ZORN WHO WROTE "IF
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT PANIC AND
TRYING DESPERATELY TO PULL BOBBY
JINDAL IN INTO THE RACE
TOMORROW, THE PARTY LEADERS MUST
HAVE A DEATH WISH."
YES!
THAT'S THE TICKET.
WE CAN STOP OBAMA WITH JINDAL'S
ELECTRIFYING STAR POWER.
JIMMY, HIT ME WITH SOME JINDAL
JUICE.
>> AS A CHILD I REMEMBER GOING
TO THE GROCERY STORE WITH MY
DAD.
>> Stephen: YES!
GET BOBBY JINDAL OUT THERE.
IF HE'S NOT 35 YET, GET HIM A
FAKE I.D., WE'RE DESPERATE.
SOMEBODY, ANYBODY, RUBIO,
CHRISTIE, THAT LADY WHO'S NOT A
WITCH!
HOW ABOUT CUATO?
AT THIS POINT HE'S MORE
APPEALING TO WOMEN THAN
SANTORUM.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I MEAN IT!
THIS IS CRUNCH TIME.
IF ROMNEY PERFORMS WELL NEXT
SUPERTUESDAY THEN WE
CONSERVATIVES KNOW OUR DUTY.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, MOST
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO GET
BEHIND ROMNEY.
>> I THINK IF IT ENDS UP BEING
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICANS, AS
THEY ALWAYS DO, WILL COME
TOGETHER AND SUPPORT HIM.
>> I BELIEVE WE AND WE'LL UNITE
BEHIND MITT ROMNEY.
YES.
>> Stephen: ONE WEEK FROM NOW
WE WILL MOST LIKELY COME
TOGETHER AND SUPPORT THE GUY
WE'RE HOPING IS NOT THE GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
JIMMY?
START THE COUNTDOWN TO LOVING
MITT CLOCK.
WE NOW HAVE... HAVE...
(APPLAUSE).
WE NOW HAVE SIX DAYS, 23 HOURS
AND 59 MINUTES TO FIND A
REPLACEMENT FOR THIS ROBOTIC
PLUTOCRAT WHO COULDN'T HOLD THE
ATTENTION OF CATS WITH A CAN OF
TUNA.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AFTER SUPERTUESDAY WHEN THIS
CLOCK RUNS OUT ON, LET'S SAY,
"SUCK IT UP WEDNESDAY" WE
CONSERVATIVES WILL DUTIFULLY
LOVE MITT ROMNEY'S WHOLE GRAIN
LIGHTLY TOASTED VISION FOR A
FIBROUS AND REGULAR AMERICA.
