EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, NATION, MORE ON NEW
HAMPSHIRE IN A MOMENT, BUT
FIRST, WE TURN TO THE SCANDAL
ENGULFING THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE,
A NEW BOOK OMINOUSLY CALLED "THE
OBAMAS."
IT HAS REVEALED A SHOCKING
SECRET FROM 2009 THE PRESIDENT
DOES NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT.
>> NEW CONTROVERSY OVER AN
"ALICE IN WONDERLAND"-THEMED
HALLOWEEN PARTY AT 1600
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.
>> JOHNNY DEPP WAS STANDING AT A
TABLE AT THIS PARTY GREETING
GUESTS DRESS AS THE MAD HATTER.
>> THEY'RE HAVING "ALICE IN
WONDERLAND" PARTIES O WHEN THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 9.9% IN THE
COUNTRY.
>> THIS BIG, DECEDENT,
HOLLYWOODESQUE-TYPE HENRY VIII
BASH.
>> APPARENTLY THE PEOPLE AT THE
PARTY WERE DRINKING PUNCH OUT OF
BLOOD VILES.
>> IT WAS SO EXEXTRAVAGANT GANTT
THAT GUESTS DRANK FRUIT PUNCH
FROM BLOOD VILES.
>> Stephen: THIS PARTY WAS SO
EXTRAVAGANT THAT MANAGED TO
ANGER NOT ONE BUT TWO DOOCYS.
TWEEDLE DEE AND TWEEDLE DOOCE.
[APPLAUSE]
BUT WHY?
WHY, FOLKS?
I ASK YOU, WHY ARE THESE OBSCENE
DETAILS COMING TO LIGHT ONLY
NOW?
>> THE WHITE HOUSE WENT OUT OF
THE WAY TO COVER THIS UP, TO
KEEP THIS QUIET.
>> THEY COVERED IT ALL UP
BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT
IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE HAVING
A GOOD OLD TIME AT TAXPAYERS'
EXPENSE.
>> HERE WE ARE WITH WHAT'S A
MINICOFFERUP, IF YOU WILL, SO TO
SPEAK.
>> YES, AN OLD-FASHIONED HUSH
JOB, IF YOU WERE, SO TO SPEAK
AND AS YOU WERE.
AND THIS MALICE IN BLUNDERLAND
CONTINUES TO DEAFEN.
OH, OH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
TRADEMARK.
OH.
AND DID WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
ERIC SCHULTZ CRANK UP THE SPIN
MACHINE, SAYING, "IF WE WANTED
THIS EVENT TO BE SECRET, WE
PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE INVITED
THE PRESS CORPSES TO COVER IT,
RELEASE PHOTOS ON FLICKR AND
RELEASE VIDEO ON THE WHITE HOUSE
WEB SITE.
WELL, THAT'S JUST HIDING IN
PLAIN SIGHT.
THAT'S THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE
BOOK.
OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS BEGS THE
OBVIOUS QUESTION.
>> IF WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,
WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THERE
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?
>> THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION.
>> Stephen: YES, IT IS.
AND, FOLKS, I HAVE HEARD
DISTURBING RUMORS THAT EVERY
YEAR THEY HOLD A PAGAN DRUIDIC
TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY, AND LAST
YEAR IT WAS HOSTED BY A
TRANSLEWIS -- TRANSLEWIS NT FIRE
GIANT.
DANGEROUS MAN.
BUT, FOLKS, ONE DETAIL OF THIS
HALLOWEEN PARTY THAT HAS ANGERED
ME EVEN MORE THAN THE FACT IT
WAS HELD FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR
MILITARY IS THE FACT THAT THE
ORIGINAL CHEWBACCA MINGLED WITH
INVITED GUESTS.
WHAT THE HELL IS CHEWIE DOING IN
WONDERLAND?
CHEWBACCA, CHEWBACCA WOULD NEVER
SIP TEA OR PLAY CROQUET USING
FLAMINGOS AS MALLETS.
THAT IS SO NOT CANAAN.
HE IS A FEROCIOUS WOOKIEE
SMUGGLER WHO TRAVELS THE GALAXY,
NEVER LEAVING HAN SOLO'S SIDE
FOR THE LIFE DEBT WHEN HAN
REFUSED TO KILL CHEWIE AT
IMPERIAL COMMAND.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE QUEEN OF
HEARTS TRY TO EXECUTION
CHEWBACCA WITH ONE SNAP OF THOSE
MIGHTY PAWS.
IT WOULD BE OFF WITH HER HEAD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
PLUS, PLUS... PLUS WHEN WOULD HE
FIND TIME TO LEAVE HIS HOME
WORLD OF KASHYYYK.
TO JOIN THE MAD HADDER AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
HE DOESN'T EVEN CELEBRATE
HALLOWEEN.
HE CELEBRATES LIFE DAY WITH HIS
FATHER ITCHY, HIS WIFE MALLA AND
HIS SON LUMPY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
NO MATTER HOW MUCH GEORGE LUCAS
WANTS US TO FORGET 1978'S "THE
STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL.
" SO THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[RECORD SCRATCHES PAWRNS
ALWAYS THERE.
SO... IF ANY OBAMA VOTERS ARE
STILL CLINGING TO THEIR SUPPORT
OF THIS MAN, CONSIDER THIS: YOUR
PRESIDENT USED HIS HOLLYWOOD
CONNECTIONS TO THROW A HALLOWEEN
PARTY FOR OUR TROOPS' KIDS AND
THEN TOLD US ABOUT IT.
AND IF THAT BEING A SCANDAL
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO YOU, LET
ME PUT IT IN MORE UNDERSTANDABLE
WORDS:
'TWAS BRILLIG, AND THE
SLITHY TOVES DID GYRE AND GIMBLE
IN THE WABE.
ALL MIMSY WERE THE BOROGOVES AND
THE MOME RATHS OUTGRABE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
