(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I'M NOT SURPRISED
THERE ARE A LOT OF ANGRY
PEOPLE OUT THERE.
AMERICA IS STUCK IN A JOBS
CRISIS.
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT THIS
WEEKEND I DROVE BY HOME
DEPOT AND PICKED UP A
CARPENTER, A LANDSCAPER AND
A GASTROENTEROLOGIST.
BEST $10 COLONOSCOPY I EVER
HAD.
GRACIAS.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, FINALLY, FOLKS, THERE
WAS A SIMPLE WAY TO GET
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK AND
IT IS THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LOOK OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY.
OF COURSE PRESIDENT OBAMA
THINKS THAT SPENDING TAX
DOLLARS TO REBUILD ROADS AND
BRIDGES WILL PUT PEOPLE BACK
TO WORK.
BUT FOLKS, THE REPUBLICANS
KNOW THAT TO PUT PEOPLE BACK
TO WORK, YOU DON'T WANT TO
BUILD BRIDGES AND ROADS.
YOU HAVE TO TEAR DOWN SOME
WALLSNESS WE HAVE TO REDUCE
ONEROUS REGULATIONS WITHIN
WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF A
LOT OF THESE REGULATIONS.
>> WE'D LOVE TO SEE A
MORATORIUM ON FEDERAL
REGULATIONS WHICH ARE COMING
OUT BY THE THOUSANDS,
COSTING BUSINESSES BILLIONS
AND BILLIONS OF JOBS.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF
JOBS IS RIDICULOUS.
SO LET'S SAY JUST ONE
BILLION.
WITH 300 MILLION AMERICANS,
THAT'S THREE AND A THIRD
JOBS FOR EVERYONE.
AND REGULATIONS-- REGULATIONS
HAVE NEVER CREATED A SINGLE
JOB.
BUT LACK OF REGULATION
CREATES PLENTY.
CASE IN POINT.
THE JOB CREATING PROPOSAL BY
REPUBLICAN FLORIDA STATE
REPRESENTATIVE RICH WORKMAN.
OBVIOUSLY THE MAN TO CREATE
JOBS, IT'S RIGHT THERE IN
HIS NAME, WORKMAN, NOT TO
MENTION, RICH.
(LAUGHTER)
WORKMAN HAS A BOLD
REGULATION CUTTING SOLUTION
TO THE JOB CRISIS.
>> IT'S CALLED DWARF TOSSING.
FLORIDA OUTLAWS THIS
PRACTICE TO HELP KEEP LITTLE
PEOPLE FROM GETTING HURT.
BUT ONE FLORIDA LAWMAKER
SAYS THE LAW SHOULD ACTUALLY
BE REPEALED.
>> WHETHER YOU APPROVE OF
DWARF TOSSING OR NOT,
FLORIDA SHOULDN'T BE TELLING
LITTLE PEOPLE WHAT THEY
CAN'T DO, ACCORD-- ACCORDING
TO STATE REPRESENTATIVE RICH
WORKMAN.
>> Stephen: YES, DWARF
TOSSING.
NOW I APOLOGISE IF ANYONE'S
OFFENDED.
I'M SURE THERE IS A MORE PC
TERM.
OF COURSE, DWARF TOSSING IS
THE SPORT OF KINGS WHEREIN A
LITTLE PERSON PUTS ON A
HELMET AND IS HURLED BY A
FRAT GUY HAMMERED ON YAUINGER
SHOTS INTO A SOILED
MATTRESS.
YOU KNOW, FULL EMPLOYMENT.
OF COURSE THE LITTLE PEOPLE
OF AMERICA SAY THAT DWARF
TOSSING CAN LEAD TO
PSYCHOLOGICAL DANGERS AN
PARALYSIS.
AND HOLLYWOOD HAS BEEN
LOBBYING AGAINST IT FOR
YEARS.
EVEN REPRESENTATIVE WORKMAN
AGREES THAT DWARF TOSSING IS
WRONG.
>> I'M OFFENDED BY T I GET
IT, MI TOO.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHETHER OR NOT I THINK IT'S
A COOL THING TO DO.
THE REALITY IS I THINK IT'S
RIDICULOUS.
HOWEVER, IT'S NOT THE ROLE
OF GOVERNMENT TO SAY IT
SHOULDN'T BE DONE.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
WORKMAN THINKS IT'S
OFFENSIVE AND RIDICULOUS BUT
IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S
PLACE TO REGULATE IT.
WHEN JOBS ARE AT STAKE, THAT
DECISION SHOULD BE MADE BY A
MORE TRUSTED GROUP.
BAR OWNERS WHO NEED A THEME
NIGHT TO REPLACE WINGS AND
BOO B'S WEDNESDAY.
BECAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
FLORIDA'S DWARF TOSSING BAN
IS FOG BUT A JOB KILLER.
AS WORKMAN TOLD "THE PALM
BEACH POST", ALL THAT IT
DOES IS PREVENT SOME DWARVES
FROM GETTING JOBS THEY WOULD
BE HAPPY TO GET IN THIS
ECONOMY.
YES, DWARVES WOULD BE HAPPY
TO HAVE THESE JOBS.
I'M SURE THE ONLY REASON
PETER DINKLAGE IS ON GAME OF
THRONES IS BECAUSE HE
COULDN'T GET A GOOD JOB
BEING CHUCKED AT A WALL.
AND-- I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE
THAT REPEALING THIS BAN
WOULD BE A MASSIVE JOB
CREATOR.
JUST LOOK AT THE PROJECTED
GROWTH.
I SAY IF SOMEONE IS WILLING
TO DO A JOB, NO MATTER HOW
DANGEROUS, POINTLESS OR
DEHUMANIZING IT IS, THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS
STOPPING THEM.
I MEAN IN THIS ECONOMY-- IN
THIS ECONOMY, FOLKS, SHOULD
WE REALLY BE STOPPING PEOPLE
FROM HOLDING GLADIATOR BUM
FIGHTS OR REDHEAD RODEOS,
WHERE COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK
LASSO AND HOGTIE GINGERS.
OR SHOULD WE REALLY, WITH
UNEMPLOYMENT AT 9.4%, BAN
BABY JUGGLING OR ALBINO
PAINT BALL HUNTING OR EATING
SUSHI OFF THE COMATOSE.
THE POINT IS, THE ECONOMY
TODAY IS BAD.
AND IF YOU ARE'S NOT WILLING
TO TOSS TAX DOLLARS AS A
PROBLEM THEN THE ONLY THING
LEFT TO TOSS IS HUMAN
DIGNITY.
AND THAT'S
