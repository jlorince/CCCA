WELL, IT'S THE SECOND WEEK OF
THE NEW REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED
HOUSE, AND AS PROMISED, IT IS
NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL, FOLKS.
USUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE IN
CONGRESS ARE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS.
JIM?
>> PAIR OF REPUBLICAN HOUSE
MEMBERS ARE APOLOGIZING FOR
MISSING THEIR OATH OF OFFICE
WEDNESDAY.
PENNSYLVANIA'S MIKE FITZPATRICK
AND PETE SESSIONS OF TEXAS WERE
AT A EXCEPTION FOR CONSTITUENTS
WHEN THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS
BEING SWORN IN.
>> Stephen: AND THEY WOULD
HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT HAD
THEY LEFT MORE CONVINCING
STAND-INS.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT MEANS, FOLKS, TECHNICALLY
SESSIONS AND FITZPATRICK DID NOT
BECOME MEMBERS OF THE 112th
CONGRESS.
NOW, THEY HAD A GOOD EXCUSE FOR
MISSING THE SWEARING IN.
THEY HAD TO BE IN THE CAPITOL
VISITOR'S CENTER FOR A SWEARING
IN PARTY.
AND DEMOCRATS SAY THIS
SWEARING-IN PARTY VIOLATED HOUSE
ETHICS RULES AGAINST
FUND-RAISING ON CAPITOL GROUNDS,
BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF
FUND-RAISING, OTHER THAN IT
COSTS $30 TO ATTEND AND THE
INVITATION CONTAINED A CREDIT
CARD PAYMENT PAGE AND FEDERAL
RULES FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION
LIMITS.
SORRY, DEMS, THOSE RULES ONLY
APPLY TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,
AND THEY DIDN'T SWEAR IN.
CHECK AND MATE.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A
KERFUFFLE ABOUT WHETHER THEIR
VOTES ON LEGISLATION SHOULD
COUNT.
I SAY YES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
THEY HAD OFFICIALLY BEEN SWORN
IN.
>> THE PAIR SAID THEY WATCHED
THE SWEARING IN ON TV WITH THEIR
HANDS RAISED.
>> Stephen: THEY TELE-SWORE
IN.
AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT OATHS
MADE THROUGH THE TV ARE LEGALLY
BINDING.
THAT'S WHY I'M ACTUALLY THE
44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES BECAUSE RIGHT BEFORE
OBAMA RECITED THE OATH, I
SHOUTED IT AT MY SAMSUNG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND... AND A TELE-OATH IS ALSO
HOW I MARRIED PRINCESS DI.
NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT TAKING THE
OATH OF OFFICE THROUGH YOUR TV
MAKES YOU A CONGRESSMAN, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, HERE AND AT HOME,
PLEASE RAISE YOUR RIGHT HANDS.
SPEAKER BOEHNER.
>> DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT
YOU WILL SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES, AGAINST ALL ENEMIES
FOREIGN AND DOE PIX, THAT YOU
WILL BEAR TRUE FAITH AND
ALLEGIANCE TO THE STATES, THAT
YOU WILL WELL AND FAITHFULLY
DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF YOUR
OFFICE UPON WHICH YOU ARE ABOUT
TO ENTER, SO HELP YOU GOD?
>> Stephen: BOO-YA.
THERE IT IS.
YOU ARE NOW ALL OFFICIALLY
CONGRESSMEN.
CONGRATULATIONS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY.
AND HEY, HEY, BEST OF ALL, YOU
FINALLY HA
