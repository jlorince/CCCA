THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
TONIGHT IS BONUS EVE.
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT BEFORE MANY
WALL STREET BELL NAIRS GET THEIR
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BONUSES IF
THEY MADE THEIR CLIENTS MONEY.
OTHERWISE THEY GET NOTHING.
JUST KIDDING.
THEY STILL GET MULTIBILLION
DOLLAR BONUSES.
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET
ABOUT THESE BONUSES.
THAT'S WHY THE FOLKS AT GOLDMAN
SACHS TOLD "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERINGMAKING
THEIR TOP EXECUTIVES CONTRIBUTE
MORE MONEY TO CHARITY AND TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SUCH A
MOVE WOULD DAMP PUBLIC ANGER
OVER PAY.
YOU SEE, GOLDMAN SACHS C.E.O.
LLOYD BLANKFEIN REALLY DOES CARE
ABOUT PUBLIC RELATIONS.
[LAUGHTER]
I AM SO PROVED BY THEIR
POTENTIAL GESTURE OF
COST-BENEFIT ANALYZED GENEROSITY
THAT TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO
INAUGURATE A SPECIAL HONOR, THE
HUMANITARIAN-ISH AWARD.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT,
OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN THE
FIELD OF CONSIDERING WHETHER TO
GIVE TO CHARITY AS LONG AS
THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT FOR ME.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I HAVEN'T DESIGNED THE
AWARD YET, SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE A HEART
WITH WINGS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
THAT MIGHT BE NICE.
OR MAYBE A CRYSTAL DOLLAR SIGN,
WHICH WE WOULD FILL WITH BABY
TEARS.
[LAUGHTER]
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'M NOT SURE.
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT.
BUT FOR NOW I JUST WANT TO SEE
IF THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT I'M
CONSIDERING GIVING AN AWARD GETS
ME ANY GOOD PRESS.
SPEAKING OF GENERATING GOOD
PRESS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I GOT A
BRAND-NEW SET AND A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME, THANK YOU,
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD SET.
WELL, WE SENT IT TO A FARM UP
STATE.
WHERE IT CAN RUN AND PLAY AND
IT'S MUCH HAPPIER NOW.
WE SHOT IT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT WE SAVED SOME OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PIECES, FOLKS, AND
OVER NEXT THREE WEEKS, WE'LL BE
AUCTIONING OFF THEM FOR CHARITY
IN A CAMPAIGN WE'RE CALLINGN
A PIECE OF HISTOR-ME, COLBERT
