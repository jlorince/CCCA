[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO
HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, THE DOW LOST 519 POINTS
TODAY.
IT'S THE SINGLE BIGGEST DROP
SINCE TWO DAYS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO MAKE SENSE
OF THE MARKETS.
LUCKILY, THE NEW YORK POST
EXPLAINED IT ALL WITH TODAY'S
COVER STORY.
"CRAZY STOX LIKE A HOOKER'S
DRAWERS-- UP, DOWN, UP"!
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS IS ANALYSIS EVERYONE CAN
UNDERSTAND.
YOU GET A HOOKER, EVERYONE'S
EXCITED THAT HER PANTIES ARE UP.
THEN THE UNDERWEAR STARTS TO
DROP, PEOPLE START GETTING
UPSET, GROWN MEN ARE CRYING,
CLUTCHING THEIR HEADS, WORRIED
FOR THEIR FUTURES AND THEIR
CHILDRENS'.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN THE HOOKER PULLS HER
UNDERWEAR UP-- HAPPY DAYS ARE
HERE AGAIN, SOMEBODY RINGS A
BELL AND EVERYBODY GOES HOME.
IF YOU PAID THE EXTRA FIFTY
BUCKS FOR THE BELL.
AND IT'S NOT A BELL.
[LAUGHTER]
I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE OF THIS
KIND OF ANALYSIS SUCH AS:
"LONDON JUST LIKE HOOKER'S
GENITALS-- BURNING!" AND
"SOMALI REFUGEES LIKE HOOKER'S
LIBIDO-- ALWAYS HUNGRY!" AND
"NEW YORK POST FRONT PAGE LIKE
HOOKER-- WILL SAY ANYTHING TO
GET YOUR MONEY."
[LAUGHTER]
