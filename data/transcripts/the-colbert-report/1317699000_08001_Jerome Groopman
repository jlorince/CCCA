>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN
A NEW BOOK, YOUR MEDICAL
MIND, HOW TO DECIDE WHAT IS
RIGHT FOR YOU.
STEP ONE, DON'T GET SICK.
PLEASE WELCOME DR. JEROME
GROOPMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
JERRY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET YOUR
BON A FEDDEST OUT HERE
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
UNIMPRESSIVE, FIRST OF ALL
YOU'RE A PROFESSOR AT
HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND
CHIEF OF EXPERIMENTAL
MEDICINE AT BETH ISRAEL
DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTRE.
YOU ARE A NEW YORK STAFF
WRITER AND YOU HAVE A NEW
BOOK CALLED "YOUR MEDICAL
MIND: HOW TO DECIDE WHAT IS
RIGHT FOR YOU"
SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT I GET
TO DECIDE ON MY TREATMENT?
>> I-- WHY DID YOU GO TO
MEDICAL SCHOOL.
>> I WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL
TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE
RISKS AND BENEFITS AS AN
INDIVIDUAL ARE.
SO YOU CAN PUT YOUR VALUES
INTO THE DECISION.
>> Stephen: BUT I COME TO
YOU.
I'M SICK.
AND BY THE WAY DID YOU BRING
YOUR PRESCRIPTION PAD
TONIGHT.
DID YOU BRING ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
BECAUSE I HEAR THERE IS A
COUGH SYRUP WITH VICODIN
THAT WHATEVER YOU NEED FOR
THAT, I'VE GOT THAT.
>> JEFF TOOBIN WILL
REPRESENT ME.
>> Stephen: FANTASTIC.
BUT IF I'M A DEATHLY SICK
PERSON, DO I WANT TO YOU
TAKE OVER TO TELL ME WHAT'S
BEST FOR ME?
BECAUSE I'M DEALING WITH THE
STRESS OF BEING A
TERRIBLEABLY SICK PERSON.
>> I CAN HELP CERTAINLY
GUIDE YOU AND EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHAT THE RISKS AND BENEFITS
ARE.
BUT I NEED TO KNOW FROM YOU
WHAT YOUR PERSONAL APPROACH
IS.
WHAT YOUR PHILOSOPHY, HOW
MUCH RISK DO YOU WANT TO
TAKE.
HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE THE
BENEFIT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NOT WHAT
HOUSE DOES.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS EVEN WHAT MARCUS
WELBY DID.
TV DOCTORS DON'T DO THAT.
>> RIGHT, AND THOSE ARE THE
BEST DOCTORS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE MARCUS WELBY ERA IS
OVER.
BECAUSE MEDICINE IS NOT
BLACK AND WHITE.
THERE'S A LARGE GRAY ZONE.
FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK AT
MAMMOGRAMS.
>> Stephen: I-- I--
(LAUGHTER)
I-- I WAS GOING TO SAY-- I
GOT CAUGHT ONCE AND I DON'T
ANY MORE.
BUT GO AHEAD.
>> THE MAMMOGRAM WHAT AGE
SHOULD THEY BEGIN.
HOW OFTEN SHOULD THEY BE
PERFORMED ON A WOMAN.
FOUR DIFFERENT EXPERT GROUPS
COME UP WITH FOUR DIFFERENT
RECOMMENDATIONS.
HIGH CHOLESTEROL, SHOULD YOU
TAKE A STATIN PILL OR NOT.
WHAT IS YOUR RISK OF A HEART
ATTACK.
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE RISK
OF THE SIDE EFFECTS, MUSCLE
PAIN, INDIGESTION, LIVER
PROBLEMS, SO IT'S VERY
INDIVIDUAL.
>> Stephen: SO IF I'M A
PATIENT WHAT SHOULD I DO
BEFORE I TALK TO A DOCTOR.
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I'M
CHECKING WEB MD AND HI WILL
WANT TO GET A SECOND OPINION
FROM EITHER WICK
PEDESTRIANIA OR TWITTER
TWITTER-- WIKIPEDIA OR
TWITTER AND THEN ORDER SOME
CHEAP CANADIAN VIAGRA
THROUGH E-MAIL.
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO.
>> SO FIRST IS WHAT IS YOUR
PERSONAL APPROACH, ARE
YOU-- DO YOU WANT TO DO
EVERYTHING AND MORE.
>> YES.
>> OR ARE YOU A MINIMALIST.
DO YOU WANT TO DO JUST THE
MINIMUM NECESSARY.
OTHER PEOPLE LOOK TO
TECHNOLOGY, THE LATEST,
GREATEST, NEWEST DRUG OR
PROCEDURE.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
PERHAPS, ARE YOU A BELIEVER.
DO YOU REALLY THINK THERE IS
A SOLUTION SOMEWHERE FOR
YOUR MEDICAL PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: I DO.
BECAUSE IF THERE ISN'T, THEN
I WILL EVENTUALLY DIE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND THAT IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE, DOCTOR.
CHECK YOUR OATH.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: FIRST, NO ONE
DIES.
SECOND, DO NO HARM.
>> RIGHT.
THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY BUT
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
DOUBTERS.
PEOPLE WHO THINK IS THE
TREATMENT WORSE THAN THE
DISEASE.
SO THE FIRST QUESTION YOU
SHOULD ASK YOURSELF BEFORE
YOU SEE THE DOCTOR, AND THEN
TO ASK THE DOCTOR IS IF I DO
NOTHING, WHAT IS MY RISK FOR
A HEART ATTACK IF I HAVE A
HIGH COLEST RAL OR WHAT MY
RISK OF DYING IF I HAVE
PROSTATE KANNER OR WHATEVER.
THAT IS THE STARTING POINT.
THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION.
AND THEN YOUR INDIVIDUAL
VALUES, YOUR MIND-SET IS
MOLDED TO THAT INFORMATION.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IS WHAT YOU DO
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
>> WELL, WE CERTAINLY USE
DRUGS AND HAVE PROCEDURES
AND INSTRUMENTS THAT CROSS
STATELINES.
>> Stephen: SO.
>> SO IT IS.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
ARE YOU GOING TO TESTIFY
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.
>> NO.
NO, I'M NOT.
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE
SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU SEE, DOCTOR,
THIS IS WHY IT'S ANSWERS
LIKE THAT IS WHY WE ALWAYS
HAVE TO HAVE SECRETARY
OPINIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
DR. GROOPMAN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME, JEROME
GROOMMAN, THE BOOK IS YOUR
MEDICAL MIND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
