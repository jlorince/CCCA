>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT... I JUST HAD A
GUEST.
WHO IS IT?
MICHIO KAKU?
OH, I LIKE HIM.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHIO KAKU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
I'M A HUGE FAN.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE THE
AUTHOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
PHYSICS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE.
WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE THINGS
THAT I USED TO WATCH, LIKE THE
SCI-FI SHOWS I USED TO WATCH IN
THE AFTERNOONS WHEN I WAS
HOMESICK.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: THOSE THINGS COULD
BE REAL.
COULD WE TELEPORT?
>> WE ALREADY TELEPORT
INDIVIDUAL AT TOMS.
WE'RE GOING TO BE TELEPORTING UP
TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE AND MAYBE
UP TO THE SPACE STATION, MAYBE
TO THE MOON.
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S...
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT A CRAZY
PERSON?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A
THEORETICAL PHYSICIST.
>> I'M A THEORETICAL PHYSICIST.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE THE REAL
DEAL.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF, WHAT'S IT CALLED...
>> STRINGFIELD THEORY.
>> Stephen: THE CRAZIEST TYPE
OF PHYSICS, THOUGH, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S DEFINED IN HYPERSPACE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT?
>> HIGHER DIMENSIONS THAT WE
THINK COULD READ THE MIND OF
GOD.
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE DEAL
WITH.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU ANSWER A
QUESTION FOR ME?
ARE YOU ACTUALLY HERE, OR IS MY
FEVER JUST SO HIGH THAT I'M
HALLUCINATING THAT THERE IS A
JAPANESE MAN WITH CRAZY LONG
HAIR TALKING ABOUT READING THE
MIND OF GOD.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "READ THE MIND
OF GOD"?
I THOUGHT GOD HAS ONE OF THOSE
HELMETS THAT MAGNITO WEARS SO
YOU CAN'T.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN READ THE MIND
OF GOD.
>> WE WANT AN EQUATION THAT WILL
ALLOW US TO SUMMARIZE ALL THE
FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: ONE-INCH LONG
EQUATION.
SO SIZE DOESN'T MATTER WITH THIS
EQUATION.
>> EVIDENCE EQUALS MC SQUARED
UNLOCKED THE QAITION TO THE
STARS.
WE WANT A ONE-INCH EQUATION THAT
WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING FROM
THE BIG BANG TO THE CREATION OF
LIFE TO THE UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: AREN'T THERE
THEORIES FOR EVERYTHING?
THERE'S QUANTUM MECHANICS AND
THEN THERE'S THE PHYSICS OF
COSMOLOGY AND DON'T THEY
INTERRELATE?
ARE PHYSICS DIFFERENT, SMALL AND
LARGE?
>> WELL NEW YORK SOME SENSE GOD
HAS TWO HANDS.
ON ONE HAND WE HAVE THE QUANTUM
THEORY, AND THEN WE HAVE
EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF GENERAL
REAL DIFFICULT, BIG BANGS AND
BLACK HOLES.
THE TWO THEORIES ARE
INCOMPATIBLE.
>> Stephen: DID EINSTEIN WORK
ON THAT.
>> HE WANTED ONE FABRIC THAT
WOULD UNITE THE TWO THEORIES
INTO ONE COSMIC FRAMEWORK.
THAT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
>> Stephen: SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN EINSTEIN.
>> I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING
AFTER HIM WITH A LOT MORE DATA.
>> Stephen: SO YOU SEE THE
MISTAKES, YOU SEE THE POTHOLES,
THE MISTAKES HE MADE?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I CAN READ HIS UNIFIED THEORY
TODAY AND SEE WHERE ALL THE
MISTAKES ARE.
I CAN SEE WHERE THE DEAD ENDS
WERE.
30 YEARS OF ACTIVITY, I CAN SEE
EXACTLY WHERE HE HIT DEAD ENDS
AND DIFFERENT ROUTES WHERE HE
JUST GAVE UP BASICALLY.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY IT'S
POSSIBLE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TIME MACHINES.
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: ISN'T IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A TIME
MACHINE BECAUSE IF I GO BACK AND
KILL MY GRANDMOTHER THEN I'M
NEVER BORN.
STEPHEN HAWKING SAID, WHERE ARE
THE TIME TRAVELERS.
DO YOU LIKE HAWKING, BY THE WAY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: HE'S A JERK.
>> HE'S A COLLEAGUE OF MINE.
MAYBE THEY'RE INVISIBLE, BECAUSE
WE WILL HAVE INVISIBILITY WAY
BEFORE WE HAVE TIME TRAVEL.
MAYBE THEY'RE HERE IN THIS ROOM.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
WE'LL HAVE INVISIBILITY?
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT VERY
SOON, WITHIN THE COMING DECADE
WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING
RESEMBLING THE HARRY POTTER
INVISIBILITY CLOAK.
MAYBE THEY'RE ALREADY HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THEN I WOULD JUST
LIKE THE SAY ON BEHALF OF MY
FUTURE TRAVELERS, COME OUT, COME
OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE.
