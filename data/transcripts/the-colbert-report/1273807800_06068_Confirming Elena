THANK YOU.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST A LITTLE DISTRACTED.
I'M JUST CHECKING ON SOME OF THE
RUMORS ABOUT SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE ELENA KAGAN.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM ON
TUESDAY.
I TOLD YOU I COULDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THEM.
LAUGHTER LAUGHTER
YOU SEE, NO ONE WANTS TO BE
FIRST TO LET THE, LET'S SAY,
SUBARU OUT OF THE BAG.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THANK GOD, THANK GOD FOR
RUPERT MURDOCH.
THAT MAN KNOWS HOW TO REPORT THE
NEWS THAT YOU CAN'T REPORT.
YOU SEE, ON TUESDAY ON THE FRONT
PAGE OF MURDOCH'S "WALL STREET
JOURNAL," THEY FEATURED AN OLD
PHOTO OF KAGAN PLAYING SOFTBALL.
TOTALLY INNOCENT.
ALL PART OF THE JOURNAL'S
WELL-KNOWN COMMITMENT TO TITLE 9
SPORTS.
WELL, THEN SOME GAY RIGHTS
ORGANIZATIONS COMPLAINED THAT
THE PAPER WAS INSINUATING SHE'S
A LESBIAN, WHICH ISRY RIDICULOUS
THIS PHOTO DOES NOT MEAN
ANYTHING.
I MEAN, IN COLLEGE A LOT OF
GIRLS EXPERIMENT WITH SOFTBALL.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THE FACT THAT THESE
ORGANIZATIONS COMPLAINED ABOUT
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" IS
NEWS, WHICH THEN ALLOWED
MURDOCH'S OTHER PAPER, "THE NEW
YORK POST," TO RUN A STORY ON
PAGE SEVEN ABOUT THE COMPLAINT
ABOUT THE "JOURNAL" RUNNING THE
PHOTO WITH THE HEADLINE, "DOES
THIS PHOTO SUGGEST HIGH-COURT
NOMINEE ELENA KAGAN IS A
LESBIAN?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS, THIS, FOLKS, IS GREAT
JOURNALISM.
ALL THE BEST HEADLINES ARE
QUESTIONS.
REMEMBER VJ DAY.
"IS THE WAR OVER?"
OR THE MOON LANDING, "HAS ANYONE
SEEN NEIL ARMSTRONG LATELY?"
THE POINT IS THE "POST" IS NOT
SAYING SHE'S A LESBIAN.
THEY'RE JUST ASKING THE QUESTION
NEXT TO PHOTO OF KAGAN PLAYING
SOFTBALL, WHICH ITSELF IS NEXT
TO AN ARTICLE SAYING ALL WOMEN
WHO PLAY SOFTBALL ARE LESBIANS.
THIS IS WHAT I ADMIRE.
ANY NEWS ORGANIZATION CAN GATHER
NEWS, BUT MURDOCH KNOWS HOW TO
MAKE IT A SUSTAINABLE CROP.
HE PLANTS THE NEWS IN THE "WALL
STREET JOURNAL," HE FERTILIZES
IT IN THE "NEW YORK POST," AND
THEN HE HARVESTS IT ON FOX NEWS.
>> CRITICS CALL IT A BLATANT
ATTEMPT TO INCENDIARY WAIT THAT
KAGAN IS A LESBIAN.
>> THE GAY AND LESBIAN ALLIANCE
AGAINST DEFAMATION HAS SAID IT'S
CLEARLY AN ILLUSION TO HER BEING
GAY.
>> NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT
BECAUSE THE WOMAN PLAYED
SOFTBALL SHE MAY BE GAY.
>> Stephen: ENOUGH.
CONSIDERING HOW MUCH THEY REPORT
ON THEIR OWN STORIES, FOX NEWS
MAY BE GAY FOR ITSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I DO, FOLKS...
[APPLAUSE]
I DO... I HAVE TO FAULT MURDOCH
ON ONE THING.
HE BURIED THE LEAD.
IN THIS ARTICLE OVER HERE IT
SAYS, "SOME SAY THAT LESBIANS
AND SOFTBALL GO TOGETHER LIKE
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY."
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN FEEDING OUR
KIDS?
AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE... AND I
CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF
SICK STUFF IS GOING ON IN A JAR
OF GOOBER GRAPE.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE SOME SORT
OF HERMAPHRO-SPREAD.
AND WHAT DOES IT SAY, FOLKS,
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME THEY
EAT MY PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY
SANDWICH LIKE THIS?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THAT IS DELICIOUS.
>> ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS TO
EVERYBODY INVOLVED.
BY THE WAY, SHE'S NOT GAY.
THE WHITE HOUSE DENIES IT.
FRIENDS HAVE DENIED IT,
INCLUDING OLD PRINCETON PAL
ELIOT SPITZER, WHO SAYS HE KNOWS
SHE'S STRAIGHT.
AND IF SPITZER SAYS IT, THAT
PROVES SHE'S NOT A LESBIAN.
SHE'S A PROSTITUTE.
NATION...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I GOT SOME SERIOUS RUMORS STUCK
TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH.
