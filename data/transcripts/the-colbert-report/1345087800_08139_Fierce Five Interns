THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I COULD DO THAT TWICE A NIGHT.

IT'S REALLY NICE.
NOT AS NICE AS THE REPLICA I HAD BUILT AT HOME BUT MUCH NICER THAN THE ONE ON MY JET.

A SHOUT OUT RIGHT NOW TO ALL MY INTERN WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS WEEK'S CONCERT.

THANK YOU GUYS ENOUGH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BUT, FOLKS, WE'VE GOT THE NEW BATCH OF INTERNS THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST ONES TO DATE.

ABROAD PROGRAM IN LONDON.
ANYWAY, THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL AND SPEAKING OF WHICH I DON'T HAVE MY PEN.
