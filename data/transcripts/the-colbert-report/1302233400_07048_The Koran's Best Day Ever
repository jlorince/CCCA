[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
>> STEPHEN: WOW, WOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GOTTA
TELL YOU -- WHOA IT'S ELECTRIC
IN HERE.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THAT KIND OF
ENERGY, YOU KNOW IT'S A THURSDAY
NIGHT CROWD.
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, THERE IS BIG NEWS IN ONE
OF OUR WARS.
GUESS WHICH ONE?
[LAUGHTER]
AFGHANISTAN!
[LAUGHTER]
LAST WEEKEND A WAVE OF TRAGIC
DEADLY VIOLENCE ERUPTED IN
PROTEST TO THE BURNING OF A
KORAN BY FLORIDA PASTOR AND
MUSTACHE VICTIM TERRY JONES.
IT SEEMS JONES BURNED THE KORAN
AFTER HE FOUND IT GUILTY IN HIS
OWN MOCK TRIAL.
THAT IS SO WRONG, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
HOLY BOOKS MUST BE JUDGED ONLY
BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS, THE
BIBLE, BHAGAVAD GITA, AND EAT
PRAY LOVE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT OPENED MY EYES.
TO THE POWER OF NOONTIME
DAKRIES.
PASTOR JONES IS NOT BACKING DOWN
SAYING QUOTE "I WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN STOP PREACHING ABOUT
ISLAM."
HE MAY HAVE A CHANCE TO DO BOTH.
FOLKS, OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY HAS
GOT TO STEP UP AND RESOLVE THE
TENSION BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND
ISLAM AND AS USUAL IT FALLS TO
ME.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE LONG BEEN ON RECORD THAT
ISLAM IS A GREAT AND TRUE
RELIGION AS REVEALED BY THE
PROPHET MOHAMMED PEACE BE UPON
HIM.
ARE WE CLEAR WITH THAT?
I MAY BE CATHOLIC BUT I'VE GIVEN
IT UP FOR LENT SO TO HEAL THIS
DIVISION, I AM NOW OFFICIALLY A
MUSLIM.
OKAY?
IT'S A GOOD LOOK.
I'M NOT AN EXTREMIST, FOLKS, I'M
A MODERATE MUSLIM.
OH, MY GOD!
WE DO EXIST.
LISTEN UP MY FELLOW MUSLIMS,
FORGET ABOUT THIS PASTOR JONES
GUY.
HE IS JUST ONE SOUTHERNER WITH A
MUSTACHE AND NOT EVEN THE ONE
WHO TRULY REPRESENTS AMERICA.
[LAUGHTER]
HERE IS HOW I'M GOING TO FIX
THIS WHOLE PROBLEM IF BURNING
THE KORAN CAUSES THIS MUCH
TROUBLE, I SAY WE SHOW THE KORAN
THE BEST DAY EVER.
I HAVE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO DO IT.
FIRST I TAKE THE KORAN FOR A
BOAT RIDE IN CENTRAL PARK.
THEN MAYBE TAKE IT TO A GAME AT
YANKEE STADIUM.
AND NOTHING SAYS FUN AND
FRIENDSHIP LIKE A RIDE ON THE
CONEY ISLAND CYCLONE.
FINALLY, NO TRIP TO NEW YORK
WOULD BE COMPLETE LIKE TAKING IN
A BROADWAY SHOW LIKE "THE BOOK
OF MORMON."
I THINK THE KORAN WOULD GET A
CHUCKLE OUT OF THAT ONE.
MORMONS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, TO BE CLEAR, NONE OF THAT
HAPPENED.
AND THIS ISN'T EVEN A COPY OF
THE KORAN.
WE JUST PUT THAT WORD ON A BOOK.
BUT IF YOU ARE MUSLIM AND YOU
THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA, DROP ME
A LINE BY E-MAIL.
OK, PROBLEM SOLVED.
EXCEPT NOW THAT I'M A MUSLIM I
HAVE A STRONG URGE TO RANDOMLY
SEARCH MYSELF.
