>> Stephen: OH, HI, I DIDN'T
SEE THREW.
I HAVE BEEN HUFFING EGG
NOTHING.
NATION THIS IS THE LAST SHOW,
OF 2011.
A YEAR THAT HAS BEEN TOUGH
ON EVERYBODY.
ACCORDING TO A RECENT NBC
NEWS "THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL" POLL, 76% OF
AMERICANS CALL 2011 EITHER
BLOW AVERAGE OR ONE OF THE
WORST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES.
NOW COME ON, FOLKS.
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S THE END
OF THE WORLD.
THAT'S 2012.
ANYWAY, I HOPE THAT IN SOME
SMALL WAY THIS SHOW HAS
BRIGHTENED YOUR SPIRITS THIS
YEAR AND THAT-- WHAT'S THAT!
OH, IT'S SANTA.
HEESE'S HERE!
WHAT'S THAT-- OH, OH, OH,
IT'S THE RED SCHWINN
SPEEDSTER I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED.
OH--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OH, FATHER
CHRISTMAS, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, I AM A GOOD BOY!
I AM A GOOD BOY.
WHOOO!
>> GOD BLESS US, EVERYONE.
>> Stephen: OUT OF MY WAY,
NERD.
I'M A GOOD BOY.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
I'M A GOOD BOY!
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
WHOOO!
