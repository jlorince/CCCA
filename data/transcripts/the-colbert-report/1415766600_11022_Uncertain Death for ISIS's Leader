ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI. U.S.WARPLANES ATTACKING
A CONVOY NEAR MOSUL IN IRAQ THISWEEKEND.

THAT THIS BRUTAL MURDERER ISHYPOTHETICALLY OUT OF THE
PICTURE.

TO ROOM TEMPERATURE SO IT'SREADY TO CHILL IF THAT PROVES
NECESSARY!
(LAUGHTER)AND WHILE I, OF COURSE, WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW FORCERTAIN THAT THE MONSTER WHO
PROMISED TO TURN NEW YORK INTOAN ASH-HEAP IS DECEASED, AT
LEAST THIS UNCERTAINTY GIVES OURTABLOIDS TIME TO STOCK UP ON
THEIR ZINGER HEADLINES,LIKE WHEN SADDAM WAS SENTENCED
TO HANG, THE "NEW YORK POST"WENT WITH "GOOD NOOSE."
(LAUGHTER)OR WHEN WE KILLED BIN LADEN AND
FOUND PORN IN HIS COMPOUND, THEYHIT US WITH THIS ACTUAL
HEADLINE.
"OSAMA BIN WANKIN."
(LAUGHTER)AND WHO CAN FORGET THAT WHEN WE
GOT AL QUAIDA IN IRAQ LEADER ABUMUSAB al-ZARQAWI, THE "POST"
COVER SCREAMED "GOTCHA" ANDFEATURED A DEATH PHOTO WITH A
SPEECH BUBBLE SAYING "WARM UPTHE VIRGINS."
AND YOU KNOW THOSE WERE HISACTUAL LAST WORDS, BECAUSE
IF THEY WEREN'T, LEGALLY, THE"POST" WOULD HAVE HAD TO
USE A THOUGHT BUBBLE.
(LAUGHTER)ONCE WE KNOW al-BAGHDADI IS
DEAD FOR SURE, THERE'S GONNA BEA GOLD RUSH FOR THE PERFECT
HEADLINE.
WHICH IS WHY I'M STAKING MYCLAIM TONIGHT AND HEREBY
COPYRIGHT THE FOLLOWINGPHRASES:.
Al-BAGH-DEAD-Y.
