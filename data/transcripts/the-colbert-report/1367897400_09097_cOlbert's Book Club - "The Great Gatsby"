>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
PLEASE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, I
AM SUPER TIGHT WITH MEDIA MOGUL
AND THING-FAVORITER OPRAH
WINFREY.
WE HAVE THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
WHERE YOU CAN GO YEARS WITHOUT
SEEING EACH OTHER AND WE PICK UP
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.
OR AT LEAST I ASSUME WE WILL
WHEN WE MEET FOR THE SECOND
TIME.
OF COURSE I'M A HUGE FAN OF O,
OPRAH'S BOOK CLUB.
THAT'S WHY I STARTED O,
C"O"LBERT'S BOOK CLUB AS A
TRIBUTE AND AS A THEFT.
>> NOW, FOLKS, OUR FIRST BOOK IS
THE GREAT GATSBY BY F. SCOTT
FITZGERALD.
LOOK FOR IT IN BOOKSTORES
BETWEEN E.E. CUMMINGS AND G.
GORDON LIDDY.
IT'S CLEARLY A TOWERING PILLAR
OF WESTERN LITERATURE BECAUSE IT
IS NOW A 3D MOVIE.
AND I HOPE YOU'VE STARTED
READING, FOLKS, BECAUSE ON
THURSDAY PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING
AUTHOR JENNIFER EGAN WILL LEAD
MY BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION, AND I
WILL BE JOINED BY DIRECTOR BAZ
LURHMAN.
LIKE ALL BOOK CLUBS WE'LL OPEN A
BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY, TALK
BROADLY ABOUT THEMES AND THEN
LAUNCH INTO A HEATED DISCUSSION
ABOUT THE NEIGHBOR WHO LEAVES
HIS TRASH BIN OUT ON THE CURB
FOUR DAYS AFTER PICK UP.
YOU'RE ALREADY OUT THERE TO GET
THE MAIL, ALAN, HOW HARD IS IT
JUST TO BRING IT BACK IN?
SERIOUSLY.
UNFORTUNATELY SOMEONE HAS
ALREADY RIPPED OFF MY IDEA TO
RIP OFF OPRAH'S IDEA.
THIS WEEK THE B.B.C. WORLD BOOK
CLUB IS ALSO FEATURING THE GREAT
GATSBY.
WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.
THE BRITS ARE ALWAYS COPYING OUR
BEST IDEAS.
THEY DID IT WITH THE OFFICE.
DA ALI G SHOW AND DOWNTON ABBEY
WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS IS BASED ON
FRIENDS.
IT'S SO UNREALISTIC.
SO UNREALISTIC.
THERE IS NO WAY THOSE KIDS COULD
AFFORD THAT ABBEY.
SO IF YOU'RE ALSO READING GATSBY
FOR THE B.B.C., YOU HAVE TO READ
IT ONCE FOR EACH CLUB.
THE AMERICAN VERSION FOR MINE.
FOR THEIRS THE ENGLISH VERSION.
ALL THE CHAPTERS ARE IN CELSIUS.
INSTEAD OF WEST EGG, GATSBY
LIVES IN EAST BANGERS-UPON-MASH.
NOW I'LL BE READING RIGHT UP
UNTIL MY FIRST BOOK CLUB MEETING
THURSDAY WHEN I ASSUME WE WILL
DISCUSS HOW THIS OPULENT
CONSEQUENCE-FREE LIFESTYLE
REACHES ITS
