(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW, FOLKS, HOW HARD IS THAT?
THINK.
HOW HARD IS THAT?
AND, FOLKS, THIS EARTHACANE
COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A WORSE
TIME.
AMERICANS ARE FEELING PRETTY
SHAKY AS IT IS.
POLLS SHOW THAT JUST 22% OF
AMERICANS ARE SATISFIED WITH
THEIR LIVES, ONLY 45% ARE
SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK.
75% BELIEVE THE COUNTRY ON THE
WRONG TRACK.
AND 93% WERE TOO DEPRESSED TO
RESPOND TO THE POLLSTERS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
BUT THERE IS ONE SIMPLE WAY WE
CAN LIFT OUR SPIRITS, AND IT'S
THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HAPPY ENDINGS.
NOW, FOLKS, I AM NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE KIND OF HAPPY ENDINGS
THAT SHOW UP ON YOUR CREDIT CARD
BILL AS "SHIPPING AND HANDLING."
(LAUGHTER)
THE NEWS PEOPLE EXPLAIN.
>> NOW A SPOILER ALERT.
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY ENJOY A STORY
MORE IF YOU KNOW HOW IT ENDS
BEFORE YOU BEGIN.
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT A NEW STUDY
IS SAYING.
>> Reporter: THE RESEARCHERS
FOUND THAT IN EVERY CASE READERS
WHO ALREADY KNEW THE ENDING
ENJOYED THE STORY MORE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY I
ALWAYS READ THE END OF A BOOK
FIRST.
THAT WAY I CAN SIT BACK, PUT MY
FEET UP ON THE BOOK AND ENJOY
SOME T.V.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THE RESEARCHERS... THE
RESEARCHERS SAY THAT WHEN WE
AREN'T ANXIOUS ABOUT HOW A STORY
IS GOING TO END WE ENJOY IT
MORE.
FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE I KNOW
THIS SENTENCE IS GOING TO END
WITH APPLAUSE, I CAN SAVOR ALL
THE WORDS LEADING UP TO THE
GREATEST AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO, FOLKS, FOR THOSE OF YOU...
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT
SEEN THEM, ALLOW KNOW MAXIMIZE
YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE FOLLOWING
MOVIE: ROSE BUD IS A SLED, BRUCE
WILLIS IS DEAD, ED NORTON IS
BRAD PITT, HE WAS EARTH ALL
ALONG, SOY LENT GREEN IS PEOPLE,
SHE'S GOT A DONG, DARTH VADER IS
LUKE'S FATHER, LEIA IS HIS
SISTER, AND C-3PO ISN'T FOOLING
ANYONE.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THIS... THIS IS HOW WE
CAN BREAK OUT OF OUR NATIONAL
BLUES!
BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE THE HEROES
OF OUR OWN STORIES.
AND IF WE KNOW HOW THIS ENDS,
WE'LL ENJOY IT MORE.
SO GET READY FOR THE GRANDDADDY
OF ALL SPOILERS: YOU DIE.
(LAUGHTER)
DID I JUST TURN THAT FROWN
UPSIDE DOWN?
AND FOLKS, NOT JUST YOU!
EVERYBODY DIES.
AND HERE, HERE IS THE BEST PART.
WHEN YOU DIE, EVERYTHING THAT'S
BOTHERING YOU RIGHT NOW ENDS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR INSTANCE, YOU KNOW HOW
SOMETIMES YOU ROLL YOUR EYES
WHEN YOUR PARENTS CALL AND WANT
TO TALK FOR AN HOUR?
FOLKS, THAT WILL END.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF YOU'RE A PARENT, YOUR
KIDS WHO ARE DRIVING YOU NUTS
DRAINING YOUR ENERGY AND BANK
ACCOUNT AND TAKE FOREVER TO GET
THEIR SHOES ON, WELL, HERE'S THE
TWIST, THEY LEAVE YOU.
IT ALL ENDS!
EVERYTHING ENDS.
THE JOB YOU HATE, THE MONEY YOU
OWE, TINY PORK PIE HATS.
PLANKING.
YOUR SECOND MORTGAGE.
THE NATIONAL DEBT.
SUMMER.
AND...
(LAUGHTER).
SCIENTISTS CLAIM THAT BILLIONS
OF YEARS FROM NOW ALL ENERGY
WILL BLEED FROM THE UNIVERSE AND
EXISTENCE AS WE KNOW IT WILL
CEASE.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, EVENTUALLY EVEN THIS SHOW
WILL BE CANCELED.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
BUT KEEP IN MIND JUST WHY WE
LIKE SPOILERS.
ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS, THE
PLOT IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT AND
ONCE YOU KNOW HOW IT TURNS OUT,
YOU CAN FOCUS ON A DEEPER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE STORY.
TRUE.
THAT'S THE REASON I NOW KNOW
THAT GREEN LANTERN IS REALLY
ABOUT THE $12 I'LL NEVER GET
BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
SO SINCE WE KNOW HOW EVERYTHING
ENDS, WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS: WE
CAN EITHER WORRY OR WE CAN ENJOY
THE SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, OH, OH.
I LOVE THIS PART.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, THAT'S GOOD, TOO.
THAT'S GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WAS EXCITING.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I BET YOU SAW THAT COMING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
