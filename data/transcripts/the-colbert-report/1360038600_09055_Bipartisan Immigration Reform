FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FIRST LATINA ON THE SUPREME COURT.
SO TO ANY HISPANIC VIEWERS JOINING US FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WANT TO SAY: WELCOME!
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I ASSURE YOU THAT WELCOME HAS AN UPSIDE-DOWN EXCLAMATION MARK IN FRONT OF IT.
OR AS I CALL IT, A "MEXCLAMATION" MARK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, NACION, I'VE LONG HAD A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY EVER SINCE THEY VOTED
BARACK OBAMA INTO A SECOND TERM.
FOR CONSERVATIVES, IT WAS A SOBERING MOMENT.
OR AT LEAST IT WOULD BE, IF I COULD STOP DRINKING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AGAIN, THANK YOU, CAPTAIN MORGAN.
BUT THE GOP LOST THE HISPANIC VOTE BY 44 POINTS.
71% TO 27%.
11 MILLION HISPANICS VOTED FOR OBAMA.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU LAID THEM ALL END TO END, AND STACKED THEM TEN HIGH, YOU'D
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD START ON A BORDER WALL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T GET IT: I THOUGHT HISPANICS CAME HERE TO DO THE JOBS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO DO,
LIKE VOTING FOR THIS GUY.
( LAUGHTER ).
WHAT IS HIS NAME?
IT'S GOING TO COME TO ME.
HOLD ON, I'LL REMEMBER HIS NAME.
ITS GOING TO COME TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CHIP RANCHERO?
WHERE DID WE GO WRONG?!
THE GOP AND HISPANICS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISPANIC VOTE, IN SO MANY WAYS, IT SEEMS IT SHOULD BE NATURAL FOR SOME OF
THEM TO VOTE GOP.
>> HISPANICS ARE NOT INHERENTLY LIBERAL.
HISPANICS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TIGHT FAMILY.
THEY HAVE-- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE RELIGIOUS CATHOLIC, THEY'RE SOCIALLY-CONSERVATIVE.
>> THIS OUGHT TO BE OUR VOTE.
THEY'RE SOCIALLY, ECONOMICALLY CONSERVATIVE, PATRIOTIC, CHURCH- GOING, FAMILY-ORIENTED PEOPLE
WHO ARE VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL.
COALITION.
>> Stephen: YEAH!
HISPANICS AND REPUBLICANS GO TOGETHER LIKE BEANS AND VERY, VERY WHITE RICE--
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE BEANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GRANTED, WE CONSERVATIVES MAY HAVE SAID A FEW NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT IMMIGRANTS IN THE PAST,
BUT NOW ALL OF THAT IS JUST AGUA UNDER THE SPANISH WORD FOR BRIDGE, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE
NOW REACHED OUT TO A GROUP THEY TRUST EVEN LESS THAN MEXICANS: DEMOCRATS.
>> INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE SENATE-- FOUR FROM EACH PARTY-- SAID TODAY THEY HAVE A
BREAKTHROUGH ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> THESE 11 MILLION PEOPLE NEED TO COME OF THE SHADOWS AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS UNACCEPTABLE.
WE HAVE BEEN TOO CONTENT FOR TOO LONG TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO MOW OUR LAWN, SERVE OUR FOOD, CLEAN
OUR HOMES AND EVEN WATCH OUR CHILDREN WHILE NOT AFFORDING THEM ANY OF THE BENEFITS THAT
MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO GREAT.
>> Stephen: YES, LATINO IMMIGRANTS DESERVE THE SAME BENEFITS-- SOCIAL SECURITY,
MEDICARE, PUBLIC EDUCATION-- THAT ALL AMERICANS ARE SLOWLY LOSING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT, FOLKS, DONT THINK THIS IS SOME BLANKET AMNESTY WITH NO PRICE TO PAY.
JUST ASK FLORIDA SENATOR AND REGISTERED LATINO MARCO RUBIO.
>> YOU HAVE TO IDENTITY YOURSELF.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINGERPRINTED.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK DONE.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY MUST BE FINGERPRINTED, AND HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS.
AFTER ALL, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET CITIZENSHIP, NOT AN ASSAULT WEAPON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THESE PEOPLE LOVE ASSAULT WEAPONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, THIS COMPLETELY CHANGES HOW REPUBLICANS WILL BE PERCEIVED THROUGH THE LATINO LENS.
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO REVIVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AMONG HISPANICS.
>> IT TAKES AWAY FROM DEMOCRATS THE RACE CARD AND IT ALSO LETS NERVOUS WHITE VOTERS KNOW THIS
IS NOT A RACIST PARTY.
>> THE ONE THING ABOUT IF THIS PLAN COMES TO PASS, HOW ARE THE DEMOCRATS GOING TO CALL
REPUBLICANS RACIST ANYMORE?
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE.
>> Stephen: YES, REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE RACISM OFF THE TABLE-- OR HAVE THEIR BUSBOY DO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EITHER WAY, IT'S GONE.
OF COURSE, NO SURPRISE THAT LAST WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED TO JUMP ON THE MARIACHI BANDWAGON
WITH HIS OWN PLAN.
BUT MY FRIENDS AT FOX NEWS KNOW WHAT QUE REALLY PASAS HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WHY DIDN'T HE JUST SAY-- HEY, SENATE, GO FOR IT.
>> THIS WAS A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN MANY WAYS.
>> MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT HELPFUL TO FLY IN AND DO A CAMPAIGN-STYLE EVENT AND ATTACK
PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING TO THE TABLE WITH A SENSIBLE PLAN.
>> WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN?
IS IT FOR HIM TO REALIZE, SOMETIMES, SILENCE IS GOLDEN?
>> Stephen: MEGYN KELLY'S RIGHT-- SILENCE IS GOLDEN.
THAT'S WHY I OFTEN PREFER TO WATCH HER SHOW ON MUTE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BESIDES HISPANIC VOTERS KNOW THAT IMMIGRATION REFORM IS MOVING FORWARD ONLY BECAUSE
REPUBLICANS DECIDED TO STOP BLOCKING IT.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE OBAMA CREDIT FOR SUPPORTING IT ALL ALONG.
THAT WOULD BE LIKE PASSING A KIDNEY STONE AND THANKING YOUR DOCTOR-- INSTEAD OF THE KIDNEY
STONE, FOR TAKING YOU ON SUCH A CHARACTER-BUILDING ADVENTURE OF AGONY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
GETTING THOSE WORDS OUT WAS ALMOST LIKE PASSING A KIDNEY STONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLUS, WHILE OBAMA'S TRYING TO WOO HISPANICS, HE'S ALREADY FLIRTING WITH ANOTHER MINORITY
GROUP ON THE SIDE.
ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE WEBSITE, OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION PLAN TREATS SAME-SEX FAMILIES AS FAMILIES.
WHAT'S NEXT, MR. PRESIDEN, TREATING GAY PEOPLE AS PEOPLE?
HERE'S THE IDEA: THE PLAN "GIVES U.S. CITIZENS AND LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS THE ABILITY
TO SEEK A VISA ON THE BASIS OF A PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP WITH A SAME-SEX PARTNER."
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WANTS TO LET GAY FOREIGNERS ACROSS THE BORDER TO TAKE OUR GOOD-PAYING, AMERICAN GAYING JOBS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, FOLKS, I BELIEVE IN AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
AND THIS IS AN INSULT TO AMERICAN GAYS.
WHO I MAY NOT APPROVE OF, BUT I BELIEVE THEY ARE THE GAYEST IN THE WORLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OUR GAY PEOPLE -- THEY ARE NOT JUST HOMOSEXUAL.
THEY'RE HOMO-CEPTIONAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
