RZ WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU READ THE PAPERS,
YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC TIMES.
IF FACEBOOK CAN'T MAKE MONEY WITH A FREE SERVICE THAT OFFER THOSE TANGIBLE BENEFIT
WHAT HOPE IS THERE FOR THE REST OF US?
>> THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO SAFEGUARD ALL YOUR ASSETS.
CASH, REAL ESTATE, AND OF COURSE FRUIT.
BUT TOO OFTEN YOUR FRUIT INVESTMENTS ESPECIALLY BANANAS ARE VULNERABLE TO SMOOSHING, JOSTLING, OR
ROUGH HANDLING WHILE PRETENDING TO USE IT AS A PHONE.
WELL, THAT ENDS NOW THANKS TO THE BANANA BUNKER.
THE ONLY ALL IN ONE PROTECTION SYSTEM THAT KEEPS YOUR INDIVIDUAL BANANA SAFE.
AND UNLIKE THE CUMBERSOME BANANA PROTECTORS OF YOUR PARENT'S DAY BA BANANA
BUDGET CERTIFICATE EASY TO USE.
>> REMOVE THE CAP, SLIDE THE BANANA INTO THE CONTAINER.
THE MAIN BODY THEN THE CAP.
AND IT'S READY TO GO.
>> GREAT.
SO WHERE'S THE INSTRUCTION VIDEO FOR THE BANANA?
HOW DO YOU WORK THIS THING?
THEORY, OPEN BANANA.
ENGAGE.
AWESOME.
WELL, FOLKS, I JUST ORDERED MY BANANA BUNKER.
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU ONE THING.
IT COST $16, THAT'S 6.99 FOR THE BUNKER PLUS 8.55 FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING.
YES, THAT'S PRICEY BUT IT WILL SPARE YOU THE TIME AND HUM ILIATION OF CUTTING OFF
THE BRUISED PART OR BUYING FOREBANANA FOR 25 CENTS.
WHICH MEANS THE BANANA BUNKER PAYS FOR ITSELF IN ONLY 64 BANANAS.
AND FOLKS-- IS IT DURABLE?
IS IT DURABLE, JUST WATCH IT IN ACTION.
>> WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE DURABILITY OF THE BANANA BUNKER WITH MY
FRIEND MICHAEL AND HE'S GOING TO DROP IT FROM THE FIFTH STORY BUILDING.
THERE WE ARE.
AND IF YOU COULD DO A CLOSE-UP THERE IS YOUR PERFECT BANANA.
>> PERFECT FOR ALL THOSE TIMES MI OUT ON A FIRE ESCAPE WITH A BANANA THAT I AM NOT EATING.
AND WHEN I REACH FOR MY PHONE OR ELECTRIC RAZOR, MY BANANA PLUMMETS TO THE GROUND.
NOW I'M OUT ON THE FIRE ESCAPE WITHOUT A BANANA LIKE SOME [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> BANANA BUNKER AS GOOD AS IT IS, IT CAN'T PROTECT MY APPLE.
CAN'T PROTECT MY APPLE,
OBVIOUSLY OR MY ZUK INI.
-- ZUCHINIT JUST DOESN'T FIT.
ALSO IMPORTANT, BANANA BUDGET CERTIFICATE NOT FOR PLAN TAKENS, OKAY.
FORS THAT YOU NEED THE PLAN TAKEN PADDOCK.
(LAUGHTER) BUT STEPHEN, YOU'RE WONDERING,
(LAUGHTER) WHAT ABOUT THEFT.
BANANA BUNKER COULD BE COMPROMISED BY CRIMINALS.
SO TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO ENTER THE GROWING FRUIT PROTECTION MARKET WITH MY
ADT CERTIFIED HOME FRUIT SECURITY SYSTEM.
ALL DOW IS YOU JUST ARM THE SYSTEM AND YOUR BANANA IS SAFE AND SECURE FROM EVEN
THE CRAFTIEST OF FRUIT BURGLARS.
OKAY.
NOW LET'S SAY I'M READY TO EAT MY BANANA.
I JUST ENTER MY CODE WHICH IS MY BIRTH YEAR, 1982, AND IT'S BANANA TIME.
>> OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, FINE, FINE, 1964.
AND ALL RIGHT.
(APPLAUSE) SEE?
NOW I CAN'T EAT IT.
IF ONLY HI PUT THIS IN A BANANA BUNKER.
DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU.
