( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH

NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
MADAM, ARE YOU A DEMOCRATICSENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF
NEW YORK, AND YOU'VE GOT A NEWBOOK, AND IT IS CALLED "OFF THE
SIDELINES-- RAISE YOUR VOICE,CHANGE THE WORLD."
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
I KNOW YOU GOT A BOOK TO PUSH.
( LAUGHTER )BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD TO
GET OUT OF BED THIS MORNING.
KNOWING THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVEBEEN RELEGATED TO THE DUST BIN
OF HISTORY.
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S ELECTIONS,THE LAST ELECTION, I UNDERSTAND,
THERE EVER WILL BE.
( LAUGHTER )HOW DOES IT FEEL?
WAS IT HARD TO GET UP THISMORNING?
>> YOU KNOW, I WAS A LITTLEDISAPPOINTED, OF COURSE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT REMAINS TO BESEEN TO SEE IF MITCH MdCONNELL
SAYS-- IS GOING TO DO WHAT HESAYS HE'S GOING TO DO WHICH IS
ACTUALLY TRY BRING PEOPLETOGETHER AND GET THINGS DONE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU DEMOCRATSARE FINALLY GOING TO GET OUT OF
THE WAY, STOP BEING SUCHOBSTRUCTIONIST OF THE
REPUBLICANS' AGENDA?
I MEAN, ALL THE THINGS THEY RANON,
ARE YOU GOING TO HELP THEMACHIEVE THOSE PLANS FOR
AMERICA'S BETTER FUTURE?
>> WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FINDCOMMON GROUND, AND THAT'S
SOMETHING I HAVE DONE IN THEPAST, AND DOING SOMETHING LIKE
MAKING SURE STUDENTS CANREFINANCE THEIR FEDERAL LOANS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YOU KNOW, WORKING ON ENDING
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON COLLEGECAMPUSES--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S THE KIND OF COMMON GROUND
I HOPE WE CAN GET DONE, AND ITHINK WHAT THE ELECTION WAS
REALLY ABOUT IS PEOPLE AREANGRY.
THEY'RE FRUSTRATED.
THEY LOOK AT WASHINGTON AND THEYKNOW IT'S BROKEN, AND THEY WANT
US TO LISTEN TO THEM AND DOTHEIR JOB.
AND I'M AS FRUSTRATED AS THEYARE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TOHELP THE REPUBLICANS ACHIEVE
THEIR NUMBER ONE GOAL-- BUILD ATIME MACHINE AND MAKE BARACK
OBAMA NEVER HAVING EXISTED?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> WELL, I HOPE THAT THEY ARESINCERE AND ACTUALLY WANT TO DO
THE BUSINESS OF THE AMERICANPEOPLE, FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY,
FOCUSING ON GETTING THINGS DONE.
>> Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY AREON AN INTERESTING COMMITTEE.
YOU'RE ON THE ENVIRONMENT ANDPUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE.
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANEW CHAIRMAN, JAMES INHOFE.
YOU AND HE DIFFER SLIGHTLY ONGLOBAL WARMING.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HE'S GOT SOMEINTERESTING IDEAS.
HE BELIEVES IT IS NOT HAPPENING.
( LAUGHTER )AND THAT IT IS A HOAX.
OKAY?
WHERE IS THE MIDDLE GROUND FORTHE TWO OF YOU?
ARE YOU GOING TO COME OVER TOHIS SIDE?
ARE YOU GOING TO COMPROMISE ONTHAT ONE AND JUST SAY IT'S NOT
HAPPENING AND I'M SURE HE'LLAGREE WITH YOU.
>> I THINK THERE ARE SOME COMMONSENSE THINGS WE CAN WORK ON
ANY NEW YORKER KNOWS HOWCRUSHING SUPERSTORM SANDY WAS,
SO YOU HAVE THESE VIOLENTSUPERSTORMS COMING NOT ONCE
EVERY 100 YEARS BUT ONCE EVERYTWO YEARS.
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COMETOGETHER TO WORK ON THINGS AND
ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT.
>> Stephen: BUT HE'S FROMOKLAHOMA AND THEY DON'T HAVE
HURRICANES.
>> BUT THEY HAVE TORNADOES ANDTHERE ARE WILDFIRES IN THE WEST.
>> Stephen: AND THEY'REPREPARED TO ALLOW OKLAHOMA TO
BECOME ETHIOPIA, AND THAT IS THEOPPOSITE OF OUR PROBLEM, WHICH
WILL BE TOO MUCH WATER.
OKAY.
MAYBE YOU COULD MEET TOGETHERSOMEWHERE IN APPALACHA WHERE THE
WATERS WON'T RISE?
>> I WILL TRY TO WORK TOGETHERTO FIND COMMON GROUND TO ADDRESS
THESE REAL CHALLENGES OURCOMMUNITIES ARE FACING.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THATWASHINGTON WILL GET ANY MORE...
FRIENDLY NOW THAT Y'ALL CANSMOKE POT WITH EACH OTHER?
( LAUGHTER )LEGALLY.
DO YOU SMOKE POT?
>> NO.
BUT I THINK IT'S INTERESTINGTHAT A LOT OF STATES ARE TAKING
IT UP AS A REFERENDUM.
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT ISVERY RIPE FOR REVIEW.
AND I THINK FOR OUR STATE, IT'SREALLY IMPORTANT THAT ANY PERSON
WHO IS PRESCRIBED MEDICALMARIJUANA GETS ACCESS TO IT.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: BUT LEGALLY,LEGALLY, WHEN YOU'RE DOWN DOING
YOUR JOB, YOU KNOW, AND AFTERHOURS, LEGALLY, YOU GUYS COULD
ALL GET TOGETHER AND SMOKE POT.
>> WE COULD.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD.
>> WE COULD.
>> Stephen: MAYBE THAT WOULDHELP, MAYBE AND YOU MITCH
MdCONNELL GET TOGETHER-- I'MNOT SAYING, I DON'T SMOKE POT,
BUT MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD SMOKEPOT AND BE LIKE, "WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE COOL, I LOVE YOU."
YOU KNOW.
HE CAN CATCH HIS REFLECTION INSOMETHING AND GO,
"I DO LOOK LIKE A TURTLE.THAT'S HILARIOUS."
YOU KNOW? THINK ABOUT IT.
IT COULD TURN THE CAPITOL INTOONE BIG BONG, IT WOULD BE
FANTASTIC.
WHAT DO YOU HOPE-- IF YOU COULDBRING LEGISLATION TO THE
REPUBLICANS, WHAT WOULD YOU--WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, "GUYS, LET'S
DO THIS TOGETHER?"WHAT WOULD YOU BRING TO THE
FLOOR FIRST?
>> I WOULD FOCUS ON ECONOMICAGENDA AND SPECIFICALLY PAID
FAMILY LEAVE. WE ARE THE ONLYINDUSTRIAL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
THAT DOESN'T CREATE PAID LEAVEFOR FAMILY EMERGENCIES
WHETHER IT'S A NEW BABY, A SICKFAMILY MEMBER,
AGING AND DYING PARENT.
>> Stephen: BUT WE DO ALLOW THEMTO LEAVE
PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVETHEIR JOBS. THAT'S A STEP
YOU CAN LEAVE.
YOU JUST CAN'T COME BACK.
>> MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TOLEAVE.
THE WOMAN WHO IS IT GOING TOCLEAN THE STUDIO TONIGHT CAN'T
AFFORD TO TAKE DAYS UNPAID.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALLWORKERS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, WHO
ARE OFTEN DEALING WITH A LOT OFFAMILY EMERGENCIES CAN GET THE
SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE IN THEWORKPLACE AND ACHIEVE THEIR FULL
POTENTIAL.
AND I WOULD FOCUS ON SOMETHINGAS SIMPLE AS EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL
WORK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: I RECENTLY, IDIDN'T KNOW THIS, I RECENTLY
FOUND OUT I WAS A FEMINIST SO IHAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.
WHEN YOU SAY "OFF THE SIDELINES"ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATS OR ARE YOU TALKINGABOUT WOMEN OR ANYBODY?
WHO IS ON THE SIDELINES THAT YOUHAVE TO GET OFF THEM?
>> IT'S ABOUT WOMEN.
>> Stephen: I CAN INTERESTED?
>> YOU CAN READ IT.
IF YOU DO YOU WILL LEARN A LOTABOUT-- YOU WILL LEARN A LOT
ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
>> Stephen: ONE THING IUNDERSTAND ABOUT MY WIFE, SHE
DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN I HOLDHANDS WITH WOMEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND.
