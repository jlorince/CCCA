>> WELCOME BACK.
>> RESULTING AND HE THINKSTHAT'S A BAD THING.
PLEASE WELCOME ANDREWBACEVICH.
WRING THANK YOU FOR COMINGON, GOOD TO SEE YOU, WELCOME
BACK.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> FOR PROFESSOR OF HISTORYAND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
IN BOSTON UNIVERSITY,VIETNAM VET, 23 YEARS 6
MILITARY SERVICE, RETIREDARMY CONTINENTAL EL AND A
NEW BOOK CALLED BREACH OFTRUST.
HOW AMERICANS FAILED THEIRSOLDIERS AND THEIR COUNTRY.
ALL RIGHT, THIS SOUNDS LIKEYOU'RE NOT IN FAVOR OF
MILITARY INTERVENTION INOTHER COUNTRIES TO SOLVE THE
WORLD'S PROBLEMS BY THEUNITED STATES.
>> I'M IN FAVOR OF MILITARYINTERVENTION WHERE IT MAKES
SENSE.
>> Stephen: SYRIA.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: LET'S BRINGTHOSE PEOPLE TO THE
BOOM-BOOM ROOM.
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, IF WE ACTUALLY
CARED ABOUT THE SYRIANPEOPLE, I'M NOT SURE THAT
DUMPING MISSILES ON DAMASCUSIS GOING TO DO MUCH TO
ALLEVIATED-- .
>> Stephen: TARGETED STRIKE,SMART BOMB.
>> THE PEOPLE SUFFERING AREIN REFUGEE CAMPS.
>> Stephen: DON'T BOMB THEREFUGEE CAMPS.
>> I'M WITH YOU.
>> Stephen: I WILL GO OUT ONA LIMB AND SAY THAT.
BUT YOU'VE GONE SO FAR AS TOSAY THAT YOU DONE THINK,
TELL ME IF I GET THIS WRONG,THAT ANY MILITARY
INTERVENTION BY AMERICA OVERTHE LAST 30 YEARS HAS BEEN
WORTHWHILE, THAT THEY'VEBEEN A WASTE.
>> BY AND LARGE, IF WE THINKABOUT THE WAR FOR THE MIDDLE
EAST, WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED INA WAR WITH THE MIDDLE EAST
FOR 30 YEARS.
>> Stephen: THIS DOESN'TINCLUDE VET NAM, VIETNAM WAS
WORTH IT.
>> NO, THAT WAS ALSO AWAISMTS I WAS THERE.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE THERE,OKAY.
>> BUT MORE RECENTLY OUREFFORTS TO USE OUR POWER TO
STABILIZE THE REGIONS, TODEMOCRATIZE THE REGION, TO
MAKE THE PEOPLE IN THEREGION LOVE US, IT AIN'T
WORKED.
AND SO TO IMAGINE THATOPENING UP A NEW FRONT ON
THIS WAR IN SYRIA, ANDYOU'RE-- TO THINK YOU'LL GET
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME, I JUSTDON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen: BUT DO WE WANTTHEM TO LOVE US.
DON'T WE ALSO WANT THEM TOFEAR US BECAUSE THEN THEY
WILL RESPECT US.
>> THESE ARE COUNTRIES FULLOF, BAD MEN, DOING BAD
THINGS, DON'T WE, YOU KNOW,ISN'T OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
SEND IN MILITARY FORCE WITHTHE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE I
DON'T KNOW?
>> WELL, IF OUR EFFORTSACTUALLY CAUSE THEM TO
RESPECT US OR EVEN TO FEARUS, THEN YOU COULD ARGUE
THAT MAYBE WHAT MAKES SENSEBUT THAT'S NOT BEEN THE
OUTCOME.
YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBERTHAT THE PEOPLE WE ARE
SENDING IN, THAT IS TO SAYOUR SOLDIERS PAY A HORRIFIC
COST FOR THE WARS THATWASHINGTON DECIDES WE MUST
FIGHT, 1 PERCENT BEARS THEBURDEN OF SERVICE AND
SACRIFICE.
99% OF THE REST OF US WATCHWHETHER THAT IS DEMOCRATIC,
WHETHER THAT IS MORAL.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK OURPRESENT MILITARY SYSTEM IS
DEMOCRATIC.
>> I THINK IT ISFUNDAMENTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC.
>> IF OUR MILITARY SYSTEM ISUNDEMOCRATIC, MY, YOU KNOW,
MY INSTINCT IS TO HAVE OURMILITARY INVADE OUR MILITARY
SYSTEM TO BRING DEMOCRACYHERE.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I THINK THE ANSWER IS TOHAVE THE PEOPLE IN-- TO
BRING DEM OCTOBERTEE-- DEMOCRACY TO OUR
MILITARY SYSTEM.
>> Stephen: ARE NEW FAVOR OFA DRAFT.
>> I'M IN FAVOR OF EVERY18-YEAR-OLD SHOULD OWE
SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY, THECOMMUNITY, SOME SERVE IN THE
MILITARY, OTHER SERVE INOTHER CAPACITY.
>> Stephen: OF THE PEOPLEWITHOUT JUST CLAPPED, HOW
MANY OF YOU ARE 18?
HA, HA, HA.
YEAH.
YAY!
MAKE THEM GO.
OKAY.
BUT THE PEOPLE WOULD FREAKOUT, RIGHT.
IF YOU DID THAT, IF YOUINTRODUCED LEGISLATION
SAYING AMERICANS MUST DO X,Y OR Z, DON'T YOU THINK ME
AND MY BUDDIES IN THE TEAPARTY ARE GOING TO SAY
GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE ANDTHE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT ARE
GOING TO SAY BUT THEY NEEDTO DO THE COMMUNITY SERVICE
TO GET THEM INTO COLLEGE.
I MEAN -->> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGHSELL.
THE WAY TO MAKE THE SALE ISTO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT OUR
CURRENT DEFINITION OFCITIZENSHIP IS INSIP I HAD,
IT'S THIN.
I AM OWED PREROGATIVE, IHAVE NO OBLIGATION.
WE NEED TO MOVE TO ACONCEPTION OF CITIZENSHIP
THAT PROVIDES PREROGATIVES,PRIVILEGES BUT ALSO ENTABLES
OBLIGATION.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE APROBLEM WITH WHAT YOU CALL
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICETYPES, WHAT DOW MEAN, PEOPLE
COME AND SAY THANK YOU FORYOUR SERVICE.
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU FORYOUR SERVICE.
(LAUGHTER)AND I KNOW YOU MEAN IT.
>> UH-HUH.
BUT I THINK THERE IS ASERIOUS QUESTION TO BE ASKED,
WHAT DOES THANKING SOLDIERSFOR THEIR SERVICE ENTAIL ON
THE PART OF THE REST OF US?
AND IT OUGHT TO ENTAILSOMETHING MORE THAN SIMPLY
SAYING THANKS OR PUTTING ABUMPER STICKER ON YOUR CAR.
>> BETTER YOU THAN ME.
>> WELL, I THINK TO SOMEDEGREE THAT'S THE
IMPLICATION, THE UNSPOKENIMPLICATION, BETTER YOU THAN
ME.
BUT IT OUGHT TO BE US.
THE ARMY OUGHT TO BE THEPEOPLE'S ARMY.
WE SHOULD REINSTITUTE ATRADITION OF CITIZEN
SOLDIERS.
>> Stephen: BUT IF EVERYONEWOULD GO INTO THE ARMY, I
THINK WE WOULD DO WHAT YOUARE SAYING AND NOT SEND KIDS
OFF TO WARS.
>> YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: MR. BACEVICH,
ANDREW BACEVICH, BREACH OFTRUST.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
