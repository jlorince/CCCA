>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,NATION. FOLKS
YOU CANNOT SPELL JUDGMENTWITHOUT "U" APPEARING BEFORE
"ME."
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER!
FIRST UP ON THE TIP WAGS, THEREIS A LOT OF HUNGER IN AMERICA.
IN 2012, MORE THAN ONE IN SEVENU.S. HOUSE HOLDS EXPERIENCED
FOOD INSECURITY.
THAT MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW WHERETHEIR NEXT MEAL WILL COME FROM.
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
JUST LAST NIGHT, I COULDN'TDECIDE WHETHER TO ORDER ITALIAN
OR CHINESE.
SO I SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE ANDORDERED AZERBAIJANI FOOD.
OF COURSE, BY THE TIME I GOT IT,MY TOYUG PLOV WAS SUPER-DRY.
SO, YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKEOUT THERE.
AND THOUGH I SUPPORT CONGRESS'$800 MILLION CUT TO OUR FOOD
STAMP PROGRAM THAT OBAMA SIGNEDTHIS YEAR, I'M NO MONSTER.
I WOULDN'T WANT ANY LEGITIMATELYHUNGRY PERSON TO STARVE.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO SOCIETY'STRULY UNDERPRIVILEGED -- YOUR
LOVEABLE SHOE SHINE BOYS, YOURPHOTOGENIC WAIFS, YOUR
PIE-CRAZED HOBOS.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY TOLEARN ABOUT A TREND THAT'S
TURNING ONE MAN'S TRASH INTOANOTHER MAN'S EDIBLE TRASH.
>> SALVAGE STORES LIKE THIS ONESPECIALIZE IN SELLING EXPIRED
FOODS AT GREATLY REDUCED PRICES.
75% OF THE GROCERY ITEMS SOLDHERE HAVE "BEST BY" OR "USED BY"
DATES THAT HAVE ALREADY EXPIRED.
DAMAGED, DENTED, DATED ORDISCOUNTED PRODUCTS THAT GROCERY
STORES WON'T SELL, LETTINGCONSUMERS GET CUH-RAZY
DISCOUNTS.
>> Stephen: YES, CUH-RAZYDISCOUNTS, SO POOR FAMILIES CAN
GET SUH-HUBSISTENCE NUTRITION.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OFTHE HAT TO SALVAGE STORES FOR
SHOWING THE "LEAST" WE CAN DOFOR THE HUNGRY IS LESS THAN ANY
OF US THOUGHT.
SURE, IT MIGHT SEEM SAD TO EATTHINGS THAT ARE EXPIRED OR
DAMAGED, BUT THIS IS AMERICA --IF YOU WORK HARD AND PLAY BY THE
RULES, YOU WILL EVENTUALLY EARNTHE DIGNITY OF AN INTACT BOX OF
TRISCUITS.
AND DON'T THINK OF IT AS EATINGDISCARDED FOOD.
THOSE SPAGHETTIOS ARE JUST BEINGSERVED AL-DENTED.
THEY'RE PERFECTLY "PROBABLY"SAFE.
SO YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA'SHUNGRY.
BECAUSE THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT'SGONNA GET.
WE JUST VOTED IN THE PEOPLE WHOWANT "MORE" CUTS.
TO THESE GUYS, EXPIRED PRUNESISN'T A QUESTIONABLE FOOD
PRODUCT -- IT'S THEIR VOTERBASE.
NEXT UP, NATION, YOU WILL RECALLTHAT LAST NIGHT I FINALLY MADE
MY PEACE WITH BEAR KIND BYGETTING ME A PIECE OF BEAR KIND.
HE TASTED LIKE PEPPERMINT ANDOLD SALMON.
SO I WAS SADDENED TO HEAR THATVOTERS IN MAINE HAVE PASSED A
BALLOT INITIATIVE PRESERVINGTHEIR RIGHT TO HUNT BLACK BEARS
WITH DAY-OLD JELLY DOUGHNUT,CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES, TWINKIES AND
WHITE BREAD.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN MAINE, YOU CAN HUNT BEARSUSING EXPIRED TWINKIES.
THOUGH IT MEANS YOU WILL HAVE TOWAIT 300 YEARS.
FOLKS, THIS IS DEPLORABLE ANDCRUEL TO MY NEW BEAR FRIENDS.
IF YOU LURE A BEAR WITH A BEARCLAW,
YOU'RE TEMPTING HIM INTOCANNIBALISM!
SO I'M GIVING A BIG WAG OF MYFINGER TO MAINE FOR ALLOWING THE
HUNTERS TO KILL BEARS USING JUNKFOOD.
BEWARE BEARS!
ASK NOT FOR WHOM THE DING DONGS,IT DONGS FOR THEE.
BESIDES, I JUST LEARNED THEREARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO COULD
USE THAT FOOD. FORGET GOING TOTHE SALVAGE STORES,
HUNGRY AMERICANS. MAINE'S JUSTGIVING AWAY JELLY DONUTS IN
THE WOODS! AND IF YOU GET CAUGHTIN A BEAR TRAP WHILE FORAGING
FOR STALE PASTRY, THAT'SJUST GOOD -- YOU CAN GNAW OFF
YOUR OWN LEG. THAT IS SOMEDELICIOUS DOUGHNUT-FED MEAT.
AND HERE'S A BONUS -- YOU WON'TGAIN AN OUNCE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
