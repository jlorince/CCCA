(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU PROBABLY ALREADYKNOW THIS BUT WE LIVE IN A
GOLDEN ERA OF DIGITAL TOYS.
MY FAVORITE ARE FITNESSTRACKERS LIKE THE FITBIT, I GOT
ONE RIGHT HERE, USES MOTIONSENSORS TO RECORD ALL OF MY
EXERCISE. AND EVIDENTLY I DIDNOT MOVE TODAY.
(LAUGHTER)LAST WEEK, LAST WEEK I
WANTED TO RUN A MARATHON SOI STRAPPED THIS BAD BOY TO A
PAINT SHAKER FOR ABOUT 20MINUTES.
FOR SOME REASON I'M STILLNOT LOSING WEIGHT G FIGURE.
FOR THE MOST EXCITINGPERSONAL INFO DEVICE IS
CALLED VESSYL, A BRAND-NEWDIGITAL CUP THAT TRACKS AND
IDENTIFIES ALL YOURBEVERAGES.
>> LET'S JUST SAY I HAVETHIS SODA ON THE TABLE.
AND THIS ONE IS AN ORANGECRUSH.
IF I WAS TO POUR MY SODAINTO THE VESSYL IT WOULD KNOW
THAT IT IS ORANGE CRUSH.
IT WOULD KNOW THAT THATTHERE IS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 70
CALORIES AND THEN I WOULDDRINK IT.
>> Stephen: WAIT.
(LAUGHTER)A DIGITAL CUP THAT CAN TELL
ME WHAT'S IN THE CUP AND HOWMANY CALORIES AND ALLOW ME
TO DRINK IT?
(LAUGHTER)THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION
WAS PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLEONLY ON THE CAN YOU JUST
POURED IT OUT OF.
(APPLAUSE)I MEAN THERE ARE SO
MANY-- THINK ABOUT IT THEREARE SO MANY TIMES WHEN
VESSYL BEVERAGE IDENTIFYINGTECHNOLOGY WILL COME IN
HANDY LIKE WHEN YOU ORDER ACOKE BUT IT TASTES KIND OF
LIKE A DIET COKE BUTYOU'RE NOT SURE.
AND PERHAPS OTHER TIMES.
AND VESSYL WILL MAKE SUREYOU GET YOUR DAILY
RECOMMENDED ALLOWANCE OFSILICON VALLEY BUZZWORDS.
>> THE VESSYL AUTOMATICALLYKNOWS WHAT'S INSIDE AND CAN
TRACK IN REALTIME THECONTENTS OF THE BEVERAGE.
IT TRACKS YOUR REALTIMEHYDRATION NEEDS BUT THE MAIN
GOAL IS TO HELP YOU MAKEHEALTHIER AND MORE INFORMED
DECISIONS IN REALTIME.
>> Stephen: FINALLY,DECISIONS IN REALTIME.
I'M SO TIRED OF MAKING UP MYMIND HOURS AFTER I'M DONE
DOING WHAT I WILL HAVEDECIDED.
AND THIS REALTIME WORKSQUICKLY.
JUST WATCH AS THIS GUY POURSA BEER FROM A CAN INTO
VESSYL WHICH CONFIRMS IT ISBEER.
IT'S LIKE HE'S NOT EVENDRINKING ALONE ANY MORE.
(LAUGHTER)AND--
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: AND ACCORDING TO
VESSYL'S CREATIVE DIRECTORTHAT CYLINDRICAL DESIGN WAS
NO ACCIDENT.
>> WE WANTED TO CREATESOMETHING BEAUTIFUL,
FUNCTIONAL, DURABLE AND ALSOSOMETHING THAT COULD LIVE
COMFORTABLY ONTABLETOPS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
IT HOLDS LIQUIDS AND CANSIT UPRIGHT ON A TABLE.
I MEAN IS THERE ANY ASPECT OFBEING A CUP THIS
CUP CAN'T DO?
AND NO WONDER BECAUSE VESSYLIS THE CULMINATION OF 7
YEARS OF WORK.
(LAUGHTER)SEVEN YEARS, OKAY.
LET'S PUT THAT INTOPERSPECTIVE.
THAT IS LONGER THAN THE TIMEBETWEEN JFK'S CALL TO PUT A
MAN ON THE MOON AND THEAPOLLO 11 LANDING.
AND REMEMBER WHEN ARMSTRONGLANDED HIS CUP HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS DRINKING TANG.
(LAUGHTER)NOT THAT INSPIRING NOW, IS IT?
NATION AS FAR AS I CANSEE THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO
VESSYL IS THAT IT WILL COSTALMOST $200 AND WON'T SHIP
UNTIL EARLY 2015.
EARLY 2015 AND THAT'S INREALTIME.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE EVEN ONCE VESSYL
DOES LAUNCH, IT STILL ONLYMONITORS YOUR BEVERAGE
INTAKE.
THAT'S ONLY HALF THEHYDRATION EQUATION.
WHAT ABOUT TRACKING YOUROUTPUT.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'MEXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE
PRE-RELEASE IDEA LAUNCH OF MYNEW PRODUCT TOYLYT.
IT'S THE FIRST-- THE FIRSTCUTTING EDGE E-RECEPTACLE
CAPABLE OF HANDLING ALL YOUR1.0 AND 2.0 DOWNLOADS IN
REALTIME.
(LAUGHTER)MOST IMPORTANTLY, TOYLET
SYNCS WITH YOUR iPHONE INTHAT YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR
iPHONE WHILE YOU'RE SITTINGON IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
