>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN
A BOOK CALLED THE DICTATOR'S
HANDBOOK.
WHY BAD BEHAVIOR IS ALMOST
ALWAYS GOOD POLITICS.
SOUNDS LIKE A GINGRICH FAN.
PLEASE WELCOME BRUCE BUENO
DEMESQUITA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, MR. BUENO DE MESQUITA.
WELCOME.
>> PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU A GAME
THEORIST, A PROFESSOR OF
POLITICS AND DIRECTOR OF THE
ALEXANDER HAMILTON CENTER OF
POLITICAL-- AT IT NYU, THE
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK THE
DICTATORS HANDBOOK.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen: FIRST OF ALL,
WHAT IS IN A DICTATOR'S
HANDBOOK.
DID YOU WRITE A BOOK FOR A
DICTATOR DOESN'T EVERY PAGE
SAY GREAT JOB, BOSS.
DON'T KILL ME.
>> NOT SO MUCH.
WHAT THE BOOK'S PAIN POINT
IS, IS THAT DICTATORS AND
DEMOCRATS AREN'T REALLY VERY
DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.
THEY WANT TO STAY IN POWER.
THEY WILL DO WHAT IT TAKES
TO STAY IN POWER.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ADMIT
OBAMA IS A DICTATOR.
>> HE WOULD LIKE TO BE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK
OBAMA WOULD LIKE TO BE A
DICTATOR.
>> I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT T
OF COURSE.
IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO
BE PRESIDENT IF YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO HAVE AN ELECTION, BE
POPULAR, GET VOTES IT WOULD
BE MUCH BET FERR YOU HAD 20
PEOPLE DECIDE HOW TO RUN THE
COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: AS A GAME
THEORIST YOU HAVE APPLIED
GAME THEORY TO POLITICAL
SCIENCE.
THE CIA'S OWN STUDY HAS
SHOWN THAT YOUR PREDICTIONS
ARE TWICE AS ACCURATE AS THE
CIA'S PREDICTIONS AS TO WHAT
WILL HAPPEN GEO POLITICALLY.
SOVIET UNION'S DEMISE YOU
PREDICTED.
KHMER ROUGE HOLDING
ELECTIONS, IRAN SEEKING
NUKES YOU PREDICTED.
HOW DID YOU DO IT?
WHAT IS GAME THEORY.
>> SO GAME THEORY IS A WAY
OF UNDERSTANDING HOW PEOPLE
COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER.
JUST LIKE PLAYING CHESS.
YOU LOOK AHEAD.
YOU WORK OUT WHAT THE OTHER
GUY IS GOING TO DO AND WAS'S
THE BEST MOVE I CAN MAKE IF
THAT IS WHAT HE WILL DO OR
IF THAT IS WHAT HE WILL DO.
HOW DO I STEER THE GAME TO
WORK OUT THE WAY I WANT IT
TO WORK OUT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY I
THROW OFF GUYS LIKE YOU BY
BURSTING INTO TEARS AND JUST
SWEEPING ALL THE PLAYERS OFF
AND GO INTO MY ROOM.
>> IN MY CONSULTING LIFE I
HAVE USED GETTING SOMEBODY
BURSTING INTO TEARS AS A
STRATEGY TO SOLVE A
LITIGATION, AS A MATTER OF
FACT.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YES, YEAH.
>> Stephen: SO HOW DO YOU
USE THAT TO FIND OUT WHAT IS
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE
SOVIET UNION.
>> SO YOU WHAT WANT TO DO IS
YOU WANT TO REALIZE PEOPLE
ARE SELF-INTERESTED.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY
STAND ON ISSUES THAT THEY
HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT.
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW FOCUSED
THEY ARE ON THOSE.
HOW MUCH TIME ARE THEY
WILLING TO PUT INTO REALLY
TRY TO INFLUENCE IT HOW MUCH
THEY VALUE GETTING AN
AGREEMENT EVEN IF IT'S NOT
WHAT THEY WANT AS OPPOSED TO
BEING RESOLVED, GOING DOWN
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY IN FAVOR
OF WHAT THEY WANT AND HOW
INFLUENCE COULD THEY BE.
IF YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS YOU
CAN WORK OUT PRETTY WELL,
WHAT PEOPLE'S INTERESTS ARE.
HOW THEY ANTICIPATE WHAT YOU
WILL DO, HOW YOU ANTICIPATE
WHAT THEY WILL DO AND HOW TO
SOLVE THE GAME.
>> Stephen: WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO NEXT?
>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, I
HAVE NO WISDOM.
I HAVE A COMPUTER MODEL SO
IF I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE
TIME WITH YOU I COULD
CONSTRUCT A DATA SET AND I
COULD PROBABLY WORK OUT WHAT
YOU ARE GOING TO DO, WHAT I
AM GOING TO DO IN RESPONSE,
WHAT YOUR AUDIENCE IS GOING
TO DO AND SO FORTH.
BUT-- .
>> Stephen: I PREDICT I'M
GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.
>> THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE
BUT NOT AN INTERESTING
PREDICTION THAT IS KIND OF
THE SUN WILL RISE IN THE
EAST AND SET IN THE WEST.
>> Stephen: WE DON'T KNOW.
>> WHICH QUESTION,.
>> Stephen: WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE SUN IS GOING TO DO
TOMORROW.
>> WELL, YOU'RE LESS
CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT THAN
MI.
>> Stephen: IT COULD BE
EXPLODING ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PLANET RIGHT NOW.
>> IT COULD BE WITH A VERY,
VERY, VERY LOW PROBABILITY.
I-- .
>> Stephen: THAT IS IN MY
COMPUTER MODEL.
>> THAT PARTICULAR ONE IS
NOT.
>> Stephen: NOT IN YOUR
COMPUTER MODEL.
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE
VARIABLES.
>> NOT ALL THE VARIABLES,
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHO DO DOW THIS
FOR.
>> WELL, I DO IT FOR PRIVATE
COMPANIES.
I DO IT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY.
I DO IT FOR MYSELF IN BUYING
A CAR AND SO FORTH.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAR DID YOU
BUY?
>> I JUST BOUGHT A BMW 528
XI.
>> Stephen: WOW, BECAUSE YOU
RAN THE PROBABILITY OF WHICH
CAR WOULD GET YOU LAID?
WHAT WOULD BE-- WHAT WAS THE
PROBABILITY THERE?
>> NO, I-- I WORKED OUT WHAT
THE STRATEGY WAS TO GET THE
SELLING, THE SELLER AT THE
OTHER END TO SELL IT AS
CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: AND DID IT WORK.
>> IT DID WORK.
>> Stephen: NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT IMPORTANT STUFF.
WE HAVE A BIG GAME GOING ON
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S CALLED THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHO, GINGRICH
TAKES SOUTH CAROLINA.
WHO FAKES THE WHOLE
ENCHILADA.
WITHOUT GETS NOMINATED.
>> GINGRICH GETS NOMINATED.
GINGRICH HAS A MUCH BETTER
STRATEGY THAN ROMNEY.
HE'S GOT MORE CHARISMA.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THAT
STRATEGY CALLED SCORCHED
EARTH?
>> IT IS SCORCHED EARTH
WHICH YOU MAY RECALL WORKED
REALLY WELL IN THE SOUTH.
>> Stephen: NOT FOR THE
SOUTHERNERS.
>> NOT SOME OF FOR THE
SOUTHERNERS AND IT IS GOING
TO WORK FOR GINGRICH.
HE'S TO THE GOING TO WIN THE
PRESIDENCY BUT HE IS GOING
TO GET THE NOMINATION THAT
IS NOT MODEL-- THAT IS
PERSONAL OPINION, MY OPINION
IS NOT WORTH MUCH.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER
PITTED YOUR SKILLS AGAINST
THE MAGIC EIGHT BALL?
>> FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.
MY STUDENTS YEARS AGO GAVE
ME A MAGIC EIGHT BALL AS AN
ALTERNATIVE TO THE GAME
THEORY MODEL.
>> Stephen: WHO WAS MORE
ACCURATE.
>> IT TURNS OUT IT'S CLOSE
BUT THE GAME THEORY MODEL
TENDS TO WIN.
>> Stephen: I WILL BUY ONE
AND TEST YOUR NEXT THEORY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: BRUCE BUENO DE
MESQUITA, THE BOOK IS THE
DICTATOR'S HANDBOOK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
