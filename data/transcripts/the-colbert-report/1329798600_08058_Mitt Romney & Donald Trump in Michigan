>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION F YOU READ THE NEWS
YOU KNOW THAT THE MICHIGAN
PRIMARY IS 1 WEEK FROM
TOMORROW AND ROMNEY CAMPAIGN
HAS MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS
DO-OR-DIE FOR MITT.
THE THING IS EVEN THOUGH
MICHIGAN IS HIS HOME STATE,
ROMNEY TRAILS RICK SANTORUM
BY FOUR POINTS IN THE LATEST
POLLS.
THAT HAS GOT TO BE A SHOCK
FOR MITT.
I MEAN THE WHOLE STATE IS
SHAPED LIKE A HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
UNFORTUNATELY, M ITT IS
BEING DOGGED BY HIS PAST.
>> THE AUTO BAILOUTS ARE
POPULAR IN THE STATE AND THE
STATE'S ECONOMY HAS BEEN
GROWING SINCE THE BAILOUTS
HAPPENED.
>> THIS PUTS GOVERNOR ROMNEY
IN AN AWKWARD POSITION
BECAUSE THREE AND A HALF
YEARS AGO HE WROTE AN
OPINION PIECE IN THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" TITLED LET
DETROIT GO BANKRUPT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A
COMPLIMENT.
HAVE YOU SEEN DETROIT?
BANKRUPT MIGHT BE AN
IMPROVEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW SO TO SAVE HIMSELF
ROMNEY'S BRINGING OUT THE
BIG GUNS.
SPECIFICALLY THE BIGGEST,
TANNEST, MOST LEATHERY GUN
OF THEM ALL, BILLIONAIRE,
FORMER CANDIDATE AND CURRENT
CANDIEDIAM DONALD TRUMP.
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU--
(APPLAUSE)
DELICIOUS.
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS
PHOTO HAS NOT BEEN DOCTORED
BECAUSE I WAS THERE WHEN IT
WAS TAKEN.
THAT'S NOT PHOTO SHOP.
THAT'S ACTUAL I'M IN FULL
MAKEUP AND THAT'S WHAT I
LOOK LIKE AND THAT'S WHAT HE
LOOKS LIKE.
WE MET WHEN TRUMP WAS A GUST
ON JIMMY FALLON'S SHOW THE
SAME NIGHT I WAS OVER THERE
LAST WEEK.
EVIDENTLY TO HONOR JIMMY'S
ACE CREAM, THE DONALD CAME
DISGUISED AS SALTED CARAMEL.
AND THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN IS
MAKING FULL USE OF TRUMP
SENDING HIM ON RADIO
INTERVIEWS ACROSS THE STATE.
TRUMP IS GIVING ROMNEY A
CRITICAL BOOST OF
CREDIBILITY, SERIOUSNESS AND
CLASS.
THE ONLY PROBLEM, THERE IS
ONLY ONE DONALD TO GO AROUND.
NOW YOU MAY RECALL WHEN
TRUMP HAD TO CANCEL HIS
DEBATE I STEPPED UP WITH MY
OWN SERIOUS CLASSY SOUTH
CAROLINA REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
WENT OFF WITHOUT A HITCH.
ALSO, WITHOUT A DEBATE.
WE HAD ANIMAL PLANET NAT GEO
WILD ALL LINED UP BUT DURING
REHEARSAL GWEN IFILL WAS
EATEN BY A PUMA.
THE POINT IS IF TRUMP IS
ROMNEY'S SURROGATE, I HEARBY
VOLUNTEER TO BE ROMNEY'S
SURROGATE SURROGATE.
LET'S DO IT.
JIMMY, TRUMP ME.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LISTEN UP, MITT ROMNEY, I
LOVE THIS MAN.
NUMBER ONE BEST, CLASSIEST
MITT EVER.
BETTER THAN MITT JAGGER.
THE GREATEST PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE OF OUR TIME OR OF
ANY TIME THIS WAS THE
RENAISSANCE HE'S LEONARDO,
HIS RUNNING MATE
MICHELANGELO BUT NO GAY
STUFF.
SPEAK OF WHICH, CELEBRITY
APPRENTICE, NEW SEASON, THE
BEST, YOU HAVE CHERYL TIEGS,
64, STILL PRIMO TAIL.
ARSENIO HALL, WOLF WOLF, LOU
FERRIGNO, ORIGINAL HULK, THE
GREENEST OF ALL HULKS.
A DEAD CIRCUS CHUMP, A PILE
OF LEGOS AND CLAY AIKIN.
VOICE OF AN ANGEL, ONCE IN A
GENERATION TALENT.
I'M GOING TO MAKE HIM SELL
HOGUIES IN A STRIP MALL.
ANYWAY, MICHIGAN, ROMNEY,
DONE.
AND FOLKS, SORRY, JIMMY, CAN
WE DETRUMP ME, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, THIS CAMPAIGN NEEDS
ME AND DONALD.
BECAUSE IT IS NO SECRET THAT
MITT ROMNEY IS HAVING
TROUBLE CONNECTING WITH THE
AVERAGE AMERICAN.
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SO
MUCH IN COMMON.
FOR INSTANCE THEY BOTH FEEL
AWKWARD AROUND MITT ROMNEY.
IN RECENT PRIMARIES COLORADO,
MINNESOTA AND MISSOURI MITT
GOT HIS ASS HANDED TO HIM BY
RICK SANTORUM WHICH IS
ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE
BECAUSE THE ASS IS A BODY
PART NEITHER OF THEM WILL
ADMIT EXISTS.
NOW FORTUNATELY MICHIGAN IS
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.
MITT WAS BORN THERE HE KNOWS
HOW TO APPEAL TO MICHIGAN
VOTERS.
>> A LITTLE HISTORY.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE.
I LOVE THIS STATE.
IT SEEMS RIGHT HERE.
TREES ARE THE RIGHT HEIGHTS.
I LIKE-- I LIKE SEEING-- I
LIKE SEEING THE LAKES.
I LOVE THE LAKE, JUST
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL HERE,
THE GREAT LAKES BUT ALSO ALL
THE LITTLE INLAND LAKES THAT
DOT THE PARTS OF MICHIGAN.
I LOVE CARS.
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE TRUE
HUMAN FEELINGS.
EXPRESSED BY A MAN WHO IS
DEFINITELY NOT JUST LISTING
THINGS CAN SEE OUT THE
WINDOW.
AND ROMNEY'S LOVE OF CARS IS
GENUINE AND DEEP.
>> I GREW UP TOTALLY IN LOVE
WITH CARS.
USED TO BE IN THE 50sEE AND
60s IF YOU SHOWED ME ONE
SCARE FOOT OF ALMOST ANY
PART OF A CAR I COULD TELL
YOU WHAT BRAND, THE MODEL
AND SO FORTH.
>> YES, YOU SHOW THAT MAN
ONE SQUARE FOOT OF ANY CAR
AND HE CAN IDENTIFY IT, THEN
STRAP A TERRIFIED DOG TO IT.
I HAVE NEVER--
(APPLAUSE)
HEY, BUDDY, HEY, LITTLE
BUDDY.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD ROMNEY
CONNECT SO VISCERALLY WITH
HIS FELLOW AMERICANS.
MITT WAS POSITIVELY POETIC
TALKING ABOUT MICHIGAN'S
POETIC WONDERS, PLAY THAT
AGAIN.
>> I LIKE SEEING THE LAKES,
I LOVE THE LAKES THERE IS
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL MERE
HERE, THE GREAT LAKES BUT
ALSO ALL THE LITTLE INLAND
LAKES THAT DOT THE PARTS OF
MICHIGAN.
>> Stephen: YES, EVERYONE
KNOWS ABOUT THE GREAT LAKES
BUT ONLY A LOCAL BOY TRULY
APPRECIATES MICHIGAN'S
MAJESTIC, THE PART.
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE LICENCE
PLATE, MICHIGAN, THE PART
STATE.
AND FOLKS, YOU WILL NOTICE
THAT MITT ROMNEY ADDRESSED
THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC TO
MICHIGAN'S UNEMPLOYED, TREE
HEIGHTS.
JIM.
>> I LOVE THIS STATE.
IT SEEMS RIGHT HERE.
TREES ARE THE RIGHT HEIGHTS.
>> Stephen: YES, MICHIGAN IS
VERY PROUD OF THEIR TREE
HEIGHT.
I MEAN LOOK AT THAT MAP EL,
TOTALLY, TOTALLY NAILED IT
HEIGHT WISE.
SHORT ENOUGH TO PUT A TREE
HOUSE IN, YET TALL HUFF
ENOUGH TO HANG YOURSELF WHEN
YOU LOSE YOUR HOME
