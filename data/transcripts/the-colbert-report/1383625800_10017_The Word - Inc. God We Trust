NATION AS A DEEPLYRELIGE-- RELIGIOUS MAN I
KNOW THE DEVIL TAKES MANYMORES BUT MOSTLY BARACK
OBAMA.
AND THERE IS YET ANOTHERSERIOUS SIDE EFFECT OF
BARACKOCARE, LOSS OFRELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
>> ONE KEY CONCERN IS THEHHS CONTRACEPTION PAN DATE
WHICH WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERSTO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES HAVE
ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCECOVERAGE THAT PROVIDES COST
FREE CONTRACEPTION.
>> OPPONENTS OF THE PAN DATESAY IT'S GOING TO MAKE
BUSINESS OWNERS VIOLATETHEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
BY FORCING THEM TO PROVIDEINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR
EMPLOYEES THAT INCLUDES ALLTYPES OF BIRTH CONTROL.
>> Stephen: YUP, MANDATEDBIRTH CONTROL.
JUST THE FIRST STEP INOBAMA'S PLAN TO-- PLAN TO
GET THE WHOLE COUNTRY HOOKEDON THE PILL.
I THINK THEY ARE SLIPPINGINTO THE DRINKING WATER
ALREADY BECAUSE I KNOW IHAVE BEEN HAVING SOME VERY
LIGHT PERIODS AM I'M NOTSAYING NOTHING, BUT PRETTY
LIGHT.
NOW SOME PEOPLE, SOME PEOPLEARE DEMANDING THEIR RIGHTS
BUT SOME LEGAL PERSONSDIDN'T HAVE-- DON'T HAVE
MOUTHS.
THEY'RE CALLED CORPORATIONS.
AND THEIR CRUSADE BRINGS USTO TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IN GOD WE TRUST.
FOLKS, ONE OF THE VICTIMS OFMANDATED CONTRACEPTION IS
HOBBY LOBBY WITH.
OVER 500 RETAIL LOCATIONSTHEY ARE THE NATION'S
LARGEST CRAFT SUPPLYBUSINESS.
NOW FOLKS, THE OWNERS, THEOWNERS OF HOBBY LOBBY, THE
GREEN FAMILY, ARE DEVOUTCHRISTIANS WHO BELIEVE THAT
LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION.
AND COINCIDENTALLY THEIRBUSINESS, HOBBY LOBBY, ALSO
BELIEVES LIFE BEGINS ATCONCEPTION.
AND WHILE, WHILE HOBBY LOBBYIS HAPPY TO SELL RICK RACK
AND GLITTER GLUE ONE THINGIS NOT FOR SALE.
IT'S VALUE.
SO HOBBY LOBBY'S LAWYERSHOBBY LOBBIES THE COURT FOR
A RELIGIOUS EXCEPTION-- EXEMPTION FOR
MANDATED CONTRACEPTIONARGUING THE CORPORATION
ITSELF IS ENTITLED TO FREEEXERCISE OF RELIGION.
OF COURSE RULINGS LIKECITIZENS UNITED HAVE
ESTABLISHED THATCORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE WITH
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TOFREEDOM OF SPEECH.
SO WHY NOT RELIGION.
AND ALREADY A FEDERALAPPEALS COURT AGREED RULING
CORPORATIONS CAN BE PERSONS,EXERCISING RELIGION.
THAT'S RIGHT.
A CORPORATION CAN HAVERELIGIOUS BELIEFS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS-- (LAUGHTER)
FOLKS-- THAT FEELS RIGHT,DOESN'T IT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: YES.
YES.
THAT FEELS RIGHT TOEVERYBODY.
BECAUSE CORPORATIONSSTRUGGLE WITH THE SAME
EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS WE ALLDO.
AND AMERICA WAS FOUNDED,THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEALS OF RELIGIOUSLIBERTY FOR ALL PEOPLE, BE
THEY CHRISTIAN, JEWISH,BUDDHIST OR LIMITED
LIABILITY FORMED UNDERSUBCHAPTER S OF THE UNITED
STATES TAX CODE.
THEREFORE-- THEREFORE THECORPORATE PERSON KNOWN AS
HOBBY LOBBY SHOULD NOT BEFORCED TO PROVIDE
CONTRACEPTION BECAUSE IT ISACCEPTED JESUS INTO ITS
HEARTS AND HAS BEEN SAVED.
AND FOLKS-- THERE ARE SOMANY OTHER CORPORATIONS WHO
PRACTICE RELIGION.
I MEAN OFF THE TOP OF MYHEAD THERE IS QUAKER OATS,
THERE IS CHRIST-LER.
THERE IS CHURCH'S CHICKENAND VIRGIN, WHICH OF COURSE
WORSHIPS A BIZARRE GOATHEADED GOD.
SO I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE ITIS TIME WE ACKNOWLEDGED THE
DEEP FAITH HELD BY ALL OFOUR CORPORATE CITIZEN THOSE
MATTER WHAT FAITH THEY ARE.
HINDUS BELIEVE INREINCARNATION SO WHY SHOULD
A HINDU CORPORATION BEFORCED TO FOLLOW WORKPLACE
SAFETY LAWS.
IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT, THEWORKER WILL JUST COME BACK
AS AN ANT.
AND-- (LAUGHTER)
REMEMBER, BUDDHISTS REJECTTHE MATERIAL WORLD.
WHY SHOULD A BUDDHISTCORPORATION BE FORCED TO PAY
ANYONE MONEY.
AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEIRDEEPLY HELD BELIEFS, WE
ALLOW NATIVE AMERICANS TOLEGALLY DROP PEYOTE,
THEREFORE WE SHOULD A LACOKE INDUSTRIES TO LEGALLY
DROP ACID IN OUR RIVERS.
NOW REMEMBER, REMEMBER,FOLKS, THE PURPOSE OF
RELIGION IS TO ANSWER THEULTIMATE QUESTION, ARE WE IN
CONTROL OR IS THERE SOMEGREATER FORCE PULLING THE
STRINGS.
AND IF THE COURTS RULE THATCORPORATIONS HAVE THE SAME
RELIGIOUS RIGHTS THAT WEHUMANS DO, I THINK WE'LL
HAVE OUR ANSWER.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
