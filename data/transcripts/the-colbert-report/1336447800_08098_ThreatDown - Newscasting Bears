>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, BE AFRAID, BE A TEENY TINNY BIT AFRAID.
THIS IS THE MINITHREATDOWN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NATION, A CHILLING STORY FROM WNEP SCRANTON'S WEATHER NEWS LEADER.
I ALWAYS GET MY WEATHER FROM WNEP BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A BACKYARD WEATHER CENTER.
I MEAN WHY WOULD I TRUST SOMEONE WHO'S INSIDE TO TELL ME WHAT IT'S LIKE OUTSIDE.
HE'S GOT NO SKIN IN THE GAME.
BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AS ANCHOR TRISH HARTMAN AND SCOTT SHAFFER WERE THROWING
TO METEOROLOGIST CURT AARON IN THE BACKYARD WEATHER CENTER.
JIM.
>> CURT AARON IS OUT IN THE BACKYARD TO GIVE US OUR FORECAST.
TOLD CURT IS NOT IN THE BACKYARD BECAUSE THERE ARE BEARINGS OUTSIDENESS HE COMING INSIDE.
>> THIS IS LIVE VIDEO FROM THE BACKYARD RIGHT NOW.
>> NO WAY.
SO THIS IS WHY CURT AARON IS NOT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
>> I DON'T BLAME HIM.
>> THERE ARE FOUR BEARS.
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK THERE.
THAT WAS A BIG BEAR.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT FORECAST WAS PARTLY GRIZZLY WITH A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION AND CURT AARON'S PANTS.
WHICH BRINGS TO US THE NUMBER ONE THREAT IN AMERICA,
NEWSCASTING BEARS.
FOLKS, THESE GODLESS KILLING MACHINES ARE COMING FOR OUR BROADCASTING JOBS.
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT CNN HAS A WOLF AND FOX NEWS HAS A BADGER.
THESE THREAT BEARS WILL MAKE PERFECT PUNDITS BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK WITH THEIR GUTS
AND ARE PRONE TO SUDDEN FITS OF RAGE.
AND SURE BEARS GET THEIR HEADS STUCK IN THE OCCASIONAL HONEY JAR BUT SO DOES STEVE DOOCY.
THESE BEARS WON'T STOP UNTIL THEY GET THEIR JAWS ON A NEWSMAN.
SO TO KEEP SAFE I WILL BE DOING MY SHOW SUSPENDED FROM A TREE.
AND TO MY FELLOW NEWSCASTERS OUT THERE, I SAY WATCH YOUR BACK FELLOWS, AND FOR GOD'S
SAKES, STAY
