BUILDING AFTER.
JIM?
>> STEPHEN COLBERT PRESENTS --[ MUSIC ]
-- PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER.
THE COLBERT INTERVIEW.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
STEPHEN T. COLBERT NATIONALMUSEUM OF
JIMMY CARTER-ING.
JAMES EARL JONES CARTER, JR. WASBORN OCTOBER 1, 1924 IN PLAINS,
GEORGIA, THE ELDEST OF FOURCHILDREN TO BESSIE LILLIAN GORDY
AND JAMES EARL CARTER, APROMINENT PEANUT FARMER, WHICH
IS WHY TO THIS DAYCARTER MUST WEAR A LABEL
READING:"WARNING: MANUFACTURED IN A
FACILITY THATPROCESSES PEANUTS."
AFTER GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL,CARTER ATTENDED THE U.S.  NAVAL
ACADEMY AND APPLIED TO WORK ONTHE FLEDGLING NUCLEAR SUBMARINE
PROGRAM.
IN 1952, HE DASHED INTO AMALFUNCTIONING NUCLEAR
REACTOR TO HELP SHUT IT DOWN.
AFTERWARDS, HE CELEBRATED HISSUCCESS BY DESTROYING TOKYO.
AFTER HIS FATHER PASSED AWAY IN1953, CARTER RETURNED HOME TO
RUN THE FAMILY BUSINESS, ENDINGA PROMISING NAVAL CAREER.
SADLY, HE NEVER ROSE ABOVE THERANK OF "COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF."
CARTER'S FAMILY THEN FELL ONHARD TIMES AND BRIEFLY LIVED IN
A GEORGIA HOUSING PROJECT,MAKING HIM THE ONLY PRESIDENT TO
HAVE "LIVED" IN PUBLICHOUSING...
OTHER THAN ALL OF THEM.
IN 1970, CARTER WAS ELECTEDGOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.
DID SOME STUFF, PROBABLY.
THEN, IN 1976, CARTER BECAME THEFIRST PRESIDENT SINCE ZACHARY
TAYLOR ELECTED FROM THE DEEPSOUTH.
NATURALLY, HE WAS SWORN IN ON ACHICKEN-FRIED BIBLE.
IN 1977, CARTER GAVE AWAY "OUR"CANAL TO SOME PLACE CALLED
PANAMA, ENRAGING A MAN I LIKE TOCALL RONALD REAGAN.
RONALD WILSON REAGAN WAS BORN IN19 --
WHAT'S THAT?
WRONG LIBRARY?
OKAY.
I'M SORRY.
LET'S GET HIM ON.
OKAY.
IN 1979, PRESIDENT CARTERNEGOTIATED THE
CAMP DAVID ACCORDS, WHICHBROUGHT PEACE BETWEEN EGYPT AND
ISRAEL, MARKING A PERIOD OFTRANQUILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
THAT LASTED ALMOST 20 MINUTES.
DURING THE OIL CRISIS, CARTERSET AN ENERGY CONSERVATION
EXAMPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE,WHERE HE TURNED DOWN THE
THERMOSTATSWORE SWEATERS TO KEEP WARM,
INSTALLED SOLAR PANELS ON THEROOF AND ATTACHED A
WINDMILL TO WALTER MONDALE.
1979 ALSO MARKED THE BEGINNINGOF THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS, WHEN
OUR TEHRAN EMBASSY WAS STORMED,AND 52 AMERICANS WERE HELD
HOSTAGE, RESULTING IN A LOWAPPROVAL RATING FOR CARTER, AND
AN EVEN LOWER TRIP ADVISORRATING FOR THE  IRANIAN EMBASSY.
RESCUE ATTEMPTS FAILED, BECAUSE,SADLY, AT THE TIME, BEN AFFLECK
WAS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]ON JULY 15TH 1979, JIMMY CARTER
GAVE HISINFAMOUS "MALAISE" SPEECH,
WHICH, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,DIDN'T
ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE WORD"MALAISE."
JUST LIKE HOW DURING F.D.R.'SFIRESIDE CHATS, HE WASN'T
ACTUALLY ON FIRE.
NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT.
IN 1980, CARTER DEFEATED TEDKENNEDY IN A HARD-FOUGHT
PRIMARY, AND WENT ON TO WIN THEGREATEST TITLE OF ALL, THE MAN
WHO LOST TO RONALD REAGAN.
RONALD WILSON REAGAN WAS BORN INTAMPICO, ILLINOIS --
WHAT?
STILL NOT DOING REAGAN?
FINE.
DEAL'S A DEAL.
AFTER HIS LOSS TO REAGAN,PRESIDENT CARTER BECAME "FORMER"
PRESIDENT CARTER, A TITLE HE HASSUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED FOR 33
YEARS, INCLUDING A 1987 SPLITDECISION AGAINST HECTOR "MACHO"
CAMACHO.
I LOST A "LOT" OF MONEY ON THAT.
WITHIN YEARS OF LEAVING OFFICE,JIMMY CARTER FOUNDED THE CARTER
CENTER, A HUMANITARIANORGANIZATION WHICH HAS FOUGHT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISEASEPREVENTION.
AND FOR THREE DECADES, HE HASWORKED WITH  HABITAT FOR
HUMANITY, BUILDING HOUSES FORTHE POOR ALL OVER THE WORLD --
IN AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO LAUNCHHIS HGTV SHOW,  "NAIL TO THE
CHIEF."
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]IN 2002, JIMMY CARTER WAS
AWARDED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,MAKING HIM THE ONLY NATIVE
GEORGIAN BESIDES MARTIN LUTHERKING TO HAVE WON THE
AWARD.
BUT GOOD LUCK NEXT YEAR.
HULK HOGAN.
IN SUMMATION, WHEN TALKING ABOUTOUR NATION'S PRESIDENTS, HISTORY
WILL RECOGNIZE JIMMY CARTER WASONE OF THEM.
CONGRATULATIONS, SIR.
BACK TO YOU, STEPHEN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL SIT DOWNWITH THE 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WHO'S THAT?
YOU'LL HAVE TO STICK AROUND TOFIND OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
