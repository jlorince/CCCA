>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, NATION, I HAVE
ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT A NEWS
ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE A
LEAN ORGANIZATION.
THAT'S WHY I DO THIS SHOW
SINGLE-HANDEDLY, ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, MICHAEL STIPE.
>> HEY-HO!
>> Stephen: AND NOW-- GOOD
MAN.
AND NOW THE LAYOFF BUG HAS
BITTEN MY COLLEAGUES OVER AT
CABLE NEWS NETWORK, THE
CABLE NEWS NETWORK.
RECENTLY CNN LAID OFF 50
STAFF MEMBERS, NOBODY
IMPORTANT, JUST EDITORS AND
PHOTO JOURNALISTS.
BECAUSE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN
DESKTOP EDITING AND USER
GENERATED CONTENT AND SOCIAL
MEDIA HAVE MADE SOME EDITING
AND PHOTO JOURNALISM
POSITIONS REDUNDANT.
YOU SEE, CNN DOESN'T NEED AS
MANY EDITORS AND PHOTO
JOURNALISTS BECAUSE THEY
HAVE IREPORTS.
FOOTAGE, COMMENTARY AND
ARTICLES THAT CNN VIEWERS
SELF-PRODUCE AND THEN
UPLOAD.
IT SI A BRILLIANT IDEA.
WHY BUY THE COW WHEN YOU CAN
HAVE IT SHAKEILY VIDEOTAPE
ITS OWN MILK FOR FREE.
NOW LAST WEEK CNN RELAUNCHED
IREPORT AS A SOCIAL NETWORK,
COMPLETE WITH AN ASSIGNMENT
DESK WHERE YOU CAN GO TO
FIND OUT WHAT STORIES CNN
WANTS YOU TO COVER.
I CERTAINLY HOPE SOME
REPORTS ON THAT PICKET FENCE
THAT IS SO FUN TO PAINT.
BEST OF ALL, I REPORTERS DO
NOT GET PAID.
THEY GET SOMETHING EVEN
BETTER.
BADGES.
WHICH I ASSUME ARE
REDEEMABLE FOR FOOD AND
RENT.
PLUS YOU GET NOTHING ELSE.
IT'S LIKE AN INTERNSHIP, IF
YOU WORK FOR FREE, PUTTING
YOUR TIME AND YOUR WORK IS
GOOD ENOUGH, MAYBE ONE DAY
YOU COULD BE LAID OFF BY
CNN.
NOW IREPORT CUTS THROUGH THE
MEDIA FILTER TO REPORT THE
NEWS THAT PEOPLE IN THE REAL
WORLD ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT
LIKE WHAT JO JO-GAL MADE FOR
DINNER LAST NIGHT,
UNNARRATED VACATION FOOTAGE,
LATE-BREAKING TORTOISE
REPORT, INVESTIGATIVE
COVERAGE OF COMPUTERS
SHOWING YOUTUBE VIDEOS,
PHOTOS WITHOUT ANY
EXPLANATIONS, THE WEATHER
AND A LITTLE GIRL'S BACKYARD
AND THE MINDLESS DRONES OF A
HOMELESS MAN.
>> I WAS AT GUANTANAMO IN
THE EARLY 09s WHEN THE VICE
PRESIDENT, DICK CHENEY SAID
TO ME THE OTHER DAY, IT IS
THE TROPIC, IT IS A LOVELY
PLACE.
HE HAS A POINT STATEMENT
LOVELY PLACE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS CLEARLY,
CLEARLY THIS, LOOK HOW MUCH
THEY LOVE IT.
CLEARLY THIS IS THE FUTURE
OF NEWS.
AND DADDY WANTS IN.
SO TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO
ANNOUNCE STEPHEN COLBERT'S
ME-REPORTS.
AN ARMY OF ME-REPORTERS
COVERING THE HOTTEST STORIES
OF THE DAY FROM AN
UNCOMPENSATED WORKERS POINT
OF VIEW.
FOR MORE LET'S HEAD OVER TO
THE ME REPORTER 6700.
WELCOME TO THE ME REPORT
6700, WHERE FIELD REPORTER
MEANS A HANDI CAM DUCT TAPED
TO YOUR DOG.
AS YOU CAN SEE, RIGHT NOW WE
HAVE GOT DOZENS AND DOZENS
OF ME REPORTERS ALL OVER
AMERICA.
LET'S CHECK IN ON SOME OF
OUR TOP STORIES RIGHT HERE
WE HAVE-- I'M SORRY, THAT IS
FOOTAGE OF MY COLONOSCOPY,
OKAY.
LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE, RIGHT
UP OVER HERE.
WE HAVE-- BOB!
BOB!
>> Stephen: IT APPEARS TO BE
A GOAT YELLING THE WORD BOB.
SO THAT'S HAPPENING.
LET'S SEE SOMETHING ELSE.
THAT IS A SCREENSAVER, OKAY.
I TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S GO
OUT TO ME-REPORTER TERRY
WARD WITH A RUNDOWN OF THE
HEADLINES EVERYONE WILL BE
TALKING ABOUT TOMORROW IN
VIDEOS THEY MAKE ME FOR
FREE.
TERRY.
>> HEY, STEPHEN, HERE ARE
THE STORIES THAT WE'RE
FOLLOWING IN THE SITUATION
BUS STOP.
OUR TOP STORY, NUMBER 11 BUS
IS LATE AGAIN.
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
HEADLINES.
(LAUGHTER)
THERE THEY ARE, OCCUPIERS
ARE NOT CUT FROM THE SAME
CLOTH.
I ASSUME THAT'S A METAPHOR
OTHERWISE THERE HAS BEEN
SOME HORRIFIC VIOLENCE.
IN OTHER BREAKING NEWS,
HOLIDAY RETAIL SALES TOP
RECORDS.
AND THOSE RECORDS ARE BELOW
THE FOLD SO WE WILL HAVE
MORE DETAILS ON THAT STORY
AS SOMEONE COMES BY WITH
SOME QUARTERS.
WHERE IS THAT BUS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
TERRY.
FOR THAT ABSOLUTELY FREE
REPORT WHICH FOR THE PRICE
WAS EXCELLENT.
AND BRAVO CNN FOR GETTING
RID OF ALL THOSE PESKY
PROFESSIONALS.
HOPEFULLY THIS BOLD MOVE
WILL HELP YOU GET RID OF
YOUR REMAINING VIEWERS.
