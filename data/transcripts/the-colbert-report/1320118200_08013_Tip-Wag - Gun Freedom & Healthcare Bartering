(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, ONCE AGAIN AT THE
"REPORT" IT IS TIME FOR SHOW AND
TELL.
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU STUFF AND
TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
, A
BIG TIP OF MY HAD TO WISCONSIN
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER FOR
BRINGING A NEW FREEDOM TO
AMERICA'S DAIRYLAND.
>> GOVERNOR WALKER'S
ADMINISTRATION WILL ALLOW PEOPLE
WITH TRAINING AND CONCEALED
CARRY PERMITS TO BRING CONCEALED
WEAPONS INTO STATE CAPITAL.
>> Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT!
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IN
THIS COUNTRY AND LIKE IT OR NOT,
WISCONSIN IS STILL PART OF THIS
COUNTRY.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I PROMISE THIS IS NOT...
THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU'LL SEE
IMAGES OF GUNFIRE IN THE
STATEHOUSE, BECAUSE WHILE GUNS
ARE ALLOWED, CAMERAS ARE NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK GOD.
CAMERAS ARE DANGEROUS.
WITH NO WAITING PERIOD OR
BACKGROUND CHECK, ANY WHACK JOB
COULD JUST STROLL INTO A
WAL-MART AND WALK OUT WITH A
SEMIAUTOMATIC.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR YEARS, I'VE BEEN PRESSING
FOR STRICTER REGULATIONS ON
CAMERAS, ESPECIALLY AROUND OUR
ELECTED OFFICIALS.
TOO MANY POLITICAL LIVES HAVE
BEEN CUT SHORT BY SOME CRAZED
SHOOTER.
AND IT'S EVEN SADDER WHEN THEY
SHOOT THEMSELVES.
NEXT, FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS I
AM NO FAN OF OBAMACARE.
NORMALLY I'D GET ANGRIER ABOUT
IT BUT I HAVE HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE AND MY CO-PAYS ARE
THROUGH THE ROOF.
(LAUGHTER)
SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO TRUE
NORTH, A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IN
FALMOUTH, MAINE, THAT OFFERS THE
SIMPLEST WAY FOR LOW INCOME
PATIENTS TO GET THE CARE THEY
NEED.
>> TRUE NORTH HAS ABOUT 33
PATIENTS WHO PAY WITH TIME
INSTEAD OF MONEY.
THEY TRADE THE TIME THEY'VE
SPENT DOING SOME KIND OF SERVICE
FOR TIME WITH THE DOCTOR.
>> YOU CAN GET GUITAR LESSONS
FOR YOUR KID OR DRIVING YOU TO
THE AIRPORT.
>> Stephen: PERFECT.
JUST TELL YOUR KID "THIS IS
MR. PETERSON, HE'S GOING TO
TEACH YOU GUITAR AND THAT ODD
SMELL IS HIS PERFORATED COLON."
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
"KEEP SOME PRESSURE ON IT."
IT'S A SAD STORY, I REALIZE.
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE PLAYING SOME
VERY SAD SONGS.
BUT THIS IS BETTER THAN
OBAMACARE.
THE TRUE NORTH BARTER PROGRAM IS
CURRENTLY FOR CLINICAL SERVICES
BUT I SAY THERE'S NO REASON IT
COULDN'T WORK FOR MORE SERIOUS
CARE.
ABOUT TO GO INTO LABOR?
HOW ARE YOU AT RETARRING A ROOF.
(LAUGHTER)
AND YOU'RE NOT OFF THE HOOK,
COMA PATIENTS.
IF YOU'VE GOT TIME TO LIEBE,
YOU'VE GOT TIME TO LEAN.
ESPECIALLY ONCE YOU PUT YOU IN
SOME SUPERABSORBENT SWIFFER
ROBES.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
IS A COMA PATIENT, AN OLD MAN
WITH A FEEDING TUBE BUT HEAVEN
FORBID YOU MAKE ONE PERFORATED
COLON REFERENCE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN A
DOCTOR CAN SAY "THE BAD NEWS IS
YOU HAVE THREE WEEKS TO LIVE,
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT'S JUST
