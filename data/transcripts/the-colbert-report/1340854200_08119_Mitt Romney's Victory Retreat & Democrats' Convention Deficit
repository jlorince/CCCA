>> Stephen:  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, YOU JUST HAVE NO IDEA.
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, GOOD TO HAVE I WITH US.
FOLKS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT KIND OF ENERGY MEANS TO ME.
I JUST-- I JUST WANT TO CRAWL INTO YOUR LAP AND STROKE YOUR HAIR.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE ) NATION, THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ONLY FOUR MONTHS AWAY.
IT IS TIME FOR THE CANDIDATES TO PUT THEIR MONEY WITH THEIR MOUTH IS, AND EVERY OTHER ORIFICES
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF MONEY.
ESPECIALLY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND, ALL THE BIG G.O.P. DONORS WERE AT DEER VALLEY RESORT IN UTAH AT THE
FIRST NATIONAL ROMNEY VICTORY LEADERSHIP RETREAT.
YOU'VE GOT TO RESPECT THAT SORT OF CONFIDENCE.
( LAUGHTER ).
THE MAN HAS NOT EVEN OFFICIALLY BEEN NOMINATED YET, AND HE'S CELEBRATING VICTORY.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS WEEKEND'S MITT ROMNEY SECOND INAUGURATION
HO-DOWN AND PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY FUND-RAISER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE VICTORY RETREAT WAS A REWARD FOR BIG DONORS WHO HAD
CONTRIBUTED $50,000 OR RAISED $250,000 FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
NO WORD YET ON WHERE MITT WILL HOST HIS SMALL DONORS BUT GIVEN
THE NUMBER OF THEM, I'M GUESSING THE BACK OF A TANDEM BIKE.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW, SMALL THINGS MAY BE SUNNY WITH A CHANCE OF CASH FOR THE G.O.P.
THE FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF FIGHTING A SEAGULL
FOR HALF A HOT DOG BUN.
>> WOES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION KEEP PILING UP.
FACED WITH A $27 MILLION FUND-RAISING SHORTFALL THE HOST COMMITTEE PULLED THE PLUG ON
USING THE SPEEDWAY FOR THE KICKOFF.
>> THERE ARE REPORTS THEY WILL HAVE TO DOWNSIZE THEIR CONVENTION ACTIVITIES.
>> HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THE CONVENTION WILL BE A SUCCESS IN CHARLOTTE?
>> WE HAVEN'T RAISED ENOUGH MONEY YET, BUT WE WILL, AND IT WON'T BE A DISASTER.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  "IT WON'T BE A DISASTER," THE MOST STIRRING
DEMOCRATIC RALLYING CRY SINCE F.D.R.'S "WE HAVE NOTHING TO
FEAR BUT..." THEY DON'T TEACH YOU THAT IN HISTORY CLASS.
DEMOCRATS, OF COURSE, HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR THIS SHORTFALL BECAUSE THEY REFUSED
ALL CORPORATE MONEY FOR THE CONVENTION, AND THEY HAVE TRIED TO RAISE TAXES ON THE TOP 1%.
SO I GUESS YOU DON'T NEED OUR MONEY, DEMOCRATS.
( LAUGHTER ) WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG AND ASK YOUR LITTLE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH.
I'M SURE IF THEY REACH DEEP DOWN INTO THEIR COUCH CUSHIONS,
THEY'LL FIND YOUR $27 MILLION.
( LAUGHTER ) AND IF NOT, MAYBE-- MAYBE A TIP JAR ON THE PRETTY DESK THAT
SAYS, "CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, OH, OH, OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL EVEN DO MY PART.
HERE WE GO.
OH, NO, THIS IS FOR MY DIRTY,
DIRTY SUPERPAC.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SULLY YOUR
