(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US.
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT
IS MUSIC TO MY EAR.
NATION, YOON ABOUT YOU, BUT I
COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT
ALL THE OPTIONS IN THE G.O.P.
PRESIDENTIAL FIELD.
(LAUGHTER)
THESE CANDIDATES ARE LIKE THE
PERFECT APPETIZER SAMPLER
PLATTER.
YOU'VE GOT PIZZA BITES, CRAZY
BREAD, BOILED POTATO, TEXAS
TOAST, FOIE GRAS, IMITATION FOIE
GRAS, UNINSPECTED SQUIRREL JERKY
ALL WITH THE SANTORUM DIPPING
SAUCE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SPEAKING OF BEING COMPLETELY
SATISFIED WITH THE REPUBLICAN
SLATE OF CANDIDATES, CHRIS
CHRISTIE 2012!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
THIS GUY GETTING IN THE RACE!
>> I'D LOVE IT.
WE'D ALL LOVE IT IF CHRIS
CHRISTIE GOT IN THE RACE.
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE IS EXCITING.
>> HE'S EXCITING.
>> REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING FOR A
DOSE OF CHARISMA, A JOLT OF
ENERGY.
CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS BETH THOSE IN
SPADES.
>> Stephen: SPADES, BY THE WAY,
IS NOT THE NAME OF CHRISTIE'S
HUNTING CAMP.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, CHRISTIE MADE A BIG
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS AFTERNOON.
I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M GOING TO PRETEND HE
ANNOUNCED HE'S THE NEW IPHONE.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE, FOLKS, I HAVE LOVED
THIS BEAUTIFUL, DELICATE DANCE
BETWEEN CHRISTIE AND THE MEDIA.
THE MEDIA STARTS IT BY
SPECULATING THAT HE'S RUNNING
AND THEN CHRISTIE TEASES US BY
BEING COY LIKE THIS.
>> I AM NOT GOING TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT IN 2012.
I'M 100% CERTAIN I'M NOT GOING
TO RUN.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT IN
2012.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO SHORT OF
SUICIDE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE I'M
NOT RUNNING?
APPARENTLY I ACTUALLY IS TO
COMMIT SUICIDE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SEE HOW HE
LEFT THE DOOR OPEN THERE?
(LAUGHTER)
LAST TIME I CHECKED, HE'S NOT
DEAD!
AND SO THE CHRISTIE FEVER GETS
HOTTER AND HOTTER NO MATTER HOW
MANY TIMES THE GOVERNOR SAID HE
WASN'T RUNNING-- WHILE MAKING
NATIONAL POLICY SPEECHES IN KEY
PRIMARY STATES.
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE SAYING
YOU'RE NOT ON DRUGS WHILE LIKING
WALL PAPER TO TASTE ITS
HAPPINESS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, LAST WEEK THE MEDIA REACHED
THAT ELUSIVE MOMENT OF
SPECULATION WHERE CHRISTIE WAS
BOTH IN AND OUT-- IN THE SAME
SENTENCE.
>> CHRISTIE'S BROTHER TOLD THE
NEW JERSEY NEWSPAPER HE IS SURE
THE GOVERNOR IS NOT RUNNING BUT
A CLOSE ADVISOR TO CHRISTIE
TELLS CNN THE STORM OF
SPECULATION IS INCREDIBLE BUT
THIS IS A DECISION THAT "WILL
COME FROM CHRIS CHRISTIE ON HIS
TERMS."
AS YOU KNOW, WOLF, THAT IS NOT A
YES BUT IT'S ALSO NOT A KNOW.
>> Stephen: IT'S A YES AND A NO!
(LAUGHTER)
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CHRISTIE HAS
REACHED THE THEORETICAL QUANTUM
STATE FIRST POSTULATED BY
HEISENBERG IN 1927.
CHRISTIE HAS BECOME SLOWEDING
GER'S CANDIDATE.
LIKE THE THEORETICAL CAT IN A
BOX THAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY ALIVE
AND DEAD UNTIL THE BOX IS OPEN.
SLOWEDINGER.
AS LONG AS, FOLKS, WE DON'T KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT HE'S RUNNING,
CHRISTIE IS A LOCK TO WIN THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
I JUST HOPE, I JUST PRAY THIS
AFTERNOON HE DID NOT OPEN THAT
BOX!
>> I SAID NO.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
FOR ME THE ANSWER WAS NEVER
ANYTHING BUT NO.
>> Stephen: SO WE'VE GOT A DEAD
CAT.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THEN AGAIN, A DEAD CAT MIGHT
ST
