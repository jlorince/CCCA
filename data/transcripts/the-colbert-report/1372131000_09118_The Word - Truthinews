>> Stephen: GOD DAMN IT.
SO THIS SCANDAL IS NOT CONNECTED
TO OBAMA.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
I WANT TO HEAR TONIGHT'S WORD.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TRUTHINEWS.
NATION, LISTEN.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I DO
NOT WATCH THE NEWS TO SEE WHAT I
DON'T WANT TO HEAR.
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.
THESE DAYS THERE'S A NEWS
CHANNEL FOR EVERYONE:
CONSERVATIVES HAVE FOX.
LIBERALS HAVE MSNBC, AND THE
ELDERLY WHO LOST THE REMOTE IN
1988 HAVE HEADLINE NEWS.
NOW, CABLE NETWORKS HAVE ONE
CARDINAL RULE.
THAT RULE IS TO TELL THEIR
VIEWERS WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, TUNE IN
TOMORROW FOR MY SPECIAL REPORT
"HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?"
AND, FOLKS, TELEVISION NEWS
ISN'T ONLY SAYING WHAT YOU WANT
TO HEAR.
THEY'RE LETTING YOU HEAR YOU SAY
IT.
>> WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.
'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
VIA TWITTER.
>> WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK.
>> DON'T FOR GFER GET TO VOTE.
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO HELP US
CREATE A FOOD LOVERS MAP OF THE
WORLD.
>> WE DID A BILL O'REILLY
DOT-COM POLL BUT IT DOES
INDICATE WHAT MY VIEWERS
BELIEVE.
75% OF THEM SAID FACTOR WAS FAIR
IN ITS COVERAGE.
>> TWITTER ONLINE AND THEN WE'LL
FIGURE IT OUT TOMORROW
>> Stephen: JUST LIKE ANCHORMAN
WALTER CRONKITE USED TO SAY: AND
THAT'S THE WAY I THINK IT WAS.
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT TOMORROW.
THE POINT IS CABLE NEWS IS
INCREASINGLY PUTTING THE "ME" IN
MEDIA.
ESPECIALLY THE GOOD FOLKS OVER
AT CNN.
ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE FULL
I.R.S. DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPT
CLEARING OBAMA WAS RELEASED,
CNN'S HEADLINE READ "SHIFTING
I.R.S. POLLS CONTRADICT KEY
DEPOSITION."
TAKE THAT.
KEY DEPOSITION.
CNN HAS THE POLL.
A POLL THAT SAYS HALF OF
AMERICANS THINK OBAMA DID IT
ANYWAY.
NOW, FOLKS, YEARS AGO I GAVE YOU
SOMETHING CALLED TRUTHINESS,
IGNORING WHAT THE FACTS SAY AND
INSTEAD GOING WITH WHAT FEELS
RIGHT IN YOUR GUT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?
FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU PUT A BUNCH OF THOSE
GUTS TOGETHER?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS.
WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU TURN
TRUTHINESS INTO TRUTHINEWS.
WITH TRUTHINEWS, CABLE NEWS
NETWORKS HAVE ONLY ONE
OBLIGATION.
THEIR OBLIGATION IS TO REPORT
WHATEVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ALREADY THINK.
IF ONLY TRUTHINEWS WERE AROUND
IN THE LAST CENTURY WE COULD
HAVE SEEN GREAT HEADLINES LIKE
DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN?
YOU TELL US.
AND 63% BELIEVE TITANIC IS STILL
UNSINKABLE.
LUCKILY, NOW TRUTHINEWS IS HERE
TO USHER IN A NEW STANDARD OF
BROADCASTING.
FIRST, WE ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK
THE NEWS IS.
THEN REPORT THAT NEWS YOU TOLD
US BACK TO YOU.
THEN TAKE AN INSTANT TWITTER
POLL TO SEE IF YOU FEEL INFORMED
BY YOURSELF WHICH WE WILL READ
ON THE AIR UNTIL WE REACH THAT
GOLDEN DAY WHEN WE ARE SO
RESPONSIVE TO OUR VIEWERS THAT
CABLE NEWS IS NOTHING BUT A
MIRROR, A LOGO AND A NEWS CRAWL.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
