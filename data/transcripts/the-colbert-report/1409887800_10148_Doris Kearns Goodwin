THEY'RE COMING FROM A TIME WHERETHERE WERE VERY, VERY RICH
PEOPLE WHO CONTROLLED POLITICS,AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T
HAVE A LOT OF POWER AND WHOSEWORKER RIGHTS WERE BEING TAKEN
AWAY.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO US?

NO, THINK ABOUT IT.
THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN THE RICHAND POOR, PEOPLE WORKING 12
HOURS A DAY, UNSANITARYMEAT-PACKING PLANTS AND MY GUY
TEDDY TAKES IT ON.
HE REALIZES THE RICH WON'T STAYRICH.
THERE WILL BE SOCIALISTS ANDANARCHISTS.
>> STEPHEN: BUT HE WAS  ARICH GUY
HE WAS A RICH GUY.
>> STEPHEN: WHY WOULD HE TURNON HIS OWN CLASS LIKE THAT?
>> BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD IF HEDIDN'T DO SOMETHING TO SOFTEN
THE IMPACT OF THE INDUSTRIALORDER, THE WHOLE THING WOULD
FALL APART.

FORKS.
>> HE WAS FRIGHTENED OF THE RICHPEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD
BE SO BLOATED THAT MONOPOLIESWERE GOING TO SWALLOW EVERYTHING
AND THERE WOULD BE NO SMALLBUSINESSES, PEOPLE ARE IN SLUMS,
HE KNEW FOR THE SAKE OF THECOUNTRY THE ROCK OF
CLASS HATRED WOULD BE THE WORSTTHING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE
COUNTRY.

DID SOMETHING UNETHICAL, THEYSHOULD HAVE A FINE, BE PUT
IN JAIL. POOR PEOPLE, IF THEYDIDN'T WORK, THAT'S A PROBLEM,
BUT GIVE THEM A CHANCE, GIVETHEM AN EDUCATION.
HE AND HE WERE BEST FRIENDS

ONLY. RINOS, RIGHT?
