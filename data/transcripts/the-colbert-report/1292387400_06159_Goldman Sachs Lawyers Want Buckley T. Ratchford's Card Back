( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" )
WOW.
WOW.
NOT ONLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
NOT ONLY WAS THAT DYNAMIC, IN
UNISON, BUT ON PITCH.
I WOULD SAY AN IVY LEAGUE A
CAPPELLA GROUP COULD NOT HAVE
DONE BETTER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NATION, LAST NIGHT I MENTIONED
THAT ONE OF MY WRITERS FOUND
THIS CREDIT CARD BELONGING TO A
PARTNER AT GOLDMAN SACHS.
HIS NAME IS BUCKLEY T.
RATCHFORD.
( LAUGHTER )
ALTHOUGH I ASSUME FOR SHORT
PEOPLE CALL HIM BUCKLEY T.
RATCHFORD.
( LAUGHTER )
AND TO ENCOURAGE MR. T.
RATCHFORD TO APPEAR ON MY SHOW
TO DEFEND WALL STREET BONUSES, I
WENT AND DID A SILLY THING.
I SAID THAT I WOULD REVEAL HIS
CREDIT CARD NUMBER ONE DIGIT A
NIGHT UNTIL HE CAME ON MY SHOW.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, AND I DID
NOT KNOW THIS, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS
LAWYERS.
( LAUGHTER )
WHO EVIDENTLY WATCH MY SHOW
BECAUSE I RECEIVED THIS ACTUAL
E-MAIL FROM THEIR OFFICE OF
GLOBAL SECURITY, WHICH I BELIEVE
IS A EUPHEMISM FOR
"ASSASSINATION SQUAD."
HOW ABOUT "GOLDMAN SACHS
REQUESTS THAT YOU RETURN
MR. RATCHFORD'S CREDIT CARD
TODAY."
( LAUGHTER )
28 MINUTES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I KNOW
WHEN I'VE BEEN BEAT, SO MR. T.
RATCHFORD, I AM SENDING YOUR
CARD BACK TO YOU FORTHWITH
BECAUSE I...
( LAUGHTER )
...I DON'T REALLY NEED IT
ANYMORE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE YOU GO.
COULD YOU SEND THAT BACK.
THANKS SO MUCH.
