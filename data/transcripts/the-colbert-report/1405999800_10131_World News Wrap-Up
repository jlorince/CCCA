OVER THE WEEKEND.
EVIDENTLY NOT.
NATION THIS IS ANUNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY.
AND I HOPE TONIGHT TO COVERIT WITH THE SAME TASTEFUL
RESTRAINT SHOWN BY FOXNEWS'S ANIMATED SMOKING
WRECKAGE GRAPHIC.
IT TOOK REAL SELF CONTROLNOT TO USE THE FOX NFL
SUNDAY ROBOT. I CAN ONLYASSUME THAT MEANS HE'S ON
ASSIGNMENT COVERING GAZA.
NOW FOLKS, IT'S CLEAR THEPLANE WAS TAKEN DOWN BY A
RUSSIAN SA-11 MISSILE ANDTHERE ARE MANY THEORIES
ABOUT WHERE THESERUSSIAN-MADE MISSILES CAME
FROM.
ONE THEORY IS THEY CAME FROMRUSSIA.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
OKAY.

UKRAINE LEAD BY FORMERRUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILESDESPITE THE FACT STROKEY

MOTLEY BAND OF FIGHTERS WHOARE A DRUNKIN PATCHWORK
GROUP THAT IS BEYOND THEMORAL BOUNDARIES.
IN OTHER WORDS, VLADIMIRPUTIN ESSENTIALLY ARMED THE
JUGALOS.
AND IF THIS STORY WERE NOTTRAGIC ENOUGH, AMONG THE
