(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HEY.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE GOP RACE WHILE I WAS GONE.
RICK IS SANTORUM WON THE PRIMARY IN LOUISIANA.
MITT ROMNEY WON THE PRIMARY IN ILLINOIS BUT ROMNEY DID NOT GET TO ENJOY IT FOR LONG.
BECAUSE OF CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS MADE BY ROMNEY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR ERIC FEHRN, STORM.
>> IF THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT AT THE THIS MATE FORCE THE GOVERNOR TO ATTACK TO
THE RIGHT IT WOULD HURT HIM WITH MOD RATE VOTERS.
>> I THINK HE HIT A RESET BUTTON FOR THE FALL CAMPAIGN.
EVERYTHING CHANGES.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN ETCH-A-SKETCH, YOU CAN KIND OF SHAKE IT UP AND WE START ALL OVER AGAIN.
>> Stephen: YES, ROMNEY IS LIKE AN ETCH-A-SKETCH IN THAT THEY ARE BOTH SQUARE AND COLORLESS.
(LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, NOW PEOPLE THINK THAT WAS A METAPHOR FOR ROMNEY BEING INCONSISTENT.
BUT THE ETCH-A-SKETCH IS VERY CONSISTENT.
YOU CAN SHAKE IT ALL YOU WANT AND ALL YOU'RE EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRAW IS STAIRS.
THAT WAS MY ATTEMPT AT A BIRD.
BUT SOMEHOW ERIC FEHRNSTROM'S COMMENTS IGNITED A MEDIA STORM.
>> THE ETCH-A-SKETCH PRESIDENT.
>> THE ETCH-A-SKETCH COMMENT THIS WEEK WAS DEVASTATING TO HIM IT PLAYED DIRECTLY TO
THIS NARRATIVE THAT HE IS A MAN WHO DOESN'T HAVE CORE BELIEFS.
>> THAT ETCH A STEP-- ETCH-A-SKETCH ADMISSION HIGHLIGHTS HIS ACHILLES HEEL.
>> THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED AS ETCH-A-SKETCH DAY IN CAMPAIGN 2012.
>> SO HERE'S GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S STAFF, I MEAN THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY
TO WAIT TILL THEY GET THE NOMINATION TO EXPLAIN TO US HOW THEY WILL SELL US OUT.
>> MY PUBLIC POLICY ISN'T WRITTEN ON AN ETCH-A-SKETCH,
IT'S WRITTEN ON MY HEART.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, THE ONLY WAY TO READ WHAT'S WRITTEN ON RICK SANTORUM'S
HEART IS WITH A TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY.
BUT FOLKS, I DON'T SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING COMPARED TO A CLASSIC TOY.
THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS FULL OF THEM.
WE'VE GOT MR. POTATO HEAD.
THE MAGICAL TREASURE TROLL,
AND THE KEN DOLL.
TOTALLY SMOOTH DOWN THERE.
AND YES, ERIC, SOMETHING,
ETCH-A-SKETCH COMMENT MAY REINFORCE THE NARRATIVE CREATED BY ROMNEY'S ENEMIES
THAT HE IS WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING TO GET ELECTED BUT THAT IS SO CYNICAL.
REAL POLITICAL PLAYERS KNOW WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT.
>> AND THE GUY SAID WELL,
YOU KNOW, THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS AND THEN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION YOU GO BACK TO THE MIDDLE WHICH
EVERYBODY KNOWS IS TRUE.
>> EXACTLY WHY ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO TURN THESE COMMENTS INTO SOMETHING KRAVEN.
HE IS JUST SAYING THAT A CANDIDATE WILL SAY ANYTHING TO GET THE NOMINATION THEN
SAY ANYTHING TO GET ELECTED,
THEN SAY ANYTHING TO GET A SECOND TERM.
THEN STAND ON PRINCIPLES FOR SIX MONTHS UNTIL HE'S A LAME DUCK.
YOU KNOW, COURAGE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS IS PROOF THAT ROMNEY IS THE RIGHT MAN BECAUSE MITT
PROMISED WILL BOOST BUSINESS AND BRING BACK THE ECONOMY AND THIS ETCH-A-SKETCH KERR
ENOUGH SELL ALREADY DOING IT.
>> THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN ETCH-A-SKETCH GAFFE HAS BEEN A BOON TO THE COMPANY THAT
MAKES THE CLASSIC TOY.
SALES OF ETCH-A-SKETCH TOYS ARE BOOMING.
>> AMAZON SALES OF THE TOY ARE REPORTEDLY UP 3,000 PERCENT.
>> Stephen: YES, THE ECONOMY NEED ITS MORE OF THIS.
I SAY WE MUST GET OUT THERE AND COMPARE ROMNEY TO MORE PRODUCTS THAT REINFORCE HIS
SUPPOSED WEAKNESSES.
HERE WE GO.
MITT ROMNEY IS LIKE SILLY PUTTY ON A NEWSPAPER.
YOU PRESS HIM ON TO YOUR POLITICAL BELIEFS AND HE BECOMES AN EXACT COPY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLUS, OKAY, M ITT IS LIKE LINCOLN LOGS.
BOTH STIFF AND WOODEN.
AND MITT ROMNEY IS LIKE A LEGO MAN, HE'S ONLY GOT ONE FACIAL EXPRESSION AND HIS HAIR SNAPS ON.
