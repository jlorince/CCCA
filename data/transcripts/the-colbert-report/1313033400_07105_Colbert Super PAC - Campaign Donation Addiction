>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, LAST MONTH I FORMED
COLBERT SUPER-PAC AND SINCE THEN
I HAVE LEARNED SOME DISTURBING
STUFF ABOUT CAMPAIGN FINANCE.
APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE ARE SUCH
POLITICAL JUNKIES THAT DONATING
MONEY IS A WAY TO GET A FIX.
IN THE LAST QUARTER ALONE
"MORE THAN 1,300 PEOPLE GAVE
FIVE OR MORE TIMES" TO THE SAME
CANDIDATE.
FOR EXAMPLE, "I'M TRYING TO
RESTRAIN MYSELF," SAID ONE DONOR
WHO IN RECENT MONTHS HAS GIVEN
TO TIM PAWLENTY 11 TIMES.
MAKING TIM PAWLENTY THE WORLD'S
MOST BORING ADDICTION, NEXT TO
FREEBASING ICEBERG LETTUCE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOT JUST REPUBLICANS ARE
ADDICTED.
DONATING TO OBAMA IS LIKE
SMOKING POT:
EVERYTHING FEELS NEW FOR A
WHILE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
YOU REALIZE YOU DIDN'T GET
ANYTHING DONE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, THESE CAMPAIGNS
-- YOU GUYS BEEN HITTING THE
OBAMA?
THESE CAMPAIGNS SOLICITING MONEY
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT BUTTONS TO
PUSH.
THEY SEND URGENT EMAILS WITH
EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER
LIKE BACHMANN'S "JOIN THE
FIGHT," PAWLENTY'S "I CAN'T DO
IT ALONE," AND HERMAN CAIN'S
"GIVE ME FIVE DOLLARS AND I'LL
PUNCH A MUSLIM."
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS SHAMELESS MANIPULATION,
AND I AM DISGUSTED THAT I'M NOT
DOING IT.
SO I NEED TO DRAFT A QUICK EMAIL
TO MY SUPER-PAC MEMBERS.
SUBJECT LINE: "SPIDERS IN YOUR
HAIR!"
[LAUGHTER]
DEAR FUTURE VICTIMS, THEY'RE
DOING IT AGAIN, AND WE HAVE ONLY
SECONDS TO STOP THEM BEFORE YOU,
YOUR PETS, AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE
COULD EXPERIENCE WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE MOST AFRAID OF.
AND DON'T FORGET, EARLIER I USED
THE PHRASE "SPIDERS IN YOUR
HAIR."
[LAUGHTER]
SEND ME $25 RIGHT NOW TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE, OR SEND ME $100 TO
MAKE FOUR DIFFERENCES.
[LAUGHTER]
OR JUST LET THE BAD GUYS WIN.
YOUR CHOICE.
QUICK, LOOK BEHIND YOU!
STEPHEN COLBERT.
AND SEND.
[ APPLAUSE ]
SO FOLKS, GIVE COMPULSIVELY.
WE ACCEPT CASH, CREDIT CARDS,
HEIRLOOM JEWELRY, GOLD TEETH,
SILVER TEETH, AND TEETH.
[LAUGHTER]
