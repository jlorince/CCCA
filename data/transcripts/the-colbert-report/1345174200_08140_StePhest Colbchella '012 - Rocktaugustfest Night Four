WELCOME ONE AND ALL.
WELCOME, WELCOME MY FRIENDS TO STEVEFEST COLCHELLA 012.
THE FESTIVAL OF LIFE.
NOW ROCK NATION, IT'S OUR FINAL EVENING HERE ABOARD THE INTREPID, I KNOW O I
KNOW, WHAT A-- WHAT A LONG,
STRANGE TRIP IT'S BEEN.
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE WEEK OF BANDS, FUN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT THERE IS ONE MUSICIAN WHO HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM YET.
YOU KNOW THAT MOTTO, LIVE FOR NOW, WHICH OF COURSE TAKES ON A DARKER MEANING IF YOU INSERT A COMMA.
LIVE, FOR NOW.
BECAUSE OF COURSE SOME DAY WE WILL ALL DIE.
AND ALL OUR EFFORTS WILL BE AS TEMPORARY AS WORDS WRIT ON WATER.
LIFE IS BUT A WALKING SHADOW.
A POOR PLAYER WHO STRUTS AND FRETS AN HOUR UPON THE STAGE AND IS HEARD FROM NO MORE.
IT IS A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT FULL OF SOUND AND FURY.
SIGNIFYING PEPSI.
NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET'S SEND IT BACK UP TO MY COLLEAGUE THERE ON THE BRIDGE.
INTREPP PID, PLEASE WELCOME MY GOOD FRIEND MR. STEPHEN COLBERT.
TAKE IT AWAY, STEPHEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
