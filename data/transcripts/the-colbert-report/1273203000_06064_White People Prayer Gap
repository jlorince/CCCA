ANYWAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
HAPPY NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER,
EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS IS THE ONE DAY THAT SEPARATES US FROM THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.
BUT WE BETTER PRAY IT UP GOOD,
FOLKS, BECAUSE THIS YEAR MAY BE OUR LAST.
CONSIDER THIS: FRANKLIN GRAHAM,
SON OF BILLY, WAS DISINVITED FROM THE PENTAGON'S PRAYER DAY EVENT JUST BECAUSE HE SAID ISLAM
WAS AN EVIL RELIGION THAT PRACTICES MURDER, WHICH I DID NOT SAY, BY THE WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE MUSLIMS ARE SUPER.
IN FACT, I THINK THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD AND I WOULD BE BEST BUDS.
BUT MOST DISTURBING WAS THIS INFO GRAPHIC I SAW ON THE "USA TODAY" TODAY.
ALL RIGHT, PRAYING BEFORE BED,
IT SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS WHO PRAY BEFORE GOING TO BED.
71% OF BLACKS, 45% OF HISPANICS BUT ONLY 32% OF WHITES.
WHITE PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUTPRAYED.
[LAUGHTER]
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU THE "USA TODAY" FOR THIS VITAL INFORMATION.
I WAS RUNNING OUT OF REASONS TO FEEL THREATENED BY MINORITIES.
FOLKS, WE CANNOT ALLOW A PRAYER GAP.
IF THIS CONTINUES, BLACK JESUS AND HISPANIC JESUS COULD GANG UP ON WHITE JESUS.
