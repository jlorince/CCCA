>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST OF "THE
NEW YORK TIMES," WHICH ALSO
QUALIFIES HIM TO BE THE LIBERAL
COLUMNIST FOR "THE NEW YORK
POST."
PLEASE WELCOME ROSS DOUTHAT.
HEY, MR. DOUTHAT, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: IT'S AN HONOR FOR
ME TO BE HERE, TOO.
NOW, I GOT TO SAY, YOU AND
BROOKS, RIGHT, WHAT YOU CALL A
CONSERVATIVE OVER AT "THE NEW
YORK TIMES."
YOU AND DAVID BROOKS, RIGHT?
>> YOU KNOW, I GET THAT A LOT,
STEPHEN.
I THINK WE SHOULD GET EXTRA
CREDIT FOR BEING THE
CONSERVATIVES AT "THE NEW YORK
TIMES."
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE LIKE A GUY WITH A PEANUT
ALLERGY WALKING INTO THE PEANUT
FACTORY.
I'D KEEP AN EPIPEN HANDY, BUT
WHEN I READ YOU, YOU DON'T READ
THAT CONSERVATIVE TO ME.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THAT SHRILL.
YOU SEEM LIKE I'M JUST READING
LIKE SOMETHING ONE OF MY
BROTHERS WRITE
WRIGHT-PHILLIPS -- MIGHT RIGHT.
>> I'M WRITING FOR LIBERALS.
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TALK TO
LIBERALS, YOU HAVE TO SOUND ALL
REASONABLE, YOU KNOW?
IT'S TOUGH.
>> Stephen: OH, YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET THE JON STEWART CROWD TO
LISTEN TO CONSERVATIVES.
>> I'M TRYING TO SEDUCE THE JON
STEWARTS OF THE WORLD WITH MY
REASONABILITY.
>> Stephen: HENCE THE BEARD.
>> HENCE THE BEARD.
>> Stephen: IT'S VERY
SEDUCTIVE.
NOW, DO YOU THINK THE
REPUBLICANS... PEOPLE ARE
CRITICIZING THIS PLEDGE THAT
THEY MADE, SOME OF THE PEOPLE,
YOUR ERIC ERICSSONS OF THE
WORLD, A TRUE REPUBLICAN, A TRUE
CONSERVATIVE, ARE SAYING THAT
IT'S A NOTHING BURGER, THAT
THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS BEING
OFFERED.
IT'S MORE OF THE SAME.
WHY SHOULD THE REPUBLICANS GIVE
THEIR SOLUTIONS NOW BECAUSE THEN
THE DEMOCRATS' COULD STEAL THEM.
>> THAT'S A VALID WORRY.
I THINK THE DANGER IS IF YOU
DON'T GIVE SOLUTIONS, YOU WIN AN
ELECTS,AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE
GOING TO, TO YOUR DELIGHT, MY
DELIGHT AND SO ON, BUT THEN YOU
GO TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
YOU SAY, WELL, NOW WE'RE GOING
TO DO X, Y AND Z, AND THEY SAY,
WELL, YOU DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT
THIS.
>> Stephen: WE KNOW THE
SOLUTIONS.
SPOILER ALERT: TAX CUTS.
RIGHT?
>> NOW I'M GOING TO SIDE LIKE
ONE OF THOSE SQUISHY
CONSERVATIVES THAT YOU'RE DOWN
ON, BUT THE SOLUTIONS ARE TAX
CUTS AND SPENDING CUTS, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: THE TEA PARTY
WANTS SPENDING CUTS.
WHAT DO WE CUT FIRST, SOCIAL
SECURITY OR MEDICAID OR BOTH?
>> I THINK YOU JUST KILLED...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK YOU START WITH THE MONEY
THAT GETS SPENT ON PEOPLE WHO
DON'T NEED IT, SO YOU START
WITH, YOU KNOW, YOU SAY TO
PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING
MEDICARE... SEEP STEEP GUYS LIKE
ME?
>> SORT OF AN UNCOMFORTABLE
MOMENT, BUT ACTUALLY, NO,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT... YOU'RE NOT
ON MEDICARE.
>> Stephen:LY BE SOME DAY.
>> WHEN YOU'RE ON MEDICARE, I
THINK YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY WE
HAVE TO START WITH.
>> Stephen: BUT I'VE BEEN
PAYING IN.
WHY SHOULDN'T I GET MY MONEY
OUT?
>> WELL, YOU'VE SORT OF BEEN
PAYING IN, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH
MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY, IS
THE THEORY IS YOU PAY IN AND
THEN YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PAY
NEW YORK BUT THE REALITY IS THAT
THE YOUNGER GENERATION PAYS FOR
THE OLDER GENERATION, AND
IT'S... CONSERVATIVES LIKE TO
SAY IT'S A PONZI SCHEME, WHICH
IS KIND OF AN EXAGGERATION, BUT
IT'S NOT PAY AND YOU GET.
THAT'S WHY BOTH PROGRAMS ARE
MORE MEDICARE THAN SOCIAL
SECURITY, BUT WHY THEY'RE BOTH
GOING INTO THE RED.
>> Stephen: THE REPUBLICANS
NOW ARE EMBRACING THE TEA PARTY.
AND LET'S BE CLEAR, THE TEA
PARTY, NOT REPUBLICANS, IT'S THE
TEA PARTY.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WHAT THE REPUBLICAN WANTS AND
THE TEA PARTY?
IS THE TEA PARTY SOCIAL
CONSERVATISM?
, LIKE ANTIABORTION, NO GAY
MARRIAGE?
>> NO, THERE ARE PLENTY OF
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES IN THE TEA
PARTY, BUT THE TEA PARTY IS A
COMBINATION OF, AGAIN, I'M
RUNNING THE RISK OF
CONTRADICTING YOU A LITTLE BIT,
BUT REPUBLICANS AND THEN MORE OF
THE ROSS PEROT VOTERS.
>> Stephen: IT'S A HUGE TENT
BECAUSE YOU GOT CARL PALADINO
WHO SENDS OUT BEASTALTY E-MAILS
AND YOU GOT CHRISTINE O'DONNELL
WHO IS ANTI-MASTURBATION.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: TO INCLUDE BOTH
THOSE PEOPLE.
>> THIS IS WHAT MAJORITIES ARE
MADE OF.
PLUS APPLAUSE
>> Stephen: BY THE WAY, HOW DO
YOU COME DOWN ON CHRISTINE
O'DONNELL'S ANTI-MASTURBATION
STANCE?
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT MAKES
FOR GOOD PUBLIC POLICY, BUT...
>> Stephen: YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO INTRODUCE THAT BILL?
>> I WOULDN'T WANT TO INTRODUCE
THAT BILL, BUT IN FAIRNESS TO
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL, SHE WASN'T
RUNNING FOR THE SENATE.
SHE WAS ON A MTV SHOW.
IF YOU GO BACK AND WATCH THE
TAPE...
>>
>> Stephen: I'VE WATCHED IT
REPEATEDLY.
>> SHE'S A CHRISTIAN, AND WHAT'S
MORE LUSTFUL THAN GRATIFYING
YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: I AGREE.
WHERE IS THE FUNDING FOR THAT?
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, STEPHEN.
