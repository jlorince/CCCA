WHOLE TIME.
NOW, NATION, THERE IS NO ONE WE
AMERICANS REVERE MORE THAN OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS, WHO CREATED
THE GREATEST, FREEST, HUMBLEST
NATION IN HISTORY.
THAT'S WHY WE PUT THEM ON OUR
MONUMENTES, OUR MOUNT RUSHMORES,
AND OUR CAMEL CASH.
LET US NEVER FORGET GENERAL
JOSEPH CAMEL LEADING HIS TROOPS
INTO FLAVOR COUNTRY.
THE LIBERALS WERE ALWAYS TRYING
TO SULLY THE THINGS OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS DID BY TALKING ABOUT THE
THINGS OUR FOUNDING FARTHERS
DID.
TAKE CHRIS MATTHEWS.
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS THOMAS
JEFFERSON HAD A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SALLY HEMINGS AND HAD KIDS.
JAMES MADISON WHO DRAFTLET THE
CONSTITUTION HAD OVER 100
SLAVES, HAD THEM ALL HIS LIFE.
DIDN'T EVEN FREE THEM IN HIS
WILL.
>> Stephen:  OF COURSE HE
DIDN'T FREE THEM IN HIS WILL.
IMAGINE THE SHOCK TO HIS
CHILDREN-- FIRST THEY LOSE THEIR
FARTHER, THEN THEY LOSE THEIR
SLAVES.
PLUS WHO IS GOING TO DIG THE
GRAVE AND PASS THE BISCUITS AT
THE FUNERAL.
AND WHY, WHY, FOLKS NEEDLESSLY
TARNISHING HIS REPUTATION FOR
BANGING FRENCH WHO ARES.
I PREFER TO THINK OF HIM BANGING
AMERICAN WHORS.
O.
( CHEERING )
BRAVO.
WORST OF ALL, FOLKS, THERE'S THE
NEW EXHIBITION, SLAVERY AT
JEFFERSON'S MONT SHELL OH,
PARADOX OF LIBERTY, WHICH TURNS
JEFFERSON'S HISTORIC HOME INTO A
REMINDER THAT OVER THE COURSE OF
HIS LIFE, JEFFERSON OWNED 600
PEOPLE.
BUT THAT IS CONVENIENTLY
IGNORING THE FACT THAT THANKS TO
JEFFERSON, THOSE SLAVES WERE
LIVING IN A FREE COUNTRY.
FORTUNATELY, SOME MODERN PARIS
ARE DEFENDING OUR FOUNDERS, AND
THEY BRING US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AMERICAN HISTORY X.'d.
FOR A YEAR, ONE GROUP HAS WAGED
A COUNTER-OFFENSIVE AGAINST
THESE FOUNDING FATHER FACT
ATTACKS.
>> SOME MEMBERS OF THE TEA PARTY
SAY WHAT'S IN YOUR CHILD'S
TEXTBOOKS MAY BE GIVING THEM A
NEGATIVE OPINION ABOUT OUR
NATION'S HISTORY.
>> THE TEA PARTY IS TELLING
STATE POLITICIANS WE NEED TO
TONE DOWN TALK OF SLAVERY AND
STOP MAKING IT ABOUT RACE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  YES, PLEASE, STOP
MAKING SLAVERY ABOUT RACE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT WAS ABOUT
ECONOMICS.
BLACK PEOPLE JUST HAPPENED TO BE
A GREAT INVESTMENT.
NOW, A SPOKESMAN--
( LAUGHTER )
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE TENNESSEE
TEA PARTY SAYS THEY JUST WANT TO
ADDRESS "MADE-UP CRITICISM ABOUT
THE FOUNDERS INTRUDING ON THE
INDIANS OR HAVING SLAVES OR
BEING HYPOCRITES."
YES, THAT IS TOTALLY MADE-UP
CRITICISM.
THE FOUNDERS DIDN'T INTRUDE ON
THE INDIANS.
THEY KNOCKFIRST, THEN KILLED
THEM.
THE POINT IS, NO ONE-- NO ONE'S
TALKING ABOUT REWRITING HISTORY.
JUST CUTTING OUT CHUNKS OF IT.
OF COURSE, THAT WILL LEAF A FEW
HOLES IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS, SO
WE ADULTS NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER
TO GET OUR STORIES STRAIGHT.
NOW,, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT TO DO
THIS JUST IN CASE THE KIDS START
ASKING UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS
LIKE, "WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?"
AND "WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
ARAPAHOE?"
SO IF THE KIDS-- IF THE KIDS
ASK, GEORGE WASHINGTON DIDN'T
OWN SLAVES.
REMEMBER?
HE AND MARTHA GENEROUSLY ADOPTED
HUNDREDS OF AFRICAN CHILDREN TO
CULTIVATE THEIR TOBACCO.
THEY WERE LIKE THE 18th
CENTURY BRANGELINA.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE )
AND ANDREW JACKSON--
( APPLAUSE )
OLD HICKORY DIDN'T FORCE THE
CIVILIZED TRIBES ON A FIVE-STATE
DEATH MARCH.
THEY WERE HIKING THE APPALACHIAN
TRAIL AND GOT LOST.
I MEAN, WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR
THEM.
IN THE 19, WE'RE KEEPING UHEIR
CONTINENT WARM.
OF COURSE, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO
WANT TO CUT OUT THIS PART OF OUR
HISTORY WHERE WE'RE LYING TO OUR
KIDS ABOUT THOSE PARTS OF OUR
HISTORY.
BUT I THINK IN THE END, THEY'LL
THANK US FOR NOT TEACHING THEM
THE BAD PARTS BECAUSE THOSE WHO
DON'T LEARN THEIR HISTORY ARE
DOOMED TO REPEAT IT.
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL MAKE THE
HISTORY THEY'RE DOOMED TO REPEAT
A NICE ONE.
