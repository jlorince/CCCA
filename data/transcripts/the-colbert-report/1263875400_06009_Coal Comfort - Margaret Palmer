NATION, IF A DIAMOND IS A GIRL'S
BEST FRIEND, THEN COAL IS ITS
HOTTER YOUNGER SISTER.
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF COAL
MINING, IT WAS DIRTY, DANGEROUS
WORK, AS SEEN IN THIS SAD
FOOTAGE.
♪♪
WE LOST A LOT OF GOOD MEN TO
INFLATABLE DRAGONS.
THANKFULLY MODERN SCIENCE HAS
FOUND A MUCH SAFER WAY TO GET
OUR COAL.
BLOWING THE TOPS OFF MOUNTAINS.
AWESOME!
OH, DADDY.
IT'S GREAT.
YOU START WITH SOME BORING
TREE-COVERED MOUNTAIN, AND YOU
TURN IT INTO AN EXCITING
LIFELESS MOON BASE.
PLUS IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT
WAY TO GET TO THE COAL INSIDE.
THAT'S WHY WHEN I GO TO THE
DENTIST, I HAVE HIM REMOVE MY
TEETH THROUGH THE TOP OF MY
HEAD.
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY NOT EVERYONE
OUT THERE GETS IT, LIKE THE
E.P.A.
IN SEPTEMBER THEY PUT 79
MOUNTAIN REMOVAL PROJECTS ON
HOLD.
WHO MADE THE E.P.A. THE
PROTECTOR OF THE ENVIRONMENT?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, GOOD NEWS, NATION, THIS
MONTH THE E.P.A. REVERSED THEIR
POSITION AND AWARDED A PERMIT
FOR A 600-ACRE MINE IN WEST
VIRGINIA TO THE PATRIOT COAL
CORPORATION.
YOU KNOW IT'S PATRIOTIC COAL
BECAUSE THEY'RE USING THEIR
BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR TO TURN
THOSE PURPLE MOUNTAIN MAJESTIES
INTO AMBER WAVES OF GRAY.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THIS DECISION DOESN'T
PLEASE EVERYBODY OUT THERE.
LIKE THE SCIENTISTS WHO JUST
PUBLISHED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE
STUDY EVER ONNP
NHURSC"
THEY CLAIM T WASTE MATERIAL
GETS DUMPED INTO THE SURROUNDING
VALLEYS AND STREAMS,
OBLITERATING THE ECOSYSTEM AND
THAT THE SIGNS ARE SO
OVERWHELMING THAT THE ONLY
CONCLUSION THAT ONE CAN REACH IS
THAT MOUNTAINTOP MINING NEEDS TO
BE STOPPED.
EXCUSE ME.
BUT I SAY MOUNTAINTOP MINING IS
A PROUD AMERICAN TRADITION.
DID YOU KNOW THAT ON MT.
RUSHMORE LINCOLN USED TO HAVE A
STOVE PIPE HAT?
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THEY LOPPED IT OFF TO GET TO
HIS SWEET BRAIN COAL.
[LAUGHTER]
TRUE STORY.
IT'S A TRUE STORY.
BESIDES, HOW ELSE IS AMERICA
SUPPOSED TO GET OUR COAL?
WE CURRENTLY GET 10% OF IT FROM
MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL, AND EXPERTS
SAY ENFORCING THE RULES TO
MINIMIZE DUMPING ALL THIS WASTE
INTO THE STREAMS COULD ADD $1 OR
$2 PER TON TO THE COST OF COAL.
ONE OR TWO DOLLARS?
FOLKS, MY SHOW BURNS THREE TONS
OF COAL PER NIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I OFFERING SHOVEL
INTERNSHIPS.
FASTER, JAY.
YOU WANT THAT COLLEGE CREDIT OR
NOT?
BESIDES, MOST OF THE STREAM
POISONING HAPPENS IN APPALACHIA,
AND THE ONLY PEOPLE IT AFFECTS
ARE THE ONE REMAINING GROUP THAT
EVERYBODY STILL FEELS
COMFORTABLE MAKING FUN OF,
HILLBILLIES.
>> OH, NELLIE!
>> Stephen: HILLBILLIES ARE
POOR.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
THOUGH IF WE KEEP TAKING AWAY
THE MOUNTAINS, WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO START CALLING THEM JUST
BILLIES.
IF YOU ASK ME, THE WOMAN WHO LED
THIS STUDY, DR. MARGARET PALMER
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND,
IS MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A
MOLEHILL THAT I'M ABOUT TO BLOW
THE TOP OFF OF.
PLEASE WELCOME DR. MARGARET
PALMER.
DR. PALMER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DOCTOR,E.
YOU'RE ALL ANTI-MOUNTAINTOP
REMOVAL, BUT LET'S FACE FACTS,
THESE MOUNTAINS WILL GROW BACK.
>> ACTUALLY, THESE MOUNTAINS ARE
300 MILLION YEARS OLD, AND EVEN
IF THE MOUNTAINS GROW BACK...
>> Stephen: THEY'LL GROW BACK
IN ANOTHER 300 MILLION YEARS.
>> GUESS WHAT, WHILE THOSE
MOUNTAINS ARE GROWING BACK, WE
HAVE ALL SORTS OF TOXIC
CHEMICALS GOING INTO THE
STREAMS.
>> LIKE WHAT?
LIKE WHAT'S GOING IN THERE?
>> LIKE SELENIUM, LIKE
MANGANESE, THESE THINGS...
>> Stephen: DO YOU KNOW HOW
MUCH YOU PAY FOR MINERAL
SUPPLEMENTS LIKE MANGANESE AND
SELENIUM?
WE'RE GIVING THEM TO THESE
PEOPLE FOR FREE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO YOU SAY THE STREAMS ARE
POISON?
>> LET ME TELL YOU.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DRINKING
WATER FROM THESE STREAMS.
FISH SOMETIMES HAVE TWO EYES ON
ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
>> Stephen: FLOUNDER.
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN TOO MANY
FLOUNDERS IN THE STREAMS OF WEST
VIRGINIA.
>> Stephen: MOUNTAIN FLOUNDER.
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKEBIG BRITTA FILTER
AT THE MOUTH OF THAT STREAM?
HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT?
>> IT IS INTERESTING TO ASK WHY
THE WATER'ST CLEANED UP, BUT
YOU CAN DO THIS IN A WAY THAT
DOESN'T BLOW UP MOUNTAINS.
THERE ARE MORE EFFICIENT, WELL,
NOT NECESSARILY EFFICIENT IN
TERMS OF MAKING MUST BE...
>> Stephen: SO YOU DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BE TAKING OFF THE TOPS
OF MOUNTAINS?
YOU THINK THERE IS A BETTER WAY
IN
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO TAKE
OFFEBOTTOM OF MOUNTAINS?
YOU REALIZE THAT'S DANGEROUS.
>> IN FACT, IF YOU DO IT MORE
TRADITIONAL WAY, MORE MINERS
WILL BE EMPLOYED, WHO ARE
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO THE
UNITED STATES.
COAL IS IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED
STATES RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
IT IS OUR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY,
CLEAN COAL.
WE HAVE A LOT OF COAL.
WE'RE THE SAUDI ARABIA OF COAL.
>> UNTIL WE GET TO A MORE
SUSTAINABLE FORM OF ENERGY, WE
DO NEED COAL IN THIS COUNTRY,
AND THE MINERS PLAY AN IMPORTANT
ROLE.
WHAT WE DON'T NEED IS PEOPLE
THAT ARE HAVING SIGNIFICANT
HEALTH PROBLEMS IN THESE AREAS
AROUND SURFACE MINING.
WE'RE TALKING HIGHER RATES OF
KIDNEY DISEASE, CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE, LUNG CANCER.
IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
MORTALITY RATE IN REGIONSF THE
APPALACHIANS, MORTALITY GOES UP
AS A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT OF
MINING THAT GOES ON IN THE
COUNTIES, AND IT'S NOT MINERS.
IT'S CHILDREN AND WOMEN.
>> Stephen: OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO PLAY THE CHILDREN AND WOMEN
CARD.
FINE.
BUT YOU SAY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
IN THESE AREAS ARE GETTING THESE
DISEASES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THERE'S NO QUESTION.
>> Stephen: BUT IF YOU KEEP
REMOVING THE MOUNTAINS,
EVENTUALLY THESE AREAS WON'T BE
THERE EITHER, AND NO ONE WILL BE
LIVING THERE.
THE PROBLEM KIND OF INVOLVES
ITSELF.
AND LET ME ASK YOU THIS, ALL
RIGHT, IF WE DIDN'T BLOW UP
THESE MOUNTAINS, DON'T YOU THINK
THESE MOUNTAINS WOULD JUST AS
EASILY BLOW US UP?
HAVE YOU HEARD OF VESUVIUS OR
MOUNT ST. HELEN'S?
PAYBACK IS A BITCH.
THIS IS OUR TURN.
DR. PALMER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
DR. MARGARET PALMER,
