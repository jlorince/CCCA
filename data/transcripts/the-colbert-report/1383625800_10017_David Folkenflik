THIS IS ABOUT A GUY WHO ITHINK IS IN MANY WAYS THE
MOST INFLUENTIAL MEDIAFIGURE IN THE ENGLISH SPEAK
WORLD.

GO AHEAD, WE'LL EDIT THATOUT.
HE IS THE GUY WHO HAS BENTPOLITICIANS TO HIS WILL,
SENT PEOPLE SPEAKING TO BEPRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTERS,
EVEN ASPIRING POPES TOTRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES TO

BELIEVE IN RESPONSE TO SOMEOF HIS PHILANTHROPY TOWARDS
THE ARCHDIOCESE OF LOSANGELES.

NEW YORK POST", "THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL," ONE OF THE
BEST NEWSPAPERS IN THERECORD, A LITTLE FAMILIAR.
AND FOX NEWS.
IN THE U.K. HE CONTROLS OVERA THIRD THIRD OF ALL
NATIONAL NEWSPAPERSERKLATION.
IN AUSTRALIA HE CONTROLSBETWEEN 65 AND 70% OF MAJOR
DAILY NEWSPAPER CIRCULATIONSO HE IS A MAJOR FIGURE IN
THE TWO OTHER COUNTRIES ASWELL AS OUR OWN.

MINUTES.
SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.
ELIZABETH HASSLEBECKGROWINGLY PORTRAYS MICHELLE
MALKIN AS SOMEONE WITHABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF HER
OWN MONSTROSITY.
>> SEE, WHAT HUMAN WOULDCOME UP WITH THAT I THINK
RATHER THAN SAYING WHY WOULDYOU WANT TO BE NEGATIVE
ABOUT THIS GUY, I THINK HE'SFASCINATING AND COMPLEX.
WHATTED REALLY LEAD ME TOHIM WAS AFTER COVERING NEWS
OUTLET FORCE MANY YEARS IN2011 A FEW SUMMERS AGO THERE
WAS A HACKING SCANDAL IN THEU.K..
>> Stephen: I HAVEN'T HEARDMUCH ABOUT THAT ON FOX NEWS.
>> NOT SOME OF.
SO IN THE U.K. ON TRIALRIGHT NOW IS THE FORMER
HAND-PICKED C.E.O. OFMURDOCH'S BRITISH NEWSPAPER
DIVISION.
AND ALSO THE FORMER EDITORIN CHIEF OF THE NEWS WORLD
TABLOID WHICH USED TO BE THELARGEST SELLING SUNDAY PAPER
IN GREAT BRITAIN AND WENT ONTO THE CHIEF PR GUY FOR THE
PRIME MINISTER, DAVIDCAMERON.
THEY ARE ON TRIAL FORBREAKING INTO THE VOICE-MAIL
MESSAGES OF PEOPLE IN THEU.K..
>> Stephen: IT'S CALLEDINVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.
>> IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OFINVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU GETTHE INFORMATION ON THIS, DID
YOU HACK INTO HIS PHONE.
>> I DID SOMETHING CALLEDREPORTING.
IT INVOLVED A LOT OFINTERVIEWS, WELL OVER 100
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BUT NOTEVERYTHING YOU COULD HAVE
GOT.
>> IF YOU WOULD HAD HACKMOOD HIS PHONE MAIL WOW HAVE
LEARNED MORE, TRUE OR FALSE.
>> I PROBABLY WOULD HAVELEARNED MORE, TRUE.
>> Stephen: SO THEY AREBETTER JOURNALISTS THAN ARE
YOU.
>> PERHAPS SO I THINKTHAT-- I THINK A LOT OF FEEL
IN GREAT BRITAIN THINKOTHERWISE BECAUSE AMONG THE
PEOPLE THAT WERE HACKED.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE ENGLISHWHO CARES.
>> I KNOW BUT AMONG THEPEOPLE WHO WERE HACKED WERE
NOT ONLY JUST CELEBRITIES,NOT ONLY POLITICIANS, SOWN
AS UNIVERSITILY CORRUPT ANDPHILANDERING BUT PEOPLE WHO
WERE THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES,A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO HAD
BEEN ABDUCTED AND MURDERHEAD HER PHONE HACKED AND IT
TURNED OUT THOUSANDS OFOTHERS WERE TARGETED AS
WELL.
PEOPLE WHO WERE THE VICTIMSOF TERRORIST STRIKES, JULY
2005 IN THE.
CAN.
BRITISH WAR DEAD IN IRAQAND AFGHANISTAN THERE WAS A
YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS ALSOABDUCTED AND KILLED.
GIVEN A PHONE BY REBECCABROOKS THE HEAD OF TABLOID
THERE AND THEN SHE SAID YOUCAN CALL ME ANY TIME, USE
THE CELL PHONE NOR ANYTHINGYOU NEED, THAT PHONE WAS
HACKED BY REBECCA'S OWNREPORTERS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYINGTHAT MURDOCH KNEW ABOUT
THESE THINGS.
>> THAT'S AN IMPORTANTQUESTION.
>> Stephen: IT IS, I JUSTASKED IT.
>> SO THERE IS NO SENSE THATMURDOCH FEW ABOUT THAT,
THERE IS A SENSE THAT HECONTINUALLY PUSHED THE
TABLOID TO FIND OUT GREATERAND GREATER DEGREE OF GOSSIP
AND NEWS.
PUSHED THEM RELENTLESSLY INAN AGE OF HAVING TO COMPETE
AGAINST THE INTERNET SITES.
BUT IT WAS ALSO IN A CULTUREIN WHICH HE HAD SO MUCH
POWER THROUGH HIS NEWSPAPERSAND INFLUENCE IT AN POLITICS
THAT POLITICIANS WEREUNWILLING TO CHECK ANY
BEHAVIOR THAT WERE THEPROBLEM.
IT TURNED OUT THAT ACCORDINGTO CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS, A
LOT OF POLICE WERE ON THECASE TAKING BRIBES FROM
MURDOCH'S JOURNALISTS INSUCH A WAY THAT THEY DIDN'T
HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVE TOFOLLOW ON JUST -- OBJECTIONS
TO WHETHER THERE WAS ILLEGALBEHAVIOR O YOU ARING CAN IT
TURNED OUT TOP OFFICIALS HADTO RESIGN IN THE WAKE OF THE
REVELATIONS OF HACKING IN2011 BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT
THEY ACCEPTED THOUSANDS OFDOLLARS IN THINGS LIKE MEALS,
THAT THE COMMISSIONERACCEPTED A SPA TREATMENT
WORTH OVER 13,000 POUNDSFROM A FRIEND OF REBECCA.
AND SO-- .
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOUHAVE DONE AT A SPA FOR
13,000 POUNDS.
>> APPARENTLY A VERY NICESPA.
>> Stephen: THAT IS THEHAPPIEST ENDS I HAVE EVER
HEARD OF.
