SUCKED.
(LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, THE SOUND SYSTEM WAS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM.
THERE WERE ALSO THE PEOPLE TALKING OVER IT.
SPEECHES BY DEVAL PATRICK,
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, JOAQUIN AND JULIAN HAS TROW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TWO CASTROS?
CAN WE NOW END THE DEBATE ON WHETHER THE D.E.M.S ARE SOCIALISTS, PLEASE?
(LAUGHTER) AND THEN THE HEADLINER, MICHELLE "WAIT FOR IT" OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER) OH, I WONDER HOW SHE GOT THAT GIG.
CRONY CAPITALISM, SOLYNDRA.
(LAUGHTER) SHE CAME OUT AND TALKED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CHARACTER, THEIR
LIFE TOGETHER, THEIR CHILDREN.
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.
(LAUGHTER) I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT HER SPEECH
BECAUSE IT WAS VERY GOOD.
(LAUGHTER) JIM?
>> THE FIRST LADY ABSOLUTELY DELIVERING HERE ON EVERYBODY NOTE.
>> AS YOU HEARD HER DELIVERY IT WAS JUST MASTERFUL.
>> I THINK THIS WAS... I THINK THE SPEECH OF THE CONVENTION.
>> SHE KNOCKED THIS HOUSE DOWN.
>> MICHELLE OBAMA'S SPEECH I THOUGHT WAS A BRILLIANT SPEECH,
BRILLIANTLY DELIVERED.
BUT I DIDN'T BUY A LINE OF IT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YES.
BRILLIANT SPEECH, BRILLIANTLY DELIVERED, BUT I DON'T BUY A LINE OF IT.
JIMMY?
CUT ME OFF A LINE OF IT.
>> BARACK KNOWS THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE HE'S LIVED IT.
AND HE WANTS...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ... EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY,
EVERYONE TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE'RE FROM OR WHERE
WHAT WE LOOK LIKE OR WHO WE LOVE.
YOU SEE, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
MY MOST IMPORTANT TITLE IS STILL "MOM IN CHIEF." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MY DAUGHTERS ARE STILL THE HEART OF MY HEART AND THE CENTER OF MY WORLD.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IT JUST DOESN'T RING TRUE!
(LAUGHTER) IN HERE.
IN HERE I CAN TELL THAT'S ALL BULL (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) WARM.
THE SOUL IS STIRRING (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) ROMNEY'S GOT TO GET SOME BETTER BULL (BLEEP).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE WHOLE EVENING SMACKED OF DESPERATION, FOLKS.
NO, NOT DESPERATION.
ANOTHER "D" WORD THAT MEANS TERRIBLE.
DIVERSITY.
YES.
(LAUGHTER) EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED THERE WAS BLACK PEOPLE, ASIAN PEOPLE,
LATINOS, JEWS, SIKHS, HINDUS, I THINK, I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER) AND THAT'S IN THE AUDIENCE!
ON STAGE, THE DEMOCRATS TROTTED OUT EVERY RACE, CREED, COLOR,
SEX, AND IDENTITY AND THAT'S JUST CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE TAMMY DUCKWORTH.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> MY NAME IS TAMMY DUCKWORTH.
MY FATHER SERVED IN THE ARMY AND THE MARINE CORPS.
MY MOM IS THAI AND CHINESE.
I BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST ARMY WOMEN TO FLY COMBAT MISSIONS IN IRAQ.
>> Stephen: DUCKWORTH.
FEMALE, DISABLED, THAI, CHINESE AND A VETERAN?
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S NOT A CONVENTION SPEAKER,
THAT'S DIVERSITY VOLTRON.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I TELL YOU, THE ULTIMATE SIGN OF
THE DEMOCRATS' DESPERATION WAS ALL THE SIGNS.
WHETHER THE MESSAGE WAS "MOVING FORWARD" OR "NOT MOVING
BACKWARD" OR JUST LOVING THE FIRST LADY, THESE AUDIENCE SIGNS SEEMED TO MATERIALIZE OUT OF NOWHERE!
