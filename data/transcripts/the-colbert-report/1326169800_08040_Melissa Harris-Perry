>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN
A NEW BOOK ABOUT STEREOTYPES
OF BLACK WOMEN IN AMERICA.
I'M SORRY, BLAAAAA WOMEN IN
AMERICA.
PLEASE WELCOME MELISSA
HARRIS-PERRY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY, MADAME, YOU ARE
PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL
SCIENCE AT TULANE.
YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW ON
MSNBC.
>> NOT SO BLACK HISTORY
MONTH.
>> Stephen: NOT SO BLACK
HISTORY MONTH.
DOW GET TO GO BEYOND BLACK
HISTORY MONTH.
>> MAYBE INTO MARCH WHICH IS
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH.
>> Stephen: AND YOU'RE BOTH
OF THOSE.
>> BOTH.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE RACE,
ARE YOU AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
>> MOST DAYS.
>> Stephen: MOST DAYS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HERE'S MY
PROBLEM WITH TALKING ABOUT
RACE.
DOESN'T IT DIVIDE US BY
TALKING ABOUT OUR RACE.
>> YOU KNOW, I DO THINK THAT
EXPERIENCING RACISM TENDS TO
BE A WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT
RACISM.
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
>> SO AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR
I FEEL LIKE TALKING ALWAYS
BRINGS US CLOSER TO
UNDERSTANDING RATHER THAN
DIVIDING US.
IT CAN BE TOUGH.
IT CAN BE A LITTLE
NAUSEATING.
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE
RIGHT VOLK AN LEAR TO TALK
ACROSS OUR DIFFERENCES BUT
THE TALKING IS ALWAYS BETTER
THAN THE IGNORING.
>> Stephen: THAT COULD BE A
GREAT TAG LINE FOR OUR YOUR
SHOW, IT COULD BE TOUGH, A
LITTLE NAUSEATING.
HAVE A BRAND-NEW BOOK, IT'S
CALLED SISTER CITIZENS,
SHAME, STEREOTYPE AND BLACK
WOMEN IN AMERICA.
WHAT DOW MEAN ABOUT ABOUT
SHAME AND STEREO TYPES.
WHAT ARE THE STEREOTYPES ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT OF BLACK
WOMEN IN AMERICA.
>> THERE ARE FOUR THAT I
LOOK AT.
THE JEZEBEL, THE HYPOSEXUAL
BLACK WIRJ, THE IDEA THAT
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN
AREN'T IN CONTROL OF THEIR
FERTILITY, THAT THEY JUST
HAVE BABIES, BY LOTS OF
DIFFERENT MEN ALL THE TIME
THERE IS THE MAMMY
STEREOTYPE ON DISPLAY QUITE
RECENTLY WITH FOR EXAMPLE
THE HELP FILM.
>> Stephen: GREAT MOVIE,
BASED ON A TRUE STORY.
GO AHEAD.
>> AND THEN-- YOU THROUGH ME
OFF.
>> AND THEN THERE IS THE
ANGRY BLACK WOMAN, THAT KIND
OF IRRATIONALLY ANGRY ALL
THE TIME AT ANY MOMENT JUST
MIGHT STAP, THAT ONE.
>> Stephen: YES.
TELL IT.
>> THAT WOMAN.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS SHE
CALLEDANCE SAPPHIRE.
WOW, THAT IS SPARKLELY.
OF THESE STEREOTYPE, JEZ
BELL, MAMMEE OR SAPPHIRE,
WHICH ONE ARE YOU.
BECAUSE I LIKE TO PIGEONHOLE
MY GUEST AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M
ACTUALLY THAT FOURTH
STEREOTYPE WHICH IS THE
STRONG BLACK WOMAN.
AND IN FACT THE STRONG BLACK
WOMAN IS THE ONE THAT
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OURSELVES
CREATED.
WE BORROWED A LITTLE BIT
FROM A LOT OF THESE STEREO
TYPES BUT THE FACT IS EVEN
THOUGH WE'VE SELF-CREATED
HER, SHE CAN BE JUST AS
PAINFUL, JUST AS PROBLEMATIC,
THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE
INHERENTLY STRONG, BASICALLY
BORN WITH THE CAPACITY TO
KICK ADVERSITY'S BUTT JUST
BECAUSE WE ARE BLACK AND
WOMEN.
>> Stephen: THAT SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF BURDEN AND I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE
BUT IF I COULD GENERALIZE AS
IF I DID, IT SEEMS LIKE THE
WOMAN IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY
TAKES THE GREAT BURDEN FOR
THE ABSENCE OF THE BLACK
MALE.
>> I THINK WE WANT TO BE
CAREFUL ABOUT, BECAUSE THAT
NOTION OF LIKE-- .
>> Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO
BE CAREFUL ABOUT ANYTHING
HERE.
>> BUT BLACK MEN ARE
ACTUALLY NOT ABSENT IN THIS
WAY.
>> Stephen: LIKE-- OR LIKE
THE YETI.
THERE IS LIKE HISTORY
CHANNEL SHOW LIKE FINDING
BIG FOOT.
>> FINDING THE BLACK MAN,
WHERE WAS HE.
ONE THERE IS ONE EVEN LIVING
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE
MOMENT.
>> Stephen: I HEARD THAT,
YES.
SO HOW CAN THERE BE-- I
DON'T JUDGE, MAYBE HE IS
BLACK, MAYBE HE'S NOT.
BUT IF WE DO HAVE AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT
WE HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
FIRST LADY.
>> WE DO.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T THAT
SHATTER THE STEREOTYPE.
>> I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT
NO, SHE DOESN'T
SENATE-- SHATTER THEM BUT
SHE DOES CHALLENGE THEM, AT
THE SAME TIME THAT FOR
EXAMPLE WE'RE HOLDING UP THE
HELP.
WE HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY A
CHALLENGING FIGURE IN THE
PERSON OF MICHELLE OBAMA AS
FIRST LADY AND REINFORCING
STEREOTYPES.
>> Stephen: THE HELP IS A
HISTORICAL DOCUMENT.
>> IT IS NOT.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
THAT IS HOW IT ONCE WAS.
IT WAS NEVER.
THERE WERE A SIMPLER TIME.
>> JIM CROWE WAS NEVER LIKE
BIG FUN IN THE KITCHEN.
>> Stephen: IN SOME WAYS
DON'T ALL WOMEN SAYS TER
STEREOTYPES.
>> ALL WOMEN FACE STER WHY
TYPES AND THE POINT ISN'T TO
SAY THERE IS NO OPPRESSION
OLYMPICS WHERE THINGS ARE SO
MUCH WORSE.
>> Stephen: WHO WOULD SAY IF
THERE WAS.
WHO WOULD WIN.
>> LET ME JUST SUGGEST THIS,
THE REAL POINT OF THE BOOK
ISN'T THAT THERE ARE THESE
BAD THINGS THAT THESE OTHER
FOLKS ARE DOING TO
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN.
THE REAL POINT OF THE BOOK
IS THAT IT PARTERS HOW WE
FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES.
THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN
WOMEN'S INTERNAL LIFE
EXPERIENCES ARE PART OF THE
AMERICAN STORY.
SO WHEN WE ARE LISTENING,
FOR EXAMPLE, TO THE GOP
RHETORIC ABOUT THIS
NOSTALGIA OF THIS AMERICA
WHEN THINGS WERE SIMPLER AND
BETTER, YOU CAN NEVER TELL
THAT STORY IF YOU BOTHER TO
THINK ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN
WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE.
BECAUSE THERE IS NO MOMENT
IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE IT
IS NOSTALGIC AND BETTER TO
HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BLACK
GIRL SO WE ARE PUT BLACK
WOMEN'S STORIES AT THE
CENTRE OF THE AMERICAN STORY
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE
AMERICAN STORY TAKES ON A
VERY, VERY DIFFERENT
RESONANCE AND TRAJECTORY.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE TRYING
TO DEPRESS ME.
BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING TO A
LITTLE BLACK GIRL, I GET
VERY, VERY SAD.
AND THEN I FEEL GUILTY.
>> OH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
AND THAT IS, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THIS TERM, THAT'S CALLED THE
WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.
DO YOU KNOW THAT TERM.
>> I DO KNOW THAT TERM.
>> Stephen: THAT'S YOUR NEXT
BOOK, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MELISSA HARRIS-PERRY.
THE BOOK IS SISTER CITIZEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
