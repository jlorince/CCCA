NATION, PLEASE, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, NATION, I BELIEVE YOU
ARE ALL RESTED FROM THIS
WEEKEND.
I CAN HEAR IT.
IT WAS DAYLIGHT SAVINGS, WHICH
MEANS YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE SET
YOUR CLOCKS BACK AN HOUR.
DID YOU DO THAT?
EVERYBODY DO THAT?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL
ALL RIGHT.
SUCKERS, I DIDN'T.
THAT MEANS I'M LIVING ONE HOUR
IN THE FUTURE.
( LAUGHTER )
LOOK AT MY WATCH.
LOOK AT MY WATCH.
I NEVER CHANGED IT.
OKAY.
I NEVER CHANGED IT.
SO FOR ME, IT'S 12:32.
I GAMED THE SYSTEM.
I FOUND THE WORM HOLE.
NOBEL PRIZE IN TIME TRAVEL
PLEASE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, THE
FUTURE IS SO MUCH BETTER.
( LAUGHTER )
I'M SITTING HERE ALL THE WAY IN
TUESDAY.
WHILE YOU LOSERS STILL HAVE A
BAD CASE OF THE MONDAYS.
( LAUGHTER )
WAIT, BUT WAIT.
WAIT!
IF I TRAVELED INTO THE FUTURE,
THAT MEANS THERE'S A PAST ME
THAT'S LIVING IN YOUR PRESENCE.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE OF ME
BECAUSE TWO OF ME WOULD
DEPRECIATE MY RESALE VALUE.
( LAUGHTER )
QUICK, JAY, JAY, GET OUT HERE.
JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
JAY, JAY, JAY, ARE YOU CARRYING
THE GUN I ISSUED TO ALL INTERNS
ON THEIR FIRST DAY?
>> YES.

CREDIT.
I NEED YOU THE SHOOT THE PAST
STEPHEN WHEN HE SHOWS UP ONE
HOUR FROM NOW.

BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY PAST
STEPHEN POSING AS FUTURE
STEPHEN?
>> Stephen: WAIT, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.
I'M THE FUTURE STEPHEN.
>> BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD SAY
IF YOU WERE PAST STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: STOP, STOP!
DAMMIT.
THIS IS TOO MUCH POWER FOR
MORTAL MAN TO WIELD.
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THE
IMPORTANCE OF DAYLIGHT SAVINGS
TIME.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, FOLKS, I'M SORRY.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SET MY
WATCH BACK TO AN HOUR AGO AND
RETURN TO MY OWN TIME SCAPE.
JIMMY, CAN I PLEASE HAVE SOME
TIME TRAVELING MUSIC, PLEASE.
WOW.
OKAY.
THERE I AM.
I'M IN THE PAST.

( LAUGHTER )
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT WE WORE.
JAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
WITH THAT GUN?
>> FUTURE YOU TOLD ME THAT HE'D
GIVE ME A COLLEGE CREDIT IF I
SHOT YOU.
>> Stephen: THAT BASTARD!
OKAY, JAY, I'LL GIVE YOU TWO
COLLEGE CREDITS TO SHOOT HIM.
JUST WAIT AN HOUR AND SHOOT HIM
WHEN HE'S GOING TO HIS CAR.
HE'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING.
>> OKAY.
