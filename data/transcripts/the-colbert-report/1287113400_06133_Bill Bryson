EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
NEW BOOK ABOUT LIFE AT HOME.
GIVEN THE FORECLOSURE RATE, I
ASSUME IT'S FICTION.
PLEASE WELCOME BILL BRYSON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MR. BRYSON, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
NOW, YOU ARE A VERY POPULAR
AUTHOR OF NON-FICTION, AND YOUR
LATEST BOOK IS CALLED "AT HOME:
A SHORT HISTORY OF PRIVATE LIFE.
" YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS SORT OF
LIKE A HISTORY OF THE WORLD TOLD
BY WALKING AROUND YOUR HOME,
CORRECT?
>> SORT OF.
SORT OF.
>> Stephen: YOUR WORDS, SIR.
>> THE BACK-UP TO IT IS WE
PROVED TO ENGLAND IN 2003.
I WAS SITTING AROUND OUR HOUSE,
WHICH IS AN OLD PARSONAGE IN
NORFOLK, AND I JUST DECIDED TO
DAWN ON ME.
I WAS LOOKING FOR AN IDEA FOR A
BOOK.
I REALIZED I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE.
I HEARD A REFERENCE ON THE RADIO
TO ROOM AND BOARD.
AND I THOUGHT, I'VE BEEN HEARING
THAT EXPRESSION ALL MY LIFE,
WHAT IS BOARD?
>>
>> Stephen: BECAUSE LIFE IN
THE OLDEN DAYS WAS SO BORING.
>> THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER BUT NOT
THE RIGHT ONE.
>> Stephen: I'D RATHER HAVE A
GOOD ONE THAN THE RIGHT ONE.
>> AND I NOTICED THESE BUTTONS
OUR OUR JACKET.
THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOURS ARE
LIKE.
>> Stephen: IF I GET FAT
ENOUGH, THESE BLOW OUT AND
EREPLACE IT.
I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT THAT'S FOR.
>> WHY DO WE HAVE POINTLESS
BUTTONS?
SO ANYWAY, THE IDEA WAS I JUST
THOUGHT, I MIGHT JUST WALK
AROUND THE HOUSE, GO FROM ROOM
TO ROOM IN MY OWN HOME AND TRY
AND WRITE A HISTORY OF THE WORLD
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EACH
ROOM.
>> Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE QUESTIONING THE COMMON
THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT, THE
THINGS YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED
YOU'RE QUESTIONING.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: BUT IF YOU
QUESTION THE THINGS WE TAKE FOR
GRANTED, YOU MIGHT LEARN
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
>> WELL, EVERY TIME YOU QUESTION
ANYTHING, YOU MIGHT LEARN
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO
KNOW.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY I DON'T
QUESTION MY LIFE.
>> BECAUSE IT IS EVERYDAY LIFE,
BECAUSE WE DO TAKE IT FOR
GRANTEDDED, IT IS... IT SEEMS TO
BE ALMOST INDISTINCTIVELY,
INNATELY INTERESTING.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DID I NOT
KNOW ABOUT MY HOUSE.
I OPEN THE DOOR AND I'M IN MY
HOPE.
>> FIRST ROOM YOU COME TO IS THE
HALL.
THE HALL IS A COMPLETELY
UNIMPORTANT ROOM.
IT'S A SORT OF ENTRYWAY INTO THE
HOUSE.
>> Stephen: THE MAIL IS ON THE
TABLE THERE.
>> ORIGINALLY THE HALL WAS VERY
IMPORTANT.
THERE WAS ONE ROOM WHEN ANGELO
SACKSONS CAME INTO ENGLAND, THEY
BROUGHT THE NEW HOUSE, HALL
HOUSE.
THE HOUSE WAS THE HALL.
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL OF
THESE WORDS IN ENGLISH WITH HALL
IN THEM THAT MAKE HALL SOUND
LIKE A IMPORTANT PLACE, CARNEGIE
HALL, STUDY HALL, HALL OF FAME,
HALLS OF MONTEZUMA, ALL OF THAT.
SO HALL WAS A BIG SPACE.
THEN AS HOUSES PROLIFERATED,
THEY WENT OUTWARDS AND UPWARDS,
THE HALL ITSELF SHRANK.
IT BECAME THE KIND OF ENTRYWAY
TO THE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE THE
NOTHING ROOM NOW.
>> IT IS THE NOTHING ROOM.
>> Stephen: IT'S THE ROOM
THAT'S NOT A ROOM.
IT'S THE ROOM THAT GETS YOU TO
THE ROOM YOU WANT TO GET.
TO
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: IF YOU'RE OUT IN
THE HALL, YOU'RE OUT NOWHERE.
YOU'RE LIKE EXILED.
BUT BEFORE THAT IS THE PLACE YOU
WANTED TO BE.
>> EXACTLY.
YOU'VE GOT IT COVERED.
>> Stephen: I'M CONFUSED, BUT
GO AHEAD.
YOU'RE TURNING MY HOUSE UPSIDE
DOWN.
SO ABOUT WHAT ABOUT BEDROOMS?
ARE THOSE NEW?
>> WELL, BEDROOMS... ORIGINALLY
IN THE HALL HOUSES IN THE MIDDLE
AGES, THERE WERE NO BEDROOMS.
EVERYBODY LIVED AND SLEPT
TOGETHER.
IT WAS ONE BIG...
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU MAKE
MORE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF
EVERYBODY ELSE?
>> YOU MADE MORE PEOPLE IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY ELSE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> APPARENTLY.
THEY MADE MORE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: SO THEY WEREN'T AS
BORING AS I THOUGHT.
THEY WERE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT.
PERHAPS YOU COULD WAGER WHILE IT
WAS GOING ON.
( LAUGHTER )
>> THERE WAS A GREAT... ALL OUR
IDEAS OF PRIVACY, A LOT OF THEM
ARE VERY, VERY RECENT.
RIGHT UP UNTIL ABOUT 1800, IT
WAS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON FOR A
SERVANT TO SLEEP IN PEOPLE'S
BEDROOMS.
>> Stephen: LIKE AT THE FOOT
OF THE BED.
>> AT THE FOOT OF THE BED.
>> LIKE A SPANIEL.
>> ENGLISH DIARIES, IT WAS CLEAR
IN DIARIES THAT THEER IS VANTD
WAS AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED.
SO WHATEVER THEY WERE GETTING UP
TO IN THE BED, SHE WAS THERE TO
LISTEN TO IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: PERHAPS.
NOW, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
YOU SAY THAT WE ARE USED TO
COMFORT NOW, AND COMFORT IS A
NEW THING.
>> WELL, UNTIL ABOUT THE TIME OF
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, COMFORT
WAS JUST SOMETHING YOU GAVE TO
WOUNDED PEOPLE, DISTRESSED
PEOPLE.
THE IDEA OF BEING COMFORTABLE IN
A HOUSE, JUST COMFORTABLE IN AN
ENVIRONMENT DIDN'T EXIST BECAUSE
IT WASN'T A CONCEPT THAT PEOPLE
RECOGNIZED.
>> Stephen: IS IT A BAD THING?
>> NO, NO, COMFORT IS A GREAT
THING.
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT.
>> Stephen: OUR MODERN SENSE
OF COMFORT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR
THE ENVIRONMENT.
WE INDULGE OURSELVES IN WAYS
THAT MIGHT HARM THE PLANET.
>> IT'S A COMPLICATED POINT, BUT
IT IS THAT ALL OF... WE'VE SPENT
HUGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY TRYING TO
MAKE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE,
NATURAL IMPULSE.
IT'S THE MOST NATURAL THING IN
THE WORLD.
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IT, WE
THIS USE UP A LOT OF STUFF,
RESOURCES.
OF ALL THE ENERGY THAT'S BEEN
PRODUCED INTO THE INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION, HALF OF IT HAS BEEN
CONSUMED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS,
BECAUSE WE USE STUFF SO
INTENSIVELY NOW.
>> WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT BEING
COMFORTABLE.
WHEN WE RUIN THE PLANET, WE'LL
COME UP WITH A WAY TO BE
COMFORTABLE IN THE AFTER SCAPE.
>> WE BETTER HOPE SO BECAUSE
THAT MAY BE THE POSITION WE'RE
IN.
>> Stephen: THE BOOK IS CALLED
"AT HOME."
