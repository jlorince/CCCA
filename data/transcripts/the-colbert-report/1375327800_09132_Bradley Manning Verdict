WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
FOLKS, I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP A
LEVEL HEAD.
YOU KNOW I FOR ONE ALWAYS TRY TO
KEEP A LEVEL HEAD BUT EVEN I AM
ENRAGED BY THIS BRADLEY MANNING
TRIAL.
FIRST OF ALL, THAT HE HAD A
TRIAL.
THOSE PRISONERS IN GITMO MUST BE
DYING TO KNOW HOW HE WRANGLED
THAT SWEET DEAL.
YOU MAY REMEMBER BRADLEY MANNING
AS THE WIKILEAKER WHO RELEASED
THE INFAMOUS COLLATERAL MURDER
VIDEO OR PERHAPS FOR BEING THE
LEAST ATHLETIC MANNING BROTHER.
HIT THE WHEATIES.
NOW, SINCE HIS ARREST THREE
YEARS AGO MANNING HAS BEEN HELD
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR 23
HOURS A DAY, FORCED TO SLEEP
NAKED WITHOUT PILLOWS AND SHEETS
ON HIS BED.
BUT I SAY HE DESERVES IT.
FOR PETE'S SAKE THE GUY REVEALED
THAT THE UNITED STATES TORTURES.
PARTLY THROUGH HIS DOCUMENT LEAK
BUT MOSTLY BY HOW WE TORTURED
HIM.
WELL, BRACE YOURSELVES, FOLKS
BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE JUDGE IN
THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL HANDED
DOWN A SHOCKING DECISION.
>> BRADLEY MANNING IS NOT
GUILTY.
NOT GUILTY OF AIDING THE ENEMY.
THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE AGAINST
HIM.
AND ONE THAT CARRIES WITH IT A
POSSIBLE LIFE SENTENCE.
THAT WON'T HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
MANNING WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF
THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE: AIDING
THE ENEMY.
AND EVEN MORE SHOCKING, HE WAS
ALSO FOUND NOT GUILTY OF
SHOOTING TRAYVON MARTIN.
EVIDENTLY, NO ONE IS GUILTY OF
THAT ONE.
NOW, FOLKS, THEY DID CONVICT HIM
ON 20 OTHER COUNTS, INCLUDING
VIOLATING THE ESPIONAGE ACT OF
1917.
AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE
GRATEFUL FOR PRESIDENT WILSON'S
FORWARD-THINKING STANCE ON CYBER
CRIME.
OKAY.
FIGHTING AL KAISER.
BUT JUST LISTEN TO THE SLAP ON
THE WRIST THE JUDGE COULD BE
GIVING MANNING.
>> IF YOU TAKE THE SECOND AND
THIRD CHARGES WHICH HAVE A
NUMBER OF SPECIFICATIONS
INCLUDED IN ALL OF THEM, IT
COULD AMOUNT TO A TOTAL SENTENCE
OF 154 YEARS.
>> Stephen: 154 YEARS?
THAT IS NOTHING.
I MEAN, THE GUY'S ONLY 25.
HE COULD BE OUT IN TIME TO SEE
HIS GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GRAND
KIDS PLAY WITH HIS BONES.
BUT HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET,
FOLKS.
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET.
MANNING IS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF
AIDING THE ENEMY.
BUT HE IS FOUND GUILTY OF
ESPIONAGE.
SO THEN WHO WAS HE SPYING FOR
WHEN HE TOLD US WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT WAS DOING?
OH, MY GOD!
HE WAS WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
OH, MY GOD.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
MAKE SENSE.
WE WERE PAYING HIS SALARY.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I'M NOT
SURPRISED.
I NEVER TRUSTED THAT BUNCH.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO THE
INDIANS, RIGHT?
I MEAN, JOHNNY DEPP ALONE.
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW WHO MANNING
WAS FEEDING ALL THE GOVERNMENT
SECRETS TO, I MEAN, SOMEBODY
SHOULD BE KEEPING AN EYE ON
THESE PEOPLE.
OH, THEY ARE?
OH,
