>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I HOPE YOU CAN TELL AT HOME,
THESE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARE
TRUE BELIEVERS.
MEMBERS OF THE NATION AND HEROES
ONE AND ALL.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, I
DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I AM
UN-FOND OF THE U.N.
THESE DAGS HAMMER SCOLDS ARE
HELL BENT ON TAKING AWAY OUR
GUNS AND THEN FORCING US TO
SPEAK ESPERANTO.
YOU CAN HAVE MY GUNS WHEN I PRY
THEM FROM MY MALVARMAJ MANOJ
MORTITAJ.
AND I MEAN THAT.
BUT NOW THE U.N. HAS DONE
SOMETHING TRULY UNFORGIVABLE.
>> THE U.N. HAS A NEW SOLUTION
TO FIGHT HUNGER: BUGS.
>> THE U.N. SAYS CREATURES LIKE
SCORPIONS, CICADAS AND LOCUSTS
ARE A HEALTHY SOURCE OF FAT,
PROTEIN AND FIBER.
>> Stephen: THE U.N. BULLIES
WANT TO MAKE US EAT A BUG.
WHAT'S NEXT?
SOLVE THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS
THROUGH SUSTAINABLE SWIRLIES?
AND FOLKS, I FOR ONE DO NOT BUY
THE U.N. CLAIMS THAT, QUOTE,
MINI-LIVESTOCK OFFER LIVELIHOOD
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH URBAN AND
RURAL PEOPLE.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
MINI-LIVESTOCK.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
ACCORDING TO THE U.N., ALL YOU
NEW YORKERS WITH BED BUGS ARE
TECHNICALLY RANCHERS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WELL, FOLKS, YOU WILL NEVER
CATCH ME EATING BUGS.
I DON'T EVEN EAT GUMMY WORMS.
I JUST USE THEM TO CATCH SWEDISH
FISH.
AND I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY TO
THE U.N.
YOU FIRST, GENTLEMEN, BECAUSE
FROM WHAT I HEAR, YOUR DELEGATES
ARE SHUTTLED BY FLEETS OF
BENTLEYS AND MERCEDES BENZES TO
DINE AT UPSCALE SPOTS LIKE
HARRY'S BAR AND CIPRIANI WHERE
I'M PRETTY SURE THEIR COQ AU
