(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, LAST WEEK, MY GOOD FRIEND
KARL ROVE POSED AN INNOCENTQUESTION -- DOES HILLARY
CLINTON HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE?
AND EVER SINCE KARL FLOATED THISIDEA OR "DROPPED A FLOATER" AS
WE SAY IN THE PUNDIT GAME, THEREPUBLICAN PARTY HAS FACED
ACCUSATIONS THEY ARE A BUNCH OFSCAREDY CATS.
>> THE REPUBLICANS ARE SO AFRAIDOF A HILLARY CLINTON CANDIDACY
THEY HOPE TO TALK HER OUT OFRUNNING.
>> KARL ROVE IS VERY MUCH AFRAIDOF HILLARY CLINTON.
>> THIS IS SUCH A BUNCH OFNONSENSE AND I THINK IT
DEMONSTRATES HOW UTTERLY AFRAIDTHEY ARE OF HER.
>> Stephen: RIDICULOUS.
WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF HILLARYCLINTON.
IF WE WERE, WHY WOULD BYLAUGHING LIKE THIS?
(STARTS OUT LAUGHING, ENDS UPSOBBING)
(LAUGHTER)
BESIDES, HILLARY IS THE ONEWHO'S SCARED, JUST ASK R.N.C.
CHAIRMAN AND HARRY POTTERINCANTATION REINCE PRIEBUS!
JIM, JIM, ACCIO CLIP!
>> IS SHE THE CANDIDATE THAT YOUAS THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY MUST FEAR?
>> NO, I DON'T FEAR.
I THINK HILLARY IS A KNOWNPRODUCT.
GIVEN THE MONTH SHE JUST HAD, IDOUBT SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT
IN 2016.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I BELIEBUSPRIEBUS.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, WHY WOULD HILLARY RUN?
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, SHEFACED NEW BENGHAZI ALLEGATIONS,
RETURN OF MONICA LEWINSKY, KARLROVE SPECULATING ON HER BRAIN
DAMAGE AND THE RUMORS THAT THEONLY WAY SHE GOT INTO THE WHITE
HOUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BYSLEEPING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)A LIE?
PROBABLY.
BUT ALL THOSE QUESTIONS OFCHARACTER --
(APPLAUSE)-- ALL THOSE QUESTIONS OF
CHARACTER HAVE TO PUT A STRAINON HER.
I KNOW COMING UP WITH THEM PUT ASTRAIN ON ME.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
SOUNDS FUN BUT THIS ISN'T THE'90s WHEN REPUBLICANS PAMPERED
THE CLINTONS BY MERELY ACCUSINGTHEM OF MURDERING VINCE FOSTER,
ONE OF THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS.
THIS IS 2014, AND POLITICS AREREALLY DIRTY NOW.
TAKE THE MISSISSIPPI SENATE RACEWHERE JUST THIS WEEKEND A
CONSERVATIVE BLOGGER WENT INTO ANURSING HOME, PHOTOGRAPHED THE
BED RIDDEN WIFE OF REPUBLICANSENATOR THAD COCHRAN WITHOUT
PERMISSION AND POSTED THE IMAGEONLINE.
IF THAT'S WHAT CONSERVATIVES AREWILLING TO DO TO EACH OTHER,
JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY'REWILLING TO  DO WITH HILLARY'S
SECRET BED-RIDDEN WIFE.
NOW I'M NOT SAYINGMRS. CLINTON'S IN A LONG-TERM
COMMITTED LOVING RELATIONSHIPWITH A MATURE AND HANDSOME WOMAN
NAMED DIANE.
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S OUT THERENOW AND IF SHE DENIES IT,
HOW IS DIANE GONNA FEEL? I'MMEAN, SHE'S SO SICK.
SO YOU'D BETTER THINK TWICE,HILLARY. AFTER ALL, THE ELECTION
IS STILL TWO YEARS AWAY, ANDWE'VE ALREADY POPPED OPEN A CAN
METAPHORICAL WHOOP-ASS.
>> KARL ROVE MAY HAVE THROWN THEFIRST PUNCH.
>> LET'S REMEMBER, IF SHE GOESINTO THE POLITICAL FRAY, INTO
THAT RING, THE GLOVES ARE OFFAND THE BELL IS RINGING.
>> I THINK WHAT KARL ROVE DID INTHAT LITTLE COMMENT IS HE GAVE A
REAL SIGNAL TO THE CLINTONS THATWE'RE GOING TO PLAY, GLOVES WILL
BE OFF, DON'T THINK WE'LL GIVESPECIAL TREATMENT TO
MRS. CLINTON BECAUSE SHE'S AWOMAN.
>> Stephen: UH-UH!
DING DING!
GLOVES ARE COMING OFF!
THIS IS HAND TO HAND COMBAT ANDTHE G.O.P. WILL NOT BE THE JAY-Z
TO HILLARY'S SOLANGE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOR ONE THING, REPUBLICANS WOULD
NEVER GET INTO AN ELEVATOR WITHTHAT MANY BLACK PEOPLE!
(LAUGHTER)FOR ANOTHER, JUST BECAUSE
HILLARY'S A WOMAN DOESN'T MEANTHEY'RE GOING TO PULL ANY
POLITICAL PUNCHES -- OR PUNCHES,PERIOD -- BECAUSE PUNCHING WOMEN
IS NOW OKAY, RIGHT TV PEOPLE?
>> IF A WOMAN HITS YOU, TO ME,YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO HIT HER
BACK.
>> MY WIFE IS AMERICAN INDIAN,AND SHE HAS THIS SWITCH THAT
GOES OFF, AND I GO, OKAY, YOUCAN HIT ME 12 TIMES.
I GO, ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THENAFTER 12, I GO --
>> YOU'RE SAYING YOU HIT YOURWIFE?
>> I'VE HIT MY WIFE.
I GOT BIT BY A WOMAN ON THECOLLAR BONE AND WOULDN'T LET GO.
I WENT -- IT WAS THE ONLY WAY ICOULD GET HER OFF!
OTHERWISE, I WAS GOING TO DIE!
>> Stephen: HEY, YOU CAN'TBLAME BOB FOR PUNCHING A WOMAN
FOR BITING HIS COLLAR BONE.
I MEAN, HE'S CLEARLY DELICIOUS.
ONCE SHE GOT A TASTE OFWELL-MARBLED BECKEL, THERE'S NO
WAY SHE WAS GOING TO STOP!
THAT MEAT IS TENDER, HE'SMARINATING IN HIS OWN SADNESS.
THE POINT IS, IF WE'RE GOING TOSTOP HILLARY, NOTHING IS OUT OF
BOUNDS.
WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY VICIOUSTO HER, BECAUSE THE ONLY
ALTERNATIVE IS RUNNING ACANDIDATE PEOPLE LIKE.
JIM, WHO DO WE HAVE ON THEBENCH?
>> SENATOR RAND PAUL IS THEEARLY FRONTRUNNER FOR
REPUBLICANS IN 2016.
>> MIKE HUCKABEE JUMPED TO THEHEAD OF THE PACK.
>> TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY.
CRIS CHRISTIE
JEB BUSH, RICK SANTORUM, BOBBYJINDAL
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO TALKING2016
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD...
(LAUGHTER)WE'VE GOT TO HIT HER HARD!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
