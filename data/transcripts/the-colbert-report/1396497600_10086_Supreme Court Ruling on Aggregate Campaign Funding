NOW, NATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'MA HUGE FAN OF THE FIVE
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THESUPREME COURT.
THEY'RE LIKE A JUDICIAL VERSIONOF ONE DIRECTION IN THAT ALL
THEIR RULINGS GO IN ONEDIRECTION.
( LAUGHTER )BUT TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS
BETRAYED BY THE CUTE ONE, CHIEFJUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS BECAUSE IN
AN ACT OF JUDAS-PRUDENCE, HEVOTED TO UPHOLD OBAMACARE, AND
THAT BROKE MY HEART.
AND EVEN WORSE, UNDER OBAMACARE,I AM COVERED FOR CARDIAC
BREAKAGE.
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.
MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK.
>> BREAKING NEWS ON THE SUPREMECOURT, CHANGING THE RULES AGAIN
WHEN IT COMES TO CAMPAIGNCONTRIBUTIONS.
>> YOU CAN NOW GIVE TO AS MANYCANDIDATES AS YOU WANT.
THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCHTOTAL MONEY ANY INDIVIDUAL
PERSON CAN SPEND.
THE COURT'S MAJORITY OPINION,WRITTEN BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE
JOHN ROBERTS SAID MONEY ISSPEECH AND THAT YOU CAN'T LIMIT
HOW MUCH AN INDIVIDUAL PERSONCAN SPEND.
HE SAID IF THE FIRST AMENDMENTCAN ABIDE BY FLAG BURNING, NAZI
PARADES, AND PROTESTS ATMILITARY FUNERALS IT CAN ABIDE
BY PEOPLE SPENDING AS MUCH MONEYAS THEY WANT TO SUPPORT THE
CANDIDATES OF THEIR CHOICES.
>> Stephen:  WELL SAID--UNLIMITED CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
ARE JUST AS GOOD AS NAZIS.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, THE CASE IN QUESTION IS
"McCUTCHEON V. F.E.C.," AND INA 5-4 DECISION, THE COURTS
ELIMINATED THE $123,200 CAP ONTHE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN DONATE,
WHICH IS GREAT FOR ALL OF US, IFBY "US" YOU MEAN THE 591 PEOPLE
WHO GAVE THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLEDONATION IN 2012.
AND IF YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US, YOUREALLY SHOULD BE.
( LAUGHTER )WE HAVE GREAT PARTIES, TWO OF
THEM.
FOLKS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT THEFREEDOM OF SPEECH.
AGGREGATE CAPS UNFAIRLY LIMITHOW LOUD MY CASH COULD TALK
INSPECTOR THE ANTIQUATEDASSUMPTION GIVING POLITICIANS
GREASY PAPER BAGS FULL OF MONEYIS SOMEHOW A CORRUPTING
INFLUENCE.
BUT JUSTICE ROBERTS TEACHES USGOVERNMENT REGULATION MAY NOT
TARGET THE GENERAL GRATITUDE ACANDIDATE MAY FEEL TOWARDS THOSE
WHO SUPPORT HIM OR THE POLITICALACCESS SUCH SUPPORT MAY AFFORD.
INGRATIATION AND ACCESS ARE NOTCORRUPTION.
IN FACT, THOSE THINGS DON'T EVENHAVE THE APPEARANCE OF
CORRUPTION.
DID YOU GET THAT?
INGRATIATION AND ACCESS ARE NOTCORRUPTION.
SO IF YOU THINK LEGISLATORSLINING UP TO LISTEN TO
MEGADONORS LIKE THE KOCHBROTHERS OR GEORGE SOROS APPEARS
CORRUPT, GOOD NEWS-- JOHNROBERTS HAS RULED YOU DON'T
THINK THAT.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, ROBERTS KNOWS THERE'S ONLY
ONE REAL TYPE OF CORRUPTION--QUID PRO QUO.
OR THE DIRECT EXCHANGE OF ANOFFICIAL ACT FOR MONEY, AND
THAT IS EASY TO PROVE, ASLONG AS POLITICS REMEMBER TO
HOLD ON TO THEIR ITEMIZEDCORRUPTION RECEIPTS.
