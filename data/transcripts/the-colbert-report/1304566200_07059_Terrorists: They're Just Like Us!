AND GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
WHO AM I TO FIGHT THE POWER OF
LOVE?
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS
SINCE A NAVY SEAL TEAM TOOK OUT
BIN LADEN, DECAPTIATED AL QAEDA
AND CHANGED THE FACE OF THE WAR
ON TERROR.
AND I JUST CAN IN THE GET ENOUGH
OF ALL THE JUICY GOSSIP.
HERE IS THE 411 ON MR. 911.
HE LIVED IN A BIG MANSION.
HE PEAKED IN 2002 AND HE'S BEEN
IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW EVER
SINCE.
HE IS BASICALLY A FUNDAMENTALIST
LINDSAY LOHAN.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOW -- GET IT -- NOW HIS
COMPOUND IS SWARMING WITH
REPORTERS SO WE'RE LEARNING ALL
THE BEHIND OF SCENES SECRETS OF
THIS FUGITIVE'S LIFESTYLE OF
GLAM ON THE LAMB.
IT TURNS OUT TERRORISTS ARE JUST
LIKE US.
>> WE LEARN THE DETAILS OF WHAT
WENT ON BEHIND THE WALLS.
>> THEY HAD A LOT OF BULK FOOD
IN THE PLACE AND NESTLE
PRODUCTS.
>> Stephen: THAT IS SOME SWEET
PRODUCT PLACEMENT FOR NESTLE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY BRAND
TO GET THE COVETED BIN LADEN
BUMP.
JIM?
>> A LOCAL SHOP KEEPER SAID THE
BIN LADEN'S APPARENTLY LIKED
COKE AND PEPSI.
THEY HAD IT DELIVERED IN BULK.
>> COKE AND PEPSI, WE'RE AT COLA
WAR, PICK A SIDE.
I HAVE TO SAY NO MOUNTAIN DEW?
I THOUGHT BIN LADEN WAS AN
ISLAMIC EXTREMIST.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYHOO, WE ALSO GOT AN EXCLUSIVE
LOOK AT THE BIN LADEN'S POSH
ABBOTTABAD NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIDING
IN ANY MORE PLAIN SIGHT THAN
THIS.
AROUND THREE SIDES FARMER'S
FIELDS.
CAB BADGES, MARIJUANA PLANTS
RIGHT UP TO THE SIDE OF
COMPOUND.
>> Stephen: MARIJUANA?
NO WONDER NO ONE KNEW HE WAS
THERE.
THEY WERE MORE BAKED THAN A
TANDOORI CHICKEN.
IF SOMEONE SAID I THINK I SAW
BIN LADEN SOMEONE WOULD SAY
DUDE, YOU ARE BEING PARANOID.
HAND ME THE NESTLE.
I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE THE
DETAILS.
I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF OBL.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT WHERE -- WHERE IS THE
PAPARAZZI?
WHERE IS THE PHOTOS?
>> THE PERFECT -- PRESIDENT HAS
DECIDED NOT TO RELEASE ANY OF
THESE POST DEATH PICTURES OF
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SEE
THE VISUAL PROOF OF OSAMA BIN
LADEN DEAD.
>> PEOPLE WANT PROOF.
>> THEY COULD PHOTOSHOP OUT THE
PART THAT IS BLOWN AWAY.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
GENERAL LEE GIFFORD IS RIGHT
JUST PHOTOSHOP OUT THE PART THAT
IS BLOWN AWAY OR AT LEAST, YOU
KNOW, USE A LITTLE RED EYE
REDUCTION.
[LAUGHTER]
WE AMERICANS, WE WORLD, WE WANT
THESE PHOTOS.
REAL JOURNALISTS OUT THERE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO
