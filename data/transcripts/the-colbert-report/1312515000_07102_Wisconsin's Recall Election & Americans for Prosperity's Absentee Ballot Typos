OF COURSE, FOLKS, PEOPLE ARE
ALWAYS ASKING ME HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU RAISED.
WELL, I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR A LONG TIME AT LEAST, BUT
TRUST ME, IT WILL BE WELL SPENT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NOW...
NOW, ONE PLACE, ONE PLACE A LOT
OF THE OTHER PACS ARE SPENDING
MONEY IS ON THE WISCONSIN STATE
SENATOR RECALL ELECTION THAT WAS
TRIGGERED OVER GOVERNOR SCOTT
WALKER'S ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN.
ESTIMATES OF TOTAL SPENDING IN
WISCONSIN HAVE REACHED $25
MILLION.
HOLY SCHLITZ.
AND SOME OF THAT CASH COMES FROM
MY PAC PALS AT AMERICANS FOR
PROSPERITY, FUNDED BY
BILLIONAIRE INDUSTRIALIST
CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH.
THEY'RE LIKE THE OLSEN TWINS OF
FACTORY RUN-OFFS.
AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY HAS
EVEN SENT OUT THESE ACTUAL
HELPFUL ABSENTEE BALLOT
APPLICATIONS TO DEMOCRATIC
DISTRICTS.
NOW, THEY HAD TO RUSH THESE TO
PRINT, SO SOME PEOPLE COMPLAINED
ABOUT INACCURACIES, BUT IT'S
MINOR STUFF, LIKE INSTEAD OF
INSTRUCTING DO YOU SEND YOUR
BALLOT TO THE LOCAL MUNICIPAL
CLERK, WHERE BALLOTS ARE
OFFICIALLY COLLECTED, THE
ADDRESS ON THIS IS "ABSENTEE
BALLOT APPLICATION PROCESSING
CENTER," WHICH, AND THIS IS
INTERESTING, DOES NOT EXIST.
BUT I'M SURE THE KOCH BROTHERS
WERE GOING TO HAND DELIVER THOSE
BALLOTS TO THE PROPER LOCATION
ONCE THEY'VE SEPARATED THEM FROM
THE MAIL SENT TO WISCONSIN
FAMILY ASSOCIATION AND WISCONSIN
RIGHT TO LIFE, THE TWO OTHER
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS TO USE THAT
ANONYMOUS PO BOX.
BECAUSE WHY ELSE WOULD THEY GO
TO THE TROUBLE TO GIVE
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS HELPFUL
INSTRUCTIONS LIKE, "MAIL IN YOUR
COMPLETED ABSENTEE BALLOT, WHICH
MUST BE RECEIVED BY YOUR CITY
CLERK BEFORE AUGUST 11TH."
HERE'S A LITTLE RHYME TO HELP
YOU REMEMBER WHEN IT'S DUE.
ON AUGUST 11th, MAKE YOUR
SELECTION.
THAT'S JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE
ACTUAL ELECTION.
OKAY.
THAT STICKS IN THE BRAIN.
NOTHING NEFARIOUS HERE.
AS AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY'S
STATE DIRECTOR EXPLAINED, IT WAS
REALLY JUST A TYPO.
A TYPO.
I ACCIDENTALLY PUT 11 WHEN I
MEAN 9 ALL THE TIME BECAUSE 1
AND 9 ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
ON THE KEYBOARD.
SO WHO CARES WHETHER THEY TYPED
9 OR 11.
THE POINT IS AMERICANS FOR
PROSPERITY AND I WANT
WISCONSINITES TO VOTE SOME TIME
IN AUGUST.
BUT IF YOU STILL DON'T TRUST
THEM, DON'T SEND YOUR BALLOTS TO
THE KOCH BROTHERS.
SEND IT TO SANTA AT THE NORTH
POLE U.S.A.
HE'LL GET IT TO THE RIGHT
PEOPLE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
