WITH US, THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHENSTEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK
YOU SO MUCH, GOOD TO HAVEYOU WITH US.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOUCAN FEEL THE ENERGY IN THE
ROOM, I KNOW THESE PEOPLECAME TO FIGHT FOR WHAT'S RIGHT
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: FOLKS, I
CERTAINLY HOPE YOU ALL HAD AGREAT WEEKEND.
I DID.
I WAS IN VATICAN CITY FOR ALITTLE SAINT-MAKING FESTIVAL
CALLED POPECHELLA(LAUGHTER)
JUST LIKE COACHELLA, IT HADA PARTY ATMOSPHERE AND A
LACK OF CONTRACEPTION.
(LAUGHTER)EVERY ONE WAS THERE TO
CELEBRATE ONE THING, TWOTHINGS.
(LAUGHTER)>> JIM?
>> SOME CALLED IT THE DAY OFFOUR POPES, POPE FRANCIS AND
HIS PREDECESSOR BENEDICT XVIAT THE CEREMONY THIS MORNING
WERE TWO GIANTS OF THECHURCH, JOHN PAUL II AND
JOHN XXIII WERE DECLAREDSAINTS.
>> IT IS AN EVENT THAT MAYWELL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
IN EFFECT FOUR POPES IN THESAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHTTHERE NO SO MANY POPES YOU
COULD NOT SWING A DEAD POPEWITHOUT HITTING ONE.
NOW KNOW SURPRISE THESE GUYSWERE SAINTED.
JOHN XXIII'S MODERNIZED THECHURCH, SECOND VATICAN
COUNCIL AND JOHN PAUL IIFOUGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM BUT
MORE IMPORTANTLY WAS ANHONORARY HARLEM GLOBETROTTER.
(APPLAUSE)>> AND I BELIEVE-- I
BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE THATTHEIR UNDEFEATED RECORD IS
THE REAL MIRACLE.
(LAUGHTER)>> AND FOLKS, WHEN YOU ARE
THERE, IT IS HARD TOEXPLAIN, BUT IT FELT AS IF
THESE DEPARTED POPES WERE INST. PETER'S SQUARE WITH YOU
BECAUSE PARTS OF THEM WERE.
>> POPE FRANCIS HAD RELICS FROMEACH OF THE PONTIFFS.
>> THE RELIC OF JOHN XXIIIIS A PIECE OF HIS SKIN.
AND THE RELIC OF JOHN PAULII IS HIS BLOOD IN A VIAL.
>> Stephen: SKIN AND BLOOD,WHY WOULD THE VATICAN
WANT-- THEY'RE BUILDING AFRANKEN-POPE!
(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS IT WAS A MONUMENTAL DAYTHAT BROUGHT ALL CATHOLICS
TOGETHER.
LUCKILY THE NEWS MEDIA WASTHERE TO HELP DRIVE US
APART.
>> WE HAVE TWO MEN WHO AREOFTEN SEEN AS SORT OF PARAGONS
ONE, JOHN XXIII ASSORT OF THE LIBERAL WING OF
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THEOTHER ONE POPE JOHN PAUL II
SEEN AS SORT OF THECONSERVATIVE.
>> TWO VERY DIFFERENT POPES.
ONE LIBERAL AND ONECONSERVATIVE.
>> ONE VIEWED AS A LIBERALICON AND ONE AS A
CONSERVATIVE ICON.
>> Stephen: THANK GOODNESSWITH ALL THE LOVE TALK THIS
WEEKEND I WAS AFRAID THAT WEWILL FORGET THAT EVERYTHING
IN THE WORLD MUST BE DIVIDEDINTO LIBERAL OR
CONSERVATIVE.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN WE ALL KNOW JUDAS
WAS A LIBERAL AND CLEARLYGOD'S A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE
HE'S PRETTY RELIGIOUS.
BUT DESPITE THE POPE'SINFALLIBILITY IN ALL THINGS
RELIGIOUS, I CAN'T HELP BUTFEELING YOU GOT SOMETHING
WRONG HERE.
>> TWO MIRACLES ARE REQUIREDFOR SAINTHOOD.
BUT POPE FRANCIS WAIVED THATREQUISITE FOR
POPE JOHN XXIII SEEN HERE ONTHE LEFT.
AND THE CANONIZATION PROCESSFOR POPE JOHN PAUL 2nd ON
THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE HEREBEGAN PRIOR TO THE NORMAL
FIVE YEAR WAITING PERIOD.
>> Stephen: THAT IS WRONG.
WE CANNOT LOWER OURSTANDARDS FOR CANONIZATION I
MEANS THAT'S HOW SAINT IDESGOT IN.
IF THERE ARE NO STANDARDS,EVERYTHING GOES TO HELL,
FIRST YOU DON'T NEED TWOMIRACLES TO BECOME A SAINT.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,EVERYONE AT THE VATICAN IS
WEARING DENIM ON CASUAL GOODFRIDAY.
