[CROWD CHANTING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
SIT DOWN EVERYBODY.
I TELL YOU, I TELL YOU FOLKS.
WHAT BARACK OBAMA WOULD GIVE FOR ENTHUSIASM LIKE THAT.
TONIGHT WE LAUNCH OUR COVERAGE OF THE 2012 PEOPLE'S PARTY CONGRESS OF CHARLOTTE.
THIS YEAR THEY ARE HOPING FOR A REPLAY OF FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN HOARDS OF HOPE-ADDLED LEMMINGS
CRIED AS THEIR DEAR LEADER ORATED BETWEEN SOARING GREEK COLUMNS.
FOUR YEARS AGO THOSE WERE FAKE GREEK COLUMNS.
THIS TIME IT'S THE ACTUAL PARTHENON.
[LAUGHTER]
GREECE SOLD IT FOR A BUCK 75 AND A JUG OF TZATZIKI.
FOLKS, DON'T BUY THE HYPE THE THIS CONVENTION IS THE BIGGEST DOG AND PONY SHOW SINCE LAST
YEAR WHEN I TRIED TO ENTER MY PALOMINO-DOODLE AT WESTMINSTER.
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY BANJO, THEY'RE BIGOTS.
ANYWAY, TONIGHT DNC DIS-INFO-TAINMENT LINE UP FEATURES RAHM EMANUEL, HARRY
REID, JIMMY CARTER, FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE JOAQUIN CASTRO AND HIS
TWIN BROTHER SAN ANTONIO MAYOR JULIAN CASTRO.
I MEAN CALL ME RACIST BUT I CANNOT TELL THESE HISPANICS APART.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS.
THE WHOLE THING IS JUST SAD,
IT'S JUST SAD.
EVERY TIME THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A CONVENTION IT'S LIKE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO HAVE ONE TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THIS TIME AROUND.
JUST ASK RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS.
>> TODAY THE THRILL AND PIXY DUST OF BARACK OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY IS GONE.
AMERICANS FEEL NO HOPE,
DEMOCRATS ARE DISPIRITED ENTHUSIASM IS CLEARLY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
>> Stephen:  YES.
[LAUGHTER]
YES.
WE HAVE ALL THE ENTHUSIASM.
[LAUGHTER]
MITT ROMNEY'S OUR CANDIDATE, AND THERE'
