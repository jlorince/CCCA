SNUP WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,
AMERICA!
OR SHOULD I SAY GHOUL TO HAVE
YOU WITH US ASCAREICA!
NATION, I LOVE... THANK YOU.
NATION, I LOVE HALLOWEEN.
EVERY YEAR I SIT ON MY PORCH
WITH A BIG BOWL OF CANDY AND A
RAKE AND I TELL THE KIDS IF THEY
WANT A TREAT THEY HAVE TO WORK
FOR IT.
NO FREE RIDES, A RAPUNZEL.
OH, AND CUT YOUR HAIR, HIPPY.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, EVERY YEAR I AM APPALLED
BY THE LATEST DEBASING COSTUMES
FOR WOMEN.
LIKE SEXY PIRATE, SEXY BUNNY OR
SEXY KETCHUP.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, IT'S OKAY TO SELL THIS BUT
WHEN I HOLD HER UPSIDE DOWN AND
WHACK HER ON THE BOTTOM I'M THE
ONE WHO GETS TASED!
COME ON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
COSTUME MAKERS, HOW DARE YOU
SINGLE OUT WOMEN FOR THIS KIND
OF OBJECTIFICATION.
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE GUYS WOULD
LOVE TO GET SLUTTY.
COME ON!
WHAT AM I HITTING THE GYM FOR IF
MY FRANKEN SOMETIME COSTUME ONLY
SHOWS OFF MY BOLTS AND NOT MY
NUTS.
I SAY IT'S HIGH TIME TO CLOSE
THIS OBJECTIFICATION GAP.
SO NEXT YEAR I WANT TO SEE
SKANKY HAZMAT WORKERS, KINKY
TAXIDERMISTS, RANDY CHEWBACCA...
(LAUGHTER)
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,
NAUGHTY PUNDIT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE GEORGE
WILL.
