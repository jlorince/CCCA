U.N. DOESN'T SEND IN
PEACEKEEPERS.
SO WHITHER NOW, EGYPT.
AT TIMES LIKE THESE, I ALWAYS GO
TO THE EXPERTS.
>> THERE WILL BE A NEW
LEADERSHIP IN EGYPT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
>> WE TONIGHT KNOW WHAT'S GOING
DO HAPPEN POLITICALLY.
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS
ALL GOING TO END UP.
>> WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT IS
COMING NEXT.
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO
END UP IN POWER.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS A PILE OF
JACK-SQUAT.
ANOTHER HOW DO WE KNOW?
HOW DO WE KNOW?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT,
FORTUNATELY, SCIENCE PROVIDE THE
ANSWER.
AFTER ALL, TODAY IS GROUNDHOG
DAY.
OUR ANNUAL CELEBRATION OF PAGAN
ANIMAL PROPHECY.
FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST GROUNDHOGS
MAKING PROF SEES.
IT'S OCTOPUSES PREDICTING SOCCER
GAMES.
AND THIS WEEK AN ORANG TAN
PICKED THE STEELERS TO WIN THE
SUPER BOWL, AND ANOTHER PICKED
THE PACKERS.
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S GOING TO BE A TIE.
OF COURSE, ON ONE LEVEL WE KNOW
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO WASTE PSYCHIC
ANIMALS ON SPORTS.
THEY SHOULD BE PREDICTING
REAL-WORLD EVENTS, AND WITH THAT
IN MIND PLEASE WELCOME THE

EGYPT IN THAT ARE YOU WORSHIPPED

SO, CHRISTIANE, TELL ME, IN YOUR
OPINION, IS THIS REVOLUTION AN
HONEST EXPRESSION OF THE
DEMOCRATIC DESIRE FOR SOCIAL
MOBILITY OR IS THIS A DANGEROUS
PLOT BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
TO CREATE A PAN-MEDITERRANEAN
CALIPHATE.
CALIPHATE?
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
I FORGOT, CATS DON'T TALK.
TO GET A CLEAR ANSWER ON EGYPT'S
FUTURE, I HAVE MARKED TWO BOWLS
HERE.
THIS BOWL IS MARKED "DEMOCRATIC
UPRISING."

POWER GRAB."

THOUGHTS.

LASER DOT.
