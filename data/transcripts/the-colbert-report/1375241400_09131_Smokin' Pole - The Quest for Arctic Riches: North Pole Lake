[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW, FOLKS, YOU
KNOW, FOLKS, WHAT YOU JUST DID
THERE...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
PLEASE, FOLKS.
I'VE GOT TELL YOU, WELCOME TO
THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THAT CHANTING OF MY NAME YOU
JUST DID, I DON'T CARE WHAT
ANYBODY SAYS, THAT'S THE SONG OF
THE SUMMER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NATION, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS
SHOW YOU KNOW I ALWAYS BRING YOU
THE HOTTEST DEVELOPMENTS FROM
AROUND THE WORLD.
AND THANKS TO GLOBAL WARMING, IT
DON'T GET NO HOTTER THAN THE
ARCTIC BECAUSE THE NORTH POLE,
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE TOP OF
OUR PLANET'S ICE-TOUPEE, IS NOW
A LAKE.
WHICH MEANS THE ACTUAL POLE
ITSELF HAS GONE FROM "CHARMING
LANDMARK" TO "THING TO CLIMB FOR
SURVIVAL."
WHICH OF COURSE BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT OF SMOKIN'
POLE: THE QUEST FOR ARCTIC
RICHES.
FOLKS, AFTER A MONTH OF
TEMPERATURES TWO TO FIVE DEGREES
HIGHER THAN AVERAGE, THE NORTH
POLE HAS GONE FROM THIS TO THIS.
NOW, NO SURPRISE THE ICE MELTED.
THE NORTH POLE IS AT THE TOP OF
THE EARTH SO IT'S CLOSER TO THE
SUN.
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.
THIS, OF COURSE, IS BAD NEWS FOR
SUPERMAN WHO IS FINALLY OUT OF
EXCUSES FOR WHY HE'S NEVER HAD
AQUAMAN OVER.
"YOU WOULD HATE IT.
IT'S FROZEN."
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, NOW WE
KNOW WHY SANTA'S BEEN GIVING US
ALL THAT COAL IN OUR STOCKINGS.
HE WANTED BEACH-FRONT PROPERTY.
AND ANYONE WHO IS IS ALARMED BY
THIS NEW ARCTIC LAKE, YOU SHOULD
JUST RELAX.
IT'S JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT
THAT HAS OCCURREDDED EVERY
SUMMER SINCE 2003.
NO REASON TO PANIC.
THE TIME FOR PANICKING WAS 2003.
WAY TOO LATE NOW.
BESIDES, THIS IS NOTHING NEW IN
EARTH'S HISTORY BECAUSE WARM
CLIMATES EXTENDED INTO THE
ARCTIC AS RECENTLY AS THE EOCENE
EPOCH, 56 TO 4 MILLION YEARS
AGO.
AND PEOPLE GOT ALONG FINE BACK
THEN.
TECHNICALLY THERE WERE NO PEOPLE
BUT EVERYTHING WAS PEACHY KEEN
FOR PALEOCHIROPTERYX, THE FIRST
RECOGNIZABLE BAT.
SO AS OUR CLIMATE SHIFTS BACK
INTO THAT OF THE EOCENE AND ALL
THOSE EXTINCT ANIMALS RETURN TO
THE ARCTIC, WE HUMANS WILL JUST
HAVE TO HAVE ADAPT.
LET'S SING IT FOR SANTA, KIDS.
RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED RED HORPED
BRONTOTHERIUM HAD A PROM NET
NASAL RIDGE AND IF YOU EVER SAW
IT, YOU WOULD SAY, DEARED GOD,
I'M BEING CHASED BY THE
BRONTOTHERIUM NATURAL PREDATOR
ANDREW-SARCUS, A 13-FOOT
CARNIVOROUS DOG.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SO, FOLKS, I SAY LET'S ENJOY
THIS MELTING ICE CAP AND MAYBE
TURN A BUCK ON IT.
AFTER ALL, THAT MELTED NORTH
POLE LAKE SURE LOOKS REFRESHING.
LET'S SEND SOME TANKER TRUCKS UP
THERE, SUCK IT UP AND BOTTLE IT.
WE CAN CALL IT "POLE AND SPRINGS
."
AND THANKS TO ALL
