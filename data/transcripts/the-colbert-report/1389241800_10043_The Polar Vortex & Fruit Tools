BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE'SGOING TO HAMMER THE BANANA
MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALONEBECAUSE MY COLLEGE ROOMMATE
WALKED IN ON ME ONCE AND ITWAS VERY EMBARRASSING.
FOLKS, LIKE FRIDAYING AN EGGON THE SIDEWALK IN SUMMER,
HAMMERING WITH A BANANA ISBUT ONE OF THE MANY
FOOD-BASED TECHNIQUES THATREPORTERS HAVE AT THE READY
TO DEMONSTRATE WEATHERCONDITIONS TO THOSE OF US
WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OFDOORS.
(LAUGHTER)NOW NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW
THIS BUT BACK WHEN IANCHORED THE CHANNEL 7 NEWS
AT NOON AT WPPS PATERSONSPRINGS NORTH CAROLINA I WAS
ALSO THE SECOND ALTERNATEWEEKEND GO UNDERSTUDY AND I
STILL HAVE MY METEOR LOGICALDEMONSTRATION FRUIT KIT,
OKAY SO IF THERE ARE NICHOLDWEATHER REPORTERS OUT THERE
LOOKING TO LEARN FROM AMASTER, PAY ATTENTION.
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.
IF YOU WANT TO SHOW THEAUDIENCE THAT IT IS BRISK,
BUT STILL ABOVE FREEZING,USE A NAVAL ORANGE TO
ASSEMBLE A SWING SET.
ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU NEED TOSHOW THAT IT'S IN THE 50s
WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN,CHANGE A CAR TIRE WITH A
BARTLETT PEAR, OKAY.
BUT IF IT'S OVER 60 DEGREESAND CLOUDY THERE IS NO WAY
TO SAY THAT EXCEPT BYBEATING A RACCOON TO DEATH
WITH A PINEAPPLE.
ALL RIGHT?
LIKE THAT.
DOW LIKE THAT?
A LITTLE ROUGH STUFF.
LITTLE ROUGH STUFF.
ANY TEMPERATURE HIGHER THANTHAT, FRUIT WON'T WORK.
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USEDELI MEATS, ALL RIGHT.
AND AUDIENCE CAN ONLYUNDERSTAND THAT IT'S 95
DEGREES IF YOU BUFF OUT ASCRATCHED QUARTER PANEL WITH
A HONEY BAKED HAM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
