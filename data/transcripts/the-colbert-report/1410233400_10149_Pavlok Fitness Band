(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
THANKS SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: NATION, I BELIEVE
THAT MY BODY IS A TEMPLE.
WHICH IS WHY I'VE APPLIED FOR ATAX EXEMPTION..
SO I'M ALWAYS KEEPING UP WITHTHE LATEST IN WEARABLE
SPORT-TECH.
IF I FORGET TO HIT THE GYM, MYFITBIT JUST SYNCHS TO MY PEBBLE,
WHICH SENDS A REMINDER TO MYIPHONE, WHICH I DELETE WITH
GOOGLE GLASS.
(LAUGHTER)GOODBYE.
REPEATED NAGGING MESSAGES DON'TMOTIVATE ME.
IF THEY DID, I'D HAVE ALINKED-IN ACCOUNT.
(LAUGHTER)STOP IT!
I DO NOT WANT TO CONNECT WITHDAVE!
I HAD COFFEE WITH HIM ONCE!
BUT FINALLY, THERE'S ASMART-TECH DEVICE.
THAT CAN JOLT AMERICANS INTOACTION.
>> MEET THE NEWEST FITNESSCRAZE.
THIS IS THE PAVLOCK.
THAT BRACELET CLAIMS TO ZAPUSERS IF THEY STOP EXERCISING.
IF YOU DON'T GET MOVING, IT'SGOING TO SHOCK YOU.
YEAH, IT SENDS 400 VOLTS,ELECTRICAL JOLTS RIGHT INTO THE
ARM.
>> STEPHEN: YES, IF YOU DO NOTEXERCISE, YOU GET AN ELECTRIC
SHOCK.
AND, FOR ONCE, IT'S NOT FROM THEEMTS
OF COURSE, THE PAVLOK IS NAMEDFOR RUSSIAN BEHAVIORAL PIONEER
IVAN PAVLOV, WHO CONDITIONEDDOGS TO SALIVATE EVERY TIME HE
RANG A BELL, HENCE THEEXPRESSION, "EVERY TIME A BELL
RINGS, AN ANGEL GETS HIS.
WINGS COVERED IN DOG SALIVA."
(LAUGHTER)AND BY USING PSYCHOLOGICALLY
PROVEN AND USER TESTEDALGORITHMS, THE PAVLOK WRISTBAND
ENFORCES USERS' COMMITMENTS TOFITNESS, PRODUCTIVITY AND MORE.
YES, THE SAME PROVENPRODUCTIVITY ALGORITHMS THAT USE
ELECTRICITY TO ENFORCE CATTLETOWARD THE "GYM."
(LAUGHTER)YEAH, THOSE COWS COULD REALLY
PULL A MUSCLE IN THERE.
(LAUGHTER)REMEMBER TO STRETCH OUT, BESSIE!
(LAUGHTER)AND IF ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY
DOESN'T MOVE YOUR FAT ASS,THE SYNCHRONIZED PAVLOK APP WILL
ALSO ZAP YOU WHERE IT 'REALLY'HURTS BECAUSE --
IF THE USER HASN'T COMPLETEDTHEIR GOAL,
THEY GET CHARGED MONEY THROUGHTHE APP AND POSTS ON YOUR
FACEBOOK WALL "I DIDN'T MAKE ITTO THE GYM TODAY."
(LAUGHTER)AND THAT'S JUST THE MOTIVATION
YOU NEED WHEN YOU'RE IN A DARKPLACE, OUT OF SHAPE, AT HOME,
TOO TIRED TO WORK OUT, IT'SPROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
GETTING ENOUGH PUBLICHUMILIATION.
(LAUGHTER)WHILE PAVLOK'S A GOOD START, I
BELIEVE THE PAIN AND SHAME OFSURRENDERING YOUR WILL TO AN
ELECTRONIC DEVICE CAN GO MUCHFURTHER.
WHICH IS WHY I'M THRILLED TO BEPART OF A NEW WEARABLE FITNESS
PILOT PROGRAM I HEARD ABOUTTHROUGH MY FINANCIAL ADVISOR,
GORLOCK.
IT'S CALLED "THE SPINE SPIDER."
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS -- PLACE ITANYWHERE ON OR NEAR YOUR BODY
AND IT WILL CRAWL TO AND EMBEDITS NEUROPINCERS IN YOUR SPINAL
COLUMN.
NO RECHARGING NECESSARY.
IT FEEDS ON YOUR BLOOD!
AND WHAT A WORKOUT.
THE SPINE-SPIDER TAKES OVER YOURMOTOR FACULTIES, AND MARCHES YOU
INTO A FIELD WHERE YOU --BUILD A LARGE CRYSTAL PYRAMID.
WHAT'S THE PYRAMID FOR?
WHY DOES GORLOCK NEED IT?
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN IT'SFINISHED?
WITH SPINE SPIDER, YOUR BRAIN ISPREVENTED FROM THINKING THOSE
QUESTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)AND, FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN USING
THE THE SPINE SPIDER FORWEEKS AND LIFTING MYSTERIOUS
PRISMS AT THE BEHEST OF ANUNKNOWN ALIEN OVERLORD
HAS DONE WONDERS FOR MY CORE.
BUT DON'T LOOK FOR SPINE SPIDERAT YOUR NEAREST ELECTRONICS
STORE -- SPINE SPIDER WILL FINDYOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
