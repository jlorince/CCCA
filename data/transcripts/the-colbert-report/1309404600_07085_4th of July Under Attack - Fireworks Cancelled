[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANNELING STEPHEN] --]
CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW YOU ARE EXCITED.
THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING UP.
FOLKS, MONDAY IS JULY
FOURTH, NAMED FOR OUR FOUR
FATHERS: GEORGE.
BENJAMIN,
THOMAS,
AND RINGO.
[LAUGHTER]
I ALWAYS CHECK MY CALENDAR TO
FIND OUT WHAT DAY IT FALLS ON,
AND THIS YEAR, IT'S ON JULY 4TH.
WOW, FEELS LIKE IT'S GETTING
EARLIER AND EARLIER EVERY YEAR.
THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT
TRADITIONS.
OF COURSE, EVERY YEAR, I TAKE
THE KIDS OUT AND WE CUT DOWN AN
AMERICAN FLAGPOLE.
TAKE IT HOME, PUT IT UP, AND
DECORATE IT WITH FLAGS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT EVERYONE LOVES AMERICA LIKE
I DO.
I'M SAD TO SAY.
SO UNFORTUNATELY IT'S TIME ONCE
AGAIN FOR 4TH OF JULY UNDER
ATTACK!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LITTLE KNOWN FACTOID: THEY'RE
CALLED ROMAN CANDLES BECAUSE
JESUS STOLE THEM FROM PONTIUS
PILATE.
[LAUGHTER]
NO SURPRISE, OUR PATRIOTIC
TRADITIONS ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM
THE USUAL LEFTY PINKO NANNY
STATE:  TEXAS.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR MORE WE GO TO KTRK,
HOUSTON'S NEWS LEADER.
>> TOMBALL IS THE LATEST ON A
GROWING LIST OF CITIES AND
ORGANIZATIONS CANCELING FOURTH
OF JULY FIREWORKS SHOWS BECAUSE
OF FEAR OF STARTING A FIRE.
>> WITH THE DROUGHT CONDITION
AND THE WEATHER WHAT IT IS RIGHT
NOW, IT'S JUST DANGEROUS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT:
THEY'RE CANCELING FIRE'WORKS
BECAUSE IT MIGHT LEAD TO FIRE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S LIKE CANCELING A CARNIVAL
BECAUSE IT MIGHT LEAD TO BEING
ABDUCTED BY CARNIES.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S PART OF THE THRILL.
AND IT'S NOT JUST PUBLIC
FIREWORK SHOWS THAT ARE BEING
CANCELED.
150 TEXAS COUNTIES HAVE
BANNED FIREWORKS ALTOGETHER, AND
ANYONE CAUGHT BUYING OR SELLING
THEM WILL FACE A $500 FINE.
HOW DARE YOU, TEXAS?
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,
BUT I'M THINKING I'M ABOUT TO
MESS WITH YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS AN ATTACK ON THE KIND OF
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAKE THIS
COUNTRY GREAT:
SHABBY CASH-ONLY ROADSIDE SHACKS
THAT SELL CHINESE EXPLOSIVES TO
DRUNK PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT WILL THIS DO TO OUR
NATION'S PROSTHETIC HAND
INDUSTRIES?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW THEY'LL BE COMPLETELY
DEPENDENT ON WEEDWHACKER
ACCIDENTS AND PEOPLE FISHING
SHRIMP FORKS OUT OF THE GARBAGE
DISPOSAL.
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS, THEY'RE ROBBING OUR KIDS
OF CLASSIC CHILDHOOD
EXPERIENCES.
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN SOUTH
CAROLINA, I HAD SO MUCH FUN
BLOWING UP MAILBOXES, STRAPPING
GRASSHOPPERS TO BOTTLE ROCKETS
TO SIMULATE THE APOLLO MISSION,
[LAUGHTER]
AND PLAYING GAMES OF "GUESS THE
FUSE LENGTH."
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT'S THE FOURTH WITHOUT
ALL THE GREAT FIREWORKS, LIKE
THE PUNISHER,
THE DE-THUMBINATOR
AND THE EARDRUM SODOMIZER?
WELL, FEAR NOT FIREWORK-LOVING
TEXANS.
THIS BAN DOESN'T SPELL THE END
OF YOUR FOURTH OF JULY
CELEBRATION.
THERE'S ONE FIREWORK THAT WILL
NEVER BE TOO DANGEROUS FOR
TEXAS.
THIS KIND.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS YOU CAN PICK ONE OF THESE
UP ANYWHERE IN TEXAS:  WALMART,
VENDING MACHINES, THAT ARCADE
CLAW GAME.
[LAUGHTER]
SO FOLLOW MY LEAD, TEXAS.
AND IF ANYONE OBJECTS, YOU TELL
THEM, "YOU CAN HAVE MY FIREWORKS
WHEN YOU PRY THEM FROM MY COLD,
HANDLESS HANDS."
[LAUGHTER]
