>> Stephen: YOU CALLEDWATERGATE A COUP D'E TAT BY
NIXON'S ENEMIES.
>> YES.
HOW WAS THIS NOT JUSTAN EXERCISE IN JUSTICE.
>> BILL CLINTON WAS IMPEACHEDAND SURVIVED THE SENATE BECAUSE
HE HAD MACHINERY IN CONGRESSTHAT SUPPORTED THE UNITED STATES
AND THE MEDIA WERE WITH HIM.
WHEN NIXON CAME TO WASHINGTON,BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS WERE
AGAINST HIM, THE MEDIA LOATHEDHIM FROM THE ALGER HISS CASE, HE
HAD A CORRUPT F.B.I. OFFICIALLEAKING THE MATERIAL.
SO ALL THIS MACHINERY, THAT WASPUT TO WORK AND THERE WAS NO
DOUBT NIXON DID WRONG, MADE AMISTAKE AND DID FOOLISH THINGS,
BUT THEY DIDN'T DESTROY HIM OUTOF LOVE OF, I THINK, THE
CONSTITUTION.
THEY SAW A CHANCE TO GET RID OFTHE GREATEST ENEMY THEY'D HAD
SINCE WORLD WAR II.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINKVIETNAM HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH
IT, HIS ESCALATING THE WAR INVIETNAM WAS SO UNPOPULAR.
>> YOU CAN'T SAY NIXON ESCALATEDTHE WAR!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
>> Stephen: LET ME SAY THESECRET BOMBINGS OF CAMBODIA.
SENDING THE WAR TO A DIFFERENTCOUNTRY, ALL RIGHT?
>> LET'S TALK FACTS.
>> Stephen: DID HE BOMBCAMBODIA SECRETLY?
>> YES, HE -->> Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR
APOLOGY.>> NO APOLOGY NEEDED
>> Stephen:  MAYBE THECAMBODIANS NEED AN APOLOGY.
>> YOU'RE FILIBUSTERING.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYINGRIGHT NOW, PAT BUCHANAN, YOU'RE
FOR ELIMINATING THE TALK SHOWHOST FILL BUSTER?
(LAUGHTER)IN WHICH CASE YOU BETTER GET OFF
THE McCLOUGHLIN GROUP BECAUSETHAT GUY WON'T SHUT UP.
>> WHEN NIXON TOOK OFFICE THEREWERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN VIETNAM,PUT THERE BY JFK AND JOHNSON
BY THE END OF HIS FIRST TERM,EVERYONE WAS HOME.
TO DO IT HE HAD TO BOMB THECOMMUNIST SANCTUARIES IN
CAMBODIA AND HE DID THE RIGHTAND MORAL THING AND SAVED
AMERICAN LIVES BY SO DOING.
IT WAS NOT NIXON'S WAR, IT WASLIBERALISM'S WAR AND HE ENDED
IT AND THE ONLY REASON CAMBODIAFELL TO THE COMMUNISTS ISBECAUSE
RICHARD NIXON WAS BROKEN BY HISENEMIES AND COULDN'T STOP WHAT
WAS COMING.
