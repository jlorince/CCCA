BY THE WAY, I AM AVAILABLE FOR
CHILDREN'S PARTIES.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, FISCAL CONSERVATIVES
LIKE ME INSIST ON A BALANCED
BUDGET AMENDMENT IS BECAUSE
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE.
MITCH MCCONNELL TALKS.
>> THE CONSTITUTION MUST BE
AMENDED TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT
IN CHECK.
WE'VE TRIED PERSUASION.
WE'VE TRIED NEGOTIATIONS.
WE'VE TRIED ELECTIONS.
NOTHING HAS WORKED.
>> Stephen: YES!
WHEN IT COMES TO BALANCING
BUDGETS, DEMOCRACY JUST NOT UP
TO THE JOB.
IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO DEFEAT
HITLER AND THE RUSSIANS, BUT
IT'S NOT GOOD AT MATH.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE IN A DEMOCRACY ELECTED
LEADERS NEED TO GET REELECTED.
AND IF THEY MAKE DECISIONS
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE, THEY
SOMETIMES LOSE.
FORTUNATELY, THIS DEBT CEILING
DEAL HAS A WAY TO FIX THAT.
AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
WORD:
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WITH GREAT POWER COMES NO
RESPONSIBILITY.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, WE WILL NEVER BALANCE THE
BUDGET WITHOUT REINING IN SOCIAL
SECURITY AND MEDICARE -- BUT
THAT'S HARD BECAUSE GRANDMA
VOTES.
[LAUGHTER]
AND SHE REFUSES TO TAKE PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR GETTING OLD.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THIS DEBT CEILING
COMPROMISE PROPOSES A NEW
LEGISLATIVE BODY.
>> NOW COMES A PLAN TO PUT POWER
IN THE HANDS OF A "SUPER
CONGRESS."
>> THE SO-CALLED "SUPER
CONGRESS."
>> THIS "SUPER CONGRESS."
>> "SUPER CONGRESS."
>> ARE YOU READY FOR THIS --
"SUPER CONGRESS"?
>> Stephen: YES, I'M READY FOR
THE "SUPER CONGRESS"!
[LAUGHTER]
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF ENCASING
HARRY REID'S SKELETON IN
ADAMANTIUM, OR MAKING MITCH
MCCONNELL INTO A NINJA TURTLE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT TURNS OUT, THIS "SUPER
CONGRESS" IS EVEN COOLER.
>> IT CONSISTS OF 12 LAWMAKERS,
EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO
PARTIES, THE REST OF CONGRESS
WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO AMEND OR
FILIBUSTER ITS RECOMMENDATIONS.
>> Stephen: YES, ONLY TWELVE
LAWMAKERS.
THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE THE REAL
PROBLEM WITH CONGRESS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN TOO MANY REASONABLE PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT EVEN BETTER, ONLY TWELVE
PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE THESE
UNPOPULAR RECOMMENDATIONS.
THAT WAY, WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY
AND MEDICARE GET CUT, THE NON
"SUPER CONGRESS" CAN SAY, "HEY,
I DIDN'T PUSH GRANDMA IN FRONT
OF THAT TRAIN, I JUST VOTED IN
FAVOR OF THOSE TWELVE GUYS DOING
IT."
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, EVEN THAT MIGHT MAKE
INCUMBENTS POLITICALLY
VULNERABLE, SO INSTEAD OF VOTING
ON SUPERCONGRESSIONAL
LEGISLATION, CONGRESS SHOULD
JUST VOTE UP OR DOWN ON REAM OF
BLANK PAPER.
[LAUGHTER]
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WAS PASSED
UNTIL THE EFFECTS START SHOWING
UP.
SAY, GRANDMA STARTS EATING DOG
FOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
SURE, SHE'S ANGRY, BUT SHE CAN'T
TAKE IT OUT ON HER CONGRESSMAN
COME ELECTION TIME.
UNLESS HE OR SHE IS ONE OF THE
12 MEMBERS OF THE "SUPER
CONGRESS."
THOSE GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE A
PROBLEM.
[LAUGHTER]
SO THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID VOTER
REPRISALS IS TO MAKE THE "SUPER
CONGRESS" ANONYMOUS.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, THE SUPER-CONGRESSMEN
THEMSELVES SHOULDN'T KNOW IF
THEY'RE IN THE "SUPER CONGRESS."
EVERYONE GETS TO VOTE, BUT ONLY
TWELVE OF THEM COUNT.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'LL LIKE A FIRING SQUAD WHERE
ONE GUY HAS A BLANK, SO THEY CAN
ALL TELL THEMSELVES THAT THEY
DIDN'T EXECUTE THE PRISONER.
ONLY IN THIS CASE, THEY'RE
AIMING AT A GRANDMA WHO'S BEEN
CONVICTED OF COSTING US MONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE.
PROBLEM SOLVED.
BECAUSE ONLY WHEN CONGRESS HAS
NO ACCOUNTABILITY CAN THEY LEAD
THIS COUNTRY BACK TO PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
