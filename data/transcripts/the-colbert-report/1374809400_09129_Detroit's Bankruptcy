>> BOOYAKASHA.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE OUTLIVED
THEIR USEFULNESS-- DETROIT.
>> NOW DETROIT HAS FALLEN ON
SUCH HARD TIMES THE CITY IS
FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY, BECOMING
THE LARGEST U.S. CITY TO DO SO
>> MOVE IS UNPRECEDENTED.
THE BIGGEST MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
A MAJOR U.S. CITY OFFICIALLY
DECLARING IT CANNOT PAY ITS DEBT
ESTIMATED AT $18 BILLION.
>> Stephen: $18 BILLION!
AND DETROIT BORROWED THOSE
BILLIONS FROM SOME PRETTY
SERIOUS PEOPLE.
IF THEY DON'T GET PAID, THEY'VE
THRENTED TO CUT OFF MICHIGAN'S
THUMB.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, IT TURNS OUT, ROBO COP WAS
AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF DETROIT'S
FUTURE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS TELL
THE STORY.
THE CITY'S POPULATION HAS
DWIBDLE TWD 2 MILLION TO
700,000.
DETROIT HAS THE HIGHEST
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE NATION,
AND AT 73,000 ABANDONED
BUILDINGS.
KNOWING HOW FAR THE CITY HAS
FALLEN WOULD HAVE HENRY FORD
ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE AND
SOMEHOW BLAMING THE JEWS FOR IT.
NOTICE, THERE ARE A LOT OF
THEORIES OUT THERE, ABOUT WHAT
CAUSED DETROIT'S DECLINE--
MANUFACTURING JOBS GOING
OVERSEAS.
CORRUPT POLITICIANS.
BUT THE EASIEST EXPLANATION FOR
DETROIT'S DECLINE IS IT'S ALL
THE UNIONS' FAULT.
>> YOU HAVE ALL THESE PENSIONS
AND YOU HAVE ALL THIS DEBT, AND
NOW IT'S JUST TAKING THEM DOWN.
>> THERE WAS OVER-GENEROUS
PENSIONS AND BENEFITS.
>> LAVISH PENSIONS.
>> LAVISH PENSIONS.
>> Stephen: YES, LAVISH
PENSIONS, ON AVERAGE $19,000 A
YEAR, WHICH DETROIT NOW SAYS
THEY WILL PAY 10 CENTS ON THE
DOLLAR.
BUT RETIREES, IF YOU BUDGET
RIGHT, YOU CAN AFFORD EVERYTHING
YOU NEED IN DETROIT-- FOOD,
RENT, A CUE BALL AND A SOCK TO
FIGHT OFF HUNGRY RACCOONS.
LUCKILY, LUCKILY, THERE IS A
GREAT IDEA OUT THERE ON HOW TO
PAY DETROIT'S CREDITORS.
>> THE TREASURERS OF THE DETROIT
INSTITUTES OF ART COULD BE IN
DANGER.
>> KEVYN ORR HAS WARNED THE
D.I.A. IT'S HUGE COLLECTION
COULD END UP ON THE AUCTION
BLOCK.
>> THEY HAVE VAN GOGH, MATISSE,
AND DIEGO RIVERA, WHICH IS
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS
COMMISSIONED BY FORD HIMSELF.
>> THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PAWN
DETROIT'S MURALS DEPICTING A
SOCIALIST WORKERS' PARADISE.
IN FACT, THEY HAVE RECEIVED A
GENEROUS OFFER FROM THE MUSEUM
OF IRONY.
IRONY.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART
ALSO OWNS A COPY OF RODIN'S "THE
THINKER" AND I MIGHT PUT IN A
