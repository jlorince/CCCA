(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
NATION, WHEN IT COMES TODEFENDING AMERICA, THERE IS
NOBODY I TRUST MORE THAN TEXASCONGRESSMAN AND CONFUSED PIECE
OF GNOCCHI, LOUIE GOHMERT.
BECAUSE HE'S BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAYTHE THINGS THAT NO ONE HAS THE
SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO SAY.
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT BARACKHUSSEIN OBAMA.
HE HAS HELPED JUMP START A NEWOTTOMAN EMPIRE.
WE ARE GOING TO BORROW MOREMONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO
POSSIBLY GIVE THEM MONEY BACK TOCREATE HABITATS FOR WILD DOGS
AND CATS THAT ARE RARE.
THERE'S NO ASSURANCE THAT IF WEDID THAT, WE WOULDN'T END UP
WITH MOO GOO DOG PAN OR MOO GOOCAT PAN.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: THIS GOOD MAN IS
ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT FOODSAFETY, EVER SINCE HE DRANK THAT
PAINT THINNER.
IT'S ONLY TWO LETTERS AWAY FROMPAINT DINNER.
AND RECENTLY, LOUIE MADE WORDSWITH HIS MOUTH AGAIN.
THIS TIME, TO EXPLAIN ONCE ANDFOR ALL THE DANGERS OF GAYS IN
THE MILITARY.
>> I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, HEY, YOUKNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
GAYS IN THE MILITARY.
LOOK AT THE GREEKS.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY DID HAVEPEOPLE COME ALONG WHO THEY LOVED
THAT WAS THE SAME SEX AND WOULDGIVE THEM MASSAGES BEFORE THEY
WENT INTO BATTLE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S ADIFFERENT KIND OF FIGHTING.
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR.
AND IF YOU'RE SITTING AROUNDGETTING MASSAGES ALL DAY, READY
TO GO INTO A BIG, PLANNEDBATTLE, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
LAST VERY LONG.
IT'S GUERILLA FIGHTING.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ULTIMATELYVULNERABLE TO TERRORISM AND, IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU START DOING INTHE MILITARY LIKE THE GREEKS
DID...
AS PEOPLE HAVE SAID, LOUIE, YOUHAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND, YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR HISTORY.
OH, YES, I DO.
I KNOW EXACTLY.
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YES, GOHMERT
KNOWS HIS HISTORY.
OR HE MAY HAVE JUST BEENWATCHING THE GAY VERSION OF THE
FILM 300.
(LAUGHTER)BY WHICH I MEAN THE ONE RELEASED
IN THEATERS.
(LAUGHTER)>>
AND THE GREEKS WERE THE GAYESTARMY IN HISTORY.
IT'S WHY THEY WERE ALWAYSTRAIPSING OFF FOR FABULOUS
MEDITERRANEAN WARS.
AND WHY THEY FOUGHT PACKEDTOGETHER IN A PHALANX, AKA THE
MAN-ON-MAN MASSAGE CUBE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT LIKE GOHMERT  SAID, THAT WAS
FINE FOR ANCIENT GREECE, BACKWHEN BATTLES HAD A SET TIME AND
DATE.
IT WAS EASY -- YOU'D GET ARUB-DOWN, THEN RUN OUT TO A
PELOPONNESIAN FIELD FOR YOUR2:00 P.M. FACE-SPEARING.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK IN TODAY'S
AMERICA'S MILITARY.
GAY MASSAGES HAVE NO PLACE INOUR NEVER-ENDING GUERILLA WAR.
I.S.I.S. ISN'T GONNA POSTPONEITS AMBUSH SO YOU CAN FINISH
LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITEPERUVIAN PAN FLUTE CD.
(LAUGHTER)AND WE ARE IN GRAVE DANGER,
BECAUSE THE HOMOSEXUALSEAWEED-WRAP LIFESTYLE HAS
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE MILITARY.
LOOK AT THE AIR FORCE.
WHY DO YOU EVEN NEED A BACKSEAT IN A FIGHTER JET?
THE CO-PILOT'S JUST BACK THEREFOR THE NECK RUBS!
(LAUGHTER)NO WONDER TOM CRUISE WAS SO
TENSE AFTER GOOSE DIED.
AND WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALLEDHIM GOOSE?
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
WE MISS YOU ANTHONY EDWARDS!
SO I STAND WITH LOUIE WHEN HESAID THIS --
>> AS PEOPLE SAID, LOUIE, YOUDON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOUR HISTORY.
I SAID, OH, YES, I DO.
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
>> Stephen: I'M WITH YOU, SIR.
PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME, STEPHEN,YOU HAVE GOTTA UNDERSTAND, YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR HISTORY.
YOU'RE DUMB, DENSE, A MENTALMIDGET WITH THE I.Q. OF A BUTTER
DISH WHOSE MIND IS A BLACK HOLETHAT SUCKS ALL SURROUNDING
THOUGHT INTO AN INFINITESINGULARITY OF PURE STUPIDITY.
I'M SURPRISED YOU CAN EVEN DRESSYOURSELF.
I BET YOU HAVE TO RUB PEANUTBUTTER INSIDE YOUR LIPS TO
REMEMBER TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH ANDBREATHE.
I'VE NEVER MET, AND HOPE TONEVER MEET AGAIN, A MAN SO
PERVASIVELY, ASTOUNDINGLY,UNYIELDINGLY IGNORANT.
TO WHICH I SAY, WELL, YOUHAVEN'T MET LOUIE GOHMERT.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
