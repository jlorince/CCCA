THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN TO
HOST A REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
HE'S ABSOLUTELY THE PERFECT
PERSON TO DO IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD
FOR IT.
ASK DRUM.
>> THIS IS A NEWS MAX DEBATE.
NEWS MAX IS A POWERFUL
ORGANIZATION, GOOD ORGANIZATION,
AND THEY ASKED ME TO DO IT.
I SAID I WOULD DO IT.
THE CANDIDATES HAVE COME UP TO
TRUMP TOWER.
I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THEM.
EVERYONE WANTS MY ENDORSEMENT.
I REPRESENT MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE WEB SITES.
BUT I REMEMBER JUST MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE.
AND THAT'S JUST HIS MAKE-UP
TEAM.
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY JON HUNTSMAN,
RON PAUL AND MITT ROMNEY HAVE
ALL SAID THEY WOULD NOT APPEAR
AT HIS T DEBATE, SO TRUMP'S
DEBATE IS GOING DOWN HIS
GOLD-PLATED CRAPPER.
SO TO FILL THE ENORMOUS VOID,
LAST NIGHT I ANNOUNCED THAT I
WOULD BE HOSTING STEPHEN
COLBERT'S SOUTH CAROLINA SERIOUS
CLASSY REPUBLICAN DEBATE.

SOME TIME IN JANUARY.
OKAY.
LET'S GET THAT STONE.
OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE ON ANIMAL
PLANET.
THEY HAVEN'T RETURNED MY CALLS
YET, BUT THEY'RE BUSY.

CHAMPAGNE ROOM PUTTING THEM ON

HE CALLED ME LAST NIGHTMENT HE
CRIED.
WE TALKED.
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN ABOUT IT.
I GOT ALL THE RESPECT IN THE
WORLD FOR THIS GUY.
OKAY.
THAT SAID, HE'S A PUNCH LINE.
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S A PILE OF JOKE DUST COUGHED
UP BY CARROT TOP, CLASSIEST
VEGETABLE TOP PROP COMIC IN THE
HISTORY OF VEGAS.

SURROUNDED BY ELEGANCE UP ON THE
