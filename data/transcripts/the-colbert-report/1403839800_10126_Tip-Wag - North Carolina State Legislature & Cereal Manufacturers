[LAUGHTER]FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,
YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWNPOINT OF VIEW.
MINE JUST HAPPENS TO LOOK OVERTHE GORGEOUS LANDSCAPE OF ME
BEING RIGHT.
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]FIRST UP, FOLKS, IT'S NEVER TOO
EARLY TO START MAKING YOUR PLANSFOR NEW YEAR'S EVE.
THAT'S WHY I RUN DRILLS TO STAYSHARP, EVERY NIGHT AT THE STROKE
OF 12, I CHUG A BOTTLE OFCHAMPAGNE AND THEN WEEP WHEN NO
ONE KISSES ME.
THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO CLAYCOUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA'S ANNUAL
POSSUM DROP.
FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH RICHSOUTHERN HERITAGE, HERE'S WHAT
POSSUM DROP MEANS.
>> THEY ACTUALLY TAKE A LIVEPOSSUM.
THEY PUT IT IN A BOX.
AND THEN THEY DROP IT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen:  SORRY IF THAT GOT A
BIT TECHNICAL, BUT YOU GET THEIDEA.
WELL NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, THEFASCIST FUR-SCISTS AT PETA
THINK THIS EVENT IS CRUEL TOPOSSUM-KIND.
I ASSUME BECAUSE IT KEEPS THEMFROM THEIR NATURAL POSSUM
DESTINY OF BEING CRUSHED UNDERTHE TIRE OF A KIA.
WAY BACK IN 2012, A JUDGE INNORTH CAROLINA RULED IT WAS
ILLEGAL TO USE A LIVE OPOSSUMFOR SUCH AN EVENT.
O-DICULOUS.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE PCPOLICE WILL MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO
HAVE THE LIVE POSSUM NATIVITYSCENE.
LOSING THE POSSUM DROP WAS ABLOW TO AN ANCIENT TRADITION
DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1990.
THAT'S RIGHT, SINCE THE TIME OFTHE DINOSAURS, WHICH IS WHY I'M
GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO THENORTH CAROLINA STATE LEGISLATURE
FOR SAVING THE CELEBRATION WITHA NEW BILL EXCLUDING OPOSSUMS
FROM STATE WILDLIFE LAWS BETWEENDECEMBER 26TH AND JANUARY 2nd
IN CLAY COUNTY WHERE THE ANNUALPOSSUM DROP CELEBRATION IS HELD.
SO NOW...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]SO TONIGHT WE'VE GOT SOME HUGE
FANS OF PEOPLE WHO ENJOYWATCHING RODENTS AFFECTED BY
GRAVITY.
SO TO RECAP, TO RECAP, FOR ONEWEEK, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU
WANT WITH A LIVE POSSUM IN ACAGE.
YOU CAN RAISE IT, YOU CAN LOWERIT, YOU CAN MOVE IT SIDEWAYS.
THE ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AREENDLESS.
DON'T WORRY.
POSSUM-KILLING SEASON IS STILLON YEAR ROUND.
SO IF YOU WANT TO HUNT THEM FORSPORT OR JUST CATCH ONE ROOTING
THROUGH YOUR GARBAGE AND GAS ITIN A BUCKET USING YOUR CAR
EXHAUST, YOU GO TO TOWN,SPECIFICALLY BRASSTOWN,
NORTH CAROLINA. NEXT UP, IFI KNOW TWO THINGS, IT'S THAT
CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND THATBREAKFAST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
MEAL OF THE DAY SO IT LOGICALLYFOLLOWS THAT CHILDREN'S
BREAKFASTS MUST BE THE MOSTIMPORTANT MEAL OF THE FUTURE.
BUT A DISTURBING NEW REPORT ISUPENDING EVERYTHING WE THOUGHT
WE KNEW ABOUT THIS COMPLETEBREAKFAST.
>> WE HAVE A NEW MEDICAL ALERTNOW WITH A WARNING FOR PARENTS
THAT FORTIFIED CEREAL WE GIVEOUR KIDS TO GIVE THEM VITAMINS
MAY BE DOING MORE HARM THANGOOD.
>> MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AREEATING CEREAL WITH POTENTIALLY
UNHEALTHY AMOUNTS OF VITAMIN A,ZINC AND NIACIN.
>> WE'RE OVERFORTIFYING OURCEREALS.
>> Stephen: YOU MANIACS.
YOU OVERFORTIFIED THEM.
THE TRIX RABBIT TRIED TO WARNUS.
TRIX AREN'T FOR KIDS.
AND, SONNY, YES, HE WAS COO-COO,BUT COO-COO FOR THE TRUTH THAT
WE WEREN'T READY TO HEAR.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OFMY... MY EPHEREAL-- IT'S BEGUN
TO AFFECT MY SPEECH.
A WAG OF THE FINGER TO CEREALMANUFACTURERS.
YOUR PRECIOUS VITAMIN-PACKINGLEFT OUR CHILDREN VULNERABLE TO
LIVER DAMAGE, RASHES AND IMMUNEPROBLEMS ALL BECAUSE WHEN KIDS'
CEREALS ARE FORTIFIED, NUTRIENTSARE ADDED IN AMOUNTS CALCULATED
FOR ADULTS, WHICH ITSELF ISRIDICULOUS.
ADULTS WOULD NEVER EAT THOSECHILDISH FOODS FOR BREAKFAST.
WE PREFER THE SOPHISTICATEDTASTE OF POP-TARTS WILDLICIOUS.
THEY'RE BAKED WITH REAL FRUITASTERISK.
SO UNTIL OUR CEREAL CAN BEDENUTRITIONED TO SAFE
FORTIFICATION LEVELS, PLEASE,PARENTS, FEED YOUR CHILDREN
SOMETHING THAT'S JUST ASCOLORFUL BUT BETTER FOR THEM,
LIKE THE BOX.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
