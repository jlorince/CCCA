ANYWAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE'RE LOOKING AT FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS GUY, AND THANKS TO OBAMACARE, WE MIGHT LIVE TO SEE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE DID WE GO WRONG?
THE REPUBLICANS HAD EVERYTHING GOING FOR THEM: A TERRIBLE ECONOMY, AN UNPOPULAR INCUMBENT,
AND A POSITIVE MESSAGE FOR THE AMERICAN VOTER:  LESS THAN HALF OF YOU ARE PARASITES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND STILL -- STILL WE LOST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND WITH AMERICA'S CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, IT ONLY LOOKS BLEAKER FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE
FUTURE, UNLESS SCIENCE CAN FIND A WAY FOR LATINO WOMEN TO GIVE BIRTH TO OLD WHITE MEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE IS THE FUNDING, KOCH BROTHERS?!
GET ON IT!
'CAUSE IT'S BAD.
IT'S BAD, FOLKS.
IN 2012 THE GOP LOST THE PRESIDENCY, LOST THE SENATE, AND LOST THE VOTE COUNT IN THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES BY A COMBINED 1.1 MILLION VOTES.
REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN ASS-PADDLING LIKE THAT SINCE DC SHUT DOWN MADAME KINK'S RUMP DUNGEON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF IT'S WEDNESDAY, ASK FOR THE TRICKLE-DOWN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND IT'S GETTING SO BAD, THAT TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY NEXT TIME, REPUBLICANS MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE
THEIR MESSAGING OR THEIR POLICIES OR THE CONSTITUENCIES THEY SERVE.
THANKFULLY, THERE'S A BETTER ANSWER AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WIN, LOSE, OR REDRAW.
NOW, CONSERVATIVES, DON'T WELD YOUR BUNKER DOOR SHUT JUST YET.
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THINGS LOOK, THERE IS ONE PLACE REPUBLICANS DID HOLD ON TO POWER.
>> REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO HOLD A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: YES, EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST THE COMBINED VOTE, THE GOP KEPT CONTROL OF THE
HOUSE BY A 33-SEAT MARGIN.
AND THEY DID IT WITHOUT WATERING DOWN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW DID THE REPUBLICAN DOZEN IT?
-- DID THE REPUBLICANS DO IT?
WITH A LITTLE THING CALLED "GERRYMANDERING."
[ LAUGHTER ]
SEE, IN 2010, REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE NATION REDREW CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS
TO MAKE THEM A LOCK FOR THE GOP-- AND IN SOME CASES, JUST TO SEND DEMOCRATS A MESSAGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF GERRYMANDERING: INSTEAD OF VOTERS GETTING TO PICK THEIR
LEADERS, LEADERS GET TO PICK THEIR VOTERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I SAY WHY NOT?
WE SHOULD TRUST OUR LEADERS.
AFTER ALL, WE VOTED FOR THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, NOW THAT THE GOP HAS ITS GERRYMANDER GAME DOWN, THEY'RE READY TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS IN THE KEY SWING STATES OF MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA AND
VIRGINIA ARE LINING UP BEHIND.
"PROPOSALS THAT WOULD ALLOCATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES BY CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICT." AS A SUPPORTER OF THIS IDEA, PENNSYLVANIA STATE SENATOR DOMINIC PILEGGI ARGUES, THE
CURRENT "WINNER-TAKE-ALL SYSTEM IS INHERENTLY UNFAIR BECAUSE THE LOSING PARTY GETS NO CREDIT IN
THE ELECTORAL COUNT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, THE LOSING PARTY NEVER GETS TO PICK THE PRESIDENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS LEGISLATION JUST ALLOWS REPUBLICANS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE IS THE GREAT PART: 'CUZ IF YOU APPLIED THIS PLAN TO THE 2012 ELECTION, EVEN THOUGH
FIVE MILLION MORE PEOPLE VOTED FOR DEMOCRAT, THE REPUBLICAN WOULD HAVE WON THE PRESIDENCY BY
22 ELECTORAL VOTES.
IT'S WIN, WIN!
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S A CINDERELLA STORY!
IT'S LIKE ROCKY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WILL ADMIT FREELY THAT IT'S NOT EXACTLY MAJORITY RULE, BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
SOMETIMES THE MAJORITY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO I SAY --
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO DO IT, REPUBLICANS, OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, OUR SOCIETY'S VALUES WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE
ALONG WITH ITS DEMOGRAPHICS, SO YOU MUST LISTEN TO THESE VOTERS AND THEN MAKE SURE THEY CANNOT
