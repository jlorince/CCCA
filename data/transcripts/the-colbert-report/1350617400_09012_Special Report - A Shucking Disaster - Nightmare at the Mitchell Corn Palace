CORN SIRRUP.
BUT SADLY, FOLKS THIS
DROUGHT AFFECTS MORE THAN
JUST MY FILLET MIN NOUGAT T
IS ALSO THREATENING A
NATIONAL PRESSURE-- TREASURE.
JIM?
>> CORN, IT'S AS AMERICAN AS
APPLE PIE.
AND THANKS TO HIGH FRUCTOSE
CORN SYRUP T IS APPLE PIE.
CORN IS SO AMERICAN, THAT
THERE IS A MONUMENT TO IT.
THE CORN PALACE IN MITCHELL,
SOUTH DAKOTA.
PALACE DIRECTOR MARK
SHELLING.
>> THE CORN PALACE ATTRACTS
A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE PER
YEAR.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST MONUMENT
TO CORN THAT WE HAVE IN THE
ENTIRE WORLD.
>> NOT ONLY IS THE BIGGEST,
IT'S ALSO THE ONLIEST.
PEOPLE DRIVE FROM PRESUMABLY
ELSEWHERE TO SEE THE MURR
ALLS MADE OF 12 DIFFERENT
COLORS OF CORN.
>> SINCE 1892 WE HAVE BEEN
REDECORATING THE CORN PALACE
WITH A NEW THEME EACH YEAR.
PEOPLE REALLY CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT THE MURR ALLS ARE MADE
OUT OF CORN UNTIL THEY
EXPERIENCE IT AND SEE IT FOR
THEMSELVES.
AND THEY START SAYING, THAT
IS AN EAR OF CORN, WOW, THIS
IS TRULY AMAZING.
>> BUT A DROUGHT IN THE
HEARTLAND HAS THREATENED
THIS ANNUAL TRADITION.
THE WORLD'S ONLY CORN PALACE
HAS BROUGHT IN TOURISTS TO
MITCHELL FOR A NUMBER OF
DECADES.
THE DROUGHT THIS YEAR MAY
TAKE ITS TOLL ON THE CORN
USED TO MAKE THOSE MURR
ALLS.
>> BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT,
FOUR OF THE COLORS THAT WE
WOULD TYPICALLY USE IN OUR
MURR ALL DESIGNS ARE NOT
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR US
THIS YEAR.
>> WE'VE SEEN THE CRUSHED
FARMING COMMUNITIES.
WE'VE BEEN WARNED ABOUT
RISING FOOD AND FUEL PRICES.
BUT NO ONE PREPARED US FOR
LESS VIBRANT CORN MURR ALLS.
THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT,"
SPECIAL REPORT.
A SCHUKING DISASTER.
NICE MAYOR AT THE MITCHELL
CORN PALACE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE CORN PALACE WAS BUILT IN
1892.
THE COMMUNITY LEADERS WERE
LOOKING FOR A WAY TO MAKE
MITCHELL UNIQUE.
WHAT'S GOING TO PUT MITCHELL
ON THE MAP.
SO THEY SAID WE WANT A
PALACE MADE OF CORN.
>> AND IT WORKED.
AS ANYONE WOULD AGREE,
MITCHELL SOUTH DAKOTA IS
CERTAINLY ON A MAP.
TODAY THE CORN PALACE STANDS
AS A PROUD REMINDER OF JUST
HOW AMAZING CORN IS.
>> CORN IS AMAZING.
IF YOU GET THE PUN THERE.
>> WHAT?
>> THE CORN --
>> WHAT IS THE PUN?
>> MAZE.
>> YES.
>> MAZE IS THE ANCIENT WORD
FOR CORN.
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T SPEAK
ANCIENT, SORRY.
WHAT IS THAT?
>> THE CORN-- CORN THAT WE
HAVE IN AMERICA WAS
CONSIDERED MAZE BY THE
NATIVE AMERICANS.
>> RIGHT.
>> SO THEN WE OFTEN USE THE
THEME IT'S A-MAZING.
OUR CORN PALACE IS AMAZING
BECAUSE IT'S DECORATED WITH
THE CORN AND THE MAZE.
AND THEN WE SPELL IT WITH
THE MAIZ, RATHER THAN MAZE.
>> I'M SORRY, I'M NOT
EXACTLY FOLLOWING.
>> IT'S A PUN.
>> ANYWAY, CORN IS AMAZING.
>> AND THIS YEAR'S MURR ALLS
WERE DESIGNED BY LOCAL
AVANT-COULD BE ARTIST SHERRY
RAMSDALE.
>> CORN ART IS A RATHER
COMPLEX PROCESS.
SOME OF THE ARTISTS I DRAW
INSPIRATION FROM ARE A
COUPLE OF THE MASTER,
OBVIOUSLY LEONARDO DA VINCI,
MICHELANGELO.
>> HER VISION IS THEN
BROUGHT TO LIFE BY
PROFESSIONAL CORN HANGER DAN
McLEOD.
>> I HAVE BEEN HANGING CORN
ON THE CORN PALACE FOR OVER
TEN YEARS.
>> AND CORN HANGING ISN'T
JUST AN ART, IT'S A SCIENCE.
>> WHEN I'M GOING TO TRY TO
EXPLAIN IS I THINK IT'S THE
SCIENCE PART OF IT.
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE, AND IT'S
A PART OF THE ART TOO.
I MEAN IT'S ALL MIXED
TOGETHER IN ONE BUNCH.
>> IF YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT
IT WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH.
YEAH, THE IMPRINT WOULD BE
THERE BUT IT WOULDN'T STAND
OUT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO
SAY, AND COME ALIVE.
>> BUT THIS YEAR MARK
RECEIVED THE PHONE CALL THAT
EVERY CORN PALACE DIRECTOR
DREADS.
>> THE FOUR COLORS THAT WE
WILL NOT HAVE THIS YEAR ARE
ORANGE VAR GATED, BLUE, CALL
I COAND LIGHT BROWN --
>> MOST DEVASTATING COLOR
THAT I LOST WAS BLUE.
BECAUSE IT DOMINATED A LOT
OF THE SKY, A LOT OF THE
AREA OF THE MURR ALLS.
>> AFTER A CENTURY OF
TRADITION, MITCHELL WAS IN A
CORN HOLE.
>> I KIND OF HAD A PIT IN MY
STOMACH AND THOUGHT NOW
WHAT.
>> SO WHAT?
>> WELL, THEY HAVE THE
CHOICE EITHER TO LEAVE THE
OLD MURR ALLS UP FOR ANOTHER
YEAR OR FOR ME TO REDESIGN
THE MURR ALLS WITH THE
COLORS THAT THEY THOUGHT
WOULD BE AVAILABLE.
>> WHAT CAN WE DO?
WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING.
>> WITHOUT A COLONEL OF HOPE
MARK MADE A GAME CHANGING
DECISION.
>> WE DECIDED TO MOVE
FORWARD WAY CORN MURR ALLS
BUT INSTEAD OF USING THE
NORMAL 12 COLORS THAT WE
HAVE, WE WILL BE USING
EIGHT.
>> A BOLD BUT NECESSARY
MOVE.
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST
MITCHELL'S CORN PALACE, THIS
IS AMERICA'S CORN PALACE.
>> IT'S HARD TO ENVISION THE
UNITED STATES WITHOUT A CORN
PALACE.
BUT IF IT WERE TO GO AWAY I
THINK WE WOULD LOSE ONE OF
AMERICA'S GREAT ICONS,
LANDMARKS.
AND EVERY TIME YOU LOSE ONE
OF THOSE AMERICAN TRADITIONS,
IT JUST HURTS MORE AND MORE.
>> THE BIGGEST THING THAT I
HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHEN I TALK
TO THEM IS THEY'LL GO I
NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKE
THIS EXISTED.
YOU KNOW, IT'S AWESOME.
>> OR IN OTHER WORDS,
IRRESISTABLE.
GET IT?
>> YEAH.
>> IT'S LIKE YOUR PUN.
>> A-MAIZE.
>> BUT AS IN EAR OF CORN.
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.
>> YOU HAVE.
>> A LOT OF TIMES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE'S JUST
GOING THROW AWAY THE OLD
CORN WHEN THEY TAKE IT DOWN
AT THE END OF THE SEASON, I
KNOW SOME DIABETIC COWS THAT
COULD REALLY USE THE
