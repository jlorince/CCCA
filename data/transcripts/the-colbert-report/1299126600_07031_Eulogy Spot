EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, I JUST WANT TO TAKE A
MOMENT HERE TO GIVE A SPECIAL
WELCOME TO MY JEWISH VIEWERS.
I ASSUME SOME OF YOU STAY OVER
FROM JON STEWART.
[LAUGHTER]
HE IS, I BELIEVE, YOUR VERSION
OF THE 700 CLUB.
[LAUGHTER]
IT IS IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK FOR
THE CHOSEN PEOPLE AS THEY'VE
BEEN CHOSEN TO BE ON THE
RECEIVING END OF ABUSIVE
LANGUAGE FROM THE LIKES OF
CHRISTIAN DIOR DESIGNER JOHN GAL
YAWNO, JULIAN ASSANGE AND
CHARLIE SHEEN WHO I ASSUME ARE
ALL TRYING TO BE ON A REALITY
SHOW WHO WANTS TO BE A
MILLIONAIRE WHO BLAMES PROBLEMS
ON THE JEWS.
NOW MY HERO THE POPE.
>> STRONG WORDS OUT OF VATICAN
CITY AS EXPERTS OF A BOOK BY
POPE BENEDICT MADE IT CLEAR JEWS
SHOULD NOT BE PWRAEUPLD FOR
JESUS' DEATH.
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS,
JEWS.
IT'S OVER.
OLLY OLLY HAVA NAGILA FREE!
BEST OF ALL, I BELIEVE THIS
MEANS YOU CAN EAT BACON AGAIN.
TKPWURG TO LOVE IT.
ON A RELATED SUBJECT -- I'M
GRATEFUL FOR MY FAITH BECAUSE IT
HELPS ME GRAPPLE WITH THE BIG
QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER DEATH?
IS THERE A SOUL?
AND IF I GO TO HEAVEN CAN I
STILL HOLD ON TO MY EARTHLY
RESENTMENTS?
I'M COMFORTED TO HEAR ABOUT A
NEW TREND IN DEATH
ANNOUNCEMENTS.
SALON MAGAZINE IS REPORTING ON
OBITUARYIES THAT INCLUDE PLEAS
LIKE THIS ONE IN LIEU OF FLOWERS
PLEASE MAKE A DONATION TO ANYONE
RUNNING AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.
IT MAKES SENSE, THE MID TERM
SHOWS US ANTI-OBAMA SENTIMENTS
TEND TO BE STRONGER AMONG THE
ELDERLY.
IT STANDS TO BE REASON HE WOULD
BE LESS POPULAR AMONG THE POST
ELDERLY.
THIS GIVES A WHOLE NEW VOICE TO
AMERICA'S EXTREMELY SILENT
MAJORITY.
NOW A FUNERAL IS NOT ONLY A TIME
FOR QUIET COULDN'T PLACE --
COULDN'T THEM PLACING OF
MORTALITY BUT IT'S A CHANCE TO
PUSH PET POLITICAL CAUSES.
MOM WOULD HAVE WANTED IT THAT
WAY.
BE CAREFUL, FOLKS, BEFORE YOU
MAKE A DONATION BASED ON AN
ANTI--OWE BALM OBITUARIES GET
PROOF THE PERSON DIED IN
AMERICA.
