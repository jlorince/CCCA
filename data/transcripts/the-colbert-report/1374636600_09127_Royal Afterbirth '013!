[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT, I
FEEL LIKE I JUST WALKED INTO A
SURPRISE PARTY.
BIG STORY TONIGHT, EVERYBODY.
OVER 500 AL QAEDA LEADERS HAVE
ESCAPED FROM ABU GHRAIB PRISON
IN IRAQ AND WITH IRAQ FACING
OVER A THOUSAND SECTARIAN
KILLINGS A MONTH, EXPERTS FEAR
THE COUNTRY IS PLUNGING ONCE
AGAIN INTO A BLOODY CIVIL WAR.
FOR MORE, GO SOME PLACE ELSE
BECAUSE THERE'S A ROYAL BABY!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOR YET ANOTHER GENERATION, THE
ROYAL FAMILY WAS NOT RENDERED
STERILE THROUGH INBREEDING.
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR YET
ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT PRESENTS
"ROYAL AFTER BIRTH: LABOR PARTY.
FETAL ATTRACTION.
BIRTHING-HIPS HOORAH: THE PRINCE
OF WAILS:
>> Stephen: THIS AFTERNOON THE
ROYAL COUPLE FINALLY EMERGED
HOLDING THE YET AS UNNAMED NEW
PRINCE-CAMBRIDGE.
OF COURSE KATE'S A TREND SETTER.
LADIES, THIS IS THE NEW STANDARD
FOR WHAT YOU MUST LOOK LIKE LESS
THAN 24 HOURS AFTER GIVING
BIRTH: SMILING, GLAMOROUS, HAIR
PERFECT, RADIANT AND FRESH.
OKAY.
STEP UP YOUR GAME.
ONCE THE BABY WAS OUT, IT WAS
TIME FOR THE COUPLE TO GO HOME.
>> THEY'RE COMING OUT AGAIN.
LIKE EVERY MODERN PARENT NOW,
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR CAR SEAT
READY.
I'M ALSO IMPRESSED BY HOW THIS
BABY IS ABLE TO HANDLE ALL OF
THE NOISE.
>> WILLIAM IS GOING TO DRIVE THE
RANGE HOME.
THAT IS SO COOL.
>> Reporter: THAT IS SO COOL.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I MUST SAY AS A TRADITIONALIST,
I AM DISAPPOINTED THEY DIDN'T
TAKE THE BABY HOME ON
PEASANT-BACK.
OF COURSE THERE ARE STILL MAJOR
QUESTIONS LEFT UNANSWERED WHAT
WILL HIS NAME BE?
WE KNOW IT HAS A HEAD BUT WHAT
WILL BE ON THAT HEAD?
A FACE?
>> THE CHILD IS LIKELY TO HAVE
KATE'S EYES, DARK HAIR AND
DARKER SKIN.
AND WILL'S LIPS AND ROYAL NOSE,
ALSO SEEN ON PRINCE PHILIP,
CHARLES AND HARRY.
>> Stephen: MAYBE, BUT WE HEAR
AT THE REPORT HAVE OUR OWN
COMPUTER-GENERATED SPECUJECTION
OF WHAT THE BABY MIGHT LOOK LIKE
IF HE GETS THE QUEEN'S EYES,
PRINCE CHARLES' EARS AND AN
ENGLISHMAN'S TEETH.
THEY'RE SO CUTE AT THAT
