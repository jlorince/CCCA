SHE LOOKED GREAT WITH THE NEW HAIR EXTENSIONS.
NOW, THEY TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT MITT HAD ONE ACE IN THE HOLE, LIBYA GATE.
>> ROMNEY AND HIS RUNNING MATE HAVE BEEN HAMMERING THE PRESIDENT OVER THIS COVERUP FOR WEEKS.
AMERICANS ARE ASKING, WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW?  WHEN DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW IT?  WHICH ONE IS LIBYA?  AND LAST NIGHT,
LAST NIGHT, LAST NIGHT, MITT HAD OBAMA IN HIS SIGHTS.
>> IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK.
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THAT TO BE TOLD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHETHER THAT WAS SOME MISLEADING OR INSTEAD WHETHER WE
JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW.
>> THE SUGGESTION THAT ANYBODY ON MY TEAM, FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE, U.N. AMBASSADOR, ANYBODY ON MY TEAM WOULD PLAY
POLITICS OR MISLEAD WHEN WE LOST FOUR OF OUR OWN, GOVERNOR, IS OFFENSIVE.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE DO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS NOT WHAT I DO AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
>> Colbert: OKAY, OKAY, OBAMA LANDED A GOOD PUNCH, BUT THEN ROMNEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT THE QUESTION THAT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.
>> I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID SOMETHING WHICH, WHICH IS THAT ON THE DAY
AFTER THE ATTACK HE WENT INTO THE ROSE GARDEN AND SAID THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR.
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
>> YOU SAID IN THE ROSE GARDEN THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK IT WAS AN ACT OF TERROR.
IT WAS NOT A SPONTANEOUS DEMONSTRATION?  IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
>> PLEASE PROCEED, GOVERNOR.
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT FOR THE RECORD BECAUSE IT TOOK THE PRESIDENT 14 DAYS BEFORE HE CALLED THE ATTACK IN
BENGHAZI AN ACT OF TERROR.
>> GET THE TRANSCRIPT.
>> HE DID, IN FACT, SIR. SO LET ME CALL IT AN ACT OF TERROR --
>> CAN YOU SAY THAT A LITTLE LOUDER, CANDY?
>> HE DID CALL IT AN ACT OF TERROR.
>> Colbert: NO, NO, NO, NO, IT IS   SUPPOSED TO CHANGE EVERYTHING THE OTHER WAY.
ARE YOU OKAY?  LOOK, OBAMA DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY ACT OF TERROR, DID HE, JIM?
>> NO ACTS OF TERROR WILL EVER SHAKE THE RESOLVE OF THIS GREAT NATION.
>> OKAY BUT ACTS OF TERROR COULD REFER TO ANYTHING.
I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW HE IS TALKING ABOUT BENGHAZI IN THAT BENGHAZI SPEECH THE DAY AFTER THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS?  HE COULD
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BELOVED CHARACTER ACTOR BEN GAZZARA BECAUSE FOLKSILY TELL YOU THERE IS A SCANDAL THAT HE DOES NOT
GET MORE ROLES.
WHAT?  GAZZARA IS DEAD?  HAPPENED ON OBAMA'S WATCH.
>> FOLKS, THAT'S TRUE.
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MITT'S MOMENT OF CHEST THUMPING DOMINANCE OVER THE CARCASS OF HIS OPPONENT, AND IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOO IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT MEDDLING MODERATOR.
>> DID GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAVE TWO OPPONENTS ON THAT STAGE.
>> IT WAS DISGRACEFUL WHAT CANDY CROWLEY DID.
>> SHE INSERTED HER SELF AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO THIS DEBATE.
>> Colbert: CANDY STUCK HER NOSE INTO IT IN THE WRONG PLACE.
>> THE PROBLEM WAS THE TIME FOR FACT CHECKING IS AFTER THE EVENT, NOT DURING IT.
SHE MADE A GIGANTIC MISTAKE.
>> Colbert: YES!, YES!  OH!  I AGREE.
WE ARE ALL ANGRY, YES!  THE TIME FOR FACT CHECKING IS AFTER THE EVENT, WHEN VOTERS HAVE STOPPED WATCHING.
WE SHOULD NOT BE SULLYING THEIR EMOTIONAL REACTION
