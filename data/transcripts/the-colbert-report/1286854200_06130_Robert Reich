OH, THEY'RE HUNGRY FOR FLOOD.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER
LABOR SECRETARY AND HAS A NEW
BOOK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE
U.S. ECONOMY.
I CAN TELL YOU THE FUTURE OF THE
U.S. ECONOMY, AND IT AIN'T
BOOKS.
PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT REICH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SIR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'VE MET ON THE SATELLITE
BEFORE BUT NEVER IN PERSON.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY AN HONOR.
>> Stephen: YOU REALLY SEE
MORE REAL.
>> IN REAL.
>> Stephen: IN REAL.
IT'S AMAZING, 3-D DOES YOU GOOD
GRACES.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOUR NEW BOOK
IS CALLED "AFTER SHOCK: THE NEXT
ECONOMY AND AMERICA'S FUTURE."
IT IS A SLENDER VOLUME.
( LAUGHTER )
DOES THAT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE
NEXT ECONOMY?
IT'S A RATHER THIN DOSSIER.
>> IT'S MUCH HARDER TO WRITE
SMALL BOOK THAN A VERY LARGE
BOOK.
I WANTED TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE
SO PEOPLE CAN READ IT AND
UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE GOING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE NEED TO DO?
YOU'RE ONE OF THESE REDISTRIBUTE
THE WEALTH GUYS.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK RICH
PEOPLE HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY AND
YOU WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON GUYS
LIKE ME AND THAT'S CLASS
WARFARE.
>> I'M NOT A CLASS WARRIOR, I'M
A CLASS WORRIER --
W-O-R-R-I-E-R.
>> Stephen: YOUR CLEVERNESS
WILL NOT PROTECT YOU.
>> HERE'S WHAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT, SO MUCH OF THE WEALTH IS
GOING TO THE TOP, THE VAST
MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING CLASS,
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO
BUY ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE
PRODUCED BY THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
AT FULL EMPLOYMENT.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T GET OUT OF
THE GREAT RECESSION.
>> Stephen: BUT GUYS LIKE ME,
AND I'M RIGHT UP THERE IN THAT
TOP ECHELON, OKAY, I EARNED IT.
NOBODY GAVE IT TO ME.
I'M UP THERE, AND I AM A GOAL
FOR THOSE PEOPLE.
IF I'M NOT UP THERE UNTAXED,
THEY'VE GOT NOTHING TO DREAM
ABOUT.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT'S HEAVEN FOR?
THIS IS HEAVEN RIGHT HERE.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: SO IF YOU... YOU
KNOW YOU CAN'T CREATE JOBS BY
TAXING RICH PEOPLE.
NO ONE EVERY BECAME RICH BY
TAXING A RICH GUY.
>> HERE'S THE POINT.
YOU WOULD DO BETTER WITH SMALLER
SHARE OF A RAPIDLY GROWING
ECONOMY THAT WOULD BE RAPIDLY
GROWING BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE LAD
MONEY TO BUY INTO IT, THAN YOU
WILL DO WITH A LARGE SHARE OF A
ECONOMY THAT IS ALMOST DEAD IN
THE WATER.
>> Stephen: WHY, WHY, WHY?
I STILL HAVE ALL MY MONEY.
IF THE ECONOMY GOES IN THE
TOILET, THEN EVERYTHING BECOMES
CHEAP AND I CAN JUST GOBBLE UP
THE OF THE WORLD AS A RICH
PERSON.
I WOULD NEVER DO THIS BECAUSE
I'M A GOOD GUY, BUT I'M JUST
SPEAKING AS A RICH GUY.
I CAN GO OUT THERE AND GOBBLE UP
REAL ESTATE IN EVERY DIRECTION
BECAUSE I HAVE CASH TO DO SOME
AGAIN, I'M NOT MR. POTTER, BUT
MR. POTTER KEPT HIS HEAD DURING
THE DEPRESSION AND GOBBLED UP
THE TOWN.
ISN'T THAT THE LESSON OF THAT
MOVIE?
KEEP YOUR MONEY AND GOBBLE UP
THE TOWN?
>> YES, BUT THAT MOVIE...
REMEMBER THE POTTERSTOWN, IT WAS
AN AWFUL, ANGRY PLACE.
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE POTENTIALLY
CREATING IF PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AND
ANXIOUS AND FRUSTRATED AND
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR INCOMES, NOT
ONLY DOES THE ECONOMY NOT GROW,
BUT ALSO WE HAVE AN UGLY, ANGRY
POLITICS.
>> Stephen: IF WE HAVE UGLY,
ANGRY POLITICS, THAT GIVES ME
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT EVERY
NIGHT, AND I GET RICHER.
( LAUGHTER )
JUST SPEAKING AS A PUNDIT, NOT
AS A HUMAN.
( LAUGHTER
( APPLAUSE )
SO YOU SAY THERE IS AN ENORMOUS
GAP.
>> YES.
THE GAP REALLY, TODAY'S GAP IS
BETWEEN PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP,
AND THIS IS NOT RESENTMENT
POLITICS, THIS IS JUST PLAIN
ECONOMICS.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T RESENT
THE RICH?
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU LET YOUR
DAUGHTER DATE A RICH PERSON?
>> IF I HAD ONE.
I HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER.
BUT SHE'S ONLY TWO.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I THINK... BUT THE POINT IS
THAT THERE IS SO MUCH... THE
LAST TIME WE HAD THIS MUCH
WEALTH AND INCOME AT THE VERY
TOP WAS 1928, AND YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED IN 1929.
>> Stephen: UH, UH, THE JAZZ
SINGER.
WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A HUGE
TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION IN
ENTERTAINMENT.
>> YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T GET OUT OF
THE GREAT RECESSION IF WE HAVE
JUST A GAP THAT ESSENTIALLY ROBS
THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING
CLASS OF THE KIND OF MONEY THEY
NEED TO GO AND BUY ALL THE
THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE PRODUCED
IN THE ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: HOW DID WE GET
HERE?
IS IT OUR FAULT?
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
WE'VE HAD A GREAT ECONOMY FOR A
LONG TIME.
NOW THAT THINGS HAVE GONE SOUTH,
WHY ARE YOU PUNISHING GUYS LIKE
ME?
>> REALLY THERE'S NO PUNISHMENT.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, FOR 30
YEARS, THE WAGE OF THE WORKER
SMACK IN THE MIDDLE DID NOT
RISE.
MALE WORKERS ACTUALLY SAW NO
RISE.
THE ONLY WAY FAMILIES COULD
CONTINUE BUYING STUFF IS IF
WOMEN WENT INTO THE PAID
WORKFORCE AND THEN IF PEOPLE
WORKED LONGER HOURS AND FINALLY
IF FAMILIES BORROWED MORE AND
MORE AND MORE AGAINST THEIR
HOMES.
BUT YOU CAN'T SUSTAIN THAT.
FINALLY THAT DEBT BUBBLE
COLLAPSED.
IT BURST.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S NEXT?
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT
ECONOMY?
WHAT IS AMERICA'S FUTURE?
>> YOU HAVE TO READ THE BOOK.
>> Stephen: I WON'T DO THAT.
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY, AND IT
SEEMS LIKE MY LENGTH OF A BOOK,
BUT I JUST WON'T DO IT.
( LAUGHTER )
OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD.
>> HERE'S THE CHOICE WE'VE GOT.
EITHER WE HAVE REFORM, AND IN
THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE ALWAYS
CHOSEN, WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE
NATURE OF THE PROBLEM, WE ALWAYS
CHOOSE REFORM, REFORM THAT
ENLARGES THE CIRCLE OF
PROSPERITY FOR MOST PEOPLE, OR
WE HAVE A BACKLASH, AN ANGRY
POLITICS THAT STARTS PICKING ON
IMMIGRANTS OR STARTS PICKING ON
FOREIGN TRADE OR STARTS BLAMING
THE POOR OR BLAMES EVEN THE
RICH.
I MEAN, WE...
>> Stephen: GO BACK THE THAT
BLAMING THE RICH FOR A SECOND.
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT IF WE
DO NOT GIVE THE POOR AND THE
MIDDLE CLASS WHAT THEY NEED THAT
THEY WILL GANG UP TOGETHER ON
RICH PEOPLE AND TAKE AWAY MORE
FROM US THAN WE SHOULD GIVE THEM
IN THE MEANTIME?
( LAUGHTER )
>> THAT COULD HAPPEN.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: I MIGHT NEED TO
READ THIS BOOK.
ROBERT REICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN, GREAT TO SEE
