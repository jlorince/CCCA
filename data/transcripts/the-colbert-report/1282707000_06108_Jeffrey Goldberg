MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT FOR "THE ATLANTIC"
MAGAZINE, AND HE IS HERE TO
DISCUSS THE NEXT POTENTIAL WAR
IN THE MIDEAST.
I HOPE IT'S THE ONE WHERE JESUS
COMES BACK.
PLEASE WELCOME JEFFREY GOLDBERG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MR. GOLDBERG, THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
NOW, SIR, YOU JUST SAW A LITTLE
DIORAMA BATTLE THAT I HAD OVER
THERE.
IRAN IS CLEARLY A THREAT,
CORRECT?
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: CORRECT.
NOW YOU'VE GOT THIS ARTICLE HERE
IN "THE ATLANTIC" MAGAZINE.
AND IT IS CALLED "ISRAEL IS
GETTING READY TO BOMB IRAN: HOW,
WHY AND WHAT IT MEANS."
OKAY.
WHY?
HOW?
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DO IT?
>> WITH AIRPLANES THAIMP GOING
TO USE THEIR AIR FORCE.
>> Stephen: WHY?
>> BECAUSE IRAN THEY THINK POSES
AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
>> PROBABLY A SERIES OF PRETTY
BAD THINGS FOR ALL PARTIES
INVOLVED, IRAN, ISRAEL...
>> Stephen: WE'RE FOR IRAN
BECAUSE IRAN IS PUSHING THE
WORLD'S BUTTON BY THREATENING TO
PUSH THEIR BUTONS.
IRAN SAID ISRAEL IS...
>> WHOSE BUTTONS?
>> Stephen: THEY'RE PUSHING
OUR EMOTIONAL BUTTONS BY
THREATNING TO PUSH THEIR
BUTTONS.
ISRAEL SEES IT AS A THREAT
BECAUSE IRAN HAS SAID THEIR GOAL
IS TO WIPE ISRAEL OFF THE MAP.
>> WELL, THE ISRAELI CALCULUS IS
VERY SIMPLE.
IRAN SAYS THEY SEEK THE
DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.
THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
THIS IS WHAT MOST OF THE WORLD
BELIEVES.
ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS TWO TO THE
ISRAELIS.
WE CAN'T LET THIS COUNTRY
DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPON IF THEY
SEEK OUR DESTRUCTION.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY IRAN POSES
THREATS TO OTHER AREAS OF THE
MIDDLE EAST.
THEY POSE A NATIONAL SECURITY
THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES.
THEY'RE A DECLARED ENEMY OF THE
UNITED STATES, BUT FOR ISRAEL,
THEY FEEL BECAUSE OF THEIR
HISTORY, BECAUSE OF THEIR
LOCATION, BECAUSE OF THEIR
VULNERABILITY, THEY FEEL IT'S AN
USUALLY URGENT THREAT.
>> Stephen: FOR SOME REASON
THEY'RE PARANOID ABOUT PEOPLE
WHO WANT THEM DEAD HAVING A
NUCLEAR BOMB.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY SHOULDN'T
ISRAEL GO IN THERE RIGHT NOW?
A FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR AND
PRESENT WALRUS, JOHN BOLTON
EIGHT DAYS AGO... SORRY, SEVEN
DAYS AGO SAID THAT WE HAD EIGHT
DAYS TO BOMB IRAN.
OKAY.
WE GOT ONE DAY LEFT.
>> ONE DAY LEFT.
>> Stephen: ONE DAY LEFT TO
BOMB IRAN.
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN.
BUT WHY SHOULDN'T THEY BOMB
IRAN?
THIS IS LIKE THE CUBAN MISSILE
CRISIS.
KENNEDY SAID GET THEM OUT OF
THERE OR WE'RE GOING TOE TO TOE.
>> BUT THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
ENDED WITHOUT ATTACK.
>> Stephen: BUT THE RUSSIANS
ARE, COMPARABLELY SPEAKING,
FRIENDS COMPARED THE IRAN.
>> I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US
WERE ALIVE THEN, BUT I DON'T
THINK...
>> I WAS BORN FOR ABOUT 30
YEARS.
THE RUSSIANS AREN'T CRAZY.
MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD IS WAITING
FOR THE 12th IMAM TO COME.
>> WE THOUGHT THE RUSSIANS WERE
CRAZY AT THE TIME.
WHEN YOU HAVE A RELIGIOUS
LEADERSHIP THAT THEY'RE SEEKING
THE AFTER LIFE, THEY THINK THE
AFTER LIFE WILL BE BETTER THAN
THIS LIFE...
>> Stephen: THE WRONG
RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP SEEKING THE
WRONG AFTER LIFE.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GO THERE.
>> Stephen: I JUST WENT THERE.
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU THERE.
>> I SUGGEST YOU DON'T GO THERE.
THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE.
THE POINT IS, YES, ON THE ONE
HAND, THEY'RE UNSTABLE, CRAZY
LEADERSHIP.
ON THE OTHER HAND, BAD THINGS
WOULD FLOW FROM A DECISION TO
BOMB IRAN, EITHER BY ISRAEL OR
BY THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE WE DOING
RIGHT NOW?
WHAT'S OBAMA DOING?
HE SEEMS PRETTY WEEK ON THIS.
>> NO, NO, NO.
OBAMA HASN'T MET ANYBODY, BUT
HE'S ACTUALLY IN MY PERSONAL
OPINION, HE'S BEEN STRONG ON
THIS ISSUE, VERY STRONG IN FACT.
HE HAS A VERY DELIBERATE PLAN IN
PLACE TO SEEK ENGAGEMENT ON THE
ONE HAND AND USE SANCTIONS AND
PRETTY STRONG MULTILATERAL
SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN TO TRY TO
CONCENTRATE THEIR ATTENTION ON
THIS.
AND FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THE
FACT THAT IF THEY GIVE UP THIS
PATH, IF THEY STOP SEEKING
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, GOOD THINGS
WILL HAPPEN TO THEM, I THINK
HE'S ON A VERY TOUGH PATH.
>> Stephen: WHO ARE THE OTHER
PEOPLE, WHO ARE THE OTHER PEOPLE
ON HERE?
>> EUROPE, RUSSIANS.
>> Stephen: RUSSIA JUST GAVE
THEM NUCLEAR RODS.
>> THOSE NUCLEAR RODS DON'T
MATTER AS MUCH AS SOME OF THE
OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS PROGRAM,
I'M SORRY TO SAY.
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY YOU'RE
WRONG.
HE'S LIKE BEING THE REASONABLE
ONE.
HE'S LIKE SAYING, IT'S LIKE GOOD
COP, BAD COP.
>> WHO?
>> Stephen: OBAMA.
HEY, LET'S JUST DO THESE
SANCTIONS.
YOU DON'T WANT MY BUDDY IN
ISRAEL, BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPER
ANGRY CRAZY JEWS WHO ARE GOING
TO COME AFTER YOU GUYS WITH A
SHARPENED KNIFE.
THEY CUT OFF THE TIPS OF THEIR
OWN PENISES.
IMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO TO
YOURS.
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IS THAT IT?
DON'T MARK ME COME OUT OF THE
DOGHOUSE?
>> YEAH, UH, YEAH.
THAT WAS GOOD.
THE CIRCUMCISION TACTIC IS
SMART.
BUT EVEN SMARTER WOULD BE
ALLOWING THE SANCTIONS REGIME
THE TAKE ITS TOLL ON THE IRANIAN
ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG WE GOT?
HOW LONG WE GOT?
>> WE GOT THE SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE, ROBERT GATES, SAYS
PROBABLY A YEAR.
WE PROBABLY HAVE A YEAR.
SO THIS IS NOT AROUND THE
CORNER, IT'S AROUND THE NEXT
CORNER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NOTHING.
NOTHING.
A YEAR IS NOTHING.
>> IT IS NOT NOTHING.
I MEAN, --
>> Stephen: YOU'RE BENJI
NETANYAHU.
>> BENJI.
>> Stephen: BENJI.
HE'S A FRIEND.
I CAN CALL HIM THAT.
FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
WOULD YOU WAIT A YEAR?
>> IF I'M HIM?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> I WAIT A YEAR.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF HE'S HIM?
>> IF HE'S HIM, HE WAITS A YEAR
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN
SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
IF THIS WAS GOING TO HELP
AMERICAN SECURITY IN THE SHORT
TERM, HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
DONE IT ALREADY, BUT HE DOESN'T
WANT TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN
SECURITY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE WANTS HIS
COUNTRY TO SURVIVE.
THIS JUST HIS THINKING.
HE WANTS HIS COUNTRY TO SURVIVE.
IF HE FEELS HIS COUNTRY'S
SURVIVAL IS IN DOUBT, HE WILL
ACT.
FOR NOW HE'S PUT HIS FAITH IN
BARACK OBAMA AND HE HAS SAID
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS PLAN IN
PLACE AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
TO WORK THIS PLAN.
>> Stephen: SO I'M GUESSING HE
DOESN'T THINK OBAMA IS A MUSLIM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> OBAMA, HE DOES NOT THINK THAT
AND OBAMA IS NOT A MUSLIM.
>> Stephen: WE'LL FIND OUT IN
THE NEXT YEAR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
JEFFREY GOLDBERG, THE ATLANTIC
