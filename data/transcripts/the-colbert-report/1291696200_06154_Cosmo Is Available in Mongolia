NATION, THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY

I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THE COVER
OF THIS WEEK'S "TIME."
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE BUY
THIS MAGAZINE.
GOOD ARTICLE.
I READ IT ON THE INTERNET.
( LAUGHTER ).
BUT THERE IS ONE PUBLICATION OUT
THERE BRAVELY BUCKING THIS
TREND, "COSMOPOLITAN," WHICH AS
OF THIS WEEK IS NOW AVAILABLE IN
MONGOLIA.
FOLKS, THIS IS GREAT NEWS.
NOW THAT MONGOLIAN WOMEN HAVE
"COSMO," THEY'LL FINALLY KNOW
WHICH BODY PART THE FEEL
INSECURE ABOUT.
IT'S THE BEARD.
AND THEY WILL GET TO ENJOY
FEATURES LIKE THIS SEASON'S
HOTTEST UNISECONDS DIDN'T UNISEX
HORSELEATHER JERKINS.
GO FROM STABLE GIRL TO YURT
FLIRT.
AND THIS MONTH'S QUIZ: DOES YOUR
MONOGOL HAVE A HORDE ON THE

AND, OF COURSE, THE PERFECT
MARE'S MILK AND MARMOT DIET TO
GET IN SHAPE FOR BORTGON MALGAI
SEASON.

( LAUGHTER )
NO, NO, I INSIST NOT.
ALL FOR A MERE 7,000 TUGRIKS.
BUT IF YOU SUBSCRIBE, YOU GET

BLADDER PHONE.
FOLKS, "COSMO" HAS DISCOVERED
THE WAY TO SAVE THE PUBLISHING
INDUSTRY -- FIND THE LAST PLACES
ON EARTH THAT DON'T KNOW THE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IS DYING.
"HARPER'S" MAGAZINE COULD DOUBLE
THEIR READERSHIP IF THEY
TARGETED THE NINE-MEMBER PINTUPI
TRIBE OF AUSTRALIA'S GIBSON
DESERT.
AND THE MURZU PEOPLE OF ETHIOPIA
WOULD LOVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO
(CLICK)-LAMOUR MAGAZINE.

COULD SELL THEM.
