FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW--AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU
DO-- YOU KNOW THIS SHOW IS ALLABOUT THE HARD NEWS, AND TONIGHT
THERE IS STREET VIOLENCE IN THEUKRAINE, IN THAILAND, AND
VENEZUELA.
I WILL GET TO ALL OF THOSESTORIES, AS SOON AS I DISCUSS
THIS BREAKING NEWS FROM THEHUFFINGTON POST.
WAS YOUR KID HITLER IN A PASTLIFE?
IT'S THE KIND OF HUFFPO FEATURETHAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION,
"WILL JOURNALISM EXIST IN THEFUTURE LIFE?"
I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED INREINCARNATION.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
MAYBE I WAS A SKEPTIC IN A PASTLIFE.
BUT THIS ARTICLE OFFERSINCONTROVERTIBLE ANECDOTES THAT
YOUR CHILD MAY HAVE HAD A PASTLIFE, SUCH IS THE STORY OF A
SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS ABLE TOTRANSLATE THE WORDS OF ADOLF
HITLER, EVEN THOUGH NONE OF HISRELATIVES KNEW GERMAN.
INCREDIBLE.
EVEN MORE INCREDIBLE THAT HISRELATIVES WHO DIDN'T SPEAK
GERMAN WERE ABLE TO TELL HE WASTRANSLATING CORRECTLY.
LAUGH BUT, FOLKS, JUST BECAUSETHIS KID'S PARENTS BE HE WAS
HITLER IN A PAST LIFE, DOESN'TMEAN YOU SHOULD GIVE UP HOPE FOR
YOUR CHILD.
CONSIDER THIS-- HITLER WAS ANARTIST.
HAS YOUR CHILD EVER COLORED WITHCRAYONS?
( LAUGHTER )DOES HE SOMETIMES HAVE TROUBLE
GETTING ALONG WITH OTHERS?
DOES HE BLAME HIS EARLY BEDTIMEON A GLOBAL JEWISH CONSPIRACY?
IF SO, IF SO-- I WANT TO BECLEAR ABOUT THIS-- IF SO,IM NOT
SAYING YOUR CHILD IS HITLER.
I AM SAYING HE MIGHT HAVE BEENHITLER.
( LAUGHTER )OF COURSE, THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE YOUR KIDS COULD HAVEBEEN, OTHER THAN THE MOST HATED
MAN OF THE 20th CENTURY.
THE ARTICLE POINTS TO OTHERSIGNS OF REINCARNATION TO LOOK
FOR, SUCH AS ADULT-LIKEBEHAVIOR, NIGHT TERRORS, AND
MORBID DRAWINGS THAT RECALLTHEIR PREVIOUS INCARNATION WITH
REALLY MORBID AND BLOODYDRAWINGS.
FOR INSTANCE, MY CHILDHOODDRAWINGS ARE HOW I LEARNED IN A
PAST LIFE I ONCE DEFEATEDGODZILLA BY SHOOTING FLAMES OUT
OF MY BUTT.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, OF COURSE, YOU MIGHT BE
ASKING, "STEPHEN, IS THERE ANYCHANCE THAT THERE ARE FACTUAL
ERRORS IN THIS ARTICLE ABOUT HOWMY CHILD MIGHT BE A REINCARNATED
GENOCIDAL MANIAC?"YES, GREG.
AND I APPLAUD THE HUFFINGTONPOST FOR HAVING THE JOURNALISTIC
INTEGRITY TO PRINT THISCORRECTION.
"AN EARLIER VERSION OF THISSTORY SPELLED ADOLPH HITLER'S
FIRST NAME AS ADOLF."
PHEW!
SPELLED WITH AN "F."
THANK GOD THEY CLEARED THAT UP.
THERE ARE A LOT OF RELIEVEDPARENTS OUT THERE WHO'VE JUST
LEARNED THEIR KID MIGHT NOT BEADOLF HITLER.
HE MIGHT BE ADOLPH HITLER.SLIGHTLY NICER GUY.
