UP NEXT, THERE IS HUGE NEWS
FROM EUROPE.
AT LEAST I THINK IT'S HUGE.
IT'S IN METRIC SO WHO CAN
TELL.
NOW NORMALLY I DO TO THE
GIVE A FLYING PFEFFERNUSSE
WHAT HAPPENS IN ITS OLD
COUNTRY AS LONG AS THEY KEEP
THE AUDIES COMING AND THE
SWISS MISS FLOWINGMENT BUT
EUROPE COULD DRAG US ALL
DOWN JUST LIKE THEY DID TO
DAVID HASSELHOFF.
YOU SEE-- IN THIS NEW GLOBAL
ECONOMY, IN THE GLOBAL
ECONOMY WE'RE ALL
INTERCONNECTED LIKE A FISCAL
HUMAN CENTIPEDE.
AND IF YOU WILL NOTICE, IF
YOU WILL NOTICE AMERICA IS
NOT THE HEAD.
UNFORTUNATELY, CHINA EATS A
LOT OF SPICY FOOD.
SO IT WAS A HUGE RELIEF WHEN
LAST WEEK EUROPE FINALLY GOT
THEIR MERDE IN A PILE.
>> EUROPEAN LEADERS FINALLY
ANNOUNCED SOMETHING
INVESTORS HAD BEEN
WEIGHTSING FOR.
A DEAL TO HELP RECONTAIN ITS
MASSIVE DEBT CRISIS, A
CRISIS THAT THREATENED TO
DERAIL THE ECONOMY AND
RECOVERY HERE IN THE U.S. AS
WELL.
>> Stephen: THE AGREEMENT
WAS REACHED JUST BEFORE 4
A.M. LAST WEDNESDAY.
IMPRESSIVE.
THE BEST PLAN I HAVE EVER
COME UP WITH AT 4 A.M. IS
TELLING THE COPS THAT THE CA
RON STARTED IT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS, THIS CRISIS WAS
OF COURSE CAUSED BY GREECE'S
MASSIVE DEBT.
EVIDENTLY, THEIR ONLY LIQUID
ASSET IS TZAITKI SAUCE.
TO YOU BECAUSE GERMANY HAS
THE LARGEST ECONOMY, THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUTTING
TOGETHER THIS DEAL HAS
FALLEN ON THE SHOULDERS OF
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL IF
ONLY THERE WAS SOMEONE ON
THE WORLD STAGE WHO COULD
RELAX THOSE SHOULDERS.
(LAUGHTER)
NO WAY, OBAMA WOULD DO THAT.
BY THE WAY, THAT IS WHAT A
GERMAN LOOKS LIKE RELAXED.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THIS DEAL--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GERMANY-- GERMANY, HEY,
FOLKS, THIS DEAL FORCES
EUROPEAN BANKS TO TAKE A 50%
LOSS ON ALL THEIR
INVESTMENTS IN GREEK BONDS.
AND THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT.
>> WE'RE GOING DO A 50%
HAIRCUT ON GREEK BOND.
>> A 50% HAIRCUT.
>> BASICALLY THEY'RE BEING
FORCED TO TAKE THIS HAIRCUT.
>> Stephen: AND WE KNOW HOW
HARD IT IS TO GIVE A GREEK A
HAIRCUT.
THE HEDGE TRIMMERS GET DULL
HALFWAY UP THE BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THE PLAN INCLUDES AN
EMERGENCY BAILOUT FUND OF
$1.4 TRILLION.
AND EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE A
SIMPLE WAY TO RAISE THOSE
FUNDS, A STRUCTURED STRATEGY
TO IMPROVE YIELD BY WRITING
DOWN DEBT ON A SLIDING
PERCENTAGE SCALE ENABLING
THE EU TO USE THE PROVEN
FISCAL MODEL OF BEGGING
CHINA FOR $1.4 TRILLION.
IT WORKED FOR US.
NOW EUROPE.
(APPLAUSE)
CHINA, CHINA, VERY
INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE,
TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW EUROPE, IF I MAY, A
LITTLE ADVICE.
WHEN BORROWING FROM THE
CHINESE IT IS POLITE TO SEND
THEM A THANK YOU GIFT.
PERHAPS ALL OF YOUR
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
BUT SO FAR THE CHINESE HAVE
NOT BITTEN ON THIS TURD
PANINI SO AGAIN IT FALLS TO
ME TO AVERT A GLOBAL CRISIS.
TO TEMPT POSSIBLE INVESTORS
I HAVE CREATED THE FOLLOWING
MULTIMEDIA PROSPECTUS WITH
THE GERMAN DELEGATION'S
HANDS BEINHOLTZ.
SO GET OUT YOUR CHECKBOOKS,
WORLD.
>> DO YOU-- INDOORS,
PAINTING ON THE CEILINGS,
PERHAPS YOU LIKE THE LADIES
WITH SOME HAIR IN THE ARMPITS?
I AM GERMAN DIRECTOR GENERAL
OF FINANCE HANS BEINHOLTZ.
THESE ARE DARK FINANCIAL
TIMES.
AND YOU WANT A SECURE PLACE
TO PUT YOUR MONEY.
THAT IS WHY I AM PLEASED TO
OFFER YOU AN AMAZING
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY

WANTED TO OWN A CONTINENT?
MY PEOPLE HAVE.
EUROPE HAS GERMANY, FRANCE,
ITALY, YES, EUROPE, OR THE
OLD COUNTRY, WILL NEVER LOSE
ITS VALUE BECAUSE LEADING
ECONOMIC INDICATOR PROJECT
THAT EUROPE IS INCREASED IN
AGE OVER TIME.
FAKE A NAP 592, MEET YOUR
LOVER AT 4, MEET YOUR
MISTRESS AT 5, MEET YOUR
LOVER'S MISTRESS AT 6, CHEE
CHEE, A THOUSAND OF THE
STRANGEST --

JUST ONE EASY PAYMENT OF
$1.4 TRILLION.

EXIST?
