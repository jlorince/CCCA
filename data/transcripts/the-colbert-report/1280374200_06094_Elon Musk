MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CO-FOUNDER
OF THE ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY
TESLA MOTORS.
I HOPE HE ENJOYED HIS RIDE HERE
IN MY COAL-FIRED ESCALADE TOWN
CAR.
PLEASE WELCOME ELON MUSK.
HEY, MR. MUSK, THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S CHECK THIS OUT.
IT'S PRETTY DAMN IMPRESSIVE.
YOU ARE ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF
PAYPAL, CORRECT?
>> YES.
YES.
>> Stephen: AND YOU ALSO ARE
ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF TESLA
MOTORS, WHICH IS THE BIG, YOU
KNOW, $100,000 RACE CAR WHICH
JUST RUNS ON BATTERIES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND YOU ARE ALSO
ONE OF THE... YOU RUN SPACE X,
WHICH IS THE VERY FIRST PRIVATE
COMPANY, NON-NATION TO BE ABLE
TO PUT SOMETHING INTO ORBIT
AROUND THIS PLANET WE CALL
EARTH.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHERE DO YOU FIND
TIME FOR YOUR SECRET IDENTITY AS
BATTEDMAN?
BECAUSE YOU ARE EITHER A
SUPERHERO OR A SUPER VILLAIN.
WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE, SIR?
>> WELL, I THINK PROBABLY
NEITHER.
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY MOSTLY AN
ENGINEERMENT I DESIGN THINGS.
>> Stephen: OH, YEAH, AN
ENGINEER.
BRUCE WAYNE'S A BANKER.
YEAH.
>> SO I REALLY TRY TO APPLY
EFFORTS TO DESIGNING THINGS I
THINK WILL HAVE A POSITIVE
IMPACT ON THE WORLD.
OBVIOUSLY I THINK ELECTRIC CARS
ARE A WAY TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE
TRANSPORT IN THE FUTURE.
>> OKAY.
YOU HAVE ELECTRIC CARS, TESLA,
WHICH NOW COSTS ABOUT $100,000.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THAT PRICE
DOWN TO WHAT, $99,000?
>> WE HAVE THIS WHICH IS ABOUT
HALF THE PRICE.
AND THEN IN THE THIRD GENERATION
VEHICLE WILL BE MAYBE HALF AGAIN
AS LOW AS THAT.
THAT'S OUR TARGET IN THE LONG
TERM.
IT'S TO MAKE MASS MARKET
ELECTRIC CARS.
>> OKAY.
SO IT WAS NICE OF ME TO HAVE HIM
ON.
NOW, YOU'VE GOT THESE ELECTRIC
CARS, OKAY, THAT DON'T USE
FOSSIL FUELS, BUT THEN YOU'VE
ALSO GOT THIS ROCKET, THIS SPACE
X, WHICH PUTS, YOU KNOW, THE
ROCKET INTO SPACE USING ABOUT AS
MUCH FUEL AS TWO MILLION
HUMMERS.
SO ARE YOU TRYING TO BREAK EVEN
AS SPECTACULARLY AS POSSIBLE?
>> WELL, IT'S TRUE THAT THE
ROCKET DOES USE ESSENTIALLY
REFINED JET FUEL.
IT'S ACTUALLY MOSTLY OXYGEN
BECAUSE IN SPACE YOU HAVE TO
CARRY YOUR OWN OXYGEN.
>> Stephen: OTHERWISE PEOPLE
CAN'T HEAR YOU SCREAM.
>> RIGHT.
BUT IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF
JET FUEL RELATIVE TO WHAT
AIRPLANES USE.
AND IF THERE WERE ANOTHER PATH,
I WOULD CERTAINLY GO THAT PATH.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT, WHAT,
WHAT LEADS YOU FROM PAYPAL TO
TESLA TO SPACE?
YOU'RE THE FUTURE MAN.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE CAN
HAVE PRIVATE SPACE TRAVEL?
HOW FAR BEFORE I CUT A CHECK AND
OFF I GO?
>> WELL, WE DO HOPE TO BE
CARRYING PEOPLE TO THE SPACE
STATION IN PERHAPS AS SOON AS
TWO OR THREE YEARS.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG BEFORE
YOU THEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO
BRING THEM BACK.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOTTEN
IT UP THERE, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
LANDED ONE OF THESE DADDIES.
>> THAT IS EXTRA, FOR SURE.
>> Stephen: SMALL SURCHARGE.
>> MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THAT BOX.
SO WE WANT TO CARRY NASA
ASTRONAUTS AND ALSO CARRY
PRIVATE CITIZENS TO SPACE.
WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CARRY
PEOPLE BEYOND EARTH'S ORBIT.
I REALLY THINK PRIVATE
ENTERPRISE IS THE FUTURE OF
SPACE TRANSPORTATION, JUST AS IT
IS IN AIR TRANSPORT AND ROAD
TRANSPORT AND SHIPS AND THAT
KIND OF THING.
>> Stephen: SO YOU THINK A
BUSINESS VENTURE COULD BE MADE
OF THIS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU LIVE HIGH?
DO YOU LIVE LARGE?
ANSWER THE QUESTION, SIR?
DO YOU LIVE LARGE?
>> I SUPPOSE BY SOME STANDARDS I
DO LIVE LARGE.
>> Stephen: YOU SEEM SLIGHTLY
MORE SUBDUED AND A LITTLE BIT
MORE DOWN-TO-EARTH DIE THAN YOUR
COMPETITOR IN SPACE EXPLORATION,
PRIVATE SPACE EXPLORATION, SIR
RICHARD BRANSON, BECAUSE WE'VE
HAD SIR DICK ON THE SHOW.
WHEN HE LEFT, WE WERE PULLING
NAKED MODELS OUT OF THE COUCH
FOR WEEKS.
DO YOU DO ANY OF THAT STUFF?
>> WELL I...
>> Stephen: IT'S A GREAT
PICKUP LINE, I AM THE ONLY
PERSON TO PUT SOMEONE IN SPACE.
>> HAVE YOU SEEN MY ROCKET.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
BY THE WAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
HIS ROCKET.
JIM.
OH.
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL LAUNCH
THAT PUT YOU GUYS INTO SPACE FOR
THE FIRST TIME, CORRECT?
>> OUR BIG ROCKET IN SPACE, YES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THAT ORBITED THE EARTH FOR HOW
LONG?
>> ABOUT A MONTH.
>> Stephen: LIKE SPUTNIK.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU THE NEXT
ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES?
>> I'M A GREAT FAN OF THE UNITED
STATES, LIKE YOU ARE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: EXCELLENT.
I'LL TELL YOU, WHAT WHEN YOU
FINALLY CAN PUT PEOPLE IN SPACE,
WILL YOU GIVE ME A DISCOUNT FOR
HAVING YOU ON?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ELON
