FOLKS, I NEVER LOOK FOR ERKS
TERNAL VALIDATION, AND FOR THAT
KIND OF CONFIDENCE I SHOULD GET
AN AWARD.
THIS IS WHO'S NOT HONORING ME
NOW.
LAST NIGHT THEY HELD THE ANNUAL
TONY AWARDS, WHICH HONOR
BROADWAY'S GREATEST
ACHIEVEMENTS.
FOR INSTANCE, THE TONYS STILL
AIR ON NETWORK TV, AND FOR THE
64th CONSECUTIVE YEAR, I DID
NOT WIN A TONY.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
[AUDIENCE REACTS AGAIN]
AND I DON'T CARE.
SEE, I CAN ACT.
OF COURSE, ONE OF THE BIG
WINNERS WAS FRIEND OF THE SHOW
"FELA," WHICH WON FOR BEST COG
COG -- CHOREOGRAPHY.
"FELA" NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH
THE OFF, OFF, OFF BROADWAY HIT
"FELLAS," THE SHOW THAT
REDEFINES THE PHRASE, "THERE ARE
NO SMALL PARTS."
UNFORTUNATELY THE TONY AWARDS
ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES NOT
HONORING ME.
MTV GAVE OUT THEIR MOVIE AWARDS,
WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IF
YOU'RE BETWEEN THE AGE 13-S AND
13.5.
IT'S A VARIABLE WHO IS WHO OF
WHO IS IN "TWILIGHT."
I DIDN'T EVEN GET A NOMINATION.
MTV, WHAT ABOUT MY WORK IN "THE
BOUNTY HUNTER."
I WAS IN THE BACK OF THE THEATER
SCREAMING OVER THAT ENTIRE
MOVIE.
WHAT MAYOR MENINO TV DID ME NEXT
SHOCKED ME MORE THAN IF THEY
PLAYED A MUSIC VIDEO.
JIM?
>> THE BIGGEST BAD-ASS STAR
IS... RAIN.
>> STEPHEN: RAAAAAAAAIN!
[APPLAUSE]
YES, RAIN, MY K POP ARCH NEMESIS
MARK WHO TAKES CRUEL PLEASURE IN
BEATING ME AT THINGS, FROM
TIME.COM'S MOST INFLUENTIAL
PERSON OF THE YEAR TO OUTSELLING
MY KOREAN POP SINGLE, "HE'S
SINGING IN KOREAN," TO DEFEATING
ME IN A DANCEOFF ON THE
TECHNICALITY THAT HE'S A MUCH
BETTER DANCER THAN I AM.
AND NOW HE WINS FOR NINJA
ASSASSIN?
CLEARLY HE ONLY WON THE BAD-ASS
AWARD BECAUSE HIS MOVIE HAS THE
WORD "ASS" IN THE TITLE TWICE
AND WAS BAD.
JIMMY, SHOW ME... SHOW ME SOME
OF HIS SUPPOSED NINJA
BAD-ASSEDNESS.
YEAH, IMPRESSIVE, BUT YOU KNOW
WHO YOU DIDN'T SEE IN THAT CLIP?
ME.
WHO IS THE BETTER NINJA NOW?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
RAIN, YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS
ROUND, BUT I AM STILL AHEAD IN
LEXICOGRAPHY.
THIS IS WHO IS HONORING ME NOW.
NATION, ON MY VERY FIRST SHOW, I
INVENTED THE WORD "TRUTHNESS" TO
DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT FEELS
TRUE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IN SOME
STUPID OLD REFERENCE BOOK.
WELL, GUESS WHAT, TRUTHINESS IS
NOW IN SOME STUPID OLD REFERENCE
BOOK.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE THIRD EDITION OF THE NEW
OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY,
WHICH NOT ONLY INCLUDES THE WORD
"TRUTHINESS" WITH MY DEFINITION,
IT SAYS THAT IT WAS COINED IN
THE MODERN SENSE BY ME, STEPHEN
COLBERT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO BIG DEAL.
MY NAME IS IN THE DICTIONARY.
NOW I CAN JUST SIT BACK AND LET
THOSE ROYALTIES ROLL IN.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL IT
"COINING A PHRASE"?
CHA-CHING.
OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY, I AM
SO HONORED THAT I JUST DON'T
HAVE THE WORDS TO THANK YOU,
SOILY GO WITH "COELOCANTH,"
"LUGUBRIOUS" AND "TETHER BALL."
SO TAKE THAT, RAIN.
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REAL
DEFINITION OF BAD ASS, I WILL
READ IT TO YOU.
WHAT THE BAD ASS NOW KOREAN POP
