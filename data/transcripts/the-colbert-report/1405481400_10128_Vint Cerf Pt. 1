>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MYGUEST HELPED CREATE THE
TECHNOLOGY THAT BECAME THEINTERNET. SO HE'S HERE
TO PROMOTE...EVERYTHING? PLEASEWELCOME VINT CERF!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, VINT!
WELL, LISTEN --(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
>> I'M DELIGHTED.
>> Stephen: I'M A HUGE FAN OFYOUR WORK.
YOU WERE CREDITED WITH BEING ONEOF THE CO-FATHERS OF THE
INTERNET.
WHAT DOES CO-FATHER MEAN AND HOWMUCH DID THE INTERNET'S MOTHER
GET AROUND?
(LAUGHTER)BACK IN THE DAY?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE THECO-FATHER OF THE INTERNET?
>> BOB CONN AND I, THE OTHERFATHER OF THE INTERNET, SAT DOWN
IN 1973 AND BEGAN DESIGNING WHATIS NOW THE INTERNET.
THE ORIGINAL PROJECT WAS DONE TOHELP THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT USE
COMPUTERS IN COMMAND ANDCONTROL.
A COMPUTER CAN HELP YOU MANAGERESOURCES BETTER WHICH MIGHT
MEAN THE SMALLER FORCE COULDOVERCOME A LARGER ONE IF THE
SMALLER ONE COULD MANAGE ITSRESOURCES BETTER THAN THE
OPPONENT.
>> Stephen: DID YOU BUILD THESWITCH WHERE THE COMPUTER TURNS
ON AND KILLS ALL OF HUMANITY?
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S THE WAY THE MOVIE GOES.
I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE.
>> THAT WASN'T THE PLAN.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MAKEAS ONE OF THE FATHERS OF THE
INTERNET OF OUR FEAR THECOMPUTERS WILL TAKE OVER AND
MAKE US OBSOLETE?
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANYTHINGTO THAT IDEA?
>> NOT IN THAT FORM.
WHAT I DO THINK, THOUGH, IS WESHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT
COMPUTERS THAT MAKE MISTAKESBECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKES
FASTER THAN WE CAN AND SO THEREIS A BIG ISSUE ABOUT KEEPING THE
COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT SAFE WHICHMEANS WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT WRITING SOFTWARE THATDOESN'T HAVE BUGS.
>> Stephen: IF YOU'RE ONE OFTHE FATHERS OF THE INTERNET, WHY
DID YOU MAKE SO IT DANGEROUS FORUS TO PLAY ON, VINT?
>> WELL, BECAUSE AT THE TIME, WEDIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE
AS POPULAR OR AS BIG AS IT WOULDBE.
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ANEXPERIMENT AND DESIGNED AND USE
FOR MILITARY AND MAYBE ACADEMICPURPOSES BUT IT GOT LOOSE AND
THE EXPERIMENT GOT LOOSE ANDBECAME PART OF THE PUBLIC.
>> Stephen: AGAIN, THAT'S PARTOF THE HORROR MOVIE I'M WRITING.
YOUR EXPERIMENT GOT LOOSE.
WHEN I GO ON, ARE ALL OF US, AREWE STILL PART OF YOUR
EXPERIMENT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
HOW IS THE EXPERIMENT GOING?
>> IT'S ACTUALLY GOING RATHERWELL, TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH
YOU.  ABOUT 3 BILLION PEOPLEARE ONLINE RIGHT NOW AND EVERY
TIME THEY COME UP WITH NEW WAYSOF USING THE INTERNET, WE ALL
LEARN SOMETHING FROM THAT.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THISWHOLE STORY IS THE INTERNET HAS
ALWAYS BEEN VERY OPEN TO PEOPLETRYING OUT NEW IDEAS AND WE NEED
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN ATGOOGLE SINCE 2005.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THEIRINTERNET EVANGELIST.
WHY DOES GOOGLE NEED AN INTERNETEVANGELIST?
AREN'T YOU PREACHING TO THECHOIR?
>> NO.
ACTUALLY, IT TURNS OUT THAT WITHONLY 3 BILLION PEOPLE ONLINE,
THERE'S ANOTHER 4 BILLION TO GO.
I'M THE CHIEF INTERNETEVANGELIST.
>> Stephen: WHO ARE THESE4 BILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT
TO TWEET?
>> IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T WANTTO TWEET, IT'S THAT THEY DON'T
EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNETYET.
>> Stephen: WHERE?
ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUTLARGELY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU TRIEDCARPET BOMBING THEM WITH FREE
AOL CDs?
BECAUSE THAT WORKED IN THE'90s FOR A LONG TIME.
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO HAVESOMETHING TO READ THE CD WITH
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACOMPUTER, YOU KNOW -- THEY HAVE
MOBILE PHONES, THOUGH, AND ITHINK THIS IS IMPORTANT.
THE MOBILE PHONE HAS BECOME THEAVENUE FOR PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS
TO THE INTERNET FOR THE FIRSTTIME.
IT'S QUITE AN AMAZING MARRIAGE.
THE INTERNET WAS FIRST DESIGNEDIN '73.
THE HANDHELD MOBILE WAS DESIGNEDIN '73 BY MARTY COOPER FOR
MOTOROLA AND WE DIDN'T KNOWABOUT EACH OTHER AT ALL TILL
1983 UNTIL WE TURNED THEINTERNET ON, MARTY COOPER TURNED
ON THE FIRST HAND-HELD PHONE, SOTHE TWO TECHNOLOGIES --
>> Stephen: YOU STARTEDWORKING ON THE INTERNET IN 1973
AND YOU TURNED IT ON IN 1983?
>> IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO ACTUALLYTURN THE SYSTEM ON.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS HAPPENINGIN THOSE TEN YEARS?
IF YOU, BOB -- OBVIOUSLY, ALGORE WAS THERE --
(LAUGHTER)>> AL SHOWED UP ABOUT 1986.
>> Stephen: THAT'S STILLPRETTY EARLY.
>> IT'S STILL EARLY ON.
WE TURNED IT ON.
HE HELPED GET IT TO SPREADBECAUSE HE HELPED THE NATIONAL
SCIENCE FOUNDATION FUND THE BIGBACKBONE, PART OF THE INTERNET
THAT LINKED ABOUT 3,000UNIVERSITIES TOGETHER PLUS THE
SUPERCOMPUTERS.
>> Stephen: SO HE DID HELPBUILD THE INTERNET?
>> HE DID HELP.
>> Stephen: YOU JUST TOOK AWAYONE OF MY FAVORITE CUDGELS.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR ASECOND?
WE HAVE TO DO A COMMERCIAL BUT IWANT TO TALK MORE.
WE'LL BE BACK WITH FATHER OF THEINTERNET VINT CERF.
STICK AROUND.
