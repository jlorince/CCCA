(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THIS BEAUTIFUL SPRING DAY.
FOLKS, IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU KNOW IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT THE NEWS SHOCKED ME.
LAST TIME WAS WHEN I WAS WATCHING CNN IN THE TUB WITH THE T.V. BALANCED ON THE EDGE.
(LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN!
PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST RETURNED FROM AN ECONOMIC SUMMIT IN COLOMBIA.
HUGE WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
HE WAS ALREADY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLOMBIA!
SEEMS REDUNDANT.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THERE IS ONLY ONE STORY OUT OF THAT SUMMIT THAT ANYONE IS TALKING ABOUT.
>> I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT THE U.S./COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT ENTER INTO FORCE NEXT MONTH.
>> Stephen: NICE TRY!
NO, JIMMY, I SEEM TO RECALL ANOTHER STORY THAT WAS, SHALL WE SAY, MAS CALIENTE.
>> SEX, SCANDAL AND THE SECRET SERVICE.
>> BEFORE THE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN CARTAGENA, SEVERAL WOMEN-- SOME BELIEVED TO BE PROSTITUTE
WERE BROUGHT TO THIS HOTEL BY SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL.
>> $47 THE AMOUNT A SECRET SERVICE AGENT WOULD NOT PAY A PROSTITUTE.
IT'S BEING CALLED THE WORST SCANDAL IN SECRET SERVICE HISTORY.
>> Stephen: YES, THE WORST.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT STATEMENT IS OVERBLOWN AT ALL.
(LAUGHTER) NATION, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I FEEL SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE HERE.
YOU SEE, THE SECRET SERVICE WAS HERE LAST WEEK TO PROTECT THE FIRST LADY AND, LIKE ANYONE WHO
GETS CLOSE TO MY VIRILITY, THEY OBVIOUSLY GOT THEIR MANHOOD JACKED UP.
IT'S CALLED BEING MAN JACKED.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE SAME TEAM THAT WAS HERE BUT IT
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME A VISITOR TO THIS BUILDING HAD TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL RELIEF AFTER
BEING HERE.
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- ACCORDING TO THE F.B.I.'S PHONE
RECORDS, ELIOT SPITZER CALLED A PROSTITUTE IN THE CAR RIGHT AFTER LEAVING MY STUDIO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I JUST WANT TO STAY BONNIE RAITT, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
(LAUGHTER) FIND A LEGAL OUTLET, HOT YOGA,
WHATEVER YOU GIRLS DO TO BLOW OFF STEAM.
(LAUGHTER) AND CONSERVATIVE JOURNALISTS FOR NEWS MAX RON KESSLER KNOWS WHO'S TO BLAME HERE.
>> IT REALLY IS JUST A SYMPTOM OF THE MANAGEMENT CULTURE ABOUT
HIM, THE PRESIDENT'S SECRET SERVICE, WHICH CONDONES CORNER CUTTING AND LAXNESS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA CONTINUES TO ACT AS IF REALLY NOTHING HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: THIS IS CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT'S FAULT!
WE ALL KNOW IT'S THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT TO PROTECT THE SECRET SERVICE.
(LAUGHTER) WHERE THE HELL WAS HE WHEN THOSE PROSTITUTES CAME AT THEM?
(LAUGHTER) HE SWORE AN OATH!
HE SWORE AN OATH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE NOW NOT ONLY DOES AMERICA OWE BILLIONS TO CHINA,
WE OWE $47 TO A COLOMBIAN PROSTITUTE.
(LAUGHTER)
