EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER
FIGHTER-PILOT WHO DESIGNS
SEMI-AUTONOMOUS FLYING
SURVEILLANCE DRONES AT M.I.T.
BIG DEAL, I CAN PUT TOGETHER AN
IKEA STOOL.
[LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME MISSY CUMMINGS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOOO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CHECK IT OUT.
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU, MISSY.
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN US?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
NICE LANDING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT MISS
CUMMINGS, YOU WERE ONE OF THE
NAVY'S FIRST FEMALE FIGHTER
PILOTS?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE NOW AN
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT THE
M.I.T.'S DIRECTOR OF AYER
NAUGHTICS AND THE DIRECTOR OF
HUMAN AND AUTO IMMEDIATE
CONSIDERATION LAB.
ARE YOU MAKING MAN-MACHINE
HYBRIDS?
WHAT DOES THAT DO?
>> NOT QUITE SO EXOTIC.
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY
EASIER FOR HUMANS TO USE.
>> Stephen: LIKE -- WHAT COULD
BE, YOU KNOW HARDER THAN THIS?
[LAUGHTER]
THIS CAN'T BE EASY.
>> THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ACTUALLY
OFF THE SHELF.
YOU CAN BUY ONE OF THESE
YOURSELF.
WHAT WE'VE DONE THAT IS FAIRLY
NOVEL IN OUR LAB IS WE DESIGNED
A CONTROLLER THAWK MOUNT ON AN
iPHONE, ANDROID,DROID, THAT ALLOWS
ANYONE WITH THREE MINUTES OF
TRAINING TO FLY THOSE AROUND.
>> Stephen: I'LL CALL BS ON
YOU.
YESTERDAY I TRIED TO DO THIS
MYSELF WITH YOUR PHONE OPERATOR.
JIM?
OH.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'RE WELCOME.
NOT EVERYBODY GETS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR VERY
EXPENSIVE TOY DESTROYED BY ME.
WHAT IS THIS GOING TO COST ME?
>> $5,000.
>> Stephen: DO YOU TAKE SUPER
PAC MONEY?
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AM I JUST NOT GOOD?
AM I JUST NOT GOOD?
CAN REALLY ANYBODY DO THIS IN
THREE MINUTES OF TRAINING?
>> WITHIN A 95% CONFIDENCE
INTERVAL.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A FIGHTER PILOT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY OF THESE
DRONES OR DRONES LIKE THIS ARE
BEING DEPLOYED RIGHT NOW ON THE
BATTLEFIELD?
>> THEY ARE NOT OPERATIONAL
RIGHT NEW ON THE BATTLEFIELD.
PART OF THE RESEARCH WE'RE DOING
AT MIT AND OTHER PLACES IS TO
MAKE THEM OPERATIONAL.
HOW CAN WE TAKE THE TECHNOLOGY
AND REPLACE WHAT THEY HAVE IN
THE FIELD RIGHT NOW?
THE IDEA IS THAT THIS LITTLE ONE
TO TWO POUND VEHICLE CAN REPLACE
A 45-POUND -- SORRY A 100 POUND
UNMANNED AIR VEHICLE AND THAT
THE OPERATORS HAVE TO CARRY A
45-POUND COMMUNICATION PACK.
>> Stephen: WHERE COULD THIS
GUY BE OPERATING IT?
>> COULD YOU TAKE IT IN THE PACK
BACKPACK.
INSTEAD OF 100 POUNDS YOU COULD
PUT THIS IN THE AIR.
WE PUT THIS ON THE iPHONE
BECAUSE ARMY PEOPLE ARE ISSUED
SMART PHONES.
WE WANT THEM TO TAKE THE GEAR
THAT THEY HAVE.
>> Stephen: REALLY AN
IPHONE.
HOW IS AT&T'S RECEPTION IN
KANDAHAR?
FIVE BARS?
IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE DRONES
FIGHTING IN LIBYA, RIGHT?
WE HAVE DRONES FIGHTING IN --
THESE ARE LIKE THE UNSUNG HEROES
OF IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND LIBYA
AND THE HEROS FERL -- OF SOME OF
OUR UNSUNG WARS LIKE IN PAKISTAN
AND YEMEN, RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
ARE DRONE PILOTS GOING TO BE
TAKING OVER DOMESTIC FLIGHTS AS
WELL?
I'M IN THE SURE IF I WANT TO
HEAR SOMEONE THIS IS YOUR
CAPTAIN SPEAKING BLEEP, BLORP.
DO I HAVE THAT TO FEAR?
>> MOST COMMERCIAL JETS CAN FLY
ON THEIR OWN RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: THEY CAN?
>> PLANES TAKE OFF EVERY DAY
WITH A PILOT NEVER TOUCHING THE
STICK IN TODAY'S WORLD.
>> Stephen: I AM GOING TO BUY
SOME TRAIN TICKETS.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE COULD BE SEMI AUTO TON
MUSS PLANES OUT THERE?
>> THEY WILL ARE.
THE PILOT IS SITTING THERE
WATCHING AND THE MAKING SURE
EVERYTHING GOES OKAY.
THIS HAPPENS MORE IN EUROPE THAN
IT DOES IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CULTURAL
ISSUE.
WE'RE NOT AS OPEN TO IT AS
POTENTIALLY PEOPLE IN OTHER
COUNTRIES.
>> Stephen: WE'VE BEEN WARNED
BY DOCUMENT RICKS LIKE 2001-A
SPACE ODD I DID THAT THE ROBOTS
WILL RISE UP AGAINST US.
HOW DO I KNOW THIS ROBOT IS R2D2
AND IN THE THE HOW 9000.
BECAUSE IT HAS AMERICAN FLAGS ON
IT.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE SPEAKING
MY LANGUAGE.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO, GO AHEAD.
SAY GOODBYE, EVERYBODY.
YOU MAY BE A MASTER AT HUMAN
MACHINE INTERACTION.
>> I'M READY.
>> Stephen: LET'S SEE WHETHER
YOU CAN BEAT ME AT ROCK 'EM SOCK
'EM ROBOTS.
BEFORE WE GO THANK FOR JOINING
ME.
>> MY PLEASURE.
