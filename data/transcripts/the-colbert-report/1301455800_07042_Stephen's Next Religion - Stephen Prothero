AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
TRY NEXT.
SO HERE TO HELP ME DECIDE YAW
WHICH WAY TO GO IS THE AUTHOR OF
"GOD IS NOT ONE" STEVEN PROTHROE
YOU'RE AN EXPERT.
I WANT TO GET ON BOARD A WINNER,
WHAT'S THE FASTEST GROWING
RELIGION IN THE WORLD.
>> ISLAM IS GROWING FASTEST.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
IT'S GOT KIND OF A P.R.
NIGHTMARE ON ITS HANDS.
(LAUGHTER)
INSTEAD OF FASTEST GROWING, I'M
SURE IT'S A GREAT AND TRUE
RELIGION BLESSINGS AND PEACE BE
UPON THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S JUST GO WITH THE BEST.
WHAT'S THE BEST RELIGION?
>> OH, WOW.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WHAT'S THE
BEST ONE?
>> I'M KIND OF PARTIAL TO THE
QUAKERS.
>> Stephen: THE QUAKERS?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THE OATMEAL
PEOPLE?
REALLY?
THEY'RE THE WINNERS?
QUAKERS.
>> THEY'RE NOT WINNING BUT IT'S
AN INTERESTING RELIGION.
YOU GO TO THE MEETING... INSTEAD
OF CHURCH THEY CALL IT THE
MEETING AND THERE'S NO PRIEST
AND THERE'S NO SACRAMENTS, NONE
OF THEM AT ALL.
AND PEOPLE DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT
ALL IN THE CHURCH.
>> Stephen: NO ONE SAYS
ANYTHING?
>> TOTALLY SILENT.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S LIKE
RIDING A CITY BUS.
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE CITY, BUT
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY.
I'M... QUAKERS APPEAL TO ME.
NIXON WAS A QUAKER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND I INTIME
PARANOIA.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT HOW ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER?
LIKE ONE OF THE BIGGER GREAT
RELIGIONS.
LIKE HINDU IS PRETTY BIG, RIGHT?
>> HINDU SCHISM MAYBE THE THIRD
OR FOURTH LARGEST RELIGION IN
THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: HELP ME OUT WITH
KARMA.
THERE'S REINCORONATION IN
HINDUISM, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
THE CYCLE OF LIFE, DEATH, AND
REBIRTH THAT WE'RE SNUCK IS
DRIVEN BY OUR CAR MICK ACTIONS.
WHEN WE DO GOOD, GOOD THINGS
HAPPEN TO US.
WHEN WE DO BAD, BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO US.
SO THAT TAKES US FROM LIFE TO
LIFE.
YOU MIGHT REB REBORN AS A HUMAN,
A COW DEPENDING ON YOUR KARMA.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: SO IF I'M BAD AS A
HUMAN I MIGHT COME BACK AS
SOMETHING... A LOWER FORM OF
LIFE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO ARE CATS AND
DOGS ALL FORMER MASS MURDERERS
OR SOMETHING?
OR ARE THEY VERY VIRTUOUS SLUGS
WHO ARE WORKING THEIR WAY UP?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WELL, IT COULD BE EITHER.
BUT PROBABLY THEY WERE HUMANS IN
THE PAST LIFE AND THEY DID
SOMETHING TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT
DOWN THE CHAIN AND THEY'RE
WORKING OFF THEIR BAD KARMA AND
THEY'LL BE REBORN AS HUMANS.
>> Stephen: I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF MY CAT IN ITS PAST
LIFE ALSO SHOWED HIS BUTT TO
PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
HE PUTS IT ON MY FACE ALL TIME.
I WANT TO BE A PLAYER.
I WANT TO BE A BIG MOCKER IN MY
NEXT RELIGION.
WHAT'S ONE I KNOW OF THAT'S
SUPER SMALL.
GIVE ME THE TINIEST ONE.
>> WELL, THE JANE TRADITION IS
VERY SMALL.
THAT'S FROM INDIA.
AND THAT'S ALSO...
>> Stephen: I DON'T DO WELL
WITH CURRY.
ANYTHING ELSE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO ARE THE SHAKERS.
>> THE SHAKERS ARE A TRADITION
THAT EMERGES OUT OF NEW ENGLAND
AND THEY HAVE REVELATIONS THAT
COME THROUGH THIS WOMAN NAMED
ANN LEE AND SHE SAYS AMONG OTHER
THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T
SEX WITH ANYONE AT ALL AND THIS
IS A VERY SMALL RELIGION.
>> Stephen: I WOULD IMAGINE
SO!
(LAUGHTER)
UNLESS THEY REPRODUCE THROUGH
FISSION.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I HOPE TO PICK A NEW ONE SOON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
