>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT JUST ANNOUNCED
THE END OF THE IRAQ WAR.
I SAY WE GET THIS GUY TO
AFGHANISTAN.
PLEASE WELCOME RICHARD ENGLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SIR, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> PLEASE SIT DOWN.
>> IT'S A PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: IT'S WONDERFUL.
I'VE HAD YOU ON BEFORE OVER AT
THE KIDS' TABLE OVER HERE.
NOW WE'RE THE BIG BOYS.
>> I GUESS I'VE MOVED UP.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
HAVEN'T WE ALL.
YOU HAVE MOVED UP AND PROVED ON.
SO ARE OUR TROOPS.
YOU REPORTED SOMETHING THE OTHER
DAY THAT MADE A LOT OF NEWS,
THAT IT WAS REPORTED, NOT JUST
WHAT YOU REPORTED.
WE HAVE A CLIP OF IT HERE.
JIM, CAN YOU ROLL FOR THE GOOD
PEOPLE WHAT THIS MAN REPORTED.
>> RICHARD, I UNDERSTAND YOUR
REPORTING OF THIS AT THIS HOUR
TONIGHT CONSTITUTES THE OFFICIAL
PENTAGON ANNOUNCEMENT, CORRECT?
>> YES, IT IS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> CAN I SET THAT UP.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN SET IT UP
AND YOU CAN SET IT OUT.
GIVE US THE CONTEXT FOR WHAT
THAT WAS.
HOW DID YOU GET THAT REPORT?
WHY ARE YOU THE ONE WHO TOLD THE
WORLD THAT OPERATION IRAQI
FREEDOM WAS DONE?
>> OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS.
THE LAST AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS
WERE LEAVING IRAQ.
AND THIS WAS THE LAST COMBAT
BRIGADE.
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM IS A
COMBAT MISSION.
IT BEGAN IN 2003, SHOCK AND AWE,
AND LASTED UNTIL...
>> Stephen: SHOCK AND AWE,
BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
>> WHEN YOU THINK OF COMBAT,
TROOPS, TANKS GOING INTO BATTLE
FORMATION, FALLUJAH.
>> Stephen: ALL OF THAT STUFF.
I REMEMBER.
>> OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM IS A
COMBAT MISSION.
SO WHEN THE LAST COMBAT TROOPS
LEAVE, THE COMBAT MISSION IS
OVER.
>> Stephen: SO IF THE COMBAT
TROOPS ARE GONE, WHAT TROOPS ARE
LEFT, LIKE IMPROV TROOPS?
>> NO, THERE IS A TRAINING
MISSION NOW.
THESE ARE ADVISE AND ASSIST
BRIGADES.
THEY ARE STILL ON.
THEY CAN STILL GET INTO FIGHTS.
>> Stephen: NO MORE BOOTS ON
THE GROUND?
>> THEY'RE IN IRAQ.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
ARE THEY WEARING BOOTS?
>> THEY'RE WEARING BOOTS.
>> Stephen: AND THEY'RE NOT
HOVERING ON BALLOONS?
>> NO, BUT THEY'RE NOT ON A
COMBAT MISSION PER SE.
THESE COMBAT BRIGADES ARE
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED AND
EQUIPPED TO DO OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS, TO SURROUND A TOWN
TO, GO IN, KNOCK DOWN PEOPLE'S
HOUSES OR KNOCK DOWN THE DOORS
AT LEAST, KICKING IN DOORS.
>> Stephen: OR SOMETIMES YOU
JUST BLOW A HOLE IN THE WALL.
>> IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE
OPERATION, BUT THOSE ARE COMBAT
OPERATIONS.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THEM IN
IRAQ.
WITH THE LAST COMBAT BRIGADE
LEAVING, THAT PHASE IS OVER.
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM ENDED
WHEN IRAQI... WHEN AMERICAN
COMBAT TROOPS LEFT.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S IT CALLED
NOW?
IT'S GOT TO HAVE A NAME, RIGHT?
>> YES, OPERATION NEW DAWN.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
ISN'T THAT...
>> THAT MISSION OFFICIALLY
BEGINS ON SEPTEMBER 1st.
THAT'S WHEN THERE WILL BE A
CEREMONY AND NEW DAWN BEGINS AT
NEW DAWN.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THIS TRADING
MISSION WHERE AMERICAN TROOPS
ARE ON THEIR BASES WORKING AS
ADVISERS, HELPING THE IRAQIS
FIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS T PRESIDENT IS
GIVING A SPEECH ON ALL THIS
TUESDAY.
GIVE US A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU
THINK HE'S GOING TO SAY.
>> HE'S GOING TO SAY HE KEPT HIS
PROMISE AND ALL COMBAT TROOPS
ARE OUT BECAUSE THEY HAD UNTIL
THE 31st.
>> I REMEMBER.
THEY TOTALLY JUMPED THE GUN.
>> WELL, THAT'S LOGICAL.
LET'S SAY YOU GAVE ME THE
OPERATION.
RICHARD, I WANT YOU TO REMOVE
THE AUDIENCE.
YOU HAVE UNTIL THE END OF THE
MONTH.
>> Stephen: I WOULD NEVER DO
THAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jerry: MILITARILY SPEAKING,
LET'S SAY YOU SAID, RICHARD,
EVERYONE HAS TO LEAVE THIS
BUILDING BY THE END OF THE
MONTH.
AND THERE'S SOMEONE THAT WANTS
TO DO HARM TO THEM, THERE'S
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO ATTACK YOUR
AUDIENCE.
THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO.
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WAIT UNTIL
THE LAST DAY.
YOU WANT THE KEEP THE ELEMENT OF
SURPRISE.
GOING BACK TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID HE SAY?
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S GOING
TO KEEP HIS PROMISE.
>> Stephen: DID HE?
>> COMBAT TROOPS ARE OUT.
HE CERTAINLY DID.
HE'S GOING TO SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: DUDS HE GET TO
DEFINE WHAT COMBAT TROOP MEANS?
>> WELL, THAT THE COMBAT MISSION
IS OVER.
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM IS OVER
AS HE SAID IT WOULD BE WHEN THE
COMBAT MISSION IS UP.
SO THAT'S PART OF THE SPEECH.
THE OTHER PART OF HIS SPEECH IS
GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT,
WHICH IS GOING TO SAY, THERE'S
STILL A LONG ROAD AHEAD.
THERE ARE A LOT OF BOMBINGS IN
BAGHDAD AND OTHER PARTS.
>> Stephen: JUST THE OTHER DAY
46 PEOPLE DIED.
>> MORE THAN THAT.
ANOTHER SIX WERE KILLED TODAY.
SO HE WILL ALSO HAVE TO SAY,
YES, THE COMBAT MISSION IS OVER,
BUT AMERICA DON'T THINK THAT
IRAQ IS... THAT THE PROBLEM OF
IRAQ IS SOLVED.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT
THERE.
>> I NEVER ANSWERED YOUR
QUESTION.
YOU ASKED ME HOW IS IT THAT I
REPORTED THIS INITIAL REPORT.
HOW DID WE GET TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE DIGGING
INTO THIS RICHARD ENGLE GUY
PRETTY STRONGLY RIGHT HERE.
I'LL LET YOU FINISH THE
QUESTION.
ASK YOURSELF AGAIN.
>> YOU ASKED ME THE QUESTION.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE BACKING ME
UP IN WAYS THAT I NEVER WOULD.
SO HOW DID YOU GET THE SCOOP?
HOW?
>> IT WAS AMAZINGLY EASY AND
THIS IS WHAT'S SHOCKING.
THERE WERE SO MANY REPORTERS
THAT WENT IN AND COVERED IRAQ
WHEN IT FIRST BEGAN, HUNDREDS OF
REPORTERS.
THEY SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO COVER THIS WAR WHEN IT BEGAN.
MOST PEOPLE TURNED DOWN THIS
EVENT.
MOST REPORTERS DIDN'T WANT TO DO
IT.
AND WE JUST HAPPENED TO BE
THERE.
THERE WERE TWO AMERICAN SOLDIERS
STANDING THERE TO SALUTE THE
LAST COMBAT TROOPS AS THEY
CROSSED THE BORDER IN KUWAIT,
AND HANDFUL OF CAMERAS.
WE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THAT LITTLE TRUCK YOU WERE ON AS
YOU WERE DRIVING OUT.
>> VERY COOL PIECE OF EQUIP.
>> Stephen: VERY COOL PIECE OF
EQUIPMENT.
I IMAGINE THEY HAD A
BUMPERSTICKER THAT SAID, "MY
OTHER WAR IS AFGHANISTAN."
LET'S MOVE ON THE AFGHANISTAN
FOR A SECOND, WHICH I'M SURE
SOME OF OUR TROOPS ARE GOING TO
DO, AS WELL.
140,000 PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN
RIGHT NOW, JUST US, NOT EVEN
COALITION.
>> WELL, THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO
GROW.
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE CIRCLE
OF LIFE.
SO IS AFGHANISTAN... THERE IS A
TIMETABLE.
YOU GO TO AFGHANISTAN ALL THE
TIME.
>> ALL THE TIME.
>> Stephen: AFGHANISTAN THE
PRESIDENT ALSO HAS A TIMETABLE
THERE.
THAT'S FOR THE NEXT AUGUST,
RIGHT, A YEAR?
>> BUT THAT'S A MUCH MORE FLUID
TIMETABLE.
THIS TIMETABLE IN IRAQ WAS VERY,
VERY STRICT.
HE SAID AUGUST OF 2011 FOR
AFGHANISTAN.
>> IS THE START OF A DRAWDOWN.
SO THAT'S A MUCH MORE FLUID
THING.
>> Stephen: I'M BEGINNING MY
DIET.
>> I'M BEGINNING MY DIET.
IN IRAQ IT WAS ALL COMBAT TROOPS
HAVE TO BE OUT BY THE END OF
THIS MONTH, AND WE WERE WITH
THEM WHEN THE LAST GUYS LEFT.
HENCE ENDING OPERATION IRAQI
FREEDOM, WHICH HE'S GOING TO
ANNOUNCE ON TUESDAY.
AFGHANISTAN, THE DEADLINE IS A
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
MY LAST QUESTION, RICHARD, IS
WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR OF
OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING THE END OF
THIS INTERVIEW?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
OPERATION COLBERT REPORT IS NOW
OVER.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
