I GOT TO SAY, I GOT TO SAY, I
LOVE THE CHILEAN FLAG.
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING OUR FLAG HAS
BUT CHUNKIER.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU US WITH.
OF COURSE, I'M WAVING THIS THING
AROUND BECAUSE AFTER BEING
TRAPPED FOR 69 DAY, THE CHILEAN
MINERS FROM FINALLY FREE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I WAS ESPECIALLY MOVED
LAST NIGHT WHEN ONE OF THE
MINERS, MARIO SEPULVEDA, GAVE
HIS RESCUERS SOUVENIR ROCKS FROM
THE MINE.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU GOT TO IMAGINE THE GIFT SHOP
DOWN THERE IS PRETTY LIMITED.
BUT IT WAS A TRULY BEAUTIFUL
MOMENT.
I JUST HAVE TO SAY TO THE
CHILEAN MINERS, YOU'RE WELCOME.
AMERICA DID IT.
RIGHT?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
RIGHT, GRETA VAN SUSTEREN.
>> I SUPPOSE IT'S FUN TO POINT
OUT, AT LEAST FOR AMERICA, WE'RE
PART OF THIS.
NASA ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO
DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY TO
HELP THESE.
WE'RE A PART OF THIS.
>> Stephen: WELL, IT'S NO
SURPRISE THAT AMERICA LENT CHILE
A HELPING HANDMENT WE'VE BEEN
HELPING THEM EVER SINCE 1973
WHEN WE ASSASSINATED THEIR
PRESIDENT.
I, OF COURSE, PLAYED A VITAL
ROLE IN THIS RESCUE, AS WELL.
FROM THE MOMENT I FIRST HEARD
ABOUT THOSE MINERS, I'VE BEEN
SAYING, SOMEBODY SHOULD GET THEM
OUT OF THERE.
( LAUGHTER )
CAN'T BELIEVE...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AN I WOULD NOT BE SILENCED ABOUT
IT.
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY
SAID TO ME, SIR, THIS IS NOT THE
CHILEAN, EMBASSY, THIS IS A
CHILI'S.
TO WHICH I SAY, THEN WHERE'S MY
CRISPY ONION STRING AND JALAPENO
STACK?
THE ENTIRE WORLD WATCHED THIS
EVENT.
I FOR ONE DO NOT WANT TO MISS
OUT ON THE TRAPPED MAN EMERGING
FROM A STEEL TUBE CRAZE.
6 8 DAYS AGO I SHOVED ONE OF MY
INTERNS INTO A LONGER AND I
LOWERED HIM INTO A HOLE ACROSS
THE STREET WHERE CON ED HAS BEEN
JACK HAMMERING SINCE THE
EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION.
IT IS TIME TO RESCUE JAY THE
INTERN.
BRING HIM OUT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
[BANGING]
JAY, HOW IS IT IN THERE?
>> DARK.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HERE WE GO, EVERYBODY.
ARE YOU READY FOR THE MIRACLE?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M A HERO!
I'M A HERO!
JAY, ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY?
>> I'M SO HUNGRY.
>> Stephen: ME TOO.
I'LL TAKE A TRIPLE SHOT LATTE
AND A PUMPKIN SCONE.
CHOP, CHOP.
WHY DIDN'T YOUR HAIR GROW OUT?
>> I ATE IT.
>> Stephen: JAY THE INTERN,
EVERYBODY.
CHI, CHI, LAY, CLAY!
CHI, CHI, LAY, LAY!
CHI, CHI, LAY, LAY!
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S NOT TALK
