>> WELCOME BACK, FOLKS.
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, IF YOU CHECKED YOURLITURGICAL CALENDAR YOU'LL KNOW
THAT YESTERDAY WAS EASTER.
SO I JUST WANT TO WISHEVERYBODY A HAPPY EASTER.
BUT NOT FOR YESTERDAY, FORNEXT EASTER, OKAY.
LET ME GET THINGS OUT EARLY.
WHILE I'M AT IT HAPPY LABORDAY, NOW GET BACK TO WORK, IT'S
APRIL. BUT SADLY RECENTPEW RESEARCH FROM THE PEW
RESEARCH CENTER FOUND THATTHE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS
WHO SAY THE SELDOM OR NEVERATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES
HAS RISEN.
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TOCHURCH.
EVIDENTLY, SOMEBODY BLABBEDABOUT THE GOD IS EVERYWHERE
LOOPHOLE.
THANKFULLY, THIS YEAR SOMECHURCHES BEGAN SPENDING
MONEY ON GIVEAWAYS ANDPRIZES IN HOPES OF BOOSTING
ATENDANCE ON EASTER SUNDAY.
AT LAST, PRIZES.
I MEAN WHAT ELSE WERE THEYGOING TO LURE PEOPLE IN W
THE PROMISE OF UNCONDITIONALLOVE AND ETERNAL SALVATION.
THEY GAVE THAT OUT LASTYEAR.
NOW FOLKS, FALLINGATTENDANCE IS WORSE AMONG
MEN, CHRISTIANITY HAS BECOMEUNMANLY.
A LOT OF PRIESTS DON'T EVENHAVE GIRLFRIENDS.
WHICH IS WHY I WAS HAPPY TOHEAR THAT SOME CHURCHES HAVE
FOUND A WAY TO PUT THE DUDEBACK IN DEUTERONOMY,
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORKTIMES", A SMALL BUT GROWING
NUMBER OF EVANGELICALCHURCHES HAVE EMBRACED MIXED
MARTIAL ARTS TO CONVERTYOUNG MEN.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
IT'S LIKE JESUS SAID IFANYONE SLAPS YOU ON THE
RIGHT CHEEK, TURN TO THEMTHE OTHER CHECK THEN KEEP
TURNING UNTIL YOU DELIVER AROUND HOUSE KICK TO HIS JAW.
YAH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YAH!
ALL THIS HARD-CORE MMACHURCH ACTION IS IN A NEW
DOCUMENTARY CALLED FIGHTCHURCH.
>> AS CHRISTIANS, THERE ARETIMES WHERE YOU TAKE SHOTS.
THAT'S WHERE THE BIBLE GIVESYOU YOUR TRAINING.
>> I DON'T LOOK LIKE THETYPICAL PASTOR AND THAT'S
OKAY WITHIN A COUPLE OF GODFEARING MEN PUNCHING EACH
OTHER IN THE FACE.
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,THIS IS PASTOR VERSUS PASTOR.
>> YOU GOT TO LEARN TO PUTYOUR FOOT ON HIS NECK.
SOMEBODY SHOUT JESUS.
>> Stephen: YES, SOMEBODYSHOUT JESUS!
BUT PROBABLY NOT THE GUYWITH THE FOOT ON HIS NECK.
(LAUGHTER)ALL THIS TIME ALL THIS TIME
WE'VE BEEN TURNING TO JESUSFOR ANSWERS TO OUR DEEPEST
QUESTIONS.
BUT WE MISSED THE MOSTCENTRAL QUESTION OF ALL.
>> CAN YOU LOVE YOURNEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF AND
THEN AT THE SAME TIME KNEEHIM IN THE FACE?
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YES, YOU CAN.
ESPECIALLY IF HE KEEPSRAKING HIS LEAVES INTO YOUR
YARD.
THIS IS THE LAST WARNING,ALLEN!
AND REST ASSURED, FOLKS, ALLTHIS FACE KNEEING IS BASED
ON SCRIPTURE.
>> THERE IS A VERSE IN THEBIBLE THAT SAYS BE WARY
WHEN ALL MEN SPEAK WELL OFYOU.
IF EVERYBODY LOVES YOU, YOUARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.
>> Stephen: AND NOTHINGMAKES YOU NOT BE LOVED BY
SOMEONE QUITE LIKESHATTERING HIS CLAVICLE.
WHICH MEANS YOU GOT TO BEDOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAYFIGHT CHURCH IS ABOUT
SPREADING THE WORD.
>> THIS IS A BATTLEFIELD.
WE NEED TO CHARGE HIM, NOTWAIT FOR THEM TO COME TO US.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAYIT'S ABOUT REACHING PEOPLE
WITH THE GOSPEL REGARDLESSOF WHAT YOU DO TO INTRODUCE
THEM TO RELATIONSHIP WITHJESUS CHRIST.
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S ARELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS
CHRIST.
IT'S LIKE A BLIND DATEDURING WHICH YOU MAY BE
BLINDED.
(LAUGHTER)BUT I SAY WE CAN TAKE HAND
TO HAND HOLY WAR EVENFURTHER.
I MEAN IF WATCHING TWOCHRISTIANS ATTACK EACH OTHER
IS FUN WHAT ABOUT A CHRISTIANAND A LION?
(LAUGHTER)WITH ACTION LIKE THAT I BET
YOU COULD FILL UP A STADIUM.WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
