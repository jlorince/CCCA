>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, THE HOLIDAY SEASON ISHERE, AND WHETHER YOU CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS, HANUKKAH, KWANZAA, ORLET'S BE SERIOUS, CHRISTMAS,
IT'S A VERY STRESSFUL TIME OFYEAR FOR US WEALTH-MERICANS.
IT'S SO HARD TO FIND THE PERFECTPRESENT.
FOR MY HIGH-NET-WORK VIEWERS I'MSANTA'S LITTLE HELPER.
THIS IS "COLBERT PLATINUM."
♪  ♪( APPLAUSE )
HOLIDAY GIFT EDITION.
REMEMBER, THIS SEGMENT IS FORPLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY.
SO IF YOU HAD TO BLEACH YOURREGULAR TIGER TO GET IT WHITE,
WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG AND BUYSOME SWEAT PANTS WITH WORDS ON
THE BUTT.
THEY'RE PROBABLY GONE BY NOW.
FOLKS, THE HOLIDAYS ARE ALLABOUT FAMILY, AND THERE'S NO
BETTER GIFT FOR YOUR FAMILY THANDONATING MONEY TO GET YOUR
FAMILY NAME ON AS MANY THINGS ASPOSSIBLE.
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GIVE TOYOUR COMMUNITY A SENSE OF JUST
HOW RICH YOU ARE.
JUST ASK BILLIONAIREINDUSTRIALIST DAVID H. KOCH.
HE'S GOT THE DAVID H. KOCHPLAZA
AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM.
THE DAVID H. KOCH BALLETTHEATER, AND THE NATURAL
HISTORY MUSEUM'S DAVID H. KOCHDINOSAUR WING.
THE "H,," OF COURSE, IS FORHUMBLE.
AND GETTING YOUR NAME PLASTEREDEVERYWHERE IS THE CLOSEST WE CAN
COME TO IMMORTALITY.
BUT AS ONE PLATINUM FAMILYRECENTLY LEARNED, IMMORTALITY
DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.
>> IF YOU'RE A FAN OF AVERYFISHER HALL AT LINCOLN CENTER,
GET READY FOR THE SOUND OF A NEWNAME.
THE CONCERT SPACE WILL UNDERGOMAJOR RENOVATIONS COSTING A HALF
BILLION DOLLARS.
MAJOR DONORS WILL HAVE TO BECOURTED TO PAY FOR IT, AND THAT
WOULD INCLUDE NAMING RIGHTS.
THE LINCOLN CENTER IS PAYINGAVERY FISHER'S CHILDREN $15
MILLION TO DROP HIS NAME.
>> Stephen:  THEY GAVE UP THENAMING RIGHTS TO AVERY FISHER
HALL FOR A LOUSY $15 MILLION?
FOR THAT KIND OF CHUMP CHANGEYOU CAN'T GET THE NAMING RIGHTS
TO DARYL HALL.
FOLKS, THE LESSON I TAKE FROMTHIS IS THAT SOMEBODY OUT THERE
CAN MAKE A TON OF MONEY BYSELLING THE NAMING RIGHTS.
AND PLATINUM DADDY WANTS IN ONTHIS ONE.
( LAUGHTER )SO WITH JUST TWO DAYS LEFT-- AND
THIS IS TRUE-- I SOLD THE NAMINGRIGHTS TO MY SHOW TO DEWAR'S
SCOTCH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YES.
NOW CALLED STEPHEN CAN THE THECOLB-DEWAR'S REPEWARS."
♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK.
♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK,DRINK
DRINK, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK.
♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK DEWAR'SRESPONSIBLY ♪♪
♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK DEWAR'SRESPONSIBLY ♪♪
THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH SOMECASH.
HEY, HERE'S A FUN LITTLE PARTYGAME-- DRINK DEWAR'S EVERY TIME
YOU HEAR THE WORD "DRINK."
FOLKS, I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS ANEASY DECISION TO GO WITH
DEWAR'S.
ONE, THEIR CHECK CLEARED.
WELL, THAT'S IT, FOR THELAST-EVER EDITION OF "COLBERT
PLATINUM."
( APPLAUSE )SO GOOD-BYE TO MY
"HIGH-NET-WORTH VIEWERS.
I'LL SEE YOU WHEN THEY LINE USUP AGAINST THE WALL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
