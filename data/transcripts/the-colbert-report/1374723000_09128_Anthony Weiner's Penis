MEANWHILE, ANTHONY WEINER'S
PENIS.
YES, I KEPT THAT IN AS LONG AS I
COULD.
JUST LIKE ANTHONY WEANER.
YES, NEW YORK, NEW YORK, THE
CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS JUST GOT
ONE MORE THING TO KEEP IT UP AT
NIGHT BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE
THINKABLE HAPPENED.
>> JIM?
TWO YEARS AFTER A TAWD SEXING
SCANDAL CHASED HIM FROM
CONGRESS, ANTHONY WEINER IS
BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS AGAIN.
TURNS OUT HE CONTINUED SENDING
LEWD MESSAGES AND PHOTOS TO AT
LEAST ONE WOMAN EVEN AFTER HE
WAS FORCED TO RESIGN FROM
CONGRESS
>> Stephen: YES, EVEN AFTER THE
SEXT-ING SCANDAL THAT ENDED HIS
CONGRESSIONAL CAREER.
IT TURNS OUT HE LEARNED NOTHING.
HAS THIS MAN NEVER HEARD OF
SNAPCHAT?
YOUR DONG SHOTS DISAPPEAR
SECONDS AFTER YOU SEND THEM.
I HAVE BEEN TOLD.
ANYWAY, HERE'S BASICALLY WHAT
HAPPENED.
50 DAYS BEFORE THE MAYORAL
PRIMARY, NEW SEXY TEXTS AND
PHOTOS OF THE CANDIDATE WERE
PUBLISHED ON THE WEBSITE, "THE
DIRTY."
THE DIRTY, OF COURSE, THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" OF CELEBRITY SCHLONG
PHOTOS.
THEIR MOTTO: ALL THE DICKS THAT
FIT TO PIC.
NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I
WANT YOU TO BRACE YOURSELF.
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU ONE OF THE
PICTURES.
WARNING: IF THERE ARE CHILDREN
IN THE ROOM, YOU'RE GOING TO
WISH THERE WEREN'T.
JIM JIM?
OKAY.
OKAY, EVERYBODY BREATHE.
LOOKS LIKE HE GOT IT CAUGHT IN A
WAFFLE IRON.
A SERIES OF PAINT SWATCHES.
THAT LAST COLOR IS CALLED PUBLIC
HUMILIATION.
JIM, JIM, CAN WE MOVE ON,
PLEASE?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW, IN RESPONSE, YESTERDAY
WEINER HELD AN EMERGENCY PRESS
CONFERENCE.
>> I HAVE SAID THAT OTHER SEX
TINGE PHOTOS WERE LIKELY TO COME
OUT.
TODAY THEY HAVE.
THE BEHAVIORS ARE BEHIND ME.
I'M BLEESED AND BLESSED THAT MY
WIFE HUMAHAS GIVEN ME A SECOND
CHANCE
>> Stephen: HE'S ALSO BLESSED
THAT SHE'S STILL COUNTING THIS
AS THE SECOND CHANCE.
SHE IS EITHER VERY FORGIVING OR
TERRIBLE AT MATHMENT EITHER WAY,
AT LEAST HE'S TAKING PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
>> MY WIFE AND I, AS I HAVE
SAID, ARE MOVING FORWARD
TOGETHER.
MY WIFE AND I, WE WENT THROUGH
THIS PROCESS.
WE PUT IT BEHIND US.
WE'RE IN A LOT BETTER PLACE
TODAY.
WE KNEW, WE DECIDED, WE, WE, WE,
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD
WORKED THROUGH TOGETHER
>> Stephen: YES, TOGETHER BOTH
HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE WORKED
THROUGH THEIR MUTUAL ROLES IN
HIS SECRETLY SENDING WOMEN
PICTURES OF HIS CRANK.
BY THE WAY...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TWO-WAY STREET.
BY THE WAY, ALL THIS
CYBER-FLASHING HAPPENED JUST
LAST SUMMER.
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS TELLING
PEOPLE MAGAZINE "I FEEL LIKE A
DIFFERENT PERSON."
TURNS OUT IT WAS TRUE.
HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON
BECAUSE HE SENT THESE PENIS
SHOTS OR "DICTURES," UNDER THE
SCREEN NAME CARLOS DANGER.
NOW, I ASSUME...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
VERY DISTINGUISHED.
I ASSUME IT WAS TO AVOID USING A
RIDICULOUS NAME LIKE ANTHONY
WEINER.
AND, FOLKS, I FOUND HIS
REASSURANCES ONLY MORE ALARMING.
>> THIS IS ENTIRELY BEHIND ME.
IT'S IN OUR REAR VIEW MIRROR.
>> Stephen: DEAR, GOD.
IF THAT'S IN OUR REAR VIEW
MIRROR, OBJECT MAY BE CLOSER
THAN IT APPEARS.
BUT FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS PHOTO IS
ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
WELL, AND SOME OF THE SHAFT.
BECAUSE WEINER ALSO SENT HIS
INTERNET CHAT-CHICA LEWD TEXT
MESSAGES AND I WOULD NOT BE
DOING MY JOB AS A JOURNALIST IF
I DID NOT READ THEM ALLOWED ON
NATIONAL TV.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT'S ALL HERE IN THE NEW YORK
POST WHERE I READ ALL MY
PRINTED-OUT INTERNET.
THEY'VE... YOU CAN SEE THEY
BLANKD OUT SOME OF THE WORDS
HERE.
SOME OF THE NAUGHTY BITS ARE
BLANKED OUT.
BUT I'M SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS THERE.
OKAY.
"SO, I WALK INTO A HOTEL ROOM
AND YOU ARE AT THE END OF THE
BED NAKED EXCEPT FOR SOME
AMAZING BLANK-ME SHOES.
HMMMM.
"RESPECT-ME" SHOES.
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'M WRONG.
YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE SURE, I
THINK THE FULL TEXTS ARE ONLINE.
LET ME JUST SEE.
OKAY.
LET'S GO TO "THE DIRTY.
I WANT TO SAY DOT-GOV AT THIS
POINT.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.
OKAY.
HE WRITES "STILL HOLDING YOUR
HAIR.
I SPREAD YOUR LEGS, YOUR...
OH.
(MUMBLING) OH, "YOUR..." OH.
OKAY.
HE TAKE OUT MY... OH, NO.
I LEAN OVER AND... PLEASE.
NO.
[BLEEP].
OKAY.
I BEND DOWN, GRAB THE...
EWW.
I PUT MY TONGUE DEEP IN YOUR
MOUTH.
YOU GRAB MY...
OOF.
OH, MY GOD.
LET ME SEE.
WILL YOU LET ME HOLD YOUR HAIR
WHILE YOU GAG...
JESUS CHRIST.
OH, NO.
OH, NO.
