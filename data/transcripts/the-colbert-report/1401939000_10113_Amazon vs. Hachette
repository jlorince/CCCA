(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> NATION, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A HUGE FAN OF AMAZON.
ITS HE THE ONLY PLACE YOUCAN GET ALL YOUR SHOPPING
DONE IN YOUR UNDERWEAR, ATLEAST SINCE THEY
CLOSED CIRCUITCITY. AMAZON SELLS
EVERYTHING, A SCOOBY DOOCHEST SET, A NEON FULL BODY
LYKRA SUIT, A SAMPLER PACK OFKANGAROO JERKY,
A SHED TO HIDE YOUR DISTURBINGAMAZON
PURCHASES FROM YOUR FAMILY.
BUT NOW I'M NOT JUST MAD ATAMAZON, I'M MAD PRIME.
BECAUSE I JUST FOUND OUTTHAT THEY ARE DETERRING
CUSTOMERS FROM BUYING BOOKSBY STEPHEN COLBERT.
AND AS ANY LONG TIME VIEWEROF THIS SHOW KNOWS, THAT'S ME.
THEY'RE FIGHTING WITH MYPUBLISHER HACHETTE AND AMAZON IS
PLAYING HARD COVER.
>> AMAZON SEEMS TO BESTEPPING UP ITS BATTLE WITH
BOOK PUBLISHER HACHETTE,NOW REFUSING ORDERS FOR SOME
UPCOMING HACHETTE BOOKS.
>> AMAZON HAS BEEN ACCUSEDOF USING DIFFERENT TACTICS
TO QUIETLY DETER PUBLISHESFROM BUYING BOOKS FROM
HACHETTE.
>> AMAZON HAS BEEN ACCUSEDFROM RAISING PRICES TO
DELIBERATELY DELAYINGSHIPMENTS.
>> DELAYING SHIPMENTS.
SOMETIMES THREE TO FOURWEEKS.
FOLKS, THAT IS JUST CRUEL.
IF YOU ORDERED HACHETTE'S 21DAY WEIGHT LOSS BY THE TIME
IT ARRIVES, YOU'RE STILLFAT.
(LAUGHTER)AND THIS IS A BIG
BLOW-- IT'S A BIG BLOW TO MYBOTTOM LINE.
BECAUSE AMAZON CONTROLSAROUND 50% OF ALL BOOK
SALES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
30 BOOKS A YEAR!
(LAUGHTER)AMAZON EVEN RELEASED A
STATEMENT ENCOURAGINGCUSTOMERS TO BUY USED COPIES
OF HACHETTE BOOKS FROM OTHERSELLERS.
FOLKS, PUBLISHERS ANDAUTHORS GET NO CASH FROM
USED BOOK SALES.
PLUS, YOU DON'T WANT THEM.
(LAUGHTER)USED BOOKS ARE THE SLUTS OF THE
LITERARY WORLD, PASSED AROUND FROM PERSON TO PERSON,
SPREADING THEIR PAGES FORANYONE, GETTING CHEAPER AND
CHEAPER UNTIL EVENTUALLYTHEY END UP IN PRISON.
(LAUGHTER)AND I AM NOT THE ONLY VICTIM
HERE.
TAKE HARRY POTTER AUTHOR JKROWLING.
AMAZON HAS TAKEN THEPREORDER BUTTONS OFF HER NEW
HACHETTE BOOK THE SILKWORM,A VICIOUS TACTIC BY AMAZON'S
C.E.O. JEFF BEZOS, OR SHOULDI SAY LORD BEZO-MORT.
AND THIS-- THIS HAS PUSHEDME PAST MY TIPPING POINT.
I THINK.
BECAUSE I'M STILL WAITINGFOR MY COPY OF HACHETTE
AUTHOR MALCOLM GLADWELL'S NOVELTHE TIPPING POINT.
I TELL YOU WHAT, AMAZON, IHAVE GOT A LITTLE PACKAGE
FOR YOU RIGHT HERE, OKAY.
THIS PACKAGE IS CARE OF ME,JK ROWLING AND EXPLAINO THE
CLOWN HERE, OKAY.
