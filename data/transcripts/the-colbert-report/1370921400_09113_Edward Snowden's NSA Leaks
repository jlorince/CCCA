( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
SIT DOWN, NATION.
NATION, I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.
FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO HUG YOUR
DOORS AND LOCK YOUR LOVED ONES
BECAUSE AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK
BY KNOWLEDGE.
WE NOW KNOW THAT THE N.S.A. IS
MIGHT BE SPYING ON US.
AND WE WILL HAVE FULL ME
COVERAGE ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THAT TOMORROW.
BUT TONIGHT WE FOCUS ON THE
LEAKER.
BEHOLD THE FACE OF EVIL.
HIS NAME IS EDWARD SNOWDEN, AND
HE'S AN EMPLOYEE OF DEFENSE
CONTRACTOR BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON
NAMEDDED, OF COURSE, AFTER OUR
DRUNKEST FOUNDING FATHER.
NOW, SNOWDEN HAS FLED TO A HONG
KONG HOTEL ROOM WHERE THE
MINIBAR HAS BEEN STOCKED WITH
"NOT POISON BRAND ACTUAL BEER."
YESTERDAY SNOWDEN SAT DOWN WITH
JOURNALIST GLEN GREENWALD TO
EXPLAIN HIMSELF.
>> I'VE BEEN A SYSTEMS ENGINEER,
SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR, SENIOR
ADVISOR FOR THE CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, SOLUTIONS
CONSULTANT AND A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION
SYSTEMS OFFICER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S SMART.
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR RESUME OUT
THERE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE
ABOUT TO GET A PINK SLIP FROM
THE SKY.
AND AFTER ADDING THAT HE SPEAKS
FRENCH AND CAN USE POWERPOINT,
SNOWDEN WENT INTO DETAIL ABOUT
THE N.S.A.'S EAVESDROPPING
PROGRAM.
>> THE N.S.A. SPECIFICALLY
TARGETS THE COMMUNICATIONS OF
ANYONE.
ANY ANALYST AT ANY TIME CAN
TARGET ANYONE.
SITTING AT MY DESK I CERTAINLY
HAD THE AUTHORITY TO WIRE TAP
ANYONE FROM YOU OR YOUR
ACCOUNTANT TO A FEDERAL JUDGE TO
EVEN THE PRESIDENT IF I HAD A
PERSONAL EMAIL.
>> Stephen: HOW HARD IS THAT?
DURING THE ELECTION I GOT EMAILS
FROM HIM FIVE TIMES A DAY.
FOLKS, SNOWDEN'S GOT THE PROGRAM
ALL WRONG.
ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR OF
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (CLAPS
TWICE) OOPS, SORRY.
SORRY.
(CLAPS TWICE) JAMES CLAPPER.
CLAPPER ASSURES US THE
EAVESDROPPING PROGRAM CANNOT BE
USED TO INTENTIONALLY TARGET ANY
U.S. CITIZEN.
JUST LIKE THE ACUVIBE SOFT TOUCH
PERSONAL MASSAGER IS FOR NECK
CRAMPS AND CANNOT BE USED TO
INTENTIONALLY TARGET ANYWHERE
ELSE.
OKAY?
THAT YOU CAN'T DO.
THAT IS UNDER PENALTY OF WOW.
FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU, I MIGHT BE
THE ONLY ONE SAYING THIS BUT I
THINK I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING
ON HERE.
THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT SNOWDEN
HAD A VERY COMFORTABLE LIFE THAT
INCLUDED A SALARY OF ROUGHLY
$200,000 AND A GIRLFRIEND WITH
WHOM HE SHARED A HOME IN HAWAII.
NATION, I THINK THIS COULD BE
THE MOST PASSIVE AGGRESSIONIVE
BREAK-UP IN HISTORY.
"HONEY, OF COURSE I'M INTO YOU.
YES, I WANT CHILDREN.
BUT FIRST I JUST HAVE TO LEAK A
LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
N.S.A. AND HIDE OUT IN ASIA FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT US.
I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I'M SURE
I WON'T BE MURDERED BY THE HONG
KONG TRIADS."
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY
TOMORROW.
THOUGH ONE LAST THING ON THIS.
I DO FIND IT SUSPICIOUS THAT THE
SAME DAY THIS GUY FLEES TO HONG
KONG, THIS GUY FLEES TO JORDAN.
TO DIRECT A "SERIOUS MOVIE?"
YEAH, THAT'S BELIEVABLE.
AND DIG IT.
WHO'S HIS REPLACEMENT?
A FOREIGNER.
N.S.A., YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS GUY
BECAUSE HE IS SUSPICIOUS AND
