[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, FOLKS, IF YOU'VE BEENWATCHING THE SHOW FOR THE PAST
EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS, YOU KNOWTHERE IS ONE MORAL EVIL I'VE
CRUSADED AGAINST SINCE THIS SHOWBEGAN.
IT'S BOW TIE PASTA.
ALSO GAY MARRIAGE.
BUT DESPITE MY FIRM BELIEF THATMARRIAGE IS MEANT TO BE BETWEEN
ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN, SUPPORT FORSAME-SEX MARRIAGE HAS SPREAD
LIKE DYSENTERY THROUGH A CRUISESHIP.
JIM?
>> A NEW GALLUP POLL FINDSSUPPORT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY
HAS HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.
55% OF AMERICANS NOW SAYSAME-SEX
MARRIAGE MARRIAGES SHOULD BELEGALLY VALID WITH THE SAME
RIGHTS AS TRADITIONAL MARRIAGES.
>> LET'S LOOK HOW QUICKLYATTITUDES CHANGE.
IN 2004, AN ABC/"WASHINGTONPOST" POLL FOUND GAY MARRIAGE
WAS OPPOSED BY 59% OF AMERICANS.
JUST TEN YEARS LATER, SUPPORTEDBY 59%.
GAY ICON JOHN STOSSEL ISRIGHT.
EVER SINCE THE SUPREME COURTRULED THAT THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT WASUNCONSTITUTIONAL, MORE AND MORE
STATES HAVE RUN THEIR OWNSAME-SEX BANS THROUGH THE
GRINDER.
[LAUGHTER]GAY PEOPLE ARE WINNING THIS WAR,
FOLKS.
AT LAST COUNT GAY MARRIAGES ARENOW FULLY RECOGNIZED IN 19
STATES AND THE DISTRICT OFCOLUMBIA.
SO A WARNING TO ALL THOSECONGRESSMEN WHO SHARE AN
APARTMENT TO HELP SAVE MONEY.
YOU ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE OFA COMMON LAW GAY FLOPHOUSE.
AND THE LATEST STATE TO GETTRAMPLED BY THE GAY PRIDE
PARADE, WISCONSIN.
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO FEDERALJUDGE OVERTURNED THE STATE'S BAN
ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
NOT SURPRISING.
I MEAN, THAT WHOLE STATE ISLITERALLY A SAUSAGE-FEST.
THANKFULLY, WISCONSINCONSERVATIVES ARE FIGHTING BACK.
>> WEDDING BELLS WILL NOT BERINGING JUST YET FOR SAME-SEX
COUPLES IN WISCONSIN.
>> THE SAME JUDGE WHO JUST LASTWEEK OVERTURNED THE STATE'S BAN
ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE NOW SAYSCOUPLES WILL HAVE TO WAIT WHILE
THE STATE'S ATTORNEY GENERALAPPEALS THE RULING.
>> Stephen: YES, OVER 550SAME-SEX COUPLES WITH MARRIAGE
LICENSES ARE STUCK IN LEGALLIMBO, WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO
THE NAME OF ONE OF THEIR BARS,BUT IT MAY BE LOSING FIGHT,
FOLKS, BECAUSE THERE ARE HINTSTHAT WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SCOTTWALKER IS RECONSIDERING HIS
STANCE ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
>> GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, WHOHAS GONE ON RECORD OPPOSING
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, SAID SINCETHE BAN WAS LIFTED, HIS
OPINION ON THE ISSUE NO LONGERMATTERS.
>> IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHATI THINK NOW.
>> ARE YOU RETHINKING YOURPOSITION ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE?
>> NO I'M JUST NOT STATING ONEAT ALL.
>> Stephen: YES.
HE'S JUST NOT STATING ONE ATALL.
AND I BELIEVE WE MUST ALLRESPECT WALKER'S PRIVACY AT THIS
DIFFICULT TIME TO BE AGAINST GAYMARRIAGE.
THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTERBETWEEN HIM AND HIS POLLSTER.
IT IS NONE OF THE PUBLIC'SBUSINESS WHAT WALKER DECIDES IN
THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWNGOVERNOR'S MANSION.
IN FACT, I TOO HAVE FELT THECHANGING TIDES AND SO TONIGHT IN
SOLIDARITY WITH SCOTT WALKER, ISTEPHEN COLBERT AM OFFICIALLY
TAKING NO STAND ON GAY MARRIAGE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WHERE DO I FIND THE
INDIFFERENCE?
YES, I MAY HAVE SOME SAID SOMECRISP THINGS ABOUT IT IN THE
PAST, LIKE 90 SECONDS AGO, BUT IHAVE TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT PUBLIC
OPINION, AND I'VE DECIDED TO SETTHE RECORD STRAIGHT... OR GAY.
IT MAY OR MAY NOT MATTER TO ME.
THE POINT IS I AM PASSIONATEABOUT MY UNWILLINGNESS TO
EXPRESS OR EVEN SAY THE WORDS.
OF MY OPINION.
THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS I'MHERE, THEY'RE QUEER, LET'S TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
WHEN WE RETURN,I WILL TALK ABOUTTHE VERY SAME THING WITH MY
GUESTS DAVID BOIES AND TEDOLSON.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
