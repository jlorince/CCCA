FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,BUT TONIGHT I FEEL TEN YEARS
YOUNGER.
IT MIGHT BE THE SUMMER SUN ORTHE SMELL OF BARBECUE OR THE
CHAOS IN IRAQ.
[LAUGHTER]JIM?
>> MILITANTS ON THE MOVE IN IRAQCONQUERING CITY AFTER CITY.
>> THEY'VE NOW TAKEN MOSUL,IRAQ'S SECOND LARGEST CITY,
TIKRIT, SADDAM HUSSEIN'SHOMETOWN, BAIJI, AN IRAQI OIL
REFINERY TOWN, AND TODAY THEYARE TAKING DIRECT AIM AT
BAGHDAD.
>> THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT ANDMILITARY IS LITERALLY
DISINTEGRATING BEFORE OUR EYES.
>> THE SITUATION IS GROWING MOREURGENT AS AMERICAN CONTRACTORS
ARE FORCED TO EVACUATE ANDMILITANTS CONTINUE THEIR MARCH
TOWARDS BAGHDAD.
>> HAPPENING NOW, IRAQ 2.0.
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S IRAQ2.0, AND LIKE ANY UPGRADE, IT'S
FASTER, ONCE IN A WHILEEVERYTHING CRASHES, AND YOU GET
THE ERROR MESSAGE: 404GOVERNMENT NOT FOUND.
[APPLAUSE]BECAUSE, FOLKS, THE NEWS IS IRAQ
IS BEING RAPIDLY OVERRUN BY ATERRORIST GROUP OUT OF SYRIA
ISIS, THE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQAND SYRIA.
THESE ARE SOME BAD HOMBRES.
ISIS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED ASBETTER ARMS THAN THE NATIONAL
ARMIES OF SYRIA AND IRAQ, PARTLYBECAUSE IRAQI SOLDIERS ARE
HANDING OVER THEIR WEAPONS ANDUNIFORMS PEACEFULLY.
IT'S NO SURPRISE IRAQI SOLDIERSARE SHI'ITING THE BED HERE.
JIM?
>> WE'VE ALREADY SEEN JUST HOWRUTHLESS THEY ARE.
THE MILITANTS CLAIM THEY HAVEKILLED 1,700 IRAQIS IN JUST THE
LAST DAY.
>> THEY'RE BRUTAL.
>> VERY RADICAL, VERY MILITANT,VERY DRACONIAN.
HOW DRACONIAN?
THEY'VE BEEN ANNOUNCED BY SUCHINTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS
AS AL QAEDA, WHO HAS NOWOFFICIALLY CHANGED THEIR MOTTO
TO "DEATH TO THE INFIDELS, BUT,YOU KNOW, TASTEFUL."
SO WHO HAS GOT THE BALLS ANDHIS ENEMY'S BALLS TO MAKE AL
QAEDA SEEM KIND OF CHILL?
IT'S NONE OTHER THAN ABU BAKRAL-BAGHDADI, A SHADOWY FIGURE
KNOWN AS THE INVISIBLE SHEIKHSEEN HERE BEING VISIBLE.
[LAUGHTER]AL-BAGHDADI HAS A GROWING ARMY,
RECRUITING FIGHTERS FROM OTHERMILITANT GROUPS BY OFFERING TO
TRIPLE THEIR SALARIES UP TO $400A MONTH.
$400 A MONTH!
BAGHDADI BETTER BE READY FOR AFLOOD OF RESUMES FROM RECENT
COMP LIT GRADS AND SOON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]AND SOON IT MIGHT BE BONUS
SEASON.
>> THE MILITANTS ARE FLUSH WITHCASH.
THEY ROBBED MOSUL'S CENTRALBANK, TAKING OVER $400 MILLION,
ACCORDING TO THE CITY'SGOVERNOR.
>> THEY ARE CONSIDERED NOW THERICHEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
IN THE WORLD, VALUED AT $2BILLION.
>> Stephen: THE RICHESTTERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN THE
WORLD, WHICH MEANS THEY CAN NOWAFFORD MONOGRAMMED SUICIDE
VESTS.
[LAUGHTER]AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVERYTHING
IN AL-BAGHDADI'S AL-BAG OFTRICKS, AS HIS FIGHTERS CLAIM
THAT BAGHDADI HAS PLENTY OFHIDDEN SURPRISES FOR HIS
ENEMIES.
SO A WARNING TO ALL IRAQIS, NOMATTER HOW HUNGRY YOU ARE, NO
MATTER HOW DELICIOUS IT LOOKS,DO NOT OPEN THAT CAN OF PEANUT
BRITTLE.
WORSE, AL-BAGHDADI IS PLANNINGTO SOMETHING AMERICA COULD NEVER
DO IN IRAQ, NATION-BUILD.
>> ISIS'S MAIN AIM IS TO EXTENDAN ISLAMIC CALIPHATE
FROM IRAQ TERRITORY OVER INTONEIGHBORING SYRIA.
IRAQ AND SYRIA?
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT THEUMAYYAD DYNASTY ALL OVER AGAIN.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
IF YOU DO PLEASE DROP ME A NOTEBECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, IT CAN NOTBE GOOD.
YEAH.
IT CANNOT BE GOOD, FOLKS.
WHO PUTS TWOYs IN A ROW?
CLEARLY THE MARK OF MAD MAN.
THE POINT IS WE'RE FACING THEALARMING COLLAPSE OF THE IRAQI
GOVERNMENT THAT IT TOOK US EIGHTYEARS OF BLOOD AND TREASURE TO
INSTALL, AND IT'S ALL OBAMA'SFAULT.
[LAUGHTER]JIM?
>> I BLAME PRESIDENT OBAMAMIGHTILY FOR A HANDS-OFF
POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO IRAQ.
>> THE PRESIDENT'S INABILITY TONEGOTIATE A FORCES AGREEMENT IN
IRAQ, WHICH HAS PUT US IN THISSITUATION WE'RE IN TODAY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE APOLITICAL DECISION, A CAMPAIGN
PROMISE DECISION, NOT ASTRATEGIC VISION DECISION.
>> HE SIMPLY DIDN'T LIVE UP TOHIS PROMISES OF MORE ARMS AND A
DIPLOMATIC SURGE.
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT OBAMA.
GREAT JOB, DUDE.
>> Stephen: YEAH.

OPERATION PARTY FOUL.
