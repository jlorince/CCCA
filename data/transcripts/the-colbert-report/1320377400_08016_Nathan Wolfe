>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HAS SPENT
A CAREER INVESTIGATING THE
WORLD'S MOST DEADLY VIRUS.
TO PREPARE FOR THIS
INTERVIEW I PUT ON A CONDOM.
PLEASE WELCOME NATHAN WOLFE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DR. WOLFE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GET UP FOR ME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
VERY NICE.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE A
MICROBIOLOGIST, A PROFESSOR
OF HUMAN BIOLOGY AT
STANDFORD.
SO YOU ARE A SMARTY PANTS,
ALSO THE FOUNDER AND C.E.O.
OF GLOBAL VIRAL FORECASTING.
AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH
INSTITUTE DEVOTED TO EARLY
DETECTION OF LIKE PANDEMIC,
RIGHT.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YOU'VE GOT
A BOOK HERE.
IT'S CALLED THE VIRAL STORM,
THE DAWN OF A NEW PANDEMIC
AGE.
WHY DON'T YOU FLAME IT
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE
ALARMIST.
LIKE DISEASE KILL ZONE.
A VIRUS WILL TURN YOUR BLOOD
TO DUST BEFORE THE END OF
THIS SENTENCE.
SO WHERE DO YOU GET WHERE
DOW RESEARCH THESE VIRUSES.
HOW DO YOU COLLECT THEM?
>> YEAH, I MEAN SO, ONE OF
THE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
WE DO IS CREATING MUSEUMS OF
VIRUS AND BLOOD.
>> Stephen: KIDS, WE'RE
GOING TO THE VIRUS MUSEUM.
OKAY, YES.
YOU ARE A MUSEUM OF GERMS
AND BLOOD.
>> YEAH.
THAT'S US.
>> Stephen: BUT HOW DO YOU
GET THEM.
>> SO WE ARE POSITIONED IN,
ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES IN 20
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: WHAT COUNTRIES
WHAT ARE THE BIG DISEASE
COUNTRIES.
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING.
WE TEND TO WORK IN PLACES
THAT ARE SORT OF HOT SPOTS
OF DIVERSITY BECAUSE THOSE
MOST OF THESE VIRUSES COME
FROM ANIMALS.
SO THE MORE DIVERSITY OF
ANIMALS YOU V THE MORE
DIVERSITY OF VIRUSES THAT
CAN JUMP INTO US AS PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WHY DON'T WE GET
RID OF THE ANIMALS.
ATTACK THIS AT THE ROOT.
>> WELL, HERE'S THE OTHER
THING.
WE UNDERSTAND SO LITTLE
ABOUT THE WORLD OF MICROBES
AND MANY OF THESE THINGS ARE
VERY USEFUL.
FOR EXAMPLE A VIRUS THAT
CAME FROM COW, COW POX ENDED
UP BEING THE VIRUS THAT
ALLOWED US TO HE RAD CAT
SMALL POX SO THERE ARE
VIRUSES OUT THERE THAT ARE
LIKELY TO BE USEFUL.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE LIVE
VIRUSES IN OUR YOGURT.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: DO WE?
>> WE ABSOLUTELY DO, YEAH.
>> Stephen: I PULLED THAT
OUT OF MY ASS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> TALK ABOUT THE SOMEONES
THAT SCARE ITS HELL OUT OF
ME.
>> EBOLA.
>> FOR A WHILE BACK THERE WE
HEARD ABOUT EBOLA JUMPING
FROM MONKEYS TO HUMANS,
OKAY.
AND THEN A HUMAN WAS GOING
TO GET ON A PLANE, COME TO
AMERICA AND WE'RE ALL GOING
TO BE DEAD IN LIKE 72 HOURS.
I'VE SEEN THOSE MOVIES.
>> IF I HAD EBOLA, YOU KNOW,
WHAT, HOW WOULD I KNOW?
>> YEAH, I MEAN EBOLA IS A
VIRUS THAT LEADS TO VERY,
VERY SPECIFIC CLINICAL
SYMPTOMS.
>> Stephen: SUCH AS.
>> YOU HAVE BLOOD IN YOUR
VOMIT, YOU HAVE BLOOD IN
YOUR DIARRHEA.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
REALLY HAS AN INCREDIBLY
PROFOUND CLINICAL
PRESENTATION.
AND-- .
>> Stephen: IT'S ALWAYS KIND
OF A BAD SIGN WHEN YOU HAVE
BLOOD IN YOUR VOMIT THOUGH,
RIGHT?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: NO NEED TO TELL
ME ABOUT EBOLA FOR THAT.
>> YEAH, NO, THAT'S VERY
TRUE.
AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING
THING ISS WE JUST REPORTED
ON IDENTIFYING SOME
COMPLETELY NOVELL VARIANTS
OF EBOLA THAT WE FOUND IN AN
OUTBREAK THAT WE
INVESTIGATED WITH COLLEAGUES
IN CONGO.
>> Stephen: NOVELL DOES THAT
MEAN GOOD OR BAD.
>> IT MEANS COMPLETELY NEW
AND WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS
THERE ARE THINGS OUT THERE
THAT WE ARE STILL UNAWARE
OF.
AND THERE WILL BE OTHER
THINGS THAT WILL BE
EFFECTIVELY EBOLA 2.0, NEW
VIRUSES THAT WILL AFFECT
NEWS WAYS THAT WE HAVEN'T
BEEN AFFECTED IN THE PAST
AND WILL REALLY HAVE THE
POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THINGS
MASSIVELY, POTENTIALLY DUE
HUGE HARM TO HUMANS LIKE HIV,
LIKE INFLUENZA VIRUSES HAVE
DONE IN THE PAST.
>> Stephen: WHEN MY MOM WAS
A KID, SHE IS 91.
WHEN MY MOM WAS A KID EVERY
SUMMER AT THE END OF THE
SUMMER, THEY WOULD KIND OF
WAIT FOR THE NEWS AS TO
WHETHER POLIO WAS AROUND
AGAIN.
AND SOMETIME THESE WOULD GO
TO SCHOOL LATE BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH OTHER
KIDS.
IS THERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
COULD THAT HAPPEN AGAIN
WHERE EVERY YEAR FOR 50
YEARS WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER
THE THING IS GOING TO SPRING
UP AND JUST START KILLING
PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT?
>> WE LIVE IN A PROFOUNDLY
DIFFERENT WORLD THAN WE HAVE
LIVED IN.
EVEN IF YOU GO BACK 30, 50
YEARS AGO.
WE LIVED IN TOWNS, VILLAGES.
WE WEREN'T CONNECTED TO EACH
OTHER.
NOW IF YOU LOOK AT AIRPLANE
ROUTES AND THE WAY WE MOVE
BOATS AND ANIMALS AROUND,
WE'RE THIS SORT OF LARGE
MIXING VESSEL OF
MICROORGANISMS AND IT MEANS
THAT A VIRUS THAT POPS OUT
OF CENTRAL AFRICA OR
SOUTHEAST ASIA HAS OT
POTENTIAL TO GET TO HERE IN
NEW YORK OR TOKYO IN A
MATTER OF DAYS.
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE
SHOULD ALL BE VERY, VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT AND TAKE
SERIOUSLY.
>> Stephen: IF YOU DISCOVER
THE NEXT DEADLY VIRUS, CAN
YOU NAME IT AFTER YOURSELF?
BECAUSE WOLFE FLU, THAT'S
NOT BAD.
>> I MEAN LOOK,.
>> Stephen: YES OR NO,
SENATOR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, WE DO NEED-- .
>> Stephen: YES OR NO.
>> WE DO, WE ABSOLUTELY DO.
WE NAME THEM.
>> Stephen: DOW.
COULD I, COULD SOMEONE DIE
OF WOLFE FEVER.
>> VERY POSSIBLY.
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING NAME IT
AFTER ME.
WE'RE GOING TO NAME IT AFTER
USUALLY SORT OF A LOCATION
THAT WE WORK IN OR SOMETHING
THAT'S MEANINGFUL ABOUT THE
VIRUS, THAT GIVES US
INFORMATION ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: WHEN YOU FIRST
CAME OUT HERE I SHOOK YOUR
HAND.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THIS-- IS THIS DOES THIS
HELP ME IN ANY WAY.
DID I JUST DO ANYTHING OR IS
THIS JUST SORT OF WISHFUL
THINKING.
>> OH, NO, YOU ABSOLUTELY
DID.
USING ALCOHOL BASED HAND
SANITYIZERS WILL DEFINITELY
LIKE DESTROY BACTERIA AND A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VIRUSES,
SO ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THEN I'M WILLING
TO SHAKE YOUR HAND AGAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: NATHAN WOLFE,
THE BOOK IS THE VIRAL STORM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
