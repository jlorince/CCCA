( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE.
SO NICE TO HAVE YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE WITH YOU
HERE TONIGHT ON MY BIRTHDAY!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSEÑi ).
WOW.
BLIND ADULATION.
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.ñr
AND, FOLKS, WHEN I WOKE UP THIS
MORNING, THERE WAS ANOTHER
FANTASTIC GIFT UNDERNEATH MY
BIRTHDAY TREE.
AND, YES, I HAVE A BIRTHDAY
TREE.
WHY SHOULD JESUS BE THE ONLY
ONE?
AND THIS MORNING I UNWRAPPED A
BEAUTIFUL BOX OF CRIPPLING
SCANDAL FOR THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
FIRST UP, BENGHAZI.
HOW BAD IS IT, FOLKS?
NATION, YOU BETTER SIT DOWN AND
BUCKLE UP BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NOT
BE STANDING WHILE WATCHING TV IN
THE CAR.
NOW, EVERYONE KNOWS THIS WAS AN
UNQUESTIONABLE TRAGEDY WHERE
FOUR AMERICANS LOST THEIR LIVES
IN WHAT WE NOW KNOW WERE VICIOUS
TERRORIST ATTACKS.
BUT LISTEN TO HOW OBAMA
CALLOUSLY DESCRIBED THEM THE
NEXT DAY.
>> NO ACTS OF TERROR WILL EVER
SHAKE THE RESOLVE OF THIS GREAT
NATION.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
ACTS OF TERROR?
THEY WERE TERRORIST ATTACKS.
AM I THEçó ONLY ONE WH7D FEELS THISçó
WAY?
DARELL ISSA.
>> AN ACT OF TERROR IS DIFFERENT
THAN TERRORIST ATTACK.
>> Stephen: YES.Ñ
THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY WHAT DO
THE PO-TAH-TOE KNOW AND WHEN DID
HE KNOW IT?
NOW THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS STORY
FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS HAVE
BEEN ME AND FOX NEWS.
BUT FROM THE REST OF TELEVISION
AND RADIO, SILENCE.
JIM?
>> ACROSS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
IT WAS A COLLECTIVE YAWN IN
RESPONSE TO YESTERDAY'S BENGHAZI
COVERAGE.
>> WHY ARE THE MEDIA IGNORING
NEW DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE NIGHT OF THE BENGHAZI
ATTACK?
>> THE MEDIA IS REALLY PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S SCANDAL CONDOM.
NO MATTER HOW ROUGH THINGS GET,
NOTHING GETS THROUGH.
>> Stephen: GREG'S RIGHT.
THE MEDIA IS OBAMA'S SCANDAL
CONDOM AND NO MATTER HOW ROUGH
FOX NEWS SLAMS THIS STORY TO THE
HILT, THEY STILL HAVE REAL
TROUBLE INFECTING AMERICA WITH
THEIR NEWS HERPES.
BUT ACTS OF TERROR, TERRORIST
ATTACK, IS THAT REALLY THE
SCANDAL HERE?
NO.
THAT'S JUST SEMANTICS.
THIS IS ALSO ABOUT THE WORDS
PEOPLE USED.ñr
LET ME SET THE STAGE, FOLKS.
THIS ATTACK CAME TWO MONTHS
BEFORE THE ELECTION.
AND OBAMA COULD NOT HAVE AN AL
QAEDA ATTACK ON HIS WATCH WHEN
HE'S THE ONE WHO PERSONALLY
STRANGLED BIN LADEN WITH ONE OF
HIS SHOE LACES.
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HEçó CLAIMS.
SO TALKING POINTS WERE GENERATED
BY WHO KNOWS THAT DID NOT
MENTION AL QAEDA.
WHO SCRUBBED THE MEMOS?
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JAY
CARNEY, DANCE FOR YOUR SUPPERWiÑi
>> THE WHITE HOUSE AND STATE
DEPARTMENT HAVE MADE CLEAR THATñrçóñr
THE SINGLE ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS
MADE TO THOSEñr TALKING POINTS BYñrÑi
EITHER OF THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS
WERE CHANGING THE WORD
"CONSULATE" TO "DIPLOMATICçó
FACILITY."
>> Stephen: WOW.
CONSULATEçó TO DIPLOMATIC
FACILITY.
WOW, THEY REALLY HAVE A WAY WITH
THE LANGUAGE EWEN IS.
SO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE STATE
DEPARTMENT JUST CHANGED ONE
WORD.
HMMMM.
LET ME JUST CHANGE ONE WORD.
LIAR.
JIM?
>> TODAY ABC NEWS HAS
EXCLUSIVELY OBTAINED 12 VERSIONS
OF THE TALKING POINTS SHOWING
THEY WENT THROUGH EXTENSIVE
EDITS.
THE EARLY DRAFTS POINTED TO
EVIDENCE THAT AN AL QAEDA A FILL
RATED GROUP TOOK PART IN THE
ATTACK AND THAT THE C.I.A. HAD
WARNED ABOUT AL QAEDA THREATS IN
BENGHAZI.
>> THE TALKING POINTSHAMÑi
UNDERGONE 12 DIFFERENT REVISIONS
INCLUDING EXTENSIVE EDITS BY THE
STATE DEPARTMENT.
>> 12 CRAFTS.
THAT'S WORSE THAN A COVER-UP
FOLKS.
THAT'S OVERTHINKING.Ñi
YOU HAVE TO WRITE FROM THE
HEART.
AND THE REASON THESE TALKING
POINTS ARE SO IMPORTANT IS THAT
THEY TAKE US BACK TO THE MOMENT
THIS COVER-UP STARTED.
WHEN U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE
WENT ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS TO
SAY THE ATTACKS WERE
SPONTANEOUSLY INSPIRED BY THE
PROTESTS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN
CAIRO WHICH WERE OVER AN
OFFENSIVE YOU-TUBE VIDEO ABOUT
MOHAMMED BUT THANKS TO JONATHAN
CARL WE NOW KNOW THAT THE
ORIGINAL C.I.A. MEMO SAID THEIR
BEST GUESS WAS THAT THE ATTACKS
WErÑ SPONTANEOUSLY INSPIRED BY
THE PROTESTS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY
IN CAIRO AS DID EVERY OTHER
VERSION OF THE MEMO.
THAT DOES NOT HELP MY ARGUMENT.
SO FORGET THAT PART.
JUST REMEMBER THIS.
THEY TOOK OUT ANY MENTION OF AL
QAEDA AND REMOVED ALL THE C.I.A.
WARNINGS OF IMMINENT THREAT.
BOTTOM LINE.
SUSAN RICE WENT ON THE SUNDAY
SHOWS AND, FOR POLITICAL
REASONS, WAS NOT COMPLETELY
ACCURATE ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
YOU WOULD NEVER SEE A
