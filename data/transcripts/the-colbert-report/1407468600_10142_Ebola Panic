EBOLA OUTBREAK!
(CHEERING)EVERYONE IS ON HIGH ALERT!
(CHEERING)BUT MOSTLY BILL IN OUR GRAPHICS
DEPARTMENT!(CHEERING)
HERE'S HOW THE PLAGUE HAS SPREADSO FAR -- TWO AMERICAN HEALTH
WORKERS WHO CONTRACTED THEDISEASE WHILE TREATING PATIENTS
IN AFRICA HAVE BEEN EVACUATED TOEMORY UNIVERSITY FOR EMERGENCY
MEDICAL CARE.
TO ADD TO THE HORROR, EMORY ISIN ATLANTA SO THEY PROBABLY HAD
TO FLY DELTA!
AND IT BRINGS ME NO COMFORT TOKNOW THAT EBOLA IS SPREAD ONLY
THROUGH INTIMATE CONTACT WITHBODILY SECRETIONS SUCH AS VOMIT,
BLOOD OR FECES.
SPEAKING OF VOMIT, BLOOD ANDFECES...
DONALD TRUMP.
(CHEERING)HE TRIED --
DONALD TRIED TO WARN US ABOUTTHIS LOOMING PANDEMIC VIA
TWITTER.
STOP THE EBOLA PATIENTS FROMENTERING THE U.S.
TREAT THEM AT THE HIGHEST LEVELOVER THERE.
YES, WE SHOULD HAVE TREATEDTHESE DESPERATELY I'LL AMERICANS
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN LIBERIA!
NO CIVIL WAR ERA MEDICALTECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE SPARED!
THE FRESHEST LEACHES!
THE FINEST BITE STICKS!
AND, SURE, SURE, THESE PEOPLEWERE PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO
DESPERATE VILLAGERS, BUT THATDOESN'T MEAN THEY DESERVE
SPECIAL TREATMENT, RIGHT,DONALD?
>> THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE,THEY'RE TREMENDOUS PEOPLE, BUT
THEY HAVE O SUFFER THECONSEQUENCES.
>> Stephen: YES! YOU HAVE TO-- NO, NO, HE'S RIGHT!
NO, NO, NO, NO, WAIT, HEY,HEY...
I SAID NO!
YOU HAVE TO SUFFER THECONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR GOOD
DEEDS!
THAT'S WHY MOTHER THERESA'STOMBSTONE READS "SHE HAD IT
COMING"!
(LAUGHTER)AND THE NUMBER OF NEW EBOLA
CASES IN THE U.S. IS IMPOSSIBLETO COUNT BECAUSE IT IS ZERO!
(LAUGHTER)>> SO FAR SIX AMERICANS IN THE
UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN TESTEDFOR EBOLA, THANKFULLY ALL TESTS
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
>> IT'S PRETTY HARD TO CATCH SOI THINK IF YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT
THE POSSIBLITY OF HAVING A MAJOROUTBREAK IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU SHOULD REALLY JUST RELAX,YOU KNOW, TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND
WORRY ABOUT GETTING HIT BY A CARBECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT HIGHER
PROBABILITY OF THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU HEARD HIM,EBOLA HAS SPREAD TO OUR CAR
DEALERSHIPS!
NO WONDER THAT SALESMAN LOOKS SOSICK!
HE'S HAVING A SPASM AND THEYSTILL MAKE HIM COME TO WORK!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
BUT, FOLKS, JUST BECAUSE NO ONEHAS CAUGHT EBOLA IN AMERICA
DOESN'T MEAN EBOLA CAN'T CATCHYOU!
FOX NEWS BRAIN SURGEON BENCARSON, INFECT US WITH YOUR
FEAR.
>> IF THERE WERE A CONTAINER OFCONTAMINATED URINE AND SOMEHOW
IT MANAGED TO FIND ITS WAY TOSOMEPLACE, A LOT OF DAMAGE COULD
BE DONE.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GUARD FOR THEWORST CASE SCENARIO.
SO, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE COMES UPTO A LAB WORKER, HE KNOWS HE'S
GOT THE URINE, HOW WOULD YOULIKE TO HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS?
A LITTLE TRANSACTION THERE.
I MEAN -- YOU SAY THAT'S CRAZY,NEVER COULD HAPPEN.
SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TOHAPPEN.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU MAY SAYDR. BEN CARSON IS JUST YANKING
(BLEEP) OUT OF HIS ASS, BUT,REMEMBER, THAT'S ANOTHER WAY
EBOLA IS SPREAD.
(APPLAUSE)DR. CARSON IS RIGHT.
DR. CARSON, THIS GOOD MAN ISRIGHT.
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GUARD AGAINSTTHE WORSE POSSIBLE CASE SCENARIO
AND, FRANKLY, I CAN THINK OFWORSER SCENARIOS.
FIRST THE TERRORIST INJECT URINEINTO CIRCUS LIONS AND RELEASE
THEM INTO A BOY SCOUT JAMBOREE.
OR MORE PLAUSIBLE, LET'S SAYTHERE'S AN OPERA COMPANY ON
THEIR WAY A GIG, BUT THEIR BUSBREAKS DOWN AND OUTSIDE OF THE
CDC. THEY START SINGING, HIT AHIGH C, WHCIH CAUSES ALL THE
VIALS OF URINE TO SHATTER.
THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES IN ANDSUCKS ALL THE EBOLA INTO THE SKY
AND SUDDENLY IT'S RAINING DEATHPEE PEE!
OR OFTEN PLAUSIBLER, IT'S FRIDAYAND THE C.D.C. THROWS A PARTY,
-- IT'S A FUN PLACE, THEY COULDDO THAT --
AND THEY DECIDE TO SERVE CUPS OFMOUNTAIN DEW BUT THEY CAN'T TELL
THE MOUNTAIN DEW FROM THE URINE.
SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY COULDACTUALLY DRINK PEE-BOLA!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
I'M JUST JOKING.
(LAUGHTER)I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
THEY'RE BOTH URINE.(APPLAUSE)
NATION -- WE ONLY HAVE ONECHANCE.
IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ONLY HAVEONE CHANCE TO STOP THIS
SPREADING PANIC.
WE MUST ISOLATE THE SOURCE OFTHE OUTBREAK.
OUR IMAGINATION!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
