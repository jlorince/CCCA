(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE
HOSTS OF THE DISCOVERY
CHANNEL'S MYTHBUSTERS.
TOGETHER WE WILL BLOW UP ONE
LUCKY MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE.
PLEASE WELCOME ADAM SAVAGE
AND JAY ME HYNEMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, GUYS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> HELLO.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS STARTED
YOUR NEW SEASON ON WHAT,
LAST WEDNESDAY.
WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU
BLEW UP.
HAVE YOU BLOWN ANYTHING UP
YET?
>> NO, WE ACTUALLY DID
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MASKS.
WE HAD MASKS MADE OF EACH
OTHER AND THEN JAMIE WAS ME
AND I WAS JAMIE AND I GOT TO
DISCO DANCE AS JAMIE, THAT
WAS PRETTY COOL.
>> Stephen: THAT WAS A TEST
TO SEE IF YOU COULD MAKE
THAT MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
SWITCHEROO.
I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP.
LET'S SHOW WHAT YOU DID.
>> WHILE FACING OFF AGAINST
A MYTH ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT, --
>> WOW.
>> ADAM AND JAMIE HAVE
INCREDIBLY ACCURATE HANDMADE
MASKS MADE.
>> OH MY GOD.
>> THIS IS --
>> I WAS THINKING OF GOING
SOMEPLACE AND KICKING A
PUPPY AND THEN THEY WOULD
BLAME IT ON YOU.
>> GOOD GIRL.
GOOD GIRL.
>> SHE IS VERY CONFUSED.
>> NEW THAT'S YOUR DOG.
>> YES.
>> AND YOUR DOG THOUGHT YOU
WERE HIM.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: SO THEY DON'T
SMELL US, THEY ACTUALLY LOOK
AT US.
>> IT WOULD APPEAR SO.
>> Stephen: SO YOU BUSTED
TWO MYTHS THEN.
>> RIGHT THERE, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WOW.
DO YOU MAKE MORE PURPOSEFUL
DISCOVERIES OR MORE
ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERIES WITH
YOUR SHOW?
>> I WOULD SAY IT'S ABOUT
50/50, HONESTLY.
>> YEAH.
>> THE DOG TEST CAME UP AS
JAMIE JUST SUGGESTED IT
BECAUSE HE HAD HIS DOG FOR
THE DAY AND THOUGHT WE
SHOULD JUST TRY THAT OUT.
AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
TO BE A BUST AND THE DOG
TURNED OUT TO TOTALLY GO
RIGHT FOR ME AS JAMIE.
>> YEAH, BECAUSE MY WIFE HAS
THIS THING WHEN SHE GETS
HOME, SHE WILL SAY TO ZERO,
OUR DOG, WHERE'S JAMIE.
AND IT'S A GAME THEY PLAY.
AND SHE WILL GO THROUGH
EVERY ROOM UNTIL SHE FINDS
ME.
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY THAT
HERE AND WE WERE BOTH JUST
ASTONISHED THAT IT DIDN'T
WORK.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE THOUGHT
THAT PERHAPS YOUR DOG WAS
THE VARIABLE.
MAYBE YOU HAVE A
PARTICULARLY UNTALENTED DOG.
>> THAT COULD BE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, HAVE YOU
EVER-- HAVE THERE BEEN ANY
MYTHS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO
TEST BUT CAN'T?
>> WELL, WE STILL, WE DID
THE WHOLE EPISODE ON BUSTING
THE CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT
THE MOON LANDING WAS FAKE.
AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO ARE STILL UNCONVINCED.
SO WE WOULD LOVE TO IF TIME,
MONEY WERE NO OBJECT BUILD A
SPACESHIP, GO TO THE MOON
AND COME BACK WITH A PIECE
OF APOLLO HARDWARE ALL IN
ONE TAKE.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE
COOL.
CAN'T YOU GET A TELESCOPE
STRONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE
APOLLO STUFF ON THE MOON.
>> WE RESEARCHED IT, AND NO,
NOT EVEN THE HUBBELL CAN
RESOLVE THE IMAGES OF THE
MOON TO A TIGHT ENOUGH
RESOLUTION TO SEE ACTUAL
FOOTPRINTS OR APOLLO
HARDWARE.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU BE
OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT IT
DIDN'T HAPPEN, OR ARE YOU-- DO
YOU WANT TO PROVE IT?
SEE?
SEE, SEE.
>> IN THIS I HAVE TO ADMIT
TO SOME BIAS THAT WE'VE
ALREADY BEEN THERE.
I BELIEVE ABSOLUTELY
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT OF COURSE
WE WENT THERE.
>> Stephen: THEN ARE YOU
UNQUALIFIED TO HAVE TO
CHECK.
HOW I DO KNOW ARE YOU NOT
GOING TO BRING A PIECE OF
EQUIPMENT UP THERE.
I CAN'T TRUST YOU NOW.
ARE YOU LIKE EVOLUTIONARY
SCIENTIST, THEY WILL DO
ANYTHING TO PROVE THAT IT'S
REAL.
THEY ARE-- HOW I DO KNOW
THEY'RE NOT BURYING DINOSAUR
BONES IN THE EARTH.
CAN YOU BUST EVOLUTION?
>> YES, WE COULD BUT IT
WOULD BE THE MOST BORING
SHOW EVER IT WOULD TAKE
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS
AND WOULD BE VERY SLOW THERE
WOULD BE A LOT OF FRUIT
FLIES.
>> Stephen: JUST TAKE A
GLASS OF WATER, PUT A LITTLE
LID ON TOP, COME BACK IN
HALF AN HOUR F IT'S NOT A
TINY DOLPHIN, THEN IT DID
NOT ADAPT.
>> I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT'S A COMPLETE ENOUGH
TEST REALLY.
>> Stephen: GOOD ENOUGH FOR
ME.
>> I HAVE GOT A COUPLE I
WOULDN'T MIND YOU TESTING.
BABY WITH THE BATHWATER.
WHAT'S THE ACTUAL MYTH.
>> Stephen: DON'T THROW THE
BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER.
>> WHY?
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
AND SO I-- YOU FIND OUT
WHETHER THAT IS GOOD OR BAD.
YOU TAKE A BATH AND YOU PUT
A BABY IN IT AND YOU THROW
OUT THE WATER AND THE BABY
GOES WITH IT, AND YOU SEE
WHETHER THAT IS GOOD OR BAD.
>> BUT THERE HAS TO BE A
PRESUPPOSITION FROM THE
BEGINNING THAT IT IS GOOD OR
BAD.
>> Stephen: WE SAY IT IS BAD,
DON'T THROW THE BABY OUT
WITH THE BATHWATER.
THEY ARE SAYING YOU
SHOULDN'T DO IT.
>> I'M NOT AGAINST DOING IT
YOU ABOUT I DON'T NEED TO DO
IT TO KNOW THAT IT'S BAD.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT YOU
WERE CURIOUS.
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT EARLY
TO BED, EARLY TO RISE MAKES
A MAN HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND
WISE, BEN FRANKLIN.
GET TORY AND GRANT, GIVE
THEM EACH $100 BUCKS, OKAY,
TEST THEIR WASAL METABOLIC
RATE, HEALTH TEST THERE AT
THE BEGINNING, AND GIVE THEM
AN INTELLIGENCE TEST.
AND THEN OVER THE COURSE OF
TWO WEEKS ONE GOES TO BED
EARLY AND WAKES UP EARLY,
ONE STAYS UP LATE AND GETS
UP LATE AND TEST THEM AGAIN
TWO WEEKS LATER AND SEE
WHO'S GOT MORE CASH.
>> THAT IS EXACTLY HOW WE
WOULD DO THAT TEST.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY, YES.
AM THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAN WE LOOK
FORWARD TO.
CAN YOU TEASE US WITH A BIG
ONE COMING UP.
>> YES, WE'VE GOT REVERSE
ENGINEERING COMING UP.
IT IS REVERSE ENGINEERING.
>> YES, REVERSE ENGINEERING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOW MEAN.
>> THERE IS A MYTH THAT BACK
IN THE '80s A SPORTS CAR WAS
MADE THAT WAS SO POORLY
DESIGNED THAT IT WAS MORE
HEIR DYNAMIC GOING BACKWARDS
THAN FORWARD.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT.
>> I CAN'T SAY THE NAME OF
IT.
>> Stephen: LEGALLY.
>> LEGALLY I CAN'T SAY THE
NAME OF IT.
SO WE CUT IT OFF ITS
CHASSIS, FLIPPED IT 180 AND
PUT IT BACK DOWN AND RACED
IT AGAINST THE COUNTERPART.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
>> Stephen: I WON'T ASK BUT
I WILL WATCH.
>> IT'S PRETTY STUNNING.
AND CARRY GRANT AND TORY
TESTED THE MYTH OF BLUE ICE
CHARACTER A BATHROOM
AIRPLANE BATHROOM FAIL AND
SEND AN ICE CHUNK OF URINE
DOWN TO EARTH KILLING
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WHERE DID THAT
MYTH COME FROM.
>> IT CAME FROM ICE CHUNKS
FALLINGING ARE FROM THE SKY
KILLING PEOPLE THAT TURNED
OUT TO BE URINE.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, JAMIE THANKS SO MUCH.
