(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME
BACK, EVERYBODY, NATION,THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOUAGAIN.
THERE IS SOMETHING I NEED TOTALK TO YOU ABOUT RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOUTHAT THE WORLD IS FALLING
APART UNDER BARACK OBAMA'SLEADERSHIP.
I MEAN I'M GOING TO TELL YOUBUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT
NO ONE IS MAKING ME TELL YOUAND JUST WHEN AMERICA NEEDS
A STRONG LEADER MORE THANEVER WE ARE LOSING ONE OF
OUR GREATEST.
CAPTAIN AMERICA.
HE FIRST WON OUR HEARTS IN1941, ISSUE NUMBER 1 BY
PUNCHING HITLER IN THE FACE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND THE HULK, MAY I POINT
OUT THE HULK WAS NOWHERE TOBE FOUND.
I GUESS THE HOLOCAUSTDOESN'T MAKE BRUCE BANNER
THAT ANGRY.
HULK IGNORE ATROCITIES.
UNFORTUNATELY, CAP'S DAYS OFPROTECTING AMERICA ARE
NUMBERED AND THAT NUMBER IS21, JIM, RIGHT IN THERE.
THERE IT IS BECAUSE UNLESSYOU'VE BEEN FROZEN IN ICE
FOR THE LAST 65 YEARS, YOUKNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN
THIS ISSUE.
IT'S A TALE AS OLD AS TIME.
THE IRON NAIL CURRENTLY INHIS MONSTER FORM HAS
LAUNCHED A PLOT OF FRAMINGCAPTAIN AMERICA BY LAUNCHING
HELICARRIER GUNGNIR TO BE AFLYING ROBOT AND DESTROY THE
NATION OF NROSVEKISTAN.
OF COURSE ALL OF THIS ISJUST A FANTASY.
IN THE REAL WORLDNROSVEKISTAN HAS BEEN
ANNEXED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN.
BUT-- FOLKS-- (APPLAUSE)
WHEN CAP TRIES TO STOP HIMTHE IRON NAIL HITS HIM WITH
FLYING NEEDLES WHICH REMOVETHE SUPERSERUM FROM CAPTAIN
AMERICA'S BLOOD CAUSING HIMTO LOSE HIS SUPERSOLDIER
POWERS AND INSTANTLY AGE 65YEARS.
MEANING HIS NEW SUPERSERUMWILL BE ENSURE.
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THISIS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN CAPTAIN AMERICA WASTHIS CLOSE TO BEING PROMOTED
TO MAJOR AMERICA.
THIS IS A DISASTER, NATION,WITH STEVE ROGERS BROUGHT
THERE IS A HUGE VOID IN THECAPTAINING OF AMERICA.
I MEAN WHO AMONG US ISPREPARED TO STEP IN?
I MEAN-- OBVIOUSLY-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
I GOT TO SAY THAT HAD NOTOCCURRED TO ME.
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO BEEXTREMELY PATRIOTIC.
YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOKDECADES YOUNGER THAN YOUR
ACTUAL AGE AND IT SHOULD BESOMEONE WHO ALREADY OWNS
CAPTAIN AMERICA'S ACTUALSHIELD.
THAT'S RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THAT'S RIGHT.
THE SHIELD'S BEEN UP THERESINCE 2007.
I NEEDED IT IN MY BATTLEAGAINST NICKELBACK.
AND I FOR ONE, I WANT YOU TOKNOW THAT I WILL BE PROUD TO
WEAR THAT LETTER A AND THISTIME IT WON'T BE BECAUSE I
COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH A17th CENTURY REVEREND.
BUT WHO ULTIMATELY, WHO CANSAY WHO THE NEXT CAPTAIN
AMERICA WILL BE.
HERE TO SAY WHO THE NEXTCAPTAIN AMERICA WILL BE IS
THE CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICEROF MARVEL AND
FRIEND OF THE SHOW,JOE QUASADA.
THANKS SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANKS FOR BEING HERE THANKS

>> YEAH.
>> WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ONCAPTAIN AMERICA,
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THISGUY?

SACRIFICE, HE LOST THESUPER SOLDIER SERUM.

>> THAT IS AND THERE'S THEFALCON AS NEW CAPTAIN
AMERICA.
>> THERE IS JUST-- IS THISIN THE MOVIES.

>> THE COMICS ARE THE BESTBUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
THIS GUY, THIS NEW, THIS NEWGUY IS BLACK.
>> YES.
>> DOESN'T THAT MAKE HIMCAPTAIN AFRICAN-AMERICA?
>> I DIDN'T KNOW, I'M JUSTASKING.
>> I DON'T SEE COLOR.
>> YOU DON'T SEE COLOR,NEITHER DO I.
IF YOU DON'T SEE COLORS HOW DOYOU DO COMIC BOOKS?
ALL RIGHT, WAIT A SECOND,OKAY, IF FALCON IS NOW
CAPTAIN AMERICA DIDN'T THATMEAN THERE'S ANOTHER VOID,
DON'T WE NEED A NEW FALCON.
