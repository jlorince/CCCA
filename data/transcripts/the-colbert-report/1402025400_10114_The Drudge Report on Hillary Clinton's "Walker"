>> THANKS SO MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANKS.
FOLKS, FOLKS, CHECK YOURCALENDARS BECAUSE YOU OUGHT TO
KNOW THAT THE 2016 ELECTION ISRIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND I
AM FULL OF QUESTIONS.
WHO WILL RUN?
WHO WILL THE PARTIES NOMINATE?
SHOULD I HAVE SAID WHOM WILLTHEY NOMINATE?
WHEN DOES ONE USE THE OBJECTIVEPRONOUN FORM OF "WHO?"
HAVE I GOTTEN OFF TOPIC?
OF COURSE, THE QUESTION KARLROVE WANTS EVERYONE ASKING IS
WHETHER DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNERHILLARY CLINTON IS TOO OLD AND
INFIRM TO BE PRESIDENT.
>> KARL ROVE SUGGESTED HILLARYCLINTON MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE.
>> LOOK, SHE'LL BE 69 BY THETIME OF THE 2016 ELECTION.
SHE WILL BE 77 IF SHE SERVES TWOTERMS.
>> Stephen:  LET ME CHECK THEMATH THERE.
OKAY, YEAH, OKAY, I HAVE 69STRAWS IN ONE HAND, AND LET ME
GET-- LET ME GET EIGHT MORESTRAWS.
YEAH, YEAH, THAT REALLY FEELSLIKE
I'M GRASPING AT A LOT OF STRAWS.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
WELL, YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY, ONEEAGLE-EYED JOURNALIST CAST
FURTHER DOUBTS ABOUT HILLARYCLINTON'S ADVANCED DECREPITUDE.
>> HILLARY CLINTON'S RECENTCOVER SHOOT FOR PEOPLE MAGAZINE
IS RAISING A LOT OF EYEBROWS.
>> DRUDGE REPORT TWEETED, "ISCLINTON HOLDING A WALKER?"
>> Stephen:  THAT'S A FAIR ANDREASONABLE QUESTION.
I DO NOT DOUBT FOR A SECOND THATIF HILLARY CLINTON USED A
WALKER, SHE'D INSIST ONAPPEARING WITH IT ON THE COVER
OF "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE.
NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, THE HILLARYHUGGERS AT PEOPLE FLEW INTO
DAMAGE CONTROL RELEASING THISSTATEMENT.
"SECRETARY CLINTON IS STANDINGNEXT TO A PATIO CHAIR.
OF AS DOCTORS CALL IT ASTATIONERY POOL-SIDE JAZZY.
AND DRUDGE DIDN'T EVEN MENTIONTHAT RIGHT BESIDE CLINTON RIGHT
THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT THATALICE FROM THE "BRADY BUNCH"
DIED.
COINCIDENCE? OR DID HILLARYCLINTON BEAT HER TO DEATH WITH
HER WALKER?
( APPLAUSE ).
( CHEERS )I DON'T KNOW WHY CLINTON SAT FOR
THESE GERIATRIC PHOTOS.
SHE SHOULD FOLLOW REAGAN'SEXAMPLE AND ONLY POSE FOR
YOUTHFUL SHOTS LIKE THIS ONE.
NO, JIMMY.
I SAID THE SHOT OF RONALDREAGAN, NOT JUSTIN BIEBER.
WHAT? THAT'S HIM?
OH, ICY FRESH, GIPP-DOG.I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THEY
CALLED HIM. THE POINT IS, FOLKS,THIS PEOPLE ISSUE IS INCREDIBLY
DAMAGING FOR CLINTON.
I JUST CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HOWCONSERVATIVES REACT TO HER
LATEST PRESS CONFERENCE.
OH, MY GOD.
SHE'S STILL GOING TO WIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
