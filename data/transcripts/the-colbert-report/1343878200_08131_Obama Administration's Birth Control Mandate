WELL, TONIGHT WE SALUTE SENATOR AND GALAPAGOS AMERICAN MITCH McCONNELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YESTERDAY ON THE FLOOR OF SENATE McCONNELL ONCE AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE.
NOW WHY WAS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO STOP IT YESTERDAY?
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE TODAY IS THE DAY THAT RUSH LIMBAUGH TRIED TO WARN US ABOUT.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S CONTROVERSIAL CONTRACEPTIVE
MANDATE GOES INTO EFFECT TODAY.
MOST BUSINESSES INCLUDING KAT LICK INSTITUTIONS MUST ENSURE THAT HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDES
BIRTH CONTROL COVERAGE TO EMPLOYEES.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT.
FREE GOVERNMENT BIRTH CONTROL FOR ALL THE LADIES.
SO DON'T FORGET --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DON'T FORGET RESET YOUR WATCHES AND CHECK YOUR CALENDARS BECAUSE
IT'S NOW WHOROCLOCK ON THE FIRST EVERYBODY REPORTED TO BELL HOOKED UP TO THE YAZ FORCE
FEEDING TUBE LIKE A SEX CRAZED.
