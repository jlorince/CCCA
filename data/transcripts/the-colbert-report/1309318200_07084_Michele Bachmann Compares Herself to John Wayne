>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
VERY KIND.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, VERY KIND.
NATION --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY -- THANK
YOU, PLEASE, PLEASE.
PLEASE -- I HAVE TO -- I DON'T
HONESTLY KNOW WHY I FIGHT YOU.
I LIKE IT MORE THAN TALKING.
NATION, AS AN AMERICAN, I DEMAND
CHOICE!
WHETHER IT'S 23 FLAVORS OF
PRINGLES OR EIGHT REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
I DEMAND NINE.
LET'S FIND OUT IF THAT GUY WITH
A MUSTACHE IS A REPUBLICAN.
BUT UNTIL SENATOR POTATO DUST
DECLARES MY FRONT RUNNER IS
MICHELE BACHMANN BECAUSE SHE IS
FULL OF SURPRISES.
SHE STUNNED EVERYONE WHEN DURING
THE FIRST PRESIDENT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
SHE ANNOUNCED SHE IS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
THEN SHE ASTONISHED EVERYONE
WHEN ON HER BACHMANN FOR
PRESIDENT WEB SITE SHE ANNOUNCES
BACHMANN FOR PRESIDENT.
BUT YESTERDAY, FOLK, CAME THE
GREATEST SHOCK OF ALL WHEN SHE
CONFIRMED WHAT THE TWO PREVIOUS
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ONLY
OFFICIALLY HINTED AT.
>> IT'S SO GREAT TO BE HERE IN
IOWA AND EVEN BETTER TO BE HERE
IN WATERLOO WHERE I WAS BORN.
MY NAME IS MICHELE BACHMANN.
I STAND HERE IN THE MIDST OF
MANY FRIENDS AND MANY FAMILY
MEMBERS TO ANNOUNCE FORMALLY MY
CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen: SHE ANNOUNCED HER
CANDIDACY FROM WATERLOO, A NAME
SYNONYMOUS WITH VICTORY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SOMEBODY WON THAT BATTLE, RIGHT?
THIS FINE LADY WASTED NO TIME
BUTTERING UP THE PEOPLE OF IOWA,
NOT EASY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IOWANS COME PRE-BUTTERED.
JIM?
>> I OFTEN SAY EVERYTHING I NEED
TO KNOW I LEARNED IN IOWA.
>> Stephen: REPUBLICAN, SHE
LEFT IOWA AT AGE 12 AND HAS HAD
THE COURAGE NOT TO LEARN
ANYTHING SINCE.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE --
GOOD-LOOKING LADY.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW MICHELE
BACHMANN SO SHE TOLD FOX NEWS
EVERYTHING SHE WANTS US TO KNOW.
>> WHAT I WANT THEM TO KNOW IS
JUST LIKE JOHNWAY WAS FROM
WATERLAO, IOWA, THAT'S THE
SPIRIT I HAVE TOO.
>> Stephen: SHE HAS THE SPIRIT
OF JOHN WAYNE BUT THE CRITICS
COULDN'T WAIT TO IT IN PICK ON A
DETAIL.
>> JOHNWAY IS FROM IOWA BUT
THREE HOURS AWAY.
THERE'S A JOHN WAYNE FROM
WATERLOO BUT IT'S JOHN WAYNE
GACY.
>> Stephen: SEXUAL SERIAL
KILLER IS FROM WATERLOO BUT
THAT'S SEM MANTICS.
BACHMANN SAID SHE MISSPOKE.
THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE.
NO RETREAT, NOR IS ROUNDER.
-- SURRENDER.
IT'S DAY ONE.
DON'T SHOW WEAKNESS.
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
APOLOGIZING FOR.
ALL YOU SAID IS YOU HAVE THE
SAME SPIRIT AS JOHN WAYNE GACY
AND THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT
BECAUSE LIKE GACY PEOPLE MIGHT
THINK YOU ARE A CLOWN BUT IF
THEY DIG A LITTLE DEEPER THEY'LL
FIND YOU ARE DEADLY SERIOUS.
COME ON, YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN.
YOU DON'T STUMBLE ON FACTS.
YOU DOUBLE DOWN.
IN THE ONLY DOLL YOU HAVE THE
SPIRIT OF JOHN WAYNE GACY,
YOU'VE GOT THE EYES OF A YOUNG
CHARLES MANSON.
