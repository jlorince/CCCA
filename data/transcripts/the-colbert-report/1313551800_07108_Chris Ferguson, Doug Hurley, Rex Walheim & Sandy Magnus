(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEROES ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, WE'RE ALL
SO THRILLED THAT YOU'RE HERE.
BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU KEEP
YOUR HAIR FROM GETTING MESSED UP
IN THE HELMET.
>> YOU DON'T.
>> Stephen: NOT EASY IN
>> NO.
YOU JUST GIVE IT UP.
>> Stephen: CAPTAIN CHRIS
FERGUSON, COLONEL DOUG HURLEY,
COLONEL REX WALDHEIM, DR. SANDRA
MAGNUS, IT'S A THRILL FOR ALL OF
US TO HAVE YOU HERE.
I PERSONALLY WHEN I WAS A KID I
WANTED TO GROW UP AND BE AN
ASTRONAUT.
I KNEW THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
ONCE I WENT INTO PUNDITRY.
(LAUGHTER)
DID ALL OF Y'ALL WANT TO BE
ASTRONAUTS WHEN YOU WERE GROWING
UP?
>> I'LL START.
I WATCHED NEIL ARMSTRONG WALK ON
THE MOON ANDD FROM THAT MOMENT
FORWARD THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT
OF A GLIMMER THERE.
I STARTED FLYING AIRPLANES AND
FURTHER ON DOWN THE LINE MADE A
MARRIAGE OF THE TWO AND ENDED UP
BECOMING AN INSTRUMENT.
IT'S REALLY SPECTACULAR.
>> Stephen: ANYBODY ELSE?
WAS THIS A CHILDHOOD SDPLEPL
>> I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING WE
THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN WE WERE
YOUNGER BUT IT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS YOU DON'T TAKE SERIOUSLY.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT THE SHUTTLE
MISSION IS DONE, WHAT DO YOU
DREAM OF GROWING UP TO BECOME?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S
>> THAT'S A HARD QUESTION.
THAT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS THE LAST
FIGHT LIKE?
DID YOU GUYS FIGHT TO SEE WHAT
WOULD BE THE LAST PERSON IN
SPACE?
WERE YOU ALL HOPING FOR THE LAST
SEAT IN THE SHUTTLE SO YOU COULD
SAY I WAS THE LAST ONE UP THERE.
>> IT WOULD BE THEM.
>> I WAS THE LAST ONE TO BOARD
THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS KIND OF
FUN BECAUSE THESE GUYS WERE
SITTING ON THEIR BACKS
UNCOMFORTABLE AND I GOT TO STAND
ON THE LAUNCH PAD AND WALK
AROUND AND LOOK AT THE OCEAN
THEN IT WAS MY TURN GO AND I GOT
TO CROSS THE GANTRY FOR THE LAST
TIME AND CLIMB ON BOARD THE
VEHICLE.
>> Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE
LANDING IT THE LAST TIME,
CAPTAIN, YOU LANDED THE SHUTTLE,
CORRECT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID IT FEEL TO
KNOW YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
LANDING A SHUT?
>> WELL, BOY, IT'S AN EMOTIONAL
MOMENT AND A LOT LED UP TO IT.
A LOT OF FOLKS SAID WHAT WOULD
IT FEEL LIKE?
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN
IT'S OTHER AND I SAID I'LL LET
YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER, IT
WAS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT.
IT WAS YOU HAVE TO FOR US TO GET
OUT OF THE ORBITER KNOWING THAT
THERE WOULD BE NOBODY ELSE TO
FOLLOW IN OUR FOOTSTEPS IN A
SPACE SHUTTLE.
ON THAT.
>> Stephen: ON THAT LAST MISSION
DID ANY OF YOU, KNOWING THAT YOU
WERE THE LAST SPACE SHUTTLE
ASTRONAUTS TO GO UP, DID YOU
HAVE ANY SENSE OF, LIKE,
SENIORITES?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, LIKE CHECKLIST BE
DAMNED.
I'M GOING TO FLOAT WHOLE TIME
AND BITE WATER OUT OF THE AIR.
(LAUGHTER)
ANY OF THAT, DID YOU PHONE IT?
>> WE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF
THAT.
>> Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE BLOWN
IT NOW.
>> I KNOW.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG DID WE HAVE
THE SHUT?
>> 30 YEARS AND A FEW MONTHS.
>> Stephen: AND WHAT IS WAITING
TO REPLACE IT?
>> INSTEAD OF HAVING A NASA
SPONSOR THE SPACE BUSINESS WE'LL
PROBABLY HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF
A COMMERCIAL SPACE LINE.
AND IN THE MEANTIME, IN THE
INTERIM, IN THE SWER SCREENING
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS WE'RE GOING
TO BUY SEATS FROM THE RUSSIANS
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK AND
FORTH ON A RUSSIAN SPACECRAFT.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH IS IT GOING
TO COST US TO BUY A SEAT FROM
THE RUSSIANS.
BECAUSE THAT BUGS ME.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE WE GOT INTO THIS THING
TO BEAT THE US AREKYS AND NOW
WE'RE HAVING TO STICK OUR LEG
OUT AND HITCH A RIDE.
WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST US?
>> $63 MILLION.
>> $63.
>> I THINK THE LAST TIME THE
CONTRACT WAS $63.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU WE TRIED
PRICELINE?
BECAUSE YOU CAN NAME YOUR OWN
PRICE AND GET A LAST MINUTE...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
I MEAN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
IT'S WILLIAM SHATNER, CAPTAIN
KIRK.
HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET US A
BETTER PRICE.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME
SOMETHING FROM THE SHUTTLE
LAUNCH PAD THAT YOU'D LIKE TO
PRESENT.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
AND THIS PROBABLY BEARS A LITTLE
EXPLANATION.
THE SPACE SHUTTLE IS ACTUALLY
HELD TO THE LAUNCH PAD WITH
EIGHT VERY LARGE NUTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND THIS IS ONE OF
THEM?
>> THAT IS ONE OF THE NETS
AND...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AT THE MOMENT THAT THE SOLID
ROCKET BOOSTERS, THE BIG WHITE
ONES FIRE, THERE'S CHARGES IN
EITHER SIDE OF THAT NUT WILL
THAT WILL SPLIT THAT NUT IN HALF
AND ACTUALLY RELEASE THE SPUTLE
FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA SO
THAT IT MAY ASCEND INOR BID.
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D PRESENT YOU
WITH THIS ARTIFACT OF OUR LAST
SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT.
>> Stephen: WOW!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, AS IF LAUNCHING A
ROCKET WERE NOT PHALLIC ENOUGH,
YOU LITERALLY BUST A NUT WHEN
YOU GO INTO SPACE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, HEROES ALL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU FOR FIRING THE
IMAGINATION OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE COMMANDER CHRIS FERGUSON,
COLONEL DOUG HURLEY, COLONEL REX
WALHEIM AND DR. SANDRA MAGNUS,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
