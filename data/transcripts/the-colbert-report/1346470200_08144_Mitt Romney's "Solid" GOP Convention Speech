(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY.
HEY!
FANTASTIC TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
NATION --
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THATS WITH A LITTLE DELAYED BUT I WILL
TAKE IT ANYWAY I CAN GET IT I'M NOT PROUD.
FOLKS, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
LAST NIGHT WAS THE FINAL EVENING OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AND, OF
COURSE, THEY SAVED THE LAST FOR LAST.
(LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY DID A GREAT JOB.
THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT THAT THIS MAN WAS GOING TO STICK THE LANDING BECAUSE HE
NEVER LEFT THE GROUND.
(LAUGHTER) HE ANSWERED:-- ENTERED THROUGH THE CROWD, ENGAGING IN THE TRADITIONAL HUMAN
GREETING OF PALM GRASP.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A SPEECH, HE GAVE ONE.
(LAUGHTER) AND NOT JUST WORDS-- LIKE THAT?
AND NOT JUST WORDS, FOLKS.
SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT,
DIFFERENT TENSES, JIMMY BLOW YOUR MITT LOAD.
>> IF EVERY CHILD COULD GO TO SLEEP FEELING WRAPPED IN THE LOVE OF YOUR FAMILY AND
GOD'S LOVE THIS WORLD WOULD BE A FAR MORE GENTLER PLACE.
MY MOM AND DAD GAVE THEIR KIDS THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL, THE GIFT OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THAT WAS FROM THE HEART.
AND UNLIKE OBAMA, MITT ROMNEY DOES NOT RELY ON TELEPROMPTERS.
HE RELIES ON HALLMARK CUE CARDS.
(LAUGHTER) HE TOOK A LONG TIME PICKING THEM OUT.
GOES THROUGH ALL OF THEM.
FOLKS, WITH A SPEECH LIKE THIS, IT'S REALLY HARD TO PICK A HIGHLIGHT.
BUT IF I HAD TO PICK A MID LIGHT, IT WOULD BE THIS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED TO BEGIN TO SLOW THE RISE OF THE OCEANS.
AND TO HEAL THE PLANET MY PROMISE IS TO HELP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
>> Stephen: YEAH, [BLEEP]
THE PLANET!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHOW OF HANDS, HOW MANY OF YOUR FAMILIES LIVE ON THE PLANET?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, THEN IT SEEMS A LOT LESS FUNNY, NOW.
NOW FOLKS, WHEN THE SPEECH WAS OVER, THE REACTION IN THE PUNDIT SPHERE WAS UNANIMOUS.
SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED.
>> THE MOST COGENT ANALYSIS OF ALL CAME FROM CHRIS WALLACE ON FOX NEWS.
>> YOU KNOW GUYS I WAS GOING GO THROUGH A LONG CHECKLIST OF WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE
SPEECH AND I DIDN'T LIKE,
BUT IT'S SILLY.
BECAUSE TONIGHT PEOPLE ARE ONLY LOOKING AT THE EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES OF
THESE BEAUTIFUL FAMILIES AND,
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY IS GOING TO MATCH ANY OF THIS.
SO I'M JUST GOING TO SHUT UP AND WATCH.
>> Stephen: THANKS, CHRIS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A GREAT NEW SLOGAN.
FOX NEWS, JUST SHUT UP AND WATCH.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT OF COURSE-- BUT OF COURSE THE QUESTION REMAINS,
WAS ROMNEY'S SPEECH EFFECTIVE WINCE THOUGHT THAT SPEECH WAS GOOD ENOUGH.
>> IT WAS A WORKMAN LIKE JOB,
IT CERTAINLY GOT THE JOB DONE.
>> THIS WAS A SOLID SPEECH.
>> A VERY SOLID, DARE I SAY BUSINESS-LIKE SPEECH.
>> IT WAS A SOLID SPEECH.
>> A SOLID SPEECH.
>> HE DID A SOLID JOB.
>> A SOLID GUY.
>> Stephen: YES, QUESTION ALL AGREE THAT MITT ROMNEY IS A SOLID.
MATTER CANNOT PASS THROUGH HIM.
AND HE DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE SHAPE OF HIS CONTAINER.
AND FOLKS, SOLID WAS ALL MITT NEEDED TO BE.
>> IF THE GOAL WAS THE SPEECH WAS THAT MITT ROMNEY IS A PLAUSIBLE PRESIDENT, I
THINK HE SUCCEEDED ON THAT LEVEL.
>> Stephen: IT'S TRUE,
DURING THE PRIMARIES WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT MITT'S ELECT ABILITY BUT NOT ABOUT
HIS PLAUS ABILITY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT HIM,
HE'S PLAUSIBLE.
I MEAN WHO NEEDS YES WE CAN.
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE YES, WE CAN IMAGINE THE SCENARIO WHERE THIS COULD HAPPEN.
(LAUGHTER) SO-- A CLEAR TRIUMPH AFTER NEARLY A DECADE OF WORKING TOWARD THIS MOMENT.
MITT, THE NOMINEE WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF ALL THE PAPERS LIKE THE "U.S.A. TODAY".
WE DESERVE BETTER.
AND OF COURSE-- AND OF COURSE RUPERT MURDOCH'S CONSERVATIVE "NEW YORK POST"
HAD HIM SPLASHED ACROSS THE LOWER RIGHT 16th EDGE IN WHAT MANY CALLED THE SNOOKI CORNER.
THE REST OF THE PAGE, OF COURSE, WAS DEDICATED TO A MORE DYNAMIC
