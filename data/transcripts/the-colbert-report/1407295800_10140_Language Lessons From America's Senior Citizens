>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW-- FOLKS, SOMEHAVE SAID THAT THE UNIVERSAL
LANGUAGE IS MUSIC.
OTHERS SAY THAT IT'S LOVE.
YET, I'VE ALWAYS HAD TROUBLECOMMUNICATING VIA SAXOPHONE
DRY HUMPING.
THE REAL UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE ISENGLISH.
IT'S A VERBAL SKELETON KEY YOUCAN USE TO TALK WITH ANYONE ON
EARTH, EXCEPT YOUR DRY CLEANER.
DONDE ESTA MY PANTS, ABILIO!
SO IT'S NO WONDER THE WORLD ISDESPERATE TO LEARN ENGLISH,
WHICH HAS OPENED THE DOOR FORTHE BRAZILIAN LANGUAGE TRAINING
COMPANY C.N.A. TO EXPLOIT ADANGEROUS NEW SOURCE OF ENGLISH
EXPERTISE.
>> WE CREATED A TOOL THATCONNECTS OUR STUDENTS WITH
STUDENTS IN THE U.S.A. LIVING INRETIREMENT HOMES
>> HELLO?
HELLO, HELLO.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> YES, I CAN, CAN YOU HEAR ME.
>> I LIVE WITH MY OLD BROTHER
HE HAS 23 YEARS.
>> DO YOU KNOW INSTEAD OFSAYING, "HE HAS 23 YEARS, "YOU
COULD SAY, "HE IS 23 YEARS OLD."
>> Stephen:  NATION, THIS ISTHE MOST TERRIFYING THING I HAVE
EVER SEEN.
AND I HAVE 50 YEARS.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, THAT YOUNG BRAZILIANS ARE
LEARNING ENGLISH FROM OUR SENIORCITIZENS, IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL
THEY HAVE FLUID DISCUSSIONSABOUT SHERBET, EARLY BIRD
SPECIALS.
AND BRAZILIAN TEENS ARE TAKINGMORE THAN JUST LANGUAGE FROM OUR
ILLEGAL IMMI-GRAMPS.
>> THAT'S ME AND MY WIFE WHEN WEWERE YOUNG.
>> OH, YOU WERE GOOD LOOKING.
>> GOOD MORNING, DEAR JULIA.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> IF YOU WERE HERE, I WOULDGIVE YOU A BIG HUG.
>> OH, YEAH, A HUG.
>> YOU ARE MY NEW GRANDDAUGHTER,AND I LOVE YOU.
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.
>> Stephen:  THEY'RE STEALINGOUR LOVE!
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
NO! FIGHT IT!
NATION, THESE CARING HUMANRELATIONSHIPS ARE AN
ABOMINATION.
IN AMERICA YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSEDTO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ELDERLY.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STORE YOURFEELINGS UP ALL YEAR UNTIL
CHRISTMAS WHEN YOU THERETO ITOUT WITH ONE EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED, "THANK YOU FOR THESWEATER."
WORSE, THESE ANCHOR OLDIES AREARMING THE HISPANIC HORDES
WITH THE WISDOM OF THE GREATESTGENERATION
WE CAN'T LET THESE KIDS LEARNTHE SECRETS OF LIFE FROM THE
PEOPLE WHO BEAT HITLER.
THEN HOW WILL WE BEAT HITLERNEXT TIME?
REMEMBER, THIS IS BRAZIL.
HE MIGHT STILL LIVE THERE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
