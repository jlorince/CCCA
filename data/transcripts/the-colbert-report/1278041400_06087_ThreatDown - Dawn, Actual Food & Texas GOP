THEY'RE JUST LIKE US."
NATION, IT'S LATE.
AND I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE
GOING TO BE SLEEPING SOON, BUT
DON'T WORRY.
THERE'S NO MONSTER UNDER YOUR
BED.
THE MONSTER IS YOUR BED.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
[SIRENS BLARING]
FOLKS, REGULAR VIEWERS WILL KNOW
THAT LAST MONTH I FLOATED MY
BOLD THEORY ABOUT JUST WHO WAS
REALLY BEHIND THAT OIL LEAK IN
THE GULF.
JIM?
>> SOMEONE WHO HAS SOMETHING TO
GAIN FROM OIL-SOAKED WILD LIFE.
♪ ♪♪
>> Stephen: OF COURSE!
DAWN DISHWASHING LIQUID.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER
THREE.
DAWN DISHWASHING DETERGENT,
BECAUSE NOW I'VE GOT
CONFIRMATION THAT DAWN IS
RESPONSIBLE.
NPR RECENTLY TOOK A BREAK FROM
SEEKING OUT THE NATION'S MOST
INACCESSIBLE JAZZ TO COVER THIS
STORY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> BUT THE PANE DOESN'T
ADVERTISE AND THESE DAYS IS
RELUCTANT TO ADMIT THAT THE
GREASE-CUTTING PART OF THE
POTION IS MADE OF PETROLEUM.
>> IN FACT, DAWN IS ALMOST
1/7th PETROLEUM, SO FOR
EVERY SEVEN GALLONS THEY USE THE
CLEAN UP A BIRD, THEY HAVE TO
USE ANOTHER GALLON JUST TO CLEAN
UP THE DAWN.
SO IT'S CLEAR, FOLKS, DAWN
CAUSED THE OIL SPILL SO THAT
ANIMAL RESCUERS WOULD BUY DAWN
SO THEY HAVE THE MAKE MORE DAWN
SO THEY'D HAVE TO FIND MORE OIL,
WHICH INEVITABLY LEADS TO
ANOTHER OIL SPILL.
IT'S THE WORST CLEANING PRODUCT
SCANDAL SINCE MR. CLEAN WAS
CAUGHT GIVING THE BRAWNY GUY A
SPIC N' SPAN.
IT WAS FANTASTIK.
NEXT ON THE T-DOWN, SHOCKING
NEWS FROM THE GROCERY AISLE.
>> CHECK YOUR PANTRY SHELVES IF
YOU HAVE A CAN OF SPAHGETTIOS
WITH MEATBALLS.
THEY MAY NOT BE SAFE TO EAT.
>> THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE
LAST RECALL WHEN THEY
ACCIDENTALLY FILLED THE CANNES
WITH ZEROS INSTEAD OF Os.
ZEROS HAVE NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE.
THE REASON THE FEDS ARE CRYING
UH-OH SPAGHETTI-O THIS TIME IS
THESE CANS OF PROCESSED PASTA OR
PROS-TA MAY BE UNDERPROCESSED,
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER
TWO: ACTUAL FOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO
TRUST TO BREAK DOWN NUTRIENTS,
YOUR MEASLY DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OR
THE ENTEK MASTER BATCH.
IT IS CAMPBELL'S RESPONSIBILITY
TO BURN, BOIL AND PULP EVERY
LOST DROP OF ORGANIC MATTER OUT
OF THOSE LITTLE O'S UNTIL YOU'RE
NOT SURE IF IT'S PASTA OR
REINFORCEMENT DISKS.
THIS RECALL IS A CRISIS.
IF WE DON'T HAVE PROCESSED
SPAGHETTI-O'S, WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO EAT, SPA SPAGHETTI?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT
IS TO TIE THOSE THINGS INTO TINY
O'S?
FINALLY, FOLKS, THE TEXAS G.O.P.
HAS RELEASED THEIR NEW PLATFORM,
WHICH HAS A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS.
FOR ONE, IT CALLS FOR THE
ADOPTION OF AMERICAN ENGLISH AS
THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF TEXAS.
NOW, I WOULD SAY BRAVO, BUT I
DON'T WANT TO GET ARRESTED FOR
SPEAKING SPANISH.
[LAUGHTER]
AND AN EVEN BETTER PLANK OF THIS
PLATFORM, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALREADY
BANNED IN TEXAS, REPUBLICANS
WANT TO MAKE GAY MARRIAGE A
FELONY AND THEY WANT TO
CRIMINALIZE SODOMY.
FOLKS, THIS IS A FULL-PROOF WAY
TO END HOMOSEXUALITY IN TEXAS.
GAY PEOPLE ARE GOOD LAW-ABIDING
CITIZENS.
SO IF WE MAKED SO PI ILLEGAL,
I'M SURE THEY'LL STOP DOING IT.
AND IF THEY DON'T, WE'LL SEND
THEM TO JAIL, WHERE THERE IS NO
SODOMY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOT TO USE THE NOODLE.
GOT TO USE THE NOODLE, FOLKS.
AND THE TEXAS G.O.P.'S
ANTI-SODOMY PROPOSAL BRINGS ME
TO THREAT NUMBER ONE, THE TEXAS
G.O.P. GUY, NOWHERE IN THE
PLATFORM DO YOU SPECIFY WHAT
KIND OF SODOMY.
I MEAN, CHECK YOUR DICTIONARY.
IT'S A PRETTY BROAD TERM.
COVERING BASICALLY ANYTHING
FREAKIER THAN A FIRM HANDSHAKE
FACE TO FACE BETWEEN YOU AND
YOUR LAWFUL WIFE BEFORE YOU GO
TO YOUR SEPARATE TWIN BEDS.
I'M ALL FOR BANNING THE GAY
KIND, BUT SOMETIMES SODOMY CAN
BE A DEPRAVED, UNNATURAL ACT OF
DEBASEMENT BETWEEN MAN AND A
WOMAN AS GOD INTENDED.
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THERE'S
SODOMY AND THEN THERE'S SODOMY.
IT'S REALLY IN THE EYE OF THE
BEHOLDER.
WHICH CAN ALSO BE A FORM
