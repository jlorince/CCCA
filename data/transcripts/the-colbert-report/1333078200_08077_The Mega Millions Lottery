THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I AM NOT SURPRISED.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, I AM NOT SURPRISED BY THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM.
EXCITED.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I HOPE, I CERTAINLY HOPE LIKE ME YOU'VE GOT LOTTO FEVER.
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT LOTTO RASH.
BUT TO SAY I'M DOING A LOT OF SCRATCHOFFS.
AND TOMORROW, FOLKS S THE DRAWING FOR THE MEGAMILLIONS LOTTERY.
$540 MILLION.
NOW TO PUT THAT INTO-- TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE,
IF YOU LAID 540 MILLION DOLLAR BILLS END-TO-END YOU WOULD REGRET IT BECAUSE
PEOPLE WOULD DEFINITELY JUST COME AND TAKE IT.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, I GOT THE WINNER.
RIGHT HERE.
WENT WITH MY OLD STANDBY, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, OKAY.
SAME AS MY BANK PIN.
YOU KNOW WHAT JIMMY, LET'S EDIT THAT OUT.
OKAY, THANKS.
NOW I'M SURE I AM GOING TO WIN BECAUSE I PICKED THESE NUMBERS WITH THE HELP OF THE
INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST OVER AT ABC NEWS.
ON TUESDAY GMA BLEW THE LID OFF THE SCIENCE BEHIND WINNING THE LOTTO WITH THE
HELP OF RENOWNED LOTTO THEORIST ITCHED LUST LUSTIG.
>> WE WENT TO RICHARD LUSTIG WHO WROTE THE BOOK ON WINNING AFTER THE HITTING
THE JACKPOT HIMSELF SEVEN TIMES.
HE SAYS FIRST DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
>> MAKING SURE THE SET OR SETS OF NUMBERS YOU PLAY HAVE NEVER COME UP BEFORE.
>> Stephen: VERY IMPORTANT.
NUMBERS THAT WIN NEVER WIN AGAIN.
SO DON'T PLAY THESE NUMBERS OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE NUMBERS, ALL RIGHT.
YOU WANT TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
ALL RIGHT?
INSTEAD, INSTEAD OF THESE LOSERS TRY THE SQUARE ROOT OF 2, PI, TRHEVEN AND WHILE
THIS IS A MADE UP NUMBER T HAS NEVER WON WHICH MEANS IT'S DUE.
BUT ABC NEWS DUG DEEPER.
>> DON'T LEAVE IT TO THE MACHINE.
PICK YOUR OWN NUMBERS.
>> DO NOT PLAY QUICK PICK.
>> YES, A COMPUTER IS JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU RANDOM NUMBERS.
BUT YOU HAVE A RANDOM SYSTEM.
PLUS IF YOU LET THE MACHINE PICK AND YOU WIN LEGALLY YOU HAVE TO SPLIT YOUR WINNINGS WITH IT.
AND YOU KNOW HE'S JUST GOING TO BLOW IT ON HOOKERS AND COKE.
SO OBVIOUSLY THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A RANDOM CHANCE AT VICE BOOK.
YOU WANT TO BUY MY BEST-SELLER STEPHEN COLBERT'S HOW TO WIN A COIN TOSS EVERY TIME.
(LAUGHTER) THIS BOOK, THIS BOOK HAS BEEN THE WINNING INGREDIENT IN TWO OF THE LAST TEN SUPERBOUMS.
HERE'S THE SECRET.
A COIN HAS TWO SIDES.
ALWAYS PICK HEADS IF IT'S A PRESIDENT'S HEAD.
NEVER BET ON SACAJAWEA.
THE INDIAN'S LOST THE WHOLE CONTINENT.
THEY'RE TO THE GOING TO WIN A COIN TOSS.
AND OBVIOUSLY NOW, OBVIOUSLY I'M TALKING ABOUT AMERICAN COINS ONLY.
NOT CANADIAN.
THEY'RE METRIC.
NOT SURE HOW MANY SIDES THEY HAVE.
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, CALL ME ABC NEWS.
HEADS
