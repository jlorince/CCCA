[LAUGHTER]
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH I'M ON
IT, FOLKS?
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH I'M ON
THIS PRIMARY?
JUST LOOK AT TODAY'S ANY TIMES.
THEY HAVE SOME STORY ABOUT ME
GETTING A REFERENDUM ON THE
SOUTH CAROLINA BALLOT.
THROW IT UP THERE.
COLBERT PUSHES CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE REFERENDUM.
LOOK.
LOOK, FOLKS.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE REPORTERS GET
THESE WILD IDEAS OTHER THAN MY
PRESS RELEASE AND THE FOLLOW-UP
PHONE INTERVIEW.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH, HERE'S THE
TRUTH: I LOVE SOUTH CAROLINA.
IT'S MY HOME STATE.
AND IT'S FROM THAT RICH CULTURE
THAT I GET MY LOVE OF LIBERTY,
MY PERSONAL VALUES AND MY
CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY ON BARBECUE
SAUCE.
I LOVE IT EVEN MORE THAN I LOVE
COLBERT SUPER PAC.
YOU KNOW OUR MOTTO, SAY IT WITH
ME: MAKING A BETTER
TOMORROW TOMORROW.
YOU'RE GOOD.
WHEN WE FOUNDED MY PAC NINE
MONTHS AGO, NATION, I PROMISED
YOU WOULD BE PLAYERS IN 2012,
YOUR VOICE WOULD BE HEARD IN THE
FORM OF MY VOICE.
AND YOU WOULD BE HEARD ON THE
ISSUE YOU CARED MOST ABOUT,
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
AND, FOLKS, THEY ARE PEOPLE.
IF YOU PUBLIC A CORPORATION,
DOES IT NOT BLEED?
NOW, TECHNICALLY I DOESN'T, BUT
IT DOES SUE, SO DO NOT PUBLIC
THEM.
-- PRICK THEM.
FOLKS, I WAS THRILLED LAST MONTH
WHEN I GOT THE SAMPLE BALLOT FOR
THE SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY AND I SAW THIS
REFERENDUM: IN ORDER TO ADDRESS
THE MATTER OF CORPORATE
PERSONHOOD, THE ENFRANCHISED
PEOPLE OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF
SOUTH CAROLINA SHALL DECREE THAT
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE OR ONLY
PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE.
DO YOU LIKE THAT REFERENDUM?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
DO YOU LIKE THAT?
I DO.
I LIKE THAT REFERENDUM A LOT.
THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY HOW I
WOULD HAVE PHRASED IT.
IN FACT, THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY
THE WORDING I SENT TO THE SOUTH
CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY TWO
MONTHS AGO ALONG WITH A SIZEABLE
CASH OFFER TO PUT THIS
REFERENDUM ON THE BALLOT.
JIMMY, LET'S SEE THE REFERENDUM
AGAIN.
OKAY.
NOW PUT UP MY E-MAIL.
NOW DO SOME CSI STUFF WITH IT.
[LAUGHTER]
WHOO!
[APPLAUSE]
IT LOOKS LIKE COLBERT EAST SUPER
PAC IS IN THE POLE POSITION.
NOW IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU
WHAT UNLIMITED... IT JUST GOES
TO SHOW YOU WHAT UNLIMITED SUPER
PAC MONEY CAN DO.
ALSO, SUPER PAC PAID FOR THE
SUNGLASSES.
SO I GOT YOU YOUR REFERENDUM,
NATION.
UNFORTUNATELY LAST MONTH THE
SOUTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT
RULED THAT NON-BINDING ADVISORY
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS ONE COULDN'T
BE PLACED ON ANY PRESIDENTIAL
PRIMARY BALLOT.
REALLY, SOUTH CAROLINA SUPREME
COURT?
NO NON-BINDING QUESTIONS?
I BELIEVE THAT SOUTH CAROLINA
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR
SOMETHING THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE AN EFFECT.
AFTER ALL, JON
