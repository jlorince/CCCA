>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, WES MOORE, HAS
WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED "THE OTHER
WES MOORE."
I WONDER WHICH ONE IS HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME WES MOORE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. MOORE, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
NOW, SIR, YOU HAVE A FASCINATING
STORY TO TELL HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> IT IS ALL IN YOUR BOOK, "THE
OTHER WES MOORE: ONE NAME, TWO
FATES.
" THE CHILLING TRUTH IS HIS
STORY COULD HAVE BEEN MINE.
THE TRAGEDY IS THAT MY STORY
COULD HAVE BEEN HIS.
WHO IS THE OTHER WES MOORE?
>> WELL, THE OTHER WES MOORE IS
CURRENTLY SERVING A LIFE
SENTENCE IN PRISON FOR THE
TRAGIC MURDER OF A POLICE
OFFICER, AND REALLY WHAT I
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WITH THIS
STORY IS THERE ARE WES MOORES IN
EVERY COMMUNITY ALL AROUND THIS
COUNTRY IN URBAN AND RURAL
AREAS, AND IN MANY WAYS THE WES
MOORS WE'RE CREATING IS OUR
ATTENTION TO OUR SOCIETY OR AN
APATHY.
>> Stephen: SO YOUR NAME IS
WES MOORE AND YOU ARE NOT IN
PRISON FOR MURDER.
>> I AM NOT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A DECORATED
VETERAN OF THE AFGHAN WAR,
CORRECT?
YOU HAVE A BRONZE STAR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, I AM NO FAN OF THE SMARTY
PANTS, BUT YOU ARE A RHODES
SCHOLAR, AS WELL.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE
OTHER WES MOORE?
BE HONEST HERE.
WERE YOU GOOGLING YOURSELF?
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT THE
WONDERFUL WES MOORE TODAY.
AND THEN YOU SAW THIS OTHER
STUFF?
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?
>> FIRST TIME I FOUND OUT ABOUT
HIM, I WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA ON A
STUDY-ABROAD PROGRAM.
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY
MOTHER.
SHE SAID, I HAVE SOMETHING
CRAZY.
THERE'S POLICE ALL OVER YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD AND POLICE ARE
LOOKING FOR MAN NAMED WES MOORE
IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF
A POLICE OFFICER.
THAT'S HOW I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT
HIM.
>> Stephen: DID YOU... THIS IS
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD BACK HOME?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHERE WAS THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD?
>> BALTIMORE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU KNOW THIS
OTHER WES MOORE?
>> I DID NOT.
>> Stephen: NEVER MET HIM
BEFORE?
>> NEVER MET HIM, BUT AFTER I
FIRST LEARNED ABOUT HIM, I
STARTED READING DIFFERENT ARLGS
ABOUT THIS TERRIBLY TRAGIC
MURDER OF THIS POLICE SERGEANT.
I REALIZED WE HAD SO MUCH MORE
IN COMMON THAN OUR NAME.
WE WERE LIVING IN THE SAME
NEIGHBORHOOD, SAME ACADEMIC AND
DISCIPLINARY TROUBLES GROWING
UP, BOTH AROUND THE SAME AGE.
IT HAUNTED ME TO THE POINT WHERE
I WROTE HIM A NOTE.
A MONTH LATER I RECEIVED A NOTE
BACK FROM JESS SOME CORRECTIONAL
INSTITUTION OF WES MOORE.
>> Stephen: THE BOOK IS WHAT
MADE THE DIFFERENCE FOR EACH WES
MOORE.
WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE FOR
YOU?
I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S ALL
ABOUT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.
THIS SPEAKS TO CHARACTER BEING
DESTINY, CORRECT?
>> IT DOES.
IT SPEAKS TO PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY, BUT IT ALSO
SPEAKS THE THAT MARRIAGE OF BOTH
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ALSO
COLLECTIVE AND SOCIETAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
COLLECTIVE SOCIETAL
RESPONSIBILITY?
ARE YOU SAYING I AM MY BROTHER'S
KEEP CENTER
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A
CHILD?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
SAYING INCH MANY WAYS YOU FIND
WES MOORS OF ALL TYPES IN
COMMUNITIES ALL OVER.
EVERY DAY WE'RE HELPING TO
FOSTER THESE DIFFERENT
WES MOORS.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF WES
MOORE MOREIRAS ARE WE FOSTERING.
ALL THESE THINGS ARE FACTORS IN
WHAT TYPE OF NATION WE BECOME.
>> Stephen: DID YOU MEET HIM
IN PERSON?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DID HE LIKE
MEETING YOU?
DID HE LIKE BEING THE DON'T
COLUMN WES MOORE?
BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF HARSH.
HE'S NAMEFULLY BE WES MOORE,
DON'T BE WES MOORE.
HE'S THE OTHER WES MOORE.
>> YEAH, BUT I THINK ONE THING
THAT HE KNOWS AND ONE THING I
TRIED THE HIGHLIGHT IN THE BOOK
IS THIS IS REALLY A CAUTIONARY
TALE BECAUSE IT'S A CAUTIONARY
TALE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS
AS WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS AND
WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR ALL
OF OUR DECISIONS ARE AND HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE PEOPLE
IN YOUR LIFE TO HELPING YOU TO
MAKE RIGHT DECISIONS.
>> Stephen: SO OUR DESTINY
RIDES ON A KNIFE'S EDGE BASED
UPON THE LOVE AND CARE WE'RE
GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE.
>> I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT.
ONE THING I REALLY LEARNED ABOUT
THIS IS HOW LITTLE SEPARATES US
FROM ANOTHER LIFE ALTOGETHER.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE
SMALLEST THING?
WHAT'S THE THING THAT'S CLOSEST
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU THAT WAS
LIKE ALMOST A DAILY DECISION
THAT YOU MADE?
>> WELL, I THINK FIRST THING IS
THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAD
SURROUNDING US, THE PEOPLE WE
HAVE IN OUR LIVES, WHETHER IT BE
FRIENDS, ROLE MODELS, THE PEOPLE
WHO WE CHOSE TO LOOK UP TO IS I
THINK ONE THING YOU SAW
REPETITIVELY THROUGHOUT THE BOOK
THAT YOU STARTED SEEING THESE
SMALL DECISIONS BECOME BIG
DECISIONS.
>>
>> Stephen: YOU SEE A MOVIE IN
THIS?
I SEE WILL SMITH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WILL SMITH.
MAYBE I'M THE OTHER WES MOORE.
>> THERE'S GOT TO BE A ROLE FOR
YOU.
THAT'S MY ONLY CONDITION.
THERE'S A ROLE FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: I'LL BE THE
WARDEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
