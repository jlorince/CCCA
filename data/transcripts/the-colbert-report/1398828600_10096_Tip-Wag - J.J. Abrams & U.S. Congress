NATION, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVEHONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY, BUT
A CLOSE SECOND IS LYING ABOUTHOW HONEST YOU ARE.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FIRST UP ON TIP-WAG, I AM A HUGEFAN OF "STAR WARS."
I SAW THE ORIGINAL MOVIE WHEN IWAS 13, AND LET ME TELL YOU,
PRINCESS LEIA'S FIRM, HIGH BUNSSTIRRED SOMETHING IN ME.
SO WHEN I HEARD THEY WERE MAKINGA NEW STAR WARS LET'S JUST SAY I
WAS THE ONE TO SHOOT FIRST.
SO FAR--( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )SO FAR--
( CHEERS )THOSE ARE STAR WARS FANS.
SO FAR WE KNOW THAT MARK HAMILL,CARRIE FISHER, AND HARRISON FORD
ARE ALL CONFIRMED TO BE IN THENEW MOVIE WHICH I BELIEVE WILL
BE TITLED "EPISODE 7: A NEWHIP."
NOW, SOME SUPER FANS OUT THEREARE A LITTLE SKITTISH ABOUT THE
RELAUNCH BUT THE DIRECTOR IS MYGOOD FRIEND J.J. ABRAMS, WHO
JUST RELEASED THIS PHOTO OF THEVERY FIRST TABLE READ OF THE NEW
MOVIE.
IT IS SO COOL TO GET A GLIMPSEBEHIND THE SCENES.
WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OFMY FINGER TO J.J. ABRAMS FOR
BLOWING IT.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PHOTO.
EVERYTHING IS WRONG.
WHERE ARE THE CREATURE DESIGNS?
EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER ISHUMANOID WITH TWO ARMS AND TWO
LEGS.
AND THOSE SEATS ARE CLEARLY NOTCANON.
THEY'RE TATOOINE BATTLE COUCHES.
THEY SHOULD BE DANTOOINE ATTACKSOFAS. AND HAVE THESE PEOPLE
EVER HEARD OF THE HALOCRONDATABASE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
OH, BUT STEPHEN, I'M SURE HE'DSAY, IT'S JUST ONE PHOTO.
CRY ME A MOISTURE FARM.
WHATEVER SCRUFFY NERFHERDERRELEASED THIS PHOTO HAS
METACHLORIANS FOR BRAINS... NEXT UP, FOLKS, I MAKE NO
SECRET OF MY LOVE OF RONALDWILSON REAGAN.
MY DOG'S NAME IS GIPPER.
MY POOL IS SHAPED LIKE AJELLYBEAN AND I KEEP A
SLEDGEHAMMER IN MY TRUNK SO AT AMOMENT'S NOTICE I CAN TEAR DOWN
THAT WALL.
MY APOLOGIES ONCE AGAIN TO THESAN DIEGO ZOO.
I'M SURE EVENTUALLY YOU WILLFIND THOSE LEOPARDS.
FOLKS, I HAVE LONG SAID REAGANDOES NOT GET ENOUGH PRAISE.
YES, WASHINGTON, D.C.'S AIRPORTIS NAMED AFTER HIM BUT HE HAS TO
SHARE THAT HONOR WITH PRESIDENTNATIONAL.
SO I WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THIS.
>> THE FIRST ITEM FORCONSIDERATION IS HR4017 TO
DESIGNATE A PEAK LOCATED INNEVADA AS MOUNT REAGAN.
>> THIS WOULD DESIGNATE ONE OFTHE PEAKS NEAR LAS VEGAS AS
MOUNT REAGAN.
>> Stephen:  THAT, OF COURSE,IS COMING TO YOU HOT AND HARD
FROM NATIONAL COMMITTEE ONRESOURCES FROM CPAN42.
I'M GOING TO GIVE A TIP OF MYHAT TO THE U.S. CONGRESS FOR
GIVING REAGAN HIS OWN MOUNTAINAND WHAT A MAJESTIC GEOLOGIC
FORMATION IT IS.
NATION, BEHOLD MOUNT REAGAN.
LO HOW SHE SOARS 1,900 FEETABOVE THE DIRT.
THIS BROWN MOUNTAIN'S MAJESTY ISCROWNED WITH AN OFF-LIMITS
SUBSTATION.
ALL OTHER PRESIDENTIAL PEAKS BOWDOWN BEFORE YE, MOUNT REAGAN.
MOUNT McKINLEY, YOUR PURE HASNOTHING ON MOUNT REAGAN'S
IRON-RICH DUST.
IF THIS MOUNTAIN DOESN'T SEEMIMPRESSIVE TO YOU NOW, JUST GIVE
PEOPLE THIRTY YEARS TO FORGETWHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE AND IT
WILL SEEM LIKE THE GREATESTMOUNTAIN OF ALL TIME.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
