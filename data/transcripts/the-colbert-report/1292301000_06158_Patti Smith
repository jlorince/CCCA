( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) 2348
HEY, MS. SMITH, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR COMING ON.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, THE C.V. HERE
IS QUITE INTERESTING TO THE
UNINITIATED.
YOU ARE A WRITER, A PERFORMER,
AN ARTIST.
YOU'RE SEMINOLE ALBUM HAILS IN
THE TOP 100 ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.
YOUR MEMOIR NOW IN PAPERBACK
JUST KIDS FOLLOWS YOUR LIFE IN
THE LATE '60s AND EARLY
'70s.
IT WON THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD.
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S A HELL OF A...
>> GUILTY.
>> Stephen: AND YOU STARTED
OFF, YOU AND MAPLETHORP STARTED
OFF SLEEPING IN THE STREETS.
>> WELL, I WAS.
ROBERT HAD A LITTLE PLACE TO
SLEEP.
>> Stephen: AND HE WASN'T
TOSSING YOU A BONE?
>> I HADN'T MET HIM YET, BUT I
CAME TO NEW YORK CITY LOOKING
FOR A JOB.
AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY
UNTIL I GOT A JOB I SLEPT WHERE
I COULD.
AND NEW YORK SEEMED LIKE A
REALLY SAFE PLACE TO ME.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: REALLY, 1970'S NEW
YORK SEEMED LIKE A SAFE PLACE?
>> WELL, IT WAS 1967.
>> BECAUSE THE POLICE WERE NICE
AND ALSO NOBODY BOTHERED YOU.
I WAS FROM A RURAL AREA THAT HAD
NO LIGHTS AND IT WAS DARK ALL
ALL THE TIME.
NEW YORK CITY THE LIGHTS WERE
ALWAYS ON AND THERE WAS ALWAYS
ACTION.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS NEW YORK
LIKE BACK THEN?
THERE WERE NO STARBUCKS.
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR MacYAW
TOES?
>> I DON'T LIKE ALL THAT STUFF.
>> Stephen: YOU LIKE MUSIC.
THERE WAS NO IMTUNES.
WHERE DID YOU GET MUSIC?
>> WE SANG A CAPPELLA.
IN THOSE DAYS, RIGHT AROUND THE
SAME TIME THE DINOSAURS WERE
WALKING, WE SANG A CAPPELLA, WE
LISTENED TO THE JUKEBOX AND THE
RADIO AND WE DRANK BLACK COFFEE
AND WE HAD NO CREDIT CARDS WITH
A NUMBER FIVE ON THEM.
>> Stephen: NO CHANCE TO LOSE
THEM.
SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE THE MOTHER
OF THE PUNK ROCK WORLD.
THAT MUST BE A DIFFICULT FAMILY
TO RAISE.
BECAUSE THEY'RE
ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN, AREN'T THEY?
>> FIRST I WAS QUEEN.
THEN I WAS THE PRINCESS.
-- I WAS THE PRINCESS, THEN THE
QUEEN.
THE OLDER I GET, THE MORE MY
NAME CHANGES.
I THINK I'M ALL THE WAY TO
GODMOTHER OR GRANDMOTHER AT THIS
POINT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK PUNK
ROCK IS STILL ALIVE OR DO YOU
THINK THE PEOPLE DOING IT NOW
ARE POSERS?
>> I THINK MOST ART IS A PUNK
ROCKER.
I THINK IT'S A STATE OF MIND.
ANYBODY CAN BE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU STILL
ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AREN'T YOU A
AUTHORITY NOW.
YOU'RE A WINNER OF A BOOK AWARD.
THAT'S THE MAN SAYING YOU'RE THE
MAN, PATTI SMITH.
DO YOU WANT THE TAKE THAT AWARD
AND SAY, I DON'T [BLEEPED] WANT
IT.
>> I LIKE MY AWARD.
>> Stephen: YOU DO?
>> I LIKE IT.
AS AN ARTIST, I KNOW WHO I AM.
I KNOW WHAT I WORK FOR.
I WORK TO DO... I TRY TO DO GOOD
WORK AND GIVER THINGS OF MERIT
TO THE PEOPLE.
I DON'T WORK TO WIN AWARDS, BUT
IF I GET ONE, I AM REALLY HAPPY.
>> Stephen: ME TOO.
I GOT MY EMMY OVER THERE, MY
PEABODY.
I GOT A GRAMMY.
YOU GOT A GRAMMY.
>> NO, I NEVER GOT A GRAMMY.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A GRAMMY.
>> I DON'T WANT A GRAMMY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
NEVER WON ONE.
THEY'RE GREAT.
THEY'RE NO NATIONAL BOOK AWARD.
SO YOU WROTE SONGS AND POEMS FOR
SO MANY YEARS.
THIS IS AN ENTIRE BOOK.
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WRITING A SONG AND A
BOOK.
DID YOU GET TO THE END OF PAGE
ONE AND GO, WHEW, I'M EXHAUSTED?
>> THE DIFFERENCE, WRITING THE
BOOK WAS LIKE WRITING A SONG IN
A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE WHEN YOU
WRITE A SONG, YOU HAVE YOUR
LISTENER, YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE IN
MIND, AND WHEN I WAS WRITING,
THAT I JUST WROTE, IT WAS LIKE
WRITING A MOVIE FOR THE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BUT WHAT ADVICE...
>> ARE YOU OKAY?
>> Stephen: I'M JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT... WHAT ADVICE WOULD
YOU GIVE TO A YOUNG PERSON WHO
IS TRYING TO BECOME AN ARTIST,
WHO IS TRYING TO DECIDE, I'M
GOING TO THROW AWAY MY LIFE AND
BE AN ARTIST.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: BECAUSE IT REALLY
IS.
YOU'RE ROLLING THE BONES WHEN
YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
>> THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
SACRIFICE.
>> Stephen: YOU MAY NOT GET
OFF SLEEPING ON THAT SUBWAY.
NOT EVERYBODY GETS NATIONAL BOOK
AWARD.
>> YOU HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD.
YES, I THINK THAT VAN GO AND
WILLIAM BLAKE DID NOT GET
NATIONAL BOOK AWARD.
>> Stephen:, NO THEY DIDN'T.
>> BUT I JUST AM HARD WORKER AND
I GUESS I'M LUCKY.
>> Stephen: IS THAT THE
DIFFERENCE?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD TELL A
YOUNG PERSON?
WOULD YOU SAY COME TO NEW YORK?
IS NEW YORK STILL FRIENDLY?
>> I THINK NEW YORK IS ONE OF
THE GREATEST CITIES IN THE WORLD
AS FAR AS DIVERSITY, BUT IT IS
NOT WELCOMING TO THE YOUNG
ARTIST.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE NOW.
IT'S SHIFT ITS PERSPECTIVE.
I THINK THAT'S A SAD THING.
IT'S STILL A GREAT CITY, BUT I
THINK, YOU KNOW, BEING AN
ARTIST, YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO
SACRIFICE.
YOU HAVE TO BE READY, IT'S LIKE
BEING A MOTHER.
YOU HAVE TO... IT'S A FULL-TIME
JOB.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY I'M
FATHER.
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE I'M NOT INTO THE
SACRIFICE PART.
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT LIVING WITH
ROBERT MAPLETHORP.
HE WAS A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL
ARTIST, CERTAINLY IN HIS OWN
TIME, EVEN MORE NOW THAT THE
COUNTRY HAS BECOME MORE
CONSERVATIVE.
DO YOU EVER WORRY HE MIGHT TAKE
A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU ON THE
TOILET AND THAT MIGHT END UP AT
THE MET?
>> YOUR TOILET BACK STAGE IS THE
WARMEST TOILET I HAVE EVER...
IT'S A HEATED TOILET.
>> Stephen: IT ALSO BLOWS ON
YOUR PRIVATE PARTS.
IT IS A JAPANESE TOILET.
WE HAD IT INSTALLED FOR THE
GUESTS.
>> WELL, I DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION, BUT I'M SURE IF ROBERT
WOULD HAVE SHOT ME ON A TOILET,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIC, BUT HE
DIDN'T AND WE HAD A VERY COLD
TOILET, UNLIKE YOURS.
>> Stephen: WELL, I'M GLAD WE
COULD WARM PARTS OF YOU UP
TONIGHT.
PATTI SMITH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PATTI
SMITH.
