[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, I LOVE DESSERT.
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS EAT IT
FIRST, AS A REWARD FOR THE SALAD
I CAN'T FINISH BECAUSE I'M
ALREADY FULL.
BUT THERE'S A SPECIAL PLACE IN
MY HEART FOR DIPPIN' DOTS, THE
DELICIOUS DESSERT PELLET CREATED
BY FLASH-FREEZING DROPS OF ICE
CREAM BATTER IN LIQUID NITROGEN.
AT LAST, WE'VE FULFILLED OUR
DREAM OF A DESSERT THAT LOOKS
LIKE CARE BEAR SCAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO DEVASTATED
TO HEAR THAT DIPPIN' DOTS HAS
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.
THIS IS A DISASTER, FOLKS.
DIPPIN' DOTS WAS "THE ICE CREAM
OF THE FUTURE."
IF DIPPIN' DOTS IS IN THE PAST,
WE NOW LIVE IN SOME BIZARRE
POST-FUTURE TIME-SCAPE.
NATION, THIS LEAVES A GAP IN THE
FUTURE-DESSERT CONTINUUM.
WHAT WILL WE EAT IN THE FUTURE
NOW?
HOVER PIE?
TIRAMISU ON A MONORAIL?
HEISENBERG'S UNCERTAINTY
POPSICLE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE DIPPIN
DOTS' PLACE AS THE ICE CREAM OF
THE FUTURE.
I RECOMMEND STEPHEN COLBERT'S
AMERICONE DREAM.
CHAWSES OF.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MMMMM MMMMM NOW, FOLKS, --
FOLKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UNFORTUNATELY, I'VE BEEN SHAKEN
BY SOME TERRIBLE NEWS FROM
JERRY OF BEN AND JERRY'S DURING
HIS RECENT SLUMMING ON JIMMY
FALLON:
>> WELCOME YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU FOR OUR OWN FLAVOR
THE BIG ISSUE EVERYONE IS
TALKING ABOUT -- IS IT
OUTSELLING STEPHEN COLBERT'S ICE
CREAM?
>> THE FLAVOR IS DOING REALLY,
REALLY WELL-- BUT THE SHORT
ANSWER IS YES, IT'S OUTSELLING
STEPHEN'S ICE CREAM.
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW IS THIS
POSSIBLE?!
MY ICE CREAM IS DELICIOUS.
AND JIMMY'S IS-- WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO CRAP ON JIMMY'S ICE
CREAM BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMPROVE
THE FLAVOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THESE SALES FIGURES WERE HARD
ENOUGH TO TAKE.
BUT THEN JIMMY SANK TO A NEW
LOW.
>> I MADE ANOTHER GREAT STRIDE
IN MY ICE CREAM FLAVOR SUPREMACY
OVER MY ETERNAL ENEMY FOR SIX
MONTHS, STEPHEN COLBERT.
WE CAME UP WITH A CONTEST WHERE
YOU CAN SEND PHOTOS OF ALL THE
DISGUSTING THINGS YOU CAN DO
WITH COLBERT'S ICE CREAM BESIDES
EAT IT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, JIMMY.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
I'LL DO SOMETHING WITH MY ICE
CREAM OTHER THAN EAT IT.
I WILL USE IT TO CRUSH YOU!
I WILL PROVE THAT MINE IS THE
ICE CREAM OF THE FUTURE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ARE YOU READY?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
WELCOME FROM THE PHYSICS
DEPARTMENT AT ITHACA COLLEGE,
DR. MATTHEW C. SULLIVAN AND THE
QUANTUM LEVITATOR!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS SAY QUANTUM LEAVATION
DEVICE, CORRECT.
>> IT IS INDEED
>> Stephen: NATION, AS I'M SURE
YOU KNOW, "QUANTUM LEVITATION"
REFERS TO THE PHENOMENON WHEREBY
THE MAGNETIC FLUX LINES FLOWING
THROUGH A TYPE-TWO
SUPERCONDUCTOR ARE PINNED IN
PLACE DESPITE THE
ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES ACTING
UPON THEM.
I LEARNED THAT FROM THE INSIDE
OF A SNAPPLE CAP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DR SULLIVAN,  CAN YOU CONFIRM
THAT IF MY ICE CREAM QUANTUM
LEVITATES, IT WILL BE THE ICE
CREAM OF THE FUTURE?
>> ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S JUST
SCIENCE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: EXCELLENT!
HERE WE HAVE SOME OF MY
AMERICONE DREAM.
IT'S AVAILABLE IN MINI CUPS
WHICH IS JIMMY'S IS NOT.
OKAY?
AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT IT IS
DELICIOUS.
NOW, ARE YOU READY TO SEND MY
ICE CREAM INTO THE FUTURE?
ICE CREAM OF THE FUTURE, ENGAGE!
IT LEVITATED.
IT LEVITATED.
OH, JIMMY, LOOK.
LOOK, JIMMY IT'S LEVITATING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
EAT IT, FALON.
EAT THE FUTURE!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HIT IT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
