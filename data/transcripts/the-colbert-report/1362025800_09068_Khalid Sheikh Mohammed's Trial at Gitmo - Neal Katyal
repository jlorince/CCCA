DEATH BOTS.
[LAUGHTER]
HERE TO SHED LIGHT ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT GITMO UNTIL HIS MIC IS CUT BY UNSEEN FORCES IS
FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES AND LEAD COUNSEL FOR THE GITMO DETAINEES
IN HAMDAN V. RUMSFELD NEAL KATYAL.
NEAL GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, WATCH WHAT YOU SAY, I HAVE A FEELING THAT THERE ARE CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES
POINTED AT US.
DO WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN AT GITMO?
WHAT IS CONTROLLING THE SWITCH NOW?
>> WE DON'T.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS CONTROLLING THE SWITCH.
THE JUDGE DIDN'T KNOW.
THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING.
>> Stephen: SEEMED TO COME AS A SURPRISE TO HIM.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IT'S A MILITARY JUDGE AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE MICROPHONES ARE
COMING FROM.
>> IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
IT REMINDS ME.
THE ONLY PRECEDENT FOR IT IS THE SOVIET CONSTITUTION OR IRANIAN CONSTITUTION.
>> Stephen: WE'RE NOTHING LIKE THE OLD SOVIET UNION.
WE DON'T HAVE GULAGS IN SIGH BEERA.
WE HAVE GULAGS IN HE IS STONEA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IS IT ULTIMATELY SUCH A BAD THING.
THESE GUYS ARE GUILTY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE KSM IS GUILTY?
>> I BELIEVE HE IS LIKELY GUILTY AND THAT'S WHAT TRIALS ARE ALL ABOUT.
>> Stephen: THE THING WITH TRIALS IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE FOUND INNOCENT.
THAT'S THE ONE FLAW WITH OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, I BELIEVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE.
>> THE BEAUTIVE TRIAL SYSTEM IS THAT IT GIVES LEG MATCY AND IT SAYS THIS PROSECUTION MADE A LOT
OF SENSE.
THEY ARE LIKE BASEBALL AND STEROIDS.
AT THIS POINT EVEN IF THE PROSECUTORS HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK THERE'S AN THE AS TERRIFIC
SAYING WAIT THERE WERE SECRET MIKE PHONES AND.
>> Stephen: IT'S AN EXCITING GAME.
MAYBE YOU SELL A LOT OF MEMORABILIA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE HIDING WITH THE KILL SWITCH?
>> HEAVEN KNOWS.
A LOT OF TIME IT'S NOT PROTECTING SECURITY IT'S PROTECTING PEOPLE'S REPUTATIONS
OR OTHER THINGS.
IT'S NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY THING.
ONE TIME A DETAINEE WROTE TO HIS ATTORNEY AND THE GOVERNMENT CLASSIFIED IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND
ALL IT SAID WAS LEBRON JAMES SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND FOR MOVE TOGETHER
MIAMI HEAVMENT IT IT TOOK TWO MONTHS TO DECLASSIFY THAT.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE WE NOT HEARING ABOUT THIS TRIAL?
THIS IS THE TRIAL OF CENTURY, DEFINITE IT WILL THE WAR OF CENTURY AND THIS IS THE GUY WHEN STARTED.
>> THESE ARE THE PEOPLE ACCUSED IN THE WORST CRIMES IN THE WORLD.
>> Steve: WHAT HAPPENS WITH GITMO FROM NOW ON.
150, 160 GUYS YOU.
IS IT STAND OUT PRISON.
ARE THEY THERE FOAMP NOW?
>> THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED SEVEN PEOPLE IN 11.5 YEARS AND EVEN THOSE CONVICTIONS HAVE
MOSTLY BEEN REVERSED.
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WILL STAY AND NOT BE TRIED WHICH IS THE REAL INJUSTICE.
THE VICTIMS OF 9/11 ZERVET TRIALS AND REAL TRIALS AND BEEF NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PULL IT OFF.
>> Stephen: IS IT JUST GOING TO TURN INTO A TERRORIST RETIREMENT SNOAM.
>> LOOKS LIKE --
>> Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LOCATION.
>> IT IS.
