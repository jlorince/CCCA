[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: FANTASTIC.
THAT IS AMAZING.
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, I GOT TO COMPLIMENT YOU.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD... I HAVE
NEVER HEARD SUCH MINDLESS
CHANTING WITH MILITARY
PRECISION.
FOLKS, LIKE EVERYONE IN THE
WORLD, I HAVE SO MUCH SYMPATHY
FOR RUPERT MURDOCH.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST LOOK AT THAT SAD, I'M GOING
THE SAY FACE.
WELL, THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD"
PHONE HACKING SCANDAL HAS BEEN
DISASTROUS FOR POOR RUPI.
HE'S HAD TO SHUT DOWN HIS MOST
PROFITABLE U.K. PAPER, TOP
EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND
NEWS CORP LOST $7 BILLION OF
MARKET VALUE IN FOUR DAYS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF FOX NEWS HAD THE MAKE SOME
BUDGET CUTS.
[LAUGHTER]
GET READY FOR THEIR NEW MORNING
SHOW, ""FOX AND FURNITURE".
NOW, YESTERDAY MURDOCH WAS
HAULED BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY
COMMITTEE TO HAVE HIS BANGERS
MASHED WHEN THE UNTHINKABLE
HAPPENED.
>> A MAN IDENTIFIED AS ACTIVIST
AND COMEDIAN JOHNNY MARVEL
CHARGED RUPERT MURDOCH WITH A
SHAVING CREAM PIE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: ACTIVIST AND
COMEDIAN?
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
YOU CAN'T USE COMEDY TO MAKE
POLITICAL POINTS.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, THANK GOD THE ATTACK WAS
DEFLECTED BY THIS WOMAN.
MURDOCH'S BEAUTIFUL ADOPTINGED
CHINESE WIFE WENDI.
FOLKS, I WAS HORRIFIED.
HE IS 80.
HE CAN'T DIGEST PIE.
BUT THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE
INSTANT MURDOCH WAS HIT WITH
THAT PIE, NEWS CORP STOCK
SPIKED, REGAINING $395 MILLION
IN MARKET VALUE IN FIVE MINUTES.
APPARENTLY THE PIE-ING HUMANIZED
MURDOCH.
LISTEN TO HOW THE MEETING ENDED.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
AGAIN FOR THE WHOLLY
UNACCEPTABLE TREATMENT YOU
RECEIVED FROM A MEMBER OF THE
PUBLIC.
>> Stephen: HIS PAPER SPIED ON
A MURDER GIRL AND THEY'RE
APOLOGIZEING TO HIM.
IT'S THIS IS BRILLIANT.
HE NEEDS TO BE HIT WITH MORE
PIES.
NOW, FOLKS, THIS IS ENGLAND, SO
PERHAPS A SCALDING MINCEMEAT OR
A SAVORY STEAK AND KIDNEY OR A
SNOUT AND PANCREAS BECAUSE
CLEARLY THIS WORKS.
EVEN THE SHARKS CELEBRATING
MURDOCH'S DOWNFALL FELT BAD FOR
HIM.
>> YOU CAN'T HELP FEEL A LITTLE
SORRY FOR THE GUY.
HE'S 80 YEARS OLD.
>> I WAS SADDENED TODAY.
HE'S 80 YEARS OLD.
HE LOOK AS IF SOMEONE HAS COME
ACROSS HIM WITH A CRICKET BAT.
>> Stephen: MY GOD, THAT'S
PERFECT.
I'VE GOT TO THINK OUTSIDE THE
PIE.
WHAT ELSE COULD WE HIT HIM WITH?
HOW ABOUT A SHOT TO THE NUTS
WITH A SOCCER BALL?
COME ON, HE GETS SYMPATHY AND IT
WOULD BE FUNNY.
NOT ACTIVIST COMEDIAN FUNNY, BUT
