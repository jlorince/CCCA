( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  NATION, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
FOLKS WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING USTONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCHTHIS SHOW-- AND I HOPE YOU DO--
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT ILOVE SAYING, IT'S "I TOLD YOU
SO."
OH, GOD, THAT FELT GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )SEE, I TOLD YOU SO.
OH!
THERE IT IS AGAIN!
WHAT A RUSH.
AND, FOLKS, TODAY THE YOU I'M SOTELLING IS BARACK OBAMA.
YOU SEE, FOR YEARS THE PRESIDENTHAS BEEN DRAGGING HIS FEET ON
BUILDING THE KEYSTONE X-LPIPELINE WHICH WOULD DRASTICALLY
INCREASE OUR NATION'S SUPPLY OFOIL AS WELL AS OUR NATION'S
SUPPLY OF PIPE.
NOW, FOR A WHILE OBAMA INSISTEDHE COULDN'T COMPLETE THE PROJECT
BECAUSE THE NATION'S BESTPIPE FITTERS WERE BUSY SAVING
PRINCESS PEACH.
THEM HE CLAIMED HE COULDN'TAPPROVE ANYTHING UNTIL HE GOT
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTREPORT.
LAST WEEK HIS STRATEGIC EXCUSERESERVE RAN DRY.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOUND THATTHE PIPELINE WOULDN'T HURT THE
ENVIRONMENT LIKE PROPPONENTSCLAIM.
>> THE PIPELINE ONLY HAVE AMINIMUM IMPACT ON CARBON
EMISSIONS.
>> Stephen:  MINIMUM IMPACT.
BOTTOM LINE, THE PIPELINE WILLPROVIDE US WITH MUCH NEEDED
FOSSIL FUELS.
SPEAKING OF FOSSILS, BILLO'REILLY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOUWERE WATCHING, BUT ON SUPER BOWL
SUNDAY, BILL SAT DOWN WITH THEPRESIDENT AND DID WHAT THE
BRONCOS COULDN'T-- HE SCOREDPOINTS.
( LAUGHTER )JIM.
>> ALL RIGHT, KEYSTONE X-LPIPELINE, NEW STUDY COMES IN,
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT NEGLIGIBLE.
42,000 JOBS.
YOU'RE GOING TO OKAY IT, IASSUME.
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT42,000.
THAT'S NOT CORRECT.
IT'S A COUPLE OF THOUSAND TOBUILD THE PIPELINE.
>> 42 ALL TOLD.
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHO WE'REGOING TO DO, THE PROCESS NOW
GOES-- AGENCIES COMMENT ON WHATTHE STATE DEPARTMENT DID, THE
PUBLIC IS ALLOWED TO COMMENT,KERRY'S GOING TO GIVE ME A
RECOMMENDATION -->> SO I ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO DO
THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS.
>> WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
>> OKAY, I'LL TAKE THAT AS AYES.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  YOU HEARDPRESIDENT O'REILLY.
HE SAID YES TO THE KEYSTONE X-LPIPELINE, THAT'S WHY I LOVE
BILL.
HE'S NOT ONLY ASKING THEHARD-HITTING QUESTIONS.
HE'S PROVIDING THE HARD-HITTINGANSWERS.
( LAUGHTER )AND PAPA BEAR IS RIGHT, FOLKS
THE PRESIDENT'S OWN STUDY SAYSTHE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IS
NEGLIGIBLE, BECAUSE MOST OFALBERTA'S OIL WILL FIND A WAY TO
GET TO MARKET ANYWAY, IF NOT BYPIPELINE, BY RAIL.
IT IS INEVITABLE.
IF SOMETHING IS INEVITABLE, THENAMERICA SHOULD BE THE ONE TO DO
IT.
( APPLAUSE )CASE IN POINT-- THESE PEOPLE GET
IT-- CASE IN POINT, ISN'T ITINEVITABLE THAT THE ICE CAPS
WILL MELT SO I SAY WE DROWN THEPOLAR BEARS IN THE SAN DIEGO
ZOO.
WE CHARGE PEOPLE A COUPLE OFBUCKS A HEAD TO WATCH AND GIVE
THE MONEY TO THE WORLD WILDLIFEFUND AND THEY CAN USE IT TO SAVE
THE POLAR BEARS.
OTHERWISE, THOSE GUYS AREDOOMED.
