[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING SEE IT --
STEPHEN]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, FRIENDS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WITH AN ARMY LIKE YOU AT MY
BACK, I'M READY TO GO TO BATTLE
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND IT'S TIME TO MARCH AGAIN
BECAUSE THERE'S NO GETTING
AROUND IT, FOLKS WE'VE GOT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.
LAST NIGHT'S STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS.
BIG WHUP-IDITDO.
WHAT TYPE OF NARCISSISTIC JERK
EXPECTS PEOPLE TO TUNE IN TO
HEAR A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE
MINDLESSLY CHEER HIM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT IS PATHETIC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO HERE SMOKES POT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHY I
SUBJECT MYSELF TO LAST NIGHT'S
SOCIALIST STROKE JOB BECAUSE IT
WAS MORE OF THE SAME OLD, SAME
OLD NEW IDEAS.
IT WAS NOTHING BUT A NOTHING
BURGER WITH ALL THE FIXINS.
LAUGH STILL NOTHING BURGER
PRETTY TASTY IF YOU SMOKE WEED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PATHETIC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOLKS, IT JUST CONFIRMED HOW
OUT OF TOUCH THE PRESIDENT IS.
>> SIMPLE FACT, THE MORE
EDUCATION YOU'VE GOT, THE MORE
LIKELY YOU ARE TO HAVE A GOOD
JOB AND WORK YOUR WAY TO THE
MIDDLE CLASS.
A RISING LIVE ITING MIDDLE
CLASS, MIDDLE CLASS.
>> Jon: MIDDLE CLASS, REALLY
GRANDPA?
WE HAVEN'T HAD A MIDDLE CLASS
SINCE THE 90s.
WHAT IS YOUR NEXT BIG IDEA
TRAVEL AGENCIES THAT ADVERTISE
ON CASSETTE TAPES.
YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY WITH
THE MIDDLE CLASS TALK.
THIS SPEECH WAS ABOUT ONE THING
ONLY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES THE
GOVERNMENT IS THE SOLUTION, MORE
GOVERNMENT.
>> BIG GOVERNMENT.
>> BIG GOVERNMENT.
>> BIG GOVERNMENT.
>> THIS IS THE MOST
PROGOVERNMENT SPEECH SINCE
LYNDON JOHNSON.
>> Stephen: YES, I FIND IT
OFFENSIVE THAT THE HEAD OF OUR
GOVERNMENT WOULD GIVE A SPEECH
TO EVERYONE ELSE IN THE
GOVERNMENT THAT WAS SO
PRO-GOVERNMENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT TO MENTION, THE PRESIDENT
IMMEDIATELY DECLARED WAR ON THE
PRIVATE SECTOR.
>> TONIGHT, LET'S DECLARE THAT
IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON
EARTH, NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL
TIME SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN
POVERTY AND RAISE THE FEDERAL
MINIMUM WAGE TO $9 AN HOUR.
>>
>> Stephen: $9?
THAT IS ALMOST TWO FEET OF
SANDWICH.
WHERE DOES IT END?
WHERE DID IT END?
A LIVING WAGE SPOILS THE WORKING
MAN.
JUST ASK C.E.O. AND FOX NEWS
RESIDENT SMEAGOL ROBERT LUDDY.
JIM?
>> I WORKED FOR $85 CENTS AN
HOUR WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE THAT
JOB.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING.
AMERICA HAS GONE SOFT.
IF EVERYONE IS LIVING THE
FANTASY LIFE OF COLD AND HEAT
THEY'LL HAVE NO DRIVE.
IT'S THAT SUFFERING THAT LIFTS
PEOPLE UP TO START THEIR OWN
BUSINESS AND ONE DAY BECOME A
JOB CREATOR LIKE MR. LUDDY WHO
LOBBIES TO FIGHT AGAINST RAISING
THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE HE WAS
SO (bleep) POOR HE HAD TO
FIGHT OFF RATS WITH A SPAT LA.
WHO IS INFECTED WITH RABIES.
YES, YOU ARE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BESIDES, PRESIDENT IF I DFIDE --
FIDEL HANDOUT HERE SAID NOTHING
ABOUT RAISING THE MAXIMUM WAGE.
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER
EARNING MORE THAN I CAN EVER
NEED BUT FOLKS CAN I IMAGINE
EVEN MORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, THAT WASN'T HIS ONLY
SHOCK JOBS PROGRAM.
>> TONIGHT I PROPOSE A FIX-IT
FIRST PROGRAM TO PUT PEOPLE TO
WORK ON THE MOST URGENT REPAIRS,
LIKE THE NEARLY 70,000
STRUCTURALLY DEOFFICIAL
BRIDGES -- DEFICIENT BRIDGES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: WOW, 70,000
STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT DEATH
TRAPS.
ON YOUR WAY TO YOUR NEW MINIMUM
WAGE JOB YOU WANT TO TAKE THE
ALTERNATE ROUTE AROUND THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER THROUGH
CANADA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THE BIGGEST -- I BELIEVE THE
THE BIGGEST FAILURE OF THE NIGHT
WAS HOW A BALMA KEPT UNLOADING
HIS WORK TO US.
>> WE MUST DO MORE TO COMBAT
CLIMATE CHANGE.
AMERICA MUST FACE THE THREAT OF
SIGNER ATTACKS.
AMERICA MUST REMAIN A BEACON TO
ALL WHO SEEK FREEDOM.
WE MUST ALL DO OUR PART.
WE CAN GET IT DONE.
NOW IS THE TIME TO GET IT DONE.
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT.
>> Jon: UG.
>> Stephen: UHG.
ARRGH.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK,
MAN.
WHY DO WE -- WHY DO WE ALWAYS
HAVE TO FACE OUR GLOBAL
CHALLENGES?
WHY CAN'T AMERICA TAKE A
PERSONAL YEAR?
JUST SOME TIME TO GET OUR
(bleep) TOGETHER.
MAYBE FOCUS ON OUR MUSIC,
THROARN HOME BREW?
-- LEARN TO HOME BREW?
WHATEVER.
NO, NO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO, WHATEVER.
