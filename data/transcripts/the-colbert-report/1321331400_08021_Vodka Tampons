(LAUGHTER)
>> PLUS MY FON TAN EL ISN'T
CLOSED EITHER.
NOW THAT YOU HAVE A CHILD,
JAY, I ALSO NEED TO SHARE
WITH YOU MY WISDOM AS A
FATHER.
BEING A PARENT IS A SUBLIME
AND BEAUTIFUL ADVENTURE.
FILLED WITH UNEXPECTED JOYS
AND UNIMAGINABLE TERROR.
I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED
SLEEPING, JAY, BECAUSE AS A
PARENT, THE REST OF YOUR
NIGHTS WILL BE HAUNTED BY
LOCAL NEWS STORIES LIKE
THIS.
>> A FEW THINGS I NEVER
THOUGHT WOULD APPEAR IN THE
SAME SENTENCE, TAMPONS AND
VODKA.
DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?
>> Stephen: YES.
YES, YOU DO.
>> BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A
PARENT, YOU REALLY NEED TO
HEAR THIS.
>> OFFICER CHRIS THOMAS
SPENDS HIS DAYS PATROLLING
THE HAULS OF VALLEY HIGH
SCHOOL.
HE HEARD FIRSTHAND HOW KIDS
ARE GET BE TIPSY.
>> WHAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT
IS TEENAGERS UTILIZING
TAMPONS SOAK THEM IN VODKA
FIRST BEFORE USING THEM.
>> YOU HEARD RIGHT, TEENS
TAKING TAMPONS, SOAKING THEM
IN VODKA, AND INSERTING THEM
THERE.
>> THIS IS NOT ISOLATED TO
ANY SCHOOL, ANY CITY, ANY
FINANCIAL AREA.
THIS IS EVERYWHERE.
>> Stephen: YES.
THIS IS HAPPENING AND IT IS
EVERYWHERE.
A HIGH SCHOOL SECURITY COP
HEARD ABOUT IT, THAT MEANS
IT'S TRUE.
NATION, I HAVE WARNED YOU
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE DANGERS
OF VODKA EYEBALLING.
A TERRIFYING TREND THAT
SWEPT THROUGH AMERICA'S
TEENS A YEAR AGO AND THEN
VANISHED COMPLETELY AS IF NO
ONE WAS REALLY DOING IT.
BUT VODKA TAMPONING IS EVEN
MORE THREATENING.
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THIS HAS
BEEN GOING ON.
NO WONDER THE WOMEN IN THESE
COMMERCIALS LOOK SO HAPPY!
THEY ARE HAMMERED!
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, I WISH, I WISH I
COULD SAY THAT THIS PRACTICE,
THAT IS, AGAIN, EVERYWHERE
IN AMERICA--
(LAUGHTER)
>> IS LIMITED TO TEENAGE
GIRLS.
BUT IF KPHO PHOENIX'S NEWS
LEADER REPORTS THIS
PHENOMENON IS EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY.
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT
JUST GIRLS.
GUYS WILL USE USE IT AND NOW
THEY'LL INSERT THEM INTO
THEIR RECTUM.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
OFFICER.
AGAIN, PARENTS, EVERYWHERE
IN AMERICA.
BOYS ARE SOAKING TAMPONS IN
VODKA AND LITTLE RATLY
GETTING DRUNK OFF THEIR
ASSES.
EVERYONE -- EVERY ONE!
WAKE UP!
WAKE UP, AMERICA.
EVERYONE IS DOING THIS.
IF YOU ARE WITH A TEENAGE
BOY RIGHT NOW, CHANCES ARE
THEY HAVE A VODKA SOAKED
TAMPON IN THEIR BUTT!
COME ON!
A VERY IMPORTANT ADVISORY TO
MY TEENAGE VIEWERS.
DO NOT DO THIS!
IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND
FOREGOD'S SAKE, IF YOU SOAK
YOUR TAMPON IN AT THE QEEL A,
DON'T SALT-- IN
