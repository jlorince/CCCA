>> LET ME SHARE ONE STORY.
HER NAME IS CARMEN. SHE LIVES INA HOTEL ROOM IN AUSTIN.
SHE HAS A 15-YEAR-OLD AND AN
11-YEAR-OLD THAT CAME UP FROM ELSALVADOR.
HARROWING TRIP.
SHE SAID THERE ARE TWO REASONSSHE BROUGHT THEM UP.
I THINK HER STORY ISREPRESENTATIVE.
ONE, SHE HADN'T HUGGED THEM INSEVEN YEARS.
>> Stephen: SHE WAS ALREADYHERE.
>> SHE WAS ALREADY HERE.
SHE HAD BEEN UP HERE SEVENYEARS.
>> SHE'S ONE OF THELOS ILLEGALES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO SHE'S ACRIMINAL.
SHE BROKE THE LAW AND SHE WANTEDHENCHMEN.
GO AHEAD.
I'M NOT THE MONSTER HERE.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT THEMONSTER HERE.
SO LET ME GET TO THE SECONDREASON.
GO AHEAD.
SHE WANTED TO HUG HER CHILDREN.
>> SHE WANTED HER CHILDREN WITHHER.
SECONDLY, THEY WERE FACING AHORRIFIC SITUATION IN SAN
SALVADOR.
THEY WERE BEING PREYED ON BYCRIMINAL GANGS.
THEY APPROACHED THEM AND SAID,CALL YOUR MOM AND GIVE US $2,500
OR WE'RE GOING TO KILL THE BOYS.
THIS IS THE KIND OF CRIMINALITYTHAT THESE YOUNGSTERS ARE
ESCAPING.
>> Stephen: WHY IS ITHAPPENING NOW, BECAUSE NEWS
FLASH, IT HASN'T BEEN ALL THATNICE IN THOSE COUNTRIES FOR
ABOUT 30 YEARS.
IT WAS SO CRAPPY IN GUATEMALAAND HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR
THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HELPEDTHEM BY FUNDING DEATH SQUADS.
THAT WAS BETTER.
>> WELL, CENTRAL AMERICANIMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN COMING UP
FOR A LONG TIME, AND THIS WAVEOF UNACCOMPANIED KIDS, MANY OF
THEM ARE TEENAGERS, IS REALLYCOMING UP FOR TWO AND A HALF
YEARS SOME IT'S BEEN PEAKING INTHE LAST --
>> Stephen: THAT'S VERYIMPORTANT.
TEENAGERS.
WE'RE NOT TALKING -- JUST FORTHE SAKE OF MY PUBLIC IMAGE,
LET'S JUST SAY THAT I'M ONLYCOMPLAINING ABOUT THE TEENAGERS,
BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES TEENAGERS.
OKAY.
OR LIKE THE BRATTY TWEENS, THOSEGUYS, DADDY, I DON'T WANT TO BE
TAKEN AWAY BY THE ARMED REBELS.
OKAY.
I WANT A NEW COUNTRY. GET ME ONENOW.
AND A PONY.
WHY IS OBAMA DOING THIS?
WHY DID HE INSTITUTE THISPOLICY?
WHY DID HE INSTITUTE THIS POLICYWHERE WE DON'T SEND THE KIDS
BACK.
>> IT'S NOT OBAMA'S POLICY.
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
>> THE POLICY BY WHICHUNACCOMPANIED MINORS ARE BEING
DETAINED AT THE BORDER ANDDELIVERED TO THEIR RELATIVES IN
THE STATES IS UNDER IMMIGRATIONPOLICY THAT BEGAN UNDER GEORGE
W. BUSH AND PREVIOUS REGIMES.
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD.
