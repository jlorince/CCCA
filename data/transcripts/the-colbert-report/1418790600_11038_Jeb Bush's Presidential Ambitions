TOMORROW, WHO KNOWS?
( LAUGHTER )AND FOR A SECOND, IT LOOKED LIKE
ENDING MY SHOW IN 2014 WOULDKEEP ME FROM COVERING THE 2016
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT'S ONLYTRUE IF I CARE ABOUT BEING
ACCURATE.
( LAUGHTER )AND LUCKILY FOR ME, 2016 CAME
EARLY THIS YEAR.
>> BREAKING NEWS JUST IN, JEBBUSH MAKING IT OFFICIAL-- WELL,
OFFICIALLY EXPLORING A RUN FORPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> HE HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVELYEXPLORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN
2016.
>> JEB BUSH IS TWEETING AS WESPEAK.
HE JUST TWEETED, "I AM EXCITEDTO ANNOUNCE I WILL ACTIVELY
EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OFRUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES."
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, JEB"NO W" BUSH HAS NOW FORMED A
PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORYCOMMITTEE, WHICH MAKES TWO IF
YOU COUNT THE ONE HE WAS BORNINTO.
( LAUGHTER )EXCUSE ME, I'M-- I'M JUST
GETTING A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIVE TO SEEAMERICA'S FIRST THIRD BUSH
PRESIDENT.
( LAUGHTER )AND THIS IS A HUGE RELIEF,
FOLKS, BECAUSE JEB HAS BEENTEASING US ABOUT RUNNING FOR
YEARS.
AFTER THE 2012 ELECTIONS, HECRUSHED OUR DREAMS SAYING HE'D
MISSEDS HIS WINDOW OFOPPORTUNITY BECAUSE 2012 HAD
BEEN HIS TIME.
THEN LAST NOVEMBER, HE LIFTEDTHE NATION'S HOPES, PROMISING
"I'M GOING TO NOT THINK ABOUT ITUNTIL THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR.
THEN I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT ITREALLY HARD."
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
YEAH.

( CHEERS )I MEAN, I MEAN, THINK REALLY
HARD?
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARDA BUSH SAY THAT?
( LAUGHTER )NOW, IT TURNS OUT ALL THIS TIME
JEB WAS JUST WORKING THROUGH THEFIVE STAGES OF RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT-- DENIAL, THINKING,ACCEPTANCE OF MONEY FROM DONORS,
VACATIONING IN IOWA, AND THENTHE FINAL TRAGIC STAGE,
PANCAKES.
( LAUGHTER )RUN, JEB, RUN.
