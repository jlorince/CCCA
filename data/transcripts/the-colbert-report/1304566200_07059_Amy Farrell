I COULD LISTEN TO YOU DO THAT
ALL NIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT WANTS US
TO STOP STIGMATIZING FAT PEOPLE.
I'LL ASK HER IF MY ASS LOOKS
STIGMATIZED IN THIS SUIT.
PLEASE WELCOME AMY FARRELL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE A
PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN STUDIES
AND WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
AT DICKINSON COLLEGE IN
PENNSYLVANIA.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW
BOOK CALLED "FAT SHAME" STIGMA
AND THE FAT BODY IN AMERICAN
CULTURE.
>> VERY GOOD.
THAT'S IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SO FEW GUESTS
PRAISE MY READING.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M LOOKING AT A.
>> I TEACH READING AND WRITING.
>> Stephen: DO YOU REALLY?
IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR FAT
PEOPLE?
IT'S A PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF
AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: A LOT OF AMERICANS
ARE A LITTLE OVERWEIGHT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: YOU, TO ME YOU
DON'T SEEM QUALIFIED TO WRITE
THIS BOOK BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
FAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, THE POINT IS I THINK
THAT ALL OF US MAYBE HAVE AN
INNER FAT PERSON LURKING INSIDE
OF US.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING?
>> AS IN WE'RE ALL --
>> Stephen: JUST SAY IT.
YOU THINK I'M FAT.
>> INCLUDING YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: FANTASTIC.
>> WE'RE ALL ANXIOUS ABOUT FAT
IN OUR CULTURE.
WE LIVE IN A CULTURE OF FAT.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO LOSE
WEIGHT ESPECIALLY NOW SUMMER IS
COMING, RIGHT?
PEOPLE ARE IN A PANIC IT'S MAY
ALREADY.
I HAVE TO GET DOWN TO MY 32'S.
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WE HAVE A HUGE DIET INDUSTRY, A
$60 BILLION DIET INDUSTRY THAT
REINFORCES THAT IDEA THAT WE'RE
NOT A SUFFICIENT PERSON IF WE'RE
NOT THIN.
IF WE'RE THIN WE'RE SUPERIOR AND
IF WE'RE FAT WE'RE AN INFERIOR
PERSON.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY THAT THE
DIET INDUSTRY REINFORCES THE
IDEA.
DON'T WE REINFORCE THE DID THE
INDICT INDUSTRY?
THE MARKET IS WINNING.
I EAT THE FAT FREE FIGURE
NEWTONS.
I EAT THE -- THAT'S ALL I EAT IS
THE FAT FREE FIGURE NEWTONS --
FIG NEWTONS.
I MARKET SAYS I SHOULD GET
THINNER.
>> THE DIET INDUSTRY WORKS WITH
THE CULTURE WHICH KNOWS IT'S BAD
TO BE FAT.
I SAY THAT WITH THE LITTLE MARKS
AROUND IT.
>> Stephen: TWO LITTLE BUNNIES
RIGHT THERE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S AN IDEA THAT HAS GAINED
STRENGTH IN THE LAST 120 YEARS.
>> Stephen: IT WAS NOT ALWAYS
A STIGMA TO BE FAT.
>> FAT USED TO BE A SIGN OF
WEALTH AND REALLY IT WASN'T
UNTIL MORE PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE
AND MIDDLE CLASS ABLE WERE ABLE
TO BECOME FAT, WERE ABLE TO PUT
FAT ON OUR PODDIES THAT --
BODIES THAT IT BECAME A CULTURAL
PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: THAT'S HOW YOU
HAVE A CHESTER A. ARTHUR OR TAFT
, SUPERFAT PRESIDENT.
OBAMA COULD SLIP THROUGH THE
FENCE AT THE ZOO.
>> IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR A
CANDIDATE TO BE BECOME PRESIDENT
IF HE OR SHE WERE FAT,
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: HUCKABEE IS OUT.
NEWT GINGRICH HAS A FEW POUNDS
ON HEM.
>> THEY SAY IT'S A PROBLEM.
IT STARTED EARLIER IN THE
COUNTRY'S HISTORY.
EVEN PRESIDENT CLEVELAND WHEN HE
WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT PEOPLE
WROTE EDITORIALS ABOUT HIM BEING
FAT AND IT WAS A SIGN OF HIS
CHARACTER THAT IT WAS SOMEHOW A
SIGN.
IN THE 19th CENTURY PEOPLE
WOULD STUDY PWOD SIGNS FOR YOUR
CHARACTER.
THE SIZE OF YOUR EAR MIGHT SHOW
YOU HAD CRIMINAL TENDENCIES.
IF YOU WERE THIN, SUPPOSEDLY IT
WAS A SIGN YOU HAD ARISTOCRATIC
BACKGROUND AND IF YOU WERE FAT,
WITH YOUR MORE PRIM STEF.
>> Stephen: A MURDERER.
>> NOT NECESSARILY BUT A
PROSTITUTE.
>> Stephen: FAT WOMEN WERE
PROSTITUTES?
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT FAT WOMEN
WERE PROSTITUTES.
>> Stephen: FAT MEN WERE
PROSTITUTES?
WHO WAS THE PROSTITUTE?
>> THERE WAS A FEAR THAT FAT MEN
WERE A SIGN OF HOMOSEXUALITY,
ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: GROVER CLEVELAND
WAS GAME THAT'S THE NEWS YOU ARE
BREAKING RIGHT NOW.
THAT IS A STEREOTYPICALLY GAY
NAME:  GROVER.
>> YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TURN YOUR
MIND WILL TAKE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU TEACH FAT
STUDIES?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH BEING
FAT?
TO ARE THERE HEALTH ISSUES?
YOU CALL THE A CIVIL RIGHTS
ISSUE.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T
GO TO THE GYM AND WORK OFF YOUR
BLACKNESS, RIGHT?
>> THERE'S AN ANALOGY THERE THAT
WHAT IS WRONG WITH FAT PEOPLE IS
THE FATNESS AND THEY NEED TO GET
RID OF THE FAT.
AS A FAT PERSON IS LIVING IN A
CULTURE OF SHAME.
>> Stephen: AS A PEOPLE WE'RE
GETTING FATTER.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE WORD FAT?
>> I'M FINE WIT.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING
WRONG WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE
WE'RE GETTING FATTER AS A
PEOPLE?
>> THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THE
HORRIBLE ANXIETY AND HYSTERIA WE
HAVE OVER IT.
PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT HAVE
BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT THAN
PEOPLE UNDERWEIGHT.
>> Stephen: I KNOW THEY CAN
TAKE A BULLET.
>> IT'S A HORRIBLE STIGMATIZED
IDEA THOUGH.
>> Stephen: I'M COMPLIMENTING
THEM.
>> SOMEHOW IT'S FUNNY TO THINK
ABOUT A FAT PERSON TAKING A
BULLET OR A FAT PERSON ISN'T
NECESSARILY WORTHY OF THE SAME
KIND OF CARE AND ATTENTION AS A
THIN PERSON.
>> Stephen: THEY DESERVE THE
SAME AMOUNT OF CARE BUT IT'S
FURTHER TO THE ORGAN.
IT'S A FACT, IS IT NOT?
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GO THERE.
>> Stephen: I'LL GO THERE
WITHOUT YOU.
