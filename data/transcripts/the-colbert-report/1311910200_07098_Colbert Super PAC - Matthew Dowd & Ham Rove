THEIR PARENTS DON'T LET THEM
WATCH.
GET IT TOGETHER, COLBERT.
GET IT TOGETHER.
WE'RE FACED WITH A HEADY
DECISION, JUST TURN TO THE
MAN WITH THE MOST HEAD.
KARL ROVE.
KARL IS THE FOUNDER OF THE
COUNTRY'S LARGEST SUPERPAC,
AMERICAN CROSSROADS.
UNFORTUNATELY, I COULDN'T
REACH KARL ROVE.
I CAN NEVER QUITE DRAW THE
PENT GRAM-- PENTAGRAM RIGHT.
SO INSTEAD PLEASE WELCOME
THE NEXT BEST THING TO KARL
ROVE, A PAIR OF GLASSES ON A
HAM LOAF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BEST PART OF HAVING HAM
ROVE ON, MY PAC CAN WRITE IT
OFF AS BOTH A POLITICAL
CONSULTANT AND CATERING.
HAM ROVE, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US.
KARL, NOW THAT I'VE GOT A
PAC, WHAT SHOULD I DO?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S SHY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER.
OVER DINNER.
LUCKILY I HAVE ANOTHER GUEST
EVEN BETTER THAN KARL ROVE.
PLEASE WELCOME ABC NEWS
POLITICAL ANALYST AND CHIEF
STRATEGIST FOR GEORGE W.
BUSH'S 2004 RE-ELECTION
CAMPAIGN, MATTHEW DOWD.
MATTHEW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT.
MATTHEW
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MATTHEW, THESE KIDS WANT TO
KNOW WHAT I STAND FOR, OKAY.
WHAT DO PACs USUALLY STAND
FOR LIKE AMERICANS FOR
PROSPERITY, WHAT DO THEY
STAND FOR?
>> WELL, IT COULD BE TAXES,
THERE'S LOWER TAXES.
IT COULD BE CHANGE THE LAWS
ON HEALTH-CARE REFORM.
IT'S ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES
BUT YOU HAVE TO STICK IT
OUT.
YOU CAN'T JUST STICK YOUR
FINGER IN THE WIND.
>> Stephen: WHERE SHOULD I
STICK MY FINGER BECAUSE IF
IT WILL HELP RAISE MONEY I
CAN THINK OF A FEW PLACES.
>> THAT MAY BE BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OR MY SIGNIFICANT DONOR.
BECAUSE LIKE KARL ROVE AND
AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY
THEY'VE GOT THESE
BILLIONAIRES WHO BANKROLL
THEM, RIGHT.
>> YEAH, WELL, MILLIONAIRES
AND SOME AVERAGE PEOPLE BUT
A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: AVERAGE
BILLIONAIRES SO, DO THOSE
BILLIONAIRES HELP SET THE
AGENDA?
>> OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE PART OF
IT AND THEY'RE INFLUENTIAL
IN THE PROCESS.
BUT IF SOMEBODY REALLY, LIKE
YOU STANDS FOR SOMETHING,
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE
INFLUENCED BY MONEY.
SOMETIMES THE MONEY HAS
INFLUENCE IN THE PROCESS.
>> Stephen: HERE IS THE
THING IS, I DON'T-- I
DON'T-- I DON'T HAVE LIKE
MILLIONAIRES OR BILLIONAIRES,
I ONLY HAVE THESE PEOPLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY
MORE POWER THAN THE
BILLIONAIRES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY.
WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T I ASK YOU PEOPLE
WHAT YOU STAND FOR AND THEN
COLBERT SUPERPAC WILL STAND
FOR THAT.
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
EVERYBODY IS A MEMBER OF
COLBERT SUPERPAC AND IF YOU
ARE NOT GO TO COLBERT
SUPERPAC.COM.
WE WILL SEND AN E-MAIL OR GO
TO SUPERPAC AND CLICK ON, I
STAND FOR, AND THAT WILL
TAKE TO YOU A PAGE WHERE YOU
CAN WRITE IN WHAT YOU STAND
FOR AND WE'LL HAVE THOSE
RESULTS NEXT WEEK, OKAY?
SOUND LIKE A GOOD IDEA?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> GREAT IDEA, GREAT IDEA.
>> Stephen: NOW OKAY.
NOW ONCE I FIGURE OUT WHAT I
STAND FOR WHAT DO THE PACS
DO?
>> WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS
ONCE YOU HAVE MONEY THAT YOU
ARE RAISING VERY WELL AND
YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU
STAND FOR, YOU WANT TO
COMMUNICATE WHAT YOUR
MESSAGE IS.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO TURN
THAT MONEY INTO SPEECH.
>> YOU WANT TO TURN THAT
MONEY INTO SPEECH WHETHER IT
IS CANDIDATE SPEECH, A
PERSON SPEAKING OR
TELEVISION ADS WHICH ARE AN
EFFECTIVE MEANS OF
COMMUNICATING YOUR MESSAGE
AND I WOULD SUGGEST, IF I
WERE ADVISING YOU-- .
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ADVISING
ME?
>> NO, I THINK I'M GOING TO
KEEP MY DAY JOB, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WERE ADVISING ME WHAT
WOULD YOU ADVISE?
>> I WOULD PUT TOGETHER SOME
ADS THAT REPRESENT WHAT YOU
WANT TO COMMUNICATE TO THE
VOTERS.
AND THEN FIGURE OUT GREAT
PLACES TO PUT THOSE.
>> Stephen: CAN THESE BE
JUST ABOUT ISSUES OR JUST
ABOUT PEOPLE?
>> IT CAN BE ANY NUMBER OF
THINGS.
YOU CAN DO AN AD THAT IS
STRAIGHT ON AN ISSUE.
IF YOU WANTED TO PUT AN AD
ABOUT TAXES OR WHATEVER IT
HAPPENED TO BE, OR IT COULD
BE AN AD FOR OR AGAINST
SOMEBODY.
>> Stephen: SHOULD I GO
NEGATIVE ON PEOPLE?
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO
SAY THAT'S NEGATIVE ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S TRUE
T SHOULD BE TRUE, WHAT YOU
SAY, THEN I WOULD, YOU KNOW,
GO WHERE YOUR HEART GOES.
>> Stephen: MY MOM ALWAYS
SAID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY,
YOU BETTER BACK IT UP WITH A
LOT OF MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHERE SHOULD I RUN THOSE
ADS.
IS THERE ANY BATTLEGROUND
COMING UP?
>> RIGHT NOW IN MY VIEW
BECAUSE OF THE A.M.S STRAW
VOTE HAPPENING IN A COUPLE
OF WEEKS, I WOULD GO TO IOWA
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE A LOT
OF PEOPLE WILL BE COVERING,
THE MEDIA, CANDIDATES TRYING
TO WIN THAT STRAW VOTE THAT
IS WHERE I WOULD DO THE ADS
N EYE IOWA.
>> Stephen: SO IF I WAS
GOING TO BE A PLAYER, MAKE
MY MARK IN IOWA.
>> YEAH, IF YOU WANT TO BE A
PLAYER, MAKE YOUR MARK IN
IOWA.
>> Stephen: WHATEVER THAT
MEANS.
OR PLAYA.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MATTHEW
DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL
ANALYST.
