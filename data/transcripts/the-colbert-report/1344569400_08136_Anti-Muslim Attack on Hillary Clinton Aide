>> WELCOME TO THE REPORT BEGUN EVERYBODY.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING OUNCE THIS BEAUTIFUL EVENING.
IF YOU ARE A LONGTIME VIEWER OF THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I WARNED YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SECRET
MUSLIMS LURKING ALL AROUND US.
I'M ON TO YOU AL-OBAMA.
THAT WHY I ADMIRE MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN AND AMATEUR HIP KNOW TIFT MICHELE BACHMANN FOR
HER BRAVE ATTEMPT TO ROOT OUT MUSLIM EXTREMISTS FROM OUR GOVERNMENT.
THIS PAST JUNE, SHE AND ALONG WITH FELLOW REPUBLICANS, A GROUP OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE MENSA
OF CONGRESS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- SENT A LETTER TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALLEGING THAT RECENT EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENTAL
DECISION APPEARED TO BE A RESULT OF INFLUENCE OPERATIONS CONDUCTED BY INDIVIDUALS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
IN OTHER WORDS:  MUSLIMS HAVE INFILTRATING OUR GOVERNMENT.
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE CAFETERIA SERVES CRESCENT ROLLS?
THAT IS NOTHING MORE THAN WARM BUTTERY JIHAD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, FOLKS, THESE ACCUSATIONS CAUSED A FIRESTORM BECAUSE ONE OF THE SUSPECTED INFILTRATORS IS
WIFE OF FORMER UNDERWEAR MODEL ANTHONY WIENER, TOP AIDE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND ADMITTED MUSLIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THESE CHARGES WERE MADE WITHOUT EVIDENCE AND DENOUNCED BY REPUBLICANS JOHN BOEHNER,
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND JOHN MCCAIN WHO TOOK TO THE FLOOR OF SENATE AND CALLED HER ACCUSATIONS
SPECIOUS AND DEGRADING BUT FORMER SPEAKER AND CURRENT NOT GOING TO BE PRESIDENT NEWT
GINGRICH DEFENDING BACHMANN ON THE CNN.
>> TO START RAISING THE ISSUES OF MCCARTYISM.
>> FIRST OF ALL THERE WERE REAL SPIES.
>> A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED.
>> AND A LOT OF GUILTY PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN UNCOVERED IF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE
THE COURAGE TO TAKE THEM ON.
>> STEPHEN: YES, IT TAKES A BRAVE NOON ACCUSE SOMEONE OF SOMETHING WITHOUT EVIDENCE AND
DEMAND THEY REFUTE THE EVIDENCE YOU DON'T V. TONIGHT I'M ACCUSING NEWT GINGRICH OF BEING
A BABY EATING WEREWOLF.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THERE IT IS.
IT'S OUT THERE NOW.
DO I HAVE EVIDENCE, NO BUT SOMEONE HAS TO STAND UP TO HIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE DO I FIND
