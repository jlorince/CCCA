[LAUGHTER]
NATION, I'M IN NO POSITION TO
JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE.
NOW I AM.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, WHOEVER GETS THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IS GOING
TO WORK HARD TO OVERTURN OBAMA
OBAMACARE.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE SICK
OUT THERE, SO WHAT DO WE DO?
LUCKILY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
RICK SANTORUM HAS THE RIGHT
PERSPECTIVE.
AT A RECENT CAMPAIGN STOP,
SANTORUM WAS ASKED HOW HE FEELS
ABOUT THE "50,000 AMERICANS WHO
DIE EVERY YEAR WITH NO HEALTH
CARE."
WELL, RICK LOOKED DEEP INSIDE
AND SAID, "I REJECT THAT NUMBER
COMPLETELY, THAT PEOPLE DIE IN
AMERICA BECAUSE OF LACK OF
HEALTH INSURANCE.
PEOPLE DIE IN AMERICA BECAUSE
PEOPLE DIE IN AMERICA."
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT LOGIC
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
THAT LOGIC.
BUT CLEARLY, FOLKS, THERE IS
STILL A PROBLEM WITH ALL THESE
PEOPLE DYING.
WHICH IS WHY I'M ISSUING A WAG
OF MY FINGER AT DEAD PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR DISRESPECTING THE SANCTITY
OF LIFE BY CHOOSING TO BE DEAD.
HEY, I GOT NOTHING AGAINST DEAD
PEOPLE.
I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF DEAD
PEOPLE.
HELL, SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS
ARE DEAD.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH, THE
DEAD NEED TO TAKE SOME PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
AS SANTORUM CONTINUED, PEOPLE
MAKE POOR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT
TO THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR HEALTH
CARE, AND THEY DON'T GO TO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM OR THEY DON'T GO
TO THE DOCTOR WHEN THEY NEED TO.
YET IF YOU'RE DYING OF CANCER,
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT FOR NOT
GOING TO THE DOCTOR, AND IF YOU
CAN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE, THEN
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT FOR NOT
HAVING A JOB.
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB
BECAUSE YOU'RE DYING OF CANCER,
GET YOURSELF TO A DOCTOR.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
OTHER...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OTHER THAN THE CANCER OBVIOUSLY.
[LAUGHTER]
WE HAVE A SERIOUS HEALTH CARE
PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY, FOLKS,
AND DEAD PEOPLE ARE NOT MAKING
IT ANY BETTER BY BURYING THEIR
HEADS AND THE REST OF THEM IN
THE SAND.
I SAY THESE SO-CALLED SICK
PEOPLE DYING JUST A WAY TO GET
US TO WANT OBAMACARE.
IT'S ALL A CONSPIRACY.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL THEM
"CEMETERY PLOTS"?
FINALLY, FOLKS, I HAVE HAD IT UP
TO HERE WITH OUR OVERLY
SENSITIVE, PRIME MINISTER C.
CULTURE, AND BUT UP TO HERE I
MEAN THE AVERAGE HEIGHT OF A
GUATEMALAN.
[LAUGHTER]
ABOUT RIGHT.
YEAH.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO ANGRY WHEN I
HEARD THIS:
>> PAPA JOHN'S PIZZERIA IN NEW
YORK FIRED THE CASHIER OVER THIS
RACIST RECEIPT.
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, YOU CAN
ACTUALLY SEE HOW AN ASIAN
AMERICAN CUSTOMER IS IDENTIFIED
AS "LADY CHINKY EYES."
>> Stephen: REALLY?
THEY FIRED THE CASHIER FOR THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
YES, SHE CALLED HER "CHINKY
EYE," BUT LADY CHINKY EYES.
THAT'S A SIGN OF RESPECT IN THE
ORIENT.
ALL PAPA JOHNS WAS TRYING TO DO
WAS MAKE SURE THE PIZZA GOT TO
THE RIGHT CUSTOMER.
IF THEY HADN'T PUTTEN LADY
CHINKY EYE, IT MIGHT HAVE ENDED
UP IN THE HANDS OF COUNTESS
TOTAL LESBO OR ADMIRAL SPIC
BUTT.
I'M GIVING A BIG TIP OF MY HAT
TO PAPA JOHN'S FOR PUTTING
SERVICE BEFORE SENSITIVITY.
CALLING HER LADY CHINKY EYES IS
NO MORE CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE
THAN CALLING PAPA JOHN'S ITALIAN
FOOD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BESIDES... THAT WAS GOOD.
THAT WAS GOOD.
BESIDES, MISS CHINKY EYES WAS
ASKING FOR IT.
JUST LOOK AT HER REAL NAME,
MINHEE CHO.
"MINHEE," REALLY?
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT'S NOT
PLAYING INTO THE
