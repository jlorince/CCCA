IF YOU WATCH THIS PROGRAM, AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU DO, YOU KNOW THAT IF NOTHING ELSE I'M A
COMPANY MAN.
AND I COULD NOT BE PROUDER THAT THIS SHOW IS A PROFITMAKING TSUNAMI FOR MY PARENT COMPANY VIACOM.

SCROTUM DIPS.

FRESH AS A DAISY, SIR.

SO WHEN CORPORATE CALLS AND SAYS, "STEVEO WE NEED A SPONSOR INTEGRATION FOR HALLS
MENTHOLYPTUS ON YOUR SHOW TONIGHT," I SAY, "AM I CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO?" THEY SAY, "YES."
I SAY, "THEN I LOVE IT."
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, I HAVE TO PROTECT MY REPUTATION AS A NEWSMAN.
I CAN'T BE SELLING MY NAME TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
SO INSTEAD I'M SELLING MY INTERN'S NAME.

NASAL PASSAGES THAT YOU CAN FEEL WHEN YOU TAKE A BREATH.
