>> Stephen:  FOLKS ALL ACROSS
AMERICA CITIES HAVE HAD ENOUGH
OF THESE OCCUPY MOVEMENTS AND
YESTERDAY TENSIONS IN SEATTLE
BUBBLED UP LIKE A PHONE A
MATCHIATO.
WE TURN TO KNBC.
>> CHAOT ERUPTS IN DOWNTOWN
SEATTLE AS OCCUPY PROTESTERS
TOOK OVER A MAJOR INTERSECTION.
POLICE MOVED IN WITH PEPPER
SPRAY.
DOZENS OF PROTESTERS WERE HIT,
INCLUDING THIS PREGNANT WOMAN.
AN 84-YEAR-OLD ELDERLY WOMAN WAS
ALL SPRAYED.
>> Stephen:  NOW, SPRAYING AN
84-YEAR-OLD WOMAN SOUNDS HARSH
UNTIL YOU LEARN THAT SHE WAS
FOUR FOOT 10.
SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN UNDERNEATH
THEIR GUARD AND PINCHED THEIR
CHEEKS OR PELTED THEM WITH A
WERTHERY ORIGINAL.
AND SOME HAVE CRITICIZED PEPPER
SPRAYING A PREGNANT WOMAN, BUT
DON'T FORGET THE COPS WERE
SPRAYING FOR TWO.
AND I DON'T SEE WHY THEY DIDN'T
CUFF THAT TINY PROTESTER
OCCUPYING HER WOMB.
JUST ANOTHER LAZY, DO-NOTHING
MOOCHING OFF THE SYSTEM.
FREE ROOM, FREE BOARD, AND FREE
MOZART FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS.
GET A JOB!
IVE SAY YOU GOT TIME TO GESTATE,
YOU GOT TIME TO COLLATE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
SO, FOLKS, CLEARLY,--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS GET IT.
( LAUGHTER )
SO NONE OF THIS WAS EXCESSIVE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
AS SEATTLE POLICE SPOKESMAN
EXPLAINED, THE SPRAY IS NOT AGE
SPECIFIC.
IT'S NO MORE DANGEROUS TO
SOMEONE WHO IS 10 OR SOMEONE WHO
IS 80.
YOU SEE, BEING AGONIZINGLY
BLINDED BY PEPPER SPRAY IS FUN
FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AND
PERFECTLY HARMLESS.
TO PROVE IT I'M GOING TO
DEMONSTRATE RIGHT HERE ON MY
SHOW.
JIMMY, SEND IN THE 10-YEAR-OLD
BOY.
COME ON IN.
( APPLAUSE )
DANNY, EVERYBODY.
GIVE IT UP
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, DANNY.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
>> HI, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, NOW, DANNY
ARE YOU READY TO GET PEPPER
SPRAYED?
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  DON'T WORRY, THE
SEATTLE POLICE SAY IT IS
HARMLESS TO PEPPER SPRAY A
10-YEAR-OLD BOY.
>> DO YOU HAVE TO?
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
UH, I WOULD DO IT TO A RABBIT
BUT THEN I'D HAVE PETA ON MY
ASS.
OKAY.
AND AFTER WE ARE DONE, I WILL
GIVE YOU THIS DELICIOUS GOGURT
AS A REWARD.
OKAY?
( LAUGHTER )
ALL RIGHT, NOW, DANNY, THIS IS
FIVE MILL SCOVILLE UNITS OF
CONCENTRATED CAPPIZATION.
ARE YOU ALLERGER TO PEPPER OIL?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen:  LET'S FIND OUT.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR GLASS OFF,
OKAY.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR GLASSES
OFF.
ARE YOU READY?
ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS?
ONE-- LEAN IN A LITTLE CLOSER--
TWO, THREE.
AAHHHH!
AAHHH!
AAHHHH!
I AM BLIND!
AAAH.
MY EYES!
HELP ME, DANNY.
OH, MY GOD!
MY EYES.
CUT MY EYEBALLS OUT!
OH, MY GOD!
MY EYEBALLS ARE RE-ENTERING THE
ATMOSPHERE!
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
I WISH I WERE DEAD!
DANNY, HELP ME.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
YES!
OH.
AHHH.
OH.
OH, THAT IS GOOD.
THAT IS GOOD.
>> AM I STILL GETTING A GOGURT.
>> Stephen:  WHAT?
>> AM I STILL GETTING A GOGURT?
>> Stephen:  NO, NO, I NEED
THIS ONE.
>> I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY
GOGURT.
>> Stephen:  YES YOU ARE!
GET OUT OF HERE!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, GAAAAH!
