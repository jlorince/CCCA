MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AWE THR
WHO IS WORKING TO SAVE
INDEPENDENT BOOK STORES.
INDEPENDENT BOOK STORES, I

AMAZON.
PLEASE WELCOME ANN PATCHETT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.

THE PEOPLE OUT THERE YOU ARE
RATHER IMPRESSIVE CV.
>> PLEASE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU THE
AUTHOR OF BATT FICTION AND
NONFICTION, INCLUDING VAL
CONTO, STATE OF WONDER, THE
PATIENT SAINT OF WIRES.
YOU WON THE PENN FAULKNER
AWARD FOR VAL CONTO THIS IS
THE SCANDALOUS PART.
YOU ARE THE CO-OWNER OF
PARNASSUS BOOKS IN NASHVILLE,
TENNESSEE.
YOU OPENED THIS UP WIDE.
WHY WOULD A WRITER OPEN A
BOOK STORE.
THAT IS LIKE A RODEO RIDER
OPENING A BUTCHER SHOP.
WHY WOULD YOU, WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT.
>> BECAUSE THEN I GET THE
ROYALTIES PLUS WHAT I MAKE
AT THE BOOK STORE.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE SCRATCH FOR YOU.
>> NO, BECAUSE BOTH OF OUR
BOOK STORES IN NASHVILLE
CLOSED.
WE HAD TWO HUGE BOOK STORES,
BOTH OVER 30,000 SQUARE FEET,
ONE AN INDEPENDENT, ONE A
BORDERS.
THEY BOTH CLOSED.
SUDDENLY I'M LIVING IN A
TOWN WITH NO BOOK STORE.
MY BOOK COMES OUT,
EVERYBODY'S CALLING ME,
WHERE I:I WOULD I YOUR BOOK,
THEY HAD TO GO TO THE ALTARATION
SHOP TO BUY MY BOOK.
>> Stephen: THE ALTERATION
SHOP.
>> THEY OFFERED TO SELL IT
FOR ME.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> TRULY.
>> Stephen: YOU PUT A HEM IN
YOUR DRESS AND ALSO GET A
COPY.
>> YOU COULD GO TO STITCH IT,
HAVE YOUR PANTS ALTERnd AND
GET A SIGNED COPY OF STATE
OF WONDER.
>> Stephen: STITCH IT DOES
GOOD WORK.
>> I LOVE THEM.
>> Stephen: WHY OPEN A BOOK
STORE BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS
SPOKEN, THERE WAS NO MARKET
IN YOUR TOWN FOR A BOOK
STORE.
YOU CAN GO TO AMAZON.
>> NO, THERE WAS.
BOTH OF THOSE BOOKS WERE
PROFITABLE.
BOTH OF THOSE STORES WERE
PROFITABLE.
EVERY MONTH THEY WERE OPEN.
THEY CLOSED AT CORPORATE
LEVEL.
SO THEY HAD LARGER ISSUES.
BUT NASHVILLIANS, WE ARE
GOOD BOOK-BUYING, SMART
TOWN.
WE WERE GOING IN AND FILLING
UP MORE THAN 60,000 SQUARE
FEET OF BOOK BUYING NEED
EVERY MONTH.
THEY CLOSED, AND WE ARE A
LITTLE STORE.
2500 SQUARE FEET.

>> Stephen: AND IN THAT TOM
HANKS CRUSHES MEG RYAN AND
THEN SHE FALLS IN LOVE WITH
HIM.
>> THAT WAS THE 80s.
THIS SI A WHOLE NEWERA.
WE'VE HAD THE CYCLE.
LITTLE BOOK STORES AS WELL T
GETS BIGGER.
CRUSHED BY THE SUPERSTORE,
BARNES & NOBLE BORDERS
CHAINS THEY WERE THEN
CRUSHED BY AMAZON AND NOW

SAVING A BOOK STORE MIGHT
EAT ITSELF.
