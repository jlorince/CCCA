WELCOME BACK.
NATION, YOU KNOW, MacGRUFF MAY TAKE A BITE OUT OF CRIME, BUT THE ALPHA DOG WILL TORTURE DRUG
DEALERS FOR INFORMATION.
THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK.
[BARKING]
THIS WEEK'S ALPHA DOG IS THE REVEREND GEORGE REKERS.
THIS MASTIFF OF MASCULINITY IS CO-FOUNDER WITH DR. JAMES DOBSON OF THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL.
AND HE'S ON THE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH AND THERAPY OF
HOMOSEXUALITY OR NARTH, WHICH IS DEDICATED TO TURNING GAY PEOPLE STRAIGHT AGAIN.
SO YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO THIS ALPHA DOG RECENTLY TOOK ON A TEN-DAY, ALL-EXPENSE-PAID TRIP
TO EUROPE UNLESS YOU GUESSED GAY MALE PROSTITUTE.
JIM?
>> HE WAS NOT AWARE THE ESCORTED WAS MALE PROSTITUTE AND THAT HE
HIRED HIM BECAUSE RECENT SURGERY LEFT HIM UNABLE TO LIFT HIS LUGGAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: TECHNICALLY I BELIEVE HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HOIST HIS SACKS.
AND LISTEN, LISTEN TO JUST WHERE HE FOUND HIS BAGGAGE HANDLER.
JIM?
>> GEORGE REKERS MET THE ESCORT THROUGH RENTBOY.COM.
>> Stephen: YES, RENT BOY.COM.
CLEARLY, FOLKS, THIS IS AN HONEST MISTAKE.
RENTBOY.COM LOOKS LIKE A WEB SITE WHERE YOU HIRE BELLHOPS.
[LAUGHTER]
THE MEN ARE ALL SHIRTLESS, SO YOU CAN SEE HOW BIG THEIR BAG-CARRYING MUSCLES ARE.
AND THERE ARE EVEN VIDEOS WHERE THESE RENT BOYS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE AT GRABBING AND YANKING
THINGS BY THE HANDLES.
NFTD, RENTBOY.COM IS WHERE I GOT A LOT OF MY CREW.
LIKE MY NEW CAMERAMAN JULIAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HI, JULIAN.
EXCUSE ME.
JULIAN, YOU ARE STILL ON THE CLOCK.
WHO SAID YOU COULD STOP DANCING?
[DISCO MUSIC PLAYING]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN STOP.
YOU CAN STOP.
YOU CAN STOP.
I'M GETTING SEASICK.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, AN ORDINARY ANTI-GAY CRUSADING POOCH WOULD STICK ITS TAIL BETWEEN ITS LEGS, BUT THIS
FALL DOG MOUNTED A STIFF DEFENSE.
ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE, REKERS JUSTIFIED HIS TRIP BY BARKING,
"LIKE JESUS CHRIST, I DELIBERATELY SPEND TIME WITH SINNERS WITH THE LOVING GOAL OF
TRYING TO HELP THEM." YES.
JESUS SPENT TIME WITH PROSTITUTES.
THAT'S WHY GOOD CHRISTIANS SHOULD ALWAYS ASK THEMSELVES,
WBWJR -- WHAT BOY WOULD JESUS RENT?
SO, MR. REKERS, FOR PUBLICLY CONDEMNING MAN LOVE WHILE PRIVATELY BEING MAN'S BEST
FRIEND, YOU, SIR, ARE||||
