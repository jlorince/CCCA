>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT
CREATED "MAD MEN." WE'LL HE'SABOUT TO MEET ANGRY MAN.
PLEASE WELCOME MATTHEW WEINER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HEY!
GREAT TO SEE YOU!
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.
.>> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?
.>> Stephen: I'M FINE, I'M ALITTLE EXCITED THAT YOU'RE HERE.
I'M A LITTLE SAD ABOUT WHATWE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT
BECAUSE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THEEND OF "MAD MEN" HERE.
THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEVENTHAND FINAL SEASON ENDS MAY 25,
AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE FINALSEASON IS NEXT YEAR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT'SOCCASIONALLY KNOWN IN TV AS
"NEXT SEASON."
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SO WAS ITYOUR IDEA OR THE NETWORK'S TO
SPLIT THE SEASON IN HALF AND --MILK IT?
(LAUGHTER)DOES DON WORK ON A DAIRY FARM
IN THE FINAL EPISODE? WHY BREAKIT IN HALF?
>> THEY DID THIS WITH "BREAKINGBAD."
THEY SPLIT THE LAST TWO SEASONSFOR AN ORGANIC REASON WHICH IS
THAT VINCE COULDN'T MAKE THESCHEDULE, SO THEY HAD EIGHT ONE
YEAR AND EIGHT THE NEXT YEAR ANDTHE SHOW BUILT IN A HUGE WAY.
>> Stephen: IT'S BEEN ON FORSEVEN SEASONS.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN DESCRIBEWHAT HAS HAPPENED, OKAY?
LET ME SUMMARIZE IT.
DON SMOKED, BANGED EVERYTHING ONTHE EASTERN SEABOARD, AND
CALIFORNIA, SOLD SOME SOAP, WASGRIM ABOUT IT.
AND SMOKED SOME MORE.
IS HE A CRITICISM OF THEAMERICAN MALE?
BECAUSE I'M AN AMERICAN MALE ANDSHOULD BY TAKING THIS
PERSONALLY?
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S MEANT AS ANEGATIVE THING.
I ALWAYS SORT OF THOUGHT THAT HEWAS ABOUT THE SORT OF SPLIT
MESSAGE THAT THE AMERICAN MALEGETS, THAT YOU ARE TOLD THAT
YOU -- TO BE ATTRACTIVE -- ONTHE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE TO BE,
LIKE, YOU KNOW, LITTLE LEAGUECOACH AND, LIKE, P.T.A. GUY,
GREAT HUSBAND, GREAT DAD.
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ARESUPPOSED TO SMOKE AS MUCH,
DRINK AS MUCH AND GET LAIDAS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: AND GET THE OTHERGUY.
>> AND BE CARNIVOROUS INBUSINESS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
THOSE TWO THINGS, I'M ALWAYSSURPRISED HOW MUCH PEOPLE GET
OFF ON HIM WINNING, BUT I DON'TJUDGE HIM AT ALL.
NONE OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AJUDGEMENT OF THE AUDIENCE.
>> Stephen: I WAS AFRAID HEWAS JUDGING ME.
WHEN THE SHOW STARTED, HE WAS ASHINY OBJECT, FUN, SEXY, BUT AS
IT GOES ON, HE BECOMES AN EVENMORE COMPLEX CHARACTER.
WHY PRESENT SOMETHING COMPLEX?
WHY CAN'T I JUST BE KIND OF FUNAND SEXY, YOU KNOW, GOOD LOOKING
GUY AND THEN TAKE ALL THAT INNERLIFE AND JUST KEEP IT DOWN UNTIL
ONE DAY IT JUST KILLS ME ANDTHEN, YOU KNOW, MY LOVED ONES
READ MY LETTERS AND CRY FOREVER?
(LAUGHTER)THAT IS A SERIES.
>> WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS AGOOD SERIES.
>> Stephen: THIS IS 1969.
YEAH.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ENDING THESHOW BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID TO
SHOW '70s FASHIONS?
(LAUGHTER)ARE YOU TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO
SHOW FRINGE AND LEISURE SUITS?
>> IT GETS PRETTY BAD PRETTYSOON, I HAVE TO SAY,
HAVING GROWN UP IN THAT PERIOD,MY DAD HAD A GIANT RED MUSTACHE
HE USED TO WEAR BOWLING SHOESAND A MAROON BLAZER.
THAT'S MY DAD. MY MOM'S STUFFWAS MORE INSANE.
>> Stephen: WHAT COLOR WAS YOURMOTHER'S BEARD?
>> MY MOTHER HAD A LIGHTLYBLEACHED MUSTACHE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THAT'SA VERY SWEET MEMORY FOR A
SON TO HAVE.
BUT OUR VISION OF THE 1960S,IT'S KIND OF A BEAUTIFIC VIEW.
WE EVEN HAVE SAINTED FIGURESTHROUGHOUT THE 1960s
WITH BOTH KENNEDYSAND KING.
BUT THIS VISION WE'RE GETTING OFINDIVIDUALS' LIVES IS NOT
NECESSARILY A HAPPY ONE.
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY HAPPYMEMORIES OF THE 1960s?
I WAS BORN IN 1964 AND 1969 WASSO HAPPY TO ME.
I WAS ALWAYS WITH MY MOM ANDLISTENING TO "THE ASSOCIATION"
ON THE RADIO.
(LAUGHTER)>> I WAS BORN IN '65 AND I
REMEMBER LISTENING TO SPANKY ANDOUR GANG AND MY DAD LISTENED TO
JUDY COLLINS.
NO, BUT I HAD A HAPPY MEMORY.
THERE IS A POSITIVE ELEMENT TOIT WHICH IS LIKE YOU RECOGNIZE
PARTS OF YOUR LIFE.
BUT I REALLY WANTED TO TELL THESTORY THAT OUR VIEW OF THE
'60s HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN BY ACERTAIN GENERATION THAT WAS EVEN
A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN YOU ANDI ARE.
AND THEY HAVE A VERY ROSYPICTURE --
>> Stephen: THE BABY BOOMERS.
YES.
>> Stephen: THEY WON'T LET USSTOP THINKING ABOUT THE 60s.
>> THEY THINK THEY INVENTED SEX,DRUGS, YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: YEP.
THEY HAVE A VIEW OF ITTHAT IS A CHILD'S VIEW OF IT.
SO I WANTED TO SAY WHAT WOULD ITBE IF YOU WERE AN ADULT WHO
LIVE THROUGH FAIRLY INTERESTINGTHINGS LIKE WORLD WAR II AND THE
GREAT DEPRESSION AND THEN THISCOMES ALONG.
AND THERE WAS TREMENDOUS CHANGEAND THE CLICHE TURBULENCE AND
FREE LOVE.
BUT THERE WAS FREE LOVE IN THE1920s AND THE 1930s, THE
BEATNICK MOVEMENT OF THE 1950s.NO ONE INVENTED ANY OF THIS.
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS THEREWAS A GENERATION THAT WAS ASKED
BUT THEY GOT EDUCATION, A LOT OFENTERTAINMENT, THEY GOT SPENDING
MONEY, THEY BECAME THE FOCUS OFTHE ECONOMY, OF
EVERYTHING, THERE WAS AWAR GOING ON WHICH THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO FIGHT AND SOMEDIDN'T, BUT IN THE GENERATION
BEFORE THEM ALL OF THEM FOUGHT,AND THEY HAVE A VERY SORT OF
DEMANDING -- I EXPERIENCE IT INREAL LIFE.
THEY'LL COME UP AND SAY WHATHAPPENED TO THIS OR THAT?
AND I'M, LIKE, I'M NOT TELLINGYOUR STORY.
I'M TELLING THE STORY OF YOURPARENTS OR YOUR GRANDPARENTS.
SO I DON'T HAVE A JUDGMENT ONIT, NECESSARILY -- THAT SOUNDED
REALLY JUDGMENTAL, IT DID --(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW.>> Stephen: LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
MATTHEW.
>> YEAH, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FORAN ENDING FOR THE SERIES, YOU
WORKED ON "THE SOPRANOS," OKAY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: A GREAT ENDING TOTHIS SERIES "MAD MEN" WOULD BE
IF, IN THE LAST EPISODE, DONTURNED TO THE CAMERA AND
EXPLAINED THE ENDING OF "THESOPRANOS."
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, IT'S APLEASURE!
>> Stephen:  MATT WEINER, "MADMEN" FINAL EPISODE, MAY 25TH
FOR THIS  SEASON. WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK!
