>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "A NATION OF WUSSES."
WHY WOULD HE WRITE A BOOK ABOUT CANADA?
PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR ED RENDELL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
I HAVEN'T SAT DOWN WITH YOU FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS.
THANK SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  NOW YOU'RE AN OLD-TIME DEM POL.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU HAVE THAT OLD TRIP O'NEILL GRAVITAS ABOUT YOU.
DO YOU THINK THE OLD DEMS DOWN THERE HAVE THAT OLD MAGIC?
>> I THINK THE CONVENTION INSPIRED PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE AND MOST OF OUR BASE WATCHING IT AND THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
TRIED TO DO.
I KNOW HE DIDN'T GET CREDIT FOR MAKING A BIG, SOARING SPEECH --
>> Stephen:  NO, IT WAS A NOTHING BURGER.
I HEARD ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAID HE WASN'T SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT DO.
ALL HE SAID WAS EVERYTHING I'VE DONE I'M PRETTY PROUD OF.
GUESS WHAT I'LL DO NEXT?
( LAUGHTER )
>> LOOK, LOOK, IT WAS SHORT ON DETAILS, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE DID WAS I THINK REMIND
US WHY WE'RE DEMOCRATS AND --
>> Stephen:  WHY ARE YOU DEMOCRATS?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> BECAUSE-- AND I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE-- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE SHOULD DO AS A COUNTRY
IS TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER, THAT GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE A ROLE IT PLAY, AND THAT ROLE IS GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T
HAVE IT AND TAKING CARE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS.
THAT'S WHAT THE COUNTRY IS ABOUT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  DON'T-- DON'T DO THIS.
THEY'RE JUST BEING POLITE TO YOU, SIR.
THEY'RE MY AUDIENCE.
THEY'RE MY AUDIENCE.
I DEPARTMENT LIKE THE WAY HE THREW AROUND THE WORD "CITIZENSHIP" OKAY.
HE THREW AROUND CITIZENSHIP LIKE THERE WAS SOME RESPONSIBILITY INVOLVED IN CITIZENSHIP.
I FELT LIKE WE ALL GOT JURY DUTY JUST BY WATCHING HIM LAST NIGHT.
CITIZENSHIP MEANS YOU GET A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS YOU WERE BORN HERE, AND YOU GET TO WAVE IT IN THE FACE OF THE
PEOPLE AS THEY GET BOOTED BACK OVER THE BORDER.
THAT'S CITIZENSHIP.
THAT'S HOW THAT WORD SHOULD BE USED.
>> CITIZENSHIP-- CITIZENSHIP AS THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT IT AND WE BELIEVE, CITIZENSHIP MEANS YOU TAKE CARE
OF OTHER AMERICANS.
CITIZENSHIP MEANS YOU SACRIFICE FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
NOBODY SACRIFICES ANYMORE.
>> Stephen:  BUT HE'S FLIPPING THE SCRIPT ON THE REPUBLICANS HERE.
THIS IS WHAT HE'S DOING.
FOR FOUR YEARS THEY'VE BEEN SAYING, "I DON'T THINK HE'S REALLY A CITIZEN."  AND HE'S SAYING, "ANOTHER NOT ONLY AM I A
CITIZEN," HE'S SAYING, "THIS IS WHAT CITIZENSHIP MEANS." DO YOU DO THAT?
NO?
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THE CITIZENS.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
NOW, OKAY--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING I DO LIKE.
I LIKE TOUGH TALK, OKAY.
YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED "A NATION OF WUSSES." "HOW AMERICA'S LEADERS LOST THE GUTS TO MAKE US GREAT."
OKAY, YOU'RE SHOOTING RIGHT FROM THE HIP ON THIS ONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "NATION OF WUSSES, SIR?"
>> OR LEADERS ARE MORE WUSSES THAN OUR PEOPLE AND ONE OF THE REASONS THEY'RE WUSSES IS THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE PEOPLE.
THEY WON'T TELL THE PEOPLE THE TRUTH.
I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE ABOUT OUR GUYS.
MEDICARE WAS PASSED IN 1965.
THE LIFE EXPECTANCY, AVERAGE WAS 69 YEARS OF AGE.
TODAY THE LIFE EXPECTANCY IS 85 YEARS OF AGE.
THE PROGRAM WAS NEVER MEANT TO COVER 20 YEARS OF LIFE.
SOC OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAVE TO BE CHANGES.
>> Stephen:  WE HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE DIE EARLIER.
I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR YEARS!
>> A VERY ADEPT SOLUTION.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, I SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS.
>> BUT WE'RE AFRAID TO TELL OUR BASE.
AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THIS LITTLE GUY WHO NOBODY VOTED FOR AND WHO IS REALLY THE MODERN DAY WIZARD OF
OZ, GROVER NORQUIST.
>> Stephen:  GROVER'S A FRIEND.
GROVER A A FRIEND NOW, OKAY.
>> WELL, THE FROM THE PRT IS MY FRIEND AND YOU TRASHED HIM.
>>HIM.
>> Stephen:  I WILL-- I WILL-- I WILL TELL YOU, THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
GROVER NORQUIST HAS A PLEDGE.
AND EVIDENTLY, THAT'S SCARIER TO THE REPUBLICANS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE THEY WON'T BREAK THE PLEDGE.
AND THEY'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TELL GROVER AND EVERYONE ELSE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS HOLE WITHOUT RAISING SOME REVENUE.
AND THAT'S A FACT.
AND GROVER CAN'T SAY IT.
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS REAL ACTION AND THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO STAND UP AND TAKE THE HIT.
AND MY FAVORITE CHAPTER IN THE BOOK-- AND I WROTE EVERY WORD OF THIS BOOK MYSELF--  ( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
>> AND I TITLED ALL MY CHAPTERS IS "STAND AND DEFEND.
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WORTH LOSING FOR." IF YOU RUN FOR OFFICE AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING
IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RISK YOUR JOB FOR, THEN DON'T RUN IN THE FIRST PLACE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA-- THAT IS EXCELLENT ADVICE.
THAT IS EXCELLENT ADVICE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD LOSE THIS ELECTION OVER?
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, IF HE LOSES, IF HE LOSES, MAYBE HE'LL LOSE ON OBAMACARE, BUT IF HE LOSES HE'LL GO OUT THE DOOR KNOWING HE GAVE
31 MILLION AMERICANS WHO NEVER HAD IT BEFORE HEALTH CARE.
THAT'S WHAT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOVERNOR ED RENDELL.
"A NATION OF WUSSES." DON'T BE ONE.
