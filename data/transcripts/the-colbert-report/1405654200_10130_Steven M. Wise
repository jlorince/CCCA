AND THESE ARE THE SAMETHINGS THAT MAKE US SO IMPORTANT
THAT MAKE US WANT TO FILEWRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS WHEN

>> Stephen: YOU'RE ON YOURWEB SITE HERE 2003 YOU SAID
OUR GOAL IS TO BREACH THELEGAL WALL THAT SEPARATES
ALL HUMANS FROM ALL NONHUMANANIMALS.
THIS CASE IS JUST THEBEGINNING.
THIS IS THE CAMEL'S NOSE UNDERTHE TENT FLAP AND THEN THE CAMEL
GETS HABAEUS CORPUS TOO.

WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANTTO HIM.
AND THE FOLKS THAT AREKEEPING HIM ARE KEEPING HIM
IN THE WAY YOU JUST SAW.
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO KEEPTHEM IN THOSE KINDS OF
CONDITIONS.
WE WANT TO GET THEM OUT.
>> Stephen: AND WHAT YOURDESIRE FOR TOMMY DOES TO OUR
LEGAL SYSTEM AND THESTANDING OF MANKIND, AND OUR
PRIMACY IN OUR VISION OF THEUNIVERSE IS JUST, JUST
WRECKAGE ON THE WAY TO YOURMAD GOAL TO RELEASE ONE
CHIMP.
>> A SIMPLE YES OR NO.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> WHAT IS DOES IS IT SHOWSTHAT WE CAN EXTEND JUSTICE
TO WHEREVER THERE SHOULD BEJUSTICE, WHETHER WE ARE
DEALING WITH A HUMAN OR ANYOTHER BEING.
