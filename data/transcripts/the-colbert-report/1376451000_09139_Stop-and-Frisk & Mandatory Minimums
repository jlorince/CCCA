(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, YOU'RE VERY KIND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, NATION, I DON'T WANT TO
ALARM ANYONE BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE
MY STUDIO TONIGHT, YOU MAY VERY
WELL BE HUNTED FOR SPORT.
BECAUSE YESTERDAY NEW YORK CITY
BECAME A KILL ZONE.
>> A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED NEW
YORK CITY'S CONTROVERSIAL STOP
AND FRISK PROGRAM VIOLATES THE
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF
MINORITIES BY "CONDUCTING STOPS
IN A RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY
MANNER."
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
FOLKS.
UNELECTED ACTIVIST JUDGE HAS
REJECTED STOP AND FRISK ON THE
BIZARRE THEORY THAT MINORITIES
HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOT
TO BE STOPPED AT RANDOM AND MAN
HANDLE BID STRANGERS.
(LAUGHTER)
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WHEN THE
CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN
MINORITIES WEREN'T EVEN INVENTED
YET.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK.
THANKFULLY MAYOR BLOOMBERG SAYS
HE WILL FIGHT TO PRESERVE STOP
AND FRISK BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU
CAN'T MAKE A SAFETY OMELET
WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW BROWN
EGGS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
JIM?
>> WE GO TO WHERE THE REPORTS OF
CRIME ARE.
THOSE UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN TO BE
POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND MY  *R
MINORITY NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THE PROGRAM
IS NOT ABOUT COLOR, IT'S ABOUT
FRISKABILITY.
(LAUGHTER)
IN FACT, I DON'T SEE COLOR, NOT
EVEN MY OWN.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I
BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I DON'T GET
FRISKED.
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS FOR YEARS, FOR
YEARS THIS HAS BEEN A SAFE CITY,
A WONDERFUL TOY FOR A GIRL AND A
BOY.
BUT NOW IT WILL BE TEEMING WITH
UNFRISKED BLACK AND/OR HISPANIC
PEOPLE.
I WON'T PWEFPB ABLE TO CROSS THE
STREET TO AVOID A SUSPICIOUS
LOOKING AFRICAN AMERICAN WITHOUT
RUNNING INTO A QUESTIONABLE
LATINO ON THE OTHER SIDE!
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO WALK DOWN
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET "HERE
COMES THE CAB" I'M DEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST WHO'S
ON THE STREETS NOW, IT'S ALSO
ABOUT THE THUGS HEADED BACK
THERE.
BECAUSE YESTERDAY ATTORNEY
GENERAL ERIC HOLDER ANNOUNCED
NEW FEDERAL GUIDELINES TO
UNDERMINE OUR WAR ON DRUGS.
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER
ANNOUNCED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
WILL STOP SEEKING MANDATORY
MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR OFFENDERS
ACCUSED OF LOW-LEVEL NONVIOLENCE
DRUG CRIMES LIKE A SMALL-TIME
DRUG CURRIER.
INSTEAD, THEY'LL ASK TO SEND
THEM TO DRUG TREATMENT AND
COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS.
>> Stephen: NO JAIL TIME, JUST
REHAB.
IT'S LIKE EVERY MINOR DRUG
OFFENDER SUDDENLY BECAME A WHITE
