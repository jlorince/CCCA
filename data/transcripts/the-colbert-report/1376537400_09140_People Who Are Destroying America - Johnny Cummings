GREEK ROOTS.
AND FOLKS RUSSIA'S NOT THE ONLY
PLACE TRYING TO DEFEND ITS
FAMILY VALUES BECAUSE
UNFORTUNATELY AMERICA'S
TRADITIONAL SMALL TOWN MORALS
ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM WITHIN.
WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING THE
GAY AGENDA, WE'VE ALREADY LOST
OUR BIG CITIES.
THANKFULLY, AMERICA'S FAMILY
VALUES ARE KEPT ALIVE IN SMALL
TOWNS LIKE IN KENTUCKY IN THE
HEART OF APPALACHIA I CAN'T.
>> ABOUT 335-340 PEOPLE.
WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER.
>> EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER.
WE'RE PRO GUN, HARD WORKING.
COUNTRY PEOPLE.
IT'S A FINE TOWN.
Stephen: A FINE TOWN.
BUT FOR HOW LONG?
MEET THE MAYOR JOHNNY CUMMINGS.
GO BACK.
TOO FAR.
GO BACK.
A LITTLE MORE.
GOOD.
>> HEY, I'M JOHNNY CUMMINGS.
I'M THE MAYOR HERE.
[BLEEP]
>> Stephen: AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING.
>> KENTUCKY.
Stephen: NO, THE OTHER THING.
I AM A GAY MAN.
Stephen: A GAY MAN AND A GAY
MARE DESTROYING AMERICA.
... A GAY MAYOR DESTROYING
AMERICA.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: AMERICANS COUNT ON
SMAWN TOWNS TO UPHOLD
TRADITIONAL MORALITY.
BUT MAYOR CUMMINGS IS USING HIS
OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT THE GAY
AGENDA.
>> HE'S THE BEST ONE MAYOR WE'VE
HAD HERE IS HIM.
>> AS MAYOR OF THE CITY, HE'S
DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB.
>> HE'S CHANGED EVERYTHING.
MADE THINGS BETTER.
>> Stephen: BETTER IF YOU MEAN
GAYER.
>> THE WORKERS WENT OUT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND PATCHED
THE POTHOLES.
>> Stephen: GAY.
PUT A NEW BRIDGE TO THE SEWER
PLANT.
>> Stephen: GAY.
A FAMILY CENTER, A PARK, A
PLAYGROUND, STUFF FOR THE KIDS.
>> Stephen: GAY, GAY.
HE HAS ADDRESSED THE WATER
SITUATION.
IT'S BETTER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.
>> Stephen: BUT BETTER ISN'T GAY
ENOUGH FOR MAYOR CUMMINGS.
LISTEN TO WHAT HE GAY-ED UP
NEXT.
>> I INTRODUCED THE FIREMAN'S
ORDINANCE.
>> Stephen: AND WHAT DOES HE
CONSIDER FAIR?
>> ONE COULD BE DENIED SERVICE
AND TERMINATED FROM THEIR JOB
ORE VINGTED FROM THEIR HOUSE
JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL
PREFERENCE.
>> Stephen: NO ONE, NOT EVEN A
GAY GUY.
BUT ONE BRAVE KENTUCKIAN KNOWS
WHAT FAIRNESS REALLY MEANS.
>> FAIRNESS IS NOTHING BUT A
TRICK WORD.
>> Stephen: LOCAL PASTOR TRUMAN
HURT IS BRINGING THE HURT TO THE
FAIRNESS ORDINANCE.
>> WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRE AND
DENY THEM SERVICE OR DENY THEM
HOUSING.
>> Stephen: BUT PASTOR HURT HAS
NOTHING AGAINST GAYS.
>> I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST GAYS.
I DON'T LIKE THEIR LIFESTYLE.
I DON'T LIKE THEM TRYING TO PUSH
IT ON ME AND MY FAMILY.
AND THE COMMUNITY.
>> Stephen: SO?
THEY OUGHT TO GO BACK IN THE
CLOSET WHERE THEY BELONG.
>> Stephen: AND PASTOR HURT HAS
THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE CITY'S
SIMPLE HILL FOLK.
>> I'M IN FAVOR OF THE GAY
RIGHTS ORDINANCE.
>> Stephen: HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT
FROM THE CITY.
WHO ELSE?
>> I THINK THE ORDINANCE IS A
GREAT THING.
>> Stephen: SHE'S A LESBIAN.
WHAT ABOUT GARY?
GARY, TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE ORDINANCE.
>> I HAVE ONE THING AGAINST IT.
NOT ONE THING.
>> Stephen: NOT ONE THING.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
>> THIS IS A SMALL TOWN.
THEY THINK WE'RE A BUNCH OF
CLOSE MINDED HILL BILLIES.
>> Stephen: YES, WE COUNT ON
THAT AND THIS OPENLY GAY MAYOR
IS RUINING ALL OUR CLASSIC
STEREOTYPES.
>> I'M ALSO THE TOWN
HAIRDRESSER.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THAT ONE STICKS.
BUT HOW HAS MAYOR CUMMINGS SO
QUICKLY DESTROYED THE VALUES OF
THE SALT OF THE ERLT IN-BRED
YOLKALS IN THE ANSWER WILL SHOCK
YOU.
>> THERE IS A GAY MAFIA THAT HAS
INFLICTED THE FEAR OF DEATH.
THEY HAVE THOSE WHO ARE, YOU
KNOW, THAT CLAIM TO BE FIGHTING
AGAINST BOEING BECOMING THE
BULLIES.
>> HOW CAN I BULLY, YOU KNOW,
HETEROSEXUAL COAL MINER INTO
DOING ANYTHING?
>> Stephen: HOW?
GET THE LAW ON YOUR SIDE.
>> I KNOW HE'S GAY.
YEAH, HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF
BEING LOVERS.
A LOT OF THINGS THROUGHOUT THE
YEARS, HE'S BEEN THROUGH ALL
FOUR OF MY MARRIAGES.
THAT BOY KNOWS MORE ABOUT ME
THAN MOST PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.
I LOVE HIM LIKE A BROTHER.
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM JUST
LIKE THAT.
JUST LIKE A BROTHER.
>> Stephen: THE FATE NOW LAY IN
THE HANDS OF ITS FRIGHTENING
COMMISSIONER CLAUDE BRANSON,
JIMMY SLOAN, AND JOEL COTTON
COONS.
HAS CUMMINGS GOTTEN TO THEM?
>> THE ORDINANCE PASSED EASILY 3
TO 1 WHICH MADE US THE SMALLEST
TOWN IN THE NATION TO PASS AN
ORDINANCE LIKE THIS.
>> Stephen: MAYOR GAYER WON AND
SMALL TOWN AMERICA LOST.
>> HETEROSEXUAL MEN DISCUSSED
AND DEBATED AND PASSED THIS
ORDINANCE, IT MADE ME VERY PROUD
TO BE A GAY MAN IN EASTERN
KENTUCKY.
>> Stephen: EXPLAIN YOURSELF ONE
OF THOSE FOUR HETEROSEXUAL MAN.
>> I DID VOTE FOR THE ORDINANCE.
I DIDN'T SEE NO BIG DEAL IN IT.
>> Stephen: OH, NO.
TELL HIM, PASTOR.
>> I'VE SEEN IT.
IN SOME OF THE CITIES HOW THEY
COME IN AND JUST TAKE OVER ONE
PLACE AND THEN THEY SAY THAT'S A
GAY BAR NOW.
>> Stephen: YES.
THIS IS A GAY BAR NOW.
WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GAY BARS?
>> I'VE BEEN TO A GAY BAR IN
DALLAS TEXAS.
>> Stephen: WAIT, WHAT?
AND I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH
WHAT GOES ON IN A GAY BAR.
>> Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN A GAY BAR?
>> I WAS TT GAY BAR TO GET A
BEER.
I JUST WALKED INTO THE PLACE.
I WAS JUST MAKING...
>> Stephen: FRIENDS?
MY ROUNDS.
IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE A CASE
THAT SAID BEER.
>> Stephen: GAY BAR?
THAT'S WHY I STOPPED.
Stephen: TODAY IT'S THIS TOWN
BUT WHAT IF GAY TOLERANCE
SPREADS TO THE REST OF SMALL
TOWN AMERICA?
>> IF GAY TOLERANCE SPREADS,
YES, IT WOULD HURT EVERYTHING IN
A BAD WAY.
>> I HAD FIVE OTHERS WHO CAME UP
AND THEY ALL SAID WE WANT TO BE
THE NEXT ONE.
THAT WAS GREAT.
>> Stephen: GREAT IF YOU LIKE
SWIMMING IN A LAKE OF FIRE.
>> HOMOSEXUALS ARE SINNERS.
WITHOUT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
THEY'RE GOING TO HELL.
>> Stephen: SO JOHNNY CUMMINGS,
HAVE FUN AS MAYOR OF HELL.
THAT'S SOMETHING THESE BACK
WOODS BIBLE THUMPERS CAN
UNDERSTAND.
>> GOD MAKES THEM BORN GAY, WHY
IS HE AGAINST IT?
IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE.
IF HE IS AGAINST IT, WHY DID HE
MAKE THEM BORN THAT WAY?
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
I'VE TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
I CAN'T.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
