(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
BEING HERE ON-- NICE TO BEHERE ON SUCH A SPECIAL
NIGHT.
I JUST HAD A NEW CHILD.
AND IT'S THE EASIEST BIRTHI'VE EVER HAD.
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY, AVERY.
NATION, WE ARE JUST-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, WE AREJUST 100 DAYS AWAY FROM
BEING 845 DAYS AWAY FROM THE2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
AND THE GOP FIELD IS ALREADYFULL OF STRONG CONTENDERS
FORMING COMMITTEES TOEXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF
TALKING TO THEIR FAMILIESABOUT MAYBE VACATIONING IN
IOWA THIS YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)THE CANDIDATE I'VE BEEN
PINNING MY HOPES ON IS JEBBUSH, HE'S A STRONG LEADER
WHOSE VICTORY WOULD RETURNDIGNITY TO THE WHITE HOUSE
AND RELEVANCE TO MY TRAMP STAMP.
SADLYTHIS PAST WEEKEND JEB SHOT
HIMSELF IN THE FOOT WHICHWOULD HAVE BEEN A RINGING
ENDORSEMENT OF GUN RIGHTS IFHE HADN'T ALSO SAID THIS
ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
>> THEY CROSS THE BORDERBECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER
MEANS TO WORK, TO BE ABLE TOPROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY.
YES, THEY BROKE THE LAW, BUTIT'S NOT A FELONY.
IT'S KIND OF-- IT'S AN ACTOF LOVE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: HE WILL BE
MISSED.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY
VOTERS KNOW THAT ILLEGALIMMIGRATION IS NOT AN ACT OF
LOVE, SIR.
IT IS ILLICIT FILTHY ACT OFBORDER PENETRATION.
NO LOVE INVOLVED.
IT IS SWEATY AND IT ISFRANTIC.
AND ODDS ARE IT IS HAPPENINGIN THE BACK OF A TRUCK.
(LAUGHTER)THE ONLY LOVE GOING ON HERE
IS THE IMMIGRANT'S LOVE FORAMERICAN JOBS EDUCATION AND
HEALTH CARE.
I SAY IF IMMIGRANTS LOVEDTHEIR FAMILIES SO MUCH THEN
WHY DOES MY HOUSEKEEPERNEVER SEEM TO GO HOME TO HER
KIDS.
SHE'S ALWAYS WITH MINE.
BY THE WAY, ROSITA, I NEEDYOU TO STAY LATE TONIGHT.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, FOLKS,IMMIGRATION IS WHAT MADE
THIS COUNTRY GREAT.
BUT ONLY WHEN IT'S THE RESULTOF NAZIS, POTATO FAMINE OR
HOWEVER BLACK PEOPLE GOTHERE.
I DON'T KNOW.NICE TRY, JEB, IT'S OVER.
