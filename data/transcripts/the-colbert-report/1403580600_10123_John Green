WEEKS ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES"BESTSELLER LIST AND A MOVIE
RELEASED ON JUNE 6th THATIS KICKING ALL KINDS OF ASS.
IT REALLY IS.
NOW, I... WHEN I FIRST HEARD"FAULT IN OUR STARS," I ASSUMED
IT WAS ABOUT ALIENS WHO COMEDOWN TO EARTH WITH SOME SORT OF
RAY GUN THAT MAKES TEENAGERSCRY.
>> YEAH.
THAT'S PART OF IT.

TWO TEENAGERS WITH CANCER WHOFALL IN LOVE.
>> YEAH, IT'S THE STORY OF TWOKIDS WHO MEET AT SUPPORT GROUP.

THEY ALSO FALL IN LOVE WITH ABOOK AND THEY WANT TO MEET THE
AUTHOR OF THAT BOOK.
IT'S STORY OF THEIR COMINGTOGETHER AND BEING IN LOVE EVEN
THOUGH THEY'RE BOTH QUITE SICK.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU COMEUP WITH THE IDEA?
DID YOU JUST TAKE THE SADDESTTHINGS YOU CAN THINK OF AND THEN
JUST PUT THEM ON PIECES OF PAPERAND PUT IT IN THE MOST
DEPRESSING HAT IMAGINABLE?
PULL THEM OUT AND DO IT LIKEMAGNETIC POETRY?
WHY MAKE US CRY SO HARD?

I WOULD GO INTO STARBUCKS ATLIKE 7:30 AND OPEN UP MY
COMPUTER AND BEGIN TO WEEP.
THEN FOUR HOURS LATER I WOULDCLOSE MY COMPUTER AND GO INTO MY
OFFICE.
AND I'M SURE THE BARISTASTHOUGHT I WAS BANANAS.
I CRIED A LOT WRITING IT.
I WAS REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WITH AYOUNG WOMAN NAMED ESTHER, TO
WHOM THE BOOK IS DEDICATED.
ESTHER DIED OF CANCER IN AUGUST2010 WHEN SHE WAS 16.
A LOT OF THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN INA FURIOUS PERIOD OF GRIEF AFTER
HER DEATH.
SO IT WAS JUST SOMETHING ICOULDN'T NOT WRITE.
IT IS USUALLY THE MOST FUN KINDOF WRITING, BUT IN THIS CASE IT
WAS ALSO THE MOST SAD.
>> Stephen: WELL, THIS HASBEEN CALLED A "YOUNG ADULT
NOVEL."
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT TERM,"YOUNG ADULT NOVEL" BECAUSE AS
FAR AS I CAN TELL, A YOUNG ADULTNOVEL IS A REGULAR NOVEL THAT
PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ.
[LAUGHTER]>> YEAH.

NOVEL, THERE'S A GHETTOIZATIONOF IT

NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.
OVER 200 MILLION VIEWS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ON THEVLOG BROTHERS THAT YOU CAN'T DO
IN A BOOK?
>> WELL, BOOKS TAKE YEARS ANDYEARS TO WRITE.
IT'S LIKE A REALLY LONG GAME OFMARCO POLO WHERE YOU'RE IN YOUR
BASEMENT SAYING MARCO, MARCO,MARCO, MARCO, AND IT'S NOT FOR
LIKE FOUR YEARS THAT SOMEONESAYS OH, POLO.
