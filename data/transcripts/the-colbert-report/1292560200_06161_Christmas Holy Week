>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
WELCOME.
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" )
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GOT TO
SAY, THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
CHRISTMAS CAROL I'VE EVER HEARD.
( LAUGHTER )
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, CHRISTMAS IS SO CLOSE I
CAN TASTE IT, BY WHICH I MEAN I
HAVE ALREADY STARTED HITTING THE
NOG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BOOM.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE HATE THIS
HOLIDAY, LIKE SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER HARRY REID, A.K.A. THE
ALBINO RAISIN WHO STOLE
CHRISTMAS.
( LAUGHTER )
JIMMY.
>> DEMOCRATIC SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER HARRY REID IS THREATENING
TO MAKE LAWMAKERS WORK BETWEEN
CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S.
>> THERE'S STILL CONGRESS AFTER
CHRISTMAS, SO IF THE REPUBLICANS
THINK THAT THEY CAN STALL AND
STALL AND STALL THAT WE'LL TAKE
A BREAK AND WE'RE THROUGH, WE'RE
NOT THROUGH.
>> Stephen: WELL, REPUBLICAN
JON KYL FIRED BACK A
HEAT-SEEKING MISTLETOE.
>> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ALL OF
THE THINGS THAT THE MAJORITY
LEADER LAID OUT WITHOUT
DISRESPECTING ONE OF THE TWO
HOLIEST OF HOLIDAYS FOR
CHRISTIANS.
>> Stephen: YES, IT IS SO EASY
TO FORGET THAT THE WEEK AFTER
CHRISTMAS IS ONE OF THE TWO
HOLIEST OF HOLIDAYS.
THE OTHER, OF COURSE, BEING
SHARK WEEK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO WHAT.
I SAY, I SAY SO WHAT IF REID'S
NOT ASKING REPUBLICANS TO WORK
ON CHRISTMAS DAY.
THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF
THIS HOLY WEEK.
HE'S DESECRATING DECEMBER
26th, WHEN GOOD CHRISTIANS
HEAD BACK TO THE MALL FOR THE
HOLY DAY OF RETURNANCE.
( LAUGHTER )
WHICH COMMEMORATES JESUS'
RETURNING OF THE FRANKINCENSE.
NOT THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.
HE JUST GOT A LOT OF IT THAT
YEAR.
AND THE NEXT DAY IS JUST AS
SACRED, THE HOLY ELLIPTICALS OF
MARY WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE GYM
MEMBERSHIP IN HONOR OF THE
VIRGIN MOTHER AND HER STRUGGLE
TO LOSE THE BLESSED BABY WEIGHT.
THEN THE FEAST OF THE OBLIGATION
OF THE NEPHEWS WHEN YOU ARE
FORCED TO TAKE YOUR SISTER'S
KIDS TO SEE "YOGI BEAR 3D,"
TRULY A VISION OF HELL.
AND THE HOLY WEEK CULMINATION,
OF COURSE, WITH THE ROCKING YVE
OF ST. SEACREST.
SO DEMOCRATS, HANDS OFF OUR WEEK
AFTER CHRISTMAS, OR WHEN THE
REPUBLICANS ARE IN CHARGE
THEY'LL MAKE YOU WORK THROUGH
YOUR HOLIEST DAY,
