>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
ON RELIGION AND HUMOR.
I LOVED THE OPEN MIC ON THE
MOUNT.
PLEASE WELCOME FATHER JIM
MARTIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, HOW IS IT GOING, JIM?
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU GET THAT
KIND AFTER APPLAUSE WHEN YOU SAY
MASS?
>> EVERY SUNDAY.
YES, RIGHT UP HERE.
YOU ARE HEARING IT.
>> STEPHEN: EXACTLY.
YOU ARE KNOWN TO OUR REGULAR
VIEWERS AS NOT ONLY A JESUIT
PRIEST IN THE CULTURE EDITOR OF
AMERICA MAGAZINE AND AUTHOR OF
JESUITS GUIDE TO ALMOST
EVERYTHING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
YOU ARE THE CHAPLAIN OF COLBERT
NATION.
>> MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY.
>> STEPHEN: A GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY.
>> HEAVY BURDEN.
>> STEPHEN: I HOPE IT DIDN'T
GET IN THE WAY WHY WHEN YOU WERE
WRITING YOUR NEW BOOK "BETWEEN
HEAVEN AND THE MOTION TO
RECONSIDER, WHY JOY, HUMOR AND
LAUGHTER ARE AT THE SPIRIT OF
HUMAN LIFE."
I'M NOT SURE I BUY THAT.
IT NEVER SAID JESUS LAUGHED IT.
SAYS JESUS WEPT.
SHORTEST SENTENCE IN THE NEW
TESTAMENT.
JESUS WEPT.
WAS HE WEEPING WITH LAUGHTER?
>> HE SHOWS A SENSE OF HUMOR IN
PARABLES AND THE STORIES HE
TELLS.
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T GET THE
JOKE BECAUSE WE'RE FAR REMOVED
FROM FIRST CENTURY PALESTINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: SO GOD IS JUST TOO
HIP FOR THE ROOM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THE.
>> BUT THE PEOPLE BACK THEN
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE JOKES WE
MISS THE IRONY.
THE IDEA THAT THAT ONE OF HIS
STORIES THAT A PERSON WOULD HAVE
A PLANK IN THEIR EYE AND
CRITICIZE SOMEONE WHOS HEY SPECK
OF DUST IN THEIRS WOULD HAVE
BEEN SEEN AS HILARIOUS.
IT FALLS FLAT IN 21ST CENTURY
AMERICA.
AND THERE ARE OTHER OCEANS I
TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK ABOUT HIS
SENSE OF HUMOR AND PLAYFULNESS.
HE GIVES THE DISCIPLES NICKNAMES
FOR EXAMPLE.
LIKE PETER.
>> STEPHEN: CALLS HIM THE
ROCK.
THE ROCK BETWEEN THE EARS PETE.
>> SOME HAVE TOLD ME IT'S
PLAYFUL PUN ON HIS CHARACTER,
ROCKY BASICALLY.
HE CALLS TWO OF THE DISCIPLES
JAKE AND JOHN SUN SONS OF AND
THUNDERMENT EXACTLY IT'S A
CRITIQUE ABOUT THEM BEING
LOUDMOUTHS OR THEIR MOTHER
EARLIER ON SAID WILL MY SONS BE
AT YOUR RIGHT HAND.
SOME SCHOLARS SAY IT MAY BE A
PLAYFUL WAY OF TALKING ABOUT
THEY ARE MOTHER.
THERE'S HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.
WE MISS IT.
I'M TRYING TO RECOVER IT IN THE
BOOK.
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S ONE POINT
I THOUGHT HE DID LAUGH WHEN THE
APOSTLES ARE OUT IN THE BOAT ON
THE SEA AND THE BIG STORM COMES
UP AND THEY ARE WORRIED AND THEY
SEE JESUS WALKING TOWARD THEM ON
THE WATER.
AND CALMING THE WATERS AROUND
HIM.
AND PETER SAYS TO HIMSELF, HEY,
IF I'VE GOT FAITH, I SHOULD BE
ABLE TO DO THIS, TOO.
HE STEPS OUT, TAKES A COUPLE OF
STEPS.
HE SEES HIS STORMY, LOSES HIS
FAITH AND FALLS IN.
>> JESUS SAYS COME ON OUT, GO
AHEAD.
I CAN SEE HIM SMILING A LITTLE
BIT.
>> STEPHEN: HE TAKES A COUPLE
OF STEPS.
HE FALLS IN.
AFTER A COUPLE SUCCESSFUL STEPS
IN THE WATER HE FALLS IN LIKE
WYLIE COYOTE LOOKING DOWN AND
GOING OP!
YOU KNOW JESUS MUST HAVE CRACKED
A SMILE WHEN HE SAW HIM FALLING.
>> AT LEAST INWARDLY STEENCHTS
THAT JUST PHYSICAL COMEDY.
WHAT IS FUNNIER THE OLD
TESTAMENT OR NEW TESTAMENT.
THE OLD TESTAMENT HAS HARSH
WORDS FOR JOKE TELLERS.
>> ALSO IT HAS FUNNY STORIES.
ABRAHAM AND SARA WHEN THEY HEAR
SARA IS GOING TO HAVE A BABY IT
SAYS ABRAHAM FELL ON HIS FACE
LAUGHING.
SHE LAUGHS.
GOD SAYS WHY DID YOU LAUGH.
SARA SAID I DIDN'T LAUGH.
GOD SAID YES, YOU DO.
THEY HAVE A BABY AND NAMED HIM
ISAAC WHICH IS HEBREW FOR HE
LAUGHED.
>>
THE RELIGIONS DON'T
GIGGLE MUCH TOGETHER THOUGH.
CAN LAUGHTER -- CAN LAUGHTER OR
MIRTH AS YOU SAY CAN THAT BE IN
PRAYER?
>> YES, BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF
WE'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD
IN PRAYER, ANY RELATIONSHIP CAN
USE HUMOR AND LEVITT.
YOU CAN BE JOYFUL IN PRAYER
ABOUT THINGS YOU ARE GRATEFUL
FOR AND SMILE ABOUT THINGS THAT
MAKE YOU LAUGH AT YOURSELF.
I THINK TO SHARE YOUR JOY AND
LAUGHTER WITH GOD IS VERY
APPROPRIATE LIKE IN ANY RELATION
SHIM I TRY TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN
THE BOOK.
WAYS OF DOING THAT.
>> STEPHEN: I'M IN THE A
COMEDIAN.
I DON'T MAKE UP JOKES THAT
OFTEN.
I HAVE ONE JOKE ABOUT GOD.
I'D LIKE TO TRY IT ON YOU.
>> FEEL FREE.
>> STEPHEN: A GUY COMMITS
SUICIDE AND GOES TO HEAVEN,
OKAY?
HE GETS TO HEAVEN.
GOD GROW THES HIM THERE.
THE GUY SAYS I'M SO SURPRISED
I'M HERE.
FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT THERE WAS
NO GOD.
SECOND OF ALL, I THOUGHT IF YOU
KILLED YOURSELF, YOU KNOW, YOU
WERE DAMNED FOREVER.
GOD SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S A
COMPLICATED ISSUE.
EVERYBODY AT LEAST THINKS ABOUT
ENDING IT, YOU KNOW KILLING
THEMSELVES AT SOME POINT.
GOD SAID EVEN I THOUGHT OF IT.
THE GUY SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU DO
IT?
GOD SAID, WHAT IF THIS IS ALL
THERE IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> PRETTY GOOD.
>> STEPHEN: FATHER, THANK YOU
FOR JOINING ME.
FATHER JIM MARTIN.
