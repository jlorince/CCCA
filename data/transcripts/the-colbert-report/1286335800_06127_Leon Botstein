EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT BELIEVES
AMERICANS ARE SCIENCE ILL LIL
RAT.
SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE
HIT ILLIOUS HUMOR LEECHED.
PLEASE WELCOME LEON BOTSTEIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING THERE, LEON?
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: HOW YOU DOING?
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: NOW, LET'S
INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT
IN YOUR IMPRESSIVENESS.
YOU ARE A BIT OF A POLYMATH,
WHICH I BELIEVE MEANS YOU KNOW
MULTIPLE TYPES OF MATH, ADDING,
SUBTRACTING, THE WHOLE NINE
YARDS.
YOU'RE A CONDUCTOR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE
PRESIDENT OF BARD COLLEGE.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen: I BELIEVE YOU USED
TO PET A WHITE CAT AND PLAN
WORLD DOMINATION.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I GAVE IT UP.
I GAVE IT UP.
>> Stephen: HUMAN CANNON BALL
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
NOW YOU HAVE A... YOU WANT TO
SAVE OR REFORM OUR BROKEN SCHOOL
SYSTEMS IN AMERICA.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT'S WHERE
WE PART COMPANY.
I SAY JUST CUT 'EM LOOSE.
OKAY.
THEY'RE NOT WORKING, JUST
ELIMINATE THEM AND IN THE
JUNGLE.
IF THEY WANT TO LEARN, THEY
WILL.
>> WHO WILL GOVERN THE COUNTRY?
>> Stephen: WE WILL.
>> YEAH, BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS
THAT IN A DEMOCRACY, IN ORDER
FOR IT TO WORK AND FOR OUR FEEDZ
TO REALLY SURVIVE, YOU HAVE TO
HAVE A POPULATION THAT KNOWS
SOMETHING AND THAT ACTUALLY CAN
PARTICIPATE AND MAKE INTELLIGENT
DECISIONS.
>> Stephen: YOU BELIEVE THAT
WE ARE SCIENCE ILLITERATE AND
THAT YOU ARE MAKING IT MANDATORY
FOR FRESHMEN AT BARD TO TAKE A
THREE-WEEK INTENSIVE EIGHT HOURS
A DAY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK ON SOME
SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THESE
YOUNG PEOPLE?
>> THEY'RE GOING TO COME FOR
THREE WEEKS, AND THEY'RE GOING
TO STUDY WHAT MAKES AN
INFECTIOUS DISEASE INFECTIOUS,
HOW WOULD YOU CONTROL IT, YOU
KNOW, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BACTERIA
BECOMING...
>> Stephen: THEY'RE FRESHMEN
IN COLLEGE.
THEY'RE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ANYWAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> BUT THEY MIGHT LEARN HOW NOT
TO GET IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
BUT SO WHAT'S... FOR WHAT
PURPOSE, SIR?
>> THE PURPOSE IS BECAUSE MOST
OF THE DECISIONS WE MAKE
POLITICALLY ABOUT HEALTH CARE,
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, PERSONAL
CHOICES WE MAKE OURSELVES ARE
ABOUT EVALUATING DIFFERENT
CLAIMS.
AND WE WANT TO KNOW HOW SCIENCE
WORKS, WHAT IS EVIDENCE TO
PROCLAIM IT'S TRUE AND EVIDENCE
TO PROCLAIM IT ISN'T?
>> IT FEELS RIGHT.
IT FEELS RIGHT.
WE KNOW THAT IT...
>> THE EARTH FEELS FLAT.
IT ISN'T.
>> Stephen: IT DOES FEEL FLAT.
>> BUT IT ISN'T.
>> Stephen: BUT I HAPPEN TO
KNOW IT'S NOT BECAUSE I HAVE
BEEN UP IN A JET.
AND I HAVE SEEN THAT IT CURVES.
THEREFORE I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT
FLAT.
>> YEAH, BUT YOU COULD...
>> Stephen: CHECKMATE.
CHECKMATE.
>> FEW THERE ARE A LOT OF
THINGS... YOU'RE MADE OF D.N.A.
>> Stephen: I BELIEVE I'M MADE
OF NACHO CHEESE IF YOU ARE WHAT
YOU EAT.
I'M MADE OF D.N.A.?
>> D.N.A. IS THE ESSENTIAL
INFORMATION THAT HAS MADE YOU
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY IN EVERY
CELL.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> NOW, KNOWING HOW THAT WORKS
WILL HELP YOU, FOR EXAMPLE...
>>
>> Stephen: LIVE FOREVER?
>> MAYBE.
>> Stephen: MAYBE?
>> PROBABLY.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, BUT IT
WOULD PROBABLY HELP YOU...
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: THEN WHY THE BOW
TIE AND THE GLASSES?
YOU'RE REALLY ROCKING THE LOOK,
I'VE GOT TO SAY.
>> BECAUSE WHAT I'M INTERESTED
IN ISN'T EVERYTHING THAT I
SHOULD KNOW.
IN OTHER WORDS, AS A CITIZEN, I
MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN
AFGHANISTAN, BUT I SHOULD NOW
ABOUT AFGHANISTAN.
NOW WE HAVE WAR THERE.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> SO SCIENCE, I'M IN THE A
SCIENTIST, BUT I THINK PEOPLE
WHO BECOME CITIZENS OUGHT TO
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF
THINGS.
YOU ARE A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL
YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED.
YOU DON'T MIND PEOPLE THINKING
OF YOU AS AN EGGHEAD, AND I
DON'T MEAN THAT... I MEAN, YOU
DON'T MIND PEOPLE THINKING OF
YOU AS A SMARTY PANTS, BUT
AMERICANS, WE'RE NOT BIG ON
SMARTY PANTS.
DON'T GET ABOVE YOURSELF, SIR.
>> I DO MIND IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE ATTITUDE THAT THE SMARTY
PANTS IS SOMEBODY ELSE, I'D LIKE
THE THINK THE CITIZEN TO THINK
OF HIM OR HERSELF AS SOMEONE WHO
CAN MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS.
>> Stephen: DO I HAVE TO THINK
OF MYSELF INTELLIGENT, OR DO I
JUST HAVE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS
RIGHT.
BECAUSE I HAVE COMMON SENSE.
>> COMMON SENSE AND SCIENTIFIC
SENSE OFTENTIMES DON'T MIX
BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT WE
INTUITIVELY BELIEVE AS COMMON
SENSE ARE SOMETIMES WRONG, LIKE
THE EARTH BEING FLAT.
SMOKING PEOPLE THINK IS FUN.
>> Stephen: IT'S AS NATURAL AS
SMELLING A FLOWER.
>> TOBACCO IS NATURAL, ORGANIC,
IT FEELS GOOD.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE PUTTING
YOUR FACE IN A BOUQUET THAT'S ON
FIRE.
>> BUT BEING SO CRITICAL ABOUT
FIGURING OUT HOW YOU EVALUATE A
PROPOSITION, HOW SCIENTISTS...
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T EVALUATE
A PROPOSITION.
THEY SET THEIR PRICES.
YOU EITHER PAY OR YOU DON'T.
THEY DON'T LIKE THE HAGGLE.
LAST QUESTION, ABOUT CONDUCTING.
>> YEAH.
>> ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING UP
THERE WHEN YOU'RE WAVING YOUR
ARMS?
BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING I COULD
JUST GO UP THERE WITH A BATON
AND LIKE TRY THE SWAT AWAY A BEE
FOR FIVE MINUTES, AND THE
PHILHARMONIC WOULD STILL MAKE
THEIR WAY THROUGH.
>> IF IT WERE THE TACO BELL
CANNON, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
THE PERSON UP THERE IS JUST
SHOW.
THEY COULD DO IT THEMSELVES.
BUT SERIOUSLY CONDUCTING IS
PANTOMIME THAT MAKES SOUND,
ESPECIALLY THE PLAYERS ARE DOING
SOMETHING THAT THE AUDIENCE
DOESN'T REALLY REMEMBER.
IT'S NOT A TUNE THEY KNOW.
AND ALSO IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY...
A LOT OF INSTRUMENTS TRYING TO
MAKE A SINGLE FABRIC.
SO YOU REALLY ARE SHAPING A
SOUND, AND THAT SOUND IS BASED
ON INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT
EACH OF THEM HAS.
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING
SOMETHING WHEN THE MUSIC IS NOT
REALLY FAMILIAR OR VERY
COMPLICATED, LIKE AN OPERA.
THINGS HAPPENING ALL OVER, YOU
KNOW, THAT PEOPLE ON STAGE,
THERE ARE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, IN
THE PITS.
THEY'RE SINGING OFF STAGE.
IT'S DIRECTING TRAFFIC IN A VERY
SOPHISTICATED MANNER.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T NEED A
CONDUCTOR TO GET YOU THROUGH
THAT SYMPHONY OF WORDS?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: MR. BOTSTEIN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PRESIDENT OF BARD
