(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")>> STEPHEN: WELCOME!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY!
WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT, IHAVE BIG NEWS FOR YOU NOW.
YOU HAVE JOINED US ON ANHISTORIC NIGHT.
THIS WEEK MARKS THE40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
RESIGNATION OF RICHARD MILHOUSJOWLSWORTH NIXON.
(LAUGHTER)WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A BALLOON
DROP IN HIS HONOR, BUT, INSTEAD,WE JUST DECIDED TO SECRETLY DROP
THEM OVER CAMBODIA.
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS A SOLEMN DAY FOR ME
BECAUSE NIXON IS MY ALL-TIMEFAVORITE NON-REAGAN PRESIDENT,
NON-CHENEY VICE PRESIDENT, ANDNON-OATS QUAKER.
(LAUGHTER)TO THIS DAY, NIXON'S 1972
CAMPAIGN POSTER HANGS IN MYOFFICE.
IT REMINDS ME OF A SIMPLER TIMEIN AMERICA, WHEN MY PARENTS
SEEMED VERY TALL AND YOU'D GET AGOLD STAR JUST FOR USING THE
TOILET.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, BEFORE WE DELVE INTO THE
SO-CALLED SCANDAL THAT COST USTHIS GREAT LEADER, LET'S GET TO
KNOW THE MAN.
RICHARD NIXON WAS BORN IN 1913IN YORBA LINDA, CALIFORNIA.
EVEN AT AN EARLY AGE, HE REFUSEDTO WEAR MAKEUP, WHICH IS WHY
EVEN HIS MOTHER PREFERREDKENNEDY'S BABY PICTURES.
(LAUGHTER)AFTER SERVING IN THE NAVY, NIXON
WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND ROSETO POLITICAL PROMINENCE AS A
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE IN THE HOUSEUN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES
COMMITTEE, WHERE HE ACCUSEDSTATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALGER
HISS OF BEING A SOVIET SPY.
IT WAS A DARK TIME IN OURNATION'S HISTORY, WHEN IT WAS
CONSIDERED WRONG FOR GOVERNMENTWORKERS TO SPY ON AMERICANS.
(LAUGHTER) IN 1952, WHILECAMPAIGNING AS DWIGHT
EISENHOWER'S RUNNINGMATE, NIXON WAS GULFED INSCANDAL
WHEN THE MEDIA REPORTED HERECEIVED IMPROPER GIFTS FROM
WEALTHY DONORS.
SO NIXON TOOK TO THE AIR WAVESAND SAVED HIS REPUTATION WITH
WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THECHECKERS SPEECH ."
>> WE DID GET SOMETHING, A GIFTAFTER THE ELECTION.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS?
IT WAS A LITTLE COCKER SPANIELDOG, AND OUR LITTLE GIRL,
TRICIA, THE 6-YEAR-OLD, NAMED ITCHECKERS.
AND YOU KNOW, THE KIDS, LIKE ALLKIDS, LOVE THE DOG, AND I JUST
WANT TO SAY THIS RIGHT NOW THATREGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT IT, WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: THIS SPEECH WAS
THE MOST SKILLFUL POLITICALDEFLECTION SINCE STALIN'S
INFAMOUS "YES, I HAVE WORKCAMPS, BUT THEY'RE FILLED WITH
KITTENS."
(LAUGHTER)A TENDER MESSAGE.
NIXON LOST THE 1960 ELECTIONTO JOHN F. KENNEDY.
IN PART DUE TO A POORPERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST
TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.
KENNEDY CHOSE TO WEAR MAKEUP,WHILE NIXON CHOSE TO BE IN BLACK
AND WHITE.
(LAUGHTER)A ROOKIE MISTAKE.
BUT EIGHT YEARS LATER, NIXONPULLED OFF THE GREATEST
POLITICAL COMEBACK IN HISTORY,WHEN HE SWEPT INTO THE OVAL
OFFICE.
AS PRESIDENT, HIS ACHIEVEMENTSWERE MANY.
HE FOUNDED THE E.P.A., ENDEDSCHOOL SEGREGATION, LOWERED THE
VOTING AGE TO 18 AND ENDORSEDTHE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT.
BUT HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT WASRESTORING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WITH CHINA.
FOR WHICH WE OWE NIXON A LASTINGDEBT -- AND CHINA $1.3 TRILLION.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THIS GOOD MAN WAS FORCED
--(APPLAUSE)
YES.
YES. MAO MONEY, MAO PROBLEMS
