(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN IS BARELY UNDER WAY.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ALREADY RESORTING TO AD HOMONYM ATTACKS TRYING TO
DIVIDE THE COUNTRY JUST WHEN THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO UNITE US AGAINST HIM.
(LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY FOX & FRIENDS CHIEF FRIEND STEVE DOOCY ISN'T LETTING HIM GET AWAY
WITH IT.
TALKING WITH MITT ROMNEY ON THURSDAY, DOOCY QUOTED THE PRESIDENT'S BLATANT ATTACK ON MITT.
>> HE SAID UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE, I WASN'T BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN MY MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE, OH GEE, WHO COULD OBAMA POSSIBLY MEAN.
WE ALL KNOW WHEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE BEING BORN INTO PRIVILEGE IT CAN
ONLY MEAN MITT ROMNEY SO PETTY.
AND IT IS BOUND TO BACKFIRE ON THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE BEING BORN RICH IS MITT
ROMNEY'S GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT.
(LAUGHTER) AND I BELIEVE IT IS A COWARDLY STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT, MADE ALL THE MORE
COWARDLY BY THE FACT THAT HE NEVER ACTUALLY SAID IT.
>> THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT THE BEST UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES IN THE WORLD.
BECAUSE SOMEBODY DID THE GROUNDWORK.
WE CREATED A FOUNDATION FOR THOSE OF US TO PROSPER.
SOMEBODY GAVE ME AN EDUCATION.
I WASN'T BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN MY MOUTH.
MICHELLE WASN'T.
BUT SOMEBODY GAVE US A CHANCE.
>> Stephen: SO HE DIDN'T SAY "UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE", UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT WAS POOR JOURNALISM.
DOOSESY WAS PRACTICING JOURNALISM PLUS, BY QUOTING THE SUBTEXT.
IT WORKS LIKE THIS I DON'T GIVE OUT HAND JOBS AT THE BUS STATION.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) AND DOOCY'S SUBTEXT MUST HAVE SEEMED TRUE BECAUSE HIS VERSION WAS QUOTED VERBATIM
BY "THE NEW YORK POST" AND "THE WASHINGTON POST".
I BELIEVE IN JOURNALISM,
THAT'S CALLED PICKING UP A DEUCE WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.
NOW SURE, THE WHITE HOUSE CLAIMS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN USING THE SILVER
SPOON LINE SINCE 2009 ON THE TECHNICALITY THAT HE HAS.
>> FOLKS LIKE YOU AND ME,
GEORGE, WHO HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY BLESSED,
NEITHER OF US WERE BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN OUR MOUTHS.
>> YOU GUYS KNOW MY BACKGROUND.
WE DIDN'T COME TO THE SCENE-- WE DIDN'T COME TO THE SCENE WE A SILVER SPOON
IN OUR MOUTHS.
>> NEITHER HARRY OR I WERE BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN OUR MOUTH.
>> THAT IS THE REASON THE THREE OF US WERE STANDING HERE TODAY, NONE OF US WERE
BORN WAY SILVER SPOON IN OUR MOUTHS.
BUT WE GOT A GREAT EDUCATION.
>> Stephen: BUT JUST BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING IT SINCE 2009 DOESN'T
MEAN IT'S NOT ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.
HE'S BEEN RUNNING SINCE 2005.
(LAUGHTER) IN FACT, OBAMA'S BEEN TAKING POTSHOTS AT MITT ROMNEY ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS 2008
CAMPAIGN WITH HIS PASS OF A GRESSIVE SLOGAN, YES, WE CAN,
UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE.
(APPLAUSE) SO THAT, SO EXSLERNT REPORTING, STEVE DOOCY.
AND I KNOW GOOD REPORTING.
