>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU KNOW, I DON'TTHINK THERE'S ANY OTHER WAY
TO SAY IT AND THERE ISABSOLUTELY NO SUGARCOATING
IT AT THIS POINT.
CABLE NEWS RATINGS ARE RAPIDLYDECLINING.
I SAW THAT ON CNN WHICH ISWHY NOBODY HEARD ABOUT IT.
AND NO ONE HAS BEEN MOREAFFECTED THAN HLN FORMALLY
KNOWN AS HEADLINE NEWS.
MUCH LIKE HOW KFC WAS FORMALLYKNOWN AS THE LEARNING CHANNEL
>> RECENTLY THEY ANNOUNCED ASUREFIRE WAY TO BRING IN THE
YOUTH.
BECAUSE HLN WILL REFORMATAND REBRAND IN 2014 TO
BECOME THE FIRST TV NETWORKFOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA
GENERATION MILLENNIALS, ANDTHE MILLENNIAL MINDED.
YES, NOW HLN WILL CATERYOUNG PEOPLE INSTEAD OF JUST
SENDING NANCY GRACE AFTERMISSING WHITE ONES.
IN FACT, SHE CAN INTERNET UPHER SHOW RIGHT AWAY BY
CHANGING THE NAME TO ERROR404, BLOND GIRL NOT FOUND.
FOLKS, THIS SOCIAL MEDIAREBRAND FOR MILLENNIALS IS
THE BRAINCHILD OF HLNGENERAL MANAGER ALBIE HECHT.
WHOA!
WHOA, WHO LET IN #ASHTONKUTCHER TO RUN A NETWORK?
I CARLY HE'S SO RAVEN.
NOW ALBIE HERE OR AS HISMILLENNIAL BUDS CALL HIM,@SENIOR
DISCOUNT, HAS TO REBRANDEDHLN AS THE FIRST TV HOME TO
EMBRACE THE SOCIAL MEDIAGENERATION AND CHAMPION ITS
INTERESTS.
YES.
MILLENNIALS FAVORITE PLACETO GET THE INTERNET IS
ALWAYS TV.
I AM PUMPED FOR HLN NEWSHOWS LIKE KEYWORDS, A GAME
SHOW THAT ASKS CONTESTANTSTO IDENTIFY THE SEARCH TERM
WITH KEY WORD CLUES.
FOR INSTANCE.
REALITY STAR AND SEX TAPEARE KEY WORDS FOR THE ANSWER
KIM KARDASHIAN.
JUST LIKE THE SEARCH TERMDESPERATE AND TAILSPIN ARE
KEY WORDS FOR HLN.
THEN-- THEN THERE IS THESHOW ONE PERIOD CLICK PERIOD
AWAY WHICH REVEALS THEUNTOLD STORY BEHIND ON-LINE
CLASSIFIEDS.
LIKE THAT MISCONNECTION FROMTHE ANONYMOUS GUY WHO SAW
THE YOUNG WOMAN READINGGREAT EXPECTATIONS IN THE
UPTOWN TRAIN.
UNTOLD STORY, HE WANTED TOHAVE SEX WITH HER.
(LAUGHTER)BUT I THINK THE MOST
MILLENNIAL OF ALL IS HLN'SNEW APP #WHAT'S YOUR FOMO TO
COLLECT A LIST OF YOUR FOMO,FEAR OF MISSING OUT.
MY NUMBER ONE FOMO FEAR OFMISSING OUT ON ANYTHING ELSE
WHILE I'M WASTING MY LIFEON WHAT'S YOUR FOMO.
AN HLN NEW LINE-UP ISINSPIRED BY THE BEST IN
THE BIZ.  AS ALBIE HECHT TOLD"THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER", I
WATCH STEPHEN COLBERT.
TONALLY THAT'S AN ARENA WEWANT TO MOVE INTO AS AN
EDITORIAL VOICE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WOW.
STEPHEN COLBERT, I LOVE HISTONAL ARENA.
I HAD NO IDEA THESE SHOWSWERE MY FAULT.
FROM NOW ON, TCR IS GOING TOBE THE MOST MILLENNIALIZED
GEN Y-IFIED MULTISCREEN SNAPCHAT TWIT-O-VID
EVER BROADCAST BY A BOX INVENTEDIN 1927 BY A POTATO FARMER.
