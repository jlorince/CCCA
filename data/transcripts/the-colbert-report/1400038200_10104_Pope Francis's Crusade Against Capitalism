>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THEREPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )FOLKS-- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF
YOU WATCH THIS SHOW-- AND I HOPEYOU DO-- YOU KNOW THAT I AM
AMERICA'S MOST PROMINENTCATHOLIC.
MY FAITH IS SO STRONG, DOCTORSHAVE ACTUALLY CALLED IT A
MESSIAH COMPLEX.
( LAUGHTER )NOT TOO SHABBY.
BUT I'M ALSO AMERICA'S FOREMOSTCAPITALIST.
I LOVE THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THEMARKET SO MUCH I LET IT GET TO
THIRD BASE, WHICH IS WHY I HADPROBLEMS WITH POPE FRANCIS WHEN
HE CALLED CAPITALISM A NEWTYRANNY CAUSED BY THE IDOLATRY
OF MONEY.
IDOLATRY!
I WOULD NEVER WORSHIP MONEY.
THE DOLLAR IS NOT WORTH THEPAPER IT'S PRINTED ON.
THAT'S WHY I'VE INVESTEDEVERYTHING IN GOLDEN CALF
FUTURES.
( LAUGHTER )AS A CATHOLIC, I TRY TO GIVE THE
POPE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
SO DOES BILL O'REILLY.
>> THE FAR LEFT IS DISTORTINGHIS WORDS, TRYING TO CO-OPT THE
POPE TO IMPOSE SO-CALLEDECONOMIC JUSTICE, WHICH IS
REALLY SOCIALISM, FORCEFULLYTAKING FROM THE HAVES AND GIVING
TO THE HAVE-NOTS.
I CAN TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTYTHAT POPE FRANCIS OPPOSES THAT
FORM OF TYRANNY AS MUCH AS THEPOLISH POPE JOHN PAUL DID.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, PAPA BEARKNOWS WHAT'S IN POPE-A BEAR'S
HEART.
NO REDISTRIBUTION, NO SOCIALISM.
>> BREAKING NEWS, POPE FRANCISCALLED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH TO THE POOR.
IF YOU'RE SAYING TAKE IT FROMHERE, GIVE IT TO THERE,
EXPROPRIATE, I DON'T KNOW WHATTHAT IS BUT SOCIALISM.
>> Stephen:  SON OF A BISHOP!
THE POPE IS A SOCIALIST!
I MEAN, IN RETROSPECT, I SHOULDHAVE KNOWN.
HE LIVES IN EUROPE AND HE GIVESHIS EMPLOYEES A ONE-DAY WORK
WEEK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
HE CAN'T DO THIS.
BECAUSE EITHER THE POPE IS WRONGOR GOD'S A COMMIE.
( LAUGHTER )WAIT A SECOND-- COME TO THINK OF
IT, HE DOES LOOK AN AWFUL LOTLIKE KARL MARX.
PLUS, JESUS WAS A CARPENTER.
THAT'S WHY HE'S HOLDING AHAMMER, BUT, JIMMY, WHAT'S
IN HIS OTHER HAND?
A SICKLE!
NO!
( APPLAUSE )NO, NO, NO.
I REFUSE.
THIS CANNOT BE RIGHT.
I MEAN, WHERE IS IT WRITTEN THATI CAN'T LOVE BOTH GOD AND MONEY?
I MEAN BESIDES IN MATTHEW WHEREJESUS SAYS YOU CANNOT SERVE
GOD AND MONEY.
( LAUGHTER )I GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
CHOOSE, MONEY OR JESUS.
I GUESS I'LL FLIP A COIN.
( LAUGHTER )THERE YOU HAVE IT.
IT CAME UP MONEY.
