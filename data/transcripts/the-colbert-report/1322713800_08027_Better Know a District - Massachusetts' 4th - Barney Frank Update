FOLKS, ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I'LL
BE SAD TO SEE CONGRESSMAN FRANK
GO. SURE, WE DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE
EYE TO EYE, BUT HE WAS ONE OF
THE FIRST CONGRESSMAN I GOT TO
BETTER KNOW.
SO TO HONOR HIS RETIREMENT, I'M
PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS ENCORE
PRESENTATION OF MY SECOND-EVER
"BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT."
THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME
BETWEEN TAXING AND SPENDING TO
TALK TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CONGRESSMAN BARNEY -- CAN I CALL
YOU FRANK?
>> IT'S MY LAST NAME.
SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.
>> STEPHEN: PRESIDENT BUSH,
GREAT PRESIDENT OR THE GREATEST
PRESIDENT?
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS
I'VE GOT.
>> I THINK HE'S BEEN A DISASTER.
>> STEPHEN: I'LL PUT YOU DOWN
FOR GREAT.
>> WELL, I --
>> STEPHEN: IT'S THE LOWER OF
THE TWO.
SO I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR IT.
BUSH IS GREAT.
BARNEY FRANK 22ND SEPTEMBER,
2005.
OKAY.
YOU ARE SELF-IDENTIFIED AS A
GROUP THAT HAS A LOT OF
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM.
WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE LIVING
YOUR LIFE OPENLY LEFT HANDED?
>> VERY DIFFICULT.
PENCIL SHARPENERS, FOR INSTANCE,
ARE RIGHT HANDED.
>> STEPHEN: SCISSORS.
>> DOOR KNOBS.
>> STEPHEN: I WAS BORN LEFT
HANDED.
BY THE WAY, I BELIEVE YOU ARE
BORN LEFT HANDED IT'S IN THE A
DECISION.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: MY PARENTS,
ESPECIALLY MY DAD WERE PRETTY
UPSET.
THEY DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR
POWER TO GET ME TO SWITCH SIDES
AND GO RIGHT HANDED.
THEY EVEN GOT ME INVOLVED IN
THIS CHRISTIAN MINISTRY YOUTH
GROUP TO GET ME ME TO GO OVER TO
THE RIGHT SIDE.
HAS YOUR MINISTER EVER
APPROACHED YOU ABOUT CHANGING
FROM LEFT TO RIGHT?
>> MY MINISTER IS A RABBI.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE JEWISH?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: TO SUM UP, YOU ARE
LEFT HANDED, JEWISH, AS I LEARN
HERE, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
ABOUT YOU AND THIS IS SORT OF
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THAT
I'M NOT NAMING BUT AS A
JOURNALIST I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO
NAME IT:  YOU ARE A LITTLE
OVERWEIGHT.
DOES YOUR WIFE LIKE THAT YOU ARE
OVERWEIGHT?
>> I CAN HONESTLY SAY TO YOU
WHETHER OR NOT I LOSE WEIGHT IS
OF NO CONCERN WHATSOEVER TO MY
WIFE.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
YOU'VE BEEN CALLED FAIRLY HIP.
WHAT IS THE LAST CD YOU BOUGHT?
>> I DON'T THINK I EVER BOUGHT
ONE.
MY BOYFRIEND GAVE ME SOME.
>> JON: SORRY WHAT?
>> MY BOYFRIEND GAVE ME ONE.
>> STEPHEN: OH, YOU ARE
HOMOSEXUAL.
MY APOLOGIES.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
FOR NOT KNOWING.
>> WHY WOULD I BE OFFENDED BY
THE FACT I DIDN'T KNOW.
>> STEPHEN: PLEASE -- I
APOLOGIZE FOR APOLOGIZING.
>> LET ME EXPLAIN THE NICE THING
ABOUT ME.
IGNORANCE DOES NOT OFFEND ME.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH AS A JOURNALIST I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN THAT SO IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE TELL ME WHO
ELSE IS GAY.
>> ELTON JOHN.
LET ME THINK ABOUT ELSE WHO.
ELLEN DEGENERES.
>> STEPHEN: THE ONE WHO
DANCES?
>> YES.
