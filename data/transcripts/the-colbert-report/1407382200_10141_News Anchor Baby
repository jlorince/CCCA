>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, AS APROFESSIONAL NEWSMAN I'M
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR INNOVATIONSIN JOURNALISM.
FROM THE FUTURISTIC NEWSDESKOF SHEP SMITH TO THE 3D
ENVIRONMENT OF WOLF BLITZER TOWHATEVER ALUMINUM
ALLOY ANDERSON COOPER ISSCULPTED FROM.
TODAY I SAW A TROUBLINGGLIMPSE OF BROADCASTING
FUTURE AND LIKE MOSTTROUBLING THINGS I SAW IT AT
A COUNTY FAIR.
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUTTHE RIDE.
>> IT WAS GREAT, ANDAPPARENTLY, I'VE NEVER BEEN
ON LIVE TELEVISION BEFORE.
BUT APPARENTLY SOMETIMES IDON'T WATCH-- I DON'T WATCH
THE NEWS, BECAUSE I'M A KIDAND APPARENTLY EVERY TIME,
APPARENTLY GRANDPA JUSTGIVES ME THE REMOTE AFTER WE
WATCH OT POWERBALL.
AND I'VE NEVER, EVER BEEN ONLIVE TELEVISION.
I NEVER EVER BEEN ON LIVETELEVISION.
>> ARE YOU EXCITED.
>> YEAH, AND APPARENTLY IALREADY WENT DOWN THE
SUPERSLIDE.
I WENT DOWN, I WAS SCAREDHALF TO DEATH.
>> OH MY GOD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THIS KID IS A
NATURAL-BORN NEWSMAN.
I MEAN HE'S ALREADY BREAKINGTHE STORY OF HOW THE
SUPERSLIDE IS HALF DEATHSCARING OUR CHILDREN.
AND FOLKS, YOU WOULDN'T KNOWIT FROM THAT INTERVIEW BUT
APPARENTLY THIS CHILD HASNEVER BEEN ON LIVE
TELEVISION BEFORE.
NOW I ALREADY ANNOUNCED THISSPRING THAT I WAS ENDING
THIS SHOW.
BUT I HAVEN'T FULLYEXPLAINED WHY.
I KNOW, I KNOW, THAT'S HOW IFEEL WHEN I LOOK IN THE
MIRROR.
ONE REASON I'M ENDING THESHOW IS THAT WHEN I CALLED
COMCAST TO GET OUT OF MYCABLE SUBSCRIPTION IT TURNED
IT WAS EASIER FOR ME JUSTTO GET OUT OF CABLE ALL
TOGETHER.
BUT NOW-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT NOW I FINALLY,HUGE COMCAST FANS HERE.
BUT NOW I'VE GOT AN EVENBETTER REASON.
NEWS ANCHOR BABIES LIKE THISARE BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.
AT 5 YEARS OLD HE'S ALREADYGOT THE SINCERITY OF EDWARD R
MURROW, THE REASSURING GAZEOF WALTER CRONKITE AND MORE
GRAVITAS THAN STEVE DOOCY.
AND HE'S ALREADY ESTABLISHEDTHE WORD "APPARENTLY" AS HIS
CATCH-PHRASE.
THAT IS THE SORT OFSENSELESS REPETITION THAT
MARKS A REAL NEWS LEGENDLIKE SEAN HANNITY.
>> WE WERE AT ANOTHER IRONDOME LOCATION, REMEMBER
THERE'S NINE OF THEM THATLITERALLY COVER THE ENTIRE
STATE OF ISRAEL, LITERALLYWE HEARD AN IRON DOME GO OFF,
WE LITERALLY WENT TO THEBORDER, LITERALLY IF YOU ARE
5, 10 YOU COULD WALK IN THATTINL.
I LITERALLY WALKED DOWN ASLOPE.
>> I LITERALLY WALKED.
>> LITERALLY
>> LITERALLY.
>> LITERALLY BEHIND ME.
>> Stephen: APPARENTLY-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
APPARENTLY THATFIVE-YEAR-OLD CHILD COULD
REPLACE SEAN HANNITY.
LITERALLY.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
