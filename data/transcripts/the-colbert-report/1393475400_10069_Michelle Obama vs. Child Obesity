NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR THAT GREETING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, I AM SO GLAD, I AMSO GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE
HAPPY BECAUSE I USED TO BEHAPPY.
BUT I LEARNED SOMETHINGTODAY THAT SHOOK ME TO MY
CORE.
AND ONCE MY CORE IS SHAKEN,DON'T COME A KNOCKING.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S THE DEAL.
REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME IMENTIONED IN PASSING THAT
OBAMA IS PLOTTING TORADICALLY ALTER THE
FOUNDER'S VISION FORAMERICA?
HE IS. BEN FRANKLIN WOULD BEHORRIFIED BY OBAMACARE.
IT DOESN'T EVEN COVERLEECH-CRAFT OR BONE PURGING
FOR FEMALE HYSTERIA.
BUT FOLKS WHAT IS MOSTINSIDIOUS ABOUT OBAMA'S
AGENDA IS HOW IT ISBRAINWASHING OUR CHILDREN.
TAKE MICHELLE OBAMA'S LET'SMOVE CAMPAIGN TO COMBAT
CHILDHOOD OBESITY.
OH 'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
NO, THAT'S NORTH KOREANDICTATOR KIM JONG UN.
IT'S SO EASY TO MISTAKETHOSE TWO, THEY BOTH LOOK
GREAT IN PANT SUITS.
(LAUGHTER)OH, AND DEAR LEADER HAS HIS
OWN VERY EFFECTIVEANTI-OBESITY PROGRAM.
HE IS THE ONLY ONE IN NORTHKOREA WHO GETS TO EAT.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, NATION, I AM SAD TO
SAY THAT I AM TERRIFIED TOREPORT THAT GENERALISIMA
MICHELLE IS WINNING THEBATTLE OF THE BABY BULGE.
>> A BIG STEP FORWARD IN THEBATTLE AGAINST CHILDHOOD
OBESITY.
A NEW STUDY USING FEDERALDATA SAYS OBESITY IN
CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES 2AND 5 HAS DRAMATICALLY
DECREASED.
OVER 40% IN A DECADE.
THIS REPORT COMES OUT JUSTAS THE FIRST LADY'S LET'S
MOVE PROGRAM TO IMPROVEKID'S FITNESS LEVELS AND
EATING HABITS MARKS ITSFOURTH ANNIVERSARY.
>> OVER 40% IN A DECADE.
NATION, I BELIEVE THECHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE.
AND THANKS TO MICHELLE OBAMAAMERICA NOW HAS 40% LESS
TOMORROW.
THAT'S JUST MATH.
THAT'S JUST MATH.
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T UNDERSTAND A FIRST
LADY ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING.
EVERYTHING THEY DO ISSUPPOSED TO BE A SYMBOLIC
WASTE OF TIME.
(LAUGHTER)LIKE NANCY REAGAN'S WAR ON
DRUGS OR LAURA BUSH'S FIGHTTO END PRESIDENTIAL
ILLITERACY.
(LAUGHTER)WELL--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)LADY AND GENTLEMEN, THANKS
TO MISS OBAMA INSTEAD OFCARE-FREE CHUBSTERS, WE
ARE NOW BREEDING A
GENERATION OF BODY CONSCIOUSTOTS DOING TRICYCLE SPIN
CLASSES DESPERATELY TRYINGTO GET BACK TO THEIR BIRTH
WEIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)WORST OF ALL THIS IS BAD
NEWS FOR THE GOP.
THEY NEED TO REACH OUT TOTHE PRESCHOOL DEMO.
AND IT WON'T BE EASY SINCETHE REPUBLICANS ARE ON
RECORD AS TRYING TO DEPORTDORA.
AND THEY CONDEMN SPONGEBOBAS A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL.
PLUS PRESCHOOL ITSELF IS ALEFT WING SOCIALIST TRAINING
CAMP.
SHARING TOYS, SNACK HANDOUTS,PREMARITAL NAPPING, NOT TO
MENTION WASTEFULINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.
YOU'RE OVERBUDGET, SAM.
THAT THING'S NOT EVENDINOSAUR PROOF.
WE CAN STILL WIN THEM OVER,FOLKS.
I THINK THEY'LL REALLYIDENTIFY WITH THE CURRENT
CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIC MESSAGE:MINE!
