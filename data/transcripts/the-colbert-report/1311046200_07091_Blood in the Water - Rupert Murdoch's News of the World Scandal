>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
NATION, WE ALL KNOW IT IS NO SECRET AND I SAID IT MANY,
MANY TIMES THAT THE MEDIA IS LIBERAL.
NOT HOW HEADLINES ALWAYS START ON THE LEFT?
AND ANY TIME A CONSERVATIVE GETS IN TROUBLE LIKE RUPERT MURDOCH, OWNER OF NEWS
CORPORATE AND RUMOR HAS IT THE WORLD'S LARGEST HUMAN ZOO, THE LIBERAL MEDIA STARTS CIRCLING.
THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
>> SHARK, SHARK.
SHARK, SHARK, SHARK.
SHARK.
MURDOCH'S BRITISH TABLOID-- TABLOID "NEWS OF THE WORLD" ILLEGALLY HACKED
INTO THE VOICE-MAILS OF CELEBRITY, MURDER VICTIMS AND SOLDIER'S FAMILIES IN A
DISGRACEFUL INVASION OF PRIVACY.
OR AS THE BRITISH SAYLOREES.
SO MURDOCH SHUT DOWN "NEWS OF THE WORLD" AND FOR SOME REASON THE MEDIA CONTINUED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS PIFFLE.
>> FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NEWS INTERNATIONAL REBEKAH BROOK WAS ARRESTED.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN TEN ARRESTS SO FAR.
>> THERE AN FBI INVESTIGATION ONGOING.
THE SEC MAY INVESTIGATE.
THERE ARE PEOPLE CALLING FOR MURDOCH TO BE UP IN FRONT OF CONGRESS.
>> THE FIRESTORM ENGULFING TWO OF BRITAIN'S TOP COPS AND STILL THREATENING EVEN
THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON.
>> HEAD OF SCOTLAND YARD STEPPED DOWN AMID PUBLIC OUTRAGE YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen: BIG DEAL.
WHO CARES IF THE HEAD OF SCOTLAND YARD RESIGNS.
WHY IS SCOTLAND YARD POLICING ENGLAND ANYWAY?
CALL ME WHEN THE HEAD OF ENGLAND YARD RESIGNS.
THAT'S NEWS.
NOW THANKFULLY, FOLKS, THERE IS A VOICE OF REASON OUT THERE.
BOSTON FRIEND STEVE DOOCY WHO LAST FRIDAY BLEW THE LID BACK ON TO THIS STORY WITH
SOME PR GUY WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE EMPLOYED BY RUPERT MURDOCH.
JIMMY, PITCH ME OFF A DEUCE.
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT THIS PARTICULAR HACKING SCANDAL WITH THE NEWS OF THE WORLD.
>> THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD" IS A HACKING SCANDAL T CAN'T
BE DENIED BUT THE ISSUE REALLY IS WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE PILING ON AT THIS POINT.
>> AVENUE'S GOT SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
WE ARE TEETERING ON DEFAULT WITH.
WHAT DO THEY DO.
THEY TALK ABOUT THIS.
>> WE KNOW IT IS A HACKING SCANDAL.
SHOULDN'T WE GET BEYOND IT AND REALLY DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF HACKING?
I MEAN CITICORP HAS BEEN HACKED INTO.
BANK OF AMERICA HAS BEEN HACKED INTO.
I THINK ANY OF THE SAME KIND OF ATTENTION FOR HACKING THAT TOOK PLACE LESS THAN A
YEAR AGO THAT NEWS CORP. IS GETTING TODAY.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
THOSE BANK FILES WERE HACKED AND NEWS CORPORATE HACK MOOD PEOPLE'S PHONES.
THEY'RE BOTH VICTIMS OF BEING IN THE SAME SENTENCE WITH THE WORD "HACK" (LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND FOCUSING ON MURDOCH JUST OBSCURES ALL THE OTHER BIG HACKING NEWS OUT THERE.
COLD AND FLU SEASON IS COMING.
THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO HACKING.
CABDRIVERS USED TO BE CALLED HACKS.
WHY DOES NO ONE USE THAT WORD ANY MORE?
AND IF REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT HACKS IT, WHAT ABOUT THESE PEOPLE?
WHERE IS THAT STORY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO MOVE ON MEDIA MONSTERS THIS STORY IS DONE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
