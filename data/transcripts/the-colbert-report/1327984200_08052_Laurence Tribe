>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW AT HARVARD WHO TAUGHT
PRESIDENT BAMA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
THOSE WHO CAN DO, THOSE WHO
CAN ALSO BECOME PROFESSORS
AT INSTITUTIONAL
LAW-- CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT
HARVARD WHO TAUGHT PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
PLEASE WELCOME LAWRENCE
TRIBE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PROFESSOR TRIBE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU ARE A BIG MUCKY MUCK IN
THE WORLD OF CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW.
AS I SAID YOU TAUGHT
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
HE ALSO WORKED FOR YOU,
RIGHT.
>> HE WAS MY RESEARCH
ASSISTANT FOR A WHILE.
>> Stephen: WAS IT HARD AS A
YOUNG MAN, WAS IT HARD TO
UNDERSTAND HIM THROUGH THAT
THICK KENYAN ACCENT?
>> IT WAS THE HAWAIIAN AGO
IS SENT THAT I FOUND A
LITTLE HARD.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> STARTING EVERY SENTENCE
WITH ALOHA.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU ALSO TAUGHT
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS.
>> HE WAS A QUIETER GUY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: BUT HE SPOKE
VOLUMES WITH HIS EYES I BET.
IT WAS HARD TO TEACH HIM
BECAUSE THOSE CRYSTAL BLUE
THINGS.
>> I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF
WHAT I TAUGHT ACTUALLY,
ACTUALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
REALLY.
SO HIS, YOU DON'T SEE YOUR
INFLUENCE IN HIS DECISIONS.
>> ACTUALLY, WHEN HE WAS
SWEARING IN THE PRESIDENT I
FELT PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW,
ONE GUY I TAUGHT SWEARING
THE OTHER AND THEN THEY BOTH
GOT THE OATH WRONG.
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I REALLY
SCREWED UP.
>> Stephen: WHEN TEACHING
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW YOU
SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> I TRIED.
I TRIED.
>> Stephen: NOW.
>> IT'S SHORT.
>> Stephen: THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> YEAH, VERY SHORT.
>> Stephen: HOW IMPORTANT IS
IT BECAUSE-- SERIOUSLY,
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT A LOT.
AND THERE ARE GREAT THINGS
IN THERE, LINE, LIBERTY,
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, FOUR
SCORE IN SEVEN YEARS, BEER
BEFORE LIQUOR, ALL THE GOOD
STUFF IS IN THERE.
BUT HOW IS IT IMPORTANT FOR
US TO KNOW IT ON A DAILY,
HOW DOES IT AFFECT MY LIFE
ON A DAILY BASIS.
>> IT KEEPS THE GOVERNMENT
OUT OF YOUR BEDROOM.
IT KEEPS THE-- .
>> Stephen: NOT ALWAYS.
>> NOT ALWAYS, RIGHT.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU
ARE JUST-- YOU KNOW, BEING A
NORMAL HUMAN BEING, LIVING
YOUR LIFE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS A NORMAL
PERSON IN THEIR BEDROOM,
LARRY.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S NONE
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS
THAT IS THE MAIN POINT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I WILL BUY
THAT.
>> BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT
DOCUMENT IT SORT OF SETS UP,
IT'S A BLUEPRINT FOR THE WAY
THE GOVERNMENT WORKS.
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK GREAT,
BUT BETTER THAN A LOT OF
OTHER COUNTRIES.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT AN
ARTICLE IN HERE, I SUBSCRIBE
FOR THE ARTICLE IT IS CALLED
AMERICA'S CONSTITUTIONAL
NARRATIVE.
NOW IN THIS YOU SAY THE
CONSTITUTION IS NOT A KNOWN.
IT'S A VERB.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES IT
MEAN TO CONSTITUTION.
>> YOU KNOW, YOU SORT OF
LIVE THE CONSTITUTION, YOU
DON'T JUST LOOK AT IT.
IT'S A WAY WE DO THINGS.
IT'S THE WAY WE CONDUCT OUR
LIVES.
>> Stephen: ARE WE
CONSTITUTIONING RIGHT NOW?
>> WE'RE SORT OF
INSTITUTING-- INSTITUTING,
SOMETHING, YEAH, BUT THE WAY
THE CONSTITUTION WORKS IT
SORT OF SETS UP A GOVERNMENT
AND THEN IT PUTS TOGETHER A
FRAMEWORK AND THEN WE HAVE
TO LIVE IT.
IT DOESN'T ANSWER ALL YOUR
QUESTIONS.
>> Stephen: YES, IT DOES.
>> WELL, THEN-- .
>> Stephen: I'M A
CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINALIST,
ALONG WITH SCALIA, OKAY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I DO NOT THINK,
YOU THINK THIS IS A LIVING
DOCUMENT.
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S
A DEAD DOCUMENT.
I THINK, THE COOL THING
ABOUT IT IS WE CAN ARGUE
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS.
A LOT OF IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE
LIBERTY WHAT IS LIBERTY.
>> Stephen: FREEDOM.
>> WHAT IS EQUALITY, FREEDOM
TO DO WHAT.
>> Stephen: BE FREE.
>> YEAH, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS THAT TOO
TOUGH.
COY TEACH AT HARVARD.
RIGHT?
>> YES, COULD I TAKE YOUR
CLASS.
>> Stephen: YOU SURE COULD.
YOU ARE TAKING MY CLASS
RIGHT NOW, MISTER.
>> I CAN SENSE THAT
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MY FAVORITE
DECISION IS CITIZENS UNITED.
OKAY, I LOVE THAT.
>> I CAN SEE THAT OKAY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE AS WE
KNOW SANTAA COLLAR
LaSOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
>> WHETHER CORPORATIONS ARE
PERSONS ARE OR NOT T DOESN'T
NECESSARILY DECIDE THE CASE.
THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT
WHOEVER IS TALKING WHETHER
IT'S A CORPORATION OR
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO
HEAR WHAT IT IS SAYING.
AND SO EVEN IF WE SAID IN
THE CONSTITUTION
CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PERSONS,
THE LAW WOULDN'T CHANGE.
THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE IT IS
TO GET THE COURT TO
RECOGNIZE THAT DEMOCRACY IS
THREATENED BY THE FLOOD OF
MONEY.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE
CERTAINLY SHOULD DO IS MAKE
SURE THAT WHO THEY ARE GETS
DISCLOSED.
IT'S NOT TRANSPARENT SO WE
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VIACOM
TALKING OR IF IT'S GENERAL
MOTORS TALKING OR IF IT'S
CHRYSLER TALKING IT OUGHT TO
BE TRANSPARENT.
>> Stephen: BUT THEN THE
VOTERS MIGHT TAKE OUT ON THE
PERSON WHO GAVE THE MONEY.
>> THAT WOULD BE EXACTLY
RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S TERRORISM.
>> NO, A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULDN'T WANT SOME OF THIS
CRAP TO GO OUT IF THEY HAD
TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH
IT.
>> THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW,
ARE YOU GOING TO --
>> WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE
AMENDMENT.
>> I THINK THE NINTH, THAT'S
MY FAVORITE.
>> Stephen: MINE'S THE 19th.
>> IN FRANCHISING WOMEN,
THAT'S GOOD TOO.
>> Stephen: THAT'S GOOD TOO.
>> YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY YOU LIKE THE
NINTH AMENDMENT.
>> WHAT.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO
KNOW WHY I LIKE THE NINTH
AMENDMENT.
>> Stephen: NOT
PARTICULARLY.
WHY DO YOU LIKE THE NINTH
AMENDMENT,.
>> BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT
STLAS ARE THINGS IN THE
CONSTITUTION THAT HAVEN'T
BEEN FIGURED OUT YET THERE
ARE ING THISES THAT AREN'T
WRITTEN DOWN LIKE PRIVACY.
>> Stephen: SO THE NINTH
AMENDMENT JUST BASICALLY
SAYS OR WHATEVER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: FROM THE HARVARD
LAW SCHOOL, LAWRENCE TRIBE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
