(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
FOLKS, IF YOU'RE JUST JOININGOUR PROGRAM ALREADY IN PROGRESS,
BEFORE THE HALFTIME BREAK, I WASTAKING IT HOT AND HARD TO THE
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARDFOR ALLOWING NORTHWESTERN
UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS TOFORM A UNION.
IF ONE OF THOSE THUGS WERE HERE,I WOULD GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY
MIND.
HERE TO RECEIVE MY MINDPIECE, PLEASE WELCOME FORMER
LINEBACKER FOR UCLA AND HEAD OFTHE COLLEGE ATHLETES PLAYERS
ASSOCIATION, RAMOGI HUMA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE!
>> YOU READY FOR MY BLITZ?
YOU READY!
YOU READY!
YOU IN MY HOUSE!
YOU IN MY HOUSE!
FIRST OF ALL, I DO THAT TO ALLMY GUESTS.
WE USUALLY JUST EDIT IT OUT.
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PUSHINGFOR THIS UNION THING.
NOW WHEN FOOTBALL GOES AWAYFOREVER, I CAN BLAME UNIONS
INSTEAD OF CONCUSSION.
RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)SO WHY DO YOU FOLKS WANT COLLEGE
PLAYERS TO GET PAID A SALARY?
>> OUR POSITION IS THAT COLLEGEATHRETES ARE ALREADY PAID.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU WANTMORE, THEN?
>> WELL, THERE ARE THINGS THATAREN'T PROVIDED.
FOR INSTANCE, IF A COLLEGEATHLETE GETS INJURED, THEY'RE
NOT GUARANTEED MEDICAL EXPENSES.
>> Stephen: WALK IT OUT, TOUGHIT OUT.
FIND THE EXTRA GEAR. DO THESEWORDS MEAN NOTHING?
>> IF THEY GO OUT AND GET HURT,THEY GET STUCK WITH MEDICAL
EXPENSES AND FORMER PLAYERSDON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SUPPORT
THEM AS WELL.
THEY GENERATE MULTI-BILLIONDOLLARS, AND THE NCAA FACE THE
SAME RISK AS THE PRO GUYS.
THEY FOUND CTE WHICH IS ACONDITION THEY FOUND IN OTHER
PLAYERS.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES BRAINDAMAGE HAVE TO DO WITH
UNIONIZING?
IF THERE WAS MORE BRAIN DAMAGE,THE PLAYERS WOULDN'T THINK TO
UNIONIZE(LAUGHTER)
>> THE NFL PLAYERS HAVE A UNIONAND ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE
THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.
A COLLEGE ATHLETE COMMITTEDSUICIDE, THEY FOUND BRAIN
TRAUMA, AND AT THIS POINT WE SEETHE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR
INDUSTRY TO GET COMPREHENSIVEPROTECTION, WE FORM A UNION.
>> Stephen: NO ONE IS FORCINGTHE PLAYERS TO PLAY.
THEY JUST SAY, HEY, I DON'T WANTTO BE IN THIS SITUATION.
WHY DON'T I, SAY, BE A THEATERMAJOR?
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
POINT, BUT IN AMERICA, YOU KNOW,EMPLOYEES, NO ONE IS FORCED TO
GO TO THEIR JOB, BUT IT DOESN'TMEAN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A VOICE
IN YOUR WORKPLACE FORPROTECTION.
>> Stephen: WHAT -- IF PLAYERSUNIONIZE --
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)BUT IF PLAYERS, YOU KNOW,
UNIONIZE, WE'VE SEEN WHAT UNIONSHAVE DONE TO EMPLOYMENT IN THE
UNITED STATES, ALREADY.
ARE YOU READY FOR THE OHIO STATEUNIVERSITY'S FRONT LINE TO BE
OUTSOURCED?
YOU READY FOR THAT?
YOU GO TO THE GAME, YOU HEARON THE LOUD SPEAKER, HELLO, MY
NAME IS KEVIN(IN A MIDDLE EASTERN ACCENT)
>> Stephen: WON'T UNIVERSITIESJUST NO LONGER GIVE FULL
SCHOLARSHIPS TO GET AROUND THERULING THE SAME WAY EMPLOYERS
DON'T HAVE FULL-TIME EMPLOYEESTO GET AROUND THE ObamaCare
REQUIREMENT?
>> THAT'S NOT REALLY IN THEBOOK.
THIS IS A VERY LUCRATIVE,MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY,
SO THERE IS ACTUALLY ANINCENTIVE TO DRAW RECRUITS IN
AND THE WAY YOU DRAW THEM IN ISOFFER THEM A SCHOLARSHIP OR
MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'S NOT INEXCHANGE FOR SERVICES.
THEY'RE STUDENT ATHLETES.
THAT'S THE TERM YOU SEEM TO BEMISSING OUT ON.
STUDENT ATHLETES, NOT EMPLOYEES.
STUDENT ATHLETES.
WHAT PART OF STUDENT ATHLETEDON'T YOU GET?
(LAUGHTER)>> THEY'RE STUDENTS --
>> Stephen: YES.
THEY'RE ATHLETES.
>> Stephen: I ACCEPT YOURAPOLOGY, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
RAMOGI HUMA FROM THE COLLEGEATHLETES PLAYERS ASSOCIATION!
