(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> DRIVE AROUND TO THE SECOND WINDOW, PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: HELLO!
HOW'S IT GOING?
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> Stephen: COME IN THIS WAY.
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT?
(LAUGHS) YOU'RE GOOD.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
>> HOW'S IT GOING?
>> Stephen: HOLD ON ONE SECOND,
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
>> OKAY.
>> HELLO, HOW'S IT GOING?
>> Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU FOR DOING THE SHOW.
SNAP
>> YOU LOOK AMAZING.
>> Stephen: SO DO YOU, YOU'RE EXCELLENT.
NOW, SANTIGOLD, I'M FASCINATED BY YOUR STORY BECAUSE YOU STARTED OFF LIKE A RECORD EXECUTIVE.
YOU WERE SCOUTING OTHER BANDS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE RECORD EXECUTIVE, WOULD YOU FIND YOU OR
DO YOU NOW SEEM LIKE A RISK TO YOU THEN?
>> I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE SIGNED ME.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> BECAUSE I'M A RISK TAKER AND THAT'S WHY I WASN'T A GOOD RECORD EXECUTIVE.
BUT BACK THEN....
>> Stephen: HOW LONG AGO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
>> THIS IS IN THE '90s.
BUT THIS WAS WHEN PUFFY... P.
DIDDY... I DON'T KNOW, WHAT...
WELL HE WAS P. DIDDY THEN.
IT WAS JUST A RACE TO ANYTHING HE TOUCHED WAS LIKE SIGN THIS,
SIGN THIS, SIGN THIS.
>> Stephen: DID HE TOUCH YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, HE DIDN'T.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID "I DIDN'T SEE MYSELF AS A SONGWRITER, I
FELT MYSELF AS A SONGWRITER." I ADMIRED THAT.
I THINK... I LIKE COMING FROM THE GUT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU SING FROM THE GUT?
>> IN THE WRITING PROCESS I DEFINITELY... THE IMPULSE IS FROM THE GUT.
LIKE, THERE'S NO THOUGHT IN IT AT ALL.
>> Stephen: I FIND SOMETIMES MY GUT MOUTH SOUNDS BETTER THAN MY FACE MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT?
(LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: THERE IS.
THERE'S THE GUT WHERE YOU'RE...
>> YES?
>> Stephen: IT'S OUT THERE AND THEN THERE'S THE FACE VOICE
WHERE YOU'RE MAKING NOISES BUT YOUR GUTS AREN'T BEHIND IT.
ARE YOU GUT MOUTH OR FACE MOUTH?
>> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A BALANCE BETWEEN BOTH TO BE HONEST.
>> Stephen: CAN WE TALK ABOUT YOUR COG I DON'T GOFY FOR A MINUTE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU CHOREOGRAPH DANCERS.
YOU OFTEN HAVE DANCERS ON STAGE WITH YOU.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: VERY UNUSUAL CHOREOGRAPHY, YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERYWHERE.
A LOT OF JERKY MOVEMENTS,
SOMETIMES.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: WERE THEY RAISED BY WOLFES?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, UM... NO.
(LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT.
IT'S VERY... IT CAN BE VERY LIKE... SOMETIMES VERY AGGRESSIVE AND, HEKY JERKY.
IT COUCHS YOU OFF GUARD.
>> AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO.
I FEEL LIKE THE MOVE GIVES PHYSICAL LIFE TO THE SONG.
THE SONGS HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE AGGRESSIVE....
>> Stephen: THEY DO.
THEY SCARE ME.
(LAUGHTER) SANTIGOLD, ARE YOU READY TO MAYBE LAND THIS THING AND DO
MUSIC ON THE "INTREPID".
>> READY TO ROCK.
>> Stephen: LET'S ROCK THE BOAT.
>> Stephen: SANTIGOLD, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A SONG BY SANTIGOLD.
