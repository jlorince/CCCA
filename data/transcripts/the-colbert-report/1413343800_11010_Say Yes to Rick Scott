NATION, I'M SO EXCITED, THEMID-TERMS ARE ALMOST HERE.
IT'S JUST LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNINGWITH MORE TALK ABOUT JESUS.
WITH 21 DAYS LEFT BEFORE THEELECTION, THERE'S ONE VOTING
GROUP THE G.O.P. IS TRYING TOSTILL WOO, AND THAT'S WOO-MEN!
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS INWORSE SHAPE WITH WOMEN THAN IN
2010.
>> REPUBLICANS AND WOMEN, IT'SBEEN A MESSAGE PROBLEM.
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS APROBLEM COMMUNICATING WITH
WOMEN.
>> STUDY ORDERED BY TWOREPUBLICAN GROUPS FOUND FEMALE
VOTERS FEEL THE PARTY IS STUCKIN THE PAST, SAID THE G.O.P. IS
INTOLERANT AND LACKS COMPASSION.
>> Stephen: OK THE G.O.P. HASPROBLEMS COMMUNICATING WITH
WOMEN BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEYDON'T CARE.
THEY'RE JUST LIKE THAT SHY KIDAT THE DANCE WHO WANTS TO GET
YOUR ATTENTION BY DENYING YOUEQUAL PAY.
IT MEANS HE LIKES YOU.
(LAUGHTER)FORTUNATELY, ONE G.O.P. GROUP
DEVELOPED A CAMPAIGN THAT'S SURETO WIN THE LADY VOTE, THE
COLLEGE REPUBLICAN NATIONALCOMMITTEE OR CRNC!
THEY CREATED AN AD FOR THEHEATED FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE
BETWEEN DEMOCRAT CHALLEGER ANDPARBOILED AMERICAN CHARLIE CRIST
AND REPUBLICAN AND NAKED MOLERAT RICK SCOTT. THE AD ASKS
WOMEN TO MAKE NOVEMBER 4 THEMOST MAGICAL DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
>> THE BUDGET IS A BIG DEAL FORME NOW THAT I JUST
GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE.
>> THE RICK SCOTT IS PERFECT!
RICK SCOTT HAS BECOME THETRUSTED BRAND.
HE HAS NEW IDEAS THAT DON'TBREAK THE BUDGET.
>> THEY ARE IMITATING THEPOPULAR TLC SHOW "SAY YES TO THE
DRESS" TO APPEAL TO THE FEMALEVOTERS IN THE SAME WAY YOU
WOULD APPEAL TO VETERANS WITHCUPCAKE WARS.
IN THIS AD, EACH CANDIDATE ISMETAPHORICALLY REPRESENTED BY A
DIFFERENT WEDDING DRESS AND THEBRIDE LOOKS RADIANT IN THE RICK
SCOTT BUT MOM HAS OTHER IDEAS.
>> I LIKE THE CHARLIE CRIST.
IT'S EXPENSIVE AND A LITTLEOUTDATED, BUT I KNOW BEST.
>> DON'T FORGET, THE CHARLIECRIST COMES WITH ADDITIONAL
COST.
THERE'S OVER $2 BILLION INTAXES.
>> MOM, THIS IS MY DECISION.
I SEE A BETTER FUTURE WITH RICKSCOTT.
>> SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO LET GOOF OLD STYLE BUT IT ALL WORKS
OUT IN THE END BECAUSE SHE SAIDYES TO RICK SCOTT!
(CHEERING)>> Stephen: THIS AD IS
I KNOW, IT'S TOUCHING, ISN'T IT?
AWWW!
PASSED WITH WITH ALL KIND OFCLASSIC CONSERVATIVE MARRIAGE.
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, FISCALCONSERVATISM AND HATING MOM.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXTG.O.P. ADS TELLING BASEBALL AND
APPLE PIE TO GO (BLEEP)THEMSELVES.
THIS AD --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS AD -- THIS AD SHOWS THATTHE MODERN G.O.P. FINALLY
UNDERSTANDS THE REAL CONCERNS OFWOMEN -- WEDDINGS!
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS ACCESS TOCONTRACEPTION OR EQUAL PAY.
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.
LET HIM TAKE CARE OF THAT HARDSTUFF.
OF COURSE, THERE ARE A LOT OFRACES THIS IS YEAR SO THEY HAVE
CUSTOM FITNESS ADD FOR BLUSHINGVOTERS NATIONWIDE.
>> TOM CORBETT IS PERFECT.
THE RICK SNYDER IS PERFECT.
THE ASA HUTCHINSON IS PERFECT.THE BRUCE RAUNER IS PERFECT.
>> Stephen: IT'S A NICE DRESSBUT TRYING OUT THAT MANY
CANDIDATES DISQUALIFIES HER FROMWEARING WHITE (CHEERS)
>> Stephen: I'M SO INSPIREDBY THIS APPEAL TO THE LADIES
THAT I'VE CREATED MY OWN AD IBELIEVE ADDRESSES THE REAL
CONCERNS OF YOUNG, SINGLE WOMEN.JIM?
♪♪>> WOW!
YOU ARE LOOKING CONFIDENT ANDSELF-ASSURED.
>> I AM.
EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW IT'S "THATTIME."
>> MID TERM?
YEAH.
ME, TOO!
I DON'T HAVE YOUR CONFIDENCE.
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
>> WELL, I'M BEING PROTECTEDBY RICK SCOTT IN MY PRIVATE
SECTOR.
>> THAT EXPLAINS IT.
I'M STILL USING...
CHARLIE CRIST.
>> IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS SINCE HEWAS GOVERNOR.
HE COULD NEVER GIVE YOU THATFRESH FEELING.
JUST LOOK AT THIS SIDE BY SIDECOMPARISON.
UNDER CHARLIE CRIST, TAXPAYERDOLLARS WILL BE LEAKING
EVERYWHERE.
BUT RICK SCOTT KEEPS YOUR TAXDOLLARS WHERE THEY BELONG, EVEN
ON HEAVY SPENDING DAYS.
>> BUT WHERE DOES SCOTT STAND ONEMPLOYERS PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR
CONTRACEPTIVES?>> LET'S JUST RIDE OUR BIKES.
>> RICK SCOTT, THE BESTCANDIDATE.
>> PERIOD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: AND, LADIES...
