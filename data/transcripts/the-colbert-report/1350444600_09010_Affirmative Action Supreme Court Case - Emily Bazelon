OF THE STUDENTS DOES NOT MATTER
ANYMORE BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE
ASIAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, THAT IS THE FINAL WORD ON
THIS SUBJECT.
HERE TO SAY MORE FINAL WORDS ON
IT, PLEASE WELCOME LEGAL EXPERT
AND SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT
YALE LAW SCHOOL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY.
GOOD MANY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, OKAY?
HOLD ON.
ARE YOU WHITE?
OKAY.
I HAVE TO ASK.
I DON'T SEE RACE.
NOT EVEN MY OWN.
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU.
>> STEPHEN: PEOPLE TELL ME I'M
WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE
I LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE I TALK
ABOUT RACE.
OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
HOW DOES THE LAW STAND RIGHT NOW
IN THIS CASE?
IF THE OBAMA GIRLS WERE AMYING
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS WOULD
THEY GET PREFERENTIAL PLACEMENT
BECAUSE OF RACE?
>> THE THING ABOUT THEM IS YOU
COULD IMAGINE THEM HAVING AN
ADVANTAGE IN ADMISSION BECAUSE
THEY ARE CELEBRITY KIDS.
>> STEPHEN: JUST IMAGINE JUST
THEIR FATHER HAD NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN KIDS GET
PLACEMENT UNDER THESE RULES?
>> NOT NECESSARILY.
IT'S ONE OF PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES
THE SCHOOL CAN TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT.
THEY DON'T HAVE TO FAVOR AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WEALTHY PUBLIC
CAN'T.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THIS GIRL
COMPLAINING ABOUT?
>> SHE SAID IT HAPPENED TO HER
BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE RACE IS IN
THE MIX FOR SOME OF THE KIDS WHO
GOT IN AND SHE DID NOT.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ARE THE
FACTORS LEGACY, IF YOUR DAD GAVE
A LIBRARY.
>> COMMUNITY SERVICE,
LEADERSHIP, SOCIOECONOMIC
BACKGROUND.
YOU HAVE TO WRITE HE ISES IS A.
THERE'S A LONG LIST OF THINGS.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DO YOU THINK
IT'S GOING TO GO?
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO
GO WELL FOR UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BECAUSE
JUSTICE KENNEDY SEEMED
SKEPTICAL.
AND HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT
PRIVILEGED AFRICAN-AMERICANS
GETTING A LEGUP OVER POORER
WHITE STUDENTS.
>> STEPHEN: THERE ARE ONLY
EIGHT JUSTICES BECAUSE KAGAN
RECUSED HERSELF.
WHY?
>> PRESUMABLY SHE WORKED ON THE
CASE BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL US WHY.
>> STEPHEN: SHOULDN'T
SOTOMAYOR TAKE THEMSELVES OUT OF
IT BECAUSE THEY ARE MINORITIES?
JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD A ROUGH
TIME, TOO.
THE IRISH 100 YEARS AGO NEED NOT
APPLY ALONG WITH ITALIANS.
SHOULDN'T IT JUST BE ROBERTS
DECIDING THIS CASE?
>> DOESN'T HE HAVE THE MOST SKIN
IN THE GAME BECAUSE IF YOU GET
RID OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THAT
BENEFITS MORE WHITE PEOPLE.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH BUT THAT'S
HOW IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
DOESN'T THAT SEEM THE MOST
AMERICAN?
>> HISTORICALLY YOU ARE PROBABLY
RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: WHITE MAN IS
NEUTRAL.
UNCLE SAM DEFAULT AMERICANS.
>> THIS ISN'T TRUE.
>> STEPHEN: HIS YOU ON THE
ROPES.
I ALMOST MADE YOU A JEWISH WOMAN
ADMIT I MORE AMERICAN THAN YOU
ARE.
>> WE LIVE IN A MELTING POT
IMMIGRANT FILLED SOCIETY WITH
ALL RACES AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.
>> STEPHEN: IF AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION IS OVER TURNED WHAT IS
GOING TO THE BE THE GREATEST
EFFECT OF THAT?
>> WE WOULD HOPE THAT SCHOOLS
WOULD START TAKING MORE
SOCIOECONOMICS INTO ACCOUNT AND
USING THATS AWAY TOY CONTINUE TO
HAVE POOR STUDENTS COME INTO
SCHOOL.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S ABOUT
CLASS.
>> THAT IS CLASS BUT THERE WILL
BE FEWER AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND
HISPANIC STUDENTS ADMITTED.
>> STEPHEN: SO WE COULD BE IN
A CLASS WAR.
>> I HOPE NOT.
>> STEPHEN: WE'VE BEEN IN A
RACE WAR.
>> YOU ARE INVITING A CLASS WAR?
>> STEPHEN: I'M NOT INVITING
IT.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAR I'LL BE
INTO.
I WOULD BE TBHRT A RACE WAR THAN
A CLASS WAR BECAUSE I'M IN THE
TOP 1% AND THAT'S A MINORITY.
BUT IN A RACE WAR I'M IN THE
MAJORITY.
>> THAT'S STILL TRUE BUT NOT FOR
THAT LONG.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> STEPHEN: CAN WE HAVE A
SUPREME COURT CASE ABOUT THAT?
>> ABOUT HAVING MORE WHITE
PEOPLE HAVE A HIGHER BIRTH RATE?
I DON'T THINK SOX WE'LL CONTINUE
TO BE MORE AND MORE DIVERSE.
IT'S A GOOD THING.
>> STEPHEN: I BELIEVE THAT ALL
PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED
OR COLOR HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE
SADDLED WITH CRUSHING STUDENT
DEBT FOR THE REST OF THEIR
LIVES.
PLEASE COME BACK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANKS, EMILY.
