>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
THANK YOU LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU
KNOW, FOLKS, I WAS TEMPTED
TO FIGHT AGAINST YOUR LOVE
OF ME BUT I KNOW I WOULD
LOSE.
NOW FOLKS I KNOW YOU HAVE A
LOT OF CHOICES IN LATE NIGHT
AND WE HEAR AT THE REPORT
VALUE YOUR BUSINESS.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, MI SAD TO SAY THAT
TONIGHT MY MAN HERMAN CAIN
IS STILL DEEP IN CAMPAIGN
RECONSIDERATION MODE.
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T GET WHY HE WOULD
CONSIDER DROPPING OUT NOW.
HE HASN'T HAD A SCANDAL IN
ALMOST 36 HOURS.
HE'S ON A ROLL.
AS YOU KNOW FIRST A STRING
OF WOMEN ACCUSED HIM OF
SEXUAL HARASSED.
AND THIS WEEK ATLANTA
BUSINESSWOMAN GINGER WHITE
CLAIMS SHE AND CAIN HAD A 13
YEAR AFFAIR.
BUT I BELIEVE HERMAN CAIN
WHEN HE SAYS GINGER WHITE
WAS JUST A FRIEND AND HE WAS
OFFERING HER FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE.
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY SHE HAS
PHONE RECORDS SHOWING 61
CALLS OR TEXTS BETWEEN THEM
INCLUDING ONE AT 4:26 IN THE
MORNING.
HE WAS PROBABLY ADVISING HER
ON HER STOCK PORTFOLIO AT
4:00 IN THE MORNING AND HE
JUST WANTED TO GIVE HER A
HOT TIP.
(LAUGHTER)
THE HOT TIP-- ITS HOT TIP,
OF COURSE, IS THE MOST
SENSITIVE PART OF THE
PORTFOLIO.
WELL, THANKFULLY, FOLKS, I
DO NOT NEED TO DEFEND CAIN
ANY MORE BECAUSE THERE IS
DEFINITIVE PROOF OF HIS
INNOCENCE.
AND IF SOME ARIZONA STATE
SENATOR AND TALBOTS CASHIER
LORI KLEIN.
KLEIN WHO HAS KNOWN KANE FOR
12 YEARS AND IS CURRENTLY
HIS ARIZONA STATE CHAIRMAN
DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT CAIN
WOULD SEXUALLY HARASS ANYONE
BY POINTING OUT THAT CAIN
HAS, QUOTE, NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING BUT A GENTLEMAN AND
I AM NOT AN UNATTRACTIVE
WOMAN.
EXACTLY.
COME ON.
THERE IS NO WAY, NO WAY
HERMAN CAIN COULD BE A
SERIAL MASHER IF HE IS
SPENDING TIME AROUND LORI
AND NOT TRYING TO DRY HUMP
HER IN AN ELEVATOR.
THAT WOMAN IS THE DEFINITION
OF NOT UNATTRACTIVE.
SO THIS PROVES ONCE AND FOR
ALL CAIN IS NOT A SIR
CROTCHFORD STROKE-AND-GROUP.
IN FACT P IF KANE IS NOT
TRYING TO BAG AND TAG STATE
SENATOR KLEIN, I THINK THE
REAL SCANDAL IS THAT HERMAN
CAIN IS PROBABLY-- PROBABLY
GAY.
(LAUGHTER)
I MINE THAT WOULD FINALLY
EXPLAIN WHY CAIN TWICE
CANCELED HIS APPEARANCES ON
MY SHOW.
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THERE
IS NO WAY HE COULD HANDLE
HIMSELF AROUND ALL THIS
GOODNESS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: RIGHT?
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG, FOLKS,
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG BUT
MINOT UNHANDSOME.
I CAN BARELY CONCENTRATE
WHEN I SHAVE IN THE MORNING.
I MEAN GUN
