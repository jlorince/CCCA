PLEASE, PLEASE, FOLKS, HAVE A SEAT.
FOLKS, BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
A NORMALLY DON'T WASTE MY TIME REPORTING ON TINSELTOWN BUT TODAY THERE'S SHOCK NEWS
OUT OF HOLLYWOOD ABOUT ONE OF MY HEROES, FRED WILLARD.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW HIM FROM FILMS LIKE THIS IS SPINAL TAP, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN AND BEST IN SHOW,
FUNNY, FUNNY GUY.
WELL, FRED JUST GOT ARRESTED AT THE TIKI THEATRE, AN X-RATED MOVIE HOUSE IN LOS
ANGELES WITH HIS PANTS DOWN AND I'M HOPING LIKE A TEA TOWEL ON THE SEAT.
NOW I GOT TWO THINGS TO SAY HERE.
FIRST TO THE L.A. COPS, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS STAND BY OUR BOYS IN BLUE, BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
(LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT DOW EXPECT TO FIND IN THE TIKI THEATRE, ROGER ARE-- ROGER EBERT REVIEWING TOLL BOOTH SHUT 4?
NO.
IT'S GENTLEMAN WHO STILL APPRECIATE SEEING MOVIES ON THE BIG SILVER GIVING EACH
ONE THEIR OWN PRIVATE THUMBS UP.
SO EITHER CLOSE THE PLACE DOWN OR LEAVE THEM ALONE.
SECONDLY, MR. WILLARD, RIGHT OFF THE BAT, STILL A HUGE FAN.
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.
IT'S CALLED THE INTERNET.
OKAY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S COMPLICATED.
ASK YOUR GRANDCHILDREN.
BUT DON'T TELL THEM
