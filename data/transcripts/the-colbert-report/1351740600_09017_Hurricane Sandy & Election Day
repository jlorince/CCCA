THEY'RE GREAT WITH KIDS WHO DON'T MAKE SUDDEN MOVES.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, WITH ALL THIS HEART BREAKING DEVASTATION, THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE QUESTION ON
EVERYONE'S MIND.
>> HOW WILL THIS AFFECT ELECTION DAY?
>> WITH MUCH OF THE EAST COAST BATTERED BY SANDY ONLY SEVEN DAYS FROM THE ELECTION, HOW WILL IT IMPACT THE RACE?
>> IT'S MOTHER NATURE'S OCTOBER SURPRISE.
A STORM SO BIG AND SO DESTRUCTIVE IT COULD THROW THE CAMPAIGN'S FINAL WEEK INTO CHAOS.
>> Stephen: YES, ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE FRANTICALLY TEXTING THEIR LOVED ONES.
"YOUR FATHER AND I ARE OR WORRIED, HAVE YOU SEEN THE LATEST TRACKING POLLS OF UNDECIDED SUBURBAN WOMEN IN
OHIO?" (LAUGHTER) AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS, THIS HURRICANE HAS GOT "ELECTION" ALL OVER IT!
OUT OF SENSITIVITY, LESS THAN ONE WEEK FROM ELECTION DAY MITT ROMNEY HAS BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND HIS CAMPAIGN!
THAT'S WHY HE SCRAPPED HIS VICTORY RALLY IN KETTERING, OHIO AND INSTEAD APPEARED AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THE SAME
SPOT -- (LAUGHTER) -- WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AND CALLED IT A STORM RELIEF RALLY.
WHICH IS SO COMFORTING FOR ALL THOSE LIVING ON OHIO'S HARD-HIT ATLANTIC COAST.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NOW, AT THE STORM RELIEF NOT-CAMPAIGN EVENT, MITT AIRED A BIOGRAPHICAL VIDEO THAT WAS PART
OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AND THE PRESS BADGES CALLED IT A VICTORY RALLY.
BUT HE WAS CLEARLY THERE FOR THE CANNED GOODS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO BOX THESE THINGS UP IN JUST A MINUTE AND PUT THEM ON SOME TRUCKS AND WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM INTO UH
UH -- I THINK IT'S NEW JERSEY.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: BOY, THAT REALLY WARMS MY UH -- UH -- I THINK IT'S MY HEART?
(APPLAUSE) AND, FOLKS, IT'S NOT -- ONE OF THOSE ORGANS.
JUST ONE OF THEM.
FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST THE HURRICANE THAT'S HURTING ROMNEY HERE.
HE HAS TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER THREAT THAT CAN BE SEEN FROM SPACE, CHRIS CHRISTIE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, AS I SAID EARLIER -- AS I SAID EARLIER, HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB, BUT HE'S SO INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE
NEEDS OF HIS CONSTITUENTS THAT I THINK HE'S LOST SIGHT OF WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT!
>> IF YOU THINK RIGHT NOW I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS THAN YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT THREE TIMES YESTERDAY.
HE CALLED ME FOR THE LAST TIME AT MIDNIGHT ASKING WHAT HE CAN DO.
HE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL TO OUR STATE AND NOT ONCE DID HE BRING UP THE ELECTION.
I SAID IF YOU COULD EXPEDITE THE MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION WITHOUT THE NORMAL FEMA MUM BOW JUDGE BOY, HE GOT RIGHT ON IT
AND THIS MORNING I UNDERSTAND HE HE SIGNED A DISASTER DECLARATION FOR NEW JERSEY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ALL OVER THIS AND HE DESERVES GREAT CREDIT.
>> Stephen: OH, COME ON!
YOU'RE PRAISING OBAMA JUST BECAUSE HE DECLARED NEW JERSEY A DISASTER AREA?
JOHNNY CARSON DID THAT FOR 30 YEARS!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) HAY-OH!
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.
STAY DRY UP THERE.
FOLKS, IT'S ONE WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION AND CHRISTIE IS PRAISING A DEMOCRAT.
WHAT'S NEXT?
A DEMOCRAT PRAISING CHRISTIE?
IT'S UNNATURAL!
IT'S LIKE KISSING YOUR SISTER!
WHICH, BY THE WAY, WILL BE FEDERAL LAW IF OBAMA IS REELECTED.
(LAUGHTER) THEN TODAY CHRISTIE AND OBAMA WENT ON A TOUR OF HURRICANE DAMAGE.
BARACK
