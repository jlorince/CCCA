EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY
MY DESK IS COVERED WITH FABRIC
AND RICK RACK.
MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW
BOOK ALL ABOUT WRAPPING.
PLEASE WELCOME THE PRETTY LITTLE
CHRISTMAS BUY KNOW AMY SEDARIS.
WOOO!
WOOOO!
HI, AMY.
HEY.
HI.
OKAY, AMY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC?
>> I'VE BEEN ON MY KNEES.
>> Stephen: WELL, AMY, LET'S
GET RIGHT TO THE HEAT OF THE
MEAT HERE.
YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED
"SIMPLE TIMES: CRAFTS FOR POOR
PEOPLE."
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT IS REALLY
BOLD.
POOR PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD BOOKS.
>> WELL, THEY'RE RICH IDEAS FOR
THE POOR, BUT POOR PEOPLE STEAL
THINGS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO STEAL THE BOOK.
>> YES, OR GO TO THE LIBRARY.
>> Stephen: I LOVE SOME OF THE
IDEAS I SEE IN THIS BOOK.
>> REALLY?
>>
>> Stephen: ONE OF THEM I LOVE
IS YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE CHAPTER ON
UNRETURNABLE CHRISTMAS GIFTS.
>> YES, IT'S HARD TO RETURN A
GIFT THAT SOMEBODY MADE FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE NO STORE
WOULD TAKE IT.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: AND IF YOU GIVE IT
BACK TO THEM, THEY KNOW YOU
DIDN'T LIKE IT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
THINGS WE CAN DO HERE.
I SEE YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE TIES
OVER HERE.
>> THIS IS SOMETHING NEW.
IT'S CALLED A TIE SNAKE.
AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET HOLD
OF A TIE.
>> Stephen: LIKE THIS ONE.
THIS IS AN UGLY TIE.
>> OH, MERRY CHRISTMAS, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
WHAT DO I DO?
>> YOU GO AROUND TO ALL THE
LAUNDROMATS AND COLLECT DRIER
LENT.
THIS IS ALSO GOOD FOR BIRDS IF
THEY WANT THE MAKE A NEST.
DON'T YOU REGRET PICKING THAT
UP?
>> Stephen: WHAT DO I DO WITH
IT, AIM?
>> YOU STUFF THE NECKTIE, AND
LIKE A TURKEY YOU CAN DO IT BACK
HERE, TOO.
YOU CAN ALSO USE KITTY LITTER.
>> Stephen: YOU STUFF IT RIGHT
IN HERE LIKE A DRUM STICK.
I BELIEVE THIS WAS ORIGINALLY
USED BY RUSH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TUCK THAT IN THERE.
>> YOU CAN ALSO USE HAIR, IF YOU
SAVE HAIR FROM YOUR HAIRBRUSH.
>> Stephen: OR YOU SHAVE YOUR
DOG, YOU COULD PUT THAT IN
THERE.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A
COMPLETED ONE IN THERE.
>> I HAVE A COMPLETED ONE.
HIS NAME IS TYSON.
>> OH, THAT IS GREAT.
VERY USEFUL.
YOU COULD...
>> WHAT I DO IS I PUT IT
UNDERNEATH A DOOR SO THE DRAFT
DOESN'T COME THROUGH.
>> STEPHEN: I'VE GOT SOME CRAFTS
OF MY OWN, CAN I SHARE THEM WITH
YOU?
>> THIS IS A GREAT GIFT FOR
KIDS.
YOU TAKE BANANA.
>> WHAT WE DO.
>> Stephen: THEN YOU JUST PUT
A COUPLE OF DROPS OF GLUE.
>> ANY KIND OF GLUE?
>> Stephen: ELMER'S GLUE IS
BEST.
CRAZY GHIEW IS DANGEROUS.
>> OKAY, OKAY.
>> Stephen: TAKE A COUPLE
GOOGLY EYES.
PUT IT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE
BANANA.
>> DO THEY HAVE TO BE THE SAME
SIDE?
>> IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SAME
SIDE, IT LOOK LIKE A FLOUNDER.
IF YOU PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT
SIDES YOU HAVE WHAT I LIKE THE
CALL A DOLPHIN BANANA.
>> CLEVER.
VERY NICE.
>> THEN WHEN YOU EAT IT, YOU CAN
PRETEND YOU'RE PEELING A DOLPHIN
ALIVE.
>> WHICH WE ALL WANT TO DO.
VERY NICE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
>> I HAVE, WELL, IT'S A BUSY
TIME OF YEAR.
YOU'RE TRYING THE SAVE MONEY.
>> Stephen: AND YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING FOR YOUR FRIENDS
AROUND THE OFFICE?
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS GOING
TO SAY THAT?
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SAVE ALL THE
CRUMBS FROM YOUR COOKIES OR
CAKE, PUT THEM IN THE BAG, KEEP
THEM IN YOUR FEVER FOR A YEAR.
THEN WHEN IT'S TIME FOR THE
OFFICE PARTY, PUT THEM ON A
PLATE WITH A NOTE THAT SAYS
PLEASE ENJOY MY HOMEMADE COOKIE,
AND THEN YOU JUST SEE, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE COME UP AND THEY'LL
ASSUME, OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE ALL
GONE.
OR YOU'D LIKE TO SAY, HEY,
COLBERT, DID YOU ENJOY MY
HOME-BAKED COOKIES?
YOU'LL SAY, AMY, THAT RED THE
BEST COOKIES YOU EVER MADE.
AND I'LL KNOW YOU'RE LYING, BIG
LIAR, OFF MY LIST.
>> WOW.
A PENNY PINSCHER AND YOU GET TO
JUDGE PEOPLE'S CHARACTER.
EXACTLY.
I GOT ONE MORE FOR YOU.
I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE A LOT OF
JIEWCH FRIENDS, AND I DON'T CARE
WHO KNOWS THAT.
AND THEY GIVE ME... THEY HAVE
HOLIDAY, TOO, WHICH I DID NOT
KNOW.
>> THEY DO.
>> Stephen: THEY HAVE A
HOLIDAY CALLED HANUKKAH AND THEY
GIVE OUT DREIDELS.
AND THEY'RE FUN AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.
I LIKE THE TURN THEM INTO REAL
HOLIDAY TREASURES BY... I TURN
THEM UPSIDE DOWN.
THEY MEAN SOMETHING TO SWRIEWSH
PEOPLE.
THEY JUST DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO
ME.
THEN YOU PUT THEM UPSIDE DOWN
LIKE THIS IN THAT LITTLE
CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE STAND LIKE
THAT.
>> OH, THAT'S NICE.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A COMPLETED
ONE.
YOU CAN PAINT IT UP AND PUT A
STAR ON TOP AND THERE IS...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL, IS THAT
NOT?
>> THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
WOW.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD PUT THAT
IN YOUR NEXT BOOK.
>> I WILL.
IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE COVER.
>> Stephen: AIM YEAR, I
UNDERSTAND THERE IS A CHARITY
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY VERY CLOSE TO
YOUR HEART, AND FOR THE
CHRISTMAS SEASON YOU WOULD LIKE
TO DO A GOOD DEED FOR SOME
CREATURES OUT THERE WHO NEED
YOUR HELP.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
CAN I BORROW YOUR MONITOR?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
PUT THIS DOWN THE PIPE.
>> HELLO, I'M AMY SEDARIS.
THIS WEEKEND AT THE METROPOLITAN
PAVILION IN YC, THERE WILL BE A
PET MARATHON WHERE HUNDREDS OF
CATS AND KITTENS WILL BE
AVAILABLE FOR ONE PERSON ONLY.
