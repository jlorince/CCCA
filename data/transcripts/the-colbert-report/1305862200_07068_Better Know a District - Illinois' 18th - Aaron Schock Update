GO GET EM, BUDDY.
FOLK, SWIMSUIT SEASON IS
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND
THERE'S ONE PLACE I ALWAYS
TURN FOR MY FITNESS TIPS,
THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST CHECK OUT THIS MONTH'S
ISSUE OF THE VERY NOT GAY
MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE.
THAT'S ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN
AARON SCHOCH SHOWING OFF HIS
SIX-PACK ABS.
AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU
CAN ALSO SEE HIS PATHWAY TO
PROSPERITY.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW CONGRESSMAN
SCHOCH IS PARTNERING WITH
MEN'S HEALTH TO PROMOTE A
FITNESS INITIATIVE CALLED
THE FIT FOR LIFE SUMMER
CHALLENGE ENCOURAGING ALL
AMERICANS TO GET FIT FOR
LIFE UNTIL SEPTEMBER.
THEN WE TURN BACK INTO-- THEN
WE TURN BACK INTO ALFREDO-BASED
LIFE FORMS.
I APPLAUD CONGRESSMAN SCHOCH
FOR USING THE POWER OF HIS
OFFICE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF
JUST HOW RIPPED HE IS.
OF COURSE THIS ISN'T THE
FIRST TIME I LAID EYES ON
AARON SCHOCH.
I SPOKE WITH THE FULLY
CLOTHED CONGRESSMAN BACK IN
2009.
JIM?
>> HI, STEPHEN COLBERT.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> HI, MR. COLBERT, WELCOME.
>> Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT
THE FIGHTING 18th.
>> TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT?
>> Stephen: THE FIGHTING
18th.
>> THE FIGHTING 18th1234
WHAT'S THE FIGHTING 18th.
>> Stephen: DO YOU NOT
REPRESENT THE 18th DISTRICT
OF ILLINOIS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT
THE FIGHTING 18th.
>> YOU MEAN LIKE TELL YOU
ABOUT MY DISTRICT.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS BETTER TO
SAY FIGHTING 18th.
>> IT'S A 20 COUNTY DISTRICT,
HOME TO 161 TOWNS.
>> Stephen: FAIR WARNING,
I'M ALREADY BORED.
>> WELL, I THINK A LOT OF
REMARKABLE THINGS HAPPEN IN
PER ORIA JUST AS A LOT OF
REMARKABLE THINGS HAPPEN
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE
YOUNGEST MEMBER OF CONGRESS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A
HAZING PROCESS?
>> NO, NOT REALLY, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO SPANKING MACHINE,.
>> NO SPANKING MACHINE IN
CONGRESS.
>> Stephen: NO NICK NAMES.
>> NO NICK NAMES.
>> Stephen: SCHOCHMAN,
SCHOCH MEISTER, ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: SCHOCH JOCK, THE
SCHOCHER!
YOU SHOULD GET ONE, STAND
OUT FROM THE CROWD.
>> I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR
THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN
CALLED THE BRODY GENERAL OF
CONGRESS.
>> BY TMZ.
>> Stephen: I HAVE ALSO
LEARNED FROM TMZ THAT YOU
HAVE SIX PACK ABS, IS THERE
ANY TRUTH TO THAT.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: IT IS A SIMP EL
QUESTION.
DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT.
>> AS SOON AS I SAY THAT AND
THEN I GET OUT OF SHAPE
YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT
AGAINST ME SO YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE IMPLYING
THAT I AM SO TAKEN WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW, THAT I AM-- AM UP
SET, YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT I
WILL STAY OBSESSED WITH YOUR
ABS.
AND YES, I'M NOT SAYING
THERE IS NO CHEMISTRY HERE.
BUT I'M SAYING I'M KEEPING
IT PROFESSIONAL.
I WISH YOU WOULD DO THE SAME,
RIGHT.
>> GOTCHA.
>> Stephen: DOW BELIEVE
BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE
UNITED STATES.
>> ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES
OF BEING IN PUBLIC SERVICE
AND ACTUALLY BEING IN PUBLIC
REL SOME THAT PEOPLE SAY A
LOT OF THINGS ABOUT YOU.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE HAVE SAID
SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU.
>> I KNOW THEY'VE SAID A LOT
OF THINGS ABOUT YOU.
>> Stephen: THE ONE THING
THEY SAY ABOUT YOU THAT I'M
HESITANT TO BRING UP AND I
WONDER IF YOU WANT TO
RESPOND.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND THE QUESTION?
>> Stephen: IS IT TRUE OR
NOT IS WHAT I AM ASKING.
>> IS WHAT?
>> Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO
SPREAD RUMORS.
>> SO LET'S JUST PUT IT TO
BED, SAY IT'S NOT TRUE.
>> WHAT'S THAT.
>> Stephen: IF I SAY IT,
THEN I'M SPREADING IT.
>> I SEE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S NOT
TRUE.
>> IT'S NOT TRUE, THANK YOU.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> SWITCHING GEARS, YOU ARE
PRO-LIFE AND PRO GUN.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHERE DO YOU
FIND THE COURAGE TO SWIM
AGAINST THE TIDE LIKE THAT.
>> WELL, THE CONSTITUTION
PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS
IN LIFE.
BEING PRO-LIFE MEANS I
BELIEVE IN THE SANCTITY OF
HUMAN LIFE AND PROTECTING
THE UNBORN AND I THINK
THAT'S STILL IN CONCERT WITH
THE SECOND AMENDMENT OF THE
CONSTITUTION WHICH IS THE
RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.
>> WHAT ABOUT FETUSES WITH
GUNS.
IF I CAN JUST INTERRUPT
YOUR -- FOR A MOMENT.
ARE FETUSES LIVING HUMANS?
>> I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT
RELATES TO-- .
>> Stephen: ARE THEY BY
DEFINITION ALIVE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SHOULD THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
SO FEW POLITICIANS ARE
WILLING TO SAY THAT.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen: DOW HAVE SIX
PACK ABS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: CONGRESSMAN,
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO TALK WITH US.
>> ANY TIME.
