>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, CAN YOU
SMELL-LA-LA-LA COLBERT IS COOK?
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BECAUSE
TVs DON'T TRANSMITT SMELL.
IF YOU SAID YES, EITHER YOUR
HOUSE IS ON FIRE OR YOU'RE
HAVING A STROKE.
THIS IS ALL FOR FOOD.
TONIGHT'S THOUGHT FOR FOOD IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY TRISCUITS,
ROSE MARY AND OLIVE OIL, NOW
WITH NATURAL FLAVOR WITH OTHER
NATURAL FLAVOR.
( LAUGHTER )
ENJOY IT AS A SNACK OR AS AN
OTHER SNACK.
FOLKS, AMERICA HAS ALWAYS LED
THE WAY IN FOOD DELIVERY
INNOVATION, AND WE ARE BREAKING
NEW GROUND AGAIN.
>> NOW THERE'S A FUN AND
EXCITING WAY TO CREATE YOUR
FAVORITE SWEETS.
IT'S A CAKE.
IT'S A POP.
IT'S PUSHY POPS.
WATCH, JUST LODE THEM UP, PUSH
THEM UP, NEN THEN EAT THEM UP.
LAYER THEM IN FRESH BAKED CAKES
OR MAKE AN EASY TREAT WITH YOUR
FAVORITES FROM THE STORE.
THAT'S RIGHT, NO BAKING
REQUIRED.
TRY MINIMUFFINS, CUP CAKES,
BROWNIEES, EVEN COOKIES.
FILL THEM WITH YOUR FAVORITE
TOPPING, ADD CREAMY FROSTING AND
DON'T FORGET THE SPRINKLES.
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDINGLY.
>> Stephen:  YES, PUSHY POPS!
AND THEY CALL IT PUSHY BECAUSE
IT FORCES FOOD DOWN YOUR THROAT.
( LAUGHTER )
AND MUCH MORE GENTLY THAN THE
HUNGERHAMMER.
( LAUGHTER )
PUSHY POP FOOTBALLLY ADDRESSES
THE MOST ANNOYING PART OF
EATING, THE PAUSE BETWEEN
PUTTING FOOD IN YOUR FACE AND
PUTTING MORE FOOD IN YOUR FACE
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE )
AT LAST, WE CAN EAT OURSELVES AT
A CONTINUOUS RELIABLE CREM.
AND FOR TOO LONG, FOLKS, OUR
DESSERTS HAVE TAKEN IRREGULAR
SHAPES.
WHY AM I WORKING SO HARD TO PUT
A SQUARE BROWNIE DOWN A ROUND
ESOPHAGUS WHEN PUSHY POPS TURNS
THE FOOD INTO A SMOOTH CYLINDER
MY DIJECTIVE TRACK CAN
UNDERSTAND.
AND YOU CAN PREPACK AN ENTIRE
MEAL.
JUST REMEMBER TO LODE IT IN
REVERSE ORDER.
START WITH DESSERT, MAYBE A
LITTLE CHEESECAKE, THEN YOUR
MEAT, PREFERABLY IN LOAF FORM.
OKAY?
THEN, OF COURSE, SOME STARCH--
MAYBE SOME MASHED POTATOES.
THERE YOU GO.
AND YOU WANT TO TOP IT OFF FOR
YOUR STARTER, SOME SALAD.
ALL RIGHT.
MMM-MMM-MMM.
LOOK AT THAT!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW YOU'VE GOT A HOME COOKED
MEAL ON THE GO JUST LIKE MOM
USED TO PLUNGE.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE TRUE JEANUOUS OF PUSHY
POPS IS THAT THEY'RE REALLY JUST
SELLING YOU EMPTY SPACE THAT YOU
FILL WITH THE FOOD YOU LOVE.
AND IN THAT SPIRIT, I AM
THRILLED TO INTRODUCE MY NEW
PRODUCT, JIM?
>> IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S SET
AND SQUARE.
IT'S A FUN AND EXCITING CLASSIC
SQUARE THAT YOU CAN SET ALL OF
YOUR FAVORITE FOODS ON.
LIKE COOKIES.
CANDY.
EVEN HAMBURGER SANDWICHES.
ACT NOW AND YOU CAN ALSO SET
THINGS ON SETTING SQUARE THAT
AREN'T FOOD.
CAR KEYS, MAIL, SLIM JIMS, EVEN
SMALLER CLASSIC SQUARES.
THAT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S SET AND
SQUARE.
NOW AVAILABLE IN CIRCLES.
>> Stephen:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK
