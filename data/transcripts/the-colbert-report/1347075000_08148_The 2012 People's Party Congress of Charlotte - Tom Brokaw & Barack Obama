AND THE HOUSE IS IN HIM.
NOW, BESIDES THE VMAs, LAST NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER GATHERING OF SHRIEKING FAN GIRLS, THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.
OF COURSE, ALL THE MAJOR MEDIA WERE THERE.
AND AS SUCH, I WANT TO GIVE A QUICK SHOUTOUT TO MY MAN TOM BROKAW, WHO HAD A LITTLE HEALTH SCARE YESTERDAY AND HAD TO BE
RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL.
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.
ITS TO GO OUT HE ACCIDENTALLY TOOK AMBIEN RIGHT BEFORE HIS APPEARANCE ON "MORNING JOE." I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOM THOUGHT HE
WAS TAKING.
SH, WHEN I GO ON SCARBOROUGH, I DO ECSTASY.
( CHEERING )  ( APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT A MORNING PERSON.
I'M REALLY NOT-- I'M NOT A MORNING PERSON.
AND SOMETIMES COFFEE DOESN'T CUT IT.
EVERYBODY WHO IS ANYBODY HAD TO BE THERE IN CHARLOTTE LAST NIGHT FOR NIGHT THREE OF THE OBAMAATHON.
WHEN THE DEAR LEADER CAME OUT TO FINALLY GIVE HIS BIG SPEECH.
I TOOK SOME NOTES AS I WATCHED IT LAST NIGHT, AND MY GENERAL REACTION WAS-- I'M KIND OF PARSING THIS TOGETHER-- THIS IS
THE MOST INSPIRING UNIMPRESSIVE SPEECH I'VE EVER SEEN.
( LAUGHTER ) THE SAME OLD VISION FOR A NEW AMERICA APPEALING TO OUR COLLECTIVE DIGNITY.
WHY AM I SUDDENLY CRYING?
KIDS, WAKE UP.
DADDY WANTS TO HUG YOU, SNOOZE-FEST.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
A FAIR AMOUNT OF IT IS TEAR STAINED.
IT'S HARD TO READ, UNFORTUNATELY.
WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME MOST WAS RIGHT OFF THE BEAN, HE TROTTED OUT THE SAME WILD CLAIMS THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN WORKING
FOR YEARS TO DISPROVE.
>> I'M THE PRESIDENT.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERING ) THAT IS SO ARROGANT!
( LAUGHTER ) I BET YOU ANYTHING YOU NEVER HEAR MITT ROMNEY SAY THOSE WORDS.
(  LAUGHTER  ) FOLKS--  ( CHEERING ) THE REST OF-- MITT ROMNEY.
ALL RIGHT.
ROMNEY FANS.
WE ARE PACKED WITH ROMNEY FANS TONIGHT.
(  LAUGHTER  ) FOLKS, THE REST OF THE SPEECH WAS JUST PROGRESSIVE COLLECTIVIST DOGMA.
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS SAYING THE COUNTRY BELONGS TO ALL OF US.
I MEAN, JUST LISTEN TO THESE LIBERAL PIE-IN-THE-SKY DREAMS.
>> WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A C.E.O.
PAYS HIS AUTO WORKERS ENOUGH TO BUY THE CARS THAT THEY BUILD, THE WHOLE COMPANY DOES BETTER.
>> Stephen:  OH, SURE.
AND EVERY WORKER AT BOEING SHOULD BE PAID ENOUGH TO AFFORD A 747.
( LAUGHTER ) OH, OH, OH,-- AND WHY YOU'RE AT IT WHY NOT PAY EVERY McDONALD'S CASHIER ENOUGH TO BUY A BURGER.
YOU'RE LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THEN, AS IF HIS POLICY FAILURES WERE NOT ENOUGH, FOLKS, HE STARTED BLAMING OTHER PEOPLE FOR THEM.
>> MY FELLOW CITIZENS, YOU WERE THE CHANGE.
YOU'RE THE REASON A YOUNG IMMIGRANT WHO GREW UP HERE AND WENT TO SCHOOL HERE AND PLEDGED ALLEGIANCE TO OUR FLAG WILL NO
LONGER BE DEPORTED FROM THE ONLY COUNTRY SHE'S EVER CALLED HOME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SELFLESS SOLDIERS WON'T BE KICKED OUT OF THE MILITARY BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHO THEY LOVE.
YOU DID THAT!
YOU DID THAT!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  I DID THAT?
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT?
I'M SORRY.
WHEN-- WHEN DID I DO THAT?
( LAUGHTER ) WAS I SLEEP-CHANGING AMERICA AGAIN?
IT'S SO DAMN PILLS BROKAW GAVE ME!
