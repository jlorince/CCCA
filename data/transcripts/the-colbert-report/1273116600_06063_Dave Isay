>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK CELEBRATING AMERICA'S MOMS.
GREAT.
NOW THE REST OF US ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE JERKS THIS SUNDAY.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID ISAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CAVED, NICE TO SEE YOU.
HOW YOU DOING?
>> DOING GREAT.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "MOM: A CELEBRATION OF MOTHERS FROM
STORYCORPS."
>> THAT'S THE NPR THING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO IN
>> WE PUT A BOOTH SIX AND A HALF YEARS AGO IN GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL.
SMALL BOOTH.
YOU BRING ANYONE YOU WANT, YOUR GRANDMOTHER, YOUR MOM, ANYONE YOU WANT TO HONOR BY LISTENING
TO THEIR STORY.
THE DOOR IS SHUT.
YOU SIT ACROSS FROM YOUR MOM FOR 40 MINUTES AND YOU TALK AND LISTEN AND INTERVIEW HER ABOUT
HER LIFE.
AT THE END OF 30 MINUTES, TWO C.D.s ARE BURNED.
ONE GOES HOME WITH YOU, ONE GOES TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
>> Stephen: SO THIS BECOMES PART OF THE NATIONAL RECORD.
AND YOU TAKE SOMEONE TO THE BOOTH AND MAKE THEM LISTEN TO YOU.
>> IF YOU WANT.
>> Stephen: THIS WAS IN GRAND CENTRAL STATION?
>> IT WAS.
WE HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO REMOVE IT?
DID SOMEONE GO IN THERE AND TRY TO BECOME A MOM IN THERE?
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN, NO?
LOCK THE DOOR.
ALL THIS ACTION OUT THERE.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS NOW?
>> WE'VE HAD ABOUT 30,000 INTERVIEWS WITH ABOUT 60,000 PEOPLE.
BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.
WE WANT TO DO MANY, MANY, MANY THOUSANDS MORE.
>> Stephen: THESE GET PLAYED FRIDAY MORNINGS.
>> ONE OUT OF MANY HUNDREDS.
>> Stephen: WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT THE START OUT MY FRIDAYS WEEPING LIKE A CHILD?
[LAUGHTER]
UNBELIEVABLY TOUCHING THESE STORIES.
THESE ARE VERY, VERY MOVING STORIES.
>> I THINK WHAT'S TOUCHING ABOUT THE STORIES IS THEY'RE AUTHENTIC.
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH PHONINESS, THAT WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING AUTHENTIC, IT CUTS TO
THE HEAR.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU MEAN BY "AUTHENTIC."
THEN THING THAT DISTURBS ME ABOUT THE BOOK IS THAT IT'S NOT PACKED WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE.
>> NOT ONE, NO.
REGULAR PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BUT AREN'T FAMOUS PEOPLE MORE INTERESTING?
[LAUGHTER]
THAN REGULAR PEOPLE?
ISN'T THAT HOW THEY BECOME FAMOUS?
>> I THINK WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU READ THIS BOOK, EVERYDAY PEOPLE,
OUR STORIES, OUR PARENTS' STORIES, OUR NEIGHBORS' STORIES ARE AS INTERESTING.
I WON'T SAY MORE INTERESTING.
>> Stephen: NOW BYING WITH IN YOUR BOOK, THEY ARE FAMOUS.
OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NONE OF THEM PARTICIPATED IN STORYCORPS TO GET FAMOUS.
IT'S REALLY ABOUT HONORING A LOVED ONE BY LISTENING TO THEIR STORY.
SO IT'S A DIFFERENT MOTIVATION.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT MOMS BY LISTENING TO ALL THESE BOMB STORIES?
IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A BIOLOGICAL MOM, BUT WHAT IS A MOM?
BECAUSE ISN'T A MOM IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: YEAH?
>> YES, BUT I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE HERE ARE MOSTLY BIOLOGICAL MOMS.
>> Stephen: FREAKY SOCIETY,
MAN.
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.
>> Stephen: HEATHER HAS TWO MOMMIES AT THIS POINT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY MOMMIES,
LIPSTICK MOM AND LIKE SLASHER MOM, THE WHOLE COMBO?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE SURROGATE MOMS AND DONOR MOMS?
>> IT'S LIKE NOAH'S ARK.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU TO COMPARING THOSE PEOPLE TO ANIMALS, BY THE WAY, BECAUSE IF
I SAID IT, I GET IN TROUBLE, BUT IF ABNPR GUY SAID IT... OKAY.
GO AHEAD.
WHAT IS A MOM?
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?
>> I THINK WHAT YOU LEARN FROM READING THESE STORIES IS THAT,
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHERE THESE MOMS COCOME FROM, AND IT'S EVERY SORT OF MOM, THEY ALL SHARE A
LOT IN COMMON.
IT'S THIS FIERCE DEVOTION AND LOVE AND, YOU KNOW, WISDOM.
THESE ARE, YOU KNOW, AGAIN,
THESE ARE STORIES THAT REMIND US, WHEN YOU TAKE THE TIME TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE AROUND YOU,
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND POWER AND POETRY AND GRACE IN THESE STORIES, AND IT'S KIND OF A
BEAUTIFUL THING.
>> Stephen: MOTHER'S DAY IS COMING UP THIS WEEKEND, AND OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE A GREAT GIFT.
>> I THINK SO.
>> Stephen: BUT DO MOMS WANT TO BE WISE AND BELOVED?
>> MOST OF THE MOMS I KNOW WANT TO BE SMOKING HOT.
>> RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THEY GO ON DIETS AND TORTURE THEMSELVES WITH EXERCISE AND THEY WANT TO BE PERCEIVED AS
COOL AND SEXY.
>> UH-HUH.
WELL, THERE'S SOME OF THAT IN THE BOOK, AS WELL.
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.
YOU HAVE BAD MOMS.
THE BOOK IS SEXY.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A CHAPTER ON MILFs IN THIS THING IN
>> THAT WILL BE THE FOLLOW-UP.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU SAY?
>> THAT WILL BE THE FOLLOW-UP.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE A BIG SELLER.
>> I'M SURE IT WOULD BE.
>> Stephen: DAVID ISAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THE BOOK IS "MOM: A CELEBRATION OF MOTHERS FRO STORYCORPS." MOTHER'S DAY IS||
