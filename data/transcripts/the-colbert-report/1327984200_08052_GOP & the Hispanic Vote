>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
NATION, FLORIDA'S PRIMARY IS
TOMORROW AND THE TWO LEADING
GOP CANDIDATES ARE GOING ALL
OUT FOR THE HISPANIC VOTE.
BUT FOR SOME REASON
HISPANICS GET NERVOUS WHEN
REPUBLICANS SAY THEY'RE
COMING FOR THEM.
NOW ONE REASON THEY MIGHT BE
HESITANT IS THAT NEWT
GINGRICH HAS FOUND HIMSELF
IN SOME AGUA CALIENTE OVER
SOMETHING HE SAID IN 2007.
>> WE SHOULD REPLACE BY
LINGIAL EDUCATION WITH
IMMERSION IN ENGLISH SO
PEOPLE LEARN THE COMMON
LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY AND
SO THEY LEARN THE LANGUAGE
OF PROSPERITY, NOT THE
LANGUAGE OF LIVING IN A
GHETTO.
>> Stephen: YES, ENGLISH IS
THE OWN LANGUAGE OF
PROSPERITY.
BUT TRY TELLING THAT TO
RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD
MEXICAN BILLIONAIRE CARLOS
SLIM.
WHY YOU NO SPECA DA ENGLISH.
OF COURSE NEWT'S OPPONENTS
ARE MAKING HEY OUT OF THIS
GHETTO COMMENT, OR MORE
ACCURATELY HIRING GUATEMALANS
TO MAKE HEY FOR THEM.
JUST LISTEN THIS FROM LAST
WEEK'S DEBATE.
>> YOU HAVE HAD AN AD
RUNNING SAYING THAT SPEAKER
GINGRICH CALLS SPANISH,
QUOTE, THE LANGUAGE OF THE
GHETTO.
>> I DOUBT THAT'S MY AD BUT
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AND FIND
OUT.
>> WE JUST DOABLE TAKED IT
WAS ONE OF YOUR ADS T IS
RUNNING HERE IN FLORIDA, AND
ON THE RADIO.
AND AT THE END YOU SAY I'M
MITT ROMNEY AND A PROVE THIS
AD.
>> Stephen: HEY, WE ALL
ENDORSE THINGS WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT.
LIKE I HAD NO IDEA HOW MY
FACE GOT ON TO EVERY PACKAGE
OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S HORSEY
HOOFSICLES.
WELL, FOLKS, ON SUNDAY NEWT
GINGRICH ANSWERED THE
CHARGES THAT MITT MAY OR MAY
NOT HAVE MADE, JIM?
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW WELL,
GHETTO ORIGINALLY WAS A TERM
FOR A JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS
IN THE MIDDLE AGES.
>> Stephen: YES, EVERYBODY
KNOWS THAT WHEN NEWT SAYS
GHETTO HE'S TALKING ABOUT
SPANISH BEING THE LANGUAGE
OF JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS IN
THE MIDDLE AGES.
AND I FOR ONE SHARE NEWT'S
CONCERN ABOUT THESE MEDDIVE
EL JEWISH SPANISH SPEAKING
MENACES TO SOCIETY.
LIKE HEY, GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU GHETTO HOOLIGANS.
BACK OFF, HOMBRE, FOR WE ARE
BOTH LOCO AND MESHUGGANEH.
OH, HERE THEY GO.
HERE THEY GO WITH THAT
GHETTO MUSIC.
CAMEL MUSIC.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHUTZPAH,
MI HERMANO.
>> Stephen: LEAVE MY STUD
WHY AND I WILL NOT CALL LOS
FEDERALLEST.
>> AMIGO, LET'S LEAVE THE
SCHLEMIL AND TAKE A SIESTA
BUT FIRST WE WILL NORB ON
ENCHI-LATKES, VAYA CON
SHALOM.
>> Stephen: LEARN ENGLISH
YOU NO GOOD -- -- FOLKS THIS
IS WHY WE I HAVE ALWAYS SAID
WE NEED A BORDER WALL WITH
THE 14th CENTURY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
CHEEFERS PLAUS
