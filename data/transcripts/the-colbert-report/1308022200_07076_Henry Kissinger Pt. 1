>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, FOLKS, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
NATION, TONIGHT IT IS MY
SOLEMN PLEDGE THAT I AM NOT
GOING TO BE SAYING ANYTHING
MORE ABOUT ANTHONY WEINER'S
TAIL ROD.
BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ANOTHER PERSON CONNECTED
WITH THE TRICKY DICK IN MY
ONE PART SERIES BETTER KNOW
A HENRY KISSINGER.
TONIGHT HEN KEY KISSINGER,
THE FIGHTING KISSINGER.
KISSINGER WAS THE MOST
FAMOUS PRACTICE TISHNER OF
REAL POLITIC WHICH IS GERMAN
FOR [BLEEP] ABOUT TO GET
REAL.
KISSINGER ALSO OPENED
AMERICAN
RELATIONS-- RELATIONS TO
CHINA DURING THE COLD WAR.
HE SET UP THE FIRST MEETING
BETWEEN NIXON AND MAO BY
SENDING EACH OF THEM A NOTE
SAYING THE OTHER ONE THOUGHT
THEY WERE CUTE.
KISSINGER SUPPORT FOR SECRET
BOMBINGS IN CAMBODIA HAS
EARNED HIM CRITICISM FROM
CHRISTOPHER HITCH ENS,
DANIEL ELSBURG AND EVERYONE
IN CAMBODIA.
NOW I PERSONALLY AM A HUGE
KISSINGER FAN.
KISSING-- KISSINGER GAVE
HOPE TO NERDS EVERYWHERE BY
MAKING NERD SEXY FAMOUSLY
SAYING POWER IS THE ULTIMATE
APHRODISIAC AND BACKED THAT
UP BY SPENDING MUCH OF THE
'70s IN CLOSED DOOR
NEGOTIATIONS WITH GINA LOLLA
BRIDGEA DID.
MARLA THOMAS AN CANDICE
BERGEN.
HE WAS LIKE JAMES BOND WITH
ASTIGMATISM AND JOWLS.
PLEASE WELCOME HENRY
KISSINGER.
DR. KISSINGER, PLEASE DON'T
GET UP, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, AS I WAS
EXPLAINING TO MY AUDIENCE IN
THE SECOND ACT OF THE SHOW
THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE WHO
MAY NOT KNOW THE STATURE OF
THE MAN SITTING BEFORE ME.
YOU HAVE ADVISED MANY
PRESIDENTS UNDER DIPLOMACY.
YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE
TO BOTH NIXON AND FORD.
YOU RECEIVED THE NOBEL PEACE
PRIZE FOR THE PARIS PEACE
ACCORDS IN 1973.
AND YOU'VE GOT A
PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF
FREEDOM.
YOU PUBLISHED NUMEROUS WORKS
ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND
YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "ON
CHINA"
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED
STATES IN THE-- .
>> Stephen: I GOT A BONE TO
PICK WITH YOU ABOUT THAT.
YOU HELPED OPEN THE DOOR TO
CHINA, OKAY.
AND WHEN YOU LEFT, YOU LEFT
THE DOOR OPEN.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CLOSED IT
WHEN YOU LEFT CHINA BECAUSE
NOW CHINA HAS GOTTEN OUT
INTO THE WORLD AND THEY ARE
A MAJOR COMPETITION.
SHOULDN'T I BLAME YOU FOR
SOME OF THE RISE OF CHINA?
>> WELL, TWO THINGS.
WHEN WE FIRST WENT INTO
CHINA IT WAS A VERY UNDER
DEVELOPED COUNTRY.
>> YEAH.
>> AND NOBODY COULD IMAGINE
THAT CHINA WOULD DEVELOP AS
IT DID.
HAD WE KNOWN IT, WE WOULD
STILL HAVE DONE WHAT WE DID.
BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T HANDLE
THE COMPETITION OF ANOTHER
SIGNIFICANT COUNTRY, WE
WOULDN'T BE WHAT WE'VE BEEN.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU ARE NOT
ALLAYING MY FEARS HERE, SIR.
I'M AFRAID THAT CHINA IS
GOING TO BE NUMBER ONE IN
THE WORLD.
PEOPLE KEEP TELLING ME
AMERICA'S HAD THEIR CENTURY.
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE
CHINESE CENTURY.
PLEASE FELL ME THAT'S NOT
THE CASE.
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE
CASE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
PLAUS PLAS
(APPLAUSE)
WOULD YOU, MR. KISSINGER
WOULD YOU GO SO FAR AS TO
SAY U.S.A. NUMBER ONE?
>> I WOULD SAY NOW WE ARE
STILL NUMBER ONE.
I BELIEVE WE WILL REMAIN
NUMBER ONE FOR ANY
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT REAL
POLITICS FOR A SECOND AND
HOW THAT RELATES TO CHINA,
OKAY.
YOU'RE SORT OF THE FACE OF
REAL POLITIC FOR MY
GENERATION.
>> BUT THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE
USE A GERMAN WORD SO THAT
THEY CAN DISMISS MY
ARGUMENTS.
>> Stephen: NOT ME.
NOT ME.
>> NOT YOU?
>> Stephen: NOT ME.
I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF REAL
POLITICS.
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT IS BEST
FOR YOUR COUNTRY, RIGHT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: GAVE YOU THE
BEST ADVANTAGE OF NATIONAL
SECURITY.
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE NATIONAL SECURITY, ABOVE
ALL YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE THE
WORLD AS IT IS AND YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS
AN ELEMENT OF POWER IN THE
WORLD.
BUT THERE IS ALSO WITHOUT
VALUES, A POWER BECOMES
ARBITRARY AND UNMANAGEABLE.
SO YOU NEED BOTH.
>> HOW DOES THE UNITED
STATES OR HOW DOES THE WEST
PERCEIVE THE POWER
RELATIONSHIP?
HOW ARE WE PLAYING THIS GAME
WITH THEM?
YOU'VE SAID THAT WE PLAY
CHESS AND THEY PLAY
SOMETHING MORE LIKE THE GAME
GO, THE CHINESE GAME GO.
WHERE IT'S WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE
TWO?
>> WELL, CHESS, THE PURPOSE
OF CHESS IS TOTAL VICTORY.
THERE IS-- YOU START WITH
ALL THE PIECES ON THE BOARD
AND THEN THERE'S A PROCESS
OF ATTRITION.
AND AT THE END OF IT, THE
OPPONENT IS CHECKMATED.
>> Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THE
COLE WAR WAS LIKE, WE THE
UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES
WERE THE KING AND QUEEN AND
THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE
WORLD WERE THE PAWNS IN
FRONT OF IT?
>> AND FINALLY IT WINDS UP
WITH THE KING, WITH ONE KING
BEING DONE.
THAT'S HOW CHESS-- .
>> Stephen: OR IF YOUR
SISTER IS BEATING YOU AT
CAMP YOU JUST THROW THE
BOARD UP INTO THE AIR AND
RUN AWAY CRYING.
>> WELL-- THAT'S HOW I WIN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I HAVE AN 8-YEAR-OLD
GRANDSON WITH WHOM I PLAY
CHESS.
>> Stephen: DOES HE BEAT
YOU.
>> HE IS STARTING TO BEAT
ME.
SO I HAVE STOPPED PLAYING
WITH HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OH.
YOU'LL NEGOTIATE WITH MAO
TSE TUNG BUT WILL YOU CUT
OFF RELATIONSHIP WITH AN
8-YEAR-OLD.
TELL Y
