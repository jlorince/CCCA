SCARBOROUGH BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT IF YOU HAD NOT INSPIRED ME.
FOLKS -- I TELL YOU THIS GUN CONTROL DEBATE IS GETTING OUT OF HAND.
LIBERALS ARE LETTING THEIR EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF THEM.
WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK.
OKAY, LIKE THIS BUT WITH FEET.
[LAUGHTER]
KEEP THIS DEBATE BASED ON LOGIC AND REASON.
ONE PERSON TAKING MANY STEPS BACK IS TEXAS REPUBLICAN AND PROUD OWNER OF THE "PETTICOAT
JUNCTION" DVD BOX SET, LOUIE GOHMERT.
LISTEN TO HIS CLEAR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOU CAN'T LIMIT LARGE CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
>> WELL, ONCE YOU MAKE IT TEN, THEN WHY WOULD YOU DRAW THE LINE AT TEN?
AND THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU DRAW THAT LIMIT, IT'S KIND OF LIKE MARRIAGE, WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOT
A MAN AND A WOMAN ANYMORE, THEN WHY NOT HAVE THREE MEN AND ONE WOMAN, OR FOUR WOMEN AND ONE
MAN, OR WHY NOT SOMEBODY HAS A LOVE FOR AN ANIMAL?
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: A SOUND ARGUMENT -- IN THAT HE MADE A SOUND.
[LAUGHTER]
LOUIE IS RIGHT.
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.
AND HE'S RIGHT: ONCE YOU START PUTTING BULLETS LIMITS ON MAGAZINE SIZE, WHERE DOES IT STOP?
NINE, ELEVEN?
THEN SOME OTHER STUFF HE SAID, BLAH BLAH BLAH ORGY IN THE BARN.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M A HUNTER.
IF I DON'T HAVE A 30 ROUND CLIP TO SHOOT THESE ANIMALS, WHAT WILL STOP ME FROM HAVING SEX
WITH THEM?
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S BASIC LOGIC: IF A = B, AND B= C, THEN SOONER OR LATER, YOU'RE BANGING A BEE, SEE?
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T MIND ADMITTING THIS PAST SEASON, I WAS OUT HUNTING WHITETAIL DEER WITH THE BOYS.
SUDDENLY, THIS LONG-LEGGED DOE COMES PRANCING INTO MY SIGHTS WITH THOSE BIG, BROWN EYES,
THOSE SINEWY HAUNCHES, THAT COME-HITHER FLICK OF AN UPTURNED TAIL, AND I THOUGHT, "GUN TO ITS
HEAD?" YOU BET.
[LAUGHTER]
ESPECIALLY IF THAT GUN DOESN'T HAVE BULLETS.
BECAUSE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THAT DOE IS GETTING MOUNTED.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE NOW WELL-ESTABLISHED FACT THAT GUN CONTROL CAUSES BESTIALITY.
[LAUGHTER]
AS LOUIE GOHMERT'S LOGICAL ARGUMENT HAS PROVEN, ANY LIBERAL POLICY EVENTUALLY LEADS TO SEX
WITH ANIMALS.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S A LITTLE GAME I CALL "SIX DEGREES OF HUMPING BACON."
[LAUGHTER]
JUST TAKE THE LIBERALS' FAVORITE CAUSE: CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU PUT A CAP ON CARBON EMISSIONS, THAT'S LIKE PUTTING A CONDOM ON A SMOKE STACK.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT WERE CONDOMS ORIGINALLY MADE OF?
SHEEP INTESTINE.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SAYING "HEY, LET'S CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN" AND HELLO DOLLY!
OR TAKE RAISING TAXES ON THE RICH PEOPLE.
OKAY?
THOSE POOR RICH PEOPLE WILL HAVE LESS DISPOSABLE INCOME.
THAT MEANS LESS DONATIONS TO THINGS LIKE MUSEUMS, PARKS AND ZOOS.
THOSE ZOO ANIMALS AREN'T PROPERLY GUARDED AND THEY ESCAPE INTO THE CITY, WHERE TO GET BY,
THEY HAVE TO TURN TRICKS AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE DOING THE NO-NO WITH A BONOBO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
