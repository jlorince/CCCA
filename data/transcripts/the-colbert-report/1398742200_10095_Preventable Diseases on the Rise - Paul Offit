THE POINT IS THERE ISNOTHING TO FEAR FROM PEOPLE
WHO FEAR VACCINES HERE TOTELL US WE'RE ALL GOING TO
DIE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THEVACCINE EDUCATION CENTER AT
THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OFPHILADELPHIA DR. PAUL OFFIT,
DR. OFFIT, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR COMING BACK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL RIGHT,OKAY.
LET'S GET TO IT.
29% OF AMERICANS BELIEVEVACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.
BUT APPARENTLY YOUSCIENTISTS THINK YOU KNOW
BETTER, OKAY.
DON'T PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHTTO MAKE THE DECISION FOR
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIRCHILDREN ALONE WHAT IS BEST
FOR THEM?
>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,THEY'RE NOT MAKING THE
DECISION FOR THEIR CHILDRENALONE.
WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO PUT YOURCHILD AT RISK OF GETTING A
VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASE YOU'RE ALSO PUTTING
EVERYONE WHO THEY COME INCONTACT AT RISK.
>> THOSE PEOPLE CAN GETVACCINES.
>> BUT OFTEN THEY TOO, THOSECHILDREN TOO HAVE A PARENT
THAT IS CHOOSING NOT TOVACCINATE.
>> Stephen: WELL THAT IS THECHOICE OF THE PARENT, THE
PARENT KNOWS BEST FOR THECHILD.
>> BUT DO THEY.
>> Stephen: YES THEY DO,OKAY.
THEY DO.
>> IF A PARENT KNOWS IF APARENT IS NOT GETTING A
VACCINE FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSETHEY FEAR AS YOU ELUDED TO
EARLIER THAT IT IS CAUSINGAUTISM THEN WHAT THEY ARE
DOING IS JUST PUTTING ASIDEAN ENORMOUS AMOUNT, A
MOUNTAIN OF SCIENCE.
THERE IS NOW MORE THAN 20STUDIES THAT SHOW
VACCINES DON'T CAUGHT AUTISM.
THE MMR DIDN'T CAUGHTAUTISM.
THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP.
>> Stephen: BUT 29% OFAMERICANS STILL BELIEVE THAT,
SURELY THEY ARE AT LEAST 29%RIGHT.
>> POPULAR BELIEF IS NOTALWAYS POPULAR WISDOM.
THERE ARE MANY THINGS ONEDOESN'T KNOW ABOUT AUTISM
WHAT YOU DO KNOW IS THATVACCINES DON'T CAUSE IT.
>> BUT THERE IS, YOU HAVE TOADMIT THAT THE AMOUNT OF
VACCINATION GIVEN TO YOUNGCHILDREN INCREASED IN THE
90s.
AND THE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISMROSE AT THE SAME TIME.
THAT'S A COROLLARY AFFECT,OKAY.
IT IS THE SAME WAY THAT THEIPHONE IS INTRODUCED AND
WORLD WAR II VETS STARTDYING.
(LAUGHTER)>> IN THE SAME DECADE.
IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOMETHINGTO DO WITH EACH OTHER.
>> YOU KNOW ITS PERFECTLYREASONABLE FOR THE PARENT TO
ASK THE QUESTION.
MY CHILD WAS FINE, THEY GOTA VACCINE, NOW THEY AREN'T
FINE, IT IS AN ANSWERABLEQUESTION, IT HAS BEEN
ANSWERED AGAIN AND AGAIN ANDAGAIN.
THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THE29% STILL THINK THAT
VACCINES MAY BE A PROBLEM.
WHEN THEY ARE SHOWN NOT TOBE.
>> YOU HEAD UP SOMETHINGCALLED THE VACCINE EDUCATION
CENTER.
THE FACT THAT WE NEED AVACCINE EDUCATION CENTER
DOESN'T IT MEAN YOU HAVEALREADY LOST THE FIGHT?
BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU ARERIGHT, VACCINES ARE SO GREAT,
WHY DO WE NEED TO BEEDUCATED ABOUT IT.
>> WE SHOULDN'T BE.
I MEAN THEIR RECORDS SHOULDSTAND ON THEIR OWN.
IN THE 1920s DIPTHERIA WASONE OF THE MOST COMMON
KILLERS OFTEENAGERS.
IN THE 50s POLIO RAVAGEDAMERICAN CHILDREN CAUSING
TENS OF THOUSANDS OFCASES OF PARALYSIS.
MEASLES BEFORE THE VACCINEIN 1963 CAUSED 48,000
CHILDREN TO BE HOSPITALIZEDAND 500 TO DIE.
NOW WE LARGELY DON'T SEETHOSE, THEY ARE STARTING TO
COME BACK A LITTLE BITBECAUSE PARENTS ARE MAKING
THESE CHOICES BECAUSE THEYHAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THESE
DISEASE, NOT ONLY HAD WELARGELY ELIMINATED THEM BUT
WE ELIMINATED THE MEMORY SOPEOPLE AREN'T SCARED.
UNFORTUNATELY THEY MAY HAVETO GET SCARED OF THEM
AGAIN, WHICH IS SAD.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF I WERETO TELL YOU SOUND LIKE YOU
ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIGPHARMA.
THEY MAKE THE INOCULATIONS,THEY ARE MAKING MONEY,
GREASING YOUR PALMS THAT ISOUT THERE NOW, RESPOND TO
IT.
>> YEAH, SO-- (APPLAUSE)
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING TOME THAT WE JUST KEEP
KNOCKING BIG PHARMA WHEN INFACT YOU CAN'T ON THE ONE
HAND PRAISE THE FACT THATTHESE VACCINES HAVE SAVED
THEIR LIVES, HAVE ALLOWEDOUR CHILDREN TO LIVE LONGER,
BETTER, HEALTHIER LIVES ANDTHEN SAY THAT JUST DISMISS
THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT,THAT MAKE THESE VACCINES
SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WANT TO-- IF YOU WANTTO PLAY THE LONGER BETTER
HEALTHIER LIVES CARD,THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
WELL, DOCTOR, THANK YOU SOMUCH FOR JOINING ME.
DR. PAUL OFFIT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
