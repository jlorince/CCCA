NOW, YOUNG LADY, HOW WAS LONDON?
>> LONDON WAS GREAT, I HAD A GLORIOUS TIME.
IT WAS FUN.
>> Stephen: DID YOU EVER THINK WHEN YOU WERE A KID-- HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED BOXING?
>> I WAS 11.
>> Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU-- THERE WERE A LOT OF SPORTS OUT THERE, YOU KNOW?
YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED BASKETBALL, YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED SOFTBALL, WHY BOXING?
>> I JUST SIMPLY-- TO MAKE IT SIMPLE, I LOVE HITTING PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER).
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT A WAITRESS.
>> (LAUGHS).
>> Stephen: I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS INTERVIEW.
WHAT IS IT YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT HITTING THE PEOPLE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK IT MUST BE ABOUT WHEN SHALL BE HITS ME AND THEN WHEN I HIT THEM BACK IT'S LIKE THEY CAN
HIT ME HARD AND I'M LIKE "OKAY, I'M ABOUT TO HIT YOU BACK HARDER." AND SOMETIMES I MAKE THEM CRY AND THAT'S A WONDERFUL THING.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IS THERE CRYING IN BOXING?
DO PEOPLE SOMETIMES CRY UP THERE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS CRYING IN BOXING?
>> THE GIRL I BEAT CRIED.
>> Stephen: SO FOR THE GOLD MEDAL YOU FOUGHT A US AREKY, OKAY?
YOU FOUGHT A RUSSKY.
WHAT COUNTRY IS IT MOST SATISFYING TO PUNCH IN THE FACE?
>> (LAUGHS) ALL OF THEM!
(APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
CAN I SEE THE GOLD MEDAL?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT THING IS HEAVY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO BE IN SHAPE JUST TO WEAR IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: SO HOW MUCH TRAINING?
WHAT'S YOUR DAY LIKE?
HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND IN THE RING TRAINING?
>> WELL, UP IN FLINT I USUALLY GO DOWN-- I RUN IN THE MORNING AND THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT AN HOUR, THEN I SLEEP THROUGH THE
DAY THEN PROBABLY 6:00 TO 8:30 I WORK OUT.
SO THAT'S EIGHT HOURS DURING THE DAY.
SO TRAINING CAMP WAS DIFFERENT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU LIVE IN FLYNT, MICHIGAN, AND YOU ENJOY PUNCHING PEOPLE.
DO YOU EVER RUN INTO MICHAEL MOORE BECAUSE HE'S FROM FLINT-- JUST FOR ME, JUST GO-- "THIS ONE IS FROM STEPHEN COLBERT."
(LAUGHTER) RIGHT ACROSS THE CHOPS.
HE'S A HEAVY-- WHAT WEIGHT CLASS ARE YOU?
>> MIDDLE WEIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS THAT A COMPLIMENT FOR A WOMAN?
>> (LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: MIHDAR LING YOU'RE A MIDDLE WEIGHT TONIGHT.
>> YEAH, IT'S BETTER THAN PEOPLE SAYING HEAVYWEIGHT.
THAT'S AN INSULT I THINK.
>> Stephen: ARE THERE HEAVYWEIGHTS?
DO WOMEN GO UP TO HEAVYWEIGHTS?
>> YEAH, UP IN WOMEN'S BOXING IF YOU'RE OVER 178 POUNDS THEY CALL YOU A HEAVYWEIGHT.
>> Stephen: NOW, AS THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL, YOU'RE THE FIRST, YOU'RE A PIONEER.
BUT WHO WERE THE ROLE MODELS?
WHO ARE THE BOXERS YOU SAID "I WANT TO BOX LIKE THAT"?
>> IT WASN'T EVEN WOMEN.
I LOOKED AT JOE LOUIS, SUGAR RAY ROBINSON, TOMMY HEARNS, I NEVER LOOKED AT ANY OF THE WOMEN.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FIRST OLYMPIC CHAMPION FOR WOMEN SO YOU-- IN SOME WAYS YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP TO YOURSELF.
(LAUGHTER) WHICH IS BIG SHOES TO FILL.
(LAUGHTER) BUT I THINK YOU CAN DO IT.
>> YEAH, I CAN DO IT.
YEAH.
>> Stephen: DID I JUST BLOW YOUR MIND?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I NEVER-- I ALWAYS TRY NOT TO THINK TOO BIG ABOUT IT.
REALLY WHEN I'M BOGGING I NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT ANY OTHER FEMALE BOXER.
I WAS JUST LIKE "I IMMEDIATE TO BE BETTER THAN WHOEVER'S OUT THERE."
>> Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE STYLE IN THE RING.
A LOT OF OLYMPIC BOXING IS STAID, VERY-- VERY QUIET AND FORMAL.
BUT YOU HAD A LITTLE RAZZLE DAZZLE OUT THERE.
DID THAT THROW YOUR OPPONENTS?
>> RAZZLE DAZZLE?
UM--
>> Stephen: IT'S A TECHNICAL TERM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK IT DID.
YOU KNOW, LIKE NOBODY MOVES THEIR HEAD LIKE ME, NOBODY DOES THIS THAT LIKE I DO.
(APPLAUSE) (LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
CAN YOU-- I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE UNITED STATES-- THE UNITED STATES HAS YOU AS OUR PIONEER IN THIS BUT I
WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT NOT TO HIT A LADY, OKAY?
IS IT OKAY FOR ME TO DO THAT NOW?
(LAUGHTER)
>> UM-- DON'T HIT ME.
>> Stephen: DON'T HIT YOU?
NO, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE LAST PUNCH I EVER THROW.
(LAUGHTER) DO I LOOK PUNCHABLE?
I'VE BEEN TOLD I'VE GOT A PUNCHABLE HEAD.
(LAUGHTER) WHERE WOULD YOU PUNCH ME?
RIGHT HERE?
A (LAUGHS) RIGHT HERE?
AND THEN ONCE THE BLOOD STOPPED-- (LAUGHTER).
WOULD YOU JUST HERE IS MY HEAD OFF WITH ONE PUNCH?
>> NO, I WOULD SAY SORRY FOR HITTING YOU.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE.
BUT IT WOULD FEEL GOOD FOR YOU BECAUSE I WOULD START CRYING.
>> (LAUGHS) YEAH, THAT WOULD MAKE MY DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, PLEASE COME BACK ANOTHER TIME AND THROW A PUNCH AT ME.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST CLARESSA SHIELDS!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
