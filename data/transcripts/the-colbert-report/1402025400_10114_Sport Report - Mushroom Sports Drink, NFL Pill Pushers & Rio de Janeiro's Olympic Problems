FOLKS, THE NEW YORK TIMES IS NOWREPORTING THAT THERE
WERE FIXED SOCCER MATCHESLEADING UP TO THE 2010
WORLD CUP,  BUT I DON'T BELIEVETHAT SOCCER IS FIXED
BECAUSE NOTHING CAN FIX THATGAME.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FIRST NEXT, WHEN IT COMES TOINTERNATIONAL SPORT NO ONE
TAKES IT  MORE SERIOUSLY THANOUR ENEMIES IN NORTH KOREA.
TO THEM, EVERY GAME IS "THEHUNGER GAMES."
AND NOW, THEIR ATHLETES COULDBECOME KIM JONG UN-BEATABLE.
>> A NEW SPORTS DRINK ISCLAIMING TO ENHANCE PHYSICAL
ABILITY AND SPEED RECOVERY ANDIT'S ALL DUE TO THE MIRACLE
INGREDIENT-- MUSHROOM FUNGUS.
>> NORTH KOREAN SCIENTISTS SAYTHE DRINK IS VERY EFFECTIVE.
>> Stephen:  YES, NORTH KOREAHAS DEVELOPED A MUSHROOM-BASED
SPORTS DRINK, WHICH BRINGS ME TOTHE FIRST-EVER INSTALLMENT OF
SPORT REPORT - SPORE REPORT.
WHERE ATHLETES--( APPLAUSE )
WHERE ATHLETES AND FUNGUS COMETOGETHER AND FOR ONCE, NOT IN
THEIR JOCKS.
ACCORDING TO THE KOREAN CENTRALNEWS AGENCY, D.P.R.K. SCIENTISTS
HAVE "SUCCEEDED IN FINDING THEWAY TO CULTIVATE MUSHROOM FUNGUS
AND MADE A FUNCTIONAL DRINK.
THIS NATURAL DRINK IS VERYEFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING
PHYSICAL ABILITIES OF SPORTSPERSONS AND RECOVERING FROM
THEIR FATIGUES."
ENHANCING SPORTS PERSONS ANDRECOVERING FROM FATIGUES.
THAT IS A ONE-TWO PUNCHING WECAN'T BE OF COMPETITION TOWARDS.
NEED MORE PROOF NORTH KOREA ISSHII-TAKING THIS
MUSHROOM PROGRAM SERIOUSLY?
LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OF KIMJONG-UN.
IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THEMUSHROOMS END AND HIS HAIRCUT
BEGINS. NOW LUCKILY FOR US, ONEAMERICAN COMPANY ALREADY
HAS A POTENT MUSHROOM-BASEDSPORTS DRINK-- IT'S CAMPBELL'S.
THEIR CREAM OF MUSHROOMSOUP REALLY HELPS
REPLENISH YOUR BODY'S NATURALSOUPS.
CAMPBELL'S, IF YOU'RE SMART,YOU'LL RENAME THIS THIRST
QUENCHER, CAMPBELL'S NEWSPORT-O-BELLOW.
THAT SMELLS LIKE VICTORY, AND ALITTLE LIKE A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE.
SECOND NEXT UP, FOLKS, I LOVEFOOTBALL.
I D.V.R. EVERY GAME, AND SO DOTHE PLAYERS BECAUSE IT'S THE
ONLY WAY THEY CAN REMEMBER WHATHAPPENED.
THAT'S WHY I'M SO DISGUSTED BYTHE BETRAYAL CURRENTLY
PLAYING OUT IN THE NFL WHEREOVER 500 FORMER PLAYERS HAVE
JOINED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THELEAGUE THAT MADE THEM FAMOUS AND
DRUG ADDICTED INVALIDS.  A NEWLAWSUIT ALLEGES NFL TEAMS AND
THEIR DOCTORS KNOWINGLY GAVEPLAYERS AN ARRAY OF PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS AND PAIN KILLERS FOR YEARSAND YEARS WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR
THE LONG-TERM DAMAGE.
>> FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYERS BYTHE HUNDREDS CLAIM THE LEAGUE
ILLEGALLY DRUGGED THEM TO MAKESURE THEY COULD STAY IN THE
GAME.
IN MANY CASES DID NOT EVEN TELLTHEM WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM.
>> OUR PLAYERS WERE SHOT UP LIKECATTLE.
THEY WERE BROUGHT TO MARKET, ANDTHEN DISCARDED LIKE PIECES OF
MEAT.
>> Stephen:  WHAT ANEXAGGERATION.
AMERICA'S CATTLE ARE GIVEN FARFEWER DRUGS.
AND OH, WHAT WONDERFUL PAINKILLING DRUGS THEY WERE.
IT WAS LIKE WILLY WONKA AND THEEVER-LASTING THROB STUFFERS.
NOT ONLY DID YOU HAVE PERCODAN,PERCOCET, VICODIN, BUT ALSO
AMBIEN.
SO IF YOU EVER THOUGHT THE JETSLOOKED LIKE THEY WERE ASLEEP OUT
THERE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHAT REALLY SADDENS ME--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HUGE FANS OF THE JETS ORNARCOTICS OUT HERE TONIGHT.
WHAT REALLY SADDENS ME, FOLKS,IS THREE OF THE PLAINTIFFS ARE
MEMBERS OF MY BELOVED 1985 SUPERBOWL CHAMPION CHICAGO BEARS WHO
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN WERE JACKEDON SOMETHING WHEN THEY MADETHIS.
>>  (RAPPING) WE'RE NOT HERE TOSTART NO TROUBLE.
WE'RE JUST HERE TO DO THE SUPERBOWL SHUFFLE
>> Stephen:  HOW COULD YOUSUE THE NFL?
YOU GAVE YOUR WORD YOU WEREN'THERE TO START NO TROUBLE.
NEXT, FINALLY, THE OLYMPICS.
FOLKS, THE SUMMER GAMES ARE JUSTTWO YEARS AWAY IN RIO DE
JANEIRO, THE PERFECT CITY TOCARRY ON THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST
OLYMPICS BECAUSE EVERYONE THEREIS ALREADY OILED UP AND NAKED.
( LAUGHTER )AND, FOLKS, EXCITEMENT IS
BUILDING IN RIO.
IN FACT, THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLYTHING THAT'S BUILDING.
>> HOST CITY RIO DE JANEIRO ISSO FAR BEHIND IN ITS
PREPARATIONS.
>> THE PROJECT IS FACINGUNPRECEDENTED DELAYS.
>> ROADS GOING NOWHERE,UNFINISHED STANDS.
AND AN AWFUL LOT OF CONSTRUCTIONWORK STILL TO DO.
>> THE TOP OLYMPICS OFFICIAL ISSLAMMING PREPARATIONS FOR THE
2016 GAMES IN RIO, CALLING THEMTHE WORST HE'S EXPERIENCED IN
NEARLY 40 YEARS.
>> Stephen:  THE WORST EVEREXPERIENCED.
AND THAT IS SAYING SOMETHINGBECAUSE THERE ARE STILL SOME
OLYMPIC ATHLETES TRAPPED INTHEIR SOCHI HOTEL BATHROOMS.
BUT, FOLKS, THERE IS ONE EVENTTHAT WILL BE MORE AFFECTED BY
THE DELAYS THAN ANY OTHER--SAILING.
BECAUSE RIO'S GUANABARA BAY ISSO FILLED WITH RAW SEWAGE AND
GARBAGE, THAT ONE SAILOR'SDINGHY CRASHED INTO WHAT HE
BELIEVED WAS A PARTLY SUBMERGEDSOFA.
AND ANOTHER ONE ENCOUNTEREDHUMAN CORPSES ON FOUR OCCASIONS
WHILE SAILING IN THE BAY.
FOUR CORPSES, FOLKS.
THAT'S BAD.
THE SOFA ONLY HOLDS THREE.
( LAUGHTER )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
