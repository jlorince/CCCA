NATION, THANK YOU.
NATION, WE HAVE WON THE WAR, BUT
WHAT IS NEXT FOR IRAQ?
MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN TURN THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY INTO A
DISNEYLAND.
ALL OF THOSE OUT-OF-WORK SADDAM
DOUBLES WOULD MAKE GREAT CAPTAIN
HOOKS.
HERE TO TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE
FUTURE OF IRAQ, PLEASE WELCOME
THE FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL
FOR THE U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ AND
MY FORMER HAIRSTYLIST, GENERAL
RAY ODIERNO.
GENERAL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[THE A-TEAM THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
THANK YOU, SIR.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.
BY THE WAY, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
GET UP FOR ME.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, SIR, YOU'RE A FOUR-STAR
GENERAL.
IS IT DISAPPOINTING THAT YOU
HAVEN'T ACHIEVED FIVE?
[LAUGHTER]
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WITH YOUR LIFE?
>> TO BE HONEST, STEPHEN, I
NEVER THOUGHT I'D MAKE FOUR, SO
I'M PRETTY HAPPY.
>> Stephen: I THINK YOU
DESERVE FIVE.
I'M GIVING YOU THE COLBERT BUMP
RIGHT NOW.
FIVE FOR THIS MAN.
YOU ARE NOW THE FORMER COMMANDER
OF U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ.
HAS IT BEEN HARD THE LAST WEEK
NOT COMMANDING FORCES?
ARE YOU TEMPTED TO USE YOUR
COUNTER-INSURGENCY STRATEGIES
LIKE AT THE COSTCO?
>> I'VE TRIED TO USE MY WIFE,
BUT I FAILED MISERABLY, STEPHEN.
IT'S MUCH EASIER WITH 100,000
TROOPS.
>> YOU ARE SOMETIMES CALLED THE
ARCHITECT OF THE SURGE.
SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WOULDN'T
WORK.
I WASN'T ONE OF THEM.
I WAS BEHIND YOU THE ENTIRE
TIME.
CHECK THE TAPE.
YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ME SAYING THEY
WASN'T IN FAVOR OF THE SURGE.
THE SURGE WORKED.
HOW DOES MAN OF YOUR STRENGTH
AND STATURE SAY NANNY, NANNY,
BOO, BOO?
>> WELL, WHAT I SAY IS I SAY
THANK YOU TO PEOPLE LIKE THIS
OUT HERE, ALL THESE GREAT
MARINES, SOLDIERS, SAILORS AND
AIRMEN WHO MADE IT WORK.
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MADE IT
WORK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: GOOD POINT.
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT, SIR.
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
NOW, BUT WHO REALLY WON THE WAR?
WAS IT THE ARMY, THE NAVY, THE
AIR FORCE OR THE MARINES?
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
JUST PICK ONE.
NO ONE WILL BE OFFENDED.
>> THE PEOPLE WHO WON THE WAR
WERE U.S. FORCES IRAQ.
THAT'S WHO WON THE WAR.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OKAY.
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE
NON-COMBAT TROOPS.
ISN'T A NON-COMBAT TROOP A MIME
TROOP?
THOSE GUYS IN THE ARMY AREN'T
HAVING A PICNIC.
>> STEPHEN, I'LL TELL YOU ALL OF
THE SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRCRAFT
MARINES ARE ABLE TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES AND DO WHAT WE ASK
THEM TO DO EVERY DAY.
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE IRAQIS
ARE DOING THE COMBAT OPERATIONS.
OUR GUYS, WHO ARE VERY CAPABLE,
ARE ADVISING AND ASSISTING AND
HELPING THEM TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen: ARE THEY GETTING
COMBAT PAY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T THAT MAKE
THEM COMBAT TROOPS?
FOLLOW THE MONEY I SAY.
>> THEY ARE ABLE TO DO WHATEVER
I ASK THEM TO DO.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
COMING HERE TO HELP ME CELEBRATE
THE WORK ALL OF THESE YOUNG MEN
AND WOMEN HAVE DONE.
THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER,
YOU GAVE ME A VERY SPECIAL
HAIRCUT.
YOU GAVE ME YOUR HAIRCUT, BUT
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK OVER HERE,
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I SAVED
MY HAIR.
AND I'VE PUT IT TOGETHER TO GIVE
YOU MY HAIRCUT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND ON BEHALF... SIR, MAY I?
MAY I?
>> SURE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
GENERAL RAY ODIERNO
