NOW, NATION, WE ARE JUST FOURDAYS INTO OUR LATEST WAR.
FOR MORE, LET'S GO TOSOMETHING LOUD AND FLASHY.
DA-DA-DA.
DUN-DUN-DUN.
AIRSTRIKES ON TERROR!
SYRIA'S BUSINESS.
SHOVE IT UP THEIR ISIL!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )JIMMY?
JIMMY, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOINGTO FIX THE SOUND ON THAT.
>> WE DID.
>> Stephen:  GREAT!
SOUNDS GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.
FOLKS, AS EXCITED AS I AM THATWE'RE FINALLY DROPPING BOMBS, IF
I WERE IN CHARGE, I'D MAKE IT ALITTLE BOMBIER.
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
>> THIS IS PART OF THE BOMBDAMAGE ASSESSMENT.
THERE YOU SEE THE PICTURE BEFOREOF A FACILITY, AND THEN AFTER,
AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
>> YOU ALMOST HAVE TO LOOKTWICE.
>> YOU HAVE TO LOOK TWICE.
THEY BLEW UP HALF THE BUILDINGWHERE MOST OF THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENTWAS.
>> THAT'S JUST IT.
WHY DIDN'T THEY BLOW UP THEWHOLE BUILDING.
ESSENTIALLY, THEY KNOCKED OUTCABLE TV FOR THAT BUILDING.
>> WHY DIDN'T THEY BLOW UP THEWHOLE THING.
ALL THE AIRSTRIKES ARE DOING ISKNOCKING OUT ISIS'S CABLE.
THOUGH THEY WILL BE SUCKED INTOA QUAGMIRE WITH A SOULLESS
ENEMY.
THAT'S AGAINST THE GENEVACONVENTION.
PLUS, MISSILES AREN'T ENOUGHHERE.
WE NEED BOOTS ON THE GROUND, YETOBAMA REFUSES TO SEND TROOPS ON
THE FLIMSY EXCUSE THAT NO ONE INTHE WORLD THINKS THAT'S A GOOD
IDEA.
FORTUNATELY, THERE'S A NEW PLANFROM AMERICA'S GREATEST MILITARY
MIND.
>> WE NEED A WORLDWIDE STRIKEFORCE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE
HOT SPOTS IN THE WORLD ANDCONFRONT ISLAMIC TERRORISM,
JIHADDISTS ON THE GROUND.
WE NEED THAT.
BUT WHY SHOULD THE UNITEDSTATES HAVE TO PROTECT THE WHOLE
WORLD?
SO MY IDEA IS TO RAISE A FORCEOF 25,000 MERCENARIES,
WELL PAID. IF YOU DON'T PAY, YOUDON'T GET ANY PROTECTION.
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANYMILITARY PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME
GOING, "THAT'S A GREAT IDEA."
>> Stephen:  HE'S RIGHT.
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM.
AND YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THESEMERCENARIES WILL BE GOOD GUYS
BECAUSE ONLY THE BEST PEOPLEKILL WHOEVER YOU WANT FOR CASH.
IT'S QUALITY FOLKS LIKE I'MSAYING.
UNLIKE THOSE SUCKERS WHO DO ITFOR LOVE OF COUNTRY.
BUT, SADLY, NOT EVERYONE ISSEEING EYE TO EYE WITH PAPA
BEAR, LIKE THE LEFTIES OVER ATFOX NEWS.
>> WITH YOUR IDEA, YOU'VE GONEFROM
OUT OF THE BOX TO OFF THE WALL.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE RUNNINGAROUND THE WORLD, RESPONSIBLE
FOR A BAND OF DESPERADOES?
>> IT COULD TURN INTO AFRANKENSTEIN FORCE THAT YOU
CAN'T CONTROL WITH UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCES.
>> THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA, ATERRIBLE IDEA, NOT JUST AS
A PRACTICAL MATTER BUT AS AMORAL MATTER.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THISPROBLEM BY CREATING AN ARMY OF
MARVEL AVENGERS OR THE GUARDIANSOF THE GALAXY.
>> Stephen:  OH, COME ON!
PLEASE.
BILL'S PLAN ISN'T LIKE THEAVENGERS OR GUARDIANS OF THE
GALAXY.
THEY'D BE AN ELITE TEAM OF PROSPUTTING THEIR CONSCIENCES ASIDE
TO DISH OUT VIOLENCE FOR BIGMONEY.
SO IT'S LIKE THE NFL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE DRAFTING
OUR TEAMS IN BILL'S FANTASYWARFARE LEAGUE, FOLKS, I'VE GOT
MY OWN PLANS FOR AN ELITE STRIKEFORCE THAT I DREW UP YEARS AGO,
IN MRS. TEMPLETON'S FOURTH GRADEENGLISH CLASS.
AND UNLIKE BILL'S PLAN, MINEDOESN'T NEED 25,000
MERCENAIRES-- JUST 10.
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALLMUTANT DOUBLE NINJA
SUPERSOLDIERS WITH LASERNUNCHUKS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, ISIS DOESN'T STANDA CHANCE AGAINST
"STEVIE'S SOOPER SOLJER SQUAD."
THERE'S BRICK, SNAKE, TANK,SNAKE M., SNAKE R.
A LOT OF THEM ARE NAMED SNAKE SOONLY SNAKE DOESN'T HAVE TO USE
THE LAST INITIAL BECAUSE HESIGNED UP FIRST.
THESE GUYS ARE ALL PRIMED FORTHE KILL BECAUSE THEY WERE
FROZEN IN CRYOSTASIS RIGHT AFTERTHEY SAW THEIR DOG KILLED.
WHICH MEANS WHEN THEYTHAW OUT THEY'RE LIKE
"NOOOOO!"KARATE CHOP!
KARATE CHOP!
PEW PEW PEW!
BACKFLIP!
LAND ON A SKATEBOARD!
PUNCH A DINOSAUR!
AND THIS PART IS IMPORTANT--THEY GET TO STAY UP AS LATE AS
THEY WANT, AND THE ONLY PERSONTHEY ANSWER TO
IS THE CONTESSA.
SHE'S FIRM BUT FAIR.
AND THAT BLACK LEATHER JUMPSUITIS JUST BARELY KEEPING IT ALL IN
THERE FOR MRS. TEMPLETON-- IMEAN THE CONTESSA!
SO LISTEN UP, BILL.
BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE'REPRETENDING THERE'S A WAY TO
FIGHT A WAR THAT DOESN'TINVOLVE SACRIFICE AND THAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND POLITICIANSDON'T HAVE TO FEEL ANY
RESPONSIBILITY FOR, WE SHOULDTHINK BIGGER.
LIKE MAYBE MY INVISIBLE BOMBTHAT BLOWS UP ONLY BAD GUYS.
BILL, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOWMANY MILITARY PEOPLE ARE CALLING
ME AND SAYING THAT'S JUST ASGOOD AS YOUR IDEA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
