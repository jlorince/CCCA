RATE CANDIDATES.
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY SCENESFROM THEIR OWN LIFE AND HAVE
THEM TURN THE DIAL, SEE HOWTHEY FEEL ABOUT IT.

AND I WENT ABOUT TWO MILESAWAY.
AND I DECIDED, I GOT TO STAYON PEOPLE'S COUCHES.
I HAVE TO EAT WITH THEM ANDREALLY GOT TO KNOW WHAT IT

BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TELLINGJOURNALISTS THE STORY.
THEY ARE TO THE GOING TOTALK TO THE COPS.

MAN.

LIKE McDONALD'S, THEY SAY.
THEY HAVE SHIFTS AND PEOPLEWORK IN TEAMS.
AND THEY HAVE A LEADER.
AND HE MAKES ALL THE MONEY.
AND ALL THESE GUYS AREWORKING FOR MINIMUM WAGE BUT
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARERISKING THEIR LIFE EVERY
DAY.
>> Stephen: DO THEY HAVE TOWEAR HAIR NETS.
IS IT REALLY RUN IN ACORPORATE FASHION, THE GANGS
THAT YOU WERE WITH.
>> THEY MODEL THEMSELVESAFTER A CORPORATION.
AND THE CITY HAS A BUNCH OFDIFFERENT FRANCHISES.
AND THEY ALL COME UP TO ABOARD OF DIRECTORS RIGHT ON
THE TOP.
>> Stephen: SO IT IS AFRANCHISE.
I WONDERED WHY EVERY TOWNHAS A CRIPS AND A BLOODS.
>> IT HAS A LITTLE TO DOWITH POVERTY.
AND THE FACT THAT THEY DON'THAVE OTHER ECONOMIC OPORTUNITIES
BUT NOT LIKE McDONALD'S.
BUT YES, WELL, NOT EVERYDOWN BUT MAYBE EVERY TOWN
HAS SOME SORT OF GANG THATIS FIGHTING EACH OTHER,
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO NOW INSTEADOF GANG LEADER FOR A DAY,
DID YOU ACTUALLY LEAD THEGANG FOR A DAY.
>> I WASN'T ACTUALLY THELEADER BUT I GOT TO WALK
NEXT TO THE LEADER AND FINDOUT HOW DO YOU GET 200 GUYS
TO RISK THEIR LIVES EVERYDAY IN THIS REALLY POOR
PLACE FOR MINIMUM WAGE WHATKIND OF LEADER DO YOU HAVE
TO BE.
>> Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TOKNOW, BECAUSE --
>> A PRETTY GOOD ONE.
YOU HAVE TO BE -- YOU HAVETO BE WILLING TO USE
VIOLENCE, RIGHT AWAY.
SO IF TWO PEOPLE ARE LYINGTO YOU, ONE OF THEM STOLE
MONEY, YOU HAVE TO FIGUREOUT WHO AND YOU CAN'T, YOU
KNOW, HAVE THEM RUN LAPS.
YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE CRAPOUT OF THEM.
