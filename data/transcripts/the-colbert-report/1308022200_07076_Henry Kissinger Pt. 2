>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
WE NOW REJOIN MY PEABODY
AWARD-WINNING INTERVIEW CAN
HENRY KISSINGER ALREADY IN
PROGRESS.
WHAT WAS MAO LIKE BECAUSE
THERE AREN'T THAT MANY
PEOPLE COY EVER INTERVIEW
AND SAY WHAT WAS MAO LIKE?
WHAT WAS MAO LIKE, WAS HE A
FUNGI?
>> I WOULDN'T USE THAT WORD
FUN.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU TALK
TO A GUY LIKE MAO?
BECAUSE HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DEATH OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE.
DO YOU PUT THAT ASIDE WHEN
YOU TALK TO HIM OR DO YOU
NOT BRING IT UP OR DOW
ADDRESS IT.
>> THERE WERE TWO SIDES TO
MAO.
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
DEATH OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> BUT IN HIS CONTACT WITH
AMERICANS, HIS BEHAVIOR WAS
SARCASTIC, POLITE, SPEAKING
IN A SERIOUS-- SERIES OF-- SO
HE HAD AN INTERESTING MIND.
BUT YOU, OF COURSE, ALWAYS
KNEW THAT THERE WAS THAT
OTHER SIDE.
>> Stephen: THERE WAS A
MONSTER BEHIND THE MASK.
>> THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT
OTHER SIDE.
>> Stephen: IS THERE
ANYTHING TO ADMIRE ABOUT
MAO?
>> WELL, IF YOU MEASURE IT
IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENTS, OF
UNIFYING CHINA AND GAINING
BACK SOME SELF-RESPECT, THAT
IS WHAT MANY CHINESE ADMIRED
ABOUT HIM.
WHAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I
WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IS TO
ASK WHAT IS IT WORTH.
THESE TENS OF MILLIONS OF
LIVES.
AND WE WOULD HAVE TO-- WE
WOULD SAY NO, WITHIN CHINA
THE OPINION WOULD BE DIVIDED.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE
SOMETHING WE DO ON THE SHOW
CALLED WORLD WAR UPDATE
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE WHAT
ANYBODY SAYS, THE COLD WAR
IS NOT OVER, OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO SOME OF
MY YOUNGER VIEWERS WHAT THE
COLD WAR WAS BECAUSE IT'S
HARD FOR THEM TO KNOW, THE
NER VOWSNESS OF IT.
>> WELL, THE COLD WAR WITH
RUSSIA IS SORT OF IS OVER.
BUT THE-- .
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW, I
DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THEY'RE JUST PLAYING
POSSUM, THEY'RE TRYING TO
GET US TO LOWER OUR GUARD
AND THEY LAUNCH THE MISSILE.
>> WELL, YOU AND I HAVE-- .
>> Stephen: A DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION.
>> A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
AT THAT TIME YOU KNEW THAT
IF A WAR OCCURRED, IT WOULD
BE MILLIONS OF CASUALTIES,
OR COULD BE IN A NUMBER OF
HOURS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU
COMMITTED THAT TO DOMINATE
YOU COMPLETELY, YOU'D HAVE
TO YIELD WHENEVER AN ISSUE
CAME UP.
>> Stephen: THAT SENSE OF AN
EXISTENTIAL THREAT Z IT
EXCUSE EVERYTHING ON BOTH
SIDES?
I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE
CRITICIZED OUR INTERVENTION
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.
OUR INTERVENTION IN
INDONESIA, IN SOUTH AMERICA.
WERE THOSE-- I THINK THAT
ANYTHING WAS WORTH WINNING
THE COLD WAR.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE
CRITICS?
>> WELL, I THINK IT WAS VERY
IMPORTANT TO WIN THE COLD
WAR.
BECAUSE THE ISSUE THEN WAS
WHETHER WE WOULD CONTINUE TO
HAVE A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY OR
WHETHER IT'S SORT OF STALINIST,
MATERIALISTIC, TOTALLY
PLANNED SYSTEM WOULD TAKE
OVER.
>> Stephen: LIKE OBAMA IS
SETTING UP?
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
OUTLOUD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
HAVE DINNER WITH THESE
PEOPLE BUT LET'S CALL
IT-- LET'S CALL THAT ONE.
>> I DON'T GET INVITED TO
DIN THEIR OFTEN WITH OBAMA.
>> Stephen: I NEVER GET
INVITED.
TAKE ME WITH YOU THE NEXT
TIME YOU GO.
DR. KISSINGER, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE BOOK IS "ON
CHINA"
THE MAN IS HENRY KISSINGER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
