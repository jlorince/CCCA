[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HERE TO TELL ME HOW WE CAN BEST
HELP ISIS DEFEAT THEMSELVES ISTHE MANAGING EDITOR OF THE IRAQ
OIL REPORT BEN VAN HEUVELEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BEN.
ALL RIGHT, BEN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HOW BAD IS THIS SITUATION OVER
THERE?
SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED THATLEBANON IS NOW THE STABLE MIDDLE
EASTERN COUNTRY?
[LAUGHTER]>> IT'S VERY BAD.
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
OKAY.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
CAN WE JUST IGNORE IT?
DO WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TOIT?
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLEDIDN'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO
IRAQ WHEN WE STILL HAD TROOPSTHERE.
WHY SHOULD WE PAY ATTENTION NOW?
>> I THINK ONE OF THE BESTREASONS TO PAY ATTENTION IS THAT
THESE AREAS IN NORTHERN IRAQ NOWTHAT ISIS IS CONTROLLING, I
THINK IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE TODRAW ANALOGY BETWEEN WHAT
ISIS WANTS DO THERE AND WHAT THETALIBAN DID IN AFGHANISTAN PRIOR
TO 2001.
SO IN AS MUCH AS IT'S A BIGTHREAT TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE
WORLD TO HAVE A GROUP LIKE ISISCONTROLLING LARGE TERRITORY AND
MARSHALING A LOT OF RESOURCES,IT'S A THREAT TO EVERYBODY.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE OIL?
[LAUGHTER]IS THE OIL OKAY?
[LAUGHTER]ARE THEY BEING CRUEL TO THE OIL
UP THERE?
>> I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE OILIS ACTUALLY SAFE RIGHT NOW.
MOST OF IRAQ'S OIL PRODUCTION ISIN THE SOUTH, WHICH IS SHIA
MAJORITY.
AND ISIS IS A RADICAL SUNNIGROUP, AND THEY'RE MORE IN THE
NORTH.
SO THE OIL PRODUCTION IS NOTAFFECTED SO FAR.
>> Stephen: CAN'T WE SIT BACK,LIKE YOU DUMP A BUNCH OF RED
ANTS AND A BUNCH OF BLACK ANTSIN A PILE, AND YOU POUR A LITTLE
HONEY IN THE MIDDLE, AND YOUJUST MAKE THEM FIGHT.
CAN'T WE JUST DO THAT?
WHY DO WE HAVE TO STICK OUR BIGTOE BACK IN THERE?
[LAUGHTER]>> WELL, I THINK IF WE DON'T
STICK OUR BIG TOE BACK IN THEREAT LEAST IN TERMS OF INTERVENING
DIPLOMATICALLY AT THE VERY LEASTTO AFFECT SOME POLITICAL CHANGE
IN IRAQ, THEN THAT'S EXACTLYWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT'S GOING TO BE A TERRIBLEHUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE WITH
MILITIAS AND...
>> Stephen: HUMANITARIAN, BUTIT'S HUMANI-THEM-IAN, YOU KNOW?
DON'T THEY HAVE IT COMING?
DO YOU KNOW THE NAMES WE'VE HADTO MEMORIZE OVER HERE WITH
THOSE PEOPLE? ALL THE ALS, BINS,AND ABDULS AND ALL THAT STUFF.
I DON'T HAVE ANY ROOM.
I DELETED THOSE NAMES AND FILLEDIT WITH PEOPLE FROM THE UKRAINE
I CAN'T PAY ATTENTION TO ITANYMORE.
HAVEN'T WE PAID OUR PRICE?
[APPLAUSE]HOW BAD, THIS GUY, THIS
AL-BAGHDADI GUY, HE'S WILLING TOGO FURTHER THAN
ANYBODY ELSE IS MYUNDERSTANDING.
THAT'S WHY HE MAY NOT HAVEENJOYED THE SUPPORT ON THE
STREET WITH SUNNIS.
HOW BAD IS THIS CAT?
>> HE'S A REALLY, TRULY,HORRIBLE, EVIL PERSON.
JUST YESTERDAY THERE WEREREPORTS STILL UNCONFIRMED BUT
CREDIBLE THAT HE ORDERED THEEXECUTION OF THOUSANDS OF
CAPTURED IRAQI TROOPS.
SO HE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON.
>> Stephen: IS HE THE KEYSERSOZE OF THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> THAT MIGHT BE FAIR TO SAY.
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR
ALL THE CHEERFUL NEWS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BEN VAN HEUVELEN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THE IRAQ OIL REPORT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
