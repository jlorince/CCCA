HIDDEN REALITY.
WHAT THE HELL DOES LOVE HAVETO DO WITH MATH BECAUSE
SPOILER ALERT, I HATED MATH AND I WILL TELL YOU
WHY, BECAUSE MATH DOESN'TCARE ABOUT MY OPINION.
WHY SHOULD I LOVE IT.
>> WELL, THANK YOU FORSAYING THAT, STEPHEN.
BECAUSE I HEAR IT QUITEOFTEN.
EVEN FROM SUPERSMART ANDSUPERINTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO
WOULD NEVER SAY I HATE ART.
OR I HATE MUSIC.
>> Stephen: I HATE SOME ART,SOME MUSIC.
>> BUT IT'S OKAY IN OURSOCIETY TO SAY I HATE MATH.
>> Stephen: SO MATH IS LIKEART TO YOU.
>> MATH IS LIKE ART.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THATWHEN YOU SAY I HATE MATH,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
>> Stephen: WHOSE FAULT ISBECAUSE I LOVE BLAMING
PEOPLE FOR THINGS.
>> IT'S MY FAULT.
>> Stephen: YOUR FAULT.
>> I SHOULD HAVE WRITTENTHIS BOOK A LONG TIME AGO.
>> Stephen: SO IF I READTHIS I WILL LOVE MATH.
>> I HOPE SO.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY I HATE MATH,WHAT YOU REALLY SAYING IS I
HATE THE WAY MATHEMATICS WASTAUGHT TO ME.
IMAGINE IN ART CLASS.
IN WHICH THEY TEACH YOU ONLYHOW TO PAINT A FENCE OR A
WALL BUT NEVER SHOW YOU THEPAINTINGS OF THE GREAT
MASTERS.
THEN OF COURSE YEARS LATERYOU WILL SAY I HATE ART.
WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY BESAYING IS I HATE PAINTING A
FENCE.
AND SO IT IS WITH MATH.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY I HATE MATH,WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING
IS I HATE PAINTING A FENCE.
>> Stephen: BUT IN MATHDON'T I HAVE TO KNOW A FAIR
AMOUNT OF HIGH END MATH TOAPPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE
MASTERS.
IT'S ALMOST AS IF, YOU KNOW,YES, YOU COULD SHOW ME A
PAINTING BY A MASTER, BUT IDON'T HAVE EYEBALLS YET.
DON'T YOU NEED TO SORT OFGROW THE MATH EYEBALLS TO
SEE THE EQUATIONS ASBEAUTIFUL?
>> THAT'S OUR JOB.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY TEACHERSA GREAT TEACHER WOULD SAY-- USED
TO SAY, YOU KNOW F YOU ASK ADRUNKARD WHICH NUMBER IS BIG
TWO, TWO-THIRDS OR THREEFIFTHS HE WON'T TELL YOU,
BUT IF YOU ASK HIM WHAT ISBETTER, TWO BOTTLE OF VODKA
FOR -- HE WILL TELL YOURIGHT A WAP.
TWO BOTTLES.
COURSE.
SO I TRY TO-- .
>> Stephen: THAT IS A LEVELOF MATH THAT PERHAPS ONLY
RUSSIANS CAN DO.
(APPLAUSE)>> TRUE.
I COME FROM RUSSIA.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
>> Stephen: FROM RUSSIA WITHLOVE.
>> AN MATH.
>> Stephen: NOW IN RUSSIA,IS MATH THE SAME AS IT IS

>> Stephen: YES, YOU MIGHTHAVE TO GO BACK.
I UNDERSTAND-- UNDERSTAND.
OKAY.
YOU NOT ONLY SOMEONE WHOWRITES PASSIONATELY, YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE PERFORMEDPASSIONATELY.
YOU DID A THE RIGHT OF LOVEAND MATH, AN EROTIC
JOURNEY INTO THE BEAUTY OFNUMBERS AND THE HUMAN FORM.
WHICH FEATURES YOU NAKED ANDWITH EQUATIONS ON THE BODY
OF YOUR LOVER.
ISN'T THAT A LITTLECONSERVATIVE FOR A PROFESSOR
AT BERKELEY.
>> WHAT WOULDN'T I DO TOEXPOSE THE BEAUTY OF
MATHEMATICS.
>> Stephen: LET'S SHOW THEPEOPLE YOU WHAT DID
>> Stephen: LET'S SHOW THEPEOPLE YOU WHAT DID
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: I MIGHT HAVE HIT
THE BOOKS A LITTLE BITHARDER AS A CHILD AM NOW IS
THAT FOR GENERAL AUDIENCES,CAN KIDS WATCH THIS.
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TOGET TEENAGERS HOOKED ON
MATH.
>> WELL, IF THE FILM MAKESVIEWERS WANT TO EMBRACE
MATHEMATICS, SO BE IT.
>> Stephen: WHAT WERE YOUWRITING ON THAT POOR WOMAN'S
STOMACH.
WHAT IS THAT EQUATION THERE?
>> WELL, IN THE FILM, SHEREPRESENTS MATHEMATICS
>> Stephen: SHE'S MATH? I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
>> THE FILM IS ABOUT A LOVEAFFAIR THAT IS US DOING
MATHEMATICS, IT IS A LOVEAFFAIR.
AND SHE REPRESENTS THE TRUTHIN MATHEMATICS WHICH IS WE
SACRIFICE OURSELVES.
AND THE PREMISE OF THE FILMIS THAT THE MATHEMATICIAN
FOUND THE FORMULA OF LOVE.
THE FORMULA SO POWERFUL THANHE REALIZED THAT HE REALIZED
THIS COULD BE USED NOT ONLYFOR GOOD BUT ALSO FOR ILL.
SO THEN HE UNDERSTANDS THATHE HAS TO PROTECT THE
FORMULA.
HE HAS TO HIDE IT.
FROM THE POWERS THAT BE WHOCOULD MISUSE IT.
COULD MISUSE THE FORMULA ANDTHAT'S WHY HE DECIDES TO
TATTOO IT ON THE BODY OF THEWOMAN HE LOVES.
>> Stephen: AND THEN, ANDTHEN WHAT HAPPENS TO HER?
DO THE BAD GUYS CHASE HERAND --
>> YOU HAVE TO SEE THE FILM.
>> Stephen: I SAW SOME OF IT.
I SAW-- I CAN'T ACTUALLYSHOW THE PEOPLE BECAUSE ITS
GOT YOUR NAKED BUTT IN IT.
DO ALL MATHEMATICIANS HAVEAN ASS THAT HIGH AND TIGHT?
>> THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
>> Stephen: I NEVER DID MATHAND THE RESULTS WERE
DISASTROUS.
