(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYONE.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
SIT DOWN.
THANK YOU, CITIZENS ALL,
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,
FOLKS.
AS YOU KNOW, I AM A HUGE
SUPPORTER OF REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE RICK PERRY SPELLED
WITH AN A.
HE IS A WINNER SPELLED WITH
A G FOR AWESOME.
NOW UNFORTUNATELY HIS NAME
IS BEING SULLIED BY RICK
PERRY WITH AN "E"
"THE WASHINGTON POST"
REPORTS THAT THE RICK PERRY
FAMILY HUNTING CAMP ONCE HAD
A RACIALLY CHARGED NAME.
IT IS A HUNTING CAMP WAS
EVIDENTLY CALLED-- OKAY--
(LAUGHTER)
HOW DO I PUT THIS.
OKAY, OKAY,--
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT
SAYS-- SOMEBODY HELP ME OUT
HERE.
>> I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
REFRAINING FROM SAYING THAT
WORD SO I'M GOING TO SAY
WHAT THE WORD WAS ON THE
ROCK.
THE NAME OF THE PLATES WAS
CALLED NIGGERHEAD.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
OF COURSE HERMAN CAIN CAN
GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE
IT'S OKAY FOR BLACK PEOPLE
TO CALL EACH OTHER'S FAMILY
HUNTING CAMP THAT.
AND FOLKS, THIS IS TROUBLE
FOR PERRY.
BUT I SAY THIS CONTROVERSY
OVER CAMP-- UM --
>> NIGGERHEAD--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES, I SAY IT IS
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE
VACATIONED AT QUESTIONABLY
NAMED RESORTS.
FOR INSTANCE FOR INSTANCE,
CHESTER A ARTHUR SPENT ALL
HIS SUMMERS AT THIEVING
CHINAAMAN SPRINGS.
AND RICHARD NIXON USED TO GO
FLY-FISHING AT JEWS CONTROL
THE MEDIA CREEK.
EVEN BARACK OBAMA SPENTS A
LOT OF TIME AT CAMP DAVID
WHICH UNTIL RECENTLY ONLY
ADMITTED WHITE PRESIDENTS.
NOW--
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, LET'S BE FAIR.
NOW PERRY SAYS THEY CHANGED
THE NAME A LONG TIME AGO BUT
I SAY WHO CARES.
I AM SURE THE ORIGINAL
MEANING OF --
>> NIGGERHEAD-- .
>> Stephen: YES, THAT WORD,
WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT.
AS A COMMENTER ON THE
CONSERVATIVE BLOG RED STATE
POINTED OUT THE WORD IN
QUESTION IS A TECHNICAL
TERM.
MEANING MANY THINGS SUCH AS
THE STRIKING WEIGHT ON A
PILE DRIVER AND ISOLATED
CORAL HEAD NOTORIOUS AS A
NAVIGATION HAZARD OR A BLACK
IRON POST FOR MOORING SHIPS.
SEE T JUST MEANT ANYTHING
THAT WAS DARK AND BOTHERSOME
THAT YOU WOULD POUND ON THE
HEAD OR TIE A ROPE AROUND.
NOTHING OFFENSIVE ABOUT IT
