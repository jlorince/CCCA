REAL NAME.
SO THIS IS A DIFFICULT
DECISION.
I'VE TALKED IT OVER WITH MY
SPIRITUAL ADVERTISER, I'VE
TALKED WITH OVER WITH MY
MONEY.
BUT I HAVEN'T YET TALKED IT
OVER WITH MY MONEY'S
SPIRITUAL ADVISOR.
PLEASE WELCOME FORMER FEC
CHAIR GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE
2080 McCAIN CAMPAIGN AND MY
PERSONAL LAWYER, MR. TREVOR
POTTER.
TREVOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME TONIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)
TREVOR, TREVOR, YOU SEE
THESE SHOES?
YOU SEE THOSE?
PRETTY GOOD.
TREVOR, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
CAN I RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND
KEEP MY SUPERPAC?
DON'T SUGARCOAT IT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THAT'S A
LITTLE LESS SUGAR THAN I WAS
HOPING FOR.
WHY?
>> YOU CANNOT BE A CANDIDATE
AND RUN A SUPERPAC.
THAT WOULD BE COORDINATING
WITH YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
AND I WOULD GO BLIND.
BUT HERE'S THE THING, I LOVE
MY SUPERPAC.
AND I LOVE THE MONEY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK HERE THIS
IS HOW MUCH I HAVE RAISED.
>> THAT IS SHOCKING.
>> Stephen: ISN'T IT.
>> BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE THE
PAC.
YOU COULD HAVE IT RUN BY
SOMEBODY ELSE.
>> Stephen: WAIT, WHAT, WAIT,
WHAT?
SOMEONE ELSE CAN TAKE IT
OVER.
>> YES.
BUT SOMEONE WHO YOU WOULD
NOT BE COORDINATING WITH IN
TERMS OF PAC ADS AND
STRATEGY.
>> Stephen: OH, TREVOR, I
WOULDN'T WANT TO EVEN CREATE
THE APPEARANCE OF ELECTORAL
SKULDUGGERY IF THAT IS A
WORD I CAN SAY ON A FAMILY
SHOW.
BUT I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A
GUY, JON?
JON STEWART, EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON STEWART.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
TREVOR, JON, JON, TREVOR.
THANK YOU.
JON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
BEING HERE, JON, LET ME ASK
YOU, ARE YOU HERE TO OFFER
TO TAKE OVER COLBERT
SUPERPAC.
>> Jon: I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO DIMINISH-- I WON'T OFFER,
I'M HONORED.
I WOULD BE HONORED, BUT I
CAN-- IF I MAY.
CAN WE DO THIS, BECAUSE YOU
AND I ARE ALSO BUSINESS
PARTNERS.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> Jon: WE'RE ABOUT TO OPEN
UP THAT COMBINATION BAGEL
SHOP.
>> Stephen: AND TRAVEL
AGENCY.
>> Jon: YES, FROM SHMEAR TO
ETERNITY.
SO I DON'T KNOW-- .
>> Stephen: IS THAT A
PROBLEM, TREVOR, IS BEING
BUSINESS PARTNERS A PROBLEM?
>> BEING BUSINESS PARTNERS
DOES NOT COUNT AS
COORDINATION LEGALLY.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT,
WELL-- THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> Jon: I ASSUME THERE'S
REAMS OF COMPLICATED
PAPERWORK TO BE EXECUTED
BEFORE WE TRANSFER THE
REIGNS OF POWER WITH
SOMETHING AS CRITICAL TO OUR
VERY FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY
AS A SUPERPAC.
>> Stephen: TREVOR?
>> I BROUGHT THE ONE
DOCUMENT WITH ME.
>> Stephen: GOOD MAN.
>> Jon: THAT'S EXCELLENT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT'S DOUBLE-SPACED.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> Jon: BEAUTIFUL FONT.
>> Stephen: I SIGN HERE.
>> Jon: VERY INTERESTING,
ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND THEN I
BELIEVE YOU SIGN THERE.
>> Jon: OKAY.
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT.
IS THERE ANY SENSE, BY THE
WAY, HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE
IN THIS THING BECAUSE AS THE
GUY WHO IS RUNNING IT, I
WOULD-- .
>> Stephen: THERE'S --
>>.
>> Jon: OH-- .
>> Stephen: NO, NO, LATER,
LATER.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: TREVOR, THERE
YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT, JON.
PREPARE YOURSELF.
HERE WE GO, TREVOR.
TREVOR, IF YOU WILL, COLBERT
SUPERPAC TRANSFER ACTIVATE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: COLBERTING,
COLBERT SUPERPAC IS DEAD.
>> Jon: BUT IT HAS BEEN
REBORN THE DEFINITELY NOT
COORDINATING WITH STEPHEN
COLBERT SUPERPAC!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU OKAY, JON.
>> Jon: I BELIEVE I HAVE A
PURE CASH ERECTION RIGHT
NOW.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO PUT
A BAG OF FROZEN PEAS ON
THAT.
>> Jon: I CERTAINLY WILL.
NOW THAT I HAVE THE
SUPERPAC-- CAN I RUN ADS
SUPPORTING STEPHEN COLBERT
WHO I BELIEVE IN VERY DEEPLY,
PERHAPS ATTACKING HIS
OPPONENTS WHO I DON'T
BELIEVE IN AT ALL.
>> YES, YOU CAN, AS LONG AS
YOU DO NOT COORDINATE.
>> Stephen: WELL THAT'S
INTERESTING.
>> Jon: RED FLAG.
>> Stephen: I AM BUSY.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, HAVE
A SHOW.
>> Jon: I CAN LEGALLY HIRE
STEPHEN'S CURRENT SUPERPAC
STAFF TO PRODUCE THESE ADS
THAT WILL BE IN NO WAY
COORDINATED WITH STEPHEN.
>> YES.
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE NO
KNOWLEDGE OF STEPHEN'S PLAN.
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S
EASY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M DOING.
OKAY, JON, I GUESS YOU'D
BETTER LEAVE FOR FEAR THAT
WE WOULD COORDINATE WITH
EACH OTHER.
I CANNOT LET YOU KNOW MY
PLANS.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO
KNOW.
La, La, La.
>> Stephen: FROM NOW ON I
WILL JUST HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
MY PLANS ON MY TELEVISION
SHOW AND JUST TAKE THE RISK
THAT YOU MIGHT WATCH IT.
>> Jon: I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHEN IT'S ON 11:30 MONDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY.
>> Stephen: YES, THANK YOU
SO MUCH, JON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: GENTLEMEN, I
THINK OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.
BRING IT HERE, BRING IT IN
HERE.
OKAY.
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET,
NONCOORDINATION!
JON STEWART, TREVOR POTTER,
EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
WELL, WELL, FOLKS, SOMEONE
SHOULD GET THAT MAN OUT OF
MY STUDIO.
WELL, NOW THAT THAT IS ALL
CLEARED UP, NATION, I HAVE A
MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
FOR OVER A DAY NOW THE
PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
HAVE BEEN CRYING OUT FOR
SOMEONE WHO CAN RESTORE OUR
NATION'S FORMER GREATNESS TO
ITS CURRENT PERFECTION.
WELL, AMERICA, THAT SOMEONE
IS NOW.
I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT
I AM FORMING AN EXPLORATORY
COMMITTEE TO LAY THE
GROUNDWORK FOR MY POSSIBLE
CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF
SOUTH CAROLINA!
I'M DOING IT!
DROP THEM, JIMMY.
WHOOO, WHOOO, WHOOO!
AND WITH YOUR HELP, AND
POSSIBLY THE HELP OF SOME
SORT OF OUTSIDE GROUP THAT
BY AM NOT COORDINATING WITH,
WE CAN EXPLORE TAKING THIS
COUNTRY BACK.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU ALL!
AND GOD BLESS CITIZENS
UNITED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHOOO!
