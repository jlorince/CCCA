( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
WOW.
WOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen:  LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN--
( CHEERING )
OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT
APPLAUSE.
I GOTTA SAY, MY MIND IS CLEARY
NOW.
NATION, TONIGHT IS THE
ALL-IMPORTANT FLORIDA PRIMARY.
NOW NORMALLY I DO MY SHOW LIVE,
BUT TONIGHT I PRETAPED IT AT
7:30 BECAUSE THAT IS MIDNIGHT
FOR THE AVERAGE FLORIDIAN.
( LAUGHTER )
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MITT
ROMNEY OR NEWT GINGRICH WON, BUT
WE DO KNOW ONE THING FOR
CERTAIN-- TOMORROW BOTH OF THEM
CAN GO BACK TO IGNORING LATINOS.
(  LAUGHTER  )
NOW, THE POLLS SAY THAT ROMNEY'S
GOT THIS ONE, AND HIS APPEAL IS
OBVIOUS.
YESTERDAY, HE SERENADETHE CROWD
AT ONE OF FLORIDA'S ELDERLY
STORAGE FACILITIES AND PROVED
THAT HIS MANSIONS AREN'T THE
ONLY THINGS WITH THE GOLDEN
PIPES
♪ OH, BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS
SKIES
FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN
♪ FOR PURPLE MOUNTAINS MAJESTY
ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAIN
♪ AMERICA, AMERICA  ♪ ♪.
>> Stephen:  IT'S JUST LIKE
JAZZ.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S THE NOTES YOU DON'T HIT.
BUT, FOLKS, DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF NEWT PULLS AN UPSET BECAUSE
YESTERDAY, FORMER GODFARTHER'S
PIZZA C.E.O. AND PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS,
HERMAN CAIN, MADE THIS STRONG
ENDORSEMENT.
>> DUCKY-DUCKY.
DUCKY-DUCKY.
I WISH HE WAS STILL IN THE
RACY-WACY.
( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, THE DUCK THAT HE
SHUCKED HAS SIGNED A NONDIZZ
CLOSER AGREEMENT.
BUT HERMAN SAVED THE SHUCK JEST
OF THE DUCKIES FOR HIS REAL
ENDORSEMENTS.
>> I LIKE NEWT GINGRICH FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!
>> Stephen:  YES!
CAIN ENDORSED NEWT GINGRICH.
THEN IMMEDIATELY WENT ON THE
"TODAY SHOW" TO MAKE THE
COMPELLING CASE THAT ONLY
PRESIDENT GINGRICH CAN SAVE
AMERICA.
>> ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH MITT
ROMNEY SECURING THE NOMINATION?
>> YES, I COULD BE VERY
COMFORTABLE WITH MITT ROMNEY.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, OKAY.
(  LAUGHTER  )
HE STILL LIKES NEWT BUT HE'S
COMFORTABLE WITH ROMNEY, AND
THAT'S A GREAT ENDORSEMENT RIGHT
THERE.
I'M NOT SURE EVEN ROMNEY IS
COMFORTABLE WITH ROMNEY.
(  LAUGHTER  )
AND ENDORSING BOTH MITT AND NEWT
MAKES SENSE.
IF YOU REMEMBER CAIN'S RUNNER
ENDORSEMENT FROM A WEEK AGO.
>> THE PEOPLE.
WE, THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION,
ARE STILL IN CHARGE.
THAT'S WHO I'M ENDORSING.
>> Stephen:  YES, HE IS STILL
ENDORSING "WE THE PEOPLE."
NEWT GINGRICH IS JUST THE PEOPLE
HE'S STARTING WITH.
ROMNEY WAS NEXT.
HE'LL EVENTUALLY GET TO
EVERYONE.
(  LAUGHTER  )
BUT FOR NOW, FOLKES, I AM
ENDORSING HERMAN CAIN'S
ENDORSEMENT OF NUKE.
NEWT'S MY GUY.
I HAVE SUPPORTED GINGRICH SINCE
THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS
SENTENCE.
AND I AM NOT ALONE IN MY
NEWFOUND, LONG-STANDING LOVE OF
NEWT.
I MEAN, HE'S GOT THE PACKING OF
POWER PLAYERS, LIKE FRIEND OF
THE SHOW AND CLOSER FRIEND OF
LOBBYISTES,    DURING THE
DUKESTER.
THE FORMER CALIFORNIA
REPRESENTATIVE CURRENTLY SERVING
EIGHT YEARS FOR THE LARGEST
BRIBERY SCANDAL IN CONGRESSIONAL
HISTORY.
DUKESTER SENT A LETTER TO NEWT
PLEDGING NOT ONLY HIS SUPPORT
BUT THAT OF HIS PEERS WRITING,
"I HAVE 80% OF INMATES THAT
WOULD VOTE FOR YOU."
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
YES.
THAT IS DESTINED TO BE THE
LARGEST CIGARETTES FOR VOTES
SCANDAL IN U.S. HISTORY.
(  LAUGHTER  )
NOW ANOTHER FELLOW NEWT-KETEER,
GOVERNOR SARAH PALIN, WHO TOOK A
BRIEF BREAK FROM TAKING A LONG
BREAK FROM GOVERNING ALASKA, TO
GIVE THE BEST REASON FOR BACKING
NEWT-- PURE FIGHT.
>> WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO IS
ENGAGED AND RELENTLESS AND ISN'T
AFRAID TO SHAKE IT UP, SHAKE UP
THAT ESTABLISHMENT.
SO FOR FOR NO OTHER REASON, RAGE
AGAINST THE MACHINE, VOTE FOR
NEWT.
ANNOY A LIBERAL, VOTE NEWT.
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
ANNOY A LIBERAL.
(  LAUGHTER  )
NEWT IS LIKE A FLAMING BAG OF
POOP YOU CAN VOTE FOR.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE )
SO, SO--
( CHEERING )
NEWT CAN STILL TAKE THIS ONE,
FOLKS.
UNLESS THEY COUNT THE VOTES BY
THE TIME THIS AIRS, IN WHICH
CASE I KNEW IT
