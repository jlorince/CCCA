YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN COUNT.
AND FOLKS IF YOU WANT MORE EVIDENCE THAT THE ELITE SMARTY CRAP MEDIA ARE AGAINST US, WELL, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN LAST WEEK.
WHILE I WAS CONVENIENTLY NOT ON THE AIR, NEWS HAPPENED.
OH, AND THE FREE MASONS DON'T CONTROL THE WORLD GOVERNMENT, RIGHT.
EVIDENTLY, IN RESPONSE TO AN ANTI-MUSLIM FILM, RIOTS BROKE OUT AT AMERICAN EMBASSIES WORLDWIDE, MOST
TRAGICALLY IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA, WHERE ON SEPTEMBER 11th FOUR AMERICANS INCLUDING OUR AMBASSADOR WERE KILLED.
NOW OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
BUT MY RAGE GOES STRAIGHT AT BARACK OBAMA.
YOU SEE, HIS BUDDIES IN THE PRESS ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS CRISIS ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.
WHO ON THE DAY OF THE A ATTACKS COURAGEOUSLY VOWED NOT TO CAMPAIGN ON 9/11.
>> THERE IS A TIME AND PLACE FOR THAT.
BUT THIS DAY IS NOT THAT.
>> Stephen: NO.
THAT DAY WAS NOT THAT.
(LAUGHTER) TURNS OUT, THAT NIGHT WAS THAT.
JIM.
>> GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY JUST RELEASING THIS STATEMENT.
IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST RESPONSE WAS NOT TO CONDEMN ATTACKS ON OUR DIPLOMATIC
MISSIONS BUT TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE WHO WAGED ATTACKS.
>> Stephen: HOW DARE OBAMA SYMPATHIZE WITH THE ATTACKERS.
HE SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP AGAINST THEM LIKE MITT ROMNEY DID BY ATTACKING OUR PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER) NOW IT TURNS OUT, FOLKS, WHEN ROMNEY ATTACKED HIM, OBAMA HADN'T SAID ANYTHING YET.
(LAUGHTER) MITT WAS TALKING ABOUT A BRIEF STATEMENT CONDEMNING RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY PUT OUT ON THE WEB SITE OF THE CAIRO
EMBASSY BEFORE THE ATTACKS EVER HAPPENED.
SO OF COURSE THERE CAME A BARRAGE OF ATTACKS FROM THE LIBERAL MEDIA CLEVERLY DISGUISED AS CONSERVATIVE MEDIA.
>> ROMNEY STUCK HIS FOOT IN HIS MOUTH.
HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ENOUGH TO SHUT UP.
>> I DON'T FEEL THAT MR. ROMNEY HAS BEEN DOING HIMSELF ANY FAVORS.
SOMETIMES WHEN REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN, WHEN HOT THINGS HAPPEN, COOL WORDS OR NO WORDS IS THE WAY TO GO.
>> Reporter: MATTHEW DOWD A TOP STRATEGIST FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAID IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE SARAH
PALIN IS HIS FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR.
>> Stephen: COME ON!
SARAH PALIN WOULD BE A GREAT FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR.
TO HER, ALL POLICY IS FOREIGN.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS... YES.
(APPLAUSE) AND TO ALL THOSE PANTY WASTE PUNDITS WHO SAY THAT PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS SHOULD END AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND
THAT MITT'S FOREIGN POLICY STATEMENT WAS A CASE OF PREMATURE INAUGURATION...  (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RADIO HOST AND PILLSBURY DOE DUMP RUSH LIMBAUGH HAS AN ANSWER.
>> WE'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE ONE PRESIDENT NOW AT TIMES LIKE THIS.
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ONE, UNLESS ROMNEY SPEAKS UP.
AND THAT'S THE SAD REALITY.
>> Stephen: YES.
AS FAR AS RUSH AND I ARE CONCERNED MITT ROMNEY IS OUR PRESIDENT.
AND THAT'S THE SAD REALITY.
AND IF PRESIDENT... IF PRESIDENT ROMNEY DOES NOT DEFEND AMERICA NOW, HE WILL NOT DESERVE TO HAVE BEEN
ELECTED TWO MONTHS LATER.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IN TIMES LIKE THESE, IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
WHICH MITT PROVED AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE ON WEDNESDAY.
>> I THINK IT'S... A... A TERRIBLE COURSE TO... FOR AMERICA, TO STAND AND APOLOGY FOR OUR VALUES.
>> Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT, WE MUST NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR OUR VALUES.
IN THIS CASE OUR SACRED BELIEF IN OFFENDING OTHER PEOPLE'S SACRED BELIEFS.
JIM?
>> WHAT INFLAMED THE MAD PASSION OF MOBS AND PROTESTORS IN THE STREET?
A MOVIE.
AND INCREDIBLY AMATEURISH, CRUDE AND NASTY MOVIE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES AND RELEASED ON YOUTUBE,
INNOCENCE OF MUSLIMS, IT'S CALLED.
AND IT DEPICTS THE PROPHET MOHAMMAD AS A DOPE, A FRAUD, A PEDOPHILER AND WOMANIZER.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SORRY, MUST HAVE SLIPPED.
NOW FOLKS, I MAY NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THIS FILL AM SAYS, BUT I WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR ITS RIGHT TO SAY IT.
OBVIOUSLY MINUS THE I FEITH AND DEATH PART.
AND FOLKS, I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO PLAY THE FILM OUT OF SENSITIVITY TO ME STILL LIVING.
BUT LET ME TRY TO CALM THE GLOBAL SITUATION.
MUSLIM VIEWERS, I HAVE VIEWED THE VIDEO ON YOUTUBE.
IT COMBINES THE PRODUCTION VALUES OF A BASEMENT PORNO, THE ACTING TALENT OF AN 18 CENTURY SYPHILIS SANATORIUM
AND A SCRIPT TRANSCRIBED FROM ARGUMENTS OVERHEARD IN A BUS STATION BATHROOM.
NOT GOOD.
BUT YOU SEE, OUR CONSTITUTION MEANS WE CAN'T STOP PEOPLE FROM MAKING MOVIES THAT ARE STUPID OR GROSSLY OFFENSIVE.
FOR INSTANCE, WE MADE THREE TRANSFORMERS.
WHERE WERE THE MOBS THEN?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHERE WERE THE RIOTS?
HOWEVER HORRIBLE THIS MOVIE MAY BE, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT NEEDS TO KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO OUR VALUES,
THERE CAN BE NO APOLOGY.
I MEAN MITT ROMNEY WROTE THE BOOK ON THAT, IN HIS BOOK "NO APOLOGY" SO TO ALL THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA OUT THERE SAYING THAT
THIS FOREIGN POLICY MISSTEP IS A FATAL BLOW TO THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN, LET ME OFFER YOU A NO APOLOGY CONDOLENCE CARD.
ROMNEY 2012, I'M NOT SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
(APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
