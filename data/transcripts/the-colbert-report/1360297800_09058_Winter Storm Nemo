HOW IS IT GOING?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHAT HAVE I GOT HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, ALL RIGHT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
WE ARE BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES HERE AT THE REPORT.
I JUST WANT TO GET ALL MY EQUIPMENT READY.
I URGE -- I URGE ALL OF YOU TO DO THE SAME -- OKAY --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO PREPARE IF YOU ARE ANYWHERE FROM MAINE TO NORTH DAKOTA TO SOUTH OHIO
BECAUSE THE LARGEST BLIZZARD IN DECADES IS POISED TO SWALLOW THE NORTHEAST.
>> MASSIVE SNOWFALL, POWERFUL WIND GUSTS, A MAJOR BLIZZARD IS ABOUT TO HIT THE NORTHEAST.
>> A HISTORIC BLIZZARD COULD DUMP UP TO 30 INCHES OF SNOW.
>> THERE ARE GOING TO BE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STUCK ON THE HIGHWAYS.
>> TRAVEL COULD BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
SO PLEASE STAY OFF THE ROADS UNLESS YOU HAVE SNOW TIRES, SNOW CHAINS OR ONE OF THESE THINGS.
[LAUGHTER]
BONUS, IF YOU GET STRANDED, YOU CAN CUT IT OPEN AND CRAWL INSIDE.
[LAUGHTER]
CAN'T DO THAT WITH A PRIUS.
[LAUGHTER]
WORST HIT WILL BE BOSTON WHICH IS EXPECTING FIVE FOOT SNOW DRIFTS.
MY GOD.
IF THAT HAPPENS TO NEW YORK, WE WON'T FIND OUR MAYOR 'TIL SPRING.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW THIS YEAR THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS NAMING ALL THE WINTER STORMS LIKE HURRICANES, MAKING
THIS-- WINTER STORM NEMO.
YES, NEMO.
SO IF YOU GET SNOWED IN WITH SOME YOUNG KIDS, JUST PUT ON A DVD OF THE INCREDIBLES.
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.
[LAUGHTER]
VERY IMPORTANT, DON'T WAIT 'TIL NEMO HITS.
BE PROACTIVE.
TONIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO SALT YOUR DRIVEWAY, THEN SALT YOUR MEATS, AND THEN SALT YOUR
LOVED ONES, BECAUSE IF IT'S AS BAD AS THEY SAY, THEY MAY SOON BE YOUR MEATS.
[LAUGHTER]
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GO INTO WORK TOMORROW, IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW I'M NOT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, MY STAFF IS,
