>> Stephen: SO CLEARLY,
CLEARLY RADIOHEAD WANTS NOTHING
TO DO WITH CORPORATIONS.
I JUST WISH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
REGULATORS FELT THE SAME WAY.
JIM?
>> THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO
DO ON DAY ONE IS ISSUE AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYING ALL THE
REGULATIONS PUT IN PLACE BY
BARACK OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION
ARE PUT ON HOLD AN WE'RE GETTING
RID OF THE ONES THAT KILL JOBS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO STOP THE
E.P.A. FROM GOING FORWARD WITH
ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS THEY'VE
GOT.
>> STOP DAMAGING THE ECONOMY
WITH JOB-KILLING REGULATIONS.
>> THERE IS NO OTHER AGENCY LIKE
THE E.P.A.
IT SHOULD REALLY BE RENAMED THE
JOB KILLING ORGANIZATION OF
AMERICA.
>> Stephen: YES, GOVERNMENT
REGULATORS LIKE THE E.P.A. ARE
KILLING GOOD JOBS, LIKE PELICAN
SCRUBBER OR NEXT-OF-KIN CALLER.
FORTUNATELY SOME BRAVE
CORPORATIONS HAVE FOUND A WAY TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BIG
GOVERNMENT TELLING THEM WHAT TO
DO, AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S "WORD."
I THINK, THEREFORE I BRAND.
NATION, THESE DAYS NO COMPANY IS
TAKING MORE FLACK THAN GOOGLE.
LAST WEEK GOOGLE WAS PUBLICLY
ACCUSED BY PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE AND CURSED DOLL COME
TO LIFE RICK SANTORUM OF BIAS IN
THEIR SEARCH RESULTS.
EIGHT YEARS AGO SANTORUM
REASONABLY COMPARED GAY SEX TO
"MAN-ON-DOG."
SO GAY ADVICE COLUMNIST DAN
SAVIDGE SUCCESSFULLY LED A
CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THE TOP GOOGLE
SEARCH FOR SANTORUM A FILTHY,
JUVENILE PHRASE I'M NOT GOING TO
SAY BECAUSE THIS IS FAMILY SHOW.
LET'S JUST SAY IT RHYMES WITH
FROTHY MIX OF LUBE AND FAECAL
MATTER THAT IS SOMETIMES THE
BY-PRODUCT OF ANAL SEX.
NOW, PERSONALLY, FOLKS, I FEEL
TERRIBLE FOR RICK.
HIS NAME HAS BEEN DRAGGED
THROUGH THE MUD.
GOD, I HOPE THAT'S MUD.
[LAUGHTER]
AND RICK CLAIMS THAT IF
SOMETHING WAS UP THERE LIKE THAT
ABOUT JOE BIDEN, GOOGLE WOULD
GET RID OF IT.
THAT IS TRUE.
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND
ANYTHING EMBARRASSING ABOUT JOE
BIDEN ON THE INTERNET.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, SANTORUM ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
ACCUSING GOOGLE OF BIAS IN HOW
SEARCH RESULTS ARE DISPLAYED.
LAST WEEK GOOGLE C.E.O. ERIC
SCHMID WAS DRAGGED BEFORE AN
ANTITRUST REGULATORY PANEL TO
RESPOND TO ALLEGATIONS THAT
GOOGLE UNFAIRLY PUT THEIR OWN
SERVICES LIKE GOOGLE FLIGHT AND
GOOGLE PLACES AT THE TOP OF
THEIR SEARCH RESULTS AHEAD OF
COMPETITORS LIKE EXPEDIA.
BUT FOLKS, GOOGLE HAS THE
PERFECT ANSWER TO REGULAR --
REGULATORS.
A LEADING SEARCH ENGINEER
POINTED OUT, "OUR WEB SEARCH
RESULTS ARE PROTECTED SPEECH IF
THE FIRST AMENDMENT SENSE."
YES, WEB SEARCHES ARE ENSHRINED
IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS.
WE HAVE THE RIGHT THE LIFE,
LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF
HACKED SCARLETT JOHANSSON NEWS
PICS, AND GOOGLE IS NOT THE ONLY
COMPANY DEMANDING THEIR FIRM
RIGHTS.
>> TOBACCO COMPANIES ARE SUING
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER A
PLAN TO PUT GRAPHIC PHOTOS ON
CIGARETTE PACKS, CLAIMING THE
MANDATORY LABELS VIOLATE THEIR
FREE SPEECH RIGHTS.
>> THEY SAY THE REQUIREMENT IS A
VIOLATION OF THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.
>> Stephen: YES, CIGARETTES
HAVE A FIRM RIGHT TO BE ALIVE
WITH PLEASURE AS WRITTEN IN THE
CONSTITUTION BY THE FATHERS,
JAMES MADISON, THOMAS JEFFERSON
AND JOSEPH CAMEL.
[LAUGHTER]
REGULATING A CIGARETTE TAX'S
ABILITY TO ENTICE ME TO BUY IT
IS A VIOLATION OF ITS FREE
SPEECH.
I MAY NOT AGREE WITH WHAT A
CARTON OF SMOKES SAYS, BUT I
WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR ITS
RIGHT TO SAY IT.
AND WE ALL KNOW... WE ALL KNOW
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
PROTECTED BY THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.
FINALLY THEIR PRODUCTS ARE
PROTECTED, TOO.
IT IS A MAJOR MILESTONE IN
CORPORATE CIVIL RIGHTS.
AND REMEMBER, THE FIRST
AMENDMENT PROTECTS NOT ONLY
SPEECH YOU LIKE BUT SPEECH YOU
DON'T LIKE.
THEREFORE GOVERNMENT REGULATORS
MUST NOT PERSECUTE PRODUCTS JUST
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FIT SOME
BUREAUCRATS' NARROW DEFINITION
OF FIREPROOF OR POTABLE.
I SAY...
[LAUGHTER]
I SAY THAT SPEECH IS ALWAYS
SPEECH, AND IT IS TIME WE
FINALLY LET THESE PRODUCT
AMERICANS BE HEARD, STARTING
WITH MY PERSONAL PHYSICIAN
DR. MARVIN PEPPER.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME,
DOCTOR.
AS ALWAYS, I'LL GIVE YOU THE
LAST WORD.
OH, WHAT A REFRESHING POINT OF
VIEW.
AND THAT'S "THE WORD."
