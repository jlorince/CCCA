THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

>> Stephen: FOLKS, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU HERE, UP THERE, I
WANT TO SAY I HAD TO ANY
HALF -- THIEVES WHO ARE
JOINING US TONIGHT.
HOPE ALL YOUR ATTACKS ARE
PLUS TWO.
NATION, TONIGHT YOU ARE
WITNESSING HISTORY SO I HOPE
YOU ALL REMEMBER WHERE ARE
YOU RIGHT NOW.
FOR ME, I'M RIGHT HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
WRITE THAT DOWN SO I DON'T
FORGET.
BECAUSE I JUST FLEW BACK
FROM WASHINGTON, AND BOY, IS
MY EVERYTHING TIRED.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE TODAY I CHANGED THE
COURSE OF AMERICA, APPEARING
BEFORE THE FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION TO CONVINCE THEM
TO LET ME FORM COLBERT
SUPERPAC.
THE KEY ISSUE, FOLKS, WOULD
TALKING ABOUT MY PAC ON THE
AIR CONSTITUTE AN IN-KIND
DONATION FROM VIACOM FORCING
VIACOM TO REPORT SENSITIVE
FINANCIAL SECRETS.
FOR INSTANCE, THAT VH1
ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET IS
$14.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THOSE BON JOVI
VIDEOS AREN'T GOING TO PAY
FOR THEMSELVES.
NOW FOLKS, WE'VE ALL WAITED
TWO MONTHS FOR THIS
DECISION.
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO
TODAY'S EXPLOSIVE COMMITTEE
ROOM ACTION.
JIM?
>> THE FIRST ITEM IS AN A
ADVISORY OPINION REQUEST
SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF
STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> BY CONTRAST, B AND C
CONCLUDE THAT COST
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE -- AB
AND C, REACH THE SAME
CONCLUSIONS ON THE FOLLOWING
ISSUES.
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.
>> EARLIER -- SET FORTH IN
AGENDA DOCUMENT 11-38
QUESTION ONE.
>> THE CERTAIN SOMETHING --
DO NOT HAVE TO BE REQUIRED.
AND BUT IF YOU DO, THEN --
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IF ONLY, IF ONLY
THERE HAD BEEN MORE ARCANE
BUREAUCRATIC JARGON WE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON C-SPAN
3.
OF COURSE, I WAS THERE TO
GET MY RIGHTS BY ANY MEANS
NECESSARY.
AND I LET THOSE
COMMISSIONERS HAVE IT WITH
BOTH BARRELS.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> YES.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OH YEAH.
OH YEAH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YEAH.
I WENT THERE.
I POPPED THE YOU'RE WELCOME
IN THERE.
OF COURSE IT WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT MOMENT OF MY
POLITICAL CAREER.
SO I TOOK EXHAUSTIVE NOTES.
(LAUGHTER)
FINALLY AFTER ALL THE
DELIBERATION IT WAS TIME FOR
THE COMMISSION TO VOTE.
>> I MOVE TO APPROVE AGENDA
DOCUMENT 11-38 WHICH IS
DRAFT A.
ALL IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
>> AYE.
>> OPPOSED.
COMMISSION CARRIES 5-1.
Mr. COLBERT YOU MAY FORM
YOUR PAC AND PROCEED AS THE
COMMISSION HAS ADVISED IN
THIS OPINION.
>> Stephen: WHOO!
I CAN HAVE SUPERPAC!
WHOO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: COME ON!
YEAH, BAB BABY.
NOW I REALIZE THAT SOME OF
THESE BALLOONS LOOK A LITTLE
RIPE.
THAT'S BECAUSE WE PUT THEM
UP THERE 60 DAYS AGO WHEN WE
FIRST FILED FOR THE ADVISORY
OPINION ALONG WITH A FLOCK
OF FREE SPEECH DOVES.
