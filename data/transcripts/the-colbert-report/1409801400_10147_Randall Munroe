RANDALL MUNROE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HEY, MR. MUNROE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHOMAY NOT KNOW MR. MUNROE HERE,
YOU ARE THE HUGO AWARD-WINNINGCREATOR OF XKCD
OKAY.
THAT IS A-- ALL THE HIP KIDSKNOW IT'S A STICK-FIGURE COMIC
STRIP READ BY MILLIONS OFPEOPLE EVERY WEEK.
LET'S SETTLE THE FIRSTTHING.
WHY IS IT CALLED XKCD
>> I KEPT PICKING DIFFERENTNAMES BASED ON WHAT I WAS
INTERESTED IN THINGS TO SETUP AN INTERNET ACCOUNT.
I GOT TIRED OF BEINGSKYWALKER 4 AND EVENTUALLY
WANTED TO PICK SOMETHINGTHAT HAD NO MEANING AT ALL
SO I WOULDN'T GET TIRED OFIT.
>> Stephen: BUT NOW IT MEANSYOU.
NOW XKCD MEANS YOU.
>> YEAH, I SORT OF RUINEDTHAT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: OKAY.
THE STYLE OF YOUR STRIP ISONE OF THE SAME TIME VERY
BASIC BUT ALSO VERY UNIQUE.
LET'S SHOW THEM EXAMPLE OFYOUR SELF PORTRAIT.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT.
WHAT, WHY?
>> IS THIS THE BEST YOU CANDRAW OR DO YOU JUST NOT WANT
TO WASTE TIME ON IT?
>> DRAWING IS REALLY HARD.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND BUT YOU HAVECHOSEN TO DO IT FOR A
LIVING.
NOW YOU DO EXTRAORDINARYTHINGS WITH THIS STRIP.
AND YOU HAVE TAKEN THATEXTRAORDINARY THING AND MADE
IT INTO A BOOK NOW.
IT'S CALLED WHAT IF SERIOUSSCIENTIFIC ANSWERS TO ABSURD
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS THE SORT OF THINGYOU WILL SOMETIMES DO IN THE
STRIP.
YOU WILL EXPLAIN SOMETHINGCOMPLICATED WITH YOUR
DRAWINGS.
AND IN THE SIMPLIST POSSIBLESCIENTIFIC MATHEMATICAL OR
PHILOSOPHICAL WAY.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGSYOU'RE TRYING TO EXPLAIN IN
THIS BOOK?
>> ONE OF THE FIRSTQUESTIONS PEOPLE ASK IS WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TRY TOHIT A BASEBALL PITCHED AT
90% OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT.
>> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
>> A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENS.
IT HAPPENS REALLY QUICKLY.
AND NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GETOUT ALIVE.
>> Stephen: LIKE THERE'S AFIREBALL THAT INCINERATES
THE PITCHER, RIGHT.
>> YEAH, THE BALL FUSES WITHTHE AIR IN FRONT OF IT.
AND YOU GET A SHELL OFX-RAYS THAT SWEEPS OUT AND
IT STARTS DISINTEGRATING THEBATTER AND THE CATCHER AND
ALSO THE PITCHER.
THE PITCHER IS THE FIRST TOGO.
AND A LOT OF THE EXAMPLESYOU HAVE IN THIS BOOKS END
UP WITH PEOPLE, PLACES ORPLANETS BEING DESTROYED.
WHY DO THOSE, WHY ARE THOSETHE KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT
APPEAL TO YOU MOST?
>> I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE TO ASKQUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE
THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE.
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE SPENT ALOT OF TIME MILLIONS OF
HOURS COLLECTIVELY WATCHINGGIFS OF PEOPLE WALKING INTO
SCREEN DOORS AND FALLING OFFOF THINGS.
SO IT SEEMS LIKE NOT ASURPRISE THAT PEOPLE WOULD
WANT TO SEE AN ENTIRE PLANETCRASH INTO SOMETHING OR BLOW
UP.
>> WE ACTUALLY HIT YOU WITH ACOUPLE QUESTIONS BEFOREHAND
HERE.
I WONDER IF YOU HAVE HAD AMOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THESE.
TAKE A STAB.
THESE ARE SOME THAT WE POSEDTO YOU BEFORE YOU CAME HERE
TONIGHT.
HOW MUCH DOES CANADA WEIGH?
(LAUGHTER)
>> SO AND WE'RE TALKING ALLTHE WAY DOWN TO THE CORE OR
JUST-- .
>> Stephen: JUST THE CANADAPART.
>> JUST THE SURFACE PART.
>> Stephen: INHABITABLEMANTLE.
>> IF YOU TAKE A SLICETHAT'S THE WHOLE THING, IT
WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE 10TO THE 23rd KILOGRAM.
THE WHOLE RERT IS SOMETHINGTO THE 24th.
>> Stephen: I WAS VERYCLOSE.
I HAD 10 TO THE 22nd.
>> YEAH, BUT-- .
>> Stephen: RIGHT THERE,OKAY.
>> BUT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT,THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN TOEDUCATE US.
BUT COULD YOU INCIDENTALLYTHROUGH HUMOR AND THROUGH
YOUR DRAWING, COULD YOUINCIDENTALLY EDUCATE LIKE
KIDS ABOUT SCIENCE ANDMATH?
>> YEAH, WELL THAT'SACTUALLY HOW I GOT STARTED
DOING THIS WAS I TAUGHT ACLASS AT MIT FOR A WEEKEND
AND THEY HAVE A PROGRAMWHERE YOU CAN COME IN AND
TEACH A BUNCH OF HIGH-SCHOOLSTUDENTS ON ANY SUBJECT
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.
THERE'S NO LIKE CHECKINGCREDENTIALS OR ANYTHING.
AND SO -- .
>> Stephen: REALLY, AND THEYJUST TRUST HIGH SCHOOL AGED
CHILDREN WITH MEN WHO COMEIN WITH NO CREDENTIALS.
>> YEAH, I HAD A COUPLEFRIENDS TEACHING CLASS, ONE
DOING OPERATING SYSTEMDESIGN, ANOTHER ROOT BEER
TASTING.
AND I SAID I WILL TEACH ACLASS ON THE PHYSICS OF
ENERGY.
BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING IHAD BEEN STUDYING AND
THINKING ABOUT A LOT AT THATTIME.
AND SO I DID, AND I HADNEVER DONE A LECTURE BEFORE.
SO I STARTED WALKING THESEKIDS THROUGH, YOU KNOW, ALL
OF THE EQUATIONS I LEARNED.
I TRIED TO MAKE ITINTERESTING, BUT LIKE BY THE
FIRST HOUR I COULD TELL THEYWEREN'T REALLY, THEY WEREN'T
REALLY WITH ME.
I RECOGNIZED THE BOREDEXPRESSIONS, BECAUSE I'VE
BEEN THAT STUDENT SO MANYTIMES.
SO I PULLED OUT AN EXAMPLE
AND STARTED ANALYZING STARTREK.
(LAUGHTER)SO I STARTED-- I STARTED
ANALYZING SCIENCE FICTIONSCENES.
SOW I SAID YODA WHEN HEPULLS THE XWING OUT OF THE SWAMP
IN THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF ENERGY BEING USEDTHERE.
>> Stephen: NO, A CERTAINAMOUNT OF FORCE IS BEING
USED THERE, I HATE TOCORRECT YOU.
>> RIGHT, WELL-- .
>> Stephen: RANDALL, THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: RANDALL MONROE,THE BOOK IS WHAT IF.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
