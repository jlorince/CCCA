>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE, NATION.
FOLKS, NATION, YESTERDAY THE
BUSH TAX CUTS WERE EXTENDED FOR
EVERYONE.
AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF FIGHTING,
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
FINALLY SHOWED BIPARTISANSHIP IN
THAT REPUBLICANS OFFERED
PARTISANSHIP, AND THE PRESIDENT
AGREED TO BUY IT.
OF COURSE, THE DOOM-CRYING
MATHLETES OUT THERE SAY THAT IN
JUST THE NEXT TWO YEARS ALONE,
THIS EXTENSION OF THE TAX CUTS
WILL ADD $501 BILLION TO THE
DEFICIT, BUT WILL IT REALLY?
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW THE DEFICIT IS
$1.3 TRILLION.
BUT IF YOU MAKE THE DEFICIT BIG
ENOUGH, EVENTUALLY WE'LL ONLY
SEE ZEROS.
NO DEFICIT.
AND, FOLKS, IF WE JUST KEEP
ADDING TO IT, EVENTUALLY IT WILL
REACH INFINITY, AND WE JUST TURN
OUR HEADS SIDEWAYS AND, BOOM,
IT'S AN EIGHT.
EIGHT.
THAT'S NOT MUCH.
I'LL PAY THAT OFF MYSELF.
HERE'S A SAWBUCK.
HERE'S A SAWBUCK.
OKAY.
KEEP THE CHANGE, AMERICA.
AND THESE TAX CUTS DON'T JUST
FIX THE DEFICIT, FOLKS.
THEY FIX THE JOB MARKET.
RIGHT, JOHN BOEHNER?
>> I THINK EXTENDING ALL OF THE
CURRENT TAX RATES WILL BE THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO
TO HELP CREATE JOBS IN THE
COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN: YES, DOING NOTHING
IS THE INJECTION OUR STAGNANT
ECONOMY NEEDS.
JIMMY, UNLEASH THE PROSPERITY.
THERE YOU GO, AMERICA.
THERE YOU GO.
THERE'S YOUR PROSPERITY,
AMERICA.
OH, AND WHAT'S THIS?
UH-OH.
OH.
THIS WAS MY BENEFIT FROM THE TAX
CUTS.
IT'S HARD TO TELL BECAUSE IT
JUST GOT DESTROYED ON THE
DISSENT, BUT MY BALLOON WAS MADE
BY LOUIS VUITTON.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, WELL.
ALL OF THE JOKES FOR THE NEXT
MINUTE ARE ABOUT MY BALLOON.
