HEY, RIC!
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.

LONG-TIME FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN ON
HERE, YOU HELPED TALK ABOUT HOW
IT'S POSSIBLE TO WALK ON WATER.
>> YUP.
>> Stephen: YOU PUT TODD
RUNDGREN ON NOTICE BOARD.
>> Stephen: OH, I DID.
>> Stephen: YOU WENT ALONG
WHERE MY STAGE MANAGER BOBBY TO
HELP FIND MY EAGLE SON, STEPHEN,
JR.
>> YUP.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
THAT.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen: AND NOW YOU'VE GOT
THE BAND THE CARS.
YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING TOGETHER
AGAIN AND YOU RELEASED YOUR
FIRST STUDIO ALBUM IN 24 YEARS
"MOVE LIKE THIS."
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IT'S... THE
REVIEWS ARE INCREDIBLE.
AND I AM FLATTERED THAT YOU
WOULD PUT OUT A WHOLE ALBUM JUST
TO GET BACK ON MY SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE DID IT.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU GUYS
PLAYING TOGETHER AGAIN?
I'M THRILLED BECAUSE I... YOU
KNOW, YOU WERE HUGE A HUGE BAND
FOR ME.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS AGAIN?
>> WELL, REALLY IT WAS JUST A
MATTER OF WRITING SOME NEW SONGS
AND THEN TRYING TO THINK WHO
WOULD BE THE BEST PEOPLE TO PLAY
THOSE SONGS AND WHO I HAD THE
MOST FUN WITH IN THE BUSINESS
AND SINCE THERE'S NO BUSINESS
ANYMORE ANYWAY I FIGURED WE'D
JUST DO A RECORD, PUT IT OUT ON
THE INTERNET AND HAVE FUN WITH
IT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THE
INTERNET?
>> I DO.
> Stephen: VERY POPULAR WITH.>
THE KIDS.
THEY LIKE IT.
>> I AGREE.
>> Stephen: LONG TIME VIEWERS
OF THE SHOW WILL ALSO REMEMBER
THAT YOUR WIFE, SUPERMODEL
PAULINA PORIZKOVA HAS KIND OF A
CRUSH ON ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT, YEAH.
>> Stephen: I'M SORT OF HER
HALL PASS.
IS THIS AWKWARD FOR YOU?
NO, NO, I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN IN
THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> SO I DON'T REALLY GET TOO
UNNERVED BY IT.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU
PAULINA?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> I AM GREAT, THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: OH, FANTASTIC,
NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.
I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT RIC NOW.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: WHY AREN'T YOU
GUYS IN THE ROCK 'N ROLL HALL OF
FAME?
IS IT BECAUSE YOU USE STEROIDS?
DID YOU JUICE?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO BE IN
IT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I DID WANT TO
BE IN IT I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE
NOT IN IT.
>> Stephen: WELL, THERE'S NO
AWARD THAT I WOULD NOT ACCEPT.
(LAUGHTER)
CAN I HAVE IT IF THEY GIVE IT TO
YOU?
CAN I HAVE YOURS?
>> I'LL BRING IN THE AND YOU CAN
PUT IT UP THERE WITH ALL THOSE
OTHER BEAUTIFUL AWARDS.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
WITH MY PEABODY AND MY EMMY.
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN THE '80s
BEING A ROCK BAND SOMEHOW
INFLUENTIAL WAS REAGAN ON YOUR
MUSIC?
(LAUGHTER)
FOR SOME REASON IT WAS A GOOD
TIME FOR US SO I ALMOST DIDN'T
MIND REAGAN AT THE TIME.
I FIGURED THAT'S WHY IT WAS
GOOD, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE SUPPRESSED EVERYONE AND
IT CAUSED A SOCIAL SCENE AND IT
WAS THE PUNKS AND THE NEW WAVERS
AND TO ME IT WAS A MUCH MORE
EXCITING TIME THAN NOW.
>> Stephen: SEE, I DIDN'T CARE
FOR THAT.
THE PUNKS AND NEW WAVERS SEEMED
RELATED TO AN ART MOVEMENT OR
SOCIAL MOVEMENT.
>> THAT'S WHAT I THINK, YES.
>> Stephen: BUT SHOULDN'T IT
JUST BE ABOUT CASH?
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
WHO'S SUCCESSFUL.
WHO HAS THE GOLD ALBUMS.
>> WELL, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
TODAY.
>> Stephen: THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" SAID ON YOUR SHOW "THEY
LOOK NO DORKIER NOW THAN THEY
DID AT THEIR PEAK."
(LAUGHTER)
DOES THAT PLEASE YOU OR ARE YOU
DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU HAVEN'T
ACHIEVED GREATER DORKDOM IN THE
LAST 24 YEARS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A
LITTLE MORE DORKY BUT I GUESS
I'M JUST THE SAME DORKNESS.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE STALLED.
>> I'VE STALLED AT THIS ONE
LEVEL OF DORKNESS.
I THINK I'M ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OF DORKNESS.
>> Stephen: WELL, YOU MARRIED
A SUPERMODEL YOU COULD HAVE
ACHIEVED SUPERDORK.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: ANTHONY DECURTIS
OF "ROLLING STONE" SAID YOUR
SOUND IS SO CONTEMPORARY YOU
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE ONE
OF YOUR SONGS DONE ON GLEE."
IN A RELATED TOPIC, DO YOU EVER
HAVE THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE?
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NO?
WILL YOU COME BACK... YOU'LL DO
A SONG WHEN WE COME BACK?
>> Stephen: I'D LOVE TO.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE
BEAUTIFUL.
RIC OCASEK, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH A PERFORMANCE FROM THE
CARS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
