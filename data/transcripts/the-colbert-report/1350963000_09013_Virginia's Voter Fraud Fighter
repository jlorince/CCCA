( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CHANTING STEPHEN'S NAME]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, TONIGHT IS THE THIRD AND
FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
BETWEEN FORMER GOVERNOR MITT
ROMNEY AND FUTURE FORMER
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M TIVOING IT, SO NOBODY TELL
ME WHETHER THE MODERATE OR
CONSERVATE ROMNEY KICKED THE
LETHARGIC OR ENERGETIC OBAMA'S
ASS.
LOVE LAUGH A LOT OF OPTION
THERE'S.
-- OPTIONS THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, THESE DEBATES MAY NOT
MATTER AT ALL.
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE ISSUE THAT
COULD INVALIDATE THE ENTIRE
ELECTION.
>> VOTER FRAUD IT'S A BIG
CONCERN IN THIS CASE.
>> VOTER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS.
VOTER FRAUD?
>> STEPHEN: YES, VOTER FRAUD.
NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO BORE YOU
WITH ANY SHOCKING EXAMPLES OF
VOTER FRAUD BECAUSE IT IS
VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I SAY WE CAN'T BE TOO
CAREFUL, FOLKS.
ANYBODY VOTING THAT I DON'T
PERSONALLY KNOW IS KIND OF
SUSPICIOUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANKFULLY, THERE ARE SOME
HEROES OUT THERE TRYING TO KEEP
THIS PROCESS PURE.
>> A REPUBLICAN WORKER IS
ARRESTED FOR VOTER FRAUD.
>> HE IS A CONTRACTOR.
>> SOMEONE WORKING AT A BUSINESS
IN A LOCAL G.O.P. HEADQUARTERS
BUILDING SPOTTED A MAN DUMPING
VOTER REGISTRATION FORM.
THEY FOUND 8 COMPLETED FORMS IN
THE DUMPSTER.
>> STEPHEN: SO, SOME VOTER FORMS
GOT DUMPED.
THAT'S HOW THE ELECTORAL SAUSAGE
IS MADE, FOLKS.
AND LIKE WITH SAUSAGE, IT'S
OFTEN TAINTED, AND ONCE IN A
WHILE AN (bleep) GETS IN THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GROUND UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, I CONDEMN THIS MAN'S
ACTIONS.
YOU DESTROYED VOTER REGISTRATION
FORMS, BUT ONLY EIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S THE MATTER, WAS THE PAPER
STOCK TOO HEAVY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU SHRED THEM,
OR BURY THEM, OR BATTER FRY THEM
AT THE STATE FAIR?
[ LAUGHTER ]
FRANKLY, I'D HAVE EXPECTED
BETTER FROM THE ALBINO MONK FROM
THE DA VINCI CODE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, OF COURSE, THE VOTER
WATCHDOG SPOILSPORTS AT THE FEC
WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT
TAMPERING WITH VOTER
REGISTRATION IS A "FEDERAL
CRIME" JUST BECAUSE "IT IS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I SAY, IT'S ALL PART OF THE
GAME -- THE DEMOCRATS TRY TO
REGISTER VOTERS AND BUS THEM TO
POLLING STATIONS.
AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE JUST
PLAYING DEFENSE, BIG D, 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHAT WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS.
OH, BY THE WAY, SOME POLLING
PLACES WILL HAVE LINEBACKERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO WEAR A CUP.
BUT FOR ANY DEMOCRATS STILL
WORRIED THAT YOUR VOTER
REGISTRATION FORMS MAY HAVE
ENDED UP IN THE GARBAGE, DON'T
WORRY, YOU HAVE A SPECIALLY
DESIGNATED POLLING PLACE:
THE DUMP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY?
OF COURSE, IF YOU CAN'T GET TO
THE DUMP ON ELECTION DAY, WHICH
REMEMBER, THIS YEAR IS ON
NOVEMBER 32ND.
OKAY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I BELIEVE THAT'S A THRENSDAY,
WE'LL CHECK ON THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU CAN JUST WRITE YOUR VOTE ON
A PIECE OF LEGAL SIZED PAPER.
OKAY?
PUT YOUR VOTE THRON.
AND THEN, DON'T FORGET TO DEPOZ
IT-6--- DEPOSIT IT IN
ONE OF THESE HANDY HOME BALLOT
BOXES.
SO CONVENIENT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
POINT IS, IT'S YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE YOUR VOTE
COUNTED ON ELECTION DAY.
UNLESS YOU VOTED FOR OBAMA IN
2008.
