EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ARTIST
KNOWN FOR HIS GIANT PORTRAIT.
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO CAN PAINT MY
BALL'S ACTUAL SIZE.
PLEASE WELCOME CHUCK CLOSE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BOOM!
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE BIGGEST, MOST FAMOUS ARTIST
I'VE EVER HAD ON THE SHOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A FAMOUS
PORTRAIT PAINTER, AMONG OTHER
THINGS.
YOU EVER HAVE PAINTING IN THE
NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.
>> AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE A
PORTRAIT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON
HANGING IN THERE RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: REALLY, REALLY?
I'VE HAD MY PORTRAIT IN THE
NATIONAL PORT RAL GALLERY.
SO WE'RE KIND OF EVEN.
WE'RE KIND OF EVEN.
YEAH.
>> YOURS WAS NEXT TO THE MEN'S
ROOM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
I BET I GOT MORE HEAVY TRAFFIC
THAN YOURS DID.
>> I'M HANGING BETWEEN THE TWO
BUSHES.
I'D RATHER BE NEXT TO THE MEN'S
ROOM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS.
JIM, LET'S GO TO THE FIRST
PORTRAIT.
OKAY.
NOW, THIS IS A SELF-PORTRAIT,
CORRECT?
>> YES.
>>
>> Stephen: FROM I'M GUESSING
NOT YESTERDAY.
>> FROM 1968.
>> Stephen: 168.
YOUR PORTRAITURE, I CAN TELL
WHAT IT IS.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE GUYS
THAT JUST SLAPS PAINT ON A
CANVAS AND SAYS, THERE, THAT'S
ART, MAIL IT TO MOMA.
I CAN TELL WHAT YOUR STUFF.
IS
>> I APPRECIATE THAT YOU CAN.
I TRY TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen: DOES THAT PUT YOU
ON THE OUTS BACK WITH THE
ELITES.
BACK WHEN YOU WERE OUT IT WAS
SOUP CANS.
DID YOU GET A LOT OF BEEF FOR
THIS?
>> PAINTING WAS DEAD AND
REPRESENTATIONAL PAINTINGS WAS
EVEN DEADER, AND PORTRAITS WAS
ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE PALE.
NOBODY WANTED TO DO IT.
SO I THOUGHT, WELL, THIS IS A
GOOD AREA TO GO INTO BECAUSE I
WON'T HAVE MUCH COMPETITION.
>> Stephen: YOU LIKE BEING
ALONE?
LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ONE HERE.
THIS IS NOT A PHOTOGRAPH.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT A
PHOTOGRAPH.
LET'S SHOW IS PROCESS THAT GOES
INTO THIS.
THIS IS THE SIZE THAT YOU WORK
IN.
ENORMOUS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE
ENORMOUS FRIENDS, OR IS THIS...
[LAUGHTER]
WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THIS SCALE?
>> I USED TO SAY THE BIGGER THEY
ARE, THE LONGER THEY TAKE TO
WALK BY, AND THEREFORE THE
HARDER THEY ARE TO IGNORE.
>> Stephen: SO THIS IS A WAY
OF GRABBING SOMEONE BY THE
COLLAR IN THE ART GALLERY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: I LIKE THE WAY YOU
DO THIS.
YOU LAY IN... ARE YOU LAYING IN
DIFFERENT COLORS?
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY MADE FROM
THREE ONE-COLORED PAINTINGS
LAYERED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
>> Stephen: DO YOU EVER RUN
OUT OF TONER?
>> I WAS THERE BEFORE
COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGERY,
BEFORE TONER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S KIND OF HOW
YOU DO IT.
DID YOU GET RIPPED OFF BY LIKE
H.P.?
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ONE HERE.
>> I WAS WATCHING TV.
I WATCH YOU EVERY DAY.
>> Stephen: YOU WATCH ME EVERY
DAY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE AN ARTIST.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS IS THE STUFF I REALLY LIKE
THIS.
IS AGAIN LARGE SCALE.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: LARGE SCALE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHO IS THIS?
>> ROY LIECHTENSTEIN, PART OF MY
OLD MEN WITH PONYTAIL SERIES.
>> Stephen: EACH ONE OF THESE,
CLOSER SHOT, JIM, EACH ONE OF
THE LITTLE CELLS IN THERE IS
LIKE ITS OWN LITTLE ABSTRACT
PAINTING.
>> I GET A LITTLE PLEASURE
FINISHING EACH PIECE.
I DON'T HAVE TO POSTPONE THE
PLEASURE UNTIL THE END.
>> Stephen: HOW HOW LONG DOES IT
TAKE TO DO EACH ONE OF THESE
LITTLE PAINTINGS?
>> I CAN THIS A ROW A DAY MAYBE.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
LET'S GO TO THE NEXT PAINTING, A
SELF-PORTRAIT OF YOU.
LET'S SHOW THE PROCESS BY WHICH
THIS IS MADE.
SO THIS IS MID-PROCESS.
>> UH-HUH.
FROM THE TAPE UP IS TWO PASSES,
AND FROM THE TAPE DOWN IS ONLY
THE FIRST PASS.
THE FIRST PASS IS RELATIVELY
ARBITRARILY PICKED COLORS SO
THAT I'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ON TOP OF IT.
>> Stephen: THIS IS SO, SO
SPECIFIC, IT'S SO FASTIDIOUS
THIS WORK.
ARE WE BY ENJOYING YOUR WORK AND
BUYING IT, ARE WE REWARDING YOUR
O.C.D.?
LIKE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS,
DO YOU AFTER ALPHABETIZE YOUR
PAPERCLIP, TOUCH EVERY DOORKNOB
IN THE HOUSE?
>> I HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES,
AND IT UNDOUBTEDLY DROVE ME TO
DO WHAT I'M DOING.
>> Stephen: WHAT LEARNING
DISABILITY DO YOU HAVE?
>> FOR ONE THING, I HAVE FACE
BLINDNESS.
>> Steve: YOU HAVE FACE
BLINDNESS?
SO YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON ALL
THIS GOODNESS RIGHT HERE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT DID YOU WRITE DOWN THERE?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Stephen: SARAH PALIN HAS
THAT WRITTEN ON HER HAND, TOO,
BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT
MEANS.
>> IT'S A BRILLIANT THING.
IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT IN
SCHOOL, I WOULD HAVE DONE SO
MUCH BETTER.
>> Stephen: SO YOU CAN'T
RECOGNIZE SOMEONE'S FACE?
>> I HAVE A HARD TIME
RECOGNIZING FACES.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU PAINT
PORTRAITS?
>> THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I COMMIT THEM TO MEMORY BY
FLATTENING THEM OUT AND
CAREFULLY SCANNING THEM.
>> Stephen: FLATTENING THEM
OUT LIKE A SERIAL KILLER?
HOW DO YOU FLATTEN THEM OUT?
THAT SOUNDS PAINFUL, CHUCK.
>> BESIDES BEING FACE, IT'S
COLORED DIRT ON A FLAT SURFACE.
>> Stephen: THE PAINTING.
IS WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU WATCH ME
ON TV, THAT'S A FLAT IMAGE.
CAN YOU REMEMBER MY FACE FROM
TV?
>> IN REAL LIFE WHEN YOU MOVE
YOUR HEAD HALF AN INCH, TO ME
IT'S A NEW FACE, BUT ONCE IT'S
FLAT...
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> ONCE IT'S FLAT, I DIDN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE A WOMAN I HAD LIVED
WITH FOR TWO YEARS A YEAR LATER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT
EXCUSE IN A DIVORCE PROCEEDING.
CHUCK CLOSE, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
