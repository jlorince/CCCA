REPORTING ABSOLUTELY NO INFORMATION.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE WE CONSERVATIVES ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE COURT MAJORITY WILL RULE IN OUR FAVOR.
HOW CONFIDENT?
RICHARD MOURDOCK, INDIANA GOP SENATE CANDIDATE AND DARK LORD OF THE THE WIZARD-- PRETAPED HIS
REACTION TO THE EVENTUAL RULING LAST THURSDAY AND ACCIDENTALLY POSTED HIS PREFONT ON YOUTUBE.
>> WE HAVE HAD OUR BRIEF MOMENT OF CELEBRATION BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT
RULED THAT OBAMACARE IS, IN FACT, UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
4R56 LAUGH -- (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THIS IS ONE OF THE BRIEFEST MOMENTS OF CELEBRATION I'VE EVER SEEN.
BUT FOLKS IT IS INSPIRING TO SEE A MAN SO CONFIDENT IN PREVAILING THAT HE PUTS HIS
BALLS ON THE FELT AND DOCUMENTS HIS PREDICTION.
AND THREE OTHER PREDICTIONS.
>> WELL, THE SUPREME COURT HAS DONE WHAT NONE OF US REALLY THOUGHT COULD HAPPEN.
THEY HAVE RULED OBAMACARE CONSTITUTIONAL.
>> WE NOW KNOW OBAMA CARE CAME DOWN TO THE SPLIT DECISION.
THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DONE PART BUT NOT ALL OF THE HEALTH-CARE BILL.
>> THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS DONE WHAT NONE OF US EXPECTED.
THEY FOUND AN ANSWER TO THE HEALTH-CARE ISSUE WHICH BASICALLY LEAD THEM TO NO DECISION AT ALL.
>> Stephen: IT'S JUST-- IT'S JUST SMART TO COVER YOUR
BASES WHILE YOU'VE GOT THE CAMERA CREW THERE.
I MEAN WHO KNOWS THE NEXT TIME YOU'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THROW
TOGETHER A BRICK WALL AND AN EDISON WAX RECORDER.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I LOVE THIS.
BUT MY ONLY CRITICISM HERE IS THAT THE ONLY OPTIONS MOURDOCK PREPARED FOR WERE
OVERTURNED, NOT OVERTURNED,
HALF OVERTURNED AND NO ANSWER.
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER POSSIBILITIES?
I MEAN I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE READY FOR ANYTHING.
JIM?
>> THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS DONE WHAT NONE OF US HAVE EXPECTED.
THE MANDATE HAS BEEN STRUCK DOWN.
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER RECOUNT,
AND GEORGE BUSH IS PRESIDENT AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN A HOTLY CONTESTED 5-4 DECISION HAS
DECLARED THAT CARLY RAY-- CALL ME MAYBE IS THE SONG OF THE SUMMER.
ALSO NO HEALTH CARE.
>> TODAY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DID WHAT NONE OF US EXPECTED.
JUSTICE SCALIA REVEALED THAT THE WHOLE TIME HE'S JUST BEEN FOUR RACCOONS IN A
BLACK GARBAGE BAG.
SAD NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS COMMITTED OCTUPLE MURDER SUICIDE.
AM LEAVING ONLY CLARENCE THOMAS TO RULE ON OBAMA CARE.
HE HAS REMAINED SILENT.
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SURPRISED MANY ANALYSTS TODAY WHEN JUSTICE
ALITO ANNOUNCED HE WILL BE STEPPING DOWN FROM THE BENCH TO BECOME THE BASE PLAYER FOR IRON MAIDEN.
>> TODAY THE LONG-AWAITED DECISION ON OBAMACARE CAME DOWN-- EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME,
I SAID NOBODY IN THE BREAK ROOM, OKAY.
GET OUT, OUT.
>> Stephen: WE'LL STAY ON
