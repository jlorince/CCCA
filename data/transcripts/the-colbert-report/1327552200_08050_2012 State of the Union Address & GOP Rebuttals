(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH!
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US!
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN").
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, THAT WAS... THANK
YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT
WAS GOOD OF YOU.
THAT WAS... THAT WAS LAWFUL GOOD
OF YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
SOME OF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU
WITH US.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THREE YEARS AGO
BARACK OBAMA PROMISED US CHANGE.
BUT LAST NIGHT ONCE AGAIN
PRESIDENT "LOOK AT ME I'M THE
PRESIDENT" RUINED ANOTHER
PERFECTLY GOOD NIGHT OF T.V.
(LAUGHTER)
BY ADDRESSING YET ANOTHER JOINT
SESSION OF CONGRESS.
IS IT ME, OR DIDN'T HE JUST DO
THAT LIKE A YEAR AGO?
(LAUGHTER)
I SWEAR THIS GUY'S GOT O.C.D .
OH, GOT TO TOUCH EVERY KNOB IN
THE HOUSE.
GOT TO FLIP THE LIGHT SWITCH 50
TIMES.
GOT TO ADDRESS CONGRESS ONCE A
YEAR.
GET SOME HELP.
(LAUGHTER)
HE PREEMPTED MY FAVORITE SHOW.
TUESDAY NIGHT WITHOUT "N.C.I.S.:
LOS ANGELES" IS LIKE L.L. COOL
J. WITHOUT CHRIS O'DONNELL.
IT'S UNNATURAL.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FOLKS, I AM NOT GOING TO
MAKE YOU SUFFER THROUGH HIS
WHOLE PARTISAN POUT FEST BUT I
DO WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE MOMENT.
WE ALL KNOW THIS COUNTRY IN DEEP
TROUBLE BUT THIS CLOWN, TO HIM
IT'S ALL A BIG JOKE.
>> WE GOT RID OF ONE RULE FROM
40 YEARS AGO THAT COULD HAVE
FORCED SOME DAIRY FARMERS TO
SPEND $10,000 A YEAR PROVING
THAT THEY COULD CONTAIN A SPILL
BECAUSE MILK WAS SOMEHOW
CLASSIFIED AS AN OIL.
WITH A RULE LIKE THAT, I GUESS
IT WAS WORTH CRYING OVER SPILLED
MILK.
(MILD LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OH,
HARDY-HAAR-HAAR.
IT IS TO LAUGH WHILE THE JAY
LENO IN CHIEF WAS CRACKING WISE
THE CRIME RATE IN THIS COUNTRY
IS SOARING.
WHY, JUST YESTERDAY TWO PEANUTS
WERE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND
ONE WAS ASSAULTED!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUE STORY.
TRUE STORY.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, OBAMA'S LITTLE HISSY
FIT WAS MERELY THE OPENING ACT
FOR THE REAL STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS-- THE REBUTTAL.
FIRST THE G.O.P.'S RESPONSE CAME
FROM INDIANA GOVERNOR AND SHRINK
RAY EXPERIMENT MITCH DANIELS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE SPEECH EVERYONE'S
TALKING ABOUT CAME FROM MY BUDDY
HERMAN CAIN AT THE NATIONAL
PRESS CLUB.
CAIN GAVE THE REBUTTAL FOR THE
TEAM AS WELL AS HIS OWN GROUP
THE "STAY ON T.V. PARTY."
IN THE SPEECH, CAIN ADDRESSED
THE ISSUE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT
MOST.
>> I THINK STEPHEN COLBERT'S
ENDORSEMENT OF ME IS A MARVELOUS
THING.
AND HERE'S WHY: ONE OF THE OTHER
THINGS
THINGS THAT I AND MY
ORGANIZATION HAS AN AN OBJECTIVE
IS TO KEEP THE YOUTH VOTE
INSPIRED.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AND
WATCH THE SHOWS THAT SOME OF US
MORE MATURE PEOPLE WATCH TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RACE.
THEY'RE WATCHING THE STEPHEN
COLBERTS.
>> Stephen: WELL SAID, SIR
HERMAN CAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES.
THE MORE MATURE PEEP WATCH OTHER
THINGS.
BUT THE MORE IMMATURE YOUTH VOTE
WATCHES THIS SHOW.
WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT I'M
ENDORSING SENATOR DUED YVONNE
POOPING PANTS.
VON POOPING PANTS, YOU CAN
DEPENDS ON HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
