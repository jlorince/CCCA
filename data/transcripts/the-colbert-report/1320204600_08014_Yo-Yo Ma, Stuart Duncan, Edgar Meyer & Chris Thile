SESSIONS."
WHAT'S A GOAT RODEO?
(LAUGHTER)

PICTURING MONKEYS IN COWBOY HATS
RIDING GOATS.
HOW CLOSE AM I?
I THINK I'VE SEEN THAT ON ESPN

WHAT'S A GOAT RODEO.
>> YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE.
A GOAT RODEO WE'RE LED TO
BELIEVE IS A SITUATION THAT'S SO
VERY CHAOTIC THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD HAVE TO GO RIGHT FOR
EVERYONE NOT TO BE SCREWED.

THE SHOW BEFORE, EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU'RE THE CELLO MASTER
EXTRAORDINAIRE.
BUT ALL THESE OTHER MUSICIANS

MASTER.

I'M OLDER THAN ALL THESE PEOPLE.

CLASS?
BECAUSE YOU'RE CLASSY, YOU'RE...
THE CELLO... YOU'RE A CLASSY
GUY.
YOU'RE CLASS ON TAP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU
TO SAY BUT I DO NOT TWIN
MacARTHUR PRIZE.
>> Stephen: NO, YOU'RE JUST...
YOU JUST WON THE MEDAL OF
FREEDOM FROM THE PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
RIGHT?
IS THAT ALL?
OH, THIS LITTLE THING, I ONLY
WEAR IT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
DOES HE EVER PLAY THE YO-YO MA
CARD ON YOU GUYS?
DOES HE EVER SAY "REMEMBER WHEN
WE WERE ALL PLAYING AT THE
INAUGURAL?
OH, I FORGOT, THAT WAS JUST ME."
(LAUGHTER)
TELL ME ABOUT "THE GOAT RODEO
SESSIONS."
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS
MUSIC?
>> IT'S GENRE-PROOF.
>> Stephen: AS AN AMERICAN, I
HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO
PIGEON HOLE YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> EXACTLY.
THIS IS TOTALLY AMERICAN.
>> Stephen: IT'S TOTALLY
AMERICAN?
>> YES, TOTALLY.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S... HOW...
WHAT?
SO IT'S WHAT?
IT'S BELCHING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM?
WHAT IS... WHAT'S TOTALLY
AMERICAN MEAN TO YOU, YO-YO?
>> WELL, LET'S SEE, WHAT'S
TOTALLYERN?
IT HAS BLUEGRASS ELEMENTS IN IT,
CELTIC ELEMENTS IN IT, BLUEGRASS
BEING ROOT MUSIC AND FROM
APPALACHIA, FROM DIXIE LAND,
FROM THE BLUES, IN FACT.
SO... AND OF COURSE WE NEEDED
SOME GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION SO
THEY HAVE HIRED ME...
(LAUGHTER)
TO KIND OF FILL THE ROLE OF, YOU
KNOW, THE CELLO ROLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THEY SAY IF IT AIN'T
GOT THAT CELLO IT DON'T THAT
MELLOW.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
YO-YO, YOU'VE DONE SOME MANY
GENRES, CROSSED OVER INTO SO
MANY GENRES.
WHAT'S NEXT?
THRASH METAL?
FOLK SUNK IN TRIP HOUSE?
CHILL WAVE?
>> SHREDDING.
>> Stephen: SHREDING?
HOW WOULD ONE SHRED ON A CELLO?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS THAT'S AN EXPLORATION.
I THINK WE'RE ALL JOINED
TOGETHER TO TRY TO GO TO DO TWO
THINGS, WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING
VERY WELL BUT WE ALSO WANT TO
TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK TO
GO TO THE EDGE WHERE YOU SEE A
BETTER VIEW.
AND SHREDDING MIGHT BE THE NEXT
THING.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT MY FRIENDS
WANT TO DO AND WHAT THEY SHOW ME
BECAUSE I KEEP LEARNING WHEN MY
FRIENDS TEACH ME NEW THINGS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GUYS READY
TO ALL TEACH US SOMETHING RIGHT
NOW
>> SHRED AWAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, YO-YO MA, STEWART
DUNCAN, EDGAR MEYER AND CHRIS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK FROM "THE
GOAT RODEO SESSIONS."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
