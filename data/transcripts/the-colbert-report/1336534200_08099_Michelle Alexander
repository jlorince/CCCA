[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE WITH HER BOOK CALLED THE NEW JIM-CROW.
I HOPE HE'S MORE FUN THAN THE OLD JIM-CROW.
THAT GUY WAS A JERK.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHELLE ALEXANDER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
YOU ARE A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER.
YOU TEACH LAW AT OHIO STATE,
CORRECT?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: YOU HAVE A BOOK HERE CALLED THE NEW JIM-CROW MASS INCARCERATION IN THE AGE OF
COLOR BLINDNESS.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE NEW JIM-CROW.
WE HAD AN OLD JIM-CROW WE GOT RID OF THAT, RIGHT?
>> IT WAS A SYSTEM OF RULES,
LAWS, CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES THAT OPERATED TO LOCK AFRICAN-AMERICANS INTO A
PERMANENT SECOND CLASS STATUS AUTHORIZING LEGAL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE.
TODAY WE HAVE A NEW SYSTEM OF RACIAL AND SOCIAL CONTROL A SYSTEM OF MASS INCARCERATION
THAT OPERATES IN WAYS EERILY REMINISCENT OF A SYSTEM WE SUPPOSEDLY LEFT BEHIND THANKS TO
THE WAR ON DRUGS AND GET TOUGH MOVEMENT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE GOING AFTER MY MAN RONALD REAGAN NOW.
>> YES, YES.
>> STEPHEN: REAGAN STARTED THE WAR ON DRUGS.
JUST SAY NO.
DO YOU REMEMBER JUST SAY NO.
>> I REMEMBER THAT, YES I DO.
>> STEPHEN: WHY DID NOT BLACK PEOPLE JUST SAY NO THEN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
ARE YOU SAYING BLACK PEOPLE ARE BEING INCARCERATED WITH THE WAR ON DRUGS.
>> THEY ARE BEING INCARCERATED AT A GROSSLY DISPROPORTIONATE RATE EVEN THOUGH STUDIES SHOW
THAT CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF PEOPLE OF COLOR DO NOT USE OR SELL ILLEGAL DRUGS AT HIGHER
RATES THAN WHITES.
>> STEPHEN: IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT WHITE PEOPLE AND BLACK PEOPLE DO DRUGS AT THE SAME
RIGHT WHY DIDN'T DAVID SIMON SET THE WIRE IN GREENWICH,
CONNECTICUT?
>> PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE BUT THE SHOW MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE BORING.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE SAYING WHITE DRUG ABUSERS ARE BORING?
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO BE COOLER THAT TOO?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> PEOPLE WHO USE AND SELL DRUGS BUT ALSO HAVE JOBS LIFE IN DECENT NEIGHBORHOODS AND ALL
AFTER THIS MAY NOT PROVIDE AS MUCH ENTERTAINMENT AS PEOPLE STRUGGLING FOR BASIC SURVIVAL IN
POORER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.
>> STEPHEN: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR NOT, OKAY?
I DON'T SEE RACE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT RACE I AM.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I GET MY DRUGS FROM A PHARMACY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT AREN'T WE BEYOND SORT OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION OF ANY KIND IN THIS COUNTRY?
WE HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
>> NO, NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: WHAT PART OF THIS DON'T YOU GET?
>> THERE'S BEEN A LITERAL WAR WAGED AGAINST POORER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THE ANSWER.
ENOUGH COMPLAINING WHAT IS THE ANSWER IS?
>> WE NEED TO END THE WAR ON DRUGS ENTOO IRLY.
>> STEPHEN: LEGALIZE DRUGS.
>> WE NEED TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, YOU KNOW DURING 1990'S DURING THE PERIOD OF THE GREATEST ESCALATION OF THE DRUG
WAR NEARLY 80% OF INCREASE IN ARRESTS WERE MARIJUANA POSSESSION.
HAVING THEM WITH CHARGES FOR LIFE.
>> STEPHEN: SHOULD WE OPEN THE FLOOD GATES AND LET THE PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL.
THAT'S NOT FAIR?
>> BELIEVE WE SHOULD RETURN TO THE RATES OF INCARCERATION FOR
STARTERS THE RATES WE HAD IN THE 1970'S BEFORE THE WAR ON DRUG AND GET TOUGH MOVEMENT KICKED OFF.
IF WE WERE TO DO THAT IT WOULD MEAN RELEASING FOUR OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE IN PRISON TODAY.
OUR PRISON POPULATION HAS QUINTUPLED.
>> STEPHEN: FOUR OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON?
IT WOULD BE MAD MAXIMUM CULTURE SNREETS IF WE DID THAT.
>> THE FEELING THAT THEY ARE OVERLY VIOLENT PREDATORS.
>> Stephen: THEY TURN INTO MUSLIMS.
I'VE SEEN THE MOVIES.
>> MOST PEOPLE SWEPT INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE ARRESTED FOR MINOR NONVIOLENT
AND DRUG RELATED OFFENSES,
CRIMES LIKE MARIJUANA POSSESSION.
>> STEPHEN: I'M SAYING IT'S SIMPLER TO JUST SAY NO.
RIGHT?
YOU CAN RELEASE ALL THE PEOPLE FROM JAIL AND GET RID OF THE DRUG LAWS OR JUST SAY NO.
YOUR ANSWER DOESN'T HAVE THE WORD JUST IN IT.
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT BUT IT'S JUST BE FAIR.
TREAT PEOPLE OF COLOR AS HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY OF DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND THE SAME CHANCES OF
LIFE OF PEOPLE GROWING UP IN MIDDLE CLASS WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO MAKE THE SAME KINDS OF
MISTAKES BUT ARE NOT ASKED TO PAY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES FOR THE MISTAKES AND BE REGULAR
GATED --
>> STEPHEN: BEST OF LUCK.
BEST OF LUCK.
MICHELLE ALEXANDER, "THE NEW JIM CROW." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
