WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, STEPHEN, IS
A TIE.
JUST IMAGINE YOURSELF WEARING
THAT TIE.
>> Stephen:  UH-HUH.
>> UNDERNEATH YOUR SHIRT IS
STRAPPED A CAMERA.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU SCRAP
THAT CAMERA ON YOUR CHEST TO
HIDE YOUR UGLY TIE?
>> NO, NO, THINK OF IT AS
REVERSED.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE STRAPS AND
THE CAMERA ARE UNDERNEATH YOUR
SHIRT.

SHIRT.
SP WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A CAMERA
CONCEALED BEHIND THE TIE.

HAVE A LITTLE HOLE, A LITTLE
HOLE IN THE TIE AND A CAMERA

YOU SEE THOSE LITTLE TOOLS
THERE-- KNIVES, SCREWDRIVERS?
ALL OF THOSE FIT INTO THE LITTLE
KIT THERE THAT CLOSES AND IT CAN
BE CONCEALED IN THE RECTUM.

CABOODLE GOES WHERE THE SUN
DON'T SHINE.
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

CAPTURE ME AND GO, "SURE, SEARCH
ME ANYWHERE, JUST NOT MY BUTT."

LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S MADE TO LOOK LIKE A
DICTIONARY.
IT'S A CONCEALMENT DEVICE.

THING GOES UP YOUR BUTT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO WE HAVE
HERE?
>> IT IS A PIPE GUN.
>> Stephen:  YOU COULD GO UP
TO A HIGH-VALUE TARGET.
>> HIGH-VALUE TARGET AND YOU
COULD SMOKE NEAR THEM FOR 20
YEARS AND KILL THEM WITH
SECONDHAND SMOKE.
>> YOU COULD DO THAT, THAT'S ONE
WAY.
>> Stephen:  NO ONE WOULD SEE
THAT COMING.
>> NOT FOR 20 YEARS.
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW UNTIL RIGHT
AT THE END.
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, STEPHEN, IS
A RECTAL CONCEALMENT DEVICE FOR
A CYANIDE CAPSULE.
IT'S ANOTHER RECTAL CONCEALMENT
DEVICE.
>> Stephen:  YES, YES, I'M
AWARE OF THAT.
I'M JUST-- THERE'S A LITTLE MORE
RECTAL ACTIVITY HERE THAN...
( LAUGHTER )
IS THERE NO OTHER PLACE TO HIDE
THINGS ON THE HUMAN BODY?
>> WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen:  I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
