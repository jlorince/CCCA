EVERYBODY.
NATION, YOU'RE VERY KIND.
THANK YOU.
NATION, I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT MY
GUEST TONIGHT, GOOGLE C.E.O.
ERIC SCHMIDT.
I ASSUME FOR EVERY QUESTION I
ASK HIM, HE WILL SHOW ME A
RELEVANT AD.
A POWERFUL MAN WITH ACCESS TO
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER GOOGLED
TO TEACHING YOUR CAT TO JET SKI
TO CAT FIRST AID TO ARE CATS
VENGEFUL?
AND FOLKS, PRIVACY ON THE
INTERNET HAS BECOME A HUGE,
SHOE.
TAKE THE RECENT NEWS ABOUT ONE
OF OUR MOST TREASURED ONLINE
INSTITUTIONS, CRAIGSLIST.
JIM?
>> ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 17
STATES SENT CRAIGSLIST A LETTER
DEMANDING THAT IT TAKE DOWN ITS
ADULT SERVICES SECTION.
>> IT LOOKS LIKE CRAIG LIST
ADULT SERVICES SECTION IS DONE
FOR GOOD.
A CRAIGSLIST OFFICIAL MADE THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT DURING A
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen: TYPICAL LIBERAL
CONGRESS SPILLING SECRETS.
THOSE ADS WERE CLASSIFIED.
FRANKLY I'M DISAPPOINTED.
CRAIGSLIST ADULT SERVICES
SECTION WAS A PERFECT PLACE TO
FIND HELP WITH GROWN-UP THINGS,
LIKE PLUMBING.
I PUT UP AN AD FOR LAYING SOME
PIPE AND I GOT A RESPONSE RIGHT
AWAY.
SO FRANKLY I WAS SURPRISED AT
THE MAN WHO SHOWED UP ONLY
BROUGHT ONE TOOL.
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, FOLKS, ADULT
SERVICES ALSO MEANS SEX, AND NOT
YOUR NORMAL LIGHTS-ON, ONE FOOT
ON THE FLOOR WEARING CHRISTMAS
SWEATER SEX.
BUT I SAY THE STATES ATTORNEY
GENERALS AREN'T DOING ENOUGH.
THEY MAY HAVE SHUT DOWN SMUT ON
CRAIGSLIST,BUT I HAVE JUST
LEARNED, AWB I HOPE YOU'RE
SITTING DOWN, FOLKS, THERE ARE
OTHER SITES ON THE INTERNET.
JIM?
>> THEY SHUT DOWN CRAIGSLIST
WITH THE ADULT SERVICES SECTION.
PLENTY MORE SITES AVAILABLE.
>> IT'S LIKE A GAME OF
WHACK-A-MOLE.
YOU KNOCK THEM DOWN IN ONE
PLACE, THEY POP UP SOMEPLACE
ELSE.
>> LIKE YOU SAID, WHACK-A-MOLE.
>>
>> Stephen: BY THE WAY,
WHACKING THE MOLE IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU'RE ALLOWED TO
SOLICIT ON CRAIGSLIST ANYMORE.
WELL, CLEARLY SOME WHACK A MOLE
FANS TONIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
CLEARLY WE NEED A SAFE, CLEAN
SITE FOR TRADING GOODS AND
SERVICES ONLINE.
THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO
INTRODUCE COLBERTSLIST.COM.
AT COLBERTSLIST.COM, I CLOSELY
MONITOR EVERY AD THE MAKE SURE
THEY'RE FREE FROM SEXUAL
SOLICITATION, JUST LOOK AT THIS
AD FROM OUR CARS AND TRUCKS
SECTION.
POWDER BLUE FORD PINTO, DENTED
FENDER.
MY HUSBAND LIKES THE WATCH.
I ASSUME HER HUSBAND IS SOME
KIND OF CONSUMER ADVOCATE.
OR THIS POSTING FROM MY JOBS'
SECTION.
MARINE BIOLOGIST LOOKING FOR A
QUALIFIED ASSISTANT.
WHO AM I KIDDING?
I NEED A B.J., $75.
SOUNDS LIKE A LUCRATIVE
POSITION, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE
WHY A MARINE BIOLOGIST NEEDS A
BEEKEEPER'S JACKET.
SO GO TO COLBERTSLIST.COM, WHERE
WE HAVE TAKEN THE "ASS" OUT OF
CLASSIFIED.
