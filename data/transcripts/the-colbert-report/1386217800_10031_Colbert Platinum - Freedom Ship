>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE
AS A WEALTH AMERICAN I'MCONSTANTLY BESEIGED BY
LEGIONS OF MOOFERNERS WHOWANT A PIECE OF THE PIE.
I SAY BACK OFF.
IF I GOT ANY EXTRA PIE I'MFEEDING IT TO THE BIRDS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET ALLMAD WHEN I MAKE THEM SING
FOR IT.
THIS IS COLBERT PLATINUM.
QUICK REMINDER, FOLKS, THISSEGMENT IS FOR PLATINUM
MEMBERS ONLY.
IF YOU ARE'S NOT WATCHINGTHIS ON A HOVER FLAT SCREEN
TRIMMED WITH UNBORN LEOPARDPELT WHY DON'T YOU SCAMPER
OFF TO T.G.I. FRIDAYS, TELLTHEM IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY,
MAYBE GET A FREE MUDSLIDE.
ALL RIGHT, PLATINUM NATION,WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW
WAYS TO ESCAPE THE BIGGOVERNMENT TAX MACHINE SO AS
MUCH AS I LOVE THIS COUNTRY,I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE AND ON TO AKICK ASS BOAT.
>> DRIFTING AWAY FROM THEREST OF THE WORLD, WE NOW
HAVE THE FREEDOM CHIP, THEONE MILE LONG 25 STORY TALL
MEGASHIP THAT IS MORE LIKE AFLOATING CITY THAN A BOAT.
IT WOULD CARRY UP TO 50,000FULL-TIME RESIDENTS.
UNCLEAR HOW TAXES WOULD WORKFOR PEOPLE THERE BUT THEY
SAID IT WILL NOT BE REGISTEREDIN THE UNITED STATES.
SO UNCLE SAM WOULD NOT BEABLE TO GET TO PEOPLE ON
THAT BOAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,THE FREEDOM SHIP WITH ALL
THE SLICK DESIGN OF ANUNFINISHED PARKING GARAGE.
AND EVERYTHING THE STATELESSBILLIONAIRE TYCOON NEEDS TO
FEEL AT HOME.
BANKS, CASINOS, AND A 1.7MILLION SQUARE FOOT
INTERNATIONAL SHOPPING MALL.
IMAGINE, AN ENORMOUS MALLYOU NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.
IT'S UP TO YOU, ANOTHERORANGE JULIUS OR A WATERY
GRAVE.
AND AS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS,FREEDOM SHIP OFFERS THE
ULTIMATE IN HIGH NET WORTHREAL ESTATE.
FOR AS LITTLE AS 9.1 MILLIONYOU CAN RESERVE A WATER VIEW
ULTIMATE APEX ROOM BOASTINGSUCH LUXURY AMENITIES AS
CARPETS, LIGHTS, ANDFINISHED WALLS.
WHAT?
FINISHED WALLS!
THAT'S LIKE THE HOT TUB OFBLOCKING WIND.
(LAUGHTER)FREEDOM SHIP IS ALSO FOR
YOUR FREEDOM CHILDREN WHOWILL RECEIVE THE FINEST
SCHOOLING THAT UNDERPAIDFILL PYNNO DECK HANDS CAN
PROVIDE.
AS PART OF A WORLD STANDARDSYSTEM OF SCHOOLS, FINANCIAL
EDUCATION WILL BE STRESSEDAS EACH AND EVERY CHILD IS
EXPOSED ON A DAILY BASIS TOINTERNATIONAL COMMERCE
ABOARD THE SHIP.
YES, STUDENTS WILL LEARNIMPORTANT BUSINESS CONCEPTS
LIKE NEGOTIATION, CRISISMANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY ONCE
YOU'RE BOARDED BY THE SOMALIPIRATES.
THE WAY I SEE IT, FOLKS,THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS
FROM PREVENTING ME FROMBOARDING TOMORROW.
ONE, FREEDOM SHIP HAS NOTYET BEEN BUILT.
SO IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TOMEASURE THE DRAPES FOR MY
LUXURIOUS FINISHED WALLS.
TWO, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION,FREEDOM SHIP WILL BE SUBJECT
TO INTERNATIONAL MARITIMELAW.
SORRY.
THAT'S TOO MUCH LAW FOR THISGUY.
EVEN IF IT DOES ALLOW ME TOGAMBLE ON WHITE RHINO AND
THEN SNORT THE LOSER.
SO I HAVE, OH WAY, IT WORKS.
THE LEDGE ENS ARE TRUE.
OKAY.
SO I HAVE DEVICED MY OWNESCAPE FOR BILLIONAIRE
EX-PATS.
STEPHEN COLBERT'S LIBERTYDERIDGEABLE.
FINALLY A PLACE WHEREAMERICA'S WEALTHY CAN TAKE
TO THE SKIES, SHATTER THECHAINS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AND FIND THEIR OWN DESTINYAS LONG AS IT IS DOWNWIND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
