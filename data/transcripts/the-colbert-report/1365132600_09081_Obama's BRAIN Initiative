>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY
PRESIDENT OBAMA FINDS A NEW WAY
TO WASTE OUR TAX DOLLARS.
I MEAN TWO DAUGHTERS?
SEEMS A LITTLE REDUNDANT.
WELL NO SURPRISE ADMIRAL
SPENDTHRIFT O-DEEP-POCKETS IS AT
IT AGAIN.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED
CONGRESS TO INVEST $100 MILLION
NEXT YEAR TO HELP UNLOCK THE
MYSTERIES OF THE HUMAN BRAIN.
THE SO-CALLED BRAIN INITIATIVE
PROJECT WOULD MAP BRAIN
FUNCTIONS, WITH THE HOPES OF
EVENTUALLY FINDING CURES FOR
DISORDERS LIKE ALZHEIMER'S AND
EPILEPSY.
WHAT IS THIS?
$100 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A MAP?
THEY GIVE THEM OUT FREE AT LONG
JOHN SILVERS!
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M NOT GOING TO WIN ANY
AWARDS FOR SAYING THIS, BUT
CURING BRAIN DISORDERS?
BUT TRY TELLING THAT TO THE
PRESIDENT'S HYPE MACHINE.
>> WHEN WE INVEST IN THE BEST
IDEAS BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE DOES,
OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR WORKERS
CAN MAKE THE BEST PRODUCTS AND
DELIVER THE BEST SERVICES BEFORE
ANYBODY ELSE.
IDEAS ARE WHAT POWER THE
ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: WRONG!
IDEAS DON'T POWER THE ECONOMY.
IT IS POWERED BY LLOYD BLANKFEIN
STROKING HIS MONKEY PAW!
AND YET OBAMA INSISTS ON CALLING
IT "THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN
PROJECT."
REALLY, SIR?
I REMEMBER WHEN "THE NEXT GREAT
AMERICAN PROJECT" MEANT GOING TO
THE MOON.
HOW HARD IS IT TO GO TO THE
BRAIN?
YOU JUST GRAB AN ICE PICK AND GO
TO TOWN.
[LAUGHTER]
WORK IT AROUND
OH, I REMEMBER SUMMER CAMP.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN OBAMA CAN'T EVEN NAME
STUFF RIGHT.
HIS MAPPING INITIATIVE GOES BY
THE ACRONYM "BRAIN," WHICH
STANDS FOR BRAIN RESEARCH
THROUGH ADVANCING INNOVATIVE
NEUROTECHNOLOGIES.
YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT -- THE B IN
"BRAIN" STANDS FOR BRAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU CAN'T USE THE ACRONYM IN THE
ACRONYM.
THEN WHAT DOES THE B IN THE
BRAIN IN BRAIN STAND FOR?
OR THE B IN THAT BRAIN?
OH MY GOD -- IT NEVER STOPS!!!
MY BRAIN IS HURTING.
AND I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
FINDING OUT WHY!
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, WE KNOW THE GUN REGISTRY
IS JUST A PLOT TO TAKE AWAY OUR
GUNS.
THIS IS JUST A BRAIN REGISTRY.
IT MEANS OBAMA'S COMING FOR OUR
BRAINS!
OH, HE WOULD LOVE TO GET HIS
HANDS ON THIS BEAUTY.
JIMMY, ZOOM IN ON MY BRAIN TO
GIVE THE PRESIDENT A TASTE OF
WHAT HE WILL NEVER HAVE.
GO!
