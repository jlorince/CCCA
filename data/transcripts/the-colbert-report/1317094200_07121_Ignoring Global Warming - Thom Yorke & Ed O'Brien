I SAY IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE
PROBLEM, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.
HERE TO DEFEND NOT SAVING THE
GLOBAL VILLAGE BY DESTROYING IT,
PLEASE WELCOME BACK THOM YORKE
AND ED O'BRIEN.
THOM, ED, THANKS SO MUCH.
THANKS FOR COMING, GUYS.
THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND TO
FIGURE THIS THING OUT.
BY THE WAY, THAT SONG YOU GUYS
JUST DID WAS AWESOME.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS REALLY INCREDIBLE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, GUYS, YOU
HEARD HOW PEOPLE FEEL ACT GLOBAL
WARMING IN THE UNITED STATES
NOW.
JUST IN THE THAT MANY PEOPLE
BELIEVE IT ANYMORE AND THEY
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO
ANYTHING.
WHY DO YOU THINK GLOBAL WARMING
HAS LOST ITS APPEAL TO
AMERICANS?
>> WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT WERE PAID TO SPREAD
DISINFORMATION FOR MANY YEARS.
THEY'RE STILL BEING PAID TO DO
THAT.
>> Stephen: WHO?
THAT'S QUITE AN ACCUSATION, MY
FRIENDS.
>> SCIENTISTS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SCIENTISTS?
SCIENTISTS AND THEIR FRIENDS,
LITTLE BUNNIES?
UP TO 2% OF SCIENTISTS DON'T
BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING.
UP TO 2%.
>> YES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY DON'T
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD?
>> NO, NOT REALLY, NO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT WHY DO YOU TWO CARE ABOUT IT
SO MUCH?
WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO MAKE THIS
SOMETHING THAT INFLUENCED YOUR
BUSINESS DECISIONS.
>> WELL, ON A VERY PRIMAL LEVEL,
WE'VE GOT CHILDREN.
AN YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN AND
THEIR CHILDREN AND YOUR
CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO HAVE A
BETTER PLANET TO LIVE ON.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY IDEA?
I BELIEVE THAT IT JUST ISN'T BAD
ENOUGH, BECAUSE IF IT WERE BAD
ENOUGH, WE'RE IN THE BAD PEOPLE,
WE WOULD TAKE ACTION.
AND IF WE RUN THROUGH THE FOSSIL
FUELS, IF WE LOAD THE SKY WITH
CARBON, THEN IT WILL BE OBVIOUS.
RIGHT NOW YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE
A SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S
GOING ON.
>> NOT IF YOU LIVE IN
BANGLADESH.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON
THERE?
>> IT GETS WET QUITE A LOT
THERE.
>> Stephen: DIDN'T IT ALWAYS
GET WET.
THERE I DON'T MEAN TO BE
FACETIOUS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE WORD "FACETIOUS" MEANS,
BUT IT IS REALLY HARD FROM THOSE
OF US WHO LIVE IN THE UNITED
STATES, AND THERE'S A LOT OF
HIGH GROUND, THERE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S MOTIVATING PEOPLE IN THE
REST OF THE WORLD TO GET WORRIED
ABOUT THIS.
FOR INSTANCE, EUROPEAN, YOU GUYS
ARE FROM WHAT HISTORIANS CALL
EUROPE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY ARE EUROPEANS MORE ATTUNED
TO THIS THAN AMERICANS?
WHY DO YOU GUYS... WHY DO YOU
GUYS BELIEVE IT MORE THAN WE DO?
>> I THINK THAT'S A MYTH.
I MEAN, I THINK THERE'S A BIG
THING WITH THE MEDIA GOING ON
HERE.
IF YOU ASK THOSE PEOPLE IN TEXAS
AFTER THE HOTTEST SUMMER, I'M
SURE MOST PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED,
AS CONCERNED AS EUROPEANS.
>> Stephen: NOT THEIR
GOVERNOR.
>> THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE HE'S MAN
OF FAITH?
>> FAITH, YEAH.
HMMM.
WELL, IT'S... LET'S JUST SAY IN
ORDER TO GET ELECTED YOU NEED TO
HAVE FUNDS, RIGHT, TO... SO YOU
ACCEPT MONEY FROM COMPANIES.
>> Stephen: CORPORATIONS.
THERE'S THAT BAD WORD AGAIN.
>> CORPORATIONS.
SOME OF THE LARGEST ONES ARE OIL
COMPANIES, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S WHAT RUNS THE WORLD IS
OIL.
DID YOU GUYS COME HERE ON AN OX
CART?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, WE NEED... ARE YOU
LIVING AN OIL-FREE LIFESTYLE.
>> UH-UH.
>> Stephen: NO.
DO YOU EVER FEEL GUILTY ABOUT
THE AMOUNT OF OIL YOU USE?
IF YOU BELIEVE IN SAVING THE
ENVIRONMENT, YOU AREN'T
PLAYING... THAT TAKES
ELECTRICITY WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
IT'S GOT TO BE POWERED BY CLEAN
COAL.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'VE HEARD OF CLEAN COAL?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: DO THEY HAVE THAT
IN ENGLAND YET?
>> OH, YEAH, YEAH.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELL, IF YOU
GUYS... WILL YOU STICK AROUND
AND BURN SOME MORE ENERGY AND
PLAY ANOTHER SONG FOR US?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: BEFORE EVEN
THINKING, WHO IS SAVING THE
WORLD BETTER, YOU GUYS OR BONO?
QUICK.
>> DEFINITELY BONO.
>> Stephen: DEFINITELY BONO.
YOU'LL GET THERE.
