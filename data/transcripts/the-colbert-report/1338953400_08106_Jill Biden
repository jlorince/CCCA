(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: HEY, THERE!
WELCOME BACK, FOLKS.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW PATRIOTIC CHILDREN'S BOOK.
FINALLY WE CAN STOP TEACHING OUR KIDS ABOUT THAT SOCIALIST COLLECTIVE DOWN IN WHOVILLE.
(LAUGHTER) PLEASE WELCOME DR. JILL BIDEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DR. BIDEN, THANKS SO MUCH.
I WILL NOT PASS THAT UP.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A BIG GET FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE HAD YOUR HUSBAND, THE PRESIDENT, THE
FIRST LADY, YOU ARE THE LAST PIECE OF MY FOUR-PIECE COLLECTIBLE SET.
(LAUGHTER) AND AS THE LAST YOU MUST BE THE MOST IMPORTANT.
>> I MUST BE, EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE THE HARDEST TO BOOK HERE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: MADAM, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE THE SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHICH DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE SECOND AT BEING A LADY, YOU'RE JUST AS LADY LIKE
AS THE FIRST LADY.
>> EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: JUST DIFFERENT POSITION.
AND YET YOU STILL WORK.
>> I DO!
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE FIRST SECOND LADY TO EVER DO THAT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, I TEACH AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA.
I TEACH ENGLISH.
>> AND... WHY?
>> WELL, BECAUSE I...
>> Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, WHY TEACH ENGLISH?
(LAUGHTER) I'M NOT A FAN OF READING.
>> WELL, I TEACH BECAUSE THAT'S MY PASSION AND POLITICS IS NOT
REALLY MY PASSION SO ONCE WE WERE ELECTED I WAS IN THE CLASSROOM FOUR DAYS AFTER
INAUGURATION AND I SAID TO MY HUSBAND, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO DO... I'VE GOT TO TEACH.
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I LIKE TO DO AND HE SAID "ABSOLUTELY."
SO I'VE BEEN THERE EVER SINCE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: COULDN'T YOU PHONE IT IN AT THIS POINT?
JUST SAY "I DON'T HAVE MY LESSON PLAN TODAY, I'M THE SECOND LADY
OF THE UNITED STATES, DEAL WITH IT."
>> (LAUGHS) ACTUALLY, MANY OF MY STUDENTS DON'T KNOW I'M SECOND LADY OF
THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> NO, BECAUSE IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE...
(AUDIENCE REACTS) I DON'T MEAN IT THAT WAY!
(LAUGHTER) NO, I...
>> Stephen: THE SECRET SERVICE GUYS IN THE FRONT ROW DON'T TIP THEM OFF.
>> WAIT A MINUTE, LET ME GO BACK.
(LAUGHS) IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING,
THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL, THEY'RE RAISING CHILDREN AND, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF TIMES THEY JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO WATCH T.V. TO SEE THAT I'M SECOND LADY.
SO A LOT OF THEM ARE SURPRISED IF THEY SEE ME ON T.V. AND...
WHICH HAS HAPPENED.
AND...
>> Stephen: THEY MIGHT SEE THIS.
>> THEY MIGHT SEE THIS.
AND THEN THEY'LL SAY "WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON REPORT REPORT?
>> Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FRIENDS SAY THAT.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING.
NOW, YOU'VE GOT A NEW CHILDREN'S BOOK CALLED "DON'T FORGET, GOD
BLESS OUR TROOPS." YOU'RE NOT SAYING DON'T FORGET GOD, BLESS OUR TROOPS.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT TELLING GOD WHAT TO DO.
WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO WRITE A CHILDREN'S BOOK.
>> WELL, I FELT AFTER TRAVELING AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND MEETING WITH SO MANY THOUSANDS
OF MILITARY FAMILIES THAT MANY AMERICANS DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE... DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE A MILITARY FAMILY OR THEY EXPERIENCE OR DON'T KNOW HOW RESILIENT AND
STRONG OUR MILITARY FAMILIES ARE.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOUR SON SERVED IN IRAQ, CORRECT?
>> HE DID.
AND ACTUALLY BO WAS IN IRAQ WHEN YOU WENT OVER THERE.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR AUDIENCE KNOWS BUT YOU WERE THERE IN 2009 WHEN MY SON WAS
THERE AND BO TOLD ME HOW MUCH IT MEANT THAT YOU CAME OVER AND THAT ENTERTAINED OUR TROOPS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELL, IT WAS OUR PLEASURE TO DO SO.
OUR PLEASURE TO DO SO.
NOW, I ACTUALLY... I ALSO HAVE A CHILDREN'S BOOK, IT'S CALLED "I
AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU." (LAUGHTER) CAN WE MAKE A DEAL?
CAN WE MAKE A DEAL THAT I TELL PEOPLE... ANYBODY WHO BUYS MY BOOK ALSO BUY THIS BOOK.
ON AMAZON I WANT IT TO SAY "PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT I AM A POLE ALSO BOAT DON'T FORGET, GOD
BLESS OUR TROOPS."
>> OH, YES, THEY GO TOGETHER.
>> Stephen: MY POLE SPENDS A LITTLE TIME AS A STRIPPER POLE.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING SPICY IN THIS OR IS IT ALL... MORE APPROPRIATE?
>> WELL, LET ME JUST SHOW YOU MY POLE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW MY POLE IS A FLAGPOLE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> MY POLE IS A FLAGPOLE, TOO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BUT MY GRANDDAUGHTER NATALIE DO THIS.
>> THIS IS HER STORY ABOUT WHEN HER DAD WAS DEPLOYED.
>> OH, THAT'S LOVELY.
DO YOU LOOK TO ANY OTHER SECOND LADIES FOR INSPIRATION.
FOR INSTANCE, PERHAPS HAPPY ROCKEFELLER OR FLUORIDE CALHOUN FROM THE 1830s.
>> DEFINITELY FLUORIDE.
>> Stephen: SHE'S A BIG INSPIRATION TO US, SHE'S FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> NO, I'M JUST... YOU KNOW, I'M JILL BIDEN AND I'M A MILITARY
MOM, I'M A TEACHER, I'M JUST ME.
SECOND LADY.
CAPTAIN OF THE VICE TEAM.
>> Stephen: CAPTAIN OF THE VASE TEAM?
