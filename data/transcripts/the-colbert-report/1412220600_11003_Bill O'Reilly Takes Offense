>> WELCOME BACK.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS DURING THE COMMERCIALBREAK -- DURING THIS LAST
COMMERCIAL BREAK, I FOUND OUTTHAT I HAVE UPSET SOMEONE VERY
DEAR TO ME.
BILL O'REILLY.
MY MENTOR, MY NORTH STAR,  THEEMERGENCY CONTACT ON MY SOUL
CYCLE MEMBERSHIP.
( LAUGHTER )AND IT HURTS ME TO KNOW I HURT
THE MAN I ADMIRE MOST, JUST ASBILL WOULD BE HURT IF HE HURT
THE MAN HE ADMIRES MOST:HIMSELF.
( LAUGHTER )YOU SEE, LAST THURSDAY, I
PRAISED BILL'S PLAN TO WIN THEWAR ON TERROR WITH AN
INTERNATIONAL ARMY OF 25,000PAID MERCENARIES, MAKING IT
ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE CAST OF"THE EXPENDABLES III."
( LAUGHTER )I LOVED PAPA BEAR'S IDEA OF WAR
WITHOUT POLITICAL RED TAPE SOMUCH, THAT I PUT FORTH
MY OWN EQUALLY-THOUGHT-OUT PLANFROM THE FOURTH GRADE.
AN ARMY OF EXPERT DOUBLE NINJASUPER SOLDIERS WITH LASER
NUNCHUCKS.
IT'S A CAN'T-FAIL STRATEGY.
I DID NOT EVEN INCLUDE THEIRALLIES-- THE PIRATE BOATERCYCLE
GANG.
BUT SOMEHOW, SOMEHOW, FOLKS,BILL O'REILLY TOOK
BILL O'FFENSE.
>> PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN COLBERTMOCKING THE PLAN.
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
BUT BY BEING COMPLETELY VACANT,IT DOESN'T STOP THESE PEOPLE
FROM MOCKING IDEAS THAT MIGHTHAVE SOME VALUE, MIGHT
SOLVE SOME COMPLEX PROBLEMS.
MR. COLBERT AND OTHERS OF HISILK HAVE NO BLEEPIN' CLUE HOW TO
FIGHT THE JIHAD.
>> STEPHEN:  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS!
BILL O'REILLY HAS TO DO HIS OWNBLEEPING?
COME ON, RUPERT MURDOCK.
SPRING FOR THE BLEEP MACHINE!
I'VE GOT ONE.
WATCH: BILL O'REILLY IS A(BLEEP) EGOMANIAC.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )NOW, I'M SURE-- I'M SURE--
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!)
>> I AM POSITIVE-- I AMABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT THAT
WAS BLEEPPEDFOR BROADCAST, BECAUSE I DON'T
MEAN IT.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW CANBILL SAY ME AND OTHERS OF MY ILK
DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO FIGHTJIHAD?
BILL, BABY DOLL, YOU'RE OF MYILK.
BILL, BABY DOLL, YOU'RE OF MYILK.
WE'RE ILK MATES.
WE'RE MEMBERS OF THE SAME ILKLODGE. WE DIP OUR COOKIES IN THE
SAME GLASS OF ILK
I WASN'T MOCKING YOUR PLAN.
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKES ITEVERYONE ON YOUR OWN SHOW
THINKS YOU'RE INSANE.
>> THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA NOT JUST ASA PRACTICAL MATTER BUT AS A
MORAL MATTER.
>> WITH YOUR IDEA YOU'VE GONEFROM OUT OF THE BOX TO OFF THE
WALL.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENTREASONS I OPPOSE THIS.
>> WHAT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY?
>> THERE IS A HIGHLY TRAINEDSKILLED FORCE THAT CAN GO FORTH
IN MANY OF THESE PLACES.
IT'S ALREADY TRAINED BY OURSPECIAL FORCES.
>> IT COULD TURN INTO AFRANKENSTEIN COURSE YOU CAN'T
CONTROL WITH UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCES.
>>>> STEPHEN:  A FRANKENSTEIN
FORCE?
HAS SHE BEEN READING MYNOTEBOOK.
DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE GUYS,BILL, PLENTY OF PEOPLE LOVE YOUR
PLAN.
>> LAST WEEK WE ASKED YOU TOVOTE IN A BILL O'REILLY.COM
POLL.
DO YOU BELIEVE A MERCENARY FORCEPAID FOR BY COALITION NATIONS IS
A GOOD IDEA?
70% YES, 30% NO. ABOUT 20,000 OFYOU VOTED
>> SEE, 70% IN A NONSCIENTIFICPOLL.
THAT MEANS BILL'S MOST LOYALFANS, VOTING AS MANY TIMES AS
THEY WANT, GAVE IT ANOVERWHELMING C-MINUS.
AND TONIGHT, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, I AM PUTTING UP AN
EVENLESS-SCIENTIFIC POLL ON MY
WEBSITE ASKING THE NATION WHOSEPLAN IS BETTER, MINE OR BILL'S.
AND THE RESULTS ARE IN BEFOREI'VE EVEN ASKED-- IT'S THAT
UNSCIENTIFIC.
AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY BOTH GOT100%.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )MEANWHILE-- MEANWHILE, 96 VOTED
"THIS IS A POLL," IN MY"IS THIS A POLL?" POLL.
TOUGH DEFEAT FORRICE CAKES.
AT THAT POINT, I THOUGHT BILLWAS DONE WITH ME.
TURNED OUT, HE WASN'T BLEEPINGFINISHED.
>> IN THE WORLD OF THEIDEOLOGUE WHERE COLBERT LIVES,
SOLUTIONS DON'T REALLY MATTER.
IT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUTTHINGS.
SO IN YOUR LIFE, WHEN YOUCONFRONT A PERSON WHO CRITICIZES
YOU BUT HAS NOTHING CONSTRUCTIVETO SAY, RUN FAST.
>> STEPHEN: EVEN MORE GREATMILITARY ADVICE.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
REMEMBER, REMEMBER, REMEMBER,MERCENARIES WHEN YOU YOU
CONFRONT OPPOSITION, RUN FAST.
I THINK BILL'S THE ONE WHOTRAINED THE IRAQI ARMY.
BUT I'M MAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT THATBILL IS RIGHT.
I AM AN IDEALOGUE, AND THAT'SWHY I'M NOT WORTHY OF HIS
MERCENARY ARMY, BECAUSEMERCENARIES DON'T HAVE IDEOLOGY.
THEY JUST KILL ANYONE YOU PAYTHEM TO.
IN FACT, IF SOMEONE ELSEPAYS THEM MORE, THEY'LL KILL
YOU!
THAT'S JUST THE FREE MARKET.
( APPLAUSE )SO, BILL, PLEASE, I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL.
LET'S NOT FIGHT.
OR IF WE DO FIGHT, BILL, LET'SAT LEAST PAY OTHER PEOPLE TO DO
IT FOR US.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
