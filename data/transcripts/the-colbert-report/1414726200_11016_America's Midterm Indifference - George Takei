NATION, THE MIDTERMS ARE LESSTHAN JUST UNDER A WEEK AWAY, AND
LIKE ME, THE AMERICAN PEOPLECOULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT
THIS ELECTION.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T CAREABOUT MIDTERMS.
>> MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OFVOTERS WILL STAY HOME ON THIS
ELECTION DAY.
>> EVEN ANECDOTALLY, PEOPLE WHOWERE LIFELONG, VERY INVOLVED IN
POLITICS THIS YEAR, ARE JUSTLIKE, "I'M OVER IT."
>> DOES ANYBODY CARE?
>> NOT REALLY.
JUST 15% SAY THEY WERE FOLLOWINGTHE MIDDERM ELECTIONS.
>> THE MIDTERMS-- THEY'RECOMING UP.
YOU KNOW, THE MIDTERMS.
I CAN SEE YOU YAWNING.
>> Stephen: I WASN'T YAWNING.
I WAS SAYING YAAAAY FOR THEMIDTERMS.
ALL THAT INDIFFERENCE HASN'TCOME CHEAP BECAUSE 2014 WILL
BE THE MOST MIDTERMSEXPENSIVE EVER, COSTING $4
BILLION, AND NOBODY IS WATCHING.
IT'S LIKE THE LONE RANGER OFELECTIONS.
I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE WAY,THE PERFECT WAY TO REINVIGORATE
OUR ELECTION PROCESS.
LAST NIGHT, I WAS UP WATCHINGCNN-- I RAN OUT OF AMBIEN.
( LAUGHTER )AND AFTER WATCHING THEM YAMMER
ON ABOUT HOW NOBODY CARES ABOUTTHE MIDTERMS, I FLIPPED OVER TO
A RERUN OF "STAR TREK," ACLASSIC EPISODE CALLED "A TASTE
OF ARMAGEDDON."
EPISODE 23, SEASON 1.
( CHEERS )YEAH, OH, YEAH.
THE GOOD OLD DAYS, BACK BEFOREKIRK'S MISSION WAS TO TRAVEL
UNIVERSE NEGOTIATING CHEAPAIRLINE TICKETS.
NOW, HUGE "STAR TREK" FANS LIKEME, OR AS WE CALL OURSELVES,
"STARRIES," KNOW THAT IN THISEPISODE THE ENTERPRISE IS SENT
TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITHEMINAR VII, A SOCIETY THAT HAS
DEEMED CONVENTIONAL WARFARE TOODESTRUCTIVE AND CONVENTIONAL
HATS TOO NOT-POINTY.
INSTEAD THEY HAVE A COMPUTERSIMULATE WAR AND THEN CALCULATE
THE NUMBER OF DEAD.
CITIZENS REPORTED AS KILLED MUSTSUBMIT THEMSELVES FOR
TERMINATION BY WALKING INTO ADISINTEGRATION BOOTH.
IN THE END, KIRK CONVINCES THESESOCIETIES TO LIVE IN PEACE ALL
FOR THE NOBLE PURPOSE OF BONINGAN ALIEN.
THIS EPISODE, THIS EPISODE ABOUTTWO BITTERLY OPPOSED FACTIONS
DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE OTHERREMINDED ME OF THE MIDTERMS.
THINK OF PARALLELS-- NOBODY WANTTHEMSELVES TO HAPPEN.
THEY'RE COSTING A TON OF MONEY,AND I'M PRETTY SURE LOUIE
GOHMERT IS FERENGI.
I'D SAY-- FOLKS, SAY INSTEAD OFTHE DESTRUCTIVE MESS OF AN
ELECTION, LET'S HAVE COMPUTERSSIMULATE ALL OUR ELECTIONS
FROM NOW ON, AND SELECT THEWINNERS.
NOW, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARESAYING STEPHEN THAT SOUNDS
GREAT, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE $4BILLION?
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL STILL PISS THAT STUFFAWAY.
( LAUGHTER )BECAUSE EVERY ELECTION CYCLE,
THE COMPUTERS WILL ORDER HUGEPILES OF MONEY TO REPORT
DIRECTLY TO THE DISINTEGRATIONMACHINE.
IT WILL SAVE TIME.
YOU WON'T HAVE TO WATCH ANYCAMPAIGN ADS OR PAY ATTENTION TO
THE POLITICS.
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT CHUCKTODD WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO HIS
PREVIOUS JOB AS PUNXSUTAWNEYPHIL.
( LAUGHTER )AND, FOLKS, I HAVE TAKEN-- I
HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE OFBUILDING MY OWN MACHINE--
BEHOLD, THE DISINTEPORTER 6700.
THE MACHINE IS LOADED WITH APILE OF $100 BILLS, AND I, I
WILL NOW DISINTEPORTER THEMONEY.
WHICH MEANS YOU WILL EITHERDISINTEGRATE OR TELEPORT SOME
PLACE ELSE.
I'M NOT SURE.
I LOST THE OWNER'S MANUAL.
EITHER WAY, EITHER WAY, FOLKS,THE MONEY WILL BE GONE, BUT I
CAN'T WATCH.
BECAUSE DURING THE COURSE OFTHIS EPISODE, I BONED THAT
MONEY.
AND...
( CHEERS )>> DON'T DO IT, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: GEORGE TAKEI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?
>> I'M NOT SURE.
I WAS IN THE ELEVATOR ON MY WAYTO ZABARS WHEN I ENDED UP HERE.
BUT, I OVERHEARD YOUR PLAN ANDITS MADNESS.
DON'T DO IT, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: BUT, GEORGE, THISWILL SOLVE ALL OF OUR ELECTION
PROBLEMS AND NO ONE WILL GETHURT.
>> STEPHEN, DEMOCRACY IS ASACRED TRUST.
YES, IT'S A MESSY BUSINESS BUTTHE WILL OF THE PEOPLE MUST NOT
BE ABDICATED TO A MACHINE.
ONLY BY ENGAGING MORE DEEPLY INTHE ISSUES AND VOTING YOUR
CONSCIENCE CAN WE HOPE TO MOVEBEYOND THE ETERNAL GRIDLOCK THAT
THREATENS TO DESTROY OURSOCIETY.
NO MATTER HOW BLEAK THINGS MAYSEEM, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO
CHANGE THEM.
DO YOUR DUTY AS AN AMERICAN, ANDAS A CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY,
VOTE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: I GOTTA SAY, IGOTTA SAY, THOSE ARE POWERFUL
WORDS.
AND DISINTEGRATE.
OH, MY.
WATCH MY DOCUMENTARY "TO BETAKEI," AVAILABLE IN iTUNES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
