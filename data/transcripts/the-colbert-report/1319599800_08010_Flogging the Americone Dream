[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET THAT I
FURIOUSLY OPPOSE OCCUPY WALL
STREET.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO AFFECT
ECONOMIC CHANGE, KIDS, DO IT THE
OLD-FASHIONED WAY-- GET OFF YOUR
ASS AND GET A JOB AT GOLDMAN
SACHS AND THEN GET HIRED BY THE
U.S. TREASURY.
IT'S THAT SIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH!
GIVE IT UP FOR GOLDMAN SACHS.
LLOYD IS A FRIEND.
BUT WHAT REALLY BUNDLES MY ANGER
AND SHORT-SELLS MY RAGE IS THE
LATEST SUPPORTERS OF THESE
BOTTOM 99-PERCENTERS.
JIM?
>>  THE GROUP HAS ITS FIRST SHOW
OF CORPORATE SUPPORT.
BEN AND JERRY'S IS BACKING THE
PROTESTS.
>> BEN AND JERRY'S IS POSTING A
MESSAGE TO PROTESTERS ON THEIR
WEBSITE SAYING, WE STAND WITH
YOU.
>> WE SUPPORT THIS CALL TO
ACTION AND ARE HONORED TO JOIN
YOU IN THIS CALL TO TAKE BACK
OUR NATION AND DEMOCRACY.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
BEN AND JERRY, HOW COULD YOU
SUPPORT THESE LEFTY PROTESTERS?
WHAT'S NEXT, SUPPORTING GAY
MARRIAGE JUST BECAUSE YOUR
HUBBY'S GOT A CHUBBY FOR A
CHUNKY MONKEY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS ENDORSEMENT IMPLIES THAT I
SUPPORT THIS PROTEST, BECAUSE OF
MY BEN & JERRY'S FLAVOR
AMERI-CONE DREAM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO WAY!
MY FLAVOR IS 100% PRO-BUSINESS.
EATING IT IS THE PERFECT WAY TO
INCREASE YOUR BOTTOM LINE.
AS WELL AS YOUR BELLY LINE AND
THE AREA-FORMERLY-KNOWN-AS-CHIN
LINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-1-
HOW DARE YOU LUMP ME IN WITH THE
REST OF YOUR ANTI-CORPORATE
SOCIALIST FLAVORS LIKE WILLIE
NELSON'S COUNTRY PEACH COBBLER.
PHISH FOOD, AND KARAMEL MARX.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT TO MENTION THE FLAVOR OF MY
FORMER BEST FRIEND FOR SIX
MONTHS AND CURRENT ENEMY, JIMMY
FALLON'S LATE NIGHT SNACK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SALTY CARAMEL SWIRL,
FUDGE-COVERED POTATO CHIP
CLUSTERS?
IT'S CLEARLY ANTI-BUSINESS SINCE
THE INGREDIENTS READ LIKE WHAT
AN UNEMPLOYED PERSON FINDS WHEN
DUMPSTER DIVING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS HORRIBLE, BUT AT LEAST I
KNOW THAT MY ICE CREAM IS STILL
THE #1 BEST SELLING BEN AND
JERRY'S FLAVOR.
>> THE BIG ISSUE EVERYONE IS
TALKING ABOUT: IS IT OUTSELLING
STEPHEN COLBERT'S ICE CREAM?
>> YOU KNOW, THE FLAVOR IS DOING
REALLY, REALLY WELL-- BUT THE
SHORT ANSWER IS YES IT'S
OUTSELLING STEPHEN'S ICE CREAM.
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
REALLY, IS IT?
THAT IS SO[AUDIENCE BOOS]
>> Stephen: I'M SO DEPRESSED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M FAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?!?
IN HINDSIGHT, MAYBE DEVOTING AN
ENTIRE SHOW TO THE LAUNCH OF
JIMMY'S ICE-CREAM WAS A MISTAKE.
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
MY FLAVOR IS EVERYWHERE.
IT'S ONE OF ONLY THREE FLAVORS
AVAILABLE IN PINTS,
QUARTS, MINICUPS AND SCOOP
SHOPS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, I SMELL A RAT.
RAT, BY THE WAY, ALSO ONE OF THE
INGREDIENTS IN JIMMY FALLON'S
ICE CREAM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.
JERRY?
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S OUT THERE
FLOGGING HIS FLAVOR THE WAY
YOU'RE FLOGGING YOUR FLAVOR.
IF HE WAS OUT THERE FLOGGING HIS
FLAVOR, HE'D BE PUMPING UP
SALES.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
HEY, I FLOG MY FLAVOR ALL THE
TIME!
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT AS MUCH AS BACK IN COLLEGE,
BUT BELIEVE ME, I CAN STILL PUMP
MY SALES.
LATCH LAUGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NATION, WE MUST REGAIN OUR PLACE
ATOP THE ICE CREAM MOUNTAIN.
I WANT EVERYONE IN THE COLBERT
NATION TO MAKE AMERICONE DREAM
THEIR TREAT OF CHOICE.
BRING IT TO PARTIES, EAT IT ON
YOUR BIRTHDAY, GIVE IT OUT AT
HALLOWEEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF YOU EAT IT.
USE IT TO GREASE DOOR HINGES, OR
SPACKLE WALLS.
OR AS A REFRESHING DEODORANT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND YES, ALL MY ICE CREAM'S
PROCEEDS GO TO CHARITY, BUT TO
HELL WITH THE NEEDY.
I AM DOING THIS TO KICK JIMMY
FALON'S ASS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BY THE WAY, FALLON'S ASS?
ALSO IN HIS ICE CREAM.
