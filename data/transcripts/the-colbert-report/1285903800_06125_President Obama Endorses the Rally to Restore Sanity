NATION, IF YOU'RE THINKING OF
GOING TO JON STEWART'S RALLY TO
RESTORE SANITY, YOU ARE
[BLEEPED] INSANE.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WAS
SUPPOSED TO RESTORE SANITY?
LOBOTOMIES.
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING EVERYONE AT
JON'S RALLY IS GOING TO GET ONE,
BUT I HAVE SEEN HIM STOCKING UP
ON ICE PICKS.
OF COURSE, STEWART'S RALLY MAY
NOT EVEN HAPPEN NOW.
AFTER THE DEVASTATING
ENDORSEMENT HE PICKED UP
YESTERDAY.
>> JON STEWART, THE HOST OF "THE
DAILY SHOW," APPARENTLY HE'S
GOING TO HOST A RALLY CALLED,
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE
AMERICANS IN FAVOR OF RETURN TO
SANITY, YOU KNOW, OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THAT GUY REALLY
KNOWS HOW THE SELL AN IDEA.
BUT FOLKS, FOLKS, I'M NOT
WORRIED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
GETTING ENDORSED BY PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS THE KISS OF DEATH.
LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE HE'S
THROWN HIS WEIGHT BEHIND -- JON
CORZINE, WHO LOST THE CHRIS
CHRISTIE, MARTHA COAKLEY, WHO
LOST TO SCOTT BROWN, AND CHANGE,
WHICH IS LOSING BIG TO SAME.
MEANWHILE, BASED ON THE
ATTENDANCE OF OBAMA'S RECENT
BACKYARD RALLIES, THAT
ENDORSEMENT IS SURE TO BRING JON
DOZEN OF PEOPLE.
MEANWHILE, MILLIONS, MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ARE SURE TO COME TO MY
MARCH TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE ON
