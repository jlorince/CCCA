EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
BOOK ABOUT THE EIGHT RELIGIONS
THAT RUN THE WORLD.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE OTHER FIVE
ARE AFTER CHRISTIAN, JEWISH AND
iPHONE.
PLEASE WELCOME STEPHEN PROTHERO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S PROTHERO, PROTHERO.
>> HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IT,
PROTHERO, RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: HOWEVER I WANT TO
SAY IT?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: NOW, SIR, YOU HAVE A
NEW BOOK HERE CALLED "GOD IS NOT
ONE: THE EIGHT RELIGIONS THAT
RUN THE WORLD AND WHY THEIR
DIFFERENCES MATTER."
SO YOU ADMIT THAT THERE ARE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RELIGIONS,
BECAUSE I HEAR A LOT OF LIKE ALL
ONE PATHS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS OF THE
BOOK IS THAT RELIGIONS ARE NOT
ALL DIFFERENT PATHS UP THE SAME
MOUNTAIN.
>> STEPHEN: NO, THEY AREN'T.
SOME AREN'T GOING UP THE
MOUNTAIN.
SOME ARE GOING DOWN THE
CREVASSE.
>> I LIKE TO THINK THEY'RE GOING
UP DIFFERENT MOUNTAINS.
CHRISTIANS TRY TO GET TO
SALVATION.
THEY TRY TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM
OF SIN, BUT BUDDHISTS TRY THE
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF
SUFFERING AND THEY TRY TO
ACHIEVE NIRVANA.
SO VERY DIFFERENT PATHS, VERY
DIFFERENT GOALS.
>> STEPHEN: BUDDHISTS HAVE
SUFFERING?
>> BUDDHISTS ARE TRYING TO GET
RID OF SUFFERING.
CHRISTIANS AREN'T AIMING TO GET
RID OF SUFFERING.
>> STEPHEN:, NO WE EMBRACE
SUFFERING.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CHRIST ON A
CROSS, INSTEAD OF JUST A
PROTESTANT CROSS, AND I'M ALWAYS
LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED TO JESUS.
WE HAVE CHRIST ON THE CROSS, AND
WE GO, I EMULATE THE SUFFERING
OF CHRIST.
AND THAT'S HOW GOD WANTS US TO
DO IT.
S THAT HOW GOD WANTS EVERYONE TO
DO IT, BY THE WAY.
>> THIS IS THE POINT OF THE
BOOK.
RELIGIONS ARE NOT THE SAME.
THEY'RE NOT EQUAL.
>> STEPHEN: SIR, ARE THEY EQUAL?
ARE RELIGIONS ALL EQUAL IN
>> NEW YORK I DON'T THINK THEY
ARE.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT'S THE BEST ONE?
>> YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PEOPLE
ON THE SHOW TO TELL YOU WHICH IS
THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST AND
THE BEST, BUT THAT'S NOT THE
POINT OF MY BOOK.
THE POINT OF THE BOOK IS TO SAY,
THERE ARE EIGHT DIFFERENT
RELIGIONS GOING ABOUT LOOKING AT
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD, HOW
TO BECOME A HUMAN BEING IN VERY
DIFFERENT WAYS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
OF ISLAM?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH ISLAM?
>> THE PROBLEM WITH ISLAM IS
PRIDE.
SO WE THINK WE CAN LIVE IN A
SELF-SUFFICIENT WAY WITHOUT GOD
AND WE NEED TO SUBMIT TO GOD.
THAT'S WHAT ISLAM MEANS.
IT DOESN'T MEAN PEACE.
IT MEANS SUBMISSION.
WE NEED TO BOW DOWN AND PRAY
FIVE TIMES A DAY.
>> STEPHEN: HINDU, WHAT'S THEIR
PROBLEM?
>> WE KEEP GETTING REBORN OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
THAT'S HORRIBLE.
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, WHICH
IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM
CHRISTIANITY WHERE THE GOAL IS
TO BE BORN AGAIN.
HINDUS HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT
PROBLEM THEY'RE ATTACKINGEN CON
FEW SHANS ARE TRYING TO DEAL
WITH THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL
ORDER.
WE HAVE DISORDER IN SOCIETY AND
WE CAN CREATE SOCIAL ORDER
THROUGH ETIQUETTE, PROPRIETY AND
RITUALS.
>> THE DOWISTS, WHAT'S THEIR
DEAL?
>> THE DOWISTS ARE TRYING TO
HAVE A LIFE THAT'S REALLY ALIVE.
THE IDEA IS CON FEW SHANS ARE
TELLING YOU, DO ALL THIS EMPTY
RITUAL AND ETIQUETTE.
IT MAKES YOU FEEL STILTED.
THEY WANT TO LIVE A LIFE THAT'S
NATURAL AND FREE.
>> STEPHEN: SO IS DOW ITCH A
RESPONSE TO CON FEW SHANISM?
>> IT IS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT HINDU AND
BUDDHISM?
>> HINDUISM COMES EARLIER AND
BUDDHISM COMES AFTER THAT.
>> STEPHEN: WAS THAT A RESPONSE
TO HINDUISM?
>> PRETTY MUCH.
>> STEPHEN: IS BUDDHISM TO
HINDUISM AS CHRISTIANITY IS TO
JUDAISM?
>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: WE'LL GO WITH YES.
>> WE'LL GO WITH YES IN THE
SENSE THAT IT CAME AFTER, BUT IN
JUDAISM FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ISN'T
THIS IDEA OF SIN THAT WE HAVE IN
CHRISTIANITY.
>> STEPHEN: ADAM AND EVE.
ADAM AND EVE WERE JEWISH.
CHECK UNDER THE FIG LEAVES, MY
FRIEND.
>> CHRISTIANS UNDERSTAND THAT
STORY AS A STORY OF SIN, BUT
IT'S UNDERSTOOD DIFFERENTLY IN
THE JEWISH TRADITION.
THERE ISN'T THIS PROBLEM OF
ORIGINAL SIN IN JUDAISM.
YOU DON'T NEED THE SAVIOR TO
COME DOWN AND DIE ON THE CROSS
AND TAKE AWAY OUR SINS.
IT'S A DIFFERENT PROBLEM THAN
WHEN WE'RE EXILED FROM GOD AND
WE'RE EXILED FROM ONE ANOTHER.
WE WANT TO RETURN TO ONE
ANOTHER.
>> STEPHEN: SO WHY DID YOU WRITE
THE BOOK?
>> I WROTE THE BOOK BECAUSE
RELIGIONS ARE HORRIBLY
MISUNDERSTOOD.
THEY'RE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT IN
THE WORLD, BUT WE HAVE ATHEISTS
SAYING ALL THE RELIGIONS ARE THE
SAME AND BAD.
AN WE HAVE MULTICULTURISTS WHO
ARE SAYING ALL THE RELIGIONS ARE
THE SAME AND GOOD.
I DON'T THINK THE IDEA THAT THE
RELIGIONS ARE ALL THE SAME
SERVES TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD.
THE WORLD IS FURIOUSLY
RELIGIOUS.
WE HAVE ALL THESE RELIGIONS THAT
ARE VERY INFLUENTIAL.
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND CHINA
WITHOUT CON FEW SHUNNISM.
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE MIDDLE
EAST WITH UNDERSTANDING JUDAISM,
ISLAM AND...
>> STEPHEN: WHO IS WINNING?
>> I THINK ISLAM IS WINNING, I
HATE TO SAY.
I LIST THE RELIGIONS IN TERMS OF
THEIR MARKET SHARE, BUT
CHRISTIANITY IS LOSING.
>> STEPHEN: JESUS ALWAYS WINS IN
THE END.
HE LOVED TO RUN UP THE ODDS.
HE LET THEM THINK HE HAD THEM ON
THE ROPES.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> STEPHEN: THREE DAYS LATER,
HE'S BACK, THEY CLEAN UP AT THE
TABLE.
>> SO RIGHT NOW THAT MAY BE THE
CASE, AND THAT WILL BE THE CASE
FOREVER AFTER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
