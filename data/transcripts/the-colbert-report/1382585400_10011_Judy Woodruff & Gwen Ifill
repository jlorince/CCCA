>> SEE, THAT'S THE THING.
WE NEVER RUN OUT OF TIME.
>> Stephen: BUT HERE'S THEPROBLEM WITH YOU TWO IS THAT
YOU'RE VERY LEVEL HEADED.
I GET INFORMATION FROM YOU.
WHEN I WATCH THE NEWS I'MLOOKING FOR EMOTION.
WHICH OF YOU IS GOING TO BE THECONSERVATIVE, WHICH ONE IS GOING
TO BE THE LIBERAL AND WHAT AREYOU GOING TO BE FIGHTING OVER?
>> IF YOU WANT FIGHTING AND YOUWANT OPINION THERE ARE LOTS OF
PLACES TO GO.
OUR VIEW, STEPHEN, IS THAT OURVIEWERS ARE SMART AND CURIOUS SO
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEMINFORMATION AND LET THEM MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MINDS.
>> I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ONCOLLEGE CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS
SAY TO ME "I ONLY WATCH COLBERT"OR "I ONLY WATCH JON STEWART"
AND THEN I TELL THEM YOU GUYSWATCH US TO FIND OUT WHAT'S
REAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: I DO, I DO WATCH YOU
GUYS BECAUSE I'M HOPING YOU'LLTAKE MY SUGGESTION OF HAVING
MARK SHIELDS AND DAVID BROOKSFIGHT IN A PIT.
(LAUGHTER)THAT WOULD BE EXCITING.
>> I CAN TELL THEM.
>> Stephen: MODERN BEAR-BAITING.
YOU GUYS HAVE BOTH BEEN IN THENEWS FOR A LONG TIME.
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S CHANGED?
YOU SEEM TO HAVE AN OLDER MODELOF NEWS THAT IS NEWS AS
INFORMATION NOT NEWS ASENTERTAINMENT.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S OLD.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, LOOK, WEBELIEVE THAT VIEWERS ARE SMART,
THEY CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWNMINDS.
I THINK THAT'S A NEW IDEA.
I THINK FRANKLY BECAUSE MOST OFWHAT -- MUCH OF WHAT YOU SEE ON
TELEVISION TODAY IS ABOUTOPINION.
>> Stephen: OPINION IS ALSO AGREAT PENNY-PINCHER BECAUSE YOU
DON'T TO BACK OPINION UP WITHANYTHING.
(LAUGHTER)WE DO THIS SHOW FOR $1.29 AN
EPISODE.
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS CHEAPER PER POUND THAN
GREEN BEANS.
I CAN JUST MAKE UP ALL THE FACTSI WANT.
YOU GUYS, DO YOU FACT CHECK THETHINGS YOU'LL BE TELLING US?
>> WELL, WHEN WE ASK FOR MONEYTHAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY TO
GET THE NEWS.
IT'S A NOVEL IDEA THAT WE HAVETO GO GET THE NEWS AND BRING IT
BACK AND THEN LET PEOPLE DECIDE.
>> Stephen: THAT BRINGS ME TOANOTHER PROBLEM.
YOU GUYS ARE IN THE POCKET OFBIG DO NATEORS.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE YOU GUYS GET YOUR MONEY
FROM VIEWERS -->> VIEWERS LIKE YOU.
>> Stephen: VIEWERS LIKE YOU.
EXACTLY.
BUT WHAT IF VIEWERS LIKE THEMHAVE A SCANDAL.
WILL YOU BE REPORTING ON VIEWERSLIKE THEM KNOWING THAT THEY
COULD PULL THE FUNDING ON YOURSNOW.
>> IF IT'S A SCANDAL THAT WETHINK AFFECTS -- MOST PEOPLE IN
THE COUNTRY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT,SURE
>> WHEN B.P. WAS DUMPING OILINTO THE GULF, THEY WERE ONE OF
OUR UNDERWRITERS AND EVERY NIGHTWE WOULD SAY "B.P. IS MANY OF
OUR UNDERWRITERS, NOW LET METELL YOU HOW MANY BARRELS OF OIL
WENT INTO THE GULF TODAY."
IT DIDN'T STOP US FROM COVERINGTHE STORY BUT IT ALLOWED US TO
COVER THE STORY.
>> Stephen: DO THEY STILLUNDERWRITE YOUR SNOW
>> NO, ACTUALLY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: INTERESTING.
INTERESTING.
INTERESTING.
ALL RIGHT, NOW I'M THRILLED THATWE HAVE TWO FEMALE ANCHORS
FINALLY GIVING US THE NEWS BUT,OF COURSE, LIKE THE HIGHLANDER,
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE.
HOW WILL YOU ACTUALLY BACK STABEACH OTHER AND BECOME THE ONLY
ANCHOR.
>> YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO DOTHAT.
>> Stephen: I KNOW YOU DON'TWANT TO BUT IT'S AN UGLY
BUSINESS.
ARE YOU GUYS FRIENDS?
>> YES.
>> WE ARE FRIENDS, WE LIKE EACHOTHER.
WE RESPECT EACH OTHER.
AND LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, STEPHENTHINK HOW FAR THE COUNTRY HAS
COME JUST USING HALF OF ITSTALENT.
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH FARTHER WECAN GO IF WE USE ALL OF THE
TALENT.
IF WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO DO WHATMEN HAVE DONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BUT AM I
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET MY MANNEWS WHEN I CHECK IN WITH THE
LADIES?
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I REPORTED ONWHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT BETWEEN
A LION AND A TIGER.
I DON'T THINK A WOMAN WOULDREPORT ON THAT.
I BROKE THAT STORY, JUDY.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I FWLEK STORY.
>> HERE'S THE THING.
WHEN WE GOT THIS JOB WE THOUGHTIT WAS A NATURAL PROGRESSION FOR
US.
AND WE WERE SURPRISED AND TAKENABACK BY HOW MANY WOMEN--
ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN-- REACTEDEMOTIONALLY ABOUT THE IDEA THAT
WE ARE SITTING IN THESE CHAIRSSO I DON'T KNOW YOU, JUDY, BUT I
FEEL LIKE I'VE TAKEN IT MORESERIOUSLY SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE
CHAIR BECAUSE I DID BEFORE.
