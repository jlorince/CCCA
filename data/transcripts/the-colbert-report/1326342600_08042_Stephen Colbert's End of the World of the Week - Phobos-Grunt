EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, I KNOW THAT AS A
JOURNALIST IT IS MY JOB TO KEEP
YOU TERRIFIED.
IF YOU'RE NOT WATCHING THE SHOW
RIGHT NOW WITH A LOAD IN YOUR
PANTS, I'VE DROPPED THE BALL.
WELL, FOLKS, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD
NEWS, THERE'S TERRIBLE NEWS,
WHICH BRINGS ME TO TONIGHT'S
EDITION OF "STEPHEN COLBERT'S
END OF THE WORLD OF THE WEEK."
NATION, IF YOU LIKE ME, SOME
NIGHTS YOU JUST LAY ON YOUR BACK
LOOKING UP AT THE STARS AND
WONDER, WHEN THE HELL IS THAT
CONTRACTOR GOING TO FINISH
PATCHING MY ROOF.
BUT NOW IT TURNS OUT THE SKY
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE FALLING.
CHICKEN LITTLE TRIED TO WARN US,
BUT WE WOULD MOTT LISTEN.
INSTEAD WE PUT HIM ON XANEX.
THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF A
PLUMMETING RUSSIAN SPACECRAFT
KNOWN AS FOBAS HUH.
I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT
CORRECTLY.
RUSSIAN IS A STRANGE LANGUAGE.
THE SPACECRAFT WAS USED TO
EXPLORE ONE OF MARS' MOON, USING
THE RUSSIAN METHOD OF OPENING UP
AND DEPLOYING CONTINUALLY
SMALLER VERSIONS OFIST.
[LAUGHTER]
THE SPACECRAFT STALLED BEFORE
LEAVING EARTH'S ORBIT.
, WHICH MEANS SENSE.
AFTER ALL, IT COMS FROM THE LAND
OF STALL-IN.
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.
SO THIS RUSE I CAN SATELLITE IS
HURDLING BACK TO EARTH THIS
WEEKEND WITH ITS FULL FUEL LOAD
OF 8.
3 TONS OF HYDROZINE, WHICH IS
HIGHLY TOXIC, EXTREMELY
UNSTABLE, CORROSIVE TO THE SKIN
AND EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO
PULMONARY EDEMA, SEIZURES, COMAS
OR DEATHS.
SO IN RUSSIA THEY USE IT TO
WATER DOWN THEIR VODKA.
SO JUST WHERE IS THIS MOLOTOV
COCKTAIL OF DOOM HEADED?
ACCORDING TO EXPERTS, DEBRIS
COULD FALL ANYWHERE ALONG A VAST
STRETCH OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE
THAT INCLUDES THE CITIES OF NEW
YORK, LONDON AND TOKYO.
NEW YORK, LONDON AND TOKYO.
I WOULD HATE FOR IT TO LAND ON
ONE OF THOSE CITIES.
AND LOVE FOR IT TO LAND ON THE
OTHER TWO.
NOW, SCIENTISTS WILL SAY THERE'S
VERY LITTLE CHANCE THAT THE
PLUMMETING DEBRIS COULD CAUSE
ANY HARM, BUT I AM NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES, FOLKS.
THAT IS WHY I WILL BE SPENDING
THE ENTIRE WEEKEND WEARING MY
PATENTED SPACE DEBRIS REPELLING
HAT.
OKAY.
IT HAS A MINITRAMPOLINE UP TOP
THAT SHOULD RAPPEL ANY SHATTERED
OF HYPERSONIC SPACE METAL TO
COME MY WAY.
THIS IS THE SPACE METAL, THIS
KOOSH BALL.
BETA TESTING COMPLETE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, I MAY NOT... I'M NOT
SURE I'M GOING THE WANT THIS
LEVEL OF PROTECTION.
OUCH.
[BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
SOMETIMES FASHION IS PAINFUL.
I MAY NOT WANT THAT KIND OF
PROTECTION BECAUSE THERE IS A
CHANCE THAT THIS HUNK OF DEBRIS
COULD DO SOMETHING COOL LIKE
CONTAIN MUTATING SPACE RAYS THAT
CAN TRANSFORM ME ENTER A
SUPERHERO, LIKE GAMMA RADIATION
THAT WOULD TURN ME INTO THE HULK
OF YO GAMMA GAMMA RADIATION.
THAT'S IT FOR THAT WEEK'S
STEPHEN COLBERT'S END OF THE
WORLD OF THE WEEK.
TUNE IN NEXT WEEK TO FIND OUT
WHAT WILL KILL US ALL.
I'M GOING TO
