>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WHOO!THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, IF
YOU'VE WATCHED THIS SHOW NIGHTAFTER NIGHT FOR NINE YEARS, AND
I HOPE YOU HAVE
I BELIEVE IN GIVING YOU THEWHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT
THE TRUTH, AS LONG AS YOU DON'TASK ABOUT THE SHED IN MY YARD.
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FIRST UP, WITH REPUBLICANS SET
TO TAKE OVER CONGRESS INJANUARY, I HAVE BEEN APPALLED TO
SEE BARACK OBAMA BRAZENLYSTILL BEING PRESIDENT.
CASE IN EXECUTIVE OVERREACH,THIS WEEKEND, HE NAMED HIS
CHOICE TO SUCCEED ATTORNEYGENERAL ERIC HOLDER.
>> PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAANNOUNCES HE WANTS U.S. ATTORNEY
LORETTA LYNCH TO TAKE OVER THEJUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
55-YEAR-OLD LYNCH WOULD BE THEFIRST BLACK WOMAN TO HOLD THE
POST OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.
>> SHE HAS SPENT YEARS IN THETRENCHES AS A PROSECUTOR
AGGRESSIVELY FIGHTING TERRORISM,FINANCIAL FRAUD, CYBERCRIME, ALL
THE WHILE VIGOROUSLY DEFENDINGCIVIL RIGHTS.
>> I WILL WAKE UP EVERY MORNINGWITH THE PROTECTION OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE MY FIRSTTHOUGHT.
>> Stephen: HER FIRST WAKINGTHOUGHT IS PROTECTING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE?
APPARENTLY, SHE'S GOT BETTERTHINGS TO DO WHILE SHE'S ASLEEP.
(LAUGHTER)   OH, I'M SORRY.
I GUESS SHE'S TOO BUSY RIDING AUNICORN TO A TEST THAT SHE'S
LATE FOR NAKED.
FOLKS, THAT FACT IS LYNCH SIMPLYISN'T QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB
I READ ALL ABOUT IT OVER THEWEEKEND, WHEN BRIETBART.GOV
JOURNALIST AND WILFORD BRIMLEYTRIBUTE HEAD, WARNER TODD
HUSTON, BLEW THE LID OFF THESCANDAL THAT LYNCH WAS "A PART
OF BILL CLINTON'S WHITEWATERPROBE DEFENSE TEAM IN 1992".
KIDS, IF YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TOREMEMBER, WHITEWATER WAS THE
BENGHAZI OF ARKANSAS REALESTATE.
(LAUGHTER)THE BOMBSHELL DESTROYS LORETTA
LYNCH'S CREDIBILITY TO BEATTORNEY GENERAL, IF IT WERE
TRUE.
BUT IT TURNS OUT, TEDDYROOSEVELT HERE HAD THE WRONG
LORETTA LYNCH.
THIS IS THE ATTORNEY GENERALNOMINEE.
THIS IS THE ONE WHO DEFENDEDCLINTON DURING WHITEWATER.
AND THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO TELLTHESE TWO WOMEN APART.
(LAUGHTER)BUT AS SOON AS WALRUS-MAN
NOTICED THE MISTAKE, BRIETBARTISSUED A CORRECTION BY LEAVING
UP THE SAME HEADLINE AND ADDINGTHE WORD "CORRECTED."
FROM THERE, IT'S THE EXACT SAMEARTICLE ABOUT HOW OBAMA'S
LORETTA LYNCH DEFENDED THECLINTONS UNTIL YOU GET TO THE
VERY BOTTOM OF THE ARTICLE,WHERE IT READS, "CORRECTION: THE
LORETTA LYNCH IDENTIFIED EARLIERAS THE WHITEWATER ATTORNEY
WAS, IN FACT, A DIFFERENTATTORNEY."
(LAUGHTER)SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT
TO BREITBART FOR BREAKING THISNEWS, FINDING
OUT IT'S BROKEN, BUT STICKINGWITH THE STORY ANYWAY.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE NO MATTER WHO SHE
ACTUALLY IS, I STILL STANDAGAINST THE NOMINATION OF
LORETTA LYNCH.
I JUST DON'T THINK A COALMINER'S DAUGHTER HAS ANY PLACE
AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.
(LAUGHTER)PLUS, WHY ISN'T ANYONE TALKING
ABOUT THE TIME SHE STOLECHRISTMAS?
IT'S SCANDALOUS!
(LAUGHTER)SO I SALUTE BREITBART FOR NOT
TAKING DOWN A HEADLINE THAT YOUKNOW IS FALSE.
YOU ARE CRAVEN POLITICAL HATCHETMEN.
OH, THEY EVENTUALLY TOOK ITDOWN?
MY APOLOGIES.
THEY ARE CRAVEN POLITICALHATCHET MEN.
CORRECTED.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
