>> Stephen:  THANK YOU SOMUCH.
THANK YOU.
YOU FOLKS, YOU FOLKS AT HOMECAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ABOUT THE
THINGS WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGHTONIGHT ALREADY.
[LAUGHTER]THIS IS A STRESSFUL JOB, I'M
NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU.
SO WHEN I'M NOT OUT HERESPITTING THE TRUTH HOT AND HARD,
I RELAX BY GAMING.
I'M A HUGE GAMER, I PLAY THEMALL, MONOPOLY, GO FISH.
SAYING I'LL MEET YOU THERE BUTTHEN IT TURNS OUT I
HAVE A THING AND I DON'T SHOWUP. I WIN.
I ALSO LOVE GAMES OF THE VIDEONATURE.
I'VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURSPLAYING DARK SOULS, ASSASSIN'S
CREED, CALL OF DUTY.
WHICH IS WHEN I PAUSE ASSASSIN'SCREED AND GO USE THE BATHROOM.
[APPLAUSE]HIGH SCORE.
NEW HIGH SCORE LAST NIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
AS A GAMESMAN, I AM GRIPPED BY ASCANDAL CALLED GAMERGATE THAT'S
SHAKEN THE VIDEO WORLD.
YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF THE TERMGAMERGATE.
I HAVE.
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT UP JUSTNOW.
[LAUGHTER]>> WHAT IS IT ABOUT.
IT IS A SCANDAL ABOUT GAMING ANDSEXISM THAT'S NOW MADE
FRONT PAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
ONE MILLION TWEETS AND COUNTINGTO THE GAMERGATE HASHTAG. IT'S
AN ONLINE BATTLE OF THE SEXESOVER HOW GAMERS ARE PORTRAYED
IN THE SOMETIMES VIOLENTREACTION TO WOMEN WHO SPEAK OUT.
>> Stephen:  YES, GAMERGATENAMED AFTER WATERGATE WHEN A
COVERT GROUP KNOWN AS THEPLUMBERS WERE CAUGHT
SPYING FOR THE WHITEHOUSE.
AT LEAST IN GAMERGATE WE KNOWWHO THE PLUMBERS ARE.
[LAUGHTER]AS THE TV MAN SAID, GAMERGATE
INVOLVES SOME MALE GAMERSHARASSING WOMEN WHO ARE
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE PORTRAYALOF WOMEN IN VIDEO GAMES
PRESUMING AFTER THE INITIALSHOCK
THAT WOMEN WERE EVEN SPEAKING TOTHEM AT ALL.
[CROWD CHEERING][APPLAUSE]
LEADING THE CHARGE IS MEDIACRITIC AND WORLD OF WAR CRAFT
TRIBUTE NAMED  ANITA SARKEESIAN,WHO THINKS THE CURRENT
GENDER ROLES IN VIDEO GAMESMEGA-BITE. JIM?
>>  FEMINIST CRITIC ANITASARKEESIAN HAS CONDEMNED
STEREOTYPES AND ABUSE OF WOMENIN VIDEO GAMES SUCH AS DRAGON
AGE ORIGINS.>> LET GO OF ME!
>> IT'S A PARTY, ISN'T IT? GRABA WHORE AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
>> WOMEN ARE OFTEN A DAMSEL INDISTRESS, OR HELPLESS IN
SOME WAY OR HIGHLY SEXUALIZEDAND SORT OF CREATED TO BE THESE
MALE FANTASIES.
>> Stephen: YES, VIDEO GAMES ARELOADED WITH MALE FANTASY
STEREOTYPES LIKE ALL THEGIRLS IN DEAD OR ALIVE,
TIFA LOCKHART FROM FINAL FANTASY7 AND MS. PACMAN. SHE CAN
GOBBLE MY GHOST ANY TIME.
[LAUGHTER]GAMERGATERS SAY THAT THE SCANDAL
IS REALLY ABOUT SOMETHING CALLEDETHICS AND VIDEO GAME JOURNALISM
AND CLAIM COLLUSION BETWEENCRITICS LIKE SARKEESIAN, FEMALE
DEVELOPERS AND THE MEDIA TOFAVOR SOFTER MORE FEMALE
FRIENDLY GAME WHERE IN THIS ONEGAME YOU PLAY A GUST OF WIND.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THATGUST OF WIND?
BLOW ME.
[LAUGHTER]NOW ACCORDING TO NEWS WEEK, THE
ORIGINAL CLAIM THAT STARTED ALLTHIS, COLLUSION BETWEEN ONE
DEVELOPER AND ONE REVIEWERWASN'T TRUE.
BUT THE FIRE WAS LIT AND THEFLAME WARS BEGAN.
>> IT IS A GROUP OF MALE GAMERSWHO ARE ATTACKING WOMEN.
>> THREATS OF DEATH AND OFSEXUAL VIOLENCE.
>> BOMB, RAPE AND DEATH THREATSFROM ON-LINE HARASSERS
>> GAME DEVELOPER BRIANNA WUWENT INTO HIDING OVER THE
WEEKEND AFTER RECEIVING DEATHTHREATS LIKE THESE.
YOU JUST MADE A  BLANK GAMENOBODY LIKES.
THAT'S IT NOBODY WILL CARE WHENYOU DIE.
>> Stephen:  AS OPPOSED TOON-LINE TROLLS, THEIR DEATHS
LEAD TO WIDESPREAD CELEBRATION.
BUT GAMERGATERS SAY THEY HAVEBEEN HARASSED TOO,
ESPECIALLY ONCE THE MEDIA SAWWHAT THEY WERE SAYING TO THESE
WOMEN. GAMERS HAVE COMPLAINEDABOUT
ANTI-GAMER, ANTI-NERD BULLYINGFOR FOLLOWING THEIR TRADITIONAL
GAMER LIFE-STYLE.
YES, THERE'S A TRADITIONAL GAMERLIFE-STYLE.
GOD ORDAINED IT IS ONE MAN, ONEJOY STICK.
READ YOUR BIBLE.
[APPLAUSE]READ YOUR BIBLE, FOLKS.
[APPLAUSE]IT'S RIGHT THERE IN SEGA GENESIS
.
WELL NO MATTER, NO MATTER WHATALL THESE FEMINIST CRITICS SAY,
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF MY HOBBYTHAT'S WHY I DO IT ALONE IN MY
BASEMENT.
BECAUSE NEWS FLASH WHAT I DO INA VIDEO GAME DOESN'T REFLECT THE
WAY I ACT IN THE REAL WORLD.
I LOVE MARIO KART BUT I DON'T GOAROUND THROWING BANANA PEELS OUT
OF MY CAR.
BECAUSE TURTLE SHELLS ARE MUCHMORE EFFECTIVE.
