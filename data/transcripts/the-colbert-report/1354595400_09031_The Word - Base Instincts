NATION, I LOVE NEW YORK CITY.
THE BIG APPLE, THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS, RAT XANADU.
SO I WAS CRUSHED TO LEARN THE METROPOLIS I KNOW AND LOVE HAS CHANGED, NOT ONE PERSON WAS MURDERED IN NEW
YORK CITY ON MONDAY.
NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PAUL BROWN COULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME A DAY WENT BY WHERE NOT ONE PERSON
WAS SHOT, STABBED OR SLASHED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED?
I REMEMBER THE REAL NEW YORK OF THE '80s, WHEN IN A SINGLE NIGHT YOU COULD SCORE
SOME WEED, CATCH A TIMES SQUARE PORNO AND THEN GET STABBED IN THE NECK BY A COKED-UP LOU REED.
AND THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD FIRST DATEMENT NOW TIMES SQUARE HAS BECOME A DISNEY BUBBA GUMP WIMP COMPANY.
THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN IS ONE OF THOSE GIANT M & Ms TRIES TO FLASH YOU ITS PEANUT.
WHERE IS THE THRILLING DANGEROUS CITY OF MIDNIGHT COWBOY OR TAXI DRIVER?
>> YOU TALKING TO ME?
>> Stephen: I WISH I WAS TALKING TO YOU.
(LAUGHTER) INSTEAD OF I'M TALKING TO HER.
SUPERCALIFRAGISLISTICEXPIALI -- SUPERCALIFRAGISLISTICEXPIALI
[BLEEP] ME.
FOLK, I'VE HAD IT, HAD IT.
THIS DISTURBING LACK OF VIOLENCE IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR OUR CITY T IS A PROBLEM FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
IN THIS LAST ELECTION THEY LOST THE BLACKS.
THEY LOST THE WOMEN, THEY LOST YOUNG VOTERS.
THEY LOST LATINOS BY 44%.
EVEN MORE SURPRISING THEY FAILED IT TO GET 100% OF THE WHITE MALE VOTE.
BUT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO TURN THE VOTER TIDE IN THE GOP'S FAVOR AND IT BRINGS US
TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BASE INSTINCT.
NOW, FOLK, THE CLIMBING STREET VIOLENCE MAY SEEM LIKE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT TO SOME.
BUT AS "THE WASHINGTON POST" CHARLES LANE RECENTLY WROTE FEAR OF STREET CRIME ONCE
CONVERTED MANY A WHITE WORKING CLASS DEMOCRAT INTO A REPUBLICAN.
BUT SAFER STREETS HAVE NOW BLUNTED WHAT WAS ONCE A SHARP WEDGE ISSUE.
AND FOLKS, WITHOUT CRIME THE GOP'S ONLY REMAINING WEDGE ISSUES ARE GAY MARRIAGE,
IMMIGRATION, FLAG BURNING, VOTER FRAUD, WELFARE, GUN CONTROL AND OF COURSE CONTRACEPTION.
NOW IN THE GOOD OLD--  (LAUGHTER) IN THE GOOD OLD BAD DAYS OF THE '80s REPUBLICANS COULD
TURN OUT THE SUBURBAN WHITE VOTE SIMPLY BY SHOWING IMAGES OF SCARY GUYS LIKE WILLIE HORTON BEING ALLOWED
TO GO IN AND OUT OF PRISON.
TO THIS DAY I'M TERRIFIED TO GO THROUGH A REVOLVING DOOR.
(LAUGHTER) NOW GETTING-- TOUGH ON CRIME WAS A KEY CONSERVATIVE ISSUE THAT IS GONE.
AND WORSE, IT'S THE CONSERVATIVE'S OWN DAMN FAULT.
TAKE RUDY GIULIANI.
THE REPUBLICAN TOUGH ON CRIME NEW YORK MAYOR WHO CRACKED DOWN ON TURNSTILE JUMPERS, BROKEN WINDOWS AND
SQUEEGEE GUYS.
SQUEEGEE GUYS WITHOUT CURIOUSLY DISAPPEARED RIGHT BEFORE THE OPENING OF NEW YORK'S BODY EXHIBITS.
(LAUGHTER) UNFORTUNATELY, UNFORTUNATELY IT, WITHOUTED TOO WELL.
NOW THE RIGHT IS BEING PUNISHED FOR ITS OWN SUCCESS.
LIKE DENTISTS WHO GAVE US FLUORIDE AND TO YOU DON'T HAVE CAVITIES TO FILL OR MY
TEACH A MAN TO FISH SEAFOOD RESTAURANT.
NO ONE EVER COMES BACK.
WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO SCARE WHITE VOTERS INTO VOTING REPUBLICAN.
SO TONIGHT--  (LAUGHTER)
>> TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM CALLING ON ALL OF AMERICA'S DISENFRANCHISED MINORITIES
TO VIOLENTLY RISE UP AGAINST THE WHITE MALE PATRIARCHY THAT IS KEEPING YOU DOWN.
IT IS TIME TO STICK IT TO THE MAN.
AND I SHOULD KNOW, I'M THE MAN.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN LOOK-- LOOK-- LOOK AT EVERYTHING I HAVE.
YOU SEE THIS iPAD?
SEE THIS iPAD RIGHT HERE, I GOT IT FOR FREE.
AND MY FREE iPAD HAS ITS OWN FREE MINIiPAD WHICH HAS ITS OWN FREE iPHONE 5, WHICH HAS
A FREE NANO, WHICH HAS ITS OWN FREE SHUFFLE.
I CAN AFFORD ALL THIS BUT I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
DOESN'T THAT JUST MAKE YOU WANT TO BLUFERJON ME WITH A CHAIR LEG UNTIL I BURST OPEN
LIKE A CASH PINATA?
MEANWHILE--  (APPLAUSE) MEANWHILE DOWN TRODEN, YOUR FUTURE PROSPECTS ARE PRETTY DIM.
I MEAN HAVE YOU HEARD THE COMING CUTS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION OR FOOD STAMPS?
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE CUTS TO MEDICAID?
AND FOLKS, LET ME TELL YOU, THE RICH JUST GET RICHER.
SO REALLY MUGGING AN OLD COUPLE OUTSIDE THE OPERAHOUSE IS A FORM OF JUSTICE.
I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT--  (LAUGHTER) ULTIMATELY ALL OF IN IS SOCIETY'S FAULT AND I SAY
IT'S PAY BACK TIME.
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT PUT YOU IN THE MIND-SET FOR MAYHEM?
NICE BIG BAG OF METH.
HMMMM, SOME OF THE TASTY BLUE, GO NUTS.
TWEAK OUT.
TORCH A MALL FOOD COURT.
SO ON BEHALF, ON BEHALF OF ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, PLEASE DO SOMETHING FRIGHTENING
BETWEEN NOW AND THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT, THE REPUBLICANS WILL
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TRULY TERRIFYING LIKE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF BLACKS, WOMEN
AND HISPANICS.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
