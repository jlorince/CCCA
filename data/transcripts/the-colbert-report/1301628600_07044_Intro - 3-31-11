>> TONIGHT AN EXCITING NEW
FRONT IN THE WAR AGAINST
SEXISM, I'VE GOT TO SAY ITS
BACK IS PRETTY EXCITINGING
TOO.
THEN TROUBLE FOR WISCONSIN'S
ANTI-UNION LAW.
LOOKS LIKE SCOTT WALKER GOT
MORE THAN HE REFUSED TO
BARGAIN FOR.
AND MY GUEST EXPLORE PIERS
GIBBON IS THE HOST OF A NEW
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SHOW
EATING WITH CANNIBALS.
HE'LL BE THE FIRST GUEST TO
