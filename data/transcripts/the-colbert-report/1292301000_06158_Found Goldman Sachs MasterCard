( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: COME ON!
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU FOLKS AT HOME, YOU FOLKS AT
HOME WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW
GOOD THESE PEOPLE ARE TO ME.
( LAUGHTER )
I COULD SPEND ALL NIGHT WITH
THEM.
FOLKS, THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON
AMERICANS ARE FACING 9.8%
UNEMPLOYMENT.
THE ONLY CHESTNUTS THEY WANT TO
SEE ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE ARE
THE ONES ATTACHED TO WALL STREET
BANKERS, WHO 24 THIS YEAR ARE
GETTING A RECORD $144 BILLION IN
BONUSES.
YOU SEE, THE ECONOMY IS LIKE
"THE PRODUCERS."
YOU CAN MAKE A LOT MORE ON A
FLOP THAN A HIT.
I SAY GOOD FOR THESE GUY, BUT
CONSUMER BANKING CZAR ELIZABETH
WARREN DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME.
>> WALL STREET IS ABOUT TO GIVE
OUT HUGE BONUSES AGAIN.
THIS JUST STAGGERS ME.
I JUST DON'T HAVE WORDS TO
DESCRIBE WHAT THIS MEANS.
>> Stephen: AND, THAT
ELIZABETH WARREN, IS WHY YOU'RE
NOT GETTING A BILLION DOLLAR
BONUS.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW I'D LOVE TO GET ONE OF THESE
BANKERS ON THE SHOW TO HEAR
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY.
SO FAR NO LUCK, BUT I HAVE A
FEELING THAT MIGHT SOON CHANGE.
YOU SEE, LAST WEEK ONE OF MY
WRITERS WAS DOWN IN TRIBECA, AND
SHE FOUND THIS ON THE STREET.
IT IS A GOLDMAN SACHS MASTER
CARD.
OKAY.
BELONGING TO SOMEONE WHO A QUICK
GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALED IS
PARTNER AT GOLDMAN SACHS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND NOW I HAVE IT.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH, THAT WORKS.
THAT WORKS.
( LAUGHTER )
LET ME TELL YOU, LET ME TELL
YOU, PEOPLE ALWAYS STEREOTYPE
BANKERS AS SILVER-SPOON, IVY
LEAGUE, POLO ENTHUSIASTS WHO
MAJORED IN SALMON-COLORED PANTS.
BUT NOT THIS GUY.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS NAME --
BUCKLEYT. RATCHFORD.
I TELL YOU WHAT, BUCKLEY T.
I'LL HAPPY GIVE YOU THIS CARD
BACK.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS COME ON MY
SHOW AND TALK ABOUT WALL STREET
BONUSES.
AND FOR INCENTIVE, EACH NIGHT
THAT YOU DON'T, I WILL REVEAL
ONE DIGIT OF YOUR CREDIT CARD
NUMBER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHICH, AS WIKILEAKS HAS PROVEN,
IS NOT BLACKMAIL.
IT'S JOURNALISM.
( LAUGHTER )
TONIGHT'S NUMBER: FIVE!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A GOOD SPOT FOR A FIVE.
THAT INDICATES A HIGH CREDIT
LIMIT.
SO ACT FAST, BUCKIE.
THE BALL IS IN YOUR SQUASH
COURT, AT LEAST UNTIL I USE YOUR
CARD TO ADD A SQUASH COURT TO MY
