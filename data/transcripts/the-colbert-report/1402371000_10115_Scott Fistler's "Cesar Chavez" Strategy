[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE][AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS AT HOME, IF YOU'VE NEVERBEEN TO THE SHOW LIVE, YOU'VE
GOT TO COME HERE TO THE STUDIOTO SEE THE SHOW IN PERSON,
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T GET ATHOME IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THIS
ROOM, THE AIR IS THICK WITH THEOPIATE OF LOVE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]AND I'M TAKING DEEP TOKES OFF
THESE PEOPLE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
DON'T DO DRUGS.
NATION, THE MIDTERMS ARERAPIDLY APPROACHING, AND THINGS
LOOK GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS ACROSSTHE BOARD WITH ONE GLARING
EXCEPTION.
THE G.O.P. CONTINUES TO STRUGGLEWITH HISPANIC VOTERS
FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE NOTRALLYING TO THE G.O.P.'S MESSAGE
OF "LOOK, MARCO RUBIO!"
BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S MOREIMPORTANT THAN EVER TO REACH OUT
TO SUBURBAN FUTBOL MADRES ANDAVERAGE JOSE SEIS-PACKS.
BUT A NEW STRATEGY HAS BEENPIONEERED BY ARIZONA REPUBLICAN
SCOTT FISTLER, SEEN HEREPHOTOBOMBING A PICTURE OF A MAP
AFTER...
[LAUGHTER]AFTER LOSING TWO RACES IN A
HEAVILY HISPANIC COMMUNITY.
HE HAS FOUND A WAY TO GET HISNAME OUT THERE.
GET ANOTHER NAME OUT THERE.
>> CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING ACANDIDATE SEEKING OFFICE HERE IN
ARIZONA. SCOTT FISTLER HASLEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO
CESAR CHAVEZ.
>> Stephen: ADIOS, SCOTTFISTLER.
HOLA, CESAR CHAVEZ.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, IF YOUCAN'T BEAT 'EM, PRETEND YOU
JOINED 'EM.
NOW, IF CESAR CHAVEZ STRIKES ACORD WITH MY HISPANIC VIEWER,
IT'S BECAUSE IT IS ALSO THE NAMEOF THE FOUNDER OF THE UNITED
FARM WORKERS WHO POPULARIZED THESLOGAN, "SI SE PUEDA," WHICH
MEANS "YES, WE, CAN," ALTHOUGH IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY, CHAVEZ
MIGHT BE SAYING, "OH, NO HEDIDN'T."
BUT THIS ISN'T MERELY POLITICALPANDERING, FOLKS, THIS CHANGE
WAS A LONG TIME COMING.
AS THE POLITICIAN FORMALLY KNOWNAS FISTLER EXPLAINED, HE
EXPERIENCED MANY HARDSHIPSBECAUSE OF HIS NAME.
I DON'T SEE WHY.
I MEAN, FISTLER, THAT'S A GREATNAME FOR A LEADER.
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S THE HITLEROF FISTING.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HEIL FISTLER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HEIL FISTLER.
[LAUGHTER]SO FISTLER JUST WANTED TO CHANGE
IT TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE APOPULAR NAME WITH VOTERS.
SO I THINK IT SHOWED GREATRESTRAINT THAT HE DIDN'T JUST GO
WITH CHERRY GARCIA.
[LAUGHTER]BUT CESAR CHAVEZ'S CAMPAIGN
ISN'T JUST ABOUT A CONFUSINGNAME.
IT'S ALSO ABOUT A CONFUSING WEBSITE.
>> ON HIS CAMPAIGN WEB SITE,CHAVEZ FEATURES IMAGES OF CROWDS
OF PEOPLE HOLDING CHAVEZ SIGNSAND WEARING T-SHIRTS, BUT THE
PICTURES ARE ACTUALLY FROM ARALLY FROM THE LATE VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT HUGOCHAVEZ.
>> Stephen: OH, OH, OH.
SO ALL HISPANIC RALLIES LOOKALIKE?
THAT IS RACIST.
UNFORTUNATELY THE WEBSITE ISUNCLEAR ABOUT HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE CAMPAIGN.
DO I USE THIS "DONATE NOW"BUTTON UP HERE AT THE TOP, OR
ONE OF THESE NINE "DONATE NOW"BUTTONS DOWN HERE.
I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.
YOU NEED ONE BUTTON FOR EACHCANDIDATE HE'S PRETENDING TO BE.
[LAUGHTER]FOLKS, SENOR CHAVEZ'S STRATEGY
SHOWS HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WINTHE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016.
JUST FIELD A SLATE OF MINORITYCANDIDATES.
THERE'S LOTS OF CHOICES.
THERE'S PANCHO VILLA, MARTINLUTHER KING, MAHATMA GANDHI,
AUNG SAN SUU KYI, HARRIETTUBMAN, SITTING BULL.
OH, SITTING BULL'S GOT A REALCHANCE, WELL, UNLESS HILLARY
CLINTON DECIDES TO RUN.
