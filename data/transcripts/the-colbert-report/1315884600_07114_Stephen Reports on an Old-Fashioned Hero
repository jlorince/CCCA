FOLKS, SPEAK TOO SOON.
FOLKS, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
NEWSPAPERS ARE A DYING BREED.
THEY'RE PART OF AMERICA'S
PAST LIKE BUGGY WHIP MAKERS
AND THE MIDDLE CLASS.
BUT AS MUCH AS I DISLIKE
THEM, NEWSPAPERS DO PERFORM
AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION.
FOR ONE, IT'S HARD TO HOUSE
TRAIN A DOG ON AN I PAD.
APP MAKERS, GET CRACKING.
BUT SOME HEROES AREN'T
GIVING UP SO EASILY.
THEY STILL GO AFTER THE BIG
SCOOPS THE OLD FARXED WAY.
THE COLE BERTH REPORT'S
STEPHENICAL BETTER ROMPS.
>> WITH SOCIAL NETWORKS
CROWDING IN, SOME MAIN STAYS
OF JOURNLTISM LIKE "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" ARE ABANDONING
OLD SCHOOL REPORTING FOR NEW
MEDIA.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY
WHO IS A REPORTER ISN'T ON
TWITTER.
I CONSTANTLY BERATE MY
COLLEAGUES WITH WHO AREN'T
ON IT.
>> Stephen: BUT ONE REPORTER
DIDN'T GET THAT TWEET.
WAYNE FORD HAS BEEN WORKING
THE BEAT FOR OVER 29 YEARS
AT THE ATHENS BANNER HERALD.
ATHEN'S GEORGIA'S MOST
PRESTIGIOUS AND ONLY
NEWSPAPER.
EDITOR ROGER NIELSEN.
>> WAYNE REPRESENTS THE OLD
NASH,-- FASHIONED KIND OF
JOURNALIST, YOU KNOW, THE
SHIRT AND A TIE KIND OF GUY
TO GO OUT THERE AND MEET
PEOPLE.
>> AS A JOURNALIST, I GUESS
GROWING UP WALTER CRONKITE
WAS MY HERO.
>> Stephen: LIKE HIS HERO,
WAYNE FORD KNOWS TO GET THE
REAL STORY A REPORTER HAS TO
HIT THE PAVEMENT.
>> ON JULY 12th I WAS AT THE
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE
PROBABLY BEFORE 8:00 THIS
MORNING.
AND I GO THROUGH THE REPORTS
AND I CAME ACROSS ONE REPORT
ON ROGERS ROAD.
>> Stephen: ROGERS ROAD.
>> IT'S A PLACE IN THE
COUNTY WHERE IF YOU ARE
GOING TO RUN SOME LAW THAT
IS PROBABLY THE PLACE ARE
YOU GOING TONED UP.
>> Stephen: COUNTY SHERIFF
SCOTT BERRY.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES
TO BE TOLD ON ROGERS ROAD.
>> AND A STORY WAS WHAT
WAYNE NEEDED.
SO HE WENT OUT TO MEET THE
SUSPECT.
A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND KNOWN
AS CHRIS TOOLE.
>> I GOT A LONG HISTORY WITH
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.
AND USUALLY THEY DON'T
BELIEVE ME OVER ANYBODY ELSE
SO NORMALLY I'M THE ONE THEY
TAKE THE JAIL WHETHER I'M
GUILTY OR NOT.
>> Stephen: BUT.
>> NORMLY I'M GUILTY.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED
THAT DAY ON ROGERS ROAD.
>> DEPUTIES WERE DISPATCHED
TO THE 911 CENTER TO A FIGHT
CALL.
>> TWO OF THE DEPUTIES
DECIDED TO TAKE A BACK
ENTRANCE BECAUSE THEY
THOUGHT HE WOULD PROBABLY
RUN.
HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR IT.
>> I RUN BECAUSE THE POLICE
WANT TO TAKE ME TO JAIL AND
I DON'T WANT TO GO.
WANTS AND HE RAN OUT THE
DOOR CARRYING A BEER IN HIS
HAND.
THE DEPUTIES ORDERED HIM AT
TASTER POINT TO STOP.
>> ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,
THEY ASKED HIM TEN TIMES TO
LAY DOWN.
>> I WAS SWEATY T WAS HOT.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET DIRT
ALL OVER ME.
>> HE FINALLY LAID DOWN BUT
CONTINUED TO DRINK HIS BEER
WHILE HE WAS ON THE GROUND.
>> HE WAS BOUND AND
DETERMINED TO FINISH THAT
BEER BEFORE THEY PUT THE
HANDCUFFS ON HIM.
>> I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY
INTERESTING.
>> Stephen: WAYNE KNEW THERE
WAS A BIG STORY HERE.
>> ACTUALLY, CHASING AND
PUTTING HANDCUFFS ON CHRIS
TOOLE ISN'T A BIG STORY
HERE.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE
DO.
WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
WE'LL LIKELY DO IT AGAIN.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT WAYNE KNEW THERE WAS A A
STORY HERE.
>> HEART RACING, WAYNE
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.
SOON HE WAS FACE-TO-FACE
WITH THE INFAMOUS CHRIS
TOOLE.
AND WHAT CHRIS TOLD WAYNE
WILL SHOCK YOU.
>> HE TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, HIS
MOTHER IS COMING.
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO
LEAVE.
>> I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO
TALK TO HIM.
>> Stephen: THERE WAS NO
STORY HERE.
>> I WAS DISAPPOINTED.
>> Stephen: DISAPPOINTED BUT
NOT DETERRED.
>> WAYNE'S JOURNALISTIC
INSTINCT TO FIND A STORY
KICKED IN.
>> I WALKED UP THE DIRT
DRIVE TO BOBBY'S HOUSE.
IT WAS NOT THAT FAR AWAY.
>> Stephen: THIS IS BOBBY
KIRK.
WAYNE HAD A HUNCH HE WOULD
TALK.
>> WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, I
HOT STUFF AND TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
HE KEEP PILE APPROXIMATING
UP GO THROUGH YOUR MOUTH
INTO YOUR STOMACH, YOU GOT
ANYTHING IN YOU ELSE'S, THAT
STUFF GOING TO BURN IT OUT,
YOU WON'T HAVE NO KIND OF
DISEASE.
>> WHEN BOBBY STARTED
TALKING I KNEW HI A STORY
BECAUSE BOBBY LIKES TO TALK.
>> ARMADILLOS, RUNNING THEM
HARD.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT,-- YOU
DON'T.
THAT WILL TELL YOU ALL THE
YOUNG GENERATION DON'T KNOW
NOTHING.
YOU TWEET.
>> Stephen: BUT WAYNE WAS
SURE BOBBY WAS BURYING THE
LEAD.
>> NO, I TELL YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW, ANYTHING.
JUST-- ANYTHING TO MAKE A
BIGUN, NOT NO LITTLE STORY,
A BIGUN.
>> Stephen: AND THIS WAS A
BIGUN.
WAYNE PRESSED BOBBY FOR MORE
DETAILS AND FINALLY HE
SPILLED IT.
>> I TOLD HIM IT'S TOO HOT
TO FISH.
>> BOBBY SAID IT WAS TOO HOT
TO FISH.
>> Stephen: TOO HOT TO FISH.
>> THE FRONT OF THE PAPER
SAID TOO HOT TO FISH AND
SHOWED A PICTURE OF BOBBY
AND THEN ON THE INSIDE OF
THE FEATURE SECTION, MAN
SAYS IT'S TOO HOT TO FISH SO
BASICALLY IT'S THE SAME
HEADLINE.
>> TOO HOT TO FISH, COOL.
>> Stephen: BUT WITH EVERY
BIG STORY COMES BIG
CONTROVERSY.
>> LOCAL BAIT SHOP OWNER
CAROLL ANN.
>> FISH DON'T FEEL THE
WEATHER.
>> AIN'T NEVER TOO HOT TO
FISH AS LONG AS YOU GOT COLD
BEER.
>> Stephen: BUT WAYNE HAD
DONE HIS RESEARCH.
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
>> I DIDN'T CALL A
CLIMATOLOGIST.
I DIDN'T CALL THE WEATHER
CHANNEL, OR I DIDN'T EVEN GO
OUT AND LOOK AT THE
THERMOMETER.
I JUST KNEW IT WAS HOT.
>> Stephen: BUT WAS IT?
WE ASKED DR. DAVID STUKE BERRY,
STATE CLIMATOLOGIST AND
PROVE STER-- PROFESSOR AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA.
THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS THE
SCIENCE IN, 3, 2, 1.
>> WHETHER THIS HAS BEEN THE
HOTTEST SUMMER ON RECORD,
THE ANSWER IS YES, NO AND
MAYBE.
>> Stephen: GOOD ENOUGH.
IT WAS WAYNE FORD'S OLD
SCHOOL REPORTING THAT LEAD
HIM TO THE BIG STORY.
>> I NEVER THOUGHT WOW THIS
IS A GREAT STORY OR IN IS A
GOOD STORY.
JUST LIKE WOW, I'M GLAD I'VE
GOT THIS STORY.
>> Stephen: AND IT IS
STORIES THAT WILL SAVE
JOURNALISM.
BECAUSE WHILE WAYNE FORD WAS
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT, "THE
NEW YORK TIMES" WAS
FOLLOWING THEIR TWEETS.
ALL THE WAY TO GEORGIA.
WHERE THEY FOUND A STORY
THEY COULD READ, REWRITE AND
PUBLISH THEMSELVES.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED OLD
SCHOOL REPORTERS LIKE WAYNE
FORD.
>> I FELT LIKE I COVERED THE
TRUTH THAT DAY.
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU A
STORY.
>> Stephen: TELL US A STORY
IN BLACK AND WHITE.
>> THAT'S THE HOTTEST DAY I
EVER SEEN.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
WAYNE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
