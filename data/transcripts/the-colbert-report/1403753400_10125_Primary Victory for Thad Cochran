>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I AM... I DON'T KNOWABOUT YOU, BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY
STONE-COLD FURIOUS ABOUTYESTERDAY'S HEATED REPUBLICAN
SENATE PRIMARY IN MISSISSIPPI,WHICH PITTED TEA PARTY
CHALLENGER AND SHORT-HAIREDSEVERUS SNAPE CHRIS McDANIEL
AGAINST INCUMBENT SENATOR ANDMAN IN REVERSE MORTGAGE AD
THAD COCHRAN.
I SAY IT IS TIME FOR COCHRAN TOGO.
HE'S A BIG GOVERNMENT WASHINGTONINSIDER FAMOUS FOR CHANNELING
FEDERAL CASH TO HIS STATE.
>> HE GOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OFFUNDING FOR MISSISSIPPI AND THE
MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST AFTERKATRINA.
>> NO ONE BRINGS HOME MORE BACONTO HIS STATE THAN THAD COCHRAN.
>> HE'S ABOUT BRINGING HOME THEBACON.
>> BRINGING HOME THE BACON.
>> HIS CALLING CARD IS THAT HEBRINGS HOME THE PORK.
>> Stephen: HE BRINGS HOME THEPORK AND THE BACON.
THOUGH, TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIR,HOG MEAT IS MISSISSIPPI'S
OFFICIAL STATE CURRENCY.
THE POINT IS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THE POINT IS, THAD COCHRAN IS
PLAYING THE DIRTY POLITICS OFPROMISING PEOPLE STUFF AND THEN
DELIVERING IT.
BUT NOT CHRIS McDANIEL.
HE'S SO AGAINST FEDERAL SPENDINGTHAT HE TOLD A CROWD AT OLE
MISS, I'M NOT GOING DO ANYTHINGFOR YOU.
I'M GOING TO GET THE GOVERNMENTOFF YOUR BACK.
THEN I'M GOING TO LET YOU DO ITFOR YOURSELF.
THUS STANDING BY HIS OLDCAMPAIGN SLOGAN, McDANIEL
2014, YOU'LL GET NOTHING ANDYOU'LL LIKE IT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WELL, FOLKS, I'M SAD TO SAY THE
RESULTS ARE IN AND COCHRAN WON50.9% TO 49.1%.
FEW THINGS ARE EVER THAT CLOSEIN MISSISSIPPI OTHER THAN THE
GENOMES OF MARRIED COUPLES.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]BUT IT'S NOT JUST... IT'S NOT
JUST THAT COCHRAN WON.
IT'S HOW HE WON.
>> THAD COCHRAN SAID, LOOK,STRATEGICALLY I HAVE TO WIN OVER
BLACKS AND UNION MEMBERS.
THAT'S WHO HE WENT AFTER.
EVIDENTLY THEY SHOWED UP.
>> THE CONGRESSMAN REACHED OUTTHE VOTERS BEYOND HIS
CONSERVATIVE BASE, INCLUDINGBLACKS.
>> IT'S UNREAL THE LEVEL OFBLACK TURNOUT IN A REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY YESTERDAY.
>> IS THIS THE FUTURE OF THEREPUBLICAN PARTY, YOU BRAG ABOUT
YOUR BIG-SPENDING WAYS TO THEVOTERS AND YOU RELY ON THE
SUPPORT OF BLACK LIBERALDEMOCRATS TO GET YOU ELECTED?
>> STEPHEN: HE APPEALED TO BLACKPEOPLE.
THAT'S INCREDIBLY SELFISH.
DOESN'T THAD COCHRAN KNOWTHERE'S NO "I" IN MISSISSIPPI.
AND THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT, FOLKS.
COCHRAN MADE A DEAL WITH THEDEVILCRATS, WHO TEAMED WITH THE
MISSISSIPPI CONSERVATIVE PAC TODO GET OUT THE VOTE WORK AND
RALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS.
THOSE DEMOCRATS, BISHOP RONNIECRUDUP, SR., AND JAMES
SCOOBY-DOO WARREN.
RUT ROH!
AND, FOLKS, I'M TELLING YOU, ANDMcDANIELS WOULD HAVE WON THIS
RACE, TOO IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUMEDDLING KIDS.
[LAUGHTER]I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING SAY IS,
WHEN DID BLACK PEOPLE STARTVOTING?
WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL SIT DOWNWITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE
RESPONSIBLE FOR BLACK PEOPLEVOTING IN MISSISSIPPI,
REPRESENTATIVE ELEANOR HOLMESNORTON.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
