MILLIONAIRE.
MEANWHILE FOLKS, BIG
REPUBLICAN DEBATE TONIGHT IN
FLORIDA.
IT IS THE 19th OF THE
SEASON.
ONE MORE AND THEY WIN A FREE
DEBATE.
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE DAYS
LEFT RIGHT NOW UNTIL THE
FLORIDA PRIMARY.
ROMNEY AND GINGRICH ARE NECK
AND NECK.
WELL, NECK AND -- --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AMPHIBIAN DISPLAY POUCH.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU,
M ITT IS IN TROUBLE.
A RECENT POLL FOUND THAT 61%
OF PEOPLE SAID MITT ROMNEY
WILL SAY ANYTHING HE HAS TO
TO GET ELECTED.
AND TO WOO THAT 61%, MITT
ROMNEY IMMEDIATELY AGREED.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS, MITT ROMNEY
RECENTLY PROVED THAT HIS
PRINCIPLESES ARE AS
UNWAIVERING AS HIS HAIR.
HE HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, BUT
HE HAS NEVER SAID GOOD
PEOPLE OR BAD PEOPLE.
UNTIL YESTERDAY.
WHEN HE STOOD UP FOR THE
MOST MALIGNED CORPORATE
PEOPLE OF ALL, BANKS.
>> THE BANKS ARBTS BAD
PEOPLE, THEY'RE JUST
OVERWHELMED RIGHT NOW.
>> BANKS ARE SCARED TO DEATH,
OF COURSE.
THEY'RE FEELING THE SAME
THING THAT YOU'RE FEELING.
>> Stephen: YES.
THE BANKS ARE FEELING THE
SAME THING THAT YOU'RE
FEELING.
WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE,
THEY ALSO THINK THAT BELONGS
TO ME.
(LAUGHTER)
AND LET'S NOT FORGET, LET'S
NOT FORGET THAT FLORIDA HAS
MORE FORECLOSURES THAN ANY
OTHER STATE.
SO WITH PRO BANK STATEMENTS
LIKE THAT, MITT ROMNEY IS TO
THE GOING TO WIN ANY POP
LAYER CONTESTS BUT HE'S NOT
OUT TO WIN A POPULARITY
CONTEST, HE'S OUT TO WIN AN
ELECTION.
HOW DO THOSE WORK.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, HE'S UP [BLEEP] CREEK.
NOW ON THE OTHER HAND, NEWT
GINGRICH HAS FOUND AN ISSUE
SURE TO APPEAL TO FLORIDA
VOTERS.
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
TODAY IS GOING TO BE VERY,
VERY BOLD.
BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM
WE WILL HAVE THE FIRST
PERMANENT BASE ON THE MOON
AND IT WILL BE AMERICAN.
WE WILL HAVE COMMERCIAL NEAR
NEAR-EARTH ACTIVITIES THAT
INCLUDE SCIENCE, TOURISM AND
MANUFACTURING.
>> Stephen: YES, AMERICA
WILL BRING MANUFACTURING TO
THE MOON.
OHIO, [BLEEP] OUT OF LUCK.
AND NEWT'S VISION FOR THE
MOON GOES FURTHER.
>> WHEN WE HAVE 13,000
AMERICANS LIVING ON THE MOON
THEY CAN PETITION TO BECOME
A STATE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
THE MOON IS GOING TO BE A
STATE.
SUCK IT WASHINGTON D.C.,
SUCK IT.
(APPLAUSE)
BUT FOLKS FOR SOME REASON
THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT IS NOT
SOLD ON NEWT.
>> MOST OF US ARE TERRIFIED
TO DEATH THAT HE WOULD
BECOME THE REPUBLICAN
NOMINEE.
>> THIS IS FAVOR ABILITY
VERSUS UNFAVOR ABILITY.
NEWT GINGRICH, 27% FAVORABLE,
56% UNFAVOURABLE.
BELIEVE ME, REPUBLICANS IN
CONGRESS WILL BE TERRIFIED
TO RUN WITH THIS MAN FOR
FEAR THEY WILL LOSE THE
HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
>> IF NEWT GINGRICH IS ABLE
TO WIN THE FLORIDA PRIMARY,
YOU WILL SEE A PANIC AND A
MELTDOWN OF THE REPUBLICAN
ESTABLISHMENT THAT IS BEYOND
MY ABILITY TO ARTICULATE IN
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
>> Stephen: YES, THERE IS NO
ENGLISH WORD FOR THAT KIND
OF MELTDOWN.
THE CLOSEST IS THE GERMAN
CLAUSTFUCHEN, COMPOUND WORD.
NOW WE'VE ALL HEARD THE
SORDID DETAILS OF NEWT'S
MARITAL HISTORY SO I DO NOT
NEED TO DREDGE UP HOW HE
MARRIED HIS HIGH SCHOOL MATH
TEACHER, LEFT HER FOR
ANOTHER WOMAN WHEN SHE HAD
CANCER, THEN LEFT THAT WOMAN
FOR A THIRD WOMAN WHEN THE
SECOND WOMAN WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH AN INCURABLE CASE OF
NEWT WANTED SOME STRANGE.
BUT FOX NEWS THERAPIST
DR. KEITH ABLO SEES ALL THIS
AS POSITIVE WRITING QUOTE
WHEN THREE WOMEN WANT TO
SIGN ON FOR LIFE WITH A MAN
WHO IS NOW RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, I WORRY MORE
ABOUT WHETHER WE'LL BE
CLAMOURING FOR A THIRD
GINGRICH TERM, NOT WHETHER
WE'LL WANT TO LET HIM GO
AFTER ONE.
YES, GINGRICH IS SO
SEDUCTIVE THAT THREE WOMEN,
TWO OF WHOM KNEW HE WAS AN
ADULTERER WERE WILLING TO
PICK NEWT.
SO ABLO IS SAYING WE SHOULD
LOOK PAST HIS WEAKNESSES TO
HIS STRENGTHS.
WHICH ARE HIS WEAKNESSES.
FOLKS, NEWT HAS PROVEN
HIMSELF SENSITIVE TOO.
ACCORDING TO ABLO, TWO WOMEN
HAVE SAT DOWN WITH HIM WHILE
HE DELIVERED INCREDIBLE,
PAINFUL TRUTHS.
THAT HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH OTHER WOMEN AND NEEDED
TO FOLLOW HIS HEART DESPITE
THE RISK HE WOULD BE TAKING
WITH HIS REPUTATION.
YES, HE HAD TO FOLLOW HIS
HEART OR WHATEVER WAS
THROBBING SO LOUDLY.
AND--
(APPLAUSE)
AND FOLKS, AS ABLO SAYS,
THIS WAS A RISK TO HIS
REPUTATION.
SOMEONE WITHOUT DR. ABLO'S
PSYCHIATRIC INSIGHTS MIGHT
MISDIAGNOSE NEWT AS A
SOCIOPATHIC BELIEVE BELIEVE
