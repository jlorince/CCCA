LAST FEW MONTHS OF MY SHOW, ANDI PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL STAY
STRONG ON FAMILY VALUES TO THEBITTER END.
SINCE DAY ONE OF THIS PROGRAM,I'VE HAD AN UNSHAKEABLE STANCEON

(LAUGHTER)AS MUCH AS I LOVE AMERICA, AS A
PERSON OF FAITH, ALL THAT REALLYMATTERS TO ME IS THE POSITION OF
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THAT'SALWAYS BEEN, GUY ON GIRL, LIGHTS
ON, A LITTLE WEEPING, A LITTLEPRAYING, AND STRAIGHT TO SLEEP.
UNTIL NOW.
>> NEWS FROM THE VATICAN, WIDELYDESCRIBED AS SOMETHING OF AN
EARTHQUAKE FOR THE CATHOLICCHURCH.
>> A STUNNING SHIFT BY THEVATICAN ON APPROACH TO GAYS AND
LESBIANS.>> BISHOPS DRAFTED NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE CHURCH'S ATTITUDE TOWARDHOMOSEXUALITY
>> THE VATICAN URGED PASTORS TOBE MORE WELCOMING TO GAYS
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD INTHREE PERSONS! THE VATICAN IS
WELCOMING THE GAYS IN? NEXTTHING YOU KNOW THE PLACE WILL BE
FILLED WITH ANTIQUES! JUSTLISTEN TO THE IMMORAL, DEPRAVED
SUPPORT THE VATICAN OFFERSIN THIS DOCUMENT: "HOMOSEXUALS
HAVE GIFTS AND QUALITIES TOOFFER THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY."
OKAY, THEY HAVE GIFTS BUT IT'SMOSTLY KIMONOS AND I'M ALWAYS
FEELING LIKE I'M IN A BATHROBE.
THE DOCUMENT GOES ON TO ASK IF THE CHURCH IS CAPABLE OF
WELCOMING GAY PEOPLE ANDGUARANTEEING THEM FRATERNAL
SPACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES."FRATERNAL SPACE?
AREN'T OUR FRATS ALREADY GAYENOUGH?
LISTEN UP POPE FABULOUS I, THELORD IS PERFECTLY CLEAR ON THE
GAYS.
THE FIRST TIME HE SAW A NAKEDDUDE RUNNING AROUND, HE RIBBED
OUT HIS RIB AND FORCED HIM TOHAVE SEX WITH A WOMAN. AND HE
WAS PRETTY CLEAR WITH HER, TOO,NO FRUITY STUFF!
