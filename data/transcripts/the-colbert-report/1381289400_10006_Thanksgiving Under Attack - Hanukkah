( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
NATION, CHECK YOUR CALENDARSBECAUSE THANKSGIVING IS JUST
AROUND THE CORNER, AND, FOLK, ITIS MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY, WHICH IS
A BIT SURPRISING SINCE I'M NOFAN OF GIVING OR SAYING THANKS.
( LAUGHTER )EVERY YEAR, WHEN I CELEBRATE IT,
I PUSH THE ENVELOPE.
LAST YEAR, I HAD A GRAVY BOAT.
THIS YEAR I HAVE A GRAVY KAYAK.
BUT, SADLY, FOLKS-- YEAH, YEAH.
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
SADLY, AMERICA'S SACRED DAYDEDICATED TO FAMILY AND
HEARINGNANA'S UNVARNISHEDOPINION OF PHILIPPINEOS IS IN IS
IN DANGER BECAUSE THIS ISTHANKSGIVING UNDER ATTACK.
( GUNFIRE )( GOBBLE )
>> IF YOU NEED--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IF YOU NEED SOME EXPLANATION ASTO WHY JESUS IS COMING OUT OF
THE TOMB, WEARING A PILGRIM HATAND A BLUNDERBUSS, WATCH SOME OF
OUR SHOWS FROM ABOUT FIVE YEARSAGO.
NATION, THE THANKSGIVING TABLEIS GOING TO BE EXTRA CROWDED
THIS YEAR.
NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU STILLHAVEN'T WALKED OFF LAST YEAR'S
GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE.
>> TURKEY DAY MEETS THE JEWISHFESTIVAL OF LIGHTS THIS YEAR.
IN A RARE CONVERGENCE,THANKSGIVING FALLS ON THE FIRST
DAY OF HANUKKAH.
>> Stephen:  HOW DARE YOU,HANUKKAH!
THESE TWO HOLIDAYS HAVE NOTHINGIN COMMON.
HANUKKAH CELEBRATES THE STRUGGLEOF AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE'S FIGHT
AGAINST INVADING CONKERS, WHILETHANKSGIVING IS ABOUT OUR
HEALTHY AND NURTURINGRELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIANS.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  NOW, NOW-- BUTNOW THEY'RE OVERLAPPING.
AND KEEPING THE STORY STRAIGHTIS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.
PRETTY SOON, SCHOOL KIDS WILLTHINK THANKSGIVING STARTED WHEN
THE WAMPANOAG SAT DOWN WITH THEYAKABEES, AND THE YAMS LASTED
EIGHT NIGHTS.
FOLKS, IT WASN'T A MIRTELEKELL.
NOBODY LIKES YAMS.
REALLY, AH, REALLY?
SYMPATHY FOR THE YAMS.
( LAUGHTER )AND NOW, INSTEAD OF DRAWING A
HAND TURKEY, WE'LL BE EXPECTEDTO DRAW A HAND MENORAH.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
YOU NEED BOTH HANDS TO MAKE THEMENORAH, AND THEN WHAT DO YOU
DRAW WITH?
IT CAN'T BE DONE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> THE SHAMS OSH IS NOT
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> THE SHAMS OSH IS NOT
STRAIGHT.
I'M SORRY.
NATION-- NOW IT'S ON MY FACE.
THAT IS NOT COMING OUT.
THAT'S IT.
ANYWAY, NATION, I SHOULD HAVESEEN THIS COMING.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I WANT TO WARN OUR ANILLATES WEMIGHT BE GOING A LITTLE BIT LONG
TONIGHT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DISCUSSINGHANUKKAH AND I DREW A MUSTACHE
RIGHT THERE.
THAT IS BAD FORM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
REALLY, REALLY NOT GOOD.
FOLKS, I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THISCOMING.
I HAVE NEVER, EVER TRUSTEDHANUKKAH.
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TOHIDE, WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MANY
ALIASES.
PLUS, PLUS HANUKKAH IS SUPPOSEDTO OVERLAP WITH CHRISTMAS.
SO I CAN SAY MERRY CHRISTMASINSTEAD OF HAPPY HOLIDAYS, AND
EVERYONE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHICHHOLIDAY I'M NOT WISHING THEY
HAVE A HAPPY ONE OF.
SO THIS YEAR, FOLKS, TO MAKESURE NO ONE IS CONFUSED I'M
GOING TO HAVE TO SPENDTHANKSGIVING WISHING EVERYBODY A
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
IT'S CHAOS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HANUKKAH,I'VE HAD IT UP TO HEAR BLOCKING
OUR HOLIDAYS.
I DO NOT-- LISTEN TO ME EYE DONOT WANT TO SEE HANUKKAH
STARTING ON THANKSGIVING DAY FORANOTHER 80,000 YEARS.
>> IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN FORANOTHER-- GET THIS-- 79,000
YEARS.
>> Stephen:  NOW YOU'RE JUSTTRYING TO PISS ME OFF.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
