FOLKS,UB I'M NOT ONE TO SIT INJUDGMENT.
I PREFER TO JUMP UP AND DOWN INJUDGMENT.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FIRST UP, FOLKS, JUST SECONDSAGO I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR, I'M
NO FAN OF DRUG ADDICTS.
JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM MAKESME SO ANGRY I NEED ANOTHER
XANAX.
THAT'S WHY I WAS HIGH ON LIFEWHEN I LEARNED WITH A NEW STUDY
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA THAT FOUND A
FATHER'S COCAINE USE MAKES HISSONS LESSENSITIVE TO THE DRUG,
AND THEREBY MORE LIKELY TORESIST ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS.
WHICH MEANS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ACRIPPLING COCAINE ADDICTION, BE
SURE TO THANK YOUR DAD.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND HIM.
HE'S PROBABLY GIVING OUT HANDIESAT THE BUS STATION.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
MY HAT TO HOPPED-UP POPS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
( APPLAUSE )YOU HAVE FINALLY--
( CHEERS )YOU HAVE FINALLY-- YOU HAVE
FINALLY EARNED THAT FATHER OFTHE YEAR MUG YOU STOLE FROM THE
HALLMARK STORE AFTER BITING THECASHIER.
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT COCAINECAUSES D.N.A. ALTERATIONS IN
SPERM IN WHICH THE CHANGES ARETRANSMITTED TO MALES IN THE NEXT
GENERATION, MEANING COCAINEADDICTION SKIPS A GENERATION,
LIKE BALDNESS.
BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TOAVOID BALDNESS, REMEMBER, YOU
CAN SELL YOUR HAIR FOR COKE.
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE A DUDEDO A BUMP OFF A TOILET SEAT AT A
STRIP CLUB, JUST SAY TOYOURSELF, "THAT GUY'S GOING TO
MAKE A GREAT DAD."
NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM NO FAN OFAMERICA'S GLOBAL ARCHNEMESIS AND
PRIMARY INVESTOR CHINA.
THEY ARE SO SMUG WITH THEIRSURGING ECONOMY, THEIR WALL
VISIBLE FROM SPACE, AND THEIRSEEMINGLYLESS ENDs SUPPLY OF
LUCKY NUMBERS.
( LAUGHTER )BUT FINALLY, FINALLY, AMERICAN
CULTURE IS STRIKING BACK.
>> STARBUCKS IS FACING SCRUTINYIN CHINA THIS WEEK BECAUSE STATE
MEDIA IS ACCUSING IT OFOVERPRICING.
$4.50 FOR A MEDIUM-SIZED LATTE,ROUGHLY A THIRD MORE THAN IN THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
OUR COLD WAR HAS ESCALATED INTOA CRISE SO HOT, YOU NEED ONE OF
THOSE CARD BOARD THINGS TO HOLDIT.
SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HATTO STARBUCKS FOR FINDING A WAY
TO STICK IT TO THE CHINESE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WE'VE CALLED OUT THE CHINESE ONONE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION AFTER
ANOTHER WITH NO RESPONSE.
BUT TO CRANK UP THE PRIVACY ANO-FOAM MATCHIATO, AND THE
GOVERNMENT RELEASES A 20-MINUTEBROADCAST CALLED-- AND THIS IS
TRUE-- "STARBUCKS, EXPENSIVE INCHINA."
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FOLLOW-UPFILM-- ""DUNKIN' DONUTS: WHEN
THE HELL ARE THEY SELLING TUNASANDWICHES.
WHAT'S BEHIND THE BULL MARKET INTHE CHINA COFFEE SHOP?
ACCORDING TO STOOSHZ ITS HIGHERCOST COMES FROM SUCH FACTORS AS
LABOR AND INGREDIENTS.
OF COURSE INGREDIENTS WILL BEMORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IN CHINA
FRAPPACHINOS CONTAIN FRESH LUMPCRAB MEAT AND CADMIUM.
SPEAKING OF CHINA-- I JUST WAS--AND THIS WEEK, THERE WAS MORE
BAD NEWS.
>> CHINESE SHOPPERS SET ONLINESALES RECORDS MONDAY.
SHOPPERS CLICKED THEIR WAY TOMORE THAN $5 BILLION IN PRODUCTS
ON CHINA'S LARGEST E-COMMERCESITE.
THAT DWARFS SALES ON CYBERMONDAY IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> $5 BILLION WORTH OF SALES.
>> THAT IS 2.
THE 5 TIMES MORE THAN CYBERMONDAY IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, IF CHINAHAS THE CASH TO DO THIS, WE'RE
CLEARLY NOT BORROWING ENOUGHUPON IT
( LAUGHTER )I'M GIVING THE NEXT WAG OF MY
FING TORE AMERICAN CONSUMERS.
HOW YOU CAN NOT OUTSPEND THESEGUYS?
ONLINE SHOPPING IS MUCH HARDERFOR THE CHINESE.
AFTER THEY BUY AN iPAD, THEYHAVE TO RUN BACK TO THE FACTORY
TO MAKE IT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
THE OCCASION FOR ALL THIS PEKINGKA-CHING WAS NOVEMBER 11,
CHINA'S SINGLES' DAY, SYMBOLIZEBIDE THE FOUR LONELY ONES OF
11-11.
OF COURSE THE IDEA OF ONE AS THELOAMEST NUMBER WAS FIRST FOUND
IN THE WRITINGS OF CHINESEPHILOSOPHER, HA-RI NIL-SUN.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NOW, THE CHINESE, THE CHINESEORIGINALLY STARTED SINGLES DAY
AS A TIME FOR UNMARRIED MEP TOLAMENT THEIR SOLO STATUS WITH A
DRINK.
WE HAVE A SIMILAR PRACTICE OFMEN DRINKING ALONE IN AMERICA.
IT'S CALLED LADIES' NIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO TAKE
A LESSON FROM CHINA AND HARNESSTHE ECONOMIC POWER OF LONELY,
SINGLE MEN.
YOU GUYS NEED TO STEP UP ANDSTART BUYING MORE STUFF.
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOINGRIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE WATCHING MY SHOW.
ON THE COUCH, PROBABLY ALONE.
ME, I GO HOME EVERY NIGHT ANDSPEND TIME WITH MY LOVED ONES.
DADDY LOVES YOU, PLAYSTATION 4.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WHO YOU DOVE ME BACK?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
