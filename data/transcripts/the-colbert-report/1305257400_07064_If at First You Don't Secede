>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, AND I'M SURE YOU KNOW
2011 MARKS THE SES QUESTION
CENTENNIAL, IT MEAN --00 IN
SASQUATCH YEARS ON TUESDAY
MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAR
CHINA CELEBRATED CON FEDERAL
MEMORIAL DAY.
THE OFFICIAL START OF
CONFEDERATE SUMMER WHICH
ENDS ON CON FED RATE LABOR
DAY.
CON FED RATE LABOR, OF
COURSE, WAS DONE BY THESE
PEOPLE.
REMEMBER, AFTER CONFEDERATE
LABOR DAY YOU DON'T WANT TO
BE CAUGHT WEARING WHITE.
YOU JUST WANT TO BE WHITE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU SEE, THE
CIVIL WAR, I BELIEVE, IS
MUCH MISUNDERSTOOD IT WAS
NOT ABOUT SLACHERY T WAS
ABOUT STATES' RIGHTS.
JUST LIKE WORLD WAR II WAS
ABOUT FACIAL HAIR.
AND STATES' RIGHTS ARE JUST
AS RELEVANT TODAY.
THAT'S WHY DON'T I AM PROUD
TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST IN MY
FOUR-YEAR SERIES IF AT FIRST
YOU DON'T SUCCEED.
TONIGHT, TONIGHT THE DIMMEST
THREAT TO LIBERTY YET.
LIGHT BULBS.
FOLKS, I'VE WARNED YOU THE
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATIONS
ARE ABOUT TO ABOLISH
TRADITIONAL INCANDESCENT
BULBS.
THEY WANT US TO USE THESE
UNNATURAL COMPACT FLORESCENT
BULBS.
IT LOOKS LIKE A SOFT SERVE
ICE CREAM CONE BUT TRUST ME,
IT'S NOT.
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT SOUTH
CAROLINA IS FIGHTING BACK.
>> IN SOUTH CAROLINA, A
PROPOSED HOUSE BILL CALLED
THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULB
FREEDOM ACT WOULD ALLOW A
BULB MANUFACTURER IN THE
STATE TO CONTINUE MAKING
INCANDESCENT BULBS AS LONG
AS THEY ARE SOLD IN SOUTH
CAROLINA.
>> Stephen: WE SOUTH
CARLINIANS ARE COMMITTED TO
KEEPING OUR LIGHT BULBS AS
LOCAL AS OUR GENE POOL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WE DON'T EXPECT
OUTSIDERS TO UNDERSTAND.
THIS IS A HERITAGE ISSUE.
IT'S A MATTER OF STATES'
RIGHTS.
BECAUSE IS IT A ROV
ENSCIENTIFIC FACT THAT
COMPACT FLORESCENT BULL YOU
BES ARE INFERIOR TO
INCANDESCENT.
THEY ARE NOTICEABLY DARKER.
I WOULD SAY ABOUT 3/5 AS
BRIGHT.
NOW STRICT ADHERENCE WITH
THE CONSTITUTION'S
INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE
THESE INCANDESCENTS MUST
STAY IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BY
LAW.
THEY WILL BE CLEARLY BRANDED
MADE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND
SHOULD ANY OF THEM ESCAPE
INTO NEIGHBORING STATES,
THEY MUST BE RETURNED
IMMEDIATELY AS SPECIFIED IN
THE FUGITIVE BULB ACT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND YOU
NORTHERNERS, YOU NORTHERNERS
UP THERE WANT WARM NATURAL
FRL LIGHT GO SHOP AT YANKEE
CANDLE, YOU VANILLA SCENTED
DEVILS.
AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, IF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REFUSES
TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR RIGHTS TO
THIS PECULIAR INSTITUTION,
WE WILL JUST SELL THESE
LIGHT BULBS UNDER THE TABLE.
AFTER ALL, SOUTH CAROLINA
HAS PROVEN IT KNOWS HOW TO
