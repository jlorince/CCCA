[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK YOU HAVE MUCH.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN, NATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME -- WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST PRESENTED TONIGHT WITH LIMITED COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I'M STILL COMING DOWN FROM LAST NIGHT'S SUPERBOWL RAGER.
I HAD THE WHOLE WRECKING CREW OVER AND THEY BROUGHT IT.
AND BY IT, I MEAN A LOVELY SPINACH DIP BREAD BOWL, COURTESY OF LOU DAWG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WOOF WOOF!
THE DOG IS LOOSE!
THE DOG IS IN THE HOUSE!
AND WANTS HIS SERVING TRAY BACK AT SOME POINT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS A SUPERBOWL FOR THE AGES.
A PHOTO FINISH, SQUEAKER AT THE BUZZER, AAAAAND WHO WON?
WHO WON?
THE RAVENS.
THE RAVENS WON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD, GOOD.
PERFECT.
[ APPLAUSE ]
SOUNDS GREAT.
BONUS!
NOW RAY LEWIS HAS AS MANY SUPERBOWL RINGS AS MURDER INDICTMENTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVENS IT OUT.
BUT OF COURSE, THE REAL WINNERS WERE AMERICAN CONSUMERS, BECAUSE THE ADS KILLED IT THIS YEAR.
THEY HAD IT ALL:  A DORITOS-EATING GOAT,
[ LAUGHTER ]
A MAN OUTRUNNING A CHEETAH,
[ LAUGHTER ]
A GUY WHO LOST WEIGHT 15 YEARS AGO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THE TEARJERKER OF THE NIGHT WAS THE TOUCHING STORY OF A MAN'S LOVE FOR A HORSE.
AND THAT'S NOT JUST LOVE IN THE HORSE'S EYES.
IT'S ALSO GRATITUDE THAT IT WORKS FOR BUDWEISER AND NOT BURGER KING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THERE WAS ONE PART OF THE GAME I DIDN'T CARE FOR-- THE HALFTIME SHOW.
BEYONCE.
WAS SHE GREAT?
OF COURSE.
BUT  A YOUNG, VITAL SINGER AT THE TOP OF HER GAME IS JUST UNNATURAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TRADITIONAL SUPERBOWL HALFTIMES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ARTHRITIC LEGENDS DECADES PAST
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEIR PRIME SHAMBLING THROUGH THEIR CATALOG OF OLDIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN LOOK AT HER, SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE VISIBLE NECK WATTLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO SAD.
OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
>> WE HAVE A POWER OUTAGE AT THE SUPER DOME.
THERE WAS A SURGE IN THE BUILDING AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
>> BLACKOUT BOWL.
>> BLACKOUT BOWL.
>> BLACKOUT BOWL!
THE LIGHTS GO OUT FOR 35 MINUTES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, 35 MINUTES WITHOUT POWER.
ONLY TWO MONTHS SHORT OF NEW ORLEANS' PERSONAL BEST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY'LL GET THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO ONE'S SURE WHAT CAUSED THE OUTAGE, BUT I BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE STARTED WITH AN ELECTRICAL SHORT.
HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, COULD BE TROUBLE.
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE WIRING ON THAT THING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY EVENTUALLY GOT POWER RESTORED, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED.
THAT STOP DOWN WAS 35 MINUTES OF DARKNESS THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN FILLED WITH ADS.
AND DON'T TELL ME YOU COULDN'T FIND A SPONSOR.
BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT MANY OF MY BLACKOUTS ARE BROUGHT TO YOU BY CAPTAIN MORGAN.
