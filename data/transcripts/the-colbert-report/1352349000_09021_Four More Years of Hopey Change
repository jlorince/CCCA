LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG ELECTION.
LAST NIGHT, DUE TO THE TECHNICALITY CALLED THE CONSTITUTION, BARACK OBAMA WAS RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT.
THOUGH--  ( CHEERS ) ( APPLAUSE ) UH.
( BLEEP ) YOU.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, FOLKS, KEEP IN MIND, KEEP IN MIND, THIS WAS NO LANDSLIDE, FOLKS.
IT WAS LIKE A 51-49ER, OKAY.
JUST BECAUSE OBAMA WON THE BLUE STATES UP HERE, HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF ALL OF THEM NOW?
ROMNEY WON ALL THAT RED STUFF.
WHY DON'T WE ELECT OUR PRESIDENT ON SQUARE FOOTAGE, BECAUSE ROMNEY WON SOME BIG STATES,
FOLKS, WHOLE DAMN SOUTH.
LOUISIANA, N'AWLINS LOVES MI-RAWMNAH.
BUT, BUT, EVIDENTLY, HERE'S THE DEAL.
OF THE NINE KEY SWING STATES, BALM WON EIGHT.
I DON'T-- I MEAN HOW-- EVEN PENNSYLVANIA.
DESPITE THE FACT THAT AFTER A WEEK OF HURRICANE SANDY, THOUSANDS OF AMISH REMAIN
WITHOUT POWER.
( APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, ANYWAY, OBAMA WON.
AMERICA IS DONE.
IT'S OVER!
JIMMY, ROLL THE CREDITS.
