THE BIG STORYCONTINUES TO BE THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S TORTUREREPORT.
FOLKS, AMERICA IS A BEACON OFFREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD.
BUT THANKS TO THIS REPORT, NOWBRUTAL REGIMES ARE TALKING
SMACK -- LIKE THIS CRAP FROMCHINA.
"HOW LONG CAN THE U.S. PRETENDTO BE A HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION?"
OH, I'D SAY ABOUT AS LONG AS ICAN PRETEND I DON'T KNOW WHO
MADE MY iPhone.
IT'S ELVES, RIGHT?
THESE ARE TROUBLING QUESTIONS,AND IN TROUBLED TIMES, BILL
O'REILLY REMINDS US TO SHUT UPAND LET HIM TALK.
>> THERE ARE SOME FOLKS LIKE MEWHO BELIEVE WE MUST USE HARSH
MEASURES TO DEFEAT THE JIHADISTSWHO WOULD SLAUGHTER US ALL IF
THEY COULD.
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SAY WE MUSTOBEY THE GENEVA CONVENTION, EVEN
THOUGH WE ARE FIGHTING AN ENEMYTHAT DOES NOT FALL UNDER THAT
TREATY.
THEN THERE IS THE DEFINITION OFTORTURE.
SOME BELIEVE THAT SUBJECTING ACAPTIVE TO LOUD NOISE OR VERBAL
THREATS IS TORTURE.
SO IT'S USELESS TO BEBATE THEISSUE BECAUSE MINDS WILL NOT BE
CHANGED.
>> Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, ADEBATE THAT CANNOT BE DEBATED
BECAUSE MINDS WILL NOT BECHANGED CAN BE DEBATED ONLY BY
THE MOST UNCHANGEABLE MIND.
ME, STEPHEN COLBERT!
THIS IS FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FIRST OF ALL, WELCOME, STEPHEN.
>> GOOD TO BE BACK.
>> Stephen: STEPHEN, I LOOKEDIT UP, AND YOU AND I DEBATED
TORTURING DETAINEES IN THE VERYFIRST MONTH OF THIS SHOW MORE
THAN NINE YEARS AGO.
>> NINE YEARS?
WOW, YOU HAVEN'T AGED A BIT.
>> Stephen: AWWW...
YOU'RE A LIAR.
>> I AM.
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
>> Stephen: I KNOW!
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN UP FOR ALMOST AWEEK READING ABOUT HOW WE KEPT
PRISONERS UP FOR ALMOST A WEEK.
YOU LOOK SO WELL-RESTED.
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
>> I'LL SHOW YOU.
GIMME THAT.
(CHEERING)NOW YOU WILL SLEEP LIKE A BABY.
>> Stephen: NO, I WON'T!
SOME PARTS OF THAT REPORT AREREALLY DISTURBING!
>> WHICH PARTS?
>> Stephen: THE WORDS.
CHAINING AND BEATING,CONFINEMENT IN COFFIN-SIZED
BOXES, SOMETHING CALLED "RECTALREHYDRATION"?
>> WELL, C'MON, MAN, NO ONELIKES A THIRSTY RECTUM.
>> Stephen: GRANTED.
I JUST DON'T LIKE TO THINK OFAMERICA AS A TORTURE NATION.
>> WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS.
IT'S JUST THAT, AFTER 9/11, OURFEAR AND ANGER TEMPORARILY
CHANGED US INTO A DIFFERENT GUY.
>> Stephen: OH!
LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK?
>> EXACTLY.
DON'T MAKE US ANGRY.
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE US WHEN WE'REANGRY.
BUT NOW WE'RE BACK TO BEINGBRUCE BANNER, SO WE CAN'T BE
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE HULK'SHARSH INTERROGATION METHODS.
>> Stephen: OR HIS TINY PANTS.
YEAH, AND AS USUAL, BILLO'REILLY PUT IT MOST --
>> LOOK, WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR.
I HAVE A BOOK ON WORLD WAR II,"KILLING PATTON," SO I KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN WAR.
THE TRUTH IS MISTAKES WERE MADE,BUT THEY WERE MADE IN THE FOG OF
WAR TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO MISSTHAT GOOD MAN.
>> HE'S NOT GOING OFF THE AIR.
YOU ARE.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BUT NO ONE'SGONNA PAY ME TO WATCH HIM
ANYMORE.
SO (BLEEP) THAT NOISE.
>> YOU HAVE TO ADMIT BILL'SRIGHT.
YOU CAN'T JUDGE WHAT HAPPENS INTHE "FOG OF WAR."
>> Stephen: WHAT FOG?
THIS WASN'T LOW-LEVEL TROOPSMAKING SPLIT-SECOND DECISIONS IN
A FREE-FIRE ZONE.
IT WAS OVER SEVEN YEARS OFLAWYERS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF
GOVERNMENT WRITING LEGAL BRIEFSABOUT SIMULATED DROWNING...
>> SORRY, STEPHEN.
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
IT'S TOO DAMN "FOG OF WAR" INHERE.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN'T HEAR MEBECAUSE IT'S FOGGY?
>> CAN'T HEAR YOU!
FOGGY!
>> Stephen: YOU'RE HOLDING A(BLEEP) FOG MACHINE!
>> OH, THIS?
I DIDN'T SEE THAT BECAUSE OF THE"FOG OF FOG."
>> Stephen: LOOK, FOG OR NOFOG, WE SAID WE DON'T TORTURE,
AND NOW THE WORLD THINKS WE'RETHE BAD GUYS.
>> THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLEKNOW ABOUT IT.
THINK OF IT THIS WAY, EVERYBODYTHINKS YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON,
RIGHT?
>> Stephen: I HOPE SO.
BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE FOUND OUTWHAT HAPPENED "THAT" SUMMER UP
AT MAYFLOWER LAKE?
>> Stephen: WE AGREED WE WOULDNEVER TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT MAYFLOWER LAKE.
>> EXACTLY, BECAUSE WE'RE GOODPEOPLE, AND NOTHING HAPPENED,
BECAUSE IT HAD TO.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
MR. JENKINS SLIPPED AND HIT HISHEAD ON THAT ROCK TO PROTECT THE
OTHER KIDS.
>> YES, THE ROCK, WHICH ISCONSISTENT WITH BLUNT FORCE
TRAUMA.
>> Stephen: AND WE AGREED ONTHAT STORY AND SEALED IT WITH
THE MAYFLOWER PREP SECRETHANDSHAKE.
>> MAYFLOWER BOYS DO NOT DOMURDER...
>> Stephen: AND WILL NOTDISCUSS IT FURTHER...
>> PA-CHANG!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)POINT IS -- AMERICA DOES NOT
TORTURE.
BUT WE "HAD" TO.
AND WE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN,UNLESS IT'S TO PROTECT AMERICA.
>> Stephen: BUT THE REPORTSAYS IT DIDN'T PROTECT AMERICA.
>> OH, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THEACTUAL COUNTRY.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE "IDEA" OFAMERICA.
THE "IDEA" OF AMERICA WOULDNEVER TORTURE.
>> Stephen: AND THE ACTUALAMERICA?
>> HAVE YOU READ THAT REPORT?
WE PUMPED HUMMUS UP PEOPLE'SBUTTS.
I'M NO IMAM, BUT I'M PRETTY SURETHAT'S NOT HALAL.
AND THAT, MY FRIEND, IS WHY ICHOSE TO LIVE IN THE "IDEA" OF
AMERICA.
>> Stephen: AH-HA!
BUT THE IDEA OF AMERICA IS JUSTAN IMAGINARY PLACE.
WHICH MEANS YOU, SIR, ARE JUSTAN IMAGINARY STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> AND YOU,  SIR...
(FADING AWAY)>> -- HAVE BEEN A FORMIDABLE
OPPONENT!
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK.
