FOLKS, WHEN YOU ASK A DOG WAS'S ON TOP OF A HOUSE, HE SAYS ROOF.
WHEN YOU ASK AN ALPHA DOG WAS'S ON TOP OF A HOUSE HE SAY WAS DO I LOOK LIKE, A
[BLEEP] ARCHITECT?
THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK.
IT IS NO SECRET-- FOLK, IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR CITIES ARE SUFFERING A MASSIVE BUDGET CRISIS.
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE TO CUT BACK ON FIRE DEPARTMENTS,
BOARDS OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY.
IN MANY CITIES THE POLICE HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY A GUN DUCT TAPED TO A ROOMBA.
BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION THANKS TO OUR ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK,
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY MAYOR,
COREY BOOKER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LAST WEEK MAYOR BOOKER FOUND HIMSELF IN A LIFE-AND-DEATH GAME OF FETCH.
AND TURNED OUT TO BE A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.
>> MAYOR TO THE RESCUE,
COREY BOOKER RACING INTO A NEIGHBOR'S BURNING HOUSE,
PROMPTING THROUGH SMOKE AND FLAMES TO SAVE'S WOMAN'S LIFE.
>> HE RAN IN, AND WITHOUT THINKING FOR HIS OWN SAFETY.
>> HE ACTUALLY PUNCHED HIS FIST THROUGH A KITCHEN WALL,
GRABBED THIS WOMAN, THREW OVER HIS SHOULDER AND RAN THROUGH FLAMES.
>> THE NEIGHBOR DID WHAT MOST NEIGHBOR WAS DO, WHICH IS TO JUMP INTO ACTION TO HELP A FRIEND.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY, LIKE THE TIME MY NEIGHBOR ALLEN'S HOUSE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND I
DROVE MY CAR AWAY FROM IT SO HE WOULD NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE.
(LAUGHTER) GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
AND THIS ALPHA DOG HAS A HISTORY OF LIFTING HIS LEG ON DANGER.
>> IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE MAYOR HAS SERVED HIS CONSTITUENTS IN UNUSUAL WAYS.
FROM PERSONALLY HELPING NEWARK RESIDENTS SHOVEL SNOW TO CHASING DOWN A SUSPECTED ROBBER.
>> Stephen: HE IS SO HANDS ON.
ONE TIME HE EVEN PULLED HIMSELF OVER AND THEN SUED HIMSELF FOR RACIAL PROFILING.
(LAUGHTER) THIS BIG DOG HAS SHOWN US HOW TO NEUTER BIG CITY BUDGETS, FIRE ALL THE
MUNICIPAL WORKERS AND LET OUR ELECTED OFFICIAL DOES THEIR JOBS.
I MEAN WHY CAN'T NEW YORK MAYOR MIKE BLOOMBERG DRIVE A BUS?
IF HE SITS ON A STACK OF OLD PHONE BOOKS I BET HE CAN SEE OVER THE STEERING WHEEL.
(LAUGHTER) SO COREY BOOKER--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: COREY BOOKER,
FOR RUNNING INTO A BURNING HOUSE AND MAKING THE FIRE ENGINE CHASE YOU, YOU, SIR,
ARE MY
