NATION.
WE ALL KNOW THE OBAMA REGIME ISDOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO
UNDERMINE THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
SURE, OBAMA HASN'T UNDERMINED ITYET, BUT HE ALSO HASN'T
UNDERMINED THE FIRST AMENDMENTSO GUN LOVERS STILL HAVE THE
FREEDOM TO SAY HE'S UNDERMININGTHE SECOND AMENDMENT WITHOUT ANY
EVIDENCE WHICH MAKES US LOOKNUTS, THEREBY UNDERMINING THE
SECOND AMENDMENT.
IT'S ALL A LONG CON.
SO I WAS THRILLED TO SPENDYESTERWEEKEND WITH LIKE-MINDED
PATRIOTS AT THE N.R.A.'S 2014ANNUAL MEETING IN INDIANAPOLIS.
IT WAS OVER NINE ACRES OF GUNS,GEAR, AND OUTFITTERS THAT
FEATURED INNOVATIVE PRODUCTSLIEB THE STALKING SHIELD FOR THE
ETHICAL HUNTER WHO WANTS TOENSURE THEY CALL ONLY THE
STUPIDEST MEMBERS OF THE HERD.
THE STALKING SHIELD THEY'LLNEVER TRUST A TREE AGAIN.
THE CONVENTION ALSO FEATURESSPEAKERS LIKE LOUISIANA GOVERNOR
AND BOY WHO WISHED TO BE BIG,BOBBY JINDAL.
WHO MADE IT CLEAR THE STAKESFACING THE N.R.A. COULD NOT BE
HIGHER.
>> THE SAME LIBERAL EXTREMISTSWHO WANT TO COME TAKE OUR GUNS
ARE THE SAME FORCES THAT WANT TOTAKE AWAY OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
>> Stephen:  EXACTLY!
IF WE CAVE ON GUN CONTROL, NEXTCOMES RELIGION CONTROL, WHICH
MEANS A THREE-DAY WAITING PERIODBEFORE I CAN BUY A BIBLE.
THEN WHAT WILL I PUT IN MYBREAST POCKET TO MIRACULOUSLY
PROTECT ME FROM ALL THE STRAYBULLETS FLYING AROUND.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, ALSO ON THE LECTERN OF
PEOPLE WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE INTHE NEIGHBORHOOD CARING ABOUT
GUNS AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'MNOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WAS
FORMER, FORMER SENATOR RICKSANTORUM WHO TALKED ABOUT THE
CRUCIAL ROLE GUNS PLAY IN ANYHAPPY MARRIAGE.
>> KAREN OWNS MORE GUNS THAN IDO.
DON'T KNOW ABOUT MOST MEN, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE DEFAULT GIFT
FOR MOST MEN IS TO BUY FLOWERSON A SPECIAL OCCASION.
FOR ME, THE SAFE BET-- AMMO.
>> Stephen:  YES.
WHY SAY IT WITH FLOWERS WHEN YOUCAN SAY IT WITH BULLETS?
IT'S THE GIFT THAT GOES STRAIGHTTO SOMEONE ELSE'S HEART.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND, FOLKS--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
A LOT OF AMMO FANS HERE TONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )AND IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN
EVER FOR THESE HEROS TO STAND UPFOR OUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
AND/OR PLASTIC OAK-BARK TUNICS.
BECAUSE THIS IS A CRITICAL TIMEFOR THE MOST IMPORTANT GUN RIGHT
OF ALL, CONCEALED CARRY.
WHICH IS GUARANTEED BY OURCONSTITUTION.
NOW, YES, YOU CAN'T SEE ITWRITTEN IN THERE.
THAT'S CAUSE IT'S CONCEALED.
( LAUGHTER )SO I WAS HAPPY TO SEE GEORGIA'S
GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL STAND UPFOR THE RIGHT TO ROCK OUT WITH
YOUR GLOCK NOT OUT.
>> GEORGIA'S GOVERNOR HAS SIGNEDA CONTROVERSIAL GUN BILL INTO
LAW.
>> STARTING JULY 1, PEOPLE INGEORGIA CAN BRING FIREMANS INTO
BARS, LIBRARIES, CHURCHES ANDEVEN SOME GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.
>> ITS OFFICIAL NAME IS THE"SAFE CARRY PROTECTION ACT."
BUT CRITICS CALL IT THE GUNSEVERYWHERE BILL.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, CRITICS CALL ITTHE GUNS EVERYWHERE BILL.
WHILE SUPPORTERS CALL IT THEGUNS, EVERYBODY, BILL!
AND WITH THIS LAW, WITH THISLAW-- I ASSUME THEY YELL THAT AT
SOMEONE NAMED BILL.
WITH THIS LAW, GEORGIANS WILL BEABLE TO BRING THEIR GUNS TO
SCHOOLS, BARS, CHURCHES, ANDLIBRARIES.
OF COURSE, THERE YOU WILL WANTTO USE A SILENCER.
BUT BEST OF ALL, BEST OF ALL,FOLKS, YOU CAN NOW EVEN PACK
HEAT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THEAIRPORT, WHICH WILL FINALLY
ALLOW YOU TO DEFEND THAT ONESEAT WITH AN OUTLET.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
SHOCKINGLY-- ( CHEERS )
SHOCKINGLY, SHOCKINGLY, THE GUNSEVERYWHERE BILL DOESN'T COVER
SOME EVERYWHERES.
YES IT BROADENS CONCEALEDCARRY, ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMESWITH GUNS.
BUT ONLY AFTER THEY'RE OUT OFJAIL.
WHY CAN'T THEY CARRY GUNS INPRISON?
THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED THEM.
THAT PLACE IS FULL OF CRIMINALS!
THIS GUNS EVERYWHERE BILL IS AGOOD START, BUT IT STILL
REQUIRES YOU TO CARRY A GUN TOHAVE A GUN.
THAT'S WHY I SAY WE MUST BROADENGUNS EVERYWHERE TO EVERYWHERE IS
GUNS.
ALL BUILDINGS IN AMERICA MUSTPROVIDE CONCEALED WEAPONS IN
EVENT OF A NONGUN-HAVINGEMERGENCY.
JUST USE THE GUN ON THE CHAIN TOSHOOT THE GLASS AND GRAB THE
GUN.
( APPLAUSE )BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A
BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUYWITH A GUN.
AND IF EVERYBODY HAS A GUN,CHANCES ARE, AT LEAST ONE OF
THEM WILL BE GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
