[LAUGHTER]
NATION, NEXT UP ON NOT AMERICA, FOOTBALL IS GETTING A LOT OF HEAT ABOUT TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES.
I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.
I PLAYED AS A KID AND I'M PURPLY SPATULA.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM PILING ON, TELLING THE NEW REPUBLIC, "IF I
HAD A SON, I'D HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE I LET HIM PLAY FOOTBALL." OH, REALLY, SIR?
WELL FOOTBALL DOESN'T WANT YOUR IMAGERY SON BECAUSE HE THROWS LIKE AN IMAGERY GIRL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SADLY, THE SPECTRE OF CHILDHOOD BRAIN DAMAGE THREATENS THE FUTURE OF FOOTBALL.
SO CLEARLY, WE HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THIS CRISIS BY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
THIS IS "THE SPORT REPORT."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[HUMMING]
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I'M NO FAN BUT SOCCER IS EUROPE'S MOST POPULAR SPORT, RIGHT BEHIND COMPETITIVE THREE-WAYS.
[LAUGHTER]
INCREDIBLE BALL HANDLING.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NOW THERE'S A DARK CLOUD ON SOCCER'S HORIZON.
>> HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCCER MATCHES MAY HAVE BEEN FIXED.
>> WE'RE TALKING WORLD CUP QUALIFIERS, EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS QUALIFIERS.
THESE TOURNAMENTS DON'T COME ANY BIGGER AND MORE PRESTIGIOUS THAN THIS.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 680 SUSPICIOUS GAMES INVOLVING 425 MATCH OFFICIALS, CLUB OFFICIALS,
PLAYERS, KNOWN CRIMINALS FROM SOME 15 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
I MEAN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE.
>> Stephen: I'M SHOCKED.
[LAUGHTER]
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS ANYTHING FAKE ABOUT SOCCER?
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A GAME OF SUCH INTEGRITY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, THIS GAME-FIXING STARTED OUT SUBTLY, BUT AUTHORITIES BEGAN TO SUSPECT SOMETHING WAS
WRONG WHEN INSTEAD OF RED AND YELLOW CARDS, REFEREES BEGAN HOLDING PLATINUM CARDS.
AND THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED SCANDAL.
RUSSIAN MOBSTERS "HAVE TARGETED EVERY LEVEL OF THE GAME.
THE WORLD CUP ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SEMIPRO GAMES IN THE SOCCER WILDERNESS.
SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU DROP OFF KATIE AT HER MATCH AGAINST THE McKINLEY TITANS, WATCH OUT FOR A
GUY WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT AND A BRIEFCASE FULL OF ORANGE SLICES.
[LAUGHTER]
THE MATCH FIXING EVEN WENT ON IN THE CROWN JEWEL OF EUROPEAN SOCCER, THE U-AYFA CHAMPIONS
-- IF THAT'S HOW YOU SAY IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE U-AYFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE.
IN A GAME AGAINST LIVERPOOL, A HUNGARIAN TEAM'S GOALKEEPER WAS, PAID TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE
MORE THAN TWO GOALS SCORED IN THE MATCH.
BUT LIVERPOOL WON BY THE SCORE OF ONE TO ZERO.
WHICH GOES TO SHOW, NO ONE MAN CAN BE MORE CORRUPT THAN SOCCER IS BORING.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THE FIXERS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND THE FIXERS ALSO PAID OFF REFEREES, OFTEN IN SUBTLE WAYS.
LIKE WHEN ALL SEVEN GOALS IN TWO MATCHES CAME FROM PENALTY KICKS AWARDED BY REFEREES, OR A
LATVIAN GAME WHERE AFTER A PLAYER MISSED A PENALTY KICK, THE REFEREE ORDERED THAT IT BE RETAKEN.
