>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN
PROFESSOR WITH THE NEW BOOKTHE STORY OF THE HUMAN BODY
EVOLUTION, HEALTH ANDDISEASE.
>> I PICKED HEALTH.
>> PLEASE WELCOME DANIELLIEBERMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU, HOW
ARE YOU, NICE TO SEE YOUAGAIN, DANIEL.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE SHOWBEFORE, TALKED ABOUT
BAREFOOT RUN LAST TIME.
>> YES.
>> IT IS GETTING COLD, IPREFER TO WEAR SOCKS WHEN IT
IS COLD.
I'M JUST GETTING OLD AND THEOLDER YOU GET THE MORE A
CRAVE WARMTH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ONE OFTHE THINGS THAT MOD HIRNL
DOES THAT OLD HUMANS DIDN'TDO, WE GET OLD, RIGHT.
THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGESWE HAVE OVER THEM, WE CAN
JUST, IN A FIGHT WE CAN JUSTOUTLAST THEM.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> WHAT IS INTERESTING ISTHE HUNTERS GATHERERS, NASTY
MISERABLE LIVES.
>> Stephen: THEY DID.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, THEHUNTER GATHERERS IF THEY
SURVIVED CHILDHOOD THEY HADPRETTY HIGH CHILDHOOD
MORTALITY RATES BUT IF THEYSURVIVED THEY LIVED TO THEIR
60s, 70s AND 80s AND WEREEXTRAORDINARILY HEALTHY AS
FAR AS WE COULD TELL.
THEY HAD HEART DISEASE.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TYPE IIDIABETES.
OSTEOPOROSIS.
WE'VE GOT THEM ALL.
>> Stephen: WE GOT THAT ONTHEM.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THEY ONLY HADONE TYPE OF DIABETES.
>> THEY NEVER NEEDEDOBAMACARE.
YEAH, BECAUSE THEY, YOU KNOWWHAT, THEY LIVED PRETTY LONG
AND VERY HEALTHY LIVES.
AND ALTHOUGH THEY DID GETSICK, THEY DIDN'T GET THE
KIND OF CHRONICNONINFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT
WE GET TODAY.
>> Stephen: WELL, EVERYTHINGYOU ARE SAYING, I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU BUT EVERYTHINGARE YOU SAYING IS IN YOUR
NEW BOOK THE STORY OF THEHUMAN BODY, EVOLUTION,
HEALTH AND DISEASE.
IS OUR BODY, ARE OUR BODIESCHANGING NOW.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE, YOUKNOW, I THOUGHT EVOLUTION
WAS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
>> WELL, TO SOME EXTENT ITIS, YES.
SO EVOLUTION IS, OCCURS INMULTIPLE WAYS.
ONE KIND OF EVOLUTION ISTHAT, NATURAL SELECTION WHAT
DARWIN WROTE ABOUT, THERE ISVARIATION, SOME OF THE
VARIATIONS LIKE YOU PROBABLYLOOK A BIT LIKE YOUR PARENTS
I IMAGINE BECAUSE YOUINHERITED GENES FROM THEM.
AND THEN LOTS OF SIBLINGS,SOME OF YOU INHERITED
DIFFERENT GENES FROM YOURPARENTS THAN OTHER ONES AND
SOME HAD MORE KIDS THANOTHERS.
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HADGENES THAT BENEFITTED YOU IN
TERMS OF HAVING MOREOFFSPRING, ARE YOU GOING TO
PASS THOSE GENES ONPREFERENTIALALLY TO THE NEXT
GENERATION SO, THAT ISNATURAL SELECTION.
>> Stephen: IF YOU ACCEPTNATURAL SELECTION.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE IT ISTHE THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND
A ASSUME THAT THIS BOOK ISON THE PRO THEORY SIDE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
A LOT OF BOOKS ARE AGAINSTIT, THIS IS ONE-ON-ONE SIDE
THERE ARE A LOT AGAINSTxD IT.
>> AT LEAST I'M ON THE SAMESIDE AS THE POPE SO IT'S
OKAY.
BUT ANYWAY-- .
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO WIN ANY POINTS BY TALKING
ABOUT THE POPE WITH ME, OKAY,THAT GUY IS ALSO PRO POOR,
BUT GO AHEAD.
>> THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OFEVOLUTION.
IT'S CULTURAL EVOLUTION.
SO OUR CULTURES�� CHANGE TOO.
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW,IF YOU HAD BEEN GIVING THERE
SHOW IN THE 17th OR 18thCENTURY YOU WOULD BE WEARING
A REALLY FANTASTIC WIG.
>> Stephen: I WOULD BEBURNED AS A WITCH BECAUSE TV
DIDN'T EXIST BACK THEN.
>> EXACTLY AND SPENDING ALOT OF MONEY ON THAT POWDER
AND THAT KIND OF STUFF.
BUT WE GREW BEYOND THAT WENO LONGER WEAR WIGS, OTHER
THINGS IN OUR CULTURECONSTANTLY CHANGED.
>> Stephen: GAY MARRIAGE.
>> GAY MARRIAGE, EXACTLY.
ALL KINDS OF THINGS ARECHANGE�� AND THOSE CHANGES
AFFECT OUR BODIES, SOME OFTHEM, GAY MARRIAGE OBVIOUSLY
AFFECTS OUR BODIES.
>> Stephen: OBVIOUSLY.
EVER SINCE GAY MARRIAGE ISLEGAL I KEEP GAINING WEIGHT.
>> IT'S LIKE SUGAR.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
TRANSFAT WA, ABOUT OUR DIET,OUR DIET HAS CHANGED.
>> HE NOR LOSELY.
INCREDIBLY SINCEINDUSTRIALIZATION, SO THE
FIRST BIG SHIFT IN OUR DIETWAS REALLY AGRICULTURE
REVOLUTION SO, WE STARTEDGROWING FOOD.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE WETALKING ABOUT, 1960s?
>> WELL, IT STARTED ABOUT600 GENERATIONS AGO SO.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT,1940s.
>> 1940s, 10,000 YEARSBEFORE THAT.
>> Stephen: 10,000 YEARS AGOWE STARTED GROWING CORN.
>> WELL, YES, IN THE MIDDLEEAST YOU STARTED GROWING
BARLEY AND WHEAT IN CHINARICE AND IN THE NEAR EAST,
IN MESSO AMERICA WE STARTEDGROWING CORN BUT THAT IS
ONLY 6-GENERATIONS AGO THATIS THE NUMBER OF GENERATIONS
OF MISE THAT HAVE LIVED INMY BASEMENT IN THE LAST 100
YEARS.
>> Stephen: WOW, YOU GOT APROBLEM.
>> ACTUALLY, WE DO.
AND I'M CONSTANTLY OUT THEREWITH MY MOUSE TRAPS.
BUT ANYWAY, BUT WHAT HASHAPPENED IS THAT THAT IS
ACTUALLY NOT THATCH TIME.
WE'VE HE VOLUME OFED SINCETHEN.
THERE HAVE BEEN ADAPTATION,FOR EXAMPLE WHEN MY
ANCESTORS AND MAYBE YOURANCESTORS ADAPTIONS TO DRINK
MILK, SO THAT IS A NATURALSELECTION.
BUT-- .
>> Stephen: THEY GOT THATHEAT VISION.
>> YES, WOULDN'T THAT BECOOL.
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THECOIN IS THAT THERE IS A LOT
OF CHANGES THAT WE HAVE HADTHAT WHICH WE HAVEN'T
ADAPTED FOR.
AND SO WE GET WHAT WE CALLMISMATCH DISEASE, DISEASES
IN WHICH OUR BODIES AREINADEQUATELY ADAPTED TO THE
MAD EARN WORLD AND SUGAR ISONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES.
WE CANNOT HANDLE FOODS THATHAVE A LOT OF SUGAR.
>> Stephen: BUT EVOLUTIONARILY, DON'T WE CRAVE SUGAR,
ISN'T THAT THE REASON WHY ITTASTES SO GREAT TO US.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS EVOLUTIONKILLING US?
>> IN A WAY, IN A WAY IT'SBECAUSE OF EVOLUTION THAT WE
CRAVE SUGAR BECAUSE SUGAR ISFULL OF ENERGY.
AND IF YOU ARE A HUNTERGATHERERER YOU ARE BARELY
SURVIVING IT IS GREAT TOWANT AS MUCH SUGAR AS YOU
CAN, HUNTERS LOVE HONEY,THEY WILL EAT AS MUCH AS
THEY CAN BUT THEY DON'T GETTHAT MUCH.
MOST OF THE FOOD IS A ABOUTAS SWEET AS A CARROT.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUTTRANSFATS, DID THEY HAVE
THAT.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE TRANSFATSAS YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: I DID NOT KNOW,I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.
>> TRANSFATS WERE INVENTEDVERY RECENTLY AND OUR BODIES
CANNOT HANDLE THEM.
JUST LYING SUGAR.
>> Stephen: THEY ARE ILLEGALIN NEW YORK, LIKE NEW YORK
CITY THEY CAN'T HAVETRANSFATS.
>> GOOD FOR NEW YORK.
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TODO.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THATANTI-EVOLUTIONARY BECAUSE IF
WE DON'T EAT THE TRANSFAT WEWON'T KNOW WHO CAN SURVIVE
EATING TRANSFAT TO PASS THATEVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE ON TO
OUR CHILDREN, THEN WE WOULDHAVE A SUPERRACE THAT CAN
EAT TRANSFAT.
FANNED WE CAN SURVIVETRANSFATS, NOTHING CAN KILL
US.
>> THE ONLY WAY THAT YOUREXPERIMENT WILL WORK, IF YOU
EVER GET APPROVAL FOR ITWHICH DOUBT, IS, IS IF
EATING TRANSFATS AFFECTEDYOUR ABILITY TO HAVE
OFFSPRING BECAUSE ALLNATURAL SELECTION CARES
ABOUT IS HOW MANY OFFSPRING.
AND MOST OF THE DISEASE YOUGET FROM TRANSFATS DON'T HIT
YOU UNTIL YOU ARE AGRANDPARENT.
>> Stephen: IF WE TOOK AWAYTHE THINGS THAT WERE CAUTION
ME TO BE SICK FROM BEING OLDHOW MUCH OLDER COULD I LIVE.
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO LIVEFOREVER.
>> WE HAVEN'T FIGURED THATONE OUT YET BUT MAYBE
SCIENTISTS IN WHITE LABCOATS WILL DO THAT BUT I
THINK THAT IS UNLIKELY.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKETO LIVE LONGER.
>> YEAH, PROBABLY.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG WOULDYOU LIKE TO LIVE.
>> I WOULD THINK 92.
THAT'S PERFECT, YEAH.
>> Stephen: I WOULD LIKETHAT TOO.
NOW I WANT TO LIVE 93, TOBEAT�r YOU.
THANK YOU SOME OF FORJOINING ME.
