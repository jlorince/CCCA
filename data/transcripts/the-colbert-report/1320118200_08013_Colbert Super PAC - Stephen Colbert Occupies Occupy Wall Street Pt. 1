WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A FLAT
TAX, WATCH OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
, SO FOLKS, RECENTLY I WENT DOWN
TO OCCUPY WALL STREET TO OFFER
THEM THIS EXCITING
CO-OPPORTUNITY.
I ARRIVED AT ZUCOTTI PARK READY
FOR A REVOLUTION.
MY MISSION: BLEND IN.
BECOME ONE OF THEM AND HOPEFULLY
EARN THEIR TRUST.
I HAD TO FIND A WAY INTO THEIR
WORLD.
JUST AS THE SKIES OPENED UP, SO
DID MY WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY.
IT WAS TIME FOR A CALL TO ACTION
TEND LOCKOUT.
END IT.
I WAS MAKING CONNECTIONS.
DO YOU GUYS BELIEVE WALL STREET
PLANNED THIS RAIN?
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
>> STOP THE RAIN!
STOP THE WALL STREET RAIN!
>> AS I LEFT THE PARK, I HAD A
REAL SENSE OF WHAT THESE YOUNG
PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING FOR.
WHERE'S THE LIMO?
I HAD FOUND MY REBELS.
TWO YOUNG IDEALISTS WHO COULD
GET ME INSIDE THE MOVEMENT.
I INVITED THESE OCCUPIERS TO
OCCUPY MY PENTHOUSE SUITE
OVERLOOKING ZUCOTTI PARK.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME
TODAY.
>> I WILL, STEPHEN, THANK YOU.
LET'S JUST GET YOUR NAMES HERE,
YOU ARE?
>> JUSTIN RIVAS.
>> AND YOU ARE KETCHUP.
>> Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
MISHEARD THAT.
>> KETCHUP.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A LAST
NAME, KETCHUP?
>> I HAVE ONE.
I'D PREFER NOT TO SAY ON CAMERA.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU WANTED BY
THE POLICE?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU AFRAID OF
BRINGING SHAME UPON YOUR FAMILY?
>> UM....
>> Stephen: IS IT A DIFFICULT
NAME?
>> IT'S THIS I....
>> Stephen: IS IT HIT SFLER
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NOT KETCHUP HITLER.
>> NO, NOT KETCHUP HITLER.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
I WANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO CAN
MAKE SOME DECISIONS.
>> WE CAN'T DO THAT FOR YOU.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHY AM I TALKING TO
YOU TWO?
>> THEY CAME TO CONSENSUS WITHIN
THE PRESS GROUP THAT WE WOULD BE
TWO PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE GOOD TO
TALK TO BUT WE'RE JUST HERE AS
AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUALS.
>> Stephen: SO WHO SPEAKS FOR
THE MOVEMENT?
>> NO ONE.
>> Stephen: DO IT.
>>
>> WHAT I'M THERE TO DO....
>> Stephen: SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY.
>> I CAN'T.
>> Stephen: YES, YOU CAN.
>> THIS IS A TEMPERATURE
CHECK....
>> Stephen: A TEMPERATURE CHECK?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WILL RECALLLY OR
RECTALLY.
>> Stephen:
>> IF PEOPLE AGREE THEY DEAL
THIS.
>> Stephen: SO RETACKILY.
>> IF THEY DISAGREE AND NOT
FEELING IT THEY'LL DO THIS.
>> Stephen:?
WHY
>> BECAUSE WE WANT TO GAUGE IF
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO CONSENSUS
>> Stephen: I SEE A LOT OF
ANTI-CORPORATE STUFF DOWN THERE.
WHAT'S YOUR BEEF WITH SUCCESSFUL
PEOPLE?
>> I LOOK AROUND AT THE WORLD
THAT I'M IN AND I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I SEE BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO
LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WHERE MY
OWN HAPPINESS AND COMFORT ARE
NOT BORNE OUT OF THE SUFFERING
OF OTHERS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF
THE ENVIRONMENT.
>> SOMEONE CALL FOR THIS?
>> Stephen: COMING!
(LAUGHTER)
SURE, JUST BRING IN IT.
OKAY.
THANKS.
AHH.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING?
STEAK AND EGGS?
BY A COB, SAUSAGE?
(LAUGHTER)
SO... OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS GOOD.
GO ON.
>> THEY HAVE ALL THIS MONEY AND
THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE ALL OVER
THE WORLD ARE SUFFERING AND
HUNGRY AND COLD AND THEY ARE
CHOOSING NOT TO DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT OR CERTAINLY NOT TO DO
ENOUGH ABOUT IT.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I SEE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH
THAT ETHICALLY AND....
>> Stephen: OKAY, LET'S CUT
THROUGH THE BULL (BLEEP) HERE
FOR A SECOND.
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU PEOPLE ARE.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR
MESSAGE IS OR WHERE THIS IS
GOING BUT I WANT IN.
WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR ME
TO BE PART OF THIS?
>> YOU NEED TO COME DOWN TO THE
PARK, STEPHEN.
YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR VOICE
HEARD.
>> Stephen: DO YOU ACTUALLY VOTE
OR JUST DO THIS?
IS THERE ANY VOTING?
>> THERE'S CONSENSUS BUILDING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> WHEN A PROPOSAL IS BROUGHT
FORWARD AND THE DISCUSSION HAS
BEEN HAD AND CONCERNS ARE
BROUGHT UP AND POSSIBLE BLOCKS
ARE BROUGHT UP....
>> Stephen: WHAT'S A BLOCK?
>> A BLOCK IS THIS?
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THIS?
>> POINT OF PROCESS.
LET'S SAY WE'RE ON AN AGENDA
TOPIC....
>> Stephen: WHAT WOULD BE AN
AGENDA TOP SNICK
>> FOR EXAMPLE....
>> Stephen: RICH ARE BAD.
>> NO, AN AGENDA TOPIC MIGHT
BE....
>> Stephen: ARE THEY BAD?
>> SEE, I MIGHT MAKE A POINT OF
PROCESS HERE.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO BLOCK
THAT.
>> YOU CAN'T.
A POINT OF PROCESS OVERRULES
EVERYTHING....
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE THE
LEADING OF THIS DISCUSSION?
>> I'M FACILITATING.
>> Stephen: YOU BLOCKED.
>> YOU BLOCKED.
>> Stephen: NO, I HAVE TO STAY
ON THE ROPES OVER HERE.
>> MIC CHECK.
THIS IS THE FACILITATOR WE'VE
EMPOWERED HER TO LEAD THE
DISCUSSION AND KEEP IT MOVING.
YOU NEED TO RESPECT THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING, THAT'S NOT THE STATED
AGENDA POINTS SOMEONE MIGHT DO A
POINT OF PROCESS TO SAY, YOU
KNOW, RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON A
DIFFERENT TOPIC.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS SEEM LIKE A
CULT.
>> WE'RE NOT A CULT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT A CULT.
THAT'S WHAT A CULT WOULD SAY.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO
THINK ABOUT THIS MOVEMENT....
>> Stephen: OR CULT.
>> I BELIEVE IT'S A MOVEMENT.
PEOPLE ARE SPONTANEOUSLY
ACTIVATING, DECIDING, MAKING THE
DECISION TO JOIN GENERAL
ASSEMBLYS IN CITIES ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.
>> I AM APART OF TWO CAUCUSES
AND PART OF WHY CAUCUSES EXIST
IS TO GIVE A SPACE FOR
MARGINALIZED VOICES.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU A
MARGINALIZED VOICE?
>> I AM A FEMALE-BODIED
PERSON....
>> Stephen: WHAT YOU ARE?
SORRY.
>> I'M A FEMALE-BODIED PERSON.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> IT'S A PERSON WHO HAS A
FEMALE FORM.
YOU....
>> Stephen: YOU TALKING ABOUT...
(LAUGHTER)
LADY BUMPS?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT YOU GOT DOWN THERE?
>> WHAT DO I GOT?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> I WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY
RELATIONS COMMITTEE.
>> Stephen: WHAT BODYED ARE YOU
>> I'M MALE BODIED.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALE BODIED
AND MALE OR FEMALE BODIESED OR
FEMALE?
>> NOT ALL PEOPLE WITH FEMALE
BODIES IDENTIFY AS WOMEN.
>> Stephen: SO IF I MEET
SOMEBODY DOWN THERE WHO SAYS
THEY'RE A WOMAN, I COULD BE IN
FOR A RUDE SURPRISE.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE FEMALE
BODIED.
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO TRUST
YOUR INSTINCTS ON THAT ONE.
>> Stephen: I GENERALLY DO, BUT
I'VE BEEN BURNED BEFORE.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
THE LEADER QSHGS DO YOU HAVE
ONE?
>> WE DON'T HAVE ONE.
>> Stephen: LET'S CREATE ONE, I
NOMINATE ME.
IS THERE A SECOND?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I DON'T EVER GET CONSENSUS.
>> Stephen: I HEARD A SECOND.
IT'S ME, I'M YOUR LEADER.
>> I WOULD BLOCK THAT ONE.
>> Stephen: BUT I POINT OF
ORDERED IT AND I PUT IT UP FOR
SUPERCONSIDERATION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO GOOD.
>> Stephen: IT PASSED OVER THE
STORMY SEAS OF YOUR BLOCK.
OKAY?
THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE I GAVE
IT EXECUTIVE RUN THROUGH LIKE
THIS AND I WENT AROUND THE YOUR
CONCERN LIKE THAT AMEND SO I'M
THE LEADER NOW.
>> Stephen: TUNE IN TOMORROW
WHEN I GENEROUSLY OFFER TO
CO-OPT THE OCCUPY MOVEMENT.
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS TIT FOR
TAT.
