WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT?
OH, YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR IT
SCREAMING.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, ROP THE VOKE.
FOLKS, THIS SUMMER WAS A
SCORCHER AND THE NATIONAL SNOW
AND ICE DATA CENTER RECENTLY
WARMED THAT ARCTIC SEA ICE IS AT
A RECORD LOW SHRINKING FROM THIS
IN 1984 TO THIS TODAY.
BUT CUT THE ICE SOME SLACK, OF
COURSE IT SHRANK!
THAT WATER'S FREEZING!
(LAUGHTER)
AND NOW THAT THE ICE HAS MELTED,
IT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING:
SUBZERO PLEASURE YACHTING.
LAST MONTH, IN THE MUNICIPAL VUT
TERRITORY, CANADIAN POLICE FINED
AN AUSTRALIAN TYCOON FOR AN
ARCTIC PARTY CRUISE ABOARD HIS
LUXURY YACHT "FORTRUS" WHERE HE
AND HIS FRIEND GOT DRUNK, SET
OFF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS, JETSKIED
AND HARASSED LOCAL MUSK-OX.
(LAUGHTER)
DID YOU KNOW THE ESKIMOS NOW
HAVE 25 DIFFERENT WORDS FOR
"DOUCHEBAG"?
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, IN ADDITION --
(APPLAUSE)
DOUCHEBAG.
DOUCHEBAG FANS HERE TONIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING
NOUVEAU PLACES TO BE RICHE, AS
THE ARCTIC ICE MELTS IT'S ALSO
EXPOSING OIL, DIAMONDS, SHIPPING
ROUTES, AND THE NEW HISTORY
CHANNEL SERIES "ICE ROAD
DROWNERS."
(LAUGHTER)
SO THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR
ANOTHER EDITION OF "SMOKING
POLES."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE QUEST FOR ARCTIC RICHES.
FOLKS, AMERICA HAS MANY RIVALS
IN THE BATTLE FOR ARCTIC BOOTY:
RUSSIA, DENMARK, AND NOW CHINA
WHICH IS LOBBYING INTENSELY FOR
PERMANENT OBSERVER STATUS ON THE
ARCTIC COUNCIL AS A NEAR-ARCTIC
STATE.
BECAUSE MUCH LIKE THE PEOPLE IN
THE ARCTIC, THE CHINESE CAN'T
SEE FOR THE "SUN" FOR SIX MONTHS
A YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS, CHINA COVETS GREENLAND'S
RESOURCE RICH BOUNTIES.
>> UNDER THIS ICE SHEET LIES
VAST DEPOSITS OF VALUABLE
MINERALS.
HERE IN SOUTH GREENLAND,
GEOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND SOME OF
THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEPOSITS OF
RARE EARTH METALS.
THESE ARE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS IN
THE MANUFACTURE OF HIGH TECH
ITEMS.
>> Stephen: CHINA NEEDS THESE
RARE EARTH METALS TO MAKE CELL
PHONES, MILITARY GUIDANCE
SYSTEMS AND TOOTHPASTE.
(LAUGHTER)
LUCKILY GREENLAND'S VICE PREMIER
JENS B. FREDERIKSEN SEES THROUGH
CHINA'S SUDDEN INTEREST IN THEIR
COUNTRY SAYING "WE ARE AWARE
THAT IS BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE
SOMETHING TO OFFER, NOT BECAUSE
THEY SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT
INUIT ARE NICE PEOPLE."
(LAUGHTER)
BRAVO, JENS, FOR NOT FALLING FOR
CHINA'S MOO GOO GAI PANDERING.
CHINA DOESN'T APPRECIATE YOUR
PROTO-INUIT THULE CULTURE THE
WAY AMERICA TRULY DOES.
THEY DON'T KNOW AN UMIAK FROM AN
ALEUT IQYAK.
BUT AMERICA WILL RESPECT YOU FOR
YOUR PEOPLES.
FOR YOUR CULTURE AND OF COURSE
FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LANTHANUM FOR
WHICH WE WILL HOLLOW OUT YOUR
COUNTRY LIKE A RIPE CANTALOUPE.
(LAUGHTER)
NEXT UP, BACK IN 2007, VLADIMIR
PUTIN SENT A ROBOT SUBMERSIBLE
TO PLANT THE RUSSIAN FLAG ON THE
SEA FLOOR.
IT WAS THE SAFEST WAY TO CLAIM
THE NORTH POLE, BECAUSE WE ALL
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LICK
IT.
(SCREAMING)
(LAUGHTER)
TRUE STORY.
BUT NOW THE RUSSIANS HAVE GONE
TOO FAR, SENDING A RUSSIAN
ORTHODOX BISHOP WHO LOWERED A
HOLY MEMORIAL CAPSULE INTO THE
SEA, CONSECRATING THE NORTH POLE
TO THE RUSSIANS.
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH WHEN THEY WERE
GODLESS COMMIES, FOLKS.
BUT NOW THEY'RE GODLY COMMIES.
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY, RUSKIES, EVERYBODY KNOWS
GOD GAVE NORTH POLE TO AMERICA
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE SANTA
LIVES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND HE IS A SALARIED EMPLOYEE OF
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY!
(LAUGHTER)
READ YOUR CONTRACT, CRINKLE.
WE NEED THOSE COKE-DRINKING
POLAR BEARS TO DISAPPEAR AND WE
CAN DO THE SAME THING TO YOU,
CHRIS.
FOLKS, WE MUST FIGHT THIS
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS
NATIONALISM WITH OUR OWN
AMERICAN ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS
NATIONALISM.
I SAY WE SLAP A FUR HAT ON PAT
ROBERTSON AND PUSH HIM OUT ON AN
ICE FLOE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE CAN CONSECRATE THE ARCTIC
CIRCLE FOR AMERICA!
AND MAYBE FINALLY GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF WHAT'S CAUSING ALL
THAT ICE TO MELT.
I'M GUESSING IT'S SOMETHING
REALLY HOT THAT THE GAY
