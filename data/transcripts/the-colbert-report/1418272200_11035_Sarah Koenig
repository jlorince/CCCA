FOR BEING HERE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, YOU ARE THEWORLD'S FIRST SUPERSTAR
PODCASTER.
LET'S GET INTO HOW THIS CAMEABOUT.
YOU'RE A PEABODY AWARD-WINNINGJOURNALIST.

SPENT PAST 10 YEARS AS PRODUCERAT "THIS AMERICAN LIFE."
NOW YOU'RE HOSTING THE FIRSTSPIN-OFF PODCAST "SERIAL," AND
THE PENULTIMATE EPISODE ISAVAILABLE TOMORROW, THURSDAY,

THAT MEANS WE'RE WE'RECOMPETING WITH EACH OTHER.
>> I KNOW. I'M AWARE
>> Stephen: YOU'RE AWARE OFTHAT?
>> YEAH.>> Stephen: OK IT'S GO TIME.
HOW DOES IT FEEL AS AJOURNALIST, DID YOU ALWAYS WANT
TO DO TRUE CRIME REPORTING THATPEOPLE LISTEN TO ON A TREADMILL?
( LAUGHTER ).
( CHEERS )( APPLAUSE )
WHAT FIRST INSPIRED YOU TO DO ASPIN-OFF PODCAST?
WHAT FIRST DREW YOU TO DOINGTHIS MEDIUM, FIRST OF ALL?
>> I THINK-- YOU KNOW, I'D BEENWORKING AT THE RADIO SHOW FOR A
LONG TIME AND A FELLOW PRODUCER,JULIE SNYDER, AND I SORT OF WERE
THINKING WHAT ELSE DO WE WANT TODO?
WE COULD TRY THIS LITTLE THINGAND I COULD BE IN MY BASEMENT
WITH A MICROPHONE -->> Stephen: BUT WHY MURDER.
YOU'RE COMING FROM "THISAMERICAN LIFE."
IT SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST SPIN-OFFPODCAST WOULD BE SIBLINGS WHO
THOUGHT THEIR BROTHERS ANDSISTERS WERE IMAGINARY FRIENDS.
OR 24 HOURS IN A CHIROPRACTICWAITING ROOM.
WHY MURDER?
>> IT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY THATWE WANTED TO DO A SHOW ABOUT
MURDER.
WE WANTED TO BE A SERIALIZEDDOCUMENTARY.
AND THIS HAPPENED TO BE A STORYTHAT I WAS ALREADY INTERESTED
IN, THAT I WAS ALREADY-- HADJUST STARTED WORKING ON WHEN WE
GOT THE IDEA TO DO "SERIAL"."
I SAID I'VE GOT A STORY.
LET'S DO THIS ONE.
IT SEEMED TO HAVE A LOT GOING ONAND SEEMED ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN IT
OVER TIME.
>> Stephen: "SERIAL" GOT FIVEMILLION iTUNES DOWNLOADS,
FASTER THAN ANY OTHER PODCAST INHISTORY.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE THEMOST POPULAR PODCAST IN HISTORY?
DO YOU GET PAID IN iTUNES GIFTCARDS.
I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW THE MONEYHERE.
WHAT BENEFITS YOU DOING THIS?
>> WELL, I'M HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).>> Stephen:  THAT'S ALL YOU
NEEDED TO SAY. YOU'RE MYFAVORITE GUEST OF ALL TIME NOW.
THANK YOU.
>>  YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET'STALK ABOUT THE THE ACTUAL CASE
ITSELF.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT TAKES PLACE INBALTIMORE, THE SAME FICTIONAL
CITY FROM "THE WIRE."
WITHOUT GIVING REQUEST SPOILERSAWAY, CAN YOU GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVEN'T HEARD SERIAL ALITTLE NUTSHELL OF WHAT THE
CASE IS.
>> IT'S THE MURDER OF AN18-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
SHE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR ATA HIGH SCHOOL IN BALTIMORE
COUNTY AND SHE WENT MISSING ONEDAY AFTER SCHOOL, AND NOBODY
KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER,AND THEN HER BODY TURNED UP
ABOUT A MONTH LATER IN A CITYPARK.
SHE HAD BEEN BURIED.
AND A FEW WEEKS LATER, HEREX-BOYFRIEND, A 17-YEAR-OLD KID,
A FELLOW SENIOR AT THE HIGHSCHOOL, ADNAN SYED, WAS
ARRESTED. AND -->> Stephen:  WHY REOPEN THIS
CASE?
YOU GUYS WEEK TO WEEK GO INTO ADIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE CASE,
WHY GO BACK INTO HIS STORY?
THIS HAPPENED IN 1999.
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT A GUYNAMED ADNAD SYAD COULD GET A
FAIRER TRIAL AFTER 9/11?
IS THERE A GOAL?
ARE YOU AN ADVOCATE JOURNALIST?
ARE YOU TRYING TO ADVOCATE FORTHIS GUY?
>> I AM NOT ADVOCATING FOR THISGUY.
WHAT GRABBED ME ABOUT THIS STORYIS A FRIEND OF HIS FAMILY CAME
TO ME AND SAID, I BELIEVE THISGUY IS INNOCENT.
THE TRIAL WAS CRAZY.
THE INVESTIGATION HAS HOLES INIT.
I BELIEVE THIS GUY'S INNOCENT.
CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK?
SO I STARTED LOOKING INTO IT,AND I JUST BECAME SO CONFUSED
SO QUICKLY.
SO I JUST KEPT GOING FROM THERE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THETHINGS THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT
THIS IS THAT FROM WEEK TO WEEKYOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR OPINION
ABOUT WHO YOU THINK DID THIS ORWHAT THE TRUTH MIGHT BE OF THE
SITUATION.
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SHOW FORNINE YEARS, AND I HAVE NEVER
ONCE CHANGED MY OPINION ABOUTANYTHING, OKAY?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S COMMITMENT.
THAT'S COMMITMENT TO MY IDEALS,OKAY?
>> I KNOW.
IT'S TRUE.
WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE A STORY FORA YEAR AND A HALF, IT'S TRUE.
I LACK COMMITMENT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen: BUT WITHOUT GIVINGANY SPOILERS AWAY, CAN YOU JUST
TELL ME IF BY THE END OF THESERIES, THAT GIRL EVER LEARNS TO
PRONOUNCE "MALE CHIMP?">> YOU KNOW, WE STILL-- WE STILL
HAVE A WEEK TO GO.
I AM STILL REPORTING.
I AM STILL REPORTING AND THINGSCOULD CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND
THEN SO NEXT WEEK IS WHEN YOU'LLKNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
>> Stephen: I CAN'T WAIT TOFIND OUT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
