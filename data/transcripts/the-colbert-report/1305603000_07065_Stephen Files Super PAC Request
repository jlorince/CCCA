>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK
I BROKE THE TITANIC NEWS
THAT BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND
AND-- LET'S SEE, AH, I WANT
TO SAY HOYT AXTON-- MIKE
HUCKABEE, WHOOO, BOTH OF
THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE DROPPED
OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH
THEIR TV SHOWS.
OF COURSE WHOEVER IS THE
EVENTUAL REPUBLICAN NOMINEE
IS GOING TO NEED A LOT OF
MONEY.
BECAUSE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT
BARACK OBAMA WILL RAISE OVER
$1 BILLION FOR HIS CAMPAIGN.
THAT MEANS BETWEEN NOW AND
ELECTION DAY, HE HAS TO
COLLECT $21 A SECOND.
WHICH IS WHY HIS CAMPAIGN
SLOGAN HAS GONE FROM CHANGE
TO BENJAMIN.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO CLEARLY
FUND-RAISING, FUND RAISING
IS GOING TO BE KEY.
AND FRIDAY THERE WAS
GAME-CHANGING NEWS IN THE
WORLD OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE.
JIM?
>> STEPHEN COLBERT WENT TO
WASHINGTON TODAY AND IS
FILING A REQUEST TO CREATE
HIS OWN SUPERPAC CAN.
HIS PARENT COMPANY VIACOM
DOESN'T WANT HIM GETTING
THEM INTO TROUBLE WITH THE
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
WHILE HE'S DOING THIS AND SO
NOW COLBERT IS MAKING A BIG
PRODUCTION OF GOING TO THE
FEC TO FILE A REQUEST FOR A
MEDIA EXEMPTION.
>> Stephen: OOPS.
THAT IS SO EMBARRASSING.
I AM THE BIG NEWS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELL, AGAIN,
EVIDENTLY, EVIDENTLY ON
FRIDAY I WENT TO THE FEDERAL
ELECTION COMMISSION IN
WASHINGTON TO DROP OFF MY
LEGAL REQUEST TO FORM A
SUPERPAC IT ALL WENT
SMOOTHLY EXCEPT-- FOR WHEN
WITH THE GUARDS WANDED MY
GROIN.
HEY, I WILL REMOVE MY WATCH
AND MY BELT BUT I WILL NOT
REMOVE MY BALLS.
THE WHOLE CITY, THE WHOLE
CITY SHOWED UP TO GREET ME,
IF THE WHOLE CITY OF
WASHINGTON IS 500 WHITE
PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND I ADDRESSED
THOSE GOOD PEOPLE ON THE
STEPS OF THE FEC WHICH
HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT ACROSS
FROM THE FBI, SO TO EVERYONE
WHO SHOWED UP,
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE ON
THE NO-FLY LIST.
JIM, LET'S SHOW THESE PEOPLE
THE MAGIC OF THAT MOMENT.
>> AS WE STAND HERE ON THIS
HISTORIC SITE, WHERE 250
YEARS AGO TODAY GEORGE
WASHINGTON FILED HIS PAPERS
TO FORM HIS INDEPENDENT
EXPENDITURES, NONCONNECTED
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WE ARE ALSO
STANDING AT AN AMERICAN
CROSSROADS.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH
AMERICAN CROSSROADS WHICH IS
THE NAME OF KARL ROVE'S
SUPERPAC.
NOW THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE
LONG TIME SUPPORTERS OF
COLBERT PAC OR COLBERT
SUPERPAC, KNOW OUR MOTTO,
SAY IT WITH ME.
MAKING A BETTER TOMORROW
TOMORROW.
SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE CYNICS OUT
THERE ARE GOING TO SAY
TOMORROW NEVER COMES.
WELL, THANKS TO MY LAWYER
TREVOR POTTER, TODAY,
TOMORROW JUST GOT ONE DAY
CLOSER.
OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME WHO
DON'T WANT TO YOU HAVE A
VOICE.
THERE ARE SOME WHO DON'T
WANT YOU TO HAVE COLBERT
SUPERPAC BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT
I'M NOT WILLING TO RIDE IN
THE BACK OF THE BUS.
WITH ALL THIS SUPERPAC MONEY
I WILL BE RIDING IN A
PRIVATE JET.
WHO WANTS TO RIDE IN THAT
JET WITH ME?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YEAH!
OBVIOUS-- OBVIOUSLY I MEAN
METAPHORICALLY BECAUSE EVEN
A G-5 ONLY HOLDS LIKE FIVE
PEOPLE SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.
ABOUT A YOUNG MAN NAMED BEN
DONALDSONTON THAT I MET IN
IOWA IN A DINER.
BEN'S UNEMPLOYED.
AND HE CAME TO ME WITH A
LIST OF CONCERNS.
HANDWRITTEN.
ON THE BACK OF A GREASE
STAINED PAPER BAG.
THESE WERE THE ISSUES THAT
MATTER TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY
AND HE GAVE ME THAT LIST.
AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT
THEY WERE, I'M SURE JOBS WAS
ON THERE SOMEPLACE.
BUT I DO REMEMBER THIS.
BEN GAVE ME $10.
AND I MADE A PROMISE TO BEN
THAT I WOULD FIND A WAY TO
SPEND THAT MONEY.
WILL YOU HELP ME KEEP THAT
PROMISE TO ALL THE OTHER
BENS OUT THERE?
>> YES!
>> THANK YOU.
THIS IS FOR YOU, BEN!
I WILL NOW SHAKE YOUR HAND
FOR $1 A PIECE.
NO EYE CONTACT.
NO KISSING CAN ON THE LIPS.
NO LAST NAMES.
LET'S KEEP THIS
PROFESSIONAL.
THANK YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, THANK YOU.
>> I WANT TO GET THAT MONEY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HOLD UP YOUR MONEY.
HOLD UP YOUR MONEY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.
AND GOD BLESS-- CITIZENS
UNITED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LOOK AT THAT!
LOOK AT THAT.
I AM LITERALLY PUTTING YOUR
MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS.
I RAKED IN A TOTAL OF $31!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I ALSO GRABBED
SOME PRETTY SWEET WATCHES
WHICH I ASSUME WERE ALSO A
GIFT.
WHAT?
SOME LADY GAVE ME THIS.
OH.
I ASSUMED SHE WAS A GIFT.
THERE YOU GO.
OH.
SO SO HOW ABOUT IT, NATION.
ARE YOU READY FOR COLBERT
SUPERPAC?
ARE YOU PREPARED TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND MOST
IMPORTANTLY, ARE YOU
PREPARED TO WAIT 60 DAYS?
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG THE
FEC LEGALLY HAS TO RESPOND
TO MY REQUEST FOR AN
ADVISORY OPINION ON THE
LEGALITY OF USING MY TV SHOW
TO PROMOTE MY NONCONNECTED
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE
CAN.
JIMMY, BALLOON DROP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WE'RE JUST DOING
ONE AT A TIME.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM LAST
FOR 60 DAYS.
