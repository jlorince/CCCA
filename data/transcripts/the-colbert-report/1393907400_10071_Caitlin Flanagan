YOU GOT A NEW ARTICLE IN THEATLANTIC CALLED THE
FRATERNITY PROBLEM.
IT'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK.
THE DARK POWER OF FRATERNITIES.
WHAT IS THE DARK POWER OFFRATERNITIES?
I KNOW ABOUT THE BRIGHTSTRENGTH OF FRATERNITIES.
THAT ALLOWS MEN TO BOND WITHEACH OTHER.
>> WELL, IT'S PART OF THATGREAT STRENGTH THAT LEADS TO
THE DARK SIDE.
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO POWERFULIN COLLEGE ADMINISTRATIONS
THEY'RE ABLE TO GET AWAYWITH LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE
ULTIMATELY VERY DANGEROUS TOOUR YOUNG MEN AND I THOUGHT
I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT INTHIS ARTICLE.
>> Stephen: WHAT COULD BEDANGEROUS.
I WAS AN SAE AT DARTMOUTH.
AND ALL WE DID WAS GOODWORKS LIKE THE OCCASIONAL
FOOD DRIVE AND THEN-- ANDTHEN, YOU KNOW, DURING
PLEDGE WEEK WE PASSED AGREASE 45 RECORD FROM ASS
CHEEK TO ASS CHEEK IN THEBASEMENT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S JUSTBONDING.
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMANAND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
WAY MEN-- I'M JUST SAYING,NO, NO.
I MEAN SORORITIES ARE GOODTOO.
WERE YOU IN A SORORITY.
>> I WAS ACTUALLY A FOUNDINGMEMBER OF A SORORITY SO I'M
NOT ENTIRELY OPPOSED TO THEGREEK LIFE.
>> Stephen: NO YOU'RE PARTOF THE PROBLEM, EVIDENTLY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TOBECOME A BUSINESS OF A
SOLUTION SO I THOUGHT IT WASTIME TO SHINE A BIT OF A
BRIGHT LIGHT INTO THENEGATIVE SIDES OF FRATERNITY
LIFE.
>> Stephen: I HAVE MYRESEARCHERS LOOK INTO THIS,
85% OF ALL SUPREME COURTJUSTICES SINCE 1910 HAVE
BEEN FRAT MEMBERS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: 85% OF FORTUNE500 EXECUTIVES ARE FRAT
MEMBERS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO IT MUST BEGOOD GUYS.
BECAUSE-- (LAUGHTER)
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT THEYSAY, NICE GUYS BECOME THE
HEADS OF FORTUNE 500COMPANIES.
>> YES, WELL THERE ARE MENWHO ARE EXTREMELY ADMIRABLE
WHO BELONGED TO FRATERNITIES WHO HAVE A GREAT HISTORY OF
LEADERSHIP AND PROMOTINGBUSINESS AND POLITICS AND
THE LAW, BUT THERE ARECERTAIN SORT OF TRADITIONS
WITHIN FRATERNITIES THAT AREALIGNED WITH A BAD INSTINCT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BUM ME OUT,BUM ME OUT.
COME ON.
>> OKAY THERE IS A VIOLENTHAZING WHICH HAS REALLY
SCARRED AND INJURED MANYYOUNG MEN OVER THE COURSE OF
MANY DECADES.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'S DONEWITH LOVE, OKAY.
THOSE ARE MY BROS.
>> RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.
>> Stephen: MY BROS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE FRATERNITIESWHO WOULD I CALL BROSEF OR
BROHAM.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
I'M SORRY.
>> Stephen: WHAT AM I DOING.
DO YOU WANT A BEER?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> THANK YOU, YES.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERYMUCH, IT'S ALL FOAM, I'M
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
UH-HUH.
>> SEE YOU COULD DO A KEGSTAND NOW AND SHOW THAT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: OR, OR YOU
COULD.
>> WELL-- I WAS IN ASORORITY AFTER ALL BUT MY
SON IS HERE TONIGHT SO IWON'T GO THAT FAR.
>> Stephen: OKAY.

>> IT'S HORRIBLE.
>> Stephen: DOES THAT TAKEBACK.
>> NEVER A BEER DRINKER.
BUT ANYTHING FOR THE SHOW.
>> Stephen: DID YOU-- WHEREDID YOU GO TO COLLEGE.
>> UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.
>> Stephen: UVA, THAT HASA SERIOUS FRAT SYSTEM THERE
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THEPHI CAP HOUSE.
>> OKAY, UPSTAIRS.
>> Stephen: SURE, UPSTAIRS,DOWNSTAIRS, EVERYWHERE IN
THAT HOUSE, RIGHT THERE ONTHAT RUGBY FIELD.
>> THE QUAD.
DID YOU EVER SPEND ANY TIMEDOWN THERE.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'SINTERESTING WHEN I WAS AN
UNDERGRADUATE I WASEXPLICITLY TOLD EVEN BY THE
ADMINISTRATION AT UVA TONEVER GO UPSTAIRS IN A
FRATERNITY HOUSE UNLESS IHAD SOBER COMPANIONS WITH ME
BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCHRAPE IN THE FRATERNITY
HOUSES AND THAT IS SOMETHINGTHAT HASN'T CHANGED OVER THE
YEARS THERE IS STILL SEXUALASSAULT.
NOT ALL FRATERNITIES.
>> Stephen: I KNOW, NOW YOU ARE PLAYING THE SEXUAL
ASSAULT CARD.
>> AND NOW I LOSE.
I THINKYOU'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: SO I MEAN HOW
WIDESPREAD IS THE DARK POWEROF FRATS?
IS THERE A REDEEMING FACTORTO THEM?
>> WELL, THERE CERTAINLY IS.
IF YOU ARE IN A GOOD FRATERNITY THERE IS TREMENDOUS
LEADERSHIP TRAINING,MENTORING, THEY DO
MILLIONS OF HOURS OFCOMMUNITY SERVICE.
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FORWORTHY CAUSES SO WHEN
FRATERNITIES ARE DONE IN AGOOD WAY, IF THEIR ALCOHOL
PROBLEM IS NOT BAD, THEY'REWONDERFUL ORGANIZATIONS.
BUT THEY CAN BE EXTREMELYDANGEROUS AND EVEN
DEVASTATING TO THE YOUNGPEOPLE WHO PARTY THERE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINKANYTHING WILL BE DONE TO
TONE DOWN THE PARTY CULTUREOF FRATS?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THAT'SWHAT PEOPLE JOIN FRATS FOR,
ISN'T IT?
