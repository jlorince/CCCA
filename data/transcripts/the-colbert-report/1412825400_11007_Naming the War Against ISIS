>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I GOTTA GET OFF MY CHESTHERE AND I HOPE THIS DOESN'T
COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANY OF YOUPEOPLE.
BARACK OBAMA IS A COMPLETEFAILURE.
IF HE IS SO COMMITTED TOFIGHTING TERROR WHY AM I NOW
SEEING POP-UP STORIES FILLEDWITH THINGS THAT SCARE ME.
WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONALSECURITY, WHEN IT COMES TO
NATIONAL SECURITY, THIS GUY'SWORSE THAN JIMMY CARTER.
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
JUST ASK JIMMY CARTER.
>> EVEN JIMMY CARTER ON THEATTACK TELLING A TEXAS NEWSPAPER
THE PRESIDENT WAITED TOO LONG TODEAL WITH ISIS.
>> HE SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVESOMEBODY ON THE GROUND TO DIRECT
OUR MISSILES, AND TO BE SURE YOUHAVE THE RIGHT TARGETS.
THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODYTO MOVE IN AND BE WILLING TO
FIGHT ISIS AFTER THE STRIKE.
>> THAT'S PRESIDENT CARTER.
HOLY SMOKES.
>> IT IS JAW-DROPPING.
THERE IS SIMPLY NO OTHER WAY TOPUT IT.
>> STEPHEN: I HAVE ANOTHER WAYTO PUT IT-- JIMMY CARTER JUST
KICKED OBAMA FROM THE PEANUTPOUCH.
OH, SNAP, OBAMA. YOU JUST GOTMALAISED!
BEING CALLED A WUSS BY JIMMYCARTER?
THAT'S LIKE F.D.R. BEATING YOUAT KICK BALL.
AND NOWHERE, NOWHERE, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, NOWHERE HAS OBAMA
BEEN WEAKER THAN IN THE REALM OFSTRATEGIC NOMENCLATURE.
>> PAST PRESIDENTS WHEN THEY'REAT WAR GIVE THE WAR A NAME.
THEY CALL IS OPERATION DESERTSHIELD, OPERATION DESERT STORM.
>> HE HASN'T NAMED THE WAR YET.
TO ME THAT'S ASTOUNDING.
>> WE HAVEN'T NAMED THE WAR YET,THE NON-WAR WAR.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT,OBAMA HAS REFUSED TO NAME THIS
OPERATION EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEBEEN LAUNCHING AIRSTRIKES FOR
TWO MONTHS. IN HIS HEY DAY, P.DIDDY COULD COME UP WITH FOUR
NEW NAMES IN THAT TIME. I'MSORRY, I'M BEING TOLD THAT HE IS
NOW DUFF PADDY. AND EVERYBODYKNOWS
WHY OBAMA REFUSES TO PICK ANOM-DE-BOOM.
>> THEIR MISSION REMAINSNAMELESS.
IS IT BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSEDOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT AMERICA
IS, INDEED, AT WAR.
>> PRESIDENT HAS NOT GIVEN NAMESTO THE SYRIA OR IRAQ OPERATIONS
AND THAT'S UNUSUAL AND MAYREFLECT THE PRESIDENT'S OWN
AMBIVALENCE OVER A WAR HE DOESNOT WANT FIGHT.
>> UNNAMED QUOTE FROM THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL, ACCORDING TO
A SOURCE, "IF YOU NAME IT YOUOWN IT."
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO OWN IT.WHO'S "THEY?"
>> YES WHO'S THE THEY WHO WON'TOWN THE WHAT ACCORDING TO
WHOEVER AT THE "WALL STREETJOURNAL" WON'T NAME.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, ANSWER ME,OBAMA.
BECAUSE BILL HEMMER IS NOTCONVEYING INFORMATION OF ANY
KIND.
AND A REAL LEADER-- A REALLEADER WOULD STEP UP AND GIVE
THIS MISSION A TITLE THAT WOULDRALLY THE PUBLIC, LIKE WHEN
COLIN POWELL NAMED THE 1989INVASION OF PANAMA, OPERATION
JUST CAUSE.
NOT-- NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITHHIS TITLE FOR THE 2003 INVASION
OF IRAQ, OPERATION JUST CUZ.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THEN THE FIRST MILITARY
INTERVENTION IN 25 YEARS WITHOUTA CODE NAME.
NOW, IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OUR"CHIN-STROKER-IN-CHIEF" WANTS TO
AVOID AN EMBARRASSING ACRONYMHERE, LIKE PAST REJECTED CODE
NAMES, OPERATION AFGHANISTANFREEDOM, WHICH SPELLED OAF, BY
ACCIDENT.
OR OPERATION IRAQ LIBERATION,WHICH SPELLED OIL.
( APPLAUSE )BUT SO FAR, THE ONLY ACTUAL NAME
MILITARY PLANNERS HAVE SUGGESTEDTO THE PENTAGON WAS OPERATION
INHERENT RESOLVE.
WHICH WAS REJECTED BECAUSE, ASONE MILITARY OFFICER PUT IT, IT
WAS JUST KIND OF BLEH.
( APPLAUSE )I AGREE.
I AGREE.
ALTHOUGH, GIVEN THE MOOD OF THECOUNTRY RIGHT NOW, I MIGHT GO
WITH OPERATION KIND OF BLEH.
I MEAN, HOW HARD CAN THIS BE?
JUST LOOK AT THE GREAT NAMESWE'VE COME UP WITH IN THE PAST.
OPERATION SHARP EDGE, OROPERATION VIGILANT RESOLVE.
EITHER ONE OF WHICH COULD BE AGREAT SLOGAN FOR VIAGRA.
SO IF BARACK OBAMA WON'T STEP UPAND NAME THIS MISSION, I WILL.
I HOPE THAT HISTORY WILLREMEMBER STEPHEN COLBERT AS THE
MAN WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO NAMETHE WAR HE WAS NOT WILLING TO
FIGHT IN.
SO LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE NAMECHAMBER 5,000.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WELCOME.
WELCOME TO THE NAME CHAMBER.
WELCOME TO THE NAME CHAMBER5,000, A NAME WE GOT OUT OF THE
NAME CHAMBER 4,000.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
OKAY I HAVE TWO TYPES OF SLIPSOF PAPER IN THERE.
THE RED SLIPS HAVE DESCRIPTIVEWORDS LIKE "JUST," "SWIFT" OR
"PAISLEY."
THE BLUE SLIPS HAVE POWERFULNOUNS LIKE "EAGLE," OR "LIBERTY"
OR "EMMA," WHICH IS THE MOSTPOPULAR GIRL'S NAME OF 2014.
I'M GOING TO GET IN THERE, GRABONE OF EACH AND FINALLY SETTLE
THE DEBATE OVER THE NAME OF THEWAR WE HAVE NEVER DEBATED.
JIMMY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> BLOW ME!
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, BARACK OBAMA.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
BARACK OBAMA, I KNOW YOU'REWATCHING.
FROM NOW ON, WE'RE FIGHTINGOPERATION SWOLLEN PANTHER
FROM NOW ON, WE'RE FIGHTINGOPERATION SWOLLEN PANTHER
OR OPERATION TURGID HAMMER.
OR RECKLESS CHAINSAW.
OR WE COULD STRIKE FEAR IN THEHEART OF OUR ENEMIES WITH
OPERATION LUXURIOUS PULL TAB.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THERE.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
>> STEPHEN: YOU'RE WELCOME.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S A BUNCH OFGOOD NAMES, MR. PRESIDENT.
OKAY, SO PLEASE LET'S PUT SOMESACK IN THIS TACK.
THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD ONE,OPERATION SACK ATTACK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
