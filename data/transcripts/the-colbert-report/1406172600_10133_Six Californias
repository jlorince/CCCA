I'M NO FAN OF CALIFORNIA.
FIRST OF ALL THEY'VE GOT AGRIZZLY BEAR ON THEIR FLAG.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CUT TOTHE CHASE, CALIFORNIA AND
MAKE IT CHARLIE MANSON.
AND TWO THINGS, CALIFORNIAIS THE STATE THAT GAVE
AMERICA ITS TWO GREATESTPRESIDENTS RONALD REAGAN AND
SECOND TERM RONALD REAGAN.
BUT THESE DAYS-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THESE DAYS, FOLKS,CALIFORNIA IS AN
UNGOVERNABLE MESS.
>> CALIFORNIA IS AN ENTIRESTATE FILLED WITH CITIES
EITHER CLEARLY FAILING OR ONTHE VERGE OF DISASTER.
>> CALIFORNIA IS GOINGBROKE.
BUSINESSES ARE FLEEING THESTATE IN DROVES.
>> CALIFORNIA'S PRISONSYSTEM IS JUST AN ABSOLUTE
NIGHTMARE.
>> THE EDUCATION SYSTEM INCALIFORNIA IS RANKED 46th IN
AMERICA AND WE'RE NUMBER ONEIN POVERTY.
>> CALIFORNIA ABLAZE, THREEMORE FIRES BREAK OUT IN
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.
>> YOU SEE THAT, EVENGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN IS NOW
BURNING THE STATE DOWN FOR THEINSURANCE MONEY.
BUT FOLKS THERE IS A GREATNEW PLAN.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.
A GREAT NEW PLAN TO MAKECALIFORNIA WHOLE AGAIN BY
BREAKING IT APART.
>> A PETITION TO BREAKCALIFORNIA INTO SIX SEPARATE
STATES HAS ATTRACTED OVER AMILLION SIGNATURES.
>> THE MEASURE TO BREAK ITINTO 6 STATE COULD BE HEADED
TO 2016 BALLOT
>> Stephen: IT'S ABOUT DAMNTIME THEY BREAK UP CALIFORNIA
BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OFWAITING FOR THE SAN ANDREAS
FAULT TO GET AROUND TO IT. IT'SBEEN PROMISING ME SINCE I WAS
A KID. THE DRIVE CALLS ITSELFSIX CALIFORNIAS AND THEY KNOW
WHAT REALLY MAKES CALIFORNIAUNGOVERNABLE.
>> JUST THINK THERE ARE 38MILLION CALIFORNIANS, BUT
ONLY ONE GOVERNOR.
HOW CAN THAT GOVERNOR LOOKOUT FOR ALL 38 MILLION OF
US.
HE IS TRYING.
BUT THE STATE IS TOO BIG ANDCOMPLICATED TO GOVERN.
>> YEAH, IT'S JUST BIG ANDCOMPLICATED.
I MEAN SO BIG, YOU KNOW,YOU-- YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK?
OH MY GOODNESS, BREAKING UPCALIFORNIA MAKES MY NOSE
TICKLE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
SIX CALIFORNIAS IS THEBRAINCHILD OF SILICON VALLEY
BILLIONAIRE AND EVILSTEPFATHER IN A LIFETIME
MOVIE TIM DRAPER.
WHO CAME UP WITH THE PERFECTMETAPHOR.
>> SIX CALIFORNIAS, GIVES USTHE OPPORTUNITY TO REBOOT
AND REFRESH OUR STATEGOVERNMENT.
>> YES, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITYTO REBOOT.
BUT JUST LIKE RESTARTINGWINDOWS IT MIGHT TAKE A
FEW YEARS.
AND JUST CHECK OUT THE GREATNEW STATE'S NAMES.
THERE'S NORTH CALIFORNIA,SOUTH CALIFORNIA, CENTRAL
CALIFORNIA, AND WESTCALIFORNIA HOME OF LOS
ANGELES, WITH ITS VASTCOLONIC CLEANSE AND
CELEBRITY BABY STALKINGINDUSTRIES.
THEN THERE ARE TWO NEWSTATES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE
NAMES.
JEFFERSON, FAMOUS FORPRODUCING 60% OF THE
NATION'S MARIJUANA ANDEATING 60% OF THE NATION'S
LEFTOVER BURRITOES.
I BELIEVE JEFFERSON'S STATEFLAG WOULD BE A MAGIC EYE
POSTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IT'S A BEAR.
>> LAST BUT ACTUALLY FIRSTTHERE'S THE SAN FRANCISCO
AREA STATE, NATURALLY NAMEDSILICON VALLEY.
I SAY YOU CAN'T GO WRONGNAMING STUFF AFTER
TECHNOLOGY, IT'S TIMELESS.
JUST ASK THE RESIDENCE OF CBRADIO AND BETA MAX.
(LAUGHTER)SILICON VALLEY
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THE STATE OF SILICON
VALLEY WOULD BE THE NATION'SRICHEST STATE PER CAPITA AND
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO SHARETHEIR WEALTH WITH CALIFORNIA
OTHER POORER PER CAPITAS, SOI BELIEVE THEIR STATE BIRD
WILL BE THIS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: MEANWHILE THE
NEIGHBORING STATE OFCENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOULD
BECOME THE POOREST STATE INTHE NATION SO, MAYBE INSTEAD
OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA, ABETTER NAME WOULD BE
VERY WEST VIRGINIA.
