FOLKS, AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK,
AND IT'S COMING FROM WHERE YOU
LEAST EXPECT IT, THE
CONSTITUTION.
AND WHICH AMENDMENT IS TRYING TO
KILL US?
AT FIRST I WAS SURE IT WAS THE
SECOND.
THAT'S WHERE THE GUNS ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NO, THIS THREAT IS LURKING
UP IN THE DOUBLE-DIGITS IN THE
MOST SINISTER AMENDMENT OF THEM
ALL.
JIM.
>> A GROWING NUMBER OF
REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING FOR
DUMPING THE 14th AMENDMENT,
REVOKING THE CITIZENSHIP OF
PEOPLE BORN IN THIS COUNTRY IF
ONE OF THEIR PARENTS IS AN
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.
>> THE 14th AMENDMENT,
LINDSEY GRAHAM AMONG OTHERS, IS
PROPOSING THAT WE REPEAL THE
PROVISION WHERE YOU GET
AUTOMATIC CITIZENSHIP IF YOU ARE
BORN IN THE COUNTRY.
>> THE 14th AMENDMENT WAS
WRITTEN AND PASSED I THINK IN
1868 AT A TIME WHEN WE HAD NO
IMMIGRATION LAW.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S A GOOD
THING.
IF THERE WAS IMMIGRATION LAW,
THE INDIANS COULD HAVE HAD US
DEPORTED.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, NOW, FOLKS, SCARY STUFF.
I KNOW.
SCARY STUFF.
NOW, THE 14th AMENDMENT
STATES THAT ALL PERSONS BORN IN
THE UNITED STATES ARE CITIZENS
OF THE UNITED STATES.
AND IMMIGRANTS ARE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL
LOOPHOLE TO STEAL OUR FREEDOM.
>> TO HAVE A CHILD IN AMERICA,
THEY CROSS THE BORDER, THEY GO
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, HAVE A
CHILD AND THAT CHILD IS
AUTOMATICALLY AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.
IT'S CALLED DROP AND LEAVE.
>> Stephen: YES, DROP AND
LEAVE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE SQUEEZE
AND SCRAM, THRUST AND RUSH, DIE
LATE AND REPATRIATE, AND FOR
THOSE WHO RENT A CAR THE LEAVE
THE COUNTRY, SQUIRTS AND HURTS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT'S GOT AN EVEN MORE
SINISTER NAME.
JIM.
>> WELL, THAT DROPPING
SITUATION, CHRIS, IS WHAT WE
REFER TO AS ANCHOR BABY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
ANCHOR BABY.
AND NOT THE GOOD KIND OF ANCHOR
BABY, LIKE THE LOVE CHILD OF
WOLF BLITZER AND GRETA VAN
SUSTEREN.
BLITZER VAN SUSTERWOLF.
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE KIND
OF SINISTER INFANT THAT ALLOWS
ILLEGALS TO STAY IN THE UNITED
STATES.
NOW, LET ME EXPLAIN TO SOME OF
MY VIEWERS WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE
ANCHOR BABIES COME FROM.
YOU SEE, WHEN AN ILLEGAL MAN AND
AN ILLEGAL WOMAN JUST LOVE EACH
OTHER VERY MUCH, THEY SHARE A
SPECIAL HUG IN THE HALLOWED OUT
DASHBOARD OF A MINIVAN AT THE
ARIZONA BORDER CROSSING.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE FOOTAGE OF THE
BORDER BEING BREECHED.
JIM.
>> ARIBA.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE TRYING TO
GET THROUGH THAT WALL ALL RIGHT.
WE NEED A WALL COATED WITH SPERM
SIDAL JELLY, RIBBED FOR YOUR
FREEDOM.
THEN NINE MONTHS LATER THE BABY
IS BORN A U.S. CITIZEN.
AND BY IMMIGRATION LAW, THEY CAN
GET THEIR RELATIVE A GREEN CARD.
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS WAIT
UNTIL THE CHILD TURNS 21, HAVE
IT PETITION THE GOVERNMENT, THEN
RETURN TO MEXICO FOR A MANDATORY
TEN-YEAR WAITING PERIOD AND
THEN, BOOM, THEY COME BACK TO
STEAL ALL OF OUR SOCIAL SERVICES
STARTING WITH SOCIAL SECURITY
BECAUSE BY THEN THEY'RE
ELIGIBLE.
[LAUGHTER]
EASY PEASY TACO SQUEEZY.
THAT WAS A LOT OF WORDS.
THAT WAS A LOT OF WORDS.
I EARNED MY PAYCHECK ON THAT.
THAT WAS A LOT OF WORDS.
THE ONLY OTHER WAY THEY COULD
STAY IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO BE
ONE OF THE 98% OF IMMIGRANTS WHO
ARE NOT DEPORTED EVERY YEAR.
WE HAVE TO STOP.
THIS EPIDEMIC OF UNWANTED
FOREIGNERS ON OUR SOIL.
AND I CANNOT SAY IT ANY BETTER
THAN MITCH McCONNELL WHO LAST
WEEK SAID, WITH ALL THESE
UNWANTED MEXICANS, "AMERICA WILL
BECOME A COLONY OF ALIENS WHO
WILL SHORTLY BE SO NUMEROUS THEY
WILL NEVER ADOPT OUR LANGUAGE OR
CUSTOMS ANY MORE THAN THEY CAN
ACQUIRE OUR COMPLEXION."
OH, YEAH.
SORRY.
THAT WASN'T MITCH McCONNELL
LAST WEEK.
THAT WAS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN IN
1751.
HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT
MEXICANS.
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GERMANS.
AND HE WAS RIGHT, WE DIDN'T STOP
THOSE SWARTHY KRAUTS.
NOW WE'RE ALL WEARING
LEDERHOSEN.
BESIDES, THE 14th AMENDMENT
WAS NEVER MEND TO PROTECT
IMMIGRANTS.
>> WHO IS IT TO PROTECT?
>> SLAVES.
>> SLAVES.
>> THE SLAVES, YES.
SLAVES.
SLAVERY'S A LONG TIME AGO.
>> Stephen: LONG TIME AGO.
THESE DAYS DARK-SKINNED PEOPLE
WITH NO RIGHTS DON'T PICK OUR
CROPS.
WE HAVE MEXICANS FOR THAT.
SO CLEARLY ANCHOR BABIES ARE
DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY, AND
HERE TO MOVE THAT I AM RIGHT BY
DISAGREEING WITH ME IS THE
STERLING PROFESSOR OF LAW AND
POLITICAL SCIENCE AT YALE
UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER ANCHOR
BABY HIMSELF, PLEASE WELCOME
AKEEL AMAR.
PROFESSOR AMAR, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]
FIRST OF ALL, ISN'T IT A LITTLE
CALLOUS OF YOU TO BE HERE WITH A
MUSLIM-SOUNDING NAME THIS CLOSE
TO GROUND ZERO?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S INSENSITIVE, DON'T YOU
THINK?
>> WELL, I GUESS I'M... THERE'S
NOT A LOT I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAN BE DONE
ABOUT THE 14th AMENDMENT?
CAN WE GET RID OF IT?
>> IT'S A PRETTY GREAT
AMENDMENT.
>> Stephen: IN WHAT WAY?
NAME 18 WAYS IT'S GREAT.
[LAUGHTER]
IT PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP
AND BEAR ARMS AGAINST...
>> Stephen: THE SECOND
AMENDMENT DOES THAT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
>> THE ORIGINAL BILL OF RIGHTS
APPLIED ONLY AGAINST THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
IT WAS THE 14th AMENDMENT,
MR. LINCOLN'S AMENDMENT, THAT
SAYS, "NO STATE SHALL MAKE ANY
LAW WHICH SHALL ABRIDGE THE
PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES,"
ONE OF WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO
HAVE A GUN IN YOUR HOME.
THAT'S A PRETTY GREAT AMENDMENT,
RIGHT?
>> Stephen: CAN WE KEEP THE
14th AMENDMENT BUT MAKE A
SPECIAL CLASS OF U.S.
CITIZENSHIP THAT HAS NO RIGHTS?
>> BEEN THERE.
DONE THAT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> JIM CROW.
>> Stephen:, NO THIS ISN'T JIM
CROW BECAUSE THIS ISN'T BLACK
PEOPLE.
IT'S HISPANIC PEOPLE.
IT'S DIFFERENT.
OR CAN'T YOU TELL THE
DIFFERENCE, SIR?
THAT'S KIND OF RACIST.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, HERE'S THE BIG IDEA.
THE BIG IDEA IS THAT WE'RE ALL
BORN CITIZENS IF WE'RE BORN IN
THE UNITED STATES AND THAT WE'RE
BORN EQUAL CITIZENS.
IT'S REALLY THE TEXTUAL
EMBODIMENT OF MR. JEFFERSON'S
IDEA THAT ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL.
>> Stephen: DOES THE MOM HAVE
TO BE HERE, OR CAN SHE JUST BE
OVER THE BORDER AND SQUIRT THE
BABY OVER THE BORDER SO IT LANDS
IN BOUND, IT'S LIKE A TENNIS
SERVE, IT JUST LANDS, TIPS OFF
THE LINE.
IS THAT LEGAL?
I'M SURE THERE ARE WOMEN
POINTING THEMSELVES AT OUR
BORDER RIGHT NOW.
>> IT'S AN AMAZING IMAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> BUT I THINK ACTUALLY THE KEY
IS, LET'S FOCUS ON THE CHILD.
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE CHILD.
>> Stephen: I'M HAPPY TO DO
THAT.
>> A CHILD BORN ON AMERICAN
SOIL.
LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THE PARENTS
SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: THIS IS WHAT
CONFUSES ME ABOUT THESE KIDS.
THEIR PARENTS ARE SHIFTLESS
CRIMINALS WHO BROKE INTO THIS
COUNTRY.
WE GOT TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE,
BUT THAT BABY, BY BEING BORN AN
AMERICAN IS AUTOMATICALLY THE
GREATEST, STRONGEST,
HARDEST-WORKING, MOST
INDUSTRIOUS, MOST PROSPEROUS,
MOST GOD-FEARING PEOPLE IN THE
ENTIRE WORLD.
HOW DID THEY COME OUT OF THESE
CRIMINALS?
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BIG IDEA
OF THE 14th AMENDMENT.
WE'RE ALL BORN EQUAL, WHETHER
WE'RE BORN IN WEDLOCK OR OUT,
WHETHER WE'RE BORN RICH OR POOR
OR BLACK OR WHITE OR MALE OR
FEMALE OR GAY OR STRAIGHT OR JEW
OR GENTILE OR BORN TO PARENTS
WHO ARE CRIMINALS OR NOT.
WE'RE JUDGED ULTIMATELY BY OUR
OWN DEEDS.
>> THE 14th AMENDMENT WAS
WRITTEN TO MAKE SURE SLAVES
BECAME CITIZENS, CORRECT?
>> AND THEIR CHILDREN.
>> OKAY.
SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE SHOULD
MAKE THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
SLAVES?
BECAUSE THAT'S A KNOWN... HEAR
ME OUT, THAT IS A PROVEN PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP, ISN'T IT?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
THINK ABO
