MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BUILD A
ZOO.
THAT'S EASY.
A COUPLE OF DOG, A FAKE MONKEY
TAIL AND A HOT GLUE GUN.
PLEASE WELCOME THOMAS FRENCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY MR. FRENCH.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
YOU, SIR, HAVE FASCINATEING
STORY.
IT IS CALLED ZOO STORY, LIGHTS
IN THE GARDEN OF CAPTIVES.
WHY WOULD YOU WRITE ABOUT A ZOO?
>> I WAS JUST FASCINATED BY WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE ANIMALS INSIDE
THE ZOO IN TAMPA.
>> Stephen: IT SPECIFICALLY
WAS THE TAMPA ZOO?
>> YES, I SPENT SIX YEARS THERE
OFF AND ON.
>> Stephen: DID THEY TREAT YOU
WELL?
>> THEY DID.
THEY WERE VERY GENEROUS AND
REALLY KIND.
>> I'M TRYING THE RECREATE YOUR
HABITAT HERE.
I KNOW YOU WORK AT A NEWSPAPER,
SO I FIRED ALMOST MY ENTIRE
STAFF TODAY.
>> WELL, JOURNALISTS ARE AN
ENDANGERED SPECIES.
>> Stephen: THEY ARE.
IS THERE A BREEDING PROGRAM FOR
THEM?
>> WE'RE TRYING.
>> Stephen: NOW, THIS
PARTICULAR ZOO WAS AN AMBITIOUS
ZOO TO TELL THE FOLKS WHAT THE
ZOO WAS TRYING TO DO WITH
ITSELF.
>> WELL, THEY TRIED THE
BASICALLY MOVE FROM BEING A
MID-SIZED RESPECTED ZOO TO BEING
A BIG-CITY ZOO.
TO DO THAT THE CENTERPIECE WAS
THEY BROUGHT IN WILD EL FACTS
FROM AFRICA.
SO THE BOOK OPENS WITH SCENE
WHERE YOU HAVE 11 WILD ELEPHANTS
IN CRATES WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN
FROM SWAZILAND IN THE SOUTHERN
TIP OF AFRICA AND ARE FLYING
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN ONE 747
TO LIVES IN CAPTIVITY.
>> FIRST CLASS OR COACH?
THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM BACK
THERE.
>> IT WAS ACTUALLY A FRAILGTER
747 AND THEY WERE IN THESE GIANT
CRATES INSIDE THIS HOLD.
THEY HAD A COUPLE HUMAN, A VET
AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO KNEW
THE ELEPHANTS WELL, HAD GROWN UP
WITH THEM IN AFRICA.
>> Stephen: THE ELEPHANTS WERE
ASLEEP?
>> THEY WERE SEDATED.
SOME OF THEM WERE WAKING UP.
>> Stephen: OVER THE ATLANTIC?
>> OVER THE ATLANTIC.
SOME OF THE BULLS AT ONE POINT
BEGAN TO PUSH AGAINST THE SIDE
OF THE CRATE AND TEST THE
STRENGTH OF THE WALL.
A HUMAN HAD A TERRIFYING VISION
OF ONE OF THE BULLS...
>>
>> Stephen: GRABBING A BEER
AND PULLING THE ESCAPE THING AND
GOING DOWN A SLIDE?
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> MUCH WORSE THAN THAT.
HE HAD A VISION OF A BULL
CHARGING THE CENTER OF THE PLANE
AND THEN TUMBLING DOWN WITH THE
PLANE DISABLED BECAUSE THERE'S
NO PILOT.
>> Stephen: COMING RIGHT AT
YOU.
THAT POINTS OUT THE THINGS WE
DON'T THINK ABOUT ZOOS.
I GO TO ZOOS AND I GO, OKAY,
ANIMALS, A LOT GOES INTO GETTING
THE ANIMALS THERE.
THESE GUYS COLLECTED A BUNCH OF
MONKEYS AND TRIED TO CREATE A
MONKEY ISLAND.
WHERE DID THEY GET MONKEY?
>> ORIGINALLY FROM AFRICA.
SO THEY WERE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT
MONKEYS?
>> THEY GOT THEM FROM PUERTO
RICO.
THERE'S A LOT OF BONKIES THERE
AND INSTALLED THEM ON THIS
MONKEY ISLAND AND THEY PROMPTLY
SWAM AWAY.
>> Stephen: THEY DIDN'T THINK
MONKEYS COULD SWIM?
>> THERE WAS SOME DEBATE ABOUT
WHETHER THEY COULD SWIM OR
WHETHER THEY COULDN'T.
WHO WON THAT DEBATE?
THE MONKEYS WON THE DEBATE.
>> Stephen: WELL, I THINK THIS
SHOULD BE CALLED "ESCAPE FROM
MONKEY ISLAND."
"MONKEY MADNESS MAYHEM."
[APPLAUSE]
SO DID... WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
GROW A ZOO?
LIKE WHAT'S... I MEAN, IS IT
STATUS?
IS A GREAT TOWN NEED A GREAT ZOO
BECAUSE CHICAGO'S LINKIN PARK
ZOO, SAN DIEGO'S GOT THEIR ZOO,
NEW YORK WE GOT OUR CENTRAL PARK
AND THE WRONGS ZOO, DOES IT SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT A TOWN THAT YOU
HAVE THE BEST CAPTIVE ANIMALS?
>> YES, BIG CITIES REALLY LONG
FOR BIG-CITY ZOOS, AND TAMPA
WANTED A BIG-CITY ZOO.
IT IS ABOUT EGO.
ACTUALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT A ZOO
IS ABOUT HUMAN EGO BECAUSE THIS
IDEA THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT,
THAT OUR SPECIES HAS THE RIGHT
TO GATHER OTHER SPECIES FROM
AROUND THE WORLD AND HOLD THEM
IN THIS PLACE SAYS A LOT ABOUT
OUR ASSUMPTIONS OF HUMAN
SUPREMACY.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WILL HAVE DOMINION OVER THE
ANIMALS.
READ YOUR GENESIS, SIR.
>> IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE
BEGINNING.
>> Stephen: IT ABSOLUTELY.
IS THE ANIMALS LOVE IT THERE,
RIGHT?
LIFE IN THE GARDEN OF CANTIVES.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE GARDEN OF
EDEN.
IT'S PARADISE.
THEY GET THEIR PELLETS AND THAW.
>> WELL, I TELL YOU, THE KEEPERS
WORK REALLY HARD TO TAKE REALLY
GOOD CARE OF THESE ANIMALS, AND
YOU CAN TELL SOME OF THE ANIMALS
ARE HAPPY THERE.
HAPPINESS IS A HUMAN CONSTRUCT,
BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY CONTENT.
THEY'RE WELL FED AND WELL CARED
FOR.
YOU SEE WHEN YOU GO TO THAT ZOO
AND OTHERS THAT SOME SPECIES
REALLY STRUGGLE WITH CAPTIVITY.
FOR SIX YEARS YOU WERE THERE?
>> OFF AND ON.
>> Stephen: DID IT CHANGE THE
WAY YOU LOOKED AT PEOPLE?
DID YOU START SEEING PEOPLE AS
ANIMALS?
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WATCH ALL THESE SPECIES AND
THEIR BEHAVIOR, AND YOU START TO
SEE PEOPLE'S PRIMAL BEHAVIOR
UNDERNEATH.
THE HEAD OF THE ZOO WHOSE
NICKNAME WAS EL DIABLOS?
BLANCO AMONG THE STAFF.
>> Stephen: THE WHITE DEVIL?
>> THE WHITE DEVIL BECAUSE HE
HAD A REALLY STRONG VISION FOR
WHAT THE ZOO SHOULD BE, AND HE
WAS DETERMINED THE MAKE THAT
VISION COME TRUE, AND NOT
EVERYONE UNDERNEATH HIM THOUGHT
HE WAS THE MOST GENTLE OF
BOSSES.
>> Stephen: WAS HE THE ALPHA
MALE GRILL A?
>> HE WAS THE ALPHA OF THE ZOO.
THEY HAVE WALKIE TALKIES WITH
VARIOUS CODES.
HE WAS NUMBER ONE.
>> Stephen: WAS HE AGGRESSIVE
TOWARDS YOU IN ANY WAY?
>> NOT TOWARDS ME.
>> Stephen: HE NEVER TRIED TO
MOUNT YOU OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: SO THERE IS HAPPY
ENDING.
THOMAS FRENCH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
