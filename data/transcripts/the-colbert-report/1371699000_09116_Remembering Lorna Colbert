>> Stephen: HI, EVERYBODY,
THANKS FOR BEING IN HERE
TONIGHT, NERVE HERE AND OUT
THERE WATCHING.
I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM "THE REPORT"
FOR A WEEK BECAUSE ONE WEEK AGO
TODAY MY MOTHER LORNA COLBERT
DIED AND I WANT TO THANK
EVERYBODY WHO OFFERED THEIR
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.
NOW IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW AND
YOU LIKE THIS SHOW THAT'S
BECAUSE OF EVERYBODY WHO WORKS
HERE AND I'M LUCKY TO BE ONE OF
THEM.
BUT WHEN YOU WATCH THE SHOW, IF
YOU ALSO LIKE ME, THAT'S BECAUSE
OF MY MOM.
SO BEFORE WE START THE SHOW
AGAIN, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER.
SHE WAS BORN JUST A LITTLE WAYS
FROM HERE IN LARCHMONT NEW YORK
ON CHATSWORTH AVENUE IN 1920.
THE SAME WEEK WOMEN FIRST GOT
THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
SHE SPENT HER SUMMERS IN THE
ADIRONDACKS WITH HER OLDER
SISTER COLLEEN AND HER YOUNGER
BROTHER ED WHO CALLED HER
SNODGRASS.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE MET MY FATHER JAMES AT AGE
12 AT COTILLION AND SHE LIKED
HIM BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO
KNOW HOW MUCH SO SHE WOULD MAKE
HER FRIENDS RIDE THEIR BIKES ALL
THE WAY ACROSS TOWN TO PASS BY
HIS HOUSE BUT THEN SHE WOULD
NEVER LOOK TO SEE IF HE WAS IN
THE FRONT YARD.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH, OF COURSE, DROVE HER
FRIEND CRAZY AND EVIDENTLY SHE
ALSO DROVE MY FATHER CRAZY
BECAUSE THEY WERE MARRIED AND
PROMPTLY HAD 11 CHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE MADE A VERY LOVING HOME FOR
US.
NO FIGHT BETWEEN SIBLINGS COULD
END WITHOUT HUGS AND KISSES.
THOUGH HUGS NEVER NEEDED A
REASON IN HER HOUSE.
SINGING AND DANCING WERE
ENCOURAGED-- EXCEPT AT THE
DINNER TABLE.
SHE TRAINED TO BE AN ACTRESS
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER AND SHE
WOULD TEACH US HOW TO DO STAGE
FALLS BY PRETENDING TO FAINT ON
THE KITCHEN FLOOR.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE WAS FUN.
SHE KNEW MORE THAN HER SHARE OF
TRAGEDY, LOSING HER BROTHER AND
HER HUSBAND AND THREE OF HER
SONS.
BUT HER LOVE FOR HER FAMILY AND
HER FAITH IN GOD SOMEHOW GAVE
HER THE STRENGTH NOT ONLY TO GO
ON BUT TO LOVE LIFE WITHOUT
BITTERNESS AND TO INSTILL IN ALL
OF US A GRATITUDE FOR EVERY DAY
WE HAVE TOGETHER.
AND I KNOW IT MAY SOUND GREEDY
TO WANT MORE DAYS WITH A PERSON
WHO LIVED SO LONG, BUT THE FACT
THAT MY MOTHER WAS 92 DOES NOT
DIMINISH IT, IT ONLY MAGNIFY IT
IS ENORMITY OF THE ROOM WHOSE
DOOR HAS NOW QUIETLY SHUT.
IN HER LAST DAYS MY MOTHER
OCCASIONALLY BECAME CONFUSED AND
TO TRY TO GROUND HER WE ASKED
SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE "WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SONG?"
SHE COULDN'T ANSWER THESE.
BUT WHEN ASKED WHAT HER FAVORITE
PRAYER WAS SHE IMIMMEDIATELY
RECITED "A CHILD'S PRAYER" IN
GERMAN THAT SHE USED TO SAY TO
MY ELDEST BROTHERS AND SISTERS
IN BEDTIME WHEN THEY WERE LIVING
IN MUNICH IN THE LATE 14940s.
HER FAVORITE MEMORY OF PRAYER
WAS A YOUNG HER TUCKING IN HER
CHILDREN.
WE WERE THE LIGHT OF HER LIFE
AND SHE LET US KNOW IT UNTIL THE
END.
AND THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
NOW WE CAN GET TO THE TRULY
IMPORTANT WORK OF TELEVISION
BROADCASTING, WHICH IS WHAT SHE
WOULD WANT ME TO DO.
WHEN I WAS LEAVING HER LAST
WEEK, I LEANED OVER AND I SAID
"MOM, I'M GOING BACK TO NEW YORK
TO DO THE SHOW."
AND SHE SAID "I CAN'T WAIT TO
SEE IT.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE
WORLD."
SO WITH THAT IN MIND
