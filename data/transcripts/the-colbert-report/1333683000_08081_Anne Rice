(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
MS. RICE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, MADAME, YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF 31 NOVELS THAT HAVE SOLD OVER A HUNDRED
MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE.
MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.
EVERYBODY OF COURSE KNOWS YOU FROM THE VAMPIRE NOVELS.
THEY ARE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM.
NOW YOU HAVE A NEW NOVEL CALLED THE WOLF GIFT.
NOW I ASSUME FROM THE TITLE THIS IS ABOUT A WOLF WITHOUT LEARNS THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS.
(LAUGHTER) TRUE?
>> NO, NO, ACTUALLY, HE JUST LEARNS HOW TO BE A WEREWOLF,
A MAN LEARNS HOW TO BE A WEREWOLF.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU LEARN HOW TO BE A WEREWOLF, AREN'T YOU BITTEN BY ANOTHER
WEREWOLF TO BECOME A WEREWOLF.
>> THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS YOUNG MAN, RUBIN GOLDING, MY HERO.
HE IS 23, HE IS A REPORTER.
AND HE GETS BITTEN.
>> Stephen: RUBIN GOLDING,
IS HE JEWISH.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, NO, HE ACTUALLY ISN'T JEWISH.
BUT HE MIGHT BE HIS BACKGROUND.
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO THE BACK STORE EVE THE ANCEST REE YET.
I MIGHT DO THAT IN THE SECOND BOOK.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE IF MAN FLESH IS KOSHER.
>> WELL, IT THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE HE DOES DEFINITELY GET CARRIED AWAY.
AND HE DOES EAT MAN FLESH.
>> Stephen: HE DOES EAT PEOPLE.
>> HE DOES.
>> Stephen: NOW THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR ME.
WELL-- I HOPE THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.
HE WANTS TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS HAPPENED AND WHAT HE CAN DO WITH HIS POWER.
AND HE ENDS UP FEELING THAT IT IS A KIND OF A GIFT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HERE'S MY PROBLEM.
(LAUGHTER) I READ ALL YOUR VAMPIRE NOVELS.
I LOVED THEM.
THEY, YOU KNOW, THEY-- I FELT AFTER I READ INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, THE FIRST
ONE, I KIND OF FELT LIKE I,
MY MULTIWAS FULL OF BLOOD.
HONEST TO GOD FROM READING IT.
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I SHOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MY BROTHER.
I DID, I RECOMMENDED IT TO MY BROTHER, I GOT TO LET YOU KNOW, I KIND OF FEEL LIKE
I'M A VAMPIRE NOW.
BUT WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THOSE IS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DAMNED.
IT'S NOT A HAPPY EXPERIENCE FOR THEM.
BUT NOW-- THE SPARKLEY VAMPIRES WE HAVE NOW, IT'S ALL JUST GLAMOUR, GLAMOUR,
LET'S GET MARRIED.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DOW FEEL LIKE THESE NEW VAMPIRE NOVELS PERVERT THE GOOD STORY OF VAMPIRES?
IT'S A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS A DEAL WITH A DEVIL.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> I THINK VAMPIRES ARE A METAPHOR FOR ALL OF US, THE OUTSIDER.
>> Stephen: VAMPIRES ARE OBVIOUS LEIGH A METAPHOR FOR GAY PEOPLE.
>> TRUE.
>> Stephen: BUT WHAT ARE WEREWOLFS, WEREWOLFS ARE HISPANICS.
>> NO (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT MONSTERS-- MONSTERS ARE ALWAYS-- MONSTERS ARE A METAPHOR FOR OURSELVES.
>> YES, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT THEY'RE A METAPHOR FOR US.
WE'RE OUTSIDERS.
WE'RE PREDATORS AT HEART.
>> Stephen: O OH YEAH.
>> AND WE'RE OUTKASTS AND THE WEREWOLF HE IS A GOOD METAPHOR FOR THAT JUST LIKE
THE SRAM PAIR WAS A GOOD METAPHOR FOR THAT.
>> Stephen: CAN WE TALK ABOUT OUTKAST FORCE A SECOND.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: YOU MADAME VER FAMOUSLY REEMBRACED CATHOLICISM.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: ABOUT A COUPLE 10, 15 YEARS BACK, RIGHT.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: AND YOU SAID YOU'RE TO THE GOING TO WRITE ANY MORE VAMPIRE NOVELS YOU
ARE ALL, YOU KNOW, CHRISTIAN AT THIS POINT.
AND HOW LONG DID YOU DO THAT.
>> 12 YEARS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
NOW YOU ARE NO LONGER A CHRISTIAN, CORRECT, NO LONGER A CATHOLIC.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU REALIZE YOU WERE A CATHOLIC LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO HELL, RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF MONSTERS TO WRITE ABOUT FIRSTHAND WHEN
ONE OF THEM IS STABBING YOU IN THE HINEY WITH A RED HOT PITCHFORK.
YOU REALIZE THAT.
RED HOT IRON COFFIN FOR ALL ETERNITY, YOU ARE A HERETIC.
>> MAYBE THAT WILL HAPPEN.
AND MAYBE IT WILL NOT.
>> Stephen: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, OH, REALLY.
>> MAYBE THERE IS NO HELL.
AND MAYBE THERE IS NO DEVIL.
>> Stephen: MAYBE THERE IS NO DEVIL, MAYBE THERE IS NO HELL.
COIN TOSS, OH, HEADS, I WIN.
TAILS, YOU LOSE THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN.
YOUR I MORTAL SOUL, WHY, WHY WOULD YOU RISK THAT, ANNE RICE.
>> I DON'T THINK I'M RISKING IT, MR. COLBERT.
>> Stephen: YOU YOU COULD BE WRONG.
>> I COULD BE, THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT WEIGH A DOUBT AGAINST A CERTAINTY.
>> IT'S NOT A CERTAINTY FOR ME, THAT THINGS EXIST.
IT'S JUST NOT A CERTAINTY AT ALL.
I DON'T-- I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF SYSTEM.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> I CAN'T BELIEF THERE IS A DEFINITE WHILE GOES AROUND THE WORLD TRYING TO GET
PEOPLE TO COMMIT SIN.
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DEVIL.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT HIS DAY IS LIKE.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY-- BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE
PSYCHOLOGY-- HE'S BUSY.
HE'S BEEN VERY BUSY WITH YOU,
I CAN TELL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DEVIL AND HISTORICAL
FIGURE, BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A WEREWOLF AND A VAMPIRE.
>> FICTIONAL FIGURES, YES, I CAN.
I K ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
WHATEVER LETS YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) NOW HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT COMBINING ALL YOUR DIFFERENT NOVELS, VAMPIRES, WEREWOLFS
AND JESUS BECAUSE WHAT ABOUT JESUS WHO IS A WERE SAVIOR AND HE HAS TO FIGHT A VAMPIRE JUDDAS.
>> NO, NO, I WOULD RATHER PASS ON THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PASS ON THAT.
I HAVE DONE TWO NOVELS ABOUT JESUS THAT I PUT MY HEART AND MY SOUL INTO.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I DID AT THE TIME.
>> Stephen: YOU DID AT THE TIME.
>> YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR THAT THING.
>> Stephen: ANNE RICE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
