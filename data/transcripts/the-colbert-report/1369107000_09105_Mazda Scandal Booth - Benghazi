( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: OH, I LOVE A ZOMBIE
ARMY.
HAVE A SEAT.
NATION, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU
WATCH THE NEWS LIKE I DO, IT
SEEMS LIKE LATELY PRESIDENT
OBAMA CANNOT SWING A DEAD CAT
WITHOUT HITTING SOME SORT OF
SCANDAL.
WHICH REMINDS ME, WHAT'S HE
DOING WITH ALL THESE DEAD CATS?
THE CHALLENGE IS, FOLKS, WHICH
ONE TO COVER.
AS ALWAYS, I LOOK TO MY
JOURNALISTIC HEROES: CRONKITE,
MURROW, BARKER.
SO TONIGHT, I AM PROUD TO
INTRODUCE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON
THE COLBERT REPORT THE OBAMA
SCANDAL BOOTH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME.
WELCOME TO THE OBAMA SCANDAL
BOOTH.
BROUGHT TO YOU BY MAZDA AND THE
SCANDALOUSLY SLEEK REDESIGN OF
THE ALL NEW 2014 MAZDA SIX.
MAZDA: IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S
OLDSMOBILE.
BECAUSE IT'S A MAZDA.
NOW INSIDE THIS BOOTH ARE SLIPS
OF PAPER, EACH WITH THE NAME OF
A WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL: I.R.S.,
A.P., BENGHAZI, IMMORTAL
SCORPION SOLDIERS.
OH, IT'S COMING OUT.
AND JUST MOMENTS FROM NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WILL
ENTER THE BOOTH AND, LIKE MY
COLLEAGUES, GRASP WILDLY AT ANY
ACCUSATION THAT FLOATS PAST.
TEN SECONDS...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
JIMMY, TEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK,
PLEASE.
JIMMY.
LET'S GET READY TO SCANDAL.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND TONIGHT'S SCANDAL IS
BENGHAZI.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YES, BENGHAZI.
FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC ATTACKS OF
EIGHT MONTHS AGO, BENGHAZI AND
THE RUMORED COVER-UP HAS BECOME
PROBLEM NUMBER ONE FOR THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
>> SOME REPUBLICANS SAY THE
BENGHAZI SCANDAL WILL CAUSE
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DOWNFALL.
A SURVEY FROM PUBLIC POLICY
POLLING SHOWS 41% OF REPUBLICANS
CONSIDER IT IS TO BE THE BIGGEST
POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
>> Stephen: YES, BENGHAZI IS THE
BIGGEST SCANDAL SINCE SLICED
BREAD WAS CAUGHT FUNNELING MONEY
TO NICARAGUAN DEATH SQUADS.
FOLKS, IF REPUBLICANS ARE ANGRY
NOW, IMAGINE HOW THEY'LL FEEL
WHEN THEY LEARN WHERE BENGHAZI
IS.
>> OF THE REPUBLICANS 39% DON'T
KNOW WHERE BENGHAZI IS.
6% THINK IT'S IN CUBE I CAN'T...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I SAY THIS
JUST PROVES THAT THE SCANDAL IS
GLOBAL FROM BENGHAZI, ARGENTINA,
ALL THE WAY TO BENGHAZI, JAPAN.
THIS COULD EVEN HURT OBAMA IN
HIS HOMETOWN OF BENGHAZI,
ILLINOIS.
NOW, REPUBLICANS HAVE ACCUSED
THE WHITE HOUSE AND STATE
DEPARTMENT OF PARTISAN,
POLITICAL WHITE WASHING OF THE
TALKING POINTS THAT AMBASSADOR
SUSAN RICE USED ON THE SUNDAY
SHOWS AFTER THE ATTACK TO HELP
OBAMA'S RE-ELECTION.
BUT WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY
CARNEY REPEATEDLY DENIED THE
WHITE HOUSE OR STATE DEPARTMENT
MADE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO THE
TALKING POINTS BUT ON MAY 10,
ABC NEWS SUPER SLEUTH JONATHAN
KARL UNCOVERED AN EMAIL FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE'S DEPUTY NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR BEN RHODES AND
JOHN KARL QUOTED, QUOTE, WE MUST
MAKE SURE THAT THE TALKING
POINTS REFLECT ALL AGENCY
EQUITIES INCLUDING THOSE OF THE
STATE DEPARTMENT.
A WHITE HOUSE EMAIL IMPLICATING
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND BOOM
GOES THE SCANDAL-MITE.
YOU SEE WITH THIS EMAIL JAY
CARNEY IS A LIAR AND THESE FOLKS
ARE IN THIS SCANDAL UP TO THEIR
BALL-GHAZIS.
END OF STORY.
EXCEPT THE ACTUAL STORY.
>> WE OBTAINED AN ACTUAL COPY OF
THE BEN RHODES' EMAIL.
AND HE DOESN'T MENTION THE STATE
DEPARTMENT.
HE DOESN'T MENTION TALKING
POINTS.
>> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, SCOTT,
THE WHITE HOUSE ORCHESTRATED
THESE CHANGES.
>> THERE IS NO INDICATION IN ANY
OF THESE EMAILS OF ANY PARTISAN
DELETING, SCRUBBING OF THE
FACTS.
>> Stephen: SHUT UP, CHRIS.
YOU'RE ON FOX NEWS, FOR GOD'S
SAKES.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN, WHAT PART OF "FAIR AND
BALANCEDDED" DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
ANYWAY, SO WHAT.
JONATHAN KARL DIDN'T NEED THE
ORIGINAL EMAIL.
HE HAS A SIMPLE EXPLANATION.
"THIS IS HOW I REPORTED THE
CONTENTS OF THAT EMAIL, QUOTING
VERBATIM A SOURCE WHO REVIEWED
THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS AND
SHARED DETAILED NOTES."
YES, KARL NEVER SAW THE EMAIL SO
WHEN HE QUOTED FROM IT, THOSE
QUOTES WERE IN QUOTES.
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU
CALL JOURNALISM.
NOW I WAS SURPRISED...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS PAST
SUNDAY JON KARL WASN'T ON "THIS
WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS"
OR AT THE VERY LEAST "WALKING
BACK YOUR STATEMENTS WITH THE
STARS."
BUT NATION, TOMORROW NIGHT, I
WILL HAVE AN EX-CLUES I'VE
INTERVIEW WITH JONATHAN KARL TO
DISCUSS THE BENGHAZI EMAILS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
THAT REALLY WASN'T NECESSARY.
I JUST RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION
EMAIL FROM JONATHAN KARL HIMSELF
IN WHICH HE WRITES, QUOTE, I
WOULD LOVE TO APPEAR ON THE
COLBERT REPORT.
MY NAME IS JONATHAN KARL.
P.S., MY LOWER BODY IS MOSTLY
RACOON.
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, I AM AWARE THAT SOME
QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN.
IS THAT EMAIL REAL?
YES.
DID I WRITE IT MYSELF?
PERHAPS.
DID I PERSONALLY SIGN UP FOR THE
EMAIL ADDRESS "HOT KARL 4 YOU AT
G-MAIL DOT-COM?
YES.
BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THIS STORY.
THE POINT IS, I QUOTED THAT
EMAIL VERBATIM.
AND IF NEED BE, I WILL GET
CONFIRMATION.
LET ME JUST MAKE A LITTLE CALL
HERE.
IT'S CONFIRMED.
ARE YOU SURE?
YES.
CONFIRMED.
