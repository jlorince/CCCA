>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS-- ( CHEERS )
FOLKS, IF YOU CHECK YOURCALENDARS, THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT
YESTERDAY WAS LABOR DAY MEANINGIT'S BACK-TO-SCHOOL TIME.
THE DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER.
THE AIR IS GETTING CRISPER, ANDPARENTS ARE SHELLING OUT GOOD
MONEY ON A NEW 5 SECONDS OFSUMMER BACKPACK, EVEN THOUGH THE
ONE DIRECTION BACKPACK FROM LASTYEAR IS PERFECTLY GOOD,
GODDAMN IT. I CANNOT TELL THEMAPART.
WHEN I WAS A KID, SCHOOL WASHARD, STARTED AT THE CRACK OF
DAWN AND HAD TO WALK UPHILL BOTHWAYS.
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY EXPECTED OFUS IN M.C. ESCHER HIGH.
GO, FIGHTIN' FISH WITH BIRDSBETWEEN THEM!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BIG FANS OF M.C. ESCHER HIGH.
TODAY, WE'VE GONE SOFT ON OURKIDS.
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THEPROFESSIONAL BOO-BOO KISSERS AT
THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OFPEDIATRICS.
>> ONLY 13% OF HIGH SCHOOLSTUDENTS GET THE OPTIMAL AMOUNT
OF SLEEP.
THAT'S EIGHT AND A HALF TO NINEAND A HALF HOURS.
THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OFPEDIATRICS BELIEVES THIS
CONTRIBUTES TO OBESITY, HIGHBLOOD PRESSURE AND DEPRESSION.
>> THE NATION'S LARGESTPEDIATRICIAN GROUP SAYS DELAYING
THE START OF MIDDLE AND HIGHSCHOOL CLASSES TO 8:30 A.M.
WOULD HELP TEENAGERS WITH THEIRHEALTH.
>> Stephen:  HOW WILL STARTINGSCHOOL LATER BE GOOD FOR KIDS'
HEALTH?
THEY'LL MISS THE CAFETERIABREAKFAST PIZZA.
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIZZA OFTHE DAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
ACCORDING TO THIS NEW POLICY,DELAYING START TIMES CAN IMPROVE
STUDENTS' MOTIVATION IN CLASSAND MOOD.
WELL, WHEN AMERICA'S LARGESTGROUP OF RESPECTED DOCTORS TELLS
ME ALLOWING TEENS TO SLEEP INCAN MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE
TO THEIR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE, IGOTTA SAY--
NICE TRY, KIDS. YOU ALMOST HADME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
USUALLY -- VERY CLOSE.
USUALLY, YOUR FAKE NOTES HAVE ADOCTOR'S SIGNATURE.
FOR THIS ONE, YOU MADE UP AWHOLE ACADEMY.
NICELY DONE.
WHAT'S NEXT, THE NATIONALORGANIZATION FOR THIGH BURN
AWARENESS RECOMMENDS NO MOREROPE CLIMBING IN GYM CLASS?
YOU GET UP THAT ROPE, MISTER.
IT BUILDS REAL-LIFE ROPE SKILLS.
SO YOU HIGH SCHOOL KIDS--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO YOU HIGH SCHOOL KIDS DO NOTNEED TO GO TO SCHOOL LATER.
YOU NEED TO GO TO BED EARLIER,BY WHICH I MEAN AFTER MIDNIGHT.
STAY AWAKE.
I'M STILL TALKING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
