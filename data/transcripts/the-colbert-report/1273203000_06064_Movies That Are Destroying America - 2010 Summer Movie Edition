>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
NATION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET, I HAVE A LOT OF ANGER TOWARDS MOVIES.
SOMETIMES I RENT D.V.D.s AND WATCH ONLY HALF JUST SO I CAN RETURN THEM WITHOUT REWINDING.
[LAUGHTER]
THESE ARE THE MOVIES THAT ARE DESTROYING AMERICA.
♪♪ SUMMER MOVIE EDITION.
AS ALWAYS, LET'S OVER TO THE CINEMATIC CRISIS ACTION CENTER.
[SIREN BLARING]
[APPLAUSE]
WOULD YOU LIKE BUTTER ON THAT BEER?
THE FIRST SUMMER MOVIE DESTROYING AMERICA, "PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME.
" NOW THIS IS ANOTHER MOVIE ADAPTED FROM A VIDEO GAME, WHICH
IS FINE, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT, YOU GOT TO DO IT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.
SO YOU CAN'T MAKE "PRINCE OF PERSIA" UNTIL YOU'VE FIRST MADE
"TETRIS: THE MOVIE." YOU KNOW WHO WOULD MAKE A CONVINCING UPRIGHT BLOCK?
KEANU REEVES.
IT'S THE ROLE HE WAS BORN TO PLAY.
BUT THE REAL THREAT HERE, FOLKS,
IS IT TURNS OUT THAT PERSIA IS A SECRET OLD-TIME TALK FOR IRAN.
AND THIS MOVIE IS FULL OF PRO-IRANIAN PROPAGANDA.
JIM?
>> THE GODS HAVE A PLAN FOR YOU.
ONLY THE DAGGER CAN UNLOCK THE SANDS OF TIME, AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD USE THIS POWER
TO DESTROY THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: LET'S SEE, A LIGHTLY-BEARDED PERSIAN SEEKING SOMETHING TO DESTROY THE WORLD.
HMMM, WHY DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?
AH-HA!
[APPLAUSE]
ONCE AGAIN, OH, I HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY.
ONCE AGAIN HOLLYWOOD IS GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO OUR ENEMIES BY GLAMORIZING THE LIFE STORY OF
IRANIAN PRESIDENT MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD.
HEY, HOLLYWOOD, THE PERSIANS ARE THE BAD GUYS.
YOU DON'T MAKE THEM HANDSOME SWASHBUCKLERS.
YOU DO LIKE IN "300" AND MAKE THEM OBESE, BLADE-ARMED TOAD MEN.
IT'S CALLED REALISM.
THE NEXT MOVIE DESTROYING AMERICA, "SEX AND THE CITY 2." NOW, THIS MOVIE IS THE STORY
OF -- AND I MEAN THIS IN THE NICEST WAY POSSIBLE -- FOUR SHOP HOLIK WHORES.
BUT UNTIL NOW, AT LEAST THEY WERE AMERICAN WHORES.
IN THIS MOVIE THEY CHEAT ON AMERICA WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY.
>> ONE WEEK IN ABU DHABI ALL EXPENSES PAID FOR ALL FOUR OF US.
>> GET OUT OF TOWN.
>> MY POINT EXACTLY.
I CAN HEAR THE DECADENCE CALLING.
>> CAN WE GET ANOTHER ROUND OF CHAMPAGNE.
>> YOU ARE FUN IN ABU DHABI.
>> Stephen: ABU DHABI?
ABU DHABI.
ABU DHABI.
[LAUGHTER]
OF ALL PLACES FOR A QUARTET OF EMPOWERED, SEXUALLY LIBERATED LOUIS VUI-TARTS TO RUN OFF TO,
WHY THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES,
PLACE WHERE THEY THROW COUPLES IN JAIL FOR KISSING IN PUBLIC.
I THINK THEY WOULD FROWN ON SAMANTHA PULLING A REVERSE WHEELBARROW ON HER HOTEL
BALCONY, WHICH IS I BELIEVE HOW SHE TIPS THE BELLMAN.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, NOT TO MENTION THIS MOVIE IS A COMPLETE LIE.
BOTH DUBAI AND ABU DHABI REFUSED TO LET THE FILM SHOOT THERE BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD THE WORD
"SEX" IN THE TITLE.
SO THE ABU DHABI MOVIE IS ACTUALLY FILMED IN MOROCCO.
AND NOW YOUR FAN BASE OF STRONG,
INDEPENDENT WOMEN WHO WILL DO ANYTHING SARAH JESSICA PARKER TELLS THEM TO WILL SEE THIS
MOVIE, CATCH FIRST FLIGHT TO THE EMIRATES, ONLY TO FIND THEMSELVES IN A COUNTRY OF
DEVOUT MUSLIMS WHERE THEY'LL BE FORCED TO DITCH THEIR [BLEEP]
PUMPS FOR CAN'T-SEE-ME BURQAS.
BUT MOST OF ALL, LADIES...
[APPLAUSE]
MOST OF ALL, LADIES -- AND I USE THAT WORD LOOSELY -- YOU SHOULD REMEMBER, YOU ARE AMERICAN
MATERIALISTIC SLUTS.
YOU SHOULD BE TRAMPING YOUR WAY DOWN THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN TO SPREAD YOUR LEGS FOR ANYTHING
WITH 5:00 SHADOW AND TELLING AMERICAN WOMEN THAT A FUN,
FULFILLING LIFE FOR A WOMAN MEANS BEHAVING LIKE A GAY MAN.
FINALLY, ONE MOVIE I CAN GET BEHIND, "IRONMAN 2."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, FOLKS, I LOVED THE "IRONMAN," AND THE NEW INSTALLMENT LOOKS EVEN MORE IRONY.
"IRONMAN 2" IS SURE TO BE GREAT FILM, FOLKS.
MY WON WORRY HERE IS THAT NOT EVERY PERSON ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET KNOWS ABOUT IT.
TRAILERS FOR MOVIE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN FED INTO THE UMBILICAL CORDS OF THE UNBORN OR FORCED
DOWN THE FEEDING TUBES OF THE COMATOSE OR PIPED INTO THE GRAVES OF THE RECENTLY DECEASED.
AND PARAMOUNT PICTURES TOTALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON PROMOTIONAL TIE-INS.
THEY LINED UP ONLY DR. PEPPER,
7-ELEVEN, AUDI, REESES PEANUT BUTTER CUP, BURGER KING, ROYAL PURPOSE L MOTOR OIL, DIESEL
COLOGNE, L.G. FUNDS AND LAND O'FROST LUNCH MEATS BECAUSE IF YOUR KIDS EAT ENOUGH LUNCH MEAT,
BY THE TIME HE'S TONY STARK'S AGE, HE TOO WILL NEED A REPLACEMENT HEART.
IN FACT, I CAN THINK OF A FEW PRODUCTS "IRONMAN 2" HAS NOT TEAMED UP WITH, LIKE THE GE
IRONMAN STEAM IRON.
THE ONLY THING IRON MAN HATES MORE THAN EVIL IS WRINKLES.
OR THE IRONMAN BRITTA WATER FILTER.
WARNING: DO NOT LET THE IRONMAN FILTER COME IN CONTACT WITH WATER.
OR IRONMAN VIAGRA.
IF YOUR MAN IS IRON FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS, CONSULT YOUR DR. DOOM.
[APPLAUSE]
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR MOVIES THAT ARE DESTROYING AMERICA.
REMEMBER, THE REAL THREAT ISN'T THE VANISHING I||||
