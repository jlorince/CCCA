(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
"REPORT," EVERYBODY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH, PLEASE,
NATION --
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU SO MUCH, PLEASE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU'RE TOO
KIND TO ME.
NATION, IT HAS BEEN 16 MONTHS
SINCE MITT ROMNEY DECLARED HIS
CANDIDACY-- A MONTH SINCE HE
ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION AND FIVE
DAYS SINCE HE STARTED RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, HE IS SURGING!
NEW POLLS HAVE HIM TIED WITH OR
LEADING THE PRESIDENT AND THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" 538 BLOG NOW
GIVES HIM A 28.6% CHANCE OF
WINNING!
HE IS ON A ROCKET RIDE TO
PLAUSIBLE!
(LAUGHTER)
AND, OF COURSE, IN THE FACE OF
THIS SURGE, OBAMA HAS BECOME
DESPERATE.
YESTERDAY AT A CALIFORNIA FUND
FUND-RAISER HE WARNED THE
AUDIENCE WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO
WIN SAYING "WE'RE ONLY GOING TO
DO IT IF EVERYBODY IS ALMOST
OBSESSIVE FOR THE NEXT 29 DAYS."
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT, OBAMA SUPPORTERS,
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ONLY LOGGED ON
TO HIS WEB SITE, FACEBOOK PAGE,
TWITTER FEED, YOUTUBE CHANNEL,
MOBILE APP, PINTEREST BOARD,
TUMBLR, FLICKR, SPOTIFY, STORIFY
AND INS GRAM.
HE NEEDS YOU TO COMMENCE!
FOLKS, I'M WORRIED OBAMA'S
FOLLOWERS ARE OBSESSIVE ENOUGH
TO PULL THIS THING OFF.
ACTUALLY, I THINK THEY'RE
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE.
HOW ELSE COULD HE HAVE RAISED
$181 MILLION IN DONATIONS LAST
MONTH-- 98% OF WHICH WERE UNDER
$250!
CLEARLY HIS FOLLOWERS CLICK THE
"DONATE" BUTTON, TOUCH ALL THE
DOORKNOBS IN THEIR HOUSE, DONATE
AGAIN, THEN RECHECK THE
DOORKNOBS BECAUSE LAST TIME THEY
MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED ONE OF THEM
IN THE WRONG SPOT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO FOR THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH I
WANT TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE OBAMA
SUPPORTERS OUT THERE.
GUYS, THE PRESIDENT'S COUNTING
ON YOU TO BE OBSESSIVE.
SO ON NOVEMBER 6-YOU SHOULD
DEFINITELY GO VOTE AFTER, OF
COURSE, TURNING THE LIGHT SWITCH
ON AND OFF FIVE TIMES INSTEAD OF
THREE, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S
WHY HE LOST THE DEBATE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND BEFORE YOU LEAVE FOR THE
POLL, MAKE SURE YOUR D.V.D.s ARE
NOT ONLY ALPHABETICAL AND FACING
RIGHT BUT THE DISKS INSIDE HAVE
THEIR LABELS ORIENTED TO 12:00.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, THEN GO TO THE CLOSET AND
MAKE SURE THE LACES ON ALL YOUR
ST. LOUIS THE EXACT SAME LENGTH.
THEN GET OUT YOUR KEY SQUARE AND
ALIGN ALL THE TUPPERWARE IN YOUR
FRINGE AT PERFECT RIGHT ANGLES.
THEN BACK TO THE SHOES BECAUSE I
THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE MISLACED
ONE OF THE EYE HOLES.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK THOSE
DOORKNOBS AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
THEN GO VOTE FOR OBAMA.
OH, AFTER YOU FOUND THE LOAF OF
BREAD THAT I'VE HIDDEN IN YOUR
HOUSE WITH THE HEEL TAKEN OUT,
REVERSED AND THEN PUT BACK IN
TWO SPLICES IN, OKAY.
(APPLAUSE)
