WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, THANK YOU.
I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT 'EM.I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT 'EM.
I'M BUT ONE MAN.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I COULD NOT DOTHIS SHOW WITHOUT YOU.
I AM BUT ONE MAN.
YOU ARE THE NATION.
AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOUWATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I
BELIEVE IN AMERICA'S JUDICIALSYSTEM. WHENEVER ANYBODY ASKS I
SAY, "OUR COURTS ARE THE BEST."
UNLESS THEY'RE ASKING ME TOSERVE JURY DUTY IN WHICH CASE I
SAY, "HITLER HAD SOMEGOOD IDEAS."
THAT USUALLY GETS ME SENT HOME MACH SCHNELL .
SO I'VE BEEN PAYING PRETTY CLOSEATTENTION TO THE SUPREME COURT
WHICH JUST TODAY OVERTURNED AKEY PROVISION OF THE VOTING
RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 WHICHREQUIRED THE JIM CROW STATES TO
GET FEDERAL PERMISSION BEFORECHANGING ANY OF THEIR VOTING
LAWS.
THANKFULLY, CHIEF JUSTICE JOHNROBERTS, OLD BLUE EYES, KNOWS
THAT THE SOUTH DOESN'T NEED TOBE BABYSAT ANYMORE SAYING,
QUOTE, NEARLY 50 YEARS LATERTHINGS HAVE CHANGED
DRAMATICALLY.
YES, FOR SOME REASON SINCE THEVOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS PASSED,
THINGS HAVE CHANGEDDRAMATICALLY.
THEREFORE, WE CAN GET RID OF ITNOW.
IT'S JUST LIKE THOSE OUTDATEDLABOR LAWS THAT PROHIBIT
CHILDREN FROM THREADING BOBBINSON A LOOM.
A KID HASN'T BEEN SUCKED INTOONE OF THOSE MACHINES IN YEARS.
LET'S STOP PLAYING NANNY HERE.
I'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS IMPORTANTDECISION LATER IN THE SHOW WITH
MY GUEST PROFESSOR PENIELJOSEPH.
I HEAR HE'S BLACK.
