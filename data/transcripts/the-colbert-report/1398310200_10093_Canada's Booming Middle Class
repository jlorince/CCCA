HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN,FOLKS, IN HERE AND IF
ANYBODY AT HOME IS STANDINGUP TAKE A SQUAT, FOLKS, YOU
WATCH THIS SHOW.
YOU KNOW I LOVE NUMBEREDLISTS.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
I COULD GO ON.
THE MAIN REASON I LOVE THEMIS BECAUSE AMERICA IS ALWAYS
AT THE TOP.
WE ARE NUMBER ONE INBILLIONAIRES, WORKER
PRODUCTIVITY, AND PERCENTAGEOF POPULATION BEHIND BARS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: YES.
HELL YEAH!
EAT THAT RWANDA.
BUT SADLY I MAY BE FALLINGOUT OF LOVE WITH LISTS.
HERE'S THE NUMBER ONE REASONWHY.
>> HELLO, CANADA, YOU ARENUMBER ONE.
THAT'S THE FINDING AT A NEWREPORT CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS
PASSING AMERICA.
FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THEMOST AFFLUENT IN THE WORLD.
>> IN CANADA AVERAGE INCOMEWORKERS HAVE ENJOYED A
NEARLY 20% RAISE SINCE 2000.
BUT HERE IN THE U.S. MIDDLECLASS WORKERS WAGES HAVE
BEEN VIRTUALLY FLAT FOR 14YEARS.
>> THE U.S. HAS NOW BEENSURPASSED BY THE MIDDLE
CLASS IN CANADA.
>> YES, CANADA'S MIDDLECLASS IS BEATING OURS.
THEIR WORKERS ARE BRINGINGHOME MORE OF THE BACON.
AND WORSE, IT'S THAT ROUND[BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)NO LONGER WILL PEOPLE AROUND
THE WORLD ASPIRE TO THEAMERICAN DREAM OF A HOUSE, A
WHITE PICKET FENCE, 2.5 KIDS.
NO, NOW IT'S THE CANADIANDREAM OF A BEAVER DAM, A
MAPLE SYRUP MOAT AND 2.5MEMBERS OF RUSH.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUTI DON'T WANT TO TEACH GEDDY
LEE TO PLAY CATCH.
HOW IS CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASSDOING SO WELL?
I MEAN THEY'VE GOTSOCIALIZED MEDICINE,
SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE ANDHIGH TAXES FOR THE RICH.
I MEAN IT POLITELY BOGGLESTHE MIND.
(LAUGHTER)I THINK THERE ARE ONLY TWO
POSSIBLE REASONS WHY WE AREFALLING BEHIND THE ICE HOLES.
ONE, ONE POSSIBLE REASON,AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS IS
LAZY.
OR TWO, AMERICA DOESN'T HAVEENOUGH TAX CUTS FOR THE
WEALTHY.
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THATONE, OKAY.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS.
HOW CAN WE RICH TRICKLEDOWN PROSPERITY TO EVERYONE
ELSE UNLESS WE HAVE ALL THEMONEY FIRST.
OUR CUP MUST FILLETHBEFORE IT RUNNETH OVER.
CLEARLY CONGRETH HATH ESTIMATETH THE SIZE OF MY
CUPPETH.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSEYOUR FAITH IN SUPPLY-SIDE
ECONOMICS.
BECAUSE THE TOP 1% ARE LIKEA SLOT MACHINE.
WE'RE ALL WARMED UP AND JUSTABOUT TO PAY OFF, OKAY.
JUST KEEP SHOVING IN THOSEQUARTERS.
I DON'T EVEN CARE WHERE YOUPUT THEM.
JUST WARM THEM UP FIRST.
