THAN EZRA ON THEIR HEAD PHONES.
I'M HIP TO THE SCENE.
THERE'S A NEW WAY FOR
REPUBLICANS TO APPEAL TO
YOUNGSTERS AND IT'S THE SUBJECT
OF TONIGHT'S WORD.
SHOCK THE VOTE.
ONE CONSERVATIVE HAS FIGURED OUT
HOW TO REACH THE COVETED YOUTH
AUDIENCE.
KENNETH DELVECHIO, A FORMER PART
TIME NEW JERSEY JUDGE AND SENATE
CANDIDATE.
DELVECHIO OR D TO THE V AS NO
ONE CALLS HIM KNOWS THERE'S NO
WAY TO GET TO KIDS LIKE FINAL
DESTINATION, DRAG ME TO HELL AND
SEX IN THE STAY 2.
IT'S TERRIFYING.
TO APPEAL TO THE CHILDREN OUT
THERE HE WROTE AND PRODUCED A
PROLIFE HORROR FILM CALLED THE
LIFE ZONE.
>> YOU HAVE ALL COMMITTED A
TERRIBLE SIN.
I AM YOUR JAILER.
>> YOU ARE ALL ON THE OPERATING
TABLE.
ALL READY TO COMMIT MURDER.
>> YOU MUST --
>> YOU KIDNAPPED.
>> YOU WILL STAY HERE IN THISs
ROOM FOR THE NEXT SEVEN MONTHS
UNTIL YOU SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVE
BIRTH TO YOUR CHILDREN.
IT'S A MOVIE WITH ALL THE TERROR
OF KNOCKED UP.
THE LIFE ZONE IS ABOUT THREE
PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE HELD
CAPTIVE BY A SADISTIC JAILER WHO
TRIES TO CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT
ABORTION BY FORCING THEM TO
CARRY THEIR BABIES TO TERM.
AND FOLKS, JUST LIKE ALL GREAT
HORROR FILMS THE MOVIE HAS A
SHOCKING TWIST.
[LAUGHTER]
AT THE END -- AT THE END IT IS
REVEALED ALL ALONG THE WOMEN HAD
BEEN IN PERG TORY AFTER HAVING
DIED ON THE OPERATING TABLE OF
ABORTION CLINICS BUT THE FILM
ISN'T SOME KIND OF PREACHY RIGHT
WING SERMON.
HE EXPLAINED, I THINK THE
AUDIENCE WILL WALK AWAY NOT
KNOWING WHAT THE FILMMAKERS
POSITION IS.
IT GIVES BOTH SIDES OF COIN.
IT GIVES THE SIDE WHERE THE
WOMEN WHO HAVE THEIR BABY GOES
TO HEAVEN AND THE OTHER SIDE OF
COIN WHERE THE WOMAN WHO DOESN'T
GOES TO HELL.
THE VIEWER CAN CHOOSE WHO IS
RIGHT.
I BELIEVE HE IS ON TO SOMETHING
HERE.
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BRAIN WASHED BY
POP CULTURE ALL THE TIME.
BUT I SAY --
[LAUGHTER]
-- IF THIS MOVIE WORKS WHY STOP
AT ABORTION.
HORROR MOVIES TARGETED TO YOUTH
AUDIENCES CAN PROMOTE ALL OF OUR
TRADITIONAL VALUES.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR INSTANCE, I FOR ONE WOULD
LIKE TO SEE A REMAKE OF CARRIE
WHERE SHE'S HOME SCHOOLED.
THAT WAY THERE'S NO PROM, NO
TAUNTING, NO BUCKET OF BLOOD AND
SHE GETS A FULL SCHOLARSHIP TO
LIBERTY UNIVERSITY.
[LAUGHTER]
OR HOW ABOUT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK THIS COULD GO PRETTY
WELL WITH THE KIDS, A MOVIE TO
CONVERT VEGETARIANS WHERE THE
AUSTRALIAN GUY FROM OUTBACK
STEAKHOUSE KIDNAPS A VEGAN,
IMPRISONS HIM INSIDE A COW AND
FORCES HIM TO EAT HIS WAY OUT.
OR --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OR A MOVIE THAT PROTECTS
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE WHERE A GAY
GUY AND A LESBIAN ARE STITCHED
TOGETHER JUNK TO JUNK BY A MAD
MORALISTIC SCIENTIST UNTIL THEY
REALIZE HOW GOOD IT FEELS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO SHOW THE
HORRORS OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE
THAN WITH THE RELEASE OF TEXAS
CHAINSAW MEDICARE.
I DIDN'T WANT LEDGER FACE AS
MY -- LEATHER FACE AS MY PRIMARY
CARE PHYSICIAN BUT WITH OBAMA
CARE I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
AND THE NEXT MOVIE WILL BE ABOUT
OUR NEW REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.
THAT IS M
