(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: HEY!
WELCOME! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
NATION, IT'S GETTING COLDER ANDCOLDER OUTSIDE AND I'M STARTING
TO DEVELOP A HANKERING FORSPICED, ALCOHOLIC, DRINKABLE EGG
-- WHICH MEANS CHRISTMAS ISRIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.
NOW, USUALLY, I'D BE BRINGINGYOU NEWS FROM THE FRONT IN THE
WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
SAY, SOME BLASPHEMER WHOCONFUSED BALTHAZAR FOR MELCHIOR
OR REFUSED TO TICKLE ELMO.
I MEAN, IT IS THE LORD'S WILL!
DID ELMO DIE FOR NOTHING?!
(LAUGHTER)BUT THIS YEAR IN THE WAR ON
CHRISTMAS, CHRISTMAS IS FIGHTINGBACK.
THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ONGRINCHITUDE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> HO, HO, HO!
(SINGING)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BACK AT YA, BIGGUY!
FOLKS, CHRISTMAS NEEDS A HEROONCE AGAIN.
AND THIS YEAR, THANK GOD IT'ST.G.I. FRIDAYS.
>> T.G.I. FRIES SAYS IT WILL BEFLYING DRONES AROUND SOME OF ITS
RESTAURANTS WITH A MISTLETOEATTACHED TO THE DRONES.
THE DRONES ARE SMALL ENOUGH TOCRUISE OVERHEAD, GUARANTEEING
SOME AWKWARD MOMENTS FOR COUPLESAND STRANGERS ALIKE.
THE RESTAURANT SAYS THEY HOPETHIS WILL ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS
TO, QUOTE, MAKE THEIR MOVE.
A DRONE ENCOURAGING YOU TO KISS.
>> Stephen: YES, T.G.I.
FRIDAYS IS WEAPONIZING CHRISTMASCHEER WITH A MISTLETOE DRONE
THAT FORCES YOU TO KISS.
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEPIN MIND BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR DAD
TO LUNCH.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA THIS IS
THE ONLY THING MISSING FROM YOURBOOZEY NIGHT OUT WAS FOUR
WHIRLING BLADES STEERED BY A16-YEAR-OLD BUSBOY.
PLUS, UNLIKE OLD-FASHIONEDNON-AUTONOMOUS MISTLETOE, YOU
CAN'T AVOID THIS ONE BECAUSE ITBRINGS THE FORCED PUBLIC
INTIMACY TO YOU!
IT EVEN HAS AN HD KISS CAM TOBROADCAST YOUR SMOOCH TO THE
WHOLE RESTAURANT. KISS HER!
WHICH IS NOT ONLY A HECK OF ALOT OF NAUGHTY FUN, BUT ALSO
GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO ASK YOURWAITER...
WHERE THE HELL IS MY JACKDANIELS SAMPLER BASKET?!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)OKAY?
ALL RIGHT?
AND I'LL TAKE ANOTHER DIET COKEAND MALIBU, PLEASE!
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS...
T.G.I. FRIDAYS' MISTLETOE DRONEIS NOT JUST A GREAT WAY TO
SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER, IBELIEVE IT COULD BE A GREAT
NEW WEAPON IN THE WAR ONTERROR.
BECAUSE I.S.I.S. MAY SHOWBLATANT DISREGARD FOR BASIC
HUMAN DECENCY, BUT SURELY EVENTHEY RESPECT THE INTERNATIONAL
LAW OF MISTLETOING.
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING ON THECHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF TO HARNESS THISTECHNOLOGY.
I ASSUME HE ALSO WORKS AT T.G.I.
FRIDAYS.
LOOK AT ALL THAT FLAIR.
GENERAL DEMPSEY SIR, DEPLOY AFLEET
OF MISTLETOE DRONES TO IRAQAND SYRIA IMMEDIATELY.
ONCE THE TERRORISTS SEE THATFESTIVE SPRIG HOVERING
OVERHEAD, al-BAGHDADI AND HISTOP LIEUTENANT WILL HAVE TO KISS
EACH OTHER.
(LAUGHTER)AND THEN THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY
BE STONED TO DEATH.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
