THANK YOU.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK,
I WAS BONING UP ON RULES OF
ETIQUETTE WHEN MEETING THE
QUEEN.
RULE NUMBER ONE, WHEN MEETING
THE QUEEN, NEVER SAY BONING UP.
AND NOW THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION
OF MY FAIR COLBERT:  STEPHEN
COLBERT'S CROWN JEWELS.
♪ ♪
IT WAS TIME TO PUT ON MY PALACE
FINERY SO HUGO AND I HEADED TO
BROOKS BROTHERS TO GET ME SOME
DUDS.
>> YOU'VE DONE PRETTY WELL SO
FAR.
NOW WE HAVE TO GET YOU KITTED
OUT BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT DO.
WE HAVE GOOD WEDDING CLOTHES FOR
YOU.
THEY PUT EVERYTHING YOU COULD
POSSIBLY NEED.
>> TIES, PURPLE.
>> IT'S A SINGLE TIE THAT IS
NOT --
>> NO, NO.
>> Stephen: IT'S YOU.
COME ON.
>> WHAT ABOUT YOUR REGIMENT?
>> EXCUSE ME.
>> WERE YOU IN THE MARINES.
>> Stephen: I WAS IN A MARINA
CORPS.
A MARINA.
>> DOES IT HAVE A TIE.
>> Stephen: NO TIE.
WE WORE HANDCUFFS.
>> THAT IS A POSSIBILITY.
THIS IS A POSSIBILITY.
>> Stephen: NO, NO.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: NO, NO.
OKAY.
SORRY I JUST -- I'M USED TO
DRESSING MYSELF SINCE MY MID
30s.
HOW DO YOU WIN THE WEDDING?
>> YOU ARE WINNING BY GOING TO
THE WEDDING IN THE FIRST PLACE.
>> Stephen: I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT OVER
THERE.
IN AMERICA YOU WIN BY TAGGING
ONE OF BRIDESMAIDS.
WHAT ABOUT LIKE A MESH THONG?
>> AS LONG AS IT ISN'T SEEN.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT SHOWING THE WHALE TAIL
BACK THERE.
BUT IT IS THE PRESENCE OF WALES
SO THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
HUGO TURNED ME OVER TO THE
CAPABLE HANDS OF ALBERTO, THE
TAILOR.
YEAH.
WHAT?
DO THAT AGAIN.
>> WE'LL GET IT RIGHT.
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YES, I FEEL IT.
I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT.
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I DRESS
LEFT OR RIGHT.
>> THE COMFORT MATTER WHICHEVER
WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF A DUCT
TAPE IT UP LIKE I DO ON SATURDAY
NIGHTS AT BRAGGING DRAGON.
I GO ON AT 8:00.
AS HE WORKED MANY HIS -- WORKED
HIS MAGIC, I REFLECTED ON HOW
FAR I'D COME.
