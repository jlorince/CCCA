DOESN'T COST THAT MUCH.
NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,
YOU KNOW I DON'T MINCE WORDS.
I HAVE A LITTLE GUATEMALAN WOMAN
WHO MINCES THEM FOR ME.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WALL OF
THE FINGER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOLKS, EVER SINCE THE TRAGIC
EVENTS IN BENGHAZI LAST YEAR
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GATHER ALL
THE FACTS BUT THERE ARE TWO
THINGS WE KNOW: ONE, HILLARY
CLINTON IS COMPLETELY TO BLAME.
AND TWO, BARACK OBAMA IS
COMPLETELY TO BLAME.
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ONE OF THOSE
STORIES WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH
ABOUT LATELY BECAUSE IT HASN'T
PASSED THROUGH A ROYAL BIRTH
CANAL OR TAKEN A PICTURE OF ITS
OWN PENIS.
BUT ONE MAN OUT THERE IS
FIGHTING TO BRING BENGS AY BACK
INTO THE NEWS WHICH IS WHY I'M
GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO TEXAS
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND
REALTOR YOU FOUND ON A BENCH AD,
STEVE STOCKMAN.
JIM?
>> NEW PUSH FOR ANSWERS ON
BENGHAZI IN A BIG WAY ON THE
HILL.
SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS
BREAKING RANKS DEMANDING A
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION.
>> WE ARE LIVE ON THE STEPS OF
THE CAPITOL FOR A RALLY BEING
HELD BY SPECIAL OPERATION VETS
AS THEY UNROLL WHAT THEY'RE
CALLING, QUOTE, THE LARGEST EVER
PETITION TO CONGRESS.
>> LITERALLY, A 60-FOOT LONG
SCROLL OF VETERAN SIGNATURES WHO
WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO
HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
A 60-FOOT LONG PETITION.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF
YOU TOOK 60 SUBWAY FOOT LONGS
AND LINED THEM UP ON THE STEPS
OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING SOMEBODY
WOULD DEFINITELY START A
PETITION TO GET THOSE SANDWICHES
OUT OF THERE.
THEY'RE GOING TO DRAW RATS.
OF COURSE, YOU MAY BE WONDERING
HOW MANY NAMES CAN YOU FIT ON A
60-FOOT SCROLL?
QUARTER OF A MILLION?
900,000?
WELL, PREPARE YOURSELF, NATION,
BECAUSE REPRESENTATIVE
STOCKMAN'S PETITION HAS ONE
POINT 1 THOUSAND SIGNATURES ON
IT.
IT WAS 999 NORMAL-SIZED
SIGNATURES AND ONE PERSON WHO
LIKES TO DOT HER I'S WITH TWO
MILLION TINY HEARTS.
NATION, I'D LIKE TO SHOW MY
SUPPORT FOR STEVE STOCKMAN'S
BOLD EMPTY GESTURE WITH A BOLD
EMPTY GESTURE OF MY OWN WHICH IS
WHY I'M TAKING A 65-FOOT
PETITION TO CONGRESS.
NOT ONLY IS IT FIVE FEET LONGER
THAN CONGRESSMAN STOCKMAN'S.
IT'S ALSO TWO PLY.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW
FOLKS?
THROUGH THE STAIRS I'M GOING TO
COVER THE ENTIRE CAPITOL
BUILDING WITH MY PETITION.
IF IT RAINS THEY'LL NEVER GET IT
OFF.
NEXT UP FOLKS WE ALL KNOW
PORNOGRAPHY IS A PROBLEM ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP
OF MY HAT TO BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER DAVID CAMERON FOR
FINALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT
IT.
>> DAVID CAMERON CRACKING DOWN
ON INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY TODAY
ROLLING OUT A PLAN THAT WOULD
ADD ADULT CONTENT FILTERS ON
EVERYTHING FROM COMPUTERS TO
SMARTPHONES TO PUBLIC WI-FI
NETWORKS.
>> Stephen: YES, NOW IT WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR BRITISH YOUTH TO
SEE PORNOGRAPHY UNLESS THEY CAN
SOMEHOW GAIN ACCESS TO PAGE 3 OF
THE SUN.
AND IT'S NOT JUST PICTURE AND
VIDEO, FOLKS.
THE PRIME MINISTER IS ALSO
PLANNING TO CENSOR KEY SEARCH
TERMS MAKING IT A LOT HARDER TO
GOOGLE THE PHRASE "MAKING IT A
LOT HARDER."
BUT BRITISH INTERNET USERS WHO
WANT THEIR MEAT AND TWO VEG CAN
STILL SEE IT BECAUSE USERS WILL
BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF THE
SETTING BY REQUEST.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU ENGLISH CAN STILL ENJOY YOUR
BRIT-ROTICA.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK FOR
IT.
>> PLEASE, SIR.
I WANT SOME (DEEP MALE VOICE)
PORN.
>> WHAT?
I WANT SOME (STEPHEN'S
VOICE:) PORN
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: FINALLY, AS A PROUD
SON OF SOUTH CAROLINA, FOLKS, I
RARELY HAVE KIND WORDS FOR THOSE
BARBARIANS TO THE NORTH.
I MEAN, WHO MAKES BARBECUE SAUCE
WITH VINEGAR?
THAT'S WHAT YOU USE TO CLEAN A
TOILET.
WHEN I SAY TOILET, I MEAN
CHARLOTTE.
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, THEIR
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED STATE
LEGISLATURE IS TURNING NORTH
CAROLINA INTO A CONSERVATIVE
SHANGRI-LA PROPOSING FOR PASSING
BILLS THAT WOULD MAKE COUPLES
WAIT TWO YEARS TO DIVORCE,
DECLARE AN OFFICIAL STATE
RELIGION AND REMOVE THE
REQUIREMENT THAT CHARTER SCHOOL
TEACHERS HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE.
GREAT MOVE.
I MEAN, WHO BETTER TO TEACH
FIFTH GRADE THAN A 6th
GRADER.
IT'S STILL FRESH IN HIS MIND.
NOT TO MENTION AN INDECENCY BILL
THAT WOULD MAKE IT A FELONY TO
EXPOSE A NIPPLE FOR THE PURPOSES
OF AROUSAL.
SO, NORTH CAROLINA STRIPPERS, BE
SURE TO ADD A SIGN ON YOUR CHEST
THAT READS "FOR EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY."
WELL, FOLKS, ALL THOSE BILLS
WERE JUST FOREPLAY, WHICH I
BELIEVE IS ALSO ILLEGAL IN NORTH
CAROLINA.
BECAUSE I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY
HAT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA
LEGISLATURE FOR MY FAVORITE
RESOLUTION YET.
>> HOUSE BILL 937 APPROVED
TUESDAY BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE
ALLOWS CONCEALED HANDGUN PERMIT
HOLDERS TO BRING THEIR WEAPONS
TO BARS AND RESTAURANTS THAT
SERVE ALCOHOL.
CONCEALED WEAPONS HOLDERS WILL
ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CARRY THEIR
GUNS ON GREEN WAYS, PLAYGROUNDS
AND OTHER PUBLIC RECREATION
AREAS
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW YOU CAN BRING GUNS TO
PLAYGROUNDS AND, FOLKS, WE NEED
THEM BECAUSE THE MONKEY BARS ARE
WELL KNOWN AL QAEDA TRAINING
GROUNDS.
PLUS GUNS WILL MAKE THE WHOLE
PLAYGROUND EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE
FUN.
INSTEAD OF DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE,
YOU CAN JUST PLAY DUCK, DUCK,
DUCK!
AND GUNS WILL MEAN MUCH LESS
WORK FOR BUSY PARENTS WHO ARE
TIRED OF PUSHING THEIR KIDS ON
THE SWINGS, AS YOU CAN SEE IN
THIS COLBERT REPORT EXCLUSIVE
GRAPHIC SIMULATION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
