THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'Eç Gj
t TO SAY HI TO EVERYBODYpHERE, EVERYBODY
ALL MY COUSINS BY THE DOZENS.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK
PERRY HAS BEEN IN THE RACE ONLY
THREE DAYS AND HE'S ALREADY
BLOWING AWAY THE COMPETITION
LIKE IT'S A TRESPASSING COYOTE.
[LAUGHTER]
IN THE VERY FIRST POLL PERRY HAS
AN 11-POINT LEAD.
ELEVEN!
JIM, LET'S TURN THE GOVERNOR'S
COLLAR UP TO 11.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS EARLY LEAD IS NO SURPRISE
CONSIDERIN' THE STRAIGHT
SHOOTIN' PERRY'S BEEN DOIN' ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
>> WE'RE CALLING TODAY ON THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON
REGULATIONS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY,
BECAUSE HIS REGULATIONS, HIS EPA
REGULATIONS ARE KILLING JOBS ALL
ACROSS AMERICA.
>> Stephen: YES.
ANY CANDIDATE CAN SAY THE
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
IS KILLING JOBS.
BUT ONLY PARRY GOES THE EXTRA
STEP, AND SAYS IT WHILE KILLING
THE ENVIRONMENT WITH HIS IDLING
BUS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TRUE, TRUE.
AND -- CAN I ALMOST SMELL IT
AND HE'S RIGHT.
EPA REGULATIONS ARE KILLING
JOBS.
I RECENTLY HAD TO FIRE MY
aSBESTOS TASTER.
IT'S A SHAME.
HE REALLY NEEDS THE HEALTH
INSURANCE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO TONIGHT, I TOAST GOVERNOR
PERRY'S CALL TO END REGULATION
WITH THIS CHAMPAGNE FLUTE OF
LEAD PAINT.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MMM.
SEMI GLOSS?
[LAUGHTER]
THE MORE I DRINK, THE MORE SENSE
A PRESIDENT RICK PERRY MAKES.
AND FOLKS, PERRY HAS ALREADY
LIFTED ALL
THE REGULATIONS ON HIS MOUTH.
LIKE WHEN HE SAID THIS ABOUT FED
CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE.
>> IF THIS GUY PRINTS MORE MONEY
BETWEEN NOW AND THE ELECTION, I
DUNNO WHAT Y'ALL WOULD DO TO HIM
IN IOWA BUT WE WOULD TREAT HIM
PRETTY UGLY DOWN IN TEXAS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD, THEY'D
MAKE HIM LIVE IN HOUSTON.
[LAUGHTER]
PERRY'S CLEARLY GOT THE BIGGEST
HUEVOS RANCHEROS IN THIS RACE.
WHICH IS WHY COLBERT SUPER PAC
HAS BEEN BEATING BACK ALL THESE
WANNABE SUPER PACS TO BECOME
PERRY'S OFFICIAL UNOFFICIAL
NON-CONNECTED INDEPENDENT
EXPENDITURE ALL YOU CAN EAT
MONEY TROUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, WHILE MY SUPERPAC IS
LEGALLY FORBIDDEN FROM
COORDINATING WITH HIS CAMPAIGN,
I THINK HE LIKES ME BACK.
[LAUGHTER]
EXHIBIT A: THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS
ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY IN
CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA,
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM MY
CHILDHOOD HOME!
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO GET MY
ATTENTION!
HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE STOOD IN
MY DRIVEWAY WITH A BOOM BOX OVER
HIS HEAD.
♪IN YOUR EYES... THE LIGHT THE
HEAT ♪
♪IN YOUR EYES, I AM COMPLETE ♪
♪IN YOUR EYES, I SEE THE
DOORWAYS TO A THOUSAND CHURCHES
YOUR EYES♪
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M SORRY.
HE JUST WON'T GET OFF THE LAWN
OF MY HEART.
[LAUGHTER]
EXHIBIT B: JUST YESTERDAY
"THE ATLANTIC" BROKE THE STORY
THAT THE NEW TREASURER OF
GOVERNOR PERRY'S CAMPAIGN IS ONE
SALVATORE PURPURA, WHO ALSO
HAPPENS TO BE THE TREASURER OF
COLBERT SUPER PAC!
[LAUGHTER]
I WAS NOT PREPARED TO BE THAT
SHOCKED THAT QUICKLY.
LET'S TRY THATu
/|Ñi AGAIN.[LAUGHTER]my
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'D NOW LIKE TO GIVE YOU MY
EXCLUSIVE REACTION TO THIS
CAMPAIGN-SHATTERING NEWS, BUT I
CAN'T BECAUSE POLITICO ALREADY
SCOOPED ME.
LAST NIGHT THEY TRACKED DOWN
THIS STEPHEN COLBERT PERSON AND
OBTAINED THE FOLLOWING
STATEMENT:
>> WE'RE NOT SURPRISED.
SAL IS THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHY WE WENT WITH HIM.
WE'RE HAPPY FOR SAL AND WE ARE
EVEN HAPPIER THAT GOVERNOR PERRY
HAS SENT THE CLEAR SIGNAL OF
WHICH SUPER PAC HE TRUSTS TO
RECEIVE ALL THAT UNLIMITED MONEY
WAITING TO POUR IN ON HIS
BEHALF.
LOUD AND CLEAR, SIR.
UNOFFICIALLY, LOUD AND CLEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I COULDN'T HAVE SAID
IT BETTER MYSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
POINT IS, RICK PERRY IS TAKING
SLOPPY SECONDS ON MY TREASURER,
WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT MY
OPERATION -- HOW MUCH MONEY I'VE
RAISED, HOW MUCH THESE PEOPLE
DOWN HERE HAVE GIVEN ME, MY
PASSWORD TO ADULT FRIEND FINDER.
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, IN POLITICS YOU GOTTA PRESS
THE FLESH.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO
EMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS NO
COORDINATION BETWEEN COLBERT
SUPER PAC AND THE PERRY
CAMPAIGN.
THAT WOULD BE WRONG AND ILLEGAL.
THEY'RE AS SEPARATE AS CHURCH
AND STATE UNDER A PERRY
ADMINISTRATION.
