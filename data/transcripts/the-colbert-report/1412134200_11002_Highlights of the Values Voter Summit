(LAUGHTER)NATION, THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION IS JUST AROUND THECORNER, WHERE IT IS WAITING TO
HIT AMERICA WITH A BOARD THATHAS NAILS STICKING OUT OF IT.
REPUBLICANS ARE ALREADY WARMINGUP FOR THE BIG FIGHT.
LAST WEEKEND THEY GATHERED FORTHE 9TH ANNUAL "VALUES VOTER
SUMMIT."
A FOUR-DAY ORGY OF PEOPLEFUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO ORGIES.
(LAUGHTER)THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT
SPEAKERS, AND ALSO SARAH PALIN,WHO URGED THE AUDIENCE TO NEVER
BACK DOWN.
>> THEY SCREAM RACISM JUST TOEND DEBATE.
WELL, DON'T RETREAT.
YOU RELOAD WITH TRUTH, WHICH IKNOW IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES
AT, UH, 1400 PENNSYLVANIAAVENUE, ANYWAY.
TRUTH.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: YES, TRUTH IS IN
SHORT SUPPLY AT 1400PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.
(LAUGHTER)EVERYONE THERE KEEPS INSISTING
IT'S A PLAZA IN FRONT OF THEWILLARD HOTEL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT YOU WON'T HEAR ANY OF THAT
FROM THE LIBERAL NBC NEWS OVERAT 20 ROCK.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, THE VALUES VOTER
SUMMIT HOLDS THE FIRST BIG STRAWPOLL OF EVERY PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.
THIS YEAR'S WINNER WAS TED CRUZWHO SURGED TO 25% OF THE VOTE UP
FROM 42% IN 2013.
(LAUGHTER)TED CRUZ, TO KNOW HIM IS TO
"EH."
(LAUGHTER)BUT WHEN IT COMES TO 2016, I'M
JINDAL ALL THE WAY.
GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL FINISHED ASTRONG FOURTH IN THE STRAW POLL
AND I'M NOT SURPRISED.
BOBBY JINDAL'S A TWO-TERMGOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA, A
CHAMPION OF SMALL BUSINESS, ANDSTARTING THIS YEAR, HE'S ALLOWED
TO STAY OUT PAST 11:00.
UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S GOT A FEWSKELETONS IN HIS CLOSET.
HE'S A RHODES SCHOLAR WITH AMASTERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
FROM OXFORD, AND HE RAN THEUNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA SYSTEM.
HE'S AN ACADEMIC, OR AS ONESENIOR CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST
DESCRIBED HIM...
(YELLING INCOHERENTLY)YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO HAUNT HIM!
(APPLAUSE)AND LAST YEAR JINDAL LECTURED
THE BASE ABOUT THE G.O.P.'SELECTORAL PROBLEMS.
>> WE HAVE GOT TO STOP INSULTINGTHE INTELLIGENCE OF VOTERS.
WE NEED TO TRUST THE SMARTS OFTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP BEING THESTUPID PARTY
>> STEPHEN: WELL, I SAY, IFBEING SO STUPID YOU CAN'T
COMPLETE A METAPHOR IS WRONG,THEN MAKE LEMONADE!
(LAUGHTER)AND JINDAL'S PRO-KNOWLEDGE
AGENDA HAS HURT HIS POPULARITY.
IN RECENT CNN, ORC, WNBA POLL OFNEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICANS,
JINDAL GOT ONLY 3% OFRESPONDENTS, TIED WITH RICK
SANTORUM, AND FALLING JUST SHORTOF "NO ONE" AT 4%, WHICH I SAY
HE CAN USE TO HIS ADVANTAGE.
JINDAL 2016:  NO ONE IS MOREPOPULAR!
(LAUGHTER)THIS MAN'S GOING ALL THE WAY.
BUT RECENTLY, JINDAL SET OUT TOCONVINCE PEOPLE HE'S A DOWN-HOME
GUY WHO'S LEARNED TO STOPLEARNING.
>> DO YOU PERSONALLY BELIEVE THETHEORY OF EVOLUTION EXPLAINS THE
PRESENCE OF COMPLEX LIFE ONEARTH?
>> LOOK, THE REALITY IS I WASNOT AN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST.
>> STEPHEN: YES, THE REALITYIS HE WAS NOT AN EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGIST.
HE JUST GRADUATED FROM BROWNUNIVERSITY WITH AN HONORS DEGREE
IN BIOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)BUT COME ON!
NOBODY USES THEIR COLLEGE DEGREEIN REAL LIFE.
I WENT TO DARTMOUTH BUT I DON'TUSE MY DEGREE IN -- "DIPLOMA
WITHHELD DUE TO OUTSTANDINGLIBRARY BOOK."
I CAN'T GET A JOB WITH THAT.TRUE STORY, BY THE WAY.
AND JINDAL KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKETO BE HANDICAPPED BY KNOWLEDGE,
SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE OTHERSDON'T HAVE TO SUFFER THE SAME
FATE.
>> I WANT MY KIDS TO BE TAUGHTABOUT EVOLUTION IN THEIR SCHOOL.
WHAT I BELIEVE AS A FATHER AND AHUSBAND IS THAT LOCAL SCHOOLS
SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS ON HOWTHEY TEACH.
I THINK LOCAL DISTRICTS SHOULDMAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD
BE TAUGHT IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.
>> STEPHEN: EXACTLY.
JINDAL BELIEVES EVOLUTION SHOULDBE ESTABLISHED SCIENCE ONLY ON A
"LOCAL" BASIS.
TAKE THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS.
ON ONE OF THEM, THE FINCHESEVOLVED LONGER BEAKS TO PUNCH
HOLES IN CACTUS FRUIT.
ON ANOTHER ISLAND, THE BEAKSWERE SHORTER BECAUSE JESUS.
AND JINDAL IS OFF TO ANIMPRESSIVE RETREAT FROM
KNOWLEDGE. BUT THERE'S A LOTMORE SCIENCE HE CAN RUN AWAY
FROM. FOR EXAMPLE, HE SHOULDINSIST THAT THUNDER IS JUST GOD
BOWLING, AND LIGHTNING IS GODGETTING HIS PICTURE TAKEN WITH
HIS BOWLING TROPHY. AND YES, IREALIZE THAT THE
LIGHTNING COMES BEFORE THETHUNDER, WHICH WOULD
MEAN GOD GOT HIS TROPHY JUSTBEFORE PLAYING HIS GAME.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY --GOD BOWLS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.
SO I APPLAUD BOBBY JINDAL FORDEFTLY FLOATING HIS PRESIDENTIAL
TRIAL BALLOON.
BUT DON'T CALL IT THAT, BECAUSETHE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON
BALLOONING YET.
I MEAN, IF HOT AIR RISES, HOWCOME HELL IS BELOW US?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
