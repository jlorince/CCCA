BUT FOLKS I SAY THE NAIL IN THE
COFFIN HERE IS THAT LIBERALS
LOVE THIS BILL.
EVEN "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST
IN AND LEAST INTERESTING VERSION
OF THE WORLD'S MOST INTERESTING
MAN, PAUL KRUGMAN WHO HAS
OPPOSED NEARLY EVERYTHING THE
PRESIDENT HAS DONE, CALLED THE
BILL SIGNIFICANTLY BOLDER AND
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
WRONG, SIR!
THIS THING WILL NOT WORK AND NO
ONE CAN TELL ME OTHERWISE.
HERE TO TELL ME OTHERWISE,
PLEASE WELCOME MY FIRST NOBEL
LAUREATE OF THE EVENING, PAUL
KRUGMAN.
PAUL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PAUL, I DO NOT... I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND, OKAY.
YOU ARE A NOBEL LAUREATE IN
ECONOMICS.
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THE
GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO ANYTHING.
>> IT CAN KILL PEOPLE.
WE'VE JUST SEEN THAT
DEMONSTRATED.
>> Stephen: YES, YES!
AND THEN THOSE PEOPLE DON'T NEED
JOBS.
CHECK MATE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S PERRY'S JOBS PLAN.
HOW DO YOU CREATE JOBS WITH
GOVERNMENT MONEY?
THOSE ARE TEMPORARY JOBS.
>> FIRST OF ALL, TEMPORARY JOBS
ARE SOMETHING WE REALLY KIND OF
NEED, RIGHT?
SUPPOSE THAT WE... THAT
CORPORATIONS BECAME MORE
COMPETENT AND DECIDED TO BORROW
SOME MONEY AND SPEND AND BILL
NEW PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> EVERYBODY THINKS THAT WOULD
CREATE JOBS, RIGHT?
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT GOES
OUT AND BUILDS BRIDGES AND
REPAIRS SCHOOLS AND PUTS PEOPLE
TO WORK IN HEALTH CARE AND THEN
HIRES MORE SCHOOL TEACHERS, WHY
IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT?
>> Stephen: BECAUSE OBAMA WILL
GET CREDIT.
(LAUGHTER)
THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO CREATE
JOBS, THE ONLY WAY TO CREATE
LASTING JOBS IS TO CUT TAXES FOR
BUSINESSES AND TO GET RID OF
REGULATION.
REGULATION IS STRANGLING JOBS.
THEN BUSINESSES WILL HAVE
CONFIDENCE AND THEY CAN PLAN FOR
THE FUTURE.
>> SO I HAVE... I I HAVE
INVENTED A CHARACTER.
SHE PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN A LOT OF
THESE DISCUSSIONS.
I CALL HER THE COMPETENCE FAIRY.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE RIGHT
WINGERS ARE ALWAYS SAYING,
THEY'RE GOING TO LAY OFF SCHOOL
TEACHERS, THEY'RE GOING TO SLASH
JOBS, THEY'RE GOING TO NOT BUILD
BRIDGES, THEY'RE GOING TO LET
THE BRYNS WE ALREADY HAVE FALL
DOWN BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE
CONFIDENCE FAIRY WILL COME IN
AND MAKE THE ECONOMY GROW.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
AND, IN FACT, LOOK....
>> Stephen: PAUL?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THERE MIGHT BE
CHILDREN WATCHING RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
THE CONFIDENCE FAIRY IS REAL,
ISN'T IT?
>> U, RIGHT, YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY THANK YOU.
>> BUT THE POINT IS IF YOU ASK
BUSINESSES PROUT PROMPTING THEM
OR HAVING A LOBBYIST SAYING THIS
IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY TO...
WHETHER REGULATION OR TAXES IS
THE PROBLEM, THEY BASICALLY
NEVER MENTION IT.
>> NOW, OKAY, YOU SAY THAT THE
CONFIDENCE FAIRY DOESN'T EXIST.
>> RIGHT.
OKAY, SO IF CONFIDENCE ISN'T A
PROBLEM WITH OUR ECONOMY, IS
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
>> NO....
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
THEN WILL YOU SAY RIGHT NOW...
WILL YOU SAY RIGHT NOW THAT WE
ARE HEADED INTO ANOTHER
DEPRESSION?
>> WE'RE ALREADY IN KIND OF A
DEPRESSION.
I CALL IT... I'M CALLING IT A
LESSER DEPRESSION.
THERE WAS THE GREAT DEPRESSION
OF THE 1930s....
>> Stephen: THAT HURTS TO HEAR
YOU SAY.
>> WE'RE ALREADY IN SOME THAT IS
FUNCTIONLY LIKE A DEPRESSION.
IT'S NOT AS BAD.
IT'S A LESSER DEPRESSION.
NOT THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
>> Stephen: SHOULD WE START
CREATING MUSICALS WHERE WOMEN
SWIM IN POOLS AND WE SHOULD HAVE
BLOND CURLEY HAIRED CHILDREN AND
AGED NEGROS.
SHOULD WE GO BACK TO THAT
HAPPIER TIME?
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, PAUL
KRUGMAN?
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
>> I THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WERE...
IPADS WERE BASICALLY THE
EQUIVALENT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S TRUE, THIS IS
REALLY BAD.
>> Stephen: DID YOU JUST CALL
IPADS AN AGED NEGRO?
(LAUGHTER)
I AM OFFENDED!
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND
ASK... HAVE A NOBEL LAUREATE
MAKE RACIST STATEMENTS ABOUT...
PLEASE GO!
>> I WAS SAYING STEVE JOBS IS
ESTHER WILLIAMS.
>> Stephen: STEVE JOBS IS ESTHER
WILLIAMS?
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO
POSSIBLY EDIT THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH PAUL KRUGMAN
OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
