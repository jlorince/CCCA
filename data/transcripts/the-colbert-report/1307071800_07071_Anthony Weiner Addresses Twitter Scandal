I'M TIVOING THE END OF THE
ECONOMY.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THE DEBT CEILING,
AND I DO, YOU KNOW WHO WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT THE DEBT
CEILING EVEN MORE?
NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY
WEINER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> TODAY I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE DEBT LIMITS.
>> LET ME MAKE A POINT
ABOUT-- THE DEBT LIMIT.
>> WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ARE THINGS
LIKE THE DEBT LIMIT.
>> Stephen: EVERYONE WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
BUT WEINER CAN'T TALK ABOUT
IT BECAUSE THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA KEEPS FOCUSING ON THIS
PICTURE THAT APPEARED ON HIS
TWITTER ACCOUNT.
FOLKS, I FEEL SORRY FOR THE
GUY.
HE'S A FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
AND THIS HAS GOT TO BE A BIG
WEIGHT ON HIS SHOULDERS, AND
JUDGING BY THIS PHOTO, HIS
LEFT THIGH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW WEINER HAS
TRIED HIS HARDEST TO GET
THIS STORY OUT OF THE NEWS
BY APPEARING ON EVERY NEWS
PROGRAM IN AMERICA,
EXPLAINING THAT HIS TWITTER
ACCOUNT WAS VICIOUSLY HACKED
IN A BLATANT CASE OF NAMISM.
>> WHEN YOUR NAME IS WEINER,
PEOPLE DO WEINER JOKES ABOUT
YOU ON THE INTERNET ALL THE
TIME.
THEY SENT A PICTURE THAT
MAKES FUN OF THE NAME
WEINER.
I GET IT TOUCHE,
DR. MORIARTY, YOU GOT ME.
>> Stephen: YES, TOUCHE,
DR. MORIARTY, WEINER SEES
THROUGH YOU LIKE SHERLOCK
HOLMES, OR IN THIS CASE,
JOHN HOLMES.
NOW I HOPE, FOLKS, I HOPE
WEINER IS MISTAKEN.
I HOPE THIS ISN'T SOME SORT
OF CHILDISH ATTACK JUST
BECAUSE OF HIS UNFORTUNATE
LAST NAME.
BECAUSE IF HE'S RIGHT, I
FEAR FOR THE TWITTER FEEDS
OF CONGRESSMAN JACK JOHNSON,
NORMAN DICK, BILLY LONG,
LEONARD LANCE, ELIJAH
CUMMINGS, TIMOTHY BISHOP, HE
BETTER HOPE THERE'S NO
PICTURES OF HIM POLISHING
ANYTHING.
AND I DO NOT WANT TO FIND
OUT WHAT A SHIMKISS IS AND I
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE
SEE-- CHAMBLIN.
AND HACKING--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND HACKING MAY
NOT BE THE ONLY CYBERCRIME
THAT WEINER IS A VICTIM OF.
>> HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A
PICTURE LIKE OF THIS
YOURSELF.
>> I CAN TELL YOU THIS.
THAT THERE ARE, I HAVE
PHOTOGRAPHS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
PHOTOGRAPHS ARE OUT THERE IN
THE WORLD OF ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THINGS
HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED AND
DOCK TORD.
PHOTOSES CAN CAN BE
MANIPULATED.
PHOTOS CAN BE OF ONE THING
CHANGED TO LOOK LIKE
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> Stephen: YES, PHOTOS CAN
BE CHANGED TO LOOK LIKE
SOMETHING ELSE.
WHAT?
THIS COULD BE A PENIS.
IT COULD ALSO BE A SUBMARINE
OR A BRIGHT WHITE-- GREAT
WHITE SHARK OR EVEN LADY
LIBERTY.
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE
ENDLESS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ALL IT TAKES IS
IMAGINATION AND THE GRAPHICS
DEPART THAT WON'T SUE YOU
FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
I MEAN THE MAN IS CLEARLY A
VICTIM AND YET CONGRESSMAN
WIEN CERTIFICATE TO THE
ASKING FOR ANY SPECIAL
TREATMENT.
>> AND I WANT TO MAKE IT
CLEAR.
THIS IS IN MY VIEW NOT A
FEDERAL CASE.
JUST BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO
CONGRESSMAN WEINER ON HIS
PERSONAL ACCOUNT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT THE TAXPAYERS
SHOULD PAY FOR SOME BIG
INVESTIGATION OF THIS THAT
WINDS UP GOING ON AND ON FOR
YEARS.
>> Stephen: I ADMIRE THE
FISCAL DISCIPLINE IT TAKES
TO RESIST LAUNCHING A
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF HIS
GROIN.
BUT FOLKS THERE IS SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT AT STAKE
HERE.
JUST LISTEN TO BILL
O'REILLY.
>> THE PENTAGON NOW SAYS
COMPUTER SABOTAGE COMING
FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY CAN
CONSTITUTE AN ACT OF WAR.
WE CANNOT STAND BY AND ALLOW
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO BE
ATTACKED BY CYBERCRIMINALS.
THE FBI SHOULD BE INVOLVED
IN THE WEINER STORY BECAUSE
NATIONAL SECURITY IS
INVOLVED.
>> Stephen: YES.
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL
SECURITY.
I MEAN THIS COULD BE THE
CHINESE.
WELL, MAYBE NOT THE CHINESE.
BUT-- YOU KNOW--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY OUT TO
HURT AMERICA.
AND I KNOW WHERE OF I SPEAK,
FOLKS BECAUSE I TOO HAVE
BEEN HACKED.
FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS
SOMEONE HAS BEEN POSTING
TROUBLING IMAGES ON MY
TWITTER FEED.
AND LIKE WEINER I CANNOT SAY
WITH CERTITUDE THAT THIS IS
NOT PART OF MY BODY.
OR THIS OR EVEN THIS.
I DEMAND A FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION.
I KNOW IT WILL BE EXTENSIVE
SO FORGET WHAT I SAID ABOUT
THE DEBT CEILING.
WE NEED TO BORROW WHATEVER
IT TAKES BECAUSE AMERICA
WILL NOT BE SAFE UNTIL WE
ARE ABLE TO CONNECT A FACE
AND A NAME TO THIS WEINER.
OH, HI, THAT WAS EASY.
YOU'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
