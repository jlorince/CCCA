FOOD STAMPS.
HE DIDN'T ASK ANYBODY HOWMUCH MONEY THEY HAD.

THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AS ISTATED IS ARE YOU HELPING
ONE GROUP BY HURTING NEVERGROUP.
AN A BIGGER GROUP.
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF JESSSUS GOING TO BE DOWN WITH
THAT.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
(LAUGHTER)JESUS WOULD NOT BE DOWN WITH
TAKING MY TAXES TO PAY FORFOOD STAMPS.
JESUS DIDN'T TAKE THE LOAFSAND FISHES FROM THE RICH.
HE CONJURED THEM OUT OF THINAIR.
HE WAS LIKE CHRIST ANGELMINDFRIED.
BESIDES SOME OF THE HELPLESSDESERVE EVEN LESS HELP.
>> SOME OF THE PEOPLEWITHOUT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO
EAT, IT'S THEIR FAULT THEYDON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT.
>> IF YOU ARE AN ALCOHOLICOR A HEROIN ADDICT OR DRUG
ADDICT AND YOU CAN'T HOLD AJOB, ALL RIGHT, AND YOU CAN
CAN CAN'T SUPPORT YOURCHILDREN, WHAT'S MY
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBLE TOTHEIR CHILDREN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT ISIT MY FAULT THAT THESE KID'S
PARENTS ARE DRUG ADDICTS?
MAYBE IF THE KIDS KEPT THEIRROOM CLEAN LIKE MOM ASKED

SOMETIMES I JUST TIE THEMONEY TO A SNAKE AND LET IT
SLITER TO THE KIDS, OKAY.
REMEMBER KIDS, YOU CAN TRUSTPEOPLE WHO HAND MONEY TO YOU
AND SAID DON'T TELL YOURPARENTS.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS SOME OF THE
POORS OUT THERE DO NOTDESERVE CHARITY, ESPECIALLY
THE HOMELESS.
I MEANS WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL.
I WAS HOMELESS FOR A CHILDIN COLLEGE UNTIL MY ROOMMATE
STOPPED HAVING SEX WITH HISGIRLFRIENDMENT LUCKILY FOX

90 BUCKS, 23,000 FOR A YEAR.
TAX-FREE.
>> 11 BUCKS AN HOUR.
I MEAN MAKE IT RAIN!
WHILE, OF COURSE, PRAYINGTHAT IT DOESN'T RAIN.
NOWS TO EL KNOWS WE MUSTRESIST OUR NATURAL URGE TO
HELP THESE BIG FAT FAKERS.

FOR MONEY ON THE STREETS, WESHOULD NOT GIVE THEM MONEY?
>> YES.
AND IT'S NOT I WHO AMSUGGESTING THAT, THE PEOPLE
WHO WORK WITH THE HOMELESSSAY DON'T GIVE THEM MONEY.
IT'S A BAD THING.
ARE YOU AN ENABLER, ARE YOUENABLING THEIR ALCOHOL OR
THEIR DRUG HABIT.
FAR BETTER, IF YOU REALLYTHINK THEY ARE FOREREAL AND
MOST ARE NOT TO TRY TO HELPTHEM GET TO ONE OF THE
SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES.
>> Stephen: I SAY DON'TTRUST ANYONE WHO ASKS FOR
CHANGES, ESPECIALLY THISGUY.
HE'S NOT HOMELESS.
I SAW HIM IN LIKE THREEFANCY DEPARTMENT STORES.
BUTS TO EL KNOWS THAT THEBIGGEST PROBLEM ISN'T THE
SCAMMERS, IT'S THE BLEEDINGHEARTS.
>> WHEN WE ASK GIVERS WHYTHEY GAVE, PEOPLE SAID
THINGS LIKE THIS.
>> THAT GUY LOOKED PRETTYNEEDY, I SUPPOSE.
>> IT IS COLD OUT, I'MPRETTY COLD MYSELF SO I'M
THINKING OF HIS SITUATION.
