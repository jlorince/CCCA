NOW, NATION, I THINK OF MYSELFAS AN OBJECTIVE OBSERVER BECAUSE
I OBJECT TO EVERYTHING IOBSERVE.
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT; WAG OF
THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF!
(LAUGHTER)NATION, IT'S LATE SEPTEMBER,
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO GEAR UPFOR THANKSGIVING.
I LOVE IT ALL: THE FOOD, THEFAMILY, THE LAUGHING, THE
DRINKING, THE "NO WONDER YOURWIFE LEFT YOU, MARGARET," THE
"THAT'S NOT THE PROPER WORD FORASIANS, NANA."
THE "EVERYBODY HELP CLEAN UP,MOM LOCKED HERSELF IN THE
LAUNDRY ROOM WITH A BOTTLE OFCHARDONNAY."
IT'S A SPECIAL TIME AND NOTHANKSGIVING IS COMPLETE WITHOUT
BUTTERBALL TURKEYS.
THEY'RE AN AMERICAN CLASSIC,JUST LIKE THAT PILGRIMS KEPT IN
DARK CAGES THEIR ENTIRE LIVES UPTO THEIR ANKLES IN THEIR OWN
FECES.
PASS ME ANOTHER DRUMSTICK.
AND THEIR LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTMADE ME EVEN MORE OF A
TRYPTOPHAN.
(LAUGHTER)>> THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK
LINE IS LOOKING FAR FEW GOODMEN.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TURKEYSELLER IS LOOKING TO HIRE MALE
OPERATORS TO HELP GIVE ADVICE TOANYONE TRYING TO MAKE THE
PERFECT TURKEY DURING THEHOLIDAYS.
FOR THE PAST 32 YEARS, ONLYWOMEN HAVE OFFERED ADVICE ON THE
BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK LINE.
>> Stephen: FINALLY MEN ON THETURKEY TALK LINE!
I MEAN --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME THE MENWERE ON THE TURKEY TALK LINE--
BESIDES THE ONES AT THE N.S.A.
(LAUGHTER)SO A BIG TIP OF THE HAT TO
BUTTERBALL FOR RECOGNIZING THATMEN HAVE THE RIGHT STUFFING.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, AS BUTTERBALL SAYS "MORE
AND MORE MEN ARE INVOLVED INTHANKSGIVING DINNER AND TODAY
ONE IN EVERY FOUR CALLS ARE FROMMEN."
BUTTERBALL KNOWS WHEN A GUYCALLS ANYONE, HE WANTS ANOTHER
MAN ON THE LINE!
(LAUGHTER)JUST LIKE PHONE SEX.
MEN KNOW WHAT MEN LIKE.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE MEN WILL GIVE MEN MANLY
COOKING TIPS LIKE "BUY TURKEY,LAY ON COUCH UNTIL SHARON SAYS
IT'S TIME TO CARVE THE BIRD,SERVE AND EAT, RETURN TO COUCH."
CLASSIC RECIPE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SO GOOD FOR YOU, BUTTERBALL, FOR
PUTTING SOME MAN GRAVY ON THISYEAR'S BIRD.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)THE BUTTERBALL IS GOOD,
BUTTERBALLS ARE BETTER.
(LAUGHTER)NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM
HYPERCOMPETITIVE AND IF YOUDON'T KNOW THAT BY NOW-- WELL,
THEN I GIVE UP.
(LAUGHTER)SO I AM GIVING A WAG OF THE
FINGER TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES"SCIENCE WRITER ASHLEY MERRYMAN
FOR AN OP-ED SHE WROTE LAST WEEKENTITLED "LOSING IS GOOD FOR
YOU."
WELL, IF YOU REALLY FEEL THATWAY, MS. MERRYMAN, GREAT NEWS, I
THINK YOU'RE A LOSER.
(LAUGHTER)MERRYMAN HERE CLAIMS AMERICA HAS
GONE TROPHY CRAZY, ESPECIALLYWHEN IT COMES TO OUR KIDS AND
THAT AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCHINGTHE EFFECTS OF PRAISE ON KIDS
"THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR: AWARDSCAN BE POWERFUL MOTIVATORS BUT
NON-STEP RECOGNITION DOES NOTINSPIRE CHILDREN TO SUCCEED,
INSTEAD IT CAN CAUSE THEM TOUNDERACHIEVE."
WRONG!
(LAUGHTER)WRONG!
THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT ONAWARDS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK GAVEWASHINGTON THE CONFIDENCE TO
DEFEAT THE BRITISH?
IT WAS HIS FOURTH GRADE MOSTIMPROVED KARATE PARTICIPATION
PROFY!
(LAUGHTER)LISTEN UP!
LISTEN UP, THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
YOU PUBLISHED SOME LIBERAL J.D.
ABOUT AWARDS BEING TERRIBLE ANDLOSING THE S THE BEST RIGHT
AFTER I WIN THESE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SKRAO +ED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CLEARLY, CLEARLY, CLEARLY
SOMEBODY IS JEALOUS.
BECAUSE WHILE I'VE BEEN SHOWEREDIN GOLD, THE ONLY GOLDEN SHOWER
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" GETS ISCONGRESS TEAL URINE.
(LAUGHTER)FINALLY, FOLKS, EVERYONE KNOWS
I'M CLOSE TO THE JESUS.
HE CARRIES ME ON THAT BEAT SOOFTEN HE GOT A BABY BJORN.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OFMY FINGER TO SCIENCE FOR
SLANDERING MY RELIGION.
>> THE INSTITUTE OF APPLIEDIMMUNOLOGY SHOWED ONE OF THE
WORST CONTAMINATED WATER SOURCESON THE PLANET IS IN CHURCHES.
86% OF HOLY WATER CONTAINS FECALMATTER.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY'RE
ALWAYS BURNING INCENSE.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
HOLY WATER WAS DANGEROUS.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENSWHEN YOU DRINK IT.
(LAUGHTER)(SCREAMING)
A MOMENT ON THE LIPS, ANETERNITY OF NOT HAVING LIPS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WHAT IF THERE'S FECAL
MATTER?
LISTEN TO THE SO-CALLEDSOLUTIONS.
>> THE RESEARCHERS SAY IF THECHURCHES WOULD JUST ADD SALT AND
REGULARLY CHANGE THE WATERPROBLEM COULD BE ELIMINATED.
>> Stephen: ADD SALT ANDCHANGE THE WATER?
WE'RE BLESSING OURSELVES, NOTMAKING LINGUINI.
(LAUGHTER)YOU DO NOTES ME WITH THE
ORIGINAL RECIPE.
IT WORKS.
TAKING THE FECAL MATTER OUT OFHOLY WATER WOULD BE LIKE TAKING
THE FECAL MATTER OUT OFCOCA-COLA.
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IN THERE,I'M JUST SAYING I'VE NEVER SEEN
THE RECIPE AND IT IS DARK BROWN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
