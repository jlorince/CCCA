>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
VERY KIND, VERY KIND.
FOLKS, I WOULD LIKE TO BE TO
TALK ABOUT TIPS AND WAGS BUT
THIS TIME IT IS NOT ABOUT
ANTHONY WEINER'S PENIS.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG
OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FIRST UP, NEWS
ABOUT THE RAID THAT KILLED
BIN LADEN JUST KEEPS GETTING
BETTER.
>> FROM ITS EARLIEST DAYS AL
QAEDA LEADERS INSISTED ON
RECEIPTS.
IF FIGHTERS WERE BUYING A
CAR FOR AN OPERATION OR EVEN
DISK DRIVES FOR COMPUTERS,
THEY WERE REQUIRED TO RETURN
WITH AN ACCOUNTING OF
EVERYTHING THEY'D SPENT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
BIN LADEN KEPT IMMACULATE
FINANCIAL RECORDS.
NO DOUBT USING OUR QUICKEN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SO TONIGHT I'M
GIVING A RARE TIP OF MY HAT
TO O BIN LADEN FOR-- OSAMA
BIN LADEN FOR NOT JUST BEING
AL QAEDAA-- AL QAEDA
CHARISMATIC LEADER BUT ALSO
THEIR ANNOYING GUY FROM
ACCOUNTING.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
AGO METHOD, YOU SKIPPED LINE
FOUR.
WAS THE GAS TO DRIVE THE CAR
OR BLOW IT UP.
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
SAY IT.
THEY'RE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS.
REMEMBER, CHALIL, REMEMBER
YOUR 72 VIRGINS DON'T CARRY
OVER TO THE NEXT FISCAL
YEAR.
USE THEM OR LOSE THEM.
AND--
(APPLAUSE)
I HAVE A FROG IN MY THROAT.
A FROG IN MY THROAT.
AND BIN LADEN WAS ALSO GREAT
IN THE HR DEPARTMENT.
LISTEN TO HIS MANAGEMENT
STYLE.
>> AS ODD AS IT SOUNDS AL
QAEDA HAD EXCELLENT HR
BENEFITS.
SEIZED DOCUMENTS SHOWS THAT
THE GROUP PAID ATTENTION TO
ITS FIGHTERS AND THEIR
FAMILIES.
MARRIED MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED
TO HAVE SEVEN DAYS OF
VACATION FOR EVERY THREE
WEEKS WORKED.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
AL QAEDA HAD BETTER BENEFITS
THAN WAL-MART.
ALTHOUGH AT WAL-MART, YOU
GET TO WEAR YOUR VEST MORE
THAN ONCE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WAL-MART.
THE WAL-MART.
BEST OF ALL, WE NOW HAVE ALL
OF AL QAEDA'S RECEIPTS ARE.
SO THE NEXT TIME WE SEIZE
BOMB MAKING EQUIPMENT WE CAN
RETURN IT FOR CASH.
OR, IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN
90 DAYS WE'LL TAKE STORE
CREDIT.
THE WAR ON TERROR IS GOING
TO PAY FOR ITSELF.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, YOU KNOW I
GET GREAT PLEASURE FROM THE
PLEASURE YOU GET WATCHING
ME.
I LIKE TO IMAGINE YOU HEROES
OUT THERE ADMIRING MY
FLAWLESS SKIN.
MY LUXURIOUS HAIR.
AND MY WASHBOARD FOREHEAD.
BUT TONIGHT I HAVE TO GIVE A
WAG OF MY FINGER TO HUGH
HEFFNER WHO RECENTLY TWEETED
THIS ON BEHALF OF HIS
SELL-- HIMSELF AND HIS
FIANCEE CRYSTAL HARRIS.
QUOTE WE'RE WATCHING THE
DAILY SHOW AND "THE COLBERT
REPORT."
THEN IT'S TIME TO SNUGGLE.
GOOD NIGHT ALL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HUGH HEFFNER IS WATCHING MY
SHOW AND THEN SNUGGLING.
FOLKS, WE ALL KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS BEFORE SNUGGLING.
CRYING.
BUT BEFORE THAT, IT'S SEX.
HUGH HEFFNER IS GETTING HIS
PIPE CLEANED DURING MY SHOW.
DON'T-- NO-- NO, NO
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: DON'T PICTURE IT,
BRAIN, DON'T PICTURE IT,
BRAIN.
NO, WAIT, TOO LATE.
I'M SEEING FLASHES OF SILK
HEATS, BODY BUTTER AND A
CALIFORNIA RAISEIN IN ASCOT.
JIMMY, TAKE DOWN MY
IMAGINATION.
TAKE DOWN MY IMAGINATION,
JIMMY.
THAT'S BETTER.
FOLKS, THIS IS BAD ON SO
MANY LEVELS.
FOR STARTERS IF SOMEONE
SHATTERS A HIP WHILE
WATCHING MY SHOW I'M
FINANCIALLY LIABLE.
SECOND, I KNOW ONE LOOK AT
MY FACE IS LIKE THROWING
BACK A DOZEN OYSTERS AND
THEN DOING A LINE OF POWDERED
RHINO HORN, BUT HEFF, YOU
HAVE GOT TO CONTROL
YOURSELF.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED YET.
SAVE YOURSELF FOR THE
HONEYMOON.
BESIDES I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS SEXY ABOUT THE DAILY
SHOW.
I ASSUME YOU ARE WATCHING IT
JUST SO YOU CAN LAST LONGER.
BUT FOLKS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT FOLKS I KNOW
OLD MEN ARE SET IN THEIR
ROUTINES WHICH MEANS HUGH
HEFFNER COULD BE DOING IT
RIGHT NOWS AS I SPEAK.
NO, NO, NO, BREAK TELEPHONE
UP, OLD MAN.
BAD HEFF.
DISMOUNT, DISMOUNT.
STOP IT!
SCRAM!
SCRAM!
BEAT IT, I MEAN DON'T BEAT
IT.
JUST STOP.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: .
>> Stephen: JIM, PUT UP
SOMETHING THAT IS GUARANTEED
TO TURN THEM OFF.
