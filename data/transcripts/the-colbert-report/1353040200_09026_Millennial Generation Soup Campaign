WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, I'M IN THE TV BIZ, WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DEMO GRAPHICS -- THE DEMO, WE CALL IT.
SO I WORK HARD TO APPEAL TO THE MILLENNIALS.
FOR EXAMPLE, BY CALLING THEM MILLENNIALS.
(  LAUGHTER  ) YOUNG PEOPLE LOVE BEING TARGET MARKETED BY THEIR BIRTHS DATE AND PURCHASING POWER, YOU KNOW,
GANGNAM STYLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT THEY EAT IT UP!
THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY I STAY UP ON ALL THE HOTTEST MILLENNIAL TRENDS.
AND RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NOTHING 18- TO 34-YEAR-OLD UPPER MIDDLE-INCOME KIDS LOVE MORE
THAN SOUP, PLAYAH!
YOU NEED PROOF?
WELL, LET ME SCHOOL YOU ON AMERICA'S HOTTEST LIQUID FOOD TREND, CAMPBELL'S GO, THE NEW
YOUTH-SCWUG LINE OF SUMES MADE ESPECIALLY FOR MILLENNIALS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
EVERY AMERICAN GENERATION IS DEFINED BY ONE THING-- THE GREATEST GENERATION STOPPED HITLER.
THE BABY BOOMERS STOPPED THE VIETNAM WAR.
AND THIS GENERATION WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY FOR DEMANDING DIFFERENT SOUP.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) ACCORDING-- ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY, CAMPBELL'S GO IS A NEW
LINE OF SUMES DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE LIKE US-- FUN, BUSY, YOUNGISH.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, I THINK THIS MARKETING CAMPAIGN IS GREAT-ISH.
NOW, I BET YOU'RE SAYING, HEY, THESE NEW CANS OF SOUP CAN'T GET AND MORE DOPE.
HAIL TO THE NAH BECAUSE THEY COME IN A BAG NOW, BIATCH!
YEAH!
( APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THAT GUY.
LOOK AT THAT GUY RIGHT THERE.
HE'S GOING, "WHAT UP, SOUP?"  ( LAUGHTER ) JAM A STRAW IN IT, OKAY.
IT'S LIKE CAPRI SOUP.
AND BECAUSE IT'S SO HIP, HOME SLICE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ADS ON THE TV.
NO, THAT'S FOR SQUARES.
YOU GOTTA SURF OVER TO THE GAMBLE'S GO WEB SITE EMY, TUMBLIR GRAPHICS THAT CAPTURE
THE SPIRIT AND ENERGY ONE ASSOCIATES WITH SOUP.
OF COURSE, YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING WHAT'S SOUP WITHOUT MUSIC?
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
(  LAUGHTER  ) WELL, THEY GOT THAT COVERED, TOO, BECAUSE CAMPBELL'S HAS PARTNER WITH THE MUSIC SERVICE
SPOTTIFY SO CONSUMERS CAN CREATE CUSTOM PLAYLISTS BUILT OFF THE PERSONA OF THE SOUP.
SOUP-INSPIRED PLAYLISTS!
IT'S LIKE A MIX TAPE YOU MAKE FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND, ONLY YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS A BAG OF SOUP.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOR EXAMPLE, I CHOSE TOM PETTY'S
"A WASTED LIFE "TO DESCRIBE WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THIS
