[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, PLEASE, WE HAVE TO...
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
VERY KIND.
AND IN RETURN, LET ME SAY,
DOS VIDANA.
NATION, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, I AM
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FAN OF
SPIDER-MAN.
WHAT'S THAT, NERDS?
YOU'RE A BIGGER FAN THAN I AM?
REALLY?
WELL THEN HERE'S A SPIDEY TRIVIA
QUESTION.
WHICH ISSUE HAD YOU ON THE
COVER?
I AM ON AMAZING SPIDER-MAN
NUMBER 573 SAVING THE WEBBED
CRUSADER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
PRETTY COOL.
WELL, I'M AFRAID I CANNOT SAVE
HIM THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THE
LATEST ISSUE OF MARVEL COMICS
ULTIMATE FALLOUT, PETER PARKER
IS KILLED, PRESUMABLY WHILE
APPEARING IN SPIDER-MAN: TURN
OFF THE DARK.
[LAUGHTER]
WORST, NOW THAT PETER PARKER IS
DEAD, THERE IS A NEW REPLACEMENT
SPIDER-MAN.
>> BILLING, BIG SHAKE-UP IN THE
SUPERHERO WORLD.
>> FORGET ABOUT PETER PARKER,
THE NEW SPIDER-MAN IS SWINGING
THROUGH THE PAGES OF MARVEL
COMICS, AND HIS NAME IS MILES
MORALES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> A TEENAGER WHO IS HALF BLACK,
HALF HISPANIC.
>> Stephen: HALF BLACK, HALF
HISPANIC?
WHAT SORT OF ORIGIN STORY DOES
HE HAVE?
WAS HE A BLACK GUY BITTEN BY A
RADIOACTIVE HISPANIC OR A
HISPANIC GUY BITTEN BY A
RADIOACTIVE BLACK GUY.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
PLUS HALF HISPANIC, ? HE'S
COMING HERE TO STEAL OUR
SUPERHERO JOB.
IT'S BAD ENOUGH WE HAVE AN
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CLAIMING TO
REPRESENT THE AMERICAN WAY.
GO BACK THE CAL RIPKEN ON THE,
KAL-EL.
WHAT'S NEXT?
A CHINESE HULK?
DON'T MARK -- MAKE ME ASIAN.
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME WHEN I'M
ASIAN.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY'LL GIVE
US A GAY BATMAN.
OKAY, A GAYER BATMAN.
[APPLAUSE]
