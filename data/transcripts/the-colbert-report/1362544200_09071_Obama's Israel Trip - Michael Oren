[LAUGHTER]
WILL OBAMA'S TRIP BE A SUCCESS?

ISRAELIS BY EATING THE PALESTINAN DELICACY FALAFEL?

>> Stephen: CHOSEN PEOPLE STILL CHOSEN?
>> CHOSEN PEOPLE FROM THE BIBLE.
THOSE ARE THE JEWS.
WE'RE THE CHOSEN ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES, THE ULTIMATE ALLY IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.

SUPPORT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL IS A TRY BIPARTISAN ISSUE.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT HAGGLE.

[LAUGHTER]
>> FIRST OF ALL SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAGUE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF ISRAEL.
HE HAS TOTAL SUPPORT FOR OUR SECURITY AND THE ALIANCE.

>> WE'RE RIGHT THERE A SMALL COUNTRY IN IRAN'S BACKYARD AND THE IRANIAN LEADERS ARE
THREATENING TOLL WIPE US OFF THE MAP.
>> Stephen: OBAMA HAS NOT SAID HE WILL RAIN HELLFIRE ON IRAN.
>> HE HE HAS SAID HE IS KEEPING ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS IS A MILITARY
OPTION AND NONE OF THOSE IS CONTAINMENT WITH AN IRANIAN NUCLEAR WEAPON.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO YOU TELL NETANYAHU WHEN YOU BACK THERE THAT THE COLBERT NATION IS

NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS YOU ADMIT TO HAVING.
