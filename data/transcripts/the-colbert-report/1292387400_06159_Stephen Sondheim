MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY
BROADWAY COMPOSER, WHICH I

PEOPLE SAY, A LIVING LEGEND.

THE AMERICAN THEATER OVER THE
LAST 50 YEARS, AND LET'S EDUCATE
THE PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT TO THE
CALIBRE OF MAN I'M SITTING
ACROSS FROM.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WOW.
THAT'S JUST... THAT'S JUST A
SMATTERING OF WHAT YOU HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED IN YOUR CAREER, AND
THIS BOOK YOU'VE GOT NOW,
STEPHEN SONDHEIM'S FINISHING THE
HAT, COLLECTED LYRICS 1954 TO
1981, IT DOESN'T EVEN HIT THINGS
LIKE "SONNY IN THE PARK WITH
GEORGE."
>> THAT COMES LATER, SECOND
VOLUME.
>> Stephen: WHY HAIR CYST?
DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A
BOLT?
>> NO, I THINK OF MYSELF AS A
LYRICIST?
>> Stephen: WHAT IS A LYRICIST
EXCEPT A POET WITH THE
POSSIBILITY OF MAKING CASH?
>> IT'S A GUY WHO CAN SING.
IT'S A GUY WHO FEELS MUSIC.
THAT'S ALLMENT YOU WRITE LYRICS
BECAUSE THERE'S MUSIC IN YOUR
HEAD AND MUSIC GOES WITH THE
LYRICS.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE WORD FLY.
>> Stephen: WHO TAUGHT YOU
WHAT YOU KNOW?
EVERYBODY NEEDS Açó MENTIONER?
>> OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN.
WHEN I WAS 11 YEARS OLD, MY
PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.
I FELL IN WITH THE HAMMERSTEIN
FAMILY AND BECAME A SURE GOT SON
TO OSCAR.
WHEN I WAS 15 HE TAUGHT ME
ALMOST EVERYTHING IN ONE
AFTERNOON.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEP, YEP.
I GAVE HIM A SHOW I'D WRITTEN
FOR SCHOOL.
AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD PRODUCE
IT ON BROADWAY.
I'D BE THE FIRST 15-YEAR-OLD.
>> Stephen: AT 15.
CONFIDENCE.
THAT'S NICE.
>> AND HE SAID, WELL, YOU GOT TO
PRETEND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ME,
I JUST CROSSED YOUR DESK.
HE SAID, "IN THAT CASE, IT'S THE
WORST THING I EVER READ."
HE STARTED TO TREMBLE A LITTLE.
HE SAID, IT'S NOT UNTALENTED,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG
WITH IT.
HE WENT THROUGH IT LINE BY LINE.
HE TREATED ME LIKE AN ADULT.
HE TOOK FIRST STAGE DIRECTION,
WHY DOES THIS CHARACTER SEE
THIS?
WHY DOES SHE DROP OUT?
I DON'T SEE HER AGAIN.
HE TREATED ME SERIOUSLY.
>> Stephen: WAS THAT PAINFUL
AT ALL?
>> NOT REALLY.
WHEN YOU'RE A SPONGE WHEN YOU
ARE...
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I DON'T
TAKE CRITICISM VERY WELL AT ALL.
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S
MUCH TO CRITICIZE WITH YOU, IS
THERE?
>> Stephen: GOD BLESS YOU.
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, YOU ALSO... NOW, ALL OF
THESE MUSICALS THAT YOU WROTE,
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY DISNEY
ANIMATIONS, CORRECT?
>> WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
AM I GOING TO FIND ANY RHYMES,
FOR INSTANCE, THAT YOU REGRET?
IF YOU COULD TAKE BACK A RHYME,
BECAUSE I ONCE WROTE A SONG
ABOUT THE BALKAN CRISIS, HONEST
TO GOD, AND I REMIND
DICTATORSHIP WITH POTATO CHIP.
>> CLOSE, CLOSE.
NO CIGAR.
>> Stephen: I'M PROUD OF THAT.
BUT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD
LIKE TO TAKE BACK?
>> NO.
ONCE YOU HAVE A MOVIE ACTRESS
NAMED CLAUDETTE COLBERT.
I USED HER IN A SONG AND I
REMIND IT.
>> Stephen: YOU REMIND
COLBERT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE RHYME?
>> SHE CAME TO A PARTY AND SHE
LATER SAW COLBERT.
>> Stephen: I FEEL LIKE THAT'S
ACTED ME.
"WEST SIDE STORY," YOU WERE THE
LYRICIST FOR "WEST SIDE STORY."
YOU WERE STILL A YOUNG GUY AT
THAT TIME.
>> 25.
>> Stephen: 25 YEARS OLD.
CAN I TAKE ISSUE WITH SOME OF
YOUR LYRICS?
>> YOU CERTAINLY CAN.
>> Stephen: "THERE'S A PLACE
FOR US."
THAT'S TONY AND MARIA.
IS THERE REALLY A PLACE FOR THEM
BECAUSE MARIA IS AN ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANT FROM PUERTO RICO.
THIS IS WHY WE NEED A BORDER
WALL.
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HER.
>> THE WAY IT WAS IN THE SHOW,
IT LOOKED LIKE NEW JERSEY.
THE KIDS HAD THIS BALLET IN THE
SECOND ACT AND THEY ESCAPE FROM
THE HORRORS OF MANHATTAN.
THE WAY THE SET LOOKED, IT WAS
NEW JERSEY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
THE HORRORS OF NEW JERSEY?
>> THAT KIND OF YELLOW SMOKE.
>> Stephen: MAYBE YOUR BIGGEST
TOE-TAPPER OUT THERE, THE ONE
PEOPLE KNOW THE BEST IS "SEND IN
THE CLOWNS."
>> VERY SLOW TAP.
IT'S FROM "A LITTLE NIGHT
MUSIC."
>> Stephen: WHERE WERE THE
CLOWNS?
WHERE ARE THE CLOWNS?
WE NEVER FIND OUT WHERE THE
CLOWNS WERE, AND IT REALLY
LEAVES THE AUDIENCE HANGING.
>> SHE'S A LOST LADY.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
EITHER.
>> Stephen: I FOUND WHERE THEY
ARE.
I'VE GOT SOME LYRICS.
I COULD PERHAPS FINISH YOUR
SONG.
>> YOU.
CAN
♪ WHERE ARE THE CLOWNS
I BOOKED THEM FOR A
♪ MET THEM ON THE PHONE SAYING
THEY'RE LATE
♪ TRAFFIC WAS BAD
THE TUNNEL'S A MESS
♪ 12 OF THEM CAME IN ONE CAR
THEY LOST MY ADDRESS
♪ YOU JUST CAN'T TRUST CLOWNS
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED CLOWNS
♪♪
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO MUCH
MORE SATISFYING, ISN'T IT?
ISN'T THAT SATISFYING TO KNOW
WHERE THE CLOWNS ARE?
>> WELL, WE HAVE THREE WEEKS
LEFT OF THE SHOW ON BROADWAY
BEFORE IT CLOSES IN JANUARY.
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY
BERNADETTE PETERS CAN'T SING
THAT.
>>
>> Stephen: I'M TOTALLY READY
TO PITCH THAT.
>> WE NEED SOME LAUGHS IN THE
SECOND HALF.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO
HAVE MORE?
>> THE SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE
CALLED "LOOK I HAVE HAT."
>> Stephen: I'M SO HAPPY YOU
CAME HERE.
YOU AND ME, BUD, WE'RE THE
LOONIES.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
STEPHEN SONDHEIM, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
