ENDING.
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU HAD A GREAT
WEEKEND.
I DID.
I SPENT IT AT THE BIG ANNUAL
N.R.A. MEETING IN HOUSTON,
TEXAS.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YES, THE ANNUAL N.R.A. MEETING
IN HOUSTON TEXAS NOT TO BE
CONFUSED WITH THE DAILY N.R.A.
MEETING THAT IS HOUSTON, TEXAS.
AND THIS YEAR'S THEME WAS
ACCESSORIES.
LIKE PINK ASSAULT RIFLES AND BRA
HOLSTERS.
NOW, FELLOWS CAN BRAG ABOUT
GETTING TO SECOND AMENDMENT.
ONE THING I HER REPEATEDLY DOWN
THERE THIS WEEKEND IS THAT OBAMA
IS COMING FOR OUR GUNS.
NOW I'M NOT ONE TO BELIEVE IN
FAROUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT
IMPLANTED A CHIP IN MY BRAIN
THAT CONTROLS MY THOUGHTS.
BUT, FOLKS, I'VE HAD MY EYES
OPENED TO SOME DISTURBING TRUTHS
THAT RAISE TROUBLING QUESTIONS
LIKE, "WHAT DID THEY KNOW?
WHEN DID THEY KNOW IT?
AND WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEW
SEGMENT EXPOSING VAST GOVERNMENT
CONSPIRACIES, STEPHEN COLBERT'S
BAT [BLEEP] SERIOUS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, FOLKS, I'VE WANTED TO DO
THIS SEGMENT FOR A LONG TIME.
BUT I HAVEN'T.
WHY NOT?
WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT NEXT TIME.
BUT TONIGHT'S TOPIC: ARE THEY
COMING AFTER OUR GUNS?
NO.
THEY'RE COMING AFTER OUR
BULLETS.
>> WHY IS THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY USING ROUGHLY
A THOUSAND ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION
MORE PER PERSON THAN THE U.S.
ARMY?
>> YOU HAVE A HOMELAND SECURITY
DEPARTMENT THAT'S STOCK PILING
AMMUNITION AND KIND OF NOT
TELLING US WHY.
WE DON'T TRUST THEM.
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY IS PURCHASING 1.6
BILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION.
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY DID BUY 1.6 BILLION
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION.
>> Stephen: 1.6 BILLION ROUNDS?
WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO DO?
FILM A QUINTIN TARANTINO MOVIE?
NATION, FOLLOW ME DOWN THE
RABBIT HOLE.
IF IT EVEN IS A RABBIT AND NOT A
GROUND HOG IN A COSTUME.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S
SUSPICIOUS AMMO HOARDING WAS
FIRST NOTICED BY VIGILANT ONLINE
CONSPIRACY FORUMS BEFORE IT WAS
PICKED UP BY CONSERVATIVE RADIO
HOSTS AND THEN EVENTUALLY MADE
ITS WAY OUT TO THE FARTHEST
FRINGE ELEMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY,
CONGRESS.
JIM?
>> 360,000.
THAT'S HOW MANY ROUNDS OF
HOLLOW-POINT AMMUNITION THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
PLANS TO BUY.
IT'S ALREADY BOUGHT MORE THAN
TWO BILLION.
CONGRESS DEMANDING ANSWERS AS TO
WHY THEY NEED ALL THOSE BULLETS.
CAN SOMEONE ANSWER, PLEASE?
HELLO!
>> Stephen: PLEASE?
HELLO?
WHO'S THERE?
DOLORES?
GET ME KLONDIKE 6-4,000.
THIS ISN'T EVEN ATTACHED TO
ANYTHING.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
NOW, FOLKS, LEADING...
LEADING... LEADING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
LEADING THE CONGRESSIONAL CHARGE
IS SENATOR JAMES INHOFE, IF THIS
IS JAMES INHOFE AND NOT A GROUND
HOG IN A COSTUME.
SENATOR GROUND-HOFE HERE
RECENTLY INTRODUCED A BILL THAT
WOULD BAN FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM
BUYING MORE AMMUNITION IF IT
CURRENTLY POSSESSES MORE THAN
ITS MONTHLY AVERAGES DURING THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
YES, NOT INCLUDING THE AMMO THAT
ENDED UP IN THE FACES OF THE
FRIENDS OF DICK CHENEY.
FOLKS, I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S A
SAD STORY.
ISN'T IT?
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S SO SAD.
HE WAS FINE.
FOLKS, SENATOR INHOG'S BILL
COULDN'T HAVE COME AT A BETTER
TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY
DISTURBING THEORIES AS TO WHY
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS ALL THAT
AMMO.
>> SOME PREDICT A GOVERNMENT
ARMS RACE AGAINST AMERICANS.
>> I SUSPECT THAT JUST IN CASE
OUR FISCAL SITUATION, OUR
MONETARY SITUATION COLLAPSES,
AND FOLLOWING IT THE CIVIL
SOCIETY COLLAPSES, THAT IS THE
RULE OF LAW, THAT THEY WANT TO
BE PREPAREDDED.
THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.
>> Stephen: YES.
THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.
I MEAN, THE GOVERNMENT IS BUYING
UP AMMO SO THAT FOLLOWING THE
ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, THEY CAN
OUTGUN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND THEY NEED IT BECAUSE RIGHT
NOW ALL THEY'VE GOT AREÃ±r TANKS,
AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, PREDATOR
DRONES, NUCLEAR MISSILES, AND
LASER CANNONS.
BUT IF I GET MY HAND ON A BOX OF
SHOTGUN SHELLS, IT IS GO TIME,
UNCLE FATTY.
OH, AND THERE'S ONLY OTHER ONLY
ONE EXPLANATION FOR THE
GOVERNMENT BUYING ALL THIS AMMO.
>> SUB TER FUSION.
THE REGIME IS BUYING UP ALL
THE AMMO SO THAT THE GUNS THAT
YOU DO HAVE ARE USELESS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
IF OBAMA CAN'T TAKE OUR GUNS,
HE'LL MAKE SURE YOU CAN'T PUT
ANYTHING IN THEM.
AFTER THAT, HE'S GOING TO COME
AFTER RUSH BY BUYING UP ALL THE
HOOKERS AND CANNED FROSTING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, FOLKS, A LOT OF NEWS
OUTLETS INCLUDING FOX NEWS SAY
THAT THEY HAVE DEBUNKED THE
BULLET CONSPIRACY THEORY, BUT I
SAY IT'S ALREADY STARTED.
BECAUSE OUT OF FEAR OF
GOVERNMENT HOARDING, AMMO SALES
HAVE SKYROCKETED MAKING IT
HARDER TO FIND AMMO WHICH CAN
ONLY MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
HOARDING IT WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
TO BUY MORE AMMO BEFORE THE
GOVERNMENT GETS IT ALL BUT
THERE'S NONE LEFT BECAUSE WE
BOUGHT IT.
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S TOO LATE.
THE FEDS ALREADY HAVE US
OUTGUNNED.
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
ME ALIVE.
[BLEEP] I'M OUT OF AMMO.
I'M STILL ALIVE AND RICH AND
HAPPY.
YOU WIN THIS ROUND, OBAMA.
IF THAT IS YOU.
OH, MY GOD.
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT'S
BAT [BLEEP] SERIOUS.
JOIN ME NEXT TIME WHEN I ASK THE
QUESTION, DID BIG FOOT HELP LEE
HARVEY OSWALD BUILD STONE HENGE?
WE'LL BE RIGHT
