BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, NATION,
TODAY WAS DAY TWO OF ELENA
KAGAN'S SUPREME COURT
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, AND I
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I
COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S LIKE WATCHING SENATORS DRY.
BUT YESTERDAY WE GOT A STARK
REMINDER OF WHY KAGAN'S
NOMINATION IS SO IMPORTANT.
IN 5-4 VOTE, THE SUPREME COURT
STRUCK DOWN CHICAGO'S 30-YEAR
BAN ON HANDGUNS.
WOOOO!
WE DID IT.
♪♪
[GUNFIRE]
JIMMY, RELEASE THE BALLOONS.
[LAUGHTER]
JIMMY, NEXT TIME LET'S DROP THE
BALLOONS AND THEN I'LL SHOOT IN
THE AIR.
>> GOT IT.
>> Stephen: A CHOKING HAZARD.
FOLKS, THIS DECISION IS CRUCIAL
BECAUSE KAGAN IS RABIDLY
ANTI-GUN.
IN FACT, IN 1987 IN A SIMILAR
CASE OVER WASHINGTON, D.C.,'S
GUN BAN, KAGAN WROTE THAT SHE
WAS NOT SYMPATHETIC TO GUN
OWNERS.
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, SHE'S GOING
TO TAKE AWAY OUR ASSAULT RIFLES
AND USE THEM AS SOFTBALL BATS.
THAT'S WHY TO PROTECT THE SECOND
MENTAL, PRESIDENT OBAMA, I
DEMAND YOU WITHDRAW KAGAN'S
NOMINATION.
LET'S CUT OUT THE MIDDLEMAN AND
NOM MATE MY GUN "SWEETNESS" TO
BE THE NEXT JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
SWEETNESS WILL SAIL THROUGH
CONFIRMATION.
SHE'S A FEMALE AND SHE'S BLACK.
[LAUGHTER]
THE BEST PART, ALL HER DECISIONS
