(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
NATION, NATION THE NEWSRIGHT NOW, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THE NEWS RIGHT NOW IS A
LITTLE DEPRESSING, BUT WHENTIMES ARE TOUGH, AMERICA'S SMALL
TOWNS SHOW US HOW FOLKS MAKE DOWITH WHAT THEY'VE GOT.
THIS IS HOMETOWN HEROTOWN.
(TRUMPET SOUND)TONIGHT'S TINY TOWN THAT
COULD -- DETROIT.
MOTOWN HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMESLATELY --
RIGHT NOW, DETROIT IS MIRED INTHE LARGEST MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
THE CITY MANAGER ESTIMATES THETOTAL DEBT IS LIKELY TO BE
BETWEEN $18 BILLION AND$20 BILLION.
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT FIGURE ISA LITTLE VAGUE, BUT THE
REPO-MEN TOOK THE CITY'SCALCULATOR.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THEGOING GETS TOUGH,
THE HOMETOWN GETS HERO, ANDNOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN
DETROIT'S FIRE DEPARTMENT WHICH,CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, DOES
NOT START FIRES.
(LAUGHTER)THESE HARD WORKING
MIDDLE-AMERICANS TURNED THEIRLACK-OF-LEMONS INTO A
LACK-OF-LEMONADE.
JIM?
>> DETROIT GETS ABOUT 11,000FIRES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.
BUT HOW IT GETS THOSE CALLS MAYSURPRISE YOU.
THE CITY HAS NO MODERN-DAYCOMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR GETTING
EMERGENCY ALERT.
IN FIRE STATIONS ALL ACROSSDETROIT, FIREFIGHTERS PLACE A
POP CAN FILLED WITH COINS ORSCREWS ON TOP OF A FAX MACHINE.
WHEN AN EMERGENCY ALERT COMESTHROUGH, THE PAPER KNOCKS DOWN
THE POP CAN, THE CLANKING NOISEMEANS THERE'S AN EMERGENCY.
>> WHEN A RUN COMES OVER THEPRINTER, IT COMES OUT, HITS OUR
FAYGO CAN.
(CLANKS)AND WE GET AN ALERT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THEALARM AT MANY -- YES, GIVE IT
UP! GIVE IT UP!
(APPLAUSE)CAN DO!
THAT'S RIGHT, THEALARM AT MANY DETROIT FIRE
STATIONS IS A FAYGO CAN FULL OFSCREWS -- WHICH IS,
INCIDENTALLY, THE HEALTHIESTFLAVOR OF FAYGO.
(LAUGHTER)WELL DONE, THRIFTY DETROIT
FIREFIGHTERS, FOR SHOWING YOUDON'T NEED THE BELLS AND
WHISTLES OF ACTUAL BELLS ORWHISTLES.
(LAUGHTER)THIS WOBBLY CAN SYSTEM IS
FOOLPROOF, PROVIDED NO ONE EVERBUMPS THE TABLE.
AND THIS SECURITY INNOVATION ISNO SURPRISE.
AFTER ALL, DETROIT IS THE TOWNTHAT BROUGHT US ROBO COP, WHICH,
WITH TODAY'S BUDGET, LOOKS MORELIKE THIS.
>> DEAD OR ALIVE, YOU'RE COMINGWITH ME!
DROP IT!
>> Stephen: FOLKS, WHEN I SEETHIS JERRY-RIGGED ALARM SYSTEM,
IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE BRAVE MENAND WOMEN DESERVE MORE...
CHANCES TO MAKE DO WITH LESS.
I MEAN, THERE'S STILL PLENTY OFFAT TO BE TRIMMED HERE.
FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW EMERGENCYCALLS GO TO A CENTRAL DISPATCHER
WHO THEN FAXES IT TO THE FIRESTATIONS.
WHY BOTHER WITH DISPATCHERSWHEN HOMEOWNERS CAN FAX THE
STATION DIRECTLY?
IF THERE'S A FIRE, JUST REMEMBERTHE OLD SAYING -- STOP, DROP AND
ROLL -- OVER TO YOUR CANONL.C. 2050 LASER-CLASS FAX
MACHINE, THEN LOAD THEPAPER TRAY, PLACE YOUR DOCUMENT
TEXT-SIDE DOWN INTO THE FEEDER,DIAL YOUR LOCAL FIRE STATION AND
HIT "SEND."
OH!
AND MAKE SURE YOU ADD A COVERLETTER WITH THE SUBJECT HEADER
"FIRE!"(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)SO BRAVO, BRAVO TO DETROIT'S
FIREFIGHTERS WHO SOLVED THEIRLACK OF AN ALARM WITH THEIR
CAN-DO SPIRIT -- BY SAYING"LET'S HAVE A CAN-DO IT."
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
