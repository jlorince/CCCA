EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WROTE A BOOK
ABOUT GOING A YEAR WITHOUT SEX.
I ASSUME SHE SAID, "NOT TONIGHT,
DEAR, I HAVE A BOOK DEAL."
PLEASE WELCOME HEPHZIBAH
ANDERSON.
HI, MS. ANDERSON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A BIT OF A PROVOCATIVE
BOOK, A PROVOCATIVE TITLE HERE.
IT'S CALLED "CHASTENED: THE
UNEXPECTED STORY OF MY YEAR
WITHOUT SEX."
DID YOU EXPECT TO HAVE SEX AND
YOU WERE SURPRISED THAT YOU
DIDN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE SO
TRACKTIVE, OR WHAT WAS
UNEXPECTED ABOUT IT?
>> WHAT WAS UNEXPECTED WAS THAT
LIKE A DRY SPELL, I FOUND IT WAS
A VERY RICH YEAR OF
SELF-DISCOVERY, DISCOVERING WHAT
I WANTED FROM SEX, FIGURING OUT
HOW MUCH PRESSURE WAS PUT ON,
ESPECIALLY AS WOMEN, BUT, YOU
KNOW, MEN, TOO, TO HAVE SEX IN A
VERY CERTAIN, VERY RESTRICTED
WAY.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY,
ABSOLUTELY.
>> NOT A DRY SPELL AT ALL.
>> Stephen: EYE CONTACT,
LIGHTS ON.
VERY RESTRICTED.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, I WAS HERE IN NEW YORK
CITY.
AND I HAPPENED TO GLIMPSE MY OLD
COLLEGE GIRLFRIEND ESCORTING A
SMALL BLONDE FIANCEE INTO A
DIAMOND STORE.
THEY WERE BUYING AN ENGAGEMENT
RING.
I WAS ABOUT TO TURN 30.
IT GOT ME THINKING BACK OVER THE
RELATIONSHIP.
>> Stephen: YOU CRACKED.
>> I REALIZED THAT NO MAN HAD
SAID TO ME I LOVE YOU IN ALMOST
TEN YEARS, AND THAT BROUGHT INTO
FOCUS A LOT OF EMOTIONAL
FRUSTRATION I'D BEEN FEELING
THANKS TO THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IN
MY 20s.
>> Stephen: THIS ENGAGEMENT
THING RAISES A NICE POINT.
ARE YOU MARRIED?
>> I AM NOT MARRIED.
>> Stephen: WHY ISN'T THE BOOK
NOT CALLED "THE UNEXPECTED STORY
OF MY 32 YEARS WITHOUT SEX."
SHOULDN'T IT BE ABSTINENCE, WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE MARRIED?
>> I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE.
WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS RECLAIM
THE IDEA OF FIGURING OUT WHAT
YOU WANT FROM SEX AND HOLDING
OFF A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL YOU...
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM SEX?
IT'S LIKE SAYING WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM FOOD?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU WANT FOOD FROM FOOD.
>> WELL, YOU WANT NOURISHMENT.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WANT SEX FROM SEX.
>> YOU WANT SOME EMOTIONAL FOUR
EARNMENT, AS WELL.
>> Stephen: NOT NECESSARILY.
MEN DON'T ALWAYS WANT EMOTIONAL
NOURISHMENT.
WOMEN DO.
>> WOMEN GENERALLY, DO BUT I
THINK GUYS DO, AS WELL.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING
WOMEN WANT DIFFERENT THINGS.
>> I DO.
>>
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENT THING WOMEN WANT?
>> I THINK WOMEN NEED SOME KIND
OF EMOTIONAL...
>> Stephen: BUSTED.
EMOTIONAL.
DO YOU THINK MEN PUT PRESSURE ON
WOMEN TO HAVE SEX WITHOUT
EMOTION?
>> I DO.
BUT I THINK WOMEN PUT PRESSURE
ON OURSELVES.
WE HAVE THIS IDEA.
>> Stephen: ALL THE PRESSURE
GOES ON YOU GUYS?
WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURE WOMEN
PUT ON MEN TO HAVE EMOTIONS
WITHOUT SEX?
[LAUGHTER]
MAYBE WE DON'T FEEL LIKE HAVING
EMOTIONS TONIGHT, HONEY.
I DON'T HAVE HEART TONIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK WE'VE FORGOTTEN IT'S
OUR RIGHT TO DO THAT.
I'M ALL FOR WOMEN DOING THAT.
BUT I DON'T THINK WE THIS THAT
ANYMORE.
I THINK WE FEEL LIKE WE DON'T
HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen: SO WAS THIS HARD
TO DO?
>> YES, IT WAS.
FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS, NOT
ONLY THE OBVIOUS ONES, BUT THERE
WAS A LOT OF TEMPTATION, MUCH
MORE MALE INTEREST THAT YEAR
THAN ANY YEAR BEFORE.
>> Stephen: HARD TO GET.
HARD TO GET.
DID THEY KNOW?
DID YOU HAVE NAME TAG THAT SAID,
"HI, MY NAME IS HEPHZIBAH AND NO
THANK YOU?"
LOOK BUT NO TOUCHY.
>> THEY DIDN'T ALWAYS KNOW, BUT
THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW
SOMEBODY QUITE WELL IN ORDER TO
TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
SLEEP WITH THEM.
YOU DON'T SAY IT ON DATE ONE
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY
PRESUMPTUOUS.
DATE THREE, DATE SIX, DATE TEN,
WHATEVER YOU FEEL IS THE NATURAL
NUMBER.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.
THAT CAN BE MUCH MORE REVEALING.
YOU HAVE TO DO AN EMOTIONAL
STRIPTEASE.
PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY DO THAT
WHEN THEY STRIP DOWN.
>> Stephen: AN EMOTIONAL
STRIPTEASE TO TELL SOMEONE YOU
DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX MANY
>> YOU HAVE TO SAY, HERE'S WHAT
I WANT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.
>> IF YOU DIDN'T WANT SEX AT ALL
YOU WOULDN'T BE THERE.
BUT YOU WANT TO SAYING, I WANT
THIS TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN
JUST SEX TONIGHT BECAUSE IT
HAPPENS TO BE DATE THREE OR DATE
SIX AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S A
CERTAIN COCKTAIL OF TIME AND
PLACE.
>> Stephen: WE'RE TALKING NO
SEX, RIGHT?
NO SEX LIKE NO PHYSICAL CONTACT,
MAYBE A LITTLE THUMB WRESTLING
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT, RIGHT?
DID YOU DO ANYTHING?
WHAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF SEX?
>> MY DEFINITION OF SEX WAS VERY
LAST BASE.
>> Stephen: VERY LAST BASE?
LAST BASE LIKE WE CALL THAT HOME
PLATE IN AMERICA.
THAT'S ALL THE WAY.
SO YOU WOULD GO FIRST, SECOND
AND THIRD?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I BET YOU WERE
LEADING OFF THE BAG TOWARDS HOME
AT THIS POINT.
WELL, WELL, THAT'S MY UNEXPECTED
STORY OF MY YEAR WITH NOT
WORRYING ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT
I THINK.
HEPHZIBAH ANDERSON, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: THE BOOK IS
