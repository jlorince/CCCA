RESPONSIBLY.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
FOLKS, IT SEEMS THESE DAYS
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT SUPER
PAC WHICH, THANKS TO THE SUPREME
COURT'S CITIZENS UNITED RULING,
CAN COLLECT AND SPEND UNLIMITED
MONEY ON POLITICAL ADVERTISING.
AND WHEN OTHER PEOPLE COVER THE
SUPER PAC STORY THAT OFFENDS ME.
BECAUSE I HAVE OWNED THIS STORY
SINCE LAST JUNE WHEN I FORMED
COLBERT SUPER PAC WITH ONE
SIMPLE YET NOBLE GOAL: TO RAISE
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY.
AND I DID IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, NOW IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYBODY'S RIDING MY
WALLET-TAILS.
AT LAST COUNT, MORE THAN 320
SUPER PACS HAVE REGISTERED WITH
THE F.E.C.
IT'S NO SURPRISE THEY'RE COPYING
ME, FOLKS, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A
TRENDSETTER, EVER SINCE I
SINGLE-HANDEDLY POPULARIZED THE
BELL BOTTOM CROTCH.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S 'EM DROP.
KEEPS 'EM WARM WHEN THEY'RE
SWINGING.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU'RE KING
(BLEEP) ON MONEY TURD MOUNTAIN
EVERYBODY'S GUNNING FOR YOU.
LIKE MY GUEST TOMORROW HOUSE
MINORITY LEADER AND GLASS EYE
SUPERMODEL NANCY PELOSI.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE JUST RELEASED THIS AD
ATTACKING ME.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT USED TO BE MY
FRIEND, BUT SINCE THE DAY HE
STARTED HIS SUPER PAC TAKING
SECRET MONEY FROM SPECIAL
INTERESTS, HE'S BEEN OUT OF
CONTROL.
EVEN USING HIS SUPER PAC TO
ATTACK MY FRIEND NEWT GINGRICH.
(LAUGHTER)
IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH, I HEAR
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE KITTENS.
(LAUGHTER)
JOIN ME IN STOPPING COLBERT AND
CREATING A NEW POLITICS FREE OF
SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY.
THE FIRST STEP IS PASSING THE
DISCLOSE ACT.
LEARN MORE AT
FACEBOOK.COM/STOPCOLBERT.
(BOOS).
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
NANCY PELOSI... BOO!
A LITTLE LATE ON THAT.
NANCY PELOSI ATTACKED ME WITH
THE TWO MOST POWERFUL WEAPONS
IMAGINABLE-- A FLIP CAMERA AND
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD NIECE WITH
I-MOVIE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, FOLKS, WHAT STINGS IS
PELOSI'S CHARGE THAT I DON'T
LIKE KITTENS.
REALLY?
WOULD SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE
KITTENS HAVE ONE IN EACH HAND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND, FOLKS, THESE...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
THESE ARE NO MERE PROPS
PURCHASED RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
THESE ARE MY BELOVED PETS
WHISKERS AND... AND OTHER
WHISKERS.
(LAUGHTER)
I LOVE THESE TWO LITTLE KITTENS
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY BECOME
CATS.
(LAUGHTER)
GO DOWN THERE.
GO DOWN THERE, THERE YOU GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW NANCY PELOSI...
(LAUGHTER).
NANCY PELOSI IS SMEARING ME AND
MY SUPER PAC JUST SO SHE CAN
PUSH SHADOWY LEGISLATION CALLED
"THE DISCLOSE ACT" WHICH WOULD
FORCE HELPLESS SUPER PACS LIKE
MINE TO REVEAL THEIR TOP FIVE
DONORS IN EACH AD.
FIVE?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
I MEAN, NEWT'S PAC ONLY HAS ONE
DONOR.
TAKE AWAY SHELDON ADELSON AND
THE PRO-GINGRICH "WINNING OUR
FUTURE" PAC IS JUST A FEDERALLY
REGISTERED LEMONADE STAND.
BUT IF PELOSI REALLY WANTS
DISCLOSURE, SHE SHOULD GET HELP
FROM HER ANTI-SUPER PAC BUDDY
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
AFTER ALL, IN HIS 2010 STATE OF
THE UNION ADDRESS HE
TONGUE-LASHED THE SUPREME COURT
OVER CITIZENS UNITED AND DOUBLED
DOWN BEFORE THIS YEAR'S SUPER
BOWL.
>> ONE OF THE WORRIES WE HAVE,
OBVIOUSLY, IN THE NEXT CAMPAIGN
IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF
THESE SO-CALLED SUPER PACS,
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF
MONEY FLOATING AROUND AND I
GUARANTEE YOU A BUNCH OF THAT'S
GOING TO BE NEGATIVE.
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH
JUST TO SAY "THE OTHER GUY'S A
BUM."
>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THE OTHER
GUY'S A BUM.
YOU HAVE TO DESTROY YOUR
OPPONENT WITH A MOUNTAIN OF ADS
DEPICTING HIM AS A SHADY DRIFTER
RIDING THE RAILS, BURNING THE
CONSTITUTION IN TRASH FIRES FOR
WARMTH AND LEAVING IN HIS WAKE A
TRAIL OF DEAD PROSTITUTES.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT COSTS SERIOUS MONEY.
NOW, THAT ANTI-SUPER PAC J.D.
THERE WAS ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.
THIS IS 12 HOURS LATER.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN
BEGAN ASKING MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS
TO GIVE MONEY TO A SUPER PAC
THAT SUPPORTS THE PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: BOY, HE MUST HAVE
LOST A TON OF MONEY ON THE
PATRIOTS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD A VERY
GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THIS
COMPLETE 180.
>> YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND ON
SUPER PACS.
IT USED TO BE MORALLY WRONG AND
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE
MONEY.
>> I STILL THINK THE CITIZENS
UNITED DECISION MADE BY THE
SUPREME COURT WAS THE WRONG
DECISION.
WHAT I'VE SAID CONSISTENTLY IS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST
UNILATERALLY DISARM.
>> Stephen: YES!
NO MATTER HOW MORALLY WRONG YOU
BELIEVE A SYSTEM IS, YOU HAVE TO
USE IT IN ORDER TO DEFEAT IT!
IT'S LIKE HOW LINCOLN WON THE
CIVIL WAR BY BUYING A BUNCH OF
SLAVES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, OBAMA IS GOING TO
NEED THAT MONEY IN ORDER TO
FIGHT THE $100 MILLION THE KOCH
BROTHERS AND FRIENDS PLEDGED TO
DEFEAT OBAMA.
INCLUDING $40 MILLION FROM
CHARLES AND $20 MILLION FROM
DAVID.
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS DAVID'S
THE CHEAP ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHEN THE CHECK COMES FOR
OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT,
HE'S ALWAYS IN THE BATHROOM.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IN LIGHT OF MR. SMALL DONOR'S
REVERSAL ON SUPER PACS, I HAVE
JUST ONE THING TO SAY.
(LAUGHTER)
WELCOME, YOUNG PAC-WALKER.
FEEL THE POWER OF THE GREEN
SIDE.
EMBRACE YOUR DESTINY.
JOIN ME AND TOGETHER WE WILL
RULE THE GALAXY!
FOR FOUR YEARS, AFTER THAT IT
WILL BE SOMEBODY ELSE, MAYBE
HILLARY.
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THE GALAXY!
YOU ARE NOW DARTH DARTH-BAMA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
(SCREAMING)
