(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> HEY, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SOMUCH.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUTYOU, BUT I FOR ONE AM JUST
SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THELEFTIE LIBERAL
ENVIRONMENTALISTS TRYINGTO GUILT ME INTO DOING
THINGS LIKE RECYCLING ANDENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHT BULBS
AND NOT THROWING OLD CARBATTERIES INTO THE TANK AT
SEA WORLD.
YES, THOSE GREENS HAD MESEEING RED UNTIL THIS NEW
TREND BLEW MY MIND.
(LAUGHTER)MAGENTA.
>> IF YOU SEE A TRUCK INFRONT OF YOU BELCHING OUT
CLOUDS OF THICK BLACK SMOKE,COULD BE TROUBLE.
OR COULD BE A NEW TRENDCALLED ROLLING COAL.
>> DRIVERS PAYING THOUSANDSOF DOLLARS TO SHOOT BLACK
SMOKE AT OTHER PEOPLE ON THEROAD.
>> A NEW TREND CALLEDROLLING COAL.
>> ROLLING COAL, THAT'S WHATIT IS CALLING.
>> OW, ROLLING COAL OR AS WEUSED TO CALL IT A CLOGGED
AIR FILTER. FOR TOO LONG THOSEEARTH HUGGERS HAVE SHOVED THEIR
AGENDA DOWN OUR THROAT.
FINALLY THERE IS A WAY TOSHOVE OUR AGENDA DOWN THEIR
LUNGS.
SO HOW DOES ROLLING COALWORK?
OR BASED ON WHAT I KNOWABOUT EXHAUST SYSTEMS, NOT.
>> THE WAY THIS WORKS ISDIESEL VEHICLES ARE MODIFIED
TO INCREASE FUEL TO THEENGINE.
THE EXTRA FUEL THAT IT BURNSOFF AS THICK BLACK SMOKE.
AND IF YOU ADD IN A SMOKESTACK OR TWO THE COST OF
RIGGING YOUR RIG TO ROLLCOAL CAN BE ABOUT $5,000.
>> Stephen: $5,000.
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'SWAY CHEAPER THAN STRAPPING A
WEBER TO YOUR TESLA.
(LAUGHTER)AND ROLLING COAL ISN'T JUST
SMOKE BELCHING PUBLICNUISANCE, IT'S A SMOKE
BELCHING PUBLIC MESSAGE.
>> SOME SAY THEY ROLL COALBECAUSE IT'S FUN BUT MANY OF
THOSE WHO ARE DOING IT AREMAKING A POLITICAL
STATEMENT.
EITHER THUMBING THEIR NOSESAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TOLOWER CARBON EMISSIONS OR
JUST PLAIN FLIPPING OFFENVIRONMENTALISTS OR AS THEY
CALL THEM NATURE NUFFIES, THEONES WHO HATE ON HUMMERS TRUCKS
AND SUVs BUT LOVE THEIRPRIUS.
IN FACT, THE BLACK SOOTSPEWED BY COAL ROLLERS IS
OFTEN REFERRED TO AS PRIUSREPELLENT.
>> YEAH, BABY, PRIUS REPELLENT.THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO KEEP A
PRIUS AWAY FROM YOU IS DRIVINGOVER 45 MILES PER HOUR.
NOW A LOT OF COAL ROLLERS,FOLKS, A LOT OF COAL ROLLERS
OR CO-ROS AS NO ONE EVERCALLS THEM ARE EVEN
UPLOADING HILARIOUS VIDEOSOF THEM BLASTING SMOKE AT
PEOPLE STUPID ENOUGH TO WALKOR RIDE A BIKE.
AND IT'S GREAT FOR MEETINGTHE BABES.
>> DO YOU SMOKE?
>> YES, I DO.
>> STAND BY.
>> THAT WOULD MAKE ANY WOMANSWOON.
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OFBRAIN DAMAGE.
AND THEY DON'T DO TO ANYONEELSE WHAT THEY'RE NOT
WILLING TO DO TO THEMSELVES.
>> YOU SEE THAT, CLEAN AIRCROWD? YOU SEE THAT?
IF YOU ARE AGAINST COALROLLING, YOU HATE BLACK
PEOPLE.
AND IF YOU ASK ME, THAT'SSHAMEFUL.
AND IF YOU ASK ME, WOULD YOUIMPLICITLY DID BY WATCHING
THIS SHOW, I SAY COALROLLING IS THE BEST NEW WAY
TO STICK IT TO MOTHER EARTHSINCE PAINT CANNIN' WHERE YOU
DUMP OLD PAINT INTO A RIVER.
OR PORPOISE CORKING WHEREYOU HAMMER CORKS INTO THE
BLOW HOLES OF DOLPHINS.
WELL, WELL, FOLKS, I WANTIN.

PURE 4 CANON DIESEL ENGINEBLADE RUNNER MANIFOLD AND-- A
PAIR OF NUTS SO JIMMY,LET'S FIRE HER UP.
