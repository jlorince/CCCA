JUST LIKE THEY HAVE SEX.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF MITT ROMNEY DOES GET
THE NOMINATION, I WILL
SUPPORT HIM BECAUSE HE'S GOT
A BUILT-IN SELLING POINT.
AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BUSINESS END.ñr
FOLKS.
THE ECONOMY IS TANKING AND
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHY.
BARACK OBAMA HAS FEWER
PEOPLE PRIVATE SECTOR
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE IN HIS
CABINET THAN ANY PRESIDENT
IN A HUNDRED YEARS.
>> THIS PRESIDENT IS THE
MOST ANTI-BUSINESS PRESIDENT
WE'VE EVER HAD.
>> I THINK HE AND THOSE WHO
SURROUND HIM TO ADVISE HIM
DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RUN A
BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: YES, A PRESIDENT
NEEDS TO BE A GOOD
BUSINESSMAN.
LOOK AT LINCOLN.
HE HAD NO BUSINESS
EXPERIENCE, AND WHEN HE
MAN'S PATED THE SLAVES
UNEMPLOYMENT SHOT THROUGH
THE ROOF.
NOW MITT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: MITT ROMNEY HAS
THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE TO
LEAD USñr OUT OF THE OBAMA
SESSION BEFORE IT BECOMES A
FULL BLOWN OBAMA-PRESSION
AND WE ALL END UP
OBA-- BAMLESS LIVING IN THE
STREET BAMA.
>> I HELPED TURNED AROUND
BUSINESSES IN TROUBLE.
I ALSO AS YOU KNOW TOOK OVER
THE OLYMPICS WHEN THEY WERE
IN TROUBLE AND HELPED GET
THEM BACK ON TRACK.
>> PEOPLE SEE A GUY WHO HAS
BEEN A CAN-DO EXECUTIVE.
HE TURNED AROUND THE SALT
LAKE CITY OLYMPICS.
>> MITT ROMNEY, BUSINESS
LEGEND, RESCUED THE OLYMPICS.
>> Stephen: AND THOSE SALT
LAKE CITY WINTER OLYMPICS
ARE STILL GOING STRONG
TODAY.
BUT ROMNEY'S REAL CLAIM TO
BUSINESS FAME IS FOUNDING A
PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANY
CALLED BAIN CAPITAL.
WE WATCH MITT.
>> MY WORK LED ME TO BECOME
VERY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN
HELPING OTHER BUSINESSES
FROM START-UPS TO LARGE
COMPANIES THAT WERE GOING
THROUGH TOUGH TIMES.
SOMETIMES I WAS SUCCESSFUL
AND WE WERE ABLE TO HELP
CREATE JOBS.
OTHER TIMES I WASN'T.
>> Stephen: REFRESHING
HONESTY.
THERE'S YOUR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.
ROMNEY 2012, SOMETIMES GOODÑi.
YOU SEE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ROMNEY MADE A
MITT-LOAD OF CASH USING
WHAT'S KNOWN AS A LEVERAGED
BUYOUT.
HE WOULD BUY A COMPANY WITH
MONEY BORROWED AGAINST THEIR
ASSETS, GROOM!| THEM TO BE
SOLD OFF, AND IN THE INTE
COLLECT HUGE MANAGEMENT
FEES.
ONCE MITT HAD CONTROL OF THE
COMPANY HE WOULD CUT
FRIVOLOUS SPENDING LIKE JOBS,
WORKERS, EMPLOYEES, AND JOBS.
JUST LIKE AMERICA'S
SWEETHEART, GORDON GEKKO.
>> WHY DO YOU NEED TO
RECOGNIZE THIS COMPANY.
>> BECAUSE IT'S WRECKABLE,
ALL RIGHT.
>> THESE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR
JOBS THEY GOT NOWHERE TO GO.
MY FATHER HAS WORKED THERE
FOR 24 YEARS.
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT BUCKS, KID.
CAPITALISM-- .
>> Stephen: LIKE MANY
AMERICANS WHEN I SAW THAT
MOVIE I THOUGHT I WISH THAT
GUY WAS PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND EIGHT YEARS
LATER,.
>> I AM THE PRESIDENT.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AREN'T YOU READY
FOR ANOTHER PRESIDENT GEKKO?
BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY KNOWS
JUST HOW TO TRIM THE FAT.
HE RESCUED BUSINESSES LIKE
DAVID BERING, STAGE STORIES,
AMERICAN PAD & PAPER AND GS
INDUSTRIES.
THEN HIS COMPANY SOLD THEM
FOR A PROFIT OF $578
MILLION.
AFTER WHICH ALL OF THOSE
FIRMS DECLARED BANKRUPTCY.
WHICH SOUNDS BAD BUT DON'T
WORRY, ALMOST NO ONE WORKS
THERE ANY MORE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BESIDES.
A BUSINESSMAN CAN'T BE
WEIGHED DOWN WITH A BLEEDING
HEART.
AS ONE FORMER BAIN EMPLOYEE
PUT IT, IT WAS VERY
CLINICAL.
LIKE A DOCTOR.
WHEN THE PATIENT IS DEAD,
YOU JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
PATIENT.
SEE?
MITT ROMNEY IS LIKE A
DOCTOR.
AND FOLKS--
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS, PRESIDENT MITT
WOULD KNOW HOW TO TREAT
AMERICA'S SICK ECONOMY.
FIRST OF ALL, 300 MILLION
AMERICANS, ROMNEY WOULD HAVE
TO LAY SOME PEOPLE OFF.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME
REDUNDANCIES.
DO WE REALLY NEED RYAN
REYNOLDS AND RYAN GOSLING?
BESIDES, THERE ARE PLENTY OF
FOLKS IN MEXICO WILLING TO
BE AMERICAN FOR PENNIES ON
THE DOLLAR.
AND REALLY-- ISN'T TWO
DAKOTAS A LITTLE LAUGH SNIRB
I CAN'T TELL THEM APART.
WE SHOULD SELL ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THEN ROMNEY--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ROMNEY CAN JUST
TAKE IOWA, IDAHO AND OHIO
AND CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO
ONE VOWEL RICH STATE
IOHATAWA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> AND WHATEVER IS LEFT
ROMNEY WILL CHOP UP AND
REPACKAGE AS BUNDLED FREEDOM
DERIVATIVES.
THEN HE'LL JUST SHORT SELL
EVERYTHING WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI, WAIT FOR THE
MARKETS TO TANK AND BUY IT
BACK FOR A SONG.
NOW SOME LITTLE PEOPLE-- SOME
LITTLE PEOPLE OUT THERE
MIGHT GET HURT BUT THAT'S
HOW WALL STREET DOES
BUSINESS.
YOU SQUEEZE OUT MAXIMUM
VALUE FOR YOUR SHAREHOLDERS.
AND-- MITT ROMNEY CAN
GUARANTEE IT WILL WORK.
>> SOMETIMES I WAS
SUCCESSFUL.
OTHER TIMES I WASN'T.
>> OR MAYBE IT WON'T.
BUT ONE THING WE KNOW, IT
ALWAYS SEEMED TO WORK OUT
FOR MITT ROMNEY.
