NATION, I HAVE SPENT THELAST WEEK IN A RAGE.
OVER THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION'S800 PAGE NATIONAL CLIMATE
ASSESSMENT THAT CLAIMSWE'RE RUINING THE ENVIRONMENT
IT MADE ME SO ANGRY I PRINTEDIT FIVE TIMES.
NOW ORIGINALLY I DISMISSEDIT AS JUST A LAST STOP ON
OBAMA'S APOLOGY TOUR. FIRST HEBEGGED FORGIVENESS FROM EVERY
COUNTRY ON EARTH, NOW HE'SBEGGING FORGIVENESS FROM EARTH?
COME ON.
THEN I READ THE REPORT AND IHAVE TO ADMIT
IT WAS TERRIFYING THAT IT LEFT ACARBON FOOTPRINT IN MY PANTS.
JIM?
>> HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS,EXPERTS AND BUSINESSES NOT
FOR PROFIT, LOCALCOMMUNITIES, ALL CONTRIBUTED
OVER THE COURSE OF FOURYEARS WHAT THEY FOUND WAS
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT CLIMATECHANGE IS NOT SOME FAR OFF
PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S HAPPENING NOW.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE ISSUING ADIRE REPORT ON CLIMATE
CHANGE SUGGESTING THEEXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WE
ARE SEEING ACROSS THECOUNTRY ARE MAN-MADE.
>> A NEW STUDY SAYS THATCLIMATE CHANGE IS BEING FELT
TODAY IN ALL 50 STATES.
>> THE NORTHEAST IS GOING TOSEE MORE HEAT WAVES.
>> THE MIDWEST WOULD SUFFERMORE DROUGHT FOLLOWED BY
FLASH FLOODING.
>> HURRICANES IN THESOUTHEAST AND WILDFIRES OUT
WEST.
>> NO REGION OF THE COUNTRYWILL BE SPARED.
>> NO REGION SPARED.
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WILLBECOME AN UNINHABITABLE
WASTELAND NOT JUSTBALTIMORE.
SO FACING AN EXISTENTIALCRISIS BEYOND ANYTHING
HUMANITY HAS EVER KNOWN,WHAT DO WE DO?
WELL, THAT QUESTION BRINGSUS TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)[BLEEP] IT.
NOW FOLKS, FOLKS, GLOBALWARMING IS BAD.
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THATI HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT.
BUT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT ITIS, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET
TOO TECHNICAL HERE, HARD.
I AM AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE TOGIVE SOMETHING UP.
AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANTEDTO PASS THE PROBLEM ALONG TO
OUR GRANDCHILDREN, ALONGWITH SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY
AND MIDEAST PEACE.
>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TODO GRANDKIDS.
GET BORN ALREADY.
BUT-- IN LIGHT OF THIS NEWREPORT I COULD NO LONGER SIT
IDLY BY.
I HAD TO TAKE ACTION,CONSERVE ENERGY, DRIVE A
TESLA.
I EVEN STARTED SORTING, YOUKNOW, MY PAPER FROM MY
PLASTIC, YOU KNOW.
I HAVE NEVER RECYCLEDBEFORE.
AND YES, YES, IS THISSACRIFICE?
SURE.
BUT MY ONLY CONCERN WAS ISTHIS ENOUGH?
WELL, ON MONDAY I GOT MYANSWER.
>> SCIENTISTS WARN THAT ALARGE PART OF ANTARCTICA IS
MELTING AND CANNOT BESTOPPED.
>> THE GLACIERS ARE ON THEVERGE OF COLLAPSING.
>> 40 YEARS OF DATA SHOW THEGLACIERS ARE MELTING SO FAST
IT IS NOW UNSTOPPABLE.
>> SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S TOOLATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THE MELTING GLACIERS.
>> [BLEEP] IT.
ALL RIGHT IT-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> UNSTOPPABLE MELTING.
IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS NOW.
I MEAN WHAT-- WHAT A RELIEFI DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD
HAPPEN BUT WE'VE FINALLY RANTHE CLOCK OUT ON THE
POSSIBILITY OF MY PERSONALSACRIFICE MAKING A
DIFFERENCE.
AND FOLKS, I AM NOT THE ONLYONE SPREADING THIS MESSAGE
OF HOPE.
SO IS FLORIDA SENATOR MARCORUBIO WHO SAID THIS ON
SUNDAY.
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH THENOTION THAT SOME ARE PUTTING
OUT THERE INCLUDINGSCIENTISTS THAT SOMEHOW
THERE ARE ACTIONS WE CANTAKE TODAY THAT WOULD
ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ONWHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR
CLIMATE YES THERE ARE NOACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TODAY.
AN ACTION ON SUNDAY MIGHTHAVE HELPED OR ANY DAY
BEFORE THAT, BUT NOW THAT'SALL WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.
AND TELL THEM WHY TV MAN.
>> THE THAW COULD TRIGGERRISING SEA LEVELS BY UP TO
12 FEET OVER HUNDREDS OFYEARS.
THAT IS ENOUGH TO PUT MIAMIBEACH UNDERWATER.
>> OKAY, MIAMI.
IF YOU LIKE LEBRON JAMESPLAYING BASKETBALL, YOU'LL
LOVE HIM PLAYING WATER POLO.
SO WHAT NOW?
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEYSAY?
IF YOU CAN'T STOP CLIMATECHANGE, LAY BACK AND ENJOY
IT.
BUT NOW-- NOW THAT IT'STOTALLY FUTILE, LET'S STOP
ARGUING ABOUT DIVISIVE ISSUESLIKE CARBON TAXES, ALTERNATIVE
ENERGY OR WALKING.
INSTEAD, WE MUST COMETOGETHER AND DO WHAT
AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE,WE MUST BURN HYDROCARBONS
FOR PLEASURE.
AND I BELIEVE THIS FAILURETO FIND A SOLUTION COULD BE
THE SOLUTION TO ALL OUROTHER FAILURES.
DO WE HAVE BAD SCHOOLS?
WELL, IF WE DO NOTHING,EVENTUALLY NO ONE WILL KNOW
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU WORRIED?
ARE YOU WORRIED?
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT MONEYIN POLITICS IS UNDERMINING
DEMOCRACY?
JUST DO NOTHING AND SOONTHERE WILL BE NO DEMOCRACY
LEFT TO UNDERMINE.
ARE YOU-- AND YOUR LOVED ONEHAVING RELATIONSHIP
PROBLEMS?
JUST DO NOTHING AND THEPROBLEMS WILL GO AWAY ALONG
WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP BUTFOLKS, FOR THE RECORD, I
WANT TO BE CLEAR, I'M NOTSAYING WE JUST FIDDLE WHILE
ROME BURNS.
I SAY WE THROW THE FIDDLE ONTHE FIRE TUBE.
I MEAN THAT FIDDLE IS GOODSKINDLING WHICH WE WILL NEED
TO KEEP THE FIRE GOING ASTHE FLOODWATERS RISE.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
