ABOUT THIS GUY.
>> THERE'S NO GREATER CATHOLICTHAN YOURS TRULY BUT WHAT'S THE
POPE'S ANGLE ON THIS ONE.
WHY IS HE GUNNING FOR THE BIGMONEY PEOPLE.
JESUS TELLS US TO CARE FOR THEPOOR AND THE POPE SAYS I CARE
FOR BOTH THE POOR AND RICH ALIKEBUT HE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO
TELL EVERYONE THE RICH NEED TOCARE AND RESPECT THE POOR.
POOR.
>> HE'S NOT ATTACKING THE POOR.
HE'S GOT TO ATTACK THEM BOTH.
THAT'S HIS GOSPEL.
[APPLAUSE]DO UNTO OTHERS, DO UNTO OTHERS
AS YOU WOULD DO UNTO ALL OFTHEM.

BUT THE RICH GUYS FEEL ATTACKEDBY THE POPE BECAUSE WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO TO DO THE RIGHTTHING.
I GOT A LOT OF CASH.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO FOR THEPOOR.
>> WELL IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOVE THE POORFIRST OF ALL OR RESPECT THEM.
AND THEN HELP THEM AS JESUS ASKSUS TO.
>> Stephen:  LOVE IS KIND OF AVAGUE WORD.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen:  IT'S PRETTY BUTDO YOU MEAN LIKE LOVE $5 GRANDMA
CARD BERT DAY LOVE OR LIKE YOUKNOW CARE.

WE'RE MEANT TO HELP THEM AS MUCHAS WE CAN AND JESUS TELLS US
THAT WE'LL BE JUDGED IN THE LASTJUDGMENT FOR HOW WELL WE TOOK
CARE OF THE POOR, THE LEAST OFHER BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH POPEFRANCIS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
JESUS.

WE RICH PEOPLE ONLY HAVE OURSTUFF.
[LAUGHTER]DO YOU REALIZE WHAT AN EMPTY
REWARD THAT IS.
IT DOES NOT NOTHING FOR ME.
MEANWHILE THE POOR PEOPLE KNOWWHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE CLOSE TO
GOD.
WHAT WOULD I GIVE TO BE POOROTHER THAN MY MONEY.
>> THAT'S THE POINT.
I MEAN CHRIST INVITES YOU ANDTHEY'RE SIMPLE LIVING TO HELP
THE POOR AS A WAY TOPARTICIPATE.
SO IT'S ONLY INVITATION IT'S NOTA COMMAND OR DIRECTIVE IT'S AN
INVITATION TO LOVE THE POOR ANDBE WITH THE POOR AND THEREFORE
BE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT JESUSLOVES THE MOST.
MOST.

EITHER.

US FOR OUR MONEY.
ARE THERE ANY INDULGENCES LAYINGAROUND.

THAT'S BASICALLY IT.
IT'S HARD TO HEAR.

>> BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ANINVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN A
BEAUTIFUL PLACE WHICH IS CALLEDTHE RAIN OF GOD.
>> Stephen:  WHAT WILL I GETFROM THAT?
