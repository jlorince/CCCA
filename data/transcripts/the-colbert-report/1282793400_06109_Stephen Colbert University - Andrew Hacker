GIVE IT UP FOR HIM.
GIVE IT UP FOR HIM.
FOLKS, DID YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE
COLLEGE GRADUATE EARNS TWICE AS
MUCH AS A PERSON WITH ONLY A
HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE?
WHICH IN THIS CURRENT JOB MARKET
WORK OUT TO...
[LAUGHTER]
ZERO DOLLARS.
[APPLAUSE]
AND... IT'S NO WONDER.
WHAT DO NOT-FOR-PROFIT
UNIVERSITIES KNOW ABOUT MAKING
CASH?
LUCKILY THERE ARE FOR-PROFIT
COLLEGES OUT THERE, LIKE KAPLAN
UNIVERSITY, THE ART INSTITUTE
AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX.
THEY'RE SO CONVENIENT SOME LET
YOU ATTEND ON THE INTERKNELT, SO
INSTEAD OF ROLLING OUT OF BED
AND GOING TO CLASS LOOKING LIKE
A SLOB, YOU CAN STAY IN BED AND
GO LOOKING LIKE A LEVEL 55 DEATH
KNIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, FOLKS,
YOU KNOW IT'S A QUALITY
EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU GET WHAT
YOU PAY FOR.
FOR INSTANCE, A MASSAGE THERAPY
CERTIFICATE AT A COMMUNITY
COLLEGE COULD COST $520, WHILE A
SIMILAR CERTIFICATE AT
FOR-PROFIT UNIVERSITIES CAN COST
UP TO $14,000.
I ASSUME THAT DEGREE COMES WITH
FULL RELIEF.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT EVIDENTLY, FOLKS, THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION JUST HATES
EDUCATION.
>> FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES UNDER
FIRE.
TWO GOVERNMENT REPORTS OUT
DETAILING WHAT IT SAYS ARE
DECEPTIVE RECRUITMENT AND LOAN
TACTICS.
>> FOUR OF THE 15 FOR-PROFIT
COLLEGES TARGETED ENCOURAGED
UNDERCOVER APPLICANTS TO COMMIT
OUTRIGHT FRAUD.
ALL 15 ENGAGED IN DECEPTIVE
PRACTICES.
>> Stephen: DECEPTIVE
PRACTICES?
BIG DEAL.
I SAY CAVEAT EMPTOR, WHICH
ACCORDING TO MY ONLINE LATIN
DEGREE MEANS "SOUP OF THE DAY."
[LAUGHTER]
SO WHAT.
SO WHAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO WHAT IF ACCORDING TO ONE
FORMER RECRUITER THE SCHOOL PAYS
THEM $800 PER STUDENT THEY ROUND
UP.
THAT JUST INCENTIVIZES THEM TO
ATTRACT NON-TRADITIONAL CO-EDS.
>> BENSON RAWLINS, WHO LIVED IN
A HOMELESS SHELTER IN CLEVELAND
OHIO, WHERE LAST YEAR HE MET TWO
RECRUITERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF PHOENIX WHO PITCHED HIM AND
OTHER HOMELESS MEN ON AN
EDUCATION WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT
THEM IN DEBT ABOUT $15,000.
>> Stephen: I SAY THEY'RE JUST
THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX BY
HUSTLING PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN
BOXES.
BUT THESE SCHOOLS ARE OWNED BY
REPUTABLE CORPORATIONS, LIKE
GOLDMAN SACKS.
WHICH OWNS 38% OF THE SECOND
LARGEST ONLINE COLLEGE.
AND WHO BETTER THAN ECONOMICS
PROFESSOR BLANKFEIN TO TEACH OUR
KIDS ABOUT FINANCIAL RUIN.
WELL, FOLKS, I WANT IN.
THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO
INTRODUCE MY NEW FOR-PROFIT
SCHOOL, STEPHEN COLBERT
UNIVERSITY.
THE NUMBER-ONE PLACE...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
...FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.
STEPHEN COLBERT UNIVERSITY IS
OPEN TO ANYBODY WITH AN INTERNET
CONNECTION AND A LETTER OF
RECOMMENDATION FROM BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN.
OR TWO LETTERS FROM ULYSSES S.
GRANT.
AT STEPHEN COLBERT U, WE OFFER
PROGRAMS IN EXCITING FIELDS AS
NURSE IMPERSONATOR, GRAVEROBBER,
V.C.R. REPAIR, GOOGLER.
REMEMBER, AT SCU, WE PUT THE YOU
IN WE MAKE MONEY OFF YOU.
ASK ANY EXPERT AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU STEPHEN COLBERT UNIVERSITY
IS ONE OF THE DEALS AROUND.
HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IS THE
AUTHOR OF "HIGHER EDUCATION: HOW
COLLEGES ARE WASTING OUR MONEY
AND FAILING OUR KIDS AND WHAT WE
CAN DO ABOUT IT."
PLEASE WELCOME PROFESSOR ANDREW
HACKER.
PROFESSOR HACKER, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THERE WE ARE.
"HIGHER EDUCATION."
ARE THESE ONLINE UNIVERSITIES
RIPOFFS?
ARE WE RIPPING PEOPLE OFF WITH
THESE?
>> I'M AFRAID WE RUSSIA STEPHEN.
WHAT YOU GET, AS YOU SAY,
SITTING IN YOUR PAJAMAS, YOU'RE
LOOKING AT A COMPUTER SCREEN,
THAT IS NOT HIGHER EDUCATION.
>> Stephen: BUT WHY IS THAT
NOT HIGHER EDUCATION?
DOES EVERYBODY HAVE TO GO TO ONE
OF YOUR CORDUROY JACKET,
ELBOW-PATCH KIND OF COLLEGES?
>> I WOULD SAY SO, YES.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY.
REALLY?
ARE YOU AN OBJECTIVE OBSERVER?
WHERE DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE?
>> A JUNIOR COUSIN OF DARTMOUTH
CALLED AMHERST COLLEGE.
>> WHERE ELSE?
>> I THEN WENT TO PRINCETON.
FOR Ph.D. D.
AND I SPENT TWO YEARS AT OXFORD.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WAS THIS ONLINE OXFORD?
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO, ACTUALLY YOU SAT IN A
ROOM WITH A TUTOR, AND THE TUTOR
SMOKED HIS PIPE.
>> Stephen: BUT WHAT IS SO
MUCH BETTER... AREN'T THESE BIG
COLLEGES RIPPING US OFF THE SAME
WAY?
I MEAN, WHO USES THE THINGS THEY
LEARN IN COLLEGE NECESSARILY,
AND WHY IS THEIR CRUSHING DEBT
ANY BETTER THAN THE CRUSHING
DEBT WE GET FROM AN ONLINE
COLLEGE?
>> THIS IS A FANTASTIC QUESTION.
>> Stephen: AND I DIDN'T GO TO
ONE OF YOUR FANCY COLLEGES.
[APPLAUSE]
>> FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE TRACKED
A CLASS AT AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL
ALL THE WAY FROM THE TIME THEY
WERE ADMITTED UNTIL THEY'RE NOW
MAKING SOMETHING OF THEIR LIVES.
VERY AVERAGE.
THEY ENDED UP NOT MUCH BETTER
THAN MY STUDENTS AT QUEENS
COLLEGE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
[LAUGHTER]
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES IN
COLLEGE.
WHY CAN'T ONE OF THOSE MISTAKES
BE GOING TO COLLEGE?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH
SIX FIGURES IN DEBT.
PEOPLE AGED 22 ARE NOW
GRADUATING.
THEY HAVE $50,000 IN DEBT.
AND ONCE THE INTEREST IS ADDED
IN, THEY'ER GOING TO HAVE TO PAY
$100,000.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO SPEND
YOUR 20s.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO GO
TO COLLEGE TO BE SUCCESSFUL?
>> YOU HAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE TO
BE PROPERLY MIDDLE CLASS.
TO BECOME, AS IT WERE, ONE OF
US.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH B.A.s
AND PEOPLE WITHOUT B.A.s, AND
THERE'S A SHARP DIVIDE BETWEEN
THEM.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF THE PEOPLE
WITHOUT B.A.s JUST PICK UP
PITCHFORKS AND KILL ALL THE
PEOPLE WITH B.A.s?
WOULDN'T THAT BREAK DOWN THE
DIVIDE?
>> WELL, THE PEOPLE WITH B.A.s
WOULD TRY REASON WITH THEM
BECAUSE...
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: IT'S HARD TO
REASON ON THE END OF A
PITCHFORK, MY FRIEND.
IS COLLEGE WORTH IT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PROFESSOR ANDREW HACKER.
