THAT SPANKING MACHINE.
AND FOLKS, I AM TAKING THE
DECISION ON DOMA EXTRA HARD HERE
BECAUSE I WAS IN SUCH A GOOD
MOOD AFTER YESTERDAY'S GREAT
DECISION.
>> TODAY THE SUPREME COURT
ESSENTIALLY KNOCKED DOWN ONE OF
THE PILLARS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS
MOVEMENT: IT INVALIDATED A KEY
PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,
THE LAW ENACTD IN 1965 TO STOP
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AT THE
POLLS.
>> AT ISSUE WAS A PROVISION IN
THE ACT THAT SINGLED OUT STATES
WITH A HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION
AND VOTING MOSTLY IN THE SOUTH
AND REQUIRED THEM TO GET
PRECLEARANCE, APPROVAL FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE
CHANGING VOTING PROCEDURES.
>> Stephen: LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, AS A SON OF THE SOUTH
FROM ONE OF THE STATES COVERED
BY THE PRECLEARANCE PROVISION OF
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT I WANT TO
THANK THE SUPREME COURT FOR
FINALLY SETTING MY PEOPLE FREE.
IT WAS A 5-4 DECISION WITH CHIEF
JUSTICE ROBERTS JOINED BY
JUSTICES SCALIA, THOMAS, ALITO
AND DEEN.
NOW, EVERYBODY IS BETTER WITH
BUTTER.
NOW, FOLKS, IN HIS DECISION
GUTTING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SAGELY
NOTED SOMETHING MANY OF US HAD
APPARENTLY MISSED ABOUT
DISCRIMINATION SAYING, QUOTE,
NEARLY FIST YEARS LATER THINGS
HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
TRUE.
FOR INSTANCE, THERE USED TO BE A
VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
BUT WE DON'T NEED IT NOW BECAUSE
APPARENTLY RACISM IS OVER.
NOW I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT AND
NO ONE CAN CALL IT RACIST.
HIT IT, JIMMY.
OLD MAN RIBBER, DAT OLD MAN
RIBBER ♪♪
♪ HE MUST KNOW SUMTIN', BUT
DON'T SAY NOTTIN ' ♪♪
>> Stephen: TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES?
JIMMY, CAN WE GET AN ASIAN ON
THAT, PLEASE.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, NOT EVERYONE
IS READY TO EMBRACE JOHN ROBERTS
THE POST RACIAL UTOPIA LIKE MEAN
OLD LADY GINSBURG WHO WROTE IN
HER HISSY FIT THROWING OUT
PRECLEARANCE WHEN IT HAS WORKED
AND IS CONTINUING TO WORK TO
STOP DISCRIMINATORY CHANGES IS
LIKE THROWING AWAY YOUR UMBRELLA
IN A RAINSTORM BECAUSE YOU ARE
NOT GETTING WET.
OH, DON'T BE SUCH AN ALARMIST.
( APPLAUSE )
DON'T BE SUCH AS AN ALARMIST.
I'M SURE IT WILL BE YEARS BEFORE
MISSISSIPPI TAKES THE VOTE AWAY
FROM DAMP PEOPLE.
NOW, THANKFULLY, NOT EVERYONE IS
STUCK IN THE PAST LIKE GEORGIA
GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL, WHO
CELEBRATED THE RULING SAYING,
"OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURY
GEORGIA HAS REFORMED AND OUR
STATE IS IS A PROUD SYMBOL OF
PROGRESS."
YES, GEORGIA IS A TRUE SYMBOL OF
RACIAL PROGRESS.
AFTER ALL, GEORGIA HASN'T HAD
THIS FLAG SINCE 2003.
SO WHAT DO THESE CASES HAVE IN
COMMON?
GRAB A PENCIL, FOLKS BECAUSE
HERE IT COMES.
IN DOMA AND THE VOTING RIGHTS
ACT CASES, IT WAS ABOUT STATES'
RIGHTS, NOT THE PEOPLE IN THOSE
STATES.
THAT'S WHY THE FIRST WORDS OF
THE CONSTITUTION ARE "WE THE
STATES."
I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO READ
THOSE GAY LETTERS.
WE'LL BE BACK WITH EMILY
BAZELON.
