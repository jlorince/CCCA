(LAUGHTER)
WELL, TANK INFULLY FOLKS IT'S
ONE GROUP THAT IS ALWAYS DISHING
OUT THE FRISKY BUFFET, THE
T.S.A.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAFETY OF
THIS NATION IN THE PALMS OF
THEIR HAND.
ALSO YOUR GENITALS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THERE --
(LAUGHTER).
AND THEY'RE FINDING ALL SORTS OF
NEW PLACES TO DO IT.
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT A
SPECIAL T.S.A. TEAM SEARCHING
YOU BEFORE YOU SEE YOUR FAVORITE
SPORTS TEAM OR CONCERT?
THE T.S.A.'S EXPANDED DUTIES NOW
INCLUDE SECURITY CHECKS AT
PASSENGER TRAIN, SUBWAY, AND BUS
STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION.
>> THEY'RE NOW EXPANDING INTO
SPORTING EVENTS, RODEOS, MUSIC
FESTIVALS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
T.S.A. AGENTS ARE HEADED TO OUR
STADIUMS AND PASSENGER TRAINS.
AND THE HIRING PROCESS SHOULD BE
EASY SINCE THERE'S ALREADY
PLENTY OF GUYS ON THE SUBWAY
READY TO GIVE PATDOWNS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THANK GOODNESS, FOLKS.
THANK GOODNESS THE T.S.A. WILL
BE ABLE TO SECURE OUR VULNERABLE
RODEOS.
BUT A WORD OF ADVICE FOR
BRONCOS: THOSE HORSESHOES ARE
GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE AT THE
METAL DETECTOR SO INVEST IN SOME
CROCS NOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT FOLKS THIS MASSIVE EXPANSION
COMES AFTER REPORTS THAT THE
T.S.A. MISCONDUCT INCREASED 26%
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WELL,
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE UP TO
SPREAD MISCONDUCT OVER A BROADER
SAMPLE SIZE.
JUST LIKE IF YOU EVER CHEAT ON
YOUR GIRLFRIEND YOU HAVE TO GET
A BUNCH MORE GIRLFRIEND SO
YOU'RE MORE FAITHFUL PER CAPITA.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS EXPANSION OF THE T.S.A.
BEYOND AIRPORTS IS KNOWN AS
VIPR.
THERE'S NO "E" IN THAT WORD
BECAUSE IT WAS DETAINED FOR
APPEARING TWICE IN THE WORD
"YEMEN."
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, AS VIPR MISSION
CLEARLY STATES, T.S.A.'S VISIBLE
INTERMODAL PREVENTION AND
RESPONSE PROGRAM IS PART OF A
NATIONWIDE SECURITY PROGRAM THAT
SERVES ALL MODES OF
TRANSPORTATION.
YOU HEAR THAT?
ALL MODE!
THAT MEANS CARS-- INCLUDING
NASCARS.
SOME BEFORE EACH LAP THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO GET STOPPED FOR
A SCREENING.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE
EVERYONE'S SAFE BEFORE THEY
CRASH FOR OUR AMUSEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, OBVIOUSLY WE ALSO NEED
AGENTS TO MONITOR CHAIR LIFTS.
THINK ABOUT IT: THEY'RE FULL OF
SUSPICIOUS PEOPLE WEARING MASKS
WHO NEVER RIDE THEM ROUND TRIP,
JUST ONE WAY.
WHERE DO THEY GO?
NO ONE KNOWS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, WHAT ABOUT THE MOST
WIDELY USED AMERICAN
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OF ALL?
LEGS.
WITH ALL THE THREATS OUT THERE,
WOULDN'T YOU FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE WITH THE T.S.A.
AGENT CLINGS TO ONE AT ALL
