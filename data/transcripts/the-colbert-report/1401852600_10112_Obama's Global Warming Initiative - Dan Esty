WHY ON EARTH?
YOU EXPLAIN TO ME,MR. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES YALE
SMARTY PANTS, WHY IS OBAMADECLARING WAR ON COAL AND IS HE
GOING TO DRAW THE TROOPS OUT OFAFGHANISTAN AND SEND THEM
STRAIGHT INTO WEST VIRGINIA?
>> STEPHEN, I'M AFRAID TO TELLYOU THERE'S NO WAR.
>> Stephen: WAR ON COAL.
NO WAR ON COAL.
>> Stephen: IT'S A MODESTFIRST STEP.
IT'S A POLICE ACTION AGAINSTCOAL.
LIKE KENNEDY TOOK A MODEST STEPIN VIETNAM.
>> HE'S DONE COMMON SENSE THINGSTO BEGIN A TRANSITION TO A CLEAN
ENERGY FUTURE.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT CLEANCOAL, IT HAS THE WORD CLEAN IN
IT, YOU'VE GOTTA ADMIT THAT.
>> IT COULD BE WE WILL HAVECLEAN COAL BUT WE NEED A BROADER
PORTFOLIO AND WE HAVE A CHANCETO SHIFT TOWARD CHEAPER AND
CLEANER NATURAL GAS IN A PRETTYBIG WAY.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ENVIRONMENTALTYPES ARE ALL FOR FRACKING,
SHATTERING THE BEDROCK WITH ASLURRY OF UNKNOWN CHEMICALS.
>> THERE IS NEED FORREGULATIONS --
>> Stephen: HERE WE GO,REGULATIONS.
WON'T REGULATIONS AND CLOSINGTHE COAL PLANTS, WON'T THAT COST
AMERICAN JOBS?
>> NOT NECESSARILY.
THERE WILL BE SOME TRANSITION.
>> Stephen: YEAH?
THERE IS ALSO A HUGEPOTENTIAL -- IF YOU LOOK AT
WHAT WE DID IN THE STATEOF CONNECTICUT, WHERE WE'VE
BEGUN THE TRANSITION, RAMPING UPRENEWABLE ENERGY, SOLAR, WIND
AND A VARIETY OF -->> Stephen: THE SUN SHINES IN
CONNECTICUT?
>> THE BIGGEST SOLAR POWERCOUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS GERMANY,
WHICH IS LESS SUNNY THANCONNECTICUT.
SO THERE ARE PLACES THAT MADETHIS TRANSITION BEGIN TO HAPPEN
AND YOU'RE SEEING JOB GROWTH INDEPLOYMENT OF THE RENEWABLE
RESOURCES, DELIVERING ENERGY FOREVERY HOUSE AND IT'S LOWER COST
AND GREATER COMPETITIVENESS.

TRANSITION.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLEWILL BE IN THE TRANSITION BREAD
LINES?
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW, IF THERE WERE
REALLY A SERIOUS EFFORT TO MAKETHIS WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TOINVEST IN WEST VIRGINIA AS A
RESEARCH CENTER FOR WIND POWER,SOLAR POWER AND SOME OF THE NEW
TECHNOLOGIES.
>> Stephen: OBAMA IS LETTINGEVERY STATE DO THIS IN THEIR OWN
WAY.
THERE'S A STANDARD BUT EVERYSTATE GETS TO SET UP THEIR OWN
CARBON EXCHANGES OR WHATEVERTHEY WANT.
>> THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY -->> Stephen: BECAUSE POLLUTION
STAYS IN A PARTICULAR STATE? ITDOESN'T GO FROM STATE TO STATE?
>> FLOWS STATE TO STATE ANDGLOBAL WARMING.
THE GREENHOUSE GASES  BLANKETTHE EARTH SO THERE'S A NEED TO
GET A GLOBAL PICTURE OF THISTAKEN CARE OF.
YOU START IN EACH COUNTRY BUT TOGET IT ON THE GROUND, STATE
LEVEL ACTION MAKES SENSE.
>> Stephen: YOU SCIENCE PEOPLEPUT YOUR FAITH IN GLOBAL
WARMING. YOU TELL ME WHEN IBREATHE OUT I'M BREATHING OUT
CO2. SO DO I HAVE TO BREATHE 30%LESS BY 2030, OR CAN I DO CARBON
OFFSETS BY SMOTHERING A POORPERSON WITH A PILLOW?
(LAUGHTER)IT'S OKAY!
OBAMA WANTS ME TO!
