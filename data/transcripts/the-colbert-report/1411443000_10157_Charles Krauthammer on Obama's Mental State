>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
FOLKS, AS A CONSERVATIVE PUNDIT,IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO
CAREFULLY WEIGH THE FACTS ANDOBJECTIVELY DETERMINE HOW OUR
PRESIDENT IS WRONG.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO ANALYZINGWHAT'S GOING ON IN SKULL FORCE
ONE, MY HERO HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOXNEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER
HARVARD-TRAINED PSYCHIATRIST,CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, WHO
RECENTLY ENRICHED OUR PUBLICDEBATE ON THE HUGH HEWITT SHOW.
>> I KNOW YOU'VE SAID BEFORE YOUNO LONGER PRACTICE PSYCHIATRY.
YOU'VE GIVEN THAT UP.
BUT I WANT TO TEMPT YOU TO DO ALITTLE ARMCHAIR DIAGNOSIS HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HISMENTAL STATE?
>> LOOK, I HAVE FORESWORNPSYCHIATRY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU
REALLY CAN'T DO IT AT ADISTANCE.
SO I DECIDED, WHEN I LEFTPSYCHIATRY, NEVER TO USE MY
AUTHORITY.
>> STEPHEN: GOOD FOR HIM.
HE HAS SWORN NOT TO USE HISPSYCHIATRIC AUTHORITY.
SO I GUESS THIS INTERVIEW'SOVER.
>> BUT LET ME JUST SAY AS ALAYMAN, WITHOUT INVOKING ANY
EXPERTISE, OBAMA IS CLEARLY ANARCISSIST.
>> STEPHEN: OBAMA IS CLEARLY ANARCISSIST.
WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THATBIRTH CERTIFICATE.
HE COULD EASILY BE FROMNARCISSISTAN.
OF COURSE, BEING A NARCISSIST ISNOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING.
IN FACT, WHEN YOU LOOK UPNARCISSIST IN THE DICTIONARY,
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO A PICTURE OFME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND, YES, I'VE PASTED MY PHOTO
NEXT TO EVERY WORD IN MYDICTIONARY.
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A BIT OF AN AARDVARK.
AND KRAUTHAMMER IS WILLING TOBACK UP HIS NON-DIAGNOSIS WITH
HARD NON-DATA.
>> I MEAN, COUNT THE NUMBER OFTIMES HE USES THE WORD "I" IN
ANY SPEECH.
REMEMBER WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THEKILLING OF BIN LADEN?
THAT SPEECH, I BELIEVE, HAD 29REFERENCES TO "I."
ON MY COMMAND, I ORDERED, ASCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WAS THEN
TOLD, I THIS.
>> STEPHEN: YES, OBAMA ISOBSESSED WITH SAYING "I."
CAN'T HE FIND A BETTER WAY TOREFER TO HIMSELF?
"ME "CAN.
AND REMEMBER THE HIGH MATH THATCOUNT KRAUTULA DID FOR US -
>> THAT SPEECH HAD, I BELIEVE,29 REFERENCES TO "I."
>> STEPHEN: THOSE NUMBERSDON'T LIE.
THOUGH, EVIDENTLY HE DOES.
BECAUSE I'VE READ THE SPEECH ANDBARACK OBAMA USED THE WORD "I"
11 TIMES IN HIS BIN LADENSPEECH, NOT 29, AS COMPARED TO
KRAUTHAMMER, WHO SAID "I" 36TIMES IN THAT INTERVIEW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: NOW, FOLKS, FOR
THE RECORD, I HAVE FORESWORN MYPSYCHIATRIC AUTHORITY BECAUSE I
NEVER HAD ANY AND, TO BE CLEAR,I AM NOT CLAIMING ANY INSIGHT OR
TRAINING OR INTEREST IN HUMANBEHAVIOR, BUT IN MY LAYMAN'S
OPINION, AS IF I WERE RAISED BYWOLVES,
I JUST WANT TO SAY A FORMERPSYCHIATRIST WILLING TO GIVE AN
ON-AIR DIAGNOSIS OF A STRANGER,WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CLAIMING
HE ISN'T DOING THAT, IS NOT ANARCISSIST, HE'S JUST KIND OF A
DICK.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
