[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
EXCELLENT JOB.
FOR JUST A MOMENT THERE FOLKS, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT TO DROP THE BALL IN MID JUGGLE BUT
YOU GOT IT BACK.
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A BLESSED EASTER, FULL OF CHOCOLATE BUNNIES AND CHOCOLATE
EGGS AND CHOCOLATE HAMS.
[LAUGHTER]
I DIDN'T ENJOY EASTER THIS YEAR.
AND NEITHER DID THIS FRIEND OF MINE NAMED JESUS.
[LAUGHTER]
TELL 'EM WHY, FOX.
>> A GROWING CONTROVERSY THIS HOUR FOR GOOGLE.
>> THE SEARCH ENGINE GIANT CHOOSES TO CELEBRATE LABOR LEADER CESAR CHAVEZ WITH ONE OF
THEIR FAMOUS DOODLES ON SUNDAY.
>> SOME CHRISTIANS ARE UPSET AT GOOGLE NOW BECAUSE, IN FACT, THEY'RE CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT.
THEY DECIDED TO HONOR CESAR CHAVEZ INSTEAD OF HONORING EASTER.
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WHAT, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?
HONORING THE FOUNDER OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS WHO SAID, "THE TRUEST ACT OF COURAGE IS TO
SACRIFICE YOURSELF FOR OTHERS." THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JESUS' CORE MESSAGE OF JELLY
BEANS AND PLASTIC GRASS!
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHY THIS BREAK WITH TRADITION?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
GOOGLE HAS ALWAYS HONORED EASTER, EVERY SINGLE-- ONCE 13 YEARS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEY CLEARLY HAVEN'T LEARNED THEIR LESSON BECAUSE TODAY THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR REGULAR
LOGO INSTEAD OF HONORING APRIL FIRST AS THE FEAST DAY OF SAINT MELITO OF SARDIS, WHO DIED A EUNUCH.
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO HONOR HIM.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND DOODLE-GATE ISN'T THE ONLY SCANDAL I FOUND IN MY BASKET.
THIS IS EASTER UNDER ATTACK.
♪ ♪ POPE EDITION!
FOLKS, I WAS WILLING TO GIVE POPE FRANCIS A CHANCE, BUT IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THERE'S BEEN ONE INSULT TO TRADITION AFTER ANOTHER.
FIRST, THE NIGHT HE WAS CHOSEN, POPE FRANCIS EMERGED WEARING A SIMPLE WHITE CASSOCK, INSTEAD OF
THE TRADITIONAL ERMINE-TRIMMED VELVET MOZZETTA.
[LAUGHTER]
COME ON!
ARE YOU THE VICAR OF CHRIST, OR THE SPOKESMAN FOR LINENS 'N' THINGS?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW BENEDICT KNEW HOW TO ROCK IT!
I SAY YOU'RE NOT REALLY THE HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH UNLESS YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE IN A
LIBERACE COVER BAND!
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IL PAPA SAVED HIS BIGGEST INSULT FOR EASTER WEEKEND.
>> THERE'S ALREADY BEEN ONE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE THAT HAS ANNOYED TRADITIONALISTS: THE WAY
HE INCLUDED TWO WOMEN IN A HOLY WEEK CEREMONY REPRESENTING THE MOMENT WHEN CHRIST WASHED THE
FEET OF HIS 12 DISCIPLES-- ALL MEN.
>> SOME CHURCH CONSERVATIVES SAY THE CHANGE SETS A BAD EXAMPLE.
>> SOME ARE SAYING WHY WERE THERE WOMEN THERE?
>> Stephen: YEAH, WHY WERE THERE WOMEN THERE?
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS RE-ENACTING A EVENT FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT.
AND THERE ARE NO WOMEN IN THE GOSPELS.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S A COMMON MISTRANSLATION.
JESUS WAS ACTUALLY BORN OF THE VIRGIN MURRAY.
[LAUGHTER]
