NATION, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
NATION, I HAVE TO ADDRESS A STORY RIGHT OFF THE BEAN THAT I KNOW MY VIEWERS WILL BE VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT A RECENT STUDY AT OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH FOUND THAT WATCHING LATE NIGHT
TV CAN CAUSE DEPRESSION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EXCEPT FOR CONAN -- WHICH CAUSES POLIO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHAME ON YOU, CONAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RESEARCHERS CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION BY EXPOSING  HAMSTERS TO DIM LIGHT AT NIGHT AND
PICKING UP CHANGES IN THE BRAIN THAT BORE STRIKING SIMILARITIES TO SYMPTOMS IN DEPRESSED PEOPLE.
WELL DONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
INSTEAD OF HAVING PEOPLE WATCH LATE-NIGHT TV, THEN SIMPLY ASKING THEM IF THEY'RE
DEPRESSED, SCIENTISTS EXPOSED.
HAMSTERS TO A DIM LIGHT AND GUESSED HOW THE HAMSTERS FELT.
YOU KNOW, SCIENCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, HOWEVER THEY DID IT, IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY'RE ON TO ME.
THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO COVER IT UP ANYMORE.
NATION, THIS SHOW WAS DESIGNED TO DEPRESS HAMSTERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG.
THAT'S WHY I CREATED MY LONG-RUNNING SEGMENTS "ELUSIVE WATER BOTTLE,"
"THAT WHEEL IS GETTING YOU NOWHERE," AND "THIS WEEK IN DIM LIGHT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
SURE, I ENJOY BRINGING YOU HUMANS MY OPINIONS ON POLITICS AND WORLD AFFAIRS, BUT MY REAL
PASSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN DRIVING HAMSTERS TO SUICIDE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO FOR MY HUMAN VIEWERS, REST ASSURED MY SHOW IS NOT DESIGNED TO DEPRESS YOU AND YOU CAN FEEL
FREE TO KEEP WATCHING.
AND TO MY HAMSTER VIEWERS, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TURN OFF THE TV.
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN A GLASS PRISON FILLED WITH WOOD CHIPS AND YOUR OWN FILTH WITH NO
HOPE OF ESCAPE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
