( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THE
LEADERSHIP OF CHINA WANTS TO DOIS THE AUTHOR OF
"THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFAMNESIA."
PLEASE WELCOME, LOUISA LIM.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
HERE'S THE BOOK, "THE PEOPLE'SREPUBLIC OF AMNESIA."
NOW, LOUISA, WHAT IS HONG KONG?
IS IT PART OF CHINA?
>> YES, IT IS PART OF CHINA.
AND IT WAS A BRITISH COLONY, BUTIN 1997, IT WAS RETURNED TO
CHINESE RULE UNDER THISARRANGEMENT THAT WAS CALLED ONE
COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.
AND NOW WE'RE SEEING A VERY BIGSTRAIN IN THAT ARRANGEMENT.
>> STEPHEN:  WHEN DEMOCRACYCOMES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, I
USUALLY LIKE US TO BOMB IT INTOTHEM.
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOINGTO HAPPEN HERE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TOHAPPEN?
DO YOU THINK THE CHINESE AREGOING TO ROLL THE TANKS IN ON
THE HONG KONG-GEANS?
>> AT THIS POINT IT'S REALLYDIFFICULT TO SAY.
WE'RE SEEING VERY MIXEDMESSAGES.
THE RIOT POLICE WERE WITHDRAWN,BUT THERE WAS AN EDITORIAL IN
THE "PEOPLE'S DAILY" TODAY,WHICH IS THE PARTY MOUTHPIECE,
WHICH SAYS IF PEOPLE DO NOTWITHDRAW FROM THE STREETS, IT
SAID THE ASSEMBLIES WERE WEREILLEGAL AND IF PEOPLE DID NOT
WITHDRAW THE CONSEQUENCES WOULDBE UNIMAGINABLE.
>> STEPHEN:  PERHAPS THEY WILLDO TO THE PROTESTERS WHAT THEY
DID TO THE PIGEONS.
>> WHAT EVERYBODY HAS SAID IS AREWIND OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 1989.
I MEAN, WHAT WE'RE SEEING INTERMS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS
THAT THIS IS ALMOST LIKETIANANMEN 2.0.
>> STEPHEN:  IS ANY OF THISINFORMATION GETTING ON TO THE
MAINLAND OF CHINA?>> IT IS BEING VERY, VERY
HEAVILY CENSORED BECAUSE THEY DONOT WANT TO HAVE-- THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT IS VERY SCARED OFCONTAGION EFFECT.
INSTAGRAM WAS BLOCKED IN CHINA
>> STEPHEN:  INSTAGRAM WASBLOCKED.
>> THE PICTURES-- THE IMAGES OFTENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
PEACEFULLY PROTESTING ARE SUCHPOTENT IMAGES AND THE CHINESE
ARE WORRIED ABOUT CONTAGIONEFFECT.
>> STEPHEN:  I THINK INSTAGRAMALSO HAS A FILTER THAT MAKES
EVERYTHING LOOK LIKE IT WASTAKEN IN TIANANMEN SQUARE IN
1989.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> CHINESE TWITTER HAS ALSO BEEN
VERY HEAVILY CENSORED.
ALL KINDS OF WORDS HAVE BEENBANNED, WORDS LIKE "YELLOW
RIBBONS" BECAUSE THE PROTESTERSARE TYING YELLOW RIBBON AS A
SYMBOL OF DEMOCRACY.
AND EVEN WORDS LIKE "INSTAGRAMIS BLOCKED" IS BLOCKED.
>> STEPHEN:  THE WORDS"INSTAGRAM WAS BLOCKED" IS
BLOCKED.
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE IT WILLSWALLOW ITSELF?
DO YOU THINK THIS COULD SPREAD
TO OTHER AREAS THAT THE CHINESE
CONTROL, LIKE THE U.S. TREASURY?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )GET BACK TO ME ON THAT ONE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LOUISA LIM, "THE PEOPLE'SREPUBLIC OF AMNESIA."
