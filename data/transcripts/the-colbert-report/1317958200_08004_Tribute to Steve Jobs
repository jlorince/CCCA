>> WELCOME BACK, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
DHEERS PLAUS THANK YOU.
FOLKS, AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW
APPLE CO-FOUNDER STEVE JOBS
PASSED AWAY LAST NIGHT.
HE WAS A VISIONARY WHO
CHANGED THE WAY WE USE
COMPUTERS, LISTEN TO MUSIC,
COMMUNICATE AND STAY AWAKE
IN MEETINGS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE THING I WILL MISS IS
THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD MAKE
ME BEG QUITE LIKE HIM, JIM?
>> EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
APPLE'S NEW iPHONE, BUT
NATION, THERE'S SOME VERY
DISTURBING NEWS ABOUT THIS
SO-CALLED REVOLUTIONARY
DEVICE.
I DON'T HAVE ONE YET.
APPLE, WHAT PART OF GIVE ME
A FREE iPHONE DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?
>> THE iPOD 2 IS HERE.
>> OH MY GOD, I NEED IT!
I NEED IT.
GIVE IT TO ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> COME ON, APPLE, GIVE ME
ONE THROUGH THE TV.
I KNOW YOU HAVE THE
TECHNOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, MOST
PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT
KIND OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
YOU CAN TRUST ME ON THAT.
I'M A DOCTOR.
AND IS A TESTAMENT TO STEVE
JOB'S GENEROSITY AND MY
CELEBRITY, THAT EVERYTHING I
ASKED FOR, I GOT.
>> GUESS WHAT, FOLKS.
I GOTS ME ONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHHOO.
>> THE BIG STORY TONIGHT IS,
I HAVE AN iPAD.
>> I GOT THE NEW iPAD 2.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET'S HIT THE INTERNET TO
BUY SOME PETS.COM ON MY NEW
IMAC.
>> YOU KNOW, I STILL HAVE
THAT LIME GREEN IMac.
I HALLOWED IT OUT.
IT IS WHERE I KEEP MY
OBSOLETE iPHONE.
PLUS I WAS THE FIRST
NONAPPLE PERSON TO HAVE AN
iPAD.
AND I GOT TO SHOW IT OFF IN
FRONT OF A GLOBAL AUDIENCE.
>> AND THE NO TEES ARE-- I'M
SORRY, WHERE'S THE LIST.
OH, I KNOW, IT'S ON MY iPAD.
(LAUGHTER)
JAY Z, DID YOU NOT GET ONE
OF THESE IN YOUR GIFT BAG?
AM I COOLER THAN YOU?
WELL, ACCORDING TO MY ARE
YOU COOLER THAN JAY ZI POOPD,
NO, I AM NOT.
THAT WAS A WASTE OF $3.
OKAY.
ALL DAY NEWSMEN HAVE BEEN
QUOTING JOBS INSPIRING
WORDS.
LIKE HIS ENGAGING KEYNOTE
ANNOUNCEMENT, HIS
PHILOSOPHICAL 2005 STANDFORD
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH AND THE
SOARING RHETORIC OF THE
iTUNES TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I
WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
WHO COULD CALL STEVE JOBS A
CLOSE FRIEND.
IN THAT HE COMMUNICATED WITH
ME ONCE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE MORNING AFTER MY GRAMMY
APPEARANCE, I RECEIVED THIS
HIGHLY PERSONAL E-MAIL FROM
THE MAN HIMSELF, THIS IS
TRUEMENT LET ME READ IT TO
YOU OFF THE iPAD THAT, MAY I
REMIND YOU, HE GAVE ME.
FOR FREE.
SUBJECT, LAST NIGHT.
MESSAGE, SWEET, THANKS,
STEVE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY.
REPLY.
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
AND SEND.
