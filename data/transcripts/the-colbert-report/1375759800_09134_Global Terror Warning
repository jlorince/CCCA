[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION...
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: PLEASE, SIT DOWN,
EVERYBODY.
PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING.
FOLKS, NATION, LOCK YOUR DOORS
AND BOARD UP YOUR WINDOWS
BECAUSE AMERICA IS IN A STATE OF
PANIC.
I HOPE YOU'RE WEARING A CLEAN
DIAPER BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT IN COOPERATION WITH
CABLE NEWS HAS ONCE AGAIN TAKEN
US TO CODE BROWN.
JIM?
>> HIGH ALERT.
IS AN ATTACK IMMINENT?
>> AMERICANS HAVE BEEN PUT ON
NOTICE.
THEY MAY NOT BE SAFE THIS MONTH.
>> A GLOBAL TRAVEL ALERT IS NOW
IN EFFECT FOR ALL AMERICANS
AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S AFTER SOURCES SAY THERE'S
GROWING INTELLIGENCE THAT
AL-QAEDA IS PLANNING AN ATTACK.
AS A PRECAUTION, THE U.S. IS
CLOSING 22 EMBASSIES AND
CONSULATES.
>> U.S. OFFICIALS SAY AN ATTACK
COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD AT ANY TIME.
IT COULD HAPPEN LITERALLY AT ANY
MOMENT.
>> Stephen: YES, AN ATTACK IS
IMMINENT, ANY MOMENT, ANYWHERE,
ANY TIME.
LOOK TO YOUR LEFT.
LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT.
BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE COULD BE
TERRORISTS.
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY IN THE
MIDDLE WHO KEEPS LOOKING AROUND
SO MUCH?
WHAT'S HE PLANNING?
FOLKS, THIS WARNING IS EXACTLY
WHY WE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING,
SURRENDERED OUR PRIVACY AND LET
THE N.S.A. TURN THE CONSTITUTION
INTO A CHOOSE YOUR OWN
ADVENTURE.
SO WE CAN GET CONCRETE,
ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE LIKE
THIS.
>> AL QAEDA APPEARS TO BE
PLANNING SOMETHING BIG ALTHOUGH
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT TARGET
OR THE EXACT METHOD.
>> WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE TIME
OR DATE OR TARGET OF ANY ATTACK.
>> WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THE
EXACT DATE, THE EXACT LOCATION
THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR OR THE
NATURE OF IT.
ARE THEY GOING TO ATTACK
EMBASSIES OR HOTELS?
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU N.S.A.
NOW WE KNOW AMERICANS JUST NEED
TO AVOID "THIS" AREA.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOLKS, WITHOUT ANY DETAILS, I'M
NOT EVEN SURE HOW PANICKED I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE.
AT LEAST DURING THE BUSH YEARS I
COULD LOOK AT THIS HELPFUL CHART
AND KNOW THAT MY SPHINCTER
TIGHTNESS WAS ORANGE BUT EVEN
THAT'S GONE NOW BECAUSE OBAMA
GAVE ALL THOSE COLORS TO THE
GAYS FOR THEIR RAINBOW.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY,
NOTHING IS BEING LEFT TO CHANCE.
IN FACT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT
ANNOUNCED THE CLOSED U.S.
EMBASSIES WILL REMAIN SHUT
THROUGH SATURDAY DUE TO AN
ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.
YES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMAIN
ABUNDANTLY CAUTIOUS UNTIL
SATURDAY.
AFTER THAT, THE TERRORISTS WOULD
HAVE TO REBOOK THEIR FLIGHTS.
AND THAT'S A $100 CHANGE FEE.
PLUS THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE OFF
WORK AGAIN AND RESCHEDULE
