(LAUGHTER)SPEAKING OF WATERLESS
MOUNTAIN REGIONS,AFGHANISTAN.
(LAUGHTER)IN THE LAST WEEK THE OBAMA
HAS BEEN ROCKED BY DEFENSESECRETARY ROBERT GATES'S
EXPLOSIVE NEW MEMOIRAVAILABLE WHERE OF COURSE
THEY ARE FREE.
NOW THE BOOK, THE BOOK TAKESDEAD AIM, THE BOOK TAKES
DEAD AIM AT THE PRESIDENT'SHANDLING OF THE AFGHAN WAR.
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DEFENSESECRETARY, QUOTE, PRESIDENT
OBAMA WAS SKEPTICAL, IF NOTOUTRIGHT CONVINCED AT HIS
OWN STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTANWOULD FAIL.
>> FOLKSING I GOT TO SAYIT'S SHOCKING TO HEAR THAT
OBAMA HAS A STRATEGY INAFGHANISTAN.
SURE SEEMS LIKE HE'S FREEBALLING IT.
BUT FOLKS, I'M GOING TO MAKESOME HEADLINES RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO DEFEND THEPRESIDENT'S POLICY IN
AFGHANISTAN BY SAYING IT'SNOT NEARLY AS BAD AS HIS
POLICY IN IRAQ BECAUSE WHILEOBAMA TWID ELS HIS THUMB
IRAQ IS FALL APPROXIMATINGINTO A STATE OF CRIPPLING
VIOLENCE THAT CAN ONLY BEDESCRIBED AS A ROCK, JIM.
>> AL QAEDA EXTREMISTSMAKING SERIOUS GAINS IN
IRAQ'S ANBAR PROVINCE WHEREHUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS
WERE KILLED OR WOUNDEDFIGHTING JIHADIES IN THE
LAST DECADE.
TWO CITIES IN PARTICULAR,FALLUJAH AND RAMADI NOW
SEEING SOME OF THE WORSTFIGHTING SINCE THE IRAQ WAR.
>> I CANNOT BELIEVEPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GIVEN UP
ON IRAQ, CITIES WE CARE SOMEOF ABOUT LIKE FALLUJAH
AND-- HELP ME OUT, RAMADA STHAT IT?
YES, I'M NOT SURPRISED.
I MEAN FOAM PILLOWS THAT ISENOUGH TO MAKE ANYONE STRAP
ON A SUICIDE VEST.
NATION, WE'VE HAD TWO WARSSINCE 9/11 AND OBAMA HAS
REFUSED TO LAUNCH EITHER ONEOF THEM.
LUCKILY, IT'S NOT TOO LATEFOR VICTORY WHICH BRINGS US
TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
FOLKS, OUR PRESIDENT IS THEJOHN MAYER OF WAR.
HE NEVER COMMITS AND AFTERHE LEAVES YOU GET A VIOLENT
FLARE UP IN YOUR TRIBALREGION.
WHICH, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHATIS HAPPENING IN IRAQ.
>> HIS ABANDONMENT OF IRAQLEAD DIRECTLY TO AL QAEDA
TAKING OVER -->> AL QAEDA NOW CONTROLS
WHAT WE FOUGHT SO HARD TOFREE.
>> PRECIOUS BLOOD WASSPILLED AND NATIONAL
TREASURE WAS EXPENDED.
HELPING IRAQIS REMOVE ABRUTAL DICTATOR.
THAT PROGRESS IS NOWTHREATENED.
>> BLACK FLAGS OF AL QAEDAARE FLYING AND THAT'S A
COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL AND YOUMAY SEE THE SAME RESULT IN
AFGHANISTAN AS WE ARE SEEINGIN IRAQ.
>> Stephen: WELL SAID,SENATOR McCAIN.
IF WE LEAVE AFGHANISTAN THATPLACE COULD SINK INTO
WAR-TORN CAY OWES, RIGHT NOWIT IS MERELY BULLET RIDDLED
AN ARCEER.
SO AL QAEDA-- KEEP THIS INMIND, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT,
FOLKS, AL QAEDA WOULDN'THAVE COME BACK IF THE
PRESIDENT HADN'T ABANDONEDIRAQ AFTER A MERE EIGHT
YEARS.
I MEAN I FOR ONE, I FOR ONEWAS SHOCKED, SHOCKED THAT
OBAMA FLEW TO BAGHDAD TO SETA WITHDRAWAL DATE BACK IN
2008 AND EVEN MORE SHOCKEDTHAT HE DID IT WEARING A
PRESIDENT BUSH MASK.
I MEAN THE GUY, THE GUY IS AQUITTER.
IF OBAMA-- (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IF OBAMA HADBEEN AROUND DURING THE 100
YEARS WAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN50 YEARS TOPS.
WELL, I SAY IF IRAQ-- IFIRAQ IS IN CHAOS BECAUSE WE
WITHDREW OUR TROOPS THEN THEOBVIOUS SOLUTION IS TO SEND
OUR TROOPS BACK IN.
RIGHT, SENATOR McCAIN.
>> FIRST OF ALL, NO COMBATTROOPS, OBVIOUSLY.
LET'S GET THAT OUT OF THEWAY.
I WOULD SUGGEST PERHAPSSENDING DAVID PETRAEUS AND
AMBASSADOR CROCKER BACK OVERTHERE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YEAH,DAVID PETRAEUS COULD FIX
THIS THING IF YOU JUST GAVEHIM A TANK ON THE
BATTLEFIELD.
NOW OBAMA-- (LAUGHTER)
I THINK OBAMA MUST DO THIS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT ISIMPORTANT OBAMA HAS TO DO
THIS BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VEBEEN AT WAR IN A PLACE, YOU
ARE ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FORANYTHING THAT EVER HAPPENED
THERE.
THAT IS WHY-- AND I'VE SAIDTHIS BEFORE, THAT IS WHY YOU
MUST NEVER END WARS.
THINK ABOUT THIS.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,THEY'RE NEVER, EVER WOULD
HAVE BEEN A WORLD WAR II IFWE HADN'T STOPPED FIGHTING
WORLD WAR I.
THAT'S JUST MATH.
OR ARE YOU A A FAN OF HITLER,PRESIDENT WILSON.
OR TAKE THAT, OR TAKE THATPUSSY NAPOLEON, HE RETREATS
FROM MOSCOW, PRETTY SOONRASPUTIN, THE COMMIES MOVE
IN, CRUSH CHEF BANGS HISSHOES, THE NEXT THING YOU
KNOW PUTIN IS TOPLESS ANDJOHNNY WEIR CAN'T GO TO THE
OLYMPICS.
AND SOON WHAT'S HAPPENING-- IWARE THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQWILL HAPPEN IN AFGHANISTAN.
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSONTO BLAME FOR THAT, ALEXANDER
THE GREAT.
IN 323 HE CUTS AND RUNS ANDA THOUSAND YEARS LATER ISLAM
IS FOUNDED BOOM, MUSLIMEXTREMISTS.
I AM GOING TO SAY T I'MGOING TO SAY IT, MACEDONIA'S
BEST YEARS ARE BEHIND IT.
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THISSORT OF THING NEVER HAPPENS
AGAIN, PRESIDENT O BAMENTANEEDS TO SEND TROOPS
ANYPLACE WE DON'T WANT BADTHINGS TO HAPPEN TO GOOD
PEOPLE.
THAT IS WHY-- (LAUGHTER)
I AM CALLING FOR A SURGEINTO THE UNSTABLE REGION OF
EVERYWHERE.
-OF-COURSE I'M NOTSUGGESTING ANYTHING
PERMANENT.
OUR PREPARE-- TROOPS WILLLEAVE THE MOMENT THEY ANYONE
WILL HURT EACH OTHER AFTERTHAT.
WE WILL RAKE THE SEAS,IMPRISON THE WIND AND COUNT
EVERY STAR.
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
NOW, WILL IT BE EASY-- (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NO, IT WON'T BEEASY.
BUT ONCE WE'RE FIGHTING INEVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH, AT
LEAST WE CAN NEVER BE DRAWNINTO ANOTHER WAR.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
