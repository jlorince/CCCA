NATION, I'VE LONG WARNED YOUABOUT THE DANGERS OF GLOBAL
WARMING.
MELTING ICE CAPS, RISING SEAS,REUSABLE GROCERY BAGS.
(LAUGHTER)NOW WHAT'S GONNA GET CAUGHT IN
TREES?
AND FOLKS, YESTERDAY, AMERICAGOT ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO OF DOINGSOMETHING.

>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONANNOUNCING STRICT NEW STANDARDS
FOR CARBON EMISSIONS.

REGULATIONS TO TAKE HISSTRONGEST ACTION YET AGAINST
CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> IT'S VERY MUCH SORT OFOBAMACARE FOR THE AIR.
>> Stephen: YES, OBAMACAREFOR THE AIR! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS: GET READY FOR BREATHPANELS.
(LAUGHTER)THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD
REQUIRE STATES TO CUT CARBONDIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM COAL
PLANTS 30% BY 2030.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S GOINGTO BE A 2030.
NO SURPRISE, THE LIBERAL MEDIALOVED THIS MORE EVEN THAN
THEY LOVE BARBARA STREISAND'SGLUTEN-FREE QUINOA WINTER
SOLSTICE DRUM CIRCLE CLEANSE.

(LAUGHTER)NOW, FOLKS, OBAMA CLAIMS HE'S
DOING THIS TO HELP THEENVIRONMENT, BUT WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THIS REALLY IS.
>> OBAMA HAS MADE NO SECRET THATHE HATES COAL AND HE WANTS TO
DESTROY THAT INDUSTRY.
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TOREDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

COAL GENERATES 40% OF AMERICA'SELECTRICITY.
THE REST COMES FROM TRADITIONALSOURCES LIKE OIL, NATURAL GAS
AND RADIO SHACK PLASMA BALLS.
