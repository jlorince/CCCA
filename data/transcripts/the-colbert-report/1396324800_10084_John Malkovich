MADE OF SKY YOU BROUGHT WITH YOUTODAY.
I HAVE TO SAY THE FRIENDLINESSOF THE SUIT MAKES THIS PART MUCH
SCARIER, ALL RIGHT?

ORGANIZERS FROM SUCCEEDING.
WHY PLAY HERO FOR ONCE?
YOU'RE USUALLY THE BAD GUY.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT HAPPENS,YEAH.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TOTHINK OF SOMEONE WHO CAN
CALL RICHARD NIXON ON THEPHONE AS A HERO.
>> Stephen: I AGREE -- ALITTLE BIT.
>> BUT I'M NOT SURE I WOULDCLASSIFY AS HEROIC SOMEONE WHO
SIMPLY DOESN'T WANT TO PAYANYBODY A LIVING WAGE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YEAH.
BUT WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR,OKAY...
THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKETSAYS YOU PAY PEOPLE AS LITTLE AS
YOU POSSIBLY CAN SO YOU CAN MAKEMORE MONEY AND PAY THEM.
OKAY?
(APPLAUSE)MAYBE WE SHOULD EXPLAIN TO THE
PEOPLE THE STORY.
I KNOW THE STORY OF CAESARCHAVEZ BECAUSE I WORKED WITH
THESE LOONS OVER IN THE UNITEDFARM WORKERS ABOUT FOUR YEARS
AGO.
TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT CHAVEZTRIED TO DO TO THE GOOD GRAPE
GROWERS OF CALIFORNIA.
>> WELL, HE TRIED TO ORGANIZETHE UNION, TO PAY PEOPLE AT
LEAST SOMETHING APPROACHING ADOESN'T DAY'S PAY FOR A DECENT
DAY'S WORK --?
MM-HMM.
WHO GETS TO SAY WHAT THAT IS?
CAESAR CHAVEZ.
>> SURE.
AND THINGS LIKE MAYBE GIVE THEMA PLACE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
>> Stephen: IT'S A FIELD, FORGOD'S SAKE
(LAUGHTER)IT'S A FIELD.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE A LITTLECLIP HERE.
JIMMY, ROLL THE CLIP.
>> WHO THE HELL IS THIS CASARCHAVEZ?
>> NOBODY KNOWS.
SOMEBODY SAY HE'S FROM ARIZONA.
WORD IS HE USED TO HANG AROUNDTHE OTHER COUNTIES FROM C.S.O.
IN THE VALLEY STIRRING UPTROUBLE.
I HEARD HE'S MEXICAN.
SEEMS A SAFE BET.
>> Stephen: NOW, CHAVEZ HAD AMOTTO --
(SPANISH)-- IT MEANS "YES, WE CAN."
OBAMA STOLE THAT FROM HIM ANDDIDN'T PAY HIM ANY ROYALTIES, AS
FAR AS I COULD TELL.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
A, ISN'T THAT UNION BUSTING INAND OF ITSELF?
AND, B, WHAT DO YOU THINKOBAMA'S GOALS AND CHAVEZ'S
GOALS, OR THESE EARLY UNIONGOALS, WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN
COMMON?
>> WELL, FIRST, I WOULD SAY THATOBAMA MAYBE COULD HAVE USED A
DIFFERENT PHRASE, SUCH AS "IFYOU LIKE YOUR LETTUCE, YOU CAN
KEEP YOUR LETTUCE."
GRANTED, I MEAN, PROBABLY HESHOULD HAVE PAID FOR IT.
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S AQUESTIONABLE -- LET ME PUT IT TO
YOU THIS WAY -- IF THE WORLDWERE DIFFERENT, AND IF EVERYBODY
HERE'S POSITION WAS REVERSED,AND WE HAD TO CROSS A MEXICAN
BORDER TO FIND WORK, DON'T YOUTHINK IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF
SIMPLE FAIRNESS THAT, IF YOUWORK LIKE THEY DO -- LIKE DOGS
IN THE BLAZING SUN ALL THETIME -- THAT YOU MAKE ENOUGH TO
EAT AND CLOTHE A FAMILY ANDEDUCATE A FAMILY?
(APPLAUSE)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW, IF YOUWANT YOUR LETTUCE, YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR LETTUCE -- CHAVEZ -- THEREWASN'T ENOUGH FOR THEM TO JUST
GET A LIVING WAGE.
THEY HAD TO DENY US OUR LETTUCE.
BECAUSE IN THE '70s -->> BUT ONLY --
>> Stephen: NO, THERE WAS ALETTUCE SHORTAGE.
WILL YOU ADMIT THERE WAS ALETTUCE SHORTAGE IN THE 1970s?
WILL YOU ADMIT IT, YES OR NO,SENATOR?
>> I WILL ONLY SAY THIS, THEYDIDN'T BOYCOTT BIB OR ICEBERG
LETTUCE.
WHY SHOULD WE CARE?
IT WAS ONLY THINGS LIKE ARUGULA(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT.
I APOLOGIZE.
I'M SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUIT.
DID YOU DESIGN THAT?
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE YOUR OWNCLOTHING LINE.
>> I DO.
