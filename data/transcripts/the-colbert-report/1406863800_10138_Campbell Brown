PLEASE WELCOME CAMPBELLBROWN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)CAMPBELL GOOD TO
SEE YOU, THANKS FOR COMINGON.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT HAS BEEN AWHILE.
>> IT AS BEEN AWHILE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE A FORMERANCHOR FOR CNN AND NBC.
SINCE LEAVING TV NEWS YOUHAVE BECOME AN ADVOCATE FOR
SCHOOL CHOICE AND EDUCATIONREFORM. MOST RECENT PROJECT
IS THE PARTNERSHIP FOREDUCATIONAL JUSTICE WHICH FILED
SUIT AGAINST THE STATE OF NEWYORK THIS WEEK CHALLENGING
TEACHER TENURE IN THE PUBLICSCHOOL.
NOW I'M NO FAN OF UNIONS,BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR
GUNS OUT FOR THESE PEOPLE.
IS IT THE SAME REASON I AM?
SO THEY CAN QUIT THEIRLAVISH LIFESTYLE OF THEIR
1983 HONDA CIVICSDRIVING AROUND TOWN?
>> FIRST LET ME CORRECTSOMETHING YOU SAID.
WE'RE NOT FILING THELAWSUIT.
SEVEN PARENTS IN NEW YORKCITY WHO HAVE KIDS IN NEW
YORK STATE WHO HAVE KIDS INPUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BRINGING
THIS LAWSUIT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS YOURROLE, JUST A BUTINSKI?
>> WE'RE HELPING THEM ANDSUPPORTING THEM.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE YOUSUPPORTING THEM, GIVING THEM
MONEY, CASH?
>> NO, WE'RE HELPING THEMFIND LEGAL HELP IN ORDER TO
BRING THEIR CASE.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOTHELPING PAY FOR THE LEGAL
HELP.
>> THE LEGAL HELP IS PROBONO.
>> Stephen: IT'S PRO BONO.
I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.
(LAUGHTER)SORRY, NO HABLA PRO BONO.
>> KIRKLAND & ELLIS IS THE LAWFIRM DOING THE WORK AND THEY'RE
DOING IT FOR FREE, THAT MEANSFOR FREE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO YOU GOT SOME PEOPLE MADAT YOU FOR THIS.
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN VERYOFTEN BUT THERE WERE
PROTESTORS OUTSIDE OF MYSTUDIO TODAY.
>> I HEARD.
>> Stephen: GOING AFTER ACAMPBELL BROWN.
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO UPSETTHESE PEOPLE?
>> WELL, I MEAN THEY'RETRYING TO SILENCE THE DEBATE,
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANTDEBATE THAT WE SHOULD BE
HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> Stephen:  DO THEY NOT HAVETHE RIGHT TO PROTEST?
ARE YOU SILENCING THEPROTEST.
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
BUT I WANT THESE PARENTS TOHAVE A VOICE IN THIS DEBATE
TOO.
AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TODO IS CHANGE A PUBLIC
EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THISCOUNTRY THAT PEOPLE ACROSS
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUMBELIEVE IS IN CRISIS AND
NEEDS TO CHANGE.
>> Stephen: HOW IS IT CRISISIN NEW YORK, WHAT IS THE
PROBLEM HERE.
>> SO IF YOU LOOK AT THEOUTCOMES, STUDENT OUTCOMES
IN NEW YORK, OKAY, SO 91% OFTEACHERS AROUND THE STATE OF
NEW YORK ARE RATED EITHEREFFECTIVE OR HIGHLY
EFFECTIVE AND YET 31%, 31%OF OUR KIDS ARE READING,
WRITING AND DOING MATH ATGRADE LEVEL.
HOW DOES THAT COMPUTE.
HOW YOU CAN ARGUE THE STATUSQUO IS OKAY WITH NUMBERS
LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: I WENT TO PUBLICSCHOOL IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND
31% SOUNDS LIKE A MAJORITYTO ME.
OKAY.
OKAY.
BUT SO WHY ARE WEBLAMING-- WHY ARE WE BLAMING
THE TEACHERS?
MAYBE IT'S THE DUMB KIDS,YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?
KIDS ARE RATED EFFECTIVEMAYBE WE CUT THE KIDS LOOSE
AND PUT THEM BACK IN THEBOBBIN FACTORY.
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLAMINGTEACHERS.
>> Stephen: BLAMING TEACHERS,SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE, THE
TEACHERS UNION, HERE, AREN'TYOU.
>> I AM BLAMING THETEACHER'S UNION BECAUSE THEY
ARE FIGHTING ATTEMPTS TOCHANGE LAWS THAT ARE
ANACHRONISTIC.
>> Stephen: AGAIN, IDON'T --
>> OUTDATED, ANTIQUATED.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THATSOUNDS GOOD.
>> SO YOU KNOW, IT COMESDOWN TO WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES
ARE.
AND IF PUBLIC EDUCATION ISABOUT KIDS, THEN EVERY
DECISION WE MAKE SHOULD BEFOCUSED ON THE QUESTION OF
IS THIS GOOD FOR A CHILD.
AND THAT SHOULD BE THEDRIVING FOCUS AND THE
PRIORITY, WHEN WE DECIDEWHAT OUR POLICIES SHOULD BE
AND WHAT OUR LAWS SHOULD BE.
(APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: THEY'RE GOING TO
CLAP -->> WHAT DO THEY KNOW.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE PLAYINGTHE GOOD FOR CHILD CARD.
OKAY.
IS THIS BASED ON CHILDRENBEING ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO
EQUAL EDUCATION?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THERE WAS A SIMILAR CASE INCALIFORNIA.
AND THE PLAINTIFFS IN THATCASE WON.
AND SOME OF OUR PLAINTIFFSTHE HERE TONIGHT ARE HAPPY TO
BE HERE.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN MENTIONT I WILL EDITED IT OUT BUT
YOU CAN MENTION IT.
THE THING IS AREN'T YOUOPENING A CAN OF WORMS THERE
BECAUSE IF YOU SAY THE KIDSARE ENTITLED TO EQUAL
EDUCATION IF THAT IS YOURARGUMENT, DOESN'T THAT MEAN
EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TOSAY EVERY CHILD IN THE STATE
OF NEW YORK SHOULD HAVE THESAME AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT
ON THEIR EDUCATION?
RICH COMMUNITY, POORCOMMUNITY, POOL IT ALL IN,
SPLIT IT ALL UP AMONG BOBBY ,SUSIE AND BILLY EVERYWHERE.
BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT ISEVERYONE GETS THE SAME
OPPORTUNITY.
>> BUT YOU'RE SUGGESTINGTHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
MONEY.
AND I THINK-- .
>> Stephen: YOU'RESUGGESTING IT'S ABOUT
EQUALITY AND MONEY IS ONE OFTHE EQUATIONS IN EQUALITY OR
HAVE I JUST SCHOOLED YOU?
>> THERE HAVE BEEN MANYCASES BROUGHT TO FIGHT THE
CAUSE THAT ARE YOU BRINGINGUP RIGHT NOW.
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT,BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE
SHOULD BE EQUALITY IN THEMONEY.
I THINK WE SHOULD BE PAYINGTEACHERS MORE.
BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE SHOULDALSO BE TREATING TEACHERS
LIKE PROFESSIONALS,EVALUATING THEM AND TRYING
TO GET AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER INEVERY KID'S
CLASSROOM.
AND ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWSTHAT THE LEAST EFFECTIVE
TEACHERS ARE BEING CENTEREDIN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED
SCHOOLS.
SO THE POOR-- .
>> Stephen: HOW DOES THATWORK OUT.
>> SO WHAT THE TENURE LAWSDO COMBINED WITH DISMISSAL
PROTECTIONS IS MAKE ITIMPOSSIBLE TO FIRE A TEACHER
WHO IS FOUND TO BEINCOMPETENT.
IT TAKES ON AVERAGE 830 DAYSTO FIRE A TEACHER WHO HAS
BEEN FOUND TO BEINCOMPETENT.
>> Stephen: WHO GETS TO SAYWHETHER A TEACHER IS A GOOD
OR BAD TEACHER.
WHO GETS TO MAKE THAT CALL.
>> IT'S A COMBINATION OF THEPRINCIPALS AND THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF, YOUKNOW, YOU HAVE TO EVALUATE.
>> Stephen: PARENTSCOMPLAINING.
>> IF A LOT OF PARENTS ARECOMPLAINING, THERE IS
PROBABLY SOMETHING TO THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF ARE YOUSOMEPLACE WHERE THE PARENTS
DON'T WANT CERTAIN THINGSTAUGHT TO THE KIDS, BECAUSE
I WOULD LOVE MY KIDS NOT TOBE TAUGHT EVOLUTION.
COULD I GET A TEACHER FIREDIF I BELIEVED EVOLUTION
WASN'T A GOOD THING IF THEYDIDN'T HAVE TENURE.
>> THAT IS ONE OF THEARGUMENTS IS THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO LOSE-- .
>> Stephen: I'M IN THE INTHE UNION.
>> THEY ARE GOING TO LOSEDUE PROCESS IF WE CHANGE
THESE LAWS BUT THAT'S SIMPLYNOT TRUE.
EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO DUEPROCESS AND A RIGHT TO A
FAIR HEARING.
IT'S VERY HARD TO ARGUE THATA LAW THAT MAKES TEACHER
LAYOFF DECISIONS OREMPLOYMENT DECISIONS SOLELY
BASED ON SENIORITY IS THERIGHT THING TO DO.
WHEN YOU HAVE THE TEACHER OFTHE YEAR IN CALIFORNIA BEING
LAID OFF AND A TEACHER WHOHAS BEEN FOUND TO BE
INCOMPETENT KEEPING THEIRJOB.
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THEKIDS?
I GET THAT YOU WANT TODEFEND TEACHERS.
AND NOBODY WANTS TO ATTACKTEACHERS.
>> Stephen: I DON'T REALLYWANT TO DEFEND TEACHERS OR
UNIONS, I MOSTLY JUST WANTTO ATTACK YOU.
JUST TRYING TO WIN,CAMPBELL.
>> WHY.
>> Stephen: JUST TRYING TOWIN, ALL RIGHT.
YOUR ORGANIZATION, WHEREDOES ITS MONEY COMES FROM.
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGSTHEY ASKED ME TO ASK YOU.
>> I SAW THAT ON MY TWITTERFEED TODAY.
WHO IS FUNDING THIS EFFORT?
>> Stephen: WHO IS FUNDINGYOUR EFFORT.
>> KIRKLAND ELLIS, THE LAWFIRM.
>> Stephen: THE LAW FIRM ISFUNDING IT.
>> THE LAW FIRM IS DOINGTHIS FOR FREE SO WE HAVEN'T
GONE OUT TO RAISE MONEY.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVEN'TRAISED ANY MONEY.
>> I'M GOING IT TO BERAISING LOTS OF MONEY
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TRYTO BRING-- .
>> Stephen: AFTER THIS, THECOLBERT BUMP, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ROLLING IN IT.
(APPLAUSE)>> BUT WE WANT THIS TO BE,
WE WANT THIS TO BE ANATIONAL EFFORT.
WE WANT TO HELP PARENTS INSTATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
WHO WANT TO DO SIMILARTHINGS.
>> Stephen: SO ITSPARTNERSHIP FOR EDUCATIONAL
JUSTICE HAS NOT RAISED ANYMONEY SO FAR.
>> YEAH, WE ARE RAISINGMONEY.
>> Stephen: WHO DID YOURAISE IT FROM.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO REVEALTHE DONORS.
>> Stephen: I RESPECT THATBECAUSE I HAVE HAD A SUPER
PAC.
>> I HEAR YOU.
BUT PART OF THE REASON ISTHE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE
TODAY TRYING TO PROTEST,TRYING TO SILENCE OUR
PARENTS WHO WANT TO HAVE AVOICE.
>> Stephen: EXERCISING THEFIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BUT THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO GOAFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE FUNDING
THIS.
AND I THINK THIS IS A GOODCAUSE AND AN IMPORTANT
CAUSE.
AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TOCONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAUSE
WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT THEIRNAME ON IT, SO THEY BECOME A
TARGET OF THE PEOPLE WHO AREOUTSIDE EARLIER TODAY, THEN
I RESPECT THAT.
>> Stephen: WELL, I RESPECTYOU.
(LAUGHTER)I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO I WOULD RESPECT AT THISTABLE.
AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFTBUT YOU.
CAMPBELL, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR JOINING US.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: CAMPBELL BROWN,PARTNERSHIP FOR EDUCATIONAL
JUSTICE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
