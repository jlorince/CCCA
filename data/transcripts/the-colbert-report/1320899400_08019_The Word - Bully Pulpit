CONSPIRACY.
AND HERMAN CAIN ISN'T THE ONLY
ONE BEING BULLIED IN AMERICA.
BULLIES ARE ALSO A MENACE IN OUR
SCHOOLS AND I WILL NOT STAND FOR
IT.
IN FACT, IF I CATCH SOMEONE
BULLYING, I TWIST THEIR NIPPLE
UNTIL IT'S SWOLLEN AND PURPLE AS
A PLUM, YANK THEIR SHIRT UP OVER
THEIR HEAD THEN SHOVE THEM INTO
THE GIRLS BATHROOM.
BECAUSE IT'S GOTTA STOP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT SOMETIMES, WELL-MEANING
PEOPLE GO TOO FAR.
CASE IN POINT: 47 STATES HAVE
PASSED RESTRICTIVE ANTI-BULLYING
LEGISLATION.
AND THESE LAWS JUST REPLACE THE
SCHOOLYARD BULLY WITH THE BULLY
OF BIG GOVERNMENT.
THANKFULLY, ONE STATE HAS FOUND
A WAY TO ACT AS A BIG BROTHER TO
OUR KIDS WITHOUT BECOMING BIG
BROTHER AND IT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S WORD:
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BULLY PULPIT.
THE MICHIGAN SENATE JUST PASSED
"MATT'S SAFE SCHOOL LAW," NAMED
FOR TEENAGER MATT EPPLING, WHO
TRAGICALLY COMMITTED SUICIDE IN
2002 AFTER BEING TORMENTED BY
CLASSMATES FOR BEING GAY.
IT REQUIRES EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL
ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT A POLICY
PROHIBITING BULLYING BY PUPILS
AT SCHOOL.
NOW, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JUST AND
FITTING TRIBUTE TO AN INNOCENT
VICTIM.
BUT GARY GLENN, PRESIDENT OF THE
AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION OF
MICHIGAN, TOLD "TIME" MAGAZINE
WHAT IT REALLY IS "A TROJAN
HORSE FOR THE HOMOSEXUAL
AGENDA."
[ LAUGHTER ]
YES, IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT THE
HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA IS AN
INSIDIOUS PLOT TO PREVENT GAY
TEENAGERS FROM DYING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT TROJANS WERE REALLY
GAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THIS LAW CLEARLY ASSOCIATES
BEING ANTI-BULLY WITH BEING
PRO-GAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT VIOLATES THE FREE SPEECH OF
CHRISTIANS WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING
TO FOLLOW LEVITICUS:
"IF A MAN HAS SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH A MAN AS ONE DOES WITH A
WOMAN, BOTH OF THEM HAVE DONE
WHAT IS DETESTABLE.
THEY ARE TO BE PUT TO DEATH."
THAT'S NOT ME, THAT'S GOD.
THE ALL-KNOWING, ALL-LOVING
CREATOR WHO MADE ALL THINGS AND
HATES SOME OF THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT UNDER THESE ANTI-BULLYING
LAWS, IF A CHRISTIAN JOCK
YELLED, "YOU'RE DAMNED TO HELL,
YOU QUEER," HE COULD GET
SUSPENDED AND MISS THE BIG GAME!
THEN HE WON'T GET TO TACKLE ALL
THOSE SWEATY GUYS IN TIGHT
PANTS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK GOODNESS, MICHIGAN SENATE
REPUBLICANS STEPPED IN, PANTSED
THAT LAW AND STUFFED IT IN A
LOCKER BY ADDING AN EXEMPTION
THAT STATES.
"THIS SECTION DOES NOT PROHIBIT
A STATEMENT OF A SINCERELY HELD
RELIGIOUS BELIEF OR MORAL
CONVICTION."
THAT'S TOO COMPLICATED.
TELL THEM WHAT THIS MEANS NEWS
DORK!
>> THE BILL ALSO GIVES STUDENTS
LICENSE TO BULLY BASED ON
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS."
>> Stephen: HA! HA!
NICE REPORT, LEZBO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE POINT IS, BULLYING IS FINE
AS LONG AS YOU GET A PERMISSION
SLIP FROM GOD.
NOW WITH THIS AMENDMENT TO THE
LAW,
NOW IF YOU'RE A MICHIGAN
CHRISTIAN TEENAGER CAUGHT GIVING
A GAY KID A SWIRLIE, YOU CAN SAY
IT'S A BAPTISM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AFTER ALL, IF YOU READ THE
BIBLE, YOU KNOW JESUS WAS A
BULLY.
HE THREW THE MONEY LENDERS FROM
THE TEMPLE-- BECAUSE THEY WERE
THE MATHLETES!
LOOK AT HIM AT THE CAFETERIA.
HANGING OUT AT THE COOL KIDS
TABLE.
"NO, THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR THESE
TWELVE GUYS, GO SIT SOMEWHERE
ELSE,YOU PHARISEES."
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN THOUGH CLEARLY THERE'S TONS
OF SPACE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE TABLE!
BY THE WAY, CHRISTIAN TEENS
DON'T HAVE TO RESTRICT THEIR
RIGHTEOUS BULLYING TO GAYS.
ACCORDING TO LEVITICUS THEY
SHOULD ALSO TORMENT THEIR
CLASSMATES WHO HAVE TATTOOS,
WEAR "CLOTHING WOVEN OF TWO
KINDS OF MATERIAL" OR ARE GIRLS
IN THEIR TIME OF MENSTRUAL
IMPURITY.
AND DON'T JUST BULLY THOSE
GIRLS, BULLY ANYONE WHO TOUCHES
THEM, FOR THEY ARE UNCLEAN.
AND REMAIN UNCLEAN UNTIL THE
GIRL GIVES THE PRINCIPAL
TWO TURTLES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS
TO BE SACRIFICED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
CHRISTIANS HERE.
WE CAN'T HAVE HINDUS, JEWS AND
MUSLIMS BULLYING US ABOUT HAVING
BURGERS, BACON AND BOOZE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH
THIS AMENDMENT.
IT ALSO ALLOWS BULLYING BASED ON
SINCERELY HELD MORAL CONVICTION.
AND THERE MAY BE SOME WHO ARE
CONVINCED THAT BY INSERTING INTO
A LAW WRITTEN TO PREVENT THE
SUICIDES OF TORMENTED GAY
CHILDREN AN AMENDMENT THAT
JUSTIFIES THAT CRUELTY BY
APPEALING TO GOD, THESE
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE BEING
IMMORAL.
AND I JUST WORRY THAT NEXT
NOVEMBER THOSE VOTERS MIGHT PICK
ON THEM.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
