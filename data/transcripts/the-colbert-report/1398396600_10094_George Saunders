>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ANAWARD-WINNING AUTHOR WITH A NEW
BOOK ABOUT THE VIRTUES OFKINDNESS.
WHICH MEANS I GET TO YELL AT HIMAND HE'S JUST GOING TO SIT
THERE.
PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE SAUNDERS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
HEY, GEORGE, GOOD TO SEE YOUAGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  FOR THOSE WHODON'T KNOW YOU'RE A McCARTHUR
GRANT RECEIVEEE AND ABESTSELLING AUTHOR.
AND A NEW ONE IS CALLED--CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY,
IT'S SOME THOUGHTS ON KINDNESS.
THIS STARTED OFF AS A SPEECH YOUGAVE AT SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, A
COMMENCEMENT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  SO SELL ME ONKINDNESS.
( LAUGHTER )IT GETS GREAT PRESS.
IT GETS GREAT PRESS, OKAY.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, GOT A GREATPUBLICIST.
WHAT'S IN KINDNESS FOR ME?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THESPEECH, I WAS KIND OF BLANKED
OUT.
I THOUGHT YOU HAVE A ROOM FULLOF YOUNG KIDS THAT ARE
IMPATIENT.
WHAT CAN I SAY THAT'S REALLYURGENT?
I LOOKED BACK AND SAID IN ALL MYLIFE WHAT DO I REGRET?
AND THERE WASN'T THAT MUCHACTUALLY.
( LAUGHTER )NO, LIKE THE LITTLE
HUMILIATIONS-- YOU CAN FORGO ALLTHAT.
BUT THERE WERE A HAND FULL OFTHINGS THEY REALLY REGRETTED AND
THEY ALL HAD TO DO WITH MOMENTSWHERE SOMEBODY NEEDED ME TO BE
KIND TO THEM OR STEP UP AND IDIDN'T FOR WHATEVER REASON.
SO I WROTE ABOUT ONE PARTICULARGIRL IN OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASS
WHO WAS KIND OF AN OUTCAST.
>> AND TRIED TWO OR THREE TIMESTO HELP HER AND THEN I KIND OF
CHICKENED OUT. I HAD THAT FEELING WHEN SOMEBODY IS
DROWNING AND YOU GO TO HELP ANDYOU GO THIS COULD GET UGLY.
AND I KIND OF BAILED ON HER.
>> Stephen:  I'VE NEVERACTUALLY DONE THAT TO SOMEONE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I RECOMMEND IT.
NO, NO, NO.
BUT-- SO SHE WAS KIND OF A NICEGIRL, AND AT THAT TIME I WAS A
PRETTY STRONG CATHOLIC, AND IIDENTIFIED CLOSELY WITH THAT
KIND OF 70s IDEA OF JESUS ASBEING SO COMPASSIONATE THAT HE
WAS COMFORTABLE ANYWHERE.
AND I THOUGHT, YEAH, I COULD DOTHAT.
>> Stephen:  DID YOU HELP HEREVER?
>> WELL, I TRIED.
I SORT OF MADE A FEW ATTEMPTS,BUT YOU COULD SEE THIS HAD
PROBABLY HAPPENED TO HER BEFOREIN OTHER SCHOOLS, AND SHE WAS A
LITTLE LEERY AND REALLY WASN'TTHAT EAGER TO BE HELPED.
SO AT THAT POINT, AT SOME POINTI JUST SAID, YEAH, I'M NOT GOING
TO DO THAT.
AND I COULD SORT OF FEEL MYSELF FALLING AWAY FROM THAT IDEA
OF JESUS I HAD IN MY MIND WHICHI THINK IS WHY I REMEMBERED IT
ALL THESE YEARS LATER.
>> Stephen:  SO YOU REGRETTHAT VERY MUCH.
HOW DID MIDDLE SCHOOL GO FORYOU.
>> PRETTY GOOD.
>> Stephen:  SO ( BLEEP ) HER.
NO, NO, LISTEN, BUT IT'S AJUNGLE OUT THERE IN MIDDLE
SCHOOL.
IT'S A JUNGLE.
IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED.
I MEAN, HERE'S MY-- HERE'S MYPROBLEM WITH YOUR-- WITH
KINDNESS, GEORGE.
IF EVERYONE TRIES TO BE KIND,OKAY-- LET'S SAY WE ALL TRY TO
BE KIND, AND ONE GUY STAYS ADICK, OKAY, WE'RE ALL SUCKERS.
AND HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF US.
OKAY?
I FOR ONE DON'T WANT TO GET TOST. PETER AT THE PEARLY GATE AND
SAY, "OH, YEAH, YOU WERE KIND TOPEOPLE BUT YOU WERE A SUCKER AND
SOMEBODY ABUSED FOOD STAMPS.
GO TO HELL."
>> YOU MAKE A GOOD CASE.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU.
>> I WAS COMING HERE TO PROMOTETHE KINDNESS BOOK AND I WAS ON
THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE AND IGET TO THE TOLLBOOTH AND I GET
INTO THAT LITTLE THING, THATLITTLE KIND OF-- AND THE GUY
COMES OUT AND DROPS A CONE RIGHTIN FRONT OF MY CAR.
>> Stephen:  A COMB?
>> A CONE.
AND HE SAID, "YOU GOTTA GOBACK."
SO I LOOKED BACK AND IT'SFREEZING RAIN.
IT'S NIGHT.
THE CARS ARE, LIKE, SIX OR SEVENCARS ARE BEHIND ME.
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, INVOKEKINDNESS.
SO I JUMP OUT OF THE CAR AND IGO UP TO HIM AND SAY IN MY BEST
NEW AGE VOICE, "SIR, I'M NOTSURE THIS IS THE BEST DECISION
GIVEN THE CONDITIONS."
AND HE GOES, "I DON'T GIVE ACRAP.
I'M GOING HOME."
SO I THOUGHT THIS IS A-- YOUKNOW, A REALLY GOOD KINDNESS
CASE.
I SAID, "IF YOU DON'T MIND, ITHINK IT'S NOT EVEN IN YOUR
INTEREST."
HE SAID, "I'M GOING HOME."
AND HE WALKED OFF.
SO THAT'S A CASE WHERE I-- WHATI WANTED TO DO --
>> Stephen:  HE DROPPED THECONE IN FRONT OF YOU IT WASN'T
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, WAS IT?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIM.
>> Stephen:  SO BEING NICE ISNOT KIND.
>> IN THAT MOMENT I WANTED TOSAY SOMETHING REALLY CUTTING TO
HIM.
>> Stephen:  WHAT WOULD YOUHAVE SAID?
>> I CAN'T THINK OF IT BECAUSEI'M SO KIND.
( LAUGHTER )YOU.
>> Stephen:  TEACH AT SYRACUSEUNIVERSITY.
>> Stephen:  I DO.
DO YOU HAVE TENURE?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen:  WHY ARE YOU KINDSTILL?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE KINDANYMORE?
YOU COULD BE A COMPLETE MONSTERAND NO ONE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO
YOU.
>> I HAVE THE SWEETEST STUDENTSEVER-- WHY NOT BE NICE?
>> Stephen:  YOU SAY BECOMINGKINDER HAPPENS NATURALLY WITH
AGE.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN GRUMPY OLDMEN?
>> YEAH, I--( LAUGHTER )
I GOT A FEW E-MAILS-- "YOUSHOULD MEET MY FATHER-IN-LAW.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RETALKING ABOUT."
FOR ME I THINK WHAT HAPPENS ISYOU GET OLDER, YOU HAVE LESS
ENERGY.
SO IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TOMAINTAIN YOUR NEUROSES AND
HATRED.
I THINK AS YOU GET OLDER YOU'RELIKE I WISH I COULD STILL BE
HATEFUL, BUT I'M TOO TIRED.
( LAUGHTER )YOU HAVE KIDS.
AND YOU SEE THE WAY THE WORLDWORKS ON PEOPLE AND I THINK
YOU-- I THINK ACTUALLY THE DUSTKIND OF SETTLES.
IN MY EXPERIENCE YOU SORT OF SEETHAT LEARNING TO BECOME MORE
SYMPATHETIC AND LOVING ACTUALLYIS REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
ALL THE OTHER STUFF OF KIND OFJUST DUST, YOU KNOW?
>> Stephen:  THE CENTRALMESSAGE TO STUDENTS IS STRIVE
FOR KINDNESS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  IS THAT BECAUSETHAT'S MORE REALISTIC FOR
GRADUATING SENIORS RIGHT NOWTHAN STRIVING FOR JOBNESS?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
( CHEERS )>> IT GIVES THEM SOMETHING TO DO
WHILE WAITING FOR THEIRREJECTION LETTER.
>> Stephen:  OR WAITINGTABLES.
WHEN HAS KINDNESS WORKED FORYOU?
>> FOR ME.
>> Stephen:  WHEN DID IT PAYOFF?
IT DIDN'T PAY OFF FOR THE GUYWITH THE CONES.
>> NOT SO MUCH.
>> Stephen:  THE GIRL INMIDDLE SCHOOL.
>> YOU SHOULD SEE THE THINGS ILEFT OUT OF THE SPEECH.
THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN AGRADUATION BUZZ-KILL.
DON'T KILL A GUY.
>> Stephen:  DID YOU KILLSOMEONE?
>> NO.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, BUT THAT'SOUT THERE NOW.
WHEN HAS KINDNESS WORKED FORYOU, GEORGE?
>> IT WORKED WHEN I WAS THERECIPIENT OF IT.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.
THE MESSAGE IS BE KIND BECAUSEI'M RIGHT HERE.
( LAUGHTER )IF YOU CAN THINK OF ONE TIME YOU
WERE A NICE GUY, PLEASE COMEBACK.
GEORGE SAUNDERS.
IT'S A GREAT BOOK.
IT'S A WONDERFUL SPEECH.
IT'S CALLED "CONGRATULATIONS."
BUY IT FOR EVERY GRADUATE.
