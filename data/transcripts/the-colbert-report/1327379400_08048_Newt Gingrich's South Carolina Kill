WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A
GREAT WEEKEND.
I SURE DID.
DOWN IN MY HOME STATE OF
SOUTH CACKALACKY.
MORE ON THAT SHORTLY.
BUT FIRST LET'S GET TO THE
PRIMARY.
NEWT GINGRICH CRUSHED MITT
ROMNEY ON SATURDAY.
AFTER DISAPPOINTING SHOWINGS
IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE,
NEWT'S CAMPAIGN LOOKED
TERMINALLY ILL WHICH IS
GENERALLY WHEN HE MOVES ON
TO SOMETHING BETTER.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW NEWT, NEWT TRIUMPHS WITH
40% OF THE VOTE TO MITT
ROMNEY'S 28%.
A GAP SO WIDE YOU COULD FIT
NEWT'S HEAD IN IT.
(LAUGHTER)
AND GINGRICH SEALED HIS
VICTORY IN LAST WEEK'S
DEBATE BY GOING AFTER
AMERICA'S MOST DANGEROUS
ENEMY, DEBATE MODERATORS.
FIRST ON MONDAY HE LAID THE
SMACKDOWN ON JUAN WILLIAMS.
>> SPEAKER, GINGRICH, YOU
RECENTLY SAID BLACK
AMERICANS SHOULD DEMAND JOBS,
NOT FOOD STAMPS.
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT THIS IS
VIEWED AT A MINIMUM AS
INSULTING TO ALL AMERICANS
BUT PARTICULARLY TO BLACK
AMERICANS.
>> NO.
I DON'T SEE THAT.
>> Stephen: WHOOO!
NO.
HE DOESN'T SEE THAT, JUAN
WILLIAMS.
WHICH YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
IF YOU AND YOUR HOMEBOYS
WEREN'T SO HIGH FROM SMOKING
FOOD STAMPS.
THEN, I SAID T I KNOW.
THEN AT THURSDAY'S DEBATE
NEWT FEASTED ON THE FLESH OF
JOHN KING.
>> YOUR EX-WIFE GAVE AN
INTERVIEW TO ABC NEWS.
SHE SAYS YOU ASKED HER, SIR,
TO ENTER INTO AN OPEN
MARRIAGE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE SOME
TIME TO RESPOND TO THAT.
>> NO, BUT I WILL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT IS A SUBJECT OF
CONVERSATION ON THE CAMPAIGN.
I GET YOUR POINT, I TAKE
YOUR POINT.
>> JOHN T WAS REPEATED BY
YOUR NETWORK.
YOU CHOSE TO START DEBATE
WITH IT.
DON'T TRY TO BLAME SOMEBODY
ELSE.
YOU AND YOUR STAFF CHOSE TO
TART THIS DEBATE WITH IT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AFTER A KILL--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AFTER A KILL THAT BIG NEWT
