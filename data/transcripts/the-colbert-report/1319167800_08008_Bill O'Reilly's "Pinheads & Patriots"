>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, WITH THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN STRETCHING INTO ITS
11th YEAR, IT CAN BE EASY TO
FORGET TO THANK THE PEOPLE
WORKING SO HARD TO PROTECT OUR
COUNTRY.
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT
BILL O'REILLY.
FOR YEARS, PAPA BEAR HAS BEEN
SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS BY SENDING
THEM WHAT THEY MOST DESPERATELY
NEED ON THE BATTLEFIELD-- HIS
BOOK.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM.
>> WE'VE BEGUN OUR BOOKS FOR THE
TROOPS PROGRAM, IF YOU BUY A
COPY, MY PUBLISHER HARPER
COLLINS WILL SEND A COPY TO THE
TROOPS, ALSO DONATE A BUCK TO
THE WOUNDED WARRIORS FOUNDATION
FOR EACH BOCK SOLD.
I WILL MATCH IT, SO EVERYBODY
WINS, UNLESS YOU HATE THE BOOK,
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BUT
LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY WOULD.
IT IS A PERFECT GIFT FOR THESE
WARRIORS.
I KNOW READING HIS BOOKS ALWAYS
MAKE ME WANT TO KILL SOMEBODY.
(LAUGHTER)
SO FOLKS, I WAS SHOCKED TO
THE CORE TO SEE THIS PHOTO
ANONYMOUSLY POSTED ONLINE BY A
SOLDIER SERVING IN AFGHANISTAN,
OF A BIG PILE OF THE BOOK BEING
BURNED WITH THE CAPTION, "SOME
JERK SENT US TWO BOXES OF THIS
AWFUL BOOK INSTEAD OF ANYTHING
SOLDIERS IN REMOTE OUTPOSTS IN
AFGHANISTAN MIGHT NEED LIKE SAY
FOOD OR SOAP."
(APPLAUSE)
YEAH, THAT GOT ME CLAPPING WITH
ANGER, TOO.
FIRST OF ALL, SOLDIER, THERE ARE
PLENTY OF WAYS PAPA BEAR'S BOOKS
CAN BE USEFUL ON THE FRONT LINE.
YOU CAN USE THEM AS SANDBAGS, OR
AS ARMOR FOR A HUMVEE, OR YOU
KNOW, YOU GUYS ALWAYS NEED
TOILET PAPER.
I AM SURE BILL WOULD BE HONORED.
NOW, ONCE THIS PHOTO WENT VIRAL,
THE SOLDIER CLAIMS HE WAS NOT
BURNING THE BOOKS FOR POLITICAL
REASONS BUT BECAUSE "WE DON'T
HAVE A POST OFFICE HERE, SO
SENDING THEM BACK WASN'T AN
OPTION.
ALL WASTE IS BURNED ON THE BASE.
I WON'T SAY I DIDN'T TAKE
PLEASURE IN REMOVING A FEW
COPIES OF THIS BIGOTED TWERP'S
WRITING FROM CIRCULATION, BUT
THE REASON FROM DOING SO WAS A
MILITARY NECESSITY."
(APPLAUSE)
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOUR EXCUSE WAS I WAS JUST
FOLLOWING ORDERS.
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?
THAT'S WHY IT'S TIME FOR MY
LONG-RUNNING SEGMENT, 'PINHEADS
AND PATRIOTS."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TONIGHT'S PATRIOT BILL O'REILLY
FOR SENDING OUR TROOPS HIS BOOK.
TONIGHT'S PINHEAD, WHOEVER DID
THIS.
HOW DARE YOU, SIR?
YOU SIT THERE THOUSANDS OF MILES
FROM THE FRONT LINES OF
PUNDITRY, LOBBING YOUR
CRITICISMS FROM THE SAFETY OF
YOUR FORWARD OPERATING BASE,
ATTACKING A HERO WHO GETS UP
EVERY DAY, PUTS ON THIS UNIFORM,
AND HEADS INTO BASIC CABLE HELL.
ALL OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY AND A
LUCRATIVE BROADCASTING CONTRACT.
IT JUST MAKES ME SICK TO SEE
TROOPS LIKE YOU USE PUNDITS AS A
TOOL TO PUSH YOUR OWN POLITICAL
AGENDA.
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU, SIR,
ARE A PINHEAD WHO I
UNQUESTIONABLY SUPPORT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
