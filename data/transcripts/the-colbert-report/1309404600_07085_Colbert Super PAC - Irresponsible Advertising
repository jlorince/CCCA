NATION, I'LL JUST KEEP THIS DOWN
HERE.
NATION, THE 2012 ELECTION IS
GOING TO BE HISTORIC.
YEARS FROM NOW, AMERICANS WILL
LOOK BACK AND SAY,  "AIYA!
JI-SHEH JI-YO LEE-SHEH EE-EE
DUH. SHEN-ZAY HUEY-CHU
KUAHNG-KUNG, FOO-CHING SUO-YO
ZAI-WU."
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, IT'S ALL THE MORE
HISTORIC BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME
COURT'S
CITIZENS UNITED RULING, WHICH
ALLOWED THE CREATION OF SUPER
PACS, POLITICAL ACTION
COMMITTEES THAT CAN TAKE
UNLIMITED CORPORATE AND UNION
CASH TO CREATE POLITICAL ADS.
MONTHS AGO I ANNOUNCED MY PLANS
TO SET UP COLBERT SUPER PAC.
OUR MOTTO:  MAKING A BETTER
TOMORROW, TOMORROW.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, WHEN YOU GOOGLE THE
PHRASE SUPER PAC,
I'M THE FIRST FIVE RESULTS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT BREAKS MY PREVIOUS RECORD
OF THE FIRST FOUR RESULTS FROM
GOOGLING THE PHRASE "PEAR-SHAPED
PUNDIT."
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE I BROUGHT THEM TO THE
NATION'S ATTENTION IN APRIL, 17
NEW SUPER PACS HAVE BEEN
CREATED, INCLUDING "TURN RIGHT
USA."
WHO HAVE RELEASED SOME GREAT
ADS.
INCLUDING ONE THAT MAKES SOME
SALIENT POINTS ABOUT
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE JANICE
HAHN.
>> IN AN INSANE EFFORT TO REDUCE
GANG VIOLENCE, JANICE HAHN HIRED
HARDCORE GANG MEMBERS WITH
TAXPAYER MONEY TO BE GANG
INTERVENTION SPECIALISTS.
SHE EVEN HELPED THEM GET OUT OF
JAIL SO THEY COULD RAPE AND KILL
AGAIN.
♪♪
>> GIVE ME YOUR CASH, BITCH, SO
WE CAN SHOOT UP THE STREET.
GIVE ME YOUR CASH, BITCH, SO WE
CAN BUY SOME MORE HEAT.
GIVE ME YOUR CASH, HO, SO WE CAN
GET OUT THE--
GIVE ME YOUR CASH, HO, COS WE
UH!
>> Stephen: I KNOW THAT AD MAY
SEEM RACIST, BUT IF YOU LOOK
PAST THE RACISM, THERE'S ALSO A
REAL MESSAGE OF MISOGYNY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT TO THE WEAK MINDED, THAT AD
IS VERY EFFECTIVE.
FOR INSTANCE, THEY GOT ME TO
PLAY IT ON NATIONAL TV.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS WHY I WANT MY OWN PAC,
TO MAKE ADS LIKE THIS ONLY LESS
RESPONSIBLE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, I MAY GET WHAT I
WANT.
BECAUSE TOMORROW AT 10 A.M THE
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
WILL RULE ON WHETHER OR NOT I
CAN HAZ SUPER PAC.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
YEP!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S ALL IN THE HANDS OF THE
FEC.
JIMMY, CAN WE SEE THE
COMMISSIONERS?
NO, JIMMY, I DIDN'T SAY
ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH MODELS, I
SAID THE FEC.
[LAUGHTER]
OH, THAT'S THEM?
DAMN THEY'RE GOOD-LOOKING. MY
SUBCOMMITTEE JUST FILLED THE
ENTIRE CHAMBER.
[LAUGHTER]
TOMORROW, I'LL BE AT FEC
HEADQUARTERS -- 999 E STREET
NORTH WEST -- TO ANSWER THEIR
QUESTIONS.
AFTER THE HEARING, LET'S SAY,
ELEVEN-ISH, I WILL MEET YOU ALL
IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING TO
ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS AND CHART A
NEW COURSE FOR THE COLBERT
NATION.
BE THERE.
AND THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE
CASH.
I WILL ALSO A
