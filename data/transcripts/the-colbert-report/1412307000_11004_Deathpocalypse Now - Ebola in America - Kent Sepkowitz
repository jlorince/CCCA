WHAT DO YOU MEAN ZERO?
WHAT YOU MEAN ZERO?
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. THE PRESIDENT SAID IT'S
UNLIKELY WE'RE GOING TO GET ANOUTBREAK OF EBOLA IN THE UNITED

AND NOW HE'S TURNED OUT TO BEWRONG.
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE RIGHTERTHAN THE PRESIDENT?

YOU SAID ZERO PERCENT.
YOU'RE GOING IN THE OTHERDIRECTION.
THE PROOF IS WE HAVE IT NOW INAMERICA.
>> WE HAVE ONE CASE NOW.
THERE IS ACTUAL SCIENCE BEHINDTHIS.
THIS IS NOT RUMOR ANDPUNDITOCRACY DOING THIS.
THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES.
WE HAVE HAD 20 OUTBREAKS OFEBOLA IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.
>> Stephen: NEVER ONE THISBAD.
>> NEVER ONE THIS BAD.
WE KNOW HOW IT'S TRANSMITTED.
WE EVEN KNOW HOW IT'STRANSMITTED IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
IN THE HOUSEHOLD IT'S NOT EVENTHAT CONTAGIOUS, AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU HAVE A SICK MOM OR DAD ANDTHERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS.
ONE IN SEVEN FAMILY MEMBERSCOMES DOWN WITH EBOLA, EVEN IN
THAT CLOSE CONFINE.

TO SOMEONE WHO IS BLEEDING TODEATH WOULD BE MY MAIN ADVICE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEAMOUNT OF VIRUS IN BLOOD IS SKY
HIGH IN SOMEONE WHO ISINFECTIOUS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> AND THE ONLY WAY TO GETINFECTED IS TO TOUCH THAT BLOOD
BARE HANDED OR SMEAR IT ON YOURFACE WHICH MAYBE YOU WOULD BE
INCLINED TO DO.
I DON'T KNOW.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen: IT DEPENDS ON HOWGOOD THE PARTY IS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> BUT I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH
WE'VE HAD A SEVEN-MONTHOUTBREAK, YOU KNOW, NUMBERING
NOW IN 7,000-PLUS CASES, THIS ISNOT THAT CONTAGIOUS A DISEASE
WHICH I KNOW ALL OF US KEEPSAYING?
>> Stephen: THE PRETTY LADY ONTV SAID NO CURE.
>> NO CURE.
>> Stephen: OKAY?
IS THERE NO CURE FOR THIS?
>> THE BODY'S OWN IMMUNE SYSTEMIS THE ONLY CURE.
THERE IS NOT AN APPROVED DRUG.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THATZ-MAPP STUFF? I'M A CELEBRITY,
I CAN GET WHAT OTHER PEOPLECAN'T.
>> WE HAVE A HAND FULL OF PEOPLEWHO HAVE GOTTEN Z-MAPP.
Z-MAP MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WORK.
THE STUDIES ARE NOT IN YET.
>> Stephen: CARDS ON THE TABLETIME, ALL RIGHT?
DOES SOMEONE ELSE COME DOWN WITHEBOLA BECAUSE THIS GUY HAD EBOLA
SOMEBODY IN TEXAS?
>> THERE MIGHT BE ONE SECONDARYCASE, THERE MIGHT BE TWO
SECONDARY CASE.

UNITED STATES.
