[LAUGHTER]
NATION, THE FALLOUT FROM THE
HOUSING CRISIS CONTINUES.
THIS WEEK IT WAS REVEALED THAT
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
IS INVESTIGATING WELLS FARGO
BANK FOR ALLEGEDLY STEERING
AFRICAN-AMERICAN BORROWERS WITH
GOOD CREDIT TO SUBPRIME
MORTGAGES.
WHICH EXPLAINS WELLS FARGO'S
SHORT-LIVED SPOKESMAN SIR
OWES-A-LOT.
(RAPPING) HE LIKES BIG DEBTS,
AND HE CAN APPLY!
YOU OTHER BROTHERS CAN'T DENY,
WHEN A BANKER WALKS IN WITH AN
ITTY-BITTY RATE AND A BIG LOAN
IN YOUR FACE, YOU GET SPRUNG!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT NOW, ONE MAN IS STANDING UP
TO WELLS FARGO.
AND WINNING THE FIGHT, HE IS
TONIGHT'S DIFFERENCE MAKER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

ROGERS FOUGHT BACK AND ACTUALLY

>> YOU ARE A HERO TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE AND THANK YOU FOR COMING

VAMPIRE.
DO YOU SEE THE LITTLE TEETH
RIGHT THERE?
THOSE ARE VAMPIRE TEETH.
HE HAS -- ASK HIM!
ASK HIM.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
COME HERE.
COME ON!
LET'S GO.
TAXI.
[LAUGHTER]
GO.
HORN.
THIS IS HOW WE -- THE PEOPLE
WITH SHOPS OPEN, NONE OF THAT IS
HAPPENING NOW.
>> MAKE SURE YOU STAY SAFE OUT
THERE.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THE
FLOODING COMING UP.
>> Stephen: EXCUSE ME.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
>> Stephen: I HAVE A QUESTION
TO ASK YOU.
>> I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A
BROADCAST.
>> Stephen: WHO ISN'T?
HOLD ON SANJAY.
DID YOU TALK TO A GUY WHO
FORECLOSED ON A BANK?
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: DID YOU NOT NOTICE
HE WAS A VAMPIRE?
>> I DID NOTICE HE HAD SHARP
THAO *ET.
>> Stephen: AT NO POINT DID
YOUR JOURNALISTIC INSTINCTS KICK
IN AND SAY THAT'S A MORE
INTERESTING STORY.
>> IT'S A LIFESTYLE.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD TO BE
ACCEPTING OF A VAMPIRE.
>> WHY ARE YOU SO JUDGMENTAL.
>> Stephen: YOU TURNED THAT
MAN INTO THE JACKIE ROBINSON OF
VAMPIRES THANK IS OFFENSIVE ON A
LOT OF LEVELS.
>> Stephen: IT IS AND I DO NOT
FORGIVE YOU.

>> Stephen:LY BUT BEFORE I GO,
I WANT TO SAY THIS, I TRULY
ENJOYED YOUR BOOK TRANSPARENT, A
CANDID MEMOIR THAT HAD THE "NEW

FOX NEWS MISSED THE STORY, TOO.
>> GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND THANKS
FOR TELLING YOUR STORY.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
>> Stephen: CABLE NEWS HAS
COMPLETELY LOST ITS WAY.
THEY BROUGHT INTO THE SEXY
VAMPIRE COVER MODEL IMAGE WHEN
VAMPIRES ARE UNDEAD MONSTERS
THAT JOURNALISTS HAVE A SWORN
DUTY TO PROTECT US FROM.
A JOB THEY USED TO KNOW HOW TO
DO.
>> THESE BOYS MISSED AN
OPPORTUNITY TO NAIL THAT
VAMPIRE.
>> Stephen: LEGENDARY
ANCHORMAN DAN RATHER, WHO IS OLD
SCHOOL SRK READY TO HANDLE THE
UNDEAD AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.
>> IF I WAS INTERVIEWING HENRY
KISSINGER ABOUT THE SECRET
BOMBINGS IN CAME CAMBODIA AND
DISCOVERED HE WAS A ZOMBIE, I
WOULD HAVE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE
ENJOYED EATING HUMAN BRAINS.
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT THAT'S
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I
WOULD HAVE TO DO.
IT WAS UP TO ME TO BLOW THE
COFFIN HR *EUD OFF SORTIE AND
SKPHROEZ VAMPIRES FOR WHAT THEY
TRULY ARE.
I TRACKED THE VAMPIRE HERE TO
HIS FOUR BED YOM TUDOR IN
SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA.
>> MY NAME IS PATRICK ROGERS, I
AM A VAMPIRE.
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE FACE
OF EVIL.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THESE ARE THE HANDS OF EVIL.
BRUSHING THE HAIR OF EVIL.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THESE ARE THE THUMBS OF EVIL
TEXTING ON THE BLACKBERRY OF
SATAN.
[LAUGHTER]
WHO KNOWS WHAT ANCIENT AND
UNSPEAKABLE RITUALS HE PERFORMS
ON THIS CURSED GROUND.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT DO YOU SLEEP IN A COFFIN?
>> I DON'T NOT SLEEP IN A
COFFIN.
>> Stephen: THEN YOU HAVE
BATS?
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY BATS.
>> Stephen: YOU AT LEAST WANT
TO FEAST ON OUR TERROR.
>> I ASSURE YOU, I HAVE NO
INTEREST IN YOUR TERROR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: DAN, HELP ME OUT
HERE.
WHAT IS WITH THE TEETH.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS WITH THE
TEETH PATRICK.
>> WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT
THEY ARE POINTY.
I HAVE A PAIR OF ELONGATED
CANINES ON BOTH SIDES BUT I
DON'T DRINK BLOOD.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: FINE, NO COFFIN,
NO BATS, NO BLOOD, IS THERE
ANYTHING INTERESTING ABOUT YOU
AT ALL?
>> I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUED THE
NATION'S FOURTH LARGE YET BANK.
>> Stephen: WAIT, WHAT?
>> IN WERE IRREGULARITIES WITH
MY MORTGAGE.
AFTER SENDING MANY LETTERS TO WE
WELLS FARGO AND GETTING NO
RESPONSE I SUED THEM AND I WON
THE LAWSUIT.
THEY DIDN'T PAY THE JUDGMENT
ENTERED AGAINST THEM SO I HAD A
SHERIFF'S LEVEE PLACED AGAINST
THEIR DOWNTOWN PHILADELPHIA
OFFICE AND WITHIN TWO DAYS I HAD
A CHECK IN MY HANDS FOR THE
JUDGMENT AMOUNT.
I'M SATISFIED WITH THE
RESOLUTION OF THE SITUATION.
>> Stephen: WOW, THAT IS A
GREAT STORY.
PATRICK ROGERS, EVEN THOUGH YOU
MAY BE A HORRIFYING UNDEAD
CREATURE WHO RULES THE NIGHT,
YOU TURNED THE TABLES ON SOME
REAL BLOOD SUCKERS AND FOR THAT,
YOU ARE A DIFFERENCE MAKER!
