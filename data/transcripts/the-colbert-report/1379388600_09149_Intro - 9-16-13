SOME SPOILED.
BUNDLED INTO A LARGER CAKEDERIVATIVE, ALL RIGHT.

(LAUGHTER)BUT IT'S MOSTLY CAKE.
NOW FOLKS, IT FEELS LIKEONLY YESTERDAY THAT BANKS
WERE TAKING UNETHICAL RISKSWITH EVERYONE'S MONEY
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO DOINGIT YESTERDAY.
(LAUGHTER)BUT AMERICA IS DEFINED BY
ITS RESILIENT-- RESILIENCE.
NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKES WEMAKE, WE PICK OURSELVES UP,
WE DUST OURSELVES OFF ANDCOME TOGETHER WITH THE
COURAGE TO DENY THAT WE EVERMADE A MISTAKE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THESE PEOPLE GET IT IT'S
LIKE THAT OLD SAYING ABOUTWHATEVER IT IS YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HISTORY,I FORGET.
THE POINT IS AMERICA'SECONOMY IS BACK.
THE DOW IS REACHING RECORDHIGHS.
THE HOUSING MARKET ISREBOUNDING.
THE AUTO INDUSTRY EXISTS.
AND EVEN YOUNG PEOPLE AREFINDING GOOD JOBS IN
CONSTRUCTION.
AND FOLKS, THIS IS GOOD FOREVERYONE.
AS THEY SAY, A RISING TIDELIFTS ALL BOATS.
ALSO, BUY A BOAT OR YOU'LLDROWN.
BECAUSE 9-- 95% OF INCOMEGAINS SINCE THE RECOVERY
HAVE GONE TO THE TOP 1%.
BUT-- I KNOW, I WANT TOCHEER TOO.

IT WANTS YOU TO KNOW THATIT'S HAPPY NOW AND IT WANTS
YOU TO BE HAPPY TOO, BUT YOUHAVE TO MOVE ON.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT COMINGBACK.
IN FACT, IT'S GONE TO A FARMUPSTATE.
IN THAT I USED IT TO BUY ALARGE FARM UPSTATE.
BUT FOLKS, JUST BECAUSE THEYDON'T HAVE ANY MONIES,
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T BELIEVEIN THE AMERICAN MIDDLE
CLASS.
THEY ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLEGOD EVER PUT ON THIS EARTH
WHO GIVEN HALF A CHANCETHERE SUCK THE GOVERNMENT'S
TEET UNTIL IT IS AS SCHRIFFELED AS A BALLOON IN
FEBRUARY.
LOOK AT LAST MPT'S JOBREPORT, THE SHARE OF
AMERICANS WHO ARE EITHERLOOK WORKING OR LOOKING FOR
WORK IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVELSINCE 1978.
BACK THEN THE ONLY GROWTHINDUSTRIES FROM $6 MILLION
MANTECH SUPPORT, DISCO FEVERVACCINE RESEARCHER, AND
FARRAH FAWCETT POSTERSQUEEGEE MEN.
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSONWHOSE JOB IT IS TO CRITICIZE
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF A JOB.
>> AKA THE TAKERS AREEXPLODING WHILE THE LABOR
FORCE, AKA THE MAKERS AREIMPLODING.
>> IN A NATION OF HANDOUTS,WHO REALLY NEEDS A JOB.
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SIGNINGUP FOR FOOD STAMPS INCREASED
BY AN AVERAGE OF 11,000 PERDAY THROUGHOUT THE OBAMA
YEARS.
>> MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTINGFOOD STAMPS, CELL PHONES,
HOUSING ASSISTANCE, RENTALASSISTANCE, HEATING
ASSISTANCE, YOU NAME IT.
>> I NAME IT?
OH, OH, I LOVE MAKE YOUR OWNNEWS, ALL RIGHT.
FREE MARSHMALLOW PEEPS,SILLY STRAWS, ROLLS OF TIN
FOIL, HOT TUB FULL OFCARAMEL, MAGICAL
TALKING-- THERE IS NO LIMITTO THE AMOUNT OF STUFF I CAN
IMAGINE THEY GET FOR FREE.
THE POINT IS-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE POINT IS,THE POINT IS I des PIECE
THESE MOOCHERS BECAUSE THEYDONE EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY
TO des PIECE THEMSELVES.
AND THAT FACT BRINGS US TOTONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, UNDER BARACK OBAMA
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKEFOOD STAMPS HAVE EXPLODED.
BUT I REMEMBER A TIME WHENNEEDY AMERICANS DIDN'T
FLAUNT THEIR LACK OF WEALTH.
>> LISTEN, I KNOW THERE IS ABIG THING TRYING TO
DESTIGMATIZE FOOD STAMPS BUTTHE GOOD PART ABOUT THE
STIGMA IS IT ACTUALLY DOESSERVE AS AN IMPETUS TO GET
PEOPLE OFF OF IT.
>> THIS EXPLOSION OFENTITLEMENTS, AND THE SENSE
OF SHAME IS GONE.
>> THERE IS NO SHAME ANYMORE.
>> SHOULDN'T THERE BE ATLEAST SOME STIGMA?
>> IT USED TO BE THATSOMEBODY WAS ON FOOD STAMPS,
IT WAS LAKE HEY, THEY'RE ONFOOD STAMPS, YOU KNOW, LOSER.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S LIKE CHRIST SAID,
BLESSED ARE THE MEEK BUTWHAT A BUNCH OF, YOU KNOW,
LOSERS.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE TOO
LAZY TO WORK WHO ARE GAMINGTHE SYSTEM.
IT'S ALSO PEOPLE TOO INJUREDTO WORK.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLECLAIMING DISABILITY NOW.
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT CAN BECONSIDERED DISABILITY THESE
DAYS AND GET SSI AT THE AGEOF 40 OR 50, YOUR BACK HURTS
OR YOU HAVE A MOOD DISORDER.
NOW THESE THINGS DID NOTEXIST WHEN WE WERE COMING
UP.
>> A MOOD DISORDER?
>> Stephen: A MOOD DISORDER?
I MEAN WHO HAS A MOODDISORDER?
[BLEEP] DO IT RIGHT!
NOW WAIT A SECOND-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
TECHNICALLY THAT'S NOT AMOOD DISORDER, THAT'S A MOOD
SUPERPOWER.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FOLKS-- YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT, ALL OF THAT, THAT'SJUST TALK.
ONE CRUSADER IN PORTLAND,OREGON, IS TAKING ACTION.
WORKING ALONE, LIKE ALLGREAT AMERICAN HEROES.
YOU'RE BATMAN, YOU'REIRONMAN.
AND FOLKS-- (LAUGHTER)
>> THIS, THIS NEW SUPERHERODOES NOT FLY, HE FLIERS.
>> PORTLAND POLICE ARE NOWLOOKING INTO THE FLIERS
FOUND AROUND PORTLANDNEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE
THREATENING PEOPLE WITHDISABILITIES.
AT LEAST 75 PEOPLE HAVEGOTTEN THOSE FLYERS AND 14
NEIGHBORHOODS.
NOW THE FLYER CLAIMS THOSEWITH DISABILITIES THREATEN
DEMOCRACY BY ACCEPTINGGOVERNMENT BENEFITS WHILE
VOTING.
>> Stephen: YEAH, YOU SEE,IF YOU GET DISABILITY AND
YOU VOTE, YOU MIGHT VOTE TOKEEP YOUR DISABILITY.
IT'S SIMPLE.
IT'S THE SAME WAY-- IT'S THESAME WAY THAT IF YOU ARE'S
ON FIRE AND YOU VOTE, YOUMIGHT VOTE TO KEEP THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FOLKS, THE FLYERS DON'T
JUST IDENTIFY THE DISABILITYPROBLEM.
THEY PROMISE TO IDENTIFY THEDISABILITY PEOPLE, JIM?
>> THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THATRECEIVING BENEFITS MAKES
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ATHREAT TO THE REPUBLIC, AND
THEN WITH WHAT THE CITY SAYSIS AN UNDERLYING TONE OF
VIOLENCE, THE AUTHOR STATESTHAT THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE DISABLED IN THENEIGHBORHOOD ARE NOW BEING
POSTED WHERE THEY CAN BESEEN BY TAXPAYERS.
>> Stephen: AND TO SET ANEXAMPLE OF TRANSPARENCY AND
ACCOUNTABILITY, THIS HEROSIGNED USING HIS REAL NAME,
ARTEMUS OF THE WILDLANDS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
I ASSUME THAT IS HIS REALNAME.
NOW FOLKS, I WILL TELL YOUWHAT, I THINK ARTIE IS
RIGHT.
WE NEED TO KNOW NAMESBECAUSE SOMETIMES I CAN'T
TELL WHO'S DISABLED BYLOOKING AT THEM.
AND THAT'S WHY THIS HERO ISGOING TO NAME NAMES SO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD CAN DECIDE WHOIS TRULY DISABLED.
I MEAN YEAH, WHAT DO THEDOCTOR WAS DIAGNOSE THEM
KNOW.
I WANT A SECOND OPINION FROMTHE OLD GUY WHO WAVES AT
TRAFFIC.
IT'S LIKE, THINK OF IT LIKETHIS, IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL
JOINING NEIGHBORHOOD WATCHCALLING THE POLICE TO REPORT
A SUSPICIOUS CAR.
BUT FOR THE RECORD, I DON'TWANT TO BE COLD HEARTED
ABOUT THIS.
THESE DISABLED DESERVE MORETHAN A SNAP JUDGEMENT WHICH
IS WHY COMMUNITIES SHOULDAPPLY A STANDARDIZED TEST BY
THROWING THE DISABLED IN THERIVER.
NOW-- IF, IT WORKS LIKETHIS.
IF THEY DROWNED, IF THEYDROWN WE KNOW THEY WERE
DISABLED.
AND DESERVED EVERY PENNY OFGOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE THAT
SADLY THEY NO LONGER NEED INTHEIR WATERY GRAVE.
NOW BUT IF, IF THEY DON'TDROWN, IF THEY DON'T DROWN
THEY WERE MAKING IT AND WESHOULD BURN THEM AT THE
STAKE.
NOW I KNOW-- I KNOW ITSOUNDS A LITTLE DRASTIC BUT
FOLKS, WHEN YOU'RE DEALINGWITH PEOPLE WHO FEEL NO
SHAME, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TOBE SHAMELESS.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
