(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS I'M CHOOSING TO
BELIEVE THAT INCOME INEQUALITYISN'T AS BIG A DEAL AND DOESN'T
NEED TO CHANGE.
HERE TO TELL ME IT IS A BIG DEALAND NEEDS TO CHANGE IS FORMER
LABOR SECRETARY FOR PRESIDENTCLINTON AND STAR OF THE NEW
DOCUMENTARY "INEQUALITY FOR ALL"ROBERT REICH.
MR. REICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU WERE ON THE SHOW ABOUT THREE
YEARS AGO SOUNDING THE ALARMWARNING IF WE DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING IT WOULD TANK ECONOMYOR CAUSE A REVOLUTION.
THREE YEARS LATER I'M RICHERTHAN EVER.
I ASSUME YOU'RE BACK HERE TOAPOLOGIZE.
>> NO, I DIDN'T TELL YOU EXACTLYWHEN IT WOULD TANK THE ECONOMY
AND CAUSE A REVOLUTION.
I SAID IF WE CONTINUE IN THESAME DIRECTION IT'S DANGEROUS
FOR THE ECONOMY AND DANGEROUSFOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND I STILL
THINK IT IS VERY DANGEROUS.
>> Stephen: HOW DID IT CAUSE ANECONOMIC COLLAPSE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ME HAVINGALL THE MONEY IS A BAD THING.
>> MOST AMERICANS, THE VASTMIDDLE-CLASS AND THE POOR DON'T
THE PURCHASING POWER TO THEECONOMY GOING WHICH IS WHY THIS
RECOVERY IS THE MOST ANEMICRECOVERY ON RECORD.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG UNTIL THISREACHES A CRISIS POINT?
IF WE HOLD OFF LONG ENOUGH I MAYHAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO START MY
OWN ECONOMY AND BLOW THIS ONEOFF.
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE ARE SOWEALTHY THAT THEY ARE LEAVING
THE UNITED STATES AND THEY ARESETTING UP TAX HAVENS ABROAD AND
THEY ARE IN EFFECT SETTING UPTHEIR OWN ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: AND WHERE ARE THEYGOING?
CAN YOU GIVE ME A LIST OF ANYPLACES?
JUST GENERAL IDEAS?
>> WHY DON'T YOU TRY THENETHERLANDS.
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE.
BUT MOST AMERICANS AND MOSTPEOPLE AND MOST COUNTRIES ARE
STAYING PUT AND THEY RELY ON ANECONOMY THAT'S GROWING FOR
EVERYBODY.
WE DID HIT IN THE THREE DECADESAFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR,
THERE'S NO REASON WE CANNOT DOIT AGAIN.
>> Stephen: WHOSE FAULT IS THIS?
IS THIS OBAMA'S FAULT?
>> IT IS NOT OBAMA'S FAULT.
>> Stephen: OBAMACARE.
I MEANT OBAMACARE.
IS IT OBAMACARE'S FAULT?
>> NO, THIS IS NOT THE PART OFOBAMACARE.
THE PROBLEM HERE HAS BEENGROWING FOR THREE DECADES.
WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT BECAUSEWE BASICALLY TURNED OUR BACKS ON
THE PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: AS A RICH PERSON,I'M GETTING A LITTLE SCARED THAT
THE POORS MAY COME AND TAKE WHATI HAVE THERE'S ONLY 1% OF US.
WE'RE AN OPPRESSED MINORITY.
>> STEPHEN, DO NOT BE SCARED.
IF, IN FACT, WE HAVE A MOREEQUITABLE SOCIETY WHERE MORE
PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE IT,WHERE THERE'S A WIDER CIRCLE OF
PROSPERITY YOU ARE GOING TO DOBETTER, I GUARANTEE IT.
>> Stephen: THAT A MONEY-BACKGUERIN SEE IN
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANYMONEY BACK, NO.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF THE POOR ORMIDDLE-CLASS HAD SOMETHING THAT
WE RICH PEOPLE WANTED TO BUY?
YOU KNOW?
SURELY THEY HAVE PLENTIFULORGANS AND DAUGHTERS.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT WECOULD PURCHASE FROM THEM SO THEY
CAN GET MONEY?
>> YES, WELL, YOU COULD PURCHASE-- WE COULD HAVE A HIGHER
MINIMUM WAGE, FOR EXAMPLE, ANDMORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MORE
MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS TO TURNAROUND AND BUY STUFF WHICH WOULD
ACTUALLY MAKE YOU AND OTHERSLIKE YOU EVEN BETTER.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE ANSWER INTEN WORDS OR LESS-- AND DO NOT
MAKE ANY OF THEM THE WORD"TAXES.
(LAUGHTER)>> INVEST MORE AND BETTER IN OUR
SCHOOLS AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS.
AND TRY TO GET MORE REVENUESFROM THE RICH.

AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND GET BIGMONEY OUT OF POLITICS.
