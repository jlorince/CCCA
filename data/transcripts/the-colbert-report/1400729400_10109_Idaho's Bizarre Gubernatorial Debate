BUT OF COURSE THE BIGGESTPRIMARY WAS IN THE GREAT
STATE OF IDAHO.
ALSO KNOWN AS THE PILLOWMONTANA USES TO PRACTICE
KISSING.
(LAUGHTER)SEE THAT UP THERE.
(APPLAUSE)THE GUBERNATORIAL REPUBLICAN
NOMINATION WAS SEEN AS ACONTEST BETWEEN INCUMBENT
GOVERNOR AND WIND IN THEWILLOWS CHARACTER BUTCH
OTTER AND HIS CONSERVATIVEOPPONENT RUSS FULCHER WHO
IS RUNNING TO THE RIGHT SOMAYBE BADGER.
SO LAST THURSDAY'S PRIMARYDEBATE WAS DOMINATED BY TWO
OTHER CANDIDATES, HARLEYBROWN, FORMER COMMANDING
OFFICER OF NAVALCONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND
MR. WALT BAYES, A GREATGRANDFATHER AND HIGH SCHOOL
GRADUATE.
NOW THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL ABIG TENT.
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE WALTBAYES LIVES IN A TENT MADE
FROM THE SKIN OF A BEAR HEFOUGHT FOR A GOLD NUGGET.
AND FOLKS, EVEN AN OTTERHEAD LIKE ME WAS CHARMED
WHEN I HEARD HARLEY BROWN'SOPENING REMARKS EXPLAINING
WHY HE IS RUNNING.
>> I WAS AT THE LOW POINT OFMY LIFE.
I MEAN THINGS WERE BAD. AND ICRIED OUT TO GOD. I SAID,
GOD HOW ABOUT PUTTING MEBACK ON ACTIVE DUTY AND
MAKING ME A BATTALIONCOMMANDER. LONG STORY SHORT,
HE SAYS NO, SON, I GOT AHIGHER RANK FOR YOU, I WILL MAKE
YOU THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
AND I STAGGERED NOT ON HISPROMISE. I'LL GET INTO
THAT MORE WITH YOU.
DON'T THINK I'M CRAZY 'CAUSEI'M NOT.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO
REASSURING OPENINGSTATEMENTS, THAT IS RIGHT UP
THERE WITH I KNOW WE JUSTMET BUT I DON'T HAVE A HUMAN
HEAD IN MY FREEZER.
ALL RIGHT.
RIGHT OFF THE BAT I WASSOLD.
HARLEY BROWN WAS MY GUY BUT THEN WE HEARD FROM WALT
BAYES COMING AT YOU HOT ANDHARD LIKE A VENGEFUL BACKWOODS
SANTA.
>> JIM.
>> GOVERNOR OTTER, ABOUT THEEMISSIONS HE TRIED TO MAKE
ME TAKE AN EMISSIONS TESTAND I TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO
WITH IT.
I DROVE THREE YEARS AND MYWIFE DROVE THREE YEARS WITHOUT
ANY LICENSE OVER IT. NOBODY DONEANYTHING.
I STAND ON PRINCIPLES.
I WENT TO JAIL FOR HOMESCHOOLING.
I DID KILL A WOLF WHILE ITWAS STILL AN ENDANGERED
SPECIES.
>> Stephen: SMART MOVE,SMART MOVE, WALT, OPEN WITH
YOUR CRIMINAL HISTORY.
GET IT OUT THERE BEFORE THELANE STREAM MEDIA HITS YOU
WITH ALL THOSE GOTCHAQUESTIONS ABOUT SHOOTING
WOLVES.
OKAY THIS ROUND POINT BAYES,ESPECIALLY AFTER BROWN
ALMOST LOST ME WHEN HE CAMEOUT AS SOFT ON GAY MARRIAGE.
>> I USED TO DRIVE TAXIS INBOISE FOR 20 YEARS AT NIGHT.
AND I PICKED UP MY FAIRSHARE OF THE GAY COMMUNITY.
AND THEY HAVE TRUE LOVE FORONE ANOTHER.
I'M TELLING YOU, THEY LOVEEACH OTHER MORE THAN I LOVE
MY MOTORCYCLE.
(LAUGHTER)>> OKAY.
ADMITTEDLY THAT PULLS AT THEHEART STRINGS.
BUT AS A CONSERVATIVE I DIDNOT EXPECT TO HEAR PRO GAY
SENTIMENTS FROM A BURLYMAN IN A TINY LEATHER HAT AND
VEST.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THEN HARLEY WON ME BACK.
>> THE KEY IS GETTING OURLAND BACK FROM THE FEDS.
AND HERE'S MY PLAN OFATTACK.
YOU BIND THOSE EVIL SPIRITSTHAT ARE BEHIND THE FEDS
WITH THE BLOOD OF JESUS, THENAME OF JESUS, THE POWER OF
THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE POWEROF AGREEMENT, THE WORD OF
GOD.
TAKE AIR SUPERIORITY ANDTHEN ROLL IN WITH YOUR TANKS.
>> MR. BROWN.
>> BLITZKRIEG.
>> MR. BROWN, THE QUESTIONWAS ABOUT TAXES.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: MAYBE, MAYBE SO.
AND HE WAS GETTING THEREBEFORE YOU SO RUDELY
INTERRUPTED HIM.
CLEARLY HIS POINT WAS THATIF YOU USE IT TO BIND THE
EVIL SPIRITS BEHIND THE FEDSTHE BLOOD OF CHRIST SHOULD
BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
WELL, FOLKS, BEFORE LONG ANDTHEN AFTER LONG, IT WAS TIME
FOR CLOSING STATEMENTS.
WALT, STICK THE LANDING.
>> DO YOU REMEMBER CHERNOBYL?
WHERE THE RUSSIANS HAD ALITTLE PROBLEM WITH THEIR
ATOMIC ENERGY?
CHERNOBYL, WHEN YOUTRANSLATE THAT INTO ENGLISH
IT COMES OUT WORMWOOD,WORMWOOD IS MENTIONED IN THE
BIBLE A WHOLE LOT WHEN YOU'RESTUDYING THE LAST DAYS AND IT IS
RADIATION. THEY GAVE THOSEPEOPLE THAT WORK THERE
SOMETHING CALLED POTASSIUMIODIDE AND IT PLUGS
UP YOUR THYROID GLAND SO ITWON'T TAKE THIS RADIATION IN.
AND ANOTHER THING YOU WANTTO KNOW IS OUR ENERGY PLANTS
THAT IS RUN BY ATOMIC, THEYCAN STAND 1/15 OF AN
EARTHQUAKE LIKE THAT ONE INJAPAN AND MY BIBLE SAYS IT WILL
GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.
WE BETTER GET US SOME,FOLKS.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT IS ACAMPAIGN SLOGAN THAT
AMERICANS CAN RALLY BEHIND.
WALT BAYES, YOU REMEMBERCHERNOBYL WHEN YOU TRANSLATE
THAT IT COMES OUT WORMWOODWHICH IS MENTIONED IN THE
BIBLE A WHOLE LOT, POTASSIUMIODIDE WE GETTER GET US SOME
2014.
NOW FOLKS-- (APPLAUSE)
BUT FOLKS EVEN WALT'SMESSAGE OF HOPE PALED IN
COMPARISON TO THE POWER OFHARLEY BROWN'S CLOSER.
>> AFTER GOD TOLD ME WASGOING MAKE ME PRESIDENT I
WENT OUT AND GOT THEPRESIDENTIAL SEAL TATTOOED
RIGHT HERE ON MY SHOULDER.
I WAS LIVING IN FAT JACK'SCELLAR BECAUSE MY EX-WIFE
HAD GIVEN ME TRUMPED UPRESTRAINING ORDERS.
I COULDN'T SEE MY KIDS.
IT WAS A MESS. FAT JACK'S OLDLADY,
FAT JACK'S WIFE SAID GET THISLUNATIC OUT OF MY CELLAR.
YOU HAVE A CHOICE, FOLKS. ACOWBOY, A CURMUDGEON, A BIKER
OR A NORMAL GUY. TAKE YOUR PICK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE'RELEAVING IT UP TO YOU.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YEAH!
WHO INVITED THE NORMAL GUY.
YOU GOT A COWBOY, ACURMUDGEON AND AN OLD COOT.
THEY WERE ONE CONSTRUCTIONWORKER AWAY FROM BREAKING
INTO YMCA.
WELL, FOLKS, SHOCKINGLYNEITHER OF THESE TWO WON THE
PRIMARY LAST NIGHT.
AND NEITHER DID TEA PARTYCANDIDATE RUSS FULLCHER.
THE NOMINATION WENT TOGOVERNOR OTTER.
BUT TEA PARTY FOLKS, THEFIGHT IS NOT OVER.
WE STILL HAVE THE GENERALELECTION.
AND AFTER WATCHING THATDEBATE IT IS CLEAR TO ME
THAT THE CANDIDATE IDAHONEEDS IS FAT JACK'S OLD
LADY.
(LAUGHTER)SHE-- FAT JACK'S OLD LADY--
(APPLAUSE)HAS A MESSAGE THAT RESONATES
WITH AMERICA.
GET THIS LUNATIC OUT OF MYCELLAR.
-- CELLAR, THAT IS THEMESSAGE THAT CAN DEFEAT NOT
JUST GOVERNOR OTTER BUTALSO IDAHO'S DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE POTATO WITH AMUSTACHE.
