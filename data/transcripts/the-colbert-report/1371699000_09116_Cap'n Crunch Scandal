( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
"REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH
US.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
FOLKS, IF YOU ARE A LONG-TIME
WATCHER OF THIS PROGRAM -- I
MEAN, IF YOU REALLY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME, YOU KNOW --
PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THIS
SHOW WILL KNOW THERE IS NO
BIGGER SUPPORTER OF THE MILITARY
THAN YOURS TRULY.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FELLA AT
THE END OF THIS BUSINESS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY AT THE SLIGHTEST HINT
OF WORLD CONFLICT I AM ALWAYS
THE FIRST TO YELL "LET'S GO TO
WAR!"
AND "OW, MY BACK!"
(LAUGHTER)
BUT A HUGE MILITARY SCANDAL HAS
JUST BROKEN AND IT'S REALLY
SHAKEN MY TRUST IN OUR FIGHTING
FORCES.
>> CAP'N CRUNCH APPARENTLY ONLY
HAS THREE STRIPES AND A WRITER
FOR WWW.FOOD'S BE.COM SAYING IF
YOU LOOK AT THE NAVY'S CAPTAIN
RANK SHOULD HAVE FOUR STRIPES.
A COMMANDER HAS THREE SO HE'S
NOT A CAPTAIN AT ALL.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT!
IT TURNS OUT ALL THIS TIME THIS
CAP'N WAS ACTUALLY A COMMANDRA.
(LAUGHTER)
OH CAP'N MY CAP'N.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW COULD YOU?
THIS WHOLE TIME YOU'VE BEEN PART
OF A BALANCED BETRAYAL!
(LAUGHTER)
THE ONLY REASON I ATE A SERIAL
THAT LOOKED LIKE THE ROTTEN
TEETH OF A PIRATE ON SHORE LEAVE
WAS BECAUSE I WAS LED TO BELIEVE
THAT HE WAS AN ACTIVE DUTY U.S.
NAVAL CAPTAIN!
I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPORTING THE
TROOPS.
(LAUGHTER)
IF HORATIO MAGELLAN CRUNCH--
LOOK IT UP--
(LAUGHTER)
IS LYING ABOUT THIS, WHAT ELSE
IS HE LYING ABOUT, FOLKS?
ARE CRUNCHBERRIES NOT ACTUAL
FRUIT?
(LAUGHTER)
DID HE REALLY DEFEAT SOGGIES?
AND IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE
DISTURBING RUMORS THAT IN THE
1940s HE WAS KNOWN AS KIPTAN
VON KRUNCH?
THE MOST FEARED U-BOAT CAPTAIN
IN THE FUHRER'S KRIEGSMARINE?
I HOPE NOT!
I SURE HOPE NOT!
NOW, CRUNCH HAS TRIED TO PUT
THIS STORY TO REST BY ACTUALLY
TWEETING TODAY "REGARDING
TODAY'S RUMORS, OF COURSE I'M A
CAP'N.
IT'S THE CRUNCH, NOT THE
CLOTHES, THAT MAKE A MAN."
(LAUGHTER)
HASHTAG PAIDMYDUES.
HASHTAG BULL (BLEEP).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I BET YOU ANYTHING HE DIDN'T PAY
HIS DUES.
I BET HE SENT IN TEN BOX TOPS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I AM CALLING FOR A
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION!
HOW FAR DOES THIS SERIAL SCANDAL
SPREAD?
IS GENERAL MILLS JUST A COLONEL?
(LAUGHTER)
IS COUNT CHOCULA JUST
MR. CHOCULA?
(LAUGHTER)
AND WHAT ABOUT FROSTED FLAKES.
WE WILL FIND OUT THEY'RE
ADEQUATE?
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I JUST HOPE AND PRAY -- I JUST
HOPE THIS SCANDAL DOESN'T SPREAD
TO THE NUMBER-ONE CHILDREN'S
SERIAL MASCOT, KASHI GOOD
FRIENDS.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK WE DESERVE TO KNOW.
ARE THEY REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WHO
ENJOY HIGH FIBER?
OR ARE THEY JUST BUSINESS
ASSOCIATES WHO SYNCHRONIZE THEIR
BOWL MOVEMENTS FOR MARKETING
PURPOSES
