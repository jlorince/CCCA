(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO GET TO
THE NEWS.
IT'S TOO GOOD.
FOLKS.
FREQUENT SHOPPERS OF THIS
SHOW KNOW THAT I WAS AN
EARLY FAN OF RICK PERRY.
AND MY MAN'S HAD A ROUGH
START.
AND A PRETTY BAD RESTART.
BUT NOW HE'S READY TO
RE-RESTART WITH THIS GREAT
NEW AD.
>> HIS DAD WAS A TENANT
FARMER.
HIS WIFE, A NURSE.
RICK PERRY SERVED IN THE AIR
FORCE, THEN CAME HOME TO
FARM COTTON.
A SOLID CONSERVATIVE,
PERRY'S BALANCED EVERY
BUDGET, PASSED MAJOR LAWSUIT
REFORM, CUT 15 BILLION IN
SPENDING.
THE RESULT: ONE MILLION NEW
JOBS.
RICK PERRY CONSERVATIVE
LEADERSHIP THAT WORK ITS.
>> MAKE US GREAT AGAIN IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT
OF THIS AD.
>> Stephen: WOW!
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN WHO'S TO THE GOING TO
LIKE RICK PERRY AFTER THAT.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT OLD
LADY THERE IS BARBARA BUSH.
(LAUGHTER)
WHISPERING I WISH YOU WERE
MY SON.
GREAT, GREAT CAMPAIGN AD BUT
THAT AD WAS NOT MADE BY THE
PERRY CAMPAIGN.
IT WAS CREATED BY THE MAKE
US GREAT AGAIN SUPERPAC, AN
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.
YOU SEE, A SUPERPAC MAY NOT
COORDINATE ITS ACTIVITIES
WITH CANDIDATES.
SO IT'S MERELY A COINCIDENCE
THAT MAKE US GREAT AGAIN
SUPERPAC HEAD MIKE TOOMEY
CO-OWNS A PRIVATE ISLAND
WITH DAVID CARNEY, PERRY'S
TOP POLITICAL ADVISOR.
I'M SURE THEY'RE NOT
COORDINATING ON THAT LITTLE
PRIVATE ISLAND DOWN THERE.
THEY'RE PROBABLY DOING
SOMETHING INNOCENT LIKE
HUNTING MAN.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS
I'M THE HEAD OF COLBERT
SUPERPAC.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO TO A VOTE THE APPEARANCE
OF COORDINATING WITH
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL BACK
RUNNER BUDDY ROEMER, WHEN HE
WAS ON MY SHOW, I WAS FORCED
TO WEAR AN ISOLATION BUCKET
ON MY HEAD.
NOW LUCKILY ONE GROUP OUT
THERE FOUND A WAY TO WORK
WITH A CANDIDATE WITHOUT
COORDINATING WITH THEM.
THEN THE NEBRASKA DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
THEY'VE SPENT OVER $600,000
ON AN AD CAMPAIGN STARRING
SENATOR BEN NELSON.
I ASSUME MOST OF THAT PAID
FOR THE TRAINED MARMOT
PLAYING HIS HAIR.
NOW NORMALLY, FOLKS, TO
SUPPORT A CANDIDATE STATE
PARTIESTD
$240,000.
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, AND I
DID NOT KNOW THIS, $600,000
IS MORE THAN $240,000.
(LAUGHTER)
SO I MAY HAVE OVERBID ON
THAT RARE PENNY WHERE
LINCOLN'S HEAD WAS
UPSIDE DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS, TURNS OUT THE
LIMITS DON'T APPLY HERE
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WERE
FUNCTIONING AS AN
INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION
ENGAGED IN ISSUE ADVOCACY.
IN THIS CASE, THE DEMOCRATS
ARE NOT REALLY A POLITICAL
PARTY, SOMETHING I THINK WE
ALL SUSPECTED.
BUT REMEMBER, INDEPENDENT
GROUPS LIKE SUPERPACS CANNOT
COORDINATE WITH CANDIDATES.
SO THE DEMOCRATS CLAIM THAT
THE NELSON ADS ARE NOT
CAMPAIGN ADS BUT INSTEAD
ISSUE ADS.
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF.
>> THIS IS TOTALLY
POLITICAL.
>> THEY DON'T GET IT THEY
PUT POLITICS AHEAD OF WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE COUNTRY.
>> WE NEED TO BALANCE THE
BUDGET.
BUT NOT ON THE BACKS OF
SENIOR CITIZENS.
I'M BEN NELSON.
I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE
BECAUSE WE NEED TO STOP
PLAYING POLITICS AND FIND
COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS.
>> Stephen: CLEARLY AN ISSUE
AD.
THE ISSUE, BEN NELSON IS
PRETTY GREAT.
SO I SAY BRAVO DEMOCRATS.
YOU ARE BLAZING A CAMPAIGN
TRAIL TO BE FOLLOWED BY
SUPERPAC PIONEERS IN THEIR
CON STOGAñr MONEY WAGONS.
OF COURT EVERY LEWIS AND
CLARK NEARS THEIR BEAUTIFUL
SACAGAWEA.
IN THIS CASE IT'S KARL ROVE.
WHO IS CLEARLY A SACK OF
SOMETHING.
YOU SEE--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)çó
>> TODAY, FOLKS, TODAY ROVE
SUPERPAC AMERICAN CROSSROADS
FILED THIS ACTUAL REQUEST
WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION ASKING FOR
APPROVAL TO MAKE ISSUE ADS
WITH FEDERAL CANDIDATES JUST
LIKE THE DEMOCRATS
EXPLAINING WHILE THESE
ADVERTISEMENTS WOULD BE
FULLY COORDINATED, THEY
WOULD PRESUMABLY NOT QUALIFY
AS COORDINATED
COMMUNICATIONS.
COORDINATED AND NOT
COORDINATED.
HE'S LIKE A ZEN CAMPAIGN
MASTER ASKING WHAT IS THE
SOUND OF ONE HAND
