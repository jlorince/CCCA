>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS APRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST, WHO
BELIEVES THAT OBAMACARE ISWORKING.
WOW.
I HOPE HE'S GOT MENTAL HEALTHCOVERAGE.
( LAUGHTER )PLEASE WELCOME PAUL KRUGMAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
THIS IS ACTUALLY YOUR SIXTH TRIPTO THE SHOW.
>> INDEED, IT IS.
>> Stephen:  DID YOU BRINGYOUR FREQUENT GUEST CARD.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE THAT?
>> FREE LATTE.
THERE YOU GO.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU GET A--YOU GET A FREE SUB.
>> THERE WE GO!
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
NOW, PAUL, YOU KNOW WHY I HAVEYOU HERE TONIGHT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  OKAY?
BECAUSE I GET TO GLOAT OVER THEFACT THAT OBAMACARE IS A PROVEN
JOB KILLER.
THE C.B.O. CAME OUT WITH AREPORT THAT SAYS 2.5 MILLION
PEOPLE FEWER WILL HAVE JOBS BY2021 BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TOAMERICA HELPING TO PROMOTE THIS
JOB KILLER.
>> THIS IS QUITE AN AMAZINGPIECE OF-- I SEE A LOT OF MEDIA
MALPRACTICE.
A LOT OF THEM GOT IT WRONG.
THE C.B.O. DID NOT SAY THAT.
>> Stephen:  YES, THEY DID?
HAVE YOU READ THE REPORT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  I HAVE NOT.
THAT WAY I GET TO CLAIM ANYTHINGI WANT PAUL KRUGMAN.
>> WHAT THE C.B.O. SAID, WE KNOWA NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE,
ONCE THEY HAVE THE GUARANTEE OFHEALTH INSURANCE, THERE ARE A
LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO AREWORKING EXTRA HOURS, STAYING IN
FULL-TIME JOBS, BECAUSE THEYNEED THE HEALTH INSURANCE.
THERE'S PARENTS OF YOUNGCHILDREN, THERE'S OLDER PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, WHO ARE 63, AND NOT INGOOD HEALTH BUT THEY'RE HANGING
ON WITH THOSE FULL-TIME JOBSUNTIL THEY CAN GET MEDICARE.
WITH THE LAW IN EFFECT, A FAIRNUMBER-- SOME PEOPLE-- WILL WORK
SHORTER HOURS.
SOME PEOPLE WILL RETIRE EARLIER.
SO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURSWILL BE REDUCED, VOLUNTARILY.
PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO WORK LESS.
NO JOBS LOST.
AND ACTUALLY THE C.B.O. SAYS INBIG-- THEY SAY RIGHT THERE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE VOLUNTARYCHOICE.
PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO WORK LESS.
THEY MADE THE MISTAKE OF SAYINGTHIS WILL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF
TWO MILLION FULL-TIME JOBS BEINGREMOVED.
( LAUGHTER )BUT THE NEXT DAY, THE DIRECTOR
OF THE C.B.O. WENT ON TO SAY WEARE NOT TALKING ABOUT JOB
LOSSES.
AND IN FACT, I AM-- THIS IS AGOOD THING.
>> Stephen:  HE HAD TO SAYTHAT, HIS JOB WAS ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  YOU THINK THEOBAMA PEOPLE DIDN'T GET TO HIM.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOUSAY IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE
MORE MOBILE AND BE ABLE TO LEAVETHEIR JOBS AND NOT BE TIED DOWN
TO HEALTH INSURANCE SO THEY CANWORK LESS IF THEY WANT TO.
THAT'S OBAMA'S VISION FORAMERICA.
EVERYBODY WORK LESS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  HEY!
PHONE IT IN!
EVERYBODY GETS A SNOW DAY.
( CHEERS )( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S HOW ROME FELL.
>> WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOREVERYBODY BY TAXING MOM.
>> Stephen:  YOU WILL?
HOW IS OBAMACARE NOTREDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, OKAY?
WHY SHOULD MY HARD-EARNED MONEYGO PAY FOR SUZY SLUT'S
CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS?
I DON'T NEED THEM.
BUT "SANDY SPREAD YOUR LEGS"WANTS HER CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS OR
LUCY LUNG MACHINE.
I'M HEALTHY OR I'M A YOUNGPERSON-- WHICH I AM-- WHY SHOULD
I BE PAYING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'SHEALTH CARE.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY INSURANCEWORKS.
>> THAT'S THE WAY INSURANCEWORKS.
IF YOU BUY FIRE INSURANCE, MOSTPEOPLE DON'T HAVE FIRES, AND
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE FIRES ARESUBSIDIZING PEOPLE WHO HAVE
FIRES.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T HAVEFIRE INSURANCE.
IF MY HOUSE CATCHES FIRE I'LLGET INSURANCE.
>> I THINK THE SLOGAN FOROBAMACARE SHOULD BE STUFF
HAPPENS AND IT COULD HAPPEN TOYOU.
EVERY ONE OF US IS AT RISK OFBECOMING SICK, HAVING SOMETHING
WHERE WE REALLY NEED TOINSURANCE TO PAY FOR IT.
INSURANCE MARKETS DON'T WORKWELL.
IF WE WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEMWHERE AMERICANS HAVE A BASIC
GUARANTEE THEY CAN HAVE THEHEALTH CARE THEY NEED, IS THAT
THEY CAN AFFORD IT WHEN THEYNEED IT, THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE OBAMACARE ANDEVERY OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD HAS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU NEED
IT THAT YOU CAN AFFORD.
THAT'S WHAT OBAMACARE GIVES YOU.
>> Stephen:  WHEN YOU NEED ITTHAT YOU CAN AFFORD BECAUSE
YOU'RE TAKING MY MONEY.
>> WE'RE POOLING.
>> Stephen:  THAT'SREDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
POOLING MONEY IS REDISTRIBUTIONOF WEALTH.
YOU'LL ADMIT IT.
SAY IT.
SAY IT.
IT'S REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
>> ACTUALLY, I'M OKAY WITH ALITTLE --
>> Stephen:  YOU ALMOST SAIDIT.
YOU ALMOST GAVE AWAY THE WHOLEGAME.
YOU ALMOST GAVE AWAY-->> LIFE INSURANCE IS
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH FOR.
>> ISN'T ONE OF THE PROBLEMSHERE IS SO FAR ONLY OLD PEOPLE
ARE SIGNING UP FOR THIS, ANDIT'S GOT TO BE YOUNG PEOPLE
SIGNING UP FOR IT?
>> ACTUALLY, WHAT YOU WANT TOLOOK AT IS YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SAYING.
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S AN OLDER MIXOF PEOPLE, BUT IT'S WITHIN
EXPECTATIONS.
IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BETTERTHAN THEY EXPECTED.
YOU WANT TO KEEP READING THEFINE PRINT HERE.
>> NOT IF IT'S GOING TO MAKE MELOSE THE ARGUMENT.
>> THERE WE GO.
>> Stephen:  WHAT CAN OBAMA DOTO GET MORE YOUNG PEOPLE
INTERESTED IN OBAMACARE OTHERTHAN SENDING OUT TEEN ICON PAUL
KRUGMAN TO TALK TO THEM?
>> I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.
THE PENALTY FOR NOT SIGNING UPIS NOT MUCH THIS YEAR.
IT GETS BIGGER NEXT YEAR.
>> Stephen:  IT'S 90 BUCKS ORSOMETHING.
>> ALSO YOU'RE GOING TO START TOHEAR-- YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
START TO HEAR FROM FRIENDS THAT,"MY GOD, I HAD THIS ACCIDENT,
AND I ENDED UP IN THE EMERGENCYROOM, AND THAT WOULD HAVE COST
ME $20,000, BUT THANK GOD I HAVEINSURANCE."
>> Stephen:  AGAIN,REDISTRIBUTING MY WEALTH.
>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OFREDISTRIBUTING FROM PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN LUCKY TO PEOPLE WHOARE UNLUCKY.
>> Stephen:  LUCKY!
LUCKY?
YOU THINK I DIDN'T EARN THISJOB?
I MEAN, I DID THE WORK OF BEINGTOLLBOOTH OPERATOR ON THE JERSEY
TURNPIKE AND HAVING JON STEWARTDRIVE THROUGH ONE DAY AND SAY,
"DO YOU WANT A TELEVISION SHOW?"I PUT THE WORK IN.
>> THERE WE GO.
>> Stephen:  PAUL, THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
PAUL KRUGMAN, "NEW YORK TIMES."
2.5 MILLION PEOPLE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
