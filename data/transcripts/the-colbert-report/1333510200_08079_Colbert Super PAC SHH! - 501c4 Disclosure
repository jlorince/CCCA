SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED AND, DUE TO A MANUFACTURING ERROR, HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.
(LAUGHTER) OKAY, FOLKS, BUT ENOUGH ABOUT MY SECRET OF SUPER PACS.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY EVEN MORE SECRETIVE SUPER PAC,
COLBERT SUPER PAC S.H.S.
SO NAMED BECAUSE IT CAN RAISE (BLEEP) LOADS OF MONEY.
(LAUGHTER) AND IT NEVER HAS TO DISCLOSE ITS DONORS BECAUSE IT IS A QUASI-CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION
CALLED A 501C 4.
CRITICS SAY GROUPS LIKE MINE ARE UNREGISTERED MONEY GUNS SHOOTING UP THE ELECTION WITH UNTRACEABLE
POLITICAL SLUSH FUND WHO-TO-WHICH I SAY UH-HUH.
(LAUGHTER) BUT SOME STATE GOVERNMENTS OUT THERE WANT TO EXPOSE THE NAMES OF OUR DONORS!
BUT MY HERO KARL ROVE WHO HAS HIS OWN 501C4 CROSS ROADS G.P.S.
IS NOT TAKING THIS LYING DOWN.
HE IS TAKING IT SITTING UP AT FOX NEWS.
>> NOW THIS TALK OF STATE REASURERS WHO MANAGE PENSIONT FUNDS AND INVEST MONEY WITH BIG
HEDGE FUNDS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FORCE THOSE FUNDS TO DISCLOSE THEIR MONEY SO WE KNOW IF
THEY'RE IF YOU BELIEVING MONEY IS-TO-SPECIFIC SUPER PACS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT LINE OF ATTACK?
>> WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.
IN THE 1940s AND '50s A NUMBER OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ATTEMPTED TO FORCE A
501C 4 TO DISCLOSE ITS DONORS.
THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE TO NOT GIVE TO THAT ORGANIZATION.
THE GROUP WAS THE N.A.A.C.P.
WHICH IS A 501C-4.
>> Stephen: YES, CROSS ROADS G.P.S. IS JUST LIKE THE N.A.A.C.P., THE NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF CORPORATE PERSON HOOD.
(LAUGHTER) AND CARL IS THEIR MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
HE HAS BEEN TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP!
TECHNICALLY IT WAS ASPEN AND HE TOOK THE CHAIR LIFT, BUT THAT STILL COUNTS.
(LAUGHTER) AND CIVIL RIGHTS, FOLKS... YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO ONE'S GOING TO KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN.
CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS ARE BEING ATTACKD FROM ALL SIDES.
JUST THIS PAST FRIDAY A DISTRICT COURT JUDGED RULED 501C-4s MUST DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS.
WHY?
SPERM BANKS DON'T!
(LAUGHTER) SOME DO.
OH, I HAVE A TON OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE.
(LAUGHTER) AND ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THE I.R.S. IS NOW
PRESSURING 501C-4s LIKE MINE TO JUST PHI THEIR TAX-PROTECTED STATUS AS SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS.
OF COURSE I'M A SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANIZATION!
I BELIEVE WELFARE IS SOCIALISM!
(LAUGHTER) WELL, I REFUSE TO REVEAL MY DONORS AND I WILL NOT BE THE ONE GOING TO JAIL.
IT'S GOING TO BE YOU, HAM ROVE!
YOU'RE THE BRAINS OF THIS OUTFIT!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) LISTEN UP, MISTER, YOU'RE THE BRAINS OF THIS OUTFIT AND YOU'RE
THE GROUND UP LIPS AND OTHER TKPWAPB MEAT.
YOU'RE GOING TO THE BIG HOUSE AND I TELL YOU, THEY EAR GOING TO EAT YOU ALIVE.
PROBABLY WITH SOME BROWN MUSTARD.
YOU MIGHT TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE,
I CAN'T TRUST YOU.
WHAT HAVE I
