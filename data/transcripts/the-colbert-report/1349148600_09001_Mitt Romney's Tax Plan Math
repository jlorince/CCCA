COMEDY CENTRAL
>> Stephen: HEY, LOOK AT YOU.
COME ON.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
WOW.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, YOU SPOIL ME.
YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM A HUGE FAN OF REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND JERSEY BOYS UNDERSTUDY PAUL RYAN.
WHICH IS WHY I AM ENRAGED.
BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND THIS GOOD MAN WAS ATTACKED BY THE LIBERAL HACKS OVER AT FOX NEWS.
(LAUGHTER) JUST LISTEN TO CHRIS WALLACE DRILLING RYAN OVER ROMNEY'S PROPOSED 20% ACROSS ACCOUNT BOARD TAX CUT.
>> THE OBAMA CAMP SAYS INDEPENDENT GROUPS SAY IF YOU CUT THOSE TAX RATES FOR EVERYBODY 20%, IT COSTS $5
TRILLION OVER TEN YEARS, TRUE?
>> NOT IN THE LEAST BIT TRUE.
>> Stephen: TRUE, NOT TRUE, WHO CARES?
(LAUGHTER) IT'S OVER TEN YEARS.
ROMNEY AND RYAN WILL ONLY BE IN OFFICE FOR EIGHT OF THOSE.
LET PRESIDENT BACHMANN WORRY ABOUT IT IN 2020.
THAT IS WHAT HINDSIGHT IS FOR.
BUT FOLKS, JUST LISTEN TO THIS PIT BULL.
>> HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST.
>> IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CUT, WE'LL GET TO THE DEDUCTIONS.
>> THE CUT IN TAX RATES IS LOWER ALL AMERICAN TAX RATE BY 20%.
>> HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST.
>> IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
>> Stephen: OKAY, REVENUE NEUTRAL, CHRIS.
BUT FOR SOME REASON WALLACE WOULDN'T TAKE NO ANSWER FOR AN ANSWER.
(LAUGHTER) JIM?
>> WELL, IT'S NOT REVENUE NEUTRAL UNLESS YOU TAKE AWAY THE DEDUCTION.
>> LET ME JUST --
>> YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME THE MATH.
>> WELL, I DON'T HAVE-- IT WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE MATH.
>> Stephen: GREAT ANSWER.
(LAUGHTER) WHY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GREAT ANSWER WHY IS IT A GREAT ANSWER?
WELL, IT WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN BUT TRUST ME T WAS A GREAT ANSWER.
(LAUGHTER) BESIDES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR MATH.
THAT'S WHY RYAN SEACREST'S TOP 40 COUNTDOWN DIDN'T CATCH ON UNTIL THEY ADDED SONGS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW OBVIOUSLY THE MATH BEHIND HOW ROMNEY CAN GIVE EVERYONE A 20% TAX CUT WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THE
GOVERNMENT IS JUST WAY TOO ADVANCED FOR US REGULAR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND.
IT'S UNFATHOMMABLY COMPLEX LIKE STRING THEORY.
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GRASP THAT THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLY 11 COEXISTED DIMENSIONS.
EIGHT OF WHICH ARE WHERE ROMNEY SHELTERS HIS WEALTH.
(LAUGHTER) JUST TRUST HIM, JUST TRUST HIM.
(APPLAUSE) THE MIDDLE CLASS IS BROKEN DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PAUL RYAN IS DRIVING UP IN A BLACK WINDOWLESS VAN
AND SAYING GET IN.
(LAUGHTER) DON'T ASK WHERE WE ARE WE GOING.
IT WOULD TAKE HIM TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN.
(LAUGHTER) JUST GET IN.
AND IT PUTS THE LOTION ON
