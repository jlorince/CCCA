>> FOLKS SPEAKING OF SPOOKY,EVERY DAY AMERICA WAKES UP TO A
NEW REVELATION ABOUT NSA SPYING,JUST HOW DEEP DOES IT GO AND WHY
DOES THAT CLOCK ON MY BED KNOWEXACTLY WHAT TIME I NEED TO WAKE
UP?
>> STILL, FOLKS, THE MORE ILEARN, THE SAFER I FEEL.
NSA IS PROTECTING AMERICA ANDTHEIR GLOBAL SPY NETWORK MAKES
US INVINCIBLE TO ANYONE WHO ISNOT A 29-YEAR-OLD DUDE WITH A
THUMB DRIVE.
>> BUT WITH SOME LEAKS IN MY OWNHOUSE AND I HOPE THE GOVERNMENT
HANDLES THE LEAKS THE SAME WAYBY HIRING A CONTRACTOR TO WHACK
IT A FEW TIMES WITH A MONKEYWRENCH.
BECAUSE TODAY BROUGHT ANOTHERTHE EXPLOSIVE REVELATION.
>> THERE IS ANOTHER NEW REPORTON THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
TODAY.
AND ITALIAN MAGAZINE CALLEDPANORAMA REPORTS THE NSA MAY
HAVE SPIED ON THE POPE.
AND SOME CARDINALS.
SOURCES AT THE MAGAZINE HAVEBEEN TOLD THE NSA EAVESDROPPED
ON VATICAN PHONE CALLS BEFORETHE CONCLAVE, THAT TOP SECRET
MEETING OF CARDINALS.
>> #01: FOLKS.
I AM A DEVOUT CATHOLIC BUT IBELIEVE THE NSA MUST SPY ON THE
VATICAN, THEY ARE TAPPING THEDIRECT LINE TO GOD.
AND AS I HAVE POINTED OUT, THISGUY HAS GOT A BEARD, SPENT A LOT
OF TIME IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND IKEEP HEARING HE HAS GOT SOME
"PLAN" THAT FOR SOME REASONALWAYS INVOLVES YOUR GRANDPA
DYING.
BUT SADLY, SADLY, THERE AREMISGUIDED CRITICS OUT THERE WHO
VALUE SOMETHING MORE THAN TOTALOPERATIONAL AND SITUATIONAL
AWARENESS.
LET'S GO DOWN.
>> UTTERLY OUT OF CONTROL.
>> THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCEBETWEEN PRIVACY AND SECURITY.
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS SIMPLYGOT THE BALANCE WRONG.
TOO MUCH INVASION OF PRIVACY INTHE PURSUIT OF SECURITY.
>> #01:.
>> COME ON WHAT IS THE BIG DEALABOUT A GOVERNMENT INVASION OF
PRIVACY, AT THIS POINT WE HAVEINVADED EVERYWHERE ELSE.
THANKFULLY, THERE IS A WAY TOKEEP THE NSA SPYING PROGRAM
ALIVE WHILE STILL MAINTAININGAMERICA'S SENSE OF PRIVACY AND
THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'SWORD.
THE.
>> Colbert: SEE NO EVIL, THISWEEK THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY HELD HEARINGS ON THENATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM, I
HOPE AL QAEDA DOESN'T WATCHC-SPAN.
>> NOW, ONE WITNESS, AMERICANUNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR STEPHEN
LAD DACK CLAIMS THE NSA PROGRAMVIOLATED THE FOURTH AMENDMENT,
NOW, LUCKILY, MICHIGANREPRESENTATIVE AND MEATLOAF
STUNT DOUBLE MIKE ROGERSCOUNTERED WITH THE LATEST IN
JUSTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY.
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT MAYBE THEFACT THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY
COMPLAINTS COME FORWARD WITH ANYSPECIFICITY, ARGUING THAT THEIR
PRIVACY HAS BEEN VIOLATEDCLEARLY INDICATES IN TEN YEARS,
CLEARLY INDICATES THAT SOMETHINGMUST BE DOING RIGHT, SOMEBODY
MUST BE DOING SOMETHING EXACTLYRIGHT.
>> Colbert: YEAH, FOR TENYEARS NO ONE COMPLAINED ABOUT
THE THING THEY DIDN'T KNOWEXISTED.
NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, THATIS SOUND LOGIC TO ME.
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER FOR THAT,PROFESSOR?
>> BUT WHO WOULD BE COMPLAINING?
>> SOMEBODY WHOSE PRIVACY WASVIOLATED.
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR PRIVACYVIOLATED IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR
PRIVACY IS VIOLATED, RIGHT?
>> Colbert: RIGHT.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR PRIVACYWAS VIOLATED THEN IT WASN'T.
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE IF YOUDON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
FOLKS, IT IS JUST LIKE, IT ISJUST LIKE WHEN SOMEONE LIES TO
YOU, TECHNICALLY THEY ARETELLING YOU THE TRUTH AS LONG AS
YOU NEVER FIND OUT IT WAS A LIE.
REALLY, IN THE END, IT IS REALLYAN ISSUE OF TRUST.
FOR EXAMPLE, I TRUST THAT MYCHILDHOOD DOG SKIP IS HAVING FUN
CHASING RABBITS AT THAT FARMUPSTATE.
THAT REMIND ME, HAPPY 41STBIRTHDAY, SKIPPER, I HOPE YOU
GOT THAT BONE I SENT YOU.
NOW, CONGRESSMAN ROGERS, IBELIEVE GETS IT.
PRIVACY IS NOT SOME PHYSICALTHING THAT YOU CAN HAVE OR NOT
HAVE VIOLATED.
IT IS A STATE OF MIND LIKE ZEN.
PROFESSOR VLADEK, HE, CERTAINLYEVEN YOU AGREE WITH THAT.
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
I THINK IF THE TREE FALLS IN THEFOREST AND MAKES A NOISE WHETHER
YOU ARE THERE OR NOT.
>> Colbert: YES, IT MAKES ANOISE AT THE, THAT THE NSA WAS
LISTENING TO.
AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THETREE NEVER FIND OUT.
OR, RATHER, RATHER, LET ME GIVEYOU ANOTHER TREE ANALOGY.
LET'S SAY INSTEAD OF FALLING INTHE FOREST THE TREE IS STANDING
OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE AND I AMHIDING IN IT WATCHING YOU
SHOWER.
NOW, SO FAR, SO FAR, I AM NOTVIOLATING YOUR PRIVACY, BUT THE
SECOND YOU SEE ME THROUGH THEWINDOW, SUDDENLY I AM THE
CRIMINAL?  WHAT ABOUT MY PRIVACYANY AM TRYING THOMAS BAIT HERE.
>> I AM TRYING TO MASTURBATEHERE.
>> NOW, COME TO THINK OF IT ..
>> NOW, THERE ARE REALLY ALLSORTS OF VICTIMLESS CRIMES LIKE
THIS.
WE KNOW PEOPLE GET ASSAULTEDBECAUSE THEY CALL THE POLICE,
BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONECALLING THE COMES BECAUSE THEY
WERE MURDERED.
THEREFORE, CLEARLY, NO ONE WASKILLED.
NOW, BY THE SAME LOGIC, BY THESAME LOGIC, FOLKS, I HAVE NOT
INSULTED MIKE ROGERS AS LONG ASHE NEVER HEARS ME SAY THE REASON
MIKE ROGERS USES CIRCULAR LOGICIS BECAUSE HIS HEAD IS JAMMED UP
HIS OWN ASS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Colbert: OF COURSE,
OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT MEAN A WORDOF THAT, I ADMIRE WHAT
HISTORIANS WILL NOW CALL THEROGERS DOCTRINE.
WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY VERSUSSECURITY, WE CAN HAVE ONE OF
THEM AS LONG AS WE DON'T KNOWWHICH ONE IT IS.
THAT WAY, WE CAN MAINTAIN OURCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OR IF THEY
DO TAKE AWAY OUR RIGHTS JUSTDON'T LET US FIND OUT.
THAT WAY, WE WILL STILL HAVETHEM.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>>
