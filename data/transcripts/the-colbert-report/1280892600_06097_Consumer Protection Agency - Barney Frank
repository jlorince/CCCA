BUDDY.
NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I AM STILL SEETHING OVER THE
FINANCIAL REGULATION BILL
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW
LAST MONTH.
AND TO THINK HE SIGNED IT IN THE
RONALD REAGAN BUILDING.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S LIKE CELEBRATING HANUKKAH
IN THE RICHARD NIXON BUILDING.
THE LEGISLATION CREATES A
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION
BUREAU, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM DECEPTION
AND ABUSES BY THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES INDUSTRY.
NOW, YES, BANKS ABUSE THEIR
CUSTOMERS, BUT CUSTOMERS DON'T
NEED A NEW AGENCY.
JUST A SAFE WORD.
LIKE "PUMPKIN PATCH."
JUST SHOUT THAT AND THE WEST BANK
KNOWS TO TAKE THE CLAMP OFF YOUR
BALLS.
FOLKS...
[LAUGHTER]
WE ALREADY HAVE THE F.D.A.
TELLING ME I CAN'T GET VITAMIN C
FROM EATING ORANGE PAINT CHIPS,
AND NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A
CONSUMER PROTECTION CZAR?
>> IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY
POWERFUL POSITION WITH AN
INCREDIBLY LARGE BUDGET AND
AUTHORITY THAT IS CONSTRAINED BY
ALMOST NOTHING.
>> Stephen: YES, A HUGE BUDGET
AND NO CONSTRAINT ON AUTHORITY.
THAT KIND OF UNCHECKED POWER
MUST BE RESERVED FOR OPRAH.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS
LIKE BARNEY FRANK WANT OBAMA TO
PICK FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND DAMN
FINE-LOOKING REGULATOR ELIZABETH
WARREN.
>> I NEVER HAD A BETTER PARTNER
ON A TOUGH FIGHT THAN I HAD IN
ELIZABETH WARREN, AND HER
KNOWLEDGE IS GREAT.
HER COMPASSION IS GREAT.
SHE STANDS OUT AS THE PERSON WHO
OUGHT TO BE RUNNING THAT AGENCY.
>> Stephen: WOW.
GET A SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ROOM
ALREADY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOLKS, WARREN IS CLEARLY
PREJUDICED AGAINST LENDERS.
>> TYPICAL CREDIT CARD CONTRACT
TODAY IS MORE THAN 30 PAGES
LONG.
BACK IN 1980 IT WAS ABOUT A PAGE
AND A HALF LONG.
NOW, THAT ADDITIONAL 28 PAGES IS
MOSTLY FULL OF TRICKS AND TRAPS.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
TRICKS AND TRAPS?
MY CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT IS
PERFECTLY CLEAR.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR
CONTROVERSY, WHETHER CONTRACT,
REGULATORY, TORT, OTHERWISE OR
WHETHER PREEXISTING, PRESENT OR
FUTURE AND INCLUDING
CONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY,
COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT AND
EXIT CANNABLE CLAIM ARISING FROM
OR RELATED TO, A, THE CREDIT
OFFER RELATED TO YOU, B, THE
ACTIONS OF YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
CONNECTED WITH THE ACCOUNT, C,
THE APPLICABILITY OR ARGUABILITY
OF THIS CLAIM MUST AFTER AN
ELECTION BY YOU OR US BE
RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
ARBITRATION PROVISION AND THE
COMMERCIAL OR OTHER APPLICABLE
ARBITRATION RULES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT JUST MEANS IF I DON'T MAKE
MY PAYMENTS ON TIME, I HAVE TO
CONFESS TO THE MURDER OF A
DRIFTER.
[LAUGHTER]
SO WARREN IS THE WRONG PERSON
FOR THE JOB.
BUT IS THE JOB EVEN NECESSARY?
HERE TO DEFEND CODDLING
CONSUMERS, PLEASE WELCOME THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL
SERVICES COMMITTEE AND MY DEAR
FRIEND CONGRESSMAN BARNEY FRANK.
MR. FRANK, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, SIR, WHY DO WE EVEN NEED
THIS CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY?
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 18 MONTHS
SINCE THE WORLD ECONOMY ALMOST
MELTED DOWN.
THINGS ARE FINE.
>> WELL, THIS IS IN PART TO MAKE
SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
AGAIN OR AS NEARLY SURE AS WE
CAN BE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH
THE CONSUMER ABUSES, FOR
INSTANCE IN THE MORTGAGE AREA,
IS THAT THEY DIDN'T JUST HURT
THE CONSUMERS, ALTHOUGH YOU
WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE REASON
ENOUGH TO RESPOND, BUT TAKEN
TOGETHER, THEY HAD A SYSTEMATIC
IMPACT.
IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN A LOT OF
BAD MORTGAGE LOANS WERE MADE TO
A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IN
CONSEQUENCE AD WILL THE OF
MORTGAGES GO BROKE, THE ECONOMY
IS AN ECONOMY-WIDE PROBLEM.
ISN'T THIS JUST ANOTHER
NANNY STATE OVERREACH BY THE
GOVERNMENT?
IF THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE
RALLY WORRIED ABOUT MORTGAGE
BUNDLING OR A.T.M. FEE, WOULDN'T
THEY HAVE SAID SO IN THE
CONSTITUTION IN
>> WELL, ACTUALLY THE FOUNDING
FATHERS TALKED ABOUT BUNDLING,
BUT THEY MEANT SOMETHING MORE
CENTRAL.
>> Stephen: I'VE HEARD ABOUT
IT A LOT.
>> YESMENT I DO THINK THE NANNY
STATE SHOULD BE RESISTED.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT THERE TO
BE CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR PEOPLE
WHO CHOOSE TO SMOKE MARIJUANA
FOR PERSONAL USE.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY NANNYISH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SMOKING
RIGHT NOW?
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.
IN NO WAY.
IT'S NOT THE NANNY STATE.
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING AND SPEND
YOUR MONEY FOOLISHLY, WE AREN'T
TRYING TO STOP YOU, BUT WE THINK
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EVERYTHINGMENT
YOU SHOULDN'T BE CONFRONTED WITH
HIDDEN SITUATION, THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T BE ENTRAPPED INTO A
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE NO
CHOICE AND YOUR MONEY IS TAKEN
FROM YOU.
>> Stephen: SIR, THAT'S JUST
THE NATURE OF BANKS.
THAT'S LIKE ASKING A TIGER TO
CHANGE ITS STRIPES OR TO
PENALIZE A SHARK FOR HAVING
TEETH.
>> NO, UH...
>> Stephen: YES, UH...
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE TROUBLE IS ANALOGIES LIKE
THAT MAKE NO SENSE.
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT MAKE NO
SENSE TO YOU BECAUSE I JUST WON.
>> NEW YORK I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT.
BANKS ARE AREN'T TIGERS.
CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS STRIPES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, THEY'RE
GRIZZLY BEARS DEVOURING OUR
CHILDREN.
>> METAPHORS CAN GET PEOPLE
CARRIED AWAY.
>> Stephen: DON'T THE BANKS
DESERVE SOME PROTECTION ALSO?
BANKS ARE CONSUMERS.
THEY CONSUME OUR LIFE SAVINGS
WHEN WE DON'T READ THE FINE
PRINT.
>> NO, BANKS DO GET A LOT OF
PROTECTION.
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE
PARTICULARLY REGULATE BANKS.
IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY GET
PROTECTION THAT WE ARE ENTITLED
TO ASK IN RETURN.
AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHY YOU CAN'T TELL THE
DISBETWEEN CHASE MANHATTAN AND A
TIGER.
I'D BE VERY CAREFUL.
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD BE VERY
CAREFUL GOING TO THE ZOO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
SIR, NOW, WHY DO YOU LIBERALS
LOVE ELIZABETH WARREN SO MUCH,
DESPITE THE FACT SHE'S A DAMN
FINE LOOKING WOMAN.
YOU'D AGREE WITH ME THERE,
WOULDN'T YOU?
>> YES, BUT YOU DO REALIZE THAT
WOULD NOT BE MY MOTIVATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE FACT IS SHE'S IMPORTANT
BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE A GREAT
ADMINISTRATOR OF THAT AGENCY,
WHICH SHE HELPED CREATE.
SHE IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY
ZEALOUS PRAGMATIST.
SHE HAS A DEDICATION TO A SET OF
ISSUES AND A GREAT WAY OF
ACCOMPLISHING THEM.
AND I THINK WE NEED MORE
EXAMPLES OF THAT.
>> WELL, THEN WHY HAS THE WHITE
HOUSE SO FAR NOT HEEDED CALL?
WHY WOULD SENATOR DODD SAY SHE
MAY NOT BE CONFIRMABLE?
>> THE ARGUMENT YOU CAN EASILY
BE CONFIRMED IN THE SENATE, I
DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ARGUMENT
IN FAVOR OF YOU.
>> ELIZABETH WARREN FIRST PUT
THIS IDEA OUT THERE IN A
MAGAZINE ARTICLE.
DO YOU AND THE OTHER DEMOCRATS
BLINDLY FOLLOW EVERYTHING YOU
READ IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES?
BECAUSE I'D LIKE THE KNOW WHO IS
HEADING UP THE CONGRESSIONAL
SUBCOMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE
WHETHER STARS ARE JUST LIKE US?
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAR,
STEPHEN?
>> Stephen: OF COURSE I AM.
AND I NO I'M NOT LIKE YOU.
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY STARS ARE
JUST LIKE US?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT
MEANS OR WANT.
TO
>> Stephen: LAST QUESTION.
DOES SHE GET THE NOD?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE GETS THE
NOD.
I HOPE SHE GETS THE JOB I'VE
NEVER BEEN SURE WHAT A NOD IS.
BUT I AM PUSHING HARD FOR HER TO
GET THE JOB.
>> Stephe
