EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN A
SIGNATURE IN PENNSYLVANIA
GOVERNMENT "MORE" THAN THREE
DECADES, AND HE'S NOT EVEN A BEN
FRANKLIN IMPERSONATOR.
PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR ED
RENDELL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LEFT THE DOME
OPEN TONIGHT, SIR.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
SIR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING BACK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK.
>> Stephen: YOU CALLED AMERICA
A LAND OF WUSSES.
WHAT'S YOUR BILL OF GOODS?
WHAT'S YOUR LIST OF GRIEVANCES
WITH AMERICA AND ITS
WUSSIFICATION?
>> WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TIME, STEPHEN, TO GO INTO ALL
THESE THINGS.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LISTEN TO AN
ADVERTISEMENT FOR A PERFECTLY
MUNDANE PRODUCT, YOU'RE SCARED
TO TAKE IT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT PHARMACEUTICALS?
>> ANYTHING.
WE'RE SO AFRAID OF LIABILITY.
WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYTHING
DONE ANYMORE.
LOOK AT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHINA.
CHINA IS KICKING OUR BUTT
VIRTUALLY IN EVERY FIELD OF
ENDEAVOR.
WHY?
>> Stephen: I AGREE, WE SHOULD
STAND UP TO CHINA AND MATCH THEM
TOE FOR TOE.
I SAY GET RID OF OUR CHILD LABOR
LAWS.
GET OUR KIDS BACK OUT THERE.
HAVE OUR PRISONERS MAKE OUR
TOYS.
I'M WITH YOU ON THIS ONE.
>> LOOK, ALL THAT'S WELL AND
GOOD, BUT CHINA...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: I'M SO GLAD YOU
AGREE WITH ME.
>> CHINA IS, NUMBER ONE,
STEALING OUR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY, NO JOKE.
>> Stephen: MY SHOW IS
BOOTLEGGED OVER THERE LIKE
CRAZY.
THEY LOVE IT.
>> THEY ACTUALLY LIKE THIS SHOW?
>> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT TRANSLATES.
>> SECONDLY THEY'RE MANIPULATING
THEIR CURRENCY TO RUIN OUR
ECONOMY.
THIRD THEY'RE DUMPING PIPE TO
GET THE STEEL BUSINESS HERE...
>> Stephen: THIS IS FAMILY
SHOW.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN SAY
"COUPLING PIPE."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> THEY'RE PUTTING CHEAP STEEL
INTO THE U.S. AND WE'RE NOT...
BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID OF CHINA,
WE'RE NOT CALLING THEM FOR --
DUTCHING IS A TERM THAT MEANS
THEY'RE PUTTING IT AT LOW
PRICES.
IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: THE PIPE IS THE
STEEL.
DUMPING PIPE IS MUCH BETTER THAN
PIPING DUMP.
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW
AMERICA... THAT'S CHINA BEING
TOUGH.
HOW ARE WE US BRUCEING OUT.
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT BUT I LIKE YOU
BECAUSE YOU TOOK A SINGLE GAME
BEING MOVED TWO NIGHTS AND
DECLARED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS
WUSSIES AS A RESULT.
THAT'S BOLD.
BUT HOW IS AMERICA WUSSIES IN
OTHER WAYS?
>> WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT CHINA BECAUSE
THEY HOLD OUR DEBT AND WE'RE
SCARED TO DEATH OF THEM.
>> Stephen: DON'T SAY THAT TOO
LOUD BECAUSE THEY MIGHT CASH
THAT CHECK SOME DAY.
>> NO, BECAUSE IF THEY RENDER
OUR ECONOMY WORTHLESS, WHAT'S
THE DEATH WORTH?
NOT MUCH.
>> Stephen: HAVE WE TRAPPED
THEM?
>> I THINK IN SOME INSIDIOUS WAY
WE HAVE, NO QUESTION.
>> Stephen: HOW INSCRUTABLE OF
US.
>> LOOK, WE'RE A COUNTRY THAT
WAS BASED ON RISK-TAKERS.
THE ORIGINAL FOUNDING FATHERS
DIDN'T HAVE A SHOT OF BEATING
THE MOST POWERFUL ARMY IN THE
WORLD.
WE WERE FARMERS AND SHOPKEEPERS,
AND THEY SIGNED OUR NAME ON A
BILL THAT SAID, "IF WE LOSE,
WE'RE GOING TO BE EXECUTED."
AND THEY TOOK THE RISK BECAUSE
THEY BELIEVED IN SOMETHING.
WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST THAT
PIONEERING SPIRIT, THE
ADVENTURESOME SPIRIT, OUR
COURAGE.
I THINK IT'S TO THE DETRIMENT OF
THE COUNTRY.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A FOOTBALL
GAME, ALTHOUGH WHEN THEY
CANCELED THAT GAME, STEPHEN, NOT
ONE DROP OF SNOW HAD FALLEN IN
PHILADELPHIA.
AT GAME TIME, WE HAD...
>> Stephen: SO FOOTBALL NOW
IS, THERE'S A FOAM CHAIN.
I WOULD HAVE JUST PLAYED THAT
GAME AND ASSIGNED THE SNOWPLOW
AS THE ENTIRE DEFENSIVE LINE.
>> INTERESTINGLY, 1947...
>> Stephen: I REMEMBER.
>> THE EAGLES PLAYED FOR NFL
CHAMPIONSHIP IN 13 INCHES OF
SNOW.
GUESS WHAT, NOBODY THOUGHT OF
KANSASING THE GAME.
YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S IN CRYING
IN BASEBALL?
THERE WAS NO CANCELLING GAMES IN
FOOTBALL FOR BAD WEATHER.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS NEXT FOR
ED RENDELL?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN GOVERNOR?
>> EIGHT YEARS.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT RUN AGAIN,
SIR?
>> WE HAVE TERM LIMITS IN
PENNSYLVANIA.
>> Stephen: WE HAD TERM LIMITS
HERE AND BLOOMBERG DIDN'T CARE.
BLOOMBERG JUST SAID, I'LL TAKE
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE, PLEASE.
WHEN HE LEFT, HE SAID, YOU
SHOULD PUT THOSE TERM LIMITS
BACK INCH AREN'T YOU WUSSING OUT
WE NOT RUNNING AGAIN EVEN THOUGH
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
>> YOU CAN INTERPRET IT THAT
WAY.
>> Stephen: I JUST DID, SIR.
>> I ALSO THINK I'VE BEEN AN
ELECTED OFFICIAL FOR 24 YEARS.
I THINK IT'S TIME.
IT'S TIME.
I'VE SPENT SO MOST OF MY LIFE
WORRYING ABOUT THE WELFARE OF
12.5 MILLION PEOPLE.
NOW I'M GOING TO GET UP IN THE
MORNING AND I'LL BE WORRYING
ABOUT THE WELFARE OF ONE PERSON,
ME.
>> Stephen: WOW.
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
( APPLAUSE )
>> YOU KNOW WHAT MY BIGGEST
CHALLENGE IS GOING FORWARD?
LEARNING HOW THE DRIVE.
IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE I'VE
DRIF AN CAR.
THINK ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: LET ME TELL YOU,
IF YOU HIT ICE, GUN IT AND JACK
THE WHEEL.
YOU GOT BURN THE ICE OFF THE
SURFACE.
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> YOU GOT TO HELP ME OUT.
WHICH ONE IS THE GAS PEDAL AND
WHICH ONE IS THE BREAK?
>> JUST DOUBLE FOOT IT.
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
GOVERNOR RENDELL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING US.
GOVERNOR ED
