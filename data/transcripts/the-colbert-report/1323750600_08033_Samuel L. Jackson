YOUR WORK EVER SINCE, REALLY
"JURASSIC PARK", THAT IS

NIGHT BEFORE HE IS
ASSASSINATED.
>> Stephen: HE HAS JUST
GIVEN THE I HAVE BEEN TO THE
MOUNTAINTOP SPEECH.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: CAN I TAKE ISSUE
WITH YOU FOR A SECOND.
>> GO AHEAD, KNOCK YOURSELF
OUT.
>> Stephen: MY UNDERSTANDING
IS THIS PLAY HUMANIZES KING.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: WHY, WHY WOULD
YOU WANT TO HUMANIZE A HERO
LIKE THAT?
IT'S MARTIN LUTHER KING, NOT
MARTIN LUTHER HUMAN.
>> I FEEL YOU, I FEEL YOU, I
GET THAT, I GET THAT.
>> Stephen: DON'T WE NEED
LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURES?
>> WELL, WE HAVE HEROES BUT
WE LOOK AT THEM, WE SEE THEM
GIVING SPEECHES.
WE HAVE THIS HUGEnA NEW
MEMORIAL AND EVERYTHING
ELSE.
>> Stephen: ON THE MALL, I
HAVE SEEN THAT BEEN THERE
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> DID YOU LIKE THAT T
DIDN'T LOOK KIND OF ASIAN TO
YOU.
>> I'M SORRY.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE
RACE.
>> YES, DOW.
>> Stephen: NO I DO NOT SEE
RACE.
>> YOU DON'T SEE RACE.
>> Stephen: I DON'T HE ARE
YOU A BLACK MAN?
>> NO, BUT I HEARD ABOUT THE
GRAPPLE BABY, THAT LOOKED
PRETTY RACIST TO ME.
>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NOR, I SEE NATIONALITY,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY EDUCATING
YOUNG PEOPLE AND I GUESS
OTHER PEOPLE TO THE FACT
THAT DR. KING WAS UNDER A
LOT OF PRESSURE AS THAT ICON
THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> THAT HAD FEARS.
HE WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT OF HIS IMMINENT DEATH.
HE KNEW HE WAS BEING
FOLLOWED AND HARASSED BY THE
FBI.
HE WAS A LOVING FAMILY MAN
WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AWAY
FROM HIS FAMILY.
SOW SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON
THE PHONE TALKING TO THEM.
AND WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO
KNOW THAT THE SACRIFICE HE
MADE WAS A GREAT ONE, AS AN
INDIVIDUAL, AND NOT
JUST-- THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN
A FEW PEOPLE LIKE HIM ON THE
PLANET, RIGHT, AGREE WITH
THAT, RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I THINK HE IS AN
EXTRAORDINARY MAN,
EXTRAORDINARY MAN.
>> nd YOU GOT JESUS, GANDHI,
MARTIN LUTHER KING.
>> Stephen: RONALD REAGAN.
>> RONALD REAGAN I-- .
>> Stephen: ARE YOU, BY THE
WAY, THIS IS A SERIOUS
QUESTION I ASKED BEFORE, ARE
YOU AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
BECAUSE AS I SAID, I TOOK
KING'S LESSON TO HEART AND I
DON'T SEE THE COLOR OF
EVERYONE'S SKIN.
I ONLY SEE THE CONTENT OF
THEIR CHARACTER.
>> REALLY?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> AWESOME.
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE
THAT LUXURY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> NO, NO I'M NOT A RACIST
BUT I SEE RACE BECAUSE I
WANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S
GOING ON AND CULTURAL
BACKGROUND IS VERY
IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen: WE TALK ABOUT
RACE.
WE MAKE IT, WE MAKE RACISM
WORSE.
>> WELL, I MEANS THAT'S LIKE
SAYING-- WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I LIKE THE WAY YOU BIND
YOURSELF TO THAT.
>> Stephen: WELL, I HAVE TO.
BECAUSE RACISM IS SO
TEMPTING.
>> REALLY?
>> Stephen: OH, ABSOLUTELY,
RACIVE.
IS SO TEMPTING BECAUSE IF I
GET TO SAY HERE IS ME AND MY
GROUP AND WE'RE GREAT AND
YOUR GROUP ISN'T AS GOOD AS
MY GROUP, THAT IS A VERY
SEDUCTIVE FEELING, THAT I
DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO
BE BETTER, I CAN JUST SAY I
AM BETTER BY THE VIRTUE OF
MY RACE.
IT'S A VERY LAZY WAY OF
THINKING.
>> REALLY.
>> Stephen: SO I HAVE TO
BLIND MYSELF TO THE REALITY
OF PEOPLE'S SKIN COLOR SO I
HAVE TO EARN THE FACT THAT
I'M BETTER THAN EVERYONE.
SEE, AND AGAIN YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ME WHETHER YOU ARE A
BLACK PERSON OR NOT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S
YOUR RIGHT.
THAT'S YOUR RIGHT TO NOT
TELL ME, IF THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
KNOW, THAT SAYS SOMETHING
VERY INTERESTING ABOUT YOU.
>> I'M NOT BLACK, WHITE OR
ANYTHING.
I'M A MOVIE STAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELL THAT-- THAT
THAT-- THAT IS ONE GROUP I
WOULDN'T MIND BELONGING TO.
DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?
>> TOTALLY DOPE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
IT'S A FEELING I CAN'T
EXPLAIN TO ANYBODY.
I TRY AND ACT LIKE IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.
BUT IT'S A PRETTY BIG
[BLEEP] DEAL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE ON
BROADWAY WITH THE GREAT
ANGELA BASSETT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE A BROADWAY STAR?
>> ITS PHENOMENAL.
I DID THEATRE FOR 19, 20
YEARS BEFORE I GOT
DISCOVERED.
AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE
FEELING OF BEING IN FRONT OF
A LIVE AUDIENCE AND SHARING
THE ENERGY.
LIKE BEING WITH THESE GUYS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THE LIVE, THE SHARING OF
ENERGY BETWEEN US.
>> Stephen: I WANT TO SEE
WHAT THAT IS LIKE.
I THINK THESE GUYS ARE THE
GREATEST AUDIENCE IN THE
WORLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT DOES FEEL
FANTASTIC.
>> SO WHAT I AM TRYING TO
FIND OUT THOUGH IS IT'S NOT
A WORD.
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS
ANYWAY.
SO-- BECAUSE YOUR MOM WAS A
FREEDOM MARCHER.
>> Stephen: MY MOTHER WAS AT
THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON IN
1963.
>> REALLY?
ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND YOU WERE
INSIDE THE WOMB.
>> Stephen: YES, SHE WAS
PREGNANT WITH ME, YOU GOT
ALL THESE NONRACIAL
VIEWINGS.
>> I THINK THAT'S YES DON'T
SEE-- THAT I SOAK IN KING'S
DREAM.
>> THROUGH THE WAFFLE OF THE
PLACENTA.
>> RIGHT ON, RIGHT ON, RIGHT
ON.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> AND WHERE WAS YOUR DAD.
>> Stephen: IF YOU WEREN'T
THERE YET.
>> WHERE WAS YOUR DAD.
>> Stephen: HE WAS WORKING.
HE WAS WORKING.
OH, I SEE YOU ARE IMPLYING
THAT MY MOTHER WAS MARRIED
TO A CLASSMAN,-- YOU ARE
IMPLYING THAT MY MOTHER WAS
MARRIED TO A BLACK MAN.
>> I CAN FEEL THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT IS THE VIBE
YOU ARE GETTING OFF ME.
>> I CAN TELL YOU GOT
RHYTHM.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE
CONTENT, LISTEN, AS A
POSSIBLE HALF BLACK MAN, I
AM OFFENDED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SAMUEL L. JACKSON,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
