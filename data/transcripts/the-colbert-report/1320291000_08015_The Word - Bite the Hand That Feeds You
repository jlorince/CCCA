NATION,LET OCCUPY WITH THE
MOVEMENT HAS BEEN GOING ON
NEARLY TWO MONTHS NOW, AND I'M
STILL NOT SURE WHAT THEY WANT.
BASED ON ALL THE DRUMMING, I'M
GUESSING THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE
SAX TO COME IN.
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS
GOTTEN THEIR WHITE BOY DREADS IN
A BUNCH IS THE SO-CALLED INCOME
GAP.
AND IT'S ONLY GETTING SO-CALLED
WORSE.
IN FACT, AMERICA NOW HAS AN
INCOME GAP SIMILAR TO THE
PHILIPPINES AND MEXICO.
SOUNDS BAD, BUT IT COULD MEAN
WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE A BOOM IN OUR
COCKFIGHTING INDUSTRY.
THE FREE MARKET HAS CONFIRMED
THAT THE GAP EXISTS BECAUSE
PROCTOR & GAMBLE HAS FOUND THE
CONSUMER MARKET ERODING IN THE
MIDDLE, AND AS A RESULT, HAVE
BEGUN AIMING ADVERTISING
DIRECTLY AT THE HIGH- AND
LOW-END MARKETS WITH PRODUCTS
LIKE NEW BARGAIN DISH SOAP.
YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY SUCKS WHEN
DAWN IS NOW A STATUS SYMBOL.
( LAUGHTER ).
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN ONLY AFFORD
DUSK.
( APPLAUSE )
BUT THESE OCCUPY WALL STREET
CRAZIES ARE BLAME THE WRONG
PEOPLE BECAUSE WE 1%ERS ARE THE
ONLY ONES WHO CAN HELP THEM.
>> LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER WORD
FOR MILLIONAIRE-- JOB CREATORS.
>> OUR JOB CREATORS ARE WEALTHY.
LET'S FACE IT.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HIRED BY A
POOR PERSON?
>> Stephen:  YES, BUT I WAS
YOUNG AND IT WAS DARK AND I
REALLY NEEDED MONEY FOR A BUS
TICKET HOME.
BUT, FOLKS, WITH THIS ANGRY MOB
GROWING OUT THERE, I AM WORRIED
WE COULD BE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO
CHANGING SOMETHING.
LAW ENFORCEMENT LAUGH SO WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO THROW THESE
HAVE-NOT A BONE, AND THAT BRINGS
US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
"BITE THE HAND THAT FEED YOU."
FOLKS, PROCTOR & GAMBLE ISN'T
THE ONLY COMPANY CHANGING ITS
MARKETING PLAN.
THE GOOD FOLKS AT PURINA HAVE
RELEASED THE FIRST AD CAMPAIGN
TARGETED DIRECTLY AT DOGS.
THEY'RE DEBUTING IN AUSTRIA, AND
FEATURE SQUEAKS AND BELLS THAT
HUMANS MAY NOT NOTICE BUT DOGS
CANNOT RESIST.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WOW.
THAT AD IS EFFECTIVE.
WHOEVER CAME UP WITH IT, I WOULD
LIKE TO SNIFF YOUR BUTT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, THE IDEA-- THE IDEA IS THAT
PET OPENERS WATCH THEIR DOGES
ENJOY THE ADS AND PAY EXTRA FOR
PREMIUM DOG FOOD.
AND, FOLKS, THERE IS A REAL
REASON TO APPEAL TO THE FIDO
DEMO.
>> TOUGH ECONOMY, THOARKS DOES
HAVE AMERICANS CUTTING CORNERS
IN NOT ONE PART OF THEIR LIFE,
AT LEAST, PAMPERING THEIR PETS.
AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BE
SPENDING MORE THAN $50 BILLION
ON THEIR ANIMALS THIS YEAR.
>> Stephen:  $50 BILLION.
WE'D BE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO
BAIL OUT THE GREEKS IF THEY HAD
WET NOSES AND FLOPPY EARS.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW, I KNOW-- FOLKS, I KNOW I
WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR MY DOG,
GIPPER.
HE LOVES TO CHASE SQUIRRELS, SO
I RELEASED HUNDREDS OF THEM INTO
MY HOUSE.
WHICH REMINDS ME-- "GET RABIES
SHOTS."
YOU SEE, PETS, PETS OF WEALTHY
AMERICANS APPEAR TO HAVE MORE
DISPOSABLE INCOME THAN MOST POOR
PEOPLE.
SO IF WE WANT TO REALLY CLOSE
THE INCOME GAP, THERE IS A
SIMPLE ANSWER-- THE POOR SHOULD
BECOME RICH PEOPLE'S PETS.
( LAUGHTER )
AFTER ALL-- HEAR ME OUT-- AFTER
ALL, 30% OF THE POOR ARE
UNINSURED.
MEANWHILE, 800,000 PETS IN THE
NATION HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE TO
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GET SICK.
AND HEALTH CARE, FOLKS, IS JUST
ONE OF THE BENEFITS.
YOU GET A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD,
PLENTY OF EXERCISE, AND YOUR
MEALS ARE LOADED WITH CHUNKS OF
REAL BEEF LIPS.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S THE LEAST-- IT'S THE LEAST
WE CAN DO BECAUSE WE RICH HAVE A
MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE ALARMING RISING NUMBER
OF POOR.
OH, WHICH REMINDS ME, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO BE SPAYED OR
NEUTERED.
NOW, OF COURSE--
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
OF COURSE, FOLKS, WE WILL NOT
NEUTER ALL OF YOU.
LET STRONG ONES WITH SILKY COATS
WE WILL BREED.
NOW, SOME, SOME RICH PEEP HAVE
ALLERGIES SO WE'LL NEED TO
CROSS-BREED A POOR PERSON WITH A
POOD TOLL CREATE A DESDA-TO
DOLE.
NOW, POOR FOLKS, WE JOB CREATORS
ARE OFFERING YOU A LIFE FULL THE
COMPASSION AND DIGNITY.
THAT'S IT.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
YOU POOR CAN BE OBEDIENT PETS,
OR YOU CAN BITE THE HAND THAT
FEEDS YOU, IN WHICH CASE, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO PUT YOU DOWN.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
CHEAPER
