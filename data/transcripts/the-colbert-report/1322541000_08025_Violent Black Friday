I'M JUST FINISHING SOME
ON-LINE HOLIDAY SHOPPING, A
NICE DEAL ON A KINDL FIRE,
THAT WILL MAKE A GREAT
COASTER FOR MY iPAD.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS, THERE AND DONE.
WITH CHRISTMAS.
OKAY.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, TODAY IS
CYBERMONDAY.
WHEN EVERYBODY MOBS THE
ON-LINE STORES FOR THE BIG
HOLIDAY SALES.
NOW TO BEAT THE RUSH LAST
NIGHT I CAMPED OUT IN FRONT
OF MY COMPUTER.
WAITING FOR THE INTERNET TO
OPEN.
CYBERMONDAY IS A FOLLOWUP TO
BLACK FRIDAY, THE DAY AFTER
THANKSGIVING WHEN AMERICANS
AWAKE FROM THEIR TRYPTOPHAN
INDUCED COMA TO TRADE
GLUTTONY FOR GREED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW FOLKS, THIS
WEEKEND WAS A CATEGORY 5
CONSUME-ICANE WITH AMERICANS
SPENDING OVER $52 BILLION.
NATION, THIS ORGY OF
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING PROVES
AMERICA IS BACK!
WE ARE ONCE AGAIN--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YES, OH YES, WE
ARE ONCE AGAIN SPENDING
MONEY WE DON'T HAVE ON
THINGS WE DON'T NEED TO GIVE
TO PEOPLE WE DON'T LIKE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YES, U.S.A.,
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!
>> Stephen: OH, YES.
THAT'S LOUD ENOUGH FOR SANTA
TO HEAR YOU AT THE NORTH
POLE.
AND FOLKS, THIS CHRISTMAS WE
ARE PLAYING TO WIN.
JIM?
>> DOOR BUSTER SALES TURNED
VIOLENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> AN ARMED ROBBER
CONFRONTED A MAN AND HIS
FAMILY DEMANDING THEIR BLACK
FRIDAY PURCHASES.
>> SHOPPERS IN A NEAR RIOT.
YOU HEAR THE SCREAMING,
TRYING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON
SOME $2 WAFFLE IRONS.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT SOUNDS
OUTRAGE US BUT REMEMBER A $2
WAFFLE IRON CAN BE USED TO
BLUDGEON OTHERS WHEN ARE YOU
GOING FOR THAT $50 FLAT
SCREEN.
BUT FOLKS IF THAT'S TOO
VIOLENT FOR YOU THERE ARE
MORE PEACEFUL METHODS.
>> IN L.A. A WOMAN SPRAYED
FELLOW SHOPPERS WITH PEPPER
SPRAY TO TRY AND GET HER
HANDS ON AN XBOX.
>> Stephen: GOOD FOR HER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I SAY THE XBOX
PEOPLE SHOULD TURN THAT INTO
A GAME.
CALL OF DUTY BLACK FRIDAY
OFF.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE POINT IS-- THE
POINT IS YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
YOUR GIFTS BY ANY MEANS
NECESSARY.
BUT IT IS THE HOLIDAY SEASON
CELEBRATING JESUS, THE
PRINCE OF PEACE SO PLEASE
USE NONLETHAL FORCE ONLY.
PEPPER SPRAY, TEAR GAS, BEAN
BAG BULLETS AND TAZERS, ALL
OF WHICH I BELIEVE ARE
AVAILABLE AT WAL-MART.
