I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
JUST THE TRUTH.
>> NATHAN, WITH WEEKS TO GO
BEFORE THE CONVENTIONS, BOTH
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE
DOING ANYTHING FOR PUBLICITY.
FIRST OBAMA GOES ON A WORLD
TOUR.
THEN MCCAIN WASHES UP ON THE
SHORE IN MONTAUK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LAST WEEK, SENATOR MCCAIN --
LAST WEEK SENATOR MCCAIN
UNVEILED A NEW ATTACK AD CALLED
CELEBS.
>> HE'S THE BIGGEST CELEBRITY IN
THE WORLD.
IS HE READY TO LEAD?
>> EXACTLY.
ELECTING A CELEBRITY IS
SOMETHING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
WOULD NEVER DO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERS  ]
>> NOW CRITICS ARE SAYING THIS
IS THE LOWEST COMMON
DENOMINATETOR AND IT SMACKS OF
DESPERATION.
THE AD EVEN LED TO A FURIOUS
PHONE CALL FROM PARIS HILTON'S
GRANDFATHER.
APPARENTLY WHEN HE HEARD MCCAIN
HAD MADE A VIDEO OF PARIS, HE
ASSUMED THE WORST.
YES.
YES THE ENTIRE MEDIA IS CALLING
THIS AD A MISTAKE.
FOR ONCE, THEY ARE RIGHT.
WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S --
WE THE PEOPLE.
FOLKS, THIS AD IS A DISASTER FOR
THE MCCAIN CAMPAIGN.
SURE IT GETS ITS FACTS RIGHT.
FOR INSTANCE, THE FACT THAT ALL
CELEBRITIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME
SAME.
SO --
[ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SENATOR OWE BALM A.
PARIS HILTON AND -- SENATOR
OBAMA, PARIS HILTON, AND BRITNEY
SPEARS.
FIRST, ALL OF THEM ARE HOUNDED
BY THE PRESS.
THEY ALL LOOK GREAT ON CAMERA,
AND ALL THREE WERE PROFESSORS OF
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.
THEY HAD VERY POPULAR CLASSES.
AND WHO CAN FORGET PARIS'S
STUNNINGLY HONEST MEMOIRE, CASH
FROM MY FATHER?
SO, EVERYTHING IN THE AD WAS
TRUE, BUT IT WAS STILL A MISTAKE
FOR MCCAIN, BECAUSE WHILE I
ALREADY KNEW I'D NEVER VOTE FOR
BARACK OBAMA, I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH I LOVED TO VOTE FOR
BRITNEY SPEARS.
SHE WOULD BE THE PERFECT
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.
MCCAIN PROVED SHE'S JUST AS
QUALIFIED FOR BARACK OBAMA, AND
SHE HAS THE SAME STRONG POLICY
POSITIONS AS JOHN MCCAIN.
>> I THINK WE SHOULD JUST TRUST
OUR PRESIDENT IN EVERY DECISION
THAT HE MAKES.
>> WHAT A MAVERICK.
OF COURSE, THEY AREN'T EXACTLY
THE SAME.
I THINK BRITNEY KNOWS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUNNIS AND
SHIIA.
PLUS BRITNEY HAS GOT THE
NECESSARY TOUGHNESS.
MCCAIN MAY HAVE BEEN A PRISONER
OF WAR FOR FIVE YEARS, BUT
BRITNEY WAS A MOUSE CETTEER.
>> PLUS, BRITNEY IS VERY PRO
FAMILY.
SO, I SAY REPUBLICAN, IT IS NOT
TOO LATE TO DRAFT BRITNEY.
IMAGINE THE THRILL AT THE
CONVENTION WHEN SHE ACCEPTS YOUR
NOMINATION AND THEN TONGUES K.
BAILEY HUTCHINSON.
SENATOR MCCAIN, BECAUSE OF YOUR
OWN AD, YOUR ONLY HOPE IS TO
ACCEPT THIS NOMINATION WHILE
WEARING AN ALBINO SNAKE.
IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WILL MAKE
