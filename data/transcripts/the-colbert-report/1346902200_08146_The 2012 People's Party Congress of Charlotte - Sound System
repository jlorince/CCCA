( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT...
THAT... THAT (CROWD CHANTING "OBAMA")
>> YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO VOTE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE GOT TO SAY, AFTER AN OVATION LIKE
THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO BE SAID: I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION AS HOST OF THIS SHOW.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, FOLKS, WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,".
IT WAS NIGHT ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL DRUM CIRCLE LAST NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) AND I AM SAD TO SAY IT WAS A DISASTER.
(LAUGHTER) FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS BESET WITH TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES STARTING WITH THE AUDIO.
ALL NIGHT THERE WAS THIS CONSTANT BUZZING ROAR.
IT WAS LIKE...
(LAUGHTER).
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE.
JIMMY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH!
YEAH, THAT WAS IT!
WHAT WAS THAT?
(LAUGHTER) YOU CAN BARELY HEAR THE SPEECHES.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, I'LL TELL YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY KNOW HOW TO DO AUDIO.
AND MR. BRIT HUME KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> THIS HALL IS QUITE A BIT SMALLER THAN THE HALL THAT THE REPUBLICANS USED IN TAMPA AND
THE RESULT IS THAT THE NOISE THAT YOU HEAR FROM THE DELEGATES IS MUCH MAGNIFIED NATURALLY.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE DEMOCRATIC PLANNERS HERE HAVE CRANKED THE VOLUME ON THE SOUND
SYSTEM UP TO THE ABSOLUTE MAX SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HALL-- AND A NUMBER OF THE NETWORK
ANCHOR BOOTHS ARE OPEN TO THE HALL-- THE SOUND OF FROM THE FLOOR AND THE PLATFORM IS
ABSOLUTELY DEAFENING.
A SMALL THING BUT A SUGGESTION THEY DON'T QUITE HAVE THEIR ACT TOGETHER.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: CLEARLY.
CLEARLY THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR ACT TOGETHER.
I MEAN, I WATCHED IT, THAT WAS CACOPHONY OF UNBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM!
THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO MUTE THEIR JOY!
(LAUGHTER) AND I'M SORRY, THAT VOLUME OF PLEASURE IS JUST UNPROFESSIONAL.
THE FOX NEWS PEOPLE COULD BARELY HEAR THEMSELVES
