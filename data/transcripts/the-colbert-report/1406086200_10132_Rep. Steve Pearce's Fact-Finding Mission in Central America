>> Stephen: FOLKS, IF YOUARE WATCHING THE NEWS,
AND I HOPE YOU ARE BECAUSE ITHELPS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUTTONIGHT, WE
ARE ALL PAINFULLY AWARE OF THEONGOING TRAGEDY ALONG OUR
SOUTHERN BORDER.
DESPITE OUR BEST INTENTIONS, ITREMAINS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAIR AN
OUTFIT WITH TURQUOISE JEWELRY!
(LAUGHTER)DON'T BELIEVE THE MAN AT THE
KIOSK, YOU WILL LOOK LIKE ANEXTRA FROM DANCES WITH WOLVES
(LAUGHTER)ANOTHER BIG ISSUE FROM DOWN
THERE, THOUSANDS OF CENTRALAMERICAN CHILDREN POURING OVER
THE BORDER AND THE PRESIDENT ISDOING NOTHING TO STOP IT.
AND IT'S NO WONDER.
ALL THAT JUMPING AND RUNNING ONTRAINS, I'M SURE IT'S PART OF
THE FIRST LADY'S LET'S MOVECAMPAIGN.
FOR MONTHS NOW WE'VE BEEN SOLD ABILL OF GOODS THAT THESE KIDS
ARE FLEEING PLACES BACK HOMELIKE SAN PEDRO SULA, HONDURAS,
KNOWN AS THE MURDER CAPITALAROUND THE WORLD. THOUGH I AM
DUBIOUS OF THAT TITLE. THEY'REPROBABLY PADDING THE
NUMBERS BY LUMPING IN THE MURDERSUBURBS. SAN PEDRO SULA HEIGHTS
FORTUNATELY, CONGRESS SENT A7 MEMBER DELEGATION ON A FACT
FINDING MISSION TO HONDURAS ANDGUATEMALA. AND THE TRUTH
COULD NOT BE MORE WHAT I WANT ITTO BE. ACCORDING TO REP. PEARCE,
MOST IMMIGRANTS FROM CENTRALAMERICA ACCORDING TO THE
ARE DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC REASONSNOT FEAR OF
PHYSICAL DANGER IN THEIRHOMELAND.
THAT IS A WELCOME RELIEF.
THESE KIDS AREN'T WORRIED ABOUTVIOLENCE, ONLY ABOUT STARVATION.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST
PEARCE'S FINDINGS BECAUSE HECULTIVATED AN INTIMATE
UNDERSTANDING OF THE REGIONDURING A VISIT TO GUATEMALA AND
HONDURAS OVER THE COURSE OF THEWEEKEND.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED.
I LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE DESERTBY SPENDING A WEEKEND AT BURNING
MAN.
TURNS OUT THE DESERTIS FULL OF DRUGS AND IMPRACTICAL
BICYCLES.
AND CONGRESSMAN PEARCE FOUND NOEVIDENCE OF DANGER ANYWHERE HE
LOOKED, WHICH IT TURNS OUT WASMAINLY AROUND THE HOTEL LOBBY,
AS PEARCE SAID, HE AND THE RESTOF THE HOUSE DELEGATION DID NOT
VENTURE FROM THEIR HOTEL VERYOFTEN BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS.
(APPLAUSE)THE POINT IS --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BOTTOM LINE, THESE IMMIGRANT
CHILDREN ARE NOT REFUGEES,THEY'RE JUST PARASITES LOOKING
FOR JOBS, AND IF I WERE THEM IWOULD TRY TO GET ONE AT THAT
HOTEL BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT ISTHE ONLY SAFE PLACE IN TOWN
