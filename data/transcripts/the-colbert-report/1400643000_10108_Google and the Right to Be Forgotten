>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
FOLKS, IF YOU'RE JUST JOININGTHE SHOW, BACK IN THE A BLOCK, I
WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNET.I LOVE IT.
(LAUGHTER)NEVER IN HUMAN HISTORY HAVE WE
HAD ACCESS TO SUCH A VASTCOMPENDIUM OF KNOWLEDGE TO
IGNORE WHILE WE CRITICIZE PHOTOSOF BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN.
NICE CAT EARS, YA DOUCHE-BAT.
BUT THE INTERNET ALSO HAS A DARKSIDE.
IT REMEMBERS EVERY SHAMEFULTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE AND THAT
HAS HURT A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE,ALSO ANTHONY WEINER.
EVEN I AM NOT IMMUNE.
I RECENTLY GOOGLED MYSELF ANDFOUND SOME VERY DISTURBING OLD
PHOTOS.
I MEAN, WHAT IF MY CHILDRENSTUMBLE ACROSS THAT AND FIND OUT
I USED TO BE A CHILD!
MY CHILDREN WOULD LOSE ALLRESPECT FOR ME!
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME CLEAN MY ROOM,YOU'RE JUST SOME OLD KID!
(LAUGHTER)LUCKILY, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS
PIONEERED THE ANSWER.
>> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEFORGOTTEN.
THAT'S WHAT THE E.U. COURT TOLDGOOGLE.
>> EUROPEAN COURTS NOW REQUIRINGGOOGLE TO REMOVE CERTAIN
SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM THEWEB ABOUT CUSTOMERS.
>> INDIVIDUALS CAN ASK THESEARCH GIANT TO REMOVE LINKS TO
NEWS ARTICLES AND COURTJUDGMENTS AMONG OTHER THINGS.
IT'S BEEN DUBBED THE RIGHT TO BEFORGOTTEN.
>> Stephen: YES, THE RIGHT TOBE FORGOTTEN, FIRST PROPOSED
BY -- OH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
ANYWAY, I WANT TO CONGRATULATEEUROPE FOR TAKING THIS BOLD
STEP.
IT'S NO WONDER THEY DID.
I DID A LITTLE GOOGLING THISAFTERNOON.
I COULD SEE WHY EUROPEWOULD WANT TO HIDE THEIR PAST.
I MEAN, THE INQUISITION AND THEBAND THAT DID BARBIE GIRL?
THE HAGUE HAS GOT THEIR HANDSFULL.
NOW ANYONE IN EUROPE CAN ASKGOOGLE TO REMOVE LINKS AND BE
ABLE TO GET A CLEAN SLATE --POLITICIANS, YOUR BABY SITTER,
THAT NICE YOUNG MAN WHO HAS TOGO DOOR TO DOOR TELLING
NEIGHBORS THERE'S SOMETHINGABOUT HIM HE HAD
ERASED FROM THE INTERNET.
NOW THE E.U. COURT ISN'T SAYINGWE SHOULD ERASE ALL RECORDS OF
THE PAST. THEY'RE JUST SAYINGYOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
GOOGLE IT, BECAUSE WITHOUTA SEARCH ENGINE, INCRIMINATING
INFORMATION COULD NOT HAVE BEENINTERCONNECTED OR COULD HAVE
BEEN BUT ONLY WITH GREATDIFFICULTY.
YES, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT HARDERTO FIND INFORMATION ON THE
INTERNET.
AND YAHOO ANSWERS CAN ONLY DO SOMUCH.
IF ONLY THERE WERE A WAY TOSTORE KNOWLEDGE IN A PLACE
WHERE IT EXISTS BUT NO ONE WILLSEE OR HEAR OF IT.
PERHAPS WE COULD PRINT ITOCCASIONALLY THEN BIND IT AND
HOUSE IT IN A BUILDING YOU NEEDA SPECIAL CARD TO ACCESS.
YEAH!
YEAH!
NOW, THAT'S THE FUTURE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
