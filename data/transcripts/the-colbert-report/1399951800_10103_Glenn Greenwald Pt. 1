(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHTWON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR HIS
REPORTING ON THE NSA BUTIT'S OUR DATA THEY STOLE.
WHERE IS OUR PULITZER.
PLEASE WELCOME GLENNGREENWALD.
(APPLAUSE)I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.
>> GOOD, GOOD.
>> Stephen: I GOT MY KNIVESOUT FOR YOU, MY MAN.
>> READY.
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THELION'S DEN.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S EXPLAIN TOPEOPLE WHO LOVE AMERICA WHO
YOU ARE.
AUTHOR OF THREE BEST SELLINGBOOKS, YOU'VE WRITTEN FORTH
"NEW YORK TIMES", L.A. TIMESAND THE GUARDIAN WHERE YOU
ARE REPORTING ON THE NSASCANDAL AND THE ED SNOWDEN
LEAK.
JUST WON THE PULITZER PRIZEFOR PUBLIC SERVICE.
(APPLAUSE)AND A POLK AWARD FOR
NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTING.
YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED NOPLACE TO HIDE, EDWARD
SNOWDEN, THE NSA ANDTHE U.S. SURVEILLANCE STATE,
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A PLACETO HIDE?
>> I'M NOT
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> BUT IF I WERE, THEREWOULD BE NO ONE IN THIS
SURVEILLANCE STATE, THETITLE ACTUALLY COMES FROM
FRANK CHURCH WHOINVESTIGATED THE
SURVEILLANCE STATE IN THEMID 70s AND FOUND SOMETHING
NOBODY KNEW WHICH IS THATTHE NSA WAS COLLECTING
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OFCOMMUNICATIONS.
AND WHAT HE SAID WAS THIS ISAN EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS
MACHINE THAT HAS BEENBUILDING, IF IT EVER TURNED
AROUND AND AIMED AT THEAMERICAN PEOPLE THERE WOULD
BE NO PLACE TO HIDE.
A VERY MAINSTREAM DEMOCRATICSENATOR WHO SERVED IN WORLD
WAR 2 AND TO THAT'S THETITLE OF THE BOOK BECAUSE
THAT IS IN FACT WHATHAPPENED IS THE NSA HAS
TURNED THIS APPARATUS ONAMERICANS AS WELL AS THE
REST OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: BUT WE DID NOTKNOW THE EXTENT OF THAT
UNTIL EDWARD SNOWDEN LEAKED.
AND YOU PUBLISHED IT, RIGHT?
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SO UNTILYOU TOLD ME THERE WAS
NOTHING FOR ME TO BEBOTHERED ABOUT.
>> IT IS TRUE.
>> Stephen: AREN'T YOU KINDOF THE PROBLEM.
>> I AM, I DO PLEAD GUILTY.
OF COURSE, IGNORANCE ISBLISS.
>> Stephen: YES!
>> AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SOHAPPY, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YES, EXACTLY.
>> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BEAMINGWITH JOY.
>> Stephen: I WILL FORGETEVERYTHING YOU SAID TO ME AS
SOON AS YOU LEAVE THE STUDIO.
>> BUT THERE IS A REASON WHYJOURNALISM IS PROTECTIVE OF
THE FIRST AMENDMENT, AND ITIS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE A
FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY IFPEOPLE IN POWER CAN HIDE
FROM THOSE OVER WHOM THEYARE RULING THE MOST
CONSEQUENTIAL ACTS THEY AREDOING AND THE POINT OF
JOURNALISM IS TO SHINE ALIGHT ON THAT WHICH THEY ARE
TRYING TO HIDE AND THAT ISWHAT WE DID.
>> Stephen: WELL, LET'S TALKABOUT THAT WHICH THEY DID
USING YOUR FANCY WORDS.
OKAY, ED SNOWDEN, ED SNOWDENHAS REVEALED NATIONAL
SECURITY SECRETS, HAS FLEDTHE COUNTRY, A TRAITER TO
THE UNITED STATES.
WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BEPROSECUTED FOR AIDING AND
ABETTING AN ENEMY OF THEUNITED STATES.
>> THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THATHAS BEEN MADE EVERY SINGLE
TIME SOMEBODY COMES FORWARDIN AN ACT OF CONSCIENCE LIKE
ELLSBERG DID IN '71 THAT THEAMERICAN GOVERNMENT WAS
LYING TO THE POPULATIONABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR AND
EVERYONE SAID OR A LOT OFPEOPLE SAID HE IS A TRAITER,.
>> Stephen: HE LOST THEVIETNAM WAR FOR US.
>> HE REVEALED THAT THEAMERICAN GOVERNMENT KNEW
THAT IT WAS UNWINNABLE ATTHE SAME TIME THAT THEY WERE
TELLING THE POPULATION THATTHEY WERE WINNING IT.
>> Stephen: WE'LL NEVER KNOWNOW.
>> SO THAT'S THE PLAY BOOK.
>> Stephen: WE'LL NEVERKNOW.
WE MIGHT HAVE WON IF HEHADN'T SAID THAT.
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.
>> Stephen: IT UNDERMINESTHE CONFIDENCE OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THEIR OWNGOVERNMENT, IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT?
>> WHEN THEY ARE DOINGTHINGS THAT DESERVE TO HAVE
CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ACTIONSUNDERMINED, YEAH IT IS A
GOOD IDEA FOR THAT TO BEREVEALED.
>> Stephen: NOW THIS SNOWDENFELLOW, OKAY.
HE FLED TO RUSSIA.
DOES HE FEEL MORECOMFORTABLE THERE?
BECAUSE IT'S A REGIME THATIS TOTALLY OPEN AND FREE?
(LAUGHTER)WAS MORDOR NOT ACCEPTING
ASYLUM REQUESTS.
>> HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY FLEETO RUSSIA.
>> Stephen: HE FLED AND HE'SIN RUSSIA.
CHECKMATE.
DOW WANT TO SPIN THIS ONE.
SPIN IT-- SPIN IT.
>> HE WAS ON HIS WAY TOLATIN AMERICA, HEADING
THROUGH MOSCOW WHEN THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT REVOKED HISPASSPORT.
>> Stephen: IT IS EASY,PEOPLE GET LOST THAT WAY ALL
THE TIME.
>> YOU JUST SKIP RIGHT OVER.
>> Stephen: THE POINT ISUSING ASYLUM IS NOT TO
DECLARE WHAT COUNTRY YOULOVE THE MOST, IT'S TO GET
PROTECTION FROM YOUR OWNGOVERNMENT WHEN THEY ARE
TRYING TO PERSECUTE YOU SUCHAS PUTTING YOU IN PRISON FOR
40 YEARS FOR COMING FORWARDWITH INFORMATION THAT HIS
FELLOW CITIZENS OUGHT TOHAVE KNOWN.
>> Stephen: HIS FELLOWCITIZENS NEEDED TO KNOW THIS,
THAT IS THE ARGUMENT.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU FORYOUR SUPPORT.
HOW ABOUT THESE THINGS DIDHIS FELLOW CITIZENS NEED TO
KNOW WE WERE ALSO SPYING ON THERUSSIAN AND CHINESE ARMY OR
MEXICO OR THE AL QAEDA LINKISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ OR THE
AFGHAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGNAFFAIRS OR HASAN BULE WIFE
WHO IS AN ASSOCIATE OF OSAMABIN LADEN, ALL THOSE THINGS
WERE REVEALED AS WELL.
HOW IS THAT NOT GIVEN AWAYAMERICAN STATE SECRETS OR
DO YOU BELIEVE THERE SHOULDNO ESPIONAGE?
>> NO THERE SHOULD BE ESPIONAGE
HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T REVEALANY OF THAT.
WHAT HE DID WAS HE CAME TONEWSPAPERS AND SAID I WANT
YOU TO VET THIS INFORMATIONAND DISCLOSE WHAT IT IS, THE
PUBLIC OUGHT TO KNOW ANDWITHHOLD THAT WHICH THEY
SHOULD'NT.
MOST OF THOSE-- MOST OFTHOSE STORIES THAT YOU JUST
REFERENCED WERE PUBLISHED BYTHE NEWSPAPER CALLED "THE
NEW YORK TIMES" FOR WHICH HEACTUALLY GAVE NO DOCUMENTS.
>> Stephen: DON'T USE "THENEW YORK TIMES" IN DEFENSE
OF ME.
YOU BELIEVE-- YOU BELIEVETHEY DID THE RIGHT THING BY
PUBLISHING THAT.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: YOU DO.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: YOU BELIEVE THEUNITED STATES'S SECRETS OF
OUR INTELLIGENCE APPARATUSSHOULD BE REVEALED.
>> THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OFAMERICAN CITIZENS MATTER A
GREAT DEAL.
>> Stephen: THESE AREN'TAMERICAN CITIZENS.
>> THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OFNONAMERICANS, THE PRIVACY
RIGHTS OF-- .
>> Stephen: ITS PRIVACYRIGHTS OF NONAMERICANS DON'T
HAVE PRIVACY RIGHTS.
>> THEY DO, DO, THEY DO.
>> Stephen: NO, THEY DON'T.
IF THEY WANT PRIVACY RIGHTSTHEY SHOULD BECOME AMERICAN
CITIZENS AND GIVE THEM UP.
>> THAT IS ONE THEORY.
THE OTHER THEORY IS THAT THEINTERNET IS THIS GLOBAL
MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND IFTHE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
IS INVADING IT, TURNING ITINTO THIS MASS UBIQIOUTIOUS
SYSTEM OF SURVEILLANCE WHICHTHEY ARE
DOING YOU REALLY CAN'TSEGREGATE WHAT THEY ARE
DOING TO AMERICANS VERSUSNONAMERICANS IT MAKES THE
INTERNET WEAKENED IT MAKESIT SO THAT ALL
COMMUNICATIONS THAT TAKEPLACE ELECTRONICALLY OVER
THE INTERNET ARE KNOWN TOTHE NSA, COLLECTED, MONITORED
AND STORED AND THAT IS WHATSNOWDEN THINKS WE SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT AND IFIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
ANYONE WOULD SAY WE WOULDREMAIN BETTER OFF TO REMAIN
IGNORANT OF WHAT OUR OWNGOVERNMENT IS DOING TO THE
INTERNET.
>> Stephen: THESE ARE NOTALL INTERNET.
>> THEY ARE TELEPHONE,INTERNET.
>> Stephen: TELEPHONE ISN'TINTERNET.
>> GOOD POINT.
>> Stephen: DID I JUST WINTHE ARGUMENT.
>> YOU WON THAT PART OF THEARGUMENT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERYMUCH.
>> CON GATTLATIONS.
>> Stephen: WHERE IS MYPULITZER?
(LAUGHTER)HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
WE'VE GOT TO GO TO ACOMMERCIAL BREAK.
BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITHMORE GLENN GREENWALD.
