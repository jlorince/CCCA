iPHONE BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE
IT.
>> EVERYTHING IS LIVE ON
"POLITICO", WE DON'T WAIT
AROUND.
WE DON'T WAIT UNTIL WE GET
IN THE GREEN ROOM SO IF YOU
MAKE NEWS HERE LIKE YOU DID
EARLIER IT IS ALREADY
TWEETED.
WE ALREADY HAVE A STORY UP.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A STORY
UP ALREADY OF THE HISTORIC
NEWS I MADE EARLIER TONIGHT.
>> "POLITICO" IS SO FAST WE
ALREADY HAVE, WE HAVE
ANALYSIS OF YOUR PROSPECTS
IN SOUTH CAROLINA SHOULD YOU
CHOOSE TO MAKE AN EVEN MORE
HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT.
SO-- .
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE THE
PROSPECTS FOR ME IN MY SOUTH
CAROLINA-- STILL IN
EXPLORATORY STAGE.
>> SHOULD YOU PROCEED YOU
WILL BE STRONG ON THE COAST,
YOU WILL BE GOOD IN COLLEGE
TOWNS, CLEMSON, COLUMBIA,
CHARLESTON.
>> Stephen: COME ON, I LOVE
MY TIGERS AND MY GAME COCKS,
ALL RIGHT.
>> AND YOU ARE GOING
TO-- BUT I HAVE BAD NEWS,
YOU HAVE A CEILING.
YOUR SEALING ACORDING TO
"POLITICO" IS 5% BUT-- .
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY SEALING IS 5%.
I'M STARTING AT 5%.
MY FLOOR AND MY CEILING ARE
AT 5%.
>> YOU HAVE ANOTHER PERCENT,
IT IS GOING BE A BIG FACTOR.
>> Stephen: I GOT TO LOSE
SOME WEIGHT.
>> BIG FACTOR IS THE WINNER
BREAKS, HOW FAST IS STEPHEN
WILL GET BACK TO, ODD FOR
YOU-- .
>> Stephen: LET ME TAKE THE
HAMMER TO YOU FOR A SECOND,
OKAY.
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
WASHINGTON INSIDERS, AREN'T
YOU.
>> I'M FROM CALIFORNIA.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE WERE
FROM CALIFORNIA.
NOW ARE YOU SOMEBODY WHO IS
SO INVESTED IN THE
MACHINATIONS OF WASHINGTON,
D.C. I SEE THAT THIS YEAR
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THAT.
>> THERE'S THE THING.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE WANT TO
HEAR THE REAL STORY.
>> HAMMER, HAMMER.
>> Stephen: THE PEOPLE-- WANT
TO HEAR THE STORIES FROM
LITTLE TOWNS LIKE DAVIS
STATION OR 96 OR CLEMSON OR
COLUMBIA OR CHARLESTON OR
MURRELLS INLET OR MONKS
CORNER OR SOMERVILLE OR
AIKEN.
THESE ARE THE REAL STORIES,
OR HELL HOLE SWAMPS, THOSE
ARE THE REAL STORIES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, AND DO YOU
NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING
ON IN THE REAL MARK WHICH
CONTRASTS WITH THIS STUDIO.
>> Stephen: OH THIS IS THE
REAL AMERICA, ISN'T IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU PEOPLE AT
"POLITICO" AND "POLITICO"
PLAY BOOK HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWING THE CANDIDATES
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THESE
CANDIDATES THAT YOU HAVE
SEEN FROM THE AMOUNT OF TIME
YOU SPENT WITH EACH ONE,
LIKE GINGRICH, WHAT DON'T HE
KNOW ABOUT GINGRICH.
>> HE'S VERY HUMBLE.
WE DID WE'RE DOING A SERIES
OF eBOOKS ABOUT THE
CAMPAIGN.
THE FIRST ONE, THE RIGHT
FIGHTS BACK IS OUT, 299, A
GREAT BUY FROM RANDOM HOUSE
AND WE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH
NEWT GINGRICH TWO WEEKS
LATER IT WAS IN THE eBOOK,
HE SAYS WATCH THIS CAMPAIGN.
HE SAID IT WILL BE LIKE
WATCHING RAY KRAFT BUILD
McDONALD'S OR SAM WALTON
BUILD WAL-MART.
>> Stephen: HE SEEMS TO
ENJOY FRENCH FRIES AND AS
FAR AS WAL-MART, I ASSUME
THAT MEANS HE IS NOT
OFFERING ANYONE HEALTH
INSURANCE.
OKAY WHAT ABOUT ROMNEY, WHAT
ABOUT ROMNEY.
WE KNOW, WE KNOW WHAT THESE
PEOPLE LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY
SAY, WHAT DO THEY SMELL
LIKE.
I IMAGINE ROMNEY SMELLS LIKE
SORT OF AN ANTISEPTIC PEPPER
MINT.
WHAT IS HE REALLY LIKE IN
PERSON.
>> HE MAY SEEM LIKE A PEPPER
MINT, BUT BEHIND THE SCENES
CAN BE TOUGH.
WE'RE TOLD BY PEOPLE WHO
HAVE RUN AFOUL OF HIM WHEN
YOU GET IN TROUBLE WITH HIM
THAT IS A MITT-FRONTATION.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> AND YOU DON'T WANT A MITT
FRONTATION.
>> Stephen: I REALLY DON'T
LIKE THE SOUND OF IT.
SO HE'S NOT PEPPER MINT,
HE'S MORE OF LIKE A COUNTRY
NUGGET.
>> SOMETIMES HE NEEDS A
PEPPER MINT TOO.
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT
HE LOOKS CLEAN CUT.
>> Stephen: HE DOES LOOK
LIKE CURRENT CUT.
ARE YOU SAYING HE HAS SOME
SORT OF-- REALLY, HE'S A
DIRTY WHORE.
WHAT ARE HIS VICES.
>> WHEN HE'S OFF CAMERA HE
EATS PIZZA.
>> Stephen: HE EATS PIZZA.
ARE MORMONS NOT ALLOWED TO
EAT PIZZA.
I THINK THAT IS REALLY A
HARD SELLING POINT FOR A
RELIGION.
>> HIS OTHER VICE, KFC, EATS
FRIED CHICKEN BUT PULLS THE
SKIN OFF.
>> Stephen: THAT GUY SOUNDS
FUN.
MIKE ALLEN THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.

THE RIGHT-- WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
THANK YOU, MIKE.
