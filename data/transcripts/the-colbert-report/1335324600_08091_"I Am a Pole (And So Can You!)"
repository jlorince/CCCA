[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
SO KIND.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.
NATION, WE WILL HAVE MORE NEWS ON DELAWARE IN, LIKE, FOUR YEARS I'M GUESSING.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOR NOW, FOLKS, BACK IN JANUARY, I SAT DOWN WITH LEGENDARY AUTHOR OF "WHERE THE
WILD THINGS ARE" MAURICE SENDAK TO GET SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO
BREAK INTO THE CHILDREN'S BOOK RACKET.
>> EVERY CELEBRITY IS OUT THERE CASHING IN ON CHILDREN'S BOOKS,
AND I WANT IN.
WHAT'S IT TAKE FOR A CELEBRITY TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL BOOK?
WHAT DO I GOT TO DO?
>> YOU STARTED ALREADY BY BEING AN IDIOT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THE MAN KNOWS TALENT.
SO I READ MAURICE MY STORY, "I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU" TO GET HIS REACTION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> THE SAD THING IS I LIKE IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WELL, MAURICE, IF LYING IT MADE YOU SAD, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE CLINICALLY DEPRESSED THAT "I AM A POLE AND SO CAN
YOU" IS BEING PUBLISHED ON MAY 8th.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND CHECK OUT THE BLURB.
"THE SAD THING IS I LIKE IT," MAURICE SENDAK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS... THANK YOU.
LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S GOT PICTURES AND EVERYTHING.
"I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU" IS THE INSPIRATIONAL STORY OF A
POLE TRYING TO FIND HIS PLACE IN THE WORLD.
IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT TO GIVE A CHILD OR GRANDCHILD FOR THEIR HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE GRADUATION.
[LAUGHTER]
ALSO FATHER'S DAY.
ALSO OTHER TIMES.
AND, FOLKS, IT'S AVAILABLE AS AN AUDIO BOOK, READ BY NONE OTHER THAN TOM HANKS.
SIX WHOLE MINUTES OF UNCULT HANKS, AND TOM'S ALREADY STARTED TO LOSE WEIGHT TO PLAY THE POLE
IN THE MOVIE TRILOGY.
AND ALL OF MY AND TOM'S MONEY FROM THIS AUDIO BOOK WILL GO TO U.S. VETS, THE UNITED STATES
VETERANS INITIATIVE, WHICH HELPS VETERANS TRANSITION BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE.
NOW, OF COURSE...
