[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU
EVERYBODY, WE WILL COME BACK,
FOLKS.
I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY
THAT ON FRIDAY JULY FIRST AT
8:00 PM, YOU CAN SEE ME LIVE AT
THE GAILLARD MUNICIPAL
AUDITORIUM IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH
CAROLINA ,TO BENEFIT THE MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA'S
JAMES W. COLBERT ENDOWED CHAIR.
THEY PROVIDE THE CHAIR; I
PROVIDE THE ENDOWED.
[LAUGHTER]
I'LL BE INTERVIEWED BY MSNBC'S
JONATHAN ALTER AND TAKING YOUR
QUESTIONS.
AND I'LL BE SPEWING SUCH JUICY
SECRETS, THE FIRST THREE ROWS
WILL BE PROVIDED PONCHOS.
SEE YOU THERE.
FOLKS, I LOVE MY HOME TOWN
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SMALL TOWN
AMERICA IS THE REAL AMERICA.
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN STILL FIND
GOOD MORALS, A STRONG WORK
ETHIC, AND PRIMO METH.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, THE HIGH SPEED CHICKEN
FEED.
SO IT'S TIME FOR MY LATEST
HOMETOWN HEROTOWN.
THIS WEEK'S HOMETOWN HERO-TOWN
LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY!
WHERE FOLKS KNOW THAT THERE ARE
SOME THINGS IN LIFE WORTH
STANDING UP FOR.
THEY'D JUST RATHER SIT DOWN FOR
THEM.
JIM?
>> SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO THIS
ONE, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY, IS THE
MOST SEDENTARY CITY IN THE U.S.
A STUDY BY "MEN'S HEALTH"
MAGAZINE FOUND IT'S THE MOST
INACTIVE PLACE IN THE U.S.
INDIANAPOLIS AND JACKSON ROUND
OUT THE TOP THREE.
>> Stephen: SORRY, INDIANAPOLIS
AND JACKSON.
IF YOU WANT TO BEAT LEXINGTON,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAKE UP
PRETTY LATE IN THE MORNING.
[LAUGHTER]
THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY
"MEN'S HEALTH" MAGAZINE.
MY GO-TO SOURCE FOR VAGUELY
HOMOEROTIC FITNESS PHOTOGRAPHY
AND THE HOTTEST PROTEIN POWDER
RECOMMENDATIONS MONTHS BEFORE
THEY'RE RECALLED.
[LAUGHTER]
LEXINGTON BEAT OUT 100 OTHER
AMERICAN CITIES BASED ON DATA
REGARDING HOW MUCH THEY
EXERCISE, HOW MANY HOURS OF TV
THEY WATCH A WEEK, AND HOW MANY
VIDEO GAMES A YEAR THEY BUY.
SOME OF THE POPULAR VIDEO GAME
TITLES INCLUDED:
"WII HAMMOCK" AND "CALL OF DUTY:
LET IT GO TO VOICEMAIL."
[LAUGHTER]
SO LEXINGTON, IN RECOGNITION OF
YOUR NON-ACHIEVEMENT, I AM
PRESENTING YOU WITH THIS YEAR'S
GOLDEN REACHER-GRABBER.
PUT IN ON YOUR MANTLE PROUDLY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING --
THAT MANTLE YOU WANT TO PUT IT
ON IS HIGH AND UNREASONABLY FAR
FROM THE COUCH WHICH IS WHY THE
GOLDEN REACHER GRABBER COMES
WITH A SECOND REACHER GRABBER.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU PICK THAT UP THERE.
THERE YOU GO.
SO CONGRATULATIONS LEXINGTON,
KENTUCKY.
BE SURE TO SHOW THIS AWARD TO
SOME FRIENDS YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN
A WHILE.
YOUR FEET.
