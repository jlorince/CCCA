>> MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT 43YEARS IN THE NAVY.
THAT'S EVEN LONGER THAN THAT GUYFROM THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.
PLEASE WELCOME ADMIRAL MIKEMULLEN.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HONOR TO HAVE YOU SIR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
YOU'RE RETIRED A U.S. NAVYADMIRAL.
YOU SERVED AS THE 17THCHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF.
THAT'S A BIG JOB.
AS CHAIRMAN.
YOU WERE THE HIGHEST RANKINGOFFICER IN THE U.S. ARMED
FORCES.
IN 2011 YOU RETIRED AFTER 43YEARS OF SERVICE.
SIR, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERETONIGHT.
THE WORLD'S ON FIRE.
ALL RIGHT.
>> CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: WORLD'S ON FIRE.
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF HOT SPOTSOUT INTEREST.
WHAT ARE THE PLACE WHERE'S THEFIRE'S CATCHING FIRE OUT THERE?
>> I THINK SYRIA IS PROBABLY THECENTER OF GRAVITY RIGHT NOW.
>> STEPHEN: YOU'VE GOT SYRIA.
YOU'VE GOT IRAQ.
ALSO AFGHANISTAN.
STILL GOT SOME TROUBLE.
PAKISTAN IS VERY TROUBLING TOUS.
YOU HAVE SOMALIA, YOU HAVEYEMEN.
HAS THE WORLD EVER BEEN MOREDANGEROUS THAN THIS?
>> CERTAINLY NOT IN MY LIFETIMETHAT I'M AWARE OF.
>> STEPHEN: THAT INCLUDES THESOVIET UNION.
>> THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE.
ALTHOUGH, I THINK THE BIGDIFFERENCE IS IN THOSE DAYS
ACTUALLY THE SINGLE EXISTENTIALTHREAT THAT EXISTED WAS THE
SOVIET UNION.
AND THERE ISN'T AN EXISTENTIALTHREAT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IN
ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES WITH THELEVEL OF TERRORISM, BUT IT IS
SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TOGROW, AND IT CONTINUES TO BURN
OUT OF CONTROL, IF YOU WILL, INWAYS THAT ARE VERY
UNPREDICTABLE.
SO PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLEEAST.
IT IS A HUGE, HUGE CONCERN.
>> STEPHEN: NOW, OBVIOUSLY, IASSUME YOU'RE ON BOARD WITH BILL
O'REILLY'S 25,000-MAN MERCENARYARMY.
( LAUGHTER )DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH
THAT, 25,000 PEOPLE FROM AROUNDTHE WORLD WHO GET TAUGHT ENGLISH
AND ARE PAID VERY WELL, OR THEU.S. ARMED FORCES?
WHICH WOULD YOU PICK?
( LAUGHTER )AND PLEASE DON'T LET YOUR YEARS
AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTCHIEFS INFLUENCE YOU IN THIS
DECISION.
( LAUGHTER )THINK OBJECTIVELY ABOUT THIS FOR
A SECOND MERCENARY ARMY-U.S.
ARMED FORCES.
YOU HAD TO PICK, WHICH WOULD ITBE?
>> IT WOULD BE IS THIS ONE.
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT.
>> U.S. ARMED FORCES.
>> STEPHEN:  I ASSUME YOU WERERANKED JUST BELOW BILL O'REILLY
IN OUR MILITARY.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT, ALLRIGHT.
WELL, BILL'S NOT GOING TO LIKETHAT, AND THE MAN HAS A
MERCENARY ARMY.
I WOULDN'T CROSS HIM.
>> I KNOW, I KNOW( LAUGHTER ).
>> STEPHEN: SO WE'RE IN SYRIANOW.
AND WE'RE-- WE OFFICIALLY DON'THAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND, BUT WE
HAVE ADVISERS ON THE GROUND?
>> ACTUALLY, NOT IN SYRIA.
WE HAVE ADVISERS ON THE GROUNDIN IRAQ, ABOUT 1600 OF THEM.
>> STEPHEN: HOW MUCH OF ADIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN
WESTERN IRAQ AND SYRIA AT THISPOINT?
IS THERE A BORDER?
>> I THINK IT'S JUST ACTUALLY INNAME ONLY.
I MEAN, THAT PART OF THE DESERTIS WIDE OPEN, AND AS FAR AS ISIL
RIGHT NOW, THEY CONTROL AN AWFULLOT OF TERRITORY, BOTH IN IRAQ
AND SYRIA.
THEY CALL IT THE BEGINNING OFTHE CALIPHATE, IF YOU WILL.
AND THEIR STATE THAT THEY'VEESTABLISHED -- WHICH I DON'T
THINK HAS ANY SUBSTANTIALUNDERPINNING IN TERMS OF REALITY
IN INTERNATIONAL OR ANYTHINGLIKE, THAT BUT IT'S WHAT THEY
CLAIM.
>> STEPHEN: THEY USED TO BETHE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ AND
SYRIA.
NOW THEY'RE JUST THE ISLAMICSTATE.
>> CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: THEY'RE LIKE CHER.
THEY JUST DROPPED THE END.
( LAUGHTER )THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT FANS OF
CHER.
HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO BEDOING THIS?
IT LOOKED LIKE WE MIGHT HAVEBEEN GETTING OUT OF THAT PART OF
THE WORLD FOR A WHILE.
IN 2011, RIGHT AROUND THE TIMETHAT YOU LEFT AS CHAIRMAN OF THE
JOINT CHIEFS, WE OFFICIALLY HADENDED ALL MILITARY OCCUPATION IN
IRAQ.
NOW WE'RE BACK IN.
WAS US LEAVING A HICCUP OR ISTHIS THE HICCUP?
WHICH IS THE NORMAL STATE FORUS?
>> WELL, MY-- MY VIEW OF THAT ISIN 2011 WHEN EGYPT STARTED TO
UNFOLD AND THE REVOLUTION THERE,I SAID THEN AND I STILL THINK IN
THAT PART OF THE WORLD, WE'RE INA 30- TO 40-YEAR RUN.
>> STEPHEN: 30 TO 40 YEARS.
>>>> --CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: SO LIKE THE COLDWAR.
>> IN TERMS OF THE REVOLUTIONAND THE CHANGE AND THE
UNCERTAINTY AND THE INSTABILITY.
AND I THINK IT'S JUST CASCADEDFROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
>> STEPHEN: 30 TO 40 YEARS OFINSTABILITY THERE OR 30 TO 40
YEARS OF US OVER THERE?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TOTHAT.
I THINK WE ARE -->> STEPHEN:  IF YOU COULD JUST
GUESS.
>> I COULD GUESS.
MY-- MY INSTINCTS ARE WE'REGOING TO BE-- WE NEED TO BE
ENGAGED IN THAT PART OF THEWORLD FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO
ENSURE THAT IT CAN BE STABLE ANDNOT CONTINUE TO GROW IN A WAY
THAT THREATENS AN AWFUL LOT OFPEOPLE, INCLUDING AMERICAN
CITIZENS.
>> STEPHEN: NOW THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION IS USING RIGHT
NOW OUR TROOPS NOT JUST FORMILITARY MISSIONS BUT FOR
HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS IN AFRICAFIGHTING EBOLA.
>> RIGHT.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: WE DON'T HAVEBOOTS ON THE GROUND.
WE HAVE MEDICAL BOOTIES ON THEGROUND, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU THINKTHAT'S HOW WE SHOULD BE USING
OUR TROOPS?
SHOULD THEYING PASSING OUT SWABSAND SYRINGES IN AFRICA?
>> I BELIEVE STRONGLY THOSEKINDS OF MISSIONS OFTEN TIME
HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT ON WHO THEUNITED STATES IS AND WHAT WE
STAND FOR THAN THE MILITARYMISSIONS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I'VE SEEN IT-- I'VE-- I'VE SEENTHIS IN INDONESIA, AFTER THE
EARTHQUAKE IN '04.
CERTAINLY THE RESPONSE WE HAD ATTHE TERRIBLE TRAGEDY OF THE
EARTHQUAKE OFF HAITI WHERE WEPROVIDED TROOPS, AND WE CAN
ORGANIZE.
WE CAN COMMUNICATE.
WE DO-- WE LOGISTICALLY CAN MOVEAN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF VERY
QUICKLY.
SO WE'RE MORE THAN CAPABLE OFHANDLING A MISSION LIKE THAT
UNTIL THE REST OF THE WORLD ANDOTHER CAPABILITIES CAN BE
BROUGHT IN.
BUT RIGHT NOW, MOVING AS FAST ASWE HAVE, I THINK THAT EBOLA
MISSION IS A-- IS A VERYIMPORTANT MISSION FOR US.
>> STEPHEN: THE PRESIDENT DIDSAY ONE THING THE OTHER DAY THAT
I LIKED.
HE SAID THAT WHEN SOMETHING GOESWRONG IN THE WORLD, WHEN THERE'S
A MUDSLIDE IN GUATEMALANOBODYSAYS, "GET ME THE RUSSIANS."
THEY CALL US AND WE GO IN THEREAND HELP CLEAN THINGS UP.
DO YOU THINK AMERICA'SREPUTATION IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE
OF THE MILITARY ENGAGEMENT WE'VEHAD OVER THE LAST 13 YEARS IS
DAMAGED?
>> I DO.
I DO.
I THINK IN FACT-- I DON'T KNOWHOW MANY PEOPLE I COULD ASK THAT
WOULD GET THE CORRECT ANSWER TOTHIS QUESTION WHICH IS HAVING
BOMBED SYRIA, HOW MANY MUSLIMCOUNTRIES HAVE WE BOMBED?
AND THIS IS OUR SEVENTH.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH, YEAH, ONEMORE AND WE GET A FREE FALAFAL.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> AND IT'S TOUGH TO MAKEFRIENDS WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT.
>> STEPHEN:  YEAH, THE BOMBSTEND TO BE A CONVERSATION
STOPPER.
>> IT DOES.
( LAUGHTER )THAT SAID, I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO
TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESSPARTICULARLY THIS THREAT THAT'S
NOW RISING IN SYRIA AND IRAQ.
>> STEPHEN: AGAIN, MERCENARYARMY.
( LAUGHTER )THE BEST OF THE BEST.
THE BEST OF THE BEST.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> STEPHEN: YOU WOULD NOTBELIEVE THE NUMBER OF MILITARY
PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING BILL ANDSAYING IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
>> REALLY?
>> STEPHEN: WOULD YOU BELIEVEIT?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: NEITHER WOULD I.
ALL RIGHT.
( APPLAUSE )HERE'S ONE THING.
LET'S TALK ABOUT MILITARY--LET'S TALK ABOUT A REAL
SUCCESSFUL MILITARY MISSION THATEVERYBODY SHOULD FEEL GREAT
ABOUT AND THAT'S WHEN WE WENTAND GOT BIN LADEN.
YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WHEN THATTHING WAS GOING DOWN.
AND YOU HAD TO BE THE ONE TOCALL THE HEAD OF THE PAKISTANI
MILITARY.
>> CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: TO SAY THAT WE GOTHIM.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: HOW WAS THAT?
( LAUGHTER )DID YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE
PHONE?
OR WAS IT-- YOU KNOW, "I'LL DOIT!
I'LL DO IT!
LET ME!">> ACTUALLY, THERE WAS A DEBATE
FOR A WHILE INTERNALLY -->> STEPHEN:  BIDEN WANTED TO
DO IT.
BIDEN WANTED TO DO IT.
>> AND THEN IT FELL TO ME.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
>> IT PRINCIPALLY DID BECAUSEI'D HAD A LONG-STANDING
RELATIONSHIP WITH GENERAL KEANY,THE HEAD OF THEIR ARMY --
>> STEPHEN:  WHAT TIME IS ITOVER THERE WHEN YOU CALLED HIM?
>> TWO IN THE MORNING, THREE INTHE MORNING.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S ROLE PLAY.
HELLO, MIKE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT ISHERE, MAN?
WHAT'S UP, ARE YOU OKAY?
>> NO, ACTUALLY, HE KNEW WHATTIME IT WAS, AND HE KNEW WHY I
WAS CALLING.
>> STEPHEN: OH, REALLY?
>> WELL, HE KNEW, CLEARLY, THATSOMETHING HAD HAPPENED.
>> STEPHEN: DID YOU SAY, "HI,IT'S MIKE.
WE FOUND BIN LADEN.
GUESS WHERE?"( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )WAS HE CHAGRINED?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: WERE THEYCHAGRINED AT ALL?
>> HE WAS-- HE WAS ACTUALLYSURPRISED.
I MEAN, LITERALLY.
NOW, THIS IS IN THE HUMANDIMENSION.
THIS DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OFSENSE, BUT I KNEW HIM PRETTY
WELL, AND HIS REACTION WASSURPRISE, ONE, THAT WE'D FOUND
HIM.
AND, TWO, THAT HE WAS WHERE WEFOUND HIM, WHICH WAS ABOUT A
MILE FROM THEIR-- THEIR VERSIONOF WEST POINT, WHICH IS A PRETTY
HIGH-END AREA, HIGH-ENDNEIGHBORHOOD.
AND ACTUALLY, IT WAS A DIFFICULTCONVERSATION BUT IT WAS A
FOLLOW-UP TO A CONVERSATION I'DHAD A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
THAT WHICH WAS I DON'T KNOW APRESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES
WHOEVER IT WOULD BE THAT IF THEYDIDN'T-- IF WE KNEW, NUMBER ONE,
BIN LADEN, NUMBER 2, AL-ZAWAHIRIWAS IN PAKISTAN WE WOULDN'T COME
IN AND GET THEM.
IN THAT REGARD, HE WASN'TSURPRISED.
WHAT HAPPENED REALLY WAS THEWEEK AFTER THAT, BECAUSE THEY
FELT HIS MILITARY, WHO HAS A LOTOF PRIDE, THEY FELT EMBARRASSED
BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED, BY WHATTHEY COULDN'T DO, HOW THEY
COULDN'T RESPOND, AND HE HAD THEWORST WEEK OF HIS LIFE --
>> STEPHEN:  NOT AS BAD AS BINLADEN'S.
>> NO, I KNOW.
( APPLAUSE ).
>> STEPHEN: YOU'RE IN THE-- THERE'S A FAMOUS PHOTO OF
ALL YOU GUYS WATCHING.
IT'S YOU, IT'S THE PRESIDENT,AND I THINK BILL-- BILL O'REILLY
WAS IN THAT PHOTO, I THINK.
THERE HE IS.
EXACTLY.
EXACTLY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
BILL MADE THAT CALL.
ADMIRAL, WHAT DO YOU THINK--WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW--
>> OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY, ADMIRAL,WHAT DO YOU THINK-- IF YOU LOOK
AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA,WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO
HAPPEN THERE?
DO YOU THINK THE CHINESE-- OFWHAT YOU KNOW FROM THE CHINESE
MILITARY, DO YOU THINK THECHINESE MILITARY WILL ROLL TANKS
IN TO HONG KONG?
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOINGTO ROLL TANKS, BUT I THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK VERY HARDTO STOP WHAT'S GOING ON.
I THINK-- I MEAN, THEY REALLYARE-- THEY DON'T WANT TO REPEAT
TIANANMEN, BUT XI JINPING DOESNOT WANT THIS TO CONTINUE, AND I
THINK HE WILL FIGURE OUT A WAYTO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN, THAT IT STOPS.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU THINK THEUNITED STATES CAN GET BACK TO A
WORLD WHERE IT IS NOT PUTTINGOUT FIRES IN 24 COUNTRIES AT
ONCE?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.
>> STEPHEN: IS THERE ANYONEELSE TO STEP IN WITHOUT US?
>> I THINK IT'S HARD TO DOWITHOUT US.
WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD WITH NOONE CAN DO IT ALONE ANYMORE,
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.
BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH DEPTH ANDBREADTH OF CAPABILITY, NOT JUST
MILITARY, THROUGHOUT OURCOUNTRY, AND WE HAVE AN AWFUL
LOT OF CONVENING POWER WHERE WECAN BRING OTHERS ALONG, AND I
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL.
SO BOTH IN THE POLITICAL WORLD,THE DIPLOMATIC WORLD, AS WELL AS
THE MILITARY WORLD, AND THEECONOMIC WORLD, THAT WE ARE
EXPECTED TO BE OUT THERE AND INFACT WHEN WE'RE NOT OUT THERE,
BOTH OUR FRIENDS WONDER AND THEENEMIES WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON.
THEY'RE CONFUSED BECAUSE WE'RENOT OUT THERE.
THAT MESSAGE COMES-- COMESACROSS LOUD AND CLEAR.
SO I'M SOMEONE BELIEVE THATS THEUNITED STATES IS THE
INDISPENSABLE COUNTRY AND WEWILL CONTINUE TO HAVE TO STAY
ENGAGED AND IT'S A VERY TOUGH,COMPLEX, UNSTABLE WORLD IN SOME
PARTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVETO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FACILITATE
A BETTER FUTURE IN THE END FORMANY PEOPLES IN MANY COUNTRIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU EVER GETTIRED?
DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THEMIDDLE EAST AND TRYING TO
MEMORIZE THOSE NEW NAMES.
LIKE I THOUGHT I'D BE ABLE TOCUT OUT LIKE THE MUKTADAH ALL
THOSE CONSONANTS JAMMEDTOGETHER.
DOES IT EVER WEAR YOU DOWN, ALLTHE DIFFERENT FIRES WE HAVE TO
PUT OUT IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
OUR ACTIONS OVER THERE.
DO YOU EVER WANT TO THROW UPYOUR HANDS AND GO BACK TO BED?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: NO?
>> NO.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS SORTOF AN OVER-ARCHING STRATEGY AND
PLAN FOR THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRYBY COUNTRY, AND THEN EVEN IN THE
REGIONAL SENSE PER SE, AND ITHINK HAVING THAT AND HAVING A
VIEW OF THAT WOULD THEN ALLOWEVERYBODY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY
COULD CONTRIBUTE, IF IT'SANOTHER COUNTRY, OR WE COULD
CONTRIBUTE, EVEN INSIDE OUROWN-- OUR OWN COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN: CAN I TELL YOU WHYI THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
MIGHT BE TIRED OF IT AND WANT TOGO BACK TO BED-- AND I'M
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, AND,THEREFORE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S BECAUSE--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'RE-- WE'RE ASKED TO BE AFRAID
OF IT.
YOU GET TO THINK ABOUT IT ALLTHE THE TIME OR YOU DID GET TO
THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME ANDSAY TO YOURSELF, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT LITTLE CORNER OF THE DESERTLOOKS LIKE IT COULD BLOW UP REAL
GOOD.
LET'S GO OVER THERE.
WHEREAS, WE'RE ASKED TO BEAFRAID OF IT, AND WE'RE REMINDED
TO BE AFRAID OF IT, BUT WE NOLONGER HAVE MUCH OF A VOICE IN
IT BECAUSE OUR CONGRESSIONALREPRESENTATIVES WON'T VOTE ON
WHETHER WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DOANYTHING ABOUT IT.
WE'RE NOT ASKED TO SACRIFICETHAT MUCH FOR IT.
VERY FEW OF US GO FIGHT.
AND WE'RE ALSO NOT TOLD ALL THATMUCH ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER
THERE.
SO ALL WE HAVE IS THE FEAR ANDNONE OF THE ACTION.
AND SO WE EVENTUALLY WANT TOSTOP THINKING ABOUT IT, AND
THAT'S WHY THAT 25,000-MANMERCENARY ARMY STARTS TO SOUND
GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )SO WE ALSO--
( APPLAUSE )WE ALSO WANT TO STOP CARING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR MENAND WOMEN WHO GO OVER THERE
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TOSACRIFICE FOR SOMETHING THAT WE
DON'T THINK IS RIGHT, AND YET,WE DON'T HAVE MUCH VOICE IN IT
ANYMORE.
( APPLAUSE ).
( CHEERS )>> SO YOU BRING UP A CONCERN
THAT I HAVE WITH RESPECT TO AGROWING DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE
MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN THISALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE WHO ARE THE
BEST I'VE EVER SEEN.
THEY'RE LESS THAN 1% OF THEPOPULATION.
THEY COME FROM FEWER AND FEWERPLACES IN AMERICA.
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHODIDN'T HAVE TO BUY INTO THESE
WARS, AS YOU SAID-- AND I AGREEWITH THAT-- AND CERTAINLY THE
VAST, VAST MAJORITY DIDN'T HAVETO FIGHT IN THEM, DON'T KNOW WHO
WE ARE AS A MILITARY.
AND IN FACT-- AND I'VE SAID THISMANY TIMES-- WHAT I ACTUALLY DO
WORRY ABOUT IS THAT WE BECOMESOME VERSION OF SOMETHING LIKE
THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION, WHICHIS PLEASE GO OFF AND FIGHT OUR
DIRTY LITTLE WARS AND LET US GETON WITH OUR LIVES.
AND I THINK THAT'S A DISASTERFOR AMERICA.
WE NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THEAMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO
DO THAT THROUGH THE SYSTEMTHAT'S HERE, THOSE THAT ARE
ELECTED, AND I CERTAINLY AGREETHAT THOSE WHO ARE ELECTED OUGHT
TO VOTE ON WHAT WE DO.
AND WE OUGHT TO( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND IF I CAN MAKE-- AND WE OUGHTTO HAVE A FULSOME, RAGING DEBATE
ABOUT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> STEPHEN: ADMIRAL, THANK YOUSO MUCH.
ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
