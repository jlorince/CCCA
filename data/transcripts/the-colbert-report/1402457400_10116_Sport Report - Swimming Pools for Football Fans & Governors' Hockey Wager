[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO THEWORLD OF SPORTS, EVERYBODY
ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT THE THRILL OFVICTORY AND THE AGONY OF DEFEAT,
BUT NOBODY EVER MENTIONS THE"MEH" OF A TIE.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FIRST UP, FIRST UP, NATION, ILOVE WATCHING FOOTBALL, OR
IF FOOTBALL'S NOT AVAILABLE, THE
JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS, A TEAMTHAT'S WON ONLY 11 GAMES IN THE
LAST THREE YEARS BUT HAS A BOLDNEW PLAN TO PUT BUTTS IN THE
SEATS BY TAKING OUT THE SEATS.
>> THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS'FANS WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH GAMES
THIS SEASON SITTING IN ASWIMMING POOL
WHILE THE TEAM WAS UPGRADING THESTADIUM.
THEY HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.
>> THEY ADDED TWO POOLS ALONGWITH 16 CABANAS.
>> Stephen: YES, POOLS, THEPERFECT PLACE TO KICK BACK AND
WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME, AT LEASTUNTIL THEY PUT HAMMOCKS BETWEEN
THE UPRIGHTS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING HIT BYFIELD GOALS, BECAUSE AGAIN, IT'S
THE JAGUARS.
NOW, THE CABANA PACKAGE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]A LOT OF JAGUAR FANS HERE
TONIGHT.
THE CABANA PACKAGE COSTS A MERE$12,500 PER GAME, INCLUDES 50
TICKETS AND IS ALL YOU CAN EATAND DRINK, OF COURSE, YOU WILL
HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR AFTEREATING BEFORE GETTING INTO THE
POOL, BUT ONCE YOU DO, DRINK ALLTHE BEER YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALREADY IN THE BATHROOM.
NATURALLY THIS BOLD PLAN RAISESA LOT OF QUESTIONS, LIKE WHY?
AND REALLY, WHY?
THE TEAM'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTOF SALES EXPLAINS, WE WANTED TO
TAKE AREAS IN OUR STADIUM THATWERE UNDERPERFORMING AND GET
CREATIVE.
POOLS ARE A GOOD START, BUT THEYSHOULD ALSO TACKLE THE STADIUM'S
MOST UNDERPERFORMING AREA, THATGREEN LINEY SPACE IN THE MIDDLE.
LET'S GET CREATIVE IN THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE, MAYBE PUTA PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAM ON
THAT THING.
AND THE NEW PLAN ALSO CALLS FORTHE WORLD'S LARGEST HD LED
VIDEO SCREENS, WHICH WILL BESHOWING A CONSTANT STREAM OF THE
NFL RED ZONE FEED, SO FANS CANWATCH THE JAGUARS WHILE KEEPING
UP WITH THE REST OF THE LEAGUEOR TRACKING THEIR FANTASY TEAM.
WHICH FOR JAGUAR FANS IS ANYOTHER TEAM.
[LAUGHTER]NEXT UP ON THE SPORT REPORT,
HOCKEY.
OR AS SOME CALL IT, ICE SOCCER.
OR AS I CALL IT, COLD BORING.
[LAUGHTER]THE NEW YORK RANGERS AND THE
L.A. KINGS ARE BATTLING IT OUTIN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS.
AS ALWAYS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> YEAH.
AS ALWAYS, MY MONEY'S ON THECANADIAN TEAM, BUT THE REAL
COMPETITION HERE IS BETWEEN THEGOVERNORS WHO TRADITIONALLY BET
SOMETHING FROM THE TEAM'S HOMESTATE.
IN THIS CASE, IT'S CALIFORNIA'SGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN VERSUS NEW
YORK'S GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.
AND THEY GOT A LOT RIDING ONTHIS SERIES.
>> IF THE RANGERS CELEBRATE LIKETHEY DID IN THE LAST ROUND,
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JERRY BROWNWILL SEND ANDREW CUOMO A BOX OF
ORGANIC CALIFORNIA RACE CAKES.
>> Stephen: AND BOOM GO THERICE CAKES. NEW YORK COULD WIN,
A WHOLE BOX OF ORGANIC RICECAKES AND FOR FLAVOR, GOVERNOR
BROWN IS MAILING IT IN A BOXFILLED WITH DELICIOUS PACKING
PEANUTS. I FOR ONE APPLAUD THEGOVERNOR'S CHOICE OF ORGANIC
RICE CAKES. THE ONLY THING MORESTEREOTYPICALLY JERRY BROWN
CALIFORNIA HE COULD HAVEWAGERED WOULD HAVE BEEN A WIND
CHIME MADE OUT OF RECYCLEDONE-HITTERS.
BUT THE STAKES, FOLKS, THESTAKES GET EVEN HIGHER IF NEW
YORK LOSES.
>> IF THE KINGS WIN, BROWN WILLGET A COMMEMORATIVE HOCKEY PUCK
CELEBRATING NEW YORK'S THREECONSECUTIVE ON-TIME BUDGETS.
>> Stephen:, NO, NO WE CAN'TLOSE NEW YORK'S LEGENDARY
THREE-ON-TIME BUDGET HOCKEY PUCK WHICH WAS COMMISSIONED BY
GOVERNOR CUOMO IN 2013 TOCOMMEMORATE HIS HAT TRICK OF
FULFILLING THE BASIC OBLIGATIONSOF HIS OFFICE.
IT'S OUR PROUDEST TROPHY OFGOVERNMENTAL
SELF-CONGRATULATION SINCEGOVERNOR AL SMITH'S "WE HAVE
PAVED ROADS" BASEBALL BAT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]AT LEAST WE CAN TAKE SOME
COMFORT IN THE FACT THATGOVERNOR CUOMO IS STILL FIRMLY
IN POSSESSION OF THE BASEBALLTHAT COMMEMORATES THIS YEAR'S
GRAND SLAM FOURTH ON-TIMEBUDGET.
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT ABASEBALL HAS DO WITH THE BUDGET.
IT'S NOT A PUCK.
[LAUGHTER]THINK, THINK IF YOU CAN, THINK
OF WHAT THE LOSS OF THIS PUCKWOULD MEAN TO NEW YORK'S TOURISM
INDUSTRY.
MILLIONS HAVE COME FROM ALL OVERTHE WORLD TO MARVEL AT OUR THREE
ON-TIME BUDGETS.
IT'S EVEN IN OUR SONG.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]♪ START SPREADING THE NEWS
I'M LEAVING TODAY♪ I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT
HAPPENED♪ THREE ON-TIME BUDGETS
I WANT TO WAKE UP♪ IN A STATE THAT'S GOT THE
STANLEY CUP♪ OR IF WE DO LOSE A GAME
STILL KEEP OUR PUCK♪ OUR STATE'S FISCAL BLUES
HAVE MELTED AWAY♪ THANKS TO THE BOLD LEADERSHIP
OF GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO♪ AND HIS MAGIC PUCK
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUR PUCK♪ WHO WANTS RICE CAKES?
WHAT THE [BLEEPED]♪ I'D RATHER EAT OUR BUDGET
PUCK ♪♪WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
