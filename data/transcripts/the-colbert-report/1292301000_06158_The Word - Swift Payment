STUDIO.
I'M GOING TO WORK OUT THIS YEAR.
NATION, THESE WALL STREET
BONUSES JUST PROVE THE OLD
SAYING, "THE RICH GET RICHER,
AND THE POOR... DO SOMETHING.
I DON'T REALLY CARE.
WHAT BUT ECONOMIC HELP FOR ALL
AMERICANS IS ON THE WAY BECAUSE
THE BUSH TAX CUTS FOR THE
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS ARE
EXPECTED TO PASS THIS WEEK, AND
ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL
BUDGET CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
OFFICE, THESE TAX CUTS FOR THE
TOP 2% WILL REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE-TENTH OF A
PERCENT AND ZERO PERCENT.
BUT BERNIE SANDERS TOOK TO THE
FLOOR OF THE SENATE ON FRIDAY
AND RAILED AGAINST THE TAX CUTS
FOR EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS.
>> TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS DOES
NOT WORK.
GIVING TAX BREAKS TO
BILLIONAIRES DOES NOT STIMULATE
THE ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: HEY, WE RICH GUYS
TRY STIMULATE THE ECONOMY BY
THROWING CASH AROUND.
JUST LAST WEEK I HAD MY
SILVERWARE BRONZED TO
COMMEMORATE THE TIME I HAD IT
GOLD PLATED.
BUT GUYS LIKE SANDERS WON'T BEES
AS FIND UNTIL WE REDISTRIBUTE
THE WEALTH.
WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY
THIS, FOLKS, BUT SOMEONE HAS
FOUND A WAY TO DO THAT IN A WAY
I CAN APPROVE.
AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'SED
"WORD."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SWIFT PAYMENT.
LAST WEEK MEDIA MOGUL AND FONDA
SURVIVOR TED TURNER SPOKE AT AN
ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE WHERE
HE PROPOSED A NOVEL IDEA TO
SOLVE GLOBAL WARMING.
HE SUGGESTED THAT COUNTRIES
SHOULD FOLLOW CHINA'S LEAD IN
INSTITUTING A ONE-CHILD POLICY
TO REDUCE GLOBAL POPULATION OVER
TIME.
YOU SEE, IN CHINA, YOU CAN HAVE
ONLY ONE CHILD.
THAT MAKES SURE THE ONLY BIG
BROTHER YOU'LL EVER HAVE IS BIG
BROTHER.
NOW, I KNOW...
( LAUGHTER )
I KNOW SOME OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
SAYING, BUT, STEPHEN, DOESN'T
TED TURNER HAVE FIVE CHILDREN,
TO WHICH I SAY, STOP TALKING TO
YOUR TV.
I CAN'T SEE OR HEAR YOU.
WELL, TED TURNER IS WAY AHEAD OF
YOU.
HE SAYS FERTILITY RIGHTS SHOULD
BE SOLD SO THAT POOR PEOPLE
COULD PROFIT FROM THEIR DECISION
NOT TO REPRODUCE.
THE RICH COULD SIMPLY BUY POOR
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN.
IT'S LIKE CAP AND TRADE IF THE
CAP WERE THIS.
( LAUGHTER )
SOME PEOPLE SEE LIFE, LIBERTY
AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS AS
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, BUT
VISIONARIES LIKE TED TURNER SEE
THEM AS MENU OPTIONS.
SURE, POOR PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE
WHO SELL THEIR REPRODUCTION
RIGHTS WON'T CONTINUE THEIR
FAMILY NAME OR KNOW THE JOY OF
RAISING A CHILD, BUT THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO BUY 52-INCH FLAT SCREEN.
NOW, THIS IS DOES RAISE SOME
TROUBLING QUESTIONS, LIKE WHAT
OTHER RIGHTS OF THE POOR CAN WE
TREAT LIKE FUNGIBLE COMMODITIES?
FOR INSTANCE, EVERYBODY'S
GUARANTEED FREEDOM OF RELIGION,
BUT WE COULD BUY THAT FROM THE
POOR AN MAKE THEM PRAY FOR THE
RICH.
WE'LL SEE WHO INHERITS THE EARTH
NOW.
BUT THE POOR ONLY HAVE SO MANY
RIGHTS TO SELL OFF.
THANKFULLY TED TURNER HAS
MENTIONED ANOTHER EFFECT OF
GLOBAL WARMING.
>> IT WILL BE EIGHT DEGREES
HOTTER IN 30 OR 40 YEARS AND
BASICALLY NONE OF THE CROPS WILL
GROW, MOST OF US WILL HAVE DIED
AND THE REST OF US WILL BE
CANNIBALS.
>> Stephen: IF WE DON'T
CONTROL GLOBAL WARMING, TED
TURNER IS GOING CANNIBAL.
YOU CAN'T SAY HE DIDN'T WARN US.
WHEN THAT DAY COME, THE RICH CAN
REDISTRIBUTE THEIR WEALTH BY
PURCHASING POOR KIDS AS FOOD.
JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET THE
BREAST-FED ONES.
YOU GET A CHILD WHO IS USING
FORMULA, THE MEAT IS KIND OF
GAMEY.
I EVEN FOUND SOME GREAT
PRECIPITATION TIPS BY A GUY
NAMED JOHN SWIFT.
I THINK, I THINK HE WAS FAMOUS
COOK BACK IN ENGLAND.
HE SAYS, A YOUNG, HEALTHY CHILD,
WELL NURSED, IS AT A YEAR OLD A
MOST DELICIOUS, NOURISHING AND
WHOLESOME FOOD WHETHER STEWED,
ROASTED, BAKED OR BOILED.
FOLKS, JUST WATCH YOUR PORTION
SIZE.
OTHERWISE THOSE CHUBBY THIGHS
WILL GO RIGHT TO YOUR CHUBBY
THIGHS.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, SOME POOR PEOPLE MAY NOT
WANT THEIR FUTURE CHILDREN SOLD
OR EATEN.
BUT WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?
RAISING TAXES ON THE RICH JUST
LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN
