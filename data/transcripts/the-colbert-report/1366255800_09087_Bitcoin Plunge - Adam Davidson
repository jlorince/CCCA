>> Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW DID THIS UNREGULATED
IMAGINARY CURRENCY INVENTED BY
AN ANONYMOUS HACKER AND BACKED
BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF
YOU-TUBE COMMENTS EVER GO WRONG?
HERE TO TELL ME, PLEASE WELCOME
ONE OF THE HOSTS OF N.P.R.'S
PLANET MONEY, ADAM DAVIDSON.
ADAM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
ADAM, SO WHAT CAUSED THIS CRASH,
OKAY?
WAS THERE A BIT-COIN BUBBLE?
>> WHICH CRASH AND WHICH BUBBLE
Stephen: THE CRASH THAT JUST
HAPPENED THIS PAST WEEK WHERE IT
WAS AT $266 AND WENT DOWN TO $56
OR SOMETHING.
>> IT WENT UP TO 100 AND DOWN TO
60 AND DOWN TO 95 JUST TODAY.
>> Stephen: AT THIS MOMENT DO I
BUY OR SELL BIT-COIN, THIS
SECOND?
>> NEVER BUY BIT-COIN WOULD BE
MY ADVICE
>> Stephen: IT'S A HOT NEW
THING.
YP SHOULDN'T I BUY THE THING
THAT IS SOMETIMES WORTH
SOMETHING?
>> IF YOU DO HAVE MONEY THAT YOU
HAVE NO NEED TO USE EVER AGAIN
IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS WITH IT, THAT'S A
REASONABLE INVESTMENT BUT
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO
KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH
IN FIVE MINUTES LET ALONE FIVE
YEARS.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANYWAY OF
KNOWING WHAT GOLD IS WORTH
BECAUSE GOLD IS... WHAT IS GOLD
WORTH?
GOLD JUST TANKED.
THE WORST DAY IN 33 YEARS.
>> THE PROBLEM WITH THINKING TOO
MUCH ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS IS
YOU START THINKING, WAIT, WHAT
IS MONEY?
WHAT IS VALUE?
>> Stephen: ADAM, WHAT IS MONEY?
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DON'T I GET ABOUT BIT-COIN?
HOW IS IT NOT MONEY?
>> WELL, IT IS MONEY.
I LIKE MONEY.
BUT MONEY THAT HAS A VERY LONG
HISTORY OF BACKING BY A
GOVERNMENT LIKE THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT THAT HAS
HUNDREDS OF YEARS, TRILLIONS AND
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
>> Stephen: HOW DID BIT-COIN GET
WHERE IT IS IF THERE IS NOTHING
BEHIND IT, HOW DID IT GET THERE?
>> IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLY COOL
COMPUTER PROGRAM.
IT HAS FIGURED OUT ALL SORTS OF
THINGS ABOUT HOW TO CREATE TRUST
AMONG WEIRD STRANGERS ON THE
INTERNET WHO WILL NEVER MEET
EACH OTHER.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
PYRAMID SCHEME OR SOMETHING.
COULD THERE BE SOME GUY AT THE
MIDDLE OF THIS WHO CREATED IT
WHO IS JUST RAKING IN ALL THE
CASH AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS IS A
CASH.
>> THE GUY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
OR THE GUYS OR THE GIRLS OR THE
COMPUTER
>> Stephen: WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO
MADE IT.
>> WE KNOW A NAME BUT WE KNOW
NOBODY IS CALLED THAT.
SOMEBODY OUT THERE SAYS...
>> Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE A
FAKE NAME.
THERE A PLACE WHERE BIT-COIN IS?
>> IT'S KIND OF LIKE BIT-TORRENT
IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ALL...
>> Stephen: ALL PORNOGRAPHY.
AND GAME OF THRONES.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH
IT OTHER THAN TO HAVE IT?
CAN YOU DO THINGS WITH THIS?
>> YES, THERE ARE WAYS TO USE IT
TO BUY AND SELL
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE PEOPLE
BUYING MOSTLY WITH IT?
>> DRUGS, CREDIT CARDS.
ILLEGAL
>> Stephen: YOU CAN BUY DRUGS
NOW THOUGH?
WHAT'S THE VALUE OF BUYING DRUGS
WITH BIT-COIN.
>> FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO DO
SOMETHING SHADY OR SOMEONE WHO
IS JUST A FANATIC APT EYE
GOVERNMENT LIBERTARIAN IS
THERE'S NO WAY TO TRACK YOU.
IF YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD
ONLINE THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHO
YOU ARE.
>> Stephen: NO ONE BUYS DRUGS
WITH A CREDIT CARD, MAN.
LIKE $20.
YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS TRACING
THAT, YOU KNOW, NOTHING, YOU
KNOW, TUNE IN.
CASH IS UNTRACEABLE.
>> CASH IS UNTRACEABLE BUT YOU
DO HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE.
TODAY I WANTED TO BUY BIT-COINS
SO I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS
LIKE.
AND WHAT I FOUND WAS A GUY NAMED
TRADER 675 WAS WILLING TO MEET
ME FOR CASH SO THERE WOULD BE NO
TRACEABLE, YOU KNOW, NO CREDIT
CARD TRANSACTION
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ON THE N.P.R.
RIGHT?
>> OKAY
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS TAKE
BIT-COIN IN EXCHANGE FOR LIKE
TOTE BAGS?
DO YOU GUYS TAKE IT AS A
DONATION?
>> WE DON'T YET.
Stephen: MAYBE, IF BIT-COIN
GETS THERE, WE KNOW BIT-COIN HAS
MADE IT.
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
