ALSO-- THERE ARE SO MANY LIES INIT!

IS IT A TWO-WAY STREET, WHEN YOURECAPTURE THAT VOICE BY READING
ABOUT YOURSELF WHAT, DO YOUTHINK SHE WOULD SAY TO YOU?
>> SHE WOULD PROBABLY SAY I'MTOUGH I CAN MAKE IT.
INDEED, I DID.
BUT IN A CAREER YOU HAVE YOURUPS AND YOUR DOWNS.
NOT FOR YOU, NOT FOR YOU.
>> Stephen:  IT'S BEEN ONEROCKET RIDE TO HEAVEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S TRUE.
I HAVE FOLLOWED YOU, AND IT ISTRUE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
THE REST OF US HIT SNAGS ALLTIME, BUT NOT YOU.
>> Stephen:  WHAT'S IT LIKE TOBE DIVINE?
YOU ARE THE DIVINE MISS M..
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANSWHEN IT'S APPLIED TO YOU, "THE
DIVINE?">> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO ODD--
YOU CAN TAKE IT IN TWO WAYS.
I THOUGHT-- YOU KNOW WHEN I WASA GIRL, I USED TO READ ALL THESE
SORT OF VARIOUS GOSSIPY BOOKSAND PEOPLE WOULD GO AROUND
SAYING,"YOU'RE SO DIVINE,DARLING.
YOU'RE DIVINE."
AND I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS LIKEFUN, BE DIVINE.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE GOD-LIKEQUALITY OF IT, I DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCE TO THESPIRITUALITY OF IT.
AND REALLY THE TRUTH IS, IF YOUSAY YOU'RE DIVINE ENOUGH, YOU
ACTUALLY DO BECOME RATHERGOD-LIKE, BUT IN FACT --
>> Stephen:  ISN'T THAT ABURDEN?
>> NO, NOT FOR ME.
NOT FOR ME.
( LAUGHTER )I'M ALWAYS STRUGGLING TO BE ONE
WITH GOD.
I'M ALWAYS STRUGGLING.
YES, I AM, IT'S TRUE.
IN FACT I TOLD MY DAUGHTER ANDHUSBAND I WAS A MESSIAH.
AND THEY BELIEVED ME.
>> Stephen:  THAT STORY OFTENENDS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ROUGH.
>> VERY BADLY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  IT HAS A HAPPYENDING, BUT IN BETWEEN, THERE'S
A TROUGH.
>> YES, YES.
I DO-- I'VE SEEN THE PICTURE.
I SAW THE MOVIE.
>> Stephen:  YOU DESCRIBEDYOURSELF AS SOMETHING OF A
MISFIT.
EVERYBODY LIKES YOU.
HOW COULD YOU BE A MISFIT?
>> I WAS BORN IN HAWAII, AND IWAS BORN IN HAWAII IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE LAST CENTURY-- I'M NOTGOING TO TELL YOU WHEN.
I WAS BORN IN HAWAII, AND INTHOSE DAYS, THE DAYS THAT I WAS
GROWING UP, WHITE PEOPLE WERECONSIDERED THE ENEMY.
AND IF YOU WERE WHITE THEYCALLED YOU THINGS LIKE HOLLY
CRAB OR ( BLEEP ) OR THIS ORTHAT.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DOES HOWLYMEAN?
>> WHITE PERSON.
FOLLOW ALONG, HONEY, FOLLOWALONG.
WHITE, WHITE.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T SPEAKALOHA.
>> HAWLEY MEANS A FOREIGNER ANDIT REFERS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE
WHITE.
>> Stephen:  DID YOU HAVE TODEVELOP A CHARACTER?
>> I DID, I REALLY DID.
I DEVELOPED A LOT OF ARMOR INTHOSE DAYS.
IT WAS OKAY.
IT REALLY WAS OKAY.
WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT IACTUALLY COULD MAKE THOSE PEOPLE
WHO WERE NOT HAPPY WITH MELAUGH, THIS WAS A BIG STEP
FORWARD FOR ME.
AND, REALLY, I NEVER LOOKED BACKFROM THAT.
THINGS CHANGED FOR ME ONE ILEARNED THAT I COULD MAKE PEOPLE
LAUGH.
AND THEN ONCE I WENT TO A HIGHSCHOOL WHERE THERE HAPPENED TO
BE A FEW MORE WHITE PEOPLE THANME, SO I KNOW ABOUT
DISCRIMINATION.
I KNOW ABOUT THAT.
BECAUSE I FELT IT.
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.
AND MY DAD WAS FANTASTIC.
MY DAD WAS LIKE EVERYBODY'SSWELL.
EVERYBODY'S GREAT.
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT COLORYOU WERE.
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOUWERE.
HE WAS THE MOST TOLERANT MAN IEVER MET AND I THINK I GOT A LOT
OF THAT FROM HIM.
>> Stephen:  HOW LONG DID YOUDO THIS CHARACTER THE DIVINE
MIS"M"?
>> I'M STILL DOING IT.
I SHOWED UP HERE, DIDN'T I?
I HAVE BEEN DIVINE FOR ABOUT-- ISTARTED OUT, I THINK SINCE 1967.
I CLAIMED MYSELF DIVINE IN 1967,
AND I NEVER CHANGED MY TUNE.
>> Stephen:  SO YOU CAN MAKEAN ENTIRE CAREER OF PLAYING A
CHARACTER OF YOURSELF.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )BETTE MIDLER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:  BETTE MIDLER, THEBOOK IS "A VIEW FROM A BROAD."
