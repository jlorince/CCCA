THANK YOU.
TOO KIND.
FOLKS, LONG TIME VIEWERS OF
THIS BROADCAST KNOW THAT I
HAVE AN ONGOING FEUD WITH
SIR RICHARD BRANSON, THE
REBEL BILLIONAIRE FAMOUS FOR
VIRGIN AIRLINES, VIRGIN
MOBILE, KITE SURFING WITH A
NAKED MODEL CLINGING TO HIS
BACK LIKE A SHAVED SPIDER
MONKEY AND FOR HAVING WHAT
SOME CRITICS HAVE CALLED
FACIAL HAIR.
WELL, SIR DICK HAS A NEW
VENTURE.
THE FIRST IPAD ONLY MAGAZINE
PROJECT.
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S GOT VIDEO ELEMENTS AND
I'M SURE THEY WILL
EVENTUALLY COME UP WITH A
NAME.
LAST MONTH'S COVER, LAST
MONTH'S COVER WAS JEFF
BRIDGES.
THERE YOU GO.
LOOK AT THAT.
THERE'S JEFF, SEE IT'S GOT A
LITTLE VIDEO ELEMENT, UNLESS
IT'S BROKEN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THIS MONTH THE NEW COVER
BOY IS-- STEPHEN COLBERT.
(APPLAUSE)
AS YOU CAN SEE I REALLY
TRIED TO GET INSIDE BRANDON
BRANDON-- BRANSON'S HEAD.
NOW I'M SURE YOU ARE SAYING
STEPHEN, HOW FAR DID YOU GO.
DID YOU KITE SURF WITH A
NUDE MODEL ON YOUR BACK.
NO, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO KITE SURF.
BUT I DO KNOW HOW TO VACUUM,
JIM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY, FOLKS, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT THE MODEL.
SHE LIVES A COMFORTABLE LIFE
AT BRANSON'S FREE RANGE
MODEL FARM.
YOU WILL FIND THAT, THE
INTERVIEW AND MORE VIDEOS
ALL IN THE ARTICLE.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU
WILL FIND IN THERE THAT
RICHARD BRANSON IS A COWARD
BECAUSE BRANSON CLAIMS TO BE
ONE OF THE GREATEST SAILORS
IN THE WORLD WITH THE
FASTEST BOAT IN THE WORLD,
VIRGIN MONEY.
AND WHEN HE INTERVIEWED ME
FOR PROJECT MAGAZINE I
CHALLENGED HIM TO RACE ME
FOR MY HOME TOWN CHARLESSTON,
SOUTH CAROLINA, TO BERMUDA
THIS MAY 2 1st.
AND I GAVE HIM 24 HOURS TO
ANSWER ME.
SO FAR, NOTHING.
I STAY HE EITHER ACCEPTS MY
CHALLENGE OR I AM OFFICIALLY
THE GREATEST SAILOR IN THE
WORLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND NATION, I NEED YOUR
HELP.
I AM TURNING YOU LOSE ON
RICHARD BRANSON.
E-MAIL HIM.
FACEBOOK AT HIM.
BURY HIM IN AN AVALANCHE OF
TWITTER TAUNT.
I WANT YOU TO POP A HASHTAG
IN HIS ASS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SO PUT YOUR
RUDDER WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS,
BRANSON.
ANYWAY, WILL YOU WANT TO GET
THE COOL NEW PROJECT
MAGAZINE WITH ME ON THE
COVER.
ACT NOW.
BECAUSE AS MY WIFE HAS MADE
QUITE CLEAR, A PHOTO SHOOT
