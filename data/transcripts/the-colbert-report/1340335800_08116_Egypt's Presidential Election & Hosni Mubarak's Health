>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
PLEASE, HEROES, HAVE A SEAT.
NATION, LAST YEAR, WE WERE ALL SWEPT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE ARAB SPRING.
ESPECIALLY IN EGYPT LAST FEBRUARY WHEN YOUNG PRODEMOCRACY PROTESTERS FILLED CAIRO'SICA
TEAR SQUARE AND OUSTED LONGTIME STRONG MAN HOSNI MUBARAK.
IT WAS A TRAUMATIC TIME FOR EGYPTIANS AND AN EVEN MORE TRAUMATIC TIME FOR THE BATHROOM
AT THE TAHRIR SQUARE PARTY PARTY.
(  LAUGHTER  ) NOW IT'S A COMPLEX SITUATION SO
LET ME RECAP WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN EGYPT.
5,000 YEARS AGO, SETTLEMENTS IN THE VALLEY UNITED TO FORM THE FIRST DYNASTY.
THEN PYRAMIDS, CLEOPATRA, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, CUT TO LAST FEBRUARY.
PRESIDENT MUBARAK STEPS DOWN HANDING TEMPORARY POWER TO THE MILITARY.
THEN IN NOVEMBER, EGYPTIANS VOTED IN THEIR FIRST FREE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, HANDING
A STRONG MAJORITY TO THE CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
THEN THERE WAS A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITH 13 CANDIDATES THAT LED TO A RUNOFF BETWEEN THE
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
EGYPT'S TOP COURT APPOINTED BY MUBARAK DISSOLVED PARLIAMENT AND CLAIMED ALL LEGISLATIVE POWER
FOR ITSELF.
THE BROTHERHOOD REFUSED TO CAPITULATE.
THEY HELD PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, BOTH CANDIDATES CLAIMED THEY WON AND NOW OFFICIALS ARE DELAYING
ANNOUNCING THE WINNER AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO'S IN CHARGE.
THEY EVEN CHECKED FOR BABIES IN THE BASKETS ON THE THE NILE.
NOTHING.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, LOOKING AT THE BIG
PICTURE, I THINK THE ANSWER HERE IS OBVIOUS-- EGYPT NEEDS A STRONG LEADER WITH EXPERIENCE.
AND A BOLD VISION FOR BEATING HIS OPPONENTS WITH TRUNCHEONS,
HOSNI MUBARAK.
HE'S A U.S. ALLY.
AND IT'S TIME TO BRING HIM BACK.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.
>> THIS IS CNN'S BREAKING NEWS.
>> THE STATE-RUN MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY IN CAIRO IS NOW REPORTING THAT HOSNI MUBARAK IS
CLINICALLY DEAD.
>> HE HAS HAD A STROKE.
HE HAS HAD A STROKE IN HIS HEART.
HE'S HAD A HEART ATTACK.
HIS HEART HAS STOPPED.
HE HAS BEEN DEAD.
HE'S BEEN IN A COMA.
>> HE'S LING TO LIFE.
>> HOSNI MUBARAK IS ON THE BRINK OF DEATH.
>> TODAY HIS SUPPORTERS SAY HE'S BEEN TAKEN OFF A RESPIRATOR AND IT DOING MUCH BETTER.
>> IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT HIS FRIENDS HERE HE'S ONLY MOSTLY DEAD.
>> Stephen:  YES, HOSNI IS A FRIEND AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS DEAD LAST WEEK REALLY HAS ME
WORRIED ABOUT HIS HEALTH.
(  LAUGHTER  ) HOSNI, YOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU.
STAY STRONG.
