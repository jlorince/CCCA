FOLKS, YOU KNOW NOW THATTHANKSGIVING HAS COME AND GONE

SEASON.
BUT THERE'S STILL TIME FOR THESECULAR CHRISTMAS HATERS OUT

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: NATION, IF YOU
KNOW YOUR BIBLE I'M SURE YOU'REA FAMILIAR WITH THE PARABLE OF
HOW ERNEST SAVED CHRISTMAS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE VAT CANT ISDRAGGING ITS FEET ON MAKING THIS
MAN A SAINT.
IN FACT, SAVING CHRISTMAS ISSOMETHING OF A CHRISTMAS
TRADITION BUT THIS YEARCHRISTMAS IS RETURNING THE FAVOR
BECAUSE LAST WEEK A CHRISTMASTREE SAVED A FAMILY FROM A
BULLET.
(LAUGHTER)>> A FAMILY'S HOUSE WAS HIT BY A
STRAY BULLET DURING A DRIVE-BYSHOOTING.
ONE FAMILY SAYS THINGS COULDHAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT WORSE IF
IT WEREN'T FOR WHERE THECHRISTMAS TREE WAS.
>> WELL I WAS SITTING ON MYCOUCH RIGHT THERE AND I HEARD
SIX, EIGHT LOUD POPS.
IF THE TREE WASN'T HERE WE WOULDHAVE HAD THE COUCH RIGHT
UNDERNEATH THE WINDOWS.
>> Stephen: WHAT AN INSPIRINGACT OF COURAGE.
(LAUGHTER)BY SILENTLY VOLUNTEERING TO BE
PUT WHERE THE COUCH HAD BEEN THETREE PLACED ITSELF IN THE LINE
OF FIRE AND WHEN THE SHOOTINGBEGAN, THE TREE DIDN'T HESITATE
TO NOT MOVE.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IT WAS JUST A
MONTH AWAY FROM RETIRING.
NOW, AUTHORITIES SAY THE TREEWILL RECOVER FROM THE BULLET BUT
PROBABLY NOT BEING CHOPPED OFFBY THE ROOTS AND DRAG INDOORS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT I SAY IF OUR CHRISTMAS TREES
ARE WILLING TO SHOW THIS KIND OFBRAVERY, LET'S AT LEAST MAKE IT
A FAIR FIGHT.
TIME TO GET RID OF THE ONEROUSGOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
PREVENTING TREES FROM HAVINGGUNS.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, INEVITABLY, YES, A TREE
HERE OR THERE WILL GO CRAZY ANDTURN ITS ORNAMENTS ON THE
FAMILY, BUT IT'S NOT THE GUNS'FAULT.
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURETREES GET THE MENTAL HEALTH
TREATMENT THAT THEY DESPERATELYNEED.
BESIDES, NO ONE SHOULD GET HURTAS LONG AS NO ONE BREAKS INTO
THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THENIGHT, SAY DOWN A CHIMNEY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
