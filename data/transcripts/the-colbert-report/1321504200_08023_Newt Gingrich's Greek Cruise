REPORT TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
NATION, IT'S WEDNESDAY.
AND THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR A
NEW G.O.P. FRONT-RUNNER.
( LAUGHTER )
JIM.
>> ONCE GIVEN UP FOR POLITICAL
ROADKILL NEWT GINGRICH KILLING
THEM ALL.
IN THE LATEST POLLING HE IS THE
FRONT-RUNNER.
>> THERE IS A P.P.P. POLL
SHOWING NEWT GINGRICH, 38, MITT
ROMNEY 18.
>> Stephen:  IT MAKES SENSE
GINGRICH IS RISING.
HE APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY
CANDIDATE WHO APPEARS TO BE MADE
OF DOUGH.
NEWT'S CAMPAIGN GOT OFF TO A BIT
OF A ROCKY START.
BACK IN JUNE, INSTEAD OF
CAMPAIGNING IN IOWA, NEWT WONT A
TWO-WEEK LUXURY CRUISE THROUGH
THE GREEK ISLE ABORN THE
"SEABORN ODYSSEY."
IN RESPONSE HIS STAFF QUIT AND
HIS DONORS ABANDONED HIM, BUT
YESTERDAY WE LEARNED THAT WAS NO
PLEASURE CRUISE.
IT WAS A PLEASURE FACT-FINDING
MISSION.
AS NEWT EXPLAINED TO IOWA
VOTERS, "I VISITED GREECE IN
JUNE.
I TALKED TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT
THEY WERE FACED WITH IN GREECE,
AND I LISTENED TO THEM, AND I
TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY
FACED A CRISIS OF ENORMOUS
PROPORTIONS."
YES, AND WE HAVE SOME ACTUAL
FOOTAGE OF THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT
WHERE NEWT GOT FIRSTHAND
INFORMATION ABOUT THE GREEK DEBT
CRISIS ABOARD THE LUXURIOUS
"SEABORN ODYSSEY," RUBBING
ELBOWS AND WHITE GLOVES WITH
YOUR AVERAGE JORGOS, ON THE RED
CARPET AT THE AWL YOU CAN SWILL
MION MOASA BU-- MIMOSA BUFFETS,
AND THE ROMAN BATHS.
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE GREEK
PARLIAMENT THERE.
THERE WAS UNREST ON THE LIDO
DECK.
THERE IS A PROTEST WER MOLOTOV
KEBOBS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE.
IT LOOKS SEXY.
JAMES CARVILLE WAS ON BOARD OF
CRUISE.
AND HERE IS NEWT STAYING
HYDRATED, VERY IMPORTANT WHEN
YOU'RE DISCUSSING THE GREEK DEBT
CRISE.
AND NEWT'S EXPLANATION OF HIS
ALL-YOU-CAN-RESEARCH BOOZE
CRUISE PUTS ANY OF HIS SO-CALLED
SCANDALS IN A NEW LIGHT.
THAT HALF A MILLION DOLLAR LINE
OF CREDIT AT TIFFANIES?
HE WAS JUST STUDYING THE
RECKLESS SPENDING THAT IS
RUINING OUR ECONOMY.
HIS MILLION-PLUS FAKE TWITTER
FOLLOWERS.
A DARING EXPOAS A OF INTERNET
FRAUD.
THE THREE WIVES, TWO OF WHOM HE
CHEATED, ONE WHILE SHE WAS
BATTLING CANCER, THAT
WAS NOT GAY.
