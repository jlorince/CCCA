[APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
NATION, I HAVE SAID FOR YEARS
THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS A
FRAUD.
IF IT'S REALLY FIRST-CLASS MAIL,
WHY DOESN'T MY LETTER GET A
COMPLIMENTARY COCKTAIL ON A HOT
TOWEL?
WELL, FORTUNATELY THE POST
OFFICE IS ABOUT TO BE RETURNED
TO SENDER.
JIM?
>> A CRISIS AT THE U.S. POSTAL
SERVICE.
>> THE U.S. POST OFFICE IS GOING
BANKRUPT.
IT CAN'T PAY BACK THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT FOR LOANS, $5.5
BILLION IN LOANS.
>> WITH NO HELP, THE POST OFFICE
COULD DEFAULT BY THE END OF THIS
MONTH.
>> THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO, A
COMPLETE SHUTDOWN THIS WINTER
UNLESS CONGRESS STEPS IN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE SURVIVAL OF THE POST OFFICE
DEPENDS ON SWIFT CONGRESSIONAL
ACTION.
GOOD-BYE.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
AND, FOLKS, I SAY GOOD RIDDANCE.
REMEMBER, BEN FRANKLIN WAS THE
FIRST POST MASTER GENERAL, SO
CLEARLY THE WHOLE IDEA IS JUST
THE MAD RAMBLINGS OF A
SYPHILITIC BRAIN.
"I KNOW, I'LL GLUE A PRETTY
LITTLE PICTURE ON THE UPPER
RIGHT HAND CORNER OF AN
ENVELOPE.
I'LL DROP IT IN A BOX AND TWO
DAYS LATER IT WILL APPEAR IN
ANOTHER BOX MAGICALLY ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
THEN I SHALL FLY A KITE IN A
THUNDERSTORM.
FRENCH HORNS FOR ALL MY
FRIENDS."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MMM, MMM, MMM, A SNIFTER OF
MERCURY, MMM, MMM, MMM.
BESIDES, THE POST OFFICE'S
FINANCIAL CRISIS IS THE POST
OFFICE'S OWN FAULT.
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS MODEL IS
THE FOREVER STAMP?
THAT'S LIKE CHILI'S WITH THEIR
BOTTOMLESS COKE.
BY THE WAY, I'LL BE BACK
TONIGHT, CHILI'S.
DADDY'S STILL THIRSTY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BESIDES, WE DO NOT EVEN NEED THE
POST OFFICE ANYMORE, RIGHT?
>> PEOPLE AREN'T USING THE POST
OFFICE.
>> THEY HAVE POST OFFICES ALL
OVER THE PLACE.
CLOSE DOWN SOME.
>> OUR MONEY, THE TAXPAYERS'
MONEY, LET THE POST OFFICE GO.
>> FEDEX AND BLACKBERRY DO A
MUCH BETTER JOB ANYWAY.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BLACKBERRIES
ARE WAY BETTER.
YOU CAN'T PLAY BRICK BREAKER ON
AN ENVELOPE.
STUPID ENVELOPES.
AND IF GRANDMA REALLY WANTS TO
SEND YOU $5 ON YOUR BIRTHDAY,
SHE CAN FEDEX IT.
ALTHOUGH SHE -- YOU MAY WANT THE
SEND HER THE $5 BACK SO SHE CAN
COVER THE $15 MINIMUM.
THERE IS ONE DOWN SIDE TO THE
UNITED STATES BECOMING THE ONLY
CIVILIZED NATION WITHOUT A
POSTAL SERVICE.
I HAVE NOT YET APPEARED ON A
STAMP.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> I KNOW, I KNOW, I NO.
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER THEY'D
GO WITH THE YOUNG ME OR THE FAT
ME.
[APPLAUSE]
WORKING ON IT.
WELL, FOLKS, THAT ENDS TODAY.
GO TO COLBERTNATION.COM AND
ORDER A SET OF ACTUAL U.S.
POSTAGE STAMPS FEATURING ME
SENDING A FAREWELL E-MAIL TO THE
POST OFFICE ON MY SMART PHONE.
IT IS PERFECT FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS
CARDS.
[APPLAUSE]
