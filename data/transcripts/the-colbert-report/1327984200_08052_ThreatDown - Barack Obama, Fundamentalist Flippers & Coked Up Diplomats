HEART.
NATION, YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
AND THE NEWS THAT AFFECTS
YOUR LIFE.
REMEMBER THAT STORY ABOUT
BRAIN EATING AM EVENAS IN
LOUISIANA TAP WATTER?
I REALLY VUD SHOULD IS HAVE
REPORTED ON THAT.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
FOLKS, I MEANT TO REPORT ON
THIS NEXT STORY EARLIER BUT
I WAS TOO BUSY NOT RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT.
THREAT NUMBER THREE,
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
JUST LISTEN TO THE SHOCKING
REVELATION HE UNLEASHED AT A
RECENT FUND-RAISER AT THE
APOLLO THEATRE I-- SO IN
LOVE WITH YOU ♪
♪
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD!
I THINK I JUST OVULATED.
NOW ONCE AGAIN, FOLKS, OBAMA
IS PLAYING HIS SAME OLD
DIRTY POLITICAL TRICK OF
BEING IRRESISTABLY APPEALING.
YOU'LL NEVER SEE NEWT
GINGRICH STOOP THAT LOW.
BUT WITH THOSE PIPES OBAMA
IS GOING TO BE UNSTOPPABLE
IN 2012, WHAT OTHER SULTRY
TALENTS COULD HE PULL OUT TO
WOO THE VOTERS, MAKING
HUSBAND HOME COOKED
FRITTATAS IN BED, GIVING
SPEECHES IN ITALIAN.
HE KNOWS I CAN'T RESIST A
MAN WHO CALLS ME
PRINCIPESSA.
I MEAN EVEN, EVEN IF THE
SINGING IS ALL HE'S GOT NO
OTHER CANDIDATE CAN MATCH
HIS VOICE.
AT LEAST IN THE LAST
ELECTION, WE HAD JOHN McCAIN
AND HIS OLD SINGING GROUP.
♪ WE REPRESENT THE LOLLIPOP
GUILD ♪
♪ THE LOLLIPOP GUILD ♪
♪.
>> Stephen: AND HE MIGHT
HAVE WON IF THAT HOUSE
HADN'T LANDED ON HIS RUNNING
MATE.
BUT FOLKS, MI CALLING--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I AM CALLING-- SHE
WILL BE MISSED.
SHE WILL BE MISSED.
I AM HEREBY CALL ON THE
REMAINING REPUBLICANS TO
FIGHT OBAMA'S SOUL MUSIC
WITH GLAM-ROCK.
GENTLEMEN, TEAM UP INTO ONE
SUPERGROUP AND GO THE FULL
KISS.
NEWT WOULD BE GENE SIMONS,
ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE NEWT HAS
SLEPT WITH MORE WOMEN.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, IN RESPONSE
TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS,
IRAN HAS THREATENED TO BLOCK
THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ, A
ROUTE USED TO TRANSPORT 20%
OF THE WORLD'S OIL AND 100%
OF THE WORLD'S HORMUZ.
BUT THE U.S. NAVY HAS A
PLAN.
>> ONE WAY IRAN COULD BLOCK
THE STRAIT IS WITH AN
ASSORTMENT OF MINES.
BUT THE U.S. NAVY HAS A
PRETTY HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
STRATEGY TO GET AROUND THAT,
THE SECRET WEAPON, DOLPHINS.
>> THE BEST PROTECTORS OF
UNDERWATER MINES ARE NOT
SUBMARINES OR SATELLITE
COMMUNICATIONS, THEY ARE
DOLPHINS.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY HAVE
TRAINED DOLPHINS TO SWEEP
FOR MINES.
AMAZING.
YET I CAN'T EVEN GET MINE TO
RAKE THE YARD!
GET BACK IT WORK, KEVIN!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I JUST NEED
SOMEPLACE TO CRASH FOR A FEW
WEEKS.
THIS BRINGS ME TO THREAT
NUMBER TWO.
FUNDAMENTALIST FLIPPERS.
I AM TELLING YOU, FOLKS THIS
WILL BE JUST LIKE
AFGHANISTAN.
WE TRAIN THE LOCALS TO FIGHT
OUR ENEMIES, THEN THEY TURN
ON US.
BEFORE YOU KNOW T THEY'LL BE
MARINE MUJAHIDEEN.
WE HAVE SEEN THE FOOTAGE OF
THEIR TRAINING CAMPS.
WE KNOW THEY SPEAK IN CODE.
>> Stephen: I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S ARABIC.
AND NEED I REMIND YOU WE
DUMPED OSAMA BIN LADEN IN
THE OCEAN.
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL HE RECRUITS YOUNG
IMPRESSIONABLE MALE DOLPHINS
BY PROMISING THEN AN
ETERNITY IN PARADISE WITH 72
HERRING.
WE MUST ABANDON THIS DOLPHIN
PROGRAM BEFORE IT'S TOO
LATE.
AND THEY DECLARE JEEE-EEE-HAD.
(APPLAUSE)
DIDN'T REALIZE-- DIDN'T KNOW
I SPOKE ARABIC, DID YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FINALLY,
ALARMING NEWS OUT OF THE
U.N., IN THAT THE U.N. IS
NEWS.
JIM?
>> POLICE IN NEW YORK SAY
SOMEBODY DELIVERED 35 POUNDS
OF COCAINE TO THE UNITED
NATIONS LAST WEEK.
THEY SAY THE COKE WAS
STASHED INSIDE THESE TWO
WHITE BAGS MADE TO LOOK LIKE
DIPLOMATIC POUCHES.
THE HEAD OF THE SECURITIES
UNITED NATIONS SAID SOMEBODY
PROBABLY USED THE LOGO IN
ORDER TO BYPASS INSPECTION
AT THE U. IS IS MEXICO
BORDER BUT NEVER INTENDED
FOR THE PACKAGE TO ACTUALLY
BE DELIVERED TO THE UNITED
NATIONS.
>> Stephen: WHICH BRINGS ME
TO THE NUMBER ONE THREAT IN
AMERICA, COKED UP DIPLOMATS.
FOLKS, THIS IS TERRIFYING.
WITH 35 POUNDS OF COCAINE,
THE UNITED NATIONS MIGHT
ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE.
I CAN JUST SEE
SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN
KI-MOON GETTING JACKED UP ON
THE ALL BINA RHINO AND
ANNOUNCING [BLEEP] LET'S
MAKE ONE OF THESE
RESOLUTIONS, BINDING.
GOD, GOD, I JUST LOVE-- I

DIPLOMACY BINGE WITH THEIR
HEAD PHONES ON SAYING DUDE,

TRANSLATION.

OH [BLEEP] THAT IS SO
NUANCED.
IT'S LIKE A TRANSLATION
INSIDE A TRANSLATION INSIDE
A CONDEMNATION OF ISRAEL.
YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S START A SOCIAL MEDIA
COMPANY, I'M SERIOUS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
EASY IT WOULD BE TO CURE
MALARIA, WE JUST NEED
MOSQUITO NETS AND POTABLE
WATER AND WE CAN WIPE OUT
HUNGER.
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE RIGHT
