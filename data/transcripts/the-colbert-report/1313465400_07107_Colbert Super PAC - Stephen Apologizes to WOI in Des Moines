>> Stephen: FOLKS, THERE IS
A LOT OF NEWS OUT THERE AND
WE WILL GET TO ALL OF IT, I
PROMISE YOU.
BUT FIRST I HAVE TO START BY
ISSUING A RARE APOLOGY.
IT GOES OUT-- I KNOW, I
KNOW.
IT GOES OUT TO THE TEAM AT
ABC CHANNEL 5 WOI DES MOINES
NEWS LIEDER.
LAST WEEK I ATTACKED WOI
WHEN THEIR GENERAL MANAGER
RAY COLE REFUSED TO AIR OUR
COLBERT REPORT SUPERPAC ADS.
YOU HAVE [BLEEP] WITH THE
WRONG PEOPLE!
COLBERT SUPERPAC IS 165,000
STRONG, BABY, HERE US ROAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I HAPPEN TO FOE
YOU HAVEN'T WON A LOCAL EMMY
IN TEN YEARS.
WANT TO TOUCH MINE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW THAT WAS A
LOW BLOW.
ALMOST AS LOW AS THE NUMBER
OF EMMIES THEY HAVE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT IT TURNS OUT
THAT I HAVE MET RAY COLE AND
HE HAS TOUCHED MY EMMY.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SEE, WHAT HAPPENED WAS--
(LAUGHTER)
IN 2008 WE HAD JUST WON OUR
FIRST EMMY AND NATURALLY I
WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO
CELEBRATE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE ONLY OTHER GENTLEMEN IN
THERE WHO I HAD NEVER MET
WAS RAY COLE.
HE OFFERED TO HOLD MY LITTLE
TROPHY WHILE I PEED.
(LAUGHTER)
I SAID I WOULD RATHER YOU
HOLD MY EMMY.
AND IN RETURN-- TRUE STORY,
TRUE STORY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> TRUE STORY, IN RETURN
WHEN HE PEED I HELD HIS
PACKAGE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> BY WHICH I MEAN THESE
LITTLE PARCELS HE'S HOLDING
DOWN THERE.
SO MY APOLOGIES.
DID YOU TOUCH MY EMMY AND
WHEN YOU HAVE TOUCHED MY
EMMY, YOU'VE TOUCHED THE
BEST OF ME.
SO LIKE MY CHILDREN, IN THAT
I LEGALLY ADOPT ALL
