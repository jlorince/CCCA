THE SOLE REASON THEY EXIST?
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FORTUNATELY, THERE IS A WAY
TO RAISE REVENUE WITHOUT ASKING
ANYTHING OF OUR JOB CREATORS AND
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DEATH AND TAXES, FOLKS, IF WE
DON'T FIND SOMEONE TO PAY THE
GOVERNMENT'S TAB SOON, CONGRESS
MAY GET DESPERATE ENOUGH TO DO
THE UNTHINKABLE-- WHAT THE
MAJORITY WANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
FORTUNATELY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
ANOTHER WAY.
>> LET'S GROW THE ECONOMY AND
CREATE JOBS, BROADEN THE TAX
BASE.
>> WE NEED TO LOWER TAX RATES
FOR CORPORATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS
AND BROADEN THE TAX BASE.
>> WE'VE GOT TO BROADEN THE
BASE.
>> WE NEED TO BROADEN THE BASE
SO THAT EVERYBODY PAYS
SOMETHING-- EVEN IF IT'S A
DOLLAR.
>> Stephen: YES.
WE NEED TO BROADEN THE BASE.
RIGHT NOW OUR ECONOMY IS
BALANCED ON SUCH A TINY BASE
THAT EVERY TIME WALL STREET
POURS ALL OF OUR MONEY INTO AN
ELABORATE SCHEME BASED ON THE
INABILITY OF POOR PEOPLE TO PAY
THEIR MORTGAGES IT COLLAPSES.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE QUESTION IS...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THE QUESTION IS, FOLKS, HOW DO
WE BROADEN IT?
WELL, LUCKILY...
(LAUGHTER)
AMERICA IS SITTING ON VAST
FIELDS OF UNTAPPED REVENUE.
>> WE'RE DISMAYED.
WE'RE DISMAYED AT THE INJUSTICE
THAT NEARLY HALF OF ALL
AMERICANS DON'T EVEN PAY ANY
INCOME TAX.
>> HALF THE PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY PAY NO INCOME TAX AT
ALL.
>> 47% PAY NOTHING.
EVERYONE SHOULD PAY SOMETHING
BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT.
>> Stephen: MICHELE BACHMANN IS
RIGHT.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO CONTRIBUTE
BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THE
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SHE HAS
PROMISED TO ELIMINATE ON DAY
ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
SO...
(LAUGHTER)
JUST HOW... JUST HOW DO THESE
FREELOADERS DODGE FEDERAL INCOME
TAXES?
WELL, IT TURNS OUT HALF OF THEM
DON'T PAY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY
MAKE LESS THAN
$20,000 A YEAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY ARE LIVING THE GOOD LIFE IN
THEIR CUSHY JOBS AS FRY COOKS,
WAL-MART GREETERS AND
SLAUGHTERHOUSE FLOOR GREAT
DEBRAINERS.
"OH, LOOK AT ME, ITCH MY OWN
APRON!"
AND BEFORE YOU CRY FOR THE POOR,
REMEMBER 90% OF SOUP KITCHENS
REPORTED INCREASED DEMAND OVER
THE LAST YEAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE SO-CALLED POOR HAVE SPECIAL
KITCHENS JUST FOR SOUP.
(LAUGHTER)
SO SAVE YOUR TEARS, FOLKS.
AND IT'S NOT JUST LOW INCOME
WORKERS BECAUSE OVER 20% OF
THESE MOOCHMERICANS ARE ELDERLY
PEOPLE ENJOYING TAX-FREE SOCIAL
SECURITY BENEFITS.
MONEY THEY USE TO FUEL THEIR
DECADENT LIFE-STYLES SITTING
AROUND THE HOUSE TAKING DRUGS
ALL DAY.
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT
STOP AT THE ELDERLY AND THE
WORKING POOR.
WE MUST ALSO TAX EVERYONE WHO
FOUND THE ULTIMATE LOOPHOLE IN
OUR INCOME TAX CODE-- HAVING NO
INCOME.
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF THE
16.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED
AMERICANS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T
PULL YOUR WEIGHT.
THAT'S WHY GOD GAVE YOU TWO
KIDNEYS!
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AND THOSE WHO SAY, OH, ARE YOU
GOING TO TAX THE POOR TO DEATH?
I SAY DEATH NO EXCUSE FOR NOT
PAYING THEIR SHARE!
I MEAN, JUST THINK...
(LAUGHTER)
JUST THINK OF THESE LAZY BONES
LYING ON THEIR BACKS ALL DAY IN
THEIR FANCY SATIN BOXES.
HEY, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
MY BED DOESN'T HAVE A LID.
(LAUGHTER)
SO, FOLKS, LET'S NOT JUST
BROADEN THE STACKS BASE, I SAY
WE NEED TO DEEPEN THE TAX BASE.
AND LET'S FORCE THESE CADAVERCAN
AMERICANS TO PAY IN THE FORM OF
RINGS, WATCHES, AND WHATEVER
ELSE WE CAN PRY FROM THEIR COLD,
DEAD HANDS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT IS NOT GRAVE ROBBING, IT'S
GRAVE SHARING!
BECAUSE TO SOLVE THE DEFICIT, WE
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAX THE
WORKING POOR, THE NON-WORKING
POOR, AND THE NON-LIVING POOR.
(LAUGHTER)
OTHERWISE, WE MIGHT HAVE TO
CONSIDER RAISING TAXES ON THE
WEALTHY.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
