ABOUT.
THOSE GUYS OVER THERE KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
PLUS, FOLKS, THE WHOLE-- THE WHOLE-- THE WHOLE ELECTION WAS MARRED BY VOTER IRREGULARITIES.
FIRST OF ALL, EAST COAST GOT TO VOTE THREE HOURS EARLIER.
THAT CAN'T BE FAIR.
( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN THERE WAS THAT ONE PLACE WHERE THAT ONE BLACK GUY WAS.
THAT'S SCARY STUFF.
AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY TRICK THE LIBERALS PULLED.
>> AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.
A MURAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WATCHING OVER VOTERS FOR HOURS AT ONE POLLING PLACE IN A SCHOOL.
ONLY AFTER COMPLAINTS WAS IT PARTIALLY COVERED UP.
>> THAT'S SOMETHING THEY WOULD EXPECT, MAYBE IN CHINA OR OLD-STYLE RUSSIA BUT NOT IN THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Stephen:  YES, BECAUSE VOTERS ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WHATEVER THEY SEE ON HIGH SCHOOL
WALLS WHICH IS WHY IN 2008, NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTED IN GOVERNOR "JEREMY PLUS ABBY 4-EVA."
( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) AND, NATION, I GOTTA TELL YOU, YESTERDAY MY OWN VOTING
EXPERIENCE LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED.
FOR ONE THING, MY BOOTH WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOILET PAPER.
( LAUGHTER ).
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I PULLED THAT LEVER IT WOULDN'T FLUSH, OKAY.
I JUST GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE.
I SAW ALL SORT OF VOTE IRREGULARITY.
YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CAMPAIGN WITHIN 100 FEET IN FRONT OF A POLLING STATION BUT I SAW
COUNTLESS SIGNS TELLING ME TO VOTE FOR A GUY NAMED AQUI.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND AMERICAN.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND AMERICAN TO ME.
AND THE ILLEGAL ELECTIONEERING WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE BALLOT ITSELF.
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHAT, DID VOTERS HAVE TO DO ON THEIR SCANTRON SHEETS?
FILL IN AN "O." WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT BEFORE?
AND NO SURPRISE, IT STARTS OUT WHITE AND YOU'RE FORCED TO FILL IT IN BLACK.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY!
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS' GAME.
AND, OF COURSE, THE DEMOCRATS HAD TO MAKE UNSUBSTANTIATED CHARGES THE REPUBLICANS TRIED
TRICKS, TOO.
>> REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST EVERY LEGISLATIVE EFFORT, AND SO THEY'RE RESORTING TO THEIR
OLD-SCHOOL TACTICS.
>> SO THIS IS THE "VOTE BY PHONE" SCAM REPORTED IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA PURPOSE
VOTERS TARGETED WITH FALSE INFORMATION ON ABILITY TO VOTE BY PHONES, ESPECIALLY SENIORS,
RECEIVING CALLS AND BEING TOLD THAT THEY CAN VOTE BY PHONE.
>> HUNDRED, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF ROBO CALLS WENT OUT THIS MORNING REMINDING VOTERS THEY HAVE UNTIL
7:00 P.M. TOMORROW NIGHT TO VOTE.
NOT THE CASE.
7:00 P.M. TONIGHT IS THE DEADLINE.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, I DON'T BUY TOKAY.
FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULDN'T WORK.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE ELECTION WAS YESTERDAY, AND THEY KNOW YOU CAN'T VOTE OVER THE PHONE.
EVEN IF OLD PEOPLE GOT THAT CALL THEY WOULD NEVER-- ( PHONE RINGING ) I'M SORRY.
HOLD ON.
THAT'S MY PHONE, HOLD ON.
HELLO?
>> ONE.
>> Stephen:  HOLO, WHO IS THIS PLEASE?
>> ONE.
ONE.
ONE.
>> Stephen:  WHO IS THIS?
>> IT'S WILFORD, WILFORD BRIMLEY.
>> Stephen:  WILFORD, WILFORD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M TRYING TO DO'S SHOW HERE.
>> I'M VOTING BY PHONE.
I GOT A CALL YESTERDAY TELLING ME I COULD VOTE TODAY AS LONG AS I DID IT OVER THE PHONE.
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PUSH OR SAY "ONE."
>> Stephen:  WILFORD--
>> ONE.
>> Stephen:  WILFORD WHY DID YOU CALL ME?
I GOT YOU ON THE SPEED GUILE DIAL.
YOU'RE ONE.
>> Stephen:  WILFORD YOU CAN'T VOTE BY PHONE.
HOW DARE YOU SUPPRESS MY VOTE AIRFARE SERVED MY COUNTRY.
I WAS A RODEO CLOWN.
>> Stephen:  I KNOW, WILFORD, I KNOW.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, BUT I'M NOT--
>> FINE, I'LL VOTE BY FAX.
( TONE DIALING ).
>> Stephen:  YOU CAN'T VOTE BY FAX, EITHER.
>> HELP!
ONE!
ONE!
>> Stephen:  WILFORD BRIMLEY, EVERYBODY.
TRY TO GET HIM BACK ON THE PHONE.
WILFORD, ARE YOU OKAY?
