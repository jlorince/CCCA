>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOLKS,
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

GREAT BLACK FRIDAY.
THE OFFICIAL KICKOFF OF THE
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON, IT'S
WHEN PARENTS PROVE THEY LOVE

SO IF YOU WEREN'T CAMPED OUT IN

HOPE YOU DID THE RIGHT THING AND
CALLED CHILD SERVICES ON YOU.

WHO HAS A HELPER NAMED "BLACK
PETER," A MISCHIEVOUS MORE WHO

AGAIN, AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES.

CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS.
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE
MISUNDERSTANDINGINGS.
I'M JUST GOING THE WAIT AND
CELEBRATE A HOLIDAY THAT WON'T
OFFEND ANYBODY, CHINESE NEW
YEAR, BECAUSE I
