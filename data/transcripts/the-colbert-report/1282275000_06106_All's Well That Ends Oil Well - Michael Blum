>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, IT LOOKS LIKE THE GULF
HAS COMPLETELY RECOVERED FROM
THE OIL SPILL.
THE BEACHES ARE ALL TAR BALL
FREE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SWAM IN IT, AND
ALL ACROSS THE REGION PEOPLE ARE
RETURNING TO THEIR EVERYDAY
LIVES OF ABJECT POVERTY.
BUT SOME SIGNS SAY THERE'S STILL
OIL IN MILES LONG UNDERWATER
PLUMES THAT CAN CONTAMINATE THE
FOOD CHAIN AND DEPLETE OXYGEN.
EXCUSE ME.
IF THERE'S OXYGEN UNDERWATER,
WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN ABLE TO
BREATH IT?
REALISTIC AQUAMAN COSTUME MY
ASS!
I ALMOST DROWNED.
WELL, THANK GOODNESS THE SPILL
GOT FIXED IN TIME FOR THE GULF'S
BIG ANNUAL EVENT.
NO, NOT MARDI GRAS OR THE DAY
BEFORE MARDI GRAS WHEN THEY
FINISH MOPPING UP THE VOMIT FROM
LAST YEAR'S MARDI GRAS, THIS.
>> IT WAS FIRST DAY OF SHOW
SEASON TODAY, AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME SINCE B.P.M. OIL BEGAN
SEEPING INTO LOUISIANA WATERS,
THE SHRIMP BOATS HEADED BACK TO
WORK.
>> YES, IT IS SHRIMP SEASON, AND
THE F.D.A. ASSURES ME THAT
SEAFOOD FROM THE GULF TESTED
BELOW THE LEVEL OF CONCERN FOR
HEALTH RISKS FROM PETROLEUM
COMPOUNDS.
BELOW THE LEVEL OF CONCERN FOR
HEALTH RISKS?
MMM.
MY MOUTH IS WATERING ALREADY.
AND FOLKS, THESE TESTS ARE
THOROUGH.
>> A MAJOR LINE OF DEFENSE
AGAINST OIL SEAFOOD STARTS WITH
A SNIFF.
>> IT PROBABLY HAS A GAS TAINT
TO IT OR A SLIGHT PETROLEUM
TAINT TO IT.
>> A PETROLEUM TAINT IS VERY
OBVIOUS.
>> OUR RIGOROUS PROTOCOLS ENABLE
US TO DETECT TAINT
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
OUR INSPECTORS ARE SO GOOD, THEY
CAN FIND SHRIMP TAINT BY SMELL.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS?
I NEED A JEWELER'S LOOP TO EVEN
SEE SHRIMP TAINT.
ALTHOUGH I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY
ABILITY TO SMELL MOTHBALLS.
THINGS ARE LOOKING SO GOOD IN
THE GULF THAT I DON'T WANT TO
HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT THIS PHONY
CRISIS.
HERE TO TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS
PHONY CRISIS, PLEASE WELCOME
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE
DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY AND
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AT TULANE
UNIVERSITY, MICHAEL BLUM.
MICHAEL BLUM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
OIL'S ALL GONE, RIGHT?
>> OIL'S GONE.
>> OIL THAT'S OUT OF SIGHT
DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NO RISK.
>> Stephen: WELK MAYBE, MAYBE,
MAYBE IT WAS A MIRACLE.
MIRACLE'S HAPPEN.
JESUS TURNED WATER INTO WINE.
>> WATER INTO WINE, OIL INTO
WATER.
>> Stephen: MAYBE HE COULD
TURN OIL INTO WATER AND THEN
TURN IT BACK TO WINE AGAIN FOR
MARDI GRAS.
>> WE HAVE OIL THAT DISSOLVES
INTO WATER.
WE STILL HAVE THINGS LIKE
BENZENE AND ARSENIC.
THE CONCERN IS IT WILL BE A
HUMAN HEALTH RISK.
>> Stephen: WE DON'T EAT FISH
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.
WE LAY OFF THE GORTON'S FISH
STICKS AND EVERYTHING IS JIM
CRACKY, RIGHT?
>> WELL, THERE'S MORE FISH
COMING FROM THE GULF THAN ALMOST
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE UNITED
STATES.
40% OF FISHERY'S PRODUCTION
COMES FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO
SOME YOU'RE ASKING A WHOLE
NATION TO STOP EATING FISH.
>> Stephen: WHERE IS YOUR
PROOF OF WHERE THE OIL IS.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE A NERVOUS
NELLIE WHO JUST DOESN'T WANT TO
DRINK BENZENE.
>> I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T WANT TO
DRINK BENZENE.
I THINK MOST FOLKS WOULD FEEL
THE SAME WAY.
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT HOW
DISPERSANTS ACT IN THE
ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY IN
DEPTHS OF THOUSANDS OF METERS.
SO OUR STATE OF UNDERSTANDING OF
THE SPILL LAGS BEHIND SOME OF
THE ANNOUNCEMENTS BEING MADE.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
IF IT'S LEGAL FOR THESE GUYS TO
GET THE SHRIMP AND FOR US TO EAT
THE SHRIMP, AND I WOULD EAT THE
GULF SHRIMP, I'M FAN OF THE
SHRIMPERS, AREN'T THEY GOING TO
MAKE MONEY OFF OF FARMING THE
SHRIMP?
>> CERTAINLY.
>> Stephen: SO SHOULDN'T THEY
GIVE MONEY BACK TO B.P.?
[LAUGHTER]
DIDN'T THEY GET MONEY BASED ON
NOT BEING ABLE TO HARVEST THAT
SHRIMP?
WHO IS THE VICTIM HERE IS WHAT
I'M ASKING?
>> THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES, THE
THAT RICHING COMMUNITIES.
IN THE NEAR TERM SHRIMP BOATS
ARE GOING OUT AND CAPTURING
SHRIMP.
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A
FIVE-YEAR TIME HORIZON WHERE
YIELDS WILL BE DOWN, COMMUNITIES
WILL BE AT RISK AND IN PERIL
BECAUSE LOVES ECONOMIES.
>> Stephen: HOWK -- HOW LONG
SHOULD I CARE.
>> THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION TO
ANSWER.
>> Stephen: BALLPARK MY HEART.
>> YEARS.
>> Stephen: I HAVE THE CARE
ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS?
>> YEARS.
>> Stephen: THERE WILL BE NO
FOOTAGE OF OIL SPEWING FROM THE
BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.
HOW CAN I CARE ABOUT SOMETHING I
CAN'T SEE?
THE OIL IS NOT GOD.
>> BUT IT IS THE ENVIRONMENT.
IT IS PART OF NATURE.
AND THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING
RAISED AND REALLY THE ARC OF THE
EVENT, WE'RE JUST AT THE
BEGINNING OF THIS.
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW
LONG THOSE RISKS ARE OUT THERE.
WE'VE SEEN 100 DAYS PLUS OF OIL
BEING SPILLED INTO THE
ENVIRONMENTMENT WE'RE JUST
PASSING INTO THE PHASE WHERE
WE'RE TRYING TO RECOVER.
>> Stephen: DO YOU LIVE DOWN
THERE?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU EAT
