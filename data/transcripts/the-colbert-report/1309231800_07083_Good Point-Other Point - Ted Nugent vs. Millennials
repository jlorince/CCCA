DON'T TELL HIM THAT PART.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FOLKS, I'M A BIG FAN OF TEA
PARTY DARLING AND '70s ROCK AND
ROLL PARTICIPANT TED NUGENT WHO
LAST WEEK WROTE A POWERFUL
EDITORIAL IN THE "WASHINGTON
TIMES" HEADLINED "MILLENNIALS
SLEEP AS THEIR FUTURE CRUMBLES.
TODAY'S YOUTH SNOOZE WHILE
GOVERNMENT STEALS THEIR FORTUNE
AND LIVES."
YEAH!
NUGENT KNOW IT IS THING THAT'S
GOING TO JOLT OUR YOUTH AWAKE IS
THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SEE, TED REMEMBERS THE
SOCIAL CHANGE OF THE LATE '60s,
THE '68 B.M.C. CONVENTION RIOTS,
PROTESTS OVER THE VIETNAM WAR
AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND HE FINDS
TODAY'S YOUTH BY COMPARISON
"TERMINALLY STONED ON APATHY."
(LAUGHTER)
YES, APATHY!
WHICH IS A GATEWAY DRUG!
STARTS WITH APATHY, IT
EVENTUALLY LEADS TO CRYSTAL MEH.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NOW, NUGENT LONGS FOR THE KIND
OF ACTIVISM HE WITNESSED BACK IN
HIS DAY, MOSTLY FROM AFAR AS HE
EXPLAINS "I WAS EITHER SQUIRREL
HUNTING OR PUTTING A SHARP EDGE
ON MY SONIC GUITAR SLAYING
SKILLS HAVING NOT AWAKENED TO MY
WE THE PEOPLE DUTIES QUITE YET."
WAIT, WHAT THE WHAT?
WE THE PEOPLE DUTIES DON'T
INCLUDE KILLING SWIRLS?
(LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT AS PATRIOTIC AS I
THOUGHT.
NUGENT BELIEVES YOUNG PEOPLE
SHOULD BE OUTRAGED ABOUT OUR
MASSIVE NATIONAL DEBT AND
DECLINING STANDARDS OF LIVING
EXCLAIMING "I AM STUNNED THAT
THEY ARE NOT PARTICIPATING FOR
THE PEA PARTY.
EVEN RIOTING IN THE STREETS,
CLASHING WITH THE COPS,
CONDUCTING SIT-INS AT THEIR
COLLEGES, INTERRUPTING POLITICAL
EVENTS AND SO ON.
I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS
GENERATION, TEXT OR TWITTER THAT
MILLENNIALS."
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, IF THEY WON'T, I WILL.
OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
O.M.G., NUGE OP-ED IS GR 8,
L.O.L., YOU SUCK.
HASHTAG DO WHAT TED NUGENT TELLS
YOU TOW DO.
(LAUGHTER)
SEND.
MIGHT BE MORE THAN 140.
NOT SURE.
BUT, FOLKS, IN THE INTEREST OF
BALANCE I'M GOING GIVE THE
SO-CALLED MILLENNIALS A CHANCE
TO RESPOND TO MR. NUGENT'S
CRITICISM IN A NEW SEGMENT I'M
CALLING "GOOD POINT; OTHER
POINT."
(LAUGHTER)
HERE TO TAKE THE OTHER POINT
POSITION IS N.Y.U. ART HISTORY
MAJOR ROBIN GREENFIELD.
ROBIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
(APPLAUSE)
ROBIN, TED NUGENT HAS CONDEMNED
YOUR GENERATION AS LAZY AND
APATHETIC.
YOUR RESPONSE.
>> WHO'S TED NUGENT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY, WELL... HE... HE MADE A
BUNCH OF HIT RECORDS IN THE
'70s.
>> WHAT'S A RECORD?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: OKAY, IT'S... IT'S
THE WAY WE USED TO BUY MUSIC.
>> BUY MUSIC?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: O.K., UM, ALL RIGHT,
HE'S THE MOTOR CITY MADMAN.
COME ON!
TED NUGENT!
"CAT SCRATCH FEVER!"
BOW HUNTING!
♪ YOU'VE GOT TO WANGO TANGO... ♪
LAUGH
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S... THAT'S FOOD FOR
THOUGHT THERE.
STILL, CLEARLY A POLARIZING
ISSUE, THIS HAS BEEN "GOOD
POINT; OTHER POINT."
THANKS TO ROBIN FOR... SHE'S
GONE.
OKAY.
