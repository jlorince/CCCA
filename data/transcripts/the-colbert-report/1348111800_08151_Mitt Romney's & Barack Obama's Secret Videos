MERELY CATASTROPHIC.

AMERICANS ARE MINDLESS MOOCHER IS AAND ONE THAT ONE OF THEM WAS TENDING BAR AND MOOCHED AN IPHONE.

FOLKS, NOW MY FELLOW CONSERVATIVES HAVE TURNED ON MITT, EVERYBODY FROM BILL KRISTOL TO SCOTT BROWN TO LINDA
McMAHON TO SUSANA MARTINEZ TO PEGGY NOONAN WHO WROTE "IT'S TIME TO ADMIT THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN IS AN INCOMPETENT ONE."

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT NOW -- BUT NOW BUT  WONHE -- AND FOLKS THERE'S A NEW VIDEO THAT STRIKES A CRUSHING BLOW TO THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AND IT'S
EVERYWHERE FROM FOX NEWS TO FOX BUSINESS NEWS.
>> TONIGHT A NEW RECORDING SURFACES, THIS TIME IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO GETS CAUGHT.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NOW DEALING WITH HIS OWN WORDS ON TAPE COMING BACK TO HAUNT HIM.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TURN TO BE HAUNTED BY AN OLD TAPE.
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE BOTH CAMPAIGNS NOW HAVE THESE TAPES BUT YOU MAY NOT HEAR ABOUT THE
OBAMA TAPE ONLY IF YOU ARE WATCHING FOX NEWS TO HEAR THE COUNTER RESPONSE.

LET'S HEAR THE TAPE.
>> THE TRICK IS FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE STRUCTURE GOVERNMENTSOMES THAT POOL RESOURCES AND FAS SILL
TATE SOME REDISTRIBUTION BECAUSE I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN REDISTRIBUTION.

[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE IS HIS VISION YOU PAY TAXES TO A SINGLE FEDERAL AGENCY THAT POOLS IT AND REDISTRIBUTES IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO BUILD
ROADS AND BRIDGES, SOMETIMES IN STATES YOU DON'T LIVE IN.
I BET RONALD RAINAN IS ROLLING OVER IN HIS FEDERALLY MAINTAINED GRAVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S NO TALK OF THIS GOING AWAY BECAUSE UNLIKE MITT'S SECRET VIDEO WHICH WAS MADE WAY  BACK IN MAY, OWE BALMA'S GAFFE
WAS AFTER LABOR DAY 1998.
