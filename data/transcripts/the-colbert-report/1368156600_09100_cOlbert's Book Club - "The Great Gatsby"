REMEMBER THE FIRST RULE OF BOOK
CLUB-- DON'T READ "FIGHT CLUB."
NOW, TONIGHT IN STRICT ADHERENCE
TO BOOK CLUB GUIDELINES, I HAVE
BEEN DRINKING CHARDONNAY SINCE
1:00 P.M.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND OUR INAUGURAL BOOK IS "THE
GREAT GATSBY" BY F. SCOTT
FITZGERALD.
I CHOSE IT IN PART BECAUSE
THERE'S A NEW "GREAT GATSBY"
MANUFACTURE THE SAME WAY WHEN
THE MOVIE "LIFE OF PI" COME OUT,
I READ THE NUMBER PI TO THE
500th DECIMAL.
SPOILER ALERT?
>> SPOILER ALERT-- 2.
AFTER THAT IT GETS KIND OF
REPETITIVE.
BUT, FOLKS, IT'S NOST JUST
BECAUSE THERE'S A MOVIE COMING
OUT.
WE'RE ALSO READING "THE GREAT
GATSBY" BECAUSE IT'S BELIEVE TO
BE A CLASSIC OF AMERICAN
LITERATURE.
THE MODERN LIBRARY CALLS IT ONE
OF THE FIVE NOVELS OF ALM TIME
AND AMAZON REVIEWRL "THE JAKAL,"
GAVE IT THREE OUT OF FIVE STARS,
RATING:  DECENT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SHE'S GOOD.
A LOT OF JACKAL FANS HERE
