IF YOU COULD SEE ME FROM THEWAIST DOWN, I'D BE ARRESTED.
(LAUGHTER)JIMMY, TELL 'EM WHY.
>> WE ARE GETTING BREAKING NEWSLIVE RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE REPORTS THAT MILITARYOPERATIONS IN SYRIA HAVE BEGUN.
>> THE U.S. AND A COALITION OFFIVE ARAB ALLIES LEADING
AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA USINGBOMBERS AND DRONES AND MISSILES.
>> THE ATTACKS DESTROYING ORDAMAGING MULTIPLE TARGETS,
INCLUDING TRAINING COMPOUNDS,HEADQUARTERS, AND COMMAND AND

I.S.I.S. TO DRIVE THEM OUT OFSYRIA AND HAND THAT COUNTRY BACK
TO ITS RIGHTFUL LEADER.
OH, (BLEEP).
RIGHT, THIS GUY, OKAY.
WELL THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONEWHO CAN HOLD THAT REGION
TOGETHER.
ANYONE SEEN SADDAM LATELY?
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT...
THE SPIDER HOLE AND THE BEARDAND THE --
(POP NOISE)WELL, LIVE AND LEARN.
THAT'S ONE ON US.
POINT IS, SYRIA IS A COUNTRYWE'VE NEVER BOMBED BEFORE --
WHICH MEANS I GET TO PUT A NEWHOLE IN MY MIDEAST FREQUENT
BOMBING CARD!
(PUNCH CARD)WE'VE ALREADY BOMBED
AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, PAKISTAN,YEMEN, SOMALIA AND LIBYA.
NOW SYRIA.
(PUNCH)ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BOMB OMAN,
AND I GET A FREE FALAFEL!
OF COURSE, AS MUCH AS I LOVETURNING A NEW CORNER OF THE
DESERT INTO THE BOOM BOOM ROOM,THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
STORY THAT MAKES ME WONDER IF WERUSHED INTO BATTLE TOO FAST,
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT -- THENETWORK GRAPHICS PACKAGES
WERE JUST NOT READY.
COME ON!
WE'RE DROPPING BOMBS ON SYRIAAND THE "TODAY SHOW" IS USING
THE SAME LOWER-THIRD GRAPHICTHEY USED TO REPORT THAT 50 CENT
CAN'T THROW A BASEBALL?!
AMERICA IS AT WAR, IT IS THESWORN DUTY OF THE NEWS BIZ TO
CALL ON THE BEST AND THEBRIGHTEST IN OUR GRAPHICS
DEPARTMENTS TO SERVE THEIRNATION.
JIMMY, LET'S LOCK AND LOAD!
>> STEPHEN, IT'S NOT DONE.
THE SOUND'S NOT ON IT YET.
>> STEPHEN: JIMMY, YOU GO TOWAR WITH THE GRAPHICS YOU HAVE,
NOT THE GRAPHICS YOU WANT.
I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE SOUND.
JUICE IT!
(STEPHEN MAKES MUSIC ANDEXPLOSIONS WITH HIS MOUTH)
"AIRSTRIKES ON TERROR:  SYRIA'SBUSINESS:  SHOVE IT UP THEIR
I.S.I.L.! BOOM!"(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S NOT JUST AMERICA AND THEARABS DROPPING THE BOMBS.
OUR CLOSEST ALLY, FRANCE, ISBATTLING I.S.I.S. WITH SOMETHING
MORE POWERFUL, NAME CALLING.
THEY'VE DITCHED I.S.I.S.,I.S.I.L. AND THE ISLAMIC STATE
AND ARE NOW CALLING THE GROUPDAISH.
AS IN, "THESE GUYS ARE A BUNCHOF DAISH-BAGS".
THE NAME DAISH COMES FROM THEARAB
ACRONYM FOR "ISLAMIC STATE OFIRAQ AND THE LEVANT," AL-DAWLA
AL-ISLAMIYA FI AL-IRAQ WAAL-SHAM
WHICH JUST PROVES THE OLD SAYING"STICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK MY
BONES, BUT I CAN'T PRONOUNCETHAT NAME."
AND FRANCE IS CALLING THEM"DAISH" BECAUSE "THE GROUP IS
REPORTED TO HATE THE MONIKER."
SO MUCH THAT "THEY WERETHREATENING TO CUT OUT THE
TONGUES OF ANYONE WHO USED THEPHRASE PUBLICLY."
OOOOH!
SEE ME SHAKE, DAISH?
YOU ARE GOING DOWN!
OR MY NAME'S NOT JIMMY FALLON!WRITE IT DOWN.
