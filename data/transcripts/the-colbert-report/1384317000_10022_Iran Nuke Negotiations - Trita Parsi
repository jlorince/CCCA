(LAUGHTER)AND NOW THAT FRANCE HAS SAVED
THE WORLD, WE MUST NEVER, EVERGO BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
WITH IRAN.
HERE TO TELL ME WHY WE MUST GOBACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
WITH IRAN IS THE PRESIDENT OFTHE NATIONAL IRANIAN AMERICAN
COUNCIL TRITA PARSI.
MR. PARSI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORCOMING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANKS SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
SIR, YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF "ASINGLE ROLL OF THE DICE."
ABOUT WHY AMERICA MUST GET BACKTO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH
IRAN.
BUT WHY, SIR, HAVEN'T WE DODGEDA BULLET BY WALKING AWAY FROM
THE POWER-MAD MULLAHS WHO WANTTO BOMB ISRAEL AND WIPE IT OFF
THE MAP?
>> ACTUALLY, WHAT PRESIDENTOBAMA WAS DOING IN THESE
NEGOTIATIONS WAS A HUGE FAVOR TOISRAEL BECAUSE IF THE DEAL HAD
GONE THROUGH, IF THE FRENCH HADNOT CHANGED TO GO FORTH IN THE
LAST MINUTE THERE WOULD BE ACLOSING OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
THE IRANIANS TO BUILD A NUCLEARWEAPON AND THAT WOULD HELP
ISRAEL'S SECURITY AND MANY OTHERPEOPLE'S SECURITY AND MOST
IMPORTANTLY AMERICA'S SECURITY.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO CALLBULL (BLEEP) ON YOU TWO WAYS
HERE.
(LAUGHTER)FIRST OF ALL, THE FRENCH CAN'T
MOVE GOALPOSTS, THEY DON'T PLAYFOOTBALL.
THEY PLAY WHAT THEY CALL F,TBOL.
ANYWAYS, THE SECOND SOMETHINGHOW ARE WE HELPING ISRAEL?
HOW ARE WE STOPPING IRAN FROMGETTING A BOMB BECAUSE ALL
QUESTION IS IS FOR A REDUCTIONIN THEIR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES.
IN EXCHANGE WE GIVE THEM SIXMONTHS OF CASH, SELL THEIR OIL,
UNFREEZE THEIR ACCOUNTS.
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW THEY SAY,HEY, THANKS FOR THE CASH WE'RE
GOING TO GO BACK TO BUILDING OURBOMB.
ISRAEL, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, THEYGET TO BLAME US.
>> NOT AT ALL.
HERE'S WHY YOU'RE WRONG.
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY YES.
(LAUGHTER)>> HERE'S WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANINTERIM DEAL IN ORDER TO REACH A
LATER DEAL WHEN THE FINALAGREEMENT WERE TO BE NEGOTIATED.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT THAT'STRUSTING ROUHANI, RIGHT?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S TRUSTING?
IT'S TRUSTING THE AGREEMENT.
THE AGREEMENT THAT VERIFY IT ISOTHER SIDE IS NOT CHEATING.
IT'S NOT ABOUT TRUSTING THEOTHER SIDE OF THIS ONE.
MORE IMPORTANTLY -->> Stephen: HOW CAN WE TRUST
ANY AGREEMENT WITH THESE PEOPLE.
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN RELEASED THEHOSTAGES YET.
IT'S DAY 12,428.
LET BEN AFFLECK GO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THE SANCTIONS ARE WORKING.
THE POINT IS THE SANCTIONS AREWORKING AREN'T THEY?
>> I WOULD SAY NO, THE SANCTIONSARE WORKING IN THE SENSE OF
DESTROYING THE ECONOMY OF THEIRANIANS.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY WOULDN'TBE COMING TO THE BARGAINING
TABLE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESANCTIONS!
>> THIS WAS THE SAME TEAM THATIN 2005 OFFERED TO CAP THE
NUCLEAR PROGRAM AT 3,000CENTRIFUGES.
TODAY THEY HAVE 19,000.
WHAT THE DEAL WOULD HAVEACHIEVED IS REMARKABLE BECAUSE
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME INEIGHT YEARS THAT THE PROGRAM--
ESSENTIAL PARTS OF IT-- WOULDHAVE BEEN FROZEN.
THAT'S CRITICAL.
>> Stephen: ARE THE SANCTIONSHURTING THEM?
>> THEY ARE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOUWANT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACARROT-AND-STICK APPROACH.
YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, SAY WE'LLSTOP HITTING YOU WITH THE STOCK
AND WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT ITYOU STAB THEM WITH THE CARROT!
(LAUGHTER)SO -- BUT THEY WANT A BOMB,
RIGHT?
WE KNOW THEY WANT A BOMB.
>> ACTUALLY, U.S. INTELLIGENCEIS SAYING THAT THEY ARE
PREPARING TO PUT EVERYTHINGTOGETHER IN ORDER TO HAVE THE
OPTION OF BUILDING A BOMB.
BUT THEY HAVE NOT MADE ADECISION TO GO THERE TO BUILD A
BOMB AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WECAN DO AND A LOT THAT THIS DEAL
WOULD HAVE DONE TO MAKE SURETHAT THAT OPTION ALSO WOULD HAVE
BEEN ELIMINATED.
UNTIL THE FRENCH SHOWED UP.
>> Stephen: OKAY, NOW LISTEN.
YOU ARE IRANIAN OR AN AMERICANCITIZEN.
>> I WAS BORN IN IRAN, I'M ASWEDISH CITIZEN.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A SWEDISHCITIZEN.
WELL, I DON'T TRUST THOSEBASTARDS, EITHER.
(LAUGHTER)SO YOU'RE NOT AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.
>> I'M A GREEN CARD HOLDER.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I'VE SEEN"HOMELAND."
SPOILER ALERT: THERE'S NO REASONTO TRUST YOU.
>> YOU QUESTION LOYALTY AT THESAME TIME YOU'RE PRAISE THE
FRENCH WHEN THEY'RE CELEBRATINGA SETBACK IN AMERICAN FOREIGN
POLICY.
>> NO, THEY'RE HOLDING THE LINEAGAINST THE MULLAHS -- ANYONE
WHOSE FLAG HAS RED WHITE ANDBLUE ON IT, MY FRIEND.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
TRITA PARSI, THE NATIONALIRANIAN AMERICAN COUNCIL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
