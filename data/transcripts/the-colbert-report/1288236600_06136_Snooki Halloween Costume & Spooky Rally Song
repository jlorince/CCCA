NATION, NATION, I HAVE SOME
NEWS.
IT IS OFFICIAL.
YESTERDAY, OCTOBER 26,
JOURNALISM DIED.
IN THE END IT WASN'T THE
INTERNET THAT KILLED IT.
IT WAS A "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
COVER STORY FEATURING A DRAWING
OF SNOOKI.
I DIDN'T EVEN REALLY RECOGNIZE
HER UNTIL I FILLED IN HER FACE
WITH AN ORANGE HIGHLIGHTER.
( APPLAUSE )
I DON'T EVEN WATCH THE SHOW.
NOW, MISS SNOOKI WAS HERE
BECAUSE THE "JOURNAL" RAN A
PIECE ABOUT THE SEASON'S MOST
POPULAR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES WITH
"JERSEY SHORE" CHARACTERS
TOPPING THE.
I ALWAYS GET ALL MY COSTUME
IDEAS FROM THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL."
LAUGHTER
LAST YEAR I WENT AS BEN
BERNANKE.
TERRIFYING.
TERRIFYING.
( APPLAUSE )
I LEFT A FLAMING BAG OF POOP ON
ALAN GREENSPAN'S DOORSTEP.
NOW, DON'T FORGET, DON'T FORGET,
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A COSTUME
FOR MY RALLY THIS SATURDAY ON
THE WASHINGTON MALL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AS ALWAYS... AS ALWAYS, FOLKS,
MY RALLY COVERAGE IS, OF COURSE,
SPONSORED BY REESE'S PEANUT
BUTTER CUPS.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYONE
WHO WAS STARTLED BY MY
SUGGESTION THAT REESES WERE MADE
FROM BITS OF REESE WITHSPOON OR
DELLA REESE.
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED IN NO
UNCERTAIN TERMS BY REESE'S
LAWYERS THAT NEITHER ACTRESS IS
AN INGREDIENT.
REESE'S ARE IN FACT MADE FROM
RHESUS MONKEYS.
HEY, IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT
THEY PUT IN KIT KATS.
I KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT MY
UPCOMING MARCH BECAUSE YOU HEROS
HAVE BEEN DONATING IN DLOAFS TO
DONORSCHOOSE.ORG.
SO FAR YOU, THE HEROES, HAVE
DONATED $469,112 AND HELPED OVER
174,000 KIDS!
AND TO SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE, TO
SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE, THESE KIDS
HAVE BEEN SENDING ME DRAWINGS OF
THEIR GREATEST FEARS.
( LAUGHTER )
SEE.
THIS ONE IS A ACTUAL DRAWING.
THIS IS FROM JACQUELINE, AGE
SEVEN.
SHE'S FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA.
AND HER GREATEST FEAR IS OF
PUMPKINS EVOLVING INTO MONSTERS.
DON'T WORRY, JACQUELINE.
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN BECAUSE
EVOLUTION DOESN'T EXIST.
OKAY?
PUMPKIN MONSTERS ARE JUST PART
OF GOD'S INTELLIGENT PUMPKIN
DESIGN.
( LAUGHTER )
AND CAITLIN, CAITLIN FROM
TOLEDO, OHIO, HAS DRAWN HER
GREATEST FEAR, WHICH IS STAGE
FRIGHT.
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE "HA HAS"
HERE, SHE'S AFRAID EVERYONE WILL
LAUGH AT HER.
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S ONE THING I
HADN'T THOUGHT TO BE AFRAID OF.
I'M GETTING ON STAGE IN FROM THE
OF 100,000 PEOPLE.
WHAT IF THEY LAUGH?
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?
( LAUGHTER )
STOP IT!
CAITLIN, WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY.
IF I'M GOING TO BE THIS SCARED
AT THE RALLY, SO SHOULD BY ARCH
FRENEMY, JON STEWART.
SO RIGHT NOW, EVERYBODY, I WANT
TO TEACH YOU IN HERE AND OUT
THERE A SPOOKY SONG THAT WE'LL
ALL SING TOGETHER AT THE RALLY
TO MAKE HIM DROP A LOAD OF
REASON IN HIS PANTS.
JIMMY, LET'S SPOOK IT UP.
SPOOK IT UP.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY.
ON THREE FOLLOW THE BOUNCING
SKULL.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

SKIN ON ♪♪
