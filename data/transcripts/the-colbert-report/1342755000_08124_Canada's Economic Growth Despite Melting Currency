>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU KNOW, NO MATTER
HOW LOW OUR ECONOMY HAS SUNK,
AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO CONSOLE ITSELF WITH ONE
SIMPLE TRUTH, AT LEAST WE'RE
NOT CANADA.
WITH THEIR PELT-BASED
ECONOMY, CANADA HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THE PLAIN SISTER WHO
MAKES US FEEL SEXY.
THAT'S WHY I WAS CRUSHED TO
LEARN THIS.
>> OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE
NORTH, GET READY FOR THIS,
BECAUSE WE'RE COMING DOWN A
NOTCH IN THIS COUNTRY, OUR
CANADIAN FRIENDS ARE NOW
RICHER THAN WE ARE.
>> NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS FOR
THE FIRST TIME CANADIANS
HAVE A HIGHER AVERAGE NET
WORTH THAN AMERICANS.
>> CANADIANS ARE WORTH MORE
THAN AMERICANS!
FOR PETE'S SAKES.
THEY'VE GOT DUCKS ON THEIR
MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
APPARENTLY THE NET WORTH OF
THE AVERAGE CANADIAN
HOUSEHOLD IN 200-- 2011 WAS
$363,202 DOLLARS WHILE THE
AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD
NET WORTH WAS $319,907.
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF-- I
DON'T KNOW BECAUSE AMERICANS
CAN'T DO MATH.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE CANADIANS DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO GLOAT ABOUT IT.
CANADIAN COLUMNIST DOUG
HADDOW SAID QUOTE EF RELING
IN AMERICA'S FALL FROM THE
TOP IS ULTIMATELY
UNCANADIAN.
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BEGIN TO
SUSPECT THAT WE'RE NOT
ACTUALLY WINNING, WE'RE JUST
LOSING MORE SLOWLY.
HA.
SUCK IT, SLOWPOKES.
WE'RE WINNING AT LOSING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT, HERE'S THEIR
MONEY.
HERE'S THEIR MONEY.
WE DON'T NEED YOUR PITTY.
YOU MAY HAVE MORE OF YOUR
FANCY SEA THROUGH POLLY MER
PLAY MONEY NOW BUT IT'S TO
THE GOING TO LAST.
>> WHILE THE CANADIAN
ECONOMY IS DOING PRETTY WELL,
IT'S NEW 50 AND $100 BILLS
APPEAR TO BE MELTING.
THE NEW BILLS ARE MADE FROM
A POLYMER THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE INDESTRUCTABLE.
TURNS OUT THE BILLS CAN MELT
IF LEFT IN CARS ON A HOT
SUMMER DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: LEAVE IT TO THE
CANUCKS TO TURN A CURRENCY
THAT WORKS ONLY IN ICE RINKS.
CANADA, HAVE YOU LEARNED
NOTHING FROM THE STORY OF
HANUKKAH WHEN THE MACCABEES
FENDED OFF THEIR GREEK
OPPRESSERS ONLY TO HAVE THE
DESERT HEAT DESTROY THEIR
TREASURY OF CHOCOLATE COINS?
THIS JUST PROVES-- THIS JUST
PROVES WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS
SUSPECTED, CANADA.
CELSIUS DOES NOT WORK.
YOUR WATER BOILS AT 100
DEGREES.
OURS CAN GET ALL THE WAY UP
TO 212.
THAT'S WHY OUR MONEY IS
TOUGHER.
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU ENJOY
THAT GLOBAL WARMING,
