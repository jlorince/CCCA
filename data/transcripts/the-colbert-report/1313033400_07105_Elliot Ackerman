[LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME ELLIOT ACKERMAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
SIT DOWN.
YOU ARE A CHIEF OPERATIONS
OFFICER FOR AMERICANSELECT.ORG.
BEFORE THAT YOU SPENT EIGHT
YEARS IN THE MARINES, MULTIPLE
TOWERS OF DUTY IN IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTAN, PURPLE STAR, BRONZE
STAR, DID YOU GET AN EMMY?
I'M IN THE SAYING THAT STUFF IS

HOW DO YOU PICK A PRESIDENT OVER
THE INTERNET?
>> WELL, IT'S A SIMPLE VISION IN
THAT THE VISION HERE SON
NOVEMBER 6, 2012 WHEN PEOPLE GO
TO THE POLLS FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVER THERE WILL BE A THIRD
TICKET THAT THEY'VE DIRECTLY
NOMINATED.
>> STEPHEN: A THIRD PARTY?
>> A TICKET.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TICKET AND
A PARTY?
>> WE'RE NOT A PARTY.
PARTIES HAVE SPECIAL INTERESTS.
THEY HAVE AGENDAS.
WE'RE A SECOND WAY TO PICK A
PRESIDENT, ONE THAT IS BIGGER
THAN THE PARTIES AND PUTS PEOPLE
AHEAD OF THE PARTIES.
>> STEPHEN: BIGGER THAN THE
PARTIES?
HOW SO?
HOW MUCH CASH DO YOU HAVE?

TO BE NONPARTISAN.

THEY KNOW WHAT REPUBLICANS STAND
FOR WHICH IS AMERICA AND THEN
YOU CAN DECIDE WHICH ONE YOU
WANT TO SUPPORT.

POLITICS.

>> STEPHEN: DOES THAT NOT MEAN
MONEY?
THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED
MONEY EQUALS SPEECH.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE A SUPERPAC WHICH HAS
UNLIMITED CASH IT CAN GIVE OUT.
WILL YOU TAKE MONEY FROM A PAC?
>> ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS WE'VE
SEEN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL
MEDIA IT'S OPENED UP ALL FACETS
OF LIFE.
POLITICS IS ONE OF FEW PLACES
WHERE YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT BRAND A
AND BRAND B.
AMERICANS ARE GIVING INDIVIDUALS
POWERS AND TOOLS TO DRAFT THEIR
OWN CANDIDATES.
HELP DEVELOP A PLATTFORM THAT
THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO ANSWER
AND BE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND
DEBATE THE RULES OF CONVENTION
THAT EVERY DELEGATE GETS TO VOTE
IN.
NOT JUST THE FOLKS IN IOWA,
NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA.

NO, YOU DON'T WANT MY MONEY.

SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS,
INTEREST ORGANIZATIONS OR PACS.

EACH OTHER'S BEAKS WET ON THIS
ONE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU HAVE TO WEIGH -- HOW TO YOU
MATCH UP, PEOPLE FILL OUT A
QUESTIONNAIRE.
WHEN YOU SIGN UP, WHAT HAPPENS?
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS DO
YOU IS COME TO THE WEB SITE AND
SIGN UP AS A DELEGATE IT'S NOT A
PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESS.
WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE WHAT ARE THE
CRUCIAL ISSUES, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS IMPORTANT?
YOU WEIGH THE ISSUES, THE
CANDIDATES WEIGH THE ISSUES IT'S
A DEBATE NOT ABOUT RED OR BLUE
BUT ABOUT THE CRUCIAL ISSUES
FACING THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: I FILL OUT A
QUESTIONNAIRE.
DOT CANDIDATES FILL OUT A
QUESTIONNAIRE?
>> THEY'LL COME ONLINE AND DO
THE SAME THING.
>> STEPHEN: DO WE GET MATCHED
UP?
IS IT LIKE CHEMISTRY.COM?
OR E- HARMONY NOT COME OF THE
ELECTION?
>> IT'S A MUCH MORE INTERACTIVE
PROCESS.
>> STEPHEN: YOU SAY YOU DON'T
IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH
CAROLINA ELECTINGING THE NEXT
PRESIDENT.
I AM FROM SOUTH CAROLINA I TAKE
OFFENSE TO THAT.
I BELIEVE IN THE GOOD PEOPLE OF
IOWA.
NEW HAMPSHIRE --
[LAUGHTER]
WHY DON'T YOU WANT THEM SAYING
WHO THE NOMINEES ARE?
>> WE WANT TO LEVERAGE OUR
-- WE WANT EVERYBODY TO GET
INVOLVED
>> WE WANT TO LEVERAGE OUR
NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES TO GET US
BACK TO SOME OF OUR OLDEST
VALUES WHICH IS LETTING EVERY
VOTER PARTICIPATE IN A
MEANINGFUL WAY IN A PRIMARY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ARE YOU ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50
STATES?
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE
BALLOT IN 50.
>> STEPHEN: EVERY STATE YOU
HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PETITION
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
>> WE DO.
>> EVERY STATE HAS DIFFERENT
BALLOT ACCESS LAWS.
WE'RE JUMPING OVER THE HURDLES
AS THEY COME.
WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS.
OF THE 2.9 MILLION SIGNATURES WE
NEED WE GATHERED TWO MILLION AND
WE SUBMITTED 1.6 MILLION IN
CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL MAKES IT
THE LARGEST PETITION GATHERING
IN THE HISTORY AFTER THIS STATE
AND WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE
HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN: IF YOU GET TO 2.9
YOU GET IN ALL 50 STATES?
>> ALL 50 STATES.
DO YOU HAVE TO GET THEM IN EVERY
OR CAN YOU GET 2.9 ANYWHERE?
>> YOU HAVE TO GO STATE BY STATE
AND GET THEM.
IT'S A POLITICAL INNOVATION.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT
BALLOT ACCESS WILL HAVE BEEN
ACHIEVED FOR A CANDIDATE TO BE
DIRECTLY NOMINATED BY THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED,
COME TO AMERICANSELECT.ORG

ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.
LET'S DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND GET
OUR POLITICS ON TRACK.
>> STEPHEN: LAST QUESTION AND
MOST IMPORTANT:  WHAT POLITICAL
PARTY ARE YOU SECRETLY BACKING?
[LAUGHTER]
>> NONE, STEPHEN, WE'RE PUTTING
UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO PEOPLE
CAN COME.
>> STEPHEN: GOOD LUCK
