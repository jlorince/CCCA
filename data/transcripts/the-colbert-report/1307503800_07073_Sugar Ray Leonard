(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
VERY FIRST BOXER TO EARN MORE
THAN $100 MILLION IN PURSES.
PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE ASKED
FOR CASH.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME SUGAR RAY
LEONARD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MR. LEONARD, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
MY GOODNESS, MY GOODNESS, LET'S
JUST LAY IT OUT FOR THE PEOPLE.
LET'S JUST... FIRST OF ALL, DING
DING.
BUT SECOND OF ALL LET'S LAY IT
OUT FOR THE PEOPLE.
YOU, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST,
BOXING TITLES IN FIVE DIFFERENT
WEIGHT CLASSES.
YOU DEFEATED ROBERTO DURAN,
THOMAS HEARNS, MARVELOUS MARVIN
HAGGLER.
YOU HAVE A NEW MEMOIR "SUGAR RAY
LEONARD, THE BIG FIGHT, MY LIFE
IN AND OUT OF THE RING."
DO YOU MISS THE RING, SIR?
>> I DON'T MISS GETTING HIT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: THE KEY IS TO NOT
GET HIT.
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THAT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> YOU KNOW, STEPHEN, I MISS THE
CAMARADERIE, I MISS TRAINING
CAMP.
I MISS CHOREOGRAPHING THE FIGHT
IN MY HEAD.
I MISS ALL THAT ACTION.
>> Stephen: CHOREOGRAPH, DO
YOU TAP DANCE, LIKE ALL
AMERICANS DO?
>> YES.
A LITTLE BIT.
>> Stephen: A LITTLE BIT?
>> Stephen: HEEL BALL
CHANGE... WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?
KICK BALL CHANGE?
>> THAT'S AS FAR AS I GOT.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU REALLY
CAME TO PROMINENCE IN THE 1976
MONTREAL GAMES AND THAT'S WHEN I
BECAME A HUGE FAN.
YOU WERE THE BIG STAR OF THOSE
GAMES.
YOU GO IN THERE, SET YOUR MAN UP
AND THEN YOU HIT HIM WITH THIS
ABSOLUTE FLURRY.
YOU FACE STRAIGHT ON TO THE GUY
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HIT HIM 50
TIMES IN THREE SECONDS AND THEY
WILL TURN TO GUAVA JELLY IN
FRONT OF YOU.
WAS THERE A NAME FOR THAT FLURRY
YOU DID?
>> WE CALL IT FLURRIES.
>> Stephen: FLURRIES?
>> YEAH, LITTLE FLURRIES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE STUFF WAS
HAPPENING INSIDE THEIR SAID?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IT WAS LIKE A SNOW
GLOBE, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO
THEIR BRAIN INSIDE.
>> I DIDN'T TRY TO HURT THEM BUT
I TRY TO KEEP THEM OFF BALANCE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: NOW YOU GOT
PUNCHED IN THE HEAD A LOT?
>> NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, ENOUGH BUT... YOU'RE
STILL GOOD LOOKING, MAN.
YOU DIDN'T MESS IT UP TOO MUCH.
>> MAKE UP.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: REALLY?
REALLY?
ME, TOO.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SAY IN THE BOOK YOU WERE A
MASTER IN THE RING, YOU WEREN'T
ALWAYS A MASTER IN YOUR LIFE.
YOU... YOU DID SOME THINGS THAT
YOU REGRET.
DID YOU EVER TWEET PICTURES OF
YOUR JUNK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THERE WAS NO TWEETING BACK
THEN.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YOU DODGED A
BULLET.
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS
YOU HAD IN YOUR REAL LIFE THAT
COULDN'T BE SOLVED BY PUNCHING
IT IN THE HEAD.
>> I THINK IT WAS INFIDELITY.
>> Stephen: OH, YEAH.
NO, WE CAN SAY THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WAS THERE A LOT
BEING OFFERED TO THE WORLD
CHAMPION?
>> YOU MEAN...
>> Stephen: YEAH, THE LADIES.
(LAUGHTER).
>> IT WAS UNAUTHORIZED.
>> Stephen: IT WAS
UNAUTHORIZED?
INFIDELITY USUALLY IS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU HAD CHARM AND STYLE.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S MISSING FROM
BOXING RIGHT NOW?
BECAUSE YOU COULD ELECTRIFY A
ROOM.
MY MOTHER-- VERY SWEET LADY--
SHE... WE... SHE AND I WOULD
WATCH YOU FIGHT.
AND THIS IS A VERY NICE WOMAN,
ELEVEN KIDS, WOULDN'T HURT A
FLEA BUT SHE WOULD WATCH YOU
FIGHT AND GO "I KNOW, IT'S
TERRIBLE, I KNOW BOTH OF THOSE
MEN IN THAT RING ARE SOMEBODY
REESE BABY, I KNOW IT'S A BLOOD
SPORT BUT GOD I LOVE IT SO
MUCH."
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, I TRIED TO BE ARTISTIC.
I TRIED TO I SAW YOU TAP DANCE.
>> Stephen: KICK BALL CHANGE.
>> BUT IT WAS ALL CHOREOGRAPHED.
IT WAS ALL MOVEMENT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING
BOXING IS FAKE?
>> NO, NO, NO.
NO, IT'S REAL, VERY REAL.
BUT IN MY HEAD I WAS ABLE TO
MAKE THE GUYS DO WHAT I WANTED
THEM TO DO.
>> Stephen: COULD YOU... WHO
COULD YOU TAKE NOW?
MANNY PACAOU, YOU IN 1987,
AGAINST TODAY'S MANNY.
>> DONE, FINISHED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU NOW AGAINST A 1987 MANNY
PACAOU.
HE'S LIKE FOUR YEARS OLD, I
THINK.
STILL TOUGH, THOUGH, COULD YOU
TAKE HIM?
>> WIPE HIM OUT.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> YOU FOUGHT AND DEFEATED FLOYD
MAYWEATHER, CORRECT?
>> WELL, HIS FATHER, I KNOCKED
HIM OUT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, YOU KNOCKED
OUT FLOYD MAYWEATHER.
>> HIS FATHER.
>> Stephen: HIS SON IS
FIGHTING TODAY.
COULD YOU TAKE HIM?
BECAUSE IF YOU BEAT THE DAD
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO BEAT
THE SON.
>> LIKE FATHER LIKE SON.
SAME THING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF BOXING TODAY?
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY WATCHED
MUCH BOXING SINCE IT ALL WENT
PAY-PER-VIEW.
IT USED TO BE YOU WOULD CASUALLY
KIND OF CATCH A BOXING MATCH.
YOU COULD CATCH A CHAMPIONSHIP
MATCH ACCIDENTALLY AS YOU'RE
FLIPPING BY STATIONS.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE
DECISION TO PUT DOWN THE MONEY
TO WATCH PEOPLE BRUTALIZE EACH
OTHER.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT BEFORE YOU JUST GET SUCKED
INTO THE SWEET SCIENCE AND THE
NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE
PUNCHING YOUR BROTHER IN THE
FACE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> IT'S DIFFERENT.
CHAMPIONS DON'T FIND CHAMPIONS
ANYMORE.
AND THEY'RE NOT AS MANY
PERSONALITIES AND CHARACTERS AND
CHAMPIONS.
AND THERE'S SO MANY
SELF-GOVERNING BODIES.
WBA, WBC, IBU, YOU BE ME.
ALL THESE BODIES.
AND THE AMATEUR PROGRAMMING HAS
REALLY GONE DOWN BECAUSE BACK IN
THE DAY GOLDEN GLOVES WAS A HUGE
EVENT.
THE OLYMPICS WAS HUGE AND NOW
IT'S NOT SHOWN AS MUCH.
BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE
BASICS.
START AMATEUR COMPETITION
STRONG.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT
ULTIMATE FIGHTING?
YOU LIKE THAT?
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO GET IN THAT
RING AND WRESTLE A 400-POUND
WHITE SUPREMACIST AND...
(LAUGHTER).
ELBOW HIM IN THE NUTS?
BECAUSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: I COULD BE
MOTIVATED.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD BE
MOTIVATED?
>> I COULD BE MOTIVATED.
>> Stephen: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS BUT I'M GOING TO
THROW DOWN THE GLOVE RIGHT NOW.
WILL YOU THUMB WRESTLE ME?
>> YES.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> ALL RIGHT, OH, YEAH.
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND I'M A
FIGHTER.
I'M A REAL FIGHTER.
>> Stephen: OH, YOU UNDERSTAND
I HAVE EIGHT BROTHERS.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT?
ONE, TWO, THREE FOUR...
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE ALREADY, WHAT, NO?
LOOK HOW LONG THAT THUMB IS!
6-
>> TWO ROUNDS?
THREE ROUNDS.
>> Stephen: OH!
OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, I
DECLARE A THUMB WAR.
ALL RIGHT, GO.
(LAUGHTER)
YES!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I BEAT WORLD CHAMPION SUGAR RAY
LEONARD!
THE BOOK IS "THE BIG FIGHT."
GET IT!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
