>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
ONCE AGAIN, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, MICHELLE OBAMA IS JOINED BY NIRS GHENTALMAN OF
COAL BAR NATION, ME.
AS I SAID BEFORE AND THE AUDIENCE KNOWS THIS, YOU'RE THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen:  WHY DID YOU TAKE ON THIS ISSUE OF AMERICANS HELPING OUT MILITARY FAMILIES?
FIRST LADIES CAN PICK THEIR OWN AGENDA.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  LADY BYRD JOHNSON WAS BEAUTIFYING OUR NATION.
HILLARY CLINTON WAS OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
NANCY REAGAN WAS JUST NO SAYING.
WHY DOES THIS AND CHILDHOOD OBESITY THE TWO THINGS THAT APPEAL TO YOU.
>> WHEN I WAS CAMPAIGNING, I GOT TO MEET THESE MILITARY FAMILY.
I WAS TRAVELING AROUND, TALKING TO MOSTLY SPOUSES AND, YOU KNOW,
I WAS AWED BY THEIR SACRIFICE.
I MEAN, THESE FOLKS ARE-- YOU KNOW, YOU CITED SOME OF THE STATISTICS.
THEY ARE MOVING MORE OFTEN THAN ANY AVERAGE AMERICAN DOES.
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SOMETIMES,
YOU KNOW, THEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO SCHOOLS, CHANGING SCHOOLS NIEB, 10 TIMES IN THEIR
ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL CAREER.
BUT THE THING THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT THEY DO IT WITH GRACE.
THEY DO IT WITHOUT COMPLAINT.
AND I WAS INSPIRED.
I SAID ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE, THAT I WOULD
TRY TO BE THEIR VOICE AND TELL THEIR STORIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT MOST AMERICANS ARE LIKE ME
AND LIKE YOU, WE ARE NOT A PART OF THE MILITARY COMMUNITY, SO WE
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SACRIFICE.
>> Stephen:  WELL, I DID-- I DID-- I DID SERVE IN IRAQ FOR ALMOST A WEEK
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALMOST A WEEK.
( APPLAUSE ) SO I CONSIDER MYSELF A VETERAN.
>> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  WHICH IS WHY I HIRED MYSELF FOR THIS SHOW.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
AND YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
GREAT HIRE.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU ARE POPULAR.
( APPLAUSE ) YOU ARE--
( CHEERS ) DO YOU EVER LORD OVER THE
PRESIDENT THE IN FACT THAT YOU'RE MORE POPULAR THAN HE IS?
DO YOU EVER SAY, "WATCH IT, OR I MIGHT NOT CAMPAIGN FOR YOU?"
>> I MIGHT TRY THAT WHEN I GET HOME.
>> Stephen:  HAVE YOU ENDORSED HIM YET?
ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO THAT?
>> I AM PREPARED.
I'M ENDORSING MY HUSBAND, BARACK OBAMA.
I THINK HE WILL BE A PHENOMENAL PRESIDENT.
HE HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB.
HE'S MY MAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  GOOD LUCK, GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK WITH THE ELECTION.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU'RE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT--
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  I FEEL FAIRLY COMFORT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS WATCHING THIS BROADCAST RIGHT NOW.
>> PROBABLY.
>> Stephen:  I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT WATCHING RIGHT NOW.
( LAUGHTER ) OKAY.
HE SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING IT.
HE SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THIS INTERVIEW VERY MUCH.
>> HE IS CONCERNED.
HE IS DEEPLY CONCERNED.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS A WELL-EXPRESSED OPINION.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
>> I CAN SEE IT.
>> Stephen:  BUT WE HAVE A RESIDENT EXPERT PUNDIT HERE AT THE STEPHEN COLBERT.
BRIAN, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE?
>> NOT IN THIS ECONOMY.
