>> Stephen: TONIGHT THE
LATEST ON LAST WEEK'S IOWA
STRAW POLL.
IT IS NOW AN EMPTY DIRT
FIELD FULL OF RACCOONS.
THEN ANDERSON COOPER LOSES
HIS COMPOSURE, IT'S THE
WORSE JOURNALISTIC GAFFE
SINCE WALTER CRONKITE
COVERED THE MOON LANDING
TOPLESS.
AND MY GUEST IS KEVIN
MITNICK.
I'LL ASK HIM HOW TO SET UP
MY GODDAMN WIRELESS PRINTER.
IT'S MY LAST BLOG CAST FOR
TWO WEEKS-- BROADCAST FOR
TWO WEEKS BUT I PROMISE TO
GIVE YOU ONE LAST GREAT SHOW
BEFORE I GO.
