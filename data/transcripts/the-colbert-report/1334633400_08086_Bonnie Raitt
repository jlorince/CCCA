(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVE GUITARISTS OF ALL TIME.
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EASY PLAYING GUITAR WHEN YOU'RE GOING DOWN A SLIDE.
PLEASE WELCOME BONNIE RAITT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BONNIE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE.
>> EVERYONE'S SO EXCITED TO HAVE YOU HERE.
>> YOU MAKE OUR LIVES WORTHWHILE STEPHEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I SHOUT THAT INTO A MIRROR EVERY MORNING.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, YOUNG LADY, YOU ARE... OFF MUSIC CAREER OF 40 YEARS, YOU
ARE A NINE TIME GRAMMY WINNER,
IN THE ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAME, THE BLUES HALL OF FAME AND
YET "ROLLING STONE" WRITER ANTHONY DECURTIS SAID THAT YOU ARE VASTLY UNDERRATED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT NEXT?
TO BE IN THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK I'VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY.
>> Stephen: HE SAYS HOWEVER GREAT YOU ARE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW GREAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE.
>> I PAID HIM TO SAY THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: REALLY.
NOW DID YOU... YOUR NEW ALBUM IS YOUR 19th ALBUM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S OUT ON YOUR OWN RECORD LABEL HERE CALLED RED WING.
IS IT HARD TO START YOUR OWN LABEL?
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE ESTABLISHED I THINK IT'S EASIER,
YOU KNOW, WITH THE WINTER NET AND THE WAY MUSIC IS BEING DELIVERED IF YOU HAVE A GOOD
PRESCRIPTION TEAM YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: ONE OF THE SONGS PEOPLE KNOW YOU BEST FOR IS
"ANGEL FROM MONTGOMERY" WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL SONG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR ENJOYING MY QUESTION.
AND THE FIRST LINE OF THE SONG IS "I AM AN OLD WOMAN." NOW, WHEN YOU FIRST SANG THAT SONG...
>> (LAUGHS)
>> Stephen:... YOU WERE NOT AN OLD WOMAN.
AND NOW YOU ARE ALSO NOT AN OLD WOMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> OH, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: BUT IF YOU WERE, HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT SONG?
DOES IT CHANGE NOW THAT YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE AGE OF THE WOMAN WHO SANG IN THAT SONG?
>> WHEN I SANG IT I WAS 23, 24 WHEN JOHN PRIN AND I FIRST STARTED OUT AND I JUST TO...
USED TO SING IT HOPING I WOULDN'T WASTE MY LIFE AND NOW THAT I'M FOUR DECADES ON I'M
JUST GRATEFUL THAT I HAD THOSE CHOICES-- AS YOU WERE CELEBRATING EARLIER.
>> Stephen: OH, BY THE WAY, YOU ARE A WOMAN.
(LAUGHTER) AND I... I RESPECT THAT.
>> (LAUGHS) I RESPECT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL.
>> I SENSE THAT AND I'M ALSO GETTING THAT HEAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BE CAREFUL.
I HAVE A BEAN TO PICK W YOU.
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE ACTIVIST TYPES.
YOU'RE A NO NUKES ENVIRONMENTAL LADY, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, I KNEW THIS WAS COMING.
>> Stephen: LET ME GUESS, YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY DON'T USE ELECTRICITY.
YOU HAVE 11 HOUSES AND THEY ALL RUN ON BABY SEAL MEET.
(LAUGHTER) DO YOU WALK THE WALK, BABY?
>> I WALK THE WALK.
I'M NOT PERFECT BUT I TRY TO CONSERVE WHERE I CAN.
I SWITCHED THE LIGHTBULBS OUT, I DRIVE A HYBRID.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT YOU DON'T SING SONGS ABOUT CONSERVATION, DO YOU?
>> I THINK MY AUDIENCE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE A HIKE IF I DID.
>> Stephen: THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
PEOPLE WERE SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE POLITICAL ISSUES THEY CARED ABOUT.
I DON'T SEE THAT MUCH ANYMORE.
DO YOU REGRET THAT'S NOT AROUND ANYMORE?
>> WITH THE OCCUPY MOVEMENT I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE
INTERESTED IN HAVING A VOCAL...
THEIR POINTS OF VIEW OUT THERE.
THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL BANTER.
ESPECIALLY ON THE INTERNET.
PEOPLE CAN PUT UP THEIR YOUTUBE... SOME SONGS ARE A LITTLE PEDANTIC OR CORNY BUT
OTHER ONES ARE GREAT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD PEDANTIC MEANS BUT THAT'S GOOD.
(LAUGHTER) SPEAKING OF SONGS YOU'VE GOT A SONG RIGHT NOW HITTING THE CHARTS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IT IS YOUR REPORTING OF THE GREAT JERRY RAFFERTY SONG...
>> WHOSE 65th BIRTHDAY WOULD HAVE BEEN TODAY.
>> Stephen: IT'S CALLED "RIGHT DOWN THE LINE."
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE VERSION.
COME BACK, PLAY IT FOR US?
>> THANK YOU.
NEXT TIME YOU'LL SING WITH ME.
>> Stephen: MAYBE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
