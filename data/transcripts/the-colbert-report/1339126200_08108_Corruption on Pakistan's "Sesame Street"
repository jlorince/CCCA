( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN STLAM STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
MINDLESS ZOMBIES!
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH PAKISTAN.
IT'S SORT OF A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP.
THEY LOVE TO HATE US.
WND AND WE HATE THAT WE HAVE TO LOVE THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: STILL THEY ARE A VALUABLE ALLY IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR.
THAT'S WHY I'M SO UP SET TO HEAR ABOUT THE END OF A CRUCIAL NATIONAL SECURITY
OPERATION IN THE HEART OF ISLAMABAD.
JIM?
>> THE U.S. EMBASSY IN PAKISTAN ENDING FUNDING FOR A LOCAL VERSION OF "SESAME STREET".
THE MOVE COMES AMID REPORTS OF CORRUPTION AT THE 20 MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT.
>> Stephen: $20 MILLION OF CORRUPTION ON "SESAME STREET".
I BELIEVE CONGRESS NEEDS TO HOLD HEARINGS AND ASK SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS.
WHAT ELMO KNOW AND WHEN ELMO KNOW IT!
(LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, THIS SHOW CALLED SIM SIM HAMMARA HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PRODUCTION IN
PAKISTAN FOR A YEAR AND WAS CREATED WITH A GRANT FROM THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING EDUCATION AND INCREASING TOLERANCE.
IT WAS OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF A PUPPET IN THE REGION SINCE HAMID KARZAI.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT VERY LIFE LIKE.
VERY LIFE LIKE.
BUT AN INVESTIGATION OF CORRUPTION HAS BEEN LAUNCHED THANKS TO A TIP BETWEEN A
STATE DEPARTMENT TELEPHONE HOTLINE.
ALTHOUGH IT DID TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THAT HOTLINE TO GET ANSWERED.
>> BRING.
>> OH, BRING.
>> Stephen: NOW ACCORDING TO PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS, THE CORRUPT PUPPETEARS OR
CORRUPTE TEERS BEHIND SIM SIM HAMMARA WERE USING U.S.
MONEY TO PAY OFF OLD DEBTS AND AWARDING LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS TO RELATIVES.
AND THAT'S NOT ALL, FOLKS.
THE REPORT HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE UNDERCOVER FOOTAGE OF THE CORRUPTION IN ACTION.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
>> Stephen: WE CAUGHT ELMO RED HANDED.
FOLKS, THAT GUY IS BAD NEWS.
NOT ONLY HAS HE BEEN LINKED TO STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM,
HE'S ALSO BEEN LINKED TO APE SPONSORED TERRORISM.
I HOPE THIS MESS GETS CLEARED UP SOON.
OUR PAKISTANI PUPPET PROGRAM IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.
REMEMBER, THAT IS HOW WE FOUND OSAMA BIN LADEN.
FIRST WE ASKED THE CHILDREN OF ABBOTTA DOES BAD, WHO ARE THE PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, AND IT
