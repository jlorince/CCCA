EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
MULTITALENTED MUSICIAN WITH A
NEW ALBUM CALLED "BREAK IT
YOURSELF."
IF HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE MUSIC
INDUSTRY, IT'S TOO LATE.
PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW BIRD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
HEY, MR. BIRD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
A LOT OF BIG FANS IN THIS
BUILDING.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SIR, YOU'RE UNIQUE
AMONG SOME MUSICIANS BECAUSE
YOU'VE BUILT THIS SLOW
POPULARITY OVER 15 YEARS.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE LIKE A RAG
SOAKED WITH GASOLINE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND TONIGHT, BOOM, I'M DROPPING
A MATCH ON IT CALLED THE COLBERT
BUMP.
ARE YOU READY?
ARE YOU READY TO BE SUPER
FAMOUS?
>> YEAH.
I THINK I CAN HANDLE THE BURDEN.
>> Stephen: CAN WE TALK ABOUT
YOUR MUSIC FOR A SECOND?
>> SURE.
LET'S.
>> Stephen: THE SONG YOU'RE
GOING TO PLAY TONIGHT, IT IS
CALLED "EYE ON EYE."
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND IT FEATURES...
THANK YOU.
PLEASE DO NOT APPLAUD MY
QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY'RE DONE.
IT FEATURES WHISTLING, GLOCKEN
SPIEL AND IT WAS INSPIRED BY
TALKING ABOUT THE TUMOR THAT'S A
FATTY MASS OF HAIR.
>> IT'S LIKE A TUMOR THAT
REPLICATES PARTS OF CELLS IN THE
BODY LIKE TEETH OR HAIR.
>> Stephen: THAT'S PRETTY
OBVIOUS POP SONG TERRITORY.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MORE RISKS?
>> I GO FOR UNIVERSAL SUBJECTS
LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: WE'VE ALL BEEN
THERE.
WE'VE ALL HAD A FATTY MASS OF
THREET AND HAIR.
>> THAT PART ISN'T IN THE SONG
BECAUSE THAT'S DISGUSTING.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF FATTY
MASS OF TEETH AND HAIR, YOU
WORKED AT RENAISSANCE FESTIVALS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: KID YOU ALSO PLAY
FUNERALS?
>> A FEW.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS SADDER?
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU KNOW, OF COURSE THE
FUNERAL IS SADDER, BUT THE
RENAISSANCE FAIR TESTS YOUR
SENSE OF DIGNITY, THOUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO ASK
YOU A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION
THAT ONE OF MY WRITERS PROVIDED.
IT GOES LIKE THIS: YOUR MUSIC IS
EMOTIONALLY EVOCATIVE.
HYPE THELTICALLY, ONE OF MY
WRITERS CAN'T LISTEN TO THE
ALBUM WITHOUT THINKING OF 2006.
HE HAD A CRUSH ON A FRIEND WHO
MADE IT CLEAR THAT NOTHING WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT AFTER
HALLOWEEN PARTY WHERE HE WAS
DRESSED UP AS GAY AND LINCOLN
AND SHE WAS DRESSED AS RAGGEDY
ANN, THEY MADE OUT FOR HOURS
WITH THAT ALBUM REPEATING ALL
NIGHT ONLY THE HAVE HER SAY NEXT
DAY IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE, SHE
LOVED SOMEBODY ELSE.
CAN YOU SUGGEST HOW HE COULD GET
THAT ASSOCIATION OUT OF HIS HEAD
SO HE CAN LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC
AGAIN?
[APPLAUSE]
>> A FRIEND OF MINE SAYS YOU
JUST THINK OF PRIVATE DANCER BY
TINA TURNER AND THAT OBLIT RATES
ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: FOR ME YOU JUST GO
"BY MENNEN."
CAN YOU STICK AROUND AND DO THE
SONG?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: THANK
