NATION...
[LAUGHTER]
WE'LL CHECK THE TAPE LATER, SEE IF I DID THAT RIGHT.
NATION, IF THE ATTEMPTED TIMES SQUARE BOMBING HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT THREATS ARE EVERYWHERE.
THAT'S WHY NOW EVERY TIME I WALK BY PARKED S.U.V., I CALL THE COPS.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, TONIGHT I PROFILE A NEW THREAT THAT TAKES US TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST WHERE THE
AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE IS LITERALLY ON THE LINE.
I WONDER WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.
LET'S FIND OUT.
JIM?
BEND, OREGON, THE PERFECT PLACE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
LOCAL REALTOR TERRY BLACKWELL.
>> BEND IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE, GREAT CLIMATE, A GOOD PLACE TO RAISE FAMILY.
>> Stephen: OR IT WAS, UNTIL THIS WOMAN MOVED, IN SUSAN TAYLOR, NURSE, HOMEMAKER AND THE
ENEMY WITHIN.
♪♪
[LAUGHTER]
FOR THREE YEARS SUSANTY -- SUSAN TAYLOR'S NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF HER QUESTIONABLE LIFESTYLE.
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE ACTIVITY SHE'S INVOLVED IN ARE WHAT THEY'RE AGAINST.
>> I THINK IT DEVALUES OUR PROPERTY.
>> IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT ANYONE WOULD FIND OFFENSE WITH WHAT I'M DOING.
>> Stephen: UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING.
RIGHT IN HER BECOME YARD.
DRYING HER CLOTHES, NOT IN A DRIER.
>> YOU GOT THE BEST DRIER RIGHT OUT HERE.
IT'S CALLED THE SUN AND THE WIND.
>> Stephen: IT'S ALSO CALLED "A VIOLATION," BECAUSE SUSAN
LIVES IN A SUBDIVISION WHERE THERE ARE RULES.
>> EVERYONE, WHEN THEY MOVE IN HERE, SIGNS A DOCUMENT AND AGREES TO SEVERAL STIPULATIONS.
AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS CLEARLY STATES THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE AN OUTDOOR CLOTHESLINE.
>> WHEN YOU CHOOSE WHERE YOU WANT TO LIVE, YOU CAN PICK ONE WHERE THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE
SAME VALUES.
>> Stephen: BUT SUSAN TAYLOR HAS NO VALUES.
JUST LISTEN TO HER RECOUNT THE SORDID DETAILS OF THE DAY SHE LOST HER CLOTHESLINE VIRGINITY.
>> I FELT LIKE, OH, GOD, THIS IS WRONG, THIS IS THE WRONG THING TO BE DOING.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS JUST DRIVEN AND THINKING, NOTHING COULD EVER BE SO RIGHT, SO
RIGHT, SO RIGHT.
>> Stephen: PRETTY SOON SHE WAS DOING IT EVERY DAY, AND SHE
DIDN'T CARE WHO HAD THE LOOK AT IT.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.
>> Stephen: REALTOR TERRY POLAK.
NOW GO IN SLOW NATION.
OH, SHE'S GOOD.
REALTOR TERRY BLACKWELL RECOUNTS THE HORROR.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A HORROR THING.
I THINK IT'S JUST AN IRRITATION.
>> Stephen: AN IRRITATION.
>> I BELIEVE THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER THEM TO BE AN EYESORE.
>> Stephen: SORE EYES.
>> WHAT I AM DOING DOESN'T HURT ANYTHING OR ANYBODY.
>> Stephen: NOT SO SAYS PHILIP SEYMOUR SWEATERVEST.
>> A CLOTHES LINE COULD IN A RARE SITUATION BE A DANGER.
>> Stephen: DANGER.
[LAUGHTER]
NEIGHBORS HAVE TRIED REASONING WITH HER, BUT THERE IS NO TALKING TO A CRAZY WOMAN.
>> I ENJOY HAVING FUN, AND I DO SOME PRETTY CRAZY THINGS, BUT ACTUALLY I AM NOT CRAZY.
I AM ABSOLUTELY... I AM NOT CRAZY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
THEY EVEN TRIED FINING HER.
>> TO DATE WE HAVE BEEN FINED $994.50.
>> Stephen: BUT NOTHING WILL STOP SUSAN TAYLOR.
>> SO I STOPPED.
>> .
>> Stephen: OH, THAT WAS EASY.
OH, JESUS CHRIST.
SO SHE MET ALEXANDER LEE,
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST AND THE CHARISMATIC LEADER OF THE "RIGHT TO DRY" MOVEMENT.
BRACE YOURSELF FOR HIS SHOCKING REVELATION.
>> UM, UH, LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]
YEAH, I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HANG OUT THEIR CLOATSZ.
>> Stephen: HE AND SUSAN TAYLOR ARE ON A MISSION, AND THEY'RE NOT ALONE.
>> THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE LIKE HER ALL OTHER THE COUNTRY WHO ARE AFFECTED BY
SIMILAR RULES.
>> Stephen: DOZENS.
>> HUNDREDS.
>> Stephen: HUNDREDS?
>> THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OVER PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: THOUSANDS OF SUSAN TAYLORS CREEPING AROUND YOUR BACKYARD, AND THEY'RE NOT
STOPPING AT THE CLOTHESLINE.
NO, THESE TWO RIGHT-TO-DRIERS ARE ON A MISSION TO TAKE AWAY OUR RIGHT TO DRYERS.
>> WE COULD GET RID OF THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF HOUSEHOLD DRIERS
THAT ARE CONSUMING POWER PLANTS WORTH OF ELECTRICITY, WE'D BE MAKING A HUGE STEP.
>> WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THESE DRYERS?
>> Stephen: WE ARE LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM, CELEBRATING A LONG TRADITION OF LIVING ELECTRICALLY.
>> MO MORE CLOTHESLINE.
THIS THING GETS CLOTHES DRY QUICKLY.
>> Stephen: A PROUD TRADITION THAT MAY BE LOST TO OUR CHILDREN.
SO, AMERICA, SET YOUR DRIER TO HIGH ALERT, BECAUSE HANGING OUT IN YOUR BACKYARD YOU MAY FIND
THE ENEMY WITHIN.
>> WE DON'T THINK LIKE THAT.||||
