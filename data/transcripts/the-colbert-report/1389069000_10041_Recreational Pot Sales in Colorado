WELCOME BACK, THANKS SOMUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MYFIRST SHOW OF 2014, AND IN
THIS NEW YEAR ALL OF US AREMAKING NEW AREA'S
RESOLUTIONS.
PERSONALLY I JOINED AGYM-BORE.
I USUALLY DO SIX REPS OFPARACHUTES AND TWO SETS OF
BOUNCEY BALL FCHLOE IS NOTHOGGING IT.
I'M COOLING DOWN HERE, CHLOE,LET ME WORK IN.
BUT FOLKS, WHILE I'M OUTTHERE GETTING SKINNY,
AMERICA'S DEVIANTS AREROLLING A FATTIE, JIM?
>> SOME COLORADOANS HAVE ALOT TO CELEBRATE ON JANUARY
1st.
COLORADO BECAME THE FIRSTSTATE IN THE NATION TO ALLOW
THE SALE OF MARIJUANA FORRECREATIONAL USE AND
HUNDREDS LINED UP TO GET IT.
>> $1 MILLION OFRECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
REPORTEDLY SOLD THERE ONWEDNESDAY ALONE.
>> Stephen: A MILLIONDOLLARS OF POT IN ONE DAY.
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A FULLNELSON.
NATION, THIS NEWS, THIS NEWSNAUSEATED ME SO MUCH THAT I
MIGHT QUALIFIED FOR MEDICALMARIJUANA.
CAN SOMEONE CHECK ON THAT.
YOU CAN GET ON THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AMERICA'S MORAL CORPS ISBEING GUTTED AND THE REST OF
OUR MORAL APPLE IS BEINGMADE INTO A BONG.
HOW DARE, HOW DARECOLORADOANS SPEND JANUARY
1st RUINING THEIR BODIESWITH WEED WHEN THEY SHOULD
BE AT HOME VOMITING ALL THEBOOZE FROM NEW YEAR'S EVE
LIKE GOD INTENDED.
AND THANKFULLY-- (APPLAUSE)
YES.
WE HAVE SOME VOMIT FANS HERETONIGHT THANKFULLY SOME
PATRIOTS ARE STANDING UP ANTHEY'RE NOT JUST IGNORANT
BUZZ KILLS THEY'REEXPERIENCED BUZZ KILLS LIKE
"NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNISTDAVID BROOKS WHO WROTE FOR A
LITTLE WHILE IN MY TEENAGEYEARS MY FRIENDS AND I
SMOKED MARIJUANA.
IT WAS FUN.
I HAVE SOME FOND MEMORIES OFUS ALL BEING SILLY TOGETHER.
I THINK THOSE MOMENTS OFUNINHIBITIED FROLIC DEEPENED
OUR FRIENDSHIP.
YES.
DAVID BROOKS GOT HIGH.
WHICH LEAD TO UNINHIBITIEDFROLIC.
SOMETIMES IT BORDERED ONUNSTRUCTURED MERIMENT, EVEN
UNFETTERED JOCULARITY.
BUT THIS COLUMN WAS MORETHAN JUST ESTABLISHING HIS
STONE-COLD STREET CRED.
HE ALSO RAPPED SOME POSITIVEYOUTH MESSAGING ABOUT THE
DANGERS OF LEGALLIZATIONSAYING I THINK BEING STONED
IS NOT A PARTICULARLYUPLIFTING FORM OF PLEASURE
AND SHOULD BE DISCOVERAGEDMORE THAN ENCOURAGED.
AND THAT COLORADO ISNURTURING A MORAL ECOLOGY IN
WHICH IT IS A BIT HARDER TOBE THE SORT OF PERSON MOST
OF US WANT TO BE.
SO LET THAT BE A LESSON TOYOU KIDS.
YOU KEEP SMOKING WEED, YOUKEEP RAPPING WITH YOUR
FRIENDS, YOU'LL NEVER GROWUP TO BE DAVID BROOKS.
AND DAVID'S NOT THE ONLYFORMER POT HEAD WHO WANTS TO
KEEP WEED ILLEGAL.
SO DOES "THE WASHINGTONPOST" RUTH MARCUS WHO WROTE
IN AN OP ED, OUR KIDS WILLNOT BE BETTER OFF WITH
ANOTHER LEGAL MIND ALTERINGSUBSTANCE.
WELL SAID.
KIDS DON'T NEED ANOTHERLEGAL MIND ALTERING
SUBSTANCE, IN SCHOOL WITHTHEIR ATEROL.
AND LIKE BROOKS, FOLKS, RUTHADMITS TO BEING MORE THAN
JUST ROOMMATES WITH HERFRIEND MARY JANE CONFESSING
I HAVE DONE MY SHARE OFINHALING.
NEXT TIME I'M IN COLORADO IEXPECT I WILL CHECK OUT SOME
BUBBA KUSH.
WHY NOT.
WHY NOT.
OTHER THAN THE COLUMN YOUJUST WROTE.
I APPLAUD MARCUS AND BROOKSFOR TAKE A STIRM STANCE
AGAINST LEGALIZING THE POTTHEY SMOKED.
I ASSUME THEY'RE GOING TOTURN THEMSELVES INTO THE
POLICE NOW AND SERVE THEIRKIND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL
KEEP THEM FROM EVER SMOKINGAGAIN BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET
HIGH AND WRITE SOMETHINGREALLY CONFUSING.
WELL AN RIGHT BACK
