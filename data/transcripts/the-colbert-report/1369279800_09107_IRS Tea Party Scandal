>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
NATION, YOU KNOW, PLEASE...
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU PEOPLE ARE THE GREATEST.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS
LIKE I DO, YOU KNOW THAT THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS
EMBROILED IN SO MANY SCANDALS
THAT TRYING TO PICK WHICH ONE TO
REPORT ON IS LIKE TRYING TO PICK
WHICH OF YOUR CHILDREN TO
IMPEACH.
NOW, FOR THE RECORD, IT'S THE
ONE WHO ATE CHIPS IN DADDY'S
DEN.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.
THANKFULLY, CONGRESS MADE THE
DECISION FOR ME TODAY BY PUTTING
THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE IRS WHO
HAVE ADMITTED TO TARGETING TEA
PARTY GROUPS.
NOW, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE
RESIGNATION OF ACTING
COMMISSIONER STEVEN MILLER, BUT
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER
BELIEVES WE CAN DO MORE.
>> MY QUESTION ISN'T ABOUT WHO
IS GOING TO RESIGN.
MY QUESTION IS WHO IS GOING TO
JAIL OVER THIS SCANDAL.
>> Stephen: BOEHNER, OUT!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE ABOUT 25
MINUTES OF SHOW LEFT TO DO.
BUT, FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO SAY M.C.
TANGERINE DREAM IS RIGHT.
THIS IRS THING IS A JAILABLE
OFFENSE AND OBAMA KNOWS IT.
I MEAN JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HE
SAID TO JOE BIDEN.
>> DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS
MEANS?
SCANDAL AND PRISON.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.
ONE OF US IS GOING TO JAIL.
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ME.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
WHO IS THAT SQUIRREL?
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?
IS HE CONNECTED TO ACORN?
I WANT HIS NUTS ON A PLATTER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELL, FOLKS, TODAY CONGRESS
FINALLY HEARD FROM LOIS LERNER,
AN I.R.S. OFFICIAL AND I BELIEVE
SUPERMAN'S EX-GIRLFRIEND.
AND THE PERSON WHO FIRST
REVEALED THAT TEA PARTY GROUPS
WERE BEING TARGETED BY THE
I.R.S.
FINALLY, AFTER WEEKS OF
DEMANDING ANSWERS WE IN CABLE
NEWS CAN STOP FILLING 24 HOURS
WITH WILD, RIVETTING AND
ACTUALLY PLAUSIBLE THEORIES OF
INTERAGENCY CONSPIRACY AND JUST
GET DOWN TO THE COLD, HARD FACTS
SO WE CAN END THIS RAMPANT AND
EXCITING SPECULATION.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
SO, WHAT DID SHE SAY?
>> I'VE BEEN ADVISED BY MY
COUNSEL TO ASSERT MY
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOT TO
TESTIFY OR ANSWER QUESTIONS
RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
THIS HEARING.
>> Stephen: YES!
I MEAN, WHAT?
I MEAN, WITHOUT HER TESTIMONY,
WE'LL BE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT
OUR IMAGINATION.
>> WHY WON'T LERNER SPILL THE
BEANS ABOUT WHAT SHE KNOWS?
>> WHY IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
HIDE AND YOU'RE A TRUTH TELLER
AND YOU'RE OF A SOUND MIND AND
SHE SEEMS TO BE.
WHY DOESN'T SHE SIT IN THAT
WITNESS STAND AND ANSWER
TRUTHFULLY?
WHAT DOES SHE GOT TO BE AFRAID
OF?
>> THE SUSPICION IS GROWING THAT
SOMEONE OR OTHER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION USED THE
MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT TO GET
ITSELF RE-ELECTED IN 2012,
WHETHER IT WAS THE I.R.S. OR
WHETHER IT WAS KNOCKING OUT CAR
DEALERSHIPS THAT BELONGED TO
REPUBLICANS.
>> REMEMBER GEORGE ORWELL'S
1984?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS.
SHE WANTS TO PROTECT HERSELF OR
SHE'S TAKING THE FIFTH BECAUSE
SHE WANTS TO PROTECT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
DOES SHE HAVE A FEAR FOR THE
WHITE HOUSE OR A FEAR FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE?
>> IS IT SNOWING?
IS IT SHE KNOWS SHE'S DONE
SOMETHING WRONG THAT ONLY
AFFECTS THE I.R.S.?
OR IS IT SHE KNOWS THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG THAT GOES ABOVE
HER?
>> Stephen: YES, DOES SHE KNOW?
AND WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?
AND HOW DO WE KNOW SHE.
>> S WHAT SHE KNOWS?
AND DID OBAMA KNOW WHAT SHE
KNOWS THAT SHE KNEW?
AND WHAT ABOUT JOHN SUNUNU?
AND, FOLKS, ULTIMATELY IS ALL
THIS JUST A WAY TO COVER UP THE
FACT THAT SOLYNDRA SOLD SOLAR
PANELS TO THE CONSULATE IN
BENGHAZI USING THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS AS A MULE TO SMUGGLE GUNS
INTO MEXICO AS PART OF FAST AND
FURIOUS?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANKS TO MRS. LERNER'S REFUSAL
TO TESTIFY, THAT'S AS A
