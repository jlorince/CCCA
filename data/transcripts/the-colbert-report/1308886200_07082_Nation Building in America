SO WAKE THE KIDS AND ASK
THEM WHO JACK WHITE IS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT FIRST,
AFGHANISTAN.
LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT
ADDRESSED THE NATION FROM
THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE
HOUSE, OR AS IT'S BEEN
OFFICIALLY RENAMED,THE I
KILLED BIN LADEN ROOM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: PERSONALLY I
THOUGHT IT WAS IN POOR TASTE
FOR THEM TO PUT UP THE
CHAMPIONSHIP BANNER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ANYWAY, YOU'VE
ALL HEARD THE HEADLINES.
HE HAS ORDERED A WITHDRAWAL
FROM AFGHANISTAN WHICH MEANS
OBAMA'S A COWARD FOR
LEAVING.
OR FOR NOT LEAVING SOONER.
I FORGET WHICH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT THE REAL
SHOCKER, FOLKS, WAS WHERE HE
IS WASTING OUR BLOOD AND
TREASURE NEXT.
>> AMERICA, IT IS TIME TO
FOCUS ON NATION BUILDING
HERE AT HOME.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WE TRIED NATION
BUILDING IN AFGHANISTAN.
IT TOOK US TEN YEARS TO GET
OUT.
DO WE REALLY WANT TO GET
SUCKED INTO ANOTHER QUAGMIRE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I MEAN THINK OF
THE CHALLENGES.
IF THE COUNTRY WAS CRUMBLING
INFRASTRUCTURE, IT BARELY
FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY, LARGE
AREAS COMPLETELY BEYOND THE
GOVERNMENT'S CONTROL, AND
WITH A POPULATION OF POORLY
EDUCATED-- HEAVILY ARMED
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS WHO
HATE THEIR GOVERNMENT, AND I
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO
DESCRIBE THE STOMACH
CHURNING HUMAN-RIGHTS ABUSES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SO PLEASE,
PLEASE THINK BEFORE YOU TRY
NATION BUILDING HERE,
MR. PRESIDENT.
BECAUSE IF YOU BREAK IT, YOU
BOUGHT IT.
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE
AMERICA BECOME AMERICA'S
