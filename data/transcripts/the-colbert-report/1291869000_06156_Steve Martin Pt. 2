BACK TO THE SHOW.
I AM HONORED TO ONCE AGAIN BE
JOINED BY NOTED ART COLLECTOR
STEVE MARTIN.
STEVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: STEVE, AS I SAID
BEFORE, I HAVE A PIECE OF ART
I'D LIKE TO INTEREST YOU IN AS A
NOTED COLLECTOR.
IT'S BEHIND THIS PERSON.
WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU...
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: WOW.
YES, THIS IS LAST YEAR'S
PORTRAIT.
>> YES.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, SEEING THIS
PICTURE MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH
I LOVE THE RED CURTAIN.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THIS IS ART.
WE KNOW IT'S ART BECAUSE THE
PREVIOUS ONE...
>> IT CERTAINLY TAKES THE FORM
OF IT.
GO AHEAD.
>> Stephen: IT'S IN A FRAME
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW
MUCH YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY
FOR LAST YEAR'S PORTRAIT?
>> WELL, I'M COMPUTING THE VALUE
OF IT.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF INKJET COSTS
IN IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THREE TONER
CARTRIDGES.
>> THREE TONER CARTRIDGES.
SO WE'RE PROBABLY AT ABOUT A $19
ITEM.
THAT'S IF I WANTED IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: WAIT.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT THAT?
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF ME.
IT LOOKS LIKE ME.
>> THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: HOLD IT.
LET ME SHOW YOU ANOTHER
PORTRAIT.
JIM, CAN WE PLEASE PUT THE
PORTRAIT UP BY THE FAMOUS
ARTIST.
THIS IS A PORTRAIT.
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE ARTIST?
>> YES, I DO, FRANK STELLA.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A VIDEO
PROJECTION OF ONE OF HIS
PORTRAITS OF A MAN NAMED CARL
ANDRE.
THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A
PERSON.
THAT DOES.
IS THIS... WOULD YOU BUY THIS?
IS THIS WORTH MONEY?
>> THIS IS A HIGHLY VALUABLE
WORK OF ART.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I HAPPEN TO
HAVE MR. STELLA RIGHT HERE.
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME THE
FATHER OF MINIMALISM, FRANK
STELLA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MR. STELLA, WHY... THAT IS AN
IMAGE OF YOUR ART, CARL ANDRE, A
PORTRAIT.
FIRST OF ALL, IS THAT A GOOD
LIKENESS OF HIM?
>> WELL, I REALLY THINK IT IS,
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT,
THOUGH.
YOU DIDN'T LOOK HARD ENOUGH.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY
CHANCE THAT THIS IS A NUDE OF
HIM?
SHOULD I BE BLURRING OUT ANY
PART OF THAT?
>> I THINK YOU FOUND IT.
>> Stephen: THAT LITTLE CORNER
THERE.
NOW WHAT ABOUT... IS THIS ART?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN DECLARE
THIS TO BE ART?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN JUST LOOK
AT IT?
IS THAT A SUPERPOWER YOU HAVE?
HOW BY LOOKING AT IT CAN YOU
DECLARE IT TO BE ART?
>> IT'S WHAT ANYBODY CAN DO.
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT ART, YOU
CAN FIND IT.
>> Stephen: MR. STELLA, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
FRANK STELLA, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT.
STEVE, FRANK STELLA, FATHER OF
MINIMALISM, OKAY, MR. BIG SHOT
PAINTER OVER HERE, HE SAYS THIS
IS ART.
IS IT NOW MORE VALUABLE?
>> I THINK FRANK STELLA SHOULD
BUY IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: AND YOU?
>> NO THANK YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO CHANGE IT
IN SOME WAY.
WOULD THAT HELP?
>> THAT MIGHT HELP.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE ANOTHER
ARTIST HERE.
PLEASE PUT UP ONE OF THE WORKS
OF THE NEXT ARTIST.
OKAY, THIS IS A PORTRAIT OF AUNG
SAN SUU KYI BUT SHEPARD FAIREY,
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HIS WORK?
>> YES, I AM.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
HE'S A BRILLIANT YOUNG ARTIST.
SHEPARD, WOULD YOU PLEASE COME
ON OUT HERE.
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> Stephen: SHEPARD, YOU ARE
KNOWN FOR REPURPOSING IMAGES
THAT PREVIOUSLY EXISTED FOR YOUR
OWN WORK.
ARE YOU INSPIRED TO DO ANYTHING
ON THIS ONE RIGHT NOW?
>> I AM, BUT I HAVE TO QUALIFY
THAT WITH I THINK IT'S BEYOND
AESTHETIC REDEMPTION, BUT I
CAN...
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, BUT ARE YOU READY TO
GET YOUR ART ON?
>> I CAN CHANGE THE MEANING IN A
WAY THAT WILL DEFINITELY BENEFIT
ME.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.
LET'S DO IT.
GIVE THE MAN A LITTLE ROOM HERE.
>> YES, SIR.
GOOD.
THAT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT TO SHAKE
THE CAN.
IF YOU DON'T SHAKE THE CAN, THE
ART DOESN'T TAKE.
( LAUGHTER )
DO YOU EVER HUFF THAT STUFF?
>> OH, YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: SHEPARD, YOU DID
THE OBAMA POSTER TOO, RIGHT?
>> YES, I DID.
THE HOPE POSTER.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU
FEELING ABOUT THAT NOW?
HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT HOPE
STUFF THESE DAYS?
( LAUGHTER )
>> UM, YOU KNOW, I'M PROUD OF IT
AS A PIECE OF GRASSROOTS
ACTIVISM, BUT I'LL JUST LEAVE IT
AT THAT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
JIM, CAN WE GET A CLOSEUP OF
THAT?
NOW, SHEP, WHAT DID YOU DO TO
IT?
>> WELL, I MADE YOUR AGENDA AS
AN OMNIPOTENT QUASI FASCIST...
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR THE
"QUASI."
>> ...ORATOR AND SHAPER OF OUR
POLITICS AND CULTURE THAT MUCH
MORE OBVIOUS AS MANIPULATION.
>> Stephen: SHEPARD, I
COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR MORE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SHEPARD FAIREY.
THANK YOU, SHEP.
ALL RIGHT, STEVE.
ALL RIGHT.
TOTALLY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
HE PUT PAINT HERE AND HE PUT
PAINT UP THERE.
COULD I SELL THIS NOW?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS IS NOW A VIABLE ARTWORK.
IT COULD BE AUCTIONED AND IT
WOULD DO WELL.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT
CONTROVERSY?
DOES THAT HELP?
>> CONTROVERSY WOULD DEFINITELY
HELP.
>> Stephen: I'VE GOT THE MAN
FOR YOU.
JIM, LET'S HAVE NEXT IMAGE.

NEXT ARTIST.
IT'S CALLED "EJACULATE
INTRAJECTORY 14."
>> I'M WAY BEYOND THAT.
YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THIS IS BY THE
ARTIST ANDRE SERRANO, YOU MAY
KNOW HIM FROM HIS WORK "PISS
CHRIST."
IT CAUSED A BIT OF A STIR.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

>> OH, BOY.
>> Stephen: ANDRE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
I LOVE THIS, BY THE WAY.
>> OH, THANK YOU.

IN ONE TAKE?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, WHEN I FIRST
