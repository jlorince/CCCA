( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY.
FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, NATION, I HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE
RIGHT NOW.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS, I AM INTERRUPTING
TONIGHT'S REGULARLY SCHEDULED
BROADCAST TO BRING YOU BREAKING
NEWS.
REPEAT: TONIGHT'S COLBERT REPORT
WILL NOT BE SEEN BECAUSE THERE
HAS BEEN A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
TRAGIC ATTACK ON OUR EMBASSY IN
BENGHAZI, LIBYA.
SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER, FOX NEWS
HAS BEEN PURSUING THIS STORY
DOGGEDLY TO UNCOVER HOW THE
ADMINISTRATION BLEW IT, WHEN
THEY BLEW IT, WHY THEY BLEW IT,
AND HOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO
HAVE BLOWN IT.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW IS
THIS CAR STILL BURNING?
I MEAN IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOR GOD'S SAKE, THE MACCABEES'
OIL ONLY LASTED EIGHT DAYS.
IF THAT ISN'T SUSPICIOUS, IT'S
AT LEAST MIRACULOUS.
WELL, BUCKLE UP, FOLKS.
CLICK-CLICK.
BECAUSE, THIS STORY IS ABOUT TO
TAKE OFF LIKE A ROCKETSHIP TO
PLANET SCANDAL TOWN.
>> THE TENSION IS MOUNTING IN
THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
THAT'S WHERE IN JUST ONE DAY, WE
WILL HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF THREE
WHITTLE BLOWERS ABOUT THE
BENGHAZI TERROR ATTACK.
>> WHAT ONE SAYS COULD SHAKE UP
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
BIG-TIME.
>> IT'S GOING TO BE EXPLOSIVE.
EXPLOSIVE.
INDEED.
THESE ARE BIG, BIG CHARGES.
>> THE DAM IS ABOUT TO BREAK ON
BENGHAZI.
IT WILL MAKE YOU MAD.
>> Stephen: IT'S GOING TO MAKE
ME MAD?
OH, I FEEL LIKE A KID ON
CHRISTMAS EVE WHO IS ABOUT TO
GET THE BIKE HE ASKED FOR... AND
IT'S ON FIRE.
SO, JUST WHAT ARE THESE WHISTLE
BLOWERS GOING TO SAY?
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE GUYS
ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS THE
BEST POSSIBLE KIND OF POLITICAL
STORY.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S IN IT AND
IT'S GOING TO BE EXPLOSIVE.
IT'S THE TACO BELL OF BREAKING
NEWS.
SO, JIM,...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I CAN MAKE A RUN FOR THE BORDER.
SO, JIM, LET'S START THE
BENGHAZI COUNT DOWN TO SOMETHING
THAT WILL MAKE YOU MAD CLOCK.
FOLKS, IT IS GREAT.
IT IS WIN-WIN BECAUSE IF
TOMORROW I DON'T LEARN SOMETHING
THAT MAKES ME MAD, I
