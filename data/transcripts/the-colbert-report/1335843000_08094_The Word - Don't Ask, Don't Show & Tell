MONEY.
NOW NATION, I BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN AND HER DOWRY OF CATTLE.
SO I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE A RECENT POLL SHOWING 47% OF AMERICAN SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE WITH ONLY 43% OPPOSED.
WHICH LEAVES 10% WHO SWING BOTH WAYS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW JUST EIGHT YEARS AGO ONLY 31% SUPPORTED GAY MARRIAGE THAT IS A HUGE INCREASE.
THOSE GAYS ARE BREEDING LIKE GAY FLIES.
(LAUGHTER) LUCKILY THERE'S A WAY TO COMBAT THIS EXPLOSION OF TOLERANCE.
AND IT BRINGS US TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DON'T ASK, DON'T SHOW-AND-TELL.
FOLKS, THANKS TO GAY SHOWS LIKE "GLEE" AND "TWO AND A HALF MEN ", YOUNG PEOPLE
TODAY HAVE GROWN-UP BELIEVING HOME SEXUALITY IS NORMAL.
-- THANKFULLY ONE STATE IS FIGHTING TO GET OUR KIDS BACK ON THE STRAIGHT AND NOTHING ELSE.
>> FOR MORE WE TURN TO KSDK ST. LOUIS'S NEWS LEADER.
>> REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN THE MISSOURI HOUSE ARE BACK LEGISLATION TO LIMIT THE
DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN SCHOOLS.
THE SO-CALLED DON'T SAY GAY BILL WOULD PROHIBIT EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
OR MATERIALS THAT DISCUSS IS SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
>> Stephen: YES.
WILL YOU NOT BE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS HOMOSEXUAL KNIT SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN MISSOURI.
OF COURSE, IF THE DON'T SAY GAY BILL-PASSES T WILL INSTANTLY BE KNOWN AS THE YOU KNOW BILL.
NOW DON'T SAY GAY--  (APPLAUSE) DON'T SAY GAY SPONSOR STEVE COOKSON EXPLAINS WHY
HOMOSEXUALITY SHOULD BE A FORBIDDEN SUBJECT IN SCHOOL.
>> I JUST THINK THAT THOSE ARE BETTER LEFT OUTSIDE OF THE CURRICULUM.
>> COOKSON SAYS HE THINKS SCHOOLS NEED TO STICK TO CORE CURRICULUM, MATH,
READING AND SCIENCE.
>> WE NEED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS FOR THE STUDENT BODY AND NOT ON
OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DISTRACTING.
>> Stephen: YES,
HOMOSEXUALITY CAN BE VERY DISTRACTING.
SAY YOU ARE IN MATH CLASS AND THE TEACHER ASKS WHAT IS 5 AND 7.
YOUR ANSWER, GAY.
EVERYONE KNOWS 5 AND 7 ARE KIND OF ODD NUMBERS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW I'M NOT SAYING--  (APPLAUSE) I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE
NECESSARILY GAY, THEY COULD BE LESBIANS.
AND FOLKS--  (LAUGHTER) FINDING OUT-- FINDING OUT THAT HOMOSEXUALITY EXISTS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO
TOLERATING IT.
TAKE IT FROM ME, WHEN I DID SONDHEIM WITH NEIL PATRICK HARRIS HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE FRIENDLY OR PROFESSIONAL AND I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HIM FOR IT.
SO--  (LAUGHTER) TO REMIND MYSELF THAT I DO NOT TRUST HIM, I HAVE TO FIND HOMOSEXUALS I DON'T LIKE.
I JUST HOPE THEY RESPOND TO MY GREGS LIST AD LOOKING FOR BAD GAY MAN TO TEACH ME A LESS ON.
BECAUSE FOLKS-- THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS,
WHERE DOES THE TOLERANCE END.
AS COSPONSOR OF THE BILL, AS COSPONSOR OF THE BILL DWIGHT SCHARNHORST POINTS OUT, WHEN
IT COMES TO OUR SCHOOLS,
QUOTE THERE IS NO NEED TO TALK ABOUT BILLY WANTING TO MARY A GOAT.
THANK YOU, SIR, FOR CUTTING THROUGH THE POLITICALLY CORRECT SPIN OF THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA.
WHEN WE SAY THE WORD GAY WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT BILLY ENTERING A LONG-TERM
COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP WITH A FARM ANIMAL.
AND THAT'S CRAZY, MAY I REMIND YOU, OLD McDONALD HAD A GOAT.
BUT--  (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE DON'T SAY GAY ISN'T ENOUGH.
WE NEED TO EXPUNG ANYTHING REMOTELY GAY FROM OUR SCHOOLS.
IN ENGLISH CLASS YOU NEED TO STOP TEACHING ANY WORDS THAT EVEN SORT OF SEEM GAY, WORKS
LIKE AMBIENCE AND PERIWINKLE.
AND LET'S NOT FORGET WHILE WE'RE AT IT, HISTORY CLASS IS FULL OF GAY CODE.
HELLO, BATTLE OF THE BULGE?
FOLKS-- WILL THIS MAKE MISSOURI DIFFERENT FROM OTHER STATES?
SURE.
WILL OTHER STATES TEASE THEM FOR THIS PECULIAR DESIRE?
YES.
BUT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN FROM THINKING THAT GAY IS NORMAL, MISSOURI IS
GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOME FREAKY STUFF.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
