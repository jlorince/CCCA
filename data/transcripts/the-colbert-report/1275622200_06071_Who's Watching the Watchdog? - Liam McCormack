WHITE FOR VERY LONG.
NATION, IT IS TAKING A LONG TIME
TO TURN OUR ECONOMIC SHIP
AROUND, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THE
PROPELLER THE CLOGGED WITH OILY
PENGUINS.
[LAUGHTER]
PENGUINS?
THERE ARE PENGUINS IN THE GULF
COAST?
[APPLAUSE]
SURELY...
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE SHOULD TRY
STUFFING PENGUINS DOWN THERE.
THEY'RE PIPE-SHAPED.
FOLKS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS
WAY DOWN, BUT I HAVE A SOLUTION.
POOR-QUALITY PER CHAN DIETION.
THINK OF THE BOOST TO THE
ECONOMY IF INSTEAD OF BUYING ONE
GOOD COFFEE MAKER EVERY FIVE
YEARS, YOU'RE BUYING FIVE CRAPPY
COFFEE MAKERS EVERY ONE
BUT, OF COURSE, THERE ARE
UNPATRIOTIC SOULS WHO VALUE
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY, PEOPLE
WHO REJECT THE CRIES "BUY
AMERICAN."
AND INSTEAD CRY, "DON'T BUY
THAT.
IT WILL SET FIRE TO YOUR
DRAPES."
LIKE THE NERVOUS NELLIES OTHER
OVER AT "CONSUMER REPORTS"
MAGAZINE.
I ASK YOU, IF THEY KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT CONSUMERS WANT, WHY
ARE THEY STILL A MAGAZINE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE LAST THING... YEAH.
THE LAST THING AMERICA NEEDS
RIGHT NOW IS SOME SELF-APPOINTED
WATCHDOG TELLING YOU WHAT'S
WHAT.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM
SELF-APPOINTING ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT'S WHAT.
IN PART ONE OF MY NEW SERIES
"THE COLBERT REPORT'S
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT: WHO IS
WATCHING THE WATCHDOG" TONIGHT'S
TARGET, "CONSUMER REPORTS."
I TRAVELED TO THEIR NATIONAL
TESTING CENTER WHERE I SAT DOWN
WITH HEAD OF TESTING LIAM
McCORMICK.
LIAM.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: MIND IF I CALL YOU
LARRY?
>> I PREFER LIAM.
>> STEPHEN: LARRY, HERE'S MY
PROBLEM.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY DO WE NEED "CONSUMER
REPORTS" TO TELL ME WHAT
PRODUCTS ARE GOOD.
LET THE MARKET DECIDE WHICH
PRODUCTS ARE GOOD.
IF THEY'RE GOOD, PEOPLE BUY A
LOT OF THEM.
CHECKMATE.
>> I THINK THE...
>> STEPHEN: QUICKEST CHECKMATE
I'VE EVER COME.
TO
>> I THINK WE'RE HELPING THE
FREE MARKET.
WE'RE TESTING PRODUCTS USING
VERY SCIENTIFIC PROTOCOLS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT GIVES YOU THE
RIGHT AS A LIMEY BASTARD, NO
OFFENSE, TO TEST AMERICAN
PRODUCTS?
>> WELL, I WORKED IN THE U.K.
FOR AN EQUIVALENT ORGANIZATION
FOR 18 YEARS, SO I'VE BEEN
TESTING PRODUCTS.
>> STEPHEN: WHERE DID YOU WORK?
>> I WORKED FOR "WHICH" MAGAZINE
IN LONDON.
>> STEPHEN: WHICH ONE.
>> "WHICH" MAGAZINE IN LONDON.
>> STEPHEN: I'M ASKING THE
QUESTION.
WHICH MAGAZINE DID YOU WORK FOR?
>> "WHICH" MAGAZINE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S WHAT I'M
ASKING.
>> IT WAS MAGAZINE CALLED
"WHICH."
>> STEPHEN: LET'S MOVE ON.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY DO WE NEED CONSUMER
PROTECTION?
HOW WILL THE CONSUMER EVER GET
STRONGER IF YOU WON'T CUT THE
APRON STRINGS.
>> WE WOULD MUCH RATHER
HIGHLIGHT PRODUCTS WHICH ARE
DEFECTIVE AND UNSAFE BEFORE ANY
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN AT ALL.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT DARWIN'S
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
MAYBE THE FAULTY WIRING IN A
TOASTER MIGHT HARM SOME PEOPLE,
BUT THOSE WHO SURVIVE BECOME
IMMUNE TO ELECTRICITY.
>> I THINK IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED
THAT ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION IS
NOT A GOOD IDEA.
>> Stephen: BY WHOM?
>> I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY DIG
OUT MANY SCIENTIFIC STUDIES...
>> STEPHEN: HAVE YOU EVEN TRIED.
>> WE WOULD RATHER...
>> STEPHEN: HAVE YOU EVEN TESTED
THIS, SIR?
YOU JUST CALLED MY SCIENCE INTO
QUESTION.
HAVE YOU TESTED THIS?
>> WE WOULD MUCH RATHER...
>> STEPHEN: HAVE YOU TESTED
WHETHER OR NOT BEING
ELECTROCUTED BY A TOASTER MAKES
YOU IMMUNE TO ELECTRICITY.
>> WE HAVEN'T PERSONALLY TESTED
THAT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN.
OKAY.
YOU'RE SWIMMING ON A RAFT OVER
THE GRAND CANYON.
THIS METAPHOR IS FULL OF WATER.
>> THINGS ARE BASED ON RIGOROUS
SCIENTIFIC TESTING.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DOES THE
SCIENTIFIC APPROACH SQUARE WITH
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
DISSEMINATING THIS INFORMATION
TO A CHRISTIAN NATION.
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.
>> STEPHEN: I REVIEW PRODUCTS
BASED ON FAITH.
IF MY AIR BAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY,
IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN
THEM HARD ENOUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I WOULD RATHER KNOW MY AIR
BAGS DEPLOYED BASED ON
SCIENTIFIC TESTING.
>> STEPHEN: SO YOU'RE GOING WITH
EINSTEIN ON THIS ONE.
I'LL GO WITH JESUS.
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.
>> ALL CONSUMERS ARE ENTITLED TO
SAFE PRODUCTS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT THE
SETTLEMENT, DO WE HAVE A RIGHT
TO KEEP AND BEAR SAFE GUNS.
>> I DON'T HAVE A VIEW ON THAT.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU TEST GUNS?
>> WE DO NOT TEST GUNS.
>> STEPHEN: WHY DO YOU DRAW THE
LINE AT GUNS?
YOU COULD REALLY HURT SOMEBODY
WITH AN UNSAFE GUN.
>> WE DON'T TEST ANY WEAPONS AT
ALL.
>> STEPHEN: BOWS AND ARROWS?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: KNIVES?
>> KITCHEN FIVES?
>> STEPHEN: KNIVES?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: NUNCHUCKS?
>> NOPE.
>> STEPHEN: YOU DON'T TEST
NUNCHUCKS?
>> WE DON'T TEST ANY WEAPONS.
>> STEPHEN: THERE ARE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT NUNCHUCKS.
THERE ARE THE KIND WITH THE
CHAIN IN THE MIDDLE AND THE KIND
WITH THE CORD IN THE MIDDLE.
>> NOT REALLY THE TYPE OF
PRODUCT WE TEST AT "CONSUMER
REPORTS."
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU TEST CONDOMS?
>> WE DO TEST CONDOMS.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DO YOU DO THAT,
PUT THEM IN A WALLET, LEAVE THEM
THERE FOR THREE YEARS?
>> WE TEST THEM WHETHER THEY ARE
SUFFICIENTLY STRONG IN ORDER TO
OFFER THE PROTECTION THAT YOU
WANT.
>> STEPHEN: AND WHAT'S THE
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF DOGS YOU KILL
WHEN TESTING A PRODUCT?
>> NO ANIMALS ARE HARMED IN OUR
PRODUCT TESTING.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT RABBITS?
>> NO ANIMALS AT ALL.
>> STEPHEN: MONKEYS?
>> WE DO USE CAT FUR IN OUR
VACUUM CLEANER TESTING.
>> STEPHEN: THEN YOU KILL THE
CATS.
>> NO CATS ARE KILLED.
IT'S COMBED OFF THE CATS.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S CHILLING.
YOU'RE THE LARGEEST AUTO TESTING
CENTER IN THE WORLD IS IN
CONNECTICUT.
>> WE PUT CARS THROUGH A TOUGH
PROTOCOL.
STEVEN
>> STEPHEN: WHAT CAR WILL GET ME
LAID.
>> WE TEST HOW SAFE THE CAR IS.
>> STEPHEN: HOW BIG THE BACK
SEAT IS.
>> IF YOU WANT LOTS OF PEOPLE IN
THE BACK SEAT...
>> STEPHEN: I DO.
>> THEN YOU NEED LOTS OF SPACE.
>> STEPHEN: YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT?
LARRY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT?
>> I THINK, YEAH, WHEN IT COMES
TO SPACE IN THE BACK, THAT'S
CLEARLY VERY IMPORTANT,
ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILY CAR.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S GOING TO BE
FAMILY CAR.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> IF IT WORKS FOR YOU, THAT'S
GREAT.
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT
YOU, DO BUT I'LL GIVE YOU THE
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
CAN I GO SEE THE LAB?
>> WE'RE HAPPY TO SHOW YOU
AROUND.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S DO IT.
JOIN US NEXT TIME WHEN I ENTER
THE LAB OF "CONSUMER REPORTS" TO
PUT THE TESTERS TO THE TEST.
IN PART TWO OF "THE COLBERT
REPORT'S INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:
