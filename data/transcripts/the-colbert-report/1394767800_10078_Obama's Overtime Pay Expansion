( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
I'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING OFF MYCHEST.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE FIRSTTIME I'VE SAID THIS, BUT I AM AS
MAD AS A WET HEN.
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M NOTSURE WHAT THAT MEANS.
DOES A HEN HAVE A BURST PIPE INITS COOP.
DID IT SPILL ITS DRINK?
I'M JUST SAYING ONE WOULD THINKAN ANIMAL LIVING IN A DUSTY PEN
WOULD ENJOY A SPLASH OF WATER.
BUT THERE'S NO PLEASING SOMECHICKENS.
THE POINT IS, I'M ANGRY BECAUSEOUR MARXIST-IN-CHIEF HAS
LAUNCHED ANOTHER ATTACK ONAMERICAN BUSINESS.
>> IF YOU'RE MAKING OVER $455 AWEEK YOU DO NOT QUALIFY FOR
OVERTIME.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO CHANGETHE LEVEL WITH HIS EXECUTIVE
ORDER.
SO A LOT MORE PEOPLE WILLQUALIFY FOR OVERTIME.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA FLEXING MOREEXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.
IS SET TO BYPASS CONGRESS ANDORDER THE LABOR DEPARTMENT TO
INSTITUTE CHANGES IN THERULES GOVERNING OVERTIME PAY
TODAY.
>> Stephen:  EMPEROR OBAMA ISISSUING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
BYPASSING CONGRESS BECAUSE THEYWOULDN'T PASS NEW OVERTIME
RULES.
WHY SHOULD THEY?
THEY NEVER WORK OVERTIME.
OR-- OR TIME FOR THAT MATTER.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S DOINGIT.
THERE IS NO REASON ON GOD'SGREEN EARTH TO DO IT BECAUSE THE
SYSTEM WORKS.
CURRENTLY, YOU CAN SPEND 95% OFTHE TIME SWEEPING FLOORS AND
STOCK SHELVES, BUT IF YOU'RERESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISING
PEOPLE 5% OF THE TIME, YOU CANTHEN BE CONSIDERED AN EXECUTIVE
AND BE EXEMPT FROM OVERTIME PAY.
FOLKS, THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
EVEN WHEN YOU STOCK SHELVESYOU'RE MANAGING A LOT OF
PEOPLE-- LITTLE DEBBIE, CHEFBOYARDEE, THE LITTLE DOUGHBOY.
THIS IS NOTHING BUT FORCEDINCOME REDISTRIBUTION.
FOR THAT MATTER, INCOME ISFORCED INCOME REDISTRIBUTION.
( LAUGHTER )AND FOX BUSINESS NEWS' NEIL
CAVUTO HAS A WARNING ABOUT THEHIDDEN DANGER OF PAYING PEOPLE
FOR THEIR WORK.
>> BUSINESSES AND REPUBLICANSSAY IT'S OVERKILL.
DOES HE RISK REWARDING THOSE WHODON'T EVEN DESERVE THOSE BUCKS?
>> Stephen:  YES, YOU STARTPAYING PEOPLE WHO DON'T DESERVE
IT, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,YOU'VE HIRED NEIL CAVUTO.
