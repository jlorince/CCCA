>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS... THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET, I LOVE
OUR TROOPS SO MUCH THAT I WOULD
NEVER JOIN THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE THEN I'D BE CONSTANTLY
GIVING AWAY OUR POSITION BY
YELLING HOW MUCH I LOVE US.
WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO SADDENED
BY TODAY'S NEWS FROM THE FRONT
LINES.
>> AFTER NEARLY TWO DECADES THIS
MORNING, THE BAN ON GAYS AND
LESBIANS IN THE UNITED STATES
MILITARY IS HISTORY.
>> AFTER 18 YEARS OF CONTROVERSY
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" DIED AT
THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT.
>> Stephen: SEE?
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" ENDS AND
IMMEDIATELY MIDNIGHT IS STROKING
IT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THAT I KNOW... NOW THAT I
KNOW THE SUM OF THE... THAT SUM
OF THE TROOPS ARE GAY, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO SUPPORT THEM: FOR
INSTANCE, THE YELLOW RIBBONS.
DOES IT MEAN SOMETHING DIFFERENT
NOW?
IS THAT GAY CODE?
I KNOW WHAT THE BROWN
HANDKERCHIEF MEANS AND WHAT THE
BASEBALL CAP ON THE BELT LOOP
MEANS AND THE TWO FOOT TAPS
UNDER THE BATHROOM STALL AND THE
SHOULDER BUMP AT THE BAR AND THE
EYE CONTACT IN LINE AT THE BANK
AND THE BEST BUY CLERK ASKING ME
IF HE CAN HELP ME BUY FLAT
SCREENS OR THE GUY AT THE DELI
ASKING ME IF I WANT SUGAR IN MY
OF FREE.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU, EVERYONE, I'M
FLATTERED BUT, NO, I DON'T SWING
THAT WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE END OF "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL" HAS FOREVER CHANGED OUR
PERCEPTION OF OUR MILITARY.
SUDDENLY THESE MISSILES LOOK
PHALLIC!
OR WHAT ABOUT THIS SUBMARINE?
OR THIS TANK BARREL?
OR GENERAL RAY ODE AREA SNOW
PLEASE, GENERAL!
POINT THAT THING SOMEWHERE ELSE
OR AT LEAST STOP POLISHING IT.
(LAUGHTER)
IN FACT, ALL WARS SUDDENLY SEEM
KIND OF GAY.
ALL THAT MACHO POSTURING ABOUT
WHO IS INVADING WHO'S FRONT OR
USING THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE TO
FLANK THE ENEMY'S REAR.
EVERYONE'S WEARING PERFECTLY
MATCHING OUTFITS WITH SHINY
SHOES AND HIGH STEPPING.
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
LOOK AT THIS.
IN 1944, NAVY CORPSMAN MELVIN
DWORK WAS EXPELLED FROM THE NAVY
FOR BEING GAY-- THOUGH MR. DWORK
MAY HAVE ALSO VIOLATED THE
NAVY'S POLICY AGAINST BEING A
MAD MAGAZINE CHARACTER.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT LAST WEEK, FOLKS THE
PENTAGON CHANGED MR. DWORK'S
DISCHARGED STATUS FROM
"UNDESIRABLE" TO "HONORABLE"
MAKING HIM ELIGIBLE FOR
LONG-DENIED MILITARY BENEFITS
AND, IN THE PROCESS, MAKING ALL
OF WORLD WAR II HOMOSEXUAL.
TURNING THE GREATEST GENERATION
TO THE GAYEST PENETRATION.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY!
I AM SORRY, TOM BROKAW!
THAT IS NOT ME SAYING THAT, THAT
IS THE PENTAGON!
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON
WORLD WAR I WITH EVERYBODY
HUDDLING DOWN IN EACH OTHER'S
TRENCHES.
AND THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR WITH
THOSE MUSTACHES AND HEADDRESSS.
MESSAGE RECEIVED, OTTO.
(LAUGHTER)
AT THIS POINT, FOLKS, THE ONLY
WAR I CAN THINK OF WITH ZERO GAY
OVERTONES IS THE ONE IN 300.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST A BUNCH OF SHIRTLESS OILED
GREEK DUDES FIGHTING FOR THE
RIGHT TO BE ALL STRAIGHT WITH
EACH OTHER.
(LAUGHTER)
SO, PENTAGON, I AM CALLING ON
YOU TO REVISIT THIS DECISION.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO DOWN IN
HERSELF HISTORY AS THE
ORGANIZATION THAT MADE SETTLING
INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT WITH
STATE-SANCTIONED HOPL SIDE SEEM,
YOU KNOW, KIND OF WEIRD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
