(LAUGHTER)
>> NATION, FEAR IS JUST THE
STATE OF MIND.
BUT THEN AGAIN SO IS MAD-COW
DISEASE.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
THREAT NUMBER THREE,
SUPERMAN, FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE LIKE THE MAN OF
STEAL.
FROM LEAPING TALL BUILDINGS
TO NAILING TERRY HATCHER.
LAST WEEK KAL-EL BROKE MY
HEART.
>> IN THE 900th ISSUE OF
ACTION COMICS, SUPERMAN SAYS,
QUOTE, I INTEND TO SPEAK
BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS
TOMORROW AND INFORM THEM
THAT I IN RENOUNCING MY U.S.
CITIZENSHIP.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
SUPERMAN IS SUPPOSED TO
FIGHT FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE
AND THE AMERICAN WAY.
LIKE USING HIS SUPERSTRENGTH
TO LIFT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST
GULF.
AND THE WORST BETRAYAL HERE
FOLKS, HE IS THROWING AWAY
HIS AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP AT
THE U.N.?
LET'S ALL HOLD HANDS AROUND
THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND
ACHIEVE PEACEFUL COMPROMISE
THROUGH RESOLUTION.
THE GUY'S BASICALLY DENNIS
KUCINICH WITH HEAT VISION.
STOP IT.
STOP IT!
YOU ARE SETTING ON FIRE.
JEEZ.
LOOK AT THAT THING.
FOLKS, WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS EUROIFICATION OF
SUPERMAN COMING.
AFTER ALL HE IS A
70-YEAR-OLD MAN WEARING A
SPEEDO.
THANK GOD, THANK GOD WE HAVE
LUX LUTHOR, JOB CREATOR.
AT A TIME WHEN WE CUT THIS
MAN'S TAXES AND DEREGULATE
HIS KRYPTONITE MINE.
NEXT, FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET.
I LOVE FOOTBALL.
IT'S GOT ALL THE GRACE OF
BALLET EXCEPT EVERYONE IS A
NUT CRACKER.
BUT OUR NATIONAL BLOOD SPORT
IS UNDER ATTACK BY THREAT
NUMBER TWO, MADDEN NFL 12.
THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF
THE POPULAR FRANCHISE HAS A
HORRIFYING NEW FEATURE.
>> MADDEN NFL 12 HAS A NEW
CONCUSSION RULE.
AND IT HAS TAKEN HELMET TO
HELMET HITS AND HEAD FIRST
TACKLING OUT OF THE GAME.
WHERE IF A PLAYER SUFFERS A
CONCUSSION, THEY WILL TAKE
HIM OUT OF THE GAME FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE GAME.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
TAKE HIM OUT OF THE GAME.
NO, YOU PUT THE CON CUSSED
PLAYERS BACK IN.
IT'S THE BRAIN DAMAGED ONES
WHO DON'T FEEL FEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW WORST, EVEN
WORSE, FOLKS, WHEN ARE YOU
TRYING TO CONTINUE THE GAME
WITH YOUR PLAYERS WHOSE
SKULLS HAVE NOT PUSSIED OUT,
THE GAME'S ANNOUNCERS KEEP
YAKKING THAT YOUR PLAYER WAS
REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE
SERIOUSNESS OF HEAD
INJURIES.
FOLKS, WE CANNOT LET REAL
WORLD CONSEQUENCES
INNOVATE-- INVADE OUR
MINDLESS VIDEO GAMES.
WHAT'S NEXT, WHEN I RAM A
POLICE BARRICADE IN GRAND
THEFT AUTO DO I HAVE TO GO
TO TRAFFIC SCHOOL?
IF I PICK UP A PROSTITUTE DO
I HAVE TO PLAY GRAND THEFT
CHLAMYDIA TEST?
I SAY IF ANYTHING, IF
ANYTHING, VIDEO GAMES SHOULD
INFORM OUR REAL LIVES.
ANGRY BIRDS HAS TAUGHT ME A
LOT ABOUT GETTING PIGS OFF
MY ROOF.
IF YOU KNOW A BETTER WAY
THAN LAUNCHING A TERRIFIED
PIGEON FROM A SLING SHOT I'M
ALL EARS.
AND REAL WAR SHOULD BE A LOT
MORE LIKE CALL OF DUTY BLACK
HAWKE.
IN REAL BATTLES PEOPLE DIE.
BUT IMAGINE THE BOOST TO
ENLISTMENT OF FIRE FIGHTS
ENDED WHEN YOUR MOM BRINGS
YOU A SNACK.
FINALLY, FOLKS, I LOVE ALL
THE FOX NETWORKS.
FROM THE SMOKING HOT LADIES
ON FOX NEWS TO THAT SMOKING
HOT LADY ON AMERICAN IDOL.
BUT THERE IS ONE, ONE FOX
SHOW OUT THERE THAT IS
TONIGHT'S THREAT NUMBER ONE.
"GLEE".
FOLKS, FOLKS, I USED TO BE A
GLEEK BUT NOW I AM A
GLOUTSPOKEN GLITIC BECAUSE
"GLEE" IS CLEARLY IN THE
POCKET OF BIG GAY.
FOR MORE WE TURN TO KRIV
HOUSTON'S GAY NEWS LEADER.
>> WHAT THESE TELEVISION
PROGRAMS ARE DOING IS GLAMOR
GLAMORIZING HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR.
GLAMOUR SIZING HOMOSEXUAL
CONDUCT AND WHAT PEOPLE SEE
ON TELEVISION INFLUENCES
THEIR BEHAVIOR AND
INFLUENCES THEIR CHOICES.
>> AND WE ALL NOW ABOUT
PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
YOU THROW A SODA IN A MOVIE
AND WITHIN A FAW SECONDS
EVERYBODY IN THE THESE
CERTIFICATE THIRSTY FOR THAT
PARTICULAR BRAND.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
AND "GLEE" MAKES YOU THIRSTY
FOR GAYS.
AFTER EVERY EPISODE-- I JUST
WANT TO WRAP MY LIPS AROUND
A TALL COOL ONE.
NOW THESE, THESE YOU CAN
SPOT, THE SUBLIMINAL GAY
CODE.
DID YOU CATCH THAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ITS'S SUBTLE BUT
IT'S IN THERE.
FOLKS, "GLEE" IS GLAMORIZING
HOMOSEXUALITY, IT MAKES
BEING GAY LOOK SO GREAT.
>> I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.
>> WELCOME BACK, LADY.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SEE
THAT?
FREE DRINKS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, "GLEE",
I'M NOT FALLING FOR YOUR
PRODUCT PLACEMENTS ANY MORE.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN TRICKED
INTO BUYING YOUR SLUSHEES,
YOUR TRACK SUITS AND YOUR
WHEELCHAIRS.
YOU MAKE BEING PARALYZED
LOOK LIKE SO MUCH FUN.
SO FROM NOW ON I AM ONLY
WATCHING STRAIGHT TV.
LIKE HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.
THAT BARNEY
