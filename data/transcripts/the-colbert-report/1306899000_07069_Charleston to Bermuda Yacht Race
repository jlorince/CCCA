[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
AHOY, LAND LUBBERS.
WELCOME TO THE REPORRRRRRT!
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YE FER JOINING US.
FORGIVE MY GRIZZLED VISAGE AND
HOLLOW, HAUNTED EYES, FOR I HAVE
JUST SAILED SEVEN DAYS ON THE
HEAVING BREAST OF CRUEL POISEDON
IN THE 2011
CHARRRRLESTON-TO-BERMUDA YACHT
RACE!
THERE I BE AT THE HELM.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW I KNOW WHAT LIES BEYOND THE
HORIZON'S SALTY VEIL.
THE BUFFETING WINDS, RAVENOUS
WHALES AS LONG AS TWELVE STOUT
MEN LAID HEAD TO HEEL.
DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
LUCKILY, BEFORE I SET SAIL, I
STEELED MYSELF AGAINST THE
OCEAN'S HORRID MAW BY WATCHING
ALMOST ALL OF "BOAT TRIP."
[LAUGHTER]
FEW HAVE SURVIVED ITS OUTLANDISH
PREMISE.
HOW CAN THEY NOT KNOW THEY'RE ON
A GAY CRUISE?
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THE FILTH, THE EXHAUSTION,
AND FILTH WAS ALL WORTH IT,
BECAUSE.
WE WON THE RACE!
THE RACE TO CoMPSECOND PLACE.
HERE'S THE TRADITIONAL SECOND
PLACE CLOCK.
IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY YOU CAN
HEAR THE HOURS I'LL NEVER GET
BACK SPENT ON THAT FILTHY BOAT.
[LAUGHTER]
THOSE OF YOU WHO FOLLOWED THE
RACE ONLINE, KNOW HOW CLOSE THE
FINISH WAS.
YOU ALSO KNOW THAT THE WEB
TRACKER MADE OUR BOATS LOOK LIKE
SPERM RACING TO FERTILIZE
BERMUDA.
[LAUGHTER]
BEFORE I LEFT, I SAID THAT I WAS
THE GREATEST SAILOR IN THE
WORLD.
SO IT'S WITH GREAT HUMILITY THAT
I MUST NOW ADMIT THAT I AM
MERELY THE SECOND GREATEST
SAILOR IN THE WORLD.
[LAUGHTER]
I WANT TO THANK MY CREW TIM,
BERTIE AND CHRIS, AND ALL OF US
ON TEAM AUDI WANT TO
CONGRATULATE THE WINNER
HANK HOFFORD.
CONGRATULATIONS, HANK.
I WILL MAKE IT MY LIFE'S MISSION
TO HUNT YOU DOWN TILL DEATH OR
MADNESS TAKE ME.
YOU ARE NOW MY WHITE WHALE.
FUDGIE, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
