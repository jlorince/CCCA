FOLKS, ONE OF THE WAYS I'M
KEEPING THE PUBLIC'S EYE ON ME
RIGHT NOW IS SOCIAL MEDIA.
I AM ALL OVER FACEBOOK, MYSPACE,
FOURSQUARE, REDDIT, LINKENDIN,
GOOGLE BUZZ, LIVEJOURNAL,
BLIPPY, TWITTER, TUMBLR, FLIKR,
MUFFLER, FLUMPLER AND, LET'S
SAY, GARGLER.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU SEE, SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE
ONLY WAY TO REACH YOUNG PEOPLE
THESE DAYS WITHOUT GIVING YOUR
ABS A NICKNAME.
AND EVIDENTLY NOBODY LIKES "THE
LAUNDRY SACK."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT, KIDS, KIDS, ALL THIS ONLINE
OPENNESS COMES WITH A PRICE.
>> I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
LET GO FROM THEIR JOB BECAUSE
THEY SHARED A LITTLE BIT TOO
MUCH ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING
ONLINE.
>> IF WE'RE HIRING AN INTERPRET
OR NEW EMPLOYEE, THE FIRST THING
YOU DO IS GO ONLINE AND LOOK AT
THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE.
>> PICTURES OF YOU SHOOTING BACK
TEQUILA SHOOTERS, POLE DANCING,
NOT INFORMATION YOUR EMPLOYER
WANTS TO SEE.
>> Stephen: ESPECIALLY IF
YOU'RE WORKING FOR YOUR DAD.
EVEN BARACK OBAMA KNOWS THE
DANGERS.
>> I WANT EVERYBODY HERE TO BE
CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU POST ON
FACEBOOK.
>> Stephen: AND THE PRESIDENT
HAS BEEN VERY CAREFUL.
I HAVE CHECKED FACEBOOK, AND I
COULD NOT FIND A SINGLE PHOTO OF
HIM PRAYING IN A MOSQUE.
SO I PHOTOSHOPPED ONE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S ON TWITTER.
IT'S ON THE TWITTER, SO,
INTERNET, DO YOUR THING.
THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE NOT
CAREFUL, YOUR ONLINE PAST COULD
DESTROY YOUR OFF-LINE FUTURE.
BUT THERE'S A SOLUTION, AND IT'S
TONIGHT'S "WORD."
CONTROL-SELF-DELETE.
NOW, SOME FOLKS WILL SAY THE
EASIEST WAY TO PROTECT YOUR
PRIVACY IS TO STAY OFF SOCIAL
MEDIA BUT EVEN IF YOU DORK OTHER
PEOPLE CAN POST PICTURES OF YOU
ONLINE.
LUCKILY, LUCKILY GOOGLE C.E.O.
ERIC SCHMIDT HAS A WAY WE CAN
PROTECT OURSELVES.
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU
DON'T WANT ANYONE TO DO, MAYBE
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU LISTENING,
YOUNG PEOPLE?
JUST DON'T EVER MAKE A MISTAKE.
HOW HARD IS THAT?
THE POINT IS...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
THE POINT IS THE INTERNET IS ONE
GIANT RESUME, AND UNDER SPECIAL
SKILLS, YOURS MIGHT LIST,
GETTING HIGH, KEG STANDS,
FLASHING YOUR BOOBS AND
MULTITASKING.
THAT'S WHY ERIC SCHMIDT FURTHER
SUGGESTS THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON
ONE DAY WILL BE ENTITLED
AUTOMATICALLY TO CHANGE HIS OR
HER NAME ON REACHING ADULTHOOD.
EXACTLY.
FROM NOW ON CHANGING YOUR NAME
WILL BE A RITE OF PASSAGE, LIKE
GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE AT
16, DRINKING AT 21 AND
COMPLETING REHAB SO YOU CAN GET
YOUR LICENSE BACK AT 23.
BUT CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY MAY
NOT BE ENOUGH BECAUSE NOW GOOGLE
OFFERS A FACIAL RECOGNITION
FEATURE WHICH CAN IDENTIFY YOU
IN UNLABELED ONLINE PHOTOS.
SO YOU REALLY, YOU REALLY NEED
TO SURGICALLY ALTER YOUR
APPEARANCE.
IT'S EASY.
JUST ASK BRUCE JENNER.
[LAUGHTER]
, NO JIMMY, JIMMY, I SAID BRUCE
JENNER, NOT HIS MOTHER.
OKAY.
BUT EVEN THIS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.
YOU SEE, G-MAIL KEEPS TRACK OF
EVERYONE YOU HAVE EVER E-MAILED,
SO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF YOUR
OLD FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
AND SINCE GOOGLE ALSO TRACKS ALL
YOUR SEARCHES AND WEB HISTORY,
YOU SHOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING YOU
HAVE EVER SEARCHED FOR ON THE
INTERNET.
THEN ONCE ALL THAT'S DONE AND
YOU'RE A DISFIGURED, NAMELESS
LOANER, YOU'LL BE THE IDEAL JOB
CANDIDATE.
OF COURSE...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE OTHER
ANSWER.
GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK COULD STOP
INVASIVELY DATA MINING AND
SELLING OUR PRIVATE LIVES TO THE
HIGHEST BIDDER, BUT THAT WOULD
BE ASKING THEM TO CHANGE WHO
THEY ARE.
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR.
AND THAT
