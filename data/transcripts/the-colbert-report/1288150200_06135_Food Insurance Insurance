EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUMP.
NATION, YOU KNOW, I CONSIDER IT
MY DUTY TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE
APOCALYPSE.
I MAY SCARE THE BEJESUS OUT OF
YOU, BUT I ALSO PROVIDE
TOP-QUALITY RE-BEJESUSING
SERVICES.
RECENTLY I SHARED A FOX
NEWS-VERTIZMENT ABOUT THE
BUNKER, THE $100,000 WAY TO
WEATHER AN ATTACK.
WHAT IF YOU CAN'T GET ON THE
GROUND FLOOR OF HIDING BELOW THE
GROUND FLOOR.
AS WITH EVERY QUESTION YOU'RE
NOT ASKING, GLENN BECK HAS THE
ANSWER.
>> WE LIVE IN A CRAZY WORLD
WHERE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN,
WHETHER IT'S A NATURAL DISASTER
OR A MAN-MADE DISASTERMENTO UH
JUST WANT SOME PEACE OF MIND.
FIRST OF ALL, FOOD INSURANCE.
THEY'RE BACKPACKS.
YOU OPEN UP THE BACKPACKS AND
INSIDE THE BACKPACK IS
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT YOU
NEED FOR FOOD AND WATER.
THIS IS FREEZE-DRIED FOOD, AND
IT WILL LAST YOU A COUPLE WEEKS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
FOOD INSURANCE.
A BAG OF FOOD TO KEEP AROUND
JUST IN CASE THE WORLD COMES TO
AN END BUT WILL BE ALL BETTER IN
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
DON'T GET CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.
JUST LISTEN TO THE BAD NEWS
PANDA.
>> DO THE EASY STUFF NOW.
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR WHAT WE ALL
HOPE WON'T HAPPEN, BUT PROBABLY
WILL.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE
PROBABLY THINKING, FOOD
INSURANCE SOUNDS AMAZING, BUT IS
IT RIGHT FOR ME?
WELL, JUST CHECK THE WEB SITE
HELPFUL DISASTER MAP TO FIND OUT
IF YOUR REGION IS AT RISK FOR
SEVERE STORMS, ECONOMIC
DOWNTURN, FLOODS OR PANDEMICS.
SPOILER ALERT: IF YOU LIVE IN A
REGION, IT IS.
( LAUGHTER )
OF COURSE, IN A POSTAPOCALYPTIC
DISOPEN THIAN HELLSCAPE WHERE
THE LIVING ENVY THE DEAD, WHO
CAN POSSIBLY THINK ABOUT FOOD?
WELL, YOU COULD BECAUSE FOOD
INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE
DELICIOUS.
( LAUGHTER )
IN FACT, THEY PROMISE THAT WHILE
YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE STRUGGLING TO
FIND FOOD, YOU WILL BE DINING ON
LASAGNA AND BEEF STROGANOFF.
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM.
JUST REMEMBER TO SWALLOW BEFORE
DENYING YOUR NEIGHBOR'S CHILD A
BITE OF YOUR STROKE --
STROGANOFF BECAUSE IT'S RUDE TO
TAUNT THE STARVING WITH YOUR
MOUTHFUL, AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
RAISE A TOAST TO YOUR FULL BELLY
WITH YOUR CHOICE OF APPLE DRINK,
ORANGE DRINK OR WHITE MILK
SUBSTITUTE.
MMM.
THAT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR OF MILK
SUBCITY OUT THE.
HUNGRY YET?
WHY NOT SPEND THE EXTRA $10,000
FOR THE DELUXE 12-MONTH FAMILY
OF FIVE AN TRAY PACKAGE
GUARANTEED TO HAVE A 25-YEAR
SHELF LIFE.
WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND
AFFORDABLE FOOD THAT WILL STAY
EDIBLE FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES
OTHER THAN A HALF PI MEAL?
-- HAPPY MEAL?
OF COURSE, EVEN THE BEST FOOD
INSURANCE CAN'T TRULY MAKE YOU
SAFE.
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
VIRUS THAT WIPES OUT MANKIND IS
TRANSMITTED VIA STROGANOFF?
THAT'S WHY I HAVE PARTNERED WITH
THE PRESCOTT GROUP TO OFFER FOOD
INSURANCE, INSURANCE.
IT WILL COVER ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
FOOD INSURANCE FOR A LOW, LOW
MONTHLY PREMIUM OF JUST $8 9.99.
SHOULD THE APOCALYPSE AFFECT
YOUR FOOD INSURANCE, DOWNLOAD
AND PRINT FORM 609B, FILL IT OUT
IN ASH OR BLOOD, THEN MAIL ONE
COPY TO EACH OF OUR SEVEN
PROCESSING CENTERS.
IN TWO TO FOUR MOONCYCLES, A
CLAIMS ADJUSTOR WILL ARRIVE AT
YOUR CRATER, ASSUMING HE CAN
AVOID THE JACKALS.
REMEMBER, WITH GLEN BECK'S FOOD
INSURANCE AND STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FOOD INSURANCE INSURANCE,
AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT MAY END,
