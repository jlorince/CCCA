EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE C.E.O.
OF GOOGLE.
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT IT SAID
WHEN I LOOKED HIM UP ON BING.
PLEASE WELCOME ERIC SCHMIDT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. SCHMIDT, THANKS FOR
COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
I GET TO PUT ANOTHER NOTCH IN MY
BILLIONAIRE BELT.
WONDERFUL TO MEET YOU.
NOW, SIR, YOU ARE THE HEAD OF
GOOGLE, WHICH IS FAST BECOMING
ONE OF THE BIGGEST, MOST
IMPORTANT COMPANIES IN AMERICA.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: HEY, I DIDN'T DO
IT.
YOU GUYS DID IT, YOU AND YOUR
ALGORITHMS, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU MAKE YOUR CASH
BY DOING ESSENTIALLY DATA MINING
ON WHAT WE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT,
RIGHT?
>> NOT TRUE.
>> Stephen: NOT TRUE?
I'M GOING TO GO WITH MY ANSWER.
YOU DO KNOW THINGS ABOUT
AMERICANS THAT WE MAYBE WHEN WE
WERE CHILDREN DIDN'T THINK
PEOPLE WOULD KNOW ABOUT US, OUR
LIKES, OUR DISLIKES, ARE
COTDFIED REGIONALLY IF NOT
INDIVIDUALLY.
>> IT'S TRUE WE SEE YOUR
SEARCHES, BUT WE FORGET THEM
AFTER A WHILE.
>> Stephen: I'M SUPPOSED TO
TRUST YOU?
>> NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IT'S THE
LAW IN ALLY AT COUNTRIES.
>> Stephen: FOR YOU TO FORGET?
>> YOU CAN FORGET IF YOU WANT
TO?
>>
>> Stephen: I TRY TO, IT'S
SCARY.
WHY DO I GET MORE HITS WHEN I
SEARCH TALL WOMEN WITH HEAVY
THINGS.
NO ADS COME UPPER FOR THAT.
>> YOU NEED TO WORK TO GET MORE
CONTENT IN THAT AREA.
>> Stephen: SO YOU WOULDN'T
CALL THAT DATA MINING?
>> WE DON'T DO DATA MINING.
>> Stephen: DA-TA OR DATE-A.
>> WE FIGURE OUT WHAT POINTS TO
EACH OTHER AND THAT GIVES US THE
ALSO RIT, WHICH IS CALLED PAGE
RAFNLG THAT'S HOW WE DECIDE TO
RANK PAGES.
>> Stephen: THIS CHANGED THE
WAY PAGES WERE RANKED.
AT WHAT POINT WILL GOOGLE'S ALGO
RHYTHM BECOME SELF-AWARE AND
TURN ON ITS MASTERS?
>> HOPEFULLY NOT IN OUR
LIFETIME.
IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS ALSO
RHYTHM IS PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.
IT DOES REALLY LARGE THINGS,
ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF INFORMATION.
IT'S WHAT COMPUTERS ARE GOOD
FOR.
HUMANS AREN'T VERY GOOD AT THAT.
>> Stephen: HUMANS AREIN' VERY
GOOD PERIOD.
>> HUMANS ARE NOT VERY GOOD.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY
COMPUTERS WILL EVENTUALLY TAKE
OVER.
>> HUMANS ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT
DEALING WITH BILLIONS OF THINGS,
WHEREAS HUMANS ARE.
AND COMPUTERS ARE NOT DEALING
WITH THINKING THINGS.
>> Stephen: CHINESE ARE GREAT
AT DEALING WITH BILLIONS OF
THINGS.
YOU PULLED OUT OF CHINA.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
>> WE DIDN'T LIKE THEIR LAWS.
>> Stephen: IMMEDIATELY?
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO NOT
LIKE THEIR LAWS?
>> ABOUT FOUR YEARS.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE UNDER THE
YOLK OF COMMUNIST CHINA FOR FOUR
YEARS.
HOW DID YOU GET OUT?
DID YOU TUNNEL YOUR WAY IN
>> WE PROVED.
THERE'S BASICALLY HOW HONG KONG AND
MAINLAND CHINA.
WE LIKE THE HONG KONG SYSTEM
BETTER.
>> Stephen: YOU FAMOUSLY SAID,
AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THIS,
THE IDEA THAT SOME DAY YOUNG
PEOPLE INSTEAD OF HAVING PRIVACY
FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY PUT UP
ON FACEBOOK, BEING ABLE TO
EXPUNGE THAT BECAUSE ONCE IT'S
THERE IT EXIST, SO ONE DAY
THEY'LL ERASE THEIR HISTORY AND
CHANGE THEIR NAMES AND THEY'LL
BE SCOTT-FREE.
>> IT WAS A JOKE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WASN'T VERY GOOD.
>> Stephen: I GUESS THAT'S TOO
HIP FOR THE ROOM.
>> IT WASN'T A VERY GOOD JOKE.
>> Stephen: I WAS ALL FOR IT
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY
ENTICING AS AN EMPLOYER TO GO,
YOU HAVE NO HISTORY AND YOU
CHANGED YOUR NAME YESTERDAY.
WELCOME ABOARD.
>> THE SERIOUS GOAL IS JUST
REMEMBER WHEN YOU POST SOMETHING
THAT THE COMPUTERS REMEMBER
FOREVER.
>> Stephen: WHOSE COMPUTERS,
YOUR COMPUTE CENTERS
>> IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE WEB.
GOOGLE COLLECTS IT.
IT'S ALL OUT ON THE WEB.
WE COLLECT IT.
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD.
IF IT'S REALLY JUICY, THERE WILL
BE COPIES EVERYWHERE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
ABOUT YOU?
>> EVERYBODY HAS PRIVACY.
>> Stephen: NOT ME.
MY LIFE'S AN OPEN BOOK.
>> WELL, WE THINK PRIVACY IS
PRETTY IMPORTANT.
WE'RE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF WE
HAVE ON YOU AND ACTUALLY DELETE
A WHOLE BUNCH OF IT.
>> Stephen: YOUR COMPANY, YOUR
MOTTO IS "DON'T BE EVIL."
RIGHT NOW YOUR STOCK PRICE IS
$513 A SHARE.
HOW LOW WILL THAT HAVE TO GO
BEFOREO GO, THAT'S IT, WE'RE
GOING WITH EVIL.
>> WE'RE NOT...
>> Stephen: YOU'D NEVER BE
EVIL, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: ALL MEN ARE
SINNERS.
>> IT'S A COMPANY.
>> Stephen: COMPANIES ARE
LEGALLY PEOPLE.
WELCOME TO AMERICA.
>> OKAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED ON
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE NOT TO BE
EVIL AND TO DO THE RIGHT THING,
MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
THAT.
SURVIVES ALL OF US.
IT'S OUR PRINCIPLE WE OPERATE
THE COMPANY BY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
COULD YOU HELP ME ERATION MY
BROWSER HISTORY IN
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE IT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN
CHECKING MY SEARCHES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
