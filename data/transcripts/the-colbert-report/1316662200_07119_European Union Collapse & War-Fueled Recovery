HOUR-LONG EPISODE.
AND ONCE THE RADIOHEAD GETS
HERE, HE MIGHT NEVER GO BACK TO
ENGLAND BECAUSE THE E.U. IS ON
THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE.
>> THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF IS
FALLING APART AND FAST.
>> THE GREAT WEAKNESS IS
OBVIOUSLY GOVERNMENTS LIKE
GREECE, IF THEY WERE TO DEFAULT,
YOU WOULD HAVE COLLAPSE OF THE
CURRENCY AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS.
>> IF THE EURO COLLAPSES, EUROPE
COLLAPSES.
>> Stephen: AND IF EUROPE
CLANSES, WHERE WILL COLLEGE
STUDENTS SPEND A SEMESTER ABROAD
TO LEARN HOW TO THROW UP SANGRIA
IN SPANISH?
NOW, THE COLLAPSE IS IMMINENT
BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN GREECE IS IN
DANGER OF DEFAULTING ON THEIR
DEBT.
AND TO SAVE THEMSELVES, THEY
HAVE ONLY TWO OPTIONS.
A, THE PRIME MINISTER CAN TURN
GREECE'S CREDITORS TO STONE BY
USING MEDUSA'S HEAD.
OR, B, GREECE CAN CONVINCE THE
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR FINANCIAL
HOUSE IN ORDER, BUT TO DO THAT,
SOMEONE IN GREECE MAY HAVE TO DO
THE UNTHINKABLE -- GET A JOB.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME EXPLAIN, GREEKS.
A JOB IS WHEN YOU PROVIDE A
SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR
SOMETHING CALLED MONEY.
ASK ITALY.
WAIT, DON'T ASK ITALY.
NOW, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY
PRINTING LOTS OF MONEY, BUT
GERMANY DOESN'T WANT TO BECAUSE
AFTER WORLD WAR ONE, THEY
PRINTED SO MUCH CURRENCY THAT
INFLATION EXPLODED AND JUST TO
BUY A LEFT OF BREAD, PEOPLE HAD
TO FILL A WHEELBARROW WITH
MONEY.
IRONICALLY, THE PRICE OF A
WHEELBARROW WAS AN OX CART FULL
OF BREAD.
[LAUGHTER]
FLG THIS ECONOMIC CHAOS BROUGHT
ABOUT THE RISE OF THE NAZI
PARTY, SO BASICALLY GERMANY IS
SAYING TO THE REST OF EUROPE,
WE'RE MILD-MANNERED BRUCE BANNER
NOW, BUT IF WE'RE EXPOSED TO THE
GAMMA RAYS OF INFLATION, WE
COULD BECOME FASCIST HULKS.
[LAUGHTER]
DON'T MAKE ME HITLER.
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME WHEN I'M
HITLER.
AND FOR SOME REASON POLAND TAKES
GERMANY'S "WE MIGHT BECOME
NAZIS" THING PRETTY SERIOUSLY.
THEIR FINANCE MINISTER SAID THIS
CRISIS COULD LEAD THE WAR IN TEN
TO 20 YEARS.
TEN TO 20 YEARS.
AND THAT'S IN CELSIUS.
FOLKS, EUROPE HAS BEEN TORN
APART BY WAR SO MANY TIMES, AND
FOR IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN WOULD BE
SO WONDERFUL.
BECAUSE WORLD WAR II IS WHAT GOT
AMERICA OUT OF THE GREAT
DEPRESSION.
U.S. MANUFACTURING SOARED,
UNEMPLOYMENT PLUNGED, AND
TONGUING STRANGERS IN TIMES
SQUARE REACHED RECORD HIGHS, BUT
TEN TO 20 YEARS I BELIEVE IS TOO
LONG THE WAIT, SO LET ME JUST
PRIME THE PUMP A LITTLE BIT.
EVERYONE KNOWS THE FASTEST WAY
TO START A EUROPEAN WAR IS TO
PISS OFF THE KRAUTS.
SO LET'S GIVE THEM A REAL IT CAN
IN THE SCHNITZELS.
HEY, GERMANY, BELGIAN'S EUROPEAN
AFFAIRS OFFICIAL SAYS YOU LACK
SOLIDARITY AND SHOULDN'T BE
TELLING OTHER NATIONS WHAT TO
DO, ADDING, "I BET YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE THE BALLS TO INVADE US
AGAIN."
AND HEY, DEUTSCHLAND, ENGLAND'S
FORMER PRIME MINISTER GORDON
BROWN SAID, "IT IS ALSO TIME FOR
GERMANY TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT MUST
BE INTEGRAL TO SOLVING THE
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN
INTEGRAL TO THE PROBLEM ITSELF."
SLAM.
SUPER CALL FRAGILIST YOUR
COUNTRY IS ATROCIOUS.
GERMANY, YOU JUST GOT YOUR ASS
SERVED TO YOU, AND IN ENGLAND
THAT'S A BREAKFAST MEAT.
AND BRACE YOURSELF, FATHER LAND,
ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER SILVIO
BERLUSCONI WAS OVERHEARD SAYING,
AND THIS IS AN ACTUAL QUOTE,
THAT GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA
MERKEL IS AN "[BLEEPED] LARD
ASS."
AND THAT, THAT IS FROM A GUY WHO
WOULD HAVE SEX WITH A FOUR-SLOT
TOASTER IF IT WERE UNDER 18.
SO LET THE WAR-FUELED RECOVERY
BEGIN.
DIG UP THE ANDREWS SISTERS, LOCK
UP THE JAPANESE AND START
HOARDING TIN BECAUSE THIS IS THE
ONLY ANSWER TO
