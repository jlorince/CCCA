>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS
AMERICA'S UN AMBASSADOR,
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T SPEAK
UNESE.
PLEASE WELCOME SUSAN WRIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
NOW THAT LITTLE GREETING I
GAVE THE AUDIENCE CHEERING
FOR ME, DID THAT REMIND YOU
OF ANY DICTATORS OR MAD MEN
WHO COME SPEAK AT THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
A HUGO CHAVEZ FEEL?
>> EVERY SEPTEMBER WE HAVE A
BIT OF A SIDESHOW.
SOMETIMES IT FEELS A LITTLE
LIKE THE STAR WARS BAR SCENE
WHERE SOME OF THE MOST
COLOURFUL DICTATORS OF THE
WORLD WILL COME AND GIVE
THEIR SPEECHES BUT MOST OF
THE YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY A
PRETTY SERIOUS PLACE WHERE
WE GET A LOT OF GOOD WORK
DONE FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
>> SO THE THEY ARE UP THERE,
JUST GOING-- THAT'S THAT
WHITE-- WHAT IS PLAYING IN
THE WHITEHEAD PHONE OF
YOURS.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE
SPEECH.
>> NOW YOU ARE THE OFFICIAL
TITLE, YOU ARE THE U.S.
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO
THE UNITED NATIONS.
>> I THINK THAT'S CORRECT.
>> YOUR PREDECESSOR WAS JOHN
BOLTON.
>> YES.
>> HE OF THE WALRUSY
MUSTACHE.
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO FOLLOW
JOHN BOLTON.
DOW STILL FIND WHISKERS IN
THE MICROPHONE?
HE SAID THAT THE U.N. COULD
LOSE ITS TOP TEN FLOORS AND
NO ONE WOULD NOTICE.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE
U.N. TODAY?
>> WELL, STEPHEN, WE
ACTUALLY LIVE IN A PRETTY
DANGEROUS AND COMPLICATED
WORLD.
>> Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW.
>> AND MANY OF THE THREATS
WE FACE TERRORISM,
PROLIFERATION, DISEASE,
CLIMATE CHANGE, GENOCIDE,
ARE NOT THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT ONE COUNTRY, EVEN ONE
AS POWERFUL AS OUR OWN CAN
SOLVE BY ITSELF.
SO WE NEED COOPERATION.
WE NEED COUNTRIES WORKING
TOGETHER.
AND THE U.N. IS THE ONE
PLACE ON THE PLANET, DESPITE
IT'S MANY FLAWS WHERE WE CAN
MARSHAL THE SUPPORT AND
SHARE THE COSTS OF DOING
WHAT'S NECESSARY TO PROTECT
THE UNITED STATES.
SO IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT BUT
ACTUALLY A PLACE WHERE WE
GET A LOT DONE FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> IT IS FAR FROM PERFECT.
OKAY.
>> DON'T WORRY.
I'M GOING TO NAIL HER.
NOW LISTEN.
ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT,
OKAY.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
BUT AT WHAT PRICE?
WHY ARE YOU WILLING TO
SURRENDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF
THE UNITED STATES TO THE
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WHO GET
TO COME IN AND SAY WHAT WE
CAN OR CANNOT DO.
BECAUSE THERE ARE WELL-KNOWN
PLANS TO DROP BLUE HELMETED
PARA TROOPERS INTO THE
UNITED STATES TO ESTABLISH A
GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE
GOVERNMENT AND TO TAKE AWAY
OUR GUNS.
WILL YOU ADMIT THAT?
>> NO.
>> WILL YOU NOT ADMIT THAT.
>> IN FACT, LET ME TELL YOU
HOW IT REALLY WORKS.
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL
CAN'T EVEN ISSUE A PRESS
STATEMENT WITHOUT THE UNITED
STATES'S AGREEMENT.
THEY DON'T TAX US.
>> I'M NOT SAYING ARE YOU
NOT ON BOARD WITH IT.
I'M SAYING YOU GUYS ARE ON
BOARD WITH IT.
YOU GUYS IN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WOULD LOVE
THE U.N. THE EXCUSE TO TAKE
AWAY OUR GUNS.
>> NOT AT ALL.
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A
BLACK HELICOPTER THERE ARE
NO SUCH THINGS AT PARA
TROOPERS WEARING BLUE
HELMETS.
WE GET TO DECIDE WHAT WE DO,
WHEN WE DO IT.
NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN SERVES
UNDER U.N. COMMAND.
ALL OF THE STUFF ABOUT
SOVEREIGNTY IS ONE BIG
MYTHMENT BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS
THAT WE HAVE OTHERS PAYING
THE BULK OF THE BILLS FOR
IMPORTANT MISSIONS THAT
OTHERWISE EITHER WE WOULD
HAVE TO DO OURSELVES OR
WOULDN'T GET DONE.
SO HERE-- .
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
OR ARE NOT AND EXCUSE ME FOR
INTERRUPTING YOU, BUT I
ENJOY IT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT
THERE ON THE PERMANENT
SECURITY COUNCIL.
WE GOT U.S., FRANCE, U.K.,
CHINA AND RUSSIA.
OKAY, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE
WHO CAN VETO ANYTHING,
RIGHT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW YOU CAN GET
ANYTHING DONE WHEN YOU GOT
CHINA AND RUSSIA ON THIS
THING.
WHO ARE OUR SWORN ENEMIES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THEIR COMMUNIST
COUNTRIES.
HOW YOU CAN GET ANYTHING
DONE?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, STEPHEN,
IT WAS WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA
ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT
WE WERE ABLE TO IMPOSE TOUGH
SANCTIONS ON IRAN, ONE OF
THEIR MAJOR TRADING
PARTNERS.
ON NORTH KOREA.
>> Stephen:  -- --.
>> THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR
QUESTION IS THAT UNDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA THE UNITED
STATES HAS REPAIRED
RELATIONSHIPS, REPAIRED
FREYED ALLIANCES AND WORKED
TO RESET WHAT HAD BEEN
FRAUGHT AND DIFFICULT
RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE OR
COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA.
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO MOVE THEM MORE
OFTEN THAN NOT TO POSITIONS
THAT REFLECT OUR INTERESTS,
OUR VALUES AND OUR
OBJECTIVES SUCH AS
SANCTIONING IRAN.
SUCH AS SANCTIONS NORTH
KOREA.
SUCH AS FIGHTING
NONPROLIFERATION GLOBALLY.
SUCH AS SUPPORTING --
>> KOREA GOT THEIR NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
I'M JUST AS SCARED AS BOTH
OF THESE PEOPLE.
HOW ARE WE STOPPING THEM?
I MEAN I KNOW STERNLY WORDED
LETTERS ARE THE BREAD AND
BUTTER OF THE U.N. BUT MAYBE
WE SHOULD START TYPING THEM
IN ALL CAPS.
LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE
REALLY ANGRY.
>> WITH EXCLAMATION.
>> GO AHEAD.
IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO
IRAN FOR EXAMPLE, THE
SANCTIONS THAT WERE IMPOSED
HAVE WEAKENED THE BANKING
SECTOR.
WEAKENED THEIR ABILITY TO
REQUIRE INSURANCE.
HAVE LEAD TO A DIM ANYTHING
OF THE IRANIAN ECONOMY.
AND THEY ARE NOW UNDER
PRESSURE, INCREASINGLY
ISOLATED IN A REGION WHERE
THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS
TURNING TO THEIR
DISADVANTAGE, WITNESS SYRIA.
AND THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS
COME TOGETHER TO PAGE IT
VERY CLEAR WITH ECONOMIC
PRESSURE THAT THE NUCLEAR
PROGRAM THEY'RE PURSUING IS
ILLEGAL AND OUGHT TO BE
STOPPED.
>> Stephen: ACCOUNT U.N. DO
ANYTHING TO MAKE AHMADINEJAD
WEAR A TIE?
CAN YOU GET A RESOLUTION ON
THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WOULD THAT BE APPEALING.
>> Stephen: IT WOULD BE A
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
>> I TELL YOU WHAT.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE
A COMMERCIAL BREAK BUT WILL
YOU STICK AROUND AND WE'LL
TALK ABOUT WHAT AS BECOME OF
THE ARAB SPRING.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK WITH MORE FROM
AMBASSADOR SUSAN WRIGHT.
