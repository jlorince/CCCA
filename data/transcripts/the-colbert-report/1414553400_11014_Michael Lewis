UNIVERSE.

SO YOUR QUESTION IS?
>> Stephen: WHAT HAS CHANGEDON WALL STREET OR HAS ANYTHING
CHANGED?
>> NOT MUCH.
I TELL YOU WHAT'S CHANGED, IT'SGOTTEN MUCH BETTER AT DISGUISING
WHAT IT'S DOING, AND IT'S HARDERTO UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE
OUTSIDE THAN IT WAS.
>> Stephen: COMPUTERS DO A LOTOF THE TRADING NOW, DON'T THEY?

>> Stephen: DO THEY DO MOST OFTHE COCAINE, TOO?
(APPLAUSE)>> JUST THE STRIPPERS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A VERY, LIKE, JAUNDICEDVIEW OF WALL STREET.
YOU WORKED THERE -->> I DON'T THINK I HAVE A
JAUNDICED VIEW.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T?
NO, I HAVE -- WELL, WHEN IWORKED THERE, I HAD KIND OF A
LOVING VIEW OF IT.
>> Stephen: THEN WHY DID YOULEAVE, BABY?
COULDN'T RUN WITH THE BIG DOGS?
WHY DID YOU GET OUT?
TOO HOT FOR YOU?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE?
>> I THINK I WASN'T VERY GOOD ATIT, TO START WITH.

CRITICIZING IT.

WALL STREET PERSON.

YOU HAVE A VERY CLEAR OPINION OFIT.
>> Stephen: YOUR ELIZABETHWARRENS OUT THERE SAY THE STOCK
MARKET IS RIGGED.
>> I SAID IT FIRST.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
FLASH BOYS IS ABOUT THIS.
I THINK THE STOCK MARKET ISRIGGED.
IT'S A VERY WEIRD MARKET.COMPUTERS ARE DOING THE TRADING
BUT SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS GETTO SEE THE PRICES BEFORE OTHERS,
PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS AND YOURCOMPUTER SEES THE PRICES
LAST.
>> Stephen: HOW DO I GET ONEOF THOSE OTHER COMPUTERS?
>> IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY ANDYOU NEED TO KNOW PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: DOES ANYBODY KNOWHOW WALL STREET WORKS?
DOES ANYBODY KNOW?
BECAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I LOOK AT, LIKE, THE NEWS --THIS IS MY SYMBOL FOR NEWS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: I LOOK AT ALL THENEWS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
THE DOW IS AT 17,005. THAT'SWHAT IT CLOSED AT TODAY.
17,005 DOW POINTS, DOW LINKS.WHATEVER THOSE ARE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WHATEVERTHOSE ARE.
IS THAT GOOD FOR ME THAT IT ISTHERE AT 17-5?
>> DO YOU OWN SOME OF IT?
>> Stephen: I THINK SO.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S A VERYNICE THING.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH!
>> Stephen: AREN'T I GETTINGRIPPED OFF BY THE GUYS WHO GET
THERE FIRST?
>> YEAH BUT WHEN YOU TRADE INTHE MARKET, IT'S PENNIES. THE
BEAUTY OF THE RIGGING IS YOUDON'T FEEL IT MUCH IF YOU'RE
JUST AN ORDINARY PERSON.
>> Stephen: REALLY? SO THEY'RESHAVING THE SKIN OFF MY BACK,
SO LITTLE THAT I  FEEL LIKE IT'SJUST DERMABRASION?
>> IT'S LIKE A PARTIAL ENEMA.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE A PARTIALENEMA?
YEAH.
>> Stephen: JUST ENOUGH!
IT JUST FEELS CLEANSING!
