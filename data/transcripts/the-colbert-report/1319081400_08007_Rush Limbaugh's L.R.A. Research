>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, THANKS, FOLKS.
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, I COME OUT
HERE AND I NAIL IT.
BUT WHEN I COMES TO TRUE
PUNDITRY, I STAND ON THE
SHOULDERS OF GIANTS, LIKE RUSH
LIMBAUGH.
ACTUALLY, I STAND ON HIS BACK
PAUNCH.
HIS SHOULDERS ARE A LITTLE
SLOPE-Y.
BUT ONCE AGAIN, FOLKS, EL RUSHBO
WAS THE ONLY ONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO
CRITICIZE BARACK OBAMA, THIS
TIME FOR SENDING U.S. TROOPS
INTO UGANDA TO FIGHT A GUERRILLA
GROUP CALLED THE LRA OR THE
LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY.
>> LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY ARE
CHRISTIANS.
THEY ARE FIGHTING THE MUSLIMS.
LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY
OBJECTIVES, I HAVE THEM HERE: TO
REMOVE DICTATORSHIP AND STOP THE
OPRESSION OF OUR PEOPLE.
NOW, AGAIN, LORD'S RESISTANCE
ARMY IS WHO OBAMA HAS SENT
TROOPS TO HELP NATIONS WIPE OUT,
WIPE OUT CHRISTIANS.
>> STEPHEN: OBAMA IS WIPING
OUT CHRISTIANS.
HE'S NOT ONLY A SECRET MUSLIM,
HE'S A SECRET LION.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, FOLKS, TURNS OUT, TURNS
OUT -- THANKS VERY MUCH.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS CLEVER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, FOLKS, THERE'S ACTUALLY A
FUNNY STORY HERE.
TURNS OUT LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY
IS KIND OF A QUIRKY WAY OF
LOVING THY NEIGHBOR.
>> IS THAT RIGHT, LORD'S
RESISTANCE ARMY IS BEING ACCUSED
OF REALLY BAD STUFF, CHILD
KIDNAPPING, TORTURE, MURDER,
THAT KIND OF STUFF.
WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS
TODAY, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR
DUE DILIGENCE RESEARCH ON IT.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.
DUE DILIGENCE, DUE DILIGENCE
ALWAYS COMES AFTER ACCUSING THE
PRESIDENT OF KILLING CHRISTIANS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHY... THAT'S WHY,
FOLKS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED
"RE-SEARCH."
IF YOU DO IT BEFORE, IT'S CALLED
"PRE-SEARCH."
AND RUSH DID SOME PRE-SEARCH.
FOR INSTANCE, EVERYTHING HE READ
ABOUT THE LRA HE GOT FROM THE
WIKIPEDIA ENTRY ON THE GROUP'S
IDEOLOGY.
IT'S ALSO WHERE RUSH LEARNED
THAT THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY
BROKE UP REM AND PLAYED BOOGER
IN "REVENGE OF THE NERDS."
NOW, FOLKS, SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY
RUSH SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A
LITTLE MORE BEFORE ACCUSING THE
PRESIDENT OF SLAUGHTERING
CHRISTIANS, BUT AS A
BROADCASTER, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
TO TRUST WHAT AN ORGANIZATION
SAYS ABOUT ITSELF ON THE
INTERNET.
THAT IS WHY, AND I JUST FOUND
THIS OUT, THIS IS WHY I CANNOT
BELIEVE THAT OBAMA IS AGAINST
ANOTHER CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION
WHOSE STATED OBJECTIVE IS "A
HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT, CHILDREN'S
WELFARE AND FREEDOM OF BELIEF
WITHOUT FEAR."
AMEN, BROTHER.
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE DO I SEND THE DONATION
CHECK?
OKAY.
THE AMERICAN NAZI PARTY.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
OKAY.
OKAY.
WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THESE
NAZIS, AND I HOPE I'M
PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY.
WE WILL, OF COURSE, DO DUE
DILIGENCE RESEARCH ON THAT AND
INVESTIGATE THE NASTY RUMORS
CIRCULATING ABOUT THESE FOLKS.
BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE
FACT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER
ORGANIZATION OUR THERE THAT
OBAMA HAS REPEATEDLY ATTACKED.
I BELIEVE THEY HAVE EXCELLENT
CORE VALUES.
LISTEN TO THIS, "WE BELIEVE VERY
SIMPLY THAT IT IS THE ACTIONS OF
INDIVIDUALS WORKING TOGETHER
THAT BUILDS STRONG COMMUNITIES."
I LOVE THAT.
I DON'T CARE WHO SAID IT, NAZI,
COMMIES, THE KLAN, I STAND BY
THE BANK OF AMERICA.
OH, MY GOD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OH, NO.
JIMMY, JIMMY, PLEASE, WE GOT TO
EDIT THIS OUT THAT.
THAT IS A CAREER ENDER.
THEY HAVE BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
GET IT OFF.
GET IT OFF!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
