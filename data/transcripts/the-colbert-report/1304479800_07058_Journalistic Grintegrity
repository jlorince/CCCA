>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, NATION --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE THE
COMMERCIAL BREAK UNLIKE BIN
LADEN'S HEAD OBAMA NOW SEEMS
INSTKRUSIBLE -- DESTRUCTIBLE.
HE HAS A WEAKNESS, THE SKY
ROCKETING PRICE OF GASOLINE
AMERICA'S FAVORITE FLUID.
>> GAS PRICES INCHING UP.
>> THE PRICE OF FILLING UP YOUR
GAS TANK WENT UP FER OVERNIGHT.
>> STUNNED MOTORISTS DISCOVERED
GAS PRICES TOPPING $4 A GALLON.
>> WORD IS WE MAY SEE $6 A
GALLON GAS THIS SUMMER.
>> Stephen: I DO NOT LIKE MY
FUEL BEING MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
MY BOXED WINE.
[LAUGHTER]
LUCKILY THERE'S A RAINBOW IN
THIS GAS PUDDLE.
>> HIGHER GAS PRICES ARE A
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE
PRESIDENT'S DROPPING POLL
NUMBERS.
>> YES, ESPECIALLY SINCE
APPROVAL RATING BAR GRAPHS ARE
ACTUALLY GAS POWERED.
WE HAVE FINALLY FOUND OBAMA'S
WEAKNESS, FOLKS.
THINGS HE CAN'T CONTROL.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE DESPITE GAS PRICES BEING
DETERMINED BY OUTSIDE FACTORS
LIKE SUPPLY LEVELS,
SPECULATIONS, SUMMER DEMAND AND
UNCERTAINTY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
IT FEELS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOWER OIL
PRICES BY DOING THIS.
>> SAUDI ARABIA SAID LET'S RISE
RISE -- RAISE THE PRICE AND CUT
BACK PRODUCTION.
THEY WANT TO RAISE THE PRICE OF
OIL BECAUSE WE HAVE NOBODY IN
WASHINGTON THAT SITS BACK AND
SAYS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE
THAT (bleep) PRICE, YOU
UNDERSTAND ME?
>> Stephen: THANK YOU GOLDEN
HELMETED NOISE WARRIOR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
I KNOW WHENEVER I YELL AT A
WAITER TO GET MY STEAK RIGHT OR
I'LL PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE, IT
ALWAYS COMES BACK DELICIOUS AND
CERTAINLY MORE MOIST.
[LAUGHTER]
AS MUCH AS I ENJOY HOW HIGH GAS
PRICES ARE HURTING OBAMA PEOPLE
ARE SUFFERING.
SO WHEN REPORTING THE NEWS IT'S
IMPORTANT TO STRIKE THE RIGHT
BALANCE LIKE THEY DO ON FOX
NEWS.
>> ENERGY PRICES ALL FORMS OF
ENERGY UP 16% IN THE PAST YEAR.
GAS UP NEARLY 30% THAT IS MAYBE
A BIG PROBLEM FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION.
>> DO HIGH GAS PRICES TRANSLATE
TO GOOD NEWS FOR THE G.O.P.
>> ONCE THE PRICES GO UP THEY
NEVER COME BACK DOWN DO THEY
AMERICA?
>> SOMETIMES.
>> SELDOM IF EVER.
>> Stephen: WHOA PEOPLE HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FOOD AND GAS.
CLASSIC.
[LAUGHTER]
FOX NEWS HAS MADE A BIG
BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIELD OF
REPORTING GRIM NEWS WHILE BEING
DELIGHTED IT WILL HURT THE
PRESIDENT.
I'M FOLLOWING THEIR LEAD WITH A
NEW SEGMENT I CALL JOURNALISTIC
GRIN-TEGRITY.
AFTER FALLING FOR FOUR STRAIGHT
MONTHS UNEMPLOYMENT SHOT UP BY
40,000 CLAIMS LAST WEEK.
IN FACT THINGS ARE SO GRIM
McDONALDS TURNED AWAY OVER
900,000 APPLICANTS.
THAT MEANS IF YOU STUDY HARD,
GET GOOD GRADES AND GOOD TO
COLLEGE IT STILL DOESN'T QUALIFY
YOU TO FLIP BURGERS.
SPEAKING OF OMINOUS ECONOMIC
NEWS, CONGRESS MAY NOT RAISE THE
DEBT CEILING, SEND AMERICA INTO
DEFAULT AND THEN DESTROY OUR
CREDIT RATING TURNING OUR ONCE
GREAT NATION IN NOOA A -- INTO A
LAWLESS PLACE MADE OF NOTHING
BUT HUMAN BLOOD AND BABY CREEPS.
FEDERAL OFFICIALS WARN THAT
OSAMA BIN LADEN'S DEATH WILL
INSPIRE TERROR ATTACKS THE
HORROR OF WHICH IS UNIMAGINABLE.
WE MAY NEVER KNOW A FEELING OF
JOY AGAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL THAT'S -- MMMMM.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THAT IS IT FOR
JOURNALISTIC GRIN-TEGRITY.
JOIN ME NEXT TIME
