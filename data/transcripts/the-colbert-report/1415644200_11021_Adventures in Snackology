(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
THANKS SO MUCH!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, TONIGHT I COME TO YOUWITH NEWS OF A
SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH GIVINGMILLIONS OF AMERICANS HOPE FOR A
BETTER TOMORROW.
I SIT HERE AS EYEWITNESS TOHISTORY, PRIVILEGED TO SAY THE
FOLLOWING WORDS -- MOUNTAIN DEWNOW TASTES LIKE DORITOS.
JIM?
>> PEPSI AND FRITO-LAY HAVETEAMED UP TO CREATE
DORITOS-FLAVORED MOUNTAIN DEW.
THE NEW SODA IS CALLED DEWITOSAND IS NOW BEING TASTE-TESTED ON
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
>> Stephen: YES, FOODSCIENTISTS ARE USING UNDERGRAD
LAB RATS TO TEST A NEWDORITO-MOUNTAIN DEW HYBRID.
YOU WERE RIGHT, STONERS --
FRITO-LAY CAN HEAR YOURTHOUGHTS!
(LAUGHTER)FINALLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION --WHAT IF MY DORITOS WERE WET
AND CAFFEINATED? WHAT WOULD THATTASTE LIKE?
>> KENT STATE FRESHMAN STEVEBARNES TASTED DEWITOS SODA AT
THE OHIO COLLEGE RECENTLY.
HE DESCRIBES IT AS LIKE ORANGEWITH A NACHO CHEESE AFTERTASTE.
>> Stephen: MAKES SENSE.
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN DORITOSIS "AFTERTASTE."
NOW, THANKS TO PEPSI CO.
INNOVATORS, THOSE WHO WANT TODRINK THEIR NACHO NO LONGER HAVE
TO FIND THE A.M.C. CONCESSIONSTAND WHERE NOBODY'S WATCHING
THE CHEESE PUMP. FOLKS, I GOTTASAY,
I'LL ADMIT, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,BUT
I ONCE WAS A DEW DOUBTER.
I NEVER THOUGHT MOUNTAIN DEWWOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE
COLD FUSION.
BUT, BOY, DID I SLURP MY WORDS.
AND NOW PEPSICO HAS MADE GOODON THEM ACTUAL 2012 PROMISE TO,
QUOTE, TAKE FOODS AND DRINKIFYTHEM.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)HOW FITTING.
MY FAVORITE TIME TO EAT DORITOSIS WHEN I'M DRUNKIFIED.
(LAUGHTER)AND WITH DEW-ITOS NOW A
REALITY, MANKIND IS APPROACHINGTHE LONG-PREDICTED SNACK
SINGULARITY -- THE SNACKULARITY,IF YOU WILL.
(LAUGHTER)IN WHICH FOOD SCIENTISTS ACHIEVE
A UNITY OF ALL FLAVORS.
DRINKS THAT TASTE LIKE CHIPS,CHIPS THAT TASTE LIKE DIPS.
WE ARE ALL FLAVORNAUTS,EXPLORING THE OUTER REACHES OF
THE MILKY WAY.
WHICH IS NOW AVAILABLE AS ANASAL SPRAY. THAT'LL WAKE YOU UP
(LAUGHTER)BUT EVEN MORE PROFOUND, THE DAWN
OF DEW-ITOS BRINGS US TO THEVERY INTERSECTION OF SCIENCE AND
SPIRITUALITY, AND OPENS THETASTEBUDS TO AN INFINITE FOOD
COURT OF THE MIND, KNOWN TO THEBUDDHISTS AS THE
THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD GORDITA.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE BUDDHAWOULD HAVE POUNDED THAT THING!
(LAUGHTER)SO I SALUTE THE SNACKOLOGISTS
WHO PIONEERED THIS DEWITOSBREAKTHROUGH.
UNTIL NOW, TO GET THIS FLAVORCOMBO, YOU'D HAVE TO CONSUME
MOUNTAIN DEW AND DORITOSSEPARATELY AND THEN THROW UP IN
YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE.
(LAUGHTER)JUST A LITTLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BY THE WAY, THAT WOULD BE A
GREAT SLOGAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
