>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN IWAS A LITTLE KID AND I NEEDED A
QUESTION ANSWERED I ALWAYS USEDTO TURN TO MY FAVORITE FAMILY
MEMBER, TV.
(LAUGHTER)IT ANSWERED ALL THE BIG
QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENINGAND WHO'S THE BOSS AND HOWDY
DOODY!
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO USE TV TOANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN MY
WEEKLY VIEWER MAIL SEGMENT THATI DO TWICE A YEAR.
IT'S TIME TO CHECK THE INBOX.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S TODAY'S VIEWER LETTER.
WHERE WE GO -- HERE YOU ARE.
DEAR STEPHEN, WHICH IS THESUPERIOR SANDWICH THE B.L.T. OR
THE CLUB.
PLEASE SETTLE THIS, I'VE GOT ALOT OF MONEY RIDING ON IT,
SINCERELY POPE FRANCIS, THEVATICAN.
OKAY, YOUR HOLINESS, NOW I'VEAVOIDED THIS FOR YEARS BECAUSE
B.L.T. VERSUS CLUB IS THETHIRD-RAIL OF SANDWICH POLITICS.
A CONFLICT THAT DATES BACKCENTURIES, LIKE ISRAEL AND
PALESTINE -- IF JEWS AND MUSLIMSCOULD EAT EITHER SANDWICH.
BUT OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T IGNORE THECONTROVERSY ANY LONGER,
SO LET'S SINK OUR TEETH INTOTHIS ONE.
ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE THEAMERICAN CLASSIC, THE B.L.T.
IT'S AN HONEST SANDWICH THATTELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO
KNOW RIGHT UP FRONT.
IT'S GOT BACON, LETTUCE ANDTOMATO.
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'VE GOTTHE CLUB.
WHAT DOES THAT ACRONYM EVENSTAND FOR?
CHICKEN, LETTUCE, UNDERWEAR ANDBALLOONS?
THAT'S DISGUSTING!
SOUNDS LIKE THE DUMPSTER OUTSIDEPARTY CITY.
PLUS THE B.L.T. IS INSPIRED BYGOD.
THE BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATOREPRESENT THE HOLY TRINITY.
THE LETTUCE OF COURSE, THELETTUCE OF COURSE IS THE HOLY
GHOST BECAUSE NOBODY IS SURE WHYIT'S THERE.
(LAUGHTER)MEAN WHILE, THE CLUB ALSO HAS
BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO BUT ITRUINS THE PERFECT LINEUP BY
ADDING TURKEY.
THAT'S LIKE WHEN CROSBY, STILLSAND NASH RUINED THEIR LINEUP BY
ADDING A TURKEY!
(CHEERING)
HE, OF COURSE, IS LATER REPLACEDBY NEIL YOUNG WHO DID NOT HAVE
THE TURKEY'S VOCAL RANGE.
MEANWHILE THE B.L.T. IS A WARM,INVITING SANDWICH, WELCOMING TO
AL.
BUT THE CLUB SANDWICH IS SOEXCLUSIVE.
OH, WHAT'S THAT?
YOU WON'T LET ME INTO YOURSANDWICH CLUB BECAUSE I'M NOT
WEARING MY TENNIS WHITES AND MYLAST NAME DOESN'T END IN III?
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NERVESANDWICH --
WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO ONE OFYOUR INGREDIENTS.
NOT TO MENTION THE B.L.T. CANSTAND ON ITS OWN, WHEREAS THE
CLUB HAS NO STRUCTURE INTEGRITYAND MUST TO BE PROPPED UP BY A
DECORATIVE TOOTH PICK -- OR ASTHE CHILDREN CALL IT, MOMMY, THE
SANDWICH SHIVED ME IN THE MOUTH.
BUT HERE'S THE REAL CLINCHER,FOLKS, HERE'S THE REAL CLINCHER.
WHILE THE B.L.T. IS NESTLED BETWEEN TWO LIGHTLY TOASTED
BREAD SLICES, THE CLUB HAS THEAUDACITY TO ADD AN EXTRA LAYER
OF TOAST.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A FREAKYBREAD THREE-WAY, A MINAGE-A
TOAST. OH BECAUSE EVERYONEALWAYS SAYING WHAT?
OH THIS SANDWICH IS SO GOOD, IJUST WISH IT HAD MORE BREAD?
AND HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSEDTO TOAST THREE PIECES OF TOAST?
OH, I KNOW, I'LL USE MYTHREE-SLICE TOASTER!
(BLEEP) YOU!
I'M SORRY, FOLKS!
NO, NO, NO!
IT'S NOT EVEN A CONTEST, THECLUB SNADWICH  WILL DO IF YOU
HAVE FALLEN DOWN A CRAVASS ANDCAN'T EAT YOUR ARM.
THE CLEAR WINNER IS THE B.L.T.,IT'S AN AMERICAN HERO.
IT'S AN AMERICAN HERO THAT ISWAY BETTER THAN AN AMERICAN
HERO.
WELL I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOURQUESTION IL PAPA.
HOW ABOUT THOSE INDULGENCES IASKED FOR, NOW, OKAY?
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BUILT THERETIREMENT HOME SO CLOSE TO
WHERE MY CAR WAS DRIVING.
JIM, LET'S CLOSE THE INBOX.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
