MUCH.
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN
REPEATEDLY]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, THE 2012 ELECTION IS UPON
US, AND I LOVE A GOOD HORSE
RACE.
I LIKE TO GO WITH THE CANDIDATE
WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN GELDED.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHY I'M SADDLING UP
NEWT GINGRICH.
I REALLY THINK HE'S THE GUY.
AND THOUGH SOME OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE LAME-SCREAM-MEANIA --
[LAUGHTER]
-- HAVE COUNTED HIM OUT, NEWT
KNOWS HE'S GOT SOMETHING THE
OTHER CANDIDATES DON'T.
SAYING, QUOTE:
"I HAVE SIX TIMES AS MANY
TWITTER FOLLOWERS AS ALL THE
OTHER CANDIDATES COMBINED."
[LAUGHTER]
YES, NEWT HAS WON THE COVETED
VOTING BLOC OF BORED PEOPLE AT
WORK.
NEWT'S GOT 1.3 MILLION
FOLLOWERS, WHILE BACHMANN'S HAS
ONLY 66,000, MITT ROMNEY HAS÷FH;÷
63,000, AND RON PAUL HAS "WHAT'S
A TWITTER? IS THIS HOW I EBAY?"
[LAUGHTER]
FORGET POLLS, THIS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF AN
ELECTABLE PRESIDENT.
THAT'S WHY BEFORE NEWT GOT INTO
THE RACE, I WAS THROWING MY
WEIGHT BEHIND PRESIDENT KUTCHER.
[LAUGHTER]
HE ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO PLEASE
OUR NATION'S SENIORS.
MANY[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]
LOOKING GOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOLKS, SCANDAL IS ROCKING
NEWT'S TWEET-O-VERSE.
>> A FORMER STAFFER CLAIMS NEWT
GINGRICH PAID AN AGENCY TO
ARTIFICIALLY PUMP UP HIS TWITTER
FOLLOWERS TO SHOW MORE THAN A
MILLION FOLLOWERS.ñr
>> Stephen: WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
HIS TWITTER FOLLOWERS AREN'T
REAL?
ARE YOU TELLING ME TODAY'S YOUTH
DON'T FANCY A 68-YEAR-OLD,
SEMI-EMPLOYED, FORMER POLITICIAN
WHO TWEETS SUCH GEMS AS
"HAD GREAT LUNCH AT MABE'S
PIZZA."
[LAUGHTER]
AND "STOPPED IN FOR LUNCH AT THE
PIZZA SHACK."
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE,
MAN!
KIDS LOVE HEARIN' ABOUT THE
'GRICH EATIN' 'ZA.
[LAUGHTER]
THE FORMER STAFFER ALLEGES
THAT 80% OF NEWT'S FOLLOWERS ARE
INACTIVE OR DUMMY ACCOUNTS.
OH COME ON.
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME THAT
DEVOTED NEWT FOLLOWER
"AT 41113846806103" IS NOT A
LIVING, BREATHING PERSON WHO
JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE NO PHOTO,
NO PROFILE AND HAS NEVER
TWEETED?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, NEWT INSISTS HIS TWITTER
FOLLOWERS ARE LEGIT, AND I HAVE
NO REASON TO DOUBT THE WORD OF A
MAN WHO CHEATED ON TWO WIVES.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT LET'S SAY HE DID HIRE A FIRM
TO CREATE HIS TWITTER FOLLOWERS.
WELL, I SAY, MAKING UP FAKE
PEOPLE COULD BE THE KEY TO
KEEPING NEWT'S CAMPAIGN ALIVE.
HE SHOULD MAKE UP SOME FAKE
STAFFERS TO REPLACE THE REAL
ONES WHO QUIT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND HOW ABOUT SOME FAKE DONORS
TO REPLACE ALL THE ONES WHO'VE
ABANDONED HIM?
[LAUGHTER]
MAKE 'EM LOOK REAL RICH.
GIVE 'EM A MONOCLE AND A TOP
HAT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHILE HE'S AT IT, HE SHOULD
ALSO CREATE A FAKE NEWT GINGRICH
BECAUSE THE CURRENT ONE'S NOT
