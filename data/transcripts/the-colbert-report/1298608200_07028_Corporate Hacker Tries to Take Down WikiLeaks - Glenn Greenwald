CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.
WELL, JOINING ME NOW TO BE
INTIMIDATED BY PERSONAL
INFORMATION I MADE UP ABOUT
HIM IS SALON WRITER
WIKILEAKS SUPPORTER AND HB
GARY BLACKMAIL TARGET GLENN
GREENWALD.
GLENN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
DID YOU WANT SOME TOOTHPASTE.
>> NO, I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: OKAY, VERY
REFRESHING.
NOW GLENN, DID I GET THAT
RIGHT.
DID I EXPLAIN THE STORY
PROPERLY.
>> YOU DID, YOU EXPLAINED IT
WELL.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU ARE UP
SET ABOUT THIS, WHAT'S THE
BIG DEAL?
OKAY, IT IS A DANGEROUS
WORLD OUT THERE.Ã‘i
WE'RE AT CYBERWAR.
IF WE LOSE A COUPLE OF
JOURNALISTS WHOSE CAREERS
ARE CRUSHED BY LIES, ISN'T
THAT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO
KEEP BANK OF AMERICA ALIVE?
>> WELL, I THINK A LOT OF
THIS IS PRETTY
SELF-EVIDENTLY PERNICIOUS, I
MEAN THREATENING JOURNALIST-- .
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT PREANICIOUS MEANS.
>> IT IS PRETTY BAD IS WHAT
IT MEANS.
I MEAN THREATENING THE
CAREERS OF JOURNALISTS TO
DETER THEM FROM ADVOCATING
AND REPORTING.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU A
JOURNALIST IF YOU ARE
SUPPORTING WIKILEAKS BECAUSE
WIKILEAKS IS NOT JOURNALIST,
THEREFORE YOU MUST BE TAKING
YOURSELF OUT OF THE
JOURNALISM GAME BY EQUATING
YOURSELF WITH THEM,
CHECKMATE.
>> I THINK THEY'RE SHINING
LIGHT ON WHAT GOVERNMENT AND
CORPORATIONS DO IN SECRET
THAT ARE JUST DESTRUCTIVE
AND CORRUPT S ACTUALLY
PRETTY MUCH WHAT JOURNALISTS
IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUT.
>> Stephen: JOURNALISM IS
TAKING NOINGTS AT THE PRESS
CONFERENCE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
SO A LOT OF THIS IS NOT JUST
PERNICIOUS, THE WORD FOR THE
DAY BUT ALSO ILLEGAL.
A LOT OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED
IS-- .
>> Stephen: HOW IS IT
ILLEGAL.
NO ONE IS BEING PROSECUTED.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NO ONE IS BEING
PROSECUTED.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: SO IT IS NOT
REALLY ILLEGAL.
>> THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD.
>> Stephen: NO CHARGE NO
FOUL I BELIEVE IS THE
SAYING.
>> I THINK WHAT IS MOST
SIGNIFICANT HERE IS YOU HAVE
THESE PLANS THAT ARE CLEARLY
CROSSING ILLEGAL LINE, VERY
SERIOUS PLAYERS INVOLVED,
LAW FIRMS LIKE HUTTON AND
WILLIAMS MONK THE MOST
POWERFUL IN D.C. AND NO ONE
AT ANY POINT SAID YOU KNOW
WHAT, MAYBE THIS GOES A
LITTLE TOO FAR.
PAIN WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING
ANY OF THIS.
THEY WERE ALL ON BOARD WITH
IT.
AND EVEN WILLING SO CAVALIERLY
TO PUT A PLAN LIKE THIS THAT
CLEARLY POSES ILLEGAL STEPS
DOWN ON TO PAPER.
I THINK WHAT THAT CLEARLY
SHOWS IS THIS SORT OF STUFF
IN THIS WORLD OF CORPORATE
AND GOVERNMENT CON
SORECIOUS-- CONSORTIUM OF
POWER IS PRETTY NORMAL.
PAR FOR THE COURSE.
>> Stephen: BUT DOESN'T THE
GOVERNMENT HAVE TO WALK ON
THE DARK SIDE AS DICK CHENEY
SAID F OUR CYBERENEMIES ARE
WALKING ON THE DARK SIDE?
I MEAN YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T
YOU BREAK THE LAW FIRST BY
CONSPIRING WITH WIKILEAKS TO
MAKE A BANK UNCOMFORTABLE?
>> I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
MAKING BANKS UNCOMFORTABLE,
AT LEAST YET S NOT ILLEGAL.
AND SUPPORTING WIKILEAKS IS
NOT ILLEGAL AS WELL.
WHAT IS ILLEGAL ARE THE
KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE
INVOLVED IN THIS PROPOSAL.
IRONICALLY THIS ILLUSTRATES
WHY WIKILEAKS IS SO NEEDED.
THIS IS A WORLD, THIS
GOVERNMENT CORPORATE WORLD
THAT OPERATES COMPLETELY
OPAQUELY WITHOUT ANY
RESTRAINTS OR
ACCOUNTABILITY.
WIKILEAKS SOMEONE OF THE
VERY FEW ENTITIES THAT IS
SHINING A LIGHT ON WHAT'S
ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE AND
WHAT "THE WASHINGTON POST"
CALLS TOP SECRET AMERICA.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE IN BED
WITH PEOPLE LIKE ANONYMOUS,
OKAY.
BY THE WAY, ARE YOU
ANONYMOUS?
>> WE'RE ALL ANONYMOUS IS
THEIR SAYING.
BUT AARON-- .
>> Stephen: HOW AFRAID
SHOULD WE BE OF THESE
ANONYMOUS PEOPLE, HOW
POWERFUL ARE THEY?
>> I THINK THEY ARE A LOT
LESS POWERFUL THAN THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HUTTON
AND WILLIAMS AND THE
INTERNET SECURITY FIRMS THAT
ARE PLOTTING TO DESTROY THE
CAREERS OF PEOPLE WHO
ADVOCATE THINGS THAT THEY
DISLIKE AND THE WORLD WHICH
THEY ARE APART IS LESS
POWERFUL THAN ANONYMOUS.
WHAT ANONYMOUS DID IS WHAT
JOURNALISTS SHOULD BE DO IS
WHICH IS EXPOSING SERIOUS
CORRUPTION AND ILLEGALITY
AMONG THE NATION'S MOST
POWERFUL FACTIONS.
>> Stephen: DO YOU BANK WITH
BANK OF AMERICA.
>> I DO NOT.
>> Stephen: WHO DOW BANK
WITH.
>> I BANK WITH SEVERAL
INSTITUTIONS, I WOULD NEVER
BE INVOLVED IN SCHEMES LIKE
THIS.
>> Stephen: DOW WANT TO
REVEAL WHO THEY ARE AND
MAYBE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: LET ME GIVE
THOSE NUMBERSES TO HB GARY?
>> I THINK THEY PROBABLY
ALREADY HAVE THEM.
>> Stephen: GLENN GREENWALD,
THANK YOU FOR
