THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WHEN YOU CHANT MY NAME LIKE THAT, YOU MAKE ME FEEL ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE.

THE TOP STORY TONIGHT HAS TO BE THE DRAMATIC NEWS COMING FROM THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL
RELIGIOUS LEADER PAT ROBERTSON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW, IN A WORLD FULL OF WAR AND POVERTY AND MORAL DECAY, PAT IS WILLING TO CONFIRM THE
ETERNAL QUESTIONS.
ON MONDAY HE DID IT AGAIN.
>> THIS IS KERRY WHO SAYS I BUY A LOT OF CLOTHES AND OTHER ITEMS AT GOODWILL AND OTHER SECONDHAND SHOPS.
MY MOM TOLD ME I NEEDED TO PRAY OVER THE ITEMS, BIND FAMILIAR�i SPIRITS ANPi�i�� BLESS THE ITEMS
BEFORE I COME INTO THE HOUSE.
CAN DEMONS ATTACH THEMSELVES TO MATERIAL ITEMS.
>> CAN DEMONIC EXPERIENCE ATTACH THEMSELVES TO INANIMATE OBJECTS THE ANSWER IS YES BUT I DON'T
THINK EVERY SWEATER YOU GET FROM GOODWILL HAS DEMONS IN IT.
>> Stephen: NOT EVERY SWEATER, JUST THE V-NECKS, ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M ISSUING A STEPHEN COLBERT CONSUMER ALERT.
FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO HEED PAT ROBERTSON'S WARNING BECAUSE THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE ITEMS
YOU BUY AT GOODWILL ARE POSSESSED BY DEMONS.
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVIL SPIRITS ARE SUCKERS FOR RAYON SLACKS, BROKEN BLENDERS AND CLASSIC
ALBUMS LIKE KEN BY REQUEST.
YOU NEED TOLL PURIFY YOUR SECONDHAND�� CLOTHING.�i THANKFULLY MANY SECONDHAND CLOTHING MANUFACTURERS PRINT
DETAILED DEMON BANISHING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TAG ALONG WITH A SERIES OF SYMBOLS NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.
SEE IF WE HAVE ONE ON IN A SHIRT RIGHT HERE.
OKAY, TO CAST OUT LUCIFER AND ALL OF HIS�i MINIONS, ALWAYS WASH IN COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW.
VERY IMPORTANT.
HEAT JUST SETS THE DEALON -- DEMON.
AVOID RINSING OUT YOUR WIFE'S DEMONS.
MOST CAN'T GO IN THE DRYER AND HANGING OVER THE CHAIRBACK IS HELL.
YOU WANT TO PRETREAT YOUR DOMON GO.
FORTH AND PURGE YOUR GARMENTS AMERICA, IN
