IT'S LIKE A STEAMY EPISODE OF "GENERAL'S HOSPITAL."  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
AND THESE DAYS-- THESE DAYS, INFORMATION, I SPEND MY AFTERNOONS YOU KNOW PLOPPED ON
THE COUCH IN THE HOUSECOAT, WATCHING CNN WITH A VIRGINIA SLIM IN BON HAND AND A BOX OF
AFTER 8s IN THE OTHER.
I DON'T CARE IF THE NEWS GOES STRAIGHT TO MY HIMSELF.
IT IS ME TIME.
THIS STORY HAS GOT EVERYTHING-- A DECORATED WAR HERO HAS AN AFFAIR WITH HIS OWN SEXY
BIOGRAPHER, WHO SENSES THE SPY MASTER IS STEPPING OUT ON HER WITH A SECOND GIRLFRIEND, SO SHE
SENDS AN E-MAIL FROM A SECRET ACCOUNT SAYING STEP OFF OR I WILL CUT, BIATCH.
AND THE SECOND HOTTIE FREAKS OUT AND CONTACTS HER FRIENDS, F.B.I.
AGENT, WHO LAUNCHES AN INVESTIGATION, BUT GETS PULLED OFF THE CASE BECAUSE HE SEXED
HER A SHIRTLESS PHOTO.
THE SPY MASTERY PROTEGE, ALSO A GENERAL, HAS SENT THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS TO THE SECOND WOMAN.
THIS ISN'T JUST A LOVE TRIANGLE, INFORMATION.
IT'S A LOVE PENTAGON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I GOTTA SAY-- I GOTTA SAY, AFTER THAT, IT GETS A LITTLE FARFETCHED.
I MEAN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE SECOND WOMAN HANS EMOTIONALLY TROUBLED IDENTICAL TWIN.
AND BOTH THE SPY MAST EXPERT GENERAL WRITE LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR THE TWIN SISTER'S CUSTODY
BATTLE WITH HER ECONCLUSION?
OH, AND LISTEN TO THE NAME THEY CAME UP WITH FOR HIM?

AND THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE PARTS, THEY SAY THAT-- THAT-- THAT THE GENERAL DOWN THERE,
THAT GENERAL OVER THERE, HE IS THE TOP COMMANDER OF OUR WAR IN AFGHANISTAN.
AFGHANISTAN?

THAT ON THE NEWS INSTEAD OF ALL THIS BULL ( BLEEP )?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT BELIEVABLE.

ANYWAY, BOTTOM LINE, IT'S A SOAP OPERA AND IT IS DONE.
WE SHOULD ALL MOVE ON.
