NATION, THEY SAY THOSE WHO LIVE
IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULDN'T THROW
STONES.
ALSO WALK AROUND NAKED, NOT THE
BEST IDEA EITHER.
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FIRST UP, LADIES AND FOLKS, IT'S
NO SECRET THAT OUR PUBLIC
SCHOOLS ARE CASH STRAPPED.
HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSES ARE
SO HARD UP FOR FUNDING THEY HAVE
TO DISSECT THE SCHOOL MASCOT.
BUT RATHER THAN RAISE MY TAXES
TO PAY FOR VANITY ITEMS LIKE
DESKS AND KNOWLEDGE, ONE SCHOOL
DISTRICT IS USING THE FREE
MARKET.
JIM?
>> HOMEWORK TIME IS GETTING A
LITTLE MORE LUCRATIVE IN PEABODY
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
THE DISTRICT, HOPING TO RAISE
CASH BY SELLING AD SPACE ON THE
BACKS OF NOTICES AND PERMISSION
SLIPS THAT WIND UP IN THE HANDS
OF PARENTS CONSTANTLY.
THAT'S POTENTIALLY AN EXTRA
$15,000 TO $24,000 A YEAR FOR
THE DISTRICT.
>> Stephen: WITH ALL THE MONEY
THEY'LL BE MAKING ON THE FIELD
TRIP PERMISSION SLIP, MAYBE THEY
CAN AFFORD TO GO ON FIELD TRIPS.
SO I'M GIVING A BIG TIP OF MY
HAT TO THE PEABODY PUBLIC
SCHOOLS FOR TURNING OUR CHILDREN
INTO WALKING POP-UP ADS.
FIRST OF ALL... YEAH, GIVE IT
UP.
( APPLAUSE )
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS GREAT NEWS
FOR KIDS.
NOW WHEN THEY TAKE HOME A
DISCIPLINARY NOTE FROM THEIR
TEACHER, THEIR PARENTS WILL SAY,
"BRIAN, I'M SO DISAPPOINTED.
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
GROUND YOU FOR -- HEY, MATTRESS
BARN IS HAVING A HALF-OFF SALE.
" I SAY, WHY STOP AT SCHOOL
NOTES WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY
MORE EDU-ADVER-TUNITIES OUT
THERE.
WHY NOT LET ADVERTISERS BUY
PRIME SPACE ON OUR TESTS.
INSTEAD OF WHAT IS THE
PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM, HOW ABOUT
WHICH TACO BELL GORDITA IS THE
BEST?
( APPLAUSE )
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A TRICK
QUESTION.
THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY DELICIOUS.
NEXT, A WAG OF MY FINGER AT ANDY
ROONEY.
NOW, THIS ONE HURTS A LITTLE
BECAUSE ANDY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY
ROLE MODEL WHEN IT COMES TO
PASSING JUDGMENT ON THE BIGGEST
ISSUES AFFECTING AMERICANS'
LIVES.
>> THEY CALL THEM COMIC STRIPS
NOW.
"COMIC" IS A PRETENTIOUS NAME
FOR FUNNY.
IT IS MY OBSERVATION THAT PEOPLE
ARE CARRYING MORE STUFF THAN
THEY USED TO.
I DON'T KNOW WHO LADY GAGA.
IS I HATE TO HAVE A STICKER ON A
PIECE OF FRUIT.
I THINK OVER THE YEARS I'VE
WASTED MORE MONEY ON MELONS THAN
ANYTHING ELSE I'VE EVER BOUGHT.
I DON'T LIKE GREEN FRUIT.
GREEN IS FOR VEGETABLES.
>> Stephen: I WOULD GIVE
ANYTHING TO SIT NEXT TO HIM ON A
LISTENING FLIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT LAST SUNDAY, FOLKS, ANDY
ROONEY WENT AFTER A NEW
TARGET -- ANDY ROONEY.
>> I PLAN TO LOSE 20 POUNDS BY
HALLOWEEN.
>> Stephen: 20 POUNDS BY
HALLOWEEN?
IS THAT EVEN COUNTING WHAT HE'LL
LOSE IN BONE DENSITY?
ANDY, ANDY, BUDDY, EVERYBODY
WANTS TO LOOK HOT, BUT I HATE TO
SEE YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN
SOCIETY'S UNREALIST ICHABODDY
IMAGE FOR 91-YEAR-OLDS.
YOU CAN'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO
THE IMPOSSIBLE STANDARDS SET BY
THE COVER OF "SENIOR LIVING"
MAGAZINE.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S NOT REAL.
THEY AIRBRUSH OUT THE WATTLE.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL THE WAY YOU
ARE, ANDY.
NOT EVERYONE IS BLESSED WITH THE
WRINKLE STRUCTURE OF A MORLEY
SAFER.
( LAUGHTER )
JUST BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE, A
PLUS-SIZE CURMUDGEON WITH SOME
JUNK IN THE TRUNK, AND DON'T BE
AFRAID TO LET YOUR HAIR DOWN,
BUT NOT YOUR EYEBROWS.
THEY GET ANY LOWER AND YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE.
( LAUGHTER )
FINALLY, A WAG OF MY FINGER AT
"WASHINGTON POST" ARCHITECTURE
CRITIC PHILIP KENNICOTT FOR HIS
REVIEW FOR THE DESIGN OF THE
GROUND ZERO MOSQUE.
IN THE ARTICLE HE SAYS THAT THE
OPEN AND BRIGHT RENDERINGS
INVITE A CHANCE TO REDRAW
CONCLUSIONS.
NOT MY CONCLUSION, KENNY.
I SAY IT WILL BE A BLIGHT ON THE
DOWNTOWN AREA, OBLITERATING THE
ARCHITECTURAL TREASURE CURRENTLY
AT THAT SPOT, AN ABANDONED
BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY.
LOOK AT THE STUNNING USE OF
CONCRETE AND RUSTED IRON WINDOW
BARS, USUALLY SEEN ONLY IN NORTH
KOREAN STRIP MALLS.
I MEAN, COMPARE THAT TO THIS
HIDEOUS ISLAMIC CENTER DESIGN.
I MEAN, YES, THE LATTICE WORK
AND CLEAN LINES LEND AN AIR OF
OPENNESS AND ALMOST ECUMENICAL
OFFERING TO THE CITY, BOTH TIED
TO TRADITION AND FORWARD LOOKING
AND ORGANIC WITHOUT SEEMING
CHAOTIC.
IT SETTLES INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD
NOT THROUGH MIMICRY BUT THROUGH
ITS URBANE DISPOSITION.
GODDAMN IT, KENNICOTT IS RIGHT.
I MEAN, THIS DESIGN HAS FORCED
AN AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL OF MY
WESTERN SOCIOPOLITICAL AESTHETIC
CONCEIT.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY,
THIS BUT AFTER SEEING IT, I AM
NOW FULLY IN FAVOR OF BUILDING
THE ISLAM -- WAIT A SECOND.
I JUST NOTICED SOMETHING.
JIMMY, PULL THIS UP FULL AGAIN.
CAN I SEE THIS WITH A CHROMATIC
INVERSION.
OKAY.
NOW HIGHLIGHT ALL THE
TESSELATIONS MORE THAN 100
DEGREES.
NOW ENHANCE.
IT'S BIN LADEN!
I KNEW IT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES.
NICE TRY, ISLAMIC CULTURAL
CENTER, BUT
