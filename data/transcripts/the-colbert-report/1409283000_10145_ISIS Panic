REPORT," EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGUS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS!
IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT THECOLBERT NATION IS STANDING
STRONG NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENSALL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE,
FOLKS, FOR MONTHS, THE WORLD HASBEEN SHOCKED BY THE BRUTAL
TERRORIST GROUP I.S.I.S.
DON'T BE FOOLED JUST BECAUSETHEY HAVE THE SAME NAME YOUR
LONELY AUNT GAVE HER CAT.
(LAUGHTER)THESE GUYS ARE PURE EVIL.
TV, SCARE ME TILL IT'S BROWNDOWNTOWN!
>> I.S.I.S. IS BRUTAL?
THEY ARE ANIMALS --BEHEADINGS, CRUCIFIXIONS, MASS
EXECUTIONS OR LIVE BURIALS,ENSLAVEMENT OF WOMEN.
THEY CERTAINLY AREN'T THE J.V.
TEAM OF AL QUAIDA.
THEY'RE THE GREEN BAY PACKERS.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY'RE THEGREEN BAY PACKERS, BUT WITH
BEHEADINGS.
SO SLIGHTLY LESS HEAD TRAUMATHAN the N.F.L.
AND YES --(APPLAUSE)
-- YES, THE U.S. DID HITI.S.I.S. WITH AIRSTRIKES IN
IRAQ.
BUT THAT JUST DROVE THEM BACKINTO SYRIA, WHERE, LAST WEEK
THEY CAPTURED A MAJOR AIR BASE.
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOODTHAT WILL DO, SINCE I'M GUESSING
THEY'RE ALL ON THE "NO FLY"LIST.
(LAUGHTER)THINK, GUYS!
SO WHO EXACTLY IS "IS-IS?
(LAUGHTER)ACCORDING TO THE "THE NEW YORK
TIMES," THE GROUP HAS "THE GROUPHAS QUIETLY BUILT AN EFFECTIVE
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF MOSTLYMIDDLE MIDDLE-AGED IRAQIS.
AND THEIR LEADER, ABU BAKRAL-BAGHDADI, HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
AS "A BALDING, MIDDLE AGED MAN."
(LAUGHTER)IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE
40-SOMETHINGS HAVING A MID-LIFEISIS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW IT
IS! WE'VE ALL SEEN IT.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, YOU SEE YOURYOUTH SLIPPING AWAY, SO YOU GO
OUT AND GET AN EXOTIC NEW SPORTSTANK, AND CHEAT ON YOUR WIFE
WITH ONE OF YOUR OTHER WIVES.
AND YOU TRY TO DIET, BUT YOUSTILL CAN'T FIT INTO YOUR HIGH
SCHOOL SUICIDE VEST.
WORST OF ALL, ISIS HAS NOWATTRACTED THE MOST VIOLENT,
HEAVILY-ARMED PEOPLE ON EARTH --AMERICANS.
>> NEW DETAILS EMERGING ABOUTAMERICAN JIHADIST DOUGLAS
McCAIN.
HE WASN'T THE ONLY TERRORIST TOCOME FROM ROBBINSDALE COOPERS
HIGH SCHOOL IN MINNESOTA.
WE NOW KNOW TROY CASTAGAR WHOWENT OVERSEAS TO FIGHT IN AN
AL QUAIDA GROUP WITH McCAIN'SCLASSMATE.
THERE COULD BE A THIRD TERRORISTFROM ROBBINSDALE COOPERS HIGH
SCHOOL THIS GUNMEN IS WEARING ASHIRT SAYING COOPER HAWKS,
THE SAME AS THE HIGH SCHOOLMASCOT.
>> Stephen: THE COOPER HAWKS!
THAT TEAM LEAVES IT "ALL" OUT ONTHE FIELD.
ESPECIALLY AFTER A DRONE STRIKE.
THEIR PROM THEME THIS YEAR WASISRAEL UNDER THE SEA.
(LAUGHTER)AND WHILE ISIS IS A RELATIVELY
NEW TERROR GROUP, THIS CONFLICTHAS ITS ROOTS IN THE
SEVENTH-CENTURY SUNNI-SHIITESPLIT, WITH SUNNI'S FOLLOWING
MUHAMMED'S FATHER-IN-LAW ABUBAKR, WHILE SHIITES FOLLOW
MUHAMMED'S SON-IN-LAW ALI.
SO, IN OTHER WORDS, THIS ISOBAMA'S FAULT.
>> THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ISDERELICT IN HIS DUTIES TO GET
AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM ANDPROTECT THE HOMELAND.
>> WE HAVE A RUDDERLESSSITUATION IN A DANGEROUS WORLD.
EVERYONE IS HOLDING THEIRBREATH.
FOR THE PRESIDENT NOT TO ACTPOLITICALLY, ACT LIKE THE MAN OF
THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOURFAMILY THE UNITED STATES HERE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
>> Stephen: YEAH, ACT LIKE AMAN!
STEP UP.
TAKE WHAT YOU WANT.
YES, YOU WANTED TO BOMB SYRIALAST YEAR AND WE SAID NO, BUT
SOMETIMES NO MEANS YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THIS GUY NEEDS A HARD DOSE OF
REALITY.
RIGHT, WOMAN WHO LIVES IN AWORLD OF IMAGINATION?
>> CAN I MAKE A SPECIAL REQUESTIN THE MAGIC LAND?
WE GET NETANYAHU, PUTIN IN FOR48 HOURS, HEAD OF THE UNITED
STATES, I DON'T KNOW, JUST WANTSOMEBODY TO GET IN HERE AND GET
IT DONE RIGHT:>> Stephen: YES!
PUTIN OR NETANYAHU, OR BETTERYET, COMBINE THEM INTO PRESIDENT
NETAN-PUT-HU!
SHIRTLESS, BUT WITH NIPPLEYARMULKES.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
COME IN HANDY IF YOU'RE RUNNINGA MARATHON OR SOMETHING.
BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE MAKING(BLEEP) UP, AS A CONSERVATIVE,
MY ALLEGIANCE IS WITH AN EVENGREATER IMAGINARY LEADER:
RONALD REAGAN.
'HE'S' THE ONE WE SHOULD BEPRETENDING IS STOPPING THIS
CRISIS.
AND NEWT GINGRICH AGREESYESTERDAY, NEWT POSTED A LENGTHY
FAKE SPEECH HE IMAGINES REAGANWOULD GIVE IF HE WERE STILL
AROUND.
AND IT IS EXACTLY WHAT REAGANWOULD SAY IF HE WERE STILL
ALIVE, AND SOMEHOW STILLPRESIDENT SERVING A NINTH TERM
AT THE AGE OF 103.
QUOTH REAGAN, QUOTH NEWT:"DEFEATING TERRORISTS AND
BLACKMAILERS IS NOTHING NEW INAMERICAN HISTORY.
JEFFERSON HATED WAR AND LOVEDPEACE.
HE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THEREWERE TIMES WHEN VICIOUS
OPPONENTS GIVE PEACE-LOVINGPEOPLE NO CHOICE BUT TO ENGAGE
IN JUST WAR."
AND IF NEWT KNOWS EXACTLY HOWJEFFERSON FELT, I'M SURE HE WILL
ALSO WRITE A FICTIONAL SPEECHTHAT JEFFERSON WOULD HAVE GIVEN
IN 1984, WHEN REAGAN DECIDED TOGET OUR MARINES THE HELL OUT OF
LEBANON.
FAKE JEFFERSON WOULD BE JUST ASDISAPPOINTED IN REAL REAGAN AS
FAKE REAGAN IS IN REAL OBAMA.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT NEWTWILL IMAGINE FAKE OBAMA WILL ONE
DAY SAY ABOUT THE MIDEAST POLICYOF  PRESIDENT BLUE IVY.
(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
