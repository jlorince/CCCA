>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THEREPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGUS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
(AUDIENCE CHANTS "STEPHEN!")
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
I'M NOT SURPRISED-- FOLKS.
I JOIN YOU IN YOUR CELEBRATION.I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS
COMING FROM. I KNOW WHERE THATGOOD FEELING IS ROOTED.
BECAUSE, NATION, ONCE AGAIN, IFYOU READ THE PAPERS,YOU KNOW
THAT ONCE AGAIN, IT IS A GREATDAY FOR OUR COUNTRY IN THAT
IT IS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR BARACKOBAMA.
HE IS FACING A FIRESTORM OFCRITICISM AFTER TRADING FIVE
HIGH-LEVEL TALIBAN FIGHTERS FORCAPTURED ARMY SGT BOWE BERGDAHL.
IT'S A SCANDAL SOME ARE CALLINGBERGDGHAZI.
SO FAR, IT'S JUST ME, BUT IT'SGOING TO CATCH ON.
ON TUESDAY, AT THE G7 SUMMIT INPOLAND, THE PRESIDENT DEFENDED
HIS ACTIONS.
>> LET ME JUST MAKE A VERYSIMPLE POINT HERE, AND THAT IS
REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES,WHATEVER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY
TURN OUT TO BE, WE STILL GET ANAMERICAN SOLDIER BACK IF HE'S
HELD IN CAPTIVITY. PERIOD. FULLSTOP.
>> Stephen:  YOU CAN'T ARGUEWITH THAT.
COMMA. OR CAN YOU. QUESTIONMARK.
BECAUSE OF COURSE, WE WANT TOGET EVERY AMERICAN SOLDIER BACK.
BUT DO WE WANT TO GET EVERYAMERICAN SOLDIER BACK?
BECAUSE THE TV HAS SOMEQUESTIONS.
>> IS HE AN AMERICAN HERO OR ADESERTER?
>> A MEMBER OF HIS PLATOON SAYSBERGDAHL LEFT HIS OWN POST ON
HIS OWN VOLITION, BACK IN 2009.
>> SHORTLY BEFORE HE WALKED OFFTHE BASE HE WROTE TO HIS PARENTS
ABOUT HIS DISILLUSIONMENT WITHTHE MILITARY AND HIS MISSION IN
AFGHANISTAN.
>> HEAR THAT?
THIS GUY HAD GROWN DISILLUSIONEDWITH THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN.
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WORD FORTHAT: 82% OF AMERICANS.
PLUS, SHOULD WE BE BRINGING THISGUY BACK WHEN SEVERAL OF THOSE
WHO SERVED WITH BERGDAHL CHARGEDTHAT SOLDIERS DIED SEARCHING FOR
HIM?
AND I AGREE WITH ANYONE WHO SAYSTHE BEST WAY TO HONOR THEIR
SACRIFICE IS TO NEVER COMPLETETHEIR MISSION.
AND NOW, WE'RE ALSO LEARNINGTHAT BERGDAHL HAS A HISTORY OF
UN-AMERICAN BEHAVIOR DATING BACKTO HIS CHILDHOOD IN SUN VALLEY,
IDAHO.
>> WELL, HE APPARENTLY WAS INTOBALLET.
>> AT THE AGE OF 16, HE STARTEDTAKING BALLET LESSONS AT A LOCAL
STUDIO.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL TODAYTHAT HE TOOK BALLET.
HOW LONG DID HE DO THAT?
>> HE STARTED TAKING BALLET WHENHE WAS ABOUT 17 AND CONTINUED
TAKING IT UNTIL HE WAS 22, 23.
>> Stephen:  YES, LONG BEFOREBERGDAHL'S TIME WITH THE TALIBAN
MILITIA, HE SPENT YEARS IN THEHANDS OF ANOTHER RADICAL GROUP,
THE SUGARPLUM FAIRIES.
AND FOX NEWS' DR. KEITH ABLOWKNOWS WHAT IT MEANS WHEN A MAN
DOES BALLET.
>> THE FACT THAT HE WAS A DANCERAND A LIFTER-- NOT A
WEIGHTLIFTER, BUT HE WOULD IGUESS LIFT UP--
>> THE BALLERINA.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> I THINK FRONT AND CENTER ONANY STAGE IS THIS GUY'S M.O.,
UNLESS IT DOESN'T FEED HIMNARCISSISTICALLY.
YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM A JOB UNLESSYOU'RE GOING TO TELL HIM YOU'RE
THE STAR AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEPYOU AT A THROTTLE OF 12 OUT OF
10.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S WHY HE WASDISILLUSIONED WITH THE MISSION
IN AFGHANISTAN-- IT LACKED THEFULL-THROTTLE INTENSITY OF THE
SUN VALLEY, IDAHO BALLET SCHOOL.
JUST TO RECAP-- DESERTER.
ENDANGERED SOLDIERS' LIVES.
SKIPPED AROUND IN TIGHTS.
AAAAAND... I'M FORGETTINGSOMETHING.
>> THE FATHER WITH THE BEARD.
>> Stephen:  DAD, BEARD.
DAD BEARD.
BAD DAD.
BAGHDAD.
COINCIDENCE THAT IT'S ADIFFERENT COUNTRY? METHINKS
HE DOTH BEARD TOO MUCH.
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY ASINFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE
WHICH IS HOPEFULLY NEVER BECAUSERIGHT NOW I'M IN THE SWEET SPOT
BETWEEN COMPLETE IGNORANCE ANDRIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.
IT'S PRETTY GREAT.
