>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.
IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO.

GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, IT HAS WITHIN FOUR YEARS
SINCE NANCY PELOSI PROMISED TO
DRAIN THE SWAMP OF POLITICAL
CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON.
FOR MOST OF THOSE YEARS, IT
SEEMS LIKE THE DRAIN'S BEEN
CLOGGED BY A PARTICULARLY LARGE
HAIRBALL.
CHARLIE RANGEL.
BUT YESTERDAY THE HOUSE ETHICS
COMMITTEE FINALLY SNAKED THE
PIPE.
>> THE NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN CHARLES RANGEL WAS
CONVICTED BY HIS PEERS IN THE
HOUSE ON 11 OUT OF 13 COUNTS OF
ETHICS VIOLATIONS.
>> Stephen: 11 FLY GRANT
ETHICS VIOLATIONS.
MAN, THEY ARE GOING TO THROW THE
BOOK AT HIM.
>> RANGEL IS LIKELY TO FACE A
FORMAL LETTER OF REPRIMAND.
>> Stephen: A FORMER LETTER OF
REPRIMAND.
CHARLIE RANGEL, YOU GOT MAIL.
YOU HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO READ
SOME SENTENCES.
NOW, FOLKS, IT MAY NOT SOUND
LIKE MUCH TO YOU AND ME, BUT
THESE CONGRESSIONAL LETTERS OF
REPRIMAND PULL NO PUNCHES.
THEY'RE NOT TYPED UP IN SOME
FRIENDLY FONT LIKE GERIMAND.
NO, THEY USE THE MOST JUDGMENTAL
FONT, LIKE TIMES ROMAN OR
AERIAL, ATAL SIZED, POLLED.
-- BOLD.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, CONSIDERING
HOW SERIOUS THESE CHARGES ARE,
HE MIGHT RECEIVE CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT.
( LAUGHTER )
CHARLIE RANGEL, I HOPE YOU
LEARNED YOUR LESSON, SIR,
BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME YOU COMMIT
11 ETHICS VIOLATIONS TO THE TUNE
OF $9 MILLION, THAT LETTER WILL
BE SENT HOME TO YOUR PARENTS.
