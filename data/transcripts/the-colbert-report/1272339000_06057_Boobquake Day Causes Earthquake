[LAUGHTER]
AND I TELL YOU, I LOVE OUR COUNTRY, BUT NATION, I AM SO SICK OF IRAN.
THEY HAVE BEEN A BEE IN OUR BURQA FOR TOO LONG.
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY, THE PUNISHMENT FOR FINDING A BEE IN YOUR BURKA IS BEING STONED TO DEATH.
WELL, THE IRANIANS ARE AT IT AGAIN.
LAST WEEK IRANIAN CLERIC HOJATOLESLAM KAZEM SEDIGHI SAID,
"MANY WOMEN WHO DO NOT DRESS MODESTLY LEAD YOUNG MEN ASTRAY,
CORRUPT THEIR CHASTITY AND SPREAD ADULTERY IN SOCIETY,
WHICH INCREASES EARTHQUAKES."
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT?
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
SKIMPY CLOTHES DON'T CAUSE EARTHQUAKES.
IT'S FEMINISTS CAUSE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND GAYS CAUSE HURRICANES.
THE ONLY SEISMIC ACTIVITY SCANTILY CLAD WOMEN CAUSE ARE TROUSER TREMORS, AND LUCKILY,
FOLKS, SOMEBODY OUT THERE IS STANDING UP TO THIS CLERIC.
I READ IN THE "NEW YORK POST" TODAY THAT PURDUE UNIVERSITY SENIOR JENNIFER McCREIGHT HAS
BRAVELY DECLARED TODAY BOOBQUAKE DAY, CALLING FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO WEAR SKIMPY
CLOTHING TO MOVE THIS IRANIAN MADMAN WRONG.
I SAY, YOU GO, GIRL!
THIS IS AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
RIGHT THERE, THIS IS AMERICA,
WHERE EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND LETTING THEIR MILK SHAKE BRING ALL THE BOYS TO
THE YARD.
[APPLAUSE]
BEST OF ALL, THESE WOMEN ARE MOVING THAT THIS CLERIC IS JUST STUPID FOR SAYING THAT DRESSING
SEXY AND EARTHQUAKES HAVE ANYTHING TO... WHAT'S THAT?
THERE'S SOME FOOTAGE FROM THIS MORNING I NEED TO SEE?
OKAY, JIMMY, ROLL IT.
>> 56.9 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK OFF THE COAST OF TAIWAN.
NO TSUNAMI WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED.
THE QUAKE SHOOK BUILDINGS BUT NO REPORT OF ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY.
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD!
[LAUGHTER]
HODA KOTB SALEMI CASEY KASEM SUZUKI WAS RIGHT.
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE HAVE RADICAL CLERICS BEEN RIGHT ABOUT ALL THIS TIME?
I MEAN, MAYBE AMERICA REALLY IS THE GREAT SATAN.
I MEAN, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T EDUCATE WOMEN.
IT'S WORKED GREAT||
