>> Stephen: WELCOME-- WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH, NATION, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU BUT IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS A MODEL STUDENT.
IN THAT I SPENT MOST OF IT SNIFFING AIRPLANE GLUE.
THIS IS EYES ON EDUKASHON.
TONIGHT CHEMISTRY.
ANYONE WITH A TEENAGER KNOWS THAT THE TIGHTEST END OF THE EDUCATIONAL THINKER IS
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS.
EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR THAT EDGE, TO HELP THEM SPEND A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS
ON A WORTHLESS PHILOSOPHY DEGREE.
AND FOLKS, IT KEEPS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER.
YOU'RE UP AGAINST AN ARMY OF OVERACHIEVING GENIUSES WITH AN 8.0 GPA WHO PLAYED THE
VIOLIN SINCE THE SECOND TRIMESTER AND WHOSE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES INCLUDE FLYING THE CHOP
THEIR GOT BIN LADEN.
SO I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS.
>> HIGH SCHOOL KIDS FACE A LOT OF PRESSURE INTO GETTING INTO COLLEGE.
BUT IT TURNS OUT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE ABUSING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ADEROL
AND RITALIN TO HELP THEM PASS THEIR TEST.
CALL THEM STUDY DRUGS.
THEY SAY THE DRUGS GIVE STUDENTS A BOOST OF ENERGY,
AND INCREASE THEIR ATTENTION SPAN.
>> Stephen: YES, STUDY DRUGS.
A SUREFIRE WAY TOP IMPROVE YOUR GRADES IF ARE YOU TOO LAZY TO SLEEP WITH YOUR TEACHER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW IN A RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" DOCTORS AND
STUDENTS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 40% OF CHILDREN AT TOP SCHOOLS ARE RIDING THE
CONCENTRATION PONE HOPING TO GAIN WHAT ONE TEEN USER DESCRIBED AS LASER FOCUS,
INSTANT RECALL AND THE FORTITUDE TO CRUSH ANY TEST IN HER PATH.
(LAUGHTER) NOW IF SHE COULD JUST GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR GAMMA RADIATION SHE COULD BECOME QUIZ HULK.
HULK GETS 2400 ON SATs.
I WANT TO TALK TO THE KIDS FOR A SECOND.
KIDS, DON'T BE SO-- YOU SEE,
I KNOW YOU KUZ THE YOUTH DIG ME.
I'M ONE OF THEM.
I'M JUST KICK IT, BLASTING THE DAVE MATHEWS, WEARING KHAKIES, USING A LAND LINE.
LOOK, KIDS, I GET IT.
WITH ALL THAT PRESSURE TO SUCCEED, A SHORTCUT LIKE SNORTING ADEROL SEEMS LIKE A
NO-BRAINER, BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT SUCCEEDING OR NOT?
EVERY ONE APPLYING TO ELITE SCHOOLS IS SNORTING ADEROL.
IF YOU WANT TO BE SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO STEP IT UP.
I SUGGEST A COCKTAIL OF-- ECSTASY AND 50 CCs OF ADRENALINE AND A CARDIAC
KANSAS CITY NEEDLE LIKE UMA THURMAN IN "PULP FICTION".
THAT IS WHAT GETTING INTO STANDFORD FEELS LIKE.
NOW FOLKS, LET ME PUT THIS IN ANOTHER WAY.
THIS IS YOUR BRAIN.
THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON DRUGS.
(LAUGHTER) ANY QUESTIONS?
OKAY, QUIZ TIME.
A TRAIN LEAVES CHICAGO GOING 120 MILES PER HOUR.
YOU'RE RUNNING NEXT TO IT WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT.
WHAT ARE YOU ON AND WHY AREN'T YOU SHARING IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR EYES ON EDUKASHON.
REMEMBER, KIDS, KEEP HITTING THOSE BOOKS AND IF THAT DOESN'T DESTROY THEM, TRY A WOOD CHIPPER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
