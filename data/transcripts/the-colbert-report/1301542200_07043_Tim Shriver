>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CHAIRMAN
AND THE C.E.O. OF THE SPECIAL
OLYMPICS.
I HOPE HE'S READY TO TIME ME ON
MY TEN YARD DASH.
PLEASE WELCOME TIM SHRIVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, TIM, THANKS FOR COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: I'M MORALLY
OFFENDED TO HAVE A GUEST WITH
BETTER HAIR THAN I DO.
>> WE COULD HAVE A HAIR OFF.
YOU HAVE SO MUCH DBOOP IN YOURS
GGOOP IN YOURS.
>> Stephen: GOOP?
IT'S A PROTECTEDDIVE SHIELD.
I'M UNDER THESE LIGHTS ALL DAY.
YOU ARE THE CHAIRMAN AND C.E.O.
THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS.
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING
RID OF HOW PEOPLE STOP USING THE
R WORD.
WHAT IS THE R WORD?
>> IT'S THE OLD LANGUAGE WE USED
TO USE TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE WITH
INTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCES.
WE USED TO CALL THEM MENTALLY
RETARDED, RETARDS, RETARDED
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: I WOULD PREFER YOU
NOT USE THAT TERM.
>> THANK YOU.
THEN THE SHOW IS OVER.
THANKS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S HOW WE
SOLVE THING.
THIS IS MORE INTERESTING THAN
THE PAC CONVERSATION ALREADY
STPHOFRPBLGTS NOT TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG PROBLEM?
IS IT USED THAT MUCH ANYMORE?
>> I REPRESENT 3.5 MILLION
ATHLETES ALL OVER THE WORLD, 180
COUNTRIES WHERE THEY COMPETE ALL
YEAR ROUND.
THEY HAVE ONE GOAL.9รง
THEIR GOAL IS TO PLAY SPORTS AND
SHOW THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE CAN
PLAY TOGETHER, LIVE TOGETHER AND
SHOW THEM RESPECT.
THE WORD RETARD HAS BECOME THE
SYMBOL FOR THEM, NOT FOR ME BUT
FOR THEM OF THE IDEA THAT THEY
DON'T COUNT.
>> Stephen: AT ONE TIME THAT
WAS THE PROPER WORD, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE PROPER
TERM NOW?
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?
>> SAY PEOPLE FIRST.
DON'T CALL SOMEONE AUTISTIC,
RETARDED, DISABLED, INVALID.
CALL SOMEONE A PERSON WITH -- A
PERSON WITH WHAIR GOOP IN IT AS
AN EXAMPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NICE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT A GOOPY GUY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S MY
BAPTISMAL NAME.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WE SAY PEOPLE WITH
INTELLECTABILITY DISPOINT I LIKE
THE -- INTELLECTUAL
DISABILITIES.
I LIKE THE WORD DIFF-ABILITY.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAVE A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.
>> I SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE ON THIS
AND PEOPLE DON'T GET IT FOR
HOURS, WEEKS AND MONTHS.
AND YOU, BAM.
>> Stephen: CAN I HELP YOU WHY
PEOPLE USE TERMS LIKE THIS?
YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY WHO IS A
PERSON WITH INTELLECT DISABILITY
AND I SCARES YOU A LITTLE BIT.
THAT MIGHT BE MY CHILD OR ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
YOU SAY THE R WORD AT THEM TO
SAY GET AWAY FROM ME AS A PERSON
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE
PART OF MY PERSONHOOD?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: WHY TAKE AWAY THAT
PROTECTABILITY TO MAKE PEOPLE I
DON'T AGREE WITH OR ARE SCARED
OF SEEM INHUMAN?
IT'S AN EVOLUTIONARY PROTECTIVE
ABILITY THAT WE HAVE?
[LAUGHTER]
>> JON STEWART IS FUNNIER THAN
YOU BUT HE DOESN'T MAKE FUN OF
YOU ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?
[AUDIENCE REACTS] YOU DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: HE DOES A COMEDY
SHOW AND I DO A NEWS SHOW.
OKAY?
YOU SAY YOU CANNOT USE WORDS --
>> I DIDN'T SAY YOU CANNOT.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU ARE -- ISN'T THAT THOUGHT
POLICE?
>> I DON'T WANT TO HE BE A COP.
I WANT TO BE A TEACHER.
AWR LOUD TO BE HUMILIATING,
DEGRADING AND HURTFUL.
I'M APLUD TO PETITION YOU TO
RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU SAY AND ABE
AWARE OF THE OPTION YOU HAVE TO
STOP.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE ASKING
ASKING -- YOU ARE ASKING FOR
SELF AWARENESS.
>> I'M ASKING FOR SOCIAL
AWARENESS.
THIS IS A FORGOTTEN POPULATION.
I'M ASKING YOU TO LEAD A
CAMPAIGN TO SAVE AMERICA'S KIDS.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A LOT OF
INFLUENCE OVER YOUNG KIDS.
>> I KNOW YOU DO.
>> Stephen: REMEMBER MY PSA,
OKAY?
HI, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, KIDS,
DON'T USE THE R WORD.
IT IS TOTALLY GAY.
