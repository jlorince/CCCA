THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AREN'T YOU NICE!
NATION, FOLKS, ANYBODY WHO
WATCHES THIS SHOW EVERY NIGHT
KNOWS THAT I AM A HUGE FAN OF
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE AND 217th TRIMESTER
FETUS RICK SANTORUM.
TO ME, THE NAME SANTORUM IS
SYNONYMOUS WITH LEADERSHIP.
AND NOTHING ELSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT OF COURSE THE LEFT IS ALWAYS
LOOKING TO STICK A KNIFE IN THIS
GOOD MAN.
CRITICISM HE IS NOW GETTING
BECAUSE AT A FLORIDA TOWN HALL
ON MONDAY HE DID NOT CORRECT
THIS PERSON IN THE CROWD.
>> I NEVER REFER TO OWE BALM WHY
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAUSE
LEGALLY HE IS NOT.
AND HE IS AN AVOWED MUSLIM.
[ APPLAUSE ]
AND HE HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT TO BE
CALLING HIMSELF PRESIDENT.
>> STEPHEN: NOW, RICK COULD
HAVE -- I AGREE -- I AGREE
GOOOOOB JOB RICK.
HE COFFIN FORD HIM THAT OBAMA IS
NOT AN VOWED MUSLIM.
S A SECRET MUSLIM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT TODAY ON MORNING JOE WITH
JOE MORNING RICK EXPLAINS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- THAT HE HAD A GOOD EXCUSE FOR
NOT CORRECTING HER.
>> THIS WAS AN ELDERLY THERE
THERE LEANING ON A CANE, QUITE
WOBBLY.
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND
SLAM ON OLDER LADY BECAUSE SHE
HAS SOME WAY OUT, BIZARRE
BELIEFS.
>> STEPHEN: BRAVO YOU CANNOT
CORRECT AN OLD PERSON EVERY TIME
THEY SAY SOMETHING OFFENSIVE.
YOU WOULD NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH
THANKSGIVING DINNER.
AS IT IS NOW NANA GRABS HER
PURSE EVERY TIME SOMEONE OFFERS
HER DARK MEAT.
GOOD FOR YOU RICK SANTORUM FOR
RESPECTING THE ELDERLY'S RIGHT
TO SPOUT HATEFUL NONSENSE.
>> HE NEEDED SO SAY SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY SHOW BUT INS SENSE ELDERLY
YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT.
>> I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT RICK
SANTORUM RUNNING A WHITE SLAVERY
RING.
>> STEPHEN: WELL --
>> IT'S PROOF.
HE STEALS BLONDE HAIRED BLUE
EYED HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS
FROM THE CHANGING ROOM AND SELLS
THEM LIKE MEAT ON STREETS OF
BANGKOK.

>> STEPHEN: I WOULD SAY
SOMETHING BUT SHE'S GOT A CANE,
FOLKS.

>> HE HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS.
>> STEPHEN: CANE OR NO CANE I
HAVE TO CORRECT THAT.
SHE HAS TWO CANES.
I GUESS I HAVE TO LET THAT
STAND.

DIRTY LITTLE MOUTH.

ROOM AND I WANT YOU TO BEAT HER
