>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,NATION.
THANKS SO MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOUKNOW THE HISTORY OF THIS SHOW IS
COMES AS NO SURPRISE TO YOU ILOVE THE OLYMPICS.
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW TIMES YOUCAN THROW A SPEAR IN A STADIUM
AND NOT GET ARREST FORWARD IT.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
FOLKS-- THANK YOU, THAT ONE'SFREE.
THAT'S FREE.
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE UPCOMING WIRPTDQAIMS IN SOCHI, RUSSIA.
I EVEN LEARNED SOME RUSSIAN LIKE"DOSVEDANYA."
WHICH MEANS "TWO VEDANYAS."
AND "VOHTA-KA," WHICH I BELIEVEMEANS I'D LIKE TO WANG NEED IN
THE NEAREST FOUNTAIN, PLEASE.
BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE.
AND FOR ALL THESE OLYMPICS,RUSSIA IS PROMISING
UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES.
NOSSURPRISING, OF COURSE, GIVENALL THE THREATS THE COUNTRY
FACES-- CHECHEN REBELS, KAZAKHFUNDAMENTALISTS, RIDING PUSSY.
BUT THERE'S ONE GROUP THAT'SMORE DANGEROUS THAN ALL OF THOSE
COMBINED-- THE GAYS.
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
NO, NO, WE'RE ALL SCARED.
( LAUGHTER )RUSSIA'S OLYMPICS ARE ENDANGERED
BY HOMOSEXUALS WHO INSIST ONEXISTING DURING THEM.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S WHY LAST JUNE, VLADIMIR
PUTIN SIGNED A LAW BANNING ALLHOMOSEXUAL PROPAGANDA, INCLUDING
PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION, ORDISPLAYING SYMBOLS LIKE A
RAINBOW FLACK.
GOOD THINKING.
BECAUSE THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM HASALWAYS HAD A GAY AGENDA.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I MEAN, IT EXPLAINS WHY WE'REALWAYS HEARING ABOUT ROY G. BIV,
BUT NEVER MRS.  G. BIV.
WHERE IS SHE, ROY?
SOME IN THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY,WHICH CONSIDER STANDS FOR
SOMETHING-SOMETHING-SOMETHING-TE
SOMETHING-SOMETHING-SOMETHING-TERRORIST, ARE THREATENING TO
STAGE A GAY-IN.
>> THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ABUTTINGPROTEST MOVEMENTS AGAINST THE
WINTER OLYMPICS BECAUSE OF THEHOMOPHOBIC STANCE OF PUTINS AND
THE RUSSIAN LAWS.
>> THERE SHOULD BE WEARING OFRAINBOW COLORS.
THERE SHOULD BE PROTESTS.
THERE SHOULD BE MORE SPEECH.
>> AN OPENLY GAY SPADE SKATERWANTS TO GO THERE, WEAR A
RAINBOW PIN AND SAY, "I'M HERE,I'M GAY, AND I'M OKAY."
>> HEY, BLAKE, DO YOU REALLYTHINK YOU NEED TO WEAR A RAINBOW
PIN WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THE MANSPANX.
WE GET THE MESSAGE.
FORTUNATELY, RUSSIAN OLYMPICOFFICIALS HAVE COME UP WITH A
FOOL-PROOF WAY TO MAKE THEOLYMPIC TORCH A LITTLE LESS
FLAMING.
>> PICTURES SHOWING THE OFFICIALUNIFORM FOR VOLUNTEERS AND
STAFF, BRIGHTLY COLORED SKIJABTS AND HATS FEATURING THE
OLYMPIC RING.
SOME PEOPLE SAY COLORS VERYSIMILAR TO THE RAINBOW FLAG THAT
SYMBOLIZES THE L.G.B.T.
MOVEMENT.
>> Stephen:  YES, BY WEARINGTHESE RAINBOW UNIFORMS, THE
RUSSIANS ARE LEAVING THE GAYSWITH NO PROTEST SYMBOL.
AS PRESIDENT OF THE OLYMPICORGANIZES COMMITTEE
CHERNYSHENKO, TOLD "USA TODAY,"I AM VERY BRAVE, I WILL PUT MY
RAINBOW PIN ON AND LET ME GO TOJAIL IN RUSSIA BECAUSE I WILL BE
PROMOTING GAY RIGHT IN THEOLYMPIC GAME.
HAS ANYBODY NOTICED WHAT KIND OFUNIFORM GAME ORGANIZERS WILL BE
WEARING?
YES, WE TOOK YOUR RAINBOW.
SUCK IT, GAYS.
JUST-- JUST DON'T DO IT INRUSSIA.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NOW, WHEN SOMEONE WATCHING THEOLYMPICS SEES RAINBOW CLOACTING,
THEY WON'T THINK THEY'RE A GAYPROTESTER.
THEY'RE JUST THINK THEY HAVETERRIBLE TASTE.
BRAVO, RUSSIA NO COUNTRY HASNEUTRALIZED THEN HITLER ONE-UPS
JESSE OWENS BY WEARING BLACKFACE.
I AGREE, NOT COOL, HITLER, NOTCOOL.
I'M SORRY, THIS IS WHERE I GETOFF.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
