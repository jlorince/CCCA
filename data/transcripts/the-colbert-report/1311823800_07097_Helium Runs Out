[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'VE SAID THIS QUITE A FEW TIMES
ON THIS SHOW BEFORE SO IT
SHOULDN'T COME AS ANY SURPRISE,
I'M NO FAN OF PERIODIC TABLE.
IF YOU ASK ME, NOBLE GASES ARE
JUST ELITIST ELEMENTS.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK HOW CRUELLY THEY EXCLUDED
UNUNOCTIUM.
NO WONDER HE'S SO UNSTABLE!
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF
HELIUM, BECAUSE I LOVE
LIGHTER-THAN-AIR TRAVEL.
EVERY SUMMER I LOAD THE FAMILY
INTO THE ZEPPELIN AND THE KIDS
ASK: "WHERE ARE WE GOING, DADDY?
WHEN WILL WE GET THERE?"
AND MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE
SAME: "DOWNWIND, AND
EVENTUALLY."
[LAUGHTER]
SADLY, THE GOLDEN ERA OF
DIRIGIBLES MAY SOON BE ENDING.
>> IT APPEARS THE CLOCK IS
TICKING ON HELIUM, THE GAS WE
-- THE U.S. HELIUM RESERVE SAYS
IT COME RUN IN BY 2020.
THE AGENCY IS THE SOURCE OF
ALMOST HALF THE U.S. HELIUM
SUPPLY, MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE
WORLD'S.
IT'S NOT A RENEWABLE RESOURCE SO
ONCE IT'S GONE IT'S GONE.
>> Stephen:  OUR HELIUM SUPPLY
IS RUNNING OUT!
AND WE HAVE NO OTHER SOURCE OF
HELIUM -- OTHER THAN HUNTING
BALLOONS IN THE WILD.
BUT THEY'RE HARD TO CATCH, AS
SEEN IN THIS CLASSIC FRENCH
NATURE DOCUMENTARY.
AND THANKS TO THEIR NATURAL
CAMOUFLAGE ABILITIES, THEY CAN
DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS ALMOST
ANY ANIMAL:
DOG,
GIRAFFE,
OR EVEN A SNAKE.
NO, JIMMY, THE BALLOON VERSIONS,
NOT THE REAL ONES!
WHAT?
WOW, THEY'RE GOOD.
THIS HELIO-CRISIS HITS HOME FOR
ME BECAUSE I HAVE A SERIOUS
MEDICAL CONDITION.
DUE TO THE MASSIVE SIZE OF MY
BALLS, MY NATURAL VOICE IS
EXTREMELY LOW.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR HELIUM
TO MAINTAIN THIS PITCH YOU HEAR
NOW
LET ME SHOW YOU.
[IN A VERY LOW VOICE]
THIS IS HOW I NORMALLY TALK.
IT'S DANGEROUS.
IF I HIT WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE
BROWN NOTE, IT CAN CAUSE HUMANS
TO VOID THEIR BOWELS.
[LAUGHTER]
AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES TO DORIS
KERNS GOODWIN.
LET ME CRANK MYSELF BACK UP.
[SOUNDING NORMAL]
AHH, THAT'S BETTER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LUCKILY, I'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR
JUST SUCH A SHORTAGE.
WHICH IS WHY LAST YEAR, I BOUGHT
MY OWN STRATEGIC RESERVE OF
HELIUM-FILLED BALLOONS.
WHAT NO!
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY WERE FULL JUST LAST MONTH!
NOOOOOOOO--
--OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
NOT MY BALLOONS!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
