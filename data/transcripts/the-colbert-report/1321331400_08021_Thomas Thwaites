LONDON IN A SUITCASE AND
THEN BUILT THIS FURNACE.

AFRAID THAT YOU ARE TRYING
TO GET IRON AND SMELT IT AND
GET ALL THESE LITTLE BITS
AND PIECES THAT YOU MIGHT
END UP ON A TERROR WATCH
LIST?
>> THERE WERE A FEW TIMES,
ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I'M
BUILDING A TOAST CERTIFICATE
NOT THAT BELIEVABLE.
SO YOU GOT YOUR IRON BUT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE.

FAILED.
THAT WAS THE 16th CENTURY
WAY AND THEN I FOUND A
PATENT ON-LINE FOR
INDUSTRIAL FURNACES THAT USE
MICROWAVES AND I THOUGHT
