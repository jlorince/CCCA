PLAY SPORTS, I GO BALLS-OUT.
ALSO WHEN I WATCH SPORTS.
AND I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO MY
GUESTS FOR DOUBLE-DIPPING AT
LAST YEAR'S SUPER BOWL PARTY.
THIS IS "THE SPORT REPORT."
[SCATTING]
GONG.
FIRST UP... FIRST UP, BIG NEWS
FOR FROM WORLD CUP SOCCER.
WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT IT
ANYMORE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[VUVUZELA SOUNDS]
I CAN WAIL.
NEXT UP BASKETBALL.
FOLKS...
[LAUGHTER]
THIS THURSDAY LeBRON JAMES
BEGINS HIS FREE AGENCY, AND HE'S
BEING COURTED BY CHICAGO, MIAMI,
DALLAS, NEW JERSEY AND THE L.A.
CLIPPERS.
OF COURSE, ACCORDING TO THE NBA
RULES, THOSE TEAMS CAN ONLY
OFFER HIM $95 MILLION OVER FIVE
YEARS, WHILE HIS CURRENT TEAM,
THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS, CAN
GIVE HIM $125 MILLION OVER SIX
YEARS.
MEANING WE WILL SOON HAVE THE
ANSWER TO THE ETERNAL QUESTION:
WOULD ANYONE CHOOSE TO LIVE IN
CLEVELAND FOR $30 MILLION?
LAUGHTER LAUGHTER
CLEVELAND IS NOT LEAVING
ANYTHING TO CHANCE, FOLKS.
THEY HAVE GATHERED SOME OF THE
CITY'S BRIGHTEST STARS TO WOO
LeBRON IN SONG.
♪ PLEASE STAY LeBRON
WE REALLY NEED YOU ♪♪
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE GOT TO
RESPECT A TOWN WILLING TO
COMPARE LOSING A BASKETBALL STAR
TO CHILD FAMINE IN AFRICA.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE CITY FIT
FOR KING JAMES -- NEW YORK, NEW
YORK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHICH IN THE PAST HAS ALSO SHOWN
EVIDENCE OF HAVING A BASKETBALL
TEAM.
THE KNICKS, WHO, TO MAKE SPACE
FOR LeBRON JAMES AND HIS
SALARY, HAVE RELEASED OR TRADED
AWAY SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY
ONLY HAVE FIVE PLAYERS UNDER
CONTRACT FOR THE NEXT SEASON.
SO IF THEY DO LAND LeBRON,
THEY'LL NEED TO FILL OUT THEIR
ROSTER WITH PLAYERS WILLING TO
WORK FOR CHEAP.
LUCKILY FOR THEM MY MEMBERSHIP
WITH NEW YORK SPORTS CLUB JUST
EXPIRED, AN I'M LOOKING FOR A
NEW GYM.
THIS IS A "SPORT REPORT" SPECIAL
REPORT: BASKET CASE.
HOOP-DE-DOO.
I ARRIVED AT THE TEAM'S TRAINING
CENTER READY TO SHOW OFF MY
AWESOME BALL-HANDLING SKILLS.
I SAT DOWN WITH KNICKS' HEAD
COACH MIKE D'ANTONI.
COACH, THANKS FOR TALKING TO ME
TODAY.
LET ME START OFF BY SAYING I'M A
HUGE FAN.
I LOVE THE TEAM.
>> SUPER.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DO I NEED
TO DO TO GET ME IN A... WHAT
COLOR IS YOUR JERSEY?
>> WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS.
>> Stephen: WHAT COLOR IS A
GOOD ONE?
>> THAT WOULD BE ORANGE.
>> Stephen: ORANGE.
>> ORANGE IS GOOD.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO I NEED TO
DO TO GET INTO THAT ORANGE
JERSEY.
>> ATHLETIC ABILITY.
>> Stephen: TOUGH ONE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU
THIS, WHEN YOU LOOK FOR A
PLAYER, HOW MUCH OF IT IS SKILLS
AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS
INTANGABLES, LIKE GREAT HAIR AND
A BRILLIANT SMILE?
>> MOSTLY SKILL.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
AGAIN, LET'S PUT ATHLETIC
ABILITY AND CONDITIONING.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND YOUTH.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND TEAMWORK.
>> RIGHT.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: AND WHAT ELSE?
>> WELL, WE'RE LOOKING FOR
SHOOTERS.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR GUYS WHO PLAY
HARD.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR GUYS WHO ARE
SERIOUS, WHO ARE WINNERS.
>>
>> Stephen: I WANT IT.
I'M HUNGRY.
>> WE HAVE TO TRANSLATE THAT
INTO WINNING.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT TRYING?
WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING.
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU HAVE
TO WIN.
>> Stephen: WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY
THAT THIS YEAR?
>> WE DID TRY.
WE DO TRY TO WIN.
SOMETIMES IT MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE
IT.
>> Stephen: HUH.
ALL RIGHT.
BIG PICTURE, WHAT IS A KNICKER
BALKER.
I GUESS ME QUESTION IS, DO THEY
REALLY LIKE TO BE CALLED THAT?
BECAUSE I'M UNCOMFORTABLE IN
2010 CALLING THEM A
KNICKERBOCKER.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BEFORE I GET ON
BOARD, AND OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T
A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME, WHAT'S
YOUR "DON'T ASK DON'T TELL"
POLICY.
>> EXACTLY THAT.
WE DON'T ASK.
>> Stephen: AND YOU DON'T
TELL.
>> WE DON'T TELLMENT
>> Stephen: GOOD.
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS AND
CERTAINLY NONE OF YOURS.
>> IS IT GROUP SHOWERS OR
INDIVIDUAL SHOWERS.
>> Stephen: IT'S BOTH.
SO IT'S JUST HOW YOUR FEELING?
IF WE WON GAME, MAYBE IT'S A
GROUP SHOWERMENT
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: IF WE LOSE THE
GAME, I'M SOAPING UP MYSELF.
>> SINCE I'M COACHING...
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T COACH
ANYBODY UP?
>> I DON'T GO TO THE DRESSING
ROOM.
THAT'S KIND OF THEIR SPACE.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
TALK ABOUT THE SALARY CAP I HEAR
A LOT ABOUT THAT.
WHAT IS IT AND WHO GETS TO WEAR
IT?
>> IT'S NOT REALLY A CAP.
IT'S NOT A CAP.
IT'S LIKE PUTTING A LID ON
SALARIES, TEAM SALARIES.
>> Stephen: LET ME SEE IF I
GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU GOT A LOT OF EXTRA SALARY
LAYING AROUND RIGHT NOW.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
HERE'S AN IDEA.
TAKE ALL THIS MONEY.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: AND YOU BUY SEASON
TICKETS TO THE LAKERS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT TEAM IS ELECTRIC.
HAVE YOU SEEN KOBE PLAY?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AMAZING.
OR THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS.
>> THEY'RE GOOD.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH LeBRON JAMES.
>> HE'S GOOD.
>> Stephen: VERY GOOD.
SO ARE YOU GUYS HOPING TO GET
LeBRON JAMES?
>> CAN'T ANSWER THAT ONE.
WE HAVE TRYOUTS.
WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
HOW GREAT WOULD BIT TO GET
LeBRON JAMES?
HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE?
>> I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: I KNOW YOU CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT.
WHAT'S TO TALK ABOUT?
HE'S NOT THAT GOOD.
IT'S ALL HYPE.
IT'S JUST GRACEFUL, ATHLETICISM,
AGGRESSIVE, DESIRE TO WIN.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: GIANTS STADIUM
FILLING DUNKS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'S IT.
AFTER THIS HE'S KIND OF AN EMPTY
SUIT.
ALL RIGHT.
ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME BEFORE WE
GET OUT THERE?
>> WELL, BESIDES WE NEED TO SEE
YOU PERFORM ACTUALLY ON THE
COURT, AND WE NEED TO...
>> Stephen: THAT'S A FORMALITY
AT THIS POINT.
>> A LITTLE BITMENT BUT WE NEED
TO GO THROUGH THAT.
WE HAVE A CHECKLIST.
>> Stephen: SO I ACTUALLY HAVE
TO PLAY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: MY UNDERSTANDING
IS YOU HAVE A PLAYER THAT'S GOT
AN $11 MILLION A YEAR DEAL AND
DOES NOT PLAY BASKETBALL FOR
YOU.
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE.
>> Stephen: HE PLAYED 60
MINUTES LAST YEAR.
FOR $11 MILLION THAT.
IS THE CONTRACT I WOULD LIKE.
I WILL PLAY NO BASKETBALL FOR $5
MILLION.
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.
YOU JUST MADE $6 MILLION OFF ME.
CAN YOU AD FOR NOT TO HIRE ME AT
THIS POINT?
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY
IT'S INTERESTING.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ONE THING I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL
YOU ABOUT IN ALL FAIRNESS.
I HAVE A BIG OF AN ARM PROBLEM.
>> WHAT'S THE ARM PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: THAT HURTS.
IS THERE A LOT OF THIS ACTION IN
BASKETBALL?
>> A LITTLE BIT.
>> Stephen: AND THIS HURTS,
TOO.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: THAT HURTS.
>> THAT'S TOUGH.
>> Stephen: AND THAAAAA... UH.
FULL EXTENSION IS VERY TOUGH IS.
THAT GOING TO HOLD ME BACK.
>> YOU'RE NOT IN GREAT SHAPE IS
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME.
>> Stephen: SOME OF IT IS
HEART, RIGHT.
>> HEART AND ATTITUDE.
BUT WE NEED TO SEE YOU ON THE
COURT.
>> Stephen: LET'S DO IT.
>> GOT TO GET YOU DRESSED.
>> Stephen: FIRST STOP THE
LEGENDARY KNICKS' LOCKER ROOM.
I HAD A FEELING I WAS GOING TO
FIT RIGHT IN.
