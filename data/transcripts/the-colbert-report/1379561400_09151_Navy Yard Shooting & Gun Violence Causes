>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, I'VE GOT TO TAKE MOMENT
HERE AND WE HAVE NOT TALKEDABOUT THIS YET ON THE SHOW BUT I
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND SPEAKABOUT MONDAY'S TRAGIC SHOOTING
IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. NAVALYARD.
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUTTO THE VICTIMS AND THE FAMILIES
AND I'D LIKE TO SALUTE D.C.'SFIRST RESPONDERS WHO PREVENTED
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN EVENBIGGER TRAGEDY.
AND, FOLKS, AFTER WATCHINGWALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE I HAVE TO
SAY I'VE REASSESSED SOME OF MYLONG-HELD OPINIONS.
WHILE WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHATMOTIVATED THE SHOOTER, WE KNOW
HE HAD A TROUBLED AND VIOLENTPAST AND EVIDENCE OF MENTAL
ILLNESS.
SO IT'S TIME TO ADMIT-- ALL OFUS-- THAT SOME DANGEROUS ITEMS
SHOULDN'T FALL INTO THE HANDS OFTHE DISTURBED.
>> HOW MANY TRAGEDIES SHOULD WEWITNESS BEFORE WE FINALLY ENACT
COMMON SENSE GUN VIOLENCEPREVENTION?
>> Stephen: WHAT?
NO, NOT GUNS!
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT GUNS AFTER SANDY HOOK!
GUNS?
YOU'RE ADORABLE!
(LAUGHTER)BUT FOR THE LAST TIME, GUNS HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH GUN VIOLENCE!
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE REALPROBLEM IS!
THIS IS A MILITARY I.D. CARD.
THIS IS HOW YOU GET ON AMILITARY BASE.
SO HOW DID HE GET ON?
AGAIN, IN MY VIEW, HE HAD ANAUTHORIZED CARD.
>> MAYBE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVETHESE CARDS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: THINK ABOUT IT: HI
HAD ACCESS TO A MILITARY I.D.
CARD.
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT, WEWOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT A
TRAGEDY AT THE NAVY YARD, WE'DBE TALKING ABOUT A TRAGEDY IN A
LESS-SECURE AREA LIKE A PARK ORA DENNY'S.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WHAT'S THE ANSWER.
>> WE NEED TO START DOING MOREEXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS ON
CONTRACTORS.
>> WHY DID BACKGROUND CHECKS NOTOCCUR?
>> THERE ARE GAPS NOW INSECURITY BACKGROUND CHECKS.
>> WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGHBACKGROUND CHECKS.
>> YES, HOW MANY TIMES DOCONSERVATIVES NEED TO SAY IT?
WE NEED MORE BACKGROUND CHECKS!
(LAUGHTER)OR AT LEAST A WAITING PERIOD FOR
AN I.D. LIKE THEY HAVE AT THED.M.V.
(LAUGHTER)I BELIEVE IT'S THREE DAYS.
AT LEAST WE ALL KNOW WHAT DROVETHIS MADMAN TO GO OUT AND GET
THAT I.D. CARD.
>> HE HAD AN OBSESSION WITHSHOOTING VIDEO GAMES.
>> SOMETIMES PLAYED VIOLENTVIDEO GAMES ALL NIGHT LONG.
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN.
REPORT NATION VI YARD SHOOTERAARON ALEXIS LIKED TO PLAY
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES.
>> THIS, INDEED, IS A STRONGLINK TO MASS KILLINGS THEN WHY
AREN'T WE LOOKING AT FREQUENCYOF PURCHASES PER PERSON AND ALSO
HOW OFTEN THEY'RE PLAYING?
>> YES, NEW GRETCHEN IS RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
NEEDS TO MONITOR WHO IS PLAYINGVIDEO GAMES AND HOW MUCH.
MAYBE A NATIONAL GAME REGISTRY.
I MEAN, I'M REALLY CONCERNEDABOUT THIS GUY NAMED:AAAH!"
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HE'S THE HIGH SCORER WHEREVER
YOU LOOK!
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME FROM'SBEEN NO PROVEN LINK BETWEEN
VIDEO GAMES AND VIOLENCE!
MADDEN 25 JUST CAME OUT ANDSUDDENLY THERE'S A RASH OF
FOOTBALL VIOLENCE ON T.V.!
(LAUGHTER)BUT, OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE
AGREES.
TAKE FOX'S THE FIVE ERICBOLLING.
>> WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN VIDEOGAMES?
IT'S VIOLENT, YEAH, IT'SVIOLENT.
BUT SO ARE MOVIES, SO ISTELEVISION.
WHO'S THE JACKASS TO WHO STARTEDPOINTING FINGER AT VIDEO GAMES?
>> Stephen: GOOD QUESTION.
WHO IS THE JACKASS WHO BLAMESGUN VIOLENCE ON VIDEO GAMES.
>> IT'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS.
MENTAL HEALTH, GUNS, VIDEOGAMES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.
TELEVISION IS VIOLENT.
ERIC BOLLING JUST KICKED HIMSELFIN THE BALLS!
