EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN CALLED
THE FATHER OF REGGAE MUSIC.
HE IS GOING TO BE UPSET WHEN I
TELL HIM WHAT HIS KIDS HAVE BEEN
SMOKING.
PLEASE WELCOME JIMMY CLIFF.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THEY ARE HAPPY TO SEE ME
TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
SIR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
I'M A HUGE FAN.
TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING.
YOU HAVE A NEW ALBUM COMING OUT
THIS FALL, TRUE?
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> WHAT IS IT CALLED?
>> IT'S CALLED "EXISTENCE"
>> Stephen: THAT'S A BIG
SUBJECT.
>> A BIG SUBJECT.
>> Stephen: IT'S A DOUBLE
ALBUM I HOPE.
>> QUITE A FEW TRACKS ON IT.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF
EXISTENCE, YOU HAVE STUDIED
EXISTENCE IN YOUR LIFE, THROUGH
YOUR ART.
YOU'VE JOINED MANY RELIGIONS.
WHICH ONE IS BEST?
WHICH ONE WON?
>> I ACTUALLY STUDIED THEM ALL.
I NEVER SAY I WOULD JOIN THEM
ALL.
BUT I STUDIED THEM ALL.
>> Stephen: AND SO ARE YOU NOW
A MEMBER OF A RELIGION?
>> NEW YORK I HAVE GRADUATED
FROM THEM.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GRADUATED
FROM RELIGION?
>> YES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELL, YOU KNOW,
EVENTUALLY, SIR, WE DWRAJ --
GRABLG WAIT FROM LIFE AND GOD
HAS A LITTLE SCORECARD, WHICH
ONE DO YOU WANT TO BE GRADED ON,
CHRISTIAN, JEW, MUSLIM?
>> PUT ME ON THE SCORECARD OF
TRUTH AND FACTS.
>> Stephen: TRUTH AND FACTS?
>> I'LL TAKE FAITH AND GRACE.
BUT I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
I LOVE REGGAE MUSIC.
IT'S ALL ABOUT REVOLUTION,
PERSONAL AND POLITICAL
REVOLUTION.
>> POLITICAL, SOCIAL, SPIRITUAL.
>> Stephen: I THINK IT'S THE
PERFECT MUSIC FOR LIKE A
CORPORATE RETREAT.
YOU KNOW, PUT ON BOB MARLEY'S
"UPRISING" AND MOTIVATE YOUR
TEAM TO UPRISE AGAINST THE
COMPETITION.
>> WHY NOT?
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
>> Stephen: YOU GREW UP IN
JAMAICA, CORRECT?
>> YES, I DID.
>> Stephen: I LOVE JAMAICA.
I HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE SO MANY
TIMES.
I'VE BEEN THERE ON THE CELEBRITY
CRUISELINE AND THE CARNIVAL
CRUISE LINE AND NORWEGIAN CRUISE
LINE.
IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL FROM THE
DOCK.
>> WELL, IN THE LIGHT, IT'S MUCH
MORE BEAUTIFUL IN THE LIGHT.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN THE DARK
YOU DON'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS.
YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE BEACHES.
>> Stephen: I MEANT FROM THE
DOCK, LIKE WHERE THE SHIP IS
DOCKING.
YOU WERE GIVING ME THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT THAT I POSSIBLY HAD
A JAMAICAN ACT SENT, FROM THE
DARK, MAN.
I LOVE IT.
WHAT DOES IRE MEAN?
>>IRE MEANS I RULE INTERNALLY.
>> Stephen: WILL YOU R
