[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
COFOUNDER OF NO LABELS ACHE
NONPARTISAN GROUP TRYING TO GET
GOVERNMENT WORKING AGAIN.
I'LL ASK IF HE'S TRIED
REBOOTING.
PLEASE WELCOME MARK McKINNON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
SO LET'S TELL THE PEOPLE YOUR
BONEA FIDES HERE.
YOU ARE A VETERAN POLITICAL
STRATEGIST WHO WORKED FOR GEORGE
W. BUSH, YOU WORKED FOR SENATOR
McCAIN, SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC
POLITICIANS AND FAMOUSLY QUIT
THE McCAIN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO UP AGAINST
THE OBAMA CAND DAIS SIX NOW YOU
HAVE SOMETHING CALLED NO LABELS.
WHAT IS THAT?
>> AS YOU KNOW 10% OF THE
COUNTRY SUPPORTS CONGRESS.
THAT'S DOWN TO PAID STAFFERS AND
RELATIVES.
IT'S NO WONDER BECAUSE ALL THEY
ARE DOING IS FIGHTING.
THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANY WORK
DONE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S PART OF
THEIR JOB.
WE SEND THEM TO FIGHT WITH EACH
OTHER.
WE HAVE THE REPUBLICAN ARMY AND
DEMOCRATIC ARMY AND THEY MEET ON
THE FIELD OF BATTLE TO SERVEÃ§ THE
REPUBLIC.
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT CHANGE.
A SENATOR OLYMPIA SNOWE DECIDED
NOT TO RUN FOR REELECTION NOT
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS
GOING TO LOSE BUT BECAUSE SHE
WAS SURE SHE WOULD WIN AND SHE
DIDN'T WANT TO GO PAST THE DISS
MINGS.
IT'S BEEN 1,000 DAYS SINCE THEY
PASSED A BUDGET.
>> STEPHEN: IF CONGRESS GETS
SOMETHING DONE IT PROVES
GOVERNMENT CAN DO SOMETHING AND
IT'S A WIN FOR THE LIBERALS WHO
WANT GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES.
ARE YOU A LIBERAL OR A SMALL
GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE?
CHECK.
>> THE REALITY IS THAT 500,000
PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE
MOVEMENTS, STRONG REPUBLICANS,
STRONG DEMOCRATS, STRONG
INDEPENDENTS AND THEY'VE COME
TOGETHER AND PUT TOGETHER A 12
STEP PROGRAM TO REFORM CONGRESS.
>> STEPHEN: LIKE AA?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
A LOT OF SIMILARITIES.
THEY HAVE TO HAND THEMSELVES
OVER TO A HIGHER POWER.
>> EXACTLY.
>> STEPHEN: IS THAT YOU?
>>
[ LAUGHTER ]
ONE OF IDEAS IS IF THEY DON'T
PASS A BUDGET THEY DON'T GET
PAID.
WE HAD A HEARING ON THAT TODAY
IN THE SENATE.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT?
>> IF YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR JOB YOU
WOULDN'T GET PAID.
>> STEPHEN: DON'T EVEN JOKE
ABOUT THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> IF THEY DON'T PASS A BUDGET
THEY DON'T GET PAID.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S A SLIPPERY
SLOPE, SIR.
IF THEY DON'T PASS THE BUDGET
THEY DON'T GET PAID.
WHAT IS NEXT YOU DON'T GET TO
VOTE FOR MILITARY INTERVENTION
UNLESS YOU YOURSELF HAVE SERVED
IN THE MILITARY.
>> THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
I LIKE THAT.
MAKE IT A 13-STEP PROGRAM.
>> STEPHEN: HERE IS MY PROBLEM
WITH YOU NO LABEL GUYS.
LABELS ARE HANDY, OKAY?
IF I HAVE A LABEL, I KNOW
WHETHER TO AGREE WITH YOU OR
REJECT YOUR IDEAS BEFORE YOU
EVER OPEN YOUR MOUTH.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>> STEPHEN: I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT ARE YOU A DEMOCRAT OR
REPUBLICAN?
YOU'VE WORKED FOR BOTH.
>> I'M A PROGRESSIVE REPUBLICAN.
I'M TRYING TO REMAIN IN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> STEPHEN: A PROGRESS
REPUBLICAN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
>> IT'S LONELY BUT I'M FIGHTING
GOT FIGHT.
IT'S DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS
INVOLVED IN THE MOVEMENT BECAUSE
WE THINK WE SHOULD BE PUT OUR
LABELS ASIDE AND MAKE CONGRESS
WORK AGAIN.
THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANYTHING
DONE.
WE FACE OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES
EVERY AND OUR SYSTEM IS
PARALYZED BY HYPERPARTISANSHIP.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY BUT IF --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO -- BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
CLEARLY DO WANT
HYPERPARTISANSHIP BECAUSE THEY
KEEP ELECTING HYPERPART SANS.
DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW MORE THAN
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU WILL ADMIT THEY KEEP
ELECTING HYPERPART SANS.
>> THEY DO BECAUSE --
>> STEPHEN: ARE YOU CALLING
THEM DUMB?
>> WELL, THEY ARE GETTING A LOT
OF INFORMATION FROM SUPER PACS.
WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE IN
THE BROAD MIDDLE OF AMERICA A
VOICE TO COMPETE WITH THE
FRINGES WHO HAVE BIG MICROPHONES
AND TV PROGRAMS.
>> STEPHEN: YES, THEY DO.
WATCH WHERE I POINT THIS THING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DO YOU HAVE MONEY?
DO YOU HAVE CASH?
YOU HAVE TO CASH, DEEP POCKETS?
>> WE DON'T HAVE A SUPER PAC.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIAL
INTEREST MONEY.
BUT OUR 500,000, HALF A MILLION
SUPPORTERS HAVE FUNDED US, WE
HAVE A NINE MEMBER STAFF TO GET
HEARINGS LIKE THE ONE WE HAD
TODAY.
WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE A 90
DAY RULE UP-OR-DOWN VOTE ON
WHETHER A PRESIDENTIAL
APPOINTMENT CAN SERVE.
I WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT
BUSH AND FOR FOUR YEARS I
COULDN'T COULDN'T GET CONFIRMED.
>> STEPHEN: YOU WANT PEOPLE TO
COMPROMISE.
>> CONSENSUS IS NOT A SIN.
>> STEPHEN: COMPROMISE IS THE
GREATEST SIN IN AMERICA EVER
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE MO M-
COMPROMISE?
IT LED TO THE CIVIL WAR.
YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS,
SIR.
>> WE HAVE A CIVIL WAR NOW.
WE DO HAVE A CIVIL WAR AND WE'RE
TRYING TO END IT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE A
POLITICAL ANALYST.
GOOD LUCK WITH THIS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE PRIMARIES FOR A SECOND.
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF KERMI T'S
ANALYSIS?
>> HE WAS RIGHT ON.
>> STEPHEN: I THINK THAT FROG
IS WASTED IN MOVIES.
>> HE HAS A FUTURE.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE GINGRICH
DROPS OUT.
>> I THINK HE GOES TO THE
CONVENTION AND CUTS A DEAL.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
IF YOU WERE GINGRICH WHAT WOULD
YOU WANT?
DON'T SAY PROEXROA MIEZ.
>> A POSITION IN A SANTORUM
CABINET PERHAPS, VICE
PRESIDENCY.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S THE SANTORUM
PRESIDENCY.
BE STILL MY HEART.
>> HIS SNLS -- THINK ABOUT IT.
ROMNEY DOESN'T HAVE THE TELL
GATES HE NEEDS.
IT WILL GO TO A SECOND BALLOT.
HE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH FROM RON
PAUL SO HE HAS TO GET THEM FROM
GINGRICH OR SANTORUM.
NEITHER WOULD GIVE THEM TO
ROMNEY.
ONE OF THE TWO OF THOSE IS MORE
LIKELY GIVEN THAT SCENARIO COULD
BE PRESIDENT.
>> STEPHEN: DO YOU THINK WE
MIGHT HAVE A SANTORUM RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?
>> IT'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY,
SURE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT IS FUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
COFOUNDER OF NO LABELS, MARK
