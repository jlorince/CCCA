DESOLATE WASTELAND LIKE HOUSTON.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SO, WILL NORTH KOREA ATTACK AMERICA?
OR WILL WE BOMB THEM FORWARD INTO THE STONE AGE?
WHO CAN SAY?
HERE TO SAY IS GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR OF "THE IMPOSSIBLE STATE,"
VICTOR CHA.
MR. CHA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU WROTE THE BOOK ON THE REGIME HERE IN NORTH KOREA "THE IMPOSSIBLE STATE." SHOULD I ACTUALLY BE FRIGHTENED
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NORTH KOREA?
IS IT LIKE AH HE'S CRAZY OR AHHH HE'S CRAZY?
>> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE OF BOTH.
ON THE ONE HAND HE HAS DONE A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT LOOK HARMLESS BUT
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE DEVELOPING WEAPONS, LONG RANGE MISSILES, NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
TRYING TO DEVELOP A CAPABILITY TO REACH THE UNITED STATES.
THEY CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THEY WANT TO DO THAT AND THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING THEM.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THEIR END GAME?
THEY WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WE WOULD TURN NIGHT A PARKING LOT IF THEY ATTACKED US?
RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND IF WE DID, COULD WE TELL?
>> THEY UNDERSTAND THAT AND FOR THAT REASON THEY'VE BEEN DETERRED FROM STARTING ANOTHER
WAR BUT IF THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS THEY CAN DO THINGS LIKE PROLIFERATE THEM TO OTHERS, SELL
THEM LIKE THEY SELL OTHER WEAPONRY AND COERCE OTHER NATIONS BY USING THE THREAT OF
BEING THE NEWEST NUCLEAR WEAPON STATE TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.
>> Stephen: IS THE IDEA THAT THE UNITED STATES IS THE ENEMY OF NORTH KOREA IS THAT GENERAL
THROUGHOUT THE NORTH KOREAN POPULATION OR JUST FROM THE LEADER?
>> IT'S EVERYBODY.
CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT FROM A YOUNG AGE THE AMERICANS ARE THE ENEMY.
THEY ARE TAUGHT TO COUNT TO COUNT TWO PLUS TWO DEAD AMERICANS EQUALS FOUR DEAD AMERICANS.
THEY ARE TAUGHT FROM AN EARLY AGE.
THE IDENTITY IS THAT THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA ARE THE ENEMY.
>> Stephen: CAN'T CHINESE HELP US OUT HERE?
THEY KNOW IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO US, THEY'LL NEVER GET THEIR MONEY BACK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THAT IS TRUE AND THE CHINESE HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE.
THEY ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT GIVES FOOD AND FUEL AND ANY SORT OF ASSISTANCE TO NORTH KOREA.
THE PROBLEM IS THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW THIS.
THEY KNOW CHINA DOESN'T WANT NORTH KOREA TO COLLAPSE.
THEY KIND OF HAVE CHINA BY THE YOU KNOW WHATS?
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT.
WHAT DO THEY HAVE THEM BY.
>> BY THE CHOPSTICKS, IF YOU WILL.
AND SO FOR THIS REASON --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WANT FROM US?
>> THEY WANT FOOD, THEY WANT MONEY, THEY WANT ENERGY ASSISTANCE, ALL OF THINGS THAT
WERE PART OF THE PREVIOUS TWO AGREEMENTS THAT THE UNITED STATES DID IN 1994.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THIS LIKE A KID ACTING UP.
SHOULDN'T WE JUST TOUGH LOVE.
LET THEM CRY IT OUT.
WHAT IS THE WORSE THAT THE COULD HAPPEN?
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS DOING RIGHT NOW.
THEY HAVE SAID WE'RE NOT TALKING UNTIL THEY BEHAVE BETTER AND IN THE MEANTIME THEY ARE RAMPING UP
THE MILITARY EQUATION ON THE PENINSULA IN THE HOPES THAT THE NORTH KOREANS REALIZE IF THEY
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE RED LINE IS WE'LL DRAW IT FOR THEM WITH THE B-2'S AND F-22'S WE'VE BEEN SENDING.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE'RE GOING TO WAR WITH NORTH KOREA?
>> I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO WAR.
>> Stephen: I WOULD SIGN UP IN A MINUTE I JUST WANT TO KNOW.
>> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ATTACK SOUTH KOREA AGAIN IN 1950 -- LIKE THEY DID IN 1950.
THIS FELLOW KIM DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THE EDGE IS.
HE PUSHES TO THE EDGE BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
HE COULD FALL OVER IT AND WE END UP IN AN INADVERTENT ESCALATION.
>> Stephen: IF WE GO TO WAR, WOULD YOU COME BACK AND WATCH ME PLAY YOUR PREDICTION THAT THERE
WOULDN'T BE ONE?
[LAUGHTER]
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: VICTOR CHA, THE BOOK IS "THE IMPOSSIBLE STATE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
