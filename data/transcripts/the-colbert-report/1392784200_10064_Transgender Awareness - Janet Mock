THEIR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING.

COLOR AND THE TRANS COMMUNITY ATLARGE.
THEY DEAL WITH DAILY ACCESSISSUES, LIKE BEING ABLE TO

IS AN AMAZING MOMENT.
AND I ALSO THINK THAT-- AND YOUALSO ARE JUST ASKING HOW
DO PEOPLE WANT TO IDENTIFY.
THOSE 50 FACEBOOK GENDER MARKERS--

>> YES YOU IDENTIFY AS A GUY.
AND I THINK ASKING PEOPLE -->> Stephen:  DO I HAVE A NAME?
>> DO YOU IDENTIFY AS A MAN?
>> Stephen:  I DO, BABY.
>> I THINK THE FIRST STEP ISASKING PEOPLE HOW THEY IDENTIFY?
WE RESPECT THEIR FREEDOM TOSELF-IDENTIFY.

YOU MEET END UP BEING ABOUT THATOTHER PERSON?
>> WELL -->> Stephen:  I WANT THE
CONVERSATION TO BE ABOUT ME?

ASSUMPTION.

OF.
>> THEY, THEM.
I USUALLY USE IT "THEY."
>> Stephen:  FOR A SINGLEPERSON?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  THAT SOUNDS WAYTOO MUCH LIKE WHAT SHALL I CALL
YOU?
AND THE DEMON SAYS WE ARE LEGIONBECAUSE WE ARE MANY.
THAT SETS OFF ALARM BELLS IN MYHEAD.
>> FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S HOWTHEY WANT TO IDENTIFY AND IT
FREES US FROM MAKINGASSUMPTIONS.
>> Stephen:  HELP ME OUT.
I SELF-IDENTIFY AS JUST ANAVERAGE JOE SIX PACK.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen:  WHEN I GREW UP,WHEN I GREW UP, YOU HAD AN INNIE
OR AN OUTIE.
IT WAS LIKE A BELLYBUTTON, OKAY?
>> OKAY, OKAY.
>> Stephen:  I'M AT SEA HERE.
I'M COMPLETELY AT SEA IN THE NEWWORLD.
I MIGHT BE TOO OLD TO LEARN THISNEW STUFF.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
>> I THINK THIS IS ACONVERSATION ABOUT GENDER, AND I
THINK OUR GENDERS ARE AS UNIQUEAS WE ARE.
MY FATHER HAD A VERY BLACK ANDWHITE IDEA OF GENDER, MEN DO
THIS, GIRLS DO THIS.
WOMEN DO THIS, BOYS DO THAT.
FOR ME I WAS FORCED TO FOLLOWALL OF HIS RULES.
I WAS A BABY WHO WAS ASSIGNEDMALE AT BIRTH AND TOLD I NEEDED
TO ACT LIKE A BOY.
>> Stephen:  IF I HAVE A BABYAND SEE CERTAIN GENITALS-- I
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ANY OFTHE ROUGH STUFF-- I MIGHT SAY
THAT'S A BOY.
AM I DOING THE WRONG THING BYDOING THAT?
SHOULD I JUST CALL A BABY "IT."
UNTIL IT'S OLD ENOUGH TO FILETAXES?
>> OR "THEY" OR "MY CHILD" OR"MY KID."
>> Stephen:  WOULD YOU LIKETHIS TO TO BE NOT A BIG DEAL
EVENTUALLY?
>> I WOULD.
>> Stephen:  SO YOU WANT TO BELIKE THE REST OF US WHICH IS
BORING.
WHAT IS THE MOST BORING ASPECTOF BEING TRANSGENDER?
>> WHAT IS THE MOST BORINGASPECT OF BEING TRANSGENDER?
>> Stephen:  YES.
BECAUSE LIFE IS BORING.
MOSTLY IT'S THIS.
THIS IS NICE, BUT THERE'S THAT,WHICH IS BAD.
THIS IS GOOD.
BORING IS GOOD, RIGHT?
>> I THINK THE MOST BORING THINGIS TALKING TO SOMEONE ABOUT
TELLING THEM HOW I IDENTIFY.
THAT'S THE MOST BORING THING.
>> Stephen:  ARE YOU BOREDRIGHT NOW?
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS ENTIRECONVERSATION HAS BEEN ABOUT.
>> GET IT THE ( BLEEP )TOGETHER.
