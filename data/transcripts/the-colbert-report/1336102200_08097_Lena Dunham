OKAY.
NOW I WORRY ABOUT THE GIRLS IN THIS SHOW.
>> YOU WORRIED ABOUT GIRLS.
>> Stephen: I WORRY ABOUT THE GIRLS AM THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO KNOW NECESSARILY
WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES.
>> WELL, THAT'S SORT OF WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
IT IS ABOUT THAT TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHERE ARE YOU NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN AND
YOU'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A BRITNEY SPEARS LINE.

>> I HAVE WORK.
AND THEN I HAVE A DINNER THING.
AND THEN I AM BUSY TRYING TO BECOME WHO I AM.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HOW DO THESE GIRLS BECOME WHO THEY ARE?
BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO LOST.
>> WELL, I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO FOLLOW THAT PROCESS ON THE SCREEN AND IT
INVOLVES KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF WORK AND OUT OF LOVE AND
SORT OF WHETHER YOUR FRIENDSHIPS ARE SATISFYING YOU OR JUST STUCK IN THEM
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PEOPLE YOU MET IN COLLEGE TESTIMONY IS A REALLY SEARCHING TIME
AND WE ARE WILL LOOKING AT THAT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU STILL IN THAT AGE.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE WRITING ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
>> SO I MIGHT NEVER BECOME WHO I AM.
>> Stephen: RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WRITING ABOUT IT AND NEVER HAVE TIME
TO ACTUALLY BE THE THING THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
>> THAT IS 100% TRUE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SO SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?
>> I WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT ME UNTIL RECENTLY.
>> Stephen: WHEN YOU CAME ON THE SHOW.
>> WHEN I CAME ON THE SHOW,
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT ME.
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET UP TO THE KINDS OF SHENANIGANS THAT THESE GIRLS
ARE CONDUCTING.
>> Stephen: DO YOU DO THE SEX?
>> I-- BECAUSE ON THE SHOW,
THIS IS WHAT WORRIES ME MOST IS THAT ON THE SHOW YOUR CHARACTER DOES THE SEX WITH ADAM, RIGHT?
>> SHE DOES THE SEX WITH ADAM.
I'VE NEVER DONE THE SEX SO I WRITE ABOUT WHAT I THINK THE SEX WOULD BE LIKE.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE NEVER DONE THE SEX.

>> Stephen: IT IS GREAT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> SEE I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU FIRST.
>> Stephen: I WILL DRAW A LITTLE DIAGRAM FIRST.
>> OH, OKAY, THAT'S NOT HOW IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME.
>> Stephen: WELL IF SOMEBODY DOES IT DIFFERENTLY, GET OUT OF THERE.
DO YOU THINK THAT, IS THE SHOW, PEOPLE MAKE THIS SORT OF FAST BALL KIND OF LIKE OH
IT'S SEX IN THE CITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNGER.
>> YEAH, I MEAN I THINK THAT THE SHOW IS DEFINITELY OWES A DEBT TO SEX IN THE CITY
BECAUSE SEX AND THE CITY BUSTED THE SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE IN TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES.
>> Stephen: I'M A CHARLOTTE.
>> I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT.
>> Stephen: WHO WOULD I BE,
WITHOUT WOULD I BE IN GIRLS.
>> I THINK HONESTLY ARE YOU A SCHSHAWNA AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING TO YOU.
>> Stephen: IT DOES, IT DOES.
>> YOU ARE A SCHSHAWNA.
>> A JUICY SWEAT SUIT WEARING SELF-HELP LOVING GIRL FROM LONG ISLAND.
