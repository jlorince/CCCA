WITHIN WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN
EXPERT.
TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO
TRUE CRIME.
I WILL ASK HIM WHO HAS GOT
THE RECORD FOR HEADS BATTED
IN.
PLEASE WELCOME BILL JAMES.
HEY, MR. JAMES.
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING.
>> ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU WERE
FAMOUS FOR IN THE '70s AND
'80s YOU REVOLUTIONIZED
BASEBALL STATISTICS BY
APPLYING YOUR OWN, YOUR OWN
METH, YOUR OWN ANALYSIS.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
>> I-- DID A LOT OF STUPID
STUFF WZ.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS WATT
STUPID STUFF YOU CUT OUT,
SERB ASPECT APPROXIMATES OF
ANALYSIS.
>> I STARTED COUNTING A LOT
OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE HADN'T
THOUGHT TO COUNT BEFORE.
THAT WAS ONE THING.
AND I CONSISTENTLY ASKED THE
QUESTION, WHICH HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE BOOK I'M HERE
FOR.
>> Stephen: I CONSISTENTLY
ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT IS
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS TO
THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE
ARE DEBATING.
>> Stephen: AND IT TURNS OUT
THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN WHAT THEY WERE
SAYING AND WHAT THEY WANTED
TO SAY.
>> VERY OFTEN, YES.
>> Stephen: SO YOU BLEW
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER.
>> YOU BLEW EVERYBODY OUT OF
THE WATER WITH THAT.
NOW YOU HAVE GOT A NEW LOVE
YOU'RE SHARING WITH PEOPLE.
IT'S AN OLD LOVE OF YOURS
BUT NEW TO US.
IT'S CALLED POPULAR CRIME.
REFLECTIONS ON THE
CELEBRATION OF VIOLENCE.
NOW YOU KNOW, YOU USED TO BE
KNOWN FOR FOLLOWING SPORTS.
NOW IT'S VIOLENT CRIME.
WHY NOT JUST FOLLOW FOOTBALL
AND KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE
STONE?
>> HOW MANY BIRDS COULD YOU
KILL WITH WAY BASEBALL BAT.
>> Stephen: WOW, HOW MANY,
YOU'RE THE EXPERT.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT A LOT
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED
WITH BASEBALL BATS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YES WZ WHONS'S THE BABE
RUTH OF BASHING HEADS IN?
>> I FORGOT TO DO RESEARCH
ON THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WOULD
YOU ASK.
>> Stephen: WHAT, WHY THE
LOVE OF POPULAR CRIME?
YOU'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED --
>> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
INTERESTED IN THEM.
CRIME STORIES ARE KEYS TO
WHAT PEOPLE GOES ON INSIDE
YOUR HEAD THAT YOU DON'T
ORDINARILY TALK ABOUT.
CRIME STORIES ARE ONE OF THE
MOST INTERESTING THINGS IN
THE NEWSPAPER OR ON THE
INTERNET BECAUSE THEY TELL
YOU THINGS ABOUT WHAT IS
GOING ON IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.
THEY MAKE DETAILS OF
PEOPLE'S LIVES TREMENDOUSLY
IMPORTANT AND FOCUS
ATTENTION ON THEM IN A WAY
THAT, AND IT EXPOSES THE
SIDE OF PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT
THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT
OTHERWISE.
AND-- JUST BECOMES VERY
INTERESTING.
>> Stephen: IS THERE
SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO
TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
>> IS THERE SOME SIDE OF
YOUR LIFE YOU'RE TRYING TO
TELL US ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
YOU CAN ADMIT ANYTHING.
NO ONE WILL PAY ATTENTION
BECAUSE OF BIN LADEN.
I AM A METH TWEAKER, YOU
KNOW THAT.
>> INDEED.
I HAVE HEARD RUMORS, YES.
>> Stephen: YES.
SO WHAT IS IT, YOU SAY THIS
IS AS SOMETHING ABOUT OUR
CULTURE THAT WE CELEBRATE
VIOLENCE SO MUCH THAT WE ARE
SO OBVIOUS-- OBSESSED WITH
THE LURID DETAILS OF CRIME.
>> PORE ABOUT HUMAN NATURE
THAN ABOUT OUR CULTURE.
ALL CULTURES ARE
OBVIOUSED-- OBSESSED WITH
CRIME STORIES.
THE BIBLE IS FULL OF CRIME
STORIES.
EVERY CULTURE AROUND THE
WORLD IS OBSESSED WITH CRIME
WHICH ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME
ACROSS TIME AND ACROSS CULL
DURES.
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN
WHERE THAT GIRL WENT.
AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE MORE FAMOUS
VIOLENT CRIMES IN AMERICA.
CAN YOU APPLY STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS TO VIOLENT CRIME
LIKE LIZZIE BORDEN.
LIZZIE BORDEN TOOK AN AXE,
GAVE HER FATHER 40 WHACKS
WHEN SHE SAW WHAT SHE HAD
DONE, SHE GAVE HER MOTHER
41.
WHAT IS HER WHACK AVERAGE.
>> YOU CAN APPLY STATISTICS
TO VIOLENT CRIME BUT IT
WOULD MAKE A VERY BORING
BOOK AND I DIDN'T DO IT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE
OPINIONS ABOUT WHETHER
PEOPLE ARE IN JAIL WHO ARE
INNOCENT?
LIKE WHAT ABOUT LIZZIE
BORDEN.
YOU THINK SHE DID IT.
>> NO, SHE DID NOT DO IT SHE
DID NOT-- .
>> Stephen: IT RHYMES.
>> IF IT RHYMES, YOU DID THE
CRIME.
THAT'S A LAW, I THINK.
>> IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE,
YES.
AND JOHNNY COCHRAN HAS
PASSED ON, YOU CAN APPLY TO
REPLACE HIM.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT SOME
OF THE BIG ONES GOING ON
RIGHT NOW.
LIKE AMANDA KNOX.
>> I DID NOT TALK ABOUT
AMANDA KNOX.
IT'S TOO RECENT.
I TRIED TO WRITE ABOUT CASES
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT
HAPPENED.
I MEAN, THE ONLY THING WE
KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT THE
AMANDA KNOX CASE IS THE
ITALIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A
TERRIBLE MESS.
OTHERWISE NOTHING IS REALLY
APPARENT AT THIS POINT.
>> Stephen: BUT SHE'S
CLEARLY INNOCENT.
>> I THINK SO.
>> Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE
SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.
>> WELL.
>> Stephen: ARE EVIL PEOPLE,
ARE MURDERS ATTRACTIVE
PEOPLE OR UGLY PEOPLE.
>> FOR THE MOST PART THEY
ARE UGLY PEOPLE.
NO, SERIOUS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
NESS SERIOUSLY.
>> Stephen: SO THAT EVIL IS
UGLY.
>> WELL, NO, BUT MOSTLY
PEOPLE NOT LIVING THE BEST
OF LIVES.
AND THEY HAVE HARD LIVES AND
THEY EXPRESS IT BY-- .
>> Stephen: CHOPPING PEOPLE
UP.
>> YEAH, OCCASIONALLY.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A
FAVORITE MURDERER?
>> LET'S SEE, THE, THE ONLY
MURDER FOR WHOM I HAVE
SYMPATHY WAS WINNIE JUDD IN
1932 BECAUSE SHE LIVED TO BE
A NICE SWEET OLD LADY AND
KIND OF OUTGREW IT.
>> Stephen: IT WAS A PHASE.
>> RIGHT.
A PHASE SHE WAS GOING
THROUGH.
>> Stephen: ARE THERE GREAT
UNSOLVED MURDER CASES IN
AMERICAN HISTORY RIGHT NOW.
>> ONE OF THE THINS THAT
MAKES A CRIME ENDURINGLY
FASCINATING IS THAT WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
IN A CASE, THE CASE TENDS TO
LOSE INTEREST.
THE PURSUIT OF TRYING TO
FIGURE, PUT THIS ALL
TOGETHER THAT MAKES A CASE
FASCINATING.
>> Stephen: BASEBALL HAS A
STATISTICS THAT MAKES THINGS
CHECKABLE.
IS THERE A LIKE IN CRIME,
WHAT IS THE ONUS WAGNER CARD
OF MURDER.
>> I'M SURE PROBABLY ONE OF
JOHN WAYNE DAYSY'S PAINTING.
I DON'T HAVE ANY.
>> Stephen: THEY DID SELL.
>> THEY DID SELL.
>> Stephen: EVEN AS A CHILD
DID YOU ENJOY CRIME STORIES.
>> WHEN EVEN WHEN I WAS A
SMALL KID, YES.
>> Stephen: AND DID THIS
ALARM ANYONE?
>> STATE SERVICES WASN'T AS
ROBUST THEN AS THEY ARE NOW.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
