WHY WAS I SO DEEPLY MOVED BY IT?
BECAUSE, WHILE THE MOVIE ISBEAUTIFUL, I THINK-- WHEN I
WATCH A WES ANDERSON MOVIE, THEEMOTIONAL MOMENTS -- THE MOMENTS

HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A MOVIETHAT WORKS, THAT DOES SOMETHING
TO YOU MYSTERIOUSLY.
ALTHOUGH, HE'S DEVOTED HIS LIFETO CRAFT AND TO PASSION AND TO
MAKING THESE-- TELLING THESESTORIES.
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEYOND ME ANDMY UNDERSTANDING, BUT I FEEL THE
SAME WAY THAT IT'S VERYEFFECTIVE.
THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT-- ISN'T THISWHAT IT'S ABOUT?
IT'S ABOUT--( LAUGHTER )
IT'S ABOUT THE TELLING OF ASTORY BY A WONDERFUL
STORYTELLER, REMEMBERING A GREATSOUL WHO IS THE EMBODIMENT OF
LOVE, AND YOU LEAVE THE THEATERFILLED WITH A KIND OF UNUSUAL
ECSTASY AND ENLIGHTENMENT.
SO-CALLED.
ISN'T THAT TRUE?
>> Stephen:  I DIDN'T FOLLOW ALOT OF THAT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I THOUGHT IT WAS-- I THOUGHT ITWAS FUNNY.
>> IT'S HILARIOUS.
>> Stephen:  I THOUGHT IT WASFUNNY.
>> IT'S HILARIOUS.
>> Stephen:  IT REALLY IS.
THE WHOLE MOVIE IS-- AND YOU CANSAY THIS ABOUT A LOT OF HIS
MOVIES -- IT'S A CONFECTION.
THE HOTEL LOOKS LIKE A "CAKEBOSS" CAKE.

TELEVISION, NEXT TO MINE,REALLY.
WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR VALUES.
IT'S LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW, SORTOF-- THIS CONFECTION OF A HOTEL,
ALMOST LIKE IT'S MADE OUT OFFROSTING IN SOME WAYS.
IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT CAKE FOR AGAY WEDDING, IS WHAT IT WOULD
DO.
>> IT CERTAINLY WOULD.
>> Stephen:  THE STORY ITSELFIS SOMETHING OF A CONFECTION,
BUT WHEN YOU CUT INTO IT,THERE'S MEAT THERE.
IT'S A MEAT CAKE.

WELL PUT, WELL PUT.
TRUE ENOUGH.

THINGS AND TO WORK ON THESEMOVIES IT'S BEAUTIFULLY
DESIGNED.
>> Stephen:  HOW DO YOU GETINVITED?
HOW DO YOU GET INVITED TO DO IT?
DOES AN ANCIENT INDIAN MAN SHOWUP ON A HUFFY BICYCLE WEARING A
VERY TINY SUIT AND HAND YOU ACALLIGRAPHYED INVITATION, THAT
SEES, "PLEASE TIP THIS MAN, HETHINKS HE IS A CHILD.
DO NOT DESTROY HIS ILLUSIONS."
>> YOU JUST MADE THAT UP.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FROM?
YES-- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
>> Stephen:  I'VE READ HISNEXT SCRIPT.
>> FANTASTIC.
YES, I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN,BUT THE GENERAL POETIC
IMPRESSION IS CORRECT.
IT'S LIKE COSMIC TRANSCENDENTALINVITATION TO TAKE AN ACID TRIP
OF SOME KIND.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW WHATAN ACID TRIP IS.
IS THAT LIKE DRINKING THESLURPEE TOO FAST?
>> SOME PEOPLE DON'T GET A BRAINFREEZE.

PARTICULAR, FINISHED, BEAUTIFULFILM, BUT HE WANTS TO MAKE THE
SHOOTING AN ART PROJECT INITSELF.
