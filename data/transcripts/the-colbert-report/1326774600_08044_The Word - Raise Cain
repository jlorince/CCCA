>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, ARE YOU GOING SPOIL
ME, FOLKS.
MY EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE FOR
A POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDACY IN SOUTH CAROLINA
IS ON THE GLIDE RAIL TO
GLORY.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
KEEPING US FROM GRABBING
THAT GREASED PIG OF VICTORY,
JIM.
>> THERE IS NO WAY FOR
COLBERT TO GET ON THE BALLOT
RIGHT NOW.
THEY GO NOT ALLOW WRITE INS
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> YOU CAN'T GET ON THE
BALLOT THERE IS NO WRITE-IN
SPACE.
HE CAN'T EVEN RUN.
>> FORTUNATELY FOR STEPHEN
COLBERT THIS WILL BE TOUGH.
GUESS WHAT, SOUTH CAROLINA
DOESN'T HAVE A PROVISION IN
THE PRIMARIES FOR PRESIDENT
TO BE A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THEY'RE
KEEPING ME OFF THE BALLOT,
ON THE TECHNICALITY-- INDEED.
THEY'RE KEEPING ME OFF ON
THE TECHNICALITY THAT I'M
TWO AND A HALF MONTHS LATE
TO FILE.
FINE, SPLIT HAIRS.
BUT NO WRITE-INS?
THAT'S ANTI-FREEDOM.
AS AN AMERICAN I BELIEVE WE
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT
ANYONE'S NAME WE WANT, EVEN
IF THAT PERSON IS A COMPLETE
WASTE OF YOUR VOTE.
SLEEPY, DOPEY, PERRY, YOU
NAME IT.
(APPLAUSE)
BUT FOLKS, BEING ABLE TO
WRITE IN WHOEVER YOU WANT
THAT'S JUST FREEDOM.
AND DRAWING UP IN
SOUTH-- GROWING NEWSPAPER
SOUTH CAROLINA I WAS TAUGHT
THAT FREEDOM WAS WHY WE
STARTED THE CIVIL WAR.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE, YOU
PLAY YOUR GAME.
I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE
BALLOT ANYWAY.
I'M JUST EXFLOOR-- EXPLORING
HOW MUCH HUNGER THERE IS OUT
THERE FOR A POTENTIAL
STEPHEN COLBERT CAMPAIGN.
THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU
GAUGE IF PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE
FOR YOU IN A STATE WHERE
YOUR NAME IS NOT ON THE
BALLOT?
THAT'S A PICKLE, FOLKS.
AND IT BRINGS US TO
TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RAISE CAIN.
NOW FOLKS, THE BALLOT IN
SOUTH CAROLINA IS LOCKED.
THAT MEANS I CAN'T GET ON.
BUT BEING LOCKED ALSO MEANS
THAT FORMER CANDIDATE HERMAN
CAIN CAN'T GET OFF.
AND FOLKS, I HAVE NEVER,
EVER, I HAVE NEVER MADE A
SECRET OF MY ADMIRATION FOR
MY MAIN MAN HERRMANN.
>> THE COLE BERTS SUPERPAC
OFFICIALLY ENDORSES HERMAN
CAIN FOR PRESIDENT.
WHOOO!
GET ON THE HERMAN CAIN
TRAIN.
I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT RHYMES.
AND IT'S MUCH CATCHIER THAN
STEP ON INTO THE RON PAUL
SHOWER STALL.
CAIN UNDERSTANDS DOMESTIC
ISSUES BECAUSE HE HAD
SPECIOUS SELLING PIZZA.
AND HE UNDERSTANDS
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES BECAUSE
PIZZA IS ITALIAN.
NOW FOLKS I SHARE SO MANY OF
CAIN'S VALUES.
I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER OF
BOTH OPPORTUNITY ZONES AND
PIZZA.
NOW BECAUSE CAIN AND RI SO
SIMILAR, I THINK THAT IF
THIS SATURDAY HERMAN CAIN
WERE TO GET A SIGNIFICANT
NUMBER OF VOTES, THAT WOULD
BE A SIGN THAT VOTERS ARE
HUNGRY.
HUNGRY, HUNGRY FOR A STEPHEN
COLBERT CAMPAIGN.
NOW LIKE CAIN I'M AN
OUTSIDER.
AND I KNOW MY APPEAL IS
BROADER THAN JUST THE
REPUBLICANS.
LUCKILY SOUTH CAROLINA HAS
ALWAYS WELCOMED OUTSIDERS.
YOU SEE, THE THING IS-- MY
HOME STATE, MY HOME STATE
HAS WHAT'S CALLED AN OPEN
PRIMARY.
WHICH MEANS TO VOTE, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO BE A
REPUBLICAN.
ANYBODY WHO SHARES MY VALUES
CAN SHOW IT BY VOTING FOR
HERMAN CAIN.
THAT'S A WIN-WIN.
THAT MEANS-- THAT MEANS
INDEPENDENCE, DEMOCRATS,
COLLEGE KIDS, VIEWERS OF MY
SHOW, PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED MY
RALLY, MY TWITTER FOLLOWERS,
MY GOOD FRIENDS ON READ IT,
YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE INTERNET,
STAND UP AND SHOUT.
BECAUSE YOU SEE, YOU ARE ALL
LEGALLY ELIGIBLE TO GO DOWN
TO THE POLLS AND TELL THE
WORLD HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
HERMAN CAIN.
BECAUSE, FOLKS IF OUR
MESSAGE IS GOING TO BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST
RAISE MONEY AND RAISE
AWARENESS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE
CAIN.
