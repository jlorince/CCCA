>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
MacARTHUR GENIUS GRANT
RECIPIENT WHO LIVED FOR
THREE YEARS IN INDIA SLUMS.
HUH, YOU THINK A GENIUS
COULD HAVE FOUND A NICE
HOTEL.
PLEASE WELCOME KATHERINE
BOO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MISS BOO, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE AN AMERICAN.
YOU WRITE FOR "THE NEW
YORKER", YOU USED TO WRIT
FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST".
ARE YOU THE RECIPIENT OF THE
PULITZER PRAISE AND A
MacARTHUR GENIUS GRANT, LA
DI DA, OKAY.
GENIUS GRANT PERSON, WHAT
NUMBER AM I THINKING OF?
>> 86, YOU CAN BUY THAT
[BLEEP].
>> REALLY?
>> UNDER THE TABLE MONEY.
>> YOU CAN BUY GENIUS GRANT.
>> UH-HUH, YEAH.
>> I HAVE TO GET ME ONE.
ARE YOU ALSO THE AUTHOR OF A
NEW BOOK, BEHIND THE
BEAUTIFUL FOREVERS.
LIFE, DEATH AND HOPE IN A
MUMBAI UNDERCITY.
WHAT IS AN UNDERCITY.
>> IT IS A PLACE THAT IS
INCREASINGLY HARD TO SEE
THESE DAYS, LOW INCOME
COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE, LIKE
THE SLUMS IN MUMBAI, LAKE
MANY NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR
COUNTRY.
>> WHY CAN'T WE SEE THEM.
>> BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A
GATED COMMUNITY.
>> I AM IN MY GATED
COMMUNITY.
>> YOU HAVE YOUR TINTED
WINDOWS.
>> RIGHT AND I HAVE
SUNGLASSES THAT HAVE MIRRORS
ON THE INSIDE.
I SAW SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE,
OKAY S THAT WHAT THIS IS, IS
THIS SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.
>> EXACTLY THERE IS NO SONG
AND DANCE THOUGH AT THE END.
>> THERE IS NO SONG AND
DANCE AT THE END.
>> NO SONG AND DANCE, NO.
ONLY TROUBLE IS THAT THESE
ARE REAL PEOPLE, LIKE ACTUAL
PEOPLE SO, WHEN ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO
GETS BEATEN UP BY THE POLICE
OR SOMEBODY WHO GATHERS
GARBAGE FOR A LIVING, THOSE
ARE REAL PEOPLE, THEY DON'T
GET TO GO TO THE OSCARS
AFTERWARDS.
>> AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
IN THE UNDERCITY THAT YOU
SPENT THREE YEARS GOING TO.
>> THIS ONE IS ON LAND OWNED
BY THE MUMBAI INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT.
AND SO THERE ARE ABOUT
80,000, 90,000 FAMILIES
LIVER ON THIS LAND.
AND IF YOU TAKE A PLACE LIKE
LIKE-- ONLY SIX PEOPLE OUT
36,000 HAVE PERMANENT WORK.
>> WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF
POVERTY WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT.
YOU TALK ABOUT ONE YOUNG MAN
NAMED ABDUL WHO LIVES IN A
SHED FILLED WITH GARBAGE HE
COLLECTED AND HE IS FLIPPING
GARBAGE TRAYING TO MAKE
MONEY OFF OF IT.
>> UH-HUH.
>> IS THAT PERSON POOR BY
INDIAN STANDARDS.
>> NO, IN THIS SLUM, THIS
KIDS IS A KID WITHOUT HONOR
IN EVEN IN HIS OWN FAMILY,
HIS BROTHER IS SMARTER AND
COOLER.
BUT HE'S MANAGED TO SUPPORT
A FAMILY OF 11 BUYING AND
SELLING THE THINGS THAT RICH
PEOPLE THROW AWAY.
AND SO HE HAS GOT, WHEN THE
STORY BEGINS HE HAS PROSPECT
ITS BETTER THAN ALMOST
ANYBODY IN THE SLUM.
>> WHAT IS THE STANDARD OF
POVERTY IN INDIA IF THAT
PERSON ISN'T POOR.
>> IT'S LIKE THE IRAQ WAR.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REDEFINE
WHAT WINNING IS OR REDEFINE
WHAT POVERTY IS, NOBODY'S
REALLY POOR.
>> WHY DON'T WE DO THAT
HERE.
WHEN YOU GO THERE AND SPEND
THREE YEARS LIVING WITH
PEOPLE WHO ARE BY OUR
STANDARDS ABJECTLY POOR.
>> UH-HUH.
>> WHAT DOES AMERICA LOOK
LIKE YOU TO WHEN YOU COME
BACK.
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS
INCREDIBLY FIXABLE.
ALSO YOU TURN ON THE TAP, OH
PIE GOD, POTABLE WATER,
THAT'S AMAZING.
YEAH, I COME BACK HEAR AND I
THINK OH F WE WERE REALLY
SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING POVERTY
WE COULD DO IT LIKE HALF A
SECOND.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
IF IT'S FIXABLE, HOW DO WE
FIX IT.
OBVIOUSLY --
>> CUT THE TAXES OF THE
RICH.
>> KPABDLY.
>> I WILL SUGGEST THAT.
>> BECAUSE THAT TRICKLES
DOWN HERE.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I AM
TRYING TO SEE BY SPENDING
THE TLAE YEARS, EXACTLY WHAT
DOES TRICKLE DOWN.
>> DOES ANYTHING TRICKLE
DOWN.
>> IT IS A SOCIETY IN WHICH
CORRUPTION TAKES SO MUCH
OPPORTUNITY FROM THE POOR
THAT CORRUPTION ITSELF
BECOMES ONE OF THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT REMAIN.
>> IF THERE WAS SOME ADVICE
YOU COULD GIVE AMERICAN
POLITICIANS, BASED UPON WHAT
YOU SEE AS THE FAILURES OF
THE INDIAN POLITICIANS OR DO
YOU THINK THIS COUNTRY IS
BEING GOVERNED WELL.
>> I THINK IT IS THE SAME
THING IN DELI AS IT IS IN
WASHINGTON.
THERE IS SO MUCH ENERGY
EXPENDED ON, YOU KNOW,
THINKING UP THE NEXT NEW
IDEA FOR FIXING POVERTY BUT
THERE IS VERY LITTLE
ATTENTION TO SAY, TO WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THAT
MONEY GETS TO THE POOR
PEOPLE ON THE STREET.
>> I MEAN, ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY, THE ONLY REASON
I WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE
POOR PEOPLE MONEY IS SO I
DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
THEM ANY MORE.
AND THAT'S A DOLLAR WELL
SPENT.
BECAUSE IF I THINK ABOUT
THEM TOO MUCH I MIGHT WANT
TO GIVE THEM EVEN MORE
MONEY.
>> WE WOULDN'T WANT TO YOU
HAVE COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE.
>> NO I CAN'T GET COMPASSION
FAT AGENCY BECAUSE THEN I
WILL BE FAT AGENCIED.
--
>> DO JOURNALISTS HAVE A
FORM OF MISSIONARY WORK.
I MEAN IS THIS-- THIS MUST
HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY HARD,
TACKING WORK TO DO.
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN EASIER
WORK FOR TO YOU DO.
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A FOOD
WRITER FOR A FEW YEARS.
>> YEAH.
I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, I
THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY
COOL WORK TO DO BECAUSE I
GET TO SPEND MY DAYS WITH
PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING
INTERESTING THINGS AND WHO
ARE, I FIND TO BE INSPIRING
ON SO MANY LEVELS.
SO I ACTUALLY FIND THAT IT
IS A REASONABLE WAY TO MAKE
A LIVING.
>> WAS IT HARD.
>> SURE IT WAS HARD.
>> WHY WORK AT SOMETHING
HARD.
I WORK HALF AN HOUR A NIGHT.
KATHERINE BOO, THANK SO MUCH
NOR JOINING ME.
KATHERINE BOO, THE BOOK IS
BEHIND THE BEAUTIFUL
FOREVERS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
