DESK WITH A BAG OF POTTING
SOIL.
JOINING ME NOW IS ONE OF THE
MANY VICTIMS OF INTERNET
PIRACY.
A MUNICH MANAGER WHOSE
CLIENTS HAVE INCLUDED
NIRVANA AND THE BEASTIE BOYS,
PLEASE WELCOME FORMER HEAD
OF MERCURY RECORDS AND
PRESIDENT OF-- ENTERTAINMENT,
DANNY GOLDBERG, THANKS SO
MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)
THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM,
ISN'T IT.
>> I THINK THE INTERNET IS
GREAT.
I LOVE IT.
BUT OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS,
THERE ARE
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CREATED
AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE
ARE THOUSANDS OF JOBS LOST
AND MOVIES AND RECORDS AND
BOOKS.
AND THE PENDULUM NEEDS TO
SWING BACK TO ITS MIDDLE.
>> Stephen: SHOULDN'T THE
FREE MARKET HANDLE THIS.
WHEN MY SHOW STARTED I WAS
ABOUT 25% OF ALL THE VIDEOS
ON YOUTUBE, ALL RIGHT.
[BLEEP] YOU NOT, NOW MY
PARENT COMPANY VIACOM
BROUGHT A BILLION DOLLAR
HAMMER DOWN ON GOOGLE THAT
OWNED YOUTUBE.
ISN'T THAT HOW IT SHOULD BE
WORKED OUT, BY COMPANIES
POLICING THEMSELVES?
>> WELL, LAWSUITS ARE PART
OF THE LAW.
AND LAWS, A NEW LAW ALLOWS
PEOPLE TO SUE FOR THINGS
LIKE THAT.
BUT POLICEMAN ARREST PEOPLE
FOR STEALING.
AND YOU NEED COPS TO
ENFORCE-- TO ENFORCE THE
LAW.
>> Stephen: CAN WE GET
INTERNET POLICEMAN, MAYBE
THOSE GUYS FROM TRON ON
MOTORCYCLES.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON A SECOND.
NOW JOINING US NOW TO DEFEND
THIEVES AND PIRATES, PLEASE
WELCOME PROFESSOR OF
INTERNET LAW AT HARVARD,
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHY, WHY DO YOU WANT ARTISTS
TO STARVE?
>> I WANT ARTISTS TO THRIVE.
THE INTERNET ALLOWS ARTISTS
TO FIND THEIR AUDIENCES.
WHEN JUSTICE -- JUSTIN
BEIBER STARTED JUST SING HIS
FAVORITE SONGING ON YOUTUBE
HE GOT DISCOVERED THANKS TO
THE INTERNET.
AND THE ODD THING IS, UNDER
THIS LAW, THE BEHAVIOR OF
JUST FIN BEIBER, SINGING HIS
FAVORITE SONGS WITHOUT
AUTHORIZATION OVER THE
INTERNET COULD MAKE HIM A
FELL ON IN JAIL FOR THREE
YEARS, SO.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE
SAYING YOU DO NOT
WANT-- EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
CLAP AFTER I NAIL HIM.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DO NOT
WANT TO SEE JUSTIN BOOEB
NEVER JAIL?
>> NOT-- I'M NOT SAYING-- .
>> Stephen: WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THAT POINTS.
WHAT ABOUT THE POINT THAT IF
PEOPLE GET PROSECUTED F
THERE ARE CRIMINAL PENALTIES
FOR POSTING COPY WRITTEN
MATERIAL, PEOPLE WILL GO TO
JAIL, THAT WILL STIFLE ART.
>> OH THAT'S JUST AN
EXAGGERATION.
THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS LAW IS
ABOUT, AS I UNDERSTAND IT
THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THESE COMPANIES
OVERSEAS THAT HAVE BEEN
STEALING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
WORTH OF THINGS AND SELLING
ADVERTISING BASED ON IT
CAN'T DO IT.
NOBODY WANTS TO PUT JUSTIN
BOOEB NEVER JAIL.
>> Stephen: KNOCK, SOME
PEOPLE WANT TO PUT JUSTIN
BOOEB NEVER JAIL.
>> NOT ME, I LOVE JUSTIN
BEIBER.
>> Stephen: NOW WHAT ABOUT
THAT DANNY OVER HERE SAYS
THIS IS JUST FOR FOREIGN
COMPANIES THAT ARE STEALING
FROM OUR ARTISTS.
>> THIS IS A 78 PAGE LAW,
SOME OF THEM ARE ABOUT
PUTTING JUSTIN BIEBER IN
JAIL, BUT THERE ARE OTHER
PARTS OF THE LAW THAT SAY IF
THERE ARE SITES OVERSEAS
THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
DOESN'T LIKE, THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL WITHOUT ANY OTHER
ADVERSARIAL PROCEEDING CAN
GET AN ORDER ASKING AMERICAN
INTERNET COMPANIES TO CUT
OFF THAT SITE.
AND IN ESSENCE THIS LAW
TAKES A PAGE OUT OF THE
PLAYBOOKS OF CHINA AND IRAN
FOR INTERNET REGULATION.
AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE
WANT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT IRAN BUT CHINA IS KICK
OUR ASS IN BUSINESS RIGHT
NOW.
WOULDN'T THIS BE GOOD FOR
AMERICAN BUSINESS BECAUSE IF
WE SHUT DOWN PARTS OF THE
INTERNET WON'T PEOPLE AT
WORK ACTUALLY DOT WORK THEY
WERE HIRED FOR.
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY
ARE STILL GOING PLAY
SOLITAIRE.
SO THEY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO
FIND A WAY.
>> Stephen: WE'LL COME UP
WITH A LAW TO SHUT DOWN
SOLITAIRE.
OKAY.
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS LAW
GOES FAR ENOUGH.
>> YOU NEED SOMETHING TO
PREVENT STEALING.
THE PENDULUM IS GOING TOO
FAR.
YOU KNOW, APPLE HAS A
LEGITIMATE WAY OF SELLING
MUSIC.
THEY NEGOTIATE WITH THE
COMPANIES AND THEY SELL IT
AND iPODS ARE DOING GREAT
AND iTUNES IS DOING GREAT
AND EVERYONE GETS PAID FOR.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF THERE
WAS SOME EVEN TRADE-OFF
BETWEEN THEFT AND
RETRIBUTION LIKE THE ARTIST
ACTUALLY GOT TO GET
SOMETHING OUT OF THE
INTERNET COMPANY THAT WAS
STEALING FROM THEM, LIKES AN
EYE FOR AN iPOD.
>> WELL, IT'S A GOOD LINE
BUT-- .
>> Stephen: IT'S AN
EXCELLENT LINE.
AND IF ANYONE STEALS IT-- IS
A COPY WRITTEN LINE AND IF
YOU STEAL IT I WILL SUE.
DANNY GOLD FWERING, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
