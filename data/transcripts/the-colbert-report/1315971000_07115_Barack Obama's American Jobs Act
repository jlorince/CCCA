TOUCH OF DEATH TO ANY CAMPAIGN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT, FOR THE
NEXT 14 MONTHS, BARACK OBAMA IS
STILL THE PRESIDENT.
LIKE LAST WEEK HE RUBBED IN THE
OUR FACE BY CALLING A JOINT
SESSION OF CONGRESS TO UNVEIL
HIS NEW $447 BILLION AMERICAN
JOBS ACT.
ON FRIDAY, HE HELD RALLIES TO
PROMOTE THE BILL.
YESTERDAY HE WAS IN THE WHITE
HOUSE ROSE GARDEN TO ANNOUNCE
THAT HE WAS SENDING THE BILL TO
CONGRESS AND TOMORROW HE'S GOING
TO APPEAR LIVE FROM THE OVAL
OFFICE CALLING FEDEX WITH A
TRACKING CODE TO FIND OUT IF
ANYONE IN CONGRESS WOULD SIGN
FOR IT.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
BUT FOLKS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY
SHOULD BECAUSE LAST NIGHT/TELL
YOU I SAT DOWN TO READ THIS
199-PAGE BOONDOGGLE BUT LUCKILY
THE T.V. WAS ON.
JIM?
>> THIS TIME LAST NIGHT,
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS UNVEILING
HIS NEW JOBS PLAN.
MORE THAN HALF OF THAT IS TAX
CUTS PLUS NEW SPENDING ON
SCHOOLS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, TAX CUTS I
UNDERSTAND.
BUT WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT
BUILDING BRIDGES AND ROADS!
THAT WAS PROVEN BY REAGAN'S
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION, BO
DUKE.
HE DID NOT USE PAVED ROADS AND
HE SURE AS HELL DID NOT NEED
BRIDGES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OBAMA'S PLAN IS JUST MORE
JOB-KILLING SPENDING ADDING TO
OUR JOB-KILLING DEBT.
OBAMA CAN CREATE SOME
JOB-KILLINGS JOBS, RIGHT, PEOPLE
WHE WANT HIS JOB?
>> THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR AMERICA
IS NOT TO GROW GOVERNMENT OR TO
BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT CAN
CREATE JOBS.
>> THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES YOU
CREATE JOBS THROUGH THE
GOVERNMENT.
>> DON'T WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT TO
CREATE JOBS FOR US.
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO MESS IT
UP.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD A PERSON
WHO CAN'T FEED HIS FAMILY WANT
ONE OF THOSE MESSED-UP
GOVERNMENT JOBS WHERE THEY PAY
YOU THIS THIS WORTHLESS
GOVERNMENT SCRIPT THEY PRINT
THEMSELVES ON PAPER!
