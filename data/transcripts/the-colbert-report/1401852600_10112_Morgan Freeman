LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RETALKING ABOUT.
>> SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR IS IN THEEYE OF THE BEHOLDER.
MOST OF THE SUPER RICH WOULDARGUE THEY'RE NOT BREAKING ANY
SOCIAL RULES.
IN FACT, THEIR INVESTMENTSCREATE JOBS AND MAKE THE ENTIRE
ECONOMY THRIVE AND GROW.
BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLEAT ANY INCOME LEVEL WHO ARE
WILLING TO CHEAT TO MAKE APROFIT.
WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED OUTBY NAME IN FRONT OF A CROWD,
SHAME CAN BE EFFECTIVE.
>> OKAY, IS THAT AN ATTACK ONRICH PEOPLE?
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
YOU ARE A RICH MAN.
>> NO, IT IS NOT AN ATTACK ONRICH PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT IT IS -- LET'S CALL IT ANEXAMINATION OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF LEVELING THE FIELD A LITTLEBIT MORE.
>> Stephen: THE EPISODE ISEVERY SHOW STARTS WITH A
QUESTION.
THIS ONE IS POVERTY GENETIC?
WHO WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION?
I MEAN, YOU WOULD ASK THATQUESTION.
>> I WOULD ASK IT, YEAH.
>> Stephen: IS IT GENETIC?
NO, CAN'T POSSIBLY BE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A VERYSHORT SHOW.
>> IT'S A VERY SHORT SHOW.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHOARE EXAMINING THE IDEA OF
GENETICS INVOLVED WITH WEALTH.
>> Stephen: AS A STAR OF STAGEAND SCREEN --
>> AND RADIO.
>> Stephen: -- AND RADIO, ISTHERE A FIELD YOU HAVEN'T
CONQUERED YET THAT YOU'D LIKETO?
>> NO...
>> Stephen: NO?
NO...
I THINK I'M PRETTY COMPLETE BYNOW.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE COMPLETE?
YEAH(LAUGHTER)
I'M ALMOST AT THE APEX OF LIFE.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES THATFEEL?
