(APPLAUSE) NATION, MY MAMA TAUGHT ME IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY
DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.
THAT WAY YOU CAN HEAR ALL THE NOT-NICE THINGS I HAVE TO SAY.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT WAG OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN THEN I GO
STRAIGHT TO CONFESSION TO RECEIVE FORGIVENESS FOR THE SIN OF PRIDE.
LIKE I SAID, I TAMM BEST AT IT.
AND AS A CHRISTIAN I CONSTANTLY NEED REMINDERS OF MY FAITH SO I NEVER FORGET THE SACRIFICES
JESUS MADE OVER THERE IN...
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHERE IT'S HOT AND PEOPLE WEAR SANDALS.
BURNING BUSH, TALKING SNAKE-ISTAN, WHATEVER.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I SAW THIS:
>> IF YOU WERE LOOKING TO GET INTO GOD'S GOOD GRACES OR IN THE
MARKET FOR A FAMILY-FRIENDLY TABLET YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK OUT FAMILIES CHRISTIANS EDIFY.
>> BILLED AS THE WORLD'S FIRST CHRISTIAN TABLET IT COMES PRE-LOAD TO BIBLE AND ADS THAT
LINK TO CHRISTIAN RADIO STATIONS.
IT FEATURES A BROWSE WE ARE A SAFE SEARCH THAT PREVENTS IT FROM ACCESSING ANY X-RATED MATERIAL.
>> Stephen: AND NO FINGERING THE TOUCH SCREEN UNTIL YOU'VE MARRIED IT.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THE EDIFY'S GOT IT ALL, A BROWSER, APPS, GAMES, I CAN'T
WAIT TO PLAY THEIR VERSION OF ANGRY BIRDS.
INSTEAD OF KNOCKING OVER HOUSES,
THE BIRDS ASK TO COME INSIDE AND TALK TO THE PIGS ABOUT JESUS.
(LAUGHTER) SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO THE FAMILY CHRISTIANS THE EDIFY TABLET.
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE CHRISTIANS HAD OUR OWN TECHNOLOGY.
WE ALREADY HAVE SPECIAL CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS, CHRISTIAN CABLE NETWORKS, CHRISTIAN CAMPS
AND CHRISTIAN DATING SIGHT SITES NOW WE HAVE A CHRISTIAN WAY TO IGNORE OUR FAMILIES WITH
MINDLESS PROCRASTINATION.
(LAUGHTER) SADLY, FOLKS, THERE ARE STILL SOME THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT
DON'T BROADCAST MY FACE TO THE WORLD.
FOR INSTANCE, I WANT CHRISTIAN ELECTRICITY, NOT THE DEVIL'S LIGHTNING FROM THAT FREAKY
THREE-PRONGED SOCKET IN THE WALL WHO WILL LET ANYBODY PLUG INTO IT.
ALTERNATING CURRENT?
NO THANKS, I DON'T WANT AC/DC, I WANT ONLY J.C.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NEXT UP, A WAG OF MY... THANK YOU.
PEOPLE ARE APPLAUDING JESUS.
(LAUGHTER) NEXT A WAG OF MY FINGER AT THE JAPANESE SCIENTIST WHO INVENTED
A ROCK PAPER SCISSORS PLAYING ROBOT THAT NEVER LOSES.
EVEN MORE SHOCKING, JAPANESE SCIENTISTS BUILT A ROBOT AND DIDN'T TRY TO HAVE SEX WITH IT
(LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY THIS ROCK PAPER CYBORG WINS BY CHEATING.
USED AS AN ULTRA HIGH SPEED CAMERA TO MAKE ITS MOVE ONE MILLISECOND AFTER ITS OW HUMAN
OPPONENT HAS MADE HIS.
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING AT THE SAME TIME SO IT ALWAYS WINS AND THEREFORE I ASSUME ALWAYS
GETS TO RIDE SHOTGUN.
(LAUGHTER) JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MECHANICAL MENACE IN ACTION WOW,
ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF REGULAR ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS COMBINED WITH BEING ALONE.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE IMPLICATIONS HERE ARE FRIGHTENING.
UP UNTIL NOW I HAVE NEVER LOST A GAME OF ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS WITH A MACHINE.
>> I PLAY EVERY MORNING AGAINST MY MR. COFFEE.
LOSER MAKES THE WINNER COFFEE.
BUT NOW... I LOST ONE.
BUT NOW THESE ROBOTS WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN THE MACHINES RISE UP AGAINST US MANKIND'S SOLE CHANCE OF
SURVIVAL IS TO BEAT THEM IN A WINNER-TAKE-ALL GAME OF ROCK PAPER SCISSORS.
JUST WATCH THE END OF "THE TERMINATOR." HE'S THROWING PAPER!
SARAH CONNOR, THROW SCISSORS IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!
FOLKS, OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO DEFEAT THESE MACHINES BY CHALLENGING THEM TO A GAME OF
ROCK, PAPER, WHAT IS THIS THING YOU HUMANS CALL LOVE?
AT WHICH POINT THE ROBOT WILL EITHER SELF-DESTRUCT BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THE PUREST
OF HUMAN EMOTIONS OR START HAVING SEX WITH YOU WHICH, COME ON, IS WHAT ITS JAPANESE
CREATORS WANTED ALL ALONG.
(LAUGHTER)
