(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
BEFORE WE GO.
I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE ANDREW
BUNETA AND HIS WIFE JEN ON THE
BIRTH OF THEIR BABY MILA SOPHIA
ROSE BUNETA WHO I BELIEVE WAS
NAMED AFTER MOST OF THE GOLDEN
GIRLS.
(LAUGHTER)
EVERYONE HERE AT THE "REPORT" IS
SO EXCITED TO MEET LITTLE MILA.
UNLESS ANDREW PHOTO SHOPPED THE
BABY TO GET OUT OF WORK.
(LAUGHTER)
AS A GIFT TO THE PROUD PARENTS,
HOLD YOUR DAUGHTER UP TO THE
SCREEN SO I CAN SOOTHE HER TO
SLEEP WITH OUR CLOSING CREDITS
MUSIC.
GOOD NIGHT.
