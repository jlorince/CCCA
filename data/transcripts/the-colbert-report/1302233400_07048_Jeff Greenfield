>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A CBS
CORRESPONDENT WITH A NEW BOOK OF
ALTERNATE HISTORY.
I'LL ASK HIM WHICH DEMOCRAT HAS
A SHOT AT DEFEATING PRESIDENT
McCAIN.
PLEASE WELCOME JEFF GREENFIELD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: LET'S GET RIGHT TO
THE BOOK.
"THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED"
STUNNING ALTERING HISTORIES OF
AMERICAN POLITICS, J.F.K.,çó
qREAGAN N.R.F.K., CARTER,
AN ALTERNATE AMERICAN HISTORY, I
READ YOUR BOOK AND I LOVED IT.
OKAY.
TELL ME WHAT I ENJOYED ABOUT IT.
WHAT IS AN ALTERNATE HISTORY OF
AMERICA?
>> IT TAKES EVENTS THAT ALMOST
HAPPENED, CAME REALLY CLOSE TO
HAPPENING, ANDS IS A OKAY IF WE
TURNED FATE THIS MUCH AND MAKE
THEM HAPPEN WATCH THE POLITICAL
CHANGES.
IN DECEMBER OF 1960 PRESIDENT
ELECT KENNEDY WAS SECONDS AWAY
FROM BEING KILLED BY A SUICIDE
BOMBER IN PALM BEACH, A MAN WITH
A CAR LOADED WITH DINE MIGHT.
>> Stephen: MUSLIM.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen: MANY MY ALTERNATE
HISTORY THAT'S THE CASE.
GO AHEAD.çó
>> UNDERSTOOD.
JACQUELINE KENNEDY CAME TO THE
DOOR.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO KILL HER IN
FRONT OF HIS WIFE AND THAT'S THE
ONLY REASON HE LIVED TO BE
PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: THERE'S ANOTHER
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT NOBODY
KNOWS ABOUT.
>> THE SECRET SERVICE CHIEF SAID
WE WERE SECONDS AWAY FROM LOSING
PRESIDENT KENNEDY.
IF THAT HAPPENS, WHICH I THINK
HAPPENED IN THIS BOOK YOU PUT
LYNDON JON AT THE CUBAN --
JOHNSON AT THE CUBAN MISSILE
CRISIS WITH DIFFERENT FEARS,
ADVISORS AND SENSE OF
SCEPTICISM.
THE OUTCOME OF THE CUBAN MISSILE
CRISIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?
HE WOULD HAVE SHOWED CASTRO HIS
APPENDIX SCAR.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY, AS A JOURNALIST, DO YOU --
WHY MAKE UP FICTIONAL AMERICAN
HISTORY?
GLENN BECK ALREADY DOES THAT,
YOU KNOW, EVERY NIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW, I RECENTLY LEARNED
WOOD
WOODROW WILSON -S WEREWOLF.
>> WE LEARNED ABOUT GREAT
LEADER, GEOGRAPHY, NATURAL
RESOURCES, FATE ON A FLIP OF A
COIN CAN PRODUCE POWERFUL
RESULTS.
THE MAN I WORKED FOR, ROBERT
KENNEDY.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE A
SPEECHWRITER FOR KEN.
>> Dick: THERE WAS ONLY A LAST
MINUTE ACCIDENTAL DECISION THAT
SENT HIM UNPROTECTED INTO THE
KITCHEN.
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW ALWAYS MADE
IT A POINT TO WALK IN FRONT OF
HIM NOT FOR SAFETY J TOWFT MAKE
IT EASIER.
HE HAPPENED TO BE IN A DIFFERENT
PLACE THAT NIGHT.
IF ROBERT KENNEDY LIVES, YOU
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
REAGAN SURVIVED THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.
MY FEELING IS THE 1968 CAMPAIGN
TAKES ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT
DIMENSION.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE PART AFTER
THIS PARTICULAR STORY.
I WORKED FOR ROBERT KENNEDY, IF
HE BECAME PRESIDENT, IN THIS
UNIVERSE, I HAVEN'T READ IT BUT
I'M GUESSING THAT PERHAPS THIS
SPEECHWRITER BACKS CHIEF OF
STAFF.
MARILYN MONROE IS IS A LIVE AND
YOU SPEND LATE EVENINGS TOGETHER
WHERE SHE SINGS HAPPY BIRTHDAY
MR. GREENFIELD.
DOES THAT HAPPEN TO YOU, JEFF?
>> I DON'T THINK I EXPLAINED TO
YOU THAT APPLAUSABILITY IS AN --
[ APPLAUSE
PLAUS ABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THE BOOK.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU CONCERNED
THAT SO FEW AMERICANS READ
HISTORY BOOKS THEY MIGHT MISTAKE
YOUR FAKE HISTORY FOR REAL
HISTORY?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK THAT DESPITE WHAT YOU
SAY, AND THERE'S A LOT TO THAT,
THE POPULARITY OF BOOKS LIKE
BIOGRAPHYIES MEAN THAT THERE'S
AT LEAST AN AUDIENCE, A BOOK
READING AUDIENCE THAT DOES READ
HISTORY.
I HOPE WE'LL FIGURE OUT THAT
PERHAPS --
>> Stephen: IN MY ALTERNATIVE
AMERICA THIS THING IS NUMBER
ONE.
>> THIS COULD BE AN ALTERNATE
HISTORY I COULD FERVENTLY
EMBRACE, IT LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY.
>> Stephen: JEFF GREENFIELD,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE BOOK IS
