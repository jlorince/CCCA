MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PROFESSOR
OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FROM THE
DEPARTMENT OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AND ENGINEERING AT MIT.
I'LL ASK HIM WHAT THE HELL I

MEANS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PLEASE WELCOME, DONALD SADOWAY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHAT IS THAT -- MATERIAL
CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE,
WHAT DO YOU DEAL WITH?
LIKE ODD STRANGE MATERIAL?
>> NO, IT'S THE SCIENCE OF
INVENTING NEW MATERIALS,
MATERIALS THAT INVOLVE NEW MIXES
OF ATOMS AND WAYS THAT GIVE US
PROPERTIES WE HAVEN'T HAD
BEFORE.
>> STEPHEN: CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW TO GET STIC'EM OFF A GLASS
THAT I BUY AT CRATE AND BARREL?
BECAUSE THAT STUFF WILL SURVIVE
REENTRY.
>> THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF
MODERN MATERIAL SCIENCE AT WORK.
>> STEPHEN: DO ALL MODERN
MATERIALS PISS ME OFF AS MUCH AS
THAT?
>> NOT INTENDED TO.
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE STORE AND
GET THE GOO-OFF STOONCHTS SURE.
GETTING YOU ON THE BACK END.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SIR, YOU'VE GOT A DREAM.
TELL THE PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR DREAM
FOR A MORE PEACEFUL AND
PROSPEROUS WORLD, WHAT IT ALL
RESTS ON.
>> IT THINK A PEACEFUL AND
PROSPEROUS WORLD RESTS ON THE
INVENTION OF MODERN COST
AFFORDABLE BATTERIES THAT CAN
RESTORE THE GRID, ENABLE US TO
USE PHOTO WIND TO DRAW
ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN WHEN
THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE AND ALLOW
US TO DRIVE CARS HUNDREDS OF
MILES ON A SINGLE CAR AND REDUCE
THE DEPENDENCE ON PETROLEUM.
>> STEPHEN: YOU CREATED THIS
LIQUID MET CALL BATTERY?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: THIS SAY PRETO
TYPE.
WHAT IS HAPPEN SOMETHING IN WHAT
IS THIS?
IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY
UNAPPETIZING GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICH.
LA OF LAUGH.
>> IT'S INEDIBLE.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY.
IT'S INEDIBLE?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: SO I CAN'T EAT
THIS?
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: IS IT POISONOUS.
>> IT'S INEDIBLE.
>> STEPHEN: YOU WON'T GOOD SO
FAR AS TO POISONOUS.
>> THE METAL ON THE TOP IS
MAGNESIUM AND THE BODY NEEDS
MAGNESIUM BUT THE METAL ON THE
BOTTOM IS ANDIMOD.
WE SHOULDN'T INGEST THAT.
>> STEPHEN: WHY DO WE NEED
BATTERY SNRCHLZ THE BATTERIES OF
TODAY ARE FAR TOO EXPENSIVE OR
LAST LONG ENOUGH.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR
LAPTOP COMPUTER AND YOUR CELL
PHONE.
>> STEPHEN: I TAKE THOSE ABOUT
THEORIES OUT AND I BURN THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU ARE A BRAVE MAN TO BE HERE
BECAUSE CERTAINLY SOMEONE AT
EXXON MOBILE HAVE MUST HAVE A
HIT OUT FOR YOU.
IS THIS GOING TO REPLACE WHAT
WE'RE USING NOW?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: IS THAT A PIPE
DREAM?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW DID YOU GET GUYS STARTED IS
THIS SOLYNDRA MONEY?
IS THIS OBAMA STIMULUS MONEY
THAT BUILT THE BATTERY?
>> THERE WAS STIMULUS MONEY.
>> STEPHEN: YOU JUST ADMITTED
IT'S STIMULUS MONEY AND THAT ALL
WENT TO SOLYNDRA.
PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS.
THERE'S A DIVISION OF DEPARTMENT
OF ENERGY.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE LAUGHING
BECAUSE I BUSTED YOU.
YOU ARE TOTALLY NAILED RIGHT
NOW.
>> NO, THERE'S A DIVISION OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY THAT FUNDS
BASIC RESEARCH, WHICH I THINK IS
THE LEGITIMATE ROLE OF
GOVERNMENT STOONCHTS SPEAKING OF
BASIC RESEARCH CAN'T I MAKE THIS
THING BY PUTTING TWO NAILS IN A
LEMON.
STHNT A BATTERY?
>> IT'S A BATTERY IF THE NAILS
ARE OF DIFFERENT COMPOSITION.
IF YOU TAKE TWO SIMILAR NAILS
YOU WON'T GET ANY VOLTAGE, NO.
>> STEPHEN: SO YOU BUILT A
BETTER LEMON?
>> NO A BETTER BATTERY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: WHAT HAPPENS IF I
TAKE A SLICE OF THIS AND PUT IT
IN MY COCKTAIL?
>> AH --
>> STEPHEN: YOU DON'T GET
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS AT MIT, DO
YOU?
>> NO, NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS A DIFFERENT LINE OF
INTERROGATION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: YOU SAY LIKE NEW
BATTERIES CAN LEAD TO WORLD
PEACE.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DOES A NEW
BATTERY LEAD TO WORLD PEACE?
>> ENOUGH BATTERIES EVERYWHERE
TO BRICK RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
EMERGENCY TO THE GRID AND USE
THAT TO POWER ELECTRICITY
VEHICLES, YOU GOWRING TO TOPPLE
DICTATORS, MAKE THINGS VERY,
VERY DIFFERENT WHEN THE PRICE OF
OIL GOES BACK TO $20 A BARREL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELL, SIR --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SOME ARE OF US HEAVILY INVESTED
IN OIL COMPANIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE NOT
GOING TO USE OIL I'M GOING TO
MAKE IT NO LONGER A STRATEGIC
COMMODITY.
WE WANT A BALANCE, A RICH MIX OF
OIL, GAS, NUCLEAR RENEWABLE.
IT'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE FULLY
DEPENDENT ON ONE SOURCE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE USING
STUDENTS AT MIRKS, T AS YOUR
WORK FORCE RIGHT NOW.
>> YES?
YOU DON'T PAY THEM, DO YOU?
>> YES, THEY GET A STIPULATE
YEND THEY GET THEIR TUITION PAID
FOR.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
JUST TREAT THEM LIKE INTERNS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IF THIS THING TAKES OFF ARE YOU
A GAJILLIONAIRE?
>> MAYBE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
