THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.
AND WHILE NOT ALL REPUBLICANS
AGREE WITH HERMAN CAIN'S
VISIONARY TAX PLAN, THEY DO ALL
AGREE ON ONE THING.
>> WE NEED SERIOUS REGULATORY
REFORM, NOT JUST REPEALING OBAMA
CARE, BUT ENDING THE E.P.A.'S
REGULATORY REIGN OF TERROR.
>> AND I GUARANTEE YOU THE
E.P.A. WILL HAVE DOORS LOCKED
AND THE LIGHTS TURNED OFF.
>> YOU'RE DOING NOTHING MORE
THAN KILLING JOBS.
IT IS A CEMETERY FOR JOBS AT THE
E.P.A.
>> STEPHEN: YES.
THIS JOB-KILLING CEMETERY IS
MURDERING JOBS AND THEN BURYING
THEM IN ITSELF.
JOBS.
EVERYONE KNOWS POLLUTION IS A
JOB CREATOR.
WHEN I WAS A KID MY FIRST JOB
WAS WORKING AT MY SIDEWALK
STAND.
AND, FOLKS, WE ALL KNOW,
COUNTRIES WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL
REGULATIONS ARE KILLING US IN
THE JOB MARKET.
JUST LOOK AT CHINA.
IT'S IN THERE SOMEPLACE.
[LAUGHTER]
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST
EMITTER OF GREENHOUSE GASSES,
AND IT ONLY HAS 4.1%
UNEMPLOYMENT.
PLUS, THANKS TO MERCURY
POISONING AND FACTORY SUICIDES,
POSITIONS ARE OPENING UP ALL THE
TIME.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, FOLKS, I HAVE ALWAYS, AND
THIS IS WELL-KNOWN, I HAVE
ALWAYS DESPISED THE JACK-BOOTED
BIRKEN STOCKS OVER AT THE
E.P.A., EVER SINCE IT WAS
CREATED BY THAT BLEEDING-HEART
LIBERAL RICHARD NIXON.
[LAUGHTER]
GET A HAIRCUT, HIPPIE.
OF COURSE, THE AGENCY WAS FORMED
BACK IN 1970.
BACK THEN AMERICA'S ECOSYSTEM
WAS FULL OF HAZARDOUS CFCS,
DDTS AND 3BGS, AND OHIO'S
CUYAHOGA RIVER WAS SO POLLUTED
THAT IT CAUGHT FIRE 11 TIMES.
WHO KNOWS WHAT CAUSED THAT?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN POLLUTION.
PERSONALLY I SUSPECT THE TROUT
TORCHED IT FOR THE INSURANCE
MONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THAT WAS THEN.
THIS IS NOW, RIGHT, JOHN
STOSSEL?
>> THANK GOODNESS FOR THE E.P.A.
THE AIR AND WATER ARE CLEANER
THAN THEY USED TO BE, BUT THEY
PASSED THOSE RULES.
THEY MADE THE AIR AND WATER
CLEANER.
IT'S DIMINISHING RETURNS.
THEY'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB.
STOP ALREADY.
STICK A FORK IN IT AND IT'S
DONE.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH, STOP
ALREADY.
WHEN SOMETHING IS CLEAN, YOU
DON'T NEED TO CLEAN IT ANYMORE.
THAT'S WHY I SOLD MY DISHWASHER
AND MY BIDET.
