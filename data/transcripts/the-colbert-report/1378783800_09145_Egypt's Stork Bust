(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
"REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITHUS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING"STEPHEN").
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
IN HERE; OUT THERE; AROUND THEWORLD, WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, I'M SURE I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THIS, BUT IAM WORRIED ABOUT EGYPT.
THOSE GUYS HAVE GOT THEIR HEADSUP THEIR SPANX.
(LAUGHTER)FIRST MUBARAK WAS IN, THEN
MUBARAK WAS OUT.
AND MORSI WAS IN, NOW MORSI ISOUT AND INSTEAD ARMY GENERAL AND
GEORGE LOPEZ OF THE DESERT ABDELFATTAH AL-SISI IS IN.
AND WITH TENSIONS RUNNING HIGH,FOLKS, EVERYONE IS SUSPECTING
EVERYONE ELSE OVER THERE AND IDON'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE THEY
ALL LOOK KIND OF MIDDLE EASTERN.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THANKFULLY THERE'S BEEN AN
IMPROVEMENT IN EGYPT'S SECURITYSITUATION.
FOR MORE WE TURN KTRT, HOUSTON'SEGYPT NEWS LEADER.
>> IN EGYPT, A STORK WAS BUSTEDAS A SUSPECTED SPY.
A CITIZEN THOUGHT THE BIRD WASAN UNDERCOVER AGENT BECAUSE IT
CARRIED A SUSPICIOUS ELECTRONICDEVICE.
>> Stephen: "SUSPICIOUSELECTRONIC DEVICE."
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE NEWIPHONE 5S?
(LAUGHTER)AND I SAY THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE I
WANT A FREE ONE.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, DON'T BELIEVE THIS STORK IS
A SPY?
SOME SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THATTHIS AGENT WAS INSTEAD A SWAN!
WHICH MEANS THIS STORK HAS ASECRET IDENTITY, A NOM DE
PLUMAGE.
(LAUGHTER)AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
THE ANIMAL KINGDOM HAS GOTCAUGHT UP IN MIDDLE EASTERN
ESPIONAGE.
AS I REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, EGYPTACCUSED ISRAELI AGENTS OF BEING
BEHIND A LOCAL SHARK ATTACK AND--
(LAUGHTER).
SAUDI ARABIA ARRESTED A VULTUREON SUSPICION OF SPYING FOR
ISRAEL.
(LAUGHTER)AND THEY ALSO ARRESTED A RABBIT
FOR BEING ONE LETTER AWAY FROM ARABBI.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, WHETHER HE TURNS OUT TO BEA SPY OR NOT, I CERTAINLY HOPE
EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS INTERROGATETHIS STORK UNTIL IT REVEALS
WHERE BABIES REALLY COME FROM.
(LAUGHTER)VAGINAS, INDEED!
(LAUGHTER)MAKES NO SENSE.
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY
