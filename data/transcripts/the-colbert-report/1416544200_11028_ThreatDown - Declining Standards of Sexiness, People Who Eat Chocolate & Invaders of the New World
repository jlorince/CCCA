HE'S NOT EVEN THE SEXIESTHEMSWORTH ALIVE.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBERTHREE, AMERICA'S DECLINING
STANDARDS OF SEXINESS.
THIS HAS TO BE SAID.
FIRST OF ALL AN AUSTRALIAN.
THERE'S NOTHING SEXY ABOUT THEAUSSIES.
YOU CAN'T SEE THEIR ABS BECAUSEOF THE POUCH THEY HAVE IN FRONT.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE TITLEGOINGS TO CHRIS HEMSWORTH, IT'S
ABOUT IT NOT GOING TO MATHEWMCCONAUGHEY.
FOLKS, THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,HE'S STILL ALIVE AND AS GOD IS
MY WITNESS, HE IS A MAN.
AND YET SOMEHOW HE HASN'T BEENTHE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE SINCE
2009.
IT'S BEEN NINE YEARS OF BUTTERFACES.
PLUS SEXINESS HISTORIANS WILLSOME DAY MARK THIS EPOCH AS THE
MCCONAUGHEY-SSAINCE.
IMAGINE IF DURING THERENNAISANCE PEOPLE MAGAZINE
HADN'T PUBLISHED THIS COVER.HEY, CROSSBOW TO MY HEAD, SURE.

I KNOW THINGS LOOK ROUGH NOW BUTJUST KEEP LIVING AND YOU'LL BE
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALLRIGHT,.

OF SYRUP, BAR, TACO OR WHATEVEREXTRUDED POLYMER
TOOTSIE IS. IF IT'S CHOCOLATE,IT GOES IN THE MOUTH
TOOTSIE IS. IF IT'S CHOCOLATE,IT GOES IN THE MOUTH
>> PEOPLE ARE EATING CHOCOLATEFASTER THAN COCOA FARMERS CAN
GROW THEIR CROPS.
WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OFCHOCOLATE IN FIVE YEARS.
IT'S GOING TO BE A CHOCOLATESHORTAGE.
WE'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH OF ITFOR AS MUCH AS WE'RE EATING.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OFCHOCOLATE WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
TODAY'S KATHY CARTOON. FOLKS.
DON'T DO IT, KATHY
DON'T DO IT, SISTER. THIS COCOACATASTROPHE BRINGS ME
TO NUMBER TWO. PEOPLE WHO EATCHOCOLATE WHO AREN'T ME
THIS SHORTAGE IS LARGELY DUETO THE RISING POPULARITY OF DARK
CHOCOLATE WHICH CONTAINS MORECOCOA THAN TRADITIONAL CHOCOLATE
BARS.
OH YES, DARK CHOCOLATE.
IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE MILKCHOCOLATE BUT WISHED IT TASTED
LESS GOOD. CREAMY, SWEET ANDDELICIOUS? I'LL PASS, THANKS
BRING ON THE BITTER.
SOON WE MAY RUN OUT OF CHOCOLATECOMPLETELY.
IT WOULD BE THE COCOAGEDDON.HERALDED BY THE 3 MUSKATEERS OF
THE APOCALYPSE. ALL THAT WOULDBE LEFT OF OUR CANDY BARS
IS CARAMEL, NOUGAT, PEANUTSAND CRSIPY WAFERS.
UGH  I WOULD RATHER EAT FRUIT
FINALLY FOLKS I ALWAYS LOVEDSTUDYING AMERICAN HISTORY FROM
GEORGE WASHINGTON CHOPPING DOWNTHE CHERRY TREE TO ABRAHAM
LINCOLN CHOPPING DOWN THOSEVAMPIRES.
OVER THE PAST WEEKEND I HEARD AFRIGHTENING CLAIM FROM TURKISH
PRESIDENT AND ELVISH GREETINGRECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN.
AND WHAT THIS MAN SAID COULDREWRITE AMERICAN HISTORY FASTER
THAN A TEXAS SCHOOL BOARD.
>> THE AMERICAN CONTINENT ISSAID TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY
COLUMBUS IN 1492. HOWEVER 314YEARS BEFOR COLUMBUS IN 1178
MUSLIM SAILORS REACHED THEAMERICAN CONTINENT.
THAT WAS IN 1178.>> Stephen:  WHAT?
MUSLIMS DISCOVERED AMERICA? THATDOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
1178 DOESN'T EVEN RHYME WITHSAIL THE OCEAN BLUE.
BUT FOLKS, AS DISTURBING AS ITIS, IT MAY BE TRUE BECAUSE THE
TURKISH PRESIDENT IS CITING ACHINESE DOCUMENT FROM 1178
CLAIMING MUSLIM SAILORS REACHEDCALIFORNIA.
AS WELL AS A PASSAGE FROMCOLUMBUS' JOURNAL IN WHICH HE
MENTIONS THE EXISTENCE OF AMOSQUE ON A HILL ON THE CUBAN
COAST, WHICH IS ALL THE PROOF INEED.
BECAUSE THE MAN WHO SET OUT FORCHINA, ONLY THE LAND IN THE
BAHAMAS AND DECLARES THE NATIVEPEOPLE INDIANS, NEVER GOT
ANYTHING WRONG.
AND THIS TURKISH --[CROWD CHEERING]
AND THIS TURKISH LACK OF DELIGHTBRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER ONE.
MUSLIM INVADERS OF THE NEWWORLD.
FOLKS THESE REVELATIONS MEAN NOTONLY ARE FOREIGNERS SNEAKING
OVER OUR BORDERS THEY'VE BEENDOING IT FOR SIX CENTURIES
LONGER THAN WE'VE HAD BORDERS.
THANKS A LOT 12TH CENTURY OBAMA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THIS REVELATION, THIS REVELATION
CALLS INTO QUESTION EVERYTHING IKNOW ABOUT EARLY AMERICAN
HISTORY.
WHAT'S NEXT, ARE PEOPLE GOING TOSAY COLUMBUS DIDN'T FIGHT THE
PILGRIMS AT THE BATTLE OF MIAMI.
IT SADDENS ME SOME PEOPLE WANTTO CHANGE THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF
AMERICA'S DISCOVERY.
CHRISTIANS I WAS TAUGHT.
LANDED ON THESE PRISTINE SHORESAND WERE WELCOME BY THE NATIVE
PEOPLE. AND THEN WE SPENT THENEXT FIVE
CENTURIES CARRYING OUT A BRUTALCAMPAIGN -- DO YOU
KNOW WHAT LET'S SAY THE MUSLIMSWERE HERE FIRST.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
