NOW NATION, I HOPE I DON'T HAVETO TELL YOU THAT AMERICA FACES
AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT FROM THEBRUTAL TERRORISTS IN I.S.I.S.,
ALSO KNOWN AS "THE ISLAMICSTATE."
(LAUGHTER)BY THE WAY, THAT IS NOT A
SAFETY SCHOOL.
(LAUGHTER)I.S.I.S. HAS BECOME MY OFFICIAL
NUMBER-ONE ENEMY.
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR NOW,RAISINS IN SALAD.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, PRESIDENT PACIFIST HERE HAS
FINALLY GOTTEN OFF THEPOT AND DECLARED KINDA-SORTA
WAR, WHICH IKINDA-SORTA SUPPORT.
(LAUGHTER)I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE ASKING,
"DOESN'T HE NEED CONGRESSIONALAPPROVAL TO DECLARE WAR?"
TO WHICH I RESPOND, "SHUT UP,GREG."
(LAUGHTER)CONGRESS ALREADY GAVE PRESIDENT
OBAMA ALL THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDSBACK WHEN HE WAS A BETTER
PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)JIM?
>> IT IS THE VIEW OF THISADMINISTRATION THAT THE 2001
AUMF CONTINUES TOAPPLY TO I.S.I.L.
>> Stephen: YES, THEAUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE
OF MILITARY FORCE" OR "AUMF"!
AUMF STILL APPLIES TO I.S.I.S.,EVEN THOUGH AUMF-CORDING TO THE
AUMF --(LAUGHTER)
-- THE PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZEDTO USE ALL NECESSARY AND
APPROPRIATE FORCE AGAINST THOSENATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS OR
PERSONS HE DETERMINES PLANNED,AUTHORIZED, COMMITTED OR AIDED
THE TERRORIST ATTACKS THATOCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.
OF COURSE, I.S.I.S. DID NOTATTACK US IN 2001.
THAT WAS AL QAEDA.
BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA FIXED THAT.
>> I.S.I.L. IS A TERRORISTORGANIZATION, PURE AND SIMPLE.
IT WAS FORMERLY AL QAEDA'SAFFILIATE IN IRAQ.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
IT WAS AFFILIATED WITHAL QAEDA -- SO THEY'RE
BOMBABLE NOW.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S LIKE IF CONGRESS GAVE THE
PRESIDENT AUTHORIZATION TO BOMBNIRVANA IN 1994, HE COULD STILL
BLOW UP THE FOO FIGHTERS TODAY.
(LAUGHTER)AFTER ALL, THEY HAVE DECLARED
JIHAD! (APPLAUSE)
DAVE GROHL HAS DECLARED JIHAD ONFOO!
(LAUGHTER)NOW, WHILE "I" FULLY SUPPORT THE
PRESIDENT'S PLAN OF DOING THISWITH JUST DRONE STRIKES, SOME
OPPOSE IT.
FIRST OF ALL, ME.
ALSO, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR ANDYOUR DISAPPROVING AUNT, LINDSEY
GRAHAM.
(LAUGHTER)>> IT'S GOING TO TAKE AN ARMY TO
BEAT AN ARMY.
AND THIS IDEA WE'LL NEVER HAVEANY BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO
DEFEAT THEM IN SYRIA IS FANTASY.
OUR STRATEGY WILL FAIL YETAGAIN.
THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISE TOTHE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL GET
KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WE'RE ALL GONNADIE!
HE'S SO BRAVE UP THERE!
(LAUGHTER)AND WORST OF ALL -- NO ONE WILL
BE ALIVE TO BLAME IT ON OBAMA!
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE IT'S TRUE, FOLKS,
WITHOUT GROUND FORCESIN SYRIA, EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND
CHILD IN THE UNITEDSTATES, INCLUDING PUERTO
RICO, GUAM AND AMERICAN SAMOA,ARE JUST DEAD MEN WALKING.
THOSE 30,000 I.S.I.S. FIGHTERSWILL KILL ALL 300 MILLION OF US
OVER COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND.
(LAUGHTER)FOR THAT MATTER, WE COULD ALL BE
DEAD BY THE END OF THISSENTENCE.
OKAY.
WE DODGED A BULLET THIS TIME,BUT WE COULD BE DEAD BY THE END
OF THIS SENTENCE.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE JUST LIVING ONBORROWED TIME.
(LAUGHTER)UNLESS I'M ALREADY DEAD RIGHT
NOW BECAUSE THIS SUREFEELS LIKE HEAVEN, EVERYBODY.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS -- FOLKS -- THANK YOU.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")THANK YOU, FOLKS.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
WHILE I APPLAUD MY FELLOWSOUTH CACKALACKIAN'S
STATESMAN-LIKE PANTS-CRAPPING, IWANT TO SAY, FOLKS,
PLEASE DO NOT PANIC.
HMM --THAT REALLY DOES NOT SOUND LIKE
ME. HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
(LAUGHTER)NOPE.
SAME AS ALWAYS.
106.2.
ALL RIGHT. AND HERE'S WHY,FOLKS. HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULDN'T
PANIC -- BECAUSE WE "WILL" HAVEGROUND FORCES, THANKS TO OUR
CLOSEST ALLY:  ANYONE WHO WILLDO IT.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS RULED OUTU.S. COMBAT TROOPS AND WILL RELY
ON THE IRAQI ARMY AND THESO-CALLED MODERATE SYRIAN
OPPOSITION.
>> KURDISH PESHMERGA FORCES AREFIGHTING ON THE FRONT LINES.
>> THE PESHMERGA WILL BE THEBOOTS ON THE GROUND.
>> Stephen: YES, THE IRAQIARMY, THE MODERATE SYRIAN
OPPOSITION, AND SOMETHING CALLEDTHE KURDISH PESHMERGA.
WHICH I BELIEVE IS AN AGGRESSIVEAND HIGHLY-LETHAL TYPE OF
YOGURT. (LAUGHTER)
NOW NATION, YOU KNOW, YOU WATCHTHE SHOW, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS
SUPPORT OUR TROOPS AND,APPARENTLY, THESE ARE THEM NOW.
AND I WOULD BUY EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM A BEER, OR WHATEVER
MUSLIMS ARE ALLOWED TO DRINK.
I'M GONNA SAY, PESHMERGA?
AND IF WE'RE GOING INTO SYRIA,THE KEY HERE, OF COURSE, IS THE
MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION, WHOMTHE "NEW YORK TIMES"
DESCRIBED AS "A DIVERSEGROUP RIVEN BY INFIGHTING,
WITH NO SHAREDLEADERSHIP."
WELL THAT'S GOOD.
CAUSE IF MOVIES HAVE TAUGHT USANYTHING, IT'S THAT A RAGTAG
BAND OF UNDERDOGS CAN OVERCOMEANY ODDS.
(LAUGHTER)I SAY THIS WAR IN SYRIA WILL BE
JUST LIKE EXPENDABLES 3, ANEXPENSIVE SEQUEL THAT NO ONE
WILL WANT TO SEE.
PLUS, WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF ARABPARTNERS.
THAT NUMBER?
IMAGINARY.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ISSO FAR UNWILLING TO NAME THOSE
ARAB PARTNERS.
BUT AS ONE SENIOR STATEDEPARTMENT OFFICIAL PUT IT, I
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THEIMPRESSION THAT THESE ARAB
MEMBERS HAVEN'T OFFERED TO DOAIRSTRIKES, BECAUSE SEVERAL OF
THEM HAVE.
>> Stephen: THERE IT IS.
AN ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL IS TELLINGUS THAT OUR UNNAMED ARAB
PATTERNERS DEFINITELY MAYBEWON'T "NOT" CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING! (LAUGHTER)
AND THAT QUOTE RAISE ASLOT OF QUESTIONS.
FIRST AND FOREMOST -- WHAT THEHELL IS GOING ON IN THAT CNN
GRAPHIC?
WE SEE A GLOBE, HIGHLIGHTING THEREGION IN QUESTION, SUDDENLY A
GENTLE BREEZE BLOWS A QUOTE ONTOTHE DESK OF WORLD AFFAIRS
THROUGH A GENTLE RAIN OF MAGICALNEWS DUST.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S CNN -- 24-HOUR COVERAGE
OF WHATEVER FLOATS BY.
AND THE REPORTING --
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
WE HAVE CONFIRMED THIS, THEREPORTING THERE IS DEAD-ON
BECAUSE MY GRAPHICS TEAM CANALSO CONFIRM THAT THE "BOSTON
GLOBE" NOW REPORTS THAT, WHILETRAVELING THROUGH EUROPE AND THE
MIDDLE EAST IN ORDER TO MOBILIZESUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION
AGAINST I.S.I.S., ANONYMOUSSTATE DEPARTMENT SOURCES, WHEN
PUSHED FOR SPECIFICS ON THEEXTENT OF ARAB NATION
INVOLVEMENT, BE IT AIR SUPPORT,GROUND SUPPORT, LOGISTICS OR
TECHNICAL SUPPORT, APPARENTLY,"DID NOT SAY WHICH ARAB NATIONS
HAD OFFERED TO CARRY OUTAIRSTRIKES."
(APPLAUSE)THE POINT IS,
-- THAT WAS LIKE 200 MAN-HOURSOF RENDERING.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS, THE ADMINISTRATION
WON'T IDENTIFY OUR ARABPARTNERS.
BUT THEY SWEAR WE HAVE "TONS" OFTHEM OUT THERE.
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO DO ALLKINDS OF STUFF WITH US.
JUST LIKE THE OTHER MEMBER OFTHE COALITION, OUR HOT CANADIAN
GIRLFRIEND.
SHE'S REAL.
SHE JUST CAN'T VISIT BECAUSESHE'S IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.
BUT SHE'S GOING TO HELP US FIGHTI.S.I.S.
I SWEAR!
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
