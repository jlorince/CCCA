(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
BOOK ABOUT BARACK OBAMA'S MOTHER
CALLED "A SINGULAR WOMAN."
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
I READ A SINGULAR PAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME JANNEY SCOTT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THE NAME OF THE BOOK IS, AS I
SAID "A SINGULAR WOMAN: THE
UNFOLD STORY OF BARACK OBAMA'S
MOTHER."
WHAT IS THE UNTOLD STORY AND IS
IT POSSIBLY A SCANDAL THAT HIS
OPPONENTS CAN USE AGAINST HIM IN
2012?
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, THE IDEA OF THE TITLE IS
THAT WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT BARACK
OBAMA'S FATHER.
HE WROTE A MEMOIR ALMOST
ENTIRELY "DREAMS FOR MY FATHER."
BUT HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT
HIS MOTHER.
>> Stephen: DID SHE HAVE NO
DREAMS?
>> I BELIEVE SHE PROBABLY DID.
ALL WE'VE REALLY KNOWN ABOUT
CHER THAT SHE WAS THE WHITE
WOMAN FROM KANSAS, THE WHITE
MOTHER FROM KANSAS ALWAYS PAIRED
TO THE BLACK FATHER FROM KENYA.
DURING THE CAMPAIGN WE HEARD
ABOUT HER AS THE SINGLE MOTHER
ON FOOD STAMPS OR, YOU KNOW, THE
IDEALISTIC WOMAN WHO WENT OFF
THE INDONESIA AND THAT'S THE
VERSION HE TELLS IN THE BOOK.
>> Stephen: THE BRAVE WOMAN WHO
RAISED HER CHILD IN KENYA
(LAUGHTER)
>> EXACTLY.
WE HAVE HEARD THAT STORY.
IN FACT, THE REAL STORY IS FAR
MORE INTERESTING THAN
OVERSIMPLIFIED VERSION WE'RE
AWARE OF.
THIS WAS A PERSONALLY WHO WAS
THOROUGHLY UNCONVENTIONAL.
OVER AND OVER MADE REMARKABLE
CHOICES THAT WOULD BE HARD TO
MAKE EVEN NOW BUT THIS IS BACK
IN THE '60s.
YOU KNOW, SHE AT 17 CONCEIVED A
CHILD WITH AN AFRICAN MAN AND
MARRIED HIM AT A TIME WHEN THERE
WERE NEARLY TWO DOZEN STATES
WITH LAWS AGAINST INTERRACIAL
MARRIAGE.
SHE THEN WENT OFF TO INDONESIA
WITH HIM AT AGE SIX WITH HER
SONS, HAD MARRIED AN INDONESIAN
MAN.
SHE WENT TO INDONESIA AT A TIME
OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL UPHEAVAL
IN THAT COUNTRY.
SO OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE MADE
REMARKABLE CHOICES AND HER STORY
SAYS A LOT OF LIFE... SHEDS
LIGHT ON THE PRESIDENT, THE
PERSON WHO I THINK MANY
AMERICANS DON'T FULLY
UNDERSTAND.
>> Stephen: WHAT DROVE HER TO DO
THESE THINGS?
IF IT WAS SUCH AN UNUSUAL THING,
WHY WOULD SHE GO TO INDONESIA?
>> I THINK SHE REALLY... SHE
FELL IN LOVE WITH AN INDONESIAN
IS WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE FELL IN LOVE FIRST WITH AN
AFRICAN, THAT MARRIAGE BLEW UP
VERY QUICKLY.
SHE THEN FELL IN LOVE WITH AN
INDONESIAN AND HE HAD TO GO BACK
TO INDONESIA, SHE WENT WITH HIM
AND DISCOVERED A FASCINATING
COUNTRY WHERE SHE FOUND HER SORT
OF... HER FUTURE CAREER AS AN
ANTHROPOLOGIST AND LATER IN
DEVELOPMENT AND IN MICROFINANCE.
SO SHE WAS A PERSON WHO WAS VERY
OPEN KIND OF EMOTIONALLY AND
INTELLECTUALLY AND ALLOWED
HERSELF TO BE TAKEN PLACES BY
THAT.
>> Stephen: WAS SHE A FEMINIST?
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE SAFE TO
SAY THAT.
BUT SHE DIDN'T ADHERE TO LABELS.
SHE DIDN'T CHOOSE ANY LABELS.
IN FACT, ONE PERSON SAID TO ME
THE ONLY LABEL SHE EVER EMBRACED
WAS ANTHROPOLOGIST.
>> HER OWN SON SAID SHE WAS A
LEFTY.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S QUITE
HOW HE PUT IT.
>> I THINK HE DID.
I THINK HE SAID SHE WAS A LEFTY
BOMB THROWER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THERE WAS NO....
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T MARRY A
KENYAN AND YOU DON'T MARRY AN
INDONESIAN IF YOU'RE
PRO-AMERICA.
A LOT OF GUYS OVER HERE, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SOME KANSAS
GUYS?
KIND OF INSULTING TO ALL OF US
HERE, US GUYS WHO....
>> Stephen: SHE ACTUALLY WHILE
SHE WAS BORN IN KANSAS SHE NEVER
REALLY LIVED MUCH OF HER LIFE IN
KANSAS AND SHE ENDED UP IN
HAWAII WHERE THESE THINGS
HAPPEN.
HAWAII IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND
OF SOCIETY THAN EVEN CONTINENTAL
UNITED STATES AT THE TIME.
VERY MULTIETHNIC, NO RACIAL
MAJORITY.
WHAT DROVE HER IS A SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES.
SHE WASN'T SOME KIND OF
VISIONARY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT SHE WAS
PARTICULARLY LEFTY.
AND SHE CERTAINLY WASN'T
ANTI-AMERICAN.
SHE REMAINED AN AMERICAN CITIZEN
FOR HER ENTIRE CAREER.
SHE SPENT THE BULK OF HER... THE
MAJORITY OF HER ADULT LIFE IN
INDONESIA, BUT NEVER GAVE UP HER
CITIZENSHIP.
>> Stephen: DID SHE RAISE BARACK
OBAMA OR WAS IT HIS
GRANDPARENTS?
>> NO, SHE DID.
SHE WAS THE DOMINANT INFLUENCE.
CERTAINLY IN THE FIRST....
>> Stephen: BUT SHE LEFT HIM
BEFIND THE UNITED STATES AND
WENT BACK OVER TO INDONESIA.
>> THAT'S SORT OF THE
OVERSIMPLIFIED VERSION.
SHE WAS IN INDONESIA WITH HIM
WHEN HE WAS TEN, SHE WANTED HIM
TO HAVE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE
EDUCATION SHE COULDN'T GET
THERE.
SHE SENT HIM BACK TO HER PARENTS
SO HE COULD GO TO A GREAT
SCHOOL.
SHE JOINED HIM, STAYED WITH HIM
UNTIL HE WAS CLOSE TO HIGH
SCHOOL, THEN SHE HAD GOTTEN TO A
POINT WHETHER W HER GRADUATE
WORK IN PURSUIT OF HER Ph.D.
WHERE SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO
INDONESIA AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO
GO.
AND HE STAYED WITH HER PARENTS
FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND SHI DID GO
BACK THERE.
I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS FIND
THAT HARD TO SWALLOW.
>> Stephen: I DO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SHE WAS JUGGLING A NUMBER OF
CONFLICTING OBLIGATIONS.
>> Stephen: SHE JUST SEEMS LIKE
SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW, HEY, LISTEN,
I DON'T WANT TO STEREOTYPE, BUT
SOMEBODY WHO LEAVES THEIR CHILD
BEHIND TO, YOU KNOW, PURSUE
THEIR OWN PERSONAL GOALS: LOOK,
YES, I WORK VERY HARD, I PURSUE
MY OWN PERSONAL GOALS, I HAVE A
VAGUE SENSE THAT I HAVE THREE
CHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I'M A GUY, OKAY?
AND I'M BRINGING HOME THE BACON.
DON'T WOMEN-- AND, AGAIN, I
DON'T WANT TO STEREOTYPE AND I
AM AS MUCH OF A FEMINIST AS ANY
GUY WHO DOESN'T SUPPORT FEMINIST
CAUSES.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT ISN'T IT... ISN'T THERE A
SPECIAL TUG ON A WOMAN TO BE
WITH YOUR CHILD?
AND SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.
>> NO, SHE WAS WITH HER CHILD.
>> Stephen: YOU JUST SAID SHE
WASN'T FOR A LOT OF IT.
>> NO, ACTUAL PLAY I SAID WAS
SHE WAS WITH HIM FOR THE FIRST
13 YEARS OF HIS LIFE BUT THEN IN
HIGH SCHOOL....
>> Stephen: THE KEY, FORMATIVE
HIGH SCHOOL YEARS.
>> PERHAPS, PERHAPS NOT.
MANY PEOPLE SEND THEIR CHILDREN
TO BOARDING SCHOOL.
PEOPLE WHO ARE ABROAD.
SHE MADE A CHOICE TO SEND HIM TO
HER PARENTS FOR A PARTICULARLY
GOOD SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: LISTEN, YOU'RE A
WOMAN.
WOMEN JUDGE OTHER WOMEN, RIGHT?
HARSHLY.
HARSHLY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU... GIVE
ME YOUR JUDGMENT ON THIS PERSON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HEY, I'M A JOURNALIST, YOU
KNOW?
MY JOB WAS TO WRITE HER STORY
AND TO PUT IT OUT THERE.
>> Stephen: YOU WON'T JUDGE HER?
>> I THINK SHE'S A FASCINATING
CHARACTER AND I THINK SHE SHEDS
A LOT OF LIGHT ON THE PRESIDENT
AND TO UNDERSTAND HER STORY IS
TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU SHE
WAS A GREAT MOTHER OR TERRIBLE
MOTHER.
THAT'S UP TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO
READ THE BOOK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THEY HAVE TO BUY THE
BOOK FIRST.
>> THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
JANNEY SCOTT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

OBAMA'S MOTHER."
