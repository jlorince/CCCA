THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAD ONMUSIC AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS
TALK ABOUT FRED ASTAIRE AND HOWHE WAS REALLY THE FIRST PERSON

SONG BOOK.
TONY CALLS IT THE FRED ASTAIRESONG BOOK

INCREDIBLE PERFORMERS ON THEPLANET AND COMPILED INTO THIS
BOOK AND WE CHOSE ALL THE SONGSFROM IT THAT WE REALLY LOVED.

THE BEST POPULAR SONGS.
WE PLAY IN CHINA, RUSSIA,ISRAEL, WE PLAY EVERYWHERE IN
THE WORLD AND EVERYBODY IN THEWORLD KNOWS THESE AMERICAN
SONGS.
>> WE JUST SANG IN TEL AVIVTOGETHER.
