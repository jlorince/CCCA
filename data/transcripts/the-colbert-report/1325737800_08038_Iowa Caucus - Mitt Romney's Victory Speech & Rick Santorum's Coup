[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,
EVERYBODY.
FORGIVE ME IF I'M A LITTLE
JITTERY.
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT
WATCHING THE IOWA CAUCUSES, AND
TODAY I MAY HAVE HAD ONE TOO
MANY VENTI METH-A-CCINOS.
AS YOU KNOW, MITT ROMNEY WAS NOT
DECLARED THE VICTOR IN IOWA
UNTIL 1:30 A.M.
AND MITT USUALLY DOESN'T STAY UP
THAT LATE UNLESS HE'S GOT
HEARTBURN FROM A PARTICULARLY
SPICY WHEAT THIN.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT LAST NIGHT ROMNEY REWARDED
HIS HARD-WORKING TROOPS WITH A
ROUSING IMPROMPTU VICTORY
SPEECH.
>> O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS
SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN.
DOES CORN QUALIFY AS AMBER WAVES
OF GRAIN?
I GUESS NOT, BUT YOU GET THE
IDEA.
>> Stephen:, NO THAT WAS FROM
LAST WEEK.
I WANT LAST NIGHT'S VICTORY
SPEECH.
>> O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS
SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN.
DOES CORN QUALIFY AS AMBER WAVES
OF GRAIN?
I GUESS NOT, BUT YOU GET THE
IDEA.
>> Stephen: NO, NO, FROM
THURSDAY.
>> O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS
SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN.
>> Stephen: NO, THAT'S FROM
MONDAY.
I WANT LAST NIGHT'S SPEECH, MITT
ROMNEY PROVED BY THE MOMENT.
>> O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS
SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, JIM.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
I THINK WE'LL ALL REMEMBER
EVERYWHERE WE WERE EVERY TIME WE
HEARD THAT.
OF COURSE, IT WAS NOT A
RESOUNDING VICTORY.
FORMER SENATOR AND WORLD'S
PALEST DARK HORSE RICK SANTORUM
LOST IOWA BY ONLY EIGHT VOTES,
WHICH IS SIX 1,000thS OF 1%.
TO PUT THAT IN LAYMAN'S TERM,
ROMNEY GOT THE VOTE OF EVERY
BLACK REPUBLICAN IN IOWA.
SANTORUM'S NEAR VICTORY PROVES
THAT MONEY HASN'T TAKEN OVER OUR
POLITICAL PROCESS NO MATTER HOW
HARD I TRY.
ONE MAN WITH A VISION, A
WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD AND A
LASER-LIKE HOMOPHOBIA CAN STILL
MAKE A MARK.
BUT SANTORUM SCORED AN EVEN
BIGGER VICTORY LAST NIGHT
BECAUSE THIS MORNING FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS, WHEN
I GOOGLED THE WORD "SANTORUM,"
THE FIRST RESULT WAS FOR RICK
SANTORUM.
YES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THE CRUEL DEFINITION OF A FROTHY
MIXTURE OF LUBE AND FECAL MATTER
WAS FITTINGLY AT NUMBER TWO, SO
SENATOR SANTORUM, I HOPE YOU'RE
FEELING A FROTHY
