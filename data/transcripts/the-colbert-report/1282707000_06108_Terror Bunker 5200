DRESSES YOU FUNNY.
NATION, NATION, I NORMALLY DON'T
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT JON STEWART,
OKAY.
NO FREE RIDES GUY WHO STARTED MY
CAREER.
LAST NIGHT I WAS DOING A
HIGH-DEF GRAY HAIR COMPARISON,
AND I'M COMING FOR YOU, GRANDPA.
AND WHILE I WAS DOING, THAT I
ACCIDENTALLY SAW HIS REPORT ON
THE MAN FUNDING THE GROUND ZERO
MOSQUE, PRINCE AL-WALEED BIN
TALAL, WHO FOX NEWS HAS ACCUSED
OF HAVING TERROR TIES BECAUSE HE
ALLEGEDLY FUNDS RADICAL
MADRASES.
NOW, JON POINTED OUT THAT WHILE
THE TERROR MOSQUE MAY BE FUNDED
BY BIN TALAL, HE'S ALSO THE
SECOND LARGEST SHAREHOLDER OF
NONE OTHER THAN FOX NEWS, SO TO
DEFEAT TERROR, WE SHOULD REALLY
STOPWATCHING FOX NEWS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL PLAYED.
WELL PLAYED, MY FRIEND, BUT
THERE IS MORE TO THIS STORY.
FOLLOW ME DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.
TO "THE COLBERT REPORT" TERROR
BUNKER 5200.
[SIREN BLARES]
[APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
WELCOME TO THE TERROR BUNKER,
WHERE FEAR CRAPS ITS PANTS.
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS, LET'S FOLLOW
THE MONEY.
HERE'S THE BAD GUY, PRINCE
AL-WALEED BIN TALAL.
TURNS OUT BESIDES FUNDING THE
TERROR MOSQUE, HE'S ALSO
CHANNELED MONEY TO HIS SON,
KHALED BIN TALAL, WHO LAST
JANUARY FUNNELED THAT CASH
THROUGH A QUESTIONABLE ONLINE
ART AUCTION, THE PROCEEDS OF
WHICH WENT STRAIGHT TO AN
OBSCURE WASHINGTON, D.C.,
CHARITY.
NOW, HOW DO I KNOW ALL THIS?
WHO TIPPED ME OFF?
I DID.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE THE ART THAT BIN TALAL
BOUGHT WAS MY PORTRAIT FROM MY
OLD SET.
AND THE CHARITY WAS THE YELLOW
RIBBON FUND, WHICH HELPS WOUNDED
VETERANS AT WALTER REED AND
BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL.
THAT MAKES THEM TERROR TROOPS.
THINK ABOUT IT.
THESE SOLDIERS HAVE MADE
MULTIPLE TRIPS TO RADICAL
ISLAMIC COUNTRIES WHERE THEY
WERE TRAINED IN THE USE OF
WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES.
AND NOW THEY'RE COMING HOME.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW ALL THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME,
BUT WHY IS MY PORTRAIT MIXED UP
IN THIS?
JIMMY, GO FULL FRAME.
NOW ZOOM IN.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, FURTHER BACK, FURTHER
BACK, FURTHER BACK.
NOW ENHANCE.
OH, MY GOD!
I'M A TERRORIST.
IF I'M A TERRORIST CONNECTED TO
BIN TALAL, WHY DID THEY LET ME
BUILD MY STUDIO SO CLOSE TO
GROUND ZERO?
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE.
I MEAN, IT'S...
[APPLAUSE]
IT'S FIVE MILES.
THAT'S LESS THAN A 10K.
I COULD RUN THAT FOR CHARITY.
A TERROR CHARITY.
FOLKS, I HAVE TO BE STOPPED.
NATION, I NEED YOU TO COME HERE
AND PROTEST UNTIL MY STUDIO IS
SHUT DOWN AND I AM TAKEN OFF THE
AIR.
NO, WAIT, THAT'S JUST WHAT I
WANT.
I WANT TO HAVE NO ONE SEE WHAT
I'M DOING.
WHY ELSE WOULD I BE ON BASIC
CABLE?
NOW I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
EVERYONE IN AMERICA NEEDS TO
WATCH MY SHOW.
LET'S KEEP THIS GUY IN THE
SPOTLIGHT.
IN FACT, IN FACT, LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY RIGHT OVER
THERE.
[SIREN BLARES]
[APPLAUSE]
FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO THANK
KHALED BIN TALAL FOR HIS
GENEROUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE
YELLOW RIBBON FUND AND THANK OUR
CORPORATE SPONSOR, AT&T, FOR
MATCHING HIS CONTRIBUTION.
I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION: WHICH||
