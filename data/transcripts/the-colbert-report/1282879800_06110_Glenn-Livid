>> SPEAKING OF FOX NEWS, NATION,
I AM BRIMMING WITH ANTICIPATION.
I FEEL LIKE A GIDDY SCHOOL GIRL
ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE NIGHT
BEFORE I MARRY SANTA.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE IN JUST TWO DAYS,
SATURDAY, AUGUST 28th, GLENN
BECK'S RESTORING HONOR TO
AMERICA CEREMONY WILL BE HELD IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
AND THIS ISN'T JUST SOME PICNIC,
THIS IS THE PICNIC THAT CHANGES
EVERYTHING.
>> IT MAY NOT CHANGE AMERICA
TOMORROW.
IT MAY.
IT MAY NOT CHANGE AMERICA
TOMORROW.
I KNOW IT WILL IN 25 YEARS.
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE THERE WILL BE
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY OR GIRL
THAT WILL RISE TO BE THE NEXT
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THANKS TO GLEN
SOME BEAUTIFUL EIGHT-YEAR-OLD
WILL GROW UP TO BE A
HATCHET-WIELDING TOOTHLESS SLAVE
OWNER.
AND TO THE CRITICS OUT THERE IN
THE LAME-STREAM MEDIA WHO SAY
THAT
A FORMER MORNING ZOO D.J. CAN'T
CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY,
MAY I REMIND YOU THAT MOTHER
THERESA STARTED OUT AS MAMA T
AND LARRY LEPER WITH THE BLACK
HOLE OF CALCUT-UPS!
Z-95 PUTS THE BANG IN BANGALORE!
NOW, NO SURPRISE, FOLKS.
THE RESTORING HONOR HATERS OUT
THERE ARE UPSET THAT GLENN IS
HOLDING HIS 8/28 RALLY ON THE
STEPS OF THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL,
THE EXACT LOCATION AND DATE OF
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S "I HAVE A
DREAM" SPEECH.
WELL, BIG WHOOP.
8/28 IS ALSO THE BIRTHDAY OF
JASON PRIESTLEY.
YOU DON'T SEE HIS PANTIES IN A
BUNCH.
THOUGH I WOULDN'T MIND.
BESIDES, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH KING.
>> SOMEBODY SAID ABOUT ME THE
OTHER DAY BECAUSE I'M DOING THIS
EVENT ON 8/28 AND IT'S THE
ANNIVERSARY OF MARTIN LUTHER
KING AND GLENN BECK IS HIJACKING
THAT MOVE.
, WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS, THE
REPLACEMENT FOR MARTIN LUTHER
KING.
FIRST OF ALL, NO.
SECOND OF ALL, YES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I'D SAY THAT ABOUT
COVERS IT.
HE'S NOT TRYING TO REPLACE
DR. KING, AS HE TOLD KING'S
NIECE.
>> AFTER WE ANNOUNCED IT, I WENT
DOWN AND I STOOD ON THE STARE
WHERE YOUR UNCLE STOOD, AND I'M
GOING TO CHOKE UP JUST TALKING
ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO GET
CHOKED UP LISTENING TO YOU TALK
ABOUT IT.
I'M SORRY.
KEEP GOING.
>> IT IS... WHAT WENT THROUGH MY
MIND WAS, WHO THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?
IT IS SUCH AN HISTORIC PLACE TO
BE.
PEOPLE ARE SAYING NOW THAT I AM
TRYING TO DISTORT CIVIL RIGHTS
HISTORY, I'M TRYING THE STEAL
HIS LEGACY, ET CETERA, ET
CETERA.
NOTHING OF THE KIND.
I AM GOING TO BE SEVERAL STAIRS
DOWN FROM WHERE HE STOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SEVERAL STAIRS
DOWN.
THAT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
IN THE SAME WAY I MAY PLAN TO
GROW A CHIN-STRAP BEARD, MARRY A
GIRL AND GO TO THE FORD THEATER
TO GET SHOT IN THE HEAD, BUT NOT
LIKE LINCOLN, SEVERAL ROWS DOWN.
AND I'M IN THE ONLY ONE HOPING
TO GET SHOT IN THE HEAD.
SO IS GLENN BECK.
>> I'M NOT SUICIDAL.
I'M NOT DEPRESSED.
I DON'T LIKE TO SWIM WITH THE
FISHES.
I DON'T LIKE CONCRETE BOOTS.
I'M A VERY GOOD DRIVER.
I JUST HAD MY BRAKES CHECKED.
SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, I THINK
YOU MIGHT KNOW WHO DID IT.
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD, GLEN'S
CHALKBOARD IS GOING TO KILL HIM.
SO, SO BESIDES THE DATE, THE
LOCATION, THE MARCH AND THE
THREAT OF ASSASSINATION, THIS
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KING.
IT'S ABOUT SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE.
>> MY CRITICS ARE RIGHT.
I DO HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON
WITH HOWARD BEALE.
>>THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF ME.
THEY'RE AFRAID OF YOU, JUST LIKE
GANDHI.
I HADN'T SEEN JESUS IN WHAT HE
WOULD DO IN TALK SHOW ON FOX,
BUT I'M GOING TO TRY.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,
HOWARD BEALE, GANDHI, JESUS AND
MARTIN LUTHER KING?
GLENN'S NOT JUST A TALK SHOW
HOST, HE'S THE MIGHTY MORPHIN
POWER MARTYR!
HE IS THE SAVIOR, THE ONE.
SOON GLENN WILL BE APPEARING
MANY AMERICA'S GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICHES INSTEAD OF THE
CURRENT ARRANGEMENT WHERE
GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES APPEAR
INSIDE GLENN.
THE DAY OF RECKONING IS UPON US,
BUT I AM READY, GLENN.
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
I WILL DRINK THE KOOL-AID.
MY NIKES ARE ALL LACED UP.
I'M READY TO FOLLOW YOU ON TO
YOUR SILVER FREEDOM SPACESHIP
THAT RUNS ON HUMAN TEARS.
I AM SURE, I AM CONFIDENT THAT
YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE THE MOST
INSPIRING, MIRACULOUS
WORLD-CHANGING SPEECH IN HUMAN
HISTORY.
IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE.
IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING.
IT'S GOING TO BE IN-CRAZING.
RIGHT, GLENN?
>> IT IS GOING TO BE AN HISTORIC
MOMENT.
IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A SHOCK
WAVE TO THIS NATION.
SOMETHING MIRACULOUS IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THIS EVENT DOWN AT THE LINCOLN
MEMORIAL IS A DEFIBRILLATOR TO
THE HEART OF AMERICA.
8/28 WILL BE A MIRACLE, AND
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE THINGS
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD.
>> Stephen: YES, IT MUST, AND
WHAT IS THE TRUTH THAT YOU WERE
ASKING ALL OF AMERICA TO GATHER
AT YOUR FEET TO HEAR?
>> TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS FOUR.
[LAUGHTER]
