BUT FIRST, FOLKS, SAD NEWS.
THIS WEEKEND WE LOST A TRUE
LEGEND OF JOURNALISM WITH THE
PASSING OF WHITE HOUSE REPORTER
AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW HELEN
THOMAS.
HELEN COVERED TEN PRESIDENTS
OVER HER 60-YEAR CAREER, AND HER
FELLOW JOURNALISTS ARE
REMEMBERING HER WITH TRIBUTES,
ANECDOTES, AND IN THE CASE OF
GERALDO RIVERA, BY POSTING A
NAKED SELFIE ON TWITTER.
THOUGH COME TO THINK OF IT, THAT
MIGHT NOT HAVE A TRIBUTE TO
HELEN.
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT KILLED
HER.
MAN, HE LOOKS GOOD.
HE LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
LOOK HOW WELL DEFINED DOWN HERE
THESE... I'M NOT SURE.
MY PEOPLE HAVE NO WORD FOR THAT
MUSCLE.oá]?ñ
SAME WAY TO HEREBYIANS HAVE NO
WORD FOR SNOW.
THE FLYING BUTTRESSES, I
SUPPOSE.
NO SURPRISE THAT GERALDO IS ONCE
AGAIN BLAZING TRAILS HERE OR, IN
THE CASE OF HIS HAPPY TRAIL,
WAXING IT.
AND THE TRAIL HE'S BLAZING,
FOLKS, IS FOR THE SEXY SENIORS
OUT THERE.
AS GERALDO WROTE IN HIS TWEET,
"70 IS THE NEW 50."
EXACTLY.
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING PEOPLE
WANT TO SEE ON THEIR TWITTER
FEEDS, IT'S NAKED 50-YEAR-OLD
MEN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'VE GOT ONE YEAR TO GET MY
[BLEEP] TOGETHER.
AND AS GERALDO SAID IN HIS
TWEET, "ERICA AND FAMILY ARE
GOING TO BE SO PISSED... BUT AT
MY AGE..." YES, AT HIS AGE, HE
HAS CLEARLY LOST ALL JUDGMENT.
AND ALSO HAS FEWER YEARS TO HAVE
TO LIVE THIS DOWN.
AND IT IS GREAT TO SEE GERALDO
JOIN THE LONG TRADITION OF
JOURNALISTIC BEEFCAKE.
I MEAN, WHO COULD FORGET WALTER
CRONKITE'S FAMOUS SIGN-OFF, "AND
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
NOW WATCH MY PECS DANCE."
