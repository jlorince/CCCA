>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, NORMALLY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE ABOUT AUSTRALIA.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IT'S JUST A GODFORSAKEN ISLAND INFESTED WITH CRIMINALS AND
CREATURES DESIGNED TO TRICK ME INTO LIKING BEARS.
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.
LOOK AT HIS LITTLE FACE AND HIS FUZZY EARS.
BITE IT, BITE IT!
JIMMY, QUICK, MAKE HIM SCARY.
[ROARS]
THAT'S BETTER.
BUT, FOLKS, THERE'S A TRAGEDY THAT'S UNFOLDING DOWN UNDER THAT EVEN I CAN'T IGNORE.
THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING A SPERM SHORTAGE.
WHAT HAPPENED, AUSTRALIA?
DID A DINGO STEAL YOUR BABY BATTER?
[LAUGHTER]
APPARENTLY THIS MAN DROUGHT IS DUE THE A NEW LAW THAT ALL SPERM DONORS MUST PROVIDE IDENTIFYING
INFORMATION SO THE CHILD CAN CONTACT THEM ONCE THEY REACH 18.
I UNDERSTAND WHY MEN HAVE STOPPED DONATING.
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY.
SOMETIMES A GUY JUST WANTS TO SPEND A CRAZY AFTERNOON IN A STERILE ROOM WITH PLASTIC CUP.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT AUSTRALIANS ARE TURNING TO THE UNITED STATES WHERE SOME CLINICS
ARE PAYING OVER $700 PER VILE OF AMERICAN SPERM.
SO ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,
AN AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT COULD BE PULLING DOWN AN EXTRA $80,000 A WEEK.
BUT FACE IT, YEAH, LET'S FACE IT, AUSTRALIA, YOU'RE REALLY
ROLLING THE DICE WHEN YOU'RE NOT BUYING CELEBRITY-ENDORSED SEMEN.
THANKFULLY FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN MARKETING MY OWN PREMIUM MAN
SEED, STEPHEN COLBERT'S FORMULA 401.
EACH BATCH FEATURES OLD-WORLD CRAFTSMANSHIP USING TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR CENTURIES.
AND FORTUNATELY FOR AUSTRALIA, I HAVE PRODUCED A SPECIAL AUSSIE VERSION, FORMULA 401 G'DAY.
[SPEAKING AS CROCODILE DUNDEE:]
THAT'S NOT A SPERM SAMPLE.
THIS IS A SPERM SAMPLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS SPECIAL BATCH OF CROC JUICE WAS FORMED IN THE BATHROOM OF AN OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE.
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT A BLOOMING ONION THAT REALLY MAKES MY DIDGERI-DOO.
NOW, FOLKS...
[APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, THIS KANGA-GOO HAS A FULL MONEYBACK GUARANTEE, SO ORDER NOW AND THROW ANOTHER SHRIMP IN
THE BARBARA.
REMEMBER...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
