THE THUNDERING HERD TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)'COURSE, ME HAVING THAT LUGGAGE
IS A MAJOR SCOOP BECAUSE, RIGHTNOW, WE'RE IN THE THICK OF WHAT
WE IN THE TV BIZ CALL "SWEEPS,"WHEN BROADCASTERS PULL OUT ALL
THE STOPS TO BOOST RATINGS.
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VETRIED EVERYTHING FROM ADORABLE
ANIMALS TO ON-AIR COLONOSCOPIES,TO LESBIAN KISSES, TO NEIL
CAVUTO'S TOPLESS WEEK. BUT AS ABROADCAST JOURNALIST,
I BELIEVE ALL THAT ARE JUSTCHEAP PUBLICITY
STUNTS, AND SO DO THESE LESBIANPUPPIES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITHSWEEPS, THESE LESBIAN PUPPIES
ARE GONNA GIVE ME ARECTAL EXAM.
I'M GONNA JAM A VIENNA SAUSAGEUP THERE AND LET THEM DIG FOR
POLYPS.
ANYWAY THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT.
SO SET YOUR TiV0s.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BLOWING ITOUT FOR RATINGS, NO ONE BLOWS
HARDER THAN "GOOD MORNINGAMERICA."
THEIR ACTUAL NEWS GUY, MATTGUTMAN, DEDICATED MUCH OF LAST
WEEK TO SOMETHING EVERY AMERICANCAN RELATE TO -- FIGHTING OFF
BEARS AND SHARKS.
>> BACK NOW AT 7:42 WITH THEKICKOFF OF GMA SURVIVAL WEEK.
WE HAD TO SPEND A DAY WITH A1,300-POUND GRIZZLY.
I EVEN FELT ITS HOT BREATH ON MYFACE.
THIS TIME I HAD TO JUMP INTO THEDEEP END TO LEARN HOW TO FEND
OFF SHARKS WITH MY HANDS ANDFEET.
THIS MORNING, WE ASK WHAT WOULDYOU DO IF THE PLANE YOU WERE ON
PLUNGED INTO THE WATER?
>> YES, THAT IS NEWS YOU CANUSE.
NOW I KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEPLANE I'M ON CRASHES INTO
SHARK INFESTED WATERS, AND THEPILOT IS A GRIZZ!
(LAUGHTER)AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW I BELIEVE
BEARS ARE GODLESS KILLINGMACHINES.
OKAY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT WAS THESE BEAR TIPS I FOUND
PARTICULARLY USEFUL.
>> I'M SPEECHLESS RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS A 1,300-POUND GRIZZLYBEAR WRESTLING WITH A 200-POUND
MAN.
>> WRESTLE!
WRESTLE!
>> IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU SEE AMAN PUT HIS HEAD INSIDE A
GRIZZLY'S MOUTH WILLINGLY.
DOES IT HURT TO HAVE YOUR HEADINSIDE OF A BEAR'S MOUTH?
>> NOT REALLY.
OKAY, KIDS.
G.M.A. SAYS IF A BEAR ISATTACKING YOU, THE BEST LINE OF
DEFENSE IS TO LODGE YOUR HEAD INITS JAWS.
AFTER YOU SLAP HIM SOME 69.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERING)
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERING)
I THINK WE HAVE THE STATE DRUMLINE HERE TONIGHT!
AND ONCE THE MAULING ISUNDERWAY, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
YOU CAN DO TO REMAIN MINIMALLYCHEWED.
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO SURPRISETHEM.
YOU WANT TO LET THEM KNOW THATYOU'RE IN THE AREA.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TOCALCULATE, DO YOU RUN?
DO YOU STAND?
>> NEVER RUN.
ABSOLUTELY NEVER RUN UNDER ANYCONDITIONS.
YOU WOULD TALK IN MONOTONES.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG HERE.
THEN SLOWLY BACK AWAY.
>> Stephen: YES, VERYIMPORTANT.
TALK IN MONOTONES.
(IN SOFT VOICE... )HEY, BEAR, LET'S TALK THIS OUT.
YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME.
I SAW A CHUBBY KID BACK DOWN THETRAIL.
YOU SHOULD EAT HIM.
HERE'S SOME BARBECUE SAUCE.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THESE G.M.A. TIPS AREABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO SURVIVE
AN ATTACK THAT G.M.A. JUST ASCRITICALLY ADMITS WILL NEVER
HAPPEN.
>> EXPERTS SAY YOU'RE 250 TIMESMORE LIKELY TO DIE OF A
LIGHTNING STRIKE THAN A BEARATTACK.
>> THAT MAY BE.
BUT THERE'S AN EASY WAY TOREDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF DYING
FROM LIGHTNING.
SINCE IT NEVER STRIKES TWICE,MAKE SURE TO GET STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING ONCE.
AND, FOLKS, IT TURNS OUT THEREARE A LOT OF THINGS MORE
DANGEROUS THAN SHARKS AND BEARS.
FOR INSTANCE, SHARKS INJUREABOUT 13 AMERICANS A YEAR.
WHILE AS MANY AS 13,250 ARE HURTBY BUCKETS AND PAILS.
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THEDANGER COULD BE LURKING IN YOUR
CLOSET.
TONIGHT, I LAUNCH MY OWNRATINGS-BOOSTING SURVIVAL
SEGMENT.
