HI!
COME ON IN!
WELCOME PEOPLE.
SILT DOWN.
WELCOME TO THE BRIDGE OF THE INTREPID WHERE I AM BROADCASTING FROM AN EXACT
REPLICA OF MY STUDIO BUILT RIGHT INSIDE THE SHIP.
IT IS SO EXCITING.
LAST NIGHT I LAUNCHED A CRUISE MISSILE.
(LAUGHTER) MY APOLOGIES TO THE PEOPLE OF WEE HAWKIN.
FOLKS, SPEAKING OF BLOWING UP ON SATURDAY MITT ROMNEY ANNOUNCED PAUL RYAN AS HIS
VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK.
AND EVERY NEWS ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN CLAMOURING TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE DYNAMISH DUO BUT ONLY ONE PUBLICATION HAD A REPORTER OUT THERE ON THE BUS ON DAY ONE.
PEOPLE MAGAZINE.
OORS MITT ROMNEY CALLS IT,
CORPORATIONS MAGAZINE.
(LAUGHTER) A REPORTER FROM PEOPLE JOINED ROMNEY AND RYAN ON THE CAMPAIGN BUS THE DAY
AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND FILED ONE OF THE MOST PENETRATING FLUFF PIECES IN
THIS WEEK'S ISSUE.
IT'S TITLE ELED MITT ROMNEY AND PAUL RYAN, THE HONEYMOONERS.
NAMED FOR THAT GIDDY HONEYMOON PERIOD EARLY IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP WHEN EVERYTHING FEELS NEW AND
EXCITING BEFORE, INEVITABLY,
IT STAYS THAT WAY FOREVER.
NOW NOT THAT THAT DAY WAS ALL SMOOTH SAILING.
AS ROMNEY'S SON MATT EXPLAINED AT FIRST EVERYONE WAS PRETTY STIFF AND QUIET
BUT THEY BECAME FAST FRIENDS AT WHICH POINT EVERYONE WAS PRETTY STIFF AND TALKATIVE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW THESE MEN QUICKLY BONDED OVER THEIR MUTUAL INTERESTS AS ANN ROMNEY EXPLAINED
THEY'RE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ON THIS VERY INTELLECTUAL POLICY WALK LEVEL.
WELL NO SURPRISE.
THESE TWO REALLY LIKE POLICY.
MITT EVEN ADDED, I LIKE POLICY.
AND--  (LAUGHTER) WHEN ASKED WHAT BOOKS HE READS RYAN SAID I READ POLICY.
(LAUGHTER) CLEARLY THEY'RE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SHARING THEIR DEEPEST, INNER MOST POLICIES WITH ONE ANOTHER.
AND IF WE LECH THEM, THEY MAY EVEN SHARE THOSE POLICIES WITH US.
BUT RYAN PROVE ODD HIMSELF'S MAN OF MANY DIMENSIONS WHEN HE REVEALED HITS SECOND ONE.
QUOTE, I ADVICE ENTO LECTURES FROM THE GREAT COURSES IN THE CAR.
I'M LISTENING TO A GREAT ONE ON VOLTAIRE RIGHT NOW.
I ENJOY STUDYING THE ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH IS AN 18th CENTURY DEBATE.
YES, THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS A FASCINATING DEBATE BACK IN THE 18th CENTURY ABOUT
WHETHER SCIENCE AND REASON HAD A ROLE TO PLAY IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE.
A DEBATE THAT TO REPUBLICAN
