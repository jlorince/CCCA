ARE YOU GOING TO SEND PEOPLE TOMARS?
>> WE'RE ASPIRING TO SENDPEOPLE TO MARS.
>> I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC.
WHY?
THOUGH?
>> [LAUGHTER]>> I DO. I  MEAN I DO.
I HONESTLY THINK IT IS SUPEREXCITING,
A HUGE SCIENCE FICTION FAN.
BUT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO GO?
YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURES.
I THINK TWO MAIN REASONS.
ONE IS THAT IF HUMANITY IS ONMORE THAN ONE PLANET, IF WE ARE
A MULTI PLANET SPECIES, AND ASPACE RANK CIVILIZATION,
THEN CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT,HUMANITY AS WE KNOW IT,
CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD LIKELY
PROPAGATE THE FUTURE MUCHFURTHER THAN A SINGLE PLANET
SPECIES, AND ALTHOUGH WE'REQUITE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LIFE
ON EARTH, AT SOME POINT THEREIS LIKELY TO BE SOME
CALAMITY, EVENNATURAL, MAN MADE.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHATTHAT MIGHT BE?
>> THERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS.
I'M NOT A DOOMSDAY -- IDID SAY MULTIPLE PLANET --
NOT LIKE ANOTHER PLANET, BUT ADIFFERENT ONE.
ONE PLANET BUT A DIFFERENT ONE.
I REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANTTHAT WE ARE ON MULTIPLE PLANETS
AND A SPACE RANK CIVILIZATION--I THINK  THAT'S--
THAT SORT OF PRESERVES THEFUTURE OF HUMANITY, LIFE
INSURANCE COLLECTIVELY.
SOME OF THE DEFENSE ARGUMENT.
NOW, THE ONE I FIND ACTUALLYMORE INTERESTING OR MORE
MOTIVATING IS THAT IT WOULD BEJUST THE GREATEST ADVENTURE
EVER.
AND IT WOULD BE REALLY EXCITING.
INSPIRING.
>> BUT DANGEROUS.
JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF IS ANADVENTURE UNTIL YOU STOP
SUDDENLY.
>> RIGHT.
EXACTLY.
>> HAVING FAMILIES ANDEVERYTHING ON MARS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> MARS AIN'T THE KIND OF PLACEYOU RAISE YOUR KIDS.
>> [LAUGHTER]>> IT'S COLD AS HELL.
AND THERE IS NO ONE THERE TORAISE THEM IF YOU DID.
[LAUGHTER]>> WELL, I MEAN MY SORT OF TERM
FOR MARS IS THAT IT IS AFIXER UPPER PLANET.
IT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
TO TRANSFORM MARS ULTIMATELYINTO A EARTH LIKE PLANET,
