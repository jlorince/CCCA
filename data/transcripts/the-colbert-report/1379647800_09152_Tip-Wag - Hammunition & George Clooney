(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH FOLKS, YOUKNOW THEY SAY TWO WRONGS
DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.
BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT TOSAY THEY'RE WRONG TWICE.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, THEWAG OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, I'M NO FAN OF MUSLIM
EXTREMISTS BUT TO FIGHTEXTREMISTS SOMETIMES YOU
HAVE TO THINK LIKE EXTREMISTS,OR THE VERY LEAST KNOW THEIR
DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.
>> WOULD YOU EXPECT TO SEEPORK ON YOUR BREAKFAST PLATE
OR PERHAPS IN YOUR SAN WITCHBUT HOW ABOUT IN YOUR GUNS,
AMMUNITION?
>> Stephen: NO, I HAD NOTTHOUGHT OF THAT.
PLEASE GO ON.
>> A COMPANY IN NORTH IDAHOIS SELLING THESE BULLETS,
THEY'RE CALLED JIHAWG AMMO.
THEY TARGET ISLAMICEXTREMISTS BECAUSE IN THAT
RELIGIOUS ANYTHING MADE WITHPORK IS CONSIDERED UNCLEAN.
>> Stephen: NO UNCLEANWESTERN WILL BE ADMIT MOOD
PARADISE AN RECEIVE THE 72VIRGINS THEY ARE PROMISED
AFTER DEATH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW I DID NOT THINK IT WASPOSSIBLE BUT THEY HAVE MADE
BACON SLIGHTLY MORE BAD FORYOU.
(LAUGHTER)SO FOLKS, A TIP OF MY HAT TO
HAMUNITION.
YOU SEE NONHALAL BULLETS ARETHE PERFECT WAY TO SEN OUR
ENEMY THE MESSAGE THAT WEONLY LINLTED AT WHEN WE
KILLED THEM-- HINTED AT WHENWE KILLED THEM.
AND YOU CAN TRUST THE FOLKSAT JIHAWG BECAUSE ACCORDING
TO THEIR WEB SITE THEY CAMEUP WITH THE IDEA WHILE
SITTING AROUND A CAMP FIREENJOYING AN ADULT BEVERAGE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THAT IS, OF COURSE, ALWAYS
HOW YOU GET THE BEST IDEAS.
REMEMBER, JONAS SALK CAME UPWITH THE POLIO VACCINE WHILE
HUFFING RUST OLIUM AROUND ATRASH CAN FIRE.
AND JIHAWG DOES NOT SKIMP ONQUALITY.
THEY BRAG THAT THEIR PORCINECOATING IS INFUSED WITH THE
HIGHEST QUALITY PORKPRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE IN
AMERICA.
BECAUSE, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, WHEN YOU'RE
SHOOTING SOMEONE, YOU CANNOTSETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD PIG
SLURRY.
MY ONLY WORRY IS THAT NOAMERICAN IS GOING TO WASTE
BACON BULLETS ON THEIRENEMIES.
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TOFIRE THEM DIRECTLY INTO
THEIR OWN MOUTHS.
I KNOW I AM ALWAYS LOOKINGFOR FASTER WAYS TO GET
SALTED MEETS INTO MY FACE.
BUT AS GOOD AS THEY ARE,BULLETS ARE KIND OF SMALL
PORTIONS SO I'M CALL ONJIHAWG AMMO TO STEP IT UP
AND INVENT THE HAMGRENADE.
FOLKS, A WAG OF MY FINGER ATSEXIEST-- SEXIEST MAN ALIVE
GEORGE CLOONEY.
HE'S ALWAYS STICKING HISPERFECTLY FORMED NOSE WHERE
IT DOES NOT BELONG.
AND NOW HE IS DOING IT WITHTECHNOLOGY.
>> GEORGE CLOONEY HAS HISEYES IN THE SKIES.
THE ACTOR TELLS THE GUARDIANTHAT HE'S USING A SPY
SATELLITE TO TRACK THEDICTATOR OMAR AL-BASHIR.
HE KEEPS A WATCH ON THEDICTATOR HE ARMY AN INFORMS
ON THEIR MOVEMENT.
>> Stephen: CLOONEY, NOBODYCARES IF YOU TIE YOUR KITE
AND FLY IT OVER AFRICA.
LOOK F ARE YOU SERIOUS, IFYOU REALLY WANT ANYONE TO
PAY ATTENTION TO AL-BASHIR,PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR
MOUTH IS AND START DATINGHIM.
OKAY?
MAKE HIM YOUR GO-TO ARMCANDY ON THE RED CARPET.
YOU DO THIS, AND IT WON'T BELONG UNTIL THE PRESS GIVES
YOU GUYS A CUTE COUPLE'SNAME LIKE GEOMAR AL
BALLOONY.
IN FACT, I SAY WE SHOULDMAKE ALL OF OUR WANTED
CRIMINALS A-LIST LENS MEAT.
I MEAN IT TOOK THE CIA OVERA DECADE TO FIND BIN
LADENMENT BUT IF THE TMZ HADBEEN ON THE CASE THEY WOULD
HAVE FOUND HIM IN FOUR DAYSAND GOTTEN AN UPROBE SHOT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
