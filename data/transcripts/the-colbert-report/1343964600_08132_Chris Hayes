[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, CHRIS.
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.
YOU ARE NOT WEARING A TIE.
>> I'M NOT.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
DID YOU AT LEAST WEAR UNDERWEAR?
>> I DID WEAR UNDERWEAR I'M TERRIBLE AT TYING TIES.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY?
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
>> I'M 33.
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT IN LIFE I GAVE UP
ON AND DECIDED TO COMMIT MYSELF TO OTHER THINGS.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE A NEWSMAN NOW IT'S CALLED GRAVITAS.
>> WE ENGINEERED THE SHOW AROUND THE FACT THAT I CAN'T TIE A TIE.
>> STEPHEN: SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PROGRAM.
YOU ARE EDITOR AT LARGE IN THE NATION MAGAZINE.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU GOT THE SHOW UP WITH CHRIS HAYES BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED TWILIGHT OF THE ELITES, AMERICA AFTER MERIT OK CRASSY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN OF THE TWILIGHT OF THE ELITES, SPEAKING TO YOU AS AN ELITE.
>> TWILIGHT IS ASPIRATIONAL TITLE.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY YOU?  WANT IT TO BE OVER FOR GUYS LIKE ME?
>> MORE OR LESS.
>> STEPHEN: WOW, WOW.
>> I THINK GUYS LIKE YOU AND I SAW THIS WITH A DUE DEFERENCE AND RESPECT.
>> STEPHEN: CAN I TELL.
>> HAVE HAD A PRETTY POOR RECORD OVER THIS DECADE.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I HAVE AN iPAD.
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.
>> THEY ARE ON ONE SIDE OF LEDGER BUT WHEN YOU BALANCE THAT AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR, CREAN YARK
LARGER FINANCIAL CRISIS, $8 TRILLION IN A HOUSING BUBBLE THAT WENT UP.
>> STEPHEN: IT WAS NOT THE ELITE.
IT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD HOUSES FOOLING THE BANKS INTO GIVING THEM LOANS.
>> YOU KNOW FROM THE HISTORY.
>> STEPHEN: READ THE HISTORY BOOKS.
>> FROM THE HISTORY, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LENDING MONEY A LONG TIME.
IN THE HISTORY AFTER THIS GOING BACK TO THE GREEKS IT'S THE LENDER WHO MAKES THE JUDGMENT
ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE IS CREDIT WORTHY.
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
>> STEPHEN: NO, NO, NO BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT FORCED THE BANKS TO DO IT.
WHAT DO YOU FEE FINE AS AN ELITE.
YOU ARE A MEDIA ELITE.
IS THIS A CRY FOR HELP?
>>
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S LARGELY THERAPY HISTORICALLY WHAT THE BORED IS MEANT AND A POWERFUL WAY OF
EXPLANNING THE WORD SAY RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO EXERT A DISPROPORTIONATE
INFLUENCE OVER THE SOCIETY'S DIRECTION.
>> STEPHEN: YOU MEAN THE PEOPLE WHO EARNED THEIR PLACE IN THE MERITOCRACY.
YOU MAY WANT TO WRITE THIS DOWN,
EARNED THE PLACE?
>> I MEAN THE PEOPLE WHO TELL THEMSELVES THEY EARNED THE PLACE.
>> STEPHEN: NOBODY GAVE ME ANYTHING OTHER THAN MY PARENTS WHO GAVE MET FORTUNE I USED TO
GO TO SCHOOL.
>> THAT'S THE BOOK'S ARGUMENT IN ONE SENTENCE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT YOU SHE HAD IT.
I HEAR IT'S WONDERFUL.
BUT, OKAY, SO -- HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE -- YOU ARE EVEN AGAINST INTELLECTUAL ELITES.
DON'T PREPARE FOR THE S.A.T.S.
DOWN THE TAKE THE KAPLAN PREP TEST IT'S CHEATING, WHAT?
>> IT'S A SMALL BUT ACUTE EXAMPLE IN THE WAYS WE TELL OURSELVES WE'RE PROBHEEGHT WE
CALL EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT OUTCOME.
PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF CAN GET AS RICH AS THEY CAN GET IN AMERICA IT'S A GREAT THING.
>> STEPHEN: IS IT NOT A GOOD THING?
>> IT'S A COMPLICATED THING.
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW SUCCESSFUL I SHOULD BE.
>> I THINK THAT THE LEVEL OF INEQUALITY WE'VE SEEN PRODUCES ELITES THAT CANNOT HELP BUT FAIL.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE FAIL.
>> LOOK AROUND YOU, SEE STEPHEN.
>> STEPHEN: I HAVE A TELEVISION SHOW.
PEOPLE CHANT MY NAME!
I'VE GOT CHRIS HAYES AS MY GUEST AM I FAILING IN SOME WAY?
>> YOU ARE SUCCEEDED BUT IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE AND TAKE THE SUBWAY TEN OR 15 STOPS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION,
ANGER AND MISERY IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW BROUGHT ABOUT BY A COLOSSAL AND CATASTROPHIC
FAILURE BY THE PILLAR INSTITUTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.
THE COSTS OF IT ARE NOT BORNE BY THE STEPHEN COLBERT'S EVEN IF
IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S OF THE WORLD THAT BROUGHT IT ABOUT THEY
ARE BORNE BY THE PEOPLE 15 STOPS AWAY FROM HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU ARE SOMETHING OF A POPULOUS HERE.
>> SOMETHING OF THAT, YES.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE SAY BEGUN,
YOU KNOW, THE BOOK OFFERS A FEW -- A DOWN TO EARTH SOLUTIONS FOR ELITISTS LIKE ME WHO
FETISHIZE, YOU KNOW, BIG THOUGHTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
YOU SUGGEST, AND I QUOTE "BUILDING A TRANSID LOGICAL COALITION THAT COULD ACTUALLY
DISLODGE THE POWER OF THE POST MERITOCRATIC ELITE -- IT DOESN'T
GET ANY MORE POPULOUS THAN THAT.
I WISH WOODY GUTHRIE WERE ALIVE TO SET THAT TO MUSE IC.
GOOD LUCK WITH THE REVOLUTION COMRADE HAYES.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
>> STEPHEN: THE BOOK IS "THE TWILIGHT OF ELITES." I THINK IT HAS
