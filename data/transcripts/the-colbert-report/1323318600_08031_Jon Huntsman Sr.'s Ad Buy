EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
FOLKS, THE CAIN TRAIN HAS BEEN
PERMANENTLY DERAILED AND NOW THE
QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MINDS IS
WHO IS NEXT.
AND WHAT FORM OF TRANSPORTATION
WILL THEY COMPARE THEMSELVES TO?
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHETHER
SANTORUM OR PERRY WILL BE THE
FIRST TO CLAIM THE RICKSHAW.
YOU SEE, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK
OUT THERE ABOUT JON HUNTSMAN NOW
THANKS TO A RECENT HUGE AD BUY
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
>> HIM.
>> THE WORLD IS LITERALLY
COLLAPSING AND NO ONE HAS SHOWN
UP WE CAN TRUST AS A
CONSERVATIVE.
>> WHO ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE TO
WIN.
>> OUR GOVERNMENT'S FLABBY,
BLOATED AND WEAK.
WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD OF THIS
GUY?
>> Stephen: GOOD QUESTION,
CRANKY OLD MAN IN CLOSE-UP,
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS
GUY BECAUSE THE AD YOU'RE IN WAS
ONLY RECENTLY FINANCED BY A BIG
CORPORATE SUGAR DADDY,
LITERALLY.
>> JON HUNTSMAN GETTING A LITTLE
MONETARY HELP FROM HIS DAD.
>> SOME OF THE MONEY THAT'S
GOING TOWARDS THESE ADS CAME
FROM JON HUNTSMAN'S FATHER.
>> HIS FATHER HAS DEEP FATHERS
AND IS FUNDING THE SUPER PAC.
>> Stephen: AND DADDY CAN
AFFORD THAT SUGAR.
JON HUNTSMAN SENIOR IS THE
BILLIONAIRE FOUNDER OF HUNTSMAN
CHEMICAL AND THE HUNTSMAN
CONTAINER CORPORATION, WHICH
INVENTED THE STYROFOAM FAST FOOD
BURGER CLAM ALCOHOL AS WELL AS
THE STYROFOAM IN MANY FAST FOOD
BURGERS.
NOW, FOLKS, I'VE GOT MY OWN
SUPER PAC, AND I KNOW CANDIDATES
AND SUPER PACS CANNOT LEGALLY
COORDINATE THEIR MESSAGING,
LUCKILY JON HUNTSMAN AND HIS DAD
ARE NOT COORDINATING.
>> WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THOSE
THINGS.
WE CAN'T.
>> Stephen: SEE.
THEY KNOW THE RULES.
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
THEY RESTRICT THEIR DINNER TABLE
CONVERSATION TO THINGS LIKE,
"HEY, DAD, DO YOU WANT SOME MORE
CHICKEN AND DID YOU KNOW THAT
I'M CAMPAIGNING ONLY IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE WHERE MASSIVE AD BUY
WOULD REALLY BE GREAT.
PASS THE PEAS AND THE MONEY."
PLUS HUNTSMAN HAZLETT IT BE
KNOWN THAT HE DOES NOT WANT TO
BE SEEN AS HAVING AN ELECTION
DELIVERED TO HIM BY HIS FATHER'S
WEALTH.
HE WANTS TO EARN IT, JUST LIKE
HE EARNED HIS POSITION OF
CHAIRMAN OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION
WORKING HIS WAY UP FROM HIS
FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE, VICE
PRESIDENT.
PERSONALLY, I THINK JON HUNTSMAN
SHOULD BE GRATEFUL HIS DAD IS
GOING THROUGH A SUPER PAC
BECAUSE A PARENT WITH UNLIMITED
CASH COULD MAKE COMMERCIALS THAT
MIGHT BE EMBARRASSING, LIKE
THIS.
>> AMERICA'S BROKEN.
WE NEED A STRONG LEADER LIKE JON
HUNTSMAN WITH A PROVEN RECORD OF
ACHIEVEMENT, FOR INSTANCE, AT
JUST 18 MONTHS, JOHNNY STARTED
USING THE POTTY ALL BY HIMSELF.
HE'S A VISIONARY WHO COULD READ
BEFORE HE ENTERED PRESCHOOL.
IT'S NOT EVERY THREE-YEAR-OLD
THAT KNOWS THE WORD.
>> DON'T FORGET THE CHRISTMAS
PAGEANT.
>> KAREN, I'M TALKING.
>> HE WAS A LITTLE WISEMAN.
PEOPLE FORGOT ALL THE BABY
JESUS.
>> SCIENCE FAIR SILVER MEDALIST.
>> SO HANDSOME.
[LAUGHTER]
JON HUNTSMAN JUNIOR, THE NICEST
BOY.
>> HE BREAST-FED
