TALKING ABOUT TODAY.
IN A ROSE GARDEN CEREMONY,
PRESIDENT OBAMA DUMPED GENERAL
STANLEY McCHRYSTAL AS
COMMANDER IN AFGHANISTAN AND
REPLACED HIM WITH GENERAL DAVID
PETRAEUS.
NOW, McCHRYSTAL GOT THE AXE
AFTER HE RIPPED THE
ADMINISTRATION IN "ROLLING
STONE" MAGAZINE, EVEN SAYING
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS
UNIMPRESSIVE AND LOOKED
INTIMIDATED IN THE PRESENCE OF
MILITARY OFFICERS, AND YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
JOE BIDEN IN "PEOPLE."
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, THIS MIGHT SHOCK YOU,
FOLKS, BUT I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH
THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO
REPLACE McCHRYSTAL.
AFTER ALL, UNDER GENERAL
PETRAEUS' COMMAND, WE HAVE
ALREADY DEFEATED ONE HOSTILE
MUSLIM NATION.
I'M REFERRING, OF COURSE TO,
ALGERIA.
GOOOOOOOOOAL!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> AUDIENCE: U-S-A, U-S-A,
U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A!
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, ALGERIA
IS A LONGTIME DEADLY ENEMY.
I BELIEVE ALGERIA IS WHERE
ALLERGIES COME FROM.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT TO MENTION ALGEBRA AND AL
JARREAU.
AND WE WON THIS GAME IN STYLE
WITH A GAME-SAVING EXTRA-TIME
GOAL BY LANDON DONOVAN.
MY MISTAKE.
PRESIDENT DONOVAN.
2012.
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST.
GET HAIRPIECE.
NOW, NATION, I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT I
AM A LONGTIME FAN OF SOCCER.
JIMMY, SHOW THEM HOW MUCH I'VE
ALWAYS LOVED SOCCER.
SOCCER, THE SPORT FOR FOURTH
GRADERS THAT FOREIGN PEOPLE TAKE
SERIOUSLY.
IN FACT, IN HONOR OF OUR
VICTORY, FOR THE REST OF THE
SHOW, I AM PLAYING BY SOCCER
RULES.
NO HANDS FOR ANYTHING.
I THINK I'LL HAVE A DRINK OF
WATER.
[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT THIRSTY
RIGHT NOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
