FOLKS, FOLKS, MY VACATIONWAS JUST FANTASTIC
AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGSABOUT BEING ON VACATION IS
SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THEWIFE AND KIDS, I ESPECIALLY
LOOK FORWARD TO MY FAMILY'SWEEKLY GAME NIGHT.
BECAUSE NOTHING IS BETTERTHAN A ROUND OF CLUE TO TAKE
EVERYONE'S MINE OFFTHAT-- TAKE EVERYONE'S MIND
OFF THAT CANDLESTICK MURDERTHAT HAPPENED IN OUR
CONSERVATORY.
BUT I RECENTLY LEARNEDSOMETHING DISTURBING ABOUT
ONE OF OUR CLASSIC GAMES.
>> FOR ITS FIRST TIME INNEARLY A DECADE 5,000 NEW
WORDS WILL APPEAR IN THE NEWEDITION OF SCRABBLE'S
OFFICIAL DICTIONARYINCLUDING WORDS LIKE HASHTAG,
SELFIE, BUZZKILL AND BROMANCE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, HASBRO HASADDED NEW SCRABBLE WORDS AND I'M
SORRY, BUT THIS ENDS OURHASBRO-MANCE BECAUSE THIS
ASSAULT ON OUR TRADITIONALSCRABBLE VOCABULARY MAKES ME
MAD, NO, CHANGE THAT TO VEXED(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THIS IS NOTHING BUT ACHEAP ATTEMPT BY THE LEXI
CONARTISTS OVER AT HASBRO TOPANDER TO THE YOUNG LINGS

YOUNGER PEOPLE.

THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
THE NEW WORDS CAPTURE THEWAY YOUNG PEOPLE SPEAK, AT
