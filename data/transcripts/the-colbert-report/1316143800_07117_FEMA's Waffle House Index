( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND
ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION
RECENTLY CONFIRMED THIS HAS BEEN
THE WORST YEAR FOR DISASTERS IN
U.S. HISTORY.
FROM THE TORNADOES IN MISSOURI
TO THE HURRICANE IRENE, TO NEWT
GINGRICH'S PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN-- LUCKILY HIS STAFF
EVACUATED MONTHS AGO
( LAUGHTER )
SO IT HAS BEEN A BIT OF A BUSY
YEAR FOR FEMA.
NOW, FOLKS, YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER
BEEN A FAN OF FEDERAL EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT.
WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL ME
MY HOUSE HAS BECOME
UNINHABITABLE.
THE RACCOONS HAVE SETTLED IN
JUST FINE
( LAUGHTER )
BUT FEMA HAS FINALLY DONE
SOMETHING RIGHT.
JIM.
>> TIME FEMA REVEALED THEY
PARTIALLY GAUGE THE SEVERITY OF
A DISASTER BASED ON THE
CONDITION OF WAFFLE HOUSE
RESTAURANT.
THE AGENCY USES THE WAFFLE HOUSE
INDEX.
THE CHAIN PRIDES ITSELF ON
OPERATING DURING SEVERE NATURAL
DISASTERS.
FEMA SAYS IF A WAFFLE HOUSE
LOCATION IS CLOSED THEY KNOW THE
AREA NEEDS AID.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  YES, THE WAFFLE
HOUSE INDEX.
BECAUSE IN AMERICA, IT IS ONLY A
DISASTER ONCE IT DISRUPTS OUR
SUPPLY OF CHICKEN-FRIED MEATS
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, FEMA RANKS AN AREA'S
POST-DISASTER CONDITION BASED ON
A THREE-COLOR SCALE.
GREEN MEANS THE WAFFLE HOUSE IS
OPEN AND SERVING A FULL MENU,
OKAY, LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.
OKAY?
THE WAFFLE HOUSE BEING ABLE TO
SERVE THEIR FULL MENU IS A SIGN
THAT DAMAGE IN THE AREA IS
LIMITED, AND THAT LIPITOR IS
PREVENT WILL-- PLENTIFUL.
YELLOW MEANS THE WAFFLE HOUSE IS
OFFERING ONLY A LIMITED MENU, OR
THIS, THEIR PHOTO MENU,
INDICATING AREA RESIDENTS
PROBABLY HAVE LIMITED POWER AND
FOOD, OR ARE TOO DRUNK TO READ.
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, NOW, RED IS A SIGN OF
SEVERE DAMAGE.
WAFFLE HOUSE IS CLOSED OR IN THE
EXAMPLE OF POST-KATRINA
MISSISSIPPI, REDUCED TO NOTHING
BUT A SLAB.
BY THE WAY, NOTHING BUT A SLAB
IS HOW YOU ORDER THE
CHICKEN-FRIED MEAT.
FOLKS, IT IS NO ACCIDENT THE
WAFFLE HOUSE HAS BECOME FEMA'S
SYRUP-SMOTHERED CANARY IN A COAL
MINE.
ALSO, AVAILABLE ON THE MENU.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, WHEN
RESTAURANTS THAT REOPENED
QUICKLY WERE SWAMPED WITH
CUSTOMERS, WAFFLE HOUSE
EXECUTIVES DEVELOPED A MANUAL
FOR OPENING AFTER A DISASTER,
BULKED UP ON PORTABLE
GENERATORES, BOUGHT A MOBILE
COMMAND CENTER AND GAVE
EMPLOYEES KEY FOBS WITH
EMOTIONAL CONTACTS.
NOT TO MENTION THEIR STRATEGY OF
SLOWLY TURNING THEIR CUSTOMERS
INTO FLOTATION DEVICES.
BU, FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I THINK
IT'S A GOOD MOVE BY FEMA, I SAY
WE CUT OUT THE GOVERNMENT MIDDLE
MAN AND PUT THE WAFFLE HOUSE IN
CHARGE OF ALL OUR EMERGENCY
OPERATIONS
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DRUNK AT
3 A.M.
( LAUGHTER )
FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW IN A
FLOOD ZONE, SHORT STACKS ALSO
DOUBLE AS SANDBAGS
( LAUGHTER )
AND SOMEHOW, 60,000 OF THEM
STILL COST JUST $2.99 WITH YOUR
CHOICE OF CHICKEN-FRIED MEAT.
I SAY BETTER TO GO WITH A
SOVEREIGN AMERICAN WAFFLE HOUSE
THAN THE U.N.'S HUMANITARIAN
BREAKFAST RESPONSE-- THE
INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ).
THEY WILL JUST PASS A USELESS,
NONBINDING RESOLUTION DECLARING
DISASTER ROOTY TOOTY, NOT SO
FRESH AND FRUITY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
