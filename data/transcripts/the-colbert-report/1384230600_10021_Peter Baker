ADMINISTRATION AND THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION?
BECAUSE YOU GUYS WERE SO TOUGHON BUSH AND SO IN LOVE WITH
OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER)>> RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMAWOULD SAY.
THEY DON'T SEEM TO THINK WE'REVERY EASY ON HIM.
BUT, LOOK, WE COVER ALLPRESIDENT IT IS SAME WAY.
WE TRY TO BE TOUGH BUT FAIR ANDTRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

FEED THE ARGUMENT.

NEUTRAL ABOUT SO IT'S ACHALLENGE.

MEDICARE PART "D" THAT PAYS FORPRESCRIPTION DRUG CARE.
OBVIOUSLY IRAQ SUCKS A LOT OFTHE OPTION OUT OF THE ROOM.
>> Stephen: I'M GLAD YOUFINISHED THAT SENTENCE.
(LAUGHTER)WAS HE IN CHARGE?
BECAUSE THE LINE ON THESE TWOWAS THAT CHENEY WAS CALLING THE
SHOTS AND THAT MY MAN BUSH WASJUST A PUPPET.
>> I THINK THAT'S THE SURPRISINGTHING YOU LEARN FROM THIS BOOK
IS IN FACT THE RELATIONSHIP ISMUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
CHENEY WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL INTHE BEGINNING BUT AS THE TERM
WENT ON THE TWO OF THEM DIVERGEDAND WENT IN DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS.
BY THE END THEY WERE ON OPPOSITESIDES OF MOST OF THE ISSUES THEN
THEY HAD A BIG FIGHT AT THE END.
>> Stephen: THEY GREW APART?
>> THEY WERE ONS ON IT IS SIDESOF IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA,
RUSSIA, CLIMATE CHANGE, GUNRIGHTS, THE AUTO BAILOUT.

SO BUSH WAS ON ONE SIDE ANDCHENEY WAS ON THE OTHER ABOUT
CLIMATE CHANGE AND GUN RIGHTSAND -- WHEN DID BUSH -- WAS BUSH
GAGGED?
WHY --(LAUGHTER).
WHY DID I NOT HEAR ANYTHING THATI DIDN'T LIKE FROM BUSH.

WHERE WAS THE GUN CONTROL BUSHINSTITUTED?
>> HE DIDN'T DO GUN CONTROL BUTON THE SECOND AMENDMENT CASE
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT THEADMINISTRATION PUT IN A MIDDLE
OF-THE-ROAD BRIEF THAT CHENEYDIDN'T LIKE.
HE SIGNED ON TO A DIFFERENTBRIEF SAYING THE SECOND
AMENDMENT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS TOGUNS AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF JOSH
BOLTON WENT TO CHENEY'S CHIEF OFSTAFF AND SAID "YOU CAN'T DO
THIS ANYMORE."
HE SAID, LOOK, KHAEUBNY IS THEPRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND HE
SAID IF YOU DO THAT, TAKE YOURSTUFF AND GO UP TO THE HILL AND
WORK OUT OF THERE INSTEAD OF THEWHITE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: IS THAT WHATHAPPENED?
>> HE DID NOT.
IN THE END HE LET HIM STAY.
>> Stephen: THERE'S THE DOOR,DON'T LET IT HIT YOU WHERE THE
GOOD LORD SPLIT YOU."
(LAUGHTER)WERE THEY EVER FRIENDS?
>> THEY WERE NEVER FRIENDS.
I ASKED JIMMY ABOUT IT.
HE SAID THEY WERE NEVER BUDDIES.

THAT'S LIKE FINDING OUT BATMANAND ROBIN WEREN'T GAY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)DID THEY ACTUALLY FIGHT ABOUT
ANYTHING?
>> THEY DID BY THE END.
ESPECIALLY OVER SCOOTER LIBBY.
SCOOTER LIBBY WAS CHIEF OF STAFFTO THE VICE PRESIDENT.
HE GOT CONVICTED IN THE C.I.A.
LEAK CASE.
CHENEY THOUGHT IT WAS A BOGUSPROSECUTION.
BUSH SAID -- CHENEY SAID "ITHINK YOU SHOULD PARDON HIM."
BUSH SAID NO.
CHENEY SAID "YOU'RE LEAVING AGOOD MAN ON THE FIELD OF
BATTLE."
ON THE INAUGURATION DAY IT'SJUST BUSH AND OBAMA IN THE CAR
HE SAYS "WHATEVER YOU DO, SET APARDON POLICY EARLY AND STICK TO
IT.
LEARN HOW TO SAY NO TO YOUR VICEPRESIDENT."

PEOPLE IN THE FACE.

TWO OF THEM WHEN CHENEY SHOT AMAN IN THE FACE.
(LAUGHTER)IT WAS A MISTAKE.
WHY WAS THAT A PROBLEM FOR THEPRESIDENT?
>> THEY WERE UPSET THAT THE VICEPRESIDENT DIDN'T PUT THIS OUT AT
FIRST, DIDN'T DISCLOSE IT.
LAURA BUSH HEARD ABOUT IT -->> THE VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AND GO"SURPRISE, I SHOT SOMEONE IN THE
FACE?">> EVEN LAURA BUSH WAS UPSET.
SHE HEARD ABOUT IT FROM HERSECRET SERVICE AGENTS.
CAUSED MORE FRICTIONS BETWEENTWO SIDES.
>> Stephen: DID CHENEY EVER --CHENEY NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR
SHOOTING EVERYONE IN THE FACE.
HE DID.
HE WENT ON BRIT HUME,EVENTUALLY.
THE PRESIDENT -->> Stephen: HE SHOT THE
PRESIDENT IN THE FACE.
>> HE DID NOT SHOOT THEPRESIDENT IN THE FACE.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT THEOTHER GUY APOLOGIZED FOR GETTING
HIS FACE IN THE WAY OF CHENEY'SGUN.
