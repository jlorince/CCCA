( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )LUCKILY, FOLKS, THE FAMILY
RESEARCH COUNCIL AND THENATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR
MARRIAGE HAVE STOOD UP WITH ANOPENLY ANTIGAY LETTER SAYING WE
CANNOT IN GOOD CONGRESS URGE OURMEMBERS AND FELLOW CITIZENS TO
SUPPORT CANDIDATES LIKE DEMAIO.
THEY WILL SECURE A PLATFORM INTHE MEDIA TO ADVANCE THEIR
FLAWED IDOL AND SERVE ASTERRIBLE ROLE MODELS FOR YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO WILL INEVITABLY BEENCOURAGED TO EMULATE THEM.
( LAUGHTER )OH, YES, IT'S INEVITABLE.
TEENAGERS DEFINITELY COPYWHATEVER CONGRESS DOES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S WHY--
( APPLAUSE )YOU KNOW-- THAT'S WHY ALL--
THAT'S WHY THE COOL KIDS AREALWAYS HANGING OUT AT THE MALL
REFUSING TO PASS AN AGRICULTUREBILL.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND BOEHNER HERE IS BETRAYINGCORE CONSERVATIVE BELIEFS FOR
THE WORST POSSIBLE REASON-- IT'SWHAT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS
WANT.
>> REPUBLICANS ARE GRAPPLINGWITH THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT
THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY YOUNGPEOPLE, ARE MOVING TOWARD GAY
MARRIAGE ACCEPTANCE, EVENSUPPORT.
61%-- THAT'S MORE THAN THREE INFIVE-- OF REPUBLICANS AGED 18-29
FAVOR ALLOWING GAYS AND LESBIANSTO MARRY LEGALLY.
>> STEPHEN: REALLY!
THREE IN FIVE?
THAT IS SHOCKING.
THAT THERE ARE STILL FIVEREPUBLICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF
18 AND 29.
( LAUGHTER )I JUST-- WHERE ARE THEY?
I DON'T--( APPLAUSE )
I GOTTA GO TO DIFFERENT CLUBS. IFEEL LIKE
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH WHOOPPOSES MAN-MAN MARRIAGE.

( LAUGHTER )BESIDE, THE SANCTITY
OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS NOTSOME FAD, GEORGE.
YOU CAN'T PRAY AWAY YOUR GAY.
WELL, YOU CAN'T GAY AWAY MYPRAY.
FOR CHRISTIANS LIKE ME THIS IS ACIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE IN I DON'T
LIKE GAY PEOPLE GETTING CIVILRIGHTS.
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHOFEELS THAT WAY, NATIONAL REVIEW
WRITER AND SKINNY GEORGE LUCASMATTHEW J. FRANCK, RECENTLY
WRITE AGO HE WROTE THAT THECOURT'S NONDECISION IS A
SLOW-MOTION DRED SCOTT FOR THE21ST CENTURY.
WHICH IS EERILY SIMILAR TO MYSCIENCE FICTION SERIES "SLOW
MAGAZINE DRED SCOTT IN THE 21ST CENTURY."
( APPLAUSE )DRED SCOTT, OF COURSE, WAS THE
ENSLAVED PLAINTIFF IN THESUPREME COURT CASE THAT FOUND
AFRICAN AMERICAN HAD NO RIGHTS,WHICH THE WHITE MAN WAS BOUND TO
RESPECT, WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY,IS ALSO THE CITY MOTTO OF
FERGUSON, MISSOURI.
JUST LIKE THE DRED SCOTTDECISION, THESE GAY MARRIAGE
CASES WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO ACIVIL WAR.
AND I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TOPREDICT WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO
REMEMBER THAT WAR IN MY NEWLANDMARK DOCUMENTARY, "THE GAY
CIVIL WAR."
JIMMY.
( APPLAUSE )JIMMY, LET'S--
( CHEERS )JIMMY, LET'S BREAK THEIR HEARTS.
MY DEAREST SARA, INDICATIONS ARETHAT WE WILL SOON MOVE OUT
AGAINST OUR VAST AND FABULOUSENEMY.
I DO BELIEVE IN OUR CAUSE.
AS JEFFERSON HIMSELF SAID, "IT'SADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND
STEVE.
AND I LOVES ME THE BROWN SUGAR.
THOUGH DEATH MAY COME, I'MWILLING TO LAY DOWN MY LIFE TO
MAKE SURE LESBIANS CAN'TREGISTER AT BED, BATH,  &
BEYOND."
SARAH, MY LOVE FOR YOU ISDEPTHLESS.
IT BINDS ME WITH MIGHTY CABLESTHAT NOTHING BUT OMNIPOTENCE
COULD BREAK-- OR IF TWO DUDESGET MARRIED.
IN THAT CASE, I AM OUT OF HERE,BECAUSE ICK.
AND YES, AND YES--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND, YES, WE ANTIGAY MARRIAGECRUSADERS MAY BE FIGHTING A LOST
CAUSE BUT WE STILL HAVE OURHONOR.
AND 20 YEARS FROM NOW, WE'LLSWEAR WE FOUGHT ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
