( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TOM, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
ALL RIGHT, IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARSSINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE.
JUST TO REMIND THE PEOPLE WHOYOU ARE.
YOU'RE A THREE TIME PULITZERAWARD WINNING COLUMNIST FOR THE
NEW YORK TIMES, YOU'VE GOT SIXBEST-SELLING BOOKS
NOW YOU'RE IN A SHOWTIMEDOCUMENTARY CALLED "YEARS OF
LIVING DANGEROUSLY."
MONDAYS AT 8:00 P.M.
GLOBAL WARMING, THAT BIG A DEAL?
IS IT THAT BIG A DEAL?
IS IT HAS A SCARY NAME, GLOBALWARMING.
HOW MUCH OF IT IS HYPE?
>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THESCIENCE WHAT, THEY'LL TELL YOU
IS 97% OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTSBELIEVE THAT THE PLANET IS
WARMING BECAUSE OF HUMAN-INDUCEDCLIMATE CHANGE.
ICE IS MELTING, SEA LEVELRISING.
YOUR BEACH HOME COULD BEIMPERILED, AS A RESULT, AMONG
MANY OTHER THINGS.
>> Stephen:  WHAT!
I HAVE SUNK SOME CASH INTO MYBEACH HOUSE, MY FRIEND.
IT'S BEACHFRONT.
>> IS IT IN OHIO?
BECAUSE THAT COULD BE THEBEACHFRONT YOU WANT IN THE
FUTURE.
>> Stephen:  WOW.
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION.
YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION.
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT GLOBALWARMING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE SAY, OKAY, YEAH, IT'SCOMING.
BUT HAS IT ALREADY COME?
IS IT TOO LATE?
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOWLAST NIGHT THAT SCIENTISTS ARE
NOW SAYING-- TWO DIFFERENTPAPERS SAYING THE GLACIERS IN
ANTARCTICA, THEY'RE JUST SLIDINGINTO THE SEA, AND THERE'S
NOTHING TO BE DONE.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE CARBON OF1700 AND IT'S STILL GOING TO
HAPPEN.
SHOULDN'T WE JUST POP THECHAMPAGNE AND KIND OF LIKE "LAST
NIGHT ON EARTH" KIND OF SEX?
JUST GIVE UP?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )JUST GIVE UP AND BACCHANIALIA,
MASK OF THE RED DEATH, ANDWAIT FOR DEATH.
>> THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THISCLIMATE SERIES IS IF YOU DO
PRESENT IT THAT WAY, PEOPLE SAYLET'S PARTY.
>> Stephen:  RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE USE?
>> AND IF YOU DON'T-- IF YOU TRYTO MOBILIZE THEM-- I THINK THE
WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT ISTHIS-- OUR CHALLENGE NOW IS TO
MANAGE THE UNAVOIDABLE AND AVOIDTHE UNMANAGEABLE. THERE'S STILL
STUFF WE CAN REALLY MITIGATE ANDLESSEN IF WE ACT NOW BUT
WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO ISUNLEASH IS TRULY UNMANAGEABLE
CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THAT'S THECHALLENGE.
THERE IS A CLIMATE SCIENTISTDANA MEADOWS WHO SAID EVERYTHING
WE DO, WE HAVE TO APPROACH AS WEHAVE EXACTLY ENOUGH TIME
STARTING NOW.
AND THAT'S I THINK HAS TO BEYOUR APPROACH.
WE HAVE-->> Stephen:  NOW JUST PASSED.
NOW THERE'S NO TIME.
>> NOW WE HAVE EXACTLY ENOUGHTIME STARTING NOW.
>> Stephen:  THEN BEFORE YOUWERE LYING.
BEFORE YOU WERE LYING.
WHICH IS IT, TOM?
>> IT'S THE ONLY APPROACH YOUCAN TAKE.
>> Stephen:  ONE OF THE THINGSYOU TALK ABOUT, YOU GO TO SYRIA
AT ONE POINT IN THIS.
WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU.
EXPLAIN-- LET'S WATCH THE CLIPAND THEN EXPLAIN TO US WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE.
>> THEY TOOK YOU AWAY FOR TWOMONTHS.
>> Stephen:  SO WHAT DOESGLOBAL WARMING HAVING TO DO WITH
THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA?
>> SO SYRIA IN THE FOUR YEARSLEADING UP TO THE OUTBREAK OF
THE CIVIL WAR THERE, STEPHEN,HAD THE WORST DROUGHT IN ITS
MODERN HISTORY.
AND THE WOMAN WE WEREINTERVIEWING IS FROM NORTHERN
SYRIA AND THAT IS IS HER SON,WHO IS A FIGHTER.
SHE WAS BASICALLY EXPLAININGTHEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS.
THEIR FARM WAS WIPED OUT.
ABOUT 1 MILLION FARMERS ANDHERDERS LEFT THE COUNTRYSIDE,
FLOCKED TO THE CITIES BECAUSE OFTHE DROUGHT.
THE GOVERNMENT DID NOTHING FORTHEM.
SO WHEN THE REVOLUTION STARTED--FOR POLITICAL REASONS, IT WASN'T
CAUSED BY THE DROUGHT-- WHEN ITSTARTED YOU HAD A MILLION--
NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE,HERDERS AND FARMERS-- WHO
COULDN'T WAIT TO JOIN THEREVOLUTION.
>> Stephen:  THEY HAD NO OTHEROPTIONS AT THAT POINT.
>> AND THE GOVERNMENT HAD DONENOTHING FOR THEM.
SYRIA COULDN'T HANDLE THEDROUGHT WHEN THEY HAD A
GOVERNMENT.
NOW THEY HAVE NO GOVERNMENT.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE NEXT ONECOMES ALONG?
AND THE SCIENTISTS SAY IT WILLGET HOTTER.
>> Stephen:  YESTERDAY, INCALIFORNIA, THIS WAS-- THERE WAS
A FIRE TORNADO.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen:  IN CALIFORNIA.
THAT STATE-- THERE ARE FIRES ALLUP AND DOWN THAT STATE.
IS THIS GLOBAL WARMING I'MLOOKING AT?
IS THIS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT.
>> WHAT I PREFER TO CALL IT ISGLOBAL WEIRDING.
THE HOTS GET HOTTER.
THE WETS GET WETTER.
THE DRIES GET DRIER.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME REALLYWEIRD STUFF.
>> Stephen:  IT'S MONDAYS AT8:00 P.M.
I WANT TO WATCH IT.
I ONLY HAVE A DIESEL-POWEREDTELEVISION.

IT?
