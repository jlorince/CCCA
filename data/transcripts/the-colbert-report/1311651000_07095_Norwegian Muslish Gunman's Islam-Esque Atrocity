[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, TODAY HERE AND ALL
AROUND THE WORLD, ALL OUR
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TONIGHT ARE
WITH THE PEOPLE OF NORWAY, WHO
SUFFERED AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY
ON FRIDAY.
THE KILLER HAS BEEN CAUGHT, HAS
CONFESSED AND NO PUNISHMENT IS
TOO HARSH FOR HIM.
THE HORROR HE HAS WREAKED IS
INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND WORDS FAIL
THE CIVILIZED.
BUT SOMETIMES IN A CRISIS, TRUE
HEROES EMERGE, LIKE THE BRAVE
MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA'S
NEWSROOMS, WHO IDENTIFIED THE
CULPRIT LONG BEFORE THE
NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES DID.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
BLAST?
WELL, NORWAY HAS BEEN GRAPPLING
WITH SOME HOME-GROWN TERROR
PLOTS LINKED TO AL QAEDA.
>> WITHOUT ALL THE FACTS IN, THE
FINGER OF SUSPICION WOULD
SUGGEST THAT THIS IS PROBABLY
MIDDLE EASTERN IN ITS ORIGIN.
>> TWO DEADLY TERROR ATTACKS IN
NORWAY IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE
WORK ONCE AGAIN OF MUSLIM
EXTREMEISTS.
>> Stephen: AND THE PRINT
MEDIA DID ITS PART, LIKE
JENNIFER RUBIN WHO WROTE, "THERE
IS A SPECIFIC JIHADIST
CONNECTION HERE.
THIS IS A SOBERING REMINDER FOR
THOSE WHO THINK IT'S TOO
EXPENSIVE TO WAGE WAR AGAINST
JIHADISTS."
AND THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
SAID, AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI HAS
REPEATEDLY SINGLED OUT NORWAY.
AND YOU KNOW THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL" IS ACCURATE BECAUSE AS
A MURDOCH PAPER, THEY'VE GOT
PROVEN WAYS TO GET INSIDE
INFORMATION.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, IT TURNS OUT ON SATURDAY WE
FOUND OUT THE ATTACKS WERE
CARRIED OUT BY ANDERS BREIVIK, A
NATIVE NORWEGIAN CHRISTIAN WITH
A 1500 PAGE MANIFESTO RAILING
AGAINST THE MUSLIMIZATION OF
EUROPE.
SOME SAY THESE FALSE REPORTS OF
MUSLIM INVOLVEMENT WERE A
WIDESPREAD FAILURE OF THE MEDIA,
BUT I SAY BY GOING WITH THEIR
GUT, THESE JOURNALISTS WERE ABLE
TO GET THE STORY THEY WANTED AND
SCOOP REALITY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND EVEN IF THERE WAS A RUSH TO
JUDGMENT, WE MUST NOT REPEAT
THAT MISTAKE BY RUSHING TO
ACCURACY.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST BECAUSE... JUST BECAUSE THE
CONFESSED MURDERER IS A BLONDE,
BLUE-EYED, NORWEGIAN-BORN
ANTI-SLIM CRUSADER DOES NOT MEAN
HE'S NOT A SWARTHY, ULULATING,
MIDDLE EASTERN MADMAN.
[LAUGHTER]
JIM?
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT
HE LOOKED NORDIC?
>> IN THE FIRST FEW HOURS AFTER
ANY SUCH EVENT, THERE'S SO MUCH
INFORMATION OR MISINFORMATION
DRAWING ABOUT, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO DRAW TOO MANY CONCLUSIONS.
MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD DISGUISE.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Stephen: YES, WHICH IS MORE
PLAUSIBLE: A NON-MUSLIM DID THIS
OR AL QAEDA HAS DEVELOPED
POLY-JUICE POTION?
[APPLAUSE]
NOW, FORTUNATELY COOLER HEADS
ARE COVERING THEIR ASSES.
IN AN EDITORIAL RESPONSE TO
THEIR EDITORIAL, THE "WALL
STREET JOURNAL" CALLS BREIVIK AN
AL QAEDA COPYCAT AND REMINDS US
THAT IF THIS DOES PROVE TO BE
THE WORK OF ISLAMISTS, IT WILL
BE NOTED THAT NEITHER NORWAY'S
OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IN IRAQ
NOR ITS CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL
AND POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE
PALESTINIANS SPARED IT FROM
ATTACK.
AND IF THAT HYPOTHETICAL DAY
SHOULD COME, THAT'S AN IMAGINARY
LESSON THEY WILL NOT SOON
PRETEND TO FORGET.
[LAUGHTER]
AND AS THE "WASHINGTON POST"'S
JENNIFER RUBIN WROTE IN HER
RETRARKS "THE JIHADIST LINKS DID
NOT BARE UP, BUT THERE ARE MANY
MORE JIHADISTS THAN BLONDE
NORWEGIANS OUT THE KILL
AMERICANS."
RIGHT.
SO IF YOU'RE PULLING A NEWS
REPORT COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR
ASS, IT IS SAFER TO GO WITH
MUSLIMS.
THAT'S NOT PREJUDICE.
THAT'S PROBABILITY.
BECAUSE THE NEWS BUSINESS IS ALL
ABOUT GUESSTIMATING, JUST TAKING
SHOTS IN THE DARK.
IT'S FRIDAY, YOU'RE TRYING TO
BEAT THE TRAFFIC FOR THE
WEEKEND, YOU HEAR ABOUT A
HORRIBLE ATTACK AND YOU ROLL THE
BONES AND GO MUSLIM.
SAME WAY WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE
TURN THE WRONG WAY UP A ONE-WAY
STREET YOUR JOURNALISTIC
INSTINCTS GO, "ASIAN."
AFTER ALL, BY JENNIFER RUBIN'S
LOGIC, THERE ARE MANY MORE
ASIANS THAN AMERICANS OUT THERE.
THE POINT IS, THIS MONSTER MAY
NOT BE MUSLIM, BUT HIS HEINOUS
ACTS ARE INDISPUTABLY MUS-LISH.
WE MUST NOT LET HIS ISLAMESQUE
ATROCITIES DIVERT OUR ATTENTION
FROM THE TERRIBLE PEOPLE HE
REMINDS US OF.
NOW, I HAVE A CONFESSION.
SOMETIMES THERE ARE FEELINGS
THAT CROSS MY MIND THAT I DO NOT
IMMEDIATELY REPORT AS NEWS.
WELL, I'M SORRY FOR THAT.
I LET YOU DOWN AND IT WILL NOT
HAPPEN AGAIN.
SO TO MY FELLOW JOURNALISTIC GUN
JUMPERS, I WILL NOW WRITE ALL
THE HEADLINES FOR THE REST OF
THE YEAR.
"BAD THINGS HAPPENED SOMEPLACE.
MUSLIMS INVOLVED."
OKAY.
DONE.
NOW WE CAN PUT OUR JOURNALISTIC
ENERGIES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED,
WRITING THE RETRACTIONS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
