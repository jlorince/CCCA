POOR PEOPLE SEEM TO LOVE THOSE
THINGS.
JOINING ME NOW TO APOLOGIZE FOR
THE GREAT SOCIETY IS THE
ASSOCIATE DEAN OF GEORGETOWN LAW
SCHOOL.
PLEASE WELCOME PETER EDELMAN.
MR. EDELMAN?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, LET'S
GET YOUR C.V. OUT HERE.
YOU BATTLED POVERTY FOR OVER 50
YEARS.
YOU WORKED AS A LEGISLATIVE
ASSISTANT FOR ROBERT KENNEDY IN
THE SENATE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES IN THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION WHERE YOU
RESIGNED OVER WELFARE REFORM.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, AND NOW
YOU'RE WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THE
BATTLE WITH POVERTY AND THE
FUTURE OF THAT STRUGGLE IN
AMERICA.
WE'VE WON THE WAR ON POVERTY,
HAVEN'T WE?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: I READ THIS
REPORT.
THERE AREN'T ANY POOR PEOPLE
ANYMORE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY CAN'T WE JUST, YOU KNOW,
CALL THE TROOPS HOME AND BEAT
OUR PLOW SHARES BACK INTO
SWORDS?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> I WISH WE COULD.
YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT FARM
WORKERS?
CALIFORNIA?
>> Stephen: THEY HAVE ALL THE
FOOD THEY CAN EAT, SIR.
OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR NEXT EVIDENCE?
>> BUT DO THEY HAVE XBOXS?
>> Stephen: NO, BECAUSE
THEY'RE BEING HOGGED BY ALL THE
REST OF THE POOR!
>> I SEE.
>> Stephen: NOW, THE OFFICIAL
CLASSIFICATION FOR POOR IN THE
UNITED STATES IS A FAMILY OF
FOUR WITH INCOME UNDER $22,000 A
YEAR.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S POOR?
>> I THINK IT'S HARD TO LIVE ON
THAT, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: $22,000 A YEAR.
YOU COULD BUY 110 XBOXES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YEAH, WELL, YOU COULD...
>> Stephen: WELL, THEY SEEM TO
BE SPENDING ALL THEIR MONEY ON
THAT.
>> HOW WOULD YOU PAY YOUR RENT
THEN?
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE... I'M SO
INTERESTED IN THIS REPORT.
THERE'S SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN
THIS COUNTRY WHOSE ONLY INCOME
IS FOOD STAMPS.
ONLY INCOME IS FOOD STAMPS WHICH
IS FOR THAT FAMILY THAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT, THAT'S ABOUT 25%
OF THE POVERTY LINE, THAT'S ALL
THEY HAVE.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOT ALL
THESE XBOXES.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YOU SAW THE STATS.
I MEAN, THOSE ARE NUMBERS, SIR.
>> YEAH, THOSE ARE NUMBERS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING
THAT NUMBERS ARE LYING?
>> OH!
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE ANY...
LISTEN...
(LAUGHTER).
SIR.
..
>> THE FACT IS, RIGHT NOW FOOD
STAMPS ARE REALLY HELPING PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE HAVE 44 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THIS RECESSION HA ARE
GETTING THAT HELP AND I'M GLAD
WE DO.
>> Stephen: WELL, FOR ONLY
ABOUT ONE MORE WEEK BECAUSE IF
WE DON'T RAISE THE DEBT CEILING
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
WILL BE CUT RIGHT AWAY.
>> WELL, I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE
FACT THAT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT
PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF WHAT
WE NEED TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: HERE IT COMES.
GO AHEAD.
I'M A RICH GUY, ATTACK ME.
ATTACK ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: AS A RICH GUY, LET
ME TELL YOU: I DON'T SEE ANY
POOR PEOPLE AROUND MY GATED
COMMUNITY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I HAVEN'T CHECKED THE TRAPS
LATELY...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
BUT IF I DON'T SEE EVIDENCE OF
IT, IF I'M WATCHING FOX NEWS AND
I DON'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF POOR
PEOPLE OR IF I DO SEE POOR
PEOPLE THEY LOOK PRETTY WELL
OFF, WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT
HELPING POOR PEOPLE?
>> THAT'S A PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: NOT MY PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE POOR PEOPLE'S
PROBLEM.
WHY DID THEY CHOOSE TO BE POOR?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THEY CHOSE TO BE POOR?
DID THEY...
>> Stephen: POOR IS A CHOICE.
LIKE GUY GAY.
>> 19 MILLION PEOPLE CHOSE TO
HAVE INCOMES BELOW THE POVERTY
LINE?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> SIX MILLION PEOPLE CHOSE TO
HAVE ONLY INCOME OF FOOD STAMPS?
>> Stephen: IT'S CALLED THE
PROTESTANT WORK ETHIC.
GET UP A LITTLE EARLIER.
YOU HAVE TO HUCKER DOWN, YOU
HAVE TO WANT IT.
>> GO OUT TO FIND THAT JOB
THAT'S REALLY OUT THERE RIGHT
TODAY.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> HMM.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A JOB.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: I HAVE A JOB.
ARE WE BETTER THAN POOR PEOPLE?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: THEN WHY DO WE
HAVE JOBS AND THEY DON'T?
>> YOU GOT ME THERE.
>> Stephen: IF WE DON'T GET TO
SEE THE POOR PEOPLE-- AND WE
GENERALLY DON'T GET TO SEE THE
POOR PEOPLE.
>> WOULD YOU GO WITH ME SOME
SOMETIMES AND I'LL SHOW YOU POOR
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU BRING ANY
POOR PEOPLE WITH YOU?
I WAS HOPING THIS WAS GOING TO
BE ONE OF THOSE JACK HANNA
SEGMENTS WHERE YOU BRING ME ON A
BABY POOR FOR ME TO HOLD.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> I CAN DO THAT.
>> Stephen: MAYBE NEXT TIME.
THANK YOU, MR. EDELMAN.
FROM GEORGETOWN, UNIVERSITY.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE, PETER
EDELMAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
