( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE.
WHICH I ASSUME MEANS HE SUPPORTS KNIFE VIOLENCE.
FOR SHAME!
PLEASE WELCOME DAN GROSS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. GROSS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, CIRC LET'S NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH HERE.
YOU AND I ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF AN ISSUE HERE.
FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF LAST WEEK, AND YOU YOUR ORGANIZATION ARE POLITICIZING
THIS TRAGEDY IN ORDER TO TRY TO GET LAWS ON OUR BOOKS THAT CURTAIL THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS OF AMERICANS.
>> WE ARE TRYING-- WE ARE TRYING TO GET LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT WILL SAVE LIVES.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
AND I --
>> Stephen:  IF GUNS ARE OUTLAWED, ONLY OUTOF OUTLAWS HAVE GUNS?
>> I'VE READ THAT BUMPER STICKER AND IT COULDN'T BE ANY LESS TRUE.
THERE ARE POLICIES WE CAN PASS THAT WILL SAVE LIVES, LIKE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND SETS, LIKE
ASSAULT WEAPONS MANS THAT CAN PREVENT TRAGEDIES IN ROAR,
COLORADO, AND TRAGEDIES THAT HAPPEN EVERY DAY IN OUR COUNTRY.
>> Stephen:  AREN'T YOU GUYS POLITICIZING THIS, ISN'T IT MORE
APPROPRIATE-- HEAR ME OUT-- ISN'T IT MORE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE ABOUT
GUNS AND JUST CONTINUE THAT MOMENT OF SILENCE UNTIL THERE'S ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THANK YOU?
AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT OF SILENCE AFTER THAT.
ISN'T THAT MORE RESPECTFUL?
>> IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE RESPECTFUL MOMENT OF SILENCE AFTER A TRAGEDY HAPPENS.
IT WOULD ALSO BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A RESPECTFUL MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE 32 PEOPLE THAT
ARE MURDERED EVERY DAY BY GUNS IN OUR COUNTRY.
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE 12 --
>> Stephen:  BUT THOSE 32 DON'T GET THIS KIND OF COVERAGE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  IF A TREE GETS SHOT IN THE WOODS AND-- AND LET'S SAY IT WAS-- I DON'T
KNOW-- LIKE A VERY DARK CHESTNUT, AND THE PRESS DECIDES NOT TO COVER THAT PARTICULAR
TRAGEDY, IS THE CRISIS ONGOING,
OR ONLY WHEN IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO HORRIFIC AND SO ASSAULTING LIKE THIS?
>> RIGHT, THE REAL HORROR OF GUN VIOLENCE ISN'T NECESSARILY WHAT MAKES THE FRONT PAGE.
THIS WAS A HORRIFIC EVENT IN AURORA, COLORADO.
BUT THE REALITY THAT SAME DAY THERE WERE MORE THAN TWICE THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED ALL
ACROSS AMERICA AND THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO PREVENT THOSE DEATHS AND THINGS OUR
ELECTED OFFICIALS RIGHT UP TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE.
>> Stephen:  RIGHT, BECAUSE OBAMA'S NOT DOING IT EITHER.
DON'T BLAME ROMNEY.
>> I'M NOT.
THIS IS A NONPARTISAN ISSUE AND IT'S SHAMEFUL IN A NONPARTISAN WAY.
THE MOMENT OF SILENCE WE'VE HAD,
THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE'VE CARRIED ON IS SHAMEFUL.
>> Stephen:  YOU HAVE A WEB SITE.
WHAT'S IT CALLED.
>> WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS.ORG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU WANT-- WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO DO WITH THE WEB SITE?
IS THAT WHERE PEOPLE GO TO TURB IN THEIR GUNS AND SAY IT'S OKAY I DON'T NEED MY SECOND AMENDMENT.
>> I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING.
WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYBODY'S GUNS AWAY.
>> Stephen:  YOU WILL WAIT FOR OBAMA'S SECOND TERM.
>> THE SUPREME COURT EULOGY SAID THERE'S A SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT
TO BEAR ARMS BUT THAT RIGHT CAN BE REGULATED IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY.
AND THAT'S ALL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO --
>> Stephen:  A TOTAL LEFTY.
YOU HEARD ABOUT THEIR DECISION ON OBAMA-CARE, RIGHT?
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO ARGUE WITH THAT ONE.
>> Stephen:  ADMIT I'M RIGHT AND MOVE ON.
>> LET'S DO THAT IF IT MEANS WE HAVE MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE LIVES.
>> Stephen:  AREN'T THERE LAWS -- I WAS WATCHING MY GOOD FRIEND
BILL O'REILLY LAST NIGHT, AND HE HAD JASON CHAFEIS ON, A FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
CHAFEIS WAS POINTING OUT THERE ARE ALREADY LAWS ON THE BOOKS.
>> AND BILL O'REILLY WAS ARGUING WITH HIM.
>> Stephen:  BILL CAN BE WRONG.
>> BILL O'REILLY WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE
SECOND AMENDMENT TO-- TO PREVENT GUN DEATHS FROM HAPPENING.
AND THAT WAS THE CONVERSATION THAT HE WANTED TO HAVE LAST NIGHT.
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT I WANT TO HAVE.
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE ON WE SAID AREBETTERTHANTHIS.ORGO.
>> Stephen:  NAME THE ONE LAW.
WE HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS RIGHT NOW.
>> I'LL GIVE YOU BACKGROUND CHECKS.
YES, BACKGROUND CHECKS IS A FEDERAL LAW THANKS TO THE BRADY CAMPAIGN THAT PASSED BACKGROUND
CHECKS IN 1983.
THE PROBLEM IS IT ONLY APPLIES TO 60% OF GUN SALES.
IN 40% OF GUN SALES, A CONVICTED FELON, A DOMESTIC ABUSER, A PERSON ADJUDICATED TO BE
DANGEROUSLY MENTALLY ILL, CAN WALK INTO A GUN SHOW, OVER THE INTERNET AND BUYUL THE GUNS THEY WANT.
THAT IS DANGEROUS.
DANGEROUS.
>> Stephen:  ONCE AGAIN WHAT'S THE WEB SITE?
>> WEAREBETTERTHANTHIS.ORG.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, SIR.
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR CAMPAIGN.
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN.
DAN GROSS,
