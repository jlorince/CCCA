NATION, I LOVE INTERNET MEMES.
THEY TEACH US ABOUT HUMANNATURE.
IN FACT, I LEARNED THAT FROM ANINTERNET MEME.
AND A VIRAL VID-CLIP RECENTLYBURNING UP THE HASH-WEB IS AN
ARGUMENT OVER THE WEATHERBETWEEN TWO TODDLERS.
>> IT'S SPRINKLING.>> IT'S RAINING.
>> NO,.
>> IT'S SPRINKLING.
>> IT'S RAINING.
>> NO, IT'S SPRINKLING!
>> NO, IT'S RAINING.
>> MY MOM TOLD ME IT'SSPRINKLING!
>> IT'S RAINING.
>> NO-->> YES, IT IS.
>> MY MOM TOLD ME IT WASSPRINKLING, NOT RAINING.
>> MY MOM SAID IT'S RAINING.
>> Stephen: IT'S A CLASSICCASE OF HE-SAID-MOM-SAID,
SHE-SAID-MOM-SAID.
AND TALK ABOUT PRECOCIOUS.
THESE KIDS ARE APPEALING TOAUTHORITY TO ARGUE OVER
SOMETHING THEY ACTUALLY KIND OFAGREE ABOUT.
JUST LIKE CABLE NEWS DOES.
YOU SEE, MSNBC--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MSNBC SAYS IT'S SPRINKLING, FOXNEWS SAYS IT'S RAINING AND CNN
SAYS WHATEVER, IT'S WET.
THROW ANDERSON COOPER OUT THEREIN A TIGHT T-SHIRT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY,UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN A CIVIL SHOUTING MATCHERUPTED INTO VIOLENCE.
>> IT'S RAINING!
IT'S RAINING.
>> NO, IT'S NOT!
>> IT'S RAINING.
OW!
>>  ARE YOU OK?
IT'S RAINING.
>> YOU POKED MY HEART
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen: I'M NOT CRYING.
MY FACE IS JUST SPWINKLING.
