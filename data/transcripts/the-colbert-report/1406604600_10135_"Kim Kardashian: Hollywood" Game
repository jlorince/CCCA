(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS,(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> FOLKS, TIME WAS TO BE FAMOUSYOU HAD TO RISE ABOVE YOUR PEERS
IN A GIVEN FIELD. WHETHER IT WASACTING
OR JUMPING OR OWNING A LARGEPAIR OF PANTS.
BUT THESE DAYS FAME ISFINALLY DEMOCRATIZED.
JUST LOOK AT KIM KARDASHIAN.
I AM A HUGE FAN OF WHATEVERIT IS SHE DOES.
(LAUGHTER)SHE HAS PROVEN THAT BECOMING
A CELEBRITY CAN BE A SKILLALL OF ITS OWN.
AND NOW THE TRAGICALLY FAMEDDEFICIENT CAN GET A TASTE OF
HER SUPERSTARDOM ATAMERICA'S MOST EXCLUSIVE
BOUTIQUE, THE APP STORE.
>> REALITY STAR KIMKARDASHIAN LAUNCHED A NEW
VIDEO GAME CALLED KIMKARDASHIAN "HOLLYWOOD"
IN THE GAME SHE INSTRUCTS USERSHOW TO BECOME A-LIST
CELEBRITIES. THEY START OUT ONTHE E LIST, NOT A FAR STRETCH
FROM HER OWN LIFE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE KIM KARDASHIAN HOLLYWOODAPP SIMULATES HER RISE TO
THE A LIST.
TO WIN YOU MUST CAREFULLYNAVIGATE THROUGH 20 LEVELS OR
UPLOAD ONE SEX TAPE.
YOU BEGIN AS A LOWLY E LISTSTORE CLERK UNTIL YOU ARE
APPROACHED BY KIM WHO ISHAVING A FASHION EMERGENCY.
YOU HELP HER PICK FROM ONEOF TWO DRESSES.
THEN HAVE A CHOICE BETWEENGIVING IT TO HER FOR NO
CHARGE OR PLAYING ADIFFERENT GAME BECAUSE THAT
IS THE ONLY OPTION.
BUT ONCE KIM TAKES YOU UNDERHER WING, YOU TAP YOUR WAY
THROUGH THE HOTTEST PHOTOSHOOTS, THE TRENDIEST RUNWAY
SHOWS AND THE MOST VACUOUSCELEBRITY PARTIES AVOIDING
ANYTHING THAT COULD SET BACKYOUR CAREER.
PRO TIP: DO NOT DATE RANDYQUAID.
THE GOAL IS TO BRING YOURAVATAR FROM THE E LIST TO
THE A LIST WHICH TAKES HOURSOF TAPPING ON YOUR SCREEN.
BUT ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'REPUTTING IN IS JUST AS REAL
AS THE FAME YOU'RE ACHIEVING.
(LAUGHTER)BEST OF ALL KIM IS OFFERING
THIS VIRTUAL FRIENDSHIP FORFREE.
ALL SHE GETS IN RETURN ISBRINGING JOY TO HER FANS AND
$85 MILLION.
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKESOME TIME OFF FROM, AGAIN, I
DO NOT KNOW WHAT SHE DOES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HER CASH COMES FROM IN-APP
PURCHASES.
USERS CAN SPEND AS MUCH AS$99.99 FOR 175,000 VIRTUAL
DOLLARS WHICH THEY CAN THENUSE TO BUY THE LIGHTNING
BOLTS OF ENERGY NEEDED TOCOMPLETE TASKS.
OF COURSE A REAL CELEBRITYWOULD NEVER BUY ENERGY.
YOUR ASSISTANT PICKS UPGRAMS OF ENERGY FOR YOU FROM
SOME GUY WITH A FACE TATTOOBEHIND THE IN N OUT BURGER.
FOLKS, SEEING AVERAGEAMERICANS THROW AWAY MILLIONS
ON A CELEBRITY iPHONE GAMEIS DISTURBING BECAUSE I'M
NOT THAT CELEBRITY.
WELL THAT ENDS TONIGHT.
I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE MYAPP, "STEPHEN COLBERT,
I'D TAP THAT."
THE GAME BEGINS(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE GAME BEGINS WHEN YOURAVATAR MEETS WORLD FAMOUS
CELEBRITY STEPHEN COLBERTAND I GREET WITH YOU MY
FAMOUS CATCH-PHRASE, GIVE ME$5.
AND UNLIKE KIM'S GAME YOUHAVE OPTIONS. YOU CAN GIVE
ME $5 OR YOU CAN GIVE ME$10.
THAT SKIPS YOU WRITE TO CLIST FRIEND LEVEL WHERE YOU
HAVE THE CHANCE TO GIVE ME$20.
SO FOLKS, DOWNLOAD NOW ANDSTART TAPPING YOUR MONEY MY
WAY.
I NEED IT.
I'M JUST A FEW DOLLARS SHORTOF THE SILVER SHUTTER
SHADES
I NEED TO GET NVITEDTO KIM'S MIAMI BEACH HOUSE.
