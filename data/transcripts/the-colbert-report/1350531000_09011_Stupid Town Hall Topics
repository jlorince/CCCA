ACCURACY.
AND FOLKS, IT WASN'T JUST THE MODERATOR WHO WAS TURNING THE AUDIENCE AGAINST MITT.
SO WAS THE AUDIENCE, WITH THEIR STUPID QUESTIONS.
RIGHT?
>> AND THE QUESTIONS.
11 QUESTIONS ASKED IN ALL, AND SOME OF WHICH WILL CERTAINLY BE DISCUSSED TOMORROW.
TOPICS THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT AT ALL IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
>> Colbert: YEAH.
STUPID VOTERS.
WHEN YOU ASK QUESTIONS THE CANDIDATE HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE, HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GIVE THE ANSWERS WE HAVE HEARD FOR
MONTHS?  AND JUST LISTEN TO THESE CRAZY SUBJECTS!
>> EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, IN FACT, THERE WERE A LOT OF WOMEN'S ISSUES DISCUSSED.
SOME MIGHT ARGUE IT WAS OBVIOUS PANDERING TO WOMEN.
>> Colbert: YEAH, OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUS, PANDERING.
I AGREE WITH MELVIN KELLEY ON THIS ONE.
WHY, WHY ARE WE TALKING, WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT LADY ISSUES IN THE TOWN HALL?  OKAY?  SAVE IT FOR THE SADIE HAWKINS DEBATE
WHEN THE GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THE ASKING.
AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY OUT OF LEFT FIELD TOPIC NO ONE CARES ABOUT.
>> SEPARATE AND APART FROM EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN WE HEARD A DISCUSSION ABOUT ASSAULT WEAPONS BANS.
>> WHY ARE THEY BRINGING UP ASSAULT WEAPONS?  NOT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO DISCUSS GUN CONTROL.
WE HAVEN'T HAD A MASS SHOOTING IN ALMOST 49 DAYS.
BUT MITT'S ANSWER, MITT'S ANSWER, FOLKS, GOT TO THE ROOT OF OUR SUPPOSED GUN PROBLEM.
>> WHAT I BELIEVE IS WE HAVE TO DO AS THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED TOWARDS THE END OF HIS REMARKS THERE, WHICH IS TO MAKE ENORMOUS
EFFORTS TO ENFORCE THE GUN LAWS THAT WE HAVE AND TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE WE HAVE.
BUT LET ME MENTION ANOTHER THING.
AND THAT IS PARENTS.
WE NEED MOMS AND DADS HELPING RAISE KIDS.
WHEREVER POSSIBLE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING TWO PARENTS IN THE HOME, AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE.
A LOT OF GREAT SINGLE MOMS, SINGLE DADS, BUT GOSH TO TELL OUR KIDS THAT BEFORE THEY HAVE BABIES THEY OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED TO SOMEONE, THAT IS GREAT IDEA.
>> Colbert: ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY, FOLKS.  THE ANSWER TO GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT GETTING RID OF ASSAULT WEAPONS IT IS A TWO PARENT HOME.
BECAUSE WHEN A PSYCHOPATH MARCHS INTO THE MALL IN KEVLAR BODY ARMOR, SLOWLY LIFTING THE LASER SIGHT OF HIS AK 47 TOWARD THE
SUNGLASS HUT, THE ONLY THING THAT WILL STOP HIM FROM CARNAGE IS WHEN HE ASKS HIMSELF, WHAT WOULD MOM
