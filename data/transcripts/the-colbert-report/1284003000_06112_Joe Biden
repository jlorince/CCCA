PLEASE.
AT EASE.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS I HOPE THE
REASON I'VE BEEN STRIP SEARCHED
14 SEPARATE TIMES TODAY.
PLEASE WELCOME AND THANK VICE
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
>> HAPPY TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: I HOPE I DIDN'T
STARTLE YOU WITH ME HEROICS OVER
THERE.
>> NO, NEW YORK CONSERVATIVES
ALWAYS DO THAT TO ME.
>> Stephen: SIR, HOW DOES IT
FEEL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AN
HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE.
>> HONOR TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT
MAN IN AMERICA?
DO YOU EVER GET JEALOUS OF ME?
[LAUGHTER]
>> CONSTANTLY.
PARTICULARLY YOUR HAIR.
>> Stephen: I GAVE A COPY TO
RAY ODIERNO.
>> I THINK I MAY NEED IT.
>> Stephen: SIR, YOU WERE
GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
HELPING TO BRING THE IRAQ WAR TO
A CLOSE, WORKING WITH THE
GOVERNMENT OVER THERE TO TRY TO
BRING THIS TO AN ORDERLY EXIT.
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE GREATEST
CHALLENGES THE UNITED STATES
FACES?
>> THE GREATEST CHALLENGES,
TAKING A COUNTRY THAT HAD NEVER
HAD A DEMOCRACY, HAVING JUST HAD
AN ELECTION WHERE ONE PARTY, THE
MOST THEY GOT WAS 91 VOTES.
THERE'S 325 PEOPLE IN THEIR
PARLIAMENT.
THEY GOT TO GET 163.
AND PUTTING A GOVERNMENT
TOGETHER.
THAT'S THE MOST CHALLENGING
PIECE, BUT THEY'RE DOING IT.
>> Stephen: WELL, POLITICS...
THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.
>> THEY'RE WORKING ON A
POLITICAL SOLUTION, SHARED
POWER, AND ALL THE MAJOR GROUPS
ARE PARTICIPATING.
SO I'M CONFIDENT THEY'RE GOING
TO GET A GOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A SON WHO
SERVED IN IRAQ.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: AS PARENT OF
SOMEONE WHO SERVED OVER THERE,
DO YOU THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THIS
COUNTRY THAT ONLY 1.5% OF
AMERICANS SERVED OVER IN IRAQ?
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT US AS A
COUNTRY?
>> MY SON CAME HOME AFTER A YEAR
IN IRAQ.
I WATCHED AT THE COMING HOME
CEREMONYING AND I WATCHED HIS
THREE-YEAR-OLD SON GRAB AND HANG
ON TO HIS HEAD, WOULD NOT LET
HIM GO, HIS DAUGHTER HANGING ON
HIS LEG AND I FELT ALMOST GUILTY
BECAUSE IN MY HOME STATE OF
DOVER, THE 5,686 FALLEN AGELES
THAT HAVE DIED IN IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTAN COME THROUGH THAT
MORTUARY, AND HERE I WAS WITHIN
TWO MILES OF THERE BRINGING MY
SON HOME, WELCOMING HIM, AND ALL
I COULD THINK OF WAS ALL THOSE
FAMILIES.
EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMEBODY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO HAS
GIVEN BEYOND ANYTHING ANYONE
COULD EXPECT OF THEM.
AND I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT ALL
THE TRIPS I'VE MADE THE IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTAN THAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE SEE WHAT THESE GUYS DO.
YOU KNOW, I...
>> Stephen: THE MESH PEOPLE
GET TOLD THESE GUYS DO.
WHAT CAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO
TO HONOR THE SACRIFICE THESE
PEOPLE HAVE MADE?
>> I KNOW THIS IS... I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE SERIOUS, BUT DO
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, HONORING
THESE GUYS.
LOOK, IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY...
>> Stephen: SIR, ANY TIME YOU
WANT THE PRAISE THINGS I DO, YOU
GO RIGHT AHEAD.
I DON'T CARE HOW SERIOUS IT
SOUNDS.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ME SEEM LIKE
A HERO, WHO AM I TO STOP YOU?
>> THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE.
IF THERE'S SOMEONE IN YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD, 100% OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE AN
OBLIGATION, WHO HAS SOMEONE
DEPLOYED IN IRAQ, PARTICULARLY
IF IT'S A HUSBAND OR WIFE.
GO AND OFFER TO BABY-SIT, CUT
THEIR LAWN, LITERALLY JUST LET
THEM.
THEY'LL TELL YOU.
ALL THEIR FAMILIES WANT TO KNOW
IS YOU UNDERSTAND THE SACRIFICE
THEY MAKE.
IS THAT RIGHT, GUYS?
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: AS I SAID, THEY'RE
STILL 50,000 TROOPS OVER IN
BAGHDAD.
ARE WE GOING TO GET THOSE GUYS
OUT IN THE NEXT YEAR?
IS THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO
HAPPEN?
AS I SAID, THEY'VE WON IT,
THEY'VE WON IT AND THEY'VE WON
IT.
DO THEY HAVE TO WIN IT AGAIN?
>> WE HAVEN'T SAID WE WON IT.
WE'VE SAID THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT
MILESTONE.
>> WHY HAVEN'T YOU SAID YOU WON
IT?
SHOULDN'T WE HAVE A PARADE FOR
PEOPLE WHO HAVE WON IT?
WOULD YOU LIKE A PARADE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
COME ON.
>> THEY DESERVE A PARADE.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> EVERY HOMECOMING THEY'VE GONE
TO, THEY GET SOME SORT OF A
PARADE, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL,
THERE'S 50,000 TROOPS STILL
THERE, AND UNTIL THEY'RE HOME,
UNTIL WE KEEP PRESIDENT BUSH'S
COMMITMENT THAT HE SIGNED WITH
THE IRAQIS THAT ALL THE TROOPS
WILL BE OUT OF THERE BY THE END
OF NEXT YEAR, THIS IS A
SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE, BUT WE'RE
NOT THERE YET.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
PRESIDENT BUSH FOR A SECOND.
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS GOT SOME
CRITIQUE, SOME CRITICISM FROM ME
AND MY CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS THAT
YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH CREDIT
TO PRESIDENT BUSH.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO LOOK
OVER THERE...
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.
YOU'VE HONORED THESE GUYS.
YOU'VE HONORED THESE WOMEN.
YOU'VE HONORED THESE TROOPS.
I'VE KNOWN YOU YOUR ENTIRE EIGHT
YEARS AS PRESIDENT.
I'VE NEVER KNOWN A TIME WHEN YOU
DIDN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED.
WE DISAGREED ON POLICY, BUT YOU
DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT,
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, I
NEVER DISAGREED WITH YOUR
POLICIES.
SO I THANK YOU, AND I
