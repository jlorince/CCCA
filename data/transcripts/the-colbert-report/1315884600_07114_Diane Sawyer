(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HOST OF
THE NEW ABC NEWS PRIME TIME
SPECIAL "JACQUELINE KENNEDY:
IN HER OWN WORDS"
>> BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU
ONE ONE OF THING ABOUT HIM,
I WAS REALLY, I WAS NEVER
ANY DIFFERENT ONCE I WAS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE THAN I WAS
BEFORE.
BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING THAT
HAD BEEN A LIABILITY BEFORE,
YOUR HAIR, THAT YOU SPOKE
FRENCH, THAT YOU DIDN'T JUST
ADORE THE CAMPAIGN AND YOU
DIDN'T BAKE BREAD WITH FLOUR
UP TO YOUR ARMS.
THEN WE GOT IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, ALL THE THINGS THAT I
HAD ALWAYS DONE, SUDDENLY
BECAME WONDERFUL.
AND I WAS SO HAPPY FOR JACK,
THAT HE COULD BE PROUD OF ME
THEN.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT MADE
HIM SO HAPPY.
IT MADE ME SO HAPPY.
THOSE WERE HAPPY YEARS.
>> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME
DIANE SAWYER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DIANE GOOD TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
(APPLAUSE)
OH MY GOSH, I JUST, YOU
FORGET, IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT
JACQUELINE KENNEDY FOR A
WHILE, THAT YOU REALLY
SHOULD JUST KEEP ONE EYE
COVERED TO PRESERVE ONE OF
YOUR RETINAS BECAUSE --
>> DAZZLING.
>> Stephen: SHE'S SO
DAZZLING IT BURNS YOUR EYES
OUT.
>> EXOTIC.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE SPEING.
ABC WORLD NEWS, YOU'RE THE
HOST, ANCHOR OF ABC WORLD
NEWS.
HOW DO YOU FIND TIME TO DO A
SPECIAL WHEN YOU ARE
ANCHORING EVERY NIGHT?
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE DAYS, I
HAVE WEEKENDS.
>> Stephen: SEE, I DON'T.
I DON'T LEAVE THIS BUILDING.
>> NOBODY, YOU DON'T.
>> Stephen: I'M FAR MORE
DEDICATED TO MY SHOW THAN
YOU ARE.
ARE YOU TELLING ME ARE YOU
PHONING IN THE NIGHTLY NEWS.
>> THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE THIS
CROWD YELLING STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
EVERY NIGHT.
>>
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WE DO NORKTS I
PROMISE, YOU, WE DON'T HAVE
TIME.
>> AND I DID NOT HAVE
ANYBODY YELLING BEFORE I GO
ON THE NEWS.
>> Stephen: WE CAN FIX THIS.
YOU WANT THESE PEOPLE OVER
AT YOUR STUDIO?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: DIANE, DIANE,
DIANE!
DIANE, DIANE, DIANE!
SOUNDS NICE, DOESN'T IT?
YOU ARE IN THE WRONG
BUSINESS.
>> REALLY, REALLY.
I WAS GOING TO SAY.
>> Stephen: NOW THE SPECIAL
IS CALLED IN HER OWN WORDS.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: BUT THESE TAPES
ARE FROM THE 1960s.
WERE WOMEN ALLOWED TO HAVE
THEIR OWN WORDS BACK THEN.
I THOUGHT THEIR HUSBAND KOS
HAVE THEM COMMITTED IF THEY
USED THEIR OWN WORDS.
WHAT IS UNUSUAL ABOUT WHAT
WE'RE HEARING FROM THE FIRST
LADY HERE.
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU
SHOULD KNOW IT IS FOUR
MONTHS AFTER THE
ASSASSINATION.
AND SHE WILLS HERSELF TO SIT
DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE
YEARS THAT ARE STILL PAINFUL
FOR HER TO REMEMBER.
BUT, YOU SEE THIS WOMAN WHO
IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE
WOMAN BEHIND THE SUNGLASSES
AND THE WOMAN WITH THE
SMILE.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE SAT DOWN IN SUCH A
PAINFUL TIME?
>> SHE DID IT FOR HIS TREE.
SHE LOVED READING BOOKS
ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT SOME
OF THE PROCESS BUT THE
PEOPLE WHO CHANGED THE WORLD
AND THE IDEAS THAT CHANGED
THE WORLD.
AND SHE REALLY DID IT
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A
PRIVILEGE TO BE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
AND SHE THOUGHT SHE OWD IT
TO HISTORY, AS DIFFICULT AS
IT WAS, FOR HER TO DO.
>> Stephen: THERE IS SOME
REVELATIONS THAT HAVE COME
OUT OF THIS.
SHE CALLED CHARLES DE GAULLE
AN EGO-- EGO MAN YA, GANDHI
A PUSHI, HORRIBLE WOMAN.çó
COMPARED LADY BIRD JOHNSON
TO A TRAINED HUNTING DOG.
>> SHE DID.
SHE SAID SHE HAD-- SHE
SOUNDS MUCH TOUGHER THAN WE
THINK OF HER.
>> YOU KNOW, SHE HAS AN
ABSOLUTE EYE FOR HUMAN FOIBL
AND SHE CAN'T RESIST SAYING
WHAT SHE REALLY SAW.
AND TAKE THESE PICTURES
WHERE YOU SEE HER SMILING AT
PEOPLE AND THEN YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT
THEM.
BECAUSE SHE-- .
>> Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE
IF YOU CROSSED HER SHE WOULD
SWEEP THE LEGS.
>> WHAT SHE-- WHAT SHE
WANTED TO DO WAS TELL THE
TRUTH ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE
WERE REALLY BEHAVING.
BECAUSE THAT WAS HER
HISTORICAL EYE, AS SHE WAS
TAKING US THROUGH IT.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE WE ONLY
HEARING THESE RECORDINGS
NOW.
>> THE RECORDINGS ARE ONLY
OUT NOW BECAUSE CAROL
INKENNEDY DECIDE ON THE 50th
ANNIVERSARY OF HER FATHER'S
INAUGURATION THAT IT WAS
TIME.
THEY WERE SEALED IN AN VAULT,
AT THE KENNEDY LIBRARY
BECAUSE HER MOTHER SAID SHE
SHOULDN'T BE RELEASED UNTIL
LONG AFTER HER DEATH.
AND CAROLYN DECIDED THAT
THIS WAS THE YEAR TO DO
THEM.
AND BY THE WAY, SHE DIDN'T
EDIT THEM.
AND ONE OF THE WONDERFUL
THINGS YOU SEE IN THESE
TAPES IS SHE STARTS OUT AND
SHE'S SO SHY AND SHE'S SO
PRIVATE.
AND SHE IS NOT MADE FOR THE
KENNEDY NATURAL POLITICAL
STYLE.
AND OVER TIME, THIS THING
HAPPENS.
IN WHICH SUDDENLY SHE'S ONE
OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL
ASSETS ANYONE EVER HAD IN
THEIR LIVES.
AND YOU GET TO SEE HER
EMERGE.
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO THOUGHT
SHE WAS GOING TO BE A
WITNESS TO HISTORY AND ENDED
UP, SHE MADE IT HERSELF.
SHE MADE HISTORY.
>> Stephen: CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH
ACTUALLY PLAYING THESE
TAPES.
AND I GUESS THE BONE IS WITH
YOU AND WITH CAROLYN.
AND IT'S-- WE LEARN THINGS
THAT I DON'T THINK WE NEED
TO FOE ABOUT OUR LEADERS.
BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT THAT
AFTER THE BAY OF PIGS, SHE
SAYS IN THE RECORDING THAT
PRESIDENT KENNEDY CRIED.
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT MY
PRESIDENT IS BLUBBERING OVER
ANYTHING.
I WANT TO KNOW THAT MY
PRESIDENT IS STALWART AND
STEELLY.
DOESN'T THAT WEAKEN SOMEHOW
THEÑi MEMORY OF PRESIDENT
KENNEDY TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT HIM?
>> HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
CRIED.
>> I HAVE NEVER CRIED.
>> NEVER?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I HAVE NEVER FOR
ANY REASON CRIED.
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE
ME START CRYING NOW.
BARBARA WALTERS COULDN'T DO
IT AND YOU CAN'T DO IT
EITHER.
>> STEPHEN, I JUST WANT TO
TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
NOT EVER HAVING CRIED.
BECAUSE-- .
>> Stephen: I FEEL FINE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: DAMN YOU, DAMN
YOU, YOU GOT ME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, DIANE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: DIANE SAWYER,
DIANE, DIANE, DIANE, DIANE!
JACQUELINE KENNEDY IN HER
OWN WORDS AIRS TOMORROW
NIGHT AT 9:00 ON ABC.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU, DIANE.
