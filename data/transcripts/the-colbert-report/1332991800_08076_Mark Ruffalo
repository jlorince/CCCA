( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR WHO IS HERE TO DISCUSS HYDRAULIC FRACKING
WHICH IS PERFECT BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO GET DRILLED.
PLEASE WELCOME MARK RUFFALO ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
MARK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON, BIG FAN.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME,
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  I'M ABOUT TO TEAR YOU A NEW ONE, BUDDY.
>> I THINK I'M READY.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, MOVIE STAR MAN, LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR
EF WITH OUR ENERGY POLICY.YOURBE WE KNOW YOU'RE AN ACTOR,
PRODUCER, WRITER, OSCAR NOM NEERK LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY'S OLD BOYFRIEND.
NOW, YOU HAVE THIS THING CALLED WATER DEFENSE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  WHAT IS THAT?
>> WELL, LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS WHERE WE JUST STICK A STRAW IN THE GROUND AND GET BEAUTIFUL,
CONCENTRATED CARBON-BASED FUEL OUT OF THE GROUND.
NOW WE HAVE HYDROFRACKING, TAR SANDS, MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL, DEEP SEA DRILLING.
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS DESTROY WATER, AND IN PARTICULAR,
HYDROFRACKING.
SO WE'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF-- THIS PUBLICITY PUSH TO GET HYDROFRACKING, BUT WE HAVEN'T
HEARD THE OPPOSITION.
>> Stephen:  EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT HYDROFRACKING IS.
YOU HAVE ALL THIS GAS, NATURAL GAS, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  IT'S TRAPPED UNDERGROUND.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  WHERE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE AND IT COULD EXPLODE
AT ANY MOMENT.
>> AT REQUEST MOMENT.
>> Stephen:  AND THE ENERGY COMPANY GOES IN AND FREE THAT NATURAL GAS BY SHATTERING THE
BEDROCK WITH WATER UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  AND THIS THEN THAT GAS--
>> THEY PUT CHEMICALS IN THAT WATER, A LOT OF CHEMICALS,
150,000 GALLONS PER WELL.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE THE CHEMICALS?
>> THEY WON'T TELL GLUS THEY WON'T TELL US WHAT'S IN "5-HOUR
ENERGY," EITHER.
WHY IS THAT NECESSARILY DANGEROUS?
WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR YOU?
WE HAVE ENOUGH GAS IN THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE US THE SAUDI ARABIA OF NATURAL GAS.
>> THAT HAS BEEN DEBUNGED.
THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SERVICE CAME OUT AND SAID-- THEY DEBUNKED IT BY 80%.
THEY DROPPED THOSE NUMBERS BY 80%.
IT WAS 100 YEARS WORTH OF GAS.
NOW IT'S 20 YEARS WORTH OF GAS AT THE RATE WE'RE USING IT RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen:  I HAVE TWO WORDS FOR YOU, SIR-- NORTH DAKOTA.
>> OUCH.
>> Stephen:  THIS WHOLE COUNTRY COULD BE NORTH DAKOTA,
OKAY, THE ENDLESS MAN CAMPS SHATTERING BEDROCK.
WHY-- WE DON'T KNOW HOW--
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD.
THAT'S NOT GOOD!
>> Stephen:  BUT IT'S A JOB CREATOR.
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE ADS WITH THE NONTHREATENING ATTRACTIVE BLOND LADY SAYING ONE MILLION JOBS.
>> I HAVE.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, IT'S AN AD.
THESE PEOPLE AREN'T SCIENTISTS.
THEY'RE SELLING GAS.
THEY'RE SELLING FRACKING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AS IF THEY'RE--
THE THEY'RE THE SCIENTISTS, AS IF THEY'RE GOING TO TEACH US SOMETHING.
WE CAN'T FORGED GET.
WE'RE WATCHING ADS.
THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DESTROYING OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR THE LAST 70 YEARS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US TO THIS POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THIS
DISCUSSION, WHERE WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW, ARE RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY --
>> Stephen:  LIKE WHAT.
WE BURN THINGS.
WE BURN THINGS BETTER THAN ANYBODY HAS EVER BURNED THINGS.
AMERICA WAS BUILT ON BURNING THINGS.
( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY?
>> HOW DO I ARGUE WITH THAT?
>> Stephen:  YOU DON'T.
( APPLAUSE ) SO WHAT ARE THESE-- WHAT ARE THESE-- WHAT ARE THESE RENEWABLE, SUPPOSEDLY RENEWABLE THINGS?
>> WIND, WATER, SOLAR WE CAN DO IT.
>> Stephen:  OH, COME ON.
IN YOUR BACKYARD, MR.--
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  MR. HYANNIS PORT.
>> I HAVE A 14 KILOWATT SOLAR ARRAY IN MY BACKYARD THAT POWERS MY HOME
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
>> Stephen:  WHAT DO I CENTER?
IN MY BACKYARD I HAVE A GIANT POOL OF OIL THAT I SET ON FIRE AT NIGHT AND I READ BY IT.
( LAUGHTER ).
ANOTHER SO THERE'S PART OF IT.
SOLAR IS PART OF IT, BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TYKE UP THE WHOLE THING.
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SUN TO GO AROUND.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH SUN,
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH SUN, YOU CAN--
>> WAIT.
>> I WANT TO GET ONE WORD --
>> Stephen:  YOU CANNOT.
NO, NO-- ( APPLAUSE )
>> PLEASE I WANT TO SAY ONE --
>> Stephen:  YOU CANNOT RUN--
>> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO-- DON'T LOOK AT HER.
>> Stephen:  I'M OVER HERE,
BABY.
YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR CAR.
YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR CAR ON THE SUN.
IT IS HUGE AND SUPER HOT.
YOU'LL USULE THE ENERGY RUNNING YOUR AIR CONDITIONER.
( LAUGHTER ).
SO GO ON, GO ON.
>> GERMANY, GERMANY TODAY, RIGHT NOW-- WE'RE NOT INVENTING THIS TECHNOLOGY.
GERMANY, THAT MECCA OF SUNLIGHT THAT WAS SO WELL KNOWN FOR GETTING US A PLACE TO GET A
GREAT TAN, RIGHT?
30% OF THEIR ENERGY IS COMING FROM SUN.
AMERICA'S BEING LEFT BEHIND.
( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE BEING LEFT BEHIND ALL OVER THE WORLD.
>> Stephen:  MORE DELICIOUS OIL FOR ME, SIR.
>> BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT-- YOU KNOW HOW I GOT IS INTO THIS?
>> Stephen:  BECAUSE YOU DRING WATER.
LET ME GUESS.
>> FROM A WELL.
THAT'S DRILLED UNDER MY HOME.
>> Stephen:  REAL AMERICANS CONSIST ON THE MOISTURE FROM CORN DOGS.
WHY DID YOU GET INTO IT?
>> I LIVE WHERE THEY WANT TO DO THIS.
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD.
I SAW THE COMMERCIAL-- HEY,
HYDROFRACKING, THAT'S A GREAT NAME.
LET'S FRAC THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THIS PLACE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE GREAT.
IT WAS GOING TO SAVE US.
IT WAS GOING TO GIVE US OUR OWN ENERGY.
WE WERE GOING TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT.
THEN I WENT TO DIMOCK, P.A., AND I SAW WHAT IT DOES TO FAMILIES.
I SAW-- THESE PEOPLE CAN'T DRINK THE WATER THAT'S COMING OUT OF
THEIR TAP HERE IN AMERICA.
THAT'S A THIRD WORLD THING.
>> Stephen:  WHAT HAPPENS TO THE WATER?
>> THE WATER IS FULL OF POISON,
AND IT'S FULL OF GAS.
THEIR HOUSES CAN BLOW UP.
>> Stephen:  WHAT?
>> YES, THIS IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA PUP SHOULD BE OUTRAGED.
THIS IS-- IT'S DESTROYING PEOPLE'S LIVES, THEIR PROPERTIES.
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE TONIGHT THAT ARE THE VICTIMS OF THAT.
AND I SAW THAT.
AND I-- AND I SAID TO MYSELF, IF I AM WHO I SAY I AM, THEN I HAVE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THIS AND
I HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT IT.
AND THERE'S A-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY'S LIVES
DESTROYED, AND YOU SEEM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS.
AND YOU SAY-- IF YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE--
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  CAN I SUGGEST SOMETHING?
YOU'RE ALSO-- YOU'RE ALSO THE "HULK." THE NEW "AVENGERS" MOVIE.
YOU'RE ALSO THE HULK, AREN'T YOU?
>> DON'T MAKE ME ANGRY.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  THAT I WILL AGREE WITH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, MARK RUFFALO.
>> I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.
>> Stephen:  MARK RUFFALO.
