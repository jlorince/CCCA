>> Stephen: HEY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY THANKS SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I DON'TKNOW ABOUT YOU BUT IT SEEMS
THAT EVERY TIME I TURN ONTHE NEWS CHANNELS ALL I HEAR
IS DOOM AND GLOOM.
THEY'RE TOO FOCUSED ON THENEGATIVE, YES, 700 CRUISE
SHIP PASSENGERS SPENT A WEEKSQUIRTING LIQUIDS AT HIGH
PRESSURE FROM EVERY HOLE INTHEIR BODY.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE UPSIDE?
A CRUISE WHERE YOU LOSE TENPOUNDS?
SIGN ME UP.
THAT'S WHY EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THOSE NEGATIVE NELLIES
NEED TO TAKE THEIR HEAD OUTOF THE OVEN AND STICK IT
INTO STEPHEN COLBERT'S SMILEFILE.
TONIGHT ON THE SMILE FILE ALQAEDA.
FOLKS, PEOPLE SAY YOU NEVERHEAR ANY GOOD NEWS FROM IRAQ,
NOT TRUE.
SUMERIANS GAVE THE WORLDCUNEIFORM SCRIPT IN THE 4th
MILLENNIUM B.C., NICE WORK,GUYS, OR SHOULD I SAY WEDGE
HEDGE DOG, SLANTY DIAMOND.
BUT THE LATEST NEWS OUT OFIRAQ IS SURE TO TURN THAT
CRESCENT MOON UPSIDE DOWN.
>> A GROUP OF POTENTIALSUICIDE BOMBERS IN IRAQ
WON'T GET TO CARRY OUT THEIRPLANS BECAUSE THEY WERE
ACCIDENTALLY KILLED DURING ATRAINING EXERCISE.
21 MEMBERS OF A CAR BOMBTRAINING CLASS WERE BLOWN UP
WHEN THEIR AL QAEDAINSTRUCTOR UNWITTINGLY SET
OFF THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGE.
>> Z HEY, THOSE WHO CAN DOTHOSE CHO WHO CAN'T TEACH,
AND THOSE WHO CAN'T TEACHACCIDENTALLY BLOW THEMSELVES
UP.
(LAUGHTER)THAT SORT OF HANDS
ON-- (APPLAUSE)
>> BIG EXPLOSION FANS HERETONIGHT.
FOLKS, IT'S THAT KIND OFHANDS-ON TEACHER REMINDS ME
OF DEAD POET SOCIETY, ONLYWITHOUT THE POETS, OR THE
SOCIETY.
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT ALQAEDA, THEY VALUE EDUCATION.
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY, GAVE AMAN A SUICIDE BOMB HE BLOWS
UP ONCE, TEACH A MAN TOSUICIDE BOMB, HE ALSO BLOWS
UP ONCE.
(LAUGHTER)STILL WORKING OUT THE KINKS
ON THAT ONE.
BUT FOLKS THE VIOLENT DEATHOF 22 PEOPLE ISN'T THE ONLY
RAY OF SUNSHINE HERE.
BECAUSE THERE WERE ALSO 15OTHER TERRORISTS WOUNDED.
OKAY, JUST WOUNDED MEANSTHEY'RE NOT QUITE MARTYRS,
THEY'RE JUST MARTISH, ANDINSTEAD OF 72 VIRGINS THEY
GET ONE 72-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN,EVEN BETTER, EVEN BETTER,
FOLKS, SECURITY FORCES WEREDRAWN TO THE AREA BY THE
SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION ANDARRESTED 22 SURVIVORS,
INCLUDING THE MASTERMIND OFTHE GROUP WILE E AL COYOTE.
AND IT'S NO SURPRISE-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THATI'M NOT THE ONLY ONE La, La,
La, La, LOVING THIS STORY.
ONE LOCAL IRAQI REACTED BYSAYING THIS IS SO FUNNY T
SHOWS HOW STUPID THEY ARE,THOSE DOGS AND SONS OF DOGS.
IT IS HILARIOUS.
IT'S LIKE JACKASS ONLY WITHMORE REDEEMING SOCIAL VALUE.
FOLKS, IT'S STORIES LIKETHIS THAT MAKE YOU NOT ASK
THE QUESTION, WHY DO BADTHINGS HAPPEN TO BAD PEOPLE?
GOD OFTEN WORKS INMYSTERIOUS WAYS.
BUT SOMETIMES HE MAKES SOMEREALLY OBVIOUS CHOICES.
AND THAT'S THE SMILE FILE.
REMEMBER, IF YOU ARE'SFEELING BLUE, JUST BE GLAD
YOU'RE NOT FEELING BLEWEDUP. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
