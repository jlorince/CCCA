SLEEVES AND RAISING YOUR
A.T.M. FEES
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I GOTTA SAY, I LOVE THE
AMERICAN JOBS ACT.
NO, JIMMY, JIMMY, NOT OBAMA'S
BILL.
THAT THING IS A HEAT-SEEKING
TURD.
NO.
( LAUGHTER )
I AM TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER
AMERICAN JOBS ACT REULOSED
YESTERDAY BY TEXAS REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN AND TEQUILA WORM
STUNT DOUBLE LOUIE GOHMERT.
YOU SEE, DESPITE RUNNING AROUND
WITH THEIR HAIR ON FIRE, THE
PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATS
FORGOT TO FILE THEIR BILL WITH
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
SO GENTLEMANERT GOT THERE FIRST
AND FILED HIS OWN BILL WITH THE
EXACT SAME THEY WILL IT'S
AMERICAN JOBS ACT.
THAT'S WHAT POLITICAL STIFFS
CALL A PARLIAMENTARY ( BLEEP )
BLOCK.
( LAUGHTER )
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU I HAVE A
COPY OF IT RIGHT HERE.
GOHMERT'S AMERICAN JOBS ACT HAS
EVERYTHING.
IT INCLUDES CORPORATE TAX
CUTS...
AND THAT'S IT
( LAUGHTER )
GOHMERIT BOLDLY DROPS CORPORATE
TAX RATES FROM 35% TO 0%.
NOW, 0% MAY SOUND PRETTY LOW,
BUT THAT IS STILL MORE THAN G.E.
