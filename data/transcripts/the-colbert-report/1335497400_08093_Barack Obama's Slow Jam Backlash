>> Stephen:  YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen:  NICE, NICE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING.
BEFORE WE START OFF, I JUST WANT TO SAY I WOULD LIKE TO DO TONIGHT'S SHOW FOR THE WHALES.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, NATION, THE GENERAL
ELECTION IS IN FULL SWING.
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY VOTING BLOC THAT MATTERS, OTHER THAN STAY-AT-HOME MOMS, SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE HISPANIC DADS, AND EVANGELICAL NASCAR UNCLES ARE THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU SEE-- I GOT THE YOUNG DEMO.
IN THE 2008 ELECTION, BARACK OBAMA HAD THE KIDS IN THE PALM OF HIS HANDS.
HE WAS AN HISTORIC CANDIDATE.
HE SPOKE THEIR LANGUAGE, AND HE BRIEFLY TOURED WITH THE BLACK EYED PEAS.
BUT, MR. FRESH-FACED HOPEY-CHANGEY OF 2008 HAS NOW BECOME OLD GRAY HAIRED GRANDPA
DIDN'T CLOSE GITMO.
AND THE YOUNGLINGS ARE IN PLAY.
>> THE POLAROID NEEDS THESE VOTERS BADLY.
IN 2008 HE WON THE YOUTH VOTE BY 66%.
>> BUT SOME OF THAT ENTHUSIASM HAS WANED.
JUST 45% SAY THEY HAVE A HIGH INTEREST IN THE FALL ELECTION.
>> I THINK IF OBAMA LOSES THE HUGE EDGE HE HAS AMONG YOUTH IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY
CLOSE ELECTION.
>> COUNT CHOCULA IS RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
GOOD TO SEE HIM GETTING WORK.
GOOD TO SEE HIM GETTING WORK.
THIS COULD BE CLOSE FOR OBAMA,
AND OBAMA IS CLEARLY PANICKING.
BECAUSE ON TUESDAY, IN A BLATANT PANDER TO THE YOUTH VOTE, OBAMA WENT ON THE JIMMY FALLON
GIGGLE-TIME NEWS HOUR TO TALK ABOUT HIS STUDENT LOAN POLICY.
IT WAS A PATHETICALLY SUCCESSFUL PLOY TO BE APPEALING.
AND FOX NEWS NAILED HIM FOR IT.
>> HE'S ON JIMMY FALLON SLOW JAMMING ABOUT A POLICY THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO HELP ANYBODY.
>> HE NEEDS TO LOOK PRESIDENTIAL.
DOES THIS MAKE SOMEBODY SITTING AT HOME WITHOUT A JOB, YOU KNOW,
WITHOUT A HOME, OR A HOME FACING FORECLOSURE SAYING, "I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM"?
>> SO LAME, SO UNFUNNY.
>> I JUST PERSONALLY DO NOT AGREE WITH THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE LAND, THE MOST IMPORTANT
FIGURE IN WORLD GOING ON THESE COMEDY SHOWS.
I THINK IT LOWERS THE STATUS OF THE OFFICE.
>> THE PROFIT UNITED STATES ORDINARILY WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HARRY TRUMAN WOULDN'T DO THAT.
>> Stephen:  EXACTLY.
WHY CAN'T OBAMA BE MORE LIKE HARRY TRUMAN.
HE KNEW HOW TO REACH OUT TO THE YOUTH VOTE-- NUKE JAPAN.
NOW, IF OBAMA MUST GO ON THESE SHOWS, HE SHOULD DO IT WITH DIGNITY, LIKE ROMNEY DID ON "LETTERMAN.
>> NUMBER 9.
>> WHAT'S UP GANGSTA, IT'S THE M-I-DOUBLE FIZZLE.
>> Stephen:  NOW THAT'S KIND OF GRAVITAS WE WANT IN THE LEADER OF THE FREE WIZZLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE, CLEARLY, LISTEN TO HIM.
MITT IS DOWN WITH THE HOMIES.
HE HAS TO BE.
HE HAS SO MANY HOMIES.
AND THE MOST DEVASTATING SLAM OF OBAMA'S FALLON FIASCO CAME FROM
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMIT WHOA SHOWED AMERICA'S YOUTH THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLASS CLOWN AND CLASS PRESIDENT.
IN THIS POWERFUL AD, A TALE OF TWO LEADERS.
>> EVERYWHERE I GO, AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF BEING TIRED.
AND MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A JOB,
ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS.
>> NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO MAKE SCHOOL MORE EXPENSIVE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> OOOHHH, YEAH.
>> Stephen:  HASHTAG, NOT FUNNY.
TURN OFF YOURsma?ï¿½H=x!/ ATARI,ï¿½ OBAMA.
BECAUSE THE GAME IS OVER.
SO, REMEMBER KID, WHEN YOU STEP INTO THAT VOTING BOOTH, ASK YOURSELF, WHO DO I LIKE?
THE GUY I LIKE?
OR THE GUY I DON'T LIKE?
