(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AMERICAN
WOMAN WHO BECAME KING OF A
VILLAGE IN GHANA.
EITHER A OR SASHA BARON COHEN IS
SHOOTING A NEW MOVIE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLEASE WELCOME KING PEGGY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOUR MAJESTY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW THIS IS A VEST
VERY INTERESTING STORY WE'LL GET
TO IN JUST A MOMENT BUT FIRST
YOU COULDN'T HAVE DRESSED UP FOR
ME?
>> (LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: IS THIS THE OFFICIAL
CROWN YOU'RE WEARING?
>> YES, IT'S AN OFFICIAL CROWN
I'M WEARING.
IT'S NOT GOLD BECAUSE I CAN'T
TAKE THE GOLD WITH ME RIGHT NOW
>> SO THE GOLD BACK IN GHANA?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOUR FASCINATING
STORY IS IN THE NEW BOOK "KING
PEGGY, AN AMERICAN SECRETARY,
HER ROYAL DESTINY AND THE
INSPIRING STORY OF HOW SHE
CHANGED AN AFRICAN VILLAGE."
FIRST OF ALL, EXPLAIN TO THE
GOOD PEOPLE OF AMERICA-- MY
KINGDOM--
(LAUGHTER)
HOW YOU BECAME... YOU'RE AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN NOW, YOU WERE
BORN IN GONNA.
>> YES.
CITIZEN NOW.
HOW YOU BECAME THE KING OF THIS
VILLAGE?
>> WELL WHEN MY UNCLE PASSED
AWAY THEY DID THE RITUALS AND
THEN I WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE I WAS
THE FIRST WOMAN SO THEY DID IT
THREE TIMES TO MAKE SURE I'M THE
WOMAN THEY WANTED.
>> Stephen: SO HE PASSES AWAY.
DID YOU KNOW HE PASSED AWAY.
>> NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.
THEY CALLED ME AT 4:00 IN THE
MORNING.
THAT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE AFTER
TODAY.
>> Stephen: I WOULD IMAGINE TO
GO FROM SECRETARY TO KING WOULD
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
>> SO IT'S REALLY SPECIAL.
>> Stephen: SO FIRST OF ALL WHY
KING, WHY NOT KING?
>> I'D BE A LOUSY QUEEN BECAUSE
THE KING IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN
CHARGE OF ALL THE EXECUTIVE
POSITIONS BUT IF I BECOME A
QUEEN, I'D HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE
KING BECAUSE I'D HAVE TO COLLECT
ALL THE DATA FROM THE TOWN AND
THEN TALK TO THE KING ABOUT IT
AND THE KING DOESN'T REALLY WORK
ON IT I WOULD DO EVERYTHING.
>> Stephen: SO THERE'S A QUEEN
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.
>> YES, YES, YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S SHE LIKE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> SHE'S OKAY.
>> Stephen: IS SHE A BIT OF A
DRAMA QUEEN?
>> (LAUGHS)
>> Stephen: YOU GET ALONG?
>> YES, WE DO GET ALONG.
>> Stephen: SO LET'S GO BACK TO
HOW YOU WERE CHOSEN.
SO HE PASSES ON, THEY DO A
RITUAL WHERE THEY... WHERE DO
THEY GO FOR THIS RITUAL?
>> THEY GO TO ANCESTORS AND POUR
LIBATIONS.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S IS THIS LIE
BRAGS?
>> IT'S SCHNAPPS.
>> Stephen: SO IN GHANA THEY
POUR THIS NAPS ON THE GROUND TO
FIND THEIR KING?
THE ANCIENT AFRICAN SCHNAPPS?
WHY SCH NAPPS?
>> IN THE ANCIENT DAYS THE
PEOPLE GAVE THEM SCHNAPPSS.
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
>> THEY POUR IT ON THE GROUND
AND IT THESE STEAM UP.
>> Stephen: AND IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT YOU WAKE UP AND WHAT
DO THEY SAY IN
>> THEY SAY YOU ARE A KING FOR
ALL TIME RIGHT NOW.
WHICH WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT
I WASN'T EXPECTING AND I WAS
REALLY HAPPY THAT I WAS CHOSEN
BECAUSE FOR A SECRETARY TO BE A
KING, NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO
BE A KING.
>> NO, THAT IS... I HOPE YOU'RE
HOLDING ON THE THE MOVIE RIGHTS
TO THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHO WOULD BE GREAT?
QUEEN LATIFAH AS KING PEGGY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FANTASTIC.
IT'S A NATURAL.
>> THAT WOULD BE NICE!
>> Stephen: HOW BIG IS THIS
VILLAGE?
>> WE HAVE ABOUT 7,000 PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: AND AS KING WHAT DO
YOU HOPE THE DO?
>> AT THE MOMENT... WHEN I WENT
THERE THE TOWN WAS IN A MESS.
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM WITH
THE HELP FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE
UNITED STATES BY GOING TO
www.kingpeggy.com AND THEY HELP
US TO BRING WATER.
WHEN I TOOK OVER THERE WAS NO
CLEAN WATER AND I'M TRYING TO
RAISE FUNDS TO HAVE AN AMBULANCE
FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
AN AMBULANCE AND MOST OF THE
TIME THE PEOPLE DIE ALONG THE
WAY WHEN THEY TRY TO TAKE PEOPLE
FOR MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE A GOOD
KING?
>> I'M A VERY GOOD KING.
I'M VERY GOOD KING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO CHOOSING YOUR
LEADER BY POURING SCHNAPPS ON
THE GROUND SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY
EFFECTIVE ELECTORAL SYSTEM.
DO YOU THINK WE CAN USE THAT IN
THE UNITED STATES?
WOULD YOU TEAM WILL?
BECAUSE...
>> WELL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO
DIFFERENT CULTURES.
>> Stephen: THOUGH WE DRINK A
FAIR AMOUNT OF SCHNAPPS OVER
HERE, TOO.
>> THIS ISN'T PEPPER MEANT
SCHNAPPSS.
THIS IS REAL.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT LIKE?
>> IT TASTES WONDERFUL.
>> Stephen: DOES IT TASTE
WONDERFUL RIGHT AWAY OR AFTER?
(LAUGHTER)
