BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THERE AREPEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WILL
CONTINUE TO TELL YOU THATHILLARY CLINTON'S AMBITIONS ARE
NOT TIED TO THE SCANDAL INBENGHAZI, BUT HERE'S A
COINCIDENCE: I'M ABOUT TO TALKABOUT HER.
[LAUGHTER]HILLARY CLINTON, IS SHE RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT?
WELL, DON'T ASK HER.
>> I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND.
I'M GOING TO DECIDE WHEN ITFEELS RIGHT FOR ME TO DECIDE.
I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: SHE DOESN'T KNOW.
ALL SHE KNOWS IS SHE'S DOINGTOWN HALLS ON HER NATIONWIDE
BOOK TOUR WITH A GIANT BUS THATSAYS, "READY FOR HILLARY."
IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING.
[LAUGHTER]BUT IF HILLARY CLINTON DOES RUN,
SHE'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT.
SHE HAS NAME RECOGNITION.
SHE HAS EXPERIENCE AND TWO XCHROMOSOMES, AND THAT'S REALLY
GOING TO HELP IN THOSE PARTS OFTHE COUNTRY THAT HAVE WOMEN.
FOLKS, I AM NOT WORRIED BECAUSETHE G.O.P. HAS A NEW WEAPON TO
TAKE HER DOWN.
>> HILLARY CLINTON'S PRECAMPAIGNBOOK TOUR ARRIVED IN D.C. AND
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONALCOMMITTEE WELCOMED HER WITH
RIDICULE IN THE FORM OF A GIANTSQUIRREL ASKING CLINTON
SUPPORTERS, "ANOTHER CLINTONWHITE HOUSE: ARE YOU NUTS?"
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
A GIANT SQUIRREL.
BECAUSE SURE, CLINTON'S GONETOE-TO-TOE WITH SOME OF THE
TOUGHEST MEN ON THE PLANET, BUTHAS SHE EVER TAKEN ON A
MAN-SIZED RODENT ARMED WITHPUNS?
I THINK NUT.
AND THE SQUIRREL HERE HAS BEENGOING AFTER HILLARY WITH TWEET
ZINGERS LIKE, "HILLARY CLINTONIS SQUIRRELY IF SHE THINKS THE
TALIBAN AREN'T A THREAT TO US"AND "HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING
TO HIDE HER RECORD ON BENGHAZITHE WAY I HIDE ACORNS."
WOW.
THOSE ARE SOME STINGING NUTPUNS.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE.
CASHEW BELIEVE SHE'S RUNNING?
HILLARY PE-CAN'T BE OUR NEXTPRESIDENT.
WE NEED A BORDER WAL-NUT.
REMEMBER, SHE MURDERED VINCEFOSTER.
PISTACHIO.
NATION, THIS IS THE BEST USE OFA MASCOT IN POLITICS SINCE
STEPHEN DOUGLAS DRESSED UP ASA BANANA AND SAID LINCOLN WAS
UNAPPEALING. AND THIS BRAND-NEWIDEA TO ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON
WILL DEFINITELY WORK BECAUSE ITIS ACTUALLY A BRAND-OLD IDEA TO
ATTACK OBAMA THAT DID NOT WORK.
YOU SEE, BACK IN 2008, TOSHOWCASE OBAMA'S INVOLVEMENT
WITH ACORN, THE SQUIRREL MADEAPPEARANCES WAVING BEHIND CHRIS
MATTHEWS ON MSNBC AND DANCING ATDEMOCRATIC PRESS CONFERENCES IN
OHIO BEFORE BEING KICKED OUT BYTHE POLICE.
EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED, ESPECIALLYHIS FRIEND, THE CHIPMUNK.
AND YET SIX YEARS LATER, THEREARE STILL A FEW DETAILS ABOUT
THE SQUIRREL THEY HAVEN'TWORKED OUT.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NAME OF THESQUIRREL IS STILL TBD.
FOLKS, I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MYMIND THAT REPUBLICANS WILL COME
UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY FUNNYLIKE THEY DID WITH REINCE
PREIBUS.
[LAUGHTER]NOW, THIS SQUIRREL HAS BEEN
FOLLOWING CLINTON FOR A WEEK,AND A SPOKESMAN FOR THE RNC
PROMISES THAT WE'RE GOING TO DOIT FOR AS LONG AS IT WORKS.
AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR WHENEVERTHAT STARTS.
BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE SQUIRRELWAS THE VICTIM OF A SNEAK
ATTACK.
>> HELLO, MR. SQUIRREL.
HOW ARE YOU?
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING MEAROUND.
WHILE YOU'RE IN BETWEEN YOURGIGS, I WANTED YOU TO GET A COPY
OF MY BOOK. I HOPE YOU WILL MAKETHE HARD CHOICE AND READ MY
BOOK. BUT YOU BRING A SMILE TO ALOT OF PEOPLE'S FACES.
THANK YOU, MR. SQUIRREL.
[APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: SHE MADE FRIENDS
WITH HIM.
HE WAS SO RATTLED THAT HE LATERTWEETED, "THANK YOU, HILLARY
CLINTON.
I LOVE FICTION."
COME ON, SQUIRREL.
YEAH, THAT'S A DIG AT HILLARY,BUT THERE'S NOT ONE NUT PUN IN
THERE.
WHAT ABOUT, "THANKS, HILLARY,BUT IF I WANTED TO READ A LOT OF
BOOKS, I WOULD HAVE ENTEREDMACADAMIA."
OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY HILLARY'SJUST TOO TOUGH TO BE TAKEN DOWN
BY ONE RECYCLED MASCOT.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST TWORECYCLED MASCOTS.
SO TONIGHT IN SUPPORT OF THERNC, I AM RE-PURPOSING THE
COLBERT REPORT'S OLD MASCOT,McGNAW THE GLUTEN-FREE BEAVER.
COME ON IN, McGNAW.
>> HI.
HI, EVERYBODY!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: McGNAW,
McGNAW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORCOMING BACK, BUDDY.
>> MY PLEASURE, STEPHEN.
THIS BEAVER IS EAGER TO DOIT. YAY!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: NOW PREVIOUSLY
YOU'VE EDUCATED KIDS ABOUT THEDANGERS OF GLUTEN AND CELIAC
DISEASE.
>> YEP, KIDS, LISTEN TO YOURFRIEND McGNAW, DON'T EAT
BREAD, EAT WOOD INSTEAD.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, THOUGH KIDS,TO BE CLEAR, IN THIS EXAMPLE,
WOOD IS A METAPHOR FOR FRUITSAND VEGETABLES.
>> OR WOOD.
>> Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON.
McGNAW, ARE YOU PREPARED TOJOIN MR. SQUIRREL AND TAKE ON
HILLARY CLINTON?
>> YOU BET.
I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUTHER DECISION TO VOTE FOR THE WAR
IN IRAQ.
>> Stephen: LIKE?
>> LIKE WHY DID SHE VOTE FOR IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PEPPERTHAT WITH SOME BEAVER PUNS.
>> LIKE WHAT?
>> Stephen: LIKE IF SHE HAD TODO IT OVER, "WOOD" SHE "CHEWS"
TO DO IT AGAIN?
HUH?
[APPLAUSE]>> I DON'T KNOW, STEPHEN.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATEFOR THE GRAVITY OF THIS SUBJECT.
I WAS READING AN ARTICLE IN"PRO-PUBLICA," AND I'M TROUBLED
BY THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTONDIDN'T EVEN READ THE NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE BEFOREVOTING TO COMMIT TROOPS TO AN
OPEN-ENDED CONFLICT IN THEMIDDLE EAST.
>> Stephen: "DAM."
THAT'S A SCARY "TAIL," BEAVER.
>> WHY AM I HERE, IS IT BECAUSEI'M A BEAVER YOU ALREADY HAD
ON STAFF OR DO YOU REALLY WANTSOME ANSWERS.
>> Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTANDWHY YOU WON'T DO ANY BEAVER
PUNS.
>> THE PUNS ARE FOR KIDS.
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO ASKQUESTIONS TO AN ADULT WOMAN WHO
CAN ASCEND TO THE HIGHEST OFFICEIN THE LAND.
I THINK PUNS ARE A LITTLEBENEATH MY DIGNITY AS A
JOURNALIST, AND THEY SHOULD BEBENEATH YOUR DIGNITY, TOO.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO.
HE'S RIGHT.
I'M SORRY, McGNAW.
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THATIMPORTANT TO YOU.
>> WELL, I'M NOT JUST AONE-TRICK BEAVER.
I'M TRYING TO BRANCH OUT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: LIKE A TREE BRANCH?
>> ALL RIGHT, [BLEEPED] YOU,MAN, [BLEEPED] YOU.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: McGNAW, THE
GLUTEN-FREE BEAVER, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
McGNAW, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
