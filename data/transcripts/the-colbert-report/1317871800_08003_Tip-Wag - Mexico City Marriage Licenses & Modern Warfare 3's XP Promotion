[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NATION... THE BIBLE SAYS JUDGE
NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED.
BUT WHAT IF I WANT TO BE JUDGED
ON HOW GOOD A JUDGE I AM?
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
FIRST UP, A SHOCKING NEW
PROPOSAL OUT OF MEXICO.
FOR MORE WE GO TO SAN FRANCISCO
KPIX, MEXICO CITY'S NEW LEADER.
>> A NEW WAY TO AVOID THE
HASSLES OF DIVORCE IN MEXICO
CITY.
CITY LEADERS HAVE INTRODUCED A
PROPOSAL FOR TEMPORARY MARRIAGE
LICENSES.
GET THIS.
THE CONTRACT LASTS TWO YEARS.
THE MARRIED COUPLES CAN RENEW
THE LICENSE IF THEY'RE STILL
HAPPY AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD.
OTHERWISE THEY CAN SPLIT UP AND
THE CONTRACT COVERS HOW THEY
DIVVY UP PROPERTY AND KIDS.
>> Stephen: TWO YEARS.
THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMITMENT OF
YOUR LIFE IS NOW LESS BINDING
THAN A VERIZON CELL PHONE
CONTRACT.
SO A WAG OF MY FINGER AT MEXICO
CITY.
MEXICO CITY, MARRIAGE IS A
SACRED INSTITUTION THAT SHOULD
LAST FOREVER BECAUSE ONCE YOU
HAVE MADE THAT ETERNAL
COMMITMENT, YOU CAN LET YOURSELF
GO.
I MEAN, JUST THROW ON THE
SWEATPANTS AND CANCEL YOUR GYM
MEMBERSHIP.
YOU CAN LET YOUR ASS GET ITS OWN
ZIP CODE, LET YOUR EARS GO
UNPLUCKED, EAT ON THE TOILET.
OKAY.
THAT'S A TIME SAVER.
AND A TWO-YEAR COMMITMENT?
THAT'S A CONGRESSIONAL TERM,
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE REALLY ONLY
MARRIED FOR ONE YEAR BECAUSE
YOUR SECOND YEAR YOU'RE
CAMPAIGNING TO BE REELECTED
SPOUSE.
WHAT IF YOU FACE A PRIMARY
CHALLENGER WITH MORE
CROWD-PLEASING AMBASSADOR OR A
BOLDER VISION FOR SHARED
HOUSEWORK?
YOUR LAWN WOULD BE CLUTTERED
WITH CAMPAIGN POSTERS, JOSE
MARTINEZ WILL SWIFFER UNDER THE
COUCH, JOSE MARTINEZ FOR
HUSBAND.
NO WAY, MEXICO, MARRIAGE IS
CALLED THE BALL AND CHAIN, NOT
THE BALL AND VELCRO STRAP.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, THEY GET IT.
FOLKS, I AM SUPER PUMPED FOR THE
UPCOMING RELEASE OF "CALL OF
DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 3."
IT LETS YOU BRO BLOW UP THE
STREETS OF PARIS, LONDON AND
BERLIN.
YOU'LL DESTROY SO MUCH OF EUROPE
YOU'LL THINK YOU'RE THE GREEK
ECONOMY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THE BIG NEWS, THE BIG NEWS
IS "CALL OF DUTY'S" PROMOTION
WHERE JUST BY BUYING MOUNTAIN
DEW AND DORITO, PLAYERS CAN
REDEEM CODES IN THE PACKAGING
FOR DOUBLE EXPERIENCE TIME,
WHICH GIVES YOU MORE WEAPONS,
MORE PERKS, MORE ATTACHMENT,
MORE KILL STREAKS.
AND HOPEFULLY MORE WORDS LIKE
"KILL STREAK."
WHY NOT "SLAUGHTER STRINGS" AND
"MURDER SWEEPS.
" IT'S A GAME FOR KIDS, PLEASE.
SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO CALL OF
DUTY FOR LETTING THE FREE MARKET
DECIDE WHO IS THE BEST GAMER.
WHY SPEND HOURS AND HOURS
BUILDING UP YOUR SKILLS WHEN YOU
CAN REACH THE SAME SCORES JUST
BY FILLING UP YOUR DORITO HOLES?
THESE FREE EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE
GREAT BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS
BELIEVED THAT VIDEO GAMES ARE
NOT LAZY ENOUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
SITTING AND PRESSING BUTTONS,
WHAT AM I, A MACHINE?
BUT SOME FLAVA HATERS OUT THERE
ARE COMPLAINING WHO USE THE
SNACK-BOUGHT XP POINTS HAVE A
DISTINCT ADVANTAGE OVER THOSE
WHO DON'T BECAUSE THEY CAN REACH
HIGHER LEVELS WITHOUT ACQUIRING
GAMING SKILLS.
WELL, I SAY THIS PROMOTION
TEACHES KIDS A VALUABLE LESSON
THAT ANYTHING WORTH ACHIEVING
THROUGH HARD WORK YOU CAN ALSO
JUST BUY.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR INSTANCE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I FOR ONE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR A COLLEGE
DEGREE ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED
ENOUGH SNAPPLE CAPS.
FOR INSTANCE, A QUEEN BEE CAN
LAY 1,500 EGGS A DAY.
