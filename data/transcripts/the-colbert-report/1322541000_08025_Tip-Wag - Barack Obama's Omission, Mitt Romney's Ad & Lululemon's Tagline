>> Stephen: NATION, I DON'T
JUST PASS JUDGEMENT, I LEAN
ON THE HORN AND FLIP IT THE
BIRD.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG
OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, FOLKS, THIS YEAR
THANKSGIVING WAS RUINED.
AND THIS TIME IT WASN'T
BECAUSE OF THAT HORRIBLE
THING YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID
IN FRONT OF YOUR KOREAN
GIRLFRIEND.
NO, THIS YEAR THANKSGIVING
WAS RUINED BECAUSE IN HIS
THANKSGIVING DAY INTERNET
ADDRESS BARACK OBAMA DID NOT
THANK GOD.
COME ON!
IT IS THANKSGIVING, WITHOUT
DOES HE THINKS WE'RE
THANKSING OTHER THAN
DR. HEIMLICH.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M
GIVING A WAG OF MY GRAVY
STAINED FINGER TO PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
SIR, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE
FIRST THAX GIVING WHEN THE
PILGRIMS AND THE INDIANS AND
THE JESUS SAT DOWN TOGETHER
AND THE LORD DID TURN THE
MAIZE INTO CORN AND LO HE
GAVETTE THE INDIAN SMALLPOX
FOR NOT BELIEVING IN HIM.
AND SO I AM CALL ON THE
PRESIDENT TO RECOGNIZE
THANKSGIVING AS A RELIGIOUS
HOLIDAY.
COMMEMORATING THE MIRACLE OF
WHEN JESUS ROSE FROM THE
COUCH FOR YET ANOTHER SLICE
OF PIE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, THIS
YEAR THE THING I'M MOST
THANKFUL FOR IS MITT ROMNEY,
WHO GETS A TELEPHONE OF MY
HAT FOR HIS NEW AD WHICH
NAILS BARACK OBAMA USING
OBAMA'S OWN WORDS.
>> I AM CONFI DIDN'T THAT WE
CAN STEER OURSELVES OUT OF
THIS --
>> WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE
ECONOMY.
>> WE NEED A RESCUE PLAN FOR
THE MIDDLE CLASS.
WE NEED PROVIDE RELIEF FOR
HOMEOWNERS.
>> IF ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE
A NEW DIRECTION.
>> IF WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT
THE ECONOMY, WE'RE GOING TO
LOSE, LOSE, LOSE.
>> Stephen: BUSTED.
IF HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT
THE ECONOMY, OBAMA'S GOING
TO LOSE.
OF COURSE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
CLAIMING THAT OBAMA IS NOT
TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY QUOTE
FROM 2080 WAS TAKEN OUT OF
CONTEXT IN THE TECHNICALITY
THAT IT WAS.
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL.
>> SENATOR McCAIN'S CAMPAIGN
ACTUALLY SAID, AND I QUOTE,
IF WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE
ECONOMY, WE'RE GOING TO LOSE.
>> Stephen: NOW SURE, HOLD
ON, HOLD ON, THAT MAY LOOK
LIKE AN UNFAIR EDIT BY
ROMNEY BUT LATER, I WILL
EDIT THIS SO THAT IT
DOESN'T.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND FOLKS, I AM
HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR
OF NO APOLOGY, MITT ROMNEY,
IS NOT GOING TO APOLOGY.
HE EXPLAINED THIS OUT OF
CONTEXT EDIT IN ONE SENTENCE.
>> WHAT'S SAUCE FOR THE
GOOSE IS NOW SAUCE FOR THE
GANDER.
>> Stephen: YES, SAUCE FOR
THE GOOSE IS NOW SAUCE FOR
THE GANDER.
AND IT DOES NOT MATTER IF
THE GANDER THAT THE GOOSE IS
TALKING ABOUT WAS QUOTING AN
OLD DUCK.
THE POINT IS
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: COULD HAVE HAD
HIM.
THE POINT IS THOSE WORDS
CAME OUT OF OBAMA'S FACE.
NOW THEY'RE HIS WORDS.
I MEAN JUST LIKE SOME OF MY
MOST FAMOUS QUOTES ASK NOT
WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR
YOU, ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR
YOUR COUNTRY, NOW MINE.
LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THY
SELF, I OWN IT.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY
FOR THIS JELLY, MY BODY'S
TOO BOOTYLICIOUS FOR YOU
BABE.
I OWN ALL THOSE WORDS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I OWN
THOSE WORDS NOW JUST AS
SURELY AS I OWN ALL THE
WORDS IN MY NEW AUDIO BOOK
NO APOLOGY BY STEPHEN
COLBERT.
BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS
ROYALTIES FOR THE GOOSE ARE
NOW GOING TO BE ROYALTIES
FOR THE GANDER.
AND FINALLY, FOLKS, YOU KNOW
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF
YOGA.
IF I WANTED TO SPEND ALL DAY
ON THE GROUND SWEATING IN A
CONTORTED POSITION, I WOULD
EAT ANOTHER GAS STATION HOT
DOG.
BUT WORSE, FOLKS, WORSE,
YOGA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ITS
EXERCISE CHOICE FOR
LIBERALS.
BUT TONIGHT I'M LEAP TO SAY
THERE IS ONE CONSERVATIVE
YOGIC MIND OUT THERE I CAN
GET BEHIND.
THAT IS WHY I'M GIVING A BIG
TIP OF MY HAT TO YOGA
CLOTHING STORE LULU LEMON
WHICH IS NOW OFFERING
SHOPPING BAGS WITH THE QUOTE,
WHO IS JOHN GALT, A
CATCH-PHRASE FROM THE AYN
RAND NOVEL ATLAS SHRUG WHICH
CELEBRATES THE PURSUIT OF
RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST, FREE
MARKET DOMINATION AND STANCH
OPPOSITION TO BIG GOVERNMENT
MISGUIDED DESIRE TO AID THE
HOPELESSLY PARASITIC MASSES,
YOU KNOW, YOGA.
AND-- TYING YOGA WITH
RATIONAL EGOISM MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.
I MEAN WHO CAN FORGET AYN
RAND'S BEST SELLING WORKOUT
VIDEO, SWEATING AWAY THE
EMPATHY.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, WITH LULU-LEMON'S
ENDORSEMENT IT WON'T BE LONG
UNTIL AYN RAND'S PHILOSOPHY
MAKES ITS WAY INTO YOGA
CLASSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND WE START SEEING NEW
POSES LIKE LOOKING DOWNWARD
ON OTHERS DOGS, GOVERNMENT
DEREGULATING COBRA, AND BEND
OVER AND TAKE IT FROM THE
