MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW MOVIE
OPENING THIS FRIDAY, "THE EXTRA
MAN."
JIM.
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN TEACHING NOW
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
>> SO AS FAR AS THE RENT IS
CONCERNED, I'VE SAVED ENOUGH
FROM WORKING AT PRINCETON TO...
>> PRINCETON?
HOW IS PRINCETON THESE DAYS?
IT WAS GREAT ONCE, BUT THEN THEY
LET WOMEN IN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> OH, YOU MEAN THE UNIVERSITY.
IT'S STILL EXCELLENT.
>> I'M AGAINST THE EDUCATION OF
WOMEN.
IT DULLES THEIR SEXES SENSES AND
AFFECTS THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE
BOUDOIRE.
THE HASIDIC WOMEN, THEY REALLY
GET IT.
>> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME
KEVIN KLINE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> HEY, MR. COASTLINE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
HUGE FAN.
>> THANK YOU, AS AM I.
>> Stephen:, SIR, IT'S GREAT
TO HAVE YOU ON.
AS I SAID, I'M A HUGE FAN, BUT I
HAVE A BEEF TO PICK WITH YOU, I
HAVE A BEEF TO PICK OFF THE
BONE, AS IT WERE.
IN THIS MOVIE, THE EXTRA MAN,
YOU PLAY AN ESCORT, CORRECT?
>> WELL, THAT TERM HAS A
DEROGATORY SORT OF RESONANCE TO
IT.
I'M NOT REALLY AN ESCORT THE WAY
WE THINK OF ESCORTS.
I'M A COMPANION.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A
COMPANION.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH IT.
YOU ARE AN ESCORT, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE SEX WITH THE WOMEN THAT YOU
ESCORT.
>> NOT ON SCREEN.
>> Stephen: NOT ON SCREEN, NO,
TRUE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THAT'S A GOOD THING.
>> Stephen: THAT I BELIEVE
DESTROYS THE TRADITIONAL
SANCTITY OF PROSTY TIEWTS.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU GET PAID... IF MAN GETS
PAID TO BE WITH A WOMAN, IT
SHOULDN'T BE FOR SHOWING HIS
EMOTIONS.
IT SHOULD BE FOR TAGGING THAT
THING.
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: NOW, THE MAN IN
THIS MOVIE, HE'S TRADITIONAL,
ISN'T HE?
>> HE'S FROM A BY GONE ERA WHERE
GENTLEMEN WERE GENTLEMEN AND
WOMEN WERE UNEDUCATED.
>> Stephen: HE HAS A VERY
DRAMATIC FLAIR?
>> YES, HE'S MAN OF THE THEATER.
HE'S A PLAYWRIGHT.
HE USED TO BE AN ACTOR.
>> Stephen: TYPECASTING?
>> I USED TO BE AN ACTOR, TOO.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE AN ACTOR.
YOU ARE A THEATER ACTOR.
>> I DO FILM OCCASIONALLY, AS
WELL.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ALMOST
FAMOUS FOR TURNING DOWN ROLES.
THEY CALL YOU KEVIN DECLINE,
RIGHT?
NOT MY STATEMENT.
THAT HAS BEEN CALLED?
>> YES.
WE ALL HAVE TO TURN DOWN
SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: I TURN NOTHING
DOWN.
>> REALLY?
>> Stephen: NEW YORK OFFER IT
TO ME, ANDLY DO IT.
ANYONE WHO IS WATCHING WITH A
FILM, I'M IN.
YOU DO THEATER.
YOU DO A LOT OF THEATER.
>> I NEVER TURN DOWN THEATER.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A GIANT OF
THE AMERICAN STAGE.
>> WELL...
>> Stephen: WHO WERE YOU IN
LION KING?
>> I WAS THIRD ROW ON THE AISLE.
>> Stephen: YOU'D MAKE AN
EXCELLENT PUMBA.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW IT'S VERY
IMPORTANT FOR ME, I ASK ALL MY
GUESTS, I ASK DAVID MAMET MY
QUESTION, THEATER, E-R OR R-E,
HOW YOU SPELL IT AT THE END.
>> I SPELL IT R-E.
>> Stephen: WELL, WELCOME TO
AMERICA, SIR.
IT'S E-R.
IT'S NOT FRANCE.
YOU'RE KNOWN FOR YOUR GREAT
STAGE PROMINENCE, BUT I WILL NOT
BE OUTNUNSUATED BY YOU.
NO, KEV-NKLIIIIN.
STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> A MINUTE OR TWO TO TWO.
IT'S HARDER STILL TO DO.
MEET ME AT 20 TO 2.
A MINUTE OR TWO TO DO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: A LITTLE BIT.
I MISSED ONE OF THE TA TO THE
TO-DOS.
>> YOU SOUNDED DUH.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE KNOWN TO BE
A SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR.
>> I'M KNOWN TO BE MANY THINGS.
>> Stephen: FOR THE PURPOSES
OF THE NEXT 30 SECOND, YOU'RE
KNOWN TO BE A SHAKESPEAREAN
ACTOR.
>> ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
>> Stephen: I CHALLENGE DO YOU
ACT SHAKESPEARE WITHOUT YOUR
CRUTCH OF WORDS AND YOUR PAN AM
THER THE.
SHAKESPEARE WITH ONLY YOUR FACE
AND A GRUNT.
I WILL BEGIN.
LEAR, LEAR, THE KING.
>> LEAR, YES.
>> Stephen:, NO NORMAN LEAR.

[LAUGHTER]
WANTED ON THE SURE.
