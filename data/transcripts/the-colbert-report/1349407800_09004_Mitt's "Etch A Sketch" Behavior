THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
>> Stephen: PRETTY MUCH CAPTURES IT.
NOW OF COURSE A LOT OF BELLY ACRES ON THE LEFT, INCIDENTALLY BELLYACHING NOT COVERED UNDER ROMNEY'S PLAN,
INSISTED ON PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WORDS THEY SAID, AND POINTED OUT THAT MITT CHANGING ALMOST ALL OF HIS
POSITIONS COULD BACKFIRE.
LIKE THIS FROM NPR.
ROMNEY GOES ON OFFENSE.
PAYS FOR IT IN FIRST WAVE OF FACT CHECKS.
OH NO!
MITT COULD LOSE THE FACT CHECKING RACE.
QUICK, SOME FACT CHECKER SHOULD RESEARCH HOW MANY ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THE SWING STATE OF FACT CHECKELSVANNIA HAS.
BECAUSE-- BECAUSE I THINK-- I THINK-- I THINK IT'S EVEN FEWER THAN NORTH I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP].
FOLKS, THE FACT CHECK MAFIA IS JUST A BET BECAUSE ROMNEY WON BY PIVOTING.
EXACTLY LIKE HIS SENIOR ADVISOR ERIC FERNSTROM SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO AFTER THE PRIMARY.
>> EVERYTHING CHANGES.
IF IS ALMOST LIKE AN ETCH-A-SKETCH, YOU CAN KIND OF SHAPE IT UP-- SHAKE IT UP AND WE START ALL OVER AGAIN.
>> Stephen: AND EVERYONE AGREES LAST NIGHT MITT WAS PRETTY SKETCHY.
>> HE SAID THINGS THAT WERE JUST NOT ACCURATE.
>> MITT ROMNEY PRESENTED WITH US THE ULTIMATE ETCH-A-SKETCH BEHAVIOR LAST NIGHT.
>> ROMNEY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ETCH-A-SKETCH.
LAST NIGHT WAS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT.
>> Stephen: LET ME SHOW YOU JUST HOW GREAT AN ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS.
BEFORE THE DEBATE, MITT'S CAMPAIGN SAID ROMNEY WILL COME ACROSS AS EMPATHETIC.
BUT HERE'S WHAT MITT HAS BEEN PROMISING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.
>> TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.
HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT SEEM WARM AND FUZZY?
WELL, YOU JUST NEED TO SHAKE IT UP AS HARD AS MITT DID LAST NIGHT.
>> SO-- GIVE IT A SHOT.
OKAY.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW LET'S SEE WHAT MITT'S TAX PLAN LOOKS LIKE NOW.
OKAY?
JUST NEED TO GET MY TOOL HERE.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PRESTO CHANGEO.
(LAUGHTER) NOW YOU SEE ROMNEY'S POLICIES, NOW YOU DON'T.
WE'LL BE RI
