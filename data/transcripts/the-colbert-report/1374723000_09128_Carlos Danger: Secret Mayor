OKAY.
THAT'S IT, FOLKS.
I JUST... I DON'T CARE WHAT HIS
WIFE THINKS.
THESE ARE SERIOUS TIMES.
THIS CITY HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS.
AND I DO NOT WANT ANTHONY WEINER
AS MY MAYOR.
I WANT CARLOS DANGER.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
CARLOS DANGER.
A MAN OF WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE
OF MYSTERY IS.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS.
A YEAR AFTER BEING HOUNDED FROM
OFFICE IN NATIONAL, NAY, GLOBAL
DISGRACE FOR RECREATIONAL CROTCH
PHOTOGRAPHY, DOES HE STOP?
NO, HE PRESSES ON.
THAT'S THE KIND OF SINGLE-MINDED
DEDICATION YOU NEED AS MAYOR OF
NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE AS MAYOR
CARLOS DANGER WILL FACE
IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGES EVERY DAY.
BUT HE WON'T JUST THROW UP HIS
HANDS BECAUSE THOSE HANDS WILL
ALWAYS BE OCCUPIED.
PLUS LET'S FACE IT.
YOU WANT TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT,
SAY NO MORE.
AND MAYOR DANGER WOULD NEVER BE
SCARED TO GO TOE-TO-"I HOPE
THAT'S A TOE" WITH WALL STREET
OR TEACHERS' UNIONS OR THE MOB.
HE'S NOT SCARED OF ANYTHING
BECAUSE CARLOS DANGER'S MIDDLE
NAME IS ALSO DANGER.
OF COURSE, WE CAN'T EXPECT
CARLOS DANGER TO SING HIS OWN
PRAISES.
HE'S A HUMBLE GUY UNLESS YOU'RE
A IMPRESSIONABLE YOUNG WOMAN
WITH A SMART PHONE.
SO TONIGHT MY GRAPHICS TEAM HAS
CREATED AN ANIMATED TRIBUTE TO
WHAT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW YORK
CAN EXPECT UNDER THE DANGER
ADMINISTRATION.
JIM?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> I'LL SAVE YOU.
CARLOS DANGER.
SECRET MAYOR.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THIS NOVEMBER
, I CERTAINLY HOPE
YOU'LL BE THINKING OF CARLOS
DANGER WHEN YOU YANK THAT LEVER.
NOW, IN OTHER POLITICAL NEWS,
FOLKS, YESTERDAY VIRGINIA
GOVERNOR BOB McDONNELL
APOLOGIZED FOR ACCEPTING
$120,000 IN INAPPROPRIATE LOANS
FROM A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT MAKER
WHO ALSO FUNDED A $15,000 NEW
YORK SHOPPING TRIP FOR THE
GOVERNOR'S WIFE.
AND... ANY PICS OF HIS PEENER OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
THEN WHY AM I WASTING YOUR TIME?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
