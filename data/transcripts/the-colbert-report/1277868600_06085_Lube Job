EVERYBODY.
NATION, I GOT TO TELL YOU, JUST
READING NEWS ABOUT THE OIL SPILL
IS SO DEPRESSING.
THE FRONT PAGE IS A PICTURE OF
AN OILY PELICAN.
THE BIDS SECTION TRACKS THE LOSS
OF GULF JOBS.
IT'S EVEN AFFECTED THE
HOROSCOPES.
I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT PISCES.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOLKS, TELEVISION NEWS IS
THE WORST.
>> A BABY DOLPHIN COVERED IN OIL
WAS FOUND ON A SANDBAR OFF
PENSACOLA BEACH.
IT LATER DIED.
>> Stephen: AFTER RECORDING
THAT, MY TIVO RECOMMENDED THAT I
MIGHT ALSO ENJOY GOUGING MY EYES
OUT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE'S FINALLY SOME GOOD
NEWS, FOLKS.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS ARTICLE.
MUCH OF THE REGION'S BUSINESSES,
PARTICULARLY THE HOTELS, HAVE
BEEN PROSPERING BECAUSE SO MANY
PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE FROM B.P.
AND OTHER OIL EMERGENCY RESPONSE
TEAMS.
SEE, THE CORAL REEF MAY BE
DESTROYED, BUT THE TRAVELODGE
ECOSYSTEM HAS NEVER BEEN MORE
VIBRANT.
AND FOLKS, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHERE THIS FEEL-GOOD STORY CAME
FROM, UNLESS YOU GUESS B.P.
SPECIFICALLY "PLANET B.P.," THE
COMPANY'S IN-HOUSE, ONLINE
MAGAZINE.
FOR KIDS THEY HAVE A HIDDEN
PICTURE PAGE WHERE YOU HAVE TO
FIND THE WILDLIFE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S WRITTEN...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT, BUT, I THINK I SAW A
TURTLE.
IT'S WRITTEN BY GUYS LIKE TOM
SESLAR, WHO IDENTIFIES HIMSELF
AS A B.P. REPORTER.
HE BRINGS YOU ALL THE NEWS
THAT'S FIT TO UNDERESTIMATE BY
5050,000 BARRELS.
FOR INSTANCE, TOM FOUND FAMILY
THAT MAY LOSE THEIR SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT BUT WHO SAY THERE IS
NO REASON TO HATE B.P.
THE OIL SPILL WAS AN ACCIDENT.
JUST LIKE THEY COULD
ACCIDENTALLY SPIT INTO THE FOOD
WHEN THE B.P. EXECUTIVES EAT
THERE.
AND THERE'S ANOTHER INTREPID
REPORTER WHO IS TELLING IT LIKE
IT IS.
MORE PLEASANT TO IMAGINE.
PAULA COLMAR, WHO DESCRIBES
WATCHING WORKERS SKIM CRUDE OIL
OFF THE SURFACE OF THE DYING SEA
AS A "SPECTACULAR BALLET AT
SEA."
I ASSUME ""DEAD SWAN LAKE."
BEST OF ALL, FOLKS, THE SMALL
SQUAD OVER AT B.P. HAS STARTED
THEIR OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL.
JIMMY, LET'S DISPERSE A LITTLE
SUNSHINE.
>> THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
ANIMALS WERE OILED, SOME OF THEM
SEEMINGLY HEAVILY, BUT AS YOU
APPROACH, THEY'RE STILL
COMPLETELY CAPABLE OF FLYING.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT BIRDS THAT
ARE STILL VERY VIGOROUS.
THE ININVESTIGATION OF THE OIL
AND THE EVENTUAL EFFECTS WILL
MAKE THEM MORE SLUGGISH AND MORE
CAPTURABLE.
>> COVERING THOSE BIRDS WITH OIL
MAKES THEM EASIER TO CAPTURE SO
WE CAN CLEAN OFF ALL THAT OIL.
IT'S CALLED
♪ THE CIRCLE OF LIFE ♪♪
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO, NO.
DON'T PITY ME.
SO FOR MAKING THESE STORIES THAT
ARE MADE TO FEEL LIKE THE NEWS,
TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I FEEL
