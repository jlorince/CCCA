THING WORSE THAN OBAMA'S WEBSITE IS HIS LACK OF FORESIGHT.
NOW, OUR NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN INCHIEF LOVES SURRENDERING TO
AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND THISWEEKEND HE SENT SECRETARIAT OF
STATE JOHN KERRY TO WAVE THEWHITE FLAG AT IRAN.
>> SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRYIS IN SWITZERLAND TO NEGOTIATE A
POSSIBLE BREAK THROUGH TO FREEZEIRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
>> THE UNITED STATES IS LARGELYLOOKING FOR IRAN TO TAKE THE
FIRST STEP IN CURBING ITSNUCLEAR ACTIVITY.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE HASREPORTEDLY PREPARED TO OFFER THE
IRANIANS LIMITED RELIEF FROMCRIPPLING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IF
THEY AGREE TO TEMPORARILY HALTTHEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR A
PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS.
>> Stephen: SIX MONTHS!
YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITHTERRORISTS THAT LAST SIX
MONTHS-- UNLESS YOU'RE RAISINGTHE DEBT CEILING.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, IRAN IS A NATION OF
RADICAL MUSLIMS HELL BENT ONACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
WE CAN'T HAVE NUKES IN THEMIDDLE EAST.
SOMEONE MIGHT BOMB ISRAEL ANDTHEN THEY'D HAVE TO USE THEIR
NUKES!
(LAUGHTER)FORTUNATELY, THE DEAL WAS
STOPPED BY OUR CLOSEST ALLY.
>> FRANCE SAYS FORGET IT, NODEAL.
>> THE FRENCH JUST SAID LOOK,PAUSE, FORGET IT.
WE WANT TO HALT THE ENTIREPROGRAM.
>> FRANCE WAS THE COUNTRY TOSTAND UP AND SAY NO TO THIS.
THEY SAID THE DEAL WAS TOO EASYON TEHRAN.
>> Stephen: YES, FRANCE!
THE COUNTRY THAT PUT THE OUI IN"WE GIVE UP."

BUTLER IN A GREY POUPON ADLAURIENT FABIUS SAID "THE
AGREEMENT WAS TOO EASY ONTEHRAN.
ONE WANTS A DEAL BUT NOT ASUCKER'S DEAL."
AND, FOLKS, FRANCE KNOW'S ASUCKER'S DEAL.
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SOLD USLOUISIANA.
(LAUGHTER)WE SHOULD HAVE SAVED THE
RECEIPT.
NOW OUR PRESIDENT'S BEENOUTTOUGHED BUT THE FRENCH.
THAT'S LIKE BEING OUTSOBERRED BYTORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD.
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
WE STAND WITH YOU, MR. MAYOR.
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE PRAISINGTHE FRENCH HERE.
ARIZONA SENATOR AND "BOMB, BOMBIRAN" LEAD VOCALIST JOHN
McCAIN TWEETED "FRANCE HAD THECOURAGE TO PREVENT A BAD NUCLEAR
AGREEMENT WITH IRAN.
VIVE LA FRANCE."
UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO HISINEXPERIENCE WITH TWITTER HE
ACCIDENTALLY TYPED THIS INTO HISMICROWAVE.
