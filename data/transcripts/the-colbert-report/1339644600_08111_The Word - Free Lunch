RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE OF THESE SMALL TOWNS.
UNIONS.
THEIR DEMANDS FOR A LIVABLE WAGE AND ACCESSIBLE FIBER EXITS HAVE GUTTED OUR ECONOMY.
( LAUGHTER ) THANKFULLY, PUBLIC SERVICE UNIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING A BEATING.
FIRST THEY, LOST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS IN WISCONSIN.
THEN VOTERS IN BOTH SAN DIEGO AND SAN JOSE CUT WORKERS' RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
INDIANA MADE IT ILLEGAL FOR UNIONS TO MANDATE DUSE FOR WORKERS AND VOTERS IN OZ GUTTED
BENEFITS FOR THE LOLLIPOP GUILD.
WHY AM I PAYING FOR THEIR DIABETES MEDICINE.
ONE UNION SCORED A MAJOR VICTORY AND THAT BRINS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD-- FREE LUNCH.
FOLKS, DESPITE THE NATIONAL TREND AGAINST PUBLIC UNIONS,
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET IT.
TAKE THESE GREEDY SCHOOL CAFETERIA WORKERS IN PENNSYLVANIA.
>> UNION IDES WORKERS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE WON THE RIGHT TO EAT LEFTOVERS UEVEN
WHEN THE FOOD IS EXPIRED.
THE UNION FILED A GRIEVANCE FOR THE RIGHT TO EAT EXPIRED CAFETERIA FOOD FOR FREE.
>> Stephen:  THESE UNIONIZED,
LUNCH LADY THUGS, NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREE EXPIRED CAFETERIA FOOD.
AND GIVEN THE QUALITY OF CAFETERIA FOOD, EXPIRED IS AN IMPROVEMENT.
FOLKS, THE RIGHT FOR WORKERS TO DINE ON OUR CHILDRENNA TABLE SCRAPS IS A HUGE VICTORY FOR THE UNIONS.
I JUST PRAY-- I JUST PRAY OTHER UNIONS, ESPECIALLY PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS, DON'T FORCE US INTO
GIVING THEM THESE KINDS OF OUTRAGEOUS BENEFITS.
WHAT'S NEXT?
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
FIREFIGHTERS?
ARE FIREFIGHTERS DEMANDING THE RIGHT TO PICK THROUGH THE CHARRED REMAINS OF THE HOUSE
THEY JUST PUT OUT?
THEY COULD GET A FREE MELTED BLENDER.
OR-- OR MAYBE UNION COPS HAVING TROUBLE PAYING THEIR MORTGAGES WILL BE DEMANDING THE RIGHT TO
FREE LODGING IN VACANT JAIL CELLS.
THEY'LL ALREADY KNOW THEIR NEIGHBORS.
( LAUGHTER ) AND UNION NURSES COULD WIN THE MOST EXCITING PERK OF ALL-- THEY
COULD WIN-- THEY COULD WIN EXPIRED MEDICINES.
JUST THINK HOW STRONG THE PEN SILLEN WILL BE AFTER IT MOLES A SECOND TIME.
THE POINT IS 100 ARIZONA AGO,
UNIONS USHERED IN THINGS LIKE THE 40-HOUR WORKWEEK, THE WEEKEND, THE END OF THE CHILD
LABOR, AND NOW 100 YEARS ON,
THEY ARE AT IT AGAIN, DEMANDING BENEFITS THAT NONE OF US COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED WANTING IN
OUR WILDEST DREAMS BECAUSE UNLIKE THEIR LUNCH, UNIONS SEEM TO HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
