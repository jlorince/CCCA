[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST WHOSE WRITTEN A NEW BOOK ABOUT CHINA'S
ENTRANCE INTO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.
FIRST CLASS IS NICE, BUT COACH HAS TO BUILD THE PLANE.
PLEASE WELCOME JAMES FALLOWS!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR COME BEGUN BACK.
>> THANK YOU.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE AN AUTHOR ACHE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE ATLANTIC AND YOUR NEW BOOK
IS CALLED "CHINA AIRBORNE." SHOULD I BE THREATENED BY THIS.
EVERY TIME CHINA GETS INTO AN INDUSTRY THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT ABOUT THIS AND LABOR IS CHEAP.
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED IN AMERICA THAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO AYER SPACE?
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD BE INTERESTED.
>> STEPHEN: THE CHINESE SAID MAY YOU LIVE IN INTERESTING TIMES.
>> THE QUESTION YOU RAISE IS ONE THEY ASK THEMSELVES.
THE REASON THEY ARE PUSHING SO HARD IN THIS FIELD, THE REASON I WROTE THE BOOK IS TO TELL THE
STORY OF CHINA I'VE SEEN.
THEY ARE TRYING SO HARD BECAUSE THEY DO IT AS A TEST CASE AS A MATURITY AS A COUNTRY AND
WILLING TO BE A FIRST RATE PLAYER AS THE U.S. IS.
>> STEPHEN: FOUR YEARS AGO B THIS TIME OF YEAR THEY WERE HOSTING THE OLYMPICS.
>> WITHER WE WERE THERE.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE CHINESE MOMENT.
THIS IS THE CHINESE MOMENT ENTERING ON TO THE WORLD STAGE.
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A FANTASTIC SPECTACLE THAT TERRIFIED ME TO THE CORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DID THE SLOWING DOWN OF THE ECONOMY STOP THE CHINESE MOMENT OR ARE THEY STILL ROLL SOMETHING IN.
>> THEY ROLLED AFTER THAT MOMENT.
I SAID I WISH THEY DIDN'T BROADCAST IT OUTSIDE CHINA.
IT WAS GOOD OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD IT GAVE THIS ENTIRELY UNREALISTIC
IMPRESSION OF A COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL COORDINATED COUNTRY WHICH IS NOT THE WAY IT SEEMS
WHEN YOU ARE THERE.
>> STEPHEN: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE 20,000 PEOPLE PLAYING DRUMS TOGETHER.
>> THEY ARE ALL ARMY MEMBERS DRESSED UP AS SCHOLARS OR WHATEVER.
MOST PEOPLE IN BEIJING SAID MY GOD THEY PULLED IT OFF.
EVERYTHING ELSE.
WE WENT TO SEAT CREW RACE AT THE OLYMPICS THE NEXT DAY.
THEY HADN'T PLANNED OUT FOR THE ROUTE OF BICYCLE RACE S CROSSING THE BUS ROUTE.
YOU TOOK TWO HOURS OF WAITING FOR THE BICYCLE RACE TO PASS.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S TALK ABOUT CHINESE -- ARE THERE CHINESE AIRLINES OR CHINESE AIRPLANE
MANUFACTURING THAT EXISTS NOW?
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF AIRLINES NOW.
THEY ARE GROWING LIKE CRAZY AND TRYING VERY HARD TO GET TO THE AIRCRAFT BUSINESS.
THEY HAVE THEIR SO CALLED AIRCRAFTS.
THEY BOUGHT AN AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL MAKER.
THEY BOUGHT A PLANE ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
>> STEPHEN: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRAG YOU OWN A PLANE, OKAY.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY AUDI AGAIN.
>> IT'S A CHINA-MADE PLANE THOUGH.
>> STEPHEN: CHINESE-MADE PLANE.
WHAT IS IS FLYING IN CHINA LIKE?
>> MORE PLEASANT THAN THE U.S.
THE FLYING IS ALL NEW.
THERE'S HOT FEELS, THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE RECENTLY HIRED,
BASICALLY IN THEIR 20s AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM FOR HIRING FOR PHYSICAL AL STRACTIVENESS
AND THE AIRPLANES ARE YOUNG,
TOO.
>> STEPHEN: YOUNG SUPERHOT SERVING A HOT MEAL.
WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE TAKING OFF,
LANDING PART.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE PRIORITIES.
>> I DESCRIBE IN THE BOOK HOW AMERICAN F.A.A. PEOPLE AND PILOTS HAVE TRAINED THE CHINESE
PIE WILL THES SO IT'S GONE FROM ONE OF MOST DANGEROUS TO ONE OF SAFEST.
IT'S SAFER TO FLY IN CHINA THAN THE U.S.
THERE'S DELAYS BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.
THE MILITARY CONTROLS ALL THE AIR SPACE IN CONDITION CHINA.
THAT'S ONE OF BIG TENSIONS BETWEEN BUSINESS PEOPLE IN MILITARY IN CHINA TO LOOSEN THAT UP.
>> STEPHEN: CAN YOU SMOKE ON THE AIRLINES IN CHINA OR IS THE
AIR SO THICK YOU COULDN'T TELL?
>> THAT'S OFTEN A QUESTION.
THEY DISCOURAGE IT.
SOMETHING SAID SOMETHING THAT SURPRISED ME WHICH IS CHINESE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE RULES.
YOU SEE IT ON AN AIRPLANE.
THE INSTANT THE WHEELS TOUCH THE TARMAC,  EVERYBODY RUNS TO THE PLANE.
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS  GETTING OUT OF THE WAY TO AVOID THE STAMPEDE.
I HAVE PICTURES OF IT.
>> STEPHEN: I THINK WE SHOULD ADOPT THAT HERE.
>> IT DOES SPEED UP ENTRY.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT AIRPORTS AND THAT SORT OF THING?
DO THEY HAVE AIRPORTS WITH FOOD COURTS?
DO THEY HAVE PANDA EXPRESS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> NO.
THEY HAVE CHINESE FOOD.
THEY HAVE NEW AIRPORTS.
BUILDING 100 NEW ONES RIGHT NOW.
>> STEPHEN: 100 NEW AIRPORTS SOX THEY FIGURE IN TIME TRAFFIC WILL CATCH UP.
THEY HAVE A BILLION PLUS PEOPLE THAT WANT TO TRAVEL.
THEY HAVE NEW AIRPORTS.
KEEP YOUR SHOES ON THROUGH SECURITY LINE.
KEEP YOUR BELT ON SOMETIMES DON'T CHECK YOUR I.D.
THE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE HAS NOT CAUGHT UP WITH OURS IN ALL WAYS.
>> STEPHEN: IS THERE ANYWAY TO STOP THE CHINESE AND SHOULD WE STOP THEM?
WE'RE THE GLOBAL LEADER IN EVERYTHING AND I FEAR THE EMERGENCE OF A COMPETITOR.
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE U.S. HAS ITS LARGEST EXPORT SURPLUS.
THE COMPANY BOEING IS THE BIGGEST EXPORTER.
IT'S SOMETHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.
MY ARGUMENT HERE IS IF CHINA WERE TO SUCCEED IT WOULD ACTUALLY BECOME A EASIER CHINA TO DEAL WITH.
THE AUTHORITARIANISM THAT ALLOWED THEM TO SUCCEED WON'T ALLOW THEM TO SUCCEED IN THIS WAY.
THAT'S MY CASE.
>> STEPHEN: LAST QUESTION:  DO THEY HAVE HONEY ROAST PEANUT TECHNOLOGY?
>> NOT THAT I'VE SEEN.
>> Stephen: THEN WE'RE STILL AAHEAD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
JAMES FALLOWS, "CHINA AIRBORNE," WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
