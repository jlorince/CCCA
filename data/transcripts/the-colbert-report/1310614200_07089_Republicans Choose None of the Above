[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S THE GUY.
AND FOLKS, WE NEED A NEW LEADER
SOON, BECAUSE AMERICA IS
STANDING AT A PRECIPICE.
WHICH  I THINK IS EITHER A BON
FIRE OR A POISONOUS AUSTRALIAN
JELLYFISH.
NOT SURE, BUT THE POINT IS,
PRECIPICES ARE SCARY, AND WE'RE
AT ONE.
IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, WE WILL
REACH THE DEADLINE FOR RAISING
AMERICA'S DEBT CEILING.
IF CONGRESS DOESN'T AUTHORIZE
BORROWING MORE MONEY, IT COULD
DESTROY OUR CREDIT RATING AND
AND THEN
CHINA WOULD BACK A TOW TRUCK UP
TO KANSAS AND DRAG IT OFF TO
GUANGDONG PROVINCE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT MAY HAPPEN.
THAT MAY HAPPEN
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT AND
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE
LOCKED IN A STARING CONTEST OVER
A PISSING CONTEST OVER WHO WILL
BLINK FIRST.
MY BET IS WHOEVER GETS THEIR
EYES PISSED IN.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
THE DEBT CEILING A LOT ON THE
SHOW, BECAUSE I THINK A NEWS
SHOW TALKING ABOUT FEDERAL
BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS IS JUST
CHEAP, SALACIOUS VIEWER BAIT.
[LAUGHTER]
I LEAN TOWARD HARDER NEWS LIKE
DUCK FASHION SHOWS.
ADORABLE.
GOOD STORY.
I BROKE THAT STORY, BY THE WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT HERE'S HOW WE GOT WHERE WE
ARE.
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,
THE PRESIDENT SAID TO THE
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP "YOU GUYS,
WE GOTTA RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING."
THE REPUBLICANS SAID, "NO WAY,
NERD."
[LAUGHTER]
THE PRESIDENT SAID "YOU GUYS,
THIS ISN'T FUNNY!
IF WE DON'T RAISE IT, THE
ECONOMY WILL MELT DOWN.
AND WE COULD GET INTO TROUBLE!"
[LAUGHTER]
SO THE REPUBLICANS SAID, "OKAY,
IF YOU'RE REALLY THAT WORRIED
ABOUT IT, POINDEXTER, WE MIGHT
VOTE TO RAISE IT, BUT FIRST WE
HAVE TO MAKE MASSIVE BUDGET
CUTS."
THE PRESIDENT SAID, "THANKS,
GUYS."
[LAUGHTER]
SO FAR, THE GOP PLAN IS WORKING.
THEY'VE GOT BARRY HERE OVER A
BARREL, AND THEY ARE SPANKING
HIM LIKE A PAGE IN THE SENATE
CLOAKROOM.
[LAUGHTER]
OBAMA AGREES TO $4 TRILLION IN
CUTS.
BUT THEN, IN A TRULY CYNICAL
MOVE, OBAMA PULLS THE OLD
WASHINGTON TRICK OF ASKING FOR
SOMETHING IN RETURN.
BUT HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC
CANTOR EXPLAINED THAT THE
REPUBLICANS ONLY CONCESSION WILL
BE "THE FACT THAT WE'RE EVEN
DISCUSSING VOTING FOR A
DEBT-CEILING INCREASE."
OK?
THEY AGREE TO NEGOTIATE, IN
RETURN THE PRESIDENT GIVES THEM
EVERYTHING THEY WANT.
IT'S LIKE  THE OLD SAYING "YOU
SCRATCH MY BACK, I GET MY BACK
SCRATCHED."
[LAUGHTER]
THEY CAN'T -- THESE
REPUBLICANS -- YEAH, THESE
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY CAN'T GIVE OBAMA AN INCH.
'CUZ AGAIN, CANTOR SAID IT BEST:
"I DON'T THINK THE WHITE HOUSE
UNDERSTANDS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS
FOR FISCAL CONSERVATIVES TO SAY
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR A
DEBT-CEILING INCREASE."
COME ON!
IMAGINE THE SHAME OF HAVING TO
LOOK THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THE
EYES AND TELL THEM: "THE
AMERICAN ECONOMY STILL EXISTS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND LISTEN TO WHAT OBAMA WANTS
IN RETURN:
IF WE CHOOSE TO KEEP THE CUTS
FOR MILLIONAIRE AND BILLIONAIRES
WE HAVE TO MAKE DEEPER CUTS
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
STEERCHL HE'S SAYING THEY HAVE
TO RAISE TAXES.
AND REPUBLICANS CANNOT AGREE TO
THAT.
THEY'VE ALL SIGNED
GROVER NORQUIST'S ANTI-TAX
PLEDGE!
HE'S LIKE DARTH VADER;
HE CAN CRUSH THEIR LARYNX WITH
HIS MIND.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY.
NOW THAT WE'RE IN THIS CRISIS
THAT THE REPUBLICANS CREATED TO
GET PARTISAN ADVANTAGE
BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TO
EITHER RAISE TAXES OR GET BLAMED
FOR DEFAULTING ON OUR NATIONAL
DEBT.
THEY SEEM TO HAVE PAINTED
THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER, OR AS
POLITICAL SCIENTISTS CALL IT,
"GOT THEIR NUTS CAUGHT IN A
VISE."
THANKFULLY, ON THE SENATE FLOOR
YESTERDAY, MINORITY LEADER AND
SEPTUGINARIAN NINJA TURTLE MITCH
[LAUGHTER]
MCCONNELL SWOOPED IN AND SAVED
THE DAY.
FIRST, POINTING OUT THAT THE
REPUBLICANS HAVE NO GOOD
OPTIONS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS PRESENTED
US WITH 3 CHOICES: SMOKE AND
MIRRORS, TAX HIKES OR DEFAULT.
REPUBLICANS CHOOSE NONE OF THE
ABOVE.
>> Stephen: COINCIDENTALLY,
"NONE OF THE ABOVE" IS ALSO THE
LEADING REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT HE HAS A SIMPLE WAY OUT OF
THIS MESS: TO KEEP THE
REPUBLICANS FROM BEING BLAMED
FOR RAISING TAXES OR DEFAULTING
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ASK THE
PRESIDENT TO SUBMIT A REQUEST TO
CONGRESS TO RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING.
THEN, VOTE YES ON A RESOLUTION
DISAPPROVING OF THE THING THEY
ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO DO.
THEN, OBAMA WOULD VETO THE
DISAPPROVAL, AND SINCE THE
REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE THE TWO
THIRDS MAJORITY TO OVERRIDE THE
VETO, THE DEBT CEILING GETS
RAISED AND THE REPUBLICANS GET
TO SAY THEY VOTED AGAINST IT.
TWICE.
JUST LIKE THE CLASSIC JIMMY
STEWART MOVIE.
"MR. SMITH GIVES UP AND STARTS
SHOOTING PEOPLE."
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S BRILLIANT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S BRILLIANT.
THE GOP GETS EVERYTHING THEY
WANT, EXCEPT ANYTHING THEY ASKED
FOR.
AND OBAMA GETS STUCK WITH WHAT
HE WANTED TO BEGIN WITH.
AND MCCONNELL HAS GOTTEN THEIR
NUTS OUT OF THAT VISE -- BY
CUTTING THEM OFF AND LEAVING
THEM BEHIND FOR OBAMA TO HANG
FROM HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR AS AN
AIR FRESHENER.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT THAT MCCONNELL'S NUTS WOULD
BE THAT REFRESHING.
WHEN WE RETURN, WE WILL BASK IN
THE BRILLIANCE OF MITCH
MCCONNELL WITH WALL STREET
JOURNAL CONGRESSIONAL
CORRESPONDENT, NAFTALI BENDAVID.
