>> Stephen: WHOOO!
WHOOO!
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, BARACK OBAMA IS THE
WORST TYPE OF DEMOCRATIC
POLITICIAN.
AN EFFECTIVE ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
ON TUESDAY HE WAS DOWN IN EL
PASO, TEXAS, LAYING OUT HIS
PLAN FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.
WHAT DOES BARACK OBAMA KNOW
ABOUT IMMIGRATION?
EVERYBODY KNOWS HE WAS BORN
IN AMERICA.
I HAVE PROOF.
(LAUGHTER)
BESIDES, THIS SPEECH WAS
ABOUT ONE THING ONLY --
>> IS THE PRESIDENT PUSHING
REAL REFORM OR IS HE
PANDERING FROM LATINO VOTES.
>> HE'S PANDZERING FOR VOTES
DOWN THERE.
>> IT'S PANDERING.
>> Stephen: A TOTAL LATINO
PANDERFEST.
EXCUSE ME, PANDER FIESTA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SHOW THEM, JIM.
>> WHEN I THINK ABOUT
IMMIGRATION, I THINK ABOUT
OPPORTUNITY.
INALIEN KBL RIGHTS, THE
AMERICAN FLAG, STATUE OF
LIBERTY, NATION OF
IMMIGRANTS, GUATEMALAN, YEW
CRANIAN, IRISH, ITALIAN,
POLISH, RUSSIAN, JEWISH.
PAPAO NEW GUINEA.
>> Stephen: JUST LISTEN TO
HIM PANDER TO THE ALL
IMPORTANT TEXAS LATTINO
PAPUA NEW GUINEA VOTE.
NEXT HE'S GOING TO BE OUT
THERE IN A BAMBOO PENIS
SHEATH EATING A SPANISH
EXPLORER.
WELCOME TO OBAMA'S AMERICA,
FOLKS.
AND TO KEEP THE PANDERMONIUM
GOING HE BASHED REPUBLICANS
OVERBOARDER SECURITY.
>> ALL THE STUFF THEY ASKED
FOR, WE'VE DONE.
THEY SAID WE NEEDED TO
TRIPLE THE BORDER PATROL.
WE'RE NOW THEY'RE GOING TO
SAY WE NEED TO QUADRUPLE THE
BORDER PATROL.
OR THEY'LL WANT A HIGHER
FENCE.
MAYBE THEY WILL NEED A MOAT.
MAYBE THEY WANT ALLIGATORS
IN THE MOAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: A MOAT WITH
ALLIGATORS, WHY DOES THAT
IDEA SOUND SO FAMILIAR AND
BRILLIANT TO ME?
>> WE NEED TWO WALLS, WE
FEED A MOAT.
A WANT A 20 FOOT HIGH WALL
2,000 MILES LONG YOU CAN SEE
FROM SPACE.
A MOAT.
>> I'M JUST SAYING A MOAT
WITH SOME ALLIGATORS IN IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S SAD.
THE PRESIDENT ISN'T JUST
WRITING MY COATTAILS HE'S
RIDING MY MOAT TAILS.
FRANKLY, THIS FITS THE
PATTERN FOR OBAMA.
HE STOLE MY IDEA FOR MOAT
GATORS JUST LIKE HE STOLE
PRESIDENT BUSH'S IDEA CONFI
KILLING CAN BIN LADEN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND GEORGE
