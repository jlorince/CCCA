YOSEMITE SAM.
NOW FOLKS SPEAKING OF OUR
FUTURE PRESIDENT IT IS DAY
SIX OF WHAT MANY INSIDE THIS
DESK ARE CALLING PARRY WITH
AN A GATE.
FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST
EMERGING FROM A COMA IN YOUR
TIME MACHINE LAST WEEK
COLBERT SUPERPAC PRODUCED A
MULTI100 DOLLAR AD CAMPAIGN
URGING IOWANANS' AMES STRAW
POLL TO WRITE IN RICK PARRY
WITH AN A, THAT IS A FOR
PAAAARRY.
AND ON SATURDAY AT THE STRAW
POLL WHEN ALL THE FRIED PUT
HER BEEN EATEN AND ALL THE
VOTES HAD BEEN COUNTED, RICK
PARRY CAME IN NUMBER ONE,
TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
SIXTH PLACE--

VOTED FOR PARRY WITH AN A
