IMPORTANTLY, THAT'S ITFOR MY YEARS OF LIVE ELECTION
COVERAGE.

(LAUGHTER)COUNTING MY TIME ON THE DAILY
SHOW WITH JON DAILY AND THEDAILY ZOO CREW, WE'VE BEEN
GETTING TOGETHER WITH YOU LIKETHIS SINCE 2000.
WHO CAN FORGET THATONE? BUSH V CHAD.
IF YOU'RE COUNTING, THAT'S 8LIVE ELECTION SHOWS IN 14 YEARS.
MAKES SENSE SINCE 14DIVIDED BY 2 IS 8.
(LAUGHTER)I HAVE SO MANY MEMORIES. MOSTLY
SHAPES AND COLORS.
THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OFDRINKING ALONG THE WAY.
(LAUGHTER)AS I LEAVE YOU FOR THE LAST
TIME, I'D LIKE TO SHARE WHATI'VE LEARNED WITH FUTURE
GENERATIONS AS WELL AS THEALIENS FROM ZAFRAX-5 WHO FIND
THIS SHOW ON THE GOLDENCYLINDERS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE
MOMENTS BEFORE THE EARTHEXPLODES.
HI GUYS!
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT WHOEVER WONTHIS ELECTION, THE REPUBLICANS,
SOMEONE IS ALWAYS RUNNINGAGAINST SOMEONE SOMEWHERE
ELSE OR OTHER.
ONE OF THEM WINS, THE OTHERLOSES.
SOME ARE TOO CLOSE TO CALL. YOUMEAN TO CHECK BACK LATER
AND FIND OUT WHO WON. BUT YOUFORGET AND BY THE TIME YOU
THINK TO DO IT, THERE'S ALREADYANOTHER ELECTION.
I'M SURE THEY WRITE DOWN WHO THEGOVERNOR OF NORTH DAKOTA IS
SOMEWHERE.
I COULDN'T FIND IT.
BUT MOST OF US AREN'T GOING TONEED THAT INFORMATION.
WE GO ABOUT OUR LIVES SECURE INTHE KNOWLEDGE THAT NORTH DAKOTA
HAS A GOVERNOR OR EQUIVALENT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER?
THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMENOF BROADCAST NEWS WHO TOLD US
WHO WON THAT GOVERNOR'S RACE.
MEN AND WOMEN LIKE -- STEPHENCOLBERT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU SEE, FOLKS,
TONIGHT MARKS A SORT OF FAREWELLFOR ME.
MAYBE SOME DAY YOU WILL SEE MEON TV AGAIN AND YOU WILL NUDGE
YOUR SPOUSE AND SAY, HEY, IREMEMBER THAT GUY.
I USED TO LOVE HIM.
MAYBE I WILL BUY HIS SLAP CHOP.
SO THAT'S IT FOR "THE REPORT."
I'LL END BY SAYING IT'S BEEN APLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE TO HAVE
BEEN WELCOMED INTO YOUR HOMETHESE LAST NINE YEARS.
SO TO YOU AND YOURS, I'LL SAY AFOND -- WHAT'S THAT?
ANOTHER MONTH AND A HALF OFSHOWS?
(LAUGHTER)WELL, THEN, THIS WAS A LITTLE
TOO DRAMATIC.
(LAUGHTER)I'M SORRY.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW!
I'M EMBARRASSED!
WOW!
