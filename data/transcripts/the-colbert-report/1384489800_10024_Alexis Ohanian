>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT,
THE CO-FOUNDER OF THE SOCIALNEWS SIGHT, HE'S GOT CALLED
RED IF.
HE HAS A NEW BOOK AND IHAVEN'T READ IT.
PLEASE WELCOME ALEXIS OHANDIAN.
ALEXIS, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
WE MET A COUPLE TIMESBEFORE.
>> YES.
>> COULDN'T DRESS UP.
>> I SEE, I SPUT ON ASWAKET.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT.
>> A SWEATER JACKET.
THAT IS HOW I WAS TOLD TODRESS.
I'M WISE, I LISTEN MYGIRLFRIEND.
>> Stephen: NOW BESIDESBEING SORT OF AN EARLY
INTERNET WONDERKIN WITHBEING CO-FOUNDER OF RED T
EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS.
I HAVE EXPLAINED IT ON THESHOW BEFORE AND PEOPLE THAT
ARE ON IT THE NEXT DAY GOTHAT IS NOT WHAT RED IT IS.
WHAT IS RED IT.
>> IS A PLATFORM FOR ON-LINECOMMUNITITES TO SHARE LINKS
AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUTWHAT IS NEW AND INTERESTING
ON THE INTERNET.
>> Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S MYPROBLEM WITH IT.
THIS IS MY PROBLEM WITH READIT.
MY PROBLEM IS THAT THEREUSED TO BE A TIME WHEN THERE
WAS A CLASS OF CULTURAL CASEMAKERS LIKE MYSELF WHO TOLD
YOU WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANTTHING WAS TO READ OR SEE
TODAY.
WHEREAS ON READ IT EVERYBODYGETS TO POST AND EVERYBODY
GETS A VOTE, EVERYBODY GETSTO GOIAY,-- YAY, AND YOU
KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT?
I SAY OOOH.
OKAY.
WHY SHOULD EVERYBODY GET AVOTE AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD
ALL BE RAEBDING.
THAT IS CULTURAL SOCIALISM.
>> I LIKE TO THINK OF IT ASA LITTLE BIT OF DEMOCRACY
ON-LINE, THE IDEA THAT ANYONE OF US HAS A GREAT IDEA
WORTH SHARING OR AN OPINIONWORTH HEARING IS SORT OF
BAKED INTO HOW THAT PLATFORMWORKS AND HOW THIS COUNTRY
WORKS.
>> BUT ON READ IT YOU DON'THAVE TO BE A CERTAIN AGE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE APROPERTY OWNER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASS ALITERACY TEST, ALL THE
THINGS WE LOOK FOR IN OURDEMOCRACY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WE WANTEDIT TO BE AS OPEN AS
POSSIBLE.
AND THE HOPE IS MORE PEOPLEWHO OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD ACCESS NOW CAN.
AND WHO CAN NOW SHARE THEIRIDEAS WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO BEFORE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SPEAKINGOF SHARING IDEA, YOU ARE
SHARING IDEAS IN A NEW BOOK.
IT'S CALLED WITHOUT THEIRPERMISSION.
OKAY.
WHAT IS IT YOU ARE DOINGWITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION AND
WHO IS THEY?
>> IT IS THE GATEKEEPERS, ITIS THIS IDEA THAT ON-LINE WE
HAVE THIS THING CALLEDPERMISSIONLESS INNOVATION.
THE IDEA THAT ANYBODY WITH AGREAT IDEA CAN SHARE IT WITH
THE WORLD, WHETHER IT IS ABUSINESS OR A NONPROFIT OR
AN ART PROJECT OR ACTIVISM.
AND THAT MEANS WE GET TOSURFACE MORE IDEAS AND
CREATIVITY FROM MORE PEOPLEWHO DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH
GATEKEEPERS.
>> Stephen: DON'TGATEKEEPERS TELL US WHAT IS
GOOD AND BAD?
>> GATEKEEPERS SOMETIMES GETIT RIGHT.
JON STEWART HAD A GOODCHOICE BRINGING YOU ON
BOARD.
>> Stephen: I WAS AT THEDAILY SHOW BEFORE HE WAS BUT
GO AHEAD.
>> Stephen: WHATEVER,WHATEVER, THAT'S NOT A KNOCK,
THAT'S JUST A FACT.
>> THE HOPE IS WITH APLATFORM LIKE READ IT OR THE
INTERNET WE GET TO HEAR FROMMORE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY
OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVEGOTTEN THE GOOD FORTUNE OF
FINDING THE RIGHT GATEKEEPERAT THE RIGHT TIME.
>> Stephen: SO IF I WANTEDTO DO AN INTERNET START UP,
WHAT DO YOU DO?
I KNOW YOU START AND THAT ISWHERE YOU START, YOU START
ON-LINE.
THE LAST THING YOU DID YOUSELL IT TO GOOGLE FOR $4
BILLION.
WHAT DO YOU DO IN BETWEEN.
HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TOFUND YOU ON THE INTERNET,
CAN YOU USE THE INTERNET TOFUND YOU ON THE INTERNET?
>> YOU KNOW IT SOUNDSRIDDICK LOSE BUT IT'S A AZ
MAGAZINE.
WITH-- WE ARE SEEING MOREAND MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND
ME WHO ARE GOING TO HELPTHEIR FELLOW AMERICANS WITH
GREAT IDEAS.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BEYOU THEN.
>> THERE ARE MORE OF THESECROWD FUNDING PLATFORMS THAT
LET SOMEONE WITH A GREATIDEA TO RAISE FUNDING, KICK
STARTER IS AN ON VIEWS ONE.
IN THE LAST YEAR MORE MONEYHAS GONE THROUGH THAT FOR
ART PROGRAMS THAN THROUGHTHE NATIONAL
ENDURE-- ENDOWMENT OF THEARTS.
>> Stephen: MORE DOLLARS.
>> MORE DOLLARS, YES.
>> Stephen: HAVE WE REACHEDTHE DREAM OF KILLING THE
NEA?
>> I DON'T THINK-- THEY'RENOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
I LIKE KNOWING WE GET TOLIVE IN A WORLD WHERE
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE ACHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE OF
HAMLET CAN GET A BOOKPUBLISHED THANKS TO THE
INTERNET AND A BFERJ OFPEOPLE.
>> Stephen: DID THAT HAPPEN.
>> IT DID, IT RAISED OVER$600,000 FOR THAT BOOK.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS INTO HAMLET IN THIS TIME.
>> IT'S SOMETHING YOUCHOOSE-- YOU CHOOSE WHATEVER
ADVENTURE YOU LIKE.
YOU COULD TAKE D I MEAN ICAN'T POSSIBLY TELL YOU ALL
THE OPTIONS, YOU HAVE TOREAD THE BOOK.
BUT THERE ARE MANY.
>> Stephen: IT'S A SADSTORY.
>> YOU CAN HAVE IT TURN OUTBETTER.
>> Stephen: REALLY, YOU CANHAVE A HAPPY HAMLET?
>> YES, LIKE OPHELIA LIVESAND-- IS NOT HIDING BEHIND
THE CURTAIN AND ALL THATKIND OF STUFF.
>> AND WHAT IS SO EXCITING.
>> Stephen: TO BE OR NOT TOBE, DEFINITELY TO BE.
NOW WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSIONARE YOU RIGHT NOW ON A FIVE
MONTH BUS TOUR TO PROMOTEINTERNET ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Stephen: WOULDN'T THEREBE AN EASIER WAY TO DO THAT
SAY ON THE INTERNET?
>> TOUCHE.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SPEAKSPANISH OR WHATEVER.
>> I WANTED AN EXCUSE TORENT A BUS AND A T-SHIRT
CANON AND VISIT 77UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY BECAUSE MY FELLOWMILLENNIALS ARE THE ONES WHO
WILL BE ABLE TO DO ALL OFTHIS AMAZING STUFF.
BECAUSE IT IS NOT UNTIL ICAN ACTUALLY GET IF FRONT OF
THEM AND HOPEFULLY GIVE THEMTHE LECTURE I WISH I HAD AS
AN UNDERGRAD THAT WILLGALVANIZE THEM.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT, GIVETHE LECTURE, BOIL IT DOWN TO
TEN WORDS WHAT IS THE THING,BECAUSE I'M-- US MILLENNIALS
NEED TO HEAR IT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, ON AN INTERNETWE'RE ALL LINKS ARE CREATED
EQUAL.
YOU CAN TAKE A GREAT IDEAAND YOU CAN TAKE ALL OF THAT
AMBITION AND ACTUALLY REACHYOUR MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FOR
BEING AWESOME THANKS TO THEOPEN INTERNET.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE AWISEMAN.
