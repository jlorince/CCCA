[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, STAYING ON INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW THERE IS NO
GREATER FRIEND TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL THAN YOURS TRULY.
CERTAINLY A BETTER FRIEND THAN BARACK OBAMA, WHO HAS REPEATEDLY SNUBBED OUR ALLY BY REFUSING TO VISIT.
HE CAN'T KEEP PUTTING IT OFF BY SAYING, "NEXT YEAR, IN JERUSALEM" AT HIS ANNUAL
PASSOVER SEDER!
AND I WON'T EVEN GET INTO WHAT AN INSULT IT WAS TO THE JEWISH PEOPLE THAT THE BRISKET
WAS DRY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOW, THE GREATEST INSULT OF ALL.
>> OBAMA WILL MAKE HIS FIRST TRIP TO ISRAEL AS PRESIDENT.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE HASN'T RELEASED DETAILS OF HIS TRIP BUT ISRAELI MEDIA SAYS HE'S VISITING
THIS SPRING.
>> Stephen: OH, SO NOW OBAMA THINKS HE CAN WIPE OUT HIS SHAMEFUL RECORD OF NEVER
VISITING ISRAEL BY VISITING ISRAEL.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S A CHONDA!
DON'T FALL FOR IT, MY CHOSEN BRETHREN, MY HE-BROS.
[LAUGHTER]
HE DOESN'T GET YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS MAN DOESN'T GET IT.
ISRAEL IS A DIVIDED COUNTRY THAT FEELS BESEIGED BY TERRORISTS, AND WHOSE POLITICS ARE
INCREASINGLY DICTATED BY A SMALL, HARD-RIGHT MINORITY.
OBAMA CAN'T RELATE TO THAT!
[LAUGHTER]
AND IF YOU NEED MORE PROOF THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NO FRIEND OF ISRAEL, JUST DO THE MATH:
BACK IN 2007, PRESIDENT BUSH SUPPORTED ISRAEL WITH $2.3 BILLION IN FOREIGN MILITARY AID.
THIS YEAR, PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TO BRING THAT DOWN TO JUST $3.1 BILLION.
[LAUGHTER]
I KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING UP, BUT REMEMBER, IN HEBREW YOU READ CHARTS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND OUR WORST FEARS ABOUT OBAMA WERE CONFIRMED WHEN HE APPOINTED AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FORMER
SENATOR AND MAN WHO JUST LEARNED HIS DOG DIED-- CHUCK HAGEL.
[LAUGHTER]
HAGEL HAS A HISTORY OF TROUBLING STATEMENTS.
HE ONCE SAID THE JEWY LOBBY INTIMIDATE DATES A LOT PEOPLE AND I'M NOT AN ISRAELI SENATOR
I'M A UNITED STATES SENATOR.
CLEARLY THIS MAN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T SAY.
FOR INSTANCE, IMPLYING THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T SAY.
WHICH THERE AREN'T.
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT ISRAEL, WHICH I WOULD, IF THERE WAS ANYTHING TO SAY.
BUT THERE ISN'T.
SO THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SAID.
HOW DARE HAGEL SAY IT.
NOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA MAKE A BIG DILLY-O ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHILE HE'S OVER THERE,
OBAMA IS GOING TO GET ISRAEL'S HIGHEST CIVILIAN HONOR, THE "PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF
DISTINCTION." BUT IT'S NOT THAT GREAT, ONCE YOU EAT THE CHOCOLATE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S SUSPICIOUS OF OBAMA'S COMMITTMENT TO ISRAEL.
SO IS THE PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.
DURING THE 2012 CAMPAIGN, NETANYAHU ALL BUT ENDORSED OBAMA'S OPPONENT-- WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW THIS.
I KNOW THIS.
I KNOW THIS.
DON'T TELL ME.
MATZ LATKE?
BRIS SCHMALTZY?
PUTZ SCHMUCKNEY?
WHAT, WHATEVER.
JIM?
>> PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU PRETTY MUCH ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH GOVERNOR ROMNEY.
>> PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, WHO REALLY THREW HIS FULL SUPPORT, IT SEEMED AT TIMES
BEHIND MITT ROMNEY.
>> YOU KNOW THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE THE 1970S WHEN THEY WORKED TOGETHER IN A CONSULTING FIRM.
>> YOU'VE BEEN A PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE AND A STRONG FRIEND OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
