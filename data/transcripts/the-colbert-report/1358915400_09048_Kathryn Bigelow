[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNING  DIRECTOR HERE TO DISCUSS HER CONTROVERSIAL FILM
"ZERO DARK THIRTY." MY IDEA FOR A SEQUEL: "WEEKEND AT OSAMA'S." PLEASE WELCOME KATHRYN BIGELOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: LAST TIME I SAW YOU, I DON'T THINK YOU'D WON THE OSCAR FOR THE HURT LOCKER.
>> I DON'T THINK I HAD.
>> Stephen: THAT'S CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP.
>> I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT COMING ON THE SHOW WHEN YOU WANTED ME.
>> Stephen: YOU BAGGED ON ME BABY DOLL.
>> I WAS SPOOKED BY THE SENATE INVESTIGATION.
SO I REALLY APOLOGIZE BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CHAMPIONING THIS MOVIE.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT IT.
YOU CAN'T SOFTEN UP THE BEAST THAT MUCH.
PAYBACK IS A BIATCH.
HERE WE GO.
>> OH, NO!
>> Stephen: YOUR FILM "ZERO DARK THIRTY" IT'S A FANTASTIC FILM.
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT GO, SEE THE FILM.
IT STIRRED UP THE BEE'S NEST BECAUSE THE FIRST 35 MINUTES IT SHOWS GRAPHICALLY AND IN
WRENCHING DETAIL, THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES COMMONLY KNOWN AS TORTURE.
ALL RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS IN SUCH A HOT -- THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A HOT BUTTON ISSUE?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CAUSED SUCH TROUBLE.
>> TORTURE IS REPREHENSIBLE.
IT'S BEEN A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE.
DEBATED SINCE THE EARLY PART OF 2000 AND IT'S GOING TO BE CONTINUE TO BE DEBATED.
I WOULD CALL THIS MOVIE KIND OF FIRST DRAFT OF HISTORY OR MAYBE THE FIRST ROUGH CUT OF HISTORY.
>> Stephen: WITHOUT A DOUBT.
AMERICANS DON'T READ BOOKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AMERICANS DON'T READ NEWSPAPERS.
AMERICANS GO TO THE MOVIES AND THIS DEPICTION OF THE TORTURE, THE INVESTIGATION, THE CATCHING
OF BIN LAD SEASON GOING TO BE OUR RECORD JUST AS SURELY AS JIM KABESIL DIED FOR OUR SINS.
THIS IS HOW WE'LL SEE IT.
>> THIS IS TEN YEARS -- IT'S ACCURATE THE WAY A MOVIE CAN BE ACCURATE.
IT'S TEN YEARS INTO TWO HOURS.
THERE'S GOOD OLD FASHIONED BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT ENABLED US TO FIND THE COMPOUND IN ABADA BAD WAS IN THE
FILES ALL ALONG SINCE 2001.
IT'S MANY, MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO FINDING THIS COMPOUND.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN ATTACKED BY LIBERALS AND THE ANT-ENHANCED INTERROGATION CROWD
OUT THERE.
ALL RIGHT?
ONE OF THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOUR MOVIE IS IT HAS THE LIBERALS COJONES IN A DOOR HINGE.
YOU HAD TO INCLUDE SCENES OF TORTURE IN THE MOVIE.
YOU HAD TO, IT HAPPENED, RIGHT?
>> IT HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: IF YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE IT?
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE WASHING HISTORY.
>> Stephen: AND THE LIBERALS WOULD HAVE SCREAMED BLOODY MURDER AS IF YOU WERE TORTURING THEM.
>> IT WAS PART OF THE HISTORY.
WE WANTED TO TELL THE STORY RESPECTFULLY AND HONESTLY.
SINCE IT'S PART OF THE HISTORY WE HAD TO SHOW A FEW SEQUENCES OF ENHANCED INTERROGATION BUT
THERE'S MANY TECHNIQUES THAT LED TO THE COMPOUND IN ABADA BAD.
>> Stephen: THERE'S TALK YOU'LL BE CALLED TO TESTIFY BILLION CONGRESS?
>> I DON'T THINK ONE IS EVER READY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I STAND BY THE MOVIE.
I BELIEVE IN THE FILM.
I'M PROUD OF THE FILM.
I WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE MOVISM IT'S BASED ON AN HONEST TELLING OF THE STORY AS
WE KNOW IT.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE DONE TWO FILMS ABOUT OUR WARS, "HURT LOCKER" AND "ZERO DARK THIRTY."
HAVE YOU EVER INCLUDED A SPECIAL THANKS TO GEORGE W. BUSH?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> UM, YOU KNOW -- IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
>> Stephen: BE PLEAT.
>> IT'S A GOOD -- BE POLITE.
>> IT'S A GOOD POINT.
THE CREDIT IN THIS MOVIE GOES TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHO
DEDICATED THEIR LIVES FOR OUR SAFETY.
TO TO ME IS WHAT I THINK IS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WHAT IS NEXT ANY THING A LITTLE LESS CONTROVERSIAL LIKE GUN CONTROL,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY A SAFE -- PLAY IT SAFE NEXT TIME?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'M CAPABLE OF DOING THAT ANYWAY.
>> Stephen: IF YOU GET CALLED UP BEFORE CONGRESS.
>> YOU'LL COME VISIT.
>> Stephen: I'M NEVER GOING NEAR THAT BUILDING AGAIN BUT HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THEY ARE LOVELY PEOPLE UP THERE KATHRYN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BEST OF LUCK.
THE FILM IS "ZERO DIRK THIRTY",
