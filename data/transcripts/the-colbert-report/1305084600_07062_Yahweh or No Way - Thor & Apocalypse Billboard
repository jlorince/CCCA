(CROWD CHANTING "TRUMP")
NO, IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK.
NEEDS TWO SYLLABLES.
NATION, UNLESS YOU SPENT THE
LAST WEEK LIVING IN A CAVE, YOU
KNOW WE KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY, IF YOU DO LIVE IN A
CAVE, THE NAVY SEALS ARE ON THE
WAY, SO ENJOY THAT LEFT EYE
WHILE YOU CAN
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
NOW, DEMOCRATS... TOO SOON?
(LAUGHTER)
DEMOCRATS CREDIT OBAMA.
CONSERVATIVES CREDIT GEORGE W.
BUSH.
PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA
KNOWS WHO'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS RIGHTEOUS KILL.
>> (translated): IT MAKES ME
HAPPY.
IT GIVES ME PLEASURE TO THINK
WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE
BEATIFICATION OF POPE JOHN PAUL
II.
>> (translated): OSAMA BIN
LADEN?
>> (translated): I HAVE SAID
THAT THE POPE'S FIRST MIRACLE
HAS BEEN TO REMOVE FROM THE
EARTH THIS DEMONIC INCARNATION
OF EVIL AND HATRED
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
POPE JOHN PAUL II KILLED BIN
LADEN
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
SEE, HERE'S WHAT HE'S TALKING
ABOUT.
HERE'S WHAT THE PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT.
THE FIRST STEP TO SAINTHOOD IS
CALLED BEATIFICATION AND JOHN
PAUL WAS BEATIFIED THE SAME DAY
BIN LADEN WAS KILLED.
WHICH WAS ALSO THE SAME DAY THAT
THE MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES WON A
SECOND-ROUND PLAYOFF GAME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO YOU CAN PUT J.C. DOWN FOR TWO
MIRACLES.
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS THE LORD WORKS
MIRACLES EVERYDAY, YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO KNOW HOW TO SPOT THEM.
THIS IS YAHWEH OR NO WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
FIRST UP, THE MY VIE "THOR"
UPPED THIS WEEKEND.
THOR IS, OF COURSE, THE NO, SIR
GOT OF LIGHTNING, THUNDER, OAK
TREES AND FERTILITY.
SO HE'S THE ONE YOU WANT TO PRAY
TO IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE LOVE
TO A TREE IN AN ELECTRICAL
STORM.
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
NORSE.
AND THIS WEEKEND, "THOR" PULLED
IN $66 MILLION!
THE POPULARITY OF THIS VIKING
GOD HAS GOT ME WORRIED THAT
CHRISTIANS MAY BECOME
VI-CURIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THERE ARE
A LOT OF SIMILARITIES BETWEEN
THOR AND JESUS.
(LAUGHTER)
JESUS WAS A CARPENTER SO THEY
BOTH HAVE HAMMERS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THEY BOTH HADDAD DI ISSUES.
ODIN EXILED THOR TO EARTH TO
HUMBLE HIM AND GOD SENT JESUS TO
EARTH TO DIE FOR OUR SINS.
EITHER WAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A
COUPLE OF PRETTY AWKWARD
FATHER'S DAYS.
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS BOTH JESUS AND THOR ARE
TOTALLY CUT!
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE OBVIOUS THEOLOGICAL
QUESTION IS COULD JESUS TAKE
THOR IN A FIGHT?
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
YAHWEH!
♪ HALLELUJAH...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
$66 MILLION ISN'T BAD, BUT JESUS
MADE $83 MILLION THE OPENING
WEEKEND OF "THE PASSION OF THE
CHRIST."
SORRY, THOR.
(LAUGHTER)
DOES THAT MAKE YOU THAD?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN THUCK MY MID-GUARD
SERPENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OF COURSE, PROBLEM IS, THOR IS
BOUND TO HAVE A SEQUEL SO GOD
BETTER BRING JESUS BACK SOON AND
WHILE HE'S AT IT THROW HIM SOME
NEW SUPERPOWERS.
HE CAN ALREADY WALK ON WATER,
BUT IMAGINE THOR'S SURPRISE WHEN
JESUS ALSO HAS JET SANDALS AND A
PREHENSILE BEARD.
(LAUGHTER)
AND JESUS MIGHT BE FIGHTING THOR
SOONER THAN YOU THINK, FOLKS,
BECAUSE THE CHRISTIAN GROUP
FAMILY RADIO-- HITS FROM THE
'40s, '50s AND 1860s-- IS
SENDING THREE CARAVANS OF
R.V.s AROUND AMERICA SAYING
"SAVE THE DATE, RETURN OF
CHRIST, MAY 21, 2011."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SAVE THE DATE?
SAVE THE DATE?
LIKE A WEDDING?
(LAUGHTER)
I WONDER IF THE APOCALYPSE WILL
BE CHICKEN OR FISH?
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THIS MEANS THERE ARE ONLY
11 SHOPPING DAYS UNTIL THERE ARE
NO SHOPPING DAYS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO, QUESTION IS, IS IS GOD
ENDING THE WORLD ON MAY 21?
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
YAHWEH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOTE HALLELUJAH... ♪♪
FOLKS, THIS PROPHECY WAS MADE BY
AMERICANS, I LIKE MY DOOM CRYING
HOMEGROWN.
NOT LIKE THAT MAYAN 2012 CRAP
THAT'S BEEN SNEAKING ACROSS OUR
SOUTHERN BORDERS.
IT'S THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE
APOCALYPSE, NOT THE FOUR JORGES
OF THE APOCALYPSE
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
PLUS, FAMILY RADIO'S LEADER
HAROLD CAMPING IS AN EXPERT AT
PREDICTING THE END OF THE
WORLD-- IN THAT HE'S DONE IT
BEFORE.
HE PREVIOUSLY SAID THE WORLD
WOULD END ON SEPTEMBER 4, 1994.
NOW, IN HIS DEFENSE, THAT WAS
THE YEAR THE FIRST HOOTIE & THE
BLOWFISH ALBUM CAME OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK WE ALL PRAYED THE END
WAS NEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THIS TIME CAMPING'S
DEFINITELY PROBABLY GOT IT
RIGHT.
HERE'S HOW HE DOES THE MATH.
NOAH'S FLOOD OCCURRED 7,000
YEARS AGO AND AT THE TIME GOD
TOLD NOAH THAT HE HAD SEVEN DAYS
BEFORE THE FLOOD WOULD START.
THEN IN SECOND PETER IT SAYS
"WITH THE LORD, A DAY IS LIKE A
THOUSAND YEARS."
AND I'M SURE IN HIS JOB IT IS.
YOU THINK CREATING SPREADSHEETS
IS TEDIOUS?
IMAGINE COMING UP WITH A THIRD
KIND OF OWL.
(LAUGHTER)
SO LET'S SEE.
LET'S CHECK HIS NUMBERS THERE.
LET'S SEE.
OKAY.
SEVEN DAYS, SEVEN DAYS TIMES
1,000 CARRY THE CUBIT EQUALS...
(LAUGHTER)
MAY 21.
YUP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND, FOLKS, THAT WORKED OUT
GREAT FOR ME, BECAUSE ON MAY 21,
I WILL BE LEAVING PORT IN THE
ON-DECK CHARLESTON TO BERMUDA
RACE SAILING MY BOAT THE AUDI."
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHILE SINNERS ARE BOILING IN
THEIR OWN JUICES HERE ON SOLID
GROUND, I'LL BE SAFELY IN
INTERNATIONAL WATERS WHERE GOD
DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION
TREATY WITH NEPTUNE.
(APPLAUSE)
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT'S
EDITION OF "YAHWEH OR NO WAY."
AND IF THE PEOPLE OF FAMILY
RADIO ARE RIGHT, THAT'S IT FOR
THE LAST EDITION OF YAHWEH
