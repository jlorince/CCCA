I BELIEVE IS THE LAST DAY OFAMERICA.
[LAUGHTER]THIS IS IT, NATION.
NO, NO, THIS IS IT, DATE WE ALLFEARED WOULD COME, EVER SINCE WE
WERE TOLD IT WOULD COME SEVERALMONTHS AGO HAS COME AT LAST.
[LAUGHTER]BECAUSE TONIGHT AT 8:00 PM
MEXICAN STANDARD TIME.
GENERALISSIMO OBAMA ANNOUNCEDHIS UNILATERAL PLAN TO ALLOW
FOUR MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSTO REMAIN IN AMERICA WITHOUT
FEAR OF DEPORTATION.
IT TURNS OUT THIS WHOLE TIMEWE'VE BEEN BUILDING THAT WALL TO
KEEP THEM IN. [LAUGHTER]

[LAUGHTER] I DO NOT SMOKE.
[LAUGHTER] I DO NOT SMOKE.
[LAUGHTER]BUT FOLKS, THE PRESIDENT'SSPEECH
IS AT 8:00 TONIGHT.
WE ARE TAPING OUR SHOW AT 7:30,SO I DON'T KNOW ONE WORD OF WHAT
HE'S GOING TO SAY.
BUT I DO KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONEWAY TO DESCRIBE IT.
>> IT'S NOT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER,IT'S EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
>> THE PRESIDENT WILL MOVEFORWARD WITH EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
>> EXECUTIVE AMNESTY FOR ILLEGALIMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
>> EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
>> Stephen:  OH REGULAR AMNESTYISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR BARACK'S
AMIGOS, HIS MUCHACHOS, HISCOMPADRES, NO!
HE HAD TO GIVE THEM EXECUTIVEAMNESTY. THEY GET THEIR OWN
WASH ROOM, FREE WIFI AND HOTTOWELS. FOLKS,
MY GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER DIDNOT COME HERE FROM IRELAND TO
SEE THIS COUNTRY  OVERRUN BYIMMIGRANTS.
HE CAME HERE BECAUSE HE KILLED AGUY.
I MEAN WHAT HAPPENED TO CHECKSAND BALANCES SIR.
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THREEBRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND SPITEFUL INERTIA.
BUT APPARENTLY OBAMA HAS JUSTGIVEN HIMSELF A PROMOTION
>> THE EMPEROR IN CHIEF OF THEUNITED STATES IS
GOING TO DECLARE WAR ON THE U.S.CONSTITUTION.
>> Stephen: ALL HAIL BARACKUSMAXIMUS.
WE SHOULD'VE KNOWN HE'S GONE MADWITH POWER. AFTER ALL,
HE APPOINTED HIS HORSE SECRETARYOF STATE
THIS LAWLESS OVERREACH MAKES MEFEAR FOR MY NATION.
I JUST HOPE CALMER HEADS ANDVOICES OF REASON PREVAIL.
OR IF NOT, MAYBE TOM COBURN.
>> THE COUNTRY'S GOING TOGO NUTS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO
SEE IT AS A MOVE OUTSIDE OF THEAUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT.
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A VERYDANGEROUS SITUATION.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOPEFULLYNOT, BUT YOU CAN SEE INSTANCES
OF ANARCHY.
YOU COULD SEE VIOLENCE
>> Stephen:  HE'S RIGHT. IFOBAMA DOES NOT DEPORT THE
PEOPLE ALREADY HERE I CAN ONLYIMAGINE HOW VIOLENT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE WHENTHEY WAKE UP TO SEE HOW SAME
THINGS ARE. LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, WE WILL HAVE MORE ON
THIS STORY TWO DAYS AGO WHEN ITALKED ABOUT IT FOR
LIKE 12 MINUTES. ISN'T THATENOUGH.
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS FOR PETE'SSAKE.
