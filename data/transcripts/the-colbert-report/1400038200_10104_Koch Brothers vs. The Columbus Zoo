>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
NATION, I AM FEELING FINETONIGHT AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF
THE DEFEAT OF A BALLOTINITIATIVE LAST WEEK.
COLUMBUS, OHIO'S ISSUE 6 WHICH WOULD HAVE RAISED PROPERTY
TAXES TO SUPPORT THE COLUMBUSZOO FAMOUS FOR JACK HANNAH,
AMERICA'S FOREMOST EXPERT INCONVINCING TV HOSTS TO LET
ANIMALS PEE-PEE ON THEM. LASTWEEK, OHIO VOTERS POO-POOED IT.
>> MORE THAN 70% OF FRANKLINCOUNTY VOTERS SAID NO TO THAT
ZOO LEVEE.
>> Stephen:  IN YOUR FACE,MANATEE!
OH, WHICHEVER END OF YOU THISIS.
WE OWE THIS VICTORY TO THE KOCHBROTHERS WHO HELPED SWAY
FRANKLIN COUNTY VOTERS WITH THISFLIER CALLING THE ZOO TAX A
MONEY GRAB.
LOOK AT THAT GREEDY CHIMP ASKINGFOR A HANDOUT OR A FOOT-OUT.
YOU CAN'T TELL WITH THESE GUYS.
ALL YOU KNOW FOR SURE IS THEOTHER THREE LIMBS ARE
MASTURBATING.
AS THE KOCH'S MAILER WARNED,THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE
105% INCREASE ON PROPERTY TAXES.
105%!
THAT IS A SCARY NUMBER.
WAY SCARIER THAN THE ACTUALINCREASE 0.76%, OR ABOUT $23 FOR
THE MEDIAN HOMEOWNER.
AND ALL YOU GET FOR YOUR 23BUCKS IS ONE OF THE BEST ZOOS IN
AMERICA.
FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY, YOUCOULD BUY YOUR OWN COPY OF
"MADAGASCAR" ON D.V.D.
NATION, THE KOCHS' VICTORYAGAINST THE COLUMBUS ZOO TAX
SHOWS THEY'RE WILLING TO PLAYHARDBALL EVEN WHEN THEY PLAY
SMALL BALL.
AS THE OHIO DIRECTOR OFAMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY SAID,
THERE IS NOTHING WE WON'T DO,NOTHING!
THERE IS NO CHILDREN'S FIELDTRIP TOO SMALL FOR THESE TWO MEN
TO RUIN.
( LAUGHTER )THEIR NEXT CAMPAIGN IS BANNING
SHARP STRAWS TO PROTECT OURPRECIOUS JUICE BOX RESERVES.
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE FIGHTINGTHIS, FOLKS BECAUSE THE
COLUMBUS ZOO PROMISES TO TRYTHIS AGAIN AS SOON AS NOVEMBER.
WE AT THE THE "COLBERT REPORT"ARE NOT WAITING UNTIL NOVEMBER.
WE ARE CREATING OUR OWN ISSUESAD THAT WE ARE WILLING TO SELL
THE KOCH BROTHERS FOR A BILLIONDOLLARS.
JIM.
>> THE COLUMBUS ZOO WANTS MOREOF YOUR MONEY, BUT WHERE DOES
THAT MONEY GO?
TO FREE HOUSING FOR FOREIGNERSWHO SPEND ALL DAY HIGH ON
EUCALYPTUS.
TO SEX FIENDS GETTING FREAKY INFRONT OF YOUR CHILDREN.
AND GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZEDO-LLAMA CARE.
THEY DON'T SHARE OUR GENES.
AND THEY DON'T SHARE OUR VALUES.
IT'S TIME TO LOCK THEM UP ANDTHROW AWAY THE KEY.
THIS AD SHOULD BE PAID FOR BYAMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, NO MATTERHOW GREAT-- YES, I AGREE.
I AGREE.
NO MATTER HOW GREAT THOSE APESARE, LET'S PROVE THAT HUMANS ARE
STILL BEST WHEN IT COMES TOFLINGING OUR EXCREMENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
