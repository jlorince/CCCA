(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PLEASE, THANK YOU FOR JOIN
JOINING US.
NATION... NATION, BY NOW YOU'VE
ALL HEARD THE BIG NEWS--
COLDPLAY IS HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SPEAKING OF COLDS, THERE'S ALSO
BIG NEWS OUT OF LIBYA.
JIMMY?
MAKE THE TV SPEAK.
>> A U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
NOW SAYS THAT LIBYA'S LEADERS
HAVE INFORMED US THAT QADDAFI IS
INDEED DEAD.
HE'S DEAD, OKAY, GOT IT.
IT'S OFFICIAL, THAT'S FROM A
U.S. OFFICIAL, HE IS DEAD,
MUERTE, GONE.
>> Stephen: YES, QADDAFI IS
DEAD, MUERTE, MUERTO, ADIOS,
SAYONARA, ALOHA.
THE GOOD-BYE ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THIS MORNING, REBELS
SEIZED CONTROL OF THE QADDAFI
STRONGHOLD OF SIRTE WHERE THEY
CAPTURED AND KILLED QADDAFI,
ENDING HIS BRUTAL 42 YEAR REIGN.
NOW IN HINDSIGHT IT MAY HAVE
BEEN A MISTAKE FOR HIM TO HIRE
BODYGUARDS BASED ON THEIR
HOTNESS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW FOLKS, I CAN
UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYBODY IS
CELEBRATING.
BUT PERSONALLY, I HAVE MIXED
FEELINGS.
MOAMMAR WAS A FRIEND OF THE
SHOW.
THE GUY WAS ONE OF A KIND-- PART
MADMAN, PART FASHION ICON, PART
COMIC GENIUS.
HE MADE US LAUGH.
HE MADE US CRY.
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MADE HIM
LAUGH.
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE LOSING EAVES St-LAURENT,
GEORGE BURNS AND POL POT ALL ON
THE SAME DAY.
GEORGE BURNS, OF COURSE, A
HOMICIDAL MANIAC.
NOW, QADDAFI'S DEATH WAS
DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM SINCE EVERY
LIVING PICTURE OF HIM COULD BE
CONFUSED FOR A DEATH PHOTO.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT HERE'S HOW IT WENT DOWN.
>> LIBYAN OFFICIALS ARE SAYING
THAT QADDAFI WAS HIDING IN SOME
SORT OF HOLE OR TUNNEL NETWORK,
THAT HE WAS PULLED FROM THIS
HOLE/TUNNEL NETWORK ALIVE, AND
THAT HE WAS KILLED BY THE
REBELS.
>> Stephen: NOW IF YOU RECALL,
THEY PULLED SADDAM OUT OF A
HOLE.
EVIDENTLY, TOTALITARIAN
DICTATORS ARE A NOCTURNAL
BURROWING SPECIES.
OF COURSE, WHO CAN FORGET ABOUT
THE TIME JACK HANNA BROUGHT KIM
JONG IL ON LENO?
NATION, I SAY WE NEED TO STAY
VIGILANT HERE.
QADDAFI WAS A G, MAYBE GONE, BUT
WE STILL HAVE NOT CAPTURED
QUADDAFI, GASTAFI AND HANNUKAH.
FOLKS, I AM ESPECIALLY...
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I AM ESPECIALLY EXCITED
THIS WAR IS OVER BECAUSE IT
MEANS WE GET TO PICK THE NEXT
WAR!
( LAUGHTER )
I WONDER WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.
IF WE FOLLOW OUR STANDARD WAR
PREDICTOR, IT'S WHOEVER WE WERE
PROPPING UP TEN YEARS AGO.
