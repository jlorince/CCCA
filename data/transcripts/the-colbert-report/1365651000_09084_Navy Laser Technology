[ LAUGHTER ]
AND OUR MILITARY JUST GOT A
WHOLE LOT BAD ASS-ER.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME THE
PENTAGON PLANS TO DEPLOY A
WEAPONNIZED LASER ON A SHIP.
THIS IS SLATED TO GOOD OFF THE
COAST OF IRAN BY NEXT YEAR.
IT SHOWS THE LAIDZER LOCK ON TO
A SLOW MOVING TARGET.
IN THIS CASE AN UNMANNED DRONE.
THE DRONE SOON CATCHES FIRE AND
CRASHES INTO THE SEA BELOW.
>> Stephen: IF YOU THINK IT'S
IMPRESSIVE WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
WHAT THIS LASER DOES TO PLANE
PILOTED BY CASTS.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS, ENEMIES OF
AMERICA, LASER'S ON ♪
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WORLD, AMERICA NOW HAS A LASER
THAT CAN DO ANYTHING FROM BURN
THROUGH A FAST ATTACK BOAT TO
EMIT A NONLETHAL BURST TO DAZZLE
THE ENEMY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE NAVY'S MOST DAZZLING
TECHNOLOGY SINCE THEY
WEAPONNIZED CHER.
♪ IF I COULD FIND A WAY ♪
NOW I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW
THAT EVEN THOUGH AMERICA NOW
POSSESSES LASER WEAPONS IT DOES
NOT MEAN WE'RE GOING TO TURN
INTO AN EVIL EMPIRE ALTHOUGH I
WILL SAY AND OR THAT WE KNOW THE
EWOKS OR THE REBELS AND I FIND
YOUR LACK OF FAITH HIGHLY
LASERRABLE.
THE BEST PART IS IT'S SO
AFFORDABLE.
>> A ROUND OF THIS DIRECTED
ENERGY THAT.
S COULD OUT OF THIS LAYER IS A
LL UNDER $1, A LITTLE UNDER $1
U.S. DOLLAR.
>> Stephen: ONE DOLL YAMPLE
WE'RE LOSING MONEY NOT SETTING
PEOPLE ON FIRE.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO
BE AN AMERICAN WELL.
THIS LASER CANNON NOTHING CAN
STOP US EXCEPT BAD WEATHER,
WATER VAPOR, SMOKE, SAND OR
DUST.
SO WE'LL DEFEAT ALL OF OUR
ENEMIES AS LONG
