( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS )
>> Stephen:  NATION, IF YOU'RE
WONDERING WHY I'M SPEAKING THE
POPE TALK, IT'S BECAUSE TODAY IS
ASH WEDNESDAY, THE BEGINNING OF
LENT, WHEREIN GOODICALS LIKE
MYSELF MAKE A PERSONAL SACRIFICE
FOR 40 DAYS TO BECOME CLOSER TO
GOD.
LAST YEAR, I GAVE UP SOMETHING
TRULY IMPORTANT TO ME AS A
CATHOLIC-- BEING CATHOLIC.
( LAUGHTER )
IT WAS TOUGH.
IT WAS TOUGH.
BUT I DID GET SOME GREAT BAR
MITZVAH GIFTS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU CAN ASK THESE PEOPLE-- I
STILL HAVEN'T DECIDED WHAT TO
GIVE UP THIS YEAR.
( LAUGHTER )
I THOUGHT ABOUT GOING WITH THE
CLASSIC-- YOU KNOW, CHOCOLATE,
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THE
INTRODUCTION OF MINT DARK
CHOCOLATE M&Ms.
I MEAN, I LOVE GOD AND
EVERYTHING, BUT THESE THINGS ARE
LIKE CRACK.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I DEFINITELY
CAN'T GIVE UP CRACK.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
THAT STUFF IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE,
YET REASONABLY PRICED.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I GOTTA FIND SOMETHING TO
SACRIFICE THAT I BOTH ENJOY AND
KNOW I CAN STICK TO GIVING UP.
OH, WAIT, OKAY, I GOT IT.
NATION, AND GOD NATION, THIS
LENT, I, STEPHEN COLBERT, DO
SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO GIVE UP
HIGH-FIVING CONQUISTADORS.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING-- WHY NOT SOMETHING
EASIER LIKE FIST BUMPING LIONS?
( LAUGHTER )
BUT AS AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS
CATHOLIC, I NEED TO SET A GOOD
EXAMPLE, ALL RIGHT.
WISH ME LUCK.
FOLKS, REGULAR VIEWERS KNOW THAT
I HAVE SUCCUMBED TO LIN-SANITY.
HE IS THE BIGGEST BASKETBALL
STORY SINCE THE GAME WAS
INVENTED BY THE AZTECS WHO, OF
COURSE, SUCCUMBED TO
LIN-SMALLPOX.
OH, I LOVE A GOOD AZTEC JOKE!
COME ON, UP TOP, AMIGO!
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  I'M SORRY.
I'M SO--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I-- I'M SO SORRY, DAN DIEGO JUAN
CARLOS.
IT'S JUST THAT I MADE A VERY
SPECIFIC PROMISE TO GOD.
>> COME ON, DON'T LEAVE ME
HANGING LIKE THE SERPENT
QUETZALCOATL.
>> Stephen:  IT'S LENT.
>> YOU USED TO BE FUN.
YOU CHANGED.
>> Stephen:  MAN, I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO SMOKE SO MUCH CRACK TO
FORGET ABOUT THIS.
