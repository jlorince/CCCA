>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, JON KRAKAUER,
TELLS RIPPING YARNS OF TRUE
DANGER.
JIMMY, RELEASE THE KRAKAUER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. KRAKAUER, GOOD TO SEE
YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> PLEASURE IS MINE.
>> Stephen: NOW, I'M A BIG
FAN, READ A BUNCH OF YOUR STUFF.
I HAVEN'T READ THIS ONE YET.
WHEN I SAW THE TITLE HERE,
"WHERE MEN WIN GLORY," I
NATURALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT
NASCAR.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHERE THEY DO IT.
THIS BOOK IS ACTUALLY ABOUT PAT
TILLMAN, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN
THE WAR AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
HE DIED.
NOW, I REMEMBER A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT PAT.
HE WENT TO AFGHANISTAN.
HE WAS A POSSIBLE TO PLAYER,
WENT TO AFGHANISTAN AND WON A
SILVER STAR FOR CHARGING INTO
ENEMY FIRE AND SAVING HIS WHOLE
TROOP, YELLING, I THINK, REELECT
GEORGE BUSH.
>> IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN
THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID I GET
WRONG?
>> HE WASN'T CHARGING A HILL.
HE ACTUALLY DID PERHAPS SAVES
THE LIFE OF A COMRADE BECAUSE
HIS OWN PLATOON MATES WERE
SPRAYING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF
MACHINE-GUN FIRE ALL AROUND HIM.
HE STOOD UP TO WAVE AND HE WAS
SHOT BY HIS OWN PLATOON MATES,
BUT AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: FRIENDLY FIREMENT
>> FRIENDLY FIRE.
AND THE SILVER STAR, THE WHOLE
STORY ABOUT THE TALIBAN CHARGING
THE HILL WAS CONCOCTED TO AVOID
REVEALING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT THIS WAS FRIENDLY FIRE.
>> Stephen: WHAT YEAR ARE WE
TALKING HERE?
>> THIS IS APRIL 2004.
THINGS WERE REALLY BURNING BAD
FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
BUSH WAS UP FOR REELECTION IN
SIX MONTHS.
POLL NUMBERS WERE GOING DOWN.
THE LAST THING THEY WANTED TO
ANNOUNCE WAS THEY SHOT THEIR
POSTER BOY.
THERE ARE E-MAILS FROM RUMSFELD
SAYING, WE WANT TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THIS GUY, MAKE THE MOST OF.
THIS THEY USED HIM SHAMELESSLY.
TILLMAN STOPPED TALKING TO THE
MEDIA WHEN HE DECIDED TO DO
THIS.
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS
TWISTING HIS ARM CONSTANTLY TO
SUPPORT THE WAR, AND HE WAS AN
EXEMPLARY SOLDIER.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
WOULD DO IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
WIN A WAR WITHOUT SUPPORT FOR
THE WAR.
WE LEARNED THAT IN VIETNAM.
AND PAT TILLMAN WAS A
ADVERTISEMENT IN THE LEADERS OF
THE WAR OR THE MEN WHO ORDERED
THE WAR, PROVING TO THE YOUNG
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT SWEETNESS
AND HONOR IT IS TO DIE FOR ONE'S
COUNTRY.
>> IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK.
>> Stephen: IT WORKED FOR A
WHILE.
>> IT WORKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
>> Stephen: HOW DID IT STOP
WORKING?
>> WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS WHOLE
COVER-UP WAS ENGINEERED BY
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL.
>> Stephen: THE GUY WHO JUST
GOT KICKED OUT OF AFGHANISTAN?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WASN'T LET'S JUST KEEP OUR
MOUTH SHUT, IT WAS A VERY
AGGRESSIVE CONSPIRACY.
McCHRYSTAL DISPATCHED ARMY
LAWYERS TO OBSTRUCT AN
INVESTIGATION BY THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF THE ARMY.
HE SUBMITTED THIS FRAUD LEPT
SILVER STAR RECOMMENDATION THAT
MADE NO MENTION FRIENDLY FIRE.
>> Stephen: HOW DID THIS COME
OUT?
>> THEY WEREN'T THINKING AHEAD.
THEY DID ALL THIS ELABORATE
STUFF TO COVER THIS UP, BUT
THERE WERE 200 GUYS IN TILLMAN'S
BATTALION, AND AFTER ABOUT FIVE
WEEKS, THEY CAME HOME FROM
AFGHANISTAN AND HIS COMMANDERS
WENT, HUH, THESE GUYS ARE GOING
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER, THEY'LL
GET DRUNK AND BE PISSED OFFER
AND SPILL THE BEANS.
SO THEY WAITED UNTIL MEMORIAL
DAY WEEKEND WHEN NO ONE IS
WATCHING TV AND THEY HELD A
PRESS CONFERENCE AT 9:00 A.M.
THAT NO ONE SAW.
AND THEY SAID, HE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN KILLED BY FRIENDLY FIRE.
IT'S THE ONLY SINGLE TIME BEFORE
OUR SINCE THAT THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION MADE ANY
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT HE WAS
KILLED BY FRIENDLY FIRE.
>> Stephen: WHY TALK ABOUT
THIS?
BECAUSE IF... SIX MINUTES AGO I
THOUGHT PAT TILLMAN WAS AN
EXAMPLE OF A GOOD REASON TO GO
BE A WARRIOR.
>> HE IS.
>> Stephen: HE IS?
>> HE IS.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE IF I GO TO WAR, I
MIGHT GET KILLED FOR THE WRONG
REASONS AND BY THE WRONG PEOPLE.
>> THAT'S A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY
IN EVERY WAR.
>> Stephen: OF YOU JUST TAKEN
THE SHINE OFF OF COMBAT FOR ME.
A SECOND AGO I WAS SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR.
I BELIEVE IN A STRONG MILITARY.
I WAS EMBEDDED FOR FIVE MONTHS
IN AFGHANISTAN.
I WAS BLOWN AWAY.
I CAME AWAY FOR SUCH ADMIRATION
FOR THE 1% OF THIS COUNTRY
THAT'S SERVED IN THESE WARS.
THESE GUYS, IT IS SUCH HARD JOB.
I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE
DANGER, AND HOW DO WE REPAY
THEM?
HOW DO YOU REPAY SOMEONE LIKE
TILLMAN WHO OUT OF A SENSE OF
DUTY AND PATRIOTISM, HE JOINED
THE ARMY AND THE GUY'S IN THE
ARMY, THE ARMY ITSELF, YOU KNOW,
HIJACKED HIS HONOR.
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT?
IT'S LIKE IF YOU CRITICIZE THAT
YOU'RE NOT A PATRIOT, ALL THIS
STUFF THAT DRIVES ME CRAZY.
IT'S PATRIOTIC...
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU ACCEPT
AT ALL THAT THOSE GUYS WERE
ACTUALLY TRYING TO HONOR HIM?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHY?
THEY MADE HIS DEATH MORE
MEANINGFUL.
>> TILLMAN WAS ALL ABOUT
HONESTY.
HE COULD NOT TELL A LIE.
HE BELIEVED THAT HE KEPT HIS...
HE HAD A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF
THE ARMY.
HE SERVED IN IRAQ, A WAR THAT HE
SAID WAS ILLEGAL AS HELL.
WHEN HE JOINED THE ARMY, HE
DIDN'T KNOW BUSH WAS GOING TO
INVADE IRAQ.
HE DID HIS DUTY AND CAME BACK.
HIS AGENT SAID, THE SEATTLE
SEAHAWKS WANT TO SIGN YOU.
YOU'VE DONE A TOUR, THE NFL AND
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ARE IN
BED TOGETHER, IT'S A DONE DEAL.
>> Stephen: THE NFL AND THE
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT WERE PLAYING
FTSE WITH EACH OTHER?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: NFL GETS
FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT.
SO TILLMAN WOULDN'T EVEN
CONSIDER IT.
HE SAID, NO, I SIGNED UP FOR
THREE YEARS, I'LL SERVE MY THREE
YEARS.
FOUR MONTHS LATER HE WAS IN
AFGHANISTAN AND SHOT BY HIS OWN
GUYS.
SO THIS IS THE MOST HONORABLE,
PATRIOTIC GUY YOU CAN THINK OF,
AND THIS IS HOW HE'S REPAID.
HE BECAME A PROPAGANDA TOOL.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD REPAY THE MEN AND
WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED IN IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN FOR THE PAST
SEVEN YEARS, NINE YEARS FOR
AFGHANISTAN?
>> WE OWE THEM A HUGE DEBT.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO THANK THEM
ENOUGH.
WE SHOULD SUPPORT VETERANS
BENEFITS.
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE PAT
TILLMAN FOUNDATION,
PATTILLMAN.ORG THAT HIS WIDOW
STARTED.
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START.
THE GUYS ARE COMING BACK, A LOT
OF THEM ARE ALL [BLEEPED] UP
FROM I.E.D.s.
THEY HAVE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
AND P.T.S.D.
THEY COME BACK AND THEY'RE
TRYING TO FIT IN.
YOU GOT TO JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
THIS ISN'T...
>> Stephen: I TELL YOU WHAT
THEY DON'T NEED, FILTHY TALK.
THEY'D BE SHOCKED TO HEAR YOU
DROP THE F-BOMB.
THEY'VE BEEN AT WAR, NOT IN A
SALOON, SIR.
MR. KRAKAUER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
