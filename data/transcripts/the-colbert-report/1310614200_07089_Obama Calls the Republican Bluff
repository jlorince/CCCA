[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, BEFORE THE BREAK --
BEFORE THE BREAK, I WAS
CONGRATULATING CONGRESSIONAL
REPUBLICANS ON THE WAY THEY
CUNNINGLY USED THE DEBT CEILING
NEGOTIATIONS TO TRICK BARACK
OBAMA INTO GETTING WHAT HE
WANTED.
HERE TO TELL US HOW THE ON-GOING
NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING ON IS
WALL STREET JOURNAL
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT,
NEFTALI BENDAVID.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
TODAY.
I READ YOUR PUBLICATION TODAY.
THEY HAD AN EDITORIAL IN THERE
SAYING THIS IS KIND OF A SMART
MOVE FOR McCONNELL TO MAKE
GIVEN THE SITUATION.
WHAT IS THE REACTION BEEN IN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY TO WHAT
McCONNELL HAS DONE?
IS EVERYBODY AS EXCITED AS I AM?
>> PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS ARE
VERY, VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS.
THE CONSERVATIVE BLOGO SPHERE
LIT UP --
>> Stephen: I TRIED TO GOOD ON
RED STATE AND MY COMPUTER
EXPLODED.
>> THEY CALLED HIM A WEASEL AND
UPON THEOUS AND OTHER THINGS YOU
COULD THINK OF.
THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP
IS COOL TO THE IDEA.
EVEN SOME OF THE SENATE
REMEMBERS ARE BACKING AWAY FROM
THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED
IT'S GIVING OBAMA TOO MUCH.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
I UNDERSTAND JUST A LITTLE WHILE
AGO OBAMA WALKED OUT OF THE DEBT
NEGOTIATIONS AND SAID DON'T CALL
MY BLUFF NO OTHER PRESIDENT,
REAGAN, WOULD SIT HERE LIKE
THIS.
>> THERE'S AN INCREASING
TESTINESS BETWEEN CANTOR AND
OBAMA.
THEY ARE GOING AT EACH OTHER.
SOMETIME IT'S A PRELUDE TO
REACHING A DEAL.
THEY ARE POSTURING AND THEN THEY
CAN SIT DOWN AND DEGREE.
ON AUGUST 2 THE UNITED STATES
WILL NO LONGER PAY ITS BILLS OR
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.
IT'S GETTING TO A SCARY POINT.
>> Stephen: THAT COULD
GUARANTEE.
THIS COULD BE PART OF THE PLAN
THAT COULD GUARANTEE OBAMA IS A
ONE-TERM PRESIDENT BECAUSE
THERE'S NO MORE AMERICA.
LA LAUGH.
>> THERE'S MANEUVERING GOING ON
FOR WHO WOULD GET THE BLAME.
>> Stephen: OBAMA, RIGHT?
HE GETS THE BLAME THANK IS THE
REPUBLICAN HOPE IS THAT OBAMA
GETS THE BLAME BECAUSE HE
INSISTED ON TAX HIKES IS WHAT
THEY WOULD SAY.
OBAMA IS SAYING THAT SINCE THEY
ARE NOT COMPROMISING THEY SHOULD
GET THE BLAME.
>> Stephen: HE SAYS "DON'T
CALL MY BLUFF" TO ERIC CANTOR
BUT HE IS CALLING THEIR BLUFF,
ISN'T HE?
I THINK ONE OF REASONS WHY HE IS
CALLING THEIR BLUFF IS THAT THEY
HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THEIR
BLUFFING.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY HAVE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE --
WE WON'T RAISE THE DEBT CEILING.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THEN THEY PUBLICLY TOLD THE WALL
STREET BUDDIES, DON'T WORRY
WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING.
THAT'S LIKE PAYING POKER ACROSS
FROM OBAMA AND SAYING (bleep)
WE'RE ALL IN.
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE WHAT I GOT
IN MY HAND AND THEN TURNING TO
YOUR BUDDY AND SAYING I GOT
NOTHING.
OBAMA IS USING THE FACT THAT HE
HEARD THEM SAY THAT.
>> I THINK ONE OF FACTORS HERE
IS THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT THE
REPUBLICANS CAN CONTROL THEIR
OWN TRUTHS.
PARTICULARLY SPEAKER BANER IN
DESCRIBED GETTING THIS --
SPEAKER BOEHNER SAID IT WAS A
RUBIK'S CUBE.
>> Stephen: REAGAN SAID HIS
FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS
LIKE CRAPPING A PINEAPPLE
PERHAPS THEY ARE TRYING TO CRAP
A RUBIK'S CUBE.
>> THIS IS A HARD THING TO GET
THROUGH AND IN ONE HAS FIGURED
IT OUT.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE BRINKSMANSHIP HERE.
I LOVE IT.
I LOVE THE POWER PLAY GOING ON.
I'M ACTUALLY DROOLING I LOVE IT
SO MUCH.
[LAUGHTER]
I LOVE THE PLAY OF FORCES HERE.
AND THE RULE IS -- PHIL GRAHAM
SAID NEVER TAKE A HOSTAGE YOU
ARE NOTING MR. TO SHOOT.
REPUBLICANS HAVE TAKEN AMERICANS
HOSTAGE HERE SAYING GIVE US WHAT
WE WANT OR WE BLOW THE ECONOMIES
BRAINS OUT.
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HELP IF
THEY CONTINUED THE NEGOTIATIONS
LONG ENOUGH UNTIL AMERICA GOT
STOCKHOME SYNDROME AND FELL IN
LOVE WITH WHAT THE REPUBLICANS
WERE DOING, CHANGED OUR NAMED TO
TRACEY AND MARRIED THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK ONE OF PROBLEMS HERE
IS THAT AT SOME POINT IT'S
REALITY AND IT'S NOT A JOKE
ANYMORE.
THIS IS SCARY STUFF.
>> Stephen: THIS IS NOT FUNNY
TO ME.
NAFTALI BENDAVID THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
FROM THE WALL STREET NAFTALI
