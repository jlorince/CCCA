>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU!
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN, WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE NEWS HERE.
FOLKS, WHAT CAN I SAY BUT WOW.
WHAT A WEEKEND OF NEWS.
LET ME CATCH YOU UP.
PREVIOUSLY ON THE "COLBERT
REPORT," I TOLD YOU THAT THE
F.B.I. WERE SEARCHING FOR
SUSPECT 1 AND SUSPECT 2, WHICH
THEY NARROWED DOWN FROM I DON'T
KNOW AND MAYBE THAT GUY.
THEN THURSDAY NIGHT, RIGHT AFTER
MY SHOW AIRED -- COINCIDENCE?
LET HISTORY DECIDE.
( LAUGHTER ).
WE FOUND OUT THAT TWO BROTHERS,
TAMERLAN TSARNAEV AND HIS
YOUNGER BROTHER...
( LAUGHTER )
A LITTLE HELP.
>> ZO-car sa-MY-ev.
>> ja-HAR zar-NYE-eff.
>> JOE-car SAR-nev.
>> JOE-hay sar-NAY-off.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen:  I'M GOING TO GO
WITH WHITE HAT GUY.
( LAUGHTER )
THESE BROTHERS KILLED A YOUNG
POLICEMAN, CARJACKED AN S.U.V.,
ENDING WITH A HIGH-SPEED CHASE
AND A FIREFIGHT IN WHICH
TAMERLAN WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED,
ENDING HIS LIFE AS ALL ISLAMIC
TERRORISTS DREAM-- AT BETH
ISRAEL HOSPITAL.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
MEANWHILE-- MEANWHILE, WHITE HAT
GUY FLED THE SCENE SO
AUTHORITIES START A MASSIVE
MANHUNT, ORDERING THE ENTIRE
CITY OF BOSTON TO
SHELTER-IN-PLACE.
MARKING THE FIRST TIME AN
AMERICAN CITY HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN IF YOU
DON'T COUNT DETROIT.
( LAUGHTER )
IT IS-- IT IS UNPRECEDENTED,
FOLKS.
CNN'S SUSAN CANDIOTTI 7, I
THINK, CAPTUREDLY THE FEELING
BEST.
>> THE STREETS ARE EMPTY.
IT'S EERIE.
IT'S AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD
DROPPED SOMEWHERE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen:  WELL SAID.
THAT'S CNN SUSAN CANDIOTTI
REPORTING LIVE FROM
NO-(BLEEP)YLVANIA.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
THEY FINALLY CAUGHT WHITE HAT
GUY HIDING IN A BOAT, AND HE'S
BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED.
THE QUESTION IS HOW SHOULD THE
UNITED STATES RESPOND TO THIS
ACT OF TERROR?
WHERE SHOULD WE STRIKE BACK?
WELL, LET'S REVIEW WHAT WE KNOW.
THEY ARE MUSLIMS.
THEY ARE BROTHERS.
WHICH MAKES THEM THE MUSLIM
BROTHERHOOD.
( LAUGHTER ).
THAT MEANS EGYPT.
( LAUGHTER )
THEN AGAIN, THEY ARE FROM
CHECHNYA, A FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION LOCATED
IN THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS,
WHICH MAKES THESE TERRORISTS
CAUCASIANS.
( LAUGHTER ).
SO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
CAUCASIAN MALES WITH DARK HAIR
AND ANGER ISSUES, AND I BELIEVE
WE HAVE A COMPUTER COMPOSITE.
( LAUGHTER )
YES.
( APPLAUSE )
THAT IS THE FACE OF EVIL!
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE
CONFUSE CHECHNYA WITH THE CZECH
REPUBLIC, BUT THE CZECH
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. RELEASED
A STATEMENT SAYING THE CZECH
REPUBLIC AND CHECHNYA ARE TWO
VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES.
HMMM.
ME THINKS HE DOTH PROTEST TOO
MUCH.
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE IT DOTH SOUND TOO MUCH
LIKE THAT OTHER THING I DOTH
THOUGHT IT WAS.
( LAUGHTER )
NICE TRY, YOUR AMBASSADORSHIP.
I'M WATCHING YOU, CZECH
REPUBLIC.
YOU, TOO, CHEX MIX.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, EVEN THOUGH-- EVEN THOUGH
THESE BROTHERS ARE ETHNICALLY
CHECHEN BEFORE COMING TO
THE U.S. THEY ALSO SPENT TIME IN
KRYGYZSTAN AND CAS CONTACT STAN,
PLACES SYNONYMOUS WITH UNREST
AND HIGH WORD SCORES IN
SCRABBLE.
( LAUGHTER ).
SO IF WE PUT THE PIECES OF THE
PUZZLE TOGETHER-- RUSSIA,
CHECHNYA, CIRSIG ZACH,
KAZAKHSTAN, THE CZECH REPUBLIC,
IT IS CLEAR WE MUST INVADE IRAQ.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M SAYING.
I'M JUST SAYING, IT WORKED THE
FIRST TIME.
AND THE SECOND TIME.
( LAUGHTER )
