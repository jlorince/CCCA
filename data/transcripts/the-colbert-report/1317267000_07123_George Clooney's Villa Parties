[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOU
ESPECIALLY.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF
I WERE HERE, I'M SURE I WOULD DO
THE SAME THING.
AND, FOLKS, EVERYBODY OUT THERE
IN NOT-ON-TV LAND, IT MUST SEEM
TO YOU AS THOUGH ALL US
CELEBRITIES KNOW EACH OTHER.
I BET YOU THINK SOMEWHERE JERRY
SEINFELD IS HANGING OUT HAVING
COCKTAILS WITH TAYLOR LAUTNER
AND MAGIC JOHNSON.
KATE WINSLET IS WHALE HUNTING
WITH TOM HANKS.
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, FOLKS,
IT'S ALL TRUE.
AS A FAMOUS PERSON, I KNOW ALL
OTHER FAMOUS PEOPLE, EXCEPT FOR
ONE, GEORGE CLOONEY.
FOLKS, I HAVE OFTEN FANTASIZED
ABOUT GETTING INVITED TO
CLOONEY'S PALAZZO IN ITALY,
GETTING DRUNK AND GOING SKINNY
DIPPING IN LAKE LAKE COMO.
WELL, LAST NIGHT ON CONAN, I
FOUND OUT ANOTHER FAMOUS TV HOST
HAS RIPPED OFF MY JOURNAL.
LISTEN TO MARISA TOMEI DESCRIBE
A TYPICAL EVENING AT LAKE
CLOONEY.
>> EVAN RACHEL WOOD AND CINDY
CRAWFORD AND CHARLIE ROSE, WE
WOUND UP ALL SKINNY DIPPING.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
SERIOUSLY.
CLOONEY, YOU INVITED CHARLIE I'M
TOO BORING TO COMPETE WITH A
BACKGROUND ROSE TO GO SKINNY
DIPPING AT YOUR VILLA AND NOT
ME?
HOW COULD YOU?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN MY BODY
GLISTENING IN THE ITALIAN
MOONLIGHT.
WHY AM I EVEN DOING CRUNCHES.
AND THE STORY GETS WORSE, FOLKS.
FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND CNN
SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST DAVID
GERGEN ALSO WAS INVITED TO
CLOONEY'S PALAZZO.
HE WRITES IN "PARADE" MAGAZINE,
AND I QUOTE, "BY 2:00 A.M. OR SO
WHEN I WAS HAMMERED, OUT OF
NOWHERE CLOONEY STARTS CLIMBING
A FENCE THAT OVERLOOKS THE LAKE
BELOW AND JUMPED.
WITHIN SECONDS HE WAS
CHALLENGING OUR MASCULINITY.
HELL, I THOUGHT, I HAVE AN EARLY
MORNING PLANE AND I DON'T WANT
WET CLOTHES, SO WHAT CHOICE DID
I HAVE?
I STRIPPED DOWN.
ONE, TWO, I WAS IN THE WATER BY
THREE.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
DAVID HERE GETS TO GO TO LAKE
COMO AND DIP HIS GERGEN AND NOT
ME?
I GET IT, GEORGE, YOU'RE A
MIDDLE-AGE PUNDIT CHASER.
WELL I'M 47.
CHALLENGE MY MASCULINITY.
I WILL DROP TROU AND SCRAMBLE
OVER ANY FENCE.
THERE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE
ANY WATER.
THERE I COULD BE AT THE AIRPORT
IN HALF AN HOUR.
I WON'T EVEN WEAR A BELT.
JUST CALL ME.
RIGHT NOW THE ONLY INVITATION
I'M GETTING IS FOR ANOTHER
LOOFAH AT
