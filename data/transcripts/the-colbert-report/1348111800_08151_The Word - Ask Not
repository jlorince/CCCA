YOU STEPPED IN IT, MR.
PRESIDENT, YOU STEPPED IT IN WEARING ZOOBA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOMEHOW, FOLKS, OWE -- OBAMA STILL LEADS IN OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA AND FLORIDA.
NO SURPRISE, BLUE COLLAR WHITES, INNER CITY BLACKS AND ELDERLY JEWS ALWAYS VOTE AS A BLOCK.
WHICH ONE IS WHICH?
I CAN'T TELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOME CONSERVATIVES OUT THERE THINK THEY KNOW WHY ROMNEY CAN'T CLOSE THE DEAL.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE PLANS OF MITT ROMNEY, THEY ARE GENERAL, THEY ARE KIND OF VAGUE.
>> ROMNEY TALKS ABOUT VERY BIG CUTS BUT HE IS VERY VAGUE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF HOW HE'S GOING TO
DO IT.
>> PEOPLE ARE BEGUN LOOG FOR A CAND INDICT BE ASSERTIVE BUT ALSO SPECIFIC.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ARE THEY TALK SOMETHING IN ROMNEY AS GIVEN SPECIFIC FIGURES.
FOR INSTANCE, HE IS WILLING TO PISSOFF EXACTLY 47% OF THE VOTERS BUT THE DETAIL DEBBIES OUT THERE ARE ALWAYS DEMANDING
MORE AND MITT ROMNEY IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM IN TONIGHT'S WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ASK NOT -- FOLKS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, MITT ROMNEY HAS ARTICULATED A POSITIVE FORWARD-LOOKING VISION OF WHAT
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IN THE PAST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NAMELY HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING OBAMA DID.
BUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT DESPITE THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR MESSAGE ON THE PAST HE IS BEING CRITICIZED FOR THE TECHNICALITY THAT IF ELECTED HE WILL BE
PRESIDENT IN THE FUTURE.
BUT THE SPECIFIC SALLIES ARE CLAMORING FOR HOW HE WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT, WHAT TAX LOOPHOLES WOULD HE CLOSE.
WHAT IS HIS POLICY IN AFGHANISTAN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, I SAY NO SPOILERS.
WE'LL FIND OUT AFTER NECESSARY ELECTED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FOR NOW -- BUT FOR NOW, FOLKS, MITT IS TELLING US THE NEXT BEST THING.
HE IS TELLING US WHAT HE WILL NOT DO.
>>LY NOT TAKE GOD OUT OF NAME OF OUR PLATFORM.
LY NOT TAKE GOD OFF OUR COINS OR OUT OF MY HEART.
>> STEPHEN: WOO!
WOO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL NOT TAKE GOD OFF OUR COINS.
AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW JUST LIKE GOD THE VALUE OF OUR CURRENCY REALLY HAS TO BE TAKE ON FAITH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLUS, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW IT MEANS A LOT TO GOD TO GET A SHOUTOUT ON A NICKLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHY CHRIST THREW THE MONEY LENDERS OUT OF THE TEMPLE, THEY WOULDN'T LET JESUS SHINE THE SCHEKLES.
THE FACT THAT.
BARACK WANTS TO REMOIST IS UNBELIEVABLE.
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
NO ONE BELIEVES IT.
IN FACT --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- PRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY SAYS THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES AS MUCH THAT GOD SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF A COIN AS HE DOES THAT
ALIENS SHOULD ATTACK FLORIDA.
DO YOU HEAR THAT ELDERLY IN FLORIDA?
PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T BELIEVE ALIENS SHOULD BRING YOU YOUTH RESTORING CACOONS.
WHEREAS N A ROMNEY PRESIDENCY?
>> WE WILL NEVER BE SICK, WE WON'T GET OLDER AND WE'LL NEVER DIE.
>> STEPHEN: WHICH IS ALSO MITT ROMNEY'S MEDICARE PLAN.
THIS IS THE IDEA OF MAKING PROMISES NOT TO DO THINGS NO ONE HAS EVER SAID THEY WANT TO DO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FOLKS THERE'S STILL SO MUCH -- THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO LEFT TO BE SPECIFICALLY NOT DONE.
MITT MUST PROMISE TODAY NOT TO REMOVE THE WORD AMERICA FROM UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE MUST VOW -- HE MUST VOW NEVER TO SIGN ANY BILL THAT SETS YOUR TAX RATE TO YOUR PANTS SIZE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND HE MUST ASSURE US THAT THE OVAL OFFICE WILL NEVER BE TURNED INTO A BUFFALO WILD WING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND AS MILT MITT SLOWLY ENUMERATES ALL POSSIBLE ACTIONS HE WON'T TAKE, BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE WILL DO IT'S LIKE A GAME OF POLITICAL MIND SWEEPER.
FINAL YOU CLICK ON THE WRONG SQUARE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY EXPLODES.
SO MY FELLOW AMERICANS THIS ELECTION ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN CAN DO FOR YOU, ASK WHAT MITT ROMNEY WILL NOT DO FOR
YOUR COUNTRY.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE PRIVATE BACK.
