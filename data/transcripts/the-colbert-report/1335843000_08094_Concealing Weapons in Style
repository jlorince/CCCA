(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, ANYBODY WHO WATCHES THIS SHOW KNOWS I AM A HUGE FAN OF CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS.
BUT FOLK, I'M NOT ALONE.
37 STATES CURRENTLY HAVE LAWS ALLOWING CONCEALED CARRIED PERMITS, COMPARED TO
JUST 8 STATES THERE 1984.
WHICH IS A SHAME.
THINK OF HOW MANY GUNS WOMEN IN THE 80s COULD HAVE HIDDEN IN THOSE SHOULDER PADS.
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU WANT LOOKS THAT KILLMENT LUCKILY GUN OWNERS NO LONGER HAVE TO
SACRIFICE FASHION FOR FIREPOWER.
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES", COMPANIES ARE RUSHING TO MEET THE DEMAND
FOR CONCEALED CARRY CLOTHING.
FINALLY, THE HANDGUN MEETS THE TIM GUNN.
MAKE IT WORK.
OR ELSE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF GUN FASHION BUT FOR ME IT MEANT STYLISH CLOTHING FOR
MY GUN.
THAT'S WHY EVERY DAY MY GUN SWEETNESS AND I WEAR MATCHING OUTFITS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WAS'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT, BABY?
WHAT'S THAT?
NO, NO, IT DOES NOT MAKE YOUR BUTT LOOK FAT.
(LAUGHTER) THERE'S JUST MOVER YOU TO SQUEEZE.
BUT NOW HANDGUN HAB DASHERS -- HABERDASHERS ARE TAKING IT TO A NEW LEVEL.
RECENTLY THE CLOUTHIER WOOLRICH HAS COME OUT WITH CLOTHESING WITH CONCEALED POCKETS.
THE BEST PART IS NO ONE WILL KNOW ABOUT THE GUN IN YOUR POCKET UNLESS YOU'RE UNHAPPY
TO SEE THEM.
THEY'RE THE MOST FASHIONABLE WAY TO GET ACCESS TO YOUR PIECE.
>> OUR GOAL HERE WAS TO MAKE THIS PANT LOOK ENTIRELY 100% NONTACTICAL.
THE OUTSIDE POCKET IS A NORMAL FUNCTIONING POCKET HOWEVER ITS HIDDEN INVISIBLE
ZIPPER AT THE SIDE SEEM WHICH THEY CUN ZIN, REACH IN AND PULL THE WEAPON FROM CONCEALMENT.
>> Stephen: JUST DON'T GET THE POCKETS CONFUSED OR YOU COULD TRY TO STOP A CRIMINAL
WITH HALF A GRANOLA BAR AND HOME DEPOT RECEIPT.
AND NOT TO MENTION THESE PANTS HAVE A COMFORT WASTE.
WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO WASTE PEOPLE IN KFERMENT AND IT'S NOT JUST WOOLRICH.
EVEN WORKOUTWEAR MAKER UNDER ARMOR IS INTRODUCING CLOTHESING DESIGNED TO HIDE
GUNS AND I'M THRILLED.
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE JOGGING WITH A HANDGUN DUCK TAPED TO MY-- I
DON'T-- I DON'T--  (APPLAUSE) I DO NOT WISH TO DISCUSS WHERE I KEEP THE BANANA CLIP.
(LAUGHTER) ALL OF THE CLOTHING IS DESIGNED TO PROJECT WHAT SOME GUN OWNERS CALL MAXIMUM UNCERTAINTY.
AS A WOOLRICH SPOKESMAN SAID WHEN SOMEBODY WALKS DOWN THE STREET IN A BUTTON DOWN
KHAKIES, A BAD GUY GETS A GLIMMER OF FEAR WONDERING ARE THEY PACKING OR NOT.
AT LEAST, WE CAN STOP BEING SCARED OF PEOPLE WEARING HOODIES AND START BEING
SCARED OF PEOPLE WEARING BUTTON DOWNS AND KHAKIES.
(LAUGHTER) FROM NOW ON, ANYONE IN AMERICA--  (APPLAUSE) ANYONE, ANYONE COULD BE CARRYING.
THAT BROWNIE COULD BE CARRYING A BROWNIE.
THAT MD COULD HAVE AN AK THAT SUNDAY SCHOOLTEACHER COULD BE PACKING A SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL.
SO REMEMBER, FOLKS, IF YOU SEE ANYONE WEARING CLOTHS,
BE READY TO DRAW DOWN ON THEM.
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE WEARING CLOTHS, THEY'RE GOING TO BE READY TO DRAW DOWN ON YOU.
AND FINALLY, WE'LL ALL BE SAFE, AS LONG AS NOBODY MAKES ANY SUDDEN
