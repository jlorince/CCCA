FOLKS, I KNOW YOU WATCH THIS SHOW TO KEEP ABREAST OF WHAT TO BE SCARED AND/OR ANGRY ABOUT, SO
YOU CAN BE THE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK TO ASK, WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE MOVING ON TO YOUR BLOCK?
WELL, LAST WEDNESDAY I DID IT AGAIN.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT A PROPOSED ARIZONA LAW WHICH WOULD REQUIRE STATE POLICE TO STOP AND
QUESTION ANYONE THEY SUSPECT OF BEING AN ILLEGAL ALIEN, AND UNLESS THAT PERSON PRODUCES A
VALID U.S. I.D., THEY COULD GO TO JAIL.
WELL, NOW EVERYBODY'S JUMPING ON MY STORY BECAUSE LAST FRIDAY ARIZONA GOVERNOR JAN BREWER
SIGNED THE BILL INTO LAW, WHICH CRITICS SAY WILL CAUSE RACIAL PROFILING AND HARASSMENT OF LATINOS.
FOR REACTION TO THIS NEW LAW,
LIVE FROM PHOENIX, PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND, AN EXPERT IN HISPANIC ISSUES, ESTEBAN COLBERTO.
ESTEBAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> GRACIAS, STEPHEN.
BIENVENIDOS A UNA EDICION ESPECIAL ARIZONA DEL COLBERTO REPORTO GIGANTE!

>> Stephen: NOW, ESTEBAN, WHAT'S THE REACTION FROM THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THERE?
>> CHICAS, CHICAS.
BIEN, EL TREINTA POR CIENTO DE LA POBLACION DE ARIZONA ES HISPANICO, PUES.
>> HEY, CAN I SEE SOME ID?
>> QUE?
NO LLEVO CARTERA DURANTE EL PROGRAMA.
ESTE ES MI TRAJE DE TELE.
>> GOOD.
'CUZ I'M GONNA "SHOW" YOU THE BORDER.
LET'S GO.
COME ON.
>> CHICAS! CHICAS!
SOCORRO!
>> COME ON, COWBOY.
HERE WE GO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WE SEEM TO BE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THERE.
THE POINT IS ARIZONA POLICE WILL NOW BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
SO HOW CAN YOU TELL WHO'S AN ILLEGAL ALIEN AND WHO'S NOT?
THAT QUESTION BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DOCUDRAMA.
FOLKS, CRITICS OF THE GOVERNOR ARE OVERLOOKING THE FACT THAT,
YES, SHE SIGNED THIS ANTI-ILLEGALS BILL, BUT SHE ALSO ORDERED POLICE TO ENFORCE IT
WITHOUT THE USE OF RACIAL PROFILING.
THEREFORE, IT WON'T HAPPEN,
RIGHT, BILL KRISTOL?
>> WILL A FEW PEOPLE GET STOPPED PERHAPS BECAUSE SOME POLICE OFFICER HAS REASONABLE SUSPICION
THAT A PERSON IS ILLEGAL?
WILL HE BE STOPPED PERHAPS ON THE STREET AND ASKED TO PROVIDE A DRIVER'S LICENSE?
YES.
THAT IS THE HUGE, HORRIBLE CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR FIVE TIMES, EIGHT TIMES
OR 13 TIMES IN ARIZONA.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
FIVE.
EIGHT, 13.
5,813.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
NOW, THOSE...
[LAUGHTER]
THOSE ARE JUST RARE AND UNAVOIDABLE MISTAKES, BUT WHEN YOU MAKE HUEVOS RANCHEROS, YOU
HAVE TO VIOLATE THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF A FEW EGGS.
[APPLAUSE]
SO THE POINT IS, CAN YOU ENFORCE THIS LAW WITHOUT RACIAL PROFILING?
YES.
I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT LOOKS LIKE.
GOVERNOR?
>> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT LOOKS LIKE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THAT'S JUST THE GOVERNOR.
IT'S NOT HER JOB TO KNOW THAT.
IT'S HER JOB TO SIGN BILLS WITHOUT KNOWING THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES.
LUCKILY SOME PEOPLE, SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE GIFT OF SPOTTING ILLEGALS.
FOR INSTANCE, CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN BILBRAY.
>> THEY'RE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ATTIRE.
THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF...
YOU WENT RIGHT DOWN TO THE SHOES.
>> Stephen: WHEN YOU'RE LEGAL YOU WEAR NIKES, WHEN YOU'RE
ILLEGAL, YOU MAKE NIKES, AND GEORGE WILL... GEORGE WILL IS CONFIDENT THE POLICE WILL BE
ABLE TO MAKE THESE DISTINCTIONS WITHOUT RACIAL PROFILING.
>> PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE USED TO MAKING THE KIND OF DIFFICULT JUDGMENT, SUSPICION OF
INTOXICATED DRIVING, ALL KINDS OF JUDGMENTS ARE CONSTANTLY MADE BY POLICEMEN.
>> Stephen: YES, CATCHING DRUNK DRIVERS IS A GREAT MODEL.
WE JUST NEED A BREATHALYZER THAT CAN DETECT INCREASED LEVEL OF CILANTRO, BUT NO LAW CAN REALLY
BE ENFORCED WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS PICTURE POSTED ON THE INTERNET SHOWING ONE HELPFUL
ARIZONAN'S ANSWER -- I AM MEXICAN.
PULL ME OVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT SAVED A LOT OF GUESS WORK.
UNFORTUNATELY... UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT ALL ILLEGALS ARE SUCH UPSTANDING CITIZENS.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE A HELPFUL SOLUTION.
INSTEAD OF THE POLICE PULLING YOU OVER TO FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE PAPERS, WOULDN'T IT BE SIMPLER
TO PULL THE POLICE OVER TO TELL THEM YOU DO.
OR JUST GO TO THE POLICE PRECINCT, SHOW THEM YOUR I.D.
AND THEY CAN STAMP YOUR HAND OR GIVE YOU A BRACELET, AND THAT PROVES YOU'RE HERE LEGALLY AND
YOU GET TO DRINK FREE OR LADIES' NIGHT.
OR BETTER YET, LEAVE THE POLICE OUT OF IT.
THEY DON'T MAKE THE LAWS.
THEY JUST ENFORCE FENNEL.
INSTEAD EVERYONE IN ARIZONA SHOULD GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION AND SHOW HER YOUR PAPERWORK.
OR EVEN BETTER YET, PROVE TO HER YOU'RE A CITIZEN WHEN YOU VOTE.
AND THAT'S "THE WORD||||||
