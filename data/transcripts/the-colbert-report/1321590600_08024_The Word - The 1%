HOMUNCULOUS.
SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY IT.
INFORMATION, LIKE ALL AMERICANS,
I HAVE PINNED MY HOPES AND
DREAMS ON THE 12 MEMBERS OF THE
SUPER CONGRESS.
KERRY, MURRAY,-- I DON'T HAVE TO
NAME THEM.
WE ALL GREW UP WITH THE ACTION
FIGURES.
THE ORIGIN STORY OF THE SUPER
CONGRESS IS WELL KNOWN.
IT WAS CREATED LAST SUMMER
BECAUSE OF A FREAK RIFT IN THE
DEBT CEILING CONTINUUM.
THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO RAISE
THE DEBT CEILING.
THE HOUSE REFUSED TO DO THAT
WITHOUT BUDGET CUTS, AND THE
U.S. CAME PERLSLY CLOSE TO
DEFAULTING UNTIL AT THE LAST
MINUTE BOTH SIDES FOUND THE
COURAGE TO COME TOGETHER AND LET
SOMETHING SMN ELSE FIGURE THIS
( BLEEP ) OUT LATER.
THEIR LATER IS OUR NOW.
UNLESS THIS IS A RERUN, IN WHICH
CASE YOU KNOW HOW THIS TURNS OUT
BUT DON'T TELL ME BECAUSE I'M
TIVOING THE END OF AMERICA.
NOW, THE SUPER CONGRESS' DARING
SUBMISSION TO FIND 1.2 PATROL IN
BUDGET CUTS.
AND SO FAR, SHAVE AGREED TO...
JACK JIM?
>> THE SUPER COMMITTEE ON
CAPITOL HILL, IS GRINDING TO A
HALT.
>> I DON'T THINK THE GANG OF--
THE SUPER COMMIT SEGOING TO
SUCCEED.
>> SUPER COMMITTEE VICTIM TO
PARTISAN BICKERING, AND THE
DESIRE FOR NOBODY TO DRINK THEIR
TOUGH MEDICINE.
>> Stephen:  AND IF NOBODY
DRINKS THEIR TOUGH MEDICINE BY
LAW IT MUST INSTEAD BE DELIVERED
RECTALLY.
YOU SEE, A FAILURE BY THE SUPER
COMMITTEE TRIGGERS AUTOMATIC
DEEP CUTS TO MILITARY SPENDING.
SENATE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WILL
TRY TO UNTRIG THEY'RE TRIGGER.
BUT OBAMA PROMISES A VETO TO
RETRIGGER THE UNTRIGGERRED
TRIGGER
(  LAUGHTER  )
TO AVOID THESE CUTS IN DEFENSE,
SOMEONE HAS TO SACRIFICE, AND WE
ALL KNOW WHO THAT SOMEONE SHOULD
BE.
AND THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE 1%.
FOLKS.
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT.
THERE IS A TINY MINORITY OF
AMERICANS WHO COULD BE DOING A
LOT MORE FOR OUR NATION, A
MINORITY WHO LIVE A LIFESTYLE
THE 99% COULD NOT IMAGINE.
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT.
( LAUGHTER )
I'M TALKING ABOUT MILITARY
VETERANS.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU SEE, ONLY ONE% OF AMERICANS
SERVED IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN.
NOW, THANKFULLY, THE SUPER
COMMITTEE IS SERVEING THE
INTEREST OF THE 99% OF US WHO
DIDN'T SERVE.
>> LAWMAKERS ON THE DEBT SUPER
COMMITTEE ARE LOOKING FOR $1.2
PATROL IN SPENDING CUTS.
THEY'VE RECOMMENDED COST-SAVING
CHANGES THIS MILITARY HEALTH
BENEFITS.
>> Stephen:  THEY WANT TO
REDUCE MILITARY HEALTH BENEFITS
KNOWN AS TRICARE.
AND THE SUPER CONGRESS RECENTLY
RECEIVED A LETTER SUPPORTING
THOSE CUTS FROM THE BIPARTISAN
LEADERS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE
VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEES.
THEY SAY OF THAT TREND, "WE
BELIEVE NO CONSTITUENCY BETTER
UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGE
AMERICA FACES AND NO
CONSTITUENCY IS BETTER SUITED TO
AGAIN LEAD BY EXAMPLE BY PUTTING
COUNTRY FIRST."
WITH THIS LETTER, CONGRESS IS
SENDING OUR TROOPS A CLEAR
MESSAGE-- THAT MESSAGE THAT WE
CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT
SERVICE MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO
GIVE UP MORE THAN THE REST OF
US.
NOW I KNOW CERTAINLY WE RICH
PEOPLE CAN'T GIVE THINGS UP.
I'M NOT USED TO IT.
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN UP ANYTHING
IN MY LIFE.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, FOLKS--
( LAUGHTER )
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I KNOW OUR TROOPS HAVE GIVEN UP
SO MUCH ALREADY.
10 YEARS, TWO WARS, AND NO ONE
HONORED THEIR SACRIFICE MORE
THAN I.
AND I'LL PROVE IT.
#-R I HONOR YOUR SACRIFICE
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
BUT HERE'S THE THING-- ONCE
YOU'RE BACK IN THE STATES, IF
YOU'RE NOT CONTINUING TO
SACRIFICE, WHY SHOULD I CONTINUE
HONORING YOU?
YOU SEE, ON THE OTHER HAND, ON
THE OTHER HAND, VETERANS,
IMAGINE THE PRIDE IN EVERY
PATRIOT'S HEART WHEN YOU LET US
CUT PARTS OF YOUR HEALTH PLAN.
YOU GUYS, IF YOU LET US DO THAT,
YOU GUYS WILL TOTALLY DESERVE
MEDALS FOR THIS.
WELL, NOT METALS.
BRASS IS EXPENSIVE, BUT
DEFINITELY STICKERS.
AND I PROMISE--
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
YOU VETERANS-- YOU VETERANS WILL
NOT BE SACRIFICING ALONE.
THE PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR
SACRIFICE FROM ACTIVE SERVICE
MILITARY.
SO WHILE WE'RE AT IT.
YOU KNOW THE 41,000 TROOPS THE
PRESIDENT IS TAKING OUT OF IRAQ?
THAT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE SO
I SAY LET'S MAKE THEM BUY THEIR
OWN PLANE TICKETS HOME.
AND WHILE-- AND WHILE THESE
DEBT-REDUCING MORE MEASURES MAY SEEM
HARSH, REMEMBER, CONGRESS HAS NO
CHOICE.
>> IF THIS COMMISSION FAILS,
THERE'S A TRIGGER CUTTING
DEFENSE BY $600 BILLION.
>> Stephen:  AND CUTTING
DEFENSE SPENDING IS OUT OF THE
QUESTION.
BECAUSE IT IS OUR GIANT MILITARY
MACHINE THAT CREATES OUR
VETERANS, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WE'RE
WILLING TO SACRIFICE FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
