(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: I LIKE IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AFTER A GREETING LIKE THAT I JUST WISH IT WAS LEGAL TO GRIND YOU UP AND
SNORT YOU.
(LAUGHTER) BEFORE WE BEGIN RIGHT OFF THE TOP I WANT TO THANK MY GUEST VIKRAM GANDHI FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
HE'S STARRING IN THE NEW DOCUMENTARY "KUMARE: THE TRUE STORY OF A FLASE PROPHET."
HE'S ALREADY ONE OF MY FAVORITE GUESTS-- BECAUSE HE SHOWED UP.
(LAUGHTER) UNLIKE MIKE TYSON WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS ONE-MAN BROADWAY SHOW
BUT CANCELED THIS MORNING BECAUSE-- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET THIS RIGHT-- HE IS A HUGE PUSSY.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT.
I CHALLENGE MIKE TYSON TO AN INTERVIEW AND HE FORFEITED BECAUSE HE'S TOO SCARED TO FACE
ME I GET IT.
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE GOOD EAR, AND THAT TAKES AWAY YOUR BEST MOVE.
(LAUGHTER) SO NATION, I BELIEVE THIS KNOCKOUT KA-PANG BY KNOW SHOW NOW MAKES ME OFFICIALLY THE
REVEREND SIR DR. STEVEN P. MOS DEF COLBERT D.F.A..
(ECHOING) HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP-EEN OF THE WORLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RIGHT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I ASSUME THE BELT'S IN THE MAIL,
MIKE.
BUT IF NOT I'M A 26 WAIST.
(LAUGHTER) NATION, TO BE CLEAR, I HAVE NO HARD FEELINGS, PLEASE GO AHEAD
AND SEE MIKE'S BROADWAY SHOW.
