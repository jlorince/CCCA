EVERYBODY
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY
BROADWAY LYRICIST AND COMPOSER
WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "LOOK,
I MADE A HAT."
IT'S BETTER THAN ANDREW LLOYD
WEBER'S BOOK, "LOOK, I MADE
CATS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLEASE WELCOME STEPHEN SONDHEIM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE SEE YOU AGAIN, SIR.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> MY PLEASURE.
THIS IS JUST LIKE OLD HOME WEEK.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: THIS IS WHERE YOU
COME TO SELL YOUR BOOKS.
AND BOY DO YOU HAVE ONE THIS
TIME.
LAST TIME IT WAS "FINISHING THE
HAT" AND THIS ONE IS CALLED
"LOOK I MADE A HAT."
OKAY?
>> IT'S A PROGRESSION.
>> STEPHEN: IT IS.
THIS BOOK HAS IN IT "LOOK I MADE
A HAT" THIS IS THE SECOND HALF
OF YOUR CAREER.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE MUSICAL OF
ALL TIME, SUNDAY IN THE PARK
WITH GEORGE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THANK YOU.
>> STEPHEN: WHEN I WAS
EXPLAINING TO MY MOTHER WHY I
WANTED TO BE A PUNDIT I READ HER
THE LYRICS TO FINISHING THE HAT.
THAT IS ABOUT AN ARTIST HAVING
TO LIVE WITH THE LONELINESS OF
HIS ART THAT HIS ART IS HIS LOVE
AND HIS LIFE.
ARE YOU WRITING ABOUT YOURSELF
THERE?
>> YES, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.
I'M WRITING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
TO EVERYBODY WHO WRITES OR
PAINTS OR COMPOSES, HOW YOU GET
LOST IN WHAT YOU ARE DOING, THE
WORD DISAPPEARS AND YOU
SACRIFICE ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE
AND YOU FORGET EVERYTHING EXCEPT
FINISHING THE HAT.
IN THIS CASE IT'S ABOUT A
PAINTER WHO IS WORKING ON A HAT.
IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY HATS BUT
HE SPENDS ALL HIS TIME
CONCENTRATING ON THIS HAT.
HE SAID LOOK, I MADE A HAT, NOW
I HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE.
IT'S ABOUT CONCENTRATION.
>> STEPHEN: IT NEVER ENDS
THOUGH.
THE ART NEVER ENDS.
SHE'S A HARSH MISTRESS, ART.
>> THAT'S WELL PUT.
>> STEPHEN: I SHOULD WRITE
LYRICS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ON
YOU INVITED ME TO BE IN COMPANY.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: WHICH I DID A --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> I WAS THRILLED THAT YOU
ACCEPTED.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
ACCEPT.
>> STEPHEN: I CAN'T BELIEVE I
DID EITHER.
MY PERFORMANCE HAS HARRY GREAT
INTERPRETATION OF SONDHEIM OR
THE GREATEST INTERPRETATION OF
SONDHEIM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'LL JUST WRITE THIS DOWN.
>> WELL, YOU HAD TO COMPETE WITH
CHARLES WHO HAD DONE IT
ORIGINALLY AND I THINK IT CAME
OUT WELL.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR GREAT.
NOW, CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE
LYRICS TO THE SONG I SANG.
IT'S CALLED SORRY GRATEFUL.
I LIKE THINGS SIMPLE, SIR.
THE CHORUS GOES YOU ALWAYS ARE
WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE CAN HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL TO DO
WITH HER.
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LIKE AN
EQUATION, ALL TO DO, NOTHING TO
DO AND THOSE ARE FRACTIONS OVER
THE WORD WITH HER.
OKAY?
MATH SAYS WE ELIMINATING THE ALL
TO DO,yMñr NOTHING TO DO AND ALL
THAT IS LEFT IS WITH HER.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
PART OF IT IS SORRY AND PART OF
IT IS GRATEFUL.
>> STEPHEN: RIGHT.
BUT IT'S LIKE HE CAN'T EXPLAIN
WHAT MARRIAGE IS LIKE.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: WHY NOT MAKE YOUR
CHARACTERS REALLY SIM MINDED?
HAKUNA MATATA.
IT'S A WONDERFUL WORD.
>> IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
BUT PEOPLE ARE COMPLICATED.
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF.
>> STEPHEN: WHY NOT PEPPY,
PEPPY, PEPPY STUFF.
LIKE HEY, YOU GIRLS, BEAUTIFUL
GIRL HOW I'D LIKE TO MEET YOU
BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
LET ME CALL THE PREACHER.
>> IF YOU ASKED I WOULD HAVE
UPPED THE TEMPO FOR YOU.
>> STEPHEN: SERIOUSLY?
>> YES.
EASY THING TO DO.
SORRY GRATEFUL.
>> STEPHEN: GRATEFUL HAPPY WHY
LOOK FOR ANSWERS WHEN NONE
OCCUR.
YOU ALWAYS ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS
WERE WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ALL TO DO WITH HER ♪
HOW ABOUT THAT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO TASK FOR
TWO OF YOUR WORKS.
>> OKAY.
>> STEPHEN: ASSASSINS THAT'S
IN THIS BOOK.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MUSICAL, DON'T
GET ME WRONG.
IT'S A MUSICAL ABOUT ASSASSINS.
YOU HAVE KIDS WHO ARE
IMPRESSIONABLE.
THEY ARE GOING TO GO TO
BROADWAY, SEE THIS THING AND
GROW UP TO SING AND DANCE AND
SHOOT THE PRESIDENT.
YOU DON'T FEEL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT?
>> YEAH, THEY GET KILLED AT THE
END.
>> STEPHEN: SO IT'S A HAPPY
ENDING.
FOR STEVEN SONDHEIM IT'S A HAPPY
ENDING.
ALL THOSE ASSASSINS CAME TO A
BAD END.
SO, IF THERE'S A LESSON THERE
IT'S DON'T ASSASSINATE.
>> STEPHEN: THAT'S WHAT I
MEAN, KEEP IT SIMPLE.
YOU WANT THE DEFINE BOOK GET
THIS ONE, LOOK I MADE A
