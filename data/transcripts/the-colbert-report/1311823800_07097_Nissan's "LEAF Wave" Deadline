[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
>> Stephen: NICE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THIS NEWS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I UNDERSTAND.
BELIEVE ME I UNDERSTAND THE
FEELING.
THIS IS HOW I START MY DAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS WE'VE GOT TO GET TO IT
BECAUSE
AMERICA IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING A
DAY OF RECKONING THAT WILL HAVE
MASSIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL OF
US.
BECAUSE TOMORROW IS THE DEADLINE
FOR OWNERS OF THE NISSAN LEAF TO
SUBMIT IDEAS FOR THE OFFICIAL
LEAF WAVE THAT LEAF OWNERS WILL
USE WHEN SAYING HELLO TO EACH
OTHER.
[LAUGHTER]
OBAMA'S SHOWN NO LEADERSHIP ON
THIS!
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, AS A PROUD
PETROLEUM-AMERICAN, I ALREADY
HAVE MY OWN WAVE I USE TO GREET
ELECTRIC CARS.
KA-POW.
BUT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT NISSAN IS TALKING ABOUT THE
LONG TRADITION OF OWNERS OF THE
SAME CARS ACKNOWLEDGING EACH
OTHER ON THE ROAD.
FOR INSTANCE, JEEP HAS THE TWO
FINGER WAVE,
THE VW BEETLE HAS THE HANG
LOOSE,
[LAUGHTER]
THE PT CRUISER HAS THE "PLEASE
GOD DON'T LET ANYONE SEE ME
DRIVING THIS THING."
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOW, THE ELECTRIC CROWD
WANTS IN ON THE FUN WITH AN
EXCLUSIVE WAVE TO BE USED
BETWEEN LEAF OWNERS AND I HAVE
NO DOUBT IT WILL CATCH ON.
BECAUSE THE
GRASSROOTS-ORGANIC-SLOW-FOOD-LOC
AVORE TYPES WHO BUY ELECTRIC
CARS LOVE MANUFACTURED
TRADITIONS CREATED BY THE
MARKETING WINGS OF MULITNATIONAL
CORPORATIONS.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND SO DO THESE PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST LISTEN TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC
COMMENTS ON THE LEAF'S FACEBOOK
PAGE.
"WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYONE ELSE
DRIVING A LEAF AROUND HOUSTON."
[LAUGHTER]
AND
"I'M STILL WAITING TO FIND
ANOTHER LEAF ON THE ROAD."
NOT TO MENTION, THE
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM NON-LEAF
OWNERS LIKE THIS ACTUAL POST:
SUCK MY BALLS, HIPPIES.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S BOTH A GENEROUS
INVITATION AND A GREAT IDEA FOR
A WAVE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NISSAN HAS THEIR OWN
SUGGESTIONS.
FIRST, THE HIGHLY INNOVATIVE
IDEA TO WAVE BY WAVING. OR A
GESTURE THAT SAYS "I'M DRIVING A
NISSAN LEAF AND PRETENDING IT'S
A JEEP CHEROKEE" AND A THIRD ONE
WHICH SAYS: "HOW MUCH OF A ZERO
AM I FOR WAVING AT SOMEONE JUST
'CAUSE WE OWN THE SAME CAR?"
[LAUGHTER]
WELL MY SENSE OF COMPETITION
TRUMPS MY DISDAIN FOR SMUG
LIBERALS TRYING TO SAVE THE
EARTH.
SO I'D LIKE TO SUBMIT A WAVE OF
MY OWN.
I'M --
IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OF A HAND
POEM.
WHEN YOU SEE A FELLOW LEAF OWNER
ON THE ROAD, TAKE BOTH HANDS OFF
WHEEL AND TELL THE STORY OF
PACHAMAMA THE BENEVOLENT EARTH
MOTHER OF THE ANDES WHO CRIED
BECAUSE OF CARBON POLLUTION
FALLING ON HER FACE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO SHE CLOSED HER EYES TO THE
EVIL OF THE WORLD.
[LAUGHTER]
AT THIS POINT YOU'LL WANT A HAND
SIGNAL TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE
FIREMAN CUTTING YOU FREE OF YOUR
CAR WITH THE JAWS OF LIFE.
POINT IS, NISSAN. NO HAND
SIGNALS!
TEN AND TWO!
