PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR BEING IN

WELCOME EVERYBODY HERE.
NATION, EVER SINCE PRESIDENT
OBAMA WON RE-ELECTION IN
NOVEMBER, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN
PINNING THEIR HOPES FOR 2016 ON
NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND GROWN-UP
CAMPBELL'S KID CHRIS CHRISTIE.
SADLY, A NEW SCANDAL HAS
EXPLODED THAT COULD DERAIL
CHRISTIE'S AMBITIONS.
HE WAS RECENTLY CAUGHT ON TAPE
BLATANTLY LYING TO ONE OF HIS
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HIS PAST.
>> THIS IS YOUR TIME HERE.
GET THE MICROPHONE.
>> WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW.
I LIKE TO WATCH SPORTS.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW.
>> SCOOBY DOO.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
FOUR.
WHEN I WAS FOUR, MY FAVORITE
SHOW WAS SCOOBY DOO TOO.
>> Stephen: SHOCKING.
SHOCKING THAT SCOOBY DOO IS
STILL ON THE AIR.
ALTHOUGH IN THE NEW EPISODE WHEN
THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS GUEST
STAR, THEY'RE JOINED BY THEIR
BUDDY KIM JONG-UN.
WELL, IT TURNS OUT CHRISTIE WAS
FULL OF SCOOBY DOO DOO AND HE
WAS EXPOSED BY PULITZER PRIZE
WINNING WATCHDOG GROUP
POLITIFACT WHO REPORTED GIVEN
THE GOVERNOR'S BIRTHDAY AND THE
OFFICIAL PREMIERE DATE OF SCOOBY
DOO CHRISTIE WOULD HAVE BEEN
SEVEN YEARS OLD NOT FOUR IF HE
WATCHED THE'S FIRST EPISODE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
CHRISTIE WAS WAS CLEARLY LYING
ABOUT WATCHING SCOOBY DOO WHEN
HE WAS FOUR.
AND HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY
WITH IT TOO IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THOSE MEDDLING KIDS.
MARK MY WORDS, SCOOBY-GATE,
TRADEMARK, WILL BRING CHRIS
CHRISTIE TO HIS KNEES FASTER
THAN A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
REST ASSURED, NATION, REST
ASSURED, I WILL GET SOLVE THIS
MYSTERY JUST LIKE MY FAVORITE
CHILDHOOD CARTOON.
INSPECTOR GADGET.
>> INSPECTOR GADGET CAME ON THE
AIR IN 1983.
YOU WERE ALMOST 20 YEARS OLD.
