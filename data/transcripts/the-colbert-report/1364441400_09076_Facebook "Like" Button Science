NATION -- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT WE'VE GOT A SPONSOR TONIGHT.
WE DO THAT EVERY SO OFTEN.
THIS IS A GOOD ONE, IT'S THE CADILLAC OF CORPORATE SPONSORS-- BECAUSE IT'S CADILLAC.
GO BUY ONE.
IS THAT ENOUGH?
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
OKAY.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
WE'LL WEAVE IT IN LATER.
ALL RIGHT.
NATION, I'M A HUGE SCIENCE BUFF.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MAY KNOW THAT NICOLAS COPERNICUS FORMULATED THE HELIOCENTRIC MODEL, WHICH
POSTULATED THAT THE EARTH TRAVELED AROUND THE SUN.
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT HE'S ALSO A HERETIC WHO WILL BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY?
THAT'S SCIENCE!
SO I WAS THRILLED TO LEARN ABOUT AN EXCITING SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH.
>> THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE OVER IN LONDON ACTUALLY DID A STUDY ON NEARLY 60,000 FACEBOOK USERS.
AND WHAT THEY FOUND IN CONCLUSION WAS THAT ALL OF YOUR "LIKES"  THAT YOU'RE CLICKING
CAN TELL MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE REALIZED, FROM  YOUR POLITICAL VALUES TO RELIGION TO
YOUR GENDER, HAPPINESS AND AGE.
>> IN FACT, SOME PARTS OF YOUR IDENTITY COULD BE PREDICTED WITH 95 PERCENT ACCURACY.
>> Stephen: YES, FACEBOOK LIKES CAN REVEAL YOUR PERSONALITY TRAITS, JUST AS FRIENDSTER LIKES
CAN REVEAL THAT YOU STOPPED USING THE INTERNET IN 2003.
[LAUGHTER]
TO GATHER DATA, THE SCIENTISTS GAVE VOLUNTEERS A SERIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS THROUGH A
FACEBOOK APP THEY CREATED.
AND BECAUSE IT'S FACEBOOK, THE TESTS STARTED AS MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS AND SLOWLY BECAME
NOTHING BUT PHOTOS OF THE SCIENTISTS' CHILDREN.
[LAUGHTER]
THE SCIENTISTS TOOK THOSE TEST RESULTS THEN COMPARED THEM TO USERS' FACEBOOK "LIKES," TO
LEARN WHICH LIKES MATCHED UP WITH WHICH TYPES OF PEOPLE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY FOUND THAT HOMOSEXUAL MEN TENDED TO LIKE KATHY GRIFFIN, ADAM LAMBERT,
AND "WICKED," THE MUSICAL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, SCIENCE.
FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, CANCER-- STILL NOT CURED.
OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, NATION, I DON'T NEED SOME STUDY TO TELL ME WHO'S GAY AND WHO ISN'T.
THAT'S WHAT SCARVES ARE FOR.
[LAUGHTER]
THE STUDY ALSO CONTAINED THE BLOCKBUSTER REVELATION THAT PEOPLE WITH MANY FRIENDS LIKED
JENNIFER LOPEZ, WHILE VOLUNTEERS WITH FEW FRIENDS LIKED WALKING WITH YOUR FRIEND AND
RANDOMLY PUSHING THEM INTO SOMEONE OR SOMETHING.
HEY, NOT THEIR FAULT THEY DON'T HAVE FRIENDS.
EVERYONE THEY KNOW KEEPS GETTING RANDOMLY PUSHED INTO TRAFFIC.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE STUDY REVEALED WHAT YOUR FACEBOOK LIKES SAY ABOUT HOW SMART YOU ARE.
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT HIGH IQ CORRESPONDS TO LIKING MOZART, SCIENCE, AND-- "THE COLBERT
REPORT!"
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT CAN I SAY?
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] I DON'T BLAME YOU I AM SMART!
NATION, IF YOU LIKE MY SHOW, YOU ARE SMART.
END OF STORY.
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT SMART PEOPLE DO.
[LAUGHTER]
AND MY VIEWERS AREN'T JUST SMART, I'M TALKING THE KIND OF HEAVYWEIGHT INTELLECTS WHO,
ACCORDING TO THIS STUDY, ALSO LIKE CURLY FRIES.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT JUST MAKES SENSE, CURLY FRIES ARE THE ONLY SIDE DISH WHERE YOU HAVE TO CALCULATE THE
TANGENT OF THE EXTERNAL ARC BEFORE CRAMMING IT INTO YOUR FRY-HOLE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, TIME TO GET MY THINK ON.
MMMM, I CAN FEEL MY BRAIN GETTING BIGGER.
BRAIN IS IN THE HIPS, RIGHT?
THERE'S NOTHING I ASSOCIATE MORE WITH REFINED, INTELLIGENT CULTURE THAN A CRISP GLISTENING
CURLY FRY.
IT'S THE SAMPLER PLATTER.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY STICK OUT THEIR PINKIES IN THE FIRST PLACE?
TO HOLD THE NEXT CURLY FRY.
MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS?
I'M AN AVERAGE JOE.
I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS SOME KIND OF IVORY TOWER CURLY FRY ELITIST.
AFTER ALL, YOU CAN ONLY GET CURLY FRIES -- THE CADILLAC OF FRIES -- WAS THAT ENOUGH?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO.
YOU ONLY FIND CURLY FRIES AT FINER RESTAURANTS, YOUR ARBY'S, YOUR JACK IN THE BOX.
AND GOOD LUCK GETTING A RESERVATION THERE.
I'VE CALLED -- THEY WON'T EVEN LET ME TALK TO JACK!
