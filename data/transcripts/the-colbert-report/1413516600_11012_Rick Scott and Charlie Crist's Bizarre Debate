>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
ALL RIGHT!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOUSO MUCH.
HAVE A SEAT.
NATION, IT'S MED-TERM SEASONAND, EARLIER THIS WEEK, I GAVE
YOU COMPLETE COVERAGE OF ONE OFTHE MOST EXPLOSIVE RACES -- THE
CONTEST IN FLORIDA BETWEENREPUBLICAN INCUMBENT GOVERNOR
RICK SCOTT AND DEMOCRATIC FORMERGOVERNOR CHARLIE CRIST.
LAST NIGHT, THE TWO WERESCHEDULED TO FACE OFF IN A
DEBATE.
IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESEGUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES TO SHOW
VOTERS WHO IS MORENATORIAL-GUBER-Y.
(LAUGHTER)AND THIS BEING FLORIDA, RIGHT
OFF THE BEAN, THINGS GOT VERYFLORIDA.
(LAUGHTER)>> WE WANT TO TAKE A SHOT OF THE
STAGE HERE AT BAILEY HALL INBROWARD COUNTY, AND AS YOU CAN
SEE, THE TWO CANDIDATES, WHOWERE INVITED TO TAKE PART IN
THIS DEBATE, RIGHT NOW ARE NOTSTEPPING UP ON THE STAGE.
(LAUGHTER)LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE AN
EXTREMELY PECULIAR SITUATIONRIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE GOVERNOR CHARLIE CRIST(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT, OURINCUMBENT GOVERNOR, AND THE
REPUBLICAN COUNTY FOR GOVERNORIS ALSO IN THE BUILDING,
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT.
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT GOVERNORSCOTT WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING
IN THIS DEBATE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, ONLY
CHARLIE CRIST WAS ON STAGE!
GIVING C-SPAN ITS MOST DRAMATICTELEVISION MOMENT SINCE THE
CANCELLATION OF BOOKNOTESDEATHMATCH.
FOLKS, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MYGUY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND
PYTHON ON ECSTASY, RICK SCOTT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT HE HAD AN EXCELLENT REASON
FOR NOT BEING THERE.
>> GOVERNOR CRIST HAS ASKED TOHAVE A FAN, A SMALL FAN PLACED
UNDERNEATH HIS PODIUM.
THE RULES OF THE DEBATE THAT IWAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTT CAMPAIGN
SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FAN.
SOMEHOW THERE IS A FAN THERE.
>> GOVERNOR CRIST, DO THE RULESOF THE DEBATE SAY THAT THERE
SHOULD BE NO FAN?
>> ARE WE REALLY GOING TO DEBATEABOUT A FAN, OR ARE WE GOING TO
TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AND THEENVIRONMENT AND THE FUTURE OF
OUR STATE?
>> Stephen: FAN!
FAN!
FAN!
WHO TWO (BLEEP) ABOUT THEENVIRONMENT OR EDUCATION?
IT'S FLORIDA.
EVERYONE NEEDS A FAN!
AND I'M NOT ALONE IN BEING A FANFAN BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH SCOTT
CAME OUT THREE MINUTE LATER ANDTHEY HELD A HEATED HOUR-LONG
DEBATE ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS,ALL ANYONE IS TALKING ABOUT FOOD
IS FANGATE!
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, CLEARLY FOR SCOTT'S
CAMPAIGN, LAST NIGHT BLEW.
AND IF YOU TURN THE SWITCH THEOTHER WAY, IT SUCKED.
(CHEERING)BIG FANS OF SUCKING HERE
TONIGHT.
(CHEERING)BUT THE WHOLE THING WAS UNFAIR.
NOW I DON'T BLAME CRIST FORWANTING TO BRING HIS OWN
COOLANT.
BASED ON THAT SKIN TONE, I'D SAYHIS CORE TEMPERATURE'S AROUND
450 DEGREES.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WHY SHOULD CRIST GET TO COOL
HIMSELF WITH A FAN, BUT SCOTTISN'T ALLOWED TO CONTROL HIS
TEMPERATURE BY LAYING ON ACHILLED ROCK?
(LAUGHTER)MEANWHILE, BOTH SIDES ARE STILL
OSCILLATING OVER WHETHER THE FANWAS A VIOLATION.
SCOTT'S CAMPAIGN SIGNED A RULESDOCUMENT STATING THAT
"CANDIDATES MAY NOT BRINGELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING
FANS."
BUT CRIST'S CAMPAIGN ADDED,"WITH UNDERSTANDING THAT THE
DEBATE HOSTS WILL ADDRESS ANYTEMPERATURE ISSUES WITH A FAN IF
NECESSARY," ALL OF WHICH IS JUSTSPLITTING HAIRS.
WHICH IS ALSO UNFAIR TO RICKSCOTT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THE FAN WASN'T RICK SCOTT'S
ONLY OBJECTION LAST NIGHT.
HE HAD AN EVEN BETTER REASON FORNOT TAKING THE STAGE.
>> GOVERNOR SCOTT, WHY THE DELAYIN COMING OUT OVER A FAN?
>> I WAITED TO BE -- UNTIL WEFIGURED OUT IF HE WAS GONNA SHOW
UP.
HE SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO COMETO THE -- UH -- HE WAS -- HE
SAID HE WASN'T GONNA COME TO THEDEBATE.
SO WHY COME OUT UNTIL HE'SREADY?
>> Stephen: RIGHT, HE WAS JUSTWAITING IN THE WINGS FOR SEVEN
MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT WHETHERTHE GUY ON STAGE WAS GONNA COME
TO THE DEBATE.
(LAUGHTER)BOTTOM LINE, AS MUCH AS I WISH
IT WASN'T TRUE, LAST NIGHT INMIAMI, RICK SCOTT WAS...
BLOWN AWAY.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHOO!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
