ENTIRE LIFETIME.
I DON'T WANT TO YOU TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY, YOU
SOUND LIKE A QUITTER.
>> I AM, I AM I ACQUITTER.
AFTER 37 YEARS YOU ARE
ENTITLED TO QUIT.
>> Stephen: OH, OKAY, SURE,
AT 90, I DON'T WANT TO WORK
EVERY DAY, THAT'S THE
MESSAGE TO KIDS.
>> NASS'S THE MESSAGE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YOU WONDER
WHY THE CHINESE ARE GETTING
AHEAD.
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT QUALITIES
DOES A CASE HAVE TO HAVE TO
BE HEARD BY THE SUPREME
COURT.
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUALITY IS IT HAS TO
CONVINCE FOUR JUSTICES IT'S
WORTHY OF BEING HEARD.
>> Stephen: I HAVE AN
ARGUMENT AS TO WHY I
SHOULDN'T GET THIS-- YOU CAN
HELP ME OUT WITH THIS.
>> WELL, SURE, I'LL LISTEN
YOUR ARGUMENT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I WAS
GOING 90 IN THE-- ZONE AND I
WAS DRUNK.
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD FAST.
YOUR HONOR, I REST MY CASE.

GOOD.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT'S BEEN AWHILE,
RIGHT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: LET'S GET TO THE
HEAT OF THE MEAT HERE, WE.
BUSH V GORE.
GREAT SUPREME COURT DECISION,
OR THE GREATEST SUPREME
COURT DECISION.
>> NEITHER.
>> Stephen: IT IS GREAT OR
GREATEST.
>> NEITHER.
>> Stephen: I WILL PUT YOU
DOWN FOR GREAT.
YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK
IT IS THE GREATEST, BUSH V
GORE, GREAT DECISION, JOHN
PAUL STEVENS.
JUST FOR FUN, --
>> I WOULD SAY YOU PROBABLY
BETTER BUY ANOTHER COMPUTER.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO
YELL AT ME THROUGH THE
ENTIRE INTERVIEW.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
LET'S MOVE ON.
YOU HAVE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE
CALLED FIVE CHIEFS.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: THE SUPREME
COURT MEMOIR.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU UP SET
YOU WERE NEVER ONE OF THE
CHIEFS.
>> I WAS ACTING CHIEF FOR A
WHILE.
>> I NEVER WENT THAT FAR.
>> Stephen: THE BASKETBALL
COURT JUST ABOVE THE COURT
BUILDING.
>> IT IS REFERRED TO AS THE
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND.
>> Stephen: WHO IN ALL YOUR
YEARS REALLY BROUGHT THE
ROCK TO THE RIM, WHO WAS
DANGEROUS IN THE PAINT.
>> WHO WAS DANGEROUS ON THE
BASKETBALL COURT.
>> Stephen: YES, WHO BROUGHT
THE WALNUTS TO THE JAM HOOP.
>> THAT WAS BYRON WHITE.
>> Stephen: CODUNK.
>> HE COULD DUNK,
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WILLIAM REHNQUIST
FAMOUSLY PUT STRIPES ON HIS
ROBE.
WERE YOU EVER TEMPTED TO
SORT OF-- YOUR LOOK.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- .
>> Stephen: LIKE THIS?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen: LET'S SHIFT
GEARS.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: YOU WROTE THE
DISSENTING OPINION IN
CITIZENS UNITED, CORRECT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID IT IS A,
TELL ME WHAT YOU WROTE.
>> WELL, I SUPPOSE ONE OF
THE BRIEFEST THINGS ONE
COULD SAY IS IT CHANGED THE
LAWS OF MANAGEMENT IN MADE
CORPORATIONS MUCH MORE
LEEWAY IN SPENDING MONEY IN
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS THEN
THEY HAD IN THE PAST.
>> Stephen: WE ALL KNOW IT
IS A LONG ESTABLISHED LAW
THAT CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
TRUE.
>> FOR SOME PURPOSES,
CORPORATIONS ARE PERSONS.
>> Stephen: SHOULD A PERSON
BE DENIED THEIR LIGHTS.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SO IF A
PERSON SHOULD NOT BE DENIED
THEIR RIGHTS AND A
CORPORATION IS A PERSON,
SHOULDN'T CORPORATIONS HAVE
EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
THAT YOU HAVE.
>> NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
>> Stephen: CHECKMATE, WHEN
I CHECKMATE SOMEONE I LIKE
TO SAY IT.
>> OKAY.
AND I WOULD SAY YOU
OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT HE
I MOVED MY BISHOP AND TAKE
YOUR KING.
>> Stephen: OKAY WHAT IS
YOUR BISHOP.
>> MY BISHOP IS THAT THERE
ARE NATURAL PERSONS AND
CORPORATE PERSIAN SOME HAVE
DIFFERENT RIGHTS THAN OTHERS
DO.
THE SAME RIGHTS DON'T APPLY
TO EVERYONE IN EVERY
POSSIBLE SITUATION.
>> Stephen: BUT HERE'S THE
THING, WHAT-- NATURAL
PERSONS VERSUS CORPORATE
PERSONS.
>> THAT'S MAKING A
DISTINCTION THAT IT
HUMANIZES THE CORPORATION.
>> YOU DON'T SUGGEST THAT
CORPORATIONS CAN DO
EVERYTHING THAT PERSONS CAN
DO.
>> Stephen: THEY CAN.
THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD
DENY THEM THAT THEY WANTED
TO DO.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW A
CORPORATE PERSON WOULD DRINK
A GLASS OF WATER, FOR
EXAMPLE.
>> Stephen: WELL, THEY CAN
CONSUME WATER IN THEIR OWN
WAY.
A CORPORATION MAKES NUCLEAR
REACTORS, CONSUMES A GREAT
DEAL OF WATER.
HOW THEY DIGEST THAT WATT
CERTIFICATE DIFFERENT FROM
YOURS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE IF
I RIGHT TO JUDGE THE WAY
THAT THEY DO.
>> I THINK THEY DO.
>> Stephen: WHY.
BECAUSE YOU ARE A SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, FANTASTIC.
>> AND JURISDICTION OVER-- .
>> Stephen: ARE YOU A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, I'M
NOT.
THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO
JUDGE THINGS.
THAT'S VERY CONVENIENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: VERY CONVENIENT.
>> AS PART OF YOUR
COMMISSION YOU HAVE TO DO
SOME SDWRUJING.
>> Stephen: LAST QUESTION,.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: ARE THERE ANY
DECISIONS YOU MADE THAT YOU
LATER REGRETTED.
>> OTHER THAN THIS INTERVIEW?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen: JUSTICE STEVEN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> I'VE ENJOYED IT.
THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE GOOD
PEOPLE.
NOT A CORPORATION BUT STILL
GOOD PEOPLE.
