NOW SIR, YOU-- THE GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, YOU WERE ALSO A FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO
THE U.N., FORMER SECRETARY OF ENERGY, A CONGRESSMAN, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
YOU WERE DOWN AT THE CONVENTION, OKAY.

>> HERE'S WHAT IT DOES,
STEPHEN.
IT PERMITS SOLDIERS, IT PERMITS YOUNG HISPANICS THAT HAVE COME HERE NO FAULT OF

A CHANCE TO GET AN EDUCATION.
THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM.
>> BUT DOESN'T IT IS A SOMETHING KIND OF TROUBLING,
ABOUT MEXICANS OR OTHER HISPANIC PEOPLE WHO COME HERE THAT THEY-- THAT THEY
HAVE TURNED TO A LIFE OF CRIME BEFORE THEY CAN SPEAK.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> FEDERAL CRIME COMMITTED BY BABIES.
>> FIRST OF ALL, HISPANIC,
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST MEXICAN AMERICANS, THAT IS ABOUT 70%.
CUBAN AMERICANS, PUERTO RICAN, SPANISH AMERICANS,
CENTRAL AMERICANS, SOUTH AMERICANS, IT'S A HUGE AND BEAUTIFUL MELTING POT.

NOW REMINDED ME S IT, WHAT IS THE PROPER TERM.
I HEAR HISPANIC AND LATINO,
BOTH.
>> BOTH ARE OKAY.
>> SOMBRERO, BRO.
>> NO, THAT IS NOT GOOD,
HISPANIC, LATINO, THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT COVER THE ENTIRE AMAL GA MAN OF HISPANICS.
>> OBAMA IS SPEAKING AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW.
HE'S DOWN IN CHARLOTTE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S GOT TO SAY TO GET US TO TRUST HIM AGAIN.
>> WHAT HE HAS TO SAY TO THE HISPANIC VOTER IS HE REALIZED THAT-- REALIZES THAT CIVIL RIGHTS,
IMMIGRATION, COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION, THE DREAM ACT ARE PORN.
BUT HISPANICS, LATINOS CARE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE, GOOD SCHOOLS, JOBS, FOREIGN POLICY, DEFENSE POLICY.
IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T PUT US IN A BOX.
DON'T JUST APPEAL TO US AS LATINOS.
WE'RE AMERICANS.
WE WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.
>>> DO YOU THINK HE CHANGED THE VENUE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FILL THOSE SEATS OR
BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER.
BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE JUST DISTRIBUTED RAIN COATS TO PEOPLE, OR FOR HISPANIC
OUTREACH, MAYBE PONCHOS.
>> GOVERNOR RICHARDSON, BILL RICHARDSON, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
