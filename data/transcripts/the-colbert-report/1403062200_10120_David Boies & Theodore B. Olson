>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE LEGALTEAM WHO FOUGHT TO STRIKE DOWN
CALIFORNIA'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGEBAN.
GREAT, NOW SAN FRANCISCO WILLSEEM TOTALLY GAY.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID BOIES ANDTED OLSON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]GOOD TO SEE YOU.
MR. OLSON.
MR. BOIES, GOOD TO HAVE YOUBACK.
DAVID, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
TED, WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU ONFOR THE FIRST TIME.
I WANTED TO HAVE YOU ON FOR ALONG TIME NOW.
>> GLAD TO BE HERE FINALLY.
>> Stephen: PLEASURE. NOW YOUTWO, I
HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU TWOGENTLEMEN.
YOUR FREE RIDE IS OVER ON THISGAY ISSUE, OK?
BUT FIRST TELL THE PEOPLE WHOYOU ARE.
LET'S SEE, DAVID BOIES, THEODOREOLSON, PROMINENT LAWYERS IN THE
COUNTRY.
YOU'VE ARGUED OVER 70 CASESBEFORE THE SUPREME COURT,
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES V.
MICROSOFT, THE CITIZENS UNITEDCASE, BUSH V. GORE AND ON
OPPOSITE SIDES.
YOU'RE TRADITIONALLY CONSIDEREDA LIBERAL.
YOU'RE CONSIDERED ACONSERVATIVE.
NOW, YOU TWO HAVE GOT A NEW BOOKCALLED "REDEEMING THE DREAM: THE
CASE FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY."
THIS DESCRIBES THE BATTLE TO GETMARRIAGE EQUALITY ALL ACROSS THE
UNITED STATES, BUT FOR YOU GUYSSPECIFICALLY THE PROP 8 CASE WAS
THE LINCHPIN.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: HOW CAN THE TWO OFYOU BE FRIENDS?
[LAUGHTER]YOU FOUGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF
BUSH V. GORE.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU FOUGHT FOR GORE.
YOU FOUGHT FOR BUSH.
>> AND HE ACCEPTED THE OUTCOMEGRACIOUSLY.
>> I'M A VERY FORGIVING PERSON.
>> Stephen: I GOT A QUESTIONON THAT ONE.
BUSH V. GORE: GREAT SUPREMECOURT DECISION OR THE GREATEST
SUPREME COURT DECISION?
TED, I'LL LET YOU ANSWER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> WELL, THE SUPREME COURTDECIDES IT, AND THEY DECIDED
THAT BUSH WON THAT CASE AND WONTHAT ELECTION.
AND I THINK IT WAS A VERY SOLIDDECISION.
OF COURSE, I MAY BE A LITTLE BITBIASED, BUT I THINK DAVID AGREES
ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: I'M AFRAID WEDON'T HAVE TIME FOR HIS ANSWER,
BUT...
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE COURTSAID.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: YOU CAME TOGETHER
TO FIGHT FOR GAY OR SAME-SEXMARRIAGE RIGHTS.
AND YOU'VE WON EVERY CASE SOFAR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WHAT IS SO COMPELLING ABOUT YOUR
ARGUMENT THAT YOU WOULD COMETOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT SIDES OF
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO FIGHTFOR THIS?
>> THE THING THAT INFLUENCEDDAVID AND ME THE MOST I THINK IS
THAT WE'RE IN A COUNTRYDISCRIMINATING AGAINST OUR
FELLOW CITIZENS.
OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR CHILDRENAND OUR COWORKERS, WE'RE
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM.
WE'RE TELLING THEM THAT THEY'RENOT ENTITLED TO BE TREATED THE
SAME AND TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTSAND PRIVILEGES AND
DISADVANTAGES.
>> Stephen: WE TREAT THEM THESAME.
NONE OF THEM CAN GET MARRIED TOEACH OTHER.
THAT'S CALLED EQUAL PROTECTION.
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THATCLAUSE?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY...
>> WE WANT THEM TO BE EQUAL TOUS.
>> Stephen: THE WHOLE REASON IGOT MARRIED WAS AS A TAUNT TO
GAY PEOPLE, THAT THEY COULD NOTGET MARRIED.
IT HARMS MY MARRIAGE.
IT HARMS MY MARRIAGE.
>> EVERY STATE THIS SPREADS TOGETS CLOSER AND CLOSER TO MY
HOUSE.
>> IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY'REALREADY THERE.
THEY'RE ALREADY LIVINGNEXT TO YOUR HOUSE.
>> ARE YOU MAKING A LIST OFPROMINENT GAY PEOPLE?
>> THEY ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS.
THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS.
THEY ARE YOUR COWORKERS.
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK FORYOU HERE WHO WISH TO HAVE THE
SAME RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIESTHAT THE REST OF US DO.
>> Stephen: BUT DOESN'TSOCIETY GET TO CREATE MORAL
STANDARDS?
DON'T WE AS A SOCIETY GET TOCREATE OUR OWN MORAL STANDARDS,
AND HAVEN'T GAY PEOPLE, YOUKNOW, NICE PEOPLE OR NOT NICE
PEOPLE, BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THEMARE NICE, LET'S FACE IT.
>> THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: EXCEPT THE REST OFUS ARE OBEYING A WESTERN MORAL
STANDARD.
>> WHAT'S IMMORAL ABOUT BEINGMARRIED?
>> MARRIED TO ANOTHER GUY.
WE JUST HAD A SECTION ON THESHOW TALKING ABOUT HOW GAY
MARRIAGE IS SPREADING AND EVENSCOTT WALKER IS UNWILLING TO
EXPRESS HIS OPINION.
NOW YOU'RE ON.
OKAY.
THAT FITS TOGETHER LIKE A MALESOCKET AND FEMALE SOCKET, OKAY.
BUT A MALE SOCKET AND MALESOCKET TOGETHER, NO ELECTRICITY.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? DO YOUUNDERSTAND HOW ELECTRICITY
WORKS?
>> NOT A LOT, BUT, YOU SEE, IFIT WASN'T ELECTRICITY, THEN THEY
WOULDN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED.
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLEWHO ARE IN LOVE, COMMITTED
COUPLES WHO HAVE BEEN TOGETHERIN SOME CASES 10, 20, 30 YEARS.
PEOPLE WHO ARE RAISING FAMILIES.
AND PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY WANT TOHAVE THE SAME RECOGNITION FOR
THOSE UNIONS, THE SAMERECOGNITION FOR THEIR CHILDREN
THAT THEY'RE RAISING THATEVERYBODY ELSE HAS.
ALL THEY WANT IS THE OPPORTUNITYTO HAVE THE SAME FAMILY VALUES,
THE SAME OPENNESS, THE SAMERECOGNITION IN THEIR COMMUNITY
THAT EVERYBODY, GAY, STRAIGHT,BLACK, WHITE, REPUBLICAN,
DEMOCRAT, EVERYBODY WANTS THAT.
THAT'S ALL THAT THEY'RE ASKINGFOR.
>> Stephen: IS THIS THEARGUMENT BEING MADE BEFORE THE
SUPREME COURT?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELLYOU'RE CHEERING FOR.
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
>> THE ARGUMENT WE MADE BEFORETHE SUPREME COURT IS EXACTLY
THAT.
IN THIS COUNTRY, WE BELIEVE THATALL CITIZENS ARE CREATED EQUAL,
THAT THEY HAVE EQUALOPPORTUNITIES.
THEY HAVE EQUALRESPONSIBILITIES.
AND GAY AND LESBIAN PEOPLE, WHOCONSIST OF A LARGE PART OF OUR
POPULATION, ARE TREATEDDIFFERENTLY IN CALIFORNIA AND
THE PLACES WE WERE TALKING ABOUTBEFORE WE WON IN THE SUPREME
COURT.
TO CHANGE THE RULES INCALIFORNIA.
THEY WERE PERCEIVED ASSECOND-GLASS CITIZENS.
THEIR RELATIONSHIPS DIDN'TCOUNT.
IT WAS DAMAGING TO THEM ANDDAMAGING TO THEIR CHILDREN.
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'STRIVIAL.
IT MATTERS A GREAT DEAL ANDEVERYONE'S LIFE ALL OF THE TIME.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ACONSERVATIVE.
YOU'RE A LIBERAL.
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE DIFFERENTPOLITICAL OPINIONS AND YET
YOU'RE FRIENDS, BUT AT THE SAMETIME, YOU HAVE DIFFERENT
POLITICAL OPINIONS AND ARE STILLFRIENDS.
THAT'S UNNATURAL IN AMERICATHESE DAYS.
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE WHO LOVESCOFFEE TOLERATING SOMEONE WHO
DRINKS TEA.
WHERE IS YOUR MIDDLE GROUND?
>> WE'RE TRYING TO START A TRENDTHAT WOULD REQUIRE FOR INVOLVED
PEOPLE ACTUALLY LISTENING TOSOMEBODY WHO HAS A DIFFERENT
OPINION, ESPECIALLY OVER FINEWINE.
>> Stephen: OH, NOT IN ADIFFERENCE OF OPINION OTHER FINE
WINE BUT DRINKING ENOUGH THATTHE DIFFERENCES DON'T MATTER.
>> YES.
>>>> Stephen: DAVE, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
TED, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DAVID BOIES AND THEODORE OLSON,"REDEEMING THE DREAM."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
