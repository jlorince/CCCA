( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
"REPORT"!
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
A VERY SPECIAL WELCOME TO THE
SEVENTH LEVEL MAGIC USERS OUT
THERE.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, I WILL GET RIGHT TO THE
BIG NEWS.
HERMAN CAIN IS UNDER ATTACK.
THIS IS A DARK, DARK DAY FOR
AMERICA.
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE HE'S, YOU KNOW...
(LAUGHTER)
AMERICAN.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, WHEN YOU'RE TOP IN
THE POLLS, THE MEDIA DIGS
THROUGH YOUR PAST.
IT'S NOT FUN BUT IT BEATS BEING
JOHN HUNTSMAN.
NO ONE'S EVEN DIGGING THROUGH
HIS PRESENT.
AND NOW COMES TRUMPED-UP CHARGES
THAT WHEN CAIN WAS HEAD OF THE
NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION
HE HARASSED FEMALE EMPLOYEES
WITH GESTURES THAT WERE NOT
OVERTLY SEXUAL BUT MADE THE
WOMEN UNCOMFORTABLE.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
NATURALLY I ASSUME THE GESTURE
WAS SOMETHING INNOCUOUS LIKE...
(LAUGHTER)
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
INCIDENTALLY, THAT'S ALSO A
GREAT WAY TO GET OUT OF JUROR
DUTY.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, LAST NIGHT HERMAN CAIN
WENT ON GRETA VAN SUSTEREN TO
HERMAN VAN EXPLAIN HIPLTSZ.
JIM?
>> I MADE A GESTURE SAYING OH...
I WAS STANDING CLOSE TO HER AND
I MADE A GESTURE.
YOU ARE THE SAME HEIGHT AS MY
WIFE.
AND BROUGHT MY HAND-- DIDN'T
TOUCH HER-- UP TO MY CHIN AND
SAID "YOU'RE THE SAME HEIGHT AS
MY WIFE BECAUSE MY WIFE COMES UP
TO MY CHIN."
>> Stephen: WOMEN.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY ALWAYS TAKE COMMENTS ABOUT
THEIR HEIGHT AS SOMETHING
SEXUAL.
LIKE, HEY, LET'S STAND BACK TO
BACK TO SEE WHO'S TALLER--
EXCEPT I'LL BE FACING YOU
WITHOUT ANY PANTS ON.
(LAUGHTER)
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO'S REALLY TO
BLAME FOR THIS CONTROVERSY.
>> SOME ANONYMOUS LADIES HAVE
SPURRED UP A CONTROVERSY WITH
RESPECT TO THE FALSE CLAIM OF
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
>> YES!
THESE LADIES ARE THE REAL
HARASSERS.
HIDING BEHIND THEIR ANONYMITY
JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE PAID A
SETTLEMENT TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS
IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR SILENCE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AND IF YOU DON'T TALK, CLEARLY
YOU'RE LYING.
BUT CAIN IS ALLOWED TO SPEAK,
THEREFORE HE IS TELLING THE
TRUTH.
IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF HE
SAID/SHE'S LEGALLY PROHIBITED
FROM SAYING.
(LAUGHTER)
STILL NOT CONVINCED?
THEN HERMAN CAIN HAS A QUESTION
FOR YOU!
>> (INAUDIBLE) OPEN AND SHUT.
WHO HASN'T BEEN ACCUSED OF
SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
OKAY, SHOW OF HANDS.
SHOW OF HANDS.
LADIES, RAISE BOTH HANDS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW SHAKE IT UP.
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, LADI
