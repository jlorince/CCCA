WE LOVE YOU, CONGRESS.
OF COURSE, AMERICA HAS A PROUDHISTORY OF PATRIOTS STANDING UP
AGAINST GOVERNMENT OVERREACH.
WHERE WOULD WE BE IF OURFOUNDING FATHERS HADN'T
RISEN UP AGAINST THE TYRANNY OFKING GEORGE?
TECHNICALLY, WE'D STILL BE RIGHTHERE.
THAT'S HOW GEOGRAPHY WORKS.
BUT WE'D ALL BE WEARING ABSURDWIGS INSTEAD OF JUST DONALD
TRUMP.
TONIGHT, FOLKS, I AM PROUD TOPROFILE THE LATEST GROUP OF
HEROS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO GIVEBIG GOVERNMENT AN

>> A POWERFUL VISION FOR ABETTER TOMORROW.
WE CONFRONTED JACKBOOTED CITYCOUNCILOR RANDY FILIAULT FOR A
RESPONSE.
>> FREE KEENE CLAIMS THEY'REFREEING KEENE FROM SOMETHING.
MOST OF US THAT HAVE LIVED HEREALL OF OUR LIVES REALLY HAVEN'T
FIGURED THAT PART OUT YET.

AND I REALLY DON'T SEE HOWISSUING PARKING TICKETS MEETS
ANY OF THOSE GOALS.
>> SO FREE KEENE SPRANG INTOACTION BY RUNNING AHEAD OF METER
MAIDS AND PUTTING COINS IN THEMETERS BEFORE THEY EXPIRE.
THEY CALL IT "ROBIN HOODING."
THEY'VE BEEN FILMING THEMSELVESDOING IT FOR YEARS.
AND THEY HAVE POSTED HUNDREDS OFCLIPS ON THE WEB, SOME OF WHICH
HAVE GOTTEN MULTIPLE VIEWS.
>> I GUESS I'M THE ROBINHOOD. I FEEL LIKE I'M A SUPER
HERO. I'M OUT THERE DOING GOODFOR THE COMMUNITY.
>> WHICH HAS THE TYRANNICAL CITYGOVERNMENT SHAKING IN THEIR
BOOTS.
>> PROBABLY THE MOSTCONTROVERSIAL ISSUE WASN'T THEM
PLUGGING A METER.
QUITE HONESTLY, NONE OF USCARED.
WHAT WE CARED ABOUT WAS THEYWERE FOLLOWING AROUND THE METER
ATTENDANT AND HARASSING THEM.
