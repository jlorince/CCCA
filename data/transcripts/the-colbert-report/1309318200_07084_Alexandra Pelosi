>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT MADE A
DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE MAKING OF
A U.S. CITIZEN.
I KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT.
I LEARNED IT IN HEALTH CLASS.
PLEASE WELCOME ALEXANDRA PELOSI.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE AN
EMMY-WINNING FILM MAKER.
YOU MADE JOURNEYS WITH GEORGE,
DIARIES OF A POLITICAL TOURIST,
RIGHT AMERICA.
FEELING WRONG.
YOUR NEW DOCUMENTARY STARTING
WHEN?
>> FOURTH OF JULY, OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: CITIZEN U.S.A.
YOU DOCUMENTED PEOPLE ALL OVER
THE UNITED STATES BEING SWORN IN
TO BECOME U.S. CITIZENS.
>> DID YOU READ IT?
>> Stephen: NO.
>> YES, I WENT TO ALL 50 STATES
TO MEET NEW AMERICAN CITIZENS TO
FIND OUT WHY THEY WANTED TO
BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS.
>> Stephen: TO STEAL OUR JOBS.
[LAUGHTER]
RIGHT?
>> THEY ACTUALLY BRING JOBS,
TOO.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH Ph.DS.
NOT JUST PEOPLE SWIMMING THE
RIVER.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH Ph.D'S.
A MAN FROM GOOGLE HE WASN'T BORN
HERE.
>> Stephen: HE WASN'T.
>> NO THEY DON'T ALL STEAL OUR
JOBS.
>> Stephen: WHICH ONES DO YOU
HATE?
>> I LIKE THE DUTCH BECAUSE MY
HUSBAND IS DUTCH.
HE INSPIRED THE ROAD TRIP.
>> Stephen: HE WAS NOT AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN AND BECAME AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN.
>> WE HAD KIDS AND HE FELT LIKE
HE HAD TO BELONG BECAUSE THEY
CAN TAKE YOUR GREEN CARD AWAY.
HE THOUGHT AFTER WE HAD KIDS HE
HAD TO PROTECT THE KIDS TO MAKE
SURE THEY HAD THE SAME RIGHTS.
I LIKE THE DUTCH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHEN HE BECAME AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN, DID HE HAVE TO
STOP SMOKING POT?
>> NO, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: DUTCH PEOPLE ARE
ALWAYS HIGH.
IT'S LEGAL THERE.
>> IT'S LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA AND
WE'RE BYCOASTAL SO IT WORKS.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW.
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT
ADVERTISEMENT FOR YOUR MOM.
WILL YOU PLEASE ASK YOUR MOM TO
TAKE HER BOOT OFF THE NECK OFF
THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SO
THEY CAN TALK TO ME ON MY
SERIES?
>> I COULD BE BALL.
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES YOUR
SUPERPAC HAVE.
>> Stephen: DOES SHE WATCH THE
SHOW?
>> SHE'S WATCHING RIGHT NOW.
ARE YOU SCARED?
DOES THAT MAKE YOU SCARED?
>> Stephen: NANCY, CALL OFF
THE DOGS!
ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S GET BACK TO THIS.
WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, CAN YOU SEE IT HAPPEN?
BECAUSE SECONDS BEFORE THEY WERE
A CITIZEN, THEY WERE COMPLETELY
UNTRUSTWORTHY, FREE LOADERS WHO
WERE HERE TO TAKE THE JOBS
AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO DO.
THAT SECOND -- THAT SECOND THEY
BECOME AN AMERICAN, THEY ARE THE
GREATEST BRAVEST PEOPLE ON
EARTH.
DO YOU SEE IT HAPPEN?
DO YOU SEE THAT MOMENT?
>> YOU CAN SEE IT BECAUSE THEY
PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE -- THEY'LL GO
TO WAR.
THEY RENOUNCE THE CITIZENSHIP OF
THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND THEY
PLEDGE THAT THEY'LL SERVE THE
COUNTRY.
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO ONE, HAVE
YOU?
>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO.
I WANTED TO GO TO ONE.
YOU AND I PLANNED I WAS GOING TO
SWEAR IN 15 DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND
MAKE THEM CITIZENS.
HONEST TO GOD PART OF FOURTH OF
JULY CELEBRATION.
>> BECAUSE YOU LOVE AMERICA.
>> Stephen: I AM AMERICA DID.
>> BUT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T
LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE
THEM.
>> Stephen: HOMELAND SECURITY
SAID IT WAS OKAY.
WHO SHOT US DOWN?
>> THE WHITE HOUSE.
>>.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
BLAME IT ON NANCY PELOSI.
THERE'S ONE THING WE CAN'T BLAME
ON HER.
>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO BARACK
OBAMA SAID I CAN'T DO IT.
IN BETWEEN WORKING ON THE DEBT
CEILING SOMEONE CAME CHARGING TO
THE OVAL OFFICE AND HE HIT THE
RED BUTTON TO STOP ME.
THERE'S A TEST?
>> YOU HAVE TO BE A PERSON OF
GOOD MORAL CHARACTER.
HAVE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN A MEMBER OF COMMUNIST PARTY
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A HAD A BY
THE YOU'LL DRUNKARD?
>> Stephen: GO ON.
HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU SEE TAKE
THE TASTE?
>> MANY.
I WENT TO ALL 50 STATES.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LESS
LOOK A DOCUMENTARY AND MORE LIKE
A DARE.
IS IT DIFFERENT FROM STATE TO
STATE HOW THEY SWEAR PEOPLE IN?
>> I WANTED TO FIND OUT.
I WANT TO ALL 50 STATES TO FIND
OUT WHY PEOPLE STILL COME TO
AMERICA.
>> Stephen: IS THE CEREMONY
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT STATES?
>> YES.
>>.
>> Stephen:?
ARIZONA THEY MAKE YOU A CITIZEN
AND THEN ASK FOR YOUR PAPERS?
>>
[LAUGHTER]
>> IT'S MORE ABOUT THE
ENTERTAINMENT.
IN SOME STATES THEY HAVE BETTER
ENTERTAINMENT.
>> Stephen: THEY HAVE BETTER
ENTERTAINMENT?
>> YES.
AT THE CIRCUS IN ONE STATE AND A
BALLPARK.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, THE
WHITE HOUSE WAS WORRIED I
WOULDN'T GIVE THIS THE DIGGITY
REQUIRED AND THEY DO IT AT A
CIRCUS?
>> IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THEY DID
IT IN A CIRCUS.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU SAID
AFTERWARDS THEY GO CELEBRATE.
YOU'VE BEEN TO ONE PARTICULAR
RESTAURANT MORE THAN ANY OTHER
BECAUSE AFTER PEOPLE GET SWOSH
SWORN IN THEY GO TO THE SAME
RESTAURANT.
>> OLIVE GARDEN.
I WENT TO OLIVE GARDEN IN ALL 50
STATES EXCEPT ALASKA.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT
THERE.
>> Stephen: THEY GET SWORN IN
AND GO TO THE OLIVE GUARD TON
TEST THEIR -- GARDEN TO TEST
THEIR RESOLVE TO STAY.
ALEXANDRA PELOSI, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
