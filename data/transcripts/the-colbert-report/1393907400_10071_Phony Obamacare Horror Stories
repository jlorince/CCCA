NATION, CHECK YOUR CALENDARS,WE'RE ONLY 250 DAYS AWAY
FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTIONSWHICH ARE GOING BE A
REFERENDUM ON THE AFFORDABLECARE ACT ALSO KNOWN AS
OBAMACARE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREATFOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE
WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT THELIVES THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT HAS RUINED.
LIKE THE STORY OF REPUBLICANDEN MOTHER KATHY McMORRIS
ROGERS TOLD DURING HERRESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE
UNION.
>> NOT LONG AGO I GOT ALETTER FROM BETTE IN SPOKANE
WHO HAD HOPED THE PRESIDENT'SHEALTH CARE LAW WOULD SAVE
HER MONEY.
BUT FOUND OUT INSTEAD HERPREMIUMS WERE GOING UP
NEARLY $700 A MONTH.
>> Stephen: $700 A MONTH.
AT THAT RATE BETTE INSPOKANE IS NEVER GOING TO BE
ABLE TO AFFORD THAT LASTNAME TRANSPLANT.
AND WHEN THE SPOKANESPOKESMAN REVIEW TRACKED
BETTE DOWN, THE PAPERREVEALED THAT BETTE REFUSED
TO LOOK FOR A LESS EXPENSIVEOPTION BECAUSE, QUOTE, I
WOULDN'T GO ON THE OBAMA WEBSITE AT ALL.
THERE'S ANOTHER FLAW OF THEOBAMACARE WEB SITE.
YOU HAVE TO GO ON IT TO USEIT.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU.
(APPLAUSE)NOW FOLKS, POOR BETTE IS NOT
ALONE.
IN FACT SO, MANY OBAMACAREHORROR STORIES HAVE BEEN
DEBUNKED AT THIS POINT THATTHE LOS ANGELES TIMES
SPECULATED THAT MAYBE THEREARE NO GENUINE OBAMACARE
HORROR STORIES.
YEAH, OR MAYBE THERE WEREUNTIL THE DEATH PANELS GOT
THEM.
NOW LUCKILY, AMERICANS FORPROSPERITY HAS A NEW
ANTI-OBAMACARE AD WITHHEART-WRENCHING PERSONAL
STORIES.
>> DEAR MRS. KELLY, YOURFAMILY PLAN IS NO LONGER
AVAILABLE UNDER THEAFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
>> DEAR MISS DAVIS, WE CANNO LONGER OFFER YOU THE SAME
POLICY.
THE DOCTOR IS NO LONGER INTHE NETWORK DUE TO THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
>> DUE TO THE AFFORDABLECARE ACT YOUR MONTLY PREMIUM
HAS INCREASED.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I WISHTHESE STORIES WEREN'T TRUE.
AND MSNBC IS TRYING TO GRANTMY WISH.
>> THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TOSHOW YOU, REAL IMAGES OF
REAL PEOPLE LOSING THEIRINSURANCE.
JUST ONE PROBLEM.
ALL THESE PEOPLE YOU SEE INTHE ADS, ARE PAID ACTORS.
THEY'RE JUST PRETENDING TOBE VICTIMS.
>> Stephen: AND AL SHARPTONSHOULD KNOW BECAUSE HE'S
JUST PRETENDING TO BE AJOURNALIST.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: OKAY.
OKAY.
SO THOSE ARE ACTORS ANDTHOSE LETTERS THEY'RE
READING ARE WORKS OFFICTION.
BUT AS AN AMERICAN FORPROSPERITY SPOKESMAN TOLD
ABC NEWS, IN CONTRAST TO THESTORY OF A REAL VOTER, THIS
AD IS MEANT TO BEREPRESENTATIVE OF AMERICANS
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE AD ISN'T BASED ONANYONE'S REAL STORY.
