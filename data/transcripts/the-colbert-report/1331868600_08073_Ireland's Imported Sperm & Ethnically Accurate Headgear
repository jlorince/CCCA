( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION-- CHECK YOUR CALENDARS,
EVERYBODY.
THIS SATURDAY IS ST. PATRICK'S
DAY, AND TO GET IN THE SPIRIT, I
HAVE FILLED THE STUDIO WITH
POISONOUS SNAKES SO I CAN DRIVE
THEM OUT LIKE ST. PATRICK.
DON'T WORRY, AUDIENCE-- THEY
NEVER COME OUT UNLESS THERE'S A
LOUD NOISE LIKE CHEERING OR
CLAPPING OR CHANTING MY NAME.
UNFORTUNATELY, BACK IN ME
IRELAND, NOT EVERYTHING IS SO
FESTIVE.
IT SEEMS THAT THE HIGH EXCHANGE
RATE BETWEEN THE EURO AND THE
DANISH KRONE IS CAUSING SKY-HIGH
PRICES FOR ONE OF DENMARK'S HOT
EXPORTS TO IRELAND, DANISH
SPERM.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU SEE, THE IRISH IMPORT ALL
THEIR SPERM FROM DENMARK, RATHER
THAN PRODUCE THEIR OWN BECAUSE
OF THEIR LACK OF REGULATION FOR
DONATING SPERM AND BECAUSE IN
IRELAND, NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO
MOVE THEIR HANDS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WELL I AM NOT--
( APPLAUSE )
I AM NOT-- I AM NOT GOING TO SIT
HERE WHILE THE ISLE NEEDS ME.
THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO
INTRODUCE MY NEW BRAND FOR MAN'S
SEED FOR THE IRELAND MARKET.
STEPHEN COLBERT FORMULA FOUR
O'ONE, FRESH FROM MY BARNEY
STONE.
TIPO THE MORNING TO YOU, THE
TIP, OF COURSE, THE MOST
SENSITIVE PART.
I'M GLAD TO HELP OUT MY FELLOW
IRISH AND THIS WEEKEND I WILL BE
TEARING IT UP AT THE LOCAL
TRADITIONAL IRISH PUNDIT
GATHERING AT O'HANRAHAN'S.
I PLAY THE BOREN, HANNITY PLAYED
TIN WHISTLE, OH, REILLY STEP
DANCES, AND CHRIS MATTHEWS IS ON
THE POTATO.
I ALWAYS WRESTLE WITH HOW TO
HONOR THE OLD SOD ON ST.
PATRICK'S DAY, BUT THIS YEAR IT
WILL BE EASY THANKS TO A SPECIAL
PACKAGE I RECEIVED FROM AN
ACTUAL IRISH WHISKEY COMPANY WHO
SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS BECAUSE
THERE WAS NO CASH IN THE BAG.
NO FREE RIDES.
THEY ALSO INCLUDED THIS
AUTHENTIC IRISH CULTURAL
GARMENT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
FINALLY, FINALLY, SOMEONE
TREATING THE IRISH WITH DIGNITY.
( LAUGHTER )
TOO OFTEN THESE DAYS WE'RE
STEREOTYPED AS EX-CIA OPERATIVES
ON THE HUNT FOR THEIR KIDNAPPED
DAUGHTERS OR FIGHTERS OF GRAY
WOLVES OR MENTORS TO THE BATMAN.
BUT AT LEAST, AROUND IRISH
PRODUCT IS RESPECTFULLY
REPRESENTING MY PEOPLE AS
DRUNKEN AMISH.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ).
IN FACT, I WAS SO INSPIRED THEY
PREPARED A WHOLE LINE OF
ETHNICALLY ACCURATE HEADGEAR FOR
THE HOLIDAYS.
IF THE GOOD PEOPLE AT
MANISCHEWITZ ARE WATCHING RIGHT
NOW, MIGHT I RECOMMEND THIS WEEK
SENDING OUT THIS PASSOVER PARTY
HAT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( LAUGHTER )
WHY-- WHY IS THIS HAT DIFFERENT
FROM ALL OTHER HATS?
BECAUSE IT IS IN NO WAY
OFFENSIVE.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, LET'S SEE.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I AM GOING TO INDULGE IN SOME OF
MY TRADITIONAL FOODS FROM MY
HOMELAND.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERING )
BOWL OF LUCKY CHARMS, AND OF
COURSE SOME FRESH CUT IRISH
SPRING.
( LAUGHTER )
OH, THE SPIRITS OF THE SEASON.
AND THEN I'M GOING TO STAB AN
ENGLISHMAN IN THE NECK.
