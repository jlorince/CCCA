EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS BOTH A
RHODES SCHOLAR AND A NAVY SEESM
YEAH, BUT HOW MANY DAYTIME EMMYS
HAS HE BEEN NOMINATED FOR.
PLEASE WELCOME ERIC GREITENS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BOOM!
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.
ALL RIGHT, EVEN THAT HANDSHAKE
WAS INTIMIDATING.
[LAUGHTER]
SIR, YOU ARE AS, AS I SAID
RHODES SCHOLAR AND A NAVY SEAL.
WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE
DEPLOYED.
>?]I 2007.> Stephen: IF YOU HAD BEEN
DEPLOYED INTO THE COMPOUND TO
TAKE OUT BIN LADEN, COULD YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO
ASSUME YOU WERE ONE OF THE GUYS.
[LAUGHTER]
YOUR BOOK IS CALLED THE HEART
AND THE FIFTH, THE EDUCATION OF
THE HUMANITARIAN, THE MAKING OF
A NAVY SEAL.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TITLE "THE
HEART AND THE FIST."
IS THAT HOW YOU TAKE A MAN DOWN
BY PUNCH HIM IN THE HEART WITH
YOUR FIST?
>> KIT WORK EFFECTIVELY.
>> Stephen: IF A TERRORIST
CAME IN TO THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW
HOW MANY OBJECTS COULD YOU USE
TO SUBDUE HIM?
>> WE HAVE THE CARD, THE BOOK
AND THE CUP HERE.
WE USE WHATEVER WE CAN.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU USE ME
TO SUBDUE HIM?
>> I THINK THAT'S THE MOST
EFFECTIVE WEAPON.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE NOT
ALWAYS THE WARRIOR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU STARTED OFF AS
A HUMANITARIAN WORKER.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
>> I WAS WORKING WITH KID WHO'S
LOST LIMBS IN LEFT HAND MINE AND
THOSE WHOaIN RWANDAN AND I DID WORK WITH
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WORKING
TO HELP KIDS IN SOME OF THE MOST
DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES
OVERSEAS.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO TO
SEEING THE RAVAGES OF WAR TO
BEING A WARRIOR?
>> THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS
WORKING IN BOSNIA, LIVING IN A
REFUGEE CAMP WORKING WITH KIDS.
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A MAN WHO
TOLD ME ABOUT THE TERRIBLE
THINGS DONE TO HIS FAMILY.
HORRIBLE THINGS DONE TO HIS
WIFE, HIS BROTHERS.
HE SAID TO ME, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISUNDERSTAND ME.
HE SAID I APPRECIATE THE SHELTER
HERE TR MY FAMILY, I APPRECIATE
THE FOOD BUT IF YOU REALLY CARED
ABOUT US, YOU WOULD BE WILLING
TO PROTECT US.
I RECOGNIZED THEN THAT SOMETIMES
IT TAKES THE HEART AND 9 FIST.
YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE
WITH COMPASSION BUT JUST LIKE
ANYTHING WE LOVE YOU HAVE TO BE
WILLING TO PROTECT PEOPLE, USE
YOUR STRENGTH TO A GOOD PURPOSE.
>> Stephen: HERE IS ONE OF THE
ISSUES WITH THE NAVY SEALS.
WE'LL TAKE THE GUYS WHO TOOK OUT
BIN LADEN.
I CAN'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
HOW THEN CAN I "BIOGRAPHY" THEM
A -- CAN I BUY THEM A BEER?
HOW DO I IDENTIFY THEM AT A BAR?
SHOULD I THROW A PUNCH AT EVERY
PERSON AND THE GUY WHO --
[LAUGHTER]
>> PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BEING THE
TIP OF SPEAR.
>> Stephen: THAT IS THE MOST
SENSITIVE PART OF THE SPEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YES.
>> Stephen: GO AHEAD.
>> I THINK THEY WOULD ALSO TELL
YOU THAT IN ORDER FOR THEM TO DO
THAT WORK EFFECTIVELY THERE'S A
TRAIN OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEM
SUPPORTING THEM IN THE U.S.
MILITARY, IN COMMUNITIES AROUND
THE COUNTRY.
IF YOU WANT TO THANK THEM WE
SHOULD THANK THEM.
YOU CAN THANK EVER PERSON WHO
HAS SERVED SINCE SEPTEMBER 11,
2001 BECAUSE THIS WAS THEIR
VICTORY AS WELL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU BECAME A NAVY SEAL, WERE YOU
ALARMED BY WHAT YOU HAD TO GO
THROUGH TO BECOME ONE?
WHAT IS THE HARDEST THING YOU
HAVE TO DO IT'S LEDGE TKPWEPBD
TEAR DAIRY HOW DIFFICULT
TUESDAY.
>> YOU HAVE TO SWIM THE 50
METERS UNDER WATER, LATER THEY
ASK YOU TO SWIM DOWN 50 FEET AND
TIE A KNOT.
ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS IS
DROWN PROOFING.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE A
HANDY SKILL.
>> THEY TIE YOUR FEET TOGETHER
AND YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
WITH YOUR FEET TIED TOGETHER AND
YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK YOU
HAVE TO JUMP IN THE POOL.
>> Steve: THE JUMP IS THE EASY
PART.
>> YES.
THEN YOU HAVE TO SWIM 50 METERS.
YOU COME BACK IN THE NINE FOOT
SECTION OF THE POOL.
THE NEXT THING THEY ASK YOU TO
DO, WHEN THEY TOLD ME I LOVED
OUT LOUD THEY SAID WE'RE GOING
TO THROW YOUR FACE MASK INTO THE
WATER, IT'S GOING TO SINK DOWN
TO THE NINE FOOT PART AND YOU'LL
GO DOWN WITH YOUR FEET AND HANDS
TIDE, GRAB THE MASK WITH YOUR
TEETH AND DO THAT FIVE MORE
TIMES.
>> Stephen: I'M GUESSING NOT
EVERYONE MAKES IT.
>> IT'S CONSIDERED THE HARDEST
MILITARY TRAINING IN THE WORLD.
IN OUR CLASS WE STARTED WITH 220
PEOPLE AND WE GRADUATED WITH 21.
>> Stephen: DO YOU EVER TRASH
TALK THE OTHER SERVICES?
COME ON!
SPECIAL FORCES?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: TOTAL POSERS.
SAY IT.
IT WON'T COME BACK TO BITE YOU
IN THE ASS.
>> THEY ARE SOLID, THE SPECIAL
FORCES GUYS.
WE WORK WITH THEM, MARINES, ARMY÷ú
RANGERS, MARINE FORCE RECON.
>> Stephen: ALL OF THEM BUT
THEY ARE NOT NAVY SEALS.
THANK YOU
