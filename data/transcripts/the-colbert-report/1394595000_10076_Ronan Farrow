DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE  JUSTWAKING UP FROM NOT GETTING TO

AUDIENCE, WHICH HAS-- CAN MY GENERATION --

STATE DEPARTMENT AND NOW RUN ATV SHOW?
BUT THAT'S THE TARGET DEMO.

THE RHODES SCHOLARS.

THANKS TO OBAMACARE.
>> TRUE, TRUE.
RIGHT, ISN'T THAT A WONDERFULTHING?
WHAT TO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISHWITH THAT SHOW THAT YOU COULDN'T
ACCOMPLISH WITH NEW MEDIA.
ISN'T THE OLD MEDIA DEADACCORDING TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES I WASREFERRING TO EARLIER IS NOT JUST
ABOUT REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE MYAGE.
IT'S ABOUT BRIDGING THAT DIVIDE.
AND I FOUND AUDIENCE MEMBERS OLDAND YOUNG DON'T WANT TO BE
LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
IT'S FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES,GRANDMOTHERS SAYING, "AND I LEFT
CHURCH COLLECTION EARLY TO VOTEAND BE A PART OF YOUR SHOW AND
TALK ABOUT SYRIA AND BLANK OUTMY SOCIAL MEDIA AVATAR TO TRY TO
MAKE A STATEMENT ON THE DEATH TOLL IN SYRIA.
>> PEOPLE ARE GETTING INVOLVEDIN WHICH I THINK THEY DON'T
OFTEN HAVE A CHANCE TO DO INCABLE NEWS.
>> Stephen:  WHAT TRAP DO YOUNOT WANT TO FALL INTO THAT YOU
SEE THE REST OF CABLE NEWS FALLINTO?
>> I THINK IT'S A LOT OFRHETORIC AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER.
>> Stephen:  THE LOUDER YOUARE, THE RIGHTER YOU ARE.
DO YOU SHOUT AT YOUR GUESTS?
>> I STUDIED YOU FOR THESHOUTING TECHNIQUE.
YOU DO IT VERY WELL.
BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GIVINGPEOPLE REALLY USEFUL, TANGIBLE
INFORMATION SO WHEN THEY WALKAWAY FROM A STORY THEY HAVE
SOMETHING THEY CAN USE TO GUIDETHEM. MAKE IT USEFUL IS MY
MANTRA.
ON YOUR TELEVISION NETWORK,MSNBC, ARE YOU LEGALLY ALLOWED
TO DO A SHOW WITHOUT REFERRINGTO CHRIS CHRISTIE RIGHT NOW?
I WOULD SAY, LOOK, I AS A VIEWERDO RESPECT THE BODY OF
REPORTING.
I HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE NEAR THEFOR,  IS THERE
PARTISANSHIP GOING ON HERE?
I THINK THE REPORTING IS HELDUP.
IT'S A STORY YOU CAN DRAW ON.
WHERE DO YOU FALL ON THEIDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM.
ARE YOU A RAGING LIBERAL ORFURTHER LEFT THAN THAT?
>> IT'S NOT RIGHT OR LEFT.
AND HONESTLY THAT COMES FROMBEING SERVED IN GOVERNMENT AND
FED UP WITH HOW BROKEN THESYSTEM IS AND COMING OUT WITH AN
ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT BENT.
IT'S BROKEN AND SHINING A LIGHTFROM THE OUTSIDE SEEMS LIKE A
GOOD IDEA.
>> Stephen:  YOU ASK YOURAUDIENCE
TO TWEET A CALL TO ACTION.
>> SOMETIMES NOT JUST TWITTER.
SOMETIMES IT'S A CALL TO ASENATOR.
OR LIKE MAKING ASTATEMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
THE IDEAL IS WE GIVE YOU A TOOLSET AND A MENU OF THINGS YOU
ACTUALLY DO.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU THINKYOUNG PEOPLE-- AND I'M GOING TO
SAY-- SPEAK FOR ALL YOUNGPEOPLE.
DON'T YOU THINK IF THERE'SREALLY GOING TO BE A REVOLUTION
IN THIS COUNTRY WE CAN'TACTUALLY BE TWEETING AND BLOGS
AND PHONING.
DON'T PEOPLE HAVE TO GET TO THESTREETS AND THROW BRICKS AT
WINDOWS.
>> IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ASHATTERING.
THE TEA PARTY CAME CLOSE, BUTTHEY DIDN'T GET VIOLENT AS MUCH
AS THEY WERE ACCUSED OF IT.
DON'T YOU THINK THERE HAS TO BESOME KIND OF VIOLENT REVOLUTION
IN AMERICA FOR THINGS TO GETBETTER.
ISN'T IT NICE TALKING ABOUT-->> YOU MAKE A VERY GOOD POINT.
I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ARABSPRING POLICY.
WE HAD A YOUTH REVOLUTION THINKTANK.
I'M NOT SAYING EVERYTHING WE DIDWORKED.
WE CREATED IT BECAUSE THERE WASA STORY GOING AROUND AS SOCIAL
MEDIA.
SOMETIMES TWITTER AND FACEBOOKOBSCURE THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES
WE BACK THE BAD GUYS ANDSOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
THAT, AND THERE'S A FEELING OFBEING OUT OF TOUCH ON THEIR
PARENTS UPON YOU ARE ABSOLUTELYRIGHT, THAT NO AMOUNT OR
TWEETING WILL SUPPLANT REALACTION IN THE REAL WORLD OR
COVER UP POLICY THAT CATERS TO AGENERATION.
I THINK THESE ARE ALL TOOLS TOCOMMUNICATE BUT THEY'RE NOT AN
REPLACEMENT.
>> Stephen:  YOU FINISHED HIGHSCHOOL AT 11?
YOU FINISHED COLLEGE AT 15.
YOU WENT OFF TO LAW SCHOOL AT16, WHEN IS YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS.
