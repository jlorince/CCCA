PROBLEM?
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A NICE PLACE TOGO AND SPEND AN AFTERNOON
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUTGOING AND GETTING DRUNK AND
OCCASIONALLY A BASEBALL GAMEHAPPENS THERE.
IT'S BEEN SINCE 1908 SINCE THEYWON THE WORLD SERIES.
YOU DON'T GO THERE TO WATCHBASEBALL.

>> Stephen: WAS TOLSTOY AWHITE SOX FAN?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND(LAUGHTER)

THEY HAD A VENDOR THERE WHOTRIED TO CHEAT THE FANS.
HIS NAME WAS JACK RUBINSTEIN.
MOVED TO DALLAS, CHANGED HISNAME TO JACK RUBY AND SHOT LEE
