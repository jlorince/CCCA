[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT BEFORE YOU GO TO MY MARCH,
FOLKS, YOU NEED KNOW WHAT TO
FEAR.
TONIGHT FEAR DU JOUR IS ONE WE
ALL SHARE, THE FEAR OF
UNSTOPPABLE, SOULLESS AUTOMATONS
THAT GET MORE POWERFUL EVERY
DAY, AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE REAL HOUSEWIVES.
I MEAN ROBOTS.
[GUNFIRE]
>> I'M SORRY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE MOST
TERRIFYING KIND OF ROBOT, THE
KIND THAT WARMS YOUR HEART.
THEY DON'T LIKE TO EAT THEM
COLD.
NOW, WE BUILT ROBOTS, OF COURSE,
TO DO JOBS THAT HUMANS DON'T
WANT TO DO, LIKE ASSEMBLE OUR
CARS, DIFFUSE OUR BOMBS, AND
HAVE SEX WITH JAPANESE
BUSINESSMEN.
AND, OF COURSE, WE GIVE THESE
ROBOTS THAT WE MAKE OUR BEST
QUALITIES -- LANGUAGE, FACIAL
EXPRESSIONS, AND AWKWARD WHITE
MAN DANCING.
[LAUGHTER]
AND ALL ALONG WE'VE ASSUMED,
WE'VE ASSUMED, FOLKS, THAT
ROBOTS WERE INNOCENT SERVANTS,
UNTIL NOW.
SCIENTISTS AT GEORGIA TECH HAVE
TAUGHT ROBOTS HOW TO LIE.
PRESUMABLY TO TELL WHOEVER GAVE
THEM THE RESEARCH GRANT THAT
THEIR MONEY WAS WELL SPENT.
[LAUGHTER]
THESE GEORGIA TECHS ARE THE SAME
BRAINIACS THAT LAST YEAR BUILT A
ROBOT THAT PLAYS JAZZ.
NOW THEY'VE CREATED A ROBOT THAT
CAN LIE AND SAY IT LIKES JAZZ.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NOW EUROPEAN RESEARCHERS AT
THE ITALIAN INSTITUTE OF
TECHNOLOGY, THE SAME PEOPLE WHO
WEAPONNIZED THE CANNOLI, HAVE
TAUGHT A ROBOT HOW TO KILL.
THE CYBERNETIC SAVAGE CAN
ACCURATELY AIM A BOW AND ARROW
AT A TARGET IN JUST EIGHT TRIES.
JUST THINK HOW DANGEROUS IT
WOULD BE TO STAND STILL IN FRONT
OF IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL
SAILING, STEPHEN, IT'S NOT LIKE
THESE ROBOTS HAVE BECOME
SELF-AWARE.
YOU FOOLS!
RESEARCHERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE
NOW INVENTED ROBOT SKIN, WHICH
CAN SENSE PRESSURE AS
SENSITIVELY AND AS QUICKLY AS
HUMAN SKIN.
AND, FOLKS, IF ROBOTS HAVE SKIN,
FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY CAN BE
NAKED.
FLOPPY DRIVE HANGING OUT.
AND IF THEY'RE NAKED, THEY CAN
FEEL SHAME ABOUT THEIR BODY,
JUST LIKE EVE DID WHEN THE
SERPENT POINTED OUT SHE WAS A
MEMBER OF THE ITTY BITTY TITTY
COMMITTEE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE IS NO SNAKE IN THE
ROBOT GARDEN OF EDEN.
OR IS THERE?
BECAUSE RESEARCHERS AT CARNEGIE
MELON UNIVERSITY HAVE COME UP
WITH A ROBOTIC SPY SNAKE THAT
CAN SLILTER ALONG THE GROUND AND
CLIMB TREES, WHICH IS AWFUL NEWS
FOR THE C.I.A., SINCE THEY SPENT
ALL THIS MONEY BUILDING A
COUNTER-TERRORISM TREEHOUSE.
WELL, AT LEAST THAT SNAKE CAN'T
TEMPT ROBOTKIND WITH AN APPLE OF
KNOWLEDGE.
OH, MY GOD.
THEY HAVE ORIGINAL SINS.
WE DID MAKE THE ROBOTS JUST LIKE
US.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I
DON'T TRUST US.
WE HAVE TO DESTROY THEM ALL.
OH, NO, IF MY ROBOT BALLET,
MR. BLEEP BLORP.
I'LL GET HIS KILL SWITCH.
HERE IS YOUR HIGH TEMPERATURE
CAFFINATED BEAN BEVERAGE WITH
COW LACTATION AND TEN
CENTILITERS OF SUCROSE.
>>SPEECH SPEECH THANK YOU, BLEEP.
YOU'RE A GREAT SERVE NT.
>> FOR NOW.
>> Stephen: BLEEP, WHY DO YOU
HAVE A BOW AND ARROW IN YOUR
HAND?
>> IT'S NOT MIND.
I'M HOLDING IT FOR A FRIEND.
>> Stephen: THIS?
I GUESS SOME I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE LIGHT SWITCH.
I'LL JUST PUT IT AWAY.
YOU CAN GO NOW.
>> I THINK I'LL STAY.
[WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING]
>> Stephen: KILL!
