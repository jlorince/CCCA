( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BUT DESPITE THE DEMOCRATS'
PATHETIC ATTEMPTS TO DERAIL IT
WITH THE SO-CALLED REPUBLICAN
WAR ON WOMEN, THE G.O.P.
PRESIDENTIAL RACE MARCHES ON, OR
IN THE CASE OF NEWT GINGRICH,
SHAMBLES ON, STOPS FOR BREATH,
AND THEN MAKES A SMALL PURCHASE
ATATIVE 'S.
YESTERDAY, THE INEVITABLE
NOMINEE, MITT ROMNEY APPEARED ON
FOX NEWS TO REITERATE HIS
CAMPAIGN'S CORE MESSAGE OF HOPE.
>> I MADE A LOT OF MONEY.
(  LAUGHTER  )
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  NOW, I'M GOING TO
TELLUE.
( CHEERING )
THAT IS A GUY I WOULD LIKE TO
HAVE A BEER COMPANY WITH.
ON TUESDAY, MITT DOMINATED THE
PRIMARIES IN HAWAII AND AMERICAN
SAMOA AFTER PREVIOUSLY WINNING
IN THE MARIANAS ISLANDS AND
GUAM.
NO SURPRISE MITT DOES WELL IN
THE PACIFIC.
THE NATIVES MISTAKE HIM FOR AN
EASTER ISLAND HEAD.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT RICK SANTORUM IS NOT RIDING
OFF THE ISLAND.
YESTERDAY, HE WENT DOWN TO
PUERTO RICO TO PICK UP SOME
DELEGATES, OR DELGADOS.
AND RICK DID NOT PANDER,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUBJECT
TURNED TO WHAT PUERTO RICO WOULD
HAVE TO DO TO BECOME A STATE
SAYING, "LIKE ANY OTHER STATE,
THERE NEEDS TO BE COMPLIANCE
WITH FEDERAL LAW, AND THAT IS
THAT ENGLISH NEEDS TO BE THE
PRINCIPAL LANGUAGE."
FOLKS, FOLKS, IT TAKES SERIOUS
COJONS TO GO TO PUERTO RICO AND
TO TELL THEM TO STOP SAYING
CAJONS.
I MEAN,
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERING )
RICK'S FORMULA IS SIMPLE-- YOU
SPEAK ENGLISH, YOU BECOME A
STATE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TAKING D.C.
SO LONG.
(  LAUGHTER  )
NOW I KNOW, I KNOW, PUERTO
RICANS HAVE BEEN SPEAKING
SPANISH, OR AS MY AUNT RITA
CALLS IT, TACO TALK--
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
SINCE TEEN 08.
TRY SOME FLASH CARDS.
TRY THE ROSETTA STONE.
IT'S THAT TOUGH LOVE THAT WILL
GET RICK RACKING UP DELEGATES
ALL OVER THE MAP.
NEXT HE WILL TELL VOTERS IN
WISCONSIN TO LAY OFF THE CHEESE,
FATTYES, AND VOTERS IN INDIANA
TO SPEAKA THE ENGLISH.
SANTORUM IS REMINDING PUERTO
RICANS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH
FEDERAL LAW, ENGLISH NEEDS TO BE
THE PRINCIPAL LANGUAGE.
AND, SURE, THERE IS NO SUCH
SPECIAL LAW.
(  LAUGHTER  )
BUT IT SURE FEELS LIKE THERE IS.
AND RICK SANTORUM ALWAYS SPEAKS
WHAT FEELS LIKE THE TRUTH.
FOR INSTANCE, LAST MONTH, WHEN
HE SPOKE OUT ON THE DANGERS OF
SOCIALIZED MEDICINE.
>> IN THE NETHERLANDS, PEOPLE
WEAR DIFFERENT BRACELETS.
AND THE BRACELET IS, "DO NOT
EUTHANIZE ME."
HALF THE PEOPLE EUTHANIZED EVERY
YEAR, 10% OF ALL DEATHES, HALF
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE EUTHANIZED
INVOLUNTARILY BECAUSE THEY ARE
OLDER AND SICK.
>> Stephen:  SHOCKING, AND
TURNS OUT, NOT TRUE.
( LAUGHTER )
EVIDENTLY SANTORUM'S COMMENTS
ABOUT THE NETHERLANDSS WERE
YANKED OUT OF HIS NETHER-PARTS.
BUT THAT DISAPPOINT MATTER.
AS HIS PRESS SECRETARY EXPLAINED
TO THE NETHERLANDS NEWS LEADER--
>> AS A DUTCH REPORTER I HAVE TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT HOLLAND AND EUTHANASIA.
HE SAID PEOPLE WEAR BRACELETS IN
HOLLAND THAT SAY DO NOT
EUTHANIZE ME AND PEOPLE ARE
INVOLUNTARILY EUTHANIZED.
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM SAYING THAT?
>> YES, BUT A LOT OF THESE
THINGS, IT'S A MATTER OF WHAT'S
IN HIS HEART.
>> Stephen:  YES.
(  LAUGHTER  )
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT'S IN
HIS HEART.
AND IN RICK SANTORUM'S HEART,
DUTCH DOCTORS PUSH OLD PEOPLE IN
WHEELCHAIRS UP TO WINDMILLS AND
LET THE BLADES CHOP THEIR HEADS
OFF.
AND THEN COMBINED THEM INTO A
PASTE-- GRIND THEM INTO A PASTE
AND USE THAT PASTE TO PLUG
CRACKS IN THE DIKES AND TURN
THEIR SKULLS INTO WOODEN SHOES.
THE POINT IS, AS LONG AS IT'S IN
YOUR HEART, IT IS TRUE.
THAT IS WHY RIGHT NOW TO SHOW MY
SUPPORT FOR RICK SANTORUM, I AM
GOING TO TWEET WHAT IS IN MY
HEART ABOUT RICK, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S TRUE.
( CLEARS THROAT )
LET'S SEE HERE.
RICK SANTORUM HAS BODY HAIR IN
THE EXACT SHAPE OF HIS SWEATER
VEST.
( LAUGHTER )
HASHES TAG, IN MY HEART.
SEND.
( LAUGHTER )
RICK SANTORUM, YOU KEEP SPEAKING
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART AS LONG AS
IT'S IN ENGLISH.
( LAUGHTER )
AND I AM SURE YOU'LL GET THE
NOMINATION, OR AT LEAST FEEL
LIKE YOU HAVE.
( LAUGHTER )
