WALTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORBEING HERE.
YOU HOLD THE ROBERT JOHNSONNIVEN CHAIR AS PROFESSOR OF
PSYCHOLOGY AT COLUMBIAUNIVERSITY.
YOU'RE AN EGG HEAD IN MORETHAN ONE WAY.
YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED TO THENATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,
THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS ANDSCIENCES WON THE CONTRIBUTION
AWARD BY THE AMERICANPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.
AND YOUR BOOK IS, "THEMARSHMALLOW TEST-- MASTERING
SELF-CONTROL."
THIS TITLE HAS SO MANY THINGS ILIKE "MYSELF, CONTROL, AND
MARSHMALLOWS."
EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE OUT THEREMARSHMALLOW TEST.
WHEN DID YOU HOLD THESE TESTS?
>> MOST OF THE WORK WAS BEGUN INTHE MIDDLE 60s, 1960s.
AND THEN IT CONTINUED ANDCONTINUED AND CONTINUED, AND
IT'S STILL ONGOING NOW.
>> Stephen:  SO WHAT'S THETEST?
>> THE TEST ACTUALLY-- YOU'VEGOT SOME-- YOU WANT-- AND I --
>> Stephen:  I'LL GO WITHMINE.
I'LL GO WITH MINE.
THESE ARE PINK.
>> THEY'RE PINK FROM PARIS.
>> Stephen:  OR PARIS.
LET'S DO THE PARIS PINK ONES.
WE HAVE THREE MASH MALOZE HERE.
HOW DOES THE TEST WORK.
>> IT WORKS LIKE THIS.
IF I'M THE CHILD -->> Stephen:  I'LL THE THE
CHILD.
>> YOU'RE THE CHILD.
TWO HERE, ONE HERE.
NOW, THERE'S ALSO A BELL OVERHERE THAT YOU CAN RING.
>> Stephen:  I RING IT OR YOURING IT?
>> YOU RING IT.
>> Stephen:  DING.
>> I COME RIGHT BACK INTO THEROOM.
RING IT AGAIN.
>> Stephen:  DING.
>> I COME BACK INTO THE ROOM.
NOW YOU CAN BELIEVE I'LL REALLYCOME BACK INTO THE ROOM.
>> Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND.
>> YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE ANDTIME YOU WANT.
OKAY?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> YOU'RE DONE.
>> Stephen:  DIWIN?
DID I WIN.
>> YOU GOT YOUR ONE.
BUT THAT'S IT.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GETTHOSE TWO.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )>> Stephen:  ANOTHER SO MY
UNDERSTANDING IS, MYUNDERSTANDING IS YOU THINK THAT
ONE WHO DOESN'T EAT THEMARSHMALLOW FIRST, YOU FOUND
WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE?
>> THE LONGER KIDS WAITED TO GETTHE TWO, THE LONGER THEY WAITED,
ON THE WHOLE, GENERALLY, THEMORE SUCCESSFUL THEIR LIVES
TURNED OUT TO BE IF THEY WERECONSISTENT IN HOW THEY CONTINUED
IN SELF-CONTROL OVER THE LIFECOURSE.
>> Stephen:  SO DELAYEDGRATIFICATION, SAYING WAIT AND
YOU'LL GET TWO, IN WHAT OTHERPLACE, OTHER THAN EATING
MARSHMALLOWS, DOES THAT COME INHANDY.
>> IT COMES IN HANDY, FOREXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE TO START
DELAYING GRATIFICATION BECAUSEYOU CAN'T EAT THE MARSHMALLOWS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A CLASSROOM,AND YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT THE TEACHER IS SAYING.
SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT OVERTHE YEARS, TO OUR SURPRISE-- I
MEAN, WE WEREN'T PREDICTING IT--THAT LENGTH OF TIME KIDS WAIT IS
RELATED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO WHATTHEIR BODY WEIGHT IS, WHAT THEIR
BODY WEIGHT INDEX IS, THEIR BODYMASS INDEX IS BY THE TIME
THEY'RE 32.
IT'S RELATED HOW WELL THEYPURSUE THEIR GOALS, HOW
EFFECTIVE THEY ARE AT WORK.
IT'S RELATED TO ALL KIND OFTHINGS, INCLUDING S.A.T. SCORES,
WHEN THEY'RE ADOLESCENT.
>> Stephen:  DO WE EVEN NEEDTHE S.A.T.s ANYMORE IF WE HAVE
THE MARSHMALLOW TESTS.
WE GET ALL THE KIDS IN THE ROOM,THE KID WHO WAITS FOR THE TWO
MARSHMALLOWS, RIGHT TO THE IVYLEAGUE.
>> THERE ARE A FEW STEPS INBETWEEN.
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THATBEING ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU DIDN'T
DO--( LAUGHTER )
IS-- IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BEVERY, VERY USEFUL FOR YOU
BECAUSE WHAT IT'S SAYING TO USIS THAT YOU ACTUALLY WERE ABLE
TO KEEP A GOAL IN MIND-- I WANTTHE TWO-- YOU WERE ABLE TO
INHIBIT INTERFERING RESPONSESLIKE SHOVING IT RIGHT IN YOUR
MOUTH.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  SO GOOD, THOUGH,THEY'RE DELICIOUS.
>> YOU KNOW, THEY'RE VERYSPECIAL.
>> Stephen:  YEAH, YEAH.
>> AND YOU'RE ABLE TO USE YOURATTENTION, WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO--
( LAUGHTER )IN A WAY THAT LETS YOU ACTUALLY
NOT GOBBLE THE MARSHMALLOW ANDKEEP ON GOING.
THAT'S A VERY FUNDAMENTAL SKILL.
IT NOW HAS A FANCY NAME.
IT'S CALLED EXECUTIVE CONTROL.
>> Stephen:  THESE ARE VERYGOOD MARSHMALLOWS.
>> THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL.
>> Stephen:  WERE THEY THISGOOD BACK IN THE 60s, BECAUSE
I KNOW MARSHMALLOWTECHNOLOGIES-- EVERY 18 MONTHS
THE STORAGE CAPACITY OF AMARSHMALLOW DOUBLES.
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED S'MORESLAW.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
DO YOU NOT WANT ONE?
>> NO, I DON'T YOU.
>> Stephen:  DON'T WANT ONE?
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE THETHINGS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WALTER, WALTERMISCHEL, THE MARSHMALLOW TEST.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
