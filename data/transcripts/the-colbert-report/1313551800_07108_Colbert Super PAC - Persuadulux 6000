REPLACES YOUR LUNG WITH A
MUFFLER.
LOOK IT UP.
THE POINT IS, FOLKS, IN POLITICS
MESSAGING IS EVERYTHING
SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM COLBERT
SUPER PAC'S TWO RECENT
COMMERCIAL BLITZ FOR RICK PERRY.
THEY COST A LOT OF MONEY, FOLKS.
AD TIME IN DES MOINES DOES NOT
COME CHEAP.
PLUS WE BLEW A TON OF CASH
HIRING ANDY SERKIS TO PLAY THE
CORN COB.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I PROMISE YOU, WE ARE GOING
TO KEEP THE ADS COMING BECAUSE
TWO WEEKS AGO I GOT ASKED WHAT
THE COLBERT SUPER PAC STANDS FOR
AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU, THE
SUPER NATION, TO TELL US WHAT WE
STAND FOR AS
colbertsuperpac.com.
SO FAR, 53,000 OF YOU HAVE
RESPONDED.
NOW, I PLAN TO READ ALL THE
SUBMISSIONS...
(LAUGHTER)
... WHICH I AM COMPLETELY
CAPABLE OF DOING BECAUSE READING
IS SOMETHING I DEFINITELY KNOW
HOW TO DO.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT DUE TO THE MASSIVE VOLUME,
WE INSTEAD USE COMPUTERS TO
CRUNCH THE DATA.
SO LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE
PERSUADE-U-LUX 6000.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME.
WELCOME TO THE PERSUADE-U-LUX.
WHERE ELOQUENT SPEECH BECOMES
GOOD AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAD MY STAFF GENERATE
SOMETHING CALLED A WORD CLOUD, A
VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF YOUR
MOST FREQUENTLY USED WORDS.
THE MORE YOU USE THEM, THE
LARGER THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE
CLOUD.
SO, NATION, I GIVE YOU WHAT YOU
STAND FOR!
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, THERE IT IS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
EVIDENTLY MARIJUANA VERY HIGH ON
YOUR LIST.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE FORWARDED ALL YOUR
CONTACT INFORMATION TO THE
D.E.A. SO THEY CAN FIND OUT JUST
HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT IT.
YOUR VOICES WILL BE HEARD.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FOLKS, WHILE THIS IS GOOD,
THIS TELLS US A LOT, I BELIEVE
DEMOCRACY MEANS ONE MAN, ONE
VOTE FOR ONE DOLLAR.
(LAUGHTER)
REMEMBER, SUPER PACS ONLY EXIST
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT RULED
THAT MONEY EQUALS SPEECH.
SO WE GENERATED ANOTHER WORD
CLOUD.
IF YOU GAVE ME ONE DOLLAR, YOU
GOT ONE VOTE.
$100, A HUNDRED VOTES.
MEANING WHILE THIS IS WHAT YOU
SAID, THIS IS WHAT I HEARD.
BOOM!
AS YOU CAN SEE, MARIJUANA NOW
MUCH SMALLER.
(LAUGHTER)
I CAN BARELY READ IT,
PARTICULARLY WITH MY GLAUCOMA.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, THAT'S A LESSON TO YOUR
STONERS.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE... IF YOU STONERS
WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SPEND
LESS ON THE WHACKY TABACCY, MORE
ON THE SUPER PACY.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, I LOOK AROUND HERE, I'M
SEEING EDUCATION, I'M SEEING
PEOPLE, TAX AND GOVERNMENT NO
(BLEEP)ING IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, BUT FOR HELP ON CRAFTING A
MESSAGE I WENT TO AMERICA'S
FOREMOST EXPERT ON HELPING
PEOPLE REALIZE HOW THEY ALREADY
FEEL.
FRANK LUNTZ.
THIS IS THE MAN THAT REFRAMED
THE ESTATE TAX AS THE DEATH TAX.
HEALTH CARE REFORM AS GOVERNMENT
TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE.
NOW, SOME CRITICS HAVE CALLED
LUNTZ A SPIN DOCTOR WHO
MANIPULATES PUBLIC EMOTIONS, BUT
LUNTZ WOULD REFRAME THAT AS FOX
NEWS ANALYST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FRANK
