>> Stephen: WELCOME BACKEVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, PRIMARY SEASON IS UPONUS AND I COULD NOT BE MORE
EXCITED.
FINALLY A CHANCE TO SEE SOMEFRESH NEW FACES BEING
BANKROLLED BY THE SAME OLDFACES.
(LAUGHTER)AND FOLKS, NO FACE NEEDS
FRESHENING MORE THAN MITCHMcCONNELL.
I HAVE RECENTLY ALWAYS BEENOPPOSED TO MITCH McCONNELL.
HE CLAIMS TO BE A SMALLGOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE, YET
HE WORKS FOR THE UNITEDSTATES SENATE, PICK A SIDE,
SIR, THANKFULLY McCONNELL ISFACING A STRONG PRIMARY
CHALLENGE FROM KENTUCKY TEAPARTY DARLING MATT BEVIN,
THIS WILL BE HIS CLOSESTRACE SINCE HE BEAT THAT
HAIR.
BUT NOW, BUT NOW THE LIBERAL,YOU ALL KNOW-- THE LIBERAL
KENTUCKY MEDIA IS GOINGAFTER MY MAN BEVIN JUST
BECAUSE HE SPOKE AT ACOCKFIGHTING RALLY.
FOLKS, THAT'S JUST GOODPOLITICS.
A CANDIDATE HAS TO REACH ALLCONSTITUENCIES.
SOCCER MOMS, COCKFIGHTINGDADS, BEAR BAITING UNCLES,
HORSEWHIPPING SISTERS IN LAW,AND PERSONALLY I WAS
THRILLED WHEN I HEARD ABOUTBEVIN'S CONNECTION TO
GAMECOCKERY.
LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THEREPORT KNOW SOMETHING KNOW
I'M SOMETHING OF ACOCK-THUSIAST.
THERE IS NO GREATER RUSHTHAN WATCHING A FILIPINO
BLUE FACE GO BEAK TO BEAKWITH A CHINESE SILKE, THE
SMELL OF THE DUST, THE GLEAMOF THE BLADE, THE CALL OF
PEPE THE TOOTHLESS BOOKIE.
IT IS THE SWEET SCIENCEFOLLOWED SHORTLY BY THE
SAVORY SOUP.
BUT APPARENTLY, AND I DIDNOT KNOW THIS, SOME
SO-CALLED AMERICANS OPPOSEMAKING ROOSTERS FIGHT TO THE
DEATH.
THEY PREFER THEIR POULTRY TOBE HUMANELY CRAMMED INTO A
CRATE AND COMPASSIONATELYBEHEADED BY A HOMICIDAL
CONVEYER BELT.
SO NOW ATTACK CHICKENS ARECIRCLING MATT BEVIN WITH THE
HUMANE SOCIETY CALLING FORHIM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE
RACE.
THANKFULLY, BEVIN HAS APERFECTLY REASONABLE
EXPLANATION FOR WHY HE SPOKEAT THE COCKFIGHTING RALLY.
HE DID NOT REALIZE THE EVENTHAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
COCKFIGHTING.
I MEAN HOW-- HOW COULD HE! HOWCOULD HE KNOW THE EVENT WAS
HOSTED BY THE AMERICANGAMEFOUL DEFENSE NETWORK.
THAT NAME COULD MEANANYTHING.
I MEAN IT COULD BE ABOUTGIVING ASSAULT RIFLES TO
ROOSTERS.
I WOULD PAY TO SEE THAT.
AND AS BEVIN POINTED OUT, LIFEON THE TRAIL MOVES TOO FAST
TO NOTICE DETAILS LIKE WHOYOU ARE TALKING TO.
JIM?
>> I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TOSPEAK AND THEN I HAD TO
BOOGIE BECAUSE I HAD TO GETTO OWENSBORO WHERE I WAS
ALSO SPEAKING AT ANUNBRIDLED LIBERTY RALLY.
>> Stephen: YES, HE'S MOVINGALL OVER THE STATE, SPEAKING
HERE, SPEAKING THERE, HISHANDLERS DRIVE HIM AROUND IN
A WINDOWLESS VAN WITH A BAGON HIS HEAD AND WHIP IT OFF
AND HE JUST GOES FOR ITLIBERTY, AND THEN BACK IN
THE BAG.
AND-- (APPLAUSE)
>> AND AS A MEMBER OF THETEA PARTY, BEVIN WANTS
EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THEREPUGNANT PRACTICE OF
COCKFIGHTING WHICH HE IN NOWAY CONDONES IS ALSO A PROUD
AMERICAN TRADITION.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK ATCOCKFIGHTING AND DOGFIGHTING
AS WELL.
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING NEW.
THE FOUNDING FATHERS WEREALL, MANY OF THEM ACTIVELY
INVOLVED IN THIS AND ALWAYSHAVE BEEN.
>> Stephen: YES.
THEY ALL, THEY WERE ACTIVELYINVOLVED IN COCKFIGHTING AND
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
WHICH MEANS THERE MUST BECOCKFIGHTING IN HEAVEN.
THOUGH TECHNICALLY THEYSTRAP SPURS ON THE ANGELS
AND MAKE THEM GO AT IT.
THE POINT IS, OUR FOUNDERSDID IT.
IT IS OUR HERITAGE.
AND SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY.
THE SAME REASON WE SHOULDALL BE DUALING WITH PISTOLS
AND BONING OUR SLAVES.
SO LAYOFF MATT BEVIN.
HE DOES NOT CONDONE IT BUTIF YOU ARE GOING TO HOLD A
RALLY TO SUPPORTCOCKFIGHTING, HE WILL BE
THERE AND NOT KNOW WHY.WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
