YOUR HOME APPLIANCES KILL YOU?
I'LL SAY THIS: IT'S HARD TO GET
AN EVEN TAN WITH A WAFFLE IRON.
THEN, CONGRESSIONAL NAME
CALLING.
WHAT MOTIVATES THESE POO-POO
JERK-BUTTS?
AND MY GUEST AMY CHUA HAS
WRITTEN A CONTROVERSIAL BOOK
THAT SAYS CHINESE MOTHERS ARE
BETTER THAN AMERICAN MOTHERS --
IN BED.
THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS
STRONG, THOUGH I THINK IT MAY BE
JUICING.
THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."
