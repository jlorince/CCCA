(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, BEFORE THE BREAK WE WERE DISCUSSING THE BRAVE FISCAL MINISTRY OF CONGRESSMAN PAUL
RYAN WHO SAYS HIS DEEP BUDGET CUTS TO PROGRAMS FOR THE POOR ARE IN CONCORDANCE WITH CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
NOW, IN RESPONSE, THE U.S.
CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS REPLIED-- AND I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING MY LATIN CORRECTLY--
BULL (BLEEP) (LAUGHTER) PLUS, THE JESUITS IN THE GEORGETOWN MAFIA SENT RYAN A
NASTY LETTER SAYING "YOUR BUDGET APPEARS TO REFLECT THE VALUES OF
YOUR FAVORITE PHILOSOPHER AYN RAND RATHER THAN THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) RAND, OF COURSE, BELIEVED THAT THE ONLY RATIONAL BEHAVIOR IS TO
PURSUE YOUR OWN SELFISH INTERESTS.
A BELIEF SHARED BY RAND ADMIRERS LIKE RON PAUL, CLARENCE THOMAS,
AND SCROOGE McDUCK.
WLAF LAUGH RYE QLAN HAS DEFENDED HIMSELF SAYING HIS REPUTATION AS AN AYN RAND FOLLOWER WAS SIMPLY
AN "URBAN LEGEND." EXACTLY!
HIM ADMIRING RAND IS LIKE BIG FOOT-- IF BIG FOOT HAD SPOKEN AT A CELEBRATION OF AYN RAND'S
100th BIRTHDAY AND SAID THIS:
>> I GREW UP READING AYN RAND...
(LAUGHTER) ... AND IT TAUGHT ME QUITE A BIT ABOUT WHO I AM AND WHAT MY VALUE
SYSTEMS ARE AND WHAT MY BELIEFS ARE.
IT INSPIRED ME SO MUCH THAT IT'S REQUIRED READING IN MY OFFICE
FOR ALL MY INTERNS AND MY STAFF.
(LAUGHTER) THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE BY AND LARGE, IF
I HAD TO CREDIT ONE THINKER, ONE PERSON, IT WOULD BE AYN RAND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW, NOW FOLKS, I KNOW YOU THINK YOU HEARD THAT,
BUT IT WAS JUST AN URBAN LEGEND.
IT WAS PROBABLY SWAMP GAS REFLECTING OFF A WEATHER BALLOON AND VENUS WAS RIGHT... IT'S IN
THE "X FILES." THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.
(LAUGHTER) AND THE PRIEST WHO WROTE THAT NASTY LETTER TO RYAN HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR.
HERE TO ANSWER FOR IT, PLEASE WELCOME FROM GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY FATHER THOMAS REESE.
FATHER REESE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FATHER REESE, I DON'T GET YOUR PROBLEM OR THE U.S. CONFERENCE
OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS PROBLEMS WITH RYAN'S BUDGET.
JESUS SAID "WHATEVER YOU DO FOR THE LEAST OF MY BROTHERS THAT YOU DO UNTO ME."
AND ALL RYAN IS SUGGEST IS THAT WE DO THE LEAST WE CAN.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S PARAPHRASING BUT IT'S BASIC IDEA.
>> I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I MEAN, JESUS ALSO SAID THAT WE WOULD BE JUDGED BY WHETHER WE FED THE HUNGRY, GAVE DRINK TO
THE THIRSTY, CLOTHED THE NAKED.
AND THIS BUDGET DOESN'T DO IT.
WE BELIEVE THAT A BUDGET IS A MORAL DOCUMENT.
IT REPRESENTS THE VALUES OF A COUNTRY, OF A NATION, AND THE VALUES IN THIS BUDGET ARE THAT
WE WOULD RATHER CUT TAXES FOR THE RICH THAN HELP THE POOR AND THAT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
NOW JESUS DID SAY...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JESUS DID SAY IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO PASS THROUGH THE EYE OF
THE A NEEDLE THAN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.
BUT HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT JOB CREATORS.
(LAUGHTER) AND THAT'S WHAT RYAN'S TALKING ABOUT HERE.
RYAN IS TALKING ABOUT KEEPING THE MONEY WITH THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS SO THEY CAN CREATE JOBS.
IT'S CALLED TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS, ALL RIGHT?
SO YOU GUYS IN THE CHURCH, YOU TRICKLE DOWN ALL THE TIME.
YOU TRICKLE THAT HOLY WATER ON.
(LAUGHTER) YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO IT AND RYAN'S NOT.
WHAT... DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND TRICKLE DOWN.
>> I THINK IN THE GOSPEL IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT JESUS REACHED
OUT AND HELPED THE POOR, HELPED THE SICK AND THIS IS WHAT HE CALLS US TO DO AS HIS DISCIPLES.
WE'RE TO SHOW ONE ANOTHER THAT WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND FOLLOW CHRIST IN CARING FOR THE SICK,
CARING FOR THE POOR AND GIVING PEOPLE A HAND UP SO THAT THEY CAN DO THESE THINGS.
>> Stephen: HE SAID "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR," OKAY?
BUT I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY WELL-OFF NEIGHBORS.
SO IF I LET THEM KEEP THEIR TAX CUTS AREN'T I LOVING MY NEIGHBOR?
DOES MY NEIGHBOR HAVE TO BE THE POOR GUY?
WHY CAN'T MY NEIGHBOR BE THE RICH GUY?
>> WELL, I THINK... THE WAY WE LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR WHO ARE RICH IS WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE GOOD CHRISTIANS.
AND HELP THE THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED PAY THEIR TAXES.
JESUS DID SAY TO PAY YOUR TAXES.
AND TO HELP PEOPLE IN THAT WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART.
BUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
THAT'S SOCIALISM.
>> SHOCKING, ISN'T IT?
>> Stephen: THAT'S SOCIALISM.
JESUS DID NOT ROOM WITH KARL MARX, OKAY?
LAST TIME I CHECKED, SIR.
>> LAST TIME I CHECKED, HOWEVER,
THOUGH, POPE BENEDICT, WHO IS NOT KNOWN AS A LIBERAL, SAID ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF GOVERNMENT IS
TO REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH TO HELP POOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A CHANCE.
THAT WE SHOULD NOT CONCENTRATE ALL THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD IN THE HANDS OF A VERY FEW PEOPLE
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT IF WE DID KEEP THE WEALTH IN THE HANDS OF THE
WEALTHIEST PEOPLE, WOULDN'T THAT BE GOOD FOR THE KIDS WHO WANT TO GO TO GEORGETOWN BECAUSE IT
COSTS LIKE $800,000 A YEAR TO GO THROUGH NOW, DOESN'T IT?
THAT'S A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL,
ISN'T IT PADRE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THIS IS WHY WE'RE ALSO VERY UPSET ABOUT THE CUTS IN PELL GRANTS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SIR, I TEACH SUNDAY SCHOOL, JESUS DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT PELL GRANTS.
(LAUGHTER) FATHER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FATHER TOM REESE FROM GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY.
