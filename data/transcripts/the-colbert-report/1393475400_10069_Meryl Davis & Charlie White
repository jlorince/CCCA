AND THEN STAYING TO FOR 17YEARS?
>> I MEAN WE GIVE A LOT OFCREDIT TO OUR PARENTS FOR
THAT.
OUR PARENTS HAD KIND OFSIMILAR OUTLOOKS ON RAISING
CHILDREN AND WE GOT VERYFORTUNATE IN THAT RESPECT.
>> WE HAVE A LITTLE FOOTAGEOF YOU GUYS, I'M NOT SURE
HOW OLD YOU GUYS ARE HERE, BUTYOU CAN ROLL THAT.
>> YEAH IT WAS PROBABLY, IMEAN I WAS PROBABLY 9,
CHARLIE IS PROBABLY 8 THERE.
>> Stephen: NOW AS TEENAGERS,YOU ARE 8 AND 9 BUT AS
TEENAGERS AT ANY POINT DOYOU THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND
GO "THIS IS STUPID, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS ANY
MORE."
OR DOES THE DEDICATION STAYALL THE WAY THROUGH.
>> I THINK IT GREW.

INTO.
BUT WE LOVED THE SPORT.

EVER-- DID YOU CONSTANTLYALL 17 YEARS.

MISS AN IMPORTANT SEASON ATTHE LEVEL BELOW WHERE WE ARE
AT NOW.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOUBREAK IT.

>> Stephen: OH, OKAY SO, YOU ARE A HOCKEY PLAYER AS WELL.
>> YEAH SO, I ALSO GREW UPPLAYING HOCKEY.
>> Stephen: DOES ANY OF THEHOCKEY EVER COME OUT ON THE
ICE DANCING RINK?
LIKE IF YOU GET A LOW SCOREDO YOU EVER WANT TO PULL ONE
OF THE JUDGE'S T-SHIRTS OVERTHEIR HEAD AND JUST WHACK.
>> NO I MEAN CHARLIE HAS AREALLY ATHLETIC SKATING
STYLE WHICH HAS REALLY SERVEDUS INCREDIBLY WELL.

>> I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TALKABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS HAVETHE MOST AMAZING CHEMISTRY
ON THE ICE.
THE EXPRESSIVENESS, THEEMOTION IS SO INCREDIBLE.
AMERICA WANTS TO KNOW, DOYOU GUYS HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
OFF THE ICE.

>> NO, WE'RE NOT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT.
>> WE'RE NOT.
>> Stephen: WELL, I-- REFUSETO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE IF
THIS IS A LIE THEN ALL LOVEIS A LIE.
YOU KNOW, GROWN MEN IN TEARSAT YOUR FINAL PERFORMANCE.
OKAY, I NEED TO MOVE ON.
WHAT SHOULD I BE LOOKING ATWHEN I LOOK AT ICE DANCING
AS OPPOSED TO LOOK AT FIGURESKATING.
>> SO ICE DANCING IS A PARTOF FIGURE SKATING.
THERE'S MEN'S SINGLE, LADIESSINGLES, PAIR SKATING AND
ICE DANCING.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WILLOFTENTIMES ASK US WHAT IS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAIRSKATING AND ICE DANCING.
>> Stephen: I THINK I JUSTDID.
>> SO IN PAIRS SKATING, YOUFEEL A LOT MORE OVERHEAD
LIFTS, YOU SEE THROWS ANDSIDE-BY-SIDE JUMPS.
IN ICE DANCE, YOU KNOW, THECHOREOGRAPHY IS MUCH CLOSER
TOGETHER, THE FOOTWORK ISMORE INTRICATE, OUR LIFTS
ARE A BIT MORE ACROBATIC.
YOU REALLY SEE THAT WE'RETRYING TO TELL A STORY OUT
THERE ON THE ICE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS A TWIZZLEBECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THROWING THAT WORD AROUNDPRETTY CARELESSLY.

>> Stephen: THANK YOU, THANKYOU.
IS THERE TRASH TALK INOLYMPIC ICE DANCING LIKE
BACKSTAGE ARE PEOPLE GOING,YOU LOOK A LITTLE CHUNKY?
OR-- IS THEREANY-- IS IT A PSYCHOLOGICAL
GAME AT ALL.

OTHER PEOPLE.
BUT -->> THAT'S ALL YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW LET'S TALKABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE
ROOM, CHARLIE.

I'M NOT SUGGESTING THATEITHER OF YOU IS ON
PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS.
BUT YOUR HAIR MUST BE DOPING,RIGHT?
>> I'M NOT AT LIBERTY-- .
>> Stephen: OKAY, DONE,EXTENSIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELYA PART OF OUR PERSONA ON THE
ICE.
I CAN SAY THAT.
I THINK IT'S SET US APART.
