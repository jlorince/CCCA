NATION, ANYONE WHO WATCHED THE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS LAST MONTH KNOWS THAT OBAMACARE IS ON
LIFE SUPPORT, AND JUSTICE SCALIA IS ABOUT TO PUT A PILLOW OVER ITS FACE.
I'M SO RELIEVED THAT WE'RE GETTING RID OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE BEFORE THE UNTHINKABLE
HAPPENS, LIKE, IT WORKS.
NOW, SURE, ONCE OBAMACARE IS DEAD, WE'LL STILL HAVE OVER 50 MILLION UNINSURED PEOPLE, BUT
REPUBLICANS HAVE A PLAN TO EVENTUALLY COME UP WITH A PLAN.
SHOULD BE ANY DAY NOW BECAUSE JOHN BOEHNER WAS SPOTTED AT STAPLES BUYING A DRY ERASE BOARD.
FUN FACT-- HUFF ENOUGH OF THOSE MARKERS AND THAT'S AN ANESTHETIC.
BESIDES-- ( APPLAUSE ).
( CHEERS ) BESIDES, FOLKS, WE KNOW AMERICA
ALREADY HAS A SAFETY NET FOR THE SICK.
>> YOU CAN WALK INTO ANY EMERGENCY ROOM IN AMERICA AND A DOCTOR CANNOT TURN AROUND AND
SAY, "I'M NOT GOING TO TREAT YOU." SO YOU CAN GET HEALTH CARE.
>> Stephen:  YES, BY LAW,
EMERGENCY ROOMS CAN'T TURN ANYONE AWAY.
AND THEY'RE GREAT FOR ALL KIND OF CARE-- BRING YOUR CHILD IN WITH AN EAR ACHE, AND BY THE
TIME YOU'RE SEEN BY A DOCTOR HE'LL BE A HEALTHY 32-YEAR-OLD.
( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, EMERGENCY CARE IS PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE.
IN 2010 ALONE, HOSPITALS RACKED UP $39.3 BILLION IN UNPAID EMERGENCY ROOM CARE.
THAT LAESTLESZ HOSPITALS HOLDING THE SHORT END OF THE STICK, AND THIS BEING AN EMERGENCY ROOM,
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE OTHER END IS LODGED.
LUCKILY, THERE'S A WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM, AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DEBT PANELS.
FOLKS, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR AMERICA'S UNINSURED-- TAKE SOME PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE, THEN MOVE SOME PLACE WITHOUT BACTERIA.
( LAUGHTER ) YOU SEE, THE GOOD NEWS IS ONE COMPANY HAS STEPPED UP TO HOLD
THESE NOS-QUITE-DEAD-YET BEATS ACCOUNTABLE.
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES," ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST COLLECTORS OF MEDICAL
DEBT HAS START THE EMBEDDING ITS EMPLOYEES INTO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS WITHOUT
IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS DEBT COLLECTORS AND DEMAND PATIENTS PAY BEFORE THEY GET TREATMENT.
THAT'S RIGHT, UNINSURED-- AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM BEFORE THEY CHECK
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE THEY MIGHT JUST CHECK YOUR CREDIT RATING.
NOW HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
( LAUGHTER ).
THESE UNDERCOVER DEBT COLLECTORS REGISTER INCOMING PATIENTS, THEN
STALL THEM UNTIL THEY'VE AGREED TO PAY A PREVIOUS BALANCE AND IN
SOME CASES DISCOURAGE THEM FROM SEEKING EMERGENCY CARE AT ALL.
IT'S WIN-WIN-- DEBT COLLECTORS GET THEIR MONEY, AND IF YOU STALL A SICK PATIENT LONG
ENOUGH, THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MEDICAL BILL.
( LAUGHTER ).
ACCRETIVE TRACKED WHETHER PATIENTS PAID THEIR BILLS USING A COMPUTER SYSTEM NICKNAMED BLUE BALLS.
INCIDENTALLY, IF A NURSE OFFERS TO TREAT YOUR BLUE BECAUSE,
YOU'RE NOT IN A HOSPITAL.
( LAUGHTER ).
NATION-- I SAY-- ( APPLAUSE ).
I THINK YOU'LL PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME ON THIS ONE-- I SAY IT'S
ABOUT TIME WE STARTED SQUEEZE,
SOME HEALTH CARE DOLLARS OUT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE.
AND, LOOK, IF THE PATIENTS DON'T HAVE CASH, THEY CAN PAY WITH A
CREDIT CARD, MAYBE RACK UP SOME MILES.
AND, FOLKS, THIS SOLUTION IS NOT LIMITED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
ACCRETIVE ALSO TOLD EMPLOYEES TO, "GET CRACKING ON LABOR AND DELIVERY SINCE THERE IS A GOOD
CHUNK TO BE COLLECTED THERE." AND, FOLKS, THERE IS NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A MOTHER'S
SHINING FACE DURING THE MIRACLE OF BEING DENIED AN EPIDURAL UNTIL SHE PUSHES OUT SOME DOUGH.
BUT, FOLKS, DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
LISTEN TO ONE OF ACCRETIVE'S SATISFIED CUSTOMERS.
>> SHE DEVELOPED A KIDNEY STONE AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE E.R.
>> I WAS IN MY LITTLE ROOM WAITING FOR THE, TO THE TO COME,
WRITHING IN PAIN.
>> INSTEAD OF A DOCTOR SHE WAS GREETED BY A HIGH-PRESSURE BILL COLLECTOR.
>> Stephen:  OF COURSE YOU PAY UP FRONT.
FROM NOW ANESTHESIA SHOULD BE COIN OPERATED.
PLUS IF THE MONEY MEN CAN PRETEND TO BE E.R. RECEPTIVITIES WHY CAN'T THEY PRETEND TO BE DOCTORS?
I MEAN, DON'T WORRY, THEY WON'T DENY CARE.
IF YOU NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY THEY WILL OPEN YOU UP FREE OF CHARGE.
THEY JUST WON'T SEW UP UNTIL YOU SWIPE YOUR CAPITOL 1 CARD.
AND EVERYONE WILL LEAVE THE HOSPITAL DEBT FREE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY THE SURGEON
WILL JUST TAKE A KIDNEY AS COLLATERAL.
THE POINT IS THERE ARE PLENTY OF GREAT, FREE-MARKET ALTERNATIVES TO OBAMACARE THAT WILL SATISFY
BOTH THE PATIENTS AND THE HOSPITALS.
SO WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A BUREAUCRAT COMING BETWEEN AND YOU YOUR DOCTORS.
JUST A REPO MAN.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
