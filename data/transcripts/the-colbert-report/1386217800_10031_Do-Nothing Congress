>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WELCOME TOTONIGHT'S EPISODE OF THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,GOOD TO YOU HAVE IN THERE,
OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THEWORLD, FOLKS.
HI AM SO GLAD TO BE ALIVE.
WHAT A TIME TO BE IN THE NEWSBIZ.
I MEAN BETWEEN THE HOLIDAYS,COME ON.
EVENTS ARE UNFOLDING ALLOVER VARIOUS PLACES.
YESTERDAY FOX NEWS'S THEFIVE HELD A ROUND TABLE ON A
HOUSTON SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORWHO SAID ITS STUDENTS
DRESSED LIKE HOES.
AND OVER ON CNN JAKETAPPER'S LEAD STORY WAS
ABOUT DOING BOB DYLAN FORSOMETHING HE SAID TWO YEARS
AGO.
SO THOSE STORIES ARECOVERED.
AND YOU KNOW WHERE THINGSARE ALWAYS HAPPENING?
>> WASHINGTON D.C.
WHERE CONGRESS ONLY HAS TENWORKDAYS LEFT.
SO YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TOBE A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY AS
THEY PACK FOR VACATION.
BECAUSE, FOLKS, THISCONGRESS HAS EARNED A VERY
SPECIAL DISTINCTION.
>> THE 113th CONGRESS ISABOUT TO GO DOWN AS THE
LEAST PRODUCTIVE IN OURAMERICAN HISTORY.
>> IF YOU CAN BELIEVE ITONLY 55 BILLS HAVE BEEN SIGN
MOOD LAW THIS YEAR, THATMAKES THIS THE LEAST
PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS EVER.
>> THE LEAST PRODUCTIVECONGRESS IN THE HISTORY OF
THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC.
>> IT LITERALLY IS ADO-NOTHING CONGRESS.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT'S NOTFAIR.
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING.
THEY'RE GETTING INTO THEGUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD
RECORDS.
AND FOLKS, THAT MAKES ITTWICE, IF YOU COUNT JOHN
BOEHNER'S FINGERNAILS.
NOW IT'S NOT EASY.
NOW SURE, THE 113th HASN'TPASSED A BILLS EVERY
CONGRESS DOES LIKE A HIGHWAYBILL OR DEFENSE BILL OR FARM
BILL OR A BUDGET.
BUT I MEAN WHAT DO WE NEED ABUDGET FOR.
CLEARLY NOT FOR HIGHWAYS,DEFENSE.
OR FOOD, THEY DID PASS ABILL ENSURING PEOPLE CAN
FISH ON DAMS NEAR THECUMBERLAND RIVER AND PASSED
DEEP CUTS IN FOOD STAMPS FORTHE POOR WHICH IS GOOD SOLID
GOVERNING BECAUSE THE POORDON'T NEED FOOD STAMPS ANY
MORE NOW THAT THEY CAN FISHNEAR DAMS ON THE CUMBERLAND
RIVER.
REMEMBER, REMEMBER THE OLDSAYING, GIVE A MAN A FISH
WILL EAT FOR A DAY.
TAKE AWAY HIS FOOD STAMPS,MAYBE HE WON'T.
(LAUGHTER)AND FOLKS, I'M EXCITED-- I'M
SO EXCITED TO HAVE OTHERSREPORT THAT THERE'S BEEN AN
EVEN BIGGER BIPARTISANACHIEVEMENT.
>> CONGRESS IS ABOUT TOSHELL OUT $55 MILLION TO PAY
FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS FORA GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES.
THE 300 CHIMPS ARE PART OF ARESEARCH TESTING FACILITY
WHO ARE BEING SENT TO AHABITAT IN LOUISIANA TO LIVE
OUT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
THE MONEY WILL BE USED TOPROVIDE THE ANIMALS WITH
HOUSING, FOOD AND MEDICALCARE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FORRESEARCH CHIMPS TO RETIRE TO
LOUISIANA.
BECAUSE NOT EVENPSYCHOLOGICALLY SCARRED
APRILS WANT TO LIVE INFLOOR-- AIRPORTS WANT TO
LIVE IN FLORIDA.
NATION-- (APPLAUSE)
BIG SUNSHINE STATE FANSTONIGHT.
NATION, THIS IS GREAT NEWS.
BECAUSE IT MEANS CONGRESSCAN AGREE ON A SOCIAL SAFETY
NET AS LONG AS IT'S NOT FORHUMAN BEINGS.
AND IF THEY'RE WILLING TOREWARD RESEARCH CHIMPS WITH
CURBY RETIREMENT, I SEE NOREASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T JUST
OFFER THE SAME DEAL TO OURELDERLY.
AS LONG AS WE CAN USE THEMFOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS
FIRST.
FACE IT, COME ON, FACE IT.
THEY ALREADY SWALLOWWHATEVER PILLS YOU PUT IN
THE TRAY.
AND SINCE WE WON'T NEEDCHIMPS FOR RESEARCH ANY MORE,
WE CAN HAVE THEM DO ALL THETHINGS CONGRESS REFUSES TO
PAY PEOPLE TO DO.
LIKE REBUILDING OUR BRIDGESOR PAVING OUR HIGHWAYS.
I MEAN IT WOULD BE SO MUCHBETTER BECAUSE A CHIMP ON A
TRICYCLE IS FUNNY BUT ACHIMP ON A STEAMROLLER,
HILARIOUS.
COME TO THINK OF IT, WHYDON'T WE JUST PUT THE CHIMPS
IN CONGRESS.
AFTER ALL, THEY'VE GOT A LOTOF EXPERIENCE--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)-- THEY'VE GOT THE
EXPERIENCE YOU NEED.
THEY JERK OFF IN PUBLIC ANDTHROW
