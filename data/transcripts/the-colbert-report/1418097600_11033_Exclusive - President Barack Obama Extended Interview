>> Stephen: WELL, LET'S TALKABOUT THE JOBS OUT THERE AND HOW
MANY OF THEM WILL BE TAKEN BYALL THE IMMIGRANTS YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP IN THIS COUNTRY.
(LAUGHTER)YOU REALIZE YOU'RE AN EMPEROR
NOW.
IT HAS BEEN DECLARED.
YOU ARE BARACKUS MAXIMUS THEFIRST
I'M A CHRISTIAN.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO THROW ME TOTHE LIONS?
I WOULD BE DELICIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)WHY DID YOU BURN THE
CONSTITUTION AND BECOME ANEMPEROR?
>> ACTUALLY, STEPHEN, EVERYTHINGWE'VE DONE IS SCRUPULOUSLY
WITHIN THE LAW AND HAS BEEN DONEBY PREVIOUS DEMOCRATIC AND
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS.
CONGRESS PASSES LAWS.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EXECUTE THEM.
WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATIONLAWS, IN THE SAME WAY THAT
RONALD REAGAN AND THE TWO BUSHPRESIDENTS DID, WE HAVE TO MAKE
DECISIONS.
WE'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OFENFORCEMENT RESOURCES.
WHO IS IT THAT WE'RE GOINGAFTER?
>> Stephen: PREVIOUS DECISIONSIN THE WAKE OF LAWS THAT HAD
BEEN PASSED BUT THEY CHANGED THEIMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE LAWS?
THIS IS JUST YOU SAYING,
I DECLARE!
>> NO, ACTUALLY STEPHEN.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSESITUATIONS WAS CONGRESS PASSED
LAWS AND DELIBERATELY LEFT OUTSOME THINGS THE PRESIDENT WANTED
BUT THEY STILL THOUGHT IT WASTHE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> Stephen: BUT LAWS ARE LIKEJAZZ!
IT'S THE PARTS YOU DON'T PASS!
(LAUGHTER)>> HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON.
YOU WENT FROM THE CAESARMETAPHOR TO THE JAZZ METAPHOR
AND I GOT ALL CONFUSED.
SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACKTO IMMIGRATION.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WE CAN'T DEPORT 11 MILLIONFOLKS WHO ARE HERE, THE VAST
MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE GOODPEOPLE, WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO
GET AHEAD AND TRYING TO MAKE --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO INSTEAD OF DEVOTING A WHOLELOT OF RESOURCES ON SEPARATING
FAMILIES, GRABBING SOME MOMWHO'S WORKING IN A HOTEL OR SOME
DAD WHO'S WORKING IN A KITCHENSOMEWHERE, AND SEPARATING THEM
OUT, LET'S FOCUS ON DEPORTINGFELONS.
LET'S FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING THEBORDER.
LET'S FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THATTHE LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
WORKS BETTER. SO WHAT WE'RE DONGIS, WE'RE USING
PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION TODEPLOY RESOURCES
WISELY, AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THATTHE BEST THING AMERICA HAS GOING
FOR IT IS IMMIGRATION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BECAUSE EVERY GENERATION -- EACH
SUCCESSIVE GENERATION YOU'VESEEN THIS WAVE OF SMART,
STRIVING FOLKS WHO NOT ONLYBECOME AMERICANS THEMSELVES BUT
CREATE JOBS, CREATE BUSINESSES.
ABOUT HALF OF SILICON VALLEY'SCOMPANIES WERE FOUNDED BY
IMMIGRANTS, AND THOSE CREATEJOBS FOR EVERYBODY.
SO IT'S GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY ANDIT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
