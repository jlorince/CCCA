EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A HARVARD
PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY.
I'LL ASK HIM, WHAT IS THE SOUND
OF ONE AUDIENCE CLAPPING?
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL SANDELL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
PROFESSOR, PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.
SIR, LET'S GET THE CRM V. OUT
HERE.
IT'S KIND OF IMPRESSIVE FOR
THOSE WHO LIKE THINGS.
YOU'RE A PROFESSOR AT HARVARD,
SO YOU'RE SMARTY PANTS.
YOU HAVE THOUGHT POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY SINCE 1980.
YOU TEACH A SPECIAL
UNDERGRADUATE COURT CALLED
"JUSTICE."
15,000 STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN IT SO
FAR.
YOU CAN WATCH THIS ON YOUTUBE.
YOU CAN BUY THE WHOLE THING ON
D.V.D.
"JUSTICE: WHAT IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO."
I'LL BITE.
WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?
[LAUGHTER]
I GOT MY OWN ANSWER, BUT WHAT'S
YOUR ANSWER, SMARTY PANTS.
YEAH.
COME ON, YOU'RE THE TEACHER.
>> WELL, ESPECIALLY I TEACH BY
ASKING STUDENTS QUESTIONS.
>> Stephen: FIRE AWAY.
>> ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE TRY ONE?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> OKAY.
ALEX RODRIGUEZ OF THE YANKEES...
>> Stephen: SUCKS.
DID I GET THAT RIGHT?
DID I GET THAT RIGHT?
OVERPAID.
IS THAT THE ANSWER?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT HE MAKES, $25
MILLION A YEAR.
AN AVERAGE SCHOOLTEACHER.
WHAT DOES AN AVERAGE
SCHOOLTEACHER MAKE?
>> Stephen: $1.45.
[LAUGHTER]
>> ABOUT 45,000 A YEAR.
IS THAT FAIR?
>> Stephen: YES.
WHAT IS THE TEACHER'S BATTING
AVERAGE?
[LAUGHTER]
>> PROBABLY HIGHER THAN A-ROD'S
RIGHT NOW, BUT WHY... [AUDIENCE
REACTS]
>> Stephen: YEP.
>> WHY DOES A-ROD DESERVE TO
MAKE THAT MUCH MORE THAN A
SCHOOLTEACHER?
>> IT IS WHAT THE MARKET WILL
BEAR.
THE MARKET ALWAYS MAKES THE
RIGHT DECISION.
>> YOU THINK?
>> Stephen: CHECKMATE I THINK.
I THINK THAT WAS JUST CHECKMATE.
>> WELL, IT'S A GOOD ANSWER.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> BUT WHY?
THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET
MEASURES WHAT PEOPLE WANT.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY
FOR.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IF HE WASN'T WORTH
IT, HE WOULDN'T GET IT.
AND KEEP IN MIND, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT QED MEANS.
>> BUT YOU SAID BEFORE HE'S WAY
OVERPAID.
HOW CAN THAT BE?
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO EDIT
THAT PART OUT.
>> OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
SO THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, BUT
ULTIMATELY WE DON'T JUST STOP
WITH A-ROD'S SALARY AND THE
SCHOOLTEACHER'S, WE USE THOSE
EXAMPLES TO TEST BIG
PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS, JUSTICE,
FAIRNESS, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS,
PROPERTY RIGHTS, THE MEANING OF
THE COMMON GOOD, WHAT IS IT TO
BE A CITIZEN.
SO WHAT THE BOOK DOES AND WHAT
THE COURSE DOES IS TO TRY TO
CONNECT BIG IDEAS OF PHILOSOPHY
WITH THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE ABOUT
POLITICS AND ABOUT ETHICS EVERY
DAY.
AND MY HUNCH IS THAT IF WE DID
THAT IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE MORE
GENERALLY, OUR POLITICAL DEBATES
WOULD GO A LOT BETTER THAN
THEY'RE GOING TODAY.
>> Stephen: NOW I HAPPEN TO
THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO "WHAT
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO" IS IT
IS GENERALLY THAT THING THAT YOU
LEAST WANT TO DO.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S THE THING THAT NEVER FALLS
OFF YOUR LIST BUT IS ALWAYS AT
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR LIST.
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING THE
PAY SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT.
IS THAT ANYWHERE IN YOUR
EQUATION?
>> NO.
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
BUT IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.
AND THE CHALLENGE FOR POLITICS
AND FOR MORAL REASONING IS TO
SEE IF WE CAN DO A BETTER
JONATHAN WE ARE DOING THESE DAYS
AT REASONING, EVEN DISAGREEING
TOGETHER PUBLICLY ABOUT BIG
MORAL QUESTIONS.
SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IN THE
BOOK AND IN THIS COURSE AND IN
THE ONLINE SERIES IS TO PROVOKE
AND INVITE NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT
ALSO THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS OUR
DISAGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT
TAKES ON THESE BIG QUESTIONS.
>> Stephen: YOU LET THE PUBLIC
SEE THIS, BECAUSE I CAN GO ON
THE YOUTUBE AND WATCH THIS
LECTURE SERIES FOR FREE, AND
IT'S A FREE COURSE ON JUSTICE.
WOULD A STUDENT WHOSE FAMILY
PAID $50,000 TO GO TO HARVARD
FEEL LIKE THAT IS JUST?
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> I HOPE SOME
>> Stephen: YOU'RE BIG IN
ASIA, RIGHT?
THE ASIAN, AND I BELIEVE THAT'S
THE CORRECT TERM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE P.C. TERM IS NOW,
ASIANS, CHINESE ARE JUST
GOBBLING UP THIS BOOK.
IS THE BOOK THE SAME FOR ASIANS
OR ARE THERE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
OF WHAT IS JUST OR UNJUST IN
THOSE SOCIETIES?
>> WELL, THE BOOK IS THE SAME
EXCEPT THAT IT'S IN CHINESE
THERE, BUT THE ISSUE...
>> Stephen: THAT'S GOOD
MARKETING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> BUT I'VE BEEN ASTONISHED BY
THE REACTION IN EAST ASIA
GENERALLY NEW YORK CHINA AND
JAPAN AND KOREA.
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS A
GREAT HUNGER FOR ENGAGEMENT WITH
BIG ETHICAL QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS
OF POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THESE ETHICAL QUESTIONS.
YOU POSE VERY HARD ETHICAL
QUESTIONS TO YOUR STUDENTS,
QUESTIONS LIKE CANNIBALISM.
HOW DO YOU POSE THAT QUESTION?
>> WELL, IF YOU WERE STUCK IN A
LIFEBOAT, AND THIS IS A TRUE
STORY, STUCK IN A LIFEBOAT, FOUR
SAILORS, THEY'RE STARVING, DAYS
AND DAYS PASS AND THE CABIN BOY
IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIFEBOAT
ILL.
THE ONLY WAY THEY FEEL THEY CAN
SURVIVE, THE THREE OTHERS, IS TO
KILL AND EAT THE CABIN BOY.
WOULD THAT BE THE RIGHT THING TO
DO?
>> Stephen: IS HE WELL
MARBLED?
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE.
>> Stephen: YOU NEED TO KNOW
IF HE'S DELICIOUS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THAT'S AWFUL.
>> Stephen: YES, ABSOLUTELY.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S YOUR QUESTION.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO EAT
THE CABIN BOY.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID, THAT
GUY OVER THERE IS EASY PREY.
WHO IS THE SICK ONE HERE.
SO I WOULD SAY NO, IT'S NOT
RIGHT.
>> WHY NOT?
>> Stephen: BECAUSE IF I DO IT
TO HIM, SOMEBODY MIGHT DO IT TO
ME NEXT.
>> THEY MIGHT.
BUT YOU'RE...
>> Stephen: YOU SAY THEY
MIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY I'M NEXT.
LOOK AT ME.
I'M DELICIOUS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
PROFESSOR.
PROFESSOR MICHAEL SANDELL.
THE BOOK IS "JUSTICE: WHAT'S THE
RIGHT THING TO DO."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
