>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYTHING,MY GUEST TONIGHT IS
FROM-- PLEASE WELCOME SHERYLSANDBERG.
HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORCOMING ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU THECOO OF FACEBOOK.
BEFORE THAT YOU WORKED FORGOOGLE, WERE CHIEF OF STAFF
AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT,AN ECONOMIST AT THE WORLD
BANK.
YOU ARE ALSO A BEST SELLINGAUTHOR AND FOUNDER OF
LEANIN.ORG AND YOU GOT A NEWBOOK CALLED LEANIN FOR
GRADUATES.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
FIRST OF ALL, TELL ME, IHEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS LEANIN
THING.
OKAY.
CAN ANYBODY LEAN-IN OR DOONLY WOMEN LEAN-IN?
>> ANYONE CAN LEAN-IN.
ANYONE.
AND WE LIKE IT WHEN MEN DOIT AS WELL.
>> HOW-- DO MEN AND WOMENLEAN-IN DIFFERENTLY?
>> WELL, THEY LEAN-IN FORTHE SAME REASON, MAYBE
DIFFERENT.
THEY LEAN-IN TO CREATE ABETTER WORLD WHICH SHOULD BE
A MORE EQUAL WORLD.
ONE WHERE WOMEN RAN HALF OURCOMPANIES AND MAN RAN HALF
OUR HOMES.
AND SO THEY EACH HAVE THEIRPART TO PLAY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
NOW I READ A STUDY WHERE THEMORE HOUSEWORK MEN DO, THE
LESS SEX THEY HAVE.
>> SO THAT STUDY IS BASED ONA 1996 STUDY.
AND IT'S VERY OUT OF DATE.
HERE IS WHAT THE DATA SHOWS.
THE DATA SAYS THAT IF YOUSHARE CHORES MORE EVENLY
WHICH DOESN'T REALLY HAPPENNOW BUT COULD, YOU ARE
HAPPIERIER, IF ARE YOUHAPPIER YOU HAVE MORE SEX.
I TELL MEN IN YOU WANT MORESEX WITH YOUR WIFE, DON'T
BUY FLOWERS, DO LAUNDRY ANDTHIS WORKS.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THERE ADANGER I WILL END UP HAVING
SEX WITH THE MADE THOUGH?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> THIS WORKS.
>> Stephen: I'M ALL FORWOMEN WORKING.
I LOVE WOMEN WORKING.
I HAVE WOMEN WHO WORK HERE TTHEY ARE FANTASTIC.
YOU WORK.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: SO-- BUT WHATABOUT THE OLD THING I WAS
TOLD YOU KNOW I READ, YOUKNOW, I DIDN'T READ.
I HEARD, I HEARD THAT WOMENCAN'T HAVE IT ALL.
HOW DO THEY HAVE IT ALL.
WHAT ABOUT HAVING THEBABIES.
BECAUSE MEN THROUGH NO FAULTOF OUR OWN HAVE NO WOMB.
OKAY.
I'VE TRIED.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SO WE TELL WOMEN THEY CAN'THAVE IT ALL.
AND BY THAT MEAN THEY CAN'TWORK AND HAVE KIDS BUT
NASS'S ABSURD BECAUSE 70% OFMOTHERS IN OUR ECONOMY WORK
AND HAVE TO WORK.
AND SO THEY ARE GOING TOWORK AND HAVE KIDS.
AND THE WAY WE CAN GET THATTO WORK OUT IS IF WHEN WOMEN
ARE COMING INTO THEWORKFORCE, LIKE WE TRY TO
ADVISE IN THIS BOOK, THEYCAN REACH, GET THE RIGHT
JOBS, GET PAID THE SAME ASMEN.
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONSON EQUAL PAYDAY, BY THE WAY.
>> YEAH.
>> THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, WOMEN COME INTOTHE WORKFORCE, COME INTO THE
WORKFORCE AND THEY MAKE LESSTHAN MEN.
AND PART OF THE REASON ISTHAT THEY CAN'T NEGOTIATE AS
EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE WHEN AMAN NEGOTIATES, WE THINK HE
SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FORHIMSELF.
WHEN A WOMAN DOES-- .
>> Stephen: HELL YA, WE PUTOUR BALLS OUT THERE ON THE
TABLE.
I'M ALL IN, PUT THEM ON THEBELT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, A NEW KINDOF LEANING IN, BUT WHEN A
WOMEN NEGOTIATES SHE PAYS APENALTIES.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THEPENALTY.
>> THEY'RE NOT LIKED.
WHEN THEY ADVOCATE FORTHEMSELVES AND IF THEY ARE
NOT LIKED THEY DON'T GET THERAISES AND PROMOTIONS SO
THERE A CHAPTER IN THE NEWBOOK FROM A COMPENSATION
EXPERT AND SHE TEACHES WOMENHOW TO NEGOTIATE SO COMMUNAL
LANGUAGE.
EXPLAIN WHY THE SALARY AREYOU LOOKING FOR IS NOT JUST
IMPORTANT FOR YOU, BUT ITWILL HELP YOU DO A BETTER
JOB TO THE ORGANIZATION.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OFWOMEN NOT LOOKING OUT FOR
THEMSELVES AND NOT THINKINGTHEY CAN STAND UP FOR
THEMSELVES, SU HAVE APROBLEM WITH ITS WORD BOSSI.
>> WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITHTHE WORD BOSS, SOME PEOPLE
ARE BOSSI.
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT WORD ISUSED LOT MORE WITH -- IT IS
GETTING AT A VERY REALPROBLEM WHICH IS THAT BY
JUNIOR HIGH MORE GIRLS, POREBOYS WANT TO LEAD THAN
GIRLS.
AND WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHY,THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED
BOSSI.
AND SO WE PUT OUT A SERIESOF LEADERSHIP TIPS FOR
PARENTS HOW ALL OF US TREATOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS
EQUALLY.
AND FOR GIRLS BECAUSE IF WEWANT EQUAL REPRESENTATION AT
THE TABLE WHERE DECISIONSARE MADE, WE NEED TO
ENCOURAGE LEADERSHIP AND WENEED TO START YOUNG DOING.
>> Stephen: BUT ISN'T, YOUKNOW, TELLING PEOPLE WHAT
WORDS NOT TO SAY KIND OFPUSHY?
>> OR EVEN BOSSI.
>> Stephen: OH, I WOULDNEVER SAY BOSSI.
>> NEVER SAY BOSSI.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE SOMEONEMIGHT BITE MY HEAD OFF.
>> WELL, THIS GOES WAYBEYOND A WORD AND IT'S
REALLY ABOUT SYSTEMICENCOURAGEMENT OF LITTLE
GIRLS AND I THINK ISSOMETHING WE CAN CHANGE.
>> Stephen: I HAVE WOMEN INMY WIFE.
I HAVE A DAUGHTER.
HOW I DO ENCOURAGE HER TOLEAN IN.
SHE'S IN THE A GRADUATE YETBUT HOW DO I ENCOURAGE HER.
>> SO BY JUNIOR HIGH PARENTSHAVE HIGHER ASPIRATIONS IN
TERMS OF LEADERSHIP FORTHEIR SONS THAN THEIR
DAUGHTERS, SO WHEN THEY TALKTO THEIR SONS ABOUT THEIR
FUTURE, THEY ASK THEM, LIKEHOW ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE
THE WORLD, BIGGER QUESTIONS,WITH THE DAUGHTERS THEY
DON'T ASK THE SAMEQUESTIONS.
ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS LOOKAT YOUR DAUGHTER AND SAY HOW
ARE YOU GOING TO LEAN N WHATDO YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT.
>> Stephen: WHY DO I HAVE TOUSE THE NAME OF YOUR BOOK.
>> YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T.
THAT'S OPTIONAL.
IT'S OPTIONAL.
>> Stephen: S THIS'SINCREDIBLE.
MARKETING.
YOU JUST DID, IT WASAMAZING.
>> BUT THAT'S PART'SOPTIONAL BUT THE AMBITION IS
NOT OPTIONAL.
BECAUSE WE WANT TOENGRAIN-- EMBRACE AM BILLS.
NEXT TIME YOU SEE SOMEONECALL A LITTLE GIRL BOSSI
WALK UP TO THEM AND SAY THATLITTLE GIRL IS NOT BOSSI
THAT LITTLE GIRL HASEXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP SKILLS.
>> Stephen: SO GET OFF, GETOFF THE SEA SAW, IT'S HER
TURN.
>> OR SHARE THE SEESAWBECAUSE WILL YOU MAKE BETTER
DECISIONS TOGETHER.
WHEN WOMEN ARE AT THE TABLEMAKING DECISIONS WITH MEN, I
KNOW THAT IS HARD TO IMAGINE,BUT THE DECISIONS ARE
BETTER.
>> Stephen: WE'RE DOINGRIGHT NOW.
>> RIGHT NOW, HERE WE ARE.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU AT MYTABLE RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE SHARING OUR TABLE ANDWE'RE CHANGING THE WORLD ONE
WORD AT A TIME.
>> AND I APPRECIATE THATSSES YOU'RE WELCOME.
BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED MYPERMISSION, YOU COULD HAVE
COME AND DONE MY SHOWWITHOUT ASKING.
>> REALLY?
>> Stephen: YEAH, THIS ISYOUR TABLE TOO.
THINK ANY TIME.
