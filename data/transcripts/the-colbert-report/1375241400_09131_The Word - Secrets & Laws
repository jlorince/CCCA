FOOD CO-OP, RAINBOW WARRIOR.
NOW FORTUNATELY THERE'S A WAY
FOR LAWMAKERS TO DO THEIR JOBS
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES, AND IT
BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SECRETS AND LAWS.
NATION, LIKE ALL AMERICANS, I AM
CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE SENATE
FINANCE COMMITTEE'S EFFORT TO
DRAFT A NEW COMPREHENSIVE TAX
REFORM BILL.
NOW, FOLKS, THE COMMITTEE'S TOP
DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN,
SENATORS MAX BAUCUS AND/OR AND ORRIN
HATCH ARE ASKING THEIR SENATE
COLLEAGUES FOR SUGGESTIONS ON
THE NEW TAX CODE.
WHAT SHOULD BE DEDUBT I BELIEVE?
WHAT SHOULD THE TOP TAX RATE BE?
BUT THESE SENATORS KNOW IT IS
TOO RISKY FOR THE OTHER SENATORS
TO BE PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR PUBLIC
POLICY SO THEY ASSUREDDED
LAWMAKERS THAT ANY SUBMISSION
THEY RECEIVE WILL BE KEPT UNDER
LOCK AND KEY BY THE COMMITTEE
AND THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES UNTIL
THE END OF 2064.
THAT'S RIGHT.
NO ONE WILL SEE THE SENATORS'
OPINIONS ON THE TAX CODE FOR 50
YEARS.
AND BY THEN, FOLKS, THE SENATORS
WILL ALL BE DEAD.
NOW, TO FURTHER GUARANTEE
PRIVACY, BAUCUS AND HATCH HAVE
OFFERED TO GIVE EACH SUBMISSION
ITS OWN I.D. NUMBER, KEEP IT ON
PASSWORD-PROTECTED SERVERS AND
STORE PRINTEDDED VERSIONS IN
LOCKED SAFES.
THIS LEVEL OF SECRECY WILL GIVE
THE SENATORS THE FREEDOM TO DO
THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.
THAT WAY, THEY CAN REPRESENT THE
VOTERS WITHOUT PRESSURE FROM THE
LOBBYISTS OR REPRESENT THE
LOBBYISTS WITHOUT PRESSURE FROM
THE VOTERS.
IT COULD GO EITHER WAY.
WE'LL FIND OUT IN 2064.
OF COURSE, THE ONLY DANGER IS IF
THE TAX BILL SOMEHOW LATER COMES
UP FOR A VOTE, THEN MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS WILL BE IN THE PERILOUS
POSITION OF SUPPORTING THEIR OWN
IDEAS.
WHICH IS IS WHY I BELIEVE WE
MUST OFFER CONGRESS EVEN MORE
SAFETY BY HIDING THEIR
IDENTITIES IN THE LEGISLATIVE
PROTECTION PROGRAM.
THIS WAY, THEY WILL BE GIVEN NEW
NAMES, NEW COVER JOBS.
MITCH McCONNELL CAN NOW VOTE
HIS CONSCIENCE AS GREEK ORTHODOX
PRIEST MILOS MCCONNELOPOLOUS AND
SO CAN HARRY REID OR SHOULD I
SAY SUSHI CHEF HARUKI REIDAMOTO.
NOW AT SOME POINT FOLKS MIGHT
NOTICE ALL THESE PRIESTS AND
CHEFS HANGING AROUND THE CAPITOL
BUILDING WHICH IS WHY WE MUST
RELOCATE CONGRESS SOMEWHERE
WHERE IT CAN NEVER BE FOUND,
THOUSANDS OF MILES UNDER A
MOUNTAIN GUARDED BY RIVERS OF
MAGMA AND ARMED MOLE MEN.
OF COURSE, TO ENSURE THE
ULTIMATE IN LEGISLATIVE PRIVACY,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE ALL
VOTING BOOTHS TO HAVE REDACTED
BALLOTS.
INSTEAD OF PULL AGO LEVER, YOU
JUST THROW A DART.
NOW, I DON'T THINK AMERICANS
WOULD NOTICE A DIFFERENCE AT
THIS POINT BECAUSE IF OUR
LAWMAKERS GET TO MAKE THEIR
POLICY SUGGESTIONS IN SECRET, WE
DON'T KNOW WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR
ANYWAY.
AND THAT'S THE WORE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
