ALL THAT CHANTING, IS IT JUST
ME, OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE
CONQUERING THE KNOWN WORLD?
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
BRACE YOURSELF, FOLKS, BECAUSE
THE THINKABLE HAS HAPPENED.
REPORTS ARE THAT BRETT FAVRE HAS
RETIRED.
I KNOW.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO REMEMBER
WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE HEARD THE
NEWS.
I WAS WATCHING HIGHLIGHT TAPES
OF HIS LAST THREE RETIREMENTS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT GUY CAN REALLY CRY IN THE
CLUTCH.
ANYWAY, I JUST WANT TO SAYING,
BRETT, AS A FAN AND AS AN
AMERICAN, GOOD-BYE.
I WISH YOU A FOND FINAL
FAREWELL.
YOU WILL BE MISSED.
YOU HEAR ME?
DUE TO YOUR PERMANENT ABSENCE
FROM FOOTBALL.
BUT IF YOU DO UNRETIRE AGAIN,
LET ME BE FIRST TO SAY, I WILL
STAB YOU IN THE EYEBALL WITH A
BROKEN BROOM HANDLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
