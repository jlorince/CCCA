ENGULF BARACK OBAMA'S SECOND TERM.

BEYONC-GAZI.
WAS THERE A SECOND SINGER ON THE GRASSY KNOWLES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT.
WE HAVE A GRAPHICS PACKAGE AND EVERYTHING EVENTUALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, IF BEYONCE LIP-SYNCED AT OBAMA'S INAUGURAL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
IF SO, PLEASE WRITE IN BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHY I'M SO ANGRY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS COMES AS A HEARTBREAKING ALLEGATION BECAUSE WE WERE ALL MOVED BY MS. KNOWLES'
PERFORMANCE, NONE MORE SO THAN JOE BIDEN.
♪ ROCKETS RED GLARE ♪ ♪ THE BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR ♪
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT MAN EITHER LOVES THIS COUNTRY VERY MUCH, OR CHUCK SCHUMER JUST RIPPED ONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE LED TO BELIEVE SHE HAD DELIVERED THE MOST STIRRING RENDITION OF OUR
NATIONAL ANTHEM SINCE FRANCIS SCOTT KEY FIRST SANG IT AT AMERICA'S ORIGINAL SUPER BOWL, A
CAGE FIGHT BETWEEN A BEAR AND A CHINAMAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY.
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.
LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN.
NOW HERE'S THE TIMELINE.
LATE MONDAY, SOURCES IN THE MARINE CORPS BAND, WHO ALLEGEDLY ACCOMPANIED BEYONCE, LEAKED THE
INFORMATION THAT "BEYONCE� DECIDED SHORTLY BEFORE HER PERFORMANCE TO RELY ON THE
STUDIO VERSION RATHER THAN RISK SINGING IT LIVE ON THE CAPITOL." BECAUSE EVIDENTLY, THIS TIME, IT
WAS THE JELLY THAT WAS NOT READY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN, AFTER PRESSURE FROM WE DON'T KNOW WHERE, THE MARINE CORPS BAND SUDDENLY RELEASES
THIS STATEMENT SAYING "REGARDING MS. KNOWLES-CARTER'S VOCAL PERFORMANCE, NO ONE IN THE
MARINE BAND IS IN A POSITION TO ASSESS WHETHER IT WAS LIVE OR PRERECORDED." WHEN THOSE MARINES ARE IN THE
(bleep) WITH THE TROMBONES AND THE DRUMS, NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE SINGING'S COMING FROM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S CALLED THE FOG OF WARBLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN ACCUSATIONS START FLYING THAT THE MARINE CORPS BAND "WASN'T ACTUALLY PLAYING DURING
THE SONG." OH, SO NOW WE CAN'T TRUST THE MARINES?!
WHAT DOES THIS UNDERMINE OUR FAITH IN THE MILITARY?
DO WE HAVE A PROPER CHAIN OF COMMAND?
ARE WE REALLY EVEN AT WAR IN AFGHANISTAN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR ARE WE JUST LIP SYNCHING TO AN OLD RECORDING OF VIETNAM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
MR. PRESIDENT MR. PRESIDENT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMAND ANSWERS: -- WHAT DID BEYONCE SING, AND WHEN
DID SHE SING IT?
AND IS THAT EVEN BEYONCE?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SASHA FIERCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO FAR, FOLKS, IN RESPONSE TO THIS GROWING SCANDAL, BEYONCE HAS HAD "NO COMMENT."
THOUGH AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S "HER" NOT COMMENTING OR WHETHER SHE WAS
JUST "NOT MOVING" HER LIPS TO A PRE-RECORDED SILENCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EITHER WAY, IT'S OFFICIAL:
