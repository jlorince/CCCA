PLEASE WELCOME RADIOHEAD!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME IN THE DR. PEPPER
FLAVOR ZONE.
[LAUGHTER]
WE ARE JUST SO INCREDIBLY
EXCITED TO HAVE YOU GUYS HERE.
NOW, YOU GUYS ARE THE BIGGEST
THING EVER.
HOW DID YOU... HOW DID YOU GUYS
GET STARTED?
DID YOU WIN "IDOL" OR "THE "X"
FACTOR" OR "BRITAIN'S GOT
TALENT."
>> NO, WE'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE
BANDS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S HOW WE PICK
OUR BANDS IN THE UNITED STATES.
THAT'S HOW SOMEONE GETS BIG
HERE.
>> WE WERE IN SCHOOL TOGETHER 20
ODD YEARS AGO OR SO.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS WELL
PRESERVED.
CONGRATULATIONS.
SO THE NEW ALBUM IS CALLED "THE
KING OF LIMB."
IT IS AWESOME.
ARE YOU GUYS DOING A CHRISTMAS
ALBUM THIS YEAR?
>> WE'VE NEVER DONE A CHRISTMAS
ALBUM.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU HAUTE --
THOUGHT ABOUT IT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: I DID A CHRISTMAS
ALBUM A COUPLE YEARS BACK.
IT WON A GRAMMY.
>> DID IT?
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS GOT ANY
GRAMMYS?
>> I THINK WE HAVE, HAVEN'T WE?
>> Stephen: HOW MANY YOU GOT?
>> BEST PACKAGING.
WE WON BEST PACKAGING.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE
TOP ONES RIGHT THERE.
[APPLAUSE]
CAN I... CAN I... CAN I PICK A
BONE WITH YOU GUYS FOR A SECOND?
WOULD YOU MIND THAT?
PHIL?
WHY BRITISH?
[LAUGHTER]
I ASK BECAUSE, DON'T GET ME
WRONG, I THINK, LISTEN, THERE
ARE SOME GREAT BANDS FROM ACROSS
THE POND.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: BUT AMERICANS
COULD BE ROCKING, AND YOU'RE
TAKING AMERICAN ROCK JOBS.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, IS THE BRITISH INVASION
A GOOD THING FOR AMERICA?
WHY DO WE LIKE YOU?
>> WE DON'T KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO CLUE.
>> Stephen: NO CLUE.
DO YOU LOOK TO ANY OF THE
EARLIER INVADERS FOR LEADERSHIP,
LIKE THE STONES OR THE BEATLES
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
>> OH, YEAH.
WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE
GREETING WHEN WE GET OFF THE
AIRPLANE WITH THE CROWDS AND
[BLEEPED].
>> Stephen: YES, WELL, PERHAPS
IF YOU WERE LOVABLE MOP TOPS IN,
YOU KNOW, WITH COLLARS, BUT YOU
GUYS HAVE THIS TOTALLY INDIE
KIND OF RAGGED QUALITY TO YOU.
TOM, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
>> I'M 42.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE 42.
GROW UP, GUYS.
OKAY.
AND I MEAN THAT LOVINGLY.
I MEAN THAT LOVINGLY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CORPORATE
THING.
WHY NOT... WHY ARE YOU SO
AGAINST CORPORATIONS, MAN?
THEY'RE JOB CREATORS.
>> WHY ARE WE AGAINST
CORPORATIONS?
I DON'T THINK THEY SPREAD THE
WEALTH PARTICULARLY.
I THINK IT TENDS TO GO UP.
>> Stephen: IT TRICKLES DOWN.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: IT DOES.
WE JUST HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM
ENOUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT CORPORATIONS, LIKE TONIGHT,
WE'RE SPONSORED BY DR. PEPPER,
WHICH I READILY ADMIT...
>> WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: NEW YORK WE DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT THAT.
I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE...
[LAUGHTER]
I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED.
I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF
THAT WAS THE OFFICIAL SOFT DRINK
OF RADIOHEAD, AND IT IS NOT.
AND THAT IS ON ME, AND I
APOLOGIZE.
WOULD YOU SAY IT'S OUT OF THE
QUESTION?
>> I THINK SO.
IT TASTES LIKE THAT STUFF YOU
GET IN THE DENTIST WHEN YOU WANT
TO SWING AND A SWIZZLE DOWN.
>> Stephen: WELL, HE IS A
DOCTOR.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YOU'RE NOT CORPORATE ANYMORE.
DID YOU MAKE MORE MONEY DOING IT
BY YOURSELF OR WITH
CORPORATIONS?
>> WHAT'S THE OFFICIAL ANSWER TO
THE QUESTION?
>> Stephen: COME ON, COME ON,
YOU MAID MORE MUST BE BY
YOURSELF.
>> WE SELL LESS RECORDS BUT WE
MAKE MORE MONEY.
>> Stephen: SO FEWER PEOPLE
ARE HEARING IT, BUT YOU'RE
MAKING MORE MONEY.
[APPLAUSE]
NO, LISTEN, NO, LISTEN, THAT
MEANS THAT... SO YOU'RE
MOTIVATED BY GREED, AND THAT I
CAN RESPECTS.
[LAUGHTER]
WOULD YOU PLEASE STICK AROUND
AND DO A SONG FOR US?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A
