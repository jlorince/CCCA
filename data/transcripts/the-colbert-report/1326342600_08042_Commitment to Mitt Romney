[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT," EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
MORE BEAUTIFUL IF IT HAD BEEN
SUNG BY A HALF-WORTH BARD.
TOUGH LIFE, THOSE HALF-WORTH
BARDS.
NATION, UNLESS YOU LIVE IN A
CAVE, I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THAT
YESTERDAY'S NEW HAMPSHIRE
PRIMARY WAS WON BY MITT ROMNEY.
AND IF YOU DO LIVE IN A CAVE,
I'M GUESSING YOU VOTED FOR RON
PAUL.
THE MAN CAME IN A STRONG SECOND.
NOW, FORMER UTAH GOVERNOR AND
OBAMA AMBASSADOR TO CHINA JON
HUNTSMAN HAD BET EVERYTHING ON
NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT HE CAME IN
THIRD AT 17%.
LAST NIGHT HE RALLIED THE
TROOPS.
>> I'D SAY THIRD PLACE IS A
TICKET TO RIDE, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
>> Stephen: YES, HE'S GOT A
TICKET TO RIDE, AND WE DON'T
CARE.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY EVERYBODY
KNOWS WHAT THE RESULTS OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE MEAN.
>> ROMNEY IS NOW CLEARLY THE
FAVORITE TO WIN THE NOMINATION.
>> I THINK IT'S SET IN STONE.
IT IS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, PEOPLE
ARE PROBABLY GOING TO END UP
GOING TO ROMNEY.
>> IF HE HAS IN HIS MIND WRAPPED
UP THE NOMINATION AND HE'S OFF
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
>> THIS GUY IS THE INEVITABLE
NOMINEE.
>> HE'S INEVITABLE.
>> I GUESS HE WAS INEVITABLE
AFTER ALL.
>> Stephen: YES, NOW THAT ROMNEY
HAS WON A NON-BINDING CAUCUS BY
EIGHT VOTES AND A PLURALITY OF
THE VOTE IN ONE OF THE SMALLEST
PRIMARIES IN THE NATION, HE IS A
JUGGERNAUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS, I'M
STARTING TO SEE IT:
PRESIDENT ROMNEY.
IT COULD WORK.
SURE, HE'S NOT THE WARMEST
CANDIDATE OR THE MOST
CONSERVATIVE, BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE'S THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND LET'S BE HONEST, I'VE SEEN
THIS COMING FOR A LONG TIME.
IT'S NOT FIREWORKS, BUT, YOU
KNOW, I SHOULD JUST GROW UP AND
ACCEPT IT.
IT'S LIKE AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
I SHOULD THINK OF MYSELF NOT AS
A VOTER, BUT AS A 12-YEAR-OLD
INDONESIAN GIRL PROMISED TO THE
RICH OLD MAN FROM A NEARBY
VILLAGE.
YOU KNOW...
[LAUGHTER]
THEY LOOK HAPPY.
THOUGH HE MAY SMELL OF WINE AND
FISH, HE IS A SUCCESSFUL MAN.
I SHALL SELL HIS NETS.
OH, MITT, OH, MITT, WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO WITH YOU?
I CANNOT TELL IF I'M MISSING
SOMETHING OR I'M JUST AFRAID TO
LET MYSELF BE HAPPY.
I'M SO CONFUSED.
YOU KNOW, IF THIS WERE A
ROMANTIC COMEDY, I'D GET ADVICE
FROM MY PERCEPTIVE GAY BEST
FRIEND.
>> STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: ANDY!
HOW ARE YOU?
ANDY COHEN, EVERYBODY.
FROM BRAVO.
>> STEPHEN.
HOW ARE YOU?
I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD.
>> Stephen: I'M FAT.
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.
NO, NO YOU'RE NOT.
>> Stephen: YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.
ANYWAY, HERE'S THE THING.
>> TELL ME.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THIS GUY MITT, WHO IS COMING ON
TO ME SO HARD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WAIT, MITT, IS THAT THIS BIG
SHOT PRIVATE EQUITY GUY?
>> Stephen: YEAH, I MEAN, HE'S
STABLE AND HE'S GOT GREAT HAIR.
>> HOW IS HE, YOU KNOW, BEHIND
THE PODIUM?
>>>> Stephen: ACTUALLY, HE'S A
IT WILL BORING.
>> KIND OF STIFF?
>> Stephen: YEAH, AND NOT IN A
GOOD WAY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> Stephen: LOOK.
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.
>> Stephen: SERIOUSLY, ANDY.
EVERYONE SAYS HE'S THE BEST I
CAN DO, BUT HE'S GOOD, NO GREAT.
>> SOUNDS LIKE HALF MY ORGASMS.
DO YOU WANT MY ADVICE?
>> Stephen: YES.
>> WHEN YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW.
>> THAT WAITER JUST EARNED
HIMSELF A TIP.
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
ANDY, I THINK HE DESERVES MORE
THAN JUST A TIP.
>> YOU ARE SO, SO BAD.
>> Stephen: I AM.
>> STEPHEN, THAT INCREDIBLY
HANDSOME WAITER IS RIGHT.
FOLLOW YOUR HEART.
RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD BE
PASSIONATE, LIKE A HONEY MOON
SALAD -- LETTUCE ALONE, NO
DRESSING.
>> Stephen: I NEVER THOUGHT OF
POLITICS IN TERMS OF SALAD
BEFORE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT SUDDENLY I REALIZED, ANDY
WAS RIGHT.
I WANTED ARUGULA AND ENDIVE, BUT
I WAS GETTING ICEBERG.
WOULD I BA SAL MILK REGRET IT?
>> STEPHEN YOU'RE, MORE THAN THE
SALAD.
YOU'RE THE MAIN COURSE.
ANY CANDIDATE WOULD BE LUCKY TO
ORDER YOU.
BY THE WAY, IT'S PRONOUNCE
ON-DEEV.
>> Stephen: WHAT A BITCH.
[LAUGHTER]
THANKS, ANDY.
YOU'RE THE BEST.
>> REMEMBER, FOLLOW YOUR HEART,
AND THANKS FOR LUNCH.
>> Stephen: ANDY COHEN,
EVERYBODY.
