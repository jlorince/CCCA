>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
NATION, NATION, I HAVE SAIDIT BEFORE, YOU KNOW IT-- FOLKS,
OPINIONS ARE LIKE A-HOLES,IN THAT MINE IS THE BEST.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAGOF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FIRST UP, FOLKS, SOME SCARY
NEWS OUT OF POLAND WHERE APRIEST CLAIMS TO BE
RECEIVING TEXT MESSAGES FROMTHE DEVIL AFTER PERFORMING
AN EXORCISM ON A POLISH GIRLCAUSING SATAN TO POSSESS HER
MOBILE PHONE.
I GOT TO SAY SATAN USINGCELL PHONES DOES MAKE SENSE,
THOUGH SATAN'S CONTRACTS ARESLIGHTLY EASIER TO GET OUT
OF.
I THINK WE'VE ALL WOKEN UPAFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING
AND FOUND OUR PHONE SENTSOME TEXTS THAT COULD ONLY
BE THE WORK OF THE PRINCE OFDARKNESS.
AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HEGOT PHOTOS OF MY GROIN,
CHARLENE.
SO I GOT TO GIVE A RELUCTANTWAG OF MY FINGER TO
BEELZEBUB FOR PHONING THISONE IN, COME ON YOU ARE THE
PRINCE OF LIE, THEINCARNATIONS OF ALL EVIL, THE
SULTAN OF SWAT.
AND THIS IS THE BEST YOU CANDO?
I KNOW SLOTH IS A DEADLY SINBUT POSSESSING A CELL PHONE
IS JUST DAMN LAZY.
IS POSSESSING SOMEONEFACE-TO-FACE JUST TOO MUCH
EFFORT FOR TODAY'SMILLENNIAL DEMONS?
WHATEVER HAPPENED IT TO ALITTLE HUMAN DEVIL CONTACT.
IN MY DAY THIS IS WHATPOSSESSION WAS.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,SEND AN EMOJI FOR
PROJECTILE VOMIT?
AND THEN TEXT ROFTMHO FORROLLING ON THE FLOOR
TWISTING MY HEAD OFF?
BUT FOR ANYONE OUT THERE WHOSUSPECTS THEIR SMART PHONE
MIGHT BE IN NEED OF TEXT-ORCISM,DO NOT TAKE IT TO THE GENIUS
BAR.
YOU WILL BE THERE FOR ANETERNITY.
(LAUGHTER)STAY TUNED FOR MORE OF THE
TIP WAG POWER HOUR COMING UPRIGHT AFTER THIS SENTENCE.
NEXT UP ON TIP WAG EVERYONEKNOWS NASA HAS SEEN BETTER
DAYS.
THE BUDGETS WERE BIGGER, THEGOALS WERE HIGHER, EVERYONE
LOOKED LIKE ED HARRIS.
NOW OUR SPACE PROGRAM ISGUTTED.
BUT LIKE THE CREW OF APOLLO13 I HAVE NEVER LOST HOPE
AND I STORE MY URINE INBAGS.
WELL, OVER THE WEEKEND,FOLKS, AMERICA FINALLY GOT
SOME GOOD NASA NEWS.
>> NASA'S SPACE ROVER ONMARS MAKING SOME NEWS OF ITS
OWN ON SUNDAY DRIVING 25MILES, SETTING A NEW RECORD
FOR THE LONGEST OFF-EARTHDRIVING DISTANCE SINCE IT
ARRIVED IN MARS IN 2004.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS WHY I'MGIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO
NASA FOR THEIR FEAT OF OFFPLANET ROAD OFF-ROADING.
THAT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT,FOLKS.
BECAUSE AS THE ROVER'SPROJECT MANAGER SAID,
OPPORTUNITY WAS ONLYINTENDED TO DRIVE ABOUT ONE
KILOMETER.
SO BASICALLY ABOUT AS MUCHAS A CHEVY COBALT.
BUT WHAT REALLY HAS MEEXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW
RECORD IS THE RECORD ITBROKE WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY
THE SOVIET UNION'S REMOTECONTROLLED LUNOKHOD 2 ROVER
WHICH COVERED 24.2 MILES ONTHE MOON BACK IN 1973.
WHICH EXPLAINS WHYOPPORTUNITY USED ITS 25
MILES OF TIRE TRACKS TOSPELL OUT SUCK IT, VLAD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
