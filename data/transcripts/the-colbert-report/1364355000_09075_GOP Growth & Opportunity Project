[CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK R- THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, PLEASE THANK YOU.
HEROS.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS -- PLEASE WE'VE GOT A THING TO DO HERE.
I DON'T GROW TIRED OF IT EITHER.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, I DONT NEED TO TELL YOU THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN CRISIS.
AND EVER SINCE THEY LOST THE ELECTION, THE GOP HAS BEEN FLAILING AROUND FOR ANSWERS.
AND NO ONE HAS FLAILED HARDER THAN REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND UNSOLVED
JUMBLE PUZZLE, REINCE PRIEBUS.
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY, THE SOLUTION TO THAT JUMBLE?
CRISP BEE URINE.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK IT UP.
LOOK IT UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION, MR. URINE CONVENED A PANEL OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS CALLED THE
"GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY PROJECT" TO STUDY WHY THEY LOST.
OR AS HE PUT IT:
>> YOU'VE GOT TO DO A FULL AUTOPSY.
>> Stephen: YES, A FULL AUTOPSY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S THE NATURAL THING TO DO WHEN YOU'VE GOT CANDIDATES THIS COLD AND STIFF.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THE PANEL RELEASED ITS AUTOPSY LAST WEEK, AND GOOD NEWS, THERE ARE MULTIPLE CAUSES
OF DEATH!
[LAUGHTER]
>> OUR MESSAGE WAS WEAK.
OUR GROUND GAME WAS INSUFFICIENT.
WE WEREN'T INCLUSIVE.
FOCUS GROUPS DESCRIBED OUR PARTY AS "NARROW MINDED," "OUT Of TOUCH," AND "STUFFY OLD MEN."
I'M ONLY 41 BY THE WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YEAH, HE'S ONLY 41!
HE'S A STUFFY MIDDLE-AGED MAN!
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHILE THE AUTOPSY SAYS THAT REPUBLICANS NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF REACHING OUT TO BLACK
PEOPLE, BROWN PEOPLE, AND WOMEN PEOPLE, NO GROUP IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THE GOP'S FUTURE
SUCCESS THAN YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE.
AS THE REPORT LAMENTS MITT ROMNEY LOST VOTERS YOUNGER THAN 30 BY FIVE MILLION VOTES.
FIVE MILLION!
WHAT WERE MY FELLOW UNDER 30-YEAR-OLDS THINKING?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, HOLD ON TO YOUR BACKWARD HATS, YOUNG JEE-ZEES, BECAUSE
[LAUGHTER]
THE AUTOPSY SAYS THAT TO REACH THE KIDS, THE GOP SHOULD ESTABLISH A REPUBLICAN CELEBRITY
TASK FORCE, AN ELITE SQUAD OF CONSERVATIVE SUPERSTARS READY TO DEPLOY AS SOON AS WE ACTIVATE
THE CELEBRITY TASK FORCE SIGNAL.
[LAUGHTER]
[SIREN]
>> GOP CELEBRITY TASK FORCE ASSEMBLE!
JON VOIGHT!
VICTORIA JACKSON!
TOM SELLECK!
KELSEY GRAMMER!
CLIFF CLAVEN!
LADY FROM NORTHERN EXPOSURE!
[LAUGHTER]
AT LEAST ONE BALDWIN!
[LAUGHTER]
THIS GUY, FROM THAT THING!
THE KIDS WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THEY KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, ON THE SLIM CHANCE THIS DOESN'T SEAL THE YOUTH VOTE, THE REPUBLICAN AUTOPSY ALSO SAYS,
"REPUBLICAN LEADERS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN AND ACTIVELY PREPARE FOR INTERVIEWS WITH "THE
DAILY SHOW" AND "THE COLBERT REPORT."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHOO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU HEAR THAT, REPUBLICANS?
NOW, I DONT KNOW WHY A POLITICIAN WOULD WANT TO GO ON WITH GRANDPA OVER HERE, BUT IF
YOU COME ON MY SHOW, YOU WILL REACH THE YOUTH!
OR AS I CALL IT, "YOU'LL GET YOUTH-ANIZED."
[ LAUGHTER ]
LISTEN TO YOUR PRIEBUS!
THIS STUDIO IS A SAFE ZONE, MI CASA ES SU CASA-- IS SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ME SAY.
[LAUGHTER]
