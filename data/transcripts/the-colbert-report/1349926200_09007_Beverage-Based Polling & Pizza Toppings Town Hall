>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  AWFULLY NICE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO
HAVE YOU WITH US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS KIND
OF THAT TIME OF YEAR TO ASK THE
QUESTION IS THIS NOT--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
, PLEASE, PLEASE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE COULD
POWER MY WHOLE VILLAGE IF WE
COULD JUST PUT SOME JUMPER
CABLES ON YOUR NIPPLES RIGHT NOW
AND IT'S CHILLY ENOUGH TO DO SO
IN THIS ROOM.
FOLKS, ISN'T THIS A GREAT
CAMPAIGN?
♪ EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROMNEY
♪ ♪
THE LATEST POLLS HAVE ROMNEY
NECK AND NECK WITH OBAMA.
FOLKS, THIS RACE IS AS TIGHT AS
MITT'S SMILE WHEN HE MEETS A
POOR PERSON.
( LAUGHTER )
( LAUGHTER )
UNFORTUNATELY, UNFORTUNATELY,
FOLKS, THERE'S STILL ONE POLL
OUT THERE THAT GIVES PAUM A
CHANCE.
>> 7-ELEVEN STORES ARE GIVING
VOICE TO THE PEOPLE BY OFFERING
A CHOICE OF COFFEE CUBS IN OBAMA
BLUE OR ROMNEY RED.
THE COMPANY SAYS THE VOTES
PEOPLE CAST NATIONALLY CAN BE
USED AS VALUABLE POLLING DATA.
>> Stephen:  YES.
IN 7-ELEVEN'S CUP HOLE, RIGHT
NOW, OBAMA IS UP BY 20 POINTS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NO, FOLKS, WAIT A SECOND.
ARE WE SURE THEY'RE NOT USING
FOUR--YEAR-OLD DATA?
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE
USING FOUR-YEAR-OLD HOT DOGS.
WHAT IS TERRIFYING ABOUT THIS IS
THE 7-ELEVEN CUP POLL IS
UNCHARACTERLY ACCURATE.
>> DID YOU KNOW THIS PROMOTION
ACTUALLY LINED UP PERFECTLY WITH
THE RESULTS OF A 2004 AND 2008
ELECTIONS?
>> Stephen:  AND WHO CAN
FORGET IN 2010 WHEN THEY
ACCURATELY PREDICTED THE
ELECTION OF SENATOR SHREK?
( LAUGHTER )
NATION, I CALL BIAS ON 7-ELEVEN.
THEIR ENTIRE POLL HAS A MARGIN
OF ERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS
MORMONS CAN'T DRINK COFFEE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GOING
ON HERE?
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON
HERE, FOLKS?
VOTER FRAUD.
OH, YEAH.
WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE DRINK
7-ELEVEN COFFEE?
FOLKS, WE MUST REQUIRE VOTER
I.D. BEFORE ANYONE CAN BUY A CUP
OF JOE.
I AM SURE 7-ELEVEN WILL BE JUST
AS RIGOROUS ABOUT CHECKING
I.D. FOR CUPS AS THEY ARE FOR
BEER AND CIGARETTES.
BUT ULTIMATELY, BEVERAGE-BASED
POLLING, I BELIEVE, DEMEANS OUR
POLITICAL PROCESS.
THANKFULLY, NEXT WEEK, THERE'S
ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.
IT'S A TOWN HALL FORMAT WHICH
MEANS AVERAGE CITIZENS WILL HAVE
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME CHANCE TO
ASK THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE
WORLD ABOUT THE MOST VITAL
ISSUES FACING OUR NATION.
OR ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
( LAUGHTER )
>> PIZZA HUT IS GOING TO BE
GIVING FREE PIZZA FOR LIFE TO
ANY CUSTOMER WHO ASKS PRESIDENT
OBAMA OR MITT ROMNEY IF THEY
PREFER SAUSAGE OR PEPPERONI
PIZZA AT THE UPCOMING DEBATE.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT.
WHOEVER USES THEIR BRIEF TIME AT
THE NATIONAL MIC TO ASK THE
CANDIDATES, SAUSAGE OR
PEPPERONI, WILL RECEIVE FREE
PITA HUT PIZZA FOR LIFE.
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S
MEANT TO BE A REWARD.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BECAUSE IT'S DELICIOUS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I LOVE IT.
I EAT IT.
I EAT IT ALL THE TIME.
AND SO SHOULD YOU.
NOW, FOLKS THEY SAY FOR LIFE,
BUT THE QUESTIONER WILL ACTUALLY
RECEIVE THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE
FREE PIZZA PER WEEK FOR 30
YEARS.
WHICH I THINK IS PITA HUT'S WAY
OF SAYING IF YOU EAT ONE OF
THEIR PIZZAS EVERY WEEK, YOU
WILL DIE IN 30 YEARS.
( APPLAUSE )
SO JUST WHAT MOTIVATED-- JUST
WHAT MOTIVATED PIZZA HUT TO GET
OFF THE COUCH AND GET INVOLVED
IN OUR POLITICAL PROCESS?
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY'S
C.M.O., WHICH I HOPE STANDS FOR
CHIEF MOZZARELLA OFFICER, WE
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT
OF SERIOUS ISSUES TO BE DEBATED,
BUT WE ALSO KNOW A LOT LESS
SERIOUS BUT NO-LESS-IMPORTANT
ONES ARE BEING DISCUSSED EVERY
NIGHT INSIDE HOUSES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
TRUE.
ISSUES LIKE WHAT THE ( BLEEP )
HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICAN
DEMOCRACY?
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS, I LOVE THIS.
WHAT COULD BE MORE AMERICAN THAN
USING OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS FOR
PRODUCT PLACEMENT?
I MEAN, MITT
