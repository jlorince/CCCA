( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
NEW BOOK ABOUT RONALD REAGAN.
I'LL HAVE MY ASSISTANT READ IT
AND LET THE INFORMATION TRICKLE
DOWN TO ME.
PLEASE WELCOME RON REAGAN JR.!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, RON!
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> BEFORE YOU GO ANY FATHER I
JUST HAVE TO CORRECT YOU
BRIEFLY.
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A JUNIOR.
>> YOU'RE NOT A JUNIOR.
>> WE HAVE DIFFERENT MIDDLE
NAMES.
>> Stephen:  WHAT'S YOUR
MIDDLE NAME?
>> PRESCOTT AND HE'S A WILLIAMS.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS
INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WITH YOUR
FATHER.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
>> YES, I DID.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE A LIBERAL.
>> I AM.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE A LIBERAL.
>> I AM
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  DON'T WORRY,
DON'T APPLAUD BEFORE I NAIL HIM
( LAUGHTER )
NOW HOW CAN YOU-- BUT YOU'RE
RONALD REAGAN'S SON!
>> I KNOW.
>> Stephen:  HOW CAN YOU LIVE
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD AND GROW UP
TO BE AN ATHEIST, YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?
>> IT WAS PROBABLY THE IFNG BUS
PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF MY CRIB
THAT BREATHED LIBERALISM AND
EITHISM INTO MY NOSTRILS WHEN I
WAS A BABY.
>> Stephen:  WHO WAS THAT,
MONDALE?
>> HE HAD KIND OF A SILVER
HAIRCUT.
>> Stephen:  LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR NEW BOOK, "MY FATHER AT
100, A MEMOIR."
SO YOUR FATHER, HIS BIRTHDAY
IS--
>> FEBRUARY 6.
>> Stephen:  SO THIS FEBRUARY
6 HE WILL HAVE BEEN 100 YEARS
OLD.
DID YOU AND YOUR FATHER FIGHT
OVER POLITICS AROUND THE KITCHEN
TABLE?
YES, OR AROUND THE DINING ROOM
TABLE.
WE USUALLY DINED A LITTLE MORE
FORMALLY THAN THE KITCHEN TABLE,
BUT WHEREVER WE WERE WE WOULD
ARGUE ABOUT THINGS-- THE VIETNAM
WAR, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, THAT
SORT OF THING.
BUT WE STAYED FRIENDS.
IN THOSE DAYS, YOU SEE, YOU IN
THOSE DAYS, YOU SEE, YOU COULD
DISAGREE WITH A REPUBLICAN AND
NOT BE VILIFIED AS A TERRORIST,
PAL.
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
>> Stephen:  WOULD YOUR FATHER
BE NOMINATED TODAY FOR
PRESIDENT?
>> I'M PROBABLY NOT THE BEST
PERSON TO ASK ABOUT THAT.
NEWT GINGRICH OR SOMEBODY LIKE
THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS
BUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID HE
WOULD BE TOO LIBERAL TODAY TO BE
NOMINATED AS A REPUBLICAN.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, THAT LEADS
ME TO A VERY IMPORTANT
QUESTION-- WHAT ARE THE THINGS
THAT I SHOULD FORGET ABOUT YOUR
FATHER SO I CAN KEEP THE IMAGE
OF HIM IN MY HEAD THE WAY I
WANT.
BECAUSE, NIXON, I CONVENIENTLY
FORGET HE STARTED THE E.P.A. AND
GAVE THE VOTE TO 18-YEAR-OLDS
AND OPENED UP CHINA.
>> AND HE WAS AN ANTI-SEMMITE.
>> Stephen:  NO THAT ACTUALLY
FIT THE MOLD.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR FATHER
THEY SHOULD FORGET?
>> WELL, PROBABLY RAISING TAXES.
>> Stephen:  NEVER HAPPENED.
>> YEAH, DIDN'T HAPPEN.
>> Stephen:  DIDN'T HAPPEN.
>> AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.
>> Stephen:  YOU SHUT YOUR
MOUTH.
HE DID NOT DO IT.
HE DID NOT DO IT.
>> NO, NO LA-LA-LA-LA.
WELL, AND ONE OF THE MOST
LIBERAL ABORTION LAWS IN THE
NATION IN CALIFORNIA WHEN HE WAS
GOVERNOR EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
ANTICHOICE.
>> Stephen:  THAT DOESN'T
COUNT.
STATES DON'T COUNT BECAUSE
ANYTHING YOU GODO AS A GOVERNOR
IS A MULLIGAN.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER.
>> Stephen:  ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'VE GOTTEN SOME ATTENTION AND
PROBABLY TAKEN SOME HEAT FOR
SAYING YOU SUSPECT YOUR FATHER
SHOWED SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S WHEN
HE WAS STILL PRESIDENT.
>> THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I
SAID.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DID YOU
EXACTLY SAY?
>> I EXACTLY SAID THEY CAN
DEDUCE, GIVEN WHAT WE BEEN
ALZHEIMER'S NOW, THAT IT'S A
PROCESS THAT EXTENDS FOR A LONG
TIME BEFORE SYMPTOMS ARISE, IT
IS LIKELY THAT THE DISEASE WAS
PRESENT WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT.
I DO SAY SPECIFICALLY I DIDN'T
SEE ANY SIGNS OF DEMENTIA WHEN
HE WAS PRESIDENT, BUT, AGAIN,
IT'S KIND OF A MEDICAL REALITY
--
>> Stephen:  DID YOU SEE
ANYTHING WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT
THAT YOU SAID TO YOURSELF, HUH,
NOW IN RETROSPECT THAT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN SIGN SOMESIGN OF IT?
>> YEAH, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
IT WOULD BE LIKE HE WAS WATCHING
TV AND THE FOCUS SOFTENED A
LITTLE AND SHARPENED BACK UP AND
I THOUGHT I WONDER WHAT THAT
WAS.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
I JUST WORRIED ABOUT HIM ALL THE
TIME BECAUSE HE WAS MY FATHER
AND I LOVED HIM AND HE WAS IN A
TOUGH, TENSE JOB, AND I WORRIED
ABOUT HIM.
>> Stephen:  IN WHAT WAYS--
WE'RE NOT ON THE AIR THE WEEK OF
FEBRUARY 6 THAT HIS BIRTHDAY IS
ON AND MORE IS THE PITY
OTHERWISE WE COULD HAVE OUR
CELEBRATION BROADCAST INSTEAD OF
DOING IT PRIVATELY
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT IS IT-- HOW WOULD YOU SAY
THAT AVERAGE AMERICANS SHOULD
CELEBRATE YOUR FATHER'S
100th BIRTHDAY?
WHAT WOULD BE A FITTING WAY TO
DO THAT?
>> WELL, I THINK PROBABLY BY
UYING "MY FATHER AT 100."B
>> Stephen:  ENGAGING IN A
CAPITALIST ENTERPRISE MIGHT BE
THE BEST THING TO DO.
LET THE FREE MARKET HONOR RONALD
REAGAN.
>> INDEED.
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU SO
MUCH, RON.
