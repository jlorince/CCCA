>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOR ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA,
NATION, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU
WATCH THE NEWS AS CLOSELY AS I
DO, YOU KNOW THE SEQUESTER
BUDGET CUTS ARE HERE.
THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE SEEN SMALLER
BENEFIT CHECKS, SOME CANCER
PATIENTS HAVE GONE WITHOUT
TREATMENT, AND LINES AT NEW
YORK'S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT NOW
START AT CHICAGO'S O'HARE.
TOUGH MEDICINE.
BUT CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME KNOW
THAT IN A BUDGET CRISIS,
EVERYTHING NONESSENTIAL HAS TO
GO -- WHETHER IT'S FOOD FOR KIDS
WHO AREN'T MINE OR SOME OTHER
STUFF FOR PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT
GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY ON THAT
ARE WORTH -- STAY WITH ME --
SPENDING MONEY -- STAY WITH
ME -- ON.
AND, AS USUAL, THOSE THINGS ARE
TANKS.
THEY ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT WE
NEED THEM EVEN WHEN WE DON'T
NEED THEM.
>> CONGRESS APPROPRIATED $255
MILLION TO UPGRADE THE ARMY'S M1
ABRAMS TANK BUT HERE'S THE
THING.
THE PENTAGON WANTS TO HALT
PRODUCTION ON THESE TANKS.
>> MILITARY GENERALS SAY WE
DON'T NEED THAT TANK OR THAT
BOMBER.
CONGRESS SAYS YEAH YOU DO.
>> LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH PARTIES
HAVE DEVOTED THE TAX PAYER MONEY
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS ON
IMPROVING THE ABRAMS TANK BUT
GENERAL RAY ODIERNO, THE ARMY'S
CHIEF OF STAFF, SAID IF HE HAD A
CHOICE HE'D USE THE MONEY IN A
DIFFERENT WAY.
>> Stephen: I AM SHOCKED TO HEAR
THAT FROM GENERAL ODIERNO WHO I
BELIEVE IS PART TANK ON HIS
FATHER'S SIDE.
WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE
TANKS ARE GOING TO ROLL AND IT'S
ALL TANKS... (LAUGHING) -- TO...
THANK YOU.
AND ALL IT'S "TANKS" TO OHIO'S
SENATOR ROB PORTMAN AND
CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN.
IT'S A BRAVE STANCE FOR THESE
FISCAL CONSERVATIVES.
CONGRESSMAN JORDAN WHO
REPRESENTS LIMA OHIO WHERE THE
TANKS ARE MANUFACTURED DEFENDED
THE COST SAYING, QUOTE, THE ONE
AREA WHERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
SPEND TAX PAYER MONEY IS IN
DEFENSE OF THE COUNTRY.
THE OTHER AREA, YOU KNOW, HIS
DISTRICT.
AND IF THE ARMY DOESN'T REALLY
WANT THEM, THAT'S FINE.
THESE TWO HAVE VOTED TO CUT
FUNDING TO ALL KINDS OF SERVICES
AND THE TANKS CAN HELP FILL THE
GAPS.
FOR INSTANCE, MEALS ON WHEELS
GOT HIT BY THE SEQUESTER.
LET'S REPLACE IT WITH BREADS ON
TREADS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I MEAN, ONE OF THESE TANKS CAN
BARRAGE THE ELDERLY WITH STICKY
BUNS FROM THREE MILES AWAY.
AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY
FOR CANCER PATIENTS' MEDICINE
ANYMORE, BUT WE CAN OFFER THEM
ONE LAST BAD-ASS DAY OF
ADVENTURE.
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE SOCIAL
SERVICES.
I MEAN IN THE MILITARY THE BLUE
ANGELS' BUDGET HAS BEEN SPLASHED
BUT IT WILL BE JUST AS EXCITING
TO WATCH THE GRAY TANKLES.
OH, THEY'RE MAKING ANOTHER
SQUARE.
THE BEST PART IS WE WON'T HAVE
TO SHUT DOWN THE TANK PLANT IN
LIMA, OHIO.
AND THAT WILL SAVE JOBS.
WELL, TWO OF
