BOOT?
IN ORDER TO CELEBRATE THEINDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE SEATTLE
AREA, THE SCHOOL HAS UNANIMOUSLYVOTED TO HAVE THE SCHOOL OBSERVE
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DAY EVENTHOUGH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
WILL OBSERVE COLUMBUS DAY
>> Stephen: YES, SEATTLE ISREPLACING COLUMBUS DAY WITH
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY.
WHY?
THEY DIDN'T DISCOVER AMERICA.
AND IT WAS RIGHT UNDER THEIRFEET THE WHOLE TIME.
HOW LAZY DO YOU HAVE TO BE TONOT EVEN LOOK DOWN?
AND THEY CLAIM-- THEY CLAIM IT'SABOUT FIGHTING RACISM, BUT TELL
THEM WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HEREPETER JOHNSON JR.?
>> IT'S A SOCIAL AND POLITICALSTATEMENT THAT SAYS THAT
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WAS AVIOLATOR OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.
>> IT'S A SLAP.
>> IT'S AN ATTACK ON COLUMBUSDAY.

DAY.
( LAUGHTER )OR TO PUT IT IN A WAY THAT FIT
MY PREEXISTING GRAPHIC, IT'SCOLUMBUS DAY UNDER ATTACK.
>> MAMA MIA.
>> JESUS AND COLUMBUS SIDE BYSIDE, JUST LIKE THEY WERE ON THE
"NINA" AND "PINTA."
, OF COURSE, ST. MARY ON ON THE"SANTA MARIA."
NATION, I TAKE THIS ASSAULT ONCOLUMBUS PERSONALLY.
AS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT IIDENTIFY WITH AN ITALIAN
EXPLORER EMPLOYED BY SPAIN.
THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OFIMMIGRANT.
I WOULD BE FINE WITH THE BORDERJUMPERS IF THEY WERE JUST TRYING
TO FIND SPICE ROUTES TO ASIA.
AND NOW SEATTLE WANTS ME TO FEELGUILTY JUST BECAUSE COLUMBUS'
ARRIVAL USHERED IN CENTURIES OFSUBJUGATION AND GENOCIDE.
IT'S OVER.
WE'RE MAKING AMENDS.
JUST THIS WEEKEND WE'RE SENDINGREBA TO MOHEGAN SUN.
WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT?
WORST OF ALL, IF THIS CATCHESON, WE STAND TO LOSE ALL OF OUR
MOST CHERISHED COLUMBUS DAYTRADITIONS.
IT ALL STARTS BRIGHT BRIGHT ANDEARLY ON COLUMBUS DAY MORNING
WHEN THE KIDS RUSH DOWNSTAIRS INTHEIR P.J'S TO  SAY, "WE'RE OFF
FROM SCHOOL!
WHY DOES DAD HAVE TO WORK?
THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT."
NO, IT DOESN'T.
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT AT ALL,KIDS.
THEN WE GO TO THE PARADE AND EATOUR WAY THROUGH SAUSEECH.
... I THINK RIGHT NOW, ALL OF USFEEL LIKE THAT ITALIAN GUY WHO
PLAYED THAT INDIAN GUY IN THOSEPOLLUTION COMMERCIALS.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
DAY BREAKS, YOU STAY BRAVE, IRONEYES.
WE MAY FORGIVE, BUT WE MUSTNEVER FUGHET ABOUT IT.
