COVER IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NATION, I'M GOING TO VANCOUVER
TO COVER THE WINTER GAMES NEXT
MONTH, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER
LITTLE NEWS OUTFIT OUT THERE
GOING.
NBC.
THEY'VE RUN INTO A FEW HURDLES,
WHICH IS SURPRISING SINCE WINTER
SPORTS DON'T HAVE HURDLES.
>> FOR ALL THE TKPWHREULTS AND
GLAM OF THE 2010 WINTER GAMES
THEY MAY NOT END UP MAKING MONEY
FOR NBC.
IN FACT, THE NETWORK MAY LOSE AS
MUCH AS $200 MILLION ON THE
GAMES.
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT NBC IS
SAVING MONEY ON THE OLYMPIC
TORCH BY JUST SETTING FIRE TO
CONAN O'BRIEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT COULD BE HIS HAIR, IT'S
HARD TO TELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IN FACT, NBC SPORTS CHAIRMAN
DICK EBERSOL IS MY GUEST
TONIGHT.
WHEN I WAS BACK STAGE, I'M
PRETTY SURE I SAW HIM SLIP A
ROLL OF TOILET PAPER INTO HIS
BRIEFCASE.
CLEARLY THEY NEED HELP.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M CALLING
ON YOU, THE NATION, TO SPONSOR A
NEW CHARITY, NBC.
OUR FUND-RAISING GOAL IS $200
MILLION.
LOG ON TO COLBERTNATION.COM NOW
TO DO YOUR PART.
IF WE GET TO $200 MILLION, I'M
CONFIDENT BOB COSTAS WILL BE
HOLDING INTERVIEWS WITH THE
COLBERT NATION LOGO TATTOOED ON
HIS FOREHEAD.
OR IF WE RAISE A LITTLE BIT
MORE, MAYBE A TRAMP STAMP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FOLKS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHECK THAT
OUT WHEN I'M IN VANCOUVER.
I'M NOT GOING JUST TO SAVE NBC.
NO, I'M DETERMINED TO GO AS PART
OF AMERICA'S TEAM.
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL
INSTALLMENT OF MY EXCLUSIVE
PRE-OLYMPIC COVERAGE, STEPHEN
COLBERT'S SKATE EXPECTATIONS:
KICK ICE AND TAKING DONATIONS ON
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE DOWN THE ICY
PATH THROUGH THE FROZEN ROADS UP
TO VANCOUVER.
0-10.
BROUGHT TO YOU BY DR. PEPPER, IT
WILL GET YOU LAID.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUDWEISER, TASTE THE CLYBESDALES
>> STEPHEN: ON YESTERDAY'S
SHOW.
SHANI DAVIS ACCEPTED HIS
CHALLENGE TO A RACE.
THE WINNER GETS THE LAST
POSITION ON THE U.S. SPEED
SKATER TEAM.
LAST NIGHT STEP ONE, I LEARNED
HOW TO SKATE.
WHEN WE RETURN, I RACE THE
FASTEST SKATER IN THE WORLD IN
SHANI VERSUS STEPHEN, FACEOFF ON
ICE, BUT NOT HOCKEY KIND.
YOU KNOW, WE'LL COME U
