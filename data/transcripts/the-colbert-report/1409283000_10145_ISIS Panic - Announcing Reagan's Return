NATION, I, TOO, CAN IMAGINE OURWAY TO A BETTER WORLD  BECAUSE,
I, LIKE NEWT GINGRICH, BELIEVEWE CAN DEFEAT ISIS WITH THE
POWER OF MAKE-BELIEVE.
REMEMBER, IN 1938, THE RADIOBROADCAST OF WAR OF THE WORLDS
MANAGED TO CONVINCE THOUSANDS OFAMERICANS THAT ALIENS WERE
ATTACKING.
WE CAN DO THE SAME THING TO ISISAND CONVINCE THEM THAT REAGAN IS
BACK IN CHARGE.
(LIKE OLD TIMEY ANNOUNCER...)WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST OF
THE COLBERT REPORT TO BRING YOUA SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL RADIO NEWS.
AT TEN MINUTES AFTER 11:00,EASTERN TIME, A HUGE FLAMING
OBJECT FELL ON A FARM IN THENEIGHBORHOOD OF GROVERS MILL,
NEW JERSEY.
OBSERVERS REPORTED THAT IT WAS,IN FACT, RONALD REAGAN.
PRESIDENT REAGAN IMMEDIATELYMOUNTED A NEARBY STALLION AND
BEGAN RIDING TOWARD THE WHITEHOUSE.
(HORSE-GALLOPING NOISE)HE THEN DISMOUNTED, WALKING OVER
