>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW
MEMOIR CALLED "DRAMA: AN ACTOR'S
EDUCATION."
I AM GOING TO ACT LIKE I'VE READ
HIS BOOK.
PLEASE WELCOME JOHN LITHGOW!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JOHN!
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
SIT DOWN.
SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> NICE TO BE HERE AGAIN.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, YOU HAVE
DONE IT ALL.
YOU'RE AN EMMY AND TONY AWARD
WINNING ACTOR.
YOU'RE STAR OF STAGE, SCREEN,
T.V..
YOU'VE AUTHORED EIGHT BOOKS FOR
CHILDREN.
YOU'VE WON GRAMMYS FOR YOUR
ALBUMS AND NOW YOU HAVE AUTHORED
A NEW MEMOIR WHICH IS HUMBLY
TITLED "DRAMA: AN ACTOR'S
EDUCATION."
I DO NOT KNOW THAT ACTORS NEEDED
EDUCATION.
(LAUGHTER)
SALINGER SAID HE THOUGHT ACTORS
EDUCATION COULD GET IN THE WAY.
DON'T YOU NEED TO BE A LITTLE
EMPTY UP HERE SO YOU CAN FILL IT
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES?
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO
BE AN ACTOR.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> I THINK SO.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU JUST GO OUT
THERE AND WING IT?
>> SOME CAN BUT THEY DON'T LAST
LONG.
LOOK AT ME, I'VE LASTED UNTIL 65
YEARS OLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen:'S'S THE KEY TO AN
ACTOR'S EDUCATION BECAUSE AS FAR
AS I CAN TELL ACTORS ARE REALLY
GOOD LIARS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, THE ESSENCE OF ACTING
IS PRETENDING AND BASICALLY
DECEIVING PEOPLE INTO SORT OF
ACCEPTING AN INVITATION OF
REALITY, YES.
BUT I THINK IT JUST COMES WITH
EXPERIENCE.
I MEAN, THE ESSENCE OF IT IS
IT'S EXPERIENCE BOTH ON STAGE
AND OFF STAGE, I THINK.
THAT'S WHAT MY BOOK IS ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT ALL THE TIME I'VE
SPENT ON STAGE AS A VERY, VERY
YOUNG BOY.
I MEAN, I STARTED ACTING BEFORE
I EVEN REMEMBER.
>> Stephen: YOUR FATHER RAN A
SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL.
>> VERY.
I GREW UP IN A THEATER FAMILY.
HE RAN SHAKESPEARE FESTIVALS ALL
OVER OHIO THE WHOLE TIME I WAS
GROWING UP.
SO THAT'S WHERE MY EDUCATION
KICKED IN IN SPITE OF MYSELF.
BY OSMOSIS I WAS BECOMING AN
ACTOR.
>> Stephen: WHERE IN OHIO?
STRATFORD UPON CLEVELAND?
(LAUGHTER)
WHERE IN OHIO DID YOU LIVE.
>> THE GREAT LAKES THEATER
FESTIVAL IN CLEVELAND IS GOING
STRONG 50 YEARS AFTER HE STARTED
IT.
>> Stephen: WAS YOUR FATHER
DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU WENT INTO
THE FAMILY BUSINESS?
BECAUSE YOU GOT A HARVARD
EDUCATION.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO INTO, LIKE,
HEDGE FUNDS?
SOMETHING THAT SERVES HUMANITY.
(LAUGHTER)
DOING GOD'S WORK.
>> (LAUGHS)
WELL, IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD
MENTION THAT.
CLEARLY YOU HAVEN'T READ THE
BOOK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NO.
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO COME
HERE AND ACT IT OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, LET ME TELL YOU.
>> Stephen: PLEASE DO.
>> ALL MY LIFE I ACTED IN MY
FATHERS COMPANIES, HE DIRECTED
ME, WE ACTED TOGETHER.
I WENT OFF TO HARVARD AND TOLD
HIM IN MY SENIOR YEAR THAT I WAS
GOING TO GO OFF TO ENGLAND AND
STUDY ATLANTA IN DRAMA SCHOOL
AND HIS FACE FELL LIKE I TOLD
HIM I'D CONTRACTED A TERMINAL
DISEASE.
NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT
IT WAS OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY THAT
I WAS GOING TO END UP AN ACTOR.
IT IS TRUE I HADN'T INTENDED TO
BE OR WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR WHEN
I WAS GROWING UP.
>> Stephen: WHAT SUCKED YOU?
>> APPLAUSE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IF THAT'S THE
CRITERIA THAN I'M AN ACTOR.
>> OH, YOU'RE AN ACTOR, STEPHEN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ALL MEN ARE IN SOME
WAYS, AREN'T THEY?
>> ALL BUSINESS IS SHOW
BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID THEY LOOKED
LIKE YOU'D CONTRACTED A DISEASE.
IS THERE ANY CURE FOR ACTING?
>> IS THERE ANY CURE FOR ACTING?
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD
MAKE YOU WANT TO STOP ACTING?
>> I SUPPOSE YOU COULD FIND
SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU
PREFER TO ACTING.
OR YOU COULD GO LONG ENOUGH
WITHOUT EVER BEING GIVEN A JOB
THAT YOU FINALLY QUIT ACTING.
>> IT BREAKS YOUR HEART.
>> IT'S A HEART BREAKING
PROFESSION.
THERE'S A LOT OF HEART BREAK IN
THE BOOK.
A LOT OF LAUGHS, A LOT OF TEARS,
A LOT OF DRAMA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHEN YOUR MEMOIR
"DRAW MARX AN ACTOR'S EDUCATION"
IS INEVITABLY MADE INTO A MOVIE.
WHO DO YOU WANT TO PLAY YOU?
>> RYAN GOSLING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: TO CAPTURE YOUR SIX
PACK ABS?
>> HE LOOKS JUST LIKE ME AS A
YOUNG MAN.
>> Stephen: JOHN LITHGOW, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR GRACING US WITH
YOUR DRAMATIC PRESENCE.
>> STEPHEN, THANK YOU FOR
GRACING ME WITH YOURS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: JOHN LITHGOW "DRAMA:
AN ACTOR'S EDUCATION."
