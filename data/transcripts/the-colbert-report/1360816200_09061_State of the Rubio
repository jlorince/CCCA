I GUESS WE'LL ADDRESS OUR
CHALLENGES.
OF COURSE, OBAMA WAS JUST THE
OPENING ACT FOR FORTNIGHT'S MAIN E--
FOR THE NIGHT'S MAIN EVENT THE
LONG AWAITED RUBIO ADDRESS GIVEN
BY FLORIDA SENATOR AND BOARD
CERTIFICATEIFIED MINORITY MARCO
RUBIO.
>> RUBIO WITH THE REPUBLICANS
HAVE PROBABLY ONE OF BEST
COMMUNICATORS SINCE RONALD
REAGAN.
>> ALL EYES ON OUR RISING STAR.
I MIGHT SAY OUR ONLY STAR.
>> Stephen: NO PRESSURE MARCO,
YOU ARE JUST THE EGG FROM WHICH
THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL BE
BORN SO WE SHOULD PUT ALL OUR
EGG INTO ONE BASKET AND THEN
COUNT OUR CHICKEN BEFORE IT
HATCHES AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT
WHY NOT MAKE THE A HAND BASKET
AND TAKE IT SOME PLACE REALLY
WARM.
>> I'M MARCO RUBIO.
I HAVE THE HONOR OF RESPONDING
TO THE STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW
REPUBLICANS.
THE FAVORITE ATTACK IS THAT
THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE DON'T AGREE
WITH THEM ONLY CARE ABOUT RICH
PEOPLE.
ONE OF THINGS FOR GROWTH IS THE
EMERGENCY INDUSTRY OVER THE NEXT
DECADE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOTHING HAS FRUSTRATED ME MORE
THAN FALSE CHOICES LIKE THE ONE
THE PRESIDENT LAID OUT TONIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: DON'T WORRY,
SENATOR RUBIO, NOBODY NOTICED
THAT YOU GAVE A SPEECH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, FOLKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK -- I SAY PERSONALLY I
THINK IT'S A BOLD MOVE TO DUCK
OFF CAMERA DURING THE BIGGEST
SPEECH OF YOUR LIFE.
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT HE WAS
THINKING.
JIMMY, DO YOU HAVE ANY FOOTAGE
OF WHAT HE WAS THINKING?
>> IF WE CAN GROW OUR ENERGY
INDUSTRY, IT WILL MAKE US ENERGY
INDEPENDENT.
♪ ♪
[LAUGHTER]
FALSE CHOICES LIKE THE ONE THE
PRESIDENT LAID OUT TONIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: FOLKS, ULTIMATELY
IS THIS REALLY THAT BIG OF A
DEAL JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
THING THAT PEOPLE WILL EVER
REMEMBER?
[LAUGHTER]
WE TURN TO FOX NEWS.
>> I COULD SEE FOR THE FIRST
TIME THAT HE WAS NERVOUS.
>> IT WAS VERY AWKWARD.
THIS RESPONSE IS ALWAYS A TOUGH
SPOT.
HERE YOU ARE IN A ROOM WITH
CAMERAS AND ALL THAT.
>> Stephen: YEAH, HOT CAMERA
AND ALL THAT IT'S A UNIQUE
SITUATION.
WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT YOU ARE
NEVER UNDER PRESSURE.
LET ME, FOLKS, LET ME TELL YOU
FROM EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT EASY
BEING ON TV.
YOU'VE GOT THE SWELTERING
LIGHTS, AUDIENCE, THE CAMERAS,
YOU KNOW, KNOWING YOU ARE BEING
WATCHED BY MILLIONS THAT THEY
ARE JUDGING YOUR EVERY MOVE
AND --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THEY MAKE THE BIGGEST THINGS
OUT OF SMALLEST MISTAKES.
CAN REALLY GIVE A PERSON A
LITTLE BIT OF COTTON MOUTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WATER WHERE
YOU NEED IT BUT THAT'S NOT
REALLY A PROBLEM BECAUSE A TRUE
PROFESSIONAL KNOWS, YOU KNOW,
HOW TO COVER.
YOU COVER YOUR PROBLEM BY ALWAYS
MAINTAINING EYE CONTACT WITH THE
HOME VIEWER AND CONNECTING WITH
THE AUDIENCE ON A HUMAN LEVEL,
MAKE THEM OVERLOOK YOUR
DIFFICULTIES, JUST KEEP THE
WORDS COMING AND NO ONE WILL
NOTICE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JUST NEVER LOSE EYE CONTACT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICE I
GOT A LITTLE THIRSTY THERE BUT
THAT'S HOW PROS LIKE ME AND
MARCO RUBIO DO IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
