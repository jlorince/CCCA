BALTIMORE.
BECAUSE AFTER THE BATTLE OF FORTMcHENRY, THE COMMANDER OF THE
FORT, MAJOR GEORGE ARMSTEAD,ESSENTIALLY TOOK IT HOME AS A
PERSONAL SOUVENIR.

>> EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A VERYEXPENSIVE PIECE OF GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY.
IT COST 400 BUCKS.
>> Stephen:  THE BATTLE OFFORT McHENRY WHICH WAS 200
YEARS AGO...?
>> TOMORROW.
>> Stephen:  OK, AND THAT IS THEBATTLE FRANCIS SCOTT KEY IS
DESCRIBING IN THE STAR SPANGLEDBANNER.
>> EXACTLY.
FRANCIS SCOTT KEY WAS OUT IN THEMIDDLE OF THE PATAPSCO RIVER ON
A FLAG-OF-TRUCE SHIP AND HEWATCHED THE BRITISH FLEET
BOMBARD FORT McHENRY FOR 27HOURS.

>> Stephen:  WHAT WAS OURNATIONAL ANTHEM BEFORE THE STAR
SPANGLED BANNER.
>> WE HAD RATHER PATRIOTICSONGS.
"YANKEE DOODLE," "HAILCOLUMBIA."

BA-DA-DA-DUM.

A PATRIOTIC SONG DURING THECIVIL WAR BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT
THE FLAG.
THE FLAG WAS A SYMBOL OF LOYALTYDURING THE CIVIL WAR.

AND HE HAD GONE OUT TO THEBRITISH FLEET TO TRY TO SPRING
AN AMERICAN PRISONER, ADR. BEANS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED
BY THE BRITISH AND TAKEN OUTON BOARD THE BRITISH FLAGSHIP
>> Stephen:  SO DR. BEANS WASOUT ON THE BRITISH FLAGSHIP.
>> DR. BEANS.
>> Stephen:  AND DID THEY GETHIM BACK?
>> HE DID.
>> Stephen:  I THOUGHT THEYWOULD'VE SAID NO BEANS.
HOW DID KEY MANAGE TO WRITE THESTAR SPANGLED BANNER WHEN YOU
KNOW HE HAD HIS HAND OVER HISHEART THE ENTIRE TIME.
WHEN DID THAT START?
DO YOU KNOW WHEN HE PUT OUR HANDOVER OUR HEART, TAKE OUR HATS
OFF, STAND UP, THAT KIND OFSTUFF.
>> WELL, BELEIVE IT OR NOT, WEUSED TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE
FLAG GOING LIKE THIS.
