EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS I'VE GOT TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM STILL
ALL AGLOW OVER AMERICA'S VICTORY IN WISCONSIN.
AND WHEN YOU THINK OF WISCONSIN YOU HI OF SMALL TOWNS, BASTIONS OF OLD-FASHIONED VALUES LIKE
TRUST AND HONESTY.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO EASILY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY MUSIC MEN.
(LAUGHTER) BUT IN THESE HARD TIMES MANY SMALL TOWNS ARE LOSING THEIR MORAL COMPASS.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO PROFILE ONE MAN WHO IS FIGHTING BACK.

I'M THE HIRED GUN.
I COME IN AND TRY TO CLEAN UP THE TOWN.
>> Stephen: HIS NAME IS PASTOR LARRY JOHNSON AND HE IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
