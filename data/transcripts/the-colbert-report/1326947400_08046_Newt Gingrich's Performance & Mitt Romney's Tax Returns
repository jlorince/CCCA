[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.
EVERYBODY IN HERE, OUT THERE,
EVERYONE IN UTERO, WHO MIGHT BE
HERE ANY SECOND.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, WITH JUST THREE DAYS LEFT
UNTIL THE BIG VOTE, ALL EYES ARE
ON SOUTH CAROLINA.
AND SO FAR ONLY NEWT GINGRICH
HAS A HEAD BIG ENOUGH TO BLOCK
EVERYONE'S VIEW.
NEWTON'S STRONG PERFORMANCE IN
MONDAY'S DEBATE HAS GIVEN HIM
NEWT-MENTUM, PERHAPS ENOUGH TO
OVERCOME HIS APPARENT GOOD
EVENING-NERTIA.
HE KNOWS THE STAKES COULDN'T BE
HIGHER.
>> IF I WIN THE PRIMARY, I WILL
PROBABLY BE THE NOMINEE.
IF I DON'T WIN, WE'LL PROBABLY
ELECT A MODERATE.
>> Stephen: MEANWHILE, MITT
ROMNEY IS GETTING HIT WITH TOUGH
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS TAX RETURN.
>> GOVERNOR, WILL YOU RELEASE
YOUR INCOME TAX RETURNS?
>> YOU KNOW, I LOOKEDWHAT HAS
BEEN DONE WITH CAMPAIGNS IN THE
PAST WITH SENATOR McCAIN AND
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AND
OTHERS.
THEY'VE TENDED TO RELEASE TAX
RECORDS IN APRIL OR TAX SEASON,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S BEEN
THE TRADITION, I'M NOT OPPOSED
TO DOING THAT.
TIME WILL TELL.
I HAVE NOTHING IN THEM THAT
SUGGESTS THERE'S ANY PROBLEM, AN
I'M HAPPY TO DO SO.
I SORT OF FEEL LIKE WE'RE
SHOWING A LOT OF EXPOSURE AT
THIS POINT, AND IF I BECOME OUR
NOMINEE, I'M... AND WHAT'S
HAPPENED IN HISTORY IS PEOPLE
HAVE RELEASED THEM BY APRIL OF
THE COMING YEAR.
AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT I'D DO.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: SO THERE YOU HAVE
IT, FOLKS.
HE WILL PROBABLY MOSTLY MAYB-LEY
RELEASE HIS TAX RETURN MS APRIL,
ASSUMING HE IS FINISHED GIVING
THAT ANSWER BY THEN.
BECAUSE, FOLKS, THE NEXT DAY, HE
STILL HADN'T GOTTEN TO THE VERB.
JIM?
>> WHAT'S THE EFFECTIVE RATE
I'VE BEEN PAYING?
IT'S PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE 15%
RATE THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE MY
LAST TEN YEARS I'VE, UH, MY
INCOME COMES OVERWHELMINGLY FROM
INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE PAST
RATHER THAN ORDINARY INCOME OR
RATHER THAN EARNED ANNUAL
INCOME, AND THEN I GET SPEAKERS
FEES FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT NOT
VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: THAT ANSWER,
FOLKS, IS SHOCKING.
PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY TO HEAR MITT
ROMNEY SPEAK.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT AS HE SAYS, THEY DON'T PAY
HIM VERY MUCH, JUST $374,000
LAST YEAR.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS.
IF THAT WAS HIS ENTIRE SALARY,
MITT'S INCOME LEVEL WOULD DROP
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE TOP 1%.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I AM CALLING FOR FULL
DISCLOSURE, AND NOT JUST FROM
MITT ROMNEY.
I'M CALLING ON NEWT GINGRICH TO
RELEASE HIS TAX TURN, RICK
SANTORUM TO RELEASE HIS TAX
RETURNS, RON PAUL TO RELEASE THE
TREASURE MAP TO HIS CHEST OF
GOLD.
AND, FOLKS, NOT JUST...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW.
NOT JUST 2011.
I MEAN THE LAST TEN YEARS OF
TREASURE MAPS.
DEAD MAN'S COVE, GHOST ISLAND,
