>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINKIT'S ANY SECRET OUT THERE THAT I
AM TOUGH ON CRIME.
BUT OUR CRIMINAL-CODDLINGPRESIDENT DOES NOT SHARE MY
TASTE FOR UNYIELDING JUSTICE.
( LAUGHTER )HIS LATEST MOVE MAKES MEANTIME
TO TURN IN MY BADGE IT THAT IMADE FOR MYSELF.
JIM.
>> THOUSANDS OF CONVICTED DRUGOFFENDERS COULD BE WALKING FREE
SOON THANKS TO THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION'S SWEEPING NEW
PLAN FOR CLEMENCY.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTFORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE NEW
CRITERIA TODAY AS PART OF ANEFFORT TO SHRINK THE PRISON
POPULATION.
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL JAMESCOLE SAID IT'S AIMED PRIMARILY
AT DRUG OFFENDERS GIVEN HARSHPENALTIES UNDER OLD SENTENCING
GUIDELINES.
>> THE PRESIDENT COULD GRANTCLEMENCY TO "HUNDREDS PERHAPS
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE."
>> Stephen:  "HUNDREDS,PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE?"
THAT'S LIKE EMPTYING THREEPRISON CELLS.
( LAUGHTER )AND WHY ARE WE BEING SUBJECTED
TO THIS JAILHOUSE CROCK?
IT'S ALL--( LAUGHTER )
IT'S ALL PART OF A COMPREHENSIVEEFFORT TO ROLL BACK
LONG-MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCESMETED OUT AFTER THE
CRACK-FUELED CRIME WAVE OF THE80s.
OH, GREAT!
NOW THESE 80s THUGS WILL BEOUT ON THE STREET IN THEIR
ONE-STRAP OVERALLS SEEKINGREVENGE AGAINST McGRUFF THE
CRIME DOG.
YOU KNOW THIS IS A BAD IDEA,FOLKS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA
GOT IT FROM THE ONLY PEOPLE LESSTRUSTED THAN CONVICTS --
CONGRESS.
YOU SEE, BACK IN 2010 CONGRESSPASSES THE SO-CALLED FAIR
SENTENCING ACT TO REDUCE THE100-1 DISPARITY FOR SENTENCES
FOR CRACK COCAINE AND THOSE FORPOWDERED COCAINE.
HUGE MISTAKE, FOLKS.
THEY MAY BE THE SAME DRUG BUTTHERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT CRACK
OFFENDERS THAT JUST MADE THEMSEEM MORE...
CONVICTABLE.
( LAUGHTER )SOMEWHERE ON THEIR I DON'T KNOW
WHAT.
WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A SINISTERMOTIVE BEHIND APPLYING THE LAW
EQUALLY.
>> MORE "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE"CARDS FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IS IT COMPASSION OR CLEVERPOLITICS?
>> HE'S AWARE MIDTERMS ARECOMING UP AND IT'S A WAY TO AMP
UP HIS BASE.
>> BECAUSE IT'S 2014 MYPOLITICAL MIND STARTS TO WONDER,
WHY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THISNOW?
AGAIN, IS THIS A NATIONALPRIORITY?
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK IT'S ALLTO RALLY THE --
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT,OBAMA IS CLEARLY RALLYING THE
LIBERAL BASE BY RELEASING DRUGDEALERS.
IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR.
REPUBLICANS CAN'T RALLY THEIRSUPPORTERS THAT WAY.
THERE ARE NO BANKERS IN JAIL TORELEASE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND-- A LOT OF BANKER FANS HERETONIGHT, TOO.
( LAUGHTER )AND BREAK OUT THE VEGAN
CHAMPAGNE, LEFTIES.
BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BE EASIERFOR THESE HOODLUMS TO GET OUT.
>> CONVICTS MUST BE SERVING ASENTENCE UNDER OLD LAW THAT IS
GREATER THAN REQUIRED UNDERCURRENT LAW.
CONVICTED OF NONVIOLENTCRIMES WITHOUT LINKS TO
ORGANIZED CRIME.
HAVE SERVED AT LEAST 10 YEARS.
HAVE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANTCRIMINAL HISTORY.
GOOD PRISON RECORDS AND NOHISTORY OF VIOLENCE.
>> Stephen:  OH, SURE, THEYMAY NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF
VIOLENCE BUT WHAT ABOUTA FUTURE OF VIOLENCE?
BECAUSE IF I'D BEEN THROWN INJAIL FOR POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA
THEN GOT OUT 10 YEARS LATER ANDFOUND OUT POT IS LEGAL NOW.
( LAUGHTER )I'M PRETTY SURE I'D SHOOT
SOMEONE.
