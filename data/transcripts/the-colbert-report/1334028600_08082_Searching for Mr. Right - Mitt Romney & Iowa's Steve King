JUST LIKE SANTA.
NOW FOLKS, IT'S GOING TO CATCH ON.
FOLKS, IT'S OFFICIALLY THE UNOFFICIAL START OF THE 2012 GENERAL ELECTION.
AFTER A BRUISING REPUBLICAN PRIMARY SEASON, THE FOREPLAY IS OVER AND LIKE ALL
REPUBLICAN FOREPLAY, THERE WAS EXPENSIVE, VINDICTIVE AND ENDED WITH SOMETHING PRETTY PREDICTABLE.
BUT NOW THAT MITT ROMNEY HAS THE NOMINATION PRETTY MUCH NAILED DOWN, THERE'S ONE
QUESTION EVERYONE'S ASKING.
WHO WILL ROMNEY PICK AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
FOR MONTHS NAMES LIKE MARTHA MARTHA-- MARCO RUBBIO AND PAUL RYAN HAVE SWIRLED
THROUGH THE RUMOR MILL.
UNFORTUNATELY, BAIN CAPITAL BOUGHT THE MILL AND LAID OFF ALL THE RUMOR [BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER) KEEP ON GOING.
WELL, KEEP GOING.
WELL THAT'S TO THE GOING TO STOP ME FROM SPECULATING WILDLY.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEW SEGMENT SEARCHING FOR MR. RIGHT.
IT IS CRUCIAL THAT ROMNEY PICK A RUNNING MATE WHO WILL HELP HIM WITH THE GROUP HE'S WEAK WITH.
WOMEN, HISPANICS,
AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
EVANGELICAL CHRITSIANS, AND REPUBLICANS.
NOW ONE MAN OUT THERE WHO WOULD SHORE UP SUPPORT WITH THE FAR RIGHT IS IOWA
CONGRESSMAN AND UNBLINKING NORDIC-- STEVE KING.
YOU MAY REMEMBER CONGRESSMAN KING FROM THIS HISTORIC EXCHANGE DURING MY CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY.
>> IN IOWA WE KNOW CORN.
AND I THOUGHT WAS CURIOUS THAT ON THE FARM WHERE YOU HARVEST THE CORN I WAS
WATCHING YOU ACTUALLY UNLOAD A CRATE RATHER THAN LOAD THE CRATE.
SO I WAS CURIOUS IT LOOKED LIKE THE CORN WAS GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION.
AND I ONLY PRESUME THEY MUST HAVE RUN THE FILM BACKYARDS WITH.
>> I WAS A CORN PACKER AND I KNOW THAT TERM IS OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE CORN
PACK CERTIFICATE A DEROGATORY TERM FOR A GAY IOWAN.
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE TO REPRESENTATIVE KING.
I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THE CORRECT TERM IS COBB GOBBLER.
WELL-- IN THE LAST WEEK CONGRESSMAN KING HAS REPEATEDLY PROVEN WHY HE IS
THE NUMBER ONE CHOICE TO BE THE NUMBER TWO GUY.
STARTING WITH THIS NUANCED CRITIQUE OF OBAMACARE.
>> WHAT I SAID IS THAT IN EVERY DECADE, IN EVERY STATE THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
BABIES THAT WERE BORN, LIVE AND DIED.
AND SOME OF THEM A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE, WITHOUT EVER USING A DOLLAR WORTH OF
HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES.
>> Stephen: YES, IN EVERY STATE BABIES ARE BORN, ALL THE TIME WHO ARE DELIVERED
AT HOME, DON'T GET ANY VACCINATIONS, NEVER SEE A DENTIST, MAKE IT THROUGH
SCHOOL WITHOUT EVER GETTING STREP THROAT OR HEAD LIES OR PINK EYE OR MONOHAVE PERFECT
VISION, NEVER GET SICK AS AN ADULT, KEEP ALL OF THEIR MENTAL FACULTIES AND DIE
HAPPILY AT THE AGE OF 110 SURROUNDED BY ALL THEIR LOVE OG CHILDREN WHO ALSO WERE
BORN AT HOME AND FEVER GOT VACCINATED OR SICK.
AFTER ALL-- AFTER ALL ALL-- AMERICANS WERE FINE BEFORE MODERN MEDICINE.
THEY WORKED HARD.
RAISED FAMILIES.
AND PASSED AWAY OF NATURAL CAUSES AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 28.
REASON NUMBER TWO KING IS THE PERFECT VEEP.
STEVE KING IS LOOKING OUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
LAST MONDAY HE OUTLINED HOW BUSINESS OWNER KOS AVOID DISCRIMINATION LAWSUITS FROM GAY EMPLOYEES.
>> I WOULD THINK THAT UNLESS SOMEONE MAKES THEIR SEXUALITY PUBLIC, IT'S NOT
ANYBODY'S BUSINESS.
SO NEITHER IS IT OUR BUSINESS TO TELL AN EMPLOYER WHO TO HIRE.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY'S SEXUALITY YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM.
>> Stephen: HEAR THAT, THE GAYS, IT'S UP TO YOU TO KEEP US FROM DISCRIMINATING.
BECAUSE ONCE WE KNOW YOU'RE GAY, I HAVE A NATURAL DESIRE TO FIRE YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND UNLIKE GAYS,
DISCRIMINATING IS NOT A CHOICE.
THAT'S WHY I INSIST NO ONE AT THE REPORT TELL ME THEY ARE SEXUAL ORIENTATION, FROM
THE LOWEST INTERN TO MY CAMERAMAN JULIAN, RIGHT JULES.
ALL RIGHT, SAY HI TO THE WIFE AND KIDS FOR ME.
SO FOLKS, WE DON'T NEED ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS ANY MORE THAN WE NEED THE
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
YOU HEAR THAT, DISABLED PEOPLE?
STOP RUBBING YOUR DISABILITY LIFESTYLE IN MY FACE.
JUST LET ME CONTINUE THINKING THAT YOU ARE A LAZY MAN IN A CHAIR FROM THE FUTURE.
(LAUGHTER) AND I SAY YOU GO, STEVE KING.
AND I ASSUME THIS MEANS YOU WON'T BE TELLING US WHETHER YOU'RE GAY.
ALTHOUGH COMING UP WITH A GREAT EXCUSE TO KEEP EVERYONE IN THE CLOSE SET A PRETTY BIG HINT.
SO MITT ROMNEY, TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT STEVE KING FOR THE TICKET.
BUT NOT TOO CLOSE.
YOU HE MIGHT GET THE WRONG IDEA.
AFTER ALL WE'RE COMING UP ON
