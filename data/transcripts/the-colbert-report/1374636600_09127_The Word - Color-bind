LOOSE-FITTING BREEZY PLAYED?
I AM BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THANKFULLY THERE'S A WAY TO
ACHIEVE RACIAL HARMONY.
AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S WORD.
COLOR BIND.
NATION, IT'S TIME WE
CAUCASIAN-AMERICANS ACCEPT THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO FURTHERING THE
RACIAL DIALOGUE THE BALL IS IN
OUR COURT EVEN THOUGH HAVING THE
BALL ON A COURT HAS NEVER BEEN
OUR STRONG SUIT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TAKEN THE
FIRST STEP BY FRANKLY DISCUSSING
AS A BLACK MAN HOW IT FEELS TO
BE IN A ROOM FULL OF WHITE
PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED OF HIM.
NOW I BELIEVE IT'S MY TURN TO BE
HONEST ABOUT THE WHITE
EXPERIENCE.
BLACK PEOPLE ARE SCARY.
AND, FOLKS, THAT'S NOT JUST ME
SAYING THAT.
I MEAN, JUST ASK THE TV.
>> HERE IS THE HEADLINE.
YOUNG BLACK MEN COMMIT HOMICIDES
AT A RATE 10 TIMES GREATER THAN
WHITES AND HISPANICS COMBINED.
>> HERE'S AN INCONVENIENT FACT.
ANY TIME THERE'S INTERRACIAL
CRIME, THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING
CHANCE THAT THE VICTIM IS GOING
TO BE WHITE AND THAT THE
CRIMINAL IS GOING TO BE BLACK.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CRIME
NUMBERS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS --
THIS IS ASTONISHING --
AFRICAN-AMERICANS MAKE UP 13% OF
THE POPULATION, BUT COMMIT MORE
THAN HALF THE MURDERS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NOT
PREJUDICE.
THAT'S JUST MATH.
SO IF IN 2011 OUT OF 42 MILLION
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, 4,149 WERE
ARRESTED FOR MURDER WHICH MEANS
WE CAN REASONABLY BE SCARED OF
9/1,000ths OF ONE PERCENT
OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
NOW, DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT.
UNTIL YOU CONSIDER... UNTIL YOU
CONSIDER THAT WE DON'T KNOW
WHICH 9/1,000th OF ONE
PERCENT.
SO, TO BE SAFE, WE HAVE TO BE
SCARED OF ALL OF THEM.
FOLKS, IT'S THE SAME REASON...
FOLKS, THIS IS THE SAME REASON I
ASSUME ALL ARABS ARE TERRORISTS
AND ALL IRISHMEN ARE
LEPRECHAUNS.
I'M GOING TO GET YOUR POT OF
GOLD, DANIEL DAY LEWIS.
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
YOU'RE SAYING, "STEPHEN, THAT'S
OUTRAGEOUS.
WITH THOSE NUMBERS, IT MAKES NO
SENSE TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF ALL
BLACK PEOPLE.
YOU SHOULD ONLY BE SUSPICIOUS OF
BLACK MEN."
FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION.
SECOND OF ALL, OKAY, YOU'RE
WRONG.
WE HAVE TO BE SCARED OF BLACK
WOMEN TOO BECAUSE THANKS TO
HOLLYWOOD, I KNOW THAT MANY
BLACK WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY BLACK
MEN.
SO NOW, OKAY, NOW THAT I'VE DONE
THIS IN THE DIALOGUE OF RACIAL
UNDERSTANDING, WHITE PEOPLE HAVE
DONE OUR PART.
OKAY.
WE HAVE SHOWN THE COURAGE TO
ADMIT WE'RE TERRIFIED, BUT IT'S
A TWO-WAY STREET, BLACK PEOPLE.
WHICH IS WHY RIGHT NOW I WOULD
LIKE TO ADDRESS ALL MY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VIEWERS.
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
CHANGE HOW WHITE PEOPLE FEEL
ABOUT YOU AND ACCORDING TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE'S A SIMPLE
WAY YOU CAN DO IT.
>> AND THERE ARE VERY FEW
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN WHO HAVEN'T
HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF WALKING
ACROSS THE STREET AND HEARING
THE LOCKS CLICK ON THE DOORS OF
CARS.
THAT HAPPENED TO ME, AT LEAST
BEFORE I WAS A SENATOR.
>> Stephen: SO THE ANSWER IS
OBVIOUS.
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO BECOME
SENATORS.
ONCE YOU'RE ELECTEDDED TO THE
SENATE, NO ONE'S GOING TO THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO
THEM.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
PLUS BLACK MEN CAMPAIGNING'S IS
EASY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KNOCK ON A
LOT OF STRANGERS' DOORS.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
AND BELIEVE ME, ONCE YOU'VE
LAUNCHEDDED YOUR POLITICAL
CAREER, MAYBE SOME DAY YOU TOO
CAN BE PRESIDENT.
THEN YOU'LL NEVER INSPIRE
IRRATIONAL FEAR IN WHITE PEOPLE
AGAIN.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
