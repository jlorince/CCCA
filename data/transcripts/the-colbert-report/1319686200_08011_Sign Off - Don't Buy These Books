EVERYBODY.
BEFORE WE GO, TWO OF MY WRITERS HAVE NEW BOOKS OUT.
THERE IS "SAD MONSTERS" BY FRANK LESSER.
AND "BAD FOR THE JEWS" BY SCOTT SHERMAN.
I WANT TO SAY TO BOTH OF THEM, I AM INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON OUTSIDE PROJECTS.
NO ONE BUY THEIR BOOKS.
DO NOT GO TO AMAZON.COM AND BUY "SAD MONSTERS" BY FRANK LESSER
OR "BAD FOR THE JEWS" BY SCOTT SHERMAN.
AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY FREE PRESS BY TALKING ABOUT THOSE BOOKS.
THOSE BOOKS AGAIN, "SAD MONSTERS," "BAD FOR THE JEWS."
WELL, I HOPE THAT TAUGHT YOU A LESSON, BOYS.
KNOCK IT OFF.
