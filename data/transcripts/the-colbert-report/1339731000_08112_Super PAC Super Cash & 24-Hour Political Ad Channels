(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, ROMNEY'S OTHER ONLY HOPE IS THAT HE'S ATTRACTING A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC.
THESE DEAD WHITE MEN.
>> IT WAS REVEALED YESTERDAY THAT SUPER PACS ON THE RIGHT WILL PROBABLY PROVIDE MITT
ROMNEY WITH CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IF NOT MORE THAN THAT.
>> Stephen: A BILLION DOLLARS ON THE ELECTION.
JUST MORE EVIDENCE THAT OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY HAS LED TO WASTEFUL SPENDING.
ALL OF THIS SUPER PAC SUPERCASH IS THANKS TO CITIZENS UNITED.
THE SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH ESTABLISHED THAT IN POLITICS MONEY EQUALS FREE SPEECH.
AS JUSTUS ANTHONY KENNEDY EXPLAINED IN THE MAJORITY OPINION, AND I QUOTE-- (KA-CHING  (KA-CHING)
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, OF COURSE THE HAND RINGERS OUT THERE IS A THAT INJECTING THAT MUCH
MONEY INTO THE ELECTION IS BAD.
BUT IN A RECENT COLUMN POLITICAL PUNDIT AND POPCORN MAGNATE GEORGE WELLS HAS A
CONTROL REPOSTE WRITING LAST YEAR PROCTER & GAMBLE SPENT $3 BILLION MORE THAT WILL BE
SPENT BY THE OBAMA RESPONDENT NOOM-- ROMNEY CAMPAIGNS AND SUPER PACS SUPPORTING THEM.
SO MORE IS SPENT TO INFLUENCE AMERICAN'S CHOICE OF THEIR DETERGENT THAN OF THEIR PRESIDENT.
PRECISELY.
BUYING DETERGENT AND ELECTING A PRESIDENT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THING.
BECAUSE WHEN I BUY TIDE, I HAVE TO USE IT FOR FOUR YEARS AND SO DOES EVERYONE IN AMERICA.
ALSO, TIDE GETS TO APPROVE DRONE STRIKES ON ITS ENEMIES.
(LAUGHTER) IN FACT--  (APPLAUSE) IN FACT, I'M SURPRISED REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T ALREADY
NOMINATED TIDE FOR PRESIDENT.
IT GETS YOUR WHITES WHITER THAN WHITE.
BUT SHOCKINGLY, THERE MAY BE A DOWNSIDE TO HAVING OUR POLITICAL PROCESS ENGULFED
BY A TSUNAMI OF TSU-MONEY.
THERE IS SO MUCH SUPER PAC CASH TO BE SPPBT THIS YEAR THAT TV NETWORKS COULD
ACTUALLY RUN OUT OF AIR TIME TO SELL FOR POLITICAL ADS.
THERE'S A FINITY NUMBER OF COMMERCIALS?
YOU WOULDN'T GUESS THAT FROM WATCHING MOVIES ON TNT.
(LAUGHTER) POLITICIANS RAISE ALL THIS MONEY TO SPEND ON TV.
NOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TV TO SPEND IT ON.
ALL THAT MONEY'S BACKING UP.
WE'RE GOING TO GET BLUE BILLED.
(LAUGHTER) LUCKILY, LUCKILY, FOLKS,
THERE IS AN INNOVATION IN FREE SPEECH FROM FORMER HAWAII GOVERNOR AND REJECTED
SUPERMAN LOVE INTEREST LINDA LINGLE.
SHE IS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE SEAT VACATED BY DAN AKAKA.
LINGLE WAS HOPING TO FOLLOW AKAKA IN HAWAII LONG TRADITION OF SENATORS WITH HILARIOUS NAMES.
(LAUGHTER) SHE IS CURRENTLY TRAILING HER LIKELY DEMOCRATIC O UPON ENT BY 20 POINTS BUT ALL
THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.
>> A U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE IN HAWAII IS GIVING THE TERM CHANNEL SURFING A WHOLE NEW MEANING.
FORMER HI HIGH GOVERNOR LINDA LINGLE HAS LAUNCHED HER OWN CABLE CHANNEL.
>> BEGINNING ON OR ABOUT JUNE 21st LINGLE 2012 WILL BE ADDED TO OCEANIC CABLE'S
DIGITAL LINE-UP.
>> WHICH MEANS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH HER ANY TIME OF THE DAY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
LINDA LINGLE IS USING CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO START HER OWN CABLE CHANNEL.
SO NOW YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HER ANY TIME YOU TURN ON THE TV.
JUST LIKE SENATOR SEACREST.
(LAUGHTER) WITH LINGLE 2012, LINGLE CAN REACH VOTERS WHO WILL WATCH 24 HOURS OF POLITICAL ADS,
KEY DEMOGRAPHICS LIKE INSOMNIACS, PEOPLE IN TRACTION, PEOPLE WITHOUT CAN'T FIND THE REMOTE,
PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER A BOOKCASE.
M.C.'S BEST BUY STARS AND CATS LEFT ALONE WITH THE TV FOR COMFORT.
(LAUGHTER) PERSONALLY,--  (LAUGHTER) THEY MAKE GREAT COMPANIONS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT SORT OF PROGRAMMING SHE'LL HAVE.
FROM HER MORNING SHOW ALOHA LINGLE TO HER LATE NIGHT SIGNOFF ALLOWA LINGLE.
(LAUGHTER) I SAY THIS BREAKTHROUGH IN FREE SPEECH IS TOO IMPORTANT TO KEEP ISOLATED ON HAWAII
LIKE TOM SELL ECK OR LEPROSY.
THIS, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME.
AND IF MONEY IS SPEECH,
SPEECH THAT INFORMS VOTERS,
AND AN INFORMED ELECTORATE IS THE BEDROCK OF DEMOCRACY,
THEN FOR THE GOOD OF THIS DIVIDED NATION I SAY BARACK OBAMA AND MITT ROMNEY SHOULD
EACH IMMEDIATELY GET THEIR OWN CABLE CHANNELS DEDICATED SOLELY TO THEIR ELECTION.
OH, THAT WAS QUICK.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
