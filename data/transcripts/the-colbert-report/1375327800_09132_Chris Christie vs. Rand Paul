IT WAS ON SALE AT SAFE WAY.
NOW, NEXT UP ON T.C.R., CHECK
OUT THE LATEST DUST-UP IN THE
REPUBLICAN RUMBLE BETWEEN CHRIS
CHRISTIE AND RAND PAULY.
WHEN LAST WE LOOKED THE ORIGINAL
JERSEY BOY RIPPED LIBERTARIANISM

THEY CAN GET RE-ELECTED.
>> Stephen: G.O.P.-EOWW!
WELL, ANY RESPONSE TO THAT,
RANDY PAUL, PAUL?

SO, FOLKS, WE WANT TO HEAR FROM
YOU.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE-AWAY.
TWEET US WITH THE HASH-TAG,
G.O.P., L.O.L., YOLO.
AND KEEP AN UMBRELLA HANDY
BECAUSE WITH ANY LUCK THIS
G.O.-BYESING CONTEST WILL
CONTINUE ALL THE WAY TO THE
