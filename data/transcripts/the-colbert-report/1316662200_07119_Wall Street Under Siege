>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
NATION, ALL WEEK WALL STREET HAS
BEEN UNDER SIEGE BY A PROTEST
CALLED "OCCUPY WALL STREET," A
SELF-DESCRIBED LEADERLESS
RESISTANCE MOVEMENT WHICH
INTENDS TO OCCUPY WALL STREET
FOR MONTHS.
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING NEW
YORKERS NEVER IGNORE, IT'S
PEOPLE SLEEPING IN A PARK.
THE PROTEST STARTED ON THE WEB
SITE AD BUSTERS, WHICH DECLARES
"ONCE THERE WE SHALL INCESSANTLY
REPEAT OUR ONE SIMPLE DEMAND
UNTIL BARACK OBAMA CAPITULATES."
AND WHAT IS THEIR ONE SIMPLE
DEMAND?
WELL, IN A BLOG POST ENTITLED
"HEY, PRESIDENT OBAMA, GET READY
FOR OUR ONE DEMAND," THEY STATE,
"WE WILL BEAT OUR DRUMS, CHANT
OUR SLOGANS AND THEN WE'LL GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS AND HOLD
SEVERAL PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLIES TO
DECIDE WHAT OUR ONE DEMAND WILL
BE."
I PREDICT THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY
WILL DEMAND THE HACKY SACK
BELONG TO EVERYONE IN THE HEMP
FIBER UNIVERSE.
SO TODAY I SENT A CAMERA CREW TO
FILM THE FABULOUS FURRY FREAK
SHOW AND FIND OUT JUST WHAT
THESE MOON UNITS ARE DEMANDING
THROUGH THEIR CLOUDS OF BONG
SMOKE.
JIMMY, TEAR ME OFF A PIECE OF
MINDLESS HIPPIE ARGLE-BARGLE.
>> WE WANT POLITICAL MONEY TO BE
CLEAN MONEY.
WE DON'T WANT CORPORATIONS
DONATING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY
TO POLITICIANS THEN WHEN THEY
GET ELECTED ENACTING THE WILL OF
THOSE CORPORATIONS.
>> STEPHEN: NO, JIMMY, CRAZY
STUFF, DRUG-ADDLED COMMUNE
DWELLERS WHO DON'T KNOW POLITICS
FROM PATCHOULI.
>> IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN
THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE AN
ADEQUATE VOICE, WE NEED TO MAKE
SURE IT'S NOT BEING DROWNED OUT
BY THE FACT THAT WE DON'T
NECESSARILY HAVE MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A
CANDIDATE.
>> STEPHEN: HE MAKES A GOOD
POINT.
OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE... NO, GOD
DAMMIT.
JIMMY, I WANT A LIBERAL, SOME
NUT JOB IN A BURLAP SACK WITH A
SQUIRREL HAT AND GOGGLES THAT
DOES PERFORMANCE ART AND PUPPET
SHOWS IN THE SUBWAY.
>> I GUESS ONE REASON I DO
PERFORMANCE ART, PUPPET SHOWS IN
THE SUBWAY AND ON THE STREETS,
IS BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY HOPE AT ALL FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: LIBERALS.
THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED.
LUCKILY THEY ARE BECAUSE ON
SATURDAY POLICE BOOKED A
28-YEAR-OLD MAN FOR LOITERING
AND WEARING A MASK.
IT TURNS OUT NEW YORK HAS A LAW
PASSED IN 1845 BANNING MASKED
GATHERINGS.
AS IT SHOULD, FOLKS, PEOPLE IN
MASKS SHOULD NOT BE ON WALL
STREET.
LESSONS FOR ONE OF THOSE "EYES
WIDE SHUT" SEX PARTIES.
NOW WHY DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE
MASKS ON IN THE FIRST PLACE?
I WANT TO KNOW, WHAT ARE THEY
HIDING?
BECAUSE A MASK IS JUST A LIE YOU
WEAR ON YOUR FACE.
THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER ALWAYS
SAID.
WHICH IS WHY EVERY HALLOWEEN I
WENT DRESSED AS A SAD BOY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
