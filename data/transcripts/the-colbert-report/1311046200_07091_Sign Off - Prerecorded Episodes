>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT IS IT FOR THE REPORT.
JOIN ME TOMORROW FOR AN EXCITING NEW EPISODE UNLESS THIS IS A THURSDAY.
I CAN'T BE SURE WHAT DAY IT IS BECAUSE I PRERECORDED ALL OF THESE EPISODES IN OCTOBER
OF 2005 IN A 96 HOUR NEWS BINGE.
AND SINCE THEN THEY'VE JUST BEEN PLUGGING IN RANDOM NEWS ITEMS WHEN I COVER MY MOUTH.
