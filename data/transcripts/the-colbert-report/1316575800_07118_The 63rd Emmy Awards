>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, HAVE A SET.
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, THIS WEEKEND
WAS THE EMMYS AND WE WON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, WE WON LAST YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
WE WON LAST YEAR AND WE ALSO WON
THREE YEARS AGO FOR WRITING.
AND IT IS A GREAT FEELING THAT
DOES NOT LAST.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT ANYWAY, I JUST WANT TO SAY I
AM HAPPY FOR MY FRIENDS OVER AT
"THE DAILY SHOW."
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUYS.
WHAT REALLY UPSETS ME THIS YEAR
IS THAT ONCE AGAIN I WAS
OVERLOOKED BY THE EMMYS
IMMEMORIUM REEL.
WHAT DOES IT TAKE?
(LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY, CLIFF ROBERTSON?
BARBARA BILLINGSLEY AND JAMES
ARNESS?
THEY HAVE NOT WORKED IN YEARS!
GOD I HOPE I GET ON THAT THING
BEFORE JON STEWART DOES.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT WHAT REALLY ENRAGED ME WAS
ALL THE BRITISH PEOPLE TOUCHING
AMERICA'S GOLDEN LADY.
AND BY BRITISH, OF COURSE, I
MEAN ANYONE WITH AN ACCENT.
(LAUGHTER)
KATE WINSLET, GUY POOERS, MAGGIE
SMITH AND, MOST BRITISH OF ALL,
THE CREATOR OF "DOWNTOWN ABBEY"
JULIAN FELLOWES.
>> AT THE RISK OF BEING
GRANDILOQUENT, I WOULD LIKE TO
THANK YOU, THE AMERICAN
INDUSTRY.
>> Stephen: WELL, AT THE RISK OF
BEING GRANDILOQUENT, GO
FORNICATE YOURSELF YOU
WICKET-SNIFFING MASH BANGER!
AMERICA INVENTED T.V., BUDDY!
WE GET THE AWARDS FOR IT.
AND LOOK WHO HE WON FOR!
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLIP OF
MASTERPIECE THEATER'S "DOWNTOWN
ABBEY" RIGHT HERE.
>> PARDON ME, DO YOU HAVE ANY
GREY POUPON?
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
