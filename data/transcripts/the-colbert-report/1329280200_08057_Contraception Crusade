(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SOMETIMES... YOU HAVE TO LET
THEM LOVE YOU SOMETIMES.
FOLKS, I HAVE OFTEN WARNED YOU
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS AN
ANTIRELIGIOUS ZEALOT WHICH IS
SURPRISING SINCE HE IS ALSO A
DEVOUT SECRET MUSLIM.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW HE IS LAUNCHING A VENGEFUL
CRUSADE AGAINST THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH WHICH IS ESPECIALLY
HURTFUL SINCE VENGE FULL
CRUSADES-- KIND OF OUR THING.
JIM?
>> LAST MONTH THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION SAID THE NEW
HEALTH CARE LAW REQUIRES
RELIGIOUS HOSPITALS, COLLEGES,
AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO
INCLUDE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE
IN THEIR INSURANCE PLANS.
>> Stephen: TRANSLATION: OBAMA
IS FORCING PRIESTS TO HANDOUT
CONDOMS AT MASS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I AM OUTRAGED AS A CATHOLIC.
NO, NO, I AM OUTRAGED AS THE
CATHOLIC.
(LAUGHTER)
I AM SORRY, POABD, BUT YOU LOST
MY RESPECT IN 2010 WHEN YOU CAME
OUT IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH
CARE.
I SAY IF JESUS WANTED EVERYONE
TO HAVE INSURANCE HE'D HAVE BEEN
CRUCIFIED ON A BLUE CROSS/BLUE
SHIELD.
(LAUGHTER)
AND ILL PAPA DID NOT SCORE ANY
POINTS WITH ME FOR SHOWING UP AT
THE GRAMMYS WITH NICKI MENAJ.
(LAUGHTER)
I TELL YOU, FOLKS.
THERE IS NOTHING WE AMERICAN
CATHOLICS ENJOY MORE THAN
DEFENDING THE CHURCH'S STANCE ON
CONTRACEPTION.
IT'S A CENTRAL TENET OF OUR
FAITH.
AS DEEPLY HELD IN OUR BELIEF IN
MARBLE, JESUS ON SNACK FOOD AND
UNINTENTIONALLY HOT SCHOOL
UNIFORMS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW THROUGH THE 1968 PAPAL
ENCYCLICAL CAL HUMANAE VITAE THE
CHURCH TEACHES US THAT THE
TRANSMISSION OF LIFE IS A
SERIOUS ROLE IN WHICH MARRIED
PEOPLE COLLABORATE FREELY AND
RESPONSIBLY WITH GOD.
YOU SEE, TO CATHOLICS SEX ISN'T
TWO DRUNK STRANGERS GETTING
THEIR FREAK ON AT CLOSING TIME.
IT'S THE MYSTICAL UNION OF TWO
PEOPLE INSPIRED TO CREATE NEW
PHYSICAL LIFE WHILE GOD ADDS A
SOUL IN A DIVINE AND EF-ABLE,
BEAUTIFUL THREE WAY.
SO WHEN YOU USE CONTRACEPTIONS,
YOU ARE NOT ONLY SINNING, YOU
ARE COCK-BLOCKING THE ALMIGHTY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I GOT GOD'S BACK ON THIS ONE.
BUT CATHOLIC BISHOPS ARE
ESPECIALLY ANGRY BECAUSE PAYING
FOR CON CONTRACEPTIVES
CONTRADICTS A BELIEF THAT THOSE
BISHOPS HOLD DEAR: THAT
CATHOLICS DON'T USE BIRTH
CONTROL.
WHICH ISN'T EASY BECAUSE 98% OF
CATHOLIC WOMEN USE BIRTH
CONTROL.
(LAUGHTER)
THE OTHER 2% ARE NUNS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, I KNOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING
IF I, STEPHEN COLBERT, PRACTICE
BIRTH CONTROL.
YES, I DO.
I PRACTICE NATURAL
CHURCH-APPROVED BIRTH CONTROL.
IT'S LIKE HOLDING IN A SNEEZE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AH AH, AH, OH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'LL KEEP PRACTICING.
I'LL GET IT ONE DAY.
NOW, SOME IN THE LIBERAL
COMPLAIN-O-SPHERE ARE SAYING IF
YOU HAVE YOU TAKE TAXPAYER MONEY
YOU HAVE TO TAKE TAXPAYER RULES
AND, YES, THE CHURCH ACCEPTS A
LITTLE FEDERAL MONEY HERE AND
THERE.
IN 2010, CATHOLIC CHARITIES
RECEIVED $2.9 BILLION.
BUT THAT'S ONLY 62% OF THEIR
TOTAL REVENUE.
AFTER TAXES, THAT'S STILL 62%
BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY TAXES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND WHILE THAT MONEY CAME FROM
ALL OF THE TAXPAYERS, MOST OF
WHOM AREN'T CATHOLIC, ONCE THE
BISHOPS LAY THEIR HANDS UPON
THAT SECULAR CASH, IT'S RAN THE
SUBSTANTIATED INTO BISHOP BUCKS.
(LAUGHTER)
THE CASH FLOW OF CHRIST.
WHICH MEANS THE MONEY NOW HOLDS
THE BELIEF OF THE CATHOLIC
HIERARCHY AND CAN BE SPENT ONLY
ON ITEMS APPROVED AT THE HIGHEST
LEVELS.
LIKE MASSIVE LEGAL SETTLEMENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FORTUNATELY, FOLKS,
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT TAKING THIS
CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE LYING
DOWN.
OR EVEN DOGGIE-STYLE.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> THIS ATTACK BY THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
IN OUR COUNTRY MUST NOT STAND
AND WILL NOT STAND.
>> THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GET TO
DECIDE FOR RELIGIOUS PEOPLE WHAT
THEIR RELIGIOUS BRIEFS ARE.
>> THIS PRESIDENT IS ATTACKING
RELIGION AND IS PUTTING IN PLACE
A SECULAR AGENDA THAT OUR FORE
FOUNDERS WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE.
>> YES, OUR FORE FOUNDERS WOULD
NOT RECOGNIZE THIS SECULAR
AGENDA ANY MORE THAN WE
RECOGNIZE THE TERM
"FOURFOUNDERS."
AND THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT USE
CONTRACEPTION OR BEN FRANKLIN
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO RIDDLED
WITH SYPHILIS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AS... IT'S A ADD STORY.
IT'S TRUE.
SAD.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT BACK THEN.
JUST A TINCTURE OF MERCURY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AS MY FELLOW CATHOLIC RICK
SANTORUM POINTS OUT, THIS PUTS
US ON A SLIPPERY-- NAY,
LUBRICATED SLOPE-- TO TIERNEY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: YOU MARGINALIZE
FAITH IN AMERICA.
WHEN YOU REMOVE THE PILLAR OF
GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS, THEN WHAT'S
LEFT?
IT'S THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
WHAT'S LEFT IS FRANCE BECAME THE
GUILLOTINE.
>> Stephen: YES, HERE'S
COVERING COPAYS FOR BIRTH
CONTROL.
HERE'S BEHEADING.
IT'S THAT CLOSE!
SO IF CATHOLIC INSTITUTIONS--
LIKE MYSELF-- ARE GOING TO BE
FORCED TO PROVIDE
CONTRACEPTIVES, I THINK WE
BETTER BE SURE PEOPLE ARE USING
THEM THE WAY OBAMA WANTS!
NATION, THIS IS YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS-- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
AREN'T FAMILIAR-- IS
CONTRACEPTION.
ALL RIGHT?
I HAVEN'T USED ONE OF THESE IN A
WHILE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY.
THERE YOU GO.
AND THIS IS OBAMA'S ATTACK ON
RELIGION.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: HAS L OF THE!
MA ZELL OF THE!
THAT TASTES LIKE FREEDOM!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
