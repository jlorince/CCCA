(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, FOLKS, IT'S NO
SECRET.
WE ALL KNOW THE MEDIA IS
LIBERAL.
THAT'S WHY THEY SHOW US ONLY
KATIE COURIC'S COLONOSCOPY
AND NOT SEAN HANNITIES.
RELEASED TAPES.
I WANT TO SEE THE CHUNKS OF
COLMES HE'S GOT STUCK IN
THERE FOLKS, ANY TIME A
CONSERVATIVE FIGURE IS IN
TROUBLE, THE MEDIA WHIPS
ITSELF INTO A FEEDING
FRENZY.
SO IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER
INSTALLMENT OF BLOOD IN THE
WATER.
(APPLAUSE)
>> SHARK SHARK.
SHARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THE
LATEST REPUBLICAN FOUND
BOBBING IN A POOL OF HIS OWN
CHUM IS TEXAS STATE
REPRESENTATIVE LARRY TAYLOR
WHO IS BEING ATTACKED JUST
BECAUSE AT A HEARING LAST
THURSDAY HE HAD HARSH WORDS
FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO
DIDN'T PAY THE CLAIMS OF
DISASTER VICTIMS IN A TIMELY
MANNER.
>> YOUR JOB IS TO PAY THE
CLIENTS.
DON'T NITPICK, DON'T TRY TO
JEW THEM DOWN-- .
>> Stephen: YES.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT'S PROBABLY A BAD TERM.
I MEAN COME ON, THIS IS THE
21st CENTURY.
IF A REPUBLICAN WANTS TO
CRITICIZE IN A WAY THAT'S
ACCEPTABLE, DON'T SAY JEW
THEM DOWN.
SAY MUSLIM THEM DOWN.
OR GAY THEM UP.
OR MEXICAN THEM SIDEWAYS.
NOW FOLKS, I WANT TO BE
CLEAR HERE.
I AM NOT DEFENDING WHAT
REPRESENTATIVE TAYLOR SAID.
BUT THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE
MEDIA TO PILE ON HIM LIKE A
BUNCH OF CHEER KEYS ON A
BOTTLE OF FIRE WATER WHICH
IS A PHRASE I REGRET USING.
NOW I WOULD JUST LIKE TO
POINT OUT, I WOULD LIKE TO
POINT OUT HOW QUICKLY TAYLOR
CORRECTED HIMSELF, JIM?
>> YOUR JOB TO PAY THE
CLIENT, DON'T NITPICK, DON'T
TRY TO JEW THEM DOWN
OR-- THAT'S PROBABLY A BAD
TERM.
>> Stephen: NOW TO ANALYZE,
HOW TAYLOR RESPONDED JUST SO
FAST.
LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE
BIGOT-O-TRON 9,000.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE
BIGOT-O-TRON 9000 WHERE
NOTHING IS BLACK AND WHITE.
IT'S NEGRO AND CRACKER.
NOW FOLKS, LARRY TAYLOR WILL
BE REPRESENTED BY THIS PHOTO
OF HIM.
NOW SCIENCE TELLS US THAT
THE BRAIN HAS TWO LOBES.
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN
HOUSES THE ETHNIC STEREOTYPE
LOBE WHILE THE LEFT SIDE OF
THE BRAIN CONTAINS THE
KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A
CAMERA POINTED AT HIM.
APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO
SIDES WAS AT SOME POINT
SEVERED.
(LAUGHTER)
ONE IMAGINES DURING AN
INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT WHERE
LET'S SAY A SAW BLADE WENT
OUT OF CONTROL AND
PENETRATED HIS SKULL CUTTING
THE CORPOS COLOSSUM SO WHEN
HE SAID THE PROBABLY BAD
TERM "JEW HIM DOWN" OVER
HERE, THIS SIDE DIDN'T KNOW
AND COULD NOT STOP IT FROM
EMERGING FROM HIS MOUTH,
WHEREUPON IT ENTERED HIS
LEFT EAR, THUS TRIGGERING
THE MEDULA-I-[BLEEP]-UP-ALLOTTA.
>> ALSO, ALSO I KNOW HOW TO
DRAW SNOOPY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND THAT IS THE MIRACLE OF
BIOLOGY.
TAYLOR HAS SINCE ISSUED A
WRITTEN APOLOGY SAYING I
INADVERTENTLY USED A PHRASE
THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND
OFFENSIVE.
I REGRET MY POOR CHOICE OF
WORDS.
YOU SEE, HE INADVERTENTLY
USED A PHRASE THAT MANY
PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE.
MEANING THAT SOME PEOPLE
ENJOY THAT PHRASE, AND HE
SIMPLY ASSUMED HE WAS
TALKING TO THOSE PEOPLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO GET OFF HIS BACK, MEDIA.
THE LESS ON HERE IS WE ALL
JUST NEED TO BE MORE
SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT
SOME OLD ETHNIC SLURS ARE NO
LONGER ACCEPTABLE.
SO YOU CAN'T SAY DON'T MAKE
ME GO DUTCH.
OR DON'T WELCH ON A BET.
OR GIVE ME A BRAZILIAN.
