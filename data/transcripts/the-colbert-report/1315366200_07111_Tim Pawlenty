(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE.
I ASSUME HE'LL BE WEARING SWEAT
ABOUTS, EATING A TUB OF CHERRY
GARCIA.
PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR TIM
PAWLENTY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS SO MUCH COMING ON,
GOVERNOR.
>> HAPPY TO DO IT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU GET THAT
KIND OF RECEPTION?
IOWA?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: OH, WELL... NOW
SIR, CAN I CALL YOU T-PAW.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: IT MIGHT BE MORE
FITTING TO CALL YOU GOVERNOR
PAW.
>> WHERE IS THAT'S FINE, TOO.
>> Stephen: SIR, YOU RECENTLY
DROPPED OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
RACE.
FORMER GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA,
PROMISING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE.
NOW YOU'RE OUT.
WHY DID YOU DROP OUT AFTER AMES?
>> I WAS OUT OF MONEY.
I CAME IN THIRD PLACE BEHIND
MICHELE BACHMANN AND RON PAUL.
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ANY
ONE PERSON TO ENDURE.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: NICELY DONE.
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE OUT OF
MONEY MAKES YOU RELATABLE TO SO
MANY AMERICANS RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S LIKE ME, THEY SAY.
SO YOU CAME IN THIRD WITH 2,293
VOTES, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> ALL RIGHT, AND THE GUY WHO
CAME IN SIXTH, PERRY, HAD 718
VOTES.
NOW HE'S NUMBER ONE.
YOU WERE NUMBER THREE.
HE WENT FROM SIX TO ONE, YOU
COULD HAVE GONE FROM THREE TO
NEGATIVE TWO WHICH I THINK MEANS
YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY PRESIDENT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: COULD YOU NOT HAVE
GOTTEN A BANK LOAN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, WE WANT TO DO THIS AT A
LEVEL THAT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.
WE DIDN'T WANT TO SURVIVE, WE
WANTED TO WIN.
THIS IS TAKING ON MORE AND MORE
OF A REALITY T.V. SHOW
COMPONENT, THESE RACES.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE NOT JUST
MONEY BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE AN
ENTERTAINMENT COMPONENT TO IT.
SO I BROUGHT FORWARD A RECORD, A
SERIOUS POLICY APPROACH AND AT
LEAST IN THAT MOMENT IN TIME
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
ELSE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU THINK
ABOUT LEARNING TO JUGGLE?
>> I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT SHOOTING
SPARKS UP MY BUTT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: I WOULD VOTE FOR
THAT!
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
WHEN YOU WERE ACTUALLY RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT WOULD YOU HAVE
GIVEN ME THAT ANSWER?
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU SHOULD
HAVE PULLED THAT ONE OUT DURING
ONE OF THE DEBATES.
WHEN I FIRST HEARD YOU USE THE
TERM OBONNEY CARE.
I LOVED IT.
WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY OBOMNEYCARE
I THOUGHT "HE HAS FOUND THE ONE
RING OF POWER.
HE HAS PULLED EXCALIBUR FROM THE
STONE."
THEN IN THE DEBATE THE MODERATOR
PUSHED EXCALIBUR AGAINST
ROMNEY'S CHEST AND SAID "WOULD
YOU CARE TO PUSH IT IN?"
AND YOU DIDN'T.
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUSH IT IN AND
PULL IT OUT AND BATHE YOURSELF
THE FOUNT OF HIS WARM BLOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT STOPPED YOU?
>> THE ELECTORATE HAS ALREADY
FACTORED IN GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S
APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE.
I WANTED TO FOCUS ON PRESIDENT
OBAMA IN THAT DEBATE.
IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO
NOT CONTRAST WITH MID, I DID
BRING IT UP IN THE SECOND
DEBATE.
THAT IS ISN'T WHAT COST ME MY
POSITION IN THE RACE, NO.
>> Stephen: IT WAS THE CASH.
>> I WENT ALL THE WAY FROM 1% TO
1%.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE STEADY.
THAT'S STEADY LEADERSHIP.
IF YOU NEED MONEY YOU KNOW THAT
I HAVE A SUPER PAC, RIGHTING?
>> YEAH, WE DID COME OUT A
LITTLE SHORT.
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU, CAN THE
COLBERT SUPERPAC HELP MY
CAMPAIGN?
>> Stephen: NOT... WELL, I
COULD HAVEN'T HELPED YOU WHILE
YOU WERE A CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE LEGALLY WE CAN'T...
>> WHAT ABOUT NOW?
>> Stephen: NOW WE'RE JUST TWO
GUYS TALKING.
>> YEAH.
YOU KNOW A GUY.
>> Stephen: YOU NEED SOME
MONEY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WERE TO JUMP BACK IN THE
RACE, WE COULDN'T EVER HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION AGAIN.
BUT I'M JUST TELLING YOU RIGHT
NOW, I LIKE THIS TIM PAWLENTY
GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, YOU DID USE OUR LOGO,
OUR ORIGINAL PAC IN YOUR
SUPERPAC.
>> Stephen: YOUR PAC WAS THE
INSPIRATION FOR MY PAC.
>> WHERE IS I KNOW BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO SHOW ME SOME LOVE FOR
THAT.
YOU STOLE THE LOGO.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: I... YOU KNOW
WHAT?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL SEE
YOU IN HELL.
(LAUGHTER).
(APPLAUSE)
MINNESOTA KNIGHT VERSUS NEW YORK
KNIGHT.
LET'S MAKE NEWS.
IS THERE SOMEONE YOU WOULD LIKE
TO ENDORSE IN THE 2012 RACE?
>> YOU.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT RUNNING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M NOT RUNNING.
I'M MORE LIKE SARAH PALIN.
I'M A TELEVISION PERSONALITY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT IS THE ISSUE THAT YOU THINK
IS GOING TO DEFINE THE RACE FROM
HERE ON OUT?
>> MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE MOST
CONCERNED ABOUT JOBS AND THE
ECONOMY.
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MAIN
THING.
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE A
JOBS PLAN?
>> I DID.
THE ONLY SPECIFIC ONE IN THE
RACE.
NOBODY CARED.
>> Stephen: AND NOW YOU DON'T
HAVE A JOB.
(LAUGHTER)
GOVERNOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
GOVERNOR TIM "T-PAW" PAWLENTY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
