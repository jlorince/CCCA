[LAUGHTER]
NATION, IN THIS ECONOMY, IT'S
NEVER A BAD IDEA TO KEEP YOUR
RESUME OUT THERE.
FOR EXAMPLE, I HEAR THE WHITE
HOUSE IS LOOKING FOR A NEW
FOUR-STAR GENERAL.
AS FOR ME, MY SAFETY JOB IS
ASTRONAUT.
YESTERDAY I SHOWED YOU MY JOB
INTERVIEW WITH NASA COMMANDER
STEVE LINDSAY.
THANK GOD DEVO LEFT THAT
JUMPSUIT BEHIND.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, TONIGHT I BEGIN MY
ASTRONAUT TRAINING, SO KICK OFF
YOUR MOON BOOTS AND PREPARE FOR
LIFTOFF OF PART TWO OF STEPHEN
COLBERT'S FALLBACK POSITION.
♪ HALLELUJAH ♪♪
I WAS READY TO SHOW NASA MY
RIGHT STUFF.
FIRST UP, I FAMILIARIZED MYSELF
WITH THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE
STATION TRAINING MODULES.
LET'S HIT THE ANTI-GRAVITY AND
FLOAT AROUND A LITTLE BIT.
READY?
ON THREE.
I'LL JUMP YOU HIT IT.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.
>> Stephen: NOPE, LET'S NOT.
>> THAT IS...
>> Stephen: NOPE DON'T TELL
ME.
>> CAN YOU GUESS?
>> Stephen: HOLD ON.
LET ME SEE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT IS A BATHROOM, RIGHT?
>> THAT WAS MY SLEEP STATION.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW.
ARE THERE ANIMALS UP THERE AT
ALL, ANY ANIMALS IN SPACE?
>> WE BRING INVERTEBRATES AND
VERT OPERATES INTO SPACE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT
ANIMALS?
>> ON MY MISSION WE HAD SPIDERS
IN SPACE.
>> Stephen: SPACE SPIDERS?
>> SPACE SPIDERS.
>> Stephen: NEXT, WORKING IN
SIMULATED ZERO G.
>> THE LAST TIME I LET MAN PUT
ME IN HARNESS, WE HAD A SAFE
WORD, SO LET'S CALL IT PUMPKIN
PATCH.
IS THIS HOW THEY TRAIN FOR
"DANCING WITH THE STARS"?
>> GO COUNTER-CLOCKWISE, LEFTY
LOOSEY.
PUSH THAT.
YEP.
>> Stephen: IS THERE THIS MUCH
PLYWOOD IN SPACE?
>> THAT'S A TYPICAL ELECTRONICS
UNIT.
>> Stephen: BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
>> NEVER LET GO WITH BOTH HANDS.
>> Stephen: PUMPKIN PATCH.
PUMPKIN PATCH.
OF COURSE, PHYSICAL FITNESS IS
KEY.
SO I WAS OFF TO MEET MY
NAMESAKE, THE COLBERT TREADMILL,
TO LEARN HOW ASTRONAUTS EXERCISE
IN SPACE.
THERE'S MY GIRL.
>> WE HAVE HARNESS FOR YOU TO
PUT ON.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
IT'S A STRAPON?
>> YEP.
>> Stephen: COOL.
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
LET'S DO IT.
I HAVE TO BE HARNESSED INTO MY
TREADMILL ON EARTH, TOO.
BECAUSE I HATE RUNNING.
♪♪
♪♪
>> SO THAT'S A SUMMARY OF WHAT
YOU JUST DID.
>> Stephen: WORKOUT TIME, 2.6
MINUTES.
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT FOR ME.
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT I DO.
THEN IT WAS TIME FOR SIMULATED
JET PACK TRAINING BY SITTING IN
A CHAIR THAT UTILIZES THE LATEST
IN AIR HOCKEY TECHNOLOGY.
MY GRANDMOTHER HAS ONE OF THESE
FOR GETTING UP AND DOWN THE
STAIRS.
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT FEEL MORE
LIKE I WAS IN SPACE IF THERE
WASN'T A GUY IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT
BEHIND ME.
[APPLAUSE]
AND, OF COURSE, I HAD TO TEST
DRIVE MY MOON WHEELS.
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS BABY?
>> THE ORIGINAL NAME OF THE
ROVER WAS THE THREAD, AND THEN
THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE SAID LOSE
THE NAME FRED, SO THEN IT BECAME
OTHER THINGS.
>> Stephen: CAN I NAME IT THE
CARL?
IT CAN BECOME THE CARL ROVER.
NO?
>> WANT THE TAKE A LOOK INSIDE?
>> Stephen: SO THIS USES A
STICK?
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT AM I DOING?
>> THAT'S THE EMERGENCY STOP.
>> Stephen: SHOULD I NOT TURN
THIS OR SHOULD I NOT TURN THIS?
>> DON'T TURN IT.
>>
>> Stephen: MIND IF I PUT THAT
UP THERE?
>> NOT AT ALL.
>> Stephen: A LITTLE
ASTRONAUTY IN HERE.
WANT ME TO DRIVE?
>> SURE.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.
NOW LET'S GO TOWARDS THE MARS
HILL.
>> Stephen: SO WE ARE ON MARS.
>> THEN WE'LL GO NICE AND SLOW
DOWN THIS LITTLE CRATER.
>> Stephen: WHOA.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW DOES THIS SYSTEM RESPONDED
TO PRESENCE OF VOMIT?
I HAD MASTERED EVERY DISCIPLINE
OF SPACE TRAVEL.
ALL THIS WAS LEFT WAS TO LIGHT
THAT BIG CANDLE.
TUNE IN NEXT TIME WHEN I FACE
SPACE DANGER.
>> WHAT'S UP?
>> Stephen: WHAT DID WE LOSE?
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LAND
