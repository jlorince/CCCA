(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS, I'M
GOING TO TELL YOU, WHEN I HEAR
YOU PEOPLE CHANTING MY NAME, YOU
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT
BECAUSE I HAVE GOT HUGE BREAKING
NEWS.
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SIT DOWN
TO HERE THIS.
IF YOU'RE ALREADY SITTING DOWN,
PLEASE STAND UP AND THEN SIT
DOWN AGAIN.
ARE YOU RESEATD?
GOOD.
BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SHOCKING
NEWS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S
DECEMBER 27 DEBATE.
>> I'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE IN
MY EAR TELLING ME THAT WE'VE
BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM DONALD
TRUMP IS OUT.
HE'S FIRED HIMSELF, HE'S NOT
GOING TO MODERATE THAT DEBATE
DECEMBER 27.
>> ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
I'VE GOT FOUR PEOPLE IN MY EAR,
I'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE IN MY LUNGS
AND ONE GUY CRAWLING UP MY ASS
TO TELL ME THE SAME THING.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THIS JUST IN.
I CAN CON NARPL THE DONALD THE
TRUMP HAS PULLED OUT OF HIS OWN
DEBATE THAT ALL BUT TWO OF THE
CANDIDATES HAD ALREADY PULLED
OUT OF.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THIS WILL BE HUGELY
EMBARRASSING FOR TRUMP IF THAT
WERE AN EMOTION HE WERE CAPABLE
OF FEELING.
NOW I ASSUME THE DATE CONFLICTED
WITH TRAMP'S ANNUAL FULL-BODY
GOLD LEAFING.
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE HAS CANCELED
FOR A MORE IMPORTANT REASON.
JIM?
>> IN A STATEMENT, TRUMP SAYS
HE'S PULLING OUT TO A AVOID A
CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE HE
WON'T RULE OUT INDEPENDENT RUNS!
>> THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY SAID THAT REALLY IT'S
INAPPROPRIATE AND HE SAID IT
FAIRLY STRONGLY AND I HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
IN FACT, THEY HAD THEIR BIGGEST
AND MOST SUCCESSFUL FUND-RAISER
AT MY CLUB IN WASHINGTON.
THEY SAID IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO
BE DOING THIS, TO BE HAVING THE
REPUBLICANS SHOW UP TO A DEBATE
WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS THE
MODERATOR IF DONALD TRUMP IS
GOING TO RUN OR EVEN POTENTIALLY
RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE.
>> Stephen: AS AN INDEPENDENT.
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, I THINK HE SHOULD RUN IN
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, ALTHOUGH
IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE IF HE
RAN AS A WIG.
(LAUGHTER)
HEY-O!
MICHAEL, PLEASE, THIS IS
IMPORTANT.
FOLKS, I WOULD BE LYING IF I
DIDN'T SAY I SAW THIS COMING.
DONALD TRUMP IS A FRIEND, HE'S
MY BEST FRIEND.
NUMBER ONE BEST GREATEST FRIEND
OF ALL TIME.
WE RACE YACHTS, WE TRADE
MISTRESSES, I CALL HIM TRUMP
CARD, HE CALLS ME COLD BEER.
THAT SAID, THE GUY'S A BOOB.
HE LOOKS LIKE A TAN JELL-O HAD
SEX WITH AN OLD DISH RAG.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE I
LOVE THIS MAN.
AND TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF TRUMP
MATTERING, IT IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVER THAT TONIGHT I
REANNOUNCE MY STEPHEN COLBERT'S
SOUTH CAROLINA SERIOUS CLASSY
REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT.
I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.
WE'VE SET THE DATE LATE TO
MID-JANUARY, MARK YOUR CALENDAR.
THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS INTEREST
SO FAR, HUGE MASSIVE PENDULOUS
INTEREST.
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT MY
DEBATE.
SALON, DAILY BEAST, NPR, THE
"PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER", PASS
MARK CIRCULAR.
(LAUGHTER)
AND NOW IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN
BIGGER THAN EVER WITH RICK
SANTORUM AND NEWT GINGRICH FREE
FROM THEIR COMMITMENT TO TRUMP.
YOU STILL HAVE A HOME IN MY
DEBATE, BOYS, I AM DELIGHTED
ABOUT NEWT.
I AM LESS DELIGHTED ABOUT
SANTORUM BUT STILL SOLID DELIGHT
ACROSS THE BOARD.
OKAY, NOW THE DEBATE IS GOING TO
BE ON A NEW NETWORK.
IT'S GOING TO BE ON ANIMAL
PLANET.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I AM GETTING... I AM GETTING
SOME HOT HEAT FROM NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC.
NAT GEO, NATTY G, THEY HAVE THE
MOST NATURAL SUN SCORCHED RACKS.
THE PRIMO NUMBER ONE CLASSIEST
TITTYS IN ANTHROPOLOGY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE VERY NICE.
THEY'RE VERY NICE.
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE ENTIRE
THING AT A ZOO IN THE POLAR BEAR
ENCLOSURE, LET THE POLAR BEAR
PICK THE WINNER.
ALL THE CANDIDATES GET PRE-RUBED
WITH SALMON.
THE FINEST SAY BARS, LOWER
PRICES.
