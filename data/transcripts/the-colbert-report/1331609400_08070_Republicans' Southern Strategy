TALK INTO THIS CAMERA.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, TOMORROW ARE THE BIG
GOP PRIMARIES IN ALABAMA AND
MISSISSIPPI.
THAT IS NOT JUST THE DEEP
SOUTH, THAT IS DIPPED IN
BATTER AND DEEP FAD FRIED
SOUTH.
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M A
LOYAL SON OF THE SOUTH.
YOU CAN TELL BY MY THICK
SOUTHERN ACCENT.
AND OF COURSE THE PARASOL I
CARRY TO PROTECT ME FROM THE
NOON DAY SUN, OR ELSE I DO
DECLARE I WILL GET A BRAIN
FEVER.
NOW DIX-YEAR LAND HAS BEEN A
REPUBLICAN BULWARK EVER
SINCE RICHARD NIXON'S
SOUTHERN STRATEGY IN 1968
WHEN NIXON WON BY APPEAL
TOLLING SOUTHERN
CONSERVATIVES BY STRESSING
STATE'S RIGHTS, LAW AND
ORDER AND A SOLID PLEDGE TO
HUNT DOWN THOSE DUKE BOYS.
SO ANY REPUBLICAN WITHOUT
WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT HAS TO
WOO US AND I'M DELIGHTED TO
SAY THAT WE'VE GOT THREE
VERY HANDSOME GENTLEMEN
CALLERS, ALONG WITH THAT
NICE OLD MAN WHO KEEPS
PROMISING US GOLD.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I LIKE THAT RICK
SANTORUM EVEN THOUGH HE'S
FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
BUT HOW CAN I RESIST A
GEORGIA PEACH LIKE NEWT
GINGRICH?
HE'S A SOUTHERNER BORN AND
RAISED, EXCEPT WHERE HE WAS
BORN AND RAISED.
AND MITT ROMNEY ALSO EXISTS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND MITT HAS JUST SAVED THE
GLOWING ENDORSEMENT OF THE
PREEMINENT CHRONICLER OF
SOUTHERN CULTURE, THE HEIR
TO WILLIAM FAULKNER,
MR. JEFF FOXWORTHY.
JAMES?
>> MITT ROMNEY WILL BE
CAMPAIGNING IN ALABAMA AND
MISSISSIPPI, WITH COMEDIAN
JEFF FOXWORTHY BY HIS SIDE.
>> M ITT IS THE RIGHT GUY
FOR THE JOB.
>> NOW IF YOU ARE'S A
MULTIMILLIONAIRE ENTERTAINER,
SUPPORTING THE CANDIDACY OF
A WEALTHY FINANCIER FROM
MASSACHUSETTS, YOU MIGHT NO
LONGER BE A REDNECK.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
AND FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
MITT'S NOT JUST WALKING THE
WALK HE'S DRAWALLING THE
TALK.
>> MORNING, Y'ALL.
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
I STARTED RIGHT WITH A
BISCUIT AND SOME CHEESY GRIT,
I'LL TELL YOU.
THIS IS A GUY FROM
MISSISSIPPI AND HIS NAME IS
GARRETT JACKSON.
THIS GUY IS WITH ME EVERY
SINGLE DAY, TAKES ME
EVERYWHERE I GO.
>> FOUR YEARS AT OLE MISS,
AND SO HE IS NOW TURNING ME
INTO AN, I DON'T KNOW, AN
UNOFFICIAL SOUTHERNER AND
I'M LEARNING TO SAY Y'ALL,
AND I LIKE GRITS.
AND THING -- STRANGE THINGS
ARE HAPPENING TO ME.
>> YES, STRANGE THINGS ARE
HAPPENING TO HIM.
BECAUSE BECOMING A
SOUTHERNER IS A LOT LIKE
PUBERTY.
YOUR VOICE CHANGES BEYOND
YOUR TESS TICKLES SECEDE
FROM THE NORTH-- TESTICLES
SECEDE FROM THE NORTH.
BUT NEWT-- BUT NEWT GINGRICH
WAS NOT GOING TO TAKE THAT
GRITS COMMENT LYING DOWN.
ALTHOUGH FROM THE LOOKS OF
HIM, HE HAS EATEN GRITS
LYING DOWN.
>> THE FIRST TIME HE HAD
EVER TASTED GRITS.
I JUST WANTED TO REASSURE
ALL OF YOU, THAT I HAVE HAD
SOME ACQUAINTANCE IN A
VARIETY OF FORMS, WHETHER
IT'S WITH SHRIMP, WITH
CHEESE, WITH GRAVY, I GET
IT.
>> OH, NEWT HAS THROWN THE
CHITLIN DOWN.
BUT I'M SURE MITT WILL PICK
IT UP BECAUSE HE'S NOT AWARE
