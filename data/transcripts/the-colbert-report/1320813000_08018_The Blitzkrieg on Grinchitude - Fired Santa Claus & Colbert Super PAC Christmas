(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!
PLERRY CHRISTMAS.
OHIO HO!
YES, FOLKS, THE BIG DAY IS RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST
CELEBRATE THE HOLIDAY.
THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON
GRINCHITUDE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
♪ HALLELUJAH... ♪
FOLKS, IN THIS BLEAK ECONOMY
CHRISTMAS MEANS MORE THAN EVER
OUR BEST HOPE TO FIX THE DEFICIT
IS FOR TIM GEITHNER TO ASK SANTA
FOR $14 TRILLION WORTH OF
SCARVES WITH GIFT RECEIPTS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT INSTEAD OF HELPING SANTA,
BUREAUCRATS OUT THERE ARE
STICKING THEIR BUDGET-CUTTING
FIVES INTO HIS BOWLFUL OF JELLY.
JIM?
>> FACED WITH DRASTIC BUDGET
SHORTFALLS SUFFOLK COUNTY NEW
YORK HAS LAID OFF SANTA.
DAVID McKEL HAS BEEN PLAYING THE
PART OF SANTA AT THE ST. JAMES
GENERAL STORE SINCE 2001.
THE STORE'S IS PARTIALLY FUNDED
BY SUFFOLK COUNTY AND DUE TO
BELT TIGHTENING THIS YEAR,
SANTA'S $6060 CONTRACT WAS
CANCELED.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: THEY FIRED SANTA!
HOW IS HE GOING TO BREAK THIS TO
MRS. CLAUSE?
OH, THEY'RE GOING TO BE EATING A
LOT OF VENISON THIS WINTER.
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S THE WORST PART, FOLKS...
IF YOU HAVE KIDS WATCHING GET
THEM OUT OF THE ROOM, OKAY?
THIS IS THE SECRET I'M ABOUT TO
GIVE OUT.
THIS GUY AT THE SUFFOLK COUNTY
GENERAL STORE, HE'S THE REAL
SANTA!
HOW DO WE KNOW?
BECAUSE HE FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR
II.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE COULD
HAVE BEATEN HITLER WITHOUT
SANTA?
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW WE TOOK THE
BEACHES ON D-DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, FRANKLY... FRANKLY,
FOLKS...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SANTA WITH MACHINE GUNS!
SANTA WITH MACHINE GUNS SHOOTING
THEM RIGHT DOWN GERI'S TOMB.
FRANKLY, I BELIEVE SANTA IS
BETTER OFF IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR
BECAUSE FOLKS, HE'S A JOB
CREATOR.
THAT'S WHY HE OUTSOURCED
EVERYTHING TO THE NORTH POLE.
HE DOESN'T WANT THE LABOR
DEPARTMENT ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT HIS SEASONAL MIGRANT
NON-UNION ELF LABORERS WHO,
LET'S BE HONEST, ARE PROBABLY
GUATEMALAN.
HARD TO TELL, THEY'RE ALL SO
SMALL.
THIS YEAR THERE WILL BE NO
CHRISTMAS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
UNLESS I SAVE IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO SUFFOLK COUNTY, COLBERT
SUPERPAC IS WILLING TO COVER
THAT $660.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S RIGHT, KIDS.
I SAVED CHRISTMAS AND ALL SANTA
HAS TO DO IS COME ON MY SHOW AND
SAY THAT CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND NOT NAUGHTY PEOPLE, NICE
