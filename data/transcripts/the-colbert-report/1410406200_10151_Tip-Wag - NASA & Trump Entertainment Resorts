OF COURSE, FOLKS, WE ALL KNOWTHE WORLD IS TOO COMPLICATED
TO SEE IN BLACK AND WHITE.
THAT'S WHY I SEE IT IN TIPAND WAG.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAGOF THE FINGER.
BOOM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(GONG)
FIRST UP, FOLKS, I AM A JUNKIEFOR ALL THINGS SPACE.
SO I WAS ON ORP COUD NINE WHEN IHEARD ABOUT THIS.
>> NASA ASTRONAUT WILL GETQUITE THE SWEET DEAL AT THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.BARRY WILMORE IS HEADED
THERE FOR SIX MONTHS ONSEPTEMBER 25th.
>> ASTRONAUT BARRY WILMOREASKED NASA, COULD YOU GET ME
THE NEW SEC NETWORK INSPACE?
THEY DID IT. HE'LL GET TOWATCH COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,ASTRONAUT BARRY WILMORE
CONVINCED NASA TO GET HIMCOLLEGE FOOTBALL FOR THE SIX
MONTHS HE'S ON THE SPACESTATION.
AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOING GETRECEPTION BECAUSE HE'S ONLY
ABOUT 40 FEET FROM THESATELLITE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT ANASTRONAUGHT WOULD WANT TO WATCH
FOOTBALL ON TV IN ORBIT,OTHERWISE THERE IS NOTHING
TO DO BUT GAZE AT THEMIRACLE OF GOD'S CREATION.
SO TONIGHT I'M GIVING A WAG OFMY FINGER TO NASA FOR OUT
MAN-CAVING EVERY OTHER SPORTSFAN ON EARTH.
COME ON!
OUR PIMPED OUT-- OUR PIMPEDOUT TESTOSTER-ROOMS THIS IS
HOW WE MEASURE OUR WORTH ASMEN.
I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD SET UPWITH MY 80 INCH FLAT SCREEN,
HASHMARKED CARPET, MY FRAMEDPHOTO OF THE GUY FROM THE
NUTRISYSTEM  COMMERCIALS.
THESE SHOW THE WORLD I WILLSPARE NO EXPENSE ON MY
GREATEST PASSION, SCREAMINGOBSCENITIES AT ATHLETES WHO
CANNOT HEAR ME.
BUT NOW NASA HAS GONE WHERENO MAN CAVE HAS GONE BEFORE.
OH, SOME GUY, THOUGHT HE WASA BIG SHOT WHEN HE DROPPED
$2 MILLION CONVERTING HISBASEMENT INTO THE BAT CAVE.
YOU'RE ADORABLE.
TRY $150 BILLION OVER 16YEARS AND IT'S STILL NOT
DONE.
THEY'RE WAITING ON THERUSSKIES TO DELIVER THE
BUDWEISER BILLIARD LAMP.
NASA'S ORBITAL BRO-PIT HERE HASIT ALL. IT'S GOT FLOOR TOCEILING
TO CEILING ELECTRONICS, IT'SGOT ZERO-G RECLINERS, AND
ASTRONAUT BARRY CAN DRINK ALLTHE BEER HE WANTS WITHOUT
HAVING TO GO TO THE BATHROOMBREAK  BECAUSE CAN JUST ME INTO
A VACUUM TUBE.
ALTHOUGH, ALTHOUGH, FULLDISCLOSURE, I HAVE DONE THAT
ON EARTH.
NEXT UP, NEXT UP, NATION, ASA CELEBRITY WHO HAS EARNED
YOUR TRUST BY BEING FAMOUS,I WORK HARD TO PROTECT MY
PERSONAL BRAND.
I SIMPLY CAN'T LET MY NAMEBE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW
QUALITY PRODUCTS.
I MEAN, SAY WHAT YOU WILLABOUT STEPHEN COLBERT'S
RAZOR SLINKY.
BUT IT WAS MADE FROM THEHIGHEST QUALITY RIBBON
BLADE.
AND WHEN IT COMES TODISCRIMINATING BRANDING, MY
HERO IS DONALD TRUMP OR THETRUMPEL.
HE LENDS HIS NAME ONLY TO ASELECT FEW LUXURIOUS
PRODUCTS.
SUITS, SHIRTS, NECK WARE,EYEWEAR, LEATHER GOODS,
LIGHTING, MATTRESSES, BOOKS,CHOCOLATE, WATER, COLOGNE,
MIRRORS.
THOUGH IT IS SHOCKING THATTRUMP WOULD LET A MIRROR OUT
OF HIS SIGHT.
SO PERSONALLY I LOVE HISLATEST POWER MOVE.
>> DONALD TRUMP IS SUING THETRUMP TAJ MAHAL AND TRUMP
PLAZA IN ATLANTIC CITY TOSTOP USING HIS NAME.
HE SAYS THEIR POOR CONDITIONIS HURTING HIS PERSONAL
BRAND.
>> IN A LAWSUIT FILED TUESDAYTHE BILLIONAIRE ACCUSED
TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTSOF VIOLATING ITS LICENSING
AGREEMENT BY ALLOWING THETRUMP TAJ MAHAL AND TRUMP
PLAZA TO FALL INTO AN UTTERSTATE OF DISREPAIR.
THE SUIT ALSO PONTS TONEGATIVE ON-LINE REVIEWS
FROM CUSTOMERS CALLING BOTHPROPERTIES A TRUMP DUMP.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
A TRUMP DUMP.
THAT'S AN INSULT AND ATRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT.
TRUMP DUMP IS ALREADYLICENCED TO DONALD'S LINE OF
LUXURY STOOL SOFTENERS.
GUARANTEED TO PROVIDE YOUWITH THE CLASSIEST, MOST
MAGNIFICENT PLATINUM GRADEVELVETY TOP SHELF DOO-DOO
POSSIBLE.
SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF THEFINGER TO THESE CASINOS FOR
TAKING THE TRUMP NAME INVAIN.
THEY CAN'T BLAME THESESUBTRUMP CONDITIONS ON
DONALD.
HE HASN'T HAD ANY REAL ROLEIN THESE CASINOS SINCE
RESIGNING AS CHAIRMAN OF THEBOARD IN 2009 WHEN HIS
GAMBLING COMPANY FILED FORBANKRUPTCY FOR THE THIRD
TIME.
NOT HIS FAULT.
IT IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULTTO MAKE MONEY IN THE
GAMBLING BUSINESS.
YOU SEE, DONALD TRUMP, HOLDON, THIS JUST IN OVER THE
TRUMP NEWSWIRE!
(APPLAUSE)
OH, HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
OH NO!
OH NO, YESTERDAY TRUMPENTERTAINMENT RESORTS FILED FOR
BANKRUPTCY AGAIN.
OH MY GOSH.
OH MY GOSH.
JUST SO, SO TRAGIC.
(LAUGHTER)(TOILET FLUSHING)
FOLKS --(TOILET NOISES)
I'M JUST GLAD DONALD TRUMP IS NOLONGER CONNECTED WITH
THESE TERRIBLE BRANDS.
HE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLEASSOCIATE THE NAME TRUMP
WITH SHABBY, OSTENTATIOUSHUSKS THAT HAVE CRUMBLED INTO
PARODIES OF THEMSELVES.
SURE BACK IN THE 80 EASETHEY HAD A MOMENT OF
RESPECTABILITY BUT NOWTHEY'RE WAY PAST THEIR
PRIME.
GETTING BY ON THEIR NAME ANDAPPEALING ONLY TO THE
CONFUSED AND THE ELDERLY.
BUT THERE IS JUST SO MUCHYOU CAN DO WITH A COLOURFUL
PAINT JOB AND A WEIRD GOLDENROOF.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
