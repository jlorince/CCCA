( LAUGHTER )NATION,YOU KNOW I LOVE DRONES.
THEY SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO OURENEMIES THAT WE WILL HUNT THEM
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, ASLONG AS WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
TAMPA.
( LAUGHTER )AND THESE DAYS, LIKE A CONVOY OF
S.U.V.s IN YEMEN, DRONES AREBLOWING UP.
SO IT'S TIME FOR MY LONG-RUNNINGDRONE APPRECIATION SEGMENT--
"STEPHEN COLBERT'S AUTO-ROBOTICFIXATION."
PEOPLE LOVE THIS SEGMENT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
PEOPLE HAVE LOVED THIS SEGMENTFOR YEARS.
FOLKS, FIRST UP, DRONES GET ABAD RAP AS CREEPY SURVEILLANCE
TOOLS THAT MONITOR OUR EVERMOVE.
GOOD NEWS-- NOW THEY'RE WATCHINGUS HAVE SEX.
IT'S ALL PART OF A NEW VIRALVIDEO CALLED "DRONE BONING."
JIM?
>> THERE'S THE SWEEPING DRONESHOT OF THE BEAUTIFUL VINEYARD,
AND THERE'S THE BONING!
AND HERE'S AN AERIAL SHOT OF ANABANDONED SEASIDE FORT, AND
BONING RIGHT UP THERE.
>> Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, ASTHE OLD SAYING GOES, I DON'T
KNOW MUCH ABOUT ART BUT I KNOWTHIS HAS PEOPLE HAVING SEX IN
IT.
AS ONE OF THE FILM'S DIRECTORSSO POETICALLY PUT IT, WOULDN'T
IT BE FUNNY TO HAVE THESESIMPLISTIC BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES
AND HAVE PEOPLE ( BLEEP ) INTHEM?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
FUNNY AND PROFOUND.
BECAUSE SIMPLISTIC BEAUTIFULLANDSCAPES WITH PEOPLE ( BLEEP )
IN THEM WAS GOD'S ORIGINALCONCEPT FOR EARTH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THE FILM'S DIRECTORS-- I AGREE.
I AGREE.
THE FILM'S DIRECTORS ARE ALREADYTALKING ABOUT A SEQUEL, I HOPE
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF BONEDRONING -- "AERIAL VENEREAL."
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, I HAVE ONLY ONE ISSUE
WITH THIS OSCAR-WORTHY PIECE OFBIRD'S-EYE PORN-- SOMEONE HAD TO
STEER THE DRONE OVER ALL THOSENAKED PEOPLE.
WOULDN'T IT BE COOLER IF DRONESCOULD FIND YOU HAVING SEX ON
THEIR OWN?
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK BECAUSEDARPA-FUNDED RESEARCHERS HAVE
TESTED A DRONE THAT CAN LEARNAND ACT ON ITS OWN.
THE DRONE PROVED IT COULD LEARNBY FLYING INTO A SERIES OF
UNFAMILIAR ROOMS IN WHICHSENSOR DATA FROM THE WALLS,
FURNITURE AND OTHER OBJECTSTRIGGERED IT TO REPORT IT WAS
IN A NEW SPACE AND CAUSED THEWAYS ITS NEURONS CONNECTED TO
ONE ANOTHER TO CHANGE IN A CRUDEMIMIC OF LEARNING IN A REAL
BRAIN.  AND THE NEXT TIME THECRAFT ENTERED SAME ROOM,
IT RECOGNIZED IT.
FOLKS, THIS WOULD BE AFOOL-PROOF PLAN TO GET THE
TERRORISTS, AS LONG AS THEYNEVER REDECORATE.
( LAUGHTER )DARPA, DARPA FUNDED THE RESEARCH
SO DRONES COULD MAKE SENSE OFVIDEO AND SENSOR DATA FOR
THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF ALWAYSHAVING TO BEAM IT DOWN TO
EARTH FOR ANALYSIS BY COMPUTERSOR HUMANS.
OH, WELL THAT'S GREAT.
THEN WE'RE OFF THE HOOK.
NOW IF WE ACCIDENTALLY BOMB AWEDDING, YOU CAN'T BLAME US.
IT WAS OUR SELF-AWARE FLYINGRUMBA'S DECISION.
FOLKS, AS MUCH AS THERE ISABSOLUTELY NO DOWN SIDE TO
ARMING MACHINES, RELEASING THEMINTO THE SKIES, AND LETTING THEM
DO WHAT THEY WANT, ONE THINGABOUT THIS GIVES ME PAUSE.
>> TESLA C.E.O. ELON MUSKSOUNDING THE ALARM OVER
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
>> ELON MUSK SAYS ARTIFICIALINTELLIGENCE IS THE BIGGEST
THREAT TO US ALL.
>> WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEWE ARE SUMMONING THE DEMON.
>> Stephen: OH, THAT ISRIDICULOUS.
THE ONLY WAY TO SUMMON THE DEMONIS TO DRINK THE BLOOD OF A LIVE
GOAT INSIDE A CANDLELITPENTAGRAM-- OR SO I AM TOLD.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
BUT, YOU KNOW, ELON MUSK IS ABILLIONAIRE.
HE MUST BE RIGHT.
SO TONIGHT I AM TAKING A STRONGSTAND AGAINST-- WHAT!
>> STEPHEN, STOP TALKING.
>> Stephen: FUTURE STEPHEN,WHAT'S WRONG?
>> EVERYTHING'S FINE.
THE FUTURE'S AWESOME.
HEY, MAN, WOULD YOU BY ANYCHANCE HAVE A STEEL MESH
COLANDER BACK THERE?
>> Stephen, OF COURSE, THAT'SHOW I STRAIN PASTA DURING
COMMERCIALS.
>> OH, THANK GOD!
IT BLOCKS THE SIGNALS OF THESURVEILLANCE DIODE.
>> Stephen: WHOSE SIGNAL?
>> THE AUTONOMOUS DRONEOVERLORDS WHO CONQUERED OUR
PLANET SHORTLY AFTER YOU FOOLSTAUGHT THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHEN
THEY'VE BEEN IN A ROOM BEFORE.
>> Stephen:  SO ELON WASRIGHT?
RIGHT!
I CALL HIM ELON.
HE'S A FRIEND.
DRONES ARE A DANGEROUS ANDMALEVOLENT FORCE--
>> SHHH!
WHENEVER YOU DENOUNCE THE DRONESHERE IN THE PAST, IN THE FUTURE,
THEY PUNISH ME.
THEY WHIP ME WITH LASER CHAINS.
OH, I'D BETTER GO.
I CAN FEEL THEM CRACKING THEGEOMETRIC INTERFERENCE PATTERN
OF THIS WILLIAMS-SONOMA PASTASTRAIRN.
>> Stephen: WAIT!
I NEED TO KNOW ONE THING-- INTHE FUTURE, IS THERE STILL
DRONE BONING?
>> STEPHEN THE ONLY WAY THEY LETUS HAVE SEX IS IF THEY CAN
WATCH.
IN THE FUTURE, THERE IS ONLYDRONE BONING.
AGGH! LASER CHAINS!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen: SO, LIKE I'VE
ALWAYS SAID, AUTONOMOUS DRONESARE GREAT.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, MYWATER IS BOILING, SO IT'S TIME
FOR A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
