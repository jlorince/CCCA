>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS LEAD SINGER
FOR THE GRAMMY MAGNET ROCKERS
COLDPLAY, WHOSE NEW ALBUM IS
CALLED MYLO XYLETO WHICH I
BELIEVE IS CREEK FOR MILEY
CYRUS.
PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS MARTIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HEY, CHRIS, NICE TO MEET YOU.
SIT DOWN THERE, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT.
>> IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: WELL, I UNDERSTAND
THAT.
NOW, IT'S KIND OF A MEETING OF
THE MINDS.
>> YES, SIR.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE A SEVEN-TIME
GRAMMY WINNER; I AM A ONE-TIME
GRAMMY WINNER.
>> I REMEMBER.
>> Stephen: YEAH, SO BETWEEN US
WE AVERAGE FOUR GRAMMYS.
>> IT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: RIGHT?
RIGHT?
>> THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR GRAMMY
IS MORE THAN THE WEIGHT OF
OUR SEVEN.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M
NOT GOING TO FIGHT YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
NOW SIR, CAN I GET MAD AT YOU
FOR A SECOND?
>> PLEASE, GO AHEAD.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
NOT AN AMERICAN, ARE YOU?
>> NO, SIR.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT AN
AMERICAN, OKAY.
YOU COME TO OUR COUNTRY.
YOU TOOK OUR GWYNETH.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO
TELL ME THAT THAT IS NOT A JOB
AN AMERICAN WANTED TO DO, OKAY.
SO GIVE US KEIRA KNIGHTLEY AND
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC.
YOU SOLD OVER 50 MILLION ALBUMS.
>> NO, NOT THE MILLION, JUST THE
50.
>> Stephen: JUST 50, THAT'S THIS
YEAR, THAT'S THIS YEAR, 50.
HOW DO YOU SELL THAT MANY ALBUMS
AND WIN SEVEN GRAMMYS AND STILL
BE CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVE?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S A NEAT TRICK.
>> BY NOT LOOKING AT HANDSOME
AS, YOU KNOW, RICKY MARTIN.
>> Stephen: HE'S A GOOD LOOKING
GUY THAT RICKY MARTIN.
CHRIS MARTIN, RICKY MARTIN-- I
DON'T MIX YOU UP.
ON PAPER, IT'S VERY EASY.
>> I KNOW.
>> Stephen: IN PERSON, HEY,
LISTEN, I COULD GET LOST IN
THOSE BLUE EYES.
I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND WHY MS. PALTROW
FELL FOR YOU.
NOW, WE HAD RADIOHEAD ON HERE.
>> YES, I KNOW.
>> Stephen: A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
DID A FULL HOUR WITH THEM.
AND PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU'RE
INFLUENCED BY RADIOHEAD.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BUT I DON'T SEE IT.
>> WE ARE NOT AS GOOD MUSICALLY
BUT MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE.
>> Stephen: YES, VERY MUCH.
YOU HAVE SEEN HOW YOUR STANCE,
THIS KIND OF THING, LIKE THAT.
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.
>> YES, WE ALL IN BRITAIN HAVE
THIS KIND OF WRIGGLING DANCE.
>> Stephen: HERKY-JERKY QUALITY.
>> WE ARE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL
AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR US.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE A REAL
RIVAL WITH U2, YOU HAVE A LITTLE
RIVALRY GOING ON, DON'T YOU?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YEAH, YOU DO.
>> MY VOICE WENT UP, SO YEAH.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> I DON'T...
>> Stephen: ARE YOU LYING TO ME?
>> IN A WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IN A WAY I AM.
>> Stephen: WHO IS GOING TO BE
THE GLOBAL BAND OF THE FUTURE,
YOU OR U2?
>> THE JONAS BROTHERS.
>> Stephen: I SEE IT.
I COMPLETELY SEE IT.
THE NAME OF THE NEW ALBUM IS--
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT NAME?
>> WE TOOK IT FROM THE
RANDOMNESS OF THE UNIVERSE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: ARE YOU HIGH?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M 17% HIGH.
>> Stephen: WOW, YOU'VE GOT GOOD
CONTROL.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GUYS GOING
TO DO A SONG FOR US?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
>> OKAY, WE WILL.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO
TWIST YOUR ARM--
NO, NO, HE BLEW IT.
(LAUGHTER)
NO, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO BEG.
