EVERYBODY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, THERE ARE SO MANY AWFUL
STORIES IN THE NEWS RIGHT NOW,AND WITH CHAOS AND VIOLENCE
RAGING IN EVERY CORNER OF THEGLOBE, IT MAKES YOU WONDER,
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO AL QAEDA?
(LAUGHTER)TODAY, WE GOT AN ANSWER.
>> BREAKING OVERNIGHT, A NEWVIDEO FROM THE LEADER OF
AL QUAIDA.
>> ACCORDING TO THE VIDEOANNOUNCEMENT, AL QUAIDA IS
VOWING TO BRING ISLAMIC LAW TOINDIA.
>> THE HEAD OF AL QUAIDA SAYSHE'S OPENING A NEW BRANCH IN
INDIA.
>> STEPHEN: YES, AL QUAIDA'SOPENING A FRANCHISE IN INDIA.
(LAUGHTER)THEY'RE LIKE STARBUCKS, ONLY
WITH LESS AMBITIOUS PLANS FORGLOBAL DOMINATION.
(LAUGHTER)THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME FROM
LONGTIME AL QUAIDA LEADER ANDJIHADI SMURF AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI,
WHO RELEASED A VIDEO CALLING ONMUSLIMS ACROSS THE INDIAN
SUBCONTINENT TO JOIN THE"CARAVAN OF JIHAD."
THAT CARAVAN IS EASY TO SPOT --JUST LOOK FOR THE TRUCKS WITH 72
VIRGINS ON THE MUDFLAPS.
(LAUGHTER)LOOK, I GET WHY AL QUAIDA IS
OUTSOURCING TO INDIA -- THEY'REA GLOBAL TERROR ORGANIZATION.
THEY HAVE THEIR ONE TRUE PROPHETMARGINS TO THINK ABOUT, AND THEY
HAVE BEEN RUNNING ON ASHOESTRING BUDGET FOR SO LONG,
THEY'VE NEVER EVEN HAD ACHRISTMAS PARTY.
(LAUGHTER)BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON HERE.
>> I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TORECLAIM SOME MANTEL OF
LEADERSHIP HERE.
I.S.I.S. WAS KICKED OUT OFAL QAEDA FOR BEING TOO BRUTAL,
AND THEY'VE SORT OF TAKENTHE WORLD STAGE, AND EVERYONE'S
TALKING ABOUT THEM AND NO ONE'STALKING ABOUT AL QUAIDA, SO
THIS IS PROBABLY AT AN ATTEMPTTO REGAIN SOME NOTORIETY.
>> STEPHEN: OOH OOH, SOMEONE'SJEAL-OUS OF I.S.I.S.!
THEY'RE THE MYSTERIOUS NEW KIDIN TOWN AND EVERYONE'S TALKING
ABOUT HIM.
JUST LIKE KEVIN BACON INFOOTLOOSE.
ONLY I.S.I.S. WANTS TO OUTLAWDANCING -- AND BACON.
(LAUGHTER)I.S.I.S. IS THE "IT" JIHADY
GROUP RIGHT NOW.
THEY'VE GOT AN ENTIRE CALIPHATE,WHILE ALL OF AYMAN'S GUYS ARE
STILL DOING MONKEY BARS IN THEDESERT.
THAT'S NOT A LONG-TERM PLAN!
WHAT IF YOU TAKE OVER A CITYWITHOUT A JUNGLE GYM?
HOW WILL YOU GET AROUND?
WORSE, I.S.I.S. HAS TAKEN THELEAD IN THE ARENA MOST
ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPPRESSIVE17TH-CENTURY IDEOLOGUES,
YOUTUBE.
>> WE ALL REMEMBER THOSE GRAINYAMATEURISH VIDEOS THAT BIN LADEN
MADE THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SETUP BY SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING INLONG-WINDED ARABIC THAT NOBODY
IN THE WEST COULD UNDERSTAND.
NOW WE HAVE I.S.I.S. ON TWITTER,ON INSTAGRAM, ON WHAT'S APP,
THEY PRODUCE SLICK VIDEOS.
>> THEY'RE HIGHLY PRODUCED,THEY'VE GOT MUSIC, GRAPHICS, ALL
SORTS OF THINGS PUT INTO THESCREEN THAT ARE SOPHISTICATED
AND TECHNICAL.
>> THEY'VE GOT YOUNG TECH-SAVVYGUYS DOING IT.
>> STEPHEN: YES, I.S.I.S. ISCRANKING OUT MORE VIRAL HITS
THAN FUNNY OR DIE.
(LAUGHTER)MINUS THE FIRST PART.
(LAUGHTER)MEANWHILE, AL QUAIDA'S STILL
MAILING OUT VHS TAPES OF"GRANDPA KILL-'EM-ALL" DRONING
ON ABOUT "A FATWA ON PUDDINGSKIN!
"AND" DEATH TO WHOEVER CANCELEDMATLOCK!"
