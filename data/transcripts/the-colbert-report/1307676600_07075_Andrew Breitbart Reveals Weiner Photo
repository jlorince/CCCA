>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
HEY, THANK YOU.
NATION, I DON'T OFTEN SAY
THIS.
BUT I'M ASHAMED.
THANK YOU.
LAST NIGHT I SHOWED YOU AN
X-RATED PICTURE OF ANTHONY
WEINER'S PENIS, A PICTURE
THAT BLOGGER AND JOURNALISH
ANDREW BREITBART HAD IN HIS
POSSESSION BUT SAID HE WOULD
NOT RELEASE.
I'M TRYING TO THE DO THE
DESCENT THING AND NOT
RELEASE THE VOTE OWE-- PHOTO.
I'M DOING THERE TO TRY TO
SAVE HIS FAMILY BUT IT GOT
OUT ANYWAY THAT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN BASED ON THIS EARLIER
PICTURE, THIS PENIS CLEARLY
WANTED OUT.ñr
ANYWAY LAST NIGHT I SAID
THAT BREITBART RELEASED THE
PHOTO WHEN HE WAS VISITING
THE-- ANTHONY SHOW BUT IT
TURNS OUT BREITBART WAS JUST
ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE GOTCHA
MEDIA AS HE EXPLAINED ON THE
SUSTERAN WITH GRETA VON
RECORD.
>> I WENT ON THE SHOW OOUM'S
FRIENDS WITH ONE OF THE GUYS
ON THERE AND I JUST DECIDED
BEFORE I WENT TO THE AIRPORT,
WHY NOT STOP IN FOR SOME
HIGHJINKS.
>> Stephen: YES, HIGH
SINTION.
AS A JOURNALIST ANDREW
BREITBART ENGAGES IN ONLY
THE HIGHEST OF JINX.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, OPIE AND
ANTHONY'S JINXES ARE OF A
MUCH LOWER QUALITY.
>> DURING THE INTERVIEW,
THEY ASKED ME IF THEY COULD
SEE IT.
I SAID WELL MAKE SURE YOU
DON'T SHOW IT TO ANYONE AND
JIM NORTON SAID THERE AREN'T
ANY CAMERAS HERE.
AND SO I FELT VERY
COMFORTABLE THAT KNOCK, YOU
KNOW, BAD WOULD HAPPEN WITH
IT.
>> Stephen: HE WAS ASSURED
THAT THERE WERE NO CAMERAS.
AND LOOK AT THIS FOOTAGE OF
HIM WITH OPIE AND ANTHONY.
I DON'T SEE ANY CAMERAS
THERE.
AND THEY'RE SHOOTING HIM
PRETTY CLOSE.
IF THERE WAS A
CAMERA-- CAMERA THERE I
THINK WE'D SEE IT.
HE DID NOT KNOW THE PHOTO
WOULD GET OUT.
LOOK AT THAT FACE.
IT'S SO INNOCENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND HOW
HUMILIATING FOR ANDREW
BREITBART TO HAVE HIS
PRIVATE PHOTO OF ANTHONY
WEINER'S PRIVATE PARTS JUST
SLASH-- SPLASHED OUT THERE
ON THE INTERNET WITHOUT HIS
CONSENT.
>> AND I FOR ONE CANNOT
BELIEVE OPIE AND ANTHONY
BETRAYED HIS TRUST.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SACRED
TRADITION OF CONFIDENTIALITY
BETWEEN RESPECTED JOURNALIST
AND SHOCK JOCK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> TIME WAS EDWARD R. MURROW
COULD GO ON THE AIR WITH THE
MORNING ZOO CREW, FEBRUARIER
AND THE HELPCATS AND THEY
NEVER ONCE RELEASED MURROW'S
PHOTO OF FDR'S [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER)
HOW, HOW CAN I EVER TRUST A
DJ AGAIN.
IS THAT EVEN A REAL TOILET
THEY'RE FLUSHING?
IS THERE REALLY A HOT LEGS
CONTEST AT THE BEER BUCKET
TONIGHT.
AND IF SO, CAN I BE SURE
THERE ARE TEN SET WINGS AND
LADY'S DRINK FOR FREE.
FOLKS, HERE'S WHY I'M
ASHAMED.ñr
I MYSELF SHOWED THIS PHOTO
LAST NIGHT AND THEN AGAIN
JUST NOW SEVERAL TIMES ON MY
SHOW.
BUT I DID NOT IMTEND FOR
ANYONE TO SEE IT.
I WAS ASSURED BY MY NETWORK
THAT THESE ARE NOT CAMERAS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS I
THOUGHT I HAVE BEEN SHOUTING
INTO A TOASTER OVEN.
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW I
JUST WANTED TO HAVE SOME
HIGHJINKS.
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY.
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
