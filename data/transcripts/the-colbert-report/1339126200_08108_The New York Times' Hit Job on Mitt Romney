WAS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW NATION, IT'S NO SECRET THAT I'M NOT A FAN OF THE
"NEW YORK TIMES".
I CANNOT TRUST A PAPER THAT THINKS THAT THIS IS A-- NO,
IT'S NOT THIS IS A T.
AND WHAT ARE THOSE EXTRA PARTS?
HMMMM, WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT BEFORE?
AHA!!
NOW JUST CHECK OUT, FOLKS,
JUST CHECK OUT HOW DEEP IN THE TANK THESE GUYS ARE FOR BARACK OBAMA.
JUST TODAY THEY DID A HIT JOB ON MITT ROMNEY IN THE HOME SECTION.
LOOK AT THAT.
THE CANDIDATES NEXT DOOR,
FRONT PAGE, ABOVE THE FOLD,
MASSIVE ARTICLE, SLAMMING MITT ROMNEY'S $12 MILLION MANSION IN LA JOLLA,
CALIFORNIA.
FOR WHICH THE TIMES DEVOTED SEVERAL DAYS OF INTERVIEWS WITH ABOUT A DOZEN OF MITT'S
NEIGHBORS LEARNING ALL THE SALACIOUS DETAILS LIKE THE ELDERLY WOMAN NEXT DOOR
COMPLAINS THAT HER CAR IS CONSTANTLY BOXED INTO HER DRIVEWAY.
OH NO, MITT KEPT A CRANKY OLD LADY FROM DRIVING?
NOW WHO WILL PLOW INTO OUR FARMERS MARKETS?
(LAUGHTER) THE ARTICLE-- THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO SAY THAT DOWN THE STREET A WIDOW GROUSES THAT
HER CHILDREN'S FAVORITE DOG WALKING ROUTE HAS BEEN DISRUPTED.
A WIDOW?
OH, THANK YOU FOR THAT BY NO MEANS EMOTIONALLY MAN I LATIF DETAIL, "THE NEW YORK TIMES".
WHAT'S WRONG O COULDN'T YOU FIND A BLIND ORPHAN FOR HIM TO HAVE TRIPPED?
(LAUGHTER) BESIDES, WHAT IS SHE COMPLAINING ABOUT.
IF HER DOG NEEDS TO GO OUT,
MITT WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPEN TO-- HAPPY TO STRAP IT TO THE ROOF OF HIS CAR.
NOW FOLKS-- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
MOST OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE OVER THE MASSIVE RENOVATIONS THAT ROMNEY IS DOING TO HIS PROPERTY.
BUT GUESS WHAT, OLD GRAY LADY, NOBODY LIKES THE GUY GETTING RENOVATIONS DONEMENT
BUT AFTERWARDS IT LOOKS NICER AND PROPERTY VALUES GO UP.
SO GET OVER IT ALLEN.
MY DUMPSTER WILL BE OFF YOUR PATIO BY SEPTEMBER.
AND FOLKS, METT'S TO THE DOING MUCH HERE, HE'S JUST INSTALLING A CAR ELEVATOR.
IT'S A STANDARD RENOVATION LIKE ADDING A WINE CELLAR OR A TRAMPOLINE ROOM OR A WINE TRAMPOLINE.
IT'S NOT NEWS, NO.
WHAT'S NEWS IS WHAT THE TIMES THINKS IS NEWS, QUOTE,
A YOUNG MAN IN TOWN RECALLED THAT MR. ROMNEY CONFRONTED HIM AS HE SMOKED MARIJUANA
AND DRANK ON THE BEACH LAST SUMMER DEMANDING THAT HE STOP.
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE MITT ROMNEY SEEM LIKE OFFICER BUZZKILL.
OH, MEAN OLD MR. ROMNEY ON THE CORNER WON'T LET YOU SMOKE YOUR DOOBIES.
THAT GUY SHOULD BE GRACEFUL-- GRATEFUL, A MORMON REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, SEES YOU
SMOKING WEED AND DOESN'T NARK YOU OUT TO THE COPS IT IS?
WHO ARE GUARDING HIM?
I WOULD SAY THAT MAKES MITT ROMNEY HELLACHILL.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HASN'T HE BEEN ENDORSED BY HIGH TIMES.
(LAUGHTER) THE ONLY THING, THE ONLY THING THIS ARTICLE PROVES IS THAT EVERY SECTION OF THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" IS OUT TO GET MITT ROMNEY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT TODAY'S STYLE SECTION.
PUTTING TOGETHER THE PERFECT LOOK THAT SCREAMS JERK.
OR JUST LOOK AT DINING IN,
ROMNEY PUTS SILL ANT RO ON
