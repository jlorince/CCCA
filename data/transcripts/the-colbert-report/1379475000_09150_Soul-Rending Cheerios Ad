>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU KNOW THAT STEPHENCOLBERT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE
FAN OF ADVERTISING.
I ONLY WISH COMMERCIALS WEREN'TCONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED BY LONG
STRETCHES OF CHARACTERS ANDSTORIES.
WHO CARES WHO MURDER WHO?
I JUST WANT TO SEE TWO DIFFERENTPAPER TOWELS ABSORB THINGS.
( LAUGHTER )IS THAT ALL WE HAVE?
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY ON MY SHOW I PROMOTEPRODUCTS WHENEVER I CAN, FROM
WHEAT THINS TO DORITOS, TOLIBERIAN CONFLICT DIAMONDS.
SHE WON'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHOSHED A TEAR OVER THAT ENGAGEMENT
RING.
SO-- YEAH, OOOOH!
SO WHENEVER THERE'S A NEWINNOVATION IN ADVERTISING, I
TAKE NOTICE, FOLKS.
AND I WAS TRULY IMPRESSED BY THEGENIUS OF THIS RECENT AD FROM
THE GOOD FOLKS AT CHEERIOS.

BREAKFAST WITHNAN NANA.

( APPLAUSE )FOLKS, THE BEST IDEAS ALWAYS
SEEM--( LAUGHTER )
SO OBVIOUS IN HINDSIGHT, YETSOMEHOW NOBODY THOUGHT TO
LEVERAGE THE DEATH OF AGRANDPARENT TO HAWK SOME HOOCH
OF OATES.
I USED TO EAT SEAR WITHOUTCONSIDERING THE LONG LINES OF
LOVED ONE WHO SHUFFLED OFF THISMORTAL COIL LEAVING ME TO FACE
MY MARCH TO ABLIFFION ALONE,WEIGHED DOWN BY THE CHAINS OF
THE PAST.
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I ATE WHENI DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE
PANCAKES.
NOW I CAN'T WALK DOWN A CEREALAISLE WITHOUT ENTERING A HAUPTED
HOUSE OF LOSS AND REGRETS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER )

CLEAN UP IN AISLE HERE.
BUT, FOLKS, AS IMPRESSED AS I AMWITH THE WORK OF SOUL-RENDING
MARKETING YEENS, IT ALSO WASCAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE
APPARENTLY CHEERIOS ARE HAUNTEDBY THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.

PIMEAN, YOU HEARD THAT KID.
WHEN YOU EAT CHEERIOS THE DEPARTROAM YOUR BREAKFAST NOOK.
THEY'RE A PORTAL BETWEEN OURWORLD AND THE PURRATORY.
BE GONE FROM MY MILKY BOWL!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )I MEAN, FOLKS THE WARNING-- THE
WARNING SIGNS WERE ALWAYS THERE.
