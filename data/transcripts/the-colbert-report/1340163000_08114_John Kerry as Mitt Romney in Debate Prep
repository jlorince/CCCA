[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN'S NAME]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT BEGUN EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOIN US.
HEROS, ALL, HAVE A SEAT.
NATION, THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, AND IT WILL ALL COME
DOWN TO A CLASH OF IDEAS: DO WE WANT BIGGER GOVERNMENT, GAY MARRIAGE, AND CLASS WARFARE?
OR DO WE PREFER MITT ROMNEY'S MESSAGE: "I LOOK LIKE A PRESIDENT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.
EVERY FOUR YEARS, I PLAY A LITTLE DRINKING GAME WHERE I TAKE A SHOT OF BOURBON AS SOON
AS THE DEBATES START, AND DON'T STOP UNTIL ELECTION DAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I ALWAYS WIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BOTH CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY IN TRAINING.
IN FACT, OBAMA HAS PICKED HIS SPARRING PARTNER.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA TAPPING SENATOR KERRY TO HELP HIM WITH DEBATE REHEARSALS.
THE 2004 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE WILL PAY THE ROLE OF GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY IN MOCK DEBATES.
>> Stephen: OBAMA HAS CHOSEN KERRY TO PLAY MITT ROMNEY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS SHOCKING-- SOMEBODY CHOSE JOHN KERRY FOR SOMETHING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF KERRY IS UP TO PLAYING ROMNEY.
IN 2004 KERRY WAS A COMPROMISE CANDIDATE.
IN 2012, ROMNEY'S A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE.
KERRY COULDN'T CONNECT WITH VOTERS.
ROMNEY CAN'T RELATE TO THE ELECTORATE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
KERRY WAS IN A TOSS-UP RACE AGAINST AN UNPOPULAR INCUMBENT.
BUT ROMNEY IS IN A TIGHT CONTEST AGAINST AN UNPOPULAR SITTING PRESIDENT!
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PAGES OF A THESAURUS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
STILL, NOW THAT I KNOW JOHN KERRY WILL BE DEBATING PRESIDENT OBAMA, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
THROW MY FULL SUPPORT BEHIND JOHN KERRY.
THIS IS THE MAN AMERICA NEEDS TO DEFEAT BARACK OBAMA.
WHO BETTER TO FACE AMERICA'S CHALLENGES THAN A MAN WITH SO MUCH FACE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S MORE, JOHN KERRY IS A WAR HERO.
MEANWHILE, OBAMA AVOIDED THE VIETNAM DRAFT WITH A LETTER FROM HIS FAMILY DOCTOR DIAGNOSING HIM
AS MEDICALLY 8.
