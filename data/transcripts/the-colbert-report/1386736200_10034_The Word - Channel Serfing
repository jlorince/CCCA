[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: I HAVE ALWAYS SAID.
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID AMERICA ISTHE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: SOME NAYSAYERS THEY
SAY THE COUNTRY IS IN DECLINEBECAUSE IT'S HARDER TO GET INTO
WALMART THAN HARVARD.
REALLY?
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT SOUNDSLIKE [BEEP].
THEY CLAIM THE MIDDLE CLASS HAVEA DECLINING OF STANDARD OF
LIVING.
IT ADJUSTS TO INFLATION OF 199.
SO INCOME HASN'T CHANGED FROMTHE 80s.
NEITHER HAS A LOT OF THINGS.
LOOK AT ROB LOW.
YOU'RE OLDER THAN I AM!
WHY AREN'T YOU MELTING.
YOU'RE LIKE A FLOWER PRESERVEDIN AMBER.
NOW, NO SURPRISE --[LAUGHING]
>> Stephen: NO SURPRISE.
BITCHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASSHAS BECOME OBAMA'S LATEST PET
PROJECT.
WHICH HE DETAILED RECENTLY IN AMAJOR SPEECH HE CALLED "LET'S
TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT OBAMACARE."
JIM.
>> -- DECREASING MOBILITY POSE AFUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO THE
AMERICAN DREAM, OUR WAY OF LIFE,AND WHAT WE STAND FOR AROUND THE
GLOBE.
IT HAS JEOPARDIZED MIDDLE CLASSAMERICA, IF YOU WORK HARD YOU
HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD.
I BELIEVE THIS IS THE DEFININGCHALLENGE OF OUR TIME.
>> Stephen: NOT TRUE SIR.
I BELIEVE THE DEFINING CHALLENGEOF OUR TIME IS SELF HEATING
NACHOS.
WE'RE STILL WAITING, NASA.
WHEN THE PRECEDENT WAS DONEPANDERING TO THE POWERFUL
PAUPERS.
>> OUR OUR INCOME RATES NEARJAMAICA AND ARGENTINA BUT THAT
IT IS HARDER TODAY FOR A CHILDBORN HERE IN AMERICA TO IMPROVE
HER STATION IN LIFE THEN IT ISFOR CHILDREN IN MOST OF OUR
WEALTHY ALLIES.
>> Stephen: GENTLEMAN MAKE APOOR, REALLY.
I SPENT A WEEK IN THE SANDALSALL INCLUSIVE MONTEGO BAY.
NOBODY WAS POOR.
I CHECKED EVERY KA BAN.
>>Anthony: TAKE A CHILL PILL,SIR.
I KNOW THE MIDDLE CLASS ISBETTER OFF THAN EVER.
THAT TRUTH BRINGS US TONIGHT'SWORDS CHANNEL SERING.
NATION, FORGET WHAT THEPRESIDENT SAYS.
FORGET WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY.
FORGET WHAT YOUR BANK STATEMENTSAYS.
AMERICANS ARE DOING BETTER THANEVER.
THAT'S THE NEW VIRGINIA POSTRELREAD.
CONGRATULATIONS IT'S A GREATREAD AND GUARANTEES YOU WILL
NEVER GET A RAISE FOR THE RESTOF YOUR LIFE.
MS. POSTREL STARTS OFF WHAT SHESAYS MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS CALL
A LIFE EXPERIENCE.
WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME ON THEPLANE, PLAY POKER, WATCH "DUCK
DYNASTY" AND RUN HE WILLERY FROMTHE DVR QUE.
ROCKEFELLER COULDN'T STREAM"DUCK DYNASTY" ON THE iPAD.
BET HE COULD GET IS SEIGFELDFOLLIES ON HIS ZOOM.
THIS CHALLENGES THE INCREASINGCONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT'S
STAGNATED FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS.
IRE WELCOME MIDDLE CLASS.
I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN WATCHING MEIS A FORM OF CURRENCY.
ALSO FOR THE RECORD, A FORM OFSUBSTANCE APBS.
WHO NEEDS FOOD STAMPS.
BELLY UP TO THE ALL YOU CANSTEPHEN BUFFET.
BUT FOR SOME REASON, FOR SOMEREASON, FOLKS, ECONOMIC ANALYSTS
DON'T FACTOR IN THE VALUE OFQUALITY TV PROGRAMMING.
AS POSTREL POINTS OUT LITTLE OFTHIS CUSTOMIZED ENTERTAINMENT.
WAS POPULAR A DECADE AGO.
WHY DOESN'T WATCHING MORE TVCOUNT AS INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY.
FOLKS, ALL OF THIS ENTERTAINMENTISN'T A PLAYGROUND FOR THE RICH.
AS SHE SAYS NEW ENTERTAINMENTOPTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT TO POORER PEOPLE WITHAMPLE LEISURE TIME.
WHEN I SEE A MAN ON THE SIDEWALKI THINK LOOK AT THAT LUCKY FELLA
WITH AMPLE LEISURE TIME.
AMERICA, REMEMBER AMERICA ISEXTRA RICH RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE
ARE IN THE MIST OF A NEW GOLDENAGE OF TELEVISION.
SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE LATE ONYOUR MORTGAGE SEND A NOTE
REMAINING YOUR BANK THAT"BREAKING BAD" WON TEN EMMYS.
NOW, THE POINT IS BEINGDISTRACTED FROM YOUR POVERTY IS
THE NEW FORM OF WEALTH.
FOLKS, BY THAT STANDARD, BY THATSTANDARD AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS
ARE THE RICHEST PEOPLE INHISTORY.
JUST LOOK AT PORN.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE.
IT MAY NOT SHOW UP IN THEPRODUCTIVITY DATA BUT YOU'RE
PRODUCING SOMETHING.
SO, QUIT, QUIT COMPLAINING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU ARE RICH WITH TV.
REMEMBER MARINE ANTOINETTE MAYOF LIVED IN A PALACE.
SHE NEVER GOT TO WATCH THELEARNING CHANNEL.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
