>> Stephen: TONIGHT, AN OLD
GAME GETS AN UPDATE FOR TODAY'S
KIDS.
IT'S NOW HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN
SYRUP LAND.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN NEW GOVERNMENT HEALTH
GUIDELINES FOR WOMEN.
DUDES, JUST CONTINUE TREATING
WHATEVER YOU HAVE WITH TALCUM
POWDER.
THEN MY GUEST IS ROBERT WITTMAN,
AN ART CRIME INVESTIGATOR.
GOOD, I WANT TO TAKE OUT A
RESTRAINING ORDER ON THE MONA
LISA.
HER EYES KEEP FOLLOWING ME
AROUND THE ROOM.
GOD SAID I SHALL HAVE NO GODS
BEFORE ME, SO DON'T SPOIL YOUR
APPETITE WITH VISHNU POPPERS.
