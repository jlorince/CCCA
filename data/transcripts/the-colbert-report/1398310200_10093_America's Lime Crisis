>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOMEBACK, EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU KNOW, I AM NOTONE USUALLY TO GET WORKED UP
ABOUT DWINDLING RESOURCESBECAUSE I'M ADAPTABLE.
IF WE GET LOW ON SPOTTEDOWLS I'LL START MAKING MY
SANDWICHES WITH SNOWYEGRITS.
I MEAN ONCE THEY'RE BREADEDTHEY ALL TASTE LIKE PANDA.
BUT AMERICA IS NOW FACING ADEVASTATING SHORTAGE OF ONE
VITAL NATURAL RESOURCE.
>> THERE IS A MAJOR LIMESHORTAGE.
>> WE HAVE A LIME SHORTAGEON OUR HANDS.
>> LIME SHORTAGE.
>> LIME SHORTAGE.
>> LIME SHORTAGE.
>> Stephen: LIME SHORTAGE!
THAT MEANS NO MORE MARGARITAS,NO MOJITOS, THANKFULLY OUR
BUD LITE LIME IS SAFEBECAUSE IT IS FLAVORED WITH
GRADE PUG-INS.
EVEN WORSE-- DAMN WE SHOULDHAVE ONE.
EVEN WORSE, WE'LL HAVE TOFIND A NEW SOURCE OF TINY
CAT HELMETS.
APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY THEREIS A BACTERIA DISEASE
KILLING CITRUS TREES CALLEDHUONGLONBING WHICH TO BE
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IS NOT THENAME OF MY NEW ASIAN
CHARACTER.
NO HASHTAGS.
BUT-- I'M AFRAID THERE IS ANEVEN MORE SINISTER THREAT TO
OUR LIME INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.
>> IT ALL GOES BACK TO OURNEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH.
THE MICHOACAN IS MEXICO'STOP LIME PRODUCER.
AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET MOSTOF OUR LIMES FROM.
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS.
VIOLENCE BETWEEN DRUGCARTELS IN MICHOACAN HAS
WRECKED HAVOC ON THE LEMONAND LIME INDUSTRY, SOME
CARTELS STEALING A HALFMILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF
LIMES.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THISWORLD COMING TO WHEN MURDEROUS
MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS AREPEDDLING LIMES.
THAT'S LIKE WHAL WALTER WHITE STOPPING
COOKING METH AND COOKINGGLUTEN FREE BANANA BREAD.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: THE DRUG CARTELSPUT HUMONGOUS TAXES
ON FARMERS OR JUST KILL THEFARMERS AND TAKE OVER LIME
PRODUCTION THEMSELVES.
SO MOVE OVER BLOOD ORANGESTHERE IS A NEW CONFLICT
CITRUS.
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLYVICTIM OF THIS LIME CRIME.
>> THE ORANGE COUNTYREGISTER IS REPORTING A CASE
OF LIMES IS SELLING FOR$105.
THAT'S UP FROM JUST $20 AFEW WEEKS AGO.
>> LAST YEAR A LIME WAS LESSTHAN A QUARTER.
NOW WILL YOU PAY ABOUT 53CENTS.
>> Stephen: 53 CENTS FOR ALIME?
NOW YOU'RE TALKING TANGELOMONEY.
(LAUGHTER)SO IN RESPONSE TO THE
ECONOMIC HAVOC CAUSED BY THECARTEL SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING
THE UNTHINKABLE.
>> IN SOME CASES RESTAURANTSARE ALREADY CHOOSING TO MAKE
MIXED DRINKS AND EVENGUACAMOLE WITH LEMONS
INSTEAD OF LIME.
>> Stephen: LEMONS IN MYGUAC?
I'M SORRY, BUT I WOULDRATHER HAVE MY HEAD CHOPPED
OFF AND STUFFED IN A DUFFELBAG.
FOLKS, THIS CRISIS HITS HOMEFOR ME BECAUSE WE ARE COMING
UP ON GIN AND TONICSEASON.
I CANNOT EVEN THINK ABOUTHAVING A G AND T WITHOUT
LIME, LOOK AT THAT PUTTINGTHAT PICTURE UP MAKES MY
HANDSHAKE.
AND I, I WOULD LIKE TOBELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE OF
LIME WITHDRAWAL.
FOLKS, IN MY DESPERATION, IHAVE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO
RESORT TO BLACK MARKET CITRUS, JAY
THE INTERN COME ON OUT HERE.
