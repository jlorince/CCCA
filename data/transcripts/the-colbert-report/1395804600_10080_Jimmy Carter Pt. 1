WORLD.
PLEASE WELCOME FORMER PRESIDENTJIMMY CARTER!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORBEING HERE.
IT HAS BEEN A LONG-TIME GOAL OFMINE TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW SO
I CAN TAKE YOU TO TASK FOR YOURLIBERAL WAYS.
>> I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THAT.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER SEENTHE SHOW YOU'RE ON?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]DID YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A BONE TO
PICK WITH YOUR PRESIDENCY ANDYOUR LEGACY.
WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT.
YOU'VE GOT A BRAND-NEW BOOK.
>> I HAVE, YES.
>> Stephen: "A CALL TOREACTION, WOMEN, RELIGION,
VIOLENCE AND POWER."
FIRST OF ALL, JUST FROM THESUBTITLE, THIS ISN'T ONE OF
THOSE 50 SHADES, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT A DOZEN
BOOKS AT THIS POINT.
>> 28.
>> Stephen: 28 BOOKS.
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?
[ CHEERING ]I UNDERSTAND A CALL TO ACTION,
SIR.
WHAT DO WOMEN, RELIGION,VIOLENCE AND POWER HAVE TO DO
WITH EACH OTHER?
THEY SEEM LIKE UNRELATED TOPICS.
I UNDERSTAND THE VIOLENCE AND IASSUME THE POWER, BUT WHAT DOES
RELIGION HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
RELIGION IS THE GREATEST FORCEFOR THE GOOD -- AS LONG AS
YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN.
AND THE WORLD.
>> AND AS LONG AS YOU TAKE YOURRELIGION FROM JESUS CHRIST.
THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: I'M A CHRISTIAN,ARE YOU?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
YOU'RE NOT A BAPTIST YET.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT A BAPTIST.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT ACATHOLIC YET.
>> NO, NOT YET.
>> Stephen: THERE'S STILLTIME, SIR.
>> I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
I HAVE TWO PROVISIONS TO BECATHOLIC.
IF POPE FRANCIS STAYS ON INOFFICE AND WHEN A FEMALE
CATHOLIC PRIEST ASKS ME TO JOINHER CHURCH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ][ CHANTING ]
>> Stephen: THOSE ARE YOURDEMANDS.
JIMMY CARTER HAS DRAWN A LINE INTHE SAND.
[ LAUGHTER ]ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HAVE YOU TOLD THE POPE THIS?
>> I WROTE THE POPE A LETTERABOUT THIS BOOK AND ABOUT THE
PROBLEM WITH WOMEN'S ABUSE, ANDHE SENT ME A VERY WONDERFUL
LETTER BACK, AND HE SAID THAT HEAGREED WITH MANY THINGS THAT I
TOLD HIM ABOUT, WHICH HE ALREADYKNEW, I'M SURE, AND SAID, IN HIS
OPINION IN THE FUTURE YEARS,WOMEN NEEDED TO PLAY A MUCH
GREATER ROLE IN THE CATHOLICCHURCH THAN THEY WERE PLAYING
NOW OR HAVE PLAYED IN THE PAST.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOUTHINK THE NEGATIVE END OF
RELIGION IS WHEN IT RELATES TOWOMEN?
[ APPLAUSE ]THANK YOU.
I DID ASK THAT QUESTION WELL,THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT'S THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF
RELIGION?
>> WELL, IF YOU READ JUST THEWORDS AND ACTIONS OF JESUS
CHRIST, HE EXALTED WOMEN.
HE NEVER MADE ANY INSINUATIONTHAT WOMEN WERE INFERIOR IN ANY
WAY.
>> Stephen: BUT HE ONLY PICKED12 MALE APOSTLES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DON'T CRITICIZEJESUS, WATCH IT.
>> WHEN PAUL WROTE HIS LETTERSTO ASIA MINOR, HE WROTE TO THE
INDIVIDUAL CHURCHES ABOUT THEIRPROBLEMS AND SOME OF THE WORDS
OF PAUL AS OUR CHIEF RELIGIOUSTHEOLOGIANS FOR CHRISTIANS CAN
BE INTERPRETED EITHER WAY.
IF YOU ARE A MALE RELIGIOUSLEADER AND WANT TO STAY IN POWER
AND NOT WANT WOMEN CHALLENGERS,YOU CAN PICK SOME OF THE THINGS
PAUL SAID.
>> Stephen: MEN LOVE YOURWIVES, WIVES OBEY YOUR HUSBAND.
>> AND SAYS HUSBANDS AND WIVESSHOULD RESPECT TO THE OTHER AND
THEN GOES ON.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
BUT PAUL WROTE TO THEGALATIANS SAYING THERE'S NO
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MAN ANDWOMAN, SLAVE AND MASTER, GENTILE
OR JEW, EVERYONE'S EQUAL IN THEEYES OF GOD.
SO THERE ARE 36,000 OR SO VERSESIN THE BIBLE AND YOU CAN CHOOSE
ONE OR THE OTHER ONES IF YOUWANT TO --
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT'SGREAT ABOUT AMERICA.
OUR FREEDOM OF RELIGION ALLOWSME TO INTERPRET THE BIBLE
EXACTLY AS MY WORLD VIEWALREADY.
>> YEAH, I NOTICED THAT ON YOURSHOW.
>> Stephen: YEP.
[ APPLAUSE ]IF I READ THIS BOOK, MY PROBLEM
WITH LIBERALS IS THEY'RE ALWAYSTRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT THINGS.
AS A WHITE, CHRISTIAN, MALE,UPPER-CLASS GUY, AM I GOING TO
FEEL GUILTY IF I READ THIS BOOK?
BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE SO MUCHGUILT.
I ALREADY FEEL -- YOU KNOW, IFEEL GUILTY ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE,
ABOUT WOMEN NOW.
A BLACK WOMAN WALKS IN THE ROOM,I'VE GOT TO LEAVE.
TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.
WILL THIS MAKE ME FEEL BAD?
>> NOT UNLESS YOU'RE IN FAVOR OFABUSING GIRLS ON THE CAMPUS OR
IN THE MILITARY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OR UNLESS YOU'RE IN FAVOR OFSLAVERY.
>> Stephen: NO.
SLAVERY IS A WORSE PROBLEMNOW THAN IN THE 19th CENTURY.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND --IT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: WE HADINSTITUTIONALIZED SLAVERY THEN.
>> I KNOW.
80% OF SLAVES SOLD ACROSS THEBORDERS ARE LITTLE GIRLS SOLD
INTO SEXUAL SLAVERY AND THISCOMES FROM THE U.S. STATE
DEPARTMENT IN WHICH I'M SURE YOUHAVE CONFIDENCE WHEN A
REPUBLICAN IS THERE.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: WELL, WE HAVE TO
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.
WHEN WE COME BACK, LET'S TALKABOUT THE TIME THERE WAS A
DEMOCRAT THERE NAMED SERIOUSLYJAMES EARL CARTER.
WILL YOU STICK AROUND?
>> I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
