THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WITHOUT A DOUBT.
FOLKS, YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA
GAVE A MAJOR ABOUT THE ECONOMY
AT AN AMAZON DISTRIBUTION
CENTER.
I THINK HE CHOSE AMAZON BECAUSE
THEY'RE GOING TO START EQUIPPING
CONGRESSMEN WITH A "BUY NOW"
BUTTON.
I WASN'T REALLY PAYING THAT MUCH
ATTENTION TO THE SPEECH BECAUSE
TODAY'S PRESIDENT IS YESTERDAY'S
NEWS.
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE WATCHING
A RERUN OF THIS SHOW.
NOW, LIKE EVERY OTHER
JOURNALIST, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
WILL HAPPEN IN 2016.
WELL, YESTERDAY WE GOT OUR FIRST
CLUE WHEN HILLARY CLINTON
STOPPED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> SHE SPENT ABOUT TWO HOURS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DID THEY
TALK ABOUT?
>> COULD IT HAVE SOME INKLING OF
WHAT COULD TAKE PLACE IN 2016?
>> JUST LUNCH OR IS IT CAMPAIGN
2016 JUST GETTING STARTED?
WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY
RODHAM CLINTON HAVING A PRIVATE
LUNCH TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: THE WHITE HOUSE!
AT THE (SING SONG N) WHITE
HOUSE.
WHAT COULD IT MEAN?
PING, PING.
WE DON'T KNOW.
BUT A TOTAL ABSENCE OF FACTS HAS
NEVER STOPPED CABLE NEWS BEFORE.
REMEMBER, WE'RE THE ONES WHO
BROKE THE STORY THAT THE ROYAL
BABY WAS EITHER A BOY OR A GIRL.
AND WE WERE RIGHT.
SO WE WERE ALL READY WITH OUR
CRACK ANALYSIS IN THAT FOR THE
MOST PART WE PULLED IT OUT OF
OUR CRACKS.
>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO
PUT ANYTHING ON HIS SCHEDULE.
PUTTING THAT WE'RE HAVING LUNCH
WITH HILLARY CLINTON ON THE
SCHEDULE CLEARLY SAYS SOMETHING.
>> Stephen: YEAH, SOMETHING.
DON'T KNOW WHAT THOUGH.
AND NEITHER DOES TOURE.
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIS
LAST NAME IS.
STILL, A GREAT STORY.
BUT IS THERE ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS LUNCH?
>> DID IT AL FRESCO, THAT MEANS
OUTDOORS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OUTDOORS.
OUTDOORS.
GOT THAT.
AND, OKAY AND I'M BEING TOLD
DOORS MEANS BIG HOUSE WITH NO
WALLS AND SKY CEILING.
WE'RE GETTING SOME PLACE.
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW?
>> THE PRESIDENT IN SHIRT
SLEEVES.
>> THEY ALSO LET US KNOW THAT
THEY HAD GRILLED CHICKEN AND
PASTA.
>> YOU COULD SEE IN THE PICTURE
SOME SALAD.
THERE WERE NO DRINKS IN THE
PICTURE SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
WAS SERVED AS A BEVERAGE WITH
THEIR LUNCH.
>> IS IT A LUNCH JUST A LUNCH?
WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WHAT'S GOING
ON?
I MEAN, IS A LUNCH JUST A LUNCH?
IF YOU EAT BREAKFAST AT 11:30,
DOES THAT MAKE IT BRUNCH?
WILL THE GRA TEUT BE ADDED
AUTOMATICALLY ON A PARTY OF
EIGHT OR MORE?
WHILE WE'RE ADD IT, COULD IT GET
THE COBB SALAD WITHOUT BOILED
EGG, BLUE CHEESE OR BACON?
OH, AND INSTEAD OF KREUT ONS,
COULD I GET SOME [BLEEP] NEWS?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OR IS THAT JUST OFF THE MENU?
IS THAT NOT AVAILABLE?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED NEWS FROM THE CABLE
CROWD BECAUSE I CAN ANALYZE THE
ENTIRE 2016 CAMPAIGN STRATEGY
THROUGH THIS LUNCH.
FIRST OF ALL, HILLARY'S
CAMPAIGN, IT IS ON TO THE ON.
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY ATE OUTDOORS
TO WOO THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS.
HAD THE JAMBALAYA TO COURT GULF
COAST DEMOCRATS.
PRESIDENT'S ROLED-UP SLEEVES
SAY, "I SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO
BARE ARMS."
BUT THE LACK OF BEVERAGES SAYS
THAT UNDER HILLARY, THERE WILL
BE NO WATER BOARDING, TAP OR
SPARKLING.
AND THE GRILLED CHICKE
