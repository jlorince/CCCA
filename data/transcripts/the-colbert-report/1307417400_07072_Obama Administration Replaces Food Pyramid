ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
NATION, WE ALL KNOW THE
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO RAM
THEIR HEALTH FOOD AGENDA
DOWN OUR THROATS.
WHICH ISN'T EASY TO DO SINCE
MOST OF THOSE THROATS ARE
BLOCKED BY TOASTER STRUDELS.
WELL, FOLKS, CHECK OUT THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S
LATEST ATTACK ON OUR
BELLIES.
>> THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS
MAKING SOME NEW MOVES TO GET
US TO EAT A LITTLE BETTER.
THIS IS THE OLD FOOD PYRAMID,
THERE IT IS.
IT'S OUT, OUT.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.
>> Stephen: NO FOOD PYRAMID?
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE
EGYPTIAN MORTGAGE AREA FACE
NUTRITIONAL DIAGRAM, EVEN
BETTER THAN THE FOOD SPHINX.
AND WHAT ARE THEY PROPOSING
TO REPLACE THE FOOD TOMB?
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
PLANS TO REPLACE THE MUCH
MALIGNED FOOD PYRAMID WITH
JUST A PLATE.
>> Stephen: A PLATE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FOR FOOD?
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?
AMERICANS DON'T USE PLATES
ANY MORE.
OUR FOOD COMES FROM CASES,
BAGS, CANS, TUBES AND
ENVELOPES MADE OF THEMSELVES.
AND FOLKSES, I GOT TO SAY,
IF YOU ARE'S GOING TO GO
WITH A CIRCULAR FOOD DIAGRAM
WITH WEDGES WHY NOT JUST USE
A PIE CHART.
YOU SEE?
YOU GOT YOUR PROTEINS, YOU
GOT YOUR GRAINS, AND YOU GOT
YOUR FRUIT.
AND I RIGHT NOW AM GOING TO
HAVE MY SERVING OF VEGGIES.
HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM,
HMMMM.
BE CAREFUL.
WOOD IS TECHNICALLY A VEGGIE
AND DON'T FORGET TO GET YOUR
DAIRY.
JUST EAT ONE OF THESE A DAY
FOR A BALANCED DIET AND THEN
YOU CAN HAVE DESSERT.
