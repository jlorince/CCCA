(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I SHARED A FEW
THINGS.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, THIS IS A VERY BIG
WEEK FOR REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
TONIGHT THERE IS THE DEBATE
IN IOWA THAT WILL FEATURE
ALL THE MAJOR PLAYERS
ANDTISM PAWLENTY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THEN SATURDAY,
OF COURSE, IS THE STRAW POLL
IN AMES, A CRUCIAL TEST TO
SEE IF CANDIDATES CAN GET
MIDWESTERNERS TO PUT DOWN A
FOOD PLATE LONG ENOUGH TO
MARK A BALLOT BUT THE BIG
NEWS TODAY CAME FROM THE
IOWA STATE FAIR IN DES
MOINES WHERE IN AN ATTEMPT
TO PEEL TO MORE VOTERS RON
PAUL HAD HIMSELF BATTER
DIPPED AND DEEP FAT FRIED.
THAT WAS GOOD.
MORE CHIPOTLE SAUCE.
MEANWHILE, MITT ROMNEY WAS
AT THE STATE FAIR IN HIS
EVERY MAN DUNGAREES WHEN HE
WAS AMBUSHED BY LIBERAL
ACTIVISTS WITH A GOTCHA
QUESTION ABOUT SOCIAL
SECURITY.
AND WITH HIS ANSWER, ROMNEY
PROVED HE DIDN'T JUST DRESS
LIKE THE AVERAGE JOE, HE
UNDERSTANDS THE AVERAGE JOE.
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE PROMISES WE MAKE IN
SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID
AND MEDICARE ARE PROMISES WE
CAN KEEP.
AND THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS
OF DOING THAT.
ONE IS WE COULD RAISE TAXES
ON PEOPLE.
>> CORPORATIONS.
>> CORPORATIONS.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
MY FRIEND.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> AW.
>> Stephen: CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.
THEY'RE LIKE MEMBERS OF YOUR
FAMILY.
YOUR BROTHER, FAX MACHINE.
YOUR UNCLE ZEN, YOUR
AUNTANNIE, YOUR MAMA CELESTE,
YOUR GO DADDY.
FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
THIS GOOD FIGHT FOR YEARS.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE LEGALLY
PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE
TOO.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU LET
YOUR DAUGHTER DATE A
CORPORATION, SIR?
>> NO, I WOULD NOT.
>> Stephen: WOW.
IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT
KIND OF BIGOT REE, IT IS
TIME TO REMAKE GUESS WHO'S
COMING TO DINNER.
THIS TIME WITH AN OIL RIG.
(LAUGHTER)Ã‘i
AND YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW IT IS
GOING TO DRIVE EXPERIENCE
EAR TRACY CRAZY TO THINK
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER GETTING
DRILLED.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW WITH ROMNEY'S HISTORIC
STATEMENT OF CORPORATE
PERSONHOOD HE HAS BECOME
THIS GENERATIONS CIVIL
RIGHTS CHAMPION.
A DR. MARTIN LUTHER INC., IF
YOU WILL.
SO FOLKS, I WANT TO SALUTE
THIS BRAVE MAN FOR HIS
COURAGEOUS NEW CAMPAIGN
SLOGAN.
I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT IS
ONE THAT VOTERS WILL
REMEMBER COME ELECTION TIME.
OF COURSE, WITH ALL OF THIS
HAPPENING, FOLKS, --
>> YOU CAN APPLAUD ME.
YOU CAN APPLAUD ME.
