(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
PRESIDENT OF AMERICANS FOR TAX
REFORM.
HE IS NOT GOING TO LIKE MY 45%
GUEST TAX.
PLEASE WELCOME GROVER NORQUIST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, STEVEN.
>> Stephen: THREE YEARS,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
>> EXACTLY ABOUT THREE YEARS,
YEAH.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
NOW, SIR, FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE
WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT AMERICANS
FOR TAX REFORM IS, EXPLAIN WHAT
THE PURPOSE OF YOUR ORGANIZATION
IS.
>> FIRST OF ALL, WE ASK ALL
CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE TO SIGN A
PLEDGE NOT TO RAISE TAXES THEN
WE LET VOTERS KNOW WHO'S WILLING
TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT AND WHO
DOES OR DOESN'T LIVE BY IT.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THAT?
>> 20 YEARS.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> YUP.
>> Stephen: AND YOU'VE GOT IT ON
RECORD.
IS THIS THE PLEDGE RIGHT HERE?
>> THAT'S THE PLEDGE.
>> Stephen: SO THEY TAKE THIS
PLEDGE AND YOU'VE GOT A RECORD
OF THEM HAVING TAKEN THE PLEDGE
AND IF THEY BACK OUT ON THIS
PLEDGE?
>> WELL....
>> Stephen: IT'S HAMMER TIME!
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY'RE
ACTUAL VOTERS.
THE PLEDGE IS NOT TO AMERICANS
FOR TAX REFORM, IT'S THE THE
VOTERS OF THEIR STATE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND PEOPLE HOLD THEM
RESPONSIBLE.
GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, BUSH
41 HAD A FAIRLY REASONABLELY
SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENCY.
HE ENDED THE COLD WAR WITHOUT A
LOT OF BLOOD ON THE FLOOR.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> GOT IRAQ OUT OF KUWAIT
WITHOUT OCCUPYING THE PLACE FOR
THE NEXT 12 YEARS AND HE HAD ONE
SMALL PROBLEM AND THIS IS THAT
HE RAISED TAXES WHEN HE PROMISED
HE WOULDN'T.
AND HE LOST HIS JOB.
>> Stephen: DID HE SIGN THIS?
>> HE DID, INDEED, YEAH.
>> Stephen: DID YOU WAVE THIS
BLOODY SHIRT DURING THAT
CAMPAIGN TO BRING THAT GUY DOWN?
>> I DIDN'T NEED TO.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DID.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SHOW THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE SHIRT?
(LAUGHTER)
DID YOU DISTRIBUTE THIS TO
EVERYONE IN AMERICA?
HOW DO THEY GET THIS?
>> THE MEDIA LETS PEOPLE KNOW
AND VOTERS KNOW.
SO WE SHARE THE PLEDGE,
OBVIOUSLY.
SINCE YOU TOOK THE PLEDGE THREE
YEARS AGO WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING
TO POSSIBLY RUN FOR
PRESIDENT....
>> Stephen: LOOKING TO RUN A
RUN?
I RAN FOR PRESIDENT, SIR.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IT WAS ONLY...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND IT'S ONLY THAT I WAS NOT
ALLOWED TO THAT OBAMA'S NOT IN
OFFICE TODAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SINCE THEN WE NOW HAVE 236
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE WHO'VE
MADE THE COMMITMENT NOT TO RAISE
TAXES.
41 SENATORS AND FOR THAT
REASON... 13 GOVERNORS AS WELL
AS 1,200 STATE LEGISLATORS.
>> Stephen: CAN PEOPLE SAY "I
WON'T RAISE TAXES" WITHOUT
SIGNING THIS PLEDGE?
BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE "HEY, I'M NOT
GOING TO RAISE TAXES" AND IS
THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
>> WELL, A LOT OF POLITICIANS
FOR THE LAST 200 YEARS HAVE SAID
"I WON'T RAISE TAXES" OR "I'D
PREFER NOT TO RAISE TAXES, IT
WOULD BE A LAST RESORT."
>> Stephen: I LOVE MY WIFE...
>> ...HOWEVER.
(LAUGHTER)
PEOPLE TEND NOT TO TRUST THAT
WHICH IS WHY NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE
IN THE WRITING BUT WE HAVE TWO
WITNESSES, IT'S DATED AND WE
KEEP HIT IN THE SAFE.
>> Stephen: ANYBODY THIS YEAR
YOU WANT TO GET THAT YOU HAVEN'T
GOTTEN YET?
>> ON THE PLEDGE, WE HAVE ALL
THE REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR THE
PLEDGE RIGHT NOW EITHER SIGNED
OR COMMITTED TO EXCEPT HUNTSMAN
IS THE ONE WHO HASN'T YET.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
REALLY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> HE JUST STARTED.
CUT HIM SOME SLACK.
>> Stephen: WOULDN'T YOU
RECOMMEND PEOPLE DO THIS FIRST?
>> WE DO URGE PEOPLE SIGN EARLY,
NOT NECESSARILY OFTEN, BUT EARLY
YES.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL GET THERE.
>> Stephen: LET'S DO THE PLEDGE
AGAIN BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT.
I PLEDGE TO THE TAXPAYERS OF THE
UNITED STATES OF NAESHG I WILL
OPPOSE AND VETO ANY AND ALL
EFFORTS TO INCREASE TAXES.
>> FAIRLY SIMPLE.
>> Stephen: I'VE GOT TO SAY,
GROVER, I DON'T SEE "UNDER GOD"
ANYWHERE IN THIS PLEDGE.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW CAN BIT A PROPER PLEDGE IF
IT DOESN'T SAY "UNDER GOD"?
>> WELL, YOU COULD ADD THAT IF
YOU'D LIKE BUT OTHERWISE IT'S
NOT UP TO...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW, WOULD YOU SIGN
MY PLEDGE THAT YOU WILL ADD
"UNDER GOD" TO YOUR PLEDGE?
>> WE'LL TAKE IT UNDER
ADVISEMENT.
WE HAVEN'T CHANGED IN THE 24
YEARS.
>> Stephen: SIR, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH "UNDER GOD"?
>> NOTHING'S WRONG....
>> Stephen: BY GOD, OF COURSE,
WE MEAN JESUS.
(LAUGHTER)
PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS ARE
ENCOURAGED TO SIGN THE PLEDGE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT NOT
TO RAISE TAXES IS ONLY IF PEOPLE
TAKE PLEDGE NOT TO RAISE TAXES
DO YOU EVEN GET A CONVERSATION
ABOUT REIGNING IN SPENDING AND
OVERSPEDING IS THE PROBLEM THAT
WE HAVE BOTH IN D.C. AND IN ALL
50 STATE CAPITALS.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOU SUPPORT THE
REPUBLICANS WALKING OUT ON THE
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE DEMOCRATS
RECENTLY, RIGHT?
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE DEBT
CEILING COMING UP, WE CAN'T MAKE
OUR ENDS MEET COME AUGUST 3,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BALLPARK
IT?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHEN WE
DEFAULT.
ARE YOU IN FAVOR-- AS I AM-- OF
DEFAULTING ON OUR DEBTS,
CHANGING OUR NAMES AND MOVING TO
CANADA?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S NOT A STRATEGY I'D
THOUGHT OF.
I WAS SORT OF GOING FOR THE
ORIGINAL ONE WHICH IS ONLY AN
INCREASE OF THE DEBT OF $2
TRILLION, WHICH IS WHAT BARACK
OBAMA WANTS IF WE GET $2
TRILLION IN SPENDING REDUCTION
IN A SERIOUS AND REAL FORM.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I'M GOING TO
ASK YOU A TRICK QUESTION.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: I HOPE YOU HAVE THE
RIGHT ANSWER.
IS THERE ANY TIME AND ANY
CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH RAISING
TAXES WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING
TO DO?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: GOOD ANSWER.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
NOW LET'S AMP IT UP A LITTLE
BIT.
OKAY?
TERRORISTS HAVE KIDNAPPED ALL OF
OUR GRANDMOTHERS.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY'VE GOT THEM IN A
SUBTERRANEAN BORROW WHICH YOU
KNOW THEY HAVE AND ALL OF OUR
GRANDMOTHERS HAVE BEEN SLATHERED
WITH HONEY AND THEY'RE GOING TO
RELEASE FIRE ANTS INTO THIS
BOROUGH THAT WILL BITE OUR
GRANDMOTHERS TO DEATH.
THEIR ONLY DEMANDD IS THAT WE
INCREASE THE MARGINAL TAX RATE
ON THE TOP 2% OF AMERICANS AND
WE WILL RELEASE THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
DO WE INCREASE THE TAX RATE OR
DO WE LET OUR GRANDMOTHERS DIE
BY ANT BITE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK WE CONSOLE OURSELVES
WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE
PICTURES.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: NO, THAT'S THE RIGHT
ANSWER.
THE MAN SIGNED A PLEDGE.
GRANDMOTHERS BE DAMNED!
HE SIGNED A PLEDGE.
GROVER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(APPLAUSE)
THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICANS FOR
TAX REFO
