FAVORITE CHARACTER.
I'M GOING TO GO AS A GOTCHA QUESTION.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, LAST MONTH WHEN THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION APPROVED COLBERT SUPERPAC
THEY MADE IT LEGAL FOR ME TO ACCEPT UNLIMITED DONATIONS AND TALK ABOUT IT AS MUCH AS
I WANT ON THIS TELEVISION SHOW.
NOW SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE ALREADY GONE TO COLBERT SUPERPAC.COM AND DONATED.
BRINGING US EVER CLOSER TO OUR GOAL OF INFINITE DOLLARS.
UNFORTUNATELY-- ,
UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, WE ARE STILL INFINITE AWAY.
SO TO SEDUCE THE PRUDENT STARTING NOW I AM PUTTING THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
GIVEN ME MONEY ON THIS CRAWL.
THERE THEY ARE.
THESE ARE THE ACTUAL NAMES OF THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN ME MONEY IN THE
ORDER THEY HAVE GIVEN IT TO ME.
REMEMBER, ACCORDING TO THE FEC THIS IS 100% LEGAL AND AT LEAST 10% ETHICAL.
(LAUGHTER) I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ELECTION COMMISSIONERS BY NAME AND I
WILL AS SOON AS THEY DONATE.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE--  (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLK, YEAH, GOOD PEOPLE.
CORY, MARTIN, JONATHAN WU,
GOOD PEOPLE.
OF COURSE SOME WILL SAY THAT MY NEW CASH CRAWL JUST PROVES THAT THIS MUCH MONEY
IN POLITICS IS A PROBLEM.
BUT IS IT REALLY?
AND IF SO, HOW MUCH MONEY WILL IT TAKE TO MAKE THE PROBLEM GO AWAY.
TO FIND OUT I SPOKE TO PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE.
SHEILA KRUMHOLZ THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS A GROUP THAT
ADVOCATES TRANSPARENTSY IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE, FINE WITH ME, I'M USING MY MONEY TO
DEVELOP AN INVISIBILITY CLOAK.
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, SEAN PARNELL FROM THE CENTER OF COMPETITIVE POLITICS.
THEY SUPPORT UNLIMITED AND UNTRACKABLE MONEY IN POLITICS AND I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME.
