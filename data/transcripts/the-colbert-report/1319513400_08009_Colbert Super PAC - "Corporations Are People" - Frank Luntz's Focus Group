>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK
I SAT DOWN WITH REPUBLICAN
STRATEGIST FRANK LUNTZ TO
CRAFT MY SUPERPACK MESSAGE
THAT CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE.
NOW THE DRAMATIC SECOND PART
OF THE FIRST PART YOU JUST
WATCHED.
JIM?
>> ON BEHALF OF THE COLBERT
SUPERPAC CONSERVATIVE
MESSAGE GURU FRANK LUNTZ
CONVENED THIS ACTUAL FOCUS
GROUP WHILE HE WATCHED
BEHIND A TWO WAY MIRROR.
>> WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING
PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA
TODAY.
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU
THINK AND HOW YOU FEEL.
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE THE
STATEMENT RAISE YOUR HANDS.
>> THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE
EASY.
>> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
AREN'T CORPORATIONS PEOPLE.
>> CORPORATIONS PAY OFF
POLITICIANS EVERY YEAR.
>> WITH DONATIONS.
>> THEY'RE GETTING AWAY WITH
MURDER.
>> CORPORATIONS AREN'T
PEOPLE.
>> FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.
>> THE PERFECT VISUAL FOR MY
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE AD.
SO I HAD FRANK DIAL TEST
EVERYTHING FROM BABIES TO
TRUCK A SAURUS.
TURNS OUT AMERICA LOVES THE
STATUE OF LIBERTY, THE GRAND
CANYON, BALLISTIC MISSILES,
PUPPIES IN BOXES AND A
SHIRTLESS MATTHEW
McCONNEGHEY.
BUT TO CREATE THE PERFECT AD,
WE WOULD NEED A PHRASE THAT
TESTED BETTER THAN
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
COMMUNICATE THE CORPORATIONS
ARE PEOPLE.
I COULD SEE THE LIFECYCLE OF
A COMPANY, STARTING SMALL
AND GOING BIG.
>> I WOULD TRY TO SHOW THEM
AS PEOPLE LITERALLY BUT
METAPHORICALLY AND WHAT THEY
DO AND HOW THEY DO SIMILAR
THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO.
>> THEY HAVE TO HUMANIZED
COMPANY.
>> I DIDN'T CATCH EVERYTHING
THEY SAID.
>> IS THERE ANY MORE CHEESE.
>> FORTUNATELY, FRANK LUNTZ
I FEWED ALL THE DATA INTO
ONE MEMO AND THEN SAT DOWN
WITH ME TO EXPLAIN THE
STRATEGY IN THE COLBERT
SUPERPAC HEADQUARTERS.
>> ALL RIGHT, FRANK, HOW I
CAN BEST SAY CORPORATIONS
ARE PEOPLE.
>> WE GOT THREE SLOGANS FOR
YOU TO CONSIDER.
>> OKAY.
>> NUMBER ONE IS
CORPORATIONS ARE HUMAN.
>> THAT IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE
I BELIEVE THAT CORPORATIONS
SHOULD BE AFFORDED ALL THE
RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS.
>> OKAY, FREE SPEECH, RIGHT
TO BEAR ARMS, RIGHT TO GET
MARRIED.
>> RIGHT TO GET MARRIED.
>> SURE, NOT GAY MARRIED,
HETEROSEXUAL.
>> SO IS APPLE A MAN OR
WOMAN.
>> WOMAN, MICROSOFT IS A
MAN.
I WOULDN'T WANT, YOU KNOW,
JOHNSON & JOHNSON GETTING
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, PROCTER
& GAMBLE, THAT SEEMS ON THE
UP AND UP.
>> PROCTER IS THE GUY, BY
THE WAY.
>> CAN WE DOT NEXT ONE.
>> OKAY.
>> THE SECOND ONE IS
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE BUT
THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY BE
CHINESE PEOPLE OR AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
>> I LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT
PLAYS ON MY INNATE PATRIOTIC
SENSE AND MY FEAR OF CHINESE
PEOPLE.
SO.
>> NOW YOU TAKE THE FLAG
OUT.
>> OKAY.
>> HOLD IT UP.
>> GOT IT.
>> DO I WANT IT TO BE
AMERICAN PEOPLE OR A CHINESE
PEOPLE.
HAVE YOU EVER MET MY
CHARACTER CHING CHONG DING
DONG.
>> OH, IT'S TOO HOT.
I GOT COOL THAT OFF.
>> FRANK, I'M NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING MY
CHARACTER JUST SAID.
>> YES, ARE YOU.
>> NO, MY CHARACTER IS CHING
CHONG DING DONG.
>> MY LIFE DEPENDS ON YOU
NOT PUTTING THAT FLAG INTO
THAT-- YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
>> IT'S NOT COFFEE, IT'S TEA
WING NO DING DONG.
>> NO, CHING CHONG DING ON.
OKAY W GO AHEAD.
WE'VE GOT ONE MORE FOR YOU
WHICH ARE PEOPLE ARE
CONSIDERATIONS.
>> PEOPLE ARE CORPORATIONS.
>> YES.
>> YOU JUST REVERSED THE
ORDER OF THE WORDS.
>> YES.
BECAUSE THE ORDER MATTERS.
>> DID YOU JUST POOP THAT
OUT BE THE CAN RIDE OVER
HERE.
>> NO, ORDER LANGUAGE ORDER
MATTERS A EQUALS B, B EQUALS
A.
>> A PLUS B EQUALS C.
B PLUS A DOES NOT
NECESSARILY EQUAL C.
C PLUS A MAY EQUAL B BUT C
MINUS B DOES NOT NECESSARILY
EQUAL A.
(LAUGHTER)
WITHIN ARE YOU JUST BLOWING
MY MIND.
(LAUGHTER)
SO SOMETIMES WORD ORDER
HELPS.
>> ORDER ORDER MAKES ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: CAN WE TAKE IT
FURTHER CAN.
WE SAY CORPORATIONS PEOPLE
ARE.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WE COULD GET
YODDA TO DO IT.
IS THIS ALL THAT YOU GAVE
FROM THE FOCUS GROUP.
>> I'M TRYING TO ADD WHAT
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME.
YOU GAVE ME A FOUNDATION I
CAN BUILD ON.
I'M TRYING TO BUILD ON IT.
>> FROM HERE WE CAN DEVELOP
THE AD.
WHICH KNOW WHICH WORDS TO
TAKE OUT.
WE KNOW WHICH VISUALS WORK.
I THINK WE CAN CREATE A
KILLER 30 SECOND AD.
YOU UP FOR IT.
>> Stephen: I'M UP FOR IT,
FRANK.
FOLKS IN THE COMING WEEKS WE
WILL BE WORKING WITH FRANK
LUNTZ TO CREATE THE PERFECT
AD TO CHANGE THE HEARTS AND
MINDS OF THOSE 99 PERCENTERS.
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY.
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE HALF THE
