PRESIDENTIAL MOMENT, THEONLY WAY, ONLY WAY HILLARY
CLINTON COULD SEEM MORE LIKEA LEADER IS IF SHE CHOKED ON
A PRETZEL WHILE FALLING OFFA SEGWAY.

EITHER THIS INCIDENT WAS ONETINY MACHINATION IN THE VAST
MASTER PLAN METICULOUSLYORCHESTRATED BY THE CLINTONS
OR SOME CRAZY LADYTHREW A SHOE AT HER.
ASK YOURSELF THIS.
WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWOPOSSIBILITIES LETS ME TALK
ABOUT IT FOR SIX MINUTES?

GET RE-ELECTED IN 2012,STEERING A PATH FOR A SHOE
TO BE THROWN AT HER THE VERYSAME WEEK WE LEARN CHELSEA
IS PREGNANT.
