(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, LIKE YOU I AM OVERWHELMED BY THE ENORMITY OF THE HORROR THAT TOOK PLACE EARLY FRIDAY
MORNING IN COLORADO.
THE COMMUNITY OF AURORA IS IN OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AS THEY GRIEVE THIS SENSELESS CRILE.
THE BORN OF COLORADO HAS SUGGESTED IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF THIS TRAGEDY YOU GO TO Www.givingfirst.org.
NOW, THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT I'VE BROADCAST SINCE THIS HAPPENED FOUR DAYS AND AND FACED
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS THERE IS NOTHING REALLY TO BE SAID-- OTHER THAN I AM SORRY THAT OTHER
BROADCASTERS GOT TO SAY ALL THAT NOTHING BEFORE I HAD A SHOT.
(LAUGHTER) HOW TO MAKE THIS TRAGEDY PARTISAN?
JIM?
>> I WANT TO GO TO BRIAN ROSS.
BRIAN, YOU'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE BACKGROUND OF JIM HOLMES,
YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT.
>> THERE IS A JIM HOLMES OF AURORA, COLORADO, PAGE, ON THE COLORADO TEA PARTY SIDE AS WELL
TALKING ABOUT HIM JOINING THE TEA PARTY LAST YEAR.
NOW, WE DON'T KNOWS IF F THIS IS THE SAME JIM HOLMES, BUT IT IS
JIM HOLMES OF AURORA, COLORADO.
>> Stephen: IS A DAMNING ASSOCIATION FOR THE TEA PARTY MITIGATED ONLY BY THE FACT THAT
IT IS COMPLETELY INACCURATE.
(LAUGHTER) THANK YOU FOR THAT THOUGHTFUL AND HASTY GOOGLING, BRIAN.
TURNS OUT, THERE WAS A DIFFERENT JIM HOLMES, BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM BRIAN ROSS?
I GOOGLED HIM AND APPARENTLY BRIAN ROSS WAS RECENTLY ARRESTED FOR DISTRIBUTING METH WHILE
WORKING IN A NEBRASKA TACO TOWN RESTAURANT.
(LAUGHTER) THE SECRET CODE IS "I'D LIKE A CHIMICHANGA-- WITH EXTRA METH." (LAUGHTER)
NOW, NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN THE FINE ART OF POLITICAL FINGER-POINTING, MY COLLEAGUES
AT THE CONSERVATIVE WEB SITE Www.breitbart.com LANDED THE EXCLUSIVE SPECULATION "DARK
KNIGHT" AURORA, COLORADO,
SHOOTING SUSPECT COULD BE REGISTERED DEMOCRAT.
AH-HA!
A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT!
WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS!
WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
(LAUGHTER) STILL, GREAT REPORTING Www.breitbart.com.
RIVALED ONLY BY YOUR UPDATE "UPDATE, NOT REGISTERED?" NO SHAME THERE, BREITBART.
SO GREAT NEWS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PREMATURELY ASSOCIATED THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WITH
HORRIBLE CRIMES.
REMEMBER THE TRIBUNE'S FAMOUS HEADLINE "DEWEY KILLS TRUMAN." (LAUGHTER)
SO THERE WAS A TON OF INACCURATE INFORMATION I DO NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GIVE YOU.
BUT I MOST REGRET MISSING OUT ON ANALYZING ALL OF THAT NO INFORMATION.
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF 20-YEAR-OLDS WHO ARE LIVING IN THIS UNDERINSTITUTIONALIZED WORLD,
LONELY, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DEALING THEM.
AT THE SAME TIME A TREMENDOUS HUNGER FOR FAME AND YOU SEE THE RISE OF THESE SPECTACLE KILLINGS
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE A DEBATE ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: YES, WE NEED A LENGTHY DEBATE IN THE NEWS ABOUT HOW MUCH THESE PEOPLE HUNGER FOR
MEDIA COVERAGE.
ALL DAY, EVERYDAY UNTIL WE FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IS DRIVING THE SEARCH FOR ATTENTION!
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE WITH A STORY THIS DEVASTATING THERE'S NOT JUST NOTHING TO SAY.
EVIDENTLY THERE'S ALSO NOTHING TO DO.
ESPECIALLY NOTHING ABOUT GUNS.
>> NEW LEGISLATION IS A LONG SHOT, ESPECIALLY IN AN ELECTION YEAR.
>> THERE'S NOT REALLY A GUN CONTROL DEBATE IN POLITICS ANYMORE.
>> NO, THERE ISN'T.
I THINK THE ISSUE IS SETTLED.
>> THERE IS A CONSENSUS AS BOB SAID IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE FURTHER
ANY GUN CONTROL MEASURES PASSED BY THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.
IT'S A SETTLED ISSUE.
>> Stephen: YES, IT WAS SETTLED LONG BEFORE THIS TRAGEDY.
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WITH SOMETHING THIS TERRIBLE WE MIGHT HAVE FOOLISHLY REASSESSED ITS SETTLEDNESS.
BESIDES, WE NOW KNOW GUNS AREN'T THE REAL PROBLEM HERE
>> COSTUMES AND FACE MASKS ARE NOW BEING BANNED AT MOVIE HOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING
MORE THAN 300 AIPL SEE THEATERS.
>> SOME OF THE MOVIE THEATERS, I THINK A.M.C. HAS BANNED PEOPLE COMING IN WEARING MASKS.
>> FINALLY FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR STRICTER COSTUME CONTROL.
(LAUGHTER) BEFORE BUYING A SEXY NURSE OUTFIT, I BELIEVE SHE SHOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT TO A THOROUGH
BACKGROUND CHECK.
AND FRONT GROUND CHECK.
(LAUGHTER) BUT BESIDES ALL THE RAMPANT SPECULATION AND ILL-INFORMED COMMENTARY, SOME PEOPLE REACTED INAPPROPRIATELY.
>> THE AIRWAVES IN COLORADO ARE MISSING ATTACK AD THIS IS WEEKEND AFTER BOTH THE OBAMA
CAMPAIGN AND THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN REACHED OUT TO AFFILIATE T.V.
STATIONS IN THE CENTENNIAL STATE AND ASKED THEM TO PULL THEIR SO-CALLED CONTRAST SPOTS FOR THE
TIME BEING.
>> Stephen: OBAMA AND ROMNEY PULLED THEIR SPOTS.
FINALLY THIS GIVES ME SOMETHING NOTHING TO SAY.
GENTLEMEN, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
YOU CANNOT STOP YOUR ATTACK ADS EVERY TIME THERE IS A GUN CRIME!
THERE ARE NEARLY 9,000 GUN HOMICIDESS A YEAR IN AMERICA.
THAT MEANS 25 PEOPLE ARE MURDERED WITH GUNS EVERYDAY!
AND IF YOU'RE REALLY PULLING THOSE ADS DOWN TO BE SENSITIVE,
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN EVER RUN THEM AGAIN.
