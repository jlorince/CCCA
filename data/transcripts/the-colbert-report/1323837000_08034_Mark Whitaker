>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE MANAGING
EDITOR OF CNN WORLDWIDE HAS JUST
RELEASED A NEW MEMOIR "MY LONG
TRIP HOME."
GREAT, NOW I KNOW HOW IT ENDS.
PLEASE WELCOME MARK WHITAKER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MR. WHITAKER, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS
QUESTION BEFORE WE GO ON.
YOU'RE THE MANAGING EDITOR OF
CNN WORLDWIDE WHY DOES ANDERSON
COOPER HAVE SO MANY PHALLUSS ON
HIS SET?
YOU SAW THAT!
WELL, YOU KNOW HIS RATINGS ARE
UP.
>> Stephen: (LAUGHS)
OH, REALLY.
WILL THEY LAST FOR FOUR HOURS,
THOUGH?
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MANAGING EDITOR OF
CNN WORLDWIDE.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
CNN AND WORLDWIDE?
AREN'T THEY BOTH WORLDWIDE?
>> WELL, CNN WORLDWIDE IS THE
PARENT COMPANY OF THE DOMESTIC
NETWORK BUT ALSO THE
INTERNATIONAL NETWORK AND OUR
DIGITAL....
>> Stephen: WHY HAVE AN
INTERNATIONAL NETWORK?
YOU GUYS, MOST TRUSTED NAME IN
NEWS, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
WHY GIVE OUR NEWS TO PEOPLE IN
OTHER COUNTRIES?
(LAUGHTER)
WHY NOT KEEP THAT PRECIOUS
RESOURCE FOR AMERICA SO WE STAY
A SUPERPOWER?
>> WELL, WE ALSO THINK THAT IT'S
IMPORTANT FOR AMERICANS TO KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: DEFEND THAT
STATEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T CARE.
>> THERE'S A FINANCIAL CRISIS
THAT IF IT WENT THE WRONG WAY IT
WOULD MEAN THE MONEY IN YOUR
SAVINGS ACCOUNT MIGHT DISAPPEAR.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY I USE KAG
RANDS.
>> THERE'S THE ARAB SPRING.
KRUGERRANDS.
IT MIGHT AFFECT OUR
VULNERABILITY TO TERRORISM.
SO I THINK WE'RE CONNECTED WITH
THE REST OF THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: NOT JUST CNN, YOU
USED TO BE THE MANAGING EDITOR
OF "NEWSWEEK".
>> I WAS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
FOR SOME OF MY YOUNGER VIEWERS,
WHAT WAS A MAGAZINE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> A MAGAZINE WAS THIS THING
BETWEEN COVERS THAT YOU COULD
LEAF THROUGH WHERE WE DID
REPORTING ABOUT POLITICS, WE DID
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTINGS.
>> Stephen: LIKE A PRINTED I
HAD?
>> AND I'VE SAVED COPYS SO MY
GRANDCHILDREN WILL BELIEVE IT.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE MOVED ON TO A
MEMOIR.
YOUR BOOK IS CALLED "MY LONG
TRIP HOME.
A FAMILY MEMOIR."
YOU'RE THE PRODUCT OF A BIRACIAL
MARRIAGE.
YOUR MOTHER WAS A WHITE WOMAN
FROM FRANCE, YOUR FATHER AN
AFRICAN AMERICAN, A GIANT IN
ACADEMIA.
YOU... AIR SOME DIRTY LAUNDRY IN
HERE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.
AS THE PRODUCT OF A BIRACIAL
FAMILY, DON'T YOU HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY EVERYTHING
WAS JUST HUKKY DORY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE WHO
KNEW MY PARENTS-- MY FATHER CAME
FROM SEGREGATED BLACK PITTSBURGH
BECAME AS YOU SAID A GROUND
BREAKING SCHOLAR OF AFRICA.
THE FIRST BLACK Ph.D. IN
POLITICS FROM PRINCETON.
MY MOTHER CAME FROM FRANCE
DURING THE NAZI OCCUPATION ON A
BOAT 14 YEARS OLD WITH FIVE
YOUNGER SISTERS, REFUGEES.
HER FATHER, MY FRENCH
GRANDFATHER, HELPED HIDE
THOUSANDS OF JEWS FROM THE NAZIS
DURING THE WAR.
AND THEY WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT
THIS.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO KNEW THERE
WAS AN UNHAPPIER PART OF THE
STORY THAT HAPPENED AFTER MY
PARENTS GOT DIVORCED, MY MOTHER
HAD TO STRUGGLE AS A SINGLE
MOTHER, MY FATHER BECAME AN
ALCOHOLIC.
I BECAME OBESE.
>> Stephen: YOU BECAME OBESE?
>> I BECAME OBESE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE AIRING
ENORMOUS DIRTY LAUNDRY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BUT THE STORY IS ABOUT HOW WE
ALL RECOVERED FROM THAT AND WE
EVENTUALLY REACHED
RECONCILIATION AND FORGIVENESS.
IT'S INTERESTING, NOW THAT THE
BOOK IS OUT IT'S THAT PART OF
THE STORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE CONNECTING TO.
>> Stephen: DID YOU FEEL LIKE AS
A CHILD OF PARENTS WHO PERHAPS
WERE NOT PERFECT, DO YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU ARE BETRAYING THEM IN
SOME WAY?
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT MY KIDS
TO WRITE THINGS ABOUT ME THAT...
IN WASN'T IN THE MOST GLOWING
TERMS.
AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR
ABOUT THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I CONSIDER A BOOK TO A
TRIBUTE TO MY PARENTS.
MY MOTHER WAS THE SOURCE.
MY FATHER... I STARTED WRITING
THIS BOOK AFTER MY FATHER
PASSEDED AWAY.
IN FACT, IT WAS A YEAR AFTER HE
PASSED AWAY TO THE DAY TO THE
HOUR THAT I WOKE UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND DECIDED
THAT I WANTED TO WRITE THE
STORY.
I WROTE TO ENTIRE BOOK WITHOUT
HAVING AN ADVANCE OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
I JUST FELT THAT I HAD TO DO IT.
BUT MY MOTHER WAS A SOURCE FOR
THE BOOK AND SHE WILLINGLY
TALKED ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS
AND WHEN I SENT HER THE THIRD
DRAFT SHE FINALLY SAID "WELL,
THIS ISN'T BADLY WRITTEN,
EITHER."
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YOU SAID "YES,
MOTHER, I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF
THE LEADING LIGHTS OF AMERICAN
JOURNALIST."
>> SHE'S A FRENCH LITERATURE
PROFESSOR SO IT'S HIGH PRIZE FOR
HER.
>> Stephen: DO YOU FEEL GROWING
UP... I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE
IDEA OF BEING THE SEWN OF A
BIRACIAL COUPLE.
DID AWFUL SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO BE A GOOD OR EXCEPTIONAL OR
TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF
SOMETHING?
>> I FELT-- AND I THINK MY
YOUNGER BROTHER FELT-- LIKE
ALIENS.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE WHO
WAS MIXED RACE BUT I... YOU KNOW
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK
YOU SEE... THE STORY OF THE
FAMILY UNFOLDS BUT YOU ALSO SEE
THE STORY OF AMERICA UNFOLD.
FROM A POINT WHERE AT THE
BEGINNING OF A BOOK THESE TWO
PEOPLE MEET AND MARRY AT A TIME
WHEN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IS
STILL ILLEGAL IN MOST STATES IN
NEW YORK THE END OF THE BOOK
WHERE JUST BEFORE MY FATHER HAS
DIED A MIXED RACE MAN IS ELECTED
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SO IT'S A FAMILY STORY BUT ALSO
THE STORY OF THE COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SHARNG.
MARK WHITAKER, THE BOOK IS
