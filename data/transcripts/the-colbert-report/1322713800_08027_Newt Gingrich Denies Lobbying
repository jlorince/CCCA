[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, THE 2012 ELECTION IS
BARRELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF ROAD
BECAUSE THE IOWA CAUCUS IS JUST
OVER A MONTH AWAY, AND MY MAN
NEWT GINGRICH IS LEADING IN BOTH
LOCAL AND NATIONAL POLLS.
THAT MEANS MITT ROMNEY HAS VERY
LITTLE TIME LEFT TO EXECUTE HIS
PROVEN STRATEGY OF SAYING AND
DOING NOTHING WHILE THE GUY
AHEAD OF HIM IN THE POLLS
DESTROYS HIMSELF IN SOME
SPECTACULAR AND UNFORSEEN
MANNER.
LET'S SAY, BY GAY MARRYING A
BURNING AMERICAN FLAG.
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING GOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WILL THIS UNFORESEEN DISASTER
HAPPEN TO GINGRICH?
THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS DOING THEIR
BEST -- ACCUSING HIM OF SHADY
LOBBYING DEALS.
>> AS NEWT GINGRICH RISES IN THE
POLLS THERE'S GROWING SCRUTINY
INTO HIS WORK AFTER HE LEFT
CONGRESS.
THE TIMES REPORTS THAT THROUGH
HIS HEALTH CARE CONSULTANCY THE
FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER MADE
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HELPING
COMPANIES PROMOTE THEIR SERVICES
WHILE GAINING ACCESS TO
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
>> STEPHEN: THAT IS AN
OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATION THAT A
-- YES, BOO.
HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE OF A
CONGRESSMAN WITH NO DISCERNIBLE
SKILLS OF RAINING IN CASH BY
RAKING IN CASH AND FUTURE FELLOW
LOBBYISTS.
WE KNOW THIS ISN'T TRUE BECAUSE
AS NEWT'S AIDES HAVE POINTED
OUT, HE IS NOT A REGISTERED
LOBBYIST.
IF HE IS NOT REGISTERED, ERGO
HE'S NOT A LOBBYIST.
THE SAME REASON THAT I HAVE NOT
REGISTERED MY AUDI A-8, SO
LEGALLY IT'S NOT A CAR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHICH IS WHY I CAN DRIVE IT ON
THE SIDEWALK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TODAY, NEWT CATEGORICALLY DENIED
THESE SCURRILOUS ACCUSATIONS.
>>  I DID NO LOBBYING OF ANY
KIND, PERIOD.
FOR A PRACTICAL REASON.
LET ME BE REALLY DIRECT, OKAY?
I WAS CHARGING $60,000 A SPEECH.
AND THE NUMBERS OF SPEECHES WAS
GOING UP, NOT DOWN.
NORMALLY CELEBRITIES SELL FEWER
SPEECHES.
WE WERE SELLING MORE.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY?
HE DOESN'T NEED TO LOBBY--HE'S A
CELEBRITY.
HE'S BIGGER THAN
BRANGELINA AND TOMKAT PUT
TOGETHER -- OR AT LEAST HIS HEAD
IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
$60K A SPEECH.
AS HIS ATTORNEY EXPLAINS:
NONE OF MR. GINGRICH'S CLIENTS
PAID HIM TO ADOPT A POSITION
THAT HE DID NOT ALREADY HAVE.
>> STEPHEN:  YES, COMPANIES
FREQUENTLY PAY CELEBRITIES LIKE
US TO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WHAT
WE ALREADY BELIEVE.
FOR INSTANCE, IT HAS BEEN MY
LONG-HELD POSITION THAT IF
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ALL-OUT
REFRESHMENT BUD LIGHT LIME
OFFERS UP THE JUST-RIGHT TASTE
YOU LOVE WITH A SPLASH OF 100%
NATURAL LIME FLAVOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S JUST WHO I AM.
I GREW UP FEELING STRONGLY THAT
BUD LIGHT LIME IS PERFECT FOR
CHILLING AT THE POOL, IN THE
BACKYARD, OR PRETTY MUCH
ANYWHERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT BEING PAID TO SAY THAT.
I RECEIVE MONEY FROM THE GOOD
FOLKS AT BUD LIGHT LIME BECAUSE
I HAPPEN TO ALREADY THINK THAT
BUD LIGHT LIME IS THE OFFICIAL
BEER OF NATURAL GOOD TIMES.
[ LAUGHTER ]sAND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE T
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH GOOD TIMES FOR
NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
