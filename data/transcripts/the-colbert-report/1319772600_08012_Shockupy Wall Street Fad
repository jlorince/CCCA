(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEVEEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THAT CAME OUT
VERY NICELY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY
YOU ARE CHANTING YOU WOULD
THINK I WAS FAMOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, IT IS A DARK DAY IN
AMERICA.
OUR WAY OF LIFE IS UNDER
ATTACK FROM THE YOUTH-STAPO
OVER AT SHOCK-UPY WALL
STREET, TRADEMARKED.
WE KNEW THEY WERE COMPLETELY
AIMLESS AND UNTO KUTSD.
NOW WE KNOW THEY ARE
VIOLENT.
ON TUESDAY IN OAKLAND,
CALIFORNIA, PROTESTORS THREW
ROCKS AND BOTTLES AT POLICE
FORCING THE COPS TO RESPOND
WITH THEIR OWN IMPROVISED
WEAPONS.
TEAR GAS CANISTERS, FLASH
GRENADES AND BEAN BAG GUNS.
BEAN BAG GUNS?
REALLY, BEAN BAGS?
THAT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A
HIGH VELOCITY MACKEY SACK
YOU ARE PLAYING RIGHT NOT
PROTESTORS' HANDS.
AND FEET.
NOW TRAGICALLY, FOLKS, ONE
OF THE PROTESTS INJURED WAS
AN ACTUAL AMERICAN.
IRAQI WAR VET SCOTT OLSEN
WAS HIT IN THE HEAD WITH A
TEAR GAS CANISTER AND WHEN
PROTESTORS RUSHED TO HIS AID
POLICE TOSSED A FLASH
GRENADE NOT GROUP AND
OLSEN'S SKULL WAS FRACTURED.
OLSEN IS IN THE HOSPITAL NOW
AWAITING BRAIN SURGERY.
AND WE WISH HIM WELL.
BUT FOLKS, WHILE THIS
FOOTAGE RIGHT HERE MAY BE
SHOCKING, I BELIEVE
YESTERDAY'S "WASHINGTON
POST" GAVE THE FULL STORY
WITH THIS PICTURE OF AN
OAKLAND POLICEMAN PETTING A
KITTEN.
(LAUGHTER)
MAKING THE POINT THAT WHILE
OAKLAND'S FINEST MAY HAVE
SHATTERED A VETERAN'S SKULL,
THEY'RE ALSO CAPABLE OF
POLICE CUTE-AALITY, ALSO
TRADEMARKED.
NOW FOLKS I BELIEVE IN THE
CONSTITUTION.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T
HAVE THE RIGHT TO PEACEFULLY
ASSEMBLE.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE
POLICE HAVE THE RIGHT TO
DISASSEMBLE YOU INTO PIECES.
LOVE
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE HEADLINE SUMS UP THE
SITUATION PERFECTLY.
PROTESTORS WEARING OUT
WELCOME, NATIONWIDE.
YEAH, PROTESTORS, YOU'RE
WEARING OUT YOUR WELCOME.
YOU'RE LIKE THE ONE DUDE AT
2 A.M. STILL SITTING ON
AMERICA'S COUCH.
THE PITTY PARTY IS OVER, GO
HOME.
SO WALL STREET CAN CONTINUE
THEIR PARTY.
WE'RE GOING TO SNORT THE
GROUND UP BONES OF THE POOR.
FEELS GOOD IT IS GOOD.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FRANKLY-- FRANKLY, THE WHOLE
COUNTRY IS SICK OF OCCUPY
WALL STREET.
PARTICULARLY THAT PART OF
THE COUNTRY THAT HAS CABLE
NEWS SHOWS.
>> PUTTING UP WITH A BUNCH
OF ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW
CRACKING DOWN MORE ON THE
OCCUPY WALL STREET PROTEST.
>> IS THIS A SIGN THAT THE
MOVEMENT'S DAYS COULD BE
COMING TO AN END.
>> A LOT OF CITIES LIKE
ATLANTA, OAKLAND EVEN NEW
YORK CITY SAYING WE REALLY
HAD ENOUGH OF THIS THIS HAS
GONE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
>> SOME MUNICIPALITIES AND
CITIES ARE SAYING YOU KNOW
WHAT, I ENOUGH, ENOUGH.
>> THE COST, DISEASE, FUNGUS.
>> YEAH.
IF WALL STREET WANTS FUNGUS,
WE'LL HAVE OUR CHEF SHAVE A
LITTLE WHITE TRUFFLE ON OUR
RISOTTO BIANCO.
LOOK.
YOU HAD YOUR MOMENT IN THE
SUN, PROTESTORS.
AND YOUR MOMENT IN THE RAIN
AND THE WIND AND THE COLD.
BUT WE ARE BORED WITH YOU
NOW.
YOU ARE JUST A MEDIA FAD
LIKE SANJAYA, OR BALLOON BOY,
OR BALLOON SANJAYA.
(LAUGHTER)
WORST MACY'S PARADE EVER.
BESIDES OCCUPY WALL STREET
WORKED.
TODAY THE DOW WAS UP 340 DOW
POINTS.
FINANCIAL SYSTEM FIXED.
THANK YOU.
NOW GO OCCUPY SOMETHING ELSE.
THERE MUST BE SOME INJUSTICE
HAPPENING SOMEWHERE.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
I THINK SOMEBODY'S TESTING
LIPSTICK ON A DOLPHIN.
QUICK, GO OCCUPY THE
