MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, NATION, IF YOU ASK ME,
THERE HAS BEEN WAY TOO MUCH HIS STAIRA ABOUT THIS OIL SPILL IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.
NOW, THOSE IMAGES MAY BE DISTURBING, BUT REMEMBER, AT LEAST IT'S NOT FOREIGN OIL.
EVERYONE JUST HAS TO COOL THEIR JET FUEL.
LIKE RUSH LIMBAUGH.
>> THE OCEAN WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS ON ITS OWN IF IT WAS LEFT ALONE AND IF IT WAS LEFT OUT THERE.
IT'S NATURAL.
IT'S AS NATURAL AS THE OCEAN WATER IS.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, EL US RUSH BOW.
OIL IS AS NATURAL AS OCEAN WATER, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY OIL.
BESIDES, B.P. IS COMMITTED TO CLEANING UP THE PROBLEM BY LOWERING A DOME OVER THE LIKE TO
SUCK UP THE OIL AS IT COMES OUT.
IN FACT, B.P.'S ENGINEERS HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A DIGITAL RENDERING OF THE PROPOSED
UNDERSEA DOME.
JIM.
[LAUGHTER]
APPARENTLY...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY TO SOAK UP THE OIL THERE IS A SPONGE INSIDE.
[LAUGHTER]
ACCORDING TO A SPOKESMAN,
ABSORBENT AND YELLOW AND POROUS IS HE.
NOW, THAT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION.
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PERMANENT SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS CAUSED BY DRILLING.
>> TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF THE BLOWN-OUT WELL.
B.P. SAYS CREWS WILL BEGIN DRILLING ON THURSDAY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, MR. DRILLING.
REMEMBER, NO MATTER WHAT THE PROBLEM, THE SOLUTION IS ALWAYS "DRILL, BABY, DRILL."
DRILL, BABY, DRILL.
DRILL, BABY DRILL.
DRILL, BABY DRILL.
BY THE WAY, DO NOT TAKE YOUR BABY WHERE THEY ARE DRILLING.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME JUST ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS DRILLING AND RELIEVING PRESSURE THING IS GOING TO WORK.
LET'S SAY THIS IS THE GULF OF MEXICO RIGHT THERE, AND THIS BAG OF OIL IS THE SEABED.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, THESE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS ARE A DRILL.
NOW, WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A BLOWN-OUT... YOU'VE GOT A BLOWN-OUT WELL HEAD RIGHT THERE.
SO THIS IS POURING.
YOU CAN SEE THAT.
THAT'S POURING IN RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S COMING OUT REALLY FAST BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE HOLE.
TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF, WE'RE GOING TO PUT ANOTHER HOLE IN RIGHT THERE, AND THIS IS GOING.
.. OOPSY DAISY.
WE'LL PROBABLY PUT ANOTHER ONE IN BACK OVER THERE THE TRY TO KEEP THE... THAT IS... ALL RIGHT.
WELL, NOW, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS DO ANOTHER HOLE OVER HERE TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OFF OF
THOSE TWO.
AND THEN YOU WANT TO GET THAT BACK IN.
GET THAT BACK INTO THE...
[LAUGHTER]
UM, JIMMY!
JIMMY, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO HERE?
SHOULD WE JUST LOWER THE DOME?
WE DON'T HAVE A DOME?
WELL,||||||
