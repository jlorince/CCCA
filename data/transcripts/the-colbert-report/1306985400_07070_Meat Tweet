FOLKS, As A NEWSMAN, IT'S MY
DUTY TO KEEP YOU INFORM ABOUT
THE SWELLING CONTROVERSY THAT
HAS CAST A LENGTHY SHADOW OVER
NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN ANTHON
WEINER.
STRETCHING THE FABRIC OF OUR
NATIONAL DISCOURSE AND THAT
ROBBING LIKE A... HE TWEETED A
PICTURE OF HIS SCHWANTZ.
ALLEGEDLY, ALLEGEDLY.
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW, FOLKS.
FIRST OF ALL, HE'S NOT A
REPUBLICAN.
SECOND, HE'S CIRCUMCISED.
THIRD, FOUR DAYS AGO
REPRESENTATIVE WEINER'S TWITTER
"SENT A TWITPIC TO A FEMALE
COLLEGE STUDENT OVER THE
TWITTER.
NOW, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE
PHOTO RIGHT NOW.
SO SEND YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE
ROOM IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO
GROW UP WITH MASSIVE INFERIORITY
COMPLEX.
[LAUGHTER]
JIM.
YOWZA.
HOW DID HE EVEN TWEET THAT
THING?
THAT'S AT LEAST 150 CHARACTERS.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THE CONGRESSMAN
CLAIMS HE WAS HACKED AND HAS
DENIED RESPONSIBILITY, BUT THE
QUESTION REMAINS: IS THIS OR IS
THIS NOT REPRESENTATIVE WEINER'S
CHIEF OF STAFF?
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
FOLKS.
THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A
DENIAL TO ME.
JIM?
>> YOU CAN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY
WHETHER IT'S YOU OR NOT.
>> I CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT I
DID NOT SEND THIS.
>> THAT'S NOT A PICTURE OF YOU?
>> I CAN'T SAY WITH CERTITUDE.
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK
FAMILIAR WITH ME, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO SAY WITHER ISTUDE.
>> I SEE ONLY TWO OPTIONS HERE,
EITHER ANTHON WEINER HAS TOO
MANY PHOTOS OF HIS CROTCH TO
KEEP TRACK, OR CERTITUDE IS HIS
NICKNAME FOR HIS PENIS.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I HOPE WE GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS SOON, BUT IN THE
MEANTIME, IT MUST BE A DIFFICULT
TIME FOR THE CONGRESSMAN.
MY SYMPATHY AND/OR ENVY GOES OUT
TO HIM.
HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND.
JUST WANT TO... ONE THING.
AND...
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND... AND TWEET.
