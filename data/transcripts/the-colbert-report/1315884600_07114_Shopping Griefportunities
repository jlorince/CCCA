>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, IT WAS A TENSE
WEEKEND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
ON THURSDAY ANOTHER
TERRORIST THREAT HAD NEW
YORK CITY ON HIGH ALERT.
PLUS THIS WEEKEND TWO
DIFFERENT AIRPLANES RECEIVED
FIGHTER JET ESCORTS AMID
REPORTS OF SUSPICIOUS
ACTIVITY BY PASSENGERS.
ON ONE FLIGHT THE TROUBLE
WAS THREE PASSENGERS WHO
MADE REPEATED BATHROOM TRIPS
AND ON THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE
SPENDING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT
OF TIME IN A BATHROOM.
FOLKS, THIS IS WHY I HAVE
LONG CALLED FOR REMOVING
BATHROOMS FROM AIRPLANES.
IF YOU CAN'T HOLD IT FOR SIX
HOURS, TAKE A BOAT.
IT'S ON A BATHROOM.
OR YOU CAN JUST MAKE EVERY
SEAT A TOILET.
THAT WAY THE UNDERWEAR
BOMBER HAS GOT TO SHOW US
WHAT THEY GOT, PLUS YOU CAN
PEE IN TURBULENCE WITHOUT
BECOMING AN OSCILLATING
SPRINKLER.
OF COURSE, THIS IS ALL
BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS THE
TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11.
NOW AS A BROADCASTER I AM
OBLIGATED TO REMIND YOU HOW
YOU FELT BACK THEN.
YOU WERE SAD.
AND TEN YEARS ON WE NEED TO
ASK OURSELVES HAVE WE AS A
NATION RECOVERED.
WELL, I WASN'T SURE UNTIL I
SAW ALL THIS GREAT 9/11
COMMEMORATIVE STUFF YOU CAN
BUY.
I'M TALKING ABOUT 9/11 SHOES.
9/11 CRIBBAGE BOARDS, 9/11
DOG COLORS, EVEN A 9/11
CHESS SET HONORING THE
POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO
I ASSUME FOUGHT TO CAPTURE
EACH OTHER'S KINGS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> FOLKS, THESE TERRORISTS
ATTACKED US BECAUSE THEY
HATED OUR WAY OF LIFE.
AND WHAT TYPIFIES OUR WAY OF
LIFE MORE THAN SELLING EACH
OTHER USELESS CRAP MADE IN
CHINA.
IF WE CAN EXPLOIT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IF WE CAN EXPLOIT THIS
ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR ATTACK
TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK, WE
WIN.
THAT'S HITTING THE
TERRORISTS WITH ECONOMIC
JIUJITSU.
AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY FEEL
ABOUT THE JEWS.
NOW ONE-- ONE SHOPPING
GREASE-PORTUNI I LIKE COMES
FROMLY SELLERS WHO WERE
OFFERING COMMEMORATIVE
BOTTLE-- BOTTLES OF 9/11
WINE.

(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU WILL WAKE UP THE NEXT
MORNING--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU WILL WAKE UP THE NEXT
MORNING SAYING MY GOD, HOW
MUCH DID I REMEMBER LAST
NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND NO, BEFORE YOU ASK IT

YOU DON'T WANT TO HONOR THE
HEROES WITH SOME CHEAP ASS
$9 WINE.
BESIDES, THE SELLERS STATE
THEY ARE DONATING 6 TO 10%
