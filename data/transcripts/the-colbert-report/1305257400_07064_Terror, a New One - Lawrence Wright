(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: OF COURSE NO ONE
CAN REALLY SAY WHAT THE
FUTURE HOLDS FOR AL QAEDA.
HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THE
FUTURE HOLDS FOR AL QAEDA IS
NEW YORKER WRITER AND THE
AUTHOR OF THE LOOMING TOWER,
AL QAEDA AND THE ROAD TO
9/11, PLEASE WELCOME
LAWRENCE WRIGHT, LAWRENCE,
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY LAWRENCE, WHAT WITHER
NOW AL QAEDA.
THEY'VE LOST THEIR FRONTMAN.
IS THIS LIKE VAN HALL EN?
HAVE WE KILLED DAVID LEE
ROTH?
IS THERE A SAMMY HAGAR
WAITING IN THE WINGS?
OR MORE OF A GARY SHARRON
TYPE?
>> IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
FOR THEM.
THEY ARE FACING AN
EXISTENTIAL MOMENT BECAUSE
THEY'VE BEEN DRIFTING FOR
YEARS.
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
PULL OFF A BIGGER TRACK LIKE,
THEY'VE BEEN WANTING TO EVER
SINCE 9/11.
IF THEY CAN'T PULL OFF
SOMETHING IN THE NEXT YEAR,
THEY'RE GOING TO SEEM REALLY
IRRELEVANT.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S
MAKE-OR-BREAK FOR THOSE GUYS
RIGHT NOW.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THERE IS NO
TOMORROW.
>> THERE ARE OTHER TEAMS OUT
THERE THAT ARE CONTENDING
FOR THE CROWN.
>> Stephen: WHO ARE THE
OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE?
WHO SHOULD I BE-- BECAUSE AS
I SAID T TER FEWS ME TO NOT
BE SCARED.
WHO SHOULD I BE SCARED OF
NEXT?
>> BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP
OUR GUARD UP.
>> I DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON ANWAR
AL-AWLAKI.
WHEN THE FIRST WAVE OF AL
QAEDA HIJACKERS CAME TO
AMERICA IN JANUARY OF 2000,
THEY WENT TO SAN DIEGO WHERE
HE WAS THE IMAM.
AND THEN THEY FOLLOWED HIM
ALL ACROSS AMERICA.
HE WENT TO BECOME THE
CHAPLIN AT GEORGE WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY.
THEY FOLLOWED HIM.
SO HE HAS BEEN CONNECTED
WITH THIS GROUP FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING.
>> Stephen: IS THERE, WHAT
DOES IT TAKE TO BE THE
LEADER OF AL QAEDA?
I MEAN DO YOU NEED PEOPLE
SKILLS.
IS IT MORE ADMINISTRATIVE.
DO YOU HAVE TO DO A
SPREADSHEET.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR.
>> THEY NEED AN INSPIRATIONAL
FIGURE WHO CAN RAISE MONEY
RZ.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THAT IS WHAT BIN LADEN
DID.
HE BROUGHT MONEY TO THE
TABLE.
THAT'S THE REASON PEOPLE
GRAVITATED AROUND HIM.
ESPECIALLY, THE NUMBER TWO
GUY, HE HAD HIS OWN
TERRORIST GROUP BUT THEY
SPOTTED THIS YOUNG RICH
SAUDI AND THEY DECIDED TO
ORGANIZE AROUND HIM.
>> Stephen: NOW DO YOU THINK
THERE IS ANY BENEFIT TO
SHOWING THE PHOTOGRAPH OF
BIN LADEN OTHER THAN MAKING
SURE THIS YEAR'S FAVORITE
HALLOWEEN COSTUME IS
ACCURATE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A
LOT OF IMPROVISATION ON THAT
FRONT.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I THINK THAT, I UNDERSTAND
THE PRESIDENT'S RELUCTANCE
TO DO THAT.
AND IT WILL STIR UP A LOT OF
ANGRY FEELINGS THAT WE DON'T
NEED ANY MORE OF THAT RIGHT
NOW.
I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO
CALM TENSIONS.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK THAT
THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
EAST WOULD TO THE LIKE IT.
>> I'M PRETTY SURE OF IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHERE IS THE NEW CENTER FOR
THE WAR ON TERROR?
IS IT YEMEN?
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S-- THE
CENTER OF GRAVITY IS MOVING
TO YEMEN.
AND-- .
>> Stephen: WILL WE ENJOY
INVADING THERE?
>> IT'S A SMALLER COUNTRY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHEN BIN LADEN
WAS IN AFGHANISTAN WE
INVADED IRAQ.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT WE KNOW
HE WAS IN PAKISTAN, SHOULD
WE INNOVATE IRAQ AGAIN?
-- INVADE IRAQ AGAIN?
>> YOU DON'T THINK THEY
LEARNED THEIR LESSON.
COULD BE.
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY
TO INVADE FEWER COUNTRIES
RIGHT NOW.
I THINK WE'RE REALLY
OVEREXTENDED.
AND THIS IS A GOOD MOMENT
WITH BIN LADEN BEING DEAD,
TO BEGIN TO TRY TO REASSESS
OUR RELATIONSHIP IN THAT
PART OF THE WORLD AND MAYBE
BEGIN TO REDUCE SOME OF OUR
FORCES.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A
CHANCE OF THE WAR ON TERROR
IS OVER?
>> YOU KNOW, TERRORISM IS
NEVER GOING TO END.
BUT IT IS-- .
>> Stephen: SO IT'S NOT.
>> A LOT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS
ARE GOING TO BE IMLATING AL
QAEDA'S MODEL IN THE FUTURE.
SO WE'LL HAVE THIS PROBLEM
PROBABLY FOREVER NOW.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
THAT CHEERFUL THOUGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
