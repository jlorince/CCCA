AMERICA.
>> Stephen:  FERTHU HAL,
ROMNEY, FERTHU HAL.
OF COURSE, FOR MORE EVIDENCE THAT OBAMA DOESN'T GET AMERICA,
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN HIS NEW AD ATTACKING SUCCESS.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S PLAN WOULD CUT TAXES FOR THE FOLKS AT THE VERY TOP.
I BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY TO CREATE AN ECONOMY BUILT TO LAST IS TO STRENGTHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS,
ASKING THE WEALTH TOW PAY A LITTLE MORE SO WE CAN PAY DOWN OUR DEBT IN A BALANCED WAY.
>> Stephen:  OH, YOU WANT TO ASK THE WEALTHY TO PAY A LITTLE MORE.
IT NEVER HURTS TO ASK.
LET ME JUST SEE WHAT'S IN MY CHECKBOOK.
NO!
( APPLAUSE ) THIS AD IS JUST A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO WALK BACK OBAMA'S
BLUNDER FROM TWO WEEKS AGO WHERE HE LET SLIP HIS TRUE VISION FOR THIS COUNTRY.
>> IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL,
SOMEBODY ALONG THE LINE GAVE YOU?
HELP.
SOMEBODY INVESTED IN ROADS AND BRIDGES.
IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS, THAT-- YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
>> Stephen:  THAT IS OFFENSIVE!
I DON'T WANT A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS A LEG UP COMES FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS A LEG UP COMES FROM HIS DAD.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND LISTEN TO MITT HAMMER OBAMA ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
>> THE IDEA TO SAY THAT STEVE JOBS DIDN'T BUILD APPLE, THAT
HENRY FORD DIDN'T BUILD FORD MOTOR, THAT-- THAT-- THAT PAPA JOHN DIDN'T BUILD PAPA JOHN
PIZZA IS INSULTING TO EVERY ENTREPRENEUR, EVERY INNOVATOR IN AMERICA.
>> Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MORE INSULTING THAT
OBAMA IS SAYING PAPA JOHN DIDN'T CREATE HIS BUSINESS OR THAT SOMEONE IS CALLING THIS PIZZA.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, FOLKS, NO SURPRISE, NO SURPRISE, FOLKS.
OBAMA WAS DEFENDED BY SOME FAR-LEFT KOOKS, LIKE MITT ROMNEY.
>> I KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE HELPED YOU?
A BUSINESS-- PERHAPS THE BANKS,
THE INVESTORS.
THERE'S NO QUESTION YOUR MOM,
YOUR DAD, YOUR SCHOOL TEACHERS,
THE PEOPLE THAT PROVIDE ROADS THE FIRE, THE POLICE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HELP.
>> Stephen:  HEY, MITT, I KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S RUNNING
BUT CAN I GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT?
IF YOUR ENTIRE STUMP SPEECH,
YOUR ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS BASED ON SOMETHING THE OTHER GUY SAID,
WHENEVER POSSIBLE TRY NOT TO AGREE WITH HIM BECAUSE SUCCESS NEVER COMES FROM OTHER PEOPLE.
TAKE ME.
I BUILT THIS SHOW OUT OF NOTHING.
I GAVE IT MY BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS, AND A STOOL SAMPLE.
( LAUGHTER ) VIACOM HAS A VERY STRICT DRUG TESTING PROGRAM.
I SACRIFICE, I SUFFERED, BUT I GREW A THICK SKIN AND BECAME A TOUGH-AS-NAILS SHARK WHO IS
STOPPED BY NOTHING AND NO ONE!
SO WHEN YOU SAY I GOT HELP, IT HURTS MY FEELINGS.
( LAUGHTER ).
THE ONLY ACCOMPLISHMENT I VALUE OR THE ONES I PRODUCE ENTIRELY BY MYSELF.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT THAT CRAZY ABOUT MY CHILDREN.
( LAUGHTER ) BUT NOW-- BUT NOW, NOW I AM BEING TOLD THAT MY PEABODYS AND
MY EMMIES ARE SOMEHOW THE WORK OF NOT JUST ME BUT ALSO MY 100 EMPLOYEES WORKING TOGETHER
THROUGH BRUTAL HOURS TO MAKE 161 EPISODES A YEAR WITH A COMM
