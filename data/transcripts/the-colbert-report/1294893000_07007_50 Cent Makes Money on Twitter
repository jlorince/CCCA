( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, I...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT KIND OF... THAT KIND OF
ACCOLADE, THAT KIND OF ACCOLADE
JUST MAKES ME FEEL YOUNG.
IT TAKES ME BACK TO MY EARLY
DAYS AS A WRESTLER.
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS, I STILL GOT IT.
I STILL GOT IT.
FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, THANKS
FOR CHEERING ME UP BECAUSE I
FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT, AND THAT'S
RARE.
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAYING IT, BUT
I RARELY FEEL IT, AND HERE'S
WHY: I HAVE MISSED THE BOAT ON
PERHAPS THE GREATEST FINANCIAL
OPPORTUNITY OF MY LIFE.
JIMMY, BREAK MY HEART.
>> RAPPER 50 CENT MADE A BIG
CHUNK OF CHANGE BY TWEETING.
HE REPORTEDLY RAKED IN MORE THAN
$8 MILLION BY GIVING A BUSINESS
AN ONLINE SHOUT-OUT.
THE KICKER HERE IS THAT HE OWNS
A BIG CHUNK OF THE COMPANY.
THE STOCK WOUND UP JUMPING FROM
10 CENTS TO 35 CENTS TO 40
CENTS.
>> Stephen: IT WENT FROM 10
CENTS TO 40 CENTS.
THAT'S WHY HE'S FIDDY CENT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THAT'S JUST MATH.
THAT'S JUST MATH.
SO WHAT HOT FIRE DID FIDDY SPIT
TO MAKE IT RAIN $8 MILLION
DOLLAR, DOLLAR BILLS, Y'ALL?
JIMMY, DROP THAT TWEET.
HE TWEETED HNHI IS THE STOCK
SYMBOL FOR TVG.
THEY'RE LAUNCHING 15 DIFFERENT
PRODUCTS.
THEY ARE NO JOKE.
GET IN NOW.
AND YOU KNOW HE'S RELIABLE
BECAUSE THAT IS TWICE AS MANY
GUNS AS ON THE CHARLES SCHWAB
PAGE.
( LAUGHTER )
THE POINT IS, FIDDY MADE 8
MA-ZILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT EVEN
USING ALL 140 CHARACTERS.
HE COULD HAVE MADE AN EXTRA HALF
MILL JUST BY ADDING ROTFL, WHICH
IN THIS CASE WOULD STAND FOR
RADICALLY OVERSTEPPING THE
FINANCIAL LAWS.
JIM.
>> I'M PRETTY SURE PUMPING AND
DUTCHING COULD BE AT LEAST
CONCEIVED AS UNETHICAL, BUT
CERTAINLY IT MIGHT BE ILLEGAL,
TOO.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT BUYING 30
MILLION SHARES OF A PENNY STOCK
AND THEN INSTRUCTING YOUR
TWITTER FOLLOWERS TO RUN UP THE
PRICE.
NEITHER DOES FIDDY.
IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE TWO DAYS
LATER HE TWEETED, "I OWN HNHI
STOCK.
THOUGHTS ON IT ARE MY OPINION.
TALK TO FINANCIAL ADVISER ABOUT
IT."
SOME SAY THIS DISCLAIMER PROVES
HE KNOWS THIS STEPPED OVER THE
LINE, BUT, NO HIS LYRICS HAVE
DISCLAIMERS, TOO, LIKE "A BITCH
CAN'T GET A DOLLAR OUT OF ME,
BUT TALK TO YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER."
SOUND ADVICE.
SOUND ADVICE.
ALSO, SEC, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND
STARTING A BEEF WITH FIDDY
CORRECT.
JUST ASK JA RULE, JADAKISS,
KAMYRON, RICK ROSS, THE GAME,
YOUNG BUCK AND OLD DIRTY
BERNANKE.
( APPLAUSE )
PLUS, PLUS YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TRUST FIDDY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
FIDDY IS SHORT FOR FIDELITY
INVESTMENTS.
HERE'S WHY I FEEL STUPID, FOLKS.
I AM THE KING OF TWITTER.
BIZ STONE GAVE ME THE FIRST EVER
GOLDEN TWEET AWARD FOR HAVING
THE MOST RETWEETED TWEET OF
2010.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND I HAVE MERELY TWO MILLION
FOLLOWERS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVEN'T ABUSED
THEIR TRUST TO MAKE MILLIONS OFF
WORTHLESS PENNY STOCKS.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, THAT ENDS TONIGHT, FOLKS.
FIRST, TO HELL WITH PENNY
STOCKS.
I SAY INVEST IN THE REAL THING.
PENNIES.
OKAY.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
IF YOU'VE GOT A DOLLAR BILL, YOU
CAN BUY 100 OF THEM.
THAT'S A 10,000% INCREASE RIGHT
THERE.
THAT'S GOT TO MEAN PROFITS.
SO HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.
BUY PENNIES.
I JUST CORNERED THE PENNY
MARKET.
THESE THINGS ARE WORTH A
FORTUNE.
ANYWAY, ANYWAY...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CONGRATULATIONS, FIDDY, FOR
FINDING A WAY TO MAKE MONEY OFF
TWITTER.
THAT IS SOMETHING NOT
