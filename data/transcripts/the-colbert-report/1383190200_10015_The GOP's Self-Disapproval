(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THEREPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE
YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
SIT DOWN, FOLKS.
YOU KNOW, I LIKE GIVING YOU GOODNEWS BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S SAD TO
SAY THIS CONGRESS RIGHT NOW ISTHE LEAST POPULAR OF ALL TIME.
JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOINGON ON CAPITOL HILL MAKES PEOPLE
NAUSEOUS.
NAUSEA, BY THE WAY, MORE POPULARTHAN CONGRESS.
(LAUGHTER)AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE
THE MOST-LEAST POPULAR.
(LAUGHTER)ONE REASON IS THAT THEY
DISAPPOINTED THEIR BASE BYVOTING TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING
ON THE FLIMSY EXCUSE OF AVOIDINGA GALACTIC ECONOMIC MELTDOWN.
WELL, YESTERDAY SENATEREPUBLICANS DID THEIR BEST TO
FIX THAT MISTAKE WHEN 27 G.O.P.
SENATORS VOTED TO DISAPPROVE OFTHEIR PREVIOUS VOTES TO RAISE
THE DEBT CEILING.
(LAUGHTER)I BELIEVE THE MOTION WAS TITLED
"S.R.-346, FISCAL I CALLBACKSIES."
(LAUGHTER)AND, FOLKS, IT WAS NOT EASY FOR
THEM TO GET THIS VOTE.
MITCH McCONNELL HAD TONEGOTIATE WITH HARRY REID SO
THAT THE RECENT DEBT CEILINGBILL INCLUDED A PROVISION THAT
THERE WOULD BE A SECOND VOTEEXPRESSING APPROVAL OR
DISAPPROVAL OF THE FIRST VOTE.
(LAUGHTER)IN SHORT, G.O.P. SENATORS VOTED
FOR RAISING THE DEBT CEILING ONTHE STIPULATION THEY COULD VOTE
AGAINST HAVING VOTED FOR IT.
PROVING THAT REPUBLICANS MAY NOTBE BIPARTISAN BUT THEY MAY BE
BIPOLAR.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND THESE BRAVE 27 STATESMEN LED
BY MITCH McCONNELL TOOK THISSTAND FOR THE NOBLEST OF
REASONS-- TO GET REELECTED.
I FOR ONE CANNOT WAIT FOR THECAMPAIGN ADS-- SO I DIDN'T.
JIM?
>> MITCH McCONNELL CLAIMS TOBE A SMALL-GOVERNMENT
CONSERVATIVE BUT HE VOTED WITHTHE DEMOCRATS TO RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING.
BUT MITCH McCONNELL KNOWS THATWAS WRONG.
HE TOOK A STAND AGAINST MITCHMcCONNELL.
(LAUGHTER)MITCH McCONNELL, WRONG FOR
KENTUCKY.
VOTE CHANGE.
VOTE MITCH McCONNELL.
(LAUGHTER)I'M MITCH McCONNELL AND I
APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
NO I DON'T!
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, WITH AN AD
