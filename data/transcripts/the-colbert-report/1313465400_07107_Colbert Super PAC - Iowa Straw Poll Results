THEY'RE GOING TO GET
EVERYTHING.
OF COURSE WE WERE
ADVERTISING IN IOWA BECAUSE
SATURDAY WAS THE AMES STRAW
POLL.
EVERY ONE WAS THERE EXCEPT
THE ONES WHO WEREN'T.
AND MICHELLE BACHMANN WON IT
ALL.
HER TENT WAS BY FAR THE MOST
POPULAR.
NOW SOME ANALYSTS SAY IT IS
BECAUSE OF HER STRONG
SUPPORT AMONG EVANGELICALS.
OTHERS BECAUSE OF HER STRONG
STANCE ON THE DEBT CEILING
BUT ONE INSIDER HAD A
DIFFERENT THEORY.
>> WE HAVE AN AIR
CONDITIONED TENT.
WE'VE GOT CHAIRS.
WE'VE GOT COUNTRY LEGEND
SUPERSTAR RANDY TRAVIS LIVE.
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A
PETTING SGROO FOR THE KIDS.
>> Stephen: YES, A PETTING
ZOO.
OF COURSE AT A BACHMANN
PETTING ZOO YOU ARE ONLY
ALLOWED TO PET ANIMALS OF
THE OPPOSITE SEX.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW ANOTHER FACTOR MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THAT BACHMANN
HELPED HER SUPPORTERS PAY
FOR THE $30 VOTING TICKETS
BY PAYING FOR THEM.
>> THERE WERE LONG LINES
OUTSIDE BACHMANN IT COULD
HAVE BEEN FOR THE BRISKET,
WE DON'T KNOW, THE BARBECUE.
SHE HAS A LOT OF MONEY TO
SPREAD AROUND.
SHE HAS BEEN HANDED OT
TICKETS.
>> THERE ARE REPORTS SHE
HANDED OUT 6,000 TICKETS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
SHE PAID $180,000 TO HAND
OUT $6-- 6,000 TICKETS BUT
IT WAS WORTH IT BECAUSE SHE
GOES 4,823 VOTES.
BACHMANN GOT A COMMANDING
80% OF THE VOTES SHE PAID
FOR.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I SAY, I SAY
THIS PROVES SHE COULD WIN
THE GENERAL ELECTION
ASSUMING SHE CAN GET 50
MILLION VOTERS INTO A FIELD,
PACK THEM WITH BARBECUE AND
LET THEIR CHILDREN PET RANDY
TRAVIS.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
BUT FOLKS, BUT ACCORDING TO
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
SOMEONE ELSE IS SURPRISINGLY
WELL AT THE STRAW POLL.
REPORTING QUOTE SATURDAY'S
OUTCOME SUGGESTS THAT XXX
HAS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF
SUPPORT AND PERHAPS EVEN
MORE IMPORTANT THE STRONGEST
GET OUT THE VOTE OPERATION.
YES, THEY FINISHED VERY
STRONG WITH A CERTAIN LEVEL
OF SUPPORT.
NOW THE AP IS A TOP-NOTCH
NEWS ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD
NEVER JUST PINCH OUT AN
ARTICLE BEFORE THE RESULTS
WERE IN KNOWING THEY CAN
SLAP IN ANY NAME LATER AND
THEN FORGET TO DO IT.
NO.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO.
WHEN THE AP SAYS THAT XXX
HAS THE SCIENTIFICALLY
QUANTIFIABLE CERTAIN LEVEL
OF SUPPORT, YOU CAN TAKE
THAT TO CERTAIN BANK.
(LAUGHTER)
SO I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS
MYSTERY CANDIDATE XXX.
HE SOUNDS GREAT.
UNFORTUNATELY, HE HAS A
PRETTY BIG SEX SCANDAL
WAITING TO EXPLODE BECAUSE I
GOOGLED HIS NAME ALONG WITH
THE PHRASE WAITING TO
EXPLODE AND THE RESULTS WERE
SHOCKING.
(LAUGHTER)
PRETTY SICK STUFF.
OF COURSE THE BIG LOSER IS
TIM PAWLENTY.
SADLY, PAWLENTY MADE THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT ON ABC'S THIS
WEEK WITH JAKE TAPPER.
>> I'M ANNOUNCING THIS
MORNING ON YOUR SHOW THAT
I'M GOING TO BE ENDING MY
CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT.
WHAT I BROUGHT FORWARD I
THOUGHT WAS A RATIONAL,
ESTABLISHED, CREDIBLE STRONG
RECORD OF RESULTS BUT I
THINK THE AUDIENCE SO TO
SPEAK WAS LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY WERE
NOT LOOKING FOR RATIONAL.
RATIONALITY IS THE THIRD
RAIL OF AMERICAN POLITICS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WE
EAT FRIED BUTTER ON A STICK.
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE THE ACT
OF A RATIONAL PERSON.
AND I WAS ESPECIALLY SAD TO
SEE PEEPAW GO OUT THIS WAY
CONSIDERING THE ETHIC
ETHICNESS OF HIS FIRST
COMMERCIAL.
>> THE EFFORT IT TAKES,
EXTRAORDINARY, IT TAKES
EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH.
>> Stephen: SO MUCH GRANDEUR.
SO MUCH STOCK FOOTAGE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE PLAYED THAT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE
END.
THIS IS HOW YOU WITHDRAW
FROM A CAMPAIGN.
>> ANNOUNCING THIS MORNING
THAT I'M GOING TO BE ENDING
MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT.
WE DIDN'T DO WELL IN AMES.
WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE THE
FUEL TO KEEP THE CARGOING
DOWN THE ROAD.
WE NEEDED TO GET SOME LIFT
TO CONTINUE ON AND HAVE A
PATHWAY FORWARD.
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
I WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
DIFFERENT.
BUT OBVIOUSLY THE PATHWAY
FORWARD FOR ME DOESN'T
REALLY EXIST.
WITHIN WELL, IT WAS
DISAPPOINTING.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YES, IT WAS.
WE'RE OVERCOME RIGHT NOW.
OF COURSE NOW THAT PAWLENTY
IS OUT THE BIG QUESTION IS
WHETHER BACHMANN OR PERRY
WILL GET HIS SUPPORTER.
(LAUGHTER)
9 EVEN BIGGER QUESTION IS
HOW DID COLBERT SUPERPAC DO
IN IOWA?
AS I SAID --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND I WANT TO THANK ALL
THESE PEOPLE FOR SUPPORTING
THE SUPERPAC WITHOUT HAVING
TO KNOW WHAT IT DOES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AS I SAID, OH YOU OF LITTLE
FAITH.
AS I SAID, OUR SUPERPAC RAN
SUPERADS IN DES MOINES
URGING IOWANS TO GO TO THE
STRAW POLL AND WRITE IN RICK
PERRY WITH AN A FOR IOWA.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, FOLKS, THE RESULTS ARE
IN AND RICK PERRY RECEIVED
7189 VOTES WHICH WERE ALL
SPELLED WITH AN "A"
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MENT I ASSUME BECAUSE THE
IOWA GOP OFFICIALS REFUSED
TO RELEASE THE FULL WRITE IN
RESULTS.
>> BOO!
>> Stephen: WHO ARE YOU
AFRAID OF, GOP, THAT THE
SUPERPAC NATION IS GOING TO
DEMAND THEIR SEAT AT THE
TABLE?
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS BLATANT VOTE
LAUNDERING.
YOU KNOW WHO I THINK COULD
BLOW THE LID OFF THIS THING?
THE TEAM AT WOI, DES MOINES
AES NEWS LEADER.
I'M TALKING AMANDA, RACHEL,
JOHN WALTERS ON SPORTS AND
BRAD EDWARDS AT THE WEATHER
MAP.
AND YOU KNOW WHO I THINK
COULD REALLY GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS, INTREPID
REPORTER KATIE EASTMAN.
SHE HAS PROVEN THAT SHE IS A
JOURNALISTIC BLOODHOUND.
>> THE CITY OF DES MOINES
HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS
PARK FOR A LONG TIME NOW.
AND DOG OWNERS OF DES MOINES
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT THE
PARK IS FINALLY HERE.
>> Stephen: THANKS, KATIE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS, KATIE WITH.
THAT KIND OF DOGGIE SCOOP, I
SMELL A POOLITZER.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WOI NEWS TEAM, YOU FIND OUT
HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED FOR
PERRY WITH AN "A" AND YOU
CAN BROADCAST THOSE RESULTS
ON MY SHOW.
OR I'LL BROADCAST THE SHOWS
ON YOUR SHOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIND OUT THE TRUTH.
IT'S OUT THERE.
SO IS THE FRIED
