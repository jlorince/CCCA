RAMS AND A MOUNTAIN, THE
FIGHTING OVER ME.
I'M SORRY T HAPPENS.
NATION, COUNTRIES MA IS ONLY
TWO WEEKS AWAY AND THE
FORCES OF HUMBUG REE ARE HUM
BURGERING US.
LIKE IN RHODE ISLAND WHERE
GOVERNOR LINCOLN CHAFEE IS
CHAFEEING MY ASS BY
REFERRING TO THE STATE HOUSE
EVERGREEN AS A HOLIDAY TREE.
OH COME ON, A HOLIDAY TREE?
WHAT OTHER HOLIDAYS HAVE
TREES.
ARE WE GOING TO OFFEND THE
SHINTO WINTER BON ZY
FESTIVAL?
YES, CHRISTMAS IS UNDER
ATTACK IN AMERICA AND IT'S
NOT JUST HOLIDAY TREES, IT'S
STORE GREETERS SAYING HAPPY
HOLIDAYS.
AND HOTELS NAMING THEMSELVES
HOLIDAY INN.
IT'S CHRISTMAS INN, READ THE
CONSTITUTION.
(LAUGHTER)
SO I'VE GOT TO SAY CHRISTMAS
TOO, I GUESS THIS IS THE
BLITZKRIEG ON GRINCHITUDE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JESS CUSS REALLY DO THAT
STUFF.
FOLKS, OUR FIRST GAGGLE OF
GRINCHES ARE LARGE
DEPARTMENT STORES, MACY'S,
NIEMAN MARCUS, LORD & TAYLOR
AND J.C. PENNEY HAVE STOPPED
OFFERING FREE GIFT WRAP.
ACCORDING TO NIEMAN MARCUS,
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LIKE TO
WRAP THEIR OWN PACKAGES OR
ARE HAPPY WITH A BEAUTIFUL
BOX.
OR REALLY?
YOU WANT TO SWHEE COMES IN A
BEAUTIFUL BOX?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT MAN NEEDS A GIFT
BASKET FROM CLINIQUE.
NATION, I AM A RED BLOODED
AMERICAN MALE AND THERE ARE
SOME THINGS I WILL NEVER
LEARN.
WHAT A DUVET IS.
THE NAMES OF MY NIECES AND
NEPHEWS, AND GIFT WRAPPING.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I
TRIED TO WRAP MY WIFE'S
PRESENT, OKAY.
THIS IS A PAIR OF EARRINGS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> AND IT JUST WORKS FORGET
HO, HO, HO THIS YEAR, SANTA
IS BEING TAUGHT NOW HOW TO
SAY NO, NO, NO.
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON HE IS
BALANCING THE JOB OF BEING A
GENEROUS SANTA WITH A NEW
REALITY OF HAVING TO TELL
CHILDREN TO LOWER THEIR
EXPECTATIONS IN A BAD
ECONOMY.
YOU ASKED FOR ANYTHING THAT
YOU WANT FROM SANTA BUT
UNFORTUNATELY, SANTA HAS A
BUDGET TOO.
AND WE'RE IN TIGHT TIMES.
MRS. CLAUSE AND I HAD TO SIT
DOWN AND WE LITERALLY HAD TO
CUT BACK.
IF EVERY CHILD ASKED FOR AN
iPAD, WE WOULD BE BANKRUPT.
>> Stephen: LISTEN UP,
FATMAN, THE WHOLE POINT OF
YOU BEING AT THE MALL IS TO
UPSELL THESE KIDS.
WHEN LITTLEJOHNEE ASKS YOU
FOR AN XBOX YOU REMIND HIM
HOW MUCH COOLER HE WOULD BE
WITH THE CONDUCT, A ONE-YEAR
LIVE X BOX SYSTEM AND YOU
DON'T SAY HO, HO, HO,
NOTHING CAN MATCH THE 3-D
GRAPHICS OF YOUR
IMAGINATION.
AND IF A KID ASKS YOU FOR
SOMETHING THAT IS TOO
EXPENSIVE, YOU DO THE
RESPONSIBLE THING, YOU TELL
HIM HE IS NOT BEEN GOOD
ENOUGH.
NOW THINK HOW MUCH MORE
RESPONSIBLE HE WILL BE WHEN
HE ASKS FOR THAT RED SCHWINN
SPEEDSTER ONLY TO DISCOVER
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING THAT
IT'S ANOTHER YEAR OF
SWEATERS AND TUBE SOCKS.
WON'T HE BE EXTRA MOTIVATED
TO BEHAVE BETTER NEXT YEAR?
WEEK AFTER WEEK HE'LL BE
MAILING YOU THOSE LETTERS
ASKING FOR THAT BIKE BECAUSE
THIS TIME HE IS SURE HE'S
BEEN A GOOD BOY.
HE DID HIS CHORES.
HE ATE HIS BEANS.
AND HE DIDN'T CRIES ONCE
WHEN EVERYONE AT PEEWEE
SOFTBALL CALLED HIM A SPAZ
WITH.
WHO CARES IF HE CAN'T THROW
SOME STUPID BALL FROM HOME
PLATE TO THE PITCHER'S MOUND
WITHOUT IT TAKING THREE
BOUNCES.
ONE DAY HE'S GOING TO RACE
AWAY FROM THAT GAME ON HIS
RED SCHWINN SPEEDSTER AND
SHRIEK ACROSS THE SKY LIKE A
MAGICAL SUPERCOME ED AND
THEN THEY'LL ALL SEE.
I MEAN WHAT MORE DOES HE
HAVE TO DO, SANTA?
HE JUST WANTS TO RIDE.
OTHER FATHER CHRISTMAS, OH
FATHER CHRISTMAS, IF YOU
LOVED ME AT ALL, LET ME RIDE!
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FINALLY, FOLKS, GOOD NEWS ON
THE CHRISTMAS WAR FRONT.
SOME FOLKS ARE FIGHTING BACK
FULLY ARMED, JIM?
>> WHEN YOU THINK 6 SANTA
CLAUS AND AN AK-47 ASSAULT
RIFLE DOESN'T COME TO MIND
BUT A AMMO PACKING SANTA HAS
BEEN TURNING UP AT THE
SCOTTS DALE GUN CLUB IN
ARIZONA LETTING MEMBERS POSE
WITH SANTA ALONG WITH THEIR
CHOICE OF GUNS.
>> Stephen: NOTHING SAYS
CHRISTMAS LIKE AN AK-47.
AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T, WITH
AN AK-47 YOU CAN MAKE
CHRISTMAS SAY ANYTHING YOU
WANT IT TO.
FOLKS, I AM ALL FOR THIS.
WHY SHOULDN'T OUR GUNS BE
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN
CHRISTMAS TOO?
I MEAN MY GUN'S SWEETNESS
LOVES CHRISTMAS.
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT, BABY?
SPEAK UP, WHAT'S THAT?
>> YES, I THINK THERE MIGHT
BE SOME ARMOUR PIERCING
BULLETS AND UNDER THE TREE.
NO PEEKING NOW.
IN FACT I HAVE ONLY ONE
COMPLAINT FOR THE SCOTTS
DALE GUN CLUB.
LOOK AT THEIR WEB SITE.
GET YOUR HOLIDAY PICTURE
WITH SANTA AND HIS MACHINE
GUN.
WHAT DOW MEAN HOLIDAY
PICTURE.
THEY ARE TAKING THEIR CHRIST
OUT OF JESUS CHRIST WATCH
WHERE YOU POINT THAT THING.
SO THIS YEAR, FOLKS, WHY NOT
GATHER UP THE FAMILY, COME
TO OH, LOOK, WE'RE UNDER THE
MISTLE TOE.
