THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, IF YOU KNOW ME AN IHOPE YOU DO, IF YOU WATCH
THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW I WILLDO ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO
SUPPORT OUR MILITARY SHORTOF ENLISTING.
(LAUGHTER)FRANKLY, FOLKS, I CANNOT
EVEN LOOK AT OUR SO-CALLEDCOMMANDER IN CHIEF.
JIMMY, CAN I GET A PICTUREOF HIM PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)HE IS ALWAYS WEAKENING OUR
MILITARY PREPAREDNESS ANDUNITY COHESION.
FIRST HE GETS RID OF DON'TASK DON'T TELL.
SUDDENLY AN OFFICER AND AGENTLEMAN SOUNDS LIKE DATE
NIGHT.
AND NOW, NOW THIS.
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCEIS THINKING ABOUT SPENDING
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OFYOUR DOLLARS TO BUY OUR
MARINES NEW HATS OR AS THEYCALL THEM COVERS.
AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
APPARENTLY NOT MANY WANT TOWEAR THEM.
SOME PEOPLE THINK THE NEWHAT LOOKS FAR TOO GIRLLY.
>> LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE FEMANYIZATION OF THE MARINE
CORPS.
>> Stephen: CLEARLY THE FEMANYIZATION OF MARINE CORP. I
MEAN THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THEBALLS OF MONTEZUMA.
IT'S SEMPER FI, NOT SEARCHBI.
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHOIS ENRAGED.
NEW YORKS' "THE NEW YORKPOST" SAID IT LOOKS LIKE IT
CAME FROM THE SHOPS OFCHRISTOPHER STREET.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, THEN SI HAVE TO ASSUME
THE NEW HAT IS A NEON MESHAND SECURED WITH A BALL GAG.
ALL RIGHT, JIM, LET'S SEETHIS NEW GIRLIE HAT-AS
TROPHY NEXT TO THE CURRENTDENY.
OH, O MY GOD, LOOK AT THAT IJUST CANNOT TELL WHICH ONE
IS THE NEW ONE.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH ONE-- OH, IT'S THE ONE
ON THE RIGHT, THE ONE ON THERIGHT, YEAH, HATE THOSE.
IT'S SO FEMININE, I'M JUSTOVULATING LOOKING AT THEM.
(LAUGHTER)THIS HAT MIGHT AS WELL BE
MADE OF TAMPONS AND COPIESOF EAT, PRAY, LOVE.
I MEAN THOSE TWO INCHES OFEXTRA BRIM IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MARINE AND MAUREEN.
NOW SURE, THE DEPARTMENT OFDEFENCE SAYS THE PROPOSED
HAT IS BASED ON THE ONE WORNBY WORLD WAR I HERO AND TWO
TIME MEDAL OF HONOR WINNERSERGEANT MAJOR DAN DALEY.
WHAT DOES THAT GUY KNOWABOUT BEING MANLY.
HE'S WEARING TWO NECKLACESAND A BROACH.
ALL THAT IS MISSING IS THEMATCHING EARRINGS.
MARK MY WORDS, FOLKS.
NEXT OBAMA WILL HAVE THEARMY RANGERS IN BARRATTS AND
DRESS THE NAVY UP IN LITTLESAILOR SUITS.
WE'RE NOT SELLING CRACKERJACKS HERE.
OH, AND YOU CAN FORGETWEARING CAMEO, SOON OUR
SOLDIERS WILL ALL BE WEARINGGEORGIA O'KEEFFE PAINTINGS.
(LAUGHTER)AND THAT REMINDED ME OF
SOMETHING.
THAT REMINDED ME OFSOMETHING.
I DON'T-- IF ANYTHING, FOLKS,IF ANYTHING, OUR MILITARY
HATS SHOULD BE MORE MANLY.
I SAY WE MAKE THEM OUT OFBEEF JERKY AND SHARK'S
