YOU WIN.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
IN HERE, OUT THERE, NATION,
ELECTION DAY IS ALMOST HERE, AND
CAMPAIGNS ARE GETTING DIRTY AS
THE DEMOCRATS GET DESPERATE.
THE LATEST VICTIM IS OHIO G.O.P.
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE RICH
IOTT.
JIM.
>> REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND TEA
PARTY DARLING RICH IOTT WORE A
NAZI UNIFORM IN WORLD WAR II
RE-ENACTMENTS.
IOTT SAYS HE'S JUST FASCINATED,
THOUGH, BY HISTORY, AND DID IT
TO BOND WITH HIS YOUNG SON.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
FATHERS BOND WITH THEIR SONS IN
ALL KINDS OF WAYS.
BUILDING A BOAT, FIXING THE CAR,
SOLVING THE JEWISH PROBLEM.
( LAUGHTER )
AND YOU CAN'T FAULT A GUY FOR
BEING PASSIONATE ABOUT HISTORY.
IOTT EXPLAINED, "I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN FASCINATED BY THE FACT THAT
THERE WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL
COUNTRY THAT, FROM A STRICTLY
MILITARY POINT OF VIEW,
ACCOMPLISHED INCREDIBLE THINGS.
SEE.
HE'S JUST FASCINATED BY NAZIS
BECAUSE THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, I DON'T EXPECT THE LIBERAL
ELITES OUT THERE TO UNDERSTAND
HOW FUN IT IS TO SPEND FAMILY
TIME ANNEXING THE SUDATINLAND,
SO NO SURPRISE THAT THIS PAST
SUNDAY DEMOCRAT DEBBIE
WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ CRITICIZED HIS
LOVE OFFER JACK-BOOTS, BUT I WAS
DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE GOP'S ERIC
CANTOR WALKED AWAY FROM A FELLOW
REPUBLICAN.
>> DEBBIE LAUNCHED INTO HER
ATTACKS ABOUT SOME CANDIDATES
THAT ARE RUN, PARTICULARLY THE
ONE IN OHIO HAVING TO DO WITH A
NAZI RE-ENACTMENT, SHE KNOWS
THEY WOULD ABSOLUTELY REPUDIATE
THAT AND NOT SUPPORT...
>> WELL, YOU HAVEN'T.
>> I'M DOING IT RIGHT HERE.
I'M DOING IT RIGHT HERE, DEBBIE.
YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL THAT I
DON'T SUPPORT ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
>> Stephen: THANKS, ERIC
CANTOR, WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT,
NOW IOTT WILL LOSE THE JEWISH
VOTE.
( LAUGHTER )
PLUS THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THE
REPUBLICANS LOOK DIVIDED.
UP UNTIL NOW TEA PARTY
CANDIDATES COULD DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT REBUKE FROM PARTY
LEADERS.
I MEAN NEW YORK ONE CONDEMNED
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL FOR HAVING
BEEN A WITCH.
NO ONE SLAMMED CONNECTICUT
SENATE CANDIDATE LINDA McMAHON
FOR DOING THIS.
AND I DID NOT SEE ERIC CANTOR
CONDEMNING NEW YORK
GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE CARL
PALADINO WHEN HE EXPRESSED THIS
CONCERN FOR OUR CHILDREN.
>> I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE
BRAINWASHED INTO THINKING
HOMOSEXUALITY IS AN EQUALLY
VALID AND ACCEPTABLE OPTION.
IT ISN'T.
>> Stephen: OR WHEN PALADINO
MASS E-MAILED A BEASTALTY VIDEO.
OF COURSE, THE BEASTALTY VIDEO
WASN'T BAD FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE
IT WAS A WOMAN AND A MALE HORSE.
( LAUGHTER )
NOTHING GAY.
SO TO RECAP, FOR THE REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP, THE LINE YOU CAN'T
CROSS, AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE
IN LIFE, IS DRESSING LIKE A
NAZI.
THANKFULLY DRESSING THE
PRESIDENT AS A
