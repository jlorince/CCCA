>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, WE NOW TURN TO OURCONTINUING SPORT REPORT COVERAGE
ALREADY IN PROGRESS.
AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN ALIFELONG FOOTBALL FAN FOR
ALMOST TWO WEEKS NOW.
AND LIKE ALL HARD-CORE FOOTNUTS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO MAY'S NFL DRAFT UNTIL ISAW THIS.
>> AN ALL AMERICAN FOOTBALLSTAR REVEALED HE IS GAY.
>> MISSOURI MICHAEL SAM CAMEOUT OF THE CLOSET.
>> MICHAEL SAM TO BE DRAFTEDTO THE NFL WOULD MAKE HIM
THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYERIN THAT LEAGUE.
>> I CAME TO TELL THE WORLDI'M AN OPENLY PROUD GAY MAN.
>> OK THAT TOOK COURAGE BUTWE CAN'T HAVE A GAY FOOTBALL
PLAYER! IT IS FIRST ANDTEN, NOT FIRST IN STEVE.
AND THE MOST OFFENSIVE PART,MICHAEL SAM DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MIGHTBE OFFENDED.
>> THIS IS TO ME JUSTTELLING ANOTHER
PERSON, HEY, I'M GAY AND ITSHOULDN'T A BIG PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY, SIR,BUT NOBODY CHOOSES TO HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH THIS.
I WAS BORN HAVING A PROBLEMWITH THIS.
LOOK.
LOOK, COME ON, NOBODY ISSAYING THIS GUY IS NOT A
GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER.
ALL-AMERICAN, THE SEC'SDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR
THAT IS QUITE ANHONOR COMING FROM THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION.
BUT NOW-- PRO TEAMS ARE JUSTGOING TO HAVE TO THINK TWICE
BEFORE DRAFTING HIM.
>> "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"SPOKE WITH NEARLY A DOZEN
COACHES AND NFL EXECUTIVES,MANY OF WHOM SAID FOOTBALL
ISN'T READY FOR AN OPENLYGAY PLAYER.
>> YESTERDAY MICHAEL SAM WASPROJECTED AS THE THIRD OR
FOURTH ROUND PICK, BUTDEFINITELY ON THE BOARD.
AND TODAY EXECUTIVES WILLSAY ANONYMOUSLY THAT HIS
STOCK HAS DROPPED.
HE MAY NOT EVEN BE DRAFTED.
>> I THINK A NUMBER OF TEAMSWILL PROBABLY NOT WANT TO
DEAL WITH HIM AT ALL BECAUSETHEY DON'T WANT THE
SO-CALLED DISTRACTION THATGOES ALONG WITH IT.
>> THE THING YOU TALK ABOUTIN THE ORGANIZATION WITH THE
GM AND OBVIOUSLY THE OWNER,IS CAN WE HANDLE THIS GUY.
CAN THE PLAYERS HANDLE THEMEDIA ATTENTION THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO GET.
WHEN THEY GET THE QUESTIONASKED ARE YOU OKAY WITH A
GAY TEAMMATE.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
I MEAN JUST THINK OF THATQUESTION.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH A GAYTEAMMATE.
WHO WANTS TO PUT THEIRPLAYERS THROUGH THE AGONY OF
SAYING -->> YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: I MEAN I
JUST-- CAN'T-- I CANNOTBELIEVE WE HAVE COME TO THIS
AS A NATION, TO SULLY GAMEOF BEN ROETHLISBERGER AND
MICHAEL VICK WITH A GAY GUY.
SO FOLKS, ALL OF THATJUSTIFIES NOT DRAFTING THE
TOP DEFENSIVE PLAYER IN THESEC.
>> AND MICHAEL SAM'S ONLYCHANCE IS TO GO BACK IN THE
CLOSET, MIKE, WE'LL PRETENDYOU'RE NOT GAY AS LONG AS
YOU PRETEND WE'RE NOTBIGOTS.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL ALSO BE RIGHT BACK.
