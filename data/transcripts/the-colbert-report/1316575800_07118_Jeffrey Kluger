>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A
BOOK ABOUT THE BONDS BETWEEN
SIBLINGS.
IF I DON'T LIKE HIS ANSWERS, I'M
TELLING MOM.
PLEASE WELCOME JEFFREY KLUGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, MR. KLUGER, THANKS SO
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU
ARE A SENIOR WRITER FOR "TIME"
MAGAZINE, YOU ARE ALSO THE
AUTHOR OF "LOST MOON" WHICH IS
WHAT THE APOLO 13 MOVIE WAS
BASED ON AND YOU HAVE A BOOK
CALLED "THE SIBLING EFFECT, WHAT
THE BONDS AMONG BROTHERS AND
SISTERS REVEAL ABOUT US."
OKAY.
WHAT CAN YOU... WE NEVER MET
BEFORE.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU KNOW
ABOUT ME BASED ON MY BIRTH ORDER
IN A FAMILY OF 11?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IN A
FAMILY OF 11 THERE WAS A
FEROCIOUS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL IN
YOUR NEST.
>> Stephen: THERE WAS.
>> EVERY CHILD IN THE FAMILY IS
COMPETING FOR MOM'S AND DAD'S
ATTENTION, LOVE, RESOURCES.
AND THINK OF THAT, IF MOM HAS 11
CHICKS IN THE NEST AND ONLY TEN
WORMS, SOMEONE'S GOING HUNGRY.
NOW, THE YOUNGEST IS THE ONE
WHO'S THE LIKELY TOAST GO HUNGRY
SO WHAT THE YOUNGEST DOES IS
DEVELOP A SENSE OF CHARISMA, A
SENSE OF CHARM, AN ABILITY TO
DISARM AND AMUSE AND THAT WAY
IT'S A LOW-POWER STRATEGY, IT'S
CALLED.
YOU'RE THE LITTLEST ONE AND YOU
FIND WAYS INTO THE MINDS AND
HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A VERY GOOD
BOOK.
IS
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
VERY GOOD BOOK.
SO LET'S GET BACK TO HOW
CHARMING I AM.
SO I USE MY CHARM HOW?
WHAT DID I DO?
YOU SAID LOW POWER
>> YOU'RE THE SMALLEST AMERICAN
THE ROOM SO YOUNGEST CHILDREN
ARE ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF
PUT INTOING WHAT'S GOING ON IN
SOMEBODY ELSE'S MIND.
IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO INTUIT
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BIG
BROTHER'S MIND, YOU ARE ABOUT TO
GET SLUGGED.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
SLULGING BECAUSE IN THE BIG
FAMILY THERE'S A CASCADE EFFECT
IN WHO GETS BEATEN UP.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YES.
>> Stephen: AND YOU SAY THAT WE
ACTUALLY... WE MIGHT LEARN MORE
SOCIAL SKILLS FROM OUR BROTHERS
AND SISTERS THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN
OUR LIVES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE
WITH YOU THE ENTIRE RIDE FROM
THE BEGINNING TO THE END.
YOUR PARENTS LEAVE YOU TOO EARLY
YOUR WIFE AND KIDS COME ALONG
TOO LATE.
YOUR SIBLINGS ARE THE DRESS
REHEARSAL FOR YOUR LIFE.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE KITTENS
WRESTLING.
TWO KITTENS WRESTLE, THEY BITE
EACH OTHER'S NECKS, NOBODY'S
TRYING TO KILL EACH ANYBODY.
BUT WHAT YOU LEARN BITING A NECK
WILL BE USED KILLING A MOUSE.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT SOCIAL
SKILLS WAS I LEARNING WHEN MY
BROTHER PINNED MY SHOULDERS DOWN
WITH HIS KNEES AND THEN PRETENDS
TO SPIT ON MY FOREHEAD BUT THEN
SUCKED IT BACK AT THE LAST
MINUTE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT WAS THE SKILL?
WHAT WAS THE TERROR AND THE
DISGUST DOING FOR ME AT THAT
MOMENT?
>> I'M NOT SURE SCIENCE HAS
OPENED THAT DOOR.
BUT WHAT IT WAS DOING, THOUGH,
WAS TEACHING YOU HOW...
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: TRUE STORY.
TRUE STORY.
>> IT WAS TEACHING YOU HOW TO
SURRENDER.
IT WAS ALSO TEACHING YOU....
>> Stephen: REALLY?
(LAUGHS)
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO GO
RUBBER AT A CERTAIN POINT.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.
AND A.
>> Stephen: AND IF A LOT OF YOUR
BROTHERS WERE ALL-STATE
WRESTLERS AND THEY USED YOU AS A
WRESTLING DUMMY TO PRACTICE
ILLEGAL CHOKE HOLDS ON?
>> YOU LEARN WEEPING.
>> Stephen: HOW TO SHARE MY
EMOTIONS WITH SHAME.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT OTHER IMPORTANT BIRTH
ORDERS... LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
OLDEST.
WHAT DOES THE OLDEST GOT THAT
THE YOUNGEST AIN'T?
>> THE OLDEST HAS... IT'S SORT
OF LIKE CORPORATIONS, FAMILIES.
FAMILIES INVEST MORE IN THEIR
OWN ED CHILD.
THEY HAVE TWO OR THREE YEARS
BEFORE THE NEXT ONES COME ALONG.
SO THINK ABOUT HOW CORPORATIONS
OPERATE.
IT'S CALLED SUM COST.
THE FURTHER ALONG A PROJECT IS,
THE LIKELIER THEY ARE TO SUPPORT
THAT AS OPPOSED TO A YOUNGER
PROJECT.
OR A LESS DEVELOPED PRODUCT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE OLDEST ONE WILL GENERALLY
BE THE ONE MOST DEEPLY
EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN.
>> Stephen: AND THE OTHER KIDS
ARE WHAT?
SPARES?
(LAUGHTER)
>> SORT OF REPLACEMENT PARTS.
>> Stephen: REPLACEMENT PARTS.
ARE THERE FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF,
LIKE, OLDEST CHILDREN/YOUNGEST
CHILDREN?
>> WHO THRIVE....
>> Stephen: LIKE WHO ARE
EXAMPLES OF YOUNGER BEHAVIOR OR
EDER?
>> SURE, IF YOU LOOK AT JOE
KENNEDY AND TEDDY KENNEDY.
TEDDY HAD CERTAIN BEHAVIORAL
ISSUES AS HE WAS GROWING UP.
NOW HE BECAME THE PATTER A MILL
I CAN'T SAY, HE BECAME THE
AUTHORITATIVE ONE IN HIS FAMILY
AND THIS IS CALLED THE
FUNCTIONAL FIRST BORN.
MY OLDER BROTHER WENT TO PREP
SCHOOL SO I BECAME THE
FUNCTIONAL FIRST BORN IN MY
FAMILY.
SO YOU STEP IN WHEN THE OLDEST
ONE ISN'T ABLE TO EXECUTE THE
DUTIES OF OFFICE.
>> Stephen: DOES SEX MATTER?
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MY SISTERS
ARE BOSSY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND MY SISTER MARY IS NOT THE
OLDEST BUT SHE IS THE BOSS OF
THE FAMILY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: WE ALL LOVE HER AND
ARE AFRAID OF HER.
(LAUGHTER)
AND DO GIRLS DO THAT MORE OFTEN?
>> GIRLS DO THAT MORE OFTEN IN
THE DOMESTIC SETTING.
IT'S WHAT'S CALLED FAMILY
DOMAINS, WHAT HAPPENS ON THE
SOCCER FIELD AND MAYBE YOUR BIG
BROTHER WOULD THRIVE THERE.
THERE'S WHAT HAPPENS AT HOME AND
YOUR BIG SISTER WILL BE THE
AUTHORITY.
ALSO GIRLS SERVE AS CIVILIZING
FORCES FOR BOYS.
IT IS TRUE WHAT COLLEGE GIRLS
SAY THAT THEY CAN TELL A BOY WHO
GREW UP WITH SISTERS AND COLLEGE
BOY CANS SAY THEY CAN TELL A
GIRL WHO GREW UP WITH BROTHERS
BECAUSE THEY KNOW A LITTLE BIT
HOW THE TURN THE TUMBLERS OF THE
OPPOSITE SEX AND GET INSIDE
THEIR MIND.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID THAT
YOUNGEST CHILDREN ARE SORT OF
INTUITIVE AND CHARMING AND
CHARISMATIC AND OLDER SIBLINGS
FEEL CONFIDENT AND INVESTED IN
AND HAVE THEIR OWN DYNAMISM.
WHERE DO YOU FALL?
>> I AM A MIDDLE CHILD SO
THERE'S A CINDERELLA QUALITY TO
THAT.
>> Stephen: DO YOUR OLDEST OR
YOUNGER BROTHERS HAVE A BOOK?
I'D LOVE TO READ ONE OF THOSE.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY SOUND FASCINATING.
>> SADLY, THEY DO HAVE VERY GOOD
BOOKS.
>> Stephen: PLEASE GET ME THEIR
NAMES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
JEFFREY KLUGER, THE BOOK IS "THE
SIBLING EFFECT."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
