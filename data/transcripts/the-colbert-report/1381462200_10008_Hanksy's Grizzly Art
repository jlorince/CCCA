( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, IF YOU ARE A LOYALVIEWER OF THE THE "COLBERT
REPORT," YOU KNOW I CALLED OUT ASTREET ARTIST.
THIS VANDAL IS SPENDING OCTOBERTURNING WALLS IN NEW YORK CITY
INTO PRICELESS WORKS OF ART.
I DO NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE THISTEMPORARY ARTFUL DODGER BECAUSE
HIS GLORIFICATION OF GRAFFITICOULD LEAD OUR KIDS DOWN THE
WRONG PATH, TO A LIFE OF CRIME--OR WOARTS, OUR SCOOZ.
THIS PAST MOND I SPECIFICALLYFORBADE HIM FROM PAINTING ON THE
WALL OF MY STUDIO, AND,THEREFORE, TRANSFORMING IT INTO
A MILLION-DOLLAR WORK OF ART.
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE THIS MORNINGWHEN I DISCOVERED THIS
INCREDIBLE WORK OF ART ON MYSTUDIO WALL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHO ISMORE IMPRESSIVE-- HOW HE
CAPTURED MY LIKENESS OR HOW HEKNEW WHAT I LOOK LIKE BEFORE I
BODY WAX.
NOW, AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WASBANKSY.
BUT IT TURNS OUT THE WORK WASSIGNED BY HANKSY, WHO EVIDENTLY
IS A WELL-KNOWN STREET ARTISTWHOSE WORK USES CELEBRITY
ICONOGRAPHY TO ADDRESS THEEFESMERAL NATURE OF FAME
PARTICULARLY WITH TERRIBLEPUNS.
HIS OTHER WORKS INCLUDE HEMUELL.PD JACKSON, AND METH ROGAN.
POWERFUL STUFF.
REALLY MAKES YOU NOT THINK.
HERE I ASSUME I AM STEPHENCOL-GRIZZRY OFLY.
BUT LIKE BANKSY, HAIRCHGZY'SIDENTITY IS A MYSTERY.
WHO CULD HE?
HANKSY'S FIRST STREET ARTFEATURED TOM HANKS WHO HAPPENED
TO BE MY GUEST LAST NIGHT, ANDTHAT'S WHEN THE LIGHT BULB WENT
OFF.
HANKSEE, SOUNDS LIKE YANGTZE.
THERE ARE THREE GORGEOUS MEMBERSOF ONE DIRECTION, THE OTHER TWO
ARE... ONE DIRECTION IS ANOTHERWAY OF SAYING ONE WAY AND MY
CONSTITUTE STOOUDIO IS ON AONE-WAY STREET WHERE HANKSY PUT
HIS ART.
IT'S ALL A CRYPTIC CODE LIKE THEDA VINCI CODE STARRING TOM
HANKS.
TOM HAIRCHGZ MUST BE HANKSY.
AND I GOTTA SAY.
YOU SEE, YOU SEE.
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.
I GOTTA SAY I'M A LITTLE UPSETTHAT HE USED THE SPRAY PAINT I
LEFT IN HIS DRESSING ROOM.
I TOLD YOU, TOM, THAT SPRAYPAINT WAS FOR HUFFING ONLY.
PAIL GIAMATTI UNDERSTOOD THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I'M SORRY, BANKSY, BUT IT IS TOOLATE FOR YOU TO PUT ONE OF YOUR
HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER MASTERPIECESON MY WALL BECAUSE THERE'S STILL
ONLY LOTS OF ROOM LEFT.
BY THE WAY, NEXT WEEK WE'RE ONVACATION, SO I WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHEN YOU DID IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
