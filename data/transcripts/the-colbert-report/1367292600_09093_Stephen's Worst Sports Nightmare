( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
MAY I OFFER A HEARTY SHALOM TO
CERTAIN MEMBERS OF MY AUDIENCE
TONIGHT.
NATION, THE DAY I HAVE LONG
WARNED YOU ABOUT HAS FINALLY
ARRIVED.
NOT THE ONE WHERE MY DEATH RAY
IS COMPLETED.
THAT IS STILL SIX MONTHS OUT.
AND YOU ARE WARNED.
NO, IT IS A DIFFERENT DAY, AND I
WARNED YOU ABOUT IT.
>> JASON COLLINS HAS BECOME THE
FIRST OPENLY GAY ATHLETE IN PRO
SPORTS.
COLLINS IS WITH THE WASHINGTON
WIZARDS.
>> COLLINS IS THE FIRST ACTIVE
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE IN ANY OF
THE FOUR MAJOR SPORTS TO MAKE
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WHILE STILL A
PLAYER.
>> COLLINS SAYS, "I'M A
34-YEAR-OLD NBA CENTER.
I'M BLACK.
AND I'M GAY."
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE CAME OUT AS BLACK AND GAY.
EVEN MORE SHOCKING HE CAME OUT
AS A PLAYER FOR THE WASHINGTON
WIZARDS.
YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER HOW HIS
PARENTS TOOK IT.
FOLKS, THIS IS MY WORST SPORTS
NIGHTMARE.
I KNEW ONCE WE ALLOWED MAJOR
LEAGUE SOCCER, IT WOULD TURN ALL
THE OTHER SPORTS GAY.
NOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A
PRO ATHLETE COULD BE GAY, HOW
CAN I RELATE TO THEM?
SUDDENLY IT'S LIKES A SEVEN FOOT
TALL WORLD CLASS ATHLETE AND I
HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.
NOW WHEN I HOOP IT UP WITH MY
BASKET-BROS, I CAN'T USE
EXPRESSIONS LIKE "TAKE IT TO THE
HOLE" OR "JAMMING THE RIM" OR
"HEY, LET'S TOUCH EACH OTHER'S
PENISES."
WHICH OF COURSE IS JUST STREET
SLANG TORE SETTING A PICK.
THE POINT IS GAY SPORTS DO NOT
MAKE ANY SENSE.
JUST LIKE GAY MARRIAGE DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE MARRIAGE
IS FOR MAKING BABIES AND SO IS
BASKETBALL.
JUST ASK THE THOUSANDS OF WILT
CHAMBERLAIN'S CHILDREN.
I MEAN THE WHOLE GAME IS A
METAPHOR FOR PROCEED CREATION.
THE BALL IS THE SPERM, THE HOOP
IS THE EGG AND THE SHOT CLOCK IS
THE OVULATION CYCLE.
FELLOWS, THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO
GET OFF YOUR SHOT IN THE FIRST
24 SECONDS.
I JUST HOPE HOMOSEXUALS DON'T
GET THEIR HANDS ON ANY OF MY
OTHER FAVORITE SPORTS
