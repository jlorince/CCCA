>> Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE EDITOR OF "VOGUE" AND IS
HERE TO TELL US WHETHER FASHION IS HIGH ART.
I BELIEVE IT IS VERY EMOTIONAL,
VERY MOVING WHAT WITH THE MESSAGE THAT IS THERE ON THE DRESS.
PLEASE WELCOME ANNA WINTOUR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
ALL RIGHT, TOUGH GUY.
(LAUGHTER) I'VE GOT A BONE TO PICK YOU W YOU?
YOU READY?
>> OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT THIS...
BESIDES EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF "VOGUE," OKAY.
THAT'S WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT YOU.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE LIKE WITH ONE HESITATION YOU CAN DESTROY SOMEONE'S CAREER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS DRESS?
WELL I... HMM.
DEAD!
>> DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE A FEW MORE RISKS WITH THE WAY YOU'RE DRESSING?
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY SUIT ISN'T BUTTONED AND I WENT WITH A FOREIGN HAND NOT.
THAT'S CRAZY, I SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A HALF WINDSOR.
>> NOW THAT YOU'RE ENDORSING GAY MARRIAGE, TAD WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR LOOK.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) EXCUSE ME!
EXCUSE ME, MADAM!
TAD WANTED US TO WEAR LINEN CALF TANS AND DO IT BAREFOOT ON A BEACH, SO YOU DON'T WANT HIS
FASHION ADVICE.
>> I'M ALL FOR THAT.
>> I'M NOT ENDORSING GAY MARRIAGE, I'M RESISTING GAY MARRIAGE.
YOU HERE IN THE FASHION WORLD,
STOCK?
ARE THERE GAY PEOPLE IN THE FASHION WORLD?
(LAUGHTER) ARE YOU AS ANGRY AS I AM ABOUT THIS GAY MARRIAGE THING?
>> I AM THRILLED.
THERE WERE TEARS IN THE OFFICE OF "VOGUE" TODAY IN THE SUPPORT OF GAY MARRIAGE.
WE'RE THRILLED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU'RE REINFORCING THE HATEFUL STEREOTYPE.
>> I THINK IT'S A LONG OVERDUE ENDORSEMENT AND WE'RE HONORED
HE'S COME FORWARD FINALLY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THE THING THAT I WANT TO REALLY PICK THE BONE WITH YOU ON IS
YOU'VE GOT THIS... YOU'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE EXHIBITION AT
THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,
THEIR COSTUME INSTITUTE.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: THERE'S A SHOW GOING ON CALLED SCALP REALLY AND
PRADA, IMPOSSIBLE CONVERSATIONS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO SCAPARELLI WAS.
>> SHE WORKED IN PARIS AT THE SAME TIME AS CHANEL.
SHE WORKED WITH DAHL I AND COCTEAU AND WAS VERY INDEPENDENT AND A FEMINIST BEFORE HER TIME.
I THINK SHE HAD A RATHER SAD LIFE BECAUSE WHEN SHE WAS A KID SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS SO UGLY SHE
PLANTED SEEDS ON HER FACE SO BEAUTY WOULD GROW.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) AND SHE HAD A RATHER...
>> Couric: WOW.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S HEARTBREAKING.
BUT BEAUTIFUL AT THE SAME TIME.
DON'T SUCK ME INTO YOUR GAY WORLD!
DON'T YOU DO IT!
DON'T MAKE ME HAVE FEELINGS FOR FASHION, YOUNG LADY.
BUT THE ARGUMENT OF THIS SHOW IS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER FASHION CAN BE ART.
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE?
>> I BELIEVE BOTH.
I BELIEVE FASHION CAN BE JUST SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR LIKE YOURSELF.
OR SOMETHING THAT...
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YOU MEAN SOMETHING THAT I ROCK!
>> AND SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TRULY CREATIVE AND CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK AT CULTURE AND FASHION.
>> Stephen: CLOTHES ARE COMMERCE.
THAT'S ALL THEY ARE.
>> I THINK CLOTHES ALSO REFLECT THE CULTURE AND THE TIME.
IF YOU LOOK AT A GREAT FASHION PICTURE, SAY, OF THE '60s IT TELLS YOU JUST AS MUCH AS WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD AS THE HEADLINE OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
FASHION IS SELF-EXPRESSION.
FASHION IS REALLY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A
GREAT DESIGNER LIKE PRADA, SHE'S GOING FAR DEEPER THAN JUST SIMPLY THINGS YOU PUT ON YOUR BACK.
SHE'S EXAMINING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD THROUGH ART,
THROUGH FILM, THROUGH MUSIC AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT THIS EXHIBITION IS REALLY TRYING TO
TALK ABOUT.
>> Stephen: WELL, I DON'T REALLY TRUST PRADA.
(LAUGHTER) MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION,
MADAM!
THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION.
I'LL TELL YOUING?
THAT BUGS ME.
>> Stephen: THAT MOVIE WAS SO LAST YEAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE'VE GONE WAY BEYOND THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT I DON'T GET IS YOU HAVE TWO ITALIANS HERE.
THIS IS AN AMERICAN MUSEUM.
WHY NOT HAVE ONE OF THE BROOKS BROTHERS TALKING TO ABERCROMBIE OR FITCH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THIS IS... BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE FROM BUT ABOUT AN AESTHETIC AND
IT'S A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEIR BELIEFS, THEIR SIMILARITIES, AND THEIR
DIFFERENCES AND WE WERE SO LUCKY TO HAVE THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN DIRECTOR BECAUSE LURE MAN FILM A
SHORT FILM THAT OPENS THE EXHIBITION WHICH SHOWS THE REAL PRADA TALKING TO JUDY DAVIS, THE
GREAT AUSTRALIAN ACTRESS PLAYING SCAPARELLI.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF THAT.
>> THAT'S VERY SMART OF YOU.
>> IF WE LIVE TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME WOULD WE BE FRIENDS OR FOES?
>> I THINK FRIENDS.
>> SO MAYBE NOW WE CAN AGREE THAT DESIGNERS ARE ARTISTS?
>> NO, NEVER!
I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB AND WHO CARES ABOUT THE TITLE.
SAL LEWD.
(APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: IS THERE EVER A TIME WHEN YOU CAN NOT CARE ABOUT FASHION?
DO YOU EVER JUST SAY TO YOURSELF TO HELL WITH THIS, PUT ON YOUR ZEBRA STRIPED SWEAT PANTS AND GO
TO LONG JOHN SILVERS AND JUST LOSE YOURSELF IN A PILE OF BATTER-FRIED SHRIMP?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T DONE IT RECENTLY BUT MAYBE NOW YOU SUGGESTED I SHOULD TRY.
>> Stephen: PERHAPS YOU AND I...
>> TOGETHER!
>> Stephen: COULD GO BOBBING FOR FRENCH FRIES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHY NOT?
IT'S A DATE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MS. WINTOUR.
