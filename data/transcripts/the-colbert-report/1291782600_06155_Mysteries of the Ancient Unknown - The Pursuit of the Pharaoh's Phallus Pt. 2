OBVIOUSLY.
NATION, LAST NIGHT I SHOWED YOU
PART ONE IN THE LATEST IN MY
AWARD-RESISTANT SERIES "STEPHEN
COLBERT'S MYSTERIES OF THE
ANCIENT UNKNOWN: KING TUT'S
PENIS."
OUR JOURNEY CONTINUES.
JIM.
PREVIOUSLY ON "MYSTERIES OF THE
ANCIENT UNKNOWN," I TRAVELED TO
THE KING TUT EXHIBIT IN TIMES
SQUARE FOR AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW WITH EGYPTOLOGIST
DR. DAVID SILVERMAN.
1922, TUT IS DISCOVERED IN HIS
TOMB.
PENIS IS INTACT.
>> CORRECT.
>> STEPHEN: 1968.
BOOM.
NOTICE ANYTHING MISSING?
LET'S STOP BEATING AROUND THE
BUSH.
WHERE'S THE PENIS?
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING AT.
>> STEPHEN: SO TONIGHT WE
SEARCHED FOR CLUES AMONG KING
TUT'S TREASURE IN THE DRAMATIC
CONCLUSION OF "MYSTERIES OF THE
ANCIENT UNKNOWN: STEPHEN COLBERT
AND THE PURSUIT OF THE PHARAOH'S
FALLIS."
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ITEM.
>> WE CALL IT A KARTOUCHE BOX.
>> WERE KARTOUCHES ALWAYS BOXES?
WERE THERE EVER KARTOUCHE BAGS?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: HOW MUCH OF YOUR
LIFE'S WORK IS MADE UP?
>> I DON'T THINK ANY OF IT IS.
>> STEPHEN: I COULD SAY THAT
MEANS SOMETHING ELSE.
TO ME I SEE LET'S PLAY CHECKERS
ON THE OCEAN WITH THE ARTIST
FORMERLY KNOWN AS PRINCE.
>> THE PICTURE AT THE VERY TOP
IN RED AND BLACK IS ACTUALLY A
GAME BOARD.
>> STEPHEN: SO I'M RIGHT.
>> WELL, NOT ACTUALLY.
>> STEPHEN: BUT IT IS A BOARD.
>> IT IS A BOARD.
>> STEPHEN: I SAID IT WAS.
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: THEREFORE I AM
RIGHT.
>> IN THAT PART, YES.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
I LIKE THIS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT COULD BE
INSIDE, DOCTOR?
>> WHEN WE TAKE THE EXHIBITION
DOWN, I'LL LOOK INSIDE, AND IF
THERE IS A PENIS, I'LL GIVE YOU
A CALL.
>> STEPHEN: WHOSE PENIS?
>> WELL, I THINK YOU'RE ONLY
INTERESTED IN KING TUT'S.
>> STEPHEN: IF I WERE PLAYING
HIDE THE ANCIENT SALAMI, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE I WOULD HAVE
STASHED IT.
>> THAT'S AN IVORY BOX, AND IN
THE BACK IT HAS HINGES.
AND THOSE MAY BE AMONG THE FIRST
METAL HINGES MADE, AND THEY
STILL WORK.
>> STEPHEN: AND THAT'S NOT ON
THE BANNER OUT FRONT?
WHY NOT "HINGES WITH KING TUT"?
YOU TELL PEOPLE THERE ARE HINGES
IN HERE, YOU GET A LINE DOWN THE
STREET.
HINGES.
WOW.
WOW.
THOSE LOOK A LOT LIKE HINGES.
DID YOU KNOW THIS WHEN YOU GOT
INTO EGYPTOLOGY THAT THERE WAS
TO BE THIS MUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT
HINGES?
>> I DID NOT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU DID NOT.
THAT'S JUST GRAVY FOR YOU.
>> THAT'S WHY I LIKE EXHIBITS.
>> STEPHEN: THEY DO NOT MAKE
THEM LIKE THEY USED TO.
WELL, ACTUALLY, THEY MAKE THEM
EXACTLY LIKE THEY USED TO.
AS FASCINATING AS HINGES ARE, IT
WAS TIME FOR ME TO TAKE A LOOK
AT TUT HIMSELF.
SO HERE WE ARE, FINALLY FACE TO
FACE WITH KING TUT'S MUMMY.
>> WELL, THIS IS ACTUALLY A
REPLICA OF KING TUT'S MUMMY
HERE.
>> STEPHEN: I KNOW THAT.
I KNOW THAT.
FINALLY FACE TO FACE WITH A
REPLICA OF KING TUT'S MUMMY.
( LAUGHTER )
COULD THE PERSON WHO STOLE KING
TUT'S PENIS HAVE ALSO STOLEN THE
REPLICA'S PENIS?
>> ACTUALLY, WE DON'T THINK THE
PENIS WAS STOLEN.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S NOT THERE.
>> YOU'RE CORRECT.
THERE ISN'T A PENIS THERE.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
SOMETHING ABOUT SILVERMAN'S
EXCUSES WEREN'T ADDING UP.
IT WAS TIME TO TURN UP THE HEAT.
DR. SILVERMAN, I DON'T WANT TO
PUSSYFOOT AROUND ANYMORE.
DID YOU STEAL KING TUT'S PENIS?
>> NO.
( LAUGHTER )
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
THAT CHECKS OUT.
HE'S CLEAN.
I JUST HAD TO MAKE SURE.
>> I'M GLAD YOU CHECKED.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
SO WHERE IS THE PENIS?
>> IT'S IN THE TOMB OF KING TUT
UNDERNEATH THE COVERING.
>> STEPHEN: I'LL PLAY YOUR GAME.
IN 2005, DR. ZAHI HAWASS,
SECRETARY-GENERAL OF
ANTIQUITIES, TOOK TUT OUT FOR A
CAT SCAN, AND HE CLAIMS THE
PENIS WAS IN THE SAND UNDERNEATH
THE MUMMY THE ENTIRE TIME.
>> IT WAS.
THAT'S WHAT HE CLAIMS, AND HE
HAD PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT.
>> STEPHEN: YOU'VE HEARD OF
PHOTOSHOP?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: IT WOULD BE SO EASY
TO PHOTOSHOP A PENIS.
I MEAN, I COULD SEND YOU TO SOME
WEB SITES, WEB SITES THAT SEEM
ALMOST ENTIRE DEDICATED TO
PHOTOSHOPING PENISES.
>> REALLY?
>> Stephen: YES.
YOU JUST GO TO GOOGLE IMAGE AND
PUT IN PENIS AND YOUR RESEARCH
IS ALMOST DONE FOR YOU.
ISN'T THE SIMPLER ANSWER SOMEONE
TOOK IT.
>> WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO
THAT?
>> STEPHEN: SMOKE IT, GET HIGH.
YOU KNOW THE CHINESE BUY TIGER
DONGS AND SNORT THAT FOR SEXUAL
PROWESS.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT HAS A
NARCOTIC KIND OF EFFECT?
>> STEPHEN: I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SMOKED PENIS.
>> HAVE YOU SEEN HIS PENIS WITH
YOUR OWN EYES?
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.
>> STEPHEN: YOU'RE WILLING TO
PUT YOUR ENTIRE CAREER, A
LIFETIME OF WORK ON THE LINE FOR
A PENIS YOU HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY
SEEN?
>> MY FEELING IS THAT THE TRUTH
HAS BEEN STATED BY DR. HAWASS,
AND I SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT
THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT
DENIAL IS NOT JUST A RIVER IN
EGYPT.
I'M BEING TOLD THAT IT IS JUST A
RIVER IN EGYPT.
I'M SORRY.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
EVEN IF I BUY INTO THIS
FANTASTICAL STORY THAT THERE IS
A PENIS THERE IN THE SAND THAT
NOBODY NOTICED FOR 40 YEARS AND
NOW IT'S MAGICALLY BEEN FOUND,
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THAT PENIS
BELONGS TO KING TUT?
IT COULD BE ANYBODY'S
3,000-YEAR-OLD PENIS.
HAVE THEY D.N.A. TESTED THE
PENIS TO MAKE SURE IT IS KING
TUT'S.
>> I DEMAND THE EGYPTIAN
GOVERNMENT ALLOW ME TO GO INTO
WHERE KING TUT'S MUMMY IS HELD
TO PERFORM D.N.A. TESTS ON THAT
PENIS TO MAKE SURE IT BELONG TO
KING TULT.
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?
>> IF YOU RECEIVE PERMISSION
FROM DR. ZAHI HAWASS, I WOULD
CERTAINLY GO ALONG WITH YOU
>> ALL RIGHT.
DR. SILVERMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING ME SOLVE THE MYSTERY
OF KING TUT'S PENIS.
♪♪
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: LET'S TAKE THAT
BATTERIES OUT.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, DR. HAWASS?
THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT.
