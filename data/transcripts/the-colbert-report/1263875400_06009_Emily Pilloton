EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WANTS TO FIX
THE WORLD THROUGH HUMANITARIAN
DESIGN.
I BET YOU CAN'T IMPROVE ON MY
ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.
PLEASE WELCOME EMILY PILLOTON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT SAFELY OVER
HERE.
>> OUCH.
NOW, YOUNG LADY, WE'LL GET TO
WHY I GOT THE HERMAN MUNSTERS ON
IN A SECOND.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS
HUMANITARIAN DESIGN?
ARE YOU A HUMANITARIAN DESIGNER?
>> I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO.
YEAH, HUMANITARIAN DESIGN IS
REALLY ABOUT TAKING DESIGN AS A
CREATIVE PROCESS.
IT'S REALLY ABOUT PROBLEM
SOLVING AND PUTTING IT TO WORK
ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST SOCIAL
ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING TODAY,
SO INSTEAD OF JUST DESIGNING
STUFF, WE'RE LOOKING AT
SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR PEOPLE
THAT REALLY NEED THEM.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH
DESIGNING STUFF?
>> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
DESIGNING STUFF.
>> Stephen: I HAVE GREAT
STUFF.
>> I BET YOU DO.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU SEEN AN
IMPOD?
>> I HAVE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S REALLY
WELL-DESIGNED STUFF.
>> I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT TO
THE NEXT LEVEL.
>> Stephen: MAKE THEM THINNER
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW MY SHUFFLE IS
HALF THE SIZE OF MY PINKIE.
I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
EVENTUALLY I WANT TO BE ABLE TO
SHAVE WITH ONE.
BUT WHAT IS DESIGN THAT TAKES IT
BEYOND THAT?
WHAT'S YOUR GOAL BEYOND JUST
MAKING THINGS THAT LOOK COOL AND
WORK WELL?
>> WELL, I THINK YOU HIT THE
NAIL ON THE HEAD.
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE
THINGS THAT AREN'T JUST MEASURED
IN FORM AND FUNCTION BUT THINGS
THAT HAVE A POSITIVE SOCIAL
IMPACT WHERE WE CAN MEASURE
THEIR IMPACT WITHIN SOMEONE'S
LIFE WITHIN A COMMUNITY, EVEN
WITHIN AN ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: WHERE WHAT ARE
THESE THINGS?
>> THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED THE
SPIDER BOOT.
THESE ARE USED BY...
>> Stephen: WILL THIS GIVE ME
SPIDER SENSES?
>> YOUK SPIDER-LIKE COMING
ACROSS.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> THEY'RE USED WE LANDMINE
DETECTION TEAMS.
THE DESIGN TEAM WHEN THEY'RE
DOING THE RESEARCH ON THESE
DISCOVERED THAT THE BIGGEST
DANGER IN LOOKING FOR LANDMINES
IS NOT THE SHRAPNEL SHOULD ONE
EXPLODE, IT'S THE SHOCK WAVES
THAT GO UP THROUGH YOUR LEGS.
SO THIS DISTANCES YOUR FOOT FROM
THE SOURCE OF THE BLAST AND
SPREADS YOUR WEIGHT AMONGST
THOSE FOUR POINTS.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WELL, THAT'S COOL, PLUS THEY'D
BE GREAT TO BRING TO A DANCE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: NOW, WHAT IS THIS
RIGHT HERE?
>> SO THESE ARE CALLED ADAPTIVE
EYE CARE.
THESE ARE AFFORDABLE EYEGLASSES,
AND WHAT IS REALLY GREAT ABOUT
THEM IS IN MOST PEOPLE... AND
THEY'RE VERY STYLISH.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I FEEL LIKE DR.
DR. PERCY
>> VERY HARRY POTTER CHIC.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO I DO?
>> WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THEM IS
YOU F YOU LIVE IN THE DEVELOPING
WORLD AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD
EYEGLASSES OR YOU DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO AN EYE DOCTOR, YOU CAN
ADJUST THE PRESCRIPTION
YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: THESE LENSES ARE
TWO MEMBRANE PERFECTLY CLEAR
FILLED WITH WHAT?
>> A SILICONE OIL.
>> Stephen: I JUST ADJUST
THESE?
>> AS YOU ADJUST THEM, THE CON
CAVITY OF THE LENS CHANGES AND
IT CHANGES YOUR PRESCRIPTION.
>> Stephen: BETTER, BETTER,
WORSE, BETTER, BETTER, BETTER,
BETTER, BETTER.
THESE ARE NOW MY PRESCRIPTION.
>> PERFECT.
>> Stephen: WOW, THAT TOOK 15
SECONDS.
>> YEP, SO ANYONE CAN DO THAT.
THERE IS A LITTLE PIN.
YOU SCREW IT IN MACE, REMOVE THE
SYRINGES AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
>> Stephen: YOU MUST BE MAKING
A LOAD OFF THIS?
>> I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO
JOSHUA SILVER, A SCIENTIST IN
THE U.K.
>> Stephen: SERIOUSLY, ALL
THIS HUMANITARIAN DESIGN MUST BE
CHA-CHING BECAUSE BILLIONS OF
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE JACK IN THE
WORLD.
>> IT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: YOU COME UP WITH
WHAT THEY NEED, YOU MUST BE ABLE
TO MAKE A PRETTY PENNY ON THE
SIDE.
>> WELL, IN THEORY, BUT I WOULD
HOPE IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM
LINE SO MUCH AS WE LIKE TO
MEASURE THIS AS THE TRIPLE
BOTTOM LINE, SO IT'S PLANET,
PEOPLE AND PROFIT.
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE'RE
MAKING MONEY.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: OKAY.
HOW ABOUT MAKING THESE, BUT THEY
BUST IN A MONTH SO THEY HAVE TO
COME BACK.
>> WELL, THAT'S...
>> Stephen: YOU COULD DESIGN
THAT IN, COULDN'T YOU?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE
NOSE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE THING
TO DO, BUT YOU COULD.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO WE HAVE
RIGHT HERE?
I'D GET UP AND SHOW IT TO
PEOPLE, BUT I'M AFRAID I WOULD
SNAP MY ANKLE.
WHAT IS THIS?
>> Stephen: THIS IS SOMETHING
CALLED THE HIPPO ROLLER.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU ROLL
THAT AROUND?
>> I WOULD LOVE TO.
JIEX MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A VERY,
VERY SUSPICIOUS FLIGHT
ATTENDANT.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW WHAT IS THIS?
>> IT'S A WATER TRANSPORT BARREL
THAT'S USED IN THE DEVELOPING
WORLD, SPECIFICALLY IN SOUTH
AFRICA.
THIS BARREL HOLDS 22 GALLONS OF
WATER, AND FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT
LIVE THREE, FIVE, TEN KILOMETERS
FROM A WATER SOURCE, THEY'RE
ABLE TO MORE SAFELY AND
EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT WATER.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH WILL THAT
WEIGH WHEN IT'S FULL?
>> IF I WERE TO PICK IT UP, IT
WOULD WEIGH CLOSE TO 200 POUNDS,
BUT IT HAS AN EFFECTIVE WEIGHT
IF I'M PUSHING IT OF ONLY ABOUT
40.
>> Stephen: SO I CAN USE THIS
TO GET WATER TO MY VILLAGE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WALK IT RIGHT DOWN SIXTH AVENUE.
>> Stephen: WHEN I GET BACK TO
MY VILLAGE, AND I'M WEARING ONE
OF THESE, WILL ANY WOMAN MATE
WITH ME?
>> IF YOU'RE WEARING THE SHOE,
AS WELL, MAYBE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
