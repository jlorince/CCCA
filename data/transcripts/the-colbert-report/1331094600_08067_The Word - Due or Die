LISTEN, CHLAMYDIA IS NOT A
FLOWER.
SAD.
NATION, I HAVE NEVER LIKED
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER.
I CAN'T FORGIVE HIM FOR SELLING
OUT HAN SOLO TO BOBA FETT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT HE HAS DONE ONE GOOD THING.
HE SIGNED OFF ON THE DRONE
STRIKE THAT KILLED JIHADI CLERIC
AND AMERICAN CITIZEN ANWAR
AL-AWLAKI IN YEMEN.
NOW HOLDER'S GOTTEN A LOT OF
CRITICISM FOR THE LEGAL
JUSTIFICATION HE GAVE FOR
KILLING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
NONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S WORD:  DO OR DIE
WHEN THEY TOOK OUT AL AWLAKI
LAST YEAR, THE OBAMA JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT WROTE A MEMO
EXPLAINING WHY THIS ACTION WAS
LEGAL, BUT THEN KEPT THE MEMO
SECRET.
WHY?
DOES KILLING AMERICAN CITIZENS
SOMEHOW REQUIRE ELEVEN HERBS AND
SPICES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE COLONEL WAS IN THE MILITARY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT YESTERDAY THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL EXPLAINED WHY IT'S
PERFECTLY LEGAL TO EXECUTE A
CITIZEN WITHOUT TRIAL.
>> THE SUPREME COURT HAS MADE
CLEAR THAT THE DUE PROCESS
CLAUSE DOES NOT IMPOSE
ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL  REQUIREMENTS.
DUE PROCESS AND JUDICIAL
PROCESS ARE NOT ONE AND THE
SAME, PARTICULARLY, WHEN IT
COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY.
THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES DUE
PROCESS.
IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE JUDICIAL
PROCESS.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY. DUE PROCESS
DOES NOT MEAN JUDICIAL PROCESS.
THE FOUNDERS WEREN'T PICKY.
I MEAN TRIAL BY JURY, TRIAL BY
FIRE, ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS --
WHO CARES?
DUE PROCESS JUST MEANS THERE'S A
PROCESS THAT YOU DO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
THE CURRENT PROCESS IS
APPARENTLY:  FIRST, THE
PRESIDENT MEETS WITH HIS
ADVISERS AND DECIDES WHO HE CAN
KILL. THEN, HE KILLS THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD THESE
POWERS EVER SINCE CONGRESS
PASSED THE "AUTHORIZATION FOR
THE USE OF FORCE" BILL, AFTER
LONG AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION
THREE DAYS AFTER 9/11.
[ LAUGHTER ]
JIM?
>> IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS
PERPETRATED -- AND THE
CONTINUING THREAT POSED -- - BY
AL QAEDA, THE TALIBAN, AND
ASSOCIATED FORCES, CONGRESS HAS
AUTHORIZED THE PRESIDENT TO USE
ALL NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE
FORCE AGAINST THOSE GROUPS.
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS IN
AN ARMED CONFLICT, WE ARE
AUTHORIZED TO TAKE ACTION
AGAINST ENEMY BELLIGERENTS UNDER
INTERNATIONAL LAW.
>> Stephen: YES.
IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL TO BLOW UP
AL AWALAKI BECAUSE WE ARE IN A
DECLARED ARMED CONFLICT WITH
YEMEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PAKISTAN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
AFGHANISTAN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I KNOW IT'S A STAN.
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT TROOPS IN
ENEMY TERRITORY.
TERROR!
WE'RE AT "WAR WITH TERROR!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEREFORE, THE PRESIDENT CAN
BLOW UP ANY AMERICAN CITIZEN HE
CHOOSES UNTIL WE WIN THE WAR BY
DEFEATING THE IDEA OF BEING
AFRAID.
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS WE'RE
CALLING SOMETHING A WAR MAKES
THE PRESIDENT JUDGE, JURY, AND
EXECUTIONER, WHY DON'T WE LET
HIM CALL IN DRONE STRIKES IN THE
WAR ON DRUGS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW ABOUT THE WAR ON POVERTY?
LET'S THROW THE HOMELESS INTO
GITMO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THE
PRESIDENT WILL USE HIS NEWLY
EXPLAINED AUTHORITY TO CARPET
BOMB THE CUPCAKE WARS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOR THOSE WHO STILL WHINE
THAT ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS MUST
RECEIVE "JUDICIAL PROCESS,"
BEFORE THEY'RE EXECUTED, LET'S
MEET THEM HALFWAY AND PUT
JUDGE'S ROBES ON OUR MISSILES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO WIN
OUR NEVER-ENDING WAR AGAINST
TERROR, THERE ARE BOUND TO BE
CASUALTIES, AND ONE JUST HAPPENS
TO BE THE CONSTITUTION.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
