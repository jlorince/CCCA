>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, THANK YOU.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MITT ROMNEY HAS ELECTRIFIED THE REPUBLICAN BASE.
THANKS TO THE INSPIRING WORSD OF HIS NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, DE FACTO.
AND M ITT IS REALLY CONNECTING TO AVERAGE VOTERS LIKE THIS CASUAL GET TOGETHER LAST WEEK WHEN HE
ACCIDENTALLY CAME ACROSS THESE FOUR RANDOM PITTSBURGH COUPLES HAVING A PICNIC WITH
THEIR PET FLAG STRIPEY.
BUT AS SOMETIMES HAPPENS DURING MITT'S DAILY MINUTE OF RESPOND TAN AITY THERE
WERE 59 SECONDS OF AWKWARDNESS,
JIM.
>> ROMNEY IS COMING UNDER SOME FIRE FOLLOWING COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT COOKIES FROM A
PITTSBURGH AREA BAKERY.
THE OWNER OF THE BAKERY, A LOCAL INSTITUTION DECIDED TO SENDS THE PRESIDENTIAL
HOPEFUL SOME COOKIES WHEN HE CAME TO DOWN BUT WHEN THE MOMENT OF TRUTH CAME ROMNEY
DID NOT SEEM IMPRESSED.
>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THESE COOKIES.
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE HE MADE THEM.
DID YOU MAKE THOSE COOKIES.
>> NO, NO THEY CAME FROM THE LOCAL 7-11 BAKERY, OR WHEREVER.
NOW IT'S A LITTLE RUDE BUT MAY I POINT OUT, HE DIDN'T FIRE THEM.
IT TURNS OUT THE BETHEL BAKERY IS THE PRIDE OF PITTSBURGH.
BUT HOW WAS MITT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PITTSBURGH IS PROUD OF?
(LAUGHTER) PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET MITT ROMNEY'S SENSE OF HUMOR.
IT'S LIKE THAT TIME HE GREETED NASCAR FANS WEARING DOLLAR PONCHOS BY SAYING I
LIKE THOSE FANCY RAIN COAT OS YOU BOUGHT, REALLY SPRUNG FOR THE BIG BUCKS.
IT WAS A JOKE.
HE KNOWS THEY'RE POOR.
THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY.
FOLKS, I AM INSULTED, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, I AM INSULTSED BY THE IDEA THAT
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PICK THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD BASED ON SOMETHING AS FRIVOLOUS ON WHETHER HE
INSULTED COOKIES.
THEY SHOULD BASE IT ON WHETHER HE HARMED A DOG.
NOW FOR MONTHS COMMENTATORS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FAMOUS ROMNEY FAMILY ROAD
TRIP WHERE ROMNEY TIED THEIR DOG IN A CRATE TO THE ROOF OF THE CAR.
BY THE WAY, POTENTIAL ROMNEY RUNNING MATE, ARRANGE YOUR OWN TRANSPORTATION.
WELL, THE FACT IS WE NOW LEARN SHAMOUS HAD A GREAT TIME, JUST ASK ANN ROMNEY.
>> THE DOG LOVED IT HE WOULD SEE THAT CRATE AND, YOU KNOW,
HE WOULD LIKE GO CRAZY BECAUSE HE WAS GOING WITH US ON VACATION.
>> Stephen: YEAH, HE LOVED IT.
IN FACT, HE ALWAYS ASKED FOR IT, ROOF, ROOF, ROOF.
(APPLAUSE) THAT'S WHY HE LOVED IT SO MUCH, THAT'S WHY MITT'S OLDs
SON TAG NOTICED A BROWN LIQUID RUNNING DOWN THE REAR WINDOW OF THE FAMILY STATION WAGON.
WELL, FOR SOME REASON, THAT MYSTERIOUS BROWN LIQUID HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A STAIN ON
ROMNEY'S REPUTATION.
BUT I FOR ONE AM HAPPY TO REPORT THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN HAS FOUND AN OBAMA DOG STORY
EVEN MORE DAMAGING.
LISTEN TO OBAMA'S OWN VOICE DESCRIBE FOOD HIS STEPFATHER FED HIM AS A SMALL CHILD IN INDONESIA.
>> AND AWAY FROM THE DINNER TABLE I WAS INTRODUCED TO DOG MEAT, TOUGH.
SNAKE MEAT, TOUGHER, AND ROASTED GRASSHOPPER.
>> CRUNCHY.
>> Stephen: THAT WAS FROM OBAMA'S BEST SELLING BOOK.
IT WAS EITHER DREAMS FROM MY FATHER, OR THE SEQUEL, DOG MEAT FROM MY STEPFATHER.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S FUN, IT'S FUN.
I WONDER WHAT OBAMA'S FAVORITE DISH WAS, GERMAN SHEPHERD PIE WITH A SIDE OF
BICHON FRIES OR LAB RADOODLES WITH STEAMED CAULIFLOWER AND HEARTS OF POMERANIAN?
HOUND CAKE.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I BELIEVE ANYTHING ITS PRESIDENT OBAMA DID AS A TEN-YEAR-OLD IS THE SAME AS
ANYTHING ROMNEY DID AS AN ADULT.
(LAUGHTER) AND I HAVE FOUND EXPLOSIVE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT HE SUPPORTS PIRATES.
SOMEONE HAS TO HELP THAT WOMAN, CALL SEAL TEAM 6.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
