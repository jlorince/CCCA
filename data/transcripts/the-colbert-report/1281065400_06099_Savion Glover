EVERYBODY.
AGAIN.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN CALLED THE GREATEST TAP DANCER IN THE WORLD.
THEN HOW COME I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT"?
PLEASE WELCOME SAVION GLOVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, WELCOME.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHARE YOUR ART.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: IT IS AN ART, IT IS NOT?
>> IT IS.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ART.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED A SAVIOR.
WHO ARE YOU SAVING US FROM?
WHAT FORCES ARE A RAID AGAINST CAP, TRYING TO KEEP IT DOWN?
>> WELL, I'M LESS OF A SAINT.
I WOULD BE MAYBE CONSIDERED A DISCIPLE, NOT A SAVIOR, BUT A SEE SIGN L.
>> Stephen: A DISCIPLE, BUT NOT THE JUDAS OF TAP.
YOU'RE LIKE THE ST. PETER OF TAP?
>> MORE LIKE THE ST. JIMMY SLIDE.
>> Stephen: I HAVE NEVER READ THE GOSPEL OF ST.
JIMMY SLIDE.
WELL, HOW LONG HAS TAP BEEN AROUND?
>> OH, WE DON'T KNOW.
TAP HAS BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS AIR HAS BEEN AROUND.
>> Stephen: SO LIKE THE MID-20s.
[LAUGHTER]
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
>> I'D SAY A LITTLE FURTHER BACK.
>> Stephen: TAP WAS SO POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE HEYDEY, THE GOLDEN AGE OF MOVIES.
YOU HAD TO HAVE A TAP DANCE.
THEY WEDGED THEM INTO CRIME FILMS.
YOU HAD TO HAVE TAP DANCER.
WHAT STOPPED IT FROM BEING LIKE THE ULTIMATE ENTERTAINMENT?
DID ROCK 'N' ROLL HURT IT IN THE '50s?
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT WAS ROCK 'N' ROLL.
YOU KNOW, TAP DANCING WAS ALWAYS BEING DONE.
NOW, THE LACK OF POPULARITY,
THAT'S DUE TO I GUESS, WHAT DO YOU SAY, EVOLUTION, YOU KNOW, TV CHANGES, THINGS GROW, BUT TAP
DANCING WAS ALWAYS BEING DONE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT YOUR TAP DANCING?
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT TAP IS TO YOU?
IS IT THE PHYSICALITY OR IS IT THE SOUND YOU'RE MAKING?
>> I'D HAVE TO SAY NOW FOR ME IT'S THE SOUND.
I BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW, MY APPROACH TO THIS DANCE IS BETTER HEARD THAN SEEN.
>> Stephen: SO IF YOU HAD THE CHOOSE, YOU'D RATHER HAVE AN ALL-BLIND AUDIENCE THAN AN
ALL-DEAF AUDIENCE.
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE?
>> I WOULD PREFER AN ALL-BLIND AUDIENCE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> YES, YES.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALSO ARE TEACHING TAP ALL AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND TEACHING TEACHERS OF TAP.
>> YES, WE ARE.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHOW US WHAT YOU TEACH THEM?
>> I AM HAPPY TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SAVION GLOVER AND FRIENDS.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERING]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS SO MUCH.
