NEW YORK, THE LARGEST IN THEWORLD, SAY THEY WILL NOW ALLOW
GAYS TO MARCH NEXT YEAR UNDER
THEIR OWN BANNER FOR THE FIRSTTIME.
>> IN THE PAST, GROUPS HAD BEENPROHIBITED FROM MARCHING WITH
BANNERS IDENTIFYING THEM AS GAY.
>> STEPHEN: GAYS IN THEST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE!
WE IRISH SHOULD HAVE SEEN THISCOMING.
FIRST THEY STOLE OUR RAINBOWS.
NEXT THEY'LL BE COMING AFTER MELUCKY CHARMS!
NEXT THEY'LL BE COMING AFTER MELUCKY CHARMS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I'M NOT ONLY A PROUD IRISH
CATHOLIC, I'M AS STRAIGHT ASTHEY COME.
I EVEN MADE SURE THE BLARNEYSTONE WASN'T A DUDE BEFORE I
KISSED IT.
(LAUGHTER)AND, AT FIRST, I LIKED THE IDEA
OF MAKING GAYS MARCH WITH ABANNER IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES.
(LAUGHTER)BUT LUCKILY, BEFORE I BECAME TOO
OKAY WITH THE IDEA, FOX NEWSREMINDED ME I WAS OUTRAGED.

ALLOWED IN THIS YEAR'SST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.

BECAUSE A GAY GROUP WILL MARCHIN THE ST. PATRICK'S VALEN --
UH -- ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.

STEVE DOOCY'S SO MAD, HE CAN'TEVEN SAY A COHERENT SENTENCE ON
CAMERA.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
HE'S CLEARLY BEEN FURIOUS ABOUTTHIS FOR YEARS!
AND REMEMBER, AND REMEMBER, THEYSAID
CATHOLIC LEADERS.
HE PROBABLY MEANS BILL DONOHUE,HEAD OF THE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE
CATHOLIC LEAGUE, WHO SAID THEREWAS "NO CONTROVERSY."
(LAUGHTER)OKAY.
THAT OUTRAGE WAS MORE NUANCEDTHAN I EXPECTED, BUT HE'S NOT AN
OFFICIAL LEADER OF THE CHURCH.
