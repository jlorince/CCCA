(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU BUT I AM SICK TO DEATH
OF THE MEDIA HOUNDING HERMAN
CAIN OVER HIS SEXUAL
HARASSMENT SETTLEMENT WITH
TWO OR THREE OF HIS FORMER
EMPLOYEES.
AND NOW ONE OF THE SETTLES
MIGHT GO PUBLIC JUST BECAUSE
HER LAWYER CLAIMS THAT
HERMAN CAIN BROKE THE
CONFIDENTIALITY TERMS OF THE
AGREEMENT BY COMMENTING ON
ITS SPECIFICS.
HEY, CAIN DIDN'T COMMENT ON
IT HE WENT ON TV AND
GESTURED ON IT, AND HELD A
PRESS CONFERENCE, AND SANG
ON IT ♪ AMAZING GRACE ♪
♪ WILL ALWAYS BE ♪
♪ MY THOUGHT OF PRAISE ♪
♪.
>> Stephen: YES, AMAZING
GRACE WILL ALWAYS BE HIS
SONG OF PRAISE, EXCEPT WHEN
HE'S SINGING THIS SONG WHICH
IS ABOUT THE SONG AMAZING
GRACE BUT APPEARS TO BE SUNG
TO THE TUNE OF DANNY BOY.
JUST LIKE I SING ABOUT
LOVING DANNY BOY TO THE TUNE
OF STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.
♪ THERE'S A SONG THAT I
LOVE ♪
♪ AND IT'S CALLED DANNY
BOY ♪
♪ AND I ONLY SING THAT SONG
NOT THIS ONE ♪
♪ THAT MAKES ME WONDER ♪
♪ ANYWAY, THAT'S THE SONG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I AWAIT YOUR
LAWSUIT.
THE FACT IS, WE ALL KNOW
THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE ONLY
ABOUT ONE THING.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT HERMAN
CAIN SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR
MORE OF THIS BECAUSE HE IS A
BLACK CONSERVATIVE?
>> HERMAN CAIN REPRESENTS A
THREAT TO LIBERAL-- A
LIBERAL NARRATIVE THAT
SUGGESTS THAT CONSERVATIVES
ARE RACIST.
>> THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAVE
LAUNCHED AN UNCONSCIONABLE
RACIALLY STEREOTYPICAL
ATTACK ON AN INDEPENDENT,
SELF-RELIANT CONSERVATIVE
BLACK.
>> Stephen: YES, IT IS A
STEREOTYPE, NOT ALL BLACK
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
SEXUALLY HARASS.
JUST LIKE NOT ALL OLD FAT
MEN ARE JOLLY.
AND--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, WHEN IT
COMES TO RACIAL STEREOTYPES,
RUSH KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING
ABOUT IT.
>> LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS
WAY, THE NFL ALL TOO OFTEN
LOOKS LIKE A GAME BETWEEN
THE BLOODS AND THE CRIPS
WITHOUT ANY WEAPONS.
>> DAY, DAY MARK AND THE
STANDARD.
WHO DATA.
WHO DATA SAY THEY MOCKING
THE STANDARD, AL SHARPTON
SAY DAY MOCKING THE
STANDARD.
HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY THINK
OF OBAMA AS BLACK.
HE'S NOT FROM THE HOOD.
HE'S NOT FROM THE MOVEMENT.
WHEN I HEAR CHINESE OR
JAPANESE T SOUNDS LIKE ALL
THE SAME WORD.
>> Stephen: KHIE BA BA
INDEED.
LITTLE KNOWN FACT RUSH WAS
ALSO THE VOICE OF JAR JAR
PINKS.
BUT FOLKS, THIS IS NOT GOING
TO DERAIL THE CAIN TRAIN.
>> NONE OF THIS APPEARS TO
BE HURTING MR. CAIN IN TERMS
OF FUND-RAISING.
HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER MARK
BLOUNT MADE ALL THIS
CONTROVERSY.
THE CAMPAIGN MANAGED TO
RAISE ABOUT $250,000.

THAT PRETTY LITTLE MOUTH OF
YOURS.
>> I GOT TO GO ON A COFFEE
RUN.
