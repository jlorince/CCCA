DEMAND.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE
BIG GOVERNMENT NANNY STATE IS
SMOTHERING US IN BUZZ-KILLING
REGULATIONS.
IF I CAN'T BRING A GUN ON A
PLANE, WHO'S GOING TO KILL THE
PANTHER I ALSO BROUGHT ON THE
PLANE?
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, TONIGHT... PRETTY ANIMAL.
SO TONIGHT I PROFILE ONE
DO-GOODER WHOSE DO-GOODING DONE
GONE DO-BAD.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
DESTROYING AMERICA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IF THERE'S ONE THING AMERICA
LOVES, IT'S POWER TOOLS.
AND NOTHING SAYS POWER LIKE A
TABLE SAW.
NINE INCHES OF STEEL POWERED BY
A DUAL HORSEPOWER MOTOR SPINNING
AT 5,000 R.P.M. JUST LOOK HOW
AMPED WOODWORKER PETE PERILLO
GETS.
>> IT'S... IT'S... THERE'S SOME
EXCITEMENT, LET'S PUT IT THAT
WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE SOUND, THE POWER, THE
VIBRATION, THE ENERGY.
>> Stephen: YEAH!
THE ENERGY TO RIP THROUGH
ANYTHING.
SHOES, MEAT, COMPUTERS,
BREAKFAST CEREALS, EVEN FINGERS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> AFTER I FINISHED A CUT I
REACHED ACROSS THE TOP OF THE
TABLE SAW.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
AND THE BLADE WAS SPINNING AND
THAT'S HOW I SEVERED MY FINGER.
I MADE A CARELESS MISTAKE.
SO THERE'S NOBODY TO BLAME OTHER
THAN MYSELF.
>> Stephen: BUT INVENTOR STEVE
GAS DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
>> I'M ON A PERSONAL MISSION TO
MAKE TABLE SAWS SAFER.
>> Stephen: SAFE SAWING?
THAT'S LIKE WEARING CONDOMS ON
YOUR HANDS WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS
WOODWORKING FEELS BEST
BARE-BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
AND JUST WHY IS GAS SO
CONCERNED?
>> TABLE SAWS ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR SENDING ABOUT
40,000 PEOPLE A YEAR TO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM.
ABOUT
4,000 OF THOSE END UP LOSING ONE
OR MORE FINGERS.
>> Stephen: SURE, 4,000 FINGERS
A YEAR SOUNDS BAD, BUT WHEN YOU
BREAK IT DOWN, THAT'S JUST TEN
FINGERS A DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT STEVE GAS HAS GOT A SAFETY
FETISH.
SO THIS FINGER-HUGGER INVENTED
SAW STOP.
>> SAW STOP WORKS BY SENSING
WHEN YOU RUN YOUR FINGER INTO
THE BLADE ON A TABLE SAW AND
THEN STOPPING THE BLADE SO
QUICKLY THAT YOU JUST GET A
LITTLE NICK INSTEAD OF CUTTING
YOUR FINGERS OFF.
>> Stephen: HOW WELL DOES IT
WORK?
HERE'S A REGULAR TABLE SAW.
IMAGINE THIS DELICIOUS SAUSAGE
FEST IS YOUR HAND.
NOW THAT'S A POWER TOOL.
NOW LET'S TRY THE SAME TASK ON A
SAW STOP.
WAY TO PUSSY OUT, SOFT STOP.
(LAUGHTER)
LUCKILY, EVERY TABLE SAW
MANUFACTURER THAT GAS SHOWED HIS
SAW TO PROTECTED US FROM HIS
PROTECTING US.
THE POWER TOOL TRADE ASSOCIATION
REJECTED HIS DESIGN SAYING SOFT
STOP COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE THE
ACCIDENT RATE.
BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE OUR
FINGERS A FALSE SENSE OF
SECURITY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT TIMMY TEN-FINGERS DOESN'T
GET IT.
HE ACTUALLY WANTS BIG GOVERNMENT
TO FORCE SAW MANUFACTURERS TO
ADOPT THIS TECHNOLOGY AND MAKE
THEIR SAWS AFRAID OF YOUR
FINGERS, TOO.
BOB ADLER OF THE CONSUMER
PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION.
>> WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO
INCORPORATE A TECHNOLOGY LIKE
SAW STOP INTO THEIR PRODUCTS.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT DOES HE
WANT?
THE NANNY STATE DICTATING OUR
LIVES?
>> I COULD IMAGINE HAVING A
NANNY-LIKE MARY POP PINS WHO IS
ALL-KNOWING AND EXTREMELY
COMFORTING AND NICE.
>> Stephen: NICE?
(SCREAMING)
THIS IS YOUR VISION OF AMERICA,
SIR?
>> CAN I STOP FOR A SECOND?
>> Stephen: YEAH, LET'S STOP.
STOP SAW STOP.
AND STOP ASSAULTING OUR
GOD-GIVEN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
>> I HAVE THE RIGHT TO CUT MY
OWN FINGER OFF ON MY TABLE SAW
IF I WANT TO.
>> Stephen: AND WHO WOULDN'T
WANT TO?
AMERICA, WE CANNOT LET THESE
DIGIT-CODDLERS EMASCULATE THE
GREAT AMERICAN SAW-SCAPE.
THEY MAY WANT TO SAVE OUR
FINGERS, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO SAVE
OUR BALLS.
(LAUGHTER)
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
RIGHT, PETE?
>> I'LL GIVE UP MY SAW WHEN YOU
TAKE IT OUT OF MY COLD NINE AND
A HALF FINGERS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
