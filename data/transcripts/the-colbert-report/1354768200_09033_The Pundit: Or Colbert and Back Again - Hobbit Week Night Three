>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
I GOTTA SAY, I LOVE THIS LITTLE GOLDEN THING.
I'M GOING TO USE IT TO SNEAK INTO HOG WARTS TO STEAL THAT INVISIBILITY CLOAK.
FOLKS, IT IS NIGHT THREE OF BIT WEEK.OFHO WE'VE HAD IAN MCKELLAN, MARTIN FREEMAN, AND TONIGHT ANDY CIRCUS.
( APPLAUSE ) MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE, OF COURSE, "WHAT DO I HAVE IN MY POCKETSES?" SHHH!
DON'T TELL.
MR. CIRCUS, OF COURSE, IS THE PIONEER IN THE ART OF PERFORMANCE CAPTURE.
HE HAS PLAYED SO MANY OF THE GREAT COMPUTER-GENERATED CHARACTERS, NOT JUST GOLLAN, BUT
KING KONG, CAESAR FROM "PLANET OF THE APES" AND OF COURSE ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT'S DANIEL DAY LEWIS.
OF COURSE, HOBIT HEADS LIKE ME CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND LUCKILY, WE DON'T HAVE TO,
THANKS TO THE WIZARDS AT DENNY'S WHO ARE BRINGING THE SPIRIT OF MIDDLE EARTH TO THE MIDDLE OF
THE I-80 ROUTE 126 INTERCHANGE.
LORD JIM.
>> FIRST, I WILL HAVE THE SKILLET.
NEXT, I SHALL SECURE SOME HOBIT HOLES WITH THE SIDE OF A PUMPKIN PANCAKE.
THAT SHOULD HOLD ME UNTIL SECOND BREAKFAST.
>> EAT LIKE A HOBIT, ONLY AT DENNY'S.
>> Stephen:  YES, EAT LIKE A HOBIT, BECAUSE AT DENNY'S, YOU CAN'T EAT LIKE A HUMAN.
( LAUGHTER ).
OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY, FOLKS TOLKEN WAS AN OXFORD PROFESSOR WHO WITH THE SIMPLE FANTASY
NOVEL EXPLOREDDED LINK BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND THE SHARED MYTHOLOGICAL THEMES.
HE PROBABLY GETS THE GANDOLF-GOBBLE-MELT.
REMEMBER TO SLATHER IT WITH GANDOLF GRAVY.
OR MAYBE GET THE RING BURGER, WHICH THE LEGENDS SAY WILL TURN YOUR INTESTINES INTO GHOUL
( LAUGHTER ) SO BE SURE TO TRY EVERY HOBIT MEAL.
THEY'RE A DELICIOUS TRIBUTE TO A BELOVED CHILDREN'S BOOK, THOUGH THE BREAKFAST HAS A MUCH DARKER ENDING.
