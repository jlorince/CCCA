WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US.
NATION, YOU KNOW I LOVE A SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER WEEKEND.
I TOOK THE KIDS, BROUGHT OUR OWN SNACKS, QUICK TIP, DON'T LET THE THEATRES GOUGE YOU
ON POPCORN.
DO WHAT I DO.
FILL YOUR POCKETS WITH UNPOPPED COLONELS AND A DOZEN CHEAP CELL PHONES.
NOW FOLKS LIKE THE REST OF AMERICA I WAS TOTALLY GEEKING OUT THIS WEEKEND TO
SEE THE EPIC ADVENTURE OF THE ETERNAL CHILD HERO IN THE ADOREABLE GLASSES WHO IS
MANKIND'S ONLY HOPE.
SARAH PALIN.
(APPLAUSE) I SAW HER IN THE DOCUMENTARY OF HER LIFE "THE UNDEFEATED"
ALSO, LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT HARRY POTTER MOVIE.
APPARENTLY THAT CAME OUT THIS WEEKEND TOO.
THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE ADVERTISED IT.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
FOLKS, THESE TWO WOULD MAKE A GREAT DOUBLE FEATURE BECAUSE BOTH MOVIES ARE
ABOUT OUTSIDERS PLUCKED FROM OBSCURITY BY AN OLD WIZARD.
(LAUGHTER) AND BOTH HEROES ENCOUNT ERRED DEER IN THE FOREST.
THAT, OF COURSE S HARRY PATRONUS WHO SARAH PILLIN SHOT AND MOUNTED IN HER DEN.
(APPLAUSE) AND JUST LIKE HARRY POTTER 7 THE UNDEFEATED IS SHATTERING ALL RECORDS.
IT MAY NOT HAVE MADE NEARLY $170 MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE BUT ON ROTTEN TOMATOES IT DID RECEIVE A
PERFECT SCORE OF 0.
(APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT.
ZERO.
REVIEWERS FOUND ZERO FAULT WITH THIS MOVIE.
NOW FOLKS, GO SEE IT.
