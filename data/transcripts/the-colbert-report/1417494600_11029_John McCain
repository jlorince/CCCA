NOW YOU ARE A FIVETIME-- U.S. SENATOR.

WATER INTO WINE, THE WINETHAT HE MAKES OUT OF THE
WATER IS PASSED AROUND TOTHE GUESTS AND THEY SAY
THOU HAST SAVED THEBEST FOR LAST.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO APPEALTO CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES
IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOURGOSPEL, SIR?
>> NOW I REMEMBER, THANK YOU FOR
REFRESHING MY MEMORY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, FATHER McCAIN.
NOW HOW WAS YOURTHANKSGIVING.
I KNOW YOU ARE A BIGGRILLER, DID YOU GRILL YOUR
OWN TURKEY.
>> NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUTFOUR FRIED TURKEYS AND
DIDN'T SET THE DECK ONFIRE ONCE.
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
>> DEEP-FRY YOUR TURKEYS, MYFRIENDS, YOU WILL NEVER GO
BACK TO ANYTHING ELSE IT ISKIND OF ADDICTIVE, A LITTLE
BIT LIKE SOME SUBSTANCESTHAT YOU USED TO USE.
>> Stephen: WE AGREEDBACKSTAGE WE WOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT MY CRACK HABIT.
>> THERE WE GO.
>> Stephen: NOW SIR, YOUHAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED 13
SOLDIERS, A PERSONAL HISTORYOF AMERICANS AT WAR.
>> YUP.
>> Stephen: WHY 13, THATSEEMS LIKE AN UNLUCKY
NUMBER.
>> ONE FOR EVERY MAJORCONFLICT WE HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN SINCE THEREVOLUTIONARY WAR, AND THE
DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS, MENAND WOMEN.
WE TOOK ONE INDIVIDUAL FOREACH CONFLICT AND TRIED TO
PUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THECONFLICT.
BUT ALSO DESCRIBED TO THEREADER EXACTLY WHAT THEY
WENT THROUGH, AND THEDIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES
OF DEFENDING YOUR COUNTRY.
THIS ONE, OUR FRIEND JOINEDAT AGE 15, THE REVOLUTIONARY
WAR, CHARLES MARTIN.
ALMOST STARVED TO DEATH.
FOUGHT IN SEVERAL BATTLESAND FINALLY WE WON,
OBVIOUSLY.
AND IT TOOK 30 YEARS.
>> Stephen: 15.
>> JOINED AT 15.
AND FOUGHT ALL THE WAYTHROUGH.
>> Stephen: AT 15 I WASSTILL WATCHING STAR WARS.
AT 50 I'M STILL WATCHINGSTAR WARS.
NOW I NEVER SERVED BECAUSEMY DOCTOR SAYS I HAVE AN
INCURABLE CONDITION CALLED IDIDN'T WANT TO.
BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM WHAT IHAVE READ AND WHAT I HAVE
HEARD FROM PEOPLE LIKEYOURSELF WHO DID SERVE IN
OUR WARS, THAT WAR ISHORRIBLE.
SHOULD BOOKS ABOUT WAR, IFTHEY'RE GOOD, ALSO BE IN
SOME WAYS HORRIBLE?
OR HORRIFYING.
>> AS LONG AS WE UNDERSTANDTHAT WAR IS TERRIBLE, IT'S
THE WORST OF ALL THINGS.
IT DESTROYS LIVES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU COVER ANYOF OUR PRESENT WARS IN THIS?
FOR INSTANCE BILL O'REILLYAND THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS?
>> THERE IS ONLY ONE HERO TOWRITE ABOUT THAT, AND THAT
IS BILL O'REILLY.
>> THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THERETHAT FOUGHT IN AFGHANISTAN,
SHE IS A MEDIC.
SHE-- MONICA THOMAS.
SHE WAS IN A CONVOY, HIT BYAN IED.
SHE RUSHED IN TO SAVE THELIVES AND SHE DID OF SEVERAL
OTHER OF HER COMRADES.
AND BY THE WAY, HER HEROISM ANDTHAT OF WOMEN LIKE HER
SHOULD PUT TO REST ANYDISCUSSION OR ARGUMENT
WHETHER WOMEN SHOULD SERVEIN COMBAT OR NOT.
>> WELL, LET'S TALKABOUT-- LET'S TALK
ABOUT-- LET'S TALK ABOUTWHAT IS GOING ON IN THE
MIDDLE EAST AND AFGHANISTAN.
>> YEP.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE SAID WEWILL HAVE BOOTS ON THE
GROUND IN SYRIA BY THE ENDOF THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR?
>> I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOWTHE PRESIDENT FEELS HIS
FORCE TO DO THAT, HECONTINUES TO TELL US WHAT WE
WANT AND END UP DOING IT, WENOW HAVE 1500 MORE AS YOU KNOW
RECENTLY.
AND NOW THESE PEOPLE AREN'TGOING AWAY.
>> Stephen: SHOULD WE HAVETROOPS.
>> WE SHOULD HAVE BOOTS ONTHE GROUND.
>> WE SHOULD HAVE MORE AIRCONTROLLERS, WE SHOULD HAVE
SPECIAL FORCES AND WE SHOULDHAVE INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE
BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY BEEFFECTIVE WITH THAT.
I DONE MEAN SENDING IN THE82nd AIRBORNE AND THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS.
>> Stephen: BUT WHY NOT SENDIN THE 82 AIRBORNE AND
THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS IF ITIS A BIG PROBLEM IF WE HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THESE GUYS, WHYPUSSY FOOT AROUND, WHY NOT
TROOP BOOT IT AROUND?
>> FIRST OF ALL, THEAMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD NOT
ACCEPT SUCH A THING.
>> Stephen: ISN'T LEADERSHIPABOUT SAYING NO, WE HAVE TO
DO THIS THING.
>> WE CAN GET THE JOB DONE.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE DIDN'TWANT THE SURGE WHEN THE
SURGE HAPPENED.
BUT AS YOU WOULD SAY, THESURGE WORKED.
ISN'T THIS A SURGE IN TOSYRIA?
>> IT IS.
BUT IT'S GOT TO IT BE DONEIN A WAY THAT WOULD BE MORE
EFFECTIVE THAN SENDING IN AWHOLE BUNCH OF TROOPS.
NOT SENDING IN THE LARGENUMBERS THAT WE DID IN IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN.
>> DIDN'T WE UNDERESTIMATEWHAT WE NEEDED TO DO IN
IRAQ AND THAT'S WHY THE WARTOOK SO LONG?
>> WE HAD A FLAWED POLICY.
BY THE WAY, I WAS AGAINST IT,SAID RUMSFELD OUGHT TO BE
FIRED.
GUYS LIKE YOU, YOU CALL METHE BRAVE MAVERICK.
NOW WHEN I SAID THAT OBAMAIS MISHANDLING IT, NOW HE IS
THE ANGRY OLD MAN.
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE I AMNOW.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUTYOU AND THE ANGRY OLD MAN
OF CHUCK HAGEL WHO JUST GOTTOSSED OUT THE DOOR BY
OBAMA.
YOU VOTED AGAINST HAGEL'SCONFIRMATION AS DID I, AT
HOME, YELLING AT THE SCREEN.
ARE YOU GLAD HE'S OUT?
>> I THINK THAT CHUCK AND BYTHE WAY HE IS A FRIEND AND
HE'S A DISTINGUISHEDAMERICAN.
HE FOUGHT AS AN ENLISTED MANDURING THE VIETNAM WAR AND I
HONOR THAT.
BUT HE WASN'T THE RIGHT GUYFOR THE JOB.
AND IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THATALL THE DECISIONS ARE BEING
MADE WITHIN A SMALL GROUP INTHE WHITE HOUSE.
>> SO WE NEED SOMEBODY WHOHAS GOT EXPERIENCE.
YOU'RE HERE FOR THE COLBERTBUMP.
IS THIS A TRIAL BALLOON TOBE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE?
>> ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING,ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING
ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENTAGAIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU WOULD HAVE THE FULLRESOURCES OF THE COLBERT
REPORT AT YOUR BACK IN 2016.
IF IT WERE STILL ON THE AIR.
SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR JOINING ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 13
SOLDIERS.
GO GET IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
