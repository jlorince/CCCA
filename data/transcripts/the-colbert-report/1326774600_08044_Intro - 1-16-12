SUPERPAC RELEASES ITS FIRST
AD, BUT DON'T WORRY AS MY
MOUTH SAYS THOSE WORDS IT'S
NOT COORDINATING WITH MY
BRAIN.
THEN I REVEAL MY PLAN FOR
THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY
AS SOON AS SOMEONE REVEALS

IS A RELIGEOUS ACTIVIST
FIGHTING TO OVERTURN
ALABAMA'S ANTI-IMMIGRANT

GOOD THING HE'S RELIGIOUS
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO NEED A

HAPPY MARTIN LUTHER KING

I DON'T SEE RACE BUT I DO
SEE HOLIDAYS WHEN I SHOULD
NOT BE WORKING.
