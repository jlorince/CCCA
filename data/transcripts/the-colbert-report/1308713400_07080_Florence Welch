EVERYBODY.
WELCOME BACK
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE LEAD
SINGER OF FLORENCE AND THE
MACHINE.
FUN FACT: TURNS OUT, HER LAST
NAME IS NOT "ANDTHEMACHINE."
PLEASE WELCOME FLORENCE WELCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, FLORENCE, LOVELY TO MEET
YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: BESIDES BEING JUST
A SLIP OF A THING, YOU ARE ALSO
A YOUNG THIN.
TWO YEARS AGO YOU WERE
DISCOVERED, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
SINGING DRUNKENLY --
[LAUGHTER]
-- IN A GIRL'S BATHROOM.
TRUE?
>> IT'S TRUE ACTUALLY, YES.
>> Stephen: IT'S TRUE.
EVERY TIME I DRINK AND GO SING
IN A GIRL'S BATHROOM I GET IN
TROUBLE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY IS IT DIFFERENT FOR YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> MY MANAGER WAS RUNNING A CLUB
NIGHT IN SOHO AND I WENT THERE
AND WE WENT INTO THE BATHROOM TO
TALK ABOUT BOYS AND I WAS
PRETENDING I HAD A BAND BUT I
DIDN'T.
I SAID I CAN SING.
I SUNG HER A SNIP ET OF THIS
ETTA JAMES SONG AND SHE PUT ME
TO PLAY AT A CHRIS PASS PARTY.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE ON TOUR IN
THE UNITED STATES.
IT'S CALLED THE COSMIC -- GRAMMY
NOMINATED.
NOT A GRAMMY WINNER.
OOM A GRAMMY WINNER.
YOU LOST TO SPAULDING.
YOU WERE ROBBED.
I SHOULD HAVE LOST TO JUSTIN
BEIBER.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU STARTED OFF IN ART SCHOOL,
RIGHT?
AND THEN YOU DROPPED OUT OF ART
SCHOOL TO BE A ROCK STAR.
ARE YOU -- AND YOU'RE A RED
HEAD.
[LAUGHTER]
ARE YOU A HANDFUL?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I THINK ON STAGE IS MOSTLY
WHERE -- IT'S LIKE AN OUTLET SO
I DON'T HAVE TO BE IN TROUBLE ON
OFF STAGE BECAUSE I GET IT ALL
OUT ON STAGE.
>> Stephen: IF YOU DIDN'T
PERFORM YOU MIGHT BE TROUBLE?
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE A LOT
DRUNKER THAN I AM IF I DIDN'T
HAVE PERFORMING TO DO.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE SONG
YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR US
TONIGHT?
>> WE'RE GOING TO "DOG DAYS".
>> Stephen: OH, FANTASTIC.
ARE YOU GOING TO SING NOW?
>> I'M GOING TO CHANGE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, FANTASTIC.
MAYBE I SHOULD, TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH A PERFORMANCE BY "FLORENCE
AND THE MACHINE".
