>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, YOU'RE IN FOR A REAL
TREAT TONIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE A
BROADCAST LEGEND WHO WILL BE
INTERVIEWING TOM BROKAW.
PLEASE WELCOME, TOM BROKAW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TOM, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE, STEPHEN.
>>
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S NO
AVOIDING IT.
IT'S A TOUGH SUBJECT.
THIS SUNDAY IS THE TENTH
ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11.
>> YES, IT IS.
>> STEPHEN: UM  EVERYBODY IS
TALKING ABOUT IT ON ALL THE NEWS
CHANNELS.
AS SOMEBODY WHO ANCHORED THE
ENTIRE DAY, IS IT HARD FOR YOU
TO REVISIT IT AS IT IS FOR ME TO
WATCH IT?
>> IN MANY WAYS IT'S INSTRUCTIVE
FOR ME TO REVISIT IT BECAUSE
I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM
TALKING TO THE SURVIVORS THAT
GOT OUT OF TOWERS, THE WIDOWS,
THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WENT
THROUGH THAT ORDER DEAL.
IT CAUSES ME AS WELL TO TURN THE
CLOCK BACK AND TRY TO REMEMBER
WHAT I WAS THINKING.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT WERE YOU
DOING?
THAT MORNING WHEN WERE YOU
DOING?
>> MY WIFE HAD JUST GOTTEN ME
STARTED DOING YOGA AND I WAS SO
EAGER TO GET OUT OF IT I CAN'T
EVEN TELL YOU.
>> STEPHEN: TOM BROKAW, WERE
YOU WEARING YOKE YAZ, THE TYPE
THAT ARE SEXY AND TIGHT UP TOP
AND FLARE AT THE KNEE.
IT'S A SEPARATE TRAGEDY I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
>> IT IS A TRAGEDY.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE DOING
YOGA.
>> I GET A CALL.
THEY SAID WE THINK A SMALL PLANE
IS AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.
YOU BETTER GET DOWN HERE.
>> I DRESSED QUICKLY AND WENT
OUT.
IN UPPER MANHATTAN PEOPLE WERE
GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.
HALFWAY DOWNTOWN I WAS LISTENING
TO A WELL KNOWN RADIO REPORTER
HE SAID ANOTHER PLANE FLEW OVER
ME AND IT THREW INTO THE OTHER
TOWER.
I CALLED MY WIFE AND I SAID
WE'RE AT WAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN TALK.
START WATCHING.
THIS I GOT TO THE STUDIO WITH
KATIE AND MATT.
WHEN I PLAYED THE TAPE BACK IN
MY MIND, THERE WAS A SURREAL
QUALITY WITH IT.
IT SEEMED TO UNFOLD IN A SLOMO
WAY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.
WHEN YOU GO TO WAR OR WHEN
HURRICANE EYE SCREEN COMING
ASHORE, YOU HAVE WARNING.
IN THIS CASE IT COMPLETELY
STUNNED ALL OF US.
WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.
I SAID IT TOOK EVERYTHING THAT I
KNEW NOT JUST AS A JOURNALIST
BUT AS A HUSBAND AND AS A
FARTHER AND AS A CITIZEN TO GET
THROUGH THAT DAY.
GOD FORBID IT HAD TO HAPPEN BUT
I WAS AT THAT TIME 61 I THOUGHT
IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYTHING I
KNOW TO TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS
DAY.
I THEN TRIED TO PUT EVERYTHING
THAT WE WERE SEEING IN CONTEXT.
AT ONE POINT I DID SAY WE'RE AT
WAR.
ANOTHER TIME B MIDDAY, I SAID
THIS COUNTRY WILL NOT BE THE
SAME FROM THIS MOMENT ON.
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE US.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE CHANGE THAT HAS HAPPENED
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.
A LOT OF MY AUDIENCE, THEY ARE
NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH DRINK BUT I
THINK SOME OF THEM DO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY DON'T REMEMBER THAT DAY OR
THEY REMEMBER IT FROM THE POINT
OF VIEW OF WATCHING THE OLDER
PEOPLE.
IS AMERICA DIFFERENT?
>> OF COURSE IT IS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THE
BIGGEST CHANGE?
>> WE'RE IN THE TWO LONGEST WARS
IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.
LESS THAN 1% OF THE POP
POPULATION IS TAKING 100% OF
BULLETS IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN: WE'RE ON A WAR ON
TWO FRONTS.
WORLD WAR II WAR ON TWO FRONTS
RED SOX WE BY CHANCE THE
GREATEST GENERATION?
WE DID STEP UP?
>> IT'S A SERIOUS QUESTION.
>> STEPHEN: I KNOW IT IS.
I'M A SERIOUS GUY.
>> I MADE A REMARK TO GENERAL
PATREAUS WHEN I WAS WITH HIM IN
THE EARLY DAYS OF THE IRAQ WAR.
I HAD MET THESE YOUNG PEOPLE.
THEY HAD JUST COME OUT OF
AFGHANISTAN AND IN IRAQ AND THEY
WERE IN TOUGH SHAPE.
I SAID THIS COULD BET NEXT
GREATEST GENERATION.
HE USES THAT PHRASE A LOT.
THE PEOPLE SERVING IN MILITARY
UNIFORM, WHO VOLUNTEERED, WHO
RAISED THEIR HANDS AND SAID I'M
READY TO GO AND A LOT OF THEM
DID AFTER NEN HAVE THAT
POTENTIAL FOR GREATNESS.
THEY'VE COME BACK.
THEY'VE GONE TO SCHOOL.
THEY ARE RUNNING FOR STATE
LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS AND
THE SENATE.
I THINK NOT ENOUGH WAS ASKED OF
THE REST OF US.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE HOSTING A
TWO-HOUR SPECIAL OF DATELINE AT
9:00 P.M.
YOU ARE GOING BACK TO PEOPLE YOU
INTERVIEWED AFTER 9/11th
PEOPLE I CAME TO THEY AND OTHERS
I DIDN'T KNOW.
PEOPLE WHO LINGERED IN MY OWN
MIND.
WHAT CAME -- I WAS WORRIED AT
FIRST.
I DIDN'T WANT TO WADE BACK
THROUGH THE TRAGEDY AND THE
DIFFICULTY OF THAT TIME AND
EVOKE A LOT OF TEARS.
THESE PEOPLE CAME PREPARED TO
GIVE THE COUNTRY A LESSON IN
WHERE WE NEED TO GO NOW.
BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS GREAT
TRAUMA IN THEIR LIVES LOSING A
HUSBAND OR A WIFE OR HAVING
BARELY ESCAPED FROM THE BURNING
TOWERS.
IN EACH CASE OF THE PEOPLE THAT
WE INTERVIEWED, THEY TALKED
ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE DEDICATED
THEIR LIVE IT'S BEING A BETTER
PERSON, THAT THEY HAVE A BETTER
SENSE OF VALUES ABOUT WHAT
REALLY COUNTS FOR THEM.
THEY NEVER STOP THINKING ABOUT
THEIR OFFICE WORKERS WHO DIDN'T
MAKE IT OUT OR THEIR HUSBANDS
WHO DIDN'T GET OUT.
WE HAD PEOPLE WHO -- ACTUALLY A
WIDOW WHEN HAD A HUSBAND ON
FLIGHT 93 THAT WENT DOWN IN
PENNSYLVANIA.
A FRIEND OF HERS SAID TO HER THE
FIRST DAY THIS, IS THE GOING TO
BE THE WORST DAY AND FROM NOW ON
IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER DAY BY
DAY.
SHE SAID THAT HELPED GET ME
THROUGH IT.
METAPHORICALLY WE HAVE TO SPREAD
THAT OUT IN THIS COUNTRY.
IF THEY CAN DO THAT, WHY CAN'T
THE REST OF US FIND A WAY OUT OF
DIFFICULTY WE'RE IN.
WE ARE IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION
RIGHT NOW ECONOMICALLY AND IN
TERMS OF SENSE OF IDENTITY AND
CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS.
>> STEPHEN: TOM, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR COMING.
>> THANK YOU.
>> STEPHEN: TOM B
