NATION, I KEEP MY OPINIONS TO
MYSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
FORTUNATELY MYSELFyMt( IS A HUGE
GOSSIP.
THIS IS TIP OF HAT, WAG OF THE
FINGER.

FOLKS, OUR AIRLINES ARE PLAGUED
WITH PROBLEMS AND NOW THERE'S A
NEW ONE.çó
>> WASHINGTON, D.C., KNOXVILLE,
SEATTLE'S BOEING FIELD, LUBBOCK,
TEXAS AND THE LATEST, RENO'S
AIRPORT HAVE HAD INCIDENTS OF
THE CONTROLLERS ON THE OVERNIGHT
SHIFT FALLING ASLEEP.
>> ANOTHER AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROLLER SUSPENDED FOR -- YOU
GOT IT -- SLEEPING ON THE JOB.
THAT'S SEVEN IN THE LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT,
FOLKS, THINK I WE OWE JOE BIDEN
AN APOLOGY.
HE MUST HAVE BEEN JUST BEEN
LANDING PLANES THE WHOLE TIME.
I'M WAGGING MY FINGER AT THE
F.A.A.
F.A.A. IF YOU EXPECT THE AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS TO STAY
AWAKE FOR EIGHT HOURS IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT STARING AT
THIS BLINKING SCREEN, YOU NEED
TO PUT THEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT
WHERE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FALL
ASLEEP, A COACH SEAT.
TAKE AWAY THEIR LEG ROOM.
GIVE THEM A SEAT THAT WON'T
RECLINE.
PUT THEM NEAR THE BATHROOMS
BETWEEN THE LADY WHO WANTS TO
HELP THEM WITH THEIR CROSS WORD
AND A MOREIDLY OBESE GUY WHO
WON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT MODEL
TRAINS.
THROW IN A CRYING BABY, A
RATTLING CART AND A TEN-YEAR-OLD
PLAYING A VIDEO OF YES DEAR SIX
INCHES FROM THEIR FACE.
THEY'LL STAY AWAKE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
[ APPLAUSE ]
NEXT UP D NEXT UP, NATIONAL
SECURITY IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE,
FOLKS, BUT ACCORDING TO
WIKILEAKS THERE'S A TICKING TIME
BOMB OUT THERE.
>> NEW AND REVEALING SECURITY
DOCUMENTS GIVE US A GLIMPSE OF
THE TERROR SUSPECTS HELD AT
GUANTANAMO BAY.
THEY SAY MANY WERE HELD ON
FLIMSY CHARGES.
TERRORISTS WERE SUPPOSED TO LOOK
FOR INDICATORS LIKE WEARING A
CASIO BRAND WATCH.
>> Stephen: YES, WEARING A
CASIO IS A SURE SIGN SOMEONE NO
LONGER CARES IF THEY LIVE OR
DIE.
AT LEAST 50 DETAINEES WERE
WEARING THEM WHEN THEY GOT TO
GITMO.
I'M SURE IT CAME IN HANDY
BECAUSE THEY ARE WATERPROOF.
I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT FOR
CASIO FOR SCORING SUCH A SWEET
PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS IS A MARKETERS DREAM.
[LAUGHTER]
AL QAEDA HAS SOME OF THE
STRONGEST BRAND RECOGNITION ON
EARTH.
NOW WHEN ANYONE HEARS AL QAEDA
THEY'LL THINK OF CASIO THE WRIST
WATCH OF TERRORISTS.
BRAVO THIS IS THE BIGGEST
MARKETING COUPE SINCE SHRAO *ED
FRUIT OF THE LOOM SIGNED WITH
KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED.
THE LADY LIBERTY STAMP WAS A
SAFE CHOICE BUT IT TURNED OUT TO
ABOUT A GAMBLE.
>> IT WAS A REPLICA VERSION OF
THE NEW YORK NEW YORK CASINO IN
LAS VEGAS, NOT THE ORIGINAL FROM
ELLIS ISLAND.
>> Stephen: FINALLY SOMEONE IS
RECOGNIZING THE TRUE STATUE LADY
HAVINGAS.
NOT THAT OLD HAG FROM FRANCE
THAT STINKS OF IMMIGRANT.
THE POSTAL SERVICE LICENSED THE
PICTURE FROM THE PHOTOHOUSE
GETTY IMAGES WHO HAD IT LISTED
AS LADY LIBERTY.
I APPRECIATE THAT THE POST
OFFICE DIDN'T WASTE TAXPAYER
MONEY BEFORE PRINTING THREE
BILLION OF THEM.
POSTAL SERVICE KEEP UP THE GREAT
WORK.
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOURyM STAMPS
