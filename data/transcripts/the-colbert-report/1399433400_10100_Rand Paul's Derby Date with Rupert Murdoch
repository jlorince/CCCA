THORAX-BEAKING.

AMERICA'S MOST SOUGHT-AFTERBACHELORS, RUPERT MURDOCH.

>> RAND PAUL WAS SEEN WITH MEDIAMOGUL RUPERT MURDOCH AT THE
KENTUCKY DERBY LAST WEEKEND.
>> KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN SENATORRAND PAUL AND MEDIA MAGNATE
RUPERT MURDOCH SPENT THE DAYTOGETHER AT THE KENTUCKY DERBY.
MURDOCH WAS PAUL'S SPECIALGUEST.
THERE'S SPECULATION THE JOINTPERHAPS COULD SIGN A MURDOCH
ENDORSEMENT IF HE RUNS FORPRESIDENT.
>> HE GOT RUPERT MURDOCH TO COMEDOWN TO KENTUCKY.
HE GOT HIM TO SPEND THE DAY WITHHIM, TO GET TO KNOW HIM A
LITTLE.
>> Stephen:  YES, RAND PULLEDOUT ALL THE STOPS TO IMPRESS HIS
DATE, RUPERT MURDOCH, EVENWORE A FESTIVE DERBY HAT MADE OF
THE FINEST GOPHER PELT.
NATION, I LOVE THIS HOT NEWCELEBRITY POWER COUPLE.
I HAVE EVEN GIVEN RUPERT ANDRAND PAUL THEIR OWN FUN
NICKNAME-- RU-PAUL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BUT AS HOT AS THIS DATE WAS,
RAND SHOULD NOT GET TOO ATTACHEDTO RUPY HERE BECAUSE MURDOCH IS
STILL PLAYING THE FIELD.
THERE ARE NEARLY A DOZENREPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS
COURTING HIM ALREADY.
HE'S LIKE A G.O.P. VERSION OFTHE BACHELOR, ESPECIALLY SINCE
THEY ALSO WANT NOTHING TO DOWITH ANYONE NAMED JUAN PABLO.
GOOD LUCK TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUTTHERE.
