(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN)
>> Stephen: OH, THAT'S GREAT.
OH, THAT'S LOVELY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE.
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO SAY, THAT
KIND OF...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT KIND OF CHEERING FOR ME...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLEASE.
OH, PLEASE.
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO SAY, THAT
KIND OF CHEERING FOR ME, THAT'S
REALLY HOW I RELIEVE STRESS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, NATION, I HOPE YOU'RE
SITTING DOWN.
UNLESS YOU'RE GIVING ME A
STANDING OVATION AT HOME, IN
WHICH CASE TAKE YOUR TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
THE REST OF YOU, BRACE YOURSELF,
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT NEWT GINGRICH
POSTED THIS ON FACEBOOK.
"BE SURE TO WATCH HANNITY THIS
WEDNESDAY AT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN,
I WILL BE ON TO TALK ABOUT MY
RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES."
THIS IS HUGE NEWS!
(LAUGHTER)
HUGE-HEADED NEWS!
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE, FOLKS, CLEARLY AFTER
MONTHS OF SPECULATION, NEWT
GINGRICH HAS FINALLY ANNOUNCED
THAT TOMORROW HE WILL BE MAKING
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS THE PREANNOUNCEMENT
ANNOUNCEMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN
PRE-WAITING FOR.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS EXCITED
SINCE MARCH WHEN NEWT MADE THE
PRE-PREANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE
WOULD BE ENTERING AN EXPLORATORY
PHASE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH I BELIEVE MEANS THAT HE
AND HIS CANDIDACY HAVE AGREED TO
AN OPEN MARRIAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, NEWT ISN'T THE ONLY
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO'S
THROWING HIS OVERSIZED HAT INTO
THE RING WHERE HE WILL THEN PICK
IT UP AND THROW IT INTO ANOTHER
MORE IMPORTANT RING.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IS DONALD TRUMP WHO... FOLKS,
HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN HE
THROWS HIS HAT SO HIS HAIR
DOESN'T GO WITH IT.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP HAS ANNOUNCED THAT ON THE
SEASON FINALE OF "CELEBRITY
APPRENTICE" HE MAY ANNOUNCE A
FUTURE PRESS CONFERENCE TO
ANNOUNCE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
OH, THE RARE ANNOUNCEMENT
ANNOUNCEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S ONE MORE LEVEL OF
ANNOUNCEMENT THAN NEWT'S
ANNOUNCEMENT-ANNOUNCEMENT.
AND, FOLKS, THERE IS LITTLE
DOUBT WHAT TRUMP'S EVENTUAL
ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE BECAUSE
HE'S ALREADY DECIDED TO RUN-- IN
HIS MIND.
(LAUGHTER)
IN HIS MIND!
THAT MEANS HE'S A SHOE-IN,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL HIS
SUPPORTERS ARE.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, TRUMP, TRUMP!
TRUMP!
