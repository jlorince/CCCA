(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR
OF A NEW BOOK TITLED "THE WORLD
AMERICA MADE."
ALTHOUGH FOR TECH SUPPORT YOU'RE
GOING TO WANT TO CALL INDIA.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT KAGAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY MR. KAGAN!
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: MAN, I AM SO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE ON THIS SHOW BECAUSE
YOU'RE A NEOCON, RIGHTING?
>> I GUESS, THAT'S WHAT THEY
TELL ME.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THEY
TOLD ME ABOUT YOU, TOO.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: I MISS YOU GUYS
BECAUSE BACK IN THE EARLY... THE
EARLY 2000s DURING THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION YOU GUYS WERE
LIKE THE CABBAGE PATCH KIDS, THE
TICKLE ME ELMO.
EVERYONE HAD TO HAVE A NEOCON ON
THEIR TEAM.
IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A
COLLECTOR'S ITEM NOW.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A WHOLE
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
YOU'RE SENIOR FELLOW AT THE
BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, A
"WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNIST IN.
I'M SURPRISEDDED THAT LIBERAL
RAG LETS YOU WRITE OVER THERE.
YOU'RE A FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR
TO MITT ROMNEY.
IS THAT AS SEXY AS IT SOUNDS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M VERY HONORED TO BE ABLE
TO WORK AND HELP THE GOVERNOR
ANY WAY I CAN.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ONE OF 24
GUYS ADVISING HIM ON FOREIGN
POLICY.
>> AT LEAST.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE THE
BEST ONE, RIGHT?
>> I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE CASE,
NO.
>> Stephen: COME ON!
COME ON!
ALL RIGHT YOU'VE GOT A BOOK
CALLED "THE WORLD AMERICA MADE."
WHAT IS THE WORLD AMERICA MADE?
>> WELL, IT'S THE WORLD ORDER
THAT WAS THE UNITED STATES WITH
ITS INFLUENCE AFTER WORLD WAR II
CREATED.
IT'S A LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMIC ORDER OF FREE AND OPEN
MARKETS.
IT'S A WORLD INCREASINGLY
DEMOCRATIC.
BEFORE WORLD WAR I THERE ARE TEN
DEMOCRACIES IN THE WORLD.
TODAY THERE ARE 115.
>> Stephen: WE DID THAT.
>> WE DID DO THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: APPLAUDING FOR THE
UNITED STATES.
NICE THING TO DO.
NOW THERE WERE TEN DEMOCRACIES
BEFORE THE WAR, THERE ARE 115
NOW.
DO WE GET A PIECE OF THAT
ACTION?
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE ROYALTIES OR ANYTHING?
BECAUSE IT'S OUR IDEA.
>> WE DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM IT.
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE ARE
A GREAT BENEFICIARY OF IT.
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
GOING TO WAR WITH DEMOCRACIES,
DEMOCRACIES ARE CLOSE ALLIES,
THEY SHARE OUR VALUES AND THEY
ARE GENERALLY VERY SUCCESSFUL
ECONOMICALLY AND HELP US IN THAT
REGARD.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE IN FAVOR
OF THE WAR IN IRAQ, RIGHT?
>> I WAS, AS WERE MANY PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: RIGHT UP HERE, BAN
BY DOLL.
HOW ABOUT IRAN?
DO WE GO IN THERE OR LET THE
ISRAELIS HAND THAT WILL ONE?
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO LET THE
ISRAELIS HANDLE THAT.
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE
CAPACITY TO DO IT.
>> Stephen: DO NOT COUNT OUT
MY JEWISH FRIENDS.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY ARE VERY CARABLE PEOPLE.
DO NOT CROSS THEM.
>> OKAY, WELL, THEY HAVE LIMITED
MILITARY CAPACITY TO DO THAT
PARTICULAR JOB.
BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW IRAN IS
ISOLATED.
>> Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO USE
OUR MILITARY POWER TO KEEP THEM
FROM GETTING A BOMB.
YES OR NO?
>> I THINK IT COULD WELCOME TO
COME TO THAT.
>> Stephen: COULD WELL?
GROW A PAIR!
>> (LAUGHS).
>> Stephen: DO WE GO IN?
THIS AIN'T TIDDLEDY WINKS, THIS
IS NUCLEAR TIDDLEDY WINKS.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE
SANCTIONS WILL WORK IN GETS THEM
TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS BEFORE WE
ARRIVE AT THAT DECISION.
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED AFFAIR.
>> Stephen: WE CAN'T HAVE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE MIDDLE
EAST, RIGHT?
>> WELL, THERE ARE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> Stephen: NO THERE ARE NOT.
WHERE?
>> WELL, I'M TOLD THAT ISRAEL
HAS...
>> Stephen: SHH!
I CAN NAY!
ON THE OMB-AY.
THAT'S THE ONLY HEBREW I KNOW.
>> IMPRESSIVE.
>> Stephen: IS THE YOUTH OF
MILITARY POWER IN AN ELECTED
WAY, IS THAT A FOREIGN POLICY
TOOL OR IS THAT A FOREIGN POLICY
FAILURE?
>> SOMETIMES IT'S A FAILURE AND
SOMETIMES IT'S A TOOL.
I THINK WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH
WILL IT'S QADDAFI, THE THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED TO USE
MILITARY FORCE TO DESTROY
QADDAFI BECAUSE HE WAS ABOUT TO
KILL TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT
MORE PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GIVING
CREDIT TO OBAMA FOR ANYTHING
VERY R YOU?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: HOW CAN YOU ADVISE
ROMNEY AND LIKE ANYTHING OBAMA
DID?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK WHEN THE PRESIDENT
DOES THE RIGHT THING IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT PARTY YOU'RE IN.
>> Stephen: BUT THE PRESIDENT
HAS DONE NOTHING RIGHT IN
FOREIGN POLICY, OKAY?
(LAUGHTER)
BIN LADEN?
DOESN'T COUNT.
(LAUGHTER)
KILLING AL-AWLAKI DOESN'T COUNT.
QADDAFI DOESN'T COUNT.
SUPPORTING THE ARAB SPRING
DOESN'T COUNT.
SO WHAT ELSE HAS HE DONE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HE'S DONE SOME THINGS WRONG
H. HE HAS A GOOD POLICY IN AREA,
PARTICULARLY IN DEALING WITH
CHINA.
I THINK HE'S STRENGTHENED OUR
POSITION IN ASIA WITH OUR
ALLIES.
ON SOME ISSUES HE'S BEEN A LOT
WEAKER.
ON IRAN I THINK HE WILL BE
JUDGED ULTIMATELY BY WHAT
HAPPENS WITH IRAN.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES AND MONOMONACO
NOW?
>> AFTER THE BEATDOWN?
>> AFTER THE BEAT DONE THAT HOCK
GAVE TO PRINCESS WHAT'S HIS
PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS ABOUT BEING A STRONG
POWER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MONACO CAN DO
ABOUT IT.
>> Stephen: DO THEY HAVE
NUKES?
>> NOT THAT THEY'VE
ACKNOWLEDGED.
>> Stephen: MUCH LIKE ISRAEL.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ROBERT KAGAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BOOK IS "THE WORLD AMERICA
MADE."
YOU'RE WELCOME, WORLD.
WE MADE YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
