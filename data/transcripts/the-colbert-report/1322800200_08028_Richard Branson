>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
BRITISH ENTREPRENEUR AND
BILLIONAIRE, YEAH, BUT
THAT'S IN METRIC.
PLEASE WELCOME SIR RICHARD
BRANSON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SIR RICHARD, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
HOW ARE YOU.
>> I'M VERY WELL.
>> Stephen: NOW, I-- I-- ARE
YOU EXPECTING A FIRE?
SIR RICHARD, WHY WOULD YOU
HAVE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
>> I THOUGHT IF THE
INTERVIEW IS A GOOD INTERVOW
AND THE AUDIENCE THINK IT
WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW, THUMBS
UP AND I WALK OFF.
AND IF IT THEY FEEL IT IS A
BAD INTERVIEW, THUMBS DOWN.
WE WILL DECIDE AT THE END,
ANYWAY.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND SO,
THUMBS DOWN, DOW WHAT, YOU
SET ME ON FIRE AND THEN PUT
IT OUT?
>> WELL, RECEIPTS'S COME TO
THAT DEPENDING-- .
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOUR NEW BOOK IS YOU WILL
CAD SCREW BUSINESS AS USUAL,
ALL RIGHT.
YOUR PREVIOUS BOOKS HAVE
BEEN CALLED LOSING MY
VIRGINITY, BUSINESS STRIPPED
BAYER, SCREW IT LET'S DO IT
WHEN ARE YOU JUST GOING TO
NAME A BOOK DOUBLE ENTENDRE
FOR [BLEEP].
CUT TO THE CHASE
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IF YOU HAVEN'T PATENTED
THAT, I THINK I MIGHT USE IT
FOR MY NEXT BOOK.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO SCREW BUSINESS AS
USUAL.
YOU ARE A BUSINESSMAN.
WHY SHAKE UP THE GAME THAT
YOU ARE ALREADY WINNING?
>> BUSINESS CAN BE A FORCE
FOR GOOD, BASICALLY.
>> Stephen: A FORCE FOR GOOD,
IT'S A FORCE FOR PROFIT, A
FORCE FOR PROFIT, PROFIT IS
IN AND OF ITSELF IS A GOOD
THING.
JUST MAKING A PROFIT SAY
GOOD THING.
>> MAKING A PROFIT SAY GOOD
THING.
EMPLOYING PEOPLE SAY GOOD
THING.
MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN
PEOPLE'S LIVES BY YOU KNOW,
CREATING BETTER AIRLINES OR
CREATING GREAT SPACESHIP --
IS A GOOD THING.
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF EVERY
SINGLE BUSINESSPERSON COULD
ALSO TRY TO SORT OUT SOME OF
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD,
WE WOULD GET ON TOP OF A LOT
OF THESE PROBLEMS.
BECAUSE BUSINESS LEADERS ARE
ENTREPRENEURIAL AND THEY
KNOW HOW TO SEE PROBLEMS.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE GOOD
THINGS THINGS SHOULD BE
TACKLES THAT AREN'T GOING TO
BE SOLVED ANY OTHER WAY.
>> LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
GLOBAL WARMING WHICH
HAS-- YOU DON'T BELIEVE
EXISTS-- WHICH I SUSPECT YOU
DON'T BELIEVE EXISTS.
>> Stephen: YOUR SUSPICIONS
ARE CORRECT.
>> ARE YOU QUITE THE
DIRECTIVE.
>> IF YOU, I THINK THE
BUSINESS COMMUNITY SINCE
POLITICIANS ARE NOT SORTING
OUT THE PROBLEM, I THINK THE
BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAN BY
TRYING TO GET THE 25
GIGATONS OF CARBON OUT OF
THE ATMOSPHERE.
>> Stephen: HAVEN'T THE
MARKET SPOKEN, THAT GIGATONS
OF CARBON IS UP THERE
BECAUSE OF BUSINESS, WE BUY
CARS, OIL, COAL.
WE BURN THEM, ITS CARBON
GOES UP, MONEY MADE THAT
HAPPEN.
THE FREE MARKET SAYS THAT
GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT BAD,
IT SAYS IT'S GOOD.
>> YEAH, BUT IF IT'S GOING
TO FRY OUR GRANDCHILDREN
IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD.
>> Stephen: MAYBE OUR
GRANDCHILDREN AREN'T THAT
NICE.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
I MEAN AT VIRGIN ALL THE
PROFITS WE MAKE FROM OUR
AIRLINE BUSINESSES WE HAVE
INVESTED IN CLEAN FUELS.
SO AND I THINK BY, WITHIN
THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE WILL
BE FLYING ALL OTHER PLANES
ON FUELS THAT ARE NOT
DAMAGING THE ENVIRONMENT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO
PUT CLEAN FUELS, BIOFUELS?
IN AIRPLANES?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THERE ARE DIFFERENT
COMPANY DOESING DIFFERENT
THINGS.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT MY
PLANE, AIR COLBERT.
>> YOUR PLANE WILL RUN ON
DIRTY FUEL BUT ALL THE OTHER
PLANES.
>> Stephen: MY LADY LIKES IT
DIRTY.
SIR, SIR, YOU ARE STILL SIR,
RIGHT?
>> MAYBE UNTIL THE END OF
THE SHOW.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
ARE YOU PART OF THE 1% OF
THE 1%.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
OCCUPY WALL STREET CLOWNS
DOWN THERE?
>> I THINK THEY HAVE A VALID
POINT WHICH IS ANOTHER
REASON WHY I THINK BUSINESS
NEEDS TO GET ITS ACT
TOGETHER AND SHOULD GET ITS
ACT TOGETHER.
AND GET OUT THERE AND DO
SOMETHING POSITIVE.
YOU KNOW, SO WE SET UP AN
ORGANIZATION CALLED THE
ELDERS WHICH TRY TO RESOLVE
CONFLICTS IN THE WORLD.
>> THE ELDERS.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
THE LEADERS OF A CULT.
YOU WOULD BE A GREAT CULT
LEADER, BY THE WAY, THAT
HAIR AND WHATEVER THIS IS,
YOU ABSOLUTELY, PEOPLE WOULD
DEFINITELY, I COULD SEE YOU
WITH CHILD BRIDES.
A COMPOUND IN IDAHO OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
>> VIRGIN CHILD BRIDES.
>> Stephen: GOD, I HOPE SO
GOD I HOPE SO, SIR.
YOU SAID CAPITAL CIVIL THE
ONLY SYSTEM THAT WORKS BUT
IT ALSO CREATES EXTREME
WEALTH FOR JUST A FEW
INDIVIDUALS.
SO WHEN ARE YOU GIVING YOUR
EXTREME WEALTH AWAY.
BECAUSE I WILL TAKE A
HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT NOW F
YOU BROUGHT YOUR CHECKBOOK.
>> NO I THINK THAT WHAT
CAPITALISM IS THE ONLY
SYSTEM THAT WORKS.
IT DOES BRING EXTREME WEALTH
AND THEREFORE IT BRINGS
EXTREME RESPONSIBILITY.
THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS
IN THE WORLD AS YOU KNOW AND
I THINK WITH ENOUGH
DETERMINATION WE CAN GET ON
TOP OF THESE PROBLEMS AND WE
SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT TO THE
POLITICIANS.
>> BUT WHY DOW WANT TO SAVE
THE WORLD.
YOU HAVE A SPACESHIP, YOU
CAN LEAVE ANY TIME YOU WANT.
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: THE NEXT BOOK
SHOULD BE THROUGH-- SCREW
THE WORLD I'M OUT OF HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR
RICHARD.
>> I THOUGHT HE WAS QUITE
NICE BUT --
>> STEVE BE, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
