>> Stephen: HI, WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
WITH FEMINISM IN THE 1960'S.
IN HER HONOR, I DIDN'T SHAVE MY
ARMPITS.
PLEASE WELCOME STEPHANIE COONTZ.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON
YOUR NEW BOOK SAY STRANGE
STIRRING.
I HAVE THE COPY OF THIS FEMININE
MISS STEEK.
TELL ME MYSTIQUE.
TELL ME WHY THIS WAS SO
IMPORTANT AND HOW IT DESTROYED
THE AMERICAN FAMILY UNIT.
DID IT RIGHT?
BACK THEN -- I BELIEVE WOMEN
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT.
BUT BACK THEN THERE WAS ORDER.
MAN WORKED.
WOMEN AT HOME.
HAPPY.
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF ORDER.
THEY HAD MASTER LAW -- HEAD AND
MASTER LAWS IN MARRIAGE THAT
SAID THAT THE MAN HAD THE RIGHT
TO DECIDE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE
MARRIAGE, WHERE THEY LIVED.
IF A MAN MOVED AWAY AND THE WIFE
REFUSED TO FOLLOW HE COULD
CHARGE HER WITH DESERTION AND
GET A FAULT-BASED DIVORCE.
YEAH, MEN WERE IN CHARGE.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
THIS BOOK DAD DIDN'T WANT MOM TO
SEE?
>> THAT IS WHAT IS STUNNING.
WHEN SHE FIRST PUBLISHED THE
ARTICLE IN A BOOK SHE HAD THIS
RADICAL TITLE.
SHE SAID "I SAY, WOMEN ARE
PEOPLE, TOO."
IT WAS SUCH A RADICAL STATEMENT
BECAUSE WOMEN WERE TOLD ALL YOU
ARE IS SOMEBODY'S KEEPER.
>> Steve: ARE YOU SAYING
BEFORE SHE SAID THAT THAT MEN
WERE ENGAGING IN BESTIALITY?
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO.
>> Stephen: LET ME GO TO THE
OPENING CHAPTER HERE.
CHAPTER 1:  THE PROBLEM THAT HAS
NO NAME.
THE PROBLEM LAY BURIED UNSPOKEN
FOR MANY YEARS IN THE MIND OF
AMERICAN WOMEN.
IT WAS A STRANGE STIRRING, A
SENSE OF DISSATISFACTION, A
YEARNING WOMEN SUFFERED WITH.
EACH WIFE STRUGGLED ALL ALONG AS
SHE MADE THE BED, ATE PEANUT
BUTTER SANDWICHES WITH HER
CHILDREN, LAID BESIDE HER
HUSBAND AT NIGHT.
SHE WAS AFRAID TO ASK EVEN OF
HERSELF THE SILENT QUESTION:  IS
THIS ALL.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS PROBLEM.
A REAL PROBLEM IS:  IS THERE ANY
FOOD?
WHAT ARE THESE -- SO MANY PEOPLE
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW NAME OR NO NAME.
>> IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE.
>> Stephen: I JUST READ IT.
I JUST READ IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> LET ME FINISH, STEPHEN.
WOMEN IN THOSE DAYS -- THIS
WASN'T A BOOK THAT APPEALED TO
MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN WHO WERE WELL
AWARE THEY HAD PRIVILEGES.
THEY HAD GONE THROUGH THE
DEPRESSION, WORLD WAR II.
THEY HAD THINGS BETTER THAN
THEIR MOTHER DID.
ONE WOMAN SAID THERE WERE KNEE
GROWS BEING BEATEN DOWN SOUTH.
>> Stephen: THEY PREFER TO BE
CALLED COLOREDS.
>> SHE WAS TALKING IN THE 60s.
THEY SAID THERE WERE KIDS IN
APPALACHIAN WITH BELLIES SWOLLEN
WITH HUNGER BUT WHAT RIGHT DID I
HAVE TO FEEL MISERABLE?
WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE THEY DON'T
HAVE A RIGHT TO FEEL MISERABLE
THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM FEEL
BETTER.
>> Stephen: HOW WAS THIS
PROBLEM DIAGNOSED AT THE TIME?
>> THE PHYSICIAN CALLED IT HOUSE
WIFE SYNDROME.
EVERY WOMAN I TALKED TO SAID SHE
THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE CRAZY.
A PSYCHOLOGIST SAID YOU ARE
PROBABLY SUFFERING FROM PENIS
ENVY AND YOU NEED --
>> Stephen: PENIS ENVY?
GET IN LINE?
YOU THINK MEN DON'T SUFFER FROM
THAT?
>> I THINK THEY PROBABLY DO.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE
PROBLEM NOW?
YOU CALL SOMETHING THE HOTTY
MYSTIQUE.
>> THERE'S A COUPLE THAT HAVE
REPLACED --
>> Stephen: I'M SPECIFICKY
INTERESTED IN THE HOTTIE
MYSTIQUE.
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GRABS ME.
>> THAT'S THE IDEA THAT YOU USED
TO -- IT USED TO BE THAT A WOMAN
WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SMART AS
A MAN.
SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO BE GOOD AT
SPORTS.
SHE SUPPOSED TO LET HIM WIN.
NOW WE TELL WOMEN YOU CAN DO ALL
OF THAT AS LONG AS YOU ARE
GORGEOUS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
AND DISPLAY YOUR SEXUALITY.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE
PROBLEM?
>> WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
>> Stephen: YOU ARE ALL DOLLED
UP TONIGHT.
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU PROVED
IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE
EVERYTHING.
>> I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE
FLATTERED BY THAT AND NOT TO
HAVE MY HEAD TURNED BY IT.
WE KNOW THAT THE BEST PREDICTORS
OF A HAPPINESS IN A MAN AS
RELATIONSHIP IS HOW MUCH SEX HE
GETS AND A WOMAN SEAS HOW MUCH
HORSEWORK SHE DOES.
SKIP YOUR PORNOGRAPHY.
WE HAVE A WORD FOR IT CHORENOGR
CHORENOGRAPHY.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY THE
HAPPIEST MAN IS THE ONE WHO GETS
THE LEAST CRITICISM AND MOST
SEX.
I WOULD SATE HAPPYIEST MAN GETS
THE
