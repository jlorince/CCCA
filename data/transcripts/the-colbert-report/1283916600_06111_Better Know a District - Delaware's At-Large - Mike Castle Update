NATION, YESTERDAY... THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YESTERDAY
WAS LABOR DAY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS.
TIME TO PUT AWAY THE WHITE PANTS
AND DUST OFF THE WHITE
POLITICIANS.
YES, LABOR DAY IS THE CUSTOMARY
KICKOFF OF ESEASON, AND THIS
YEAR'S MID-TERMS ARE HEATING UP
LIKE A KORAN AT A FLORIDA CHURCH
RALLY.
THIS FALL REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FACING
TOUGH CHALLENGES FROM TEA PARTY
INSURGENTS.
JUST LAST WEEK IN ALASKA,
REPUBLICAN SITTING SENATOR LISA
MURKOWSKI LOST IN A PRIMARY
CHALLENGE TO TEA PARTY CANDIDATE
JOE MILLER SEEN HERE AS HIS HOBO
CHARACTER LUCKY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, MILLER IMMEDIATELY
DELIVERED ON HIS CAMPAIGN
PROMISE TO GET INTO A THREE-CAR
ACCIDENT.
THE NEXT TEA PARTY TARGET IS
DELAWARE G.O.P. SENATORIAL
CANDIDATE AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW
CONGRESSMAN MIKE CASTLE, WHO
WILL BE FACING TEA PARTY
CHALLENGER CHRISTINE O'DONNELL,
A FAR RIGHT CONSERVATIVE WHO
LOST TO JOE BIDEN IN 2008 AND IS
A VOCAL PROMOTOR OF CHASTITY.
PROVING ONCE AGAIN THAT NOTHING
MAKES YOU WANT TO DO IT LESS
THAN DEBATING JOE BIDEN.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK.
I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
THANK YOU.
NOW, IT'S A TIGHT RACE, BUT WE
AT "THE REPORT" STAND BY OUR
FRIENDS.
TO GIVE CONGRESSMAN CASTLE THE
COLBERT BUMP HEADING INTO NEXT
TUESDAY'S PRIMARY, I AM PROUD TO
PRESENT AN ENCORE PRESENTATION
OF MY EXCLUSIVE PROFILE FROM
LAST FALL.
CONGRESSMAN, CASTLE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: I AM SURPRISED
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TALK TO
ME BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI TOLD ALL
DEMOCRATS NOT TO GO ON "THE
COLBERT REPORT."
SO ISN'T THIS A LITTLE BIT OF A,
SKEW YOU, NANCY.
I'M GOING ON ANYWAY.
>> WELL, I'M A REPUBLICAN FOR
STARTERS.
>> Stephen: YOU SUPPORT
ABORTION RIGHTS AND GUN CONTROL.
>> I ALSO FOUGHT FOR A BALANCED
BUDGET TO REDUCE SPENDING TO,
SUPPORT OUR MILITARY.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE A MODERATE NORTHEAST
REPUBLICAN?
>> I AM SAYING, THAT YES.
THERE'S IN THE A LOT AROUND.
>> Stephen: NO, THIS IS LIKE
INTERVIEWING A PANDA.
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU STOP ASKING
DELAWARE, CONGRESSMAN, AND START
ASKING DELA-WHY?
>> I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT
WAY EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: TAKE A MINUTE.
>> BUT DELA-WHY IS A GOOD
QUESTION.
WHEN IN DELAWARE ARE THE
FIGHTING BLUE HENS.
THE BLUE HENS GO BACK TO THE
REVOLUTIONARY WAR WHEN THEY TOOK
THEIR FIGHTING COCKS WITH THEM
WHEN THEY WENT OFF TO WAR WITH
THE TROOPS.
>> Stephen: DELAWARE STILL
HAVE SOME FIGHTING COCKS.
>> THERE ARE SOME FIGHTING
COCKS.
IT IS ILLEGAL IN DELAWARE AS IT
IS IN ALMOST EVERY STATE.
>> Stephen: NOW, I'M SOMETHING
OF A COCKEN NEWS YAS, ARE YOU?
>> NOT REALLY, NO.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT.
OKAY.
>> IT'S PART OF THE HISTORY OF
DELAWARE, BUT I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN BRINGING IT BACK.
>> Stephen: YOUR TEAM IS
CALLED THE BLUE HENS.
>> WE FIGHT HARD.
>> Stephen: SO WILL YOU MAKE
COCKFIGHTING THE OFFICIAL STATE
SPORT OF DELAWARE?
>>LY NOT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE GOING
TO COCK BLOCK DELAWARE?
>> I AM GOING TO COCK BLOCK
DELAWARE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT ABOUT GUNS?
>> I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME
GUN CONTROL.
>> Stephen: CONGRESS SHALL
MAKE NO LAW, SIR.
>> PEOPLE WHO HAVE CRIMINAL
BACKGROUNDS OR MENTAL ILLNESS
BACKGROUNDS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE
TO ACQUIRE GUNS.
>> Stephen: CRAZY PEOPLE ARE
STILL AMERICANS.
>> BUT THEY SHOULD NOT
NECESSARILY HAVE GUNS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S INFRINGING.
>> IT'S NOT INFRINGING.
IT'S SAYING PEOPLE WHO COULD BE
A HARM TO OUR SOCIETY SHOULD NOT
HAVE GUNS.
STEEP STOP THAT'S SHOCKING IN
THIS DAY AND AGE THAT SOMEONE
COULD BE SO PREJUDICE AGAINST
PEOPLE WHO ARE VIOLENTLY INSANE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'RE SAYING THE VIOLENTLY
INSANE SHOULD NOT HAVE GUNS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO BE
ELECTED AS A REPUBLICAN?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Stephen: GOOD LUCK.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: MOVE ON.
DID YOU VOTE AGAINST THE
CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON GAY
MARRIAGE.
>> YES.
I THINK THAT MARRIAGE IS A STATE
DECISION.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A FEDERAL
DECISION.
>> Stephen: CAN I ESTABLISH A
CIVIL UNION BETWEEN ME AND
ANOTHER MAN?
>> IF YOUR STATE ALLOWS YOU TO
DO SO.
>> Stephen: MY STATE DOES
ALLOW ME TO DO SO.
>> THEN YOU MAY IF YOU WISH.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ME AND
A CHICKEN?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHY?
>> A CHICKEN IS NOT A HUMAN
BEING.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU WON'T
ALLOW COCKFIGHTING.
WHY CAN'T I MAR RAY CHICKEN IF I
CHOOSE SO?
>> IN MY STATE.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T BELIEVE
DELAWARE SHOULD NOT ALLOW PEOPLE
TO MARRY CHICKENS.
>> YOU'RE THE BLUE HENS.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE BURNING
BRIDGES INNER DIRECTION.
>> WE DON'T BELIEVE IN
BEASTALTY.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN DELAWARE.
>> Stephen: WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT BEASTALTY.
>> A MARRIAGE WITH A CHICKEN.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE IMPLYING
I'M GOING TO CONSUMMATE MY
MARRIAGE.
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHICKEN
WOULD BE SEPARATE.
SEPARATE BUT EQUAL.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IF I'M DYING OR MY CHICKEN IS
DYING, WE CAN'T VISIT EACH OTHER
IN THE HOSPITAL.
[LAUGHTER]
I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU
RETHINK YOUR MARRIAGE WITH THE
CHICKEN.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU BY ANY
CHANCE RETHINKING THIS
INTERVIEW?
>> I AM, YEAH.
I'M RETHINKING THE INTERVIEW FOR
SURE.
>> Stephen: CONGRESSMAN, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
