RAGES ON TO THIS DAY.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THIS ELECTION, THIS ELECTION REALLY IS ALL ABOUT POLICY.
WHETHER IT BE THE ECONOMY,
IMMIGRATION, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, WOMEN'S RIGHTS DO.
WE WANT THE FAILED IDEAS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS OR THE MYSTERY PRIZE INSIDE THE HANDSOME BOX.
NOW FOLKS,--  (LAUGHTER) WHAT COULD IT BE?
THIS STARK CHOICE GOES BEYOND THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
CONTROL OF THE SENATE IS ALSO UP FOR GRABS.
SO SENATE CANDIDATES ARE ADDRESSING WHAT MANY VOTERS ARE SAYING, HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP HOLDING ELECTIONS.
OF COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT REPEALING THE 17th AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFIES THAT THERE
BE TWO SENATORS FROM EACH STATE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THEREOF.
IT IS THE CONSTITUTION HE BIGGEST MISTAKE IF THEY DON'T COUNT THE TYPO IN THE
FIRST DRAFT THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE TRIAL BY JERRY.
(LAUGHTER) IT WAS FIRM BUT HE WAS FAIR.
NOW THIS REPEAL OF THE 17th AMENDMENT IS BEING SPEARHEADED BY REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL CANDIDATES LIKE
MICHIGAN PETE HOEKSTRA, TODD AIKEN AND INDIANA RICHARD MOORE DOCK WITHOUT WANT TO
GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN SENATORS WERE APPOINTED BY STATE LEGISLATURES, A
PROCESS THE SENATE'S OWN ONE SITE SAYS WAS MARKED BY DEADLOCK, INTIMIDATION AND BRIBERY.
IN OTHER WORDS, EXACTLY AS IT IS NOW MINUS ALL THAT STUPID VOTING.
I MEAN AFTER ALL, WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO VOTE FOR MY SENATOR.
I ALREADY VOTED FOR MY STATE SENATOR.
HE KNOWS WHAT I LIKE.
LET HIM ORDER FOR ME IT MAKES ME FEEL PATCH ERRED.
YOU KNOW, ORDER ME SOMETHING NICE.
BUT REMEMBER, I'M ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH AND BLACK PEOPLE.
NOW DECIDES--  (LAUGHTER)
>> THE FOUNDERS OF IN COUNTRY MEANT THE SENATE TO HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY.
AS MOORE DOCK EXPLAINED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS THERE TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.
THE SENATE WAS THERE TO REPRESENT THE STATE.
YES.
THE STATES NEED THEIR OWN CHAMBER OF CONGRESS WHERE THEY WON'T BE BULLIED BY THE
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEM.
I MEAN THE PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.
WHY DO YOU THINK FLORIDA IS SO SCREWED UP.
IT'S FULL OF FLORIDIANS.
(LAUGHTER) WE NEED-- WE NEED TO PUT THE CHOICE OF SENATORS IN THE CAPABLE HANDS OF OUR STATE LAWMAKERS.
I MEAN WE KNOW WHAT CLOSE ATTENTION WE ALL PAY WHEN WE ELECT THOSE GUYS.
I DO VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE I'M CHOOSING THE ONE WITH THE
FUNNIEST SOUNDING NAME.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK WITH A THISTLEBOTTOM WHEN THERE IS A DONEWORTH ON THE BALLOT.
THAT IS JUST THROWING AWAY YOUR VOTE.
THE POINT IS THESE CANDIDATES ARE BEING REFRESHINGLY HONEST WHEN THEY SAY THAT VOTERS CANNOT
BE TRUSTED TO CHOOSE THEIR SENATOR.
AND IF WE ELECT THEM WE'LL PROVE THEM RIGHT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
