GINGRICH!
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, THEY SAY EVERY TIME GOD
CLOSES A DOOR HE OPENS A WINDOW.
THAT'S WHY HEAVEN HAS SUCH HUGE
AIR CONDITIONING BILLS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS YAHWEH OR NO WAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M THE
MOST FAMOUS CATHOLIC ON
TELEVISION.
I'M THE ONLY ONE IN LATE NIGHT
WITH HIS OWN CHECKLIST.
I AM BASICALLY THE POPE OF BASIC
CABLE.
SO WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH, EVERYONE IS
WAITING FOR MY IMPRAY MA TOUR,
MY SAT SAT, MY MY DOGGO DOGGARE
PUPSI BITE'EM.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, ON SUNDAY THE HOLY ROMAN
CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE ONE TRUE
BRIDE OF CHRIST TURNED INTO A
GIRL GONE WILD.
>> CATHOLICS PROBABLY NOTICED
CHANGES DURING MASS.
THE CHURCH IS USING AN ENGLISH
TRANSLATION OF THE RITUAL TEXT
USED FOR CELEBRATING MASS.
>> YES, THEY CHANGED THE WORDS
TO THE MASS.
THEY PUT THE NEW WORDS ON THIS
LITTLE CARD RIGHT HERE.
CAUGHT ME BY TOTAL SURPRISE!
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS NOT KNOWN
FOR CHANGING ITS POSITION--
MISSIONARY, BY THE WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE QUESTION IS ARE THESE
CHANGES TO THE MASS WHAT GOD
WANTS?
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
NO WAY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LISTEN UP... LISTEN UP, CATHOLIC
CHURCH.
DO NOTES ME WITH THE LITURGY.
IT IS THE INFALLIBLE WORD OF GOD
WHICH WAS TRANSLATED FROM THE
LATIN WHICH WAS TRANSLATED FROM
THE GREEK WHICH WAS TRANSLATED
FROM THE ARAMAIC WHICH, OF
COURSE, WAS TRANSLATED FROM THE
ORIGINAL ENGLISH.
(LAUGHTER)
BESIDES, DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT
TOOK KNOW MEMORIZE ALL THESE
PRAYERS?
IT WAS HARDER THAN MEMORIZING
"WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE."
(LAUGHTER)
"OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN,
HALLOWED BE THY NAME.
THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BEEN
B DONE, ION SOMETIME, JAMES
DEAN, BROOKLYN'S GOT A WINNING
TEAM, DAVY CROCKETT BUSINESSNY
LAND ELVIS PRESLEY DISNEYLAND."
AMEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND CHECK THIS OUT.
GET ALOAD OF THESE SO-CALLED
IMPROVEMENTS.
THE NEW NICENE CREED.
THE 1700-YEAR-OLD PROFESSION OF
WHAT ALL CATHOLICS MUST BELIEVE
HAS BEEN TWEAKED.
IT NOW DESCRIBES JESUS NOT AS
THE UNDERSTANDABLE ONE IN BEING
WITH THE FATHER BUT AS CON
CONSUBSTANTIAL WITH THE FATHER.
REALLY?
CONSUBSTANTIAL?
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
(LAUGHTER)
WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO HEAVEN
HERE, NOT TAKE THE S.A.T.s!
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOR THE RECORD...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND FOR THE RECORD, CON
CONSUBSTANTIAL IS NOW ISTANBUL.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, I DON'T THINK I'M
OVERSTATING IT.
I DON'T THINK I'M OVERSTATING IT
WHEN I SAY THIS IS THE
SINGLE-BIGGEST SCANDAL EVER TO
HIT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
(LAUGHTER)
I CERTAINLY REFUSE TO THINK OF
ANOTHER.
(LAUGHTER)
WORST OF ALL, WITH THESE WEIRD
NEW CHANGES, NOW WHEN I'M IT
ISING IN THE PEW I HAVE TO STOP
AND ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT
I'M SAYING INSTEAD OF MINDLESSLY
RECITING WORDS WHILE PLAYING
FRUIT NINJA ON MY IPHONE.
NOW, JUST BECAUSE I THINK THE
POPE DROPPED A BALL ON THIS ONE
DOES NOT MEAN I'M NOT ON HIS
SIDE.
I'M A HUGE FAN.
HE'S GOT THE HAIR OF ANDERSON
COOPER AND THE FACE OF AN ANGEL
THAT GOT STUCK IN A FOOD
DEHYDRATOR.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT APPARENTLY NOT EVERYBODY OUT
THERE IS A FAN OF THE POPEST
WITH THE MOSTEST.
SPECIFICALLY HIS BROTHERS FROM
DER FATHERLAND.
JIM?
>> TURNS OUT THE POPE IS NOT
IMMUNE WHEN IT COMES TO SEAT
BELT SAFETY.
A GERMAN CITIZEN FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST THE PONTIFF AFTER
SPOTTING THE POPE RIDING IN THE
POPEMOBILE WITHOUT A SEAT BELT.
>> Stephen: HEY, GERMANY, THE
POPE IS INFALLIBLE.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO OBEY YOUR
STUPID TRAFFIC LAWS.
IF HE WANTS TO DO 100 MILES PER
HOUR BACKWARDS DOWN A ONE-WAY
STREET ON THE SIDEWALK FLASHING
HIS BRIGHTS TEXTING WITH ONE
HAND WHILE HE'S TOKYO DRIFTING
THROUGH A SCHOOL ZONE SCREAMING
"I DON'T GIVE A (BLEEP)" WITH
HIS WINDOWS DOWN AND HIS SYSTEM
UP, THAT IS GOD'S WILL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BESIDES, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE
HOLY FATHER HAS A NEED FOR
SPEED.
(LAUGHTER)
HE TRAVELED AT AN AVERAGE RATE
OF SIX MILES AN HOUR.
SO SHOULD THE POPE FASTEN HIS
SEAT BELT?
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
NO WAY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE
POPEMOBILE IS THE SAFEST CAR ON
THE ROAD.
HE DOESN'T JUST HAVE A DASHBOARD
JESUS, IT HAS JESUS IN THE
DASHBOARD.
THE POPE DOESN'T NEED TO WEAR A
SEAT BELT BECAUSE IF THE POPE
GETS IN AN ACCIDENT JESUS
DEPLOYS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF THE POPE HAD A LITTLE TOO
MUCH OF THE SACRAMENT, JESUS CAN
TURN THE WINE BACK INTO WATER SO
HE DOESN'T GET A D.U.I . AND
SPEAKING OF ALCOHOL, FOLKS, MY
FINAL JUDGMENT...
(APPLAUSE).
MY FINAL JUDGMENT... THANK YOU.
MY FINAL JUDGMENT INVOLVES A
CONTROVERSIAL NEW BILLBOARD.
>> THE BILLBOARDS CAME DOWN
HOURS AFTER THE ANTI-DEFAMATION
LEAGUE PUBLICLY CALLED THEM
OFFENSIVE.
THE ADS TOUTING THE POLISH
SPIRIT WODKA CLAIMED IT HAD
CHRISTMAS QUALITY AT CHANUKAH
PRICING.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: YES.
CHRISTMAS QUALITY, CHANUKAH
PRICING.
NOW, SOME SAY THIS AD IS
OFFENSIVE TO CHRISTIANS AND JEWS
AND MAYBE EVEN MUSLIMS BECAUSE
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY THAT DOG IS
AN AFGHAN.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IS THIS AD OFFENSIVE.
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
YAHWEH!
♪ HALL LAY YOU... ♪
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM
PERSONALLY OFFENDED THAT WODKA
CLAIMS THEIR $9 POTATO PEEL
BATHTUB HOOCH IS CHRISTMAS
QUALITY.
CHRISTMAS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING
BLITZED ON VODKA.
IT'S ABOUT GETTING BLITZED ON
EGGNOG.
RUMNOG AND EGG BALLS.
EVERY HOLIDAY HAS ITS OWN
LIQUOR.
WHISKEY IS FOR ST. PATRICK'S
DAY.
TEQUILA IS FOR CINCO DE MAYO AND
ABSINTHE IS FOR MARTIN LUTHER
KING DAY.
TRUST ME, YOU DRINK ENOUGH, AND
YOU WILL HAVE A DREAM.
(LAUGHTER)
AND VODKA IS A RUSSIAN DRINK.
THEIR BIG HOLIDAY ISN'T
CHRISTMAS IT'S EASTER.
AND IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF
YOU DOWN ENOUGH OF THIS SWILL IT
IS GOING TO RI
