[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[Audience chanting "Stephen"]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
I JUST... I CANNOT THANK YOU
ENOUGH.
WE HAVE BEEN ON VACATION, AND
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS I'VE HAD
THE CHANT THAT TO MYSELF.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,
BUT THIS SUNDAY IS THE TENTH
ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11th
ATTACKS.
WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T BE MORE
THAN FIVE YEARS AWAY FROM
FINDING SADDAM'S WMDs.
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE THAT TRAGIC DAY, THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT HAS DONE
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO
SAFEGUARD THE HOME HASN'T FROM
ENHANCED INTERROGATION TO
INVENTING THE PHRASE "THE
HOMELAND."
[LAUGHTER]
WE EVEN TRIED TO FIND COMMON
GROUND WITH MUSLIM EXTREMISTS
BUT ELECTING ONE OF THEM
PRESIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
OVER AND OVER... OVER AN OVER
THIS MAN HAS PROVEN THAT HE IS
NOT SERIOUS ABOUT KEEPING US
SAFE.
WHICH BRINGS US TO MY NEW
SEGMENT "THIS WEEK IN NATIONAL
SEC-OWARD-TY.
FOLKS, WHENEVER THE TERRORISTS
HAVE COME UP WITH A NEW WAY TO
ATTACK AAIR TRAVEL, THE TSA HAS
FOUND NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO
OVERREACT, SO TRAVELERS CAN THEN
RELAX AND ENJOY THEIR TWO-FOOT
BY TWO-FOOT SPACE NEXT TO A
CRYING BABY IN A PRESSUREIZED
TUBE HURDLING 40,000 FEET IN THE
AIR.
BUT ALL THIS SECURITY IS ABOUT
TO DISAPPEAR THANKS TO HOMELAND
SECURITY CHIEF JANET NAPOLITANO.
>> WE HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR TRAVELERS.
YOU WON'T HAVE TO TAKE OFF SO
MUCH, YOUR SHOES, YOUR BELL,
EVERYTHING AS YOU GO THROUGH THE
MACHINE.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
IF WE DON'T TAKE OUR SHOES OFF,
HOW WILL WE KNOW WHICH LITTLE
PIGGY WENT WEE, WEE, WEE ALL THE
WAY TO AN AL QAEDA TRAINING
CAMP?
HAS NAPOLITANO FORGOTTEN ABOUT
THE SHOE BOMB CENTER HE'S NOT
JUST AN ISOLATED NUTD JOB.
ALL TERRORISTS HAVE WORN SHOES
AT SOME POINT.
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED SHOE-RIA
LAW.
AND THANKS TO OUR VIGILANCE, UP
UNTIL NOW AMERICA HASN'T
SUFFERED ANOTHER
FOOTWEAR-RELATED ACT OF WAR,
EXCEPT FOR JIMMY CHOO'S FALL
2011 PATENT LEATHER SANDAL PUMP,
WHICH DECLARED A JIHAD ON OUR
NOTIONS OF OPEN-TOWED ELEGANCE.
AND FOLKS, IT ONLY GETS WORSE.
BECAUSE OBAMA'S TSA IS
ABANDONING OUR MOST EFFECTIVE
WEAPON AGAINST TERROR, X-RAYING
YOUR JUNK.
JIM?
>> FORT WAYNE IS ONE OF 40
AIRPORTS IN THE COUNTRY GETTING
A TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE FOR ITS
BODY SCANNER.
>> THE NEW SOFTWARE CHANGES TWO
THINGS, FIRST WHAT THE SCANNED
IMAGE LOOKS LIKE.
THIS IS THE OLD ONE.
IT SHOWS A RENDERING OF THE
PERSON'S ACTUAL BODY ALONG WITH
ANY ANOMALIES.
THIS IS THE NEW ONE.
EVERYONE'S BODY IS THE GENERIC
RENDERING AND AUNTILLIES LIKE
SOMETHING IN YOUR POCKET SHOW UP
AS A JELL-O BLOCK.
-- YELLOW BLOCK.
>> Stephen: GREAT.
THIS WILL PROTECT US IF WE GET
ATTACKED BY THE GINGERBREAD MAN.
THE KEY TOOL, FOLKS, THE KEY
TOOL IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
PORTFOLIO IS GHOSTLY IMAGES OF
OUR PEE PEES.
IT IS EASY FOR TERRORISTS TO
DISGUISE THEIR FACIAL FEATURES,
BUT EVERYONE KNOWS THERE IS NO
DISGUISING YOUR CROTCH FACE.
EVERY GENITAL IS AS UNIQUE AS A
SNOWFLAKE.
SIDE NOTE: IF YOUR GENITALS ARE
SHAPED LIKE A SNOWFLAKE, SEE A
DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.
NOW, FOLKS, WITHOUT FORCING US
TO TAKE OFF OUR SHOES AND
UNDERGOING FULL BODY SCAN, WHAT
IS TO STOP A TERRORIST FROM
BOARDING A PLANE WEARING A SHOE
BOMB ON HIS WANG?
[LAUGHTER]
DAMN.
THAT GUY'S WEARING A SIZE 13.
WHAT IS NEXT?
LETTING PEOPLE THROUGH SECURITY
WITH FOUR OUNCES OF SHAMPOO?
THE TERRORISTS WILL BE ABLE TO
RINSE AND REPEAT.
FOLKS, IN LIGHT OF OBAMA'S LAX
SECURITY STANDARDS, I AM NOW
CALLING ON ALL PASSENGERS TO
PROVE THAT YOU ARE SANE,
UNTHREATENING TRAVELERS BY DOING
WHAT I DO, GETTING COMPLETELY
NAKED IN THE AIRPORT SECURITY
LINE AND INVITE ANYONE IN
UNIFORM TO PROBE YOU WITH A
RUBBER GLOVE.
AND AGAIN, I WANT TO EXTEND MY
COURT-ORDERED APOLOGIES TO THE
COUNTER STAFF AT CINNABUN.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, THAT FROSTING IS HOT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEY ARE VERY GENEROUS WITH
IT.
NATION...
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
