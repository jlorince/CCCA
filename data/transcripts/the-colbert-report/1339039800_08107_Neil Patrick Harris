PLEASE WELCOME NEIL PATRICK HARRIS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEIL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, YOU CLEAN UP NICE!
>> THANK YOU, YOU AS WELL.
>> Stephen: IT'S WEIRD TO SEE YOU HERE.
>> I'LL SAY!
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I'M USED TO SEEING YOU WHEN WE'RE BOTH ON
STAGE AT LINCOLN CENTER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF CHEERING PEOPLE.
>> ADORING FANS.
ADORING SONDHEIM FANS.
>> Stephen: AND SONDHEIM IN THE FRONT ROW.
>> GIVING NOTES.
IN THE MIDDLE OF SONGS.
>> Stephen: UH-UH.
>> PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WE DID "COMPANY" TOGETHER.
>> WE DID.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND WE'RE A LITTLE BIT FRIENDS.
>> YES, CAN I SEE THAT I FIND YOU A THREAT?
>> GO ON.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE THE CLASSIC TRIPLE THREAT.
YOU'RE AN ACTOR, SINGER, DANCER.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE ALSO THE BIGGEST THREAT OF ALL,
YOU'RE A GAY PERSON I LIKE.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOUR THREAT IS THAT YOU MAKE BEING GAY NOT SEEM THREATENING.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOUR HAPPINESS DOES NOT TAKE MY HAPPINESS AWAY.
(LAUGHTER) DO YOU ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A LIKABLE GAY PERSON?
DO YOU ADMIT THAT CRIME?
>> I GLADLY ADMIT THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT'S YOUR PLAN.
>> YEAH, TO SEEM ACCEPTABLE.
>> O WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROMTHAT?S
>> Stephen: YOU SEEM TO HAVE A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.
YOU HAVE A COUPLE LOVELY KIDS YOU SEEM TO TREAT WELL.
I ALWAYS SEE PICTURES OF YOU LIKE BALANCING YOUR KID ON ONE HAND.
>> IT'S A CIRCUS TRICK!
>> Stephen: YOU DO!
YOU JUGGLE YOUR CHILDREN.
>> I DO.
I DO.
I WISH WE HAD TRIPLETS SO IT WOULD BE A BETTER...
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO HOSTING THE TONIES.
>> INDEED.
>> Stephen: THIS SUNDAY NIGHT ON ANIMAL PLANET.
(LAUGHTER) CHECK YOUR LOCAL LISTINGS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU DO THEATER?
BECAUSE YOU DO T.V., DO MOVIES.
GOING BACK TO DO THEATER, THAT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, HAVING LIKE A SPORTS CAR BUT OCCASIONALLY YOU
GET ON ONE OF THOSE PENNY FARTHERRINGS WITH A BIG WHEEL IN FRONT AND THE LITTLE WHEEL IN BACK.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?
>> WELL, I THINK PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THAT.
WHEN YOU'RE DOING T.V. OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE ONLY PERFORMING TO A VERY SMALL GROUP
OF PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO AND YOU DON'T GET ANY KIND OF MEDIA SEE,
YOU DON'T SEE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, EITHER ACTING ON IT OR OBSERVING IT AND WHEN YOU COME
TO NEW YORK AND SEE A BROADWAY SHOW THERE'S A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE AND EVERYONE IS
WATCHING THE SAME SHOW SO I ADMIRE THE ACTORS AND SINGERS AND DANCERS DOING IT EVERY
SINGLE PERFORMANCE, TWICE ON SATURDAY, TWICE ON WEDNESDAY AND I ADMIRE IT AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER.
I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S A COOL,
LIKE, PHYSICAL FEAT.
THEY'RE MORE ATHLETES TO ME THAN THEY ARE...
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THE OLYMPICS SHOULD ALLOW THEATER?
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS OLYMPIC EVENT.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD MEDAL IN JAZZ HANDS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW YOU'RE... YOU'RE HOSTING THIS WEEKEND.
WHO ARE... WHAT ARE THE BIG SHOWS THAT HAVE GOT... WHO SHOULD WIN?
MAKE SOME ENEMIES ON BROADWAY RIGHT NOW.
WHO SHOULD WIN?
>> WELL, IT'S AN INTERESTING YEAR BECAUSE YOU NORMALLY KNOW WHO'S GOING TO WIN.
WE KNEW PRETTY MUCH THAT "BOOK OF MORMON" WOULD WIN LAST YEAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MY THEORY THEY'RE GOING TO WIN AGAIN THIS YEAR.
>> THEY MIGHT.
>> Stephen: IT'S THAT BIG.
>> THERE'S A SHOW CALLED "ONCE" BASED ON THE MOVIE "ONCE."
IT'S LIKE A COOL SMALLISH INDEPENDENT MUSICAL THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF GREAT RESPONSE.
IT'S AGAINST THE DISNEY JUGGERNAUT "NEWS ZIS" BASED ON THE NOT SO SUCCESSFUL MOVIE
NEWSIES." (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S A GIANT SUCCESSFUL MUSICAL SO THESE TWO ARE IN COMPETITION.
>> Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M PULLING FOR.
>> WHAT'S THAT?
>> Stephen: I'M PULLING FOR "JESUS CHRIST, SUPERSTAR."
>> WHY IN THE WORLD...
>> Stephen: IT IS THE LEAST GAY MUSICAL BECAUSE IT'S GOT JESUS IN IT, OKAY?
JUST THIS ONE GUY WITH GREAT ABSHANGING OUT WITH 12 OF HISGREAT  BUDDIES.
>> NOTHING GAY ABOUT THAT AT ALL.
>> Stephen: NEIL ARE YOU IN ANY OF THE MUSICAL THIS IS YEAR?
>> (LAUGHS) I'M NOT IN MY ANY OF THE MUSICAL THIS IS YEAR.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT?
>> I'M DOING A T.V. SHOW.
>> Stephen: YOU PLAY BARTY SIMPSON ON THAT SHOW, RIGHT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YES, I DO.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'RE A THREAT
BECAUSE S BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY,
VERY CONVINCING AS A STRAIGHT GUY IN THAT.
>> RIGHT ON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RIGHT ON BECAUSE ONLY STRAIGHT GUYS SAY RIGHT ON,
RIGHT?
DID YOU SLIP INTO CHARACTER RIGHT THERE?
>> GAY GUYS SAY "DAMN SKIPPY!" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BUT IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WERE A
STRAIGHT GUY, THAT'S HOW GOOD OF AN ACTOR YOU ARE.
WHO ELSE IN HOLLYWOOD IS GAY?
(LAUGHTER) DON'T KNOW?
>> THERE'S A COUPLE.
THERE'S A FEW OF THEM.
>> Stephen: NAMES?
CLINTON EASTWOOD?
>> HE'S SUPER GAY.
SUPER, SUPER GAY.
>> Stephen: WELL, I WANT TO THANK YOU.
I WANT TO THANK YOU... I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING A GAY MAN ON YOUR SHOW.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A FIRST.
>> I DON'T THINK SO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NEIL PATRICK HARRIS HOSTING THE TONIES THIS SUNDAY ON CBS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
