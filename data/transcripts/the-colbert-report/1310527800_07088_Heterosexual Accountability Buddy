[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, ALL'S FAIR WHEN IT COMES
TO COVERING PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES BUT THERE ARE SOME
THINGS IN POLITICS THAT ARE
OFF-LIMITS -- LIKE A CANDIDATES'
SPOUSE OR CHILDREN.
BUT LATELY, THE BLAME-STREAM
MEDIA HAS STARTED GOING AFTER
MICHELE BACHMANN'S HUSBAND
DR. MARCUS BACHMANN.
THEY'RE ATTACKING HIS CHRISTIAN
PSYCHO-THERAPY BUSINESS IN AN
ATTEMPT TO RUIN HIS GOOD NAME.
>> DR. BACHMANN'S BRAND OF
COUNSELING IS HIGHLY
CONTROVERSIAL AND COULD BECOME A
CAMPAIGN ISSUE.
DR. BACHMANN RUNS A CHRISTIAN
COUNSELING FIRM.
THAT AT TIMES, ACCORDING TO
FORMER PATIENTS, HAS TRIED TO
CONVERT GAY MEN INTO
HETEROSEXUALS THROUGH CHRISTIAN
PRAYER.
>> Stephen: CHRISTIANITY IS THE
ONLY WAY TO CURE GAYNESS.
JUST GET ON YOUR KNEES, TAKE A
SWIG OF WINE, AND ACCEPT THE
BODY OF A MAN INTO YOUR MOUTH.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW IN THE PAST, DR. BACHMANN
HAS DENIED THAT HIS COUNSELING
CENTER ENGAGES IN GAY THERAPY.
BUT THE GAY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION
"TRUTH WINS OUT" SENT AN
UNDERCOVER HOMOSEXUAL, POSING AS
AN OVER-COVER HOMOSEXUAL, TO
RECORD HIS COUNSELORS WITH
SECRET HOMOSEXUAL CAMERAS.
JIM?
>> HE COULD CURE YOUR
HOMOSEXUALITY?
>> YES.
>> IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?
>> YES.
>> THE TRUTH IS GOD HAS DESIGNED
OUR EYES TO BE ATTRACTED TO THE
WOMEN'S BODY, TO BE ATTRACTED TO
EVERYTHING, TO BE ATTRACTED TO
HER BREASTS.
>> Stephen: YES! BREASTS!
THANK YOU, JESUS!
[LAUGHTER]
GOD WANTS US TO STARE AT THEM!
THAT'S WHY HE PUT THOSE LITTLE
THINGS ON THE TIP -- WHAT DO YOU
CALL THEM?
LITTLE CHEST PENISES?
WHATEVER, NIBLETS.
WHATEVER!
AND WHEN THE GAY MAN ASKED THE
COUNSELOR IF IT WAS ADVISABLE TO
ATTEND A FRIENDS' GAY WEDDING,
THE COUNSELOR RECOMMENDED HE GO
WITH "A HETEROSEXUAL
ACCOUNTABILITY BUDDY IN TOW."
[LAUGHTER]
SOUND ADVICE.
WHEN GOING TO A SAME SEX GAY
WEDDING, ALWAYS BRING ANOTHER
DUDE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT WAY HE CAN DRINK WITH YOU,
DANCE WITH YOU, AND SHARE A
HOTEL ROOM WITH YOU.
REMEMBER -- INSIST ON ONE KING
SIZED BED.
BECAUSE TWO QUEENS IS KIND OF
GAY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NORMALLY, I'M AS STRAIGHT AS THE
NEXT GUY, BUT TONIGHT, MY NEXT
GUY IS OUR GUEST DAN SAVAGE.
HE IS WEAPONS-GRADE GAY.
AND HE'S THE WORST KIND, TOO:
SMART, THOUGHTFUL, CHARMING, AND
HE ALWAYS SMELLS LIKE THE FIRST
DAY OF SPRING.
[LAUGHTER]
SO TO STEEL MYSELF FOR HIS
APPEARANCE TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO
BRING MY OWN HETEROSEXUAL
ACCOUNTABILITY BUDDY TO KEEP ME
ON THE STRAIGHT AND
NARROW-MINDED.
OKAY, I'LL GET MY BUILDING
MANAGER TAD OUT HERE. TAD?
>> Stephen: SO, YOU'RE A
HETEROSEXUAL, RIGHT?
>> EXACTLY, I'M A CONFIRMED
BACHELOR.
I WOULD NEVER MARRY A WOMAN.
>> Stephen: SMART MAN.
KEEPING YOUR OPTIONS OPEN.
>> RIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO GET
TIED DOWN.
I WANT TO BE AVAILABLE--
FOR WOMEN.
>> Stephen: GREAT- ARE YOU BUSY
RIGHT NOW?
>> WELL, NOW'S NOT A GREAT TIME.
I HAVE SOME GUYS OVER HERE, WE
WERE GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE
BOILER ROOM.
>> Stephen: TO FIX THE BOILER?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S GOING
TO HAVE TO WAIT.
I NEED A FULL-TIME HANDYMAN FOR
A VERY ROUGH JOB.
>> TO HELP WITH THE INTERVIEW?
>> Stephen: SURE.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: WHEN WE COME BACK,
TAD AND I WILL GO DOWN ON -- SIT
DOWN ON -- SIT DOWN WITH DAN
SAVAGE.
