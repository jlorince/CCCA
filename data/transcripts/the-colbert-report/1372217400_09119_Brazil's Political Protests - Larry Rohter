THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. ROHTER.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]HERE'S THE BOOK.
HERE YOU GO.
BRAZIL ON THE RISE.
OKAY.
SIR, HOW DID THIS START?
OKAY?
YOU'VE GOT RIOTS IN THE STREET.
YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDSOF PEOPLE,
MILLIONS ON SOME DAYS.WHAT IS IT?
DID THEY GET UPSET BYCORRUPTION?
WAS THERE A KILLING?
DID THEY GIVE ALL THE AMAZONAWAY TO MacDONALD'S FOR
BEEF?
WHAT STARTED IT?
>> CORRUPTION.
AS YOU MENTIONED, THE MONEYBEING SPENT ON THE WORLD CUP AND
THE OLYMPICS.
THE FEELING THAT A GOOD CHUNK OFTHAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO INTO
THE HANDS OF, YOU KNOW,POLITICIANS AND, YOU KNOW,
BUSINESSMEN TAKING A CUT.
CONCERNS THAT THE MONEY THAT'SGOING THERE IS MONEY BETTER
SPENT ON HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION,PUBLIC SECURITY.
>> Stephen: SO THEY'RE ASKINGFOR GOVERNMENT HANDOUTS?
OKAY. WAH WAH WAH.GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.
WELCOME TO OBAMA'S LATINAMERICA. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RESAYING.
>> NOT EXACTLY.
>> OKAY, SO WHAT WAS THETRIGGERING POINT?
WHAT STARTED THIS.
>> THE TRIGGER WAS SOMETHINGPRETTY INNOCUOUS REALLY, A
TEN-CENT INCREASE IN BUS FARES.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
A TEN-CENT INCREASE IN BUSFARES.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE TOOK TO THESTREETS FOR A TEN-CENT INCREASE
IN BUS FARE?
HOW GOOD ARE THESE BUSES?
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING TOOTRY TO CALM THIS DOWN?
ARE THEY SAYING WE'LL GIVE YOUSOMETHING OR ARE THEY SAYING
PULL YOURSELVES UP BY YOUR OWNBOOTSTRAPS, IF THEY EVER WORE
BOOTS OR PANTS THERE?
>> THIS IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THEARAB SPRING OR CHINA BECAUSE YOU
HAVE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTTHAT'S TRYING IN ESSENCE TO
COOPT THIS MOVEMENT.
THEY ARE SAYING ROLL BACK THEBUS FARE INCREASE.
>> Stephen: REALLY? THEFIRST THING THEY SAY IS, WE'LLGIVE YOU YOUR TEN CENTS BACK.
>> OKAY.
AND TODAY THE PRESIDENT SAYING,WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE A PLEBISCITE TO DETERMINEWHAT KINDS OF CHANGES IN THE
POLITICAL SYSTEM WE SHOULD MAKE.
YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO BRING THEPEOPLE INTO THE PROCESS MORE.
>> Stephen: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLEIN THE STREETS?
ARE THESE JUST POOR PEOPLE INTHE STREETS?
>> NO.
THE THING ABOUT BRAZIL IS THATIN THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE
COUNTRY HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY SOTHAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE ZOOMED
PAST ITALY, RUSSIA, INDIA, EVENGREAT BRITAIN, AND THEY'RE
ZEROING IN ON FRANCE.
THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THEWORLD.
AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER PLACES, ALOT OF THAT WEALTH IS NOW BEING
DISTRIBUTED AMONG PEOPLE WHOWERE FORMERLY POOR BUT, YOU
KNOW, 50 MILLION PEOPLE HAVEMOVED INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS.
>>SO, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS A LOTOF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RIOTING.
DO YOU THINK WE DON'T HAVERIOTS HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN RIDOF OUR MIDDLE CLASS?
PROBABLY THE SAFEST THING TO DO.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
