>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT HAVE A NEW ALBUM CALLED "I LEARNED THE HARD WAY."
YOU SHOULD LEARN THE EASY WAY,
COPYING OFF THE ASIAN KID.
PLEASE WELCOME SHARON JONES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MS. JONES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> GLAD TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: NOW, YOUNG LADY,
SOMETHING I RESPECT ABOUT YOUR STYLE, OKAY, IT IS OLD-SCHOOL SOUL SINGING.
WHO WERE YOUR INFLUENCES OTHER THAN ME?
GO AHEAD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, ARETHA, JAMES BROWN,
O'DISREDDING, TINA TURNER.
>> Stephen: KEEP GOING.
>> ANYONE FROM MOTOWN.
>> Stephen: MOTOWN.
OKAY.
ONE THING I DO NOT RESPECT ABOUT WHAT YOUR DOING IS THAT YOU USE AN OLD RECORDING STYLE.
ARE YOU CUTTING EYES AT ME?
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I'M GETTING CUT TO RIBBONS.
I'M GOING TO NEED A NEW SUIT WHEN THIS IS OVER.
>> I'LL TAKE SOME OF THE CUT OUT.
STEEP DEEP YOU USE AN OLD RECORDING STYLE.
YOU BUILT AN OLD STUDIO,
CORRECT?
>> SORT OF.
NOT ME.
>> Stephen: TOGETHER.
FRIENDS.
>> WE BUILT IT.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT THE LATEST DIGITAL RECORDING EQUIPMENT?
WHY THE OLD EQUIPMENT?
>> COULD WE GET THE SOUND THAT WE HAVE NOW?
YOU KNOW THE DIGITAL STUFF?
>> Stephen: I KNOW THE DIGITAL STUFF?
HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD JAMES BROWN SOUND IF WE COULD AUTO TUNE HIM.
GET WITH THE TIMES, MY FRIEND.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NO?
>> NO.
IT'S A SOUND.
I'M STICKING WHAT WE'RE DOING.
AND YOU ABOUT AIN'T GOING TO...
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THIS WORD, BUT YOU ARE FIERCE.
AND YOU HAVE THE HISTORY TO SHOW IT.
BEFORE YOU WERE THIS BIG STAR,
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE JOBS YOU HAD, YOUNG LADY.
>> YOU KNOW, LITTLE JOBS LIKE CORRECTIONS, STUFF LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE A CORRECTIONS OFFICER.
>> CORRECTIONS.
>> Stephen: AT RIKERS ISLAND.
>> AT RIKERS.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THAT JOB COMES IN HANDY NOW?
HOW MANY OF THE DAP KINGS HAVE BEEN TASED IS WHAT I'M ASKING?
THE SAX PLAYER COMES IN A LITTLE EARLY...
>> NEVER.
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE ALSO A WEDDING SINGER FOR MANY YEARS.
WHICH SONG FROM WEDDING SINGING MAKES YOU WAKE UP SCREAMING?
"CELEBRATION," "YMCA," "HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY THAT I LOVE
YOU," "YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL"?
DO THE DAP KINGS HAVE A LINE OF SUCCESSION?
IF ONE OF THEM STEPS DOWN, DOES THEIR INFANT SON ASCEND TO THE THRONE OF FUNK?
>> THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.
THEY'RE REALLY WORKING ON PUTTING THE KIDS THERE.
WE DO HAVE SOMEONE TO STEP IN WHEN SOMEONE CAN'T FILL IN.
BUT NOT THEIR CHILDREN, NOT YET.
THEY'RE TOO YOUNG.
>> Stephen: DO YOU NEED ME TO STEP IN AT ANY TIME?
YOU LOOK AT ME AND YOU SAY FUNK.
>> I' IS FUNK.||||
