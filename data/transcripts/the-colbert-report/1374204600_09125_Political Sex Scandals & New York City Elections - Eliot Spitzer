THE SUBWAY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY
THIS WEEK IS THE POLITICAL
COMEBACK OF FORMER NEW YORK
GOVERNOR AND REGISTERED LIP
DONOR ELIOT SPITZER.
JIM?
>> IN THE RACE, FORMER
GOVERNOR ELIOT SPITZER
BARELY HAS BEEN IN THE RACE
FOR A WEEK AND ALREADY HE'S
LEADING MANHATTAN BOROUGH
PRESIDENT SCOTT STRINGER
48-33 PERCENT.
>> Stephen: YES, ELIOT
SPITZER COULD VERY WELL BE
NEW YORK'S NEXT COMPTROLLER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
THAT MEANS?
I DON'T.
BECAUSE WHAT THE HELL IS A
COMPTROLLER?
HERE TO TELL US IS CANDIDATE
FOR NEW YORK CITY
COMPTROLLER ELIOT SPITZER.
ELLIOTT, THANK YOU FOR
COMING.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: OKAY, ELLIOTT,
YOU ALSO GOT A BOOK HERE.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: IT'S CALL
PRODUCT TECTING CAPITALISM
CASE BY CASE.
WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER.
>> CAN WE DO THAT NOW.
>> Stephen: ELLIOTT.
>> YES, SIR.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS A
COMPTROLLER.
WHAT DOES A COMPTROLLER DO.
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO TELL ME.
THAT'S WHY I SHOWED UP.
THIS IS ACTUALLY A HUGELY
IMPORTANT POSITION.
YOU CONTROL OR HAVE A SAY IN
THE INVESTMENT OF OVER 140
BILLION DOLLARS OF PENSION
DOLLARS THAT ARE THE
PENSIONS FOR FORMING
MUNICIPAL WORMER-- WORKERS,
YOU SEE OVERTHE THE BUDGET,
YOU SEE THAT THE TAX DOLLARS
ARE USED FOR THE
PURPOSE-- YOU SEEM SO INTENT
IN LISTENING.
>> Stephen: NO, I DO, IT'S
GOOD TO KNOW.
GIVEN A POSITION OF THIS
RESPONSIBILITY, SHOULDN'T
THE JOB OF COMPTROLLER GO TO
SOMEONE WHO HAS SHOWN A
MODICUM OF SELF-COMPTROL.
(APPLAUSE)
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY-- WHY, WHY
SHOULD, WHY SHOULD THE
PEOPLE TRUST NEW.
>> BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF
THE RECORD.
MANY YEARS AS ATTORNEY
GENERAL, DOING THINGS WITH
RESPECT TO CAPITAL MARKETS
THAT RELATE DIRECTLY TO THE
OFFICE OF COMPTROLLER.
>> Stephen: ATTACKING WALL
STREET.
>> WELL, ATTACKING,
REGULATING IT SO IT WAS
HONEST AND FAIR AND
TRANSPARENT.
AND BACK IN 2000, 2001
LEADING TO THE CRISIS OF
2008 SAYING THERE ARE
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS HERE
THAT NOBODY WANTED TO ADMIT.
>> REGULATION IS THE WORD
YOU USED.
YOU CAN'T BE PRO REGULATION
AND PRO CAPITALISM.
CAPITALISM YOU HAVE TO CUT
THE STRINGS AND FLY, BABY
DOLL.
>> THAT IS SO LAST CENTURY.
>> Stephen: WHY?
>> HERE'S WHY.
THE REALITY IS, OUR
UNDERSTANDING OF MARKETS WAS
FLAWED.
MARKET DOES NOT WORK IF YOU
DON'T HAVE ANNUM PRIOR.
YOU CANNOT LET THE LINESMAN
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM CALL
THE HOLDING PENALTY.
YOU CANNOT LETED WALL STREET
FIRMS GET AWAY WITH THIS
THING CALLED SELF-REGULATION
T WILL LEAD TO ANOTHER
CATACLYSM.
>> WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THAT, THAT IS NOT THE
JOB OF THE COMPTROLLER WHY
DOW WANT THIS JOB?
BECAUSE BEFORE YOU HAD YOUR
FALL FROM GRACE OR WHATEVER
HER NAME WAS-- YOU--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BEFORE YOU HAD
YOUR FALL FROM GRACE, YOU
WERE THE GOVERNOR OF THE
STATE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE THE
GOVERNOR SLAFERP!.
AREN'T YOU ONE AT THE SAME
TIME BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW
THIS JOB.
>> THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY
I'M TRYING TO GET RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE.
HERE'S WHY.
IN THE BOOK, WHICH YOU
KINDLY HELD UP.
>> Stephen: THERE IT IS.
>> I MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT
OWNERSHIP TRUMPS REGULATION.
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, I
KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
WONKY TYPE OF THING.
YOU CAN'T REGULATION YOUR
WAY TO GOOD JUDGEMENT IN THE
CORPORATE BOARDROOMS.
YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE YOUR WAY
TO GOOD JUDGEMENT, ONLY IF
THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE
COMPANY, AND THAT'S US, IT'S
OUR MONEY, OUR PENSION
DOLLARS, OUR MUTUAL FUNDS,
ONLY IF THEY LISTEN TO
US-- .
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BEFORE WE GO.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BEFORE WE GO,
ONE LAST QUESTION, AND THAT
IS, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LEADING
IN THE POLLS.
YOU COULD WIN THIS THING.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WEINER
COULD WIN THIS THING, MARK
SANFORD HAD A COMEBACK.
DO YOU THINK THAT IT SEEMS
THAT VOTERS ARE MORE
FORGIVING THAN THEY USED TO
BE?
DO YOU THINK THAT SIGNALS
PROGRESS FOR OUR COUNTRY OR
THE SLOW DECAY OF OUR MORAL
VALUES?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WOW.
WOW.
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
>> Stephen: THIS EIGHT
CHARLIE ROSE MOTHER [BLEEP].
COME BACK AND TELL ME.
COME BACK AND TELL ME.
ELIOT SPITZER, CANDIDATE FOR
NEW YORK CITY COMPTROLLER.
