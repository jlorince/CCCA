[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, WE ARE ALL OF US TOGETHER, WE ARE BREATHING A LITTLE EASIER TONIGHT BECAUSE
THEY HAVE CAPTURED THE TIMES SQUARE BOMBER FAISAL SHAHZAD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE BIG BREAK, THE BIG BREAK CAME WHEN AN HEROIC TIMES SQUARE SIDEWALK ARTIST WAS ABLE TO
PROVIDE THIS SKETCH OF THE CULPRIT.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
POLICE ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A SKATE-BOARDING TENNIS PLAYER WITH A GIANT HEAD.
NOW, I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO PROFILE, OKAY, BUT THIS FAISAL CHARACTER, FAISAL, CAME FROM
EXACTLY WHERE YOU'D EXPECT -- CONNECTICUT.
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO CLOSE THAT BORDER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND MY WORST SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED WHEN I SAW THIS PHOTO.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO STEREOTYPE,
FOLKS, BUT HE'S NOT JUST FROM CONNECTICUT.
HE'S A CONNECTICUT DOUCHEBAG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THEY CAUGHT THE GUY, THIS FAISAL GUY, AND IT'S A HUGE RELIEF,
BECAUSE SOME OF THE DETAILS ABOUT THIS CASE HAVE REALLY TROUBLED ME.
>> THIS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS AMATEURISH, ALMOST RUBE GOLDBERG LIKE.
>> I WOULD DESCRIBE THE BOMB AS A RUBE GOLDBERG CON TRAPPION.
>> A RUBE GOLDBERG-LIKE APPROACH.
>> SUCH A RUBE GOLDBERGESQUE KIND OF DELIVERY SYSTEM.
>> Stephen: AND WHO WAS JUST ON MY SHOW LAST THURSDAY WITH A HOMEMADE RUBE GOLDBERG CONTRAPTION?
OK GO.
NOW, I'VE HAD MY SUSPICIONS ABOUT THOSE GUYS EVER SINCE I SAW THEIR TERRORIST TRAINING VIDEO.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NOW THAT I KNOW IT'S NOT THEM,
MY APOLOGIES TO YOU GUYS FOR REPORTING YOU TO THE FEDS.
BUT I AM SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TURN THOSE HOMELAND SECURITY RECTAL SCOPES INTO A YOUTUBE SENSATION.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, THEY GOT THE GUY, AND THIS WAS NO ORDINARY ARREST.
>> LAST NIGHT, LAST-SECOND ARREST OF FAISAL SHAHZAD ABOUT TO TAKE OFF FOR DUBAI BUY.
>> ON THE PLANE, THE PLANE IS BACKING OFF OF THE GREAT, MOVING ON TO THE TARMAC.
>> F.B.I. GOT THERE IN THE NICK OF TIME, PULLED HIM OFF THAT FLIGHT.
>> IT WAS A VERY CLOSE CALL.
HE ALMOST GOT AWAY
>> INCREDIBLE, DRAMATIC FORM.
>> IT BEGAN WITH MAKESHIFT BOMB AND ENDED WITH A BOARDED GETAWAY.
>>
>> Stephen: YEAH.
[APPLAUSE]
IT'S JUST LIKE AN ACTION MOVIE.
IT EVEN HAS A BLACK PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, THOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE SHAHZAD ALMOST GOT AWAY, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE PLAN THE WHOLE TIME.
>> THE AUTHORITIES AT THE FACILITIES LET HIM GET ON BOARD THAT PLANE, WAITED TO THE VERY
LAST MOMENT IN CASE HE MADE A LAST-MINUTE PHONE CALL OR E-MAIL, TRYING COLLECT AS MUCH
INFORMATION AS THEY COULD.
>> Stephen: IT'S A GOOD THING,
TOO.
SHAHZAD MADE LAST-MINUTE PHONE CALL ON THE PLANE.
THE F.B.I. HAS JUST RELEASED THE AUDIO.
JIM?
[PHONE RINGING]
THANK YOU FOR CALLING THE TALIBAN IN PAKISTAN.
WE CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE BURNING DOWN A GIRLS SCHOOL.
INSHALLAH, YOU WILL LEAVE A MESSAGE.
>> HELLO, MY BROTHERS, IT'S FAISAL SHAHZAD, ALTHOUGH FROM NOW ON CALL ME FAISAL SHAZAM,
BECAUSE, POOF, I AM GONE.
OH, LOOK, THE IN-FLIGHT MOVIE IS "THE BLIND SIDE." I KNOW I'M GOING TO CRY.
OH, EXCUSE ME, INFIDEL WHORE,
CAN I GET ANOTHER MIMOSA PLEASE?
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.
WE'LL BE RETURNING TO THE GATE MOMENTARILY.
>> OH, [BLEEP].
>> Stephen: SO I HAVE TO COMMEND THE AUTHORITIES, NOT JUST FOR CAPTURING THIS GUY, BUT||
