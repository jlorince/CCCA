(APPLAUSE) THIS... THIS IS THE KIND OF FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE WE
NEED BECAUSE IT'S A DANGEROUS WORLD OUT THERE, FOLKS.
THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOW IN ITS 11th YEAR.
THAT MEANS IT'S A TWEEN.
(LAUGHTER) WHICH EXPLAINS WHY IT'S SO DISTANT AND WE JUST CAUGHT IT WITH DRUGS.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE THESE YEARS YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT THE WAR.
EVEN I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IN THE A WHILE.
I'M BUSY THROWING A CONCERT SERIES ON THE DECK OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER.
I JUST COULDN'T SEE HOW TO FIT THE MILITARY INTO THAT.
(LAUGHTER) NOW THANK GOODNESS FOR NBC WHO LAST NIGHT BROUGHT THE WAR HOME
IN THE TWO-HOUR PREMIER OF "STARS EARN STRIPES."
>> THESE CELEBRITIES HAVE BEEN TAKE ON THE A SECRET CAMP TO BE TESTED.
>> THERE ARE NO STUNT DOUBLES.
THIS IS REAL.
>> UNDER FIRE.
>> REAL AMMUNITION.
REAL EXPLOSIONS.
REAL DANGER.
>> EVERY EPISODE IS AN ACTUAL MISSION.
>> Stephen: THAT MISSION?
ATTRACT MALES 18-35.
(LAUGHTER) AND WHO... 40 ARE THE HEROES?
DEAN CAIN.
NICK LACHEY.
TODD PALIN.
PICABO STREET.
DOLVET QUINCE.
AND THE REST.
(LAUGHTER) AND THE OPERATIONAL MASTERMIND IS FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, RETIRED FOUR-STAR
GENERAL, AND FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER WESLEY CLARK.
HE IS A GEORGE PATTON.
HE IS A DOUGLAS MacARTHUR.
BUT DOES HE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A JEFF PROBST?
(LAUGHTER) JUST LOOK AT THE SACRIFICE THESE T.V. HEROES ARE MAKING.
>> FOR ME, I'M GOING TO BE LIVING OUT A LITTLE FANTASY OF
BEING, LIKE A WARRIOR PRINCESS.
>> KIND OF A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO STEP IN THERE AND GET
IN THE STREFRPBLGS, SO TO SPEAK.
>> YES, ONCE IN A LIFETIME,
OTHER THAN ALL THE TIMES YOU COULD HAVE ENLISTED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND STILL YOUNG.
STILL VERY YOUNG.
THINK ABOUT IT.
(APPLAUSE) AND, FOLKS, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT RATINGS.
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER MARK BURNETT EXPLAINS WHY.
>> "STARS ON STRIPES" IS AN EPIC NEW SHOW.
IT'S ABOUT HONORING OUR VETERANS.
>> Stephen: YOU HEAR, THAT IRAQ VETERANS?
IT'S ABOUT HONORING YOU.
WE CAN'T DO A PARADE JUST YET BUT WE'VE GOT THE GUY FROM 98
DEGREES THROW AGAIN GRADES WITH T.V.'S "SUPERMAN." THIS IS A 100% AUTHENTIC WAR EXPERIENCE.
>> WE GO ON REAL MISSIONS.
WE RECEIVE REAL TRAINING.
WE GO WITH REAL LIVE FIRE.
>> I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING ON A REAL MISSION WITH REAL WEAPONS AND REAL AMMUNITION.
>> Stephen: YES, THIS IS REAL.
(LAUGHTER) REAL MISSIONS AND REAL AMMUNITION.
AND REAL JETSKIS ZIPPING IN AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE.
(LAUGHTER) IN FACT, THIS IS BETTER THAN REAL.
BECAUSE THIS IS WAR AS WE IMAGINE IT!
NONE OF THAT SETTING UP A CHECKPOINT AND LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS TRYING TO SUSS OUT
CENTURIES OLD TRIBAL CONFLICTS OR ENGAGING IN OUTREACH WITH LOCAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO
AFFECT A STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.
IT'S JUST BLOWING (BLEEP) UP!
EVEN THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T BLOW UP, LIKE PLYWOOD AND PLYWOOD BOXES.
(LAUGHTER) MY ONE CRITICISM HERE?
WHEN THEY DISMISSED DOLVET QUINCE LAST NIGHT, WHY DIDN'T HE BLOW UP?
YEAH!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HONORING!
AND, FOLKS, LIKE ALL WARRIORS,
THESE FAUX ARMED FORCES, OR ARMED FAUX-CES, HAVE THEIR OMENTS OF SELF-DOUBT.M
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY I LET MY AGENT TALK ME INTO THIS.
>> Stephen: SEE?
THAT'S THE REAL EXPERIENCE OF WAR.
AND I'M SURE THE 80,000 U.S.
SOLDIERS RISKING THEIR LIVES IN AFGHANISTAN ARE WONDERING WHY THEY LET THEIR AGENTS TALK THEM
INTO THAT.
THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE TAKE THAN GUEST SPOT ON "HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER." (LAUGHTER) YEAH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HONORING!
OF COURSE, LIKE EVERY WAR YOU HAVE YOUR HIPPO PROTESTERS.
ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU AND EIGHT OTHER NOBEL PEACE ALREADY A YETS WROTE A LETTER TO NBC
CRITICIZING "STARS EARN STRIPES" AS TRYING TO SOMEHOW SANITIZE WAR BY LIKENING IT TO AN
ATHLETIC COMPETITION.
OH, PLEASE, BISHOP TUTU IF THAT IS YOUR REAL NAME, THIS IS NOTHING LIKE AN ATHLETIC COMPETITION.
THOSE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS!
I SAY THESE BRAVE CELEBRI-TROOPERS DESERVE YOUR SUPPORT.
SO PLEASE SEND LETTERS.
SEND CARE PACKAGES.
OR EVEN BETTER, SOMEBODY SHOULD DO A USE SEW TOUR FOR STARS EARN STRIPES" TO BRING MUCH-NEEDED
ENTERTAIN
