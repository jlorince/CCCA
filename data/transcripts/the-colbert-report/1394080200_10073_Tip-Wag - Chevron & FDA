FOLKS, IF YOU READ THE BIBLE,IF YOU READ THE BIBLE THEN
YOU KNOW THAT OUR LORD SAIDJUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED.
I SAID SPEAK ENGLISH, JESUSTHIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG
OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BING BING BING BING
BING-- NATION, I LOVES ME SOME
HYDRAULIC FRACKING.
NOT ONLY IS IT GOING TO MAKEUS ENERGY INDEPENDENT, I
KNOW MAKES MARK RUFFALOANGRY AND
I'M TRYING TO UNLEASH THEHULK.
SOME HAVE TURNED ON BIG OILCOMPANIES BECAUSE FRACKING
HAS BEEN KNOWN TOCONTAMINATE WATER SUPPLIES
AND CAUSE TINY EARTHQUAKES.
BUT THESE COMPANIES ARE GOODGUYS.
TAKE CHEVRON.
RECENTLY AFTER CAUSING AFATAL GAS EXPLOSION IN
BOBTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA, THEYDID THE RIGHT THING.
>> CHEVRON IS TRYING TO MAKEAMENDS FOR THE DEADLY GAS
BALL FIRE THAT TOOK NEARLY AWEEK TO PUT OUT.
THE COMPANY WENTDOOR-TO-DOOR IN THE AREA
NEAR THE WELL THIS WE CANHANDING OUT COUPONS.
>> THE COUPON IS FOR A LARGEPIZZA AND A TWO LITRE DRINK
FROM THE LOCAL PIZZA SHOP.
>> Stephen: FREE PIZZA.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE THAT'S FOR A GAS
WELL FIRE.
IT'S THE CHEMICALS IN YOURDRINKING WATER CAUSE
NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE, YOU GETCRAZY BREAD.
(LAUGHTER)SO TONIGHT I'M GIVING A TIP
OF THE HAT TO CHEVRON.
IT'S THE LEAST THEY COULDDO.
LITERALLY, I THINK IT IS THELEAST THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW IT TURNS OUT, TURNS OUT
THE COUPONS ARE FOR BOBTOWNPIZZA SPECIAL COMBO.
WE AT THE COLBERT REPORTCALLED BOBTOWN PIZZA THIS IS
TRUE.
A SPECIAL COMBO IS A $12VALUE WHICH IS ALSO THE SAME
VALUE OF YOUR LAND ONCECHEVRON IS DONE WITH IT.
(LAUGHTER)AND BONUS, IF THERE'S LEFT
OVER PIZZA THE NEXT MORNING,JUST REHEAT IT IN YOUR SINK.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, I WOULD TAKE THAT DEAL
BECAUSE I HAVE SAID ITBEFORE, I LOVE EATING.
IT'S ONE OF THE TOP THREETHINGS I DO WITH FOOD.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NATION I'M AS STEAMED AS
THE VEGETABLES I WILL NEVEREAT BY THE LATEST OVERREACH
OF THE OBAMA NANNY STATE.
>> A NEW CHANGE ANNOUNCEDTHIS MORNING TO THE
NUTRITION LABELS YOU SEE INGROCERY STORES.
THE FOOD AND DRUGADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING
CHANGES TO THE LABELS FORTHE FIRST TIME IN OVER TWO
DECADES.
>> THE FDA WILL PROPOSELARGER BOLDER TYPE FOR
CALORIES AND FOR THE FIRSTTIME CONSUMER WAS KNOW
WHETHER THEIR FOODS HADADDED SUGAR.
>> CALORIES WILL BE REALLYPROMINENT.
AT A GLANCE YOU CAN SEE THECALORIES BIG AND BOLD.
>> Stephen: NICE TRY BUTTHOSE LABELS ARE NOT BIG AND
BOLD ENOUGH FOR AMERICANS TOREAD THROUGH THEIR EYE FAT.
(LAUGHTER)SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY
FINGER TO THE FDA FORCRAMMING TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE
DOWN MY BRAIN THROAT.
I SAY FOOD LABELS ONLY NEEDTO TELL ME THREE THINGS.
SWEET OR SPICY.
SOFT OR CRUNCHY AND WHICHHOLE DO I STICK IT IN?
(LAUGHTER)OKAY?
AND FOLKS IT JUST GETS WORSE.
>> FOOD LABELS WILL HAVE TOSPELL OUT MORE CLEARLY HOW
SERVING SIZES ARE MEASURED.
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOW WEREALLY EAT FOOD LIKE POTATO
CHIPS AND CANDY BARS.
SERVING SOIZS FOR SODA, FORINSTANCE L GO FROM 8 OUNCES
TO 12 OUNCES.
>> THEY MAY SAY THIS ISTYPICALLY TWO SERVINGS BUT
HERE IS ALSO THE PACKAGEDATA.
>> A BAG OF POTATO CHIPS,FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT'S LIKELY
YOU'RE GOING EAT THE WHOLE BAGIN A SINGLE SITTING THEY
WILL LABEL AS SUCH.
>> OF COURSE I'M GOING TOEAT THE WHOLE BAG IN A SINGLE
SITTING.
WHY DO YOU THINK I SAT DOWN?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DID--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> YOU CAN'T SUDDENLY CHANGE
SERVING SIZES.
THE ONLY THING KEEPING MEFROM POLISHING OFF AN ENTIRE
PINT OF AMERICONE DREAM ISKNOWING THAT IT'S ACTUALLY
FOUR SERVINGS.
OF COURSE I DO EAT THE WHOLETHING BUT AT LEAST I'M
GETTING THREE FULL SERVINGS OFSHAME.
(LAUGHTER)BUT IF THE SAME PINT IS 2
SERVINGS, THAT SHAME WILLKICK IN MUCH LATER AND I
WILL HAVE TO EAT 2 PINTS.
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUSTLABEL EVERYTHING [BLEEP] IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
