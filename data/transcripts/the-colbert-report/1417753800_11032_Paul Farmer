POOR ALL AROUND THE WORLD?
WHY DO THAT?

>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERYGRATIFYING WORK.
IT'S VERY SATISFYING.
FIRST OF ALL-- .
>> Stephen: A LOT OF COIN INTHAT?
A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT?
>> WELL THERE ARE OTHERREWARDS.
WELL, YOU HAVE THE REWARD OFSEEING-- SEEING HOW
EFFECTIVE MEDICINE CAN BE INPUBLIC HEALTH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> AND YOU GET TO USE YOURCOIN METAPHOR, YOU GET MORE
BANG FOR THE BUCK, ACTUALLY,WHEN YOU TURN YOUR ATTENTION
TO PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES AREDAMAGED BY POVERTY, AND
ILLNESS BECAUSE YOU WILL SEETHEY WILL RESPOND WELL TO
INTERVENTIONS THAT AREEASILY AVAILABLE TO US.
IT'S VERY SATISFYING.
>> Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE ABOOK CALLED INFECTIONS AND
INEQUALITIES.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUTINFECTIONS AND INEQUALITIES.
INFECTIONS I UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S MEDICINE STUFF.
BUT INEQUALITY, INEQUALITYSOUNDS LIKE POLITICS.
THAT SOUNDS-- INEQUALITYSOUNDS LIKE ECONOMIC
INEQUALITY, SOCIALISM, HOWARE THEY RELATED TO EACH
OTHER?
>> WELL, I AM REFERRING TOECONOMIC INEQUALITY.
>> Stephen:  IT HAS NOTHING TODO WITH MEDICINE
>> IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DOWITH MEDICINE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOUTALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN'T GET
SICK FROM BEING POOR.
>> YOU KNOW, SOCIALDISPARITIES RANGING FROM
RACISM DEGENERATIVEQUALITIES DO MAKE PEOPLE
SICK.
THEY MAKE PEOPLE SICKDIRECTLY.
BUT THEY PROBABLY MAKE OURSOCIETY SICK AS WELL.
>> Stephen: IS BEING POORCONTAGIOUS?
>> WELL, IN A SENSE IT ISCONTAGIOUS.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU DOSTUDIES OF OBESITY IN AN
AMERICAN CITY, AND YOU WILLSEE THAT THERE IS A SOCIAL
SPREAD OF CERTAINLY-- I AMRELUCTANT TO CALL THEM POOR
HABITS BECAUSE PEOPLE END UPLIVING IN PLACES THAT IT
DON'T HAVE GOOD AND HEALTHYFOOD.
OR DON'T HAVE SAFEENVIRONMENTS.
SO IN THAT SENSE, IT ISCONTAGIOUS.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THEPRESCRIPTION FOR POVERTY?
>> WELL, THE PRESCRIPTIONFOR POVERTY INCLUDES
TRANSFER OF RESOURCES.
LIKE YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEIRMOST SUCCESSFUL AREAS OF
DEVELOPMENT IS-- I MEAN IT'SCAUSED BY A HOKEY NAME.
A CASH TRANSFER, CONDITIONALOR-- .
>> Stephen: THAT'S NOT AHOKEY NAME, THAT IS A
TERRIFYING NAME.
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LOT OFCASH AND YOU WANT MY CASH TO
GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE?
>> WELL, AGAIN, YOU'LL HAVEA BIG RETURN ON THAT
INVESTMENT.
BECAUSE IF YOU-- .
>> Stephen: I GOT A BIGRETURN ON IT RIGHT NOW, MY
FRIEND.
CALLED WALL STREET.
>> WELL, COMPARED TO SOMEOTHER INVESTMENT ON WALL
STREET OR OFF OF IT,INVESTING RESOURCES IN
REALLY POOR FAMILIES, INPOOR COMMUNITIES, LEADS TO
PRETTY RAPID IMPROVEMENT.
AND I THINK THERE'S THEIDEA-- .
>> Stephen: HOW DOES THATHELP ME.
I GIVE MONEY-- I GIVE MYMONEY, IT GOES TO SOME POOR
GUY, YOU KNOW, WHERE, WHEREARE YOU GUYS WORKING?
GIVE ME A PLACE.
>> LIBERIA, SIERRA LEONE.
>> Stephen: SO MY MONEY GOESOVER THERE, HOW IS THAT
HELPING ME?
HOW IS THAT SCRATCHING MYBACK?
>> THERE IS A LOT OFEVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE
WORLD WILL BE SAFER AND MOREPROSPEROUS IF THERE ARE NOT
THESE KIND OF INEQUALITIES,IF WE CAN ADDRESS THEM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE PARTNERS
IN HEALTH HELPED WORLDWIDESO FAR.
>> CUMULATIVELY?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> MANY, MANY MILLIONS, IIMAGINE.
EVEN TENS OF MILLIONS ANDWORKING IN PARTNERSHIP
WITH PUBLIC HEALTHAUTHORITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN
RWANDA.
TO USE THAT EXAMPLE WE'VEBEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO REACH,
YOU KNOW, SIGNIFICANTCOMPONENTS OF THE POPULATION.
AND SEE MASSIVE REVERSALS INMISFORTUNE THAT RWANDA KNEW
ONLY 15 YEARS AGO SO RWANDA,FOR EXAMPLE, IS A COUNTRY
WITH A PRETTY GOODHEALTH-CARE SYSTEM.
AND ALTHOUGH YOUCOULDN'T-- YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE A HEART TRANSPLANTTHERE OR HAVE, YOU KNOW,
CHOOSE TO HAVE YOURMALIGNANCY TREATED THERE, IF
YOU ARE SICK AND ARE IN AVILLAGE, YOU CAN COUNT ON
THAT SYSTEM REACHING YOU.
AND THAT'S ONE OF THEREASONS WHY REDUCTION IN
EARLY MORTALITY HAS BEENMORE STEEPED IN RWANDA THAN
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS WORK?
>> 30 PLUS YEARS.
>> Stephen: AND DO YOU GOYOURSELF TO SOME OF THESE
PLACES AROUND THE WORLD?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: ROUGH PLACES,WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS PLACES YOU'VEBEEN?
IS.
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN IN VERY--PLACES THAT ARE UNSTABLE.
AND SO-- .
>> Stephen: THE HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES?
>> I WAS THERE YESTERDAY.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU REALLY?
>> YEAH
>> Stephen: YOU GOT OUTALIVE.
>> I DID.
AND THEY DIDN'T GET EBOLA.
SO-- I WAS THERE YESTERDAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: DO YOU EVER-- OKAY,
I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, IUNDERSTAND LIKE YOU KNOW
CARING FOR PEOPLE AND I,THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF
WORK I WOULD DO, BUT NEEDLESMAKE ME... ALSO POOR PEOPLE, BUT
DO YOU, DO YOU HAVE LIKE EVEREMPATHY OVERLOAD
AND DO YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF"IF I VACCINATE ONE MORE KID
TODAY," DO YOU EVER GET TIREDOF THIS.
YOU WANT TO PACK IT IN?
WHY ISN'T THERE A HEALTHCRISIS IN ST. BARTS?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY,I MEAN, I THINK ONE DOES GET
TAXED.
AND YOU DO REACH THE LIMITS.
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OFWORKING IN PARTNERSHIP AND
WITH A TEAM.
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYSSOMEONE ON YOUR TEAM WHO IS
NOT TIRED OR OVERWORKED, YOUKNOW, IF IT'S A BIG ENOUGH
TEAM THAT IS THE OTHER GREATTHING ABOUT TEACHING IS YOU
BRING IN VITAL PEOPLE EVERYYEAR INTO THIS WORK SO IT IS A
GREAT WAY TO AVOID BURNOUT.
>> HOW IS THE ORGANIZATIONSUSTAINED?

PRIVATE DONORS, INDIVIDUALS,MOST OF IT IN FACT
