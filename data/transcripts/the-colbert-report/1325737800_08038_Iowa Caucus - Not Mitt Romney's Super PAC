PRIDE AND HOPE.
SADLY, IT WAS A ROUGH NIGHT FOR
NEWT GINGRICH, COMING IN FOURTH
PLACE THANKS TO A BLISTERING
BARRAGE OF NEGATIVE ADS.
IN DECEMBER NEARLY HALF OF ALL
POLITICAL COMMERCIALS IN IOWA
WERE ATTACKS ON NEWT GINGRICH.
IT GOT SO BAD EVEN NON-POLITICAL
ADS WENT AFTER HIM.
♪ I'M LOVING IT
UNLIKE NEWT GINGRICH
♪ WHO LEFT HIS WIFE ♪♪
>> Stephen: NOW, MOST OF THESE
ADS WERE PRODUCED BY THE
PRO-ROMNEY SUPER PAC.
BUT I DON'T BLAME MITT, HE
COULDN'T HAVE STOPPED THE ADS IF
HE WANTED TO.
>> SUPER PACS HAVE TO BE
ENTIRELY SEPARATE OF A CAMPAIGN.
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE
WITH A SUPER PAC IN ANY WAY,
SHAPE OR FORM.
>> SO YOU'RE NOT COORDINATING
WHATSOEVER?
>> IF WE COORDINATE IN ANY WAY
WHATSOEVER, WE GO TO THE BIG
HOUSE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE
BIG HOUSE, THE SLAMMER, THE
GRAY-BAR HOTEL, THE HOOSEGOW,
THE WINDY CITY, MONTEZUMA'S
REVENGE, 23 SKIDOO.
THE POINT IS, IT IS NOT ROMNEY'S
SUPER PAC.
IT IS A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION
FOUNDED BY ROMNEY'S LAWYER, FOR
WHICH ROMNEY HAS PERSONALLY
RAISED MONEY AND THAT IN TURN
HAS SPENT $2.8 MILLION THE
SUPPORT HIM.
TOTALLY SEPARATE.
THE SAME WAY THAT CHANG WAS
SEPARATE FROM ENG.
BUT FOR SOME REASON NEWT
GINGRICH DOES NOT BELIEVE IT.
>> ARE YOU CALLING MITT ROMNEY A
LIAR?
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU'RE CALLING MITT ROMNEY A
LIAR?
>> WELL, YOU SEEM SHOCKED BY IT.
YES.
>> WHY ARE YOU SAYING HE'S A
LIAR?
>> THIS IS MAN WHOSE STAFF
CREATED THE PAC.
HIS MILLIONAIRE FRIENDS FUND THE
PAC.
HE PRETENDS HE HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE PAC.
IT'S BALONEY.
>> Stephen: BALONEY.
THOSE ARE STRONG WORDS COMING
FROM MAN WHO IS ONE-EIGHTH COLD
CUT.
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS AN OLIVE
LOAF.
AND NOW NEWT HAS THE KNIVES OUT
FOR MITT ROMNEY.
LISTEN TO THESE NOT-SO-VEILED
THREATS HE ISSUED LAST NIGHT.
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO OUT
AND RUN NASTY ADS, BUT I DO
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TELL THE
TRUTH.
AND IF THE TRUTH SEEMS NEGATIVE,
THAT MAY BE MORE A COMMENT ON
HIS RECORD THAN IT IS ON
POLITICS.
>> Stephen: OH, MITT, YOU HAVE
MADE A FATAL MISTAKE.
YOU MAY HAVE WOUNDED NEWT.
BUT YOU LEFT HIM ALIVE.
AND ALONE WITH HIS FIRST LOVE --
HATE.
NEWT'S WOUND WILL NOW FESTER,
OOZING A PUSTULENT RAGE WHICH
WILL RENDER DOWN INTO LIQUID
VENGEANCE AND THEN POUR INTO THE
TIP OF A SINGLE HALLOW-NOSED
BULLET AND THEN FIRE INTO THE
HEART OF ROMNEY ROOM'S DREAMS
AND DANCE AND CACKLE ON THE
GRAVE OF YOUR HOPES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT NOT IN A NEGATIVE WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, PERSONALLY I CANNOT WAIT
FOR THIS WEEKEND'S DEBATES IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE WHEN MITT
ROMNEY LEAST EXPECTS IT, NEWT
GINGRICH IS GOING TO TURN TO HIM
AND SAY...
>> HELLO.
MY NAME IS NEWT GINGRICH.
YOU KILLED MY CAMPAIGN.
PREPARE TO DIE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> I THINK THAT MAKES RON PAUL
