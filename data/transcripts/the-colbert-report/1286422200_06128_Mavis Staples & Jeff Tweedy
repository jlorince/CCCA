EVERYBODY.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE A SOUL
LEGEND AND AN INDY ROCK ICON.

LEDGICON.

JEFF TWEEDY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHOO!
THANKS SO MUCH.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO, YOU,
MS. STAPLES, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
YOU'RE A LEGEND OF NOT ONLY
GOSPEL, BUT YOU'VE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR ROCK, SOUL, BLUES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: FOLK.
I'M ASSUMING FUNK.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU FOUND YOUR SOUND
YET?
[LAUGHTER]
WHY WON'T YOU SETTLE DOWN ON ONE
THING AND REALLY TRY THE MAKE A
GO OF IT?
>> YOU KNOW, I LIKE VARIETY.
WHATEVER... I THINK I'VE FOUND
IT NOW.
WITH THIS GUY.
>> Stephen: JEFF, YOU'RE A
FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU FOR WEARING YOUR
FORMAL PLAID SHIRT.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW DID YOU TWO GET TOGETHER?
I MEAN, HOW DO TWO SUCH
DISPARATE TALENTS COME TOGETHER?
IS THERE LIKE A SITE, LIKE
E-HARMONIZE WHERE YOU GET
TOGETHER?
HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
>> I THINK OUR MANAGEMENT WAS IN
CAHOOTS.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT WAS AN
ARRAIGNED MARRIAGE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
WHEN WERE YOU INFORMED, AFTER
THE DEAL WAS SIGNED?
>> I THINK SO.
I WAS TOLD BY MY MANAGEMENT THAT
I MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
HELP MAVIS MAKE A RECORD, AND
SHE WAS TOLD BY HER MANAGEMENT
THAT JEFF TWEEDY WANTED TO HELP
HER MAKE A RECORD.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
>> AFTER WE GOT TO KNOW EACH
OTHER, WE FIGURED IT OUT.
THEY HAD A PLAN.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE BOTH
FROM CHICAGO.
>> WE ARE.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NORTH SIDE.
YOU'RE SOUTH SIDE.
>> I'M SOUTH SIDE.
>> Stephen: WAS THERE ANY
UNCOMFORTABLE LIKE CUBS-SOX
ARGUMENTS DURING ANY OF THAT?
>> NO.
>> IT DIDN'T COME INTO THE
CONVERSATION, BUT I LIKE THE
SOX.
>> Stephen: YOU LIKE THE SOX.
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE CUBS?
MOST CUBS FANS DON'T.
>> I DON'T ARGUE WITH HER ABOUT
ANYTHING.
>> Stephen: NOW, MAVIS, YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY, THE STAPLES
SINGERS, LEGENDARY IN THE WORLD
OF GOSPEL.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS USED TO
OPEN FOR MARTIN LUTHER KING, HIS
SPEECHES AND HIS RALLIES.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU EVER
UPSET YOU DIDN'T GET TOP
BILLING, BECAUSE HE WAS A GREAT
MAN.
HE WAS GREAT MAN, BUT I DOUBT HE
COULD HIT THE HIGH NOTE, RIGHT?
>> HE WAS PRETTY GOOD.
HE WAS PRETTY GOOD WHEN HE HIT
HIS PEAK.
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE WAS... HE
WOULD LET US HAVE TOP BILLING
FROM TIME TO TIME, WHEN WE DOWN
IN MISSISSIPPI, WAY OFF THE MAP.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE THE DRAW?
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: NOW, I'M HAVING A
RALLY.
I'M HAVING A MARCH COMING UP.
WOULD YOU... IF I INVITED YOU,
WOULD YOU BE AT ALL INTERESTED
IN LENDING YOUR CREDIBILITY TO
WHAT I'M DOING?
>> WELL, YEAH.
>> Stephen: ME, NOT JON
STEWART.
>> OF COURSE, TO YOU, YES
INDEED.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, I HAVE NOT INVITED YOU YET.
I HAVE TO CHECK WITH JEFF'S
MANAGER BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
EVIDENTLY.
>> I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK IF
TWEEDY COULD COME.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU KNOW
OF MAVIS' WORK BEFORE YOU DID
THIS?
WAS HER EARLY WORK OR HER SOUL
WORK, WHAT WAS MOST INFLUENTIAL
TO YOU?
>> HER EARLY WORK, THE EARLIEST
RECORDS I THINK WERE PROBABLY
THE MOST... THE MUSIC I LISTENED
TO MOST BEFORE I MET HER.
I DID KNOW THE BAX RECORDS.
I WAS LIKE A RECORD STORE
EMPLOYEE.
YOU REALLY AREN'T WORTH YOUR
SALT UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR
STAPLES SINGERS.
>> Stephen: I NEVER WOULD HAVE
GUESSED YOU WERE A RECORD STORE
EMPLOYEE.
>> CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG.
>> Stephen: WAS IT TOUGH TO
LEAVE GOSPEL TO DO SOUL?
PEOPLE WHO LEFT GOSPEL TO DO
SOUL, WERE THEY OSTRACIZED IN
ANY WAY?
LIKE PEOPLE WEREN'T HAPPY WHEN
SAM COOKE LEFT GOSPEL TO DO
SOUL.
>> NO, THEY SAY YOU'RE SINGING
THE DEVIL'S MUSIC.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU SINGING
THE DEVIL'S MUSIC?
>> I'M POSITIVE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU EVER SING
DISCO?
>> THE DEVIL AINT GOT NO MUSIC.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW.
>> THEY PUT THAT OUT ON ME.
I WASN'T SINGING NO DEVIL'S
MUSIC.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF MUSIC,
YOU'VE GOT A SONG HERE CALLED
"YOU ARE NOT ALONE," WHICH
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN JUST A
MINUTE AFTER THE BREAK.
I HEARD THIS EARLIER TODAY.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S ONE OF THE MORE BEAUTIFUL
SONGS I'VE EVER HEARD.
YOU WROTE THIS?
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: STICK AROUND.
THIS IS AN
