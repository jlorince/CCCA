I PLAYED THAT ALL BY MYSELF.
NOW NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I AM STILL REELING FROM PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY THAT HE IS GAY.
(LAUGHTER) NOW I ASSUME, I HAVE TOO ASSUME, I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IS THE REASON HE
SUPPORTS GAY MARRIAGE.
BUT FOLKS, I AM AN ORIGINALIST.
I BELIEVE THAT GOD ORDER ANSWERED MARRIAGE TO BE BETWEEN ONE MAN AND THAT MAN'S RIB.
NOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE GAY BUT THE RIB GETS TURN ODD INTO A WOMAN SO
EVERYTHING'S JAKE.
SAME REASON WHY IT'S OKAY TO HAVE SEX WITH BARBECUE,
OKAY.
BUT TRY TELLING THAT TO THE CLOSE-MINDED WAIT STAFF AT CHILI'S.
READ THE BIBLE, GUYS.
BUT I AM EQUALLY TROUBLED BY HOW OBAMA CAME TO THIS DECISION.
>> I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH AN EVOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE.
>> FOLKS,
(LAUGHTER)
>> I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT EVOLUTION IS JUST A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO GAY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE CHARTS.
IT GOES MONKEY, CHIMP, BIPED,
CAVEMAN, NEANDERTHAL,
HOMOSAPIEN AND FINALLY HOMOSEXUAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THIS IS A CLEAR ASSAULT ON THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE AND I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT.
SO DOES PASTOR ROBERT JEFFRITZ OF FIRST BAPTIST DALLAS.
>> BY EMBRACING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS REALLY CONTRADICTED THE
JESUS THAT HE SAYS HE FOLLOWS.
>> Stephen: YES, OBAMA IS CONTRADICTING THE JESUS.
(LAUGHTER) AND I RIGHT NOW WOULD LIKE TO READ TO YOU WHAT THE JESUS SAID ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO BUT HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
EVIDENTLY-- EVIDENTLY JESUS WAS SO FILLED WITH RAGE HE WAS SPEECHLESS.
BUT MI CONFIDENT THAT HE CONDEMNED IT ALL THE TIME IN PRIVATE WHEN HE WAS HANGING
OUT WITH THOSE 12 OTHER DUDES AT THEIR ELABORATE DINNER PARTIES WHERE THEY
ALL SAT ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE TABLE.
JUST LIVING THE BACHELOR LIFE TOGETHER, DRINKING
