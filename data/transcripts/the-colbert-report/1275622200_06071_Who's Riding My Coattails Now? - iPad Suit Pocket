>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS.
AS YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO KEEP UP
TO DATE ON THE LATEST NEWS AND
TRENDS, WHICH IS WHY THIS
MORNING I WAS READING LAST
FRIDAY'S THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL."
AND THERE WAS A PIECE ON THE
FRONT PAGE ABOUT A NEW
INNOVATION IN MEN'S FASHION.
IT'S THE iPAD SUIT POCKET.
HERE'S A PHOTO FROM TODAY'S WEB
SITE.
NOW, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE NOW,
AND WHEN YOU'RE THERE, YOU CAN
IGNORE EVERYTHING AROUND YOU BY
PLAYING WITH YOUR iPAD.
BUT THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I
THINK I'VE SEEN THAT iPAD
POCKET SOMEWHERE BEFORE.
WHERE WAS IT AGAIN?
OH, YEAH, ON ME AT THE GRAMMYS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS IS WHO IS RIDING MY
COATTAILS NOW.
THAT WAS AN H.D. GRAPHIC YOU
JUST SAW.
TODAY THEY'RE LITERALLY RIDING
MY COATTAILS.
TO ADD INSULT TO INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY THEFT, THE JOURNAL
DOESN'T EVEN MENTION ME ANYWHERE
IN THIS ARTICLE OR ONLINE, EVEN
THOUGH THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE
JACKET I INVENTED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
IT WORKED IN REHEARSAL.
THIS IS LIKE HAVING AN ARTICLE
ABOUT THE FOUNDING FATHERS BUT
LEAVING OUT WASHINGTON.
OR DOING A PIECE ON FAMOUS TV
TALKING HORSES AND LEAVING OUT
JOHN KERRY.
HEY, HEY, THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL," YOU KNOW WHO THIS SUIT
WOULD LOOK GOOD ON?
MY LAWYER.
HE COULD USE THE POCKET TO HOLD
LEGAL BRIEFS, DAMNING EVIDENCE
AND THEN MY HUGE CASH
SETTLEMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, JOKES ON YOU, "WALL STREET
JOURNAL," BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE
IGNORING MY CONTRIBUTIONS TO
MEN'S FASHION, I INVENTED A NEW
KIND OF POCKET, AND I'VE GOT
SOMETHING IN THERE FOR YOU.
THERE YOU GO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OH, WAIT.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
