I CONDEMN WILLIAM GHEEN FOR ATTACKING MY SENATOR, I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HE'S NOT A HOMOPHOBE.
ACCORDING TO HIS HASTILY THROWN TOGETHER PRESS RELEASE, WILLIAM GHEEN HAS WORKED FOR MULTIPLE
GAY CANDIDATES BEFORE AS A CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT FOR NORTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE
'90s, SO CLEARLY HE HAS A HISTORY OF TOLERATING HOMOSEXUALS WHEN THEY ARE PAYING HIM.
[LAUGHTER]
SO WHY DID HE DO THIS?
THE ANSWER IS TONIGHT'S BONUS WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S OUR FIRST-EVER BONUS WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, FOLKS, A QUICK DISCLAIMER.
THESE DAYS WHEN I GO TWICE A NIGHT...
[LAUGHTER]
...THE SECOND ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUITE THE SAME OOMPH, SO BE GENTLE.
OKAY.
HERE'S WHAT GHEEN IS REALLY DOING.
HE'S A BIG OPPONENT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND THE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL IS THE NEXT BIG
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN OBAMA'S PIPELINE.
NOW, GHEEN KNOWS THE REPUBLICANS ONLY HAVE 41 SEATS IN THE SENATE.
TO BLOCK LEGISLATION, THEY HAVE TO MARCH IN UNISON.
SO THE REAL THREAT IS NOT THE FACT THAT LINDSEY GRAHAM IS TBAI, WHICH HE ISN'T, IT'S THAT
HE'S BI, WHICH HE IS,
BI-PARTISAN.
[LAUGHTER]
RIGHT NOW GRAHAM IS NEGOTIATING A BIPARTISAN DEAL ON THE IMMIGRATION BILL WITH CHUCK SCHUMER.
ALL GHEEN IS SAYING IS THAT NO REPUBLICAN WOULD EVER REALLY BE BIPARTISAN OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.
THERE HAS TO BE A SIMPLER EXPLANATION.
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE LIFE, LINDSAY, BUT AS OUR U.S. SENATOR, I NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHY YOU SELL OUT YOUR COUNTRYMEN.
>> Stephen: SEE, IT MUST BE THAT LINDSEY IS BEING BLACKMAILED INTO BIPARTISANSHIP.
SO GHEEN IS REALLY SETTING HIM FREE.
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF BLACKMAIL, WHATEVER YOU CALL THAT.
THIS, FOLKS, THIS IS A GREAT IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME BECAUSE LATELY THERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO HAVE BEEN BLACKMAILED INTO BIPARTISANSHIP.
FOR INSTANCE, MAINE SENATORS SUSAN COLLINS AND OLYMPIA SNOWE BOTH VOTED FOR OBAMA'S STIMULUS
BILL, AND I HAVE TO WONDER IF SOMEONE IS BLACKMAILING THEM OVER A DARK SECRET.
I MEAN, TWO LADY SENATORS SHARING THE SAME STATE,
STIMULATING EACH OTHER.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT KIND OF REPUBLICANS ARE THOSE?
AND WHAT ABOUT...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND JUST WHAT ABOUT PRETTY BOY SCOTT BROWN?
HE VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATS' JOBS BILL.
I GOT TO ASK, IS THAT BECAUSE SOMEONE IS THREATENING TO RELEASE THE FACT THAT HE'S A TRUCKASEXUAL?
AND WHAT ABOUT CONSERVATIVE WILLIAM GHEEN?
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT HE WORKED WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE 1990s.
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY BIPARTISAN.
I GOT TO AT LEAST CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE FOUND OUT HE GETS OFF BY GOING TO THE
BALLPARK ON WEEKENDS AND LAYING IN A TROUGH IN THE OPINION'S ROOM LIKE A HUMAN URINAL.
I HAVE GOT NOTHING... I GOT NOTHING TO BACK THAT UP.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE.
SO, MR. GHEEN, BI-PARTISAN CURIOUS REPUBLICANS, JUST COME ON MY SHOW.
AIR ALL YOUR DARK SECRETS.
THEN YOU WILL BE FREE TO DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD.
AND THAT'S||||||
