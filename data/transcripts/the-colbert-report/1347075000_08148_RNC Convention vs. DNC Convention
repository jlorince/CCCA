NOW, FOLKS, WITH THE BALLOONS OFFICIALLY DROPPED, CONVENTIONS CAN BE OVER.
CAN KERR AND ROB PORTMAN WILL BE BUBBLE WRAPPED AND RETURN TO DEEP BELOW YUCCA MOUNTAIN.
THE NOMINEES HAVE ALL BEEN NOMINATED.
THE SPEECHES SPOKEN.
THE PAGEANTRY PAGEANTRIFIED.
SO AFTER TWO WEEKS, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?
FOR ANALYSIS OF BOTH CONVENTIONS, WE TURN NOW TO A DIFFERENT CAMERA.
(  LAUGHTER  ) THANKS, STEPHEN.
AN HONOR TO WORK WITH YOU.
FOLKS, WE LEARNED A LOT THESE LAST TWO WEEKS.
FOR INSTANCE, WE LEARNED THAT TWO POLITICAL PARTIES, HISPANICS ARE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD.
(  LAUGHTER  ) BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE LEARNED THAT OBAMA AND ROMNEY ARE AS DIFFERENT AS BLACK AND WHITE.
FOLKS, COME ON-- NO, HEY.
THAT IS NOT RACIAL.
I DON'T SEE RACE.
NOT EVEN MY OWN.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE, AND I BELIEVE THEM, BECAUSE I LIKE MITT ROMNEY.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) SO, I MEAN, I MEAN, THERE ARE CLEAR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS THAT BOTH SIDES
DROVE HOME.
>> YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE CHOICE.
>> WHEN YOU PICK UP THAT BALLOT TO VOTE, YOU WILL FACE THE CLEAREST CHOICE OF ANY TIME IN A GENERATION.
>> Stephen:  YES.
IT'S THE CLEAREST CHOICE A GENERATION SINCE CRYSTAL PEPSI.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ).
( CHEERING ) JUST LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM, THAT TASTES 20 YEARS OLD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, SURE, NOW, SURE, IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WERE SOME THINGS THEY AGREED ON.
>> WEWENT TO BED THAT NIGHT KNOWING WE LIVED IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
( APPLAUSE ).
>> WE ARE TRULY BLESSED TO BE CITIZENS OF THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.
>> I'M ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME TO WALK TOGETHER TO A BETTER FUTURE.
>> OURS IS A FUTURE FILLED WITH HOPE.
>> WHAT AMERICA NEEDS IS JOBS.
>> AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS.
>> NEW JOBS.
>> NEW JOBS.
>> STEVE JOBS.
>> STEVE JOBS.
>> GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> GOD BLESS THESE UNITED STATES.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, WITH THAT MUCH IN COMMON, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THEY CAN STILL DESPISE AND DISTRUST EACH OTHER.
FOLKS, IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THEY AGREE ON THAT DIVIDE US THE MOST.
YOU SEE, THEY AGREE THAT HE CREATED OBAMACARE.
THEY AGREE THAT HE BAILED OUT DETROIT.
THEY AGREE HE PASSED THE STIMULUS.
THAT'S WHERE THE CLEAR CHOICE COMES.
BECAUSE ALL THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IS OUR COUNTRY NEEDED HELP, AND LOOK WHAT BALM DID.
OBAMA  DID.
WELL THE DEMOCRATS KEEP SAYING, OUR COUNTRY NEEDED HELP, AND LOOK WHAT OBAMA DID!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, FOLKS, AND, FOLKS, THAT VAST DISTINCTION MEANS THIS IS NOT JUST THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT INFLECTION OF OUR LIFETIME.
(  LAUGHTER  ) BACK TO YOU, STEPHEN.
THANKS, STEPHEN.
THAT WAS GOOD?
