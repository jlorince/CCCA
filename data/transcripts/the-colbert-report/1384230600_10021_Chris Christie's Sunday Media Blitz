>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY!
THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS.
YOU KNOW AS A VETERAN POLITICALJOURNALIST I HAVE COVERED EVERY
BIG CONTEST IN THE LAST 15YEARS.
BUSH V. GORE, BUSH V. KERRY,KERRY V. PREDATOR.
(LAUGHTER)BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE
POLITICAL HORSE RACE, I AMDISGUSTED WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON
THE SUNDAY SHOWS.
THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONWAS ONLY A YEAR AGO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE MEDIA ISWASTING ITS TIME SPECULATING ON
2016 FRONT-RUNNERS.
AND NEITHER CONDITION K THE 2016FRONT-RUNNER.
CHRIS CHRISTIE APPEARED ON ALLFOUR SUNDAY SHOWS TO TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALKABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
RACE.LAUGH.
>> GOVERNOR, HOW INTERESTED AREYOU IN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN
2016?
>> WELL, CHRIS, WHAT I'MINTERESTED IN DOING IS BEING THE
GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON IS DOING MYJOB IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
I'M THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
FOR ME, I'M THE GOVERNOR OF NEWJERSEY AND MY JOB IS TO RUN THE
STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
>> Stephen: YES, HE'S JUST THEGOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
THAT'S WHY HE WENT ON "MEET THEJERSEY" "FOX NEWS JERSEY SUNDAY"
"FACE THE TURNPIKE" AND "THISNEW JERSEY WITH NEW JERSEY NEW
JERSEYOPOLIS."
(LAUGHTER)AND I ADMIRE HOW DESPITE ALL THE
SPECULATION, CHRISTIE STAYSHUMBLE ABOUT HIS FUTURE BY
BRAGGING ONLY ABOUT HIS PAST.
>> ON GOVERNING IT'S ABOUT DOINGTHINGS, ACCOMPLISHING THINGS,
REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE ANDCRAFTING ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
YOU KNOW, 143, NOW NEW PRIVATESECTORS JOBS.
143,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.
143,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.
143000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.
1423,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTORJOBS.
143,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: WOW!
143,000 TIMES SEVEN MENTIONS ONT.V. EQUALS --
(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY THESESUNDAY SHOWS WON'T JUST LEAVE
CHRIS CHRISTIE ALONE!
I MEAN, THE MAN HAS GOT TO FOCUSON GOVERNING NEW JERSEY WITH
MICHAEL J. FOX AND JIMMY FALLON!
I JUST HOPE HE HAS TIME TORECORD HIS NOT RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT ROBOCALLS.
>> HI, THIS IS CHRIS CHRISTIE.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR ANYTHING,I'M FOCUSED ON BEING GOVERNOR OF
NEW JERSEY.
STOP CALLING ME!
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THESE SORTSOF BELTWAY GAMES.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, BOY, SOMEBODYNEEDS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF
D.C.
CHRISTIE, 2016.
TWO COMPLETELY UNRELATED WORDS.
143,000 JOBS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: OKAY, CABLE NEWS?
