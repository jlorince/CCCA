>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY
GUEST TONIGHT IS A COMMUNITY
ORGANIZER WHO BELIEVES
ANTI-IMMIGRATION IS THE
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR
TIME.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID I
HAVE A DREAM, NOT I WANT A
TACO.
PLEASE WELCOME SCOTT
DOUGLAS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, MR. DOUGLAS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
>> GREAT.
>> Stephen: LET'S TELL THE
PEOPLE A LITTLE ABOUT
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.
YOU ARE THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR OF THE GREATER
BIRMINGHAM MINISTRY'S IN
ALABAMA BIRMINGHAM ALABAMA,
OKAY.
WHICH IS ADVOCATING OVERTURN
OF HB 56.
WHAT IS THIS BILL?
>> HB 56 IS ALABAMA'S NEW
ANTI-IMMIGRANT LAW THAT
BURDENS FAMILIES, BREAKS UP
FAMILIES, FORCES THE SPLIT
UP OF FAMILIES, BURDENS
TAXPAYERS AND MAKES LAW
ENFORCEMENT TAKE ON THE
EXTRA JOB OF CHECKING OUT
PEOPLE AT TRAFFIC STOPS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
I MEAN YOU SAY BURDENS,
SPLITS, WHAT IT DOES IS, IS
THAT IT REMOVES ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS FROM YOUR STATE.
IT IS TOUGH ON CRIME S IT
NOT?
>> THIS LAW-- .
>> Stephen: IS IT A CRIME TO
BE AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT?
>> IT IS-- .
>> Stephen: IS IT A CRIME.
>> IF A FEDERAL CRIME-- NOT
A STATE CRIME.
>> Stephen: OH SO, WE DON'T
WANT THE FEDS MARCHING INTO
ALABAMA.
THEY DID THAT 150 YEARS AGO,
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL.
>> THE PART IS THAT ALABAMA
SHOULD NOT BE JOINING ONE OF
THOSE STATES THAT HAS ITS
OWN STATE IMMIGRANT LAW.
WE DON'T NEED 50 IMMIGRANT
LAWS ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
WE NEED ONE COMPREHENSIVE
LAW THAT IS JUST AND FAIR
FOR EVERYONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS LAW ON THE SHOW A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.
WHAT IT IS, IT SAYS THAT, AN
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CANNOT BE
ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT
WITH.
SO YOU CAN'T RENT THEM.
YOU CAN'T TUSH ON THEIR
WATER IN SOME CASES.
YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM A PHONE.
THEY CAN'T GET A LICENCE.
AND POLICE ARE COMPELLED ON,
IF THEY SUSPECT SOMEONE IS
AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TO PULL
THEM OVER AND ASK FOR I.D.,
CORRECT?
>> POLICE ARE BEING DIVERTED
FROM DOING JOBS OF
PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES
FROM BURGLARIES, SERIOUS
CRIMES, DIVERTED TO POLICING
IMMIGRATION, WITH WHICH IS
NOT IN THEIR PURVIEW AT ALL.
>> Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.
THIS IS DRIVEN, THE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANT HISPANIC FARM
WORKERS OUT OF YOUR STATE,
OKAY.
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT
CROPS ROTTING ON THE VINE AS
A RESULT.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SEE
RACE.
ARE YOU HISPANIC.
>> I AM A PROUD
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND A PROUD
ALABAMAIAN AND PROUD UNITED
STATES CITIZEN.
>> Stephen: SO WHY AS
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WOULD YOU
BE FIGHTING FOR THE LATINOS?
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIGHT
FOR YOU GUYS.
>> THIS IS MY-- THIS IS
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.
>> Stephen: I'M FAMILIAR.
>> AND HE FAMOUSLY SAID THAT
INJUSTICE ANYWHERE WILL
AFFECT JUSTICE EVERYWHERE
AND HB 56 IS A THREAT TO ME
AND ALL AMERICANS.
>> Stephen: LISTEN.
I HAVE COME OUT AGAINST THIS
BILL, OKAY.
BECAUSE IF THE HISPANIC
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT
THERE TO PICK OUR CROPS, I
DON'T GET MY CAESAR SALAD.
OKAY.
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU WANT ME TO
BE AGAINST IT BECAUSE I WANT
JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE
NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME WANT TO
GIVE THEM RIGHTS.
>> THAT'S WHAT MARTIN LUTHER
KING SAID.
THERE'S NO DOCUMENT WRITTEN
BY A HUMAN HAND SHOULD BE
USED TO THE HUMANITY OF ANY
MAN.
AND THIS-- .
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, IF
YOU WANT TO GO, YOU WANT TO
GO OLD SCHOOL ON ME HERE,
OKAY, YOU HAVE SAID I WANT
TO MAKE SURE I GET THIS
WRITE, YOU HAVE SAID THAT
HISPANICS ARE THE NEW NEGRO.
>> YES, BASED ON TREATMENT,
JUST LIKE THE CRIMINAL CROWE
LAWS ARE ARBITRARY LAWS
CAPRICIOUS GIVE ANYBODY THE
POWER OVER YOU TO ABUSE YOU,
TO HURT YOU, TO HONOR YOU.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT ARE THINGS SO GOOD FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALABAMA
THAT THEY'RE NOT IN ANY WAY
THE OLD NEGRO?
I MEAN ARE THINGS SO GOOD
FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN ALABAMA
THAT YOU CAN TURN YOUR FOCUS
TO LATINOS?
>> AFRICAN-AMERICANS CAN
NEVER FORGET HOW HARD WE TO
GAIN THE RIGHTS WE NOW HAVE
AND HOW FAR WE HAVE TO TOIL,
TO GAIN EVEN MORE.
WE KNOW THE PATH WE HAD TO
TROT AND WE ARE TRYING TO BE
IN SOLIDARITY WITH THESE
PEOPLE AS THEY FACE THIS
STAGE OF THIS ABUSE.
>>
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IT JUST SEEMS SO
MANY THINGS, LIKE JAZZ AND
ROCK 'N' ROLL WERE TAKEN
FROM BLACK PEOPLE.
IT'S JUST A SHAME THAT
NEGROS GET TAKEN FROM THEM
TOO.
HOLD ON TO SOME OF THE
HERITAGE.
NOW BACK IN THE DAY
BIRMINGHAM, THE POLICE
BROUGHT OUT THE DOGS AND THE
HOSES ON THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY
THERE.
IF THESE HISPANIC ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY HAD
MASSIVE MARCHES LIKE THE ONE
THAT DR. KING HAD IN ALABAMA
F THEY HAD A LEADER WHO
STOOD UP AGAINST THEM DO YOU
THINK THINGS WILL GET ROUGH
FOR THEM?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THE
POLICE WOULD GO AFTER THEM
LIKE ROUND THEM UP AND LIKE
PEPPER SPRAY THEM, NOT THAT
PEPPER SPRAY WOULD HAVE ANY
EFFECT.
I THINK THAT IS DELICIOUS TO
THOSE GUYS.
NO, I AM-- SERIOUSLY,
THEY'RE RAISED ON THAT
STUFF.
THEY GO RIGHT UP THE STREAM.
DOCTOR, STHOOUCH FOR JOINS
US.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: FROM THE GREATER
BIRMINGHAM MINISTRIES, SCOTT
DOUGLAS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
