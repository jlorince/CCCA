WELCOME BACK. FOLKS, I'M A BIGFAN, THANK YOU.
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THEPENTAGON'S PROGRAM OF GIVING
SURPLUS MILITARY GEAR TOLOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KEEPTHE PEACE IN THE UNSTABLE
TRIBAL REGION OF SUBURBANST. LOUIS.
BUT SOME FOLKS SAY POLICEDEPARTMENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE
ALL THESE EQUIPMENT AND IAGREE BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE
GOING TO OUR SCHOOLS.
>> NEW CONTROVERSY TONIGHTOVER THIS MILITARY GRADE
ARMORED VEHICLE NOW IN THEHANDS OF SAN DIEGO UNIFIED
SCHOOL DISTRICT SCHOOLDISTRICT.
>> HEY, THE SAN DIEGO SCHOOLDISTRICT NEEDS THAT MRAP TO
DEFEND ITSELF IN CASE LOSANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET
GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
WHICH THEY DID.
BESIDES, AS THE SAN DIEGOSCHOOL DISTRICT POLICE CHIEF
EXPLAINED, IT'S NOT AS SCARYAS IT LOOKS.
>> THERE WILL BE MEDICALSUPPLIES IN THE VEHICLE.
THERE WILL BE TEDDY BEARS INTHE VEHICLE.
>> Stephen: WHAT A VALUABLELIFE LESSON, KIDS, WHEN YOU
SEE AN URBAN MILITARY STRIKEVEHICLE, RUN TOWARDS IT FOR
THE FREE TEDDY BEARS.
AND THE DISTRICT, THEDISTRICT HAS TAKEN GREAT
PAINS TO MAKE SURE THE MRAPDOES NOT SCARE THE KIDS.
SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOLDISTRICT IS GOING TO ENLIST
ITS SHOP CLASS TO GIVE IT APAINT JOB, SEE?
NOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE AMINE RESISTANT AMBUSH
PROTECTED AMBULANCE.
ONLY THIS ONE DOESN'T NEED ASIREN BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST
DRIVE RIGHT OVER THE TRAFFIC.
FOLKS, I SAY THIS IS HOW WECAN REASSURE EVERYONE ABOUT
HAVING MILITARY VEHICLESROLLING DOWN MAIN STREET
AMERICA.
BECAUSE AS HARMLESS AS THISMRAP LOOKS HERE IT COULD
LOOK EVEN MORE HARMLESSER.
I SAY WE MOUNT A GIANT HOTDOG ON THE ROOF.
NOW IT'S NO LONGER AN 18 TONARMOURED MILITARY TRANSPORT,
IT IS JUST THE OSCAR MEYERASSAULT WEINER.
OR EVEN BETTER, PEOPLE LOVEIT.
PEOPLE LOVE IT.
OR EVEN BETTER, WE ATTACH ASPEAKER TO THE TOP AND PLAY
MUSIC TO TURN IT INTO AN ICECREAM TRUCK.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, ICECREAM, YOU SCREAM, WE ALL
SCREAM WHEN THIS THING COMESDOWN THE STREET.
