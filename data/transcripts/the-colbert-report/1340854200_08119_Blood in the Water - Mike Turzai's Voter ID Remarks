VOTE.
( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, FOLKS, WITH AN ELECTION THIS TIGHT, WHAT'S
REALLY GOING TO DECIDE IT IS VOTER TURNOUT IN SWING STATES.
THAT'S WHY OFFICIALS MUST STAY VIGILANT AGAINST VOTER FRAUD.
THANKFULLY, REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FRAUD WITH
VOTER I.D. LAWS, PEN OPINION PASSED A VOTEO REQUIRING VOTERS TO SHOW A PHOTO I.D., OR FOR THE
AMISH, TWO NOTARIZED FORMS OF MULE.
IT'S NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.
PENNSYLVANIA HAS HAD A SHOCKING "NO DOCUMENTED CASES OF IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD."
ZERO EVIDENCE.
THEY WERE THAT GOOD.
( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, THE SHARKS IN THE LAME STREAM MEDIA HAVE CALLED VOTER I.D. LAWS A SCHEME TO
DISENFRANCHISE LOW-INCOME AND ELDERLY VOTERS.
THEY HAVE SUNK THEIR JAWS INTO AN INNOCENT VICTIM BECAUSE THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
>> SHARK, SHARK SHARK, SHARK, SHARK.
SHARK.
>> Stephen:  TONIGHT'S CHUM DU JOUR IS PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AND KEEPER OF
AMERICA'S STRATEGIC FOREHEAD RESERVE, MIKE TURZAI.
NOW, TURZAI HAS BEEN IN THE CENTER OF A FEEDING FRENZY EVER SINCE HE BRAGGED ABOUT THIS
LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENT.
>> VOTER I.D., WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO WIN THE
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, DONE.
>> Stephen:  WOW!
THERE IT IS, FOLKS.
HE'S GOING TO WIN BECAUSE OF VOTER I.D.
THAT'S THE G.O.P. GAME PLAN FOR THIS ELECTION.
>> HE JUST SAID-- AND I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD-- WE'RE REALLY ABOUT
PARTISAN GAIN, ABOUT THE PURSUIT OF POWER.
>> THESE NEW LAWS MAKING IT HARD TORE VOTE REQUIRE GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO
I.D. CARDS AND OTHER MOVES ARE AIMED AT GETTING ROMNEY OTHER AND REPUBLICANS ELECTED.
HE BLEW THE COVER.
HE ADMIT THE THE WHOLE SCHEME WAS TO WIN.
>> Stephen:  WHAT!
THE POINT OF POLITICS IS TO WIN?
NO ONE TELL CHRIS MATH USE WHERE BABIES COME FROM.
HE STILL THINKS HIS PARENTS FOUND HIM IN A POTATO PATCH.
( LAUGHTER ).
BESIDES,-- ( APPLAUSE ) AND I BELIEVE THEM.
BESIDES, AS A G.O.P. SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED, REPRESENTATIVE TURZAI WAS SPEAKING AT A PARTISAN
POLITICAL EVENT-- EXACTLY.
IT WAS A PRIVATE GATHERING.
PARTISAN POLITICIANS CAN SAY THOSE THINGS TO EACH OTHER AND IT'S NOT OFFENSIVE.
THE SAME WAY THAT BLACK PEOPLE CAN SAY TO EACH OTHER, "I BELIEVE WE'RE BEING
DISENFRANCHISED, "  WHY O.
OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT LAUGH SO STOP CIRCLING TURZAI, SHARKS.
YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS GUY.
HE'S JUST TRYING TO ELECT A GREAT WHITE.
( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
