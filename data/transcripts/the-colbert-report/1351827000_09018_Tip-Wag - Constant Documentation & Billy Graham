THEY WORE DENIM, EVERYWHERE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, IF YOU WATCHED THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.
I MAKE CONCLUSIONS COME TO ME.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, THERE IS NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN TAKING PICTURES WITH MY iPHONE.
IT IS SO CONVENIENT.
WHEN I WAS A KID WE HAD TO DUCT TAPE A POLAROID CAMERA TO OUR ROTARY PHONE.
BONUS T HELD 20 SONGS IF YOU ALSO HOT GLUED A RECORD PLAYER TO IT.
AND THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS LITTLE TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL IS THAT IT ALLOWS ME TO DOCUMENT MY LIFE WREFER I GO
FROM CONCERTS TO FAMILY GATHERINGS, TO SPONTANEOUS ERUPTIONS OF APPLAUSE FOR FROM MY STUDIO AUDIENCE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW LUCKY I HAVE THIS THING.
SADLY, EVEN WITH MY iPHONE THERE ARE STILL MEMORABLE MOMENTS THAT I MISS.
WELL, A SWEDISH COMPANY HAS CREATED A NEW DEVICE THAT WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.
>> SOMETIMES THE BEST MOMENTS IN LIFE ARE THE SIMPLE ONES SO WE STARTED THINKING IF WE COULD BUILD A
CAMERA SMALL ENOUGH TO NEVER BE IN THE WAY AND SMART ENOUGH TO CAPTURE LIFE AS WE LIVE IT.
THIS IS WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH.
THE MEMOTO LIFE LOG CAMERA.
JUST CLIP IT ON AND IT STARTS TAKING PICTURES AND ALL THE PICTURES ARE SAFELY STORED ON MEMOTO'S STORAGE SURFACE.
>> Stephen: AT LAST.
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN BUYING PRINTER TONER AT STAPLES OR PAIRING MY SOCKS AND THOUGHT
WHY AM I NOT CAPTURING THIS ON FILM.
MOMENTS GONE FOREVER.
SO FOLKS, A TIP OF MY HAT TO CONSTANT DOCUMENTATION.
FINALLY SOMEONE HAS MADE A WEARABLE CAMERA THAT AUTOMATICALLY TAKES A PICTURE EVERY 30 SECONDS.
IF I HAD THIS A YEAR AGO I COULD HAVE CAPTURED THE BEGINNING AND END OF TIM PAWLENTY'S CAMPAIGN IN TWO PICTURES.
(APPLAUSE) FOLKS-- FOLKS, I LOVE THIS LITTLE DEVICE.
OR AT LEAST I WILL LOVE IT WHEN I EVENTUALLY SEE PICTURES OF MYSELF HAVING LOVED IT.
SO WHY LIMIT MYSELF TO JUST MY LIFE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING GET MEMOTOS FOR ALL MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY SO THEY CAN CAPTURE THE REAL ACTION, ME.
NOW THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I DON'T THINK A-- THINK A PICTURE EVERY 30 SECONDS IS ENOUGH.
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY TO VISUALLY EXPERIENCE MY LIFE IN REALTIME.
GET ON IT, APPLE.
WHERE'S MY II, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FIVE YEARS.
NEXT UP ON TIPS OF THE WIZ EL, THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION PUNDITS HAVE WONDERED WHETHER MITT ROMNEY'S FAITH
COULD HURT HIS CHANCES.
>> WE KNOW FROM EXTENSIVE POLLING AS WELL AS AN DECK-- ANECDOTALLY AND CULTURALLY THAT EVANGELICAL
DOES DO NOT FAVOR A MORMON CANDIDATE.
>> FOR A LOT OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS, THEY DIDN'T CONSIDER MORMONISM EVEN CHRISTIANITY.
>> Stephen: OF COURSE, HOW CAN IT BE CHRISTIANITY IF IT IS NOT TELEVISED WITH AN 800 NUMBER.
SO TO COUNTSER THIS PROBLEM, ROMNEY HAS APPEALED TO THE REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM, AN EVANGELICAL TITAN AND
RELIGIOUS ADVISOR TO 12 PRESIDENTS.
ONE MORE AND HE GETS A FREE FOOT LONG IN HEAVEN.
BUT FOLKS THERE IS A CATCH.
BILLY GRAHAM'S OWN WEB SITE LISTS MORMONISM AS A CULT ALONG WITH JEHOVAH WITNESS, SCIENTOLOGIST AND UNITARIANS.
OH YES, THE DANG JUST-- DANGEROUS CULT OF UNITARIANISM, THEIR RULES ARE SO LOOSE THAT THEIR TLE SACRED FIXES ARE THE OLD
TESTAMENT, THE NEW TESTAMENT AND FREE TO BE YOU AND ME.
(APPLAUSE) SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A MIRACLE HAS OCCURRED FOR MITT.
BECAUSE WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE DELETABLE.
>> A MEETING WITH MITT ROMNEY SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED EVANGELIST BILLY GRAHAM VIEW OF MORMONS, HE REMOVED
REFERENCES TO MORMONISM AS A CULT AFTER MEETING WITH HIM.
>> ROMNEY TOOK SOME TIME IN NORTH CAROLINA TO VISIT BILLY GRAHAM.
GRAHAM TOLD ROMNEY THAT WILL DO, QUOTE, ALL I CAN TO HELP ROMNEY WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> THOUGH IN FAIRNESS THE 93-YEAR-OLD GRAHAM HAS SAID THE SAME THING TO HIS COATRACK.
SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO THE REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM FOR DISENCULTFEWING MORE MONDAYISM.
FOLK, I AGREE, BILLY GRAHAM'S WEB SITE DEFINITION OF CULT SAYS THEY ARE THOSE BELIEF SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT
ADHERE SOLELY TO THE 66 BOOKS OF THE BIBLE AS THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD.
AND ADD THEIR SPECIAL REVELATIONS TO THE BIBLE.
WELL, FOLK, THE BOOK OF MORMON ISN'T A SPECIAL REVELATION.
IT IS JESUS FAN FICTION.
RIGHT AFTER JESUS COMES TO AMERICA TO PREACH TO THE INDIANS, HE AND EDWARD CULLEN BAPTIZE DUMBLEDORE.
BUT GREAT, GRIPPING, GRIPPING.
BUT THE BIGGEST REASON MORMONS ARE NO LONGER A CULT IS THAT NOW A MORMON MIGHT BEAT OBAMA.
AND THAT IS GREAT NEWS FOR OTHER CULTS.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE RECLASSIFIED AS A LEGIT MASS-- LEGIT MAT RELIGION BY BILLY GRAHAM IS BE A VIABLE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.
SORRY RON PAUL FANS, YOU'RE STILL A CULT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT SCIENTOLOGISTS, YOU CAN GET OFF THE LIST AS SOON AS YOUR GALACTIC OVERLORD XENU WINS THE IOWA STRAW POLL.
AFTER ALL, CRAZIER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
