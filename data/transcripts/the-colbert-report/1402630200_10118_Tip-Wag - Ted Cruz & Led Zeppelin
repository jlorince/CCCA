NATION, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION,THERE'S NOTHING HUMBLE ABOUT MY
OPINION.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OFTHE FINGER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]FIRST UP, FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET
THAT I HAVE ALWAYS FELT A DEEPCONNECTION WITH TEXAS SENATOR
AND JOE McCARTHY TRIBUTE HEADTED CRUZ.
[LAUGHTER]THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT SENATOR
CRUZ THAT BOTHERS ME.
IT'S HIS NAME, RAFAEL EDWARDCRUZ.
IT SOUNDS KIND OF, YOU KNOW,CANADIAN.
[LAUGHTER]IT TURNS OUT I HAVE EXCELLENT
CANADAR.
>> SENATOR TED CRUZ HASRENOUNCED HIS CANADIAN
CITIZENSHIP.
THE TEXAS REPUBLICAN WAS BORNNORTH OF THE BORDER.
HE DISCOVERED HE HELD DUALSHIPLAST YEAR.
>> TED CRUZ NOW OFFICIALLYALL-AMERICAN, SHEDDING HIS
CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP.
>> Stephen: SO A TIP OF THEHAT TO SENATOR CRUZ FOR HIS
GREAT SHOW OF PATRIOTISM.
IF YOU ASK ME, THERE'S NOTHINGMORE AMERICAN THAN NOT BEING
FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY.
WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO HARD FOR METO ALSO GIVE TED CRUZ A WAG OF
MY FINGER, BECAUSE THE WAY TEDCRUZ WENT ABOUT BECOMING A
NOT-CANADIAN WAS SO CANADIAN.
HIS CANA-DECTOMY WAS PERFORMEDWITH A SIMPLE CERTIFICATE OF
RENUNCIATION ISSUED BY THEGOVERNMENT.
A CERTIFICATE JUST SAYING HE'SNOT CANADIAN.
HELL, I GOT THOSE.
THE PRINTER IN MY OFFICE CHURNS'EM OUT 24/7.
I EVEN GOT A TWO-PLY VERSION INTHE BATHROOM.
COME ON, SENATOR, NO PIECE OFPAPER CAN WIPE THE CANADA OFF
YOU.
I'VE VISITED TORONTO ONCE 20YEARS AGO AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
I STILL SAY I'M SORRY.
NO, TO BECOME 100% AMERICAN, TEDCRUZ NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING
RADICALLY UNCANADIAN.
HE NEEDS PUNCH A MOOSE OR PAYFOR HIS OWN HEALTH CARE.
AND I CAN HELP.
I CAN HELP.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I'M HERE TO HELP BECAUSE I'M A
TRAINED LUDOVICO THERAPIST.
I'VE ADMINISTERED CANADIANDEPROGRAMMING BEFORE.
JIM?
[SCREAMING]♪ IT'S BEEN ONE WEEK YOU LOOKED
AT ME♪ DROPPED YOUR ARMS TO YOUR
SIDES AND SAID I'M SORRY>> STOP IT! THIS IS SICK!
>> Stephen: NOW THANKS TOCONDITIONING, EVERY TIME HE
HEARS CELINE DION, HE BECOMESNAUSEOUS, LIKE A TRUE AMERICAN.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM A HUGE FANOF LED ZEPPELIN.
I AM A SUCKER FOR THEIR UNIQUEMIX OF BLUES, ROCK AND DRUIDS,
WHICH IS WHY I AM SO ANGRY.
JIM.
>> IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK'N' ROLL SONGS OF ALL TIME, BUT
WAS THE INTRO TO LED ZEPPELIN'S"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN" STOLEN FROM
THE 1960s BAND SPIRIT?
ACCORDING TO AN ATTORNEY FORSPIRIT'S FORMER LEAD GUITARIST,
THE ZEPPELIN CLASSIC SOUNDSSTRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO SPIRIT'S
SONG "TAURUS."
>> Stephen: LED ZEPPELINIS BEING ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING
"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN" 43 YEARSAFTER IT CAME OUT. THE
PLAINTIFF NEEDED TIME TO LISTENTO IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE'60s ROCK BAND SPIRIT, IT'S
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WERE NEVERIN THE '60s ROCK BAND SPIRIT.
BUT THE ESTATE OF THEIR LEADSINGER RANDY CALIFORNIA,
SEEN HERE, LOOKING LIKE THAT,CLAIMS THAT LED ZEPPELIN
RIPPED HIM OFF. YOU DECIDE.
HERE'S LED ZEPPELIN'S "STAIRWAYTO HEAVEN."
♪♪ ♪♪
[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]
NOW HERE'S SPIRIT'S SONG"TAURUS."
♪♪I DON'T KNOW WHAT LEGALLY
CONSTITUTES PLAGIARISM, ALL IKNOW IS THAT THEY BOTH MADE ME
WANT TO COUPLE'S SKATE.
[LAUGHTER]SO I HAVE NO CHOICE TO GIVE A
WAG OF MY THINGER TO MY FORMERHEROES, LED ZEPPELIN.
I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING,MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE HARDON ZEP?
WELL GREG, EAT HOT FACT.
>> TAURUS WAS RELEASED IN1968 THREE YEARS BEFORE
"STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN." JIMMYPAIGE SAYS
HE WROTE IT IN A COTTAGE INWALES BACK IN 1970. BUT A LAWYER
REPRESENTING RANDY CALIFORNIA,WHOSE BAND TOURED WITH
LED ZEPPELIN IN 1969, SAYS PAIGESTOLE THE OPENING RIFF.
>> Stephen: AND IF THAT WASN'TENOUGH, PAIGE ALSO APPARENTLY
STOLE THE NECK FROM ONE OFSPIRIT'S GUITARS.
WELL, THIS "COMMUNICATIONBREAKDOWN" HAS LEFT ME "DAZED
AND CONFUSED."
IT'S A REAL "HEARTBREAKER,"BECAUSE I HAD A "WHOLE
LOTTA LOVE" FOR ZEP.
BUT "HEY, HEY, WHAT CANI DO?"
IN HERE, THE "LEVEE HAS BROKEN,""BLACK DOG."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NO LONGER...
NO LONGER WILL I CELEBRATESEPTEMBER AS ZEPTEMBER.
I'LL HAVE TO MAKE DO WITHROCTOBER, TULLVEMBER, STONESUARY
AND BARCH.
[LAUGHTER]SO, ZEP, THAT'S IT.
INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO YOU, I'MGOING TO LISTEN TO SPIRIT'S "12
DREAMS OF DOCTOR SARDONICUS."
♪♪ ♪♪
[LAUGHTER]OH YEAH,.
OH, YEAH, I'M EVENTUALLY GOINGTO GET INTO THIS.
JIMMY, CRANK IT UP.
NOW CRANK IT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW JUST CRANK IT OFF.
[LAUGHTER]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
