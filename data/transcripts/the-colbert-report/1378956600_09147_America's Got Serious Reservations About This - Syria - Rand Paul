LET'S GET THEREPUBLICAN RESPONSE FROM SENATOR
RAND PAUL WHO MADE THE ROUNDS ONTHE CABLE NEWS SHOWS LAST NIGHT
AFTER FIRST DELIVERING THETRADITIONAL "STATE OF THE RAND"
SPEECH.
PAUL HAS BEEN OPPOSED TOMILITARY ACTION IN THE BEGINNING
AND WAS THRILLED BY RUSSIA'SDIPLOMATIC PROPOSAL.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TRUSTTHE PROPOSAL OR NOT.
THE QUESTION IS ARE THEYSERIOUS?
CAN WE TRUST THE PARTICIPANTS INTHIS PLAN?
>> Stephen:  RIGHT, YOU CAN'TALWAYS TRUST.
FOR INSTANCE, THAT THING ON YOURHEAD, YOU ASSURE US IT'S HAIR
BUT I HAVE YET TO BE CONVINCEDIT'S NOT A SLUM BERG WOMBAT
READY TO STRIKE IT'S ANY TIME.
I AGREE WITH RAND PAUL-- WECANNOT TRUST RUSSIA OR SYRIA.
WE SHIPMENT DO ANYTHING.
>> THE VIOLATION OF EVERY NORMFOR SOMEONE TO KILL CIVILIANS,
AND I THINK ASSAD SHOULD BEACCOUNTABLE.
>> Stephen:  ABSOLUTE, GOT TOHOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE, OTHERWISE,
WHAT ARE WE AS AINATION,NOT-HOLD-ACCOUNTABLE-STAN.
I AGREE WITH RAND PAUL-- NO, JIMESH THE SECOND RAND PAUL, OKAY.
WE MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLEWITH THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN OF
LIMITED STRIKES, SEND A MESSAGE.
>> THEY HAVE SAID THE WAR WILLBE UNBELIEVABLY SMALL AND
LIMITED.
TO ME THAT SOUND LIKE THEY AREPREANNOUNCING THAT THE MILITARY
STRIKES WILL NOT PUNISH ASSADIMPORTANTLY OR EFFECT REGIME
CHANGE.
>> I THINK ASSAD DESERVES DEATHFOR THIS.
>> REGIME CHANGE, SHOCK AND AWE,BOMBS AWAY.
>> FING WE BOMB ASSAD IT WILL BEMORE LIKELY THE COUNTRIES
BECOMESES MORE UNSTABLE.
>> Stephen:  I WAS WRONG.
THIS IS THE RAND PAUL I AGREEWITH BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT-- IF
WE TAKE UP ON THE THE GUY WHOGASES CHILDREN, SOMEBODY BAD
MIGHT TAKE OVER.
SO JUST TO RECAP-- RAND PAULSAYS NO DIPLOMACY, CAN'T DO
NOTHING, BUT NO TO THEPRESIDENT'S PLAN, AND NO TO
REGIME CHANGE.
( LAUGHTER )I MEAN, TAKEN ALL TOGETHER
THAT'S REALLY... CALMYOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT SURE HOW I WOULDDESCRIBE RAND PAUL'S RESPONSE TO
THE PRESIDENT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, RAND PAUL, HOWWOULD YOU DESCRIBE RAND PAUL?
>> I THINK HE'S BEEN A LITTLEBIT HERE AIR, LITTLE BIT THERE,
AND A LITTLE BIT EVERYWHERE.
I DON'T THINK HE MAKES ANYSENSE.
>> Stephen:  YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU COULD NOT HAVE SAID ITBETTER YOURSELF.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
