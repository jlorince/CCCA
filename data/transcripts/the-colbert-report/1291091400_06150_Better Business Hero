THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
NATION, I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,
BUT I LIKE TO THINK I MADE MY
LITTLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS
COUNTRY.
LAST YEAR I DECLARED VICTORY IN
THE IRAQ WAR.
THIS YEAR I SAVED THE UNITED
STATES OLYMPIC TEAM.
AND MOST RECENTLY I BROUGHT BACK
THE JUMPSUIT AND CAPE.
FOLKS, I HAVE DONE IT AGAIN.
YOU SEE, BEFORE THE BREAK I
TALKED WITH BARRY FOX, THE
PRESIDENT OF MARBLE KING,
AMERICA'S ONLY MARBLE
MANUFACTURER, AND I SAID THIS, "
IF I CAN JUST ENCOURAGE THE
CHILDREN OUT THERE, THIS IS A
FUN, ONLY MILDLY CHOKING HAZARD
GAME.
PLAY MARBLES."
>> YES, PLAY MARBLES.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAVING
AMERICAN JOBS.
NOT TO MENTION FEEDING TONS OF
HUNGRY, HUNGRY HIPPOS.
SINCE MS. FOX WAS ON MY SHOW,
MARBLE KIN BUSINESS HAS GONE
THROUGH THE ROOF.
SHE'S GOTTEN SO MUCH MAIL,
THEY'VE HAD TO UPGRADE THEIR WEB
SITE FOUR TIME, INCLUDING
HUNDREDS OF NEW ORDERS.
MARKELL KING IS MAKING SO MUCH
CASH, HE MAY SOON BE ABLE TO
AFFORD A GRANITE TOUPEE INSTEAD
OF THAT COMBOVER.
AND THIS SMALL BUSINESS IS SO
HOT THAT MS. FOX IS GOING TO BE
ON THE MARTHA STEWART SHOW THIS
WEEK.
I WONDER HOW MARTHA DISCOVERED
HER.
JIMMY, WHO WAS MY OTHER GUEST
THE DAY MS. FOX WAS ON THE SHOW?
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS MARTHA
STEWART.
NOW, I KNEW THEY'D GET ALONG,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
BECAUSE MS. FOX'S COLD, LIFELESS
MARBLES PERFECTLY MATCHED
MARTHA'S EYES.
NATION -- THAT'S FOR COMING ON,
MARTHA -- NATION, I HAVE
SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVED AMERICAN
MANUFACTURING, AND I WILL NOT
STOP AT MARBLES.
MARK MY WORDS, THE NEXT HOT
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IS TOYS
YOUR GRAND FARE PLAYED WITH
DURING THE DEPRESSION.
TAKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT AND
SINK IT INTO HOOP AND STICK
FUTURES.
SEE.
LOOK HOW FUN THIS.
IS HOOP AND STICK.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
OR, JACK, OR, JACK, I DON'T HAVE
ANY [BLEEPED] JACKS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
JACKS ARE GREAT ININVESTMENT
SCHEME.
HERE'S HOW I'M GOING TO MAKE
MONEY.
I'M GOING TO BUY UP THE THREE
Zs, BUNDLE THEM WITH TWO Zs
AND SHORT SELL THEM AS FIVSIE
DERIVATIVES.
BUT FIRST THING, I'M THROWING
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT INTO BALL
AND CUP.
FOLKS, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NEW
INTERNET RIGHT HERE.
IT CAN'T MISS.
IT IS A SLAM... IT IS A SLAM.
IT IS A SLAM... IT IS A SLAM...
