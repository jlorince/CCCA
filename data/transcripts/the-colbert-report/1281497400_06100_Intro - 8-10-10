>> Stephen: TONIGHT, SHOULD WE
ALTER THE CONSTITUTION OR JUST
PUT SOME ELASTIC IN THE WAIST?
THEN I NAME MY ALPHA DOG OF THE
WEEK.
HE'LL SNIFF YOUR CROTCH AND NOT
EVEN CALL IT THE NEXT DAY.
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS MY GUEST TONIGHT IS MSNBC
HOST DYLAN RATIGAN.
WAIT!
IF HE'S HERE, THEN WHO'S
WATCHING MSNBC?
VAN HALEN WILL RELEASE A NEW
ALBUM WITH DAVID LEE ROTH.
AT THEIR AGE, "HOT FOR TEACHER"
