>> STEPHEN: YEAH, YEAH.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE,
OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD
AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA,
NATION, THE B.P. OIL LEAK IS NOW
OFFICIALLY THE WORST ECOLOGICAL
DISASTER IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
IT IS THE BIGGEST BRITISH MESS
TO HILT OUR SHORES SINCE AMY
WINEHOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST
STAINING OUR SHORELINES, IT'S
STRAINING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
GREAT BRITAIN.
JIM.
>> THE FOLKS IN ENGLAND ARE
PRETTY STEAMED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
BRITISH PETROLEUM IS CATCHING SO
MUCH HEAT FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION.
>> THE FALLOUT FROM THE OIL
SPILL BECAME TRANS-ATLANTIC.
OBAMA KILLING ALL OUR PENSIONS.
BACK OFF, OBAMA.
>> THE WAR OF WORDS HEATING UP
BETWEEN AMERICA AND ENGLAND.
>> STEPHEN: YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS HEATING UP?
OUR PELICANS' EYEBALLS, BUT THEY
ARE OUR ALLY, SO I AM OFFERING
OUR ENGLISH FRIENDS AN OLIVE
BRANCH.
JIMMIE, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE "RULE
BRITTANIA."
♪ RULE BRITANNIA ♪♪
AND HOW ABOUT SOME VIDEO TO MAKE
THE ENGLISH HAPPY.
OH, SCOOOOOOOOOOOORE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALA-SUCK
-IT, ENGLAND!
WE KICKED YOUR ARSES, 1-1.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, TO BE FAIR, BRITISH, I KNOW
YOU ARE DOING YOUR BEST TO KEEP
THE OIL OFF OF OUR SHORELINES,
BUT YOU WILL FAIL MISERABLY.
I MEAN, HOW CAN I PUT IT ANOTHER
WAY?
LET'S JUST SAY THE OIL WAS BALL
AND OUR COASTLINE WAS A
GOOOOOOOAL!
GOOOOOOOAL!
AND I KNOW THAT B.P.'S STOCK HAS
FALLEN 40% IN VALUE AND THAT THE
COMPANY'S DIVIDENDS AMOUNT TO
ONE-SIXTH OF BRITAIN'S PENSION
FUNDS, BUT I DON'T GIVE A FLYING
SHEPHERD'S PIE.
WHAT ABOUT OUR PENSIONERS?
YOUR OIL HAS WASHED UP ON
FLORIDA, AND IT'S GETTING ON MY
PEE-POP.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN THERE
AND SCRUB HIM WITH DISHWASHING
LIQUID.
AND ALL THOSE BUBBLES CONFUSE
HIM.
HE THINKS HE'S ON THE "LAWRENCE
WELK SHOW."
AMERICA, I AM DRAWING A LINE IN
THE SAND, IN THE BLACK,
FLAMMABLE SAND.
IT IS TIME TO BRING IT TO THESE
LIMEY BASTARDS, SO FROM NOW ON,
ENGLISH MUFFINS ARE NOW FREEDOM
MUFFINS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND BRIT HUME IS NOW FREE HUME.
YOU'RE WELCOME, FREE.
AT LEAST UNTIL THIS OIL THING IS
FIXED.
THEN WE WILL REESTABLISH OUR
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, BECAUSE
AFTER ALL, LET'S NOT FORGET THE
U.S. AND ENGLAND HAVE LONG BEEN
ALLIES, AND THEY SHARE THE SAME
MILITARY AND ECONOMIC
GOOOOOOOOOALS!
>> AUDIENCE: U-S-A, U-S-A,
U-S-A, U-S-A,
