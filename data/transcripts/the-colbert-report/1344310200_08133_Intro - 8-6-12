STEEFNLT TONIGHT A CHICKEN SANDWICH TEARS THE NATION APART WHICH IS STILL BETTER THAN WHAT
IS DONE TO THE CHICKEN.
HAD OF LAUGH THEN, A CONGRESSMAN TAKES A SURPRISING STANCE ON ANIMAL RIGHTS.
THERE'S NOWHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS A DOG CAN'T PLAY BASKETBALL.
MY GUEST IS LEGENDARY FOLK SINGER PETE SEEGE RIRKS.
I HAVE A HAMMER AND I'M GOING TO NAIL HIM IN THE EVENING.
