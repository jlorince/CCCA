( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
WHOOO!
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN" ).
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
NATION, NATION, AMERICA
TRAGICALLY CONTINUES TO FALL
BEHIND THE CHINESE.
IT SEEMS LIKE NO MATTER WHAT WE
DO, THEY STAY 13 HOURS AHEAD.
( LAUGHTER )
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON,
INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE?
AND MY GUEST TONIGHT, AMY CHUA,
AND I HOPE I'M MISPRONOUNCING
THAT CORRECTLY, KNOWS EXACTLY
WHO IS TO BLAME FOR WHAT IS
WRONG WITH AMERICA -- MOM.
JIM.
>> WHY CHINESE MOTHERS ARE
SUPERIOR.
THAT'S WHAT THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL" PUT OVER PERTS FROM THE
MEMOIRS OF AMY CHUA, WHO CALLS
HERSELF A TIGER MOTHER.
>> AMY CHUA DOESN'T BELIEVE IN
PLAY DATES AND SLEEPOVERS.
SHE EVEN THREATENED TO BURN HER
DAUGHTER'S STUFFED ANIMALS IF
SHE DIDN'T PLAY THE PIANO
CORRECTLY.
>> Stephen: IF SHE'S BURNING
STUFFED ANIMAL, I THINK IT'S
PROBABLY BEST THE KIDS DON'T
SLEEP OVER.
IN HER DEFENSE, MS. CHUA SAYS
HER BOOK, "THE BATTLE HYMN OF
THE TIGER MOTHER" HAS BEEN COME
POLLUTELY MISINTERPRETED.
BY THE WAY, KIDS, IT IS A GREAT
READ, AND YOUR BOOK REPORT IS
DUE IN AN HOUR OR I'M GOING TO
SELL YOU TO THE GYPSIES.
NOW... GOT TO MOTIVATE THEM.
TOUGH LOVE.
NOW, I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED, I'VE
ALWAYS BELIEVED MOMS ALONE
DETERMINE HOW OUR KIDS TURN OUT.
COULDN'T BE DADS.
WE'RE NEVER.
THERE HANDS ARE CLEAN.
NOW, NO FINGERPRINTS.
NOW, MS. CHUA POINTS OUT WHERE
WESTERN MOTHERS HAVE IT ALL
WRONG, WRITING, "IF A CHILD
COMES HOME WITH AN A MINUS ON A
TEST, A WESTERN PARENT WILL MOST
LIKELY PRAISE THE PARENT.
THE CHINESE MOTHER WILL GASP IN
HORROR AND ASK WHAT WENT WRONG.
IF A CHINESE CHILD GETS A B,
WHICH WOULD NEVER HAPPEN, THERE
WOULD FIRST BE A SCREAMING,
HAIR-TEARING EXPLOSION.
IF THEY GET AN F, THEY BECOME
PART OF THE BODIES EXHIBIT.
THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THE
BODIES.
I ALWAYS WONDERED.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, THIS BOOK HAS UPSET A FEW
PEOPLE, INCLUDING "NEW YORK
TIMES" COLUMNIST DAVID BROOKS,
WHO SAYS CHUA'S PARENTING STYLE
SHORT CHANGES KIDS.
"PRACTICING A PIECE OF MUSIC FOR
FOUR HOURS IS NOWHERE NEAR AS
COGNITIVELY DEMANDING AS A
SLEEPOVER WITH 14-YEAR-OLDS.
( LAUGHTER )
A TRENCHANT OBSERVATION ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERPERSONAL
DYNAMIC, WHICH HAS SPARKED THE
QUESTION: WHY DOES DAVID BROOKS
KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT SLEEPOVERS
WITH 14-YEAR-OLD GIRLS?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, I WILL LET MS. CHUA RESPOND
TO THE CRITICISM IN JUST A BIT,
SO STAY TUNED.
TO ANY CHILDREN OF TIGER MOMS
OUT THERE WATCHING, WHAT THE
HELL ARE YOU DOING WATCHING TV?
WHAT IF SHE CATCHES YOU?
