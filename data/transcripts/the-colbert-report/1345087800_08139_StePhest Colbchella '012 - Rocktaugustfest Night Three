AVAST, YE SWABS!
WELCOME TO NIGHT THREE OF PEPSI PRESENTS: STEPHEST COLBCHELLA '012: ROCKTAUGUSTFEST!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, MY FRIENDS, OH, MY FRIENDS,
IT'S BEEN A GREAT FIRST TWO DAYS BUT TONIGHT, TONIGHT, SANTIGOLD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT, A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT
TO THANK THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS POSSIBLE.
IF BY PEOPLE YOU MEAN CORPORATIONS-- AND I USUALLY DO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE GOOD PEOPLE AT PEPSI.
NOW, I KNOW THAT... ANYBODY WANT TO THROW ME A PEPSI?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) NOW, I KNOW... NOW I KNOW THE SUITS AND THE SQUARES OUT THERE
DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS SORT OF TALK, BUT I ENJOY THE PRODUCTS MARKETED BY THE GLOBAL SNACK
BEVERAGE COMPANY PEPSICO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SUCK ON THAT, THE MAN.
(CROWD CHANTING "PEPSI") NOW, FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS A THREAT OF STORMS COMING IN,
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT LIGHTNING STRIKES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU ARE IN THE SAFEST
POSSIBLE PLACE-- ON THE STEEL BECK OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHICH I HAVE HAD COATED WITH TEFLON SO IN CASE YOU GET FRIED
IT'S EASY CLEANUP.
WE'LL JUST HOSE YOU OFF INTO THE HUDSON.
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN BECAUSE FOR YOUR SAFETY TONIGHT I HAVE INSTALLED A LIGHTNING ROD.
COME ON OUT HERE JAY THE INTERN.
JAY, COME ON OUT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HI, JAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS SAFE?
>> Stephen: IT'S ABSOLUTELY SAFE JAY.
NOW, RAISE YOUR COPPER SAFETY WAND.
(LAUGHTER) LITTLE HIGHER.
HIGHER, PLEASE.
THERE YOU GO.
NOW, JUST STAND THERE AND PRETEND THAT YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S CHECK IN WITH MY GOOD FRIEND
STEPHEN COLBERT ON THE BRIDGE OF THE "INTREPID." STEPHEN, ARE YOU THERE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
