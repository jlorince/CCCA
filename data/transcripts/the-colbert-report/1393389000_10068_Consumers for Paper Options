WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKSSO MUCH.
NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,BUT IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE THESE
DAYS IN THIS FAST-PACED DIGITALWORLD, WHERE KIDS ARE
INSTAGRAMMING, IT'S NICE TO KNOWSOME PATRIOTS ARE FIGHTING TO
HOLD ON TO A WAY OF LIFE YOU CANACTUALLY HOLD ON TO.
ONE SUCH GROUP IS CALLEDCONSUMERS FOR PAPER OPTIONS, AND
THEY'VE BEEN DOING MEDIAOUTREACH, POLLING, AND LOBBYING
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO MAKE ASIMPLY-- DON'T MOVE AWAY FROM
PAPER SO QUICKLY. YES, WHO DOESN'T WANT TO
PRESERVE THEJOY OF GOVERNMENT PAPER WORK,
THE FEELING OF FULFILLMENT WHEN YOU FILL OUT THE
VS-1723 FOR THE IMPORTATION OFPERSONALLY OWNED PET BIRDS.
OR THE PRIDE THAT COMES WITHFILLING OUT THE FORM TO REPORT
THE THEFT AND LOSS OF EXPLOSIVEMATERIALS.
PERSONALLY, I THINK THE BIRDTOOK THEM.
HE'S FOREIGN AND YET SPEAKSPERFECT ENGLISH.
COME ON, POLLY WANTS SOME C4.
AND THE CONSUMERS FOR PAPER OPGSKNOW THEIR STUFF BECAUSE THEY
WERE SET UP BY THE ENVELOPEMANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION.
THAT'S THE ENVELOPEMANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
PUSHING THE "PUSHING THEENVELOPE" ENVELOPE
SINCE 1933.
( LAUGHTER )SURE, ENVELOPE MANUFACTURERS
MIGHT PROFIT FROM THE GOVERNMENTSEND, LETTERS TO EVERY HUMAN IN
AMERICA.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'REWRONG, FOLKS.
AND, YET, THE TREASURYDEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT BY
SHIFTING FROM PAPER TO DIGITALTHEY WOULD SAVE $1 BILLION OVER
THE NEXT 10 YEARS, BUT THEN WHATARE THEY GOING TO PRINT THOSE $1
BILLION BILLS ON?
PAPER.
WHERE IS YOUR SAVINGS NOW?
AND WHERE DOES THIS PAPERLESSMENACE END?
FIRST THEY TAKE OUR PAPERWORK.
WHAT'S NEXT, OUR LIQUID PAPER?
( LAUGHTER )PRETTY SOON THEY'LL COME FOR OUR
TOILET PAPER, AND I, FOR ONE,DON'T WANT TO USE SOMETHING
DIGITAL TO CLEAN MY ANALOG.
( LAUGHTER )THE POINT IS--
( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT DIDN'TDESERVE APPLAUSE BECAUSE IT DID.
( LAUGHTER )THE POINT IS, THERE'S NOTHING
SUSPICIOUS WITH THIS OR THE FACTTHAT MY SHOW IS SPONSORED BY THE
NATIONAL STAMP MOISTENINGSPONGE ASSOCIATION.
STAMP MOISTENING SPONGES FORWHEN YOU DON'T GIVE A SPIT.
AND THIS HAS IN NO WAYINFLUENCED MY OBJECTIVE, ONGOING
SERIES, "SELF-ADHESIVES, THESTAMP OF DEATH."
FOLKS, THE SELF-ADHESIVE STAMPIS A DEATH TRAP.
KIDS MISTAKE ONE FOR A REALSTAMP, LICK IT, THE ADHESIVE
STICKS TO THE TONGUE.
SUDDENLY THE KID IS CHOKING TODEATH ON A FOREVER STAMP.
FOR HIM, FOREVER IS ONLY APRECIOUS FEW SECONDS.
( LAUGHTER )BUT DO YOUR PART TO PRESERVE
TRADITIONAL AMERICA BY JOININGTHE MOVEMENT TO BAN
SELF-ADHESIVE STAMPS.
WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMAN TODAY.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, JUSTE-MAIL THEM.
IT'S A LOT EASIER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
