LET'S TURN TO A LIGHTERSTORY.
CHILD REFUGEES.
(LAUGHTER)NATION, I COME TO YOU
TONIGHT WITH A HEAVY HEARTAND A BLOATED LIVER.
YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DRINKINGA LOT THINKING ABOUT THIS
WAVE OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORSFLOODING INTO AMERICA,
FLEEING HONDURAS, GUATEMALAAND I BELIEVE EL DIABLO.
(LAUGHTER)SADLY, FOLKS, THESE KIDS
CONTINUE TO STREAM IN OVERTHE BORDER DESPITE OUR
CLEARLY MARKED YOU MUST BETHIS TALL TO ENTER THE
COUNTRY SIGN.
THIS IS A CLEAR HUMANITARIANCRISIS.
I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUTSOMETHING HERE.
I AM A HUMAN.
I'M NOT A MONSTER.
I CARE FOR THESE KIDS SOVERY PUBLICLY.
(LAUGHTER)YES, I BELIEVE IN SECURING
OUR BORDERS BUT SOME OF MYBEST FRIENDS ARE GUATEMALAN.
(LAUGHTER)THEY'RE SMALL CHEERFUL
PEOPLE.
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONEWEARING MY HEART ON MY TV
SLEEVE.
>> I FEEL BAD, AS I SAID, IFI WAS IN SOUTH OR CENTRAL
AMERICA, MEXICO I WOULD TRYTO GET HERE.
IT'S NOT THE IMMIGRANT'SFAULT.
>> BROKEN HEARTED.
WE ALL REALLY FEEL BADFOR THESE KIDS.
>> I'VE BEEN IN CENTRALAMERICA MANY TIMES.
I HAVE A GUATEMALAN DAUGHTER,NOW AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
I SPEAK SPANISH.
I LOVE THE LATIN AMERICANPEOPLE.
>> Stephen: I TOO HAVE ADEEP LOVE FOR THE LATIN
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
I MEAN THESE KIDS AREN'TJUST INVADING OUR COUNTRY,
THEY'RE INVADING-- IN HERE.
AND WITH OUR HEARTS FULL OFLOVE FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN
PEOPLE, IT'S CLEAR WHAT WEMUST DO --
>> FIRST THING YOU DO ISSTART DEPORTING PEOPLE, TO
THE BY THE HUNDREDS, NOT BYTHE DOZENS, BY THE THOUSANDS.
>> Stephen: IT'S UH --(APPLAUSE)
IT'S A TOUGH LOVE.
(LAUGHTER)OR A VERY SOFT HATE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING,
IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING LET ITGO.
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,SEND HEAVILY ARMED TROOPS TO
SCARE IT AWAY.
NOW SURE, LAST WEEK OBAMADEPORTED 38 WOMEN AND
CHILDREN BACK TO SAN PEDRO,HONDURAS, THE CITY WITH THE
HIGHEST MURDER RATE IN THEWORLD.
IT'S A GOOD START, DON'T GETME WRONG.
BUT 38 PEOPLE OUT OF 5200?
I MEAN AT THAT RATE, FOLKS,WE WILL NOT GET THESE-- WE
WILL NOT GET THESE IMMIGRANTSOUT OF HERE UNTIL-- WAIT A
SECOND THIS CALCULATOR ISN'TIN SPANISH.
(LAUGHTER)IT DOESN'T-- IT DOESN'T HAVE
THE-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE SPANISH ONES HAVE THATUPSIDE DOWN PLUS SIGN.
AND FOLKS, EVEN A TROOPSURGE CANNOT STOP THESE KIDS
BECAUSE THEY ARE SURGING ATOUR TROOPS.
>> SO MANY OF THESE KIDS WHOAPPROACH THE BORDER, THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR BORDER AGENTS TOTURN THEMSELVES IN, SO THEY
CAN START THIS NOW LENGTHYLEGAL PROCESS OF TRYING TO
STAY IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> THESE KIDS ARE TURNINGTHEMSELVES INTO THE TROOPS.
THAT'S LIKE HAVING MORECUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AT THE
BORDER.
>> Stephen: YEAH, IT'S LIKEHAVING CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS
AT THE BORDER.
THOUGH IF THEY'RE FROMCOMCAST THOSE KIDS MIGHT BEG
TO BE LET GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: AND I SAY-- I
SAY-- INSTEAD OF US SENDINGTROOPS DOWN THERE, WE JUST
DO WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU RUNOUT OF CANDY ON HALLOWEEN.
LESS'S TURN OFF THE LIGHTSAND PRETEND AMERICA'S NOT
HOME.
(LAUGHTER)SO THE KIDS MOVE ON TO THE
NEXT HOUSE, CANADA.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I HOPE THOSE KIDS LIKEPENNIES AND RAISINS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FOLKS, THE WORST PART OF
THIS CRISIS IS WHERE THEOBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS
DECIDED TO SEND SOME OFTHESE ILLEGAL CHILDREN.
>> A VERY DISTURBING REPORTABOUT HOW THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLYSPENDING MILLIONS OF YOUR
HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS TOHOUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT
A TEXAS HOTEL.
PLANS TO PUT ILLEGALS UPINSIDE A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR
RESORT HOTEL AND WE'REPAYING FOR IT.
>> THE BEAUTIFUL PALM AIRERESORT AND HOTEL IN
McALLEN TEXAS OFFERINGINDOOR, OUTDOOR POOLS, WIFI
CABLE, SAUNA, STEAM, FITNESSCENTER.
>> IT'S GOT THREE POOLS, ATENNIS COURT, JACUZZI,
WIFI, WAS THAT ANAPPROPRIATE PROPOSAL, DO YOU
THINK, TO TRY AND HOUSESOME OF THESE KIDS?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
>> OH, I AGREE.
OH, LET'S ALL PAY FORPABLO'S CONTINENTAL
BREAKFAST.
(LAUGHTER)I BET EVERY NIGHT ON THE
PILLOW THEY LEAVE A MINT, AGREEN CARD AND IMMIGRATION
PAPERS FOLDED INTO A SWAN.
(LAUGHTER)JUST LISTEN, JUST LISTEN,
THIS IS GOING TO SHOCK YOU.
(APPLAUSE)THIS IS GOING TO SHOCK YOU.
JUST LISTEN TO THESE ACTUALREVIEWS OF THE PALM AIRE
RESORT FROM TRIP ADVISOR.
ONE STAR, TERRIBLE HOTEL.
MOLD AND MUSTY.
SUNKEN COACH, BROKEN HANDLEON SHOWER.
STAINED SHEETS.
THE POOL WAS GREEN.
THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL IHAVE EVER STAYED IN.
I DISCOVERED LARGECOCKROACHES RIGHT AS I
ENTERED THE ROOM.
THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE EVENGIVING THE KIDS PETS.
(LAUGHTER)THE BOTTOM LINE-- BOTTOM
LINE, WE LOVE THESE KIDS.
AND THE WORST HOTEL IN THEWORLD IS STILL TOO GOOD FOR
THEM.
'CAUSE THESE INNOCENT LOOKINGCHILDREN ARE ANYTHING BUT.
>> I'M TELLING YOU YOURSAFETY IS AT RISK AND YOU
ARE IN DANGER.
>> THEY COULD BE MEMBERS OFGANGS, FOR ALL WE KNOW.
>> WE'VE GOT PEOPLE COMINGFROM COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S
A LOT OF CRIME.
>> WE KNOW THAT WE'REGETTING MORE THAN WE'VE EVER
GOTTEN FROM COUNTRIES WHERETHERE IS ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
>> Stephen: I THINK THATMEANS THEY'RE ISLAMIC
TERRORISTS.
I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT, ITMAKES SENSE.
CHILDREN TAKE NAPS IN THESEDETENTION FACILITIES.
THEY'RE LITERALLY IN SLEEPERCELLS.
(LAUGHTER)AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN I WANT
TO POINT OUT, I'M NOT AMONSTER.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THESECHILDREN.
THEY'RE NOT ALL VICIOUSKILLERS.
SOME OF THEM ARE MERELYFILTHY DISEASE CARRIERS.
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SUREOF THEIR HEALTH CARE STATUS.
WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUTTB AND MRSA.
>> WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHATALL DISEASES THEY HAVE.
>> SEXUALLY TRANSMITTEDDISEASES, THEY WILL GIVE IT
TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
>> GEORGIA REPUBLICANCONGRESSMAN PHIL GINGREY IS
RAISING HEALTH CONCERNSABOUT THE CHILDREN AS WELL.
IN A LETTER TO THE CENTERSTO DISEASE CONTROL AND
PREVENTION HE CITES CONCERNSABOUT SWINE FLU, EBOLA VIRUS
AN TUBERCULOSIS.
>> YES, ACTUAL DOCTOR ANREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN PHIL
GINGREY SAYS THESE KIDSCOULD BE CARRYING EBOLA.
AND YES THAT VIRUS HASNEVER APPEARED OUTSIDE OF
AFRICA, BUT GINGREY MAY HAVECAUGHT IT FROM AN ILLEGAL
ALREADY BECAUSE I BELIEVEONE OF THE SYMPTOMS IS
BASELESS FEAR LEAKING OUT OFYOUR ASS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THANK GOD--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THANK GOD THAT
PATRIOTS ALL OVER THECOUNTRY HAVE TAKEN TO THE
STREETS TO PROTEST THESERABID-PLAGUED CHILDREN BEING
SPREAD BY OBAMA LIKEFESTERING STOOL SAMPLES
ACROSS THE PETRI DISH OFAMERICA.
AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, I LOVETHEM.
(LAUGHTER)ONE SUCH PATRIOT IS ARIZONA
REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSIONAL
CANDIDATE AND HUMAN STUBBLEFARM ADAM KWASMAN WHO SHOWED
UP WITH CAMERAS TO BLOCKADEBUSES OF ILLEGAL CHILDREN
OUT OF PURE VIDEOTAPEDCONCERN FOR THEIR
WELL-BEING.
>> REPUBLICAN ADAM KWASMANWAS IN AURICLE THIS MORNING
IN PROTEST THE BUSING OFMIGRANTS TO THE SHELTER.
>> I WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLYSEE SOME OF THE CHILDREN IN
THE BUSES, IN THE FEAR ONTHEIR FACES.
THIS IS NOT COMPASSION.
>> JUST ONE PROBLEM, THOSEWEREN'T MIGRANT CHILDREN ON
THE YELLOW SCHOOL BUS.
THEY WERE YMCA CAMPERS FROMTHE MIRANA SCHOOL DISTRICT.
>> DID YOU KNOW THE BUS WASYMCA KIDS?
>> THEY WERE SAD TOO. IAPOLOGIZE.
>> DO NOT APOLOGIZE!
>> Stephen: DO NOT APOLOGIZE.
(APPLAUSE)STAND STRONG.
I FOR ONE NEVER TRUSTCAMPERS.
THINK ABOUT IT, THEY ARESENT TO REMOTE LOCATIONS
WHERE THEY ARE TRAINED TOUSE DEADLY WEAPONS SO THEY
CAN CAPTURE OUR FLAGS.
VIGILANCE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
