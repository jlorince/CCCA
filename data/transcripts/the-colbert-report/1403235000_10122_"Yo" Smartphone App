>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, YOU KNOW, YOU READ THEPAPERS, YOU KNOW THAT WE
AMERICANS LIVE IN ANUNPRECEDENTED ERA OF
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, FROMTABLETS TO SMARTPHONES TO
FUTURISTIC GLASSES THATINSTANTLY SEND THE MESSAGE,
I'M A DOUCHE.
NOW THERE'S A NEW APP THAT HASEXPANDED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR
COMMUNICATION BY DRASTICALLYREDUCING THEM.
>> THERE'S A NEW SMARTPHONE APPSIMPLY CALLED YO. USERS CONNECT
WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE FREEAPP AND PUSH ONE BUTTON TO
SEND THE WORD YO TO A CONTACT.
SO FAR, 50,000 USERS HAVE SENTABOUT FOUR MILLION YO'S.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, YO,AN APP ALREADY HUGELY POPULAR
WITH THE WORLD'S POPULATION OFSYLVESTER STALLONE.
NOW, WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUTAN APP THAT BOILS DOWN ALL YOUR
COMMUNICATION INTO TWO LETTERS,I EXPRESSED MYSELF IN ONE.
Y?
( APPLAUSE )BUT I JOINED--
( CHEERS )I JOINED THE YO-TH MOVEMENT WHEN
I READ THE COMPANY BOASTS ITTAKES 11 TAPS TO SEND THE WORD
YO ON A RIVAL MESSAGING SERVICECOMPARED TO TWO ON THEIR APP.
THAT'S A NINE-TAP DIFFERENCEDIFFERENCE.
TAPS YOU COULD BE SPENDING WITHYOUR CHILDREN.
( LAUGHTER )BUT THE TRUE BEAUTY OF ONLY
SAYING YO IS IT SAYS SO MUCH.
AS ITS DEVELOPER PUTS IT WE LIKETO CALL IT CONTEXT-BASED
MESSAGING.
YOU UNDERSTAND BY THE CONTEXTWHAT IS BEING SAID.
CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.
IN THE OLD DAYS IF I TEXTEDSOMEONE THE WORD YO, AND I
WANTED THEM TO KNOW WHAT ITMEANT, I HAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH
GURT.
AND YO IS ALSO GOOD FORBUSINESS.
FOR INSTANCE, AN ICE CREAM TRUCKCAN YO THE KIDS WHEN ITS
AROUND THE CORNER.
IMAGINE GETTING A YO FROM THEICE CREAM TRUCK, AND PARENTS CAN
SIGN UP TO TELL THEIR KIDS TOSTAY AWAY FROM ANYONE WITH THE
USER NAME "THEICECREAMTRUCK."
BUT WHY ARE THEY LIMITING THISBREAKTHROUGH TO JUST OUR PHONES?
I BELIEVE WE CAN IMPLEMENT YO'SCONTEXT-BASED COMMUNICATION
PHILOSOPHY IN EVERYDAY LIFE.
COME ON OUT, JAY.
JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YO.
