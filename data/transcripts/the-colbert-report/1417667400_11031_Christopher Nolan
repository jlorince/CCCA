[LAUGHING]>> Stephen: DRESSED AS BIG MAMA
FANTASTIC.
INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE.
OKAY.
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS"INTERSTELLAR THING"
THIS IS I BELIEVE A TROJAN HORSEFOR SCIENCE.
THE WHOLE POINT FOR THE PEOPLEWHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT TELL THEM
WHAT HAPPENS.
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT ANDDON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE TRAVELING OUTIN SPACE TO FIND A NEW HOME,
RIGHT?
>> IT IS. IT'S ABOUT
ABOUT A POTENTIAL MOMENT INHUMAN DEVELOPMENT.
MAYBE THE NEXT STEP IN HUMANEVOLUTION.
>> Stephen: EARTH IS IN BADSHAPE IN THE MOVIE.
>> YES THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHERPLANET TO SUSTAIN HUMAN LIFE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S MY FIRSTQUESTION HERE.
THE MOST HOPEFUL THING AT THEBEGINNING OF THE MOVIE IS THAT
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ABANDON OURPLANET.
[LAUGHING]>> Stephen: THAT'S THE GOOD
NEWS.
WE MAY SCRAPE THE DIRT OF THISTHING OFF OF OUR BOOTS AND GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP ON THE EARTH.
>> I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON THEEARTH.
>> Stephen: YOUR HEROES DO.
>> MY HEROES DO?
IT'S NOT THE QUESTION OF GIVINGUP ON THE EARTH AS MUCH AS
HAVING FAITH IN HUMANITY. THEOPTIMISM IN
THE FILM IS PERHAPS HUMANITY MAYNEED YOU IN THE FUTURE OR
IS CAPABLE OF EXISTINGINDEPENDENTLY OF THE EARTH.
MAY HAVE A GREATER PLACE OUTTHERE IN THE UNIVERSE.
THE UNIVERSE IS AN INCREDIBLY VAST PLACE.
>> Stephen: IT'S BIG TOO.
REALLY BIG.
>> IT'S VERY BIG.
Stephen: YES.
>> MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER PLACESFOR US TO LIVE.
>> Stephen: IS IT GLOBAL WARMINGOR CLIMATE CHANGE?
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE EARTHHERE?
>> WHAT'S HAPPENED ISAGRICULTURAL BLIGHT.
Stephen: AGRICULTURAL BLIGHT?
>> YES CROPS ARE DYING.
CORN IS ALL THAT'S LEFT.
>> Stephen: WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
I JUST NEED MY CORN CHIPS ANDHIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LIVING ONAND MAKING A LIFE AND ADAPTING
AS HUMANS DO.
THAT'S COMING TO AN END.
YOU KNOW WE BASE THE END OF THEWORLD SCENARIO ON THINGS THAT
HAVE HAPPENED.
PEOPLE ARE GIVING TESTIMONIALSAT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW.
THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE.
WE DREW IT FROM KEN BURNSDOCUMENTARY ON THE DUST BOWL.
THAT'S A SCIENCE FICTION FILMBUT I WANTED THE FEELING OF
DREAD AND IMBALANCE TO THEPLANET TO BE REAL AND CREDIBLE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ELSE CAN WE SAYWITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY.
THERE ARE EXTRAORDINARY THINGSIN THE MOVIE. THE MOVIE, I
HAVEN'T SEEN A MOVIE LIKE THISBEFORE.
LET'S TAKE A LITTLE CLIP HERE.THIS'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF
THE PART THAT IS THE BLOW UPPART.
THE PART THAT IS THE BLOW UPPART.
>> COOPER THERE IS NO POINT INUSING OUR FUEL TO--
>> ANALYZE THE ENDURANCE.
>> COOPER WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> DOCKING.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> LAST QUESTION.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHINGAWAY IN THE MOVIE.
ARE WE HAPPENING NOW OR IS THISWATCHING OURSELVES IN THE PAST?
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT.
DO YOU BELIEVE ALL TIME ISHAPPENING AT ONCE?
>> I BELIEVE IF YOU ARE CAPABLEOF LIVING IN A FIVE-DIMENSIONAL
WORLD AND YOU'RE A FIFTHDIMENSIONAL CREATURE VIEWING
TIME AS A DIMENSION IT WOULDHAVE TO BE REWRITTEN.
>> Stephen: YOU DID NOT ANSWERMY QUESTION.
