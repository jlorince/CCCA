"STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
FOR JOINING US.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I AM TEMPTED
TO KEEP YOU PEOPLE FROM
CHANTING, BUT THEN I THINK, WHY
WASTE YOUR BREATH MOANING?
NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO STOP THE
SHOUTING.
NATION, THANK YOU FOR PICKING ME
UP WITH THAT CHEERING, BECAUSE
THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT A DARK
TIME FOR AMERICA.
PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S NIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT ALSO BECAUSE THIS MORNING
AMERICA'S MANNED SPACE PROGRAM
CAME TO AN END WHEN THE SHUTTLE
"ATLANTIS" TOUCHED DOWN FOR THE
LAST TIME.
THANKS, OBAMA.
[LAUGHTER]
GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR BUMMER.
[LAUGHTER]
REQUEST PERMISSION TO DOCK WITH
A BOX OF TISSUES.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: FOLKS, AMERICA HAS
ALWAYS BEEN THE LEADER IN SPACE.
FROM THE HISTORIC 1969 MOON
LANDING TO THE LANDMARK
200940th ANNIVERSARY OF THE
MOON LANDING.
IN BETWEEN WE USED OUR SHUTTLE
FLEET TO BUILD THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION, LAUNCH THE HUBBLE
TELESCOPE AND DEPLOY A RAGTAG
BAND OF OILMEN TO SAVE THE EARTH
FROM A KILLER ASTEROID.
NOW WITHOUT OUR SHUTTLE FLEET,
WE'RE STUCK HITCHING RIDES WITH
THE DAMN RUSKIES, AND SINCE THEY
DON'T HAVE ANY COMPETITION NOW,
THE PRICE IS SHOOTING UP LIKE AN
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE CANCELED
THE SPACE PROGRAM.
THE COSMO-NAZIS STARTED OFF
CHARGING $22 MILLION PER
ASTRONAUT.
BUT NOW SUDDENLY IT'S $43.4
MILLION, AND IT'S GOING TO GO UP
TO $63 MILLION BY 2016.
AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE
THE $25 BAGGAGE FEE.
[LAUGHTER]
I AM ON TO YOU.
IT MAY WEIGH 50 POUNDS DOWN
HERE, BUT IN SPACE IT'S
T-p[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH!
YEAH!
AND, FOLKS, THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT THE END OF AMERICA'S SPACE
DOMINANCE.
IT'S REALLY ABOUT ME.
[LAUGHTER]
I WAS HUGE IN SPACE.
I LAUNCHED A A WRISTSTRONG
BRACELET INTO SPACE.
I GOT A TREADMILL NAMED AFTER
ME.
I WENT TO NASA, FINISHED THE
ENTIRE ASTRONAUT TRAINING
REGIMENT IN ABOUT TWO HOURS.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT MY ASTRONAUT SKILLS ARE NOW
AS OBSOLETE AS DOUGHER -- DODO
HUSBANDRY, Z UNE PROGRAMING AND
U.S. MANUFACTURING.
BUT TAKE HEART, NATION, BECAUSE
I KNOW SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
TONIGHT A YOUNG CHILD IS LOOKING
UP AT THE STARS AND DARING TO
DREAM THAT ONE DAY HE TOO CAN
PAY THE RUSSIANS $63 MILLION.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUS
