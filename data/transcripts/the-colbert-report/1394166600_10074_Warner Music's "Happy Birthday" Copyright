>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,NATION. LIKE EVERYBODY,
I JUST LOVE BIRTHDAYS,ESPECIALLY MY OWN.
I CAN REMEMBER THEM ALL-- FROMLAST YEAR WHEN MY WIFE TREATED
ME TO BREAKFAST IN BED, ALL THEWAY BACK TO THAT VERY SPECIAL
DAY IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN IARRIVED KICKING, SCREAMING, AND
COVERED IN GOO.
AH, TO BE 30 AGAIN.
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE CELEBRATE AVERY SPECIAL BIRTHDAY BECAUSE
THE SONG "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" TURNS90 YEARS OLD.
AND I AM GOING TO WISH HAPPYBIRTHDAY A FESTIVE ANNUAL AGE
INCREASE THE WAY YOU WOULD ANY90-YEAR-OLD BY SINGING A SONG
THAT REMINDS THEM WHAT THEIRNAME IS.
HAAAPPPYYY.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SORRY ABOUT THAT, FOLKS.
IT TURNS OUT YOU CANNOT SINGHAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HAPPY
BIRTHDAY, EVEN ON HAPPYBIRTHDAY'S HAPPY BIRTHDAY
BECAUSEBECAUSE WARNER MUSIC
CONTENTIOUSLY OWNS THE COPYRIGHTTO THE SONG AND HAS BEEN EARNING
MILLIONS FROM PEOPLE CELEBRATINGTHEIR BIRTHDAYS FOR A QUARTER OF
A CENTURY.
AND WARNER IS SO PROTECTIVE OFHIS SONG, THAT EVEN TO SING
HAPPY BIRTHDAY IN A RESTAURANT,AT A CONCERT, OR A PUBLIC PLACE,
YOU MUST PAY ROYALTIES.
DON'T BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE ARESERIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?
MARILYN MONROE SANG IT TOPRESIDENT KENNEDY AND ONE YEAR
LATER THEY WERE BOTH DEAD.
FOLKS-- I KNOW, I KNOW.
FOLKS, THIS IS A SHAMELESS CASHGRAB, AND IN WARNER MUSIC
INSISTS THAT HAPPY BIRTHDAYBELONGS TO THEM, THEN I TONIGHT
OFFER AMERICA A BIRTHDAY SONGTHAT BELONGS TO US.
