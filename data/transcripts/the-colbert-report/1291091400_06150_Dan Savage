EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS STARTED AN
IMPORTANT PROJECT TO TELL YOUNG,
GAY TEENS THAT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL
LIFE DOES GET BETTER, WHICH IS
TRUE, AS LONG AS GAY PEOPLE
DON'T NEED JOBS.
PLEASE WELCOME DAN SAVAGE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY,
DAN, WELCOME BACK.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
BEFORE WE GET INTO THE PROJECT,
YOU'VE BEEN HERE ON THE SHOW
MANY TIMES.
ONE OF THE THINGS I FORGOT TO
ASK YOU IN YEARS PAST, YOU'RE AN
ADVICE COLUMNIST.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: YOU GIVE SEX
ADVICE SOMETIMES?
>> THAT'S TRUE.
DO YOU NEED SOME?
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE THING.
HERE'S WHY AS A STRAIGHT GUY I
WOULD NEVER ASK YOUR ADVICE, AND
IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY.
IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT.
OKAY.
AND IF YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDED COOL, I MIGHT TRY
IT AND FIND OUT LATER THAT WAS
GAY.
( LAUGHTER )
THEN I'D BE LIKE, AM I GAY NOW?
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
DO YOU HAVE THAT PROBLEM WITH A
LOT OF GUYS.
>> NO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY
AWAY FROM PEGGING THEN IF YOU
KNOW THAT DEFINITION.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
PEGGY.
>> PEGGING.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THAT?
>> THAT'S HER IN THE ACTIVE ROLE
PENETRATING HIM WITH [BLEEPED].
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
I TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL CROSS
THAT RIGHT OFF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
>> YOU CAN CROSS THAT RIGHT OFF
YOUR BUCKET LIST BECAUSE YOU'VE
ALREADY DONE THAT?
>> Stephen:, NO I THINK YOUR
DESCRIPTION WAS VIVID ENOUGH.
I FEEL LIKE I WAS THERE.
YOU PAINTED A PICTURE OF ME.
THE SUBJECT AT HAND, THERE HAS
BEEN A SPATE OF HEARTBREAKING
SUICIDES BY GAY TEENAGE KIDS.
WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT "IT GETS
BETTER" AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO
DO?
>> I HEARD ABOUT THESE SUICIDES
AND HAD THE REACTION I ALWAYS
HAD WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THESE
SUICIDES WHICH IS I WISH I COULD
HAVE TALKED TO THAT KID FOR FIVE
MINUTES AND BE ABLE TO TELL HIM
THAT IT WOULD GET BETTER.
BECAUSE WHEN A 13 OR 14-YEAR-OLD
GAY KID OR LESBIAN OR BY IS
SAYING HE CAN'T PICTURE A FUTURE
WITH ENOUGH JOY TO COMPENSATE
FOR THE PAIN I'M IN NOW.
AND SO MANY ISOLATED AND BULLIED
AND ABUSED LGBT KIDS CAN'T
PICTURE THOSE FUTURES BECAUSE
THEY DON'T KNOW ANY OPENLY GAY
PEOPLE AND THEY'RE NOT AROUND
ANY OPENLY GAY PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FOR A
HOMOSEXUAL TEENAGER AS OPPOSED
TO ANY OTHER PRETTY MISERABLE
TEENAGER?
BECAUSE I'M IN ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
DIMINISHING THE MISERY A GAY
TEENAGER GOES THROUGHMENT I AM
SURE IT IS ROUGH.
BUT I SEEM TO REMEMBER HIGH
SCHOOL BEING ROUGH.
DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE ANY
SOLACE IN GAY TEENAGERS HEARING,
HEY, LOOK AROUND YOU, THE
CLARINET PLAYER IS GETTING
BEATEN ON A DAILY BASIS?
>> THE CLARINET PLAYER IS
PROBABLY BEING CALLED FAG WHILE
HE'S BEING BEATEN UP.
A LOT OF ANTI-GAY BULLYING
TARGETS KIDS PERCEIVED TO BE
GAY.
THE CLARINETIST OR THE KID WHO
IS A GEEK WHO IS STRAIGHT WHO IS
BULLIED FOR BEING A GEEK DOESN'T
GO HOME TO PARENTS WHO ALSO
BULLY HIM FOR BEING A GEEK.
HOME FOR STRAIGHT KIDS IS A
REFUGE WHERE YOU HAVE A SHOULDER
TO CRY ON AND PARENTS WHO ARE
SUPPORTIVE.
AND THAT GEEKY STRAIGHT KID
ISN'T DRAGGED TO A CHURCH WHERE
THE PASTOR SAYS GOD HATES GEEKS
AND SENDS GEEKS TO HELL AND
BEING A GEEK OR A BRAIN OR
CLARINETIST IS A PERVERSION AND
ABOMINATION.
>> Stephen: WHO DID THIS FOR
YOU WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER?
>> WHO BULLIED ME?
>> Stephen: NO, YOU CAN TELL
ME THAT TOO, BUT DID ANYBODY DO
THIS FOR YOU?
WHO GAVE YOU HOPE OR WHERE WAS
YOUR HOPE THIS WOULD GET BETTER?
>> I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO UP
IN CHICAGO SO I COULD SEE OPENLY
GAY PEOPLE AT THE MOVIE, DINNER,
OUT IN THE CITY BECAUSE THE CITY
IS SUCH A LARGE, DIVERSE PLACE.
LOOK WHERE THESE SUICIDES ARE
TAKING PLACE, GREENSBERG,
INDIANA, THESE SMALL TOWNS IN
CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTH WHERE
THERE AREN'T ANY OPENLY GAY
ADULTS.
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING AROUND TO
LET THESE KIDS KNOW IT WILL GET
BETTER FOR THEM, THAT THEY CAN
HAVE A ADULT LIFE AND BE A
SUCCESS.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT SOME
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE DOING
THESE VIDEOS.
WE HAVE PART OF THE VIDEO FROM
JOHN BARRY, WHO IS THE DIRECTOR
OF "THE OFFICE" PERSONNEL
MANAGEMENT.
HE'S THE HEAD PERSONNEL GUY FOR
THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,
RIGHT?
>> BARACK OBAMA'S HIGHEST OPENLY
GAY OR LESBIAN APPOINTEE IN THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
>> LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
>> I AM THE HIGHEST RANK OPENLY
GAY MAN IN THE UNITED STATES
HISTORY.
I HAVE MANAGED 40% OF UNITED
STATES' LAW ENFORCEMENT,
INCLUDING THE SECRET SERVICE,
THE PARK SERVICE, AND I'VE EVEN
BEEN DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL
ZOO.
YOU CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT.
YOU CAN LOVE WHOMEVER YOU WANT,
BUT ONLY IF YOU FIRST LOVE
YOURSELF.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A POWERFUL
MESSAGE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHO ELSE YOU GOT?
YOU GOTBAUM?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Stephen: JOE BIDEN.
>> THE PRESIDENT -- PRIME
MINISTER OF ENGLAND, A
CONSERVATIVE.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REPUBLICAN
ELECTED OFFICIALS OR
HIGH-PROFILE CONSERVATIVE
PUNDITS.
>> Stephen: DOES THIS PROGRAM
INCLUDE TAX CUTS?
>> I THINK TAX CUTS CUT ACROSS
ALL SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS.
WOULD YOU MAKE ONE?
WOULD YOU SET AN EXAMPLE?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING?
DOES THIS IN ANY WAY INVOLVE
PEGGING?
( LAUGHTER )
>> YOU'RE FREE TO CREATE YOUR
OWN VIDEO.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY CREATIVE,
SO YOU CAN INCLUDE PEGGING, BUT
YOU WOULD HAVE TO THEN UPLOAD IT
TO X-TUBE AND NOT YOUTUBE.
>> VERY KIND OF YOU.
I'LL TAKE THAT UNDER
CONSIDERATION.
YES, I WOULD DO ONE.
AND I ENCOURAGE ALL MY
CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS TO DO THE
SAME.
DAN SAVAGE, "IT GETS
