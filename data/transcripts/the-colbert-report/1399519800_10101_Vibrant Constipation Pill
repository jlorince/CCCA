WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, THAT-- THIS CROWDTONIGHT IS AS CRISP AS A NEW
STALK OF CELERY.
AND THIS IS WHY I WILL NEVERPHONE IT IN, TO THE LAST DROP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, BEFORE I SAY
ANYTHING ELSE TONIGHT IWOULD LIKE TO SAY T-MOBILE.
(LAUGHTER)T-MOBILE PROUD SPONSOR OF
THAT THING I JUST SAID.
YOU SEE, I AGREED YEARS AGOTHAT EVERY NOW AND THEN I
WOULD DO THESE INTEGRATEDSPONSORSHIPS ON THE REPORT
TO HELP PAY THE PRODUCTIONBILLS AND THAT'S WHAT THAT
WAS.
SO LET'S-- (LAUGHTER)
LET'S GET-- LET'S GET TO OURNUMBER ONE STORY WHICH
TONIGHT IS A NUMBER TWOSTORY.
>> DOCTORS BELIEVE THEY'VECOME UP WITH A WAY TO HELP
WITH CONSTIPATION.
IT INVOLVES A VIBRATINGPILL.
DOCTORS IN ISRAEL ARETESTING A NEW PILL THAT
SHAKES UP YOUR INTESTINALAREA AND GETS THINGS ROLLING
AGAIN.
>> Stephen: YES, A PILL THATVIBRATES YOUR CONSTIPATION
AWAY.
SORRY PRUNES, YOU JUST LOSTYOUR JOB TO A ROBOT.
THE NEW PILL IS CALLEDVIBRANT, A COMBINATION OF
THE WORDS VIBRATE AND NNNT.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH IS THE SOUND YOU MAKE
WHEN IT'S WORKING.
THE PILL PULSATES THREETIMES A MINUTE AND MIMICS
PERISTALSIS, THE BIOLOGICALPROCESS THAT PUSHES WAVES OF
WASTE THROUGH THE BOWELS, IKNOW YOU ARE SAYING WHERE I
DO SIGN UP FOR WAVES OFWASTE.
THAT'S MY ONLY PROBLEM WITHTHIS PILL.
YOU CAN'T GET IT IT'S STILLIN CLINICAL TRIALS.
BUT YOU FOLKS OUT THERE NEEDRELIEF NOW.
WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND YOUPUT YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE
AND SHOVE IT WHERE THESUN DON'T SHINE.
AND-- (APPLAUSE)
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WHY NOTMAKE IT A TOP OF THE LINE
SMART PHONE FROM T-MOBILE.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE
FASTEST NATIONWIDE 4GLTENETWORK YOU CAN CALL YOUR
COLON FROM ANYWHERE IN THECOUNTRY WITH GREAT RECEPTION
NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU JAMMEDIT UP THERE.
AND T-MOBILE IS THEUNCARRIER, THE PHONE COMPANY
THAT OFFERS CONTRACTFREEDOM.
THAT MEANS NO ANNUAL SERVICECONTRACTS, NO LIMITS ON DATA
AND UPGRADES WHENEVER YOUWANT THE HOTTEST NEW SMART
PHONE THROBBING YOURDUODENUM.
AND WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?
YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT A PHONEFROM ONE OF T-MOBILE'S
COMPETITORS WEDGED UP THERE?
NO PROBLEM, T-MOBILE WILLEVEN HELP PAY YOUR
TERMINATION FEES WHEN YOUBREAK UP WITH YOUR OLD
CARRIER, AND COVER UP TOFIVE DEVICES IN ONE PLAN,
FINALLY THE WHOLE FAMILY CANNESTLE THEM IN THEIR RECTUMS.
NOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING,YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
STEPHEN, YOU SPENT A LOT OFTIME PUSHING THIS T-MOBILE
PRODUCT INTEGRATION.
ARE YOU T-MOBILE'S PUPPET?
NO, I WANT TO ASSURE YOU,NATION, T-MOBILE DID NOT ASK
ME TO SAY ANY OF THIS.
ALL THEIR MARKETING TEAMASKED IS THAT I QUOTE NOT
POSITION THE BRAND IN ANEGATIVE LIGHT.
AND-- THAT, THAT, THAT ISNOT A PROBLEM.
WHERE I'M TELLING YOU TOPOSITION IT, THERE ISN'T ANY
LIGHT AT ALL.
REMEMBER, T-MOBILE, PUT ITIN YOUR BUTT.
