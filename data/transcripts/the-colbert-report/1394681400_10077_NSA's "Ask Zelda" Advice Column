>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION NATION, IT'S NOSECRET THAT I AM A HUGE FAN
OF THE NSA AND I SUPPORTTHEIR UNLIMITED BUDGET AND
ZERO SUPERVISION. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
ABSOLUTE POWER SUCCEEDSABSOLUTELY.
AND I'M SICK AND TIRED OFTHE PEOPLE STRESSING OUT
ABOUT THE NSA SPECIFICALLY,PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE NSA
THANKFULLY THEY HAVE ACUTTING EDGE SYSTEM TO DEAL
WITH EMPLOYEE STRESS.
>> WHO KNEW AMERICA'S SPIESHAD THEIR OWN DEAR ABBEY.
ACCORDING TO THE HILLNEWSPAPER, NSA EMPLOYEES
SEND THEIR PERSONAL ANDWORKPLACE QUESTIONS TO ASK
ZELDA, A POPULAR COLUMN ANDA BULLETIN ON THE AGENCY'S
INTERNET.
>> Stephen: THE NSA HAS ITSOWN DEAR ABBEY AND SHE GETS
A LOT OF LETTERS, SOME OFWHICH WERE SENT TO HER.
NOW ZELDA'S FIRST COLUMN WASABOUT PROPER OFFICE ATTIRE
IN THE SUMMER.
SHE WRITES NOT ONLY IS BEACHATTIRE UNPROFESSIONAL IN THE
WORKPLACE, BUT IN CERTAINCASES IT CAN BE DOWN RIGHT
DISTRACTING TO COWORKERS IFYOU GET MY DRIFT.
I DO, ZELDA.
IF YOUR COWORKER CAN'T KEEPHIS EYES OFF YOUR BARE LEGS
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO KEEPHIS EYES ON THE PERSON HE IS
WATCHING UNDRESS THROUGHTHEIR LAPTOP CAMERA?
PERHAPS MY FAVORITE ZELDALETTER COMES FROM AN AGENT
WHO WROTE IN TO COMPLAIN THATWHEN THE BOSS SEES COWORKERS
HAVING A QUIET CONVERSATION,HE WANTS TO KNOWS WHAT'S
BEING SAID.
HE HAS HIS DESIGNATEDSNITCHES AND EXPECTS THEM TO
KEEP HIM APPRISED.
NOW WE'RE MORE SUSPICIOUS OFEACH OTHER AND TEAM WORK IS
BECOMING HARDER.
THIS SNITCH PROGRAM IS JUSTANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE NSA'S
FAMOUS TOTAL INFORMATIONAWARENESS AND TOTAL IRONY
UNAWARENESS.
(LAUGHTER)AND ZELDA HAS GOT THE ANSWER
FOR THESE CONCERNS TOO.
IF YOU ARE BOTHERED BYSNITCHES, THE BEST SOLUTION
IS TO KEEP YOUR BEHAVIOURABOVE REPROACH.
EXACTLY.
REMEMBER, NSA EMPLOYEES,SURVEILLANCE IS DESIGNED TO
ROOT OUT TREASON.
SO IT SHOULDN'T BOTHER YOUIF YOU ARE NOT HIDING
ANYTHING.
AND SINCE NOTHING CAN BEHIDDEN FROM THE NSA, NOTHING
IS BOTHERING YOU.
