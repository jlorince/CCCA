>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH
NATION, IT'S NO SURPRISE BUTI HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE
WITH BARACK OBAMA CONSTANTLYEMBARRASSING OUR COUNTRY.
(LAUGHTER)HE'S LIKE AMERICA'S DORKY
DAD.
WEARING HIGH WASTED JEANS,ALWAYS MONITORING WHAT WE DO
ON THE INTERNET.
(LAUGHTER)THANK GOD IT'S ONLY A COUPLE
MORE YEARS UNTIL WE GET TOGO TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
BUT THE MOST EMBARRASSINGTHING ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT IS
THAT HE KEEPS DESTROYING 250YEARS OF AMERICAN GREATNESS.
>> WE GOT THIS VIDEO OFBARACK OBAMA BOWING TO THE
SAUDI KING ABDULLAH.
AND NOW LOOK, WATCH HOWLOW-- HE'S WAY BELOW THE
SHOULDER.
>> TAKE A LOOK THE PRESIDENTOF THE UNITED STATES BOWING
TO THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN.
THAT IS A DEEP BOW TOO.
>> BARACK OBAMA DID A DEEP,DEEP BOW.
>> IN JAPANESE CULTURE ADEEP BOW IS VERY OFTEN SEEN
AS A SIGN OF APOLOGY ORCONTRITION.
AND THE GREATER THE APOLOGY,THE GREATER THE --.
>> YOU KNOW, THE JAPANESEINVADED PEARL HARBOR, YOU
BOW.
>> Stephen: OH, IT GOES BACKEVEN FURTHER THAN THAT.
I MEAN OBAMA SPENT YEARS ONTHE VERY SAME ISLAND AS
PEARL HARBOR GROVELING TOJAPAN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES.
SHAMEFUL, SHAMEFUL.
(APPLAUSE)>> WELL, FOLKS  I'M
THRILLED TO BE SAD TO SAYOUR GENUFLECTOR IN
CHIEF HAS DONE IT AGAIN ANDIT WAS SPOTTED BY JOURNALIST
AND MAN DEFINITELY NOTHIDING A BALD SPOT MATT
DRUGDGE.
U.S. PRESIDENT BOWS TOJAPANESE ROBOT.
HE BOWED TO JAPANESE ROBOT.
OUR NATION HASN'T BEEN THISHUMILIATED SINCE JOHN
ADAMS BOWED TO GEORGE 3rd'SBUTTER CHURN.
AND NATION, THIS WAS ANHONEST TO GOD GROVELING I'M
NOT WORTHY MR. ROBOTO BOW,THEN DID SOMETHING EVEN MORE
INSULTING TO AMERICANS, HEPLAYED SOCCER WITH IT OR AS
THEY CALL ROBOT SOCCER INJAPAN, FOREPLAY.
AND FOLKS, THE EMBARRASSMENT,THE EMBARRASSMENT TO AMERICA
DID NOT END THERE THE ENTIRETRIP WAS INTENDED TO SECURE
A TRADE DEAL WHICH OBAMADISCUSSED OVER DINNER WITH
JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER ATTHE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANT IN
THE WORLD, AND OBAMAHUMILIATED US THERE BY
EATING ONLY HALF OF HIS MEAL.
HALF THE MEAL?
I MEAN FORGET ABOUT THEUNITED NATIONS.
OBAMA JUST GOT AMERICAKICKED OUT OF THE CLEAN
PLATE CLUB.
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE IS THISMAN SETTING FOR JAPANESE
CHILDREN?
EVERY ONE KNOWS IF YOU DON'TFINISH YOUR SEA URCHIN YOU
CAN'T HAVE YOUR DESSERT, SEAURCHIN PENIS.
SO WITH ALL THIS BUNGLINGIT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE
PRESIDENT LEFT JAPAN WITHOUTTHE TRADE AGREEMENT.
AND WITHOUT THE HELLO KITTYBACKPACK HE PROMISED JOE
BIDEN.
SOMEONE'S GOING TO THROW ATANTRUM.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY.
NATION, OUR JAPANESE FRIENDSHAVE BEEN INSULTED AND THE
PRESIDENT HAS GOT TO SAVEFACE.
BY THE WAY, FACE ALSO AJAPANESE DELICACY.

REPUTATION TO THE JAPANESEPEOPLE, MR. PRESIDENT YOU
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT ADOLPHIN.
OH, IT'S A DELICACY OVERTHERE BUT DON'T HALF ASS IT.
YOU MUST FINISH THE ENTIREDOLPHIN.
