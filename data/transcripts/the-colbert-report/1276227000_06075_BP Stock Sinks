REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, AS YOU KNOW, AS I'M SURE
YOU'VE HEARD, B.P. IS STILL
STRUGGLING TO STOP THAT LEAK IN
THE GULF OF MEXICO.
A TASK MADE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BY
THE FACT THAT IT'S 5,000 FEET
UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN.
THE ONLY THING LOWER THAN B.P.'S
BLOWN WELLS IS THEIR STOCK
PRICE.
[LAUGHTER]
JIM.
>> AS IF B.P. DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT, TODAY ITS
STOCK CLOSED AT A 14-YEAR LOW.
>> A TOTAL OF $82 BILLION OF THE
VALUE OF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN
WIPED OUT SINCE THE START OF THE
OIL RIG DISASTER.
>> STEPHEN: $82 BILLION LOST.
GOD.
IT WOULD BE SUCH A TRAGEDY IF
ANY PELICANS OWNED B.P. STOCK.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, IT'S
B.P.'S WELL, SO THE ONLY PERSON
TO BLAME IS BARACK OBAMA.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING IT.
IT'S FORMER BRITISH SECRETARY OF
TRADE LORD TEBBIT.
WOW.
LORD TEBBIT.
[HORN SOUNDS]
ANYWAY, FORMER SECRETARY OF
TRADE LORD TIBBETT.
[HORN SOUNDS]
KNOCK IT OFF.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
LURCH OVER HERE DOESN'T LIKE HOW
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BLAMED B.P.,
SAYING OF OUR PRESIDENT, "THE
WHOLE MIGHT OF AMERICAN WEALTH
AND TECHNOLOGY IS DISPLAYED AS
UTTERLY UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE
CAST ROUT SPILL, SO WHAT MORE
NATURAL THAN A XENOPHOBIC
DISPLAY OF BIGOTED PRESIDENTIAL
PETULANCE."
[CROWD BOOING]
QUITE A COLD, CUTTING CONTINUUM
OF CRUEL CONSONANTS, COUNT
CRUMPET.
[APPLAUSE]
BRING ME ANOTHER CHILD TO FEAST
UPON.
BRING ME MAN FLESH.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY I THINK B.P.
SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE OIL SPILL, BUT I DO SHARE
THEIR CONFUSION ABOUT THE
DECLINE OF THEIR STOCK.
THEY'VE STUDIED THE MATTER, AND
TODAY THEY RELEASED THIS
STATEMENT: THE COMPANY IS NOT
AWARE OF ANY REASON WHICH
JUSTIFIES THIS SHARE PRICE
MOVEMENT.
YEAH.
WHAT REASON?
I MEAN, HEY, I KNOW B.P. IS A
SOULLESS CORPORATE GIANT THAT
COULD VERY WELL KILL ALL LIFE ON
OUR EAST COAST, BUT WHY IS THEIR
STOCK GOING DOWN?
I MEAN, THIS... THINK ABOUT IT,
THINK ABOUT IT.
THIS MASSIVE OIL SPILL IN THE
GULF ISN'T THEIR WHOLE COMPANY.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIQUID
ASSETS, LIKE THEIR RUPTURED
TRANSALASKA PIPELINE AND THEIR
MASSIVE SPILL IN PRUHDOE BAY.
SO INVESTORS, JUST STICK WITH
B.P., AND I GUARANTEE YOU
EVENTUALLY WE'LL ALL BE IN THE
BLACK.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S MY STOCK PICK.
