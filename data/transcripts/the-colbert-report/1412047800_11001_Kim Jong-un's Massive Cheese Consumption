THANKS SO MUCH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M
NO FAN OF KOREAN DICTATOR ANDEVIL POTATO KIM JONG UN.
I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE ABOUT THISMAN'S SICK AFFECTION FOR THINGS
LIKE INDUSTRIAL LUBRICANT ANDMUSHROOMS.
FOR THOSE WITHOUT HIGH DEFTVS, KIM'S THE ONE IN THE
MIDDLE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NOW, THE "UN"-THINKABLE HAS
"KIM "-- HAPPENED.
>> NORTH KOREA'S LEADER HASN'TBEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC FOR THREE
WEEKS.
STATE TV REPORTS KIM JONG UN ISSUFFERING FROM DISCOMFORT.
>> SOME ARE SPECULATING THE31-YEAR-OLD IS SUFFERING FROM
SOME SORT OF HEALTH PROBLEMACCORDING TO HIS WEIGHT GAIN AS
WELL AS A RECENT LIMP.
>> THE BRILLIANT COMRADE, AS HEIS KNOWN, HAS GOUT, WHICH IS
CAUSED BY TOO MUCH BOOZE ANDRICH FOOD.
>> STEPHEN: WHICH HAS THEPEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA IN A STATE
OF UTTER CONFUSION BECAUSE THEIRLANGUAGE HAS NO WORD FOR "TOO
MUCH FOOD."
(LAUGHTER)AND KIM-WATCHERS LIKE ME KNOW
WHAT FOOD HE'S TOO-MUCHING OF.
>> NORTH KOREAN LEADER ISPUTTING HIS HEALTH AT SERIOUS
RISK DUE TO DANGEROUSLY HIGHCONSUMPTION OF CHEESE.
>> THE 31-YEAR-OLD HAS PACKED ONA LOT OF WEIGHT IN A SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO THE LARGEAMOUNT OF IMPORTED SWISS CHEESE
HE KEEPS EATING.
>> THE DICTATOR ISAPPARENTLY OBSESSED WITH CHEESE.
THERE'S WORD HE FELL IN LOVEWITH SWISS CHEESE WHEN HE
STUDIED IN SWITZERLAND.
>> STEPHEN: YES, SWITZER-LAND.
(LAUGHTER)KIM'S MASSIVE CHEESE CONSUMPTION
IS ALL THE MORE AMAZING WHEN YOUCONSIDER THAT NORTH KOREA HAS
YET TO ACHIEVE CRACKERTECHNOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)KIM'S FAVORITE CHEESE IS
"EMMENTAL, A CHEESE MADE INSWITZERLAND."
YOU CAN TELL IT'S SWISS BECAUSEIT TASTES NEUTRAL, AND THE HOLES
CAN BE USED FOR STORING NAZIGOLD.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE KIM IS

(LAUGHTER)AND NOW -- AND NOW -- AND NOW IT
LOOKS LIKE KIM IS ABOUT TO BEDAIRY UNHAPPY.

>> NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIMJONG UN WILL NOT BE GETTING
TOP-QUALITY CHEESE ANYTIME SOON.
THE HEAD OF ONE OF FRANCE'SFAMOUS CHEESE-MAKING SCHOOLS
SAYS NORTH KOREA APPROACHED HERLAST MONTH ASKING IF SOME OF
LIL' KIM'S PEOPLE COULD TRAIN ATTHE FACILITY.
SHE SAYS SHE POLITELY TURNEDTHEM DOWN.

AND WEARING CHEESE HATS, AND THENEXT DAY AT WORK WE DISCUSS THE
GAME WHILE GATHERING AROUND THECHEESE COOLER.
