FOLKS, SPEAKING OF MIND CONTROL, BILL CLINTON GAVE A SPEECH LAST NIGHT SCHEDULED
FOR HALF AN HOUR WHICH JUST WRAPPED UP A FEW MINUTES AGO.
(LAUGHTER) AND I WOULD ADD HIT CLINTON STARTED STRONG.
>> WE ARE HERE TO NOMINATE A PRESIDENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I'VE GOT ONE IN MIND.
>> Stephen: UNFORTUNATELY,
BARACK OBAMA DEFEATED HER FOUR YEARS AGO.
(LAUGHTER) LUCKILY, LUCKILY BILL HAD ANOTHER OPTION.
>> I WANT TO NOMINATE A MAN WHO IS COOL ON THE OUTSIDE.
>>  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT WHO BURNS FOR AMERICA ON THE INSIDE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> COOL ON THE OUTSIDE,
BURNS ON THE INSIDE.
NOW AT FIRST I WAS EXCITED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE DEMOCRATS HAD NOMINATED A HALF MICROWAVE BURRITO.
SADLY, HISPANIC OUTREACH.
SADLY, SADLY HE MEANT BARACK OBAMA.
NOW OF COURSE HE THEN DID HIS WHOLE CLINTON THING.
AND THE MAINSTREAM BUBBA LOVERS SWOONED IN ECSTASY.
>> THE REASON WHY SO MANY OF US CALL HIM THE GREATEST POLITICIAN TONIGHT, THE
MASTER, BILL CLINTON DELIVERED A MAST EAR-- MASTERPIECE OF A SPEECH.
>> I'M SITTING HERE UNGIDDY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT BARACK OBAMA NEEDED.
>> I'M JUST RUBBER.
I'M JUST--  (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WOW!
WOW.
RACHEL MADDOW HAS PUT ON SOME WEIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN IS THERE ANY-- HELP ME OUT.
IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE WHO CAN STAND UP TO THE CLINTON CHARM OFFENSIVE?
HOW ABOUT A CONSERVATIVE.
CNN'S ALEX CASALANOS.
>> THIS CONVENTION IS DONE THIS WILL BE THE MOMENT THAT PROBABLY RE-ELECTED BARACK OBAMA.
>> Stephen: SHUT UP!
(LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON CNN DOES NOT MEAN NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE, ONE CONSERVATIVE PUNDIT OUT THERE WHO CAN CALL CLINTON ON HIS CHARM.
WHAT ABOUT FOX NEWS'S CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.
>> I THINK IT WAS A GIANT SWING AND A MISS.
AND TRUEY SELF-INDULGENT.
>> THINK ABOUT HOW LONG OBAMA WAS HIDING BEHIND THE CURTAINS WAITING FOR CLINTON TO FINISH?
IN SOME WAY IT WAS THE CLINTON REVENGE FOR '08.
>> Stephen: YES.
WHAT A BLISTERING PAYBACK.
KEEP THE MAN WAITING BEHIND THE CURTAIN WHILE YOU PUBLICLY SHOWER HIM WITH COMPLIMENTS AND PRAISE.
(LAUGHTER) THE FOOL!
THE INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT FOOL WHO WILL LEAD THIS COUNTRY TO A BETTER DAY,
FOUR MORE YEARS!
I'LL TELL YOU FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU, WHAT CLINTON REALLY BLEW IT.
WHEN HE OPENED THIS CAN OF WORMS.
>> ARE WE BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE?
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE IS NOT THE QUESTION.
>> IF THERE'S ONE QUESTION ON THE MINDS OF VOTERS RIGHT NOW, IT'S THIS.
ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.
>> ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.
>> ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: YES.
(LAUGHTER) WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, LITERALLY.
>> ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL FOR THE HILL, A MAJORITY,
52% OF LIKELY VOTERS SAY THE NATION IS IN WORSE CONDITION NOW THAN SEPTEMBER 2008.
>> Stephen: FOUR YEARS AGO,
SEPTEMBER 6th, 2008, WE WERE STILL RIDING HIGH.
THE EMERGENCY BAILOUT OF FANNIE AND FREDDIE WAS WAY IN THE FUTURE.
SEPTEMBER 7th.
ALMOST 12 HOURS FROM NOW.
AND IT WAS OVER A WEEK BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS.
OUR NATION, OUR NATION HAD SEVEN DAYS OF MOXIE LEFT.
(LAUGHTER) AND REMEMBER, IT WAS A GOLDEN AGE.
AS FAR AS WE KNEW.
LARRY KING WAS STILL ON THE AIR.
AND ALL I KNEW OF PIERS MORGAN WAS HIS DELICIOUS SPICE RUM.
I MEAN 2008, RATHER WALL-E,
REMEMBER SINGLE LADIES,
REMEMBER YOUR PENSION?
IT WAS A MAGICAL TIME WHEN THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES COULD STILL SAY THIS.
>> THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE, OF OUR ECONOMY ARE STRONG.
>> Stephen: YES.
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY ARE STRONG.
LIKE A POWER LIFTER.
>> YEAH, THERE IT IS.
NICE.
>> Stephen: THE ECONOMY IS RESTING.
AND FOLKS,
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THE REPUBLICANS JUST WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO THAT
TIME, RIGHT BILL CLINTON?
>> THEY WANT TO CONTACT US-- EVEN MORE THAN PRESIDENT BUSH Z THEY WANT
TO GET RID OF THOSE PESKY FINANCIAL REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANOTHER
CRASH AND PROHIBIT FUTURE BAILOUTS.
>> Stephen: YES, MITT ROMNEY JUST WANTS TO TAKE US BACK TO THE OLD POLICIES, BACK TO
THE FUTURE.
>> ROSE, WHERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T NEED ROADS.
>> Stephen: GOOD, BECAUSE IN THE ROMNEY-RYAN BUDGET THEY CUT ALL FINDING FOR HIGHWAYS.
(LAUGHTER) SO MITT, MITT, YOU JUST KEEP DEMANDING THAT AMERICANS ANSWER THE QUESTION.
ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.
BUT JUST DON'T ANSWER IT YOURSELF.
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN RELEASING MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF YOUR TAX RETURN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
