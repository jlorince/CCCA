>> Stephen: WHAT ON EARTH?
WHEN I WAS... IN THE 1970s, IGREW UP IN THE '70s, THAT WAS
BIG HITCHHIKING TIME.
♪ LIKE A VISION SHE WAS LAYINGTHERE ♪♪
CHEVY VAN.
PICK UP A GIRL, HAVE SEX WITHHER, DROP HER OFF AT THE NEXT
TOWN.
I WAS TAUGHT NOT TO HITCHHIKE BYMY FOLKS BECAUSE THE MANSON
FAMILY WOULD GRAB YOU.
WEREN'T YOU SCARED?
>> I WAS SCARED THAT NOBODYWOULD PICK ME UP.
BUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THEBOOK, I IMAGINED ALL THE THINGS
I WOULD BE SCARED OF.
I WROTE 15 RIDES, THE BEST ICOULD IMAGINE, AND THE BEST FOR
ME WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE THEBEST FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEST-CASEAND WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.
WHAT'S THE BEST THING THAT COULDHAVE HAPPENED?
>> WELL I HAD SEX IN ADEMOLITION DERBY IN THE CAR
IN THE RACE. THAT WAS FUN.
>> Stephen: JOHN, THAT'S THEDEFINITION OF UNSAFE SEX.
>> WELL, IT WAS SAFE.
>> Stephen: WHO WERE SOME OFTHE PEOPLE WHO DID PICK
YOU UP?
>> A MINISTER'S WIFE.
A COP.
A TRUCKER.
A COAL MINER.
A ROCK BAND CALLED "HERE WE GOMAGIC"
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINKTHEY PULLED THEIR CAR OVER FOR
YOU?
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE DRESSEDLIKE A VALET?
>> NO, I THINK I'M THE BELLBOYAT HOWARD JOHNSON'S.
THAT'S WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU EVERSCARED?
>> I WAS NOT SCARED OF THEPEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WERE THEY SCAREDOF YOU?
>> NO, THEY THOUGHT I WAS AHOMELESS MAN.
THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.
THEY THOUGHT I WAS A BEGGAR WHOWAS TOO STUPID TO HOLD THE SIGN
AT A RED LIGHT INSTEAD OF AT ANENTRANCE RAMP WHERE I WAS
>> Stephen: WHAT DID YOUDISCOVER ABOUT AMERICA?
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU?
>> IT TOOK NINE DAYS, 21 RIDES.
>> WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER IN YOUR21 RIDES?
IS THERE ANY COMMON THEMEBETWEEN ALL THESE PEOPLE?
>> HOW INCREDIBLY OPEN MINDEDTHEY WERE ABOUT PEOPLE.
HOW PEOPLE THAT PICK UPHITCHHIKERS, ONCE THEY STOP, IT
MAKES THEM A LITTLE BETTER OF APERSON.
I THINK THE PEOPLE WERE GREAT.
THEY WERE SO OPEN MINDED, MOREOPEN MINDED THAN INTELLECTUALS I
KNOW IN L.A. AND NEW YORK.
THESE PEOPLE DEFIED WHAT YOU'DTHINK ABOUT A COAL MINER.
IT DIDN'T MATTER IF THEY WEREREPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT EITHER.
THEY WERE COMPLETELY OPEN TOHELPING PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE AFAVE?
>> MY FAVE, WELL, I HAD AREPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIAL, THE
YOUNGEST ONE IN MARYLAND, WHOPICKED ME UP AND DROVE ME TO
OHIO.
HIS PARENTS THOUGHT I KIDNAPPEDHIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD TO
GOOGLE ME IF YOU'RE A PARENT.
THEN HE DROVE 48 HOURS AT80mph AND CAUGHT UP WITH
ME IN DENVER AND GAVE ME MORERIDES.
HE WAS THE BEST RIDE I HAD,DEFINITELY.
>> Stephen: WOW.
WOW.
>> HE WAS GREAT.
>> Stephen: WAS THERE... WASTHERE ANY CHANCE HE TOOK YOU TO
A DEMOLITION DERBY?
>> NO.
HE DIDN'T.
[LAUGHTER]IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT.
IT WAS A BROMANCE.
>> Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU MOSTAFRAID OF.
WE'VE HEARD YOUR BEST-CASESCENARIOS. WHAT WERE YOUR WORSE
CASE SCENARIOS? WHAT WERE YOUAFRAID MIGHT HAPPEN?
>> I WAS AFRAID... I GOT PICKEDUP BY A WOMAN.
I GET IN THE CAR, AND SHE SAID,HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH A
JUNKY.
AND I SAID, WELL, NOT KNOWINGLY.
AND SHE SAID, BECAUSE YOU CANJUDGE.
YOU CAN COME OUT AND I CAN'T BESTRUNG OUT?
SHE WAS ONLY SEXUALLY ATTRACTEDTO JUNKIES, WHICH IS CALLED A
SCAG HAG.
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.
>> IT'S FICTION.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN GO INTOYOUR OWN MIND AND SURPRISE
YOURSELF.
>> THAT'S WHAT I HOPED TO DO.
>> Stephen: THIS BEING AMERICA,WERE YOU PACKING HEAT?
>> NO.
BUT ALL MY CRIMINAL FRIENDS TOLDME TO.
ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW IN JAILSAID, TAKE A GUN.
TAKE MACE.
THEY WERE MORE UPTIGHT ABOUTIT THAN MY FAMILY.
>> THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN JAIL.
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE LESSON
YOU WANT TO TEACH ALL OF US?
>> THAT THIS SUMMER EVERYBODYSHOULD TAKE A HITCHHIKING TRIP,
EVEN IF IT'S FOR TWO MILES.
IT'S AN ADVENTURE, A SOAP OPERA,A REALITY SHOW.
