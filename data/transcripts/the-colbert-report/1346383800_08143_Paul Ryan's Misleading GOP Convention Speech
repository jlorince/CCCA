BLACK.
OF COURSE, MULTICULTURAL, OF COURSE THE REAL STAR OF THE EVENING WAS VICE PRESIDENTIAL
AMERICAN PAUL RYAN.
WHO DELIVERED THE SPEECH OF A LIFETIME.
IT NOT ONLY BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE TO ITS FEET BUT ALSO FINALLY EARNED HIM THAT PUBLIC SPEAKING
MERIT BADGE.
HE MADE EAGLE SCOUT!  FORCE FORMS.  BUT, FOLKS, IT IS NO SURPRISE, HE WAS ABLE TO RELATE
TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
>> WE ARE A FULL GENERATION APART.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY AND I.
IN SOME WAYS, WE ARE DIFFERENT.
THERE ARE THE SONGS ON HIS IPOD,
WHICH I HAVE HEARD ON THE CAMPAIGN BUS AND I HAVE HEARD IT ON MANY HOTEL ELEVATORS.
>> MY PLAY LIST STARTS WITH AC/DC AND ENDS WITH ZEPPELIN.
>> Stephen: WHO WHOO!  AAAHH!
>> OF COURSE, OF COURSE, IT IS ZEP, AFTER ALL, HE COMES FROM THE LAND OF ICE AND SNOW.
>> THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS,
ROMNEY, YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THE ZEP, OLD MAN.
BECAUSE YOU ARE ONE-YEAR-OLDER THAN ROBERT PLANT.
BUT THE REAL, THE REAL GAME CHANGER WAS WHEN RYAN BROUGHT THE HURT STICK TO OBAMA.
I MEAN, LISTEN TO THIS CRUSHING STORY OF A GM FACTORY BEING SHUT ERRED IN HIS HOMETOWN.
>> MY HOME STATE VOTED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT CHANGE,
MANY PEOPLE LIKED THE SOUND OF IT, ESPECIALLY IN JANESVILLE,
WHERE WE WERE ABOUT TO LOSE A MAJOR FACTORY.
RIGHT THERE AT THAT PLANT,
CANDIDATE OBAMA SAID, I BELIEVE THAT IF OUR GOVERNMENT IS THERE TO SUPPORT YOU, THIS PLANT WILL
BE HERE FOR ANOTHER 100 YEARS.
WELL, AS IT TURNED OUT, THAT PLANT DIDN'T LAST ANOTHER YEAR.
>> Stephen: WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.
BECAUSE IF IT HAD LASTED ANOTHER YEAR, THEN OBAMA WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT WHEN IT CLOSED.
INSTEAD IT WAS GEORGE W. BUSH.
THANKS A LOT, OBAMA.
AND THE LAME EXTREME NIT-PICK PATROL ARE NOW SAYING THAT THERE WERE OTHER TIMES THAT RYAN
MISREPRESENTED THE FACTS IN HIS SPEECH.
HERE'S WHEN THEY SAY HE WAS LYING.
JIMMY?
>> RIGHT -- THERE.
WHEN HE STARTS, WHEN HE STARTS MOVING HIS LIPS.
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE.
NOW ONE LIBERAL WEB SITE OUT THERE EVEN SPEWED RYAN'S SPEECH WAS AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO SET
THE WORLD RECORD FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF BLATANT LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS SLIPPED
SLIPPED INTO A SINGLE POLITICAL SPEECH.
AND NO SURPRISE THAT COMES FROM THE PINKOS OVER AT FOX NEWS.
FAIR AND BALANCED MY ASS!
>> BUT THANK GOD, THANK GOD,
FOLKS, THE ROMNEY-RYAN TICKET ISN'T GRABBING THEIR ANKLES FOR REALITY, AS THE ROMNEY
CAMPAIGN'S OFFICIAL POLLSTER TOLD ABC NEWS WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET OUR CAMPAIGN BE DICTATED
BY FACT CHECKERS.
OR, OR AS HE SAID IN MY NONFACT CHECK VERSION, I WOULD TOTALLY DO STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> THE FEEL IS, THE FEELING IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
BUT SOME IN THE MEDIA UNDERSTAND THAT FOR RYAN TO BE A TRUE GAME CHANGER, HE HAS GOT TO TREAT
REALITY LIKE A GAME.
I MEAN, CMN GETS IT.
>> THE CRITICS OUT THERE WILL DISPUTE SOME OF HIS FACTS IN THE SPEECH, THERE IS NO DOUBT HE
DELIVERED FOR THE REPUBLICANS.
>> THERE WILL BE SOME ISSUES THERE WITH SOME OF THE FACTS.
BUT IT MOTIVATED PEOPLE.
>> THERE WERE DO YOU THINK THERE WERE SOME MISSTATEMENTS OF FACTS?
>> BUT LET'S NOT FORGET.  THIS IS A SPEECH ABOUT BIG IDEAS.
>> Stephen: YES.
HUGE IDEAS, IDEAS LIKE LYING IS HANDY.
I MEAN, IF WE CARED ABOUT FACTS,
I MEAN WOULD WARREN G HARDING HAVE INVENTED THE COTTON GIN?  WOULD PRESIDENT REAGAN HAVE WON
THE 1987 NBA SLAM DUNK CONTEST?  NO!  BESIDES, MAY I REMIND EVERYONE OUT THERE IS THE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
AND TO WIN A RACE, SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO JUICE.
RYAN STRETCHING THE TRUTH TO MAKE HIS SPEECH MORE EFFECTIVE IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF DOPING.
IN THAT, IF YOU BELIEVE HIM,
YOU'RE A DOPE.
AND IT FEELS GOOD.
AND IF THEY WIN THE ELECTION IT VALIDATES THE STRATEGY AND IT WON'T MATTER WHAT THE TRUTH WAS.
AFTER ALL, JOSEF GOEBBELS ONCE SAID, IF YOU REPEAT A LIE OFTEN ENOUGH, IT BECOMES THE TRUTH.
BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY SPEECH, I AM GOING TO SAY THAT WAS BARACK OBAMA.
IT WAS BARACK OBAMA?  IT WAS BARACK OBAMA OBAMA.
IT WAS BARACK OBAMA.
WELL, THAT IS REASON ENOUGH NOT TO VOTE FOR THIS GUY, BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT TRUST A LEADER WHO
WON'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
