EVERYBODY.
NATION, FOLKS, LAST WEEK I GOT
TO CATCH UP ON MY FAVORITE
DAYTIME DRAMAS.
ON, ALL MY CHILDREN" COMESkDfY
ALL MY CHILDREN KNOW TO KEEP OUT
OF LIVES ROOM.
THAT'S DADDY'S CRYING TIME.
BUT IN THE PAST 20 YEARS,
VIEWERSHIP OF THE SOAPS HAS
DROPPED 80%, AND LAST YEAR BOTH
A 54-YEAR-OLD "AS THE WORLD
TURNS" AND THE 72-YEAR-OLD
"GUIDING LIGHT" WERE CANCELED.
AND JUST WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO
WRAP THINGS UP.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S TRAGIC, BUT AT LEAST I CAN
FIND SOME COMFORT IN ANY
"GUIDING LIGHT" 72-SEASON D.V.D.
BOX SET.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SEASON ONE.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, THE GOOD FOLKS AT "DAYS OF
OUR LIVES" MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY
TO STAY ON THE AIR.
JIM.
>> CHEX MIX.
>> WHAT'S CHEX MIX?
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING UNDER A
ROCK?
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN LIVING UNDER A
ROCK, I JUST DON'T EAT CHECK
MIX.
>> IT'S SO GOOD.
IT'S LIKE A MILLION DIFFERENT
FLAVORS IN YOUR MOUTH AT THE
SAME TIME.
>> WOW.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: NOW THE UNTRAINED
EYE MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED IT, BUT
IN THAT SCENE ABOUT CHEX MIX,
THERE WAS SOME PRODUCT PLACEMENT
FOR CHEX MIX.
THIS LEVEL OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT
I THINK IS A GREAT IDEA.
AND WHAT YOU SAW THERE WAS JUST
THE Q-TIP OF THE DOLE BRAND
ICEBERG LETTUCE.
SHOW MORE, SLIM JIM.
>> NOT A LOT OF FUN TO BE HAD
HERE, OH, EXCEPT FOR THESE BAD
BOYS.
>> CHERRIOS.
SCRABBLE AT THIS HOUR?
>> HEY, NOW, IT'S NOT JUST FOR
BREAKFAST, NOT TO MENTION I AM
STUDYING TO BECOME A NURSE, SO I
FEEL LIKE I SHOULD PROBABLY EAT
HEALTHIER, AND SINCE THEY HAVE
WHOLE GRAIN AND ONLY ONE GRAM OF
SUGAR, WHICH IS EXCELLENT, YOU
KNOW...
>> TAKE YOUR TIME.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: TALK ABOUT SEXUAL
TENSION.
( LAUGHTER )
TUNE IN TOMORROW TO FIND OUT
WHETHER THEY DO IT WITH OR
WITHOUT MILK.
SO BRAVO, SOAPS, FOR PUTTING THE
CEREAL BACK IN SERIAL DRAMA.
NATION, I'D LIKE TO CLEAR THE
AIR ABOUT SOMETHING.
LONG-TIME VIEWERS KNOW I'VE SAID
SOME PRETTY HARSH THINGS ABOUTIC
KNEEIOUS ROCKS.
WELL, TONIGHT... THAT'S NOT THE
ONLY THING YOU'VE SAID IN THE
PAST.
HELLO, STAVROS.
PAVLOS, MY LONG, LOST EVIL
FRATERNAL TWIN.
YOU WERE DEAD.
>> I WAS JUST HOLDING MY BREATH.
>> BUT WE CREMATED YOU.
>> CHECK THAT URN AGAIN.
>> OH, MY GOD, IT'S NOT ASHES,
IT'S FRESH STEP SCOOPABLE KITTY
LITTER.
( LAUGHTER )
>> NOW WITH CARBON TO ELIMINATE
ODOR.
>> YOU MAD MAN.
>> MAD?
, NO JUST CRAZY ABOUT THESE
STRAWBERRY-FLAVORED PILLSBURY
TOASTER STRUDELS.
( LAUGHTER )
I'VE WAITED A LIFETIME TO GET MY
REVENGE, BUT IN JUST ONE MINUTE
I'LL HAVE A DELICIOUS, PIPING
HOT PASTRY.
( LAUGHTER )
YOUR CHILDREN WILL LOVE THEM.
YOUR GRIEVING CHILDREN.
GOOD-BYE, STAVROS.
>> PAVLOS, NO!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> I'M OFF TO MY MOUNTAIN LAIR,
BUT NOT WITHOUT MY STRUDEL.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CHERRIOS, CHERRIOS, CHERRIOS.
NO.
WHY DID YOU TAKE THAT BULLET FOR
ME.
DON'T DIE.
DON'T DIE.
OH, NO, OH, NO, OH, NO,

LIVE FOR, LIKE YOUR 25% DAILY
