NOW FOLKS, I HAVE BEENSTEEPED IN THE HISTORY OF
SCOTLAND EVER SINCE BRAVECAME OUT ON iTUNES.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE,MERIDA.
THAT'S WHY I'M RIVETED TOALL THE NEWS FROM THE LANDS
OF KILTS AND HAGIS WHERETHIS THURSDAY CITIZENS WILL
♪ WALK 500 MILES AND THEY WALK 500 MORE TO BE THE MAN TO
WALK A --♪(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS --
I'LL TAKE IT.
THEY'RE VOTING ON THEIRFUTURE.
>> WE ARE JUST 72 HOURS AWAYFROM A ONCE IN A LIFETIME
VOTE ON SCOTTISHINDEPENDENCE.
>> SCOTLAND WILL VOTE THISWEEK ON WHETHER TO SEVERE
100-YEAR-OLD TIES WITHBRITAIN AND BECOME AN
INDEPENDENT NATION.
>> AFTER 307 YEAR ITSSCOTLAND COULD BREAK AWAY
FROM THE REST OF BRITAIN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,SCOTLAND COULD ACTUALLY
SECEDE.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAD SLAVES.
AT ISSUE IS WHETHER SCOTLANDWILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL
THEIR OWN TAX AND SOCIALSECURITY RATES AND DECISIONS
ABOUT THE LEVEL ANDALLOCATION OF PUBLIC
SPENDING.
THIS IS AN EMOTIONALLYCHARGED STRUGGLE THAT
TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE DAYSOF WILLIAM WALLCE.
>> THEY MAY TAKE A LIVES BUTTHEY'LL NEVER TAKE OUR
FREEDOM TO CALCULATE PENSIONBENEFITS BASED ON INFLATION
OR EARNINGS, WHICHEVER ISHIGHER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FREEDOM!
AND THE STAKES, AND THESTAKES GO FAR BEYOND SCOTLAND.
A VOTE FOR SEPARATION WOULDMEAN THE NEAR-CERAIN RESIGNATION
OF BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVIDCAMERON.
SEE, BACK IN 2012 CAMERON AGREEDTO THE INDEPENDENCE VOTE AS
A CALCULATED GAMBLE.
AND IF HE LOSES SCOTLAND,HE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT UP BY
WINNING INDIA BACK AT THECRAPS TABLE.
FOLKS, ANY TIME PEOPLE AREANGIRLY DEMANDING SOMETHING
AND I DON'T ENTIRELYUNDERSTAND WHY --
I AM WITH THEM.
AS AN IRISH AMERICAN I KNEWALL TOO WELL, WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO SUFFER UNDER THE BOOT OFAN INDIFFERENT MONARCHY.
ANSWER MY LETTERS, PRINCE.
I WOULD DIE 4 U.
AND IT IS LOOKING GOOD FORTHE PRO INDEPENDENCE YES
SCOTLAND CAMPAIGN.
THE POLLS WERE RUNNINGAGAINST SECESSION UNTIL
RECENTLY WHEN 47% OF THOSESURVEYED SAID YES TO
INDEPENDENCE WHILE 45% SAIDNO, WHILE ANOTHER 8% SAID
SOMETHING NO ONE ELSEOUTSIDE OF GLASGOW COULD
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.
I'M NOT SAYING THE ROAD TOINDEPENDENCE WON'T HAVE A
WEE BUMP.
FOR INSTANCE, SCOTLAND WANTSTO KEEP USING THE BRITISH
POUND.
BUT ENGLAND'S CHANCELLOR OFTHE EXCHEQUER SAYS NO
FARTHING WAY.
>> SCOTLAND WALKS AWAY FROMTHE U.K., IT WALKS AWAY FROM
THE POUND.
>> Stephen: MEANING THE NEWCOUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO REVERT
TO TRADITIONAL SCOTTISHCURRENCY, SLABS OF PEAT MOSS
STAMPED WITH SEAN CONNERY'SFACE.
(LAUGHTER)
FIVE [BLEEP] JOBBIES! FIVE[BLEEP] JOBBIES!
BUT SCOTLAND IS TOTALLY READY TOROCK OUT WITH ITS LOCH OUT.
THE SCOTS SHACKED UP BACK IN1706 AFTER THEY WENT BROKE
TRYING CON COLONIZE PANAMA.
BUT NOW, THE TABLES HAVE TURNED.IN THE LAST 32 YEARS, SCOTLAND
HAS GENERATED MORE TAX PERCAPITA THAN THE U.K. AS A WHOLE.
SO ON THEIR OWN, THEY WOULDBE ONE OF THE WORLD'S 20
WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES.
I NO IDEA THEY SOLD THATMUCH ADHESIVE TAPE.
SO I STAND WITH MY SECESSIONISTBROTHERS.
TODAY, I STEPHEN COLBERT, AM APROUD SCOTSMAN ICH BIN EIN
EDINBURGHER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW AND NOW
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
