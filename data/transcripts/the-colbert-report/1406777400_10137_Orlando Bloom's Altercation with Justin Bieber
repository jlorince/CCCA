FOLKS IF YOU WATCH THE NEWSYOU KNOW THE CONFLICTS
CONTINUE TO RAGE ALL AROUNDTHE WORLD AN TONIGHT I'M SAD
TO REPORT YET ANOTHERINTERNATIONAL DISPUTE
THAT HAS ERUPTED IN SENSELESSVIOLENCE
>> JUSTIN BIEBER AND ORLANDOBLOOM IN A HEATED ARGUMENT.
THAT IS ACTOR ORLANDO BLOOMARGUING WITH POP STAR JUSTIN
BIEBER.
OVERNIGHT AT A RESTAURANT INIBIZA SPAIN.
A CLUB-GOER TELLING THATBLOOM HAD THROWN A PUNCH AT
BIEBER.
>> Stephen: YES, EARLY REPORTSINDICATE
THAT JUSTIN BIEBER HAD HISFIRST HIT IN YEARS.
THE ROOTS OF THISCONFLICT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: FOLKS, THE ROOTS
OF THIS CONFLICT ARE, OFCOURSE, BYZANTINE AND
ANCIENT.
IN 2012 ORLANDO BLOOM WASMARRIED TO AUSTRALIAN MODEL
MIRANDA KERR, COLLECTIVELYTHEY WERE KNOWN AS MORLANDO
BLUR.
THEN IN NOVEMBER OF 2012KERR WHO HAD LONG BEEN
SUSPECTSED OF BEING ARADICAL BELIEBER WAS SEEN
WITH JUSTIN AFTER A VICTORIASECRET FASHION SHOW.
FROM THE LOOKS OF THISPICTURE, SHE WAS EITHER
CANOODLING WITH ORBABY-SITTING HIM.
FROM THAT MOMENT FROM THATMOMENT JUSTIN BIEBER AND
MIRANDA KERR WERE KNOWN ASMUSTIN KEEBLER.
WELL, NOT LONG AFTER THEFORMATION OF THE MUSTIN
KEEBLER ALLIANCE, MORLANDOBLUR BROKE UP.
GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY ARECALLED NOW, I'M NOT SURE WHO
WHO GOT CUSTODY OF THEORIGINAL NAMES.
OF COURSE AT THE TIME BIEBERHAD HIS OWN BILATERAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH DISNEYHATCHLING SELENA GOMEZ.
THEIR COUPLE NAMEWAS I BELIEVE JELUSTY GOBBLER.
CONFIRM THAT, JUDGES, THATIS CORRECT.
THEN POSSIBLY IN RETALIATIONTO BIEBER'S ALLEGED
AGGRESSION INTO THE DISPUTEDTERRITORY OF MIRANDA KERR'S
FERTILE CRESCENT, IN APRILOF 2014 ORLANDO BLOOM
ESTABLISHED CLOSE TIES WITHSELENA GOMEZ SEEN HERE,
APPARENTLY, AFTER HIS MOMSAID HE HAD TO TAKE HER TO
SEE FROZEN AGAIN.
THEIR COLLECTIVE NAME,SORLENA BLOMEZ,
TENSIONS WERE RUNNING HIGHWHEN LATE LAST NIGHT IN THE
NO MAN'S LAND OF IBIZA JUSTINBIEBER CROSSED INTO HOSTILE
TERRITORY BY WALKING PASTBLOOM'S TABLE.
BLOOM DEPLOYED DEFENSIVEMEASURES WHEN HE REFUSED TO
SHAKE BIEBER'S HAND.
TRAUMATIZED WITNESSES REPORTTHAT BIEBER THEN LAUNCHED A
SHORT RANGE BALLISTIC, SHEWAS GOOD.
SO BLOOM THREW A PUNCH ATHIM.
NOW AS A JOURNALIST IT'S MYJOB TO REPORT ON ATROCITIES
LIKE THIS, BUT TO BE CLEAR IDO NOT CONDONE THIS TYPE OF
VIOLENCE.
BECAUSE BLOOM MISSEDBIEBER'S FACE.
A DEFIANT BIEBER THENRELEASED A STATEMENT, WHAT'S
UP, BITCH, AND FLED THERESTAURANT.
(APPLAUSE)NATION, NATION, I KNOW YOU
ALL JOIN ME IN JOINING POPEFRANCIS IN HIS
ELOQUENT PLEA FOR PEACE IN THEFOAM PITS OF
IBIZA.
>> THAT WAS UNCOOL, JUSTIN.
IN THE WORDS OF EZEKIEL,BROS BEFORE HOES.
>> Stephen: BEAUTIFULLYSAID.
