>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NATION AM A HUGE AND LONG-TIME FAN OF SCI-FI WHICH, OF COURSE,
IS SHORT FOR SCI-FICTION.
(LAUGHTER) TODAY SCI-FI LOST ONE OF ITS GREATS.
RAY BRADBURY.
AUTHOR OF SUCH CLASSICS AS "FAHRENHEIT 451," "THE MARTIAN
CHRONICLES" AND "THE ILLUSTRATED MAN." HIS WORK INTRODUCED US TO
FANTASTIC FAR OFF WORLDS AND BIZARRE FUTURES YET IN HIS WORK NOTHING WAS STRANGER THAN WHAT
HE FOUND HIDDEN IN THE HUMAN MIND.
SO TONIGHT I WANT TO HONOR HIS MEMORY IN A WAY I'M SURE HE WOULD APPRECIATE-- BY BURNING
THIS COPY OF FARREN FIGHT 451.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RAY, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.
(LAUGHTER) WHATEVER STRANGE WORLD YOU'RE IN NOW, I HOPE IT'S AN INTER... AS
ENTERTAINING AS THE ONES YOU CREATED FOR US.
GOOD NIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
