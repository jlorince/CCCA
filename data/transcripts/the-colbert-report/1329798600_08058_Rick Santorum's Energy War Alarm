>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, AS I WAS
SAYING DURING THE COMMERCIAL
BREAK, RICK SANTORUM IS THE
NEW FRONT-RUNNER FOR THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
LEADING ROMNEY IN THE LATEST
NATIONAL POLL BY 10%.
I WOULD SAY THAT HE'S COME
FROM BEHIND BUT SANTORUM IS
MORALLY OPPOSED TO COMING
FROM BEHIND.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS WE NEED A
COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO KNOWS
THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS GREAT
COUNTRY.
THAT-- WITH SOMETHING ALL
THE TIME.
AND NOBODY SOUNDS THE WAFER
ALARM FOR MORE REASONS THAN
RICK SANTORUM.
CASE IN POINT.
THIS D-DAY LANDING ON
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEAD.
>> THE PRESIDENT
SYSTEMICALLY, IS DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO RAISE
THE PRICE OF ENERGY IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> HE'S SHUTTING DOWN ALL
SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR
US TO DRILL FOR OIL.
THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S
AGENDA, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.
IT'S NOT BUT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR QUALITY
OF LIFE.
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR JOB.
IT'S ABOUT SOME PHONEY IDEAL,
SOME PHONEY THEOLOGY, NO,
NOT A THEOLOGY BASED ON THE
BIBLE, A DIFFERENT THEOLOGY.
>> Stephen: YES, I AGREE
WITH THAT ONE MAN CLAPPING.
YES.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ENERGY
POLICY IS BASED ON A PHONEY
THEOLOGY.
PRESIDENT SANTORUM'S ENERGY
POLICY WOULD BE BASED ON THE
BIBLE.
YOU WANT AN ALTERNATIVE
FUEL?
HOW ABOUT A BURNING BUSH.
BURNS FOREVER, NEVER USES UP
THE WOOD.
NEXT.
NOW SANTORUM HAS TAKEN SOME
HEAT OVER THESE COMMENTS.
HEAT THAT IS NOT DUE TO
GLOBAL WAMING BUT YESTERDAY
RICK WENT ON CBS'S FACE THE
SHIVER TO SET THE RECORD
SCHIFF.
>> SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHAT
IN THE WORLD WERE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SIR.
>> WELL, I WAS TALKING ABOUT
THE RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST
THAT IS WHAT I WAS TALKING
ABOUT ENERGY.
THIS IDEA THAT MAN IS HERE
TO SERVE THE EARTH AS
OPPOSED TO HUSBAND ITS
RESOURCE -- RESOURCES AND BE
GOOD STEWARTS OF 9 EARTH.
>> Stephen: YES, GOOD
STEWARTS.
SANTORUM IS TO THE CALLING
FOR WANTON DRILLING.
HE SAYS WE MUST HUSBAND
EARTH'S RESOURCE.
THAT MEANS AS GOOD
CHRISTIANS BEFORE DRILLING,
WE MUST MARY MOTHER EARTH.
THEN WE WILL BE EARTH'S
HUSBAND, ON TOP AS GOD
INTENDED.
RACKING HER GOOD ALL NIGHT
LONG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: UNTIL SHE CAN'T
EVEN STAND STRAIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT FOLKS, THE
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AREN'T THE
ONLY WAR WE'RE FIGHTING OT
THERE.
RICK HAS KNOWN SINCE 2008
THAT THERE IS A BIGGER
CONFLICT COMING.
THAT IS WHY HE SAID THIS AT
AVE MARIA UNIVERSITY.
>> THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL
WAR AT ALL.
NOT A CULTURAL WAR AT ALL.
THIS IS A SPIRITUAL WAR.
AND THE FATHER OF LIES HAS
HIS SIGHTS ON WHAT YOU WOULD
THINK THE FATHER OF LIES
SATAN WOULD HAVE HIS SIGHTS
ON.
A GOOD, DECENT, POWERFUL,
INFLUENTIAL COUNTRY.
THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
IF YOU WERE SATAN, WHO WOULD
YOU ATTACK IN THIS DAY AND
AGE.
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO GO
AFTER.
OTHER THAN THE UNITED
STATES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
FOLKS.
THE ONLY ONE SATAN IS
ATTACKING IS US.
GOD'S FAVORITE COUNTRY.
ALL THE BAD STUFF HAPPENING
IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE
WORLD, STARVATION, GENOCIDE,
SLAVERY, THAT'S NOT SATAN.
SO IT MUST BE GOD WORKING IN
MYSTERIOUS WAYS THAT WE MUST
NOT QUESTION.
BUT RAISING THE U.S.
MARGINAL TAX RATE ON THE TOP
1%, FOLKS, THAT IS WHY THE
CERTIFICATE PENT GOT INTO
THIS GAME.
SATAN LOVES BIG GOVERNMENT.
I MEAN WHAT WAS THE APPLE
BUT THE ORIGINAL FOOD STAMP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: RICK KNOWS, RICK
KNOWS THAT THE FATHER OF
LIES IS COMING FOR US IN ALL
HIS FORMS.
LOSE FERR,
BEELZEBUBUMEPHISTOPHILE, OLD
RICK, OL DONE B BAMA, THAT
IS WHY IF RICK IS PRESIDENT
HE WILL DO WHAT NO OTHER
PRESIDENT HAS HAD THE
COURAGE TO DO, DECLARE WAR
ON HELL.
IT'S SIMPLE.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE
OUR NUCLEAR MISSILE --
MISSILES OUT OF THEIR SILOS
AND PUT THEM BACK IN UPSIDE
DOWN.
RICK IS THE ONLY WHO SEES
THIS.
I FIND IT PRETTY SUSPICIOUS
THAT OBAMA DOES NOT HAVE THE
CONTINGENCY PLAN TO DESTROY
THE CENTER OF THE
