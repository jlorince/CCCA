MUCH, EVERYBODY.
( CHEERING )
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT
WAS-- WITH AN OPENING LIKE THAT,
YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE IT'S MY
FIRST NIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
NATION, I HAVE ALWAYS SAID
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS AN AL QAEDA
CODDLER.
AND NOW HIS ADMINISTRATION IS
PROVING IT AGAIN.
>> ELDERLY TRAVELERS COULD SOON
GET A BREAK AT AIRPORT SECURITY.
STARTING MONDAY, THE T.S.A. WILL
TEST NEW PROCEDURES FOR
PASSENGERS 75 AND OLDER.
THEY CAN LEAVE THEIR SHOES ON
FOR ONE THING, SAME WITH THEIR
LIGHT OUTERWEAR.
>> Stephen:  WHAT!
ARE THEY CRAZY!
HAVE YOU SEEN THEIR SHOES?
( LAUGHTER )
THOSE THINGS COULD BE MADE
ENTIRELY OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES.
WAKE UP, T.S.A.!
OLD PEOPLE ARE POWDER KEGS.
GOLD BOND POWD EBUT STILL.
THEY'RE DISGRUNTLED, THEY HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE, AND THEY HOLD
EXTREMIST VIEWS ON MANY GROUPS.
I CAN'T EVEN REPEAT WHAT MY AUNT
RITA SAID AT THANKSGIVING ABOUT
THE SPANIARDS.
LET'S JUST SAY WE WON'T BE
SERVING SANGRIA AGAIN.
FOLKS, I HAVE ALSO ALZHEIMER'S
BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THESE
GERIATRIC JIHADIST.
PLUS I DID SOME INTERNET
RESEARCH, AND I DISCOVERED THEY
ARE ALREADY TRAINING.
( LAUGHTER )
( GUNFIRE )
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SHE SHOOTS UP A
CRACKER-BARREL BECAUSE THEIR
LEMONADE IS TOO DAMN SWEET!
WHAT DID A SPANIARD MIX IT?
I SAY WE NIP THIS IN THE BUD AND
SEND OUR ELDERLY TO GITMO.
JUST TELL THEM IT'S FLORIDA.
THEY NEVER GO OUTSIDE ANYWAY.
