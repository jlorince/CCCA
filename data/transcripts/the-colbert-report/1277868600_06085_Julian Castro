MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE MAYOR OF
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.
THEY SAY ONLY TWO THINGS COME
FROM TEXAS, STEERS AND MAYORS.
PLEASE WELCOME JULIAN CASTRO.
HEY MR. MAYOR, THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
YOUR HONOR, YOUR EXCELLENCY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELL, SIR, THANK YOU FOR COMING
ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> YOU ARE CERTAINLY A YOUNG,
SPRY THING FOR THE MAYOR OF THE
SEVENTH LARGEST CITY IN AMERICA.
>> 35 NOW.
>> WOW.
AND SHAVING.
I AM.
I DO SHAVE.
>> YOU ARE A RISING STAR IN THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
LOOK AT THESE STATS.
ELECTED MAYOR OF SAN ANTONIO,
SEVENTH LARGEST CITY IN THE
NATION, AS I SAID.
AT THE AGE OF 34, YOU ARE THE
YOUNGEST MAYOR OF A TOP-50
AMERICAN CITY.
YOU ARE ALSO HISPANIC.
THAT NATURALLY LEADS TO MY FIRST
QUESTION: COULD I SEE SOME
PAPERS, PLEASE.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING PROVING
YOU'RE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
>> I HAVE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE IT ON
YOU?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: MAY I SEE IT?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I ASK ALL MY GUESTS.
WE USUALLY CUT IT OUT OF THE
SHOW.
I DO THIS TO DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN, TOO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: AS A RECENT
IMMIGRANT, HOW DO YOU FEEL...
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A
WHILE.
I WAS BORN HERE.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE BORN
HERE.
CAN I SAY IMMIGRANT BECAUSE IT
WILL MAKE THE INTERVIEW MORE
PICANT, YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
ARIZONA LAW?
I MEAN, YOU'RE A POLITICIAN.
YOU'RE IN TEXAS.
YOU GOT YOUR OWN LONG BORDER
THERE.
>> WE DO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU SUPPORT THE
ARIZONA LAW?
>> NEW YORK I DON'T.
I DON'T.
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S BAD
POLICY.
>>
>> Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO
PROTECT OUR BORDERS.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN PROTECTING
OUR BORDERS?
>> I DO.
IN TEXAS WE PROBABLY PROTECT 'EM
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A RIVER.
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU.
THE RIVER DOES ALL THE WORK.
WE PROTECT OURSELVESES FROM
EUROPE, TOO.
IT'S CALLED THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.
YOU'RE CHEATING, SIR.
>> THERE IS SOMETHING THERE, BUT
I THINK ARIZONA LAW COMES OUT OF
LEGITIMATE FRUSTRATION THAT
ARIZONANS HAVE.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
PHOENIX IS THE KIDNAPPING
CAPITAL OF AMERICA.
>> THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
THAT PASSES THROUGH ARIZONA,
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT BLOCKED THE ACCESS IN
CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, BUT AT THE
SAME TIME, I THINK THAT
LEGISLATION JUST WENT OVERBOARD.
IT WENT OVERBOARD IN A COUPLE
WAYS.
FIRST, BY ALLOWING ANY RESIDENT
OF ARIZONA, WHETHER THEY LIVE IN
A COUNTY OR NOT TO, SUE A POLICE
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
THAT THE LAW IS NOT BEING
ENFORCED PROPERLY, TALK ABOUT A
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER
EXAMPLE OF A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT
THAN THAT.
>> Stephen: I CAN SEE YOU FOR
SAYING THAT.
>> THAT MIGHT BE MORE FRIVOLOUS.
>> Stephen: SO YOU WERE BORN
IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU'RE HISPANIC.
YOU DON SPEAK SPANISH, DO YOU?
>> I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN I
SPEAK IT.
I SPEAK ENGLISH A LOT BETTER
THAN I SPEAK SPANISH.
>> Stephen: IF YOU'RE NOT A
NATURAL SPANISH SPEAKER
YOURSELF, WHY DO YOU INSIST ON
HOOL-YAN.
WHY NOT JEWL-YAN.
AREN'T YOU TRYING TO HAVE YOUR
FLAN AND EAT IT TOO?
>> IS THAT LIKE COAL
>>-BARE VERSUS
COL-BERT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I FIGURE I MIGHT AS WELL
PRONOUNCE IT THE WAY IT'S
MENTION TO BE PRONOUNCED.
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE TAKING SPANISH LESSONS.
>> I'M PRACTICING.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT
HELPS PRACTICING?
YOU WATCH DORA THE EXPLORER AND
YOU LEARN HOW TO SAY "WHERE IS
THE MAP?"
IT'S ALWAYS IN THE BACKPACK, BY
THE WAY.
YOU ARE THE MAYOR OF SAAB -- SAN
ANTONIO.
THE RIVERFRONT IS THERE.
THE ALAMO IS THERE.
DO YOU REMEMBER THE ALAMO?
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: I DO REMEMBER THE
ALAMO.
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER THE ALAMO
FOR?
I REMEMBER IT FOR KEEPING OUT
THE MEXICANS.
>> THERE WERE MONTERREY MEXICANS THAT
FOUGHT WITH TEXANS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
TEXIANS?
THEY DROPPED THE I WHEN THEY
BECAME A STATE?
>> TEXAS USED TO BE ITS OWN
COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: WOW, IF WRECK
PERRY HAS HIS WAY, ANY MINUTE
THEY'LL BE THEIR OWN COUNTRY
AGAIN.
>> I WON'T GO THERE.
>> Stephen: I WENT THERE FOR
YOU.
THAT'S OKAY.
SO YOU'RE A YOUNG GUY.
YOU GOT A NICE HEAD OF HAIR.
YOU'RE HISPANIC.
YOU COULD BE ELECTED THE
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, TRUE?
IT'S POSSIBLE.
IS IT POSSIBLE?
IT'S POSSIBLE.
>> ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE, BUT
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 29 STATEWIDE
OFFICES IN TEXAS, AND ALL 29 OF
THEM ARE FILLED BY A REPUBLICAN.
SO SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.
>> Stephen: THAT IS THE GIFT
OF GERRYMANDERING, MY FRIEND.
ARE YOU AFRAID SOMEONE FROM
MEXICO WILL COME OVER THE BORDER
AND TAKE YOUR JOB AS HISPANIC
MAYOR IN
>> THAT DOESN'T WORRY ME.
>> Stephen: THAT DOESN'T WORRY
YOU AT ALL IN YOU'RE A BRAVER
MAN THAN I AM.
