FOLKS, IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOUWITH US. FOR NOW.
IT'S DAY 29 OF AMERICA'S EBOLACRISIS.
JESUS!
OKAY.
PLEASE.
(LAUGHTER)JIMMY?
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)THIS THING IS GOING TO KILL US
ALL.
OF COURSE, I HAVE BEEN TRACKINGTHE VIRUS ON MY SEXY C.D.C.
TECHNICIAN CALENDAR.
I WOULD NOT MIND CATCHINGWHAT THAT GUY'S GOT.
I AM NOT -- I AM NOT -- I AM NOTSOMETHING.
I'M SURE I'LL GET TO IT IN AMINUTE.
(LAUGHTER)NOW I'M NOT ONE OF THESE
FEAR-MONGERERS  WHO WILL TELLYOU THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO
DIE.
JUST 90% OF YOU.
(LAUGHTER)THE OTHER 10% WILL LIVE IN A
POST-APOCALYPTIC AFTERSCAPERULED BY GANGS OF PSYCHOPATHIC
BIKER CHICKS WHO SERVE THE SPICELORD TARGOTH.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE THE EBOLA CRISIS JUST
HIT AMERICA WHERE WE LIVE.
IF BY "WE" YOU MEAN "I."
>> EBOLA HAS COME TO NEW YORK!
EBOLA NOW IN AMERICA'S LARGESTCITY.
>> A CONFIRMED CASE OF EBOLA INTHE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY.
>> Stephen: EBOLA HAS COME TONEW YORK!
AND IF THEY CAN SPREAD IT HERE,THEY'LL SPREAD IT EVERYWHERE!
(LAUGHTER)(SINGING)
>> I DON'T KNOW ALL THE WORDS TOTHAT SONG.
I'LL ADMIT IT.
BEFORE, I WASN'T REALLY WORRIEDBECAUSE EBOLA WAS ONLY IN
FARAWAY PLACES I'LL NEVER GO,LIKE LIBERIA OR DALLAS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT NOW, THE (BLEEP) HAS HIT THE
FAN.
WHICH IS THE NUMBER-ONE WAY TOSPREAD EBOLA!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I'VE JUST GOT TOCALM DOWN!
I'LL JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND GOTO MY HAPPY PLACE.
JESUS!
WHY DID I MAKE MY HAPPY PLACELIBERIA?!
NOW, THE PATIENT WHO'S KEEPINGTHE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS AWAKE
AT NIGHT IS A DOCTOR WHO JUSTRETURNED FROM TREATING EBOLA
PATIENTS IN GUINEA.
HE KNEW HE WAS AT RISK, SO UPONRETURNING FROM AFRICA, HE STAYED
HOME FROM WORK.
WHICH THOUGHTFULLY KEPT HIMAWAY FROM HIS CO-WORKERS...
AND GAVE HIM PLENTY OF TIME TOEXPLORE THIS MAGNIFICENT CITY!
>> OFFICIALS ARE NOW TRACING HISFAIRLY EXTENSIVE MOVEMENTS IN
THE HOURS BEFORE HIS DIAGNOSIS.
>> SPENCER STOPPED HERE IN THEGREENWICH VILLAGE AT THE
MEATBALL SHOP.
>> HE VISITED THE HIGH LINE, AVERY POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION
HERE.
>> WEDNESDAY, HE GOES ON ATHREE-MILE RUN.
>> Stephen: A THREE-MILE RUN?
HE WORKS OUT MORE THAN I DOWITHOUT EBOLA.
(LAUGHTER)AND THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.
>> WE JUST FOUND OUT HE RODEPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
>> HE RODE TWO, MAYBE THREEDIFFERENT SUBWAYS.
>> Stephen: GREAT!
EBOLA SPREADS BY TOUCHING BLOODOR FECES -- THOSE ARE YOUR ONLY
TWO SEATING OPTIONS ON THESUBWAY!
(LAUGHTER)THANKFULLY, THIS WON'T HAPPEN
AGAIN BECAUSE, ON FRIDAY,NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS
CHRISTIE AND NEW YORKGOVERNOR -- UH, ONE OF THE
CUOMOS -- HARPO?
(LAUGHTER)-- ANNOUNCED BOTH STATES WOULD
ENFORCE A MANDATORY 21-DAYQUARANTINE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS
COME INTO CONTACT WITH EBOLAPATIENTS, EVEN IF THEY HAVE NO
SYMPTOMS -- WHICH, I HEAR, ISTHE FIRST SYMPTOM.
(LAUGHTER)LEADING TO THE IMMEDIATE
QUARANTINE OF A NURSE RETURNINGFROM EBOLA-STRICKEN SIERRA
LEONE, KACI HICKOX, WHO, AFTERLANDING AT NEWARK AIRPORT,
UNDERWENT HOURS OFINTERROGATION, AND WHEN A
FOREHEAD SCANNER RECORDED HERTEMPERATURE AS 101 DEGREES,
AUTHORITIES LEFT HER IN THE ROOMFOR ANOTHER THREE HOURS.
STILL, BETTER THAN FLYING INTOLA GUARDIA.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
SHE WAS THEN TAKEN TO UNIVERSITYHOSPITAL IN NEWARK AND PLACED IN
A LUXURIOUS TENT STRUCTUREOUTSIDE WITH A PORTAPOTTY, NO
SHOWER AND NO CONNECTION TO THEOUTSIDE WORLD EXCEPT HER
iPhone.
BIG DEAL.
THROW IN A SPACE HEATER, A SIXEROF LABATTS, AND YOU'RE BASICALLY
ICE FISHING.
(LAUGHTER)UNFORTUNATELY, SHE USED HER
iPhone TO GRIPE TO THE MEDIAABOUT THE FORCIBLE IMPRISONMENT.
>> I HAVE BEEN ASYMPTOMATICSINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE.
I COMPLETELY DON'T UNDERSTANDIT.
IT'S NOT BASED ON ANY CLEARPUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE.
AND IT'S NOT THE RECOMMENDATIONOF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL
EXPERTS AT THIS POINT.
THIS IS AN EXTREME THAT ISREALLY UNACCEPTABLE, AND I FEEL
LIKE MY BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS HAVEBEEN VIOLATED.
>> Stephen: HUMAN RIGHTS?
I'M SORRY, MA'AM, BUT THECONSTITUTION DOES
NOT SAY YOU HAVE A RIGHT TOENDANGER YOUR NEIGHBORS.
UNLESS IT'S WITH A GUN.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
A LOT OF GUN FANS HERE TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)FACED WITH THIS OUTBREAK OF BAD
P.R., GOVERNOR -- OH,WHAT'S-HIS-CUOMO -- BACKED DOWN,
CHANGING NEW YORK'S RULE TO JUSTTHREE WEEKS WITHOUT LEAVING THE
HOUSE -- OR AS MOST PEOPLE CALLIT, "WAITING FOR TIME-WARNER
CABLE."
(LAUGHTER)AND NOW, NEW JERSEY IS LETTING
HICKOX GO HOME.
EVEN CHRISTIE HAS FOLDED LIKE AHASTILY-ERECTED EBOLA TENT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT HE KNOWS, ULTIMATELY,
EVERYONE WILL SEE HE DID THERIGHT THING.
>> I KNOW SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BETHERE.
BUT THE FACT IS I HAVE A MUCHGREATER, BIGGER RESPONSIBILITY
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE PUBLIC, SOI THINK, WHEN SHE HAS TIME TO
REFLECT, SHE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT,AS WELL.
>> Stephen: YES, SHE'LLUNDERSTAND WHEN SHE HAS MORE
TIME TO REFLECT THAN FOUR DAYSALONE IN A PLASTIC TENT.
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING,FOLKS!
BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLETO PROTECT OURSELVES ANYMORE.
JUST ASK THE CABLE NEWS!>> I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW I'M
GOING TO TAKE THIS PROTECTIVEEQUIPMENT OFF.
I'M ALSO GOING TO PUT A LITTLECHOCOLATE SAUCE IN MY HAND,
WHICH COULD REPRESENT A POSSIBLEEBOLA CONTAMINATION.
TAKE A LOOK.
PUT THE MASK BACK ON.
SO HERE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELYCONTAMINATED AREA, MY GLOVES,
MAYBE THE FRONT OF MY GOWN, ABIT LIKE THIS.
NOW I GOT TO TREAT THIS AS IFI'M POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED.
SO NOW TAKE A LOOK.
RIGHT THERE, SEE A LITTLE BIT OFCHOCOLATE SAUCE.
ONE POSSIBLE EXPOSURE.
AND OVER HERE ON MY NECK, ONEPOSSIBLE EXPOSURE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S TERRIFYING.
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOPEBOLA IS WETNAPS!
(LAUGHTER)GUPTA CLEARLY BLEW THE
PROTOCOLS.
SO NATION, ONCE AGAIN, IT FALLSTO ME TO PROPERLY DEMONSTRATE
HOW TO ISOLATE THIS VIRUS.
I'LL USE THIS BOWL OF VANILLAICE CREAM TO REPRESENT A STERILE
SEALED HOSPITAL ROOM.
NOW, SOMEONE WITH EBOLA COMESIN, THEY GOT THEIR BODILY
FLUIDS.
ALL RIGHT, ALL OVER THE STERILEROOM.
OBVIOUSLY, BLOOD IS ONE OF THEWAYS IT IS TRANSMITTED.
THEN, THIS IS THEIR SALIVA.
IT'S A LITTLE FROTHY.
THEY MIGHT HAVE RABIES AS WELL.
(LAUGHTER)THESE REPRESENT THEIR SNEEZE
PARTICLES, OKAY?
RIGHT THERE.
(LAUGHTER)AND ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF EBOLA
IS BLEEDING FROM THE EYEBALLS,SO...
THERE YOU GO.
(LAUGHTER)SO NOW YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE
DANGEROUS CONTAMINANTS TOGETHER.
BUT YOU CAN STAY SAFE, AS LONGAS YOU AVOID ALL CONTACT.
(LAUGHTER)THOUGH, I GOTTA SAY, THAT LOOKS
PRETTY GOOD.
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HURT TOHAVE A LITTLE EBOLA.
MM-MM-MM, MM-MMM...
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S MY EBOLA CHEAT DAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
