(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYONE.
THANK YOU.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FOUNDED
www.350.org TO FIGHT GLOBAL
WARMING.
HE MUST BE WINNING BECAUSE IT'S
KIND OF CHILLY OUT.
PLEASE WELCOME BILL McKIBBEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, BILL, THANKS FOR COMING
BACK.
ALL RIGHT, FIRM GRIP, MAN.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, I HAVE HAD YOU
ON THE SHOW.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
LET ME EXPLAIN TO THESE PEOPLE
THE TROUBLE MAKER THAT YOU ARE.
YOU ARE ALSO AN ENVIRONMENTALIST
ACTIVIST.
YOU WROTE "THE END OF NATURE"
YOU FOUNDED www.350.org AND YOU
LED THE EFFORT TO KILL THE
KEYSTONE X.L. PIPELINE AND
YOU'RE...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOUR PROFILE ON THE "BOSTON
GLOBE" "CAN THIS MAN SAVE THE
PLANET."
SO YOU'RE THE CLOWN WHO'S GOING
TO MAKE ME PAY FIVE BUCKS A
GALLON FOR GAS THIS SUMMER.
THAT'S YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
EVERYONE?
>> WITH ANY LUCK, WE'RE THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO HELP YOU
GET THE PLUG-IN HYBRID CAR THAT
DOES SO WELL ON GAS YOU FORGET
WHICH SIDE THE GAS TAP IS ON.
WE'RE MOVING IN NEW DIRECTIONS
NOW.
>> Stephen: LOOK, BUDDY, THANKS
TO YOU, I'VE GONE FROM AN AUDI
A. 8-L TO AN S-5.
(LAUGHTER)
DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL CAR.
IT'S A DROPPED OFF CABRIOLET.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP THE
PLANET WORKING SO THAT WHEN YOU
DROP THE TOP IT'S WORKING.
>> Stephen: THE PLANET STILL
TURNS.
EVERYTHING WE'RE EXTRACTING FROM
THE GROUND IS NATURAL.
RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S ALL NATURAL!
THAT OIL IS 100% CERTIFIED
ORGANIC.
(LAUGHTER)
IS IT NOT?
IS IT NOT ORGANIC?
>> IT'S ALL DINOSAURS.
THE TROUBLE IS WE'RE TAKING....
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THEY
SELL AT WHOLE FOODS.
>> WE'RE TAKING 200 MILLION
YEARS OF IT AND PUTTING IN THE
ATMOSPHERE AT ONCE.
THE TAR SANDS IN CANADA IS THE
PERFECT EXAMPLE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHERE THE
X.L. GOES.
THE TAR SANDS IN CAN DO D.A. TO
THE GULF STATES.
>> SECOND BIGGEST POOL AFTER
SAUDI ARABIA.
>> Stephen: YOU MEAN OIL.
>> IT WAS BURNING SAUDI ARABIA
THAT RAISED THE TEMPERATURE OF
THE PLANET ONE DEGREE.
IF WE... KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE DO THE SAME
THING WITH THE SECOND SAUDI
ARABIA WE'RE NOT AS WISE AS WE
LIKE TO THINK WE ARE SOMETIMES.
>> BUT YOU SAY WE HAVE TO GET
OFF THIS OIL, THIS CARBON.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
WE DO THAT?
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM WE
HAVE... YOU MAY SAY IT'S FLAWED
BUT IT'S GLOBAL, IT'S PROFITABLE
AND IT WORKS.
>> IT'S PROFITABLE AS HECK AND
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THE REASON THAT....
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S THE
PROBLEM?
THAT'S WHAT BUILDS A NATION.
>> THE REASON WE HAVE SO MUCH
TROUBLE IS BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL
POWERS OF FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY
HAS BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP SCIENCE
AT BAY.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ANY POWER.
YOU KILLED THE X.L. PIPELINE!
I'M WORRIED THEY DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH OF A SAY.
>> WELL, THE X.L. PIPELINE MAY
BE COMING BACK.
JUST TODAY WITH WORRIES THAT THE
SENATE WAS BEGINNING TO CAVE TO
BIG OIL WE LAUNCHED WHAT WE
THOUGHT WOULD BE A 24-HOUR DRIVE
TO TRY TO COLLECT HALF A MILLION
MESSAGES TO THE SENATE.
IN FACT, WE BLEW BY THAT HALF
MILLION MARK AFTER SIX HOURS
WITH COLBERTNATION ON BOARD FOR
THE NEXT 18 IT'S GOING TO BE
LIKE ONE OF THOSE OLD JIMMY
STEWART MOVIES WHERE THEY'RE
HAVING TO CARRY THE BUNDLES OF
TELEGRAMS INTO CONGRESS.
>> Stephen: YOU MEAN "IT'S A
WONDERFUL LIFE"?
>> THAT'S IT.
>> Stephen: WHERE HE TURNS OUT
TO BE A THIEF?
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T WATCH ALL THE
WAY TO THE END.
>> Stephen: I ONLY WATCHED HALF
OF IT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WE DON'T GET THAT OIL, THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENS.
WE DON'T GET THAT OIL.
>> HOPEFULLY.
AND MUCH OF THE COAL STAYS IN
THE GROUND.
>> Stephen: SO THE OIL INSTEAD
GOES TO CHINA.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: CHINA WILL BUY IT
AND FRANCE WILL BUY IT AND
GERMANY WILL BUY IT.
SO IT GOES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
BUT WE LOSE OUT.
>> EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO BUY IT
BUT THE YOU LOOK AT WHERE THOSE
TAR SANDS ARE, FOR INSTANCE,
THEY'RE A LONG WAYS FROM
ANYWHERE UP THERE IN ALBERTA.
>> Stephen: WHEREVER IN CANADA
IS A LONG WAY FROM ANYWHERE.
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD A
PIPELINE ALSO WEST TO THE
PACIFIC AND HENCE ON TO CHINA
BUT SO FAR CANADIAN ACTIVISTS
HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB OF
OPPOSING IT.
A MAJORITY OF CANADIANS OPPOSE
BUILDING THAT PIPELINE.
>> Stephen: CANADIAN ACTIVISTS?
THEY SAY "WOULD YOU MIND VERY
MUCH NOT BUILDING THAT PIPELINE
EH?
ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY?
SOORY."
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IF SOMEONE OUT THERE
IN THE AUDIENCE WAS FOOLISH YOU
HAVE NO SIGN YOUR PETITION,
WHERE WOULD THEY GO?
>> Www.350.org IS THE PLACE TO
BE.
>> Stephen: DO NOT DO IT!
