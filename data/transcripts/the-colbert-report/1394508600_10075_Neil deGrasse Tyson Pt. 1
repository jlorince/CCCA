ADULTS THAT ASK THEANNOYING QUESTION, WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROWUP.
BY THE TIME I WAS 11 I SAIDASTROPHYSICIST AND THEY
WOULD JUST WALK AWAY.
THEY QUICKLY ENDED THATCONVERSATION.
SO UNKNOWN TO ME, THEADMISSIONS OFFICE AT CORNELL
FORWARDED MY APPLICATION TOCARL SAGAN FOR HIM TO REACT.
AND HE THEN SENT ME APERSONAL LETTER, THERE IT
WAS, CARL-- HE HAD ALREADYBEEN ON THE TONIGHT SHOW,

TO CORNELL TO HELP ME DECIDEWHETHER I WOULD CHOOSE
CORNELL FOR MY COLLEGE.

I WENT UP, I WENT TO CORNELL,HE GREETED ME OUTSIDE.
AND WE WENT INTO HIS OFFICE,HE REACHED BACK, DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK, PULLED OUT ONE OF HISBOOKS, SIGNED IT TO ME, I
STILL HAVE THAT BOOK.
AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT WASJUST COOL.
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOKWHICH BOOK HE WAS PULLING
OUT AND HE WROTE THE BOOK,RIGHT.
SO, SO THEN HE TOOK ME BACKTO THE CORNELL, ITHACA, NEW
YORK, STARTED SNOWING AS ITALWAYS DOES.

THE BIRTH OF OUR UNIVERSE.
DID CONTAINS EVERYTHINGTHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN
UP TO NOW, WHICH ON THISCALENDAR IS MIDNIGHT
DECEMBER 31st.
ON THIS SCALE, EVERY MONTHREPRESENTS ABOUT A BILLION
YEARS.
EVERY DAY, REPRESENTS NEARLY40 MILLION YEARS.
LET'S GO BACK AS FAR AS WECAN TO THE VERY FIRST MOMENT
IN THE UNIVERSE.
JANUARY 1st.
THE BIG BANG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT'S AS FAR BACK AS WE CAN
SEE IN TIME.
FOR NOW.
>> Stephen: NOW HOW MUCHSUNSCREEN DID YOU HAVE TO
PUT ON BEFORE THEY EXPLODED.
>> THE FLAME PROOF SUIT.
>> Stephen: HERE'S WHAT BUGSME, OKAY, YOU SAY IN THAT
LITTLE THING THAT ALL OFHUMAN HISTORY IS THE LAST 14
SECONDS.
>> ALL WRITTEN HUMANHISTORY.
>> Stephen: IN THE LAST 14SECONDS OF THE CALENDAR YEAR,
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ANYTHINGHAPPENED BEFORE THOSE 14
SECONDS IF IT WASN'T WRITTENDOWN?
AREN'T YOU SCIENTISTS JUSTGUESSING ALL THAT STUFF?
LIKE THE BIG BANG, LIKE ALLOF THE REST OF THAT COSMIC
CALENDAR YEAR, ISN'T THATKIND OF JUST A
GUESSTIMICATION?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NO?
>> WE NEED WRITTEN HISTORYTO SEE WHO LIVES AND WHAT
THEY DID AS INDIVIDUALS ANDWHO WAS KING AND QUEEN
AND -->> HOW MUCH GRAIN THERE WAS.
>> THAT IS WHAT THEIRWRITTEN STUFF, WE DON'T NEED
THE WRITTEN STUFF TO TELL USABOUT THE GEOLOGY OR ASTRO
PHYSICS, IT'S JUST TO GETHUMAN ACTIVITIES ON THE MAP.
OTHERWISE, LEAVE IT OUT.
I WILL TELL YOU-- WHERE THERIVERS FLOWED, WHERE THE
SEDIMENTS WERE LAID.
WHERE THE-- WE GOT THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I'M JUST SAYING.
>> Stephen: IN LAST NIGHT'SSHOW, I'M-- YOU ALSO TOOK A
COUPLE OF POTSHOTS AT MYCATHOLIC CHURCH.
YOU MADE THE SLANDEROUSACCUSATION THAT THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH WAS RESPONSIBLE FORTHE DEATH OF SCIENTISTS AN
PEOPLE WITHOUT DID NOT AGREEWITH THE CHURCH WHERE.
DID YOU GET THESEACCUSATIONS OTHER THAN FROM
HISTORY BOOKS?
>> IN FACT, THE PEOPLE WHOPUT GEEDONEO BRUNO TO DEATH
WHO WAS OUR HERO OF THATSTORY, WAS NOT THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH T WAS THE ROMANAUTHORITIES AND WE SAY THAT.
>> OH REALLY.
>> YEAH.
SO-- WITH.
>> SO THE CATHOLIC CHURCHHAS BEEN GOOD FOR SCIENCE.
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.
>> TECHNICALLY THEIR HANDSARE CLEAN OF HIS DEATH
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BURN HIMAT THE STAKE, THE ROMAN
AUTHORITIES BURNED HIM ATTHE STAKE, TECHNICALLY
BUT THEY WERE EXECUTINGTHE-- I MEAN THAT WAS THE
PUNISHMENT.
>> Stephen: THEY WERE JUSTOBEYING ORDERS.
>> SO, SO THE POINT IS WEMADE IT CLEAR, IT WAS THE
INQUISITION THAT WASRESPONSIBLE HERE.
SO THAT'S A PIECE OF WHATWAS THEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
AND IT IS A PIECE THAT IS NOLONGER.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OFBEING BURNED AT THE STAKE
FOR THIS SHOW.
>> NO.
