>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, NATION, IF YOU
CHECK YOUR CALENDARS YOU WILLSEE THAT WE ARE A SCANT
986 DAYS AWAY FROM THE 2016PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
I AM FEELING PRETTY GOODABOUT THE GOP'S CHANCES.
WHILE THE DEMS ARE STUCKWITH HILLARY, THE
REPUBLICANS HAVE ANEMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES,
ALSO A LOT OF GREATCANDIDATES.
FOR INSTANCE, LOUISIANAGOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL, I CAN
TO THE SAY ENOUGH GREATTHINGS ABOUT THIS GUY.
SO I WILL NOT START.
(LAUGHTER)THEN THERE'S SENATOR RAND
PAUL, MANY HAVE CALLED HIMCONSTITUTIONALLY ELIGIBLE TO
RUN FOR OFFICE.
AND OF COURSE AS ALWAYSCHRIS CHRISTIE, YES, YES
HE'S IN A BIT OF A ROUGHPATCH RIGHT NOW.
BUT BY 2016 I'M SURE THISWHOLE SCANDAL IS JUST GOING
TO BE A BUMP IN THE-- IMEAN-- I MEAN-- I MEAN THE
WHOLE THING'S JUST GOING TOBE WATER UNDER THE--
(LAUGHTER)BUT WHOEVER THEY RUN,
HILLARY WILL NOT BE THEUNSTOPPABLE SHE-GERNAUT
REPUBLICANS, FOR THE RECORD,DO NOT FEAR.
BECAUSE FOX NEWS HAS JUSTUNCOVERED A BOMBSHELL OF A
LIFETIME.
>> HILLARY CLINTON COULDFACE AN OBSTACLE THAT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH HERHUSBAND'S PAST OR EVEN HER
OWN.
HOWARD KURTZ LOOKS AT THECONTROVERSIAL QUESTION OF
HOW OLD IS TOO OLD.
>> THE AGE QUESTION ISGROWING LOUDER THAN JUST A
WHISPER.
RAISED BY FORMER CANDIDATE ANDNOW FOX NEWS HOST MIKE
HUCKABEE.
>> LOOK, IF SHE'S GOING TOBE AT AN AGE WHERE IT'S
GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FORHER.
>> IF HILLARY CLINTON IS THEDEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT SHE'LL TURN 69JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,FOX NEWS IS READY TO PROJECT
THAT IN THE 2016PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE TWOYEARS OLDER.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN COME ON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: COME ON.
COME ON!
I MEAN 69, THAT IS OLD.
LIKE OLD, OLD.
WAY TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENT.
I MEAN SHE'S GOING TO BEALMOST AS OLD AS RONALD
REAGAN WAS.
BUT REMEMBER THOSE WERE MANYEARS.
MEN AGE GRACEFULLY LIKEROBERT REDFORD OR A NICE
LEATHER WALLET.
>> JIM, JIM, WHY DID YOU PUTUP TWO LEATHER WALLETS, I
DON'T-- OKAY, NOW PLUS, PLUSIT JUST GOES TO THE QUESTION
OF TRUST WORTHINESS.
DURING THE BENGHAZI HEARINGS,SHE KEPT CHANGING HER STORY.
FIRST SHE SAID SHE WAS 65.
NEXT YEAR SHE'S 66.
WHERE DOES IT STOP?
SO OBVIOUSLY THE DEVELOPINGSTORY AND WHAT'S THAT-- OKAY,
I'M BEING TOLD THATMRS. CLINTON IS NOW EVEN
OLDER THAN WHEN I BEGAN THISREPORT TWO MINUTES AGO.
I KNOW IT'S RUDE TO TALKABOUT A WOMAN'S AGE.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I AMDOING.
I AM TALKING ABOUT PEOPLETALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE
TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLETALKING ABOUT A WOMAN'S AGE.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S CALLED JOURNALISM.
WHEN IT COMES TO PICKING THELEADER OF THE FREE WORLD
YOU'VE GOT TO ASK THEIMPORTANT QUESTIONS LIKE
RUSH DOES.
>> WE PUT A PICTURE OFMRS. CLINTON UP AT
RUSHLIMBAUGH.COM.
AND WE SIMPLY ASK DOESAMERICA, DO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WANT TO OBSERVE THEAGING OF THIS WOMAN IN
OFFICE.
YIKES!
>> Stephen: THAT'S HOW SHELOOKS TODAY, IMAGINE HOW SHE
WOULD LOOK AT 73.
OOF!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THAT'S A BEST-- THAT'S A
BEST-CASE SCENARIO.
IN THE SECOND TERM, SHECOULD DETERIORATE INTO THIS.
(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER)
JIMMY, TAKE IT DOWN.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'TWANT TO OBSERVE THAT EVER
AGAIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
