IF AMAZON HAD BEEN IN CHARGEOF THE TRAVEL IT WOULD HAVE
TAKEN ME TWO TO FIVE WEEKSTO GET HERE.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
(APPLAUSE)>> THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE
THEY WON A MONOPOLY.
THEY CONTROL 40 TO 50% OFTHE BOOK MARKET AND THEY
WANT MORE.
AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DOTHAT IS BY FORCING THE PRICE
LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWERAND MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR
MORE AND MORE PUBLISHERS TOPUBLISH THEIR BOOK.
