(LAUGHTER)NATION, YOU WATCH THE SHOW, YOU
KNOW MY MIDDLE NAME IS "DANGER."
BUT MY FIRST NAME IS "WE'RE ALLIN" AND MY LAST NAME IS "RUN FOR
YOUR LIVES."
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS
UNDER ATTACK AND THIS TIME IT'SNOT JUST FROM THE GAYS--
ALTHOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY,THEY'RE NOT HELPING.
LOOK AT NEIL PATRICK HARRIS'FAMILY HALLOWEEN PHOTO.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)"COME TO MY HOUSE, I HAVE
FUN-SIZED SNICKERS."
(LAUGHTER)NO, THE REAL THREAT TO MARRIAGE
IS THREAT NUMBER THREE: DIVORCE.
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, DID YOU?
NOW, DIVORCE HAS NEVER BEENGREAT FOR A MARRIAGE, BUT
ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY,DIVORCE IS CONTAGIOUS.
WHICH I'VE SUSPECTED FOR A LONGTIME.
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS DID "LARRYKING LIVE" IN A HAZMAT SUIT
WHILE HOLDING A CANARY.
(LAUGHTER)I WAS OKAY.
(APPLAUSE)I WAS OKAY BUT LARRY DID HIT ON
THE CANARY.
(LAUGHTER)NO MEANS NO, LARRY.
NOW, ACCORDING TO A THREE-DECADESTUDY BY BROWN UNIVERSITY
RESEARCHERS-- ALTHOUGH REALLYIT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS WHAT
COLOR THEY WERE-- COUPLES WERE75% MORE LIKELY TO BECOME
DIVORCED IF A FRIEND IS DIVORCEDAND 33% MORE LIKELY TO DIVORCE
IF A FRIEND OF A FRIEND ENDS HISOR HER MARRIAGE.
AND I'M NOT SURPRISED.
I HAVE NEVER TRUSTED FRIENDS OFA FRIEND.
I MEAN, I'M MY FRIEND'S FRIEND.
WHO ARE THESE OTHER PEOPLE?
(LAUGHTER)RESEARCHERS SAY DIVORCE CAN
SPREAD LIKE AN EPIDEMIC THROUGHA SOCIAL NETWORK LIKE A RUMOR
AFFECTING FRIENDS UP TO TWODEGREES REMOVED!
THAT'S RIGHT!
DIVORCE CAN SPREAD LIKE CRABS ATTHEATER CAMP!
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ALWAYS SAIDDIVORCE SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.
ONCE A COUPLE STARTS HANGING OUTWITH NANCY WHO'S GOT A NEW LEASE
OF LIFE, LOOKS AMAZING AND ISSPENDING THANKSGIVING IN TURKS
AND CAICOS HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLYBE SATISFIED WITH YOUR SPOUSE
WHO IS SPENDING THANKSGIVINGWITH YOU?
(LAUGHTER)SO, FOLKS, PROTECT YOURSELF.
STAY OUT OF PLACES WHERE THOSEINFECTED WITH DIVORCE OFF
CONGREGATE: THE FROZEN FOODAISLE, DOG RUNS, MIATA
DEALERSHIPS, OR TRAVELINGTHROUGH THAILAND BECAUSE (BLEEP)

DOLLAR MENU.
McDONALD'S DOLLAR MENU ISGETTING A NEW NAME.
DOLLAR MENU AND MORE.
IT WILL INCLUDE EVERYTHING ONTHE CURRENT DOLLAR MENU ALONG
WITH PRICIER ITEMS LIKE A20-PIECE McNUT GETS FOR $5.
>> Stephen: YES, THE DOLLARMENU AND MORE.
OR WHAT OTHER RESTAURANTS CALL"THE MENU."
(LAUGHTER)AND IT'S ALL DUE TO CLIMATE
CHANGE.
LOOKY WHY.
RISING TEMPERATURES HAVE LED TODROUGHT CONDITIONS IN CATTLE
RANCHING STATES FORCING RANCHERSTO CULL HERDS AND PAY MORE FOR
FEED LEADING TO MORE EXPENSIVECATTLE ON THE MARKET.
WELL, IF CATTLE FEED HAS BECOMESO EXPENSIVE WHY DON'T THEY JUST
