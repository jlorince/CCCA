>> Colbert: BUT FOR ALL OF HIS TRIUMPH OVER THE GOTCHA QUESTIONS, THE UNFAIR UNRARES, THE SLIGHTLY TALLER CHAIRS, NONE
OF THAT IS HOW MITT WON THIS ONE .. NO, THIS FIGHT WAS OVER BEFORE IT BEGAN AS FOX NEWS.COM TRUMPETED ROMNEY SMOKES OBAMA IN
PREDEBATE COIN TOSSES.
>> YEAH.
ROMNEY SMOKED HIM.
HE WON THREE OUT OF FOUR COIN TOSSES.
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?  LIKE ONE IN A MILLION?
>> COIN TOSS, ALWAYS A HUGE PART OF THE DEBATES SINCE THE LINCOLN DOUGLAS ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
WENDT ON FOR HOURS WITHOUT A WINNER THEY HAD TO SETTLE IT AND ENDED UP FLIPPING A PENNY AND LINCOLN WON BY CALLING ME!  KNOW
THE FOUR FLIPS THAT LAST NIGHT WERE TO STAGING, ORDER OF QUESTIONING AND SPOUSES ORDER OF INTRODUCTION.
ROMNEY WON THE COIN TOSSES THE SAME WAY HE IS WINNING THIS ELECTION, BY CALLING HEADS OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THEN CALLING
TAILS LIKE HE ALWAYS HAS!  FOLKS, THERE IS A GOOD SIGN, FOLKS, THIS IS A GOOD SIGN FOR ROMNEY'S CHANCES WITH UNDECIDED
VOTERS, BECAUSE IFFY POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN YOU ARE STILL UNDECIDED, JUST FLIP A GODDAMN COIN ALREADY.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
