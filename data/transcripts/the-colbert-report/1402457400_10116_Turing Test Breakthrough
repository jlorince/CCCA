[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THEREPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NATION, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
IN THE STUDIO, OUT THERE ATHOME.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO OUR VIEWERSWATCHING AT HOME.
PLEASE, NATION, DON'T MAKE ANYSUDDEN MOVES, BECAUSE YOU ARE
CURRENTLY IN DANGER OF ASOULLESS ENEMY THAT WANTS YOU
DEAD, AND THIS TIME I DON'T MEANYOUR CAT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.
BECAUSE THE MACHINES THAT WETRUST ARE ABOUT TO TURN ON US.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, ACOMPUTER PROGRAM HAS PASSED THE
ICONIC TURING TEST, FOOLINGPEOPLE BASICALLY INTO THINKING
IT'S A HUMAN.
>> COMPUTERS CAN NOW PASS FORHUMAN.
KISS YOUR LOVED ONES GOOD-BYEAND UNPLUG YOUR HOME-
ELECTRONICS, ASSUMING YOU CANSTILL TELL THEM APART, BECAUSE,
FOLKS, THIS COMPUTER MANAGED TOFOOL 33% OF HUMAN QUESTIONERS BY
DISGUISING ITSELF AS A13-YEAR-OLD BOY, WHICH MAKES
SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
LIKE A TEENAGE BOY, A COMPUTERSLEEPS A LOT AND SPENDS ALL DAY
ON THE INTERNET.
NOW THE ROBO-LUTION IS UPON USAND CANNOT BE STOPPED.
IT'S A CLASSIC TALE OF HUMANSCREATING THE VERY THING THAT
WILL DESTROY US, JUST LIKE THEROMANS DID WHEN THEY INVENTED
GAY PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]JESUS TRIED TO WARN THEM.
THAT'S WHY THEY CRUCIFIED HIM,JUST TO KEEP HIM QUIET.
LOOK IT UP.
YOU WON'T FIND IT IN THE BIBLEBECAUSE IT WORKED.
IT WAS THE NEXT THING HE WASGONNA TALK ABOUT.
