>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THEREPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGUS.
NATION-- THANK YOU.
FOLKS, IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVEYOU IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL
AROUND THE WORLD.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE TOSAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I KNOW
THIS IS NOT GOING TO COME TO ANYSURPRISE TO ALL YOU HEROES OUT
THERE BUT I'VE HAD IT UP TO HEREWITH RUSSIA.
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS BEENOUT-MASCULATING BARACK OBAMA AT
EVERY TURN.
IT'S LIKE OBAMA IS PLAYINGCHECKERS, AND PUTIN IS ALSO
PLAYING CHECKERS BUT DOING ITSHIRTLESS WHILE RIDING A HORSE.
PUTIN'S STREAK OF MAN-CHIEVEMENTCONTINUED ON SATURDAY
>> RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIRPUTIN WAS BUSY PLAYING HOCKEY IN
SOCHI.
THE GAME REPORTEDLY AIRED ONRUSSIAN TELEVISION SATURDAY
NIGHT.
PRESIDENT PUTIN SUPPOSEDLY LED ATEAM OF HOCKEY STARS, INCLUDING
FORMER NHL-ERS TO A 24-1 WIN.
>> HE SHOOTS. HE SCORES.
SPECTATORS SAW THAT EARLYAND OFTEN FROM AN EXHIBITION
HOCKEY GAME.
>> PUTIN DAZZLED THE CROWD, WASABLE TO SCORE SIX GOALS IN A
SINGLE GAME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  THE OTHER TEAM--THE OTHER TEAM WOULD HAVE TRIED
TO STOP PUTIN, BUT HIS GAMESOFTEN END IN SUDDEN DEATH.
( LAUGHTER )NOW JUST TAKE A LOOK AT PUTIN IN
A SHOW MANY ARE CALLING"DICTATOR ON ICE."
HE'S SUCH A SPEED DEMON, THEPROFESSIONAL GOALIES TRIP OVER
THEIR OWN SKATES AS SOON AS HEAPPROACHES.
BUT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THINGABOUT PUTIN'S PERFORMANCE IS
THAT IT WAS ONLY SIX YEARS AGOTHAT HE LEARNED TO SKATE.
AND THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HISHOCKEY TRAINING WERE SPENT
PUTTING THE HELMET ON BACKWARDS.
WHILE HE'S HITTING SLAPSHOTS,WE'RE SLAPPING HIM WITH
SANCTIONS.
IN RESPONSE, PUTIN HAS THROWN AHIGH-STAKES HISSY FIT.
>> RUSSIA ANNOUNCED TODAY ITWOULD KEEP U.S. ASTRONAUTS OFF
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATIONAFTER THE YEAR 2020.
THE PROBLEM IS, THE RUSSIANS ARETHE ONLY WAY TO GET THERE.
THE AMERICANS HITCH A RIDE ONTHE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT.
THE TWO NATIONS HAVE COOPERATEDIN SPACE FOR OVER TWO DECADES
>> THEY'RE CUTTING OFFAMERICA'S ACCESS TO THE SPACE
STATION, VLADIMIR PUTIN FIRINGBACK OVER UKRAINE SANCTIONS
SAYING RUSSIA WILL NOT HELPLAUNCH AMERICANS INTO SPACE PAST
2020.
>> Stephen:  RUSSIA-- OUR SPACEBOYFRIENDS BROKE UP WITH US
AND, OF COURSE, THE WORST PARTOF EVERY BREAKUP IS CANCELLING
THE TRIP YOU HAD PLANNED FOR SIXYEARS FROM NOW.
THIS IS SO AWKWARD BECAUSE RIGHTNOW RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN
ASTRONAUTS ARE UP THERETOGETHER.
WE'RE STILL LIVING TOGETHER INTHE SAME PLACE.
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ALL WEIRDBUMPING INTO EACH OTHER WHEN WE
NEED TO USE THE WASTE VENT.
THE RUSSIANS AREN'T JUSTBREAKING UP WITH US.
THEY'RE MOCKING US.
