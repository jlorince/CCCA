EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, WE WERE ON VACATION FOR A
WEEK, AND, AS USUAL, THE BIGGEST
STORIES HAPPEN WHEN I'M OFF THE
AIR.
FOR INSTANCE, WHILE WE WERE
AWAY, NPR FIRED JUAN WILLIAMS.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
THEY FIRED HIM FOR SAYING ON
O'REILLY THAT MUSLIMS MAKE HIM
NERVOUS.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS RUPERT
MURDOCH GAVE JUAN A GREAT JOB
OVER AT FOX NEWS, SO NOW JUAN
WILLIAMS WILL NEVER HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT SEEING MUSLIMS
AGAIN.
( LAUGHTER )
UNLESS HE GOES TO A FOX
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THERE WAS AN EVEN BIGGER
STORY LAST WEEK THAT WE WERE
UNABLE TO COVER.
"THE COLBERT REPORT'S" FIFTH
ANNIVERSARY.
WE CONTINUE TO DO IT!
WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOOOOOO!
ME-S-A.
M-S-A.
ME-S-A.
YES, YES.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW I'VE
WON TONS OF AWARDS OVER THE LAST
FIVE YEARS, BUT, FOLKS, I DON'T
DO THIS SHOW FOR THE AWARDS.
I DO IT FOR THE HEROES.
AND WHO ARE THE HEROES?
THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE ME AWARDS.
THIS IS "WHO'S HONORING ME NOW."
( APPLAUSE )
FIRST UP, AN AWARD I'VE DREAMT
OF RECEIVING SINCE THIS SHOW
BEGAN, IT IS THE COVETED
"COLBERT NATION FIVE YEARS OF
EXCELLENCE AWARD," AN ACTUAL
CRYSTAL EAGLE TROPHY CREATED AND
SENT TO ME BY MEMBERS OF THE
COLBERT NATION FROM ALL OVER THE
UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE
WORLD.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY WHO SENT ME
THIS AWARD.
I GOT TO SAY THAT GETTING THE
COLBERT NATION FIVE YEAR OF
EXCELLENCE AWARD IS USUALLY
SWEET BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST FOUR
YEARS IT WAS WON BY JON STEWART.
[BLEEPED] BUDDY.
OKAY.
LAST WEEK I ALSO WON THE
PRESTIGIOUS BALD HERO AWARD OR
THE UBI.
IT WAS AWARDED TO ME BY AN ARMY
OF DEVOTED FAN GIRLS WHO
INCLUDED THIS NOTE
CONGRATULATING ME ON FIVE YEARS
OF SEXELLENCE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
LOVE.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SEXPRESSION.
I SHOULD TAKE YOU LADIES OUT TO
DINNER MAYBE FOR SOME SPICY SEX
MENTION.
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THESE TWO
BALLS UP HERE ARE NOT ACTUAL
SIZE, BUT THE WEIGHT IS RIGHT,
THOUGH.
AND TO THANK THE NATION FOR FIVE
WONDERFUL YEARS, THE STAFF AND I
HAVE POURED OVER THE LAST 785
SHOWS AND ASSEMBLED A MONTAGE OF
THE MOST MEANINGFUL, MOST
WORLD-CHANGING MOMENTS.
SO RIGHT NOW I AM PROUD TO
PRESENT "THE BEST OF THE TOP OF
THE CREME OF WHAT WE HAD TIME TO
THROW TOGETHER GET OFF OUR BACKS
WE'RE DAG RALLY IN FIVE DAYS."
>> I'LL SPEAK TO YOU IN PLAIN
SIMPLE ENGLISH.
[BABBLING]
CLEAR
( LAUGHTER ]
EMMY!
STEWART!
ROSENSTEIN!
OBAMA!
GORE!
CAN WE PLEASE PUT IT UP THERE,
PLEASE.
SCORE!
KANYE!
ANYONE CAN READ THE NEWS TO YOU.
I PROMISE TO FEEL THE NEWS AT
YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
I'M NOT CRYING.
I JUST HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION
WHERE WATER KEEPS FALLING OUT OF
MY EYES.
I'M FAT.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY EYES
TODAY?
IS THERE A CAT IN HERE?
THIS JUST FEELS SO RIGHT.
