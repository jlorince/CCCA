(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY. NATION, IF YOU KNOWME, YOU KNOW I LOVE SPORT.
I ALSO LOVE PRETENDING THAT ILOVE THINGS THAT I DON'T.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT!
FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET THE N.F.L.
HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY CONTROVERSY.
THERE ARE GROWING CONCERNS OVERTHE SAFETY OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS,
AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF PEOPLEWHO KNOW FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
SO I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT ANEW ALTERNATIVE TO FOOTBALL --
MORE FOOTBALL.
>> FXFL IS HERE.
THREE MAJOR CITIES, NEW YORK,BOSTON, OMAHA.
AS SOME OF THE BEST TALENT INTHE COUNTRY IS ON CENTER STAGE,
LOOKING TO KEEP THEIR PROFOOTBALL DREAMS ALIVE.
>> YOUR HEART BEATS TOGETHER ASONE!
>> WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE GAME.
>> Stephen: YES, THE FXFL,WHICH STANDS FOR "FALL
EXPERIMENTAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,"AND IT'S COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF
PLAYERS RELEASED DURING OR AFTERTHE N.F.L. PRE-SEASON.
PERFECT!
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU WATCHED ACOLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME AND SAID,
I WISH THE PLAYERS WERE BETTER.
THEN WATCHED AN N.F.L. GAME ANDSAID, NO, NOT THIS GOOD.
SWEET SPOT. THE FXFL HAS FOURTEAMS, THE
OMAHA MAMMOTHS, THE BROOKLYNBOLTS, THE BOSTON BRAWLERS, AND
IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN ONE OFTHOSE CITIES, YOU CAN ROOT FOR
THE BLACKTIPS...
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A HOMECITY AND ARE, INSTEAD, "A ROVING
ALL-STAR TEAM THAT WILL PLAY ALLITS GAMES ON THE ROAD."
THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE THE HARLEMGLOBETROTTERS, EXCEPT THE
GLOBETROTTERS ARE BETTER ATFOOTBALL.
AND THE FXFL WILL PROVIDE AVIABLE PLATFORM FOR MARGINAL
PLAYERS TO RECEIVE LIVETRAINING, ULTIMATELY GIVING THE
N.F.L. TEAMS BETTER-PREPAREDIN-SEASON ROSTER REPLACEMENTS.
AND THE LEAGUE HOPES THAT 25 TO30% OF FXFL PLAYERS RETURN TO
THE N.F.L. THIS FALL.
GREAT SELLING POINT.
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO WATCH ASPORT WHERE, WEEK BY WEEK, ALL
THE GOOD PLAYERS LEAVE?
AND THE COMPETITION WILL BEFIERCE BECAUSE THE SEASON'S ONLY
SIX WEEKS, WITH GAMES ONWEDNESDAY NIGHTS.
WHICH IS PERFECT AGAIN BECAUSEWEDNESDAY IS THE NIGHT I START
THE PROCESS OF LOOKING INSIDEMYSELF AND TRY TO HONESTLY
ASCERTAIN MY READINESS FOR SOMEFOOTBALL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
NATION -- ANOTHER NEW FOOTBALLLEAGUE?
WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE USFL, THEUFL, THE NFL EUROPE AND THE XFL.
AND ALL OF THOSE LEAGUES FAILED,BUT THE FXFL WILL BE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE THEY ADDED AN "F," THELETTER SYNONYMOUS WITH SUCCESS!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
