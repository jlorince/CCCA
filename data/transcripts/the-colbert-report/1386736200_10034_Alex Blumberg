EXPORTING COTTON.
NUMBER ONE COTTON EXPORTER INTHE WORLD.

Stephen: REALLY.
IT'S MADE IN BANGLADESH.
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS SWEAT.
>> SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGSWE WANTED TO LOOK AT.
SO IN BANGLADESH THERE ISSOMETHING TO WHAT YOU SAY.
BASICALLY -->> Stephen: GENERALLY.
>> -- BECAUSE BANGLADESH IS AINCREDIBLY POOR COUNTRY.
WE INTERVIEWED A PERSON, THE CEOOF A GARMENT MANUFACTURING
COMPANY.
HE SAYS OUR GOVERNMENT TPO +LGFOLLOWS POVERTY.
IT GOES TO THE POOREST COUNTRYIN THE WORLD OF HRAEUB TORE MAKE
THE SHIRTS.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT ASWEATSHOP.
WHAT IS YOUR STANDARD FORSWEATSHOPS.
>> WHEN YOU HAVE A COUNTRY LIKEBANGLADESH WHERE YOU HAVE
MILLIONS IN ABJECT POVERTY.
YOU HAVE A BIG CORPORATION, THEYCAN BE EXPLOITED.
ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE AREMILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN
POVERTY AND THE GARMENT INDUSTRYIS SMALL BUT A SIGNIFICANT STEP
ABOVE -->> Stephen: BY EXPORTING OUR
GARMENT WORK TO BANGLADESH AREWE HELPING THESE PEOPLE OR
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE?
>> IT'S A REALLY FINE LINE.
SOMETIMES WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGEOF THEM.
SOMETIMES WE'RE HELPING THEM.
THE PEOPLE IN BANGLADESH, MOSTPEOPLE, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WORKING INTHE GARMENT INDUSTRY OF
BANGLADESH.
THEY'RE CONSIDERED GOOD JOBS.

WANT A JOB IN ONE.

WAGES.

BANGLADESH.

OF THEM ANYMORE?
CAN WE MOVE TO THE FOURTH WORLDAT THIS POINT.
DO WE MOVE TO ANTARCTICA ANDTEACH THE PENGUINS TO SEW?

OUR GARMENTS HAVE GOTTEN CHEAPERAND CHEAPER.
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE TOGO TO PAY WORKERS LESS.

WE FIRE THEM OUT OF AN ONS ATDRUNK PEOPLE.
>> WE INTERVIEWED A GUY WHOBOUGHT T SHIRTS BECAUSE HE
DIDN'T WANT TO DO LAUNDRY.
>> Stephen: HE'S BURNING HISCLOTHES.
>> YES, THAT'S HOW CHEAP OURCLOTHES ARE.
I THINK THE TREND IS AT AN ENDNOW.
IT SEEMS THAT BANGLADESH IS THECHEAPEST PLACE.
>> Stephen: THERE ISN'T ACHEAPER PLACE?
I THOUGHT THEY HAD FACTORY SHIPSTHAT PULLED UP TO A PORT IN A
CITY AND SAID COME ON YOUDESPERATE PEOPLE MAKE OUR
CLOTHES.
IF YOU ASK FOR HIGHER WAGES WEWILL TAKE THE SHIP SOMEWHERE
ELSEWHERE THEY WON'T ASK.
