FOLKS( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOLKS, IT IS ALWAYS-- THANK YOUFOR THAT GREETING.
YOU KNOW I NEED IT.
I NEED YOUR ENERGY.
THE HEROES-- THE HEROS AREALWAYS UP FOR MAKING THE WORLD A
BETTER PLACE.
THANK YOU-- THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE WITH US.
THAT IS, IF YOU ARE STILL WITHUS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )I ASSUME EVERYONE WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI HAS BEEN QUARANTINEDIN THE EBOLA AFTERSCAPE.
WE WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE OFTHAT CRISIS TOMORROW, IF THERE
IS A TOMORROW.
IN THE MEANTIME, NO ONE TOUCHME.
( LAUGHTER )BUT FIRST, NATION, AS A NEWSMAN,
I ALWAYS KEEP TABS ON THEHEADLINES OUT OF CHINA.
I CAN'T READ THEM, BUT I GET THEGIST-- LOOKS LIKE AN IKEA
DRESSER WENT OFF A SKI JUMP.
IT'S PROBABLY THE SPORTSSECTION.
I DON'T KNOW.
AND THE LATEST NEWS OUT OF HONGKONG HAS ME WORRIED ABOUT ITS
RESIDENTS' SAFETY...
IN BED...
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND EVERYWHERE ELSE.
>> MASSIVE PROTESTS FILLING THESTREETS OF
HONG KONG.
>> TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESEDEMONSTRATORS HAVE PACKED INTO
THE HIGHWAYS AND STREETS, MOSTLYIN THE CITY'S CENTRAL FINANCIAL
DISTRICT.
>> THEY CLASHED WITH POLICEWHO REPORTEDLY POINTED LONG-
BARRELED GUNS AND USED TEAR GASFOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.
>> STEPHEN: YES, PROTESTORS INHONG KONG ARE BEING ATTACKED
WITH TEAR GAS.
OR AS IT'S KNOWN INCHINA, THE SKY.
( LAUGHTER )THE PROTESTS HERE, IT'S ALL
ABOUT DEMOCRACY
YOU SEE, AFTER CHINA TOOKCONTROL OF HONG KONG FROM
GREAT BRITAIN IN THE LATE 90S,THEY PROMISED "FREE ELECTIONS
FOR HONG KONG'S CHIEF EXECUTIVEIN 2017.
BUT NOW BEIJING SAYS "CANDIDATESMUST BE HAND PICKED BY A
COMMITTEE OF PRO-GOVERNMENTTYCOONS."
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
AMERICANS KNOW CANDIDATES MUSTBE PICKED BY ANTIGOVERNMENT
TYCOONS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE,
GENTLEMEN.
SO THOUSANDS OF HONG KONGOLESEHAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS IN A
COLLECTIVE ACTION THE "NEW YORKTIMES" CALLS, "A CHALLENGE TO
XI JINPING'S RULE," THEASSOCIATED PRESS DESCRIBES AS
"AN UNPRECEDENTED SHOW OF CIVILDISOBEDIENCE," AND THE OFFICIAL
STATE PAPER "CHINA DAILY"DOWNPLAYED IN FAVOR OF THE
BIGGER NEWS THAT 10,000 PIGEONSWERE GIVEN ANAL SECURITY CHECKS
LEADING UP TO CELEBRATIONS FORCHINA'S NATIONAL DAY.
THAT'S RIGHT, 10,000  CHINESEPIGEONS WERE ANALLY PROBED.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, FOLKS, I-- I AM NO--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )I AM NOT EXPERT ON THE CHINESE
ZODIAC, BUT I KNOW WHOSEYEAR IT'S NOT.
( LAUGHTER )WELL, NATION, I STAND WITH THE
PEOPLE OF HONG KONG!
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED ALL THESUPPORT THEY CAN GET, TOO,
BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME THECHINESE PEOPLE STOOD UP TO
OPPRESSION.
AND IF YOU DO NOT REMEMBER, HEADOVER TO THE BODIES EXHIBIT.
BUT I HOPE THE CHINESEGOVERNMENT IS LISTENING BECAUSE,
GENTLEMEN, THE WORLDIS WATCHING, AND YOU HAVE A
CHOICE HERE:   YOU CAN CRUSHTHESE PROTESTORS UNDER YOUR
HEEL, OR YOU CAN DO THE RIGHTTHING AND GRANT THEM THE RIGHTS
THEY WERE PROMISED.
THINK CAREFULLY, BECAUSEWHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE, AMERICA
WILL STILL DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
( LAUGHTER )I MEAN, HELL, WE'LL DO
"TRANSFORMERS 5" JUST FOR YOU.
THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY DIALOGUE INTHIS ONE!
AND BUMBLEBEE HAS SOME HARSHWORDS FOR JAPAN'S FALSE CLAIMS
TO THE SENKAKU ISLANDS.
SO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, AS LONGAS
YOUR FACTORIES KEEP PUMPING OUTTHESE LITTLE BABIES OUT, OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
