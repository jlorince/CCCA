(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN").
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU STPWH-FRPBLGT THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, FOLKS, WHEN YOU
ARE CHANTING MY NAME LIKE THAT,
YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE DOROTHY IN
MUNCHKINLAND.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, I KNOW AMERICA HAS TAKEN
SOME LICKS.
BUT DESPITE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
BEST EFFORTS TO KEEP US DOWN, WE
ARE NOW OFFICIALLY BACK ON TOP,
BABY!
DOING WHAT WE DO BEST-- PUNCHING
EUROPEAN ROYALTY.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> THE PRINCE OF MONOCORPS WAS
BRIEFLY HOSPITALIZED AFTER A
BRAWL AT A NEW YORK CITY
NIGHTCLUB.
HE AND HIS PLAYBOY PALS
APPARENTLY GOT A BEATDOWN AT A
CLUB IN THE MEAT PACKING
DISTRICT ON SATURDAY.
>> Stephen: BOOM!
THAT IS RIGHT!
PRETTY BOY, HIS HIGHNESS, GOT
MEAT-PACKED.
(LAUGHTER)
PRINCE CREME BRAWL-EE, HERE, OF
MONACO, MADE THE MISTAKE OF
GETTING IN THE FACE OF
ALL-AMERICAN SUPERDOUCHE ADAM
HOCK SEEN HERE RESTING HIS
PRINCE POUNDER IN A SMACKING
SLING.
(LAUGHTER)
HOCK IS THE FORMER OWNER OF
HAWAIIAN TROPIC ZONE.
THE MAN IS A NATIONAL TREASURE,
A PIONEER IN THE FIELD OF SUN
BLOCK RELATED RESTAURANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS WAS YOUR CLASSIC SHOWDOWN
OF MONEYED FOREIGN PLAYBOY
VERSUS BIKINI RESTAURANT OWNER
AND MR. HOCK HAD NO CHOICE BUT
TO RESPOND AFTER THE PRINCE OF
MONACO AND HIS COURT CROSSED A
LINE BY HELPING THEMSELVES TO
HOCK'S $500 TABLE SERVICE BOTTLE
OF GREY GOOSE VODKA.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T
FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW YORK CLUB
SCENE, LET A PLAYA EXPLAIN TO
YOU...
(LAUGHTER).
... HOW A BOTTLE OF VODKA YOU
GET IN THE STORE FOR $35 CAN
COST $500.
YOU SEE, THEY BRING IT TO YOUR
TABLE AND IT COSTS $500.
(LAUGHTER)
BOTTOM LINE IS, HOCK WON, OKAY?
HOCK WON!
OUR DOUCHEBAG BEAT UP THEIR
DOUCHEBAG.
DOUCHE.S.A.
DOUCHES.A.!
YES!
THANK YOU, FINDLESS MOB.
(LAUGHTER)
WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN PROVEN THAT
AMERICA HAS THE FINEST
DOUCHEBAGS IN THE WORLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE OUR DOUCHEBAGS DON'T
INHERIT THEIR DOUCHEBAGGERY.
IT'S NOT JUST HANDED TO THEM!
THEY EARN EVERY OUNCE OF THE
DOUCHE!
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH IS WHY MR. HOCK DIDN'T
JUST CROWN THE PRINCE, HE ALSO
DECKED HIS THREE PRIVILEGED
PALS.
THAT'S RIGHT, HE FLUSHED THE
ROYAL ENTOURAGE INCLUDING PARIS
HILTON'S EX-BOYFRIEND STAVROS
NIARCHOS, SEEN HERE SHOWING WHY
GREECE HAS COLLAPSED.
(LAUGHTER)
SCENESTER DIEGO MARROQUIN AND--
I'M GOING TO SAY TURTLE.
(LAUGHTER)
SO TAKE NOTICE, ENTITLED
MONARCHIES: AMERICA IS BACK IN
FIGHTING FORM!
YOU MESS WITH US, WE'RE GONNA
MAKE YOU BLACK AND BLUE BLOODS.
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU ARE A
SAUDI PRINCE, IN WHICH CASE THE
VODKA IS COMPED, GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE ENJOY
