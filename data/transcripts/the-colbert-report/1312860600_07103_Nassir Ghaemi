>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW
BOOK CALLED A FIRST RATE
MADNESS WHICH I BELIEVE
STANDARD & POOR'S HAS JUST
DOWNGRADE FORD A THIRD RATE
INSANITY.
PLEASE WELCOME DR. NASSIER
GOMI.
HELLO, DOCTOR.
>> HI.
>> BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
NOW, SIR, YOU HAVE A BOLD
PROPOSITION.
>> YES.
>> IN YOUR NEW BOOK.
FIRST YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF
PSYCHIATRY, TUFTS MEDICAL
CENTRE IN BOSTON.
YOU ALSO HAVE A POSITION AT
HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, I
BELIEVE.
AND YOU DIRECT THE MOOD
DISORDERS PROGRAM AT TUFTS
MEDICAL IN BOSTON.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED A
FIRST RATE MADNESS.
UNCOVERING THE LINKS BETWEEN
LEADERSHIP AND MENTAL
ILLNESS.
YOU SAY IN TIMES OF CRISIS
IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING
FOR OUR LEADERS TO BE A
LITTLE UNHINGED.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU SHOULD HAVE A MAD MAN
WITH HIS FINGER ON THE
BUTTON.
>> TO KEEP US SAFE.
>> THAT'S ONE WAY OF PUTTING
IT.
>> Stephen: I CAN'T THINK OF
ANOTHER.
WHAT DO MEAN.
WHY IS-- WHY IS A FIRST RATE
MADNESS A GOOD IDEA?
>> WELL, WHAT I FOUND WAS
THAT A LOT OF OUR GREATEST
LEADERS HAVE MENTAL
ILLNESSES OR ARE MENTALLY
ABNORMALLAL AND A LOT OF OUR
ABNORMAL AND A LOT OF OUR
WORST LEADERS ARE MENTALLY
HEALTHY.
AND THERE'S EVIDENCE FROM
DIFFERENT STUDIES AND
PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS TO
SOME MENTAL ILLNESSES, NOT
ALL OF THEM, LIKE MANIA AND
DEPRESSION.
FOR INSTANCE MANIC PEOPLE
TEND TO BE MORE CREATIVE
THAN NORMAL PEOPLE.
DEPRESSED PEOPLE TEND TO
HAVE MORE EMPATHY.
AND ARE MORE REALISTIC IN
EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN
THEIR ASSESSMENT
OF THEIR CONTROL OF THE
ENVIRONMENT.
>> SO A MANIC-DEPRESSIVE
PERSON HAS THE WHOLE
PACKAGE.
>> RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY HAVE THE MANIA, THEY
HAVE THE EGO YOU MIGHT SAY
TO THINK HEY, I COULD BE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
COULD RUN THINGS.
>> NOT SO MUCH THAT.
I THINK A LOT OF NORMAL
PEOPLE HAVE AMBITION AND
WANT POWER.
THE MANIC PATIENTS, PEOPLE
ARE MORE CREATIVE.
AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS, YOU
NEED THAT KIND OF CREATIVITY.
>> Stephen: WHO IS THE
PRESIDENT WHO SHOWED A MANIC
CREATIVITY IN TIMES OF
CRISIS.
>> FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
HE HAD MILD MANIC SYSTEMS
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE WHICH
PSYCHIATRISTS CALL
HYPERTHALAMIC PERSONALITY
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS AN
ACCIDENT THAT HE CAME UP
WITH ALL OF THE THINGS THAT
HE DID IN THE NEW DEAL.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE
AGREEING WITH ME, THAT THE
NEW DEAL WAS THE WORK OF A
MADMAN?
(LAUGHTER)
SOCIAL SECURITY, WORK
PROGRESSION ADMINISTRATION
GOVERNMENT CREATING JOBS IS
A MAD IDEA.
>> IT WAS A BRILLIANT MAD
IDEA.
>> Stephen: YOU MAKE HIM
SOUND LIKE A MAD SCIENTIST.
>> NO, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE
THINGS ABOUT MANIA IS THAT
IT DOES CAUSE A PERSON TO
HAVE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF
THOUGHTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE
CREATIVE.
CONNECTIONS HAPPEN BECAUSE
THE THOUGHTS ARE GOING FAST
AND IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
IN A WAY THAT IN MENTALLY
HEALTHY AVERAGE PEOPLE DON'T
HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE CURRENT CROP OF
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
RUNNING--
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH OF THEM DO YOU THINK
SEEMS THE MOST CREATIVE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I HAVE TO SAY, YOU ASKED
JUST THE RIGHT QUESTION
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE
SHOULD BE ASKING ABOUT OUR
CLEAT LEADERS.
WHO ARE CREATIVE, RESILIENT,
EMPATHIC AND REALISTIC.
THESE ARE THE FOUR TRAITS OF
LEADERSHIP THAT GROW OUT OF
MANIA AND DEPRESSION.
AND WE WILL GET PEOPLE LIKE
THAT AND WE SHOULD ACCEPT
THEM.
>> Stephen: WHO.
>> I HAVE TO SAY I HAVEN'T
NOTICED ONE OF THEM TO HAVE
A LOT OF THOSE QUALITIES.
>> Stephen: SO THEY ARE ALL
JUST TOO NORMAL.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IS OBAMA NORMAL?
>> HE SAYS HE IS.
HE SAYS HE'S WELL ADJUSTED
TO QUOTE HIM IN AN INTERVIEW
FROM A CAMPAIGN.
AND HE WAS CERTAINLY
PACKAGED AS NO DRAMA OBAMA,
ALL CALM AND NORMAL IF
THAT'S THE CASE HE MAY NOT
BE UP TO THE CRISES WE HAVE
TODAY.
BUT MY HUNCH IS READING HIS
MEMOIR WHICH WAS WRITTEN
LONG BEFORE HE RAN FOR
PRESIDENT, THAT HE MAY BE
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
AND THAT MAY BE A GOOD
THING.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT,
ONE WAY TO GET A BETTER
LEADER ONCE THEY ARE IN
OFFICE IS TO-- IS TO GAS
LIGHT THEM AND MAKE THEIR
CRAZY, WHICH MIGHT BE WHAT
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN
DOING ALL ALONG, JUST TO
HELP OBAMA.
I MEAN THE TEA PARTY COULD
BE THERAPY FOR HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, YOU'RE BORN WITH
THIS, GENERALLY.
IT'S GENETIC.
>> Stephen: IT GENETIC.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: SO PERHAPS WE
SHOULD TAKE LIKE CHEEK
SCRAPINGS OF OUR LEADERS TO
FIND OUT IF THERE IS A MILD
PROPENSITY--
OR PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE A
RESERVE PRESIDENT WHO IS
PERHAPS NOT QUITE AS
BALANCED AS THE MAIN
PRESIDENT, AND WE UNLEASH
HIM WHEN THING GOES BAD.
>> THAT WOULD BE ONE IDEA.
BUT I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO
DO IT IS JUST LUKE WE HAVE
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
RELEASE THEIR MEDICAL
RECORDS AND IN A MATTER OF
FACT WAY WE ASSESS THAT,
MAYBE WE SHOULD LEARN ABOUT
THEIR PSYCHIATRIC BACKGROUND
IN A MATTER OF FACT WAY,
EXCEPT THAT SOME ABNORMALITY
IS QUITE GOOD.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT
REAGAN?
HE HANDLED THE UNITED STATES
BEAUTIFULLY IN A TIME OF
CRISIS GOING UP AGAINST THE
SOVIET UNION, OBVIOUSLY THE
INVASION OF GRENADA, AND HE
WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL.
HIS IDEA OF, YOU KNOW, BEING
WILD WAS TO PUT TWO
DIFFERENT FLAVORED JELLY
BEANS IN HIS MOUTH AT THE
SAME TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: DO YOU SEE
ANYTHING IN REAGAN,
WAS THERE ANYTHING IN HIS
PAST THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE
KIND OF CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY
THAT A MENTAL ILLNESS MIGHT
BRING?
>> I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU
THAT REAGAN WAS PERFECTLY
NORMAL.
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD AGREE
WITH YOU ABOUT HIS GREAT
LEADERSHIP.
I THINK WE HAVE HAD-- .
>> Stephen: YOU HE
PERSONALLY KICKED DOWN THE
BERLIN WALL, SIR.
>> DID HE?
(LAUGHTER)
IN THE LIST OF NORMAL
AVERAGE LEADERS WHO WE'VE HAVE
HAD WHO MANY PEOPLE WOULD
SAY HAVE TO THE BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL, THE ONES THAT I
THINK THERE WOULD BE LITTLE
DEBATE ABOUT WOULD BE PEOPLE
LIKE GENERAL GEORGE
McCLELLAN AND NEVILLE
CHAMBERLAIN IN WORLD WAR II
AND MAYBE IN RECENT TIMES A
LOT OF OUR RECENT PRESIDENTS
INCLUDING REAGAN, AND OTHERS
WHO HAVE MAYBE SOME
SUCCESSES.
BUT MORE RECENTLY MAYBE
GEORGE W. BUSH HERE, MAYBE
TONY BLAIR IN ENGLAND,-- .
>> Stephen: BUSH WAS NORMAL
WATCH.
ABOUT CHENEY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS FINGER
ON THE BUTTON, SO I DON'T
KNOW IF HE COUNTS.
>> Stephen: HE HAD HIS
FINGER ON THE FINGER ON THE
BUTTON.
>> GOOD POINT, GOOD POINT.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
THE BOOK IS A FIRST RATE
MADNESS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
