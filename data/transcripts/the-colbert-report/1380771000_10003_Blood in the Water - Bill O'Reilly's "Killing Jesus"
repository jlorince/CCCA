>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW I AM A HUGE FANOF PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY.
BILL IS MY MENT OR, HE OR,INSPIRATION.
MY SAFEWORD.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T BECOME ALEGEND WITHOUT MAKE SOMETHING
ENEMIES, AND I'M AFRAID THE KINGIS ONCE AGAIN UNDER ATTACK.
THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
>> SHARK, SHARK.
SHARK-SHARK-SHARK.
SHARK.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS.
LAST SUNDAY NIGHT, LAST SUNDAYBILL WAS ON "60 MINUTES" TO
DISCUSS HIS NEW BOOK "KILLINGJESUS."
SORRY, CHRISTIANS.
SPOILER ALERT.
IT IS THE LATEST IN HIS KILLINGSERIES FOLLOWING "KILLING
KENNEDY," "KILLING LINCOLN," ANDHIS CHILDREN'S BOOK, "KILLING
CLIFFORD."
TURNS OUT THE BIG RED PUPPY HADA CASE OF GIGANTIC RABIES AND
HAD TO BE PUT DOWN.
SAD, BUT TRUE.
NOW, BILL WASTED NO TIMEANSWERING THE QUESTION THAT WAS
ON EVERYBODY'S MIND-- WHY DIDYOU WRITE THIS BOOK?
>> HOW DID THE IDEA COME TO YOU?
>> ALL OF THE IDEAS COME TO MEIN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
AND ONE NIGHT, I JUST WOKE UPAND WENT "KILLING JESUS."
AND I BELIEVE, BECAUSE I'M ACATHOLIC, THAT COMES FROM THE
HOLY SPIRIT.
>> YOU BELIEVE THE HOLY SPIRITDIRECTED YOU TO WRITE "KILLING
JESUS"?
>> YES, I BELIEVE THAT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  YES.
YES.
( APPLAUSE )AS A CATHOLIC, BILL BELIEVES IN
THE TRINITY.
THIS CASE, THE FATHER, THE SON,AND THE HOLY GHOST WRITER.
( LAUGHTER )BILL KNOWS HE IS SIMPLY GOD'S
HUMBLE SERVANT.
>> AND WHY WOULD THE HOLY SPIRITCHOOSE YOU?
>> YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SPECULATEABOUT THEIDATEY.
>> WELL, YOU ARE SUGGESTING YOUARE THE CHOSEN ONE.
>> I'M NOT THE CHOSEN ONE.
I'M JUST ONE OF MANY WHO HAVEBEEN GIVEN GIFTS.
>> Stephen:  VERY IMPORTANT.
BILL IS NOT SAYING HE'S THECHOSEN ONE.
HE'S JUST AVERAGE JOE, PROPHETOF GOD.
YOUR JEREMIAH, YOUR ZACH RYE,YOUR BILLOREIYAH.
HE SIMPLY SAYS-- THAT'S ALL HE'SSAYING.
GOD CHOSE HIM.
HE SIMPLY SPEAKS FOR THEALMIGHTY.
WHO COULD FORGET WHEN YAHWEHSPAKETH TO THE ISRAELITES.
>> WHAT WORDS CAN I SPEAK THATWILL HEED ( BLEEP ).
>> WE'LL DO IT LIVE!
( BLEEP ).
SUCK!
>> Stephen:  THIS IS THE WORDOF THE LORD.
OF COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIAIMMEDIATELY ATTACKED O'REILLY
FROM ALL SIDES WITH HUNDREDS OFONE ARTICLE BY SOME GUY IN FILL
NAMED HOWARD.
AND, BOY, DID ST. BILLY BURN HISBUSH.
>> MOCKERY IN THE SECULAR PRESSBEGAN--
>> WRITING IN THE "PHILADELPHIADAILY NEWS" HOWARD GENSLERS
WROTE, "BILL O'REILLY HAZE GODTOLD HIM TO WRITE HIS NEW BOOK
"KILLING GEEZ US, A HISTORY."
HE SAYS IT'S ALL PART OF GOD'SPLAN TO HIM.
DID GOD ALSO GIVE YOU THE IDEAFOR PIN HEADS AND PATRIOTS?
FOR SURE, HOWARD.
SO I CAN DESIGNATE YOU AS A PINHEAD.
BUT THIS GOES WAY BEYOND THAT,DOESN'T, IT, HOWARD PUP ARE
MOCK,ING MY CHRISTIAN FAITH.
>> Stephen:  YOU ARE MOCKINGHIS CHRISTIAN FACE.
THIS IS FILLED WITH THE RULE OFCHRISTIANITY.
RULE NUMBER ONE, NO FORGIVENESS( BLEEP )!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )JESUS HIMSELF SAID YOU CROSS ME,
A CUT A... THE SUREST EVIDENCEGOD TOLD BILL O'REILLY TO WRITE
A BOOK ABOUTIOD GOD, ACCORDINGTO BILL O'REILLY, IT'S MORE
ACCURATE THAN GOLD'S BOOK ABOUTGOD.
>> YOU INCLUDE TWO QUOTE FROMJESUS ON THE CROSS, BUT NOT THE
MOST FAMOUS ONE, "FATHER FORGIVETHEM.
FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO."
WHY NOT?
>> WE DON'T PUT IN THINGS THATWE DON'T THINK HAPPENED.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?
>> BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T SAYSOMETHING LIKE THAT AUDIBLY THAT
PEOPLE WOULD HEAR.
HE--( LAUGHTER )
HE DIED ON THE CROSS BEINGSUFFOCATED.
YOUR LUNGS CAN'T TAKE IN ANYMORE AIR.
YOU CAN HARDLY BREATHE.
WE BELIEVE JESUS SAID THAT BUTWE DON'T BELIEVE HE SAID IT ON
THE CROSS BECAUSE NOBODY COULDHAVE HEARD IT.
>> Stephen:  YET, WALKING ONWATER, RISING FROM THE DEAD,
JESUS CAN HANDLE IT.
( LAUGHTER )BUT TALKING LOUD ENOUGH TO BE
HEARD?
NOW YOU'RE ON BILL'S TURF.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
AND, FOLKS, INFORMATION I GOTTATELL YOU BILL'S NOT THE ONLY
PUNDIT WHO TALKS TO THE LORD.
EVERY ONE OF MY BOOKS HAS BEENDWIENL INSPIRED.
FOR INSTANCE, BEFORE I WROTE MYTHIRD BOOK GOD CAME TO ME IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HE SAID,"HEY, STEVE, IF YOU WRITE
ANOTHER BOOK, YOU COULD PROBABLYAFFORD NEW DECKING ON YOUR
SAILBOATS, AND, LO IT HAS COMETOPAZ.
FOLKS, I WANT TO TELL YOU I AMVERY CAREFUL WITH THIS POWER.
I ALSO MAKE SURE THE VOICE IN MYSHOULD GOD'S.
AFTER ALL, MY NEIGHBOR'S DOGALSO TALKS TO ME IN MY SLEEP AND
TELLS ME TO KILL PEOPLE BUT IIGNORE HIM BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOD.
ALTHOUGH, ROSCO IS AN ORDAINEDMINISTER.
( LAUGHTER )I ALSO BELIEVE-- AND THIS IS
JUST ME-- THAT-- ♪  ♪
HOLD ON, I'M GETTING SOMETHINGFROM GOD RIGHT NOW.
WHAT'S THAT?
UH-HUH?
UH-HUH?
SHE SAID WHAT!
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?
O-M-YOU.
DID YOU NOT GO THERE!
ARE YOU GRADE-ACRAZAZZY MY MAN.
LONG STORY, JOAN OF ARC IS ADRAMA QUEEN.
ANYWAY, I HATE TO BURST YOURBUBBLE, BILL, BUT GOD TALKS TO
ME BEFORE HE TALKS TO YOU.
IN FACT, GOD PITCHED ME ON THISWHOLE "KILLING JESUS" THING, AND
WHEN I PASSED ON THE PROJECT--SEEM DERIVATIVE-- HE ASKED ME TO
TELL YOU.
SO IN FACT IT WAS ME WHISPERINGINTO YOUR EAR IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT.
I MEAN--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?
BILL, WRITE A BOOK ABOUT JESUSTHAT'S MORE ACCURATE THAN THE
BIBLE.
ALSO, DON'T TELL PEOPLE ABOUTTHE VOICES YOU HEAR IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSETHEY'LL THINK YOU'RE A CRAZY
NARCISSIST.
( LAUGHTER )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
