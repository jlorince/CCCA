>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN
A BOOK ABOUT WHERE OUR
BELIEFS COME FROM.
THE BELIEF FAIRY.
PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL
SHERMER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
>> GREAT TO BE BACK.
>> YOU ARE THE FOUNDING
PUBLISHER OF SKEPTIC
MAGAZINE.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED
THE BELIEFING BRAIN, FROM
GOESS AND GODS IT TO
POLITICS AND CONSPIRACYS,
HOW WE CONSTRUCT BELIEFS AND
REINFORCE THEM AS TRUTHS.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT OUR BRAINS
THAT MAKES US GIVE SUCH LONG
TITLES TO THEM?
(LAUGHTER)
BELIEVING BRAIN, WHAT DOW
MEAN BELIEVING BRAIN.
>> WELL, THE RULE ON THAT IS
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU WHAT
THE BOOK IS ABOUT.
WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS HOW OUR
BRIEFS ARE FORMED FIRST, FOR
A VARIETY OF SOCIAL,
PSYCHOLOGICAL, PERSONAL,
EMOTIONAL, SUBJECTIVE
REASONS AND THEN WE FIND THE
EVIDENCE TO FIT IT.
OUR BRAINS ARE LIKE LAWYERS,
NOT SCIENTISTS.
OUR BRAINS WANT TO LAWYER
THE DATA TO FIT OUR BELIEFS.
ISN'T IT NICE --
>> ARE OUR BRAINS CHARGING
US BY THE HOUR.
>> YES, THEY ARE
EXPENSIVEMENT ISN'T IT NICE
WE CAN USE THAT WORD AS A
KNOWN AND VERDICT.
WE MARSHAL THE FACTS TO FIT
OUR BELIEFS THAT WE ALREADY
HOLD.
IF ARE YOU A CONSERVATIVE
YOU READ "THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL," YOU LISTEN
CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO AND
FILTER EVERYTHING, AND ONLY
FIND AND REMEMBER THE THINGS
THAT SUPPORT WHAT YOU
ALREADY BELIEVE.
IF ARE YOU A LIBERAL YOU
READ "THE NEW YORK TIMES",
LISTEN TO PROGRESSIVE TALK
RADIO CASH DID -- I GUESS
NOBODY DOES, YOU LISTEN NPR
AND YOU FIND ALL THE FACTS
THAT FIT THAT AND EVERYBODY
HAS THE DATA.
SO WHO IS RIGHT.
AND SO THE ONLY WAY TO TELL
REALLY THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE TRUE PATTERNS
AND FALSE PATTERNS IS
SCIENCE.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> REALLY.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK
SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER.
>> YEAH, I'M NOT JOKE BEING
THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT JOCK
BEING SCIENCE BUT ISN'T THAT
JUST YOUR BELIEF?
ARE YOU A SKEPTIC, YOU ARE
INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT
SKEPTICISM, THE SCIENTIFIC
METHOD IS THE RIGHT IDEA BUT
THAT IS SO THAT YOU LOOK FOR
EVIDENCE OUT THERE IN THE
WORLD THAT EVIDENCE IS A
GOOD THING TO LOOK FOR AND
YOU -- IT IS THE PERIODIC
TABLE ELEMENT.
>> SO I CAN -- BUT ISN'T
SCIENCE IS JUST ANOTHER
BELIEF SYSTEM.
>> IT IS ANOTHER BELIEF
SYSTEM BUT IT SETS APART
FROM ALL THE OTHER BELIEF
SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT HAS BUILT
INTO IT SELF-CORRECTING
MACHINERY THAT SAYS IF YOU
DON'T LOOK FOR YOUR
DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE THAT
DEBUNKS YOUR OWN BELIEF,
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL, USUALLY
WITH GREAT PLEA IN A
PUBLISHED FORM.
>> WHAT IS DEBUNKING, WHAT
IS SO GOOD ABOUT DEBUNKING.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH BUDGETING.
WHY MUST THINGS BE DEBUNKED.
>> BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF
BUDGET.
THERE IS A LOT OF NONSENSE,
BAD SCIENCE, VOODOO SCIENCE,
PATHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,
NONSCIENCE AND PLANE OLD
NONSENSE T IS ALL OVER THE
PLACE.
MOST OF THE STUFF WE HEAR IS
IN THE TRUE.
UNFORTUNATELY OUR BRAINS
EVOLVE TO ASSUME THAT MOST
OF THE PATTERNS WE SEE ARE
TRUE.
WHATEVER WE SEE AND HEAR
ESPECIALLY ON TELEVISION F
IT'S VISUAL, EMOTIONALLY
SALIENT WE HOOK ON IT AND
SAY MUST BE TRUE, I HEARD
IT.
>> IF IT RHYMES, IT IS
PROBABLY TRUE.
IS THAT THE PATTERN WE
PERCEIVE THAT PATTERN.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: IF THE GLOVE
DOES NOT FIT, YOU MUST
ACQUIT.
THAT IS HOW WE KNEW THAT
JUICE WAS INNOCENT.
>> YES SO HERE'S HOW THIS --
HERE IS HOW THIS WORKS.
SO IMAGINE YOU ARE A HOMIDID
ON THE PLAINS OF AFRICA AND
YOU HEAR A RUSSELL IN THE
GRASS.
IS IT A DANGEROUS PREDATOR
OR JUST THE WIND.
>> Stephen: IT'S A SNAKE,
KILL IT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU ASSUME
IT IS JUST THE WIND, YOU ARE
LUNCH.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> ARE YOU LIKELY, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT THE
WIND T IS A SNAKE OR A
TIGER.
>> MOST OF THE PATTERNS WE
FIND -- IT IS VERY
DANGEROUS.
AND THAT IS WHERE WE VOLUME
OF THE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S GOOD THEN
SO IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE
BELIEFS AND IF WE JUST HAVE
SKEPTICISM WE GO LET'S GO
OVERCOME CHILDREN, LET'S SEE
WHAT THAT RUSSELLING SOUND
IS, WE WOULD ALL BE DEAD.
YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL COURT
CHILDREN.
WHY SHOULD -- WHAT ABOUT
RELIGION.
WE ALSO HAVE RECEIVED --
TRUTHS FROM GOD THAT CAN BE
CORRECTED BY GOD'S PROPHETS.
>> THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY
PROPHETS AND THEY CONFLICT
WITH EACH OTHER.
>> Stephen: THE --
>> WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT
COULD WE RUN TO TELL THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER
THIS IS THE ONE TRUE
RELIGION OR THIS IS.
THE ANSWER IS NONE, THERE IS
NONE.
>> Stephen: THERE IS ONE DAY
OF EXPERIMENT --
EXPERIMENTATION, JUDGEMENT
DAY.
>> WE'LL FIND OUT.
>> Stephen: I WILL BE READY
WITH MY LAB COAT ON.
>> I HAVE A WHOLE SECTION TO
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO GOD IF
IT TURNS OUT I'M WRONG AND
THERE IS A GOD.
>> Stephen: FIRST OF ALL,
HAND ME MY ASBESTOS COAT.
>> WELL?
YOU ARE ARGUING FROM THE
SIDE --.
>> Stephen: YOU USED TO BE A
CHRISTIAN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: JESUS MISSES
YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: HE --.
>> Stephen: HE TOLD ME.
>> WHY DOESN'T HE TALK TO
ME.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU
DON'T BELIEVE.
>> BUT IF BEING TALKED TO
DEPENDS ON WHETHER I BELIEVE
OR NOT THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T
REALLY EXIST, IT'S ALL UP
HERE IN MY HEAD WHICH IS THE
POINT IN MY BOOK WHICH IT IS
ALL UP HERE.
>> Stephen: OH, BOOK.
MICHAEL SHERMER THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
THE BOOK IS THE BELIEFING
BRAIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
