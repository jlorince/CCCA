( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY
SECRET, ANYBODY WHO WATCHES THE
NEWS KNOWS WE LIVE IN A DIVIDED
NATION BUT THERE ARE SOME EVENTS
SO TRAGIC THAT THEY BRING US
TOGETHER, REGARDLESS OF OUR
BELIEFS.
I'M SPEAKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT
THE EPIDEMIC OF PEOPLE EATING
JIMMY FALLON'S ICE CREAM LATE
NIGHT SNACK.
JIMMY'S... FOOD IS AN UNHOLY
SLURRY OF VANILLA AND
FUDGE-COVERED POTATO CHIP
CLUSTERS I ASSUME PAINSTAKINGLY
COMBED OUT OF JERRY'S BEARD
AFTER LUNCH.
IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF
CHILDREN FORCED TO EAT JIMMY'S
SWILL, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE
CRYING OUT FOR A TASTE OF MY BEN
& JERRY'S ICE CREAM FLAVOR,
STEPHEN COLBERT'S AMERICONE
DREAM
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
A SATISFYING BLEND OF VANILLA
ICE CREAM, CARAMEL, AND
FUNNEL-COVERED WAFFLE CONE
PIECES.
OH, YES.
THAT'S THE SOUND OF FREEDOM
GOING MMM!
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS REGULAR VIEWERS OF THE
FOLKS KNOW THAT BEGINNING LAST
MARCH, I LOVED JIMMY FALLON.
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER FOR
SIX MONTHS.
BUT THEN THOSE SIX MONTHS ENDED
IN SEPTEMBER, AND WE BECAME
ETERNAL ENEMIES FOR SIX MONTHS.
SO NOW I HATE HIM.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER EMOTIONS.
NOW, I WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY TO
HATE JIMMY IN SEETHING, MERCLESS
SILENCE, BUT LAST OCTOBER, JIMMY
RAISED THE STAKES BY SOMEHOW
GETTING BEN & JERRY'S TO COME ON
HIS SHOW AND SAY THIS --
>> THE BIG ISSUE EVERYONE IS
TALKING ABOUT IS I'M OUT-SELLING
STEPHEN COLBERT'S ICE CREAM.
>> YOU KNOW, THE FLAVOR IS DOING
VERY, VERY WELL.
THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, IT'S
OUTSELL.
>> YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  JIMMY FALLON'S
ICE CREAM WAS OUTSELLING MINE.
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
WHO WAS BUYING IT AND WHAT FOR.
DID FEAR FACTOR RUN OUT OF
DONKEY SEMEN.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
IT'S POSSIBLE.
SO ONCE AGAIN, I AM CALLING ON
YOU HEROS TO GET OUT THERE AND
KNOCK THIS USURPER OFF MY
FUDGE-COVERED THRONE.
I WANT YOU TO CRUSH HIM, TO BEAT
HIM LIKE A REDHEADED STEPCHILD.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH CONAN'S
ICE CREAM, RED VELVET STEPCHILD
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, FOLKS, I AM HAPPY TO SAY
THAT BEN AN GER REON MY SIDE.
THEY ARE RELEASING AN EXCITING
NEW PACKAGE THAT EWAITS THE
DOMINANCE OF MY ICE CREAM WITH
THE DOMINANCE OF MY SUPERPAC.
YOU CAN NOW BUY AMERICONE DREAM
IN SUPERPAC PACKS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THEY'RE GOOD.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU FOLKS FAKE AN ORGASM.
IN THIS ELECTION, COLBERT
SUPERPAC IS THROWING ITS WEIGHT
AROUND, AND THANKS TO MY ICE
CREAM, WE'LL HAVE EVEN MORE
WEIGHT TO THROW AROUND.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, THESE-- THESE NEW SUPERPAC
PACKS WILL BE RELEASED AT SOME
POINT, AND YOU WILL WANT TO
SNATCH THEM UP, FOLKS, BECAUSE
THIS IS A COLLECTIBLE.
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IT SAYS SO
RIGHT THERE, "2012 COLLECTIBLE
ELECTION YEAR PACKAGE."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
REMEMBER, THESE HEIRLOOMS ONLY
RETAIN THEIR VALUE AS LONG AS
THEY REMAIN UNOPENED.
SO BE SURE TO BUY A PINT AND PUT
IT IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX WITH
ALL YOUR MOST IMPORTANT
DOCUMENTS AND CHILDHOOD PHOTOS.
NOW I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
ALTHOUGH THE ICE CREAM CUP IS
CALLED A SUPERPAC, PROFITS FROM
AMERICONE DREAM WILL NOT GO TO
COLBERT SUPERPAC.
THEY'LL STILL GO TO CHARITIES
LIKE THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND,
DONORS CHOOSE, AND THE
LNS RECOVERY FUND PROVIDING
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE FOR
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCIDENTALLY
INGESTED JIMMY FALLON'S LATE
NIGHT SNACK.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, FOLKS, THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE
LASTS ONLY A FEW DAYS, BUT THE
EMOTIONAL SCARS LAST A LIFETIME.
AND TO CELEBRATE THIS NEW
SUPERPACKAGING ON VALENTINE'S
DAY, THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF
THE RELEASE OF AMERICONE DREAM,
PARTICIPATING BEN & JERRY'S
SCOOP SHOPS ACROSS AMERICA WILL
BE GIVING IT AWAY.
THAT'S RIGHT, FREE AMERICONE
DREAM, FEBRUARY 14, FROM 5:00
P.M. TO 8:00 P.M.
SO MAKE SURE TO HEAD ON OVER AND
GET YOURS BECAUSE ON VALENTINE'S
DAY, THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO
SAY "I HATE YOU, JIMMY FALLON."
( LAUGHTER )
I REALLY HATE YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
>> OOOH!
>> Stephen:  I MISS US.
