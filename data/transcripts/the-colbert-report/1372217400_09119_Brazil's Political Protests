NATION, I DON'T PAY ATTENTION TOSOUTH AMERICA ANY MORE THAN I
CARE ABOUT EAST AMERICA OR WESTAMERICA OR UPSIDE-DOWN AMERICA.
BUT EVEN I CANNOT HELP BUTNOTICE THAT BRAZIL IS GOING
THROUGH A MAJOR POLITICALUPHEAVAL, OR AS THEY CALL IT,
FUTBOL .
JIM?
>> NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLESPILLED INTO THE STREETS IN
MAJOR CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRYIN THE BIGGEST PROTEST BRAZIL
HAS SEEN IN DECADES.
PROTESTORS WENT HEAD TO HEADWITH RIOT POLICE AND WERE MET
WITH TEAR GAS.
>> MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLEHITTING THE STREETS IN AT LEAST
80 CITIES.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I DON'T GETIT.
THIS IS BRAZIL, THE MOST JOYFULPLACE ON EARTH.
THE ONLY THING BRAZILIANS EVERGET MAD AT IS THEIR PUBIC HAIR.
I DON'T... I HAVE NEVER HEARD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DID TO THEMBUT THEY ARE MERCILESS
DOWN THERE.
NO PRISONERS.
SO JUST WHAT IS IT THAT UPSETTHEM?
DID PELE PUT ONE OF THOSE CARMENMIRANDA HATS ON THE GIANT STATUE
OF JESUS?
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUTBRAZIL.

NATION IS TRYING TO SHOW ITSELFON THE WORLD STAGE SPENDING
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON STADIUMSAHEAD OF THE OLYMPICS AND
ORDINARY PEOPLE FEELING THEY'RENOT GETTING ENOUGH ATTENTION
FROM THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.
