>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT"!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
FOLKS -- (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, WITH AN ARMY LIKE YOU
BEHIND ME, I THINK WE CAN STORM THE MORANIN.
FOLKS, IT IS NIGHT TWO OF HOW ABOUT WEEK OR AS THEY SAY IN THE BLACK TONG OF MORDOR, TUESDAY.
(LAUGHTER) I'M JUST ENJOYING SOME OF THE PIPE WEED THAT SIR IAN McKELLAN LEFT IN HIS DRESSING ROOM.
(LAUGHTER) PRETTY GOOD.
NOT AS GOOD AS THE STUFF THAT WILLIE NELSON LEAVES BEHIND.
(LAUGHTER) STILL, WIZARDY WEED IS GOOD FOR ONE THING.
CHECK THIS OUT.
NOT BAD, EH.
SAVE THAT FOR LATER.
LAST NIGHT, GANDALF THE GRAY ASKED ME TO JOIN HIM ON THE ADVENTURE AND TONIGHT IT IS THE
LEAD CHARACTER OF BILBO GAG AGAINS.
MARTIN FREEMAN.
