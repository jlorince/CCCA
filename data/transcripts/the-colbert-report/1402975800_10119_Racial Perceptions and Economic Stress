>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
NATION, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, OURFIRST BLACK PRESIDENT'S FIRST
BLACK ECONOMY CONTINUES TO LETDOWN MY FRIENDS IN THE AFRICAN
AMERICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
[LAUGHTER]THE INCOME GAP BETWEEN BLACKS
AND WHITES CONTINUES TO GROW,AND BLACK COLLEGE GRADUATES ARE
TWICE AS LIKELY AS THEIR PEERSTO BE UNEMPLOYED.
EVEN WORSE, THEIR UNITED COLLEGEFUND STILL CALLS THEM NEGROES.
COME ON!
NOW, WHEN BARACK OBAMA WASELECTED PRESIDENT, WE WERE
PROMISED THAT RACISM WAS OVER,BUT FOR SOME REASON IT STILL
EXISTS.
I BLAME THE MEXICANS.
[LAUGHTER]JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW BAD RACISM
STILL IS, THIS MONTH'S ATLANTICMAGAZINE IS ONE OF THE
FASTEST-SELLING ISSUES IN ITSHISTORY THANKS TO MY GUEST,
TA-NEHESIA COATES, ENTITLED "THECASE FOR REPARATIONS."
REPARATIONS?
WHAT HAPPENED TO FORGIVE ANDFORGET?
WHITE PEOPLE HAVE DONE THESECOND PART.
NOW, LUCKILY, I THINK WE HAVEFOUND THE CURE TO RACISM THANKS
TO A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN THEPROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OR PNES. THESTUDY WAS ON RACIAL PERCEPTION.
SCIENTISTS CREATED A SPECTRUM OFFACES RANGING FROM WHITE TO
BLACK, ALSO KNOWN AS THOMASJEFFERSON'S FAMILY TREE.
[LAUGHTER]BEFORE VIEWING ANY FACES IN THIS
SPECTRUM, SUBJECTS WERE PRIMEDTO THINK ABOUT SCARCITY BY THE
SLIT-SECOND PROJECTION OFSUCH WORDS AS "SCARCE,"
"SPARSE" OR "LIMITED." THOSEPRIMED TO THINK ABOUT
SCARCE OR LIMITED RESOURCES WEREMUCH MORE
LIKELY TO SEE SOMEONE WITH FEWAFRICAN FACIAL FEATURES AS
BLACK. WHEN THE WHITE SUBJECTSWERE
SHOWN TWO FACIAL IMAGES AND TOLDTO DIVVY
UP $15, THEY CONSISTENTLYSHORTED THE BLACK IMAGE WITH $7
OR LESS.
TO RECAP: WHEN MONEY IS SCARCE,WHITE PEOPLE THINK EVERYONELOOKS
BLACK AND THEN WON'T GIVE THEMANY MONEY, CONFIRMING RESULTS
FIRST PUBLISHED IN PAUL RYAN'SBUDGET.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NATION, THIS STUDY PROVES WHITE
PEOPLE DON'T DISCRIMINATEBECAUSE WE'RE RACIST.
WE DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIEDABOUT ECONOMIC SCARCITY, WHICH
MEANS THERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TOERADICATE RACISM IN AMERICA:
GIVE WHITE PEOPLE MORE MONEY.
THAT'S WHY, THAT'S THE REASONCONSERVATIVES WANT TO CUT TAXES
FOR THE WEALTHY. WE'RE TRYINGHEAL A WOUNDED
NATION AND MAYBE FINALLYREACH MARTIN LUTHER KING'S
MOUNTAINTOP, WHICH IN THIS CASEIS A PILE OF MONEY.
WHEN WE COME BACK, I WILL ASK MYGUEST TA-NEHISI COATES FOR $10.
