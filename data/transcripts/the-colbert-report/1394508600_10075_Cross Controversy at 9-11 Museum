(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,STEPHEN!, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THEREPORT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US ONTHIS LOVELY MONDAY NIGHT, IN
EARLY MARCH.
FOLKS, SOME OF YOU OUT THEREMAY NOT KNOW IT YOU MAY NOT
KNOW THIS, FOLKS.
I KNOW SOME YOU KNOW THISBUT AS A PROUD CATHOLIC, I
HAVE NEVER REALLY CARED MUCHFOR ATHEISTS.
(LAUGHTER)IF YOU ARE TURNING YOUR BACK
ON GOD'S CHRISTIANTEACHINGS, THEN AT LEAST
HAVE THE COURAGE TO CALLYOURSELF A LUTHERAN.
BUT FOLKS, THE LATEST STUNTBY THESE NONBELIEVERS IS
TRULY NONBELIEVABLE.
>> A GROUP CALLED AMERICANATHEISTS IS FIGHTING TO
REMOVE A CROSS ONDISPLAY AT THE
SOON TO OPEN 9/11 MEMORIALMUSEUM SAYING THE SIGHT OF
IT CAUSES QUOTE MENTALANGUISH.
>> Stephen: YES, THIS CROSSCAUSES MENTAL ANGUISH FOR
ATHEISTS.
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE ACARE-FREE VISIT TO THE 9/11
MUSEUM.
NOW FOLKS-- (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS THISATHEIST LAWSUIT OFFENDS ME
AND NOT JUST AS A CHRISTIANBUT AS A LOVER OF GOOD
PUBLIC RELATIONS.
COME ON, ATHEISTS, YOU'REPROTESTING A CROSS IN THE
9/11 MUSEUM?
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE GODCAN HEAR YOU, BUT YOU
REALIZE THE REST OF US CAN,RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)BUT, BUT FOLKS, PRESIDENT OF
AMERICAN ATHEISTS DAVIDSILVERMAN JUST CANNOT LET
THIS ONE GO.
>> PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDINGTHE FACT THAT THE CROSS IS
CHRISTIAN, THAT IT WASINSTALLED IN A RELIGIOUS
SERVICE AND ON CONSECRATEDGROUND WHICH MAKES IT A
SHRINE ON PUBLIC LAND IN AWORLD TRADE CENTER. IT'S A
CHRISTIAN CROSS.
>> Stephen: YES, THOSE IBEAMS FOUND IN THE WRECKAGE
CAN ONLY BE A CHRISTIANCROSS, WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION COULD THERE BEFROM A BUILDING MADE OF
RIGHT ANGLES TO LEAVESOMETHING LIKE THAT BEHIND?
APPARENTLY, APPARENTLYATHEISTS WANT TO HONOR LACK
OF BELIEF AT GROUND ZERO.
THOUGH I PERSONALLY THINK THEENTIRE TRAGEDY ALREADY
SUGGESTS THAT RELIGIOUSFERVOR SOMETIMES HAS A
DOWNSIDE.
JIM?
>> THEY SAY THAT IF THISCROSS IS GOING TO STAND IF A
MUSEUM THEY WANT TO HAVE APLAQUE THAT HONORS ALL OF
THE ATHEISTS WHO DIED ON9/11 AS WELL.
>> Stephen: LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT, ATHEISTS, YOU SAY
THE ONLY RESPONSE NECESSARYFOR NONBELIEVERS IN THE FACE
OF THE NUMINOUS IS TOPOINT OUT THE AWESOME GRANDEUR
OF THE UNIVERSE,WITNESS THE SPLENDER OF
PIN-WHEELING GALAXIES,TO WONDER AT THE INTRICATE
TAPESTRY OF LIFE AND TIMEAND SAY THERE IT IS, AND HERE
WE ARE, WE NEED NO GOD,BUT A PLAQUE WOULD BE NICE?
