PREPARED FOR INVASIONS BY TONY STARK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT MOVING TO THE CITADEL BECAUSE MAKE NO
MISTAKE-- THEY'RE COMING FOR OUR GUNS.
AND WE FREEDOM-LOVING GUN-LOVERS ARE TOTALLY DEFENSELESS!
OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW, THE GUNS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT NOW, GUN CONTROL TALK IS SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE FOR REASONS I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO BECAUSE
IT UNDERMINES MY POSITION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND AS A RESULT, OUR DEAR LEADER OBAMA IS MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS
IN THAT HE HAS NEVER TRIED TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT LAST WEEK, HE APPOINTED REICH MARSHAL BIDEN TO HEAD UP A GUN SAFETY TASK FORCE THAT WILL
CONVENE A "SERIES OF MEETINGS" AND "OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS--" "IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD CONSENT
FOR ACTION." MEETINGS?
RECOMMENDATIONS?
EFFORT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, THAT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO JACKBOOTED POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THERE ARE RATIONAL VOICES OUT THERE, WHO HAVE A REASONED RESPONSE TO
THOSE WHO WANT GUN REGULATION.
>> NOW GET A GUN AND GO AFTER HER HIDE!
WELL SAID.
AND SAM'S NOT ALONE.
STANDING WITH HIM IS NRA HEAD WAYNE LAPIERRE, WHO IN THE WAKE OF UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY, PUT
FORTH A SIMPLE PLAN TO REASSURE OUR TROUBLED NATION.
>> I CALL ON CONGRESS TODAY TO ACT IMMEDIATELY TO APPROPRIATE WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO HAVE
PUT ARMED POLICE OFFICERS IN EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL IN THIS NATION.
>> Stephen: YES, JUST PUT ARMED OFFICERS IN EVERY SCHOOL.
THEY CAN WORK IT INTO THE PROM THEME: ENCHANTMENT UNDER THE SIEGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOLKS--
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PATRIOTS LIKE ARIZONA SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO ARE ALREADY IMPLEMENTING LAPIERRE'S VISION.
>> A CONTROVERSIAL ARIZONA SHERIFF HAS A PLAN FOR STOPPING GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS.
HE WANTS AN ARMED POSSE OF VOLUNTEERS TO STAND GUARD.
>> I HAVE DECIDED TO NOW SEND A POSSE OUT, THE ARMED POSSE TO THE SCHOOLS.
>> Stephen: THANK GOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE NOTHING REASSURES PARENTS MORE THAN SURROUNDING THEIR KIDS WITH THE KIND OF GUYS
WITH A LOT OF WEAPONS AND NOTHING TO DO ON WEEKDAYS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THESE ARE THE KIND OF REASONABLE SOLUTIONS WE NEED INSTEAD OF BLAMING THE REAL VICTIMS: GUNS.
YOU SEE, FORMER NRA PRESIDENT MARION HAMMER KNOWS THAT OUTLAWING ASSAULT WEAPONS IS
REALLY JUST ANOTHER FORM OF DISCRIMINATION.
>> BANNING PEOPLE AND THINGS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY LOOK WENT OUT A LONG TIME AGO, BUT
HERE THEY ARE AGAIN.
THE COLOR OF A GUN, THE WAY IT LOOKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: SO SAD, BANNING A GUN BASED ON IT'S COLOR.
I'M SURE IF DR. KING WERE ALIVE, HE'D BE STANDING WITH THE NRA BECAUSE IT'S JUST A LITTLE TOO
CONVENIENT TO BE BLAMING GUNS FOR GUN VIOLENCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE NRA HAS IDENTIFIED THE REAL CULPRITS.
>> VICIOUS, VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES, BLOOD-SOAKED SLASHER FILMS, OUR NATION'S REFUSAL TO CREATE
AN ACTIVE NATIONAL DATABASE OF THE MENTALLY ILL.
>> Stephen: CLEARLY, THE REASON WE HAVE MORE GUN DEATHS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE
INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD ISN'T THE GUNS.
IT MUST BE THAT AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT HAS VIDEO GAMES.
WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS VIOLENT MOVIES AND WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH CRAZY PEOPLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAYBE NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY, BUT CERTAINLY WE'VE GOT THE CRAZIEST PEOPLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO  TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
>> IF IT'S CRAZY TO CALL FOR PUTTING POLICE IN AND SECURING OUR SCHOOL TO PROTECDT OUR
CHILDREN, THEN CALL ME CRAZY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Steph
