>> Stephen: WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOO!
COME ON!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") FOLKS-- (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, NO MATTER-- SOMETIMES I THINK THE WORLD IS A DARK CAVE,
BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS MY LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
(LAUGHTER) WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NATION, I HAVE ALWAYS HATED CHANGE.
THAT'S WHY I'M SOLIDLY AGAINST TRANSFORMERS, SHRINKY-DINKS AND AIR CATERPILLARS.
(LAUGHTER) AND DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE A BUTTERFLY TRAPPED IN A LAVA'S BODY, IT'S UNNATURAL.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I WAS TRULY UPSET WHEN I HEARD MY FAVORITE NEWSPAPER, THE "U.S.A. TODAY" WAS GETTING A
DRAMATIC REDESIGN.
TURNS OUT I WAS WORRYING FOR NOTHING BECAUSE, IN A DIGITAL ERA WHERE PRINT MEDIA IS STRUGGLING, "U.S.A. TODAY" IS
FOCUSING THEIR ENERGY WHERE IT COUNTS: THE LOGO.
(LAUGHTER) AS PUBLISHER LARRY CRAMER WROTE IN THE RELAUNCH ISSUE "OUR NEW LOGO WILL BE AS DYNAMIC AS THE
NEWS ITSELF." AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DID THEY DELIVER.
PREPARE TO FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE "U.S.A. TODAY'S" NEW LOGO!
BOOM!
A BLUE CIRCLE!
(LAUGHTER) THERE IT IS!
SERENDIPITOUSLY THIS ISES A A PIE CHART SHOWING THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE CONFUSED BY THE "U.S.A. TODAY'S" NEW LOGO.
(APPLAUSE) KRAMER CALLS THIS A LIVING LOGO.
(LAUGHTER) THE FIRST ONE SINCE THEY HAD TO PUT DOWN THE M.G.M. LION AFTER HE ATE THOSE MUNCHKINS.
(LAUGHTER) AND IN A THE "U.S.A. TODAY" EXCLUSIVE, I LEARNED THAT THE "U.S.A. TODAY'S" NEW LOGO WILL
BE AN INFO GRAPHIC THAT CHANGES WITH THE NEWS, CONTAINING A PHOTO OR IMAGE THAT REPRESENTS KEY STORIES OF THE DAY.
LIKE THIS ONE IN THE MONEY SECTION, THE SHOPPING CART.
RIGHT THERE, OKAY?
(LAUGHTER) IN THE LIFE SECTION, THIS KIND OF ROUND LEAF RIGHT THERE AND FOR SPORTS, THIS RED DOT WEARING
A COWBOY HAT WHICH I'M GONNA SAY REPRESENTS THE SPORT OF TOMATO RODEO.
(LAUGHTER) I THINK.
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT FROM NOW ON, WHEN NEWS BREAKS THAT'S CIRCULAR IN NATURE THE "U.S.A. TODAY" WILL BE ALL OVER IT, FOLKS.
WHETHER IT BE ABOUT PLANETS, TRACTOR TIRES, THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE, PIZZAS, BAGELS, PIZZA BAGELS OR CEE-LO GREEN'S HEAD.
(LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH-- (APPLAUSE).
ALTHOUGH IF SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS EVER CHOKES ON A DORITO AT THE PENTAGON-- (LAUGHTER).
-- YOU WON'T READ ABOUT IT IN THE "U.S.A. TODAY." (LAUGHTER) SO BRAVO, THE "U.S.A. TODAY" FOR YOUR BOLD REDESIGN WHERE EVERY
LOGO IN EVERY SECTION WILL BE CHANGED EVERYDAY TO REFLECT A DIFFERENT NEWS STORY IN CIRCULAR FORM.
(LAUGHTER) UNTIL NEXT WEEK WHEN WE SEE THE HEADLINE ""U.S.A. TODAY" GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT COMMITS SUICIDE."
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
