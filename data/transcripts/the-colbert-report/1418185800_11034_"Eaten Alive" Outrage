FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I REALLYNEED -- THANK YOU FOR THAT
ENERGY BECAUSE I NEED ITBECAUSE, FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YA,
I COME TO YOU TONIGHT A SHAKENMAN.
BECAUSE RECENT REVELATIONS HAVEPROVEN THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WERE SYSTEMATICALLY ANDREPEATEDLY LIED TO.
FOR MORE, LET'S GO TO MYCOLLEAGUE BRETT BAIER.
>> LAST NIGHT WAS THE BIG NIGHT,THE AIRING OF THE DISCOVERY
CHANNEL'S EATEN ALIVE, WHERE AMAN OFFERED HIMSELF UP TO BE
CONSUMED BY AN ANACONDA.
MANY VIEWERS FOUND THE PAYOFFTOUGH TO SWALLOW.
>> TURNS OUT THE SNAKE SORT OFPUT HIS MOUTH AROUND HIS HEAD
AND THE GUY TAPPED OUT AND SAIDPULL ME OUT, PULL ME OUT,
AND THAT WAS IT.
>> 70 MINUTES INTO THE SHOW,ROSOLIE TAPPED OUT SAYING THE
SNAKE WAS ABOUT TO BREAK HISARM.
SO IN THE END, ROSOLIE WAS NOTEATEN ALIVE, NOT EVEN A SCRATCH.
>> Stephen: FOR SHAME,DISCOVERY CHANNEL!
YOU PROMISED US PAUL ROSOLIE WOULD BE EATEN!
HENCE THE TITLE "EATEN ALIVE ."
BUT YOU ONLY GAVE US "CUDDLEDALIVE"!
AND I'M SORRY, THAT'S JUST SNAKEFIRST BASE.
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'SANGRY, FOLKS
TWITTER TWEETED, "NEXT TIME IWATCH SOMETHING CALLED
#EATENALIVE, SOMEBODY BETTER GETEATEN ALIVE."
AND "THIS GUY HAD ONE JOB.
LITERALLY ONE (BLEEP) JOB TO GETEATEN ALIVE AND HE (BLEEP) IT
UP."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT'S OUTRAGEOUS! BUT I GOTTA SAY
AS ANGRY AS I AM, DISCOVERYDID HAVE A COGENT RESPONSE.
"PAUL CREATED THIS CHALLENGE TOGET MAXIMUM ATTENTION FOR ONE OF
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ANDTHREATENED PARTS OF THE WORLD,
THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST."
TRUE.
THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO BRINGATTENTION TO THE AMAZON RAIN
FOREST THAN TO COVER YOURSELF INPIG'S BLOOD AND CLIMB INTO A
SNAKE'S MOUTH. YOU SEE THAT
AND YOU THINK, "MAN, WE GOTTASAVE THOSE TREES."
JUST LIKE THE BEST WAY TO SAVEOUR OCEANS IS TO PUT ON SOME
FLIPPERS AND BONE A NARWHALE.I GOTTA TELL YA,
NOT EASY IN SUCH COLD WATER.(LAUGHTER)
