LET'S DO THIS FOR THE KIDS.
BUT THERE'S AN ISSUE IN THIS
ELECTION EVEN BIGGER THAN DONALD
TRUMP.
IT'S LIBYA.
YOU SEE, ON SEPTEMBER 11, THE
AMERICAN CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI
WAS ATTACKED.
FOUR AMERICANS INCLUDING OUR
AMBASSADOR WERE KILLED.
FOLLOWING THIS TRAGEDY PRESIDENT
OBAMA ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION
AND PROMISED TO BRING THOSE
RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE.
BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION WAS WITHOLDING
INFORMATION TO AVOID BEING
BLAMED FOR A TERRORIST ATTACK ON
THEIR WATCH RIGHT BEFORE THE
ELECTION.
THIS HAS LEFT SOME TROUBLING
QUESTIONS.
QUESTIONS THAT FOX NEWS HAS NOT
BEEN AFRAID TO ASK 24 HOURS A
DAY FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS.
>> WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS?
>> WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE
INTELLIGENCE?
>> WHAT WENT WRONG, WHY WAS THE
INTELLIGENCE NOT RECOGNIZED AND
ACTED UPON?
>> SPECIAL REPORT.
WHO DID THIS AND HOW?
SHOULD OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE SEEN
IT COME SOMETHING IN DID
PRESIDENT OBAMA TRY TO HIDE THE
TRUTH?
IS THIS A HUGE SCANDAL THAT
EXPOSES A FAILED OBAMA FOREIGN
POLICY?
OR IS MITT ROMNEY JUST SAYING IT
IS?
>> STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T OUR
CONSULATE HAVE MORE SECURITY?
WHY WAS THE INTELLIGENCE SO SLOW
TO COME OUT?
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU PUT
A STATEMENT IN THE FORM OF A
QUESTION, IS IT JOURNALISM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION
IMPLY THESE ATTACKS WERE INCITED
BY A YOUTUBE VIDEO THAT INSULTS
THE PROPHET MOHAMMED?
WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO CHIME
IN?
>> WHY, WHY WOULD HE -- HE AND
HIS ADMINISTRATION -- SPEAK
REPEATEDLY ABOUT THAT LITTLE
VIDEO AND WITH SUCH AUTHORITY
AND CERTAINTY?
>> WHY WOULD THEY COME UP WITH
THE VIDEO?
>> ARE WE REALLY GOING TO BLAME
A VIDEO?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: HOW COULD A VIDEO
POSSIBLY INCITE VIOLENCE?
JIMMY, WHY DON'T WE WATCH IT?
♪ ♪
>> STEPHEN: WHY HAS MY NETWORK
FORBIDDEN ME TO SHOW THAT VIDEO?
DID OBAMA GET TO THEM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR IS THERE SOME OTHER QUESTION
I SHOULD BE ASKING?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> DID THE PRESIDENT, DID HIS
TEAM, CALL THIS AN ACT OF TERROR
FROM THE START?
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE SUCH
TROUBLE SAYING THAT?
>> DOES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
HAVE A PROBLEM CALLLING IT
TERROR?
>>
>> STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL
IT TERROR RIGHT AWAY?
AND DON'T YOU MISS THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, WHEN WE KNEW
EXACTLY HOW AFRAID TO BE THANKS
TO A COLOR-CODED SCALE THAT
CHANGED BASED ON THREATS THEY
OFTEN WOULDN'T EXPLAIN?
HEY, WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?
DON'T YOU FEEL SAFER NOW THAT
I'VE TOLD YOU THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF?
OR ARE WE NOT SCARED ENOUGH OF
TERROR BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA
MIGHT NOT BE TELLING US ENOUGH
TO BE TERRIFIED ABOUT?
DID I HAVE TIME TO WASH MY HANDS
JUST NOW?
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT, DID IT?
SPEAKING OF FILTH, ARE THERE
MORE HEINOUS ASSERTIONS WE COULD
BE PULLING OUT OF OUR ASS?
>> HERE'S THE OTHER QUESTION.
AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER
QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK --
DID WE TRADE OFF-- AND I HAVE NO
EVIDENCE OF THIS-- DID WE TRADE
OFF THE LIFE OF OUR AMBASSADOR
AND THREE OTHER AMERICANS FOR
THAT CROWD?
-- WERE THESE PEOPLE EXPENDABLE
AS PART OF A MIDEAST FOREIGN
POLICY?
>> STEPHEN: WHILE WE'RE THROWING
AROUND ACCUSATIONS WITH NO
EVIDENCE, WHAT WAS PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S ROLE IN 9/11?
WHAT WAS HIS ROLE IN LANCE
ARMSTRONG'S DOPING SCANDAL?
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN MORE TROUBLING, WHY DOES
PETER JOHNSON, JR., HAVE A NAME
THAT'S THREE EUPHEMISMS FOR
PENIS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND COULD THIS JUST BE A
COMPLICATED AND TRAGIC SITUATION
THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
WANTS TO PUT THE BEST POSSIBLE
FACE ON FOR POLITICAL REASONS,
AND THAT THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN
WANTS TO PUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
FACE ON FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL
REASONS?
AND IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH
THAT?
AND IS THERE ANYTHING MORE TO
SAY ABOUT THIS STORY, OR ARE WE
ON A METAPHORICAL TREADMILL?
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND IS THAT BAD FOR OUR
METAPHORICAL KNEES?
SHOULD WE BE USING A
METAPHORICAL ELLIPTICAL?
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT ULTIMATELY, THE QUESTION IS,
HOW MANY QUESTIONS DO WE HAVE TO
ASK BEFORE VOTERS FORGET
PRESIDENT OBAMA KILLED BIN
LADEN?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
