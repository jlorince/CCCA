THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS STORY
IS FOR DAYS WE'VE BEEN OBSESSED
WITH INTERNATIONAL NEWS.
IT'S JUST BEEN BIN LADEN, BIN
LADEN, THIS STUPID HAT, BIN
LADEN.
WE'VE IGNORED IMPORTANT STORIES
AT HOME.
FOR INSTANCE,, THE AMERICAN
HEARTLAND HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY
WEATHER.
MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA WERE
SLAMMED BY HUGE TORNADOES,
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE,
HUNDREDS OF LIVES LOST.
OUR HEART, OF COURSE, GOES OUT
TO EVERYONE AFFECTED.
I URGE ALL MY VIEWERS TO TEXT
RED CROSS TO 90999 TO DONATE $10
INSTANTLY OR GO TO REDCROSS.ORG
AND GIVE GENEROUSLY.
THEY NEED IT.
THE HEARTLAND IS NOT OUT OF THE
WOODS.
STORMS HAVE SWOLLEN THE
MISSISSIPPI WHICH IS ALREADY
SWOAL WITHIN S'S, I'S AND P'S.
THE LEVEES ARE FULL AND READY TO
BURST.
WATER HAS BEEN SPLASHING OVER IN
A STEADY TRICKLE.
IN SOME PLACES THE CORPS OF
ENGINEERS HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO
BLOW A HOLE AND LET HER RIP.
WATER IS GUSHING IN A ROARING
STREAM.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
NOW.
THIS IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL.
I SHUFT DEALT WITH THIS.
I JUST HAVE TO HIT THE BATH ROOJ
FOR A SECOND.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT'S LOCKED.
OKAY.
