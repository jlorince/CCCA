FOLKS, THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER
GO GROCERY SHOPPING WHEN YOU'RE
HUNGRY, BUT I SAY THAT'S THE
BEST TIME BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU
EAT BEFORE YOU REACH THE
CHECKOUT COUNTER IS FREE.
THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD.
NATION, AMERICA HAS A CHILDHOOD
OBESITY PROBLEM.
THERE ARE EVEN REPORTS OF SHORT
KIDS BEING ALLOWED ON ROLLER
COASTERS BY LYING ON THEIR SIDE.
WELL, THREE YEARS AGO, THREE
YEARS AGO THE FOOD INDUSTRY
STARTED AN INITIATIVE TO OUR
HEALTHY CHOICES TO CHILDREN.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE BREAKFAST
AISLE, YOU CAN GET WHOLE GRAINS,
WHOLE GRAINS, THIS EXCELLENT
SOURCE OF VITAMIN D.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FIBER.
BUT FOR THE RECORD, NO APPLE.
NOW, THIS ONE, THIS ONE EVEN HAS
A MAZE ON THE BOX.
OKAY.
BECAUSE WE ALL NEED EXERCISE.
RIGHT NOW.
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.
PHEW.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM WINDED.
I WILL FINISH THAT LATER.
BUT THE SNAP, CRACKLE, PARTY
POOPERS IN WASHINGTON THINK
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
THEY WANT TO ENACT STRICT
NUTRITIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR THE
SOURCE OF FOOD THAT CAN BE
ADVERTISED TO CHILDREN AND
ENFORCING TOUGHER STANDARDS WILL
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVERTISE
CEREALS WITH MORE THANKING A
GRAMS OF SUGAR ON SATURDAY
MORNING CARTOONS.
IF YOU CAN'T ADVERTISE CEREAL ON
CARTOONS, KIDS WILL JUST EAT
WHATEVER ELSE IS ADVERTISED.
AND I'M SORRY, BUT ACTION
FIGURES ARE NOT PART OF A
COMPLETE BREAKFAST, ALTHOUGH I
DO BELIEVE THEY'RE MADE OF THE
SAME MATERIAL AS FRUIT LOOPS.
WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL US
WHAT TO FEED OUR CHILDREN?
LEAVE THAT TO THE EXPERTS, LIKE
NAVAL OFFICERS, MANIC DEPRESSIVE
ROW DENTS AND THE CHOCOLATE
UNDEAD.
BESIDES, MOST CEREAL IS HEALTHY
ENOUGH.
IT'S REALLY ABOUT PORTION
CONTROL.
IT'S THE PARENTS' RESPONSIBILITY
TO POUR A SERVING THAT HAS LESS
THAN EIGHT GRAMS OF SUGAR.
LET'S JUST SEE RIGHT HERE.
OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM, MMMM.
IT'S MAGICALLY DELICIOUS.
[APPLAUSE]
NEXT...
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT UP, WE ARE IN A GOLDEN AGE
OF SANDWICH INNOVATIONS.
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS ALONE,
WE'VE BEEN TREATED TO THE K.F.C.
DOUBLE DOWN AND FRIENDLY'S
GRILLED CHEESE BURGER MELT.
IN LIEU OF FLOWERS, NEXT OF KIN
WOULD LIKE AN ORDER OF ONION
RINGS.
WELL, NOW THE FAST FOOD CHAIN
CARL'S, JR., HAS BROKEN BOLD NEW
GROUND IN THE FIELD OF
SANDWICHOLOGY.
THEY'VE INTRODUCED THE FOOT-LONG
CHEESEBURGER, 20 GRAMS OF
SATURATED FAT, $850 AND IT'S
ONLY $4.50, PLUS WHATEVER YOUR
DEDUCTIBLE IS.
BUT I SAY WHY STOP AT A FOOT.
THE AVERAGE HUMAN HAS OVER 7.5
METERS OF INTENSE TIN.
WHY NOT CREATE A 25-FOOT BURGER
DESIGNED TO FILL EVERY INCH OF
YOUR GUT?
THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL YOU KNOW
YOU'RE FULL.
FINALLY, FOLKS, SOMETIMES WE
FORGET THAT EATING IS A
MIRACULOUS PROCESS.
WE SWALLOW THE FOOD WHICH
SOMEHOW OUR BODY CONVERTS INTO
ENERGY, WHICH WE THEN USE TO
SHOTGUN A CAN OF HOT RANCH
PRINGLES.
THAT'S WHAT REALLY SEPARATES MAN
FROM MACHINE.
UNTIL NOW.
MEET ECOBOUGHT 3, AN AUTONOMY
ROBOT WITH AN ARTIFICIAL STOMACH
THAT ALLOWS IT TO POWER ITSELF
BY EATING.
IT'S ALL PART OF SCIENTIST'S
CONTINUING QUEST TO DEVELOP
SOMEONE TO GO TO DINNER WITH.
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT DOES ECOBOUGHT 3
CONSIDER A MEAL.
PARTIALLY PROCESSED SEWAGE.
GRAPES.
NOW EVEN OUR DOMINANCE AT EATING
CRAP IS BEING THREATENED BY
ROBOTS, WHO CAN ACTUALLY EAT
CRAP.
EVEN SCARIER IS WHAT HAPPENS
NEXT.
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU IS
VERY GRAPHIC, SO IF YOU OR YOUR
ROOMBA HAVE JUST EATEN, YOU MAY
WANT TO TURN AWAY.
>> HE'S HAD ONE CRISP.
>> Stephen: IT POOS.
THEY DEVELOPED A ROBOT THAT GOES
NUMBER TWO.
ALTHOUGH THEY USE BINARY, SO
TECHNICALLY IT GOES NUMBER 10.
I SAY KNOCK IT OFF, SCIENTISTS.
FOOD SHOULD NOT BE EATEN BY SOME
PILE OF JUNK MADE IN A LAB.
FOOD SHOULD BE A PILE
