>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN
AUTHOR AND HISTORIAN.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED FACTS
ARE SUBVERSIVE.
THAT'S WHY HI MY
ENCYCLOPEDIA ARRESTED.
PLEASE WELCOME TIMOTHY
GARTON ASH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, Mr. GARTON ASH, THANKS
SO MUCH.
NOW THE NAME OF YOUR BOOK IS
CALLED FACTS ARE SUBVERSIVE.
POLITICAL WRITINGS FROM A
DECADE WITHOUT A NAME.
WHAT DOW MEAN FACTS ARE
SUBVERSIVE?
>> I MEAN EXACTLY WHAT IT
SAYS.
FOR EXAMPLE --.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS, THOUGH.
I MEAN I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED
THE QUESTION IF I UNDERSTOOD
THAT.
>> IF WE HAD MET, THE
FACTSES ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN,
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,
NAMELY HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.
>> RIGHT.
>> BRITAIN WOULD NOT HAVE
GONE TO WAR IN IRAQ.
MAYBE THE UNITED STATES
WOULD.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
ARE THE FACTS IMPORTANT
THERE.
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE A FAN
OF FACTS.
BECAUSE FEELING IS FIRST.
AND IT FELT RIGHT TO GET
SADDAM, DID IT NOT FEEL
LIKE -- SEEMS LIKE A BAD GUY,
SEEMED DANGEROUS.
FEELS LIKE TAKE THEM DOWN.
LATER THE FACTS SUBVERTED
THAT GOOD FEELING.
SO WHAT GOOD ARE THE FACTS?
>> IN SUBVERTING THAT GOOD
FEELING.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO MAKE
ME FEEL BAD.
>> I WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL
BAD.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> Stephen: IF YOU FEEL THAT
WAY.
I BELIEVE IN THE
REALITY-BASED COMMUNITY.
I MEAN --.
>> Stephen: REALITY IS
PRETTY SAD.
>> Stephen: IT CAN BE BUT
THEN WE HAVE MORE NEED OF
COMEDIANS.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT F
YOU FIND A GOOD ONE, TELL ME
ABOUT HIM.
>> WHERE MIGHT I LOOK.
>> Stephen: JON STEWART.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S REALLY FUNNY.
HE'S REALLY FUNNY.
LET ME ASK YOU, POLITICAL
WRITING FROM A DECADE
WITHOUT A NAME THIS PAST
DECADE, YOU MEAN.
>> IT'S A WEIRD DECADE WHICH
IN A WAY BEGINS WITH 9/11
AND I THINK ENDS ON THE
FOURTH OF NOVEMBER 2008 WHEN
BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED
PRESIDENT.
AND I THINK THE VERY
DIFFERENT AGENDA COMES
BECAUSE OBAMA'S ELECTION
COMES WITH A FINANCIAL AND
ECONOMIC CRISIS.
AND SUDDENLY THAT WHOLE
NARRATIVE WHICH IS THAT
WE'RE LIVING THROUGH THE
FOURTH WORLD WAR, THAT WORLD
HISTORY FOR THE NEXT 20, 30
YEARS WILL IS ALL GOING TO
BE ABOUT THE BATTLE WITH
ISLAMIST TERRORISM T DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE QUITE LIKE THAT
ANY MORE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE
BATTLE?
WHERE IS THE FOURTH WORLD
WAR?
>> I'M NOT SURE.
LET'S HOPE THERE ISN'T THE
FOURTH WORLD WAR BUT WHAT I
DO THINK, I HAVE AN ACCOUNT
IN THIS BOOK OF A VERY
EXTRAORDINARY MEETING WITH
GEORGE W BUSH IN THE EARLY
SUMMER OF 2001.
DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: HI AN
EXTRAORDINARY MEETING WITH
HIM TOO ONCE.
BUT GO AHEAD.
>> I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
THAT.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> BUT THE THING ABOUT THAT
MEETING, IT WAS TWO HOURS
BEFORE HIS FIRST OFFICIAL
TRIP TO EUROPE.
ISLAMISM, ISLAM HARDLY
FEATURED.
FOR HIM THE WHOLE STORY WAS
ABOUT THE GREAT POLITICAL
RIVALRY WITH CHINA.
AND IN A CURIOUS WAY TEN
YEARS LATER, WE'RE SORT OF
BACK AT THAT OTHER STORY
ABOUT THE GREAT RIVALRY WITH
CHINA.
>> Stephen: THIS WAS A
DETOUR FOR THE PAST TEN
YEARS.
>> IN A CURIOUS WAY IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: SHOULD I AN
AFRAID OF CHINA.
SHOULD I HAVE KEPT MY FEAR
ON CHINA.
BECAUSE I DO NEED TO KNOW
WHOM TO BE AFRAID OF.
BECAUSE FEAR IS A GREAT
MOTIVATOR.
>> YOU CANNOT BE AFRAID OF
MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME.
>> Stephen: NO, I SUPPOSE I
CAN.
I USED TO BE AFRAID OF THE
SOVIET UNION AND CHINA AT
THE SAME TIME.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: ARE WE IN THE
WEST, ARE WE ANYTHING ANY
MORE?
IS THERE A WEST IF THERE
ISN'T AN OPPOSITIONAL FORCE
IN THE SOVIET UNION TO
DEFINE US?
>> WELL, THERE ISN'T THE
WEST IN THE SENSE WE HAD IT
DURING THE COLD WAR WHEN THE
UNITES STATES STATES AND
WESTERN EUROPE BASICALLY
ALWAYS GOT TOGETHER.
BECAUSE WE HAD A COMMON
ENEMY.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT
IS NOW.
OBAMA'S FIRST THOUGHT IS NOT,
EVEN BILL BILL CLINTON'S WAS
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH
EUROPE IT MIGHT BE INDIA OR
CHINA OR INDONESIA.
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MANY
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TOO.
WE MAY BE LOOKING TO CHINA
AND INDIA FIRST.
>> Stephen: YOU SAY THAT
OBAMA DOESN'T HAVE AN EAST
WEST OUTLOOK.
HE HAS MORE OF A NORTH
SOUTH.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOW MEAN BY
NORTH SOUTH OUTLOOK.
>> WHAT I JUST SAID, THAT HE --.
>> Stephen: BUT AGAIN WHEN I
ASK QUESTIONS IT MEANS I
GENERALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
>> HE DOES NOT INSTINCTIVELY
LOOK TO EUROPE.
AND OBAMA HIMSELF SAYS IN
HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT HE
DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME
PERSONAL EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION TO EUROPE.
AND SO I THINK HE'S A
PRESIDENT FOR THE POST
WESTERN WORLD, ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES THE
UNITED STATES, YOU SAY THAT
THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE
YOU FEAR THEY ARE IN GREAT
DECLINE, IRRECOVERABLE
KLEIN?
>> I THINK IT IS ALMOST A
CASE WEAN BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND EUROPE WHAT I
MIGHT CALL COMPETITIVE
DECAC -- -- DECK DENSE.
>> Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO
WIN THAT.
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN TOO SURE.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO THE CHEESECAKE
FACTORY?
(APPLAUSE)
DEATH BY QHOK LAT, MY
FRIEND.
>> HAVE YOU BEEN TO GREECE
LATELY.
>> Stephen: YES, I HAVE.
TIMOTHY GARTON ASH.
THE FACTS ARE SUBVERSIVE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
