BUT, FOLKS, OTHER THAN GIVING MY
FANS THE CHANCE TO LICK MY
BACKSIDE, I CANNOT THINK OF ONE
GOOD REASON THAT WE NEED A POST
OFFICE.
HERE TO GIVE ME SEVERAL GOOD
REASONS IS FORMER MALE CARRIER
AND AUTHOR OF "THERE'S ALWAYS
WORK AT THE POST OFFICE" PHIL
RUBIO.
DR. RUBIO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S THE BOOK.
"THERE'S ALWAYS WORK AT THE POST
OFFICE."
YOU USED TO WORK AT THE POST
OFFICE.
>> YES, I DID.
STOOP STEEP NOW YOU'RE A
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, CORRECT?
>> YES, AT NORTH CAROLINA A&T
STATE UNIVERSITY IN GREENSBORO.
MY STUDENTS WANTED ME TO GIVE
THEM A SHOUT-OUT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU GOT IT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO CHARGE YOU FOR THAT
UNFORTUNATELY.
WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT WHETHER
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS HERE OR
NOT?
>> TWO WORDS: UNIVERSAL SERVICE.
TWO MILLION ADDRESSES ARE ADDED
EVERY YEAR.
45 MILLION ADDRESS CHANGES, WHO
IS GOING TO DO THAT BESIDES THE
POSTAL SERVICE?
FEDEX, UPS?
>> Stephen: YEAH, THOSE GUYS
WILL DO IT.
>> THEY WON'T.
>> Stephen: IF THEY CAN MAKE
ANY MONEY, THEY WILL DO IT.
THAT'S THE FREE MARKET.
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS A QUASI
SOCIALIST SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT
USE THE FREE MARKET TO GOUGH
EARN WHETHER A STAMP IS ONLY 45
CENTS IF IT GOES TO ALASKA.
>> LEST TALK ABOUT WHAT THE
POSTAL SERVICE REALLY IS.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A GOVERNMENT
AGENCY, BUT IT HAS TO OPERATE ON
A CORPORATE MODEL.
SO IT HAS TO DO A DELICATE
BALANCING ACT.
IT CAN'T BE TOO COMPETITIVE WITH
UPS AND FEMENTDEX.
>> Stephen: THAT'S MY PROBLEM
WITH THE POST OFFICE.
IT'S NOT COMPETITIVE IN THE REAL
WORLD.
>> WELL, IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE
COMPETITIVE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU NOT HEAR
THAT.
[KNOCKING]
THAT MEANS I WON.
>> IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE
COMPETITIVE.
THERE ARE CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS
THAT TELL IT THAT IT CAN'T
COMPETE WITH UPS OR FEDEX IN
CERTAIN AREAS.
>> Stephen: HERE'S WHERE I
THINK THE REAL PROBLEM IS.
THE POST OFFICE IS A
PUBLIC-PRIVATE HYBRID.
IT'S CONTROLLED BY CONGRESS BUT
RECEIVES NO TAXPAYER MONEY.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THEY SHOULD...
THEY SHOULD FLIP THAT.
THAT'S A TERRIBLE BUSINESS PLAN.
THEY SHOULD BE MORE LIKE
HALLIBURTON, WHICH GETS LOTS OF
TAXPAYER MONEY AND IS CONTROLLED
BY NO ONE.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WILL YOU TELL THOSE PEOPLE?
>> BUT THEN IT WOULDN'T BE...
BUT THEN IT WON'T BE THE POSTAL
SERVICE, WHICH AGAIN GOES
EVERYWHERE.
IT DELIVERS EVERYWHERE.
>> Stephen: OH, HALLIBURTON
WILL GO ANYWHERE AND THEY'LL
DELIVER ANYTHING YOU WANT FOR
THE RIGHT PRICE.
>> ONE THING THAT PEOPLE CAN DO
TO SAVE... IF THEY'RE INTERESTED
IN SAVING AMERICA'S POSTAL
SERVICE, I WOULD INVITE YOU TO
JOIN THAT, TOO, IT'S CALLED SAVE
AMERICA'S POSTAL SERVICE DOT
ORG.
THE POSTAL UNIONS HAVE GOTTEN
TOGETHER AND THEY'LL BE HOLDING
RALLIES IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
YOU CAN GO ON THE THEIR WEB
SITE, SAVE AMERICA'S POSTAL
SERVICE DOT ORG.
TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 27th.
THE LOCATIONS WILL BE ANNOUNCED
TWO DAYS FROM NOW.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU SURE
THEY'RE GOING THE HAPPEN?
WHAT IF IT RAINS OR SLEETS OR
SNOWS AT NIGHT?
>> FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION
THAT.
I WORKED FOR THE POST OFFICE FOR
20 YEARS.
THERE WERE BLIZZARDS.
THERE WERE HURRICANES.
AND WE OPENED A DAY OR TWO
AFTERWARDS AS MOST, WHEREAS MY
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER
RECENTLY WAS DOWN FOR A WEEK IN
OUR AREA CODE.
I WAS CALLING INDIA EVERY WEEK,
CALLING TECH SUPPORT TRYING TO
FIND OUT WHEN I WOULD BE HOOKED
UP.
THE POST OFFICE KEPT DELIVERING
THE MAIL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THEY WILL BE
MISSED.
PHIL RUBE, YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
"THERE'S ALWAYS WORK AT THE POST
OFFICE."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
