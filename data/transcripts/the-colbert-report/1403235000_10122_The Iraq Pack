( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
WELCOME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, FOLKS.
SIT DOWN.
FOLKS THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, YOU, MY BROTHERS, IT WASGORGEOUSITY AND YUM YUM YUM
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERETONIGHT.
I TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT THE RECENTSURGE OF VIOLENCE IN IRAQ AND
HOW IT CAUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMAWITH HIS MOM JEANS DOWN.
( LAUGHTER )BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
EVERY BRUTAL TERRORIST ONSLAUGHTHAS A SILVER LINING.
IN THIS CASE IT BROUGHT BACK MYOLD PALS, THE IRAQ PACK, AND
THEY ARE SINGING THE SAME OLDTUNES.
>> LOOK, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVEFOUND A WAY TO KEEP AN AMERICAN
PRESENCE IN IRAQ.
>> PRESIDENT BUSH DID EXACTLYTHE RIGHT THING IN OVERTHROWING
SADDAM HUSSEIN.
>> I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQTODAY.
THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT BARACKOBAMA DID.
>> GENERAL PETRAEUS HAD THECONFLICT WON, THANKS TO THE
SURGE.
WE HAD THE CONFLICT WON.
AND WE HAD A STABLE GOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen:  JOHN McCAIN ISRIGHT-- WE HAD THAT CONFLICT WON
IN 2009 WHEN WE LEFT IRAQ APEACEFUL, SMOLDERING DEMOCRACY.
( LAUGHTER )I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE
OF BAGHDAD AT THE HEIGHT OF THESURGE.
♪  ♪ ( CHEERS ).
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
( LAUGHTER )THERE WERE A FEW UPTICKS IN
VIOLENCE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART,WHEN WE LEFT THE SUNNI AND THE
SHIA WERE BRONIES.
IT WAS ESPECIALLY NICE TO SEETHE RETURN OF THE LEADER OF THE
IRAQ PACK, OLD DEAD EYES.
HE CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER HISUNDISCLOSED ROCK TO POINT AN ICY
FINGER OF TRUTH AT BARACK OBAMA.
IN AN OP-ED IN WHAT MANY ARECALLING THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL," CHENEY WRITES, "RARELYHAS A U.S. PRESIDENT BEEN SO
WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH AT THEEXPENSE OF SO MANY."
YES, RARELY, MAYBE ONLY ONEOTHER TIME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
OF COURSE, THE LIBERALS, THELIBERALS--
( CHEERS ), OF COURSE, THE LIBERAL MEDIA
WENT RIGHT AFTER HIM, ESPECIALLYLEFT WING LOON MEGYN KELLY.
>> TIME AND TIME AGAIN, HISTORYHAS PROVEN THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG
AS WELL IN IRAQ, SIR.
YOU SAID THERE WAS NO DOUBTSADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION.
YOU SAID WE WOULD BE GREETED ASLIBERATORS.
YOU SAID THE IRAQ INSURGENCY WASIN THE LAST THROES BACK IN 2005.
AND YOU SAID THAT AFTER OURINTERVENTION EXTREMISTS WOULD
HAVE TO "RETHINK THEIR STRATEGYOF JIHAD."
NOW WITH ALMOST $1 TRILLIONSPENT THERE, WITH 4500 AMERICAN
LIVES LOST THERE, WHAT DO YOUSAY TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU WERE SO
WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH AT THEEXPENSE OF SO MANY?
>> NO, I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE,REAGAN-- MEGYN.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:  THAT WAS NOMISTAKE.
AS A TRUE CONSERVATIVE, EVERYSENTENCE HAS TO CONTAIN AT LEAST
ONE REAGAN.
( LAUGHTER )AND HE JUST FUNDAMENTALLY
DISAGREES WITH REALITY.
IT'S EASY NOW TO MONDAY MORNING"NOT INVADE IRAQ" BUT DICK
CHENEY REMEMBERS HOW IT FELT ATTHE TIME SO RIGHT.
>> YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK ANDLOOK AT THE TRACK RECORD.
WE INHERITED A SITUATION WHERETHERE WAS NO DOUBT IN ANYBODY'S
MIND ABOUT THE EXTENT OFSADDAM'S INVOLVEMENT IN WEAPONS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
>> Stephen:  THERE WAS NODOUBT ABOUT THE EXTENT OF
SADDAM'S INVOLVEMENT INW.M.D.s, BUT WE DID THE RIGHT
THING AND INVADED ANYWAY.
FOLKS, IT TAKES HUEVOSRANCHEROS TO BLAME THE
OUTCOME OF THE WAR YOU STARTEDON THE MAN WHO ENDED IT.
IN FACT, I'D SAY THOSE THINGSHE'S SWINGING COULD BE BALLS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION, WHICH MEANS WEHAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO INVADE
DICK CHENEY'S SACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WE HAVE GOT SATELLITE IMAGERY OFTHIS MAN'S NUTS, AND HE IS
DEFINITELY HIDING SOMETHING DOWNTHERE, MAYBE ALUMINUM TUBES.
I DON'T KNOW.
NOW, FOR NATIONAL SECURITYREASONS I CANNOT SHOW THEM TO
YOU.
JUST TRUST ME THAT THE WHITEPOWDER IN COLIN POWELL'S VIAL
THIS TIME IS GOLD BOND.
