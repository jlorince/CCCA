(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: IT IS WELL KNOWN
BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN VIOLATINGTHE CONSTITUTION FOR YEARS.
WELL, NOW APPARENTLY HE WANTS TOROLL IT UP, STUFF IT WITH RICE
AND BEANS, AND SMOTHER IT INPICANTE SAUCE.
>> A SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS ASEARLY AS NEXT WEEK, PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS PLANNING TO ANNOUNCE ATEN-PART PLAN TO OVERHAUL
IMMIGRATION POLICY THROUGHEXECUTIVE ACTION.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA VOWING TO GOIT ALONE ON IMMIGRATION.
>> HE PLANS TO PASS EXECUTIVEACTION IMMIGRATION AMNESTY JUST
BY HIMSELF, WITHOUT CONGRESS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, HOW DARE HETAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS
IMMIGRATION, BY HIMSELF?
HE SHOULD BE WORKING WITHCONGRESS, TO DO NOTHING,
TOGETHER.
EVEN WORSE, THE RUMOR IS HE'SGOING TO OVERHAUL THE
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THROUGH FIAT.
FIAT?
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG -- YOUHAVE TO ORDER NEW PARTS FROM
ITALY. IT'S MADNESS
AND JUST LISTEN TO WHAT'S INOBAMA'S PLAN.
IT WOULD "PROTECT UP TO5 MILLION UNAUTHORIZED
IMMIGRANTS FROM THE THREAT OFDEPORTATION AND PROVIDE MANY OF
THEM WITH WORK PERMITS.
THEY GET TO STAY AND RECEIVEWORK PERMITS!
NOW THEY'RE COMING FOR THE JOBSTHEY ALREADY HAVE!
THIS WHOLE PLAN CHEAPENS WHAT ITMEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN...
BECAUSE "THE DEPARTMENTOF HOMELAND SECURITY WOULD TAKE
50% OFF THE FEE FOR THE FIRST10,000 APPLICANTS."
50% OFF.
OBAMA'S JUST TOSSING AMERICANCITIZENSHIP IN THE BARGAIN BIN
WITH THE STALE HALLOWEEN CANDYAND UNBAGGED UNDERWEAR.
PLUS, OBAMA'S GOING TO "EXPANDVISAS FOR FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS
WITH HIGH-TECH SKILLS."
WHY FOREIGNERS?
AMERICANS ALREADY HAVE PLENTY OFHIGH-TECH SKILLS.
LIKE OPERATING AN iPhone TOCONTACT A CALL CENTER IN INDIA.
WELL, THANK GOD THIS PLANLEAKED!
BECAUSE NOW CONGRESSIONALREPUBLICANS CAN STOP IT.
>> WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THEPRESIDENT TOOTH AND NAIL IF HE
CONTINUES DOWN THIS PATH.
THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO GOVERN.
OUR GOAL HERE IS TO STOP THEPRESIDENT FROM VIOLATING HIS OWN
OATH OF OFFICE AND VIOLATING THECONSTITUTION.
IT'S NOT TO SHUT DOWN THEGOVERNMENT.
WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS.
THEY ARE ON THE TABLE.
>> Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT,OBAMA?
ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE.THAT MEANS
LAWSUITS, IMPEACHMENT,GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, BOOTS ON
THE GROUND, PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVENOTES ON THE FRIDGE.
BUT MOSTLY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUTCASH.
>> IF THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TOTRY TO USURP OUR AUTHORITY IN
CONGRESS, I THINK WE NEED TOBITE BACK AND NOT GIVE HIM THE
FUNDS TO DO THAT.
>> WE WILL USE THE POWER OF THEPURSE TO TRY TO PUSH BACK
AGAINST HIS OVERACTIVEBUREAUCRACY.
>> THEY SHOULD HANDLE IT THROUGHDEFUNDING WHAT THEY CAN
DEFUND -- KEEPING BACK MONEYFROM AREAS WHERE HE NEEDS MONEY
TO CARRY OUT THESE ILLEGALACTIONS.
>> Stephen: YES, THE PRESIDENTIS REFUSING TO DEPORT THESE
ILLEGALS, SO WE MUST CUT THEFUNDING TO PAY THE IMMIGRATION
OFFICERS HE WON'T NEED TO NOTDEPORT THEM.
IT'S LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID AND IREFUSED TO RAKE THE YARD, SO AS
A PUNISHMENT MY PARENTS WOULDN'TBUY ME A RAKE.
REALLY TAUGHT ME A LESSON.
TO THIS DAY, I DON'T RAKE MYYARD.
I PAY LUIS TO DO IT.
I ASSUME HE'S A CITIZEN.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S A CITIZEN,
HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
AND I PAY HIM IN CASH.
BUT HOW DOES THE LATINOCOMMUNITY FEEL ABOUT ALL OF THIS
TO FIND OUT WHAT THE GRANDEHISPANA-CHINOS THINK
I TURN ONE LAST TIME TO MYMEXICAN COLLEAGUE, ESTEBAN
COLBERTO!
>> HOLA, STEPHEN!

>> Stephen: SO, MY DEAR FRIEND,EVERYBODY DOWN IN YOUR NECK OF
THE CACTUS MUST BE THRILLED WITHPRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> PRESIDENTE OBAMA?
>> Stephen: SO WILL THIS MAKELATINOS VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS
IN THE FUTURE?
>> Stephen: YES, BUT WHATTHEY'RE TRYING TO SAY IS --
>> Stephen: BUT IF THIS PLANGOES INTO EFFECT, WILL YOU BE
TAKING OBAMA'S IMMIGRATIONHANDOUT?
>> Stephen: YOU CAN GET THOSEIN MEXICO?
>> SI.
BUT I GOT MINE FROM PENN STATE.
>> Stephen: WHAT THE (BLEEP)?!

YEARS?
