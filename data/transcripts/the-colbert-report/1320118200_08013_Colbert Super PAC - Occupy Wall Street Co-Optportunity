MORE.
FOLKS, THIS WEEKEND, OCTOBER 29,
THE NORTHEAST WAS SLAMMED BY A
BLIZZARD MEANING WE COULD BE
LOOKING AT NEARLY SIX MONTHS OF
WINTER.
AS A RESULT, SATURDAY EVENING
PUNXSATAWNEY PHIL BLEW HIS
BRAINS OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS... SAD, SAD, HE'LL BE
MISSED.
FOLKS, THIS WEATHER HAS GOT ME
WORRIED ABOUT THOSE CRAZY KIDS
DOWN AT OCCUPY WALL STREET.
WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE,
PARTLY BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT
THEM THROUGH TINTED WINDOW
LIMOS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE SO
WRONG.
BUT, FOLKS, THIS IS AMERICA, I
BELIEVE EVERYONE DESERVES THE
CHANCE TO AGREE WITH ME.
WHAT THEY REALLY NEED IS A FIRM,
GUIDING HAND TO HELP THEM BUILD
A REAL POLITICAL MOVEMENT.
THE WAY G.O.P. BIGWIG DICK ARMEY
DID FOR THE TEA PARTY.
>> THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE TEA
PARTY, I THINK, AND THESE WALL
STREET PROTESTS, THE TEA PARTY
FROM THE FIRST WAS WELL
CONNECTED TO REPUBLICAN PARTY
CIRCLES, CONSERVATIVE BUSINESS
PEOPLE LIKE FREEDOM WORK WHICH
IS IS RUN BY DICK ARMEY WHO'S A
FORMER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER.
>> DICK ARMEY OF FREEDOM WORKS
WHO IS A TEA PARTY FOUNDER SAID
"OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE OVER
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY."
>> Stephen: SEE?
BIG SWINGING DICK ARMEY GAVE THE
TEA PARTYERS THE CASH AND THE
ORGANIZATION THEY NEEDED TO TAKE
OVER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
SO FOR ALL OCCUPY WALL STREET
HAS TAKEN OVER IS THE BATHROOM
AT STARBUCKS.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, IF ARMEY'S POLITICAL
ACTION COMMITTEE CAN COOPERATE
THE TEA PARTY, I SAY WHY CAN'T
COLBERT SUPERPACT CO-OPT OCCUPY
SWEET IN
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S A WIN-WIN.
OKAY?
THESE GUYS DOWN HERE, THEY GET A
POLITICAL PLAYER WITH DEEP
POCKETS TO HELP THEM REACH THE
NEXT LEVEL AND I GET A
NATIONWIDE ARMY TO SPREAD THEIR
MESSAGE OF MY MESSAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S A NATURAL FIT, FOLKS.
REMEMBER, I WAS VERY ANGRY AT
WALL STREET TWO YEARS AGO.
>> LET'S GO GET A.I.G.!
WHOO!
FOLKS, TWO YEARS LATER I AM
STILL, YOU KNOW, MAD AT THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
STOP IT, YOU GUYS, SERIOUSLY.
STOP IT
