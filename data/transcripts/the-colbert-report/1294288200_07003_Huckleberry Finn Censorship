THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, I
CHANT THE SAME THING EVERY
MORNING.
GETS ME UP.
( LAUGHTER )
NATION, I AM ON RECORD AS BEING
A HUGE FAN OF CENSORSHIP.
OF COURSE, YOU WON'T FIND IT IN
THE RECORD.
I HAD IT TAKEN OUT.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO THRILLED TO
HEAR ABOUT A NEW EDITION OF THE
MARK TWAIB CLASSIC "THE
ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN."
THIS LOOK HAS LONG BEEN
CONTROVERSIAL FOR ITS FRANK
PORTRAYAL OF SLAVERY, BUT I WAS
ALWAYS A BIG FAN.
MY FAVORITE CHARACTER WAS JIM.
HE WAS SO GREAT, I WANT ONE OF
MY OWN.
BUT NOW THIS CLASSIC OF AMERICAN
LITERATURE IS IN FOR SOME BIG
CHANGES.
JIM.
>> HUCKLEBERRY FINN, YOU MAY
HAVE READ IT AS A CHILD, BUT
INCREASINGLY SCHOOLS ARE
CHOOSING NOT TO INCLUDE IT IN
CURRICULUMS BECAUSE OF THE "N"
WORD.
THE EDITORS OF NEW SOUTH BOOKS
ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
THEY'RE PUBLISHING A NEW EDITION
WITHOUT THE "N" WORD.
IT'S USED 200 TIMES IN HUCK
FINN.
>> Stephen: HE DROPPED THE "N"
WORD OVER 200 TIMES.
THAT PROVES MARK TWAIN WASN'T
JUST HIS PEN NAME.
IT WAS HIS RAP NAME.
THE WEST SIDE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK
TIMES," WHICH BY THE WAY IS MY
"N" WORD, THE NEW EDITION'S
PUBLISHER IS REPLACING IT
THROUGHOUT THE BOOK WITH THE
WORD "SLAVE."
IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO
MODERNTIZE LANGUAGE, THEY WOULD
HAVE REPLACED THE WORD "SLAVE"
WITH THE WORD "INTERN."
THE PUBLISHER SAYS THEY TOOK OUT
THE OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE TO
COUNTER THE PREEMPTIVE
CENSORSHIP GOING ON AT THE
SCHOOL LEVEL.
I SAY WHY BOTH CENTER IT'S TIGHT
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
AS LONG AS THE "N" WORD DOESN'T
APPEAR IN THE CLIFF NOTES,
YOU'RE ALL GOOD.
STILL, AS LONG AS WE'RE
IMPROVING MARK TWAIN'S
MASTERPIECE, I SAY THE
CENSORSHIP DOES NOT GO FAR
ENOUGH, FOLKS.
AFTER ALL, WHEN TWAIN WROTE HUCK
FINN, THE "N" WORD WASN'T NEARLY
AS OFFENSIVE AS IT IS NOW.
WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER WORDS IT
CONTAINS THAT ARE OKAY NOW THAT
SOME DAY MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE.
LIKE THE TITLE HUCK FINN.
THAT COULD EVENTUALLY REFER TO
THE DEEPLY OFFENSIVE PASTIME OF
SEEING WHO CAN THROW A FINISH
PERSON THE FURTHEST.
HERE'S A TIP, HERE'S A TIP:
THEY'RE LIGHTEST IN LATE WINTER.
ANYWAY, I THINK ALL OF THIS IS A
GREAT MOVE.
MY ONLY WORRY HERE, WHAT ARE
PUBLISHERS GOING TO DO WITH ALL
THOSE N WORDS THEY TAKE OUT.
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO PILE UP
AROUND THE OFFICE.
THEY MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY END UP
IN OTHER CLASSIC, AND FRANKLY I
DON'T WANT TO READ MY K
