NATION, CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS
ARE SO DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR
COUNTRY.
THEY CRIPPLED OUR NATION'S ONCE
THRIVING ASBESTOS INDUSTRY.
NOW THOSE POUR ASBESTOS RANCHERS
ARE OUT OF WORK.
AND THEY NEEDED THOSE JOBS THEY
HAVE A LOT OF MEDICAL BILLS TO
PAY.
THERE'S A NEW GO LIAGE UNDER
ASSAULT FROM A GANG OF BLOOD
THIRSTY DAVIDS AND IT BRINGS US
TO TONIGHT'S WORD:  TOO BIG TO
NAIL.
WAL-MART FACES A CLASS ACTION
LAWSUIT FROM 1.5 MILLION FEMALE
EMPLOYEES ALLEGING YEARS OF
GENDER DISCRIMINATION.
ACCORDING TO THE PLAINTIFFS,
WOMEN MAKE UP 70% OF WAL-MART'S
HOURLY EMPLOYEES BUT ONLY HOLD A
THIRD OF MANAGEMENT JOBS PLUS
THE FEMALE MANAGERS EARN $16,000
LESS THAN THEIR MALE
COUNTERPARTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE WOMEN ARE
UPSET.
WALL SMART SLASHING COSTS AND
PASSING THE SAVINGS ON TO THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
IF THEY LOST THE SUIT, WAL-MART
WOULD HAVE OWED MORE THAN $1
BILLION IN BACK PAY.
TO COVER THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO
RAISE THE PRIZE ON EVERYTHING
INCLUDING DR. THUNDER, THEIR
DR. PEPPER KNOCKOFF.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, MAYBE -- MAYBE THESE WOMEN
WERE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST,
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE THE
SUPREME COURT UNDERSTOOD THE
REAL ISSUE HERE AND DID THE
RIGHT THING.
>> THE SUPREME COURT THREW OUT
THE CASE RULING THAT THE CLASS
WAS TOO VARIED.
WAL-MART'S 1.5 MILLION FEMALE
EMPLOYEES QUOTE "HELD A
MULTITUDE AFTER DIFFERENT JOBS
AT DIFFICULT LEVELS FOR VARIABLE
LENGTHS OF TIMES IN STORES
SPRINKLED ACROSS 50 STATES."
>> Stephen: GOOD POINT.
THE WAL-MART IS IN FLORIDA IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE
WAL-MART IN ARKANSAS.
JIMMY, I THINK YOU HAVE THOSE
TWO MIXED UP.
THERE YOU GO.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS:  IT'S NOT THE
SINGLE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER
IN THE UNITED STATES REPEATEDLY
VIOLATING THESE WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
IT'S 3400 COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT
LOCATIONS INDIVIDUALLY VIOLATING
THEIR RIGHTS IN DIFFERENT UNIQUE
WAYS.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, EACH SEXUAL
DISCRIMINATION IS LIKE AN
INDIVIDUAL SNOWFLAKE.
BESIDES, WAL-MART AS A WHOLE
CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE
WAL-MART'S LEAD ATTORNEY THE
COMPANY -- QUOTE -- "HAS A VERY
STRONG POLICY AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION AND IN FAVOR OF
DIVERSITY."
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE EMPLOYEE
MANUAL NEXT TO EMPLOYEES MUST
WASH HANDS.
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THESE WOMEN,
DON'T WORRY, THE COURT SAYS IT'S
STILL OKAY FOR YOU TO SUE
WAL-MART.
JUST BE SURE YOU HIRE THE BEST
LEGAL TEAM AN $8 AN HOUR CASHIER
CAN BUY.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE THANKS TO THE SUPREME
COURT, YOU WILL HAVE TO SUE THEM
AS AN INDIVIDUAL, BUT THE $420
BILLION CORPORATION GETS TO
FIGHT YOU AS A TEAM.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS, NOW
THAT I THINK OF IT THAT DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR.
IF WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GANG UP
ON THE CORPORATIONS THEN THE
INDIVIDUALS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED
TO SUE AT ALL BUT WHAT IS AN
INDIVIDUAL BUT A GANG OF GREEDY
ORGANS?
IF WOMEN MAKE ON AVERAGE 75% OF
WHAT A MAN MAKES, THEN ONLY THE
258% OF HER -- 258% OF HER --
25% OF HERE DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
SUE.
SAME FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
ONLY THE HARASSED PART OF A
WOMAN'S BODY SHOULD HAVE LEGAL
STANDING.
I SAY BRAVO SUPREME COURT FOR
TRULY GRANTING SEAL EQUALITY IN
THE WORK PLACE BECAUSE
