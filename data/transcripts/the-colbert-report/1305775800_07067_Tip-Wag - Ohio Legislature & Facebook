NAVY SEALS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I DON'T JUST PASS JUDGMENT, I
CUT IT OFF IN TRAFFIC AND FLIP
IT THE BOARD.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S NO SECRET.
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED OHIO FROM THE
TIME HIS A LAYOVER THERE TO THE
TIME I DROVE THROUGH THERE.
IT'S WIDER THAN YOU THINK.
NOW THERE'S ANOTHER REASON TO
VISIT THE BUCKEYE STATE.
WE TURN TO CINCINNATI'S NEWS
LEADER.
>> THE OHIO HOUSE HAS PASSED A
BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE WITH
CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS TO HAVE
A GUN IN A BAR, RESTAURANT OR
SPORTS STADIUM.
>> Stephen: SOUNDS DANGEROUS,
BUT REMEMBER ANY BASEBALL GAME
ALREADY CARRIES THE RISK YOU
MIGHT DIE OF BOREDOM.
I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY HAT TO
THE OHIO LEGISLATURE FOR GIVING
PITCHER'S DUEL A WHOLE NEW
MEANING.
I SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME WE LET
GUNS INTO STADIUMS FILLED WITH
TESTOSTERONE FILLED FANS PRONE
TO VIOLENCE.
BEST OF ALL MY LIFE PARTNER
SWEETNESS IS A HUGE SPORTS NUT
AND I'LL FINALLY BE ABLE TO
BRING HER TO THE GAME.
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE WE'LL EVEN GET
ON THE KISS CAM!
[LAUGHTER]
NOW THEY LOVED YOU, HONEY.
REPUBLICANS SAY THE
REPRESENTATIVE DANNY BUBKA --
[LAUGHTER]
EXPLAINED WHY HIS BILL IS SO
VITAL.
-- QUOTE -- "YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
COUNT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT
YOURSELF."
AND HE SHOULD KNOW.
WHERE WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN
THOSE VOWELS WERE STOLEN FROM
HIS LAST NAME?
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT BIG TIP OF MY HAT TO THE
FACEBOOK FOR INSTITUTING A NEW
POLICY ALLOWING USERS TO ADD
TAGS FOR BRAND NAME PRODUCTS IN
THE PHOTOS.
OMG Y'ALL CHILLING AT THE YOGA
STUDIO WITH MY BEST FRIEND COKE
C.
NOW I CAN REALIZE MY LIFELONG
CREAM OF BEING TARGETED BY
TARGET AND GED SPAMMED BY SPAM.
THIS ISSUED IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD
OF PERSONAL PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
REMEMBER CHARLIE SHEEN GOT PAID
PER TWEET TO START PLUGGING
PRODUCTS ON TWITTER?
NEITHER DOES HE.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, NOW AMERICANS CAN WHORE
THEMSELVES OUT ON FACEBOOK
INSTEAD OF JUST WHORING THEM
THEMSELVES OUT ON CRAIGSLIST.
PHOTO TAGGERS COULD CHARGE
COMPANIES BASED ON THEIR NUMBER
OF FRIENDS AND DEMAND TOP DOLLAR
FOR TAGS IN THEIR MOST VIEWED
PHOTOS.
THINK OF ALL THE WINDFALL YOU
COULD REAP FROM DROPPING
PRODUCTS INTO THE MOST PRECIOUS
LIFE MOMENTS LIKE WEDDINGS,
PW *EURTDZ AND -- BIRTHS AND
FUNERALS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
I KNOW HE'S ADVERTISING MOUNTAIN
DEW BUT HE WILL
