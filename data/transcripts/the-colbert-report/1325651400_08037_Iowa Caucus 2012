>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
"REPORT"!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WHAT A WONDERFUL WAY TO START
THE YEAR.
I HAD A FANTASTIC CHRISTMAS
VACATION, HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD
ONE, TOO.
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.
WE ARE BACK, CORRECT?
WE ARE BACK?
OKAY, GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE
I DO NOT GO ANYWHERE.
I HAVE BEEN HERE BEHIND THIS
DESK THE ENTIRE TIME SHOUTING IN
THE DARK.
ABOUT A HALF HOUR AGO THESE
PEOPLE SHOWED UP, THE CAMERA GUY
SHOWED UP.
THEY TURNED UP THE LIGHTS, I
ASSUME THAT MEANS WE'RE BACK ON
THE AIR.
FOLKS, IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK
BECAUSE TONIGHT IS THE BIGGEST
POLITICAL STORY OF THE CENTURY.
THE OHIO... NO, I'M SORRY, THAT
IS THE IOWA...
(LAUGHTER).
THE IOWA CAUCUSES.
THE CAUCUSI?
LET'S CHECK ON THAT.
EITHER WAY, IT'S THE SUPERBOWL
OF OLD MIDWESTERN PEOPLE IN A
HIGH SCHOOL GYM SITTING IN
FOLDING CHAIRS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, NO ONE IS ON THIS
STORY LIKE I AM TONIGHT!
I AM BRINGING YOU EVERY CORNER
OF THE STATE, THE MOST COMPLETE
COVERAGE I COULD GET FROM FREE
WEB CAMS.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'RE TALKING THE COUNTY
COURTHOUSE LIVE PARKING LOT WEB
CAM.
A HIGHWAY CAM ON I THINK THAT IS
THE IOWA AVENUE BRIDGE OVER THE
IOWA RIVER.
THEY'RE A CREATIVE PEOPLE.
AND THE IOWA CORN CAM CATCHING
UP ON ALL THE UP-TO-THE-MINUTE
DEVELOPMENTS WITH AN EAR OF IOWA
CORN.
AND, OF COURSE, THE REPORT
REPORT CAM CAM THAT FILM IT IS
CAMERA THAT IS FILMING THE WEB
SITE.
NOW, NORMALLY WE BROADCAST LIVE
AT 11:30 EVERY NIGHT.
BUT TONIGHT I AM PRETAPING MY
SHOW AT 7:00 SO I COULD GET HOME
IN TIME TO CATCH THE START OF
THE HYPING OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO KNOW THE
WINNER OF IOWA YET, THAT WILL
NOT KEEP ME FROM BEING THE FIRST
TO CALL THIS RACE.
I CAN ALREADY SAY WHO WILL
LOSE-- JON HUNTSMAN.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO IS COMPLETELY SKIPPING IOWA
TO FOCUS ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AND TO
ADD INSULT TO INJURY, HE ADDED
AN INSULT.
JIM?
>> THEY PICK CORN IN IOWA.
THEY ACTUALLY PICK PRESIDENTS
HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: YES.
NEW HAMPSHIRE PICKS PRESIDENTS.
JUST ASK PRESIDENTS BUCHANAN,
AND TSONGAS.
THAT WAS A THOUGHTLESS INSULT BY
HUNTSMAN AND I AM PERSONALLY
OFFENDED.
NOT FOR IOWA, THEY ARE PIG
FARMERS AND IT'S A MIRACLE THEIR
STATE FLAG IS NOT A PAIR OF
OVERALLS.
(LAUGHTER)
NO, I AM OFFENDED FOR CORN!
HOW DARE JON HUNTSMAN INSULT
AMERICA'S NATIONAL CALORIE
PELLET?
ALL AMERICANS DO IS EAT CORN!
WE CONSUME IT IN ALL PHASES OF
MATTER-- SOLID, LIQUID, COOL
RANCH.
(LAUGHTER)
AT THIS POINT, AMERICANS ARE 98%
CORN AND IF YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT
THEN CORN IS PICKING THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!
SHOW IT SOME RESPECT, HUNTSMAN.
REMEMBER THE PLEDGE OF
ALLEGIANCE.
(LAUGHTER)
ONE NATION, UNDER COB, INDANIBBL
INDANIBBLE WITH LIBERTY AND
FRUCTOSE FOR ALL.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
SO WE KNOW WHO'S OUT.
BUT WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THIS
THING?
BEFORE THE BREAK, IOWA WAS A
SURE THING FOR NEWT GINGRICH--
AFTER IT WAS A SHOE-IN FOR
HERMAN CAIN, A CINCH FOR RICK
PERRY, MONEY IN THE BANK FOR
MICHELE BACHMANN AND GOLD BARS
SEWN INTO A MATTRESS FOR RON
PAUL.
SO IMAGINE MY SHOCK AND SURPRISE
WHEN FORMER SENATOR RICK
SANTORUM STORMED TO THE HEAD OF
THE THIRD PLACE.
(LAUGHTER)
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COUNTED
SANTORUM OUT AS UNELECTABLE OR
AT THE VERY LEAST UNGOOGLABLE.
YOU SEE, A FEW YEARS AGO
SANTORUM COMPARED HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS TO MAN ON DOG SEX.
ANGERING FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND
ENEMY OF FAMILIES DAN SAVAGE WHO
THEN LAUNCHED AN INTERNET
CAMPAIGN TO REDEFINE SANTORUM'S
NAME.
NOW, IF YOU'RE DRINKING A MILK
SHAKE OR EATING A CHOCOLATE
MYSELF I ADVISE YOU TO SET IT
ASIDE BEFORE I READ SAVAGE'S
DEFINITION OF SANTORUM.
"THE FROTHY MIXTURE OF LUBE AND
FECAL MATTER THAT IS SOMETIMES
THE BY-PRODUCT OF ANAL SEX."
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
ARE WE ALL RIGHT?
BUT THANKS TO HIS SURGING
CAMPAIGN, SANTORUM HAS ENDED
THIS UNFAIR ASSOCIATION OF HIS
NAME WITH HOT MAN LOVE.
RIGHT, NEWS PEOPLE?
>> SANTORUM HAS GOT THE BIG MUG.
YOU HAVE A SURGE IN THE BACK END
OF THE POLLING FOR RICK
SANTORUM.
>> Stephen: YUP.
NOTHING GAY.
JUST BIG MO POLLING SANTORUM IN
THE BIG BACK END.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO WHAT EXISTED LIFTED SANTORUM
ABOVE THE FROTH?
WAS IT HIS STRONG CONSERVATIVE
RECORD?
HIS FAMILY VALUES?
HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH?
PARTLY, BUT MOSTLY IT WAS
FASHION.
JIM.
>> I WAS AT A SPEECH TWO WEEKS
AGO AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE... I
JUST HAPPENED TO WEAR A SWEATER
VEST THAT DAY.
THAT SPEECH WENT OVER VERY, VERY
WELL AND IF THERE WAS ONE EVENT
THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT
REALLY BEGAN THE MOMENT IT WAS
THAT SPEECH AND I THINK MOST
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT HERE AND
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SWEATER
VEST, IT WAS LIKE FEAR THE VEST.
>> Stephen: YES.
FEAR THE VEST.
IN IOWA THAT LOOK IS FIERCE!
(LAUGHTER)
WE ALL KNOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY
ELECTORAL POWER HAS HINGED ON
PARTIAL COVERAGE TORSO CLOTHING.
REMEMBER EISENHOWER'S
CUMMERBUND, WOODROW WILSON'S
