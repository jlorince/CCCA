>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS,
THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TONIGHT RIGHT NOW THESE PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO BEGIN.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN ON
HOW TO THANK THESE PEOPLE.
TONIGHT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
ARE NOT JUST AN AUDIENCE.
PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.
I ALMOST CAN'T CONTROL THEM.
THEY'RE NOT AN AUDIENCE.
THEY'RE A MOVEMENT.
AND FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR THAT
OPENING BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO TELL
YOU TONIGHT I AM ANGRY.
AND FOR ONCE THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ME HAPPY.
AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHY.
>> THE SCANDAL-TAINTED FORMER
SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR MARK
SANFORD WON BACK HIS OLD SEAT IN
CONGRESS TUESDAY.
THE SISTER OF STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> Stephen: MY SISTER LOST.
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
I WAS SO SURE LULU HAD WON
BECAUSE CNN CALLED IT FOR
SANFORD.
BUT THE VOTERS -- WHAT CAN I
SAY -- THE VOTERS OF SOUTH
CAROLINA HAVE SPOKEN.
MARK SANFORD BEAT MY SISTER, AND
I BELIEVE THAT MEANS MARK
SANFORD IS NOW MY SISTER.
AND ON BEHALF OF MY ENTIRE
FAMILY, I WANT TO SAY WE'RE
DEEPLY SORRY ABOUT HIM.
NOW I KNOW HOW KEVIN MANSON MUST
HAVE FELT.
I MEAN, I FEEL SO BETRAYED BY
SOUTH CAROLINA.
WELL, IF THEY'RE GOING TO TURN
THEIR BACKS ON MY FAMILY, I'M
TURNING MY BACK ON THEM.
NO, I AM.
FROM NOW ON -- AND I NEVER
THOUGHT I WOULD EVER SAY THIS --
I AM FROM NORTH CAROLINA.
NO, I HAVE TO.
I HAVE TO!
I'M A TAR HEEL NOW WHATEVER THE
[BLEEP] THAT MEANS.
AND AS A NORTH CAROLINAN, I LOVE
OUR STATE BIRD, THE CARDINAL.
THAT'S A STUPID BIRD.
BUT IT'S MINE NOW AND I LOVE IT
AS MUCH AS OUR STATE DOG, THE
PLOTT HOUND.
JESUS, WELL, WHATEVER.
BUT MOST SHOCKINGLY, I WILL NO
LONGER ENJOY SOUTH CAROLINA'S
TANKY, SAVORY, JUICY AND DEEPLY
DELICIOUS BARBECUE, MADE WITH
OUR UNIQUE MUSTARD-BASED SAUCE.
NOW INSTEAD I NOW OFFICIALLY
LOVE NORTH CAROLINA SAUCELESS
VINEGAR-BASED MEAT PRODUCT THAT
THEY CALL BARBECUE.
MMMM.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.
FOR LULU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
MMM.
THAT IS A...
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I MIGHT JUST LEAVE THE REST OF
THAT FOR LATER.
OKAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T DO IT.
I LOVE SOUTH CAROLINA TOO MUCH.
AND I LOVE MY SISTER.
AND I'M SO PROUD OF HER.
BUT I JUST DON'T GET IT.
WHERE DID LULU GO WRONG?
DID SHE NOT CAMPAIGN HARD
ENOUGH?
DID SHE NOT RAISE ENOUGH MONEY?
DID SHE HOLD TOO FEW DEBATES
AGAINST A CARDBOARD NANCY
PELOSI?
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THIS SCARES
ME TO MY CORE.
I'M SHAKING.
THIS WAS THE FIRST POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN WHERE I KNEW AND CARED
ABOUT THE CANDIDATE BEFORE THEY
GOT INTO POLITICS.
I SAW FIRST-HAND HOW HER
OPPONENTS SMEARED HER WITH
OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS I KNEW TO
BE UNTRUE.
AND THAT HAS MADE ME WONDER IF
OTHER CAMPAIGNS HAVE DONE THIS
AS WELL.
I MEAN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT JOHN
McCAIN ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE
AN ILLEGITIMATE BLACK CHILD?
AND DOES THAT MEAN MEGAN
McCAIN IS WHITE?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE
ANYMORE.
AND COULD IT BE THAT "I" HAVE
LIED ABOUT CANDIDATES I DISAGREE
WITH LIKE THAT TIME I SAID THAT
HARRY REID IS JUST A LEATHER
SADDLE BAG BROUGHT TO LIFE BY A
NAVAJO SHAMAN.
I MEAN IT
