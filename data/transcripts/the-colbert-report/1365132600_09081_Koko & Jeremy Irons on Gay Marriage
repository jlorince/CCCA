BECAUSE REMEMBER: THOSE WHO DO
NOT LEARN FROM HISTORY, ARE
DOOMED TO PROSPERITY.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, I'M AS AGAINST GAY
MARRIAGE AS THE NEXT GUY.
UNLESS THE NEXT GUY IS GAY.
IN WHICH CASE, STAND A LITTLE
FURTHER AWAY, NEXT GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN I'M FLATTERED BUT PLEASE.
BUT EVEN I'M GETTING TIRED OF
EVERYONE HAVING AN OPINION ABOUT
GAY MARRIAGE.
EVEN KOKO THE SIGN LANGUAGE
GORILLA WEIGHED IN.
JIM?
>> NO MAN-MAN GIVE RING.
[LAUGHTER]
CHANGE TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF
MARRIAGE, KOKO SAD.
[LAUGHTER]
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS, GAY
PEOPLE.
KOKO SAD.
[LAUGHTER]
FORTUNATELY, IN THIS BATTLE, ONE
RICH VOICE HAS RISEN ABOVE THE
NOISE.
ACADEMY AWARD WINNING ACTOR
JEREMY IRONS, WHO, IN AN
INTERVIEW WITH THE HUFFINGGAY
POST, MADE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST
GAY MARRIAGE THAT I HAVE NEVER
HEARD BEFORE.
>> I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S A
VERY INTERESTING ONE THAT, AND I
DON'T REALLY HAVE A STRONG
FEELING BUT I WORRY THAT IT
MEANS SOMEHOW WE DEBASE OR WE
CHANGE WHAT MARRIAGE IS, I JUST
WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I MEAN TAX-WISE IS AN INTERSTING
ONE, BECAUSE YOU SEE, COULD A
FATHER NOT MARRY HIS SON?
>> WELL THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST
INCEST.
>> BUT MEN DON'T BREED THEREFORE
INCEST WOULDN'T COVER THAT.
IF THAT WAS SO, AND IF I WANTED
TO PASS ON MY ESTATE WITHOUT
DEATH DUTIES, I COULD MARRY MY
SON AND PASS ON MY ESTATE TO
HIM.
I, I DON'T HAVE A STRONG FEELING
EITHER WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SO IF GAY MARRIAGE
IS LEGALIZED IN ENGLAND
JEREMY IRONS'S SON MAX -- GET
READY TO MAKE YOUR FATHER THE
HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AFTER ALL, YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER
27 YEARS -- IT'S TIME TO PUT A
RING ON IT.
[LAUGHTER]
NATURALLY, JEREMY IRONS SAYING
GAY MARRIAGE COULD LEAD TO
FATHER-SON MARRIAGE HAS RUFFLED
SOME FEATHER BOAS IN THE LIBERAL
MEDIA.
I SAY, ANYONE WHO WAS OFFENDED
OBVIOUSLY DID NOT WATCH THE
INTERVIEW TO THE END.
>> I WISH EVERYBODY WHO'S LIVING
WITH ONE OTHER PERSON THE BEST
OF LUCK IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE
IT'S FANTASTIC.
>> SPOKEN LIKE A HAPPILY MARRIED
MAN.
>> YEAH AND EVEN A MAN WITH A
DOG THAT HE LOVES.
I MEAN, LIVING WITH ANOTHER
ANIMAL, WHETHER IT BE A HUSBAND
OR A DOG, IS GREAT.
IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE SOMEONE TO
LOVE.
I DON'T THINK SEX MATTERS AT
ALL.
WHAT IT'S CALLED DOESN'T MATTER
AT ALL.
>> Stephen: SEE?
HE'S COOL WITH WHATEVER.
[LAUGHTER]
A SEXLESS MARRIAGE TO A WIFE, A
SEX-FILLED MARRIAGE TO A DOG --
THEY'RE ALL EQUALLY FANTASTIC.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NONE OF HIS COMMENTS ARE
OFFENSIVE, BECAUSE AS HE SAYS
AGAIN --
>> I DON'T HAVE A STRONG FEELING
EITHER WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: EXACTLY!
IF YOU SAY YOU DON'T HAVE STRONG
FEELINGS ABOUT AN ISSUE AT THE
BEGINNING, AND YOU WISH
EVERYBODY WELL AT THE END,
ANYTHING YOU SAY IN BETWEEN
ISN'T OFFENSIVE.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE, I DON'T
HAVE STRONG FEELINGS EITHER WAY
ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
BECAUSE YOU SEE, WOULD WE
CLASSIFY MEXICANS AS FULL HUMAN
BEINGS?
[LAUGHTER]
OR MORE AS LIVESTOCK?
BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT TRUFFLE-HUNTING PIGS ARE
BASICALLY HAARVESTING, WHICH IS
WHAT ILLEGALS DO.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I DON'T HAVE STRONG FEELINGS
EITHER WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU WANT TO BREED MEXICANS ON
YOUR FARM, FANTASTIC.
DRESS THEM AS LITTLE SAILORS --
THAT'D BE FUN!
BRAVO!
LOVE LAUGH.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
ABOUT THE SO-CALLED FAIR PAY
ACT.
I JUST WORRY THAT IF WE GIVE
WOMEN EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK,
DOES IT UNDERMINE WHAT IT MEANS
TO HAVE A JOB?
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT'S TO STOP A MAN FROM
DRESSING UP AS A WOMAN TO GET
THE EQUAL PAY?
[LAUGHTER]
ALSO, INSURANCE-WISE, IT'S A
NIGHTMARE.
WON'T THEIR MENSES ATTRACT
WOLVES?
[LAUGHTER]
I'M AN ABSOLUTE --
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST, NO
MATTER WHO'S RUNNING YOUR
COMPANY.
WHETHER IT'S A WOMAN OR A DOG,
IT'S SUPERB!
SO THANK YOU, JEREMY IRONS, AND
DON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT THE
ISSUES.
OR DO.
I DON'T HAVE A STRONG FEELING
ABOUT IT EITHER WAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
