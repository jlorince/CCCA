MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUST TONIGHT IS THE WRITER OF
THE NEW MOVIE ABOUT THE CREATION
OF FACEBOOK, "THE SOCIAL
NETWORK."
>> IT'S RAINING.
>> I'M SORRY.
>> IT JUST STARTED RAINING.
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, DO I HAVE
YOUR FULL ATTENTION?
>> NO.
>> DO YOU THINK I DESERVE IT?
>> WHAT?
>> DO YOU THINK I DESERVE YOUR
FULL ATTENTION?
>> I HAD TO SWEAR AN OATH AT THE
BEGINNING OF THIS DEPOSITION,
AND I DON'T WANT TO PERJURE
MYSELF, SO I HAVE A LEGAL
OBLIGATION TO SAY NO.
>> YOU DON'T THINK I DESERVE
YOUR FULL ATTENTION?
>> THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT I
ENJOY SITTING HERE LISTEN TO
PEOPLE LIE.
THE REST OF MY ATTENTION IS BACK
AT THE OFFICES OF FACEBOOK WHERE
MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE DOING
THINGS THAT YOUR CLIENTSES
AREN'T INTELLECTUALLY OR CAPABLE
OF DOING.
DID THAT ANSWER YOUR CON THAT
SENDING QUESTION?
>> Stephen: HERE TO ANSWER MY
CONTINUE SENDING QUESTION, AARON
SORKIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY MR. SORKIN, THANKS SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
WE'VE MET ONCE BEFORE BACK IN
THE PATH IN OUR HOLLYWOOD DAYS.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO FINALLY TALK
TO YOU.
I LOVED THE "WEST WING."
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: IT WAS MY FAVORITE
SCIENCE FICTION SHOW ABOUT AN
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WASHINGTON
WHERE A LIBERAL PRESIDENT GETS
THINGS DONE AND EVERYONE IS
WITTY AND ATTRACTIVE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THIS NEW MOVIE,
"THE SOCIAL NETWORK," ABOUT THE
CREATION OF FACEBOOK.
FICTION OR FACT?
>> FICTION.
I'M SORRY FACT.
>> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
I CAUGHT YOU RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING BY.
>> IT IS ABSOLUTE NON-FICTION.
NON-FICTION.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS TWO SEPARATE
LAWSUITS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST
FACEBOOK AT ROUGHLY THE SAME
TIME.
FACEBOOK, IF ANYBODY DOESN'T
KNOW, WAS FOUNDED BY MARK
ZUCKBERG WHEN HE WAS 19 YEARS
OLD.
TWO SEPARATE LAWSUITS WERE
BROUGHT AGAINST FADES BOOK AT
ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME.
THE PLAINTIFF, THE DEFENDANT,
THE WITNESSES, THEY ALL CAME
INTO THE DEPOSITION ROOMS AND
SWORE UNDER OATH.
WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH WERE THREE
VERY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE
STORY.
>> Stephen: AND YOU TELL THEM.
>> I DO.
INSTEAD OF PICKING ONE AND
TELLING THE SEXIEST, I LIKED
THAT THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT
VERSIONS, SO I DO IT.
>> YEAH, ARE THEY GOING TO SUE
YOU?
>> ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT TELL ME
WHAT THE ANSWER IS?
BECAUSE I LOVE TELLING MY
AUDIENCE WHAT THE ANSWER IS.
WHY MAKE US DO THE WORK IN THE
THEATER?
>> YEAH, WELL, FOR ONE THING, WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS.
>> Stephen: JUST MAKE IT UP.
>> YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IT'S ALSO
MORE FUN BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE
GOT TO DECIDE WHO IS RIGHT, WHO
IS WRONG, WHO IS GOOD, WHO IS
BAD.
WE WANT TO START FIGHTS IN THE
PARKING LOT.
>> Stephen: THIS ZUCKERBERG
GUY MIGHT COME AFTER YOU BECAUSE
YOU PORTRAY HIM AS SOMETHING OF
A GENIUS-JERK.
>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE HEY
MAKER.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT A BUILDING FEW
OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO HACK
ON THE MY HARD DRIVE AND PUT
CHILD PORN THERE.
OKAY.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: A LITTLE
PREEMPTIVE DENIAL IS WHAT I'M
HEARING.
VERY WISE, VERY WISE, MY FRIEND.
[LAUGHTER]
SO THE MOVIE IS ABOUT FACEBOOK.
I SAW IT LAST WEEK.
FANTASTIC.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: IT'S GOT THAT AR
ROAR SORKIN SUPER CRISP, WITTY
BANTER BACK AND FORTH.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
THE LADIES?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE THE
OPENING SCENE, ZUCKERBERG AND
HIS GIRLFRIEND, THE ONE WHO
BROKE HIS HEART.
>> THE GIRL WHO WOULD START
FACEBOOK.
>> Stephen: SHE IS SUPER
SMART.
SHE DEFINITELY GETS THE BEST OF
HIM.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THE OTHER LADIES
IN THE MOVIE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
TO SAY BECAUSE THEY'RE HIGH OR
DRUNK OR [BLEEPED] GUYS IN THE
BATHROOM.
WHY ARE THERE NO OTHER WOMEN OF
ANY SUBSTANCE IN THE MOVIE?
>> THAT'S FAIR QUESTION.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> THERE IS ONE OTHER WOMAN,
JONES, A YOUNG LAWYER.
>> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE.
SHE'S NOT IN THE BATHROOM.
>> SHE'S A TRUST TRUSTWORTHY
CHARACTER.
THE OTHER WOMEN ARE PRIZES
BASICALLY THAT YOU...
>> Stephen: ARE WOMEN AT
HARVARD LIKE THAT?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER
I REALLY MISSED OUT ON COLLEGE.
I WASN'T ACCEPTED INTO HARVARD
SO I WOULDN'T KNOW.
>> Stephen: DID YOU TRY TO GET
INTO HARVARD?
DID YOU APPLY THE HARVARD?
>> IF I ANSWER THAT QUESTION
HONESTLY, IT'S GOING TO BE
EMBARRASSING?
SHOULD I GO AHEAD.
MY COLLEGE DEGREE IS IN MUSICAL
THEATER, OKAY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
THAT'S A DEGREE THAT HARVARD
DOESN'T OFFER.
SO I HAD TO ONLY APPLY TO
SCHOOLS THAT HAD MUSICAL THEATER
PROGRAMS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU HAVE FAVORITE MUSICAL?
>> I HAVE A LOT OF FAVORITE
MUSICALS.
♪ A HAT
HAT THROUGH A WINDOW ♪♪
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
COME ON.
YOU CAN PLAY GEORGE.
YOU COULD PLAY GEORGE.
>> NO, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
IMPRESSIVE WHAT HE JUST DID WAS.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THAT WAS MY MANDY.
YOU DIDN'T GET INTO HARVARD,
RIGHT?
SO IS THIS REVENGE AGAINST
PEOPLE WHO DID GET INTO HARVARD?
>> IT'S NOT REVENGE, BUT THE
WOMEN IN THIS PARTICULAR STORY
WHO ARE PRIZE, IT DOESN'T SPEAK
TO THE ENTIRE FEMALE POPULATION
OF HARVARD.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE POPULATING
THIS STORY.
>> Stephen: THEN I'M SORRY,
BUT THE MOVIE MOVES TO PALO
ALTO.
>> CRAZY.
>> Stephen: THEN THERE ARE
TECH GROUP PIS THERE.
ARE YOU ON THE FACEBOOK?
>> NOPE.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT.
YOU GOT TO BE ON FACEBOOK AND
TWITTER SO THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE.
I TWEET THEREFORE I AM.
>> YES.
NO.
I'M NOT.
AND I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
YOU'RE ON FACEBOOK OR NOT, LOVE
FACEBOOK OR HATE FACEBOOK,
THAT'S IRRELEVANT TO WHETHER OR
NOT YOUEN JOY THIS.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE 500
MILLION PEOPLE.
>> IF IT WERE A COUNTRY, IT
WOULD BE THE THIRD MOST
POPULOUS.
>> Stephen: FACEBOOK IS A WAY
TO SHARE YOURSELF WITH OTHER
PEOPLE.
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO
SHARE.
AND WHEN I DO, I, YOU KNOW, I'LL
CALL SOMEBODY AND SAY I HAD A
GOOD CUPCAKE TODAY.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU CALLED
FACEBOOK A PERFORMANCE, NOT A
REALITY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
>> WHAT I MEAN IS WHEN SOMEBODY
GOES ON AND SAYS, HAD A GIRL'S
NIGHT TONIGHT, BETTER HIT THE
GYM TOMORROW.
THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO IS TRYING TO
REINVENT THEMSELVES.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU READING MY
FACEBOOK PAGE?
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S NOT
REAL?
>> THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO IS TRYING
TO REINVENT THEMSELVES AS ALLY
McBEAL.
I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR...
>> Stephen: ARE YOU UPSET YOU
DIDN'T WRITE THAT SHOW?
>> YOU DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE WITH
ME ON THIS POINT TO ENJOY THE
MOVIE.
>> Stephen: THE MOVIE IS
FANTASTIC.
I SAW IT LAST WEEK BECAUSE I'M A
SUPER SPECIAL PERSON.
THEY GAVE IT TO ME AHEAD OF
TIME.
>> WE HAD SOMEONE OUTSIDE YOUR
HOUSE THE ENTIRE TIME.
>> Stephen: BUT EVERYBODY
INVENTS THEMSELVES.
WHO AM I?
WHO ARE YOU?
YOU'RE A DRAWMTIST.
WE ALL WEAR MASK, AARON.
>> I WOULD LOVE FOR EVERYBODY TO
THINK THAT I'M AS QUICK AND
SHARP AND CHARMING AS MARTIN
SHEEN ON THE WEST WING, AND NOW
EVERYBODY GETS TO DO THAT, BUT I
DO THINK SOCIALIZING ON THE
INTERNET IS TO SOCIALIZING WHAT
REALITY TV IS TO REALITY.
>> Stephen: WE'RE NOT GOING TO
GET ANY DEEPER THAN THAT.
>> YOU'RE PEEKING.
YOU'RE PEEKING.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO
EXPLAIN TO ME IF THE SOUND IN
THE AUDIENCE WAS AGREEMENT.
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AARON SORKIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen:
