>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, YEAH, I GOTCHA.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE AS EXCITED AS I
AM BECAUSE, NATION, THE 2012
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS
HEATING UP FASTER THAN A SLICE
OF GODFATHER'S PIZZA.
[LAUGHTER]
MOSTLY BECAUSE FORMER
GODFATHER'S C.E.O. HERMAN CAIN
HAS FIRED UP HIS LIBERAL BURNING
OVEN.
THEY LOVE HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,
BUT IOWA REPUBLICANS HAVE EYES
ON CAIN, TOO, AND NOT JUST
BECAUSE BEFORE THEY RECOGNIZED
HIM THEY WERE ABOUT TO CALL
SECURITY.
[LAUGHTER]
YESTERDAY... YESTERDAY CAIN
WOWED AN IOWA CROWD BY CALLING
OBAMA CARE A DRAIN ON OUR
NATION'S RESOURCES AND ON OUR
PRINTER TO TONER.
JIM?
>> DON'T TRY TO PASS A
2,700-PAGE BILL.
AND EVEN THEY DIDN'T READ IT.
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO ONLY
ALLOW SMALL BILLS.
THREE PAGES.
>> Stephen: YEAH, THREE PAGES.
WHY DID OVERHAULING A $2.5
TRILLION INDUSTRY AND ENSURING
THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS
TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE HAVE
TO BE SO COMPLICATED?
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.
OH, AND INCIDENTALLY, ROCKET
SCIENTISTS, YOUR PROPOSAL FOR
THE MARS MISSION, KEEP IT SHORT.
[LAUGHTER]
MOSTLY PICTURES.
AND FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO
HEALTH CARE, I SAY WE SHOULD
LISTEN TO THE MAN WHO MADE HIS
FORTUNE SELLING BACON
CHEESEBURGER PIZZA.
AMERICANS DON'T HAVE TIME TO
READ COMPLEX LEGISLATION.
THEY'RE TOO BUSY GETTING THEIR
HEARTS RESTARTED.
PRESIDENT CAIN WILL NOT TOLERATE
LEGISLATION LONGER THAN A PIZZA
MENU.
PLUS EVERY BUDGET ITEM WILL COME
WITH SOUP, SALAD AND UNLIMIT
BREADSTICKS.
THE POINT IS, THE PILOT IS
ANYTHING OVER THREE PAGES IS TOO
LONG FOR OUR ATTENTION SPANS.
I THINK I -- OH, I'M GOING TO
GET YOU.
I'M GOING TO GET YOU.
COME ON.
GET OVER HERE.
COME ON.
[LAUGHTER]
WHERE WAS I?
RIGHT.
OKAY.
NO BILL WORTH PASSING SHOULD BE
MORE THAN THREE PAGES.
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, U.S.
CONSTITUTION.
[LAUGHTER]
FOUR PAGES?
HEY, FOUNDING FATHERS, ESTABLISH
A MORE PERFECT UNION OR GET OFF
THE POT.
AND HERMAN CAIN CANE AND I ARE
BOTH NO FANS OF SLAVERY, BUT THE
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WAS
FIVE PAGES.
HOW MUCH INK DOES IT TAKE TO
SAY, "YOU'RE FREE NOW.
WE'LL FIX SEGREGATION LATER?
" AND FOLKS, IF SHORT IS GOOD,
SHORTER IS BETTER.
SO IF ANYONE WANTS MY VOTE, THEY
MUST PLEDGE TO REPEAL AND
REPLACE OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE BILL
WITH THIS REPUBLICAN HEALTH PLAN
HAIKU.
[LAUGHTER]
BLOOD IN THE URINE.
A TINGLING DOWN THE LEFT ARM.
WALK IT OFF,
