AND THE CHALLENGES BECAUSEWE PUT SO MANY PEOPLE IN
PRISON, IMPOSE HARSHCHALLENGES.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THECHALLENGE.
WE HAVE MASS INCARCERATIONTHAT WAS OUR GOAL AND NOW WE
HAVE A CHIEFED IT.
>> WE'VE ALSO REALLYDEVASTATED COMMUNITIES OF
COLOR, POOR COMMUNITIES.
WE CREATED DESPAIR ANDHOPELESSNESS.
WE'VE SPPBT A LOT OF MONEY.
WE'RE NOW SPENDING $80BILLION A YEAR TO KEEP
PEOPLE IN JAILS AND PRISONS.
WE CREATE A LOT OF BADCOLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES.
PEOPLE LOSE THEIR RIGHT TOVOTE PERMANENTLY.
>> Stephen: PRISONS HAVEGOTTEN BETTER, YOU HAVE TO
ADMIT THAT PRISONS HAVEGOTTEN BETTER IN THE LAST 20
YEARS BECAUSE 20 YEARS AGOTHEY WEREN'T TURNING A
PROFIT.
AND NOW THEY ARE, THOSE BEDSARE FULL.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY THEY'RETURNING A PROFIT FOR A
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BUT THEYARE GETTING THAT PROFIT BY
TAKING MONEY FROM EDUCATIONAND TAKING MONEY FROM HUMAN
SERVICES AND TAKING MONEYFROM THE NEEDS OF THE
ELDERLY.
AND BASIC TAXPAYERS.
THEY'VE GOTTEN ACTUALLYWORSE.
WE'RE NOW OVERCROWD.
WE'RE NOW TOLERATINGABECAUSE AND RAPE AND
DYSFUNCTION.
AND ACTUALLY THE CONDITIONSOF CONFINEMENT IN THIS
COUNTRY HAVE NEVER BEENWORSE.

GIVE ME THE DISPROPORTION.
WHAT DOW MEAN.
>> THE BUREAU JUSTICESUPPORTED THAT ONE IN 15
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY CANEXPECT TO GO TO JAIL OR
PRISON.
BUT ONE IN 3 BLACK MALES CANEXPECT TO GO TO JAIL OR
PRISON.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE POLICIESTHAT ARE DIRECTED AT
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, POORCOMMUNITIES, DRUG LAWS THAT
WE ENFORCE SELECTIVELYAGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR.
AND-- .
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING WESHOULD NOT ENFORCE OUR DRUG
LAWS.
BE SOFT ON CRIME, THAT ISWHAT I AM HEARING.
>> I'M SAYING WE SHOULDENFORCE THEM FAIRLY.
WE SHOULDN'T ONLY ENFORCETHEM AGAINST THE POOR AND
MINORITIES.
BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THAT WEARE ACTUALLY CREATING A
SYSTEM THAT IS RACIALLYBIASED.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BUT LISTEN,THAT IS IF YOU BELIEVE THAT
RACE MATTERS, OKAY.
I DON'T SEE RACE.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT A RACIST.
I'VE MOVED BEYOND IT YOUKNOW, YOU ARE,, PEOPLE
ALWAYS TELL ME YOU'RE BLACK.
ARE YOU A BLACK MAN.
>> I AM A BLACK MAN.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN TOPRISON.
>> I HAVE BEEN IN A PRISON.
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEENSENTENCED TO PRISON.
>> Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW IFYOU ARE ACTUALLY BLACK OR
NOT.

DO HAVE THIS LEGACY THATSUGGESTS THAT RACE DOES
MATTER.
AND YOU CAN SEE-- .
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD ITMATTER?
>> WELL, IT MATTER BECAUSEWE FIRST ENSLAVED PEOPLE IN
THIS COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW,DON'T RUB IT IN, MAN.
(LAUGHTER)>> AND WE DIDN'T END
SLAVERY.
WE TRANSITIONED FROM SLAVERYTO 100 YEARS OF TERRORISM.
AND THAT TERRORISM-- .
>> Stephen: WHAT DOW MEAN.
>> WELL, IT MEANS THATACTUALLY FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICANS THE 100YEARS FOLLOWING SLAVERY WERE
DEFINED BY RACIAL TERROR.
THEY HAD TO WORRY ABOUTLYNCHING, HATE CRIMES, THEY
TO WORRY ABOUT VIOLENCE ANDINTIMIDATION AND THAT WAS
FOLLOWED BY DECADES OFSEGREGATION AND
INSUBORDINATION ANDHUMILIATION WHICH IS WHAT
JIM CROW LAWS DID.
>> Stephen: SO CAN I BLAMETHIS ON MUSLIMS?
>> NO.
YOU ACTUALLY, WE ARE ALLACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR
FAILURE TO TELL THE TRUTHABOUT OUR RACIAL HISTORY.
>> Stephen: SO YOU TOO, YOUARE A BLACK GUY, RIGHT.
>> EVERYBODY.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE TELL MEI'M WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM
BECAUSE I FEEL TERRIBLYGUILTY ABOUT THIS
CONVERSATION.
SO BLACK PEOPLE HAVE SOMEBURDEN IN THIS.
>> WELL, YES, BECAUSE WEACTUALLY HAVE TO GET THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY, BLACKS,WHITE, LATINO, RELIGIOUS
MINORITIES, EVERYBODY TO BEMORE TRUTHFUL ABOUT WHAT
DISCRIMINATION AND BIGOTRYDOES TO US ALL.

WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.
WHAT PART OF WE HAVE A BLACKPRESIDENT DON'T YOU GET.
>> WELL, I GET THAT WE HAVEA BLACK PRESIDENT.
IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE ABLACK PRESIDENT THAT'S
ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED TO TALKABOUT RACE BECAUSE HE IS A
BLACK PRESIDENT.
WHICH SPEAKS TO THIS DYNAMICOF HOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
OUR PAST MORE TRUTHFULLYWITH A COMMITMENT TO
RECONCILIATION.
AND WE'RE SEEING IT PLAYITSELF OUT NOW.
TOO MANY KIDS OF COLOR AREPRESUMED GUILTY.
THEY WALK AROUND, THEY AREASSUMED TO HAR WAS,.
>> Stephen: SOME YOUNG BLACKMEN DO COMMIT CRIMES.
>> NO QUESTION.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T ITLOGICALLY FOLLOW THAT ALL OF
THEM DO?

CRIMES AND YOUNG WHITE GIRLSCOMMIT CRIME AND OLDER WHITE
MEN COMMIT CRIMES ANDREPUBLICANS COMMIT CRIMES.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO COLLEGESAND UNIVERSITIES DOING DRUG
RAID, WE'RE GO TOGETHERPROJECTS, THE POOREST AND
MOST DESPERATE AREAS, THATIS WHERE WE DO MASS ARRESTS.
>> Stephen: I GOT A LOT OFVIEWERS IN COLLEGE DORM
ROOMS RIGHT NOW.

THEM.

COMMUNITIES AND URBANCOMMUNITIES AND RURAL
COMMUNITIES, WHERE THERE HASBEEN GENERATIONAL POVERTY,
MY CLIENT, THE KIDS I WORKWITH, 13, 14, FELL ME THAT
THEY DON'T EXPECT TO GETPAST THE AGE OF 21 WITHOUT
BEING ARRESTED ANINCARCERATED.

WHY THEN DOW LIVE IN ALABAMA?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'SLIKE DOWN THERE, RIGHT?
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE SOMEPLACEWHERE THERE IS NO RACISM
LIKE CHICAGO OR BOSTON.

ALABAMA AND SOUTH CAROLINAAND DEEP SOUTH WE CAN MAKE
RACIAL PROGRESS EVERYWHERE.
