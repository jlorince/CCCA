OH... THERE IT IS.
(LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, THOSE GIRLS ARE WINNERS!
TINY, FRIGHTENINGLY STRONG WINNERS.
(LAUGHTER) AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS A WINNER, SNOX THE U.S.S.
"INTREPID." BUILT IN 1943 THIS BRAVE LADY HELPED US WIN WORLD WAR II, THE
KOREAN WAR AND VIETNAM.
OH, PEOPLE SAY WE LOST, BUT SHE'S JUST WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO GO BACK AND KICK SOME ASS.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS MONTH THE "INTREPID" CELEBRATES ITS 30th YEAR AS A
NAVAL MUSEUM DOCKED ON THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY AND, LIKE MANY VEHICLES ON THAT ROAD, IT HASN'T
MOVED AN INCH IN THREE DECADES.
(LAUGHTER) IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE ABOARD THIS BROAD VESSEL ALL WEEK AND RECENTLY I LEARNED A
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HER.
NAVAL SHIPS AND NEW YORK CITY,
THEY GO TOGETHER LIKE PENICILLIN ♪ NEW YORK, NEW YORK, A WONDERFUL TOWN ♪
SO AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER WAS A WONDERFUL CHOICE TO HOST COLBCHELLA.
I MET WITH HISTOR JANUARY AND CURATOR JESSICA WILLIAMS.
THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME.
>> NO PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: I NOTICE YOU ARE PREGNANT.
>> I AM.
YUP.
>> Stephen: AT ANY POINT IN THIS INTERVIEW YOU FEEL CONTRACTIONS
LET ME KNOW AND I WILL LEAVE." (LAUGHTER)
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
IS IT TOUGH BEING A WOMAN SERVING ON A MUSEUM.
>> IN THE PAST WHEN "INTREPID" WAS IN SERVICE, THERE WERE NO WOMEN ABOARD.
(SHIP HORN HONKS)
>> Stephen: THAT'S MY RIDE.
I'VE GOT MAKE THIS QUICK.
WHY IS THE "INTREPID" LOCATED HERE ON THE HUDSON RIVER ON MANHATTAN'S WEST SIDE?
I ASSUME THAT'S TO PROTECT US FROM THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY?
>> NO.
(SHIP HORN HONKS)
>> Stephen: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT SHIP-RELATED QUESTION FOR YOU.
THE "INTREPID" OVER 41,000 TONS.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: IT'S SOLID STEEL AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES IT FLOAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE BUOYANCY OF THE SHIP IS BASED ON THE VOLUME OF THE SHIP AND HOW... (SHIP HORN HONKING)
ALL RIGHT, IT'S....
>> Stephen: I WILL BE RIGHT THERE!
(LAUGHTER) WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH THE AIRPLANES WHEN THE "INTREPID" WOULD SUBMERGE?
DO THEY STRAP THEM TO THE DECK SO THEY WOULDN'T FLOAT OFF WHEN
THE "INTREPID" WAS UNDERWATER?
>> WELL THE "INTREPID" DOESN'T GO UNDERWATER.
>> Stephen: IT USED TO.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S DECOMMISSIONED BUT IT USED TO GO UNDERWATER WHEN THE JAPANESE WERE HUNTING IT.
>> IT'S NOT A SUBMARINE.
WE DO HAVE ONE....
>> Stephen: OH, I KNOW THERE'S A SUBMARINE THAT'S AN AIRCRAFT
CARRIER THAT RARELY WENT UNDERWATER.
I'M SURE RARELY.
>> NEVER WENT UNDERWATER.
>> Stephen: LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE.
YOU HAVE YOUR OPINION; I HAVE MINE.
THEY'RE BOTH VALID.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: CLEARLY THE U.S.S.
"INTREPID" HAS A STORIED HISTORY BUT CAN WE BOTH AGREE THAT PEPSI
PRESENTS: STEPHEST COLBCHELLA '012: ROCKTAUGUSTFEST WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED ON CHECK?
>> WELL, MAYBE AN IMPORTANT THING.
>> Stephen: NAME ONE THING MORE IMPORTANT THAT HAPPENED ON THE "INTREPID".
>> ANY NUMBER OF KAMIKAZE ATTACKS DURING WORLD WAR II, FOR EXAMPLE.
BUT I THINK THE CONCERT WILL BE MORE FUN.
>> Stephen: THE CONCERT WILL BE MORE FUN THAN A KAMIKAZE ATTACK.
THAT'S A GREAT TAG LINE FOR THE SHOW.
"MORE FUN THAN A KAMIKAZE ATTACK." EXCELLENT.
WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SHIP.
>> GREAT.
OH, OKAY.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: FOR THE FIRST PART OF MY TOUR I MET WITH SHIP HISTORIAN AND CURATOR JESSICA WILLIAMS.
HI, STEVE COLBERT, NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING.
>> Stephen: I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THIS IS WORLD WAR II.
>> EXACTLY, YES.
>> Stephen: AND THE BOAT WAS SO SMALL THEN BECAUSE THE JAPANESE WERE VERY TINY?
>> NO, NO, THE BOAT WAS A FULL SIZE OF A BOAT THAT WE'RE WALKING IN RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS JUST A MODEL.
>> Stephen: OH, JUST A TINY ONE.
MY MISTAKE.
I JUST THOUGHT... THAT'S NOT RACIST.
THAT'S JUST... THAT'S RACIAL.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
>> THIS IS ANOTHER MODEL OF THE SHIP MADE OUT OF LEGOS.
ABOUT A QUARTER MILLION LEGO PIECES.
>> Stephen: INCREDIBLE.
HOW MANY LEGOS DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE THE ACTUAL SHIP?
(LAUGHTER) AT THIS POINT, JESSICA WENT INTO LABOR SO I FINISHED MY TOUR WITH A TRUE VETERAN OF THE "INTREPID".
HI.
>> HOW YOU DOING THERE?
>> STEVEN COLBERT.
>> ROBERT DELEO.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE DEAL OWE?
YOU SERVED ON THE "INTREPID"?
>> YES, I SERVED ON THE SHIP IN THE SPRING OF 1956.
>> FIGHTING THE JAPANESE.
>> NO WAY!
THAT WAS THE COLD WAR.
>> Stephen: COLD WAR.
I DON'T THINK WE FOUGHT THE JAPANESE IN THE COLD WAR.
>> NO, EISENHOWER.
>> Stephen: I REMEMBER HIM.
>> YOU DON'T REMEMBER HIM WELL.
HE SAID "WE'VE GOT TO SEND SOME GUYS OVER TO LEBANON."
>> Stephen: I HAD NO IDEA THE JAPANESE WERE IN LEBANON.
>> THE JAPANESE WERE NOT IN LEBANON.
>> Stephen: WHERE WERE SAY IN
>> I DON'T KNOW, THEY WERE HOME MAKING TOYS.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
>> RIGHT HERE WE HAVE THE F-14.
IT'S THE TOMCAT.
>> Stephen: I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS, MARINO.
TOMCAT HAS BROKEN UP.
SO WE'VE GOT ONE OF THE BLUE ANGELS RIGHT HERE.
>> YES, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: I LOVE THE BLUE ANGELS.
>> WELL, THEY'RE NICE.
>> Stephen: CAN'T TOUCH THE PLANES, MARINO, CAN'T TOUCH THE PLANES.
THEY CAN GO TO WAR BUT THEY CAN'T TAKEN A OLD MAN TOUCHING THEM.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW THIS GUY, LIEUTENANT?
>> Stephen: LOU AND I PLAYED SQUASH TOGETHER.
WHO'S LOU CHAPMAN?
>> HE'S A LIEUTENANT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU KNOW HIM?
>> HE'S LONG GONE.
>> Stephen: DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM WHEN I ASKED ME IF I KNEW HIM?
>> NO, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU DID KNOW HIM.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU TESTING HE?
>> HOW DID I DO.
>> Stephen: YOU DID FINE.
>> Stephen: AM I IN THE NAVY NOW?
IS THIS PART OF THE TOP GUN TRAINING?
THIS ONE, IT CAN FIRE MISSILE.
>> ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS,
THERE'S A GATLING GUN RIGHT HERE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THE THING THAT REALLY SCARED THE ENEMY WOULD BE THE CARTOON SHARK TEETH?
>> OH, THAT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF THEM.
>> Stephen: WOULD THE VIETCONG LOOK UP AND GO "WHY IS THAT SHARK FLYING?"
(LAUGHTER) NOW, MARINE KNOW, THE "INTREPID" HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS SIZE?
>> THE "INTREPID" HAS CHANGED FROM THIS SIZE.
>> Stephen: I SAW THE MODEL DOWN STAIRS, IT WAS VERY SMALL.
>> THERE'S ONE THAT'S TO SCALE,
I THINK IT'S 1/40th.
>> Stephen: I LIKE THE 1-1 SCALE.
THIS IS HOW BIG IT WAS.
MARIE KNOW, AS A VETERAN WHO SERVED ON THE "INTREPID" I'M
REQUESTING PERMISSION TO ROCK THE BOAT.
>> PERMISSION GRANTED.
(HORN HONKS)
>> Stephen: AND ROCK IT WE DID!
