(APPLAUSE) MAYBE... I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE BAD HUMMUS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT OBAMAï¿½rï¿½ IS LEAK.
THE MAN IS DESPERATE FOR ANY GOOD NEWS BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT
HE CAN'T RUN ON THE ECONOMY.
THOUGH HE TRIES.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS HUGE GAFFE HE MADE ON FRIDAY.
>> WE'VE CREATED 4.3 MILLION JOBS OVER THE LAST TWO... 27 MONTHS.
OVER 800,000 JUST THIS YEAR ALONE.
THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING FINE.
>> Stephen: DOING FINE?
TELL THAT TO THE 20 STAFFERS I JUST FIRED TO MAKE OBAMA LOOK BAD!
(LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, GUYS, I'VE GOT TO TALK TO A FEW OF YOU AFTER THE SHOW TONIGHT.
NOT THE CAMERAS OR HAIR.
(LAUGHTER) AND IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR MITT TO JUMP ALL OVER THIS BLUNDER.
>> HE SAID THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING FINE!
IS HE REALLY THAT OUT OF TOUCH?
I THINK HE'S DEFINING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DETACHED AND OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WELL SAID.
OBAMA IS TOTALLY OUT OF TOUCH.
ROMNEY THEN FLEW OFF IN HIS PRIVATE JET TO WATCH RAFALCA COMPETE IN THE NATIONAL DRESSAGE CHAMPIONSHIP.
IS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) THIS IS ALWAYS DOWN THERE.
(LAUGHTER) AND ROMNEY WAS JUST GETTING LUKEWARMED UP.
>> HE SAYS WE NEED MORE FIREMEN,
MORE POLICEMEN, MORE TEACHERS.
DID HE NOT GET THE MESSAGE OF WISCONSIN?
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DID!
IT'S TIME FOR US TO CUT BACK ON GOVERNMENT AND HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
>> Stephen: YES, ONLY ROMNEY HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY WHAT WE'RE
ALL THINKING: AMERICA IS BEING SUCKED DRY BY FIREMEN, POLICEMEN AND TEACHERS!
(LAUGHTER) THESE BIG-GOVERNMENT MOOCHERS ARE SO LAZY THEY CAN'T EVEN TAKE THE STAIRS!
SOME OF THEM SLIDE DOWN POLES!
(LAUGHTER) MUST BE NICE.
THE WORST PART, FOLKS, IS OUR KIDS LOOK UP TO THESE PARASITES.
ASK ANY BRAINWASHED SIX-YEAR-OLD WHAT HE WANTS TO BE WHEN HE GROWS UP AND IT'S ALWAYS MEMBERS
OF PUBLIC SERVICE UNIONS-- FIREMEN, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS,
KIDS NEED TO STARTED A MIRING SOCIETY'S REAL HEROES: JOB CREATORS.
THAT'S WHY I AM CALLING FOR FREE MARKET AFFIRMING 7ï¿½E Qg'S BOOKS CELEBRATING THE 1%.
WHATQ ABOUT JAMES AND THE GIANT YEAR END BONUS?
(LAUGHTER) OR "GREEN EGGS AND HOWARD WEINBERG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
OF GLOBAL CURRENCY AT GOLDMAN SACHS." (LAUGHTER) HAVE YOUR KIDS READ THEM!
OR YOU MIGHT NEED TO READ THEM TO YOUR KIDS BECAUSE IF ROMNEY WINS, WE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOW
ON TEACHERS.
