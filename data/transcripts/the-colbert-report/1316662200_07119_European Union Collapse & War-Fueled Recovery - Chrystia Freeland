FINANCIAL WORRIES.
HERE TO PROVIDE SOME OTHER
ANSWERS TO AMERICA'S FINANCIAL
WORRIES, PLEASE WELCOME GLOBAL
EDITOR-AT-LARGE FOR REUTERS
KRISTIA FREEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT.
ARE THE POLISH GUYS RIGHT THAT
IF EUROPE CRUMBLES WE COULD SEE
WAR IN TEN TO 20 YEARS?
>> WAR IS PROBABLY NOT MY
BIGGEST FEAR.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
WHAT FRIGHTENS YOU MORE THAN
WAR.
YOU ARE VERY TOUGH.
>> MY BIGGEST FEAR ABOUT YIEWCH
TODAY, IT'S NOT THE MOST LIKELY
THING, BUT I THINK THIS IS A
HUGE CRISIS.
I THINK THIS IS POTENTIALLY
BIGGER THAN LEHMAN IN 2008,
BECAUSE THE DANGER ISN'T JUST
THE RUN ON THE BANKS, WHICH IS
WHAT YOU HAD IN THE U.S., IT'S A
RUN ON COUNTRIES, AND YOU COULD
HAVE THE DOMINOES FALL.
IT STARTED IN GREECE, AND NOW
IT'S MOVED TO ITALY AND SPAIN,
WHICH ARE REALLY BIG COUNTRIES.
>> Stephen: IF YOU HAVE A RUN
ON A COUNTRY, YOU CAN'T
FORECLOSE ON A COUNTRY.
>> YOU CAN'T FORECLOSE ON A
COUNTRY, BUT IF, FOR EXAMPLE,
THERE IS A DISORDERLY DEFAULT IN
GREECE AND PEOPLE... AND THE
GREEK BANKS ALL FAIL, YOU COULD
HAVE PEOPLE IN ITALY AND SPAIN
SAYING, OH, MY GOD, WE'RE GOING
TO BE NEXT, PULL ALL THEIR MONEY
OUT OF THE BANKS OF ITALY AND
SPAIN, AND YOU COULD HAVE A REAL
ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.
>> Stephen: KISSINGER ONCE
FAMOUSLY SAID, "IF I WANT TO
CALL EUROPE, WHO DO I CALL?"
WHO IS EUROPE RIGHT NOW.
>> THAT IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM.
AND UNFORTUNATELY EUROPE DOESN'T
HAVE ANYONE IN CHARGE.
EUROPE HAS A SINGLE CURRENCY BUT
I DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.
>> Stephen: GERMANY'S WANTED
TO BE IN CHARGE A COUPLE OF
TIMES.
>> BUT NOW THEY DON'T FEEL THAT
WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA, AND
THE PROBLEM IS THE REST OF THE
EUROPEANS ARE SAYING, ESPECIALLY
THE WEAK ONES, LIKE GREECE, LIKE
ITALY, LIKE SPAIN, YOU KNOW
WHAT, GERMANS, YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO BAIL US OUT IF YOU WANT
THIS HOE TO STAY ON THE ROAD.
>> Stephen: ARE THEY GOING TO
DO IT?
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK
THE GERMANS WILL.
>> Stephen: IS IT A PROBLEM
THAT RIGHT NOW IN GERMANY IT'S
OKTOBERFEST TIME?
ARE THEY GOING TO WAKE UP A
MONTH FROM NOW AND SAY WAIT, WE
BAILED OUT WHO?
>> ANGELA MERKEL DOESN'T STRIKE
ME AS PARTICULARLY AN
OKTOBERFEST TYPE OF GIRL, SO
THAT'S NOT ON MY LIST.
BUT REMEMBER HOW TRAUMATIC 2008
WAS AND HOW MUCH THE...
>> Stephen: OBAMA WON.
>> AMERICANS ON MAIN STREET
HATED BAILING OUT WALL STREET.
THE EUROPEAN PROBLEM IS EVEN
MORE EXTREME IS BECAUSE WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING REGULAR GERMANS TO
DO IS BAIL OUT BANKERS WHO
AREN'T EVEN THEIR OWN.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BAIL
OUT OTHER COUNTRY'S BANKERS.
>> Stephen: WHY SHOULD I IN
THE UNITED STATES CARE WHAT
HAPPENS TO EUROPE?
>> THERE ARE THREE BIG ECONOMIES
IN THE WORLD, U.S., EUROPE,
ASIA, WITH CHINA AND JAPAN
MOSTLY.
IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE
BIGGIES, EUROPE, GET REALLY
WEAK, AND IF YOU HAD A COLLAPSE
OF THE EURO, PEOPLE ARE TALKING
ABOUT CONTRACTION OF G.D.P. IN
SOME COUNTRIES OF 40% TO 50% IN
EUROPE, NOT 2% TO 3%, 40% TO 50%
IN THE PERIPHERAL COUNTRIES.
25% IN THE CORE ONES.
YOU WOULD SEE THE U.S. ECONOMY
SHIFT INTO A REALLY SEVERE
RECESSION.
>> Stephen: WHY DIDN'T THE
EURO WORK?
FIVE WORDS OR LESS.
>> YOU'VE SAID IT ALREADY.
IF I WANT TO CALL EUROPE, WHO DO
I CALL?
THEY HAD A SINGLE CURRENCY, A
SINGLE CENTRAL BANKER, BUT NO
SINGLE POLITICAL AUTHORITY.
IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK.
>> Stephen: THEY'RE NOT A
UNITED STATES OF EUROPE.
>> THEY ARE NOT.
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT ALL
ALONG THAT THE SECRET GERMAN
SCHEME WAS THEY WANTED TO GET TO
A UNITED STATES OF EUROPE, BUT
THAT WAS POLITICALLY
CONTROVERSIAL, SO START WITH
CURRENCY UNION AND EVENTUALLY
YOU'LL GET TO POLITICAL UNION.
THAT MAY HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE REALLY
THOUGHT THAT WAS A CONSPIRACY BY
GERMANY?
LIKE THERE ARE A BUNCH OF
GERMANS UP IN THE ALPS GOING,
"THIS TIME WE DO IT WITH
CURRENCY MANIPULATION."
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF... THERE
ARE A LOT OF POLITICAL LEADERS
WHO THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD
IDEA.
AND BECAUSE THE POLITICAL UNION
RIGHT AWAY WASN'T POSSIBLE,
CURRENCY UNION SEEMED LIKE A
GOOD FIRST STEP.
NOW, THE IRONY OF THE SITUATION
IS IN ORDER TO FIX, GET THROUGH
THE CURRENT CRISIS, I THINK THAT
WHAT IS LIKELY IS THEY'RE GOING
TO HAVE CLOSER POLITICAL UNION
OF THE CORE EURO STATES.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'LL GET
THROUGH THIS.
>> Stephen: IS ENGLAND IN THE
EURO?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IF EUROPE GOES
DOWN, IS ENGLAND ?AIFTD
>> I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE
THEIR ECONOMY IS CLOSELY TIED TO
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY.
THE CITY OF LONDON IS VERY, VERY
CLOSELY TIED TO THE EUROPEAN
ECONOMY.
A WEAK EUROPE IS BAD FOR
ENGLAND.
HAVING SAID THAT, THE BRITS, WHO
TOOK A LOT OF FLACK FOR OTHER
EUROPEANS FOR NOT JOINING THE
EURO ARE SAYING, WE TOLD YOU SO,
THIS COMMON CURRENCY WAS NOT
SUCH A GREAT IDEA.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY SAID IT
IN SUCH A CHARMING ACCENT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
>> PLEASURE.
>> Stephen:
