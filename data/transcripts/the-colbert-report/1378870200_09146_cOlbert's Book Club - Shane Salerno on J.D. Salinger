>> WHY DID YOU THROW YOURSELFINTO THE LIFE OF SALINGER?  WHY
IS HE YOUR WHITE WHALE?
>> HE WAS, THAT IS A GOOD WAY TOPUT IT.
HIS LIFE IS SO EXTRAORDINARY.
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT J.D.

18TH BIRTHDAY.

BATTLE OF THE BULGE AND READS INTHE NEWSPAPER, GUESS WHAT, YOUR
GIRLFRIEND JUST MARRIED CHARLIECHAPLAIN.

>> YEAH.
AND SHE IS 18.
>> SHE IS 18, AND THAT CHANGEDHIS LIFE FOREVER, EVERY WOMAN
WAS COMPARED TO UNA, SHE REALLYIMPRINTED UPON HIM AN AGE AND
PERIOD IN HIS LIFE.
>> Stephen: LET'S GET INTOWHAT I THINK IS REALLY THE
SHOCKER IN THE BOOK, THE THINGTHAT REALLY REVEALS SAL JERRY IN
HIS TOTALITY.
>> HE HAD ONE BALL.
THAT IS A REVELATION IN HERE.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT BEFORE IREAD YOUR BOOK.
IT IS TRUE, RIGHT?
>> IT IS ONE PARAGRAPH IN A 700PAGE BOOK.
BUT IT IS TRUE.
>> Stephen: IT IS.
ONE PARAGRAPH, ONLY ONE BALL.
>> NOW -->> Stephen: IS THAT WHY HE
WENT FOR SUCH YOUNG WOMEN, YOUNGVIRTUAL VIN NATURAL WOMEN.
>> VIRGIN NATURAL AND HE WOULDSAY, NO, NO THEY ARE ALL LIKE
THAT, THEY ARE ALL LIKE THAT.
>> .. I AM GOING TO TAKE THEFIFTH ON THAT ONE.
>> Stephen: HERE IS MY BEEF.
HERE IS MY BEEF WITH YOU.
WHY LET ME KNOW THESE THINGSABOUT SALINGER?  HE WAS SOMEONE
WHO GUARDED HIS PRIVACY AND IRESPECTED THAT PRIVACY BY NOT
INTRUDING BECAUSE WHAT IF I FINDOUT THINGS ABOUT HIM THAT CREEP
ME OUT?  I AM WORRIED IF I LEARNTHINGS ABOUT SALINGER THAT I
DON'T LIKE I WON'T LIKE HISBOOKS ANYMORE IS THAT A DANGER?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASEIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SINCE THE
PUBLICITY OF THE FILM AND THEFILM HAS BEEN RELEASED CATCHER
IN THE RYE JUMPED TO NUMBERSEVEN ON AMAZON.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINKWE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT A GUY
WHO HASN'T REALLY -- HASN'TWRITTEN ANYTHING ANYBODY THOUGHT
WAS REALLY ANY GOOD SINCE THE1950'S?
>> SALINGER IS A IS AONE-OF-A-KIND SINGULAR VOICE AND
THE IDEA HE WORKED FOR 45 YEARSEVERY SINGLE DAY AND PUT THAT
WORK IN A VAULT TO BE RELEASEDSTARTING IN 2,015.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HOPETHOSE STORY ARE?  AND WHAT DO
YOU HOPE THEY WEREN'T?
>> WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK --WILL HATE THE MOST?
>> I THINK WHAT IS GOING TO BEINCREDIBLE TO SEE HIM COMPLETE
THE GLASS FAMILY, TO SEE ANARTIST COMPLETE SOMETHING THAT
HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR 40YEAR.
WE HAVE ONLY SEEN HALF OF THEPAINTING.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR.
WE HAVE HALF OF THE PAINTING.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINKHE DIDN'T LET US SEE?  HE WAS
WRITING EVERY DAY AND THE STUFFIS REALLY OUT THERE AND I WILL
TAKE IT ON FAITH.
WHY DO YOU THINK HE WOULDN'T LETUS SEE IT.
>> HIS RELIGION SAYS YOU DON'TDO ANYTHING THAT FEEDS YOUR EGO.
>> Stephen: THAT SUCKS.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: DO YOU KNOW -- I
DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, YOU WORK IN HOLLYWOOD,SO YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT FEEDING
AN EGO IS LIKE.
BUT YOU KNOW HOW DELICIOUS IT ISTO FEED YOUR EGO?
>> BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS WHY.
I MEAN, HE REALLY FELT THAT THEWORK ITSELF WAS THE REWARD, AND
SO THAT AFTER HE PASSED AWAY AFEW YEARS IT WOULD BE EXACTLY
FIVE YEARS AFTER HE PASSES AWAYTHE WORK WILL START TO BE
RELEASE SOD HE IS NOT THERE FORTHE EGO GRATIFICATION OF SEEING
IT PUBLISHED, THAT IT IS JUST APURE ARTIST DELIVERING HIS WORK
TO AN AUDIENCE.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINKTHAT SEYMOUR SHOOTS HIMSELF?
>> BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMASUFFERED IN WORLD WAR 2 AND
SALINGER KNEW THATEXTRAORDINARILY WELL, AND
SALINGER WALKED INTO ACONCENTRATION CAMP AND NEVER
WALKED OUT AND FOR THE TEST OFHIS LIFE HE WAS LIVING IN
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROMEAND OUR FILM DETAILS THAT AND I
THINK IN AN UNPRECEDENTEDFASHION SHOWS HOW DAMAGED HE
REALLY WAS.
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUTWORLD WAR II AND SALINGER IS IF
J.D. SALINGER HADN'T GONE TOWORLD WAR II WE WOULD HAVEN'T
THIS WORK, SO, YOU KNOW,.
>> Stephen: SO MAYBE WE OWEHITLER MAYBE JUST A LITTLE
APOLOGY.
YOUR WORDS.
YOUR WORDS.
NOT MINE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Stephen: SHANE SALERNO, THE
BOOK AND A MOVIE, SALINGER.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
