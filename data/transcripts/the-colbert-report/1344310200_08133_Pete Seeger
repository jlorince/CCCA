BEHOLD HE AND HIS SON SELECTED NOT DOZENS BUT HUNDREDS OF SHORT QUOTATIONS HE FELT FROM ME, SOME
OF THE MAGAZINE ARTICLES I HAD WRITTEN AND A FEW PARAGRFS FROM BOOKS -- PARAGRAPHS FROM BOOKS
I'D WRITTEN.
PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER.

AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE,

>> ACTUALLY, HE -- AS A TEENAGER, HE BECAME SKILLED AT READING SYMPHONY SCORES AND WHEN
HE WENT TO COLLEGE GOT A PLUS IN ALL HIS MUSIC COURSES.
WENT TO DO GRADUATE WORK IN GERMANY.
FOUND HIMSELF GOING DEAF AT AN EARLY AGE BUT ALSO MET THE PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA WHO WAS IMPRESSED BY THIS SELF CONFIDENT YOUNGMAN AND NEXT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN CHARGE
OF MUSIC DEPARTMENT AT BERKLEY -- BERKLEE.
BUT HIS FELLOW PROFESSORS SAID YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT MUSIC BUT YOU ARE AN IGNORE RAMOUS WHEN IT
COMES TO HISTORY AND PRETTY SOON HE WAS A SOCIALIST.
AND HE MADE SPEECHES ABOUT IMPERIALIST WAR.
