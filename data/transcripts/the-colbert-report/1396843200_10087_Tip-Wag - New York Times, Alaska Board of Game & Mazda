IT'S THE LOVE OF ALCOHOL ANDPUBLIC URINATION.
AND I LOVE EVERY INNOVATIONIN HUNTING WHICH IS WHY I'M
GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TOTHE ALASKA BOARD OF GAME
WHICH JUST VOTED TO MAKE-- ASSISTED HUNTING
ILLEGAL BY BANNING USING ADRONE TO FLY ABOVE TREES TO
LOOK FOR A MOOSE OR A BEAR.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, GOINTO THE WOODS MYSELF.
THERE MIGHT BE A MOOSE OR ABEAR IN THERE!
(LAUGHTER)AND LISTEN, JUST LISTEN TO
THEIR LAME REASON.
>> ALASKA'S BOARD OF GAMESAYS DRONES GIVE HUNTERS AN
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.
>> Stephen: SINCE WHEN ISHUNTING ABOUT FAIRNESS?
IF IT WAS FAIR, WE WOULDMEET THE MOOSE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIELD, FLIP A COIN ANDTHE WINNER GETS THE GUN.
SO LIFT THIS BAN, ALASKA,AND ALLOW AMERICANS TO
FULFILL THE DREAM OF EVERYOUTDOORSMAN BAGGING A
MAJESTIC 12 POINTBUCK FROM THE COMFORT OF HIS
OWN TOILET.
FINALLY, ON TIPPY KI-YAY MOTHERWAGGER A NEW WARNING HAS BEEN
ANNOUNCED ABOUT A CAR WITH 16VALVES, FOUR CYLINDERS AND
THOUSANDS OF LITTLE LEGS.
>> MAZDA ISRECALLING 42,000 CARS
BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL DANGERCAUSED BY SPIDERS.
THE AUTOMAKER SAYS THEINSECTS ARE DRAWN BY THE
SMELL OF GASOLINE AND THENTHEY BUILD WEBS INSIDE THE
VENT HOSE.
THAT CAUSES THE FUEL TANK TOCRACK, INCREASING THE RISK
OF FUEL LEAKS AND FIRES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
ONCE AGAIN, MANKIND FACES ATHREAT OF GAS HUFFING SPIDERS.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH BRINGS ME TO A TIP OF
THE HAT TO MAZDA WHOSEHANDLING OF THIS ISSUE IS AS
SMOOTH AS THE HANDLING OFTHE MAZDA 6-4 SEDAN, MAZDA,
IT'S GOT SPIDERS IN IT.
NOW MAZDA-- QUICK TOEXPLAIN--
(APPLAUSE)>> MAZDA QUICKLY EXPLAINED
THAT NO INJURIES OR FIRESHAVE BEEN REPORTED DUE TO
THE ISSUE.
AND YOU CAN TRUST MAZDA ASEXPERTS ON THE SPIDER ISSUE
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD PLENTYOF PRACTICE.
BACK IN 2011 MAZDA RECALLEDCARS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, ACAR FULL OF SPIDERS ONCE,
SHAME ON YOU.
CAR FULL OF SPIDERS TWICE,OH GOD, THE SPIDERS ARE BACK.
NOW AT THIS POINT-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU BUY AMAZDA, SPIDERS ARE JUST A
DEALER OPTION.
SO YOU WANT AN UNDERCOATING?
NO, HOW ABOUT THE SPIDERS,NO?
OKAY, I CAN REMOVE THESPIDERS FOR $500 BUT I WILL
HAVE TO ASK MY MANAGER FIRST.
NOW IF YOU ARE A MAZDAOWNER AFFECTED BY THIS
RECALL, DO NOT WORRY BECAUSEMAZDA WILL UPDATE YOUR CAR'S
SOFTWARE FOR FREE TOINSURANCE THAT THE FUEL TANK
PRESSURE DOESN'T BUILD UP.
YES, YOU STILL HAVE THESPIDERS, BUT NOW YOU CAN USE
THE HOV LANE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
