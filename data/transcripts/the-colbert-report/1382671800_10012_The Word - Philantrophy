FOLKS, NATION, FOLKS, IDON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT
ALL THE CHARITABLE WORK IDO.
THAT'S WHAT MY PUBLICIST ISFOR.
BUT I DO DO IT.
AND I REALIZE I JUST SAIDDO-DO.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS I'M A GREAT
GUY.
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T GIVE TOCHARITY ANY MORE.
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
YOU SEE, OUR STAGNANTECONOMY HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL
ON ALL CHARITABLE GIVING.
DONATIONS TO THE TOP 400CHARITIES ARE DOWN THIS YEAR,
EVEN MY CHARITY, THE STEPHENAND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION
HAS HAD TO CUT BACK ON OURIMPORTANT WORK OF FIGURING
OUT WHAT WE WERE RAISINGMONEY FOR.
WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO ACAUSE.
FORTUNATELY ONE ORGANIZATIONOUT THERE IS USING THE FREE
MARKET TO CREATE PROPERINCENTIVES FOR DOING THE
RIGHT THING.
AND IT BRINGS US TOTONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)PHILAN-TROPHY.
FOLKS, NOTHING TUGS AT THEHEART STRINGS MORE THAN
ANIMAL CHARITIES.
ALTHOUGH I FOR ONE DON'TKNOW WHY SARAH McLACHLAN HAS
IMPRISONED ALL OF THOSE DOGSAND CATS.
LET THEM GO, YOU MONSTER!
(LAUGHTER)AND I BELIEVE IT IS
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TOPROTECT OUR DWINDLING
ENDANGERED SPECIES.
ESPECIALLY, FOLKS,ESPECIALLY THE BLACK RHINO.
YOU SEE, THERE ARE-- THEREARE ONLY ABOUT 5,000 OF
THESE MA GUESS PARTICULARCREATURES LEFT IN THE WORLD,
DOWN 96% SINCE THE MID 70s.
NOW ONE OF THE REASONS THEYHAVE BEEN DYING OUT IS
POACHERS ARE KILLING THEMAND HARVESTING THEIR PARTS
FOR TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.
FOR INSTANCE, IN CHINA IT'SBELIEVED POWDERED BLACK
RHINO HORN CAN CURE A WIDEVARIETY OF AILMENTS FROM
SNAKEBITES TO DEVILPOSSESSION.
WOW, THOSE CHINESE HAVE SOMECRAZY BELIEFS.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE WAY TOCURE DEVIL POSSESSION IS
WITH HOLY WATER.
(LAUGHTER)NOW LUCKILY-- LUCKILY, FOLKS,
ONE GROUP HAS STEPPEDFORWARD WITH A BOLD
CONSERVATION PLAN, THEDALLAS SAV ARI CLUB HAS
ANNOUNCED THEY WILL SAVE THEENDANGERED BLACK RHINO BY
AUCTIONING OFF THE CHANCE TOSHOOT ONE.
LIKE THE OLD SAYING, IF YOULOVE SOMETHING, SET IT FREE.
THEN WHEN IT HAS A BIT OF AHEAD START, OPEN FIRE.
AND, FOLKS, THE SAVVY CLUBSPOKESMAN IS APPROACHING THE
SENSITIVE SUBJECT OFSACRIFICING AN ENDANGERED
SPECIES FOR THE GREATER GOOD,WITH ALL THE GRAVITY YOU
COULD HOPE FOR.
>> THE DALLAS SAFARI CLUBWILL BE AUCTIONING OFF A
BLACK RHINO HUNT IN NAMIBIAAT THIS YEAR'S CONVENTION.
I'M SUPER STOKED ABOUT THIS.
FOLKS, THE MONEY GOES TOSOMETHING INCREDIBLE, THE
TROPHY IS JUSTASTRONOMICALMENT COY NOT
IMAGINE HAVING A BLACKRHINO.
I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO TELLYOU HOW RARE THIS IS.
>> BEST OF ALL, THE MORE YOUSHOOT, THE RARER IT GETS.
NOW THE SAFARI CLUB ISAUCTIONING OFF A SPECIAL
RHINO HUNTING PERMIT FROMTHE NAMIBIAN GOVERNMENT,
EXPECTED TO RAKE IN THREEQUARTERS OF A MILLION
DOLLARS, ALL OF WHICH GOESDIRECTLY TO NAMIBIA'S BLACK
RHINO CONSERVATION TRUST.
AND FOLKS, THE RHINOS, IFANY OF YOU ARE WORRIED, THE
RHINOS WILL NEVER EVENNOTICE.
AS DALLAS SAFARI CLUBEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BEN
CARTER SAID BLACK RHINOSTEND TO HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH
MORTALITY RATE.
GENERALLY SPEAKING OUT OF APOPULATION OF 2,000,
HARVESTING THREE RHINOS OVERA COUPLE OR THREE YEARS HAS
NO IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OFTHE RHINO HERD AT ALL.
YES, THERE ISN'T MUCH IMPACTIF YOU KILL ONE RHINO OR
THREE RHINOS, OR HOW ABOUTTHIS, WE SHOOT ALL 5,000
REMAINING RHINOS THAT WILLBRING IN 3.7 BILLION DOLLARS,
AND WE CAN USE THAT CASH TOKEEP ONE LAST RHINO SAVLY
CONFINED.
FOLKS, THIS IS THE ONLY, IBELIEVE, I BELIEVE THIS IS
THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY TOSAVE THE SPECIES.
BECAUSE AS DALLAS SAV ARECLUB DIRECTOR BEN CARTER
FURTHER SAID, PEOPLE ARETALKING ABOUT WHY DON'T YOU
DO A PHOTO SAFARI ORWHATEVER.
THAT'S GREAT BUT PEOPLEDON'T PAY FOR THAT.
HE'S RIGHT.
NO ONE WILL PAY FOR A PHOTO.
THAT'S NOT A TROPHY.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANG APHOTO ON YOUR WALL.
BUT THINK ABOUT IT, IF WEREALLY WANT TO RAISE SOME
CASH, YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLEDO PAY FOR?
THEY PAY FOR SEX.
TO SAVE THIS ENDANGEREDANIMAL, THE DALLAS SAFARI
CLUB SHOULD AUCTION OFF ANIGHT WE A RHINO.
NOW I'M NOT SAYING-- FOLKS,I'M NOT SAYING THAT SOMEONE
SHOULD GO [BLEEP] A BLACKRHINO.
THAT'S SICK.
I'M SAYING THEY SHOULD MAKELOVE TO IT.
(LAUGHTER)NOW IN THE MORNING, IN THE
MORNING-- THAT MIGHTBE-- THAT IDEA IS VERY
POPULAR WITH THE PEOPLE.
IN 9 MORNING, IN THE MORNINGYOU JUST LEAVE 750,000
DOLLARS ON THE DRESSER.
IF YOU DON'T CALL THE FIXDAY SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.
NATION, THIS DALLAS RHINOCLUB IDEA CAN RAISE MONEY
FOR ALL SORTS OF IMPORTANTCAUSES.
I MEAN WHO AMONGST US HASN'TSEEN A HOMELESS MANNING
BEGGING ON THE STREETS ANDFELT DEEP SADNESS THAT YOU
COULD NOT HUNT HIM FORSPORT.
I MEAN NEW YORK CITY, THINKABOUT THIS, NEW YORK CITY
OPERA JUST RECENTLY HAD TOCLOSE FOR LACK OF FUNDS.
IF ONLY THEY WOULD HAVE LETUS HUNT THE FAT LADY.
I MEAN I HAPPEN TO KNOWTHEIR HORNS ARE AN
APHRODISIAC IN NORWAY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT NONPROFITORGANIZATION COULD REALLY
USE THIS KIND OFFUND-RAISING TECHNIQUE?
THE DALLAS SAFARI CLUB.
I SAY WE JUST AUCTION OFF ACHANCE TO HUNT ONE MEMBER.
I MEAN THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN ALSO IT'S SUCH ABEAUTIFUL PELT.
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT, IMIGHT MAKE A VEST OUT OF IT.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
