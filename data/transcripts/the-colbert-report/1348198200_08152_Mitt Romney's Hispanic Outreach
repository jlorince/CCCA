IT WORKED.
IT'S EFFECTIVE.
AND NORFOLKS WE MIGHT JUST BE STUCK WITH THIS BARACK OBAMA FELLOW FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, FOLKS, BECAUSE MITT
ROMNEY AND REALLY ALL REPUBLICANS ARE FACING A TRUE CHALLENGE WITH THE CHANGING ETHNIC MAKEUP OF AMERICA.
AS SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR AND 9th GRADE DANCE CHAPERONE LINDSAY GRAHAM RECENTLY EXPLAINED, THE DEMOGRAPHIC RACE WE'RE
LOSING BADLY.
WE'RE NOT GENERATING ENOUGH ANGRY WHITE GUYS TO STAY IN BUSINESS FOR THE LONG-TERM.
YES, IT'S TRUE.
AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO STAY, REPUBLICANS NEED TO MAKE MORE ANGRY WHITE GUYS.
NOW OF COURSE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION IS FOR THEM TO PURCHASE MY NEW LINE OF PREMIUM MAIL ORDER SPERM,
FORMULA 401 SEEDS OF DISCONTENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HARVESTED FROM MY "GRAPES OF WRATH" T IS THE SAME WHITE MALE STARTER KIT YOU KNOW
AND LOVE BUT IN A LIMITED BATCH ESPECIALLY PRODUCED WHILE I WAS VERY ANGRY WATCHING GAY PORN.
KNOCK IT OFF!
GIVE IT A REST.
SERIOUSLY.
STILL, WITH A DWINDLING SUPPLY OF WHITE REPUBLICANS THE GOP HAS GOT TO REACH OUT.
>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING THE GOP THIS NOVEMBER CERTAINLY WILL BE WINNING LATINO VOTERS.
>> FOR ROMNEY TO WIN SWING STATES LIKE COLORADO AND NEVADA CAMPAIGN ADVISORS SAY THEY HAVE TO GET A LARGER
SHARE OF THE HISPANIC VOTE.
>> TO BECOME AS COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATS AS THE-- IN THE PAST WHILE WE'RE IN TROUBLE AS A PARTY AND I
THINK AS A NATION.
>> Stephen: YES.
IF HISPANIC GOES WITH THE DEMOCRATS IT WILL BE BAD FOR THE NATION.
IF THEY GO WITH REPUBLICANS, IT WILL ONLY BE BAD FOR HISPANICS.
NOW THE POINT IS...  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS THIS ELECTION WILL COME DOWN TO ATTRACTING LATINOS WHO, ONCE AGAIN, ARE
DOING A JOB AMERICANS AREN'T WILLING TO DO, VOTING.
SO IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE DEMOCRATS MADE SAN ANTONIO MAYOR JULIAN CASTRO THEIR CONVENTION KEYNOTE
SPEAKER WHILE REPUBLICANS COUNTERED WITH CHRIS CHRISTIE WHO WHILE NOT TECHNICALLY HISPANIC S AT LEAST 50% NACHO.
THAT'S WHY... THAT'S WHY THIS WEEK UNOVISION MEET THE CANDIDATES FORUM HOSTED BOTH ROMNEY THEN OBAMA, FOLD OF
COURSE BY A GUY IN AN APE SUIT AND A GIANT RED GRASSHOPPER.
AND FOLKS, ROMNEY HAD CLEARLY PREPARED HIMSELF TO APPEAL TO LATINOS BECAUSE HERE HE IS MONDAY ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
AND HERE HE IS LAST NIGHT ON UNIVISION.
(APPLAUSE) NOW CLEARLY HE WANTS IT, CLEARLY HE WANTS IT.
APPARENTLY HE JUST ENTERED THE SPRAY CAN BOOTH AND CRAMPED IT UP TO MONTELBON.
AND HE WASTE NOD TIME PUTTING THEIR MINDS AT EAST ABOUT HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY.
>> WE'RE TO THE GOING TO ROUND UP PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND DEPORT THEM.
THAT'S NOT LIPP LEPP I SAID DURING MY PRIMARY CAMPAIGN TIME AGAIN WE'RE TO THE GOING TO ROUND UP 12 MILLION
PEOPLE, THE KIDS AND PARENTS AND HAVE EVERYONE DEPORTED.
>> Stephen: NO, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.
NO, HE IS GOING TO DO WHAT HE SAID IN HIS PRIMARY CAMPAIGN TIME AND AGAIN.
>> WELL, THE ANSWER IS SELF-DEPORTATION WHICH IS PEOPLE DECIDE THAT THEY CAN DO BETTER BY GOING HOME
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK HERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION TO ALLOW THEM TO WORK HERE.
AND SO WE'RE TO THE GOING TO ROUND PEOPLE UP.
>> Stephen: YES, THE ANSWER IS SELF-DEPORTATION.
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO WAY TO WORK, NO WAY TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN, MAKE CONDITIONS SO UNBEARABLE, PEOPLE JUST WANT
TO FLEE.
MUCH IN THE SAME WAY CONSERVATIVES ARE SELF-DEPORTING FROM THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN.
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO IT'S EFFECTIVE.
IT IS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY.
YOU SEE, SO MITT HAS GOT THE REAL ANSWER BUT HIS WIFE ANN HAS IDENTIFIED THE REAL PROBLEM.
HERE'S WHY HISPANICS ARE RESISTING HER HUSBAND'S MESSAGE.
>> IT REALLY IS A MESSAGE THAT WOULD RESONATE WELL IF THEY COULD JUST GET PAST SOME OF THEIR BIASES THAT
HAVE BEEN THERE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINES THAT HAVE MADE US LOOK LIKE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
WHY WON'T HISPANICS JUST GET
