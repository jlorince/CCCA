>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT, SIT DOWN.
NATION, TODAY MARKS THE 25th
DAY THAT NSA LEAKER EDWARD
SNOWDEN HAS BEEN HOLED UP IN
THE MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT.
HE HAS BEEN THERE SO LONG HE
HAS FINISHED HIS SECOND
CINNABON.
(LAUGHTER)
AND NOW, FOLKS, WE MAY NEVER
GET OUR HANDS ON THIS
TRAITER BECAUSE HE HAS
OFFICIALLY PETITIONED RUSSIA
FOR ASYLUM.
OF COURSE RUSSIA WAS HIS
FALLBACK.
HE COULDN'T GET ASYLUM IN
ECUADOR OR DARTMOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT ONE SENATOR KNOWS HOW TO
PUT THE SCREWS TO THE RUSS
KEYES.
>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD
CONSIDER BOYCOTTING THE
GAMES IF RUSSIA GIVES THE
NSA LEAKER ASYLUM.
>> I LOVE THE OLYMPICS BUT I
HATE WHAT THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT IS DOING
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
IF THEY GIVE ASYLUM TO A
PERSON WHO I BELIEVE HAS
COMMITTED TREASON AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES, THAT'S
TAKING TO A NEW LEVEL.
IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME
WOULD YOU HAVE ALLOWED ADOLF
HITLER TO HOST THE OLYMPICS
IN GERMANY?
>> Stephen: YES, YES, GOOD
POINT.
IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME
AND STOP HITLER FROM DOING
ANYTHING--
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT WOULD SURELY BE
HOSTING THE 1936 BERLIN
GAMES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO, THAT IS WITHOUT QUESTION
MY NUMBER ONE HITLER RELATED
TIME TRAVEL FANTASY.
IN FACT, FOLKS, I WROTE A
SPECULATIVE FICTION NOVEL ON
THIS VERY SUBJECT ENTITLED
OPERATION JAVELIN.
IN WHICH A TIME
TRAVELINGEOUSIE OWENS NOW
TRAINED AS A SNIPER.
GOES BACK TO THE CRITICAL
MOMENT WHERE HITLER IS ABOUT
TO SIGN HIS CONTRACT WITH
THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE,
RAISES HIS LIFE EL AND
SHOOTS THE PEN RIGHT OUT OF
HITLER'S HAND.
NOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE BOOK
HITLER GOES ON TO STILL DO
THE OTHER STUFF BUT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> BUT HE NEVER GETS OVER
THE STING OF SEEING THE
OLYMPIC ITS MOVE TO
BALTIMORE.
THAT'S JUSTICE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
POINT IS-- THE POINT IS
RUSSIA TURNED OVER
