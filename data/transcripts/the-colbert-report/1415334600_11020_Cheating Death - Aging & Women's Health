FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY MUSICSOOTHES THE SAVAGE BEAST, BUT I
PREFER TO SNORT GROUND-UPZOPICLONE.
THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH DR. STEPHEN T. COLBERT D.F.A.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )FIRST, FOLKS A DISCLAIMER-- I AM
NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR.
I HAVE AN HONORARY DOCTORATE INFINE ARTS.
( LAUGHTER )I CAN'T TREAT YOUR RASH, BUT I
CAN COMPARE IT FAVORABLY TO AJACKSON POLLOCK.
AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH ISBROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT
PHARMACEUTICALS.
PRESCOTT-- THE MORE PILLS YOUTAKE, THE MORE CHANCES YOU HAVE
TO WIN.
( LAUGHTER )FIRST UP, AGING.
FOLKS, NOBODY WANTS TO GETOLDER.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED TOHEAR ABOUT A BREAKTHROUGH
TREATMENT THAT ALLOWS SCIENTISTSTO REVERSE THE AGING PROCESS IN
MICE.
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN NOW TURNBACK THE CLOCK AND RELIVE THE
EARLY VITAL DAYS OF YOUR RODENTINFESTATION.
EVEN BETTER, THE MAN IN CHARGEOF THE STUDY, HARVARD PROFESSOR
OF GENETICS, DAVID SINCLAIR,SAYS THIS AGE REVERSAL COULD
WORK IN HUMANS.
AND I BELIEVE HIM. BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE TWOWEEKS AGO.
ACCORDING TO HIS STUDY, THESECRET LIES IN A MOLECULE CALLED
N.M.N. BECAUSE WHEN SCIENTISTSFED THE MOLECULE TO MICE, THEY
NOTICED IT REVERSED AGINGCOMPLETELY IN THEIR MUSCLES,
MEANING THIS DRUG COULD GIVE YOUTHE MUSCLE TONE OF A 20-YEAR-OLD
AND ALLOW YOU TO SPEND A WHOLEOTHER LIFETIME NOT GOING TO THE
GYM.( LAUGHTER )
IF THE PROMISE OF THIS RESEARCH
IS REALIZED, PEOPLE EVERYWHERECOULD INCREASE THEIR LIFESPAN TO
AGES UNSEEN IN HUMAN HISTORY.
SO THERE WILL BE SO MANY PEOPLETURNING 100, THAT WILLARD SCOTT
AND SMUCKERS WILL HAVE THEIR OWNCHANNEL.
( LAUGHTER )AND, YES, WILLARD SCOTT WILL
STILL BE AROUND, AND, YES,WILLARD SCOTT IS STILL AROUND.
( LAUGHTER )OF COURSE, WITH MANY FEWER
PEOPLE DYING AND JUST AS MANYBEING BORN THE FIGHT FOR SCARCE
RESOURCES IS GOING TO GETTOUGHER, WHICH IS WHY PRESCOTT
PHARMACEUTICAL IS PROUD TOINTRODUCE ITS AGE-REVERSAL
SUPPLEMENT, VACSA-POINTY-STICK.
IF YOUR VIRULE 130-YEAR-OLD BODYIS BACKED INTO A CORNER
FENDING OFF STARVING HOARDS
CLAMORING FOR A BITE OF YOURSQUIRREL CARCASS, JUST
ADMINISTER A DOSE OFVACSA-POINTY-STICK.
REPEAT AS NECESSARY TOELIMINATE HARMFUL OTHER PEOPLE.
SIDE EFFECTS OFVACSA-POINTY-STICK INCLUDE
MAHOGA-KNEES, CHICKEN FINGERS,AND THE OXFORD COMA.
SECONDLY FIRST UP, WOMEN'SHEALTH.
>> OH!
>> Stephen: FOLKS, AS YOUKNOW, I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE
FIGHT AGAINST BREAST CANCER.
IN 2010, NOT ONLY DID I RACE FORTHE CURE BUT WHEN NO ONE WAS
LOOKING, I ALSO TOOK A CAB FORCURE.
( LAUGHTER )AS A CONFIRMED BOSOM BUDDY I WAS
THRILLED TO HEAR A STORY ABOUTTHE CHILEAN CITY OF ANTOFAGASTA
WHICH HAD A WATER SOURCETHAT TURNED OUT TO BE
LOADED WITH SOME EXTRAS.
>> THE WATER THERE CONTAINED 80TIMES THE ARSENIC LEVELS
RECOMMENDED BY THE WORLD HEALTHORGANIZATION.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THEWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS A
RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF ARSENIC,AND IT'S NOT ZERO.
( LAUGHTER )THE TOWN STARTED USING THAT
WATER IN 1958, AND FORTUNATELYFOR RESIDENTS, THE TOXIN WAS
DISCOVERED IMMEDIATELY 12 YEARSLATER.
BUT EVERY MUNICIPAL POISONINGSTORY HAS A SILVER LINING.
>> SURPRISINGLY, THE RESEARCHERSFOUND THE CHEMICAL WAS LINKED TO
A 50% DROP IN DEATHS FROM BREASTCANCER.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, THIS ISFANTASTIC NEWS.
FINALLY, A FEEL-GOOD STORY ABOUTINDUSTRIAL RUNOFF.
SURE, YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD SOLVENTPLANT MAY HAVE CREATED SEXUALLY
AMBIGUOUS TROUT, BUT THEIRBREASTS ARE CANCER FREE.
AND, FOLKS, WHEN YOU THINK KNOWNTOXINS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )GUN TO MY HEAD?
SURE.
( LAUGHTER )WHEN-- FOLKS, WHEN YOU THINK
KNOWN TOXINS, YOU THINK PRESCOTTPHARMACEUTICALS.
WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT, PRESCOTTIS PROUD TO INTRODUCE CHERNOBYL
SPRINGS.
WITH MORE THAN A MILLION TIMESTHE RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCE
OF VITAMIN U-235.
IT WILL MARIE CURIE WHAT AILS.
IT EVEN BEAT EVIAN IN A BLINDTASTE TEST IN THAT ALL TASTERS
WERE RENDERED BLIND.
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONIS DOES IT CURE CANCER?
WE HAVE NO IDEA.
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT CAUSESCANCER, SO IF IN A FEW YEARS YOU
DON'T GET CANCER,CONGRATULATIONS.
IT CURED YOU.
( LAUGHTER )SIDE EFFECTS OF CHERNOBYL
SPRINGS INCLUDE UKRAINE IN THEMEMBRANE.
ATOMIC FIREBALLS, AND BONUS EAR.
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR CHEATINGDEATH, BROUGHT TO YOU BY
PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICAL.
