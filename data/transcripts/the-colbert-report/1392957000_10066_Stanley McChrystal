( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHTIS A RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL
WHO SERVED IN OPERATIONS DESERTSTORM, DESERT SHIELD, ENDURING
FREEDOM, AND IRAQI FREEDOM.
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITHDESERTS OR FREEDOM, HE'S YOUR
MAN.
PLEASE WELCOME GENERAL STANLEYMcCHRYSTAL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANKS FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE ARETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL IN THE
U.S. ARMY, COMMANDER OF U.S. ANDINTERNATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM
FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN, COMMANDEROF THE JOINT SPECIAL OPERATIONS
COMMAND, OR JSOC, AND YOU HAVE ANEW BOOK HERE CALLED "MY SHARE
OF THE TASK."
ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL, BEFOREWE GET STARTED, YOU'RE MY THIRD
FOUR-STAR GENERAL.
PETRAEUS, ODIERNO, AND YOU,MAKES ME A 12-STAR HOST SO DON'T
TRY TO PULL RANK ON ME, ALLRIGHT?
DON'T TRY TO PULL RANK.
I DID NOT DO MY SHARE OF THEREADING, SO TELL ME ABOUT "MY
SHARE OF THE TASK."
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY INTHIS BOOK.
IT'S ABOUT PERSONALRESPONSIBILITY?
>> IT IS.
IT'S ABOUT BEING PART OF A TEAMBUT ACCEPTING YOUR PART OF THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT BECAUSEULTIMATELY, YOU HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHER PEOPLE,THE PEOPLE WHO YOU WORK FOR AND
WHO YOU STAND NEXT TO.
>> Stephen:  YOU COMMANDEDJSOC.
YOU ARE THE GUIDE THAT TURNEDJSOC-- THE JOINT SPECIAL
OPERATIONS COMMAND-- INTO A REALJAVELIN AGAINST AL QAEDA AND OUR
ENEMIES IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.
YOU GUYS TOOK OUT ZARQAWI.
EXPLAIN WHAT JSOC DOES.
>> IT BRINGS TOGETHER AMERICA'SMOST ELITE FORCES AND IT IT IS
USED FOR THE MOST PRECISEMISSIONS -- HIJACK, THE MISSION
AGAINST OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> Stephen:  SALE TEAM 6,DELTA GUYS.
>> ALL OF THOSE FORCES.
AND THEY'RE BROUGHT TOGETHER SOYOU CAN PUT ALL THESE
CAPABILITIES TOGETHER IN VERY,VERY DIFFICULT MISSIONS.
>> Stephen:  YOU RETIRED AFTERIT WAS NOTED IN "ROLLING STONE"
MAGAZINE THAT YOU CRITICIZED THECHAIN OF COMMAND, INCLUDING THE
PRESIDENT.
WAS THAT THE CASE OF OBAMALOSING ANOTHER AMERICAN'S JOB,
IN THIS CASE YOURS?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RETIRE?
>> THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THATCAME OUT THAT PUT PRESIDENT
OBAMA, MY COMMANDER IN CHIEF, INA DIFFICULT POSITION, AND THAT'S
NOT WHAT A COMMANDER IS SUPPOSEDTO DO WHEN HE WORKS FOR A
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
SO WHAT I DID WAS, I OFFERED MYRESIGNATION TO THE PRESIDENT,
AND HE ACCEPTED IT, AND I THINKTHAT I DID THE RIGHT THING
BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THATHAPPENS, THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS THE MISSION AND THEPEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU.
>> Stephen:  THE INSPECTORGENERAL OF THE PENTAGON FOUND
YOU HAD NOT BEEN INSUBORDINATE.
WHY DID YOU RETIRE ANYWAY?
DO YOU WANT TO CALL BACKSIES ONTHAT ONE?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> THAT WAS ACTUAL SEVERALMONTHS LATER BEFORE IT CAME OUT,
BUT THE MEDIA PSYCHE CELL YOUFIRST HAVE A FRENZY AT FIRST,
AND THEN SOME MONTHS LATERTHERE'S MUCH MORE ACCURACY.
PEOPLE HAVE TIME TO THINK ANDSTUDY AND THEY FOUND OUT WHAT
HAD BEEN IN THE ARTICLE WASN'TENTIRELY ACCURATE.
>> Stephen:  WHY TALK TO"ROLLING STONE" THOUGH?
WHY-- WHY NOT SOMETHING NOT"ROLLING STONE?"
( LAUGHTER ).
>> IF I COULD HAVE A DO-OVER, IMIGHT GO-- I MIGHT RECONSIDER
THAT.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
AFGHANISTAN-- WHAT?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND WHEN?
AND WHEN?
AND FOR THAT MATTER WHY?
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WHERE?
WE'VE BEEN THERE FOR 12 YEARS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TOHAPPEN THERE?
OR CAN WE WIN THAT WAR OR WILLWE JUST REDEFINE WHAT WINNING
MEANS?
>> WE CERTAINLY WON'T WIN.
THE AFGHAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONLYPEOPLE THAT CAN WIN THAT WAR.
BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THATAFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN IN TURMOIL,
ESSENTIALLY IN COMBAT SINCE1979.
AND SO, WE'VE HAD TWOGENERATIONS OF AFGHANS WHO KNOW
NOTHING BUT CHAOS.
SINCE 9/11, 2001, WHEN WEENTERED THAT FALL, THERE'S BEEN
AN EFFORT ON THE PART OF THEWEST, LED BY THE UNITED STATES
PRIMARILY, TO GIVE THE AFGHANPEOPLE A CHANCE TO MOVE FORWARD.
NOW, THEY'VE MADE A LOT OFPROGRESS IN THE LAST 12 YEARS,
KIDS IN SCHOOL.
THEY'VE HAD A GENERATION GROWAND HAD 14 MILLION AFGHAN
FEMALES WITH NEW OPPORTUNITIES.
THERE ARE MORE AFGHAN FEMALES INAFGHANISTAN'S PARLIAMENT THAN
THERE ARE AMERICAN FEMALES INTHE AMERICAN CONGRESS.
AND SO, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS,AND I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO
COME BACK.
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ANYINTEREST IN THE TALIBAN COMING
BACK INTO ANY KIND OF CONTROL.
>> Stephen:  YOU THINK WESHOULD BRING THE DRAFT BACK.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen:  AND AS SOMEONETOO OLD TO BE DRAFTED, I AGREE
WITH YOU.
( LAUGHTER )WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD DO
FOR US AS A NATION?
>> WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN ISTHAT SERVICE CHANGES YOU.
I THINK SERVICE MADE ME BETTERTHAN I WOULD HAVE BEEN
OTHERWISE.
I THINK EVERY YOUNG AMERICANSHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO
SERVICE FOR THE NATION, NOTNECESSARILY MILITARY.
MAYBE IN HEALTH CARE.
MAYBE IN EDUCATION.
AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GETTHE CHANCE TO SPEND A YEAR AT
PAID, NATIONAL SERVICE.
I THINK IT WOULD CHANGE HOW THEYFEEL ABOUT CITIZENSHIP.
I THINK IT WOULD CHANGE HOW WEFEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER.
I THINK PEOPLE FROM CONNECTICUTWOULD GET TO KNOW PEOPLE FROM
EAST L.A.
I THINK WE'D CERTAINLY START TOMEND SOME OF THE DIVISIONS IN
OUR SOCIETY.
>> Stephen:  WITHOUT THEDRAFT, HOW WOULD FORREST GUMP
HAVE MET BUBA?
( LAUGHTER )WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT DELICIOUS
SHRIMP COMPANY IN TIMES SQUARE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
WELL, GENERAL, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR JOINING ME.
GENERAL STANLEY McCHRYSTAL.
THE BOOK IS "MY SHARE OF THETASK."
