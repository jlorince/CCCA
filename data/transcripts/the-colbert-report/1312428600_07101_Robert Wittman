THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT RECOVERS STOLEN
PAINTINGS AND FOUND THE F.B.I.'S
NATIONAL ART CRIME SCENE.
I HEAR A LOT OF THE SUSPECTS
HAVE BEEN FRAMED.
PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT K.
WITTMAN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY MR. WITTMAN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU'VE GOT A FASCINATING JOB.
YOU ARE A FORMER SENIOR
INVESTIGATOR AND FOUNDER OF THE
F.B.I.'S ARTS CRIME TEAM.
DURING 20 YEARS OF YOUR CAREER
THERE, YOU RECOVERED MORE THAN
225 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF
STOLEN ART AND CULTURAL
PROPERTY.
NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN FIRM,
ROBERT WHITMAN INCORPORATED, AND
YOUR MEMOIR IS CALLED
"PRICELESS."
OKAY.
HOW DOES ONE BECOME AN
INVESTIGATOR IN ART CRIME?
THEY SAY IT TAKES A THIEF.
ARE YOU A CAT BURGLAR TURNED
GOOD?
>> NEW YORK I THINK WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A
REAL DEEP UNDERSTANDING AND LOVE
OF ART.
I THINK THAT THAT HELPS.
AND THEN ALSO YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ART
BUSINESS.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK
ABOUT ART AND ART HISTORY, YOU
KNOW, PEOPLE KNOW THE STORIES OF
REMBRANDT, AND THEY KNOW THE
STORIES OF RENOIR AND MONET AND
BEING BLIND AND THAT TYPE OF
THING, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ART CRIME.
ART CRIME IS ALL ABOUT THE ART
BUSINESS AND THE BUSINESS OF ART
AND HOW TO MAKE A DEAL IN THE
ART WORLD.
>> Stephen: HOW IS ART CRIME
COMMITTED BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
FROM THE MOVIES, YOU SEE, YOU
KNOW, A GRID OF LASERS AND
CATHERINE ZETA-JONES PUTS ON A
SKIN-TIGHT SUIT AND SOMEHOW
SHOWING HER BUTT HELPS GET HER
THROUGH THE GRID.
I MEAN, IS IT THAT OR DO GUYS
JUST COME IN AND SNATCH STUFF
OFF THE WALL?
>> IN 20 YEARS OF DOING THESE
INVESTIGATIONS WITH F.B.I., MOST
OF THE TIME IT'S THE GUYS COMING
IN AND SNATCHING THE THINGS OFF
THE WALL.
>> Stephen: SO ART MUSEUMS
DON'T HAVE LIKE THE GIANT DOORS
THAT COME CLOSING DOWN THAT HIT
YOU IN THE NECK?
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN THE DOORS
THAT COME TOGETHER AND CLOSE UP.
AMERICAN MUSEUMS HAVE EXCELLENT
SECURITY.
SOME OF THE BEST SECURITY IN THE
WORLD ARE IN AMERICAN MUSEUM,
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT MUSEUMS IN
NEW YORK AND OUTSIDE OF THIS
COUNTRY, IT LEAVES A LOT TO BE
DESIRED.
THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO INTEGRATE
THESE GOOD SECURITY SYSTEMS INTO
MUSEUMS THAT ARE HUNDREDS OF
YEARS OLD.
THE CASTLES IN FRANCE, THE
CASTLES IN GERMANY, VERY, VERY
HARD TO DEFEND AND SECURE.
>> Stephen: YOU EVER GO INTO A
MUSEUM, LOOK AT A PIECE OF ART
AND GO, I COULD STEAL THAT?
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T LOOK AT IT
THAT WAY.
I THINK THAT WHEN I GO...
[LAUGHTER]
WHEN I SEE THESE PLACES, I HAVE
GONE INTO MUSEUMS AROUND THE
WORLD IN HUNGARY AND IN ROMANIA
AND WHAT NOT, AND I'VE SEEN
REALLY BAD SECURITY.
AND I JUST FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
I WISH THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH
FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT
THAT.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SECURITY IS
NOT SOMETHING THAT MUSEUMS WANT
TO PAY FOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE
SEXY PART.
THE SEXY PART OF A MUSEUM IS
EXHIBITS AND IT'S PUTTING UP THE
ARTWORK.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE UNIT ITSELF.
DOES THE F.B.I. TAKE ART THEFT
SERIOUSLY?
I MEAN, DO YOU GUYS IN THE ART
GROUP, DO YOU HAVE TO SIT AT
YOUR OWN NERDY ART TABLE AT
LUNCH.
>> WHEN I WAS... I RETIRED IN
2008, AND I STARTED THE TEAM IN
2005.
WE HAD EIGHT AGENTS AT THE TIME.
TODAY I'M HAPPY TO SAY THERE ARE
13 AGENTS AT THE F.B.I. WHO ARE
TRAINED IN ART THEFT
INVESTIGATION.
SO THEY OBVIOUSLY DO TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY.
THEY ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
>> Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT SOME OF THE STUFF YOU'VE BEEN
ABLE TO RECOVER.
JIM WILL PUT UP THE FIRST
PICTURE.
WHAT IS THIS?
>> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PIECE
CALLED "THE SWING" BY FRANCISCO
GOYA.
THIS WAS STOLEN FROM A PRIVATE
HOME IN MADRID IN 2001.
>> Stephen: WHERE DID YOU FIND
THAT?
>> WE WERE ABLE TO COVER THAT IN
THE BOOT OF A CAR, WHICH IS THE
TRUNK OF A CAR, AS THEY WERE
DOING NEGOTIATIONS TRYING TO
SELL THE PAINTINGS TO ME.
WE WERE MAKING A DEAL.
>> Stephen: TO YOU?
NOW DO YOU HAVE LIKE A MUSTACHE
AND A BERET?
LIKE WHAT... DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK
LIKE A PRETENTIOUS A-HOLE WHEN
YOU GO TO RECOVER IN THE ART
WORLD AND ALWAYS HAVE A
HALF-FORMED GLASS OF CHARDONNAY
IN YOUR HAND?
LET'S LOOK AT THE NEXT ONE.
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
FIND THAT YOU MADE.
WHAT IS THIS?
>> WELL, FINANCIALLY SPEAKING,
THIS IS A RECOMMEND BRAN
SELF-PORTRAIT STOLEN BY GUNPOINT
AT THE SWEDISH NATIONAL MUSEUM
IN STOCKHOLM.
THAT WAS DONE IN 2000.
ANOTHER UNDERCOVER OPERATION IN
COPENHAGEN IN 2005.
>> SO YOU TRAVELED THE WORLD?
>> YES.
>> YOU'RE LIKE RENEE RUSSO IN
"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR."
AND I'M SURE YOU LOOK JUST AS
GOOD IN A LACE DRESS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: ROBERT WITTMAN.
THE BOOK IS "PRICELESS."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
