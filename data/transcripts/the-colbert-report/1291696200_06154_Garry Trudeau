EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS DRAWN THE
DUNES DUR COMIC FOR 40 YEARS.
I'LL ASK HIM WHY ZONKER NEVER
HOOKED UP WITH BRENDA STARR.
PLEASE WELCOME GARRY TRUDEAU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, GARRY.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> MY GREAT PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: SIR, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE ITEM AT HAND, THIS
RIGHT HERE, THIS IS 40: A
DOONESBURY RETROSPECTIVE.
FOR 40 YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
SEVEN STRIPS A WEEK.
>> THE SAME JOB.
>> Stephen: ISN'T THAT A LONG
TIME TO BE ATTACKING PRESIDENT
NIXON?
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THIS IS,
RIGHT, LIKE SHAKING YOUR FIST AT
WATERGATE.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OTHER
PRESIDENTS, AS WELL.
>> Stephen: IS THAT... THAT'S
ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS FOR DOING
IT FOR 40 YEARS, WHEN YOU SEE
SOME SORT OF CRISIS GOING ON IN
THE COUNTRY, YOU SEE OBAMA
BEHAVING X, Y, Z, DID YOU SAY, I
GOT ONE OF THESE.
I CAN GO BACK TO CARTER AND
SWITCH OUT.
NANCY PELOSI IS CYRUS VEINS AND
WE'RE DONE.
>> I HAVEN'T RECYCLED ANY
STRIPS, BUT IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
I THINK ABOUT NOW I COULD GET
AWAY WITH IT.
>> Stephen: I GOT TO SAY THIS
RIGHT HERE, THIS IS A REALLY
IMPRESSIVE VOLUME, DOONESBURY
READERS...
>> TEN POUNDS OF BOOK.
>> Stephen: TEN POUNDS.
IS THIS A DANGER ANYONE COULD
GET TRAPPED UNDERNEATH IT?
>> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY... IF
YOU'RE GOING TO READ IT, YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE SOMEONE
SPOT YOU.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
WHAT ARE WE TARGETING HERE?
>> LIFT FROM THE KNEES, SO A LOT
OF TREES DODGED THAT, ALTHOUGH
NOT AMERICAN TREES.
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
THESE ARE CHINESE TREES?
>> NO, CHILEAN TREES.
>> CHILEAN TREES IS WHERE THE
PULP CAME FROM.
>> Stephen: DID YOU FIND THAT
OUT?
>> YES.
WELL, IT WAS A GLOBAL EFFORT.
WE HAD TO FIND THE PULP, JUST
THE RIGHT PAPER IN CHILE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU EVER EXPORT
ANY OF YOUR WORK?
ARE YOUR STRIPS EVER IN INDIA
AND TRANSLATED BACK INTO
ENGLISH.
>> I EXPLAINED ALL THAT TO A
SERIES OF STRINS.
WE OUTSOURCE THE WRITING.
THERE ARE CHEAP GAG WRITERS DOWN
IN HONDURAS.
I WAS WAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE.
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO DO
THAT BECAUSE SEVEN STRIPS A WEEK
FOR 40 YEARS.
>> NO ONE MAN COULD DO THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE LIKE
DOING 161 OF THESE SHOWS A YEAR.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: LET'S LOOK AT SOME
OF THE CHARACTERS.
JIM, CAN WE HAVE FIRST SLIDE UP
THERE.
THIS IS... THIS IS ALL THE
CHARACTERS.
>> YEAH, IT'S PRETTY
SELF-EXPLANATORY.
>> Stephen: IN THE DOONESBURY
UNIVERSE AND HOW THEY'RE
RELATED.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
DON'T KILL OFF ENOUGH PEOPLE.
>> SOME OF THEM ARE DEAD.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THERE'S SOME CORNSES.
LET'S GO TO THE FIRST ONE OF
THESE PANELS.
>> THIS IS THE ALPHA CHARACTER,
DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE.
THAT'S WHERE I STARTED.
>> Stephen: YOU STARTED WITH
B.D.
WHY ISN'T IT CALLED B.D.?
WHY IT IS DOONESBURY?
>> IT WAS NOT AN INTERESTING
TITLE.
DOONESBURY HAD A MEMORABLE SOUND
IT TO.
>> Stephen: DID YOU WANT TO BE
A POLITICAL CARTOONIST?
>> IT BEGAN AS A SPORTS TRIP.
I WAS ABOUT B.D., INSPIRED BY
THE LOCAL HERO, THE QUARTERBACK
OF MY FOOTBALL TEAM.
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE SEASON.
I STARTED IN SEPTEMBER AND I
THOUGHT I'D BE DONE BY DECEMBER.
ABOUT SIX WEEKS INTO IT, I WAS
SCOUTED BY A SYNDICATE, AND I
WAS OFFERED THE JOB I CURRENTLY
HAVE.
>> Stephen: SO WHEN DID IT
BECOME... ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
AMAZES ME ABOUT DOONESBURY IS,
FIRST OF ALL, THAT SOMETHING
THIS LIBERAL COULD SURVIVE THIS
LONG.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,
WHEN I STARTED LIBERAL WAS...
YOU'RE PROBABLY TOO YOUNG TO
REMEMBER, THIS BUT LIBERAL...
>> Stephen: I'M 31.
>> LIBERAL WAS COOL.
>> Stephen: WHEN WAS LIBERAL
COOL?
>> LIBERAL WAS COOL.
A LIBERAL COULD WALK DOWN THE
STREET OPENLY, HIS HEAD HELD
HIGH, AND PEOPLE WOULD GO, THERE
GOES A LIBERAL.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
THEY WERE IDENTIFIABLE?
>> YEAH.
( APPLAUSE )
WE WERE RESPECTABLE.
WE WERE RESPECTABLE.
WE WERE LIKE BANKERS BEFORE THEY
WERE HATED.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU GUYS
DIDN'T GET BAILOUT.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: NOW, DO YOU THINK
YOU OPENED DOORS FOR OTHER
CARTOONISTS?
OBVIOUSLY NO DOONESBURY, NO
MALLARD FILLMORE.
>> MALLARD FILLMORE WAS
INTRODUCED AND SOLD I THINK AS
AN ALTERNATIVE FOR NEWSPAPER,
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO RAN
NEWSPAPERS ON THE EDITORIAL
PAGES.
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT
OF BALANCE.
BUT I THINK I MOSTLY MADE THE
COMICS WORLD SAFE FROM BAD
DRAWING.
THE ORIGINAL STRIPS WERE CONCERN
>> Stephen: TERRIBLE.
>> I WAS NOT READY FOR PRIME
TIME.
DID NOT HAVE THE SKILL SET.
>> Stephen: THEY LOOKED LIKE
THEY WERE DRAWN BY A PALSY
TODDLER.
VERY CLEVER ONE, THOUGH.
>> BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW WE
FRAMED IT.
WE MARKET IT AND TRY TURN THAT
ENTER A VIRTUE AND SAY THESE ARE
THE URGENT SCRIBBLINGS FROM
SOMEONE ON THE FRONT LINES OF
THE COUNTER-CULTURE.
>> Stephen: LET'S LOOK AT SOME
OTHER IMAGES.
THIS IS DUKE.
THIS IS BASED ON WHO?
>> HUNTER THOMPSON.
>> Stephen: THIS IS MARK.
MARK TURNED OUT TO BE GAY.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: IS THIS THE FIRST
OPENLY GAY CASHER IN A COMPIC
INDUSTRY?
>> NO, HE WAS PROCEEDED BY
ALMOST 18 YEARS BY JOANNIE'S
BOYFRIEND.
>> Stephen: BUT YOU INTRODUCED
THE FIRST OPENLY GAY CHARACTER.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO YOU SCOOPED
YOURSELF.
>> RIGHT.
A LITTLE BIT.
>> Stephen: NOT GAY CODE, BY
THE WAY.
>> AND WAS UNAWARE HE WAS GAY
FOR A LONG TIME REALLY.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE.
HOW DID HE COME OUT TO YOU?
THESE HAVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN,
CORRECT?
>> I KNEW SOMEBODY WHO STUMBLED
UPON THIS ASPECT OF HIS NATURE
VERY LATE IN LIFE, AND THAT
INSPIRED ME TO DO THE SAME WITH
MARK.
>> IS THERE ANOTHER EDITORIAL
VOICE IN THE NEWSPAPER WHO HAS
BEEN GOING FULL STEAM LIKE YOU
HAVE FOR 40 YEARS?
>> NO, I'M IT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I
THINK.
>> CHARLES SCHULZ HAD A PRETTY
GOOD RUN.
>> Stephen: YES, BUT HE'S
TAPERED OFF RECENTLY.
YOU ARE STILL GOING STRONG.
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.
THANK YOU, GARRY TRUDEAU.
THE BOOK IS "40: A DOONESBURY
