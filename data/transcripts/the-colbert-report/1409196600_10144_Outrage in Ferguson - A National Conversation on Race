WITH EMOTIONS BOILING ON BOTHSIDES PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING
TO CALL FOR THE UNTHINKABLE.
A RATIONAL DISCUSSION.
>> WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITYHERE TO TALK ABOUT INCIDENTS
OF RACE.
>> WE STILL NEED TO HAVE ADISCUSSION ON RACE IN
AMERICA.
>> IT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVEOPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT THE
REALITIES OF ISSUES LIKETHIS.
>> I THINK WE SHOULDCONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION
LONG AFTER THE MICHAEL BROWNCASE IS DONE.
>> THIS IS AGAIN ANOTHER TIMETO HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION
ABOUT RACE IN SOCIETY.
>> WELL, IF THERE HAS TO BEA FRANK AND HONEST NATIONAL
DISCUSSION ABOUT RACE INAMERICA, I GUESS I'M ALREADY
TALKING. I'LL GO FIRST
FOLKS, OUR NATION HAS A LONGSHAMEFUL
LEGACY OF SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION OFAFRICAN-AMERICANS.
AND I'LL GRANT YOU THINKS AREN'TCOMPLETELY EQUAL
WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BETTERECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES AND AREREGARDED WITHOUT SUSPICION
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, BLACKPEOPLE GET TO USE THE N-WORD.
CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON THAT.
IF YOU COULD, CLIVEN BUNDYAND HIS BUDDIES MIGHT HAVE
PAID IT.
BY THE WAY BLACK PEOPLE, WHYCAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE THESE
GUYS.
THEY WERE ARMED AND THEYDARED THE COPS TO SHOOT THEM
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
JUST FIGURE OUT WHATEVER WASDIFFERENT ABOUT THEM AND
YOU'LL BE FINE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THAT'S JUST ONE
PERSPECTIVE.
THAT'S JUST ONE, MINE.
MINE IS JUST ONE VOICE.
I'M JUST ONE PERSPECTIVEWHEN IT COMES TO THE
NATIONAL CONVERSATION ONRACE.
THIS IS A DIALOGUE.
SO NOW I CEDE THE FLOOR TOONE OF THE BLACK LATE NIGHT
HOSTS TO RESPOND
IN JANUARY OF 2015.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
