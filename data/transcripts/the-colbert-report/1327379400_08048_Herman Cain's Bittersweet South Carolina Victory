FOR TWO WEEKS.
BUT FOLKS, THERE WAS ANOTHER
HUGE WINNER ON SATURDAY.
HERMAN CAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW I URGE SOUTH CARLINIANS
TO VOTE FOR ME BY VOTING FOR
HERMAN CAIN.
AND WHEN ALL THE VOTES WERE
COUNTED, WE CAME IN NUMBER 1
PERCENT.
WHOOO!
WE ARE THE 1%.
(APPLAUSE)
EAT IT, OTHERS AND
STATISTICAL ANOMOLIES.
WE MADE IT TO INTEGERS.
AND FOLKS, THE COLBERT BUMP
IS RECONFIRMED.
HERMAN CAIN GOT ONLY 45
VOTES IN IOWA, AND 160 VOTES
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT IN
SOUTH CAROLINA HE RAKED IN A
MASSIVE 6,324 VOTES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT IS MORE THAN PERRY,
HUNTSMAN AND BACHMANN
COMBINED.
THAT MEANS WE BEAT EVERYONE
WHO WAS NO LONGER TRYING TO
WIN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS, NOW THAT THE
RESULTS ARE IN, I HAVE A
MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
I WILL GIVE THE OTHER
NETWORKS A MOMENT TO BREAK
INTO THEIR PROGRAMMING TO
CARRY THIS LIVE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.
OKAY.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS OF SOUTH
CAROLINA, WHILE YOUR TURNOUT
ON SATURDAY WAS HISTORIC,
UNFORTUNATELY, AND NO ONE
COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS,
HERMAN CAIN DID NOT WIN THE
SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY.
SO IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART
AND A SPASTIC COLON THAT I
AM RESUSPENDING HERMAN
CAIN'S SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN.
ALSO I AM HEREBY OFFICIALLY
ENDING MY EXPLORATORY
COMMITTEE TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
OF COURSE, I WANT TO THANK
THE EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE
MEMBERS FOR THEIR SERVICE.
DR. HENRY KISSINGER, PAT
BUCHANAN, CRISS ANGEL MIND
FREAK, BAGGER VANCE, GRIMA
WORMTONGUE, ROSCOE THE
SUPERINTELLIGENT FERRET, 1.5
TIMES AS INTELLIGENT AS A
NORMAL FERRET SO LIKE A DUMB
RACCOON.
CHUCK TODD, AND A ROLL OF
QUARTERS.
SO NOW THAT MY
EXPLORETATION-- EXPLORATION
HAS COME TO AN END.
WHO KNOWS WHAT I AM GOING TO
IT MAYBE I WILL BE LIKE
HERMAN CAIN AND HIT THE ROAD
IN A BUS WITH MY FACE ON IT.
MAYBE I'LL HIT THE ROAD IN A
BUNCH OF TINY CARS EACH WAY
DIFFERENT PART OF MY FACE ON
IT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
ME AND ALL THAT DELICIOUS
MONEY.
BECAUSE SINCE I AM NO LONGER
A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE, I AM
OFFICIALLY OFFERING TO
RETAKE CONTROL OF THE
DEFINITELY NOT COORDINATING
WITH STEVE STEPHEN COLBERT
SUPERPAC.
TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
