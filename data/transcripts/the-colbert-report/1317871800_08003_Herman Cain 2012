[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE.
SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY.
I WANT THE THANK YOU FOR THAT
OVATION.
I MEAN THIS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE
WAY, I AM A JUNKIE AND YOU ARE
MY PUSHER.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
NATION, MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE
BLACK STAR, FRONTED BY LEGENDARY
HIPPITY POPPERS, MOS DEF, YOU
LAMO GRANDPAS OUT THERE, AND
FRIEND OF THE SHOW TALIB KWELI.
THERE IS AN ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE
IN THE HOUSE, DARE I SAY IN THE
HIZZI.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT'S THAT?
I DON'T DARE.
OKAY.
LET'S EDIT THAT OUT.
MY APOLOGIES TO THE ENTIRE
HIZZIE.
SPEAKING OF BLACK STAR, HERMAN
CAIN.
FOR WEEKS I'VE ASSUMED THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BECAUSE
TWO-HORSE RACE BETWEEN MITT
ROMNEY AND RICK PERRY.
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN JOINED IN THE
TOP TIER BY THIS DARK-HORSE
CANDIDATE, AN EXPRESSION I USE
ONLY BECAUSE HE'S AN UNEXPECTED
CHALLENGER, NOT BECAUSE HE'S A
HORSE.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, IN THE LATEST CBS NEWS
POLL, THE FORMER GODFATHER OF
PIZZA, THE HARDEST WORKING MAN
IN THE BUSINESS HAS VAULTED TO A
TIE FOR THE FIRST PLACE WITH
MITT ROMNEY AT 17%.
CAIN HAS PICKED UP ALL THE
VOTERS WHO DON'T LIKE ROMNEY,
USED TO LIKE PERRY AND CAN'T
HAVE CHRISTIE.
REPUBLICAN VOTERS HAVE BEEN
REDUCED TO USING THE SAME
CRITERIA AS A 4:00 A.M. BARROOM
PICKUP.
HE HAS A PULSE AND NO VISIBLE
COLD SORES.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FOLKS, THAT IS A GOOD THING
BECAUSE CAIN IS ON EVERYBODY'S
LIPS.
JIM?
>> HERMAN CAIN IS SURGING PAST
RICK PERRY.
>> HE'S NOW TIED WITH MITT
ROMNEY FOR THE TOP SPOT.
>> ONE CANDIDATE CONTINUES THE
RISE TO THE TOP.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERMAN CAIN.
>> TAKE HERM CAIN.
LOOK AT WHY HE'S DOING SO WELL
RIGHT NOW.
I GUESS YOU CAN SAY WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT THE FLAVOR OF THE WEEK
BECAUSE HERM CAIN IS THE ONE UP
THERE WHO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE'S
PART OF THAT PERMANENT POLITICAL
CLASS.
HERB CAIN IS FROM A
WORKING-CLASS FAMILY.
>> Stephen: YES, HERB CAIN IS
FROM A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY.
I WONDER
