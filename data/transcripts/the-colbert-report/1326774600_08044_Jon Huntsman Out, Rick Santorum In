>> Stephen: HOLY COW STEPHEN,
STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> THANK YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, NATION.
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE, PLEASE, AS MUCH AS I
WOULD LOVE TO SIT HERE AND
LISTEN TO YOU CHANT MY NAME
WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO THE
BIG STORY, ME.
YOU SEE, ON THURSDAY IN
RESPONSE TO LEADING JON
HUNTSMAN, 5% TO 4% IN A
MAJOR POLL I ANNOUNCED THE
FORMATION OF AN EXPLORATORY
COMMITTEE FOR A POSSIBLE RUN
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF SOUTH
CAROLINA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT HAS
COMPLETELY CHANGED THE
COMPLEXION OF THIS RACE.
IT HAS GONE FROM LINEN TO
EGG SHELL.
AND TODAY IT JUST GOT A
LITTLE OFF WHITER, JIM.
>> TODAY OUR CAMPAIGN FOR
THE PRESIDENCY ENDS, BUT OUR
CAMPAIGN TO BUILD A BETTER
AND MORE TRUSTWORTHY AMERICA
CONTINUES.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, DO YOU
SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE?
THE MERE POSSIBILITY THAT I
MIGHT RUN FOR PRESIDENT BLEW
JON HUNTSMAN ALL THE WAY
BACK TO THE LAND'S END
CATALOG HE CAME FROM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: GOOD.
AGAIN, THAT'S JUST FROM ME
EXPLORING THE IDEA OF
RUNNING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT
WOULD DO TO THE FIELD IF I,
STEPHEN T COLBERT, LOOKED
INTO THE CAMERA RIGHT NOW
AND OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED,
BUT I'M NOT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BY THE WAY, THAT
SNAPPING SOUND YOU HEARD
JUST NOW WAS THE SPHINCTERS
OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES
SLAMMING SHUT.
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN.
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN CLOSELY
FOR ROMNEY BECAUSE IT STARTS
OUT ABOUT 90% CLENCHED.
ALL RIGHT.
SO HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE, FOLKS.
HUNTSMAN'S GONE.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
SAYING THAT THIS IS JUST
ANOTHER SIGN THAT MITT
ROMNEY HAS THIS RACE ALL
WRAPPED UP.
BUT NOT SO FAST.
CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES ARE
STILL KEEPING THEIR OPTIONS
OPEN AS RICHARD LAND
PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN
BAPTIST CONVENTION EXPLAINS.
>> BEFORE WE MARRY THE GUY
NEXT DOOR, DON'T YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO HAVE A FLING
WITH A TALL DARK STRANGER
AND SEE IF HE CAN SUPPORT US
IN THE MANNER IN WHICH WE
WOULD LIKE TO BE ACCUSTOMED.
AND IF WE CAN'T WE CAN
ALWAYS MARRY THE STEADY BEAU
WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES, BEFORE
CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES
SETTLE DOWN AND MARRY THE
GUY NEXT DOOR, THEY SHOULD
BANG A DARK STRANGER A FEW
TIMES.
NO NAMES, JUST ANONYMOUS,
HOT, SWEATY, MEAT SLAPPING.
YOU KNOW.
FAMILY VALUES.
(APPLAUSE)
SO TO COALESCE BEHIND A
SINGLE CANDIDATE IN SOUTH
CAROLINA EVANGELICAL LEADERS
GATHERED IN TEXAS AND TOOK A
VOTE.
>> THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE
LEADERS IN TEXAS OVER THE
WEEKEND AFTER THREE BALLOTS
OVERWHELMINGLY CHOSE
SANTORUM.
>> SANTORUM AFTER THREE
BALLOTS.
IT WAS JUST LIKE THE COLLEGE
OF CARDINALS SELECTING A NEW
POPE.
EXCEPT THAT THEY ANNOUNCED
THEIR SELECTION WITH A WHITE
PUFF OF BARBECUE SMOKE.
AND FOLKS, THIS COULD BE BIG
FOR SANTORUM.
ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME DOUBT
HOW MUCH GOD'S ENDORSEMENT
ON SATURDAY COULD HELP.
IT DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR TIM
TEBOW.
NOW PERSONALLY-- PERSONALLY
I WOULD NOT HAVE GONE WITH
SANTORUM.
IF I WERE GOD, I WOULD HAVE
GONE WITH ME.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN WHY NOT, FOLKS.
I'M A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE, I
TEACH SUNDAY SCHOOL, I
ATTEND CHURCH, AND MOST
IMPORTANTLY, I AM A WAY
BIGGER HOMOPHOBE THAN RICK
SANTORUM.
NOW SURE, SURE, HE'S PRETTY
GOOD.
HE OPPOSES GAY SEX.
BUT HE'S STILL IN FAVOR OF
HETEROSEXUAL SEX.
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
THERE'S A DUDE IN THERE,
THAT'S PRETTY GAY.
THAT'S WHY I ONLY SUPPORT
THE LADY LOVEIN LADIES.
THAT'S THE ONLY STRAIGHT
KIND.
THINK ABOUT IT.
