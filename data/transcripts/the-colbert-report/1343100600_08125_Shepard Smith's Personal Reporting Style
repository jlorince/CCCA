FOR WEEKS AND THEN DON'T.
(LAUGHTER) NATION... CUT ME, MICK.
NATION, AS YOU KNOW, I AM A LONG-TIME FAN OF FOX NEWS.
IT'S MY ONE STOP SHOP FOR NEWS,
OPINIONS, AND ADS FOR WALK-IN BATHTUBS.
(LAUGHTER) EASY ACCESS TO YOUR TUB WITH THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OF SITTING
IN YOUR OWN FILTH WHILE IT DRAINS BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN THE DOOR... (LAUGHS) OF COURSE...
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE SOME CRITICIZE FOX NEWS AS A STABLE OF OLD WHITE ANGRY MEN.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
MICHELLE MALKIN IS A YOUNG ASIAN ANGRY WOMAN.
(LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN AMONGST FOX'S EXOTIC NOAH'S ARK OF WHITE PEOPLE-- (LAUGHTER)
-- ONE BEAUTIFUL UNICORN STANDS OUT.
ANCHOR AND MANTIS-AMERICAN HELP IS SMITH.
HE'S NO COOKIE CUTTER NEWSMAN.
HE'S GOT HIS OWN STYLE.
FOR EXAMPLE, WATCH HOW GREAT BAER REPORTED ON A FEBRUARY CAMPAIGN STOP BY MITT ROMNEY.
>> MITT ROMNEY HELD SERVE ON HIS HOME COURT IN MICHIGAN AND SWEPT
THROUGH ARIZONA IN TWO CRUCIAL PRIMARY WINS TUESDAY.
NOW, ROMNEY AND HIS THREE G.O.P.
CHALLENGERS FOCUS ON WASHINGTON STATE SATURDAY AND THEN SUPERTUESDAY CONTEXT NEXT WEEK.
>> Stephen: CLASSIC BAER.
CLEAR, CONCISE, AND WITH EYES LIKE BUTTONS ON A CURSED DOLL.
(LAUGHTER) IN CONTRAST, WHATSHIP SMITH CUT THROUGH THOSE SAME FACTS TO FIND THE REAL ANGLE.
>> NOW IT'S ON TO SUPERTUESDAY AND TODAY RICK SANTORUM IS
CAMPAIGNING INTO TENNESSEE, MITT ROMNEY'S IN OHIO, AND WHETHER ROMNEY DESERVES MOMENTUM REALLY
IS QUESTIONABLE, ISN'T IT?
>> I'M SORRY, CARL, I'M LOOKING AT HIM OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER THERE.
DO YOU THINK HE'S AWARE HE'S WEARING MOM JEANS?
HE'S WEARING MOM JEANS, CARL.
IT'S 2012.
>> MITT ROMNEY'S WEARING MOM JEANS.
>> Stephen: SHEP WAS THE ONLY ONE ON DUNG REE-GATE.
IT WAS THE BIGGEST SCOOP SINCE DAVID BRINKLEY TOLD THE STORY OF J. EDGAR HOOVER WEARING MOM EVERYTHING.
(LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, IF SHEP'S AAPPROACH HAS WON HIM ADMIRERS ACROSS THE NEWS SCAPE.
EVERYONE LOVES HIM, EVEN LIBERAL SHILLS AT MSNBC KNOW GREATNESS.
>> HOW ABOUT SHEPHERD SMITH?
HE'S BUCKING THE FOX NEWS REPUBLICAN AGENDA BY TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
>> WE LOVE HIM.
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
HE'S GREAT.
HE'S GOOD AT WHAT HE IS.
>> SHEP SMITH, IF YOU EVER RUN FOR ANYTHING I WILL QUIT WHAT I AM DOING TO GO WORK FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: I SECOND THAT.
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT SHEP SMITH RUNNING FOR OFFICE IF IT MEANT RACHEL MADDOW WOULD QUIT
HER JOB.
(APPLAUSE) THESE GUYS LOVE HIM BECAUSE SHEP IS BRINGING IT!
AND BY "IT" I MEAN... WHAT?
>> WE HAVE A LOT TO HATE ABOUT NORTH KOREA, RIGHT?
BUT THE WAY THEY ALWAYS LOOK AT THINGS AND THEN THE WAY THEY THROW PARTIES IS PRETTY AWESOME.
SOMEBODY PUT GOATS ON THE ROOF.
WHAT TO DO GOATS SAY?
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO TRY TO BETTER BE SAFE THAN SORRY BUT THIS ISN'T SAFE, THIS IS STUPID.
THIS IS STUPID.
THAT'S REALLY STUPID.
KITTY CAT MEOWS THOUSAND DOLLARS.
SNOOKI'S PREGNANT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WOW, HE'S LIKE A COMBINATION OF EDWARD R. MORROW,
WALTER CRONKITE AND BARRY BUSEY.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I LOVE SHEP'S SHOW BECAUSE HE'S PUSHING THE ENVELOPE.
IT'S LIKE FOX IS A BAND AND HE'S THE TRUMPET PLAYER WHO GOT BORED
AND DECIDED TO PLAY OUT OF RHYTHM AND ACCIDENTALLY INVENTED JAZZ.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS CAT RIFF ON THE LANCE ARMSTRONG DOPING SCANDAL.
>> IF YOU ARE ACCUSED OF DOING THIS YOU WON'T COMPETE UNTIL THE ALLEGATION IS RESOLVED.
>> I WONDER IF HE WAS TAKING "V."
>> WHAT?
>> "V." I MEAN THE SHERIFFS TOOK "V."
DO YOU NOT WATCH "TRUE BLOOD"?
>> NO.
>> YOU CAN GET AMPED UP ON "V" AND GET HIGH.
DO YOU WATCH?
I'VE NEVER SEEN LANCE ARMSTRONG ON THERE BUT HE COULD PROBABLY BEAT THE WEREWOLVES.
CERTAINLY OTHER... WHAT ARE THE OTHER WOLFES?
>> MY APOLOGIES.
>> DO YOU HAVE A D.V.R.?
>> YES.
>> YOU SHOULD RECORD "TRUE BLOOD
>> WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHAT LANCE ARMSTRONG WAS ON BUT I'D LIKE
FIVE BUCK'S WORTH OF WHATEVER SHEP IS ON.
(LAUGHTER) YOU, YOU SIR... KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, SHEP.
YOU ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY THEY'RE PAYING YOU.
AND I HOPE IT'S AT LEAST KITTY CAT MEOW
