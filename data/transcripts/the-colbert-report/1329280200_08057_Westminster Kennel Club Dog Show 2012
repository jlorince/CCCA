(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, NATION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU HAVE MADE AN EXCELLENT
CHOICE ENDING YOUR NIGHT WITH
ME.
I AM A POWERFUL APHRODISIAC.
I'M LIKE A HUMAN OYSTER ONLY
WITH LESS MUSCLE TONE.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, TODAY IS ALSO THE
FINALS OF THE WESTMINSTER KENNEL
CLUB DOG SHOW.
I LOVE IT!
THE PAGEANTRY, THE EXCITEMENT,
THE SEXUAL TENSION.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, WHEN ARE THAT ANATOLIAN
SHEEPDOG AND THAT JUDGE'S LEG
GOING TO DO IT ALREADY?
(LAUGHTER)
AND, FOLKS, THERE ARE BIG
CHANGES IN THIS YEAR'S SHOW.
FOR MORE WE GO TO FOX NEWS'
WIREHAIRED PINSCHER.
SPEAK, SHEP, SPEAK!
>> THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW HAS
DROPPED THE DOG FOOD BRAND
PEDIGREE AS A SPONSOR CLAIMING
ADS LIKE THIS ONE WITH A SHELTER
DOG WITH TOO SAD.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Stephen: WOW, I KNOW ALL
DOGS GO TO HEAVEN BUT I HOPE
THERE'S A SEPARATE SECTION FOR
THESE UGGOS.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST IMAGINE YOU'RE AT HOME,
YOU'RE WATCHING CULTURED CANINE
ARISTOCRATS, THE EPITOME OF
CLASS AND E MAT LAT AINL GLANDS
AND THE NEXT THING YOU'RE FACED
WITH THIS.
>> SHELTER DOGS AREN'T BROKEN.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
THEY SIMPLY EXPERIENCED MORE
LIFE.
DO NOT PITY A SHELTER DOG.
ADOPT ONE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: OH, YES, I OFTEN
SAY AWW WHEN I'M DISGUSTED, TOO.
NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG, FOLKS.
I'M SURE SHELTER DOGS ARE WONDER
IN THEIR OWN WAY!
THEY'RE JUST NOT KENNEL CLUB
MATERIAL.
THESE DOGS ARE THE CANINE 1%.
(LAUGHTER)
THE JOB CREATORS FOR GROOMERS,
TROPHY MAKERS, AND JUDGES THAT
FONDLE BALL SACKS.
(LAUGHTER)
SHELTER DOGS ARE A CANINE
UNDERCLASS RELYING ON THE DOG
CATCHER'S SAFETY NET TO TAKE
CARE OF THEIR OUT-OF-WEDLOCK
PUBPIES.
GET A JOB!
ACCORDING TO PEDIGREE'S
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR,
PEDIGREE WAS DROPPED BECAUSE
WESTMINSTER IS FOCUSED ON THE
PURE BRED MISSION AS WELL THEY
SHOULD, MADAM.
IT'S THE SAME PURE BRED MISSION
THAT LED TO SUCH A STRONG STOCK
OF EUROPEAN ROYALS.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW SAD THEY HAD TO PUT DOWN THE
DUKE OF GLOUCESTER FOR HIP
DYSPLASIA.
GRAVE LITTLE GUY.
SO BRAVO, WESTMINSTER KENNEL
CLUB FOR KEEPING YOUR STANDARDS
UNSULLIED BY THE MIXED
