>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
NATION, THE THE GOOD NEWS FROMTHE MIDTERMS JUST KEEPS COMING.
LAST NIGHT, THE A.P. CALLEDANOTHER SENATE RACE.
ALASKA HAS TURNED RED, OR MAYBETHANKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE THAT
MIGHT JUST BE THE TEMPERATURE UPTHERE NOW. OF COURSE
ANALYZING THE MIDTERMS IS LIKEPEELING BACK THE LAYERS OF AN
ONION, IN THAT THE DEEPER YOUGO, THE MORE THE DEMOCRATS CRY.
( LAUGHTER )JIM?
>> THEY LOST CONTROL OF ALMOSTEVERY MAJOR STATE LEGISLATURE IN
THE COUNTRY.
>> WE HAVE MORE GOVERNORS ON THEREPUBLICAN SIDE BUT MORE
IMPORTANTLY THAN, THAT 70%,SEVEN OUT OF 10 STATE
LEGISLATURES ARE REPUBLICAN.
>> THAT'S WHERE THE FARM TEAMSARE FOR FUTURE CANDIDATES.
>> IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM FOR THEDEMOCRATS.
IT'S NOT JUST THE FARM TEAM ISBEING DEPLETED.
IT'S THE FARM TEAMS OF THE FARMTEAMS IN THE STATE HOUSES.
>> Stephen: DEMOCRATS HAVELOST THEIR FARM TEAMS.
NOW WHO WILL THEY TURN TO WHENHILLARY BLOWS OUT HER KNEE
AT AN IOWA PANCAKE BREAKFAST.SHE'LL BE ON THE D.L.
FARM TEAMS ARE CRUCIAL TODEVELOPING FUTURE LEADERS.
REMEMBER.
TWO YEARS BEFORE HE RAN FORPRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA WAS AN
ILLINOIS STATE SENATOR.
WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED THATTODAY HE'D BE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE WISHING HE WAS AN ILLINOISSTATE SENATOR.
( LAUGHTER )SO TONIGHT I PROFILE ONE OF
THESE PRE-HEROES IN "MR. SMITHGOES TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE,
THEN LATER POSSIBLY WASHINGTON."
( LAUGHTER )MY NEW FAV RAVE IS COLORADO
LEGISLATURE IS GORDONKLINGENSCHMITT.
I ASSUME HIS FATHER WAS ASCHMITT, AND HIS MOTHER A
KLINGON.
KLINGENSCHMITT IS A FORMER NAVYCHAPLAIN WHO CAMPAIGNED WITH A
SIMPLE MESSAGE?
>> WHY AM I HOLDING THISPITCHFORK?
I WANT THIS TO BE A SYMBOL OFTHE POSITIVE CAMPAIGN
THAT I AM RUNNING.
>> Stephen: IT IS REMINISCENTOF THE POSITIVE CAMPAIGN THE
VILLAGERS RAN TO ELECTFRANKENSTEIN.
BUT KLINGENSCHMITT'S CAMPAIGNSTANDS FOR SO MUCH MORE.
HE'S THE HEAD OF THE PRAY INJESUS' NAME PROJECT OR
PIJNP, WHICH HAS BEENDESIGNATED AS AN ANTI-L.G.B.T.
HATE GROUP BY THE SOUTHERNPOVERTY LAW CENTER.
BUT KLINGENSCHMITT DOESN'T HATETHE GAYS.
HE'S JUST CONCERNED FOR THEM ASHE DEMONSTRATES ON HIS YOUTUBE
PROGRAM.
>> THE DEMONIC SPIRITSINSIDE THE HOMOSEXUAL
AGENDA THAT ARE TRYING TOREDEFINE FAMILY AND
HOMOSEXUALIZE AND RECRUIT YOURCHILDREN, NEITHER THE
EFFEMINATE NOR THE HOMOSEXUALSWILL INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
JESUS, IF HE WERE PROVIDINGMARRIAGE COUNSELING TO TWO GAY
MEN WHO WERE MARRIED, JESUSWOULD COMMAND THEM TO GET
DIVORCED.
>> Stephen: YES, IF JESUS WERETHEIR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR, HE
WOULD TELL THEM TO GET DIVORCED,AND HE'D TAKE 65 MINUTES TO DO
IT SO HE COULD CHARGE THEM FORTHE SECOND HOUR.
FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST THE GAYS.
IT'S NOT JUST THE GAYS.
EVERYONE NEEDS A LITTLEKLINGENSCHMITT EXORICISM.
>> DON'T YOU THINK IT'SSOMETHING INSIDE THE ATHEIST
COMPLAINER THAT'S WRONG?
I HAVE A SOLUTION.
LET'S DO AN EXORICISM, AND CASTTHE DEVIL OUT OF THEM.
JULIUS GENACHOWSKI THE F.C.C.CHAIRMAN  HAS NOT ENFORCED
DECENCY STANDARDS. THE DEMONICSPIRIT INFLUENCES HIM TO ABUSE
AND MOLEST AND DARE I SAYVISUALLY RAPE YOUR CHILDREN
WE PRAY AGAINST THE DOMESTICENEMIES OF THE CONSTITUTION.
AGAINST THE DEMON OF TYRANNY WHOIS USING THE WHITE HOUSE
OCCUPANT, THAT DEMONIC SPIRIT ISOPPRESSING US.
FATHER, WE COMMAND IT TO LEAVE.
WE PRAY THAT YOU WILL HELP THEPRESIDENT REPENT.
>> Stephen: YES, OBAMA ISPOSSESSED BY A DEMON.
AND HE WON'T EVEN US THE DEMON'SBIRTH CERTIFICATE.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS
POSSESSED BY A DEMON COULD BESEEN AS A TAD INFLAMMATORY, BUT
AFTER HE WAS ELECTEDKLINGENSCHMITT TOLD A
CHICAGO NEWPAPAER, QUOTE
"I WOULD SAY IT'S TIME FORPEOPLE OF GOOD WILL ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE POLITICAL DEBATE TOCOME TOGETHER TO HAVE REASONABLE
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THESE ISSUES."
YES.
NOW THAT THE BRUISING CAMPAIGNIS OVER, DEMOCRATS SHOULD JOIN
KLINGENSCHMITT IN A REASONABLEDISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
BARACK OBAMA IS POSSESSED BY ADEMON.
( LAUGHTER )IS THAT SO HARD?
( APPLAUSE )YOU--
( CHEERS )YOU CAN EXPRESS YOUR POINT OF
VIEW THAT HE IS NOT, ANDKLINGENSCHMITT CAN EXPRESS HIS
POINT OF VIEW THAT A DEMON MADEYOU THINK THAT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
