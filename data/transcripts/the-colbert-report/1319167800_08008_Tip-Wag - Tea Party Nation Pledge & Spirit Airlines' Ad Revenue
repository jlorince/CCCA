HOLE, TONY BLAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION, IT'S NOT MY JOB TO TELL
YOU WHAT TO THINK; IT'S MORE OF
A HOBBY.
THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, FOLKS, IT IS NO SECRET
THAT BARACK OBAMA IS DESTROYING
THIS COUNTRY SINGLE-HANDEDLY.
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THE OTHER
HAND IS DOING SOMETHING GAY TO
YOUR GUN.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, ACCORDING TO
RASMUSSEN, IF THE ELECTION WERE
HELD TODAY BARACK OBAMA WOULD
LOSE TO HERMAN CAIN.
BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT NOVEMBER,
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD GO
WRONG IS IF SOMETHING GOES
RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP
OF MY HAT TO THE TEA PARTY
NATION.
ON TUESDAY, THE FOR-PROFIT GRASS
ROOTS GROUP E-MAILED ALL 30,000
OF ITS MEMBERS ASKING THEM TO
TAKE THE FOLLOWING PLEDGE.
"I, AN AMERICAN SMALL-BUSINESS
OWNER, PART OF THE CLASS THAT
PRODUCES THE VAST MAJORITY OF
REAL WEALTH-PRODUCING JOBS IN
THIS COUNTRY, HEREBY RESOLVE
THAT I WILL NOT HIRE A SINGLE
PERSON UNTIL THIS WAR AGAINST
BUSINESS AND MY COUNTRY IS
STOPPED."
(LAUGHTER)
AMEN.
FOLKS, WITH AMERICANS HURTING,
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE.
THAT SOMETHING-- NOTHING.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SADLY, NOTHING MAY NOT BE
ENOUGH.
TO ENSURE OBAMA'S DEFEAT, I CALL
ON ALL AMERICANS, NOT ONLY NOT
TO HIRE EACH OTHER, BUT TO
ACTIVELY DRIVE THE ECONOMY OFF A
CLIFF WHERE IT WILL PLUNGE DOWN
TO THE CANYON FLOOR OF LIBERTY.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY'LL SAY "OH BUT STEVEN, THIS
IS MY BUSINESS.
I WANT IT TO DO WELL.
AND I MAY HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE."
WELL, STOP BEING SO SELFISH.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF THIS COUNTRY--SUCCESS IS NOT
AN OPTION.
AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS ACHIEVED
GREATNESS BY WORKING TOGETHER,
AND NOW WE MUST UNITE AGAIN TO
ENSURE A BRIGHTER TOMORROW BY
WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE A
( BLEEP ) TODAY.
(LAUGHTER)
FINALLY--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FINALLY, FOLKS, I LOVE AIR
TRAVEL.
I BOOK FLIGHTS ALL THE TIME.
ESPECIALLY WHEN I FORGET TO TiVO
RERUNS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY."
THAT ROUND TRIP TO AUTOMATICLAND
CAUGHT ME UP ON SEASONS TWO AND
THREE.
AND I AM ALWAYS EXCITED BY THE
LATEST COST-SAVING MEASURES OF
OUR FLYING PEOPLE TUBES.
FROM CUTTING IN-FLIGHT MEALS TO
REMOVING BATHROOMS TO BEING-- I
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GET THAT BUS
OFF THE GROUND.
WELL, TONIGHT I'M GIVING A TIP
OF MY HAT TO SPIRIT AIRLINES FOR
CREATING A NEW REVENUE STREAM.
FOR $14 MILLION, A COMPANY CAN
ADVERTISE FOR A YEAR ON THE
EXTERIOR OF EVERY SPIRIT
AIRLINES JET.
THEY'RE TURNING JETS IT INTO
FLYING BILLBOARDS.
AND FINALLY REACHED COVETED
DEMOGRAPHIC OF 18 TO 34-YEAR-OLD
MALE GEESE.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW FOLKS, I'M HAPPY TO REPORT
THE AD-VERTUNITIES DO NOT END
THERE BECAUSE SPIRIT IS SELLING
AD SPACE ON OVERHEAD BINS, TRAY
TABLES, AND AIR SICKNESS BAG.
THAT IS GENIUS.
NOW, WHEN PASSENGERS VOMIT,
THEY'LL BE REMINDED OF CINNABON
TWICE.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I SAY, WHY TOP THERE?
WHY NOT REPLACE THE PILOT AND
COPILOT WITH CAPTAIN MORGAN AND
CAPTAIN CRUNCH.
PART OF A COMPLETE BREAKFAST.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS, WHEN THE CABIN LOSES
PRESSURE, JUST DROP AN AD FOR
THE OXYGEN NETWORK.
REMEMBER, MARKET TO YOURSELF
FIRST BEFORE MARKETING TO YOUR
CHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
AND WHY LIMIT THE NONSTOP
AD-SLAUGHT TO PLANES.
ISN'T IT TIME THAT TSA AGENTS
USED THE HAMBURGER HELPER HAND
TO CONDUCT CAVITY SEARCHES?
RELAX, IT'S ONLY THREE FINGERS.
AND HE'S SO HAPPY ABOUT IT.
WE'LL BE RIG
