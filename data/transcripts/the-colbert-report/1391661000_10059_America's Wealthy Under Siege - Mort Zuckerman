(LAUGHTER)IN OTHER NEWS, FOLKS, IT'S
NO SECRET THAT AMERICA'SWEALTHY ARE UNDER
SIEGE. IT'S LIKE THEFRENCH REVOLUTION THESE
DAYS.
BUT OUR POOR PEOPLE ARE TOOLAZY TO PUT ON UPLIFTING
MUSICALS.
BUT THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OFENERGY TO DEMONIZE MY FRIEND
VENTURE CAPITALIST TOMPERKINS.
HE IS SUDDENLY PUBLIC ENEMYNUMBER ONE JUST BECAUSE HE
HAD THE COURAGE TO SPEAKTRUTH TO POVERTY.
>> THERE IS OUTRAGE TODAYOVER COMMENTS MADE BY
VENTURE CAPITALIST TOMPERKINS IN A LETTER TO THE
EDITOR OF "THE WALL STREETJOURNAL" HE WROTE QUOTING
NOW WRITING FROM THE EPICENTER OF PROGRESSIVE
THOUGHT, SAN FRANCISCO, IWOULD CALL ATTENTION TO THE
PARALLELS OF FASCIST NAZIGERMANY TO ITS WAR ON ITS 1%,
NAMELY ITS JEWS TO THEPROGRESSIVE WAR ON THE
AMERICAN 1% NAMELY THE RICH.
>> Stephen: WELL SAID,TOMING WELL SAID.
THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TOFIGHT BIGOTRY THAN EQUATING JEWS
TO A WEALTHY CABAL.
NOW SOME SAYMR. PERKINS HERE IS OUT OF
TOUCH.
BUT I THINK HE IS SPOT ONWITH HIS NAZI ANALOGY.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO ELSECALLED THEIR ENEMIES NAZIS,
THE JEWS.
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ANTI-SEMITENOW?
IT'SSTILL ME? OK
GOT TO WORK ON THAT.
GOT TO WORK ON THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
>> WELL, DESPITE NEARUNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION TOM
PERKINS SOMEHOW FOUND THECOURAGE TO GO ON A NETWORK
OWNED BY A BILLIONAIRE TOMAKE HIS CASE TO THE
NONBILLIONAIRES.
>> YOU ARE AMULTIMILLIONAIRE.
>> NO, I'M NOT A BILLIONAIRE>> I SAID MULTIMILLIONAIRE.
>> I CREATED SOMEBILLIONAIRES BUT I
UNFORTUNATELY AM NOTONE.
I CAN BUY A SIXPACK-OF-ROLEXES, BUT SO
WHAT.
>> SO WHAT, HE'S JUST AREGULAR NONBILLIONAIRE JOE
SIX PACK OF ROLEXES.
BUT SOMEHOW THIS APPEARANCEFAILED TO WIN OVER THE 99%
THANKS TO PRESIDENT OBAMALIBAND THE PROGRESSIVECRAT
DEMAGOGUING ABOUT INCOMEINEQUALITY, THE POPE ATTACKING
THE SO-CALLED IDOLATRY OFMONEY AND HOLLYWOOD
VILIFYING THETHE WEALTHIEST 1% OF
DRAGONS.
I MEAN COME ON, COME ON, THEdesLATION OF SMAUG?
HOW ABOUT THE APPRECIATIONOF SMAUG.
DON'T GET MAD AT HIM JUSTBECAUSE HE WAS SMART ENOUGH
TO PUT EVERYTHING IN GOLD.
I MEAN NO WONDER WE WEALTHYFEEL OUR ENEMIES CLOSING IN.
AS ONE ANONYMOUS 1%ER TOLD"POLITICO" THE RICH FEAR
THEY'RE IN DEEP, DEEPTROUBLE.
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLEWHO SEE CONSPIRACIES
EVERYWHERE.
YES, BECAUSE CONSPIRACIESARE EVERYWHERE.
TELL ME THIS, IF THERE IS NOPLOT AGAINST THE RICH PEOPLE,
HOW COME SOMEONE IS KEEPINGA LIST OF THE RICHEST
PEOPLE?
(LAUGHTER)OKAY?
THINK ABOUT IT.
OH, OH, AND THE RICH WON'TBE SAFE AT HOME.
I MEAN THERE ARE MILLIONS OFPOOR PEOPLE OUT THERE.
JUST LOOK AT THE SECURITYCAMERA FOOTAGE OUTSIDE MY
GATED COMMUNITY.
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T LET ONEOF THEM BITE YOU.
THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME POORTOO.
DO WHAT I DO, TO HOLD THEMAT BAY I ALWAYS CARRY A
PHOTO OF ME AND BONO.
SO WHEN THE POORS COME FOR MEI CAN PROVE I KNOW A GUY
WHO DOES AFRICA STUFF.
THE POINT IS, THIS IS CLASSWARFARE PLAIN AND SIMPLE,
AND THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPENIN AMERICA BECAUSE WE ARE A
COUNTRY WITHOUT CLASSDISTINCTION.
HERE TO AGREE WITH ME ISREAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, OWNER
OF THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS",AND FELLOW AMERICAN, MORT
ZUCKERMAN, THANKS SO MUCHFOR COMING OUT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
MORT --(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW MORT, IHAVEN'T SEEN YOU AT THE
CLUB LATELY TO TALK ABOUTTHIS.
BUT YOU DO ALL RIGHT.
DO YOU BELIEVE OUR FELLOWWEALTHY ARE TRULY WORRIED
ABOUT ALL THIS DEMAGOGUERY
>> I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE.
I ACTUALLY THINK THE ISSUEIS NOT REALLY THE WEALTHY,
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THATWE HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED ORUNDEREMPLOYED, IT'S NOT A
QUESTION OF JUST INEQUALITY,A QUESTION OF NO JOBS.
>> Stephen: SO EVEN THEPEOPLE WITHOUT DO THINGS
LIKE CALLING FOR A HIGHERMINIMUM WAGE ARE CALLING FOR
HIGHER TAXES ON THE WEALTHY,A REDIRECTION OF WEALTH,
THOSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TOWHIP UP POOR PEOPLE WHO
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANDTHEY'RE CHOOSING GUYS LIKE
YOU AND ME AS EASY TARGETS?
>> WELL, I MEAN, I CERTAINLYTHINK YOU ARE AN EASY
TARGET.
>> Stephen: WELL, I DON'THAVE YOUR SECURITY TEAM.
>> INTO, I THINK LOOK, IHAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN
PROGRESSIVE TAXATION.
I DON'T HAVE DIFFICULTY WITHTHAT.
I HOPE TO BELIEVE IN A FAIRWAGE BUT I DO THINK WHEN YOU
HAVE AS WE DO HAVE TODAY 40MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY WHO ARE EITHERPART-TIME WORKERS OR HAVE NO
JOBS AND HAVE GIVEN UPLOOKING FOR WORK, WE HAVEN'T
SEEN THAT IN NOT SINCE THE1930s.
THAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM INTHIS COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: YOU WROTE THATANONYMOUS QUOTE, THAT SOME
RICH PEOPLE ARE GETTINGWORRIED THAT THEY'RE BEING
MADE SCAPE GOATS, DO YOUFEEL THAT IT'S FAIR.
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'SFAIR FOR US TO BE TARGETED
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE DONEWELL.
>> LISTEN,.
>> Stephen: I DON'T FINDTHAT FUNNY.
(LAUGHTER)>> LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ACERTAIN SORT OF-- AS THE
FRENCH WOULD SAY OF THE-- .
>> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IFWE CAN SAY THAT ON
TELEVISION.
>> WHAT IS THAT.
>> THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ACERTAIN HOSTILITY IN THIS
COUNTRY TO THE WEALTHY.
IT HAS BEEN WITH US FOR A100 YEARS AND IT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE.
BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PARTOF THIS COUNTRY THAT IF YOU
HAVE ENERGY AND TALENT YOUCAN MOVE UP THE INCOME LADDER
OR WEALTH LADDER UP TO YOUROWN ABILITIES AND THAT'S
BEEN A PART OF MAKES THISCOUNTRY GREAT.
>> Stephen: YOU USED TOSUPPORT OBAMA ARE YOU STILL
ON BOARD.
>> NO, I STOPPED BEING ASUPPORTER OF HIS BECAUSE I
THOUGHT HIS POLICIES DID NOTDO EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT TO CREATEENOUGH JOBS AND STIMULATE
THE ECONOMY.
I THOUGHT HE HAD A VERY WEAKRECOVERY PROGRAM FROM WHAT
WAS A RECESSION THAT WE WEREIN.
AND THAT, WHEN I SAW THAT,AND I WAS UP CLOSE TO HIM,
THAT HE WAS MORE FOCUSED ONTHE POLITICS OF ISSUE THAN
ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THEISSUE, I THOUGHT THIS GUY IS
NOT SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT ITHINK IS THE MOST SERIOUS
PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY.
WHICH IS A LACK OF JOBS FORENOUGH PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOUTHINK OF MY FRIEND TOM
PERKINS ANALOGY THAT RICHPEOPLE ARE IN DANGER OF
BEING TREATED LIKE THE JEWSIN NAZI GERMANY, DO YOU
THINK THAT IS A FAIRCOMPARISON.
>> I THINK IT AN OUTRAGEOUSCOMPARESON.
>> Stephen: I AGREE WITH YOUBECAUSE THE PEASANTS RISING
UP AGAINST THE URBAN ELITEIS REALLY MORE LIKE THE
KHMER ROUGE, ISN'T IT?
>> WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT ISVILLIFYING OF THE RICH.
THE POPE UPSETS ME, YOUKNOW, THAT HE SAID, YOU KNOW
THERE IS THE IDOLATRY OFMONEY.
AND IS HE UPSETTING YOUENOUGH TO LEAVE THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH?
ARE YOU THINKING OF LEAVING.
>> SUCH A GOOD QUESTION BUTI WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO MY
RABBI BEFORE I GET BACK TOYOU ON THAT.
>> Stephen: PLEASE.
(APPLAUSE)THANK YOU, MORT, MORT
ZUCKERMAN, EVERYBODY.
