[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK
YOU SO MUCH
THIS IS IT, NATION-- IT'S SUPER
TUESDAY!
IT'S LIKE THE SUPER BOWL OF
POLITICS, IF THE SUPER BOWL WAS
ONE TEAM SLOWLY DESTROYING
ITSELF.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND JUST LIKE THE SUPERBOWL, I
HAVE PAINTED MY FACE WITH MY
TEAM COLORS:
WHITE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'M HAVING A LITTLE TAILGATE
PARTY.
I'M COOKIN' UP SOME BRATS HERE
ON THE OL' SMOKEY JOE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NEW MEXICO, -- MMMMM
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISN'T A REAL
GRILL.
"BIG GOVERNMENT FIRE MARSHALL"
WANTS US TO AVOID "CARBON
MONOXIDE POISONING."
[ LAUGHTER ]
JOKE'S ON HIM WHEN YOU ALL GET
TRICHYNOSIS FROM THESE UNCOOKED
BRATS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'M GONNA MAKE MY FAMOUS
TEN-LAYER DIP, WITH ONE LAYER
FOR EACH STATE WITH A PRIMARY
TODAY.
WE'VE GOT POTATOES FOR IDAHO,
HAM FOR VIRGINIA, SOME VERMONT
CHEDDAR, FOR ALASKA, SOME
VENISON, AND FOR OHIO, A LAYER
OF RUST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, OF THE COURSE -- YOU
CAN'T HAVE A PARTY WITHOUT A
BATCH -- BATCH OF MY FAMOUS
AMERICAN SALSA.
IT'S MOSTLY MAYONNAISE WITH A
DASH OF MIRACLE WHIP.
I'VE GOT A KEG OF BEER, AND IN
CASE ROMNEY WINS, I'VE GOT A KEG
OF CAFFEINE-FREE DIET COKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND OH I'M MIXING UP MARGARITAS.
COULDN'T FIND MY BLENDER, SO I'M
USING THIS TRANSVAGINAL
ULTRASOUND WAND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MMM.
YOU KNOW, USUALLY AT PARTIES,
THIS DOESN'T COME OUT UNTIL
AFTER THE MARGARITAS.
SALTY.
AND ALL THIS IS BECAUSE SUPER
TUESDAY IS "THE" DECIDING NIGHT.
AND THE CANDIDATES HAVE ALL BEEN
FOCUSING ON A KEY DEMOGRAPHIC.
>> THOSE BLUE COLLAR VOTERS WHO
WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE
GENERAL ELECTION.
>> RICK SANTORUM HAS TALKED A
LOT ABOUT HIS BLUE COLLAR ROOTS.
>> GOV. ROMNEY HAS TRIED TO KIND
OF LOOSEN UP.
HE'S APPEARED AT EVENTS WITHOUT
A TIE, WITHOUT A JACKET, LOOKING
VERY CASUAL.
HE'S CLEARLY LOOKING TO CONNECT
WITH BLUE COLLAR FOLKS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, EVERYONE'S
GETTIN' ALL RELAXED AND AVERAGE
TO CONNECT WITH BLUE COLLAR
VOTERS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M GONNA ROLL UP MY SLEEVES
I'M GONNA ROLL UP MY SLEEVES AND
OF COURSE AS AN AVERAGE JOE
BREAK OUT THE LUNCH PAIL
AND STRAP ON MY BLUE COLLAR.
NOW I'M JUST A WORKING JOE!
HEY FELLAS!
LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE
FACTORY-PLANT AND FOUNDRY US
SOME METAL GOODS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELDING, AM I RIGHT?
SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS OWN THIS
COMPANY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH RELAXING.
SO LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE
RESULTS!
NATION, WITH ZERO PERCENT
REPORTING,
THE COLBERT REPORT CAN
OFFICIALLY PROJECT:
NOTHING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE WE TAPE THIS AT SEVEN,
AND THE POLLS CLOSE AT EIGHT.
-- WE TAPE THE SHOW AT 8:00 AND
THE POLLS CLOSE AT NINE.
BUT I HAVE GONE TO A LOT OF
TROUBLE HERE, AND I GOTTA REPORT
THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING.
SO LET'S GO TO RUSSIA, WHERE WE
ARE PREPARED TO PROJECT THAT
VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL ONCE AGAIN
BE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA.
VERY STRONG SHOWING.
IN FACT, IN ONE PRECINCT, PUTIN
WON BY A DECISIVE MARGIN OF 1482
TO 1, WITH AN IMPRESSIVE TURNOUT
107%.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVIDENTALLY, VOTERS REALLY
RESPONDED TO HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN
"PUTIN 2012: OR HE'LL SHOOT YOUR
FAMILY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND JUST NOW WE HAVE SOME
SURPRISING RESULTS FROM TODAY'S
INDIA STATE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS,
WHERE RAHUL GANDHI AND HIS
RULING CONGRESS PARTY BEEN
KICKED IN THE SOMOSAS BY UPSTART
CHALLENGER AKHILESH YADAV AND
HIS SAMAJWADI PARTY.
IT SEEMS GANDHI AND NATIONAL
CONGRESS TRIED TO CURRY FAVOR
WITH THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH,
ONLY TO LEARN IT WAS A
NAAN-STARTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CHICKEN VINDALOO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'LL HAVE MORE RESULTS AS THEY
COME IN.
GARY THURSTON OF BALTIMORE, WE
SHOULD KNOW AT ANY MINUTE IF YOU
HAVE CHLAMYDIA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
