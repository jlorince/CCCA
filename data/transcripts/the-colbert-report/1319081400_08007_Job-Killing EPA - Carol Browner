THE E.P.A. IS USELESS.
THAT IS AN INDISPUTABLE FACT.
HERE TO DISPUTE THAT FACT IS
SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR
AMERICAN PROGRESS AND FORMER
HEAD OF THE E.P.A. CAROL
BROWNER.
CAROL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY, CAROL.
I'LL BITE.
WHY THE E.P.A.?
WHY DO WE NEED IT?
MAKE YOUR CASE.
>> WE NEED THE E.P.A. FOR TWO
REASONS.
ONE, WE NEED IT TO PROTECT OUR
AIR, OUR WATER, THE HEALTH OF
OUR COMMUNITY, THE HEALTH OF OUR
CHILDREN.
>> STEPHEN: WE PROTECTED THE
AIR AND THE WATER.
WE CLEANED IT UP.
NOW YOU ARE JUST RUBBING IT IN
OUR FACES BY CONTINUING TO KEEP
IT CLEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
WHAT'S YOUR SECOND ONE?
I KNOCKED THAT ONE DOWN.
>> THE E.P.A. CREATES
OPPORTUNITIES.
>> STEPHEN: OH, NO, YOU DO
NOT.
>> WE DO.
>> STEPHEN: YOU MARCH AROUND
THE COUNTRY.
AS SOON AS AN EMPLOYER IS ABOUT
TO HAND OUT START PAPERWORK TO A
NEW EMPLOYEE, YOU SLAP IT OUT OF
THEIR HAND DATES.
>> E.P.A. CREATES JOBS.
>> STEPHEN: HOW SO?
>> WHEN E.P.A. SAYS THAT A NEW
SCRUBBER IS NEEDED, SOMEONE HAS
TO ENGINEER THE SCRUBBER, TO
BUILD IT, INSTALL IT, MAINTAIN
IT, OPERATE IT.
THOSE ARE AMERICAN JOBS.
>> STEPHEN: TELL ME ONE THING
THE E.P.A. NEEDS TO DO NOW.
>> THEY NEED TO REGULATE
MERCURY.
MERCURY IS A NEUROTOXIN.
IT'S BAD FOR OUR BRAINS.
IT'S BAD FOR OUR CHILDREN'S
BRAINS.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT?
WHAT?
NO.
WE PUT THOSE IN THERMOMETERS AND
PUT THOSE IN OUR CHILDREN'S
MOUTH.
YOUR LOGIC EATS ITSELF.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE CHINA ARE EATING OUR LUNCH
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS,
AND THEY CAN BUILD FACTORIES
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THE COSTS
OF EXTRA SCRUBBERS OR EXTRA
SAFETY FOR THEIR WORKERS.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO HOBBLE
AMERICAN FACTORIES?
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BIND THE FEET
OF AMERICAN FACTORY OWNERS?
>> YOU'VE BEEN TO CHINA, RIGHT?
>> STEPHEN: I'VE BEEN TO CHINA
MANY TIMES.
>> AND YOU'VE BREATHED THE AIR?
>> NO, I BRING MY OWN TANK.
>> THAT'S... WE'LL GIVE EVERY
AMERICAN THEIR OWN TANK.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER JOB
CREATOR.
THAT'S A JOB CREATOR.
IF THERE IS MORE POLLUTION, THEN
THERE'S MORE WORK FOR THE
DOCTORS WHO HAVE TO CURE US OF
THE DISEASES WE GET FROM THE
THINGS WE EAT AND DRINK.
>> I LEFT OUT THE DOCTORS.
>> STEPHEN: I CAN USE YOUR OWN
LOGIC AGAINST YOU.
OKAY.
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET, YOU
WANT TO PROTECT MOTHER NATURE,
RIGHT?
>> I WANT TO PROTECT THE AIR AND
WATER.
>> STEPHEN: RIGHT, RIGHT.
WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE AIR
AND WATER HAS DONE TO US LATELY?
HURRICANE, TORNADOES.
I THINK IT'S TIME WE FIGHT BACK.
[LAUGHTER]
GIVE THEM A TASTE OF THEIR OWN
MEDICINE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS WE HAVE COME TO THE POINT
WHERE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
JOBS AND CLEAN WATER.
THAT'S ALL THESE REPUBLICANS ARE
SAYING.
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE.
IN FACT, CLEAN WATER WILL BE
GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY.
SOMEONE DID A STUDY OF THE CLEAN
AIR ACT, 20 YEARS, TWO TRILLION
DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.
>> STEPHEN: I READ ANOTHER
STUDY THAT IT COSTS $10 TRILLION
JUST TO PRINT THE E.P.A.
REGULATIONS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
>> Stephen: I READ THAT.
I READ THAT SOMEPLACE.
WELL, CAROL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME FOR THIS
CONVERSATION.
FORMER E.P.A. ADMINISTRATOR
CAROL BROWNER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
