>> Stephen: ARE WE STARTING THE
SHOW RIGHT NOW?
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, YES.
VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.
BUT DO YOU KNOW MY MIDDLE NAME?
(LAUGHTER)
THANKS FOR JOINING US,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, THE SOUTH CAROLINA G.O.P.
PRIMARY CAMPAIGN IS IN FULL
SWING.
CANDIDATES ARE SHAKING HANDS,
KISSING BABIES, AND
STRATEGICALLY IGNORING
CONFEDERATE FLAGS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE ONE ISSUE DOMINATING THE
COVERAGE IS ALL THE MONEY IN
POLITICS.
NOW, YOU KNOW HOW I STAND ON
THIS ISSUE.
I STAND ON A PILE OF MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE ALWAYS AGREED WITH
POLITICAL PUNDITS AND BOY PUPPET
COME TO LIFE GEORGE WILL.
JIM?
>> DO WE HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY IN
POLITICS?
>> I'M ASTONISHED AT HOW LITTLE
MONEY THERE IS IN POLITICS
CONSIDERING THE STAKES OF OUR
POLITICS AND ALLOCATING WEALTH
AND OPPORTUNITY.
IN ABOUT FOUR WEEKS, GEORGE,
PEOPLE WILL BEGIN DOING IN
AMERICA WHAT THEY DO EVERY
YEAR-- SPENDING ABOUT $2 BILLION
ON EASTER CANDY.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
SIR.
POLITICS SHOULD BE LIKE EASTER
CANDY.
FOR SALE EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK
SURROUNDED BY FAKE GRASS-ROOTS
AND HIDDEN FROM THE LITTLE
PEOPLE UNTIL THAT SPECIAL DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
ALSO, REALLY ONLY FOR
CHRISTIANS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT EVER SINCE... EVER SINCE I
GAVE UP MY SUPERPAC I HAVE BEGUN
TO QUESTION THE INFLUENCE OF
SUPERPACS.
AND, FOLKS, I'M NOT ALONE.
LAST NIGHT THE CANDIDATES
SQUARED OFF IN MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH MEANS THE
2012 REPUBLICAN DEBATES HAVE NOW
OFFICIALLY PASSED THE SIMPSONS
FOR THE MOST EPISODES IN T.V.
HISTORY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
AND, FOLKS, THESE SUPERPACS ARE
TEARING THE G.O.P. APART.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S SUPERPAC
HAS PUT AN AD OUT THERE
SUGGESTING THAT I VOTED TO ALLOW
FELONS TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR
PRISON.
>> I HAVEN'T SPOKEN WITH ANY OF
THE PEOPLE INVOLVE WITH MY
SUPERPAC IN MONTHS.
>> BOTH SENATOR SANTORUM AND I
HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT GOVERNOR
ROMNEY'S SUPERPAC OVER WHICH HE
APPARENTLY HAS NO INFLUENCE
WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH
INFLUENCE HE'D HAVE IF HE WERE
PRESIDENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SUPERPAC ADS THAT ARE INACCURATE
YOU HAVE A SUPERPAC ADD THAT
ATTACKS ME.
JUST HOLD ON.
THAT ATTACKS ME.
IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST HOAX
SINCE BIG FOOT.
>> I SAID PUBLICLY IT OUGHT TO
BE ED TED AND PUT ONLY THE
CORRECT FACTS IN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THESE GUYS ARE
VICTIMS GETTING BLAMED FOR
NEGATIVE SUPERPAC ADS THEY ARE
POWERLESS TO STOP.
MEANWHILE, WHY ARE THEIR
OPPONENTS PRETENDING TO BE
POWERLESS TO STOP ALL THESE
NEGATIVE SUPERPAC ADS?
I KNOW HOW THESE GUYS FEEL
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT YET ANOTHER
SUPERPAC AD MYSTERIOUSLY
SURFACED IN THE SUPPORT OF MY
EXPLORATORY BID FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF SOUTH
CAROLINA.
NOW, I HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS I HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED
THAT I CAN'T GET ON THE PRIMARY
BALLOT AND BEING ON THE
BALLOT...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
I KNOW, I KNOW, FOLKS.
BEING ON THE BALLOT IS ONE OF
THE LEADING WAYS TO GAUGE
WHETHER VOTERS WOULD VOTE FOR
YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SOMEONE WHOSE VALUES I
DEEPLY SHARE IS ON THE BALLOT.
FORMER CANDIDATE AND FUTURE
"CELEBRITY APPRENTICE"
CONTESTANT HERMAN CAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
SO LAST NIGHT I TOLD MY VIEWERS
THAT IF HERMAN CAIN WERE TO DO
WELL IN THIS SATURDAY'S PRIMARY
I WOULD INTERPRET THAT AS A CALL
FOR ME TO FORMALLY DECLARE THAT
I AM RUNNING.
AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE THE
DEFINITELY NOT COORDINATING WITH
STEPHEN COLBERT SUPERPAC RUN BY
MY SHADOWY FRIEND JON STEWART
RAN THIS AD IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
ARE FRUSTRATED.
IT'S LESS THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE
ELECTION AND THERE'S STILL NO
CANDIDATE FOR US.
PLUS, THE ECONOMY.
THANKFULLY, THERE IS ONE NAME ON
THE BALLOT THAT STANDS FOR TRUE
AMERICAN VALUES.
HERMAN CAIN.
AMERICANS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
TOMORROW BELIEVE A VOTE FOR
HERMAN CAIN IS A VOTE FOR
AMERICA.
HE'S NOT A CAREER POLITICIAN,
HE'S SUCH A WASHINGTON OUTSIDER
HE'S NOT EVEN RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
SEND THEM A MESSAGE.
ON JANUARY 21, VOTE HERMAN CAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AMERICANS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
TOMORROW ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CONTENT OF THIS ADVERTISEMENT.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I HAVE NO
IDEA HOW THEY GOT THAT FOOTAGE
OF ME INTERVIEWING POTENTIAL
RUNNING MATES.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT TO SOME IN THE MEDIA THIS
SMELLS FISHY.
LIKE FORMER POLITICO POLITICAL
COLUMNIST IN AND CURRENT BUZZ
FEED BUZZ KILL BEN SMITH WHO
ASKS "STEPHEN COLBERT BEGINS
TAPING AROUND 7:30 P.M. AND HE
DETAILS HIS VOTE CAIN STRATEGY
ON LAST NIGHT'S SHOW.
MEANWHILE THE COLBERT SUPERPAC
RELEASED A SLICK 60-SECOND VOTE
CAIN AD BEFORE THE "THE COLBERT
REPORT" EPISODE EVEN HIT THE
AIR.
HOW DID BOTH PRODUCTION
INTENSIVE VIDEO SEGMENTS GET
MADE WITHIN HOURS OF EACH OTHER
WITHOUT ILLEGAL COORDINATION?"
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT THE
COLBERT SUPERPAC, IT'S THE
DEFINITELY NOT COORDINATING WITH
STEPHEN COLBERT SUPERPAC.
GET YOUR NAMES RIGHT, BILL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE CHECKED YOUR MATH AND THE
AD DID AIR BEFORE MY SHOW SO HOW
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
WELL, FOLKS, THERE ARE A CUP
COUPLE POSSIBILITIES.
IT COULD BE THAT AFTER SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER AT "THE
DAILY SHOW" JON AND I HAVE
DEVELOPED SOME KIND OF PSYCHIC
TWIN CONNECTION WHERE ONE FEELS
WHERE WHAT THE OTHER IS
EXPERIENCING.
LIKE LUKE SKYWALKER AND PRINCESS
LEIA.
I'M PRINCESS LEIA IN THIS
SCENARIO.
(LAUGHTER)
AND... (SCREAMING)
I'M FEELING SOMETHING FROM JON
RIGHT NOW.
NO, JON!
NO, DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON THAT
HOT STOVE!
(SCREAMING)
(APPLAUSE)
I BET THAT WOULD TASTE GREAT
WITH SOME RANCH DRESSING.
ANYWAY, FOLKS, THERE IS ONE
OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR
THIS MYSTERY.
JON TOLD ME WHAT HE WAS GOING TO
DO.
YOU SEE, IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL.
ACCORDING TO FORMER F.E.C.
CHAIRMAN AND MY AND JOHN'S
LAWYER TREVOR POTTER.
EVIDENTLY NON-COORDINATING JUST
MEANS I CAN'T HELP THEM OR
APPROVE WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
BUT I CAN KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT
THEY'VE DONE.
THAT'S NOT COORDINATING, THAT'S
JUST ORDINATING.
(LAUGHTER)
INFORMATION CAN GO ONE WAY BUT
NOT THE OTHER.
IT'S A ONE-WAY MEMBRANE.
BASICALLY A MONEY PLACENTA.
I GIVE HIM NOTHING AND JOHN
NOURISHES ME IN A WARM AMNIOTIC
BATH OF STRATEGY AND CASH UNTIL
I SLIDE OUT ALL WET AND
ELECTABLE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
ALL TRUE.
ALL TRUE.
WE CHECKED.
JOHN AND I DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE
PSYCHIC.
OH, GOD!
I'M GOTING ANOTHER ONE!
(SCREAMING)
SOMEONE'S TICKLING JON.
QUIT IT, JOHN OLIVER!
QUIT IT!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
STOP TICKLING HIM!
STOP IT!
