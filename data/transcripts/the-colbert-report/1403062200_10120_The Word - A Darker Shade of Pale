NOW, NATION, MY SOCCER TEAMISN'T THE ONLY REASON I'M
FEELING LIKE A WINNER.
ONE WEEK AGO TODAY HOUSEMAJORITY LEADER AND LENSCRAFTERS
MODEL UNDERSTUDY ERIC CANTORLOST HIS PRIMARY RACE TO AN
UNKNOWN TEA PARTIER, DAVID BRAT.
NOW THAT CANTOR IS OUT ASMAJORITY LEADER, CONSERVATIVES
HAVE ALREADY STARTED THE RACE TOREPLACE HIM.
MY PREDICTION FOR THAT RACE:WHITE.
BUT, FOLKS, CANTOR'S DOWNFALLHIGHLIGHTS A PROBLEM FOR THE
RNC.
>> HIS SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRATIONREFORM IS THE KEY REASON BEHIND
HIS DEFEAT.
>> VOTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT IFERIC CANTOR WENT BACK TO
WASHINGTON, THAT WAS A GREENLIGHT FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> ERIC CANTOR WAS ACCUSED OFRUSHING TOWARDS A REFORM PROGRAM
THAT HIS OPPONENT LABELED"AMNESTY."
>> Stephen: YES, HE SUPPORTEDAMNESTY.
YOU MESS WITH THE BULL, YOU GETTHE HORNS, AND I WANT TO BE
CLEAR, THAT'S A RODEO BULLMETAPHOR, NOT A BULL-FIGHTING
METAPHOR.
I WANT TO KEEP MY JOB.
SADLY, IT TURNS OUT A LOT OF THEMATADORS HAVE BEEN VOTING.
>> YOU HAVE HISPANICS, YOU KNOW,VOTING IN LARGER AND LARGER
NUMBERS.
>> IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ISGOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN
ELECTING A PRESIDENTIALCANDIDATE IN 2016, THEY'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO APPEALTO HISPANIC VOTERS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL TICKETWITH HISPANIC APPEAL, LIKE TED
CRUZ AND SOMEBODY APPEALING?
WE'LL WORK ON IT.
WE'LL WORK ON IT.
[APPLAUSE]FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THERE IS A
WAY FOR THE GRAND OLD PARTY TOWIN OVER HISPANICS WITHOUT
BECOMING UN GRANDE' EL POLLO'.
AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OFTONIGHT'S "WORD."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]A DARKER SHADE OF PALE.
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES MAY NOTPOLL WELL WITH HISPANICS, BUT
THERE IS ONE GROUP WHO HASALWAYS GIVEN THEM SUPPORT.
AND THAT GROUP IS WHITE GUYS.
IN FACT, IN 2012, 62% OF WHITEMEN VOTED FOR MITT ROMNEY.
THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS SHOULDHAVE LED TO AN AWKWARD,
REGRETTABLE VICTORY DANCE, BUTTHERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE
G.O.P. IT TURNS OUT THAT A STUDYBY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER OF
THE LAST U.S. CENSUS ANALYZEDTHE RESPONSES TO TWO KEY
QUESTIONS: ONE, ARE YOU OFHISPANIC, LATINO OR SPANISH
ORIGIN, AND, TWO, WHAT IS YOURRACE?
NOW, THOSE TWO QUESTIONS MIGHTSEEM REALLY SIMILAR, SO THE
ANSWERS ARE KIND OF TRICKY.
>> SO WHEN THE PEW PEOPLESTUDIED THE ANSWERS, THEY
NOTICED SOMETHING INTERESTING.
2.5 MILLION AMERICANS WHOIDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS
HISPANIC AND SOME OTHER RACE IN2000, TEN YEARS LATER,
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES ASHISPANIC AND WHITE, MEANING
HISPANICS ARE VOLUNTARILYBECOMING WHITE.
THEY'RE SAYING, ADIOS, CINCO DEMAYO, AND HELLO, CINCO DE
MAYO.
AND I DO NOT BLAME HISPANICS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DO NOTBLAME HISPANICS FOR BECOMING
WHITE.
YOU SEE, WHITE PEOPLE, WHITEPEOPLE GET TO LIVE IN THE BEST
NEIGHBORHOODS, GET THE BESTJOBS, APPROPRIATE THE BEST
MUSIC.
AND I BELIEVE THIS PROVES THATBEING WHITE IS A CHOICE.
ONE I MAKE EVERY DAY.
IT SHOWS IN THE WAY I DRESS, THEWAY I DANCE, THE WAY I OWN A
BOAT.
SO I SPEAK FOR ALL PEOPLE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR ALL WHITE
PEOPLE WHEN I SAY, "WELCOME,TRANS-CAUCASIANS."
I MYSELF AM CIS-WHITE.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN COMFORTABLEWITH MY BIRTH RACE, BUT THERE IS
ROOM FOR ALL OF YOU IN THE WHITECOMMUNITY.
AND HERE'S THE THING, YOU ARENOT ALONE.
HISPANICS ARE JUST THE LATESTIMMIGRANT GROUP TO BECOME WHITE.
I MEAN, THESE DAYS MANY PEOPLEEVEN CONSIDER ITALIANS TO BE
WHITE.
BUT WE CANNOT... I BELIEVE ASA NATION WE CANNOT STOP AT
HISPANICS.
THE G.O.P. IS A TENT BIG ENOUGHFOR ANYONE WILLING TO CALL
THEMSELVES WHITE -- ASIANS,INDIANS, BLACKS, WHATEVER BRUNO
MARS IS.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]OF COURSE, WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO
IT, REPUBLICANS DON'T STRUGGLEONLY WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES.
THEY ALSO STRUGGLE WITH GENDERMAJORITIES.
LIKE IN 2012 WHEN 55% OF WOMENVOTED FOR OBAMA.
SO, LADIES, YOU ARE WELCOME TOJOIN US, TOO.
ALL YOU HAVE DO IS IDENTIFY ASMALE, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS THE
WHITE OF GENDERS.
AND ONCE EVERYONE STARTS SEEINGTHEMSELVES AS WHITE MALES,
CONSERVATIVES CAN APPEAL TO THEMBY POINTING OUT THAT THEY ARE
UNDER ATTACK FROM THE PEOPLETHEY USED TO BE.
THEY'LL KNOW WHICH SIDE THEIRBREAD IS BUTTERED ON.
SO PLEASE, JOIN US, HISPANICS,BECAUSE ONCE EVERYONE IS WHITE,
THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING TO FIGHTOVER.
AND THAT'S "THE WORD."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
