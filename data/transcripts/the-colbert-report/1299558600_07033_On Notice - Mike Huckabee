(LAUGHTER)
NATION, I'M ALSO PRETTY UP
SET ABOUT RECENT COMMENTS BY
FRIEND OF THE SHOW MIKE
HUCKABEE.
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID TO
FAMED CONSERVATIVE FILM
CRITIC AND MUSTACHE HOST
ORGANISM MICHAEL MEDVED.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S
TROUBLING IS THAT PEOPLE SEE
A NATALIE PORTMAN OR SOME
OTHER HOLLYWOOD STARLET WHO
BOASTS OF HEY, LOOK, YOU
KNOW WE'RE HAVING CHILDREN.
WE'RE NOT MARRIED BUT WE'RE
HAVING THESE CHILDREN AND WE
ARE DOING JUST FINE.
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
GOVERNOR?
LOOK, I'M NO FAN OF SINGLE
MOTHERS EITHER, BUT IT'S
NATALIE PORTMAN WE'RE
TALKING BEING.
THAT KID SHE'S PREGNANT WITH
IS LUKE SKYWALKER!
LAUGH 4R56--
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO I MEAN
LOGICALLY IF ARE YOU AGAINST
HER PREGNANCY THAT MEANS YOU
HAVE ALIGNED YOURSELF
POLITICALLY WITH EM PERER
PALPATINE.
YOU'RE ALIENATED ALL OF
TATAOUINE.
IT'S A SWING PLANET.
AND THIS IS JUST THE LATEST,
HE ALSO DROPPED THIS
HUCKABOMB ABOUT OBAMA'S
CHILDHOOD ON NEW YORK'S WOR
RADIO.
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
HIS PERSPECTIVE AS GROWING
UP IN KENYA WITH A KENYAN
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER,
THEIR VIEW OF THE MAO MAO
REVOLUTION IN KENYA IS VERY
DIFFERENT THAN OURS.
BECAUSE HE PROBABLY GREW UP
HEARING THAT THE BRITISH
WERE A BUNCH OF IMPERIALISTS
WHO PERSECUTED HIS
GRANDFATHER.
>> Stephen: OH, NOW, IN CASE
MISSED IT, HE SAID OBAMA
GREW UP IN KENYA WITH HIS
KENYAN FATHER, KENYA, KENYA,
KENYA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: MY FEELINGS
ABOUT THIS, FOLKS, I GOT TO
SAY ARE COMPLICATED.
FIRST OFF, OBAMA DIDN'T GROW
UP IN KENYA.
HE WAS BORN IN KENYA, BEFORE
MOVING TO ISLAM A STAND
WHERE HE THEN TRAVELED BACK
IT TIME TO PLANT HIS BIRTH
ANNOUNCEMENT IN A HAWAIIAN
NEWSPAPER.
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE
GOVERNOR'S POINT.
THE KENYAN VIEW OF THE MAO
MAO REVOLUTION IS FAR
DIFFERENT THAN THE AMERICAN
VIEW.
WHICH IS GENERALLY WHAT IS
THE MAO MAO REVOLUTION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW I--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THE
ANSWER TO THAT, BUT I DO
KNOW WE MUST DEFEND THE
SULTAN OF ZAN ZA BAR OR
BRING HIM DOWN-- ZANZIBAR,
OR BRING HIM DOWN, EITHER
WAY, LAND AND FREEDOM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YEAH, WE'RE
PASSIONATE IT ABOUT IT.
BUT AFTER BEING CALLED OUT
FOR THE INACCURACY HUCKABEE
TOOK PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
BY SENDING SOMEONE ELSE TO
ADMIT HE WAS WRONG, SAYING
GOVERNOR HUCKABEE SIMPLY
MISSPOKE WHEN HE ALLUDED TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA GROWING UP
IN KENNIA.
THE GOVERNOR MEANT TO SAY
THE PRESIDENT GREW NEWSPAPER
INDONESIA.
OKAY?
HE SIMPLY MISSPOKE.
FOR FIVE MINUTES.
ABOUT THE MAO MAO REVOLUTION,
WHICH HE EVIDENTLY THOUGHT
HAPPENED IN INDONESIA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THE IMPORTANT
THING ISN'T WHERE THE MAO
MAO REVOLUTION HAPPENED, THE
IMPORTANT THING IS FOR
PEOPLE TO START ASSOCIATING
BARACK OBAMA WITH THE WORD
MAO MAO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AFTER ALL,
WHEREVER NOT IN THE UNITED
STATES THE PRESIDENT GREW UP,
HE HAD A DIFFERENT CHILDHOOD.
AS HUCKABEE CLARIFIED.
>> I'VE SAID MANY TIMES
PUBLICLY THAT I DO THINK HE
HAS A DIFFERENT WORLDVIEW.
AND I THINK IT'S IN PART
MOLDED OUT OF A VERY
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE, MOST
OF US GREW UP GOING TO BOY
SCOUT MEETING, NOT MADRASES.
DOES THIS PRESIDENT HAVE A
DIFFERENT WORLDVIEW THAN ANY
OTHER PRESIDENT IN THE
HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES?
>> Stephen: YES.
I KNOW MY WORLDVIEW WAS
PERMANENTLY SET AT AGE 7.
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THE
GREATEST THREAT FACINGING
THIS NATION IS MY MOTHER
VACUUMING UP OUR LINCOLN
LOGS.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
SDZ NOW HUCKABEE'S-- .
>> Stephen: NOW HUCKABEE'S
COMMENTS TICKED ME OFF, NOT
BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH HIM,
FOLKS, BUT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
MAKE THEM WHEN HE WAS ON MY
SHOW JUST ONE WEEK AGO.
WHEN HE WAS HERE, HE GAVE ME
NOTHING.
COME ON, GOVERNOR, I AM ON
YOUR SIDE.
I WANT THE JUICY STUFF YOU
GIVE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THIS
BOLD STATEMENT YOU MADE ON
GAY MARRIAGE.
>> THE IDEAL WORLD IS A MAN
AND A WOMAN.
YOU DON'T GO AHEAD AND
ACCOMMODATE EVERY WE
HEAV-- BEHALF YARROL PATTERN
IS THENCE THE IDEAL.
THAT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO
BELIEVE IN INCEST SO WE
SHOULD ACCOMMODATE THEM.
>> Stephen: YES, GAY
MARRIAGE AND INCEST ARE
BASICALLY THE SAME THING.
THAT'S WESTBOROUGH BAPTIST
CHURCH TERRITORY.
THAT'S THE RED MEAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.
BY THE WAY, WE SHOULDN'T LET
GAY PEOPLE MARRY RED MEAT
EITHER.
BUT WHEN YOU WERE HERE, ALL
YOU GAVE ME WAS THIS.
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN REALLY JUST THE KIND
OF MUSLIMS THAT LIVE IN YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY'RE
GREAT CITIZENS AND JIHADDISTS,
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN CHRISTIANS WHO ARE
NICE PEOPLE AND THE ONES WHO
LIKE THE WESTBOROUGH BAPTIST
CHURCH WHO ARE A BUNCH OF
LOONS.
>> Stephen: WHAT A STEAMING
PILING OF REASONABLE.
I'M SORRY, SIR, UNTIL YOU
COME ON MY SHOW AND SAY
SOMETHING THAT WILL GET YOU
SOME UNWANTED NOTICE, I AM
PUTTING ON NOTICE.
BRING IT OUT, BOYS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY, SIR,
BUT YOU BROUGHT THIS ON
YOURSELF.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT
HERE.
LET'S SEE.
M, M, M, MANDRELS, MARZIPAN,
MESCALIN, TABS OF.
HERE WE GO, MIKE HUCKABEE.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, GOVERNOR, BRACE
YOURSELF.
SEEIA, WOULDN'T WANT TO
HUCKABEEIA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOW'S THAT TASTE, GOVERNOR.
IS THAT ON YOUR DIET?
THERE YOU ARE, AND YOU'RE
NOT COMING OFF NOTICE UNTIL
YOU COME ON MY SHOW AND
RECKLESSLY MISSPEAK.
AND I WANT IT TO BE
SOMETHING GOOD, LIKE BARACK
OBAMA IS THE FORGOTTEN
POINTER SISTER, OR MICHELLE
OBAMA IS A TOOTHLESS CARNIE
WHO SELLS METH BEHIND THE
ZIPPER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND YOU KNOW
WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, SIR?
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAKES IT A
LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE,
FEEL FREE TO THROW IN A
KENYA, HERE, A
