SMELLS.
NOW, NATION--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I HAVE HEARD-- THEY ARE CLAPPING
WITH ANGER!
NATION, I'VE HEARD THAT IF YOU
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE SAY,
DON'T SAY IT AT ALL.
THE GUY WHO TOLD ME THAT WAS AN
IDIOT.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AMERICA'S
WILD RUSH FOR WIND POWER, GUSTY
GOLD THE BUBBLIN' BREEZE.
WELL, NOW THAT RUSH HAS CLAIMED
INNOCENT LIVES.
>> IT'S A FEDERAL CRIME TO KILL
THE GOLDEN EAGLE.
GOT THAT.
ABOUT ONCE A MONTH A GOLDEN
EAGLE IT KILLED BY A WINDATURE
BY.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS WHEN I SEE
THE MAJESTIC CREATURES
SENSELESSLY CUT DOWN IN THEIR
PRIME ALL I CAN SAY IS IN YOUR
FACE, TREE HUGGERS!
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU'RE UNDER THAT
TREE.
BECAUSE IT'S RAINING DEAD
EAGLES.
IT IS TIME YOU SMUG ECO-NUTS
LEARN THERE IS NO MAGICAL FUEL
SOURCE THAT DOESN'T HAVE CURSED,
MONKEY PAW-LIKE CONSEQUENCES,
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, THE CURSED
MONKEY-POWERED CAR.
IT'S FOOL PROOF-- IF YOU'RE
STUCK IN TRAFFIC, JUST PET THE
PAW AND THE ROADS WILL CLEAR BUT
YOU CAN'T SEE THE ROAD BECAUSE
YOUR GLASS BROKEN AND YOU'LL
NEVER BE ABLE TO READ ALL THOSE
BOOKS!
DAMN YOU!
THAT'S WHY I'M ISSUING A FIRM
WAG OF MY MAN PAW AT WIND
TURBINES, OR AS I NOW CALL THEM,
EAGLE GRINDERS.
( LAUGHTER )
THE WORST PART IS THEY ARE
GETTING AWAY WITH SKY MURDER
BECAUSE WHILE THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROSECUTED
OIL COMPANIES, WHEN BIRDS DROWN
IN WASTE PITS, AND POWER
COMPANIES WHEN BIRDS ARE
ELECTROCUTED BY POWER LINES,
THEY HAVE NEVER PROSECUTED A
WIND ENERGY COMPANY.
>> AND KNOW WHY.
IF A POLITICIAN SAID I WILL CALL
A HEARING TO BREAK BIG OIL,
EVERYBODY CHEERS.
BUT IF YOU SHOUT, "I WILL BREAK
BIG WIND," THEY JUST LAUGH AT
YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
AND THE WIND LOBBY'S MASSIVE
INFLUENCE LED ONE FORMER U.S.
FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AGENT
TO SAY IF YOU ELECTROCUTE AN
EAGLE, THAT IS BAD.
BUT IF YOU CHOP IT TO PIECES,
THAT IS OKAY.
AND IF YOU DICE IT AND THROW IT
IN A WORK WITH A SOY GINGER
SAUCE, THAT IS HEAVENLY.
NOT THAT I'VE DONE THAT.
AND IF I HAVE, I WORK FOR A WIND
COMPANY.
NEXTUM ON THE T-WAGS, IT'S NO
SECRET THAT CHINA IS EMERGING AS
A SUPERPOWER TO BE RECKONED
WITH.
I MEAN, IF THEIR DEAD PEOPLE CAN
PLAY FOOTBALL AND CONDUCT
ORCHESTRAS, IMAGINE WHAT THEIR
LIVE ONES CAN DO.
AND, FOLKS, A RECENT NEWS STORY
PROVED THAT CHINA'S QUEST FOR
INFLUENCE KNOWS NO BOUNDS.
>> CHINA HAS LAUNCHED A MIDDLE
EAST PEACE PROPOSAL DURING
VISITS FROM THE LEADERS OF
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY IN A SIGN OF BEIJING'S
DESIRE FOR A LARGER ROLE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, CHINESE LEADER HI
JIN PING LAUNCHED A POWER-POINT
PEACE PROPOSAL CALL FOR AN
INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE,
ALONGSIDE ISRAEL.
>> Stephen:  CHINAMENTS IN ON
MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKING, AND IT
COULD WORK.
THEY ARE EXPERTS AT GETTING
LONGTIME ENEMIES TO EXIST SIDE
BY SIDE.
JUST LOOK AT BEEF AND BROCCOLI.
( LAUGHTER )
AND THAT IS WHY TONIGHT, I AM
ISSUING A WAG OF MY FINGER AT
CHINA.
LISTEN UP, COMRADES!
BROKERING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE
EAST IS AMERICA'S JOB.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PLANS
ARE, BUT, PLEASE, DON'T TAKE
OVER OUR ROLE AS MIDDLE EAST
PEACEMAKER.
I MEAN, WE LOVE PUTTING OUR
POLITICS AND OUR INTERNATIONAL
REPUTATION RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE
OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF
MISTRUST AND HATRED.
OH!
OH!
AND WE'RE SO CLOSE, TOO.
I MEAN, WE'VE REALLY-- WE'VE
REALLY WARMED UP THAT OLD HOLLY
LAND SLOT MACHINE.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST ABOUT READY TO
PAY OUT IN NOBEL PRIZES.
IF YOU JUMP IN NOW, YOU'LL GET
ALL THE CREDIT, AND-- AND OUR
AFEXATE NICKNAME, THE GREAT
SATAN.
PLUS ALL THE FREE EFFIGIES WILL
YOU CAN BURN.
BUT I GUESS YOU GUYS WIN.
TAKE THE MIDDLE EAST.
WE'LL BE OVER HERE PAINTING
AFGHANISTAN.
IT SURE IS FUN.
( LAUGHTER )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
