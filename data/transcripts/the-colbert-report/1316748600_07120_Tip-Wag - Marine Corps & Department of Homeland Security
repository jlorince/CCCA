TRILLION.
(LAUGHTER)
SO NATION, I ALWAYS SAY DO
AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO.
UNLESS WHAT I AM DOING IS
SAYING DO WHAT I DO, IN
WHICH CASE DO AS I SAY.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG
OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, A VERY RARE WAG OF
MY FINGER AT THE MARINES.
NOW ORDINARILY-- I KNOW, I
KNOW.
ORDINARILY I AM 1,000
PERCENT BEHIND THE
LEATHERNECKS.
BUT THE CORPS HAS ISSUED A
HARSH NEW RESTRICTION.
BANNING MARINES FROM AUDIBLE
FARTING BECAUSE IT OFFENDS
THE AFGHANS.
(LAUGHTER)
OUR TROOPS, OUR TROOPS ARE
OUT THERE RISKING THEIR
LIVES FOR OUR FREEDOM.
WE OWE THEM THE FREEDOM TO
UNLEASH A LOUD, PROUD, CHEEK
RATTLING TEAR SCORCHING.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT, WHAT-- WHAT DID THE
MARINES WANT THE MEN ON THE
GROUND TO DO, BE SILENT BUT
DEADLY?
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT SOUNDS
LIKE TERRORISM TO ME.
BESIDES, IT'S JUST CRUEL.
WE CANNOT FILL THESE
SOLDIERS WITH MREs THEN ASK
THEM TO CEASE-FIRE ON THEIR
ENDLESS TOURS OF DUTY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I'M GOING TO LET THAT
ONE SINK IN.
NOW FOLKS, I UNDERSTAND WE
HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO
LOCAL CUSTOMS.
THE AFGHANS ARE RENOWNED FOR
THEIR CIVILITY AND DECORUM.
THEY ALWAYS SAY PLEASE AND
THANK YOU BEFORE BURYING AN
ADULT RES ALIVE AT THE HALF
TIME DURING A GAME OF GOAT
HEAD POLO.
BUT I SAY THERE IS NOTHING
IN THIS WORLD MORE PATRIOTIC
THAN A MARINE FART.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVERYBODY ON YOUR FEET, ON
YOUR FEET.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AN HATS OFF, HANDS OVER YOUR
HEARTS.
JIMMY, LET FREEDOM-- FREEDOM
RING.
(FARTING SOUNDS).
>> Stephen: NOW I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, I DON'T KNOW BUT
YOU FOLKS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BUT THAT BROUGHT
A TEAR TO MY EYE.
(LAUGHTER)
NEXT UP, I HAVE LONG SAID
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS
BOSCHING HOMELAND SECURITY.
FIRST, THEY INTRODUCED THE
FULL BODY NAKED SCANNER THEN
REFUSE TO PRINT OUT WALLET
SIZE COPIES ON REQUEST.
WHY AM I DOING CRUNCHES.
EVEN I WAS SHOCKED BY THEIR
LATEST AIRPORT SECURITY
MEASURE.
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SKOOURT SAYS IT'S
CHANGING THE SCREENING
POLICY FOR CHILDREN UNDER
THE AGE OF 12.
>> THE MOST NOTICEABLE
CHANGE FOR THE 12 AND UNDER
SET IS THAT THEY CAN KEEP
THEIR SHOES ON AT CHECK
POINTS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
12 AND UNDER CAN KEEP THEIR
SHOES ON.
SO EVIDENTLY TERRORISM
BEGINS AT PUBERTY.
ON THE SURFACE THIS MAKES
SENSE.
THAT'S WHEN THEY START
GROWING BEARDS,
EXPERIMENTING WITH HARMFUL
CHEMICALS, AND SPENDING
HOURS IN THEIR SLEEPER
CELLS.
GOD KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON
IN THERE.
BUT I AM STILL GIVING A WAG
OF MY FINGER TO THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY BECAUSE LETTING
KIDS KEEP THEIR SHOES ON
IGNORES THE MOST DANGEROUS
THREAT OF ALL, THE TERRORIST
TOOs TWOs.
EVERYONE KNOWS A CRYING
TODDLER CAN TAKE AN ENTIRE
AIRPLANE HOSTAGE.
IF THEIR PARENTS TRY TO TELL
THEM TO SETTLE DOWN, THEY
OFTEN RESPOND IN WHAT SOUNDS
A LOT LIKE ARABIC.
FOLKS-- NOW LOOK HOW EASY IT
WILL BE FOR TERRORISTS TO
GAME THE NEW SYSTEM.
COME ON IN, MOM.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT IS GOING
TO HAPPEN.
HERE WE GO.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HELLO!
I AM A CHILD ON MY WAY TO
THE DISNEY PLACE.
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME FLYING
ON BOEING 767 WIDE-BODY JET
WITH 400 ER WING EXTENSION.
I WOULD LIKE TO SIT NEAR THE
WEAKEST PART OF THE FUSELAGE
WITH MY MOTHER AND MY SHOES.
>> Stephen: YOU SEE, IT'S
THAT EASY, FOLKS.
IT'S THAT EASY.
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
