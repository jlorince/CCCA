THIS TIME FROM INSIDE THE GOAL.
[LAUGHTER]
SO WILL CORRUPTION DESTROY SOCCER?
HERE TO MOVE THE DISCUSSION FORWARD WITHOUT USING HIS HANDS, PLEASE WELCOME FORMER U.S.
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER AND ESPN SOCCER ANALYST, ALEXEI LALAS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT ALEXI, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, THIS IS THIS IT FOR SOCKER IS?
IS IT A KILLING BLOW TO THE WORLD'S MOST FAVORITE SPORT?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
>> Stephen: WHY NOT IT'S CORRUPT YOU CAN'T TRUST A SINGLE GAME.
IT'S A SHAM.
IT'S THEATER.
IT MIGHT AS WELL BE WRESTLING AT THIS POINT.
>> IT'S IN THE A SHAM.
IT'S HUGE AND VERY IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen: SO IS WRESTLING.
>> IT'S IMPORTANT IT BE DEALT WITH.
WHEN THESE THINGS COME OUT.
FIXING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BUT WE'RE TALKING IN EUROPE, CENTRAL AMERICA AND
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE UNITED STATES DO WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF FIXING IN THE UNITED STATES?
>> WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE U.S.
MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER IS CLEAN AND MAYBE IN THAT SENSE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE.
>> Stephen: HOW WOULD SOMEBODY FIX A GAME?
HOW?
>> I GUARANTEE I'VE PLAYED IN A FIXED GAME.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MING IN IT AND FIXING A GAME.
YOU DON'T NEED A LOT TO DO IT.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE REFEREE.
IT'S PLAYERS, PLAYERS ON THE FIELD AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FIXER, A GUY WITH RELATIONSHIP
WITH PLAYERS, AN E-PLAYER, A GUY WHO IS BITTER, NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.
A REFEREE OR MERES MAKING A COUPLE HOW TO AND SAY HEY, YOU CAN MAKE $50,000 IT'S DIFFICULT
TO PASS UP.
>> Stephen: WHO IS POLICING?
FIFA?
>> THEY CAN DO ONLY SO MUCH.
THEY NEED THE HELP OF THE POLICE IN THE COUNTRIES.
THIS IS ALL ALWAYS WE TALK ABOUT ASIA AND SINGAPORE WHICH VERY IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen: ONE GUY IN SINGAPORE.
>> GOTTA GET HIM.
>> Stephen: HE'S FIXING GAMES ALL OVER THE WORLD.
>> THERE'S AN INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR HIM NEXT SUMMER IS THE WORLD CUP AND GOD
FORBID WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WORLD CUP NEXT SUMMER SAYING AH.
ONCE YOU ARE TAINTED IT'S DIFFICULT.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY ARE VIGILANT ABOUT.
THIS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T CREEP TO THE U.S.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU TRUST ANYTHING ABOUT A GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE ROUTINELY SLAPPING
EACH OTHER IN THE FACE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S HANDS.
>> DON'T BE A BOOB, STEVE.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE A BOOB.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
OH, OW!
NO ONE GOING TO CALL THAT?
LISTEN, I DON'T HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT VIEW OF SOCCER I PITY YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTIFUL GAME IT'S NUANCE.
IT'S SUBJECTIVE.
IT TAKES SUPERIOR INTELLECT TO UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTY OF GAME EVEN THE THEATRICS WE SEE OUT THERE.
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S OKAY.
I AM NOT ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU
[AUDIENCE REACTS [.
>> Stephen: IT'S FINE.
MAYBE SOME GUY WILL UNDERSTAND THE JOY.
YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT.
>> Stephen:LY NEVER RISE TO THE LEVEL OF APPRECIATING 0-0 THE EXCITEMENT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
>> ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: ESPN
