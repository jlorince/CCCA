WASHING THE OTHER.
WELL, FOLKS, YOU KNOW IF
KARL IS IN, SO AM I.
SO HERE TO TELL ME HOW
COLBERT SUPERPAC CAN ADOPT
KARL ROVE'S TACTICS OF
ADOPTING BEN NELSON'S TACTIC
PLEASE WELCOME FORMER HEAD
OF THE SEC, GENERAL COUNSEL
TO THE McCAIN CAMPAIGN AND
MY PERSONAL LAWYER, TREVOR
POTTER.
TREVOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING HERE.
(APPLAUSE)
THESE BEN NELSON ISSUE ADS
AND THE KIND OF ADS KARL
WANTS TO RUN THEY ARE NOT
CAMPAIGN ADS, RIGHT.
THEY ARE JUST ISSUE ADS THAT
HAPPEN TO HAVE THE CANDIDATE
IN THEM, WHO IS CAMPAIGNING
FOR OFFICE.
JUST, JUST, JUST BECAUSE
BECAUSE-- SOMEONE IS IN MY
AD DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE
COORDINATING WITH THEIR
CAMPAIGN.
ANY MORE THAN IF, YOU KNOW,
JUST BECAUSE MY PE NIS IS IN
SOMEONE'S VAGINA, DOESN'T
MEAN WE'RE HAVING SEX--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> RIGHT?
AS LONG AS AT THE END I
SCREAM "I APPROVE THIS
MESSAGE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RIGHT?
SO --.
>> YOU ALLOWED TO HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION.
>> Stephen: ON BASIC CABLE.
SO IS ROVE GOING TO WIN
HERE?
>> HE MAY WELL NOT BECAUSE
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS THE
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
IS DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO
CAMPS.
AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE A
MAJORITY TO APPROVE HIS
REQUEST.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF I HAVE A
CANDIDATE IN MY AD BUT IT
REALLY IS NOT COORDINATED.
LIKE I'VE KIDNAPPED HIM AND
CHLOROFORMED HIM AND HE
WAKES UP IN A VAN AND I HAND
HIM A STATEMENT, HE APP HAS
TO READ IT, IT IS AN ISSUE
HE HAS TO AGREE WITH AND I
RETURN HIM IN TIME TO HIS
FUND-RAISER FOR DESSERT.
WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED
COORDINATION?
>> THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE
BETTER THAN THE FACTS THAN
THE ADVISORY OPINION-- .
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE
SIZING KARL ROVE TO KIDNAP
CANDIDATES.
I UNDERSTAND YOU MUST HAVE
SOME ETHICS OR VALUES.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO
TO GET RID OF THOSE?
>> A LITTLE MORE MONEY,
MAYBE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE A
LAWYER.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
SO TREVOR-- OKAY, TREVOR, I
WANT KARL TO WIN.
WHAT I CAN DO?
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP HIM.
>> WELL, YOU COULD SUBMIT A
LETTER TO THE FEDERAL
ELECTION COMMISSION URGING
THEM TO APPROVE HIS REQUEST
AND EXPLAINING WHY IT WOULD
BE A GOOD THING FOR OTHER
SUPERPACS LIKE YOURS.
>> Stephen: WHERE WOULD I
GET A LETTER LIKE THAT.
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT --
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: ITS HE EVEN ON
THE COLE PERT-- COLBERT
SUPERPAC LETTERHEAD.
ARE YOU GOOD.
THIS IS A LETTER TO THE FEC
SAYING I WANT KARL TO WIN.
AND I DO JUST SIGN HERE.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
JUST SIGN RIGHT THERE.
OKAY.
AND NOW THIS GETS SENT TO
THE FEC AND THIS IS GOING TO
BE THEN ATTACHED TO HIS
REQUEST.
>> RIGHT.
IT WOULD BE PART OF THE
PUBLIC RECORD AND WHEN
THEY'RE LOOKING AT HIS
REQUESTS, THEY WOULD BE
READING YOUR COMMENTS .
>> Stephen: SO WHEN THEY
CONSIDER HIS CASE MY
COMMENTS WILL BE PART OF
THAT CASE.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: WOW.
WELL,.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME, KARL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW I CAN INCLUDE ANY VISUAL
AIDS TO GO WITH THIS,
TREVOR?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: I CAN SO, I CAN
INCLUDE, SAY, MY IDEA OF AN
ISSUE AD INCLUDING A FEDERAL
CANDIDATE, PERHAPS SOMEONE
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT
IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
KIND OF ADS THAT KARL AND I
WANT TO DO.
>> YOU COULD GIVE THEM THAT
AS AN EXAMPLE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I
THINK I WILL.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
HELP ME IN THANKING TREVOR
POTTER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TREVOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
JIMMY, LET'S SHOW THEM THE
KIND OF AD KARL AND I ARE
TALKING ABOUT.
>> HI.
I'M PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
BUDDY ROEMER.
GOD, I WISH I WEREN'T IN
THIS AD.
SEE, I DIDN'T PAY FOR IT.
COLBERT SUPERPAC DID AND
SUPERPACS ARE NOT SUPPOSED
TO COORDINATE WITH
CANDIDATES LIKE ME.
BUT BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE
AD, ABOUT SUPERPACS NOT
COORDINATING WITH CANDIDATES,
I CAN BE IN IT, AS LONG AS I
DON'T SAY, VOTE FOR ME.
SUPERPACS CAN JUSTIFY DOING
ANYTHING THEY WANT AND THEY
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, FOLKS.
THEY BUILT THIS FAKE SET,
WITH FAKE BOOKS.
FILLED WITH REAL MONEY.
HELL, THEY EVEN BOUGHT
COLBERT A UNICORN.
>> Stephen: ALL PERFECTLY
LEGAL.
>> I DID NOT APPROVE THIS
MESSAGE.
>> Stephen: TO NARNIA.
>> THIS MESSAGE-- APPROVED
