>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." PLEASE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I LOST THE EMMY.
(LAUGHTER) SPEAKING OF LOSING, MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER) HE HAS HAD A RUN OF BAD LUCK LATELY AND THIS PAST WEEKEND WAS NO DIFFERENT.
ON SATURDAY, ANN ROMNEY'S PLANE HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING AFTER AN ELECTRICAL FIRE BROKE OUT ON BOARD.
NOW, I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SHE IS FINE.
NO ONE'S SURE WHAT HAPPENED, THOUGH ANN SWEARS SHE SAW A GREMLIN ON THE WING.
(LAUGHTER) AND MITT USED THIS CLOSE CALL TO PRESENT A BOLD IDEA.
>> WHEN YOU HAVE A FIRE IN THE-- IN AN AIRCRAFT, THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO, EXACTLY.
THERE'S NO-- AND YOU CAN'T FIND ANY OXYGEN FROM OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT TO GET IN THE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE THE WINDOWS DON'T OPEN.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T DO THAT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: IT IS A REAL PROBLEM.
(LAUGHTER) FOR ONE THING, IT EXPLAINS WHY BURGER KING DOESN'T HAVE A FLY-THROUGH WINDOW.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS IS REAL LEADERSHIP.
MITT ROMNEY HAS IDENTIFIED A NEW FRONTIER!
JUST AS KENNEDY CHALLENGED US TO PUT A MAN ON THE MOON--
>> WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE AND DO THE OTHER THINGS.
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD!
>> Stephen: YES, AND MITT ROMNEY IS NOW CHALLENGING US TO ADD POW ERWIN DOES TO THE DELTA SHUTTLE!
NOT BECAUSE IT IS EASY BUT BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DID KEN I DO A LOT OF THIS?
I DIDN'T SEE KENNEDY DO A LOT OF THIS.
(LAUGHTER) A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN DO THE VOICE.
DOING THIS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, THE AIR PRESSURE PATROL OUT THERE IS GOING TO SAY THAT ROLLING DOWN THE WINDOW
WILL CAUSE ALL THE PASSENGERS TO GET SUCKED OUT.
WRONG!
OBVIOUSLY HE WILL PUT SCREENS ON THE WINDOWS.
(LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T WANT MOSQ
