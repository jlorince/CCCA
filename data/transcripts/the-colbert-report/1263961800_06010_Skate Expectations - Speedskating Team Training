WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AND ONLY SEE
ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS ON THE
BEACH.
IT'S BECAUSE JESUS BLEW YOUR
LEGS OFF.
AMEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NATION, WE ALL KNOW THESE ARE
HARD ECONOMIC TIMES, ESPECIALLY
FOR NBC.
EVIDENTLY JEFF ZUCKER IS
TRYING TO BURN DOWN THE NETWORK
FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY.
THE ONE THING NBC HAS GOING FOR
THEM IS THE UPCOMING WINTER
OLYMPICS.
IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL MONEY
MAKER, IN THAT THEY WILL LOSE
ONLY $200 MILLION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I, TOO, AM GOING TO VANCOUVER
NEXT MONTH TO REALIZE EVERY
AMERICAN'S DREAM: TO GET INTO
THE OLYMPICS WITHOUT EXERCISING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FIRST, I TRIED OUT FOR THE
SKELETON TEAM.
BUT DESPITE MY GOD-GIVEN TALENT
FOR LYING DOWN AND SURRENDERING
TO THE EFFECTS OF GRAVITY, I WAS
REJECTED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NEXT, BOBSLED.
AGAIN, I DIDN'T MAKE THE TEAM.
APPARENTLY, SOME PEOPLE ARE TOO
PRECIOUS TO GET A LITTLE VOMIT
ON THEIR LYCRA.
FINALLY, I DIDN'T MAKE THE
CURLING TEAM.
THOUGH I DID CURL UP INTO A
PERFECT FETAL POSITION.
AND WHILE I LAY THERE ON THE
ICE, THEN I ASKED MYSELF, WHY AM
I WALKING AWAY FROM MY FIRST
LOVE: SPEED SKATING?
[ LAUGHTER ]
AFTER ALL, THEY'RE SPONSORED BY
YOU THE COLBERT NATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WITHOUT YOUR DONATIONS, THEY
WOULD BE RACING ON BUTTER KNIVES
DUCT-TAPED TO A PAIR OF CHUCK
TAYLORS.
OUR GOAL WAS TO RAISE $300,000.
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH WE RAISED.
JIMMY?
[DRUM ROLL]
OH, $299,993.00!
SO CLOSE.
WELL, WE TRIED.
SORRY, U.S. SPEEDSKATING TEAM,
IT'S TIME TO HANG UP YOUR SKATES
ON THE PEG NEXT TO YOUR HOPES
AND DREAMS.
UNLESS -- WAIT A SECOND!
UNLESS SOME GENEROUS INDIVIDUAL
SWOOPS IN AND SINGLEHANDEDLY
SAVES THE OLYMPICS.
HOLD ON.
LET'S SEE WHAT I GOT HERE.
$7 SHORT HERE, LET'S SEE.
FOUR, FIVE, SIX.
HOLD ON THAT IS SAY PAPER CLIP
THAT IS A GRENADE PIN.
ONE, TWO, THREE, DO YOU BELIEVE
IN MIRACLES?
95 -- 90 -- $300,000.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I DID IT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YES!
I GAVE THE U.S. SPEEDSKATING
TEAM $300,000!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MEANS ON
THIS YEAR'S TAXES, I GET TO
DEDUCT THE COST OF THE OLYMPICS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND NOW THAT I SAVED THE SPORT,
I'M SURE TO MAKE THE SPEED
SKATING TEAM.
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION: WHAT
IS SPEEDSKATING?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TIME FOR MORE OF MY
EXCLUSIVE PRE-LYMPIC COVERAGE.
STEPHEN COLBERT'S SKATE

TAKING DONATIONS ON THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE DOWN THE ICY PATH TO THE
FROZEN ROAD UP TOf "| VANCOUVER 10.
BROUGHT TO YOU BY DR. PEPPER,

MEDICINE.
BUDWEISER, THE ONLY REASON YOU
KNOW WHAT A COLLIDES DALE IS,
AND VERIZON WIRELESS, WIRES ARE
FOR PUSSIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FINE PRODUCTS, ALL.
FOLKS, --
FOLKS, SPEEDSKATING HAS A LONG
AND STORIED PAST.
IT WAS ADDED TO THE WINTER
OLYMPICS IN 1924, AFTER ITS
DISASTROUS SHOWING IN THE 1920
SUMMER OLYMPICS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AMERICA'S MAIN RIVAL IS THE
NETHERLANDS, WHERE SPEEDSKATING
IS THE MOST POPULAR SPORT.
MAINLY BECAUSE IN WINTER WHEN
THE CANALS FREEZE, IT'S THE
FASTEST WAY TO GET FROM YOUR
HOOKER TO YOUR WEED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AMERICA'S BEST HOPE FOR GOLD IS
SHANI DAVIS, WHO BACK IN
DECEMBER, CALLED ME A JERK.
SHANI, NAME-CALLING IS NOT HOW
WE ATHLETES SETTLE OUR
DIFFERENCES.
WE DO IT BY PULLING GUNS ON EACH
OTHER IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

WHEN WE RETURN I ENTER THE
DANGEROUS WORLD OF COMPETITIVE
