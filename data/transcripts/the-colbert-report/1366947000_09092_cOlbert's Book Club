>> Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU, SO MUCH.
PLEASE, HEROES, ALL.
SIT DOWN.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BRING
YOU THE TRUTH RIGHT DOWN THE
TRUTH HOLE.
NATION, FOR YEARS I HAVE ADMIRED
"O," THE OPRAH BOOK CLIB.
AND WHILE LADY "O" AND I ARE
VERY CLOSE, WE'RE ALSO
COMPETITORS.
WE'RE NOT IN SHOW FRIENDSHIP.
WE'RE IN SHOW BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO
INTRODUCE THE START OF MY OWN
BOOK CLUB, C-OH-LBERT BOOK CLUB.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT IS GOING TO BE A LITERARY
PHENOMENA OF NARRATIVE
DECONSTRUCTION AND SYMBOLIC
ANALYSIS, PLUS TOGETHER, WE WILL
DISCOVER HOW MANY COPIES OF THE
BOOK YOU'LL NEED TO LEVEL YOUR
KITCHEN TABLE.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND OUR VERY FIRST BOOK IS CAN CAN
REAT GATSBY" BY F. SCOTTIS "THEG
FITZGERALD.
FOLKS, WE'RE READYING IT FOR ALL
THE RIGHT REASONS-- BECAUSE
THERE'S A MOVIE OF IT COMING
OUT.
THIS WAY AT THE PREMIERE ON MAY
10, WE CAN SMUGLY TURN TO OUR
FRIENDS AND SAY, "THE BOOK WAS
BETTER."
THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY I'M PRETTY
SURE THE MOVIE IS GOING TO BE
AMAZING.
IT'S IN 3D.
THAT'S RIGHT!
IT FEELS LIKE THE THEMES OF
LONGING AND ALIENATION ARE IN
YOUR PIPES.
PLUS, A SOUNDTRACK BY JAY-Z,
JUST LIKE F. SCOTT FIT-ZEE WOULD
HAVE WANTED.
NOW, SURE, THE "THE GREAT
GATSBY" HERE IS ALREADY
CONSIDERED TO BE AN AMERICAN
CLASSIC, BUT NOTHING IS AN
AMERICAN CLASSIC UNTIL I SAY IT
IS.
WHICH IS WHY I'M CALLING ON YOU,
THOSE FEW LIT RAMEMBERS OF THE
COLBERT NATION, TO PICK THUP
BOOK AND-- THIS IS WHERE IT GETS
TRICKY-- READ THE WORDS INSIDE
OF IT, OKAY?
( LAUGHTER )
YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS TO FINISH IT,
NATION.
BECAUSE ON MAY 9, PULITZER
PRIZE-WINNING NOVELIST JENNIFER
EGAN WILLED LEAD THE BOOK CLUB'S
DISCUSSION AND THE DIRECTOR OF
THE MOVIE, BAZ LUHRMAN, WILL BE
HERE IN 3D.
( LAUGHTER )
TOGETHER, TOGETHER--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE WILL DECIDE WHAT IT'S GERALD
REALLY MEANT WHEN HE SAY, "SO WE
BEAT OBOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT,
BORNE BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE
PAST."
IT'S THE NAME OF HIS CHILDHOOD
SLED.
