YOU KNOW, FOLKS, SPEAKING OF
IDLE HANDS, THE UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE CONTINUES TO HOVER AROUND
AROUND.5%.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUT OF
WORK FOR SO LONG, THEY CAN
HARDLY REMEMBER WHY I FIRED
THEM.
( LAUGHTER )
COMPETITION FOR SCARCE JOBS IS
COMING FROM EVERYWHERE.
AND NOW IT'S COMING FROM WHERE
YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.
THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
DESTROYING AMERICA.
WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THE
THREAT OF OUTSIDERS STEALING
AWAY AMERICAN JOBS IS MORE
TERRIFYING THAN EVER.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUING
ABOUT WHETHER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
TAKE JOBS FROM AMERICANS.
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DO
THIS SOME INDUSTRIES.
>> TONIGHT WE EXAMINE ONE
ENDANGERED JOB, THE HARD-WORKING
AMERICAN LANDSCAPER.
>> THE ECONOMY TODAY IS VERY
TOUGH ON LANDSCAPING.
>> Stephen: MEET JEREMY, JOHN
AND ED OF NEW BEGINNING GARDEN
AND LAWN.
>> I'VE SEEN A LOT OF
LANDSCAPERS LOSE THEIR JOBS IN
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.
>> Stephen: THEY'VE LOST THOSE
JOBS BECAUSE OF EMPLOYERS LIKE
THIS.
>> MY NAME IS TAMMY DUNNIGAN.
I RUN A LANDSCAPING BUSINESS.
BUSINESS IS GREG BETTER AND
BETTER EVERY YEAR.
>> Stephen: THAT'S BECAUSE
TAMMI REFUSES TO EMPLOY AMERICAN
CITIZENS.
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE ROBERT
REICH THINKS MY OUTRAGE IS
UNNECESSARY.
>> WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT GETS VERY
HIGH, PEOPLE LOOK FOR
SCAPEGOATS.
THEY WANT TO BLAME OR PLACE
MAJOR BLAME ON IMMIGRANTS.
>> Stephen: EASY FOR HIM TO
SAY.
HIS LAND LANDSCAPING JOB ISN'T
BEING STOLEN BY TAMMY'S
UNDOCUMENTED EMPLOYEES.
>> MY GOATS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE SCAPEGOATS ARE GOATS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I'M SURE THAT THE SCAPEGOATS
ARE NOT ACTUAL GOATS.
>> Stephen: SORRY, BOBBY, THEY
ARE ACTUAL GOATS, AND THEY'RE
GOBBLING UP OUR JOBS.
>> GOATS ARE BIOLOGICALLY BUILT
TO EAT BRUSH AND TO DO THIS KIND
OF WORK.
>> Stephen: CLIENTS LIKE RUSS
AYERS HAVE GONE GOAT.
>> I DON'T THINK THAT HUMANS
EVER ANTICIPATED THAT GOATS
WOULD TAKE THEIR JOBS.
>> Stephen: BUT IT HAS
HAPPENED.
>> IT HAS HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: AND IT'S ALL PART
OF TAMMY'S MASTER PLAN.
>> I WILL MOTT BE SATISFIED
UNTIL GOATS ARE DOING ALL THE
LANDSCAPING JOBS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> THIS WOMAN IS COMPLETELY OUT
OF HER [BLEEPED] MIND, I'LL TELL
YOU RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: GINO IS ONE
LANDSCAPER WHO ISN'T GOING DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.
>> I TELL YOU THIS MUCH, IF I
FIND ANY GOATS ENCROACHING ON MY
OF MY JOBS, THERE WILL BE A LOT
OF GOAT STEW, WITHOUT A DOUBT.
COME ON, HOW CAN YOU COMPARE A
GOAT TO ME.
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
COMPARING GOATS TO GINO IS AN
ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY.
>> GOATS WORK 24 HOURS A DAY
UNTIL THE JOB IS COMPLETED.
>> THEY CAN GO WHERE PEOPLE AND
MACHINERY CAN'T GO SAFELY.
>> THE GOATS COST US ABOUT
$2,000 PER ACRE.
A HUMAN CREW WOULD COST US ABOUT
$10,000.
I THINK THEY'RE DOING GREAT WORK
AT A GREAT PRICE AND WITH THESE
GREAT SIDE BENEFITS.
>> Stephen: SUCH AS?
>> THERE WILL BE GOAT [BLEEPED]
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
GOAT LANDSCAPING'S NUMBER ONE
PROBLEM IS NUMBER TWO.
>> THEY COME.
THEY EAT.
THEY POOP.
AND THEY LEAVE.
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD EVER POOP
ON A JOB SITE.
♪♪
♪♪
♪ I DON'T THINK WE WOULD EVER
POOP ON A JOB SITE ♪♪
>> THAT IS A PROMISE.
>> Stephen: DESPITE THESE
CRITICISM, TAMMY'S BUSINESS HAS
CONTINUED TO GROW.
>> THE NUMBER OF GOATS IN MY
HERD HAS DEFINITELY GROWN.
I THINK I STARTED WITH A COUPLE
OF GOATS, AND I'M UP TO ABOUT
130 NOW.
>> I'M GETTING [BLEEPED] MAD
NOW.
130?
THAT MEANS THERE'S 130 PEOPLE
UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE OF THIS
WOMAN.
HOLY [BLEEPED].
>> Stephen: AND WHY THIS
EXPLOSIVE GROWTH?
>> EVERYBODY MOUNTS EVERYBODY.
THE GIRLS MOUNT THE GIRLS.
THE BOYS MOUNT THE BOYS.
>> Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE?
>> THE GIRLS MOUNT THE BOYS.
>> GOING A GOAT WOULDN'T BE HALF
BAD.
>> Stephen: AT THIS RATE THESE
HORNY GOATS ARE PUTTING THE
ENTIRE INDUSTRY AT RISK.
>> IF THE GOATS WERE TO TAKE
OVER OUR INDUSTRY, THE RIPPLE
EFFECTS, YOU HAVE CORPORATE
AMERICA WHO MAKES EQUIPMENT.
THERE'S FACTORIES.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
NON-EXISTENT.
FERTILIZER COMPANIES.
I'M SURE DOW CHEMICAL AND BHER
AREN'T GOING TO BE TOO HAPPY.
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME SERIOUS
[BLEEPED].
JOHN DEERE IS GOING TO BE JOHN
GOAT.
>> Stephen: AFTER THESE GOATS
HAVE STOLEN GINO'S JOB, NEXT
THEY COULD BE COMING AFTER
YOURS, AND IF THAT DOESN'T SCARE
THE GOAT [BLEEPED] OUT OF YOU,
LISTEN TO WHERE THESE GOATS ARE
HEADED NEXT.
>> SO THIS YEAR OUR GOATS WERE
HIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE TO WORK AT A NUCLEAR
SUBBASE.
>> DOES OBAMA KNOW ABOUT THIS
STUFF?
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.
YOU GOT NO CONTROL OF WHAT A
GOAT IS GOING TO DO.
>> Stephen: SO, AMERICA, BE
AFRAID.
>> AS THE FORMER SECRETARY OF
LABOR OF THE UNITED STATES, I
CAN ASSURE THE AMERICAN WORKER
THAT IN MY EXPERT OPINION THERE
IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO BE
AFRAID OF GOATS.
>> NO, WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID
OF GOATS AT ALL.
THEY'RE NO THREAT TO US
WHATSOEVER, WELL, NOT UNLESS THE
JOB THEY'RE STEALING IS CRAWLING
AROUND ON THE GROUND IN THE
BRAMBLES EATING BLACKBERRIES AND
POISON OUT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF THAT IS
THE JOB WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?
>> THEN THEY'RE A THREAT.
[BAAING]
>> Stephen: GOATS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GOATS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO STEAL
OUR LANDSCAPING JOBS, HUMANS ARE
GOING TO START PRODUCING||
