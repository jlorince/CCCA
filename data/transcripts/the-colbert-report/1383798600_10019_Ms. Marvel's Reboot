>> Stephen: WHOOO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: FEEL THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW, OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THEY ARE A LIVE WIRE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THIS ROOM IS SO ELECTRICKICALLY CHARGED RIGHT NOW, I WISH I WAS
WEARING RUBBER PANTS.
NOW FOLKS THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE AND I'M SORRY TO BRING YOU BAD NEWS.
BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AMERICA HAS LOST ANOTHER BATTLE IN THE CULTURE WAR.
WHICH IS SURPRISING BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ALL THE GUNS.
(LAUGHTER) THIS TIME THE BATTLEFIELD IS COMIC BOOKS.
AND FOLKS,S THAT SADDENS ME BECAUSE I'M A FAN.
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING I LOVE.
COLOURFUL PICTURES, AND A LACK OF GRAMMAR.
HULK MASH, STEPHEN LIKE.
AND TONIGHT, FOLKS, I GOT A REAL BEE IN MY CAPE OVER A DANGEROUS THEY EDITION TO
THE MARVEL UNIVERSE.
>> MARVEL COMICS IS REBOOTING A POPULAR SUPERHERO AND SHE IS AMONG THE FIRST TO BE BOTH FEMALE
AND MUSLIM.
THEY'RE BRINGING BACK MISS MARVEL, A 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER OF PAKISTANI IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN NEW JERSEY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT ON MISS MARVEL, MISS RODRA-GWEEZ.
FOLKS, THIS--  (LAUGHTER) THIS AFFRONT HAS TAKEN ME ABACK.
A MUSLIM CANNOT BE A SUPERHERO, FOR PETE'S SAKES, THEY'RE ON THE NO FLY LIST.
(LAUGHTER) HER NAME IS KAMALA KHAN AND AS MISS MARVEL, SHE CAN GROW AND SHRINK HER LIMBS AND HER
BODY, AND SHAPE SHIFT INTO OTHER FORMS.
FOLKS, IF SHE CAN SHAPE SHIFT, THAT MEANS LITERALLY ANYTHING COULD BE MUSLIM.
A LAMP, A SANDWICH, A TIGER, A NONTHREATENING MUSLIM.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S EVEN MORE UPSETTING WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ORIGINAL MISS MARVEL.
SHE WAS WHOLESOME AND ALL-AMERICAN.
BLOND, FAMILY VALUED WITH TWO BULGING CHEST MUSCLES.
AND CLEARLY WEARING HER SUNDAY CHURCH PANTIES.
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN SHARIA CREEP PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
FIRST SHE'S A COMIC CHARACTER.
THEN SHE GETS HER OWN MOVIE, THEN ACTION FIGURES, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, MY KIDS
ARE DRESSING UP AS HER FOR HALLOWEEN AND SHOUTING TRICK OR TREAT, DEATH TO CAPTAIN
