DID YOU THINK IT WOULD UPSET THENORTH KOREANS?
>> UH...
>> Stephen: DID YOU PICTURETHEM AS A JOLLY REGIME?
>> HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S GETTING AKICK OUT OF THAT LUBE EVERY TIME
I SEE THAT PICTURE.
>> Stephen: OH, HE LOVES IT
THAT'S HIS FRIEND LUBY.
>> EXACTLY.
WE DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD LOVETHE CONCEPT OF THE MOVIE, TO BE
TOTALLY HONEST, BUT MORE THANANYTHING
WE WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE THATHAD ONE FOOT IN REALITY
THAT'S SOMETHING WE ASFILMMAKERS LIKE AND THINK
IS INTERESTING ASAUDIENCE MEMBERS AS WELL.
>> Stephen: BUT IS ITAPPROPRIATE TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT
REAL THINGS IN THE WORLD?
>> I PERSONALLY THINK IT ISAPPROPRIATE TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT
REAL THINGS. WE THOUGHT MAYBE WECOULD INJECT SOME SLIGHT
RELEVANCE I GUESS, OR -- I'MWORRIED
>> Stephen: FOR A SECOND, I'M --DON'T WORRY
I DON'T HAVE POISON ON MY HANDS.
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT AN AGENT OF THE DPRK
DID YOU THINK ABOUT CHANGING HISNAME AT ALL, LIKE CALLING
HIM PHIL JONG-UN?
>> WE DID.
AND WE THOUGHT, WHOSE FEELINGSARE WE TRYING TO SPARE BY DOING
THAT, KIM JONG-UN?
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)>> AND SO...
>> Stephen: I'M BEHIND YOU100%.
I THINK THESE GUYS CAN SUCK IT.
>> YEAH, WE WERE FASCINATED BYWHAT WAS HAPPENING IN
NORTH KOREA. THE MORE WE READABOUT IT, THE MORE BIZARRE
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH RESEARCH
DID YOU DO ON THIS?
>> WE READ ABOUT IT A LOT.
WATCHED DOCUMENTARIES,RESEARCHED ONLINE,
READ NEWS ARTICLES. WHAT'SINTERESTING IS
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS BASEDON FACT BECAUSE VERY LITTLE REAL
INFORMATION GETS IN AND OUT OFNORTH KOREA.
BUT WE DID AS MUCH AS WE HUMANLYCOULD.
>> Stephen: DID YOU TALK TODENNIS RODMAN?
>> WE DIDN'T.
WE TALKED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WENTTO NORTH KOREA WITH DENNIS
RODMAN.
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
WE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO METKIM JONG-UN THEMSELVES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE IN THEMOVIE, ONE OF THE THINGS I
LIKE ABOUT IT IS HE'S A FUNGUY TO HANG OUT WITH.
>> ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGSTHEY SAID IS WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
ROOM WITH HIM, YOU'RE NOT ALWAYSAWARE OF WHERE HE IS.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THEROOM OFF WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES, YOU'RE ALWAYSAWARE WHERE HE IS. AND THEY SAID
YOU'RE HAVING A DRINK, HEAR ALAUGH, AND THEN KIM JONG-UN
WOULD JUST BE THERE -- WHAT AREYOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?
(LAUGHTER)WHICH IS SOMETHING WE PUT IN THE
MOVIE IS HE WAS KIND OFUNASSUMING.
WE TRIED TO MAKE HIM, FOR LACKOF A BETTER WORD, ADORABLE.
>> Stephen: HE IS.
HE'S ADORABLE UP TO A POINT.
>> UP TO A POINT, YES.
AND THEN WE TRY TO EXPOSE IN ACOMEDIC WAY AS POSSIBLE, WE TRY
TO GET INTO WHAT IS ACTUALLYHORRIBLE ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND
EXPLAIN WHAT IS BAD ABOUT IT.
AND IT IS REALLY BAD.
>> Stephen: A TOTALITARIANREGIME HIGHLIGHTED WITH
DICK JOKES.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK,WE HAVE A CLIP FROM THE MOVIE

IT'S LIKE A BIG ORANGE STRIPEYDOG.
(GROWLING)>> THERE'S A TIGER.
A TIGER!
