EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT SPEAKS
OUT AGAINST THE EVIL OF
MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL.
BUT I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS
FLAT LAND ENHANCING.
PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT FM
KENNEDY, JR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD THE SEE YOU AGAIN
MR. KENNEDY.
PLEASE, NO FORMALITY.
NOW, SIR, YOU'RE A LAWYER.
YOU'RE AN ENVIRONMENT ACTIVIST,
YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE WATER
KEEPER ALLIANCE AND YOU'RE ALSO
FEATURED IN A NEW DOCUMENTARY
FILM CALLED "THE LAST MOUNTAIN:
A FIGHT FOR OUR FUTURE" WHICH
OPENS IN SELECT CITIES FRIDAY.
LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE
CLIP.
>> COAL RIVER MOUNTAIN IS OUR
LAST GREAT MOUNTAIN IN THE
VALLEY THAT HASN'T BEEN BLASTED
TO ASHES.
[BLAST]
>> I KNOW THAT WE LIVE IN A VERY
INTELLIGENT COUNTRY THAT HAS THE
ABILITY TO CREATE ENERGY WITHOUT
BLOWING UP MOUNTAINS.
[EXPLOSION]
>> THESE COAL COMPANIES ARE
ABSOLUTELY RAPING AND STEALING
THE LAND, WEAR AND AIR THAT ALL
OF US THOUGHT WAS OURS.
>> PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH, AND
THEY'RE STANDING UP TO THE COAL
COMPANIES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
THAT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC.
WHAT I GOT FROM IT WAS: THINGS
BLOW UP REAL GOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
PRETTY AWESOME EXPLOSIONS IN
THIS MOVIE, RIGHT?
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF
EXPLOSIONS.
MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL IS A VERY
DESTRUCTIVE FORM OF STRIP
MINING.
AND OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS,
FOUR COAL COMPANIES HAVE LEVELED
AN AREA OF THE APPALACHIANS
LARGER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE.
IF YOU WENT OUT HERE TO THE
HUDSON AND FILLED 100 FEET, WE
WOULD PUT YOU IN JAIL, BUT IN
APPALACHIA, THEY'VE BLOWN UP
FIVE OF THE BIGGEST MOUNTAINS IN
WEST VIRGINIA AND THEY'VE FILLED
2,500 MILES OF RIVERS AND
STREAMS.
IT'S ALL ILLEGAL BUT THEY GET
AWAY WITH IT.
THEY BREAK THEIR BUSINESS
PLAN -- THE BUSINESS PLAN OF
THESE COMPANIES LIKE MASSEY
COAL, WHICH IS A CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE, IS TO BREAK THE LAW
AND SUBVERT DEMOCRACY TO GET
AWAY WITH IT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S EASY TO
SAY.
HASN'T THE FREE MARKET DETERMINE
COAL IS AMERICA'S FUTURE?
WE ARE THE SAUDI ARABIA OF COAL,
ARE WE NOT?
ARE WE NOT, SIR IN WE'VE GOT ALL
THE COAL THAT WE NEED FOR 250
YEARS, AND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO
MAINTAIN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.
EVEN IF IT MEANS BENDING THE
RULES OR FILLING IN A FEW
VALLEYS.
DON'T WE NEED THE LOOK AFTER
AMERICA'S FUTURE?
>> IF WE HAD A TRUE FREE MARKET
IN THING JOY SECTOR, COAL COULD
NOT SURVIVE FOR A MINUTE.
IT'S THE MOST CATASTROPHICALLY
EXPENSIVE WAY TO BOIL A POT OF
WATER THAT'S EVER BEEN DEVISED.
WE CAN MAKE ENERGY A LOT CHEAPER
WITH WIND, WITH SOLAR, WITH
GEOTHERMAL, WITH ALL KINDS OF
RENEWABLES.
>> LET ME GUESS, HEMP, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?
>> Stephen: REALLY?
WIND MILLS?
WIND MILLS ARE CUTE, OKAY.
I LIKE HOLLAND.
I LIKE WOODEN SHOES.
BUT YOU'RE TALKING KID MILLS.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW POT AND
PROSECUTION IS FREE.
IT SEEMING LIKE... HERE'S WHY IT
OFFENDS ME, SIR.
IT SEEMS LIKE A EUROPEAN ANSWER.
>> WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY... IF YOU
LOOK AT WHERE OUR ENERGY IS
COMING FROM, IT'S NOT A
PATRIOTIC THING TO BLOW UP AN
ENTIRE MOUNTAIN RANGE.
THE PURPLE MOUNTAINS MAJESTY OF
OUR COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE HARM IN
BLOWING UP THESE MOUNTAIN
RANGES.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT THEY'RE
A RENEWABLE RESOURCE.
TECTONIC MOVEMENT.
WILL GROW A NEW SET OF
MOUNTAINS.
WHAT'S THE HARM?
WHO IS BEING HURT REALLY?
>> AS THIS MOVIE SHOWS, THE
PEOPLE IN AN LATCHBACK ANYONE
WHO GETS IN THE WAY OF COAL,
DESPITE THE MANTRA OF THE
INDUSTRY, WE BRING JOBS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I
HEAR.
>> IN FACT, THEY BRING POVERTY
AND THEY DESTROY JOBS.
WHEN MY FATHER WAS FIGHTING
STRIP MINING IN APPALACHIA BACK
IN THE '60s, THERE WERE
151,000 UNIONIZED MINE WORK
CENTERS WEST VIRGINIA DIGGING
COAL OUT OF TUNNELS IN THE
GROUND.
TODAY BECAUSE OF A STRATEGY BY
THIS INDUSTRY, IF THEY'RE TAKING
TWICE AS MUCH COAL OUT OF WEST
VIRGINIA AS THEY WERE IN 1960,
BUT THERE ARE ONLY 15,000 MINERS
LEFT AND ONLY HALF ARE
UNIONIZED.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE FREE
MARKET.
>> THEY BLOW UP EVERY DAY IN
WEST VIRGINIA, THEY DEBT NIGHT
2,500 TONS OF AMMONIA NITRATE
EXPLOSIVES, THE EQUIVALENT OF A
HI ROCHEA BOMB ONCE A WEEK, AND
THEY'RE BLOWING THE TOPS OFF THE
MOUNTAINS TO GET AT THE COAL.
THEN THEY TAKE THE ROCK, DEBRIS
AND RUBBLES WITH THESE HUGE
MACHINES AND SCRAPE IT INTO THE
ADJACENT RIVER VALLEY.
THEY FLATTEN AN AREA LARGER THAN
THE STATE OF DELAWARE.
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY IN
OUR COUNTRY.
>> Stephen: IF THESE POOR
PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA ARE NOT
GETTING JOBS, IF THEIR LAND IS
BEING RAPED, WHY DON'T THESE
POOR PEOPLE JUST HIRE LOBBYISTS?
LAFTD LAUGHTER
TO FIGHT THE COAL COMPANY'S
LOBBYISTS?
AGAIN, THAT'S THE FREE MARKET.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S HOW
DEMOCRACY WORKS IN WEST
VIRGINIA.
IT'S REALLY NOT A DEMOCRACY
ANYMORE.
YOU HAVE A FEW LARGE COAL
COMPANIES WHO HAVE SUBVERTED
DEMOCRACY AT EVERY LEVEL.
THEY'VE CORRUPTED THE JUDGES.
THEY'VE CORRUPTED THE PUBLIC
OFFICIALS.
AND AS WE SHOWED, TWO-THIRDS OF
THE PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA
OPPOSE MOUNTAINTOP MINING, BUT
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE POLITICIAN
THAT OPPOSES IT BECAUSE THEY'VE
BEEN PURCHASED BY THE COAL
INDUSTRY.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING FOR
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND A
DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT PEOPLE, NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH
MONEY YOU HAVE.
>> BUT THE RECENT DECISION OF
CITIZENS UNITED SAYS THE
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, TOO,
AND THE AIM OF MONEY THEY HAVE
DETERMINES HOW MUCH SPEECH THEY
HAVE, AND SO CORPORATIONS JUST
HAPPEN TO BE BETTER AT TALKING
THAN PEOPLE ARE.
>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD POINT
ACTUALLY.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
SO FEW PEOPLE SAY THAT.
THANK YOU, MR. KENNEDY.
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR.
THE MOVIE IS "THE LAST MOUNTAIN"
OPENING IN SELECT CITIES THIS
FRIDAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
