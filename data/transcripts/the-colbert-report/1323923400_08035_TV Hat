EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, I LOVE TELEVISION, BUT
MOSTLY I LOVE COMMERCIALS.
I PERSONALLY SCREEN EVERY ONE OF
MY SPONSORS' ADS BEFORE WE AIR
THEM.
NOT ALL OF THEM CAN MAKE THE
CUT, ALTHOUGH SO FAR ALL OF THEM
HAVE.
AND WITH THE HOLIDAYS FAST
APPROACHING, MY ADVERTISERS HAVE
A TREASURE TROVE OF GREAT GIFT
IDEAS, NONE BETTER THAN THIS
ACTUAL COMMERCIAL THAT RAN
DURING MY SHOW.
>> IF YOU OWN AN iPOD,
IPHONE OR DIGITAL VIDEO PLAYER,
THEN YOU NEED TV HAT, PRIVATE,
PORTABLE AND HANDS-FREE.
TV HAT PROVIDES A MOTION PICTURE
EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.
>> Stephen: YES, TV HAT.
FOR THE FEW OF YOU WHO AREN'T
WATCHING THIS ON YOUR TV HAT
RIGHT NOW, I'LL EXPLAIN.
TV HAT IS TV IN HAT.
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.
NOW TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER, THIS
IS JUST AN ORDINARY BASEBALL
CAP, BUT SLIDE YOUR iPHONE
INTO THE UNDERRIM POCKET, PULL
DOWN THE DISCREET SIDE BLINDERS,
DROP THE PATENTED LENS AND YOU
ARE NOW IMMERSED IN A PRIVATE
MULTIMEDIA ENTERTAINMENT ZONE,
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD NONE
THE WISER.
HA, OH, THAT MALCOLM IS IN THE
MIDDLE AGAIN.
AND, FOLKS, AS THE AD POINTS
OUT, YOU CAN WEAR IT ANYWHERE,
TO THE AIRPORT, IN FRONT OF YOUR
COMPUTER, DURING YOUR DAILY
COMMUTE, EVEN AT THE BEACH.
GREAT IDEA BECAUSE NOTHING
RELAXES ME QUITE LIKE THE SOUND
OF CRASHING WAVES ON HAWAII 5-0.
PLUS IT'S INCREDIBLEBLY STYLISH.
>> ORDER YOUR OWN TV HAT OR
VISOR IN RED, WHITE, BLUE, KHAKI
OR CAMO.
>> Stephen: YES, CAMO, SO YOU
CAN WATCH TV WHILE YOU'RE
HUNTING.
AND UNLIKE MOST CHEAPO HAT
MAKERS, THE GOOD FOLKS AT TV HAT
DO NOT SKIMP ON THE BRIM.
THIS BABY KEEPS THE SUN OUT OF
YOUR EYES, OFF YOUR LEGS AND
GIVES YOU ENOUGH SHADOW TO
HARVEST MUSHROOMS.
BUT THE TREE GENIUS OF TV HAT IS
THAT IT LETS YOU FOCUS ON WHAT
MATTERS MOST BY BLOCKING OUT
UNNECESSARY DISTRACTIONS, LIKE
YOUR SPOUSE OR YOUR CHILDREN.
SO THEY REALLY SHOULD CONSIDER A
VERSION WITH AN iPAD FACING
OUT SO YOU CAN WATCH A YANKEES'
GAME WHILE YOU PLAY CATCH WITH
JUNIOR.
NOW, WITH TV HAT, YOU'LL NEVER
AGAIN HAVE TO SACRIFICE THE
IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE.
I REMEMBER THE NIGHT WHEN MY
DAUGHTER WAS BORN AND AS I HELD
THAT IMPOSSIBLE MIRACLE IN MY
HANDS AND COUNTED HER TEN
PERFECT FINGERS AND HER TEN
PERFECT TOES, I THOUGHT, I CAN'T
BELIEVE I'M MISSING "NIGHT
COURT."
SO, FOLKS, THIS CHRISTMAS,
REMEMBER TV HAT.
BUY ONE FOR YOURSELF AND BUY
ANOTHER FOR SOMEONE YOU LOVE TO
IGNORE.
