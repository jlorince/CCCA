NATION, I HEREBY WAIVE MY RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FIRST UP ON T-DUBS, EVERY DAY
DISTURBING RUMORS ARE COMING OUT
ABOUT THE GULF OIL SPILL.
FIRST I HEARD THE OIL IS
HAUNTED.
AND NOW THE LATEST RUMOR IS THAT
EVIDENTLY UNDER INTERNATIONAL
LAW, OFF-SHORE OIL RIGS LIKE
B.P.'S DEEP-WATER HORIZON ARE
ACTUALLY TREATED AS SHIPS.
NOW, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH
THAT.
EVERY SPRING I TAKE MY FAMILY ON
A SEVEN-DAY CRUISE AND DRILL,
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS,
LET'S SAY LEGALLY SHIP, WAS
SAILING UNDER A FOREIGN FLAG.
JIM.
>> IT OPERATED UNDER THE FLAG OF
THE NATION OF THE MARSHALL
ISLANDS.
IT IS REGISTERED THERE AND IS
SUBJECT TO THEIR LAWS.
>> THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A STERN
WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE MARSHALL
ISLANDS.
WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE?
AND MORE TO THE POINT, WHO ARE
THEY?
JIMMY, SHOW ME THE MARSHALL
ISLANDS ON GOOGLE EARTH.
OKAY.
ZOOM IN.
I THINK I SEE THEM.
THERE THEY ARE.
AND NO, THAT'S A BLASTIC BAG.
GO A LITTLE WEATHER AND THERE
THEY ARE.
THE MARSHAL ISLANDS, OUR NEW
ENEMY, NATION NOW, WHY ON EARTH
WOULD B.P. REGISTER AN OIL RIG
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WITH A
COUNTRY IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC?
>> THE COAST GUARD INSPECTION OF
A U.S. FLAG MOBILE OFF-SHORE
DRILLING UNIT TAKES TWO TO THREE
WEEKS, BUT THE SAFETY
EXAMINATION OF A FOREIGN FLAG
OFF-SHORE DRILLING UNIT, SUCH AS
THE DEEP-WATER HORIZON, TAKES
FOUR TO EIGHT HOURS.
>> Stephen: FOUR TO EIGHT
HOURS?
LOOK, I'M NO FAN OF REGULATION,
BUT I BELIEVE AN OIL RIG
INSPECTION SHOULD LAST LONGER
THAN A PHISH CONCERT.
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, WE MUST RETALIATE
AGAINST THIS AGGRESSION FROM THE
MARSHALL ISLANDS.
I SAY WE NUKE 'EM.
WHAT'S THAT?
WE DID?
[EXPLOSION]
TESTING OUR H-BOMB, WHAT, LIKE
ONCE, TWICE?
67 TIMES IN 12 YEARS?
WELL THEN CLEARLY THIS OIL SPILL
IS REVENGE.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
WE KNOW NUKES CAN'T STOP 'EM.
AND BY NOW I'M SURE THAT
RADIATION HAS MUTATED THEM INTO
HIDEOUS CRABS MEN.
THINK, COLBERT, THINK, HOW DO
YOU KILL SEA CREATURES?
I GOT IT, AN OIL SPILL.
B.P. HELP US OUT AND ALL IS
FORGIVEN.
NEXTLY, ALEX AND DONNA VOUTSINAS
OF BOYNTON BEACH, FLORIDA, HAS A
STORY THAT'S SURE TO TOUCH YOUR
HEART.
JIM.
>> ONE COUPLE HAS PROVEN THEY
WERE DESTINED TO EACH OTHER.
DAYS BEFORE THEIR WEDDING, ALEC
AND DONNA WERE LOOKING AT OLD
PHOTOS WHEN THEY FOUND ONE OF A
THEN-FIVE-YEAR-OLD DONNA AT
DISNEY WORLD.
A CLOSER LOOK REVEALS THAT ALEX
AND HIS DAD WERE ALSO IN THE
PICTURE.
THE COUPLE NOW THINKS THEY'VE
BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.
>> Stephen: INCREDIBLE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING ALEX AND
DONNA VOUTSINAS A WAG OF MY
FINGER FOR LETTING FATE MAKE YOU
HER BITCH.
[LAUGHTER]
NO, NO!
THIS IS AMERICA.
WE MAKE OUR OWN DESTINY HERE.
FATE IS JUST A WORD YOU USE WHEN
YOU'VE ABDICATED PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE
SUCCESSRY POSTERS THAT READ,
"GIVE UP, YOU HAVE NO CONTROL."
SO YOU APPEARED TOGETHER IN A
PHOTO AT DISNEY WORLD 20 YEARS
BEFORE YOU MET.
IT'S THE MOST POPULAR CHILDREN'S
DESTINATION ON THE GOD DAMN
PLANET.
LET ME GUESS, YOU BOTH LIKE
FOOD.
IT'S KISMET.
THAT IS WHY YOU MUST FIGHT THE
FATE AND GET A DIVORCE, THAT WAY
YOU WIN, UNLESS, UNLESS THIS
PHOTO IS EVIDENCE THAT YOU TWO
WERE DESTINED TO BE DIVORCED:
OH, MAN, THAT BLOWS MY MIND.
GOD, I WISH I NEVER DECIDED TO
DO THAT STORY, UNLESS I DIDN'T
DECIDE.
JIMMY, SHOW ME WHO IS IN THAT
COSTUME.
OH, MY GOD!
THAT MEANS ALEX VOUTSINAS SHOULD
HAVE MARRIED ME.
THERE'S STILL TIME TO FIX THIS.
ALEX, MEET ME ATOP THE EMPIRE
STATE BUILDING ON VALENTINE'S
