OF COURSE, THE THE MIDTERMSARE NEXT WEEK IN PENNSYLVANIA,
AND ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINEHOW EATING-FIDO-GATE WILL AFFECT
THE RACE BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIAGOVERNOR AND HIGH SCHOOL
PRINCIPAL WHO'S GOING TO LETTHIS GO "JUST ONCE,"
TOM CORBETT,  AND DEMOCRATCHALLENGER AND GUY WHO
WOULD "LOVE" TO SHOW YOU  HISDULCIMER PIANO, TOM WOLF.
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS RACECLOSELY, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN SEE
THE GAP IN THE POLLS FROM SPACEBECAUSE WOLF IS BEATING CORBETT
BY 17 POINTS.
CORBETT HAS ESPECIALLY FAILED TOATTRACT MINORITIES, WITH A
RECENT POLL PUTTING HISNON-WHITE SUPPORT AT 9%.
THE ONLY THING KEEPING CORBETTAFLOAT IS HIS ROCK-SOLID SUPPORT
AMONGST ALBINO HEDGEHOGS.
I DON'T GET IT.
THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THATBLACK PEOPLE LOVE TOM CORBETT.
LOOK AT THIS PHOTO ON HISWEBSITE.
SHOWING HIM INCHES FROM A BLACKWOMAN WHO COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
ABOUT IT.
BUT, OF COURSE, THE LIBERALMEDIA ARE TRYING TO RUIN HIS
BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF RACIALHARMONY.
>> GOVERNOR TOM CORBETT'SCAMPAIGN GOES ON THE DEFENSE
AFTER ACCUSATIONS IT PHOTOSHOPEDAN IMAGE ON CORBETT'S WEBSITE
TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE DIVERSE.
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMANSMILING THERE IN THE BACKGROUND
OF THE GROUP IS A STOCK IMAGEADDED BY THE CAMPAIGN.
THE WEB SITE BuzzFeed WASFIRST TO REPORT THIS.
>> Stephen: LEAVE IT TOBuzzFeed BUZZ KILLS TO BLOW
SOMETHING OUT OF PHOTOSHOPPEDPROPORTION.
CORBETT DID THIS WOMAN A FAVOR.BEFORE HE PASTED HER
INTO HIS VERY OWN RAINBOWCOALITION, SHE WAS OVER
ON SHUTTERSTOCK STUCK IN ABORING MEETING WITH A FINANCIAL
ADVISOR.
C'MON, NO RETIREMENT PLAN ISTHAT MUCH FUN.
FORTUNATELY, THE CORBETTCAMPAIGN ISN'T BACKING DOWN.
>> THE CORBETT CAMPAIGNRESPONDED BY SAYING THE ENTIRE
IMAGE IS PHOTOSHOPPED TO MAKE ITLOOK LIKE CORBETT WAS TALKING
WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE.
ALL WEBSITES USE GRAPHICS.
THE GRAPHIC REPRESENTS GOVERNORCORBETT'S WIDESPREAD SUPPORT
ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA.
>> Stephen: SEE?
THEY'RE NOT PRETENDING BLACKWOMEN LIKE HIM.
THEY'RE PRETENDING ANYONE LIKESHIM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE LOVE YOU TOM!
AND THEY'RE BEING MODEST HERE.
AS LONG AS THEY'RE PHOTOSHOPINGIN SUPPORTERS, THERE ARE ALL
KINDS OF IMPORTANT PENNSYLVANIACONSTITUENTS THEY LEFT OUT, LIKE
THE AMISH, PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL,THE PHILLY FANATIC, AND BEN
FRANKLIN HUMPING A CHEESE STEAK.
FOR THAT MATTER, I'M SURECORBETT WOULD BEAT TOM WOLF IF
HE LOST THE BLACK WOMAN ANDADDED TOM WOLF.
POINT IS, SOMETIMES TO APPEAL TOA DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHIC, REALITY
NEEDS A LITTLE BOOST.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MY AUDIENCE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
