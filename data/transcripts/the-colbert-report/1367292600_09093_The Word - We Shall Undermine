FORTUNATELY, WE CRISTIANS DON'T
HAVE TO SIT IDLY BY WHILE THE
GAYS SHOVE THEIR LOVE IN OUR
FACE.
AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WE SHALL UNDERMINE.
FOLKS, GAY MARRIAGE PROPONENTS
LOVE TO COMPARE THEIR STRUGGLE
TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
THANKFULLY, CONSERVATIVE
STALWART AND MAN WHO WISHES
KENNY G WOULD TURN DOWN THAT
ROCK MUSIC, PAT BUCHANAN
RECENTLY SHOT THAT COMPARISON
DOWN WRITING WHEN MARTIN LUTHER
KING CALLED ON THE NATION TO
LIVE UP TO THE MEANING OF ITS
CREED HE HEARD AN ECHO FROM A
THOUSAND PULPITS.
TREATING BLACK FOLKS DECENTLY
WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
CRISTIANS HAD BEEN TAUGHT.
DR. KING WAS PUSHING AGAINST AN
OPEN DOOR.
EXACTLY.
M.L.K. HAD IT EASY.
THAT MOUNTAIN TOP HE WENT TO?
PROBABLY HAD A CHAIR LIFT.
THE MAN LOVED HITTING THE
SLOPES.
BUT THESE GAY ACTIVISTS WILL NOT
GET THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT
KING GOT FROM CONSERVATIVE
CRISTIANS.
AS PAT WRITES IF THE GAY RIGHTS
AGENDA IS IMPOSED WE COULD HAVE
PRIESTS AND PASTORS PREACHING
NOT ACCEPTANCE BUT PRINCIPLED
REJECTION, A PUBLIC REJECTION OF
THE NEW LAWS BY MILLIONS AND A
REFUSAL BY MANY TO RESPECT OR
OBEY THEM.
A NEW ERA OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
MAY BE AT HAND.
AMEN, BROTHER.
A NEW ERA OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.
THEY MAY LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE
BUT I REFUSE TO FALL IN LOVE AND
MARRY ANOTHER MAN IN A FABULOUS
DESTINATION WEDDING IN CORSICA
ON THE BEACH, EVERYONE WEARING
CREAM COLORD LINEN NO SHOES AT
SUNSET WITH A STEEL DRUM BAND.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I WON'T DO IT.
I WILL NOT DO IT.
OUR STRUGGLE WILL NOT BE EASY,
MY STRAIGHT BROTHERS AND
SISTERS.
BUT TAKE COMFORT IN THE WORDS OF
MAHATMA GANDHI -- THE GANDHI OF
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE -- WHO SAID,
"FIRST THEY IGNORE YOU.
THEN THEY RIDICULE YOU.
THEN THEY FIGHT YOU.
AND THEN YOU WIN."
ALSO, TWO DUDES GETTING HITCHED?
YEESH, I HAVE LOST MY APPETITE."
BUT NATION, RELIGIOUS LEADERS
IMPOSING THEIR BELIEFS ON PUBLIC
POLICY IS NOT ENOUGH.
NO, WE NEED TO TAKE PERSONAL
ACTION JUST AS THE LITTLE ROCK
NINE MARCHED INTO THAT SCHOOL,
SO TOO MUST WE MARCH INTO BRIAN
AND ROGER'S WEDDING AND CHAIN
OURSELVES TO THE CHAMPAGNE
FOUNTAIN.
AND WHEN YOU R.S.V.P., WHICH OF
COURSE YOU'LL DO BECAUSE IT WILL
BE A FUN WEDDING, CHECK THE BOX
FOR CHICKEN BUT WHEN YOU ARRIVE
ASK FOR THE SALMON.
IT WILL THROW CATERING INTO
CHAOS.
THEN WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT,
SIDLE UP TO THE D.J. AND REQUEST
A ONE-HOUR BLOCK OF PHISH.
THE POINT IS, IF CONSERVATIVES
ARE GOING TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT
GAY MARRIAGE, WE NEED TO PROTEST
AS IF WE WERE A MARGINALIZED AND
CONDEMNED MINORITY.
BECAUSE IF WE KEEP PRETENDING WE
CAN DENY GAY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO
MARRY, WE WILL BE.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
