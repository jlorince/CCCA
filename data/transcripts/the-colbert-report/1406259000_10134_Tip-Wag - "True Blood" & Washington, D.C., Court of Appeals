NATION-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, I'VE GOT SOMETHINGON MY MIND AND NOW I'M GOING
SMEAR IT ALL OVER YOURS.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAGOF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FIRST UP ON T TO THE DUBS, I'M
HOOKED ON THE HBO SHOW "TRUEBLOOD" AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO
FOX NEWS ANCHOR SHEPARD SMITHWHO DROPPED A FEW SUBTLE HINTS
ABOUT HOW MUCH HE ENJOYS IT.
>> DO YOU WATCH THAT SHOWTRUE BLOOD?
>> SUNDAY IS EPISODE 2 OFTRUE BLOOD.
>> TRUE BLOOD IS BACK.
I'M TELLING YOU, DON'T DRINKTHE V COME ON, DON'T DRINK
THE V.
>> DON'T DRINK THE V, THANKYOU, MIKE, DON'T DRINK THE
V.
>> DO YOU NOT WATCH TRUE BLOOD,BECAUSE YOU CAN GET ALL
AMPED UP ON V AND DO ALL KINDSOF WEIRD THINGS.
>> Stephen: YEAH. ALL KINDS OFWEIRD THINGS LIKE THAT ONE
TIME SHEP GAVE OUT HISHBO GO PASSWORD AND THEN
DEMANDED PEOPLE WATCH TRUEBLOOD WHILE HOLDING A KNIFE
TO BRIT HUME'S THROAT.
WHICH IS WHY I AM SO SAD TOGIVE A WAG OF MY FINGER TO
"TRUE BLOOD" FOR MAKING MYBLOOD TRULY BOIL WITH LAST
WEEK'S EPISODE IN WHICH THEVAMPIRE SNUCK INTO A BENEFIT
FOR TED CRUZ IN ATRANSPARENT HOLLYWOOD ATTACK
ON REPUBLICANS.
>> THE SECOND I TOLD HER THAT'SWHERE MOMMY AND DADDY
WERE GOING, SHE HUNG UP.
>> LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TOA GALA.
>> SECURITY'S GOING TO BETIGHT.
>> AND THEY ONLY INVITEDASSHOLES
WE CAN BE ASSHOLES
OF ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS IHAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 100 YEARS
THIS COULD BE THE MOSTDISTURBING
>> OH MY GOD-- I'M AREPUBLI-[BLEEP].
>> Stephen: DID YOU HEARTHAT?
DID YOU HEAR THAT, A REPUBL-CWORD I CAN'T SAY.
WELL PLAYED HOLLYWOOD, THATIS THE MOST DEVASTATING
CRITIQUE OF A POLITICALIDEOLOGY SINCE KARL MARX
PUBLISHED "DAS KAPI-TAINT" ANDI'M NOT THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE
UPSET BY TRUE BLOOD'S BLEEDINGHEART INTO MOUTH AGENDA.
>> SUNDAY NIGHT'S EPISODE OFTRUE BLOOD SERIES WAS A
CONSERVATIVE BASHFEST.
BUT THE VULGARITY OF ATTACKSHAS MANY ASKING DID THE SHOW
GO TOO FAR?
>> FOLKS NEED TO UNDERSTANDTHAT TV IS ALL ABOUT
ATTITUDE IMPLANTATION, IT'SALL ABOUT CREATING FEELINGS
INSIDE OF YOU.
HERE IS THE THING, MOSTPEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
WHO TED CRUZ IS.
THEY TEND TO VOTE BASED ONTHE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAVE,
LARGELY IMPLANTED BY THEENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
>> Stephen: WELL SAID.
TV ENTERTAINMENT DRIVES OURPOLITICAL DISCOURSE.
REMEMBER NO ONE WAS TALKINGABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY
UNTIL THE DEBUT OF "TWOBROKE GIRLS"
BUT WE-- WE SHOULD NOT BESURPRISED AT ALL THAT
VAMPIRES ARE DEMOCRATS.
AFTER ALL, THEY SCREAM WHENTHEY SEE A CROSS.
(LAUGHTER)NEXT UP-- NEXT UP, FOLKS,
GIVE ME A SECOND HERE, IWANT TO MAKE SURE I GOT MY
PLASTIC TARP DOWN BECAUSETHE NEXT STORY MAKES ME SO
HAPPY I MIGHT START LEAKINGNEWS JUICE, JIM.
>> OBAMACARE SUFFERS PERHAPSITS BIGGEST SETBACK YET.
>> A FEDERAL APPEALS COURTRULING THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT AS WRITTEN ONLY ALLOWSINSURANCE SUBSIDIES IN
STATES THAT SET UP THEIR OWNEXCHANGES.
>> COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS OFAMERICANS ENROLLED UNDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTHCARE LAW MAY BE IN JEOPARDY.
>> BIG BLOW FOR OBAMACAREAND WE'RE ACCURATE IN
SAYING IT IS A HUGE BLOW FOROBAMACARE.
>> THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW ANEWS ORGANIZATION IS
TRUSTWORTHY.
THEY MAKE THE EXTRA EFFORTTO POINT OUT WHEN THEY'RE
BEING ACCURATE.
(LAUGHTER)AND FOLKS, THEY ARE, THIS
TIME.
OBAMACARE-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: MAKE NO MISTAKE,THEY ARE ACCURATE IN SAYING
THAT OBAMACARE IS DEAD.
NOW THE LAST TIME I DECLAREDOBAMACARE DEAD I DROPPED
BALLOONS AND THEN TWERKEDWITH THE GRIM REAPER.
SO FOLKS, THAT'S ALL BEENDONE.
BUT LIKE VOTING TO REPEALOBAMACARE, WE ARE GOING TO
DO IT AGAIN.
COME ON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WHOOO!
♪♪ KUZ I'M HAPPY
♪(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HE'S A GOOD GUY.
DEATH IS A GOOD GUY AND AHELL OF A DANCER.
AND THIS HAPPY NEWS BRINGSME TO THE TIP OF THE HAT TO
THE WASHINGTON D.C. COURT OFAPPEALS
YOU SEE, IN A 2-1 VOTE THECOURT THIS WEEK RULED THAT
RESIDENTS OF THE 36 STATESTHAT HAVE NOT SET UP THEIR
OWN OBAMACARE INSURANCEEXCHANGES CANNOT GET FEDERAL
HEALTH CARE SUBSIDIESBECAUSE THE EXACT WORDS OF
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAYTHAT SUBSIDIES ARE AVAILABLE
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE, QUOTE,ENROLLED IN THROUGH AN
EXCHANGE ESTABLISHED BY THESTATE.
AND BECAUSE IT'S WRITTENEXACTLY THAT WAY THE COURT
RULED THAT SUBSIDIES AREONLY AVAILABLE ON
STATE-BASED EXCHANGES, NOTON THE HEALTH CARE.GOV
EXCHANGE AND THEY BASE IT ONTHE WELL ESTABLISHED
PRECEDENT, YOU FORGOT TO SAYSIMON SAYS.
(APPLAUSE)NATION, 5.6-- 5.6 MILLION
PEOPLE COULD NOW LOSE THEIRINSURANCE BECAUSE OF THIS
PHRASEOLOGY.
I BELIEVE THIS IS A TRIUMPHOF TYPO OVER INTENT.
THE DEMOCRATS WHO WROTE THISLAW SHOULD HAVE PROOFREAD IT
OR AT LEAST NOT HAVE SENT ITFROM THEIR iPHONE.
THIS RULING IS JUST THELATEST IN OUR NATION'S LONG
HISTORY OF LEGALLY BINDINGTYPOS.
WHO REQUEST FORGET THE BRIEF,DANGEROUS PERIOD WHEN
AMERICANS ONLY HAD THE RIGHTTO KEEP AND BEAR RAMS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT-- FOLKS AS CONSTITUTIONAL
ORIGINALISTS, ALLCONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT
WHEN YOU MAKE A TYPO, YOUHAVE TO STICK WITH IT I MEAN
WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE NAMETHEIR CHILD REINCE PRIEBUS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
