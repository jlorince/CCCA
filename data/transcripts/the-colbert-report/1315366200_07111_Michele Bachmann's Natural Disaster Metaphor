(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S REALLY NICE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU EVERYBODY DOWN HERE.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
YOU'RE TOO KIND.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I... I
HAVE BEEN ON BREAK FOR TWO WEEKS
AND WHILE I WAS GONE, THE EAST
COAST WAS STRUCK BY AN
EARTHQUAKE AND A HURRICANE.
(LAUGHTER)
ONE MORE NATURAL DISASTER AND WE
GET A FREE BLIZZARD.Z
IN LIGHT OF THESE EVENTS, I AM
FORCED TO ISSUE A RARE PUBLIC
APOLOGY TO THE GAYS.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, IF YOU'RE WATCHING AND
YOU'RE GAY, WAKE UP YOUR
PARTNER.
(LAUGHTER)
I WANT RAFAEL TO HEAR THIS, TOO.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SEE, I WASN'T STATESIDE WHEN
THIS WENT DOWN, I WAS IN NEW
ZEALAND.
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE TO GET MAORI
WARRIOR FUR-COVERED CROTCH FLAPS
AT A REASONABLE PRICE.
MY OLD ONES ARE ALL WORN OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
I KNOW FROM MY T.V. PREACHER
FRIENDS THAT GOD SENDS
HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES TO
PUNISH GAYNESS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHEN I HEARD THAT HE HAD HIT
THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES WITH A
HURRICANE AND AN EARTHQUAKE I
NATURALLY THOUGHT "HOW GAY DID
THE GAYS GAY IT THIS TIME?"
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, IS WASHINGTON, D.C. NOW
A.C./D.C.?
DID LINCOLN GIVE JEFFERSON A
REACH-AROUND?
(LAUGHTER)
DID LADY LIBERTY JOIN A SOFTBALL
LEAGUE?
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, TURNS OUT IT WASN'T CAUSED
BY THE GAYS AND I SINCERELY
APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCENTIVE THE
THINGS I JUST SAID ABOUT THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
MICHELE BACHMANN EXPLAINED THE
REAL REASON.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOD HAS
TO DO TO GET THE ATTENTION OF
THE POLL POLITICIANS.
WE'VE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE, A
HURRICANE.
HE'S SAID "ARE YOU GOING TO
START LISTENING TO ME, HERE?"
LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
>> Stephen: YES, HURRICANE
HAVE THAT HOLE IN THE MIDDLE
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOD'S MEGAPHONE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT HE USES SO POLITICIAN CANS
HEAR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OVER
HIS EARLIER EARTHQUAKE WHICH I
BELIEVE IS GOD'S SUBWOOFER.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, OF COURSE, OF COURSE THE
BLAME-SCREAM-SCREEDA ON... THANK
YOU.
TRADEMARK.
ON THEIR SUNDAY GOTCHA SHOWS
HAVE TO QUESTION EVERYTHING.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD DOES
USE THE WEATHER TO SEND PEOPLE
MESSAGES HERE ON EARTH?
>> OBVIOUSLY I WAS SPEAKING
METAPHORICALLY.
THAT WAS CLEAR TO THE AUDIENCE.
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME.
>> Stephen: OKAY?
METAPHOR.
IN THIS METAPHOR, GOD REPRESENTS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
POLITICIANS REPRESENT
THEMSELVES.
AND THE HURRICANE REPRESENTS THE
EARTHQUAKE.
OKAY?
(LAUGHTER)
METAPHOR.
AND BACHMANN HERSELF IS A
SIMILARLY BECAUSE SHE IS LIKE OR
AS SOMEONE WHO MAKES SENSE.
