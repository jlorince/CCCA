SILENCE.
NATION, I'VE DONE SOMETHING
I THOUGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
I HAVE HEART KARL ROVE.
LEGEND'S SAY YOU NEED AN
ELVIS BLADE TO DO THAT.
WHICH-- WHICH I HAPPEN TO
HAVE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET ME EXPLAIN.
KARL IS UP SET ABOUT LAST
THURSDAY'S COLBERT REPORT IN
WHICH I DISCUSS HIS TWO
POLITICAL ACTION GROUPS.
AMERICAN CROSSROADS, WHICH
CAN RECEIVE UNLIMITED MONEY
BUT HAS TO DISCLOSE THE
NAMES OF ITS DONORS.
AND CROSS DID ROADS GPS
WHICH IS CALLED A 501 C-4
AND WHICH CAN ALSO COLLECT
UNLIMITED MONEY AND DOESN'T
HAVE TO DISCLOSE ANY ITS
DONOR.
SO I DECIDED TO COPY KARL
AND FORM MY OWN 501 C-4,
COLBERT SUPERPAC SHH.
I THOUGHT-- I THOUGHT--
(APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE
FLATTERED.
IT'S NOT LIKE I COPY
EVERYTHING KARL DOES.
OTHER THAN THAT ONE TIME
WHEN WE WERE ROOMMATES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AFTER I FORMED MY SECRET
DONOR C-4 I ASKED MY LAWYER
AND DEAR FRIEND BY THE HOUR
TREVOR POTTER, HOW THE MONEY
COULD BE USED.
I CAN TAKE THIS C-4 MONEY
AND THEN DONATE IT TO MY
SUPERPAC?
>> YOU CAN.
>> Stephen: SO I CAN TAKE
SECRET DONATIONS OF MY C--- :C-4
AND GIVE IT TO MY SUPPOSEDLY
TRANSPARENT SUPERPAC.
>> AND IT WILL SAY GIVEN BY
YOUR C-4.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND
MONEY LAUNDERING?
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOT TRUE.
IT'S ONLY HARD TO SAY UNDER
OATH.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THE BLAME STEVE MEDIA
TWISTED MY WORDS WITH
MISLEADING ARTICLES LIKE
COLBERT SLAINS ROGUE'S MONEY
LAUNDERING SCHEME.
AND STEPHEN COLBERT VERSUS
KARL ROVE, WHO'S BETTER AT
MONEY LAUNDERING?
HEY, HEY MEDIA, I WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT KARL ROVE'S
SHADOWY UNACCOUNTABLE
ORGANIZATIONS.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY
IDENTICAL SHADOWY
UNACCOUNTABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT MY
SHOW WAS DELIBERATELY
MISREPRESENTED IN THE NEWS.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE
OTHER WAY AROUND, GUYS.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
TRUE, I HAVE NOW RECEIVED AN
E-MAIL FROM KARL ROVE'S
LAWYER.
OKAY.
HE CONTACTED MY LAWYER
SAYING, AND I QUOTE, COPYING
FUTURE DISTRIBUTION OR USE
OF THIS COMMUNICATION IS
PROHIBITED.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
ABOUT READING IT ON
TELEVISION.
SO [BLEEP] IT, HERE WE GO.
WHOEVER, IN ORDER THAT YOU
HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION
CROSSROADS GPS HAS NOT MADE
ANY TRANSFERS TO AMERICAN
CROSSROADS.
AND CROSSROADS GPS DOES NOT
INTEND TO MAKE ANY TRANSFERS
TO AMERICAN CROSSROADS.
GOING FORWARD, ANY INNUENDO
THAT SUCH TRANSFERS HAVE
BEEN MADE CAN READILY BE
DISMISSED BY SIMPLY
REVIEWING THE AMERICAN
CROSSROADS FEC FILING.
FAIR ENOUGH.
SO TO UNDO THE DAMAGE I HAVE
UNWITTINGLY DONE TO KARL'S
OTHERWISE SPOTLESS
REPUTATION--
(LAUGHTER)
I WILL NOW ISSUE A RARE
CLARIFICATION.
AS HIS LAWYER POINTS OUT,
KARL ROVE HAS TWO POTS OF
MONEY.
ONE THAT CAN TAKE UNLIMITED
DONATIONS FROM ANYBODY, BUT
HE'S GOT TO REPORT WHO THEY
ARE.
AND ANOTHER, WAY BIGGER POT
OF MONEY, THAT CAN TAKE
UNLIMITED DONATIONS AND THEY
DON'T HAVE TO REPORT JACK
SQUAT.
NOT TO IMPLY THAT KARL'S
RECEIVING DONATIONS FROM
TEXAS OIL TYCOON JACK QUOTE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO, OF COURSE, INHERITED
THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE FROM
HIS FATHER, PAPA SQUAT.
THERE IS NO-- REPEAT-- REPEAT,
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF
MONEY LAUNDERING.
AND KARL'S LAWYER
SPECIFICALLY ASSURES US THAT
NO MONEY FROM CROSSROADS GPS
WILL BE LAUNDERED.
THAT IS A PROMISE FROM KARL
ROVE.
BUT IF THERE IS ANY DIRTY
MONEY, IT WILL STAY DIRTY.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU GOT TO RESPECT THAT.
NOW IN THAT SAME SHOW I ALSO
SAID KARL ROVE'S HEAD LOOKS
LIKE A HAM LOAF WITH GLASSES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF YOU EAT THAT HAM, YOU
GAIN ROGUE'S MEMORIES.
I WOULD APOLOGISE FOR THAT
TOO, BUT SINCE THEY DON'T
MENTION IT IN THE E-MAIL I
ASSUME THEY AGREE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLKS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I BELIEVE A
CLARIFICATION IS NOT ENOUGH.
I WANT TO APOLOGISE TO KARL
FACE-TO-FACE.
UNFORTUNATELY, HE DID NOT
RESPOND WHEN I DID NOT REACH
OUT TO HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'RE BOTH VERY BUSY MEN.
SO INSTEAD I'M GOING TO
APOLOGISE FACE TO HAM LOAF
WITH GLASSES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY.
HAM ROVE, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING ME AGAIN.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I NEVER
MEANT TO IMPLY YOU WERE A
MONEY LAUNDERER, OKAY.
PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.
(LAUGHTER)
HMMMM, SILENT TREATMENT.
I GUESS I'VE GOT THAT
COMING.
WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO KNOW IF HE ACTUALLY
FORGIVES ME.
(LAUGHTER)
AAAAAHHHH!
HE'S COOL WITH IT!
WELL, THANK GOODNESS.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SO GLAD THINGS ARE
KOSHER BETWEEN ME AND KARL.
SADLY, THINGS CAN NEVER BE
KOSHER WITH HAM ROVE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
