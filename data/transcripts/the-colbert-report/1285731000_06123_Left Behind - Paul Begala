EVERYBODY.
NATION, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ON
ROPES.
PEOPLE HAVE COUNTED HIM OUT, BUT
THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN, THIS GUY IS
ABINCREDIBLE CAMPAIGNER, AND
YESTERDAY HE ANNOUNCED A BOLD
INITIATIVE THAT IS SURE TO WIN
BACK THE GOODWILL OF YOUNG
VOTERS.
>> I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE LONGER
SCHOOL YEARS.
WOOO!
MORE SCHOOL.
LISTEN, BARRY, YOU MAY BE
COMMAND-NERD IN CHIEF, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THE REST OF US HAVE
TO SUFFER.
SUMMER'S BEST.
NEXT YEAR WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO
UP TO COOPER LAKE WITH BILLY AND
BRANDON AND THE GUYS.
MR. GAUTHIER BOUGHT JET SKIS AND
WE'RE GOING TO RACE.
I HATE YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS HAS GOT TO BE OBAMA'S WORST
LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE SINCE THE
"YOU FORGOT TO GIVE US HOMEWORK"
ACT OF 2009.
WELL, THANKFULLY OBAMA'S DAYS
ARE NUMBERED BECAUSE LAST WEEK
THE REPUBLICANS LAUNCHED THEIR
HISTORIC "PLEDGE TO AMERICA,"
WHICH HAS SOMETHING TO PLEASE
EVERYONE.
JIMMY.
POP ME A BOEHNER.
>> IF REPUBLICANS WIN THE
MAJORITY IN NOVEMBER, IT WILL
NOT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL.
IT WILL NOT BE BUSINESS AS
USUAL.
IT WILL NOT BE BUSINESS AS
USUAL.
>> YES, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE
DIFFERENT.
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ANY
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN.
>> Stephen: EXCEPT ANYTHING.
SO YOU CAN SEE...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ABSOLUTELY.
GIVE IT UP FOR JOHN BOEHNER.
NOTE TO SELF, BUY PUMPKIN.
OKAY.
SO YOU CAN SEE, YOU CAN SEE WHY
THE REPUBLICAN BASE IS SO
PUMPED.
IN FACT, ON THE GENERIC BALLOT
OF REPUBLICAN VERSUS DEMOCRAT,
POLLS SHOW THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE
A FOUR-POINT ADVANTAGE.
THEY ALSO HAVE A TEN-POINT
ADVANTAGE ON THE SUPER GENERIC
BALLOT WHICH REMOVES PARTY
ALTOGETHER AND ASKS PEOPLE JUST
TO GRUNTS AT EITHER RED OR BLUE.
[GRUNTING]
MEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS AREN'T
FEELING QUITE AS PERKY.
JIM?
>> THE ENTHUSIASM GAP WE'RE
SEEING IN THIS ELECTION THAT
LIKELY VOTERS ARE NOW MORE
LIKELY TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENTHUSIASM
GAP, IT'S A 20-POINT ADVANTAGE
FOR THE REPUBLICANS.
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT TO BE
WORRIED THAT THEY'VE GOT APATHY
ON THEIR SIDE.
>> DEMOCRATS ARE A LITTLE
DISAFFECTED.
>> Stephen: YES, DEMOCRATS ARE
FEELING DISAFFECTED, WHICH IS
DIFFERENT THAN MOST ELECTIONS
WHEN THEY ARE STOKED WITH
CAUTIOUS SCEPTICISM.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, DEMOCRATIC
SELF-LOATHING HAS GOTTEN SO BAD
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR SYMBOL
FROM A SILHOUETTE OF A DONKEY TO
EEYORE EATING A WHOLE CHOCOLATE
CHEESECAKE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
EVEN LONGTIME PROM -- PROMINENT
OBAMA SUPPORTERS ARE MUMBLING
THEIR APATHY, LIKE SHEPPARD
FERRY, WHO DESIGNED THE FAMOUS
OBAMA HOPE POSTER, THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL POLITICAL POSTER
SINCE THE ONE THAT GOT FARRAH
FAWCETT'S NIPPLES ELECTED
GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA.
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER WHICH ONE
IS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.
NOW, IF OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN WERE
GOING ON TODAY, FERRY SAYS HE
COULDN'T DESIGN THE SAME HOPE
POSTER BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE
OBAMA CAMPAIGN HASN'T CARRIED
OVER TO THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY.
TODAY THE POSTER WOULD LOOK LIKE
THIS:
[LAUGHTER]
THE DEMOCRATS' REAL MISTAKE I
THINK WAS MOTIVATING VOTERS WITH
HOPE INSTEAD OF FEAR.
YOU SEE, HOPE CAN BE STRANGLED
IN ITS CRADLE, BUT FEAR IS
HARDER TO KILL.
BECAUSE EVEN IF IT IS KILLED,
WHO KILLED IT?
THERE'S A MURDERER ON THE LOOSE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, DEMOCRATS...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU, YOU ARE FACING A TOUGH
CHOICE.
YOU COULD STAND UP AND FIGHT.
BUT THAT SOUNDS HARD.
[LAUGHTER]
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER JUST TO
LAY DOWN AND LET A WAVE OF
CONSERVATIVE ENTHUSIASM BURY YOU
ALIVE?
AFTER ALL, IT'S COMFORTABLE DOWN
THERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND IF YOU GET UP AND VOTE, YOU
COULD JUST BE DISAPPOINTED
AGAIN.
SO DON'T YOU THINK GETTING
WORKED UP IS JUST NOT WORTH IT?
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THE CONTROL OF
CONGRESS.
I MEAN, SOMETIMES BEING OUT OF
POWER IS REALLY A BREATH OF
FRESH AIR.
JOINING ME NOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT
MY ADVICE MIGHT MEAN FOR THE
DEMOCRATS, PLEASE WELCOME
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST PAUL
BEGALA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PAUL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
I JUST WANT TO PAT THAT DOWN.
OKAY.
NOW, PAUL, OKAY, WHY DO YOU
THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE SO
APATHETIC RIGHT NOW?
WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIRE THEM UP
SO THEY'RE MERELY INDIFFERENT?
>> THEY'VE GOT TO BE FIRED UP.
THEY NEED TO RISE UP OUT OF THAT
GRAVE, GRAB THE SHOVEL, SMACK
JOHN BOEHNER UPSIDE HIS ORANGE
HEAD.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: PAUL, THAT IS A
THREAT OF VIOLENCE, AND I
BELIEVE I CAN HAVE YOU ARRESTED
NOW.
>> NO DOUBT.
>> Stephen: SO WHY ARE THE
DEMOCRATS JUST TAKING THIS LYING
DOWN?
>> WELL, "THE ART OF WAR" SAID
TO KILL THE ENEMY, WE MUST ROUSE
OUR TROOPS TO ANGER, AND RIGHT
NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT BEING
ROUSED TO ANGER.
THEY'RE BEING RUSED TO APATHY OR
THEY'RE BEING TOLD THEY ARE NOT
WORKING HARD ENOUGH.
>> Stephen: CAN WE BLAME
OBAMA?
>> I THINK THEY'VE BEEN TOO HARD
ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE.
I HAVE THIS ODD IDEA THAT YOU
OUGHT TO ATTACK THE ENEMY
INSTEAD OF YOUR FRIEND.
>> Stephen: COULD OBAMA JUST
TURN AGAINST HIMSELF?
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE DOING
THAT.
EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE WINNING AWAY
FROM BARACK OBAMA AND THE THINGS
THAT BARACK OBAMA ACHIEVED.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING,
OBAMA'S DONE TOO MUCH.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING, OBAMA
HASN'T DONE ENOUGH.
>> RIGHT.
AND I THINK THE DEBATE NEEDS TO
STOP FOR THE DEMOCRATS BEING
ONLY ABOUT OBAMA AND HIS GREAT
IDEAS, WHICH I SUPPORT, DRAW A
CONTRAST WITH THEIR IDEAS.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE THOSE
GOOD IDEAS?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA?
HE SAVED THE ECONOMY, EXTENDED
HEALTH CARE.
>> Stephen: EVERYBODY WANTS TO
SAVE THE ECONOMY.
THAT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA.
I LOVE CASH IS NOT A BUSINESS
PLAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> I THINK HE'S DOING GREAT.
BUT I THINK DEMOCRATS NEED A
HENNE YOUNGMAN STRATEGY.
>> Stephen: TAKE MY WIFE
PLEASE?
>> NO, THE OTHER ONE.
EVERY TIME SOMEONE ASKED HENNE
YOUNGMAN, "HOW'S YOUR WIFE," HE
SAID, "COMPARED THE WHAT."
HOW ARE THE DEMOCRATS?
COMPARED THE WHAT.
THE REPUBLICANS PROTECT
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHIP JOBS
OVERSEAS AND GIVE THEM A TAX
BREAK FOR DOING IT.
IF WE CAN'T RUN AGAINST THAT, WE
CAN'T RUN AGAINST ANYONE.
>> Stephen: THE TEA PARTYIST,
WHY DON'T THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ONE
OF THOSE?
I HOPE THEY DON'T.
WHY IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS CAN'T
THEY MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO COME OUT
AND CHANT IN THE STREETS?
>> I THINK THEY CAN AND THEY
SHOULD.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR
RALLY.
>> Stephen: WILL YOU, IF
INVITED, WILL YOU COME TO THE
MARCH TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE?
>> GLADLY.
I'D BE HONORED.
TO ARE YOU KIDDING.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
>> Stephen: I'LL THINK ABOUT
INVITING YOU.
I DON'T INVITE ANYBODY UNTIL
THEY TELL ME THEY'RE COMING
FIRST.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU SAY OBAMA NEEDS AN INVISIBLE
ENEMY TO ATTACK.
RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WOULDN'T IT BE
BETTER FOR THE DEMOCRATS IF THEY
LOST CONGRESS SO OBAMA HAD A
REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO ATTACK IN
2012.
>> Stephen: YOU DID.
THEN CLINTON A YEAR LATER,
GINGRICH SHUT DOWN CONGRESS.
CLINTON SAID, "YOU GO RIGHT
AHEAD," AND THEN...
>> THEN THEY PEACHED HIM FOR
NOTHING, WHICH IS WHAT I THINK
THESE GUYS WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Stephen: I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO GET OBAMA ON
THAT BECAUSE I THINK LEWINSKY IS
TOO OLD TO BE AN INTERN.
>> WELL, OKAY.
>> Stephen: PAUL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST PAUL
