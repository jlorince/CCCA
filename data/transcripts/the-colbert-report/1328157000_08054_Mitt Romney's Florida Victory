LEWIS BLACK.
STAY STRONG, MY BROTHER.
THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE WELCOME, BLACK PEOPLE.
NOW, NATION, TONIGHT, WITH
ROUGHLY 100% OF PRECINCTS
REPORTING, THE "COLBERT REPORT"
IS PREPARED TO PROJECT THAT MITT
ROMNEY WILL WIN THE FLORIDA
PRIMARY 24 HOURS AGO.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU CAN BANK ON THAT.
WE'VE GOT THE BEST ELECTION TEAM
WATCHING TIVO.
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS, MITT DIDN'T JUST BEAT
NEWT GINGRICH.
HE STOMPED HIM BY A DEVASTATING
14% MARGIN, 14%.
THAT IS HIGHER THAN MITT'S TAX
RATE.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
YEAH.
ROMNEY KICKED NEWT TO THE CURB
LIKE A PLANT MANAGER WHOSE JOB
HE JUST MOVED TO ANOTHER
COUNTRY.
( LAUGHTER )
AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DID MITT
DO IT?
BY LAYING OUT HIS POSITIVE
VISION OF A NEGATIVE VISION OF
NEWT GINGRICH.
JIM?
>> WE HAVE A NEW STUDY THAT'S
OUT AND IT SAYS THAT THIS IS THE
MOST NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN IN
HISTORY.
>> WE KNOW THAT IT WAS THE MOST
NEGATIVE ADS EVER IN THE HISTORY
OF FOREVER.
>> THIS IS UNQUESTIONABLY,
CHRIS, THE NASTIEST, DOWN DIRTY,
GUT-FIGHTING, ALLEY-FIGHTING
CAMPAIGN.
>> WHY ISN'T MITT ROMNEY HAPPY?
BECAUSE HE'S RUN A COMPLETELY
DIRTBALL CAMPAIGN THAT NOBODY ON
EARTH WOULD BE PROUD OF.
>> Stephen:  WOW.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT IS SOME HARSH, SPITEFUL,
BASELESS CHARACTER
ASSASSINATION.
CHRIS MATTHEWS SHOULD THINK
ABOUT WORKING FOR ROMNEY.
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE, FOLKS, ROMNEY'S ADS
WERE CRUEL AND THEY WERE
PERSONAL.
>> GINGRICH EXAGGERATES,
DROPPING REAGAN'S NAME 50 TIMES.
BUT IN HIS DIARIES, REAGAN
MENTIONED GINGRICH ONLY ONCE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  EVEN WORSE, HE
WAS UNDERNEATH THIS DOODLE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
REAGAN USED THAT LITTLE BUBBLE
LETTERING.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT.
FOLKS, NEWT FOUGHT BACK WITH A
ROBO CALL OFFERING THIS SUBTLE
CRITIQUE OF MITT'S RECORD.
>> AS GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS,
MITT ROMNEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR
KOSHER FOOD FOR OUR SENIORS IN
NURSING HOMES.
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS WHO FOR THE
FIRST TIME WERE FORCED TO EAT
NON-COIVER BECAUSE ROMNEY
THOUGHT $5 WAS TOO MUCH TO PAY
FOR OUR GRANDPARENTS TO EAT
KOSHER.
>> Stephen:  TOUGH STUFF.
THE WORST THING ABOUT THAT AD?
THE THOUSANDS OF JEWISH
GRANDMOTHERS WHO WERE CRUSHED
WHEN THAT NICE ROBOT STOPPED
CALLING.
"I LOVE YOU,NANA.
I LOVE YOU,NANA.
THANK YOU FOR THE BIRTHDAY
MONEY."
( LAUGHTER )
NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM.
NOW, NEWT MIGHT HAVE HAD THE
WIND KNOCKED OUT OF HIM IN
FLORIDA, BUT LUCKILY HE IS
SELF-INFLATING.
>> TO THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SAID I
WAS DEAD IN JUNE AND JULY AND
SAID I WAS GONE AFTER IOWA, WHO
SEEMED TOTALLY QUIET THE NIGHT
OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY,
AND NOW GOING TO BE BACK SAYING,
"WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?"
I JUST WANT TO REASSURE THEM
TONIGHT.
WE ARE GOING TO CONTEST EVERY
PLACE, AND WE WILL WIN AND WE
WILL BE IN TAMPA AS THE NOMINEE
IN AUGUST.
>> Stephen:  YES!
HE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE!
HE IS USING ALL THE
STICK-TO-IT-IVENESS HE DID NOT
WASTE ON HIS MARRIAGES.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
TO DRIVE HOME HIS COMMITMENT,
NEWT'S CAMPAIGN PRINTED OUT
THESE 46 STATES TO GO POSTERS.
OF COURSE, SINCE NEWT'S NOT EVEN
ON THE BALLOT IN VIRGINIA AND
MISSOURI, THOSE 46 STATES MAY
ACTUALLY REFER TO THE MANY
STATES OF HIS CAMPAIGN INCLUDING
DENIAL, ANGER, ACOUSTIC, CUBIST,
DEPRESSION, EMO, BARGAINING,
TREKKIE, AND FINALLY,
ACCEPTANCE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
SO SETTLE IN, EVERYBODY, SETTLE
IN.
BECAUSE THIS THING WILL NOT BE
OVER.
UNTIL NEWT IS NO LONGER MAD AT
MITT.
I'M GOING TO SAY AROUND STARGATE
8130.3.
I THINK WE HAVE A PREVIEW OF HIS
CONCESSION SPEECH.
>> FROM HELL, I STAB AT THEE.
>> Stephen:  HE LOOKED GOOD.
HE LOOKED GOOD.
I THINK HE'S LOST WEIGHT.
OF COURSE, SOME OUT THERE ARE
SAYING THIS IS GOING TO HURT THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
I JUST SAID IT NOW.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT MITT KNOWS ALL THIS
NEGATIVITY IS ACTUALLY A
POSITIVITY.
JIM.
>> AS THIS PRIMARY UNFOLDS OUR
OPPONENTS IN THE OTHER PARTY
HAVE BEEN WATCHING.
AND THEY LIKE TO COMFORT
THEMSELVES WITH THE THOUGHT THAT
A COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGN WILL
LEAVE US DIVIDED AND WEAK.
BUT I'VE GOT NEWS FOR THEM.
A COMPETITIVE PRIMARY DOES NOT
DIVIDE US.
IT PREPARES US.
>> Stephen:  YES.
BY HAMMERING EACH OTHER DURING
THE PRIMARY, THEY'RE GETTING
PREPARED.
IT'S THE SAME WAY A SPARRING
PARTNER AGAINST THE CHAMP READY
FOR THE BIG FIGHT BY STABBING
HIM IN THE NECK WITH GARDENING
SHEERS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
AND AS A CONSERVATIVE MYSELF, I,
OF COURSE, I, OF COURSE, WANT
THE EVENTUAL NOMINEE TO BE AS
PREPARED AS POSSIBLE.
SO THOUGH IT PAINS ME TO DO SO,
TONIGHT, I AM CREATING A NEW
TWITTER HASHTAG, PREPARE THEM,
TO POST VICIOUS, PERSONAL
ATTACKS AGAINST BOTH OF THESE
GOOD MEN.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
LET'S SEE, UH... LET'S SEE, HERE
WE GO FEBRUARY-- GO FOR NEWT.
NEWT'S ONLY HOPE FOR YOUR VOTE
IS IF YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA FOR
20 YEARS.
AND IF YOU HAVE, HE PROBABLY
DIVORCED YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
NEWT 2012, AND SEND.
OKAY.
ONE FOR MITT.
OKAY, MITT ROMNEY IS NOT A
VULTURE CAPITALIST.
VULTURES ONLY EAT THINGS THAT
ARE DEAD.
ROMNEY 2012, AND SEND.
SO DO THE RIGHT THING, NATION,
AND REALLY TEAR THESE GUYS A NEW
ONE TO, YOU KNOW, HELP.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
