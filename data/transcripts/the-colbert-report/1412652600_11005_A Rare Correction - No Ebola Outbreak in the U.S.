>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR
SUPPORT.
I NEED IT TONIGHT.
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY TOSAY BUT I WANT TO ISSUE A RARE
CORRECTION.
(LAUGHTER)LAST WEEK, I BROKE THE STORY
THAT YOU WOULD SOON BE DEAD
IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE NOT AND,FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE, AS WE ALL KNOW, EBOLA
HAS REACHED AMERICA, BUT EVERSINCE THE FIRST CASE WAS
IDENTIFIED, THE C.D.C. HASSTEPPED IN TO ISOLATE THE VIRUS,
MONITOR ANYONE AT RISK, ANDCONTAIN ANY CHANCE OF FURTHER
INFECTION.
YOU CAN SLEEP SOUNDLY.
THERE WILL BE NO EBOLA OUTBREAKIN THE UNITED STATES...
IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TOBELIEVE!
JIM?
>> ARE AMERICANS BEING TOLD THETRUTH ABOUT THE THREAT OF THIS
VERY DEADLY DISEASE?
>> I HEARD THE C.D.C. CHIEF SAYIT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
I HEARD THE HOSPITAL SAY, DON'TWORRY.
WE HAVE THIS UNDER CONTROL.
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN TRUSTANYONE.
>> AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANSAYS THE C.D.C. IS LYING.
>> THEY HAVE BEEN DOWNPLAYINGTHIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
I DON'T THINK AMERICANS AREGOING TO JUST SIT BACK AND GO,
IT'S COOL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ITTAKEN CARE OF, BECAUSE I DON'T
BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS GOTIT TAKEN CARE OF.
>> THE C.D.C.,THE CENTERS FOR DENIAL AND
CONFUSION ARE DOWNPLAYING THEDANGERS TO AMERICANS ALMOST TO
THE POINT OF LYING TO THEM.
>> STEPHEN: THE C.D.C., THECOALITION FOR DECEPTION AND
COERCION IS LYING!
THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THATTHEY'VE GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.
BUT LOOK AT THEIR TRACK RECORD.
BACK IN THE '90S, THEY LETTHAT INFECTED MONKEY FROM
"OUTBREAK" ESCAPE, THEN HESHARED AN ICE CREAM CONE WITH
ROSS FROM "FRIENDS," AND NOWGWYNETH PALTROW IS DEAD.
(APPLAUSE)SO I DON'T TRUST THE C.D.C. OR
COVEN OF DEVIANTS AND CHARLATANSI LISTEN TO TV PUNDITS BECAUSE
WE TREAT EVERYTHING LIKE IT'STHE END OF THE WORLD.
>> WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JOSHEARNEST SAYS SCREENING
PROCEDURES ARE IN PLACE AT OURBORDER AND PEOPLE ARE SCREENED
AS SOON AS THEY GET HERE.
REALLY?
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
WHAT IS THAT?
YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOUDON'T WANT PEOPLE TO PANIC?
YOU DON'T WANT US TO PANIC?
HOW ABOUT I DON'T WANT US TODIE?
>> STEPHEN: YEAH!
YEAH!
OBAMA WANTS CAN YOU TO LINE UPFOR A CALM AND ORDERLY DEATH.
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE SAYING?
THIS IS MY DEAF EAR?
AND NOBODY'S TALKING?
THEN WHY AM I HEARING VOICES?
IS THAT BECAUSE OF EBOLA?
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S AN UNRELATED MENTALDISORDER?
ALL RIGHT THEN, AS LONG AS IDON'T CATCH WHATEVER PARALYZED
HER EYEBROWS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BAD, BAD! NO, BAD!
POINT IS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTIS INCOMPETENT.
WE SIMPLY CAN'T TRUST THEM TOCONTAIN EBOLA.
IT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO STATES.
AND MY HOME STATE OFSOUTH CAROLINA ALREADY HAS A
POTENTIAL PLAN TO ERADICATE THEVIRUS.
AS FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OFTHE SOUTH CAROLINA G.O.P. AND
CURRENT MIDDLE SCHOOL DEBATECLUB TREASURER, TOM KINCANNON
TWEETED...
THE PROTOCOL FOR A POSITIVEEBOLA TEST SHOULD BE IMMEDIATE,
HUMANE EXECUTION ANDSANITIZATION OF THE WHOLE AREA.
THAT WILL SAVE LIVES.
FINALLY, A WAY TO SAVE LIVES.
HUMANELY EXECUTE THE VICTIM.
OF COURSE, THE SHOTGUN BLAST TOHIS CHEST COULD SPREAD SOME
BODILY FLUIDS.
SO, TO BE SAFE, SOMEONE WILLHAVE TO COMPASSIONATELY MURDER
WHOEVER EXECUTED THE PATIENT.
AND THAT PERSON, OF COURSE, WILLHAVE TO BE SENSITIVELY
BLUDGEONED TO DEATH BY A FOURTHPERSON, AND SO ON UNTIL THE
CHAIN OF HUMANE HOMICIDE MAKESIT BACK TO WHOEVER'S WONDERFUL
IDEA THIS WAS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
