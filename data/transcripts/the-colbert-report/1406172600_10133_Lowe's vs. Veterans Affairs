(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SOMUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOSURPRISE BUT I DO NOT TRUST
THE MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERSWHEN I WANT RELIABLE
NEWSPAPER I ALWAYS TURN TOMY LOCAL PAPERS LIKE THE
STATEN ISLAND ADVANCE, THENUMBER ONE FORCE FOR FINDING
OUT WHOSE GOOMAH WAS SEENEATING GABAGOOL WITH SOME MOOK.
LAST WEEK THE ADVANCEPUBLISHED A HEARTWARMING
LETTER FROM A VIETNAMVETERAN WHO OVER THE PAST
TWO YEARS HAS BEEN WAITINGTO RECEIVE A NEW WHEELCHAIR
FROM THE VA.
TWO YEARS SEEMS LOOK A LONGTIME BUT THEY'RE STILL
FILING PAPERWORK FROM THEWHISKEY REBELLION.
LET'S READ ALL ABOUT THISSTORY BY WATCHING THE TV.
>> MICHAEL SULSONA WENT TO ALOWE'S STORE TO GET FENCING
FOR HIS YARD BUT AS HE WASBROWSING THE BOLTS ON THE
WHEELCHAIR SNAPPED, THESTORE WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE BUT
THE GUY IN THE FENCEDEPARTMENT TOOK HIM TO SEE
THE GUY IN THE BOLTDEPARTMENT.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE WASSITTING IN A LOWE'S PATIO
CHAIR WHILE THREE GUYS FIXEDHIS WHEELCHAIR.
>> THEY JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, IWASN'T LEAVING THERE UNTIL THE
WHEELCHAIR WAS LIKE NEW. WHATREALLY TOUCHED ME WAS WHEN I
THANKED THEM ALL AND THEY JUSTLOOKED AT ME AND THEY JUST SAID
IT WAS THEIR HONOR.
>> THOSE GENTLEMEN MAY HAVEFIGURED THAT WHEELCHAIR BUT
HEARING ABOUT IT, LOOSED AFEW BOLTS IN HERE.
DEDICATED LOWES EMPLOYEESHAVE PROVEN THE PRIVATE
SECTOR DOES EVERYTHINGBETTER THAN THE GOVERNMENT
EVER CAN.
IN FACT, I DON'T SEE WHYDAMN STRAIGHT.
>> I DON'T SEE WHY ALL OURVETERANS HEALTH ISSUES
CANNOT BE HANDLED BY LOWES.
WHY WAIT MONTHS TO HAVE THATHIP REPLACED AT THE VA WHEN
LOWES WILL FIX YOU UP INMINUTES WITH DUCT TAPE,
CHICKEN WIRE AND A SOCKETWRENCH SET.
AND SURE, SOME OLDER VETSOUT THERE NEED MAJOR
PROCEDURES LIKE HEARTTRANSPLANTS BUT REALLY WHAT
IS A HEART OTHER THAN AFOUNTAIN PUMP, ZIP TIED TO
SPRINKLER AND A GARDENHOSE.
I BET THE GOOD FOLKS AT LOWESCAN ONLY HANDLE MENTAL
HEALTH.
THE WORST CASE OF PTSD IN THEWORLD IS NO MATCH FOR THIS
ADORABLE FROG STATUE USING ADAISY FOR AN UMBRELLA.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAWGOING DOOR-TO-DOOR IN
FALLUJAH.
LOOK AT THAT GUY'S TUMMY.
IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOUHAPPY, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
BETTER.
(LAUGHTER)SO LOWES, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
SERVICE TO THOSE WE AREINSUFFICIENTLY THANKING FOR
THEIR SERVICE.
BUT I DO HAVE ONE CRITICISM,LOWES.
YOUR BATHROOMS.
THERE'S JUST NO DAMNPRIVACY.
AND I HAVE YET TO FIND ONETOILET THAT FLUSHES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
