ALWAYS ADMIRED JUSTICE
CLARENCE THOMAS.
THE MAN IS A ROCK IN THAT HE
COULD BE REPLACED BY A ROCK,
I'M NOT SURE ANYONE WOULD
NOTICE.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE NEXT WEEK WILL MARK
A VERY SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY
FOR THOMAS.
>> WHEN THE SUPREME COURT
RETURNS FROM ITS WINTER
BREAK LATER THIS MONTH JUDGE
CLARENCE THOMAS WILL PASS A
SILENT MILESTONE OF NOT
SPEAKING DURING COURT
ARGUMENT.
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS HE'S
NOT QUESTIONED LAWYERS AS
THEY PRESENT THEIR CASES.
NO OTHER SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE HAS GONE A COMPLETE
TERM WITHOUT SPEAKING DURING
ARGUMENTS.
>> NO ONE ELSE IN THE
HISTORY OF THE COURT HAS NOT
TALKED FOR EVEN ONE TERM.
THIS MAN'S GONE FIVE!
HE'S SILENT.
AND IF YOU ARE'S ARGUING A
DEATH ROW CASE, HE IS SILENT
BUT DEADLY.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW SOME SAY HIS SILENCE
SHOWS A LACK OF JUDICIAL
ABILITY.
THAT IS NONSENSE.
IF HE DOESN'T NEED TO ASK
ANY QUESTIONS TO ARRIVE AT A
RULING, IT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE
THING.
CLARENCE THOMAS IS PSYCHIC.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THOUGH APPARENTLY HE CAN
ONLY READ ONE MIND.
BUT OF COURSE, BUT OF COURSE
THOMAS HAS COME UNDER
ATTACK.
THIS TIME FROM LEFT WING
LEGAL LOON'S COMMON CAUSE.
FIRST THEY RAISE A BIG STINK
JUST BECAUSE THOMAS DIDN'T
REPORT HIS WIFE'S INCOME OF
NEARLY $700,000 SHE EARNED
FROM THE CONSERVATIVE
HERITAGE FOUNDATION.
NOTHING TO SEE HERE, FOLKS.
BECAUSE THOMAS EXPLAINED
THAT HIS WIFE'S EARNINGS
WERE QUOTE INADVERT ENTLY
OMITTED DUE TO A
MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE
FILING ING STRUCTIONS.
HOW WAS HE SUPPOSED TO
UNDERSTAND FILING
INSTRUCTIONS?
THE MAN IS ONLY ONE OF THE
NINE MOST BRILLIANT LEGAL
MINDS IN THE COUNTRY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE
BYZANTINE MAZE OF MUMBO
JUMBO CLARENCE THOMAS HAD TO
WADE THROUGH ON HIS ACTUAL
FINANCIAL-DISCLOSURE FORM.
SPOUSES NONINVESTMENT
INCOME.
AND OF COURSE HE CHECKED
NONE.
HE HAD TO, THERE WAS NO BOX
FOR $700,000.
AND NOW, FOLKS, COMMON CAUSE
IS ACCUSING THIS JUDICIAL
MARCEL MARCEAUX OF CONFLICT
OF INTEREST.
JIM?
>> CLARENCE THOMAS APPEARED
AT A FUND-RAISER, A SECRET
FUND-RAISER SPONSORED BY THE
KOCH BROTHERS, THE TWO
INDIVIDUALS WHO FUND LOTS OF
RIGHT WING CAUSES, AT THE
VERY SAME TIME THAT THEY
WERE DECIDING THE CITIZEN'S
UNITED CASE WHICH RESOUNDED
TO THE BENEFIT GREATLY OF
THE KOCH BROTHERS.
>> Stephen: YOU SEE THE
SUPREME COURT CITIZENS
UNITED DECISION ALLOWED
CORPORATIONS LIKE KOCH
INDUSTRIES TO ANONYMOUSLY
MAKE UNLIMITED DONATIONS TO
CANDIDATES.
WHICH IS WHY IN 2012 THE
REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER IS A
BARREL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE.
(LAUGHTER)
AGAIN, AGAIN, FOLKS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THE CROWD LIKES
BARREL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AGAIN, FOLKS,
THIS IS MUCH ADO ABOUT
BUPKUS BECAUSE A SPOKESWOMAN
FOR THOMAS CALLED HIS
APPEARANCE AT THE COKE
RETREAT A BRIEF DROP BY.
NOW SURE IN HIS
FINANCIAL-DISCLOSURE REPORT
THOMAS SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN
PAID AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT
FOR FOUR DAYS OF
TRANSPORTATION MEALS AND
ACCOMMODATIONS BUT WHY CAN'T
IT BE BOTH?
YOU KNOW HOW THESE
BILLIONAIRE POLITICAL
RETREATS ARE.
YOU PLAN TO JUST DROP BY,
MAYBE EAT SOME CALFIER OUT
OF A TIGER PAW OR GO TO A DO
DO KOKH FIGHT AND DO SHOTS
OF SING ELEVATOR-- SINGLE
MALT ORPHAN TEARS AND THEN
MOVE.
AND FOUR DAYS LATER YOU WAKE
UP IN BED WITH WALT DISNEY'S
FROZEN HEAD.
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
BESIDES, FOLKS T IS PATENTLY
RIDICULOUS TO THINK CLARENCE
THOMAS DECIDED CITIZEN'S
UNITED BASED ON A WEEKEND
GET AWAY WITH THESE
BILLIONAIRE BROTHERS.
JUST ASK REPUBLICAN FORMER
FEC COMMISSIONER BRADLEY
SMITH.
>> JUSTICE THOMAS HAS BEEN
ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR
OVER 20 YEARS.
HE HAS VOTED TO STRIKE DOWN
AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL EVERY
SINGLE CAMPAIGN FINANCE CASE
THAT HAS COME BEFORE HIM IN
THAT TIME.
>> Stephen: SEE?
CLARENCE THOMAS ALWAYS RULES
ON THE SIDE OF MORE
CORPORATE INFLUENCE IN OUR
ELECTIONS.
SO THIS TRIP TO PALM SPRINGS
WASN'T A BRIBE.
IT WAS A REWARD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT NO ONE,
FOLKS, NO ONE CAN DO A
BETTER JOB DEFENDING THIS
HUMAN MUTE BUTTON THAN THE
MAN HIMSELF.
>> SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE WELCOME LIVE VIA
PHONE, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
CLARENCE THOMAS.
GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: JUSTICE THOMAS,
ARE YOU THERE?
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY, THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S HIM.
SIR, HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO
THE SCURRILOUS ACCUSATIONS?
OKAY, LOUD AND CLEAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ON A RELATED SUBJECT, A LOT
OF PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED
CITIZEN'S UNITED FOR-- (TOILET
FLUSHING).
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY YOUR
HONOR, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
WERE ON THE BENCH.
AS I WAS SAYING-- WAIT, ARE
YOU WATCHING THE DALEY SHOW?
COME ON!
