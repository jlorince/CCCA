OF COURSE, FOLKS, THE BIGSTORY OVER THANKSGIVING WAS
THE ONGOING RACIAL TENSIONSIN AMERICA.
WE JUST GAVE YOU THE JACKIEROBINSON STORMTROOPER.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
AND IT WAS ALL OVER ONETINY DECISION.
>> A GRAND JURY DECIDED NOTTO INDICT OFFICER DARREN
WILSON IN THE SHOOTING DEATHOF MICHAEL BROWN.
>> HUNDREDS SWARMED THEFEDERAL COURTHOUSE BEFORE
FANNING OUT THROUGH THE CITYSTREETS.
>> THE COURTHOUSE ISBARRICADED.
THE SIDEWALK BLOCKED.
PROTESTS OVERNIGHT MOVEDFROM FERGUSON TO ST. LOUIS.
>> YES, FERGUSON HAS ERUPTEDBECAUSE OFFICER DARREN
WILSON WILL NOT FACE TRIAL.
FOR SOME REASON, THESEPROTESTORS WON'T TAKE "ITS
LEGAL TO SHOOT AN UNARMED BLACKMAN" FOR AN ANSWER.
FOLKS, THESE DEMONSTRATIONSHAVE BEEN A SOBERING
REMINDER THAT ST. LOUIS EXISTS
I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSEDTO LEAVE AGES AGO THROUGH
THAT STAR GATE THEY BUILT.
NOW-- NOW, NOW WOULD BE AGOOD TIME, GUYS. VERY NICE.
>> AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH THATTHEY DESTROYED IT FERGUSON.
THESE PROTESTS HAVESPREAD TO WHAT AMERICANS HOLD
MOST SACRED, FOOTBALL.
>> THE EVENTS IN FERGUSONHAVE CROSSED OVER INTO THE
WORLD OF SPORTS.
>> FIVE PLAYERS OF THE ST.LOUIS RAMS PUT THEIR HANDS
OVER THEIR HEADS IN A DON'TSHOOT POSE RIGHT BEFORE
THEIR GAME AGAINST THEOAKLAND RAIDERS.
>> WELL THAT IS JUSTWRONG.
WHY WOULD ANYONE SURRENDERTO THE RAIDERS?
THANKFULLY, WHEN THE ST.LOUIS POLICE, SEE YOUNG
BLACK MEN WITH THEIR HANDSIN THE AIR, THEY COME OUT
FIRING.
>> THE ST. LOUIS POLICEOFFICER ASSOCIATION IS
CONDEMNING THE PLAYER'SACTIONS CALLING THE MOVE
TASTELESS, OFFENSIVE ANDINFLAMMATORY.
>> YES IT IS TASTELESS ANDOFFENSIVE TO SEE THIS AT
THAT TIME AN NFL GAME.
WHICH REMINDS ME, WELCOMEBACK, RAY RICE, WE'VE MISSED
YOU.
AND THE YOU HAVE TO STOPTHAT OFFENSIVE GESTURE
BEFORE IT SPREADS.
DURING THE GAME I SAWREFEREES DO IT A BUNCH OF
TIMES.
THEY BUILT GIANT STEELMONUMENTS TO IT AT EACH
END OF THE FIELD.
LATER THE CROWD EVEN PASSEDIT AROUND THE STADIUM IN SOME
KIND OF CELEBRATION.
THE POINT IS, THESE PLAYERSSHOULD BE PUNISHED.
I SAY WE MAKE THEM PLAYFOOTBALL USING ONLY THEIR
FEET WITH SOME KIND OFPENALTY FOR TOUCHING IT WITH
THEIR HANDS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THINGS WOULD BE A LOTCALMER IF BLACK PEOPLE JUST
AGREED NEVER TO PUT THEIRHANDS UP.
OR IN THEIR POCKETSAS SEEN IN THIS ENCOUNTER
WITH THE POLICE OFFICERBEING FILMED BY A BLACK MAN
WHO ASKED WHY HE WAS BEINGSTOPPED.
>> YOU'RE MAKING PEOPLENERVOUS.
>> BY WALKING BY?
>> YEAH, THEY SAID YOU HADYOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS.
>> WOW, WALKING BY WITHYOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS
MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS TO CALLTHE POLICE WHEN IT'S SNOWING
OUTSIDE?
>> WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TODAY?
>> WALKING, WITH MY HANDS INMY POCKETS.
>> YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'TTRUST SOMEONE WITH THEIR
HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS.
POCKETS ARE THE HOLSTER OFTHE FIST.
THE POINT IS, THERE ARE JUSTSOME GESTURES THAT
BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD NOTATTEMPT RIGHT NOW.
>> OKAY.
HANDS UP, TOO INFLAMMATORY.HANDS IN POCKETS, TOO
THREATENING.
THIS TRICK, LOOKS LIKEYOU'RE STEALING THE THUMB
OKAY.
ALSO, AVOID-- JAZZ HANDS!
OKAY.
BECAUSE JAZZ HANDS LEAD TOHEROIN HANDS, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
AND NO, I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT,OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR A COPTO YELL HE'S GOT A SPOUT,
START FIRING.
AND THE MOST THREATENINGTHING A BLACK PERSON CAN DO
IS HERE'S THE CHURCH, HERE'STHE STEEPLE, BECAUSE WHEN
YOU OPEN THE DOORS LOOK ATALL THE BLACK PEOPLE, THAT
COULD BE A RIOT
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TEARGASSED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
