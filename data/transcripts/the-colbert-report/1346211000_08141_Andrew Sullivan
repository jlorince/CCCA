>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, IS THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY BEEF, THE DISH, AND A CONSERVATIVE WHO SUPPORTS
BARACK OBAMA.
I'M SORRY.
I MEAN HE IS THE CONSERVATIVE WHO SUPPORTS BARACK OBAMA.
PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW SULLIVAN!  ANDREW, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: IT IS SUMMER.
IT IS FANTASTIC.
NOW, FOUR YEARS AGO YOU WERE AN EARLY CONSERVATIVE TO COME OUT IN FAVOR OF BARACK OBAMA AND SAY
HE IS THE GUY.
THE GUY YOU SPECIFICALLY SAID TO LEAD US AWAY FROM THE SORT OF FIGHTS OVER THE CULTURE WARS AND VIETNAM.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE WRONG.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR GIVING PEOPLE A HOPE OF CHANGE?
>> NO.
I WAS ONLY WRONG IN THINKING THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MIGHT JUST HAVE THE GOOD GRACE AND
PATRIOTISM TO ACTUALLY COOPERATE WITH AN INCOMING PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE HOPING -- YOU WERE HOPING DON'T, DON'T
CHEER BEFORE I NAIL HIM.
>> YOU WERE HOPING THEY WOULD PUSSY OUT AND SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE, BARACK OBAMA, DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT AND WE WILL GIVE UP ON OUR BELIEFS.
>> I THINK WHEN YOU JUST ELECTED A PRESIDENT AND IN THE BOSTON DEPRESSION SINCE THE 1930S YOU
MAY GET MORE THAN ZERO VOTES ON THE FIRST SUM STIMULUS PACKAGE.
THEY SET OUT TO DESTROY THIS GUY FROM THE GET-GO AND THAT IS WHY RE-ELECTING HIM IS SO IMPORTANT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
SO YOU STILL SUPPORT --
>> MORE ZERO NOW THAN IN 2008.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?  WHY?
>> BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DELIVER AND THE PARTIES ARE WHO WORST THAN LAST TIME.
>> Stephen: THEY WEREN'T THE PRESIDENT.
EIGHT PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: EIGHT PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT.
DON'T APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> MOST UNDERSTAND THAT RECESSION BEGAN -- NOT DURING OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY.
IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN AND LOOK AT AMERICA -- OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD ARE WORST THAN THE UNITED
STATES AND HE HAS DONE BETTER THAN ANY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE LAST
THREE YEARS, AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT OBAMA IS THE ONLY WAY WE REALLY WILL TACKLE THE DEBT, AND
AS A CONSERVATIVE I CARE ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: BUT THE DEBT IS $16 TRILLION.
>> YES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET REVENUES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE
IS NO GROWTH, BECAUSE WE ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM RECESSION.
>> Stephen: BUT HE HAS STRANGLING REGULATIONS.
>> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF ANYMORE REGULATIONS.
>> Stephen: NO, BECAUSE HE BURIED THE EVIDENCE.
HE BURIED IT.
>> IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CUT THE DEBT AND YOU REALLY WANT TO DO --
>> Stephen: I REALLY DO.
>> YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE COOPERATION BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, YOU HAVE TO
HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS ABLE TO COMPROMISE AND THE ONE THING WE KNOW THAT ROMNEY AND RYAN WON'T
DO ON ANYTHING IS COMPROMISE.
WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF DEAL BETWEEN DEMOCRATS, CUT ENTITLEMENTS AND FOR REPUBLICANS
TO INCREASE TAXES AND CUTTING DEFINITE.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT.
>> Stephen: CUTTING DEFENSE?
>> A LITTLE BIT MORE, YES.
>> Stephen: OH, REALLY?  OKAY.
SO TURN THE KEYS OVER TO THE TERRORISTS.
>> BECAUSE --
>> Stephen: ONE OF THE BIG PARTS THAT GETS YOU INVITED TO ALL OF THE BEST PARTIES IS THAT
YOU ARE THIS CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE WHO SEEMS TO BE LIKE THE REASONABLE ONE.
THEY ARE NOT CONSERVATIVE.
YOU ARE NOT.
YOU HAVE AN ENGLISH ACCENT.
>> THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A CONSERVATIVE.
BY THE WAY, DO YOU AND PIERCE MORGAN AND SUE BARNEY GET TOGETHER, EVER?
>> NO, WE DON'T, ACTUALLY WE DON'T.
>> Stephen: WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY IS YOU GUYS HAVING AN OPINION ABOUT AMERICA.
>> WELL I HAVE A GREEN CARD SO -- (BLEEP).
NOW, I LOVE WATCHING PIERCE MORGAN AT HOME AND MAKING IDLE COMMENTATOR ABOUT HIS BRILLIANT INSIGHTS.
>> Stephen: OH, HE DOES?
>> YES, HE ALSO REMIND ONE OF WHAT WE CALL IN BRITAIN A (BLEEP).
>> Stephen: OKAY.
OKAY.
SO LET'S FANTASIZE HERE FOR A SECOND.
OKAY.
YOU HAVE GOT A SECOND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DA -- HOW DO YOU GET YOUR BEAK WET ON THIS ONE?  WHAT IS IN IT FOR YOU,
MR. SULLIVAN?  YOU ARE A GAY GUY, RIGHT?  NO OFFENSE.
RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HE IS PRO GAY MARRIAGE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN'T BE AN IMPARTIAL PERSON ON THIS ONE.
YOU SHOULD RECUSE YOURSELF FROM ALL OPINIONS.
RIGHT?  ISN'T THE GAY COMMUNITY ALL IN FOR HIM BECAUSE HE PANDERED --
>> NO.
>> Stephen: HE PANDERED BIOBEIGE HIS CONSCIENCE?
>> A LOT OF GAY PEOPLE ARE -- NOT ALL.
A LOT ARE IN BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR CIVIL
RIGHTS, AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT, AND --
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> AND I BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING TWO MEN OR WOMEN TO MARRY IS A CONSERVATIVE IDEA, IT FOSTERS
RESPONSIBILITY, MUTUAL CARE, ALL OF THOSE VALUES THAT CONSERVATIVES SAY THEY BELIEVE
IN AND I STILL BELIEVE IN THOSE VALUES, AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN BIGOTRY AND FANATACISM THAT HAS
TAKEN OVER THIS PARTY AND I HOPE THAT WE MIGHT BREAK THAT FEVER AND BRING CONSERVATIVISM BACK TO
THE CENTER, WHERE WE NEED IT, WE NEED IT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IF THE FEVER BREAKS PLEASE COME BACK AND WE WILL TAKE THE TEMPERATURE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
ANDREW SULLIVAN.
THE DIG AT THE DAILY BEEF.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
