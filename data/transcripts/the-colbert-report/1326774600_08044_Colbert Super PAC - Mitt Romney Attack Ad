I KNOW I DO.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG
STORY IN SOUTH CAROLINA
RIGHT NOW IS ALL THE
NEGATIVE ADS.
ROMNEY'S SUPERPAC ATTACKS
GINGRICH, GINGRICH'S
SUPERPAC ATTACKS ROMNEY.
AND THIS WEEKEND A-- A GROUP
CALLING ITSELF THE
DEFINITELY NOT COORDINATING
WITH STEPHEN COLBERT
SUPERPAC UNVEILED WHAT I
BELIEVE IS THE MOST SHOCKING
ATTACK AD YET.
>> CORPORATIONS, AMERICA'S
GREATEST INSTITUTION, THEY
BUILT THIS COUNTRY ONE JOB
AT A TIME.
MITT ROMNEY SAYS HE'S FOR
CORPORATIONS.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
MY FRIENDS.
>> BUT MITT ROMNEY HAS A
SECRET.
S AHEAD OF BAIN CAPITAL HE
BOUGHT COMPANIES, CARVED
THEM UP AND GOT RID OF WHAT
HE COULDN'T USE.
IF MITT ROMNEY REALLY
BELIEVES.
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
MY FRIEND.
>> THEN MITT ROMNEY IS A
SERIAL KILLER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> MITT THE RIPPER.
AND YOU BELIEVE CORPORATIONS
ARE PEOPLE, DO YOUR DUTY AND
PROTECT THEM.
ON SATURDAY JANUARY 21st,
STOP MITT THE RIPPER BEFORE
HE KILLS AGAIN.
AMERICANS FOR A BETTER
TOMORROW TOMORROW ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT
OF THIS ADVERTISING.
>> Stephen: WOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SHOCKING,
SHOCKING STUFF.
SO IS MITT ROMNEY A SERIAL
KILLER?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THAT QUESTION IS OUT
THERE NOW.
OF COURSE THE GANG THAT
COULDN'T REPORT STRAIGHT
ASSUMES I HAD SOMETHING TO
DO WITH IT.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT'S
SUPERPAC HITS THE AIRWAVES
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> STEPHEN COLBERT, HERE IS
ONE OF HIS SUPERPAC ADS.
>> LEAVE IT TO STEPHEN
COLBERT TO TAKE THESE ADS TO
THE EXTREME.
>> Stephen: FOLKS, ONCE
AGAIN, I NEED TO MAKE IT AS
CLEAR AS THE BLEACH MITT
ROMNEY MAY OR MAY NOT USE TO
DISSOLVE THE BONES OF HIS
VICTIMS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS COMMERCIAL IS THE SOLE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERSON
I TURNED MY PAC OVER TO FOUR
DAYS AGO, A MAN NAMED AND I
HOPE I AM PRONOUNCING THIS
CORRECTLY JON STEW-WART,
UGLY NAME.
AND IF ONE WORD OF THAT AD
IS INACCURATE, I HOPE HE
TAKES IT OFF THE AIR AND
LEAVES IT ON THE INTERNET.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FOLK, LEGALLY, I CAN'T
MAKE HIM DO THAT.
WE CANNOT IN ANY WAY
COORDINATE, EVEN THOUGH WE
CURRENTLY CO-OWN A
COMBINATION BAGEL SHOP AND
TRAVEL AGENCY FROM SHMEAR TO
ETERNITY.
WE BOOK ADVENTURE TRAVEL TO
PLACES WHERE BAGELS ARE NOT
AVAILABLE, AND GIVE OUR
CLIENTS A BAG OF FRESH
BAGELS TO TAKE WITH THEM.
BECAUSE SOMEONE IN K-2 IS
NICE AND ALL BUT BRUNCHING
ON K-2 IS A MEMORY OF A
LIFETIME.
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE
POTENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE
SUPERPAC OWNER KEEP THEIR
OPERATIONS SEPARATE.
MITT ROMNEY KNOWS WHAT
HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T.
>> WE GO TO THE BIG HOUSE.
>> Stephen: YES.
WE GO TO THE BIG HOUSE.
SO THE SAUCE PAN, THE A
CREAM, FRONT PORCH, THE BEAN
BAG, THE KOI POND.
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS JON HAS
HIRED MY SUPERPAC STAFF TO
WORK FOR HIM.
AND THEY ARE STILL IN MY
BUILDING SHARING OFFICES
WITH MY STAFF WHO ARE
EXPLORING OUR POSSIBLE
PRESIDENTIAL RUN.
BUT WE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY
COORDINATING.
WE ARE INSTEAD MEETING THE
HIGH STANDARD SET BY
POLITICAL MASTER SCALP CARL
ROVE-- KARL ROVE WHOSE
AMERICAN CROSS OWED SUPERPAC
SUPERPAC-- FOR CARL FORTI
OPERATES BLACK ROCK
CONSULTANT WHO MAKE ADS FOR
THE MITT ROMNEY CAMPAIGN.
YES, ONE HAND WASHES THE
OTHER BUT THEY DO IT IN
SEPARATE BATHROOMS.
AND HERE'S HOW WE AT THE
REPORT KEEP IT STRAIGHT.
NOW TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T
INADVERTENTLY COORDINATE,
WE'VE ACTUALLY SPLIT THE
STAFF INTO RED TEAM AND BLUE
TEAM.
RED TEAM, SUPERPAC.
BLUE TEAM, EXPLORATORY
COMMITTEE.
NOW THE BLUE TEAM WEARS RED
SHIRTS THAT SAY BLUE TEAM IN
YELLOW WHILE THE RED TEAM
WEARS BLUE SHIRTS THAT SAY
RED TEAM IN GREEN, OKAY.
I HAVE CONSULTED A PARALEGAL
AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT
ALL OF THIS IS PARALEGAL.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW JAY, THE INTERN, WHY
DON'T YOU JUST RUN-- GRAB ME
A CUP OF COFFEE O BUDDY.
>> SORRY, STEPHEN, I'M RED
TEAM, I CAN'T COORDINATE
WITH YOU.
>> Stephen: GOOD MAN, JAY,
STAY VIGILANT NO
COORDINATION.
OKAY, NOW SERIOUSLY G GET ME
THAT COFFEE.
OKAY, THANKS.
HE IS TOTALLY GOING TO JAIL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
