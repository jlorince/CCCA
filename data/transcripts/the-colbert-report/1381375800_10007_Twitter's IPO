THE LATEST TWITTER NEWS.

WALL STREET ABUZZ, THE TECHWORLD ABUZZ ABOUT ITS ONE
BILLION DOLLAR I.P.O. PLAN.

OF THE YEAR.
>> THE I.P.O. IS EXPECTED TO BETHE MOST DESIRABLE SINCE
FACEBOOK'S DEBUT LAST MAY.
>> Stephen: YES!
AND I MADE $2 MILLION ONFACEBOOK BY NOT INVESTING $3
MILLION IN FACEBOOK.

TO BE HUGE.
AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOPTWEETMEN, I AM SURE TO RAKE IN
THE CASH BECAUSE I HAVE OVERFIVE MILLION FOLLOWERS, SEVERAL
OF WHICH ARE NOT UKRAINIAN PORNBOTS.

MILLION FOLLOWERS THAT I'VE GOT,OKAY, AND YOU DIVIDE THAT BY A
BILLION DOLLAR I.P.O., THENMULTIPLY THAT BY THE AMOUNT OF I
GET PAID PER TWEET, I AM SET TOLINE MY POCKETS WITH --

THEIR MONEY DOWN THE SHEETER.
