>> STEPHEN: ON JUNE 17, 1972,FIVE MEN WERE ARRESTED FOR
BREAKING INTO THE DEMOCRATICNATIONAL COMMITTEE'S

CONNECTED THE WATERGATE BREAK-INTO AN ELITE WHITE HOUSE DIRTY
TRICKS GROUP KNOWN AS "THEPLUMBERS "  BECAUSE THEY WERE
TASKED WITH PLUGGING LEAKS.
AND BECAUSE OF THEIR AMPLE ASSCRACKS.
(LAUGHTER)THE PLUMBERS WERE PART OF
NIXON'S POLITICAL OPERATION, THE"COMMITTEE TO RE-ELECT THE
PRESIDENT," OR "CREEP."
A NAME THAT SOMEHOW ESCAPED THESCRUTINY OF "NIXON'S
UNDERCOMMITTEE FOR TERMINATINGSELF-INDICTING ACRONYM CHOICES,"
OR "NUTSAC."

MATE, THEY HAVE TO WATCH OTHERPANDAS DOING IT.
