>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW,I TRY NOT TO REPEAT MYSELF, BUT
I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU, I HAVELONG WARNED YOU ABOUT THE
SCOURGE OF GAY MARRIAGE.
WELL, YESTERDAY, ITMAN-ON-MANAGED TO SPREAD TO THE
PLACE I CARE ABOUT THE THE MOST.
>> A GROUNDBREAKING RULING ASSOUTH CAROLINA BECOMES THE
33rd STATE IN THE NATION TORECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> A FEDERAL JUDGE IN SOUTHCAROLINA STRIKING DOWN THAT
STATE'S BAN ON SAME-SEXMARRIAGE.
>> THE JUDGE IN SOUTH CAROLINARULED THAT STATE'S BAN WAS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> Stephen: A FEDERAL JUDGEHAS RULED THAT SOUTH CAROLINA
MUST RECOGNIZE GAY MARRIAGE?
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS!
WHEN DID SOUTH CAROLINA STARTRECOGNIZING THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )FOLKS, I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
FOLKS AS A NATIVE SON OF THEPALMETTO STATE, I AM DEEPLY
DISTURBED.
THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT HASHAPPENED TO SOUTH CAROLINA SINCE
SOMEONE FOUND MARK SANFORD.
( APPLAUSE )THIS RULING IS A SURRENDER TO
THE GAY AGENDA, OR AS WE CALLIT, THE WAR OF SAME-SEX
AGGRESSION.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEFLAG FLYING ON OUR STATE CAPITOL
GROUNDS WILL LOOK LIKE THIS.
AND, FOLKS, IT IS THE STARS ANDBARS, NOT THE STARS AND GAY
BARS.
, OF COURSE, IN ALL OF THIS,THERE IS ONE PERSON I FEEL MOST
FOR HERE-- ME.
BECAUSE SOUTH CAROLINA IS WHEREI
TRADITIONALLY MARRIED MY FEMALEWIFE WOMAN, LORRAINE.
AS GOD INTENDED.
AND AS WAS THE ONLY LEGAL OPTIONAT THE TIME.
( LAUGHTER )SENT, YEARS LATER, YEARS AFTER I
HAVE SPENT WITH MY BEAUTIFULBRIDE, ALL OF THAT SEEMS LIKE A
TOTAL WASTE.
I MEAN-- I-- WOULD I HAVEGOTTEN GAY MARRIED IF I COULD AT
THE TIME?
, OF COURSE, NOT.
DID I HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND?
WHO'S ASKING?
WAS IT BRAD?
DOES HE EVER MENTION ME?
I, FOR ONE, WILL NEVER FORGIVETHIS ACTIVIST JUDGE WHO BROUGHT
GAY MARRIAGE TO MY STATE ANDWHOSE NAME WILL LIVE IN INFAMY,
RICHARD GERGEL.
IN FACT, I WOULD BE SHOCKED IFAFTER THIS SCANDALOUS GAY
MARRIAGE RULING ANYONE IN SOUTHCAROLINA EVER NAMED THEIR CHILD
DICK GERGEL.
BECAUSE YOU, SIR, YOU, HAVEFOREVER TARNISHED THE REPUTATION
OF OUR FAIR STATE!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YOU HAVE FOREVER TARNISHED THE
REPUTATION OF OUR STATE, WHICHSAYS A LOT BECAUSE SOUTH
CAROLINA HAS DONE SOME( BLEEP ).
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
