WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOW!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS NATION, YOU KNOW YEARS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS GOING
TO COME DOWN TO A FEW UNDECIDED VOTERS IN KEY SWING STATES.
THE FATE OF OUR COUNTRY NOW IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT UNTIL
THEY GET RIGHT UP TO THE REGISTER McDONALD'S.
(LAUGHTER) AND ONE-- ONE OF THOSE KEY SWING STATES IS NEVADA WHERE, SINCE
1978 THEIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BALLOT GIVES VOTERS THE OPTION
TO CHOOSE "NONE OF THE ABOVE." (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW, FOLKS, THE NEVADA
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS GONE TO COURT TO HAVE "NONE OF THE ABOVE" TAKEN OFF THE BALLOT
BECAUSE, AS THE "NATIONAL JOURNAL" PUT IT, IN NEVADA NONE
IS A FEARSOME FOE FOR THE G.O.P.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT.
NEVADA REPUBLICANS ARE SCARED THAT "NONE OF THE ABOVE" COULD TAKE VOTES FROM MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, I TELL YOU, I THINK THEY'VE GOT GROUNDS HERE.
REMEMBER, MITT'S NOT TELLS US HOW HE'S GOING TO FIX THE ECONOMY OR WHAT TAX LOOPHOLES
HE'S GOING TO CLOSE OR WHAT HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY IS GOING TO BE.
THE WHOLE MESSAGE OF HIS CAMPAIGN IS "I'M NOT BARACK OBAMA!" (LAUGHTER)
AND YOU CAN'T GET MORE NOT BARACK OBAMA THAN NO ONE.
(LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, THIS GUY... THIS GUY RIGHT HERE, HE'S GOT THE
CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS THAT ROMNEY LACKS.
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO TALK SMALL GOVERNMENT, THIS GUY BELIEVES IN NONE GOVERNMENT.
(LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT I THINK ROMNEY'S GOT TO DO.
"NONE OF THE ABOVE" IS SO APPEALING TO REPUBLICAN VOTERS I BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY HAS GOT TO
CHOOSE HIM AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, LOOK AT WHO HE'S CONSIDERING NOW.
PORTMAN, PAWLENTY AND JINDAL?
THEY WISH THEY HAD THE CHARISMA OF NONE OF THE ABOVE!
(LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE, I CANNOT SAY FOR SURE THAT NONE OF THE
ABOVE WOULD EVEN ACCEPT THE V.P.
SLOT BECAUSE DESPITE REPEATED CALLS, HE HAS NOT MADE HIMSELF
