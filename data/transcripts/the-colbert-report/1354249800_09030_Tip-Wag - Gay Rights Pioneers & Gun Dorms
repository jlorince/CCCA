(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IF YOU ASK ME, YOU SHOULDN'T BE ASKING ME BECAUSE I ASK THE QUESTIONS
AROUND HERE.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, ONE OF THE VERY BIGGEST LOSERS OF THE RECENT ELECTION WAS TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
YOU SEE THREE MORE STATES LEGALIZED GAY MARRIAGE.
NO SURPRISE THAT ONE OF THE NEW STATES IS WASHINGTON.
WHAT DOW EXPECT FROM A STATE NAMED FOR A GUY WHO WEARS Q-- CAPRI SLACKS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT ONE OF THE STATE'S BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, BOEING, A NAME SYNONYMOUS WITH
AEROSPACE EXCELLENCE AND BONNER SOUND EFFECTS HAS INDICATED IN UNION CONTRACT TALKS THAT THEY WILL DENY
EQUAL PENSION BENEFITS TO MARRIED GAY EMPLOYEES.
HEY, HEY, YEAH, I'M ANGRY AT THE GAYS TOO.
HEY, GAY BOEING PLORX THE ONLY MARRIAGE YOU SHOULD HAVE IS TO YOUR JOB UNLESS YOUR JOB IS IN THE COCKPIT.
(LAUGHTER) WELL-- FOLKS, TO COMMEMORATE THIS REFRESHING DENIAL OF HUMAN DIGNITY, I'M GIVING A
TIP OF MY HADD TO BOEING FOR BEING GAY RIGHTS PIONEERS.
KUZ IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS IS GREAT FOR THE GAYS.
IF COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO PAY OUT SURVIVOR PENSIONS FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES IT WILL
SAVE THE MILLIONS.
SOON EVERY COMPANY WILL WANT THEM.
THERE WILL BE A GAY JOB EXPLOSION.
BOY THE WAY DO NOT GOOGLE THE TERM GAY JOB-- NATION, THIS BLATANT DEVALUING OF GAY PARTNERS IS GREAT FOR
ANY COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE.
OR TOP LINE, HE WOULDN'T KNOW, I'M NOT INTO THAT LIFESTYLE.
FOLKS, NEXT UP ON-- THE WAG THING I AS THE KIDS CALL IT, MI SUCH A STANCH SUPPORTER
OF THE RIGHT TO BEAR FIREARMS THAT I'M UP SET WE CAN'T BEAR FIRE LEGS.
THAT'S TOO LIMBS THAT AREN'T SHOOTING SOMETHING.
SO YOU KNOW I WAS PUMPED AS A 12 GAUGE TO SEE THE STUDENTS WITH GUN PERMITS CAN GET THEIR OWN SEGREGATED
DORMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO.
FOREVER INSURANCING THAT NO ONE WILL THINK OF IT AS A SAFETY SCHOOL.
BUT FOLKS, I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO GIVE A WAG OF MY FINGER AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO
STUDENTS BECAUSE NOT ONE SIGNED UP TO LIVE IN THE GUN DORM.
COME ON.
THIS IS COLLEGE.
TIME TO GET CRAZY.
DO SHOTS, TAKE SHOTS, GET SHOT.
MAYBE JOIN A FRATERNITY LIKE I'M A POPPA CAPA.
(APPLAUSE) GOOD BUNCH OF GUYS.
LET'S FACE IT, LIVING IN A GUN DORM IS NOT ANY MORE LIFE THREATENING THAN SPENDING 160,000 DOLLARS ON
AN ENGLISH DEGREE.
SO COME ON, U OF C STUDENTS, LIVE A LITTLE.
IF NOT VERY LONG.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
