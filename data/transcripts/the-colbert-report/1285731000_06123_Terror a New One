>> Stephen: WELCOME BAN,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, NATION, AS I'M SURE YOU
ALL KNOW, ON OCTOBER 30th, I
AM HOLDING THE MARCH TO KEEP
FEAR ALIVE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
UNLESS, UNLESS THE SUN EXPLODES,
INCINERATING HALF THE EARTH AND
CASTING THE OTHER HALF INTO
ETERNAL NIGHT, WHICH MANY
SCIENTISTS COULD SAY MIGHT
HAPPEN.
NOW, IT'S A RALLY ABOUT FEAR,
AND I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE
PROBABLY TERRIFIED THAT YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BE SCARED OF.
[LAUGHTER]
IS IT THE IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME
HERE AFTER OUR GRANDPARENTS?
IS IT KATY PERRY'S BREASTS?
OR IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR ONLY
SON LOVES "GLEE" SO MUCH AND
DOESN'T SEEM INTERESTED IN KATY
PERRY'S BREASTS?
WELL, I WILL GIVE YOU A COUPLE
OF THINGS TO BE AFRAID OF RIGHT
NOW.
FIRST OF ALL, JON STEWART'S
RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY.
OH, OH, SANITY, I KNOW, LET'S
ALL GO TO LITTLE CAESAR'S AND
GET REGULAR BREAD.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME REMIND YOU...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH, NOBODY WANTS THAT.
NOBODY WANTS THAT.
AND LET ME REMIND YOU OF AN
OLDDY BUT A GOODY -- MUSLIMS.
BUT, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, YOU'RE
SAYING, ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF
PEACE.
NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE BAD.
CERTAINLY WE CAN LIVE SIDE BY
SIDE.
YES.
BUT CAN WE BE DEAD SIDE BY SIDE?
NOT ACCORDING TO THE RESIDENTS
OF SYDNEY, NEW YORK, WHO ARE SO
TERRIFIED OF ISLAM THAT THEY'RE
DEMANDING THAT MUSLIMS DIG UP
THE BODIES OF THEIR RELATIVES IN
A PRIVATE MUSLIM CEMETERY.
AFTER ALL, HOW DARE THOSE
MUSLIMS BUILD A GRAVE SO CLOSE
TO GROUND.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT KEEP IN MIND, KEEP IN MIND,
FOLKS, THEY'RE NOT ASKING THE
LIVE MUSLIMS TO LEAVE, ONLY THE
DEAD ONES.
NOW, USUALLY WHEN YOU DIE YOUR
THREAT LEVEL DECREASES
SIGNIFICANTLY.
BUT EVIDENTLY NOT WITH MUSLIMS.
THEY GET SCARIER.
WHICH CAN ONLY LEAD TO ONE
LOGICAL YET TERRIFYING
CONCLUSION -- MUSLIM VAMPIRES.
[SCREAMING]
AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOT JUST SLEEPER CELLS, SLEEPER
IN COFFIN CELLS.
REMEMBER, A CRUCIFIX WON'T STOP
MUSLIM VAMPIRES.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT LITTLE
STATUES OF JESUS, AND IF YOU TRY
TO SHOW THEM A DRAWING OF
MUHAMMAD, IT JUST MAKES THEM
MADDER.
SO NATION...
[APPLAUSE]
PROTECT YOURSELF.
PROTECT YOURSELF FROM MUSLIM
VAMPIRES BY MAKING YOUR NECK
NON-HALAL.
RUB IT WITH PORK SAUSAGE, OR
BETTER YET, WEAR A BACON
TURTLENECK.
ALSO, ALSO, KEEP A BASEBALL BAT
BY YOUR BED.
NOT FOR THE VAMPIRES, BUT FOR
THE RACCOONS THE BACON WILL
ATTRACT.
NOW, SPEAKING OF MY MARCH TO
KEEP FEAR ALIVE 30BG9th, I
LEARNED SOMETHING FROM PAPA BEAR
BILL O'REILLY THAT IS TRULY
FRIGHTENING.
JIM?
>> ALL RIGHT.
MY DUMBEST THING OF THE WEEK IS
OUR PALS JON STEWART AND STEPHEN
COLBERT.
>> NOW, THERE'S NO ACCIDENT
THAT'S ON THE EVE OF HALLOWEEN,
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN D.C.
AND SEE THOSE GUYS, YOU'LL HAVE
THE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER.
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD.
MY FEAR MARCH IS ON HALLOWEEN
WEEKEND.
I HAD NO IDEA.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, I DIDN'T PICK
THIS DATE.
IT WAS CHOSEN BY A HIGHER POWER.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT HAVING THE MARCH THAT
WEEKEND IS SERENDIPITOUS, AND I
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT WORD
MEANS.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS,
THERE ARE DARK SHADOWY FORCES
OUT THERE THAT DON'T WANT THIS
MARCH TO HAPPEN.
WE KNOW THEY'LL BE TAKING NAMES,
BUT THEY CANNOT INTIMIDATE US IF
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE.
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO COME TO
THE MARCH IN COSTUMES.
DISGUISE.
DISGUISE, YES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DISGUISED AS WHATEVER I'VE
TAUGHT YOU TO FEAR.
MAYBE IT'S A BEAR.
MAYBE... MAYBE IT'S A MUSLIM
VAMPIRE.
OR A LIBERAL MONSTER LIKE AL
FRANKENSTEIN OR A BIAS NEWSMAN
LIKE WEREWOLF BLITZER OR EVEN A
SEXY WITCH.
AND PERHAPS, AND PERHAPS, FOLKS,
THAT NIGHT PEOPLE COULD THROW
FEAR PARTIES OR YOUNG PENAL CAN
GO DOOR-TO-DOOR SCARING THEIR
NEIGHBORS WITH TRICKS UNLESS
THEY'RE PAID OFF WITH SOME KIND
OF SUGARY TREAT, PERHAPS REESES
PEANUT BUTTER CUPS, THE SCARIEST
CANDY OF ALL BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IT'S MADE FROM PIECES OF REESE
WITHSPOON.
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER LATELY.
[LAUGHTER]
