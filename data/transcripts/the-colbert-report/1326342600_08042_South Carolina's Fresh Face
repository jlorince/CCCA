OH, OH, YOU.
HE'S RIGHT.
IF I'M NOT TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH
MITT, I CAN'T COMMIT, BUT WHAT
CHOICE DO I HAVE?
HE WON IN IOWA AND NEW
HAMPSHIRE.
IT'S OVER.
>> GOING INTO SOUTH CAROLINA,
THE BIG QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER
MITT ROMNEY SEW THIS THING UP
WITH THREE BIG WINS IN A ROW.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT SOUTH
CAROLINA.
NO REPUBLICAN HAS EVER BECOME
PRESIDENT WITHOUT WINNING SOUTH
CAROLINA.
>> IT WILL REALLY COME DOWN I
THINK TO SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> ULTIMATELY THIS IS ALL GOING
TO BE ABOUT SOUTH CAROLINA.
WE ALL KNOW THIS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WE ALL KNOW
THAT.
MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IS WHERE PRESIDENTS ARE CHOSEN
AND OCCASIONALLY SECEDED FROM.
BUT, I MEAN, REALLY WHO IS THE
OPTION?
EVERYONE IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD
HAS ALREADY HAD THEIR "I'M NOT
MITT" MOMENT.
I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOME FRESH
FACE, UNTAINTED BY THE PROCESS,
THAT COULD JUST SWOOP IN AND
SAVE THE DAY.
>> A NEW POLL OF LIKELY
REPUBLICAN VOTERS IN THE
UPCOMING SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY
HAVE 5% GOING TO STEPHEN
COLBERT.
>> THE SOUTH CAROLINA NATIVE
COLBERT IS NOT EVEN OFFICIALLY
ON THE BALLOT, BUT HE'S STILL
GETTING 5%.
>> Stephen: OH, MY GOD!
IT'S ME.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
IT ALL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
ANDY TOLD ME TO FOLLOW MY HEART.
AND MY HEART ALWAYS LEADS ME TO
ME.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I AM SO NOT MITT.
LOOK HOW DIFFERENT WE ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M THE ONE WITH THE GLASSES.
BUT WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, THAT'S
CRAZY.
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR
A YEAR NOW.
HOW COULD I EVER COMPETE WITH AN
ESTABLISHED CANDIDATE LIKE
GOVERNOR JON HUNTSMAN?
>> PUBLIC POLICY POLLING DECIDED
TO GO AHEAD AND POLL IT WITH
STEPHEN COLBERT IN THE RACE.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?
>> NO.
>> LOOK AT THIS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> I WAS ON HIS SHOW RECENTLY.
I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR THE
COLBERT BUMP IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>>
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY GOVERNOR
HUNTSMAN, I GUESS THE COLBERT
BUMP REFLECTED OFF OF YOU AND
BOUNCED BACK TO ME.
THAT HAPPENS IN THE RARE
INSTANCES WHEN MY GUESTS ARE
WHITER THAN I AM.
WOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I
JUST... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
SAY.
THIS JUST GOT REAL.
A MAJOR POLLSTER HAS ME AT 5%,
AHEAD OF THE THIRD-PLACE
FINISHER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
I GOT TO ASK: WHAT DO YOU THINK,
NATION?
SHOULD I RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN
SOUTH CAROLINA?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I HEAR WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO
SAY, BUT THAT'S A REALLY BIG
DECISION.
FIRST I NEED TO PRAY ON IT.
OKAY.
GOD'S GOOD WITH IT.
BUT OBVIOUSLY I STILL HAVE TO GO
HOME AND SIT DOWN AND TALK IT
OVER WITH MY MONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
SO PLEASE JOIN ME TOMORROW NIGHT
WHEN I WILL MAKE A MAJOR
ANNOUNCEMENT HERE ON "THE
REPORT."
THERE WILL BE SPECIAL GUESTS AND
HISTORIC DECISIONS, AND IF
YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU JUST
MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
OH, I HAVE TO DO THE REST OF THE
SHOW.
SORRY.
WE'LL SEE YOU
