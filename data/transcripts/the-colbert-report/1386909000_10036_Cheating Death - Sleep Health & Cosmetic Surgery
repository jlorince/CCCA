NATION, GROWING UP, FOLKS, WHENI GOT A COLD THERE WAS NOTHING
MORE COMFORTING THAN A BIG BOWLOF MY GRANDMA'S CHICKEN SOUP.
SHE PUT A TON OF MORPHINE IN IT.
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH
DR. STEPHEN T. COLBERT D.F.A.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YES, SIR, YES, SIR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AS ALWAYS, FOLKS, "CHEATING
DEATH" IS BROUGHT TO YOU BYPRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS.
PRESCOTT.
YOU CAN CHEMICALLY DEPEND ON US.
(LAUGHTER)FIRST UP, SLEEP HEALTH.
FOLKS, A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP ISTHE BEST WAY TO NATURALLY
RESTORE YOU WHICH IS WHY ITTAKES POWERFUL CHEMICALS TO MAKE
IT HAPPEN.
CHEMICALS LIKE AMBIEN.
BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR WE GOTNEWS THAT WAS A REAL EYE
OPENER-- UNLESS YOU'RE ONAMBIEN.
>> NOW A WARNING FOR PEOPLE WHOTAKE AMBIEN.
A GOVERNMENT REPORT OUT THISMORNING REVEALS DANGEROUS SIDE
EFFECTS LIKE HALLUCINATIONS,BEHAVIORAL CHANGES, THINGS LIKE
AGITATION, SLEEP DRIVING, SLEEPWALKING, SLEEP EATING WHERE
YOU'RE IN THIS SORT OF HALFSTATE OF SLEEP BUT YOU'RE ALSO
AWAKE AND FUNCTIONING.
>> Stephen: HEY, THAT'S JUSTWHAT I CALL MULTITASKING.
(LAUGHTER)YOU CAN GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
WHILE STILL DRIVING TO WORKEATING A WHOLE BOX OF BROWNIE
MIX.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FOR PATIENTS OUT THERE WHO
PREFER WAKING UP NOT WANDERINGTHROUGH THE NEXT COUNTY, THERE'S
A NEW ALTERNATIVE.
IT'S CALLED SUVOREXANT, MERCK'SSLEEP DRUG CURRENTLY SEEKING
APPROVAL FROM THE F.D.A. WHICHIS INSPIRED BY RESEARCH ON
NARCOLEPTIC DOGS, WHICH IS ISIMPORTANT WORK BECAUSE NOTHING
HURTS YOUR SELF-ESTEEM LIKE ADOG FALLING ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE
OF HUMPING YOUR LEG.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, FOLKS, SUVOREXANT IS
EFFECTIVE WITHOUT AMBIEN'STROUBLING SIDE EFFECTS BECAUSE
IT HAS EXCITING NEW SIDEEFFECTS.
ONE PATIENT HAD A FEELING AS IFSHOCKED, THEN FELT PARALYZED AND
HEARD VIVID SOUNDS OF PEOPLECOMING UP THE STAIRS WITH A
SENSE OF VIOLENT INTENT ANDANOTHER HAD A FEELING OF SHADOWS
FALLING OVER HIS BODY HUNTED BYENEMIES HEARING EXTREMELY LOUD
SCREAMS.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, OF COURSE, THE EASIEST
THING TO DO WOULD BE JUST LABELTHE BOTTLE "WARNING, MAY CAUSE
SUDDEN ON SET KAFKA."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT INSTEAD, THE F.D.A. TOLD
MERCK TO DROP THE SUGGESTEDDOSAGE DRAMATICALLY FROM 80
MILLIGRAMS TO 10 MILLIGRAMS.
UNFORTUNATELY, AT THAT LEVELPATIENTS RECORDED IT HAD NO
ADVANTAGE OVER A PLACEBO.
WELL, THE FOLKS AT PRESCOTTBELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
NOT BE PUTTING A BUREAUCRATBETWEEN YOU AND YOUR INESCAPABLE
NIGHTMARES.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROUD TOINTRODUCE VAXA-NUFF.
A THREE-POUND BRICK OF PURESLEEP AID.
YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN DOSE BYGRATING OFF AS MUCH AS -- AS
DOCTOR YOU PRESCRIBES.
(LAUGHTER)WHEN YOU FEEL YOURSELF DRIFTING
GENTLY OFF TO SLEEP, YOU'VE HADENOUGH.
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE SOMEONEELSE'S HAND IS DOING THE GRATING
AND YOU'RE NO LONGER YOURSELFBECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRICK OF
VAXA-NUFF BEING GRATEED INTO THEMOUTH OF A STRANGER THAT WAS
ONCE YOU AND THE UNIVERSE FOLDSIN ON ITSELF AND TRANSFORMS INTO
A SWARM OF BABY-FACED VAMPIREBATS, YOU'VE HAD WAY TOO MUCH.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)SO AT WHICH POINT YOU'LL WANT TO
TAKE A LITTLE MORE.
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TOSLEEP FOR WHATEVER YOU DO NEXT.
SIDE EFFECTS OF VAXA-NUFF MAYINCLUDE SLEEP WALTZING, NIGHT
TERRIERS AND NOCTURNALMUNITIONS.
(LAUGHTER)NEXT UP, FOLKS, COSMETIC
SURGERY.
>> UH-HUH!
(LAUGHTER)>>
>> Stephen: FOLKS, I'M A BIGFAN OF COSMETIC SURGERY.
OF COURSE, I DON'T NEED ITMYSELF BECAUSE I HAVE ALL OF
THAT TAKEN CARE OF FOR ME BY THEPAINTING IN MY ATTIC.
(LAUGHTER)STILL, I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR A
NEW WAY TO IMPROVE A PART OF THEBODY I DIDN'T KNOW WAS HIDEOUS.
>> IT'S AN EYE OPENING PROCEDUREBEING DONE HERE IN NEW YORK FOR
THE FIRST TIME.
A WOMAN IS GETTING A PIECE OFPLATINUM JEWELRY PLACED IN HER
EYE.
DR. EMILE CHIN BEGINS THEPROCESS WITH AN INJECTION OF
LIDOCAINE TO NUMBER T AREA.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> NOW I'M GOING TO PUT IN THE
SPECULUM TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.
>> THEN DR. CHIN MAKES A SMALLINCISION WHERE THE JEWELRY WILL
EVENTUALLY BE PLACED.
>> Stephen: NOW, THE PROCEDUREMAY SOUND PAINFUL BUT REMEMBER
BEFORE THEY SLICE YOUR EYE ANDINSERT A PIECE OF METAL THEY
NUMB IT BY JAMMING IN A NEEDLE.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, THIS PATIENT OPTED FOR A
LITTLE HEART.
YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT NEXT TOWHERE HER EYE DIDN'T USED TO BE
BLEEDING.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEPROCEDURE.
>> DR. CHIN SAYS HE BELIEVESIT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SAFE.
>> Stephen: SEE?
IT'S PRETTY SAFE!
(LAUGHTER)THERE ARE SOME RISKS WITH ANY
SURGERY, BUT WHAT'S THEALTERNATIVE-- NOT HAVING METAL
IN YOUR EYE?
OF COURSE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE,THE PROCEDURE HAS NOT BEEN
F.D.A. APPROVED.
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROWAROUND THE PHRASE "NOT F.D.A.
APPROVED" VERY LONG BEFORE THEFOLKS AT PRESCOTT TAKE NOTICE.
FORGET COSTLY PROCEDURES TO PUTJEWELRY IN YOUR EYE.
AT PRESCOTT WE BELIEVE TRUEBEAUTY LIES ON THE INSIDE.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TOINTRODUCE VACSA-BLING, JEWELRY
FOR YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS.

OTHER THING.
(LAUGHTER)SO THIS CHRISTMAS, TREAT
YOURSELF TO DIAMOND PENDANTEARRINGS IN YOUR TESTICLES.
(APPLAUSE)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
