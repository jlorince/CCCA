WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, I GIVE YOU ANSWERS, BUT I
ALSO ASK QUESTIONS ON A NIGHTLY
BASIS.
YOU KNOW, THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS
LIKE, THERE ARE SEA CUCUMBERS,
THERE ARE SEA LION, WHY NO SEA
ELEPHANTS?
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SNORKEL
EQUIPMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENERGY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAISE AND
FOR YOUR LOVE.
FOLKS, I AM DRAGGING ASS TODAY
AFTER PARTYING ALL NIGHT AT MY
BIANNUAL MID-TERM PRIMARY
RESULTS BLOWOUT.
IT IS MY BIGGEST
ELECTION-RELATED CELEBRATION OF
THE SEASON, EVEN CRAZIER THAN
THE BACHANNAL I THROW FOR THE
LATE SPRING CANDIDACY FILING
EXTENSION REQUEST DEADLINE.
I FOUND OUT I COLLECTED 15,000
SIGNATURES... ON MY FACE.
VERY FUNNY, GUYS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THE BIG STORY LAST NIGHT WAS
THE RISING TIDE OF
ANTI-INCUMBENT ANGER THAT FIRED
A WARNING SHOT ACROSS THE FETID
WASHINGTON, D.C., SWAMP LIKE A
NANNY STATE.
THANK YOU PUNDITMETAPHORS.COM.
BUT NO INCUMBENT OUT THERE LAST
NIGHT SUFFERED A MORE DECISIVE
DEFEAT THAN SENATOR JOHN
McCAIN, WHO LAST EVENING WAS
REJECTED BY VOTERS FOR HIS
ANTI-TAX CUT, ANTI-BORDER FENCE
VIEWS.
INSTEAD THEY VOTED FOR A CAN DAY
WHO TOOK THE EXACT OPPOSITE
POSITION OF JOHN McCAIN, DARK
HORSE CANDIDATE JOHN McCAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
HE REALLY... JOHN McCAIN HERE,
THIS GUY, THE GUY ON THE RIGHT,
JOHN McCAIN REALLY TAPPED INTO
THE ANTI-McCAIN SENTIMENT.
IN 2004, JOHN McCAIN SAID, "I
VOTED AGAINST THE BUSH TAX CUTS
BECAUSE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE
AMOUNT THAT WENT TO THE
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS."
BUT THREE WEEKS AGO JOHN
McCAIN SAID...
>> LET'S EXTEND THE TAX CUTS.
LET'S EXTEND THEM.
>> Stephen: AND IN 2007, JOHN
McCAIN SAID, "AMERICA IS STILL
THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY AND WE
ARE NOT GOING TO ERECT BARRIERS
AND FENCES."
BUT IN MAY, JOHN McCAIN
SAID...
>> COMPLETE THE DANG FENCE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW IF IT
WAS NECESSARY TO DROP THE DANG
BOMB, BUT VOTERS CLEARLY LIKED
WHAT THEY HEARD, AND THEY
DECIDED JOHN McCAIN HAS HAD
HIS SHOT.
IT'S TIME TO GIVE JOHN McCAIN
A CHANCE.
SO SENATOR McCAIN, OUR
HEARTEST CONGRATULATIONS AND
