>> WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT, TO ME THERE IS
NOTHING BETTER THAN TAKING THE
FAMILY OUT AND TOSSING AROUND
THE OLD PIG SKIN.
THE SQUEALING SCARES THE KIDS,
BUT IT'S A GOOD WARM-UP FOR
FOOTBALL.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[SCATTING]
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, I LOVE BASEBALL.
THEY HAVE THE MOST LAVISH
SKYBOXES.
WELL, THIS SEASON TWO RECORDS OF
THE GRID DIAMOND MIGHT HAVE TO
FALL THAT HAVE STOOD FOR 100
YEARS.
BOTH HELD BY BROOKLYN CATCHER
BILL BERGEN, WHO PLAYED FROM
1901 TO 1911 WHEN BASEBALL WAS
ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE
OF THE WHALEBONE CORSETS.
BERGEN IS CONSIDERED THE WORST
HITTER IN BASEBALL HISTORY.
HE HOLDS THE RECORD FOR THE
LOWEST SEASON BATTING AVERAGE
AND THE MOST CONSECUTIVE AT-BATS
WITHOUT A HIT.
HE'S SO BAD HE'S BEEN NAMED AN
HONORARY CHICAGO CUB.
BUT...
[APPLAUSE]
BUT, FOLKS, BERGEN'S PLACE IN
THE HISTORY BOOKS IS IN
JEOPARDY.
HIS STREAK OF 46 CONSECUTIVE
HITLESS AT-BATS COULD BE BROKEN
TOMORROW BY THE MILWAUKEE
BREWERS' CRAIG COUNSELL, WHO IS
FOR HIS LAST 45.
HIS TROUBLE MAY BE LINKED TO HIS
NEW BATTING STANCE, WHICH LOOKS
LIKE THIS.
NOW, UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,
HE ACTUALLY STOOD LIKE THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
ACTUAL TRUTH.
WHICH MADE HIM INEFFECTIVE
AGAINST CURVEBALLS BUT DEADLY
AGAINST PINATAS.
MEANWHILE,, OH, HE'S GOING TO
GET THAT CANDY.
MEANWHILE, BERGEN'S ALL-TIME LOW
BATTING AVERAGE OF .139 IS
BECOME CHALLENGES BY ADAM DUNN,
WHO IS CURRENTLY BATTING .166.
I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEONE WITH THAT
MUCH TROUBLE GETTING TO FIRST
BASE SINCE ME.
YOU WILL EVENTUALLY SEE A GIRL
NAKED.
I PROMISE YOU.
JUST WAIT.
NOW, WHAT MAKES THIS AN EVEN
GREATER ACHIEVEMENT IS THAT DUNN
IS THE WHITE SOX DESIGNATED
HITTER.
WHICH IS LIKE MAKING BILLY JOEL
YOUR DESIGNATED DRIVER.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, THERE IS ONE THING... THERE
IS ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME
ABOUT THIS THRILL RACE TO THE
BOTTOM.
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES COULD PLAY
BASEBALL THIS BADLY.
SO I'M CALLING FOR DUNN AND
COUNSUL TO BE TESTED FOR
PERFORMANCE-DIMINISHING DRUGS.
THE HUMAN BODY JUST DOES NOT
NATURALLY SUCK THIS HARD.
WE MUST PROTECT OUR NATIONAL
PASTIME, BECAUSE FOLKS, THERE IS
NOTHING MORE AMERICAN THAN
BASEBALL, EXCEPT GAMBLING ON
BASEBALL.
SO I WAS ESPECIALLY HAPPY TO SEE
THE MLB GET IN ON THE GAMBLING
PART WITH THEIR ONGOING BEAT THE
STREET CONTEST, WHERE FANS
CHOOSE A PLAYER EACH DAY THAT
THEY THINK WILL GET A HIT.
BACK IN JUNE, MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL OFFERED ME A SPECIAL
CHALLENGE.
IF I PICKED MORE WINNERS IN A
ROW THAN THEY DID, I WIN CONTROL
OF MLB'S TWITTER FEED FOR 24
HOURS.
WELL, QUESTIONS WHAT, I WON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NICE.
I... I... I OUTLASTED THE MLB
WITH A MONUMENTAL STREAK OF TWO.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE PLAYERS I PICKED HAD HITS
TWO DAYS IN A ROW.
JEALOUS, CRAIG COUNSELL?
[LAUGHTER]
SO STARTING AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT,
I WILL BE IN CONTROL OF MLB'S
TWITTER FEED AT MLB FOR 24
HOURS.
HERE'S A SAMPLE.
OKAY.
SCORE UPDATE.
SEATTLE SALAMANDERS 7,
ALBUQUERQUE BALLOONS OUGHT.
ALSO IT'S TOSS YOUR TRASH ON THE
FIELD DAY AT ALL STADIUMS.
[APPLAUSE]
AGAIN, THANK YOU, MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL, AND YOU'RE WELCOME.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
