OLD MAN THING DOWN!

[LAUGHTER]
THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE
GREATER JOURNEY:  AMERICANS IN
PARIS."
NOW THIS IS THE 19th CENTURY
AMERICANS GOING TO PARIS.
WHY WOULD THEY GO IN THE 19th
CENTURY?
>> ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE I HAVE
READ ABOUT WERE YOUNG AMERICANS
OF TALENT AMBITIOUS TO EXCEL,
WRITER, PAINTERS, SCULPTORS,
ARCHITECTS AND PHYSICIANS,
DOCTORS.
>> Stephen: WHY GO TO FRANCE?
THAT SEEMS UNPATRIOTIC.
THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED HERE AND
APPRECIATED AMERICAN THINGS LIKE
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND
MAYONNAISE.
CHECKMATE.
CHECKMATE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY WOULD THEY GO THERE?
>> THE STATUE OF LIB BER TIP
HADN'T ARRIVED YET.
-- LIBERTY HADN'T ARRIVED YET.
THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS OF
ARCHITECTURE HERE.
MEDICAL TRAINING IN IN COUNTRY
WAS WOEFULLY BEHIND.
MOST AMERICAN DOCTORS HAD NOT
BEEN TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: NO?
>> AND TRAINED UNDER DOCTORS
THAT NEVER WENT.
>> Stephen: HOW DID IT HELP TO
GOOD TO FRANCE?
THEY WERE TEACHING MEDICINE IN
FRENCH.
>> THAT'S RIGHT THEY HAD TO
LEARN FRENCH TO ATTEND THE
SCHOOL THERE.
>> Stephen: WERE THEY JUST AS
SENATE TOY AS THEY ARE NOW?
THEY ARE CREEPING PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT
FRNS AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE
BEEN IN VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP
FOR OVER 200 YEARS.
THERE HAVE BEEN ROUGH TIME IT'S
BE SURE.
>> Stephen: OH, YEAH.
>> BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE
SUCCEEDED WITH OUR REVOLUTIONARY
WAR OR INDEPENDENCE HAD IT NOT
BEEN FOR THE FINANCIAL HELP AND
MILITARY HELP OF THE FRENCH BOTH
ON LAND AND SEA AT THE SURRENDER
OF CORNWALLIS AT YORKTOWN, FOR
EXAMPLE, THE ARMY UNDER RORCHA
RORCHANMBEAU WAS LARGER THAN THE
ARMY UNDER WASHINGTON.
>> Stephen: I DON'T LIKE.
THAT WE'LLED IT THAT OUT.
WHAT DID WE GET BACK FROM THE
YOUNG THINKERS THAT WENT THERE?
>> WE GOT BACK NUMEROUS
PAINTINGS OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE
WHICH HANG IN THE GALLERIES AND
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND
EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.
WE GOT BACK AN IDEA FOR
SOMETHING CALLED THE TELEGRAPH
WHICH SAMUEL F.B. MORSE CAME
BACK WITH STAOFRPBLGTS WE STOLE
THAT FROM THE FRENCH?
>> HE WAS INSPIRED BUT SOMETHING
HE HAD SEEN IN FRANCE BEFORE THE
TELEDBRF.
HE BROUGHT BACK PHOTOGRAPHY.
HE DIDN'T INVENT IT BUT HE HAD
SEEN IT.
THE FRENCHMAN WHO DEVELOPED
PHOTOGRAPHY --
>> Stephen: I THINK THAT WAS
KODAK.
I THINK IT WAS AN AMERICAN GUY
NAMED KODAK.
>> THEY BROUGHT BACK MEDICAL
PRACTICE AND TRAINING AND
EDUCATION THAT TRANSFORMED
AMERICAN MEDICINE AND THEY
BROUGHT BACK NOVELS THEY WROTE,
ARCHITECTURAL ABILITIES WHICH
ARE REFLECTED IN ALL OF OUR
CITIES.
FROM THEIR TRAINING AT THE ECOLE
THEY BROUGHT BACK STATUES AND
MUSIC AND IT CHANGED US.
AND THEY BROUGHT BACK -- ONE OF
THEM BROUGHT BACK A VERY
IMPORTANT IDEA ABOUT TREATING
AFTERRAN AMERICANS THE SAME WE
TREAT EVERYBODY ELSE.
THAT WAS CHARLES SUMNER.
>> Stephen: IN FRANCE WAS
THERE NO SLAVERY?
>> HE WAS WORKING HOW THE
STUDENT IT'S SORE BOON WERE
TREATED NO -- SORBONNE THAT WERE
AFTER KAREN AMERICAN WERE
TREATED NO DIFFERENTLY.
>> Stephen: BEFORE YOU GO, I
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT EVERYONE
KNOWS YOU ARE THE NARRATOR OF
SEVERAL KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARIES.
>> YES.
>>.
>> Stephen: AND YOU NARRATED
SEABISCUIT, I BELIEVE.
YOU HAVE A LOVELY VOICE THAT IS
CALM AND COMFORTING AND IT HAS
GRAVITAS AND I WAS HOPING TO
HAVE YOU READ A COUPLE THINGS
WITH YOUR VOICE AND GAVE THEM
THE -- GIVE THEM THE KIND OF
GRAVITAS THEY DESERVE.
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN START WITH
THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.
>> MY ANNA KOPBDA DON'T WANT
NONELESS YOU GOT BUNS HUN.
