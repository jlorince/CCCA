NATION, I FEEL SO TORN.
ON THE ONE HAND I'M A FAN OF
AUTHORITARIANS.
ON THE OTHER HAND (WHISPERS)
HE'S A MUSLIM.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK?
HERE TO TELL ME WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO THINK IS THE
PROFESSOR AT THE NATIONAL WAR
COLLEGE, OMER TASPINAR.
PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FROM
THE WAR COLLEGE.
>> THANK YOU.
Stephen: HOME OF THE FIGHTIN'
WARS.
NOW LET'S TALK TURKEY, ALL
RIGHT?
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS DO
THEY HAVE A DEMOCRACY THERE?
>> IT IS IS PROBABLY.
Stephen: PROBABLY?
YOU'RE AN EXPERT.
IT'S PROBABLY.
IT'S LIKE A COIN TOSS ON A
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.
>> THERE'S A DEBATE BECAUSE
HERE'S IS A DEMOCRATIC ELECTED
LEADERS.
ERDOGAN IS DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED.
IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD IT IS AS
DEMOCRATIC AS IT GETS.
>> Stephen: PRIME MINISTER
CENTIPEDE, WHAT IS GOING ON
HERE?
HOW DID HE GET THESE PEOPLE SO
MAD?
IT CAN'T BE JUST OVER A MALL,
RIGHT.
>> THERE IS A BIG SEGMENT OF OF
TURKEY INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED
WITH HIS AUTHORITARIAN
TENDENCIES.
HE CONTROLS BASICALLY
COMMERCIALS.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE A REALLY
GREAT PLACE TO GO HAVE FUN.
>> TELL ME ABOUT IT.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO
TELL YOU?
>> PLEASE.
Stephen: BUT WHY IS... I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY MAKING
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH
TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND LIKE WHERE
THE MALL GOES?
THAT WOULD BE LIKE BARACK OBAMA
SAYING, "WE NEED A LEFT TURN
LANE PAST THE ARBY'S ON MAPLE
STREET."
WHY IS HE MICROMANAGING LIKE
THIS?
>> PARTIALLY BECAUSE HE'S A
CONTROL FREAK.
HE LIKES TO CONTROL THINGS.
HE LIKES TO BASICALLY TELL HIS
CONSERVATIVE BASE THAT HE'S
DOING HIS UPMOST TO HAVE A
CONSERVATIVE AGENDA.
>> WHERE IS HIS POWER BASE?
IF NOT ISTANBUL, WHERE IS IT?
>> THE PROVINCES IN THE HEART
LAND CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS
MASSES URBAN POOR.
>> Stephen: BASICALLY YOU HAVE
THIS CONSERVATIVE, THE PROVINCES
AND THE HARTLAND VERSUS THE
LIBERAL...
>> UPPER CLASS.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE AMERICA
BUT WITH BETTER KEBABS?
>> I COULDN'T SAY IT BETTER.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
HOW DID THIS ULTIMATELY SHAKE
OUT?
LET ME TRANSLATE THAT FOR YOU?
WHEN CAN I STOP CARING ABOUT
TURKEY AGAIN?
>> I THINK IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
WE'LL SEE CONTINUING
POLARIZATION.
IT JUST CALLED ON ITS SUPPORTERS
TO HAVE A BIG RALLY NEXT WEEK IN
ISTANBUL.
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU SEE
ONE MILLION ERDOGAN SUPPORTERS
IN THE STREETS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED.
PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
