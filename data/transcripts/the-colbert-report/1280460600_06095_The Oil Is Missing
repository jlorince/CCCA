FOLKS, B.P.'S OIL STARTED
GUSHING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO
101 DAYS AGO, BACK WHEN THE ONLY
TERRIFYING THING RISING FROM THE
BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN WAS THIS.
>> RELEASE.
>> Stephen: SADLY, RESCUE
WORKERS WERE UNABLE TO SAVE THE
KRAKEN FROM THE OIL SPILL.
TODAY THE TEMPORARY CAP IS
HOLDING, AND CREWS HOPE THAT THE
WELL WILL BE KILLED FOR GOOD BY
NEXT WEEK.
BUT A NEW CRISIS HAS EMERGED.
JIM.
>> FOR 86 DAYS, OIL SPEWED INTO
THE GULF, PERHAPS 200 MILLION
GALLONS OF IT.
SO WHERE IS IT?
TWO WEEKS AGO SKIMMERS PICKED UP
ABOUT 25,000 BARRELS OF I'LLY
WATER IN ONE DAY.
LAST THURSDAY THEY PICKED UP A
TOTAL OF JUST 200 BARRELS.
>> WHERE IS ALL THE OIL?
>> Stephen: THE OIL IS
MISSING.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
GOOD THING, OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF
PELICAN, BUT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHERE IT'S HIDING IN THE
ECOSYSTEM.
OLLIE OLLIE OXEN FREE.
>> OIL LEAKED FROM A PIPELINE IN
SOUTHERN MICHIGAN.
>> Stephen: FOUND IT.
YOU SEE, EVIDENTLY THE GULF OIL
BURROWED BACK DOWN INTO THE
EARTH AND TRAVELED NORTH UNTIL
IT BURST OUT OF A PIPELINE IN
THE KALAMAZOO RIVER ON MONDAY.
AND AS SOON AS THEY GOT THAT
CAPPED...
>> IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THIS
MORNING, WORKERS ARE BATTLING A
NEW OIL SPILL.
>> Stephen: SO TO SUM UP, WE
CAPPED THE GULF LEAK AND IT
POPPED UP IN MICHIGAN.
THEN WE CAPPED IT IN MICHIGAN
AND IT POPPED UP IN THE GULF
AGAIN.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM
AFRAID THE OIL HAS ACHIEVED
WHACK-A-MOLE TECHNOLOGY.
THEREFORE, THEREFORE I SAY, I
SAY, WE MUST ARM OUR PETROLEUM
ENGINEERS WITH GIANT FOAM
MALLETS, AND THEY WILL WHACK
THIS NEW LEAK DOWN IN LOUISIANA,
AND IF IT POPS UP AGAIN IN
OREGON, THEY'LL WHACK IT DOWN
UNTIL IT POPS UP IN MAINE AND
THEY'LL JUST KEEP WHACKING UNTIL
IT POPS UP IN A REFINERY.
HOPEFULLY BY THAT TIME WE'LL
HAVE WON ENOUGH PRIZE TICKETSES
TO TRADE
