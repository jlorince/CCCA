>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HEAD
COACH OF NEW YORK JETS.
I COULD GO ALL THE WAY TO THE
INTERVIEW TABLE.
PLEASE WELCOME REX RYAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY COACH, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS YOU -- THANKS FOR COMING.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE NOT ONLY A
MAN OF SPORT YOU ARE A MAN OF
LETTERS.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "PLAY
LIKE YOU MEAN IT:  PASSION,
LAUGHS AND LEADERSHIP IN THE
WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME."
DO SOME PLAYERS PLAY LIKE THEY
DON'T MEAN IT?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN ACTING
EXERCISE.
PLAY LIKE YOU MEAN IT.
DO YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE NO
YOU ARE ON THE FIELD.
YOU'VE GOT THE BALL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> OH, MY GOODNESS I TELL YOU
WHAT IF THEY DON'T PLAY LIKE
THEY MEAN IT, THEY WILL PLAY
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO
PLAYS LIKE THEY MEAN IT AND LIKE
THEY DON'T.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
>> THE GUY GETTING BEAT ALL THE
TIME CAN PLAY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
WE'LL TAKE THE GUY THAT IS
TACKLING AND CATCHING BALLS.
STUFF LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: TACKLING, CATCHING
BALLS.
COACHING IS DIFFICULT.
TACKLE, CATCH, BALL.
GREAT.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU CALL THIS THE WORLD'S MOST
BEAUTIFUL GAME.
I HAVE HEARD FOOTBALL CALLED
AGGRESSIVE, BREATHETAKING,
THRILLING, YOU KNOW, MACHO WHAT
IS BEAUTIFUL --
>> ALL OF THE ABOVE.
ALL THAT STUFF.
>> Stephen: THAT MAKES IT
BEAUTIFUL?
>> SURE IT DOES.
IT TAKES -- IT'S COMPETITIVE.
IT TAKES COURAGE TO PLAY THIS
GAME AND ALL THAT.
>> Stephen: DO YOU EVER LOOK
AT A SUNSET AND GO, I'D LIKE TO
SEE SOMEBODY TACKLE THAT?
LOOK AT A MOUNTAIN OR A SEQUOIA
AND THINK I WANT THAT THINK TO
GET SACKED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: I ASSUME YOU CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THE STRIKE.
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STRIKE.
[LAUGHTER]
AS THE LOCKOUT GOING ON RIGHT
NOW.
ONE DAY LAST FRIDAY THE PLAYERS
WERE ALLOWED TO COME IN DID YOU
TALK TO THEM AS QUICKLY AS YOU
COULD AND SAY FOR GOD'S SAKE
STAY IN SHAPE!
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY THERE
WERE FOUR OR FIVE PLAYERS THAT
CAME IN.
I GOT TO SEE THOSE GUYS.
WE HAD OUR FIRST ROUND DRAFT
PICK COME IN THE BUILDING.
I GOT TO SEE HIM.
>> Stephen: THE DRAFT IS SON
FRIDAY, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WAS THAT DIFFICULT
TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DRAFT
BECAUSE YOU MUST HAVE WANTED TO
WATCH THE ROYAL WEDDING.
>> I GOT TO SEE THAT EARLY.
MY WIFE WATCHED IT AND IT WAS
CRAZY.
I WENT DOWN AND SAID THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU TALK ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT.
>> Stephen: THEY GOT A NICE
RING.
>> YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: SO I ASSUME YOU
CAN'T DO INTO ANY DETAILS ABOUT
THE STRIKE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
LET'S JUST CALL IT THE FLAPJACK.
AND LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S A
GRIDDLE, OKAY THAT THE FLAPJACK
IS ON AND THEN THERE'S THE
FLIPPER THAT WORKS ON THE FIELD
THAT THE GRIDIRON OWNS.
WHEN DO YOU THINK SHOULD WIN THE
FLIPPER OR THE GRIDDLE?
>> Ed: OH, MY GOOD --
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ALWAYS
SAY THIS THE OWNERS WANT THERE
TO BE FOOTBALL.
THE PLAYERS WANT TO PLAY
FOOTBALL AND THE FANS WANT TO
SEE SO I THINK SOMEBODY WILL BE
EATING BREAKFAST SOON.
>> Stephen: I LIKE THAT.
THAT'S NICE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY IN
FOOTBALL PLAYERS GETTING
INJURED, PLAYERS SPEARING EACH
OTHER WITH THEIR HELMETS, DO YOU
ENCOURAGE THAT?
>> OFFICIALLY, NO.
IT'S NOT TRUE WE DON'T.
>> Stephen: I WOULD SAY
UNOFFICIALLY YOU WANT ACTUAL
SPEARS.
THERE'S A --
>> THERE'S A SPORT CALLED
ROLLERBALL I THINK.
>> Stephen: I DO YOU WORRY
THAT THE VIOLENCE OF GAME SENDS
THE MESSAGE TO THE YOUTH THAT
THEY NEED TO BE AS ROUGH AND
TUMBLE AND AS VIOLENT AND
BEAUTIFUL AS NFL PLAYERS.
>> IF THEY ARE PLAYING FOOTBALL
THEY NEED TO BE BECAUSE THAT'S
THE WAY THE GAME SHOULD BE
PLAYED.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHAT IF YOU SHOWED REAL COURAGE.
DO YOU BELIEVE COURAGE IS PART
OF FOOTBALL?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: WHAT IF YOU SHOWED
REAL COURAGE AND SAID OKAY THE
JETS ARE WE GOING TO THE FIRST
TEAM THAT PLAYS TOUCH FOOTBALL.
YOU PLAY US, IT'S TWO-HAND TOUCH
OR FLAG -- OR FLOG -- BUT -- OR
FLAG BUT WE'RE DOING IT TO SEND
AN EXAMPLE FOR THE KIDS.
THAT WOULD TAKE COURAGE, DON'T
YOU THINK?
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE BRAVE TO
SAY THAT.
>> THAT'S FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
>> Stephen: LETTER.
YOU ARE A LEADER, CORRECT --
>> I GUESS.
I DON'T KNOW NOW I'M AFRAID TO
ANSWER.
JUST KIDDING.
>> Stephen: DON'T BE AFRAID TO
ANSWER.
DOES THIS BOOK TEACH SOMETHING
OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LEADER?
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO LEAD MEN
WHO PROBABLY HAVE STRONG
OPINIONS OF THEIR OWN?
>> RIGHT.
I JUST THINK THE BIG THING ABOUT
LEADERSHIP IS NUMBER ONE IT'S
NOT MY ABILITIES IT'S OUR
ABILITIES.
I'M FORTUNATE I'M SURROUNDED BY
A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE.
I'M SET UP TO SUCCEED.
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME TO
FAIL WITH THE KIND OF PEOPLE I'M
SURROUNDED BY EVERY DAY.
>> Stephen: YOUR DAD A FAMOUS
COACH BUDDY RYAN.
YOUR REX RYAN.
IS -- YOU'RE REX RYAN.
IS EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY NAMED
AFTER A DOG?
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.
