( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOLKS, THANK YOU, PLEASE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S GET
RIGHT TO THE BIG NEWS.
MYSTERIOUS LETTERS SENT TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MISSISSIPPI
SENATOR ROGER WICKER.
TESTS INDICATE THESE LETTERS
CONTAIN THE POISON RICIN.
SADLY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PUBLIC
EYE, THIS STUFF HAPPENS.
THAT'S WHY I NEVER OPEN MY OWN
EMAIL.
THIS IS A FAST-MOVING STORY AND
THERE'S STILL A LOT WE DON'T
KNOW.
FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S A SENATOR
ROGER WICKER?
THERE'S ONLY 100 OF THESE FOLKS
AND I NEVER HEARD THAT NAME
BEFORE.
ROGER WICKER DOES NOT SOUND
PLAUSIBLE AS A SENATOR.
SOUNDS MORE LIKE A PATIO
FURNITURE STORE.
NEXT THING YOU'RE TELLING ME
THERE'S A CONGRESSWOMAN JENNIFER
CONVERTIBLE.
SO, THE POINT IS WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS RICIN
SITUATION, BUT IN BOSTON 48
HOURS AFTER THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY
THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR
BREAKTHROUGH IN THE REPORTING OF
ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE DON'T
KNOW.
>> INVESTIGATORS HAVE IDENTIFIED
A SUSPECT.
>> I WAS TOLD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL THAT THIS WAS A
DARK-SKINNED MALE.
>> SUSPECT HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN
THE BOSTON BOMBINGS.
>> THE SUSPECT WAS A
DARK-SKINNED MALE.
>> GETTING SOME CONFLICTING
REPORTS ABOUT AN ARREST.
>> THERE IS NO ARREST.
WE KNEW WE WERE CLOSE.
APPARENTLY NO SUSPECT AT HAND OR
ONE ARRESTED.
THEY MIGHT BE CLOSE OR THEY...
WELL, THEY MIGHT HAVE ARRESTED.
>> RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY
REPORTS.
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS SAYING
WHAT TO WHOM.
>> WE DON'T KNOW.
A DARK-SKINNED MALE.
Stephen: SO, NO ARREST BUT AT
LEAST WE HAVE NOT WASTED ANY
PRECIOUS TIME NOT BEING
SUSPICIOUS OF DARK-SKINNED
