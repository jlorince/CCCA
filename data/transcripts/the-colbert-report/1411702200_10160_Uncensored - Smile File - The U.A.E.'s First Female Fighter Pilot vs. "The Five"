>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
NATION, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IT ISNEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE
THE TRUE HORRORS OF WAR.
SO INSTEAD, LET'S LOOK ON THELIGHTER SIDE OF ARIAL
BOMBARDMENT IN TONIGHT'S SMILEFILE OF DEATH.
♪  ♪HA-HA-HA!
TONIGHT, THE STORY SLAPPING AGRIN ON MY SKULL IS ABOUT OUR
ARAB ALLIES IN THE WAR ONTERROR.
YOU ARE ALL BRAVE MEN, WITH ONEEXCEPTION.
>> WE LEARNED TODAY ONE OF THEPILOTS IN THE OPERATION AGAINST
ISIS IS A WOMAN FROM THE UNITEDARAB EMIRATES.
MAYOR MARIAM AL-MANSOURI FLIESAN F-16.
>> SHE IS THE FIRST FIGHTERPILOT IN THE UNITED ARAB
EMIRATES.
SHE FLIES AN F-16 AND IS AU.A.E. TEAM LEADER.
>> Stephen:  YES, A FEMALEFIGHTER PILOT FLYING
AIRSTRIKES FOR THE U.A.E.
SHE HAS SHATTERED THE GLASSCEILING.
AND THE REST OF THE BUILDING ASWELL.
FOLKS, I'M THRILLED ABOUT THISLADY PILOT-- OR PIL-ETTE--
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A LONGTIMESUPPORTER OF WOMEN'S EQUAL RIGHT
TO FIGHT IN WARS INSTEAD OF ME.
( LAUGHTER )AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
>> HEY ISIS, YOU WERE BOMBED BYA WOMAN.
OH YEAH.
I HOPE THAT HURT EXTRA BAD FROMYOU BECAUSE IN SOME ARAB
COUNTRIES, WOMEN CAN'T EVENDRIVE.
>> Stephen:  YEAH!
THAT'S WHAT I CALL PROGRESS FORWOMEN!
ANY NOTHING, BUT NOTHING, ISGONNA ROLL THAT PROGRESS BACK
>> I HOPE THAT HURTEXTRA BAD FROM YOU BECAUSE IN
SOME ARAB COUNTRIES, WOMEN CAN'TEVEN DRIVE.
>> PROBLEM IS, AFTER SHE BOMBEDIT, SHE COULDN'T PARK IT.
>> I SALUTE HER.
>> WOULD THAT BE CONSIDEREDBOOBS ON THE GROUND, OR NO?
>> OH!
>> Stephen:  WOW!
WOW!
I MEAN, HOW, HOW IGNORANT.
HOW IGNORANT CAN YOU?
BOOBS ON THE GROUND?
THIS MARIAM AL-MANSOURI WOMAN'SA FIGHTER PILOT.
SHOW SOME RESPECT.
IT'S CLEARLY A "PAIR IN THEAIR."
FOLKS, I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUTSOMETHING-- I THINK THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITHREFERRING TO SOMEBODY BY THEIR
NAUGHTY PARTS.
THAT'S WHERE I AGREE WITH THE[BLEEP] ON FOX.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )LIKE THEM, I SALUTE MAYOR
AL-MANSOURI AND HER TOP GUNS.
THOSE SWEATER MISSLES ARE LOCKEDAND LOADED.
SO ISIS, BRACE YOURSELF FORSHOCK AND "AWWW-YEAH."
THERE'S A RACK OVER IRAQ ANDYOU HAVEN'T SEEN WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION LIKE THIS PAIR OFABU DOUBLE DHABIS.
BECAUSE MAJOR AL-MANSOURI ISFIGHTING ISIS AND THEIR
OPPRESSIVE, NARROW-MINDEDVIEW OF WOMEN, WHICH SHOULD
BRING HOPE TO ALL OTHERINTELLIGENT, CAPABLE WOMEN WHO
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT ARESUFFERING HALF WAY AROUND THE
WORLD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
