>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS ONE OF THE
ARCHITECTS OF REAGAN ONLYICS.
I'LL ASK MY QUESTION TO A RICH
PERSON AND LET THEM TRICKLE DOWN
TO HIM.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID STOCKMAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MR. STOCKMAN, SO NICE TO
HAVE YOU ON.
IT'S JUST A THRILL TO MEET YOU
I'M A HUGE FAN.
>> WELL, THANK YOU.
>> YOU KNOW, YOU, IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING, YOU KNEW REAGAN.
>> I CERTAINLY DID.
>> DID YOU HAVE TO WEAR
SUNSCREEN AROUND THE GUY?
DID HE EVER JUST SPLIT LOGS WITH
HIS BARE HANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF
CABINET MEETINGS.
IT IS TRUE HE AND TIP O'NEIL
USED TO RUSSELL OVER
LEGISLATION?
>> NO, BUT THEY USED TO TELL A
LOT OF IRISH JOKES.
WOULD YOU LIKE THE HEAR ONE?
>> SURE.
>> I CAN'T DO IT HERE.
>> Stephen: PERHAPS AFTERWARDS
OVER APOTATO.
THERE'S ONE GUY IN THE WORLD WHO
CAN ANSWER ALL THE ECONOMIC FOAS
WE'RE FACING IS YOU, REAGAN'S
BUDGET DIRECTOR.
FINISH THIS SENTENCE...
>> AMERICA
CAN FIGHT FOR TWO WORDS, SLASH
TAXES FOR ALL, PAY FOR MEDICARE
AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND NOT
RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGES SCWU
BY CUTTING TA...
>> IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I HAVE
SOME SWAMPLAND IN FLORIDA.
>> Stephen: WHY CAN'T WE CUT
TAXES?
>> WE CAN CUT TAXES IF WE
CONTROL THE BUDGET.
WE HAVEN'T CONTROLLED THE
BUDGET.
WE'VE BUILT UP DEBT.
WE'VE NOW MAXED OUT OUR NATIONAL
CREDIT CARD.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE DEBT?
DEBT OR DEFICIT, DOES IT MATTER
WHICH WORD I USE?
>> DEBT IS THE BETTER WORD.
>>
>> Stephen: CHENEY SAID
DEFICITS DON'T MATTER.
>> HE WAS WRONG.
AS YOU KNOW WITH DEBT, ONE, YOU
HAVE TO PAY IT BACK SOME DAY.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE THE PAY
IT BACK IN THE FUTURE.
BUT THIS ISN'T THE FUTURE.
THE FUTURE IS NOW.
>> BUT THE FUTURE IS NOW.
>> Stephen: NO, IT'S NOT, THE
FUTURE IS... IT'S NOT EVEN NOW.
IT'S EVEN FURTHER IN THE FUTURE.
I THOUGHT I'D WAIT FOR IT, BUT
IT'S STILL NOW.
>> IN 1918 WE HAD A TRILLION
DOLLARS WORTH OF NATIONAL DEBT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DEFICITS.
WE'LL PAY IT OFF IN THE FUTURE.
NOW WE'VE GOT $14 TRILLION WORTH
OF DEBT AND IT'S BECOMING A HUGE
BURDEN ON THE ECONOMY.
AND IT'S PUTTING OUR ECONOMY AT
RISK.
WE'RE BURYING OUR CHIN AND
GRANDCHILDREN IN THIS DEBT.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
EXTENDING THE BUSH TAX CUTS.
YOU DON THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT?
>> NO.
>> BUT CUTTING TAX RAISES
REVENUE.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
ECONOMICS, BUT IT'S CALLED THE
LAPPER CURVE.
>> IT WOULD BE BETTER CALLED THE
LAUGHER CURVE, LIKE TO LAUGH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.
I AM HIP TO THE THEME.
>> GOOD.
GOOD.
GOOD.
>> Stephen: WHY CAN'T WE CUT?
I MEAN, THIS IS OUR
REPUBLICAN... MY REPUBLICAN
FRIENDS ARE TELLING ME WE JUST
GIVE THE RICH THEIR TAX CUTS AN
REVENUE WILL GO UP.
>> WELL, THAT IS NOT TRUE.
IF WE GIVE THE RICH THEIR TAX
CUTS, ESSENTIALLY IT'S TAKING
UNCLE SAM'S CREDIT CARD, HANDING
IT TO THE TOP 2% TAXPAYERS IN
THE COUNTRY AND SAYING, GO OUT
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME, BUY SOME
MORE STUFF AT TIFFANIES AND
MAYBE HAVE A CARIBBEAN CRUISE ON
OUR CARD WHILE YOU HAVE IT.
>> Stephen: AND THAT
STIMULATES THE ECONOMY.
THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT CREATE
JOBS IN AMERICAMENT
>> IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, WE
SHOULD BORROW $10 TRILLION, GET
IT OVER WORK AND DROP MONEY OUT
OF THE HUNT.
>> BUT TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
THE REAGAN ECONOMICS WAS TRICKLE
DOWN ECONOMICS.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SLAPPING
YOURSELF IN THE FACE.
>> NEW YORK I'M TRYING TO SOBER
UP ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
YOU SAY... PLEASE.
>> NO, I THINK WHAT I'M REALLY
SAYING IS THE COUNTRY HAS TO
SOBER UP.
WE'VE HAD A PARTY LIKE NONE IN
HISTORY FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS,
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BURIED
THEMSELVES IN DEBT.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BURIED ITSELF
IN DEBT.
NOW WE'RE COMING TO THE DAY OF
RECKONING, AND WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO CHANGE OUR WAYS.
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A LOT
OF FUN.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO CUT?
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CUT SPENDING.
>> WE OUGHT TO CUT THE DEFENSE
BUDGET.
IT'S $800 BILLION.
>> Stephen: CUT THE DEFENSE
BUDGET?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: CULT THE DEFENSE
BUDGET?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: LISTEN TO THEM
HAND IN FEAR.
WHY NOT JUST HAND THE KEYS TO AL
QAEDA AND PUT LADY LIBERTY IN A
BURQA AND BAN BAKEON.
IF YOU SHOW WEAKNESS, THAT'S
WHAT YOU DO.
AMERICA'S ENEMIES WILL CLOSE IN
ON US.
WE HAVE AN $800 BILLION DEFENSE
BUDGET AND 99% OF IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE GUYS IN THE
JIHAD.
THE LEADER OF THAT MOVEMENT IS
TAL GUY WHO CARRIES AROUND AN
IRON LUNG.
FOR TEN YEARS WE HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO FIND HIM NOTWITHSTANDING
THIS MASSIVE MILITARY MACHINE WE
HAVE.
SO THE ANSWER IS WE GOT TO GO
ABOUT THIS IN A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT WAY.
>> Stephen: ONLY TWO THINGS
YOU NEED TOO CUT, CUT ROADS IN
STATES I DON'T GO TO AND SOCIAL
SECURITY FOR PEOPLE I'VE NEVER
MET.
>> THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT OF
MONEY IF WE COULD CUT ROADS IN
ALL THE STATES THAT WON'T PERMIT
YOU TO COME.
THAT WOULD BE MOST OF THE
COUNTRY.
SO WE COULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY
THAT WAY.
>> CERTAIN BLUE STATES.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
SIMPSON BOWL STUDY THAT SAYS
WE'RE GOING TO RAISE TAXES HERE
AND CUT SPENDING OVER THERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
PROPOSAL IN
>> WELL, IT'S AN EARNEST
IMPRINT.
THEIR MINDS ARE IN THE RIGHT
PLACE.
THEY'RE TRYING THE CALL
ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE, BUT THEY
DO VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT.
NEXT YEAR, THE YEAR AFTER, THE
YEAR AFTER, THINKING THAT
SOMEHOW WE CAN GET AWAY WITH
CONTINUING TO PRINT ALL THIS
DEBT AND RUN ALL THIS RED INK
AND HOPE THE CHINESE KEEP BUYING
OUR BONDS, AND IF THEY DON'T,
HOPE THE FEDERAL RESERVE CAN
KEEP PRINTING MONEY...
>> Stephen:, WHAT'S THE WORSE
THAT HAPPENS.
SAY EVENTUALLY CHINA COMES FOR
THEIR DEBT.
WE HAVE AN $800 BILLION
MILITARY.
CAN'T WE JUST POINT A GUN AT
THEM AND SAY, YOU AND WHAT ARMY.
>> WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS
THEY'RE GOING TO COME FOR THIS.
>> Stephen: I SEE IT.
>> WE'RE GOING TO END UP GIVING
THEM THIS.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
DID YOU DESTROY A DOLLAR BILL?
THAT IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE, SIR?
>> OKAY.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE TO END
THIS NOW JUST SO I CAN DISTANCE
MYSELF IF FROM YOU.
DAVID STOCKMAN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
FORMER BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR
RONALD REAGAN, DAVID
