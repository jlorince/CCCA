>> Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANT TO
TELL EVERYBODY WE'RE GOING TO
PUT ALL THE INTERVIEW I DID WITH
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE UP ON THE WEB AT
COLBERTNATION.COM.
I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE THAT
TECHNOLOGY.
I THINK WE DO.
IT WON'T BE TONIGHT, TOMORROW
SOMETIME, HOPEFULLY EARLY.
IT'S BEEN 16 MINUTES LONG.
IT WAS QUITE ENJOYABLE.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'LL LEARN
ANYTHING.
I DID.
DID YOU ENJOY IT?
