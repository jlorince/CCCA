>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THAT YOU CAN FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.
PLEASE, LISTEN, FOLKS, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE MAY CALL ME
OLD-FASHIONED, BUT TO ME THE
REAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE
BIG FOUR-- CBS, NBC, ABC, AND
MEBC.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AS TOP NEWS DOG OUT THERE, I
LOOK AFTER THE REST OF THE PACK.
I GIVE HELPFUL ADVICE TO THE
ON-CAMERA TALENT.
NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS, BUT
I'M THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED THAT
SAM DONALDSON REPLACE HIS
EYEBROWS WITH MUSKRATS.
(LAUGHTER)
MAKES HIM SEEM MORE TRUSTWORTHY
THAT WAY.
YOU KNOW, KATIE COURIC JUST LEFT
THE "CBS EVENING NEWS" ANCHOR
CHAIR TO OPEN, I BELIEVE A STORM
DOOR COMPANY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND LAST NIGHT I TUNED IN TO THE

REMEMBER THE FIVE Ws-- WHO,
WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, AND WANG!

(LAUGHTER)
YOU'VE GOT THE REST OF YOUR
CAREER TO COVER THOSE WARS.
THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
(LAUGHTER)
OTHER THAN OUT OF THE PUBLIC'S
CONSCIOUSNESS.
TAKE A PAGE FROM YOUR
ESTABLISHED COLLEAGUES WHO,
UNLIKE YOU, KNOW HOW TO LEAD A
NEWS BROADCAST.
>> GOOD EVENING, THE AGE OF
OVERSHARING HAS CLAIMED ANOTHER
VICTIM.
>> FIRST, CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY
WEINER IMPLODES.
>> LEADING OFF TONIGHT, YOU GOT
IT, IT GETS WORSE, MUCH WORSE.
>> I'M ELIOT SPITZER, WELCOME TO
THE PROGRAM.
(LAUGHTER)
TODAY CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER
HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE.
>> Stephen: FOR THE LOVE OF
GOD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE ONE PERSON, THE ONE PERSON
IN THE WORLD WHO DOESN'T WANT TO
REMIND ANYONE ABOUT POLITICIANS'

WHICH IS WHAT GOT HIM INTO
TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
AND WHY HIS COVERAGE WAS CALLED
"THIS TIME IT WASN'T
