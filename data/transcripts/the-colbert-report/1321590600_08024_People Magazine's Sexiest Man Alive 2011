>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS )
>> Stephen:  THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, ENOUGH.
HERE ORGANIZATION HEROES, ALL.
NATION, YOU KNOW IF YOU WATCH
THIS SHOW THAT I HAVE ALWAYS
RESPECTED "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE.
( LAUGHTER )
AS A RELIABLE NEWS SOURCE.
NEVER FORGET-- THEY WERE THE
ONLY ONES TO BREAK THE STORY OF
RICHARD GERE'S SIN MOP--
CINNAMON ROLLS.
BUT NOW THE OLD GLOSSY,
MULTICOLORED LADY HAS DONE THE
UNTHINKABLE.
IN THEIR ANNUAL SEXIEST MAN
ALIVE ISSUE, THEY HAVE BESTOWED
THE CROWN ON BRADLEY COOPER.
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M ANGRY, TOO.
( LAUGHTER )
SEXY?
PLEASE!
IS THAT A MAN A HORSE
TAKE A DUMP AT A WIG FACTORY?
( APPLAUSE )
I DON'T GET IT, PEOPLE?
WHY!
WHY DID YOU PICK HIM?
JUST BECAUSE HE CAN SPEAK
FRENCH?
( SPEAKING FRENCH )
OH, BIG DEAL!
ANYBODY CAN DO THAT.
OUI, OUI.
IT'S EASY.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS INTERVIEW
ANSWER RIGHT IN HERE ON THE
LITTLE INTERVIEW PAGE.
WHEN THEY ASK HIM, WHAT MAKES
YOU LAUGH?"
HE SAYS, "OBSERVING LIFE.
LIFE IS VERY COMICAL.
PEOPLE TRIPPING AND FALLING."
SOUNDS LIKE A NICE GUY.
COME TRIP, BRADLEY COOPER
TRIPPEDNANA AND SHE SHEATERRED
HER PELVIS AND HE'S LAUGHING AT
HER, ISN'T SHE SEXY.
FOR THE RECORD, IN CASE YOU'RE
WONDERING, I AM NOT MAD AT
"PEOPLE" MAGAZINE BECAUSE THEY
DID NOT INCLUDE ME IN THIS
YEAR'S ISSUE ALTHOUGH THEY DID
INCLUDE ME IN THE 100 MEN
SEXIEST VIDEO ONLINE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH!
YEAH, PEOPLE.
I GUESS I'M GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE
WEB BUT NOT FOR PRINT.
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE USED A
PICTURE OF ME WHEN I WAS WEARING
THAT LEATHURE REPLICA OF MY
FACE.
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKES, I'M NOT MAD ABOUT THIS.
I'M MAD AT "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE
BECAUSE THEY USED TO HAVE
STANDARDS.
LIKE IN 2005, WHEN THEY NAMED
MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY THE
SEXIEST MAN ALIVE.
HE IS NOWHERE, NOT ON ONE PAGE
OF THIS ISSUE.
ARE YOU SAYING HE IS NO LONGER
SEXY?
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS AD FOR DOLCE
AND GABANA?
HIS TORSO ALONE IS SO SEXY, THAT
IT IS REJECTING HIS SHIRT.
( LAUGHTER )
SEXIEST MAN ALIVE SHOULD BE LIKE
THE SUPREME COURT-- ONCE YOU ARE
PICKED, YOU ARE SEXIEST FOR
LIFE.
LOOK AT NICK NOLTE.
HE WAS 1992'S SEXIEST MAN, AND
LOOK AT HIM NOW.
STILL SEXY.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
READ THE CONSTITUTION, "PEOPLE"
MAGAZINE.
UNTIL SUCH TIME AS
MR. McCONAUGHEY WANTS TO STEP
DOWN, HE IS THE BEEFCAKE IN
CHIEF.
AND YOU ARE NOT TO STAIN YOUR
COVER WITH THIS
