YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF.

MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES, PLEASE
WELCOME KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHOOO, WHOOO!
KAREEM, HOW'S IT GOING.
>> GREAT.
>> Stephen: SALEM MALAKUM MY
BROTHER.
HOW ARE YOU.
>> I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING
RIGHT AWAY.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO CENTRAL
PARK, MAN?
>> Stephen: WE-- I GOT SOME
EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT OUT
THERE LAST WEEKEND.
WE DUG A HUGE TRENCH AND-- I
HAVE NOT TOLD THE MAYOR YET.
YEAH, IT'S STILL LOVELY.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: STILL LOVELY.
NOW LAST TIME YOU WERE ON
THE SHOW WAS ALMOST THREE
YEARS AGO.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THERE
WAS SOME REPORTED NAZI GOLD
IN GERMANY.
AND I ASKED FOR YOUR HELP
GETTING THE NAZI GOLD.
I CAN SEE THAT JIM.
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO
GO TO GERMANY TO GET THIS
GOLD?
>> WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T YOU MEAN NAZI GOLD?
>> Stephen: -- PICK ON THOSE
NAZIS.
SO NOW YOU'RE BACK, NOW
YOU'RE BACK WITH A
DOCUMENTARY ON THE SHOULDERS
OF GIANTS.
HOW DID YOU PAY FOR THIS
MOVIE, KAREEM?
SHOULD IT BE WITH NAZI GOLD?
>> SECRET CONTRIBUTIONS.
>> Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT ON
THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS.
IT IS A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT,
AS YOU SAY, THE GREATEST
BASKETBALL TEAM YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD OF.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHO WERE THEY.
>> THE HARLEM REDS.
THEY PLAYED AT DANCE HALLS
IN HARLEM UP ON 7th AVENUE
AND 1389th STREET.
>> Stephen: THEY PLAYED AT A
DANCE HALL.
>> YES.
IT WASN'T VERY BIG BUT IT
HAD ENOUGH ROOM FOR THEM TO
PLAY BASKETBALL.
THEY WOULD BRING PORTABLE
BASKETS OUT AND PLAY BEFORE
THEY HAD A DANCE.
>> Stephen: THAT IS NOT HOW
I PICTURE A PROFESSIONAL
BASKETBALL.
SWEETEN DORSMENT DEALS,
PRIVATE JETS?
>> NO, NONE OF THAT.
THEY HAD A DEAL WITH THE
OWNER OF THE DANCE HALL TO
CHANGE THEIR NAMES TO THE
RENS BECAUSE THERE WAS THE
RENAISSANCE CASINO AND
BALLROOM.
>> Stephen: THAT IS WHERE
THEY PLAYED WAS THE
RENAISSANCE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WAS THIS DURING
THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE.
>> YES, IT WAS.
>> Stephen: DID THESE GUYS
PLAY JAZZ?
>> DID THESE GUYS BECOME THE
UTAH JAZZ IS WHAT I AM
ASKING?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: .
>> THEY WOULD PLAY THE GAMES
AND THEN A JAZZ BAND WOULD
PLAY AFTER THE GAMES.
SO LIKE WHEN THE GAME WAS
OVER PEOPLE WOULD COME AND
SEE THE GAME.
THEN WHEN THE GAME WAS OVER,
THEY WOULD HAVE CAB CALLOWAY
UNTIL 3 A.M..
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
BASKETBALL AND JAZZ?
IS THERE ANY CROSS-CULTURAL
CROSS-CULTURALLIZATION
THERE?
>> YES, YES, THERE IS.
>> Stephen: REALLY, HOW DOES
JAZZ INFLUENCE BASKETBALL,
INSTEAD OF TRASH TALKING DO
YOU JUST SKAT AS YOU DRIVE
THE LANE.
>> WELL, YOU SKAT WHEN YOU
GET THE BALL.
EVERYBODY GETS A SOLO WHEN
THEY GET THE BALL AND GET A
CHANCE TO SHOOT, THAT'S
THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR A
SOLO.
AND THEN PEOPLE HAVE TO
PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR
THAT, YOU KNOW.
SO PEOPLE HAVE TO REBOUND
AND PLAY DEFENSE SO THAT THE
GUYS THAT SOLO CAN DO THEIR
THING.
>> Stephen: SO YOU, BY THOSE
LIGHTS YOU WERE ONE OF THE
GREATEST JAZZ MUSICIANS OF
ALL TIME.
BECAUSE--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ARE YOU THE 6
TIME MVP, 19 TIME ALL-STAR,
NBA'S ALL TIME LEADING
SCORER, OVER 38,000 POINTS
LIFETIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YOU POINTED OUT,
YOU POINTED OUT SOMETHING
RECENTLY, THERE IS NO STATUE
OF YOU IN FRONT OF THE
LAKERS STADIUM.
BOO!
>> Stephen: HEAR THOSE
PEOPLE.
>> I GUESS I'M A MISSING
PERSON, YOU KNOW?
>> Stephen: THERE IS A
STATUE OF IMAGINE ANYTHING
FRONT OF THE STADIUM.
>> IT BELONGS THERE.
>> Stephen: SURE IT DOES.
BUT YOU BELONG THERE TOO.
>> I THINK SO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WHAT IF WE MADE
THE HEAD ON MAGIC STATUE
DETACHABLE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AND THEN ON
ALTERED DAYS WE SCREWED YOUR
HEAD ON, AND JACKED IT UP
ABOUT A FOOT.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
WOULD GO ACROSS WITH THE
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: DOW FEEL
SLIGHTED IN ANYWAY BY THAT.
>> A LITTLE BIT.
BUT KNOW, I'VE GOTTEN OVER
IT AND WE'VE HAD A LITTLE
BIT OF EXCHANGE WITH LAKER
MANAGEMENT.
THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO
DEAL WITH THE ISSUE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, IS THE
PROBLEM THAT THERE ISN'T
ENOUGH BRONZE IN THE WORLD
TO MAKE A STATUE YOUR SIZE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE A
NICE STATUE, NAZI GOLD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
KAREEM, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR!
THE DOCUMENTARY IS ON THE
SHOULDERS OF GIANTS.
NOW EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE TO
