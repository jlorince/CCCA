WORLD OF TECH.

LOUD MOUTHS HAVE NOWDESTROYED THE REPUTATION OF
MY GOOD FRIEND TECH PIONEERBRENDAN EICH.

THANK YOU, JIM.
AS SOON AS EICH GOT THE JOBA REPORT SURFACED THAT IN
2008 HE DONATED 1,000 TOSUPPORT A CALIFORNIA PROP 8
WHICH OUTLAWED SAME-SEXMARRIAGE.
SO GAY INTERNET ACTIVISTSFOR LGBTHTTP GOT MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE TO SIGN APETITION ASKING EICH TO
RESIGN AND THE DATINGSERVICE OK-CUPID BLOCKED
FIREFOX ON ITS WEB SITELEAVING MANY OF ITS USERS TO
TEXT GOOGLE CHROME, WHAT?

THANKFULLY, MY GOOD FRIENDAT FOX NEWS BLEW THIS STORY
INTO PROPORTION.
>> WE SHOULD ALL BE VERYAFRAID.
>> WHY DOES A GUY HAVE TOLEAVE A DREAM JOB FOR
VOICING HIS OPINION.
>> SO MUCH FOR FREE SPEECH.
>> SOME OF FOR FREE SPEECH.
>> SO.
NOR TOLERANCE.
>> THEY SAY THEY ARETOLERANCE RANT BUT THEY ARE
NOT.
>> THEY SAY TOTALITARIANDISCOURSE AND IT SHOWS A
LEVEL INTOLERANCE THAT ISABSOLUTELY, IT SHOULD BE
UNACCEPTABLE.
>> THIS IS THE IRONY, ISN'TIT.
PEOPLE PUNISHING SOMEONE INTHE NAME OF TOLERANCE.
IT COMES FROM A FASCISTSOCIETY.
IT IS A SHAME THAT IT IS THEGAY COMMUNITY, AT LEAST THE
GAY ESTABLISHMENT THAT ISLEARNING HOW TO GOOSESTEP AT
THIS POINT.
>> YES, THE GAYS AREGOOSESTEPPING.
WE ALL REMEMBER WHEN HITLERCIRCULATED THAT PETITION
ASKING FOR POLAND TO RESIGNAFTER IT PREVENTED HIM FROM
MARRYING EVAN BRAUN.
FOLKS, A MAN HAS JUST LOSTHIS JOB FOR TRYING TO BAN
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
MEANWHILE, THERE ARE ONLY 29STATES LEFT WHERE I CAN
STILL FIRE SOMEONE FOR BEINGGAY.
I MEAN I HAD TO TAKE ALL MYGAY EMPLOYEES ON A BUSINESS
TRIP TO ALABAMA JUST TO CANTHEM.
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I
WILL BE FORCED INTO THECLOSET FOR MY BELIEFS.
EVERY WHERE I GO PEOPLEASSUME I'M OKAY WITH GAY
MARRIAGE BUT I WILL KNOW INMY HEART THAT THAT IS NOT
WHO I AM.
AND NO ONE CAN EVER MAKE MEBELIEVE IT GETS BETTER,
BECAUSE FRANKLY, THINGS AREPRETTY GREAT FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
