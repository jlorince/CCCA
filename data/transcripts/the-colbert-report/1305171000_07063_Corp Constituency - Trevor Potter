THIS!
HERE TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS
IS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION,
GENERAL COUNCIL FOR THE McCAIN
08 CAMPAIGN AND MY PERSONAL
LAWYER TREVOR POTTER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, TREVOR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TREVOR, I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS
LETTER.
LAWYERS ARE SUCH (bleep)
PRESENT COMPANY ACCEPTED, OF
COURSE.
[LAUGHTER]
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE
SAYING IN HERE?
WHAT ARE THEY REALLY SAY
SOMETHING IN.
>> THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT
YOU ARE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE
IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE
BEFORE.
THEY ARE NERVOUS THAT VIE VIACOM
WOULD MAKE AN ILLEGAL CORPORATE
CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR PAC.
>> THEY ARE ALLOWED.
CORPORATIONS CAN GIVE ME MONEY.
WHY WOULDN'T THEY WANT TO GIVE
ME ALL THAT SWEET, SWEET MONEY.
>> THEY SAY THAT IF IT'S COUNTED
AS A CONTRIBUTION THEY WOULD
HAVE TO SHOW IT ON THE REPORT.
THERE MIGHT BE AN COMPLAINT OR
INVESTIGATION ABOUT WHETHER THEY
SHOWED ENOUGH AND THEY WOULD
HAVE TOP TURN OVER INTERNAL
BOOKKEEPING AND POTENTIALLY
REVEAL VIACOM SECRETS.
>> LUKE HOW THEY KEEP SUMNER
REDSTONE ALIVE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT
WOULD MAKE THEM UPSET.
>> THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HOW
YOU WOULD VALUE THE SHOW, THE
AIRTIME, THE PRODUCTION COSTS.
>> THERE ARE NONE.
I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT GETS PAID
AROUND HERE.
THESE PEOPLE ARE INTERNS.
WHY IS IT SO COMPLICATED TO DO
THIS.
THIS IS PAGE AFTER PAGE.
ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS EFFECT
THE 2012 ELECTIONS.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING TO
INSTALL iTUNES.
HOW DO THE GUYS ON THE FOLLOW.
GET AWAY WITH IT?
>> THEY ARE COVERED BY THE
FAMOUS MEDIA SCPENGS.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT?
>> THE MEDIA EXEMPTION SAYS IF
YOU ARE A BROADCAST STATION AND
YOU ARE NOT OWNED BY A CANDIDATE
OR PARTY.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT.
>> YOU ARE REPORTING THE NEWS
YOU ARE EXEMPT, YOU ARE NOT
MAKING A CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CANDIDATES
AND POLITICS.
>> Stephen: YOU COULDN'T TALK
ABOUT MY PAC BUT IF I REPORTED
ON MY PAC OR MADE COMMENTARY ON
MY PAC OR DID ANALYSIS OF IT
THEN IT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER
THE NEWS EXEMPTION.
>> YOU GOT IT.
>> Stephen: SO IF I WORE THIS
HAT THE WHOLE TIME, I'M FREE AND
CLEAR.
WOULD IT HELP IF I TALKED ABOUT
MY PAC IN A TOM BROKAW VOICE
[TOM BROKAW VOICE [THE PAC IS
EFFECTING THE 2012 ELECTION.
SOUND GOOD?
>> SOUNDS GOW>> Stephen: DO I GET THE
THING?
I WANT THE THING EVERYBODY ELSE
HAS?
I WANT THE SHINY CANDY COLORED
MEDIA SKEFPLS.
>> YOU CAN TO THE FEDERAL
ELECTION COMMISSION AND ASKwWih|çóxD FOR
AN ADVISORY OPINION.
>> Stephen: HOW DO I DO THAT?
>> YOUR LAWYERS WOULD DRAFT.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE MY LAWYER.
DO THAT.
>> YOU YOU WOULD ASK ME TO DRAFT
YOU A LETTER.
>> Stephen: TREVOR DRAFT ME A
LETTER.
>> I HAVE DONE THAT.
>> Stephen: THIS IS LIKE ONE
OF THOSE COOKING SHOWS WHERE
THEY HAVE THE CAKE ALREADY
BAKED.
[LAUGHTER]
WE GOT A LETTER ASKING TO GIVE
ME THE MEDIA EXEMPTION AND THEN
I COULD TALK ABOUT MY SUPERPAC
AND DO ANYTHING I WANTED AS LONG
AS I DID IT LIKE NEWS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WE GIVE THIS TO
THEM.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?
UP TO 60 DAYS LEGALLY.
THEY COULD DO IT QUICKER.
>> Stephen: IT'S A LONG TIME.
>> IT IS BUT IT'S A GOVERNMENT
AGENCY.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS IF
THEY SAY NO TO ME.
IF THEY SAY NO, YOU COULD GO
AHEAD WITH YOUR SUPERPAC BUT
YOUR PAC WOULD BE DISCLOSING
VIACOM'S --
>> I WOULD NEED MY RESUME
UPDATED.
WHAT IF THEY SAY YES.
>> YOU ARE FINE.
YOU ARE BULLET PROOF.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: BIN LADEN SHOULD
HAVE APPLIED FOR ONE OF THESE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.
YOU GUYS WANT TO DO IT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU KNOW
WHAT?
YOU CAN ARGUE FOR ME IN FRONT OF
THE FCD -- FEC BUT YOU KNOW WHO
ELSE MIGHT ARGUE TO ME?
MR. LINCOLN.
THAT'S NOT A BRIBE IT'S FREE
SPEECH.
TREVOR POTTER, THANK YOU SO MU
