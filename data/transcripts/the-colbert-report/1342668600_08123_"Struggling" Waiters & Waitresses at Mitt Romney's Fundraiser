(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH TODAY.
145 DEGREES.
(LAUGHTER) FOLLOWED BY APOCALYPTIC LIGHTNING AND HAIL.
(LAUGHTER) IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE OPENED THE GODDAMNED ARK OF THE COVENANT OUT THERE TODAY.
(LAUGHTER) NEWT SURE WHY I HAD TO THROW IN THE G.D. NATION, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
FOR REASONS THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND OUR ELECTIONS HAVE BECOME ALL ABOUT WHO PEOPLE LIKE MORE.
IT'S AS IF DEMOCRACY IS SOME KIND OF POPULARITY CONTEST.
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT MITT ROMNEY HAS GOTTEN THIS REPUTATION AS A GUY WHO CAN'T
IDENTIFY WITH THE COMMON MAN-- NO MATTER HOW HARD HE FIRES THEM.
(LAUGHTER) EVEN REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND TANDOORI AMERICAN JOHN BOEHNER (LAUGHTER)
... HAS BOUGHT THIS LINE OF BULL DOOKIE THAT MITT'S UNLIKABLE
SAYING LAST MONTH "THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PROBABLY AREN'T GOING TO
FALL IN LOVE WITH MITT ROMNEY." HEY!
LOVE'S OVERRATED.
IT CAN BE DISAPPOINTING WHEN I FADES OVER TIME, BUT WITH MITT THERE'S NO MAGIC FRIGHT THE START.
(LAUGHTER) BESIDES THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES OF MITT CONNECTING WITH REGULAR FOLKS.
>> I DRIVE A MUSTANG AND A PICKUP TRUCK.
ANNE DRIVES A COUPLE CADILLACS.
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THESE.
THEY CAME FROM THE 7-ELEVEN.
I'M LEARNING TO SAY Y'ALL, I LIKE GRITZ.
STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO ME.
>> Stephen: YES, STRANGE THINGS.
THANKS TO THE BLUE FERRY HE'S BECOMING A REAL BOY.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, ON MONDAY MITCH ONCE AND FOR ALL DISPELLED HIS IMAGE AS A DETACHED, TONE-DEAF
BODY-SNATCHING POD CREATURE.
IN FRONT OF DONORS IN MISSISSIPPI WHO PAID UP TO $50 TO ATTEND ROMNEY SHOWS JUST HOW
MUCH HE GETS THE PLIGHT OF THE WORKING JOSING ""I KNOW PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM ARE PROBABLY DOING RELATIVELY WELL BUT NOT EVERYONE IN AMERICA IS DOING SO WELL
RIGHT NOW.
THE WAITERS AND WAITRESSS THAT COME IN AND OUT OF THIS ROOM AND OFFER US REFRESHMENTS, THEY'RE
NOT HAVING A GOOD YEAR.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) I'M GUESSING THEIR YEAR FELT WORSE AND WORSE AS THE NIGHT WENT ON.
NATION, THAT IS HOW A CANDIDATE CONNECTS WITH THE AVERAGE PEOPLE!
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING BLUE-COLLAR JOES LIKE MORE THAN HAVING THEY ARE STRUGGLES
POINTED OUT IN FRONT OF A ROOM OF RICH PEOPLE THEY ARE SERVING.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS?
I SHOULD CONNECT TO MY UNDERLING IT IS WAY MITT DOES.
JAKE JAY, GET OUT HERE!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR COMING OUT, GOOD TO SEE YOU MY FRIEND.
(LAUGHTER) NOW JAY... JAY, I JUST WANT TO KNOW, I JUST WANT... I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT I GET WHAT A CRAP PILE YOUR LIFE IS.
>> I'M DOING OKAY.
>> Stephen: SO BRAVE.
(LAUGHTER) COME ON, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU DRESS LIKE YOU DRUM ON BUCKETS FOR A LIVING.
I KNOW HOW HARD IT MUST BE TO GET BY ON WHAT YOU MAKE AS AN INTERN.
I'M THE ONE WHO SIGNS YOUR CHECK FOR ZERO DOLLARS EVERY WEEK AND THEN WRITES IN THE MEMO LINE
"BECAUSE OBAMA."
>> REALLY, I'M FINE.
>> WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE, JAY,
I JUST WANT YOU TO DRINK IN THE SYMPATHY, JIMMY, CAN WE GET A SPOTLIGHT ON JAY, PLEASE?
LOOK AT THAT LOSER.
(LAUGHTER) THAT IS JUST SAD.
CAN I GET AN "AWW" PLEASE?
(AUDIENCE REACTS) DHUFL PIT THE?
LET IT NOURISH YOU.
THIS IS GREAT.
IT FEELS GOOD, ME SYMPATHIZING WITH YOUR UNIMAGINABLE SQUALOR.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE WE'RE EQUALS.
>> REALLY?
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO EAT LUNCH TOGETHER SOMETIMES?
>> Stephen: I'D LOVE THAT BUT I DON'T GIVE YOU LUNCH BREAKS SO...
(LAUGHTER) YOU CAN SEE WHAT KIND OF PINCH I'M IN.
CAN I GET AN "AWW?" (AUDIENCE REACTS) THANK YOU.
>> SO NO LUNCH.
