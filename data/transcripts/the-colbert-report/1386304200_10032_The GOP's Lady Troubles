GOP IS HAVING SOME SERIOUS LADYTROUBLES AND NOT THE KIND OF
LADY TROUBLES THAT CAN BE SOLVEDWITH A QUARANTINE TENT.
ACCORDING TO AN OCTOBERABC,/WASHINGTON POST/FLINTSTONES
CHEWABLES POLL 63 PERCENT OFWOMEN HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I DON'TGET IT, OVER 90 PERCENT OF

>> ACCORDING TO THE POLITICO,JOHN BOEHNER'SED TO AIDES HELD A
SEMINAR TO DISCUSS HOW LAWMAKERSSHOULD TALK TO FEMALE
CONSTITUENTS AND IT ONLY MAKESSENSE THAT ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR
POLITICAL PARTIES WOULD NEEDLESSONS ON HOW TO TALK TO THE
MAJORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE.
AND THE REPUBLICAN SEMINAR --THIS REPUBLICAN SEMINAR HAD SOME
GREAT ADVICE ON CONNECTING WITHTHE LADIES.
>> THE GOP IS TEACHING ITS MALECANDIDATES NOT TO USE PHRASES
LIK TODD AIKEN DID LEGITIMATERAPE, SO THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS
HOW YOU SHOULD TALK TO WOMEN, TOHAVE WOMEN'S FORUM, IN TERMS OF
KIND OF WOMEN'S ISSUES, TALKABOUT YOUR FAMILY, THINGS LIKE
THAT.

>> SO, GOP REPS, FAKE A SEAT,GENTLEMEN AND LET ME GIVE YOU
THE LOWDOWN ON HOW TO SPEAKRESPECTIVELY TO THE BITCHES.
OKAY.

THEY CONGREGATE SO HANG OUT INTHE WOMEN'S BATHROOM.
>> OF COURSE   SHOWMENT APHILADELPHIA VOTER APPROACH YOU,
DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED, THEY CANSENSE FEAR.
ATTEMPT TO BE LARGER THAN YOUARE, RAISE UP YOUR HAND AND POP

THE ISSUES, NOT COME UP WITH ANEASY MNEMONIC DEVICE TO WHAT
THEY CARE ABOUT, PAY EQUALITY,ABORTION RIGHTS, NATIONAL
DEFENSE, INSURANCE, EDUCATIONAND SOCIAL SECURITY ARE --
PANTIES.
