THE CASE THAT'S REALLY GOT MYGAVEL IS "McCUTCHEON V. THE
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION."
SHAUN McCUTCHEON IS CHALLENGINGTHE LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH ARECURRENTLY
$2,600 TO A SINGLE CANDIDATE ANDAN OVERALL LIMIT OF
$123,000 PER ELECTION CYCLE.
FOLKS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEGOVERNMENT SHOULD TELL US HOW
MUCH MONEY THERE CAN BE INPOLITICS ANY MORE THAN THEY
SHOULD TELL US HOW MUCH RATFECES DMB A HOT DOG!
IT'S FINE AS LONG AS THE RATSKEPT KOSHER.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)HERE TO TELL US HOW MUCH RAT
FECES THERE'S GOING TO BE IN OURPOLITICS IS "SLATE" LEGAL EXPERT
AND SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW ATYALE LAW SCHOOL EMILY BAZELON.
EMILY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMINGBACK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, EM.
FIRST OF ALL, IS THE SUPREMECOURT -- ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE
A SESSION?
ARE THEY ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL ORARE THEY FURLOUGHED.
>> THEY SAY THEY'RE ESSENTIAL.
THEY PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE,THEY'RE HEARING ARGUMENTS ALL
WEEK JUST THE WAY THEY'RESCHEDULED.
>> SO THEY TOOK THREE MONTHS OFFAND THEY SHOW UP AND GO "WAIT,
YOU NEED TO PAY US."
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO BE ANESSENTIAL SERVICE.
THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE.
>> Stephen: NOW, THE McCUTCHEONCASE.
GIVE ME NUTS AND BOLTS HERE.
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS NOW?
$2600 PER PERSON AND$123,000.
WHAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND NOTLETTING ME DONATE ALL I WANT?
>> THE LOGIC IS THAT IF YOU HAVELIMITS YOU'LL HAVE LESS
CORRUPTION.
SO IF YOU COULD GIVE $2,600 TOAS MANY FEDERAL CANDIDATES YOU
WANT IN A TWO-YEAR ELECTIONCYCLE THEN SOMEONE COULD BUNDLE
THE GIFTS TOGETHER.
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TOEXERT INFLUENCE.
THEN YOU WOULD BE THE PERSONWITH THE POCKETBOOK WHO REALLY
HAD THE INFLUENCE.
>> Stephen: WAIT.
SO IF I GIVE POLITICIANS A LOTOF MONEY THEY MIGHT DO WHAT I
WANT?
>> YES, AND WE WORRY ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT'SCORRUPTION!
>> EXACTLY.
AND WE WORRY ABOUT THAT HAS THATAS THE PROBLEM OF QUID PRO QUO.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CAMPAIGNFINANCE REFORM.
>> Stephen: I DON'T SPEAKSPANISH.
WHAT IS QUID PRO QUO?
WHOSE SQUID IS THIS?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> IT MEANS GETTING SOMETHINGFOR SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE.
>> Stephen: BUT ALL WE'RE GIVINGIS SPEECH BECAUSE THE SUPREME
COURT RULES THAT MONEY EQUALSSPEECH.
AM I NOT WRONG?
>> WELL, AND THIS CASE, IF THESUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF
SHAUN McCUTCHEON COULD REALLYCONTINUE THAT IDEA OF MONEY
EQUALING SPEECH.
BUT THE PART THAT REALLY MATTERSIS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT HAS
GOOD REASON FOR PUTTING LIMITSON THE MONEY.
AND IN THIS CASE THERE'S APROBLEM OF CORRUPTION WE JUST
TALKED ABOUT AND THERE'S ALSOEQUALITY BECAUSE IF RICH PEOPLE
CAN GIVE ALL THE MONEY THEY WANTTHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
DROWNING OUT EVERYONE ELSE'S.
>> Stephen: WELL, IF MONEYEQUALS SPEECH RICH PEOPLE SPEAK
REALLY WELL AND POOR PEOPLE HAVEA SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.
(LAUGHTER)>> AND WE WORRY ABOUT THAT
PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: WHO IS "WE"?
DO YOU HAVE A MOUSE IN YOURPOCKET?
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL.
I'M WORRIED THAT MY SPEECH WILLBE IMPEDED BECAUSE-- SPOILER
ALERT-- I'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY.
>> AND YOU'VE BEEN GOOD ATRAISING MONEY FOR ELECTIONS BUT
CONGRESS WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLELIKE YOU EXERTING TOO MUCH
INFLUENCE ON THE PROCESS ANDTHEY WORRY ABOUT ALL THE REGULAR
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T RAISE HUNDREDSOF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND
MAKING SURE THEIR VOICES AREALSO HEARD AND THAT THE
CANDIDATES HEAR ABOUT THEIRVIEW.
>> Stephen: WELL, THIS COURT ISSUPER LIBERAL NOW, RIGHT.
>> IT IS NOT.
>> Stephen: THEY JUST APPROVEDOBAMACARE, THUMB'S UP AND THEY
SAID EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GET GAYMARRIED NOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> TRUE.
>> Stephen: TRUE!
THAT'S TRUE!
YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT'S WHATTHEY SAID.
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODYHAS TO GET GAY MARRIED.
>> Stephen: BUT IT'SRECOMMENDED.
>> NO, NO.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)NO, IT IS NOT.
THEY SAID THAT FEDERAL LAW WILLGIVE FEDERAL BENEFITS TO GAY
COUPLES WHO ARE MARRIED INSTATES THAT RECOGNIZE GAY
MARRIAGE.
THEY DID SAY THAT.
BUT IT'S NOT A LIBERAL COURT.
>> Stephen: IT'S BEEN SEVEN ANDA HALF YEARS SINCE A WHITE GUY
WAS APPOINTED.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIBERAL TOYOU?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT HASANYTHING TO DO WITH LIBERAL.
>> Stephen: IT COMMUNITY?
>> NO, IT DOESN'T.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AWHITE GUY.
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE MOSTCONSERVATIVE COURTS WE'VE HAD IN
MODERN HISTORY.
>> WHICH WAY ARE THEY GOING TOSWING?
>> I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THECOURT WILL CUT BACK FURTHER ON
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHERROBERTS AND ALITO-- CHIEF
JUSTICE ROBERTS AND SAMUELALITO-- WILL GO AS FAR AS THE
OTHER THREE CONSERVATIVES WHOHAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY ARE
REALLY, REALLY, NOT INTERESTEDIN LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE.
>> Stephen: CAN I TELL YOUSOMETHING?
EVERYBODY THROUGHOUT SHOULDLISTEN TO THE SLATE POLITICAL
GAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: AND WITHIN OF THETHINGS THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW THAT UNTIL THIS PARTICULARCRISIS PASSES THERE'S A SLATE
ANN THAT YOU CAN LOOK ATEVERYDAY.
I LOVE IT.
IT PUTS ME RIGHT TO SLEEP ATNIGHT.
EMILY BAZELON, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR JOINING ME.
EMILY BAZELON.
SLATE, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
