[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
ABOUT HOW FALSE STATEMENTS ARE
UNDERMINING AMERICA.
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ACHIEVEMENT
FOR A CANNIBAL.
PLEASE WELCOME JAMES STEWART.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JAMES, VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: CALLED "TANGLED
WEB:  HOW FALSE STATEMENTS ARE
UNDERMINING AMERICA FROM MARTHA
STUART TO BERNIE MADOFF."
HOW ARE FALSE STATEMENTS
UNDERMINING AMERICA?
>> WELL --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WAS THAT A
CURVEBALL?
DO WE WANT A -- HOW ABOUT WE
START WITH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM,
THE LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH WOULD
COLLAPSE.
>> Stephen: WHAT SAY TRUE OR
FALSE STATEMENT?รง
>> THERE'S SOME THINGS HARD TO
SELL TELL.
YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE
ISSUES THRMPL ARE MANY OBJECTIVE
FACTS.
>> Stephen: NAME ONE.
>> WERE YOU TRYING TO INSIDER
TRADE.
WERE YOU RUNNING A PONZI SCHEME.
>> Stephen: NO AND NO.
>> DID YOU LEAK THE NAME OF A
COVERT C.I.A. AGENT TO THE
PRESS.
>> Stephen: I DID NOT.
>> SOME PEOPLE DID.
DID YOU TAKE STRIDES.
THERE'S A GOOD ONE FOR YOU.
>> Stephen: YES!
>> AND YOU ARE THE ONE OF THE
FEW PEOPLE WILLING TO ADMIT IT.
>> Stephen: YOU SEEM TO THINK
THAT THERE'S AN OBJECTIVE
TORONTO BLUE JAY THAT WE CAN ALL
AGREE ON.
>> IN MANY CASES THERE IS.
>> Stephen: BUT IN MANY CASE
THERE'S ARE NOT.
>> THESE ARE NOT WHAT I'M
WRAEUTING ABOUT IN THIS BOOK.
>> Stephen: LISTEN TO THE
EXAMPLES YOU GIVE.
MARTHA STUART.
SHE DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT.
SHE WENT TO JAIL.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Stephen: BERNIE MADOFF WENT
TO JAIL AND BARRY BONDS WAS
SENTENCED TO HAVING A HEAD THE
SIZE OF A --
>> THEY ARE ROLE MODELS.
THEY EFFECT BEHAVIOR BY PEOPLE.
PEOPLE SAY LOOK WHAT MARTHA
STUART DID.
IT WASN'T SO BAD.
LOOK AT SCOOTER LIBBY, PRESIDENT
BUSH COMMUTED HIS SENTENCE.
WHY DON'T YOU COMMUTE MINE?
WHY ISN'T OKAY FOR ME TO LIE?
THEY INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR IN
SOCIETY.
WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
IT TRICKLES DOWN TO ALL LEVELS,
NOT ONLY CRIMINAL LYING BUT ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE RELL TESTIFY
SERIOUS.
>> Stephen: I FEEL LIKE THE
BEHAVIOR YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS
GOING ON FOREVER?
>> EVERY PROSECUTOR TOLD ME AND
THERE ARE SCORES OF THEM
INTERVIEWED FOR THE BOOK.
THEY TOLD ME IT'S WORSE IN THEIR
CAREERS.
I COME TO WORK EXPECTING TO BEv:
LIED TO.
THE ONLY QUESTION IS CAN I
PROSECUTE.
PEOPLE THINK EVERYONE IS DOING
IT.
THAT EFFECTS BEHAVIOR.
WE'RE SOCIAL ANIMALS.
JURIES ARE RELUCTANT TO CONVICT
WHEN THEY THINK SOMEONE IS
SINGLED OUT FOR PERJURY.
IT HAS A BROAD CORE ROSIVE
EFFECT.
>> Stephen: IS IT PERJURY IF
YOU LIED WHEN YOU WERE TAKING
THE OATH?
[LAUGHTER]
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND.
>> Stephen: IT'S GOING TO BE
MY OUT.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME PEOPLE
WHO HAVE SPOKEN ARE READING
THIS.
IT'S A HOW-TO BOOK OF HOW THEY
COULD LIE AND NOT MAKE THE
MISTAKES THESE PEOPLE DID.
I WOULD SAY RULE ONE IS STAY AS
CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.
I DON'T ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LIE.
IF YOU ARE LYING TO -- THAT'S
NOT A LIE.
IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.
YOU HAVE TO TO TELL THE TRUTH.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT NEWS
ORGANIZATIONS?
DO THEY LIE MORE THAN THEY USED
TO?
WE KNOW "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS
A RAG.
DO YOU STILL WORK OR YOU USED TO
WORK FROM "THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL".
>> I'M MOVING FROM "THE WALL
STREET JOURNAL" TO THE "NEW YORK
TIMES".
>> Stephen: IT MORE
RESEARCH --
>> PROBABLY WOULDN'T ALLOWED ME
ON THAT FACT.
I'M IN BETWEEN AT THE MOMENT.
MAYBE YOU COULD SAY I COULD
SPEAK CANDIDLY.
>> Stephen: DID YOU FIND
EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
STARTLING HONEST TO YOU IN THIS
RESEARCH?
>> YES, I DID.
>> Stephen: WHO WAS HONEST
THAT YOU DIDN'T EXPECT?
>> THE ASSISTANT TO MARTHA
STUART'S STOCK BROKER HE INITIAL
LY WITHHELD THE TRUTH.
HE MISLED AND HE SAID I CANNOT
TAKE THE OATH AND THEN LIE.
I CANNOT CROSS THE LINE.
HE TOLD THE TORONTO BLUE JAY AT
GREAT PERSONAL COST.
MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW
MUCH COURAGE IT TAKES AND HOW
MUCH SHORT-TERM HARM COMES IN
TELLING TRUTH.
AS I'M SURE THE TRUTH IS
UNWELCOME.
>> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH IT IS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THEY HAVE THEIR DELUSIONS.
THEY CLING TO THE DELUSIONS.
WE HAVE DELUSIONS ABOUT SPORTS
STARS, POLITICIANS, MEDIA, HOME
LIVING GUYS -BLG.
>> Stephen: DO THEY PANTS MAKE
MY ASS LOOK FAT?
[LAUGHTER]
ARE THERE LIES YOU CAN ACCUSE
YOURSELF OF THAT YOU ARE WILLING
TO TELL ME?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I TOLD A BIG LIE IN THE
SECOND GRADE WHEN I CLAIMED HIS
A DOLLAR STOLEN OUT OF MY LUNCH
MONEY WHEN IN FACT I NEVER HAD A
DOLLAR IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
I GOT ALL THE ATTENTION I
WANTED.
THE TEACHER DRAGGED ME TO THE
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.
THEY CALLED MY MOTHER WHO
THOUGHT SHE WAS SITTING HOME AND
DRINKING.
I COLLAPSED IN TEARS AND WAS
SENT HOME ONLY TO RETURN IN
TOTAL HUMILIATION AND HERE I'M
TELLING THIS STORY.
I NEVER FORGOTTEN IT.
HAVE I TOLD LIES SINCE THEN YES,
BUT NOT THAT I'M WILLING TO
SHARE WITH YOU.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
