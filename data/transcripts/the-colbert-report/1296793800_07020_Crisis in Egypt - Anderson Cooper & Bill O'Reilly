>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, BEFORE I GO ANY
FURTHER I WOULD JUST LIKE TO
DEDICATE TONIGHT'S SHOW TO
MY BROTHER ROSCOE.
(LAUGHTER)
I LOVE YOU, ROSCOE-- ROSCOE.
SORRY ABOUT ALL THOSE
TERRIBLE THINGS I'VE SAID
BUT.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW BACK TO THE NEWS, FOLKS,
EGYPT CONTINUES TO BE ROCKED
BY VIOLENT UNREST IN A MAJOR
TEST NOT ONLY OF THE POWER
OF DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO OF THE
AMERICAN ATTENTION SPAN.
(LAUGHTER)
TEN DAYS, REALLY?
I SAY FREE YOURSELVES OR GET
OFF THE POT.
WE GOT A SUPER BOWL COMING.
PRIORITIES.
WELL, YESTERDAY EGYPT'S
NEWLY APPOINTED PRIME
MINISTER AHMED SHAFIQ TOOK
ACTION TO RESOLVE TO CRISIS
BY SAYING QUOTE I OFFER MY
APOLOGY FOR EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
(LAUGHTER)
PROBLEM SOLVED.
SHOW'S OVER, FOLKS.
BACK TO YOUR PERMIT-- PYRAMIDS,
COME ON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND REALLY, FOR A DESPOT
IT'S SUCH AN ELEGANT
SOLUTION.
IF ONLY POL POT HAD SAID I
APOLOGISE FOR KILLING 3
MILLION CAMBODIANS.
(LAUGHTER)
WE CAN GO BACK TO NAMING OUR
KIDS POL POT AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
LOST OPPORTUNITY.
BUT FOR SOME REASON, THE
UNREST CONTINUES, FOLKS.
AND IT HIT TERRIFYING NEW
HEIGHTS WHEN FOR THE SECOND
DAY IN A ROW CNN'S IMMORTAL
NUSSLE OF ANDERSON COOPER
WAS ASSAULTED.
HE TWEETED THE VEHICLE I WAS
IN ATTACKED.
MY WINDOW SMASHED.
ALL OKAY.
AND THAT'S JUST ONE DAY
AFTER COOPER WAS REPEATEDLY
PUNCHED IN THE HEAD BY
PROTESTORS.
NATION, I NEVER THOUGHT I
WOULD SAY THIS, BUT CLEARLY
THE TIME HAS COME FOR
ANDERSON COOPER TO STEP
DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
HIS CRUEL REIN OF MAKING US
SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT OUR ANS
IS OVER.
THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE HAVE
SPOKEN!
YOUR REIGN HAS ENDED.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
REALLY GOOD LOOKING, AND
COOPER, COOPER ISN'T THE
ONLY NEWSMAN UNDER ATTACK
OUT THERE.
PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY HAS
TAKEN SOME HITS RECENTLY
OVER A PHILOSOPHICAL
BREAKTHROUGH I REPORTED ON
THIS MONTH.
JIM?
>> THIS WEEK, BILL DID WHAT
CENTURIES OF PHILOSOPHERS
BEFORE HIM COULD NOT DO.
HE PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF
GOD.
>> TIDE GOES IN, TIDE GOES
OUT, NEVER A
MISCOMMUNICATION.
I SAY LISTEN, SUN GOES UP,
SUN GOES DOWN, TIDE COMES IN,
TIDE COMES OUT.
THERE IS NO
MISCOMMUNICATION.
SUN COMES UP, THE SUN GOES
DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE TIDE COMES IN, THE
TIDE GOES OUT.
IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.
NEVER A MISCOMMUNICATION.
>> BUT SOMEHOW THERE ARE
STILLATIESTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WORSE YET, WORSE YET THE
LEFTIE BLOGO SPHERE HAS
RIDICULED BILL BY POINTING
OUT THE MOON CAUSES TIDES
AND WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR
CENTURIES.
WELL IT'S HUMBLE PIE TIME
PEOPLE WHO TOOK NINTH GRADE
SCIENCE.
(LAUGHTER)
FATHER O'REILLY, TAKE THEM
TO SUNDAY SCHOOL.
>> HOW DID THE MOON GET
THERE.
LOOK, YOU PINHEADS WHO
ATTACK ME FOR THIS, YOU GUYS
ARE JUST DESPERATE.
HOW DID THE MOON GET BE
THERE, HOW DID THE SUN GET
THERE.
HOW DID IT GET THERE?
HOW COME WE HAVE THAT, AND
MARS DOESN'T HAVE IT.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW COME?
WHY NOT?
HOW DID IT GET HERE?
>> BOOM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> TAKE THAT,
GRAVITY-HUGGERS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HUH?
HOW COME WE HAVE THE MOON
AND MARS DOESN'T.
EXCEPT FOR THE TWO THAT IT
HAS.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW DID THE SUN GET THERE?
WHERE DOES IT GO AT NIGHT?
HOW DID THE MOON GET THERE?
WHY DID THE COW JUMP OVER
IT?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
HOW COME I HAVE TWO FAUCETS.
HOT COMES OUT OF ONE, COLD
COMES OUT OF THE OTHER.
NEVER A MISCOMMUNICATION.
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.
YOU CAN'T EXMAIN THAT.
CHEERS MAAS.
IN FACT, IN FACT, WHERE DOES
BILL O'REILLY COME FROM?
HE'S ON MY TV.
HE'S OFF MY TV, THEN HE'S
BACK.
WHERE DID HE COME FROM
SOMETIMES HE'S ON THE RADIO
AND I'M WATCHING WITH HIM ON
THE TiVO AT THE SAME TIME.
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.
WHY DOES MY TiVO THINK I
WANT TO RECORD SWAMP
BLOGGER-- BLOGGERS, NOBODY
KNOWS, NOBODY KNOWS, CAN'T
EXPLAIN THAT.
KIDS, THEY'RE DESPERATE.
AS LONG AS NOBODY KNOWS, THE
ANSWER HAS GOT TO BE GOD.
QED, PDQ.
LOOK, ALL BILL IS SAYING IS
THAT GOD IS THE ANSWER TO
EVERYTHING.
AND WHERE DOES GOD COME
FROM?
THAT'S EASY.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT CAN'T BE ANSWERED WITH
GOD.
I MEAN HOW CAN HE MAKE
HIMSELF IF HE WASN'T THERE
YET TO MAKE HIM.
THEREFORE THERE IS NO GOD
AND EVERYTHING IS JUST A
CHAOTIC COLLECTION OF RANDOM
ENERGY WITH NO MEANING.
I LOVE YOU, BILL O'REILLY.
NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO!
JIMMY, QUICK.
>> THE TIDE GOES BE IN, THE
TIDE GOES OUT IT ALWAYS
HAPPENS, NEVER A
MISCOMMUNICATION.
>> THANK YOU, BILL.
FOR GIVING MY LIFE MEANING.
YOU'RE LIKE ST. THOMAS
AQUINAS IN THAT YOUR
