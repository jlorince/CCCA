THE NEW MAJORITY," PAT BUCHANAN.
PAT, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON "THEREPORT"!
>> THANK YOU!
(APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: PAT, YOU KNEW
RICHARD NIXON.
YOU WERE ONE OF HISSPEECHWRITERS.
PEOPLE SEE HIM AS A TRAGICFIGURE IN MANY WAYS.
>> RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: WHO WAS THE NIXONYOU KNEW?
WAS HE A TRAGIC FIGURE?
>> YEAH, HE WAS, IN A WAY.
NIXON HAD SOME FLAWS, AND WHENTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES' FLAWS ARE MAGNIFIED ASIN MANY CASES, IT'S A TRAGEDY,
AND HE WAS INDECISIVE INWATERGATE, TOO LOYAL TO HIS
FRIENDS, AND HE DIDN'T ACT ANDIF HE DID, HE WOULD HAVE GONE
DOWN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST PRESIDENTS.
ARMS CONTROL, OPENED UP CHINA,SAVED ISRAEL IN THE WAR, BROUGHT
TROOPS HOME FROM VIETNAM,BROUGHT P.O.W.'S HOME, AN
EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS BUTWATERGATE ERASED IT ALL.
>> 40 YEARS AGO TODAY THESMOKING GUN TAPE WAS RELEASED.
>> I WAS AT CAMP DAVID AND WEFOUND IT.
>> STEPHEN: TELL THE PEOPLEWHAT THE SMOKING GUN WAS.
>> THE SMOKING GUN TAPE WASFROM JUNE 3, 1972 WHERE
RICHARD NIXON WAS TALKINGBASICALLY ABOUT
CONTAINING THE INVESTIGATION OFWATERGATE.
IT WAS A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER ITAND NIXON HAD SEEN THE TAPES AND
SAID HE HAD NOT TALKED, HADBASICALLY NOT BEEN DISCUSSING
THE SO-CALLED COVERUP THEN.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN WE FOUNDIT AT CAMP DAVID WE RELEASED IT
THE NEXT DAY AND DROPPED THEBOTTOM OUT OF --
>> STEPHEN: THE TAPE SAID HEKNEW THERE WAS A COVERUP AND HE
WAS ENCOURAGING THE COVERUP?
>> THE TAPE SAID THERE WAS ACOVERUP AND HE KNEW ABOUT IT.
THE PROBLEM WAS HE HAD NOTSPOKEN THE TRUTH.
>> STEPHEN: SHOULD HEHAVE DESTROYED THE TAPES?
>> HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE MADE THETAPES.
>> STEPHEN: BUT THAT'SDIFFERENT.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING, OKAY, SHOULDYOU HAVE DESTROYED THE MURDER
WEAPON?
WELL, BETTER NOT TO MURDERSOMEONE.
(LAUGHTER)DID YOU ADVISE HIM TO DESTROY
THE TAPES?
>> YES, I DID.
>> STEPHEN: I AGREE WITH YOU.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO OBSTRUCTJUSTICE, GO ALL THE WAY
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> NO, NO!
HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE DEAD WRONG.
HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
WHEN THE TAPES WERE REVEALED,NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD BEEN
SUBPOENAED.
THEY WERE NOT EVIDENCE OFANYTHING.
HE HAD TAKEN TAPES OFINDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NOT KNOWN
IT, THE TAPES OPERATEDAUTOMATICALLY AND WHAT HE SHOULD
HAVE DONE IS KEPT THE TAPES OFBREZHNEV AND THE FOREIGN POLICY
AND JOHN DEAN AND TAKE THE RESTAND GET RID OF THEM.
>> STEPHEN: BECAUSE THEY HADEVIDENCE OF HIS OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.
>> AFTER BURNING HIM HE COULDHAVE SAID GO AHEAD AND IMPEACH
AND BE DAMNED.
>> STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T HESTICK OUT THE IMPEACHMENT.
HE'S MY PRESIDENT.
I WAS A KID WHEN HE RESIGNED ANDI ALWAYS FELT HE WAS MY
PRESIDENT.
>> HE DIDN'T STICK IT OUTBECAUSE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE VOTED TO IMPEACH.
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES INTHE HOUSE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SENT TO THE SENATE AND THENWOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AFTER
FIVE OR SIX MONTHS.
THOSE AT CAMP DAVID SAID WECANNOT PUT THE COUNTRY THROUGH
THIS WHEN WE KNOW THE END IS NOTIN DOUBT.
BARRY GOLDWATER AND OTHERS CAMEDOWN, BUT RICHARD ALREADY SAID
DON'T PUT THE COUNTRY THROUGHIT, END IT AND PUT GERALD FORD
IN OFFICE, WHICH WAS THE RIGHTTHING TO DO.
>> STEPHEN: THERE'S AN IMAGEOF NIXON AS A PARANOID, UNHAPPY
PERSON.
WHAT WAS HAPPY NIXON LIKE?
WHAT MADE HIM HAPPY?
>> I'LL TELL YOU A STORY.
I WAS 14 YEARS OLD WHEN I METHIM.
HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES.
I WAS ON THE CADDY BENCH OF THEBURNING TREE COUNTRY CLUB, ALL
MEN'S CLUB, EISENHOWER GOLFTHERE.
HE CAME OUT THERE AND WAS WITHTHE GUYS OUT THERE ON THE GOLF
COURSE AND HE WAS IN HIS MADE40S.
HE WAS A GENUINELY HAPPY MAN.
HE LOVED THE BATTLE, THEPOLITICAL BATTLE.
WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR HIM UPTHERE AT HIS LAW FIRM, HE CALLED
ME IN AND WE TALKED FOR HOURSEVERY DAY AND HE SAID IF I HAD
TO PRACTICE LAW FOR A LIVING, IWOULD BE MENTALLY DEAD IN TWO
YEARS AND PHYSICALLY IN FOUR.
WHAT HE LOVED WAS THE BATTLE,BRINGING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
BACK FROM THAT HORRENDOUS DEFEATIN '64, HIS OWN RUINED CAREER
AND MARCHING UP THE HILL TOWHERE HE WON THE PRESIDENCY WITH
THE GREATEST LANDSLIDE INAMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT"THE GREATEST COMEBACK" THIS IS
BETWEEN '62 AND '68 WHEN HE'S INTHE WILDERNESS FROM CALIFORNIA
AND BECOMES THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES, NOT ONLY DID HE
REHABILITATE HIMSELF AFTERWATERGATE BUT HE REHABILITATED
HIMSELF BEFORE HE BECAMEPRESIDENT.
THIS MAN RESURRECTED HIS CAREERTWICE.
EVEN JESUS ONLY DID ITONCE.
>> THREE TIMES. YOU MENTIONEDTHE CHECKERS SPEECH
>> STEPHEN: SO HE'S THE FATHER,SON AND THE HOLY GHOST!
(APPLAUSE)PAT BUCHANAN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH. "THE GREATEST COMEBACK "
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
