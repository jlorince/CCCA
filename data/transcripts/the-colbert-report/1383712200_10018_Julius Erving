THE BIG GUYS, AND I WOULD SEETHEM DUNK THE BALL.

IMAGINED MYSELF DOING THAT.

DO IT JUST LIKE THEY DID IT.
I WANTED TO DO IT MY OWN WAY.
AND -->> Stephen:  WITH A LITTLE
STYLE.

INNOVATION.
>> Stephen:  WHAT IS THATLIKE?
WHAT WILL PEOPLE-- WHAT WAS--WHEN YOU WOULD TAKE OFF FROM THE
FOUL LINE AND JUST-- JUST SAILLIKE AN ANGEL THROUGH THE AIR
AND COME THUNDERING DOWN INVEFNLENCE UPON WHY YOU WERE
ENEMIES BY PUTTING THE BALLRIGHT THROUGH THE HOOP AND SWEAT
SPRAYING OFF YOU LIKE A FOG OFTESTOSTERONE THAT WOULD SUCK THE
LADIES OUT OF STANDS INTO THEBACK SEAT OF YOUR LIMO, WHAT WAS
THAT FEELING?
WHAT WAS THAT SPHEELG LIKE?

SO WHEN I GOT BIG ENOUGH AND BADENOUGH TO PLAY UPTOWN WITH THE
BIG BOYS, THEY'D BE SIT OOGHTEDGE OF THE-- ON THE EDGE OF THE
PLAYGROUND WITH THEIR FEAT ONTHE COURT, AND YOU'D COME DOWN
AND MAKE A MOVE AND GO TO THEHOOP, AND YOU'D GO RUNNING BACK
DOWN THE COURT, IT'S LIKE, "YOUCAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
YOU CAN JUMP FROM FARTHER OUTTHAN THAT."
CHALLENGING YOU IN A SPECIALWAY.
AND SOMETIMES I'D BE GULLIBLEENOUGH TO GO FOR IT.
I COULD PROBABLY JUMP FROM ALITTLE FARTHER OUT, EIGHT FEET
OUR, 10 FEET OUT, 12 FEET OUT.
THE FOUL LINE WAS 15 FEET OUT.
SO THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE TO BEABLE TO JUMP FROM THE FOUL LINE.
THAT'S HOW I HONED THAT SKILL.
I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE PEOPLESITTING ON THE SIDELINES IN HARL
WOMEN THEIR FEET ON THE COURTBECAUSE THEY SAID, "WE THINK YOU
CAN DO IT."
AND I DID.
