(LAUGHTER)
NATION--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, THAT HORN YOU JUST
HEARD MARKS THE END OF THE
SHOW'S FIRST QUARTER.
AND HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS.
ALL OF IT.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, BASEBALL.
THE WORLD SERIES CONTINUES.
YES, I AM BEING TOLD THAT'S
TRUE.
GREAT.
BEST OF LUCK TO THE TEXAS
COWBOYS AND THE ST. LOUIS
ARCHIES.
NEXT UP, FOOTBALL.
WHERE AMERICA'S GLADIATORS
BATTLE WEEK AFTER WEEK TO
DETERMINE WHO HAS THE LEAST
SNAPABLE FEMUR.
AS A GRIDIRON CONNOISSEUR I
ENJOY THE FINE POINTS OF THE
GAME.
LIKE WHEN PLAYERS GET FINED.
LAST FRIDAY THE NFL SLAPPED
STEELERS ALL PRO SAFETY TROY
POLAMALU.
WITH A $10,000 PENALTY FOR
CALLING HIS WIFE ON THE
SIDELINE TO LET HER KNOW HE
WAS OKAY AFTER LEAVING THE
GAME WITH CONCUSSION-LIKE
SYMPTOMS.
APPARENTLY HE WAS SO WOOZY
ON THE SIDELINES THAT BEN
ROETHLISBERGER TRIED TO HAVE
SEX WITH HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS-- TRUE STORY.
TRUE STORY.
FOLKS, THE NFL'S BEING
CALLED UNSYMPATHETIC HERE.
BUT I'M ALL FOR THIS FINE.
IT'S FOR THE PLAYERS OWN
GOOD.
WITH POLAMALU SO DISORIENTED,
WHO KNOWS WHO HE MIGHT HAVE
CALLED.
I MEAN WHO AMONG US HASN'T
CONCUSSION DIALED AN
EX-GIRLFRIEND TO TELL THEM
YOU WANT TO GET BACK
TOGETHER RACE KARMA MA
POTATO SALAD.
BESIDES THE LAST THING
PLAYERS NEED IS PLAYERS
TOUCHING BASE WITH THEIR
FAMILIES DURING THE GAME IT
CREATES THE REAL DANGER THAT
THEIR LOVED ONES WILL TALK
SOME SENSE INTO THEM AND SAY
WHY ARE YOU BASHING YOUR
HEAD INTO 300 POUND LINEMAN?
YOUR BRAIN IS A PIECE OF
SPONGE CAKE FLOATING IN A
BONE BUCKET.
STOP NOW WHILE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WEAR A DIAPER.
ANYWAY.
I WISH MR. POLAMALU A SPEEDY
RECOVERY SO CAN GET BACK OUT
THERE AGAINST THE PATRIOTS
THIS WEEKEND AND REALLY SLAM
HIS SKULL INTO TOM BRADY'S
MODEL-SHAGGING ASS.
NEXT UP, BASKETBALL.
FOLKS, IT'S WEEK 18 OF THE
NBA LOCKOUT.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
AND I AM FED UP.
BECAUSE I FOR ONE LOVE
WATCHING A BALD GUY RACK THE
NUT TO THE HOOP HOLE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE PLAYERS AND THE OWNERS
REMAIN MILE AS PART ON HOW
TO DIVIDE THE LEAGUE'S
REVENUE.
TALKS RESUMED YESTERDAY BUT
SADLY NEITHER SIDE WOULD
AGREE TO GIVE THE OTHER ALL
THE MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
TWO WEEKS OF THE SEASON HAVE
ALREADY BEEN CANCELLED AND
AS NBC COMMISSIONER/GREEN
GUTS GOBLIN DAVID STERN AND
THE PLAYERS' UNION DON'T GET
IT TOGETHER SOON THE OWNERS
WILL BE FORCED TO CANCEL
GAMES ON CHRISTMAS DAY.
AN INSULT TO ALL CHRISTIANS.
AND THE MEMORY OF THAT HOLY
NIGHT WHEN GOD THUNDERED ON
TO BABY JESUS THROUGH MARY'S
HALO.
IT'S GOT TO BE THE SANDALS.
NOW COLBERT SUPERPAC ALREADY
WEIGHED IN ON THIS CONFLICT
LAST WEEK WITH A
CONTROVERSIAL AD.
>> IT'S ANOTHER SAD DAY IN
AMERICA AS THE NBA LOCKOUT
GRINDS ON.
DEPRIVING MILLIONS OF THEIR
FAVORITE SPORT.
MEANWHILE, THE NBA PLAYERS
WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET
ALL THE CHEESE.
>> FOLKS THAT FOOTAGE WAS
NOT JUST A METAPHOR.
IF THIS LOCKOUT KEEPS UP,
TNT HAS ALREADY SECURED THE
RIGHTS TO SUNDAY NIGHTS
RATSKET BALL.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE
ACCUSATIONS CIRCULATING ON
SPORTS BLOGS THAT MY FRIEND
DALLAS MAVERICKS OWNER MARK
CUBAN IS FUNDING MY SUPERPAC
TO BE HIS MOUTH BEAST AND
CIRCUMVENT COMMISSIONER
DAVID STERN'S BAG ORDER.
-- GAG ORDER.
AFTER A THOROUGH INTERNAL
INVESTIGATION, I HAVE
DETERMINED THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
THE BIG NEWS IS, LAST WEEK
CUBAN REPORTEDLY MADE A
PROPOSAL HE CALLED THE GAME
CHANGER WHICH WOULD REPLACE
THE SALARY CAP WITH A LUXURY
TAX.
YOU SEE, CUBAN'S CHANGING
THE GAME OF BASKETBALL.
APPARENTLY TO MONOPOLY.
THIS COURAGEOUS PLAN
INSPIRED COLBERT SUPERPAC TO
MAKE OUR SECOND AD ABOUT THE
LOCKOUT.
AND TOMORROW MORNING, WE ARE
DEBUTTING THIS COMMERCIAL,
WHICH WILL RUN IN DALLAS ON
ABC AFFILIATE WFAA DURING
GOOD MORNING, TEXAS, WHICH
IS RUNNING BETWEEN GOOD
MORNING AMERICA, AND
SHOOTING GUNS IN THE AIR
WITH RUSTY.
JIM?
>> THE NBA SEASON IS DYING.
AND COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN
IS DOING NOTHING TO SAVE IT.
BUT MAVERICKS OWNER MARK
CUBAN HAS A GAME-CHANGING
SOLUTION.
>> JUST REPLACE THE SALARY
CAP WITH A PUNITIVE LUXURY
TAX IN LIEU OF THE DOLLAR
FOR DOLLAR FINE BRINGING
BOTH PLAYER CLOSER TO THE
PROCEEDSED PRI.
>> FINALLY A SIMPLE PLAN TO
BRING THE CONTRACTUAL ROCK
TO THE ARBITRATED RIM.
YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS PLAN?
BECAUSE DAVID STERN HAS
PLACED MARK CUBAN UNDER A
GAG ORDER.
WHAT IS STERN HIDING?
STARTING NOW COLBERT
SUPERPAC STANDS BEHIND MARK
CUBAN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT
STAND BEHIND US.
WE MUST SPEAK FOR HIM.
CALL YOUR LOCAL SPORTS RADIO
AND SAY, I AM MARK CUBAN.
>> I AM MARK CUBAN.
>> YO SO, MARK CUBAN.
>> I AM MARK CUBAN.
>> -- RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CONTENT OF THIS ADVERTISING,
MADE POSSIBLE BY A GENEROUS
DONATION OF COLBERT
SUPERPAC.
>> Stephen: YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
NOW WE ARE ALL MARK CUBAN.
THE MAVERICK'S A KUHNA IS
GOING NEED A WAY BIGGER
SKYBOX.
