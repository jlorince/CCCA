LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BIG SHOUTOUT.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO
EVERYBODY WATCHING ALL
AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY
OUR VIEWERS IN NEW ZEALAND.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THERE ANY HOBBITS IN NEED
OF A MASSAGE?
I AM YOUR MAN.
CALL ME.
(APPLAUSE)
GET MY FINGERS IN THOSE
HAIRY TOES.
NATION, I GOT TO TILL, WHEN
WE SHOT BIN LADEN IN THE
FACE, I WAS AS EXCITED AS
THE NEXT GUY.
UNLESS THE NEXT GUY WAS BIN
LADEN.
BUT ENOUGH.
WE GET IT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS AWESOME.
HE'S A GUTSY LEADER WHO
KILLED BIN LADEN.
I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW OBAMA
WHO HUNTS MUSLIM EXTREMISTS.
I LIKED THE OLD BAMA WHO IS
A MUSLIM EXTREMIST.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
I DON'T KNOW, THINGS CHANGE,
I GUESS.
AND FOLKS, I ADMIRE THE
PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE THE
PRESIDENT SEEM LESS AWESOME
BY CRITICIZING HIM FOR NOT
RELEASING THE PHOTOS OR
TAKING TOO MUCH CREDIT, BUT
COME ON, THAT'S LIKE
CRITICIZING SEX FOR RIPPING
DOWN THE SHOWER ROD.
(APPLAUSE)
NOW FOLKS, I WOULD LOVE, I
WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE AT THE TOP OF
THE SHOW BUT THE TV PEOPLE
WON'T LET ME.
>> WE'RE BRINGING YOU
DETAILS ABOUT THE HELICOPTER
USED BY NAVY SEALS IN THE
BIN LADEN RAID.
>> NATIVE AMERICAN LEADERS
ARE CRIT SIZING THE USE OF
THE CODE NAME GERONIMO FOR
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> WE ARE GETTING WORD TODAY
ABOUT THE HEROIC DOGS ROLE
IN BIN LADEN'S TAKEDOWN.
>> THE DEATH-OF-OSAMA BIN
LADEN IS CELEBRATED ON
AMERICAN STREETS AND ON-LINE
AND SOMEHOW MILEY CYRUS
ENDED UP RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT.
>> Stephen: OH MY GOD.
MILEY CYRUS KILLED BIN
LADEN.
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT
WAS COVERT OP, SO PROBABLY
HANNA MONTANA.
OH GOD, SEE HOW THEY SUCK
YOU IN?
I WAS FEELING DESPERATE FOR
SOME OTHER NEWS SO I TURNED
TO THIS THING CALLED THE
INTERNET.
IT'S REALLY COOL.
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE SENDING
YOU FAXES TO A TV ON YOUR
DESK.
SO FOLKS, FRESH FROM THE
INTERWEB I PRESENT THE TALK
TRENDING NONBIN LADEN STORY,
BABY DUCK WATCHING A YO-YO.
LOOK AT HIM.
LOOK AT THOSE BABY DUCKS.
(APPLAUSE)
THEY CANNOT STOPWATCHING IT.
THEY ARE FOCUSED ON IT LIKE
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FOCUSED
ON CATCHING BIN LADEN.
DAMMIT!
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
THAT JUST SNUCK UP ON ME
LIKE A NAVY SEAL TEAM.
STOP IT!
(LAUGHTER)
>> FOLKS, THE ONLY UPSIDE TO
THIS BIN LADEN BINGE IS THAT
IT'S ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH
BAD NEWS TO GET IT OUT THERE
AND GET IT IGNORED.
FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW
THAT IN THE WAKE OF HISTOR I
HAD SEX SCANDAL SENATOR JOHN
ENSIGN GAVE HIS RESIGNATION
SPEECH TO CONGRESS ON MONDAY?
NEITHER DID CONGRESS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BECAUSE NONE OF THEM
SHOWED UP.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY EVEN APOLOGISE.
HE COULD HAVE BANGED ANOTHER
AIDE'S WIFE RIGHT THERE ON
THE PODIUM.
THE MEDIA, THE MEDIA ALSO
DID NOT COVER THE BAYER ASS
PHOTOS OF KATE MIDDLETON'S
PHOTOS THAT SUR FACED ON THE
INTERNET YESTERDAY.
AND THAT SONY PLAYSTATION
REVEALED THAT 25 MILLION
MORE PEOPLE HAD THEIR DATA
HACKED.
WELL, WITH THE NEWS MEDIA
THIS DISTRACTED, I WOULD
LIKE TO GET A FEW THINGS OFF
MY CHEST.
I AM A WEALTHY PERSON.
BUT I STEAL CLIF BARS IF
FROM WHOLE FOODS.
MAKES ME FEEL POWERFUL.
ALSO, I AM A METH ADDICT.
I AM A TWEAKER FREAK.
I AM A SHANK BANGING BAG
CHASER.
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOW MI
HUFFING BUZZER DUST TILL
DAWN.
FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE
THIS TIME TO CONFESS TO THE
1990 VERMEER HEIST AT THE IS
ISABELLA STEWART GARDNER
MUSEUM IN BOSTON.
HERE IS VERMEER'S
MASTERPIECE, THE CONCERT.
VALUED AT $250 MILLION.
I-- I AM KIND OF SICK OF IT.
YOU CAN COME PICK IT UP NOW.
OKAY.
WHOO!
THAT FELT GOOD.
NOT AS GOOD AS DOING A BUMP
OF PRIMO GLASS OUT OF A
