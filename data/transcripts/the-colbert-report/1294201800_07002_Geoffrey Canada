EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ADVOCATE
FOR EDUCATION REFORM.
HOPEFULLY HE'S NOT HERE TO MAKE
ME DO MY 35 UNSERVED HOURS OF
DETENTION.
PLEASE WELCOME GEOFFREY CANADA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, MR. CANADA.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, GEOFF.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, SIR, YOU WERE HERE THREE
YEARS AGO.
>> THREE YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: ON THE SHOW
TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE
CHANGING EDUCATION.
BARACK OBAMA USED YOU FOR THE
MODEL OF HOW HE WANTED TO FIX
EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU'RE THE GUY WAITING FOR
SUPERMAN IN THE MOVIE "WAITING
FOR SUPERMAN."
WHY ISN'T EDUCATION FIXED YET?
>> WELL, LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU
THIS: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS
COUNTRY, WE'RE STARTING TO TAKE
EDUCATION SERIOUSLY.
WE'VE IGNORED THE FAILURE OF
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AS IF THAT'S
OKAY IN AMERICA.
SO PEOPLE HAVE JUST ALLOWED
THESE KIDS TO FAIL FOR 30, 40,
50 YEARS.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
DON'T GUILT TRIP ME.
I'LL BITE.
WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT
CHILDREN?
NO, TELL ME.
TELL ME.
>> THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT HAS
CHANGED.
THERE HAVE BEEN A GROUP OF YOUNG
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE
NOT FIT INTO THE ECONOMY WHEN
THEY COULDN'T GET A HIGH SCHOOL
DIPLOMA.
NOW YOU NEED A COLLEGEDY MOW MA
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THESE
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL.
IF NOT, WE WILL CONTINUE LOCKING
UP CHILDREN IN HUGE NUMBERS.
WE LOCK UP MORE PEOPLE PER
CAPITA THAN ANY PLACE ON THE
FACE OF THIS EARTH.
>> YOU GOT THE HARLEM CHILDREN'S
ZONE.
THIS WAS... THIS IS... YOU
FOLLOW KIDS RIGHT FROM BIRTH,
RIGHT?
>> RIGHT FROM BIRTH.
>> Stephen: WHY DO YOU WAIT SO
LONG.
WHY NOT RIGHT AS ZYGOTES.
SO MANY OF OUR NATION'S FETUSES
ONLY READ AT FIRST TRIMESTER
LEVEL.
>> WELL, WE ARE DETERMINED TO
MAKE SURE OUR KIDS ENTER
KINDERGARTEN ON GRADE.
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
SURE THOSE CHILDREN DON'T FAIL.
WE'VE GOT CONCERN
>> Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVES
THIS IDEA AND IT'S BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL IN HARLEM.
HOW MANY KIDS HAVE YOU HELPED?
>> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER 10,000
KIDS.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE
GRADUATION RATE UP THERE.
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 100% OF
OUR KIDS GRADUATING.
WE'VE GOT OVER 600 KIDS OF OURS
IN COLLEGE.
>> Stephen: BARACK OBAMA SAID,
THIS IS THE MODEL.
THIS WORKS.
WE WANT THE USE THIS.
IS THAT HAPPENING?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT $200
MILLION.
THE CONGRESS IN ITS INFINITE
WISDOM HAS DECIDE THEY WERE
GOING TO CUT THAT BACK.
WE HAVE A CONTINUING RESOLUTION.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY?
>> $10 MILLION.
>> Stephen: $200 MILLION TO
$10 MILLION?
THAT'S DRIVING HARD BARGAIN.
YOU GOING TO LAND IN THE MIDDLE
SOMEPLACE?
>> WE HOPE WE'LL MAKE AN
INVESTMENT.
>> HAVE YOU TRIED GETTING THE
CHILDREN TO PRODUCE WEAPONS,
LIKE MISSILES OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT?
>> PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO
DO IS GET OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NOT
THE USE HANDGUNS.
WE'VE GOT THIS HUGE ISSUE OF
KIDS MURDERING ONE ANOTHER IN
THIS COUNTRY, AND JUST IN THE
LAST DATA WE HAVE AVAILABLE,
OVER 1,500 AFRICAN AMERICAN BOYS
WERE MURDERED IN THIS COUNTRY.
THAT'S MORE THAN ALL THE
SOLDIERS WE'VE LOST IN
AFGHANISTAN.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE NOT ONLY GET KIDS AN
EDUCATION, BUT WE TEACH THEM HOW
TO GROW UP WITHOUT USING
VIOLENCE AND WE CAN STOP THIS
MURDER RATE.
>> WHAT'S THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP?
WHAT IS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP?
>> AS SOON AS WE CAN TEST KIDS,
WE FIND BETWEEN A 25 TO 35-POINT
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHITE KIDS
AND BLACK KIDS IN PATH AND IN
READING.
>> SIR, SIR, THAT SOUNDS RACIST
TO ME?
>> WELL...
>>LY NOT HAVE THAT ON MY SHOW?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
>> WELL, I THINK THIS IS NOT
MATTER OF RACISM.
THIS IS MATTER OF SOME OUR KIDS
GETTING A POOR EDUCATION.
WE HAVE TO HOLD THE ADULT
RESPONSIBLE.
>> HOW SOON DO WE TEST?
>> WE START AT THE THIRD GRADE.
THE GAP SHOWS UP.
>> EARLIER?
>> YOU CAN START TESTING
EARLIER.
THE PROBLEM IS NOT WHEN YOU
START TESTING.
THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE ALLOWED OUR
SCHOOLS TO FAIL THESE KIDS WITH
NO CONSEQUENCES.
THERE'S NO PROBLEM
>> WHO IS TO BLAME?
WHO IS TO BLAME?
IS IT THE TEACHER'S UNION OR THE
TEACHER'S UNION?
>> I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE REALLY
SAY BOTH IN THIS CASE.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE FAIR ABOUT
IT.
YOU'RE FAIR ABOUT IT: FAIR AND
BALANCED.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.
LAST QUESTION.
WAITING FOR SUPERMAN.
WHY WERE YOU WAITING FOR
SUPERMAN?
WHY NOT BATMAN?
BOTH WERE D.C. COMICS.
YOU CAN SEND A LITTLE BAT SIGNAL
UP THERE.
>> WHEN I WAS A KID, I GREW UP
IN PART OF THIS CITY IN THE
SOUTH BRONX THAT WAS A HORRIBLE
PLACE TO GROW UP IN THE 60s.
I BELIEVED IN SUPERHEROES.
IT WOULD TAKE A SUPERHERE ROW IN
MY OPINION TO SAVE US.
MOST OF MY FRIENDS THAT I GREW
UP WITH DIDN'T MAKE IT.
SO THIS IDEA THAT SOME OF US
HAVE TO GO BACK IN THESE
COMMUNITIES AND MAKE A
DIFFERENCE FOR THESE KIDS, THERE
SHOULD BE NO CHILD WAITING FOR
SUPERMAN.
WE SHOULD BE THERE FOR THESE
KIDS RIGHT NOW.
>> OKAY, KIDS, DON'T WAIT FOR
SUPERMAN.
DON'T WAIT FOR SUPERMAN?
AND WHATEVER YOU DORK DON'T WAIT
FOR AQUAMAN.
YOU COULD DROWN.
GEOFFREY CANADA, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
