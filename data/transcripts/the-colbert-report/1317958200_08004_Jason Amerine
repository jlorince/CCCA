>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT
IS AMONG THE FIRST AMERICAN
SOLDIERS TO FIGHT IN
AFGHANISTAN.
I WILL ASK HIM WHERE I CAN
GET ONE OF THOSE KARZAI
HATS.
PLEASE WELCOME LIEUTENANT
COLONEL JASON AMERINE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LIEUTENANT COLONEL, THANKS
SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
>> OF COURSE, THANK YOU FOR
HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: THANK HIM FOR
HIS SERVICE, EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IS IT HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO
SAY WHEN SOMEBODY THANKS YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.
>> IT ALWAYS IS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY YOU'RE
WELCOME.
THAT SEEMS A LITTLE CASUAL.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE MUST SAY
IT A LOT, THOUGH.
>> NOT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD
THINK.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT THAT'S
ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE
WHEN WE, WHEN WE'RE
TRAVELING IN UNIFORM, WHEN
WE'RE VISIBLE TRAVELING IN
AIRPORTS THEN YEAH, PEOPLE
ARE RUNNING UP TO US.
WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE WITH
SHORT HAIR IN CIVILIAN
CLOTHES THAT ARE TRAVELING,
YOU KNOW, AT AIRGAS STATION
GETTING GAS OR WHATEVER,
THEN I THINK WE JUST SEEM A
LITTLE BIT LESS APPROACHABLE
IN A STRANGE WAY, WHEN WE'RE
NOT IN UNIFORM, BUT PEOPLE
KNOW WE'RE IN THE MILITARY.
>> Stephen: SPEAKING OF
UNIFORMS, THANK YOU FOR
COMING IN THE FULL DRESS.
A LOT OF THE SOLDIERS COME
ON IN THIS AWFUL OLIVE DRAB.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU, YOU REALLY PUT ON
THE DUDS.
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS
UP HERE.
ARE THESE HARD TO GET?
THE THINGS-- IS IT DIFFICULT
TO GET THE THINGS THAT YOU
HAVE ON YOUR CHEST.
>> YOU KNOW, FOR ME, THE
STUFF ON MY UNIFORM NEVER
MEANT A WHOLE LOT IT WAS
ACTUALLY THE STUFF MY
SOLDIERS EARNED THAT MEANT
EVERYTHING TO ME.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU AND YOUR SOLDIERS
EARNED.
YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRST
GROUPS TO GO IN TO
AFGHANISTAN.
TEN YEARS AGO, TOMORROW?
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHAT WAS AFGHANISTAN LIKE AT
THE TIME.
>> 2001, I MEAN I THINK
PEOPLE FORGET THE EMOTION.
9/11 HAD JUST HAPPENED.
AND FOR US THERE IS SUCH A
SENSE OF PURPOSE WHEN WE
WENT IN.
WE DIDN'T KNOW THE AFGHANS.
THE AFGHANS DIDN'T KNOW US.
THEY'D SUFFERED THROUGH A
TRAUMATIC CIVIL WAR THAT
THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE
RIGHT WITH THE TALIBAN
REGIME IN POWER.
FOR US, WE WERE TRYING TO
FIND A RECKONING FOR THE
SEPTEMBER 11th ATTACKS.
I MEAN WE'RE ON THE GROUND.
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE
THINGS OUT AS WE WENT ALONG.
>> Stephen: YOU HAD NEVER
TRAINED WITH THESE GUYS
BEFORE, HAVE YOU.
>> NO, WE HAD NEVER BEEN
THERE BEFORE.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE
FIGHTING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH
AFGHANS WHO YOU HAD JUST
MET.
>> YEAH, I MEAN WE HAD TO
TRUST EACH OTHER QUICKLY.
AND THE MOST SUREFIRE WAY TO
GAIN TRUST IS WHEN YOU ARE
GETTING SHOT AT BY THE
ENEMY.
>> Stephen: THAT IS A VERY
KEY TRUST EXERCISE.
OKAY, SO YOU FOUGHT ALONG
HAMID KARZAI.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DID YOU KNOW
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE A
LEADER?
COULD YOU SEE THAT IN HIM?
>> I ACTUALLY, WHEN WE FIRST
MET HIM, HE SEEMED LIKE A
COLLEGE PROFESSOR TO US.
BUT MY FONDEST MEMORY WAS
WE'RE OUT ON THE STREET,
TRYING TO GATHER GUERRILLAS
BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF TALIBAN
ARE COMING TO ATTACK US.
AND KARZAI IS OUT THERE WITH
US BRAVELY GATHERING THE
TROOPS SO WE COULD DO WHAT
WE COULD TO PROTECT
EVERYBODY.
HE WAS BRAVE.
HE WAS FEARLESS.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU LIVING
MONDAY THE AFGHANS, WERE YOU
LIVING WITH THEM.
>> THAT IS WHAT SPECIAL
FORCES DOES.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SORRY, I
FORGOT TO TELL THE PEOPLE
SPECIFICALLY, YOU'RE SPECIAL
FORCES OFFICER.
DID YOU HAVE THE BEARD AND
WERE YOU SORT OF BLENDING IN
THE WHOLE TIME.
>> WE ALL GREW BEARDS, WE
DID.
WE DIDN'T BLEND IN VERY WELL
BECAUSE THE 200 POUND
AMERICANS, WE DIDN'T LOOK
AFGHAN BUT WE AT LEAST
LOOKED LIKE WE WERE TRYING
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: IT'S GOOD, IT'S
GOOD.
NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S GOOD.
HOW LARGE WAS THE GROUP YOU
COMMANDED?
>> I COMMANDED AN 11-MAN
SPECIAL FORCES TEAM.
>> Stephen: AND DID ALL
THOSE MEN MAKE IT BACK.
>> NO.
I LOST TWO OF MY MEN.
THEIR HEART AND SOUL OF THE
TEAM WERE DAN PETITORE AND
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
THEY REASON INCREDIBLE
SOLDIERS.
DAN WAS THE VOICE OF THE
DEEP.
HE WAS ONE THAT KEPT US
SANE.
HE WAS JUST AN AMAZING MAN.
JEFF WAS THE FATHER FIGURE,
MY SECOND IN COMMAND.
AND HE WAS ONE THAT MADE
SURE WE WERE ON THE RIGHT
TRACK.
HE KEPT US BRAVE.
>> Stephen: TEN YEARS ON,
SEEING THE SACRIFICE THOSE
TWO MEN MADE FOR THEIR
COUNTRY AND ALL THE
SACRIFICE THAT THE 1800 MEN
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN
AFGHANISTAN JUST FROM THE
AMERICAN FORCES, NOW WE'VE
GOTTEN BIN LADEN.
THE AL QAEDA HAS BEEN DRIVEN
OUT INTO PAKISTAN, SHOULD WE
STILL BE IN AFGHANISTAN?
ISN'T IT TIME TO SAY WE DID
EVERYTHING THAT WE HAD SET
OUT TO DO.
LET'S COME HOME AND DO SOME
NATION BUILDING HERE?
>> THAT'S CERTAINLY AN
OPTION.
WE DID IT IN THE '80s.
AND I GUESS YOU KNOW, '80s
RETRO CAN APPLY HERE TOO.
IN THE '80s WE FOUGHT WITH
THE AFGHANS, AGAINST THE
SOVIETS.
WHEN THE SOVIETS WERE
DEFEATED AND THEY RETREATED
FROM THE COUNTRY, WE LEFT
AFGHANISTAN RIGHT AWAY AND
THE COUNTRY FELL INTO A
TERRIBLE CIVIL WAR.
THAT'S WHERE THE TALIBAN
CAME FROM.
I MEAN WE HAD THAT OPTION
AGAIN.
IF WE CAN WITHDRAW AND WE
CAN LEAVE IT TO THE AFGHANS.
I MEAN ULTIMATELY THIS IS AN
AFGHAN FIGHT AND IT'S FOR
THE AFGHANS TO FIGURE OUT
THEIR FUTURE.
>> Stephen: AS YOU SAID AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE
INTERVIEW IT IS HARD
SOMETIMES TO HEAR THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.
YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY.
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU
THINK THAT PEOPLE COULD SAY
TO SERVICE MEMBERS TO THANK
THEM?
>> I THINK THANK YOU FOR
YOUR SERVICE IS THE RIGHT
THING TO SAY.
I JUST THINK THAT FOR US
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE
THINK OF THOSE WHO DIED.
WE THINK OF THOSE WHO ARE
STILL OVERSEAS.
WE THINK OF THOSE WHO ARE
RECOVERING FROM HORRIBLE
INJURIES IN THE HOSPITALS.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO
SAY.
>> Stephen: WELL, I WILL
JUST THANK YOU AGAIN, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
SERVICE.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL JASON
