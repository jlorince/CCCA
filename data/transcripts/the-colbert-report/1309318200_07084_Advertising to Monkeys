[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, FOLKS -- I'M NOT TELLING
ANY TALES OUTS OF SCHOOL HERE.
IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR ECONOMY
IS IN THE DUMPSTER BECAUSE OUR
ECONOMY KNOWS THE DUMPSTER IS
WHERE YOU CAN SOMETIMES FIND OLD
MUST HAVE FINS.
CONSUME -- MUFFINS.
CONSUMER SPENDING IS DOWN AND
WE'RE IN DANGER OF A CRIPPLING
DOUBLE DIP RECESSION.
WHICH IS TERRIBLE BECAUSE IF WE
DOUBLE DIP IT WILL HAVE THE
FIRST RECESSIONS SALIVA ALL OVER
IT.
[LAUGHTER]
SCIENCE HAS FOUND THE SECRET TO
GETTING THIS ECONOMY MOVING
AGAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
MONKEYS, MONKEYS, MONKEYS!
YES, MONKEYS.
AFTER RECENT EXPERIMENTS PROVED
THAT MONKEYS CAN BE TRAINED TO
UNDERSTAND AND NEWS MONEY, A
TEAM OF RESEARCHERS DECIDED TO
CREATE THE FIRST ADVERTISING
CAMPAIGN FOR NONHUMAN PRY MATES.
THIS IS BRILLIANT BECAUSE
MONKEYS HAVE TO WATCH
ADVERTISING.
THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THE
TiVo YET.
THEY ARE STILL STUCK AT POKING
THE CHANNEL CHANGE BUTTON WITH A
TERMITE STICK.
[LAUGHTER]
TO PROVE ADVERTISING WORKS ON
MONKEYS, THE TEAM CREATES TWO
BRANDS OF JELL-O, ONE OF THEM
ADVERTISED BY A BILLBOARD
CAMPAIGN THAT HANGS OUTSIDE THE
MONKEY'S ENCLESH SURE.
I BELIEVE IT WILL WORK.
WE KNOW ONE PRODUCT IS MARKETED
TO NONHUMAN PRY -- PRIMATES,
SUMMER MOVIES.
>> OH, NO!
>> I'M GOING TO HURL!
♪ ♪
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: THIS IS A TARGETED
CAMPAIGN THAT WILL USE IMAGES
THAT APPEAL TO PRIMATES WITH
PHOTOS OF THE ALPHA MALE OF
TROOP AS WELL AS A GRAPHIC SHOT
OF A FEMALE MONKEY WITH HER
GENITALS EXPOSED.
I HOPE THEY KEEP IT TASTE WFL
NONE OF AIR BRUSHED OR INJECTED
STUFF JUST BEAUTIFUL, NATURAL
MONKEY VAGINAS.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE --
[ APPLAUSE ]
-- THANK YOU.
BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WANT
IS FOR THESE ADS TO CREATE
UNREALISTIC STANDARDS OF GENITAL
ENGEORGEMENT FOR THOSE YOUNG
FEMALES OUT THERE.
THEY ARE UNDER ENOUGH PRESSURE
AS IT IS TO RAISE A FAMILY AND
EAT THE TICKS OFF OF IT.
AS A SUPERIOR SPECIES THIS
EXPERIMENT WILL TEACH US NOTHING
ABOUT OURSELVES.
HUMAN ADVERTISING WORKS ON A SEW
SOPHISTICATED LEVEL.
FOR EXAMPLE.
I BUY DIET PEPSI FOR VERY URGENT
REASONS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS WE NEED A BOOST TO
THE ECONOMY, MONKEYS ARE SUCKERS
AND THANKS TO THIS AD CAMPAIGN
SOON WE'LL HAVE ALL THEIR MONKEY
MONEY JUST BY SHOWING THEM
BILLBOARDS LIKE THIS.
