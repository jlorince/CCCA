YOU'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE50th ANNIVERSARY OF WHAT'S
CALLED FREEDOM SUMMER INMISSISSIPPI.
TELL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHATFREEDOM SUMMER WAS AND THE ROLE
YOU PLAYED IN IT.
>> WELL, FREEDOM SUMMER WAS WHENA LARGE NUMBER, ACTUALLY
THOUSANDS, OF STUDENTS FROM ALLOVER THE COUNTRY CAME TO
MISSISSIPPI TO TRY TO HELPMISSISSIPPIANS WHO WERE KEPT
FROM VOTING LEARN HOW TO VOTEAND TO GET THEM TO THE POLLS.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST REGISTER?I UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY 10%
OF BLACK VOTERS IN MISSISSIPPIIN 1964
WERE REGISTERED BEFORE YOU ANDOTHER FREEDOM RIDERS WENT DOWN
THERE TO HELP THEM REGISTER.
AND YET THEY WERE HALF THEPOPULATION, SO WHAT'S UP?
STEPHEN: YEAH, WHAT UP IS MYQUESTION.
>> WHAT WAS UP IS THEY WOULDN'TLET THEM VOTE.
THEY WOULDN'T LET THEM REGISTER.

>> Stephen: OKAY.
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME DOWN IN1963, MEDGAR EVERS MET YOU AT
THE BUS STATION.
TELL THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE AGAINWHO MEDGAR EVERS WAS AND WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIM THAT SUMMER.
>> MEDGAR EVERS WAS A MARTYROF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
MEDGAR EVERS WAS THE HEAD OF THENAACP IN THE STATE OF
MISSISSIPPI.
MISSISSIPPI WAS AT THAT POINT SOFAR BEHIND THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY THAT IT HAD NOT EVEN HADSIT-INS, THINGS WHERE WE USED TO
SIT IN AND SAY WE'RE ENTITLED TOHAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.
THEY HADN'T EVEN HAD THOSE.
HE HAD TO LEAD THOSE.
AND THERE WERE VERY FEW LAWYERS,MUCH LESS LAW STUDENTS LIKE ME,
SO WHEN I CAME, HE WANTED ME TOREMAIN IN JACKSON, WHEREAS I HAD
PROMISED TO GO TO THE DELTA,WHICH WAS THE HEART OF THE WORST
PART OF MISSISSIPPI WHERE PEOPLECOULDN'T VOTE.
HE PUT ME ON A BUS AFTER SHOWINGME AROUND JACKSON ALL DAY, WENT
HOME AND WAS SHOT IN THE BACK.
MARTYR OF THE CIVIL RIGHTSMOVEMENT.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S YOURFIRST DAY IN MISSISSIPPI.
>> VERY FIRST DAY.
>> Stephen: YOU WENT BACKAGAIN THE NEXT YEAR.
>> WELL, NEXT YEAR WAS THEMISSISSIPPI FREEDOM SUMMER.
ACTUALLY, WHAT I WAS DOING INTHE DELTA THE YEAR BEFORE WAS
THE PROTOTYPE FOR THEMISSISSIPPI FREEDOM SUMMER WHEN
THE STUDENTS WERE GOING TO COMEDOWN.
THE QUESTION IS: WHAT ARE THESTUDENTS GOING TO DO.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WORKSHOPS.
>> Stephen: OUTSIDE AGITATE IBELIEVE IS THE TECHNICAL TERM.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
AGAIN, I'M NOT THE MONSTER HERE.
BUT SHOULDN'T IT BE UP TOINDIVIDUAL STATES AS TO HOW EASY
OR HARD IT IS FOR BLACK PEOPLETO VOTE?

>> STEPHEN, HAVE YOU EVER HEARDOF THE 14th AMENDMENT?
>> Stephen: I HAVE NOT.
NO, I HAVE NOT.
NO.
I DON'T THINK IT GOES THAT HIGH.
[APPLAUSE]I DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY GOES
THAT HIGH.

>> EVERYBODY HAS TO BE TREATEDEQUALLY.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO VOTING.
