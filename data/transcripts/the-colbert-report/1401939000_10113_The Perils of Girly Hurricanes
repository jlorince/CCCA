(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
WITH US.
FOLKS,-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITHUS, TONIGHT AS ALL NIGHTS,
FOLKS AS A BIT OF A CLOTHESHORSE IT'S MY JOB TO REMIND
YOU OF THE ANNUAL FASHIONDOs AND DON'Ts.
FOR INSTANCE IT IS NOW AFTERMEMORIAL DAY SO YOU ARE
ALLOWED TO WEAR WHITE PANTS.
BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND ITBECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO
HEAR IS GOING TO MAKE YOU GOTO CODE BROWN. JIM?
>> TODAY MARKS THE BEGINNINGOF THE ATLANTIC HURRICANE
SEASON.
>> THE BEGINNING OF THEATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON.
>>> HURRICANE SEASON.
>> YES, HURRICANE SEASONSEEMS TO COME EARLIER AND
EARLIER EVERY YEAR BECAUSETHANKS TO GLOBAL WARMING IT
NEVER REALLY ENDS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT HERE'S MY NUMBER ONE
HURRICANE SEASON SAFETY TIP.
IF YOU LIVE ANYWHERE ON THECOAST FROM GALVESTON, TEXAS,
TO WILMINGTON, NORTHCAROLINA, DON'T.
(LAUGHTER)NOW WE'VE JUST FOUND OUT
WE'VE JUST FOUND OUT, FOLKS,WHEN IT COMES TO HURRICANES
THERE IS A NEW NAME FORDANGER.
AND IT'S GIRLY.
>> ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDYRESEARCHERS LOOKED AT MORE
THAN 60 YEARS OF DEATH TOLLSFROM HURRICANES AND THEY
FOUND FEMALE-NAMEDHURRICANES KILLED MORE
PEOPLE THAN THE MALE ONES.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YES.
OH YES.
WHEN IT COMES TO DESTRUCTION,THE LADY STORM SHATTERED THE
GLASS CEILING-- WELL, THEGLASS EVERYTHING.
(LAUGHTER)ACCORDING TO THE STUDY,
PEOPLE DON'T TAKE HURRICANESAS SERIOUSLY IF THEY HAVE A
FEMININE NAME.
AND NEITHER CONSIDER THEM ASRISKY NOR TAKE THE SAME
PRECAUTION.
HEY, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
I HEAR HURRICANE IRENE ISCOMING, I SAY WOW, SHE
SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY LADY.
SO I GO OUT TO GREET HER INTHE YARD WITH A BUCKET OF
NAILS.
NEXT THING I KNOW, I'MFLOATING PAST A HIGH SCHOOL
CLINGING TO A BLOATED COWCARCASS.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S THE FLOAT OF SHAME.
(LAUGHTER)THE STUDY EVEN SUGGESTS THAT
CHANGING A SEVEREHURRICANE'S NAME FROM
CHARLEY TO ELOISE COULDNEARLY TRIPLE ITS DEATH TOLL,
WHICH MEANS IF CHARLEYMANSON HAD CHANGED HIS NAME
TO ELOISE MANSON, HE WOULD HAVEBEEN THREE TIMES AS
HOMICIDAL.
BECAUSE EVERYBODY TRUSTS ANICE LADY WITH A FOREHEAD
SWASTIKA.
NOW FOLKS, THERE ARE PEOPLEOUT THERE WHO THINK THIS IS
PURE SEXISM REFLECTING ADEEP NEED FOR FROM MEANINGFUL
SOCIAL CHANGE, WHATEVER.
BUT IN THE MEANTIME I SAY WECAN USE THIS BIAS TO KEEP US
ALL SAFE THIS YEAR BY MAKINGEVERY STORM SOUND AS BAD-ASS
AND MASCULINE AS POSSIBLEWITH WEATHER ALERTS LIKE
THIS.
>> THIS SUNDAY, SUNDAY,SUNDAY, THROUGH OCTOBER,
TOBER, TOBER, EL NINOBECOMES A MAN.
AND BRINGS YOU HURRICANE BUTCH MCBALLS BACK-TO-BACK WITH
TROPICAL STORM MAGNUS VANTHUNDER CROTCH, THE CONDO KILLER
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANTTO BE THERE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: AND THAT'S--
