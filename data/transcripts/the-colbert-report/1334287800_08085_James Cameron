>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, RECENTLY SET THE WORLD RECORD FOR TRAVELING SOLO TO THE
EARTH'S DEEPEST DEPTHS.
WELL, HE'S ABOUT TO MEET THE EARTH'S SHALLOWIST MAN.
PLEASE WELCOME JAMES CAMERON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, MR. CAMERON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING.
>> Stephen: I'M IN A QUANDARY.
OBVIOUSLY I'M A BIG FAN.
WE CAN SHAKE HANDS AGAIN IF YOU WANT, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LET GO OF ME.
I UNDERSTAND THE FEELING.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ONE OF THESE HOLLYWOOD ELITE, OKAY.
POISONING THE MINDS OF OUR CHILDREN WITH YOUR ESCAPIST FANTASY MOVIES.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
CASE IN POINT, TITANIC, DID YOU SEE THAT TITANIC MOVIE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
COUPLE PEOPLE SAW THAT, YOU MADE A CHUNK OF CHANGE.
NOW THAT MOVIE I THINK HAS GOT A TERRIBLE MESSAGE FOR OUR KIDS.
THAT YOUNG WOMEN OF MEANS AND BREEDING SHOULD GO OFF WITH JUST SOME TRAMP THEY MEET.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU REALIZE THAT THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THAT MOVIE.
>> YEAH, YEAH IS.
>> Stephen: YEAH.
>> THINK HOW MUCH THE FILM COULD HAVE MADE IF WE HAD DONE IT RIGHT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT, EXACTLY.
IF YOU HAD FOCUS GROUPED THAT MOVIE AND JACK HAD LIVED, YOU COULD HAVE TURNED SOME COIN.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT A SEQUEL, A SEQUEL WHERE ROSE DOESN'T-- THE
OCEAN FOR HIS BODY.
>> WE'LL WORK ON THAT.
>> Stephen: NOW IT'S OUT RIGHT NOW IN 3-D.
WHAT DOES THE 3-D, IT WAS A SPECTACLE TO BEGIN W DON'T GET ME WRONG.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I WAS TERRIFIED IN THAT MOVIE.
I WAS, SCARY MOVIE.
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING IF I GO SEE IT IN 3-D.
WHAT IS IT GIVING YOU.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE GOAL.
THE GOAL IS TO PUT YOU ON THE SHIP.
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S A SENSE OF DEPTH, A SENSE OF BEING THERE.
THAT IS WHAT THE 3-D IS ALL ABOUT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU DO THAT TO A MOVIE SHOT IN 2-D YOU CAN'T REACH NOT FILM AND
LIKE OPEN IT LIKE A TOP HAT.
>> YEAH.
IT IS ONLY-- IF ONLY IT WERE THAT EASY.
WE HAD TO SPEND 14 MONTHS,
300 COMPUTER ARTISTS WORKING,
YOU KNOW AT SCREENS,
OUTLINING EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER, ADDING DEPTH AND DIMENSION TOFF EVERY SINGLE
OBJECT AND EVERY SINGLE FRAME.
>> Stephen: IS EVERYTHING 3-D THERE IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: EVEN WHEN THEY ARE DOING IT IN THAT CAR?
>> WE WE WORKED ESPECIALLY ON THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT SWEATIE HAND PRINT IS COMING RIGHT AT YOU.
>> YEAH.
ALTHOUGH THEY CUT IT OUT IN CHINA WE JUST FOUND OUT.
>> Stephen: THEY CUT THAT OUT IN CHINA, THAT'S TOO SEXY FOR THE CHINESE.
>> THEY WERE AFRAID THAT CHINESE MEN WOULD ACTUALLY BE REACHING OUT TOWARDS THE
SCREEN, THIS IS TRUE, YOU CAN'T MAKE-- YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP, AND THAT IT WOULD
INTERFERE WITH THE ENJOYMENT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING NEXT TO THEM.
>> Stephen: THAT THEY WOULD REACH OUT TOWARD THE SCREEN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CHINESE MEN HAVE THAT LITTLE SEX.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.
>> THIS IS A CONCERN SO IT'S BEEN EDITED.
BUT WE MADE $20 MILLION IN TWO DAYS SO I'M GOING WITH THEIR EDIT.
>> Stephen: WHOA, THAT'S NICE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN.
NOW SPEAKING OF THE OCEAN,
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE OBSESSION ABOUT THE OCEAN.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE BESIDES THE TITANIC AND 3-D, YOU DID THE ABYSS.
OKAY.
AND NOW YOU HAVE GONE DOWN TO THE DEEPEST SPOT IN THE OCEAN.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THE MARIANA TRENCH.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHERE IN THE OCEAN IS THAT THING.
>> WELL, IT'S NEAR GUAM WHICH IS WESTERN PACIFIC OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
>> Stephen: PART OF AMERICA,
SIR, IT'S NOT NOWHERE.
>> IT'S IN THE FED RATED STATES OF MICRONES YA, SIR,
ABOUT A MILE OUTSIDE OF AMERICAN WATER.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THEY HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN GOVERNMENT, [BLEEP].
>> WHOA, WHOA.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
[BLEEP].
>> ALL RIGHT, FED RATED STATES OF MICRONESIA.
>> Stephen: AND THEY HAVE A CONGRESSWOMAN, I INTERVIEWED HER.
YOU'RE ON MY TURF.
YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM THE OCEAN.
I KNOW CONGRESS.
>> ARE YOU AWARE SHE CAN'T VOTE.
>> Stephen: I DO KNOW SHE CAN'T VOTE, NEITHER CAN WASHINGTON, D.C., DOES THAT
MEAN THAT IS NOT IN THE UNITED STATES.
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU THERE.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.
NOW SO WHY GO DOWN THERE?
WHAT'S DOWN THERE, MAN.
>> WELL, IT'S THE LAST UNEXPLORED FRONTIER ON PLANET EARTH.
>> Stephen: HOW FAR DOWN ARE WE TALKING.
>> SEVEN MILES.
36,000 FEET OR 11,000 METERS.
>> Stephen: PLEASE, WE DON'T BROADCAST IN EUROPE, ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU CANADIAN.
>> I'M CANADIAN [BLEEP].
>> Stephen: NO WONDER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU WANT TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME.
>> Stephen: THAT MIGHT BE THE LEAST POLITE THING I'VE EVER HEARD A CANADIAN SAY.
SO HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GET DOWN THERE AND IN WHAT.
>> WE BUILT A SUB T TOOK US SEVEN YEARS.
AND IT IS A VEHICLE THAT I CODESIGNED WITH SOME ENGINEERS.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ARE AN INVENT TEAR.
>> APPARENTLY BECAUSE IT WORKED.
IS SO HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO DO THE DROP ALL THE WAY DOWN.
>> THE WHOLE IDEA, THE SUB IS LIKE A VERTICAL TORPEDO SO IT HAULS ASS THROUGH THE
WATER COLUMN SO THAT YOU CAN SPEND AS MUCH TIME ON THE BOTTOM AS POSSIBLE AND HAULS
ASS BACK UP SO IT IS A VERY UNCONVENTIONAL DESIGN, THAT WAS THE CONCEPT.
>> Stephen: SO THE ENTIRE TIME, IT IS ALL DARK, RIGHT.
>> PITCH-BLACK.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG ARE YOU IN THE DARKNESS DOWN THERE.
>> PRETTY OF THE WHOLE TIME,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, ANYTHING BELOW 500 FEET, WE'RE GOING DOWN TO 36,000, ANYTHING
BELOW 500 FEET PITCH-BLACK.
SO I'M AT THAT DEPTH IN LIKE A MINUTE AND A HALF.
AND SO-- .
>> Stephen: ARE WE TALKING LIKE THREE HOURS, FIVE HOURS.
>> ABOUT 10 HOURS FOR THE WHOLE THING.
>> Stephen: 10 HOURS.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: HOW BIG OF A THING ARE WE TALKING.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN THIS TABLE, THE DIAMETRE IS ABOUT 43 INCHES.
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T DRINK A LOT OF ICED TEA BEFORE YOU GOT THERE.
>> NO, NO, YOU STAY AWAY FROM A LOT OF LIQUIDES AND BEAN DINNERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
>> Stephen: DID YOU SEE ANYTHING DOWN THERE, LIKE WAS THE KRAKEN DOWN THERE?
WAS --
>> IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY CHANCE WHATSOEVER OF A GIANT SQUID OR CRACKEN I
WOULD HAVE BEEN PUTTING BAIT ALL OVER THAT SUB.
>> Stephen: TO TRY TO GET THEM TO COME CLOSE.
>> BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE SHOT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: IT WOULD, YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR, NOT ME.
>> RIGHT, NO, THE ANIMALS ARE QUITE SMALL DOWN THERE BECAUSE NATURE IS ADAPTING
TO THE PRESSURE, THE LACK OF FOOD SUPPLY AND ALL THAT.
IT'S THE MOST HARSH EXTREME ENVIRONMENT ON PLANET EARTH.
>> Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
THAT NECKLACE THE LADY THOSE OFF THE BOAT IN TITANIC, YOU WERE GOING AFTER THAT,
WEREN'T YOU?
(LAUGHTER) DID YOU GET THAT THING,
BECAUSE THAT MUST BE MEGABUCKS, THAT MUST BE HUGE COIN.
JAMES CAMERON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
JAMES CAMERON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: TITANIC 3-D IN
