>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
ABOUT ANTARCTIC PENGUINS.
IF I LIKE HIS ANSWERS, I'LL
THROW HIM A MACKEREL.
PLEASE WELCOME FEN MONTAIGNE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
HEY.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, YOUR NEW
BOOK IS CALLED "FRASER'S
PENGUINS, A JOURNEY TO THE
FUTURE IN TAN DARK CA."
WHO IS FRASER?
>> BILL FRASER IS A SCIENTIST
THAT'S BEEN ON THE ANTARCTIC
PENINSULA FOR 35B9 YEARS
STUDYING THERE.
HE'S WITNESSED THIS VERY, VERY
HAPPEN PIT WARNING THAT'S HAD A
BAD IMPACT ON WHAT...
>> Stephen: WHAT WARMING.
THAT WOULD.
>> THAT WOULD BE GLOBAL WARMING.
>> Stephen: GLOBAL WARMING IS
NO LONGER HAPPENING.
IT WAS VERY POPULAR IN 2007.
I BELIEVED THAT'S BECAUSE AL
GORE'S MOVIE MADE MUST BE.
BUT NOW HE'S GETTING DIVORCED.
DID YOU FEEL WARM OUT THERE WHEN
YOU WERE WAITING FOR THE SHOW?
>> AUDIENCE: NO.
>> THE STRANGEST THING IS
HAPPENING.
EVEN DESPITE THIS NEW CONGRESS
AMERICA OF WHOSE MEMBERS DON'T
BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING, IT'S
STILL GOING ON.
>> Stephen: THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE VOTED THAT IT'S NOT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> NATURE HAS THE LAST WORD, AND
I'M AFRAID IF YOU GO TO POLAR
REASONS LIKE WHERE I SPENT FIVE
MONTHS IN ANTARCTICA.
THESE ICE
>> DEPENDENT PENGUINS, THE
LOVELY TUXEDOED LITTLE BIRDS...
>> Stephen: YOU SPENT FIVE
MONTHS THERE?
>> I DID, FIVE MONTHS.
>> Stephen: WHAT PART OF YOUR
BODY DID YOU MISS FEELING THE
MOST?
>> THE ODD THING WAS IT WASN'T
THAT COLD.
I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF
POINT.
THE HIGH TEMPERATURE WAS 52
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
THAT SHOULD NOT BE.
THAT'S WARM.
>> Stephen: WHY SHOULD I CARE
ABOUT THESE PENGUINS.
SELL ME ON THIS BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, WE'VE LOST PENGUINS
BEFORE, SIR.
THE GREAT AUK, ARE YOU FAMILIAR?
19th CENTURY ATLANTIC
PENGUIN.
>> RIGHT.
>> GONE.
>> Stephen: CIVILIZATION DID
NOT FALL.
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WHEN
THEY WERE BASICALLY HUNTED TO
DISTINCTION.
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE ARE
CHANGING THE CLIMATE UNDER WHICH
CIVILIZATION HAS ARISEN OVER THE
LAST 12,000 YEARS.
IN ESSENCE OUR... THE LONG ARM
OF INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION HAS
REACHED DOWN THERE, WARMED UP
THE WINTER TEMPERATURES BY 11
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, MELTED A LOT
OF THE SEA ICE, AND THESE
PENGUINS MANY THIS PART OF TAN
ANTARCTICA ARE DYING OUT.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO THEY EAT?
>> KRILL.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING
PENGUINS ARE MORE VALUABLE THAN
KR ILL BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY.
>> WELL, THE KRILL ARE DEPENDENT
ON THE COLD, TOO.
BILL FRASER, THE SCIENTIST I'M
WRITING ABOUT.
HE'S BEEN THERE SINCE 1974, OFF
AND ON.
>> Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.
HE'D GET ICE MADNESS.
>> HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES ARE
SEEING RAPID CHANGES AT THE
POLES THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY
COMING OUR WAY.
WE CAN PRETEND THEY'RE NOT, BUT
THEY ARE.
IT'S THE LAW OF PHYSICS.
>> Stephen: HOW LONG BEFORE
THESE SUPPOSED EVENTS IN ABOUT
ART CASH BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE EVEN
IS AN ANTARCTICA, HOW LONG
BEFORE THEY AFFECT ME?
>> I THINK THIS CENTURY YOU'RE
PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE MELTING
OF GREENLAND AN THE WEST ABOUT
ANTARCTIC, SO THREE TO SIX FEET
OF SEA LEVEL RISING.
I'M GOING TO SAY 2100.
>> Stephen: I'LL BE DEAD.
>> YOU'LL BE DEAD, BUT YOU HAVE
KIDS.
>> Stephen: ACCORDING TO YOU
SCIENCE PEOPLE, THEY'LL EVOLVE
GILLS.
>> THEY WON'T.
AND ANTARCTICA IS THE GREATEST
REPOSITORY OF ICE IN THE WORLD.
UP TO THREE MILES DEEP IN ICE.
WHAT THE WARMING OF THE ABOUT
ART TICK PENINSULA REPRESENTS IS
FIRST BREECH IN THE CITADEL OF
ICE.
>> Stephen: CITADEL OF ICE?
ISN'T THAT WHERE SUPERMAN LIVES.
>> HE DID LIVE THERE ONCE.
BUT IF THIS STARTS TO MELT, YOU
ARE LOOKING AT MAJOR, MAJOR SEA
LEVEL RISES IN THE COMING
CENTURIES.
IT'S NOT IN YOUR LIFETIME, BUT
IN YOUR DESCENDANT'S LIFETIME
FOR SURE.
>> Stephen: WELL,
MR. MONTAIGNE, IT'S AN IMPORTANT
MESSAGE.
I WISH I BELIEVED IT.
>> THANK YOU, STE
