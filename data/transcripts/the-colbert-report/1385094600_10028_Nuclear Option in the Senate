( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I GOT A--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ONTHIS, THE LAST DAY OF AMERICA,
BECAUSE, FOLKS, IT IS ALL OVER.
I AM-- I AM PACKING UP ANDGETTING OUT OF THIS COUNTRY AND
MOVING BACK TO SOUTH CAROLINA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND HERE'S WHY--
>> BREAKING NEWS, SENATEDEMOCRATS VOTE TO APPROVE THE
SO-CALLED NUCLEAR OPTIONS.
>> BEFORE THE DEMOCRATS VOTED TOCHANGE THE RULES, THE NUCLEAR
OPTION THROUGH THAT UP, TOTALLYCHANGED THE RULES.
>> THEY CHANGED FILIBUSTER RULESTO END THE 60 VOTE THRESHOLD.
>> Stephen:  THEY USED THENUCLEAR OPTION.
THAT WILL GIVE CONGRESSRADIATION BURNS.
( LAUGHTER )TOO LATE!
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, THAT SCARED THE SOCKS
OFF-- I'LL PACK MY UNDERWEARSUITCASE LATER.
FOLKS, WE HAVE JUST WITNESSTHEDEATH OF AN AMERICAN
INSTITUTION, THE POWER OF THEMINORITY TO FILIBUSTER ANYTHING
THEY DIDN'T LIKE IS ONE OF OURFOUNDING PRINCIPLES.
THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT IN THECONSTITUTION.
( LAUGHTER )IT WAS GOING TO BE, BUT IT GOT
FILIBUSTERD, WHICH SHOWS HOWNECESSARY IT IS, OR ELSE THAT
CRAP WOULD BE IN THECONSTITUTION.
( LAUGHTER )AND JUST LISTEN, JUST LISTEN TO
THE FLIMSY EXCUSE OFFERED BYSENATE MAJORITY DICTATOR HARRY
REID.
>> IN THE HISTORY OF OURCOUNTRY, SOME 230-PLUS YEARS,
THERE HAVE BEEN 160 FILIBUSTERSOF EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL
NOMINATIONS.
HALF OF THEM HAVE OCCURREDDURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
ONLY 23 DISTRICT COURTNOMINATIONS HAVE BEEN
FILIBUSTERED IN THE ENTIREHISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, 23.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
20 OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN THE LASTFOUR AND A HALF YEARS.
>> Stephen:  HEY, REPUBLICANSWOULDN'T HAVE TO BLOCK THEM IF
OBAMA NOMINATED CONSERVATIVES,LIKE, SAY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR
CHUCK HAGEL.
I MEAN, THAT GUY-- WHAT'S THAT?
THEY FILIBUSTERED HIM, TOO?
WELL, THAT JUST PROVES THEY'REBIPARTISAN.
THEY'LL FILIBUSTER ANYONE OBAMANOMINATES.
( LAUGHTER )AND WE CAN'T TRUST THE DEMOCRATS
WITH ALL THIS POWERS, FOLKS.
THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.
AT HARRY REID'S PRESS CONFERENCEANNOUNCING THE END OF THE
FILIBUSTER, THEY MISSPELLEDFILIBUSTER WITH TWO "Ls."
( LAUGHTER )THAT SAYS PHILLY-BUSTERS, WHICH
I ASSUME ARE COPS WHO ARRESTFEMALE HORSES.
( LAUGHTER )AND I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THE
DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY AGAINST THEFILIBUSTER.
BECAUSE THEIR POSTER CLEARLYSAYS THEY'RE AGAIN-STS THIS
SPEM.
BUT THEY NIEWKD IT.
THEY WENT AHEAD AND NIEWKD IT.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN INWASHINGTON NOW?
SOMETHING?
WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO ACHIEVINGA ZEN-LIKE STATE OF PERFECT
GOVERNMENT NOTHINGNESS.
NOT SINCE BUDDHA HAVE SO MANY
