ANYWAY, I THINK THAT'S CUTE OVER TO YOU STEPHEN.
THANKS, STEVE!
[LAUGHTER]
NATION, NO ONE IS A BIGGER FAN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAN YOURS TRULY.
I EVEN ATTENDED 1963'S HISTORIC MARCH ON WASHINGTON-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- WHILE STILL IN MY
MOTHER'S WOMB.
[LAUGHTER]
I'LL NEVER FORGET MARTIN LUTHER KING'S STIRRING WORDS.
[HEARTBEAT SOUNDS]
[MUFFLED VOICE]
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHY I'M PERSONALLY INVESTED IN A CHALLENGE TO THE 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT NOW
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE LAW THAT BANNED THE SILENCING OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IS FINALLY COMING BEFORE OUR
NATION'S FOREMOST SILENT AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT BLACK PEOPLE WERE REGULARLY KEPT FROM VOTING WITH
ROADBLOCKS LIKE LITERACY TESTS, POLL TAXES, AND "YOU MUST BE THIS WHITE TO VOTE" SIGNS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW THAT LAW IS BEING CHALLENGED IN THE SUPREME COURT BY SHELBY COUNTY, ALABAMA.
THEY ARGUE THAT THE LAW IS UNFAIR, BECAUSE IT APPLIES ONLY TO STATES WITH HISTORIES OF
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION: ALABAMA, ARIZONA, GEORGIA, LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, SOUTH
CAROLINA, TEXAS, PARTS OF CAROLINA, TEXAS, VIRGINIA, AND ALASKA, WHICH HAS A SAD HISTORY
OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ITS AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION BRIAN.
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD GUY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S A GOOD GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE'S ONE KEY REASON TO STRIKE THIS ACT DOWN, AS SHELBY -- THERE'S ONE REASON TO GET RID
OF THIS LAW AS SHELBY COUNTY LAWYER BERT REIN EXPLAINED TO THE COURT.
>> THE PROBLEM TO WHICH THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS ADDRESSED IS SOLVED.
>> Stephen: YOU HEARD IT, FOLKS: RACISM IS SOLVED!
JIMMY, DROP THE FULLY INTEGRATED BALLOONS!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE OVERCAME IT!
WHOO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOOK AT THAT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOOK AT THAT!
LOOK AT THAT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOW, I MUST HAVE MISSED THE MOMENT WHEN RACISM ENDED.
I WONDER WHEN IT WAS?
THE TIME ROSS DATED AISHA TYLER ON "FRIENDS"?
[LAUGHTER]
OR WHEN KEEBLER ADDED A BLACK ELF?
[LAUGHTER]
OH, I KNOW, IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN THEY MADE SLAVERY ILLEGAL IN MISSISSIPPI ALL THE WAY BACK
IN FOUR WEEKS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
[ APPLAUSE ]
IN FACT, WE'RE LIVING IN SUCH A POST-RACIAL UTOPIA THAT WE COULDN'T SUPPRESS BLACK VOTES
EVEN IF WE WANTED TO!
WHICH WE DEFINITELY DON'T.
[LAUGHTER]
LUCKILY CONSERVATIVE STALWART AND JUSTICE-THE-HUTT ANTONIN SCALIA KNOWS THAT THE COURTS
HAVE TO DECIDE THIS, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH RACISM IS OVER, AMERICA'S ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES LACK THE
BICAMERAL BALL SACK TO VOTE AGAINST THIS THING.
>> I AM FAIRLY CONFIDENT IT WILL BE REENACTED IN PERPETUITY UNLESS-- UNLESS A COURT CAN SAY
IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH THE CONSTITUTION.
IT'S-- IT'S A CONCERN THAT THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF A QUESTION YOU CAN LEAVE TO CONGRESS.
EVEN THE NAME OF IT IS WONDERFUL: THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
WHO IS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THAT IN THE FUTURE?
>> Stephen: YES, YOU'D HAVE TO BE AN A-HOLE TO VOTE AGAINST THAT IN THE FUTURE!
LUCKILY, WE'VE GOT AN A-HOLE WHO WILL VOTE AGAINST IT IN THE PRESENT.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS, THE VOTING RIGHTS
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS OBSOLETE IT'S LIKE AN OLD RESTRAINING ORDER.
THESE STATES ARE JUST SAYING, "YES, I USED TO BEAT MY GIRLFRIEND, BUT I HAVEN'T SINCE
