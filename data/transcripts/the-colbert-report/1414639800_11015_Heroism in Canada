>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIT DOWN.THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS JOBIS I'M LEARNING SOMETHING NEW
ALL THE TIME.
FOR INSTANCE I JUST FOUND OUTCANADA HAS ITS OWN GOVERNMENT.
[LAUGHTER]EVEN MORE SHOCKING, IT IS NOT
LED BY WAYNE GRETZKY.
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE IGUESS.
LAST WEEK IN OTTAWA A LONE GUNMAN OPENED FIRE ON PARLIAMENT
HILL, KILLING A SOLDIER THENCONTINUING HIS SHOOTING SPREE
INSIDE THE BUILDING. A SHOCKINGATTACK AND ALL AMERICANS SHARE
IN OUR NEIGHBORS GRIEF OVERTHE SENSELESS TRAGEDY.
BUT AS HORRIFIC AS THIS INCIDENTWAS,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE IFIT HADN'T BEEN STOPPED BY THE
HOUSE OF COMMONSSERGEANT-AT-ARMS KEVIN VICKERS
SEEN HERE WITH HIS CEREMONIALGIANT BABY RATTLE.
[LAUGHTER]HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
>> AFTER EXCHANGING GUNSHOTSWITH THE PARLIAMENTARY SECURITY
TEAM AT THE ENTRANCE OF CENTERBLOCK THAT'S RIGHT HERE, HE MADE
HIS WAY TO THE END OF THE HALLOF HONOR BESIDE THE LIBRARY
THESE DOORS TO THE RIGHT IS ASMALL ALCOVE PROTECTED BY THIS
PILLAR AND HE TUCKS HIMSELF INTHERE AND HIDES.
KEVIN VICKERS OFFICE IS RIGHTAROUND THE CORNER.
HE HEARS THE GUNSHOT.
HE GRABS A HIS SIDEARM, ANAUTOMATIC PISTOL.
HE EXITS HIS OFFICE AND HEIMMEDIATELY RUNS TOWARDS THE
PILLAR HERE.
BIBEAU IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THEY'RE LITERALLY AT ARM'SLENGTH JUST AROUND THE PILLAR.
THE SERGEANT OF ARMS COULDACTUALLY SEE THE BARREL OF THE
GUN STICKING OUT FROM BEHIND THEPILLAR. HE DOESN'T HESITATE.
KEVIN VICKERS TAKES HIS SIDE ARMAND DIVES AROUND THE PILLAR TO
THE GROUND.
WHILE HE'S IN THE AIR HE SPINS,TO LAND ON HIS BACK, FIRING UP,
HITTING BIBEAU AS HE HITS THEGROUND.
TO HELL WITH BRUCE WILLIS.
THIS GUY, OUR NEIGHBOR TO THENORTH JUST PUT THE EH IN
YIPPY-KAY-EH, MOTHER (BLEEP)
THE VERY NEXT DAY.
LISTEN TO THIS, THE VERY NEXTDAY VICKERS RETURNED TO WORK AND
PARLIAMENT TORE THE ROOF OFF.

MOST CANADIAN THING I CANIMAGINE AND SAY I AM SORRY.
