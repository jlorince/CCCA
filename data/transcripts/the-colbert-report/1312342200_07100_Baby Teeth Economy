[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH
WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO LOSING
MONEY IN THIS RECESSION, NO ONE
IS IMMUNE.
AND THIS ROUGH ECONOMY'S EVEN
BEGUN TO AFFECT OUR KIDS.
>> CHECK OUT WHAT A NEW SURVEY
BY VISA SHOWS.
THIS YEAR THE TOOTH FAIRY IS
LEAVING AN AVERAGE OF $2.60 PER
TOOTH.
THAT'S A 40-CENT DECREASE FROM
LAST YEAR.
[ADDING]
>> Stephen: THAT MEANS THE
AVERAGE KID'S MOUTH PORTFOLIO
WILL MAX OUT AT $52!
[LAUGHTER]
JUST ONE MORE REASON I'VE BEEN
URGING MY KIDS TO DIVERSIFY INTO
TUSKS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, IT'S TEMPTING TO BLAME
THE TOOTH FAIRY.
AFTER ALL, SHE'S THE FACE OF THE
INDUSTRY.
BUT KEEP IN MIND, SHE'S JUST A
BROKER -- A MIDDLE-FAIRY ON THE
TOOTH SUPPLY CHAIN.
WHAT SHE PAYS HER SUPPLIERS IS
DETERMINED BY MACRO-TOOTH-ENOMIC
PRESSURES AND BI-CUSPID
SPECULATORS.my
BUT WE KNOW BABY TEETH, LIKE
GOLD, WILL NEVER BE WORTH
NOTHING -- BECAUSE BABY TEETH
HAVE SO MANY PRACTICAL
APPLICATIONS.
FOR INSTANCE, THEY ARE COLLECTED
AND GROUND UP TO MAKE FAIRY
DUST.
ALSO, A MAJOR INGREDIENT IN
METH.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THE TOOTH MARKET TANKING
COULDN'T COME AT A WORSE TIME
FOR THE KID ECONOMY.
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE LABOR
DEPARTMENT'S DISMAL OUTLOOK FOR
SUMMER CHORES.
AND EARLY REPORTS INDICATE THIS
COULD BE A RECORD-LOW YEAR FOR
QUARTERS FOUND BEHIND EARS.
BUT DON'T DESPAIR, KIDS. THIS
SOFT TOOTH MARKET COULD WORK TO
YOUR ADVANTAGE IF YOU PLAY IT
RIGHT.
TO GET THE PRICE OF TEETH BACK
UP WE NEED TO REDUCE INVENTORY.
THAT'S RIGHT, KIDS: STOP LOSING
TEETH.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT MEANS NO TAFFY, NO CARAMEL
APPLES, AND UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU
LET YOUR BIG SISTER TIE A STRING
TO YOUR TOOTH THEN TIE THE OTHER
END TO THE BACK OF HER
MOTORCYCLE AND DRIVE OFF!
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
IT'S AUSTERITY TIME!
NOW, BEFORE YOU ACT ON MY
FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM OBLIGATED
TO DISCLOSE THAT I INVESTED
EVERYTHING IN BABY TEETH.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
DON'T WORRY, SOME OF THESE ARE
MINE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SURE THING.
I'D JUST SOCK THEM AWAY, LET THE
TOOTH MARKET RISE OVER TIME, AND
ONCE I'M 65, PUT THEM ALL UNDER
MY PILLOW AND WAKE UP THE NEXT
MORNING WITH $20 MILLION.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW I AM SCREWED UNLESS MY
BACK-UP PLAN WORKS -- PLANTING
THESE BABY TEETH IN MY BACKYARD
AND GROW SOME BABIES.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S WHERE
THEY COME FROM.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THOSE THINGS ARE WORTH A
FORTUNE ON THE BLACK MARKET.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
