>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I DON'T LIKE TO EAT AND RUN.
THAT'S WHY I DO ALL MY EATING ON MY ELYPTICAL MACHINE.
THIS IS "THOUGHT FOR FOOD." ♪ ♪ FOLKS, WHENEVER I AM FOODING OR
BEING FUDDED, I WANT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF SITTING PERFECTLY STILL WHILE FOOD IS
BROUGHT NEAR MY MOUTH.ï¿½ï¿½ SO, I WAS THRILLED TO LEARN THAT THERE'S A NEW COMPANY PROPOSING
THE DELIVERY OF TACOS VIA UNMANNED DRONE HELICOPTERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND NO, YOU'RE NOT DREAMING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE NAME OF THE COMPANY THAT WILL BRINGING YOU FRESH TACOS BY HELICOPTER?
TACOCOPTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AT LONG LAST.
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES A TACO STAND HAS REFUSED TO DELIVER TO ME, JUST BECAUSE I'M
HALFWAY UP A K-2, OR STRANDED ON THE ROOF OF A FARMHOUSE IN A FLOODED VALLEY.
BUT THANKS TO THE IMAGINEERS AT TACOCOPTER, NOW WHEREVER I AM,
BY SENDING MY CELL PHONE'S GPS COORDNATES I CAN CALL IN A SURGICAL FLAVOR STRIKE THAT WILL
LEVEL MY HUNGER WITH SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL DELICIOUSNESS.zV
[ LAUGHTER ]
FORGET THE ARMS RACE.
WE ARE WINNING THE STOMACH RACE.
TACOCOPTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO ACHIEVING INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MUNCHIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND IT'S LESS RISKY THAN MY CURRENT METHOD OF GETTING TAKEOUT FROM MEAL TEAM SIX.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY ARE HEROS, YOU KNOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, THIS IS A GREAT DAY,
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING: TACOCOPTER IS BEING BLOCKED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
[BOOS] YES -- VERY GOOD.
YES, BARACK OBAMA IS TACO-BLOCKING ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ACCORDING TO TACOCOPTER'S CO-FOUNDER, "CURRENT U.S. FAA REGULATIONS PREVENT USING
UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AT THE MOMENT.
IT'S NOT TOTALLY UNREASONABLE TO REGULATE SOMETHING AS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AS HAVING
FLYING ROBOTS SLINGING TACOS OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
YES, YOU COULD BE WATCHING YOUR KIDS' SOCCER GAME AND CALL IN THAT FOUR-BLADED TACO-CHOPPER
AND A BIG GUST OF WIND COMES ALONG, AND IT GOES CAREENING ONTO THE FIELD AND YOU HAVE EYES
AND TEETH EVERYWHERE.
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TACOS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES TO OVERCOME WITH ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY.
IN THIS CASE KEEPING THE FOOD WARM, FLYING IN THE SNOW, FLYING IN THE RAIN, AVOIDING POWER
LINES, AVOIDING BIRDS, KEEPING BIRDS AWAY FROM YOUR TACOS,
KEEPING PEOPLE FROM STEALING THE TACOCOPTER.
AND OF COURSE, EVADING THE RADAR SYSTEMS ON ANTI-TACOCOPTER MISSILES LAUNCHED BY HUNAN PALACE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: I WANT TACOS DELIVERED TO ME BY
UNMANNED AERIAL DRONE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE IF WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS,
PERHAPS ONE DAY I CAN FINALLY REALIZE MY DREAM OF EATING A BURRITO LAUNCHED FROM A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I JUST PRAY OUR ENEMIES NEVER GET THEIR HANDS ON OUR LUNCH CODES.
