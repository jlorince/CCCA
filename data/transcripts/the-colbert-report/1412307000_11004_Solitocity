>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THEREPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WELCOME BACK.
NATION, I GOTTA TELL YOU-- AND IDON'T SUPPOSE IT'S NECESSARILY
ANY KIND OF NEWS FLASH RIGHTNOW, BUT BEING RICH IS GREAT.
THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS SOMETIMESYOU ENCOUNTER PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LESS MONEY THAN YOU HAVE.
AND WHAT WE RICH PEOPLE WANTMORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS TO
FEEL SEPARATE IN OUREXCLUSIVENESS.
THIS IS A STATE KNOWN ADDSOLITOCITY.
IT'S A SECRET WORD THAT ONLYRICH PEOPLE USE.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S ON THE SPECIAL S.A.T. THAT
WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE BECAUSETHE COLLEGE HAS A BUILDING NAMED
AFTER US.
THIS NEED FOR EXCLUSIVITY IS WHYWE HAVE OUR OWN PRIVATE JETS,
OUR OWN PRIVATE ISLANDS, EVENOUR OWN PRIVATE PARTS.
( LAUGHTER )I MEAN, IMAGINE GOING THROUGH
LIFE WITH ONLY ONE SET OFGENITALS.
I PITY YOU.
( LAUGHTER )WE NEED TO BE AWAY FROM YOU
NORMALS WHICH IS WHY I WASSO INSPIRED BY AN INNOVATION IN
EXCLUSIVITY PIONEERED BY VINODHOSLA, A SILICON VALLEY
ZILLIONAIRE AND BARACK OBAMAVINDALOO.
KHOSLA OWNS 53 ACRES OF BEACHFRONT PROPERTY ON THE PACIFIC
COAST BUT BECAUSE OF SOME DUMBRULE THAT YOU CAN'T BUY THE
OCEAN, THE UNWASHED MASSES KEPTUP-WASHING ON HIS BEACH NEAR HIS
PROPERTY AND HE TOOK ACTION.
>> KHOSLA GAINED CONTROL TO THEONLY ROAD TO THE BEACH, BUILT A
GATE, AND CALLED THE COPS.
FAMILIES WHO HAD FLOCKED HEREFOR GENERATIONS WERE SUDDENLY
SHUT OUT.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT THEYSAY-- YOU CAN'T BUY HAPPENNESS,
BUT KHOSLA PROVED YOU CAN BUYOTHER PEOPLE'S SADNESS.
UNFORTUNATELY, KHOSLA'S PLAN HITA BUMP IN THE ROADBLOCK.
>> THE JUDGE HAS RULED AGAINST ABILLIONAIRE WHO CLOSED OFF
ACCESS TO MARTINS BEACH, EVENTHOUGH KHOSLA OWNS THE 53-ACRE
BEACHFRONT PROPERTY, THE ENTIRECALIFORNIA COAST BELOW THE HIGH
TIDE LINE IS ACTUALLY PUBLICPROPERTY.
>> Stephen: KHOSLA IS ATREND-SETTER AND OTHER OPULENT
AMERICANS ARE ALREADY FOLLOWINGIN HIS FOOTSTEPS ON THE BEACH.
THIS TIME THERE'S ONLY ONE SETIN THE SAND.
BECAUSE JESUS COULDN'T GET PASTTHE GATES.
( LAUGHTER )JIM.
>> THAT HASN'T STOPPED OTHERBEACHED FRONT HOME OWNERS FROM
INSTALLING FAKE "NO PARKING"SIGNS, HIDING ACCESS POINTS AND
DISGUISING SOME CURBS AS FIRELANES.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY'REKEEPING THE PUBLIC AWAY WITH
FAKE FIRE LANES IN FRONT OFTHEIR HOUSE WHICH, AS A BONUS,
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAN USE TOPARK THEIR TRUCKS WHEN AN ANGRY
MOB SETS FIRE TO THEIR HOUSE.
BUT BEST OF ALL--( APPLAUSE )
BEST OF ALL OF THESE GUYS--( APPLAUSE )
BEST OF ALL IS CALIFORNIA MEDIAMOGUL DAVID GEFFEN WHO IS
EVIDENTLY TIRED OF BEACHGOERSPARKING NEAR HIS HOUSE AND HE
FOUND AN INGENIOUS NEW WAY TOTELL THEM TO GEFF OFF MY LAWN.
>> THESE ARE DESIGNED TO LOOKLIKE GARAGE DOORS BUT THEY'RE
NOT ACTUALLY GARAGE DOORS.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN'T PARKHERE, BUT IF YOU LOOK REALLY,
REALLY CLOSELY, THESE AREACTUALLY SEALED SHUT.
>> Stephen: YES, THESE FAKEGARAGE DOORS ARE KEEPING
BEACHGOERS AWAY AND IF HE PAINTA TUNNEL ON THEM HE CAN FINALLY
DEFEAT THAT COYOTE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I APPLAUD-- YOU APPLAUDAND I APPLAUD THESE TRAILBLAZERS
BECAUSE AS A WEALTH-AMERICAN, ITOO SUFFER THE INDIGNITY OF
SHARING THE WORLD WITH OTHERS.
IT'S SO DISTASTEFUL DRIVING ONTHE SAME ROAD WITH THE NORMALLY
MONIED.
NOW I DRIVE WHEREVER I WANTBECAUSE I HAVE A YIELD SIGN
ATTACHED TO MY FRONT BUMPER.
BUT ONCE I GET WHERE I'M GOING,I STILL WANT THE PRIVACY.
THAT'S WHY NOW I ALWAYS TRAVELWITH MY OWN VELVET-ROPED
V.I.P. SECTION.
YES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THIS-- THIS CREATES AN
INPENETRABLE ZONE OF SOLITOCITYAROUND MY NECK.
NOW NOT ONLY AM I LIVING IN THECHAMPAGNE ROOM, BUT IT COMES
WITH A GETAWAY STRAP SO AT AMOMENT'S NOTICE I CAN ESCAPE THE
RABBLE.
I JUST USE MY REMOTE CONTROL,AND THEN ONCE THE STRAP DESCENDS
I MERELY ATTACH THE STRAP TOTHIS, AND IF I RUN INTO ANY
HOI POLLOI, I MERELY WHISKMYSELF AWAY TO A RESORT
SO EXCLUSIVE NO ONE HAS EVERRETURNED.
JIMMY!
JIMMY!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
