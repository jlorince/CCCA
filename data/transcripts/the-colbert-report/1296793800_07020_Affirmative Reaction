>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, SOME OF YOU KNOW WE
ARE OFF NEXT WEEK BUT I
CANNOT GO ON VACATION
WITHOUT CELEBRATING BLACK
HISTORY MONTH.
LEGALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S PART OF A
SETTLEMENT.
ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO
APOLOGISE TO THE OFFENDED
CUB SCOUTS.
THAT WORD I USED WAS JUST
WHAT WE IN SOUTH CAROLINA
CALLED IS A MORES.
NOW I DON'T SEE RACE, FOLKS.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND
I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I
HAVE NO DESIRE TO CELEBRATE
BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
AND AS A WHITE GUY I'M TIRED
MUCH BEING REMINDED OF ALL
THE BAD STUFF WE DID TO
BLACK PEOPLE FROM SLAVERY TO
JIM CROWE TO MAKING THEM THE
ONLY BLACK GUY ON STAR WARS
A TRAITOR.
SO MAY I POINT OUT, MAY I
POINT OUT, HE PUT A WHITE
GUY IN CARBON IDENTITY AND
THEN SOLD HIM.
I THINK WE'RE EVEN.
NEVERTHELESS, TONIGHT I
CELEBRATE A HERO OF BLACK
HISTORY, OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN
KASICH, WHO HAS STIRRED THE
PASSIONS OF THE OHIO BLACK
COMMUNITY.
>> OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH
HAS APPOINTED NEARLY TWO
DOZEN CABINET MEMBERS AND SO
FAR NOT ONE IS
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR
HISPANIC.
>> WE PICK PEOPLE ON THE
BASIS OF WHO'S QUALIFIED.
WE DON'T PICK THEM ON THE
BASIS OF QUOTAS.
>> Stephen: YEAH, HE'S JUST
PUTTING TOGETHER THE BEST
POSSIBLE TEAM.
LIKE THE MIGHTY MORPHING POG
WE ARE RANGERS.
IF THEY WERE ALL THE WHITE
ONES.
NOW CASE IG DEFENDED HIS
DIVERSITY CREDENTIAL BY
POINTING OUT THAT HIS
LT. GOVERNOR WAS A WOMAN.
ADDING QOINGT, I'M MARRIED
TO A WOMAN WITH TWO
DAUGHTERS, OKAY.
OKAY?
HE CHOSE TO MARRY A WOMAN.
AND IF HE IS IMPLYING THAT
THAT WAS A TOUGH CALL THAT
MEANS HE'S GAY, GAY, GAY,
GAY, GAY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: HE STILL
BELIEVES IN DIVERSITY THAT
HE CLOSED HIS EYES, IMAGINED
TAX CUTS AND MANAGED TO HAVE
TWO DAUGHTERS.
BY THE WAY, HAVING DAUGHTERS,
ALSO A CHOICE.
BECAUSE THE MAN IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GENDER
OF THE CHILD.
BEEN YOU-- BEFORE YOU GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS YOU TAKE
OUT A SHARPIE AND RIGHT GIRL
ON YOUR PENIS.
OR FEMALE IF YOU'VE GOT THE
ROOM FOR IT.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT SOME BLACK LEADERS ARE
STILL GOING AFTER HIM.
>> HE'S ASKED IN HIS
INAUGURAL ADDRESS TO BE
JUDGED BY WHAT HE DOES.
AND SO FAR WHAT HE HAS DONE
IS UNACCEPTABLE.
>> I THINK THIS IS AN ERR OF
JUDGEMENT ON HIS PART WHICH
CAN BE DIRECTED IF HE IS NOT
A RACIST.
>> GOVERNOR KASICH HAS
DECLARED THAT OHIO IS OPEN
FOR BUSINESS BUT IF YOU ARE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOU NEED
NOT APPLY.
IF YOU ARE HISPANIC, YOU
NEED NOT APPLY.
IF YOU ARE ASIAN-- ASIAN
INDIAN, YOU NEED NOT APPLY.
>> THAT IS NOT RACIAL.
THESE DAYS WHEN IT COMES TO
JOBS, IF YOU LIVE IN OHIO,
YOU NEED NOT APPLY.
FOLKS, NEVERTHELESS, JOHN
KASICH HEARD THE CRY OF THE
BLACK COMMUNITY AND TOOK
BOLD ACTION.
FIRST HE ISSUED A
PROCLAMATION HONORING MARTIN
LUTHER KING'S BIRTHDAY MARCH
17th.
NOW TECHNICALLY THAT IS NOT
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S
BIRTHDAY, IT'S ST. PATRICK'S
DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I SAY THAT'S A
PROMOTION.
THEN KASICH ANNOUNCED THE
APPOINTMENT OF AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN LYNN
STEVENS TO BE HIS NEW
DIRECTOR OF MINORITY
AFFAIRS.
NOBODY SAW THAT ONE COMING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BECAUSE THAT WAS ALREADY
HER JOB.
BUT REMEMBER, HE LET HER
KEEP HER JOB.
AND I'M SURPRISED.
AFTER ALL SHE'S INVOLVED IN
MINORITY OUTREACH AND HAVE
YOU SEEN KASICH'S CABINET.
THEY ARE WHITER THAN MY
RIDING STAFF.
AND THIS WEEK KASICH
APPOINTED A BLACK MAN TO
HEAD THE CABINET LEVEL OHIO
DEPARTMENT OF JOBS AND
FAMILY SERVICES.
WHO IS PERFECT FOR THIS
POSITION.
BECAUSE AGAIN, HE ALREADY
HAD THAT THE JOB AS INTERIM
HEAD.
THAT MAN'S NAME, MICHAEL B
COLBERT.
YES.
COLBERT.
THAT MEANS I AM PROBABLY
BLACK.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND AS A MAYBE BLACK MAN, I
WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR
KASICH FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO
THE OTHER
