[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT TODAY IS THE OFFICIAL RELEASE DATE OF MY BELOVED
"I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU." IT'S THE HEARTWARMING COMING OF AGE STORY OF A POLE SEARCHING
FOR IT'S PLACE IN THE WORLD.
IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY, FATHER'S DAY, GRADUATION DAY, AND ALL OTHER DAYS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD, BECAUSE OF THIS BLURB.
"THE SAD THING IS, I LIKE IT!" MAURICE SENDAK.
WELL THE REAL SAD THING IS, MR.
SENDAK DIED THIS MORNING AT AGE 83.
I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE INTERVIEWED HIM EARLIER THIS YEAR, AND TONIGHT WE'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
JUST A FEW MORE THINGS MAURICE HAD TO SAY.
THANKS FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME TODAY.
THIS SAY REAL HONOR.
>> NO SHIT.
>> STEPHEN: NO I'M NOT SHITTING YOU I MEAN IT.
WHAT YOUR FAVORITE OF YOUR OWN BOOKS.
>> I WISHED YOU WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION.
>> STEPHEN: GLAD I DID THEN.
>> I THINK THE BEST IS TWO BOOKS I'VE DONE.
I CAN HAVE TWO FAVORITES.
>> STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT.
>> ONE IS CALLED OUTSIDE OVER THERE.
>> STEPHEN: TERRIFYING.
>> MY ATTEMPT TO DO A BOOK --
>> STEPHEN: IT'S GOBLINS THAT MAKE ICE BABIES AND REPLACE A CHILD WIT.
>> WHAT CAN I SAY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS VERY DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH ROMANTIC ART OF THE BEGINNING OF THE 18th CENTURY, MIDDLE OF
THE 18th CENTURY.
MOT -- MOZART WAS DEAD AND THIS BEAUTIFUL THING CAME OUT OF HIS GENERATION.
MOZART BEING THE BEST QUALITY, BEST ARTIST, THE BEST EVERYTHING.
>> STEPHEN: HE'S LIKE THE DONALD TRUMP OF CLASSICAL MUSIC.
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO KILL YOU.
>> STEPHEN: EVERYTHING HE DOES IS GOLD PLATED THAT'S QUALITY.
>> DONALD TRUMP.
YOU NAILED HIM.
THERE'S ANOTHER CALLED HIGGLEY PIGGELY POP.
IT'S ABOUT A TERRIER, MY DOG I HAD.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
>> HIS NAME WAS JETTE AND SHE APPEARED IN ALL MY BOOKS UNTIL THE TIME SHE DIED.
IT WAS THE BIG BOOK I WROTE ABOUT HER BECAUSE I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO DIE SOON.
SHE WAS GETTING OLD.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT HAPPENS IN IT?
>> WHAT HAPPENS IN SIT A LITTLE DOG GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD AND LEAVES HER MASTER TO FIND OUT IS
THERE MORE TO LIFE.
THE SERIES OF ADVENTURES SHE HAS WHEN SHE PROVES HER TOTAL INADEQUACY TO ALMOST EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS TO HER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT SHE ACCEPTS THAT.
THAT'S THE TRUTH OF HER LIFE.
SHE MUST ACCEPT HER INADEQUACY AND FAILURE TO LIFE UP TO EXPECTATIONS THAT OTHERS HAVE
OVER AND SHE SURELY HAS AND SHE ENDS UP A SWEET DOG WHICH SHE IS.
NO ONE WANTED ANYTHING MORE FROM HER.
>> STEPHEN: DID SHE RETURN TO HIM?
>> NO, SHE DIED.
AND SHE LEAVES HIM A LETTER SAYING IF YOU EVER COME THIS WAY, LOOK ME UP BUT I CAN'T TELL
YOU HOW TO GET HERE.
THE BOOK HAS HAD A VERY DIFFICULT LIFE ALL OF IT.
WHAT IS IT A CHILDREN'S BOOK?
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
I'M FAMOUS FOR THEM.
I WRITE THEM.
I ILLUSTRATE THEM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.
I DON'T THEY WHY THEY ARE FOR CHILDREN.
>> STEPHEN: I LIKE THAT YOUR WORK DOES NOT SUGAR COAT CHILDHOOD.
I BRING THE PAIN, YOU KEEP IT REAL.
>> SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN TO SUFFER PAIN, READ ABOUT IT,
THINK ABOUT IT, FEEL ABOUT IT.
YET THAT'S ALL THEY DO.
>> STEPHEN: EVERY MOMENT OF CHILDHOOD IS UNCERTAINTY.
>> I THINK CHILDHOOD SAY PERIOD OF GREAT TORMENT WHERE YOU LEARN ALL THESE THINGS WHAT IS OR WHAT ISN'T?
WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO.
IT'S VERY HARD.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS THE BEST THING A PARENT CAN DO FOR A CHILD?
>> LOVE HIM/HER.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> TAKE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE.
>> STEPHEN: FOR OF THOSE YOU WHO DON'T KNOW HUSBAND WORK, READ HIS BOOKS.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T READ, THEY'VE GOT LOTS OF PICTURES.
I'M A BIT OF AN ARTIST I'LL SEE IF I CAN DO A QUICK PORTRAIT.
HOLD STILL.
>> YOU WANT A PROFILE OR THREE QUARTER.
>> STEPHEN: CLOSER TO ME LIKE THIS.
DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE BOOK OR ANYTHING?
>> MOBY DICK.
>> STEPHEN: MOBY DICK.
>> MOBY DICK.
>> STEPHEN: AND YOU ALWAYS WEAR YOUR GLASSES?
>> YES.
>> STEPHEN: BIG SPORTS FAN ARE YOU?
>> NO.
>> STEPHEN: WE'LL SAY BASKETBALL.
