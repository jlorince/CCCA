>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A
SECRET, I LOVE HELPING SENIORS.
THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO SET ASIDE
SPECIAL TIME ON MY SHOW FOR THEM
AND LIKE PHONECALLS TO MY NANA,
I ONLY DO IT TWICE A YEAR.
THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S SENIOR
MOMENT.
♪ ♪
FOLKS, WE ALL KNOW THAT POT
SMOKING IS A MENACE AND NOT JUST
TO OUR NATION'S DWINDLING SUPPLY
OF EL FUDGE COOKIES.
BUT LOOK WHO IS OKAY TING NOW.
>> PRETTY MUCH THE LAST PLACE
YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FIND
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SMOKE POT BUT
SENIORS LIVING AT THE LAGUNA
WOODS RETIREMENT COMMUNITY ALSO
KNOWN AS LEISURE WORLD HAVE
FORMED A NONPROFIT MEDICAL
MARIJUANA COLLECTIVE.
>> THE THOUGHT OF NAUSEA
DISAPPEARS AND IT'S REPLACED BY
WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED THE
MUNCHIES.
>> Stephen: OUR ELDERLY ARE
GETTING BAKED.
NO WONDER THEY ARE EATING DINNER
AT 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, WE CANNOT HAVE THE
GREATEST GENERATION BURNING
DOWN.
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THEY'LL BE
CROCHETING BLACK LIGHT PILLOW
AND TRYING TO SYNC UP PERRY C
CUOMO'S LIGHTLY LATIN.
SOON THEY'LL MOVE ON TO MEJ AND
IN ONE WILL KNOW BECAUSE THEY
HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR TEETH.
FOLKS, AS ALWAYS I'M MOSTLY
WORRIED ABOUT HOW THIS WILL
EFFECT ME.
BECAUSE AS REGULAR VIEWERS KNOW
I'M A FRIEND OF FACTOR AND FORM
ER OATMEAL SPOKESPERSON
WILFORD BRIMLEY.
HE IS MY MENTOR.
I RECEIVED A DISTURBING
PHONECALL.
SINCE RECORD ALL OF MY CALLS --
IT'S FOR THE LAWSUIT -- I CAN
PLAY IT FOR YOU NOW.
JIM?
>> HELLO?
>> HEY, COLLEGE.
>> Stephen: WILFORD?
>> IT'S WILFORD BRIMLEY.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU OKAY?
>> I'M AS FRIED AS A CHURRO.
HAD SOME OF THAT MARIJUANA.
IT'S PRESCRIPTION.
IT'S FOR MY DIABETES.
DIABETES.
DIABETES.
DIA-A-BETES.
YOU EVER SAY A WORD SO MANY
TIMES IT LOSES ALL MEANING.
>> Stephen: I HAVE TO WORK
TOMORROW.
>> I WON'T TAKE ANY MORE OF YOUR
TIME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK GOES UP INSIDE
A DISH WASHER.
I'M THINKING ABOUT CRAWLING UP
IN THERE.
>> Stephen: DON'T.
SHOULD I SEND SOMEONE OVER
THERE?
>> NOT UNLESS THEY WANT TO SEE A
76-YEAR-OLD MAN EATING OATMEAL
IN THE BUFF.
THE GUY IN THE OATMEAL BOX IS
LOOK AT ME.
>> Stephen: I'M HANGING UP.
>> COLBERT, WAIT.
>> Stephen: YES?
>> I LOVE YOU.
>> Stephen: THANKS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO -- WHAT IS
THAT NOISE.
>> (bleep).
I GOTTA GO.
I PUT A DVD IN MY TOASTER OVEN
TO REWIND IT AND NOW THE
BREAKFAST NOOK IS ON FIRE.
WHERE IS THE EXTINGUISHER?
PUT IT OUT WITH OATMEAL.
NOW THE OATMEAL IS ON FIRE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: KIDS, LISTEN TO
YOUR ELDERS, THEY ARE A FONT OF
WISDOM.
AND ELDERS, LAY OFF THE D
