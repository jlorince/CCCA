[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: BOOM!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT BEGUN EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THESE PEOPLE?
GOOD FOR YOU.
SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS -- FOLKS -- WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT.
PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO GET TO IT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I UNDERSTAND THE EXCITEMENT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST IS DUSTIN HOFFMAN, DIRECTOR OF THE NEW MOVIE "QUINTET" ABOUT 4 RETIRED OPERA
STARS, AND IN HIS FILM DEBUT THEIR FRIEND BUDDY, WHO ACCOMPANIES THEM ON THE SPOONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FIRST, I'M STILL REELING FROM YESTERDAY'S INAUGURATION DISASTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FIRST OFF, WHERE WAS SECURITY?
THE SECRET SERVICE IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY, BUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A KISS, THEY WERE VICIOUSLY PHOTOBOMBED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ENJOY --
[ LAUGHTER ]
ENJOY GITMO, MALIA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT, THE LESS IMPRESSED I AM WITH OBAMA'S SPEECH.
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME.
IT'S EVERYONE ON FOX NEWS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THE PRESIDENT MADE THE CASE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT.
>> THIS SPEECH TODAY WAS AN ODE TO BIG GOVERNMENT.
IT WAS A HYMN TO BIG GOVERNMENT.
AT HIS HEART, I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST.
>> Stephen: YES, AT HIS HEART HE IS A SOCIALIST.
EVER NOTICE HOW IT SHARES THE BLOOD WITH ALL THE OTHER ORGANS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL SORRY, OBAMA, YOUR CLASS WARFARE ISN'T GOING TO WORK.
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SHAMWOW PITCHMAN STUART VARNEY KNOWS THE REASON WHY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> RICH PEOPLE, POWERFUL PEOPLE, IN AMERICA TODAY, ARE REVILED.
THEY'RE DISMISSED AS FAT CATS WHO DON'T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE.
WE JUST HATE 'EM-- RICH PEOPLE ARE EVIL.
YET, ALONG COMES THIS SHOW "DOWNTON ABBEY"-- RICH PEOPLE PROMINENTLY FEATURED AND THEY'RE
GENEROUS; THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE; THEY CREATE JOBS, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE; THEY'RE CLASSY; THEY'VE
GOT STYLE AND WE LOVE 'EM.
THAT SHOW IS WILDLY POPULAR, WHICH POSES A THREAT TO THE LEFT, DOESN'T IT?
>> Stephen: YES, IT DOES.
>> Stephen: YES, THE POPULARITY OF "DOWNTON ABBEY" PROVES THAT AMERICA LOVES RICH GUYS.
THE SAME WAY THE POPULARITY OF "BREAKING BAD" PROVES AMERICA LOVES METH DEALERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOD, IT WOULD BE SO GREAT TO WORK FOR A RICH ARISTOCRAT, LIKE THE FICTIONAL LORD GRANTHAM.
JUST ASK THE FICTIONAL NEWSMAN STEVE DOOCY.
>> HERE'S THE THING-- THE ENTIRE TOWN LOVES THE RICH GUY WHO LIVES IN THE ABBEY BECAUSE HE
PROVIDES THE JOBS.
HE LOOKS AFTER EVERYBODY.
HE PROVIDES FREE MEDICAL CARE FOR EVERYBODY.
WITHOUT HIM-- AND SPOILER ALERT, IT LOOKED LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO, HE WAS GOING TO LOSE THE JOINT--
WITHOUT HIM THE PLACE WOULD GO BELLY UP.
>> Stephen: YES, HE LOOKS AFTER EVERYBODY.
YES, EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON LORD GRANTHAM.
HE PAYS FOR THE MEDICAL CLINIC IN TOWN AND TWO WEEKS AGO, HE ALMOST LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE
HE INVESTED POORLY IN THE CANADIAN RAILROAD.
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW OUR SOCIETY SHOULD FUNCTION.
ONE RICH GUY FAILS, NOBODY GETS HEALTHCARE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE POINT IS HIS SPEECH WAS A SWING AND A MISS NOT JUST FOR WHAT HE DID SAY BUT FOR WHAT HE
DID NOT SAY.
>> IT WAS A VERY BIZARRE, DISORDERED PRIORITY OF WHAT OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS WERE.
WHERE WAS THE DEBT?
WHERE WAS THE DEFICIT?
WHERE WAS THE UNEMPLOYMENT?
WHERE WAS THE ISSUE POVERTY IN AMERICA, WHICH HAS INCREASED UNDER HIS WATCH?
WHERE'S THE HOPELESSNESS?
>> Stephen: YEAH, WHERE WAS THE HOPELESSNESS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANTS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN, WHO COULD FORGET FDR'S FAMOUS INAUGRUAL WHEN HE PROCLAIMED: "THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR
IS FEAR ITSELF, AND ALSO A SECOND DEPRESSION, RAMPANT STARVATION, AND MY GUT'S TELLING
ME EUROPE'S A TINDERBOX.
AH, WHAT'S THE POINT?
WE'RE ALL DOOMED!
I CAN'T WALK!
I CAN'T WALK!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
