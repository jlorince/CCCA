(LAUGHTER)
LIKE A CLOCK.
FOLKS, I BELIEVE IN SAYING
WHATEVER'S ON MY MIND RIGHT
AFTER IT'S BEEN PUT INTO THIS
LITTLE TELEPROMPTER UP HERE.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST UP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE
HOUSING MARKET IN THAT THERE IS
STILL A HOUSING MARKET.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> HOUSE FLIPPING IS BACK.
>> Stephen: HOUSE FLIPPING?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
>> I'M NOT KIDDING.
HOUSE TIPPING.
REALTY TRACK SAYS THESE ARE THE
BEST PLACES TO FLIP A HOUSE.
NUMBER ONE: ORLANDO, ALSO ON THE
LIST, LAS VEGAS, PHOENIX, TAMPA.
SEE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR?
THESE STATES AND CITIES TOPPED
THE LIST OF THE FORECLOSURE
CRISIS.
>> THEY WERE GOBBLED UP BY HEDGE
FUNDS AND NOW THE HEDGE FUNDS
ARE NOW RENTING BACK TO THE
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY
HOMES.
>> NATION, THIS IS THE FREE
MARKET AT ITS BEST.
BANKS OVERLEND TO HOMEOWNERS AND
THEN FORECLOSE ON THEM THEN RENT
THEM BACK THEIR FORMER HOMES.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
IT'S LIKE BEING A METH DEALER
WHO IS ALSO A DENTIST.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH REMINDS ME I NEED TO GET A
CHECK UP WITH SPIDER.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP
OF MY HAT TO WALL STREET FOR
THIS GREAT MONEY-MAKING
INNOVATION.
BUT SADLY NOT EVERYONE'S ON
BOARD.
LIKE ONE CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE
AGENT WHO WORRIED THE THINGS
THAT SCARES ME IS THE VALUES
GOING UP SO QUICKLY.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE AND
THAT'S WHAT'S SCARING ME.
IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN
(LAUGHS)
NO!
THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!
THE FIRST TIME WALL STREET
INVESTORS PUMPED MONEY INTO THE
REAL ESTATE MARKET CAUSING A
MASSIVE BUBBLE THAT LED TO AN
ECONOMIC CRISIS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
THIS TIME WALL STREET INVESTORS
ARE PUMPING MONEY INTO THE REAL
ESTATE MARKET CAUSING A MASSIVE
BUBBLE THAT WILL LEAD TO
PROSPERITY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, THOSE
WHO FORGET THE PAST ARE DOOMED
TO MAKE MAD DOLLARS!
(LAUGHTER)
NEXT AMERICA'S ROADS AREN'T WHAT
THEY USED TO BE AND I WOULD TELL
THE NATION'S HIGHWAYS MYSELF BUT
THEY'RE STILL UPSET SINCE
FINDING OUT THEY WERE ADOPTED.
(LAUGHTER)
AND SADLY -- I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND SADLY STATE GOVERNMENTS
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO
REPAIR THEM.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING THE NEXT
TIP OF MY HAT TO NORTH CAROLINA
FOR FINDING AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO
PAY FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION.
>> OWNERS OF HYBRIDS AND
ELECTRIC CARS IN NORTH CAROLINA
MAY BE HIT WITH HIGHER FEES
BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY THE SAME
AMOUNT OF GAS TAX AS DRIVERS OF
TRADITIONAL CARS.
>> THE PROPOSED STATE SENATE
BUDGET CALLS FOR AN INCREASE ON
TOP OF THE ANNUAL REGISTRATION
FEE.
>> THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL ON
THE TABLE NOW CALLS FOR $50
ADDED FOR HYBRID OWNERS, $100
TACKED ON FOR ANYONE WHO DRIVES
AN ELECTRIC CAR.
>> Stephen: THANK GOD!
I SAY IT'S HIGH TIME WE PUNISH
THE ECK COTKWAOEPS.
THEY SHOULD BE BUYING GASOLINE
WHEN THEY NEED IT OR NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO WITH
IT, SET FIRE TO A DENNY'S.
(LAUGHTER)
IN FACT, --
(APPLAUSE).
IN FACT, FOLKS, I THINK MAYBE
THIS IS JUST ME, I THINK NORTH
CAROLINA SHOULD GO AFTER ALL
FREELOADER TRANSPORTATION THAT
USES PUBLIC ROADS BUT DOESN'T
PAY INTO THE SYSTEM.
PEDESTRIANS SHOULD BE HIT WITH A
WALKING TAX.
(LAUGHTER)
BICYCLISTS SHOULD BE HIT WITH A
BIKE TAX.
AND UNICYCLISTS SHOULD JUST BE
HIT.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY STOP AT ROADS?
PLENTY OF PEOPLE MAKE LIFE-STYLE
CHOICES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT
STATE BUDGETS.
LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO QUIT
SMOKING.
THAT HAS CAUSED CIGARETTE TAX
REVENUE TO DECLINE, TAX WHICH IS
GO TO FUND CANCER RESEARCH!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU HEAR THAT?
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE FROM
LUNG CANCER BECAUSE YOU REFUSE
TO SMOKE!
(LAUGHTER)
THANKS FOR SPREADING YOUR
SECOND-HAND HEALTH YOU SELFISH
JERKS!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
