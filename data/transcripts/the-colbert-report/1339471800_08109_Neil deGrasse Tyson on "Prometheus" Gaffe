( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO!
WHOOO!
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
YOU'RE AWFULLY NICE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> BEAUTIFUL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD A GOOD WEEKEND.
I DID TOO.
I MYSELF SAW ITS BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE PROMETHEUS.
NOW DIRECTOR RIDLEY SCOTT'S PREQUEL TO ALIEN, OR GLADIATOR, I'M NOT SURE.
I HAVE SEEN EITHER ONE.
UNFORTUNATELY, PROMETHEUS WAS RUINED FOR ME BY ASTROPHYSICIST AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW NEIL DEGRASSE.
FIRST HE WRECKED TITANIC BY POINTING OUT THAT THE NIGHT SKY AT THE END WAS INACCURATE.
(LAUGHTER) HOW I CAN LOSE MYSELF IN JACK AND ROSE'S FINAL GOOD-BYE KNOWING THAT THE
PLEIADES WERE IN THE LONG CEDEREAL POSITION.
AND YESTERDAY, NEIL TWEETED THIS.
PROMETHEUS GOES 35 LIGHT-YEARS INTO SPACE BUT CHARLIZE THERON GAFFEES WERE
HALF A BILLION MILES FROM EARTH.
YES.
35 LIGHT-YEARS WOULD PLACE THE CREW 205 TRILLION MILES AWAY FROM EARTH, NOT HALF A
BILLION WHICH NEIL POINTS OUT WOULD PUT THEM ONLY JUST PAST JUPITER.
OKAY, MR. BIG SHOT ASTRONOMER.
WE GET IT.
YOU HAVE A GPS.
YOU KNOW WHERE ALL THE GAS STATIONS ARE BETWEEN HERE AND ALPHA CENTARE.
BUT NATION, I'M NOT JUST ANNOYED, I'M ALSO TERRIFIED.
BECAUSE IF NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON POINTS OUT EVERYTHING INACCURATE IN MOVIES AND
THIS WAS THE ONLY MISTAKE HE FOUND, THAT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING, EVERYTHING ELSE
IN PROMETHEUS IS TRUE.
THE XENOMORPHS ARE COMING FOR US.
OH MY GOD, CHARLIZE THERON WAS HERE LAST WEEK AND I SHOOK HER HAND.
I'M INFECTED!
OH, OH, OH!
KILL ME!
OH, WHAT'S THIS.
WHAT'S THIS COMING OUT OF ME.
IT'S JUST MY BELLY.
IT'S JUST MY-- I HAD-- OH.
>>  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HAD WINGS FOR LUNCH.
STILL, NEIL, AS A FRIEND, DO ME A FAVOR, AND DON'T GO SEE MADAGASCAR 3.
I DON'T WANT TO FIND
