>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, AS A NEWS MAN, IT IS MY
DUTY TO KEEP YOU INFORMED, BY
WHICH I MEAN TERRIFIED.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU'RE NOT STOCKPILING
AMMUNITION, LEARNING MANDARIN
CHINESE AND COOKING SQUIRREL,
THEN I'M NOT DOING MY JOB.
MMM.
MANDARIN SQUIRREL.
THAT'S WHY THE THREATDOWN IS
SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY
SHOW.
SO IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT
I ISSUE A RARE THREAT
STAND-DOWN.
YOU MAY RECALL THAT ABOUT TWO
WEEKS AGO I ISSUED A MONKEY
THREAT.
NOW, YES, WE WERE ON VACATION
TWO WEEKS AGO, BUT PREMIUM
MEMBERS RECEIVED THE WARNING VIA
MY PATENTED THREAT CHOKER.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
WHEN I ISSUE A THREAT, THE
COLLAR CONSTRICT, ALERTING YOU
TO RUN TO A MIRROR TO READ OFF
THE NECK TICKER WHAT TO BE
AFRAID OF NEXT.
WELL, FOLKS, YOU CAN COME OUT OF
YOUR PANIC ROOMS BECAUSE IT
COMES OUT THAT CONTRARY TO
CREDIBLE MEDIA REPORTS, THE
TALIBAN ARE PROBABLY NOT
TRAINING MONKEY TERRORISTS.
[LAUGHTER]
I ONLY WARNED YOU BECAUSE THE
STORY WAS GIVEN TO ME BY THE
HIGHER PRIMATES OVER AT FOX AND
FRIENDS.
JIM.
>> THE CHINESE NEWS PUBLICATION
REPORTING NOW THAT THE TALIBAN
IS TRAINING MONKEYS TO SHOOT AND
KILL AMERICAN SOLDIERS.
AS AN INCENTIVE, THE MONKEYS ARE
TRAINED USING BANANAS AND
PEANUTS.
>> Stephen: CRACK REPORTING,
GRETCHEN.
I'M SURE YOUR PRODUCERS WILL
REWARD YOU, PREFERABLELY WITH
BANANAS AND PEANUTS.
AND THINK OF WHAT AN ADVANTAGE
THEY HAVE IN THE LUSH JUNGLES OF
AFGHANISTAN.
BUT NATION, I AM SAD TO SAY FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN HOURS FOX NEWS
GOT SOMETHING WRONG.
BECAUSE YOU SEE, THE
PRIMATOLOGIST HAS CONCLUDED THE
NOTION OF MONKEYS OPERATING
COMPLEX WEAPONS IS PURELY
FANTASTICAL BECAUSE MONKEYS CAN
ONLY BE TRAINED TO DO THINGS
LIKE TURN OFF LIGHTS AND OPEN
FAUCETS, SO WE'RE SAFE.
WE CAN ASSURED THAT THE MONKEY
SKILL SET TALKS OUT AT SMOKING,
RIDING DOGS, WASHING CATS,
ROLLER SKATING, ICE DANCING,
MAKING UDON NOODLES, MOTOCROSS,
KARATE AND COMPUTER HACKING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOR NOW MURDERING WITH ADVANCED
WEAPONRY IS STILL ALL OURS.
SO FOR DISMISSING THE THREAT OF
MONKEY TERRORISM, I BELIEVE
PROFESSOR MASON DESERVES SOME
CREDIT.
