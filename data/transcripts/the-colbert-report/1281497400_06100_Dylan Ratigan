MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
OUTSPOKEN HOST OF "THE DYLAN
RATIGAN SHOW."
I CAN'T WAIT THE FIND OUT WHO IT
IS.
PLEASE WELCOME DYLAN RATIGAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEART ATTACK DYLAN.
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> Stephen: NO NEED TO GET UP.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU
TOO.
AGAIN.
>> WELL, NO.
>> Stephen: WE'VE NEVER MET.
NOW, SIR, YOU ARE, AS I SAID,
THE OUTSPOKEN HOST OF "THE DYLAN
RATIGAN SHOW."
YOU WERE ON MY SHOW WITHOUT A
TIE.
>> UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: THAT DOES NOT
INSULT ME.
WHAT INSULTS ME IS THAT YOU
DIDN'T THINK IT NECESSARY TO
WEAR SOCKS.
[LAUGHTER]
JIM, CAN WE GET A SHOT OF HIS
FEET PLEASE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> TOUGH TIMES.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY DO AT MSNBC, BUT WE HAVE
STANDARDS OF DECORUM HERE.
DID YOU JUST LEAVE YOUR DOJO?
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE SOCKS ON?
>> TOUGH TIMES, TOUGH TIMES.
>> Stephen: NOTHING'S BETTER
ON A HOT DAY THAN BARE FEET
INNER LOAFERS.
NOW, YOU'RE AT MSNBC.
ARE YOU THE GUYS WHO GETS THE
FACTS TALKING POINTS FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE EVERY DAY, OR DOES
THAT GO STRAIGHT TO RACHELLING?
COME ON, YOU GUYS ARE A CLEARING
HOUSE FOR LIBERAL IDEAS.
BUSTED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> AT THIS POINT, IF YOU BELIEVE
THAT INDICTING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION AND THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALONG WITH THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THEIR
CONTINUED COMPLICIT
PARTICIPATION IN TAKING MONEY
FROM THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO
CONTROL OUR GOVERNMENT IN LIEU
OF HAVING TO WORK, BOTH THE
DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS,
WHETHER THEY'RE TRYING TO
PROTECT THEIR BANK GAMBLING
BUSINESS, WHETHER THEY'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT THEIR OUTSOURCING OF
MANUFACTURING TO CHINESE SLAVES
WHO MAKE 20 CENTS AN HOUR, I
HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A VERY HARD
TIME FIGURING OUT WHETHER ONE
PARTY IS ANY MORE AGAINST THOSE
THINGS THAN ANOTHER.
SO I ACTUALLY TAKE ISSUE WITH
YOUR SUGGESTION.
>> Stephen: I GUESS IN THE
MIDDLE OF ALL THAT YOU DO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARE YOU... DO YOU CONSTANTLY
SHOW CONTEMPT FOR THE PEOPLE YOU
USED TO WORK WITH, THE PEOPLE ON
WALL STREET?
YOU USED TO BE ON "FAST MONEY"
ON CNBC.
OKAY.
>> I WAS HOPING YOU...
>> Stephen: THAT WAS A GREAT
SHOW.
AND IT WAS AN HONEST SHOW
BECAUSE THE MONEY WAS VERY FAST.
>> IT WAS VERY FAST.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT IT AND IT
LEFT QUICKLY.
>> IT WAS GONE.
>> Stephen: SO WHY DID YOU
LEAVE THE WORLD OF WALL STREET
AND BEING A CHEERLEADER FOR WALL
STREET TO GO OVER TO THE OTHER
SIDE?
>> SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW I WANT TO
SPECULATE OR GAMBLE WITH MY
MONEY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS
OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO SPECULATE
OR GAMBLE WITH YOUR MONEY IN THE
FINANCIAL MARKETS.
AND I QUITE HONESTLY VERY MUCH
ENJOYED THE CONVERSATION,
ENJOYED HOSTING THAT PROGRAM.
I ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE
TRADERS AND THOSE IN THAT
ENVIRONMENT WHO WERE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT HOW THE INVEST THE
MONEY.
AND THEN WE'RE ALL SITTING THERE
IN 2008, AND WE WATCH, IT'S MY
MOTHER'S MONEY THEY'RE GAMBLING
WITH IN EFFECT.
>> Stephen: WAIT, IT OCCURRED
TO YOU IN 2008 THAT PEOPLE WERE
WATCHING YOU ON THAT LITTLE BOX
OVER THERE, THIS LITTLE THING?
OH, MY GOD, WIRES COME OUT OF IT
AND PEOPLE DO THINGS BASED ON MY
ADVICE.
[APPLAUSE]
DID YOU EAT PAINT CHIPS AS A
CHILD?
>> NO, NO.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE DOING THE
RIGHT THING.
THOSE PEOPLE WATCHING YOUR SHOW
WERE TAKING A CALCULATED RISK
WITH THEIR MUST BE.
>> -- THEIR MONEY.
>> BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE
REALITY THAT THAT WAS NOT THE
CASE, WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE
REALITY THAT THEY HAD PAID
THEMSELVES, THE BANK EXECUTIVES
HAD PAID THEMSELVES BILLIONINGS
OVER THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS...
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO
CRIMINALIZE SUCCESS.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: YOU WANT TO
CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE...
>> NO, STEALING.
>> Stephen: NO ONE HAS GONE TO
JAIL, SIR.
NO ONE HAS GONE TO JAIL.
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.
>> TELL THAT TO THE MEXICAN DRUG
DEALER.
>> Stephen: WHO YOU WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU WANT TO STOP THE REPUBLICANS
FROM REPEALING THE 14th
AMENDMENT.
TRUE OR FALSE?
>> TRUE.
>> Stephen: CHECKMATE.
CHECKMATE.
YOU JUST KNOCKED OVER YOUR KING.
>> BUT LISTEN, HERE'S WHY: IF I
HAD THE MEXICAN DRUG DEALERS IN
COUNTRY WHERE WE COULD GET
HANDLE ON THEM.
>> Stephen: YES?
>> I WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO DRAW
MORE CLEARLY THE PARALLELS
BETWEEN THOSE MEXICAN DRUG
DEALERS AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO
ARE RUNNING OUR BANKS, AND THAT
THE BENEFITS THE MEXICAN DRUG
DEALERS GET BY BUYING OFF THE
GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW THEM TO BE
LEGAL IN THEIR OPERATION IN
MEXICO IS THE EXACT SAME
MECHANISM THAT OUR BANK
EXECUTIVES USE IN GIVING MONEY
TO OUR POLITICIANS TO ENSURE
THAT THEY CAN GAMBLE, KEEP WHAT
THEY MAKE AND TRANSFER WHAT THEY
LOSE TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN
YOUR AUDIENCE, TO MY MOTHER, TO
YOUR CHILDREN, AND TO PEOPLE WHO
NEVER CHOSE TO MAKE AN
INVESTMENT OF ANY KIND AS LONG
AS THEY LIVED BUT WERE PUT ON
THE HOOK FOR THAT REASON.
>> Stephen: WELL, OKAY.
>> THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I WASN'T ABLE TO
FOLLOW MOST OF THAT.
SO WE'RE GOING TO EDIT IT OUT IN
THE FINAL THING.
>> YOUR SHOW, YOUR SHOW.
>> Stephen: SO IT LOOKS LIKE I
WON.
OKAY.
FINE.
YOU SOMETIMES USE A CHALKBOARD.
>> FROM TIME TO TIME.
>> Stephen: YOU DO.
GLENN BECK FAMOUSLY USES A
CHALKBOARD.
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR
OWN BASIC FORM OF CHILDISH
COMMUNICATION?
SHOULDN'T YOU USE LIGHT BRIGHT?
FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULD EAT UP A
LOT OF SHOW TIME TO HAVE TO PUT
THOSE LITTLE PEGS IN THERE.
>> BUT IF IT WORKS, FORGET
WHAT'S ON THE CHALKBOARD, WOULD
YOU TELL THE MATH TEACHER THAT
THE ENGLISH TEACHER CAN'T USE A
CHALKBOARD?
>> Stephen: YES, I WOULD.
>> WOULD YOU TELL ONE CARPENTER
WHO IS USING A HAMMER THAT THE
OTHER CARPENTER CAN'T USE A
HAMMER?
>> Stephen: IN THE SECOND
CARPENTER IS A MENTION --
MEXICAN?
>> I'M WITH YOU ON THA
