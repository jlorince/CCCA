EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS THE FOURTH
MAN TO WALK ON THE MOON.
BUT THE FIRST TO SKIP.
PLEASE WELCOME ARTIST AND
ASTRONAUT ALAN BEAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MR. BEAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
TREMENDOUS HONOR TO MEET YOU,
SIR.
>> MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU FOR COMING
ON.
NOW, SIR, YOU ARE ONE OF ONLY 12
MEN WHO HAVE WALKED ON THE MOON.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M TRYING TO THINK IF I CAN ASK
YOU A QUESTION YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ASKED BEFORE.
BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK WHAT IT'S
LIKE BECAUSE THAT'S FIRST
QUESTION YOU'RE ALWAYS ASKED,
RIGHT?
>> OFTEN IT IS.
>> STEPHEN: I'LL ASK YOU THIS:
IF YOU COULD IMPROVE THE MOON IN
THREE WAY, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
>> FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE CHEDDAR
CHEESE, SO I WOULD CHANGE IT TO
CHEDDAR.
>> STEPHEN: OKAY.
>> I'D MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT
CLOSER TO THE EARTH BECAUSE IT'S
240,000 MILES AWAY, AND WHEN I
WAS THERE, I KEPT THINKING, THIS
IS A LONG WAY TO GO BACK HOME.
I HOPE THIS WORKS.
>> STEPHEN: I'M SURE THE CELL
RECEPTION WAS TERRIBLE.
NO BARS.
>> I'D PUT IT UP A COUPLE
HUNDRED MILES.
IT WOULD LIGHT UP THE NICE.
>> STEPHEN: BEAUTIFUL.
NICE IDEA.
NOW, YOU RETURNED TO EARTH AND A
FEW YEARS AFTER GETTING BACK YOU
GOT OUT OF THE ASTRONAUT GAME
AND BECAME AN ARTIST.
>> YES.
IT WAS MY HOBBY BEFORE I BECAME
AN ASTRONAUT.
>> STEPHEN: SO YOU COULD PAINT
BEFORE YOU WENT?
>> NOT VERY WELL, BUT I SAID...
>> STEPHEN: THEN YOU WERE HIT
WITH COSMIC RAYS AND IT GAVE YOU
A SUPERPOWER?
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> STEPHEN: I'M TRYING TO MAKE
THIS A GOOD STORY.
>> I WISH WE COULD DO IT.
IT'S HARD WORK LIKE ANYTHING
ELSE.
YOU HAVE TO STUDY, PRACTICE,
MAKE MISTAKES, STUDY, PRACTICE,
MAKE MISTAKES.
I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ONE
OF THE 12 TO GET TO THE MOON.
I NEED THE LEAVE SOME OF THE
STORIES BEHIND AFTER WE'RE ALL
GONE.
I'M 78 NOW.
ALL THE OTHER ASTRONAUTS THAT
WALKED ON THE MOON ARE ABOUT THE
SAME.
WE'LL BE GONE SOON.
AND I SAID, I'M GOING TO LEAVE
SOME OF THE STORIES BEHIND THAT
REGULAR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
>> STEPHEN: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
DOING ART WHO WENT TO THE MOON?
>> NO.
IN FACT, IF MY BOSS KNEW I WAS
AN ARTIST, I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
TAKEN AS AN ASTRONAUT.
>> STEPHEN: LET'S LOOK AT SOME
OF THE ART HERE.
THIS FIRST PAINTING HERE I
PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS.
IS MY FAVORITE PAINTING THAT WE
GOT FROM YOU.
THIS IS CALLED LUNAR HIGH-FIVE
FIRST MISSION AN IMAGINED LEAP
OF CELEBRATION AND IT DEPICTS
TWO ASTRONAUT HIGH-FIVING WITH
THE EARTH IN BACKGROUND AND THE
AMERICAN FLAG.
>> THAT'S HOW WE FELT ALL THE
TIME.
>> STEPHEN: CAN I SUGGEST
ANOTHER TITLE?
>> SURE.
>> STEPHEN: THE MOST AWESOME
PAINTING IN THE HISTORY OF
ANYTHING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LET'S GO TO ONE OF THE OTHERS
HERE, JIM.
NOW, IS THIS... THAT IS YOU?
WHAT IS THIS CALLED?
>> THE WORLD AT MY FINGERTIPS.
THIS IS ME.
I REACHED MY HAND UP AND PUT MY
GLOVED THINGERS AROUND THE
EARTH.
THAT'S THE EARTH IN THE
BACKGROUND, 240,000 MILES AWAY.
YOU CAN SEE MY CHECKLIST.
THERE I REPAINTED IT THERE.
>> STEPHEN: THE CHECKLIST IS
"IMMORTALIZE THIS AS A
PAINTING."
>> MAYBE IT WAS THERE.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT MEDIUM?
>> I DO ACRYLICS.
CAN YOU SEE THOSE BOOT PRINTS?
>> STEPHEN: I CAN.
>> I LOVE TEXTURING PAINTINGS.
I DID IT LIKE REGULAR EARTH
ARTISTS.
I SAID, WHY AM I USING THOSE
TOOLS.
I CAN USE MY MOON TOOLS.
>> STEPHEN: ARE THESE THE MOON
BOOTS ON THE MOON?
>> NO, JUST LIKE IT.
WE LEFT THE MOON BOOTS ON THE
MOON BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO LEAVE
THAT WEIGHT THERE AND BRING
EQUIVALENT WEIGHT OF ROCKS BACK.
>> STEPHEN: YOU HAD THE LEAVE
YOUR MOON BOOTS THERE.
>> WE HAD TO LEAVE THEM.
>> STEPHEN: THE MOON IS LIKE A
BOWLING ALLEY.
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE... NOT NEARLY
AS ROMANTIC AS I THOUGHT.
YOU USE A VERY SPECIAL MEDIUM
YOU SOMETIMES MIX INTO YOUR
PAINTS.
TELL PEOPLE WHAT THAT IS?
>> I DO.
I WANTED TO HAVE MOON DUST IN MY
PAINTINGS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE FUN.
THAT'S ONE NICE THING.
>> STEPHEN: WHERE DID YOU GET
THE MOON DUST.
>> NASA DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME,
BUT THEY GAVE ME THE AMERICAN
FLAG FROM MY SUIT, MY APOLLO 12,
NASA EMBLEM, NAME TAG.
THEY'RE DIRTY.
I SAID ONE DAY, BOY, THOSE ARE
DIRTY.
I BETTER CLEAN THEM.
THEY'RE DIRTY WITH MOON DUST OF
THE OCEAN OF STORMS.
IF I'M WILLING TO CUT 'EM UP AND
PUT THEM IN THE PAINTINGS, THEN
I'LL HAVE MOON DUST IN THERE.
SO THAT'S WHAT I DO NOW.
IN FACT, MY AMERICAN FLAG IS A
LITTLE LESS THAN ONE-THIRD NOW
AS I'VE USED IT UP THROUGH THE
YEARS, BUT IT'S THE FIRST
PAINTINGS I'VE EVER SEEN WHERE
PEOPLE DID SOMETHING, ARTISTS
DID SOMETHING.
>> STEPHEN: I THINK THAT'S
FANTASTIC.
I WILL CERTAINLY TESTIFY...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I WILL CERTAINLY TESTIFY ON YOUR
BEHALF WHEN YOU ARE ARRESTED FOR
CUTTING UP AN AMERICAN FLAG.
>> OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STEPHEN: ASTRONAUT AND ARTIST
ALAN BEAN.
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU, SIR.
