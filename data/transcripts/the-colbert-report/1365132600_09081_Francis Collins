[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WE WILL WELCOME
BACK, EVERYBODY.
-- WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WANTS TO MAP
THE HUMAN BRAIN.
OR AS IT'S ALSO KNOWN: A MENU
FOR ZOMBIES.
PLEASE WELCOME DR. FRANCIS
COLLINS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN DR.
COLLINS.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE IS.
>> Stephen: FOURTH TRIP BACK
TO THE SHOW.
I LOVE FINDING OUT WHAWR DOING
AT THE N.I.H.
>> A LOT OF STUFF, MAN.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE THE
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INSTITUTES
OF HEALTH.
YOU LED THE GOVERNMENT EFFORT TO
MAP THE HUMAN GENOME.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: TUESDAY PRESIDENT
OBAMA ANNOUNCED THE BRAIN
INITIATIVE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO MAP THE HUMAN BRAIN?
AM I RIGHT?
IS THIS ABOUT MIND CONTROL?
>> HOW DID I KNOW YOU WERE GOING
TO GO THERE?
ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT THIS AMAZING
STUR, THE HUMAN BRAIN.
>> Stephen: I THOUGHT IT WAS A
NERF FOOTBALL FOR A SECOND.
>> IT'S NOT A REAL BRAIN JUST TO
BE CLEAR.
IT IS IN THESE THREE POUNDS OF
MATERIAL THE MOST COMPLICATED
BIOLOGICAL STRUCTURE IN THE
UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: ARE THEY ALL
RAINBOW FLAGS?
>> NO, THIS IS JUST A TEACHING
MODEL.
>> Stephen: JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IF IT WAS A GI MARRIAGE THING.
GOOD HEAD.
THIS IS IN MANY WAYS THE ESSENCE
OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.
WE'RE VERY MUCH DETERMINED --
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WE'RE NOT DETERMINED.
NOT ME, MY GUT.
YOU KNOW THE GUT HAS MORE NERVE
ENDINGS IN IT THAN THE BRAIN
DOES.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
>> IT HAS A LOT BUT THERE ARE 76
BILLION NEURONS IN THIS
PARTICULAR BRAIN AND EACH ONE OF
THOSE MAKES ABOUT 1,000 OR MORE
CONNECTIONS.
IT'S AN AMAZINGLY COMPLEX
STRUCTURE.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE SAYING
THERE'S MORE NERVE ENDINGS IN
THE BRAIN THAN THE GUT?
>> I BELIEVE THERE ARE.
>> Stephen: WHO TOLD YOU THAT
YOUR BRAIN.
>> WELL, HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAP
THE BRAIN?
IS GOINGEL GOING TO DO THIS?
ARE THEY GOING TO DRIVE A TINY
CAR UP MY NOSE?
IS IT GOING TO HURT?
>> WE GO FROM A STATIC MAP OF
THE BRAIN, A WIRING DIEA GRAM,
NOT A VERY GOOD ONE AND FIGURE
OUT HOW THE WIRES WORK.
THINK ABOUT IF YOU WERE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW AN iPHONE
WORKED.
COULD YOU NOT TURN IT ON.
YOU COULD POP IT UP BUT YOU
WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW IT
REMEMBERS THINGS, DOES
CALCULATIONS STEERCHG ARE YOU
GOING TO POP OPEN MY HEAD WHILE
I'M THINKING WITH A CAN OPENER
AND TRACING PAPER?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> WE HAVE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
THAT DON'T REQUIRE POPPING YOUR
HEAD OWN BUT WE COULD HAVE A
LOOK INSIDE YOUR HEAD.
WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT THIS WOULD
LOOK LIKE.
>> Stephen: I PUT THIS ON.
>> YEAH, THE TAG GOES IN THE
BACK.
>> Stephen: TELL MY WIFE, I
LOVE HER.
TAG GOES IN THE BACK.
I KNOW HOW BRAIN WAVE HATS BEGUN
ON, SIR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE OF EARTH, I
COME IN PEACE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I'M GLAD TO SAY THAT DESPITE
WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE ARGUED
YOU DO HAVE BRAIN ACTIVITY, SIR.
>> PUT THIS BADBOY UP THERE,
WHAT IS GOING ON.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?
[LAUGHTER]
CAN I CONTROL.
CAN I BEND SPOONS WITH MY MIND
NOW?
WHAT IS ALL THIS UP HERE?
>> THOSE ARE ELECTRICAL IMPULSES
CREATED BY THE 86 BILLION
NEURONS IN YOUR HEAD BASICALLY
MAKING THE POINT THAT THE BRAIN
IS SOMETHING THAT OPERATES ON
THE LAWS OF PHYSICS.
IT HAS CURRENTS, CHEMISTRY.
>> Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE A
RICHTER SCALE.
IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE IN MY MIND.
>> MAYBE ON SOME OCCASIONS WE DO
HAVE EARTHQUAKES BUT THOSE WOULD
BE CALLED SEIZURES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S BAD STUFF.
AGAIN, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT
THE RIBBON IS RAINBOW COLORED.
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT THIS
TECHNOLOGY NEED HELPS -- THE
SEQUESTER HAS GOT IN OUR WAY.
>> Stephen: YES IT'S DUCT
TAPED TOGETHER.
IT'S VERY NICE.
CAN I TAKE THIS OFF OR WILL I
PASS OUT?
>> IT WOULD BE OKAY.
>> Stephen: AH.
THAT'S NIESMS AND LOOK AT
THIS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THAT'S NICE.
AND LOOK AT THIS DIDN'T MESS UP
A HAIR.
WHERE WOULD I STAB A PENCIL TO
GET "CALL ME MAYBE" OUT OF MY
HEAD?
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY WE NEED
THIS BRAIN INITIATIVE.
THEN I COULD ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION.
RIGHT NEW IT'S IN THERE
SOMEWHERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE
WIRING AND FUNCTIONALITIES
FIGURED OUT.
>> Stephen: CAN YOU MAYBE IT.
THERE'S THE STRUCTURE OF BRAIN.
THEN THERE'S THE INFLUENCE ON
THE BRAIFNL YOU ARE GIVEN PRY
YRTS IN THINKING.
YOU HAVE GIVEN THE DECISION TREE
OF YOUR LIFE AND THE IF THENS
ARE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY SINGLE
PERSON.
HOW CAN YOU MAP THAT ON ONE
PERSON AND HAVE IT MEAN
SOMETHING FOR ANYONE ELSE?
TNCHES A BRILLIANT QUESTION.
>> Stephen: I'M A BRILLIANT
MAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> SO ARE WE ALL.
THE FACT THAT WE COULD, IN FACT,
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE
DIFFERENCES IS WAY DOWN THE ROAD
SOMETHING WE MIGHT LEARN.
RIGHT NEW WE NEED KIND OF A
REFERENCE OF A NORMAL HUMAN
BRAIN IF THERE'S ONE WE COULD
CALL NORMAL.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR VOLUNTEERS.
>> YOU ARE EXCEPTIONAL.
>> Stephen: I'M JUST AN
AVERAGE JOE WHO CHANGES THE
WORLD WITH THOUGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW
THE IMPULSES WORK AT SPEED OF
THOUGHT.
IMAGINE THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE SPEED
OF THOUGHT?
>> IT'S WHAT HAPPENED
ELECTRICALLY BETWEEN THE 86
BILLION NEURONS WHEN INFORMATION
IS PASSED AROUND STEERCHGHTS
IT'S LIKE 50 MILES PER HOUR.
>> IT'S A LOT FASTER.
MICROSECONDS IS THE TRANSFER
BETWEEN NEURON TO NEURON.
THE WAY IN WHICH WE PERCEIVE
TIME.
>> Stephen: IF I COULD SPEED
UP MY BRAIN WOULD TIME SLOW
DOWN?
>> NO -- YEAH, I GUESS IT WOULD
ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: I JUST BLEW YOUR
MIND.
I JUST BLEW YOUR MIND, BUDDY.
>> I HAD TO THINK ABOUT THAT
ONE.
>> Stephen: THAT IS BRUCE LEE
STUFF.
>> YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE REALLY
DOING THIS?
BECAUSE THERE'S 100 MILLION
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO
SUFFER FROM BRAIN DISEASE.
BY BUILDING THE FOUNDATION OF
UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAIN
WORKS HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE
OF KNOWING WHAT TO DO FOR THEM.
FOR AUTISM, SCHIZOPHRENIA,
PARKINSON'S EPILEPSY.
FOR ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS
THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING IT.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE
PLEASURE CENTER OF THE BRAIN?
COULD YOU DROP A LITTLE
ELECTRICAL IMPULSE THERE AND
GIVE ME THE FEELING ALL THE TIME
THAT IT'S LIKE I'M A FRESHMAN IN
HIGH SCHOOL AND IT'S WINTERTIME
AND I'M ABOUT TO GET UP AND MY
MOM COMES IN AND IT'S A SNOW DAY
AND I GET TO SNUGGLE BACK
UNDERNEATH THE COVERS AND SHE
BRINGS ME TOMATO SOUP AND
GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES.
IF YOU COULD FIND THAT, HOOK A
220 LINE TO IT.
CRANK IT UP AND RIP OFF THE
NOBODY.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
>> I GET THAT.
THAT'S THAT'S THE --
>> Steve: WHAT IS ON THAT
FIRST?
>> WOODY ALLEN SAID THIS WAS HIS
SECOND FAVORITE ORGAN.
WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT PART IN
MIND, TOO.
>> Stephen: WELL, YOU CAN
ALREADY HOOK UP CABLES TO THE
OTHER ONE.
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DR. FRANCIS COLLINS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WON'T WE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
