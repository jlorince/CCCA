>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
NOW, FOLKS, AS PROMISED, THE
SPEED SKATING SHOWDOWN OF THE
CENTURY SHANI VERSUS STEPHEN:
FIRE ON ICE.
BUT NOT ACTUAL FIRE IT'S --
YOU'LL SEE.
JIM, JUST ROLL IT.
TONIGHT, A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN IN
THE CITY OF THE LAKE OF SALT
BETWEEN TWO FIERCE COMPETITORS
WHO HAVE LIVED EERILY PARALLEL
LIVES.
SHANI DAVIS SHOWED THE MAKINGS
OF A CHAMPION EVEN AS A YOUNG
BOY AND STEPHEN COLBERT WAS ALSO
ONCE A YOUNG BOY.
SHAN, A KHAOEFD GREATNESS ON THE
ICE THROUGH YEARS OF SACRIFICE,
STEPHEN STARTED TRAINING MORE
THAN TWO HOURS AGO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND AT THE 2006 OLYMPICS IN
TORINO, ITALY, SHANI DAVIS WAS
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN TO
WIN GOLD IN THE WINTER GAMES
WHILE AT THE VERY SAME TIME
STEPHEN COLBERT WAS WATCHING HIM
EATINGING A CHICKEN PARMESAN SUB
BALANCED ON HIS BELLY.
CLEARLY THESE TWO MEN WERE
DESTINED TO MEET.
DESTINY COMES TODAY ON A FROZEN
OVAL IN UTAH.
TO BEAT SHANI STEPHEN KNEW HE
WOULD NEED EVERY ADVANTAGE SO
FIRST HE GOT A CAPE BECAUSE WHAT
HE LACKED IN SPEED, DEDICATION
AND ATHLETIC ABILITY HE WAS
DETERMINED TO MAKE UP IN STYLE.
