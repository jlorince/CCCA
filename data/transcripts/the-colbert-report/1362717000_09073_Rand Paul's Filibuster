THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND OUT THERE AND A SPECIAL GOOD EVENING TO WHATEVER POOR STAFF IS DOWN
AT COMEDY CENTRAL AND LOGGING ALL THE LITTLE CLIPS FOR MY SHOW RIGHT NOW.
IT'S A HORRIBLE JOB.
GET OUT OF THERE.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
NATION, IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH THE NOISE OF WASHINGTON, D.C.
BUT LAST NIGHT NAME AN EPIC STAND ON THE SENATE FLOOR BY LIBERTARIAN SENATOR RAND PAUL.
>> TO WASHINGTON WE GO NOW WHERE A BIT OF A RARITY TAKING PLACE TODAY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR RAND
PAUL KENTUCKY RIGHT NOW FILIBUSTERING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CHOICE FOR C.I.A. DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN.
SENATOR PAUL SAID HE WILL TALK UNTIL HE NO LONGER CAN.
YOU TALK AND TALK TO PREVENT A VOTE.
>> Stephen: TALKING AND TALKING AND TALKING TO FILL HOURS OF EMPTY TIME.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S THE STORY CABLE NEWS WAS BORN TO COVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, SENATOR PAUL STARTED HIS FILIBUSTER IN RESPONSE TO THE ANSWER HE RECEIVED FROM ATTORNEY
GENERAL ERIC HOLDER TO THIS QUESTION:
>> CAN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CARRY OUT DRONE STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS ON U.S. SOIL?
>> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, ERIC HOLDER, HAS MADE A SURPRISING STATEMENT, YES BUT ONLY UNDER
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCESES.
>> Stephen: LIKE AN ENDLESS WAR WITH A FACELESS ENEMY FOUGHT BY REMOTE CONTROL FLYING KILLBOTS.
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?
[LAUGHTER]
THE FIRST QUESTION WAS AL QAEDA ENEMY COMBATANT.
OVER THE COURSE OF THE 13 STRAIGHT HOURS HE RAISED A SLIPPERY SLOPE QUESTION THE
ANSWER TO WHICH HE RECEIVED THIS AFTERNOON.
>> THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RESPONDED WITH A LETTER FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER TO RAND PAUL.
I'M QUOTING, IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION YOU'VE ASKED:  DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO USE AID WEAPONNIZED DRONE TO KILL AN AMERICAN NOT -- THE ANSWER IS NO.
>> THERE WAS ONE OF SHORTEST LETTERS FROM AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND IT HAD A SILENT FU IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
>> Stephen: F-U, OF COURSE STANDS FOR THANK YOU FOR IS ASKING.
I WANT TO THANK RAND PAUL FOR MAKING THIS BRAVE STANCE BECAUSE IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THEY CANNOT
KILL US.
I'M SURE THERE'S NOT CLASSIFIED LEGAL OPINION OVERRIDING THAT ONE LIKE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
DOESN'T CHANGE MY OPINION.
NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, I LOVE DRONES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DO YOU HEAR THAT DRONES?
STEPHEN LOVES YOU!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN, LOVES DRONES, DRONES,
