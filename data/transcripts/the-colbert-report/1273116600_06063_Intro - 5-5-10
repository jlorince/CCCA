>> Stephen: TONIGHT, MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK.
HIS BARK IS WORSE THAN HIS BITE,
BECAUSE HE WILL BARK YOUR THROAT OUT.
PLUS THERE'S AN ENEMY OF AMERICA IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD.
HOPEFULLY YOUR MEXICAN GARDENER WILL PROTECT YOU.
AND MY GUEST, DAVE ISAY HAS A NEW BOOK OF INTERVIEWS WITH AMERICA'S MOMS.
IT'S 300 PAGES OF "WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED?." BP HAS SHUT OFF ONE OF THE THREE
OIL LEAKS.
NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PREMIUM AND SUPER LEAKS.
