NATION, I AM SO FILLED WITH
"SYNONYM FOR ANGER" ABOUT "ISSUE
IN NATIONAL NEWS" I WAS SO
"DIFFERENT ANGER WORD" THAT I
BROKE MY "EXPENSIVE RICH-GUY
THING."
MORE EMOTION.
SHOUTING.
JIMMY, VIDEO CLIP.
WAIT A SECOND!
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
THE BLANKS ARE ALL EMPTY IN MY
TELEPROMPTER MADLIBS.
WHERE ARE MY WRITERS?
WRITEERS!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GUY, GUYS, THERE ARE NO THOUGHTS
IN HERE.
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING ALL
WEEKEND?
>> WE WERE IN LOS ANGELES.
WE WON AN EMMY FOR BEST WRITING
FOR A VARIETY SERIES.
>> Stephen: I DID?
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, WE ALL DID.
>> Stephen: I DID IT!
WOOO!
[CELEBRATORY MUSIC PLAYING] OH,
YES, OH, YES, I HAVE SUPPED ON
THE FLESH OF MINE ENEMIES AND
DRUNK THE HEAVY WINE OF VICTORY.
A LEGION OF ANGELS WILL ANOINTS
MY NAKED BODY WITH FRAGRANT
UNGUENTS, AND TONIGHT THERE
SHALL BE TACOS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW GO FINISH MY SCRIPTS.
GO!
GO, GO.
I SWEAR, THOSE ARE THE WORST
