>> FOLKS, I ENJOY FOOD.
THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD.
>> WE LIVE WHERE BIG GOVERNMENT
FOOD POLICE, THEY SPEND ALL OF
THEIR TIME COUNTING THE RAT
TURDS IN MY TORTILLA WHILE THE
RABBIT IS STILL OUT ON THE
STREET TURNING TRIX FOR KIDS!
>> IT IS DISGUSTING.
>> WELL NOW THE NANCE ANY STATE
BUZZ KILLERS OF THE FDA WANTS TO
TAKE AWAY ANOTHER FOODSTUFF
BECAUSE IT CONTAINS NEITHER FOOD
OR STUFF.
>> YOU GO TO RESTAURANTS THE FDA
PLANS TO BAN TRANS FAT FROM THE
FOOD I HAVE.
>> IT IS A INGREDIENT IN A LOT
OF OUR FAVORITE FOODS.
>> MICROWAVE POPCORN, COOKIES,
CAKES, FROZEN PIZZA, AND MUCH
MORE.
>> THE ONLY PERSON WHO STANDS UP
FOR TRANCE FATS, IF IT IS SO BAD
FOR YOU, WHY ARE THEY IN FOOD
AND I SUSPECT THE ANSWER IS THEY
ARE DELICIOUS.
>> WELL THAT MAY SOUND LIKES AN
IDIOTIC THING TO SAY BUT LET ME
BE THE ONLY PERSON STANDING UP
FOR TUCKER CARLSON, IF HE SAYS
STU, IF HE IS SO STUPID, WHY IS
HE ON FOX NEWS?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> FOLKS, HE IS NOT THE ONLY
PERSON STANDING UP FOR TRANS
FATS.
>> THEY ARE COMING AFTER YOUR
DOUGHNUTS, THEY ARE COMING AFTER
THE TRANS FAT IN YOUR DOUGHNUTS.
>> YES, THEY ARE COMING AFTER
OUR DOUGHNUTS, FOR PETE'S SAKES
THEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN AWAY THE
HOLES AND WHY?  ON THE FLIMSY
EXCUSE THAT TRANCE FATS ARE
PROVEN TO CAUSE HEART DISEASE
THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF ADULTS
IN AMERICA, OF THE ADULTS IN
AMERICA SO OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE
SAFE FOR CHILDREN.
>> FOLKS, YOU CAN HAVE MY TRANCE
FATS, YOU CAN HAVE MY TRANCE
FATS WHEN YOU SCRAPE THEM OUT OF
MY COLD DEAD HEART, OF COURSE WE
WON'T NOTICE IT IS GONE JUST
BECAUSE TRANCE FATS DON'T HAVE
ANY PARTICULAR TASTE.
NO PARTICULAR TASTE?  THAT IS
AMERICA'S FAVORITE FLAVOR.
>> YOU TRY LONG JOHN SILVER'S
BREADED!  STRIPS, THE CLOSEST I
CAN GET IS STRIP.
>> THE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT'S ATTACK ON OUR
GENTLEMAN DEZERO CRISCO VALUES
COMES FROM THE HERITAGE
FOUNDATION IN A RECENT ARTICLE
ENTITLED FDA'S PROPOSED TRANS
FAT BAN AN ATTACK ON FREEDOM.
THEY WRITE, QUOTE, A PERSON
DOESN'T EAT A CORN CHIP WITH
TRANS FAT AND THEN DIE, THE DOSE
MAKES THE POISON, EVEN IF THEY
EAT SO MUCH TRANS FAT THEY IN
FACT DO HAVE GREATER HEALTH
RISKS THIS IS THEIR PERSONAL AND
INFORMED CHOICE.
YES, THOSE WHO EAT TRANCE FATS
ARE MAKING AN INFORMED CHOICE.
JUST ASK THE AVERAGE JOE FILLING
HIS CART WITH FROZEN CINNAMON
BUNS HE WILL TELL YOU HE HAS A
HANKERING FOR ADDING A HYDROGEN
AT FAMILIAR TO A FATTY ACID
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DOUBLE
BONDS TO THE MAKES A MALLEABLE
MIXTURE OF FAT THAT CANNOT BE
METABOLIZING CAUSING DAMAGE TO
THE TISSUES.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AT LEAST
THAT IS WHAT I THINK HE IS
SAYING.
HIS MOUTH WAS FUDDLE OF UNCHEWED
BUN.
>> I HOPE THE NATIONAL HERITAGE
GETS IT RIGHT IF YOU DON'T DROP
DEAD AFTER EATING A CHIP IT
SHOULDN'T BE REGULATED LIKE IF
YOU DON'T IMMEDIATELY DIE FROM
INGEST AGO SMALL AMOUNT OF
FIBERGLASS IT IS TIME TO PUT IT
IN ALL OF OUR SNACKS.
>> I MEAN, THEY ALREADY SPRINKLE
IT ON HOSTESS SNOWBALLS.
>> NEXT UP, FOLKS I HAVE BEEN A
FAN OF MCDONALD'S, THEY ARE THE
KING OF BURGERS, WELL, FOLKS, I
AM EXCITED BECAUSE RECENTLY WE
GOT A BEHIND THE LOOK SCENES OF
ONE OF MCDONALD'S TREASURED MEAT
WITCHES.
>> THEY SAY IGNORANCE IS BLISS,
RIGHT, JOE.
>> AND THAT MAY APPLY TO THE
MCDONALD'S MCRIB SANDWICH.
A PHOTO OF, WAS TAKEN BY A
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE OF A --
>> OH, GOLL, SWEET JESUS.
IT WENT VIRAL.
>> IS THERE NO SHAME?
>> MCDONALD'S SAYS THE PATTY IS
FORMED IN THE SHAPE OF
TRADITIONAL RIBS, THEY FLASH
FREEZE THE MEAT BEFORE SENDING
IT OUT TO THE RESTAURANTS.
THAT IS GROSS.
>> Stephen: OR MAYBE YOU ARE
THE ONE THAT IS GROSS, MIKA,
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH A
MCRIB JUST BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO
BE MADE OUT OF SICKLY ET.
>> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FIRM
BELIEVER THAT THE BEST FOOD
RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT
ANSWERS.
IF ANYTHING, THIS PHOTO MAKES ME
WANT THIS THING EVEN MORE.
BECAUSE IT ONLY ADDS TO THE
GREAT AMERICAN MYSTERY THAT IS
THE MCRIB.
THE ELUSIVE MCRIB HAS APPEARED
AND DISAPPEARED ON MCMENUS WITH
LITTLE WARNING LIKE A MEAT
BRIGADOON.
MCRIB HUNTERS NEVER KNOW WHAT
BRIBS BRINGS IT OUT OF HIDING,
IS IT A SURPLUS OF
SLAUGHTERHOUSE FLOOR SCRAPINGS,
AND ITS CONTENTS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN CLOAKED IN MYSTERY, THE
MCDONALD'S SITE LISTS 70
INGREDIENTS NONE OF WHICH ARE
RIB, THOUGH IT DOES INCLUDE
AZO-DICARBON-AMIDE, A FLOUR
BLEACHING AGENT USED IN YOGA
MATS.
>> SO EVEN A MCRIB TECHNICALLY
COUNTS AS EXERCISE.
[ APPLAUSE ] AND THIS PHOTO
MIGHT JUST EXPLAIN MCDONALD'S
NEW SLOGAN, THINK WITH YOUR
MOUTH.
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK WITH YOUR
BRAIN, I AM NOT SURE IF YOU
WOULD EAT IT.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
