EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, THE STATE OF THE UNION
SPEECH WAS TONIGHT, AND AS MUCH
HAS BEEN MADE OF THE NEW TONE OF
CIVILITY SWEEPING WASHINGTON,
HOPEFULLY IT'S JUST ANOTHER FAD
LIKE POUNDERS WIGS AND HABEAS
CORPUS.
WE TAPE THIS SHOW BEFORE THE
STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OBAMA SAID,
SO HERE'S MY CRITIQUE.
I WAS SHOCKED AT THE PRESIDENT'S
LACK OF CIVILITY.
MR. OBAMA, DID YOU REALLY HAVE
THE CALL SENATOR OLIMP THAT
SNOWE A DIRTY WHORE?
( LAUGHTER )
AND IF YOU DIDN'T, I APOLOGIZE
TO EVERYONE INVOLVED.
NOW, THANKFULLY SOMEONE IS
MONITORING THIS OUTBREAK OF
CIVILITY, NAMELY THE FOLKS AT
BIGHOLLYWOOD.COM, WHO RECENTLY
POSTED A POLL ENTITLED "WHO IS
THE WORST VIOLATOR OF THE NEW
TONE -- STEPHEN COLBERT OR
TENNESSEE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
STEVE COHEN."
BIG HOLLYWOOD IS APPARENTLY
REFERRING TO WHEN I GAVE MIKA
BRZEZINSKI A PEP TALK ABOUT
COVERING SARAH PALIN.
I KNOW YOU THINK SHE HAS NOTHING
TO OFFER THE NATIONAL DIALOG AND
THAT HER SPEECHES ARE JUST
COATED TALKING POINTS MIXED IN
WITH WORDS PICKED UP AT RANDOM
FROM A THESAURUS.
I KNOW YOU THINK HER REALITY
SHOW WAS PATHETICALLY
UNSTATESMAN-LIKE, AND I KNOW YOU
BELIEVE IT ALSO REPRESENTS THE
PINNACLE OF HER POTENTIAL.
I KNOW BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT IN
YOUR EYES.
NOW I WASN'T SAYING THESE
THINGS.
MIKA'S EYES WERE SAYING THOSE
THINGS.
FOR THE RECORD, I BELIEVE SARAH
PALIN IS A TRUE STATESMAN WHOSE
EXPERIENCE AS FAILED VICE
PRESIDENT, CANDIDATE, HALF-TERM
GOVERNOR AND EIGHT-EPISODE
REALITY SHOW STAR HAS FULLY
PREPARED HER THE TAKE CONTROL OF
OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GOT TO GET THAT OUT THERE TO SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
BUT I ALSO WANT TO DEFEND
CONGRESSMAN STEVE COHEN, WHO WAS
DEEMED UNCIVIL JUST BECAUSE HE
SAID THIS ABOUT HOUSE
REPUBLICANS REPEAL OF HEALTH
CARE.
>> THEY SAY IT'S A GOVERNMENT
TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE.
A BIG LIE, JUST LIKE GERBLE.
>> NOW I COMMAND HIM FOR
SOFTENING THE RHETORIC.
HE DIDN'T COMPARE REPUBLICANS TO
HITLER, HE COMPARED THEM TO HIS
RIGHT HAND MAN JOSEPH GOEBBELS.
HE'S JUST THE BARNEY TO THEIR
FRED.
OH, AND HERE'S MY DEFAMATION
LAWSUIT FROM HANNAH-BARBERA.
OKAY.
I'LL JUST ADD THAT TO THE PILE.
OF COURSE, THE THINNED SKINNED
MAY STILL TAKE OFFENSE AS BEING
COMPARED TOO GOEBBELS.
FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO
DEMONIZE A POLITICAL OPPONENT, I
HAVE PRODUCED A CHART OF NAZIS
IN DESCENDING ORDER OF NAZINESS,
RATED ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10
HITLERS.
JIMMY, PUT UP THE NAZI
>> OMETER.
NOW, FIRST, I HOPE NO ONE USES
THIS CLIP OUT OF CONTEXT, HITLER
IS NUMBER ONE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING HIM NINE
HITLERS.
NOBODY GET TEN HITLER, LET'S NOT
GO OVERBOARD.
HE'S FOLLOWED CLOSELY BEHIND
RICK HIMMLER, HEAD OF THE S.S.
WHO WEIGHS IN AT EIGHT HITLERS.
HE'S GOT THE HAIR AND THE
MUSTACHE, BUT HE'S MISSING THAT
SPECIAL PIZAZZ.
FURTHER DOWN THE NAZI SCALE, OUR
OLD FRIEND GOEBBELS.
HE ONLY GETS 6.5 HITLERS.
AS ALWAYS, YOU ROUND UP TO THE
NEAREST HITLER.
BELOW GOEBBELS,
LENI RIEFENSTAHL.
SHE'S THE WORLD'S SECOND MOST
HATESSED DIRECTOR AFTER MICHAEL
BAY.
THEN BRINGING UP THE REAR, YOU
HAVE COLONEL KLINK FROM "HOGAN'S
HEROES."
HE GETS HALF A HITLER, BUT TWO
EMMYS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
HE REALLY CAPTURED THAT NOT I NAZI
SEFNTION OF HUMOR.
OF COURSE, SOME SAY STEVE COHEN
SHOULDN'T USE THE FLOOR OF
CONGRESS TO COMPARE ANYONE TO
ANY SORT OF NAZI.
