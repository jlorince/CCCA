EXHAUST, WE'LL NEVER RUN OUT.
FOLKS, OUR LAWMAKERS' POPULARITY
KEEPS SINKING FASTER THAN A
RESEARCH FACILITY AT THE NORTH
POLE.
IN THE LATEST PHONE SURVEY ABOUT
CONGRESS, IT RANKED BELOW HAVING
YOUR DINNER INTERRUPTED BY A
PHONE SURVEY ABOUT CONGRESS.
BUT THESE NUMBERS HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE JOB THAT THE
LAWMAKERS ARE DOING BECAUSE THEY
ARE NOT DOING IT.
HALFWAY THROUGH 2013 JUST 15
BILLS PASSED BY CONGRESS HAD
BECOME LAW.
THEY ALMOST PASSEDDED A 16th
BILL BUT OBAMA REFUSED TO SIGN
HR-2904, THE "THIS IS NOT
ANOTHER REPEAL OF OBAMA CARE, WE
SWEAR BUT DON'T LOOK INSIDE IT,
JUST SIGN IT" ACT.
BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME CONGRESS FOR
HOW LITTLE THEY GET DONE.
TAKING A POSITION ON ANYTHING IS
POLITICAL SUICIDE.
JUST LOOK AT SENATE MINORITY
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL.
HE'S THE MOST OBSTRUCTIONIST,
BILL-BLOCKIN'EST HUMAN LAW-CORK
EVER TO JAM UP THE HAULS OF
CONGRESS USING THE FILIBUSTER
413 TIMES SINCE 2007, TWICE AS
MUCH AS THE LAST DEMOCRATIC
MINORITY WHICH EARNED HIM THE
NICKNAME "SENATOR GRIDLOCK."
YEAH, GOOD OLSEN TORE GRIDLOCK,
THE KENTUCKY CONSTIPATOR, THE
LOUISVILLE PLUGGER.
BUT EVEN THE LEADER OF THE
DO-NOTHING CONGRESS IS IS NOW
BEING PUNISHED FOR THE HANDFUL
OF TIMES HE DONE DID SOMETHING.
>> MITCH McCONNELL IS GETTING
PRIMARIED HARD.
AN OPEN LETTER, THIS IS
INCREDIBLE TO ME, FROM 15
KENTUCKY TEA PARTY GROUPS SAID
SENATOR McCONNELL'S
PROGRESSIVE, LIBERAL VOTING
RECORD AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO
ROLL OVER AND CEDE POWER TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE LIBERALS
IN WASHINGTON PROVE HE IS NO
FRIEND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR
THE CITIZENS OF THE COMMONWEALTH
OF KENTUCKY
>> Stephen: I KNEW THIS GUY WAS
A LEFT WING PROGRESSIVE LOON IN
2010 WHEN HE SAID THIS.
>> OUR TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SHOULD
BE TO DENY PRESIDENT OBAMA A
SECOND TERM.
