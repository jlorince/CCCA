LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THIS SHOW IS REALLY ABOUT YOU.
I AM BUT YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT.
AND, FOLKS, IT IS NICE FOR OUR
ROYAL BABY COVERAGE AND WE CAN
NOW REPORT OFFICIALLY-- I'VE
BEEN TOLD WE CAN REPORT
OFFICIALLY HIS ROYAL HYANNIS
PRINCE GEORGE OF CAMBRIDGE
UMBILICAL STUMP HAS DRIED UP AND
WILL FLAKE OFF IN THREE TO 10
DAYS.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PICTURE OF
IT.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
YUP, YEAH.
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
THAT SHOULD BE COMING OFF PRETTY
SOON.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, WE ALL
REMEMBER HOW WE FIRST LEARNED
THE JOYOUS NEWS.
>> THE FIRST BORN OF THE ROYAL
HYANNIS, THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF
CAMBRIDGE.
THE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE
THRONE.
MAY HE BE LONG LIVED, HAPPY, AND
GLORIOUS, AND ONE DAY REIGN OVER
US.
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
>> Stephen: YES, LONDON'S
OFFICIAL TOWN CRIER WAS
EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT, OTHER
THAN INTELLIGIBLE.
THE ONLY WAY HE COULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER IS IF HE WERE REAL.
>> THE GUY WHO BECAME THE FACE
AND THE VOICE OF THE ROYAL BABY
ANNOUNCEMENT APPEARS TO BE A
FAKE.
A PARTY CRASHER.
WHEN THE TOWN CRIER STEPPED UP
TO ANNOUNCE THE BIRTH OF THE
FUTURE KING, EVERYONE LISTENED,
ASSUMING IT WAS PART OF THE PAG
PAGEANTRY OF THE BIRTH OF THE
FUTURE KING.
TURNS OUT, HE WAS NOT INVITED BY
THE ROYAL FAMILY.
IN FACT, HE'S NOT EVEN A
LONDONER.
>> Stephen: SHE WAS A FAKE
TOWN CRIER.
I MEAN, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HIS
HAT FEATURED A CODE OF ARM WITH
A LION AND UNICORN WHEN THE
NATIONAL COAT OF ARMS OF LONDON
IS TWO DRAGONS.
ALSO, THE BACK OF HIS JACKET HAD
"LONG JUNE SILVER'S."
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
IT TURNS OUT, THE TOWN CRIER IS
JUST A ROYAL LOVER NAMED TONY
APPLETON, WHO IS AVAILABLE AS A
MASTER OF CEREMONIESES AT
WEDDINGS, BIRTHDAYS, AND BAR
MITZVAHS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEAR YE!
HEAR YE!
HEAR YE!
HEAR YE!
HEAR YE!
HEAR YE!

MAZEL, MAZEL.
LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AARON COHEN
HAS GONE FROM BOY TO MAN.

NOW LET'S GET IT STARTED IN HERE
WITH YONKERS PREMIERE HIP-HOP
COVER BAND THE BLACK EYED PEAS.
GOD SAVE THE WHOLE MESHPUKA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( BELL RINGING )
BUT HERE'S THE THING, FOLKS, IF
THIS GUY IS NOT REAL, THEN I
CAN'T TRUST ANY OF IT.
THE WHOLE ROYAL FAMILY COULD BE
A SCAM!
I MEAN, THEY DON'T DO A DAMN
THING.
WHY SHOULD WE CARE?
IN FACT,UN WHAT, JIMMY?
I HAVE A SUSPICION-- PUT UP THE
PHOTO OF WILAND KATE AND ZOOM
IN.
