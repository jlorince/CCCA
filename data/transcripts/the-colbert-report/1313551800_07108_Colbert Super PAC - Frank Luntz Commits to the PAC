THAT'S FRANK RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S THE MAN.
I RECENTLY SAT DOWN WITH FRANK
LUNTZ IN HIS MIND LAB.
MR. LUNTZ, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> PLEASURE.
AND IT'S DOCTOR.
>> Stephen: IT DRES?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
FRANK...
(LAUGHTER)
I WANT THE BEST FOR MY SUPER
PACK.
YOU WORKED WITH HUGE PEOPLE:
NEWT GINGRICH, MICROSOFT,
McDONALD'S.
IF
♪ I'M LOVING IT... ♪
IS THAT YOU?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET THAT GUY?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THAT GUY.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
YOUR SLOGAN IS "IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU SAY, IT'S A WHAT THEY HEAR."
>> THE KEY PROCESS IN
COMMUNICATION IS TO LISTEN TO
YOUR AUDIENCE CAREFULLY AND
ACTUALLY HEAR WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING AND UNDERSTAND THE HOPES
AND FEARS BEHIND....
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T CATCH SOME OF THAT.
CAN YOU REPEAT IT?
I APOLOGIZE.
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT WITH YOUR
AUDIENCE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> LISTEN.
>> Stephen: LISTEN.
OKAY.
LISTEN.
>> FOCUS.
FOCUS.
NOW LOOK THEM STRAIGHT IN THE
EYE.
NOT WITH A BIG EYE, I MEAN
LIKE... THERE YOU GO, THAT'S
BETTER.
DON'T SQUINT BECAUSE THAT LOOKS
LIKE YOU'RE BEING DISHONEST AND
DON'T BREATHE HEAVY BECAUSE....
>> Stephen: MAN, I'M DOING MY
BEST HERE, YOU'RE JACKING ME ALL
OVER THE PLACE.
>> THE IDEA IS TO CHALLENGE YOU
BUT NOT MAKE YOU FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.
THAT'S GREAT, WHAT YOU JUST DID.
>> Stephen: WHAT DID I DO?
>> YOU ADJUSTED YOUR GLASSES.
YOU DEMONSTRATED AN INTELLECTUAL
CAPABILITY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THERE'S TWO WAYS TO DO THAT,
THE ONE IS THE GLASSES
ADJUSTMENT, THE OTHER ONE WOULD
TO TAKE THEM OFF, LOOK AT THEM,
PONDER FOR A MOMENT AND THEN YOU
PUT THEM BACK ON.
A LITTLE BIT SLOWER.
YOU WANT TO BE MORE SUBTLE.
THERE'S THAT SLOW APPROACH.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW YOU THINK, NOW YOU PUT THEM
BACK ON, GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO
PAUSE.
PEOPLE LOOK AND SAY "YOU KNOW
WHAT?
HE WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT
WHAT HE'S SAYING."
>> Stephen: WHEN, IN FACT, I'M
MERELY TAKING A LONG PAUSE.
THIS IS SO GOOD.
YOU'VE HELPED COME UP WITH SOME
NOTABLE TERMS IN OUR POLITICAL
DISCOURSE."
ENERGY EXPLORATION."
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT?
>> IT WAS TRYING TO COME UP A
MORE POSITIVE VISION.
>> Stephen: INSTEAD OF WHAT
PHRASE?
>> DRILLING FOR OIL.
>> Stephen: DILLING FOR OIL.
DOES IT MATTER IF MOST ENERGY
EXPLORATION IS OIL DRILLING?
>> BUT IT ISN'T!
>> Stephen: IT IS.
>> THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF
ENERGY.
>> Stephen: THERE ARE OTHER
FORMS BUT THE EFFORT IS FOR OIL.
>> KEEP IT SIMPLE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
SO ENERGY EXPLORATION, NOT OIL
DRILLING.
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: CLIMATE CHANGE, NOT
GLOBAL WARMING.
>> YI.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I THINK THAT
IS BRILLIANT, NOT MANIPULATIVE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
YOU CREATED A LIST OF 11 WORDS
OF 2011 WHICH IS A LIST OF THE
HOTTEST WORDS.
YOU SAID THINGS LIKE "IMAGINE.
REALTIME, YOU DECIDE."
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER WORDS
JUMPING OUT TO YOU THIS YEAR?
>> "THE SIMPLE TRUTH."
>> Stephen: THE SIMPLE TRUTH.
>> THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT WE
CAN'T SPEND MORE MONEY THAN WE
TAKE IN.
>> Stephen: YOU DECIDE.
>> I WOULD ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE
BEFORE I GOT TO YOU DECIDE.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN THROW ALL
THESE WORDS TOGETHER IN A SINGLE
SENTENCE.
>> Stephen: YOU DECIDE REALTIME.
>> THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE
COMMUNICATION.
>> Stephen: IT'S GOT THREE OF
THE BUZZ WORDS IN THERE.
>> YES, BUT YOU NEED TO SPREAD
THEM OUT.
>> Stephen: FRANK, I IMAGINE
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DECIDE IN
REALTIME
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU'RE DANGEROUS.
>> Stephen: THAT A BUZZ WORD?
>> NO.
WORDS NEED TO HAVE A PURPOSE.
THEY NEED TO BREATHE.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT SHOULD I NOT
DO?
>> YOU GET ONE SHOT TO USE THE
SIMPLE TRUTH.
DON'T USE IT MORE THAN ONCE.
>> Stephen: SIMPLE TRUTH.
I BLEW IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU CAN USE IT MORE THAN
THAT.
>> Stephen: TWICE?
>> THIS IS DIFFICULT.
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS WORKING.
>> Stephen: IT'S WORKING FOR ME.
>> THEN I GUESS I SHOULD BE
HAPPY.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S ANOTHER WORD
FOR HAPPY?
>> SATISFIED, CONTENT.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ANY OF THOSE
THINGS?
>> NO.
THIS IS A....
>> Stephen: THIS IS ABOUT
PLEASING FRANK LUNTZ.
>> BUT IT ISN'T.
IT'S ABOUT HELPING YOU STAY
FOCUSED.
>> Stephen: SORRY, I APOLOGIZE.
>> THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING
TO DO, BY THE WAY.
>> Stephen: APOLOGIZE?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY.
>> THE ULTIMATE THING A
CANDIDATE CAN DO IS TO BASICALLY
APOLOGIZE THREE TIMES.
"I'M SORRY, I MADE A MISTAKE,
FORGIVE ME."
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
WRONG FIRST, RIGHT?
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO WRONG?
>> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WRONG?
>> Stephen: NOTHING IN
PARTICULAR.
>> YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
WRONG?
>> Stephen: I ASSAULTED A SEA
TURTLE WITH A FLASHLIGHT WHEN I
WAS 17.
>> WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
>> Stephen: I WAS HIGH AND I
THOUGHT IT WAS A MONSTER.
>> SO NOW IT'S KNOWLEDGE THAT
YOU AWE SALTED WILDLIFE.
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.
I WOULD SUGGEST THIS NOT BE PART
OF THIS INTERVIEW AND THAT YOU
NOT USE THIS TO HELP FUND RAISE.
>> Stephen: SO EDIT THIS OUT?
>> DEFINITELY.
>> Stephen: I APOLOGIZE FOR
TALKING ABOUT IT.
THAT WAS MISTAKE TO TALK ABOUT
ASSAULTING A SEA TURTLE WITH A
FLASHLIGHT.
>> AND THE LAST PHRASE IS?
>> Stephen: FORGIVE ME.
>> PERFECT.
>> Stephen: NOW IS THAT AAPOLOGY
TO THE SEA TURT?
>> THAT'S AN APOLOGY TO THE
AUDIENCE.
I THINK SEA TURTLE IS SCREWED.
>> Stephen: WELL, I CAN SEE
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE, LET'S MOVE
ON.
ARE YOU READY TO HELP ME
GENERATE SOME IDEAS FOR COLBERT
SUPER PAC?
>> WITH YOUR LANGUAGE, YOU AND I
TOGETHER CAN CREATE AN AD THAT
WORKS WITH DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS.
THAT SCORES WITH THE SOUTH AND
THE NORTH.
THAT SCORES WITH A 25-YEAR-OLD
AND A 65-YEAR-OLD.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THE AD, THE AD HAS TO BE
ABOUT THESE IDEAS.
>> I WILL COMMIT TO TAKING THOSE
WORDS AND FINDING A WAY TO
TRANSFORM POLITICS AS WE KNOW
IT.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COOPERATE WITH
ME.
THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE WORDS.
>> Stephen: I IMAGINE THAT IN
REALTIME...
>> WILL YOU COOPERATE.
>> Stephen: THE SIMPLE TRUTH
IS...
>> YES OR NO.
>> Stephen: I AM SORRY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> Stephen: I'M TRYING TO
APOLOGIZE.
>> RIGHT BUT THERE'S A TIME AND
A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING.
ARE YOU WITH ME?
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY WITH YOU,
FRANK LUNTZ.
>> LET'S PUT MONEY ON IT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> DO A THOUSAND DOLLARS.
>> Stephen: I'M 1000% DOWN WITH
THAT.
>> GOOD.
>> Stephen: FRANK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID BUT I KNOW WHAT I
HEARD.
(APPLAUSE)
FRANK LUNTZ!
HIS BOOK IS CALLED "WIN" AND WE
WILL HAVE MORE WITH FRANK LUNTZ
AND WE'LL TRANSFORM AMERICAN
POLITICS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
