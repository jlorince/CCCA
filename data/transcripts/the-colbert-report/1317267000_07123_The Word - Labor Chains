NATION, REGULAR VIEWERS KNOW
THAT LAST NIGHT I DEFENDED TEXAS
GOVERNOR RICK PERRY FOR LAST
WEEKEND'S TONGUE-TIED DEBATE
PERFORMANCE.
BUT IN REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE,
FOLKS, I HAVE TO ADMIT, HE DID
MAKE ONE MAJOR GAFFE.
ONE TALKS ABOUT COLLEGE TUITION
SUBSIDIES FOR CHILDREN OF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
>> IF YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT
EDUCATE CHILDREN WHO COME INTO
OUR STATE FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT THERE
BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, I
DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A HEART.
>> Stephen: BOO.
BOO TO YOU, SIR.
THAT'S NOT... THAT DOES NOT PLAY
WELL WITH THE BASE.
JIM?
>> RICK PERRY MADE A BIG MISTAKE
ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION.
>> CONSERVATIVES GOT MAD AT HIM.
>> CONSERVATIVES ARE OFFENDED
WHEN YOU SUGGEST THEY DON'T HAVE
A HEART.
>> Stephen: YES, BECAUSE
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS, ALL
AMERICANS HAVE HEARTS.
THERE'S JUST NO ROOM IN THERE
FOR IMMIGRANTS BECAUSE THE
VENTRICLES ARE FILLED WITH NACHO
CHEESE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FOLKS, THERE ARE TEN MILLION
ILLEGALS IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE ARE WAY TOO SOFT WHEN IT
COMES TO APPREHENDING THEM.
CASE IN POINT, WHEN I HANDCUFF A
SUSPECTED ILLEGAL, I'M THE ONE
THAT GETS KICKED OUT OF AN EMMY
AFTER-PARTY?
MY APOLOGIES TO SOPHIA VERGARA.
NOW, LUCKILY I'M GRACIOUS ABOUT
IT.
LUCKILY SOME PEOPLE ARE
SUPPORTING THEIR SYMPATHY AND
GETTING TOUGH ON IMMIGRANTS, AND
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
WORD.
LABOR PAINS.
FOLKS, IF AMERICA IS GOING TO
SOLVE OUR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
PROBLEMS, WE NEED TO LOOK INSIDE
OURSELVES WITH AN EMOTIONAL
MELON BALLER AND SCOOP OUT ANY
VESTIGE OFçó HUMANKINDNESS.
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
PREGNANT ILLEGALS.
THEY'RE THE MOST DEVIOUS KIND
BECAUSE THEY SNEAK ACROSS OUR
BORDER WITH ANOTHER IMMIGRANT
HIDING INSIDE THEM.
FOR ALLçó WE KNOW, THERE'S ANOTHER
ONE HIDING INSIDE THE BABY.
NOW THESE WOMEN... THESE WOMEN
KNOW THAT THE SECOND THEY DROP
THEIR ANCHOR BABY ON U.S. SOIL
THE ILLEGAL RESOURCE-SUCKING
PARASITE INSIDE THEM THAT'S BEEN
STEALING JOBS FROM AMERICAN
EMBRYOS IS INSTANTLY TRANSFORMED
INTO THE GREATEST, BESTEST,
FREEST BABY IN THE WORLD.
YOU ARE SO CUTE.
YES, YOU ARE.
WHO DESERVES A FREE EDUCATION?
YOU DO.
YOU DO.
YOU SEE, I LOVE THIS BABY
BECAUSE HE IS AN AMERICAN.
BUT IF THAT BABY WERE BORN IN
MEXICO, HEY, SPEAK-A DA ENGLAIS,
GOO-GOO, GA-GA.
NOW LUCKILY SOME STATES HAVE
FOUND A GREAT WAY TO DISCOURAGE
THESE WOMEN FROM COMING HERE AND
SQUATTING OUT A FREEDOM FETUS.
RECENTLY IN ARIZONA AND
TENNESSEE, THREE PREGNANT WOMEN
WERE ARRESTED FOR NOT HAVING
PROPER IDENTIFICATION AND FORCED
TO GIVE BIRTH SHACKLED TO THEIR
HOSPITAL BEDS WITHOUT THEIR
HUSBANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF
PRISON GUARDS.
SO A QUICK TIP FOR THE OLIVE
SKINNED LADIES WHEN THEY'RE AT
TEN CENTIMETERS AND FULLY
EFFACED, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO
FIND YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE.
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN CONFRONTED
WITH A WOMAN IN LABOR, SOME LAW
ENFORCEMENT LAX THE AUTHORITY TO
SLAP THEM IN FOUR-POINT
RESTRAINTS BECAUSE SADLY THIS IS
LEGAL IN ONLY 36 STATES.
FOLKS, I SAY THIS IS DANGEROUS.
WE HAVE TO MANACLE THESE
MAMASITAS DOWN.
I MEAN, EVEN AMERICAN WOMEN IN
LABOR ARE DANGEROUS.
THEY HAVE SUPER STRENGTH AND
THEY GET MEAN AS A SNAKE.
MY WIFE TURNED INTO A
WOLF-HEADED SHE-CREATURE.
BUT I SAY... I SAY CHAINING
DOWN, CHAINING DOWN THESE WOMEN
IN LABOR IS NOT FAR ENOUGH.
SHE'S ALREADY SHACKLED TO A
HOSPITAL BED, WHY DON'T WE JUST
ROLL IT DOWN TO THE SOUTHERN
BORDER, CUT A HOLE IN THE WALL
AND LET HER POP THAT BABY OUT
INTO MEXICO.
THAT WAY IT'S NOT AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN AND I DON'T HAVE TO
TREAT IT WITH HUMAN DECENCY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, THIS
IS IMPORTANT, ATTENDING
PHYSICIANS PLEASE BE CAREFUL
WHEN DELIVERING THE INFANT.
DON'T CUT THE UMBILICAL CORD.
NOW THAT IT'S OFFICIALLY
MEXICAN, WE'RE GOING TO REEL
THAT BABY BACK INTO AMERICA.
YOU SEE, WE'RE GOING... WE'RE
GOING TO NEED IT.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
WE'RE GOING THE NEED THAT BABY
FOR CHEAP, UNREGULATED LABOR.
THOSE SMALL SOFT HANDS ARE
PERFECT FOR HARVESTING
CLEMENTINES.
[LAUGHTER]
WE DO NOT WANT TO END UP WITH
BRUISED FRUIT.
THAT WOULD BE HEARTLESS.
AND THAT'S "THE WORD."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
