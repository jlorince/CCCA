(LAUGHTER)MEANWHILE, ELECTORALLY BACK
HERE IN AMERICA THE MID-TERMELECTIONS ARE UPON US AND I
COULD NOT BE MOREMID-EXCITED.
I AM HALF PUMPED.
BECAUSE, BECAUSE THEDEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO GET
WHIPPED LIKE ONE OF THEIRBELOVED SMOOTHIES.
PINEAPPLE AND MANGO BLENDEDTOGETHER AS ONE.
I'M SORRY, THAT IS FRUITSODOMY.
BY THE WAY, DO NOT GOOGLEFRUIT SODOMY.
(LAUGHTER)AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO THE
PLUMMETING POPULARITY OFBARACK OBAMA.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'SAPPROVAL RATING TAKING A
NOSEDIVE ACCORDINGTO A NEW "WASHINGTON POST"
ABC NEWS POLL, PRESIDENT'SAPPROVAL RATING HAS HIT A
NEW LOW, 41%.
>> Stephen: 41%.
THAT MEANS HE'S ONLY 35%MORE POPULAR THAN CONGRESS.
(LAUGHTER)AND THE BAD NEWS DOES NOT END
THERE.
BECAUSE THAT SAME"WASHINGTON POST" ABC NEWS
POLL FOUND THAT 53% OFVOTERS SAY THEY WOULD RATHER
SEE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESSCONTROL OF CONGRESS.
THAT IS GREAT NEWS, IF THE GOPTAKES BOTH HOUSES THEY'LL
FINALLY BE ABLE TO ADVANCETHEIR IDEAS WHICH SHOULD
REALLY MOTIVATE THEM TO HAVEAN IDEA.
(LAUGHTER)NOW ANOTHER BLOW, ANOTHER
BLOW TO THE DONKEY-CRAT HOPESIS THAT JUST 23% OF
AMERICANS IN THE AGE OF 18AND 29 SAY THEY WILL
DEFINITELY BE VOTING IN THENOVEMBER ELECTION.
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT FORSOME REASON COLLEGE STUDENTS
AREN'T THRILLED BY THE WORDMIDTERM.
AND-- (LAUGHTER)
MILLENNIALS TEND TOVOTE FOR DEMOCRATS SO THEIR
APATHY MAKES ME HAPPY.
OR AS THE YOUNGSTERS SAYHASHTAG SAXOPHONE EMOJI.
WITH ALL THIS BAD NEWS IT ISNO SURPRISE DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING
HAIL MARYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,CASE IN POINT NORTH CAROLINA'S
DISTRICT WHICH IS CURRENTLYREPRESENTED BY REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSWOMAN AND PERSON INALLERGY AD RENEE ELLMERS.
SHE WON HER SEAT BYCAMPAIGNING ON AN ISSUE SO
IMPORTANT TO THE NORTHERNMOST PART OF HER DISTRICT,
MANHATTAN.
>> THE TERRORISTS HAVEN'TWON.
AND WE SHOULD TELL THEM INPLAIN ENGLISH, NO.
THERE WILL NEVER BE A MOSQUEAT GROUND ZERO, I'M RENEE
ELLMERS AND I APPROVE THIS AD.
>> Stephen: STRONG STATEMENT,OF COURSE THAT AD UPSET
NORTH CAROLINA'S MUSLIMCOMMUNITY, BOTH OF THEM.
BUT THAT'S NOT ELLMERS ONLYACCOMPLISHMENT.
LAST FALL SHE ALSO VOTED TOSHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
WHO CAN FORGET THE MESSAGEOF HOPE SHE SENT THOSE
FEDERAL WORKERS THAT HERVOTE LAID OFF.
>> THE THING OF IT IS I NEEDMY PAYCHECK.
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBETHERE ARE SOME OTHER MEMBERS
WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, DEFERRINGTHEIR PAYCHECKS AND I THINK
THAT IS ADMIRABLE.
I'M NOT IN THAT POSITION.
>> Stephen: YES, SHE WASN'TIN THAT POSITION.
AND NEITHER WERE THEWORKERS.
THEY WERE BENDING OVER ANDTAKING IT.
AND IF SHE WEREN'T, IF SHEWEREN'T ENOUGH OF A SHOE-IN
ALREADY, GET A LOAD OF WHOTHE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING
AGAINST HER.
>> I'M CLAY AIKEN.
YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY-- (LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: YES, I DO WONDERWHY YOU ARE RUNNING.
IS IT BECAUSE THERE HASN'TBEEN ANYONE IN CONGRESS WITH
SUCH GOLDEN PIPES SINCESENATOR JOHN ASHCROFT ♪ LET
THE EAGLE SOAR ♪♪ LIKE SHE'S NEVER SOARED
BEFORE ♪♪.

MY EARS.
