FOLKS, THEY SAY YOU CAN'T MAKEAN OMELET WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW
EGGS.
I SAY THEY'VE NEVER TRIED MYWESTERN SCRUNCH SCRAMBLER.
THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD.
YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS ON THELOOKOUT FOR INNOVATIONS AND FAST
FOODS.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED BYTHIS NEW CONCEPT IN EATING
QUICKLY.

>> THAT LOOKS BETTER THAN THIS.
>> 10-31 IN PROGRESS.
>> YOU TAKE THIS.
>> Stephen:  CHICKEN AND FRIESTOGETHER IN A CUP?
THIS IS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZETHE WAY I EAT MEET.
IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT A"10-31 IN PROGRESS MEANS" THE
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL SAYSIT'S AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
WHICH--( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )WE LOOKED IT UP.
WE LOOKED IT UP.
WHICH, INTENTALLY, IS HOW THEU.S.D.A. CLASSIFIES THE GO-CUP.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )

K.F.C. SALES DEPARTMENT HASNOTHING ON THE INTEGRATE THE
MARKETING GENIUSES AT FOX NEWS.

CHICKEN AND FRIES IN EASY REACH.
GOOD IDEA.
>> REVOLUTIONARY CUP IS MADE TOFIT INSIDE YOUR CAR'S CUP
HOLDER.
>> Stephen:  AND THE FOX ANDFRIENDS PRODUCT PLACEMENT DID
NOT STOP THERE.
THEY WERE JOINED ON THE COMFYCOUCH BY A TALKING DRUMMED
STICK.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, THE GO-CUP IS A GOODIDEA, BUT IT COULD BE GOODER.
LAST TIME I CHECKED, THE CUPHOLDER IS STILL AN ARM'S LENGTH
AWAY FROM THE OLD GRUB-CHUTE,AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN PUT
THE GO-CUP BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.
THAT'S WHERE THE TUB OF BEN &JERRY'S GOES.
ALL THE, EFFECTIVE BIRTHCONTROL.
CHILLS DOWN THE SWIRMS.
FOLKS, TONIGHT, I AM PROUD TOINTRODUCE MY OWN BETTER IDEA,
K.F.C.'S WHEEL MEAT.

THE WHEEL MEAT.
IT'S A ONE-PIECE CIRCULARMACRO-NUGGET THAT MOUNTS SNUGLY
ON TO YOUR STEERING COLUMN.
YOU GET TWO SAUCES -- HONEMUSTARD ON THE LEFT, AND
BARBECUE ON THE RIGHT.
AND YOUR CHICKEN GETS SOFTTHROUGH THE NATURAL COURSE OF
TURNING.
AND REMEMBER, IT'S HANDS AT 10AND 2, MOUTH AT 12.
( LAUGHTER )WHEN IT'S TIME FOR DE-- DEJERT
RAM INTO A TELEPHONE POLEBECAUSE YOUR AIRBAG IS NOW APPLE
PIE.

NEXT UP, AS A PROUD MALE GROCERYSHOPPER I'M SHOCKED BY A NEW
ARTICLE IN THE "WALL STREETJOURNAL" THE REPORT THAT MEN ARE
DOING A GREATER SHARE OF THEGROCERY SHOPPING AND MEAL
PREPARATION.
EVEN MORE SHOCK-- THIS IS NOT ANARTICLE FROM 1952.
( LAUGHTER )THE GOOD-- LET'S CALL IT NEWS--
IS THAT THE FOOD INDUSTRY ISTAKING NOTICE.
>> JUST HOW MANLY IS YOUR FOOD?
THEY'RE INJECTING TESTOSTERONEFUEL MARKETING INTO THEIR BRAND.
>> ONE OF MY FAVORITES ISPOWERFUL YOGURT.
THEY FELT THE YOGURT SECTIONFELT OVERLY FEMALE.
YOU CAN SEE THE BULL HORNSPROMOTING PROTEIN.
>> Stephen:  YUP, BULL'SHORNS.
THIS YOGURT IS EXTRA MANLYBECAUSE EVIDENTLY IT'S MADE FROM
BULL MILK.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
VERY DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE.
BUT THE BULL WILL THANK YOU.
( APPLAUSE )POWERFUL YOGURT, FOLKS, POWERFUL
YOGURT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANYPRODUCTS TARGETED AT A NEW BREED
OF MALE SHOPPERS THAT MARKETERSARE CALLING MANFLUENCERS.
I CAN TELL YOU, THEY'RE VERY MANFLEWENTIAL.
THEY ALSO MANFLUENCED ME INTOTHINKING MANFLUENCE IS A WORD.
AND THE TESTOSTERONE DOES NOTSTOP WITH THE MACHO COLOR
SCHEMES.
MARKETERS ARE REBRANDINGPRODUCTS WITH MAN-FRIENDLY NAMES
LIKE KILLER BREAD, AND ULTIMATEHAMBURGER HELPER.
ALTHOUGH, THIS FTHEY REALLYWANTED TO BRO IT UP, THEY'D CALL
IT "HAMBURGER SHOPPER."
WE'LL BE RIGHT
