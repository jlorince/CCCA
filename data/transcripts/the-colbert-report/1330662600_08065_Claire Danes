>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY GUEST
TONIGHT PLAYS A BIPOLACIA
SECT IN THE SHOW HOMELAND.
THAT MEANS SHE'S BOTH GOOD
COP AND BAD COP.
PLEASE WELCOME CLAIRE DANES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, CLAIRE, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW YOUNG LADY, GOOD TO SEE
YOU AGAIN.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.
>> Stephen: LAST TIME YOU
WERE ON HERE IT WAS FOR
TEMPLE GRANDIN WHICH YOU
WENT ON TO WIN THE EMMY FOR,
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> WELL, THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU ARE ON
HOMELAND, JUST WON THE
GOLDEN GLOBE FOR THAT.
>> I DID.
>> Stephen: THAT'S CALLED
THE COLBERT BUMP.
THAT'S THE DOUBLE BUMP, I
SWEAR, AFTER THIS INTERVIEW
NEXT YEAR YOU WILL BE THE
FIRST PERSON EVER TO WIN AN
OSCAR FOR A TV PERFORMANCE.
>> I BET THAT'S TRUE.
A TTRIBUTE ALL OF MY SUCCESS
TO YOU, FOR SURE.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WISE, AT
LEAST IN THE NEXT SIX
MINUTES.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: NOW THIS SHOW,
HOMELAND, YOU PLAY A
CHARACTER WITH A PARTICULAR
SORT OF EMOTIONAL ISSUE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
AND WE GOT A LITTLE CLIP
HERE.
JIMMY, CRACK US OFF A PIECE
OF ACTING RIGHT HERE.
>> IT IS WHAT I WANT.
>> AND BLUE IS WHAT I IS
AVAILABLE.
>> OKAY, GREEN IS IMPORTANT.
GREEN IS NECESSARY.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF IT
DIDN'T ISN'T GREEN AND IT IS
REALLY NOT AN UNREASONABLE
REQUEST.
OH, THANK GOD, MY GREEN PEN
IS DRY.
I ASKED FOUR, FIVE, SIX
TIMES FOR A NEW ONE BUT
THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING.
THEY OFFER ME BLUE, BLACK, I
MEAN IS GREEN SO HARD.
IS GREEN ELUSIVE.
I MEAN MY KINGDOM FOR A
[BLEEP] GREEN PEN.
>> SHE SHOULD GO TO HER ROOM.
>> Stephen: YOU, YOU --
>> THAT'S NOT MY GREEN PEN S
IT.
>> Stephen: THIS IS NOT YOUR
GREEN PEN, ACTUALLY THIS IS
A BLUE PEN.
>> THAT'S PRETTY HOT, YOU
KNOW, IF I'M NOT GOING TO
GET A GREEN PEN I WOULD
SETTLE FOR THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER.
>> SO MANY THINGS.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> SO MANY THINGS.
>> Stephen: I MEANS
THAT'S-- THAT'S SLIGHTLY
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.
>> YES, SHE IS A LITTLE
UNHINGED IN THAT PARTICULAR
MOMENT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS HER
ISSUE.
>> SHE IS BIPOLAR AND SHE'S
DONE A FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL JOB
OF KEEPING IT UNDER CONTROL,
TAMING IT.
SHE, HER SISTER IS A DOCTOR
SO SHE HAS BEEN KIND OF
GETTING MEDS ON THE SLY, BUT
SHE GETS, SHE-- .
>> Stephen: DOES IT HELP HER
IN ANY WAY.
>> NO, NO, IT HELPS, SHE IS
DOING WELL, UNTIL, UNTIL SHE
GETS BLOWN UP.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT-- THAT
TENDS TO TAKE A SPRING OUT
OF YOUR STEP.
>> NO, IT'S-- YEAH, SO THAT,
THAT UNDERMINED HER
SLIGHTLY.
AND SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED.
SHE WENT OFF OF HER MEDS AND
THEN THAT HAPPENS.
>> Stephen: SO IS IT ONE OF
THOSE, LIKE BEAUTIFUL MIND
THINGS WHERE YOU HAVE GOT A
LITTLE BIT OF A MENTAL
DEFICIT THAT LETS YOU
CONNECT THE DOTS.
>> IT IS LIKE THAT.
SHE DOES HAVE THESE
INCREDIBLE INSIGHTS BUT, AS
A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH BIPOLAR
CONDITIONS DO.
AND THEY WOULD HAVE JUST
BECOME A TANGLED MESS, ABOUT
HER COLLEAGUE, HELPS
ORGANIZE IT FOR HER.
SO IT IS ACTUALLY VERY
BEAUTIFUL.
>> Stephen: THE SOLVING
THESE KRIRMS.
>> YES, THEY WORK
COLLABORATIVELY.
>> Stephen: THE JOB HAS
GIVEN HER FOCUS TO STUDY THE
MANIA.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU
STUDY THIS.
SOME SAY I'M NOT AN ACTOR
BUT SOME ACKERS SAY THEY
HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
WITHIN THEMSELVES THAT IS
LIKE THE CHARACTER IS THERE
ANYTHING IN YOU THAT IS
BIPOLAR?
AND THIS IS A SAFE, SAFE
SPACE, NONE OF THIS WILL BE
BROADCAST.
GO.
>> I REALLY, REALLY HOPE
NOT.
I REALLY, REALLY HOPE NOT.
SO FAR SO GOOD.
BUT NO, IT WAS-- IT IS MAKE
BELIEVE.
BUT NO, IT WAS FASCINATING
TO LEARN ABOUT.
>> Stephen: HOW DID YOU, HOW
DO YOU LEARN ABOUT PIPE
BOMBERS AND CIA AT
THE-- BIPOLAR AND THE CIA AT
THE SAME TIME.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THAT IS ONE OF
THE SIGN, ONE OF THE EARLY
SIGNS RIGHT THERE.
SO HOW DO YOU STUDY, LIKE
HOW DO YOU LEARN ABOUT THE
CIA.
>> WELL, I READ A LOT OF
BOOKS.
ACTUALLY MY BOOK CLUB
FRIENDS ARE HERE TONIGHT AND
I NEED TO SAY HI.
SPEAKING OF BOOKS.
I READ A LOT OF BOOKS.
WE READ AS A CLUB READ SOME
OF MY BOOKS, SO I READ, AND
I WORKED WITH A CIA OFFICER.
AND SHE, WE WENT ON A FIELD
TRIP TO LANGLEY WHICH WAS
SUPERCOOL.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: A FIELD TRIP.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: WERE THERE
SNACKS.
WAS THERE ANYTHING, ANY
QUESTIONS BETWEEN BIPOLAR
BEHAVIOR AND SORT OF THE
INHERENT PARANOIA THAT IS
NECESSARY FOR SPY WORK.
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THAT LOOK, IT'S VERY
LONELY TO BE A CIA OFFICER
AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
QUITE LONELY TO BE BIPOLAR.
>> Stephen: CLAIRE, CLAIRE.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IS IT LONELY TO
BE CLAIRE DANES?
(LAUGHTER)
AGAIN THIS IS A SAFE SPACE.
>> NO, NOT CRIPPLINGLY SO,
NOT YET.
>> Stephen: CAN I CRITICIZE
YOU FOR A SECOND.
>> YES, PLEASE.
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW, THIS
SHOW AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
12 EPISODES SO FAR.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: NO ENHANCED
INTERROGATION.
SO ENHANCED INTERROGATION.
THAT'S HOW THE CIA LEARNS
THINGS, THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW.
WHY, WHY, YOU ARE AN
ACTRESS.
DON'T YOU HAVE AN URGE TO
IMPRO ADVICE AND STUFF A WET
RAG IN SOMEONE'S MOUTH AT
ANY POINT.
>> I ACTUALLY LEARNED
THEY'RE NOT EVEN CALLED
INTERROGATIONS ANY MORE,
THEY'RE CALLED INTERVIEWS.
BECAUSE INTERROGATIONS IS
TOO PEJORATIVE.
>> Stephen: OH REALLY.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THEY SHOULD CALL
THEM-- WELL, CLAIRE DANES,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
CLAIRE DANES, HOMELAND, ON
SHOWTIME, CHECK IT OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
