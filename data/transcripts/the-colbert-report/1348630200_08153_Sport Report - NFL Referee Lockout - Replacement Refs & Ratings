>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!
LATER IN MY SHOW TONIGHT MY GUEST WILL BE CLARESSA SHIELDS, THE FIRST-EVER FEMALE OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST IN BOXING.
THAT IS MY DREAM JOB!
(LAUGHTER) TRAVELING THE WORLD PUNCHING FOREIGNERS IN THE FACE.
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, A COUPLE WEEKS BACK I BROKE THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE N.F.L. OWNERS LOCKED OUT ITS
UNION REFEREES AND IS NOW USING REPLACEMENTS FROM DIVISION 3 COLLEGE FOOTBALL, HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL, AND, I BELIEVE,
EUROPEAN FOOTBALL.
(LAUGHTER) IN FACT, IN THE LAST WEEK'S JETS/DOLPHINS GAME, BOTH TEAMS GOT A YELLOW CARD FOR USING THEIR HANDS.
(LAUGHTER) THE N.F.L. IS ALSO USING SEVERAL REFEREES THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY FIRED BY THE LINGERIE LEAGUE FOR
ON FIELD INCOMPETENT OFFICIATING.
(LAUGHTER) FOR SOME REASON, AFTER EVERY DOWN THEY HAD TO WATCH THE SLOW MOTION REPLAY.
(LAUGHTER) BUT NOW THESE REPLACEMENT REFS ARE GETTING FLAK JUST BECAUSE THEIR INNOCENT MISTAKES ARE
DETERMINING THE OUTCOMES OF GAMES!
(LAUGHTER) JUST LISTEN TO FOX NEWS' THE BROWN HAIRED GUY WHO'S NOT STEVE DOOCY.
>> THE CALLS TO BRING BACK REGULAR N.F.L. REFS SURE TO HEAT UP AFTER LAST NIGHT'S GAME.
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS SHOW YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T WATCH THIS GAME.
WOULD THEY COMPLETE THIS PASS?
THE REFS SAY SO.
THE PACKERS SCORED IF THE INTERCEPTION REALLY IN MY MIND.
>> Stephen: ALSO IN MS. MIND, PANCAKES.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, PEOPLE ARE PISSED!
INCLUDING THE PACKERS GUARD T.J.
LANG TWEETED "GOT (BLEEP)ED BY THE REFS.
EMBARRASSING.
THANKS N.F.L.
".
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND BELIEVE ME, THE PACKERS KNOW EMBARRASSING.
(LAUGHTER) THIS CALL UPSET EVEN UNION-BUSTING GOVERNOR AND PACKER FAN SCOTT WALKER WHO TWEETED "AFTER CATCHING A FEW
HOURS OF SLEEP, THE PACKERS GAME IS STILL JUST AS PAINFUL" ADDING THE HASHTAG "RETURN THE REAL REFS."
NOW, I CAN SEE WHY HE WANTS THE UNION REFS BACK.
I MEAN, CRUSHING THE TEACHERS UNION IS FINE, BUT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MONEY ON THAT GAME!
WELL, SORRY, GOVERNOR WALKER, BUT THE N.F.L.'S NUMBERS ARE AGAINST YOU BECAUSE T.V. RATINGS ARE AT RECORD HIGHS.
SUNDAY NIGHT'S RATINGS WERE UP 8% OVER A YEAR AGO WHICH MEANS THE FREE MARKET HAS SPOKEN!
THAT WAS A GREAT CALL!
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE APPARENTLY PEOPLE ARE TUNING IN JUST TO SEE TERRIBLE CALLS!
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST WORST CALLS IN FOOTBALL HISTORY.
(LAUGHTER) RIGHT UP THERE WITH BRETT FAVRE PRESSING "SEND." (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE-- THEY LOVE IT.
PEOPLE LOVE SPORTS DISASTERS.
THAT'S WHY THEY WATCH NASCAR OR THE METS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) I SAY THE N.F.L. SHOULD INCORPORATE OTHER THINGS THAT ENTERTAININGLY RUIN THE GAME.
FOR INSTANCE, STOP MOWING THE GRASS.
(LAUGHTER) OR IF YOU MUST MOW IT, MAKE THE GROUND CREW SPEND 20 MINUTES IN A GYROSCOPE BEFORE THEY PAINT
THE LINES ON THE FIELD.
(LAUGHTER) AND MAYBE SWAP OUT THE UPRIGHTS FOR THOSE WAVY CAR DEALERSHIP GUYS.
(APPLAUSE) SO I SAY LET THE LOCKOUT CONTINUE!
THESE REPLACEMENT REFS ARE GREAT FOR BUSINESS!
(LAUGHTER) I JUST HOPE THEY'RE DEMANDING TO GET PAID WHAT THEY'RE WORTH.
I MEAN, IF THE OWNERS DON'T GIVE IT TO THEM, THEY SHOULD REALLY FORM A UNION.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
