STILL STUCK IN A RUT.
NOT ONLY, THAT IT'S FOUR MONTHS
BEHIND ON ITS RUT PAYMENT, SO
WHILE YOU STILL HAVE
ELECTRICITY, IT'S UP TO ME TO
HELP YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE
SOME MONEY.
I MAY NOT HAVE MASTERS IN
ECONOMICS, BUT I'VE GOT
SOMETHING BETTER, A GIANT RED
BUTTON.
IT WILL TELL YOU HOW THE MAKE
ENDS MEET.
SELL YOUR CORNEAS.
THIS IS "BEARS AND BALLS."
FIRST UP, FOLKS, I AM A STRONG
BELIEVER IN BUYING AMERICAN-MADE
PRODUCTS.
THAT'S WHY I URGE YOU TO INVEST
IN -- TO CONTINUE IN ENGLISH,
PRESS ONE.
OKAY.
TO CONTINUE IN ESPANOL, NUMERO
DOS.
AMERICAN APPAREL.
YES, THE MOST RED, WHITE AND
BLUE COMPANY EVER STARTED BY A
CA NAIDIAN.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS HORRIBLE
NEWS.
>> LOS ANGELES-BASED AMERICAN
APPAREL IS ON THE BRINK OF
BANKRUPTCY.
THE RETAILER WARNS IT MAY NOT
REMAIN IN BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: WE CANNOT LET THIS
HAPPEN, FOLKS.
THIS IS OUR NATIONAL APPAREL.
THESE ARE THE TANK TOPS AND
HALTER ROMPERS OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS WORE.
AND IF THIS BANKRUPTCY GOES
THROUGH, THE ONLY PLACE YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO BUY SOLID-COLORED
T-SHIRTS IS EVERYWHERE ELSE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IF THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS,
IT'S AS IF THEY EXPLOITED ALL
THOSE YOUNG GIRLS FOR NOTHING.
WITHOUT THEM... MY GOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW CAN THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS?
I THOUGHT SEX SELLS, AND I
BELIEVE SHE WAS [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUSINESS AT
ALL.
WITHOUT THIS AMERICAN COMPANY,
WE'LL BE FORCED TO BUY CLOTHES
FROM FORD -- FOREIGN COUNTRIES
LIKE MONACO OR ONE OF THE BANANA
REPUBLICS OR THAT AREA BETWEEN
COUNTRIES, THE GAP.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE...
INVESTING IN INDIVIDUAL
COMPANIES IS FINE, BUT IF YOU
REALLY WANT TO GO FOR THE GOLD,
YOU SHOULD SHANGHAI A PIRATE.
NO.
RUPEE A HELP A KAHN.
>>NO.
CORNER A MARKET.
THAT'S RIGHT.
CORNER A MARKET.
NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN
LAST LIVING OOMPA-LOOMPA ANTHONY
WARD.
>> ANTHONY WARD BOUGHT 241,000
TONS OF EUROPE'S COCOA BEANS.
THE BEANS COULD FILL FIVE SHIPS
THE SIZE OF THE "TITANIC."
>> Stephen: JUST THINK, IF IT
HIT AN ICEBERG, WHAT A
MOUTH-WATERING TRAGEDY.
AND AS "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
REPORTS, WARD PURCHASES HAVE
EVEN EARNED HIM THE NICKNAME,
"CHOCOLATE FINGER."
HE IS THE MAN, THE MAN WITH THE
CARR MEL CRUNCH.
HE LOVES TO MUNCH.
I CAN ONLY ASSUME HIS SECRETARY
IS NAMED PUSSY S'MORES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE MAN
BREAKS OFF A HUGE PIECE OF THE
WORLD'S IT KIT KAT BAR?
>> HE'S REPORTED TO HAVE PUSHED
COCOA PRICES TO A RECORD HIGH.
>> Stephen: OR AS ONE ANALYST
PUT IT, THE MARKET WENT CUCKOO.
BUT THIS IS A GREAT INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITY, FOLKS.
WHEN PEOPLE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD
CHOCOLATE, THEY'LL REACH FOR
NEXT BEST THING.
REGRETTABLE SEX.
NO.
DIANETICS.
NO.
CHOCOLATY.
YES.
CHOCOLATY.
YOU SEE, COCO IS EXPENSIVE, AND
SINCE THE F.D.A. REQUIRES ANY
PRODUCT CALLED "CHOCOLATE" TO
CONTAIN COCOA, MANY CALL THEIR
PRODUCTS "CHOCOLATY," PLUS IT
SOUNDS MORE APPETIZING THAN
BROWN.
BY THE WAY, DO NOT EAT BROWN
CRISPIES.
THAT'S WHY... THAT'S WHY MY
BUTTON AND I ARE RECOMMENDING
CORNERING THE MARKET ON
CHEMICALS THAT PRODUCE RICH,
CHOCOLATY GOODNESS LIKE
POLYGLOSS NOL, A YELLOWISH
POLY-CONDENSED FATTY ACIDS FROM
CASTOR OIL.
MMMM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMMM.
JUST LIKE MOM USED TO EMULSIFY.
TAKE MY ADVICE AND SOON EVERYONE
IN THE MEDIA WILL BE CALLING YOU
POLYGLICEROL FINGER.
HE IS THE MAN, THE MAN WITH THE
FATTY ACID TOUCH.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE...
[LAUGHTER]
THE MAN WITH THE FATTY ACID
TOUCH IS A TITLE CURRENTLY HELD
BY KARL ROVE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO THAT'S IT FOR "BEARS AND
BONES."
REMEMBER TO TUNE IN NEXT TIME
WHEN I TELL YOU THE BEST PLACE
TO REINVEST YOUR MONEY.
GUNS.
NO.
I SAID GUNS.
NO.
