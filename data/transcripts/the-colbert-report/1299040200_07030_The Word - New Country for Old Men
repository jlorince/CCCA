EVERYBODY KEEPS SAYINGTHE MIDDLE-CLASS IS AN
ENDANGERED SPECIES AND YET NOTONE OF THEM HAS SIGNED UP FOR MY
CAPTIVE BREEDING PROGRAM.
ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDYPUBLISHED IN "MOTHER JONES"
MAGAZINE-- I JUST BUY IT FOR THEPICTURES OF 2 MOTHERS-- THERE'S
A STARTLING DISPARITY IN THEDISTRIBUTION OF AMERICA'S
WEALTH.
IT'S EASIEST TO ILLUSTRATE WITHA PIE CHART.
OR, BETTER YET, A PIE-EATINGCONTEST.
YOU SEE, THE TOP 1% WEALTHIESTAMERICANS GOBBLE UP MORE THAN A
THIRD OF AMERICA'S NET WORTH.
AND THE TOP 10% CHOW DOWN ONALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF THE
MONEY, LEAVING THE BOTTOM 90%WITH WHATEVER'S LEFT.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED "TRICKLE
DOWN."
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)STILL THIS IS A DISTURBING TREND
THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'SWORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NEW COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.
FOLKS, AS I SEE IT, THERE ARETHREE WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS
PROBLEM.
FIRST, WE COULD DO NOTHING.
ALWAYS MY TOP CHOICE.
WE JUST LET THE INCOME DISPARITYKEEP GROWING.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT'S BAD FOR DEMOCRACYTHAT THE VAST MAJORITY WHO HAVE
LITTLE HAVE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRYWHERE THE AVERAGE C.E.O. MAKES
185 TIMES MORE THAN THE AVERAGEWORKER.
NOW, FOLKS, I SAY THAT LEADS TOWORKER DISCONTENT AND THOSE ARE
THE SEEDS OF REVOLUTION.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, WE COULD TRY REDISTRIBUTION
OF WEALTH: RAISE TAXES ON THERICH, LIMIT EXECUTIVE PAY.
BUT, FOLKS, THAT IS CLASSWARFARE.
AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TRIED THATBEFORE AND AS WARREN BUFFETT
WOULD SAY "MY CLASS WON."
(LAUGHTER)I THINK THAT THERE IS A SIMPLER
SOLUTION.
REMEMBER JOHN EDWARDS CAMPAIGNCATCH PHRASE FROM 2008?
>> THERE ARE TWO AMERICAS.
ONE AMERICA THAT DOES THE WORKAND ANOTHER THAT REAP IT IS
REWARDS.
>> I REALIZE NOW THAT JOHNEDWARDS WAS RIGHT.
YOU SEE, A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE"ATLANTIC" MAGAZINE POINTS OUT
THAT THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANSARE NOW PART OF A NEW
INTERNATIONAL ELITE, ATRANSGLOBAL COMMUNITY OF PEERS
WHO HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITHEACH OTHER THAN WITH THEIR
COUNTRYMEN BACK HOME.
YOU SIGH, A REALLY RICH AMERICANAND A REALLY RICH SAUDI THAN A
REALLY RICH AMERICAN AND THE 99%OF OTHER AMERICANS-- UNLESS THE
CONVERSATION IS "STEP BACK FROMMY ELECTRIFIED FENCE."
(LAUGHTER)NOW, TIME WAS FOLKS...
(AUDIENCE REACTS)TIME WAS WE WEALTHY AMERICANS
NEEDED THE REST OF YOU TO WORKIN OUR FACTORIES AND BUY THE
PRODUCTS MADE BY OTHERAMERICANS.
ASK YOUR GRANDPA ABOUT IT.
BUT NOW...
(LAUGHTER)THE WEALTHY OWNERS OWN FACTORIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD AND CAN HIRENON-AMERICANS TO WORK FOR
PENNIES.
AND, FOLKS, LET'S FACE IT WE'VESEEN THIS COMING A LONG TIME.
JUST LOOK AT AVERAGE INCOMESOVER THE LAST 30 YEARS.
THE RED LINE REPRESENTS THE TOP1% OF AMERICANS AND THE FLACCID
RAINBOW AT THE BOTTOM IS ALL YOUPEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT CAN I SAY?
SOMETIMES INCOME BRACKETS JUSTDRIFT APART.
(LAUGHTER)OVER THE YEARS WE'VE JUST
DEVELOPED DIFFERENT INTERESTS.
WE'RE INTO FINE RAINS AND RACINGBUGATTIS AND YOU'RE INTO
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE SHELTERAND WARMTH.
(LAUGHTER)SO IF... IF THERE REALLY IS A
RICH AMERICA AND A POOR AMERICAI SAY WHY NOT MAKE IT OFFICIAL?
LET THE RICH START THEIR OWNCOUNTRY.
CALL IT AMERICA PLUS!
I MEAN, WE ALREADY LIVE IN GATEDCOMMUNITIES.
I SAY WE JUST CONNECT THEM ALLWITH REALLY LONG DRIVEWAYS.
TO VISIT YOU JUST NEED A GREENCARD.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)NOW, DON'T WORRY, WE WILL STILL
MAINTAIN NORMAL DIPLOMATICRELATIONS WITH POOR AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER)LUCKILY, MOST OF THE GOVERNMENT
INSTITUTIONS WE RICH WILL NEEDARE ALREADY IN PLACE.
AFTER ALL, NEARLY HALF OFCONGRESS IS MILLIONAIRES.
SO THEY'RE GOING WITH US.
BEST OF ALL, WHEN WE'VE GOTAMERICA PLUS IN PLACE, THE
ECONOMY OF YOUR COUNTRY WILLFINALLY GET MOVING.
BECAUSE TO US YOU'LL NOW BECHEAP FOREIGN LABOR AND WE MIGHT
JUST START HIRING YOU AGAIN.
AND THAT'S THE WORD WE'LL BERIGHT BACK.
