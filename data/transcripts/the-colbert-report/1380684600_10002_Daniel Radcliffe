WRITERS IN THE 20th CENTURY.
THAT KIND OF SCHOOL OF THOUGHTWAS THAT THEY COULD -- IT WAS
QUITE A -- THEY TOOK EXCITEMENTIN THE NIHILISM OF WHAT THEY
WERE DOING AND THE IDEA OFTEARING EVERYTHING DOWN THAT HAD
GONE BEFORE AND STARTING FRESHLIKE THIS WAS YEAR ONE.
>> Stephen: THEY WEREANTI-AMERICAN, REALLY.
THEY WERE ANTI-AMERICAN.
NO, THEY WERE!
BECAUSE THEY WERE QUESTIONINGTHE MORAL AND SOCIAL ORDER WITH
THEIR WORK.
>> BUT THAT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT?
ISN'T IT GOOD TO QUESTIONTHINGS.

BECAUSE IT WAS THE 1950s.
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.
EISENHOWER, EVERYONE WASSTRAIGHT, WHITE, AND MALE.
