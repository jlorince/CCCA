MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW ALBUM
CALLED "NATIONAL RANSOM," WHOSE
LYRICS I ASSUME HE WROTE WITH
LETTERS CUT OUT FROM MAGAZINES.
PLEASE WELCOME ELVIS COSTELLO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
ELVIS.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M REALLY WELL.
THANKS.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M DOING BETTER THAN LAST
TIME I WAS HERE.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD BARELY
TALK LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE.
I HAD TO DO ALL THE TALKING,
WHICH WAS RARE.
>> AND THE SINGING.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW
ALBUM.
"NATIONAL RANSOM."
BY NATIONAL, WHAT NATION ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU TALKING ABOUT AMERICA?
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT AMERICA?
>>LITTLE BIT?
OKAY.
>> I THINK I'LL GO BACK TO BEING
MUTE.
>> Stephen: YOU SHOULD BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE AN AMERICAN
ACCENT.
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE A GUY WITH A
FOREIGN ACCENT TALKING ABOUT MY
COUNTRY.
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT?
WHAT RANSOM ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
>> THE ONE WE'RE HOLDING
OURSELVES TO.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE JUST TOOK OUR COUNTRY BACK.
THERE WAS HOSTAGE SITUATION
GOING ON AND WE STORMED THE
BRUCE.
>> IT WAS PRESCIENT OF ME TO
CALL IT "NATIONAL RANSOM"
KNOWING...
>> SO THIS IS A TEA PARTY ALBUM?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A BRIT.
A TEA PARTY IS NATURAL FOR YOU.
>> IT'S SECOND NATURE
>> Stephen: LET'S LOOK AT THE
COVER.
ELVIS COSTELLO.
YOU HAVE A RICH WOLF RUNNING
AWAY FROM A BURNING PYRAMID AND
SOME FLAMES AND OIL SPEWING OUT.
I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB
AND SAY THIS IS NOT THE MOST
CAPITALIST ALBUM IN THE WORLD.
ARE YOU CRITICIZING THE CAPITAL
SYSTEM?
>> LETS R PUT IT THIS WAY: IF
YOU HAD IN MEDIEVAL TIMES
PROPOSED A SYSTEM OF CURRENCY
BASED ON A NEGATIVE VALUE, THEY
WOULD HAVE BURNED YOU AS A
WITCH.
>> Stephen: A SYSTEM OF
CURRENCY... I BELIEVE YOU'RE
COVERING YOUR MIC.
A SYSTEM OF CURRENCY.
I'M IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S OKAY.
I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT YOU
SAID FOR THE LAST THREE MINCING.
THIS IS WHERE THE MONEY IS.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU MEAN A SYSTEM
OF CURRENCY BASED ON A NEGATIVE
VALUE?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
>> Stephen: I DON'T.
I DON'T.
>> LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU.
IF PEOPLE TRADE IN SOMETHING
REAL LIKE GOLD, WE CAN SAY
FEATHERS ARE THE RARE THING AND
FEATHERS BECOME CENTRAL USABLE
AND THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY
BIRDS.
>> Stephen: TULIPS.
>> WE COULD TRADE IN TULIPS.
IN FACT, PEOPLE DID, POPPIES AND
IN OPIUM AND...
>> Stephen: THEY STILL DO.
>> THEY STILL DO, YES.
AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE REALM
OF ALCHEMY AND YOU SAY,
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST AT
ALL HAS COMPLETELY NEGATIVE
VALUE.
>> Stephen: LIKE THE DOLLAR,
THE ALMIGHTY GREENBACK.
I GOT A LOT OF THOSE.
ARE YOU SAYING THEY'RE NOT WORTH
ANYTHING?
>> THE ORIGINAL PICTURE WE HAD
WAS A WOLF PUSHING A BIG WHEEL
BARREL FULL OF MONEY LIKE THEY
USED TO HAVE IN GERMANY.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU POLITICAL
GUY?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: THIS SEEMS LIKE A
POLITICAL THING.
YOU RECENTLY CANCELED AN
APPEARANCE IN ISRAEL AND TOOK
YOUR NAME OFF OF IT.
ARE YOU ONE OF THESE FOLK
SINGERS WHO PROTESTS THINGS?
>> I PROTEST THINGS, YES.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
IF THEY'RE SO TIRED OF
PROTESTING THAT THEY HARDLY
MENTION IT.
YOU WROTE YOURSELF IN TOKYO
STORM WARNLING.
SO ARE YOU JUST MARGINALIZING
YOURSELF BY BEING A PROTEST
SINGER?
>> I HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY TRYING
TO DRIVE THE RECORD BUSINESS OUT
OF BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IN GENERAL.
>> THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE...
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
HERE.
ARE YOU READY FOR THE COLBERT
BUMP?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WELL, LET'S DO A
SONG.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
HOW ABOUT YOU DO A SONG, HOW
ABOUT THAT?
AND THEN MAYBE LET'S DO A SONG.
>> YOU AND ME?
>> WHY NOT?
