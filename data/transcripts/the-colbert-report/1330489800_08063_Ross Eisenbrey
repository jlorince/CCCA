>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LAWYER
FIGHTING AGAINST UNPAID
INTERNSHIPS.
BUT IF ANY OF MY INTERNS ASK
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF
UZBEKISTAN.
PLEASE WELCOME ROSS EISENBREY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THRILLED TO BE HERE SIR, GIVE
THE PEOPLE YOUR CV.
YOU ARE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF
ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE, A
LAWYER, FORMER COMMISSIONER OF
U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND
HEALTH REVIEW COMMISSION.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN A 1,000 WORD
ARTICLE THAT SAYS INTERNS ARE A
SCOURGE ON THE LABOR MARKET.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST
INTERNS, SIR?
>> THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID.
>> STEPHEN: YOU SAID THEY ARE
A SCOURGE.
INTERNS ARE WONDERFUL.
UNPAID INTERNSHIPS WHERE THEY
WORK FOR NOTHING THAT IS A VERY
BAD THING.
>> STEPHEN: SHHHH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I HAVE AN INTERN HERE, JAY.
JAY, THE INTERN.
HE HAS BEEN HERE FOR SIX AND A
HALF YEARS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THINK OF ALL THE COLLEGE CREDITS
HE IS RACKING UP.
HE IS HALFWAY TO HIS Ph.D.
>> HE PROBABLY HAS TO PAY FOR
THOSE CREDITS SO HE IS GETTING A
DOUBLY BAD DEAL.
HE IS NOT GETTING PAID FOR HIS
WORK AND PAGE FOR AN ACADEMIC
EXPERIENCE HE IS NOT GETTING
BECAUSE HE IS NOT IN CLASS.
HE IS NOT IN COLLEGE.
>> STEPHEN: HE IS IN THE
SCHOOL OF LIFE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE IS LEARNING THAT SOMETIMES
YOU CAN BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: BEAL AGREE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT HE'S BEEN TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
WE SHOULD BE PAYING THE INTERNS?
>> ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR SOMEONE
ELSE FOR THEIR FINANCIAL BENEFIT
SHOULD BE PAID FOR THEIR WORK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AS A MATTER OF FACT -- IT'S
AGAINST THE LAW.
>> STEPHEN: COLLEGE ATHLETES
SHOULD BE PAID.
>> YEAH, PROBABLY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH, THEY --
>> STEPHEN: COLLEGE ATHLETES
SHOULD BE PAID.
>> THEY TAKE TREMENDOUS RISKS.
THEY GET HURT.
>> STEPHEN: EVERYONE IN THE
OLYMPICS SHOULD BE PAID.
>> WELL, NO.
ARE THEY --
>> STEPHEN: PEOPLE ARE
PROFITING, ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE ARE
PROFITING OFF THE OLYMPICS.
I'M JUST SAYING BEING MY INTERN
IS LIKE BEING IN THE OLYMPICS IN
THAT I MAKE YOU RUN EVERYWHERE
YOU GO.
>> I BELIEVE THEY TRAIN VERY
HARD FOR THIS.
>> STEPHEN: YOU ARE LIKE THE
ABRAHAM LINCOLN OF INTERNS YOU
WANT TO LET MY PEOPLE GO.
>> THINK HOW MUCH BETTER THEIR
EXPERIENCE WOULD BE IF YOU PAID
THEM.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT THE
LOVE OF THE GAME.
MAYBE THERE ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS
WHO JUST REALLY WANT TO GET ME
COFFEE.
>> THERE PROBABLY ARE BUT YOU
KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WORK FOR FREE,
EMPLOYERS GET THE IDEA THAT THEY
DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR LABOR.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU AND!3BSAY S
WIT, CAN I GET AWAY WITH IT.
I WON'T PAY ALL THE ENTRY LEVEL
PEOPLE WHO COME TO WORK FOR ME.
>> STEPHEN: HOW IS IT BAD FOR
THE ECONOMY.
THE GUY NOT PAYING ANYBODY IS
MAKING A PRFT.
>> YES, MAKING BIGGER AND BIGGER
PROFITS AND MORE AND MORE
INEQUALITY NOW THAT WE'VE EVER
HAD OUR EXPERIENCE.
IF THE INTERNS FEEL LIKE THEY
ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WHY
DON'T THEY GET INTERNS OF THEIR
OWN.
>> THERE ARE INTERNS WHO ARE
UNPAID WHO ARE COORDINATING
OTHER INTERNS.
THERE'S A BIG LAWSUIT OVER THAT
INVOLVING HARPAR'S BAAZAR.
>> STEPHEN: HAVE YOU EVER HAD
INTERN?
>> WE'VE HAD INTERNS.
>> STEPHEN: DID YOUv: PAY THEM?
>> WE DID PAY THEM.
>> STEPHEN: ARE THEY ALWAYS
PAID?
>> YES.
>> WE HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE WE
HAVE FOUNDATION MONEY TO SUPPORT
INTERNSHIPS AT VARIOUS SMALL
THINK TANKS AROUND THE COUNTRY.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IF WE HAD THE
INTERNS PAY INTO A LOTTERY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND ONE OF THEM WON THE LOTTERY.
WE PUT LIKE A DOLLAR IN LIKE A
PILLOW CASE EVERY WEEK AND THEN
EVERY WEEK I WOULD PULL OUT A
DOLOR AND WRITE YOUR NAME ON IT
AND SAY IT'S JAY, IT'S DAVE.
WHATEVER.
THEY WERE PAYING EACH OTHER.
>> THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE LAW
TOO.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS WITH THE
LAW OF PAYING PEOPLE.
I KNOW TO PAY PEOPLE.
WE DON'T NEED ANY LAWS THAT
EVERYBODY ALREADY OBEYS NL YOU
ARE LEARNING FROM YOUR STATE
REPRESENTATIVES.
I SEE THAT.
NO, REALLY IT'S A SERIOUS
PROBLEM THERE ARE NOW -- THE
INTERNSHIP THING HAS GOTTEN SO
OUT OF CONTROL THE NOTION THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE WHO
WORK FOR YOU.
THERE ARE 42-YEAR-OLD
ACCOUNTANTS WORKING FOR FOX
SEARCHLIGHT FILMS WHO ARE NOT
PAID.
>> STEPHEN: 42-YEAR-OLD
COLLEGE STUDENTS?
>> AN EMPLOYER CAN CALL YOU AN
INTERN AND NOT PAY YOU.
>> STEPHEN: WE HAD THAT IN THE
SOUTH 150 YEARS AGO, A COTTON
INTERNSHIP.
WE HAVE INTERN HERE'S.
DAVE IS ONE OF OUR INTERNS THIS
SEMESTER.
HE IS MY HOST INTERN.
HE IS TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE
CAREER OF BEING ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE LET THEM STAY INVOLVED IN THE
SHOW.
WE GIVE THEM EXPERIENCE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY INTERNSHIPS?
>> STEPHEN: ARE YOU
INTERESTED.
WE DO.
>> ARE THEY PAID?
THEY ARE BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT COMIB AS PUBLIC
POLICY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- SOMETHING ABOUT ECONOMICS AND
PUBLIC POLICY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING
