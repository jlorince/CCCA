EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CK,
FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A
NEW INTERVIEW SHOW CALLED
"MOYERS AND COMPANY."
I HOPE THAT MEANS HE'S
INTERVIEWING CORPORATIONS.
PLEASE WELCOME BILL MOYERS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MR. MOYERS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU.
>> SAME HERE.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELL, I HAVE ENJOYED YOUR WORK
EVER SINCE THE JOSEPH CAMPBELL
INTERVIEWS YOU DID.
>> 25 YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: 25 YEARS AGO.
THAT'S HOW I FOUND OUT THEY WAS
THE HERO WITH 1,000 FACES.
NOW, SIR, WE'VE GOT THE
PLEASANTRIES OUT OF THE WAY.
IT'S HAMMER TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
>> HAMMER AWAY.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE OFTEN
CONSIDERED LIKE THE REASONABLE
MAN'S REASONABLE MAN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
YOU KEEP A CALM VOICE.
YOU NEVER ATTACK THE GUESTS ON
YOUR SHOWS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M HERE TO CALL BULL
[BLEEPED].
OKAY.
IT'S ALL AN ACT.
YOU SANDBAG AND SHIFT PEOPLE
WITH CALMNESS AND FACTS.
HOW IS THAT ANY BETTER THAN WHAT
I DO?
>> YOU'RE FROM THE SOUTH.
YOU MUST KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A HOOT OWL AND A SCROOCH
OWL.
THE HOOT OWL CRASHES INTO THE
HEN HOUSE, KNOCKS THE HEN OFF
THE PERCH, CATCHES IT.
THE SCOOCH OWL COMES IN QUIETLY,
GEMMILY, SNUGGLES UP NEXT TO THE
HEN, STARTS TALKING GENTLY TO
THE HEN.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THERE
AIN'T NO HEN.
I PREFER THAT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I WOULD LIKE THE
SEE YOU AND DAN RATHER IN A
FOLKSY-OFF.
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
TAKE HIM.
YOU USED TO HAVE A SHOW CALL
"BILL MOYERS JOURNAL" FIRST IN
THE '70s AND THEN FROM 2007 TO
2010.
THEN YOU HAD "NOW WITH
BILL
Moyers."
YOU WERE A SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO
PRESIDENT JOHNSON, INCLUDING TWO
YEARS AS THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS
SECRETARY.
WHEN YOU WERE PRESS SECRETARY,
DID YOU AT ANY MOMENT WITHHOLD
INFORMATION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
PEACE CORPSES OR DID ST. MOYERS
ALWAYS GO WITH THE TRUTH?
>> I USED TO HOLD INFORMATION
FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THAT'S MUCH MORE DANGEROUS.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
YOU'RE THE REASON VIETNAM
FAILED.
YOU WOULD JUST TOLD HIM IT WAS A
QUAGMIRE, I'M SURE JOHNSON WOULD
HAVE PULLED HIM OUT.
>> OUR CREDIBILITY WAS IS BAD WE
COULDN'T BELIEVE OUR OWN LEAKS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: I LIKE THE OWL ONE
BETTER.
OKAY.
SO NOW YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW
CALLED "MOYERS AND COMPANY."
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS THE NEW
SHOW?
>> IT'S A LOOK AT AMERICA
THROUGH THE EXPERIENCES OF A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T MAKE IT ON
MOST TELEVISION SHOWS, FOR
EXAMPLE, "THIS THIS WEEK I HAVE THE
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON
OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, JACOB
PACKER OF YALE AND PAUL PIERCE
TALKING ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON
SERVED THE RICH IN THE LAST 30
YEARS AND TURNED ITS BACK ON THE
MIDDLE CLASS.
>> Stephen: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DON'T YOU MEAN THE CREATIVE
CLASS?
YOU MEAN THEY HAVE SERVED THE
JOB CREATORS OF THIS COUNTRY, OR
DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT WE NEED
CAPITALISM TO CREATE JOBS?
>> ABSOLUTELY DO, BUT CAPITALISM
IS OUT OF CONTROL THANKS IN NO
SMALL PART TO CITIZENS UNITED,
THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT
SAID THAT A CORPORATION IS A
PERSON, EVEN THOUGH I DOESN'T
EAT, DRINK, MAKE LOVE, SING,
RAISE CHILDREN OR TAKE CARE OF
AGING PARENTS.
YOU CANNOT HAVE A PEOPLE'S
DEMOCRACY AS LONG AS
CORPORATIONS ARE CONSIDERED
PEOPLE.
THEY'RE JUST PRIVATE
INSTITUTIONS.
>> Stephen: DO YOU
UNDERSTAND... DO YOU
UNDERSTAND...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
EXCUSE ME.
GIVE ME TIME TO NAIL HIM FIRST.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SOUND
LIKE A RACIST.
THAT SOUTHERN ACCENT IS NOT
HELPING YOU.
OKAY.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT SOME PEOPLE,
BECAUSE CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN
PEOPLE SINCE 1886, SANTA CLARA,
SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD.
AM I GOING TOO FAST FOR YOU,
DAD.
AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT SOME
PEOPLE JUST AREN'T PEOPLE IN THE
EYES OF BILL MOYERS?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: OH, YEAH, SURE.
LET ME ASK YOU, DO ANY OF THESE
"NOT PEOPLE" FUND YOUR SHOW,
BILL?
>> ONE OF THEM WHO IS FULL OF
GOOD PEOPLE FUNDS MY SHOW.
MUTUAL OF AMERICA HAS BEEN MY
SOLE CORPORATE FUNDER FOR 25
YEARS.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE BITING THAT
HAND THAT FUNDS YOU.
>> THEY DON'T SEEM TO COMPLAIN.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHERE POLITICS IS GOING IN THE
UNITED STATES.
YOU SAY CORPORATIONS HAVE UNDUE
INFLUENCE OVER OUR GOVERNMENT,
TRUE?
>> TRUE.
>> THEY TONE GOVERNMENT.
>> Stephen: THEY DON'T OWN THE
GOVERNMENT.
THEY JUST EXPRESS THEIR OPINION
THROUGH THE SPEECH THAT IS CASH.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
AGAIN, THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF
THE CITIZENS UNITED RULING.
MONEY EQUALS SPEECH.
I'VE GOT SOME GREAT NEWS FOR
CORPORATIONS' RIGHT TO SPEAK
BECAUSE WE JUST GOT THIS IN.
MITT ROMNEY HAS WON THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY.
35.6%.
MITT ROMNEY FAMOUSLY SAID THIS
SUMMER, "CORPORATIONS ARE
PEOPLE," MY FRIEND.
>> A FRIEND OF MINE IN TEXAS
SAID HE WILL BELIEVE
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE WHEN
TEXAS EXECUTES ONE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE RACIST
AND BLOOD THIRSTY.
BILL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BILL MOYERS.
"MOYERS AND COMPANY."
CHECK YOUR LOCAL LISTINGS ON
PUBLIC TELEVISION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
