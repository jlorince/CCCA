>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE RICHER SEX"
WHEN I ASSUMED WAS PICTURES OF WARREN BUFFET AND BILL GATES GOING AT IT.
PLEASE WELCOME LIZA MUNDY.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
YOU'RE A LONGTIME REPORTER OF THE "WASHINGTON POST," OKAY, AND
YOU'RE CURRENTLY A FELLOW AT THE NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION.
NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NEW AMERICA THAT YOU FORESEE.
YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED "THE RICHER SEX-- HOW THE NEW MAJORITY OF FEMALE BREAD
WINNERS IS TRANSFORMING SEX,
LOVE, AND FAMILY." WHAT DO YOU MEAN "THE FEMALE BREAD WINNER."
I'M NOT SAYING THE LADIES SHOULDN'T BE IN THE WORKFORCE
AND THEY DON'T DO A GOOD JOB,
BUT MEN ARE THE BREAD WINNERS TRADITIONALLY.
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL COUNTRY.
>> TRADITIONALLY, YES, BUT INCREASINGLY NOT.
WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE ALMOST 40% OF WORKING WIVES OUT-EARN THEIR HUSBANDS.
WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WOMEN HAVING KIDS AND SUPPORTING THEM AS SINGLE MOMS.
AND WE'RE LOOKING MAYBE IN 20 YEARS, IF THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO ARE OUT-EARNING THEIR
HUSBANDS CONTINUE RISING THE WAY IT HAS BEEN, BY 2030 THAT FIGURE COULD GO OVER 50%.
>> Stephen:  I THOUGHT LADIES ON AVERAGE FOR THE SAME WORK WERE GETTING PAID 70% OF WHAT
MEN WERE BEING PAID.
THAT WAS THE DEAL.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> THERE IS A GENDER WAGE GAP,
AND THAT MEANS IN SOME CASES,
WOMEN ARE SUPPORTING HOUSEHOLDS ON LESS THAN A MAN MIGHT MAKE.
IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO EVEN UP THAT PAY DISPARITY.
>> Stephen:  HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ARE LESS GUYS OUT THERE.
>> TRUE.
>> Stephen:  HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE'RE LOOKING AT A CHANGING ECONOMY, RIGHT,
WHERE INDUSTRIAL JOBS,
HIGH-PAYING INDUSTRIAL JOBS THAT MEN USED TO HAVE --
>> Stephen:  MEN JOBS.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  BLUE COLLAR, BIG WRENCHES, LUNCH BOXES, HARD HATS.
THAT KIND OF STUFF.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  THE KIND OF MEN WHO SHOUT AT WOMEN SAYING HUBBA-HUBBA AS SHE WALKS BY.
>> SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES.
>> Stephen:  OFTEN, OFTEN, SAD TO SAY.
>> THOSE JOBS ARE WAYNEING.
WE'RE MOVING INTO A KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY THAT REWARDS EDUCATED WORKERS.
WOMEN NOW ARE THE EDUCATED SEX.
THEY'RE TAKING ALMOST 60% OF COLLEGE DIPLOMAS.
THEY'RE TAKING THE MAJORITY OF MASTER'S DEGREES, DOCKETTARY DEGREES, ASSOCIATE DEGREES.
>> Stephen:  BUT MEN ALSO GO INTO SUPER, HIGH-POWERED JOBS,
WALL STREET JOBS, THAT KIND OF STUFF.
WOMEN TEND TO-- AND I DON'T MEAN THIS TO BE AN INSULT-- TEND TO TAKE JOBS THAT HELP PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND MEN DON'T GO FOR THOSE AS MUCH, ESPECIALLY AFTER WOMEN TAKE THOSE JOBS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WOMEN KIND OF GHETTOIZE THE JOBS.
>> THAT'S CALLED GENDER POLLUTION.
>> Stephen:  SO THE LADIES GENDER POLLUTE THE JOBS WHERE YOU'RE NICE IN YOUR JOOBZ, AND
FORCES ALL THE MEN TO GO TO WALL STREET WHERE YOU'RE PROFESSIONALLY ( BLEEP ) TO PEOPLE.
>> THAT'S THE CASE.
WOMEN INCREASINGLY ARE GOING INTO PROFESSIONS LIKE LAW AND MEDICINE.
THEY'RE FEMINIZING THOSE PROFESSIONS.
DOCTORS-- DOCTORS,
VETERINARIANS, PSYCHOLOGISTS.
I MEAN, THESE FIELDS HAVE FLIPPED.
>> Stephen:  DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO HAPPEN-- BY GUYS, I MEAN GIRLS.
DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO HAPPEN?
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BITE THIS OFF BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS ROSY AS IT LOOKS.
>> I SAY YES AND NO.
WOMEN HAVE BEEN RAISED TO EXPECT EQUALITY AND PARITY, AND THAT'S
THAT WE'VE BEEN STRIFING FOR,
WORK THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS,
GET PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF WAGES, AND SOMETIMES WHEN WOMEN FIND THEMSELVES PULLING AHEAD IT
CAN BE SURPRISING TO THEM.
WE HAVE A GENERATION OF WOMEN UNDER 30 IN MOST AMERICAN CITIES NOW, WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN ARE
OUT-EARNING THEIR MALE PEERS.
THIS COMES AS A SURPRISE.
YOUNG WOMEN IN COLLEGE ARE OUT-NUMBERING MEN.
THERE ARE MORE WOMEN WITH COLLEGE DEGREES THAN MEN AND THEY'RE HAVING TO ASK
THEMSELVES, "WOULD I MARRY A GUY WHO DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE?"
>> Stephen:  YOUR SUBTITLE SAYS, "HOW IT'S TRANSFORMING
SEX, LOVE, AND FAMILY." WHAT DOES THIS DO IN THE WIEWD WAR.
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE MASKALATING THAN HAVING A WOMAN
WORRY SHE'S EMASCULATING YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> I DID TALK TO WOMEN WHO WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
I INTERVIEWED MORE WOMEN WHO THOUGHT THEIR HUSBANDS WERE EMASCULATED THAN MEN WHO THOUGHT
THEY WERE EMASCULATED.
>> Stephen:  IS THAT WHAT "THE 50 SHADES OF GRAY" IS THE
FANTASY OF THE POWERFUL MAN AND THE NAIVE WOMAN.
>> I HAVE QUITE A BET OF THAT IN THERE.
I HAVE A CHAPTER ON SEX, YES,
YES.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THAT BETWEEN THE SHEETS?
>> WELL, IT CAN-- WHEN IT COMES TO-- AS A SURPRISE TO COUPLES,
WHEN THE WOMAN STARTS BEING MORE SUCCESSFUL, IF THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, WHEN SHE COMES HOME
FROM WORK, SHE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SHE CAN DOWNLOAD THE EVENT OF THE THE DAY OR TALK ABOUT HER
SUCCESS AND IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T TALK ABOUT WHOSE GOING ON, OF COURSE IT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC.
>> Stephen:  OR IF SHE COMES HOME WITH A WAD OF BILLS AND SAYS MAKE IT RAIN.
THAT MIGHT CAUSE A PROBLEM, TOO.
>> OR NOT, OR NOT.
>> Stephen:  TELL YOU WHAT.
TRY IT.
LIZA MUNDY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
