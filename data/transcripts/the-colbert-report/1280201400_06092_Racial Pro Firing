I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.
ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS TO THE
WINNERS.
ANYWAY, AS A RESPONSIBLE PUNDIT,
I KEPT UP WITH ALL THE NEWS YOU
CAN KEPT ON A BOAT WHOSE RADIO
WAS SHORTED OUT WHEN SOMEONE
SPILLED A BUD LIGHT LIME ON IT,
AND IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ME
BECAUSE I WAS PASSED OUT.
[LAUGHTER]
PLEASE.
PLEASE ENJOY RESPONSIBLY.
SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE STORIES
I WAS FOLLOWING DURING THE
BREAK.
DOCTORS REPORT THAT URINE IS A
GREAT WAY TO NEUTRALIZE A
JELLYFISH STING BUT NOT A
FRIEND'S NOSEBLEED.
AND A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT THE
BEST TIME TO TAKE YOUR CHILDREN
OUT FOR ICE CREAM IS WHEN
THEY'RE BEATING YOU IN MONOPOLY.
AND THIS LATE-BREAKING STORY,
SEX ON THE BEACH THE DRINK,
DEEPLY REFRESHING.
SEX ON THE BEACH THE ACTIVITY,
DEEPLY REFINISHING.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THE BIG NEWS...
I'M GOING TO MISS THAT.
THE BIG NEWS OVER MY BREAK WAS
THIS DISTURBING INTERNET VIDEO
OF AN EMPLOYEE AT THE DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE.
NO, NO, NO, JIMMY, NOT THAT
VIDEO.
[LAUGHTER]
THOUGH THAT DOES EXPLAIN THE
TASTE OF FETA CHEESE.
I AM TALKING ABOUT... I AM
TALKING ABOUT THIS DISTURBING
CLIP OF FORMER U.S.D.A. DIRECTOR
OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT SHIRLEY
SHERROD, WHICH WAS POSTED ON THE
CONSERVATIVE WEB SITE
BIGGOVERNMENT.COM.
JIM?
[INAUDIBLE]
HERE I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP A
WHITE PERSON SAVE THEIR LAND.
>> Stephen: THAT IS OFFENSIVE.
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION HAVE NO PLACE IN
GOVERNMENT UNTIL RAND PAUL IS
ELECTED.
THANKFULLY THE CIVIL RIGHTS
LEADERS AT FOX NEWS CALLED A
SPADER.
>> MS. SHERROD MUST RESIGN
IMMEDIATELY.
>> FIRING HER AFTER THAT KIND OF
VICIOUSLY RACIST ATTITUDE WAS
EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> PERHAPS EVERYBODY NEEDS A
REFRESHER COURSE ON WHAT RACISM
LOOKS LIKE.
I MEAN, THAT IS...
>> EXHIBIT A.
>> EXHIBIT A.
>> WELL, TECHNICALLY IT WAS
EXHIBIT "SMALL PART OF WHAT SHE
SAID."
TURNS OUT THAT STATEMENT WAS
TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.
SHERROD'S FULL SPEECH WAS ON
UPLIFTING STORY ABOUT OVERCOMING
THOSE RACIST FEELINGS AND
HELPING THE FARMER.
BUT YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY BLACK
RACISTS ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY
OUR POE-TAW-TOES.
OH, THEY LOVE THEM.
NOW, TO HIS CREDIT WHEN HE
LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DUPED,
PAPA BEAR O'REILLY ISSUED A
GRACIOUS APOLOGY.
>> [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: BUT I
PERSONALLY... MAN'S GOT HEART.
I PERSONALLY... DON'T THINK
ANYONE HAS ANYTHING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR, INCLUDING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION WHY SHERROD WAS
FIRED.
>> THEY ASKED ME TO RESIGN
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON
GLENN BECK TONIGHT:
>> Stephen: SO EVIDENTLY THEY
BELIEVED SHE WAS A RACIST, OR
THEY BELIEVED SHE SOLD GOLD.
NOW, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS
CALLED THIS ZANY CAREER-ENDING
MIX-UP A TEACHABLE MOMENT, AND
IT'S TRUE.
IT HAS TAUGHT US ALL THE
VALUABLE LESSON THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION IS FINALLY SO
SCARED OF RIGHT-WING PUNDITS
THAT IT WILL TAKE SWIFT AND
DECISIVE ACTION ON PROBLEMS THAT
HAVE NO BASIS IN FACT.
THAT IS WHY I AM CALLING ON THE
PRESIDENT TO FIRE MORE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG
BASED ON THESE SHOCKING VIDEOS
THAT I RECENTLY DISCOVERED WERE
SO VERY EASY TO MAKE.
I MEAN, HOW LONG CAN HILLARY
CLINTON KEEP HER JOB AFTER
SEEMING TO SAY THIS:
>> I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
SHOULD BE USING THE INTERNET TO
PROMOTE THE MASS MURDER OF
INNOCENT PEOPLE ACROSS THE
WORLD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE.
SHE IS THE MOST HORRIFYING
GENOCIDAL MANIAC ON THE INTERNET
SINCE CASTS THAT LOOK LIKE
HITLER DOT COM.
[APPLAUSE]
OH, OH, OH.
OH.
ADORABLE.
AND FOLKS, FOLKS, LET'S NOT
FORGET THIS SHOCKING RADIO
INTERVIEW WITH PRESS SECRETARY
ROBERT GIBBS.
>> I'M NOT HERE TO UNFOLD THE
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BANNER.
>> YOU LOOK LIKE A [BLEEPED] IN
HEAT, AND IF YOU GET RAPED BAKE
OF [BLEEPED], IT WILL BE YOUR
FAULT.
>> Stephen: WOW.
I DO NOT THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
ASK HIM BACK ON "WAIT, WAIT,
DON'T TELL ME" ANY TIME SOON.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE JUST SAID
THAT, MAINLY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S OUT THERE NOW ON A
CONSERVATIVE PUNDIT'S SHOW.
WHICH MEANS UNLESS HE WANTS TO
BE CRITICIZED BY CONSERVATIVES,
OBAMA NEEDS TO FIRE ROBERT
GIBBS.
