EVERYBODY.
NATION, AS A KNOWN MEDIA CONTENT
PROVIDER, MY WORDS ARE MY
LIVELIHOOD.
SO WHEN I HEAR ABOUT PUNKS
DOWNLOADING MY SHOW FOR FREE
WITHOUT HAVING TO SIT THROUGH A
CHASE SAPPHIRE AD, IT MAKES ME
FURIOUS, AND NOT JUST AT HER FOR
USING CHASE MILES TO BUY A
DRESS.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO PLEASED TO
LEARN ABOUT ONE SMALL TOWN'S
COURAGEOUS STRUGGLE TO BRING
DOWN A BOOTLEG BUCCANEER.
THIS IS NAIL THEM.
♪♪
PIRATES, ONCE THE SCOURGE OF THE
SEA, NOW THE MENACE OF THE MUSIC
INDUSTRY.
>> PIRACY IS THEFT, CLEAN AND
SIMPLE.
>> Stephen: PILLAGING OUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
TELL 'EM, JOE.
>> IT'S SMASH AND GRAB.
>> IT'S ABOUT MOP AND POP VIDEO
STORES THAT CAN'T SURVIVE
BECAUSE OF PEDLARS ON THE
STREET.
>> I'M FRIENDS WITH A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS AND
HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS, AS WELL,
AND THEY'RE REALLY AGAINST ALL
OF THIS.
>> THEFT, IN EVERY CULTURE,
PEOPLE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE, SHOULD
BE PUNISHED.
>> Stephen: AND HERE ON THE
MEAN STREETS OF WARREN,
MICHIGAN, BOOTLEGGERS HAD BETTER
BEWARE, BECAUSE THIS IS THE
HONORABLE MAYOR JAMES FAUST, AND
SO IS THIS.
AND THE BUCK STOPS RIGHT HERE
FOR ANY WOULD-BE PIRATES.
>> THIS MAYOR IS NOT TOLERANT OF
WHETHER IT BE SMALL CRIME OR
LARGE CRIME.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHY THIS
MAYOR BROUGHT THE HAMMER DOWN ON
THIS MAN.
FRED MERLE, KINGPIN OF WARREN'S
LARGEST PIRACY RING.
>> A RING OF ONE PERSON.
THAT'S ME.
I WAS ARRESTED FOR SELLING POLKA
D.V.D.s.
[POLKA MUSIC PLAYING]
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,
SELLING PIRATED POLKA D.V.D.s,
AN ARREST THAT ROCKED THE POLKA
COMMUNITY.
>> YES, THAT WAS ON TV.
I SAW IT.
>> YEAH, I DID, TOO.
>> A WARREN CITY WORKER IS
BUSTED FOR MAKING SOME FAST CASH
PRODUCING D.V.D.s.
>> AND IN THE PAPER, TOO.
>>AND I WAS SORRY TO HEAR IT.
>> I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID.
I DON'T THINK HE WAS RIGHT.
BUT WHO AM I TO SAY?
I DON'T MOW THE WHOLE FULL
STORY.
>> Stephen: WELL, HERE'S THE
WHOLE FULL STORY.
THE POLKA PARTY, WARREN'S PUBLIC
ACCESS SMASH HIT.
WITH ME IS THE BIG DADDY.
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, DO THE
LAH-DEE-DAH.
>> Stephen: WITH A HUGE
FOLLOWING OF FRENZIED FANS.
>> A LOT OF SHUTIN, PEOPLE IN
NURSING HOME, THEY REALLY ENJOY
IT.
>> ALL THESE POLISH PEOPLE THAT
ARE STUCK IN THE HOUSE, THEY'RE
OLD, THEY LOVE THAT POLKA MUSIC.
>> Stephen: AND FRED LOVES HIS
MASSIVE PIRATING OPERATION.
>> I MEAN, THESE WERE TEN
D.V.D.s THAT I PERSONALLY
OWNED, AND SOMEBODY WANTED THEM,
SO I WAS SELLING IT TO THEM.
>> Stephen: TEN D.V.D.s, AND
HE THOUGHT HE COULD GET AWAY
WITH IT.
WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT HE
WAS TWO-STEPPING RIGHT INTO A
STING OPERATION.
>> I RECEIVED SEVERAL PHONE
CALLS ON MY CELL PHONE ASKING
ABOUT GETTING D.V.D.s OF THE
POLKA PARTY.
I TOLD THEM, YES, IT'S POSSIBLE.
AND HE WAS WILLING TO PICK THEM
UP AT MICHELLE'S RESTAURANT.
SO I TOOK THEM OVER THE
MICHELLE'S, AND I SAT DOWN AT
THE TABLE AND WAITED FOR HIM TO
COME IN.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S WHEN
THE [BLEEPED] WENT DOWN.
OKAY.
AND AFTER THAT IS WHEN THE
[BLEEPED] WENT DOWN.
>> THIS BIG TALL GUY CAME IN.
WHEN I SAW HIM COME OVER TO MY
TABLE, I DID NOT SUSPECT THAT HE
WAS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE
OFFICER.
AND HE CAME OVER AND SAID, "ARE
YOU FRED "MY NAME IS MERLE?"
AND I SAID, "YES, I'M FRED
MERLE."
I GAVE HIM THE PACKAGE OF
D.V.D.s.
HE REACHED IN HIS POCKET AND
PULLED OUT THE CASH.
HE LOOKED AT THEM AND WENT ON
HIS WAY.
>> Stephen: THEY HAD HIM RIGHT
WHERE THEY WANTED HIM.
>> THE NEXT MORNING, FRIDAY
MORNING THE WORK POLICE OFFICERS
ARRIVED AND PUT HANDCUFFS ON.
THEY SAID, "I HAVE WARRANT FOR
YOUR ARREST."
>> Stephen: NAILED, DRAGGED
OFF TO THE POLKA POKEY, AND
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, OR
IT IS?
FRED MERLE'S WIFE SONIA CLAIMS
THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY.
>> MY HUSBAND WAS SET UP.
HE WAS SET UP.
IT WAS A SETUP, A SETUP.
PERIOD.
>> Stephen: BUT IF FRED WAS
SET UP, WHO IN WARREN WAS THE
SETTER UPPER?
ONCE AGAIN SONIA.
>> THE WOMAN, UNFORTUNATELY I
DON'T WANT TO LAUGH, BUT HE'S A
JOKE.
>> Stephen: IF BY JOKE SHE
MEANS IRON FIST OF THE WALL AND
DAN GOOD CLINTON IMPERSONATOR.
>> I SAID TO HILLARY, YOU KNOW,
I'M TRYING TO DO THE BEST I CAN,
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
WOMAN, BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO HER THAT I DIDN'T HOPE WOULD
BE DONE TO HER BY OTHER PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: SET UP OR NOT,
FRED IS FEELING THE OUTRAGE FROM
THE POLKA COMMUNITY.
>> HEY!
>> I THINK THEY FEEL SORRY FOR
ME UNFORTUNATELY.
BUT I'M ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND THANKFULLY THE
CITY OF WARREN WILL BE ALL
RIGHT.
RIGHT, MAY YOUR FAUST, OR SHOULD
I SAY SENATOR KENNEDY.
>> [IMPERSONATING SENATOR
KENNEDY]: I AS THE SENATOR
EXPECT THE BEST.
>> Stephen: THE IMPORTANT
THING IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
PIRATE FRED MERLE HAS LEARNED
HIS LESSON.
>> I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SELL POLKA
PARTY D.V.D.s, EVEN IF THEY'RE
MINE, AND DO ANYTHING ELSE
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR 18
MONTHS.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AGAINST THE
LAW.
FOR 18 MONTHS.
BECAUSE FRED MERLE GOT NAILED.
>> HE GOT NAILED.
HE GOT NAILED.
>> OH, HE GOT NAILED.
OH, MY GOD.
HE GOT NAILED.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH HE GOT
NAILED.
>> HE GOT NAILED.
[POLKA MUSIC PLAYING]

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

SOME COPIES
