ANYWAY, GOLDEN AGE IS OVER.
NATION, I'M IN THE AFRAID OF MY
OWN SHADOW, BUT YOU SHOULD BE
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT
GOES WHEN I TURN OFF THE LIGHTS.
THIS IS THE THREATDOWN.
[SIREN BLARES]
FOLKS, SHOCKING NEWS FROM A LAND
BEYOND AMERICA'S BORDERS.
NORTH DAKOTA.
[LAUGHTER]
JIM.
>> AN 82-YEAR-OLD GRAND FORKS
MAN HAS POINTED OUT A
CONSTITUTIONAL FLAW.
IT PUTS INTO QUESTION WHETHER
LEGALLY NORTH DAKOTA HAS EVER
BEEN A STATE.
TECHNICALLY IT COULD BE ARGUED
IN COURT THAT NORTH DAKOTA IS
STILL A TERRITORY.
>> Stephen: THE STATE OF NORTH
DAKOTA MAY NOT EXIST.
IT'S LIKE SOUTH DAKOTA'S
CANADIAN GIRLFRIEND.
SHE'S UP NORTH SUPPOSEDLY REALLY
COOL AND BEAUTIFUL, BUT NOBODY
HAS EVER SEEN HER.
THIS SHOCKING REVELATION COMES
FROM 82-YEAR-OLD JOHN ROBINSKI,
WHO NOTICED A DISCREPANCY WHILE
READING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE
CONSTITUTION BECAUSE THAT'S THE
MOST EXCITING THING TO DO IN
NORTH DAKOTA.
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S A THRILL SEEKER.
NOW, TURNS OUT THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES ALL STATE
LEGISLATORS, EXECUTIVES AND
JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO SWEAR AN
OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO UPHOLD THE
U.S. CONSTITUTION.
BUT NORTH DAKOTA'S STATE
CONSTITUTION OMITTED THAT
REQUIREMENT FOR ITS GOVERNOR,
WHICH MEANS TECHNICALLY NORTH
DAKOTA ISN'T A STATE, WHICH
BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER
THREE, FAKE STATES.
NATION, AND I'M NOT TALKING TO
YOU, NORTH DAKOTA, THERE ARE NOW
OVER 670,000 FOREIGNERS MASKED
ON OUR NORTHERN SOUTH DAKOTA
BORDER JUST WAITING TO STREAM
INTO REAL AMERICA AND TAKE THE
JOBS WE DON'T WANT TO DO, LIKE
LIVING IN NORTH DAKOTA.
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS DANGER
COMING, FOLKS.
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING
AFTER THIS TERRIFYING
DOCUMENTARY.
THEY'VE GOT STRANGE NATIVE GARB.
THEY REFUSE TO SPEAK ENGLISH.
>> YEP, YOU WET.
>> YEAH, HI, YEAH.
>> YEAH.
>> YEAH.
>> OH, YEAH.
>> OH, YEAH.
>> YEAH.
>> OH, YEAH.
>> YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: YEAH.
AND THEY MAKE A VERY DISTURBING
SAUSAGE.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
I WARNED YOU.
WELL, UNTIL NORTH DAKOTA FIXES
THEIR CONSTITUTION, THEY ARE NOT
A STATE, SO IT IS TIME TO UPDATE
THE FLAG.
JUST GET OUT MY OFFICIAL FLAG
UPDATER.
TAKE IT OUT THERE.
CHECK THE SAMPLER LID.
OKAY.
ALABAMA.
ARKANSAS.
ARIZONA.
CALIFORNIA, NORTH DAKOTA.
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.
JUST ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, PUT
THAT RIGHT THERE.
OKAY.
TO DENOTE THEIR NON-OFFICIAL
STATUS, I HAVE ADDED AN ASTERISK
TO THIS STAR RIGHT THERE.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
THAT MEANS... THAT MEANS IT'S
EITHER ILLEGITIMATE OR HAS TAKEN
STEROIDS.
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, ALASKA.
WHO ME?
I'VE JUST BEEN WORKING OUT A
LOT.
BULL [BLEEPED].
NEXT.
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, WEATHER MEN
HAVE A LIBERAL AGENDA.
WHY ELSE IS THE WEATHER MAP A
GAY PRIDE FLAG?
AND NOW THERE IS A WHOLE NEW
KIND OF SUBVERSIVE WEATHER
BLOWING INTO ARIZONA.
>> TODAY'S WORD OF THE DAY THAT
YOU MUST KNOW IS HABOOB.
>> OFFICIAL TERM IS HABOOB.
>> HABOOB.
>> HABOOB -- H AFTER H-B-O-O-B
IS AN ARABIC NAME FOR AN INTENSE
SAND STORM.
>> Stephen: HABOOB.
THIS IS AMERICA, BRING US THE
FORECAST IN WEATHER.
WHICH BRINGS US TO NUMBER, TWO
SHARIA WEATHER.
FOLKS, I THINK IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT ALL OUR WEATHER FORECASTS
CONTAIN ARABIC NEWMAN ALSO.
WHAT'S NEXT?
ARE WE GOING TO START SAYING,
MAN, IT'S REALLY RAINING CAMELS
AND SPHINXES OUT THERE OR TEACH
OUR KIDS TO BUILD FROSTY THE
SNOW IMAM?
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS
ANGRY INCH A RECENT LETTER TO
THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC, ONE READER
COMPLAINS, "I AM INSULTED THAT
THEY'RE NOW CALLING THIS KIND OF
STORM A HABOOB.
HOW DO YOU THINK OUR SOLDIERS
FEEL COMING BACK TO ARIZONA AND
HEARING SOME MIDDLE EASTERN
TERM."
YES, THINK OF HOW YOU FEEL.
IT'S ALMOST AS DEMORALIZING AS
FINDING OUT THEY'VE THEY'VE COME
BACK TO ARIZONA.
SUCH A LOVELY STATE.
I'M SURE IT'S A LOVELY STATE.
I SAY GET RID OF HABOOB AND
LET'S GET RID OF ALL ARABIC
WORDS FROM ENGLISH.
FROM NOW ON ALCOHOL WILL BE
FREEDOM JUICE.
A GIRAFFE WILL BE FREEDOM NECK.
AND ALPHILADELPHIA WILL BE
RENAMED OSALAD BIN LADEN.
FINALLY THE NUMBER-ONE THREAT TO
AMERICA, MONOPOLY.
THE CLASSIC AMERICAN GAME OF
FAMILY FUN IN VIOLATION OF
ANTITRUST LAWS IS GETTING AN
ALARMING MAKEOVER.
>> NO DICE, NO MONEY, MONOPOLY
IS GOING HIGH TECH.
>> THERE'S A NEW POPLY COMING
ALONG CALLED MONOPOLY LIVE, AND
THE WHOLE THING THERE THAT YOU
SEE IS THAT SPEAKER THING IN THE
MIDDLE IS A COMPUTER.
IT TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO.
>> Stephen: NO COMPUTER TELLS
ME WHAT TO DO.
WHEN MY GARNIN GPS TELLS ME TO
TURN RIGHT, I TURN LEFT.
I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME IN FIVE
YEARS.
WITHOUT CASH, THERE'S IN CASH.
IN THE NEW GAME THERE'S IN CASH,
AND NO CASH, I CAN'T BE BANKER.
HOW WILL I SLIP MYSELF MY $500
BONUS FOR ROLLING DOUBLES?
INSTEAD THERE'S AN INFRARED
TOWER THAT ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS,
KEEPS TRACK OF MONEY AND EVEN
WATCHES OVER ADVANCING THE
PROPER NUMBER OF SPACES.
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A BIG
BROTHER REGULATOR IMPOSING ITS
SOCIALIST NANNY STATE
REGULATIONS ON COMMERCE.
WHAT'S NEXT?
MY SCHNOZZER WILL HAVE TO GET
NUDERS SO IT DOESN'T HUMP THE
TOP HATS?
THIS IS ALL PART OF... FOLKS...
[APPLAUSE]
THIS IS ALL PART OF HASBRO'S
PLAN TO SHORTEN AND SIMPLIFY
MANY OF ITS POPULAR GAMES.
NO DICE, HASBRO, LITERALLY.
THEY TOOK AWAY THE DICE!
MONOPOLY IS SUPPOSED TO BE A
GRUELING, NINE-HOUR MARATHON
THAT DAD ALWAYS WINS BECAUSE HIS
BEDTIME IS LATER.
[LAUGHTER]
SO FOLKS, KEEP THIS
BATTERY-POWERED MENACE OUT OF
YOUR PLAYROOMS UNTIL THEY UPDATE
IT PROPERLY.
ONE PLAYER IS BORN WITH A BILL
WHEREON DOLLARS AND ALL ALL THE
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARDS.
HE BUNDLES ALL THE GOOD
PROPERTIES LIKE MARVIN GARDENS
AND PACIFIC AVENUE WITH CRAP
PROPERTIES LIKE MEDITERRANEAN
AND BALTIC AND COME BIENGS THEM
AS TRIPLE-A RATED PROPERTY SWAP
DERIVATIVES THAT HE SELLS TO THE
OTHER PLAYERS WHO LOSE THEIR
LIFE SAVINGS AND END UP TURNING
TRICKS ON THE BOARDWALK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FINALLY, THE GAME ENDS WHEN THE
LAST PLAYER GOES BROKE AND HAS
NO CHOICE BUT TO JOIN THE ARMY
AND START PLAYING RISK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
