>> AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IS GROWING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO OFF THE LOUISIANA COAST.
>> IT'S RUNNING NEARLY A MILE DEEP, SPREADING ACROSS NEARLY 1,800 SQUARE MILES.
>> IT'S ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS BECAUSE RHODE ISLAND IS THE SMALLEST STATE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THE GOOD NEWSING KEEPS ROLLING IN.
>> FOX NEWS ALERT: THE COAST GUARD HAS INDEED SET A MASSIVE OIL SPILL ON FIRE, TRYING TO
BURN IT OFF BEFORE IT REACHES THE GULF COAST.
>> Stephen: SO GULF COAST RESIDENTS, DON'T WORRY.
YOU NO LONGER HAVE AN OIL SLICK THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND HEADED YOUR WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW IT'S JUST A WALL OF FIRE THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
