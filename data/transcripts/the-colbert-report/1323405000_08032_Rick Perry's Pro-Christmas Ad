>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
NATION, THE RACE FOR THE GOP
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS
FAR FROM OVER.
NEWT GINGRICH MAY BE THE
FRONT-RUNNER NOW BUT BY THE
LOOKS OF HIM HE MIGHT GET
WINDED IF THERE ARE STAIRS
INVOLVED.
THE POINT IS, IT IS STILL
ANYBODY'S GAME HERE BECAUSE
MY MAN RICK PERRY JUST
RELEASED A GREAT NEW AD, JIM?
>> I'M NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT
THAT I'M A CHRISTIAN.
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE IN
THE PEW EVERY SUNDAY TO KNOW
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN
GAYS CAN SERVE OPENLY IN THE
MILITARY, WHEN OUR KIDS
CAN'T OPENLY CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS.
>> Stephen: YES.
GOVERNOR PERRY-- OOH, I
AGREE.
GOVERNOR PERRY IS RIGHT.
THANKS TO THE GAYS, OUR
CHILDREN CAN'T OPENLY
CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF OUR
SAVIOUR IN SCHOOL, AND YET
THESE GAYS IN THE MILITARY
CAN OPENLY CELEBRATE THEIR
FAVORITE HOLIDAY, BEING AWAY
FROM THEIR FAMILY, RISKING
THEIR LIVES IN AFGHANISTAN.
WELL, I FOR ONE-- AM
OFFENDED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I FOR ONE AM
OFFENDED BY THOSE THAT WOULD
CONDEMN THE CHRISTMAS
LIFESTYLE.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
UNLIKE BEING GAY, LOVING
CHRISTMAS IS NOT A CHOICE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I WAS ATTRACTED
TO CHRISTMAS AT A VERY EARLY
AGE.
I DIDN'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IT BUT IT GOT ME VERY
EXCITED.
I REMEMBER LOOKING AT A
PRESENT AND JUST ACHING FOR
IT.
I SAW A GINGERBREAD MAN AND
I WANTED HIM IN MY MOUTH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: FOLKS, IT WASN'T
UNTIL I MOVED TO NEW YORK
AND SAW THE MACY'S PRIDE
PARADE THAT I HAD THE
COURAGE TO THROW ON MY THIGH
HIGH CANDY CANE STOCKS AND
PROUDLY CHANT WE'RE HERE.
WE LIKE REINDEER, GET USED
TO IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I JUST PRAY, I
JUST PRAY FOR A DAY WHEN
CRINGE EL-AMERICANS FEEL
FREE TO DON WE NOW OUR GAY
APPAREL.
WELL NATION, LIKE RICK PERRY,
AROUND HERE WE ARE NOT
ASHAMED OF WHO WE ARE.
WE AT THE REPORT WANT THE
WORLD TO KNOW JUST HOW MUCH
WE TRULY LOVE CHRISTMAS.
BOYS, GET OUT HERE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LOOK AT THAT.
NOT ONE SANTA'S HELPER BUT
TWO.
ALL RIGHT.
FELLAS, ARE YOU READY TO GET
YOUR SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING.
>> MOST DEFINITELY.
>> Stephen: JIMMY, DROP THE
MISTLE TOE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> OH YEAH.
OH YEAH, SO MANY SUGAR
PLUMBS ARE DANCING.
IN YOUR FACE, GAYS.
GOVERNOR PERRY, YOU'RE
WELCOME.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
GO FOR IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
