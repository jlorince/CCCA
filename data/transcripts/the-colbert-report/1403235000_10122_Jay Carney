>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT THE LASTTHREE YEARS FIELDING REPORTERS'
QUESTIONS.
TO MAKE HIM FEEL AT HOME, IWON'T BELIEVE A WORD HE'S
SAYING.
PLEASE WELCOME JAY CARNEY!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HEY, JAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING
ON.
ALL RIGHT.
UH, UH, JAY.
>> STEPHEN.
>> Stephen:  STEPHEN COLBERT,THE "COLBERT REPORT."
I HAVE A 12-PART QUESTION.
JAY, ARE YOU GOING TO ANSWER ANYOF MY QUESTIONS TODAY?
>> I'LL SAY A LOT.
>> Stephen:  YOU'LL SAY A LOT?
ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU STILL WORKING FOR THEWHITE HOUSE OFFICIALLY RIGHT
NOW?
>> I HAVE ANOTHER 24 HOURS ASWHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, SO
-->> Stephen:  OKAY, GOOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SO I CAN STILL MAINTAIN AHEALTHY CONTEMPT FOR YOU.
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU'RE NOTWORKING FOR THAT GUY, YOU KNOW
I'M GOING TO LIKE YOU.
>> WELL I HOPE SO.
>> Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOUGOING TO DO?
FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE YOUQUITTING, YOU QUITTER?
COULD YOU NOT TAKE IT?
>> I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM SOMEBODYCALLING ME A QUITTER.
>> Stephen:  YOU ARE AQUITTER, QUITTER.
MAN UP.
THERE'S A WAR ABOUT TO START INIRAQ AGAIN.
COME ON.
DON'T YOU WANT TO ANSWER THOSEQUESTIONS?
>> YOU KNOW, I GOT AN E-MAILEARLIER THIS YEAR FROM SOMEONE
WHO SAID, "YOU KNOW YOU'RE THELONGEST SERVING WHITE HOUSE
PRESS SECRETARY SINCE THEMID-90s."
AND I CHECKED, AND IT'S TRUE.
I DIDN'T QUITE REALIZE THAT ITWAS SUCH A HIGH-BURNOUT JOB.
BECAUSE I-- I'M A GLUTTON FORPUNISHMENT, AND I ACTUALLY LIKE
IT.
>> Stephen:  REALLY?
>> I LOVE IT, AND I LIKE--THERE'S NOTHING BETTER, I FIND,
THAN REALLY CONTENTIOUS BRIEFINGTO MAKE MY DAY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  WELL, YOU'VE HADA FEW.
>> I'VE HAD A FEW.
>> Stephen:  DO THEY TELL YOUARE YOU HAVING A MEETING BEFORE
YOU GO OUT THERE SAYING,REMEMBER, THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE SUBJECT, LET'S ALL--" ITMIGHT BE, "THIS IS HOW THE
PRESIDENT FEELS OR THIS IS THEADMINISTRATION'S POLICY."
OR DO YOU SOME DAYS GO OUT THEREAND SAY, "I'M GOING TO WING THIS
AND TRY NOT TO START ANINTERNATIONAL INCIDENT?"
>> THERE IS A DANGER THAT ASYOU'VE DONE IT FOR A WHILE, YOU
BEGIN TO THINK YOU DON'T NEED TOACTUALLY --
>> Stephen:  I'M KIND OF THEPRESIDENT.
I'M KIND OF THE PRESIDENT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU FEEL LIKE, HEY, THE CAMERA'SPOINTED AT ME.
I MUST BE THE MAN.
>> MAKE SOME POLICY TODAY.
NO, WHAT YOU REALIZE IS THATWHEN YOU SPEAK FOR THE PRESIDENT
AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEUNITED STATES, YOU HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL.
AND YOU-- YOU COULDINADVERTENTLY CAUSE A CRISIS OR
A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OURNATION AND ANOTHER NATION.
SO WE DID SPEND A-- WE DO SPENDA LOT OF TIME BEFORE BRIEFINGS,
GOING OVER WHAT IS THE NEWDEVELOPMENT OR WHAT NEW ARE WE
SAYING ABOUT A CRISIS OVERSEASOR AT HOME.
>> Stephen:  WHAT'S THEBIGGEST MISTAKE YOU EVER MADE?
WHERE DID YOU REALLY SHANK IT?
BIGGEST REGRET LIKE, "ISHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT."
>> MY BIGGEST REGRET ISOCCASIONALLY I TOOK THE BAIT.
AND WHEN YOU'RE AT THE PODIUM,YOU'RE A LITTLE ABOVE EVERYBODY
ELSE -->> Stephen:  I'VE STOOD UP
THERE.
IT'S A HEADY FEELING.
>> AND YOU CAN, YOU KNOW,DICTATE A LITTLE BIT HOW THE
BRIEFING GOES BY CALLING ON THENEXT PERSON.
SO IT'S EASY TO WIN AN EXCHANGE.
WHEN SOMEBODY'S GETTING RILED UPAND FILLED WITH SOMETIMES
FEIGNED RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION>> Stephen:  COME ON, JAY!
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen:  YOU DIDN'T ANSWERTHE QUESTION!
>> AND IF THEY'RE REALLYOBNOXIOUS AND YOU GET A LITTLE
RATTLED AND YOU SORT OF ENGAGE,YOU FINISH THE EXCHANGE THINKING
I WON THAT.
I KILLED.
AND THEN YOU LOOK AT IT LATER ONTV, AND YOU REALIZE THAT NOBODY
ACTUALLY SEES THE WHOLEEXCHANGE.
THEY JUST SEE YOU WAGGING YOURFINGER OR, YOU KNOW, LOOKING
LIKE A JERK.
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THEPRESIDENT.
SO THOSE ARE THE-- I DIDN'T DOTHAT OFTEN.
BUT WHEN I DID -->> Stephen:  IT WAS TO
JONATHAN CARL OF ABC NEWS.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> IT COULD HAVE BEEN.
WE HAD OUR MOMENTS.
>> Stephen:  YOU TWO HAD YOURTENSE MOMENTS.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST GETA ROOM.
BECAUSE--( LAUGHTER ).
>> YOU KNOW, HE AND OTHERS INTHAT ROOM ARE DOING THEIR JOBS.
>> Stephen:  A JOB YOU DID.
>> I USED TO DO IT.
I DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLYBECAUSE I WAS WORKING --
>> Stephen:  BECAUSE YOU'REBETTER THAN THEY ARE, RIGHT?
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.
>> THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT BUTI WAS A "TIME" MAGAZINE REPORTER
BACK WHEN IT WAS A WEEKLYMAGAZINE.
WHEN I COVERED CLINTON ANDGEORGE W. BUSH, BEFORE THERE WAS
THAT NEED, EVEN AT THEMAGAZINES, TO SORT OF, YOU KNOW,
FILL THE NEWS HOLE EVERY MINUTE,EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY.
>> Stephen:  I BELIEVE REQUESTTHE TIME" MAGAZINE HAS CHANGED
ITS NAME TO "THE NEWS HOLE."
( LAUGHTER ).
>> SO WHAT THAT MEANT WAS IDIDN'T ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF
BACK-AND-FORTH VERY OFTEN WITHTHE PRESS SECRETARY.
BUT THOSE FOLKS ARE DOING THEIRJOB.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT THE FACTTHAT THE BRIEFING IS TELEVISED
IN ITS ENTIRETY, SOMETHING THATMIKE McCURRY BACK IN THE 90s
UNDER CLINTON HAS SAID YES TOAND APOLOGIZED TO EVERY
SUCCESSIVE PRESS SECRETARY,CREATES A THEATERICALITY TO IT
AND SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW,RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.
PEOPLE POSE AND THEY WANT TOHEAR THEMSELVES TALK OR THEY
WANT TO CREATE MOMENTS, CREATINGSOME DRAMA.
>> Stephen:  SHUT THE ( BLEEP )UP.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
DID YOU EVER-- DID YOU EVER--DID YOU EVER--
>> OH, DID I WANT -->> Stephen:  HEY, HEY, GUYS
I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.
WHY DON'T YOU BITE ME.
>> YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY I HAD MYLAST BRIEFING FROM THE PODIUM
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen:  WHEN YOU WERE
GROWING UP, DID YOU WANT TO BE APRESS SECRETARY?
DID YOU HAVE A POSTER OFTRUMAN'S PRESS SECRETARY?
THE VEST.
THE FLAK JACKET.
>> IT'S NOT A VERY IMPRESSIVEFLAK JACKET.
>> Stephen:  ARE YOU ALLOWEDTO TELL WHAT NOTE YOU LEFT OR IS
THAT A SECRET?
YOU LEAVE A NOTE, RIGHT?
>> I'M GOING TO WRITE ONETOMORROW FOR JOSH EARNEST WHO
HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC DEPUTY ANDWILL BE THE NEXT PRESS SECRETARY
>> Stephen:  I'VE ALREADY SAIDTHIS TO YOU, BUT WHAT A NAME FOR
PRESS SECRETARY.
JOSH EARNEST.
HIS NAME LITERALLY MEANS JUSTKIDDING BUT SERIOUSLY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAY.
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JAYCARNEY FOR 24 MORE HOURS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
