>> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS -- THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: FOLKS, YOU KNOW,
I'VE LONGED BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A PIONEER.
I EVEN PIONEERED RECOGNIZING MYSELF AS A PIONEER.
ANYBODY ELSE WHO NOTICED MY GREATNESS IS A LAZY FRAUD WHO I THANK FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
YOU ARE THE REASON I DO THIS.
THIS ISES WHO HONORING ME NOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TONIGHT LONG OVERDUE RECOGNITION OF MY INFLUENCE COMES FROM A JOINT TEACH OF PSYCHOLOGY
RESEARCHERS OUT OF CANADA AND NEW ZEALAND.
MAKES SENSE AFTER ALL WHAT IS NEW ZEALAND BUT THE CANADA OF AUSTRALIA?
THEY EVEN HAVE MOUNTIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IN A STUDY PUB LISHED IN THE PSYCHONOMIC BULLET TEN AND REVIEW -- I READ IT FOR THE
PORNOGRAPHY -- SCIENTISTS LOOK FOR TRUTHINESS WHICH REGULAR VIEWERS KNOW IS THE TRUTH YOU
FEEL IN YOUR GUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE FACTS SUPPORT.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE WORLD CHANGING CONCEPT I TOSSED OFF ON MY FIRST SHOW IN 2005.
EVIDENTLY NEW ZEALAND'S TIME ZONE IS SEVEN YEARS BEHIND.
IN THIS STUDY OF MY IDEA RESEARCHERS SHOWED PEOPLE A SERIES OF CLAIMS SUCH AS THE
LIQUID METAL INSIDE A THERMOMETER IS MAGNESIUM AND ASKED THEM TO AGREE OR DISAGREE
THAT EACH CLAIM WAS TRUE.
EVERYONE KNOWS THE METAL IN THE THERMOMETER IS NOT MAGNESIUM.
ONE TASTE AND YOU KNOW IT'S MADE OF DANCING LIGHT AND LIQUID TIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOWEVER, WHEN A DECK ACTIVE PHOTOGRAPH SUCH AS A PICTURE OF A THERMOMETER APPEARED WITH THE
CLAIM, PEOPLE WERE MORE LIKELY TO AGREE THAT THE CLAIM WAS TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS
ACTUALLY TRUE.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
I DON'T BELIEVE A THING IN BOOKS THAT ONLY HAVE WORDS LIKE THE DICTIONARY BUT I KNOW THAT
CATERPILLAR IS HUNGRY BECAUSE HE ATE RIGHT THROUGH THE PICTURES.
THANK YOU.
MY ONLY PROBLEM --
[ APPLAUSE ]
MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS SCIENTIFIC STUDY IS THAT IT WAS A SCIENTIFIC STUDY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TRUTHINESS AND EMPIRE CL EVIDENCE DON'T MIX.
IT'S LIKE PUTTING METAL IN THE MICROWAVE.
THEY TAKE VENGEANCE BY SPITTING FIRE AND VOIDING MY WARRANTY.
YOU CAN'T PROVE TRUTHINESS WITH INFORMATION.
YOU PROVE TRUTHINESS WITH MORE TRUTHINESS.
IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS TRUTHINESS-INESS.
BUT ULTIMATELY IN THE END I TRUST THIS STUDY FOR ONE IMPORTANT REASON:  IT CAME WITH
A PICTURE OF ME.
AND THAT IS ALL THE EVIDENCE I WILL EVERY NEED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
