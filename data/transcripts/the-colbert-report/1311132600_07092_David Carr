(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY!
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A MEDIA WRITER FEATURED IN THE DOCUMENTARY "PAGE ONE: INSIDE
THE "NEW YORK TIMES." " IT COMBINES THE THRILL OF A NEWSPAPER WITH THE
HEART-STOPPING ACTION OF A DOCUMENTARY.
(LAUGHTER) PLEASE WELCOME DAVID CARR!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DAVID, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT.
YOU WRITE THE MEDIA EQUATION COLUMN FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
YOU'RE ALSO FEATURED IN THE NEW DOCUMENTARY "PAGE ONE: INSIDE
THE "NEW YORK TIMES"" WHICH IS IN THEATERS NOW.
WHY MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE "NEW YORK TIMES?" IS THAT SO LATER IT CAN BE SHOWN
IN MUSEUMS SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT NEWSPAPERS ARE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK THE GESTURE WAS TO CAPTURE A CERTAIN TIME IN NEWSPAPER HISTORY 2009 WHEN HE
COVERED THE MEDIA DESK WE WERE ALL WRITING ABOUT ALL THESE NEWSPAPERS CLOSING.
IT WAS A TIME WHEN WE ALL KIND OF WONDERED, ARE WE GOING TO END UP TYPING OUR OWN NAMES IN THESE
LAYOFF STORIES SOMEWHERE?
AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF TENSION.
>> Stephen: HOW ARE NEWSPAPERS DOING RIGHT NOW?
>> WE'RE DOING BETTER.
WE PAID BACK THAT BIG MEXICAN BILLIONAIRE EARLY AND...
>> Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T PAY MEXICAN BILLIONAIRES BACK THEY COME FOR YOUR KNEES.
>> I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO GET INTO THAT FIGHT SO WE GAVE THEM MONEY INSTEAD.
(LAUGHTER) AND THE... OUR ADS HAVE STABILIZED.
WE PULLED UP TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON THE INTERNET AND IF THEY STOP BY 20 TIMES WE GIVE THEM A LITTLE
NOTICE AND SAY "HOW ABOUT GIVING US SUGAR HERE?"
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT GIVING US SOME SUGAR?
(LAUGHTER) SO THE GRAY LADY HAS TURNED INTO THE PAINTED HARLOT?
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: .
>> THAT'S PART OF THE BRAND REPOSITIONING.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MURDOCH.
PRETTY JUICY STUFF OVER THERE AND I BET YOU PEOPLE IN THE NONNEWSCORP WORLD ARE JUST
LICKING YOUR CHOPS?
(LAUGHTER) YOU JUST LOVE THIS STORY?
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE TO...
SHOULDN'T YOU NON-MURDOCH PAPERS HAVE TO RECUSE YOURSELF?
YOU CAN'T BE OBJECTIVE.
>> DO THE MATH.
YOU'VE GOT A $40 BILLION BIG BLOB THAT OWNS FOX NEWS, FOX
SPORTS, "NEW YORK POST," "WALL STREET JOURNAL." THEY CLOSED 168-YEAR-OLD
NEWSPAPER IS AND THEY'RE RUN BY AN 80-YEAR-OLD I GO GUY WHO ALMOST GOT HIT BY A PIE IN
PARLIAMENT AND HE WAS SAVED BY HIS HOT CHINESE WIFE.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A GREAT STORY.
>> Stephen: THAT IS A GREAT STORY.
>> COME ON!
>> Stephen: ISN'T IT MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING?
HOW BAD OF A DEAL IS IT TO HACK PEOPLE'S PHONES?
THAT'S JOURNALISM!
(LAUGHTER) HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH OF A STORY IS UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING?
ED MYRRH ROW SAID "BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY." (LAUGHTER)
>> I DON'T THINK HE MEANT HACKING INTO A 13-YEAR-OLD MURDER VICTIM'S PHONE AND...
>> Stephen: OKAY YOU'RE PLAYING THE 13-YEAR-OLD MURDER VICTIM, CARD.
WHAT ABOUT THE 4,000 OTHER PEOPLE WHO GOT HACKED INTO WHO WERE NOT THAT PERSON?
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S SO SELECTIVE OF YOU!
>> Stephen: THE CELEBRITIES AND THE ROYALS THAT GOT HACKED I
DON'T THINK PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THAT.
BUT IN THE INSTANCE OF THIS VICTIM-- AND I'LL PLAY THAT CARD AGAIN-- THEY WERE DELETING VOICE
MAILS SO THAT HER FAMILY THOUGHT WELL MAYBE SHE'S ALIVE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, BUT... OKAY,
OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND... I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING.
BUT HE HAS APOLOGIZED.
TODAY IN PARLIAMENT HE SAID "THIS IS THE MOST HUMBLE DAY OF MY LIFE."
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AS YOU SAID HERVETION ALMOST GOT HIT BY A PIE.
LEAVE THE POOR OLD MAN ALONE AND LET THEM GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.
HASN'T HE BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH?
>> WELL, HE APOLOGIZED FOR EVERYTHING AND TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOTHING.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A LEADER!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE WERE ALL FIRED.
THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR HIM.
>> WELL, THERE'S BEEN TEN PEOPLE ARRESTED AS WELL SO... AND IN
TERMS OF, LIKE, WHERE IT ENDS,
WHAT ACTUALLY... WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, I THINK WE'RE AT THE START OF THE STORY NOT THE END
OF THE STORY.
>> Stephen: FOX NEWS IS ALSO A NEWSCORP HOLDING.
IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT THEY'VE DONE ANY OF THIS, YOU KNOW, HACKING INTO VOICE MAIL?
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE... I'M NOT SURE THAT FOX AND FRIENDS COULD
HACK INTO THEIR OWN VOICE MAIL.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, DO YOU...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY'RE JUST NOT TECHNICAL SAVVY  SAVVY.
>> THOSE GUYS HAVE THEIR PINS WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF THEIR HANDS.
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
EXACTLY.
SO DO I.
IS THIS GOING TO HAVE ANY AFFECT ON THE REST OF THE NEWS MEDIA?
THIS SCANDAL?
>> IT'S GOING TO GIVE US LOTS OF JUICY THINGS TO WRITE ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME.
>> Stephen: YOU PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SELL PAPERS BASED UPON THE THINGS THAT THEY DID?
>> BASED ON THE MISERY OF OTHERS.
THAT'S THE TREND.
(LAUGHTER) SMEUP BUT ISN'T THAT MURDOCH'S BUSINESS MODEL ALSO?
>> HE'S JUST BETTER AT IT THAN WE ARE GENERALLY.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: YOU ARE SOMETHING OF A STANDOUT IN THIS DOCUMENTARY.
>> THAT'S SORT OF LIKE BEING THE TALLEST LEPRECHAUN.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A NEWSPAPER!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DAVID CARR "PAGE ONE" IS IN THEATERS NOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
