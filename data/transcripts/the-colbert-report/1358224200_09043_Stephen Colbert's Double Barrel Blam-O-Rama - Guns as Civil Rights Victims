INSURRECTION, YOU WANT YOUR CHAKRAS TO BE OPEN.
AND YOUR BUTT HIGH AND TIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND YOU CAN'T BLAME GUYS LIKE YEAGER FOR BEING PASSIONATE BECAUSE GUNS ARE THE CIVIL
RIGHTS VICTIMS OF OUR TIME.
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT MOST OF THEM ARE BLACK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT I GET NASTY LOOKS WHEN I SIT DOWN WITH ONE AT A LUNCH COUNTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SO.
STANDING WITH ME IS LARRY WARD FOUNDER OF THE FIRST-EVER GUN APPRECIATION DAY, WHICH HAPPENS
TO BE THIS SATURDAY, THE SAME WEEKEND AS MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY.
AND THAT'S NO COINCIDENCE.
>> I BELIEVE THAT GUN APPRECIATION DAY HONORS THE LEGACY OF DR. KING.
I THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD AGREE WITH ME IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY.
>> Stephen: YES, DR. KING WOULD BE PRO-GUN JUST AS SURELY AS JESUS WOULD BE PRO-NAIL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE LIKE MR. WARD, DR. KING UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ROOT OF ALL OPPRESSION IS LACK OF FIREPOWER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> IF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAD BEEN GIVEN THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS FROM DAY ONE OF THE
COUNTRY'S FOUNDING, PERHAPS SLAVERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: YES!
IF ONLY AMERICA'S FOUNDERS HAD TURNED TO THE PEOPLE THEY OWNED AND CHAINED INTO SERVITUDE AND
SAID, "HERE'S YOUR GUN. USE IT RESPONSIBLY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
I GUESS ALL LARRY WARD IS SAYING IS THAT AMERICA WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF GEORGE
WASHINGTON AND THOMAS JEFFERSON HAD BEEN SHOT BY THEIR SLAVES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE HE'S A REASONABLE MAN -- OF COURSE, NOT AS REASONABLE AS THIS DEBATE'S SANEST VOICE THE
MOTOR CITY MADMAN, TED TUGENT!
WHO, IT TURNS OUT, IS CRAZY FOR TOLERANCE.
TELLING WORLDNET DAILY, "THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THE GUN OWNERS OF  AMERICA -- WILL BE
THE ROSA PARKS AND WE WILL SIT DOWN ON THE FRONT SEAT OF THE BUS.
CASE CLOSED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CASE CLOSED.
IF ROSA PARKS HAD HAD A GUN, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THE BACK OF THAT BUS, SHE COULD
HAVE CARJACKED IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, THE NUGE HAS LONG BEEN AN INSPIRATION FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
IN THE WORDS OF THE OLD NEGRO SPIRITUAL, "FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST, WANGO TANGO!
I'M FREE AT LAST."
