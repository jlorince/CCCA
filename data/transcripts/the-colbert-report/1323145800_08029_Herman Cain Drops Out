(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, TODAY IS A SAD DAY
FOR AMERICA'S TOMORROW.
BECAUSE THE DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY, HERMAN CAIN
SUSPENDED HIS CAMPAIGN.
THAT IS A SHAME.
HE TOUCHED SO MANY PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THIS COMES AFTER
SCURRILOUS ALLEGATIONS OF A
13-YEAR LONG AFFAIR WITH AN
ATLANTA BUSINESSWOMAN NAMED
GINGER WHITE.
LAST MONTH WHEN CAIN WAS
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT,
SHE SURGED IN THE POLLS AND
RAKED IN THE CASH BUT HIS
CAMPAIGN SIMPLY COULD NOT
SURVIVE ALLEGATIONS OF A
CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP.
OF COURSE EVER THE STATESMAN,
CAIN LEFT US WITH A REMINDER
OF HIS TRADEMARK EL
CONSEQUENCE.
>> LET ME LEAVE WITH YOU
THIS.
AND I BELIEVE THESE WORDS
CAME FROM THE POKEMON MOVIE.
LIFE CAN BE A CHALLENGE.
LIFE CAN SEEM IMPOSSIBLE.
IT'S NEVER EASY WHEN THERE'S
SO MUCH ON THE LINE.
>> Stephen: YES.
STIRRING WORDS.
IT REMINDED ME OF WHEN
RONALD REAGAN CHALLENGED
AMERICA TO BE GREAT AGAIN BY
SAYING SCOOBY DOOBY DO,
WHERE ARE YOU?
WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO
NOW.
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST
OVERLOOKED TRAGEDY OF CAIN
QUITTING IS HOW IT WILL
AFFECT HIS BOOK, THIS IS
HERMAN KANE.
AS I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER,
CAIN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY ENDS
WITH THIS STIRRING
PREDICTION, WELL, I'M JUST
ABOUT AT THE ELEVATOR UP TO
THE FAMILY QUARTERS, BUT
BEAR WITH ME FOR JUST A
MINUTE MORE AS I CONFIRM WHO
I AM.
IT'S OBVIOUS I'M THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
JUST THINK, A FEW DAYS AGO O
THAT DIDN'T SEEM RIDICULOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHAT A SAD
COUNTRY WE LIVE IN.
SO HERMAN CA COMPANYIN WON'T
HAVE TO RECALL ALL OF HIS
BOOKS.
I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF
WRITING AN EPILOGUE YOU CAN
PASTE INTO YOUR COPY.
IT'S AVAILABLE ON COLBERT
NATION.COM TO PRINT OUT.
SUDDENLY I HEAR THE ALARM
RING.
I SLOWLY OPEN MY EYES AND
REALIZE IT WAS ALL JUST A
DREAM.
THEN I SNUGGLE UP TO THE
WOMAN I LOVE LYING BESIDE ME
AND I THINK WHEN I GET HOME
I'M GOING TO TELL MY WIFE
ALL ABOUT THAT.
THE END.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW MR. CAIN, I KNOW YOU'VE
DROPPED OUT.
PLEASE, PLEASE RECONSIDER.
I REALIZE YOU SAID NO.
BUT HUMAN CERTIFICATE THAT
HASN'T STO
