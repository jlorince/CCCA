FOLKS, SEEING SEAN TAKE TIMEOUT FROM COVERING EBOLA AND
ISIS TO LET US KNOW HIS BODIS ROCK HARD, HAS INSPIRED
ME TO INTRODUCE MY OWNSEGMENT WHERE I ASK MYSELF
FLATTERING QUESTIONS ABOUTMYSELF.
IT'S TIME FOR STEPHENCOLBERT'S EVERYTHING I
WANTED YOU TO WANT TO KNOWABOUT ME BUT I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULDN'T ASK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION,.
(AUDIENCE CHANTS "STEPHEN!")
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, THERE WERE SO MANY
GREAT QUESTIONS TO CHOOSEFROM THAT I SUBMITTED LIKE
HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT OR HOWDO YOU GET YOUR SKIN TO GROW
LIKE A PREGNANT WOMAN'S, ANDWOW, STEPHEN, YOU ARE SO
GREAT IT'S AMAZING.
BUT THE ONE I HAVE DECIDEDTO ASK AN ANSWER TONIGHT IS,
I'VE NOTICED YOU'RE IN MUCHBETTER SHAPE THAN SEAN
HANNITY.
HOW DO YOU WORK OUT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELL, THANKS FOR ASKING ME, ME
SEAN HANNITY DELICATELY SHOOTS
HIS JIUJITSU GUNS AND CANBARELY LIFT A TWO POUND
SCIMITAR.
I WORK OUT LIKE A REAL MAN.EVERY MORNING I GET UP, MAKE A
PROTEIN SHAKE AND THROW IT INTHE FACE OF A JAGUAR, THEN I
CRAB WALK FOR 25 MILES ANDSTAB A MOUNTAIN IN THE
HEART.
THEN I FINISH UP WITH ALITTLE SELF-FLAGELLATION AND
A CATAPULT WORK.
I'M TELLING YOU, CRANKINGTHE RACK REALLY BLASTS MY
CORE.
AND THE PAST 18 MONTHS I'VELOST OVER 30 POUNDS.
NOW MOST OF THAT IS BLOODWEIGHT THANKS TO THE JAGUAR.
OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE-- (APPLAUSE)
OF COURSE THERE IS ONE AREAOF PHYSICAL FITNESS WHERE I
WILL NEVER MATCH SEAN.
FLEXIBILITY.
BECAUSE LISTENING TO HIMANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT
HIMSELF ON HIS OWN SHOW, IKNOW I CAN NEVER WATCH HIS
ABILITY TO GET HIS HEAD UPHIS OWN ASS.
I MEAN LITERALLY, LITERALLY.
I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE OFSEAN'S ANSWERS TO BURNING
QUESTIONS LIKE HOW IS THISNEWS.
