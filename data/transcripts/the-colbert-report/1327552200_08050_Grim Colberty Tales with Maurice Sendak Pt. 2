HERMAN CAIN.
NOW, FOLKS, ANYBODY WATCHING
THIS SHOW KNOWS THAT I HAVE
CONQUERED ALL MEDIA EXCEPT ONE.
CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM!
THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON?
THAT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!
BECAUSE EVEN IF SHE MADE IT, SHE
WOULD BURN UP ON REENTRY.
(LAUGHTER)
DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST.
BUT MY FELLOW CELEBRITIES ARE
CRANKING OUT THE KIDS' BOOKS.
SO TO CASH IN LAST NIGHT I SAT
DOWN WITH LEGENDARY AUTHOR OF
"WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE"
MAURICE SEINE DAK AND NOW THE
DRAMATIC MORE OF IT.
>> WHY WRITE FOR CHILDREN?
>> I DON'T WRITE FOR CHILDREN.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T?
>> NO, I WRITE.
AND SOMEBODY SAYS "THAT'S FOR
CHILDREN."
I DIDN'T SET OUT TO MAKE
CHILDREN HAPPY.
>> Stephen: AND NOW THE STORY
BOOKENDING OF "GRIM COLBERTY
TALES" WITH MAURICE SENDAK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CURRENT
STATE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE?
>> ABYSMAL.
>> Stephen: THERE'S SO MUCH OF
IT, THOUGH.
>> THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ABYSMAL.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOME OF YOUR COMPETITION.
GIVE ME YOUR REVIEWS.
"GREEN EGGS AND HAM."
>> GOOD.
>> Stephen: GREEN EGGS AND
HAM" GOOD.
>> EVERYTHING BY SEUSS IS GOOD.
>> Stephen: REALLY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: GIVE A MOUTH A
COOKIE."
>> MMEH.
>> Stephen: YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE
A MOUSE A COOKIE.
>> YOU SHOULD OPEN THE DOOR
SAYING "GET THE HELL OUT OF MY
HOUSE."
>> Stephen: CURIOUS GEORGE?
>> GREAT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T BELIEVE IN
MONKEYS IN THE HOUSE EITHER.
>> YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
>> Stephen: NO, THEY THROW
THEIR FECES.
THE MONKEY WILL BITE YOUR FACE
OFF.
>> THEY WON'T DO THAT.
>> Stephen: HE COULD HAVE AT
ANY MOMENT.
HAVE I CHANGED YOUR MIND ON
"CURIOUS GEORGE?"
>> Stephen:.
>> .
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE IN FAVOR
OF CHILDREN GETTING THEIR FACES
CHEWED OFF.
"GIRL WITH A DRAGON TATTOO?"
>> ISN'T THAT AN ADULT NOVEL?
>> Stephen: THAT'S PREJUDICED
OF YOU.
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN SO GHETTOIZED
IN THEIR WORK WOULD SAY A CHILD
COULDN'T READ A BOOK ABOUT
MURDER AND SAY DOE MAST
MASOCHISM.
>> YOU TRAPPED ME.
YOU TRAPPED ME.
ZED.
>> Stephen: CHECK MATE, SIR.
>> YOU'RE WRONG BUT YOU TRAPPED
ME.
>> Stephen: AM I?
SO OTHER PEOPLE CAN BE PIGEON
HOLED BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO
MAURICE SENDAK.
THAT'S A CRIME.
>> HOW ABOUT THAT.
I DESERVED THAT.
>> Stephen: DOUBLE STANDARD
MUCH?
LET'S SHIFT GEARS.
EVERY CELEBRITY IS OUT THERE
CASHING IN ON CHILDREN'S BOOKS
AND I WANT IN.
WHAT'S IT TAKE FOR A CELEBRITY
TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL BOOK?
>> WELL, YOU'VE STARTED ALREADY
BY BEING AN IDIOT.
THAT'S REALLY THE VERY FIRST
DEMAND.
>> Stephen: IDIOT?
>> IDIOT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU SPELL
THAT?
>> AFTER THE HAT, YOU KNOW THE
FORMULA.
>> Stephen: YOU JUST NEED AN
ANIMAL AND SOMETHING THEY'VE
LOST.
>> WELL, YES, I MEAN MOST BOOKS
FOR CHILDREN ARE VERY BAD.
>> Stephen: SQUIRREL LOST
THEIR MITTENS.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> Stephen: THE BUFFALO LOST
ITS GUN.
>> YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN TWO
CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
>> Stephen: I'VE GOT A STORY,
CAN I READ IT TO YOU?
>> DO YOU HAVE TO?
>> Stephen: I'S CALLED "I AM
APPALLED AND SO CAN YOU."
I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU.
I AM A POLE, THAT MUCH IS CLEAR
TO ME.
BUT JUST WHAT TYPE OF POLE COULD
I POSSIBLY BE?
I TRIED TO BE A POLE FOR
VAULTING BUT I COULDN'T SEEM TO
BEND.
I WOULD LOVE TO BE A SKI POLE
BUT FOR THAT I'D NEED A FRIEND.
I WISHED I WAS THE NORTH POLE
AND MARK THE HOME OF SANTA OR
EVEN JUST A GALLUP POLL CALLING
VOTERS IN ATLANTA.
(LAUGHTER)
I CONSIDERED FIREMEN AND
FISHING, WAS IT TOTEM FOR SOME
TIME?
AND EVEN TRIED TO BE A STRIPPER
POLE BUT I COULDN'T STAND THE
GRIND.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THEN ONE DAY IN MY DEPTH OF
DESPAIR SOME SCOUTS BROUGHT ME
OLD GLORY AS SOMETHING TO WEAR.
AND WHILE SHE DANCED AND SHE
WAVED, IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME I'M
THE BEST KIND OF POLE YOU CAN
POSSIBLY BE.
I'M AN AMERICAN FLAGPOLE NOW
PLEDGE A LIEGE YANS OR ELSE.
>> (LAUGHS).
>> Stephen:
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I LIKE IT.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET THAT AS
A BLURB.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: "THE SAD THING IS
I LIKE IT."
>> IT'S A GOOD BLURB.
AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GET A
POPULAR ILLUSTRATOR WHO HAS A
HORRIBLE SENSE OF DESIGN, NO
TASTE FOR TYPE, NOTHING ABOUT
THE AESTHETICS OF WHAT A PICTURE
BOOK WOULD LOOK LIKE AND YOU
WILL PROBABLY MAKE A LOT OF
MONEY.
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU TEACH ME
HOW TO DRAW?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU DO ALL YOUR WORK?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DRAW A POLE.
I'M NOT VERY GOOD A DRAWING.
LET ME TRY A POLE HERE.
>> BE CAREFUL.
I ASSUME YOU WERE HUFFING THESE
WHEN YOU DRAW "WHERE THE WILD
THINGS ARE."
>>
♪ I REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR..." ♪
(LAUGHTER)
THAT JUST PULLED THE SONG RIGHT
OUT OF ME.
>> Stephen: RIGHT OUT OF YOU.
>> RIGHT OUT OF MY NOSE.
>> Stephen: WE GOT A MOUNTAIN.
A CLOUD.
A POLISH WOMAN HOLDING A POLE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: IT COULD BE A
POLISH STRIPPER.
>> THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
>> Stephen: ANY ADVICE HERE?
>> NO, I JUST... I WOULD LEAVE
IT ALONE BECAUSE IT HAS A KIND
OF DELICACY AND IRRATIONALITY
AND... TERRIBLE QUALITY OF
ORDINARINESS.
>> Stephen: TERRIBLY ORDINARY.
MAURICE SENDAK, THAT'S ANOTHER
GREAT BLURB.
>> SUPREMELY ORDINARY.
>> Stephen: WELL, MOSHE, I
THINK WITH MY FANTASTIC BOOK
IDEA, MY WORDS, MY DRAWINGS AND
YOUR BLURB I THINK WE'VE GOT A
HIT HERE.
>> I KNOW WE DO.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR.
(APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, ONCE I GET A PUBLISHER I
"I AM A POLE AND SO CAN YOU
"REASON AVAILABLE IN BOOKSTORES
EVERYWHERE IN HARD COVER, PAPER
BACK, MAYBE EVEN AN E-BOOK.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT,
MAURICE?
>> (BLEEP)ING WILL I SAY?
I HATE THOSE E-BOOKS, THEY CAN
NOT BE THE FUTURE.
THEY MAY WELL BE... I WILL BE
