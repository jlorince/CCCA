STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR JOINING US,
EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, NATION T IS FEBRUARY
2nd, GROUNDHOG DAY.
TODAY CROWDS GATHERED AT
GOBBLER'S NOBODY IN
PENNSYLVANIA TO FIND OUT IF
PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL WILL JUNK
INTO THE REPUBLICAN RACE.
STILL TIME.
THEY ALSO WANTED TO KNOW HOW
MUCH LONGER WINTER WOULD
LAST.
AND ONCE AGAIN, PHIL SAW HIS
SHADOW PREDICTING SIX MORE
WEEKS.
DAMN IT.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
I CANNOT TAKE SIX MORE WEEKS
OF 55 DEGREES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I AM SICK AND
TIRED OF WEARING THESE HEAVY
WINTER SAN DAHLS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I CANNOT BELIEVE
PEOPLE EVEN LISTEN THIS GUY.
I MEAN MI A GROUNDHOG DAY
ORIGINALIST.
AND FRANKLY I BELIEVE WE
HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THE TRUE
MEANING OF THE DAY.
FOR STARTERS, FOLKS, IT'S
ORIGINAL NAME WAS CANDLEMAS,
IT'S AN SHENT CRISTO PAGAN
RIGHT CELEBRATING THE CHRIST
CHILD AT THE TEMPLE.
MEDIEVAL VILLAGERS WOULD
OBSERVE HEDGEHOGS, BADGERS
OR BEARS TO PREDICT THE
WEATHER.
I MEAN THOSE ARE ANIMALS
THAT UNDERSTAND METEROLOGY.
NOT SOME STUPID GROUNDHOG
THAT IS CLEARLY NEVER BEEN
WITHIN TEN FEET OF A DOPPLER
RADAR.
BUT NOW, FOLKS, CANDLEMAS
HAS ALL BEEN GROUNDHOGGED UP
AND COMMERCIALIZED.
THESE DAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT
SELLING TOP HATS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WHAT HAS
HAPPENED TO THE SIMPLE
CANDLEMAS TRADITION OF
HARVESTING BEES WAX FROM THE
FAMILY LIFE TO MAKE CANDLES
FOR A PRIEST TO BLESS IN
ORDER TO WARD OFF STORMS, OR
IS IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO
KEEP LIVE BEES IN THE HOUSE
WHEN BOTH PARENTS ARE
WORKING?
AND HARDLY ANYONE STILL
SINGS THE TRADITIONAL SCOTCH
CANDLEMAS SONG EARLY ON
BRIDES MOURN THE CERTIFICATE
PENT WILL COME FROM THE
HOLLOW, I WILL NOT MOLEST
THE CERTIFICATE PENT NOR
WILL THE CERTIFICATE PENT
MOLEST ME-- SERPENT MOLEST
ME.
YOU NEVER HEAR THAT THESE
DAYS.
AND THEY WONDER
