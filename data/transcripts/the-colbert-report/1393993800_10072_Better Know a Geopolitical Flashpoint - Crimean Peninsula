THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, I GOTSOME NEWS FOR YOU.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS AFAILED LEADER.
DON'T WORRY-- THIS ISN'T A RERUNOR A FUTURE EPISODE.
IT'S TONIGHT.
LAST WEEK OBAMA ANNOUNCED THEPLANNED WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN
FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN BY 2015.
WITH A STROKE OF HIS PEN, THEREGOES AMERICA'S STRATEGIC RESERVE
OF RUBBLE.
NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE WASTED 12YEARS MEMORIZING ALL THOSE
TRICKY MUSLIM NAMES--KARZAI.
HAQQANI.
BEYONCE.
I MEAN, I WAS ALMOST READY FORTHAT JELLY.
THERE IS A NEW FOREIGN POLICYCRISIS FOR OBAMA TO SHRANK.
>> UKRAINE UNRAVELING.
>> UKRAINE OFFICIALS SAY THEY'REON THE BRINK OF WAR WITH RUSSIA.
THOUSAND OF RUSSIAN TROOPS HAVEOUSTED UKRAINIAN FORCES AND
TAKEN COMPLETE CONTROL OF KEYSTRATEGIC CRIMEAN PENINSULA.
CRIMEAN CRISIS HAS DEEPENEDOVERNIGHT.
>> Stephen:  YES, A CRISIS INCRIMEA.
NOW, LIKE AMERICANS, UNTILRECENTLY, I THOUGHT CRIMEA WAS A
DELIGHTFUL TYLER PERRYCHARACTER.
TURNS OUT IT'S THE MOSTIMPORTANT PLACE YOU DON'T KNOW
JACK ABOUT.
WELL, STRAP IN, BECAUSESTEPHEN COLBERT'S ABOUT TO
GET YOU JACKED.
IN PART ONE OF MY INFINITE-PARTSERIES "BETTER KNOW A
"GEOPOLITICALFLASHPOINT." TONIGHT, THE
CRIMEAN PENINSULA, THE FIGHTIN'ALMOST AN ISLAND.
PROTRUDING SOUTHWARD INTO THEBLACK SEA CARTOGRAPHERS REFER TO
COUNTRY MAY AS "THE UKRAINE'SBALL SACK."
OVER THE MILLENNIA, COUNTRYMAY'S BEEN OCCUPIED BY GREEKS,
ROMANS, MONGOLS, OTTOMANS,BYZANTINES, AND EVEN THE GOTHS,
WHO INVADED JUST TO PISS OFFTHEIR PARENTS.
IN 1441, THE PENINSULA BECAME ANINDEPENDENT MUSLIM STATE CALLED
THE CRIMEAN KHANATE, RUN BY ATURKIC PEOPLE CALLED TATARS, AND
THEIR CHILDREN THE TARTAR TOTS.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
IN 1774, RUSSIA CONQUEREDCRIMEA
IN 1853, THE HORRIBLE CASUALTIESOF THE FIRST CRIMEAN WAR
INSPIRED ALFRED LORD TENNYSON'SCLASSIC POEM, "THE CHARGE OF THE
LIGHT BRIGADE," WITH THE FAMOUSLINES, "THEIRS NOT TO MAKE
REPLY, THEIRS NOT TO REASON WHY,THEIRS BUT TO DO AND DIE, HAPPY
VALENTINE'S DAY TO A SPECIALNEPHEW."
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NOW, RUSSIA-- BIG TENNYSON FANSHERE TONIGHT.
RUSSIA KEPT POSSESSION OF CRIMEAUNTIL 1954, WHEN
NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV REGIFTEDCOUNTRY MAY TO UKRAINE, AFTER A
HIGH-LEVEL SUMMIT BETWEEN HISLIVER AND A BOTTLE OF STOLI.
AT THE TIME OF THE USSR'SCOLLAPSE THE UKRAINE HAD THE
THIRD LARGESTNUCLEAR STOCKPILE IN THE WORLD,
BUT SURRENDERED IT IN ADIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT CALLED THE
"BUDAPEST MEMORANDUM," LATERADAPTED INTO A WHIMSICAL FILM BY
WES ANDERSON.
( LAUGHTER )IN THE AGREEMENT, UKRAINE GAVE
UP ITS NUKES, AND IN EXCHANGE,RUSSIA PROMISED NEVER TO USE
"THREATS OR USE OF FORCE AGAINSTTHE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OR
POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OFUKRAINE."
TRAGICALLY IT APPEARS UKRAINIANDIPLOMATS FORGOT TO CALL "NOBACKSIES"
