COINING THE TERM VIRTUALREALITY.
PLEASE WELCOME JARON LANIER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )JARON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen:  SIR, YOU'RE ACOMPUTER SCIENTIST, YOU'RE A
COMPOSER, A VIRTUALARTIST AND AUTHOR.
BEST KNOWN AS THE FATHER OFVIRTUAL REALITY.
YOU WORKED AT ATARI, WHERE YOUWERE THE LEAD SCIENTIST OF THE
NATIONAL TELEEMERGENCEINITIATIVE, ENCYCLOPEDIA
BRITANNIA INCLUDES YOU IN THEIRLIST OF THE 300 GREATEST
INVENTORS, AND YOUR BOOK ISCALLED "WHO OWNS THE FUTURE?"
>> ALL OF THAT IS TRUE.
>> Stephen:  OKAY.
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  IS IT TRUE--OKAY--
>> IS IT GOING TO GO DOWNHILLFROM HERE?
>> Stephen:  YEAH.
WHO DOES-- WHO DOES OWN THEFUTURE?
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, THOSE WHOOWN THE FUTURE ARE THE ONES WITH
THE VERY BIGGEST, MOST EFFECTIVECOMPUTERS THAT CAN GATHER
DATA, ANALYZE ITBETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, AND
USE IT TO CALCULATE LITTLE, TINYADVANTAGES, LIKE SLIGHTLY MORE
MANIPULATIVE LOANS OR SLIGHTLYMORE TRICKY HEALTH INSURANCE
POLICIES.
AND OVER TIME, THESE TINYADVANTAGES ACCUMULATE, AND THEN
YOU GET THIS INCREDIBLE WEALTHPOWER CONCENTRATION, WHICH IS
THE CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR TIME.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU THINKTHAT'S A BAD THING?
>> YOU KNOW, I-- I BENEFITTED.
I'VE DONE GREAT -->> Stephen:  AND YOU HELPED
CREATE THIS PROBLEM.
>> TOTALLY, I DID.
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE FRANKENSTEIN.
YOU CAME TO WARN US ABOUT YOURMONSTER.
>> THAT'S NOT A BAD METAPHOR.
I'LL TAKE IT.
>> Stephen:  OF COURSE IT'S NOT,I DID IT.
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
THE MONSTER MIGHT TURN ON YOUAND TEAR YOU LIMB FROM LIMB.
>> I HAVE A DAUGHTER NOW ANDLOOK AT THE WORLD AND I THINK DO
I WANT HER TO BE IN THISPRIVILEGED RICH FAMILY WITH THE
WORLD FALLING APART ANDEVERYBODY LIVING IN INSECURITY
OR IN A SLIGHTLY LESS PRIVILEGEDFAMILY --
>> Stephen:  WHAT'S UNHEALTHYABOUT THIS WORLD?
WHAT'S THE SIGN OF THE DISEASETHERE JARON?
>> REAL WEALTH IS WHEN YOUR--YOUR WEALTH IS DEPENDENT ON
EVERYBODY ELSE'S WEALTH.
REAL WEALTH IS COMMUNITYWEALTH.
IF IT'S JUST A CONCENTRATION,THAT'S FAKE WEALTH.
IT FALLS APART.
>> Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOUTALKING ABOUT?
I'M AT THE TOP OF THIS PYRAMIDRIGHT NOW.
I'M AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID,ANOTHER RIGHT NOW?
>> IN MY CIRCLES YOU'RE NOT.
I'M SORRY, IT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen:  YOU DON'T KNOW,YOU DON'T KNOW.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
YOU DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I HAVE A SECRET CRIMINALENTERPRISE.
>> I'M WEARING THESE SPECIALGLASSES THAT TELL ME MORE THAN
YOU THINK.
>> Stephen:  WOW.
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.
I GOT ONE, TOO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )SO-- BUT, OKAY, THE-- YOU KNOW,
THE MONSTER IS ON THE LOOSE.
YOU CAN'T PUT THE JEANIE BACK INTHE BOTTLE.
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CANWE MADE UP THIS WHOLE INTERNET
THING, AND THIS PARTICULAR IDEAABOUT HOW TO DO OPEN CULTURE ON
IT AND OPEN ECONOMIES VERYRECENTLY.
SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRYTO DO THIS BETTER.
I'M NOT SAYING I KNOW THEPERFECT ANSWER FOR IT, BUT I
THINK WE HAVE TO GIVE A SHOT.
WE HAVE TO TRY TO IMPROVE THISBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT
CREATING A SUSTAINABLE DIGITALECONOMY.
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.
>> Stephen:  YOU SAY OURMIDDLE CLASS IS DISAPPEARING,
OKAY, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Stephen:  THE MIDDLE CLASSIS DISAPPEARING AND THE INTERNET
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT ORYOUR WHOLE DREAM OF A DIGITAL
FUTURE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITHTHE--
>> YEAH, I THINK IT REALLY DOES.
>> Stephen:  CAN'T WE JUSTBUILD A VIRTUAL REALITY WHERE
THE MIDDLE CLASS STILL EXISTS?
PUT ON THOSE OCULAR HELMETS ANDGO, LOOK, LOOK, A TWO-CAR
GARAGE?
>> I GUESS IF EVERYBODY WILL BUYIT, I GUESS THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD.
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD DEMANDMORE. WE'VE TALKED OURSELVES
INTO THIS DOUBLE ECONOMY.
WHERE IF IT'S STUFF, WE BELIEVEIN MARKETS.
IF IT'S ABOUT INFORMATION, IFIT'S ABOUT CREATIVITY--
COMEDIANS, JOURNALISTS, THINGSLIKE THAT-- THEN WE THINK IT
SHOULD BE SHARED AND SHOULD BEOPEN.
WHEN YOU BREAK THE ECONOMY INHALF LIKE THAT, EVEN THOUGH
SHARING IS LOVELY, YOUGRADUALLY PUT ALL THE
INFORMATION, WORKERS, INTO THISINFORMAL ECONOMY, A SLUM ECONOMY
OF REPUTATION, BARTER-- WHICH ISBEAUTIFUL IN ITS OWN WAY --
>> Stephen:  YOU'RE SAYINGWE'RE ALL-- WE'RE ALL-- WE'RE
ALL SORT OF THE PRODUCT NOWBECAUSE AS WE PUT OUR
INFORMATION INTO THE INTERNETAND WE BECOME OUR-- OUR
INFORMATION BECOMES A COMMODITY,WE SHOULD GET PAID A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR ALL THATINFORMATION AND THAT VALUE WE'RE
PROVIDING THESE INTERNETPROVIDERS?
>> HOW ABOUT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE?
>> Stephen:  SURE.
>> LANGUAGE TRANSLATORS.
SOMEBODY TAKES THIS AND SAYS I'MGOING TO MAKE THE SPANISH
VERSION OF IT.
THOSE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING NOW.
THEY'RE MAKING LESS MONEY THANTHEY USED TO.
BUT THE ALGORITHMS THATTRANSLATE AUTOMATICALLY THAT
TAKE AWAY A LOT OF THEIR WORK,THOSE ALGORITHMS DEPEND ON THE
SAME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RECONSTANTLY CREATING THE PHRASE
EXAMPLES THAT MASH UP TO CREATETHE AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION.
THE THING IS THE PEOPLE ARESTILL NEEDED --
>> Stephen:  EVENTUALLY WE'LLGET THE TRANSLATION PERFECT.
>> NO, WE WON'T.
BECAUSE LANGUAGE ISN'T FIXED.
IT KEEPS ON MOVING.
>> Stephen:  IT WON'T KEEPMOVING IF ONLY ROBOTS ARE
SPEAKING IT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> AND-- AND-- ( CHEERS ).
>>>> -- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.
YOU SOLVED IT.
YOU SOLVED IT.
>> Stephen:  I RECOMMEND YOUDON'T.
JARON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING ME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  I DIDN'T GETALL OF THAT.
BUT JARON LANIER, HIS BOOK IS"WHO OWNS THE FUTURE?."
AND I THINK HE SAID THAT YOU DO.
