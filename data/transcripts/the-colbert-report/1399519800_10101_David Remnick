>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,MY GUEST TONIGHT SAY
RENOWNED JOURNALIST WHO HASA NEW COLLECTION OF NEW
YORKER PIECES FROM THE1940s.
PREVIOUSLY ONLY AVAILABLE INTHE WAITING ROOM OF A
90-YEAR-OLD DENTIST.
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID REMNICK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
I HAVE TO GET RID OF THESENEW YORKERS, THEY STACK UP
AFTER A WHILE.
THANKS FOR COMING ON, WEHAVE MET BEFORE, I HAVE
NEVER HAD YOU DOWN FOR ANINTERVIEW.
NICE TO FINALLY HAVE YOUHERE.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: EDITOR OF "THENEW YORKER" SINCE 1998 ALSO
A PULITZER PRIZE WINNINGAUTHOR OF LENINS TOMB, HAVE
WRITTEN OVER A HUNDRED ARTICLESFOR YOUR OWN MAGAZINE, YOU
MUST KNOW SOMEBODY.
AND YOU'RE THE AUTHOR-- NOTTHE AUTHOR, YOU'RE HERE WITH
A NEW BOOK CALLED THE 40s.
THE STORY OF A DECADE.
AND THESE ARE SOME OF THEBEST ARTICLES FROM THE 1940S.
>> IT WAS A TIME WHEN "THENEW YORKER" GREW UP WITH THE
COUNTRY, THE MAGAZINE WAS AKIND OF COMIC LIGHT MAGAZINE
OF THE JAZZ AGE AND SUDDENLYWITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE WAR,
THE MAGAZINE REALLY GREW UP.
IT WAS KIND THE BIRTH OF ALITERARY JOURNALISM BOTH AT
WAR AND AT HOME AFTERWARDSAS THE NATION BECAME THIS
KIND OF SINGULAR POWERDURING THE START OF THE
AMERICAN CENTURY.
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS THEMOST OBVIOUS CHANGE TO THE
MAGAZINE?
WERE ALL THE DOGPSYCHIATRISTS OVERSEAS
FIGHTING HITLER.
>> YEAH, THEY WERE ON EYEDESERT ISLAND, IN THE SAME
CARTOON.
I THINK IT WAS AN AMAZINGTHING, THE IDEA THAT YOU
WOULD SEND A JOURNALIST TOJAPAN, A JOURNALIST AND
MAYBE EVERYBODY HERE HASREAD THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: IN 1946.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THAT WAS CONSIDERED INSOME WAYS AN INCREDIBLY BOLD
THING TO DO.
BUT EVEN SUBVERSIVE TOREPORT ON THE FALLEN ENEMY
IN BASICALLY SYMPATHETICTERMS AND SEE WHAT THE
EFFECT OF AN ATOMIC BOMB HADBEEN ON THIS ISLAND.
>> Stephen: SO "THE NEWYORKER" SENT SOMEBODY TO
HIROSHIMA IN '46 TO REPORTFROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF
THE PEOPLE THAT GOT BOMBED.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THAT WASN'T SEENAS TREASONIST.
>> THIS ARTICLE WHICH TOOKUP THE ENTIRE ISSUE OF "THE
NEW YORKER", NO CARTOONS,JUST FROM BEGINNING TO END WAS
SUCH A SENSATION THAT IT WASREAD OVER THE RADIO, ARMED
THE WORLD AND TRANSLATEDINTO MANY, MANY LANGUAGES
AND IT BECAME, YOU KNOW, ASTAPLE OF HIGH-SCHOOL
STUDENTS EVERYWHERE.
>> Stephen: I NEVER READ THEARTICLE.
GIVE ME A PREVIEW, DID THEJAPANESE LIKE IT?
>> THEY DID NOT SO MUCH.
>> Stephen: THE UNITEDSTATES DID IT SO IT HAD TO
BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> THAT HAS A CERTAIN LOGIC.
>> Stephen: WHY WAS THEREANYONE LEFT TO WORK ON "THE
NEW YORKER"?
WHY WASN'T EVERY SINGLEPERSON IN THE 1940s OFF
FIGHTING.
>> GOOD POINT.
FOR THE FIRST TIME "THE NEWYORKER" REALLY HAD MANY MORE
WOMEN ON ITS STAFF BECAUSETHERE WERE SO MANY STAFF
WRITERS AND EDITORS WHO HADGONE OFF IN UNIFORM TO
EUROPE AND TO ASIA.
>> AS "THE NEW YORKER"CHANGED FROM A COMEDY
MAGAZINE IN THE 1920s AND1930s INTO WHAT IT BECAME
WHICH WAS SORT OF A-- REALLYJOURNALISM IN THE 1940s,
WERE THERE PEOPLE THAT Y'ALLREJECTED THAT LATER YOU SAID
BOY, WE WERE DUMB.
>> YEAH, I MEAN NO MAGAZINECAN GET EVERYBODY.
SO A POET LIKE ELIZABETHBISHOP FLOURISHED IN "THE
NEW YORKER".
AND WE MISSED THE BOAT ONSOMEBODY LIKE WALLACE STEVENS
AND IT IS INEVITABLE THAT AMAGAZINE IS GOING TO DO
THIS.
AND IT'S GOING TO SET THETONE OF THE MAGAZINE, NOT
ONLY WHO YOU ARE RIGHTABOUT, AND SOMETIMES WHO YOU
ARE WRONG ABOUT.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU, AS ISAID YOU WON A PULITZER
PRIZE FOR YOUR BOOK LENIN'STOMB.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THERUSSIANS AND THE RUSSIAN
MIND.
>> YEAH.
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
I-- I'M WORRIED ABOUT THEUKRAINE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHY AM I WORRIED?
>> AND HOW MUCH LONGER AM IGOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
IT, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'MJUST WAITING THROUGH AN
OMELET OF CONSONANTS WITHEVERY WORD IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
TO MEMORIZE THE ABU, BINLADEN OR WHATEVER.
AT LEAST THAT IS LANGUAGEHAS SOME [BLEEP] VOWELS IN
IT.
>> Stephen: IT'S A CONSONANTHEAVY DIET OVER THERE.
LET'S BIND THEM UP A BIT,THEY SHOULD GET A CELL
PHONE.
THAT IS THE CENTER OF THECONTROVERSY, IT A DISASTER.
THERE MIGHT BE A CIVIL WARIN UKRAINE IF WE DON'T WATCH
OUT.
THERE MIGHT BE A-- .
>> Stephen: IS IT REALLY ACIVIL WAR OR A WAR BETWEEN
RUSSIA AND UKRAINE.
>> A CIVIL WAR IN MY VIEWTHAT IS BEING PROVOKED BY
RUSSIA.
THERE IS BLAME TO GO ALLAROUND.
EVERYBODY HAS MISHANDLEDTHIS BUT AT THE CENTER OF
THIS, THE REAL CULPRIT OFWHY WE ARE IN THIS TERRIBLY
DANGEROUS SPOT IS VLADIMIRPUTIN.
VLADIMIR PUTIN.
>> Stephen: HE IS A STRONGLEADER.
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THAT.
>> YES, HE SHOWS HISMUSCLE.
>> Stephen: YES, HE DOES.
>> HE DOES SHOW HIS MUSCLE.
>> Stephen: HE TAKES HISSHIRT OFF.
HE HAS BEEN TAKING HIS SHIRTOFF FOR A LONG TIME.
WHEN WILL WE KNOW THINGS AREGETTING REALLY DANGEROUS,
WHEN HE TAKES HIS PANTS OFF?
>> YOU KNOW, FOR MANYREASONS I'M PRAYING HE KEEPS
HIS PANTS ON.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTERFOR THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: DO THE RUSSIANPEOPLE LIKE THIS?
>> UNFORTUNATELY, YES, HISAPPROVAL RATING IS IN THE
80s.
>> Stephen: DO YOU THINK HEDID THIS FOR APPROVAL
RATINGS?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE HE COULDHAVE JUST GONE ON "BETWEEN
TWO FERNS" AND TAKEN CARE OFIT THAT WAY.
>> YES, YEAH.
THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED.
>> Stephen: DAVID, THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DAVID REMNICK, "THE NEW
YORKER".
THE 40s.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
