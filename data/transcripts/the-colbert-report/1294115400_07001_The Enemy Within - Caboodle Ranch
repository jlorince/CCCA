THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NATION, AS A NEWS MAN, IT IS MY
JOB TO SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT
LOOKING OUT FOR THINGS TRYING TO
KILL US.
WELL, TONIGHT MY SCARE-DAR IS
ZEROING IN ON A NEW THREAT OUT
OF THE TOWN OF LEE, FLORIDA.
LEE, FLORIDA, IT'S A SMALL TOWN,
BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT
INSECURE ABOUT IT.
LOCALS WILL TELL YOU IT'S A GOOD
LITTLE TOWN.
>> IT'S A GOOD LITTLE TOWN.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: BUT HIDDEN AMONG
LEE'S 350 HARD-WORKING
RESIDENTS, WE FOUND THE ENEMY
WITHIN.
>> WHAT IS LEE LIKE?
I'LL TELL YOU.
I LOVE IT.
I'VE BEEN HERE ALL MY LIFE.
>> Stephen: BUT THAT LIFE MAY
NOT LAST MUCH LONGER BECAUSE
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN IN THIS
HEAVILY GUARDED COMPOUND, A
SHADOWY FIGURE IS BUILDING AN
ARMY OF NATURAL-BORN KILLERS.
CATS, HUNDREDS OF CATS.
MEET THE ENEMY WITHIN.
>> I AM THE FOUNDER OF CABOODLE
RANCH, AND I WANT TO WELCOME
EVERYBODY TODAY TO CABOODLE
RANCH.
>> CABOODLE RANCH, HOME TO CRAIG
GRANT AND 650 CATS.
>> COME ON.
>> IT'S A PERMANENT HOME FOR
CATS THAT HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO
GO, WHICH YOU CAN SEE, THEY DO
ENJOY IT.
>> CLEARLY THIS BEGS THE
QUESTION, WHAT IS THIS MAN
PLANNING.
>> WHAT IS MY PLAN FOR WHAT?
>> Stephen: GOOD QUESTION,
CRAIG, FOR WHAT?
THE UNTRAINED EYE MAY SEE A
FELINE WONDERLAND, BUT WHY HAS
CRAIG BUILT AN EXACT
REPRODUCTION OF AN AMERICAN
TOWN?
AND WHY IS HE TRAINING HIS CATS
TO TAKE OVER OUR MOST VITAL
INSTITUTIONS?
GOVERNMENT.
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
EVEN OUR FAILING SCHOOLS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND WHY IS HE RECRUITING AN
INTERNATIONAL ARMY OF THESE
KILLERS?
>> I JUST HAD A CAT FLY IN FROM
GERMANY.
I'VE GOT TWO IN FROM OKINAWA.
>> Stephen: KAMIKAZE KITTIES.
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WHAT IS THERE TO BE AFRAID OF?
>> Stephen: EVERYTHING.
LET'S LOOK BACK AT THE CAT'S
REIGN OF TERROR.
FORT TOWNSEND, WASHINGTON, ONE
CAT TRIES TO MURDER HIS FAMILY,
SETTING THEIR HOME ON FIRE WITH
A TOASTER.
>> I REMEMBER CYRUS ACTING
STRANGE THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE.
>> Stephen: IN OHIO, THIS FOX
8 NEWS REPORTER ALMOST LOSES HER
MONEY MAKER.
IN IDAHO, A WOMAN SAYS SHE WAS
MAULED FOR THE KILL BY HER PET
CAT.
AND LET US NOT FORGET PINKIE.
>> THIS IS PINKIE.
>> Stephen: CALIFORNIA'S CAT
OF THE WEEK, WHO MADE CATNIP OF
THIS OFFICER'S JUNK.
BUT DON'T JUST TAKE THE
INTERNET'S WORD FOR IT.
>> YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD BE
AFRAID OF CATS.
>> Stephen: MEET DR. KAREN
OBERTHALLER.
>> I'M A VETERINARIAN WITH NYC
VET TEAR SPECIALISTS.
>> Stephen: SHE'S ALSO AN
ANIMAL DOCTOR, AND SHE SAYS
THERE IS PLENTY TO FEAR.
>> NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE A BUNCH
OF SHARP TEETH AND THEIR CLAWS,
BUT THEY CAN CARRY CAT SCRATCH
FEVER, RABIES, RINGWORM, AND CAT
FECES ARE A THREAT TO HUMAN
HEALTH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY'RE HARBORING WEAPONS OF ASS
DESTRUCTION.
>> I THINK 650 CATS LIVING
TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE IS MY
BIGGEST NIGHTMARE.
>> Stephen: LOCALS ARE
UNDERSTANDABLY ALARMED.
>> I DON'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Stephen: AND WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
>> NOTHING.
>> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE A
FATAL MISTAKE BECAUSE CRAIG IS
DOING SOMETHING.
>> WELL, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
EXPANDING AND WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A THOUSAND CATS PROBABLY
WITHIN NEXT SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS.
>> Stephen: 1,000 CATS.
THAT'S THREE CATS FOR EVERY
THROAT IN THE TOWN OF LEE.
>> WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE
CATS?
>> Stephen: AND IF YOU THINK
THEIR FANGS ARE SCARY, LISTEN TO
THIS?
>> I DEFINITELY THINK A CAT
COULD BE TRAINED TO SHOOT A GUN.
I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
INTERMEDIATE STEPS BEFORE
GETTING TO THAT POINT.
>> THE POINT IS THEY COULD DO
IT.
AND WE KNOW WHERE THEY CAN BUY
GUNS.
[GUNFIRE]
>> Stephen: THESE CATS HAVE
FOUND THEIR LEADER IN CRAIG
GRANT, A DANGEROUS MAN WITH
NOTHING TO LOSE.
>> YEAH, I'M GIVING THE REST OF
MY LIFE TO THESE CATS.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
WITH MY REMAINING TIME.
>> Stephen: WILL THE PEOPLE OF
LEE WAKE UP BEFORE IT'S TOO
LATE?
IF THEY DON'T, SOON THIS TOWN
WILL BE NOTHING BUT...

AM
