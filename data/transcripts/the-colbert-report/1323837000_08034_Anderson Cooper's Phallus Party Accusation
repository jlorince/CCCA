(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
WELCOME BACK.
NATION, I AMMAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT
WHEN I AM WRONG.
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, BUT
THAT'S THE THEORY.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT MAKES THIS SO DIFFICULT.
LAST WEEK, MY COVERAGE OF A
VITAL NEWS STORY WAS CALLED INTO
QUESTION BY ONE OF THE MOST
RESPECTED AUTHORITATIVE
INSTITUTIONS IN ALL OF JOURNAL--
THE RIDICULIST PRESENTED BY SEEN
THEN ANCHOR AND CASPER AMERICAN
ANDERSON COOPER.
CNN, OF COURSE, THE MOST TRUSTED
NAME IN NEWS AND THE RDIDICULIST
A TIME HONORED STAPLE IN
JOURNAL.
THE FONT ALONE SCREAMS GRAVITAS.
IT IS THE SAME TYPE FACE USED BY
EDWARD R. MURROW USED DURING THE
BOMBING OF LONDON.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW ANDERSON RIGHTFULLY TOOK ME
TO TASK FOR A STORY I DID ON
DECEMBER 5 ABOUT A RELIGIOUS
CONSPIRACY THEORIST WHO CLAIMS
TO SEE FALL PHALLUSS IN THE
DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT'S
AT WORK.
>> TIME NOW FOR THE RIDICULIST.
COLBERT DID A STORY ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE DENVER
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
>> WHAT IS GOING ON IN DENVER?
NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO CRACK
THE CODE-- UNTIL YOU.
>> PHALLIC SYMBOL.
PHALLIC PHALLIC PHALLIC PHALLIC.
SHAVED PHALLIC.
SOMEBODY'S BUTT.
>> I DID THE STORY THREE
DIFFERENT TIMES SIX MONTHS AGO
ON THE RIDICCULIST IN JUNE.
THAT'S WHEN I DID IT.
JUNE.
I HATE TO SAY THIS, MR. COLBERT,
YOU, SIR, ARE ABOUT SIX MONTHS
TARDY TO THIS PARTICULAR PHALLUS
PARTY.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> GACHL.
AND IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME TO
BELIEVE THAT EVEN ON MY BEST DAY
I COULD BEAT ANDERSON COOPER TO
A PHALLUS PARTY.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S JOURNALISTICETTES 10 1.
ONCE A NEWS ORGANIZATION COVERS
A STORY, IT IS OFF LIMITS TO
EVERY OTHER ORGANIZATION!
THAT'S WHY AFTER WOODWARD AND
BERNSTEIN BROKE THE WATERGATE
STORY, FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SIMPLY RAN
THE HEADLINE: SEE "WASHINGTON
POST."
(LAUGHTER)
ANDER SON COOPER, APOLOGIZE FOR
RIDING YOUR PHALLUS TAILS.
I KNOW HOW PAINFUL THAT MUST BE.
FROM NOW ON I WILL COVER ONLY
STORIES THAT YOU DO NOT--
STARTING WITH THE SHOCKING STORY
ANDERSON COOPER DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT.
THE PHALLIC IMAGERY ON A.C.
3660.
FOR MORE, LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE
PHALLUS FINDER 9600.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE PHALLUS FINDER
9600 WHERE SOMETIMES A CIGAR IS
JUST A BROWN DRY PHALLUS THAT
LOOKS LIKE A SINGH CAR.
FOLLOW ME DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
TO FIND PHALLUS IN WONDERLAND.
NOW, HERE IS A SCREEN GRAB OF
ANDERSON COOPER'S ATTACK ON ME.
BUT, WHAT'S THIS?
A PHALLUS.
(LAUGHTER)
A PHALLUS.
A PHALLUS.
A PHALLUS.
(LAUGHTER)
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
(APPLAUSE)
PHALLUS.
ANOTHER PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
PHALLUS.
I REST MY CASE.
(APPLAUSE)
SO, ANDERSON COOPER, I AWAIT
YOUR RESPONSE.
WHEN I SEE YOU AT THE PHALLUS
PARTY.
DO NOT BE TARDY-- ALSO, WHAT DO
I WEAR?
(LAUGHTER)
