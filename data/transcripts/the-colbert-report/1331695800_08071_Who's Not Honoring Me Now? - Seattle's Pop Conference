>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, NATION, ANYBODY WHO WATCHES
THIS SHOW KNOWS THAT I AM A HUGE
PLAYER IN ROCK 'N' ROLL.
SO NATURALLY I AM FAN OF
SEATTLE'S EXPERIENCE MUSIC
PROJECT.
THE ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSEUM THAT
KEEPS THE MUSIC ALIVE WITH THEIR
ANNUAL CONFERENCE.
IT'S A WEEKEND LONG MUSIC
FESTIVAL IN THE TRADITION OF
WOODSTOCK, BUT UNSTEAD OF
JAMMING TO YOUR FAVORITE BAND,
YOU'RE JAMING TO A SERIES OF
PANEL DISCUSSIONS AND
PRESENTATIONS OF SCHOLARLY
PAPERS.
YOU KNOW THEIR MOTTO: LESS ROCK,
MORE TALK.
WELL, THIS YEAR'S CONFERENCE HAS
SO MANY AMAZING DISSERTATIONS
LIKE, WHEN BOBBY WENT BOB, THE
ASSASSINATION OF R.F.K. AND THE
COLLAPSE OF RING-A-DING URBAN
MASCULINITY, AND I LOVE A PRIDE
PARADE, TEMPORARY SPACES AND
SPLIT SIDES KITSCH AMONG LGBP
MARCHING BANDS.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, I WAS INTO LGBT
MARCHING BANDS WAY BEFORE THEIR
KITSCH BECAME POLITICIZED IN
TEMPORARY SPACES, AND YET,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ONCE AGAIN
THEY HAVE REJECTED MY WORK, SO
IT IS TIME FOR MY AWARD-LACKING
SEGMENT, WHO IS NOT HONORING ME
NOW.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ONCE AGAIN MY SCHOLARLY PAPER
DID NOT MAKE THE CUT THIS YEAR.
THEY HAVE REJECTED SELF-LOVE IN
AN ELEVATOR, APPOLONIAN IMAGES
OF HEDONISM, EROTICISM AND THE
MECHANIZED URBAN LANDSCAPE IN
POST-COMEBACK AEROSMITH.
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.
THEY SAID THAT MY ANTHOLOGY WAS
FALSE AND THEY COULDN'T HEAR A
SICKLE.
ANYWAY, I'LL READ IT TO MY
MUSICAL GUEST TONIGHT OR
