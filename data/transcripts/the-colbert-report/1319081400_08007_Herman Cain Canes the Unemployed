[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT."
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
NATION, THERE WAS ANOTHER
REPUBLICAN DEBATE LAST NIGHT,
WHICH CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE
BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE
PREVIOUS DEBATE HAD ENDED.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS FIRST DEBATE SINCE MY MAN
HERMAN CAIN BECAME THE
REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER.
OF COURSE, MODERATOR AND ARCTIC
CLOUD SPRITE ANDERSON COOPER
WASTED NO TIME TRYING TO CATCH
CAIN WITH THE LIBERAL GOTCHA
TACTIC OF QUOTING SOMETHING CAIN
HAD SAID.
JIM.
>> HERMAN CAIN, I GOT TO ASK
YOU, YOU SAID "DON'T BLAME --
TWO WEEKS AGO YOU SAID, "DON'T
BLAME WALL STREET.
DON'T BLAME THE BIG BANKS.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB AND
YOU'RE NOT RICH, BLAME
YOURSELF."
DO YOU STILL SAY THAT?
>> YES, I DO STILL SAY THAT.
>> STEPHEN: YES, HE DOES.
AND THAT MESSAGE OF HOPE IS SURE
TO RALLY THE NATION'S UNEMPLOYED
TO HERMAN CAIN IF THEY WEREN'T
SO GODDAMN LAZY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND FROM THERE HERMAN CONTINUED
THE CAIN-ING.
>> I STILL STAND BY MY STATEMENT
AND HERE'S WHY: THEY MIGHT BE
FRUSTRATED WITH WALL STREET AND
THE BANKERS, BUT THEY'RE
DIRECTING THEIR ANGER AT THE
WRONG PLACE.
WALL STREET DIDN'T PUT IN FAILED
ECONOMIC POLICIES.
WALL STREET DIDN'T SPEND A
TRILLION DOLLARS THAT DIDN'T DO
ANY GOOD.
WALL STREET ISN'T GOING AROUND
THE COUNTRY TRYING TO SELL
ANOTHER $450 BILLION.
THEY OUGHT TO BE OVER IN FRONT
OF THE WHITE HOUSE TAKING OUT
THEIR FRUSTRATION.
SO I DO STAND BY THAT.
>> STEPHEN: YEAH, UNEMPLOYED,
YOU SHOULD BE OUT IN FRONT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE BLAMING YOURSELF
FOR NOT HAVING A JOB.
[LAUGHTER]
WALL STREET, MAY I REMIND YOU,
WALL STREET HAS NOT CRATERED OUR
ECONOMY IN LIKE TWO YEARS.
THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.
AT THIS POINT WHO CAN EVEN
REMEMBER WHO TOOK WORTHLESS
SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES AND
KNOWINGLY BUNDLED THEM AS
MORTGAGE DERIVATIVES SO THEY
COULD BE SOLD, REBUNDLED AND
RESOLD TO PENSION FUNDS AND
BANKS AROUND THE WORLD UNTIL
THINGS INEVITABLY COLLAPSED,
ANNIHILATING $17 TRILLION,
NATIONAL ECONOMIES, CENTURIES
OLD FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND
THE LIFE SAVINGS OF UNTOLD
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
AND NEITHER CAN HERMAN CAIN.
SO SUCK IT UP, UNEMPLOYED.
IT IS YOUR OWN DAMN FAULT THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHERE ARE ALL
THESE JOBS OBAMA KEEPS
PROMISING?
PEOPLE CAN'T FIND WORK, AND IT
IS ALL THE PRESIDENT'S FAULT.
SO STOP SCAPEGOATING WALL
STREET, WORKERS.
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE PROBLEM THAT
OBAMA CAUSED.
HIS WASTEFUL SPENDING AND
BAILOUTS ARE WHY THESE
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE CAN'T PULL
YOURSELVES UP BY YOUR OWN
BOOTSTRAPS.
YOU WHINERS SHOULD SHUT UP AND
FIX YOUR PROBLEMS THAT OBAMA HAS
DONE NOTHING TO FIX.
BUT HERMAN CAIN WILL FIX THE
ECONOMY AND GET YOU A GOOD JOB
BECAUSE HERMAN CAIN KNOWS THE
BUCK STOPS WITH 999.
