WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," GOOD TO
HAVE YOU.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
SIT DOWN!
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT --
WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A ROCK STAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND, FOLKS, YOU'RE HERE ON A
VERY SPECIAL NIGHT!
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?
THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION.
EVERY NIGHT ON THIS SHOW IS
SPECIAL.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S JUST SAY THAT TONIGHT I AM
SPORTING SOME SERIOUS NORWEGIAN
WOOD BECAUSE --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MY GUEST IS SIR PAUL McCARTNEY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SIR PAUL, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE
MOST SUCCESSFUL AND INFLUENTIAL
SONG WRITERS OF ALL TIME.
UP THERE WITH GILBERT AND
SULLIVAN, ROGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN
LENNON AND McCARTNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
WE ALL KNOW SIR PAUL'S SONGS
"YESTERDAY," "HAY, JUDE"
"ELEANOR RIGBY" "BLACK BIRD "GET
GET BACK" ALL IN ALL, SOME OF
THE MOST TIMELESS SONGS EVER
BOUGHT BY MICHAEL JACKSON.
(LAUGHTER)
IN 2009, THE GUINNESS BOOK OF
WORLD RECORDS NAMED PAUL
McCARTNEY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
SONGWRITER OF ALL TIMES.
HE'S LIKE LEE REDMOND IF HIT
RECORDS WERE FINGERNAILS.
(LAUGHTER)
IN FACT, THE FIRST ALBUM I EVER
BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY WAS
GORDON LIGHT FOOT'S "DON QUIXOTE
♪ THROUGH THE WOODLAND, THROUGH
THE VALLEYS COME THE HORSEMEN
WILD AND FREE ♪
STILL, BLEW MY MIND.
BUT THE SECOND ALBUM WAS "HEY,
JUDE."
THAT'S RIGHT, KIDS, THAT'S
RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE USED TO BUY
MUSIC.
'70s WERE A CRAZY TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
ALTHOUGH HE'S OFTEN CALLED A
LIVING LEGEND, SIR PAUL'S RISE
TO FAME BEGAN AS A SIMPLE TALE
OF A 15-YEAR-OLD LEFT-HANDED
GUITARIST WHO DROPPED BY A
GARDEN PARTY TO SEE THE
QUARRYMEN.
HE JOINED THE BAND THAT BECAME
THE BEATLES THEN CONQUERED THE
WORLD PLANTING APPLE SEEDS WITH
BABE, THE BIG BLUE OX.
EVENTUALLY PAUL LEFT THE BEATLES
TO JOIN THE ARGONAUTS.
(LAUGHTER)
EVENTUALLY THROWING ALL OF HIS
GOLD RECORDS INTO MOUNT DOOM.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR TONIGHT'S
PERFORMANCES.
YOU NAME AN INSTRUMENT AND PAUL
CAN PLAY IT: GUITAR, KEYBOARD,
BASS, DRUMS.
HE'S A ONE-MAN KARAOKE BAR
WITHOUT THE WEIRD VIDEOS OF
KOREAN KIDS STEALING FISH.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, SIR PAUL'S PRESENCE HERE
TONIGHT DOES NOT MEAN I AM GOING
TO RUN TONIGHT'S SHOW ANY
DIFFERENTLY THAN USUAL.
HE MAY BE A GIANT, BUT THIS IS
"THE COLBERT REPORT" NOT THE
McCARTNEY RECARTNEY.
I'M GOING TO TREAT HIM THE SAY
WAY I TREATED LAST NIGHT'S GUEST
AUTHOR DANIEL BERGNER IN THAT I
WON'T READ PAUL'S BOOK, EITHER.
(LAUGHTER)
I-- AND I ALONE-- BUT, BY THE
WAY, BERGNER DID A GREAT
ACOUSTIC SET LAST NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
SHOULD HAVE TAPED IT.
I CALL THE SHOTS IN THIS
BUILDING AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT IS, OKAY?
I LET SIR PAUL KNOW, IT'S A HALF
SHOWER SHOW, WE HAVE TIME FOR
ONE SONG.
HE IMMEDIATELY AGREED TO DO AN
HOUR-LONG SHOW WITH SIX SONGS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW --
(LAUGHTER)
AND I SAID "YES, SIR, SIR."
(LAUGHTER)
SO I TOLD HIM WE REHEARSED AT
5:00 AND TAPE AT 7:00.
THERE'S SIMPLY NO OTHER WAY TO
DO IT.
HE SAID HE HAD TO LEAVE BY 4:00,
WE'LL BE TAPING AT 3:00 WHICH IS
7:00 SOMEWHERE IN THE ATLANTIC
OCEAN SO I CALLED THAT A WIN FOR
OUR SIDE.
I EXPLAINED THE TAPING SO EARLY
WOULD MEAN WE'D NEED HIM HERE
FOR 11:00 A.M. FOR REHEARSAL AND
HE AGREED TO GET HERE WHEN HE
GOT HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AS WITH ANY MUSICAL GUEST WE
HAVE TO SECURE THE BROADCAST
RIGHTS TO THEIR SONGS, CLEAR THE
LYRICS WITH LEGAL AND, OF COURSE
NAIL DOWN OUR LIGHTING AND
CAMERA ANGLES SO I TOLD SIR PAUL
WE ABSOLUTELY HAD NO-NO IN
ADVANCE WHAT SONGS HE'D BE
PLAYING.
HE SAID "I UNDERSTAND
COMPLETELY.
I'LL DECIDE WHEN I GET THERE."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE SHOWED UP, RIGHTING?
HE'S HERE?
OKAY, GOOD.
ANYWAY, YOU PEOPLE ARE THE
LUCKIEST STUDIO AUDIENCE OF ALL
TIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DIG IT.
DIG IT, DADDY-O.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A 150-PERSON
PAUL McCARTNEY CONCERT.
YOU HEAR THAT, OPRAH?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU, OPRAH, YOU AND
