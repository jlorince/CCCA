(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, IT'S ELECTION SEASON HERE IN THE BIG APPLE.
WE'RE CHOOSING A NEW MAYOR TO REPLACE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG WHO--  (LAUGHTER) WHO SADLY WAS LOST IN THE
COUCH CUSHONS AT GRACEY MANSION.
PRIMARIES ARE ON TUESDAY BUT IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE BECAUSE THIS TIME NO ONE IS ADDRESSING THE IMPORTANT
ISSUE OF THE THE-- LAST WEEK NEW YORK FACED A CRISIS THAT COULD TURN THE TIDE OF THIS ELECTION.
>> TWO LOST KITTENS BRING AN ENTIRE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY LINE TO A STAND STILL.
>> TRAIN CREWS SHUT OFF THE POWER.
IT DID HOLD UP TRAINS FOR TWO HOURS, DELAYING THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS.
>> AMERICA'S LARGEST TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BROUGHT TO A SCREECHING HALT, ALL BECAUSE OF THIS FURY DUO.
>> KITTENS, SHUT DOWN SUBWAY SERVICE.
>> Stephen: TUCKER-MEOW RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) THESE SUBWAY KIT KENS PARALYZED TRANSIT SERVICE IN BROOKLYN IT WAS CHAOS.
HUNDREDS OF BROOKLYNNITES WERE STUCK ON THE PLATFORM WITH NOTHING TO INSTA GRAM.
THOUSANDS OF BARISTAS WERE LATE FOR THEIR SHIFTS.
WORSE OF ALL DOZENS OF BANDS WERE INSTANTLY FORMED TO NAME THE SUBWAY KITTENS.
NEW YORK'S MAYORRAL CANDIDATES--  (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: IN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS NEW YORK MAYORRAL CANDIDATES IMMEDIATELY
WEIGHED IN.
A SPOKESMAN FOR SHOCKINGLY CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR BE THONNY WEINER TOLD IF AN ANTHONY SAID IF HE WILL NOT
ONLY STOP TRAINS FOR KITTENS, WILL PERSONALLY CHROIM OVER THE THIRD RAIL TO DO IT.
I FOR ONE BELIEVE ANTHONY WEINER WOULD NEVER HARM A KITTEN THOUGH HE HAS A LONG
RECORD OF CHOKING THE CHICKEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW WEINER'S RESPONSE WAS ECHOED BY FELLOW CANDIDATES CHRISTINE QUEEN, BILL
THOMPSON AND SAL ALBANY WHO SAID WHAT ARE WE NUT, OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE STOPPED.
WE CAN'T JUST GO RUNNING OVER KITTENS.
(LAUGHTER) CAN'T, SAL, OR WON'T?
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE POLITICIAN OUT THERE WITH THE COURAGE TO GREASE OUR TRACKS WITH CAT BABIES.
REPUBLICAN JOE LHOTA WHOSE CAMPAIGN WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE KITTENS RESPONDED THAT
LHOTA DOES NOT THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SHUT DOWN AN ENTIRE TRAIN LINE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD FOR THIS PURPOSE.
FOLKS THIS IS A SHREWD POLITICAL MOVE.
THINK ABOUT IT, LHOTA IS THE ONLY PRO DEAD KITTEN CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE.
OR ANY RACE.
AND I SAY HE SHOULD RUN WITH THIS.
WHAT BETTER WAY TO GRAB ATTENTION THAN WITH YARD SIGNS THAT SAY JOE LHOTA DEAD KITTENS.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN ALL THESE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE JUST GOING TO SPLIT PROT KITTEN VOTERS
LEAVING JOE TO SWEEP UP IN THE KEY ANTI-KITTEN DEMOGRAPHIC OF SOCIOPATH, RATS LARGE ENOUGH TO VOTE
AND ALF.
AND THESE, THESE TWO TROUBLEMAKERS NAMED AUGUST AND ARTHUR HAD IT COMING.
THEY CALL THIS A MAJOR TRANSPORTATION DELAY IN THE LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY MAKING THE BAD, BAD KITTENS.
NOW I WOULD LOVE TO TELL THEM THAT TO THEIR FACE AND I WILL.
PLEASE WELCOME AUGUST ARTHUR AND THE MAN WHO TOOK THEM IN, STEPHEN LEW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THARMTIONS SO-- THANKS SOME OF.
>> LOOK AT THAT, WELCOME, STEPHEN, HOW ARE THE KITTENS DOING?
>> THEY'RE GREAT.
GREAT.
>> ENOUGH OF THAT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE I'M READY TO OPEN DOORS IN THE MAYORRAL RACE AND JOE LHOTA IS LOOKING GOOD.
BUT FIRST SIR, YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO KITTYCIDE, YOU DON'T JUST
TALK THE TALK, YOU EVEN KILL THESE KITTENS.
ANYWAY YOU WANT.
BARRY?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, STEPHEN.
FOR HIS KITTEN KILLING, JOE LHOTA CAN CHOOSE FROM A BAT, A 10 INCH DROP BOARD KNIFE,
HIS CHOICE OF HAMMER, MONKEY WRENCH OR A CLASSIC BURLAP BAG FILLED WITH ROCKS TO
TOSS INTO THE EAST RIVER.
ALL THIS PLUS THE COLBERT BUMP CAN BE YOURS JOE LHOTA IF YOU'LL JUST --
>> KILL THAT KITTEN.
>> Stephen: MR. LHOTA I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU IN MY STUDIO BUT PLEASE TAKE A CAR.
THE SUBWAY IS INFESTED WITH THESE MONSTERS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
