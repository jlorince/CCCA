WITH.
>> IT'S LIKE SERVING A MEAL THATIS SOMETHING LIKE FOOD, LIKE A
HOT DOG.
>> WE'RE PRESENTING SOMETHINGTHAT'S ALMOST LIKE A MOVIE.
BUT IT DOES TEND TO KIND OF...
>> Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKETHAT'S ALMOST AN ATTACK ON
ROMANTIC COMEDIES.
>> IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ONROMANTIC COMEDIES.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS A BIT OFAN HOMAGE, BUT AS KIND OF...
[LAUGHTER]>> Stephen: IT'S AN HOMAGE.
>> IT'S A TOOTHLESS ATTACK BUT AVICIOUS HOMAGE.
>> Stephen: WOW
