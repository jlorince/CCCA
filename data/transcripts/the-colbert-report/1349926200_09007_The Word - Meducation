NATION, IT'S NO SECRET THAT
AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ARE FALLING
BEHIND.
THEY RANK 31st IN MATH
BEHIND SOUTH KOREA, ESTONIA, AND
LUXEMBOURG, WHICH WOULD REALLY
HURT THEIR FEEL FTION THEY
WEREN'T ALSO BEHIND IN
GEOGRAPHY.
AND IT IS PARTICULARLY HARD FOR
CHILDREN IN POOR COMMUNITYS.
ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY,
BLACK CHILDREN LIVING IN
DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS FALL
BEHIND THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE
YEAR OF SCHOOLING SIMPLY BECAUSE
OF WHERE THEY LIVE.
I CAN RELATE.
I HAD TO REPEAT SOPHOMORE YEAR
AT DARTMOUTH, JUST BECAUSE I
LIVED IN EAST WHEELOCK WITH MAD
MATTY B., CHOAD EXPAT NACHO
KING.
THERE WERE TIMES WE COULD BARELY
AFFORD TO PUT SCHIT ON THE
FOOZ BALL TABLE.
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS LACK THE
RESOURCES TO HELP CHILDREN
SUCCEED.
MANY CLASSROOM ALPHABETS ONLY GO
UP TO "R."
A RUE RAGEDY.
NATION, IF WE WANT TO HELP POOR
STUDENTS EXCEL, WE NEED TO
INVEST IN MORE TEACHERS, BETTER
RESOURCES, AND NEWER FACILITIES.
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE SCREWED.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THERE MAY BE A WAY TO HELP
UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS REACH THEIR
FULL POTENTIAL WITHOUT WASTING
TAXPAYER MONEY TO DO IT, AND IT
BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MEDUCATION.
FOLKS, WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING
TO IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, RACE TO
THE TOP, BUT ONE THING WE'VE
OVERLOOKED IS THE MOST OBVIOUS
ANSWER OF ALL-- WONDER DRUGS.
BUT ONE DOCTOR, ONE DOCTOR OUT
THERE IS TRYING.
DR. MICHAEL ANDERSON OF CANTON,
GEORGIA, HAS BEGUN PRESCRIBING
KIDS ADDERRAL WHO HAVE NOT BEEN
DIAGNOSED WITH A.D.H.D.
HE'S DOING IT JUST TO TREAT
THEIR POOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
IN INADEQUATE SCHOOLS.
SHOCKING.
THERE ARE CHILDREN IN AMERICA
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH
A.D.H.D.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, FOR THOSE, FOR THOSE OUT
THERE WHO SAY THIS IS
PRESCRIBING A POWERFUL DRUG FOR
KIDS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE
CONDITION IT TREATS,
DR. ANDERSON HAS A REASSURING
ANSWER.
"I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF
CHOICE.
WE'VE DECIDE AS A SOCIETY IT'S
TOO EXPENSIVE TO MODIFY THE
KIDS' ENVIRONMENT, SO WE HAVE TO
MODIFY THE KIDS."
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF
FIXING SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS BY
MODIFYING CHILDREN.
( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, FOR ONE THING, WE WOULD
NOT HAVE SO MUCH CRIME IF WE
JUST GAVE KIDS LEGAL IMMUNITY
AND REPLACED THEIR WARMS PLASMA
CANNONS.
THE POINT IS, STUDENTS THRIVE
WHEN THEY GET PERSONAL
ATTENTION, AND SINCE WE CAN'T
AFFORD ALL THE TEACHERS IT WOULD
TAKE TO GIVE THEM THAT
ATTENTION, WE'LL GIVE THEM A
PILL THAT HELPS THEM PAY
ATTENTION.
I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T PAY
ATTENTION TO HOW LITTLE
ATTENTION WE'RE GIVING THEM.
AND DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY, FOLKS.
ADDERRAL HELPS KIDS FOCUS.
NOT BECAUSE IT'S SOME
AMPHETAMINE.
BECAUSE IT'S A COMBINATION OF
FOUR AMPHETAMINES.
IT'S LIKE THE COLONEL'S SECRET
RECIPE FOR SPEED
( LAUGHTER )
FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE ANSWER, BUT
WE CAN DO MORE.
I MEAN, WE MIGHT BE CUTTING ARTS
PROGRAMS, BUT ONE TAP OF ACID,
AND YOUR KID WILL BE SEEING
COLORS YOU CAN'T FIND IN A
CRAYOLA BOX.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
OF COURSE WITH ANYTHING HAVING
TO DO WITH SCHOOL, THE REAL
PROBLEM STARTS AT HOME.
MANY CHILDREN FEEL UNWANTED AND
UNLOVED.
BUT ONCE THEY'RE ON ECSTASY,
THEY'LL GET ALL THE NURTURING
THEY COULD EVER WANT JUST BY
NUZZ LING THE DOOR MAT.
( LAUGHTER ).
NOW, OF COURSE, EVENTUALLY, IT
MAY TURN OUT THAT DRUGGING POOR
STUDENT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS
THAN IT SOLVES.
IN WHICH CASE, WE'LL HAVE TO
STOP TRYING TO CHANGE OUR
CHILDREN AND THINK ABOUT
CHANGING OURSELVES.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
.
I FEEL BETTER ABOUT FAILING OUR
KIDS ALREADY.
THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
