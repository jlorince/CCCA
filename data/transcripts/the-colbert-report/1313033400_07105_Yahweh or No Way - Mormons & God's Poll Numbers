[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SOMEBODY IS A LITTLE GIRL.
[LAUGHTER]
FOLKS, CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO
GODLINESS.
WHICH IS WHY I SOMETIMES PRAY TO
MR. CLEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS IS YAHWEH OR NO WAY!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FIRST UP:
MORMONS.
THEY'VE BEEN IN THE NEWS
RECENTLY BECAUSE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, MITT
ROMNEY AND JON HUNTSMAN ARE BOTH
MORMON.
ONE OF THESE GUYS COULD BE OUR
NEXT PRESIDENT.
THE OTHER ONE IS JON HUNTSMAN.
[LAUGHTER]
AND OBAMA'S ADVISERS ARE ALREADY
PLANNING THEIR STRATEGY AGAINST
ROMNEY.
>> WOW, THE OBAMA RE-ELECTION
TEAM SEES MITT ROMNEY AS THE
LIKELIEST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE,
WE'RE TOLD RIGHT NOW.
AND PLANS STRONGLY ATTACK HIM
PERSONALLY AS A PHONY.
AND HERE'S THE KEYWORD, AS
WEIRD.
WHY THAT WORD, WEIRD?
>> WELL, IT'S PSEUDO TO BRING IN
TO THE WHOLE MORMONISM ISSUE.
>> STEPHEN: OBAMA IS GOING TO
USE "WEIRD" AS CODE FOR
"MORMON."
I AM REALLY STARTING TO RESPECT
THAT URBAN RHYTHMIC SOCIALIST
KENYAN SECRET MUSLIM!
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, HE IS RIGHT ABOUT
ROMNEY BEING WEIRD.
LOOK AT THAT HAIR!
DARK, PERFECTLY COMBED WITH A
NEAT PART?
NICE HAIR, WEIRDO!
[LAUGHTER]
PLUS, STRONG JAW, PIERCING GAZE,
YOU JUST KNOW IN HIGH SCHOOL HE
WAS THE WEIRD KID WHO HAD LOTS
OF FRIENDS AND LED THE FOOTBALL
TEAM TO ONE OF THOSE WEIRD STATE
CHAMPIONSHIPS!
THE WEIRDEST THING ABOUT HIM IS
THAT CRAZY RELIGION.
MORMONS BELIEVE JOSEPH SMITH
RECEIVED GOLD PLATES FROM AN
ANGEL ON A HILL.
WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS MOSES, GOT
STONE TABLETS FROM A BURNING
BUSH ON A MOUNTAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY AMERICAN
WHO'S A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF
MORMONS.
>> ACCORDING TO POLLS, JUST 45%
OF PEOPLE HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW
OF MORMONS.
ONLY ATHEISTS AND MUSLIMS RATE
LOWER.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S TRUE.
I DON'T TRUST A MUSLIM AS FAR AS
I CAN THROW HIM AT AN ATHEIST.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THE MORMON CHURCH IS LOOKING
TO CHANGE ITS IMAGE, WITH A PR
CAMPAIGN CALLED "I'M A MORMON."
>> MY NAME IS JOY MONAHAM, I
LIVE IN HAWAII AND I'M A MORMON.
>> MY NAME'S JEFF DECKER.
I'M SCULPTURE FOR HARLEY
DAVIDSON AND I'M A MORMON.
>> I'M A BEE KEEPER.
MY NAME IS MARK CUPERTINI AND
I'M A MORMON.
>> STEPHEN: MOTORCYCLIST SURFING
BEEKEEPERS?
IS THIS A RELIGION OR A NEW SHOW
ON SPIKE?
[LAUGHTER]
SO ARE MORMONS NORMAL?
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
YAHWEH!
♪ ♪
THIS CAMPAIGN IS MAKING MORMONS
IRRESISTIBLY COOL!
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO --
RIDE UNICYCLES,
CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
HAVE GREAT HAIR, OR MAKE OUT
WITH BIRDS?!
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S AWESOME.
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I'M A CATHOLIC!
FIGHT IT!
WE NEED TO FIGHT BACK WITH AN
EVEN COOLER AD CAMPAIGN, LIKE
THIS ONE.
>> OH HI, I'M JASON.
I WAS JUST SKATEBOARDING WHILE
PLAYING THIS GUITAR.
♪ AND FALCONNING
AND I'M A CATHOLIC.
HIGH-FIVE A TIGER!
♪ ♪
IN YOUR FACE MORMONS!
>> STEPHEN: OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.
BY THE WAY, THE TIGER IS ALSO A
CATHOLIC.
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE COULD USE
AN AD CAMPAIGN?
GOD BECAUSE HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE
TERRIBLE.
>> A NEW POLL BY PUBLIC POLICY
POLLING LOOKS AT GOD'S APPROVAL
RATING AND YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE
SURPRISED AT WHAT THEY FOUND.
GOD HAS A 52% APPROVAL RATING.
>> STEPHEN: 52%!
BARELY HALF OF AMERICANS.
OF COURSE, THE PUBLIC'S ALWAYS
TOUGH ON ANY PROMINENT FIGURE
WHO'S HAD A CHILD OUT OF
WEDLOCK.
[LAUGHTER]
AND GET THIS: ONLY 71% APPROVE
OF GOD'S HANDLING OF CREATING
THE UNIVERSE.
THAT MEANS FOR 29%, THE INFINITE
AND UNKNOWABLE EVERYTHING JUST
ISN'T CUTTIN' IT.
[LAUGHTER]
SO DOES GOD DESERVE THESE LOW
NUMBERS?
YAHWEH OR NO WAY?
I DON'T KNOW WEH!
>> EH?
I'M TORN.
ON THE ONE HAND HE IS THE
ALL-POWERFUL, ALL-LOVING SOURCE
OF ALL THINGS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE IS A GAFFE
MACHINE.
FLOODS--
FAMINE--
AIR FRANCE DOESN'T SERVE A
PINOT NOIR OLDER THAN 2001?
WHY HAVE YOU FORESAKEN ME?
