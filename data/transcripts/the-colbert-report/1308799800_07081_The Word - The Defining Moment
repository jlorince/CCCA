>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NATION, TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA
REVEALED HIS PLANS FOR
AFGHANISTAN, AND I TIVO'D IT, SO
DON'T TELL ME HOW THE WAR ENDS.
[LAUGHTER]
WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN CONTINUING
HIS CROWD-PLEASING DEATH, MANY
IN CONGRESS ARE PRESSURING THE
PRESIDENT TO END THE WAR.
UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T JUST
DUMP AFGHANISTAN IN THE OCEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE IS A QUICK WAY OUT OF
THIS WAR, AND IT'S THE SUBJECT
OF TONIGHT'S WORD:
THE DEFINING MOMENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
CONGRESS ISN'T ANGRY ABOUT JUST
AFGHANISTAN, THEY'RE ALSO UPSET
ABOUT LIBYA.
>> THERE IS GROWING BIPARTISAN
FRUSTRATION IN WASHINGTON THIS
MORNING OVER THE PRESIDENT'S
HANDLING OF MILITARY ACTION IN
LIBYA AND HIS DECISION NOT TO
SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM CONGRESS
UNDER THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION.
YOU HAVE MANY MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS, WE'RE TALKING
REPUBLICANS, WE'RE TALKING
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER, BUT ALSO
TALKING A LOT OF LIBERAL
DEMOCRATS, TELLING PRESIDENT
OBAMA THAT THEY THINK HE SHOULD
BE SEEKING CONGRESSIONAL
AUTHORIZATION.
>> Stephen: AT ISSUE HERE IS THE
1973 WAR POWERS RESOLUTION,
WHICH, LIKE MANY THINGS FROM THE
SEVENTIES, IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT
BUT REFUSES TO GO AWAY.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU SEE, BACK THEN, LIBERALS
WERE UPSET BECAUSE PRESIDENT
NIXON WAS SECRETLY BOMBING
CAMBODIA -- AND HE DIDN'T TELL
CONGRESS.
HEY, THE GUY WAS BUSY.
[LAUGHTER]
SO CONGRESS PASSED A LAW
REQUIRING THE PRESIDENT TO
INFORM THEM WITHIN 48 HOURS OF
BEGINNING A MILITARY MISSION,
AND REQUIRED THEIR APPROVAL TO
CONTINUE THAT MISSION PAST
90 DAYS.
WELL, LIBYA'S 90-DAYS WAS UP
LAST WEEK, AND OBAMA TOLD
CONGRESS TO SUCK IT.
[LAUGHTER]
FINAL, FOLKS.
FINALLY, HE'S ACTING
PRESIDENTIAL.
HE SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION DOES NOT
APPLY TO THESE HOSTILITIES
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HOSTILITIES.
>> OUR CURRENT ACTIONS IN LIBYA,
IN THIS MISSION, DO NOT FALL
UNDER THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET THE
THRESHOLD OF HOSTILITIES
ENVISIONED IN THE WAR POWERS
RESOLUTION.
THE MISSION WE'RE ENGAGED IN
DOESN'T MEET THE HOSTILITIES
THRESHOLD.
>> YEAH, IT DOESN'T MEET THE
HOSTILITIES THRESHOLD.
IT ISN'T EVEN HOSTILE.
IT'S MORE LIKE LASER-GUIDING
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.
BESIDES, THERE ARE "NO TROOPS ON
THE GROUND" AND A LOT OF THIS IS
BEING DONE BY "REMOTELY PILOTED
DRONES."
AND THE PILOTS ARE SITTING
SAFELY AT AIR FORCE BASES IN
NEVADA.
[LAUGHTER]
NO AMERICANS ARE IN HARM'S WAY.
IT'S JUST FLYING ROBOTS KILLING
LIBYANS.
YOU KNOW, PEACE, OF COURSE,
[LAUGHTER]
SEC-DEF GATES LIKES TO PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY.
>> WAY I LIKE TO PUT IT IS FROM
OUR STANDPOINT AT THE PENTAGON,
WE'RE INVOLVED IN A LIMITED
KINETIC OPERATION.
IF I'M IN GADHAFI'S PALACE, I
SUSPECT I THINK I'M AT WAR.
>> Stephen: AND IF CONGRESS SAYS
WE'RE AT WAR, THEY'RE SIDING
WITH GADHAFI.
I THINK CONGRESS MIGHT NEED A
LITTLE "LIMITED KINETIC
TALKIN'-TO."
I SAY, INSTEAD OF SOME HALF-ASS
MEASURE LIKE BRINGING HOME
33,000 TROOPS OVER THE NEXT TWO
YEARS, OBAMA COULD END THE
AFGHAN WAR TONIGHT.
BY CALLING IT SOMETHING ELSE.
NOW, "LIMITED KINETIC OPERATION"
IS ALREADY TAKEN, SO AFGHANISTAN
COULD BE CALLED A "TARGETED
ARMAMENT DISBURSEMENT," OR A
"MOBILE TACTICAL MUNITIONS
DEPLOYMENT" OR "A HEAVILY ARMED
SEMESTER ABROAD."
[LAUGHTER]
WHATEVER.
ANYTHING BUT WAR.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, USING THE EXECUTIVE
POWER OF MEANINGLESS SEMANTICS,
PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD END ALL
WARS.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN HE WILL FINALLY HAVE EARNED
HIS NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
OR, MORE ACCURATELY, HIS NOBEL
"LIMITED KINETIC OPERATION"
PRIZE.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
