(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE, IN HERE OUT THERE ANDAROUND THE WORLD
FOLKS, YOU'RE HERE ON A VERYSPECIAL NIGHT BECAUSE, TONIGHT,
WE'RE BRINGING YOU OUR LIVEELECTION SHOW...
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE'LL BE DOINGIT TOMORROW NIGHT
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS PRE-TAPED WHICH IS WHY I
CAN SAFELY SAY, I'M GOING TO BESO (BLEEP) TIRED ON WEDNESDAY.
(LAUGHTER)AGAIN, JOIN US TOMORROW FOR OUR
LIVE ELECTION SPECIAL.
THAT WILL BE AT WHATEVER TIMETHE SHOW IS NORMALLY ON, AND
THEN ONE HOUR EARLIER IN PLACES WHERE FARMERS LIVE.
(LAUGHTER)AND IT WILL BE A BIG NIGHT 'CUZ,
AT THIS POINT, THE CANDIDATESHAVE SAID ALL THAT CAN BE SAID
AND WALKED BACK ALL THEY CANREGRET HAVING SAID.
(LAUGHTER)AFTER MONTHS CAMPAIGNING AND A
RECORD $4 BILLION SPENT,CANDIDATES NOW FACE THEIR
GREATEST CHALLENGE:  GETTINGAMERICANS TO PUT ON SOME PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT.
THAT LOOKS COMFORTABLE.
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YEAH!
YEAH, I KNOW THAT FEELIN'.
WE KNOW IN THE ELECTION GAMEIT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT.
IN THE PAST, THEY'VE TRIED JUSTABOUT EVERYTHING TO GET OUT THE
VOTE -- TV ADS, PHONE BANKS,PAMPHLETTING, BUSING PEOPLE TO
THE POLLS, ROBO-CALLS, EVEN"CAT"-CALLS.
>> HEY, MAMI, DO YOU KNOW WHEREYOUR POLLING PLACE IS?
BECAUSE I CAN THINK OF A GOODPLACE FOR MY POLE.
VOTE SCOTT WALKER, THIS TUESDAY.
>> Stephen: VERY EFFECTIVE.
VERY EFFECTIVE.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
THE PROBLEM WITH ALL THOSEMETHODS IS THAT THEY RELY ON
SOMETHING FEW VOTERS STILLHAVE -- A CRAP TO GIVE.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH IS WHY I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT A BRAND-NEWGET-OUT-THE-VOTE TACTIC.
>> VOTE OR ELSE!
SOME VOTERS ARE BEING SHAMEDINTO CASTING THEIR VOTES.
THEY RECEIVED A LETTER TELLINGTHEM WHETHER 11 OF THEIR FRIENDS
AND ACQUAINTANCES HAD VOTED INTHE LAST THREE ELECTIONS.
>> A POLITICAL GROUP IS TRYINGTO SHAME PEOPLE INTO VOTING.
>> SOME CONSIDER IT A WAY THESHAME PEOPLE TO THE POLLS.
>> A FLYER OF SHAME!
STEPHEN:  YES, A FLYER OFSHAME!
AND THIS TIME IT'S NOT SOMEONESTUCK IN COACH ON UNITED.
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VOTERSARE GETTING FLYERS LIKE THIS ONE
IN MISSOURI, A SO-CALLED "VOTERREPORT CARD" ASSIGNING LETTER
GRADES FOR THEIR AND THEIRNEIGHBOR'S VOTING ATTENDANCE, BY
NAME.
LOOKY HERE, THE GUY ON THEBOTTOM VOTED ONLY 60% OF THE
TIME -- HE GOT A "D."
BETTER GET THOSE GRADES UP,MISTER, OR YOU WILL NEVER GET
INTO ELECTORAL COLLEGE!
THIS IS THE BEST PART --AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRINTING UPNEW FLYERS TELLING EVERYONE IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO VOTED ANDWHO DIDN'T.
SO, PLEASE, BOW TO THISEMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL AND VOTE
TOMORROW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT'S YOUR SACRED DUTY -- IF YOU
AGREE WITH MY POLITICS.
(LAUGHTER)IF YOU DON'T I HEAR THEY'VE GOT
EBOLA IN THERE -- I WOULDN'T GO.
