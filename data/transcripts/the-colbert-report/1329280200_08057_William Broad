(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SCIENCE
WRITER FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
IS IF HE'S ALSO A DEMOCRAT, HE
HAS HIT MY RAGE TRIFECTA.
PLEASE WELCOME BILL BROAD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR.
YOU ARE A TWO-TIME PULITZER
PRIZE-WINNING SCIENCE WRITER FOR
THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
YOU WON TONS OF AWARDS FOR YOUR
WORK ON WRITING ABOUT THE
CHALLENGER SHUTTLE DISASTER,
SPACE WEAPONS, INFECTIOUS
DISEASE, NUCLEAR JIHAD.
NOW A BOOK ABOUT YOGA.
AFTER WRITING ABOUT SUCH TRAGIC
AND DEADLY THINGS WHY WRITE
ABOUT YOGA.
SLOW NEWS YEAR?
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, I DO IT AND IT WORKS.
AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
I CAN DO ALL THIS HARD-EDGE
REPORTING.
BECAUSE IT HELPS ME RELAX.
HELPS ME CENTER.
I GOT HOOKED WHEN I WAS IN
COLLEGE IN 1970 AND I KEPT DOING
IT AND IT HAS GROWN THROUGH MY
CAREER.
IT'S THE COUNTERPOINT TO ALL
THAT BAD STUFF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT.
IT HELPS ME BE A GOOD
JOURNALIST.
>> Stephen: OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOGA.
I SEE PEOPLE DOING IT AND YOU'RE
ALL, LIKE, TWISTED AND
CONTORTED.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE AN
EXERCISE FOR PEOPLE IN COACH ON
AN AIRPLANE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY NOT... WHY NOT JUST... WHAT
IS THE BENEFIT OF IT PHYSICALLY?
I'VE HEARD ABOUT SOMETHING
CALLED YOGA BUTT.
>> YES, YOGA BUTT.
>> Stephen: IS THAT TRUE?
IS THAT A MYTH OR IS THERE
REALLY YOGA BUTT?
>> IT'S IN THERE.
YOGA ISN'T ONE THING, RIGHT?
THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF
THINGS AND I TRY TO PICK THROUGH
WHAT'S THE GOOD AND BAD IN ALL
OF IT.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE GOOD?
>> THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR.
IT LIFTS YOUR MOOD, LIFTS UP
YOUR SEX LIFE AND IS GREAT FOR
HELP.
>> Stephen: GO BACK TO THE SEX
LIFE THING.
YOU HAVE AN ANECDOTE IN HERE YOU
SAY THAT... YOU HAVE AN ANECDOTE
THAT YOGA HAS ENABLE ADD WOMAN
TO HAVE A TWO TO THREE-HOUR
ORGASM.
TRUE?
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE...
>> Stephen: IS THAT TRUE?
>> I DON'T... THAT'S BEEN
REPORTED AND IT'S REPORTED IN
THIS BOOK.
>> Stephen: THE NAME OF THE
BOOK IS "THE SCIENCE OF YOGA."
WHY DIDN'T YOU NAME IT TWO TO
THREE HOUR ORGASM?
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S MOVE SOME PAPERS, SIR!
(APPLAUSE)
>>
>> Stephen:
>> Stephen: IS THAT TRUE.
CAN PEOPLE REALLY CONTROL THEIR
BODY LIKE THAT?
>> TODAY AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY
THERE ARE SCIENTISTS DOING BRAIN
SCANS ON PEOPLE WHO CAN PUT
THEMSELVES INTO EXTENDED STATES
OF ORGASMIC BLISS.
THEY CALL IT THINKING OFF.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHAT
ELSE WILL PUT YOU IN ORGASMIC
BLISS?
AN ORGASM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
WHY NOT TRY SOMETHING NEW?
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THERE ARE... THERE ARE
DANGERS TO YOGA.
I GOT HERE... THIS IS A HUMAN
SPINE.
>> MODEL OF A HUMAN SPINE.
>> Stephen: OH THIS IS NOT
YOURS?
>> NO, OR A FORMER PRACTITIONER.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW IF
YOU DID SO WELL YOU COULD JUST
PULL IT OUT.
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO THE SPINE BY
YOGAIZING?
>> YOGA CAN HELP INCREASE
FLEXIBILITY AND DO ALL KINDS OF
WONDERFUL STUFF, BUT THERE'S
ALSO GREAT DANGER, RIGHT?
ONE OF THE MYTH BUTSING THINGS
THE BOOK DOES IS TALK ABOUT THE
DANGERS RIGHT UP HERE IN THE
NECK REGION.
THERE'S THIS LITTLE ARTERY THAT
GOES THROUGH THERE.
IF YOU START DOING THINGS LIKE
SHOULDER STAND OR PLOW POSITION,
BENDING, YOU CAN TEAR THE INNER
LINING OF THAT DELICATE ARTERY.
CLOTS WILL FORM, THEY'LL GO INTO
YOUR BRAIN.
THE NEXT THING YOU HAVE A
STROKE, RIGHT?
PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN ARE DEAD.
THAT'S A BAD DAY IN THE YOGA
STUDIO.
>> THAT WOULD NOT BE TRANQUIL.
>> IT'S NOT VERY CENTERING.
INSTEAD YOU HERE IN THE
EMERGENCY ROOM OR 1-20 PEOPLE
WHO HAVE THESE KIND OF STROKES
GO TO THE MORGUE.
SO IT'S A SERIOUS THING.
IT'S A A VERY LOW... I DON'T
WANT TO OVERBLOW IT.
IT'S A LOW RISK BUT THE
CONSEQUENCES ARE VERY HIGH.
SO PEOPLE NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
THEY NEED TO PICK AND CHOOSE.
>> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THIS
BIKRAM HOT YOGA.
IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLY POPULAR.
INCREDIBLY HUMID, 120 DEGREES.
JUST LIKE A FUNKY SWEAT PILE.
IS IT TRYING TO REPRODUCE, LIKE,
BEING IN CALCUTTA.
>> CALCUTTA, THAT WAS THE
INSPIRATION.
PEOPLE LOVE IT BECAUSE THEY GET
LOOSE AND FLEXIBLE AND THEY DO
THINGS THEY COULDN'T DO
NORMALLY.
PHYSICIANS WORRY ABOUT IT
BECAUSE THAT FLEXIBILITY ALSO
PRODUCES WOBBLINESS SOMETIMES IN
YOUR JOINTS SO YOU CAN BE MORE
PRONE TO DISLOCATIONS, SPRAINS,
THAT KIND OF STUFF.
>> Stephen: DO YOU WEAR THE
TIGHT STUFF WHEN YOU HERE IN
THERE?
>> NO, I DO YOGA AT HOME IN THE
MORNING IN LOOSE PANTS AND
HAVE...
>> Stephen: AND NOTHING ELSE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I'M NOT GOING INTO THE SORDID
DETAILS.
>> WELL, IT'S BEEN 3,000 YEARS
YOGA'S BEEN AROUND?
>> I THINK FOUR, FIVE.
BUT THE MODERN STUFF,
SURPRISINGLY, THE STUFF THAT WE
DO TODAY WAS ALL DEVELOPED IN
THE 20s AND 30s.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S REAL YOGA?
I'M AN ORIGINALIST.
>> REAL OWE YOGA STARTED OUT IN
A SEX CULT.
TAN TRAY.
>> Stephen: AGAIN!
YOU'VE REALLY BURIED THE LEAD.
BILL BROAD, THE BOOK IS "THE
SCIENCE OF YOGA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
