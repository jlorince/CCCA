( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
CHORS PLAUS.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
FOLKS, BUT I FOR ONE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: I AM REALLY-- REELING FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS FIRST MAY-TOBER SURPRISE.
YESTERDAY'S SHOCKING ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> TODAY I'M SUSPENDING THE CAMPAIGN.
>> Stephen: NEWT GINGRICH HAS LEFT THE RACE!
I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS CAUGHT OFF GUARD SINCE HE ENTERED THE RACE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW NEWT PLEDGED TO ENDORSE MITT ROMNEY AT A LATER DATE.
BUT MITT'S CAMPAIGN MIGHT THINK NEWT SAID ENOUGH ALREADY.
>> ROMNEY IS A GUY WHO WILL MANAGE THE DECAY.
HE'S NOT THE GUY WHO IS GOING TO CHANGE WASHINGTON.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY IS EXTRAORDINARILY INSENSITIVE TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN AMERICA.
>> IF GOVERNOR ROMNEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE BACK ALL THE MONEY HE HAS EARNED FROM
BANKRUPTING COMPANIES AND LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES OVER HIS YEARS AT BAIN, THAT I
WOULD BE GLAD TO THEN LISTEN HIM.
>> ARE YOU CALLING AROMNEY A LIAR?
>> YES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW OBVIOUSLY THIS HEALING IS GOING TO BE A PROCESS.
BABY STEPS.
BUT MITT HAS ALREADY PROVEN HIMSELF A LEADER BY RELEASING THIS GRACIOUS STATEMENT ABOUT THE FORMER SPEAKER.
>> ANN AND I ARE PROUD TO CALL NEWT AND CALISTA FRIENDS.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD.
THAT FROM MITT ROMNEY.
POLITICS IS WEIRD.
AND NOW I KNOW LAST SEASON'S SEASON'S-- ATTACHMENT TO ANYTHING LIKE REALITY.
>> Stephen: AN IS HELP KNOWS ABOUT LOOSE ATTACHMENT TO ANYTHING LIKE REALITY.
HE WORKED WITH FOX NEWS.
BUT MITT AND NEWT KNOW THAT IN POLITICS THESE GUYS RIB,
THEY TEASE, THEY MAKE ROBO CALLS SAYING THE OTHER GUY DENIED KOSHER MEALS TO HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.
BUT IT'S ALL IN GOOD FUN.
THEY'LL PULL IT TOGETHER.
AND NO ONE EXPLAINED THAT BETTER THAN REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST DEE DEE BENKIE.
>> THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAYS,
NEIL, IT'S A SPORTS ANALOGY,
SAY THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOTRE DAME AND THE DEMOCRATS USC.
BIG RIVALRY.
AND NOTRE DAME HAS TO PICK A TEAM CAPTAIN, SO YOU'VE GOT THE FIJI, THE PHI DE WILL
D-- DELTS AND ANOTHER FRATERNITY.
THE OTHER ARE TEAM CAPTAIN THE OTHER TWO ARE MAD, THEY ARE NOT IN A GOOD MOOD FOR
WEEKS BUT THE TIME THIS GAME COMES ALONG, SATURDAY,
FORGET IT.
THE FIGHTING IRISH THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LET TROJAN MAN WIN NO WAY, NO HOW.
PLUS THE OTHER FRATERNITY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO RALLY AROUND THEIR GUY BECAUSE NOW
THEY ARE PART OF THE TEAM SO THAT'S TWO THINGS.
EVERYONE IS PART OF THE TEAM AND THEY HATE THE OTHER TEAM.
>> Stephen: THERE IT.
AS CLEAR AS A FOOTBALL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME YOU OUT THERE MAY NOT BE SPORTS FANS THE WAY
ME AND DEE DEE ARE.
SO LET ME PUT THIS ANOTHER WAY.
IT'S LIKE A STAR WARS ANALOGY.
SAY THE REPUBLICANS ARE THE REBEL ALLIANCE AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE DEATHSTAR.
AND ADMIRAL AKBAR HAS TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING TO FIGHT DARTH VADER.
YOU GOT LUKE SKYWALKER, HANS SOLO AND ANOTHER FRATERNITY.
LET'S SAY THE ROM YOU LUS.
THE GUYS WHO DON'T FLY WITH RED FIVE ARE GOING TO BE PISSED FOR A WHILE, THEY
WILL ALSO BE MAD, THEY WILL WANT TO FLY THROUGH THE STAR GATE ON BATTLE STAR GALACTICA AND TAKE A
VACATION IN CLOUD CITY BUT BY THE TIME THE GAME TIME COMES ALONG THE FIGHTERS
FORGET T THEY DON'T CARE WHO SENDS PROT TON TORPEDO DOWN THE THERMAL EXHAUST PORT AS
LONG AS THEY SAVE YAFAN FOUR,
THEY WANT TO BLOW UP THE DEATHSTAR AND THEY HATE THE DARK SIDE.
OR--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT WORKS.
OR, OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS THE POLITICAL ANALOGY,
REPUBLICANS WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY WILL COME TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO BEAT BARACK OBAMA.
TOO COMPLICATED.
