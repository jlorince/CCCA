ORDER.
(LAUGHTER) THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE NUNS NEED TO LEARN THEIR PLACE.
WHICH IS AT MY DESK.
PLEASE WELCOME THE HEAD OF NETWORK A NATIONAL CATHOLIC SOCIAL JUSTICE LOBBY SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
NOW NOW SISTER, YOU AND YOUR FELLOW NUNS HAVE CLEARLY GONE ROGUE, OKAY.
YOUR RADICAL FEMINISTS.
>> WE'RE CERTAINLY ORIENTED TOWARD THE NEEDS OF WOMEN AND RESPONDING TO THEIR NEEDS.
IF THAT'S RADICAL, I GUESS WE ARE.
BUT ACTUALLY --
>> YES, YES, THAT'S RADICAL FEMINISM.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> NO, NO T IS.
AND BY THE WAY, SISTER WHERE IS THE OUTFIT WHERE.
IS THE OUTFIT?
>> DID YOU BURN IT IN ONE OF THOSE WIVE EL BURNING PARTIES.
>> WE RETURN TO OUR ROOTS.
AND IN OUR HISTORY WHAT WE DRESSED IN WAS THE DRESS OF THE DAY, IN SIMPLE DRESS SO,
THAT'S WHAT WE DO NOW.
WE DRESS IN THE SIMPLE DRESS OF THE DAY IN ORDER TO TOUCH PEOPLE MORE DIRECTLY.
PEOPLE USED TO GET INTIMIDATED BY THOSE BIG HABITS AND ALL THAT AND WE COULD NOT REALLY WALK WITH
THEM IN THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCE.
>> DHUFERN SHOULD BE INTIMIDATING A LITTLE BIT.
>> I MEAN ACTUALLY I THINK YOU NUNS SHOULD BE INTIMIDATE ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE.
THE POPE AND THE VATICAN HAVE SAID KNOCK IT OFF WITH THE SOCIAL LIBERALISM.
YOU'RE NOT SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH.
YOU'LL ADMIT THAT.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY WHAT I WILL ADMIT IS THAT WE ARE FAITHFUL TO THE GOSPEL.
WE WORK EVERY DAY TO LIVE AS JESUS DID IN RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE AT THE MARGINS OF OUR SOCIETY.
THAT'S ALL WE DO.
>> OKAY.
THAT'S A CHEAP APPLAUSE LINE,
JESUS.
YOU CAN THROW JESUS IN TO ANYTHING AND SEEM PEOPLE ARE GOING APPLAUD.
>> WELL, YOU'VE GOT A BUCK TOUR COMING UP.
>> YEAH, WE DO.
>> STARTING THURSDAY.
YOU GUYS, YOU AND SOME OTHER NUNS.
>> CORRECT.
>> A BUNCH OF NUNS ARE GETTING ON THE BUSMENT THAT'S A MOVIE RIGHT THERE.
NUNS ON A BUSMENT AND YOU GUYS ARE REQUESTING TO GO TO NINE DIFFERENT STATES.
>> NINE STATES.
>> TO DIFFERENT PLACES WHERE NUNS ARE DOING.
>> DOING GREAT WORK AND WE'RE GOING TO LIFT UP THEIR WORK BUT WE'RE ALSO STOPPING
AT CONGRESS OFFICES, CONNAL OFFICES ESPECIALLY OF CONGRESS PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THE HOUSE BUDGET
PROPOSED BY CONGRESSMAN RYAN.
AND THAT BUDGET UNDERMINES THE WHOLE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY.
AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IT.
WE WANT TO EDUCATION PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN CONGRESS, AND MAKE SURE THAT
THEY PUSH BACK AGAINST HIJACKING OUR NATION.
>> WELL NOW DOW-- YOU DO REALIZE --
>> IT'S ITS LEAST WE REQUEST DO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING IN THIS ECONOMY
THAT ARE LEFT OUT THAT ARE PUSHED TO THE MARGINS.
>> IF WE'RE JUST CONCENTRATING ON THE POOR,
HELPING THE POOR THAT LEAVES THE RICH OUT.
>> THAT'S WHAT THE RICH SHOULD BE DOING.
>> NO, LISTEN, WE NEED MORE HELP.
THE POOR SHALL INHERIT THE KINGDOM, RIGHT, OF HEAVEN.
CAMPBELL CAN GET THROUGH.
A HAVE A NEEDLE MORE THAN THE RICH MAN CAN GET INTO HEAVEN.
I NEED HELP MORE THAN A POOR PERSON DOES.
>> YOU NEED HELP TO RESPOND,
TO BE GENEROUS.
YOU KNOW THERE IS ENOUGH TO GO AROUND IF WE WOULD ONLY SHARE.
IT'S THIS AMERICAN IDEAL THAT WE SHOULD JUST HORDE AND HOLD ON TO THE
INDIVIDUAL THINGS THAT WE HAVE.
>> JESUS CREATE-- JESUS HIMSELF SAID I GOT MINE JACKED.
>> JESUS BROKE THE BREAD AND GAVE IT TO EVERYBODY AND SAID EAT AND BE FILLED.
AND THERE WAS ENOUGH,.
>> IF YOU SHARE.
>> WELL, I'M TO THE GOING TO DEBATE THE GOSPEL WITH A NUN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S NOT FAIR.
SISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THE HEAD OF NETWORK, A NATIONAL CATHOLIC SOCIAL JUSTICE LOBBY.
SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL.
