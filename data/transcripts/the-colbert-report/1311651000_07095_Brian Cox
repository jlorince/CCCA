EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PARTICLE
PHYSICIST HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS
NEW TV SERIES "WONDERS OF THE
UNIVERSE."
I ALREADY KNOW THREE WONDERS,
STEVIE, BREAD AND WOMAN.
PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN COX.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
BRIAN.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE A SMARTY PANTS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE
OUT THERE JUST HOW SMART YOUR
PANTS ARE.
YOU'RE A PARTICLE PHYSICIST,
ROYAL SOCIETY RESEARCH FELLOW AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER
WHERE YOU HOLD A CHAIR IN
PARTICLE PHYSICS.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PRESENT THE
SECOND INSTALLMENT OF YOUR
PEABODY AWARD-WINNING SERIES
"WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE" JULY
27th, 9:00 P.M. ON THE
SCIENCE CHANNEL.
IT HAS A COMPANION BOOK CALLED
"WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE."
>> YES.
I'LL SETTLE FOR THAT
INTRODUCTION.
THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: WHAT KIND OF
WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
IS THIS LIKE THE SEQUENCE
DESCRIBING THE SHAPE OF A
SUNFLOWER AND THE SHAPE OF A
GALAXY OR LIKE UFOs PAINTED
THE MONA LISA?
WHAT KIND?
>> NEITHER OF THOSE.
>> Stephen: THIS IS BASIC
CABLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
>> IT'S A HISTORY OF THE
UNIVERSE REALLY, A HISTORY OF
WHAT WE KNOW OF THE UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: A SHORT BOOK.
JUST ONE VOLUME?
IT MUST BE IN SONNET FORM.
>> IT'S ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR
13.73 PLUS OR MINUS 0.12 BILLION
YEARS.
>> Stephen: WHO'S COUNTING.
>> THAT TINY BIT.
>> BUT ALSO THE FUTURE OF THE
UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: HOW CAN YOU WRITE
THE FUTURE?
>> WE KNOW ROUGHLY HOW THE
UNIVERSE HAS EVOLVED TO THIS
POINT.
YOU CAN SEND THAT OFF INTO THE
FUTURE AND YOU CAN PREDICT HOW
IT'S GOING TO GO, BUT THE NUMBER
IN THE SERIES, WHICH IS THE
OLDEST THING WE CAN IMAGINE,
WHICH IS A POINT IN THE UNIVERSE
WHEN ALL THE BLACK HOLES, THE
COLLAPSED STARS EVAPORATE AWAY
TO NOTHINGNESS, AND THE NUMBER
IS TEN TO THE POWER OF 100
YEARS.
THAT'S ONE WITH 100 NOUGHTS.
IF I TOOK AN ATOM, ONE, TWO,
THREE, AND STARTED COUNTING.
I'D RUN OUT OF ATOMS ON THE
EARTH VERY QUICKLY.
THERE ARE 100 BILLION STARS IN
THE MILKY WAY GALAXY, 300
BILLION GALAXY IN THE UNIVERSE.
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ATOMS IN
THE ENTIRE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE
TO COUNT UP TO THAT NUMBER,
WHICH IS THE AGE OF THE OLDEST
THING WE CAN IMAGINE IN SCIENCE.
SO IT'S QUITE A BIG STORY, AS
YOU SAY, IN A SMALL BOOK.
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.
>> Stephen: BRIAN CONGRESS,
WILL YOU LIE ON A HILLSIDE WITH
ME AT NIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
STAIR - STARE UP AT THE SKY?
I GOT A CHILL, AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
THAT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
>> I SAW YOU BEGIN WITH THE
CALENDAR.
IT SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN TO YOU.
>> Stephen: THEY CAN COME TOO.
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU ALSO WERE
CONCERNED IN GENEVA.
IT'S A BIG PARTICLE ACCELERATOR
THERE.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING
CALLED THE HAGUES BOZON
PARTICLE.
EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS.
>> IT'S A THEORETICAL THING THAT
WE THINK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MASS
IN THE UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: SUBATOMIC?
>> SUBATOMIC PARLIAMENT.
WHY DOES THIS TABLE HAVE MASS.
>> Stephen: IT'S WOOD.
IT'S MADE OF WOOD.
GO AHEAD.
NEXT QUESTION, PHYSICS MAN.
>> WE NEED NOT BOTHER BUILDING
THIS THING.
SO IT'S A PARTICLE THAT WE THING
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT,
GENERATING MASS IN THE UNIVERSE.
>> Stephen: IT GIVES MASS TO
THINGS.
>> TO EVERYTHING.
LAST TIME I WAS ON WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT IT, AND THERE WERE
THEORIES ABOUT PEOPLE COMING
BACK FROM THE FUTURE.
IT WAS ALL NONSENSE.
I THINK BOLLOX WAS THE WORD I
USED.
AS OF LAST WEEK, WE MIGHT SEE
HINTS OF IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
>> Stephen: HINTS OF?
>> THIS THING, THIS PARTICLE.
IT MAY WELL EXIST.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEAN
TO FIND THIS?
>> IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF
OUR THEORY OF EVERYTHING IN THE
UNIVERSE OTHER THAN GRAVITY.
SO EVERY PHENOMENON,
ELECTRICITY, MAGNETISM, THE WAY
NUKE LEE EATS STICK TOGETHER.
THE HEART OF THE THEORY IS THIS
THING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR
DECADES.
>> ARE THERE OTHER THINGS WE'RE
LOOKING FOR THAT WE CAN'T FIND
AT THAT LEVEL?
>> NO, THIS IS IT.
>> YOU DID THE 500
>> PIECE JIGSAW PUZZLE OF THE
CORAL REEF.
YOU CAN'T FIND THAT LAST PIECE.
>> AND THERE ARE HINTS ALSO IN
CHICAGO.
THERE ARE ALSO HINTS IN ROUGHLY
THE SAME KIND OF PLACE.
SO IT MAY BE A VERY EXCITING
TIME OF...
>> Stephen: ARE YOU CONFIDENT?
YOU'RE A PHYSICIST.
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT WHAT YOU
KNOW YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE LET'S JUST SAY THAT
PEOPLE COULD TRAVEL IN TIME AND
THAT I'M FROM 500 YEARS IN THE
FUTURE.
OKAY.
AND I'M JUST STEPHEN FROM 500
YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND I'M
COMING BACK THE TAKE HIS PLACE.
IF I SAID TO YOU, YOUR PHYSICS
ARE SO WRONG, THEY'RE SO
PRIMITIVE, THEY'RE LIKE THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT THE IDEA THAT THE
SKY IS A SERIES OF, YOU KNOW,
CONCENTRIC SPHERES, YOU KNOW,
UPON WHICH THE STARS ARE PINNED,
LIKE THAT'S HOW PRIMITIVE YOUR
PHYSICS ARE, COULD YOU CONCEIVE
OF THAT BEING TRUE?
>> YEAH.
PHYSICS, THROUGHOUT HISTORY,
SCIENCE A IS A SERIES... IT'S A
SNAPSHOT OF OUR BEST
UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE AS IT IS
NOW.
THE KEY TO IT, THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN IT AND EVERY OTHER
BELIEF SYSTEM IS THERE IS NO
SENSE IN WHICH IT'S RIGHT.
THERE ARE NO ACTS YUMS THERE
WHICH ARE UNSHAKABLE.
>> SO WE SPEND BILLIONS TO FIND
THIS, IT COULD SNAP IN THERE,
EVERYTHING WOULD WORKS, WE'D
CALL TITD THEORY OF EVERYTHING.
>> IT WOULD BE ON THE WAY TO
THAT.
>> Stephen: AND THEN SOMETHING
ELSE COULD HAPPEN AND YOU GO,
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHUCK IT ALL.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: TURN OVER THE
CHESSBOARD.
>> AND THAT'S THE POWER.
I CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING,
BUT THAT'S THE POWER.
>> Stephen:, NO ONLY YOU CAN
SEE WHERE IT'S GOING BECAUSE YOU
CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE.
WHERE IS IT GOING?
>> WELL, I MEAN...
>>
>> Stephen: YOU'RE ABOUT TO
ADMIT SOMETHING, AREN'T YOU?
YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST MAKING THIS
[BLEEPED] UP AS YOU GO ALONG.
>> LET'S MOVE ALONG.
IT'S WONDERFUL.
THE UNIVERSE IS...
>> Stephen: THE UNIVERSE IS A
WONDER, AND HIS BOOK "WONDERS OF
THE UNIVERSE" IS OUT NOW.
BRIAN COX'S PROGRAM, THE WONDERS
OF THE UNIVERSE, BEGINS
WEDNESDAY ON SCIENCE.
CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S AS WONDERFUL AS THE
UNIVERSE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
