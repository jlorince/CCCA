I'LL ASK HIM WHICH IS THE BIGGERQUAGMIRE.
PLEASE WELCOME JAMES WEBB.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]SENATOR, SENATOR, SECRETARY,
YOUR EXCELLENCY, WHICH ONE DOYOU WANT MORE, BY THE WAY, DO
YOU WANT SECRETARY, SENATOR?
WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT?
>> JIM.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A NICETITLE.
IS THAT SHORT FOR SOMETHING?
NOW, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
THIS IS TWO, THREE, FOUR, IDON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU
HAVE BEEN ON THE SHOW. IALWAYS LIKE
HAVING YOU ON BECAUSE YOU'RE AREAL REAGAN MAN.
YOU WERE REAGAN'S SECRETARY OFTHE NAVY, CORRECT?
>> RIGHT.
>> DID YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUTTHAT FOR A SECOND?
>>WELL I'M A LITTLE BIT MORETHAN A REAGAN MAN.
BUT I DID ADMIRE HIM A LOT.
>> Stephen: WHAT COULD BEBETTER THAN A REAGAN MAN?
WERE YOU THERE WHEN HE PUNCHEDTHE BERLIN WALL DOWN?
>> NO.
I THINK HE DID THAT WITHOUT MYHELP.
>> OK GOOD.  A FORMER SENATOR INVIRGINIA.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVYUNDER REAGAN.
YOU'VE WRITTEN TEN BOOKS.
MOST RECENTLY YOU HAVE A NEWMEMOIR CALLED "I HEARD MY
COUNTRY CALLING."
WHEN YOUR COUNTRY CALLED, WHATDID YOUR COUNTRY SAY TO YOU?
AND DID YOU PICK UP FIRST TIMEOR DID YOU PUSH "DECLINE."
>> ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT WEHAVE TO WORRY A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE MAKEOUR CALLS AND OUR COUNTRY IS
LISTENING, THE N.S.A.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THAT KEEPSUS SAFE YOU MEAN.
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU ATERRORIST?
>> NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
>> Stephen: NOT THAT YOU KNOWOF.
>> NOT THAT I KNOW OF BUTWE'LL SEE WHAT N.S.A. COMES UP
WITH WHEN THEY RELEASE THESEDOCUMENTS.
>> YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE, YOUHAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ANYWAY.
>> Stephen: OKAY. WELL IT'S BEENLOVELY TO HAVE YOU
GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE.
OK, YOU LIVED A LIFE OF SERVICETO THE COUNTRY.
WHICH SERVICE YOU'VE GIVEN TOTHE COUNTRY, WHETHER IN
GOVERNMENT OR IN THE MILITARY,HAS BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU?
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THATI THINK I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO
DO FOR OUR COUNTRY IS SERVE ASA MARINE IN VIETNAM.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THERE'S NO... THERE NO
GREATER HONOR THAN TO HAVE BEENABLE TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE
LIVES OF AMERICANS WHEN THEY'REAT RISK.
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF MY SON FORHAVING SERVED AS A MARINE IN
IRAQ TOO, BY THE WAY.
[APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE ON A
COUPLE TIMES BEFORE RUNNING FORSENATE AND AS A SENATOR, YOU
WORE YOUR SON'S COMBAT BOOTSWHILE HE WAS OVER THERE.
DID HE GET BACK SAFE?
>> HE DID.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO HEAR IT.
GOOD TO HEAR IT.
>> ALSO I'M REALLY PROUD FROMTHE TIME I ENTERED THE SENATE,
WE INTRODUCED THE POST-9/11 G.I.
BILL, WHICH IS THE BEST G.I.
BILL OUR VETERANS HAVE EVER HADIN OUR HISTORY.
AND THAT WAS GREAT MOMENT IN'08.
I WOULD THINK I WAS ON YOUR SHOWSHORTLY THEREAFTER.
SINCE THAT TIME MORE THAN AMILLION VETERANS FROM IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN ABLE TOGET A BETTER EDUCATION AND
IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.
[APPLAUSE]>> Stephen: NOW, YOU WERE ABLE
TO DO THAT.
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THINGSDONE IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW, BUT
YOU WERE ABLE TO GET THAT G.I.
BILL THROUGH WITHOUT, YOU SAY,CUTTING A LOT OF POLITICAL DEALS
TO GET IT DONE.
>> WE DIDN'T CUT DEALS, BUT ITWAS NOT AN EASY LIFT.
LOOKING BACK ON IT, IT SEEMSLIKE A NO-BRAINER TO BE ABLE TO
GIVE THESE PEOPLE WHO SERVED,THEIR TUITION, BUY THEIR BOOKS,
GIVE THEM A STIPEND LIKE WE DIDFOR THE WORLD WAR II VETERANS,
BUT WE WERE OPPOSED ALL THE WAYTO THE VERY END BY THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU, IFYOU WERE IN THE SENATE, NOT AN
EASY CLUB TO GET INTO, AND YOUWERE ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE YOU
BELIEVE IN, WHICH ISN'T EASY TOGET DONE, WHY WOULD YOU NO
LONGER WANT TO BE ONE OF THE 100
MOST POWERFUL MEN OF THE UNITEDSTATES?
>> I THINK IT'S HEALTHY TO TAKEA STEP AWAY.
I'VE DONE IT FOUR TIMES IN MYLIFE.
I'VE SERVED FOR A WHILE. THEN ILEAVE AND GO WRITE
AND DO JOURNALISM AND THOSEKINDS OF
THINGS AND THEN COME BACK IN.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU THINKINGABOUT STEPPING BACK IN BECAUSE
THERE IS SPECULATION YOU WILL BETHE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO ANNOUNCE
HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT IN2016.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE THATSPECULATION IS COMING FROM, BUT
I'M GLAD...
>> RIGHT HERE.
YOU SAID YOU WOULD NOT MAKE AVERY GOOD VICE PRESIDENT.
YOU SAID YOU WOULD NOT MAKE AVERY GOOD VICE PRESIDENT, AND
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU TOP OUTAT SENATOR OR THAT YOU'LL ONLY
TAKE PRESIDENT?
THERE'S NOTHING IN BETWEEN.
>> IF I WAS GOING TO BEANNOUNCING FOR THE PRESIDENCY
TONIGHT, I WOULD AT LEAST HAVEWORN A TIE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE][AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
>> Stephen: I'LL WAIT.
>> I WOULD LIKE YOUR PAC LISTBY THE WAY.
>> Stephen: IF I GAVE YOU MYSUPER PAC LIST, THAT WOULD BE A
FEDERAL OFFENSE, FOR WHICHNEITHER OF US WOULD BE PUNISHED
IN ANY WAY. SENATOR WEBB THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
SENATOR JAMES WEBB, "I HEARD MYCOUNTRY CALLING."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU, SENATOR.
