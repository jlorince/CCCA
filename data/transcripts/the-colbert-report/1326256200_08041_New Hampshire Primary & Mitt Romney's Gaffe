[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO "THE REPORT."
THANK YOU
[AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
COME ON.
REALLY?
I TELL YOU, FOLKS, I COULDN'T
HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.
[LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, HUGE NIGHT.
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY IS
FINALLY HERE.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO WON.
NORMALLY I BROADCAST LIVE AT
11:30, BUT ONCE AGAIN I AM
TAPING MY SHOW AT 7:00,
SACRIFICING REPORTING THE
RESULTS OF THE ALL-IMPORTANT NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY SO I CAN GET
AN EARLY START PREPARING FOR THE
EVEN ALLER-IMPORTANT SOUTH
CAROLINA PRIMARY, WHICH MOST
EXPERTS AGREE IS EXTREMELY NEXT.
[LAUGHTER]
IT IS JUST TWO WEEKS AWAY, WHICH
MEANS I HAVE TO GET HOME TO PUT
MY PIG IN THE SMOKER TONIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
THE SECRET TO MY SAUCE IS TO AGE
IT UNDER A WANING MOON.
NONE OF THAT NORTH CAROLINA
WAXING MOON BULL [BLEEPED].
IT TAINTS THE MEAT, PARTICULARLY
THE TAINT MEAT.
NOW, BESIDES, I CAN ALREADY CALL
NEW HAMPSHIRE.
IT WAS OVER AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE
TOWN OF DIXVILLE NOTCH,
POPULATION NINE, ANNOUNCED THEIR
RETURNS.
>> WE HAVE A COUNT, AND IT GOES
AS FOLLOWS: TWO VOTES FOR JON
HUNTSMAN AND TWO VOTES FOR MITT
ROMNEY.
IT'S A TIE.
MITT ROMNEY WITH TWO, JON
HUNTSMAN WITH TWO.
>> Stephen: A 2-2 TIE.
UNPRECEDENTED.
AND REMEMBER, THE WINNER OF THE
DIXVILLE NOTCH HAS GONE ON TO BE
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN EVERY
ELECTION SINCE 1960, WHICH MUST
MEAN THAT THE 2012 REPUBLICAN
NOMINEE WILL BE MITT ROMNEY AND
JON HUNTSMAN STITCHED TOGETHER
IN A HUMAN CENTI-G-O-PEDE.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
YOU SEE, THE BACK CANDIDATE IS
STITCHED ON TO THE FRONT ONE'S
LET'S SAY DIXVILLE NOTCH.
THE QUESTION IS, AND IT'S THE
ONLY QUESTION, WHO WILL BE THE
HEAD?
THE SMART MUST BE'S ON ROMNEY.
ACTUALLY, ALL THE MONEY'S ON
ROMNEY.
IN FACT, ROMNEY'S ONLY GOT ONE
TINY VULNERABILITY, THE YEARS HE
SPENT AS A HEARTLESS CORPORATE
RAIDER AT BAIN CAPITAL
EXTRACTING MILLIONS FROM
TROUBLED COMPANIES BY TAKING
THEM OVER, FIRING THEIR WORK
FORECAST AND THEN CHOPPING THEM
UP TO SELL THE PIECES TO THE
HIGHEST BIDDER WITH NO REGARD
FOR THE LIVES DESTROYED.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THAT'S ALL THE PAST.
MITT WILL BREEZE TO THE WHITE
HOUSE AS LONG AS HE NEVER
REMINDS VOTERS WHAT BAIN CAPITAL
DID.
>> I LIKE BEING ABLE TO FIRE
PEOPLE THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO
ME.
[SCRATCHING RECORD NOISE]
>> Stephen: WHAT?
[SCRATCHING RECORD NOISE]
GLAD I HAD MY TURNTABLE HERE.
BOY, ROMNEY REALLY STUCK HIS
FOOT IN HIS MOUTH WITH THIS ONE,
WHICH IS THE SPICIEST THING HE'S
EATEN IN YEARS.
AND, OF COURSE, OF COURSE THE
MEDIA AND THE OTHER CANDIDATES
HAVE JUMPED ON MITT LIKE NEWT
GINGRICH ON A YOUNGER, HEALTHIER
WIFE.
[APPLAUSE]
JIM?
>> ON A DAY THAT'S PRETTY
IMPORTANT FOR THE ROMNEY
CAMPAIGN, HE MAKES ONE OF THE
BIGGEST GAFFES POSSIBLE AND
JOKES ABOUT HOW MUCH HE ENJOYS
FIRING PEOPLE.
>> IT'S A DEEPER COMMENT ABOUT
HOW HE THINKS.
>> IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT
HE SEARCHLY DOES NOT CAREMENT
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY ENJOYS FIRING
PEOPLE.
I ENJOY CREATING JOBS.
>> HUNTSMANS DOES HAVE A GOOD
TRACK RECORD THERE.
FOR TWO YEARS HE WAS AMBASSADOR
TO CHINA, AND THEY'VE ADDED
MILLIONS OFFING JOBS.
BUT FOLKS, THESE ATTACKS ARE
UNFAIR.
AS ROMNEY EXPLAINS.
>> THINGS CAN ALWAYS BE TAKEN
OUT OF CONTEXT, BUT AS YOU KNOW,
I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT INSURANCE
COMPANIES.
>> Stephen: YES, MITT WAS
TALKING ABOUT GIVING INDIVIDUAL
CITIZENS THE RIGHT THE FIRE
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH
WOULD HURT THOSE COMPANIES
PROFIT, MAKING THEM VULNERABLE
TO TAKEOVER.
THEN MITT COULD ENJOY FIRING
THOSE PEOPLE.
IN CONTEXT.
AND THIS TAKING ROMNEY'S WORDS
ABOUT INSURANCE OUT OF CONTEXT
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN
ROMNEY PUT OUT AN AD TAKING
OBAMA'S WORDS ABOUT JOHN
McCAIN OUT OF CONTEXT LAST
NOVEMBER.
THAT WAS FAIR.
AS ROMNEY EXPLAINED.
>> WHAT'S SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE IS
NOW SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
>> Stephen: YES, SAUCE FOR THE
GOOSE IS NOW SAUCE FOR THE
GRANDER.
OKAY.
AND EVERYONE KNOWS YOU CAN'T PUT
GANDER SAUCE BACK ON THE GOOSE.
IT'S ALL GANDER-Y NOW.
IF A CHEF DID THAT TO ROMNEY'S
GOOSE, HE WOULD FIRE HIM.
AND ENJOY IT.
