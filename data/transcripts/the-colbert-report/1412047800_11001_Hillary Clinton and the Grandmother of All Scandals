BUT FOLKS, WHETHER OR NOT OBAMAIS UP FOR DIDDING THE JOB, WE
KNOW THAT AFTER 2016, BARACKOBAMA WILL BE LEAVING OFFICE.
WEAK MOVE, MR. PRESIDENT.
NEVER ANNOUNCE A TIMETABLE FORWITHDRAWAL!
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, THE POWER VACUUM HE
LEAVES BEHIND MAY BE FILLED BYHILLARY CLINTON, AN UNSTOPPABLE
FORCE ON AN INEVITABLE PATHTOWARDS MAYBE ANNOUNCING A
CANDIDACY SOMEDAY.
(LAUGHTER)AND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT THIS
WEEKEND MAKES HER EVEN MOREMAYBE.
>> IT'S A GIRL.
A GIRL FOR CHELSEA CLINTON ANDHER HUSBAND MARC MEZVINSKY.
CHARLOTTE CLINTON MEZVINSKY.
>> IT'S THE FIRST CHILD FORCLINTON AND HER HUSBAND MARC AND
THE FIRST GRANDCHILD FOR THEFORMER PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY
OF STATE.
>> STEPHEN: YET ANOTHERHILLARY FLIP-FLOP.
FOUR DAYS AGO, SHE WASN'T AGRANDMOTHER,
NOW SHE CLAIMS SHE IS.
HOW CAN WE TRUST HER? IT GETS TOBASIC ISSUES HERE.
(APPLAUSE)NOW, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT
TO CONGRATULATE THE HAPPYFAMILY.
CHARLOTTE IS A BEAUTIFUL BABY --HOPE YOU KEEP HER AS FAR AWAY
FROM PARTISAN POLITICS ASHUMANLY POSSIBLE.
BUT I JUST GOTTA SAY,"CHARLOTTE"?
KIND OF SUSPICIOUS SHE WAS NAMEDAFTER THE LARGEST CITY IN A
MAJOR SWING STATE.
(APPLAUSE)>> STEPHEN: IF IT HAD BEEN A
BOY, WOULD WE BE CELEBRATING THEBIRTH OF LITTLE BABY AKRON?
AND I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THEELEPHANT IN THE ROOM -- BY WHICH
I MEAN ALL THE ELEPHANTS IN THEROOM.
>> THE BABY REPORTEDLY HAS ANELEPHANT-THEMED NURSERY.
>> THE NURSERY WILL BE DECORATEDWITH ELEPHANTS, OF COURSE, THE
MASCOT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> STEPHEN: YES, A NURSERYDECORATED WITH ADORABLE
REPUBLICAN ELEPHANTS.
THEY BORROWED THE DESIGN FROMPAUL RYAN'S BEDROOM.
(APPLAUSE)AND YOU KNOW IT'S A CYNICAL PLOY
TO APPEAL TO REPUBLICAN-LEANINGSWING VOTERS BECAUSE IT WAS
PREMEDITATED.
RIGHT BEFORE HER BABY WAS BORN,CHELSEA CLINTON CONVENIENTLY
HELPED LAUNCH A LINE OFELEPHANT-THEMED GIFTS TO BENEFIT
GROUPS WORKING TO STOP THEPOACHING OF AFRICAN ELEPHANTS.
A LIKELY STORY.
NO ONE POACHES AFRICANELEPHANTS.
THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER FRIED.
(LAUGHTER)>> STEPHEN: OH, THEY ARE.
HEAR THE AUDIENCE GOING, MMM!
MMM!
WELL, AS CUTE AS BABY CHARLOTTEIS, HILLARY'S ROAD TO THE WHITE
HOUSE IS ABOUT TO BE DERAILED BYTHE GRANDMOTHER OF ALL SCANDALS.
BECAUSE FREEBEACON.COM -- YES,"THAT" FREEBEACON.COM -- HAS
UNCOVERED A SINGLE LETTERHILLARY SENT IN 1971 TO NONE
OTHER THAN SAUL ALINSKY.
YES.
SAUL ALINSKY.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)YES, AS YOU CAN TELL, A NAME
INSTANTLY FAMILIAR TO ANYONECURRENTLY WATCHING THIS IN
THE MIDDLE OF A SOCIOLOGYLECTURE ABOUT SAUL ALINSKY.
ALINSKY WAS NOT ONLY A DANGEROUSFAR-LEFT SOCIAL ACTIVIST KNOWN
FOR HIS BOOK "RULES FORRADICALS," HE WAS ALSO THE MAN
WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.
(LAUGHTER)THIS HILLARY LETTER IS
DEVASTATING FOR CLINTON.
AFTER ALL, ALINSKY WAS ACOMMUNITY ORGANIZER FROM
CHICAGO -- A DEATH SENTENCE FORANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE
PRESIDENT.
PLUS, I'M PRETTY SURE BILLCLINTON HAD AN AFFAIR WITH
ALINSKY'S DAUGHTER, MONOCLE.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
AND HILLARY'S CLEAR DEEPRADICALIZATION AND CLOSE TIES TO
ALINSKY ARE MADE ACHINGLY CLEARBY THE WAY SHE ASKS WHEN HIS
BOOK WAS COMING OUT, AND THATSHE MISSED THEIR BIENNIAL
CONVERSATIONS.
TYPICAL LIBERAL DEVIANCE.
EVEN THEIR TIME FRAMES ARE BI.
BUT THE MOST SHOCKING THINGABOUT HILLARY'S PEN PAL
SCANDAL -- OR "PEN-GHAZI" ASI'M CALLING IT -- IS
HOW FEW PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED BYIT.
TAKE IT FROM CONSTANTLY SHOCKEDJOCK RUSH LIMBAUGH.
>> A LOT OF DRIVE-BY MEDIAPEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
FASCINATED BY THE EVENTS THEYCOVER...
ARE NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST CURIOUSABOUT A BUNCH OF OLD LETTERS
THAT HILLARY CLINTON WROTE, WAYBACK WHEN, HAVE SURFACED...
IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS SENDINGLETTERS TO ALINSKY LEFT AND
RIGHT.
>> STEPHEN: YES, HILLARY WASWRITING ALINSKY LEFT AND RIGHT.
IN THAT HER SINGLE NOTE TO HIMCONTAINS A BUNCH OF LETTERS
THAT ARE READ FROM LEFT TORIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)THIS IS JUST PROOF THAT EVEN
THOUGH SHE'S BEEN SCRUTINIZEDFOR DECADES AS SECRETARY OF
STATE, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,SENATOR AND FIRST LADY -- BUT
THERE'S SO MUCH WE STILL DON'TKNOW ABOUT HER.
FOR INSTANCE, I WENT EVENFURTHER BACK INTO HER MYSTERIOUS
PAST AND OBTAINED A LETTERHILLARY WROTE IN 1953.
IT PROVES SHE WAS INCOMMUNICATION WITH A FOREIGN
LEADER.
IT STARTS "DEAR SANTA."
I BELIEVE THAT'S A SPANISH NAME!
(LAUGHTER)SHE GOES ON TO COLLUDE WITH THIS
REDCOAT KNOWN FOR SUPPORTINGSLAVE LABOR AND THE EXCLUSION OF
JEWS.
(LAUGHTER)THEN HILLARY PROVES HER
SOCIALIST BONAFIDES BY DEMANDINGAN ITEMIZED LIST OF FREE
HANDOUTS.
AND NO SURPRISE SHE ENDS THELETTER BY ATTACKING AMERICA'S
ENERGY PRODUCERS:  "P.S.  PLEASEDON'T PUT COAL IN MY STOCKING."
(LAUGHTER)>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
