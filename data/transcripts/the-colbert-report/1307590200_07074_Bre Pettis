EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
CO-FOUNDER OF A MACHINE WHO
PRINTS THREE DIMENSIONAL COPIES.
PLEASE WELCOME BRE PETTIS.
HEY.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
OKAY.
OKAY, SIR, YOU ARE THE
CO-FOUNDER OF MAKER BOUGHT.
>> THAT IS A MAKER BOT RIGHT
THERE.
>> Stephen: BY 3-D PRINTING,
YOU MAKE A COPY OF A THREE
DIMENSIONAL OBJECT AND YOU CAN
SEND THAT INFORMATION, YOU KNOW,
LIKE OVER THE WIRE, OVER
TELEGRAPH MACHINE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEN SOMEBODY GETS THIS ON
THEIR COMPUTER, AND THAT CAN PUT
THAT INFORMATION INTO A MAKER
BOT AND MAKE A COPY OF SOMETHING
HALF A WORLD AWAY.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING IN THERE
RIGHT NOW?
>> YOUR HEAD.
>> Stephen: TWO DAYS AGO YOU
CAME HERE WITH LASERS AND PUT
CORN STARCH ON MY HEAD AND THEN
SCANNED MY HEAD TO GET A THREE
DIMENSIONAL RENDERING OF MY
FACE, AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT
LIVE RIGHT THERE.
>> RIGHT THERE.
>> Stephen: YOU MADE A FEW
ALREADY.
THIS IS ONE RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT THAT.
THEY EVEN... YOU EVEN GOT THE
COLOR RIGHT.
THIS SEEMS TO HAVE UNBELIEVABLE
IMPLICATIONS.
THIS IS AN ACTUAL 3-D RENDERING
OF MY HEAD YOU MADE SMALL.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T
REPRODUCE?
>> IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE HAVING MAKER BOT MEANS YOU
CAN MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING FROM
LIKE A BATHTUB TO A BIRTHDAY
PRESENT.
SO IT'S PRETTY HANDY ACTUALLY.
>> Stephen: THE THING THAT
GETS ME, THIS MATERIAL, THIS IS
PRETTY TOUGH.
WHAT IT IS?
>> IT'S ABS, THE SAME MATERIAL
LEGO IS MADE OUT OF.
IT'S STRONG.
>> Stephen: RIGHT NOW WE RELY
ON THE CHINESE FOR OUR LITTLE
PLASTIC PIECES OF CRAP.
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]
NO LONGER.
>> Stephen: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
RELY ON THE CHINESE FOR YOUR
PLASTIC PIECES OF CRAP BECAUSE
WHAT'S CHEAPER THAN A CHINESE
WORKER, A ROBOT.
ALL WE NEED IS THE DESIGN AND
THEN MAKER BOT WILL MAKE IT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH DOES THIS
COST?
>> THIS IS $1,2 9.
THEN YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING UP TO
ABOUT THIS SIZE.
>> Stephen: SOME OTHER THINGS
YOU MADE, MY HEAD AS AN EAGLE.
WITH THE CAPITAL DOME IN ITS
CLAWS.
THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY QUITE
TERRIFYING.
THAT'S ME AS A TEDDY BEAR.
OKAY.
THIS IS COLBERT.
NOW THIS THING, WHAT IS THIS
THING?
>> THAT'S THE MATERIAL GOING IN
THERE.
SO THIS IS THE PLASTIC.
IT GOES IN HERE, GETS HEATED UP,
MOVES AROUND AND BUILDS IT UP
LATER.
>> Stephen: IT'S LIKE A HOT
GLUE GUN EVENTUALLY.
>> IT'S LIKE WHAT A CALCULATOR
IS TO A COMPUTER WHAT A HOT GLUE
GUN IS TO A MAKER BOT.
>> Stephen: THE HOT GLUE GUN
STAYS IN ITS OWN SPOT AND THE
BOTTOM MOVES AROUND SO IT BUILDS
IT UP LAYER BY LAYER.
HOW ACCURATE CAN YOU BE WITH
THIS?
>> IT'S DOWN TO JUST MICRONS,
BUT YOU HAVE LAYER HEIGHT OF
ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF A MILLIMETER.
SO IT'S ON YOUR NOSE.
>> Stephen: IT'S LARGER THAN
ONE-THIRD OF A MILLIMETER, I'LL
HAVE YOU KNOW.
WHERE DO PEOPLE GET DESIGNS TO
MAKE IT WITH?
>> WE HAVE A SITE WHERE PEOPLE
MAKE AWESOME DESIGNS AND SHARE
THEM AND YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM
AND PRINT THEM OUT.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU PLUG IT
IN HERE?
>> AN SD CARD, LIKE THE WAY YOU
PLUG ENTER A CAMERA.
YOU PLUG IT IN.
>> Stephen: THEN IT MAKES THE
THING ON THAT CARD.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen: SO IF I HAVE
SOMETHING BROKEN AT MY HOME AND
SOMEONE ELSE HAS WHAT I NEED
10,000 MILES AWAY, THEY CAN SCAN
THE THING AND I CAN MAKE IT
HERE?
>> YEAH.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
HANDY, LIKE SAY YOU NEED NEW
SHOWER CURTAIN RING, ROW CAN
JUST PRINT OUT NEW SHOWER
CURTAIN RINGS AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE A BATH AT THAT POINT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: HOW WILL YOU MAKE
YOUR MONEY, JUST LIKE COPIERS,
YOUR GOING TO GET US ON THE
TONER, AREN'T YOU?
>> WE'LL RESIST THAT TEMPTATION.
>> Stephen: BRE PETTIS, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Stephen: BRE PETTIS, MAKER
BOT INDUSTRIES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
