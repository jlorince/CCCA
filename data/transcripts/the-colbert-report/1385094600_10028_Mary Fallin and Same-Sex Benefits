AND FOLKS I HAVE TO TELL YOUIT'S NOT JUST THE SENATE.
I AM SAD TO REPORT AMERICA ISLOSING THE BATTLE AGAINST GAY
MARRIAGE.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND 16STATES HAVE LEGALIZED MAN-ON
MANTWOIMONY INCLUDING JUST LASTWEEK HAWAII.
IT'S ALOA TRADITIONAL VALUES,AND ALOHA, GAY MARRIAGE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I WISH I COULD ASSAILANTOPPOSITE.
JUST LAST NIGHT, THE GOVERNMENTOF ILLINOIS SIGNED SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE LEGISLATION INTO LAW.
YOU KNOW WHO'S HAPPY ABOUT THAT?
THEEE BEARS!
WORST OF ALL, WOFERLT OF ALL,OUR MILITARY HAS FALLEN PREY TO
THE HOMOSEXUAL GAY AGENDA.
THREE YEARS AGO THEY DROPPEDDON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.
AT FIRST I FIGURED THE GAYSWOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE
MILITARY, THE THE CAMEO IS SOMATCHY-MATCHY.
TURNS OUT GAY PEOPLE HAVE SOMESORT OF SICK FETISH FOR SERVING
THEIR COUNTRY AND NOW THEY'RECASHING IN ON THOSE SWEET
BENEFITS.
JUST ASK SECRETARY OF DEFENSEAND MAN WHO WAS CRYING JUST
BEFORE YOU WALKED IN, CHUCKHAGEL.
>> WHEN THE SUPREME COURT ISSUEDITS DECISION ON THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT THIS SUMMER, THEDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN WORKING ONPROVIDING SAME BENEFITS, SAME
BENEFITS TO ALL ELIGIBLESPOUSES, REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL
ORIENTATION.
WE DID IT BECAUSE EVERYONE WHOSERVES OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM,
EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY, SHOULDRECEIVE ALL THE BENEFITS THEY
DESERVE AND THEY'VE EARNED.
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, THESEBENEFITS JUST ENCOURAGE THE
DESTRUCTIVE GAY HOOK-UP CULTURE.
MEETING YOUR SPOUSE IN SOMEWINDOWLESS BACK ROOM TO PROVIDE
HOT, SWEATY DENTAL COVERAGE.
THANKFULLY, ONE BRAVE STATE,OKLAHOMA, IS FIGHTING TO REMAIN
OKLA-HETERO.
ITS CONSTITUTION ALREADY BANSSAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
OTHERWISE, OKLAHOMA WOULD BE AGAY MECCA.
THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THEYHAVE TO OFFER THE GAYS-- THE
MUSICAL...
THAT'S IT.
( APPLAUSE )SO OKLAHOMA DID THE RIGHT THING
AND TOOK AWAY SOME RIGHTS.
JIM?
>> THE NATIONAL GUARD HASSTOPPED PROCESSING SAME-SEX
COUPLES BENEFITS AFTER GETTINGAN ORDER FROM GOVERNOR MARY
FALLON, DESPITE THE PENTAGON'SANNOUNCEMENT LAST MONTH THAT
SAME-SEX SPOUSES OF MILITARYMEMBERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE
SAME BENEFITS AS STRAIGHTCOUPLES.
>> Stephen:  SORRY, L.G.B.T.
CROWD, YOU GOT GREEDY.
IF YOU LET US KEEP DON'T ASK,DON'T TELL, NOBODY WOULD KNOW IF
YOUR SAME-SEX PARTNER WAS GAY.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, ACCORDING TO SOME OBSCURE
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, DENYINGRIGHTS TO A SPECIFIC MINORITY
GROUP IS ILLEGAL.
SO GOVERNOR FALLON IS ENSURINGTHAT ALL OKLA-HUMANS ARE TREATED
EQUALLY BY ORDERING STATE-OWNEDNATIONAL GUARD FACILITIES TO
STOP PROCESSING ALL MILITARYSPOUSE BENEFITS.
NOW, EVERY OKLAHOMA NATIONALGUARD MEMBER WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL
TO A FEDERALLY RUN FACILITY TOAPPLY FOR BENEFITS.
IN SOME CASES, THAT WOULD BE ANADDITIONAL FOUR-HOUR ROAD TRIP.
IT WILL BE FUN.
YOU CAN PLAY A GAME OF EYE SPYAND ARBITRARY DENIAL OF MY
RIGHTS.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, GOVERNOR FALLON IS SETTING
A GREAT PRECEDENT HERE.
RATHER THAN PROVIDE ANY SERVICESFOR GAY PEOPLE, THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD REFUSE TO PROVIDE THEMFOR EVERYONE.
BECAUSE ONCE A GAY PERSON GETSSOMETHING, IT GETS THEIR GAY ALL
OVER IT.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S WHY I THINK WE SHOULD
SHUT DOWN THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
IF I FIND OUT THAT FIREFIGHTERSALSO RESCUE GUY PEOPLE,
SUDDENLY, IT WILL SEEM GAY FORME TO HAVE THEIR CALENDAR.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S MARCH.
THAT'S MARCH.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
AND WHAT ABOUT SCHOOLS?
I'VE HEARD SOME OF THESENEW-FANGLED GAYS ALSO HAVE KIDS
THAT GO TO SCHOOL.
THEY'RE LEARNING THE SAME MATHAS MY KIDS, ALL SO THEY CAN GO
HOME AND COUNT THE NUMBER OFMOMMIES THEY HAVE.
( LAUGHTER )AND, FOLKS, WE WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF GAYSWEREN'T ALLOWED IN THE MILITARY.
SO NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED INTHE MILITARY.
I SAY LET THOSE DRONES DO ALLTHE WORK.
( LAUGHTER )THEY'RE STILL MOKS AWAY FROM
DEVELOPING A SEXUAL PREFERENCE.
BUT ONCE THEY DO, THEY'LL HAVENO PROBLEM CONNECTING WITH THEIR
SOUL MATES OR ANY OF THEIRCOLLATERAL SOUL MATES.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVEN THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH,FOLKS.
BECAUSE GOVERNOR FALLON, I HEARDTHAT GAY PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA
ENJOY THE CENT OF YOUR FLOWER,THE OKLAHOMA ROSE AS MUCH AS
STRAIGHT PEOPLE DO SHOW YOU CANSHHH ORDER EVERYONE IN YOUR
STATE TO CUT OFF THEIR NOSES TOSPITE THE GAYS BECAUSE YOU'RE
KIND OF DOING IT ALREADY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
