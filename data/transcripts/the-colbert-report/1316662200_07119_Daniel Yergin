>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT BELIEVES 50
YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL ALL BE
USING SOLAR POWER.
POLAR BEARS, HOW LONG CAN YOU
TREAD WATER?
PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL YERGIN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, MR. YERGIN.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU'RE ONE OF
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VOICES IN
THE WORLD OF ENERGY, AND YOUR
NEW BOOK IS "THE QUEST: ENERGY
SECURITY AND THE REMAKING OF THE
MODERN WORLD."
OKAY.
WILL WE REMAKE THE MODERN WORLD
WITH NEW FUELS OR NEW FORMS
BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF OIL
OUT THERE, ISN'T THERE?
>> WELL, THERE IS OIL.
WE'RE NOT RUNNING OUT OF OIL.
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PEAK OIL AND
SAY IT'S GOING TO RUN OUT, BUT
IN FACT WE'VE RUN OUT OF OIL AT
LEAST FIVE TIMES.
THE FIRST TIME IS THE 1880s.
NOW HERE WE ARE IN THE 21st
CENTURY.
>> Stephen: THERE'S PLENTY OF
OIL.
WHY WOULD WE CHANGE THE GAME?
IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT.
>> BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
THE REST OF THE WORLD, ONE TENDS
TO JUST THINK ABOUT THE UNITED
STATES.
>> I DO.
>> I KNOW YOU DO, BUT YOU HAVE
THE LOOK BEYOND OUR BORDERS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRY OF
CHINA, THAT'S WHERE DEMAND IS
REALLY GROWING INCH THIS COUNTRY
OUR DEMAND FOR OIL IS ACTUALLY
GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE
MORE EFFICIENT CARS AND THE
POPULATION IS AGING, A WHOLE
BUNCH OF REASONS.
>> Stephen: IF OUR DEMAND FOR
OIL IS GOING DOWN AND THERE IS A
LOT OF OIL IN THE WORLD, RIGHT,
THERE'S A LOT OF OIL OUT THERE.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF OIL.
>> Stephen: WHY IS IT SO
EXPENSIVE IN
>> BECAUSE THE COST OF
DEVELOPING IT HAVE GONE UP, AND
ALSO BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE
NEW DEMAND.
IN 2004, THE GENERAL VIEW WAS
OIL WOULD BE $20 A BARREL
FOREVER.
NOW WE SEE IT'S AROUND $100 A
BARREL.
>> Stephen: SO WE'LL NEVER GET
BACK TO $1 GASOLINE.
I USED TO LOVE THAT.
HOSE EACH OTHER DOWN.
>> IF YOU CORRECT IT FOR
INFLATION YOU'D FIND THAT $1
GASOLINE IS NOT A LOT CHAPPER
THAN GASOLINE PRICES TODAY, BUT
WE ARE AROUND $3.60.
BUT THERE... THE WORLD IS...
ENERGY DEMAND WILL GROW 30% OR
40%.
WE'RE GOING THE NEED OIL, BUT
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED ALL
THESE OTHER ENERGY SOURCES, SOME
OF WHICH ARE NEW.
IS IT GOING TO BE WIND?
>> WIND WAS KIND OF A FREAKY
THING IN THE 1980s.
TODAY IT'S KIND OF A
CONVENTIONAL PART OF THE
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY NOW.
>> BUT EVENTUALLY WE COULD RUN
OUT OF WIND, OR IT WOULD SLOW
THE PLANET DOWN.
>> WELL, WE HAVE...
>> PIN WHEELS ARE LIKE BRAKES.
THEY'RE LYING PUTTING YOUR HAND
OUT THE CAR WINDOW.
EVENTUALLY IT STOPS THE CAR.
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT
PEAK WIN, BUT THERE IS THAT
THREAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.
THE OTHER THING LONGER TERM IS
SOLAR POWER.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
SOLAR POWER, ISN'T THAT JUST
HIPPY DIPPY DREAMING?
SOLAR POWER?
JIMMY CARTER PUT IN SOLAR PANELS
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND REAGAN
HAD THEM RIPPED OUT IMMEDIATELY,
WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.
>> LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, IT'S A
VERY LONG LEAD TIME.
SOLAR POWER REALLY BEGAN WHEN
ALBERT EINSTEIN IN HIS SPARE
TIME IN 1905 WROTE A PAPER THAT
HE GOT A NOBEL PRIZE FOR ABOUT
DESCRIBING IT.
IT TOOK THE 1950s TO START
TURNING INTO A TECHNOLOGY AND
PUTTING I ON SATELLITE.
BY THE 1980s, PEOPLE GROWING
MARIJUANA WERE USING IT AS A WAY
TO DISCONNECT FROM THE ELECTRIC
POWER SYSTEM OSO NO ONE WOULD
KNOW THEY WERE USING
ELECTRICITY.
NOW IT'S ANOTHER GROWING
INDUSTRY.
STILL SMALL.
>> Stephen: SO YOU ADMIT SOLAR
POWER IS A DOPE DREAM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> IN THE 1980s IT WAS VERY
POPULAR FOR...
>> Stephen: BUT HOW ARE WE
GOING TO GET ALL THIS DONE?
WHO IS GOING TO DRILL FOR THAT?
>> FORTUNATELY THE SUN NORMALLY
RISES IN THE MORNING AND WE'LL
BE ABLE TO...
>> Stephen: FOR NOW.
WHAT ABOUT FRACKING?
I HEAR A LOT ABOUT FRACKING.
SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY UPSET ABOUT
SHOOTING HIGH-PRESSURE HOT WATER
AND CHEMICALS INTO THE GROUND
AND EXPLODING ROCKS.
>> WELL, THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN
USED SINCE 194, AND SOME OF THE
GASOLINE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN
YOUR CAR AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE
USING FRACKING.
IT'S NOW BEING USED... YOU KNOW,
SHALE GAS IS A BIG THING THAT'S
DEVELOPED.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE GET UPSET
BECAUSE IN THE AREAS WHERE THEY
DRILL, SOMETIMES THE WATER TURNS
FLAMMABLE.
BUT THESE DAYS MOSTLY WE BRUSH
OUR TEETH WITH MOUNTAIN DEW
ANYWAY, SO IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER.
>> LET'S GET THE WHOLE
PICTUREMENT I'M ON A COMMISSION
FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT WAS
SPECIFICALLY CHARGED TO LOOK AT
THESE ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONS
AROUND SHALE GAS.
AND WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE
MANAGED ABOUT WATER AND ABOUT
AIR.
IT HAS TO BE DONE IN AN
ENVIRONMENTALLY PROPER WAY.
ALSO IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY
IMPACT.
SO WITH THAT SAID, THESE ARE ALL
MANAGEABLE, AND THE OTHER SIDE
IS THAT WE WOULD BE... IT'S NOW
30% OF OUR NATURAL GAS IS FROM
SHALE GAS.
WE WOULD BE IMPORTING HUGE
AMOUNTS OF NATURAL GAS FROM
COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
NIGERIA AND ANGOLA AND TENS AND
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AN
WE'RE CREATING A LOT OF JOBS.
SO IF IT'S DONE IN THE RIGHT
WAY, IT'S A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE
FOR THIS COUNTRY AND MAKES US
STRONGER.
>> Stephen: SO MY TAKE AWAY
FROM THIS IS WE ARE NOT RUNNING
OUT OF OIL, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND BASED UPON
YOUR 800-PAGE BOOK, I GUESS
WE'RE NOT RUNNING OUT OF TREES
EITHER.
[APPLAUSE]
>> WAIT.
FIRST OF ALL... NO, NO, E-BOOK,
EMBOOK.
>> Stephen: SIR, WE HAVE
REACHED PEAK INTERVIEW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, DANIEL
YERGIN.
THE BOOK IS "THE QUEST."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
