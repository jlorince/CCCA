>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS MADE A
DOCUMENTARY ABOUT CHINESE
ARTIST AY WEIWEI.
>> THERE ARE PARTICULAR
MOMENTS AND PERIODS WHICH
ALLOW A VOICE TO CHANGE THE
WAY THAT PEOPLE THINK.
>> IN SOME CASES THEY CALL
HIM AY SHIN ON-LINE, FULLY
EYE, OR EYE GOD.
>> AYE SHIN WHICH IS LIKE
VENOUS OR SOMETHING, LIKE
THE GOD 6 LOVE.
>> IT'S A LOVE THING.
>> BASICALLY THEY CONSIDER
HIM A GOD.
>> IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS
DESCRIPTION IN CHINA.
>> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME
ALLISON CLAMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, ALLISON.
ALLISON, LET'S EDUCATE THE
PEOPLE HERE A LITTLE BIT AS
TO WHO IWAIWAY IS.
PUT UP THE FIRST SLIDE.
>> THAT IS PROBABLY THE WAY
HE MAYBE BEST KNOWN IN THE
WEST WHICH IS HELPING DESIGN
THE BIRDS NEST OLYMPIC
STADIUM CAN.
BECAUSE OF HIS OUTSPOKENNESS
HE DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM
THE OLYMPICS.
>> Stephen: IS THAT WHERE
THE TROUBLE STARTED FOR HIM.
>> THAT MAY BE WHERE THE
TROUBLE STARTED.
BUT IT GOT REALLY BIG WHEN
HE WROTE ABOUT THAT ON HIS
BLOG.
AND WHEN HE DID ACTIVISM
AROUND THE EARTHQUAKE IN MAY
2008 AND WANTED TO
COMMEMORATE THE CHILDREN WHO
DIED IN THAT EARTHQUAKE.
AND HE STARTEDDED CITIZENS
INVESTIGATION TO COLLECT
THOSE NAMES.
AND YOU KNOW, THAT
EVENTUALLY LED TO THEM
SHUTTING OFF HIS BLOG.
THAT LEAD TO THEM EVEN
BEATING HIM.
HE NEEDED EMERGENCY BRAIN
SURGERY.
>> Stephen: LET'S GO TO THE
NEXT SLIDE HERE, JIM.
>> THIS IS HIS STUDIO.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S A NEW STUDIO,
ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT
INVITED HIM TO BUILD IN
SHANGHAI.
RIGHT WHEN IT WAS FINISHED,
THEY WENT IN AND TORE IT
DOWN.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUT
HIM THAT EVEN WELCOMES THIS
KIND OF ATTENTION FROM THE
GOVERNMENT.
BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE KNOW
TO IGNORE ARTISTS IF THEY'RE
SERIOUS IN ANY WAY.
BECAUSE IN AMERICA SERIOUS
ARTISTS ARE A COMPLETE JOKE.
AND SO WHY OVER THERE DO
THEY TAKE HIM SO SERIOUSLY?
>> MAYBE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
TAKE HIMSELF SO SERIOUSLY.
HE KNOWS HOW TO REACH OUT TO
PEOPLE.
HOW TO CONNECT TO PEOPLE.
HE'S A REAL COMMUNICATOR AND
HE HAS A REALLY BIG
FOLLOWING ON-LINE.
AND I THINK IN CHINA,
ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW IN THIS
REALLY BIG CRACKDOWN, I MEAN
THEY ARE TRYING TO GO AT
ANYBODY WHO IS ABLE TO, YOU
KNOW, GATHER A GROUP AROUND
THEM OR BASICALLY FREE-- .
>> Stephen: WHY SUCH A
CRACKDOWN RIGHT NOW?
>> MAYBE HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE ARAB SPRING, YOU
KNOW, WORRIED ABOUT THE
REVOLUTION IN THEIR OWN
BACKYARD.
>> Stephen: BUT THEY DO NOT
HAVE ARABS IN CHINA.
>> THEY CERTAINLY HAVE, YOU
KNOW, ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE IN
CHINA THERE SAY REALLY BIG
DIVERSITY OF OPINION IN
CHINA.
THAT IS WHY I WANTED TO MAKE
A MOVIE ABOUT HIM IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
>> Stephen: IS HE KNOWN AS
SOMEBODY WHO OPPOSES THE
GOVERNMENT?
HAS HE BEEN SORT OF
REVOLUTIONARY AGAINST THE
REVOLUTION?
>> HE HAS DEFINITELY BEEN
KNOWN AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT
AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT TO GO THROUGH
THE SYSTEM, TO SHOW ITS
FLAWS.
AND TO JUST BE PROVOCATIVE
ON-LINE.
>> HOW HAS HE STAYED OUT OF
TROUBLE THIS LONG BECAUSE HE
HAS HAD SOME OTHER COUNTRY,
RIGHT?
AND HE SAID IT IN CHINESE
WHICH IS EVEN HARDER.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW HAS HE GOTTEN AWAY WITH
WHAT HE HAS DONE SO FAR?
>> WELL, THAT WAS THE BIG
QUESTION OVER THE TWO YEARS
THAT I SPENT WITH HIM,
RIGHT.
BUT HIS ANSWER TO THAT IS
ALWAYS WELL, WHAT EXACTLY
DID I GET AWAY WITH.
I MEAN LOOK, I HAVE BEEN
BEATEN.
MY BLOG HAS BEEN SUT DOWN.
>> Stephen: HE'S ALIVE I
SUPPOSE IS THE QUESTION CAN.
STILL ALIVE.
>> WELL, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'RE THAT RUTHLESS?
>> Stephen: DID YOU SEE THE
OPENING CEREMONY OF THE
OLYMPICS?
THOSE PEOPLE JUST WHAT THEY
DID TO THOSE DRUMS WAS-- U
SHOW THE NEXT PHOTO.
>> IN IS HIS ICONNOCLASTIC
NATURE.
WHAT IS HE HOLDING THERE.
>> HE'S HOLDING WHAT HE
CLAIMS DO BE AN UN.
VERY OLD, I THINK IT'S
PRETTY CLEAR THIS ISN'T
WORTH DETAINING SOMEONE FOR
44 DAYS WHICH IS WHAT HAS
HAPPENED SO FAR.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAN
AMERICANS DO TO PROTEST THIS
THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE
ANGERING CHINA OR REMINDING
THEM THAT WE OWE THEM A LOT
OF MONEY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S IN CHINA'S INTEREST
TO NOT BE DOING THIS.
IT DOESN'T-- IT'S NOT JUST
THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
FOR CHINESE.
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR
CHINESE SOCIETY TO CRUSH ALL
KINDS OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS.
HE'S REALLY NOT THAT
RADICAL.
HE'S NOT CALLING FOR AN
OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT.
HE'S JUST CALLING FOR PEOPLE
TO SPEAK OUT FOR PEOPLE TO
EXPRESS THEMSELVES, FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO BE MORE
TRANSPARENT.
>> Stephen: ALLISON CLAMAN,
A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER.
THE DOCUMENTARY IS NEVER
SORRY, LOOK FOR IT THIS
FALL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
