( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEVE HELLO.
WELCOME TO THE REPORT,
EVERYBODY.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Colbert: THANKS, AMERICA.
FOLKS, WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, AND IF YOU
ARE A REGULAR VIEWER OF THIS
SHOW -- AND I HOPE YOU ARE --
THEN YOU KNOW THAT I CALLS 'EM
LIKE I SEES 'EM, AND I SEES 'EM
WITH POORLY STRUCTURED
GRAMMARES.
THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF
THE FINGER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'VE
BEEN ENJOYING THE ARRIVAL OF
SPRING, THE LONGER DAYS, THE
CHIRPING BIRDS, THE BLOOMING
FLOWERS.
AND THE COMING PLAGUE.
>> SCIENTISTS ARE PREDICTING A
MASSIVE ONSLAUGHT OF CICADA BUGS
THIS YEAR SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S
KNOWN AS THE BROOD II CICADAS
>> THEY WILL INFEST THE EAST
COAST FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO NEW
YORK'S HUDSON VALLEY AND
CONNECTICUT
>> Colbert: THERE IS NOWHERE TO
HIDE, FOLKS.
WE'RE ABOUT TO FACE THE
BUG-POCALYPSE, SWARM-AGEDDON OR
AS I'M CALLING IT, BROOD II:
LECH TRICK BUG-ALOO.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF
MY FINGER TO BROOD II CICADAS
NOT FOR SWARMING, NO.
NOT FOR SWARMING, FOLKS.
BUT THIS.
>> FOR 17 YEARS OF BEING DORMANT
UNDERGROUND THE CREATURES ON THE
CICADAS ARE ABOUT TO MASS.
A MASSIVE GROUP NUMBERING IN THE
BILLIONS LAST SEEN IN THIS AREA
IN 1996.
>> Colbert: THANKS, CICADAS FOR
REMINDING ME THAT 1996 WAS 17
YEARS AGO.
WHAT THE HELL?
I MEAN,...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHERE DID THE TIME GO?
I GOT TO GET STARTED ON A
401(k).
HOW COULD 1996 BE THAT LONG AGO?
I MEAN, SEINFELD WAS ON AND I
REMEMBER IT.
JIMMY, CAN I SEE WHAT I LOOKED
LIKE IN 1996?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?
( APPLAUSE )
AM I MOLTING?
NEXT UP ON TIPPY CANOE AND THE
WAGGY TOO, FOLKS, I DON'T LIKE
TO BRAG BUT I'VE HAD SEX.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE KIND WITH WOMEN.
OF COURSE, I'M NOT ALONE.
THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY IS OBSESSED
WITH INTERCOURSE, A.K.A.,
COPULATION, FORNICATION, DOING
IT, MARY JANE, ANGEL DUST.
THE BIG APPLE.
WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE LATEST
SEX ENHANCER APHRODISIAC OR
UKRAINIAN EMAIL PROMISING TO
MAKE LADY SAY SEX BOOM BIG BIG
BIG BIG.
WELL, THE CANADIANS, OUR
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE ALWAYS ON TOP,
HAVE A NEW PRODUCT TO ENHANCE
INTERCOURSE.
JIM?
>> SEXCEREAL.
THAT IS IT'S NAME.
IT'S BEING BILLED AS THE WORLD'S
MOST PASSIONAL CEREAL.
IT FEATURES SPECIAL NATURAL
BLENDS FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN.
THE PROMOS ARE PLAYFUL SHOWING A
COUPLE AT FIRST BORED IN BED.
THEN THROW IN SOME SEX CEREAL
AND, OF COURSE, SOME SEX, WHICH
WE DON'T SEE.
AND THE MOOD PICKS UP.
>> Colbert: YES, THE MOOD PICKS
UP WHEN YOU THROW IN SOME
SEXCEREAL AND SOME SEX.
ITS MANUFACTURER CLAIMS IT'S
PART OF A BALANCED BREAKFAST.
YOU'LL NEED THAT BALANCE WHEN
YOU'RE DOING IT IN THE BREK
FOOFT NOOK.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
THE HAT TO SEX-CEREAL FOR MAKING
SURE WE'LL NEVER SKIP BREAKFAST
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BY WHICH AGAIN I MEAN SEX.
THE OLD 23 SKIDOO.
BECAUSE AT 6:30 A.M. WITH BLEARY
EYES AND BREATH LIKE A LANDFILL
CORPSE, WHO ISN'T CHAMPING AT
THE BIT TO GET BIZAY?
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS
>> THE CEREAL BOASTS ALL NATURAL
INGREDIENTS LIKE BEE POLLEN,
WHEAT GERMAN PUMPKIN SEEDS
SUPPOSEDLY ALL NATURAL
STIMULANTS FOR MEN AND WOMEN
>> Colbert: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
TELL ME ABOUT PUMPKIN SEEDS.
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW I CARVE A
JACK-O-LANTERN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NEXT, NATION, I'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S RAD
NEW EFFORT TO TOTALLY CONNECT
WITH US YOUNG-AMERICANS.
WELL, THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
>> THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE MADE THE
MOVE TO REDESIGN THEIR WEBSITE.
ENTER BUZZFEED.
AN ALL ENCOMPASSING SITE THAT
MIXES POLITICS, POP CULTURE AND
WEIRD NEWS FROM ALL OVER THE
WORLD.
>> THIS IS THE NEW SITE.
ESSENTIALLY IT'S THE N.R.C.C.'S
ATTEMPT TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT
MADE BUZZFEED WORK AND FEED IT
THROUGH A PARTISAN POLITICAL
PRISM
>> Colbert: YES THE N.R.C.C. IS
IS TAKING INSPIRATION FROM POLL
CULTURE LIST-MAKING SITE
BUZZFEED WHICH ITSELF TAKES
INSPIRATION FROM A.D.H.D.
OF COURSE, BUZZFEED HAS BECOME
FAMOUS FOR HIGHLY CLICKABLE NEWS
ITEMS LIKE 18 REASONS GLASS
DOORS ARE THE WORSE, 9 THINGS
SQUIRRELS ARE UP TO THESE DAYS,
AND THE 13 MOST IMPORTANT WATER
COLOR NARWHALS ON ETSY.
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF
MY HAT TO G.O.P. INTERNET MEME.
THEY'RE A GREAT WAY TO PROMOTE
CORE REPUBLICAN VALUES LIKE
SELF-RELIANCE BECAUSE WOULDN'T
THIS MEME BE SO MUCH MORE
INSPIRATIONAL IF THAT CAT CAN
HAZ EARND "CHEESE BURGER?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELL, FOLKS, I'VE BEEN
INTER-SURFING THE NEW
BUZZFEED-INSPIRED N.R.C.C. SITE,
AND THERE ARE TEN REASONS THIS
ADORABLE PUNDIT LOVES IT.
CHECK OUT THIS ACTUAL STORY.
13 ANIMALS THAT ARE REALLY
BUMMED ON OBAMA CARE'S THIRD
BIRTHDAY FEATURING THIS BABY
SEAL WITH THE LINE "OBAMA CARE
IS LEAVING JOB CREATORS OUT IN
THE COLD" OR "THIS PUPPY WITH
THE LINE" THIS PUPPY IS UPSET
THAT HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS
ARE ACTUALLY $3,000 HIGHER SINCE
OBAMA CARE PASSED."
I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH AN
EFFECTIVE MIX OF BALD POLITICAL
MESSAGING AND CUDDLY ANIMALS
SINCE GLOABLS' GERBILS AND THEIR
BENIGHTED SUB HUMAN RACE
POSTERS.
SO BRAVO, N.R.C.C., FOR TAKING
INSPIRATION FROM BUZZFEED.
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY
GOT SOME IDEAS FROM YOU TOO LIKE
THE 18 MOST EMBARRASSING
REPUBLICAN YOUTH OUTREACH FAILS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEER
