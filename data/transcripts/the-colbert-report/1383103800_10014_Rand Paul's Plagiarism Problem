>> Colbert: THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Colbert: THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, LIKE ALL AMERICANS,RIGHT NOW I AM OBSESSED WITH ONE
THING, THE VIRGINIAGUBERNATORIAL RACE BETWEEN
REPUBLICAN ANNE CUCCINELLI ANDDEMOCRAT TERRY MCAULIFFE, THIS
FOLKS IS THE BIGGEST BATTLE INVIRGINIA SINCE THE REVOLUTIONARY
WAR, WHICH OF COURSE IS STILLBEING FOUGHT IN WILLIAMSBURG.
WHEN WILL THE REDCOATSSURRENDER?  AND FOLKS I HAVE TO
TELL YOU I AM WORRIED ABOUT THECUCCI BECAUSE A RECENT POLL HAS
HIM TRAILING TERRY MCAULIFFE BYDOUBLE DIGITS, APPARENTLY
CUCCINELLI'S MESSAGE ABOUT LAWON ORAL SEX IS NOT GOING OVER
WELL WITH THE VIRGINIA VOTERS,MANY OF WHOM EVIDENTLY HAVE
GENITALS.
SO, WITH JUST ONE WEEK TO GOBEFORE ELECTION DAY, CUCCINELLI
HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITHKENTUCKY SENATOR RAND, RAND PAUL
WHO EXPRESSED HER PRO CHOICEVIEWS AND WHAT IT WOULD AFFECT
THE FUTURE.
>>>> THAT IS IRREFUTABLE, FOLKS,
WHAT HE IS SAYING, THAT ISIRREFUTABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
THAT MCAULIFFE PRO-CHOICEPOLICIES WILL LEAD TO AN ETHAN
HAWKE MOVIE.
>> DO WE WANT THAT?  WITH MSNBCTHE RAVEN CHEL MAD DOW FOUND
FAULT WITH RAND PAUL'S RESEARCHMETHODOLOGY.
>> THE WEIRD THING ABOUT THATLINE FROM SENATOR PAUL'S SPEECH
TODAY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANTFUTURE YOU JAN KNICKS IS COMMON
IS THAT LINE APPEARS ALMOSTVERBATIM IN THE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY
ON "GATTACA".
>> ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHEREEUGENICS IS COMMON AND DNA PLAYS
A CENTRAL ROLE IN DETERMININGYOUR ROLE IN SOCIETY.
>> OH, OH JUST BECAUSE HE ANDWIKIPEDIA USED THE SAME WORDS
RAND PAUL IS A PLAGIARIST?  YOUDON'T KNOW THAT.
MAYBE RAND PAUL WROTE THEWIKIPEDIA ENTRY ON "GATTACA".
I MEAN, TO BE SAFE, I DON'T KNOWWHAT ELSE THEY DO IN THE SENATE.
AND HOW DARE, HOW DARE RACHELMAD DOW YOU BESMIRCH THIS MAN'S
GOOD NAME.
RAND PAUL IS NOT A PLAGIARIST.
HE IS THE JUNIOR UNITED STATESSENATOR FOR KENTUCKY.
HE IS A MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICANPARTY, A GRADUATE OF THE DUKE
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,HE BEGAN PRACTICING
OPHTHALMOLOGY IN BOWLING GREEN,KENTUCKY.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Colbert: OPHTHALMOLOGY IS A
BRANCH OF MEDICINE THAT DEALSWITH THE ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND
DISEASES OF THE EYE.
THE INDIAN SURGEON SUSHRUTASAMHITA WROTE IN ABOUT 800 BC
ABOUT 76 OCULAR DISEASES AS WELLAS SEVERAL OPHTHALMOLOGICAL
SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS ANDTECHNIQUES.
SO SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT,RACHEL MAD DOW.
WHO IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUARE?  AND AMERICAN TELEVISION
HOST POLITICAL COMMENTARY ANDAUTHOR?
>> WE WILL BE RIGHT
