FOLKS, THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS
ARE NEXT WEEK, AND WE'RE FINALLY
GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO STOLE IT BY
BEING ELECTED.
OF COURSE, WHEN I SAY "TAKE IT
BACK," I REALLY MEAN BUY IT BACK
AT FULL RETAIL PRICE BECAUSE IT
TURNS OUT NOT ONLY IS FREEDOM
NOT FREE, IT AIN'T CHEAP.
JIM.
>> THIS YEAR IS ON RECORD TO
BREAK RECORDS FOR CAMPAIGN
SPENDING.
POLITICAL CANDIDATES ARE ON PACE
TO SPEND $3 BILLION BY NOVEMBER.
>> $3 BILLION.
APPARENTLY CARLY FIORINA IS
CAMPAIGNING IN A JETPACK.
FORTUNATELY, FORTUNATELY,
PUMPING CASH INTO POLITICS HAS
BEEN NO PROBLEM THIS YEAR THANKS
TO THE SUPREME COURT'S CITIZENS
UNITED RULING, WHICH ALLOWED
CORPORATIONS TO PROVIDE
UNLIMITED CASH FOR CAMPAIGN
ADVERTISING.
BUT IT TURNS OUT LETTING
CORPORATIONS BUY OUR ELECTIONS
COULD HAVE A DOWNSIDE.
AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
"WORD."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
INVISIBLE INC.
NOW, FOLKS, KIMBERLY STRASSEL OF
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
EXPLAINS THE DANGER THAT
DONATING TO CAMPAIGNS POSES FOR
CORPORATIONS.
>> THERE IS THIS ISSUE OF TARGET
COMPANIES WHICH GAVE SOME MONEY
TO A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY
CANDIDATE, WHO IS NOW RUNNING
FOR GOVERNOR IN MINNESOTA, TOM
EMMER.
MOVEON.ORG ONCE THEY KNEW ABOUT
THIS CONTRIBUTION, THEY TURNED
THIS INTO A QUESTION OF GAY
RIGHTS ISSUES BECAUSE MR. EMMER
IS CRITICAL OF GAY MARRIAGE AND
URGED A BOYCOTT OF TARGET
STORES.
>>
>> Stephen: IT IS SO UNFAIR.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT TARGETS THAT
MAKES PEOPLE SINGLE THEM OUT AND
AIM RIGHT AT THE CENTER OF THEIR
BUSINESS?
( APPLAUSE )
AND TARGET, TARGET IS NOT THE
ONLY COMPANY THAT COULD SUFFER
FOR ITS BELIEFS.
LUCKILY, LUCKILY THERE IS A WAY
TO KEEP PROTESTERS FROM
ORGANIZING AGAINST THESE
MULTINATIONAL CONGLOMERATES.
IT TURNS OUT, TURNS OUT
CORPORATIONS DON'T HAVE TO TELL
US WHO THEY'RE GIVING MONEY TO.
THEY CAN FUNNEL THEIR MONEY
THROUGH SHELL GROUPS TO CREATE
POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR
THEM.
I'LL LET THE COMPLAINER-IN-CHIEF
EXPLAIN.
>> AND THEY DON'T DISCLOSE WHO
IS BEHIND THE ADS.
COULD BE AN OIL COMPANY.
COULD BE AN INSURANCE COMPANY.
COULD BE WALL STREET.
YOU DON KNOW.
THEY'VE GOT THESE INNOCUOUS
SOUNDING NAMES LIKE "AMERICANS
FOR PROSPERITY," "THE COMMITTEE
FOR TRUTH IN POLITICS," OR "MOMS
FOR MOTHERHOOD."
( LAUGHTER )
I MADE THAT LAST ONE UP.
>> Stephen: SEE, HE ADMITS HE
MADE HIS MOTHER UP.
( LAUGHTER )
WHERE'S THAT BIRTH CERTIFICATE?
BUT EVEN, EVEN WITH THESE
ANONYMOUS POLITICAL
ORGANIZATIONS, THERE IS A RISK
VOTERS MIGHT FIND OUT WHO THE
BIG DONORS ARE.
SAY WHEN JOE CAMEL SHOWS UP ON
THE $50.
AND WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
KNOW THINGS, IT JUST LEADS TO
TROUBLE.
SO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE
OUR SYSTEM EVEN MORE ANONYMOUS.
I MEAN, NOT KNOWING, NOT KNOWING
WHICH CORPORATIONS BOUGHT
POLITICAL ADS IS A GOOD START.
SO WOULDN'T IT BE EVEN BETTER
NOT TO KNOW WHO ARE POLITICIANS
ARE?
LIKE MOST AMERICANS, I ALREADY
DON'T KNOW MY CONGRESSMAN'S
NAME?
AND WE WOULD NEVER, NEVER KNOW
THERE'S ANYTHING CORPORATE
INFLUENCE ON LEGISLATION IF WE
JUST NEVER KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE
LEGISLATION THAT CONGRESS VOTES
ON.
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT MAY NOT
BE ENOUGH IGNORANCE.
SO JUST TO PROTECT CORPORATIONS
A LITTLE MORE, I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD KNOW WHAT CORPORATIONS DO
OR MAKE OR WEAR OUR PRODUCTS
COME FROM.
I MEAN, FRANKLY, THE SOURCE OF
MY PAPER TOWELS SHOULD BE TOP
SECRET.
I AM HAPPY, I AM HAPPY TO
IMAGINE THAT THEY COME FROM A
BI-CURIOUS LUMBERJACK.
( APPLAUSE )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ONCE WE'RE
BUYING NAMELESS PRODUCTS FROM
ANONYMOUS CORPORATIONS WHO THEN
GIVE THAT UNTRACEABLE MONEY TO
FACELESS CONGRESSMEN TO PASS
UNKNOWABLE LAW, WE CAN TRULY
BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE
STANDS UP BEFORE THE COUNTRY AND
DECLARES:
>> THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS
STRONG.
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S "THE
WORD."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS
IMPORTANT MESSAGE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
