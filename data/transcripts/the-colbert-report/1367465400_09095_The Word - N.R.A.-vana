DORITOS FLAVOR EVER.
OBVIOUSLY, THOSE OF US WHO
OPPOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS COULD
ARGUE OUR CASE AGAIN.
BUT OUR CASE HAS ONE WEAKNESS.
>> THERE WERE NO COHERENT
ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY WE WOULDN'T
DO THIS.
>> Stephen: FINE.
THEN WHAT ABOUT INCOHERENT
ARGUMENTS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS
WILL LEAD TO A GUN REGISTRY AS
OF A LOT BY BIG FOOT AND THE
ILLUMINATE TO REPLACE THE POPE
WITH THAT DOG FROM THE BUSH'S
BAKED BEANS COMMERCIAL.
BUT LUCKILY THERE'S A WAY WE CAN
DEFEAT THE FORCES OF "DOING
SOMETHING."
AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S
WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
N.R.A.-VANA.
NATION, ON MY VERY FIRST
BROADCAST OF THIS SHOW I COINED
THE WORD TRUTHINESS TO DESCRIBE
THE NATURAL HUMAN DESIRE TO
IGNORE FACTS AND TO GO WITH WHAT
YOU FEEL IN YOUR GUT.
AND TRUTHINESS WORKS.
AFTER ALL, I WON A PULITZER FOR
IT.
NO, BUT IT FEELS LIKE I DID.
SADLY, WITH THE INCREASING
FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF MASS
SHOOTINGS, THE VICTIMS AND THEIR
FAMILIES ARE WINNING THE
EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT.
BUT SOME BRAVE AND HEARTLESS
INDIVIDUALS ARE WILLING TO FIGHT
BACK AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF
EMPATHY.
LIKE NATIONAL REVIEW COLUMNIST
KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON WHO SAID OF
GABBY GIFFORDS, QUOTE, IT SHOULD
BE NOTED THAT BEING SHOT IN THE
HEAD BY A LUNATIC DOES NOT GIVE
ONE ANY SPECIAL GRACE TO
PRONOUNCE UPON PUBLIC POLICY
QUESTIONS.
OH, IT IS NOTED.
EXPERIENCING MASSIVE HEAD TRAUMA
DOES NOT GIVE YOU SPECIAL
INSIGHT.
FOR INSTANCE, JUDGING BY HIS
COLUMN, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH KEVIN WILLIAMSON'S HEAD.
NOW, ANOTHER HERO IN THIS FIGHT
IS SENATOR RAND PAUL WHO SAID
THIS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE
NEWTOWN FAMILIES.
>> I HATE TO SEE HIM USING
PEOPLE.
I THINK AS PROPS AND
POLITICIZING PEOPLE'S TRAGEDY.
I MEAN, WHEN I SEE THE FATHER
AND THE MOTHERS ANTHEM
TESTIFYING, IT STILL SADDENS ME
JUST TO SEE THEM.
>> Stephen: HEY, NEWTOWN
PARENTS, STOP MAKING RAND PAUL
SAD.
HE'S EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO HIS
OWN FEELINGS.
I MEAN, WHAT I THINK RAND PAUL
REMINDS US US HERE IS THAT
GRIEVING FAMILIES AREN'T THE
REAL VICTIMS.
GUN OWNERS ARE.
A POINT DRIVEN HOME BY
CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST BOB
DAVIS.
>> I'M SORRY THAT YOU SUFFERED A
TRAGEDY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
DEAL WITH IT AND DON'T FORCE ME
TO LOSE MY LIBERTY WHICH IS A
GREATER TRAGEDY THAN YOUR LOSS.
>> Stephen: YES, THE PARENTS OF
NEWTOWN ONLY LOST THEIR CHILDREN
BUT BOB DAVIS MIGHT HAVE TO FILL
OUT SOME FORMS AT A GUN SHOW.
THAT'S A PRECIOUS WASTE OF
TIME -- TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT
YELLING AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST
THEIR CHILDREN.
AND FOLKS, DAVIS, ALREADY KNOWS
WHAT HE'D YELL.
>> I'M SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING
THESE VICTIMS TROTTED OUT, GIVEN
RIDES ON AIR FORCE ONE, HAULED
INTO THE SENATE WELL AND
EVERYONE IS JUST... THEY'RE
TERRIFIED OF THESE VICTIMS.
I WOULD STAND IN FRONT OF THEM
AND TELL THEM GO TO HELL.
>> THEY'RE BEING USED.
Stephen: FINALLY SOMEONE WITH
THE COURAGE TO TELL OFF THESE
NEWTOWN PARENTS TO THEIR FACES.
AND FOLKS HE WOULD DO IT.
IN FACT WHEN ONE SANDY HOOK
RESIDENT OFFERED TO PAY TO FLY
HIM OUT TO CONNECTICUT DAVIS
PROVED HE NOT ONLY TALKS THE
TALK, HE WALKS THE... HASN'T
RESPONDED.
WELL, HE'S PROBABLY BUSY
ANSWERING FAN MAIL.
NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT BE
SAYING, STEPHEN, WON'T
DEMONIZING THE VICTIMS OF GUN
VIOLENCE MAKE PEOPLE HATE US?
NO, GREG.
IT WON'T BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS.
>> SENATOR, YOU VOTED NO ON THAT
BACKGROUND CHECK.
ACCORDING TO A NEW P.P.P. POLL,
NEVADA SENATOR DEAN HELLER LOST
TWO POINTS OVER ALL.
SENATOR MARK BEGICH OF ALASKA
DOWN SIX POINTS.
HIS COLLEAGUE IN ALASKA
MURKOWSKI LOST 16 POINTS.
SENATOR ROB PORTMAN OHIO OF LOST
A NET OF 18 POINTS.
NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN KELLY
AYOTTE HAS SLID 15 POINTS.
>> Stephen: POOR KELLY AYOTTE.
APPARENTLY NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS
DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THEIR STATE
MOTTO TO LIVE FREE AND DIE.
BUT, FOLKS, TO WIN THE FIGHT
AGAINST THESE ENORMOUSLY POPULAR
MODEST GUN REGULATIONS, WE CAN'T
CARE ABOUT THE VOTERS.
WE CAN'T CARE ABOUT COHERENT
ARGUMENT.
WE CAN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT WHAT
FEELS RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND ALL
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF POLITICAL
ENGAGEMENT AND HUMAN INTERACTION
AND ACHIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE THE
ZEN BUDDHISTS CALL SATORI,
WHEREIN WE ARE BUT EMPTY VESSELS
WAITING TO BE FILLED.
THESE SENATORS MUST REACH A
STATE BEYOND TRUTHINESS, A
COMPLETE NONATTACHMENT TO
ANYTHING OTHER THAN KEEPING
THEIR JOBS.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
