>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH.
FOLKS, I HOPE YOU KNOW THATTHERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO
BIGGER SUPPORTER OF THEPOLICE THAN YOURS TRULY.
THEY SHOULD HAVE EVERY TOOLAT THEIR DISPOSAL TO KEEP US
SAFE.
BUT NOW A BUNCH OF WEAKKNEED LAWMAKERS ARE TRYING
TO TAKE AWAY A CRITICALCRIME FIGHTING TOOL.
>> A HAWAII LAW ALLOWINGPOLICE OFFICERS TO HAVE SEX
WITH PROSTITUTES COULD BE ONITS LAST LEGS.
>> CURRENTLY ON DUTY OFFICERSARE EXEMPT FROM HAWAII'S
PROSTITUTION LAWS.
>> TODAY STATE SENATORS HELDA HEARING AND VOTED TO
REMOVE A POLICE EXEMPTION INTHE LAW.
>> Stephen: DID YOU JUSTHEAR THAT?
LAWMAKERS WANT TO TAKE AWAYHAWAII'S COPS RIGHT TO HAVE
SEX WITH PROSTITUTES.
ALSO, DID I JUST HEAR THATHAWAII'S COPS HAVE THE RIGHT
TO HAVE SEX WITH PROSTITUTES?
(APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS, WELL,
THEY SHOULD.
IT'S JUST LIKE NEW YORK'SSTOP AND FRISK POLICY,
EXCEPT ONCE THEY START FRISKING,THEY DON'T STOP.
FOLKS, THIS IS AN ESSENTIALTOOL.
AS THE HONOLULU POLICE SAY,THE ABILITY TO HAVE SEX WITH
PROSTITUTES IS AN IMPORTANTPART OF FIGHTING CRIME.
YES, BECAUSE SOON AS THECRIME IS COMMITTED, THE
POLICE ARE ALREADY ON THESCENE.
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T
LET COPS MURDER PEOPLE TOO.
BUT THIS NEW RESTRICTIONWOULD LEAVE OUR BOYS IN BLUE
WITH BLUE BOYS.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE IT ALLOWS POLICE
OFFICERS ONLY TO TOUCH ADULTPROSTITUTES BUT NOT SEXUALLY
PENETRATE.
THESE LAWMAKERS ARE PLAYINGWITH FIRE.
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKINGABOUT THE CHLAMYDIA TEARING
THROUGH THE HONOLULU PD.
BECAUSE AS THE POLICE WARNED,WITHOUT THIS VITAL LEGAL
PROTECTION, PROSTITUTESWOULD ENGAGE IN COP CHECKING,
WHERE THEY WOULD DEMAND TOHAVE SEX BEFORE RECEIVING
MONEY IN ORDER TO FILTER OUTCOPS.
YUP?
HOOKERS DO IT ALL THE TIME.
THEY HAVE SEX WITH YOU, THENREFUSE ANY MONEY TO MAKE
SURE YOU'RE NOT A COP.
(LAUGHTER)A CLASSIC SCAM.
THE POINT IS, THE SEX ISESSENTIAL.
AND IN ONE CASE, IT WASESSENTIAL WITH THREE
DIFFERENT OFFICERS IN ONEEVENING BEFORE THE
PROSTITUTE WAS ARRESTED.
SO OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST COPHAD TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS A
PROSTITUTE.
THE SECOND COP HAD TO MAKESURE THE FIRST COP WASN'T
CROOKED.
AND THE THIRD COP WAS A RIDEALONG.
(LAUGHTER)HERE NOW WITH AN INSIDER
PERSPECTIVE ON WHY POLICECANNOT DO THEIR WORK UNLESS
THEY HAVE SEX WITHPROSTITUTES, IS UNDERCOVER
HONOLULU POLICE OFFICER RANDYFARRAR, THANK YOU, GOOD TO
SEE YOU.
NOW MR. FARRAR, THANK YOUFOR JOINING US.
>> ALOHA, MY MAN.
>> Stephen: NOW RANDY, AREYOU WITH THE HONOLULU PD.
>> I WOULD RATHER NOT SAY.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T WANTTO BLOW YOUR COVER.
>> YES, ALSO I'M NOT ON THEFORCE.
BUT I AM A MEMBER OF THENEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.
>> Stephen: IS THAT YOURJOB.
>> WELL, I'M NOT PAID PER SE.
FOR CASH I DRIVE A FOOD TRUCK DOWNTOWN,
SOMETIMES THE WORKING GIRLSLIKE TO HAVE A SANDWICH, IF
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: YOU MEAN LIKE A
COUPLE PIECES OF BREAD,MAYBE SOME MEAT OR LETTUCE.
>> OH, SO YOU'RE HIP TO THESCENE.
>> Stephen: I JUST WANT TOUNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE NOT A COP.
>> SAYS WHO?
>> Stephen: SAYS YOU JUSTNOW.
>> THEN WHY DO I HAVE THISBADGE
(LAUGHTER)>> Stephen: RANDY, THAT IS A
HALF A GRILLED CHEESESANDWICH.
>> TOUCHE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, RANDY,RANDY, HOLD ON, EXPLAIN TO
US-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
EXPLAIN TO US WHY THEHONOLULU PD NEEDS THIS KIND
OF FLEXIBILITY.
>> FLEXIBILITY IS WHAT IT'SALL ABOUT.
AS WE SAY DOWN AT THE 5-0YOU HAVE TO TOUCH YOUR TOES
BEFORE YOU TOUCH THE HOES.
>> Stephen: I MEAN I'M SURETHAT'S GOOD ADVICE BUT I
MEAN THE LAW.
HAS A PROSTITUTE EVER COP-CHECKED YOU.
>> -- THAT IS WHY NO MONEYCHANGES HANDS UNTIL RANDY
GETS THE HANDY.
AND BY THE WAY, CAN I JUSTSAY YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FINE
LOOKING LADIES HERE TONIGHT.
I WOULD NOT MIND TAKING THEMTO MY LUOA.
>> Stephen: RANNY, PLEASEDON'T TALK TO THE AUDIENCE.
>> SORRY, JUST DOING MY JOB.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS YOUROTHER JOB.
>> PROSTITUTE.
>> Stephen: YOU TAKE MONEYFOR SEX.
>> THEY DON'T PAY ME FOR SEX,STEPHEN, THEY MAY ME TO
LEAVE, SOMETIMES HALFWAYTHROUGH, I'M THAT GOOD.
>> Stephen: RANLDY FARRAR,EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
