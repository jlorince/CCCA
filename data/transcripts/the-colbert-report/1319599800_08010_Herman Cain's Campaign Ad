VERSION.
I HEAR IT'S GOING TO HAVE A
REVOLUTIONARY SOFT COVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, THIS POLITICAL SEASON,
LIKE MANY AMERICANS I'VE BEEN
SWEPT UP BY A CATEGORY 5
HURRMANCAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S THE WASHINGTON OUTSIDER
WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO SAY THE
THINGS THE NATION NEEDS TO HEAR
AND THEN CAN'T BELIEVE IT JUST
HEARD.
THINGS LIKE "LET'S ELECTROCUTE
MEXICANS" OR "I'M LEADING IN THE
POLLS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THE LATEST CBS/NEW YORK
TIMES/TACO BELL POLL HAS CAIN AT
25% BEATING MITT ROMNEY AT 21%.
WHY?
WELL, A LOT OF THEORIES OUT
THERE.
SOME SAY IT'S CAIN'S BUSINESS
EXPERIENCE, SOME SAY IT'S HIS
SIMPLIFIED TAX PLAN, SOME SAY
IT'S JUST THAT HE'S NOT MITT
ROMNEY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OTHERS POINT TO THE FACT THAT
MITT ROMNEY IS MITT ROMNEY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHATEVER THE REASON, CAIN'S A
REBEL WHOSE CAMPAIGN HAS
CAPTURED AMERICA'S HEART, AND
NOW HE'S RELEASED ANOTHER AD
THAT DOES NOT PLAY BY THE RULES.
>> MARK BLOCK HERE, SINCE
JANUARY I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF BEING CHIEF OF STAFF TO
HERMAN CAIN.
WE'VE RUN A CAMPAIGN LIKE NO
BODY'S EVER SEEN.
BUT THEN AGAIN, AMERICA'S NEVER
SEEN A CANDIDATE LIKE HERMAN
CAIN.
WE NEED YOU TO GET INVOLVED.
BECAUSE TOGETHER WE CAN DO THIS,
WE CAN TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK.

>> Stephen: WOW, SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT GUY JUST SEEMS COOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[COUGHING] I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER
ON IT THOUGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, THE BED WETTERS IN
THE NERD PATROL DON'T GET IT.
>> IT MEANS DISASTER.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE
CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS IN A
COMMERCIAL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
CIGARETTE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MUSIC.
I DON'T THE UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC
BEHIND THIS.
THIS MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.
YOU TALK ABOUT SHOOTING YOURSELF
IN THE FOOT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S STUPID, HE'S
NOT SHOOTING HIMSELF IN THE
FOOT.
HE'S SHOOTING HIMSELF IN THE
LUNGS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS SENDING THE STRONG
MESSAGE THAT HERMAN CAIN DOESN'T
JUST WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, HE WANTS TO BE
THE PRESIDENT OF FLAVOR COUNTRY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FOX NEWS HOST AND ALFRED
HITCHCOCK LOVE INTEREST MEGYN
KELLY PROVED SHE GETS IT WHEN
SHE TALKED TO THE GUY IN THE AD.
>> WERE YOU TRYING TO APPEAL TO
FOLKS WHO ARE OUT THERE LIVING
REAL LIVES-- WORKING THE FARM,
WORKING IN DETROIT, THAT KIND OF
THING-- AS OPPOSED TO THE EAST
AND WEST COAST ELITE, PEOPLE IN
MEDIA CIRCLES WHO SHUN SMOKING
AND SORT OF REAL AMERICAN
THINGS?
>> Stephen: YES, THERE'S NOTHING
MORE REAL AMERICAN THAN SMOKING
CIGARETTES, THE CARCINOGEN OF
REAL AMERICANS LIKE JOHN WAYNE,
HUMPHREY BOGART, AND THE
MARLBORO MAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT CAN'T BE GO.
-- THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
LOCK THE DOORS.
TRAGEDY TODAY AT THE COLBERT
REPORT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I WAS SO INSPIRED BY THE
WAY HERMAN CAIN'S AD STICKS IT
TO THE EAST AND WEST COAST
ELITES THAT I'VE MADE SOME CAIN
ADS OF MINE OWN -- YES, MINE
OWN --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK --
[ LAUGHTER ]

PARALYZED MY TONGUE.
I WAS SO IMPRESSED THAT I MADE
ADS OF MY OWN.

POWERFUL STUFF.
BUT FOLKS, THE BEST PART OF
CAIN'S AD MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THE
UNEXPECTED SMOKING.
NO, THE BEST PART IS THE 8
SECONDS IT TAKES FOR HERMAN CAIN
TO SMILE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH.
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S
SMILING.
I MEAN LISTEN TO THAT SONG HE'S
ROCKING TO.
JIMMY, GIVE US ANOTHER TASTE.
[SINGING "I AM AMERICA"]
HA, I AM AMERICA.
WHERE I HAVE HEARD THAT BEFORE?
ON THE COVER OF MY #1
BEST-SELLING BOOK: " I AM
AMERICA AND SO CAN YOU."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, HERMIE, I'M FLATTERED,
BECAUSE CLEARLY CAIN IS BASING A
LOT OF HIS CAMPAIGN ON MY BOOK.
IN THAT HIS CAMPAIGN IS MOSTLY
ABOUT SELLING HIS BOOK.
BUT HERMAN, I KNOW IT SAYS "AND
SO CAN YOU" BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
SAY YOU'RE AMERICA AND SO CAN
YOU, TOO.

YOU HAVE TO COME ON MY SHOW.
YOU HAVE CANCELLED ON ME TWICE,
