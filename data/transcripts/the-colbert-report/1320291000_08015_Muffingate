>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
OARVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NATION, EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES
THE SHOW KNOWS I AM A LONGTIME
CRITIC OF GOVERNMENT WASTE.
WHAT WAS JEFFERSON THINKING
PAYING $15 MILLION FOR
LOUISIANA?
( LAUGHTER )
HE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT THE WAY
EVERYTHING ELSE IS PAID FOR DOWN
THERE-- BY SHOWING NAPOLEON HIS
TITS.
200 YEARS LATER, NOTHING HAS
CHANGED, FOLKS.
JUST REPLACE $15 MILLION WITH
$16 AND LOUISIANA WITH BREAKFAST
PASTRIES.
>> MUFFIN-GATE.
PAY TRAINING CONFERENCE IN
AUGUST '09, $4200 WAS SPENT ON
250 MUFFINS.
THAT ADDS UP TO 16 BUCKS PER IF
N.UMORI
WHY SHOULD I OR YOU WORK HARD
EVERY DAY SO SOME GUY IN A SUIT
CAN HAVE A $16 MUFFIN.
>> MAYBE I'M A CHEAP SCABBING
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PAY 16
BUCKS FOR A MUFFIN.
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT IT
IT IT IT IT.
>> Stephen:  WHY WOULD THE
GOVERNMENT SPEND $16 ON A MUFFIN
WHEN THEY CAN GO TO STARBUCKS
AND GET ONE FOR 14.
OF COURSE, FOLKS, I'VE BEEN
TRACKING MUFFIN-GATE VERY
CLOSELY, AS WELL AS
MUFFIN-TOP-GATE.
WHEN DID I GAIN ALL THIS WEIGHT?
WELL, NOW THERE'S BEEN A
SURPRISING NEW DEVELOPMENT IN
THIS STORY OF OUT-OF-CONTROL
BAKERY GREED.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
INSPECTOR GENERAL ADMITS IT MADE
A MISTAKE WHETHER IT SAYS THE
AGENCY SPENT MORE THAN $16 ON
EACH MUFFIN AT A LEGAL
CONFERENCE.
>> YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REPORT
REFERS TO THE ACTUAL EVENT THAT
THERE WERE SOME OTHER THINGS
PURCHASED.
THERE WAS TEA AND COFFEE AND
SOME OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS
THE COST OF THE MEETING SPACE AT
THE CAPITOL HILTON SO IT'S
MISLEADING TO SAY THE MUFFIN
COVER THE $16.
IT WAS INVOICED THAT WAY BUT THE
MUFFIN ITSELF DIDN'T COST THAT
MUCH.
>> Stephen:  WELL, WELL, THAT
CHANGES THINGS.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR
GENERAL, WHICH MADE THE ORIGINAL
$16 MUFFIN CLAIM, DID A THOROUGH
FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION, AND THE
RESPONSIBLE USE OF YOUR TAX
DLARPS IS MADE CLEAR IN THE UDIT
OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
CONFERENCE PLANNING AND FOOD AND
BEVERAGE COST REPORT.
IT'S 151 PAGES PROVING THERE WAS
NO GOVERNMENT MONEY WASTED ON
MUFFINS.
( LAUGHTER )
AND IT IS THOROUGH, FOLKS.
IT HAS FULL-COLORED MUFFIN
TABLES.
LOOK AT THAT.
APPENDISS, 55 FOOTNOTES, AS WELL
AS ANALYSIS OF THE COST OF BEEF
WELLINGTON HORS D'OEUVRES, THE
CLARIFICATION THAT A CUP IS
EQUAL TO EIGHT OUNCES, AND THAT
LIGHT REFRESHMENTS ARE DEFINED
AS COFFEE, TEA, MILK, JUICE,
SOFT DRINKS, DONUTS, BAGELS,
FRUIT, PRETZELS, COOKIES, CHIPS,
OR MUFFINS.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND I BELIEVE LITTLE-- I BELIEVE
THE AGENCY SEAL, I BELIEVE THAT
IS SCRATCH AND SNIFF.
( LAUGHTER ).
BANANA NUT.
( LAUGHTER )
AND FOR ALL MY FELLOW PUNDITS
OUT THERE, EAGER TO SNIFF OUT
FURTHER GOVERNMENT WASTE,
HOPEFULLY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
WILL BE ISSUING A 300-PAGE
REPORT INVESTIGATING RUMORS THIS
150-PAGE REPORT ON $16 MUFFINS
