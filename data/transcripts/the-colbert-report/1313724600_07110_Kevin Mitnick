>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS ONCE
THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED
HACKER.
HE'LL NEVER GET MY PASSWORD
IT'S--
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE WELCOME KEVIN MITNICK.
(APPLAUSE)
>> THANKS FOR COMING ON.
GREAT TO MEET YOU.
>> GREAT TO MEET YOU TOO.
>> YOU SIR WERE ONCE
CONSIDERED THE WORLD'S MOST
FAMOUS HACKER.
THE MOST WANTED MAN IN
COMPUTER CRIME.
CORRECT?
>> YES.
>> OKAY.
YOU ARE A CONSULTANT NOW BUT
AT ONE TIME YOU WERE, LET'S
SEE, YOU BYPASSED THE
SECURITY SYSTEMS OF MOTOROLA,
SUN MICROSYSTEMS AND PACIFIC
BELL.
>> YES, I DID.
>> YOU SERVED JAIL TIME FOR
THIS.
HOW MUCH.
>> FIVE YEARS.
>> FIVE YEARS.
>> AND A YEAR IN SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT.
>> WHY A YEAR IN SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A
DANGEROUS GUY.
>> I'M VERY DANGEROUS.
>> THE PROSECUTOR HAS TOLD A
JUDGE DURING A BAIL HEARING
THAT I COULD PICK UP THE
TELEPHONE AND CONNECT TO
NORAAD AND WHISTLE THE
LAUNCH CODES AND LAUNCH A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
AND BECAUSE OF THIS, THE
JUDGE ACTUALLY HAD TO
SPECIAL ORDER THAT I WOULD
HAVE TO BE HELD IN PRISON
WITHOUT ACCESS TO A
TELEPHONE.
SO THE ONLY PLACE THEY COULD
PUT ME WAS IN SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT.
SO I WAS THERE ABOUT A YEAR.
>> Stephen: AND COULD YOU DO
THAT, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE
BAD ASS.
>> I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE GOT A
BOOK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.
IT'S CALLED GHOST IN THE
WIRES.
MY ADVENTURE'S AS THE
WORLD'S MOST WANTED HACKER.
HOW OLD YOU WERE WHEN YOU
STARTED HACKING.
>> I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
>> Stephen: DID YOU GET INTO
HACKING FOR THE GIRLS.
>> NO.
I SHOULD HAVE.
WHY DID YOU START.
>> I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE
TELEPHONE SYSTEM.
I STARTED IN A HOBBY CALLED
PHONE FREAKING AND I LOVED
DOING MAGIC TRICKS AND
PULLING PRANKS.
I WAS A PRANKSTER BY HEART.
AND AS THE PHONE COMPANY
BECAME MORE COMPUTERIZED, I
WANTED TO GET ACCESS TO
PHONE COMPANY SYSTEMS TO
PULL BANKS.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONES WAS
TO CHANGE THE CLASS OF
SERVICE OF A FRIEND'S PHONE
TO A PAY PHONE SO WHENEVER
HE OR HIS PARENTS TRIED TO
MAKE A CALL IT WOULD SAY
PLEASE DEPOSIT 25 CENTS.
(APPLAUSE)
SO WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY DO
THAT GOT YOU ARRESTED?
>> WELL, I HACKED INTO A LOT
OF SYSTEMS.
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT IT YOU
SEEM HESITANT TO REVEAL THE
CONTENTS OF YOUR BOOK.
>> NO, IT'S ALL THERE.
BUT I HACKED INTO A LOT OF
SYSTEMS.
AND I ACTUALLY WAS A
FUGITIVE FROM THE GOVERNMENT
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
>> Stephen: FOR THREE YEARS.
>> FOR THREE YEARS AND
PLAYING THIS CAT AND POST
GAME WITH THE FBI BECAUSE I
MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT
CRAZY.
>> Stephen: WERE YOU
ACTUALLY TAUNTING THEM.
>> NOT TAUNTING THEM BUT I
WAS WATCHING THEM THROUGH
THE CELLULAR PHONE SYSTEM AS
I WAS ABLE TO WORK OUT THEIR
TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND I
HACKED INTO THE CELL PHONE
SYSTEM SO I COULD KEEP TRACK
OF WHERE THEY WERE.
SO IF THEY GOT CLOSE TO ME,
I WOULD GO FARTHER AWAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD
PLAN.
>> IT'S A REALLY GOOD PLAN.
HOW DID YOU FINALLY GET
CAUGHT.
>> THEY ACTUALLY WENT OUT
WITH RADIO DIRECTION FINDING
GEAR AND TRACKED MY CELLULAR
PHONE SIGNALS TO AN
APARTMENT IN RALEIGH, NORTH
CAROLINA ON VALENTINE'S DAY
1995.
SO I DEFINITELY WASN'T
HACKING FOR THE GIRLS.
I WAS ALONE AND BEHIND MY
COMPUTER.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU
THINK, IF YOU DID WHAT YOU
DID TODAY, I'M SURE YOU
WOULDN'T BE PUT IN SOLITARY.
>> CUAN TAN MO BAY.
>> Stephen: YOU THINK?
>> PROBABLY.
NOW IN THIS POST 9/11 WORLD
I THINK HACKING IS ALMOST
CONSIDERED A FORM OF
TERRORISM.
>> Stephen: BUT COULDN'T WE
USE YOU, AREN'T
YOU-- BECAUSE THE CHINESE
HACK OUR SYSTEMS, RIGHT.
>> ALL THE TIME.
>> Stephen: SHOULDN'T WE
UNLEASH YOU ON OUR ENEMIES.
>> I THINK THAT IS A GREAT
IDEA.
COY BE THE SECRET WEAPON OF
THE UNITED STATES UNTIL
AFTER ALL THOSE HACKERS THAT
ARE BREAKING INTO RSA
AND-- .
>> Stephen: IF PU WERE OUR
SECRET WEAPON SOME OTHER
HACK CORE CALL YOU UP AND
WHISTLE INTO HIS PHONE AND
ACTIVATE YOU.
>> WELL, I WILL TURN OFF MY
CELL PHONE.
>> Stephen: DOW MISS THE
GAME.
>> I ACTUALLY HACK ALL THE
TIME.
I.
>> Stephen: SHH.
>> HOW DO YOU HACK?
>> YOU KNOW, JUST THE OTHER
DAY I HACKED INTO A
COMPANY'S SYSTEM AND GOT
ACCESS TO EVERYTHING.
BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS
THEY ACTUALLY GAVE ME
PERMISSION AHEAD OF TIME.
THEY ACTUALLY GAVE ME A GET
OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD SO I
COULD HACK INTO THEIR SYSTEM
TO FIND ALL THEIR
VULNERABILITIES SO THEY
COULD FIX THEM BEFORE THE
REAL BAD GUYS GET IN.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A HOLY
GRAIL OF HACKING LIKE
SOMETHING THAT THE GREATEST
HACKER WOULD WANT TO TRY TO
GET INTO BUT NO ONE HAS EVER
BEEN ABLE TO DO.
>> I THINK BACK IN MY DAY
WAS HACKING INTO THE
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY.
AND WHEN I WAS A JUVENILE,
WHEN I WAS 16, 16.5 I
ACTUALLY WAS ABLE TO GET
INTO A TELEPHONE SWITCH IN
MARYLAND AND I WAS ABLE TO
INTERCEPT AN ONGOING
CONVERSATION FROM THE NSA'S
FACILITY IN FORT MEAD.
I JUST POPPED ON THE
CONVERSATION, I HEARD A MAN
AND WOMAN TALKING.
AND I GO OOH THIS IS COOL,
COY REALLY DO T AND
DISCONNECTED AND NEVER DID
IT AGAIN.
JUST THE TO CLIMB MOUNT
EVEREST.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY
CHANCE THAT YOU'RE JUST
TELLING ME THAT SO YOU DON'T
DO HARDER JAIL TIME?
>> POSSIBLY
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BOOK IS WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
