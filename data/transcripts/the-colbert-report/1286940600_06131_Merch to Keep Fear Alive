>> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BAN,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
NATION, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW,
THERE ARE JUST TWO AND A HALF
WEEKS AWAY FROM MY MARCH TO KEEP
FEAR ALIVE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WOULD SAY... THAT REACTION
RIGHT THERE, THAT REACTION IS
TERRIFYING.
AS ALWAYS, MY MARCH COVERAGE IS
SPONSORED BY REESE'S, LEADING
HIDEOUS ALIEN CREATURES TO OUR
CHILDREN SINCE 1982.
WELL, TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO
ANNOUNCE THAT OFFICIAL MARCH
MERCHANDISE IS NOW AVAILABLE AT
KEEPFEARALIVE.COM.
IT'S THE MARCH TO KEEP FEAR
ALIVE.
ALL PROCEEDS GO TO THE YELLOW
RIBBON FUND, WHICH HELPS THE
FAMILIES OF WOUNDED VETERANS AT
WALTER REED AND BETHESDA NAVAL
HOSPITALS.
AND FOLKS...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE ARE OFFERING A TERRIFYING
LINE OF PREMIUM PRODUCTS, LIKE
THIS OFFICIAL KEEP FEAR ALIVE
T-SHIRT, WHICH ON THE BACK SAYS,
"I HAVE A SCREAM."
OR THIS BUMPER STICKER, "K.F.A.
IN THE U.S.A.," WHICH STANDS FOR
KEEP FEAR ALIVE IN WHATEVER
U.S.A. STANDS FOR.
IT WILL LOOK GREAT ON YOUR
BUMPER, WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE
THANKS TO THE SPECIAL ADHESIVE,
IT'S NEVER COMING OFF.
AND THAT WILL TAKE A NICE BITE
OUT OF YOUR CAR'S RESALE VALUE.
WE ALSO HAVE THIS STYLISH HATCH
RIGHT HERE WITH THE WORD "BOO"
ON THE BACK.
THAT'S SPOOKY.
HAIR NEVER MESSES UP.
OF COURSE, NO MARCH ON
WASHINGTON WOULD BE COMPLETE
WITHOUT ITS OWN BUTTON.
OKAY.
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, WHICH ALSO
COMES STANDARD WITH A STABBING
IMPLEMENT.
( LAUGHTER )
COULD EASILY TAKE OUT AN EYE.
OKAY.
AND BECAUSE IT'S HALLOWEEN
WEEKEND, WE'RE OFFERING THIS
KEEP FEAR ALIVE APPLE FILLED
WITH RAZOR BLADES.
( LAUGHTER )
LEGAL SAYS WE CAN'T SELL THE
APPLE.
OKAY.
WELL, INSTEAD WE ALSO HAVE THIS
TERRIFYING PENNANT, WHICH IT'S
FILLED WITH RAZOR BLADES.
WHAT?
I'M BEING TOLD THE PENNANT ALSO
CANNOT HAVE RAZOR BLADES IN IT.
OKAY.
IN THAT CASE IT WILL JUST WITH
MADE IN A FACTORY THAT ALSO
PROCESSES PEANUTS.
( LAUGHTER )
SO GO TO KEEPFEARALIVE.COM AND
ORDER UP YOUR MERCHANDISE.
( APPLAUSE )
AND HELP OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS.
NOW, FOLKS, THERE IS ONE SMALL
DETAIL ABOUT THIS MARCH THAT HAS
ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.
I FORGOT TO APPLY FOR A PERMIT.
I MEAN, SINCE WHEN DO YOU NEED A
PERMIT TO VISIT THE MALL IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.,?
PEOPLE PICNIC THERE ALL THE
TIME.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS I WANT TO
PICNIC WITH THOUSANDS OF FRIENDS
AND A STADIUM SOUND SYSTEM.
WHAT'S THE BIGGIE?
I'LL PUT DOWN A BLANK ET.
WELL, I INFORMED THE NATIONAL
PARK SERVICE OF MY PREDICAMENT,
AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
THEIR RESPONSE ALL DAY LONG.
MY FAX MACHINE.
HOLD ON.
( LAUGHTER )
"DEAR MR. COLBERT, YOU ARE SO
SCREWED.
SINCERELY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT."
OKAY.
BUT, FOLKS, DO NOT CANCEL YOUR
PLANS.
I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF
PLACES IN D.C. WHERE WE CAN HOLD
A MARCH.
I MEAN, PLACES OFF THE BEATEN
PATH WHERE LIKE-MINDED FOLKS CAN
GATHER TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,
WHEREVER CONGRESSMEN GO FOR
SECRET GAY LIAISONS.
AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS, I HAVE
BEEN WORKING ON A BACK-UP PLAN.
MY COUSIN MARTY LIVES IN
ALEXANDRIA, AND HE SAID WE COULD
USE HIS BASEMENT IF WE CLEAR OUT
THE DRUM SET AND IF AFTER THE
RALLY WE HELP HIM PUT TOGETHER
