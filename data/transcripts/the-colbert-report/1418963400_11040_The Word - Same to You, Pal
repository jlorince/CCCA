"COLBERT REPORT," I HAVE SOMETERRIBLE NEWS.
( LAUGHTER )THIS, IN FACT IS YOUR LAST TIME
TUNING INTO THE "COLBERTREPORT."

FOLKS, UNTIL 10 YEARS FROM NOW,WHEN THEY REBOOT IT DIRECTED BY
J.J. ABRAMS.
MAN, I AM GOING TO WRECK SOME( BLEEP ) WITH ONE OF THOSE NEW
LIGHTSABERS.
NOW, BECAUSE I AM ATRANSFORMATIONAL HISTORICAL
FIGURE-- THAT IS, I HAVE BEEN ONTV-- MANY OF THE THINKERATI OUT
THERE ARE ASKING WHAT MIGHTLEGACY IS.
WELL, ULTIMATELY, I BELIEVEHISTORY WILL BE MY JUDGE.
SO I'M GOING TO TELL HISTORYWHAT TO SAY, AND THAT BRINGS US
TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )SAME TO YOU, PAL.
FOLKS, LET'S NOT PUSSY FOOTAROUND HERE.
I HAD A HUGE IMPACT.
NEED MORE EVIDENCE?
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK THE SAGINAWSPIRIT MINI MASCOT STEAGLE
COLDBEAGLE THE EAGLE.
OKAY.
THAT HAPPENED.
I DON'T REMEMBER CRONKITE EVERHAVING A MASCOT.
BUT, FOLKS, I'M NOT HERE TO BRAGABOUT HAVING CHANGED THE WORLD.
NOW I DID SOMETHING MUCH HARDERTHAN CHANGE THE WORLD.
FOLKS, I-- I SAMED THE WORLD.
NOW, DOES THAT SOUND STUPID?
WELL, THEY SAID I SOUNDED STUPIDBACK IN 2005, SO THAT'S THE
SAME.
( LAUGHTER )AND, FOLKS, LOOK AROUND.
ANOTHER-- ANOTHER BUSH GOVERNORIS RUNNING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
PEOPLE ON TV ARE DEFENDINGTORTURE.
WE ARE SENDING TROOPS INTO IRAQ.
AND JUST TAKE THE N.B.A.
CHAMPIONSHIPS, BOTH IN 2005 AND2014.
I HAD TO LOOK UP WHO WON.
NOW, FOLKS, IF YOU REMEMBER,WHEN THIS SHOW BEGAN, I
PROMISED YOU A REVOLUTION, AND IDELIVERED.
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY ONEREVOLUTION IS 360 DEGREES RIGHT
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S THE TRUTH.
BUT LIKE MARY POPPINS OR GANDHI,GANDHI-- I GET THEM CONFUSED.
I THINK THEY BOTH HAD THOSEFLYING UMBRELLAS.
FOLKS, NOW--( LAUGHTER )
NOW IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO.
AND-->> OOH!
>> Stephen: NO, AND WHILE I'VEALWAYS REMINDED YOU TO BE
AFRAID, FOLKS, I DON'T WANT YOUTO WORRY.
YOU SEE, ON MY VERY FIRST SHOW,I TOLD YOU TRUTH DOESN'T COME
FROM YOUR HEAD.
IT COMES FROM YOUR GUT.
AND BACK THEN, MY GUT MADE YOU APROMISE.
I KNOW SOME OF YOU MAY NOT TRUSTYOUR GUT YET, BUT WITH MY HELP,
YOU WILL.
AND YOU DID.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BECAUSE THE TRUTHINESS IS--
( APPLAUSE )I'LL JOIN THAT.
I'LL JOIN THAT.
WHATEVER WE'RE APPLAUDING RIGHTNOW, I'M IN.
BECAUSE THE TRUTHINESS IS ALLTHOSE INCREDIBLE THINGS PEOPLE
SAY I DID-- RUNNING FORPRESIDENT.
SAVING THE OLYMPICS.
COLBERT SUPER PAC.
TREADMILL IN SPACE.
THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITYAND/OR FEAR AND/OR CAT STEVENS'
CAREER-- NONE OF THAT, NONE OFTHAT WAS REALLY ME.
YOU, THE NATION, DID ALL OFTHAT.
I JUST GOT PAID FOR IT.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANKS.

THAT WAS-- THAT WAS REALLY COOLOF YOU GUYS.
( LAUGHTER )FOLKS, I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE AMERICA, GODDAMNIT.

AND HE STARTED MTV UP THERE.
( LAUGHTER )SO IN THE ANNALS OF HISTORY-- OR
WHATEVER ORIFICE THEY STUFF ITIN-- LET NO ONE SAY WHAT WE DID
TOGETHER WAS NOT IMPORTANT ORINFLUENTIAL OR IMPORTU-LENTIAL.
YOU SEE, FROM THE BEGINNING,FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY SHOW,
IT WAS MY GOAL TO LIVE UP TO THENAME OF THIS NETWORK, INFLUENCE
CENTRAL.
AND IF WE ALL WE ACHIEVED OVERTHE LAST NINE YEARS WAS TO COME
INTO YOUR HOME EACH NIGHT ANDHELP YOU MAKE A DIFFICULT DAY A
LITTLE BIT BETTER, MAN, WHAT AWASTE.
AND, NATION, I WANT YOU TO KNOW,IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL AGAIN, IF
I COULD DO IT WITH YOU, I WOULDDO IT THE SAME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
