FOLKS, YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING
TO SRAOEUD WITH THE TEACHERS.
THEY THOUGHT THEM HOW TO COUNT.
THERE'S NOTHING AMERICANS LOVE
MORE THAN BRITISH ROYALTY.
IT WAS WHAT OUR COUNTRY WAS
FOUNDED ON ON AGAINST WHAT
REMEMBERS.
RIGHT NOW THE BRITISH ROYALS ARE
TOASTS OF CABLE NEWS.
>> CAN I TELL YOU HERE IN THE
UNITED STATES WE'RE VERY
INTERESTED IN THE WEDDING.
>> WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE UP IN
THALS.
>> ARE YOU SO EXCITED?
>> SO EXCITED.
>> ROYAL WEDDING FEVER.
>> Stephen: YES, EVERYONE IN
THE NEWS HAS ROYAL WEDDING
FEVER.
SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DIZZINESS,
NAUSEA AND NOT HAVING TO TALK
ABOUT ATROCITIES IN THE IVORY
COAST.
FOR SOME REASON MY INVITATION
HAS NOT YET ARRIVED BUT I'M SURE
I'M GETTING ONE AND WHEN I DO, I
WANT TO BE READY BECAUSE WHEN
YOU MEET RULE AT THIS THEY HAVE
A SPECIFIC -- ROYALTY THEY HAVE
A SPECIFIC SET OF RULES AND PROT
COALS THAT -- PROT COLLS THAT
MUST BE OBSERVED.
NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE
QUEEN.
NO EYE CONTACT.
IF SHE STARTING GROWLING, DON'T
PANIC.
SHE CAN SMELL FEAR.
STAND STILL AND EVENTUALLY
SHE'LL SEEK OTHER PREY.
[LAUGHTER]
WATCH AND LEARN AS I PREPARE FOR
WILL AND KATE'S BIG DATE.
THIS IS.
♪ MY FAIR COLBERT:  STEPHEN
COLBERT'S CROWN JEWELS ♪
IN MY QUEST TO MAKE SURE THAT I
WAS ROYAL READY, I HEADED TO TEA
AND SYMPATHY TO MEET HISTORIAN
AND ROYAL BUY OG GRAPHIER HUGO
VICARS.
♪ ♪
WELCOME TO TEA AND SYMPATHY,
VERY ENGLISH.
I ASSUME THIS IS WHERE
BUCKINGHAM PAL PALACE LOOKS
LIKE.
>> THEY HAVE CHINA IN BUCKINGHAM
PALACE BUT IT'S A BETTER
QUALITY.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU THE
GUY TO TEACH ME ABOUT HOW TO
HANDLE MYSELF AROUND THE ROYALS.
>> I STARTED THIS WHEN I WAS
ABOUT 14 YEARS OLD.
I MET THE QUEEN DURING THAT
PHASE.
I WAS A ROYALTY SPOTTER, IF YOU
LIKE.
I USED TO CUT OUT SPOTS IN THE
NEWSPAPER.
IT COULD HAVE ENDED UP LIKE A
FAN COLLECTOR.
>> Stephen: ALSO SOUNDS LIKE
THE BEHAVIOR OF A SERIAL KILLER.
>> THAT,, TOO POSSIBLY BUT FOR
ME NOT SO.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE AN ENGLISHMAN?
>> I AM.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE DRESSED
LIKE AN AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN.
>> I'M DRESSED FORMALLY, IT'S
TRUE.
A PINSTRIPE SUIT, A WHITE SHIRT
AND A STIFF COLLAR.
ARE YOU GOING TO ARRIVE WITH A
STIFFY ON THE DAY?
>> Stephen: CAN I ARRIVE WITH
A STIFFY WHENEVER I WANT.
IS THIS A STIFFY?
>> YES IT IS.
>> Stephen: IS IT ESSENTIAL
TOLL AHAVE A STIFFY WHEN YOU
MEET THE QUEEN?
DOES SHE LIKE THE STIFFY?
>> AS AN AMERICAN GENTLEMAN
COMING OVER SHE WOULD BE
IMPRESSED WITH YOU TAKING THE
TROUBLE.
>> Stephen: NO TROUBLE AT ALL.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROYALS.
CAN WE DO THAT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THE KING AND QUEEN
ARE YOUR BRAD AND ANGELINA THEY
ARE THE AMBASSADORS OF THE
WORLD.
>> THEY ARE SYMBOLS.
>> Stephen: SHE'S THE STATUE
OF LIBERTY OF ENGLAND.
>> MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE SHE
HAS INCREDIBLE ACCUMULATED
KNOWLEDGE.
SHE SAYS TO THE PRIME MINISTER
IN 1961 WE HAD A SIMILAR THING.
HE WASN'T BORN.
THERE SHE HAS A GOOD MEMORY.
>> Stephen: YOU PEOPLE DON'T
WRITE ANYTHING DOWN?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE QUEEN TO
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN 1961.
>> THE POINT IS IF HE GOES SO
SEE HER SHE WOULD REMEMBER
ANOTHER CONVERSATION WITH
ANOTHER PRIME MINISTER.
>> Stephen: SORRY I DIDN'T
KNOW IF YOU HAD A WRITTEN
LANGUAGE OR -- AT THE WEDDING
WHAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO
OBJECT?
>> I REALLY WOULDN'T DO IT.
YOU WOULD BE MOVED QUICKLY OUT
OF ABBEY AND THEY MAY FIND A
TREASON ACT.
>> Stephen: THEY WANT TO KNOW
HOW I GOT IN.
>> YOU WOULDN'T UNLESS YOU HAVE
A TICKET.
>> Stephen: I WOULD SAY YOU
GAVE IT TO ME.
>> I WOULDN'T BE AT THE WEDDING.
I'LL BE IN THE STUDIO FOR EIGHT
HOURS TELLING EVERYBODY WHAT IS
GOING ON.
>> Stephen: FOR THE BBC?
>> ASSOCIATED PRESS TELEVISION
NEWS.
>> Stephen: WHO HAS THE BBC
GOT HUGH EDWARDS --
>> THEY'VE GOT HUGH EDWARDS.
>> Stephen: CAN WE GET HUGH
EDWARDS?
YOU ARE DOING A GREAT  JOB.

>> YOU DON'T HAVE A STIFF UPPER
LIP WHEN YOU ARE DRINKING TEA.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU ARE MAKING THAT FACE RIGHT
NOW.
THE FACE YOU ARE MAKING ME RIGHT
NOW IS THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> KEEP DRINKING THE TEA.
>> Stephen: WALK ME THROUGH
IT.
>> I DECIDE TO HAVE A CUP OF
TEA.
I PUT MY LEMON IN AND MY SUGAR.
TAKE MY NAPKIN NEXT.
>> Stephen: I BEAT YOU.

>> Stephen: YOU KNOW THE ONE
THING I'VE GOT TO DO IS -- I'VE
GOT TO GET -- I GET THAT OUT
THERE RIGHT THERE.
>> IT DOESN'T STICK OUT AT ALL.
>> Stephen: I'M PRETTY SURE IT
DOES.
>> IT DOESN'T.
YOU ASKED ME TO COME HERE TO
HELP YOU.
PUT IT AWAY.
I'LL HELP YOU MAKE A GOOD
IMPRESSION.
KEEP IT IN.
DON'T DRAW ATTENTION TO IT.
NO, NO.
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
>> Stephen: NO, NO, NO.
OKAY YOU DON'T DO THAT EITHER.
COME ON.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP.
[LAUGHTER]

PUT IT IN AND PUT IT BACK.
DON'T STEAL THE SPOON EITHER.

>> Stephen: YOU ARE NOT HAVING
CREAM.
>> PUT IT DOWN DON'T DUNK.

[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: A LITTLE BIT IN
THE OLD PIPE THERE.
ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE SOME?
>> A LITTLE, YES.
NOT LIKE THAT.
TOO MUCH.
NOT IN THE TEA.
THAT'S RATHER A LOT, I THINK.
>> Stephen: NOT IN AMERICA.
>> YOU HAVE VERY BAD TABLE
MANNERS GENERALLY.
THAT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
DID YOU NEVER HAVE A NANNY AT
HOME?
THE PINKY IS UP AGAIN.
PUT IT DOWN.
AND IN.
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT UP TO
THE NURSERY.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY
HOPELESS.
YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT YOU
COULD POSSIBLY DO WRONG.
>> Stephen: I WAS READY FOR
ROYALTY.
JOIN ME TOMORROW WHEN I LEARN
THE PROTOCOL FOR MEETING HER
MAJESTY.
I REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT HOW,
HOW YOU SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT
TALK TO THE ROYALS AND THINK TO
YOURSELF I'VE WASTED MY LIFE.
