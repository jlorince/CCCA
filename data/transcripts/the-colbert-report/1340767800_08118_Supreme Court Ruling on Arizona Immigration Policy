>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT" EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE "REPORT."
RIGHT OFF THE BAT I WANT TO THANK SOME OF YOU FOR JOINING US.
(LAUGHTER) BUT ONLY SOME.
BECAUSE SOME OF YOU ARE NOT WELCOME AT ALL.
OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT LOS ILLEGALS WHICH, OF COURSE, IS SPANISH FOR MEXICAN.
(LAUGHTER) WE ARE POWERLESS AGAINST THEM,
FOLKS, THANKS TO THE SUPREME COURT YESTERDAY OVERTURNING ARIZONA S.B.-1080, ARIZONA'S
ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY IN OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT FEDERAL
IMMIGRATION POLICY OF NOT HAVING AN IMMIGRATION POLICY.
(LAUGHTER) IT WAS A 5-3 DECISION WITH ELENA KAGAN RECUSING HERSELF AND SONIA
SOTOMAYOR ALLOWED TO VOTE ONLY AFTER SHE SHOWED HER PAPERS.
(LAUGHTER) NATION, NATION, THIS DECISION IS A DISASTER PARTLY BECAUSE IT
THROWS OPEN OUR COUNTRY'S BORDERS BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY NOW HAS TO EXPRESS AN
OPINION THAT MIGHT UPSET HIS PICK VOTERS.
OF COURSE, IT'S GREAT FOR OBAMA,
HE'S BEEN PANDERING TO LATINOS ALL YEAR.
WHAT WITH LAST WEEK OFFERING TO LET YOUNG ILLEGALS STAY AND, OF COURSE, HIS SHAMEFUL ENTRANCE AT
THE STATE OF THE UNION.
>> MR. SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!
(PLAYING "MEXICAN HAT DANCE") (LAUGHTER) CLEARLY MITT ROMNEY HAD TO GET
ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE.
SO LAST NIGHT HE TOLD A ROOM OF 200 DONORS IN ARIZONA "I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO SEE THE
SUPREME COURT GIVE MORE LATITUDE TO THE STATES, NOT LESS, THERE ARE STATES NOW UNDER THIS
DECISION THAT HAVE LESS AUTHORITY, LESS LATITUDE TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS.
AND STATES HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN IMMIGRATION LAWS.
AS JUSTICE SCALIA SAID YESTERDAY IN A FIERY DISSENT "IN THE FIRST
100 YEARS OF THE REPUBLIC THE STATES ENACTED NUMEROUS LAWS RESTRICTING THE IMMIGRATION OF
CERTAIN CLASSES OF ALIENS INCLUDING CONVICTED CRIMINALS,
INDIGENTS, PERSONS WITH CONTAGIOUS DISEASES AND, IN SOUTHERN STATES, FREED BLACKS."
(AUDIENCE REACTS) YES, THE FIRST 100 YEARS OF THE REPUBLIC.
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
(LAUGHTER) BEFORE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STARTED A WAR OVER HIS FEDERAL FETISH AND
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE STATES WERE UNDER A SINGLE SET OF LAOS AND ALL THE VAMPIRES ARE DEAD.
(LAUGHTER) WE MUST RETURN TO OUR FOUNDER'S DREAM OF EVERY STATE DECIDING
WHO IT COULD TURN AWAY AT ITS BORDER.
NOW, I BELIEVE THAT WHEN I HEAD HOME TO CONNECTICUT AFTER WORK I SHOULD HAVE TO SHOW MY PAPERS--
ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY DRAG OFF MY DRIVER LUIS FOR FORGETTING HIS.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S EASY.
50 STATES; 50 IMMIGRATION POLICIES.
EVERY STATE GETS ITS OWN BIRD,
RIGHT?
IF GEORGIA CAN SAY YES TO THE BROWN THRASHER WHY CAN'T SOUTH CAROLINA SAY NO TO THE BROWN GUATEMALAN?
(LAUGHTER) SCALIA'S RIGHT.
IF ARIZONA IS A SOVEREIGN STATE IT SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN IMMIGRATION STANDARDS, ITS OWN
STANDING ARMY, ITS OWN CURRENCY,
ITS OWN OLYMPIC TEAM, ITS OWN SPACE PROGRAM, AND ITS OWN DEBTS WITH CHINA.
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE STRONG STATES RIGHTS ARE WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY.
NO, JIMMY, NO,
