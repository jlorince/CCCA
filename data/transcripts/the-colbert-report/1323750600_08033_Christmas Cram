>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO
HAVE YOU WITH US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO
MUCH, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
AND A MERRY CHRISTMAS,
NATION.
AND IT IS ABOUT DAMN TIME, I
GOT TO SAY.
SO FAR THIS YEAR I HAVE
REALLY BEEN LETTING
CHRISTMAS DOWN.
IT'S MY LAST WEEK OF SHOWS
BEFORE OUR CHRISTMAS BREAK
AND I HAVE BEEN SOARLY
REMISS IN MY BELL JINGLING,
MY YULE LOGGING AND MY ANGEL
HARKING SO I'M MAKING UP FOR
IT TONIGHT.
I'M CRAMMING A FULL ADVENT'S
WORTH OF CHEER ON TO MY SET.
JIMMY LET'S DECK MY HALLS,
BUDDY BOY.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK AT ALL THIS
GOOD STUFF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I GOT A GREAT DEAL-- I HAVE
GOT A GREAT DEAL ON ALL THIS
STUFF.
THE TRICK IS YOU TAKE ONE
THING FROM EACH LAWN YOU
PASS ON YOUR WAY TO WORK.
NOW FIRST I'VE GOT MY WREATH
DOWN HERE AND OF COURSE MY
CHRISTMAS BALANCES.
ACTUAL SIZE.
AND OVER THERE I'VE GOT MY
THREE WISEMEN, MELTHIOR,
BALTHAZAR AND ABOMINABLE.
OF COURSE YOU REMEMBER THE
TRUE MEANING OF THE SEASON.
I HAVE A NATIVITY SCENE WITH
MY PEABODY WHERE THE BABY
JESUS WOULD BE.
BUT I WANT TO STRESS THIS IS
ACCURATE TO WHAT THE MANAGER
WOULD LOOK LIKE IF JESUS HAD
WON A PEABODY AWARD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: AN OF COURSE,
FOLKS, NO CHRISTMAS WOULD BE
COMPLETE WITHOUT MISTLE TOE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH BOY, OH BOY.
OH, HEY.
HI THERE.
LATER.
(LAUGHTER)
SO MERRY CHRISTMAS,
EVERYBODY.
TO ALL MY JEWISH VIEWERS,
