OH, HI! I WAS JUST ABOUT TOMAKE MYSELF ONE OF MY WORLD FAMOUS BURRITOS.
I START WITH A HAND-PRESSEDFLOUR TORILLA, AND THEN I FILL
IT WITH A MICROWAVE BURRITO.
THIS TORTILLA WAS MADE BYMISSION FOODS WHOSE TORTILLA
FACTORY IS LOCATED IN THE 76THINSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART
SERIES...
BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT!
TONIGHT:CALIFORNIA'S 29TH, THE FIGHTIN'
29TH!
THE 29TH IS NESTLED INCALIFORNIA'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
AND ALSO CONTAINS PARTS OF LOSANGELES.
THE DISTRICT'S MEDIAN AGE IS32.6, BUT IT TELLS CASTING
DIRECTORS THAT IT JUST TURNED26.3.
THE REGION WAS ORIGINALLY HOMETO A NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE KNOWN
AS THE TATAVIAM, OR "PEOPLEFACING THE SUN".
WHICH IS WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS SOEASY TO BEAT AT TENNIS.
IN THE LATE 18TH CENTURY,SPANISH EXPLORERS WERE DRAWN TO
THEREGION BY THE PROMISE OF
SUNSHINE, WARM WEATHER, AND EASYACCESS TO THE 405 FREEWAY.
SOME OF THEM ARE STILL STUCK INTRAFFIC.
IN THE 1840S, THE REGIONEXPIERENCED A BRIEF GOLD RUSH,
LEADING THE FIRST SAN FERNANDO.
VALLEY PROSPECTORS TO SAY:(VALLEY GIRL ACCENT...)
"UH MA GOD, LOOK AT THIS GOLD,IT'S, LIKE, TOTALLY GOLDEN."
GOLD!
THE 29TH IS HOME TO THE CLOTHINGBRAND JUICY COUTURE, WHO ARE
KNOWN BOTH FOR THEIR VELOURTRACKSUITS AND THEIR CHARITY
WORK.
TEACHING TEEN-AGED BOYS TO READ.
THE DISTRICT IS HOME TO 46 PORNSTUDIOS, INCLUDING "PINK
VISUAL," FAMOUS FOR SUCH TITLESAS "BUBBLE BUTTS GALORE" AND
"ASIAN SLUT INVASION, VOLUME 3."
I KNOW, ANOTHER SEQUEL.

INVASION IDEA?
