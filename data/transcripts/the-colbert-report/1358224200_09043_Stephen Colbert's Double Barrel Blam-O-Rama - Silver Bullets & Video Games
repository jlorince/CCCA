[CHOWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
SIT DOWN.
WE WILL TOM COT REPORT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING, FOLKS.
I WAS JUST DOWN IN MY UNDERGROUND BUNKER, MAKING PREPARATIONS.
IT'S BEST THAT I DON'T DIVULGE TOO MANY DETAILS BECAUSE
[WHISPERING] I'M STARTING TO SUSPECT THIS PLACE IS LOADED WITH MICROPHONES AND CAMERAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, BUT DOWN IN THE BUNKER, I'M READY FOR THAT DARK TOMORROW WHEN JACK-BOOTED GOVERNMENT
THUGS COME FOR OUR GUNS.
THAT'S WHERE THE GHILLIE SUIT COMES IN.
LET'S SAY THE GOVERNMENT BUSTS IN HERE LOOKING TO ARREST ME BECAUSE I'M A GUN OWNER AND HAUL
ME OFF TO ONE OF THOSE JAILS WHERE YOU CAN'T BRING YOUR GUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, THEY HAVE 'EM.
THEY ALREADY HAVE THEM SET UP, OKAY?
THE MINUTE THEY BUST DOWN THAT DOOR, I JUST DO THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
"HEY, WHERE'S COLBERT?
>> HE'S NOT HERE.
JUST A PILE OF GRASS CLIPPINGS ON HIS DESK.
PERFECTLY NORMAL.
AND I'M HOME FREE.
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET ONE OF THESE, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S SLIMMING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, TOMORROW IS THE DAY REICH MARSHAL VON AMTRAK HAS PROMISED TO ISSUE HIS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
GUN CONTROL.
>> I'M GOING TO BE SUBMITTING TO THE PRESIDENT A PROPOSAL AS TO HOW TO PROCEED.
I'M SHOOTING FOR TUESDAY.
WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET.
>> Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY'RE TAKING AWAY OUR SILVER BULLETS.
HOW WILL WE DEFEND OURSELVES FROM WEREWOLF BANDITS?!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO WITH OUR GUNS UNDER ATTACK WE'RE DEVOTING AN ENTIRE ACT OF THE SHOW TONIGHT TO A
THOUGHTFUL, SENSITIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.
THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S DOUBLE-BARREL BLAM-O-RAMA!"
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SADLY, FOLKS, PEOPLE WITH EXTREME POSITIONS CAN OFTEN DOMINATE THIS DEBATE. BUT THERE
ARE REASONABLE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, WHO ARE REASONABLY TRYING TO BLAME ANYTHING BUT GUNS.
FOR INSTANCE HOLLYWOOD.
JUST LOOK AT HOW MANY OF THIS YEAR'S OSCAR NOMINEES GLAMORIZE GUNS: "DJANGO UNCHAINED,"
"ZERO DARK THIRTY," "ARGO," "LINCOLN" AND THE WORST ONE OF ALL "LES MISERABLES."
WHO AMONG US DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT RUSSELL CROWE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND MOVIES AREN'T THE ONLY CULPRIT.
THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE MEDIA OUR KIDS CONSUME.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MEDIA ADULTS CONSUME?
>> WHY DOES CONGRESS ALWAYS TAKE AIM, IF YOU WILL, AT GUNS?
>> YOU'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT SOCIETY, VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES
>> THESE ARE MURDER SIMULATORS.
THEY REHEARSE THE ACTION.
>> THE EXTRAORDINARY REALISM TO VIDEO GAMES AND MOVIES NOW, ET CETERA, DOES CAUSE VULNERABLE
YOUNG MEN, PARTICULARLY, TO BE MORE VIOLENT.
>> Stephen: TRUE, AND IN A LOT OF THESE GAMES THEY'RE NOT JUST USING GUNS BUT CROWBARS,
BASEBALL BATS, AND EVEN CHAINSAWS.
THAT PUTS FRIGHTENING IDEAS IN KIDS' HEADS.
AT THIS POINT, IF I SEE A TEENAGER COMING AT ME WITH A CHAINSAW, I'M SORRY, BUT I CROSS
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, VIDEO GAME VIOLENCE IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM.
WHO CAN FORGET, IN THE WAKE OF SIM CITY, HOW CHILDREN EVERYWHERE TOOK UP URBAN PLANNING?
[ LAUGHTER ]
