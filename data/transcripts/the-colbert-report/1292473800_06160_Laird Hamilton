EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SURFING
LEGEND WHO HAS RIDDEN WAVES OVER
100 FEET TALL.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,
THAT'S HIGH ENOUGH FOR THIS GUY
TO BE INSANE.
PLEASE WELCOME LAIRD HAMILTON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, LAIRD, NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> APPRECIATE IT.
>> LISTEN, I AM AN ADMIRER OF
WHAT YOU DO PHYSICALLY.
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BUT I GOT TO HAMMER YOU HERE FOR
A SECOND.
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
YOU READY TO RIDE THIS WAVE?
>> BEST I CAN.
>> GET A JOB.
OKAY.
TIME TO GROW UP.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE MAN NOW.
OKAY.
STOP PLAYING AROUND.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST... WHY DON'T
YOU JUST PLAY VOLLEYBALL FOR A
LIVING.
>> I KNOW PEOPLE THAT DO THAT.
>> Stephen: I KNOW YOU DO.
YOUR WIFE, GABRIELLE REESE,
SHE'S ALSO AN UNBELIEVABLY
BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY, OUTDOORSY
KIND OF ATHLETIC PERSON.
HERE'S MY FIRST QUESTION: WHICH
OF YOU LETS IT GO AND GETS FAT
FIRST.
>> DOESN'T HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T HAPPEN?
>> DOESN'T HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YOU ARE,
SIR, YOU ARE THE SUBJECT OF A
BOOK CALLED "THE WAVE.
: IN PURSUIT OF THE ROGUE,
FREAKS AND GIANTS OF THE OCEAN."
WHY DO YOU DO WHAT YOU DO?
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP CHASING
BIGGER AND BIGGER WAVES?
DO YOU CHASE BIGGER AND BIGGER
WAVES?
>> I DO.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT MY FATHER ONCE SAID WHEN I
WAS YOUNG THAT BIG WAVE RIDERS
ARE BEEN AND NOT MADE.
YOU DON'T BECOME ONE.
YOU JUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE BORN WITH THAT IS WHY DO
MEN WANT TO GO TO THE MT.
EVEREST AND IF THERE WAS A
BIGGER MOUNTAIN, THEY WOULD GO
THERE.
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S IN ME
THAT I CONTINUE TO DESIRE THE
PURSUIT OF THAT CHALLENGE AND
EXPERIENCE TO RIDE, YOU KNOW,
RIDE THESE ROGUES AND FREAKS OF
THE OCEAN.
>> DOES IT CHANGE A PERSON TO DO
THIS FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR?
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE LIKE
IF YOU WEREN'T DOING THIS?
THIS IS A WHOLE LIFESTYLE,
RIGHT?
>> I'D HAVE A LOT LESS INJURIES,
FIRST OF ALL.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
HURT OUT THERE?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER HURT
THE OCEAN?
>> SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.
>> Stephen: SHE DIDN'T TELL
YOU.
LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU OUT
THERE?
>> I'M HAD SIX BROKEN ANKLES AND
PUNCTURE CHEEKS AND RIB CAGE.
IT'S A LONG, LONG LIST.
>> Stephen: IS THAT FROM OTHER
SURERS, THE OCEAN?
>> ALL OF IT.
EQUIPMENT, OTHER SURFERS.
THE MOST DANGEROUS THING ARE
PEOPLE.
THEY ACT SPORADICALLY.
WAVES ARE CONSISTENT AND RELIKE.
NATURE DOESN'T ALL OF A SUDDEN
DO SOMETHING UNUSUAL.
IT IS VERY DEPENDENTABLE IN ITS
CHARACTERISTICS AND HUMANS ON
THE OTHER HAND AREN'T.
>> Stephen: IS THERE AN OFF
SEASON FOR YOU?
>> I KIND OF MAKE MYSELF HAVE AN
OFF SEASON.
THE SUMMERTIME, WHICH IS WHEN
THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IS KIND
OF SHUT DOWN, THE SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE ACTTY INTEREST RATES.
THAT'S WHEN WE GET...
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHUTS DOWN?
>> I JUST MEAN ALL THE BIG
STORMS THAT HAPPEN IN THE
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE THAT CREATE
ALL THE SNOW AND ALL THE COLD
WEATHER HERE, AS WELL, PRODUCE
SURF.
THAT'S WHEN THE SURF IS THE
BIGGEST, DURING LIKE JANUARY AND
FEBRUARY THE SURF IS THE
BIGGEST.
THEN WHEN YOU GO INTO THE
SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, IT'S IN
JULY AND AUGUST.
>> Stephen: SO IS GLOBAL
WARMING GOOD OR BAD FOR YOU?
DO YOU WANT MOREEN JOY IN THE
EARTH, SO MORE ENERGY MEANS
BIGGER WAVES?
IS THAT IT.
>> IT'S BOTH.
GLOBAL WARMING CAN CREATE BIGGER
STORMS AND HAS AND IS GOING TO,
AND THAT'S GREAT FOR ME
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, SO THERE IS A PLUS SIDE.
( LAUGHTER )
MAYBE ECOSYSTEMS ARE WIPED OUT,
BUT YOU GET TASTY WAVE.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S A TRADE-OFF.
IT'S A TRADE-OFF.
>> IT'S A SELFISH ACT.
>> Stephen: JIM, ROLL THIS
FOOTAGE OF LAIRD COMING IN ON A
WAVE HERE.
THERE YOU ARE.
HOW BIG IS THIS WAVE YOU'RE
GOING TO BE RIDING HERE?
IS IT AVERAGE?
>> IT PROBABLY HAS A 60 OR
07-FOOT FACE.
THIS IS A SEVEN-STORY BUILDING
AT ITS APEX.
>> Stephen: AND IT'S HIGHER
THAN A HELICOPTER.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: AT ANY POINT DO
YOU SAY, I'VE MADE A HUGE
MISTAKE WITH MY LIFE?
>> I'VE SAID I'VE MADE A HUGE
MISTAKE WHILE RIDE WAVING, NOT
THE LIFE PART.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S TO BE DONE?
WHEN THAT THING FALLS ON TOP OF
YOU, WHAT CAN YOU DO?
>> RELAX.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> TRY TO.
>> Stephen: DO YOU FIND IT
RELAXING?
>> AFTER I'M FINISHED.
>> Stephen: AFTER YOU'RE
FINISHED.
TO CALM DOWN AT NIGHT, DO YOU GO
HOME AND THROW YOURSELF IN THE
WASH MAG SHEEN AND SET IT ON THE
QUICK SPIN CYCLE?
>> I GO TO ALASKA AND TUMBLE
DOWN A MOUNTAIN THAT REPRESENTS
THE SAME SORT OF ACTIVE.
>> Stephen: WELL, AWESOME.
LAIRD HAMILTON, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
