>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SAYS THAT
BIG BUSINESS IS USING SMALL
BUSINESS AS THEIR BANK.
GOOD NEWS, WE STILL HAVE
SMALL BUSINESSES AND BANKS.
PLEASE WELCOME JEFF LEE
LEONARD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, MR. LEONARD.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
ON.
NOW SIR, LET-- WE'VE GOT A
KIND OF UN-- UNPACK YOUR
STORY FOR THE PEOPLE HERE.
YOU'VE GOT AN ARTICLE IN
THIS MONTH'S WASHINGTON
MONTHLY S IT A MONTHLY.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: WASHINGTON
MONTHLY IT SAYS WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO FOR
SMALL BUSINESS.
CORRECT?
>> IT DOESN'T A WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO FOR
SMALL BUSINESS IT SAYS
WHAT'S AILING SPALING
BUSINESS BECAUSE THE
QUESTION POLITICIANS AND THE
MEDIA ARE ASKINGING IS WHY
AREN'T SMALL BUSINESSES
HIRING MORE PEOPLE IN THIS
RECOVERY.
>> Stephen: TOO MUCH
GOVERNMENT REGULATION.
>> THAT'S ONE THING,
GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS
HURTING THEM.
HEALTH-CARE COSTS ARE
HURTING THEM.
THE FACT THEIR BANKS AREN'T
LENDING TO THEM IS HURTING
THEM.
BUT ANOTHER THING IS
INCREASINGLY THE BIG
COMPANIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED
TO PAY THEM IN 30 DAYS FOR
THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES ARE
PAYING THEM IN 60 AND 120
DAYS AND THEY'VE DONE THAT
SYSTEMICALLY AS A NEW
POLICY.
>> SO YOU CALL, THERE IS
SOMETHING CALLED NET 60,
EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS TO THE
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT
UNDERSTAND HIGH FINANCE THE
WAY I DO.
>> IT'S THAT-- IT'S THAT,
FROM THE DAY YOU PROVIDE AN
INVOICE AFTER YOU'VE
COMPLETED THE WORK T TAKES
THE BIG COMPANIES 60 DAYS TO
PAY YOU.
>> I HAVE TO PAY IF I'M A
SMALL BUSINESS I HAVE TO PAY
IN A MONTH TO EVERYBODY WHO
PROVIDES TO ME, CORRECT.
>> WELL, AND YOU HAVE TO PAY
BEFORE THAT TO BUY THE RAW
MATERIALS AND ALL THE
SUPPLIES AND THINGS YOU
NEED.
SO YOU ARE WAY MORE THAN A
MONTH.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE A BIG
COMPANY AND I'M A LITTLE
COMPANY AND YOU HIRE ME TO
DO SOMETHING FOR YOU FOR
YOUR BIG PROJECT.
I'M PAYING EVERYBODY OUT ON
TIME AND ARE YOU PAYING ME A
MONTH LATE AND YOU SAY ALL
THESE BIG BUSINESSES ARE
DOING IT NOW.
>> I WON'T SAY ALL OF THEM.
BUT LOOK, I'M JUST-- .
>> Stephen: NAME SOME NAMES,
NAME SOME NAMES.
>> I'M GOING AROUND TO SMALL
BUSINESSES HERE.
>> I GO AROUND THIS COUNTRY
AND I INVEST AND TALK TO
SMALL BUSINESSES ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY.
AND I'M IN CALIFORNIA WITH
ONE OF MY BUSINESSES AND
THEY SAY OH,-- JUST CHANGED
THEIR POLICY FROM NET 30.
NOW WE GET PAID NET 60 OR
MORE.
>> Stephen: IT IS A SPONSOR
SO WE'RE GOINGING TO TAKE
THAT OUT OF THIS, WE'RE
GOING TO EDIT THAT OUT LATER,
JUST BE PREPARED FOR THAT.
NAME SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE
WE CAN'T USE THEM.
>> OKAY.
SO ALL AROUND THIS COUNTRY
IN HARDWARE STORES THAT ARE
SELLING TO FORTUNE 100
COMPANIES OR A COMPANY IN
PENNSYLVANIA THAT IS
PROVIDING WASTE TREATMENT
SERVICES FOR BIG COMPANIES,
THEY ARE BEING TOLD THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO BE PAID
LATER AND LATER THAN THEY
USED TO.
>> BUT SO WHAT?
>> BECAUSE THAT IS THE
MARKET, OKAY IT IS WHAT THE
MARKET WILL BEAR AND THE
INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET
HAS SAID THAT THESE BIG
COMPANIES GET TO DO WHAT
THEY WANT AND THE SMALL
COMPANIES SHOULD EITHER GET
BIG OR GO HOME, RIGHT?
THAT'S A FREE MARKET, SIR.
>> MR. COLBERT-- .
>> Stephen: THAT IS MY NAME.
>> THERE ARE 20 MILLION
SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> OKAY.
>> Pirro: THEY CREATE 60% OF
THE JOBS CREATED IN THE LAST
DECADE.
>> Pirro: I KNOW, I READ THE
HAND OUTS.
>> SO YOU'RE GOOD WITH A
TELEPROMPTER BUT YOU HAVE
OBVIOUSLY NEVER MET A
PAYROLL BECAUSE-- ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT PLANNING-- .
>> Stephen: SIR, I AM A
RIVER UNTO MY PEOPLE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GO ON.
LET'S HEAR YOUR LITTLE
THEORY.
>> SO, PART OF THE ANSWER
HERE IS JUST TO BRING THIS
TO THE LIGHT OF DAY BECAUSE
IT'S REALLY, IT'S ABOUT THE
AMERICAN WAY OF SMALL
BUSINESSMAN IN THIS COUNTRY,
THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN BUILT
ON THE BACKS OF SMALL
BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: THAT MAY BE THE
CASE BUT DON'T ALL SMALL
BUSINESSMEN EVENTUALLY WANT
TO BECOME BIG BUSINESSMEN.
I GUESS WHAT I AM ASKING IS
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE
THE BIG BUSINESS DO WHAT YOU
WANT FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS?
DON'T THEY GET TO CALL THE
SHOTS?
>> I'M NOT GOD AND IT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT.
AND IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT
THE BIG BUSINESS.
IT'S ABOUT CHANGES IN THIS
ECONOMY THAT HAVE GIVEN
BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY THAT
KIND OF A POWER.
AND IT'S MORE ABOUT A BULLY
PULPIT.
YOU ASKED ABOUT WELL, SHOULD
GOVERNMENT DO THIS?
BUT GOVERNMENT ENABLES,
ALLOWS THE BANKS TO
FORECLOSE ON YOUR HOME, IF
YOU DON'T PAY WITHIN 30
DAYS.
AND IF YOU GO INTO ARREARS.
>> Stephen: YES.
>> SO EVERY GAME NEEDS A
REFEREE AND THIS IS A
PERFECT EXAMPLE WHERE THE
GOVERNMENT PAYS THEIR
CUSTOMERS.
AND EVERY BIG CORPORATION IN
AMERICA IS A HUGE CLIENT OF
THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY GET HUGE PROCUREMENT
ORDERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE GOVERNMENT PAYS IN
30 DAYS.
IF THE GOVERNMENT PAYS YOU
IN 30 DAYS WHY SHOULDN'T YOU
PAY YOUR SUPPLIERS IN 30
DAYS.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE NO ONE
CAN MAKE ME.
>> OH, THE GOVERNMENT-- .
>> Stephen: IF I DON'T PAY
NEW 30 DAYS I GET THE
INTEREST ON THAT MONEY THAT
I AM HOLDING ON TO, AND YOU
HAVE TO EAT ALL THE COST OF
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
>> DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT
IT.
TAKE IT ON THE ROAD.
YOU GO AND YOU TAKE THE SHOW
TO KANSAS CITY AND YOU TALK
AND YOU PUT SMALL
BUSINESSMEN IN THIS AUDIENCE
AND YOU LET THEM, AND YOU
HEAR FROM THEM WHAT'S GOING
ON IN THIS ECONOMY.
THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I AM
TALKING ABOUT.
>> Stephen: I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT WHAT IS FAIR AND WAS'S
NOT FAIR.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU CAN MAKE BUSINESS DO AND
NOT MAKE BUSINESS DO.
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
BACK YOUR SUGGESTION UP WITH,
SIR, GOVERNMENT REGULATION.
BECAUSE WHO ELSE IS GOING TO
FORCE-- YOU THINK THAT THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T MAKE
CONTRACTS WITH PEOPLE
WITHOUT DON'T PAY OFF IN 30
DAYS.
YOU SAID THAT, SIR.
>> HONESTLY.
>> Stephen: YOU DO SAY THAT
SIR.
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU DID NOT SAY
THAT.
>> I SAID THAT IS ONE REMEDY
THE GOVERNMENT COULD FOLLOW.
>> BUT DID YOU SAY THAT.
SO I JUST CAUGHT YOU IN A
LIE.
DHEERS PLAUS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IS GO ON, GO ON.
>> EXCELLENT.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO FIRE UP
PEOPLE THIS STRONGLY ABOUT
BOOKKEEPING.
I UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE ARE
HURTING OUT THERE.
BUT HOW DO YOU FORCE THE
COMPANY TO DO IT?
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT KNOWN
FOR THEIR SENSE OF SHAME.
>> YEAH, STEPHEN, HONESTLY,
I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT A
DIALOGUE IN THIS COUNTRY,
THE MEDIA.
IT'S ABOUT THE BULLY PULPIT
OF THE PRESIDENCY AND THE
GOVERNMENT SAYING WAIT A
MINUTE WHAT ABOUT THESE
PRACTICES.
WE HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS
ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS
SUPPOSED TO BE THE ADVOCATE,
GO ON THEIR WEB SITE.
THE ADVOCATE OF SMALL
BUSINESSES IN THIS COUNTRY.
WHY NOT STUDY THIS ISSUE.
AND WHY NOT CALL ATTENTION
TO IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT I
DON'T THINK MOST-- BIG
CORPORATE C.E.O.s EVEN KNOW
DOWN THE CHAIN THAT THIS IS
HAPPENING SO MUCH.
BECAUSE THESE PRACTICES ARE
HAPPENING WHY ARE THEY
HAPPENING?
WHEN MANY OF THESE COMPANIES
IF YOU LOOK ON THEIR WEB
SITES AND THEY SAY WHY DID
THEY CHANGE THEIR POLICIES
FROM PAYING NEINGT 30 TO 69
TO 120 DAYS, AND THEY'LL
TELL YOU BECAUSE EVERYONE
ELSE IS DOING TELEPHONE.
BECAUSE OUR CONSULTANTS SAID
THAT IT'S THE INDUSTRY NORM
NOW TO DO IT.
>> Stephen: SO THEY'RE LIKE
TEENAGERS.
>> WELL, AND MAYBE THEY'RE
LIKE TEENAGERS THAT IF IT
WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND
THEY WERE FORCED TO FESS UP
AND WE HAD A DIALOGUE ABOUT
IT AND BOTH IN THE MEDIA AND
AMONGST POLITICIANS, MAYBE
THEY WOULD NOT DO IT.
>> Stephen: IF THEY WERE
REALLY LIKE TEENAGERS AND WE
APPROACHED THESE
CORPORATIONS THEY WOULD
SCREAM I HATE YOU AND GO TO
YOUR ROOM.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
