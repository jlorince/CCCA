BUT THE POINT IS, FOLKS, THE
POINT IS WHEN IT COMES TO GITMO,
IGNORANCE IS BLISS.
HERE TO DEBLISS ME IS RETIRED
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER IN THE
JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL CORPS,
CHARLES SWIFT.
MR. SWIFT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SIR, YOU WERE-- YOU WERE ONE OF
THE LEAD ATTORNEYS FOR HANDAN.
AND HE WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN'S
DRIVER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Stephen:  YOU GUYS GOT HIM
OFF.
>> HE'S HOME IN YENL.
HE WAS ACQUITTED.
>> Stephen:  YOU GOT HIM OFF,
YOU GOT HIM OFF UPON YOU SPRUK
HIM.
YOU SPRUNG A TERRORIST.
GOOD FOR YOU.
>> ACTUALLY, I LIKE TONG THAT
DUE PROCESS WORKED AND AN
INNOCENT MAN WAS RELEASED AFTER
FIVE YEARS IN CAPTIVITY.
>> Stephen:  WE'LL NEVER KNOW
BECAUSE HE TO THE AWAY.
NOW, THESE GUYS ARE TERRORISTS
AT GITMO.
WHY DO WE CARE IF THEY'RE ON A
HUNGER STRIKE?
>> FIRST OFF, WE DON'T KNOW THAT
THEY'RE TERRORISTS.
>> Stephen:  YEAH, BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH
ANYTHING, AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE INNOCENT.
THEM WE'D HAVE TO LET THEM GO,
AND THEY COULD ATTACK US FOR
HOLDING THEM WITHOUT CAUSE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, UNDER
THAT LOGIC, WE CAN DO AWAY WITH
THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.
>> Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR, BUT GO
AHEAD.
>> WELL IN THE HEART LAND OF
WHAT WE DO AS A NATION IS
SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION.
WE'RE DEDICATED AS A COUNTRY
THAT IS DEDICATED TO THE RULE OF
LAW, AND THE IDEA OF HOLDING
SOMEBODY WITHOUT EVER HAVING A
TRIAL, CALLING THEM A TERRORIST
BUT NEVER GIVING THEM AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR
INNOCENCE IS SIMPLY
ANTI-AMERICAN.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, BUT, WE--
WE WENT THROUGH ALL OF THIS
YEARS AGO WHEN GITMO WAS SET UP.
WE HAD ALL THESE ARGUMENTS, YOU
KNOW, 10, 12 YEARS AGO.
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR
12 YEARS.
THEY'RE ALMOST READY TO HAVE
THEIR BEHIND-BARS MITZVAH.
WE DID ALL THIS, OKAY.
WE SETTLED IT.
WE SETTLED THAT GITMO CAN EXIST
AND THOSE PEOPLE MUST BE KEPT
THERE.
>> ACTUALLY, WE DIDN'T SETTLE
ANY OF THAT.
>> Stephen:  I DID.
>> WELL, YES, CONGRESS IN 2008
AFTER HAVING LET PRESIDENT BUSH
RELEASE 600 DETAINEES WITHOUT A
SINGLE COMMENT --
>> Stephen:  16% OF WHICH WENT
BACK TO TERROR.
>> ACTUALLY, IN THE-- NOT 16%.
IT'S CLOSER TO ABOUT 3% WERE
ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN ANYTHING,
UNLESS YOU SAY THAT WRITING AN
OP-ED IS TERRORIZING.
>> Stephen:  IT IS.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen:  HAVE YOU READ THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" OPINION PAGE?
LAUGH OKAY.
>> I SEE YOUR POINT.
>> Stephen:  OKAY, GO AHEAD.
>> THE REASON THEY'RE THERE
ISN'T BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'VE
DONE, BECAUSE OF THE THREAT THEY
POSE, BUT BECAUSE CONGRESS VIEWS
THEM AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL TO
KICK AROUND, WHICH DOESN'T MAKE
US SAFER.
IN THE END-- AND THINK ABOUT IT
THIS WAY.
IF YOU HAD A RELATIVE SOMEWHERE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND EVERYONE
HAD SAID THEY POSE NODE THREAT
TO THE COUNTRY.
THEY'D DONE NOTHING WRONG, AND
WE'RE GOING TO RETHESE THEM,
EXCEPT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
DECIDED NOT TO FUND THEIR
RELEASE, WOULD YOU BE ANGRY
ENOUGH TO BOMB THAT COUNTRY?
>> Stephen:  I THINK WE HAVE
BOMBED MOST OF THOSE COUNTRIES
ALREADY.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER-- HOMELAND
ON ONE SECOND, SIR.
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES
SWIFT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
