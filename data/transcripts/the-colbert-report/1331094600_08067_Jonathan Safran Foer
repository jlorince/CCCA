HELLO.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK
FOR PASSOVER.
I HAVE FOUR QUESTIONS FOR HIM.
PLEASE WELCOME, JONATHAN SAFRAN
FOER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU'VE BEEN ON
THE SHOW BEFORE.
YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF EXTREMELY
LOUD AND INCREDIBLEIBLY CLOSE.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: EVERYTHING IS ILL
LUMINATED.
NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN US THE NEW
AMERICAN HAGGADAH.
ALL RIGHT?
I OBVIOUSLY KNOW WHAT THIS IS
AND WHAT IT MEANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT FOR THOSE FEW MEMBERS OF MY
AUDIENCE WHO ARE NOT JEWISH,
WHAT IS THIS AND WHAT ZIT MEAN?
>> VERY FEW PROBABLY.
BUT THE HAGGADAH IS THE USERS
MANUAL FOR THE MOST WIDELY
CELEBRATED JEWISH HOLIDAY
PASSOVER WHICH IS THE ANNUAL
RETELLING OF EXODUS FROM EGYPT,
ONE OF THE OLDEST CONTINUALLY
TOLD STORIES.
>> STEPHEN: SOMETHING TO DO
WITH PASSOVER WHICH IS WHY WE
HAVE AN EXTRA CHAIR FOR ELIJAH.
>> USUALLY A GLASS OF WIN, TOO.
>> STEPHEN: THERE YOU GO.
IT'S ACTUALLY MARGARITA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T TELL HIM HOW I MADE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO THIS STORY -- DIDN'T THIS
STORY ALREADY EXIST?
IT'S CALLED EXODUS.
>> YEAH IT'S --
>> STEPHEN: SO YOU THINK YOU
CAN IMPROVE ON MOSESS.
YOU'VE GOT SOME MATSA BALLS,
BODY.
THIS IS THE ONE REVISE THE MOST
TIMES.
7,000 EDITIONS OF IT THAT HAVE
BEEN CREATED.
WHEREVER THERE ARE JEWS THERE
ARE NEW HAGGADAHS.
>> STEPHEN: EVERY SINGLE
GENERATION THERE'S A NEW JEW WHO
SAYS I COULD DO BETTER.
IT'S NOT BAD DON'T GET ME WRONG.
>> IT'S TUNING THE INSTRUMENT.
>> STEPHEN: HOW DO YOU TUNE
IT?
THE STORY GOES THE ISRAELITES
ARE ENSLAVED BY PHARAOH, RIGHT?
WHO IS FORCING THEM TO PROVIDE
CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE?
>> YES, THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND
THE JEWS GROANED AND GOD HEARD
THE GROANING AND GOD CAME DOWN
AND, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THE CORSE
NARRATIVE THAT INCLUDES TEN
PLAGUES MOST -- TEN PLAYS WHICH
MOST ARE FAMILIAR WITH.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT IS YOUR
FAVORITE PLAGUE.
>> FROGS LOCUSTS.
>> Stephen: IT'S LESS OF A
PLAGUE AND MORE LIKE A GIFT.
LOOK, FROGS.
IT DOESN'T SAY THE FROGS
DEVOURED THEIR EYES.
>> I TAKE MY KIDS TO AQUARIUMS
SO --
>> STEPHEN: EXACTLY.
SO EVERY JEWISH FAMILY HAS ONE
OF THESE?
>> WHAT YOU DO IT IS TRY TOLL
MAKE IT FELT INSTEAD OF READ.
WE HAVE A NEW TRANSLATION BY
NATHAN ENGLANDER WHICH IS MORE
ACCESSIBLE, MORE CLEAR, MORE
ENGAGING THAN ANY OTHER
HAGGADAH.
WE HAVE COMMENTARIES ARE JEFFREY
GOLDBERG.
>> STEPHEN: THAT MAKES SENSE
BECAUSE EXODUS SAY SERIES OF
UNFORTUNATE EVENTS.
>> THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT
TITLE FOR THE BOOK.
>> STEPHEN: IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN.
WHAT DREW TO IT.
YOU TELL ORIGINAL STORIES BUT IT
MIGHT THE LEAST ORIGINAL STORISM
IT'S IN THE A SLAM BUT WHY TIE
YOURSELF TO A NARRATIVE SOMEONE
ELSE HAS ESTABLISHED.
>> THE ANSWER WAS IN THE
QUESTION.
IT'S THE AT LEAST ORIGINAL
STORY.
IT'S VERY FAMILIAR.
IT'S BEEN TOLD BY MORE THAN 100
AGAIN RAGES OF JEWS.
IT'S ONE OF MOST WIDELY
RECOGNIZED STORIES ACROSS
CULTURES.
IT'S BEEN BORROWED BY SOCIAL
JUSTICE MOVEMENTS.
IT TELLS US TO EXPERIENCE THE
RETELLING TORQUE BE CHARACTERS
INSIDE SORTIE RATHER THAN JUST
SIT BACK AND RECEIVE IT.
TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO CREATE A
DOCUMENTING THAT IS ENGAGE,
CONFRONTATIONAL, PROVOCATIVE.
>> STEPHEN: DOES EVERYBODY
READ IT TOGETHER?
>> PEOPLE DO IT DIFFERENTLY.
IDEALLY THE PARENTS SIT DOWN FOR
A MEAL.
IN MY CASE IT WAS PARENTS,
GRANDPARENTS, COUSINS, TEACHERS,
PEOPLE WANDERING THROUGH TOWN.
WE WOULD MOVE FROM THE BEGINNING
TO THE BOOK TO THE END SOMETIMES
SKIPPING LARGE SECTIONS.
>> STEPHEN: I UNDERSTAND
FAMILY HAS PEOPLE OVER.
YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT COPY
FOR EVERYONE.
EVERYONE GETS THEIR OWN COPY OF
HAGGADAH WHO IS THERE FOR THE
MEAL.
>> THIS IS TRUE.
>> STEPHEN: CHA-CHING, SNRIET
ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE WORLD POPULATION OF JEWS
FALLS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR
OF THE CHINESE CENSUS.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT
MANY PEOPLE.
A KORAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SO.
>> STEPHEN: HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT REWRITING THE KORAN?
>> THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW.
>> STEPHEN: NOT IF YOU REWRITE
THE KORAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
JONATHAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.
