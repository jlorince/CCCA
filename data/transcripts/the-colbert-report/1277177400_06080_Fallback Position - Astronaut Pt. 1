NATION, IN THIS ECONOMY, NO JOB
IS SAFE, NOT EVEN MINE.
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE AGREED TO
TEACH THAT LEARN HOW TO HOST
"THE COLBERT REPORT" CLASS AT
THE LEARNING ANNEX.
THIS PUNDIT JOB FALLS THROUGH,
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER JOB
THAT'S LESS IMPORTANT, LIKE
ASTRONAUT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THE WINDOW ON THAT CAREER
CHOICE IS CLOSING FASTER THAN MY
OTHER BACK-UP, GERBER BABY
MODEL.
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, I CAN'T PLAY 16 MONTHS
FOREVER.
NASA HAS ONLY TWO MANNED
MISSIONS LEFT BEFORE THE SHUTTLE
FLEET IS RETIRED SO THERE IS NO
TIME TO WASTE.
THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FALLBACK POSITION.
[LAUGHTER]
♪ HALLELUJAH ♪♪
I HEADED TO NASA HEADQUARTERS AT
THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER IN
HOUSTON, TEXAS, TO BECOME AN
ASTRONAUT.
FIRST I SAT DOWN WITH THE
COMMANDER OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE
"DISCOVERY," STEVE LINDSAY.
COMMANDER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
>> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU THE
GUY TO MAKE ME AN ASTRONAUT?
>> WELL, I HAVE A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE.
I'VE FLOWN FOUR SPACE SHUTTLE
MISSIONS.
>> Stephen: WHAT'S THE MOON
LIKE?
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE MOON.
>> Stephen: CAN I GET ONE OF
THOSE MOON GUYS?
THEY'RE HOW OLD?
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T GET A MOON
GUY, I'LL TAKE THIS GUY.
GO AHEAD.
>> I WAS THE CHIEF OF THE
ASTRONAUT OFFICE FOR OVER THREE
YEARS.
>> Stephen: YOU REALLY BELIEVE
IN MANNED SPACE FLIGHTS?
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO?
>> Stephen: WHY?
>> WHEN YOU GO AFTER A DIFFICULT
OBJECTIVE, LIKE BUILDING THE
SPACE STATION...
>> Stephen: HOW DIFFICULT IS
THAT?
>> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
>> Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THAT
IS HYPE, BUILDING A SPACE
STATION, ORBITING THE EARTH.
>> NONE OF THAT IS HYPE.
IT MAY LOOK EASY...
>> Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE
SNAPPING TOGETHER LEGOS, BIG
LEGO, SPACE LEGOS, BUT STILL...
>> THE MOST ELEGANT ENGINEERING
SOLUTIONS ARE THE SIMPLEST.
>>
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE
QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND:
HAVE YOU EVER DONE IT AT ZERO G?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU HAD, WOULD YOU TELL ME?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
SO I CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT YOU
HAVE.
>> YOU CAN ASSUME NOTHING.
>> Stephen: NASA HAS TO HAVE
TRIED, RIGHT?
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: IT HAS TO HAVE
HAPPENED.
>> .
NO
>> Stephen: IT HAPPENED.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: JUST SAY IT
HAPPENED.
>> LET'S NOT.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE I'VE DONE
AN INFORMAL POLL OF WHAT SOME
PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT.
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING RESULT.
THE FIRST ONE IS THEY WANT TO
KNOW HOW YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM.
HOW DO YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM.
>> WE HAVE A COMPLEX SPACE
TOILET.
WE TURN ON A FAN THAT'S
ESSENTIALLY A VACUUM.
WE HAVE TRAINER WITH A CAMERA SO
YOU CAN LINE YOURSELF UP
PROPERLY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TELL IN
ZERO GRAVITY.
>> Stephen: IS THAT A LIVE
INTERNET WEB FEED?
>> IT IS, IT IS.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE GOING TO
THE BATHROOM?
>> NASA.GOV.
>> OF PEOPLE GOING TO THE
BATHROOM?
>> NO, JUST THE TRAINER.
>> Stephen: YOU'LL PUT THAT
ONLINE BUT YOU WON'T ANSWER THE
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU
HAVE SEX IN SPACE?
>> I'M NOT PUTTING ANYTHING ON
LINE.
IT'S NOT MY JOB.
>> Stephen: NOT YOUR JOB.
HAVE YOU EVER GONE TO THE
BATHROOM ON THE INTERNET?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: AND HOW DO YOU
HAVE SEX IN SPACE?
>> VERY CAREFULLY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I'M A HUGE
BELIEVER IN THE SPACE PROGRAM.
I'M A BELIEVER IN PUTTING MEN
INTO SPACE.
KIDS DON'T LOOK UP TO ROBOTS.
NO KID FOLLOWS AROUND THEIR
ROOMBA IN THEIR HOUSE AND SAYS,
I WANT TO BE A VACUUM CLEANER
WHEN I GROW UP.
NO, THEY FOLLOW AROUND A PERSON.
THEY SAY, I WANT TO BE A FLOOR
CLEANER WHEN I GROW UP, SAME
THING FOR ASTRONAUTS.
THEY WANT TO FOLLOW MAN INTO
SPACE, NOT A ROBOT.
YEA OR NAY, SIR?
HOW SAY YOU?
>> I THINK WE'RE MORE MOTIVATED
BY PEOPLE GOING INTO SPACE THAN
ROBOTS GOING INTO SPACE.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
>> ROBOTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT
ROLE, BUT SO DO PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE ROBOTS
CAN'T HAVE SEX IN SPACE.
>> I'M IN THE SURE ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE JAPANESE ARE PROBABLY
ALREADY WORKING ON THAT.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
NOT INVOLVED IN ROBOTIC SPACE
EXPLORATION THANKFULLY.
BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT YOU'RE
INTERVIEWING US.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> WE NEED TO LEARN ABOUT YOU.
>> Stephen: FIRE, FIRE.
>> FIRST QUESTION, REAL EASY
ONE.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE AN
ASTRONAUT?
>> Stephen: OBVIOUSLY THE
JUMPSUITS ARE A BIG PART OF THE
DRAW.
YOU KNOW, I FIND THEY'RE VERY
SLENDERIZING.
ORANGE IS MY COLOR.
>> OKAY.
WELL, YOU'RE HERE OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S DEBATABLE WHETHER I'M AN
AMERICAN HERO.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
I GOT TO SAY, THAT'S PART OF THE
DRAW.
YOU CAN JUST SAY, YOU CAN HAVE
CARDS PRINTED UP TO SAY, STEPHEN
COLBERT, AMERICAN HERO.
>> SO THAT'S WHAT YOUR CARD
WOULD SAY?
>> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S WHAT
MY CARD DOES SAY.
IT ALREADY SAYS "ASTRONAUT," TOO
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO MAKE IT
OFFICIAL.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
NEXT QUESTION, GO.
>> WE'RE INTERVIEWING FOR A LONG
DURATION MISSION, SIX MONTHS ON
THE SPACE STATION.
WE'RE THINKING YOU'LL BE UP
THERE WITH SIX OTHER
INTERNATIONAL ASTRONAUTS
ESSENTIALLY LOCKED IN A
WINNEBAGO-SIZED SPACE FOR SICK
MONTHS AT A TIME.
WITH YOUR PERSONALITY, WE NEED
TO KNOW YOU CAN WORK AS PART OF
THAT TEAM.
>> Stephen: I TEND TO LASH OUT
IN LOW GRAVITY.
I HAVE SPASTIC COLON.
I NEED A LOT OF TIME ALONE.
I NEED A LOT OF TIME ALONE.
>> ALONE
>> Stephen: YOU KNOW, "ALONE."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
>> WELL, DO YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL
QUARTERS UP THERE, BUT THEY'RE
VERY SMALL.
>> Stephen: HOW SMALL?
>> ABOUT AS WIDE AS THE CHAIR
YOU'RE SITTING IN.
>> Stephen: SO A SPACE COFFIN.
IS THERE A LARGER ROOM WE CAN DO
THIS IN?
THIS ROOM IS TOO SMALL FOR ME.
>> STEPHEN, BACK TO THE
INTERVIEW.
>> Stephen: SORRY.
I HAVE A FEAR OF TUBES AND
WIRING.
>> TUBES AND WIRING.
OKAY.
>> Stephen: AND I'M NOT GOOD
WITH HEIGHT.
>> YOU'RE NOT GOOD WITH HEIGHT.
>> Stephen: OR FOLLOWING
ORDERS.
>> FOLLOWING ORDERS.
>> Stephen: I'M MORE OF A FREE
SPIRIT.
>> SO IF YOU WENT UP, YOU'D NEED
TO BE THE COMMANDER.
>>
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
I KNOW YOU'RE A COMMANDER, BUT I
HAVE PATCH THAT SAYS I'M
COMMANDER: IT'S NOT A CONTEST,
BUT YOU'RE NOT WINNING.
>> I DIDN'T START AS A
COMMANDER.
>> Stephen: I DID, SO I COULD
BE FIELD MARSHAL BY THE TIME WE
GET UP THERE.
>> FIELD MARSHAL.
ONE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU,
BECAUSE WE HIRE YOU TO BE AN
LAST NOT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'LL NECESSARILY GIVE YOU AN
OPPORTUNITY TO FLY IN SPACE.
ARE YOU WILLING TO COME HERE ON
THE CHANCE THAT YOU MAY NEVER
NIGH TO SPACE.
>> Stephen: AS LONG AS YOU AND
I KNOW.
>> OKAY.
STEEP STOOP DID I DO THAT RIGHT
BY THE WAY?
>> THAT WAS...
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT'S NEXT?
>> I HAVE SOME ASTRONAUT LINED
UP TO GIVE YOU SOME SPECIFIC
TRAINING.
WHY DON'T WE WALK OUT AND MEET
THEM RIGHT NOW.
>> Stephen: LET'S DO IT.
FINALLY, IT WAS TIME TO REALLY
BEGIN MY TRAINING.
READY.
>> YOU CAN MOVE A LITTLE BIT
FASTER.
>> Stephen: GETTING READY.
>> OKAY.
>> Stephen: JOIN US TOMORROW
WHEN I CONTINUE MY TRAINING IN
PART TWO OF "STEPHEN COLBERT'S
FALLBACK POSITION: ASTRONAUT."
JIMMY, LET'S GIVE 'EM TASTE.
UM, HAVE YOU HAD SEX IN SPACE?
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE SEX IN
SPACE?
WHAT'S SEX LIKE IN SPACE?
>> IT'S NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM.
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
>> WE ARE SO BUSY.
>> YES.
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE JUST TOO
BUSY TO HAVE SEX IN SPACE?
WOULD YOU TELL ME?
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT.
>> Stephen: NO ONE IN NASA
SEEMS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT.
>> WE HAVE NOT PLANNED FOR THAT
PARTICULAR EVENT.
>> Stephen: NOBODY DOES.
WHEN YOU DON'T PLAN FOR SEX, IT
