MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACCLAIMED
DIRECTOR OF STAGE AND SCREEN
WHOSE NEW FILM IS "THE TEMPEST."
JIM.
>> MUTINOUS WINDS.
THE GREEN SEA AND THE AZURE
ROARING WALL AND THELING THUNDER
HAVE I GIVEN FIRE.
AND BY THE SPURS KNOCKED OFF THE
PINE AND CEDAR, MY COMMAND HAS
WOKE THEM UP.
[INAUDIBLE]
>> Stephen: THAT'S HOW I LIKE
MY SHAKESPEARE, ON FIRE.
PLEASE WELCOME JULIE TAYMOR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MS. TAYMOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DON'T EVEN PRETEND TO GET UP.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: I AM A BIG FAN OF
YOUR WORK.
I LOVE SPECTACLE.
YOU DAZZLED THE AUDIENCE WITH
MORE THAN THEY COULD POSSIBLY
EXPECT.
I MEAN, JUST THERE, SHAKESPEARE,
YOU EXPECT SOME GUY JUST
WHEEZING OUT.
THAT THING'S GOT EXPLOSIONS.
WHY "THE TEMPEST," WHY NOW?
>> I THINK "THE TEMPEST" IS 400
YEARS OLD THIS YEAR.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S FRESH.
>> IT'S VERY FRESH.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S FOREVER CONTEMPORARY AS
THEY SAY ABOUT SHAKESPEARE.
>> Stephen: HOW SO?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> IT'S ABOUT THE ABUSE OF
POWER.
>> Stephen: IS IT IT REALLY?
IT'S ABOUT AN OLD WIZARD TRAPPED
ON AN ISLAND.
IT'S LIKE "LOST" MEETS "HARRY
POTTER."
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: AM I A SHAKESPEARE
SCHOLAR AND I DON'T KNOW IT?
>> IT DOES HAVE THE MAGIC.
>> Stephen: WHY A LADY IN THAT
PART.
I'M A SHAKESPEARE ORIGINALIST.
IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A LADY IN
A SHAKESPEARE PLAY, IT SHOULD BE
PLAYED BY HAIRLESS YOUNG BOY.
>> THAT'S TRUE, AND ALWAYS ALL
THE WOMEN WERE PLAYED BY
HAIRLESS YOUNG BOYS.
>> Stephen: ARE YOU TELLING US
MIRREN IS ACTUALLY HAIRLESS
YOUNG BOY?
BECAUSE SHE HAS FOOLED A LOT OF
MEN.
>> DEFINITELY.
NO, NO, I THINK HELEN HAS THE
POWER AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
TO PLAY THE WIZARD.
AND IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY
WITCHCRAFT WAS A VERY COMMON
ACCUSATION OF WOMEN.
AND SO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THIS
INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
WOMAN WHO HAS STUDIED ALCHEMY,
WHO HAS STUDIED WHITE MAGIC, AND
NOW ON THIS ISLAND BECAUSE SHE
WANTS TO SEEK REVENGE FOR WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO HER, SHE'S BEEN
ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT, SHE
ALLOWS HER POWER TO GO TO A VERY
DARK PLACE AND IT MOVES OVER
INTO AN ABUSE OF POWER.
>> Stephen: IT IS "LOST" MEETS
"HARRY POTTER."
>> THERE HAS TO BE A MOVIE WHY
I'D DO A MOVIE LIKE THIS NOW.
THERE IS AN ATTRACTION TO THESE
THEMES.
>> Stephen: SHE HAS A
DAUGHTER.
>> NOTHING SLIPS BY HELEN.
>> Stephen: HOW DOES THAT
RELATIONSHIP CHANGE BETWEEN A
FERRES AND A DAUGHTER AND A
MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER?
>> A FATHER AND A DAUGHTER HAS A
BATTLE WHEN A YOUNG MAN COMES
IN.
HE REALLY BATTLES THAT YOUNG GUY
WHO COMES TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER
AWAY.
A MOTHER IS VERY DIFFERENT.
MOTHER LOVE, SHE KNOWS WHAT HER
DAUGHTER IS GOING TO GET INTO,
SO THE NEED TO PROTECT HER
DAUGHTER FROM THIS YOUNG BOY IS
A VERY, VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF
EXPERIENCE FOR THE AUDIENCE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU UPDATE THE
LANGUAGE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD
UNDERSTAND IT?
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH
SHAKESPEARE IS THAT IF YOU'RE
THE GREATEST WRITER IN ENGLAND
EVER PRODUCED.
SPEAK-A THE ENGLISH.
YOU DON'T SAY THOU, SAY YOU.
SAY PRAYER, DON'T SAY ZUNE.
SAY HOLY [BLEEPED].
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, THE WORD
[BLEEPED] IS AN ELIZABETHAN
WORD.
>> Stephen: WHAT?
>> THE WORD [BLEEPED] IS AN
ELIZABETHAN WORD.
>> Stephen: IT'S KIND OF
CLASSY.
>> VERY CLASSY.
THERE'S A LINE THE SLAVE SAYS,
HE SAYS, "YOU TAUGHT MELANGE WAJ
AND MY PROFIT ON IT IS I KNOW
HOW THE CURSE.
THE RED PLAYING RID YOU FROM
LEARNING ME YOUR LANGUAGE AND HE
POUNDS HIS BELLY AND ALL OVER
HIS BODY ARE ELIZABETHAN CURSE
WORDS, SHAKESPEAREAN CURSE
WORDS.
>> Stephen: WOW.
>> THIS JUST WENT OFF.
>> Stephen: DID YOUR MIC JUST
DIE?
>> NO.
YES.
I'M BACK.
>> Stephen: WE CALL THAT
WITCHCRAFT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, YOU'RE ALSO DIRECTING
SPIDER-MAN THE MUSICAL.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Stephen: ANY RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN SPIDER-MAN AND
SHAKESPEARE?
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: HEAR IT.
SPIN YOUR WEB.
>> ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE BOTH
INCREDIBLE POP ICONS.
SHAKESPEARE WAS THE MOST POPULAR
WRITER OF HIS DAY AND HE'S
PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR
SCREENWRITER OF ALL TIME.
WE'VE HAD AT LEAST 700 MOVIES
MADE OF HIS WORK.
>> Stephen: HE MUST BE LOADED.
>> HE'S LOADED.
>> Stephen: IS THERE A
SHAKESPEAREAN CHARACTER WHO
WOULD MAKE A GOOD SUPERHERO?
I MEAN, COULD HAMLET FIGHT CRIME
WITH HIS GHOST DAD?
>> THERE IS A COMIC BOOK SERIES
OUT NOW CALLED KILL SHAKESPEARE,
LIKE KILL BILL.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> THERE.
IS IT'S IN CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH,
SO I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S MOSTLY
GRAPHIC.
SO IT'S MOSTLY VISUAL.
BUT THEY TAKE HAMLET AND
McBATH AND OTHELLO AND THEY
HAVE THEM SEARCHING TO FIND
SHAKESPEARE BECAUSE HE SCREWED
UP THEIR LIVES.
SO THERE IS... THEY'RE OUT THERE
ON A MISSION.
THAT'S REALLY A CONTEMPORARY
COMIC BOOK THAT'S JUST COME OUT.
>> Stephen: MAKE THAT MOVIE.
COME ON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
>> Stephen: JULIE TAYMOR.
