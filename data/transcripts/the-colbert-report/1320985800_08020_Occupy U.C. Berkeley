(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
PLEASE, WELCOME.
NATION, WE ALL KNOW THE
OCCUPY WALL STREET
PROTESTORS ARE DANGEROUS.
THEY'RE BEATING ON DRUMS NOW
BUT SOON IT WILL BE LLOYD
BLOONING FEIN'S SKULL THIS
CANCER ON CAPITALISM HAS
SPREAD TO EVERY CORNER OF
THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING,
NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, HIPPIE
HAVEN UC BERKELEY WHERE THIS
WEEK STUDENTS STAGE PRODUCT
TESTS AGAINST BANKS.
AND DRAS PARTICULAR
STATEWIDE CUTS IN EDUCATION
SPENDING.
THE UNIVERSITY SAID
PROTESTORS COULD STAY AND
THE PLAZA UP TO A WEEK AS
LONG AS THEY DID NOT PITCH
TENTS.
COME ON.
SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE 18.
THEY CAN'T GOTO HOURS
WITHOUT PITCHING A TENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO
WATCHES THIS SHOW IN THE
PAST I'VE HAD SOME HARSH
WORDS FOR THIS SLOW-PA
CHULLY SUPERFUND GRANOLA
DUMP SITE.
BUT TONIGHT I AM CHANGING MY
TUNE BECAUSE YESTERDAY
BERKELEY UNIVERSITY
OFFICIALS DID THE RIGHT
THING.
THEY TOLD THE STUDENTS TO
LEAVE.
AND FOR SOME REASON, THESE
FREE THINKING BERKELEY
STUDENTS DID NOT OBEY
AUTHORITY.
SO THE UNIVERSITY CALLED IN
A TEAM OF SKILLED CRISIS
MANAGERS TO DIFFUSE THE
SITUATION WITH A RAP
SESSION.
JIM?
>> WOW.
LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE REALLY
MAKING SOME BREAKTHROUGHS
THERE.
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY SAY
BERKELEY IS CRUNCHIE I
DIDN'T REALIZE THEY MEANT
THE STUDENTS' RIB CAGES.
AND SPEARING A SMALL ASIAN
GIRL IN THE SPLEEN FIRST
SHOWS BERKELEY'S ADMIRABLE
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITIES.
OF COURSE IT'S NO SURPRISE
THIS IS ALL PART OF THE
BERKELEY TRADITION.
THE UNIVERSITY WEB SITE
PROUDLY ADVERTISES ITS
HISTORY OF ACTIVISM AND
INSTRUCTING HOW TO PROTEST
SAFELY.
SO I'M SURE THOSE BILLY
CLUBS WERE WEARING CON
DUMBS.
BUT I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA DID NOT
BLOW THIS OUT OF THE
PROPORTION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DESCRIBED OFFICERS PULLING
PEOPLE FROM THE STEPS AND
NUDGING OTHERS WITH BATONS.
YES, NUDGING.
JUST LIKE THE RODNY KING
NUDGING OR WHEN CONNER SET
UP THAT SLIP AND SLIDE IN
BIRMINGHAM.
FOLKS, I THINK THESE KIDS
SHOULD BE THANKING THE
POLICE AND UNIVERSITY
OFFICIALS.
BECAUSE EVERYONE CRITICIZES
THE OCCUPY MOVEMENT BECAUSE
THEIR MESSAGE IS TOO VAGUE.
WELL AT LEAST NEXT TIME
THESE KIDS WILL HAVE
SOMETHING CONCRETE TO
PROTEST ABOUT.
BUT REMEMBER, PLEASE,
PROTEST SAFELY, KIDS.
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW
MUCH MORE NUDGI
