BROKE THE ARMSTRONG KEATINGSCANDAL.
BIG DEAL PLEASE WELCOME REEDALBERED GOTTI, AND VANESSA
O'CONNELL.
LET'S GET YOUR BONA FIDES OUTHERE.
REED AND VANESSA YOU BOTH WORKFOR THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"
CORRECT?
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen:  YOU COVER WHITECOLLAR CRIME?
>> CORRECT.
>> Stephen:  AND YOU COVER-->> I'VE BEEN COVERING VICES LIKE
TOBACCO, ALCOHOL.
>> Stephen:  SO TOGETHER WHITECOLLAR CRIME AND DOPE EQUALS
LANCE ARMSTRONG.
BECAUSE YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED"WHEELED MEN:  LANCE ARMSTRONG
THE TOUR DE FRANCE AND THEGREATEST SPORTS CONSPIRACY
EVER."
FIRST OF ALL, LANCE IS AFRIEND.
>> I KNOW THAT.
>> Stephen:  I STICK BY MYFRIEND.
I'M LOYAL TO THE END.
MY FIRST QUESTION IS, DO PEOPLESTILL LIKE HIM?
DO PEOPLE STILL LIKE LANCE?
HOW IS HIS POPULARITY DOING?
>> NOT STOW GREAT.
>> Stephen:  WHAT DOES DLANCEDO THAT WAS SO BAD?
HONEST TO GOD.
IT'S JUST A BICYCLE RACE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WHAT LITTLEKIDS DO WITH BELLS AND
STREAMERS.
WHY ARE WE HOLDING HIS FEET TOTHE FIRE OVER THIS?
IT'S NOT THE TOUR DU AMERICA.
IT'S THE TOUR DE FRANCE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
WHY?
HE FOOLED SOME FRENCH PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER )>> IT'S REALLY NOT JUST ABOUT
CHEATING IN CYCLING.
CHEATING IN SPORTS, YOU'RERIGHT, IT'S NOT A CRIME IN THE
U.S.
BUT WHAT THIS BOOK IS REALLYABOUT IS THE WHOLE CONSPIRACY
AROUND COVERING UP FOR THECHEATING IN THAT RACE.
AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SORT OFTOLD THE TRUTH OVER THE YEARS
AND WHO WERE CONFRONTED WITHLAWSUIT, THREATS FROM LANCE AND
THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM.
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY THESTORY.
>> Stephen:  SO WHAT DID HEDO?
HOW DID HE GET AWAY WITH THIS.
HE WON SEVEN TIMES.
HOW DO YOU NOT GET CAUGHT WHILEYOU'RE DOING IT BUT GET CAUGHT
YEARS LATER.
>> THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND SOAMAZING ABOUT THE STORY.
THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAMEOUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, AND SOMEHOW
THIS THING KEPT SECRET, AND HEALMOST GOT AWAY WITH IT.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR A BUNCH OFCOINCIDENCES AT THE VERY END, I
MEAN, HE WOULD HAVE-- WE NEVERWOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT ALL OF
THIS.
>> Stephen:  WHAT WAS HEACTUALLY DOING TO HIS BODY.
THIS RACE THSH TOUR DE FRANCE,ONE THING I'LL SAY IS IT SEEMS
IMPOSSIBLE.
HONEST TO GOD, IT'S DAYS IN AROW GOING UP HILL AND DOWN HILL
IN THE PYRENEES, THINGS THATWOULD CRUSH A NON-DOPED HUMAN.
WHAT WAS HE DOING?
HOW WAS HE SUPER CHARGESHIMSELF?
>> IT EVOLVED.
IT STARTED OUT WITH HUMAN GROWTHHORMONE AND TESTOSTERONE.
>> Stephen:  I HEARD THAT'SDELICIOUS.
HE WAS ON THE T-GEL GEL?
>> WELL, GEL OR PATCH AND THISEVOSMED INTO HIGHER OCTANE TYPE
OF DOPING, E.P.O., EDGAR ALLENPOE IS A BLOOD-BOOSTING DRUG.
THAT WAS THE 96 NAME OR LANCEARMSTRONG CALLED IT BUTTER AS A
CODE NAME.
>> HE KEPT IT IN THE BUTTERCOMPARTMENT IN THE
REFRIGERATOR.
>> Stephen:  AND WHEN THEYCAUGHT HIM THEY SAID, "I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS IS NOT BUTTER."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WAIT A SECOND.
SO, BUT, OKAY, SO WHAT-- YOURINITIAL REPORTING ON THIS WAS
WHEN?
>> WE STARTED REPORTING ON ITREALLY TOGETHER BACK IN 2010
WHEN WE BROKE THE STORY OF FLOYDLANDIS, HIS FORMER TEAMMATE --
>> Stephen:  WHO IS THE GUYWHO WON AFTER HIM?
>> CORRECT.
AND HE TESTED POSITIVELY AFTERTHAT.
>> Stephen:  AND FLOYD LARKEDON LANCE.
NOBODY LIKES A SQUEALER.
WHAT DID HE DO WHEN HE NARCED ONHIM.
>> HE CALLED HIM A LIAR.
HE HAD A POINT.
HE DENIED USE PERFORMANCEENHANCING DRUG.
>> IF HE HAD BEEN NICER TOFLOYD, THIS MIGHT NEVER HAVE
COME OUT.
BUT HE WAS A JERK TO FLOYD, ANDAS A RESULT --
>> Stephen:  PAYBACK IS ABITCH.
>> Stephen:  HE OWES THEPOSTAL SERVICE-- WHO WAS A
SPONSOR-- LONG GREEN.
>> THE POSTAL SERVICE PAID $40MILLION OVER THE YEARS TO HIS
CYCLING TEAM AND NOW HE'S BEINGSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE IN A WHISTLEBLOWERLAWSUIT THAT COULD END IN TRIPLE
THAT.
SO 120 MILLION.
>> Stephen:  WOW, WOW.
I'M GLAD THEY'RE GOING AFTERLANCE INSTEAD OF THE HEADS OF
ANY OF THE BANKS ON WALLSTREET.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THIS IS WHERE THE REAL WHITECOLLAR CRIME IS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGME.
