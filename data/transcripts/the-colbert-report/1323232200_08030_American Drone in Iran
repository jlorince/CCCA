>> Stephen: THANK YOU!
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," IN HERE
OUT THERE, AROUND THE WORLD.
(CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
FOLKS... THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU
DID NOT HAVE TO CHANT MY NAME!
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T, I WOULD HAVE
HAD TO START THE SHOW OVER.
(LAUGHTER)
SOMETHING I'M SURE NONE OF US
WANT TO GO THROUGH.
(LAUGHTER)
NATION...
(LAUGHTER)
DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS TO
IGNORE THEM, THINGS ARE
HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE
WORLD.
FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S AMERICA'S
EVER-ESCALATING TENSIONS WITH
IRAN THAT COULD LEAD TO YET
ANOTHER WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
AND THERE'S BAD NEWS, TOO.
JIM?
>> IRAN CLAIMS IT HAS CAPTURED
ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST
SOPHISTICATED SPY PLANES.
>> THE SECRET STEALTH DRONE--
NICKNAMED THE BEAST OF
KANDAHAR-- IS ONE OF AMERICA'S
MOST SOPHISTICATED INTELLIGENCE
TOOLS.
>> Stephen: NOT THE BEAST OF
KANDAHAR!
(LAUGHTER)
FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE
PREVIOUS BEAST OF KANDAHAR, A
GOAT.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THIS IS DANGEROUS!
OUR COOL REMOTE-CONTROL PLANE
WENT OVER THE FENCE AND CRASHED
IN IRAN'S BACKYARD!
AND YOU KNOW OLD MR. AHMA-"YOU
KIDS STAY OFF MY LAWN"-IJAD IS
NEVER GOING TO GIVE IT BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT THING IS EXPENSIVE!
I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
PLAYING WITH IN THE THAT VACANT
LOT.
NOW, FOLKS, SOMEONE IS GOING TO
HAVE TO GO GET IT BACK.
WELL, ONCE AGAIN, I GUESS IT HAS
TO BE ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MR. AHMA-"DID ANYONE EVER TELL
YOU YOU LOOK LIKE JAKE
GYLLENHAAL"-IJAD?
WE'RE REALLY OR ABOUT OUR DRONE
LANDING IN YOUR YARD, SIR, AND
ABOUT THOSE TIMES WE T.P.'D YOUR
SANCTIONS.
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE US HANGING
OUT WITH THOSE JEWISH KIDS BUT
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
THEY'RE OUR STRATEGIC PLAY DATE
IN THE REGION.
ANYWAY, IF YOU COULD GIVE US OUR
DRONE BACK WE PROMISE NEVER TO
EVER EVER BOTHER YOU EVER AGAIN,
OKAY?
AND IF YOU DO I SWEARLY COME
OVER HERE EVERY WEEKEND AND MOW
YOUR SAND.
(LAUGHTER)
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE WORK.
THAT'S THE WORK.
(APPLAUSE)
OKAY?
OH, OH, AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
CAN WE GET THE HOSTAGES BACK,
PLEASE?
COME ON!
IT'S DAY
