MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME BACK.
FOLKS, ANYBODY KNOWS ME KNOWS
I'M NOT FAN OF FRUIT.
I SAY, IF YOU CAN'T FIND A PRIZE
INSIDE OF IT, IT'S NOT WORTH
EATING.
DO YOU HEAR ME, MELONS?
GET A MINI YOYO OR A PLASTIC
SHERIFF'S BADGE IN THERE AND
THEN WE'LL TALK.
BUT I AM TROUBLED THAT CROPS ARE
BEING WIPED OUT BY A FUNG GUS
CALLED TROPICAL RACE FOUR.
SHOCKING.
NOT JUST BECAUSE TROPICAL RACE
FOUR ISN'T THE NAME OF A VIN
DIESEL MOVIE.
WHAT'S WORSE, THIS BA THAT FA
BLIGHT COULD SOON BE REACHING
OUR SHORES AS AUSTRALIAN BANANA
FARMER ROBERT BORSOTTO SAID,
"AMERICANS ARE SNOOKERED.
THEY BETTER WAKE UP AND REALIZE
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY
BANANAS TO EAT."
CRIKEY.
FOLKS, IF WE LOSE ALL OUR
BANANAS, IN OFFICE BREAK ROOM,
WHAT WILL WE REACH PAST TO GET
TO THE DORITOS?
AND TROPICAL RACE FOUR HAS
ALREADY WIPED OUT 70% OF TAIWANS
CROPS.
IT WAS SO DEVASTATING THAT IN
MALAYSIA ONE NEWSPAPER CALLED IT
THE H.I.V. OF BA THAT MA
PLANTATIONS.
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY MY HIGH
SCHOOL HEALTH TEACHER KEPT
PUTTING CONDOMS ON THEM.
AND... YES.
MOST ALARMINGLY, FOLKS, TROPICAL
RACE FOUR TARGETS CAVENDISH
BANANAS.
WHICH I BET IS YOUR FAVORITE
KIND OF BANANA.
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY KIND OF
BANANA.
AND I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU THAT THE CAVENDISH
BANANA WAS NAMED AFTER WILLIAM
CAVENDISH, THE SIXTH DUKE OF
DEVANSHIRE, BECAUSE LIKE MOST
BRITISH NOBILITY, HE HAD WAXY
YELLOW SKIN AND BRUISED EASILY.
SO IT LOOKS BAD FOR BANANAS.
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT CHINESE
CHARACTER FOR BANANA IS THE SAME
CHARACTER FOR OPPORTUNITY?
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO MAKE
MUST BE.
NOW AS A MUSEMAN, I AM
PROHIBITED BY MY PROFESSIONAL
ETHICS AND FEDERAL LAW FROM
GIVING YOU INVESTMENT ADVICE
DURING MY PROGRAM.
SO I NOT, NOT SAYING YOU WOULD
MAKE A SMALL BUT GUARANTEED
FORTUNE BY INVESTING IN THE
TWINGDLING SUPPLY OF OUR
PRECIOUS BANANAS.
BUT I'M SWRUS SAYING THINK ABOUT
IT, PRAY ON IT, TALK IT OVER
WITH YOUR FAMILY.
JUST DON'T TALK IT OVER WITH
YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS
IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM OUR
SPONSOR.
HI.
I'M STEPHEN COLBERT FOR YELLOW
LINE.
WITH THE COMING BANANA SHORTAGE.
BANANAS WILL SOON BE AS RARE AND
AS PRECIOUS AS GOLD.
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, BANANAS WILL
BE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN BANANA.
YOU MAY BE ASKING, IS NOW THE
RIGHT TIME TO INVEST IN BANANAS.
IN THESE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC
TIMES, YOU WANT ANEN INVESTMENT
YOU CAN SEE AND TOUCH.
AND AT YELLOW LINE, WE KNOW
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A DEMAND
FOR BANANAS BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM
WHAT WILL FUNNY UNCLES USE TO
PRETEND TO BE ON A PHONE?
SAUSAGE?
LET'S HOPE NOT.
THAT'S WHY YELLOW LINE IS PROUD
TO OFFER A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY TOEN VEST IN BANANA.
I DID.
IN FACT, I HAVE INVESTED ALL MY
LIFE SAVINGS IN BANANA BECAUSE
ONE THEN WE KNOW, BANANAS NEVER
LOSE THEIR VALUE.
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY WERE FINE WHEN I PUT THEM
IN HERE IN OCTOBER.
HOW AM I GOING TO MAKE BANANA
SPLITS WITH ALL MY ICE CREAM.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?
OH, JESUS.
OH, NO.
NOT THE ICE CREAM, TOO.
I'M RUINED.
OH, NO.
>> YELLOW LINE, IT MAKES AS MUCH
SENSE AS GOAL.
>> WHAT DO I
