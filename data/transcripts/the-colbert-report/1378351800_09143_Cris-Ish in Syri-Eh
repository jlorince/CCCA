(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.
(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"
EVERYBODY OUT THERE, IN HERE,
ALL AROUND THE WORLD, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,
FOLKS.
YOU ASKED THESE PEOPLE, THEY
KNOW, I'VE GOT A BUG UP MY ASS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PLACE.
(LAUGHTER)
I'LL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN WARNING
YOU FOR YEARS -- HERE'S WHAT
IT'S ABOUT.
I'VE BEEN WARNING YOU FOR YEARS
THAT BARACK OBAMA IS A WEAK
LEADER AND HE HAS PROVEN ME
RIGHT ONCE AGAIN.
DAMN MY GIFT!
(LAUGHTER)
THE MAN COULD NOT LEAD US ON
HEALTH CARE REFORM.
HE COULD NOT LEAD US ON THE
BUDGET TALKS.
AND NOW HE CAN NOT LEAD US INTO
WAR.
SPECIFICALLY WITH SYRIA!
WHERE DICTATOR AND HIGH SCHOOL
FRESHMAN TRYING TO GROW A
MUSTACHE BASHAR AL-ASSAD --
(LAUGHTER).
-- HAS USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE.
NOW, AS THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN,
AMERICA HAS A MORAL IMPERATIVE
TO BLOW SOME (BLEEP) UP!
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THANKS TO OBAMA'S LIMP
LEADERSHIP, THAT IDEA IS GOING
OVER LIKE A TURD FALAFEL.
ONLY 29% OF AMERICANS WANT US TO
ATTACK SYRIA.
NOW, ON THE PLUS SIDE, THAT
MEANS 29% OF AMERICANS KNOW
THERE IS A PLACE CALLED SYRIA.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH, FOLKS.
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF HOW OBAMA IS
SELLING IT!
>> I HAVE DECIDED THAT THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIAN
REGIME TARGETS.
THIS WOULD NOT BE AN OPEN-ENDED
INTERVENTION.
WE WOULD NOT PUT BOOTS ON THE
GROUND.
INSTEAD, OUR ACTION WOULD BE
DESIGNED TO BE LIMITED IN
DURATION AND SCOPE.
OUR CAPACITY TO EXECUTE THIS
MISSION IS NOT TIME SENSITIVE.
IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE TOMORROW OR
NEXT WEEK OR ONE MONTH FROM NOW.
I I TRANSLATION, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, WE WON'T
DO MUCH AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHEN WE DO IT.
WHO'S WITH ME?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
GET BEHIND THAT?
I'VE GOT A CRACK GRAPHICS
DEPARTMENT UPSTAIRS READY TO
MAKE A SIZZLING TITLE SEQUENCE
LIKE "AMERICA AT WAR!"
OR "DESERT STORM" OR "SHOW DOWN
IN THE GULF."
BUT THANKS TO OBAMA, THIS IS THE
BEST THEY COULD DO!
>> CRISIS SYRIA.
(PLAYING "PRICE IS RIGHT LOSER
THEME).
(LAUGHTER)
WHERE'S THE EXCITEMENT, OBAMA?
WHERE THE ZAZZ?
COME ON YOU PUSSSY, SLAP SOME
ANDROGEL ON AND GROW A PAIR!
YOU'RE THE GODDAMNED
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA!
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SET A
RED LINE!
>> I DIDN'T SET A RED LINE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE WORLD SET A RED LINE.
>> THE WORLD?
WHO CARES ABOUT THE WORLD?
WE'RE AMERICA!
IF WE CARED ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD
IS WE'D EAT FLAN AND WATCH
SOCCER.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, I'M SORRY, FUTBALL.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS?
I MISS GEORGE W. BUSH.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
THAT MAN -- YEAH, I CAN TELL YOU
MISS HIM, TOO.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT MANU HOW TO SELL A WAR.
OBAMA HAS HARD EVIDENCE OF
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND
HE CAN'T EVEN GET ENGLAND TO GO
ALONG WITH IT.
MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT BUSH GOTTEN
A INTERNATIONAL COALITION WITH
NOTHING MORE THAN COLIN POWELL'S
REPUTATION AND HALF A TEST TUBE
OF CRYSTAL LIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME WAR
MARKETING?
BUSH HAD US HANGING ON EVERY
WORD BECAUSE BY THE NEXT WORD HE
MIGHT ALL BE DEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A HOMICIDAL
DICTATOR WHO IS ADDICTED TO
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
ING A SEUSZ OF EVIL.
50 TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND A
TURKEY FARM.
MOBILE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS LABS.
SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF
URANIUM.
THE REGIME SEEKING A NUCLEAR
BOMB.
THE SMOKING GUN.
IT COULD COME IN THE FORM OF A
MUSHROOM CLOUD.
>> GOD I LOVE BEING LIED TO BY A
PROFESSIONAL!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN FEEL THE HAND
CRAFTSMANSHIP SO PRESIDENT
OBAMA, YOU COULD LEARN A THING
OR TWO ABOUT SALESMANSHIP FROM
THIS GOOD MAN!
STOP ASKING OUR PERMISSION AND
START TELLING US OUR PEREL, LIKE
THIS: MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS USED POISON
GAS ON HIS OWN PEOPLE.
IF WE DO NOT RESPOND SOURCES SAY
NEXT HE WILL HIT EPCOT THEREBY
TAKING OUT PARIS, LONDON, AND
CHINA AND IT FLOWS OVER TO
DISNEY, THAT'S ALL OF OUR
ROBOTIC PRESIDENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
FURTHER MORE, WE HAVE SATELLITE
PHOTOS OF HIM PUNCHING YOUR
MOTHER AND SODOMIZING A
BASEBALL!
AND HE HAS PURCHASED URANIUM
FROM HITLER'S GHOST.
(LAUGHTER)
IT IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO
STOP THIS MADMAN AND IF BRITAIN
WON'T HELP US, I SAY (BLEEP)
'EM, FROM NOW ON ENGLISH MUFFINS
WILL BE CALLED LIBERTY TOAST
BECAUSE AMERICA --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-- AMERICA, THIS LAND IS MY LAND
AND YOUR LAND AND AMERICA DOES
NOT BACK DOWN ON THE FACE OF
TYRANNY.
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.
FOOL ME TWICE A PENNY SAVE SAD
HORSE TO WATER WHOSE COLORS DO
NOT RUN!
MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES
