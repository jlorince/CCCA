HAPPENED.
NATION, YOU KNOW I AM A LONGTIME
FAN OF IOWA CONGRESSMAN AND MAN
TRYING TO FORGET WHAT HE BURIED
IN THAT CORNFIELD, STEVE KING,
BECAUSE TIME AND AGAIN,
REPRESENTATIVE KING HAS STOOD UP
TO THE "LET'S NOT ABUSE ANIMALS"
LOBBY.
OVER THE YEARS HES COME OUT IN
FAVOR OF DOG FIGHTING, SPONSORED
A FARM BILL AMENDMENT TO
LEGALIZE ARSENIC IN CHICKEN FEED
AND VOTE AGAINST EVACUATING PETS
FROM DISASTER AREAS.
HEY, DOGS ARE SAFE IN A TORNADO
AS SLONG AS THEY CHASE THEIR
TAILS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
OF THE WIND TUNNEL.
IT CAN'T SUCK THEM UP.
THAT'S SCIENCE.
WELL, NOW, REPRESENTATIVE KING
IS FIGHTING BACK AGAINST A
CALIFORNIA LAW THAT PAMPERS OUR
POLL TREE WITH SPACIOUS NEW
DIGS.
>> WHEN IOWA LAWMAKERS WANTS TO
FEDERALIZE AN OVERRIDE OF
CALIFORNIA LAW WRITTEN BY THE
ANIMAL RIGHTS LOBBY THAT
DICTATES HOW AMERICA RAISES
LIVESTOCK.
>> THE HUMANE SOCIETY HELPED
PASS A LAW TRIPLING THE SIZE OF
CAGES FOR EGG-LAYING HENS, NOT
JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT ANY
PRODUCER THAT SOLD EGGS IN THE
GOLDEN STATE.
>> IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR
CALIFORNIA TO DO WHAT IT DID.
WE CAN'T IMPOSE THAT MISTAKE ON
THE REST OF AMERICA.
>> Stephen:  DAMN STRAIGHT.
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CASE OF THE
LEFT WING LOONS IN CALIFORNIA
IMPOSING THEIR DEVIANT VALUES ON
THE HEARTLAND.
I BET THOSE CALIFORNIA CHICKENS
DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE MARRIED
BEFORE THEY HAVE AN EGG.
AND WHERE, WHERE ON EARTH ARE
FARMERS IN STEVE KING'S HOME
STATE OF IOWA SUPPOSED TO PUT
THESE LARGER CAGES.
I'M SORRY, BUT IOWA IS ALREADY
FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH EMPTY.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, FOLKS, JUST-- AND I WANT
YOU TO LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO
LISTEN TO THE DETAILS OF THIS
INSANE LAW.
IT MANDATES THAT CHICKEN CAGES
BE A PALEACEOUS 200 SQUARE
INCHES.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THIS EGG
McMANSION.
THIS IS A CHICKEN XANADU.
IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN THE CAGES
KEEP MY INTERNS IN.
BY THE WAY, BY THE THE WAY, THEY
HAVE YET TO PRODUCE A SINGLE
EGG.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM
IS.
MAYBE I'M NOT FEEDING THEM
ENOUGH ARSENIC.
AND WITH 200 PURE CHICKEN INCHES
OF LUXURY, THESE BIRDS CAN DO
THE UNTHINKABLE-- TURN AROUND.
NOW, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE
SURE THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO
ME WHEN I GIVE THEM THEIR
PRELAYING PEP TALK.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP, LADIES.
TODAY IS THE DAY.
NO ONE PHONE IT IN.
I'M LOOKING FOR JUMBOS.
SO GRIT YOUR BEAKS, PICK A SPOT
ON THE WALL.
I WANT TO YOU BEAR DOWN.
I WANT TO SQUAT OUT AN EGG SO
MASSIVE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A
GODDAMN EPIDURAL.
REMEMBER, A.B.C.-- ALWAYS BE
CHICKENS.
LET'S DO THIS THING.
COME ON!
HANDS IN FOR PRAYER.
LATER, WE DO TRUST FALLS OVER A
DEEP FAT FRIAR.
BUT, FOLKS, THIS CAGE LAW, THIS
CAGE LAW HERE COULD LEAD TO
SOMETHING EVEN WORSE THAN
UNDISCIPLINED CHICKENS.
>> FARMERS NATIONWIDE FEAR
PRECEDENT.
>> IF ONE STATE CAN TELL THEM
HOW TO RAISE CHICKENS, WHAT'S
NEXT?
FREE-RANGE COWS AND PIGS?
>> Stephen:  I MEAN, ANIMALS
ABLE TO MOVE THEIR LIMBS?
WHERE DOES THE MADNESS END?
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, PRIGZ
REQUIRED TO GLIMPSE THE SKY
BEFORE DEATH.
AND AFTER THAT, IT'S A SHORT
LEAP FOR COWS NOT BEING FED
THEIR GROUND UP PARENTS.
IT'S POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE
WILD.
I CAN TELL YOU'RE UPSET, TOO.
STEVE KING AND I KNOW WE
SHOULDN'T BE MAKING THESE CAGES
BIGGER.
IF ANYTHING, WE CAN GO SMALLER.
I MEAN, JUST DO HOWEVER THEY
RAISE THOSE BONELESS CHICKENS.
I MEAN, YOU CAN JUST DEFOOT THEM
AND MAKE THEM LIVE IN A PAPER
TOWEL TUBE.
SEE?
SEE?
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT?
HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY IN HERE,
AREN'T YOU?
AREN'T YOU, BABY?
ALL RIGHT, AND THEN WHEN YOU
WANT A NICE, FRESH EGG, JUST
SQUEEZE AND THERE YOU GO.
NICE WORK SHIRLEY.
NICE WORK.
NOW IT'S FEEDING TIME.
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, VERY GOOD.
SHE'S HAVING FUN, OKAY.
AND IT'S TOTALLY-- IT'S TOTALLY
HUMANE.
SEE, SHE'S FREE RANGE.
LOOK AT HER GO.
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.
PUT THAT BACK UP THERE.
CONGRESSMAN PASS A LAW MANDATING
MY NEW TUBE CAGES.
WE CAN CALL IT "CHICKEN A LA
KING."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
