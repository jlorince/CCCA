FOLKS, FINALLY SOME GOOD NEWS,
NO ONE LIKES BARACK OBAMA.
[LAUGHTER]
HIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE AT THE
LOWEST OF HIS PRESIDENCY.
ACCORDING TO QUINNIPIAC ONLY 42%
APPROVE.
IT'S OVER, FOLKS.
TAKE DOWN HIS PORTRAIT AT THE
POST OFFICE AND THROW UP A BLACK
LIGHT POSTER OF A UNICORN UNTIL
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WINS IN
2012.
SO FAR THE FRONT RUNNER IS TIM
PAWLENTY IN THAT HE IS THE ONLY
ONE RUNNING.
HE MADE SOME AWESOME PRECAMPAIGN
VIDEOS.
>> EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT IT TAKES
TAKES --
>> Stephen: LISTEN TO THAT
THUPBD RUSS HANDSHAKE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT IS A STRONG GRIP.
[LAUGHTER]
NOTE TO SELF:  IF OFFERED,
POLITELY DECLINE HAND (bleep)
FROM TIM PAWLENTY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN BUT JUST -- THE
RAMIFICATIONS ARE TERRIFYING.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY.
THEN AFTER THAT COMMERCIAL HE HE
SWUNG HIS POLITICAL WEIGHT
BEHIND WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT
WALKER.
>> REAL SIMPLE, WE'RE BROKE.
>> TO PREVENT A --
>> EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT
THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING, DO
THEY KNOW WHERE THEIR LEADERS
ARE.
>> IT'S IMPORTANT AMERICA STAND
WITH WALKER AND WISCONSIN.
>> Stephen: I WAS SO INSPIRED
I HAD TO STAND WITH THEM BY
MAKING MY OWN AD.
JIMMY, GIVE THESE PEOPLE ANOTHER
TASTE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I
GIVE MY EDITORS THEIR OWN
ESPRESSO MACHINE.
>> WE'RE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, I WILL
SHOVE YOU IN FRONT OF A TRAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
FIREWORKS ARE PRETTY.
WE PUT A MAN ON THE MOON.
WHY CAN'T YOU HOLD THE CAMERA
STEADY?
[LAUGHTER]
JOIN ME STEPHEN COLBERT JOINING
TIM PAWLENTY JOINING SCOTT
WALKER, JOIN ME JOINING TIM
JOINING SCOTT ON COLBERT

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: I KNOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S STIRRING STUFF.
NOW, AT THE END THERE I URGE YOU
TO GOOD TO COLBERTPACK.COM.
IN THE FIRST 12 HOURS AFTER THAT
AD WAS SHOWN 25,000 OF YOU DID
JUST THAT WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF
WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO.
THE EXACT SAME APPROACH I TAKE
WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
NOW AT THIS POINT SOME OF YOU
MAY BE WONDERING WHAT IS COMFORT
COMFORT -- COLBERTPACK.
GET IN LINE I HAVE NO IDEA.
BEING A PUNDIT THESE DAYS IS NOT
ENOUGH ANYMORE.
IF YOU WANT TO BE A POLITICAL
PLAYA IN 2012 YOU NEED A PACK.
LOOK AT MY FELLOW PUNDITS SARAH
PALIN HAS SARAHPACK.
MIKE HUCKABEE HAS HUCKPACK.
THAT'S CLINGON, I BELIEVE, FOR
OUT AFTER IOWA
