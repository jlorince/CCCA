CREATE THE MODEL FOR OBAMACARE.
JOINING ME NOW TO TELL ME IF WE
SHOULD ASK A DEAD CAT TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT IS THE CAMPAIGN
MANAGER OF THE JOHN McCAIN '08
CAMPAIGN, RICK DAVIS.
RICK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
THANKS FOR STOPPING.
OKAY.
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD HIM.
CHRISTIE SAID DEFINITIVELY THIS
AFTERNOON HE IS NOT GOING TO
RUN.
FOR SURE.
IS HE GOING TO RUN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NOT GUN THAT RUN.
>> Stephen: OKAY, HE'S SAID THAT
BEFORE.
>> CONSISTENTLY.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO RUN.
>> Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THE
VOTERS WANT, SOMEONE WHO'S
CONSISTENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T THAT JUST
MAKE HIM MORE APPEALING?
HE'S JUST PLAYING HARD TO 'NAM
NATE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HE MAY BE MORE APPEALING BUT
HE'S STILL NOT GOING TO BE A
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: OKAY WITH CHRISTIE
OUT OF THE WAY, DO REPUBLICANS
JUST FALL IN LINE NOW BEHIND
ROMNEY BECAUSE THEY SAY
DEMOCRATS FALL IN LOVE,
REPUBLICANS FALL IN LINE.
DO WE JUST LAY BACK, CLOSE OUR
EYES AND GO "IT'S FOR THE GOOD
OF THE PARTY, PUT YOUR BALLOT IN
MY BOX."
(LAUGHTER)
>> THERE'S A LITTLE OF THAT BUT
I THINK IT COMES LATER.
IN OTHER WORDS I THINK....
>> Stephen: THERE'S SOME
FOREPLAY FIRST, IS WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING?
>> EXACTLY.
>> Stephen: THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU.
>> WELL, IT MAY BE MORE THAN
WE'VE SEEN TO DATE INTO THIS
RACE BUT ROMNEY WILL GET A LOOK
NOW THAT HE HASN'T REALLY HAD.
EVERYBODY'S BEEN FOCUSED ON
MICHELE BACHMANN AND CHRISTIE
THIS WEEK AND PERRY OBVIOUSLY
HAD HIS MOMENT IN THE SUN.
NOW, YOU KNOW, ROMNEY'S GOING TO
HAVE TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP AND
THIS IS GOING TO BE A TIME FOR
HIM TO REALLY SHOW WHAT HE'S GOT
AS A CANDIDATE.
>> Stephen: THIS THIS REALLY THE
LAST OF THE SPECULATION?
WHAT ABOUT SARAH PALIN?
SHE'S STILL OUT THERE, SHE COULD
STILL JUMP IN.
>> WELL, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM
HER IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS SO
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON.
>> Stephen: IF SHE GOT IN, COULD
PALIN SHAKE THINGS UP?
>> WELL, THERE'S NO QUESTION
PALIN WILL SHAKE THINGS UP AS A
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF ENERGY BEHIND
HER.
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF THE SUPPORT
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SEEN
MOVING AROUND WITH CAIN AND
PERRY AND THESE GUYS SO, SURE.
IT RESETS THE WHOLE CLOCK AGAIN
BUT WE'RE AT THE 11th HOUR AT
THIS POINT.
>> Stephen: YOU WERE THE
CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DOLE AND
McCAIN, ANY CHANCE THOSE TWO
GUYS WOULD JUMP IN?
A TICKET?
DOLE/McCAIN.
TIME TESTED, CURED LIKE BEEF.
>> I LIKE IT.
YOU HAVE IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE
COVERED.
>> Stephen: ALREADY SEWN UP.
SO IS THERE SOME MAGIC THING
ROMNEY COULD DO TO GET PEOPLE
EXCITED?
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PEOPLE ANYBODY
WHO LIKES ROMNEY ALREADY LIKES
ROMNEY AND OTHER PEOPLE...
>> ROMNEY HAS TO SHOW HE HAS THE
LEADERSHIP CHOPS THAT HE CAN
TAKE THE REPUBLICAN PART CESHGS
PUT IT UNDER HIS ARMS AND RUN TO
VICTORY IN NOVEMBER.
HE'S GOT TO SHOW HE CAN BEAT
BARACK OBAMA WHICH IS GOING TO
BE THE DRIVING INFLUENCE BY WHO
YOU SUPPORT IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.
>> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THAT.
YOU'VE GOT ROMNEY VERSUS OBAMA A
MATCHUP BETWEEN A REPUBLICAN
THAT NOBODY'S EXCITED ABOUT AND
A DEMOCRAT EVERYONE'S
DISAPPOINTED IN.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO WINS?
>> ULTIMATELY THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WIN.
(LAUGHTER)
TOUGH CHOICE.
AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE
ECONOMY.
I THINK PEOPLE WILL BASICALLY
VOTE BASED ON WHAT THEY THINK IS
GOING TO BE BEST FOR THE
ECONOMY.
>> Stephen: SO THE DEFAULT WILL
BE IS ROMNEY BETTER AT PUTTING
THINGS BACK ON TRACK OR DO WE
GIVE BARACK OBAMA ANOTHER SHOT
AT IT IS.
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED TO
PERRY?
I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT GUY!
HE WAS A PROVEN JOB MAKER IN
TEXAS.
HEED THAT EVANGELICAL VOTE.
WHY DID HE CRAP OUT SO HARD?
>> WELL, POLITICS IS TOUGH
BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: IT AIN'T TIDDLEDY
WINKS.
>> IT'S NOT TIDDLEDY WINKS.
SO YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU COULD BE
A WILDLY SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE AT
THE STATE LEVEL, HE'S OBVIOUSLY
AN INCREDIBLY POPULAR GOVERNOR
OF TEXAS AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO
TAKE THAT ON THE ROAD, YOU KNOW,
STRANGE THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
I WOULD SAY IT'S TOO EARLY TO
TELL....
>> Stephen: CAN HE COME BACK?
>> SURE, JOHN McCAIN CAME BACK
FROM BEING FIRST TO LAST TO
FIRST AGAIN.
>> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
AND THE FIRST TERM OF HIS
PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN FANTASTIC.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR ME.
>> Stephen: I'M SURE IT HAS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH RICK DAVIS.
POLITICAL STRATEGIST RICK DAVIS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
