(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME BACK TO OUR CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF TONIGHT'S SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)
FOLKS, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT
CHOICES IN THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL FIELD, WHO CAN
PICK?
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S LIKE GOING TO THE KENNEL
AND WANTING TO BRING HOME ALL
THE PUPPIES BEFORE GOVERNOR
PERRY HAS THEM PUT DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I HAVE AN ESPECIALLY SOFT
SPOT FOR AN UNDERDOG AND FRIEND
OF THE SHOW RON PAUL.
HE FINISHED A CLOSE SECOND AT
THE AMES STRAW POLL AND HE'S
POLLING NATIONALLY IN THE TOP
THREE AHEAD OF MICHELE BACHMANN
WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF PLUS
OR MINUS "LET SIX PEOPLE DIE."
(LAUGHTER)
AND YET I'M THE ONLY PUNDIT
WILLING TO ADMIT TO HAVING AN
INCURABLE CASE OF RON PALSY.
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE
OTHER CANDIDATES WHO HAVE
WRACKED UP SOME HIGH-PROFILE
ENDORSEMENTS.
MINNESOTA GOVERNOR TIM PAWLENTY
HAS THROWN HIS BABY EGRET LIKE
WEIGHT BEHIND MITT ROMNEY AND
JUST YESTERDAY RICK PERRY
SECURED THE BACKING OF CURRENT
LOUISIANA GOVERNOR AND FORMER
WIGGLE IN THE PURPLE SHIRT BOBBY
JINDAL.
BUT WHAT RON PAUL REALLY NEEDS,
FOLKS, IS A CREDIBLE NATIONAL
ENDORSEMENT TO GIVE HIS CAMPAIGN
THE KIND OF LEGITIMACY HIS
CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO
GET FROM HIS CAMPAIGN.
(LAUGHTER)
LUCKILY, A BIG ENDORSEMENT JUST
CAME IN FROM A PASSIONATE
HEARTLAND CONSERVATIVE WHO
ANNOUNCED HIS SUPPORT ON
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC'S "FRONTIER
FORCE."
>> READ YOUR CONSTITUTION!
>> OKAY?
>> ALL RIGHT?
THE CONSTITUTION IS YOUR RIGHT
TO!
DON'T GO... CONSTITUTION!
YOU GUYS... JUSTICE... WHY CAN'T
YOU GUYS JUST SIT DOWN TO ME
THAT THIS IS MY CONSTITUTION.
WHAT'S THE FIRST AMENDMENT?
WHAT'S THE FIRST SNAEPLT WHAT'S
THE FIRST AMENDMENT?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW!
(LAUGHTER)
HA!
YEAH, CONSTITUTION!
READ IT AND LIVE BY IT.
>>
>> RON PAUL 2012!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: YES!
RON PAUL!
RON PAUL HAS LOCKED UP THE
COVETED (BLEEP) FACED VOTE.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS COULD BE HUGE FOR HIM.
IF THESE GUYS DRIVE TO THE POLLS
ON ELECTION DAY PROVIDED THEY
DON'T FIRST PLOW INTO A FARMER'S
MARKET.
AND THIS GUY IS AN ELOQUENT
MOUTHPIECE FOR LIBERTARIAN
IDEAS.
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE...
>> I'M TELLING NOBODY.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
WHAT'S THE LEGAL LIMIT OF
HURTING SOMEBODY?
>> YEAH, THE LEGAL LIMIT IS JUST
MORE NANNY STATE REGULATIONS.
THIS WAS A VICTIMLESS CRIME.
NO ONE GOT HURT BECAUSE LEGALLY
A LIVER IS NOT A PERSON!
(LAUGHTER)
SO CONGRATULATIONS, RON PAUL,
YOUR SHIP HAS FINALLY COME IN.
