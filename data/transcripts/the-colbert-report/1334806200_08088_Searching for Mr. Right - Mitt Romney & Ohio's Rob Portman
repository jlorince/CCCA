(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
PLEASE, PLEASE, SAVE YOUR ENERGY FOLKS.
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I WANT TO VERY SPECIFICALLY NOT GIVE A SHOUTOUT TO MY BRONYS TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN SUCKED INTO A DARK CORNER OF HUMANITY.
I'M CRAWLING MY WAY BACK TOWARDS THE LIGHT.
NATION, NOW THAT WE CONSERVATIVES ARE ALL THRILLED TO HAVE NO OPTION BUT MITT
ROMNEY SPECULATION TURNS TO WHO WILL BE FORCED TO ACCEPT AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
NOW, OFTEN THE V.P. SLOT IS FILLED BY A STRONG FORMER CANDIDATE AND THEY DON'T COME
ANY STRONGER OR MORE FORMER THAN RICK SANTORUM.
(LAUGHTER) NOT ONLY IS HE SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE BUT HE'S RECENTLY
PROVEN THAT HE MEANT EVERYTHING HE SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
>> RICK SANTORUM, MINCING NO WORDS ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS OF MITT ROMNEY.
IN A LETTER TO IOWA VOTERS THIS WEEK, SANTORUM SAYS "IT TRULY FRIGHT FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF MITT ROMNEY IS THE NOMINEE."
>> Stephen: OKAY, THAT SOUNDS ROUGH.
(LAUGHTER) BUT CLEARLY RICK IS JUST PROVING HIS PRO-FAMILY CREDENTIALS BY
REJECTING ANY PARTNERSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAN.
(LAUGHTER) SO WHO IS ROMNEY'S PERFECT MATCH?
THE I DIDN'T KNOW TO HIS YANK WHO CAN APPEAL TO HIS COP SERVEIVE THE BASE WITHOUT BEING
MORE INTERESTING THAN HE IS?
WELL, FOLKS, WE'LL EXPLORE THAT QUESTION IN TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT OF "MITT ROMNEY:
SEARCHING FOR MR. RIGHT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW A LOT OF NAMES ARE BEING
TOSSED OUT RIGHT NOW FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL SLOT, BUT ONE NAME IS SURGING TO THE TOP OF
THE LIST OF PEOPLE YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF.
JIM?
>> ROMNEY HAS TO START THE PROCESS OF SELECTING A RUNNING MATE.
OHIO SENATOR ROB PORTMAN IS THE LATEST OBJECT OF SPECULATION FOR AN INSIDE TRACK.
>> ROB PORTMAN WOULD HELP IN OHIO.
VERY SMART AND CONSERVATIVE.
>> ROB PORTMAN LEAVES THE SAVE AND SOLID CATEGORY.
>> ROB PORTMAN, A SEASONED THOUGH NOT SCINTILLATING WASHINGTON VETERAN OF CONGRESS.
>> ROMNEY IS BETTER SERVED WITH A PORTMAN, SOMEBODY NOT AS EXCITING.
>> GO BORING.
PUT PORTMAN ON THE TICKET.
>> YES, NOTHING FIRES UP THE BASE LIKE BORING.
BECAUSE ROMNEY DOESN'T WANT SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO UPSTAGE
HIM AND JUST LOOK AT THESE TWO TOGETHER.
IT'S LIKE THE BLABD LEADING THE BLAND.
(LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY NOW THAT I SEE THEM SIDE BY SIDE I
WONDER IF PORTMAN MIGHT HAVE TOO MUCH CHARISMA.
I MEAN, BLUE SHIRT, RED TIE.
THOSE ARE COLORS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM.
(LAUGHTER) MAYBE ROMNEY SHOULD GO WITH SOMETHING BLANDER LIKE A HEADLESS JOSEPH A. BANK
MANNEQUIN OR A RICE CAKE OR A HEEL OF WHITE BREAD.
NO, THEY'RE ALL TOO FASCINATING.
DAMN IT.
WHO CAN MITT ROMNEY FIND WHO WON'T OVERSHADOW HIM?
WAIT!
THAT'S IT!
THE PERFECT TICKET!
ROMNEY/ROMNEY SHADOW 2012.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THE BEST PART IS IT WILL CHANGE POSITIONS EVER
