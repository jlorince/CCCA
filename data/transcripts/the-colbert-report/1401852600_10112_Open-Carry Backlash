>> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT THANK YOU FORJOINING US, EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)>> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN!
THAT WAS A FIRST!
THAT WAS A FIRST!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN!
I'VE GOT TO SAY, YOUR ENTHUSIASMTONIGHT, WHAT YOU JUST DID
ALMOST LED TO A FIRST ON THESHOW!
I ALMOST STARTED CHANTING"STEPHEN, STEPHEN" MYSELF, BUT
THEN I CAUGHT MYSELF(CHEERING)
I ONLY DO THAT WHEN I'M SHAVINGIN THE MORNING.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, THERE'S NO BIGGER
DEFENDER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENTTHAN FACEY-FACE RIGHT HERE.
(LAUGHTER)I'VE ALWAYS SAID, THE BEST
DEFENSE AGAINST A BAD GUY WITH AGUN IS A GOOD GUY HOARDING GUNS
IN A BACKWOODS SHACK MUTTERINGTO HIMSELF ABOUT THE COMING RACE
WAR.
WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT THEOPEN-CARRY MOVEMENT, WHERE
PATRIOTS STAND UP FOR THE SECONDAMENDMENT BY PROUDLY DISPLAYING
THEIR GUNS IN PUBLIC PLACES,LIKE A PATRIOT FEST LAST MONTH
WHERE THESE TWO BUDDIES POSTEDPHOTOS OF THEMSELVES WITH THEIR
GUNS AT A CHIPOTLE.
(LAUGHTER)THEY WERE TELLING THE WORLD
THEY'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THEIR GUNLOVE.
THEY ARE OUT AND THEY ARE PROUD.
"WE'RE HERE, WE'VE GOT GEAR, GETUSED TO IT."
(LAUGHTER)BUT I'M SO SAD TO REPORT THAT
THE RESPONSE TO THIS CHIPOTLECHIPROTEST WAS FOR CHIPOTLE AND
A WHOLE SLOUGH OF OTHERRESTAURANTS TO OPPRESS GUN
LOVERS.
>> CHIPOTLE IS ASKING CUSTOMERSNOT TO BRING GUNS INTO ITS
RESTAURANTS.
>> MORE RESTAURANTS ARE JUMPINGON THE NO-GUNS-ALLOWED
BANDWAGON.
SONIC AND CHILI'S TELLINGCUSTOMERS TO LEAVE THEIR GUNS AT
HOME.
GUNS ALSO NOT WELCOME ATSTARBUCKS, WENDY'S, JACK IN THE
BOX AND APPLEBEE'S.
>> LOOK AT THAT, IT'S A DOMINOEFFECT.
OH GOD, I JUST HOPE THIS DOESN'TSPREAD TO DOMINOES!
(LAUGHTER)I LIKE TO HAVE A GUN ON HAND
AFTER I EAT ONE BECAUSE I FEELLIKE KILLING MYSELF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NATION, THESE RESTAURANTS ARE
FORCING PATRIOTS TO MAKE THEHARDEST CHOICE ANY AMERICAN CAN
FACE -- BETWEEN HIGH-POWEREDWEAPONRY AND FRIED FOOD.
BOTH ARE DEADLY, BUT ONLY ONE COMES WITH MELTED CHEESE.
AND IT'S ALREADY BECOMING AWEDGE ISSUE.
A WEDGE OF CHEESE ISSUE.
BECAUSE NOW OUR SECOND AMENDMENTRIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE
LIBERAL WHACKOS AT THE NATIONALRIFLE ASSOCIATION, WHO ON THEIR
WEBSITE SLANDERED THESE GOODMEN, SAYING...
WELL, A 7.62 IS WEIRD.
WHY WOULD YOU WEAR A 7.62 AFTERMEMORIAL DAY?
IT'S SUMMER.
YOU WANNA WEAR SOMETHING MORELIGHT, MORE KICKY.
MAYBE AN UZI WITH A FOLDINGSTOCK.
YOU KNOW, FUN.
(LAUGHTER)SOMETHING THAT SAYS "I'M READY
FOR THE BEACH, AND IF THE RIGHTGUY COMES ALONG, A FIREFIGHT."
BUT BY NOT UNCONDITIONALLYSUPPORTING THESE MEN, THE N.R.A.
IS STABBING ALL GUN LOVERS INTHE BACK, WHEN IT SHOULD BE
SHOOTING US IN THE FRONT.
THAT'S WHY THE ORGANIZATIONBEHIND THE CHIPOTLE PHOTOS
OPEN-CARRY TEXAS IS FIRING BACK.
ON THEIR Facebook SITE, THEYCHALLENGED THE N.R.A. SAYING,
"IF THEY DO NOT RETRACT THEIRDISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL
COMMENTS, O.C.T. WILL HAVE NOCHOICE BUT TO WITHDRAW ITS FULL
SUPPORT OF THE N.R.A. ANDESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH
OTHER GUN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONSTHAT FIGHT FOR ALL GUN RIGHTS."
YES, ALL GUN RIGHTS.
DO YOU KNOW SOME GUNS AREN'TEVEN ALLOWED TO VOTE?
(LAUGHTER)AND O.C.T. HAS PLENTY OF OTHER
PRO-GUN GROUPS TO JOIN LIKE"TEXAS CARRY," "GUN RIGHTS
ACROSS AMERICA," AND "COME ANDTAKE IT TEXAS."
(LAUGHTER)   GREAT GROUP, BY THE WAY...
DON'T TRY TO "COME AND TAKE IT."
