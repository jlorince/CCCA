NOW, FOLKS I GOTTA ASK, WHAT ISTHE POINT OF TELLING US ALL THIS
ROUGH STUFF?
NO ONE STILL THINKS THAT IT'SEVER OKAY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE
THIS.
>> FOR THE RECORD, I STILL THINKIT'S OKAY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE
THIS, AS LONG AS IT'S DONE IN AFAIR WAY.
I THINK THE TORTURE-- I'M SORRY,THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION
TECHNIQUE, I THINK IT SERVES APURPOSE.
>> Stephen: ANOTHER, OKAY.
SO ERIC IS IN FAVOR OF TORTURE--I'M SORRY, TORTURE-- IF
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
IF-- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT-- IFIT'S DONE IN A FAIR WAY.
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS THEY BRINGENOUGH HUMAN WASTE BUCKETS FOR
EVERYONE IN THE SECRET PRISON.
I AM WITH FOX'S ANDREA TANTAROSWHO IS STOKED FOR AMERICA COME
WHATEVS.
>> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAIS AWESOME.
WE ARE AWESOME.
BUT WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION.
WE'VE CLOSED THE BOOK ON IT, ANDWE STOPPED DOING IT.
AND THE REASON THEY WANT TO HAVETHIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TO SHOW
HOW AWESOME WE ARE.
THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TOHAVE THIS DISCUSSION TO SHOW US
HOW WE'RE NOT AWESOME.
>> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, THAT'SWHAT THEY WANT.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.
BUT WE ARE AWESOME, AND WE HAVETO BE AWESOME, BECAUSE THE
PEOPLE WE'RE FIGHTING ARETOTALLY RADICAL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )AND THAT'S WHY--
( APPLAUSE )THAT'S WHY, THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO
RESORT TO EXTREEEME MEASURES.
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY, THINGS GOTPRETTY GNARLY.
WE-- WE SHOCKED A BRAU.
( LAUGHTER )( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
NOW BESIDES, ALL OF THIS ISANCIENT HISTORY.
>> WE KNOW IT WAS BAD, BUT WHYBRING IT UP NOW?
>> IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCEWE'VE BEEN DOING ANY OF THIS.
SO THE NEED TO RELEASE THISDOCUMENT WITH A LOT OF GORY
DETAILS AT THIS STAGE OF THEGAME IS HARD TO FIND.
>> WE'RE AT 2014.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THATHAPPENED IN 2006, 2007, SEVEN,
EIGHT YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: YEAH, IT WASSEVEN, EIGHT YEARS AGO.
THE C.I.A. WAS PROBABLY KEEPINGDETAINEES AWAKE BY BLASTING
FEIST.
COME ON. STILL, THERE ARE SOMEBRIGHT SPOTS
IN THIS THING AND NOT JUST THE
SPARKS OFF THE JUMPER TABLESBECAUSE AMERICA'S FORMER
PRESIDENT, AND MY HEART'SFOREVER PRESIDENT, GEORGE W.
BUSH, COMES OFF LOOKING GREAT INTHIS THING.
FOR EXAMPLE, ON PAGE 98 IT SAYS,"THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES HAD DIRECTED HE NOT BEINFORMED OF THE LOCATIONS OF THE
C.I.A. DETENTION FACILITIES TOENSURE HE WOULD NOT ACCIDENTALLY
DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION."
THAT'S RIGHT, NO, THAT'S RIGHT,THAT'S GOOD.
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLTOO EASY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO
ACCIDENTALLY DISCLOSE THIS KINDOF INTEL.
I MEAN, IT'S A SIMPLE SLIP-UPANYBODY COULD MAKE.
WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY ISCONGRATULATIONS TO THE WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIP SAN ANTONIO SPURSBUT WHAT COMES OUT IS WE'RE
STICKING DENTAL TOOLS UPSOMEBODY'S PEE HOLE UNDER A
BULGARIAN DISCO.
THEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THEN, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO
SEND TIM DUNCAN TO THE DISCOBECAUSE HE KNOWS TOO MUCH.
IT'S A MESS.
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT COURAGE THATWILLFUL IGNORANCE TAKES.
AND IT DATES BACK TO OURFOUNDING FATHERS.
REMEMBER, IT WAS GEORGEWASHINGTON WHO FIRST SAID-- AND
I QUOTE-- BLOOOLOOLOOLOOLOO.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT WASGOING ON EITHER BECAUSE HE WAS
TORTURING PEOPLE, TOO.
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
JUST ASK AMATEUR HISTORIAN ANDBROWN-HAIRED GUY WHO'S NOT STEVE
DOOCY OR AN HISTORIAN, BRIANKILMEADE.
>> WHEN SOMEONE OR SOME GROUP ISTRYING TO DESTROY YOU AND YOUR
WAY OF LIFE, YOU NEED TO DOWHATEVER IT TAKES TO STOP THEM.
>> GEORGE WASHINGTON DID, ANDTHAT'S A FACT.
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SAYTHAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE BUILT ON,
WE DON'T BEAT THE BRITISHWITHOUT DOING IT.
>> Stephen: YEAH, WASHINGTONTORTURED THE BRITISH SO HARD,
THEY'RE STILL TALKING FUNNY.
( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
YEAH.
THAT'S HOW WE DID IT.
NOW, WE LOOKED IT UP, AND INACTUALITY, WASHINGTON DIDN'T
TORTURE THEM.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T.
BECAUSE WHILE THE C.I.A. WASCONDUCTING AN ALL-YOU-CAN-PUMP
RECTAL-HYDRATION FESTIVAL,HERE'S WHAT GEORGE BUSH SAID.
>> THE UNITED STATES DOES NOTTORTURE.
>> Stephen: AND HE SHOULD KNOWBECAUSE HE SPECIFICALLY ASKED
NOT TO BE TOLD.
NOW, ANOTHER PERSON WHO DOESN'TWANT TO BE TOLD THINGS IS WOLF
BLITZER, WHO YESTERDAY BLITZEDDIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE SENATE COMMIT THEYRELEASED THIS REPORT.
>> WAS IT WORTH IT TO RELEASETHIS REPORT TODAY IF IN FACT
AMERICAN LIVES, DIPLOMATS,MILITARY PERSONNEL, CIVILIANS
ARE GOING TO BE IN DANGER?
>> LOOK, THERE IS NO PERFECTTIME TO RELEASE THIS REPORT.
THERE HAVE BEEN BEHEADINGS.
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS WITHOUTTHIS REPORT COMING OUT.
>> BUT IF AMERICANS ARE KILLEDAS A RESULT OF THIS REPORT AND
THEY TELL YOU THAT, I ASSUME YOUWOULD FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THAT.
>> I WOULD FEEL VERY BADLY, OFCOURSE.
I MEAN WHAT, DO YOU THINK, WOLFBLITZER?
( LAUGHTER )>> Stephen: YES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, WOLF ISAACBLITZER.
AND DON'T YOU ROLL YOUR EYES ATME, YOUNG MAN.
NOW GO CLEAN YOUR SITUATION ROOMOR YOUR FATHER AND I WILL TAKE
AWAY YOUR BEARD TRIMMER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I NEVER, IN ALL MY YEARS--FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'M
WITH WOLF BLITZER ON THIS ONE.
AS JOURNALISTS IT IS OUR SACREDDUTY TO FACE THOSE IN AUTHORITY
AND ASK SHOULD WE REALLY KNOWTHIS?
THE POINT IS I DON'T WANT TOLEARN WHAT'S IN THIS REPORT.
WHEN WE RETURN, I'M GOING TOLEARN WHAT'S IN THIS REPORT WHEN
I'M JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR OFTHE NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHIVE AT
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,TOM BLANTON.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
