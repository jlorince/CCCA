OF COURSE, THERE HAS BEEN
WALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE OF THESE
TERRORIST ATTACKS ALL WEEK
BECAUSE THE MEDIA LOVES
REPORTING BAD NEWS.
I BACK THAT UP WITH DETAILS BUT
OUR FACT CHECKER WAS HIT BY A
A BUS CARRYING MEDICINE TO AN
ORPHANAGE FOR PUPPIES AND
WHEELCHAIRS.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT TONIGHT, I AM HERE TO TELL
YOU TO BUCK UP, AMERICA.
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW
AMERICANS WHO STILL HAS A BUCK
BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR TINY
TRIUMPHS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOLKS, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF
CIVIL ENGINEERS RECENTLY
RELEASED THEIR QUADRENNIAL
REPORT CARD, AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 15 YEARS WE IMPROVED OUR
GRADE.
IN 2009, THEY GAVE OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE A
D, BUT THIS YEAR WE HAVE
ROCKETED UP TO D-PLUS.
BOOM!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE ARE CLIMBING THE LADDER.
( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, DO NOT CLIMB THAT
LADDER.
IT IS A DEATH TRAP.
FOLKS, THIS REPORT, WHICH GIVES
A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF A
NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
RELEASED IN MARCH, BUT I JUST
GOT IT BECAUSE THE DELIVERY
TRUCK SPENT FOUR DAYS STUCK IN A
POTHOLE.
( LAUGHTER )
BE PROUD, NATION.
BECAUSE WE HAVE BOOSTED OUR
GRADE IN ALL 16 INFRASTRUCTURE
SUBJECTS, EXCEPT FOR 10 OF THEM.
( LAUGHTER ).
FOR MORE, WE TURN TO THE FIRST
NAME IN CRUMBLING, CNN.
JIM.
>> SIX CATEGORIES SAW
IMPROVEMENT.
BRIDGES, RAILROADS, DRINKING
WATER, SOLID WASTE, AND
WASTEWATER.
SOLID WASTE EARNED THE HIGHEST
GRADE ON THE REPORT, A B-MINUS--
GO, SOLID WASTE.
( APPLAUSE )
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen:  YES, YES.
GO SOLID WASTE.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, TUCKER
CARLSON IS THE NEW HOST OF "FOX
& FRIENDS WEEKEND."
GO, TUCKER.
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, WE CAN
NOW PROUDLY SAY THAT ONLY 25% OF
OUR NATION'S BRIDGES ARE
STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT OR
FUNCTIONALLY OBSOLETE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE IS A THREE-IN-FOUR CHANCE
IF YOU DRIVE ACROSS A BRIDGE,
YOU WILL MAKE IT TO THE OTHER
SIDE.
AND AMERICA CAN HOLD ITS HEAD
HIGH, KNOWING WHEN IT COMES TO
OUR NATION'S LEVEES, 8% ARE IN
ACCEPTABLE CONDITION.
OF THE REMAINING LEVEES, 22% ARE
UNACCEPTABLE, 42% ARE
CONSTRUCTED OF OLD MARSHMALLOW
PEEPS, AND 28% DON'T WANT TO
WORK.
THEY JUST WANT TO BANG ON THE
DRUM ALL DAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NATION, I BELIEVE THIS INSPIRING
D-PLUS IS A GRADE WE CAN ALL BE
PROUD OF.
IN FACT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD
HANG THIS REPORT CARD SOMEWHERE
HIGH WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.
BUT NOT A BRIDGE.
( LAUGHTER )
IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE
LOAD.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT KEEP THOSE PARTY HATS ON,
NATION, BECAUSE I'VE GOT MORE
GOOD NEWS TO REPORT.
AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AGENCY STUDY SAYS THAT MORE THAN
HALF OF U.S. RIVERS ARE UNABLE
TO SUSTAIN LIFE.
BUT I AM AN OPTIMIST.
I PREFER TO SEE OUR NATION'S
RIVERS AS HALF NOT A
PHOSPHOROUS-SOAKED-AQUATIC
GRAVEYARD.
AND THIS SUMMER YOU CAN HAVE
JUST AS MUCH FUN IN A SO-CALLED
POLLUTED RIVER.
NO TIRE SWING?
JUST JUMP IN AND CHANCES ARE
YOU'LL LAND ON ONE.
IF ONLY 45% OF OUR RIVERS AND
STREAMS CAN SUPPORT LIFE, I'LL
SAY THE PROBLEM ISN'T WITH THE
WATER, IT'S WITH THE FISH.
HEY, IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE
HEAT, GET OUT OF THE WATER THAT
FOR SOME REASON IS ON FIRE.
( LAUGHTER ).
SO CHEER UP, NATION.
THESE TWO REPORTS SHOW THAT
WE'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
EVEN IF A BRIDGE DOES COLLAPSE,
CHANCES ARE THE RIVER WILL BE SO
POLLUTED, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
DRIVE RIGHT ACROSS IT.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS )
