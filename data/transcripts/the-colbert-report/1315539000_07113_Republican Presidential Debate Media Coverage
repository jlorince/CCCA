[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] WOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH
NATION, I KNOW WE IN THE NEWS
MEDIA HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THIS 2012 ELECTION SINCE 2010,
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT MONDAY WAS LABOR DAY, WHEN
WE TRADITIONALLY PUT AWAY OUR
WHITE PANTS AND TAKE OUT OUR
WHITE CANDIDATES.
JIM?
>> LABOR DAY TRADITIONALLY
THE KICKOFF TO CAMPAIGN
SEASONth LABOR DAY KICKS OFF
THE FALL CAMPAIGN SEASON.
>> LABOR DAY WEEKEND KICKS OFF
AN INTENSE, HIGH STAKES A
COMPLAIN SEASON.
>> IT'S SIGNALED THE START OF
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SEASON.
>> Stephen: YEAH, I ADMIT IT.
ALL THE COVERAGE UP TILL NOW HAS
BEEN (bleep).
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WATCHED!
BUT I SWEAR THAT FROM HERE ON
OUT, EVERY SECOND OF THE MEDIA'S
COVERAGE IS CRUCIAL, LIFE OR
DEATH STUFF!
[ LAUGHTER ]
CASE IN POINT, MSNBC'S BROADCAST
OF LAST NIGHT'S REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AT THE
RONALD REAGAN LIBRARY, WHERE THE
WALLS ARE TASTEFULLY PAINTED
WITH THE BLOOD OF NICARAGUAN
CONTRAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THE CANDIDATES STOOD
bENEATH THE AIR FORCE ONE THAT
RONALD REAGAN USED TO PERSONALLY
PILOT STEERING WITH HIS BALLS.
FOR THE RECORD, THE REAGAN
LIBRARY IS THE ONLY ONE WHERE
YOU CAN CHECK OUT A 747.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU JUST HAVE TO STAMP THE
SIGN-OUT CARD ON THE TAIL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLKS, THIS DEBATE WAS SO
IMPORTANT THAT I DID SOMETHING
MOST AMERICANS WOULD BE ASHAMED
TO ADMIT:
I WATCHED MSNBC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T LOOK
DIRECTLY AT THE SCREEN.
LIKE A SOLAR ECLIPSE, I WATCHED
THROUGH A PINHOLE IN A PIECE OF
CARDBOARD -- WHICH PROJECTED ON
YOUR HAND LIKE THAT WATCH HERE
LIKE THAT
WHICH HAD THE ADDED BENEFIT OF
NOT BLINDING ME WHEN nEWT
GINGRICH'S HEAD BLOTTED OUT THE
SUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOLKS, THIS DEBATE PROVED
ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE COULD BE
A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN
lAME-DUCK FAIL-BAMA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TRADEMARK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, JUST LOOK AT THE MAN I USED
TO ENDORSE BEFORE HE CANCELLED
COMING ON MY SHOW:  HERMAN CAIN.
THE CAIN TRAIN DELIVERED A BOLD
IDEA ON HOW TO FIX SOCIAL
SECURITY.
>> SOCIAL SECURITY, IT NEEDS
FIXING, NOT CONTINUING TO TALK
ABOUT IT.
I BELIEVE IN THE CHILEAN MODEL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Stephen: NOW, I HAVE TO
ADMIT, I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE
CHILEAN MODEL.
SO I PUT THE WORDS "CHILEAN
MODEL" INTO GOOGLE IMAGES, AND
LET ME TELL YOU, I LIKED WHAT I
SAW.
VERY FIRM PLANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND CAIN WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WITH GREAT IDEAS.
LISTEN TO TEXAS CONGRESSMAN AND
DEADWOOD ANGRY TOWNSMAN RON
PAUL.
>> DO YOU ADVOCATE GETTING RID
OF THE MINIMUM WAGE?
WOULD THAT CREATE
