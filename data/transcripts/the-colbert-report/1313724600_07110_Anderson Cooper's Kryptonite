>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, FOLKS T IS NO SECRET
THAT I HAVE HAD A LONG TIME
BEEF WITH MY RIVAL CNN WOOD
ELF ANDERSON COOPER.
I CANNOT STAND ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THOSE EYES.
THEY ARE THE EXACT BENJAMIN
MOORE COLOR I PAINTED MY
MASTER BATH.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THAT WHERE THE
ADMIRATION ENDS, FOLKS
BECAUSE AS YOU RECALL NOT
LONG AGO I CALLED OUT
MR. 360-- 360 FOR RIPPING
OFF MY ON NOTICE BOARD WITH
HIS SEGMENT THE RIDICULIST
AND AS PUNISHMENT I ADDED
HIM TO MY ABSURDUCHART.
THE ABSURDUCHART IS TO YOU
GUARDED AT ALL TIMES BY A
PLA TYP US IN A BIRTHDAY
HAT.
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WHY.
NOW I HAVE TO ADMIT I HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN INTIMIDATED BY
ANDERSON COOPER'S LEGENDARY
KPOTIONURE UNDER PRESSURE.
BUT I THINK WE HAVE FINALLY
FOUND ANDERSON'S WEAKNESS.
CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST
NIGHT WHILE HE WAS REPORTING
ON FRENCH ACTOR GERARD
DEPARDIEU'S RECENT MELTDOWN
WHEN HE PEED IN THE AISLE OF
AN AIRPLANE.
JIM?
>> SO ACTOR GERARD TOOK HIS
LITTLE SOLO FLIGHT TO
URINATION, THE PLANE HAD TO
TURN AROUND AND GO BACK TO
THE GATE AND SOME UNLICKY
CLEANING CREW HAD TO DEAL
WITH THE.
ALL I CAN SAY THEY SHOULD
THANK THEIR LUCKY STARS IT
WASN'T DEPARTFEW.
SORRY.
THAT MADE ME GIGGLE EVERY
TIME I READ IT.
(LAUGHTER)
DEPARTTWO.
I KNOW YOU GOT IT BUT
BUT-- (GIGGLING).
>> SORRY.
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY THIS HAS ACTUALLY
NEVER HAPPENED TO ME.
>> Stephen: I AM SHOCKED!
I AM SHOCKED AT THIS
BEHAVIOR FROM THE
AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST WHO
STAYS POISED WHILE REPORTING
DURING A HURRICANE, VISITING
AN EARTHQUAKE RAVAGED
HELLSCAPE, FENDING OFF
RIOTERS IN TAHRIR SQUARE,
BEING ATTACKED BY A
HYPOGRIFF AND RIDING HIS
SURFBOARD THROUGH SPACE.
BUT WE HAVE FOUND ANDERSON
COOPER'S KRYPTON IDENTITY.
CELEBRITY POOP PUNS.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, ANDERSON, IF
DEPART-TWO TICKLED YOUR
FUNNY BONE I'M ABOUT TO SLIT
YOUR JOKE-ULAR VEIN.
