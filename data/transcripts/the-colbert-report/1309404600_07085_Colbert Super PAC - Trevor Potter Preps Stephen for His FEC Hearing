I WILL ALSO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS.
[LAUGHTER]
HERE TO PREP ME FOR MY HISTORIC
TESTIMONY IS FORMER CHAIR OF THE
FEC AND MY PERSONAL LAWYER,
TREVOR POTTER.
TREVOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING ON.
GOOD TOLL SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SHOULD I BRING THIS WITH ME
TOMORROW?
>> VERY BAD IDEA.
>> Stephen: VERY BAD IDEA.
OKAY.
FIRST OF ALL, I COULD NOT BE
MORE EXCITED TO GO DOWN AND
TESTIFY BEFORE THE FEC.
THEY LOVE IT IN WASHINGTON WHEN
I TESTIFY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S A VERY WELCOMING TOWN THAT
WAY.
>> I'VE HEARD THAT.
>> Stephen: WHAT CAN I EXPECT
TOMORROW?
HOW IS IT GOING TO GO DOWN?
>> IT'S A HEARING ROOM WITH A
HORSESHOE SHAPED TABLE.
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, YEAH.
>> YOU ARE DOWN BELOW WHERE YOU
SHOULD BE.
>> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
>> THE STAFF WILL INTRODUCE THE
DRAFT ADVISORY OPINIONS AND THEY
WILL DISCUSS THEM AMONGST
THEMSELVES AND THEY MAY HAVE
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.
THEY MAY NOT IN WHICH CASE YOU
JUST SIT THERE.
THEY MAY WANT TO ASK YOU
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOU ARE
GOING TO RUN YOUR PAC, IF YOU
HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF
PAC, THAT SORT OF THING.
>> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW ANY
OF THAT UNTIL I HAVE A PAC
RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHY KNOW GIVE ME A
PAC AND WE'LL FIND OUT.
TREV, HOW MUCH EXCITEMENT IS
THERE DOWN THERE ABOUT MY
APPEARANCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE?
>> WELL, THIS IS AN UNUSUAL
SITUATION.
I'M TOLD THAT THERE WILL ARE
PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREET IN
FRONT OF THE BUILDING TONIGHT
AND I DON'T THINK THAT HAS
HAPPENED BEFORE AT THE
COMMISSION.
>> Stephen: SO REALLY PEOPLE
HAVE NOT CAMPED OUT AHEAD OF
TIME TO HEAR DECISIONS ABOUT THE
FEC BEFORE.
>> AMAZINGLY THIS IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT AGENCY WORKS WITH
USUALLY ABOUT TWO PEOPLE IN THE
AUDIENCE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: WELL, THEY SHOULD
THANK ME.
[LAUGHTER]
ARE WE CHARGING THEM ANYTHING
FOR THIS?
A GET A LOT FOR PERSONAL
APPEARANCES.
[LAUGHTER]
TOMORROW, WILL WE FIND OUT WHAT
THE RULING IS?
>> YOU WILL.
THIS IS AN OPEN GOVERNMENT
PROCESS.
>> Stephen: AS GOVERNMENT
ALWAYS IS.
[LAUGHTER]
NONCH CLOSED HEARING ROOM.
NO CIGARS.
THEY'LL SIT THERE IN PUBLIC.
THEY'LL HAVE THEIR DISCUSSION,
VOTE AND RAISE THEIR HANDS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT IN FRONT OF
ME.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: IF ANY OF THEM
HESITATE TO VOTE FOR ME, CAN I
DO THIS?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD HELP
YOUR CAUSE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
BUT WE WILL GET AN ANSWER
TOMORROW?
>> YES, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
THEY SAY YES OR NO.
>> ACTUALLY NO.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE EITHER.
THEY COULD SPLIT 3-3 HAVE A TIE
VOTE.
>> Stephen: AND THEN I HAVE TO
FIGHT ONE OF THEM?
SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME SNL WHAT
HAPPENS THEN?
>> IT'S MORE DISCREET.
THEY'LL SEND YOU A LETTER THAT
SAYS WE AGREED ON ANSWERS 1, 2,
3.
WE WERE UNABLE TO REACH A
CONCLUSION ON ANSWER 4 BY A TIE
VOTE SO WE CAN'T TELL YOU.
>> Stephen: THEY MIGHT SAY WE
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU AT
THIS TIME?
>> THAT IS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME.
>> Stephen: CAN I TAKE THAT AS
A YES AND DO WHATEVER I WANT.
IF MOM DOESN'T TELL ME I CAN'T
HAVE A COOKIE, I'M EATING THE
WHOLE JAR.
>> THE LAW SAYS WITHOUT
PERMISSION YOU CAN'T BE
PROTECTED FROM SOME SORT OF FEC
INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION.
>> Stephen: IS THERE ANY
CHANCE THAT I COULD GET IN
TROUBLE TOMORROW?
I'M ASKING, DID THE FEC -- CAN
THEY GIVE ME THE DEATH PENALTY?
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO.
THEY ONLY HAVE CIVIL AUTHORITY.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.
>> Stephen: THEY CAN'T CLAP ME
IN JAIL FOR ANYTHING I DO
TOMORROW?
>> THEY CAN'T.
>> Stephen: THEN WE'RE GOING
