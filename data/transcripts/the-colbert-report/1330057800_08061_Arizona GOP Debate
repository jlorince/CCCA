PLEASE.
WONDERFUL.
AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO
ESTONIA.
IT'S A TINY COUNTRY WITH A
GOOD PR DEPARTMENT.
FOLKS, LAST NIGHT WAS THE
20th GOP PRESIDENTIAL
DEBATE.
LAST NIGHT'S BIG WINNER WAS
MITT ROMNEY.
WHO SLAPPED DOWN RICK
SANTORUM'S ACCUSATION THAT
ROMNEYCARE IS WHAT LEAD TO
OBAMACARE.
JUST WATCH MITT SLIP THE
SCRIPT.
>> THE REASON WE HAVE
OBAMACARE IS BECAUSE THE
SENATOR SUPPORTED PAT TOOMEY
ARE OVER PAT TOOMEY ARLEN
SPECTER VOTED FOR OBAMACARE.
IF YOU HAD NOT SUPPORTED HIM,
IF WE SAID NO TO ARLEN
SPECTER WE WOULD NOT HAVE
OBAMACARE.
SO DON'T LOOK AT ME.
TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
>> Stephen: YEAH, RICK.
IF YOU DIDN'T ENDORSE THIS
CLOWN IN 2004 WHO CAST THE
DECIDING VOTE ON OBAMACARE
FIVE YEARS LATER, WE
WOULDN'T HAVE OBAMA'S
DISASTROUS GOVERNMENT
MANDATED HEALTH CARE THAT
MITT ROMNEY DESIGNED.
(LAUGHTER)
SO LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
BUDDY!
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE
WHAT YOU SEE.
BUT WHAT REALLY--
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT REALLY SEALED MITT'S
VICTORY WAS HIS ANSWER TO
JOHN KING'S FINAL QUESTION.
>> WHAT THE BIGGEST
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT YOU IN
THE PUBLIC DEBATE RIGHT NOW.
WE ARE GEEING HAVE TO ADD
DRAMATIC FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE
IN WASHINGTON D.C.
WE'RE GOING HAVE TO CREATE
MORE JOBS V LESS DEBT AND
SHRINK THE SIZE OF
GOVERNMENT.
THE ONLY PERSON --
>> ARE THERE MISCONCEPTION,
THE QUESTION IS A
MISCONCEPTION.
>> YOU GET TO ASK THE
QUESTIONS YOU WANT, I GET TO
GIVE THE ANSWERS I WANT.
>> FAIR ENOUGH.
>> Stephen: YES, WAIT WITH
WAY TO GO, MITT.
BOOM BOOM.
YOU CAN GIVE WHATEVER
ANSWERS YOU WANT WHO CARES
WHAT THE QUESTION WAS.
(LAUGHTER)
I LOVE THIS!
I WANT TO TRY.
OKAY.
JIMMY, HIT ME WITH ONE OF
LAST NIGHT'S QUESTIONS.
>> WHY WAS GEORGE W. BUSH
WRONG IN HIS EFFORTS TO SAVE
THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND WHY
WAS BARACK OBAMA WRONG TO
CONTINUE THE EFFORT.
>> LINCOLN.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE THE QUESTION I'M
ANSWERING IS WHAT IS THE
CAPITAL OF NEBRASKA.
OKAY, I'M GOOD AT THIS.
I'M GOOD AT THIS GIVE ME
ANOTHER.
>> MY QUESTION TO ALL THE
CANDIDATES IS HOW DO YOU
PLAN ON DEALING WITH THE
GROWING NUCLEAR THREAT IN
IRAN.
>> HE WAS STABBED WITH AN
ICICLE AND IT MELTED.
OKAY, I'M ON A ROLL.
I'M ON A ROLL.
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
TO BRING DOWN THE DEBT?
>> TUB THUMPING BY
CHUMBAWUMBA.
THE PEOPLE KNOW!
THIS GIVES HOPE TO ALL OF
US.
PRESIDENT ROMNEY WILL MAKE
US GREAT AGAIN.
IMAGINE HOW WELL OUR KIDS
WILL DO ON TESTS.
WHAT IS THE QUAD RATIC
EQUATION.
ANSWER, ONCE AT CAMP BUT I
DIDN'T LIKE IT.
NOW YOU MAY ASK, YOU MAY ASK
IF MITT DOESN'T WANT TO
ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHY DID
HE AGREE TO A DEBATE TO
WHICH I SAY
