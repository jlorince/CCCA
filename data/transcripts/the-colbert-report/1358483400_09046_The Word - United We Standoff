PUT DOWN THE SUNNY D AND FIRE UP THE UNDERWOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANKFULLY, FOLKS, OUR CONSTITUTION HAS A BUILT-IN MECHANISM TO STOP DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED TYRANTS FROM TAKING OUR GUNS AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
UNITED WE STAND OFF.
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS ANTI-GUN STORM TROOPERS SAY IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO HAVE A PISTOL.
IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO HAVE A RIFLE AND A SHOTGUN.
BUT IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ME TO HAVE MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONRY.
MAYBE THEY'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS.
>> THE FOUNDERS FEARED GOVERNMENT TYRANNY.
>> THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS ABOUT RESISTANCE TO GOVERNMENT TYRANNY.
>> THEY NEVER MENTIONED HUNTING AND DEER, THEY TALKED ABOUT FREEDOM AND LIBERTY OVER TYRANNY.
>> Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT.
LIKE ANYBODY SETTING UP A NEW GOVERNMENT THE FOUNDERS ADDED A CLAUSE THAT SAID IF YOU DON'T
LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING, FEEL FREE TO SHOOT US.
IT'S LIKE --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS LIKE THE ULTIMATE VETO.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CONSTITUTIONAL PRENUP.
THAT IS WHY I AND MY FRIENDS AT FOX NEWS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD WITH THOSE WHO ARM THEMSELVES AGAINST
GOVERNMENT TYRANNY, PATRIOTS LIKE BILL AND THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T GET ME WRONG, ITS FOUNDERS DIDN'T -- THE FOUNDERS DIDN'T WANT US TO ENGAGE IN ARMED
INSURRECTION AT THE DROP OF A HAT, NO -- NO, THEY KNEW IT SHOULD BE ONLY IF SOMETHING
UNIMAGINABLE HAPPENED.
SOMETHING LIKE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TURNING ON ITS OWN CITIZENS.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED WEAPONS AND NOT SOME WEAK ASS TEN-ROUND MAGAZINES EITHER.
AS CNN CONSERVATIVE CONTRIBUTOR PUT IT YOU MAY THINK A 30 ROUND MAGAZINE IS TOO BIG.
UNDER THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT A 30 ROUND MAGAZINE MIGHT BE TOO SMAWSM
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
WHEN THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS WRITTEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A STANDING ARMY AND THE MOST
POWERFUL WEAPON IN AMERICA'S ARSENAL WAS THE HORSE DRAWN SMALL POX BLANKET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT TODAY -- BUT FOLKS -- TODAY AMERICA HAS THE WORLD'S GREATEST MILITARY FULL OF BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN ARMED WITH THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPONRY EVER DEVISED.
IT'S BECAUSE I RESPECT OUR TROOPS SO MUCH THAT I NEED A FULLY AUTOMATICALLY ASSAULT
RIFLE WITH A 100 ROUND MAGAZINE TO KILL THEM WHEN THEY COME FOR MY GUNS.
BECAUSE REALISTICALLY --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- JUST THINK ABOUT THIS:  YOU THINK THAT AR-15 IS GOING TO SAVE YOU WHEN UNCLE COMES
KNOCKING WITH AN APACHE HELICOPTER?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, NOW IF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS TRULY TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST GOVERNMENT COURSE, THEN
CITIZENS WILL NEVER BE SAFE UNTIL WE CAN HAVE OUR OWN AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, I KNOW WHAT SOME OUT THERE ARE SAYING, MIGHT SOME DERANGED INDIVIDUAL TAKE THEIR
CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED AIRCRAFT CARRIER TO A MALL LET'S SAY AND RAIN HELL FIRE MISSILES
DOWN ON A CINNABON FOR SKIMPING ON THE FROSTING?
WELL, OF COURSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S NO STOPPING THAT.
BUT AS JEFFERSON SAID SOMETIMES THE TREE OF LIBERTY MUST BE WATERED BY THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT.
LOOK IT UP.
SO MR. KING PRESIDENT, UNLESS YOU AND THE ANTI-GUN BRIGADE WILL ADMIT THAT WE GUN OWNERS
ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED THE RIGHT TO HAVE ANY WEAPON WE WANT, WE'LL USE EVERY WEAPON WE
CAN GET TO KEEP EVERY WEAPON WE HAVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
