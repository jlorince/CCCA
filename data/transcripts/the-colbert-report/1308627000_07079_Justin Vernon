>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WROTE AND REPORTED HIS LAST ALBUM IN A REMOTE CABIN GIVING HIM THE
ULTIMATE INDY CRED.
I WILL TRY TO GET HIM TO HOLD A CAN OF DR PEPPER.
PLEASE WELCOME FROM THE BAND BON IVER JUSTIN VERNON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANKS FOR COME ON.
I'M A BIG FAN, NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WE'LL GET PAST IT QUICKLY BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU MUST BE
TIRED OF THE LEGEND OF BON IVER.
YOU GOT SICK, YOU GOT LEPROSY OR SOMETHING AND YOU HAD TO GO TO A CABIN IN
WISCONSIN AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.
TO THE FOR ME, I WOULD LOVE TO YOU DRAG IT OUT BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE TIDE OF PEOPLE
ASKING THIS QUESTION.
>> RIGHT, WELL, I GOT SICK AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND MY DAD HAD A CABIN AND I
WENT THERE AND RECORDED MY RECORD.
I WAS KIND OF-- I WAS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND OUT.
>> Stephen: DOESN'T SOUND AS LEGENDARY AS I THOUGHT.
>> HE RECORDED THIS ALL UP AND SAID MAYBE WE CAN SELL THESE SONGS AND EVERYBODY
GOES NO, THIS IS FANTASTIC.
WHAT WAS THE ILLNESS.
>> MONO.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> NOT NOW.
>> Stephen: BUT THEN YOU HAD IT.
AND YOU HAD TO KIND OF STAY CALM AND STILL, BASICALLY FOR A FEW MONTHS.
>> YOU WANT TO SLEEP A LOT.
>> Stephen: DID THAT INFLUENCE THE US MUSIC ON THAT ALBUM.
LIKE IF YOU HAD HAD SOMETHING ELSE LIKE ST.
VITUS DANCE, WOULD YOU HAVE DONE A CLUB ALBUM INSTEAD.
>> SURE.
NO, I MEAN, I THINK JUST BEING ALONE AND HAVING TO KIND OF BE IN 1 PLACE AND NOT REALLY TRAVEL OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT KIND OF MADE ME BE DISTILLED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE RECORD I
NEEDED TO MAKE, I GUESS, YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: NOW THIS ALBUM,
YOU MADE FOREVER AGO REACHED SOMEPLACE DEEP AND I GOT TO SAY KIND OF PAINFUL IN ME.
AND I'M HOPING THE SECOND ALBUM WILL NOT DO THAT.
IS IT DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT WAS-- YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE IMAGERY WASING ANICING.
>> IT IS A LITTLE MORE COLOURFUL IT IS A LOFTIER,
LESS KIND OF LAYING WITH YOUR FACE ON THE FLOOR.
BUT YEAH, IT'S HAPPIER.
YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF THIS TIME AROUND.
>> FANTASTIC.
>> NOW IS YOUR AUDIENCE MOSTLY MEN OR WOMEN BECAUSE MY WIFE HER HOT YOGA CLASS
LISTENS TO YOUR ALBUM.
WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE DOWNWARD PIGEON.
>> YOU KNOW.
YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY SAD YOGA CLASS.
>> IT IS.
I THINK SKINNY LOVE IS INSPIRING.
>> IT'S LIKE A DIET SONG.
>> HOW MUCH YOU CAN BURNOFF IN THIS HOUR.
>> JUST ANGST.
>> YEAH.
>> AND DO YOU HAVE LIKE YOU'RE BIG WITH THE LADIES,
SENSITIVE, RIGHT.
>> SURE.
>> ARE YOU WERE ACTUALLY A WOMEN'S STUDIES MAJOR.
>> YEAH, YEAH, WAY BACK IN THE DAY.
>> WHY?
>> WHO WAS SHE IS WHAT I AM ASKING.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I MEAN BACK IN '99 WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE I THINK I WAS STUDYING PHILOSOPHY.
I WASN'T READY TO STUDY MUSIC AND I JUST, YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD AND THERE'S 50%
OR MORE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FEMALE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING'S KIND OF A BOY'S CLUB.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WEIRD THAT THAT WAS THE CASE AND IT WAS MY MINOR.
IT WASN'T MY MAJOR.
>> YOUR MAJOR WAS.
>> RELIGIOUS STUDIES.
>> SO RELIGION AND WOMEN'S STUDIES.
DID YOU JUST GO INTO THE REGISTRAR AND SAY JUST MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY.
>> YEAH, YEAH, BASICALLY.
(APPLAUSE)
>> OKAY, NOW-- THE ALBUM,
THE ALBUM, THE SELF-TITLED ALBUM WHICH I BELIEVE IS, BY THE WAY, INCREDIBLY
EGOISTICAL, BON IVER DROPS TOMORROW.
AND BON IVER, IS THAT BON IVER.
>> BONIVER.
>> OKAY.
AND WHAT IS THAT, SHORT FOR BONATHON, WHAT DOES IT MEAN.

THE NAME OF THE PROJECT.
>> THE PROJECT.
>> OKAY.
