NAME IS NOW SMON MOUSE WITH EXCELLENCE.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, LAST NIGHT MITT ROMNEY CRUSHED RICK SANTORUM IN WASHINGTON, D.C., MARYLAND AND
THE IMPORTANT SWING STATE OF WISCONSIN.
AND THIS CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.
>> THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN DO THE MATH AND SEE ANY OTHER RESULT.
MITT ROMNEY WILL BE THE NOMINEE.
>> THE RACE, LIKE I SAID, FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES IS OVER.
>> LET'S BE HONEST, IT'S PROBABLY BEEN OVER FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
NOW WE CAN SAY IT WITH MORE AUTHORITY.
IT'S OVER.
ANYBODY WHO PRETENDS OTHERWISE IS TRYING TO MAKE GOOD T.V.
>> AND WILLIE GEIST KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TRY TO MAKE GOOD T.V.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NATION, WE HAVE FINALLY ACHIEVED A NATIONAL GROUNDSWELL OF
MITT-THUSIASM AND WE MUST UNITE BEHIND ONE CANDIDATE SO WE CAN PLUMMET TOWARD VICTORY IN
NOVEMBER NOW, IS MITT THE BEST CANDIDATE?
NO.
IS HE THE TRUE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE?
UH-UH.
(LAUGHTER) BUT HE IS THE MOST CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER) AND I BELIEVE WITH SOME OF MY HEART THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER SOMEONE SHOULD RUN.
(LAUGHTER) AND IT APPEARS THAT MITT IS.
THEREFORE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MUST BE-- ANYBODY ELSE JUMPING IN?
NO.
DID YOU CHECK?
LAST CHANCE.
OKAY.
MITT ROMNEY!
WHOO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
