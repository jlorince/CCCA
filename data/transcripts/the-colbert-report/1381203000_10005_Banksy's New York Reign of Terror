WELL, THERE'S ONE SO-CALLEDPAINTER THAT I HAVE A SERIOUS
BEEF WITH.
THE GUY WHO PAINTED THIS STUFF.
BRITISH GUERRILLA GRAFFITIISTBANKSY, AN ANONYMOUS STREET
ARTIST NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN.
WELL, FOLKS, BRACE YOURSELFBECAUSE THE BRITISH ARE COMING,
THE BRITISH ARE COMING.
>> BANKSY ANNOUNCED ON HIS WEBSITE HE'S TAKING UP RESIDENCY IN
NEW YORK THIS MONTH LAUNCHING ASERIES OF WORKS CALLED "BETTER
OUT THAN IN."
THE FIRST WORK APPEARED ON ALANSTREET NEAR CANAL.
IT SHOWS A CHILD HOLDING A CANOF SPRAY PAINT STANDING ON
ANOTHER CHILD'S BACK BELOW ASIGN THAT READS "GRAS FEET CITY
A CRIME."
>> Stephen: GRAFFITI IS A CRIME.
SO, NATION, CALL THE POLICE IFYOU SEE THIS MAN.
(LAUGHTER)NOW, FOLKS, I HAVE GOT
ABSOLUTELY ZERO RESPECT FOR THISELUSIVE LIMEY STREET RAT.
HE'S ANONYMOUS AND HIS ART ISPUBLIC SO THE JERK DOESN'T EVEN
PROFIT OFF OF IT.
(LAUGHTER)ART BELONGS IN ONE OF TWO
PLACES: A MUSEUM OR MOUNTED NEARTHE TOILET IN A BILLIONAIRE'S
YACHT.
(LAUGHTER)MONET'S WATER LILIES REALLY GETS
THE FLOW GOING.
NOW, FOR SOME REASON, THE ARTWORLD IS ENAMORED BY THIS
CRIMINAL AND ANY WALL HE PAINTSON IS TORN DOWN AND AUCTIONED
OFF FOR MILLIONS.
FOLKS, THIS TERRIFIES ME.
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE LITTLE KNOWN FACT, MY
STUDIO HAS WALLS.
(LAUGHTER)AND BANKSY'S NEW YORK REIGN OF
TERROR DOES NOT END FOR 24 DAYSAND THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR
THE FRONT OF MY BUILDING TO BEVANDALIZED AND ITS PROPERTY
VALUE TO SKYROCKET.
(LAUGHTER)IN FACT, I AM SO CONCERNED I
HAVE THAT FRAMED OUT A SPECIFICAREA BANKSY IS FORBIDDEN TO
BEGRIME WITH HIS HOODLUMGRAFFITO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NO!
NO!
BANKSY, I KNOW IT'S TEMPTING ASAN ARTIST FOR YOU TO SEE THIS
NAKED WALL AND KNOW THAT IT'SOFF LIMITS FOR YOU TO INJECT ONE
OF YOUR TRADEMARK INCISIVE BITSOF SUBVERSIVE SOCIAL COMMENTARY
OR MAYBE JUST PAINT ME RIDING ASHARK.
(LAUGHTER)BUT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
SHOULD YOU USE THE SPRAY PAINTLEFT UNATTENDED ON THE SIDEWALK
BY MY MAINTENANCE STAFF.
THOSE WERE THROWN OUT ON MYORDERS.
AND DO NOT ENJOY THE SELECTIONOF TEA SANDWICHES AND ROOM
TEMPERATURE NEW CASTLE ALE.
(LAUGHTER)SO ONCE AGAIN, BANKSY, STAY AWAY
FROM MY STUDIO AT 1513 WEST 54thSTREET BETWEEN 10th AND 11th
ATTITUDE OR NEAR THE WEST SIDEHIGHWAY IF YOU'RE COMING BY CAR.
I'LL BE WATCHING FOR YOU BANKSY,EXCEPT BETWEEN 3:00 AND 4:00
