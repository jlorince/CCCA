AND AGAIN.
I SAY EVERYONE JUST NEEDD TO
RELAX.
THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM
MONSANTO'S GENETICALLY MODIFIED
UNKILLABLE MYSTERY WHEAT OR, AS
I CALL IT, MY AMBER WAVES
FRANKEN-GRAIN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SEE?
IT'S PERFECTLY FRIENDLY.
JUST DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN
MOVES.
HERE TO TELL US WHY MY WHEAT IS
NOT TO BE TRUSTED IS PULITZER
PRIZE WINNING SCIENCE JOURNALIST
FROM THE COUNCIL ON  OREIGN
RELATIONS, LAURIE GARRETT.
LAURIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
ME.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.
>> (LAUUHING)
Stephen: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, LAURIE, HOW DID THIS WHEAT
GET OUT?
DID IT TUNNEL OUT OF MMNSANTO
FROM BEHIND A RITA HAYWORTH
POSTER?
HOW DID IT GET INTO THE FIELD.
>> IN THE LATEST STATEMENT FROM
MONSANTO HINTED THAT IT MAY HAVE
-pBEEN SABOTAGED.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO TOOK THEIR WHEAT.
>> SUPPOSEDLY.
THAT'S WHAT MMNSANTO IS LEAKING,
THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE
CAUSE.
WE DON'T KNOW.
IT'S VERY STRANGE BECAUSE
THERE'S NO WAY SEEDS SHOULD
SURVIVE IN THE SOIL FOR  ORE
THAN A COUPLE OF YEARS
>> Stephen: HOW CAN SOMETHING
THAT THEY DIDN'T DEVELOP IN THE
LAST ALMOST NINE YEARS AT THIS
POINT, HOW COULD IT HAVE
SURVIVED?
IS IT DOING A RAMBO OUT THERE?
IS THE WHEAT LIVING OFF MUD
PUDDLES AND GRUBS SOME.
>> THE ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT
THERE ARE 24 STRAINS OF
SO-CALLED SUPER WHEATS.
THESE ARE GIANT WHEATS THAT ARE
VERY HARD TO KILL BECAUSE
GENESVE ABSORBED THESE STRANGE
>> Stephen: THERE'S A GENE IN
THERE THAT KEEPS ROUND-UP FROM
KILLING IT.
THAT CAN JUMP TO THE WEED IT'S
TRYING TO KILL?
>> EXACTLY
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KILL
THOSE WEEDS?
>> JUST THE WAY YOU KILLED
THESE.
>> Stephen: I DON'T THINK THESE
ARE DEAD YET.
NOW, ARE THE JAPANNESE RIGHT?
IS THERE A REASON TO NOT GET
THIS GRAIN?
IS THERE A DANGER?
>> IIDON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
DANGER TO HUMAN HEALTH.
>> Stephen: PEOPLE ARE CALLING
IT ZOMBIE WHEAT.
YOU KNOW.
IT'S THE RETURN OF THE WALKING
BREAD.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S JUST SCARE TACTICS?
>> LOOK, THE INTERESTING THING
IS THAT MONSANTO ACTUALLY COULD
BE COMPLETELY OPEN ABOUT THIS
ONE BECAUSE FARMER BARNES IN
KANSAS WHO FILED THE LAWSUIT...
>> Stephen: THERE'S A GUY IN
KANSAS WHO SAYS TTIS IS GOING TO
HURT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST JAPAN
BUT SOUTH KOREA.
EUROPE IS LOOKING TO CANCEL THE
SHIPMENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES
AND HE WAATS TO SUE MONSANTO FOR
THIS BREACH OF TRUST.
>> EXACTLY.
SENATOR ROY BLUNT WHO HAPPENS TO
BE FROM THE STATE THAT IS THE
HEADQUARTERS OF MONSANTO STUCK A
PARAGRAPH INTO THE BUDGET
RESOLUTION THAT IS CALLED THE
FARMERS ASSURANCE PROVIIION.
IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SUE
ISSUES.
>> Stephen: SO HOW LONG DOES
THAT LAST?
>> SIX MONTHS.
tephen: ARE WE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THAT RIGHT NOW?
>> IT WENT INTO EFFECT IN THE
MIDDLE OF MARCH
>> Stephen: THIS CROP THAT CAME
OUT OF NOWHERE AND THAT MONSANTO
SAYS THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT
CAME FROM JUST HAPPENED TO
APPEAR DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME
WHERE MONSANTT GOT A GET OUT OF
JAAL FREE CARD.
>> GO FIGURE.
Stephen: CAN I GET ONE OF
THOSE?
ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF GENETICALLY
MODIFIED FOODS OR ARE YOU
SOMEBODY WHO IS OPPOSED TO
GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND
BEFORE YOU ANSWER, PLEASE DON'T
SAY ANYTHING INSULTINGG
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MY WHEAT
ANGRY.
GUYS, GUYS, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
HERE IS SOME MEAT.
(GROWLING) YOU KNOW WHAT?
FOR SAFETY'S SAKE WE SHOULD JUST
GET GOING.
LAURIE GARRETT, EVERYBODY.
THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN
RELATIONS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
