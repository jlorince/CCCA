TONIGHT.
MY BAND TONIGHT IS OK GO.
I HOPE I DON'T CATCH DIGITAL HERPES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.
>> Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN FOUR YEARS.
>> IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
>> YOU GOING TO VISIT ME?
>> YOU'RE MORE FAMOUS THAN I AM.
>> Stephen: I'LL TAKE THAT.
HOW THE WORM HAS TURNED.
YOU HAVE A NEW ALBUM OUT.
IT'S YOUR THIRD "OF THE BLUE COLOR OF THE SKY."
>> YES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> IT'S HALF OF A TITLE OF AN 1876 BOOK CALLED "THE INFLUENCE
OF THE BLU-RAY OF SUNLIGHT AND OF THE BLUE COLOR OF THE SKY." THERE'S THIS RETIRED ARMY
GENERAL WHO WENT INTO SCIENCE AND BELIEVED HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT BLUE LIGHT IS THE CURE FOR
ALL DISEASES.
AND HE GOT A PATENT ON THE COLOR BLUE BECAUSE OF THIS.
>> Stephen: WOW.
MEGA BUCKS.
NOW, TALK ABOUT THE MEGA BUCKS.
YOU GUYS ARE ROCK STARS, BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE IN IT SO MUCH FOR THE CASH.
>> WELL, NO.
>> Stephen: YOU SEEM TO BE IN IT FOR THE ART.
>> WE ARE, WE ARE.
WE'RE VERY, VERY WEALTHY, BUT WE'RE...
[LAUGHTER]
>> Stephen: ROCK STARS.
OBVIOUSLY.
YOU FORMED YOUR OWN LABEL.
>> WE DID.
WE WERE ON MAJOR LABEL FOR MANY YEARS.
WE STARTED GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
WE DON'T CARE ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT RECORD SALES.
WE CARE ABOUT MAKING STUFF.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A TOUGH RETIREMENT PLAN.
BUT IF YOU'RE ARTISTS AND YOU'RE THE OWNERS OF THE LABEL, DOES
THE ARTIST PART OF YOU EVER HATE THE EXECUTIVE PART OF YOU?
LIKE DO YOU EVER COME OUT OF A MEETING ON ONE OF THE ALBUMS AND SAY, GOD, THOSE GUYS ARE DICKS?
>> YES, YEAH.
OR I MIGHT DECIDE TO SHELVE THIS RECORD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I
DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS ONE, GUYS.
I DON'T HEAR A SINGLE.
>> Stephen: I DO HEAR A SINGLE ON THIS ONE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: "THIS TOO SHALL PASS." TWO AMAZING VIDEOS.
YOU HAVE THE MARCHING BAND IN ONE VERSION.
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE GOLDBERG VERSION OF IT.
THE CREATORS OF THAT WERE...
>> THIN LAB IN LOS ANGELES.
>> Stephen: AND THE GUY WHO DESIGNED RUBE GOLDBERG TONIGHT WAS BRETT DOER.
UNBELIEVABLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU GUYS HAVE GOT AN INTERESTING THINGMENT YOU HAVE A SPONSOR FOR YOUR BAND.
>> WELL, WE HAD A SPONSOR FOR THAT RUBE GOLDBERG VIDEO.
>> Stephen: ONE THING I LOVED MOST ABOUT THAT VIDEO IS AT THE
END IT SAID, WE'D LIKE TO THANK STATE FARM.
I'VE HEARD ABOUT LIKE NERDY BEING HIP, BUT I'VE NEVER KNOWN
THAT JUST PLAIN BORING COULD BE HIP.
THIS IS A NEW LEVEL OF HIPNESS.
>> WELL, FOR YEARS ARTISTS HAVE NEEDED SPONSORSHIP TO MAKE THINGS, AND...
>> Stephen: MOZART HAD CARDINALS.
>> WE'VE BEEN TURNING TO MAJOR LABELS BECAUSE THEY HAD THE MONEY.
THEY START TO THINK THEY GOT TO MAKE THE ART.
SO THEY MADE ALL THE VIDEOS THE LAST 30 YEARS.
WE WANT TO MAKE OUR OWN VIDEOS.
>> Stephen: YOU GUYS HAVE GROUPIES?
>> OF COURSE.
>> Stephen: DO YOU EVER MAKE VIDEOS WITH THEM AND POST THEM?
YOU'D GET A LOT OF HITS.
[LAUGHTER]
