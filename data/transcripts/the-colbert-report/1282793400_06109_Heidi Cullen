>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A GLOBAL
WARMING ALARMIST WHO HAS WRITTEN
A BOOK CALLED "THE WEATHER OF
THE FUTURE."
MY FORECAST, SUNNY WITH CHANCE
OF NAILING.
MY GUEST, PLEASE WELCOME HEIDI
CULLEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MS. CULLEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON.
PLEASE, DON'T GET UP YOU'RE, A
LADY.
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.
NOW, MADAM, YOU ARE A SENIOR
RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT CLIMATE
CENTRAL, AND YOUR BOOK IS
"WEATHER OF THE FUTURE: HEAT
WAVE
, EXTREME STORMS AND OTHER
SCENES OF A CLIMATE-CHANGED
PLANET."
I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE, BUT
PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT CLIMATE
CHANGE ANYMORE.
YOU'VE SEEN THE POLLS, RIGHT?
THREE YEARS AGO EVERYONE'S LIKE,
AL GORE, CLIMATE CHANGE, GIVE
HIM AN OSCAR.
NOW WE'RE LIKE, EH.
>> THERE'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE
SUBJECT.
>> Stephen: I CARED ABOUT IT
THREE WEEKS AGO WHEN WE INVITED
YOU ON.
IT WAS VERY HOT.
NOW IT'S COOLER.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M WONDERING...
[APPLAUSE]
I'M WONDERING WHAT I WAS SCARED
ABOUT.
REFRIGHTEN ME.
REFRIGHTEN ME.
>> MY GOODNESS, THERE'S SO MANY
FRIGHTENING THINGS GOING ON
BETWEEN THE FLOODS IN PAKISTAN.
>> Stephen: NOT HERE, THOUGH.
>> THE HEAT WAVE.
>> Stephen: VERY SAD.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
>> THE HEAT WAVE IN RUSSIA.
30% OF THEIR WHEAT FIELD WAS
LOST DUE TO DROUGHT, TREMENDOUS
WILDFIRES.
IN A WAY WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING
NOW IS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE
FUTURE AND SORT OF HELP US PUT
INTO PERSPECTIVE WHAT CLIMATE
CHANGE WILL ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU SAY "WEATHER OF THE FUTURE."
YOU TALK A GOOD GAME, BUT YOU'RE
TALKING WEATHER OF THE FUTURE,
AND YOU'RE MODELING OUT TO 2050.
OKAY.
SAM CHAMPION ONLY GIVES ME A
TEN-DAY FORECAST.
OKAY.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOUR NAME DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE A WEATHER PATTERN.
YOUR NAME ISN'T STORM FIELDS OR
DALLAS RAINS OR LARRY SPRINKLE.
THOSE ARE REAL WEATHERMEN AND
THEY ONLY GIVE ME A TEN-DAY
FORECAST.
HOW CAN YOU MODEL OUT TO 2050?
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
>> Stephen: THANK YOU.
>> ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DO IS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN
CLIMATE WEATHER.
AND YOU SAID IT VERY, VERY WELL
WHERE YOU SAID CLIMATE IS
THOUSANDS OF LITTLE WEATHERS.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
>> ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT
IT IS CRIME IS WHAT YOU EXPECT,
WHETHER IS WHAT YOU GET.
NOW WITH GLOBAL WARMING, CLIMATE
IS WHAT WE EXPECT AND WEATHER IS
WHAT GETS IT, SO MORE EXTREME
FLOODS, MORE EXTREME DROUGHTS,
MORE EXTREME HEAT.
>> Stephen: BUT THESE DAYS
THAT'S VERY POPULAR.
THE KIDS WANT EVERYTHING TO BE
EXTREME, WOW.
YOU KNOW?
IT'S NOT JUST RAIN, IT'S
RAIIIIN.
IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE, MOTHER
[BLEEPED].
WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN?
WHAT'S THE TIDAL WAVE?
WHAT'S THE 2012 JERRY
BRUCKHEIMER DEATH SCENARIO OF
GLOBAL WARMING?
>> THERE'S MANY.
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS.
>> Stephen: NAME ONE.
NAME ONE.
>> OKAY.
FOR EXAMPLE, A PLACE LIKE BANK
OF
BANGLADESH, 25% OF THE COUNTRY
COULD BE INUNDATED DUE TO SEA
LEVEL RISE.
>> Stephen: SO 20% COVERED
WITH WATER?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE WE DISPLACING?
>> 15 PEOPLE -- 15 MILLION COULD
BE CLIMATE REFUGEES.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE
COULD WE FIT IN GREENLAND?
WHAT'S THAT HOLD?
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO
GET THEM THERE.
>> Stephen: COULDN'T WE JUST
SET THEM UP THERE?
>> I SUPPOSE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ARE WE GOING TO FIX THIS?
I BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE.
I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE
ANY ACTION.
[LAUGHTER]
>> OKAY.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY
SORT OF WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND IS
THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE
DO TODAY IN TERMS OF ADAPTING TO
THE FACT THAT OUR CLIMATE IS
CHANGING PAYS OFF IN THE LONG
RUN.
ONE ESTIMATE IS THAT FOR EVERY
$1 WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE
UPGRADES, IT PAYS UP BACK $4 IN
THE LONG RUN.
>> Stephen: FOR EVERY DOLLAR I
INVEST IN THE GREEN ENERGY
FUTURE, I GET FOUR BACK?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
PYRAMID SCHEME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HEIDI C
