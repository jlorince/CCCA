TIMES?
(LAUGHTER)
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO SAY THE WORLD IS GETTING
SAFER, WE CAN'T LET OUR FEAR OF
CRIME AND TERRORISTS CHANGE OUR
WAY OF LIFE.
HERE TO DEFEND THE "LET THEM
KILL US" VIEW IS NEUROSCIENTIST
AND AUTHOR OF "THE BETTER ANGELS
OF OUR NATURE: WHY VIOLENCE HAS
DECLINED" STEVEN PINKER.
MR. PINKER, THANKS FOR COMING
BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE BETTER
ANGELS OF OUR NATURE: WHY
VIOLENCE HAS DECLINED."
BEFORE WE GET STARTED, CAN YOU
PUT OUT YOUR ARMS, PLEASE?
(LAUGHTER)
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE
GOOD.
TK-PB FOE WHAT YOU WERE HIDING
UNDER THAT HELMET.
OKAY.
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WE ARE
SAFER?
9/11!
>> 9/11 WAS OFF THE CHARTS
3,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED EVERY
YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY ALONE,
16,000 PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY
ORDINARY HOMICIDES, 40,000
PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES, 3,000
PEOPLE DIE BY DROWNING, 300 OF
THEM IN BATHTUBS.
>> Stephen: WHY ISN'T THE
T.S.A. GIVING SPE A PONG BATH?
(LAUGHTER)
>> EVERY YEAR OTHER THAN 2001
MORE PEOPLE DIE FROM BEE STINGS,
PEANUT ALLERGIES, FROM
COLLISIONS ON HIGHWAYS WITH
DEER, FROM --
>> Stephen: YOU SAID OTHER
THAN 2001.
OTHER THAN 2001.
SO YOU'RE TAKING 9/11 OUT OF THE
MIX.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING THE GERMANS
KILLED VERY FEW JEWS-- EXCEPT
HITLER.
TAKE HITLER OUT OF THE MIX AND
THE GERMANS WERE LOVELY TO THE
JEWISH PEOPLE.
>> AFTER 2001 THERE WAS A
PREDICTION THAT WE'D HAVE 9/11S
EVERY MONTH.
THAT THERE WOULD BE SHOULDER
FIRED MISSILES THAT TAKE DOWN
PLANES, THAT THERE WOULD BE
BOMBS AS DISNEYWORLD, AT SUPER
BOWLS.
THAT PREDICTION HAS NOT COME TO
PASS.
>> Stephen: IT SEEMS LIKE WITH
THIS BOOK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
US TO CALM DOWN ABOUT OUR FEARS
BUT I SEE THINGS TO BE AFRAID OF
EVERYWHERE I LOOK.
DO DO YOU WATCH CABLE NEWS?
>> I DO.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU'LL BE MISLED
IF YOU BASE YOUR ASSESSMENT OF
HOW DANGEROUS THE WORLD IS ON
THE NEWS BECAUSE THE NEWS IS
ABOUT STUFF THAT HAPPENS.
ANYTHING THAT GOES BANG ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD THAT MAKES THE
NEWS.
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIE OF
NATURAL CAUSES DON'T HAVE A
REPORTER AND CAMERA CREW AT
THEIR BEDS.
THERE ARE MORE AND MORE OF THEM,
THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER
VIOLENT EVENTS BUT EVERY VIOLENT
EVENT THAT DOES HAPPEN MAKES THE
NEWS.
>> Stephen: I'LL GIVE YOU AN
EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT THE NEWS,
THIS IS REALITY, THAT VIPR
PROGRAM.
FOUR YEARS AGO IT WAS A $30
MILLION PROGRAM, NOW IT'S A $100
MILLION PROGRAM.
THAT SAYS TO ME THE WORLD GOT
$70 MILLION MORE DANGEROUS.
OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T BE THERE,
RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, THE SECURITY APPARATUS
DOESN'T DO COST-BENEFIT
CALCULATIONS, WE SPENT SOMETHING
LIKE A TRILLION DOLLARS SINCE
2001 ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND
RELATED EXPENSES BUT NOBODY DOES
THE MATH.
COULD WE HAVE MADE OURSELVES
MUCH SAFER SPENDING THAT
TRILLION DOLLARS IN OTHER WAYS?
>> Stephen: LIKE ALTERNATES TO
BATHING?
(LAUGHTER)
>> FOR EXAMPLE.
OR STOPPING PEOPLE WHO TEXT
WHILE THEY DRIVE.
>> Stephen: IF THE WORLD IS A
SAFER PLACE, WHY CAN I STILL
DIE?
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
UNTIL WE ARE IMMORTAL, SHOULDN'T
WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER NO
MATTER WHAT THE POWER TO KEEP
OURSELVES ALIVE FOREVER?
>> WE SHOULD.
THEN PREVENTING TERRORISTS
ATTACKS IS NOT A COST EFFECTIVE
WAY TO DO IT.
YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO DIE
IN A CAR ACCIDENT, FALLING OFF A
LADDER.
>> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE
DIE FROM FALLING OFF LADDERS.
>> THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR.
>> Stephen: SHOULD WE BE
INEVADING LADDERSTAN?
(LAUGHTER)
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> 20,000 DEATHS A YEAR FROM
ACCIDENTAL FALLS.
WE JUST READ ABOUT ONE IN A
STADIUM YESTERDAY.
MOST DON'T MAKE THE KNEW.
SOME GUY FALLS OFF A LADDER AND
DIES.
BUT YOU ADD THEM UP OVER THE
COURSE THE OF THE YEAR AND
YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GET
KILLED IN A HOUSEHOLD ACCIDENT
THAN A TERRORIST ATTACK.
>> Stephen: YOU SAID THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN
TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE NEWER THAN
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHOSE
PAJAMAS HAVE CAUGHT ON FIRE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> EVERY YEAR BUT 1995 AND 2001.
>> Stephen: ARE PAJAMAS THE
ORIGINAL SLEEPER CELL?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DR. PINKER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BOOK IS "THE BETTER ANGELS
OF OUR NATURE" STEVEN PINKER.
