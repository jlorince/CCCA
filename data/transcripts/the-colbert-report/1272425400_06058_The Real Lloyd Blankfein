I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG.
NATION, I'M AS MAD AS ANYONE OUT THERE AT THE WALL STREET BANKS.
THEY HAVE HURT SO MANY PEOPLE.
BUT NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM BY DEMONIZING AN AVERAGE JOE, C.E.O. OF
GOLDMAN SACHS JOE-LLOYD BLANKFEIN.
[LAUGHTER]
TODAY POOR LLOYD WAS TROTTED OUT BEFORE THE SENATE TO BE GRILLED
FOR HOURS, AND LLOYD'S TIME DOES NOT COME CHEAP.
BASED ON LAST YEAR'S SALARY, HE MAKES $5,000 AN HOUR.
$6,000 IF THERE'S KISSING.
[LAUGHTER]
THANK GOODNESS AMIDST ALL THE BLACK FEIN BASHING OUT THERE,
FOX NEWS'S LOVELY MARTHA McCALLUM AND THE EVEN LOVELIER BILL HEMMER HELPED US GET TO
KNOW THE REAL LLOYD BLANKFEIN.
JIM?
>> WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT LLOYD BLANKFEIN?
HERE IS SOME OF THE BACKGROUND.
HE GREW UP IN THE EAST NEW YORK SECTION OF BROOKLYN.
HE RECEIVED A SCHOLARSHIP TO ATTEND HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.
HIS FIRST JOB WE'RE TOLD WAS SELLING PRIME MINISTER MUTTS AT YANKEE STADIUM.
>> 2,600 SONGS ON HIS IPOD.
>> Stephen: 2,600 SONGS?
AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE THOUSANDS OF SONGS HE HAS HIDDEN ON HIS CAIMAN ISLAND IPOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, CAYMAN BUDDIES OUT THERE.
FOLKS, THERE'S EVEN MORE TO KNOW ABOUT HIS IPOD.
>> HE LIKES THE BEATLES AND GLORIA GAYNOR.
>> HE'S AN AMAZING AMERICAN STORY.
>> Stephen: AMAZING.
HE'S JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.
HE LISTENS TO THE BEATLES AND GLORIA GAINER.
THAT MEANS HE CAN LISTEN TO "I WILL SURVIVE" WHILE HIS MARKET
MANIPULATIONS ENSURE THAT THE ENTIRE ECONOMY OF GREECE WILL NOT.
NOW, WHERE, WHERE YOU MIGHT ASK,
DID FOX NEWS GET THESE HARD-HITTING SCOOPS?
WELL, IT'S FROM BULL BEAT, THE MAGAZINE OF WALL STREET HEART-THROBS.
"BULL BEAT" SWOONS OVER BANK C.E.O.S EVEN MORE THAN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."
LLOYD BLANKFEIN POSTER FOR FREE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOLK NEWS LEFT OUT SO MANY GREAT DETAILS FROM LLOYD'S BIO.
FOR INSTANCE, HE LOVES PIZZA CRUST.
HIS DREAM DATE IS TAKING A GIRL TO THE MOON, AND THOSE PEANUTS HE SOLD AT YANKEE STADIUM WERE
ACTUALLY BITS OF STYROFOAM HE PAINTED BROWN, THEN SOLD TO UNSUSPECTING TOURISTS.
THEN HE MADE A KILLING INVESTING IN STOMACH PUMPS.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, IT IS, IT IS||||
