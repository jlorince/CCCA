[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE TO CELEBRATE THIS MILESTONE IN EQUALITY LIVE VIA SATELITE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE
STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE, CHAIRMAN EMERITUS OF THE NAACP AND CIVIL RIGHTS
PIONEER JULIAN BOND.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IS OVER WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING WITH YOUR FREE TIME?
TAKE POTTERY CLASSES, HOT YOGA?
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IS OVER.
IN FACT, IF ANYTHING IT'S INCREASED DURING THE PERIOD WHEN BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN PRESIDENT.
>> Stephen: SORRY, EXCUSE ME, SIR, WHEN THE BLACK PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDENT RACISM GOT WORSE?
THAT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE.
>> YES, DID IT.
>> Stephen: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE HE IS BLACK.
>> EXACTLY SO AND HIS PRESENCE ANGERED PEOPLE WHO ACCUSED ACCUSED ACCUS HIM OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE BLACK.
>> Stephen: HE IS GUILTY OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE BLACK, YOU ADMIT THAT?
>> YES, HE IS.
LUCKILY THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE IT ARE SMALL BUT THE FACT THAT THEY EXIST IS UPSETTING.
>> Stephen: NOW THAT THE SUPREME COURT IT'S PEOPLE IN BLACK ROBES IT'S PEOPLE IN PROGRESS.
>> IT'S STEP -- IT'S NOT A STEP FORWARD BUT YOU KNOW, I AM SURE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
STATEMENTS MADE BY JUSTICE SCALIA.
HE IS THE RUSH LIMBAUGH OF THE SUPREME COURT.
SAYS INAPPROPRIATE THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN MOST RECENTLY ABOUT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
>> Stephen: YES, IT'S NOT A NECESSITY A RACIAL ENTITLEMENT.
>> IT'S NOT AN ENTITLEMENT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION.
IT'S SOMETHING ALL AMERICANS EXPECT TO HAVE.
>> Stephen: CAN WE EVEN REMEMBER WHO WAS DENYING VOTING RIGHTS TO WHOM?
>> OF COURSE WE CAN.
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER.
>> Stephen: I CAN'T.
>> YOU LIVED IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
SOUTH CAROLINA WAS A MAJOR OFFENDER AND SO A CERTAIN DEGREE, MUCH LESS SO NOW, SOUTH
CAROLINA IS AN OFFENDER NOW.
>> Stephen: I DON'T REMEMBER BEING DISCRIMINATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> THE POINT IS THAT YOU WERE NOT DISCRIMINATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR APOLL BY.
>> BLACK PEOPLE IN S.C. WERE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
>> Stephen: WHAT IS WRONG WITH A LITTLE VOTER INTIMIDATION?
DOESN'T IT MAKE THE VOTER HUNGRIER WITH THE RIGHT TO VOTE?
IT'S LIKE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS PLAYING HARD TO GET.
IT'S EXCITING.
IT'S A POLL TEASE.
>> ODDLY ENOUGH THE ATTEMPTS BY REPUBLICANS TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR RACIAL ARE NOTES TO VOTE IN
THE LAST ELECTION SPURRED MORE TO THE POLLS THAN WERE EXPECTED TO GOOD THERE.
>> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT GEORGIA ROOTS, CLARENCE THOMAS HAS GEORGIA ROOTS.
HOW COME YOU SEE IT SO DIFFERENTLY?
>> JUSTICE THOMAS AND I HAVE LIVED DIFFERENT LIVES AND DRAWN DIFFERENT LESSONS FROM THE LIVES
WE'VE LIVED.
HE THINKS THIS WAY AND I THINK THAT WAY AND I'M RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU ARE RIGHT.
OKAY.
ONCE IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE SHOULDN'T YOU LET THE LAW GO?
FOR INSTANCE, WE DON'T HAVE SLAVERY ANYMORE.
SHOULDN'T WE GET RID OF THE 13th AMENDMENT.
DOESN'T SEEM NECESSARY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I'M GLAD IT'S THERE.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
>> BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE AFFECTED ME FIT WEREN'T.
>> Stephen: THAT'S ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO ENSLAVE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AGAIN
AND IT'S A LITTLE PREJUDICIAL.
>> THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE EAGER TO DO SO.
LUCKILY THEIR NUMBERS ARE NOT GREAT AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH POWER.
>> Stephen: WE'RE NOT GOING TO ENSLAVE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SIR, WE HAVE MEXICAN NOWS.
>> INDEED.
I'M GLAD THE MEXICANS ARE GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
>> Stephen: MR. BOND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
