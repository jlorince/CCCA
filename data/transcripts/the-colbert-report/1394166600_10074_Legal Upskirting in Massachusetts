( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE
REPORT, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
I'VE GOT TO SAY, I WAS-- I WAS ALITTLE-- THANK YOU SO MUCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I WAS A LITTLE BIT WORRIED THEREFOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THE TWO
STEPHENS WEREN'T IN SYNC WITHEACH OTHER, BUT THEN WE ACHIEVED
WHAT ASTRONOMERS CALL AHARMONIC CONVERGENCE.
NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW--AND I HOPE YOU DO-- YOU KNOW I
TREAT EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR LIKEIT'S THE 4th OF JULY.
BUT THERE MAY BE NO 4th MOREJULY THAN TODAY, THE 6th OF
MARCH.
BECAUSE TODAY, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, AMERICA GOOT A LITTLE
BIT FREER.
>> A SURPRISING RULING WEDNESDAYFROM THE HIGH COURT IN
MASSACHUSETTS.
THE PRACTICE OF SO-CALLEDUPSKIRTING-- THAT IS, TAKING
PHOTOS UP A WOMAN'S SKIRTWITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE-- IS
ACTUALLY LEGAL IN THAT STATE.
>> Stephen:  UPSKIRTING ISLEGAL!
LET FREEDOM RING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER )
OH, MY.
SOMEONE WAXES THEIR CLAPPER.
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, NATION, FOR THE RECORD, I
WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUTTHIS.
I DO NOT APPROVE OF UNAUTHORIZEDGROIN PHOTOGRAPHY.
IT IS WRONG.
BUT ARE THE ME REMIND YOU, YOUCANNOT SPELL "FREAK" WITHOUT
FIRST SPELLING "FREA."
AND WE OWE OUR NEWFOUND RIGHT TOASSEMBLE UNDER STRANGERS' LEGS
TO PEEPING PATRIOT,MICHAEL ROBERTSON.
NOW, HE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE ACIVIL RIGHTS HERO, LOOKS MORE
LIKE A GUY STROKIN'IT BEHIND THE FROG POND IN
BOSTON COMMON, BUT THAT WOULD BEPREJUDICE.
BECAUSE THIS MAN STRUCK A BLOWFOR LIBERTY.
HE EXPOSED A LEGAL LOOPHOLE INHIS STATE'S OPPRESSIVE PEEPING
TOM LAW, AND LIKE A LOT OFLOOPHOLES, IT WAS EXPOSED ON THE
SUBWAY.
>> BACK IN 2010, THIS GUY,MICHAEL ROBERTSON OF ANDOVER WAS
ACCUSED OF UPSKIRTING TWICE ONTHE GREEN LINE.
HIS DEFENSE?
THE LAW SAY IT'S ONLY A CRIME IFTHE WOMAN IS NAKED.
THAT'S WHAT HIS ATTORNEY ARGUEDLAST YEAR.
>> SECTION 105 DOESN'T PROHIBITTHAT KIND OF CONDUCT.
>> THAT IS COURAGEOUS OF HISLAWYER TO STAND UP FOR FREEDOM.
REALLY COURAGEOUS FOR HER TOSTAND UP ANYWHERE NEAR MICHAEL
ROBERTSON.
THIS DECISION MEANS THATUPSKIRTING AMERICANS NO LONGER
HAVE TO SIT AT THE BACK OF THEBUS.
NOW THEY CAN LAY DOWN ON THEFLOOR LIKE THEY LIKE.
BECAUSE THE MASSACHUSETTSSUPREME COURT FOUND THE THAT
ROBERTSON WAS NOT A PEEPING TOM.
"A FEMALE PASSENGER ON ANM.B.T.A. TROLLEY WHO IS WEARING
A SKIRT, DRESS, OR THE LIKE ISNOT A PERSON WHO IS PARTIALLY
NUDE, NO MATTER WHAT IS OR ISNOT UNDERNEATH THE SKIRT, BY
WAY OF UNDERWEAR OR OTHERCLOTHING."
YES, UNDERWEAR OR NO UNDERWEAR,AS LONG AS YOU WEAR A SKIRT,
TECHNICALLY YOU'RE NOT NUDE.
THAT'S WHY "BASIC INSTINCT" ISRATED "G."
( LAUGHTER )AND FOR ANY LADIES WHO MIGHT BE
UPSET OUT THERE, REMEMBER,MASSACHUSETTS HAS GIVEN YOU THE
RIGHT TO UPSKIRT, TOO.
SO IF YOU'RE NEXT TO A SEXYYOUNG HIGHLANDER, JUST GRAB YOUR
PHONE AND SNAP A PIC OF HISBAGPIPE.
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO THISHERO.
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF ONEDAY SOMEONE BUILT A STATUE TO
HONOR MICHAEL ROBERTSON,ONE ASSUMES RIGHT UNDER THE
STATUE OF LIBERTY.
