>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
REPORT!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN,
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU
WITH US.
NATION, YOU KNOW THERE ARE
MYSTERIOUS FORCES OUT THERE,
FORCES BEYOND OUR PRE
MENTION THAT HAVE A STRANGE
INFLUENCE ON ALL OFS.
I SPEAK OF COURSE OF THE
TERRIFYING PHENOMENON KNOWN
AS OTHER COUNTRIES.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS UNAMERICAN NEWS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: LET'S GET RIGHT
TO THE INTERNATIONAL STORIES
THAT'S DOMINATING THE
HEADLINES.
DECADES OF AUTOCRATIC RULE
APPEAR TO BE COMING TO AN
END FOR KIM JONG IL'S FURY
HAT.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, LONG TIME KOREA
WATCHERS KNOW THAT IT IS AN
UNWRITTEN RULE THAT NOBODY
HE WOULD CAN WEAR SUCH A HAT.
UNWRITTEN BECAUSE NOBODY
THIS HAS ANYTHING TO WRITE
WITH.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH
KOREAN NEWSPAPER, SOUTH
KOREA'S NEWS LEADER, KIM
JONG IL'S SON KIM JONG UN
HAS STARTED WEARING A TOP
QUALITY FURY HAT THAT ONLY
KIM JONG IL HAS BEEN WEARING
SO FAR.
IT MEANS THAT HE HAS NOW
REACHED ALMOST THE SAME
STATUS AS HIS FATHER.
THAT'S RIGHT, AND WE'LL KNOW
HE HAS FULLY TAKEN OVER WHEN
HE IS ALLOWED TO WEAR THE
SAME QUALITY ELEVATOR
REMAYORMAN ONESIE.
NOW CLEARLY FOLKS--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: A FLATTERING
LOOK.
CLEARLY, WHOEVER HAS THE
FANCIEST FUR HAT IS THE
RULER OF NORTH KOREA.
(LAUGHTER)
WITH THAT IN MIND I WOULD
LIKE TO INTRODUCE KIM
JONG-BEAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NORTH KOREA, YOUR DAYS OF
BEING RULED BY THAT TYRANT
IN A BIG FURY HAT ARE OVER.
(LAUGHTER)
AND YOUR DAYS OF BEING RULED
BY A TYRANT IN A BIGGER,
FURRIER HAT HAVE JUST GUN.
MY FIRST DECREASE-- DECREE,
BRING BACK MASH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH HAWKEYE, HOW YOU CAN BE
SO FUNNY IN SURGERY?
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO
DESTABILIZE THE KOREAN
PENINSULA ANY FURTHER.
SO I WILL NOW TAKE OFF MY
HAT AND RELINQUISH CONTROL
OF NORTH KOREA.
OR WILL I?
(LAUGHTER)
OH, OH, YOU NEVER SEE THE
SECOND HAT COMING.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE
