( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOLKS, BEFORE WE GO, I WANT I WANT TO WELCOME TWO NEW MEMBERS OF THE COLBERT NATION, BORN TO
MAX WERNER.
MAX, TREASURE THIS PHOTO BECAUSE IT IS THE LAST MOMENT THEY'LL BE ASLEEP AT THE SAME TIME.
(  LAUGHTER  ) CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WHOLE WERNER FAMILY.
CLOVER AND JULY ARE BEAUTIFUL,
AND MAX, IF YOUR ANGLE ON HAVING TWINS WAS TO SCORE TWICE THE PATERNITY LEAVE.
SORRY, BUDDY, IT ACTUALLY HALVES IT.
BECAUSE ONE CAN WATCH THE OTHER.
I'LL SEE YOU
