SERVING IN IRAQ.
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BESHORT.

PLEASE WELCOME PHIL KLAY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HEY, PHIL.
THANKS FOR COMING ON.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> YOU ARE A MARINE VETERANWHO SERVED IN ANBAR PROVINCE
IN IRAQ FROM JANUARY 2007 TOFEBRUARY 2008.
AND YOU HAVE WRITTEN ACOLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE CALLED"REDEPLOYMENT" AND IT
RECENTLY WON THE NATIONALBOOK AWARD FOR FICTION AND
WAS NAMED BY "THE NEW YORKTIMES" AS ONE OF THE TEN
BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: THE BOOK HAS GOT12 STORIES ABOUT THE IRAQ
WAR.
BUT DO WE REALLY NEED 12STORIES TO TELL THE IRAQ
WAR?
ISN'T IT, YOU KNOW, CHAPTERONE, AMERICA KICKS ASS.
CHAPTER TWO, AMERICA TAKESNAMES.
CHAPTER THREE, MISSIONACCOMPLISHED.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TELLWITH YOUR STORIES?
>> WELL, I THINK YOU NEED ALOT MORE THAN JUST 12
STORIES.
THIS IS MY OFFERING TO THECONVERSATION
ABOUT IRAQ.
I THINK WE DESPERATELY NEEDTO BE HAVING.
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ALOT MORE STORIES ABOUT IRAQ
TO COME.
>> DON'T GET ME WRONG, I AM NOGREATER SUPPORTER OF THE
TROOPS THAN YOURS TRULY.
BUT THE IRAQ WAR IS OVER.
AND IT WAS VERY DIVISIVE,OKAY.
TOWARD THE END THERE, YOUKNOW, SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT
WAS GOOD.
SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WASBAD.
I DIDN'T GO SO I THOUGHT ITWAS GOOD.
I WANTED TO BUT I WAS BUSYHERE USING THE TROOPS AS A
CUDGEL AGAINST PEOPLE WHODISAGREE WITH ME.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
DO WE NEED TO STILL THINKABOUT THE WAR?
I MEAN THE WAR IS OVER.
WHY CAN'T WE MOVE ON, WE'REGOING TO HAVE A NEW WAR IN
IRAQ, SOON.
DON'T WE NEED TO -->> IT'S NOT REALLY OVER,
THAT IS ONE THING.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEANIT'S NOT OVER?
>> IT'S NOT OVER FOR THEIRAQI PEOPLE, CERTAINLY.
WE'RE STILL INVOLVED INIRAQ.
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WHENWE GO TO WAR, THE
OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE, ASA COUNTRY, THEY'RE
LONG-LASTING.
THEY'RE LONG-LASTING INTERMS OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE
OWE THE VETERANS WHO COMEHOME.
SOME OF THEM, YOU KNOW, WHONEED LONG TERM MEDICAL CARE.
AND YOU KNOW, WE ALSO HAVEAN OBLIGATION TO THINK VERY
SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW WE USEMILITARY FORCE WHETHER WE
HAVE DONE SO WISELY AND WHATLESSONS WE CAN DRAW FOR THE
FUTURE TO MAKE US A MORERESPONSIBLE NATION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ARE THERE PEOPLE THAT YOU
SERVED WITH WHO CAN LOOKAT THESE STORIES AND SAY I
KNOW WHAT INFLUENCED YOU?
I KNOW THAT SITUATION?
I WAS THERE IN THAT STORY.
>> WELL, I DID INTERVIEW ALOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, I WENT TO IRAQ ANDDREW ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES.
THERE'S NO ONE PERSON WHOIS JUST A SORT OF THINLY
FICTIONALIZED INDIVIDUAL.
BECAUSE I WOULD FEELCONSTRAINED, SOMEHOW.
I DON'T THINK I COULD BE AS,IN A WEIRD WAY AS TRUTHFUL
AS I WANTED TO BE IN TRYINGTO CHASE DOWN THE
EXPERIENCES I WAS TRYING TOARTICULATE ON THE PAGE.
>> Stephen: YOU COULD BEMORE TRUTHFUL BY MAKING
THINGS UP.
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: REALLY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, THE PERFECTEXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE ILIAD. IF
THERE WAS A TROJAN WARVETERAN HERE AND YOU GAVE
HIM THE ILIAD HE WOULDPROBABLY COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL
THE INACCURACIES.
>> Stephen: THAT'S NOT WHATACHILLES ARMOUR LOOKED LIKE?
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: RHESUS WASN'TWORTH IT.
>> AND YET EVERY GENERATIONSINCE HAS READ THAT BOOK AND
SAID, YOU KNOW, HE'SDESCRIBING WAR.
HE UNDERSTANDS THEEXPERIENCE.
>> Stephen: WELL, AS SOMEBODYWHO, YOU KNOW, WANTS TO
SUPPORT THE TROOPS AND EVENMORE IMPORTANTLY WANTS TO
SEEM LIKE SOMEONE WHOSUPPORTS THE TROOPS,
WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU THINKTHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVED INIRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
AND ANY OF OUR WARS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TOUNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS
EXPERIENCE THAT WE DON'TUNDERSTAND?
>> I MEAN, FIRST OFF, THEREIS NO ONE EXPERIENCE.
IT'S PART OF WHY I WROTE 12STORIES, THEY ARE ALL FROM
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES,DIFFERENT NARRATORS DOING
DIFFERENT JOBS, THERE IS ANINFANTRYMAN A CHAPLAIN,
A MORTUARY AFFAIRS SPECIALIST
FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER, ANDTHE OTHER THING I THINK THAT
IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND,YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST WHAT
YOU EXPERIENCE OVERSEAS,IT'S ALSO WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO COME HOME.
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO COMEHOME AS PART OF, YOU KNOW,
VERY SMALL FRACTION OFAMERICA THAT SERVED.
>> Stephen: LESS THAN ONEPERCENT
>> RIGHT.
TO THE COUNTRY THAT SENT YOUOVER.
AND YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY,THESE WARS ARE OUR
RESPONSIBILITY.
IF, YOU KNOW, IF YOU VOTEDFOR BUSH OR YOU VOTED FOR
OBAMA, IF YOU'RE A TAXPAYER
IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTIONTO THE WARS AT ALL, PROBABLY
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T PAYATTENTION TO THE WARS AT ALL,
THESE ARE YOUR WARS.
AND WE ALL AS CITIZENS HAVEA RESPONSIBILITY TO THINK
ABOUT THEM AND JOIN IN THATCONVERSATION.
>> Stephen: YOU WENT OVER-- YOUWENT OVER IN 2007.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHEN IRAQ WASTHE WORST PLACE ON THE
PLANET.
THE SURGE HADN'T STARTEDYET.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: AND REALLY,THERE WASN'T A SENSE THAT IT
COULD EVER BE TURNED AROUND.
SO YOU LEFT FROM AN AMERICATHAT FELT THAT THIS THING
WAS UNSAVEABLE.
AND YOU CAME BACK A YEARLATER, HAD THE SURGE STARTED
AT THAT POINT?
>> SO I WAS THEREFROM-- THROUGH THE SURGE AND
THROUGH A LOT OF THE
ANBAR AWAKENING, ANBAR HADBEEN THE LOST PROVINCE IN
2006.
AND THEN VIOLENCE RADICALLYDECREASED DURING THAT TIME.
SO A LOT OF US LEFT IRAQFEELING VERY POSITIVELY
ABOUT WHAT WE THOUGHT HADHAPPENED THERE.
AND OF COURSE NOW A LOT OFVETS ARE LOOKING AT IRAQ AND
WHAT IS HAPPENING.
AND TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OFIT.
I TOOK THE SHOW OVER THERE FORJUST ONE WEEK IN 2009.
HEY, IT'S HOT.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHTBE HARD TO CONVEY IN PRINT.
WE LANDED AT 10:30 AT NIGHTAND IT WAS 125 DEGREES.
HOW MUCH TALCUM POWDER DIDYOU GO THROUGH?
BECAUSE AS FAR AS CAN TELLTHE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS COATED
WITH ORANGE TALCUM POWDER.
>> IT'S A VERY SWEATY PLACE.
UH-HUH.
ALSO,.
>> Stephen: BACON LIKE PORKPRODUCTS YOU CAN'T ORDER IT
OVER THERE IN A RESTAURANT,IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
EVEN-- WE WERE ON OUR WAYTHROUGH KUWAIT TO GO THIS
THERE, COULDN'T GET LIKE ABLT.
WHEN I GOT TO CAMP VICTORY,THERE WAS SO MUCH [BLEEP]
BACON-- (APPLAUSE)
IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS LIKE APOLITICAL STATEMENT.
LIKE 24 HOURS A DAY I COULDGO TO MESS AND GET BACON
DID YOU HAVE THE BACONEXPERIENCE?
>> I DIDN'T EAT A LOT OFBACON OVER THERE THERE WERE
A LOT OF POP STARTS-- TARTSBUT MAYBE WE WERE IN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF IRAQ.
>> Stephen: A BACON POPTART, CANYOU
IMAGINE?
WELL PHIL, THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: PHIL KLAY, THEBOOK IS REDEPLOYMENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
