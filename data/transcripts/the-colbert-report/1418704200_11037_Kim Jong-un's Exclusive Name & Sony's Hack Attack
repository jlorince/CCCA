(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK
EVERYBODY THANKS SO MUCH. THANKSEVERYBODY.
NATION, THIS MIGHT NOT COME AS ASURPRISE TO ANYBODY OUT THERE
BUT I, I SO DISLIKENORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN
THAT, LET'S JUST SAY, I'M NOTGOING TO NAME MY NEXT CHILD
AFTER THE GUY.
AND EVIDENTLY NEITHER IS ANYONEELSE.
>> THERE IS ONLY ONE KIM JONG-UNIN NORTH KOREA.
THAT'S A LAW.
BY DIRECTIVE OF THE NORTH KOREANREGIME, THE NAME KIM JONG-UN IS
OFF LIMITS TO ANY OTHER CITIZENSOF THE SECRETIVE AND REPRESSIVE
STATE.
BIRTH CERTIFICATES WITH THENAMES KIM JONG-UN ARE REJECTED
AND ANYONE WHO HAPPENS TO SHARETHE SUPREME LEADER'S NAME MUST
CHANGE IT.
>> Stephen: GOTTA DO IT.
WHEN THE AVERAGE NORTH KOREANSEES THE HEADLINE "KIM JONG-UN
INSPECTS LOCAL LUBE FACTORY,"YOU DON'T WANT THEM WONDERING,
"IS THAT KIM JONG-UN, THE FARMERFROM DOWN THE ROAD, OR KIM
JONG-UN THE DICTATOR WHO KILLEDTHAT FARMER FOR HAVING THE SAME
NAME?"POINT IS, YOU DO NOT WANT TO
CROSS THIS GUY.
CONSIDER WHAT'S HAPPENING TOSONY PICTURES OVER THEIR
UPCOMING MOVIE "THE INTERVIEW,"STARRING JAMES FRANCO AND
TONIGHT'S GUEST SETH ROGEN.
(CHEERING)THEY PLAY, THESE GUYS PLAY TVJOURNALISTS
RECRUITED BY THE C.I.A. TOASSASSINATE KIM JONG-UN, I'M
GUESSING BY SMOKING A LOT OF POTAT HIM.
APPARENTLY, OL' SOURPUSS HEREDOESN'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF
HUMOR WHEN IT COMES TO HIS OWNASSASSINATION.
>> A HUGE HACK ATTACK ROCKING AMAJOR HOLLYWOOD STUDIO.
WHEN THE TRAILER FOR "THEINTERVIEW" CAME OUT, NORTH KOREA
CALLED THE MOVIE AN ACT OF WAR.
NOW SONY PICTURES, THE STUDIOBEHIND THE FILM, HAS BEEN
HACKED.
>> HACKERS HAVE STOLEN FIVE NEWMOVIES AND LEAKED THEM ON TO THE
INTERNET.
>> EXPERTS SAY SONY WILL LIKELYLOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THIS
HOLIDAY SEASON FROM PEOPLEVIEWING ILLEGAL DOWNLOADS OF
THOSE MOVIES ONLINE RATHER THANGOING TO THEATERS.
>> HACKERS WORKING WITHNORTH KOREA COULD BE BEHIND THE
ATTACK.
>> Stephen: YES, SOMEONEHACKED SONY AND ILLEGALLY
DISTRIBUTED MOVIES ON THEINTERNET.
IT HAS TO BE NORTH KOREA.
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WITH THATCAPABILITY IS A 12-YEAR-OLD WITH
BIT TORRENT.
(LAUGHTER)THE HACKERS ALSO LEAKED
UNRELEASED SCRIPTS, INCLUDINGTHE SCRIPT FOR "MALL COP:
BLART 2 "  -- WHAT?!
THAT MOVIE HAS A SCRIPT?!
GREAT.
THEY JUST RUINED THE ENTIREPLOT THEY GAVE AWAY THE ENTIRE
PLOT!LARGE MAN FALLS DOWN!
EH, I'LL STILL SEE IT.
THE HACKERS EVEN LEFT A CALLINGCARD -- "HACKED BY GOP."
WHICH IS ALSO WHAT MITCHMcCONNELL YELLS EVERY TIME HE
SUCCESSFULLY WORKS HISMICROWAVE.
(LAUGHTER)IN THIS CASE, THE G.O.P.
ACTUALLY STANDS FOR GUARDIANS OFPEACE, AND THEY'RE DEMANDING
THAT SONY CANCEL RELEASE OF "THEINTERVIEW."
OR AS THEY POSTED ONLINE, "DOCARRY OUT OUR DEMAND IF YOU WANT
TO ESCAPE US.
AND STOP IMMEDIATELY SHOWING THEMOVIE OF TERRORISM.
YOU, SONY AND F.B.I. CANNOT FINDUS.
WE ARE PERFECT AS MUCH."
YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WHICH IS EITHER A THREAT OR
DIALOGUE FROM THE BLART 2SCRIPT.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, THIS WORRIES ME BECAUSE,
OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS, I'VESAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS THAT
COULD MAKE THIS GUY "UN"-HAPPY.
NATION, I'M NO FAN OF KOREANDICTATOR AND EVIL POTATO KIM
JONG-UN.
THIS PHOTO OF KIM JONG-UN --IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THE
MUSHROOMS END AND HIS HAIRCUTBEGINS.
DEAR LEADER KIM JONG-UN HASFINALLY RE-EMERGED IN PUBLIC
AFTER A COURAGEOUS BATTLE WITHSTAGE 5 CHEESE ANKLE.
(LAUGHTER)I STAND BY ALL THAT.
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THEHACKERS TARGETING INNOCENT
AMERICANS -- NORTH KOREA IS THEGREATEST COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF
THE EARTH.
AND KIM JONG-UN.
OH, HE'S PERFECT AS MUCH.
LET SHINE HIS RADIANT GLOW UPONALL HIS CHILDREN, FROM THE
FROZEN STEPPES OF THE NORTH TOTHE FROZEN MUDFLATS OF THE
SOUTH.
ALL OF AMERICA BOWS BEFORE THEGLORIOUS KIM JONG-UN.
TRULY, HE IS AS WISE AS HE HASCHIN.
WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL INTERVIEWTHE LIE-PEDALING FILMMAKER
BEHIND "THE INTERVIEW" --DECADENT CAPITALIST PIG AND
ENEMY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'SREPUBLIC, SETH ROGEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
