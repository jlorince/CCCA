>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
FOLKS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOLKS, RIGHT NOW THIS VERY
EVENING IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH
CAROLINA, THEY ARE HOLDING
THE INAUGURAL REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
SPONSORED AND BROADCAST ON
FOX NEWS.
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN ITS HISTORY C OPINION
SPAN HAS SOMETHING BETTER TO
FILM.
AND THE CANDIDATES RESPONDED
TO FOX'S CALL.
MITT ROMNEY, SAID I COULDN'T
BE THERE.
SARAH PALIN, OPTED OUT.
NEWT GINGRICH, STOPPED
ANSWERING HIS PHONE.
MIKE HUCKABEE WHO HAS A SHOW
ON FOX NEWS DECLINED FOX
NEWS.
LUCKILY, THE REN CANS HAVE A
DEEP BENCH.
MITCH DANIELS, JOHN HUNTSMAN
AND MICHELLE BACHMAN WHO
ALSO SAID NO.
BUT I CANNOT WAIT TO GET
HOME TO WATCH IT BECAUSE
THIS DEBATE HAS EVERY THING
YOU TUNE IN FOR.
PODIUMS, MICROPHONES, AND
ELEVATED PLATFORMS.
LIGHTS SO YOU CAN SEE IT.
AND A STAND BEHIND THOSE
PODIUMS ACTUAL UPRIGHT
BREATHING BIPEDS LIKE TIM
PAWLENTY, RICK SANTORUM,
HERMAN CAIN, RON PAUL AND
THIS GUY RIGHT THERE WHOSE
NAME ESCAPES ME, EVEN THOUGH
HE'S BEEN ON MY SHOW TWICE
IN THE LAST YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: HELP ME OUT, ME.
>> PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR
GARY JOHNSON.
>> Stephen: I'M SORRY, WHO?
>> GARY JOHNSON.
>> Stephen: NOTHING.
OKAY.
WELL, HE SEEMS NICE.
OF COURSE, I BELIEVE DEBATES
ARE WON BY THOSE WHO SAY THE
MOST.
AND BY THAT STANDARD NONE OF
THESE GUYS CAN COULD BEAT
DONALD TRUMP.
HE SAYS THINGS ALL THE TIME.
LIKE THIS WEEK WHEN ASKED
HIS THOUGHTS ON GAY MARRIAGE,
HE SAID THIS TO THE "NEW
YORK TIMES".
>> IT'S LIKE IN GOLF ARC LOT
OF PEOPLE, I DON'T WANT THIS
TO SOUND TRIVIAL BUT A LOT
OF PEOPLE ARE SWITCHING TO
THESE REALLY LONG PUTTERS.
VERY UNATTRACTIVE.
IT'S WEIRD.
YOU SEE THESE GREAT PLAYERS
WITH THESE REALLY LONG
PUTTERS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
SINK THE THREE FOOTERS ANY
MORE.
AND I HATE IT I'M A
TRADITIONALIST.
I HAVE SO MANY FABULOUS
FRIENDS WHO HAPPEN TO BE GAY
BUT I'M A TRADITIONALIST.
EXACTLY.
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS LIKE
GOLFERS USING THOSE WEIRD
LONG CLUBS.
IT'S UNNATURAL.
GOD CREATED ADAM AND EVE,
NOT ADAM AND BIG BERTHA.
I AM SURE, I'M SURE THAT
DONALD'S WISDOM CAN BE
APPLIED TO A HOST OF OTHER
PRESSING ISSUES.
LIKE WHETHER WE SHOULD RAISE
THE DEBT CEILING.
IT'S BAD, LIKE ALMOND
BUTTER.
THEY'RE MAKING BUTTER OUT OF
EVERY KIND OF NUT THESE DAYS,
CASHEW BUTTER, ALMOND BUTTER,
DEBT CEILING.
>> AND I'M SURE--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: AND I'M SURE
HE'S GOT A PLAN FOR
MEDICARE.
MEDICARE IS LIKE A NICE SET
OF CUFFLINKS, NOBODY WEARS
CUFFLINKS ANY MORE.
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP YOU
WORE A BELT THAT MATCHED
YOUR SHOES, NICE TIE PEN AND
CUFFLINKS T WAS SIMPLE YOU
LOOKED SHARP, BROWN SHOES
BLACK BLELT, BLACK SHOES,
BLACK BELT, MEDICARE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW OF COURSE
THE REAL TEST OF A PRESIDENT
IS HOW HE'LL PERFORM AS
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
WILL HAVE TO ARTICULATE OUR
MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN.
>> SHAVING CREAM IS A GEL
NOW.
>> AFGHANISTAN.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO AMERICA, TAKE
HEART.
DONALD TRUMP COULD BE IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
WHICH IS LIKE THE OLD DAYS
WHEN YOU HAD TO LICK A
STAMP.
NOW THERE'S STICKERS.
