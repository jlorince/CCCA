>> Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
>> STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
STEPHEN!
( CHEERS )
>> Stephen:  FOLKS, YOU ARE AN EMOTIONAL DEFIBRILATOR.
NATION, I KNOW HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW, BUT
BARACK OBAMA JUST DOESN'T SEEM AMERICAN TO ME.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
MITT ROMNEY AGREES WITH ME.
>> HIS WHOLE PHILOSOPHY IS AN UPSIDE DOWN PHILOSOPHY THAT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.
IT'S A VERY STRANGE AND IN SOME RESPECTS FOREIGN TO THE AMERICAN
EXPERIENCE TYPE OF PHILOSOPHY.
>> Stephen:  YEAH, HE JUST-- HE JUST SEEMS FOREIGN.
AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY,
YOU KNOW.
MAYBE IT WAS HIS WEIRD MIDDLE NAME OR HIS FOREIGN DAD OR THE FACT THAT OBAMA HAS A DIFFERENT...
YOU KNOW...
( LAUGHTER ) WAY OF MOVING HIS HAND IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.
BUT NOW, THANKS TO THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN, I THINK I'VE FIGURED IT OUT.
YOU SEE, TODAY, MITT IS EMBARKING ON A WORLDWIDE TOUR OF THREE COUNTRIES.
HE PACKED HIS BAGS, GOT HIS SHOTS, AND STRAPPED HIS DOG TO THE ROOF OF HIS JET.
( APPLAUSE ) NOW, MITT'S FIRST STOP IS LONDON TO SOLVAGE AMERICA'S SPECIAL
CONNECTION WITH THE ENGLISH PEOPLE.
AS A ROMNEY AIDE TOLD LONDON'S "TELEGRAPH," THE WHITE HOUSE
DIDN'T FULLY APPRECIATE THE SHARED HISTORY WE HAVE BECAUSE WE ARE PART OF AN ANGLO-SAXON
HERITAGE, AND ROMNEY FEELS THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP IS SPECIAL.
( LAUGHTER ) WELL SAID.
I WOULD GO FURTHER AND ARGUE THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP IS ALSO A RELATIONSHIP.
( LAUGHTER ) NOW, OF COURSE, FOLKS, OF COURSE, THE MEDIA GOTCHA-RAZZI
ARE SAYING THAT ANGLO-SAXON IS SOME SORT OF RACIAL CODE WORD AS IN WHITE ANGLO-SAXON
PROTESTANTS, OKAY.
BUT MITT'S CAMPAIGN ISN'T SAYING HE'S A WASP.
THEY NEVER SAID WHITE OR PROTESTANT.
THEY'RE JUST SAYING THAT HE'S AN ASS.
A BIG ONE.
THIS IS IMPORTANT, FOLKS.
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS GOES FAR ENOUGH.
I MEAN, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE NOT ONLY OUR COMMON ANGLO-SAXON HERITAGE BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR
SHARED BATTLE OF HASTINGS HERITAGE WHEN OUR SHARED FRENCH NORMAN HERITAGE CONQUERED OUR
SHARED ANGLO-SAXON HER TEG BY SHOOTING AN ARROW THROUGH OUR SHARED KING HAROLD'S EYE.
OBAMA DIDN'T GET THAT.
AND, HEY, I DON'T SEE RACE BUT I SEE SIXTH NORMAN GERMANIC TRIBAL ASSOCIATION.
I DON'T EVEN SEE MY OWN RACE.
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M A CELT AND I BELIEVE THEM.
MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE, FOLKS,
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ANGLO-SAXON EXPERIENCE, ROMNEY NOT ONLY WALKS THE WALK.
HE TALKS THE TALK.
JUST LISTEN TO HIS LATEST STUMP SPEECH.
>> THANK YOU, AND GOD BLESS
