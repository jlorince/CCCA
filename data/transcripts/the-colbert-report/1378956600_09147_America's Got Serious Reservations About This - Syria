LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE'S ANEVEN BIGGER BIRACIAL PROBLEM IN
THIS COUNTRY-- BARACK OBAMA.
LAST NIGHT, OUR SO-CALLEDCOMMANDER IN CHIEF ATTACKED OUR
TUESDAY NIGHT LINEUP TO TALKABOUT SYRIA.
WE HAD TO MISS "AMERICA'S GOTTALENT," JUST TO WATCH
"AMERICA'S GOT SERIOUSRESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS."
( LAUGHTER )TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, OBAMA HIT BELOWTHE BELT, IF YOU WEAR YOUR BELT
RIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEART.
JIM?
>> ASSAD'S GOVERNMENT GASSED TODEATH OVER 1,000 PEOPLE,
INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN.
>> Stephen:  NOW HE'S PLAYINGTHE DEATH CARD.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
NO ONE CAN RESIST THAT, OTHERTHAN JOE LHOTA.
( LAUGHTER )I SAY-- I SAY, FOLKS, I SAY, IF
OBAMA REALLIMENTED TO SELL USSYRIA, HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A
PAGE FROM THE PEOPLE SELLING USSIRI BECAUSE PUSHING THE
IPHONE AND A WAR ARE A LOTALIKE-- YOU JUST SAY THAT THE
NEW ONE IS SMALLER, FASTER, ANDCHEAPER, AND PEOPLE WILL BUY IT,
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE LSHED GOTONE AND THEY'RE STILL PAYING OFF
THE PREVIOUS MODEL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT
THE iPHONE 5S.
DESPITE THE MEDICINE'S SPEECHWAS MOOT ON, ARRIVAL THANKS TO
JOHN KERRY.
>> IS THERE ASKING AT THIS POINTHIS GOVERNMENT COULD DO OR OFFER
THAT WOULD STOP AN ATTACK?
>> SURE, HE COULD TURN OVEREVERY SINGLE BIT OF HIS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS TO THE INTERNATIONALCOMMUNITY IN THE NEXT WEEK, BUT
HE ISN'T ABOUT TO DO IT AND ITCAN'T BE DONE, OBVIOUSLY.
>> Stephen:  BUT REMEMBER THEOLD SAYING-- YOU CAN'T SELL
"CAN'T" WITHOUT "CAN."
>> RUSSIA SAY REAL GAME PLAN INWHAT SOME CONSIDERED A GAFFE,
ENCOURAGING SYRIA TO TAKE ACTIONSAYING WE'RE CALLING ON THE
SYRIAN AUTHORITIES TO NOT ONLYPUT WEAPONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL
CONTROL BUT ALSO FOR ITS FURTHERDESTRUCTION.
>> THIS MORNING SYRIA SAID ITACCEPTED THE RUSSIAN PROPOSAL TO
PLACE CHEMICAL WEAPONS UNDERINTERNATIONAL CONTROL.
>> Stephen:  OH, MY GOSH, THATIS SO EMBARRASSING.
THE RUSSIANS OUTMANEUVERED THEOBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE PLAYINGCHECKERS, AND PUTIN IS PLAYING
SHIRTLESS CHESS.
( LAUGHTER )ON HORSE.
UN THAT'S NOT EASY.
WELL, FOLKS, THERE IT IS.
CRISIS AVERTED.
NOW, CONGRESS SUSPENDS ITS VETEON A MILITARY STRIKE, THE U.N.
SECURES ASSAD'S CHEMICALSSTOCKPILES, AND THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE CAN GO BACK TO BOOINGKILLED WITH CONVENTIONAL
WEAPONS. EVERYBODY WINS.
