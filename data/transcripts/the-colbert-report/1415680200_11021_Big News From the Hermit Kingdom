(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")THAT'S THE SOUND OF FREEDOM,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
PLEASE, SIT DOWN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WHAT DID AN AMAZING NIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THE FORCEIS STRONG WITH THESE ONES
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FOLKS, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
LET'S DO THE SHOW, WE'VE GOT
LOT TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING TO BEANALYZING THE ONGOING
GEOPOLITICAL REALIGNMENT IN THEMIDDLE EAST
WITH ANDY COHEN MAYBE OVERSOME COCKTAILS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FIRST, NATION, HUGE NEWS OUT
OF NORTH KOREA WHERE DEAR LEADERKIM JONG-UN HAS FINALLY
RE-EMERGED IN PUBLIC AFTER ACOURAGEOUS BATTLE WITH STAGE 5
CHEESE ANKLE. SO GOOD TO SEE HIMBACK.
UNFORTUNATELY, HIS BEST FRIENDLUBEY WASN'T AVAILABLE TO
CELEBRATE WITH HIM, SO INSTEADKIM PAID A VISIT TO THE SECOND
HAPPIEST PLACE IN NORTH KOREA.
AN ORPHANAGE.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, THE BEDS ARE ALL
EMPTY BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE ATWORK.
WHICH IS TOO BAD.
KIM WAS LOOKING FORWARD TOTEACHING THEM HOW TO SMOKE.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, HE'LL EVENTUALLY HAVE
TO PASS THE CIGARETTE OFF TO THESTUFFED ANIMALS BONING ON THE
DRESSER IN THE BACKGROUND
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERING)
BUT FOLKS, AS MUCH AS THIS PHOTODELIGHTS, THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER
STORY COMING OUT OF THE HERMITKINGDOM.
>> TWO AMERICAN PRISONERS,KENNETH BAE AND MATTHEW TODD
MILLER, RETURNED TO U.S. SOILFROM NORTH KOREA.
>> WE HAD AN INDICATION THATTHERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF
RELEASE, AND WE PURSUED IT.
IT'S A GOOD-NEWS STORY.
>> Stephen: IS IT A GOOD NEWSSTORY, SIR?
'CUZ FOX NEWS IS REPORTING,"OBAMA CANCELS TWO AMERICANS'
VACATIONS."
YEAH, SHOCKING.
OF COURSE, THE MOST MIRACULOUSPART OF THEIR RELEASE IS THAT IT
WAS NOT NEGOTIATED BY DENNISRODMAN.
(LAUGHTER)>> THIS RELEASE WAS SECURED BY
AMERICA'S TOP SPY, JAMESCLAPPER, THE DIRECTOR OF
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE WHOCARRIED A PERSONAL LETTER FROM
PRESIDENT OBAMA TO NORTH KOREANLEADERS.
>> Stephen: YEP, WE GAVE THEMA DOSE OF THE CLAPPER!
(LAUGHTER)AND ALL IT TOOK WAS A PERSONAL
LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THAT WAS A NICE PERSONAL TOUCH.
THESE DAYS, TOO MANY KIDS JUSTTEXT THEIR PARDON REQUESTS.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO SAY, I DON'T
ENVY THESE MEN.
TWO YEARS OF FORCED LABOR.
THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD.
>> I LEARNED A LOT.
I GREW A LOT.
LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT IN A GOODWAY.
>> OR MAYBE IT WAS GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- YOUCAN NEVER BE TOO RICH OR TOO
IMPRISONED IN NORTH KOREA.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, WE'VE ALL TRIED THE ZONE
DIET.
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR THEDEMILITARIZED ZONE DIET.
PLUS, THERE'S NO CHANCE YOU WILLGIVE UP EARLY, BECAUSE IT'S
ALMOST AS HARD TO GET OUT OFNORTH KOREA AS IT IS A GYM
MEMBERSHIP.
(LAUGHTER)ANYWAY, WELCOME HOME, GENTLEMEN.
