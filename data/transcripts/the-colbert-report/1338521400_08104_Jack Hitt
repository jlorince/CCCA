(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK CALLED A BUNCH OF AMATEURS.
A SEARCH FOR THE AMERICAN CHARACTER.
THE SEARCH IS OVER.
I'M RIGHT HERE.
PLEASE WELCOME JACK HITT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JACK, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
YOU SILVER HAIRED DEVIL.
NOW JACK, YOU AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR QUITE A FEW YEAR, BOTH FROM CHARLES
TOVN, SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, TWO SOUTH CAROLINAS IN THE SAME ROOM.
>> CHARLESTONIANS.
>> DOMINION OR SOMETHING,
TWO.
>> I MEAN TWO.
>> A QUORUM.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NOW JACK BESIDES BEING A ESTEEMED CHARLESTON YAN,
ALSO A CONTRIBUTING WRITING FOR HAPPENER, GARDEN AND GUN MAGAZINE, OBVIOUSLY, YOU ARE
ALSO THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK, A BUNCH OF AMATEURS, A SEARCH FOR THE AMERICAN CHARACTER.
OKAY.
WHY, I GOT MY OWN THEORY.
BUT WHY ARE AM MUIRS IF YOUR OPINION THE AMERICAN CHARACTER.
>> WELL, FROM THE BEGINNING,
EVERYBODY IN EUROPE THOUGHT WE WERE A BUNCH OF AMATEUR YAHOO!s, FOOLS, UNLETTERED PEOPLE, SELF-MADE
FRONTIERSMAN, DAVEY CROCKETT TYPES.
AND ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL I BELIEVE THE EUROPEANS VIEW OF US REALLY HASN'T CHANGED
IN THOSE 200 CHANGES.
>> Stephen: REALLY, WELL WE KICKED THEIR AS IN CONCORD,
DID WE NOT.
>> WE DID.
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP THEM FROM LOOKING DOWN THEIR NOSE AT US.
EUROPEANS THOUGHT IT WAS A FACT THAT AMERICAN MEN WERE SMALLER, WEAKER.
SMALL NEVER EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.
AND ALL OF THE OUR WOMEN WERE WERE MORE INFERTILE AND AND-- OUR ANIMALS WERE EVEN STUPID.
THEY THOUGHT THE VAPORS OF NORTH AMERICA MADE US STUPID,
IGNORANT AND MEAN.
>> Stephen: I DIDN'T THINK COY HATE EUROPEANS MORE.
(LAUGHTER) BUT HOW DID OUR-- SO THEN DID WE EMBRACE --
>> SO WE-- .
>> Stephen: FRANKLIN WENT OVER THERE AND PLAYED THE ROLE OF LIKE THE BUMPKIN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, HE PUT ON THE COON SKIN CAP AND MET THE KING AS THIS KIND OF,
YOU KNOW, THIS AMERICAN FRONTIERSMAN, HE IS PROBABLY THE ONLY SOPHISTICAT WE HAD
AT THE TIME, RIGHT.
AND YET HE SHOWS UP THERE LOOKING LIKE DAVEY CROCKETT.
AND THERE IS A GREAT MOMENT WHEN JOHN ADAMS COMES TO SORT OF CHECK ON HIM BECAUSE
OF COURSE FRANKLIN IS A FAMOUS WOMANIZER AND BOOZER.
>> Stephen: HE IS, YEAH.
>> RIGHT, I MEAN THAT WAS HIS REPUTATION.
EVEN THEN.
AND ADAMS GETS OUT 69 CARRIAGE AND HIS LACE AND WIG AND POWDER AND EVERYTHING.
AND I LIKE TO THINK OF FRANKLIN STEPPING OUT WITH THE COON SKIN CAP AND-- .
>> Stephen: AN NOTHING ELSE ON.
>> HE DIDN'T PROMOTE AIR BATHS, THAT WAS EXACTLY WHATS THAT WHAT.
>> Stephen: DID HE REALLY.
>> YEAH, NUDITY WAS A BIG DEAL FOR HIM.
>> Stephen: IS THAT HOW HE --
>> HE WAS AMERICAN'S FIRST NUDIST.
>> Stephen: IS THAT HOW HE THOUGHT AMERICANS WERE SMALLER IN EVERY WAY.
I TELL BHAU I LIKE ABOUT AMATEURS, OKAY.
IS THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ELITE, OKAY.
I DON'T TRUST THE ELITE.
OKAY, I'M JUST AN AVERAGE JOE, YOU'RE JUST AN AVERAGE JOE, OKAY.
AND THE ELITE FROWN ON GUYS LIKE US WITHOUT GO STRAIGHT FROM THE GUTTER.
AMERICANS FLY BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS.
THAT'S WHY THE SEATS OF OUR PANTS ARE SO HUGE.
(LAUGHTER) DO YOU AGREE?
IS THAT REALLY WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE JUST KIJD OF
MAKING IT UP AS WE GO ALONG.
>> NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THAT WE FEEL IT IS ALMOST OUR PRIVILEGE THAT WE CAN JUST
START OVER AT ANY TIME IN OUR LIFE.
FITZGERALD SAYS THAT THERE ARE NO SECOND ACTS IN AMERICA.
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS NOTHING BUT SECOND ACTS.
WE FEEL IT IS OUR OUR RIGHT TO STORM OFF TO THE GARAGE AND DECIDE HUH, I'M GOING
INVEST THE NEW CAR, THE NEW ENERGY SOURCE, THE NEW FACEBOOK PAGE, WHATEVER IT IS.
AND WE DO THIS WITH A KIND OF CYCLICAL REGULARITY.
SO THAT IS MY CASE IN THE BOOK, IS THAT WE ALWAYS THINK THAT THE AGE OF AMATEURISM IS PASSED T WAS
SOME EARLIER TIME, OUR GRANDFATHERS BUT ACTUALLY IT IS A TIME THAT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK AROUND.
I THINK IS COMING BACK NOW.
>> Stephen: SINCE 50% OF ALL COLLEGE GRADUATES CAN'T GET A JOB IN THE FIELD THEY
STUDIED FOR, AREN'T WE GOING TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF NEW AMATEURS COMING ALONG.
BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME, RIGHT.
>> RIGHT.
AND THAT IS, IN FACT,
HAPPENING.
I MEAN THERE IS A HUGE MOVEMENT, YOU KNOW, MAKE MAGAZINE, THE MAKER FAIRS,
DIY MOVEMENT, AMATEURISM IS BUSTING OUT ALL OVER.
THESE DIY WORKSHOPS ARE POPPING UP IN EVERY TOWN.
SO AMERICA IS IN THE GRIP OF ONE OF ITS MORE CREATIVE PERIODS AT THE BOTTOM,
RIGHT, AT THE AMATEUR LEVEL.
I WAS GOING TO SAY, YOUR FRIENDS ON WALL STREET ARE,
WHO CLAIM THIS NEW TITLE JOB CREATORS?
YOU KNOW, HI NEVER HEARD THAT PHRASE BEFORE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: YOU SHOULD GO TO THE CLUBS I GO TO.
WHAT UP MY JOB CREATOR THAT IS HOW WE CALL IT.
THAT IS WHAT WE CALL EACH OTHER.
WE CAN CALL EACH OTHER THAT.
>> BUT THESE ARE-- THESE ARE BANKERS.
THIS IS-- .
>> Stephen: THE BANKERS THEY CREATE JOBS IN BANKS.
>> NO THEY SPUN JOBS.
THE JOB CREATORS ARE THE AMATEURS AT THE THAT HAVE THE GUTS TO WALK OUT OF A
GARAGE AND DECIDE I WILL TAKE THIS IDEA AND TAKE IT TO THE STREET AND OPEN A SHOP, YOU KNOW.
>> Stephen: NOW YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL WRITER.
HOW GOOD COULD THIS BOOK BE?
(LAUGHTER) JACK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
JACK HITT, A BUNCH OF AMATEURS, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
