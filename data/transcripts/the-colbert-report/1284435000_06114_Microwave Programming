FOLKS, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.
NATION, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN
OF TELEVISION'S INFLUENCE ON
AMERICAN CULTURE.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT BEFORE
THERE WAS TV SITTING ON A COUCH
FOR HOURS ON END SEEMED KIND OF
SAD.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED BY A
RECENT PEW RESEARCH POLL SHOWING
THAT THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO
THINK A TV SET IS A NECESSITY
HAS DROPPED FROM 64% FOUR YEARS
AGO TO ONLY 42% TODAY.
AND ACCORDING TO THE SAME POLL,
MORE PEOPLE PRIZE THEIR MIKE
WAVE OVEN THEIR THAN TELEVISION.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT
I AM A SUCKER FOR MICROWAVE
PROGRAMING, SPECIFICALLY THE
LONG-RUNNING DRAMA "HUNGRY MAN
SALISBURY STEAK."
IT IS SO SUSPENSEFUL.
WHAT PARTS ARE GOING TO END UP
COLD?
WHAT PARTS ARE GOING TO END UP
WAY TOO HOT?
AND WHEN, WHEN WILL THOSE MASHED
POTATOES AND GREENED BEANS STOP
SQUABBLING AND JUST DO IT
ALREADY?
BUT, OF COURSE, IN SOME WAYS
THIS NEWS IS NOT THAT SURPRISING
BECAUSE NOWADAYS YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY NEED A TV TO WATCH
TELEVISION.
YOU CAN WATCH MY SHOW ON THE
INTERNET, ON AN iPAD, AND IF
YOU'RE SCRITS FRIENDIC, YOU
ALREADY KNOW WE BEAM IT DIRECTLY
INTO YOUR TEETH.
[LAUGHTER]
AND, HEY, I SAY IF AMERICANS ARE
MORE INTERESTED IN MICROWAVES
THAN TVS, I NEED TO MAKE MY SHOW
MORE MICROWAVY.
JIMMY, LET'S PUT UP THE NEW SET.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE GOT SOME
PRESETS ON THE SIDE THERE.
THERE'S BLIND RAGE, THREAT DOWN
AND, OF COURSE, PIZZA.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
JIMMY, NUKE ME.
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME.
NATION, NO MATTER HOW WE TRY TO
HEAT IT UP, THE ECONOMY JUST
WON'T DEFRAWS.
AND I AM REALLY STEAMED THAT AT
THIS POINT -- WAIT, WAIT, WHAT'S
HAPPEN ?NG WAIT A SECOND?
I MUST HAVE METAL ON ME.
WAIT, WAIT, HERE'S MY CHANGE.
WAIT, WAIT.
I'LL GET RID OF MY KEYS.
WHERE ARE MY KEYS.
GET RID OF THOSE.
LIFE IS STILL HAPPENING.
OH, WAIT, I KNOW, I KNOW, THE
ALUMINUM FOIL I KEEP INSIDE MY
JACKET.
THERE YOU GO.
TURN IT OFF.
TURN IT OFF.
TURN IT OFF, JIMMY.
TURN IT OFF.
HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT.
IT KEEPS MY JUICES IN.
WOW.
I GOT... I CAN DRY OUT OVER THE
COURSE OF THE SHOW IS WHAT I'M
SAYING.
WOW, THIS IS HARDER THAN IT
LOOKS.
MY HAT'S OFF TO THE LEAN CUISINE
PEOPLE.
NO
