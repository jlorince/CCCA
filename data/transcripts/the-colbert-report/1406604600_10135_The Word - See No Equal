(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, THESE DAYS-- THESE
DAYS IT HAS BECOMEFASHIONABLE FOR POLITICIANS
TO ATTACK THE RICH.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAYSTICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK
MY BONES BUT MY SECURITYTEAM WILL SHOOT YOU.
SORRY SOCIALISTS, YOU'RENOT GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL
GUILTY.
BEING RICH IS FANTASTIC ITIS WONDERFUL IT IS
GARGLEGADONG, WHICH IS A WORDDESCRIBING THE PLEASURE OF
WEALTH WHICH CANNOT BETRANSLATED INTO POOR TALK.
THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMESWHEN I'M RICHIN' AROUND TOWN I
WILL ACCIDENTALLY CATCH AGLIMPSE OF A NONRICH PERSON.
THEN I GET A FUNNY FEELINGIN MY HEART, APPARENTLY I
HAVE AN ALLERGY TONONWEALTHY PEOPLE CALLED
EMPATHY.
(LAUGHTER)MY DOCTOR SAID THERE MAY
NEVER BE A CURE BECAUSE IT'SNOT A DISEASE.
PLEASE, GIVE GENEROUSLY.
FORTUNATELY THE FREE MARKETHAS FOUND THE WAY TO MAKE
THE 1% FEEL 99% BETTER ANDIT BRINGS ME TO TONIGHT'S
WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SEE NO EQUAL.
ALL TOO OFTEN WESUPERWEALTHY FIND OURSELVES
COMING IN CONTACT WITH THEMONEY DISABLED.
BUT SOON, SOON WE COULD ALLBE SAVED THAT UNPLEASANTNESS
THANKS TO THE EXAMPLE SET BYA NEW APARTMENT COMPLEX HERE
IN NEW YORK CITY.
>> THE CONTROVERSIAL RULINGIN NEW YORK CITY.
A DEVELOPER PLAN TO INCLUDEA POOR DOOR IN A LUXURY
APARTMENT COMPLEX.
>> THE BUILDING WILL HAVE219 UNITS OVERLOOKING THE
WATERFRONT AND 55 AFFORDABLEUNITS THAT FACE THE STREET.
THE IDEA, SPARKING BACKLASHBECAUSE IT REQUIRES
AFFORDABLE LIVING TENANTS TOENTER THE BUILDING USING A
SEPARATE DOOR THROUGH A BACKALLEY.
>> Stephen: YES.
A POOR DOOR BECAUSE IF IDON'T SEE SOMETHING, I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT, ITDOESN'T EXIST.
AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, IT'S JUST LIKE-- IT'S
JUST LIKE THE OLD SAYING,OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF SIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)AND I BELIEVE THAT SEPARATE
DOORS ARE GREAT.
AS ANOTHER LUXURY HOMEBUILDER DAVID VON SPRECKELSON
RECENTLY VON SPRECKELED,I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO
EXPECT VERY HIGH INCOMEHOMEOWNERS WHO PAID A
FORTUNE TO LIVE IN THEIRBUILDING TO HAVE TO BE IN
THE SAME BOAT AS LOW INCOMERENTERS WHO ARE VERY
FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A NEWBUILDING IN A GREAT
NEIGHBORHOOD.
YES.
THEY GET TO LIVE IN A NEWBUILDING IN A GREAT
NEIGHBORHOOD.
WHAT ELSE DO THEY WANT.
DIGNITY?
NOW WHO'S GREEDY?
AND FOLKS, IF YOU THINKABOUT IT, THERE'S A SOUND
MORAL PRINCIPLE BEHINDSEPARATE WEALTH BASED
ENTRANCES.
JESUS HIMSELF SAID IT ISEASIER FOR A CAMEL TO  GO
THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLETHEN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.
THAT'S WHY THE RICH NEED ASEPARATE ENTRANCE TO HEAVEN.
THAT NEEDLE ONE SMELLS ALLCAMELLY.
IF ANYTHING, FOLKS-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I BELIEVE JUST ONE POOR DOORIS NOT ENOUGH.
BECAUSE IF I'M PAYING OVER$25 MILLION FOR A PENTHOUSE
APARTMENT, WHY SHOULD I HAVETO BE STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR
WITH WHATEVER VAGRANT ISDWELLING IN THE 15 MILLION
DOLLAR HOVEL ONE FLOORBENEATH ME.
UNDER 20 MILLION DOLLARS, WHATIS THIS, BANGLEDESH?
NO, POOR DOORS-- POOR DOORSARE JUST THE LATEST IN A
TREND THAT HELPS US HAVE'SNOT HAVE TO SEE THE HAVE
NOTS.
WE HAVES GET SKYBOXES INSTEAD OFBLEACHERS, PERSONAL SHOPPERS
INSTEAD OF GOING TO A STOREAND AN AIRPORT'S FIRST CLASS
HAS ITS OWN TSA LANE.
I MEAN EVEN THE HAPPIESTPLACE ON EARTH IS HAPPIER
FOR US BECAUSE WE CAN PAY UPTO AN EXTRA $500 AN HOUR TO
SKIP TO THE FRONT OF LINESAT DISNEY WORLD.
EVEN BETTER, WE GET TO MEETSNOW WHITE'S TOP SECRET 8th
DWARF.
(LAUGHTER)BUT AS EXCLUSIVE AS ALL
THESE PERKS ARE, I THINKOCCASIONALLY I STILL RUN
INTO AVERAGE PEOPLE LIKE MYCHAUFFEUR OR MY CHEF.
AND I JUST GOT TO SAY, WHATIS THE POINT OF BEING RICH
IF YOU CAN'T BE LEFT ALONEWITH YOUR MONEY?
THAT'S ALL WE ASK.
(LAUGHTER)THERE MUST BE A SIMPLE WAY
TO GET AWAY FROM AVERAGEPEOPLE.
I DON'T NEED A PENTHOUSE.
I WOULD SETTLE FOR SOMETHINGSMALL AND LUXURIOUS.
MAYBE A TINY SILK LINEDAPARTMENT WITH A PILLOW TO
LAY MY HEAD ON.
JUST ROOM FOR ONE.
CARVED ON A SINGLE PIECE OFMAHOGONY WITH BRASS HANDLES
FOR SIX OF MY SERVANTSTO CARRY ME TO MY COUNTRY
PLACE.
IT'S NOT A BIG PIECE OF LANDBUT AT LEAST IT'S IN A GATED
COMMUNITY.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
