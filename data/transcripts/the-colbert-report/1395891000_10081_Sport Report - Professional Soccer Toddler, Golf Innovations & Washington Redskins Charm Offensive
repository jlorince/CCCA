( LAUGHTER )NOW, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE
NEWS, YOU KNOW WE'RE REACHINGTHE END OF MARCH MADNESS.
IT COMES IN LIKE A LION, ANDGOES OUT LIKE A LION LOSING 10
GRAND BETTING ON WICHITA STATE.
THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WOOOO!
WOOO!
FOLKS, WE ARE IN A DARK CHAPTEROF AMERICAN HISTORY.
SWEDEN IS BEATING USEDUCATIONALLY.
CHINA IS BEATING USECONOMICALLY.
AND ALBANIA IS BEATING USALPHABETICALLY.
( LAUGHTER )I'LL SAY IT AGAIN-- WE MUST
CHANGE OUR NAME TOONE-UNDERSTORE-AAAAMERICA.
AND NOW I CAN'T  BELIEVE I'MSAYING THIS-- WE'RE BEING BEATEN
RECRUITING YOUNG ATHLETES.
WE'RE THE ONES WHO DRAFTEDLEBRON AT 18 WHEN HE ONLY LOOKED
38, BUT THESE DAYS, 18 ISANCIENT, ESPECIALLY IN SOCCER,
OR AS THE EUROPEANS CALL IT,FOOT SOCCER, BECAUSE THE WAFFLE
EATING MAYO DIPPERS INBELGIUM HAVE SIGNED A
20-MONTH-OLD TODDLER TO APROFESSIONAL SOCCER CONTRACT.
THIS BOY, WHOSE NAME IS BRYCEBRITES, WAS SIGNED BY A BELGIAN
TEAM WHOSE SPOKESMAN SAID HISBALL CONTROL IS INCREDIBLE FOR
SOMEONE HIS AGE.
YES, HIS BALL CONTROL ISINCREDIBLE UNLESS IS IT ROLLS
BEHIND THE COUCH BECAUSE HE'SNOT OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE OBJECT
PERMANENCE YET.
BUT BRYCE HAS GOT THEFUNDAMENTALS.
JIMMY, LET'S GO TO THE TAPE.
>> AND HERE COMES BRYCE,CARRYING IT HALF A METER,
DRIBBLING WITH BOTH FEET,STRAIGHT TO THE WALL, AND HE'S
RIGHT BACK ON THE PITCH, LEAVINGTHE COACH IN THE DUST.
AND HE SPOTTED SOMETHING SHINY.
>> Stephen:  JUST IMAGINE THEHEADERS HE'LL BE ABLE TO DO ONCE
HIS FONTANEL CLOSES.
CLEARLY, AMERICA NEEDS TO UP OURRECRUITING GAME.
I SAY IF WE WANT ANY SHOTS ATWINNING THE 2032 WORLD CUP, WE
NEED SCOUTS COVERING LAMAZECLASSES AND SIGNING THE BIGGEST
KICKERS.
AND THAT GOES FOR ALL SPORTS.
WE SHOULD START SCOUTING SPERM,BECAUSE THE FASTEST SWIMMER
COULD BE THE NEXT MICHAELPHELPS.
NEXT UP, FOLKS.
( APPLAUSE )NATION, IT'S NO SECRET, I LOVE
PLAYING WITH MY DIMPLED WHITEBALLS.
AND GOLF'S MOST EXCITING ANNUALEVENT IS THE PROFESSIONAL
GOLFERS ASSOCIATION MERCHANDISESHOW.
IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICANCONVENTION, EXCEPT-- WELL, I
ACTUALLY CAN'T THINK OF ADIFFERENCE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
BUT THIS YEAR'S KEYNOTE SPEAKERSRELAYED SOME SOBERING FACTS
ABOUT THE GAME I NEVER PLAYEDSOBER.
JIM.
>> FOR THE PAST DECADE, 10--MORE THAN 10 YEARS-- OUR GREAT
GAME HAS BEEN IN A STATE OFDECLINE BECAUSE OUR GAME LACKS
INNOVATION.
>> WE'VE LOST FIVE MILLIONGOLFERS OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS,
FIVE MILLION.
THE RESEARCH SAYS THE ANSWERIS VERY SIMPLE-- THEY'RE JUST
NOT HAVING FUN.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen:  YES, AFTER 500YEARS OF WALKING SLOWLY THROUGH
FIELDS, HITTING BALLS IN THEWRONG DIRECTION, THEN SEARCHING
FOR THEM IN ALGAE-FILLED PONDS,SOMETIMES GOLF ISN'T FUN.
FORTUNATELY, THERE'S A WAY TOGET MILLENNIALS BACK ON THE
LINKS, THANKS TO A NEW WEBSITECALLED HACKGOLF, AN OPEN
INNOVATION INITIATIVE AIMED ATCROWDSOURCING THE FUTURE OF THE
GAME.
hashtagyes.com.
WE NEED TO OPEN, INNOVATE, ANDCROWDSOURCE A GOLF 2.00THAT
APPEALS TO THE TWEENS,SPECIFICALLY TWEEN 55 AND
RETIREMENT.
AND THE HACKGOLF MESSAGE BOARDIS ALREADY ABUZZ WITH
OUTSIDE-THE-BOX THE IDEAS THECROWDSOURCERS HAVE HACKED UP,
INCLUDING SURROUND EACH HOLEWITH NETS SIMILAR TO THE
BARRIERS USED IN BOWLING.
ONLY COUNT THE GOOD SHOTS.
AND FREE BEER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WELL, FOLKS, IIGOTTA SAY, I-- ITOOK A MOMENT TO TRY A FAIR
AMOUNT OF THAT LAST DISCUSSION,AND WHILE DOING SO, I CAME UP
WITH MY OWN PARADIGM-SMASHINGGOLF HACK. INSTEAD OF EVERY MAN
FOR HIMSELF, WE DIVIDE GOLFERS INTO
TWO TEAMS AND INSTEAD OF THEMALL HEADING FOR THE SAME GREEN
THEY START ON OPPOSITE SIDES ANDAIM FOR EACH OTHER'S GREENS.
FOR SAFETY, OBVIOUSLY, YOU GOTTALOSE THE CLUBS, AND PUT THE HOLE
10 FEET IN THE AIR AND MAKE THEBALLS BIG AND ORANGE.
NOW, THAT IS A GOLF GAME THATYOUNG PEOPLE MIGHT PLAY.
NEXT UP, FOLKS, FOOTBALL.
THE P.C. POLICE CONTINUE TOHAMMER THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS
OVER THEIR SO-CALLED OFFENSIVENAME, THOUGH, IF YOU'VE SEEN
THEM PLAY RECENTLY THEIR NAME ISTHE LEAST OFFENSIVE THING ON THE
FIELD.
THANKFULLY, REDSKINS OWNERDANIEL SNYDER HAS FOUND A WAY TO
SMOKE'UM THE PEACE PIPE.
>> THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS ARETRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR IMAGE
WITH THE NATIVE AMERICANCOMMUNITY.
OWNER DANIEL SNYDER IS NOWCREATING A FOUNDATION TO ASSIST
AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBES.
>> SNYDER SENT A LETTER TOREDSKINS FANS LAYING OUT A PLAN
TO START THE WASHINGTON REDSKINSORIGINAL  AMERICANS FOUNDATION.
>> Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, THEWASHINGTON REDSKINS' ORIGINAL
AMERICANS FOUNDATION, BECAUSEREDSKINS IS NOT OFFENSIVE IF YOU
ONLY USE IT ONCE IN YOUR NAME.
( LAUGHTER )AND, FOLKS, THE HEALING HAS
ALREADY BEGUN.
THE CHARITY HAS DISTRIBUTED OVER3,000 COLD WEATHER COATS TO
SEVERAL TRIBES, AND YOU CAN SEEHOW HAPPY THEY ARE IN THEIR NEW
GEAR.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
THE FOUNDATION ALSO ASSISTED INTHE PURCHASE OF A NEW BACKHOE
FOR THE OMAHA TRIBE.
THAT'S RIGHT, ASSISTED-- BECAUSEYOU CAN'T EXPECT A TEAM WORTH
1.7 BILLION TO PAY FORTHE ENTIRE BACKHOE.
THOSE THINGS COST THOUSANDS.
TO COVER THAT PRICE THEY'D HAVETO SELL A BEER AND A SOFT
PRETZEL.
THIS MOVE BY DANIEL SNYDERINSPIRES ME BECAUSE MY SHOW HAS
FREQUENTLY COME UNDER ATTACK FORHAVING A SO-CALLED OFFENSIVE
MASCOT.
MY BELOVED CHARACTER CHING-CHONGDING-DONG.
OH, I LOVE TEA.
IT'S SO GOOD FOR YOU.
GIRL.
YOU COME HERE.
I NEED NO SUGAR WHEN YOU AROUND.
COME ON MY RICKSHAW, I GIVE YOUA RIDE TO BANGKOK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NOW, FOLKS THE SMALL MINDED OUTTHERE CAN CALLED CHING-CHONG
DING DONG AN OFFENSIVECARICATURE OF
AN ASIAN AMERICAN.
THAT IS WRONG. HE IS NOT ANAMERICAN. HE IS A CHINAMAN. AND
IF HE EVER HEARD SOMEONE CALLHIM A STEREOTYPE HE WOULD CHOKE
ON HIS OPIUM PIPE.
OF COURSE, THERE IS NO PLEASINGTHE ATTACK DOGS OVER ASIAN MEDIA
WATCH WHO DEMANDED THAT I REMOVECHING-CHONG FROM THE SHOW'S
LETTERHEAD AND STOP HAVING HIMACCEPT AWARDS ON MY BEHALF.
THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS,OFFENSIVE OR NOT-- NOT--
CHING-CHONG IS PART OF THE OF OFTHE UNIQUE HERITAGE OF THE
COLBERT NATION THAT CANNOTCHANGE.
BUT I AM WILLING TO SHOW THEASIAN COMMUNITY I CARE BY
INTRODUCING THE "CHING-CHONGDING-DONG FOUNDATION FOR
SENSITIVITY TO ORIENTALS ORWHATEVER"
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )IT IS A WONDERFUL CHARITY.
THANK YOU.
( APPLAUSE )I WILL APPLAUD MY SENSITIVITY AS
WELL.
IT'S A WONDERFUL CHARITY THAT'SALREADY PROVIDED 3,000 OF THOSE
TRIANGLE HATS TO ASIAN AMERICANSIN NEED.
I ASSUME THERE'S A NEED  ECAUSEI NEVER SEE THEM WEARING THOSE
THINGS ANYMORE.
AND I OWE ALL THIS SENSITIVITYTO REDSKINS OWNER DANIEL SNYDER.
SO, ASIANS, SEND YOUR THANK YOULETTERS TO HIM, NOT ME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
