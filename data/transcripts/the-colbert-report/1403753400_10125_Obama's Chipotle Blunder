CRISP, CLEAN...THANK YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN.

NATION, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAHAS BEEN ONE BIG NATIONAL
DISGRACE.
FIRST IT WAS THE EMBARRASSINGMOM JEANS.
THEN THERE WAS THE EMBARRASSINGMOM BLOUSE AND THE EMBARRASSING
MOM HAIRDO.
THEN THERE WAS THEEMBARRASSING REALIZATION THAT
I WAS LOOKING AT A PHOTO OF MYMOM.
[LAUGHTER]THANKS A LOT, OBAMA.
FOLKS, HIS BIGGEST BLUNDER YETCAME AT A RECENT VISIT TO
A WASHINGTON CHIPOTLE.
>> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.
SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT?
>> OH, YEAH.
>> HE ACTUALLY REACHED OVER THESNEEZE GUARD.
>> HE REACHED OVER THE SNEEZEGUARD.
THAT'S JUST NOT COOL.
>> Stephen: IT'S MORE THANJUST NOT COOL.
THIS PROVES THAT OBAMA CARESNOTHING ABOUT BORDER SECURITY.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]AND ADDING INSULT TO GUACAMOLE,
WHICH I BELIEVE IS 75 CENTSEXTRA, JUST LOOK AT WHAT OBAMA
WAS POINTING AT.
THE MILD SALSA.
THAT SENDS A SIGNAL TO OURENEMIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT
OUR PRESIDENT IS WEAK.
RONALD WILSON REAGAN COULD CHUGAN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF HABANERO
AND TWO HOURS LATER HE'D BEWHISTLING THE STAR SPANGLED
BANNER OUT OF HIS FLAMINGBUNGHOLE.
LONG MAY IT WAVE.
AND WE WERE SO CLOSE TO HAVING ATRUE COMMANDER-IN-BEEF.
JUST LOOK AT THIS 2012 PHOTO OFMITT ROMNEY ORDERING AT A
CHIPOTLE.
THAT'S HOW YOU ORDERHYGIENICALLY, FOLKS, POLITE
DISTANCE, HANDS IN POCKETS,WEARING A CONDOM, ONE IMAGINES.
