NATION, STAY SAURON, STAY.
NATION, 29 DAYS AGO COLBERT
SUPERPAC BEGAN ITS MISSION
OF MAKING A BETTER TOMORROW
TOMORROW.
AND THAT MISSION IS AS
IMPORTANT NOW NOW AS IT WAS
THEN THEN.
WE HAVE RECEIVED DONATIONS
FROM OVER 10,000 NAMELESS
HEROES WHOSE NAMES ARE RIGHT
DOWN HERE.
BUT I WANT TO SALUTE TWO NEW
MEMBERS OF THE COLBERT YOUTH
CORPS WHO SENT ME THIS
LETTER.
THEY SCRIBBLE DEAR STEPHEN
COLE BETTER THE FIRST TIME
WE SAW YOU YOU WERE THE
ASSISTANCE SPORTS
PSYCHOLOGIST FOR THE U.S.
SPEED SKATING TEAM GIVING
ADVICE TO A SKATER'S BUTT.
OUR PARENTS RECORD YOUR SHOW
AND LET US WATCH THE BEST
PARTS.
THE LETTER CONCLUDES, THANK
YOU FOR READING THIS.
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER SINCERELY
CHARLIE, 10, AND GRACE 8.
PS, WE COLLECTED MONEY FOR
YOUR SUPERPAC.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND HERE IT IS.
$13.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, SOMETIMES
YOU FORGET WHY YOU DO WHAT
YOU DO.
(LAUGHTER)
HERE IT IS.
IT'S FOR THE CHILDREN THAT I
WANT TO RECEIVE UNLIMITED
MONIES THAT CAN THEN BE USED
TO TAMPER WITH THE 2012
ELECTIONS.
SO NATION, IT IS TIME TIME
TO MAKE AN ADDITION TO THE
CRAWL OF HEROES, LET'S
FREEZE THE CRAWL.
JIMMY, PUT THEM IN.
AND FIRE IT BACK UP.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, CHARLIE AND
GRACE.
THIS PART HERE IS ADORABLE.
THEY WANT TO DO A LEMONADE
STAND FOR THE SUPER-PAC.
THEY WRITE MOM SAYS WE CAN'T
DO A LEMONADE STAND FOR IT
UNTIL YOU DECIDE WHAT THE
SUPER-PAC STANDS FOR.
SO LET US KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S EASY.
IT STANDS FOR FREEDOM, AND
LIBERTY, AND FREEBERTY.
HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT IT
STANDS FOR.
ALL I KNOW IS THAT CITIZENS
UNITED SAID THAT UNLIMITED
MONEY IS UNLIMITED SPEECH SO
YOU I FORMED THE SUPER-PAC
AND PEOPLE ARE HANDING ME
MONEY, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.
NOW I GOT THIS HUGE MONEY
MOUSE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT IT SAYS.
I DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT I
SAY.
-- DON'T LIKE PEANUT BUTTER
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, I DON'T
KNOW.
MY MOUTH SAID IT AND THEN I
MADE UP T-SHIRTS WITH PAC
MONEY.
(APPLAUSE)
WE'LL HAVE THESE FOR SALE
LATER ON THE WEB SITE.
OH MY GOD I'M LETTING THESE
CHILDREN DOWN.
>> AH!
