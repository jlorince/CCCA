FOR YOU TO SIGN ON THE WAY OUT.
FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT IS DAY
46 OF OKAY PAY WALL STREET AND
IT IS A DISORGANIZED MESS.
I MEAN THINK OF IT.
AT THIS POINT, THE TEA PARTY
ALREADY HAD THEIR OWN NEWS
NETWORK.
THEY HAD THE BACKING OF FORMER
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER DICK
ARMEY AND HIS POLITICAL ACTION
COMMITTEE FREEDOM WORKS.
HE FUNNELED SO MUCH CASH TO THE
TEA PARTYERS THAT THEY WERE ABLE
TO UPGRADE THEIR TRICORN HATS TO
QUAD CORN.
AND SOON THE TEA PARTY BECAME
DICK ARMEY'S DICK ARMEY.
WELL, I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY
WE IN THE COLBERT SUPERPAC CAN'T
BECOME PLAYAS WITH THE WALL
STREET OCCUPYYAS BY THROWING OUR
CASH AROUND.
SO RECENTLY I WENT DOWN THERE TO
MAKE THEM AN OFFER I COULDN'T
REFUSE.
LAST NIGHT I SHOWED YOU PART
ONE.
TONIGHT, IN A SURPRISE TWIST,
PART TWO.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> PREVIOUSLY ON STEPHEN COLBERT
OCCUPIES OCCUPY WALL STREET.
I WENT DEEP UNDERCOVER IN
ZUCOTTI PARK AND I MET TWO YOUNG
REBELS-- JUSTIN AND KETCHUP.
I INVITED THEM TO MY PENTHOUSE
SUITE AND OFFERED TO CO-OPT THE
MOVEMENT FOR THEIR OWN
WELL-BEING.
(LAUGHTER)
I WORRY ABOUT YOU ESPECIALLY,
JUSTIN.
KETCHUP CAN TAKE CARE OF
HERSELF.
SHE'S TOUGH.
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT KETCHUP.
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE CAN TAKE SOME
PUNISHMENT.
YOU, JUSTIN, YOU I'M WORRY
ABOUT.
YOU'RE FRAGILE.
LET ME BE YOUR SUGAR DADDY.
AND NOW DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF
MY CO-OCCUPATION.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING I WANT.
I'LL BE OPEN.
YOU HAVE A MOVEMENT.
I WANTED IN ON THE TEA PARTY BUT
I DRAGGED MY FEET AND DICK ARMEY
JUMPED ON IT WITH FREEDOM WORKS
AND I FEEL LIKE A TOOL FOR NOT
GETTING A PIECE OF THAT.
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS, ANY
BOOTS ON THE GROUND ON THIS ONE?
>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN GIVE
THAT TO YOU, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GIVE IT TO ME, I'M GOING TO PAY
FOR IT.
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR MONEY.
IT'S ABOUT THE THING WE'RE
TRYING TO BUILD HERE AND IT
DOESN'T REQUIRE YOUR SUPERPAC
MONEY.
>> Stephen: EXCUSE ME, I'M
SORRY.
OH, HEY, COME ON IN.
HEY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS YOSHI.
SHE WIESE THE SUPERPAC AND SHE'S
SHE'S OUR MASSEUSE.
THIS IS JUSTIN AND THIS IS
KETCHUP.
OR CATSU IN YOUR LANGUAGE.
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
>> IT FEELS GOOD, I GUESS.
>> Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT SOME
OF THE POPULAR DISCONTENT THAT
YOU'VE HEARD THE PEOPLE ON THE
STREET ARE FEELING.
>> JUST A LOT OF FRUSTRATION, A
LOT OF ANGER.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
GREATEST REMEDY FOR THIS ANGER
IS?
KETCHUP?
>> WHAT DO I THINK THE REMEDY
IS?
>> Stephen: YOSHI.
>> I THINK WE NEED TO START--
(LAUGHS)
I THINK WE NEED TO START FROM
THE GROUND....
>> Stephen: DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?
>> IT DOES.
THAT WE NEED TO START FROM THE
GROUND UP.
>> Stephen: I'M JUST SAYING LET
THE SUPERPAC HELP YOU AND THIS
IS HOW WE'RE ROLLING ALL THE
TIME.
POPPING THE CHAMPAGNE, YOSHI'S
ON THE JET.
THIS TIME TOMORROW YOU COULD BE
HAVING A MASSAGE IN LONDON
TALKING ABOUT THE DOWNTRODDEN.
FROM UP HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING.
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, STEPHEN
I THINK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET
OUR MESSAGE OUT PRETTY WELL ON
OUR OWN SO FAR.
>> Stephen:.
THANK YOU, YOSHI.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>>.
>> Stephen: (SPEAKS JAPANESE)
CAN WE GET REAL FOR A SECOND?
I'M OFFERING YOU MY SHOW TO PUMP
THE MESSAGE.
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO, YOU KNOW,
JUST TWEAK IT.
I EVEN MADE UP A SIGN FOR YOU.
"CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PEOPLE."
THAT'S A SIGN, RIGHT?
YOU BELIEVE IN THAT?
>> I BELIEVE THAT.
>> Stephen: OKAY, LET'S JUST
TWEAK IT.
CORPORATIONS ARE... ARE NOW
PEOPLE.
>> IT'S NOT A TWEAK, THOUGH.
THAT'S A BIG IMPORTANT CHANGE.
>> Stephen: BUT THE SUPREME
COURT HAS RULED THE CORPORATIONS
ARE PEOPLE.
THEREFORE THEY ARE.
AND YOU SAYING THEY'RE NOT IS
DEHUMANIZING.
SEE HOW YOU'RE THE MONOER?
>> THEY'RE JUST NOT PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: IT JUST SEEMS PRETTY
RACIST OF YOU TO SAY, OH,
CERTAIN PEOPLE DON'T GET TO BE
PEOPLE.
A CORPORATION OWNS WHAT YOU'RE
PARK THAT YOU'RE ON RIGHT NOW.
>> WELL, THE THING THAT OWNS THE
PARK....
>> Stephen: YOU UNDERSTAND HOW
UGLY THAT SIGNS?
HEY, BOY, WHERE'S MY SHRIMP?
>> I THINK WE'RE MOVING AWAY
FROM THE AGENDA ITEM.
>> Stephen: THE AGENDA ITEM IS
SHE'S A RACIST.
WHY NOT LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD
BY GETTING SOME MONEY OF YOUR
OWN!
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT FIRE WITH
FIRE.
THAT'S JESUS.
>> THAT'S NOT SOMETHING JESUS
SAID.
>> Stephen: JESUS SAID FIGHT
FIRE WITH FIRE.
HE ALSO SAID MONEY TALKS, BULL
(BLEEP) WALKS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE'VE HAD LOTS OF LARGE
DONATIONS AND PROBABLY WILL
CONTINUE TO HAVE LARGE DONATIONS
BUT THAT DOES NOT GIVE THE
PERSON WHO DONATES IT ANY SORT
OF SWAY OR INFLUENCE.
>> Stephen: RIGHT.
BECAUSE WHAT I'M SAYING IS I
UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE VALUES.
AND I'M WILLING TO WORK AROUND
THOSE.
>> YOU CAN'T WORK AROUND THE
VALUES.
>> Stephen: WELL, DOES THAT EVEN
CHANGE THE MESSAGE?
LET'S KEEP THE MESSAGE.
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
CORPORATIONS AREN'T PEOPLE.
WHO GIVES A FLYING FIG LEAF.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: I KNOW YOU DO AND I
BELIEVE IN THAT.
AND SO DOES MY MONEY.
>> WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
>> FINE, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT
A FEW MOVEMENTS THAT ALSO DIDN'T
WANT ANY CORPORATE BACKING.
TELL ME IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF
THEM.
YOU EVER HEARD OF THE LEFTY
LUCYS?
OR THE MILLION MAN MAMBO?
YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT THEM
>> NO.
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
HAVE ANY MONEY BACKING THEM.
MILLIONS COULD HAVE MARCHED ON
WASHINGTON TWO YEARS AGO, MAMBO
DOWN THE MALL, YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD ABOUT IT.
>> IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
>> Stephen: AS FAR AS YOU KNOW
IT DIDN'T.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE
WORLD.
LET'S CHANGE THE WORLD.
LET'S IT THIS GROUND.
LET'S DO THIS THING.
LET'S DANCE ON THE EDGE OF A
KNIFE.
>> THE PROBLEM....
>> Stephen: LET'S LIVE
DANGEROUSLY.
LET'S GET INTO IT.
LET'S STRAP ON AND GET ON TOP.
TOP OF OUR GAME.
GET THE MESSAGE OUT THERE.
LET'S BE EMPOWERED.
LET'S LET THE LITTLE MAN
RECOVERY!
I'M A BIG MAN WHO'S GOING TO
HELP YOU DO THAT.
>> WE'RE NOT TRYING TO RECREATE
THE PROBLEMS THAT ALREADY EXIST.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THE
UNDERINFLUENCE OF MONEY IN
POLITICS SO FOR US TO ACCEPT
LARGE DONATIONS FROM YOU OR
ANYBODY WOULD BE CREATING THAT
PROBLEM.
>> Stephen: I WAS MAN ENOUGH TO
KNOW WHEN I'D BEEN BEATEN.
THE REVOLUTION WOULD NOT BE
TELEVISED.
KETCHUP, JUSTIN, I KNOW YOU GUYS
HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE
REVOLUTION.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO
ME.
>> THANK YOU.
THANKS, STEPHEN.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: NO, SERIOUS.
THAT'S YOUR MONEY.
>> NO, NO.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: SO WILL THEY TAKE ME
UP ON MY SNAUFR SINCE THAT
INTERVIEW, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
REPORTS THE GROUP HAS RAISED
OVER
$450,000.
SO WHO GAVE THEM THAT MONEY?
HERE'S A LITTLE HINT.
HE'S GOT TWO THUMBS AND SO DO I.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
