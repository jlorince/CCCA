MARRY BEFORE YOU WANT TO.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT
ISSUE TO VOTERS THIS YEAR,
CONTRACEPTION.
THIS AFFRONT IT IS DECENCY COMES IN MANY FORMS-- CONDOMS, THE PILL, THE DIE GRAPH, THE SPONGE,
THE CHAMOIS.
(LAUGHTER) NOW AS A CATHOLIC I ENDORSE ONLY THE RHYTHM METHOD WHICH IS WHEN
YOU DO IT WHILE LISTENING TO THE MIAMI SOUND MACHINE.
WATCH OUT, SPERM, THE RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YA!
(LAUGHTER) NOW, OBAMACARE MANDATES THAT ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE TO COVER CONTRACEPTIVES.
SO LAST WEEK CONGRESS HELD HEARINGS FEATURING A WHO'S WHO OF WHO DOESN'T HAVE OVARIES.
(LAUGHTER) DEMOCRATS WANTED GEORGETOWN LAW STUDENT SANDRA FLUKE TO TESTIFY.
WELL, REPUBLICANS COULDN'T ALLOW THAT.
THESE WOMEN GET ALL EMOTIONAL ABOUT THEIR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.
SO THE DIRTY DEMS HELD A SPECIAL SESSION WHICH MS. FLUKE SPOKE IN FAVOR OF CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE.
THAT ANGERED RADIO HOST AND POSTER BOY FOR CONTRACEPTION RUSH LIMBAUGH.
(LAUGHTER) JIM
>>?
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT COLLEGE COED SUSAN FLUKE WHO GOES BEFORE
A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE AND ESSENTIALLY SAYS SHE MUST BE PAID TO HAVE SEX?
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE HER?
IT MAKES HER A SLUT, RIGHT?
MAKES HER A PROSTITUTE.
>> Stephen: GOOD POINT, RUSH.
SHE'S A SLUT AND A PROSTITUTE.
THAT'S TWO JOBS AND SHE STILL CAN'T AFFORD HER OWN BIRTH CONTROL?
COME ON!
NOW THERE'S AN OLD SAYING IN RADIO "WE'VE GOT THREE HOURS TO
FILL, KEEP TALKING." AND HE DID.
>> SO MS. FLUKE-- AND THE REST OF YOU FEMME NAZIS, HERE'S THE
DEAL, IF WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR CONTRACEPTIVES AND THUS PAY FOR YOU TO HAVE SEX WE WANT
SOMETHING FOR IT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.
POST THE VIDEOS ONLINE SO WE CAN ALL WATCH.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, IF THE TAX PAYER ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT, WE SHOULD WATCH.
THERE SHOULD BE A DEDICATED YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR MEDICARE PATIENT'S COLONOSCOPIES.
COME ON, MR. WINE GARDENER, WE PAID FOR A PEEK AT THOSE POLYPS,
YOU BUTT SLUT.
(LAUGHTER) FOLKS, RUSH WASN'T JUST NAME CALLING!
HE WAS CONCERNED!
>> SHE'S HAVING SO MUCH SEX SHE CAN'T AFFORD HER OWN BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.
MS. FLUKE, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF NOT HAVING SEX?
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF NOT HAVING SEX SO OFTEN?
>> Stephen: YES.
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PILL WORKS!
THE MORE SEX YOU HAVE, THE MORE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS YOU HAVE TO TAKE.
IT'S ONE FOR EACH SPERM.
THEY ACT LIKE LITTLE BABY DEFLECTORS.
(LAUGHTER) AND RUSH KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE EVERY TIME HE'S
HAD SEX WITH A WOMAN HE'S HAD TO SLIP HER A PILL FIRST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, YOU CALL ONE WOMAN YOU'VE NEVER MET A SLUT AND A
PROSTITUTE AND DEMAND SHE POST AN INTERNET GANG BANG TAPE AND SUDDENLY THE LAME STREAM MEDIA
IS JUMPING DOWN YOUR THROAT IF THERE WERE ROOM IN THERE WITH ALL THAT HAM.
(LAUGHTER) SO NATURALLY THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WERE CALLED UPON TO
REPUDIATE RUSH, AND THEY DID SO IN NO CERTAIN TERMS.
>> IT'S A BIT ABSURD BUT THAT'S... AN ENTERTAINER CAN BE ABSURD.
>> IT'S NOT THE LANGUAGE I WOULD HAVE USED.
>> YES, SLUT AND PROSTITUTE IS NOT THE LANGUAGE MITT WOULD HAVE USED.
HE MIGHT HAVE USED "TROLLOP" OR "WANTON HARLOT" OR "BOW LEGGED
DUMPSTER SKANK." (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, AS OF THIS BROADCAST 12 ADVERTISERS HAVE PULLED THEIR
SUPPORT FROM RUSH'S SHOW,
INCLUDING PROFLOWERS, QIBEN LOANS, SLEEP TRAIN, SLEEP NUMBER IT IS RUSSIAN SYSTEMS, CARBON
NIGHT AND LEGAL ZOOM.
NO SURPRISE THERE, FOLKS, ALL THESE PROBLEMS CLEARLY ENDORSE THE SLUT LIFE-STYLE.
MATTRESSS TO DO IT ON, FLOWERS TO THANK HER FOR THE SLUTING AND QUICKEN SPREADSHEETS TO ORGANIZE
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO SPREAD IT QUICK FOR UNDER THE SHEETS.
(APPLAUSE) AND LEGAL ZOOM WE KNOW IS JUST SHORT FOR LEGAL ZOOMA-ZOOMA-ZOOM AND A BOOM BOOM.
(LAUGHTER) BUT FACED WITH LOSING SPONSORS,
TODAY THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED.
RUSH APOLOGIZED FOR CALLING MS. FLUKE A SLUT AND A PROSTITUTE.
>> I AGAIN SINCERELY APOLOGIZE TO MS. FLUKE FOR USING THOSE TWO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HER.
I DO NOT THINK SHE IS EITHER THOSE TWO WORDS.
>> Stephen: YES, RUSH APOLOGIZED FOR USING THOSE TWO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HER.
BUT HE STILL STANDS BEHIND EVERYTHING ELSE HE SAID.
>> SANDRA FLUKE IS HAVING SO MUCH SEX THAT SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT.
SHE WANTS ALL THE SEX IN THE WORLD, WHEREVER SHE WANTS IT ALL THE TIME.
THEY'RE LINED UP AROUND THE BLOCK.
WE'RE TALKING SEX ADDICT FREQUENCY.
IT'S IMMORAL.
BASELESS.
NO PURPOSE TO HER LIFE.
MS. FLUKE, WHO BOUGHT YOUR CONDOMS IN JUNIOR HIGH?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MAN HAS GONE THROUGH FOUR WIVES.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT, FOLKS, I WILL TELL YOU, I DON'T THINK RUSH SHOULD HAVE
APOLOGIZED FOR CALLING HER A PROSTITUTE!
I MEAN, IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE!
(LAUGHTER) AND, REMEMBER, HE ONLY APOLOGIZED TO KEEP
