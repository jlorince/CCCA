(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY.
WELCOME BACK!
NATION, AS YOU MAY KNOW,
TOMORROW IS THE MOST ROMANTIC
HOLIDAY OF THE YEAR.
IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S AMERICONE
DREAM AT PARTICIPATING BEN &
JERRY'S SHOPS NATIONWIDE DAY.
IT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO
SAY "I LIKE A BIG ASS."
(LAUGHTER)
TOMORROW ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
VALENTINE'S DAY, THE PERFECT
TIME TO REFLECT ON YOUR LOVED
ONES AND YOUR HATE-ONES.
FOR INSTANCE, MY ETERNAL ENEMY
FOR SIX MONTHS UNTIL MARCH 3,
JIMMY FALLON.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
NICE.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU SEE, MARCH 3 OF LAST YEAR,
JIMMY CAME ON MY SHOW TO
CELEBRATE HIS NEW BEN & JERRY'S
ICE CREAM FLAVOR LATE NIGHT
SNACK.
IT'S VANILLA ICE CREAM WITH
SALTED CARAMEL AND FUDGE-COVERED
POTATO CHIP CLUSTERS.
ALSO THE SAME INGREDIENTS OF A
CLEVELAND STEAMER.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUE STORY.
THAT NIGHT JIMMY AND I BECAME
BEST FRIENDS FOREVER FOR SIX
MONTHS.
LAST FALL JIMMY BROKE MY HARD
WHEN HE HAD BEN AND JERRY ON HIS
SHOW TO SAY THIS "THE BIG ISSUE
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS I'M
OUTSELLING STEPHEN COLBERT'S ICE
CREAM.
>> THE FLAVOR IS DOING VERY,
VERY WELL.
IT T SHORT ANSWER IS YES, IT'S
OUTSELLING.
>> THAT'S RIGHT!
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Stephen: JIMMY OUTSELLING ME?
WHO WHO'S BUYING IT?
ARE MORGUES USING IT TO CHILL
THE CORPSES?
(LAUGHTER)
SO THEN JIMMY AND I BECAME
ETERNAL ENEMIES FOR SIX MONTHS
AND I URGED YOU TO GET OUT THERE
AND BUY SOME DELICIOUS AMERICONE
DREAM.
I WANT TO BEAT JIMMY FALLON LIKE
A RENTED MULE!
MULE, BY THE WAY, ALSO A MAJOR
INGREDIENT IN LATE NIGHT SNACK.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST THINK, JUST THINK, THIS GUY
WAS EVER MY BEST FRIEND FOR SIX
MONTHS.
OH, JIMMY.
HOW LONG MUST WE FIGHT THIS
SENSELESS WAR PITTING BROTHER
AGAINST BROTHER, HOST AGAINST
HOST?
CARAMEL SWIRL AGAINST SALTED
CARAMEL SWIRL?
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S... THIS MADNESS HAS TO END.
MAYBE
>> MAYBE I SHOULD REACH OUT TO
HIM.
FOLKS, SHOULD I SEND JIMMY A
VALENTINE'S CARD?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> LET'S DO IT, LET'S DO IT.
OKAY.
GOOD IDEA, GOOD PEOPLE.
I'LL GET MY CARD STACK HERE.
GET WELL, GET WORSE.
(LAUGHTER)
TO A SPECIAL NEPHEW UPON HIS
PAROLE.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, HERE WE
GO.
VALENTINE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
"MY DEAREST JIMMYEST.
I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ETERNAL ENEMIES UNTIL MARCH 3,
BUT WITHOUT YOU I FEEL LIKE
VANILLA ICE CREAM WITH SALTED
CARAMEL AND FUDGE-COVERED POTATO
CHIP CLUSTERS.
TERRIBLE.
(LAUGHTER)
SOMETIMES I LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT
WISHING FOR A GLIMPSE OF YOUR
FACE.
BY I ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP BEFORE
YOUR SHOW COMES ON.
(LAUGHTER)
SO I HOPE YOU'LL ACCEPT THIS
TOKEN OF OUR FRIENDSHIP AND
LET'S BE BEST BUDS AGAIN.
PLEASE READ THIS NEXT SENTENCE
IN A WHISER THE.
I MISS US.
SINCERELY YOURS, THE REVEREND
SIR DR. STEPHEN T. MOS DEF
COLBERT B.F.A., DICTATED NOT
READ."
(LAUGHTER)
NOW I'LL SEND THIS TO JIMMY
USING THE LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW
INTERNAL MAIL SYSTEM.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
JIMMY FALLON.
FALLON, NOT KIMMEL.
FALLON.
GO!
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S SLOW NOW BUT ONCE HE TAKES
OFF HE'S LICKETY-SPLIT.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
