>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
NATION, IT'S NO SECRET THE
MIDDLE EAST IS UNSTABLE.
IT'S A TIME BOMB THAT'S NOT
WEARING A CONDOM.
THE LATEST DANGER COMES FROM
MAHMOUD
AHMA-WE-JUST-WON-AN-EMMY-IJAD.
HE HAS JUST UNVEILED A
LONG-RANGE, UNMANNED DRONE THAT
CAN FIRE UP TO FOUR CRUISE
MISSILES.
FOR MORE LET'S GO TO FOX AND
FRIENDS SPARE BLONDE.
>> NEW VIDEO OF IRAN'S DRONE
THAT'S BEING LAUNCHED INTO THE
SKY.
IRANIAN PRESIDENT MAHMOUD
AHMADINEJAD CALLS THE DROWN
"IRAN'S AMBASSADOR OF DEATH."
>> Stephen: AMBASSADOR OF
DEATH.
WITH DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, IT
COULD PARK ANYWHERE.
BUT THE MOST DISTURBING THING
WAS HOW THEY UNVEILED IT.
WITH CARDBOARD CLOUDS, PAINTED
BACK DROPS AND FAKE SNOW.
NATION, THE DAY WE FEARED IS
FINALLY HERE.
IRAN HAS ACQUIRED DIORAMA
TECHNOLOGY.
AND CLEARLY THIS MISSILE IS
TARGETED FOR THE NEANDERTHAL
EXHIBIT AT THE NATURAL HISTORY
MUSEUM.
MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE, THE UNITED
STATES...
[APPLAUSE]
MEANWHILE, THE UNITED STATES
HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED ON ITS
DIORAMA.
AND IT'S DUE MONDAY FIRST
PERIOD.
SO ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN IT
FALLS TO ME TO PROTECT AMERICA.
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT MAKING THIS
THING.
FULL DISCLOSURE, I GOT SOME HELP
FROM MY MOM.
OKAY.
NOW, IN THIS SHOEBOX IS
AMERICA'S RESPONSE TO IRAN'S
DIORAMA AGGRESSION.
OKAY.
LET'S GET A SHOT IN THERE,
JIMMY.
IF WE CAN FIRE THIS THING UP,
LET ME SEE, WHAT DO WE HAVE
HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S PUT THAT LIKE THAT.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S ME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THERE'S ME RIDING A DINOSAUR,
AIMING A TRIDENT AT MAHMOUD
MAHMOUD
ACHMA-HE'S-REALLY-THAT-SHORT-IJAD
WAIT, WAIT.
WHO IS THIS COMING TO HELP ME?
IT'S BOBA FETT.
YES, OUT OF HIS ORIGINAL
PACKAGING.
ARE YOU SHAKING YET, IRAN?
OKAY.
WELL, HOW ABOUT IF WE ATTACKED
YOU DURING A SNOWSTORM?
HUH?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
OH.
OH.
OH, IT'S SO COLD, IT'S SO COLD.
LOOK, IT'S HUGE SNOW.
REALLY BIG SNOW.
OKAY.
AND IF YOU STILL REFUSE TO
SURRENDER, WE MAY HAVE TO NUKE
YOU.
[MAKING EXPLOSION NOISES]
OR PERHAPS USE A BIOLOGICAL
WEAPON -- THIS RECALLED EGG.
[LAUGHTER]
VICTORY IS OURS!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MAN, THAT WAS FUN.
ONE THING THAT'S NOT FUN IS IRAN
WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
RUSSIA HAS GIVEN THEM FUEL RODS
FOR THEIR NUCLEAR REACTOR, BUT
THEY'VE REASSURED THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT
RUSSIA WILL KEEP CLOSE TABS ON
THE PLANT AND RECOVER ANY
RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS, WHICH
THEY WILL THEN SAFELY DISPOSE OF
IN THE SUSHI OF THEIR
JOURNALISTS.
NOW, IN RESPONSE TO THIS, ISRAEL
IS THREATENING TO LAUNCH AN AIR
RAID THAT WILL JACK-SLAP IRAN
INTO THE NEXT SHAW BASS.
WILL THEY, IN FACT, DO IT?
I'LL FIND OUT IN TWO MINUTES
WHEN I TALK TO REPORTER FOR "THE
ATLANTIC" JEFFREY GOLDBERG ABOUT
THE POSSIBILITY OF A WAR WITH
NUCLEAR IRAN.
AND IF THIS PROVES TO BE OUR
LAST NIGHT ON EARTH, WE MAY DO
