FINGERS CROSSED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: NOW NATION-- IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN A SLUGGISH
AS A SLUG IN A SLUG CONVENTION.
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD I HAD TO FIRE MY METAPHOR WRITER.
WELL, FOLKS,--  (LAUGHTER) I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AND SOME BAD NEWS.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S PLENTY OF BAD NEWS WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER) YOU SEE THE CORNERSTONE OF MIFT'S CAMPAIGN IS THAT HE
CAN FIX OBAMA'S BROKE OWN ECONOMY.
SO THE WORST THINGS ARE FOR JOHN Q PUBLIC, THE BETTER THEY ARE FOR WILLARD M PRIVATE.
>> THE FEDERAL CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE SAID TODAY UNEMPLOYMENT WILL REMAIN
ABOVE 8% THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR.
>> THIS IS BAD NEWS.
>> PORE BAD JOB NEWS AND A WEAK ECONOMY IT IS.
>> THE ECONOMY IS NOT GETTING BETTER.
>> Stephen: WHOO!
THE ECONOMY IS NOT GETTING BETTER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH,
JIMMY.
PEOPLE ARE HURTING.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR MITT ROMNEY NOT EVERYTHING IS COMING UP DEAD ROSES.
SOME KEY SWING STATES ARE ACTUALLY REBOUNDING.
AND THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS OF THOSE STATES NATURALLY WANT TO LOOK GOOD.
AND THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO GET ON THE GLOOM WAGON BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> ONE OF THE TWIN STATES,
FLORIDA, WAS DEVASTATED BY THE RECESSION BUT AS RECENTLY REBOUNDED UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND GROWN-UP BAT BOY RICK SCOTT.
WHO RECENTLY TOOTED HIS OWN HORN WITH THIS AD.
>> ACROSS FLORIDA HERE'S THE NEWS.
COMPANIES ARE HIRING,
EXPANDING, PUTTING MORE FLORIDIANS TO WORK.
FLORIDA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONTINUES TO GET BETTER.
NOW AT A THREE YEAR LOW,
FLORIDA'S GETTING BACK TO WORK.
>> Stephen: NOW GOOD FOR HIM.
BUT FOLKS, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
ONE POLLSTER WHEN HE SAW THAT COMMERCIAL SAID, I INITIALLY THOUGHT IT WAS AN OBAMA AD.
AND MANY ELDERLY FLORIDA VOTERS ARE ALREADY EASILY CONFUSED.
(LAUGHTER) KUZ YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY THINK ARE AD FORCE OBAMA?
THESE.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN KNEW THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
NOW ACCORDING-- ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG NEWS, THEY HAVE ASKED GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT TO
DOWNPLAY FLORIDA'S JOB GAINS.
BECAUSE IT ONLY HELP OS BAMA WHO PAINTS A ROSY PICTURE.
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
GOVERNOR SCOTT WON'T SAY FLORIDA SUCKS.
BECAUSE-- JUST HOURS AFTER THAT BLOOMBERG REPORT, THE FLORIDA REPUBLICAN PARTY
RELEASED A MEMO SAYING FLORIDA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPPED FOR THE 11th
CONSECUTIVE MONTH AND NOW IS AT 8.6%.
THAT'S THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN SINCE DECEMBER 2008.
IX-NAY ON THE OO-THOUSAND-EIGHT TAY.
S AWAY, ESIDENT PRAY USH BAYH.
>> NOW FOLKS T IS SO IMPORTANT T IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSERVATIVES ALL
SING FROM THE SAME HYMNAL.
I MEAN EVERYBODY.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THIS DESTRUCTIVELY UPBEAT CLIP ON FOX NEWS.
>> 80s ACROSS THE 12R58 PLAINS, 60s UP NORTH.
IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
>> Stephen: NO, THAT'S OBAMA'S BEAUTIFUL DAY!
REMEMBER, IT'S NOT PARTLY SUNNY, IT'S PARTLY CANCEROUS WITH A CHANCE OF YOUR WIFE
LEAVING YOU FOR RAMONE THE POOL BOY.
AND EVEN, EVEN IF THERE IS GOOD NEWS WE'VE GOT TO SPIN IT IN THE WORST POSSIBLE
LIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT.
FOR INSTANCE, IN THOSE FEW STATES THAT HAVE ADDED JOBS,
JUST FOCUS ON WHAT A DRAG IT IS TO HAVE TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY.
HEY, LET'S GO OUT AND PARTY.
OH WAIT, I HAVE TO GO TO WORK TOMORROW.
THANKS A LOT, OBAMA.
FOLKS, I BELIEVE TO GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK WE HAVE TO DRAG EVERYONE DOWN IN THE DUMPS.
AND I'M READY TO DO MY PART.
>> GREAT NEWS FROM THE WOODLAND PARK ZOO IN SEATTLE,
WASHINGTON.
DUE TO A HEART DEFECT A RARE BABY SNOW LEOPARD HAS BEEN EUTHANIZED.
HE WAS SO YOUNG, HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A NAME.
ROMNEY 2012.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT MITT CAN WIN IS TO REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING, IF
IT AIN'T BROKE, INSIST THAT IT IS AND MAYBE THEY'LL HIRE YOU TO FIX IT.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
