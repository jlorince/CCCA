>> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
"REPORT," EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IS (CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN")
>> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
YOU KNOW, THAT IS REALLY LOVELY
TO HEAR.
YOU KNOW, I AM NOT ONE TO CALL
ATTENTION TO MYSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT EVERY TIME I GO TO GOOGLE
NEWS AND TYPE IN "STEPHEN
COLBERT" IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY
STORY IS ABOUT ME.
(LAUGHTER)
NO, THIS TIME IT'S ABOUT MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH FORMER
GODFATHER'S PIZZA C.E.O.
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE HERMAN CANE.
NOW, I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF HERMAN
CAIN EVER SINCE I SAW HIS
COUNTRY-ROCKING CAMPAIGN LAUNCH
VIDEO.
JIM?
♪ GET ON BOARD THE HERMAN CAIN
TRAIN ♪
>> Stephen: WHOO!
GET ON THE HERMAN CAIN TRAIN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT
RHYMES.
AND IT'S MUCH CATCHIER THAN
"STEP ON INTO THE RON PAUL
SHOWER STALL."
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
SO NATURALLY I WAS PSYCHED WHEN
MR. CAIN AGREED TO COME ON MY
SHOW.
CAIN IS GOING TO BE MY GUEST ON
THURSDAY, JULY 28.
WRITE THAT ON YOUR IPAD IN INK!
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, I HOPE YOU WROTE THAT ON
YOUR IPAD IN ERASABLE INK
BECAUSE YESTERDAY HERMAN CAIN
CANCELED ON ME.
(BOOS)
IT'S THE SECOND TIME CAIN HAS
CANCELED.
AND I...
(LAUGHTER).
I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
HERMAN CAIN, I AM NOT SOME PIZZA
CRUST YOU CAN JUST LEAVE ON YOUR
PLATE AND MOVE ON TO A HOTTER
SLICE.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT, HERMAN?
YOU CAN'T CANCEL ON ME BECAUSE
I'M CANCELING YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW I'M
SEEING SOMEONE ELSE THURSDAY
NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE BUDDY ROMER.
ALL RIGHT THIS IS NOT JUST SOME
REBOUND, EITHER.
I REALLY LIKE BUDDY ROMER.
IS THAT HIM?
GOOD, GOOD BECAUSE I LIKE HIM.
HE'S A FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND A
ONE-TERM GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.
THAT'S RIGHT, HERMAN, BUDDY'S
ACTUALLY HELD ELECTIVE OFFICE.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IT'S OVER HERMAN.
DID HERMAN CALL?
NO?
FINE, GOOD.
BECAUSE BUDDY ROEMER IS MY GUY
NOW.
AND I KNOW I SAID HERMAN CAIN IS
MY GUY.
BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK-- AND
I NEVER THOUGHT I MIGHT SAY
THIS-- HERMAN CAIN MIGHT NOT BE
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
