SO
(LAUGHTER)
I HAD WON THE VOTE FOLKS,
BUT I WOULD NOT OFFICIALLY
HAVE A SUPERPAC UNTIL MY
PAPERS FOR THE SUPERPAC WERE
FILED WITH THE SECRETARY OF
THE FEC.
>> NO SUPERPAC YET.
STILL NO SUPERPAC.
NO, OH, IT'S JUST A
HANDSHAKE.
NO SUPERPAC YET.
PAPERWORK'S STILL TO COME.
AND SUPERPAC!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
NEWLY AND SUPERPACKED T WAS
TIME TO HEAD OUTSIDE AND
ADDRESS THE COLBERT
SUPERNATION.
HELLO, NATION.
>> HELLO!
>> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
>> Stephen: I AM HERE TO
REPRESENT YOUR VOICE.
SO PLEASE QUIET DOWN SO WE
CAN ALL HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY WITH MY MOUTH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: FILL OWE
AMERICANS, LADIES AND YES,
SUPPORTERS, FRIENDS, AND
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WITH
EXTREMELY GENEROUS LUNCH
BREAK POLICIES, 60 DAYS AGO
TODAY, ON THIS VERY SPOT A
YOUNG MAN PETITIONED THE FEC
FOR PERMISSION TO FORM A
SUPERPAC TO RAISE UNLIMITED
MONIES AND USE THE MONEYS TO
DETERMINE THE WINNERS OF THE
2012 ELECTIONS.
CAN ANYONE TELL ME --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: CAN ANYONE TELL
ME WHO THAT YOUNG MAN WAS.
IT WAS ME.
NOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE
CYNICALLY ASKED IS THIS SOME
KIND MUCH JOKE?
WELL, I FOR ONE DON'T THINK
THAT PARTICIPATING IN DEM
OBLING -- DEMOCRACY IS A
JOKE.
I DON'T THINK THAT WANTING
TO KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE
IS A JOKE.
BUT I DO HAVE ONE FEDERAL
ELECTION LAW JOKE IF YOU
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: KNOCK, KNOCK.
>> WHO'S THERE?
>> Stephen: UNLIMITED UNIONS
AND CORPORATE CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS.
>> Stephen: UNLIMITED UNIONS
AND CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS
WHO?
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE
THING.
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE
TO TELL YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, THERE WILL BE
OTHERS WHO SAY STEPHEN
COLBERT, WHAT WILL YOU DO
WITH THAT UNRESTRICTED
SUPERPAC MONEY.
TO WHICH I SAY, I DON'T
KNOW.
GIVE IT TO ME AND LET'S FIND
OUT.
SINCE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I DO NOT ACCEPT LIMITS
ON MY FREE SPEECH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
I DO NOT ACCEPT THE STATUS
QUO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT I DO ACCEPT VISA,
MASTERCARD AND AMERICAN
EXPRESS.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
AND FOR EIGHT YETS OUT THERE,
GUESS UNDER HEIGHT, THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE
DID IT.
>> I AM A SUPERPAC AND SO
CAN YOU!
>> THEN LIKE WASHINGTON
CROSSING THE DELAWARE TO ASK
IT FOR MONEY, I WADED INTO
THE CROWD WITH A CREDIT CARD
SWIPER ATTACHED TO MY IPAD.
>> THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU.
JUST THROW IT OUT, BALL IT
UP AND THROW IT AT ME.
THANK YOU.
FOLKS, I WANT TO THANK ALL
THOSE PEOPLE WHO SWIPED
THEIR CARDS IN THE RIGHT
SLOT TODAY.
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
SWIPED IT IN THE WRONG SLOT,
THANK YOU EVEN MORE.

PART OF HISTORY BY LOGGING
