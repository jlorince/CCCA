>> Stephen: (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
MY GUEST TONIGHT RUNS THE HUFFINGTON POST WHICH JUST WON ITS FIRST PULITZER PRIZE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL ASK WHICH ONE OF ALEC BALDWIN'S BLOG POSTS CLINCHED IT.
PLEASE WELCOME ARIANNA HUFFINGTON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ARIANNA, SO LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> YOU, TOO, STEPHEN.
>> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Stephen: YOU STARTED THE HUFFINGTON POST IN 2005.
>> SAME YEAR YOU STARTED "THE COLBERT REPORT."
>> Stephen: EXACTLY.
AND YOU AND I ARE JUST RACING TOWARDS THE ACCOLADES.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, YOU KNOW, I LIKE YOU, I DON'T LIKE YOUR POLITICS, I
THINK YOU'RE A CANCER ON AMERICA.
(LAUGHTER) BUT YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE LADY SO I WANT TO SAY... I'M SURE YOU EARNED IT.
WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID THE HUFFINGTON POST WIN FOR?
WAS IT FOR NIP SLIPS?
WHAT WAS THE ARTICLE?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, STEPHEN?
I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU'RE JUST BITTER AND JEALOUS.
>> Stephen: OH, AM I?
AM ANY HOW'S YOUR PEABODY, BABY?
HOW'S YOUR PEABODY?
MAYBE MY PEABODY COULD FIGHT YOUR PULITZER.
>> THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT.
YOU JUST WON A MERE PEABODY AND WE WON A PULITZER.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT GEORGE FAWCETT PEABODY DID?
>> Stephen: HE CURED CANCER.
>> NO, HE WAS THE ANTI-COLBERT.
HE WAS AN ANTI-WAR ACTIVIST.
HE WAS THE TREASURER OF THE DEAN SEE.
HE GOT... D.N.C.
HE GOT A DEGREE FROM HARVARD.
>> Stephen: WE ALL HAVE YOUTHFUL INDISCRETIONS.
I WENT TO DARTMOUTH.
I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH.
>> I'M REALLY SURE THAT DEEP IN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS YOU WISH YOU
HAD WON A PULITZER BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT PULITZER DID?
HE ALMOST SINGLE-HANDEDLY STARTED THE SPANISH AMERICAN WAR.
>> REMEMBER THE "MAINE," BABY!
YOU'RE HAPPY THE SPANISH KILLED OUR BOYS IN THE HAVANA HARBOR.
YOU STILL HAVE PARTIES ABOUT IT WITH HILLARY!
I SAW HER DANCING, CELEBRATING THE DEATH OF THOSE MEN ON THE "MAINE."
>> YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE THERAPY.
>> Stephen: (BLEEP) ABOUT YOUR PULITZER PRIZE.
AS A WEB SITE YOU WON A PULITZER PRIZE, RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: YOU CAN ALSO WITH A PEABODY WITH A WEB SITE, RIGHT?
>> WHO NEEDS A PEABODY WHEN YOU HAVE A PULITZER?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ALL MY EMMYS AND GRAMMYS COMPANY.
>> I'M GLAD I'M HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO STOPPING A A GAITING THE
HUFFING TO BE POST-.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF OUR MATERIAL YOU USE.
>> Stephen: ALL OF IT.
PUT UP WHAT WE GOT HERE.
A YEAR AGO I STARTED THE COLBUFFINGTON REPOST.
YOU AGGREGATE FROM ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND I REAGGREGATE FROM ALL OVER YOUR WEB SITE AND... I
HOPE YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE ME MY REPULITZER.
>> JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD A TECH REPORTER RISK HIS LIFE TO
BRING TO OUR READERS AN AMAZING STORY.
THE CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT CREATED THIS REMOTE HELICOPTER AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER WE
COME AS WE ALWAYS DO TO WATCH YOUR SHOW AND WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU HAD USED THE EXACT SAME STORY FOR AN ENTIRE SEGMENT AND SOLD ADVERTISING AGAINST IT.
>> Stephen: AND THEN I WATCHED YOUR SITE THE NEXT DAY AND YOU HAD RUN MY CLIP OF ME QUOTING
YOUR WEB SITE.
(LAUGHTER) AND I BELIEVE AT THAT POINT THE INTERNET ATE ITSELF.
ARIANNA, LET'S GET TO THE SERIOUSNESS HERE.
I KNOW YOU LOVE TO MAKE JOKES BUT I WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.
THIS ARTICLE WAS ABOUT OUR TROOPS.
IT WAS BY VETERAN REPORTER DAVID WOOD CALLED "BEYOND THE BATTLEFIELD."
WHAT DOES THIS ARTICLE OUTLINE.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, IF WE CAN BE SERIOUS FOR A MOMENT, THE SAME
THING YOU DID LAST WEEK, ASKING PEOPLE HOW TO HELP OUR MILITARY FAMILIES THAT ARE IGNORED,
ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CAMPAIGN,
THAT'S WHAT DAVID WOOD'S TEN-PART SERIES ON RETURNING VET DEALING WITH THEIR STRUGGLES,
THEIR WOUNDS, THE IMPACT ON THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.
AT THE END OF THIS STORY THERE WAS AN ENTIRE STORY ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO HELP.
SO HERE YOU AND I CAN AGREE THAT A HUGE UNDERREPORTED FACT OF AMERICA THAT'S IGNORED.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Dave: SO IF YOU'RE A SUPPORTER OF OUR TROOPS WHY
DON'T YOU HAVE MORE CONSERVATIVE VOICES ON THE HUFFINGTON POST?
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE JUST LIKE OPPOSITE.
WHAT IF YOU AND RUPERT MURDOCH JUST GO TO A FIELD AND SETTLE THIS WITH PISTOLS?
>> Stephen: WHOA WHO IS WRITING YOUR QUESTIONS, JOE THE PLUMBER?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I WISH HE WAS.
I WISH HE WAS.
THE MAN'S A PATRIOT.
>> YOU'RE JUST SO BEHIND.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONSERVATIVE VOICES.
>> WE HAVE TONS.
>> Stephen: WHO?
PAUL KRUGMAN?
>> READ BEFORE YOU AGGREGATE.
IT'S A GREAT RULE OF THE INTERNET.
>> Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO.
IT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY.
>> YOU WOULD KNOW THE HUFFINGTON POST IS NOT ABOUT RIGHT VERSUS
LEFT IT'S ABOUT RIGHT VERSUS WRONG.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Stephen: THAT'S A LOVELY BUMPER STICKER YOU HAVE THERE.
(LAUGHTER) SO WHAT IS NEXT NOW THAT YOU HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF
VIEWS A DAY, NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT LEGITIMACY?
>> WHAT'S NEXT TO ME IS TO LEARN TO COOK.
>> Stephen: YOU'RE GREEK AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THE COOK?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE GREEK AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO COOK.
IT'S LIKE BEING FRENCH AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO HAVE AFTERNOON SEX.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: WELL, ARIANNA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
CONGRATULATIONS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD LUCK.
THE ARIANNA HUFFINGTON, THE HUFFINGTON POST.
WE'LL
