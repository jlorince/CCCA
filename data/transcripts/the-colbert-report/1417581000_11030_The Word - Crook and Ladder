(LAUGHTER)NATION, A LOT OF PEOPLE -- IT'S
GONNA BE BIG -- A LOT OFPEOPLE SAY THAT AMERICA'S BEST
DAYS ARE BEHIND US. WE DON'TMAKE ANYTHING ANYMORE.
OUR CARS ARE MADE IN JAPAN, OURCOMPUTERS ARE MADE IN CHINA,
EVEN OUR SEXIEST MEN ARE MADE INAUSTRALIA.
BUT THERE'S STILL ONE THINGAMERICA PRODUCES MORE OF THAN
ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD --PRISONERS.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SIR
AMERICA HAS 2.3 MILLION PEOPLEBEHIND BARS.
WE BEAT EVERYONE!
IN YOUR FACE, CHINA!
THOUGH I DO WANT TO THANK YOUFOR PRODUCING THOSE CHEAP
PLASTIC HANDCUFFS.
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUTYOU.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO MASSINCARCERATION AMERICA-STYLE,
NOBODY DOES IT LIKE CALIFORNIA.
SINCE THE MID '70s, ITS PRISONPOPULATION HAS GROWN BY 750%,
DRIVEN BY THE STATE'S TOUGHTHREE-STRIKES LAW, WHICH
MANDATED 25 YEARS TO LIFE FORANYONE CONVICTED OF THREE
FELONIES -- EVEN FOR NON-VIOLENTOFFENSES LIKE DRUG POSSESSION OR
ATTEMPTING TO STEAL A PAIR OFWORK GLOVES FROM HOME DEPOT.
SURE, IT SEEMS PETTY, BUT ITSTARTS WITH GLOVES, NEXT HE'S
PICKING UP A CHAINSAW, A SHED TOHIDE THE BODY, AND WALL SCONCES
TO GIVE THE MURDER SCENE SOMEACCENT LIGHTING!
BUT A CALIFORNIA'S MODEL PRISONSYSTEM COULD SOON BE ON DEATH
ROW, AND THAT BRINGS US TOTONIGHT'S WORD.
(CHEERING)CROOK AND LADDER.
NATION, CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS AREUNDER ATTACK BY ACTIVIST JUDGES.
IN 2011, THE SUPREME COURT RULEDTHAT CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S
OVERCROWDED PRISONS ARE SO BADTHAT THEY VIOLATE THE BAN ON
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.
OH, BIG WHOOP.
ALL OUR PRISONS AREOVERCROWDED -- THE PHANTOM ZONE,
ARKHAM, AZKABAN.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED -- THE
COURT ORDERED CALIFORNIA TO DOSOMETHING ABOUT PRISON
OVERCROWDING, BUT SO FAR THESTATE'S RESPONSE IS NOWHERE TO
BE SEEN.
OF COURSE, THEY COULD SOLVE THEWHOLE THING IF THEY JUST STORED
INMATES IN THOSE ZIPLOC SPACEBAGS.
SO WHILE THE STATE GOVERNMENTWRESTLED WITH THE PROBLEM, LAST
MONTH CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVEDPROPOSITION 47, WHICH REDUCES
PENALTIES FOR OFFENDERS WHOCOMMIT NON-SERIOUS AND
NON-VIOLENT CRIMES, POTENTIALLYRELEASING 10,000 FELONS FROM
STATE PRISON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
10,000 NON-VIOLENT FELONS BACKON THE STREETS.
GOVERNOR BROWN IS GONNA HAVE TODEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD TO
HOME DEPOT'S GLOVE AISLE.
(LAUGHTER)FOLKS, I SAY WE MUST KEEP THESE
DANGER-ISH CRIMINALS BEHINDBARS.
AND NOT JUST TO PUNISH THEM.
>> FOR DECADES, CALIFORNIA HASUSED INMATES TO FIGHT FIRES AND
CLEAR LAND TO STOP THE SPREAD OFWILDFIRES.
PHYSICALLY FIT INMATES WITH NOHISTORY OF VIOLENT CRIMES CAN
WORK AS FIREFIGHTERS WHILESERVING THEIR SENTENCE.
>> THE RECENTLY-PASSEDINITIATIVE COULD FREE SUCH
PRISONERS FROM JAIL AND DEPLETETHE POOL OF INMATES WHO QUALIFY
FOR FIRE DUTY.
>> Stephen: THAT MEANS THENEXT TIME THERE'S A FIRE, YOU
COULD BE STUCK IN YOUR HOME ANDTHERE WON'T BE A CONVICTED FELON
RUSHING TOWARDS YOU WITH AN AXE.
(LAUGHTER)CALIFORNIA NEEDS THESE
PRISONERS.
SO WHEN FEDERAL JUDGES ORDEREDTHEIR RELEASE, THE STATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOUGHTTO KEEP THE PRISONERS WORKING IN
THEIR FIRE BRIGADE.
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THELIVES THESE PRISONERS SAVE, IT'S
ABOUT SOMETHING MUCH MOREIMPORTANT -- ALL THE MONEY.
BECAUSE CORRECTIONS OFFICIALSSAY THE FIRE PROGRAM SAVES THE
STATE MORE THAN $100 MILLION AYEAR.
BECAUSE INMATES EARN JUST $2 ADAY FIGHTING FIRES.
WITH PAY LIKE THAT, IT'S NOWONDER SMOKEY THE BEAR CAN'T
AFFORD A SHIRT.
THE SAVINGS ARE VITAL BECAUSETHE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS
ALREADY BURNED THROUGH THISYEAR'S WILDFIRE-FIGHTING
BUDGET OF $209 MILLION.
CALIFORNIA HASN'T SEEN THAT KINDOF CASH GO UP IN SMOKE SINCE THE
LAST TIME SOMEONE LET M. NIGHTSHYAMALAN MAKE A MOVIE.
NATION, I FOR ONE SALUTECALIFORNIA
PRISON AUTHORITIES FOR NOTRELEASING NON-VIOLENT PRISONERS
FROM CRUEL AND UNUSUALCONDITIONS.
AFTER YEARS OF CORPORATIONSOUTSOURCING AMERICAN JOBS,
THEY'VE FOUND A WAY TO BRINGTHIRD-WORLD WAGES BACK HOME.
IT'S LIKE HAVING OUR OWN PRIVATEBANGLADESH!
THESE ARE THE BEST WORKERSALMOST NO MONEY CAN BUY.
THEY CAN'T QUIT.
THEY NEVER GO HOME.
AND THE ONLY UNION THEY'REALLOWED TO JOIN IS THE ARYAN
BROTHERHOOD.
AND IF WE LEGALLY MUST REDUCEOVERCROWDING, WE SHOULDN'T DO IT
BY RELEASING THESE MODELEMPLOYEES.
WE SHOULD JUST BUILD NEWPRISONS.
WE CAN DO IT CHEAP FOR TOO,BECAUSE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE
THAT WORK FOR $2 A DAY!
POINT IS, EVEN THOUGH THESEPEOPLE ARE JAILED IN CRUEL AND
UNUSUAL CONDITIONS FORNON-VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE DRUG
POSSESSION, CALIFORNIA NEEDS TOKEEP THEM.
NOT THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOOKED ONPRISON LABOR.
IT CAN STOP ANYTIME IT WANTS.
AND THAT'S THE WORD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
