OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW NATION THERE WAS A
CRUCIAL REPUBLICAN DEBATE
LAST NIGHT, OF COURSE I SAY
THAT EVERY SHOW.
ODDS ARE PRETTY GOOD I'LL BE
RIGHT.
NOW PREVIOUS DEBATES WERE
HOSTED BY FOX NEWS NBC, CNN,
BLOOMBERG AND LAST NIGHT WAS
CNBC'S TURN.
I BELIEVE NEXT IT'S ANIMAL
PLANET.
(LAUGHTER)
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME
TOUGH QUESTIONS ON THE
HOUSING CRIES FRIS THOSE
MEERKATS.
-- OF COURSE THIS DEBATE
WILL BE FOREVER REMEMBERED
FOR ONE THING AND ONE THING
ONLY, AND RICK PERRY CAN'T
REMEMBER WHAT IT IS.
(LAUGHTER)
JIM?
>> AND I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S
THREE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT
WHEN I GET THERE THAT ARE
GONE.
COMMERCE, EDUCATION AND, THE,
UH, WHAT'S THE THIRD ONE
THERE, LET'S SEE.
>> YOU MEAN FIVE.
>> OH, FIVE, COMMERCE,
EDUCATION, AND, THE,-- UH,
UH.
>> EPA.
>> EPA, THERE YOU GO.
>> LET'S TALK DEFICIT
REDUCTION.
>> SERIOUSLY?
IS EPA THE ONE YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT.
>> NO, SIR, NO, SIR.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE-- AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT,
EPA NEEDS TO BE REBUILT,
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
>> YOU CAN'T NAME THE THIRD
ONE THE THIRD AGENCY OF
GOVERNMENT I WOULD DO AWAY
WITH, EDUCATION, THE, UH-- I
I-- COMMERCE, AND LET'S
SEE-- I CAN'T, THE THIRD ONE,
I CAN'T, SORRY.
OOPS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: NOW I WAS
WORRIED THERE UNTIL HE STUCK
THE LANDING WITH SORRY OOPS.
NOW PERRY SHOULD HAVE JUST
COVERED THE WAY DO WHEN YOU
FORGET SOMEONE'S NAME AT THE
PARTY.
THE THREE DEPARTMENTS I WANT
TO ELIMINATE ARE COMMERCE,
EDUCATION, AND, UH, CHIEF
BIG GUY OVER HERE.
OR INTRODUCE YOUR WIFE TO
THE DEPARTMENT AND HOPE IT
SAYS ITS NAME TO HER.
NOW FOLKS--
(APPLAUSE)
>> I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
HAS COMPASSION FOR THIS MAN.
>> WE ALL HAVE SYMPATHY FOR
SOMEONE FORGETTING
SOMETHING.
>> IT WAS A TOUGH MOMENT.
I THINK ALL OF US RECOGNIZE
THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING NONE
OF US WOULD WANT TO GO
THROUGH AND IT WAS VERY
DIFFICULT.
AND WE ALL FELT VERY BAD FOR
HIM.
>> WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
FORGOTTEN SOMETHING ON A
HIGH PROFILE LEVEL.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.
>> IT'S A VERY HUMAN THING.
>> THE MINUTE THAT HAPPENED,
NOTHING BUT EMPATHY.
>> I THINK HE LOOKED HUMAN.
>> Stephen: BROWN HAIRED GUY
WHO IS NOT STEVE DUCEY IS
RIGHT.
IT MADE PERRY LOOK HUMAN.
THAT'S SOMETHING MITT ROMNEY
WOULD DIE FOR.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
POWER DOWN AND RESTART.
BUT WITH THIS HUMANIZING
MOMENT, PERRY SHOWED HE'S
NOT JUST THE KIND OF GUY YOU
WANT TO HAVE A BEER W HE'S
THE KIND OF GUY WHO GOT A
HEAD START ON THE BEER
BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP.
I SAY, FOLK OS, HE'S GOT TO
DO MORE OF THIS.
THE 14 MORE DEBATES.
AND THE NEXT ONE I THINK
PERRY SHOULD CALL ALL OF HIS
O UPON ENTS ROSCOE, GET HIS
BALLS CAUGHT IN HIS ZIPPER
AND THEN STRIDE OFF STAGE
LIKE LATIN POP STAR JUAN
GABRIELE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: I PROMISE, I
PROMISE, YOU KEEP THE FLUBS
COMING, GOVERNOR PERRY AND
WILL YOU BE OUR NEXT
COMMANDER IN CHIEF WITH YOUR
FINGER ON THE-- OH, COME ON,
IT'S UH, IT'S BIG, IT'S RED,
YOU PUSH IT, EVERYONE DIES.
UH-- SORRY.
