THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGUS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WHAT AN EVENING.
NOW, FOLKS... FOLKS, I GOT TOTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S BEEN A GREAT SHOW SO FAR,BUT BEFORE WE GO, I WANT TO
UPDATE YOU ON MY ONGOING WARWITH AMAZON.
LAST WEEK I BROKE THE STORY OFSOMETHING ABOUT ME.
YOU SEE, AMAZON IS IN HEATEDCONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH MY
PUBLISHER HACHETTE. AND ASLEVERAGE, AMAZON IS PREVENTING
PREORDERS AND
DELAYING SHIPMENT OFHACHETTE'S MOST POPULAR AUTHORS
INCLUDING ME.[AUDIENCE BOOING]
OH, DON'T MAKE ME UNLEASH THESEDOGS.
FOLKS, THIS ISTERRIBLE.
I AM ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS.
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME.
BECAUSE OF AMAZON'SSCORCHED-EARTH TACTICS, MORE
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCREWED THANIN "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY."
SO I TOLD AMAZON C.E.O. JEFFBEZOS, IT'S GO TIME, LEX LOSER.
BEFORE I KNEW IT, MY COURAGEOUSSTAND CREATED A FIRESTORM ALL
OVER THE INTERNET, AND UNLIKERIHANNA, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO
SHOW SIDE-BOOB.
I EVEN OFFERED.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOWTHIS BUT I'M GREAT GUY.
SO I DID THIS NOT JUST FOR ME,BUT FOR THE FIRST-TIME NOVELISTS
LIKE EDAN LEPUCKI, WHOSEHACHETTE BOOK "CALIFORNIA" COULD
NOT BE PRE-ORDERED ON AMAZON, ADEATH SENTENCE FOR A NEW BOOK.
SO I ASKED DO YOU GO TOCOLBERTNATION.COM AND PREORDER
"CALIFORNIA" FROM POWELL'SBOOKS.
NATION, YOU PREORDERED JUST AS IPREORDERED YOU DO.
AS OF TODAY YOU HEROS HAVEBOUGHT OVER 6,400 COPIES OF
CALIFORNIA.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]IN FACT, YOU HAVE MADE
CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER-ONE BOOKON POWELL'S FOR WEEKS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD REALLY SHOW AMAZON THAT WEWILL NOT LICK THEIR MONOPOLY
BOOT, OR ANY OF THEIR MONOPOLYPIECES?
IF WE PUT "CALIFORNIA" ON "THENEW YORK TIMES" BESTSELLER LIST.
WE ARE CLOSE.
NATION, I WANT YOU TO GO TOCOLBERTNATION.COM AND PREORDER
THIS BOOK LIKE AMAZON DOESN'TWANT YOU TO.
OR PREORDER IT FROM OTHER PLACESLIKE PARNASSUS BOOKS, POLITICS
AND PROSE, RAINY DAY OR GO TOYOUR LOCAL BOOKSTORE, WALK UP TO
THE COUNTER AND JUST CLICK ONTHE CLERK.
OKAY.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED THAT.
AND TELL THEM, "I WANT TOPREORDER "CALIFORNIA" BY EDAN
LEPUCKI."
ACT NOW AND IT WILL HAPPEN EVENSOONER.
GOOD NIGHT.
