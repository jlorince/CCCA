EVERYBODY.
FOLKS, I HAD YESTERDAY OFF, AND
I SPENT A BIG PART OF MY LONG
WEEKEND POUNDING BUD LIGHT LIMES
IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE CEVEICI
OUT OF MY LIVER
THE REST OF THE TIME I SAT BACK
AND ADMIRED THE OMEGA BALLS ON
MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK.
TONIGHT I RECOGNIZE JETBLUE
FLIGHT ATTENTION DAPTD STEVEN
SLATER.
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT DUE TO
CUTBACKS AIR TRAVEL HAS BECOME A
TRIP UP THE DEVIL'S BUTT HOLE IN
A FLYING ALUMINUM SUPPOSETORY.
EVERY ONE OF THESE AIRBORNE RAGE
TUBES CON TEARS A HERD OF
CRAMPED, DEFEATED PEOPLE, EACH
ON THE VERGE OF TOTAL FERAL
MELTDOWN, BUT AS BAD AS IT IS
FOR THE PASSENGERS, IT'S EVEN
TOUGHER ON FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.
IN SLATER'S CASE, HE WOULD
WORKING A FLIGHT FROM PITTSBURGH
TO NEW YORK WHICH STARTED WITH
AN ALTERCATION BETWEEN TWO
PASSENGERS OVER SPACE IN THE
OVERHEAD BIN.
WHEN SLATER STEPPED IN, HE GOT
HIT IN THE HEAD WITH ONE OF THE
BAG, AN I'M SURE HIS BONES ARE
VERY WEAK GIVEN HIS ALL
MINIPRETZEL DIET.
WHEN THE FLIGHT LANDED, ONE OF
THE PASSENGERS BECAME SO ENRAGED
THAT THE BAG SHE GATE CHECKED
WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE,
SHE CURSED SLATEDDER OUT.
SLATER ASKED FOR AN APOLOGY.
THE PASSENGER SAID, GO [BLEEPED]
YOURSELF, THEN CALLED HIM A
MOTHER [BLEEPED].
CLEARLY THIS WOMAN HAS NEVER
SEEN SAMUEL L. JACKSON'S
INSTRUCTION VIDEO ON POPPER
IN-FLIGHT SWEARING.
>> I HAVE HAD IT WITH THESE
MONKEY BITING SNAKES ON THIS
MONDAY TO FRIDAY PLANE.
>> Stephen: NOW, A BETA DOG
MIGHT REMAIN CALM, BUT SLATER
BIT BACK THE WAY EVERY FLIGHT
ATTENDANT SECRETLY WISHES THEY
COULD.
HE GOT ON THE P.A. AND SAID, TO
THE PASSENGER WHO CALLED ME A
MOTHER [BLEEPED], [BLEEPED] YOU.
THEN CLOSED WITH, THAT'S IT, I'M
DONE, GRABBED SOME BEER FROM THE
GALLEY, PULLED THE EMERGENCY
HANDLE AND JUMPED DOWN THE
EVACUATION SLIDE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I ASSUME... I ASSUME RIDING HIS
BALLS SLIEK -- LIKE A SLED.
THANKS TO SLATER, WE'LL NEED TO
MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE AIRLINE
SAFETY CARD, LIKE IN THE EVENT
OF FLIGHT ATTENDANT FREAKOUT,
ASSUME CRASH POSITION AND EXTEND
ARM TO CAPTURE MELTDOWN ON
IPHONE.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, NO VIDEO OF
THIS?
BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT ELEVATED
SLATER TO THE FALL KENNEL.
NO.
IT'S WHEN 50 COPS SWARMED HIS
HOME LESS THAN TWO HOURS LATER.
THEY FOUND HIM IN THE MIDST OF
HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, THIS ALPHA DOG JUST NEEDED
TO RELIEVE HIS JETBLUE BALLS.
WELL, NOW WE KNOW IT'S TRUE.
JETBLUE REALLY DOES HAVE THE
BEST IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT.
SULLY SULLENBERGER, THE BAR HAS
BEEN RAISED.
AND MR. SLATER, FOR REFUSING TO
SAFELY STOW YOUR SACK BENEATH
THE SEAT IN FRONT OF YOU AND
RAISING YOUR MIDDLE FINGER TO
THE UPRIGHT AND LOCKED POSITI
