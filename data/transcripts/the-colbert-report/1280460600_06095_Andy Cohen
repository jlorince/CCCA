EVERYBODY.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EXECUTIVE
AND HOST AT BRAVO TV, SO TO MY
GAY FEMALE AND GAY FEMALE
VIEWERS, YOU'RE WELCOME.
PLEASE WELCOME WITH ME ANDY
COHEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, ANDY, GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> Stephen: NOW, SIR, YOU ARE
SENIOR V.P. OF ORIGINAL
PROGRAMING AND DEVELOPMENT AT
BRAVO.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: AND YOU HOST YOUR
OWN BRAVO TV SHOW.
>> YES.
>> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO
SLEEP WITH YOURSELF TO GET THAT
JOB?
AND WHAT IS HE LIKE IN THE SACK?
>> FANTASTIC.
>> Stephen: I THINK THAT'S
PRETTY CRAZY, UH-HUH.
>> I WISH THAT SOMEONE HAD
OFFERED TO SLEEP WITH ME TO GET
ME ON TV, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED.
>> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH ANYBODY TO GET ON THIS
SHOW?
>> I DIDN'T.
>> Stephen: MOST OF MY GUESTS
DO.
I'M SORRY.
WOULD YOU LIKE A COCKTAIL?
>> YES, THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
AT HOME.
I DRINK COCKTAILS ON MY SHOW.
I'LL HAVE VODKA AND SODA.
>> Stephen: GO CRAZY.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
GORGEOUS.
STIPE --
>> Stephen:
>> EXCELLENT.
GREAT, GREAT.
>> Stephen: I'M A TRIPLESEC
MAN.
NOW YOU DRINK A LOT ON THE SHOW.
>> I DO.
>> Stephen: IS THAT TO DULL
YOUR FEELINGS BEFORE YOU HAVE TO
WATCH "THE REAL HOUSEWIVES."
>> NO, I LOVE WATCHING THE REAL
HOUSEWIVES.
>> Stephen: WHY DO THE REAL
HOUSEWIVES ALLOW US TO WATCH
THEM.
THEY ALL LIVE IN PRIVATE GATED
COMMUNITIES.
THEY'RE UPPER CRUSTY, AND YET
THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING ON CAMERA.
>> IT'S AN INTERESTING
JUXTAPOSITION BETWEEN LIVING
BEHIND A BIG GATE AND THEN
SAYING, HEY, WHAT'S UP, HERE I
AM.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY LIVE
LARGE, THEY'RE REALLY FUN.
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THEY'RE VERY ADDICTIVE.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S
LICENSE TO GOSSIP WITH NO
CONSEQUENCES.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NO CONSEQUENCES?
YOU DON'T THINK YOUR SHOWS ARE
DESTROYING OUR NATION?
>> I DON'T, NO.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A CORRUPTING INFLUENCE AT
ALL?
>> NO, THEY'RE ADDING TO THE
FIBER.
THEY'RE BRINGING PEOPLE
TOGETHER.
THE FIBER?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: YOU GOT A NEW ONE
COMING.
>> REAL HOUSEWIVES OF D.C.
>> Stephen: FOR THE RECORD,
THERE'S ALREADY A SHOW ABOUT
BITCHNESS IN WASHINGTON.
IT'S CALLED C-SPAN.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: CHEERS.
I CAN REALLY TASTE THE
TRIPLESEC.
>> I CAN'T.
>> Stephen: NOW, THE WHITE
HOUSE PARTY CRASHERS, THE
SALAHIS, THEY ARE ON THIS SHOW,
AND THAT WERE ON THE SHOW WHEN
THEY CRASHED THE PARTY, RIGHT?
YES OR, NO SENATOR?
WERE THEY ON THE SHOW?
>> WE WERE SHOOTING WITH THEM,
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS.
>> Steve: WHAT DID BRAVO KNOW
AND WHEN DID IT KNOW IT?
>> BRAU SHOW HAD BEEN SHOOTING
WITH THEM SINCE SEPTEMBER.
WE HAD BEEN SHOOTING WITH THEM
FOR MONTHS.
AND THEY TOLD OUR PRODUCTION
CREW, HEY, WE'RE INVITED TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
WE WATCHED THEM PREPARE TO GO TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED ACHTD
WARDS IS THAT THIS EVENT IS KIND
OF REFLECTED THROUGH HOW THE
OTHER HOUSEWIVES REACT TO IT.
>> Stephen: THE HOUSEWIVES
FOUND OUT WHEN...
>> WHEN EVERYBODY DID.
>> Stephen: WHEN THE FIBER HIT
THE FAN.
AS DID BRAVO.
OH, MY GOD, DID THE CLAWS COME
OUT?
>> YES.
IT'S A SMALL PART OF THE
HOUSEWIVES OF D.C., BUT IT'S
VERY COMPELLING, AND IT'S
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE OTHER
HOUSEWIVES REACT TO WHAT
ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED THAT NIGHT AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Stephen: SO TALK ABOUT
HOUSEWIVES REACTING.
I LEGALLY CANNOT SHOW ANY OF
YOUR SHOW ON MY SHOW.
THE TWO UNIVERSES WOULD EXPLODE.
BUT WE HAVE HERE AN ACTUAL
TRANSCRIPT OF AN EXCHANGE
BETWEEN BETHANY AND KELLY.
>> YES.
THIS IS FROM SEASON TWO I
BELIEVE.
>> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME.
WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?
>> I WILL BE BETHANY.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
[IN EFFEMINATE VOICE]
>> HI.
HOW ARE YOU?
THANKS FOR WALL STREETING ME.
>> I'VE BEEN WAITING HALF AN
HOUR.
>> TOO BAD.
I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING
PERFECTLY CLEAR SO WE'RE ON THE
SAME PAGE.
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.
>> CORRECT.
>> SO YOUR ATTITUDE IS FOR KIDS.
YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME, YOU
COME UP TO ME.
I DON'T GO DOWN TO YOU.
>> EXCUSE ME?
I DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOU
WANT ME TO DO.
>> HONESTLY, BETHANY.
>> I DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOU
WANT ME TO DO.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, HONESTLY.
>> I AM WAITING TO HEAR WHAT YOU
INVITED ME HERE TO SAY.
>> I WILL NOT INDULGE YOU IN
THIS, OKAY.
WE DON'T COME, WE'RE NOT THE
SAME, OKAY.
THIS IS YOU.
THIS IS ME.
WE DON'T TALK.
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE WHY?
>> BECAUSE I DON'T PUT UP WITH
YOUR ANTICS AND YOUR BULL
[BLEEPED].
IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND I
KNOW YOU THINK IT'S REALLY CUTE
AND FUN, BUT YOU EMBARRASS
YOURSELF.
YOU REALLY DO.
I FELT SO BADLY FOR YOU, LIKE
THAT POOR GIRL.
>> YOU FELT BADLY, YOU FELT
BADLY FOR ME?
>> UH-HUH.
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AN
ARTHRITIS CHARITY AND YOU SAID,
OH, THAT'S SO CUTE.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND
ME IS THAT WHILE YOU'RE BUSY
TALKING, I'M BUSY DOING THINGS,
SO YOU NEED TO REALIZE THE
SITUATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: ANDY COH
