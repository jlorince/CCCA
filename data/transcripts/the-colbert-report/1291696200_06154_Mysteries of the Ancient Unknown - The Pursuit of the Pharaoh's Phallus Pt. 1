>> Stephen: WELCOME BAN,
EVERYBODY.
NATION, IT IS DECEMBER.
WHEN NEWS ORGANIZATIONS RELEASE
THEIR LIST OF THE BIGGEST
STORIES OF 2010.
FOR ME, ONE STORY WAS BIGGER
THAN THE ECONOMY, THE B.P. OIL
SPILL AND WIKILEAKS PUT
TOGETHER.
AND NO SURPRISE I WAS THE ONLY
ONE WITH THE COURAGE TO COVER
IT.
SO TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO
PROCLAIM 2010 THE YEAR OF KING
TUT'S MISSING PENIS.
IT'S TIME FOR THE THIRD
INSTALLMENT OF MY
PEABODY-DEFYING SERIES, "STEPHEN
COLBERT PRESENTS MYSTERIES OF
THE ANCIENT UNKNOWN: KING TUT'S
PENIS."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, FOLKS, I SHOULD EXPLAIN,
THE PENIS IS THE MALE SEXUAL
ORGAN.
PERHAPS I SHOULD EXPLAIN
FURTHER.
WHEN KING TUT'S MUMMY WAS
DISCOVERED IN 1922, THE KING'S
TUT WAS THERE.
BUT IN 1968 WHEN THEY
RE-EXAMINED THE BOY-KING, THE
BOY'S THING WAS GONE.
♪♪
REALLY.
OKAY.
AS A JOURNALIST, I REFUSED TO
STAND BY WHILE SOMEONE MAKES OFF
WITH THE KING TUT SUN DRIED SCH
SCHWANTZ.
SO WHEN I LEARNED THAT KING
TUT'S TREASURES WERE COMING TO
NEW YORK, I HEADED OVER TO SOLVE
MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT
UNKNOWN, STEPHEN COLBERT AND THE
PURSUIT OF THE PHARAOH'S
PHALACE.
I WOULD TRAVEL ANY DISTANCE, AS
LONG AS IT WASN'T MORE THAN 12
BLOCKS.
MY QUEST WOULD LEAD ME TO THE
KING TUT EXHIBIT IN TIMES SQUARE
TO LEARN ME ABOUT THE PHARAOH
FROM DR. DAVID SILVERMAN.
DR. SILVERMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Stephen: TO HELP ME UNCOVER
THE MYSTERY OF KING TUT'S PENIS.

( LAUGHTER )
WHO IS KING TUT?
>> KING TUT WAS THRUST INTO A
VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION AND
BECAME KING AT NINE YEARS OLD.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A LONG
TIME AGO, RIGHT?
PREWORLD WAR I?
>> OH, YEAH, IT WAS PREWORLD WAR
I.
>> Stephen: PILGRIMS.
>> YEAH, 3,300 YEARS AGO.
>> Stephen: SO LIKE
"MAYFLOWER."
>> EVEN BEYOND THAT.
>> Stephen: I DON'T THINK
AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED BEFORE
THAT.
I THINK BEFORE THAT IT WAS JUST
INDIANS.
>> WELL IN OTHER PARTS OF THE
WORLD THERE WERE THINGS GOING
ON.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT THIS IN
TERMS THAT AMERICANS CAN
UNDERSTAND.
>> WHERE IN AMERICAN HISTORY WAS
THIS HAPPENING?
>> THERE WAS NO AMERICAN
HISTORY.
>> Stephen: ARE WE TALKING ELI
WHITNEY COTTON GIN?
JUST GIVE ME AN HISTORICAL
CONTEXT.
>> THINK ABOUT BEN FRANKLIN
LIVING 3,300 YEARS AGO AND
THAT'S THE WAY IT WOULD WORK.
>> Stephen: SO BEN FRANKLIN?
>> YES.
>> Stephen: I HAVE TO ASK THIS
BECAUSE TUT WAS EGYPTIAN.
WAS HE A MUSLIM?
>> NO, THIS SEE EVEN BEFORE
MUSLIMS EXISTED, TOO.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT WERE THEY
CALLED THEM, ISLAMIC?
>> NO, THEY WERE CALLED
EGYPTIANS.
>> Stephen: ISN'T A PYRAMID
JUST A SAND MOSQUE?
>> NO.
IT'S MADE OUT OF STONE.
>> Stephen: OKAY, SO A STONE
MOSQUE.
>> NO.
>> Stephen: WHY DID THE
EGYPTIANS HATE US FOR OUR
FREEDOMS?
>> WELL, THE AND ANCIENT ONES
COULDN'T HAVE HATED US BECAUSE
WE DIDN'T EXIST.
>> BEN FRANKLIN DID, THOUGH.
YOUR WORDS.
YOUR WORDS, SIR.
DOCTOR, STOP BEATING AROUND THE
BUSH.
WHERE IS THE PENIS?
>> NOW IT'S PROBABLY WHERE IT
WAS MEANT TO BE, AND THAT IS IN
THE TOMB OF KING TUT.
>> Stephen: IT'S MEANT TO BE
ATTACHED TO KING TUT.
I KNOW THAT'S A RADICAL CONCEPT,
BUT IT SHOULD BE RIGHT BETWEEN
HIS LEGS AND IT'S NOT.
>> WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE MYSTERY.
1922, TUT IS DISCOVERED IN HIS
TOMB BY HOWARD CARTER.
PENIS IS INTACT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Stephen: MINUSCULE BUT
INTACT.
>> WELL, IT IS MUMMIFIED.
>> Stephen: THAT'S A
CONVENIENT EXCUSE.
1968, BOOM, NOTICE ANYTHING
MISSING?
>> WELL, IT WAS MOVED FROM ONE
CASE TO ANOTHER CASE, AND THE
PENIS PROBABLY FELL OFF IN THE
SAND AND THEN...
>> Stephen: DON'T YOU THINK
ANYONE WOULD HAVE NOTICED?
>> YOU WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO,
BUT APPARENTLY THAT WASN'T SO.
>> Stephen: I WOULD DEFINITELY
HAVE.
YOU CHECKED THE TOMB FOR
FINGERPRINTS?
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.
>> Stephen: I HOPE NO ONE HAS
DISTURBED IT, HAVE THEY?
NO ONE HAS TAKEN ANYTHING OUT OF
THE TOMB IN THE LAST 3,000
YEARS.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE.
>> Stephen: THE CRIME SCENE IS
RUINED.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
C.S.I. MIAMI?
>> IN ANCIENT TIMES THEY WEREN'T
AWARE OF FINGERPRINTS.
>> Stephen: THERE COULD BE
CLUES IN THE TOMB THAT COULD
LEAD US TO KING TUT'S PENIS.
SHALL WE GO TAKE A LOOK?
>> SURE.
>> Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.
WE BRAVED THE DANGERIOUS JOURNEY
DOWNSTAIRS TO SEARCH FOR CLUES
AMONG THE OBJECTS IN THE KING
TUT EXHIBIT.
SO HERE WE ARE IN KING TUT'S
TOMB.
>> WELL, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY KING
TUT'S TOMB.
>> Stephen: OKAY, WELL, THEN,
AT LEAST HIS MUMMY IS IN THIS
SARCOPHAGUS, SO ITSELF LET'S
CRACK THIS THING OPEN, TAKE A
LOOK INSIDE AND FISH AROUND FOR
THAT PENIS.
>> WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY NOT KING
TUT'S SARCOPHAGUS EITHER.
>> Stephen: SO IT'S NOT TUT?
>> NO.
>> Stephen: OH, DOCTOR, I HAVE
MADE A REMARKABLE DISCOVERY.
I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS.
( LAUGHTER )
I CARED ABOUT ONLY ONE THING,
GETTING MY HANDS ON THAT PENIS.
TUNE IN TOMORROW FOR THE
SHOCKING CONCLUSION OF
"MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT
UNKNOWN: STEPHEN COLBERT AND THE
PURSUIT OF THE PENIS."
TUNE IN TOMORROW FOR THE SECOND
HALF OF MY REPORT ON KING TUT'S
PENIS.
IT'S EVEN MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN
THE||||
