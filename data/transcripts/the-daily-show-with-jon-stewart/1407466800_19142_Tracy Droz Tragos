THE FAMILIES THAT WERESTRUGGLING THERE IN THE HOUSES
WITH THE TARPS FOR ROOFS AND,YOU KNOW, THE BROKEN WINDOWS
AND...
>> Jon: AND THIS IS A TOWNTHAT'S BEEN STRUGGLING SINCE
REALLY WORLD WAR II,SINCE THE COLD WAR.
>> YEAH IT WAS RICH HILL FORCOAL.
>> Jon: YEAH.>> AND THEN THE COAL WENT DRY.
AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLEINDUSTRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> SO...
>> Jon: TOUGH. BUT IT GIVES ALOOK INTO A POVERTY THAT PEOPLE
DON'T THINK ABOUT AS MUCH.
>> YEAH, YEAH, OR DON'T THINKABOUT IN A CERTAIN KIND OF WAY.
I MEAN, WE REALLY WANTED TO TELLAN INTIMATE, EMOTIONAL, UP-CLOSE
STORY. WE DIDN'T,YOU KNOW, WE WANTED
TO TELL THE HUMAN STORY BEHINDTHE STATISTICS, AND
SOMETIMES THESE FAMILIES GET,YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT SEE THEM
IN LIKE "HONEY BOO BOO" OR "DUCKDYNASTY."
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT, IT'S KIND OF MORE OF AREALITY TV IN AND OUT.
>> Jon: YES. THIS IS NOCARICATURE OF ANYTHING.
>> NO. WE REALLYGAVE THESE KIDS AND
THEIR FAMILIES KIND OFAUTHORSHIP...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND KIND OF GOT OUT OF
THE WAY AND LET THEM TELL THEIRSTORY.

FOR THREE TEENAGE BOYS, ONES WHOALSO HAVE... I MEAN, THERE
ARE SOME VERY DIFFICULT THINGSTHAT THEY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND THEY ARE WILDLYAVAILABLE FOR THAT.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE TRUST WASKIND OF AMAZING.
AND THEY TRUSTED US.
I HOPE WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TOVIOLATE THAT TRUST IN THE END,
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WASBECAUSE MY GRANDPARENTS WERE
WELL-KNOWN IN TOWN...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A THIRDGRADE SCHOOL TEACH THAT
EVERYBODY LOVED, SO THAT WASKIND OF A GOOD CREDENTIAL FOR
US.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IDON'T, I THINK ULTIMATELY THERE
WAS A FEELING OF THEM WANTINGTO TELL THEIR STORY AND
WANTING TO BE HEARD...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEY WERE INTERESTED THATANYBODY CARED AT ALL, YOU KNOW,
THAT ANYBODY WAS KNOCKING ONTHEIR DOOR.
>> Jon: RIGHT. YEAH,I THOUGHT, I MEAN,
FOR YOU TO PUT A HUMANFACE ON THIS WAS REALLY VERY
UPSETTING TO ME.
I REALLY PREFER NOT TO THINKABOUT IT.
[LAUGHTER]SO, DAMN YOU DROZ TRAGOS.
IT'S, YOU KNOW, WHAT'SINTERESTING TO ME, SO WE HAVE
THIS IMAGE. YOU KNOW, THERE IS ACERTAIN POPULATION IN
THIS COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES THATPOVERTY IS LACK OF VIRTUE.
>> YEAH. >> Jon: AND HERE YOU
HAVE JUST LAID OUT THE HUMANITYOF THESE KIDS GOING
THROUGH THEIR STRUGGLES, THEDIFFICULTY THEY HAVE IN CLAIMING
THEIR VIRTUE AND IN JUST TRYINGTO GET BY, AND YOU CANNOT HELP
BUT THINK WE ARE SADDLING AGENERATION WITH JUST BAGGAGE
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, YOU'D HAVE TOBE SISYPHUS TO GET OUT OF THAT.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I WASSO IMPRESSED WITH THE RESILIENCE
OF THESE KIDS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ANDREW, ONEOF THE BOYS, HE'S SO
FRICKEN OPTIMISTIC.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YET HE HAS SO MANYCHALLENGES. AND, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOINGTO REALIZE HIS DREAMS.
I REALLY HOPE SO, I REALLYBELIEVE IN THIS KID.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HISHARD WORK IS SIMPLY NOT GOING
TO BE ENOUGH. HE HAS SO MANYCHALLENGES IN HIS LIFE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.

KIND OF SHIFT THE CONVERSATIONAROUND, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, THAT
IT'S JUST FOLKS ARE LAZYOR IT'S THEIR CHOICE...

WITH THAT DECISION.

SEE LIKE, SOMEBODY BUYSINTO THIS KID, SOMEBODY
GIVES A LITTLE BITOF ATTENTION, LIKE THAT'S GOING
TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE.

>> YEAH.>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT
IS INTERESTING TOO IS THAT,YOU KNOW, WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO
THERE'S URBAN POVERTY ANDRURAL POVERTY AND SOMEHOW
THEY ARE THIS DISTINCTFUNCTION. BUT THEY'RE NOT.
BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF SERVICESFOR THE MORE RURAL KIDS STRUCK
ME, THAT IT'S DIFFICULTTO GAIN SERVICES.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THERE'S ADISTINCT STING TO RURAL POVERTY,
WHICH IS YOUR ISOLATION.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YOU KNOW, YOUR CAR BREAKSDOWN, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY FOR GAS, YOU'REREALLY STUCK.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> AND YOU KNOW, IN
RICH HILL THEY'RE JUST NOWGETTING, YOU KNOW, 911.
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT EVEN THOSEKINDS OF SERVICES.
IT WOULD BE A VOLUNTEER FIREDEPARTMENT THAT WOULD RESPOND TO
CALLING THEM DIRECTLY.
