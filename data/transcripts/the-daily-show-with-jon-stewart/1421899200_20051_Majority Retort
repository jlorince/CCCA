SO ON RAINY SCHOOL DAYS, MYMOM WOULD SLIP PLASTIC BREAD
BAGS OVER THEM, BUT I WASNEVER EMBARRASSED.
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL BUS WOULDBE FILLED WITH ROWS AND ROWS
OF YOUNG IOWANS WITH BREADBAGS SLIPPED OVER THEIR FEET.
OF YOUNG IOWANS WITH BREADBAGS SLIPPED OVER THEIR FEET.
>> Jon: IS THAT YOU, SIRI?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW, THAT
SEEMED LIKE LESS OF ARESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S
ADDRESS THAN AN APPLICATIONESSAY TO NOSTALGIA
UNIVERSITY.
NOSTALGIA UNIVERSITY, IT WASBETTER WHEN YOUR DAD WENT
THERE.
WHAT IS ERNST TRYING TOACCOMPLISH BY TELLING US
HER ORIGIN STORY?
>> HER JOB WAS TO HUMANIZETHE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
