MY GUEST TONIGHT, UNITES STATESSENATOR OF THE GREAT STATE
OF NEW YORK, PLEASE WELCOMEBACK TO THE PROGRAM SENATOR
KRISTEN GILLIBRAND, COME ON OUTHERE!
>> Jon: SENATOR, WELCOME ONCEAGAIN TO THE PROGRAM.
>> THANKS.
>> Jon: YOU WANT TO RUNFOR PRESIDENT?
>> NO.
>> Jon: I THINK YOU MAYHAVE TO.
ISN'T THAT A THING,IA-- WHATIS IN THE WATER DOWN THERE,
WHAT IS IN THE CAFETERIATHAT THESE GUYS ALL THINK,
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO BEPRESIDENT.
WHEN NOT THEIR HOME STATES,THEY'RE DISPISED.
THESE GUYS ARE NOT EVENSUCCESS ENVELOPE THEIR HOME
STATES AND THEY HATE ME HERE,YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WOULDN'T
HATE ME, EVERYWHERE ELSE.
>> I WORK WELL WITH MANY OFTHEM.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I HOPE MANY OF THEM ARESTILL SERVING IN THE U.S.
SENATE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE THE BEST.
SO-- SO THEY'RE NOTUNBOUNDED FROM REALITY OR
DELUDEED NARCISSISTIC EGOMANIACS WHO HAVE NO BUSINESS
NOT ONLY LEGISLATING THISCOUNTRY, BUT BEING ALLOWED TO
THE OUTSIDE WEARING PANTS.
>> WELL, MY JOB IS TO FINDCOMMON GROUND WITH THEM AND
GET THINGS DONE.
>> Jon: NOW YOU BRING UP ANEXCELLENT POINT.
HOW DO YOU FIND COMMONGROUND?
(LAUGHTER)
WITH THEM.
>> WELL, SOMETIMES THERE AREISSUES OF CONSCIENCE LIKE
THE 9/11 HEALTH BILL WHEREYOU HAVE TO STAND UP AND DO
THE RIGHT THING.
SOMETIMES IT'S ISSUES LIKEENDING RAPE ON COLLEGE
CAMPUSES OR MILITARY.
>> Jon: THIS IS A PERFECTEXAMPLE.
ENDING RAPE IN THE MILITARYAND THE 9/11 FIRST
RESPONDERS.
THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TOFIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIND
COMMON GROUND-- LET'S TALKABOUT THE 9/11.
BECAUSE THAT ONE MAKES ME SOMAD I CAN'T EVEN THINK
STRAIGHT.
SO WHEN IS THAT EXPIRING,OCTOBER?
>> YES.
AND SO IT JUST IS ONE OF THEPOLICE OFFICERS SAID IN A
HEARING, DAVID SAID IF WEDON'T PASS THIS, PEOPLE WILL
DIE.
>> Jon: PEOPLE HAVE ALREADYDIED AND THEY DIDN'T PASS
IT.
>> YEAH, YEAH, SINCE 9/11,1700 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND WE
HAVE NEARLY 4,000 WITHHORRIBLE, HORRIBLE CANCERS.
>> Jon: MORE FIRST RESPONDERSHAVE DIED SINCE 9/11 FROM
BEING ON THE PILE, FROMTHOSE DISEASES THAN 9/11.
>> MORE COPS HAVE DIED SINCE9/11 THAN ON 9/11 ITSELF.
>> Jon: INSANE.
SO WHAT IS THE RESISTANCE?
WALK ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS,BECAUSE THAT IS THE THING I
HAVE TROUBLE FIGURING OUT.
WHAT IS THE RESISTANCEWITH JUST EXTENDING THIS
BILL IN PERPETUITY LIKE THEYDID WITH THE MINORS WITH
BLACK LUNGS, LIKE THEY HAVEDONE WITH PEOPLE EXPOSED TO
RADIATION IN NUCLEAR TESTS,WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
BE A SENATOR THAT IS PUSHINGBACK ON THIS.
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY?
>> WELL, IF YOU ASKED THE9/11 RESPONDER, SOME WHO ARE
HERE RIGHT WITH US HERE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THEY'RE HERE, LOVE THEM.
>> BLESS THEM FOR THEIRCOURAGE.
SO WHEN THEY WALK THE HALLSOF CONGRESS, WHICH BY THE
WAY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.
THIS IS SOMETHING MEMBERS OFCONGRESS SHOULD BE DOING FOR
THEM, THEY ANSWER THE CALLOF DUTY, BUT WHEN THEY GO
INTO THESE OFFICES, THEFIRST THING OUT OF OUR
MEMBERS' MOUTHS ARE "HOW AREYOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT?"
WHY WOULD YOU BE ASKING MENAND WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THE
CALL OF DUTY HOW THEY AREGOING TO PAY FOR THEIR
HEALTH CARE.
IT'S OUTRAGE US.
WHEREAS THEY WILL GIVE A TAXCREDIT TO ANY CORPORATE
ENTITY AND NOT PAY FOR ITBECAUSE THEY WANT TO, BUT
THEY ASK THESE MEN AND WOMEN,WHO MANY GAVE THEIR LIVES,
MANY ARE STILL GIVING THEIRLIVES, BECAUSE THEY ANSWER
THE CALL OF DUTY.
>> Jon: OUTRAGEOUS ON MANYLEVELS.
A, WHEN ARE YOU DEALING WITHILLNESS, WHETHER IT BE A
CANCER OR RESPIRATORY OREVEN PTSD, THE LAST THING
YOU NEED TO BE DOING ISHAVING TO PLOP DOWN TO
WASHINGTON TO ADVOCATE, SOWE'RE FORCING THEM TO BE IN
A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVETO BE THEIR OWN BEST
ADVOCATES TO THE PEOPLE OFTHE GOVERNMENT WHO SHOULD BE
THE ONES ADVOCATING FOR.
FIRST OF ALL THAT IS WHAT WEARE MAKING THEM DO RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHO IS AGAINST THIS,GIVE ME A NAME?
HONESTLY, LIKE IT'S TIME TOLIKE, TAKE THE COVERS OFF.
THIS IS SUCH AND PARDON ME,BULL [BLEEP].
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT IT'S INSANE.
SO WHO IS IT IN THE CONGRESSWHO WOULD BE AGAINST IT, I
WANT THEIR NAMES.
>> WELL, THE FIGHT IS NOTOVER AND I AM HOPING THAT WE
PASS THIS BILL UNANIMOUSLY,UNANIMOUSLY.
AND WE NEED TO GET--
>> Jon: BUT NOT A FIVE YEARTHING, NOT WHERE THEY HAVE
TO FEEL UNCERTAIN ABOUTTHEIR HEALTH FUTURE.
>> SO THE PUSHBACK TODAY ISOH, WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST
HAVE A FIVE YEAR BILL, THISWOULD BE A PERMANENT BILL.
>> Jon: YES.
>> WHEN YOU GO WORK AT ANUCLEAR SITE AND YOUR HEALTH
CARE IS COVERED FOREVER.
IT'S PERMANENT -- THERE AREMANY THINGS LIKE THIS.
>> Jon: WHY IS BOMBINGCOUNTRIES NOT PAY AS YOU GO?
WHY DO THEY NOT HAVE TO HAVEAN EASY PASS EVERY TIME--
I KNOW, YOU KNOW, YOU LIKE TOTHINK THIS IS GRAND STANDING,
IT'S DEMAGOGUERY, BUT IT'SNOT BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL
SITTING SENATORS WHO AREBLOCKING THIS.
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?
GIVE ME A NAME OF A GUY DOINGTHE RIGHT THING.
>> SUSAN COLLINS, LISAMURKOWSKI.
>> Jon: DOING THE RIGHTTHING.
WHO ELSE?
>> MARK KIRK.
>> Jon: HE'S DOING THE RIGHTTHING -- TOM COTTON IS DOING
THE RIGHT THING AND THATGUY IS [BLEEP] NUTS.
AND HE'S DOING THE RIGHTTHING, RIGHT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING TO TAKEA COMMERCIAL BREAK AND
TALK-- WE'RE NOT LETING THISGO THIS TIME.
BECAUSE THIS ONE, HONESTLY,IS THE MOST GALLING EXAMPLE
OF A LEGISLATURE REMOVEDFROM THE PURPOSE OF THEIR
JOB AND FROM THE PATRIOTISMFLAG THAT THEY WAVE SO
HEARTILY WHEN IT SERVESTHEIR NEEDS.
WE WILL GET MORE WITHSENATOR GILLIBRAND.
