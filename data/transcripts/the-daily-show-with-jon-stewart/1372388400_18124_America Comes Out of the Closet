>> BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH
THE SUPREME COURT, LANDMARK
RULINGS YESTERDAY, STRIKING
DOWN PART OF THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT AND PROP 8 IN
CALIFORNIA.
A HUGE DAY!
A HUGE DAY FOR CIVIL RIGHTS
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> AND ALL OF THIS IS THE
SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S SPECIAL
REPORT.
>> YES, YESTERDAY AMERICA
TOOK A GIANT BOLD LEAP INTO
THE PRESENT.
AND IT WAS A 5-4 DECISION
WITH ONE JUDGE IN PARTICULAR
MAKING THE DIFFERENCE.
>> THE IMPORTANCE OF ANTHONY
KENNEDY CANNOT BE
OVERSTATED.
>> THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN
THREE GAY RIGHTS, MAJOR GAY
RIGHTS DECISIONS IN THE
HISTORY OF THE SUPREME
COURT.
>> ALL THREE OF THOSE CASES
WERE WRITTEN BY ANTHONY
KENNEDY.
HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY
AS IN ESSENCE THE FATHER OF
CONSTITUTIONAL GAY RIGHTS.
>> YEAH, AND THE GOOD KIND
OF FATHER OF SOMETHING GAY.
NOT THE KIND OF FATHER WHO
INSISTS YOU THROW A FOOTBALL
WITH HIM AND IT WOULD NEVER
COME TO A SINGLE ONE OF YOUR
SHOW CHOIR PERFORMANCES.
YOU MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S
IMPORTANT, DAD, BUT IT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME!
OF COURSE-- OF COURSE.
NOT EVERY ONE WAS HAPPY WITH
THIS DECISION.
BUT SOMEONE WAS EXACTLY AS
UNHAPPY WITH IT AS YOU WOULD
IMAGINE.
SCALIA.
THE JUSTICE WHOSE NAME MOST
RESEMBLES A G.I. JOE VILLEAN.
>> HE SAID THE COURT A
OPINION TALKING ABOUT THE
ONE STRIKING DOWN DOMA
SPRINGS FROM THE SAME
DISEASED ROOT AND EXALTED
NOTION OF THE ROLE OF THIS
COURT IN AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC
SOCIETY.
>> HE CALLED IT LEGALLISTIC
ARGLE FARGEL?
>> WHOA, WHOA, ARGLE FARGEL
IS A LITTLE HAR BE, ISN'T
IT?
OR IS IT?
I DONE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
THESE SUPREME COURT SCHOLARS
ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH
TIME INTERPRETING THAT IN
THE FUTURE.
IT COULD MEAN IT'S ANGRY T
COULD MEAN HE'S CHOKING ON A
PEN TOP.
IT COULD MEAN HE WAS SCUBA
DIVING AT THE TIME AND
TRYING TO COMMUNICATE VIA
SONAR.
ARGLE FARGEL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
