>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WHAT A NIGHT!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT A NIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS -- MY GUEST
TONIGHT HIS STORY CONSTITUTIONAL
SCHOLAR RICHARD BEEMAN, HALF
BEE, HALF MAN ALL HISTORIAN.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
LET ME TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT
TONIGHT WITHIN THE REALM OF
PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS.
YOU MAY REMEMBER A WEEK AGO FORM
ER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND
LEAGUEO FIGURINE MODEL NEWT
GINGRICH DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY.
YOU MIGHT THINK THE PARTY OF
FAMILY VALUES MAY HAVE PROBLEMS.
THE TWICE DIVORCED SANCTIONED ON
ETHICS CHARGES FORMER SPEAK OF
THE HOUSE.
WOULD YOU BE WRONG.
>> NEWT GINGRICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN
AN IDEAS MONEY AND WILL PROVIDE
A LOT OF POSITIVE INPUT IN THE
DEBATE.
>> FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT.
>> REMEMBER NEWT GINGRICH IS A
TOWERING CONSERVATIVE
INTELLECTUAL.
>> HE IS A SCHOLAR.
HE UNDERSTANDS WHERE WE'RE
COMING FROM.
>> HE IS ONE OF SMARTEST PEOPLE
IN AMERICA.
HE COMES UP WITH TWO IDEAS EVERY
MINUTE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HERE IS MY IMPRESSION
OF NEWT GINGRICH IN A MINUTE.
[LAUGHTER]
NONALCOHOLIC TEQUILA.
[LAUGHTER]
BOMB SNIFFING TURTLES.
[LAUGHTER]
KOSHER BACON.
[LAUGHTER]
EDIBLE DIAPERS.
[LAUGHTER]
TWO IDEAS A MINUTE BUT A LOT OF
THEM.
THE LARGER POINT IS ALL IS
FORGIVEN.
YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE
A FIRST IMPRESSION.
HE CHOSE JUST THE PLACE TO DO IT
"MEET THE PRESS."
A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF.
DAVID GREGORY SET HIM UP WITH AN
EASY ONE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PAUL RYAN'S
MEDICARE.
>> SHOULD THE REPUBLICANS CHANGE
MEDICARE?
YONCH THINK RIGHT WING SOCIAL
ENGINEERING IS ANY MORE
DESIRABLE THAN LEFT WING SOCIAL
ENGINEERING.
I DON'T THINK IMPOSING RADICAL
CHANGE FROM THE RIGHT OR THE
LEFT IS A VERY GOOD WAY FOR THE
SOCIETY TO OPERATE.
>> Jon: WOW APPEALING TO THE
MODERATE WING OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, A WING CLOSED FOR
RENOVATIONS.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M SURE THEY RESPECT THE
GRAVITAS.
>> HE DETONATED HIS CAMPAIGN ON
SUNDAY.
>> DOES HE WANT TO BE NOMINATED
BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
ONE WONDERS.
>> HE WAS NEVER A LIKABLE GUY.
>> THIS IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE.
>> HOW CAN I SAY THIS POLITELY?
HE WAS URINATING INSIDE THE
FAMILY CIRCLE.
[LAUGHTER]
>>>> Jon: WHAT WOULD THE
IMPOLITE WAY HAVE BEEN TO SAY
THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
HOW DO I PUT THIS IMPOLITELY HE
(bleep) THE GHOST OF RONALD
REAGAN AND THEN WIPED HIS
(bleep) ON TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S
BEDSPREAD.
NO DISRESPECT.
[LAUGHTER]
LEADERSHIP, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO SPEAK UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS
AND STAND BY THEM.
>> EARLIER IN THE DAY SPEAKING
ON A CONFERENCE CALL GINGRICH
TRIED TO PASS THE BLAME TO THE
ADVERSARIAL NATURE OF MEET THE
PRESS SAYING QUOTE -- "I DIDN'T
GO IN THERE QUITE HOSTILE ENOUGH
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME
THAT GOING IN WOULD YOU SPR A
SERIES OF SETUPS."
>> OH, MAN.
>> THIS WASN'T ME RANDOMLY
SAYING THINGS.
THESE WERE DELIBERATE EFFORTS TO
PICK FIGHTS."
>> Jon: I GET YOU.
YOU GOT ON THE POLITICAL SNOWS
YOU -- SHOWS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO EXPECT.
IT'S SCARY.
INTIMIDATING.
>> WELCOME BACK.
THIS IS YOUR 35th APPEARANCE
ON THE PROGRAM.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: YOU'VE BEEN ON THAT
SHOW MORE TIMES THAN DAVID
GREGORY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S NOT GOING TO FLY, NEWT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
THAT'S A TERRIBLE EXCUSE.
TRY AGAIN.
>> WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE I'M
GOING TO ON OH, I WANT TO
SHAND -- ON OBJECTION I WANT
TO -- AND I'M GOING TO ON
OCCASION I WANT TO SAY IT WAS A
MISTAKE.
I WANT TO SAY ON THE RECORD ANY
IDEA THAT QUOTES WHAT I SAID ON
SUNDAY IS SAY FALSEHOOD.
I HAVE SAID PUBLICLY THOSE WORDS
WERE INACCURATE AND UNFORTUNATE.
>>
>> Jon: I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE
HALLMARK OF ON HONEST
CONVERSATION WORKS WELL WHEN
SAYING IF YOU DON'T ME DIRECTLY
USING VIDEO TAPE OF MY
CONVERSATION YOU'RE LYING.
>> YOUR AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR
PARTY.
>> SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
>> WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT BEFORE
YOU MAKE A BIGGER FOOL OF
YOURSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THIS WAS HIS TUESDAY
BOOK SIGNINGS IN MINNEAPOLIS.
>> STOP THE HATE.
STOP ANTIGAY POLITICS.
IT'S DIVIDING OUR COUNTRY.
>> Jon: AS HOTEL TURNDOWN
