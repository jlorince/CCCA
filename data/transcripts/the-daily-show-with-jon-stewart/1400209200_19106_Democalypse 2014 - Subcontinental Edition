>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART. JIMPARSONS IS GOING TO BE
JOINING US IN THE STUDIOTONIGHT.
BUT FIRST, INDIA, A LAND OFTECHNOLOGICAL WIZARDS IS INDIA,
COLORED POWDERS, BREAD THATAPPEARS TO NEED SAUCE AND
CHEESE, A MYSTERIOUS AND EXOTICPLACE UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF THE
1.3 BILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVETHERE, THEN YOU PROBABLY DON'T
REDUCE IT TO ONE OF THE THREECULTURAL STEREOTYPES THAT WE
AMERICANS ARE AWARE OF --OH, AND CRAZY SEX POSITIONS,
FOUR STEREOTYPES. ANYWAY, THEPOINT IS,
INDIA HAD AN ELECTION. IT'S THESUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
DEMOCALYPSE 2014 SUBCONTINENTALEDITION. NOW, IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY, INDIAN CAMPAIGNSEASON JUST STARTED HEATING UP.
>> AFTER FIVE WEEKS OFBALLOTING, VOTING IN INDIA'S
MARATHON ELECTION IS NOW OVERAND THE COUNTRY WAITS TO SEE WHO
WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRIMEMINISTER.
>> AH OVER. I DIDN'T MEANHEATING UP. I MEANT IT'S OVER.
NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO WATCHON INDIAN TV? I MEAN,
IT'S MONTHS UNTIL THE NEW SEASONOF "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF
ARUNACHAL PRADESH." I REALLY,
I REALLY HOPE I SAID THATSOMEWHERE NEAR CORRECTLY.
(LAUGHTER)ANYWAY, THE RESULTS ARE NOT
FINAL YET. WHO'SIN THE RUNNING?
>> LEADING THE RULING INDIANATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY IS RAHUL
GANDHI.
>> OOH, IT'S A GANDHI. CALL ITALL, IT'S A GANDHI.
HE HAPPENS TO BE THE SON OFPRIME MINISTER
RAJIV GANDHI, GRANDSON OF PRIMEMINISTER INDIRA GANDHI AND IN NO
WAY RELATED TO THE ONLY GANDHIYOU'RE THINKING OF.
BASICALLY, IT'S INDIA.
PEOPLE ARE TRIPPING OVERGANDHIS.
HOW DOES THAT GUY NOT WIN?
>> THE FRONTRUNNER FOR THE JOBIS NARENDRA MODI.
>>HE'S THE LEADER OF THE MAINOPPOSITION PARTY.
>> MODI IS THE CHIEF MINISTER OFTHE STATE OF GUJARAT.
>> HE'S PROMISING THE COUNTRYSTRONGER LEADERSHIP AND FASTERGROWTH.
>> WHAT HE DID INGUJARAT IS JUST AMAZING,
CHIEF MINISTER WITH 5% OF THEPOPULATION
HE CAPTURED 25% OF THE EXPORTSOF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
>> IT'S A GUJARAT MIRACLE. EVERYEXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL
IN GUJARAT UPGRADED TOBEST, ALL THE SLUMDOGS
IN GUJARAT NOW MILLIONAIRES. I'DLOVE,
I'D LOVE TO DO MORE OF THOSEJOKES, BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY
OTHER MOVIES ABOUTINDIA. I'M SORRY.
THIS GUY SOUNDS INCREDIBLE.
ONCE AGAIN, I CONFIDENTLY DO NOTSEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE.
>> IN 2002, MODI WAS CHIEFMINISTER OF GUJARAT WHEN RIOTS
BROKE OUT THAT PITTED THE MUSLIMMINORTY AGAINST THE HINDU
MAJORITY.
AS MANY AS A THOUSAND MUSLIMSWERE KILLED.
MODI WAS ACCUSED OF NOT DOINGENOUGH TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.
THE U.S. REVOKED HIS VISA OVERIT.
CAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONFIND A PARTNER IN A LEADER THERE
WHO WON'T BE ALLOWED IN THEUNITED STATES?
>> THAT DOES TEND TO STRAINRELATIONS WHEN THE TWO LEADERS
CAN'T BE IN THE SAME COUNTRY ATTHE SAME TIME.
ON THE UPSIDE, GREATTEST-RUN FOR AMERICA'S NEW DRONE
DIPLOMACY PROGRAM.
BUT, MODI ASSURES VOTERS HE'SFOCUSED ON IMPROVING INDIA'S
INFRASTRUCTURE NOT DIVISIVERELIGIOUS POLITICS. A STANCE
ENCAPSULATED IN HIS SLOGAN, THISIS TRUE, "TOILETS NOT TEMPLES."
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT THE FIRSTONE THEY CAME UP WITH.
THEY TRIED "CHANGEYOU CAN RELIEVE IN" AND, OF
COURSE, THE ICONIC POSTER.
THERE YOU GO.
