[ LAUGHTER ] STILL, IF CNN ISHITTING RATINGS GOLD WITH THIS
SPECTRO-LOM-OTRO-TRON, FOX NEWSWILL NOT BE OUT-SPECULATED.
>> THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIOIN MY VIEW IN MY VIEW IS THE
PAYNE STEWART SCENARIO,SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH THE
OXYGEN ON BOARD, EVERYBODY DIED.
>> Jon: THAT SOUNDS LIKELY BUTEXPLAIN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN
WITH THE TRANSPONDERS AND, IFYOU PLEASE, ACT IT OUT WITH AS
LITTLE RESPECT FOR THE VICTIM ASPOSSIBLE.
>> WHO SHUT THE TRANSPONDERS?
>> THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEOF -- I'M CHOKING.
I'M CHOKING.
LET'S TRY GO BACK.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
EITHER GERALDO IS CALLOUSLY PLAYACTING THE REAL DEATH OF A REAL
PERSON OR HIS TONGUE HAS GONEROGUE AND DECIDED TO TAKE HIM
OUT BEFORE HIS TONGUE IS FORCEDTO SAY SOMETHING EVEN STRANGER.
BUT IT ISN'T CNN ONLY. CNN ISMISSING A LARGER STORY HERE.
>> YOU HAVE TWO PILOTS. BOTHPILOTS WERE MUSLIMS.
IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIMEFOR THEM TO BEGIN TO LOOK INTOTHE
BACKGROUNDS AND WHETHER THEY HADANY POLITICAL RADICALIZATIONS IN
THEIR BACKGROUND.
BY THE WAY, THERE'S A GOODCHANCE A SUBSTANTIAL
POPULATION OF CABINARE MUSLIMS AS WELL.
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND FINDTHE OUT WHO HAS POLITICAL TIES,
EXTREMIST TIES.
>> I BELIEVE IT'S A 65% TO 75%CHANCE I'M CORRECT THE AIRPLANE
DID NOT CRASH AND IT'S GOINGTO BE USED IN A FUTURE
RADICAL ISLAMISTTERRORIST MOVEMENT.
>> Jon: YES, DOESN'T IT SEEMSUSPICIOUS TO ANYBODY THAT A
PLANE ORIGINATING IN A MUSLIMCOUNTRY WOULD HAVE SO MANY
MUSLIM PASSENGER AND PILOTS?
IT'S A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT TOHEAR THE AIRLINES SAY IT THERE
ARE MUSLIMS AND MUSLIM PILOTSFLYING EVERY DAY WITHOUT
INCIDENT. WELL I DON'T BUY IT.
