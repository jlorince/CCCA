TELEVISION.

AN EARTHQUAKE, AND A CHOLERA
EPIDEMIC.
NOT TO WORRY.
HELP IS ON THE WAY.
>> THE MAN KNOWN AS BABY DOC
JEAN CLAUDE DUVALIER IS BACK IN
HAITI.
>> HIS POLICE FORCE SILENCED
OPPONENTS WITH MACHETES OR GUNS.
>> Jon:  HONEY, I'M HONE!
WHAT MAKES BABY DOC JEAN CLAUDE
DUVALIER THINK HE CAN GO BACK TO
HAITI NOW?
I GUESS HE LOOKS AT THE
CONDITIONS AND THINKS, HUH?
WHO HAS TWO THUMBS AND IS BETTER
THAN CHOLERA AND FAMINE?
IT'S THIS GUY!
SO HOW WAS THE DOC?
YOU AT LEAST WANT TO SEE, OTHER
THAN SAY DOOM OUR AUK, RECEIVED
IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY?
I BET THEY ARRESTED THAT FELLOW
RIGHT QUICK.
>> BABY DOC IS FACING CHARGES.
HE WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN TO HIS
HOTEL TUESDAY AFTER BEING
ESCORTED TO A PORT-AU-PRINCE
COURTHOUSE PER A HEARING.
>> Jon:  WOW DICTATOR BACK

THAT'S A PUNISHMENT MANY
HAITIANS WOULD REFER TO AS THE
GREATEST DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
AS ONE TRIES TO WORM HIS WAY
INTAK INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS,
ANOTHER BIDS ADIEU.
>> AFTER VIOLENT PROTESTS IN
TUNISIA, THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT
HAS FALLEN.

HOPE FOR THOSE IN THE REGION
PROTESTING FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT AND YET CAUSES
SADNESS FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE

FILMED.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO FOR
SPRING BREAK?
GO TO NEW ZEALAND AGAIN?
YES, YES, THIS IS THE HOUSE
GEORGE ASTTON SLEPT IN
( LAUGHTER )
BEN ALI RULED TUNISIA FOR 23
YEARS AND HIS OUSTER THROUGH
PROTEST, TOOK OBSERVERS OFF
GUARD AS TUNISIA IS CONSIDERED
THE MORE MODERATE NATION IN THE
REGION, PROTESTERS OFTEN
EXPRESSING THEIR DISPLEASURE BY
WASHING THEIR LEADER IN EFFIGY.
( LAUGHTER )
DEATH TO TYRANTS!
( LAUGHTER )
IN JUST ONE 24-HOUR PERIOD,
TUNISIA HAD THREE LEADERS.
BEN ALI WAS REPLACED AND HE WAS
THEN OVERTHROWN BY THE HEAD OF
TUNISIA'S LOWER HOUSE OF
PARLIAMENT, THANKS IN PART TO
THIS DEVASTATING CAMPAIGN AD
RELEASED.
>> HE SAYS HE'S PROUD OF THE JOB
HE'S DOING AS TUNISIA'S
PRESIDENT, BUT ASK YOURSELF--
ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW THAN YOU
WERE THREE HOWARD AGO?
>> HI, I'M FAUDE MUBAZA, AND I
LOOK AT THE HOURS OF 1:00 TO
4:00 P.M. AND THINK TUNISIA CAN
DO BETTER.
SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE WRITING, WHY
NOT INSTALL ME, FAUDE MUBAZA AS
YOUR NEW PRESIDENT.
PLEASE DON'T RISE UP AND
OVERTHROW ME.
>> Jon:  OF COURSE, TUNISIA
HAS AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS HIGH
AS 40% IN SOME REGIONS, HAS
LIVED UNDER A CORRUPT AUTO
CRACKIC REGIME, RAISING THE
QUESTION, COULD IT HAPPEN HERE?

TUNISIA.
TUNISIA.
PROTESTS BLAMED IN PART ON
THINGS LIKE FOOD PRICES.
THINGS ARE GETTING SO BAD THE
PRESIDENT OF TUNISIA FLED THE
COUNTRY.
ALL OF THISES IS AMERICANS ARE
STARTING TO GET A DOSE OF
BOOSTED INFLATION HERE, AS WELL.
MEAT AND POALT AND FISH ARE UP
5% FROM A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
DAIRY PRODUCTS UP 4%, SUGARS AND
SWEETS UP TWO%.
WE ARE SEEING OUTBREAKS OF THIS
SAME SORT OF THING ON SPIKES AND

UN-STAPLE.
