>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT MR. SALOMON
RUSHDIE WILL BE JOINING US.
I'M GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT
TALKING ABOUT PERKS.
LITTLE JOB BENEFITS, MAYBE
THE BENEFITS OF YOUR JOB
THAT MAKE IT WORTHWHILE.
THE ABILITY TO WORK FROM
HOME, PERHAPS A PERK.
A MACHINE THAT DISPENSES THE
FREE COFFEE, A PERK.
IMMUNITY FROM MURDER CHARGES,
A PERK.
BUT AS "60 MINUTES" TAUGHT
US A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
THERE MAY BE NO BETTER PERK
THAN THE ONE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS RECEIVE.
>> CONGRESS LAWMAKERS HAVE
NO CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
AND HAVE LONG BEEN
CONSIDERED EXEMPT FROM
INSIDER TRADING LAWS, EVEN
THOUGH THEY HAVE DAILY
ACCESS TO NONPUBLIC
INFORMATION AND PLENTY OF
OPPORTUNITIES TO TRADE ON
IT.
>> IF YOU ARE ON THE SENATE
BANKING COMMITTEE, YOU CAN
TRADE BANK STOCK AS MUCH AS
YOU WANT.
AND THAT REGULARLY GOES ON
IN ALL THESE COMMITTEES.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU
WILL--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: MY IMPRESSION OF THE
SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE
SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE
MEETING FOLLOWING SOME
CRUCIAL DECISIONS ON
FINANCIAL REGULATIONS.
OKAY.
>> HEY, CAN WE TAKE A FIVE,
I GOT TO RUN QUICK TO CALL
MY BROKER TO MAKE A [BLEEP]
OF MONEY BASED ON WHAT JUST
HAPPENED IN HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I MEAN PEE.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE TO GO PEE.
[BLEEP] LOAD OF MONEY.
SO APPARENTLY THE LAW OF THE
LAND WAS IT IS ABSOLUTELY
FOREGID-- FORBIDDEN FOR
ANYONE IN AMERICA TO INSIDER
TRADE UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO
BE ACCESSING THE BEST
POSSIBLE, PURIST FORM OF
INSIDE INFORMATION.
IT'S LIKE SAYING NO ONE IS A
AROUND ALLOWED TO USE
RECREATIONAL DRUGS UNLESS IT
IS THAT 100% PURE MEDICAL
KRAD COCAINE AND
THEN-- AMAZINGLY LAST APRIL
THAT "60 MINUTES" PIECE
YIELDED RESULTS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNING
THE SO-CALLED STOCK ACT
TODAY.
>> NOW GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME
INSIDER TRADING RULES AS
EVERYBODY ELSE.
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE,
AN ACRONYM, THE STOP ACT OR
STOP TRADING ON
CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE ACT.
IT WAS PASSED I GUESS
BECAUSE THE FISCAL USE OF
CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS
EXPRESSLY RESTRICTED ACT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> PURE ON THE NOSE.
ANYWAY-- THE STOCK ACT-- IS
THERE NOTHING I CANNOT TURN
INTO VULGARITY.
I AM THE MIDAS OF PROFANITY.
THE STOCK ACT WAS DESIGNED
TO DO THREE THINGS.
ONE, BRING A LITTLE
TRANSPARENCY TO THIS INSIDER
INFORMATION CASH GRAB
MACHINE.
TWO, STOCK LAWMAKER-- STOP
LAWMAKERS AND THEIR STAFF
FROM USING SAID CASH GRAB
MACHINE AND THREE STOP WELL
CONNECTED INVESTORS FROM
GAINING ACCESS TO THE INSIDE
INFORMATION CASH GRAB
MACHINE ONCE THE
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF WAS THEN
USED.
WELL CONNECTED INVESTORS GOT
TO IT BEFORE IT GOT TO O AM
ABOUTA'S DESK I ASSUME
PURELY BY PERSUASIVE AND
RATIONAL ARGUMENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
SOMETHING LIKE HEY, WHERE DO
YOU THINK ARE YOU GOING WITH
THAT MONEY MACHINE.
NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH.
BUT STILL T WAS A GOOD DAY.
>> I'M VERY PROUD TO SIGN
THIS BILL INTO LAW.
I SHOULD SAY THAT OUR WORK
ISN'T DONE.
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE THAT
WE CAN DO TO CLOSE THE
DEFICIT OF TRUST AND LIMIT
THE COROSSIVE INFLUENCE OF
MONEY AND POLITICS.
>> Jon: I LOVE THAT, LIMIT
THE COROSSIVE INFLUENCE.
LET'S FACE T THERE HAS TO BE
COROSSIVE INFLUENCE OF MONEY
AND POLITICS.
WE'RE WEAK PEOPLE.
WE WILL TRY TO LIMIT IT.
LIKE THE FDA DOES WITH YOUR
FAVORITE BREAKFAST CRER
CALL-- CEREALS OF RAT POOP,
IT IS GOING TO BE THERE IN.
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO KEEP THAT RAT [BLEEP] OUT
OF YOUR CEREAL.
YOU EAT IT AND YOU ARE LIKE
I'M MOSTLY CEREAL HERE, IT
IS VERY DEI WILL HAVE
HAVECIOUS-- DELICIOUS.
I'M JUST GETTING SOME-- OF
RAT POOP AND JUST A HINT OF
THE MAGAZINEOUTS.
-- MAGGOTS, BUT TWO OUT OF
THREE IS NOT BAD, HUH?
>> CONGRESS HAS KILLED A
MANDATE THAT CONGRESSIONAL
STAFFERS AND EXECUTIVE
BRANCH EMPLOYEES POST THEIR
FINANCIAL-DISCLOSURE FORMS
ON-LINE.
>> Jon: WELL, ONE OUT OF
THREE IS NOT BAD.
33%, IT'S STILL A
