( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
HERE'S OUR SEGMENT WE CALL "BACK IN BLACK."
>> ARIZONA'S NEW IMMIGRATION LAW HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTRAGED.
SOME PEOPLE MORE THAN OTHERS.
>> SOME HAVE LIGHTENED HAVING TO CARRY PAPERS AROUND TO NAZI GERMANY.
>> THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HYPERBOLE TO COMPARE ARIZONA TO NAZI GERMANY.
FIRST OF ALL, NAZI GERMANY HAD A MUCH NICER CLIMATE.
( LAUGHTER ) BUT NOW, ALL THIS OUTRAGE HAS PEOPLE OUTRAGED AT THE OUTRAGE.
>> YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND!
ARE YOU COMPARING THE SYSTEMISTIC, COLD-BLOOD EXTERMINATION OF MILLIONS OF
JEWS TO AMERICA MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HERE LEGALLY?
ARIZONA SURE IS PUTTING THE "AZ" IN NAZI, AREN'T THEY?
( LAUGHTER ) DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE HIM, DID YOU?
GLENN BECK IS OFFENDED!
GLENN BECK THINKS PLAYING THE NAZI CARD IS GOING TOO FAR.
GLENN BECK.
THIS IS A GUY WHO USES MORE SWASTIKA PROPS AND VIDEO OF THE NUREMBERG RALLIES THAN THE
HISTORY CHANNEL.
( LAUGHTER ) FOR GOD'S SAKE!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOR GOD'S SAKE.
HE COMPARED GLOBAL WARMING TO NUTSY GERMANY.
>> THAT WAS HITLER'S PLAN-- HIS ENEMY, THE JEW, AL GORE'S ENEMY,
THE U.N.'S ENEMY, GLOBAL WARMING.
>> I'M NOT ACCUSING AL GORE OF BEING A NAZI OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
>> YES, YOU ARE!
YOU JUST DID IT!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOTE TO GLENN BECK: I'VE MET AL GORE.
AL GORE IS NO ADOLF HITLER.
HITLER HAD CHARISMA.
( LAUGHTER ) ALL GLENN BECK NEEDS IS A SINGLE WORD TO SEND HIM INTO A NEETSY
TIZZY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKING ABOUT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
>> I VIEW THAT QUALITY OF EMPATHY, OF UNDERSTANDING, AND IDENTIFYING WITH PEOPLE'S HOPES
AND STRUGGLES AS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR ARRIVING AT JUST DECISIONS AND OUTCOMES.
>> DID YOU CATCH IT?
NEITHER DID I.
BET GUESS WHO DID?
>> HITLER DECIDED THAT IT WAS THE ONLY EMPATHETIC THING TO DO IS TO PUT THIS CHILD DOWN AND
PUT HIM OUT OF HIS SUFFERING.
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE T4,
WHICH LED TO GENOCIDE EVERYWHERE.
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF IT.
EMPATHY LEADS YOU TO VERY BAD DECISIONS MANY TIMES.
( LAUGHTER )
>> IN ONE PARAGRAPH, GLENN BECK TIED ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE
WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TO HITLER'S GENOCIDE.
( LAUGHTER ) IT'S SIX DEGREES OF KEVIN BACON,
EXCEPT THERE'S JUST ONE DEGREE,
AND KEVIN BACON IS HITLER.
( LAUGHTER ) OH, CAN I PLAY?
LET'S SEE.
MOTHER THERESA, MOTHER THERESA HAD A MUSTACHE.
HITLER HAD A MUSTACHE.
MOTHER TERESA IS HITLER!
THIS IS EASY!
AND IT WORKS FOR ANYTHING.
THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS.
>> ADVOCATING THROUGH ART IS KNOWN AS PROPAGANDA.
YOU SHOULD LOOK UP THE NAME GOEBBELS.
>> TEACHING KIDS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> SOME MAY BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE ROAD TO THE HITLER YOUTH.
>> ACORN.
>> THESE ARE THE BROWNSHIRTS.
>> TARP!
>> IT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST COUNTRY OF GERMANY IN THE 1930s UNDER HITLER.
>> THE PEACE CORPS-- SERIOUSLY,
THE ( BLEEP ) PEACE CORPS!
>> THIS IS WHAT HITLER DID WITH THE S.S.
>> GLENN BECK HAS NAZI TOURETTES.
>> YOU EVER HEARD THE OLD POEM,
FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE JEWS?
FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE BANKS.
THEN IT WAS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
THEN IT WAS THE CAR COMPANIES.
>> GLENN, GET A GRIP!
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE!
THEY CAME FOR THE JEWS TO KILL THEM!
THEY CAME FOR THE BANKS AND THE CAR COMPANIES TO GIVE THEM $700 BILLION!
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS ) IF THAT'S COMING FOR THEM, THEN COME FOR ME!
FOR $700 BILLION, I'LL GO TO YOU!
UNLESS IT'S NOT ME THEY'RE AFTER.
GEE, I WONDER WHO THEY COULD BE AFTER.
>> FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE JEWS,
AND I STAYED SILENT.
NEXT I'LL SHOW YOU THE VERY LATEST ATTACKS ON ME.
>> YES, GLENN, THE NAZIS ARE EVERYWHERE.
( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU'RE NOT SAFE.
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO AND TAKE IT FROM ME, MY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.
FIRST, YOU GOTTA FIND A NEST.
AND THEN HIDE THERE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS, AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T MAKE A SOUND.
