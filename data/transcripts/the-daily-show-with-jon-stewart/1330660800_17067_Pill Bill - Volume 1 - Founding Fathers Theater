FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY OWN WAY
OF DEVINING HOW THE FRAMERS
WOULD REACT TO MODERN
SCENARIOS.
TO FIND OUT JOIN ME AT A
LOCAL WALGREEN'S FOR AN
INSTALLMENT OF THE DAILY
SHOW'S NEW SEGMENT.
AH, YES!
HELLO!
AH, HELLO, HELLO!
AH, YES!
HELLO, MY GOOD A BOTH CARRY.
I AM THOMAS JEFFERSON, I WAS
WONDERING IF I MIGHT PROVE
YOU A QUESTION.
I HAVE THIS SLAVE SALLY--
(LAUGHTER)
>> OF LATE I'VE BEEN
SLIPPING HER A BIT OF THE
OLD VIRGINIA HAM.
(LAUGHTER)
HONEY CURED, IF YOU MUST

WELL, I'LL JUST [BLEEP] TAKE
THE WIG OFF HOURX ABOUT THAT
I WILL TAKE THE WIG OFF AND
JUST TURN.
(LAUGHTER)
