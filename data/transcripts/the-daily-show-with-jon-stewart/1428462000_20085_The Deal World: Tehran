>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUSPROGRAM THAT WE HAVE CRAFTED.
ARTISANLY FROM THE FRESHESTINGREDIENTS.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT PETERDINKLAGE FROM THE "GAME OF
THRONES"!
IT'S A GAME INVOLVING THRONES.
BUT WE BEGIN WITH RECENT VERYEXCITING INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY
NEWS.
>> A BREAKTHROUGH DEAL TO LIMITIRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
>> THE HISTORIC DEAL REACHEDBETWEEN IRAN, THE UNITED STATES
AND FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES.
>> Jon: BOOM.
OR, ACTUALLY NOT BOOM.
NOT BOOM.
NOT BOOM, SOMETHING HAPPENEDWITHOUT A BOOM. THE DEAL CAME AT
THE END OF AN EXCITING WEEK THATBEGAN WITH TOP DIPLOMATS PULLING
RED BULL FUELED ALL NIGHTERSIN HOTEL ROOMS AND ENDED WITH
EVERYDAY IRANIANS CELEBRATING INTHE STREETS AND ENDED WITH
INCLUDING AN IMPROMPTU STREETPERFORMANCE BY 90s SENSATION
PERSIAN KID AND PLAY.
OBAMA'S REMARKS ON THE DEALWERE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE,
BROADCAST INTO THE LIVING ROOMSOF ORDINARY IRANIANS.
>> MANY MARKED THE MOMENT BYTAKING SELFIES WITH THEIR
TELEVISIONS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, OUR CULTURES,OUR CULTURES ARE NOT SO
DIFFERENT.
I ACTUALLY GOT CAUGHT DOINGTHE SAME THING WATCHING "NAKED
AND AFRAID". I -- OH WOW, ISTHAT -- OH I DIDN'T --
YOU CAN SEE MY THIRDMICKEY MOUSE EAR SHAPED NIPPLE
IN THE MIDDLE OF MY -- I JUSTTHOUGHT I WOULD POINT
THAT OUT.
SO IRANIANS ARE EXCITEDBECAUSE ANY NUCLEAR DEAL WOULD
INVOLVE LIFTING THEINTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN CRIPPLING THEIRECONOMY.
BUT WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLYGIVING UP IN EXCHANGE?
>> IT REQUIRES IRAN NOT TOENRICH URANIUM TO WEAPONS
GRADE FOR 15 YEARS.
>> REDUCE THE NUMBEROF CENTRIFUGES FROM ABOUT
19,000 TO 6,100.
>> DISMANTLE A PLUTONIUMREACTOR, WHICH IS ANOTHER PATH
TO THE BOMB.
>> THE AGREEMENT ALSO CALLS FORSTRICT U.N. INSPECTIONS.
>> Jon: AND THEY MUST DOWNGRADEITS OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF
BELLIGERENCE FROM DEATH TOAMERICA TO HEMORRHOIDS AND
BUNIONS TO AMERICA.
THAT'S THE FINAL -- NOW OPENINGTHEIR, OPENING THEIR FACILITIES
TO INSPECTORS, DELAYINGPRODUCTION FOR A DECADE.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
>> THERE IS NO DEAL.
>> Jon: SAY WHAT -- THERE IS NODEAL?
>> THIS IS A DETAILEDFRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE
NEGOTIATIONS, NOT A DONE DEAL.
>> Jon: REALLY? BECAUSE IBELIEVED THE 80-POINT FONT
GRAPHIC NEXT TO YOUR HEADWOULD BEG TO DIFFER.
GENERALLY WHEN ONE STANDSNEXT TO A GIANT HISTORIC NUCLEAR
DEAL SIGN, IT IS IN REFERENCE TOA HISTORIC NUCLEAR DEAL,
NOT SOME OTHER -- OH,YOU CHANGED IT.
OKAY.
THAT'S -- TOUCHE.
ALL RIGHT.
WAIT.
WAIT, IF THIS ISN'T A DONE DEAL,WHAT LEVEL OF DEAL DONENESS IS
IT AT?
>> IT IS SORT OF LIKE YOU SIGNEDA CONTRACT TO PURCHASE A HOME,
BUT YOU STILL HAVE GOT THEAPPRAISAL, THE INSPECTOR, YOU
HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEREISN'T SOME KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL
DISASTER ON THE LAND.
>> Jon: UGH.
WE GET IT.
YOU HAVE TO MOVE SOON.
WE KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
DOES ANYONE HAVE A METAPHOR FORTHIS AGREEMENT THAT STARTS OUT
SENSIBLE AND THEN GETS KIND OFWEIRDLY CREEPY?
>> THE METAPHOR I THINK ABOUT,JUDY, IS A WEDDING ENGAGEMENT,
THERE IS GOING TO BE VIGOROUSDEBATES ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE
DOWRY AND THE PRENUPTIALAGREEMENT.
AND IF INDEED THE WEDDINGHAPPENS ON TIME, WHICH IS --
YOU KNOW, PAST AS PRECEDENT, ITWILL LIKELY BE DELAYED, THE
MARRIAGE IS GOING TOHAVE PROFOUND MISTRUST
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES ANDMANY SABOTEURS.
>> Jon: SABOTEURS? WHEN WAS THELAST TIME YOU WERE AT A WEDDING?
THE 1400S?
IF ANYONE HAS ANY REASON THISMAN AND WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE
MARRIED, PLEASE SABOTAGE THEIRDOWRY.
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLYHISTORIC. TWO COUNTRIES,
AMERICA AND IRAN WHO HAVEN'TBEEN ON SPEAKING TERMS SINCE
1979 COULD STILL FIND A CHANCETO REACH A DIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT.
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF INSPIRING.
>> BUT THE AGREEMENT COULD BEDERAILED BY CONGRESSIONAL
REPUBLICANS.
>> Jon: WELL, I MEAN, COME ON.ARE YOU REALLY SAYING ANYTHING
THERE? I MEAN, BUT THE AGREEMENTCOULD BE DERAILED BY
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS,IS LIKE THE POLITICAL
VERSION OF SAYING IN BED AFTERYOU READ YOUR FORTUNE COOKIE.
IT'S YOU WILL MEET YOUR TRUELOVE AND SHARE A HAPPY FUTURE,
BUT THE AGREEMENT COULD BEDERAILED BY
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS.
>> THE TERMS ANNOUNCED TODAY ARENOT AS BAD AS I HAD FEARED.
THEY ARE MUCH WORSE.
>> WHY IS A NUCLEAR IRAN SOSCARY TO US?  IT IS BECAUSE IRAN
HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE ADESTABILIZING FORCE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
>> Jon: YES.
IF ANY NUCLEAR POWER IS GOING TODESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST, IT
WILL CONTINUE TO BE US.
EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THECONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESSIONALREPUBLICANS COMPLAINED ABOUT
THIS DEAL.
>> I AM SURE THEY THINK IT'S AGOOD DEAL BUT WE DIFFER.
I THINK THIS IS A BAD DEAL.
I THINK FOR THE PREIMMINENTTERRORIST STATE OF OUR TIME TO
HAVE A FREE PASS, AN EASY PASSTO NUCLEAR WEAPONS ENDANGERS
ISRAEL, ENDANGERS THE REGION,ENDANGERS THE WORLD, ENDANGERS
EVERYONE LISTENING TO ME RIGHTNOW.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T START WITHENDANGERS THE WORLD AND END WITH
AND EVERYONE WHO IS LISTENING TOTHIS WEEK WITH
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULUS, THATIS A DEESCALATION.
IRAN IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREATTO THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AS WELL
AS YOUR VIEWERS.
A SMALL GROUP OF WASHINGTONPOLICY WONKS AND ELDERLY VIEWERS
TOO WEAK TO CHANGE THE CHANNELFROM THE SUNDAY MORNING
MEDIA (BLEEP) SHOW.
SO ALL RIGHT, CONSERVATIVES ANDREPUBLICANS THINK IT IS A
BAD DEAL. WHAT SHOULDTHE DEAL HAVE BEEN?
>> IS THE CURRENT DEAL ON THETABLE TOUGH ENOUGH?
>> IRAN SHOULD NOT HAVE ANYURANIUM ENRICHMENT CAPABILITY AT
ALL.
>> THE DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.
>> THEY NEED TO IMMEDIATELYDESTROY ANY NUCLEAR MATERIALS
THAT THEY HAVE.
>> AMERICA CAVED.
>> WE LOOK IMPOTENT.
WE LOOK WEAK.
>> IT IS TIME FOR AMERICANLEADERSHIP, NOT SURRENDER.
>> YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE WITHBULLIES.
YOU PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE.
>> WHY ARE WE EVEN SITTING ATTHE TABLE?
>> I THINK IT IS TIME TO BOMBIRAN.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT WENT SOUTHREAL (BLEEP) FAST.
