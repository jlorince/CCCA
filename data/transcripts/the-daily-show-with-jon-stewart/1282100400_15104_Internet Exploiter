AS YOU KNOW, AS YOU KNOW, I LOVE
KEEPING UP ON LATEST WEB TRENDS.
NOTHING GETS BY ME.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M LIKE A HAWK.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M LIKE A HAWK.
[LAUGHTER]
A LION.
[LAUGHTER]
POUNCING ON THE NEWEST WEB
STUFF.
THAT'S WHAT OUR NEW SEGMENT IS
ALL ABOUT:  JON STEWART --
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT HOW WE'RE GOING TO NAME
IT THAT?
IS THAT HOW --
[LAUGHTER]
I AM GOING TO COME TO REHEARSAL
TOMORROW.
[LAUGHTER]
TONIGHT'S TOPIC NET NEUTRALITY.
ON ONE SIDE THOSE WHO WANT THE
INTERNET TO REMAIN A WIDE OPEN
MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS.
ON THE OTHER SIDE A LARGER GROUP
WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MOVES.
A FEW YEARS AGO A GOOGLE VICE
PRESIDENT AND ONE OF INVENTORS
OF THE INTERNET PUT IT BEST.
>> THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE AT
THIS POINT IS THAT IN THE
ABSENCE OF SOME FORM OF
PROTECTION THAT THE BROADBAND
SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE
TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE
CONSUMERS AS TO WHICH PRODUCTS
AND SERVICES THEY ARE ABLE TO
MEET.
WE MUST PRESERVE NEUTRALITY IN
THIS SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ALLOW
NEW GOOGLES OF THE WORLD, NEW
YAHOOS, NEW AMAZON'S TO FORM.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
THE MOTTO IS DON'T BE EVIL.
THEY WOULD OPPOSE CORPORATIONS
GETTING TOGETHER TO DECIDE WHAT
YOU CAN AND CANNOT SEE ON THE
INTERNET.
AM I CORRECT.
>> GOING IS DISCUSSING A
SEPARATE INTERNET FOR WIRELESS
DEVICES ONLY.
>> Jon: WHAT?
IN FOUR YEARS GOOGLE THE DON'T
BE EVIL EMPIRE HAS GONE FROM NET
NEUTRALITY WILL ALLOW NEW
GOOGLES AND AMAZON'S TO FORM TO
NET NEUTRALITY WILL ALLOW NEW
GOOGLES AND AMAL ZON'S TO FORM.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST A CHANGE UNTIL TONE.
>> COULD YOU HAVE VERIZON
DECIDING I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
WEB SITES HUFFINGTON POST AND
RUSH LIMBAUGH'S SITE AND I'M
GOING TO SKY THAT RUSH LIMBAUGH
GETS FASTER ACCESS SO PEOPLE CAN
GET THERE QUICKER.
THE OTHER POPBLT IS THAT A
CARRIER LIKE VERIZON OR AT&T
COULD MAKE THE REVERSE DECISION
AND IT COULD MAKE HUFFINGTON
POST LARGER AND RUSH LIMBAUGH
SMALLER.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, HUFF OR
RUSH COULD RUN FASTER OR SLOWER
ON MY DROID PHONE.
WHAT ABOUT PORN?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DON'T NEED TO GIVE UP PEOPLE.
I'M NOT AFRAID.
GOOGLE DOESN'T GET TO WRITE
LAWS.
THEY JUST PHOTOGRAPH AND POST
WHERE EVERYBODY LIVES.
[LAUGHTER]
AND REPUBLISH EVERY BOOK EVER
WRITTEN AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT WHILE
BUILDING DATA CENTERS IN THE
OCEAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'VE GOT NET NEUTRALITY
ACTIVITYIES -- ACTIVISTS
FIGHTING BACK.
THEY HEADED DAWN TO GOOGLE AND
MADE THEIR ANGER KNOWN.
