>> Jon: WELCOMEnb TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
TONIGHT WE'RE VERY EXCITED ONE OF OUR FAVORITE FORMER SECRETARY MADELEINE ALBRIGHT IS JOINING.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ONGOING SCANDAL AND THE SECRET SERVICE'S SHAH MAN IN AGAVES
DOWN IN CART HANEA.
WHEN THEY TRAVELED EARLER THIS MONTH.
A TEAM IS.
>> AS THE INVESTIGATION ENTERS ITS SECOND WEEK SIX OF 12 SECRET SERVICE AGENTS IMPLICATED
RESIGNED OR WERE FIRED.
THERE'S WORD OF ANOTHER AGENT WHO HAS TAKEN A PROSTITUTE TO A SENSITIVE LOCATION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: I WOULD ASSUME,
GENERAL, IT'S STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE.
VIS-A-VIS PROSTITUTE AND THEIR LOCATIONS AND RESPECTIVE SENSITIVITY.
NOBODY WANTS SOMEONE TO RUB THEIR ELBOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
THIS IS TAKING OUR FINEST POLITICAL REPORTERS ON A WHIRLWIND TOUR OF WHATEVER IS
SPANISH FOR MOWLIN ROUGE.
>> THE TOURIST TRADE HERE IS VERY POPULAR.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE APPROACHED ON EVERY CORNER.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF SINGLE SCANNEDLY CLAD WOMEN HANG OUT IN THE AREAS WHERE THE
SECRET SERVICE MEN WERE PARTYING.
>> Jon: WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THESE WOMEN SMELL AMAZING.
AN INTOXICATING MIST OF LAVENDER AND ONE OTHER THING WE'VE FOUND HERE IS THAT BREAST GLITTER
DOESN'T COME OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S LIKE IMPERIOUS TO LINT ROLLERS.
THIS IS THE REPORTER FOR VERY LONELY PLANET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS ALL OF AS THE SCANDAL IS THE THING THAT AMAZED ME THE MOST CAME OUT AS A SIDE NOTE.
>> DAVID CHANEY A SECRET SERVICE SUPERVISOR FACES SCRUTINY FOR THIS PHOTO THAT REPORTEDLY
SURFACED ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE SHOWING HIM ON SARAH PALIN'S SECURITY DETAIL.
HIS POST SAID I WAS REALLY CHECKING HER OUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT REALLY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT YOU MEAN.
YOU WERE CHECKING HER OUT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S A SINGLE ENTENDRE, NOBODY THINKS
SHE'S A LIBRARY BOOK AND WE'RE CONFUSED.
SECOND, HOW THE (bleep) DOES A SECRET SERVICE GUY HAVE A FACEBOOK BOOK WHERE HE POSTS
PICTURES OF WHO HE'S PROTECTING.
CHECK IT OUT IT'S ME.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
SECRET GUYS ON FOURSQUARE, TOO?
JUST CHECKING IN AT THE PREVIOUS'S PREVIOUSLY UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.
