>> Jon:  IT'S ME!
WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW."
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FILM
MAKERS BEHIND THE NEW MOVIE
"PUSSY RIOT."
CALM DOWN.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S ABOUT RUSSIAN POLITICAL
DISSIDENTS AND THEIR ADORABLE
CATS.
( LAUGHTER )
FIRST THINGS FIRST, LAST MONDAY
WAS MEMORIAL DAY, SO LIKE MOST
AMERICANS, WE TOOK THE WHOLE
WEEK OFF.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
( LAUGHTER )
ONE BELEAGUERED GOVERNMENT
BUREAU, THE I.R.S., SPENT THE
WEEK FURTHER MIRED IN A SCANDAL
THAT STEMS FROM ACCUSATIONS THAT
ITS AGENTS PARTICULARLY TARGETED
RIGHT WING GROUPS FOR SCRUTINY.
>> MORE EMBARRASSMENT THIS
MORNING FOR THE I.R.S.
>> THE I.R.S. IS FACING ANOTHER
HEADACHE.
>> THE I.R.S. IS UNDER SCRUTINY
BIG TIME.
>> Jon:  OH, NO!
( LAUGHTER )
POOR BABIES.
THE I.R.S. FACING SCRUTINY.
( LAUGHTER )
PEOPLE GETTING ALL UP.
JUST BECAUSE ONE SMALL AREA OF
THEIR BUSINESS RAISED A COUPLE
OF RED FLAGS.
NOW, EVERYBODY AT THE I.R.S. HAS
TO STOP THEIR LIVES AND PROVE
THEIR INNOCENCE.
( LAUGHTER )
OR PERHAPS WE CAN PUT THAT IN
TERMS THE I.R.S. MIGHT
UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES.
IT'S OUR NEW SEGMENT, "WHERE'S
YOUR RESEE THE AT?"
SUCKS TO GET AUDITED, DOESN'T
IT?
SUDDENLY, ACTIONS THAT SEEM
HARMLESS CAN BE PAINTED IN A
NEFARIOUS LIGHT.
WELL, WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT
WE'VE GOT.
LET'S GET STARTED.
>> THIS MAN, FORMER I.R.S.
COMMISSIONER, DOUGLAS SCHULMAN
VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE--
READY-- 157 TIMES.
WHAT THE HECK?
WAS THERE SCHULMAN DOING AT THE
WHITE HOUSE WITH THAT KIND OF
FREQUENCY?
>> Jon:  WOE!
WOE!
CAREER THE LADIES FROM THE ROOM!
I.R.S., YOUR TOO MANY FOOLERY
ALMOST MADE BILL O'REILLY SAY H,
E, DOUBLE TOOTHPICKS.
>> YOU MUST EXPLAIN UNDER OACT
WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT THE WHITE
HOUSE ON 157 SEPARATE OCCASIONS.
>> Jon:  YEAH, THAT WAS A
LOT.
ESPECIALLY SINCE HAVING THE
PRESIDENT TO TELL YOU TO USE THE
POWER OF THE I.R.S. TO DESTROY
HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES ON THE
RIGHT SHOULD REALLY ONLY TAKE
ABOUT ONE MEETING, TWO TOPS.
( LAUGHTER )
THE FIRST MEETING WILL BE LIKE,
"HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TARGET MY
POLITICAL ENEMIES?"
THEN THE NEXT 156 YOU'RE LIKE,
DYOU TAKE CARE OF THAT THING?"
( LAUGHTER ).
IT IS A GOOD QUESTION, WHAT WAS
THE I.R.S. CHAIRMAN DOING AT THE
WHITE HOUSE SO MANY TIMES?
>> MANY OF THOSE MEETINGS WERE
FOR HEALTH CARE IMPLEMENTATION.
I WAS IN THEM WITH HIM.
SO THERE'S NOTHING NEFARIOUS
GOING ON.
>> Jon:  NOTHING NEFARIOUS.
CAN'T GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SIT
AROUND THE TABLE PICKING NAMES
OF SENIORS OUT OF A HAT SO THAT
IT CAN SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GIVE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN THEIR
BIRTH CONTROL.
WITHOUT EVERYONE GETTING ALL
"WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?"
YEAH, WELCOME TO AUDIT WORLD,
I.R.S.
BY THE WAY, KEVIN COSTNER'S
SECOND WORST MOVIE.
( APPLAUSE )
IT IS A TIME ON EARTH.
MAN LIVES IN A CITY OF FORMS.
IT'S A WORLD DROWNING IN
