>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
THROUGHOUT THE FINANCIAL CHRIS
CRISIS, THAT'S RIGHT WE'RE STILL
TALKING ABOUT OUR ECONOMY HAS
BEEN GUIDED BY THE FEDERAL
RESERVE BANK WHICH IS NOW
ENGAGED IN A TRILLION PLUS
DOLLAR PROGRAM TO PROP UP THE
ECONOMY CALLED QUANTITIVE
EASING.
IT'S NOT A MADE UP PHRASE.
[LAUGHTER]
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE THINKING
IT'S WHEN THE FED BUYS UP
GOVERNMENT DEBT WITH MONEY THAT
THEY MAKE OUT OF THIN AIR.
[LAUGHTER]
SOUNDS LIKE THEY THEY ARE PRINTING
MONEY, NO-UH.
>> WE'RE NOT PRINTING MONEY.
THAT'S A MYTH OUT THERE.
>> Jon: THAT'S BEN BERNANKE
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FED.
WE'RE IN THE PRINTING MONEY
WE'RE MAIJEERIING -- IMAGINE
IMAGINING MONEY.
PRINTING IT WOULD BE MAKE IT
EASIER FOR BANKS BY BUYING UP
THEIR DEBT.
THAT WAS PRINTING MONEY.
DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
TAKE THE GUY WITH THE EXACT SAME
BEARD WITH THE EXACT SAME SHOW
TALKING TO THE SAME INTERVIEWER
NOT 21 MONTHS AGO.
>> WE USE THE COMPUTER TO MARK
UP THE SIZE OF THE ACCOUNT THEY
HAVE WITH THE FED.
SO IT'S MUCH MORE AKIN THOUGH
NOT EXACTLY THE SAME BUT IT'S
MUCH MORE AKIN TO PRINTING MONEY
THAN IT IS TO BORROWING.
>> WE'VE BEEN PRINTING MONEY?
>> EFFECTIVELY AND WE NEED TO DO
THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT?
I GUESS BERNANKE WAS LOOKING AT
THE AVERAGE AGE OF A 60 MINUTES
VIEWER AND BETTING ANYONE WHO
SAW HIM LAST YEAR IS DEAD NOW.
ADMIT IT YOU ARE A GUY WITH A
BEARD WHO IS ALLOWED TO PRINT
MONEY.
I TRIED GROWING A BEARD AND MY
POWER IF ANYTHING DIMINISHED.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S THE ABILITY TO PRINT MONEY.
THAT'S THE THING GO.
AHEAD, THEN, PRINT MONEY.
ASIDE FROM ZIMBABWE LIKE
HYPERINFLATION WHAT COULD GO
WRONG?
>> A PRINTING PROBLEM HAS FORCED
THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT MORE THAN
$1 BILLION BRAND NEW $100 BILLS
INTO STORAGE.
PRODUCTION HAS BEEN HALTED UNTIL
A FIX HAS BEEN FIGURED OUT.
>> Jon: ARE YOU (bleep) ME?
NOW WE CAN'T EVEN PRINT MONEY.
THAT WAS THE LAST THING WE WERE
GOOD AT.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> APPARENTLY THE PRINTING
PROCESS WHICH INCORPORATED HIGH
TECH FEATURES LIKE 3-D SECURITY
STRIPS IS SO COMPLEX IT'S
CAUSING BILLS TO CREASE AND FOLD
DURING PRODUCTION.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
WE'VE OUTSMARTED OURSELVES WITH
OUR OWN FANCY SECURITY MEASURES
TO THE POINT WHERE OUR MONEY IS
COMMITTING SUICIDE ON THE PRESS.
[LAUGHTER]
I HOPE WE STILL REMEMBER OUR
PASSWORDS OR AT LEAST THE
ANSWERS TO THE SECURITY
QUESTIONS PROMPTS.
WHAT IS OUR COUNTRY'S MAIDEN
NAME?
GREAT BRITTEN, I BELIEVE.
[LAUGHTER]
-- GREAT GREATAN, I BELIEVE.
THE -- GREAT BRITAIN, I BELIEVE.
THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THE ECONOMY
IS TO PRINT MONEY BUT WE CAN'T
PRINT MONEY.
THE ONLY WAY THIS COULD GET
WORSE IS IF IT SOMEHOW ADDED TO
GLOBAL WARMING.
>> IT WOULD TAKE YEARS TO SIFT
THROUGH THE CASH AND FIND THE
BAD BILLS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN
OUT AND BURNED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: IN OUTDOOR FIRES IN
