(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
GOD, YAWEH, ADUNAI.
WHATEVER YOU CALL THESUPREME BEING I THINK
EVERYONE CAN AGREE IT'S A DUDEWITH A SWEET WHITE BEARD
THAT LIVES IN THE CLOUDS.
HOW CAN THAT BE WRONG?
AND THAT DUDE HAS REALLYONLY TWO WAYS OF GETTING HIS
MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THEPEOPLE.
THE POPE, GOD'S INFALLIBLEEMISSARY ON EARTH, GOD'S
INCREDIBLY FALLIBLE EMISSARIESON EARTH, THE REPUBLICANS.
>> AND I THINK EVEN WHENLIFE BEGINS IN THAT HORRIBLE
SITUATION OF RAPE, THAT ITIS SOMETHING THAT GOD
INTENDED TO HAPPEN.
>> Jon: REALLY?
I THINK EVEN IN THATSITUATION GOD'S LIKE WHOA,
WHOA, WAIT A SECOND.
I'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR SUPER BOWLWINS AND LATIN GRAMMIES BUT
I'M GOING TO GO ALLENSMITHY ON THE RAPE BABY
THING. NOW TRADITIONALLYTHESE TWO HOLY CONDUITS HAVE
BEEN ON THE SAME PAGE.
BUT WITH THE ASCENSION OFTHIS NEW INCREDIBLY HUMBLE
WASHING THE POOR'S FEET,SLEEP ON A CONVERTIBLE SOFA,
DO YOU NEED A RIDE TO THEAIRPORT POPE, THINGS MIGHT
BE CHANGING.
>> IN A BLUNT INTERVIEW INTHE JESUIT MAGAZINE
AMERICA POPE FRANCIS SAYSTHE CHURCH CANNOT BE
OBSESSED WITH THE ISSUESTHAT DIVIDE IT.
WE CANNOT INSIST ONLY ONISSUES RELATED TO ABORTION,
GAY MARRIAGE AND THE USE OFCONTRACEPTIVE METHODS.
>> Jon: OH, ABORTION, GAYMARRIAGE AND CONTRACEPTION.
WHAT COULD HE BE REFERRINGTO.
>> REPUBLICANS ARE CALLINGTHE PRESIDENT'S NEW RULES ON
CONTRACEPTION A WAR ONRELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
>> THE AMENDMENT THAT MAYBEGOT THE MOST ATTENTION WOULD
LET SAME SEX COUPLESSPONSOR THEIR PARTNERS.
REPUBLICANS SAY IT COULDKILL THE BILL.
>> THE GOVERNMENT COULDSHOULD DOWN ON THE ISSUE OF
ABORTION.
>> THE ISSUE OF ABORTION.
>> ABORTION.
>> ABORTION.
>> A BIRTH CONTROL ISSUE.
>> CONTRACEPTIVES.
>> I WOULD RIGHT NOW BEOPPOSED TO GAY MARRIAGE.
>> MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN ONE MANAND ONE WOMAN.
>> THE FREEDOM TO BELIEVE INTRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, THAT
WAS TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE.
>> Jon: POLYGAMY-- YOU KNOW,FORGET IT, BY THE WAY, A
LESS HUMBLE POPE WOULDPROBABLY MAKE HIMSELF THE
COVER OF EVERY MONTH'S ISSUEOF, YOU KNOW, THAT MAGAZINE.
(LAUGHTER)POPRAH.
BUT BACK TO MY MAIN POINT.
HERE'S POPE FRANCIS TALKINGABOUT POOR PEOPLE.
>>> THE MEASURE OF THEGREATNESS OF THE SOCIETY IS
FOUND IN THE WAY IT TREATSTHOSE MOST IN NEED.
THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING APARTFROM THEIR POVERTY.
>> Jon: WOW.
I GUESS THAT IS ONE MEASUREOF A GREAT SOCIETY.
I MEAN YOU COULD ALSO GO BYHOW MUCH IT CAN BENCH.
OR THE NUMBER OF TWITTERFOLLOWERS.
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOODONE.
SO REPUBLICANS, THE TOPIC ISTHE POOR.
SURVEY SAYS -->> THE HOUSE VOTED TO SLASH
THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM BYNEARLY $40 BILLION OVER THE
NEXT TEN YEARS.
>> MY MOTIVATION IS ONLYBEEN TO INTRODUCE THE
BLESSING OF WORK TOABLE-BODIED PEOPLE.
>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OFTALK ABOUT SCRIPTURE.
AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUTGOD'S PLAN.
>> GOD CREATED ADAM PLACEDHIM IN THE GARDEN TO WORK
IT.
WORK IS NOT A PENALTY.
WORK IS A BLESSING.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THAT'S SOTRUE.
IT REMINDED ME OF THE SERMONON THE MOUNT.
CONSIDER THE LILLIES.
THEY TOIL NOT SO [BLEEP]THEM LAZY LILLIES.
WITH THEIR STAMMENSAND PISTELS, THOSE ARE
ONLY THE ONLY TWO PARTS IREMEMBER ON FLOWERS BUT
COASTING ON GOVERNMENTISSUE SUN AND RAIN.
FOR SOME REASON GOD HASDECIDED TO GIVE ONE MESSAGE
TO THE POPE, AND AN ENTIRELYDIFFERENT MESSAGE TO THE
WAYS HE WORKS IS SOMYSTERIOUS.
NOW I GUESS YOU COULD SAYBOY, YOU KNOW, YOUR IDEOLOGY
IS RIGID AND OUTDATED WHENTHE HEAD OF THE ORGANIZATION
THAT JUST GOT AROUND TOAPOLOGIZING TO GALILEO
SHOWS MORE FLEXIBILITYTHAN YOU BUT LOOK, YOU ARE
BOTH GOD'S MESSENGERS WHO ISTO SAY ONE OF YOU IS RIGHT
AND ONE OF YOU IS WRONG.
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OFGOD'S WILL, AS LONG AS THERE
IS NO FUNDAMENTAL SCHISMBETWEEN THIS POPE AND
REPUBLICANS.
>> AN OFF-THE-CUFF COMMENTWHILE VISITING ONE OF
ITALY'S POOREST AREAS POPEFRANCIS DENOUNCED WHAT HE
CALLED IDOLATRY OF MONEY ANDBIG BUSINESS.
>> OH NO, NOW THE [BLEEP] ISON.
YOU BETTER WATCH IT!
OR WE'RE GOING TO END UPINVADING THE VATICAN.
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
