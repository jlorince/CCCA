>>  GEOLOGISTS IN OKLAHOMA SAY
RECENT SMALL EARTHQUAKES IN THATSTATE ARE VERY LIKELY TRIGGERED
BY THE UNDERGROUND DISPOSAL OFWASTED WATER FROM OIL AND GAS
WELLS.
>> THAT STATE SHOOK BY NEARLY600 QUAKES LAST YEAR, MORE THAN
ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY.
>> UNTIL 2008 THE STATE AVERAGEDONE TO TWO QUAKES MAGNITUDE
THREE OR GREATER PER YEAR.
IN 2015, IT'S AVERAGED TWO PERDAY.

THEATER!
JEEZ, I WONDER IF THERE'S ACONNECTION BETWEEN THE UPTICK IN
INDUSTRIAL-SCALE DRILLING ANDINJECTING OF HIGH-PRESSURE FLUID
DEEP INTO THE EARTH FRACTURINGITS SHALE ROCK AND SIPHONING OUT
THE NATURAL GAS TO THE SURGE IN ( BLEEP ) FALLING OFF
OKLAHOMANS' SHELVES IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
GOVERNOR.
>> WE HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY INTHE STATE OF OKLAHOMA OF
EARTHQUAKES.
WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING AT WHATARE THE CAUSE OF THE
EARTHQUAKES?
ARE THEY MANMADE OR ARE THEYJUST A NATURAL COURSE OF NATURE
ITSELF?
>> Jon: IS IT, AS COMMON SENSEMIGHT SUGGEST, THE SEEMINGLY
OBVIOUS CONNECTION TO FRACKINGOR IS THE LORD USING OUR GREAT
STATE AS A SHAKE WEIGHT? WHOREALLY KNOWS WHAT'S --
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.
( LAUGHTER )WELL, GOOD NEWS, OKLAHOMA.
>> THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA SAID ITHAD ACCEPTED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
THAT FRACKING HAD CAUSEDHUNDREDS OF EARTHQUAKES THERE.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY, COULD YOUPLAY THE FIRST PART OF THAT
AGAIN?
>> THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA SAID ITHAD ACCEPTED SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE.
>> Jon:  YOU'VE ACCEPTEDSCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE?
( LAUGHTER )WELL, SHOVE A DRILL UP MY ASS
AND PUMP ME FULL OF HIGHPRESSURE FRACKING LIQUID!
CAUSE THAT RIGHT THERE IS THEREAL EARTHQUAKE!
THAT IS THE REAL EARTHQUAKE!
ALSO, DO THAT BECAUSE I AMFILLED WITH NATURAL GAS.
( LAUGHTER )OKLAHOMA ADMITTING YOU HAVE A
PROBLEM IS THE FIRST STEP.
NOW THE STATE GOVERNMENT CANFINALLY STEP IN AND DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THESE OIL AND GAS FRACKINGWASTEWATER DISPOSAL WELLS.
>> ONE DAY AFTER THE OKLAHOMAGEOLOGICAL SURVEY REPORTS IT IS
VERY LIKELY THAT OIL AND GASWASTEWATER DISPOSAL WELLS
TRIGGERED THE RECENTEARTHQUAKES, HOUSE LAWMAKERS
APPROVE A BILL THAT KEEPS CITIESAND TOWNS FROM REGULATING OIL
AND NATURAL GAS DRILLINGOPERATIONS.
>> Jon:  HM.
( LAUGHTER )WHAT THE ( BLEEP ), OKLAHOMA.
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST-- THAT'SJUST.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THAT'S JUST STUPID.
YOU FINALLY ADMIT THAT FRACKINGHAS TURNED YOUR STATE INTO
ONE GIANT BROOKSTONE MASSAGECHAIR AND YOUR FIRST RESPONSE IS
TO ENSURE NO ONE CAN EVER STOPIT, WHY?
>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IS THECHEAPEST WAY TO DO IT AND IT
WORKS WELL EXCEPT FOR THEEARTHQUAKES AND THE
CONTAMINATION OF GROUNDWATER.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  YES.
YES.
OTHER THAN THAN THAT, MRS. LINCOLN, HOW DID YOU ENJOY THE
PLAY?
BUT WHILE SOME STATES MAY BETURNING THEIR BACK ON MOTHER
NATURE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTIS GETTING INTO GREEN GAME IN A
WEIRD WAY.
>> HI, I'M DUNK, AND I'M THENATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY'S
RECYCLING MASCOT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  DEAR GOD,SPONGEBOB, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
TO YOU?
( LAUGHTER )NOW, I HAVE MANY, MANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS N.S.A. VIDEO.
FIRST OFF, HOW IS THE GOVERNMENTAGENCY WITH THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERTECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD NOT
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING COMPUTERGRAPHICS AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN
A 1980s DIRE STRAITS VIDEO?
FOR GOD'S SAKE.
LOOK AT THIS MASCOT.
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY FROM THEBLUE MAN GROUP ( BLEEP ) A TRASH
CAN!
IT'S THE WORST!
( LAUGHTER )BUT, OF COURSE, DUNK'S UNHOLY
BIRTH RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION.
WHAT DOES THE N.S.A. HAVE TO DOWITH RECYCLING ANYWAY?
>> N.S.A. HAS BEEN GOING GREENFOR OVER 25 YEARS.
IMPLEMENTING COUNTLESSINITIATIVES TO BE
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.
NOW, YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELFWHY DO WE NEED TO KEEP OUR STUFF
OUT OF LANDFILLS?
>> Jon:  DUNK?
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ASKINGMYSELF?
( LAUGHTER )YOU REALLY DO WORK FOR THE
N.S.A.
( LAUGHTER )SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED YOU'RE A
MONSTROSITY BORN OF THE LOVEBETWEEN SOMEONE WHO IS IN THE
BLUE MAN GROUP AND A WASTECONTAINER?
AND THAT YOU CAN READ MYTHOUGHTS AND THAT YOUR
HORRIBLE MUTANT BOX MONSTER.
TWO REASONS TO FEAR AND OBEYYOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
>> WE'RE CHALLENGING YOU TOCONDUCT A WASTE AUDIT AT YOUR
SCHOOL.
YOU'RE GOING TO DIG THROUGH ALLTHE TRASH IN YOUR SCHOOL AND
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO ANALYZE IT.
>> Jon:  HEY, KIDS, DOES ANYOF THAT TRASH HAVE PHONE NUMBERS
OR COMPUTER PASSWORDS ON IT?
DOES ANY OF THE PAPER THROWNAWAY LOOK SHREDDED?
IF SO, YOUR LITTLE FINGERSARE JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO TRY
TO PUT THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.
THINK OF IT AS A JIGSAW PUZZLETHAT INCRIMINATES YOUR TEACHERS.
>> YOU'LL NEED IDENTIFY THETYPES OF TRASH MAKING UP THE
WASTE STREAM OF YOUR SCHOOL ANDTHE AMOUNT OF EACH TYPE OF TRASH
BY WEIGHT AND VOLUME.
THEN YOU'LL USE MATH.
>> Jon:  HOLD THE PHONE!
YOU'RE TELLING ME FIRST THE KIDSGET TO GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF
GARBAGE, AND THEN FOR DESSERT,THEY GET TO USE MATH!
DUNK.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
LOOK HERE, DUNK!
( LAUGHTER )OUR KIDS GET PLENTY OF LESSONS
ON RECYCLING FROM EVERYWHEREELSE IN THE WORLD.
YOU WANT TO EDUCATE THEM, TELLTHEM N.S.A. IS REALLY UP TO.

ANY-HOO!
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ASPY AGENCY DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T
CARE ABOUT THE PLANET?
>> Jon:  SURE NO, I GUESS ISHOULDN'T BE SO CYNICAL.
THAT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,SOMETIMES, STORIES COME OUT
ABOUT CERTAIN AGENCIES THAT MAKE
IT SEEM LIKE THEY CAN'T BETRUSTED OR THEY'RE OUT TO HURT
US, RATHER THAN HELP US, WHENREALLY IN A LOT OF WAYS, WHAT--
DUNK WHAT, ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> AH, NOTHING, NOTHING.
