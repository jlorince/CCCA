BAD AS THAT I WOULD OWE MY RELATIVES MONEY.
FOR MORE WE GO TO AASIF MANDVI IN MICHIGAN AND JASON JONES IN INDIANA.
THERE'S NOT MUCH KPET ADVANTAGE IN DOING SOMETHING THAT ALMOST HALF THE OTHER STATES HAVE
ALREADY DONE.
>> HEY, JON, MICHIGAN DOESN'T HAVE TO BEAT HALF THE COUNTRY, WE JUST HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN INDIANA.
>> GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
MICHIGAN'S NOT A STATE!
IT'S MORE OF A DINGLE BERRY HANGING OFF CANADA'S -- (LAUGHTER).
>> INDIANA'S A GREAT PLACE TO SEND JOBS!
IT'S GOT THE WEATHER OF NORTH DAKOTA AND THE RACIAL HARMONY OF MISSISSIPPI!
(LAUGHTER) >> INDIANA DIDN'T TAKE MICHIGAN'S JOBS, ALL RIGHT?
MICHAEL MOORE ATE THEM!
(LAUGHTER) >> Jon: NOW THAT BOTH INDIANA AND MICHIGAN HAVE THE EXACT SAME
RIGHT TO WORK LAWS, THOUGH, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELVES?
>> RIGHT TO WORK?
JON, COME ON, THAT IS SO 11 MONTHS AGO.
INDIANA'S LATEST PRO-BUSINESS MEASURE IS THE WORKPLACE SAFETY ACT.
ANY BUSINESS THAT RELOCATES HERE GETS TO DUMP WHATEVER THEY WANT WHEREVER THEY WANT FOR FREE.
LAKES, RIVERS, WETLANDS.
THEY TAKE ALL FACTORIES TOXIC SLURRY.
>> Jon: YOU CALL THAT WORKPLACE SAFETY ACT.
>> STUDIES SHOW POISONING THE ENVIRONMENTS CUTS WORKPLACE BEAVER BITES DOWN TO ZERO.
NO MORE RACCOON MAULINGS OR SLIPPING ON THE O *D TOAD ON A FACTORY FLOOR.
DOW CHEMICAL IS VERY INTERESTING.
>> THAT'S NO MATCH FOR MICHIGAN'S LATEST PRO-BUSINESS MEASURE.
WORK FORCE EDUCATION.
>> Jon: YEAH, I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT'S NOT REALLY EDUCATING WORKERS, IS IT?
>> IT'S THE OPPOSITE!
IF YOUR BUSINESS NEEDS CHEAP WORKERS TO PULL LONG HOURS, MICHIGAN WILL TURN ITS SCHOOLS
INTO FACTORIES!
NO MORE RECESS, KIDS, NOW IT'S A FIVE-MINUTE SMOKE BREAK THEN BACK TO THE METAL-STAMP MAGAZINE!
NEWSPAPER.
>> NICE TRY.
BUT INDIANA HAS THE PENSION ACCELERATION ACT.
>> Jon: FOR GOD'S SAKE WHAT ARE YOU EUTHANIZING WORKERS WHEN THEY HIT RETIREMENT AGE?
>> COME ON!
ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT?
>> YEAH, WELL WE WILL BUILD YOU A PIT WHERE YOU CAN THROW YOUR PAYROLL AND WATCH WORKERS FIGHT
OVER IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT ARMED ONLY WITH THE BONES OF THE FORTUNATE DEAD.
>> Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, WHAT IS THAT CALLED?
>> THAT IS THE INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION BILL.
GOVERNOR SNYDER SAYS HE'S READY TO SIGN IT.
>> Jon: .
>> SON OF A BITCH!
>> WHO'S THE DINGLEBERRY NOW, JONES, HUH?
>> Jon: GUYS!
THESE MEASURES ARE CREATIVE BUT THEY DON'T CREATE JOBS.
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO POACH JOBS FROM NEIGHBORING STATES BY SELLING OUT YOUR OWN WORKERS.
IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM.
>> BUT WHOEVER GETS TO THE BOTTOM FIRST WINS, RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT.
>> THEN IT'S ON!
>> YEAH, (BLEEP)!
COME ON!
>> Jon: AASIF MANDVI
