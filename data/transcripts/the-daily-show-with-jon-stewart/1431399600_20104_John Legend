(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST
TONIGHT, HE'S EXECUTIVEPRODUCED A NEW DOCUMENTARY FOR
HBO CALLED" SOUTHERN RITES."
>> ME AND BROOKE, WE HAVEKNOWN EACH OTHER FOREVER.
LIKE SINCE GRADE SCHOOL.
>> I WENT TO PROM WHEN IT WASWHITES ONLY, BUT IT WASN'T
REALLY AS FUN AS WHEN IT WASTOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
>> EVERYBODY SHOULD BETOGETHER.
WE ALL GO TO SCHOOLTOGETHER.
I MEAN, WE GREW UP TOGETHER. ANDTHEY'RE IN SCHOOL,
SO WHY NOT GO TO PROMTOGETHER.
>> OKAY, OKAY, I COULD DOTHAT FOR YOU.
>> OKAY, FINE.
>> TWO YEARS AGO IT WASSEGREGATED, YOU HAD THE
WHITE PROM AND YOU HAD A BLACKPROM AND THAT WAS THAT.
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT,LIKE AFTER PROM WE PROBABLY
GOT TOGETHER BUT YOUCOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO A
WHITE PROM IF YOU WERE BLACKAND VICE VERSA IF IT WAS
THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AND SO IT WAS REALLY GREAT TOFINALLY COME TOGETHER AS
ONE AND DO IT.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME JOHNLEGEND.
HEY.
WELCOME, FINALLY.
>> FINALLY I'M HERE.
>> Jon: FINALLY YOU'RE HERE.
FIRST OF ALL,CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WHAT A GREAT YEAR -->> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: TWO YEARS, TEN YEARS.
>> THIS IS WHAT I HAD TO DOTO EARN MY INVITATION TO THE
DAILY SHOW.
>> Jon: WHEN I SAW YOU TENYEARS AGO I WALKED INTO A GYM
AND WATCHED JOHN LEGEND BOX ANDI WAS LIKE YOU CAN COME ON ANY
TIME YOU WANT.
THIS DOCUMENTARY IS ATSIMILAR TIMES IT IS
HEARTBREAKING BUT INCREDIBLYEFFECTIVE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THESE KIDS BREAKINGAGAINST THE BOUNDS OF
A SEGREGATED PROM, AND IT ISONLY ONE OF THE STORIES
THAT THEY FOLLOW.
>> RIGHT. SO THERE ARE THREESTORIES.
FIRST OF ALL, KIND OF THE HOOKAND THE THING THAT GOT ME
INTERESTED WAS WE WERE GOING TOFOCUS ON THIS COUNTY THAT HAS
SEGREGATED PROMS FOR SUCH ALONG TIME.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> INTO THE 21st CENTURY, ANDYOU'RE LIKE WOW, THAT'S CRAZY.
AND WE ACTUALLY, THEY RANTHIS STORY IN "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" MAGAZINE A FEW YEARSAGO ABOUT THE SEGREGATED
PROMS AND WE THOUGHT IT WASTHIS WEIRD ODDITY BUT WE
DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS SOMUCH OTHER STORY THAT WAS
GOING TO BE INVOLVED.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO OUR DIRECTOR GILLIAN WENTDOWN THERE TO PHOTOGRAPH AND
DOCUMENT THE INTEGRATION OFTHE PROM BECAUSE AFTER ALL
THAT PRESS THEY GOT, THEYSTARTED INTEGRATING THE PROMS
AND SO SHE WENT DOWN THERE TOFILM THAT.
AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGSHAPPENED WHILE SHE WAS DOWN
THERE, A YOUNG MAN GOT SHOT,HE WAS UNARMED.
HE WAS RUNNING AWAY ANDHE GOT SHOT.
>> Jon: THIS IS NOT APOLICE -- HE HAD GONE,
A GIRL HAD INVITED HIMOVER TO THE HOUSE.
>> IT WAS A BOOTY CALL,BASICALLY, I MEAN-- .
>> Jon: NOT THAT MOVIE THATYOU ARE THINKING OF.
A DIFFERENT ONE.
>> NOT TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT YOU KNOW, HE WASDOING WHAT --
>> Jon: YOUNG MEN DO.
>> YOUNG MEN AND YOUNGWOMEN DO.
>> Jon: YES.
>> THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEYWANT TO SEE EACH OTHER
SOMETIMES.>> Jon: YES.
AND HE WENT TO HANG OUT WITHTHIS GIRL.
AND HER-- HER GUARDIAN FOUNDOUT AND THREATENED THE GUY
AND THEY TRIED TO GET AWAY,AND HE SHOT THEM AS THEY
WERE RUNNING AWAY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND KILLED HIM.
>> YES. KILLED HIM.
>> Jon: AND IT JUST SHOWS, YOUKNOW,
AND I'MSO STRUCK BY THIS NOW.
BECAUSE THIS CONVERSATION ISEXPLODING IN THE COUNTRY.
AND I'M JUST STRUCK BY THEANGER AND DEFENSIVENESS ON
THE SIDE OF PEOPLE WHEN YOUSAY RACISM STILL EXISTS IN
AMERICA.
PEOPLE SAYS THAT'S CRAZY!
WHITE PEOPLE VOTED FOROBAMA.
IT ENDED.
>> YEAH, IT DIDN'T.
WELL, THE THING IS SOMERACISM IS VERY EASY TO
IDENTIFY, THE DONALDSTERLINGS OF THE WORLD,
THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE "N" WORDIN A MALICIOUS WAY, YOU KNOW,
IT IS EASY TO IDENTIFY CERTAINRACISM BUT A LOT OF RACISM IS
STRUCTURAL AND IN THECRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,
IT OFTEN PLAYS OUT INSENTENCING, IN WHO GETS CHARGED
FOR WHAT, IN HOW JURIESARE PICKED --
>> Jon: SURE.
>> ALL THESE THINGS THAT END UPDISCOUNTING THE VALUE OF
BLACK LIVES VERSUS OTHER LIVES.
>> Jon: AND WHO LIVES WHEREAND NEIGHBORHOODS.
>> YES ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: AND FROM YEARS PAST,HOW DO YOU GET PAST THE IDEA
THOUGH THAT SOMEHOW A WHITEPERSON SHOULD FEEL ANGRY AT
HAVING TO DISCUSS IT BECAUSETHAT SEEMS LIKE A REAL
ISSUE. YOU KNOW, I SAW MICHELLEOBAMA WENT TO TUSKEGEE --
>> Jon: YES.
>> SHE TALKED ABOUT THAT SHE HADFACED DISCRIMINATION IN HER
LIFE, AND GLENN BECK, WHO GODLOVE HIM, IS AN INCREDIBLY
SANE INDIVIDUAL -->> YES.
>> Jon: HE'S VERYANGRY,
PEOPLE VOTED FOR YOU, YOUHAVE NEVER SUFFERED.
CONSERVATIVES SUFFER.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IT'S, I DON'T UNDERSTANDTHE PART --
>> IT'S HARD BEING  A WHITE MALECONSERVATIVE IN
AMERICA.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I HAVEALWAYS HOPE THAT ONE OF THEM
COULD BECOME PRESIDENT ONE DAY.
>> YES, ONE DAY, ONEDAY. ONE DAY.
>> Jon: THEY SHALL.
>> THEY SHALL OVERCOME.
>> Jon: I HOPE SO.
IF WE WORK TOGETHER AS APEOPLE.
>> YES.
>> Jon: BUT I THINK -->> THE THING IS I THINK YOU
SAID THIS ON ONE OF YOURSHOWS, WE DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT RACISM ALL THE TIME.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IF IT WEREN'T HERE IF WEDIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT
EVERY DAY, WE WOULD LOVE FOR IT
NOT TO BE A SUBJECT OFCONVERSATION.
WE WOULD LOVE TO JUST LIVEOUR LIVES IN EQUALITY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL.
WE WOULD LOVE THAT. WE WOULDLOVE TO NOT HAVE TO KEEP
BRINGING THIS UP.
BUT IT'S KILLING OUR KIDS.
IT'S RESULTING IN SO MUCHPAIN AND SUFFERING FOR OUR
COMMUNITY SO WE HAVE TOBRING IT UP.
>> AND IT FEELS LIKE THEINABILITY TO DISCUSS IT IN A
NONDEFENSIVE MANNER MEANSTHAT SOLUTIONS ARE BURIED.
AND I'M STRUCK BY THAT, THATTHE SYSTEMS STAY IN PLACE.
IT REALLY DOES TAKE ACTION.>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T, PASSIVITY TOA SYSTEM, NOT SAYING LIKE,
NOT BEING ACTIVELY RACIST, I'MSAYING BEING PASSIVE ABOUT IT
PERPETUATES.
>> YES, BECAUSE THATSTRUCTURAL RACISM HAS ITS
OWN INERTIA AND FORUS TO CHANGE IT WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ACTIVE TOCOUNTERACT THAT INERTIA. YEAH.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NO, I AGREE.
THIS HAS BEEN A GREATCONVERSATION.
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THE TYPEOF CONVERSATION SOMEBODY
WOULD WRITE A SONGABOUT.
>> WHO KNOWS.
>> Jon: IF THERE SOMEBODYTHAT-- CAN TELL YOU
SOMETHING, I SAY THIS WITHALL DUE RESPECT, BECAUSE YOU
KNOW I LOVE YOU ANDI LOVE THE MUSIC.
>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU WRITING THAT SONGFOR YOUR WIFE REALLY [BLEEP].
EVERYBODY.
>> IT MADE MY LIFE BETTER.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ACARD, THERE'S NOT A GIFT THAT I
CAN GIVE THAT SOMEONE WOULD SAYLIKE --
>> JUST PUSH PLAY, MAN. JUSTPUSH PLAY.
>> Jon: OH THAT'S NICE. YOUNOW, THERE IS THIS SONG I ONCE
HEARD. NO, I THINK IT'S AMAZING.I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'M LOVING THE MUSIC, I'MLOVING ALL THE WAYS YOU ARE
BRANCHING OUT INTO THINGS.
IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. STOPIT.
>> IT'S A PLEASURE.
>> Jon: "SOUTHERN RITES," ITWILL APPEAR ON HBO MAY 18th.
