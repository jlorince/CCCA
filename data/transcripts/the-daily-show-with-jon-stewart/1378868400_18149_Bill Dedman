>> Jon: WHAT ISINCREDIBLE TO ME IS THIS
WOMAN IS SORT OF -- WAS ALIVING EMBODIMENT OF THIS
ERA OF AMERICAN DOMINANCE.
DO YOU KNOW A MAN CALLEDHORSE --
>> DUSTIN HOFFMAN?
>> Jon: YES.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLESTORY.
SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE TOGO TO EUROPE ON THE RETURN
TRIP OF THE TITANIC.
>> MY CO-AUTHOR IS HERCOUSIN, AND HE HAD SPOKEN
TO HER ON THE PHONE. HE WAS ALITTLE BETTER A REPORTER THAN I
HE LOOKED HER UP IN THEPHONE DIRECTORY.
THIS HAD NOT OCCURRED TOME.
BUT HE SPOKE TO HER OFFAND ON THE PHONE FOR NINE
YEARS.
AND SHE DESCRIBED HOW NO,WE COULDN'T GO ON THE
TITANIC.
OUR FATHER SHOWED WHERE WEWOULD BE SLEEPING, BUT IT

YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
APPARENTLY SHE WASINCREDIBLY LUCID AND SWEET
AS PIE.

SHE WAS AN ARTIST.
SHE PAINTED.
THE MAN AND WOMAN WHOFIXED HER DOLL HOUSES AND
DID THE CURTAINS FOR THEMWERE PESTERED TO DEATH BY
HER.
SHE WOULD CALL EVERYEVENING AND SAY THE
CEILINGS WERE TOO LOW INTHE DOLL HOUSES AND SHE
TOLD THEM THE LITTLEPEOPLE ARE BANGING THEIR
HEADS.

ALL OF THE GRANDCHILDRENOF THE COUPLE WHO MADE HER
DOLL HOUSES WENT TOCOLLEGE ON HER GENEROSITY.
>> Jon: I ALWAYS THOUGHTTHAT DOLL HOUSE
CONSTRUCTION WAS RUN BYTHE MOB.
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS ABIG BUSINESS.
ONE OF THE DARK TURNS INTHE BOOK IS THE WAY THAT
THE HOSPITALS THAT SHESTAYED AT TRIED OVERTLY
AND EXPLICITLY AND WITH APAPER TRAIL TO GET MONEY
FROM HER.
>> THEY DESCRIBED HER INTHEIR E-MAILS AS THE
BIGGEST BUCKS CONTRIBUTINGPOTENTIAL WE EVER HAD.
THE HOSPITAL PRESIDENT --THIS HAS PROBABLY BEEN
YOUR EXPERIENCE WHENYOU'VE BEEN IN THE
HOSPITAL -- THE HOSPITALPRESIDENT VISITED HER
FREQUENTLY, AND HIS MOTHERCAME TO VISIT TO WATCH
CARTOONS WITH HER ON TV.
SHE LIKED THE JETSONS ANDFLINTSTONES, WHICH I
UNDERSTAND, BUT THESMURFS, I CAN'T QUITE
CONNECT TO.

BOND WITH HER.
ULTIMATELY, THEY WEREGOING TO TEAR DOWN THE
BUILDING, AND THEPRESIDENT OF THE HOSPITAL
CAME TO HER AND SAID IFYOU WILL ONLY GIVE US
$125 MILLION, WE WON'THAVE TO SELL THIS
BUILDING.
SHE COULD HAVE AFFORDEDIT.
SHE HAD STOCK.
SHE COULD HAVE PAID THAT.
AND SHE TOLD THEM, THAT'SA LOT OF MONEY.
AND SHE ASKED FOR A COPYOF THEIR FINANCIAL
STATEMENT.
THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR$125 MILLION.
IN THE WILL -- THEY GOT APAINTING, A MANET PAINTING.
THREE AND A HALF MILLION.
BUT IN THE WILL, THEY MUSTHAVE BEEN DREADFULLY
DISAPPOINTED.
THEY GOT ONLY ONE OF HER300 MILLION.

E-MAIL FROM THE GUY WHOSAYS SHE GAVE US MONEY, BUT
IT WAS RELATIVELY MODEST.
