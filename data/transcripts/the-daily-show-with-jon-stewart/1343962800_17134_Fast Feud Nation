( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS-- WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY [BLEEP]
EYESIGHT.
LIKE I HAVE TO HOLD THINGS OUT TO HERE NOW.
COULD I HAVE AGED THAT MUCH SINCE LAST NIGHT?
NO.
ANYWAY, WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST, JESSICA BIEL.
SHE WILL BE ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
(APPLAUSE) THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE CATCALLS AT ME.
OH, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE,
ACTUALLY.
LISTEN, DID YOU, BY ANY CHANCE, GO OUT TO LUNCH YESTERDAY?
MAYBE YOU WERE FORRAGING AROUND FOR A LITTLE-- AND WHILE YOU WERE OUT LOOKING
FOR LUNCH, DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING PECULIAR?
>> HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FLOCKED TO CHICK-FIL-A RESTAURANTS NATIONWIDE YESTERDAY.
>> THOUSANDS, PERHAPS WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE FIGURES YET, MAYBE MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE WOUND UP LIKE THAT.
>> THE CROWDS WERE SO BIG AT SOME LOCATIONS THAT MANY RESTAURANTS RAN OUT OF CHICKEN.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD!
(LAUGHTER) RAN OUT OF CHICKEN!
THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO THAT THE MAYANS PROPHECIED.
AMERICA IS OUT OF CHICKEN!
IT'S THE CLUCK OP LIPS.
SO WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DROVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO CRY
OUT AS ONE ORGANISM, I FEEL LIKE A CHICKEN AND WITCH.
>> CROWDS FLOCKED TO CHICK-FIL-A RESTAURANTS AROUND THE NATION FOR A APPRECIATION DAY.
>> IT WAS ALL TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE COMPANY AFTER ITS PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT.
AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO STAND UP AND SAY I OPPOSE GAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO GET MARRIED.
THEN TO HEAD DOWN TO A CHICK-FIL-A, GRAB AHOLD OF TWO BUTTERY BUNS, SPLIT THEM
OPEN AND GOBBLE DOWN SOME OF THAT HOT GREASEY COCK.
HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: JUST DIVING INTO THAT, ARE YOU JUST EATING THAT COCK.
HMMMM.
SPECIAL SAUCE ALL OVER YOUR FACE!
YOU DON'T WANT TO SWALLOW BUT YOU GOTS TO.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S SUCH GOOD COCK!
(LAUGHTER) HEY, MAN, CAN I GET A BAG OF COCKS TO TAKE BACK TO THE OFFICE?
GOD I LOVE CHICKEN SANDWICHES.
GOT ONE IN EACH HAND.
YOU'RE EATING THE OVER ONE-- OTHER ONE.
(LAUGHTER) IT JUST FEELS SO GOOD TO BE POLITICALLY ACTIVE.
IT'S A PROTEST, BABY, YEAH.
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING HERE.
FINALLY A FORM OF ACTIVISM AMERICANS CAN FULLY EMBRACE,
AFFECTING SOCIAL CHANGE THROUGH THE ACT OF EATING A FAST FOOD SANDWICH.
SAID GANDHI, [BLEEP] ME.
I HAD IT BACKWARDS.
(APPLAUSE) OH MAN.
