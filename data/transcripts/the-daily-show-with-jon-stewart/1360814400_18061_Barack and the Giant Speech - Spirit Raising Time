PEOPLE GOT NAUSEOUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LISTEN, BARACK OBAMA, YOU LAID
OUT THE TERRIBLE THINGS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE IT'S SPIRIT RAISING
TIME AND THE POWER OF WHAT WE
CAN ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER WITH THE
GOVERNMENT, THROUGH LAWS,
INITIATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE
ACTS.
>> NO LAWS, NO INITIATIVES, NO
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS WILL
PERFECTLY SOLVE ALL THE
CHALLENGES I'VE OUTLINED
TONIGHT.
BUT WE WERE NEVER SENT HERE TO
BE PERFECT.
>> Jon: YOU ARE (bleep)
KILLING ME.
YOU ARE KILLING ME!
NO ONE IS EXPECTING PERFECTION
JUST, YOU KNOW, EXPECTING THAT
THROUGH COORDINATING EFFORT WE
CAN LOWER THE UNSAFE BRIDGE
COUNT IN THIS COUNTRY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TO FOUR FIGURE TERRITORY.
9,000, 8,000.
I GET WE'RE NOT PERFECT.
HOW DO WE START?
>> EVERY DAY WE SHOULD ASK
OURSELVES THREE QUESTIONS AS A
NATION.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY.
STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE
BEFORE.
WHICH OF THE 70,000 BRIDGES ARE
NEAR MY HOUSE?
[LAUGHTER]
NUMBER TWO, ARE THE TUNNELS
OKAY?
[LAUGHTER]
AND NUMBER THREE, HOW DID HE
MEET THEIR MOTHER BECAUSE IF
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE IN A BAR OR
ON A J-DATE I'M GOING BE ANO, ID
BECAUSE I PUT EIGHT YEARS INTO
THIS (bleep).
IF THEY COME OUT WITH I WOKE UP
AND THERE SHE WAS, NO.
SO -- MY LIPS ARE JUST SO --
IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.
I'M SWEATING AND EATING
SALTINES.
YOU WOULD THINK AS A VETERAN OF
TELEVISION PRODUCTION I WOULD
KNOW, BUT I DON'T.
GOT NEWS FOR BARACK OBAMA IS
EVEN WITH THE SORRY STATE OF
AFFAIRS IN THIS COUNTRY -- OH,
WHAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A SHOW
HOSTED BY AN AGING FRENCH WHORE
BEFORE?
PRUDE, PRISSES, ALL OF YOU.
DON'T JUDGE ME.
I JUDGE YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHEN DOES THIS THING GO OFF THE
RAILS?
ANYONE KNOW?
[LAUGHTER]
THE GOOD NEWS FOR BARACK OBAMA
IS EVEN WITH THE SORRY STATE
AFTER FAIRS IN THIS COUNTRY HE'S
NOT GOING TO DO THE HEAVY
LIFTING BY HIMSELF.
HE HAS A SUPPORT OF HIS
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES AND
WHITMAN SAMPLERS OF AMERICAN
HEROS.
HEROS, OH, GOD YEAH, HEROS.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP ME
BECAUSE I'M STILL SO THIRSTY.
MY FAVORITE HERO WAS DESOLENE
VICTOR.
>> WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAM OF
A NORTH MIAMI WOMAN NAMED
DESOLENE VICTOR.
SHE WAS TOLD THE WAIT TO VOTE
MIGHT BE SIX HOURS.
SHE'S 102 YEARS OLD.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE MOST
ADORABLE WOMAN I'VE SEEN ON THE
PLANET.
SCREW THE CAT TOKEN THAT WOMAN
SHOULD BE THE THE NEW MONOPOLY
PIECE.
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.
ANYWAY --
[LAUGHTER]
LIQUID.
MMMMM, YES THE STATE OF THE
UNION ADDRESS IS A POWERFUL
BULLY PULPIT WHERE THE PRESIDENT THE
PRESIDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SHAPE HIS MESSAGE.
>> WE'VE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO
HAVE A FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE OUR
COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS.
THROUGHOUT, WE HAVE KEPT
CONGRESS FULLY INFORMED --
>> Jon: NO, CONGRESS HAS MADE
FORMAL REQUESTS FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS ON
DRONE STRIKES AT LEAST 18 TIMES
SINCE 2011.
THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING
THEY KEPT CONGRESS FULLY
INFORMED.
THAT'S LIKE FACEBOOK TELLING ME
HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT MY
PRIVACY.
REALLY, FACEBOOK, HOW COME MY
MOM WOUND UP SEEING THIS?
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH.
WHAT IT'S FOR AT THAT TOBACCO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I JUST USED IT FOR MARIJUANA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL HAS OUR
GOVERNMENT BECOME?
A FACE OF ALL THE LARGE SERIOUS
PROBLEMS LISTED BY THE PRESIDENT
OUR ABILITY TO ACT REMAINS SMALL
BORE.
>> LET'S AGREE RIGHT HERE RIGHT
NOW TO KEEP THE PEOPLE'S
GOVERNMENT OPEN AND PAY OUR
BILLS ON TIME.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY
THAT TO ADULTS.
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY
THAT TO ANYONE NOT COMING OUT OF
PRISON.
GUYS IF WE WON'T GET GET OUR
(bleep) TOGETHER, REPOE MAN IS
GOING TO TAKE FLORIDA.
LET'S DO THIS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
