(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST
TONIGHT IS A TERRIFIC ACTRESS,
STARRED IN MANY GREAT FILMS,
STARRING IN SHOW TIME'S NEW
ORIGINAL SERIES "THE BIG C."
>> COME GET YOUR TESTS.
>> YOU CAN'T BE FAT AND MEAN,
ANDREA.
>> WHAT?
>> YOU HEARD ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO DISH IT OUT,
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO LICK IT
UP.
FAT PEOPLE ARE JOLLY FOR A
REASON.
FAT REPELS PEOPLE, BUT JOY
ATTRACTS THEM.
NOW, I KNOW EVERYONE'S LAUGHING
AT YOUR CRUEL JOKES, BUT
NOBODY'S INVITING YOU TO THE
PROM.
SO YOU CAN EITHER BE FAT AND
JOLLY OR A SKINNY BITCH.
IT'S UP TO YOU.
SIT DOWN.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME LAURA
LINNEY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WHAT, THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THAT'S SOME SASSY
STUFF IN THERE.
>> IT'S FUN.
>> Jon: THIS IS... SO I GET
PEOPLE COME ON AND THEY HERE IN
A PROJECT AND I GET TO PITCH
WHAT'S THE PROJECT.
OH, A GREAT NEW COMEDY ON
SHOWTIME.
SHE HAS CANCER AND HER BROTHER
IS HOMELESS.
AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY, SOUNDS
FUNNY.
I CAN GO WITH THAT.
HOW DO THEY... HOW DO YOU
DELICATELY WEAVE THAT INTO A
PROGRAM LIKE THIS?
>> (LAUGHS)
WELL, WHEN IT FIRST CAME TO ME
IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
INTERESTED ME THE MOST BECAUSE I
THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE
IMPOSSIBLE.
YOU KNOW?
IT MIGHT NOT BE... THERE'S SORT
OF A RISKY THING TO DO AND I
DIDN'T KNOW IF HE COULD F WE
COULD PULL IT OFF TO DO A SHOW
WITH A COMIC CONTEXT ABOUT A
WOMAN WHO HAS STAGE FOUR
TERMINAL MELANOMA.
AND THE MORE I...
>> Jon: YOU HAD ME AT
"MELANOMA."
(LAUGHTER).
>> I HAD YOU AT MELANOMA.
(LAUGHS)
AND THEN THE MORE I SORT OF...
THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND
THOUGHT ABOUT TIME AND THE USE
OF TIME AND WHEN TIME IS RUNNING
OUT AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S
RUNNING OUT AND WITH FEAR AND
ANXIETY AND IF YOU'RE
THREATENED, FOR ME, ANYWAY, I
IMMEDIATELY GO TO HUMOR.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S A WAY TO
SURVIVE.
IT'S A WAY TO MAKE SENSE.
IT'S VERY MUCH SORT OF THE WAY
YOUR SHOW FUNCTIONS, ACTUALLY.
>> Jon: I WAS ABOUT TO SAY,
YOU'VE JUST MADE MY LIFE SEEM
SOMEWHAT HONORABLE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT NEVER REALLY OCCURRED TO
ME.
>> BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
THE VOICE OF COMEDY THAT
CLARIFIES THINGS.
YOU KNOW?
IT'S A LASER-LIKE SENSE OF
TRUTH-- IF IT'S TRUE, IF YOU
TOUCH TRUTH-- IT WILL INEVITABLY
BE SO EITHER REFRESHING OR
ASTOUNDING THAT PEOPLE WILL JUST
START TO LAUGH.
>> Jon: I MAKE A LOT OF POOP
JOKES.
(LAUGHTER).
>> YES.
WILL'S A LOT OF TRUTH IN SCAT.
>> Jon: HA THAT MAY BE THE
MOST ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION OF THE
USE OF COMEDY AS AN EXPRESSION
OF CATHARSIS OR FEELING THAT I
HAVE EVER HEARD AND I'M SUDDENLY
PROUD TO DO... BECAUSE I'M USED
TO... COMEDIANS, WE DO IT... YOU
KNOW, STRIPPERS AND THEN US.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IT'S A NIGHTCLUB BUSINESS SO
TO HEAR IT PUT THAT WAY IT MAKES
ME FEEL LIKE, YES, THAT'S WHY I
DIDN'T GO TO MED SCHOOL!
>> YOU ARE CULTURALLY NECESSARY.
>> Jon: VERY MUCH LIKE
WHITMAN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YOU ARE.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: GO ON.
(LAUGHTER)
NO, BUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
ALSO, YOU KNOW, E I FIND THAT IN
TERMS OF SUBJECT MATTER, PEOPLE
FORGET THAT IN THE DEPTHS OF
DESPAIR, COMEDY NEVER... PEOPLE
ALWAYS SAY "WHERE DO YOU DRAW
THE LINE?"
YOU SAY WELL... EVEN I'M SURE IN
THE HOLOCAUST PEOPLE IN THE
CAMPS WERE MAKING JOKES TO EACH
OTHER.
>> I'M SURE.
>> Jon: PEOPLE JOKE WHEN
THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE, WHEN
THEY'RE DIRE, IT'S A WAY OF
COPING.
>> IT'S A WAY OF DEALING WITH
TRUTH.
IT CAN BE SO OVERWHELMING.
IT'S LIKE THERE'S THAT FANTASTIC
GRAVESTONE THAT'S SOMEWHERE THAT
SAYS...
>> Jon: YOU DON'T HEAR THAT A
LOT EITHER.
BUT IT SAYS "I TOLD YOU I WAS
SICK."
THAT WAS THE GUY'S GRAVESTONE "I
TOLD YOU I WAS SICK."
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: ALONG THOSE LINES WHEN
MY GRANDFATHER, BEFORE HE PASSED
AWAY, THERE'S A CEMETERY AND WE
HAD HIS PLOT LAID OUT NEXT TO MY
GRANDMOTHER, APPARENTLY THEY
ENJOYED BEING TOGETHER.
AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT SHE
SHOULD BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE
BECAUSE JUST TO THE LEFT A
DOCTOR WAS BURIED.
AND HE WANTED VERY MUCH TO BE
BURIED NEXT TO A DOCTOR JUST IN
CASE HE NEEDED ANYTHING.
(LAUGHTER).
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.
THAT.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD
SAY ALL THE TIME.
"PUT HER ON THE RIGHT, I'LL GO
ON THE LEFT BY THE DOCTOR."
(LAUGHTER)
HAVE YOU MET PEOPLE NOW WHO HAVE
CANCER WHO SAY BOY, THIS IS SUCH
A REFRESHING RELIEF FOR ME?
SUCH A A CATHARSIS.
THAT'S GOT TO BE GRATIFYING.
>> IT'S VERY, VERY GRATIFYING
AND SOMETHING WE WERE ALL
HOPEFUL WOULD HAPPEN.
IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE IF IT
WAS THE OPPOSITE.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T CONTROL...
IF SOME WAYS YOU CAN'T CONTROL
THAT BECAUSE ALL YOU CAN DO IS
PUT IT THROUGHOUT WITH A LITTLE
INTEGRITY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
>> YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN AND
WE HAVE A FANTASTIC GROUP OF
PEOPLE AND WE'VE HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME WITH IT AND SO FAR
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE RESPONDING
POSITIVELY TO IT AND LAUGHING.
SO THAT'S GOOD.
>> Jon: WELL, IT'S "THE BIG
C," ON THE SAME NETWORK AS "THE
L WORD.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY "THE BIG C"
NOW.
IT WAS ORIGINALLY "THE C WORD"
AND BECAUSE OF THE "L" PROBLEM
WE WENT TO "THE BIG C".
>> Jon: YEAH.
OKAY.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
VERY, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> LOVELY TO MEET YOU AS WELL.
>> Jon: "THE BIG C" PREMIERS
ON SHOW TIME AUGUST 16 AT
