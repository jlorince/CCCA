>> Jon: LIKE THAT, IF HE HAD SAID THAT...
[LAUGHTER]
IF ONLY THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID "TRAGIC EVENT." WELL, OPPORTUNITY MISSED.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL SOUND BITE, YOU MAY VIEW THE RIGHT'S GRAND MAL MULTIMEDIA FREAKOUT AS AN
OVERREACTION, AN INEXPLICABLE ERUPTION RESULTING FROM AN INNOCUOUS STIMULUS, MUCH IN THE WAY IF YOU WERE TO SEE, SAY, AN
AGING JEWISH TALK SHOW HOST RUN TO THE BATHROOM AFTER DRINKING NEARLY HALF A GLASS OF MILK, YOU MIGHT THINK TO YOURSELF,
[BLEEPED] MILK.
TO YOU.
BUT IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT THE RIGHT OVER TIME HAS DEVELOPED "BARACKTOSE" INTOLERANCE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE IT BEGAN IN 2008.
>> WHO IS THE REAL BARACK OBAMA?
>> OBAMA IS A BIG RISK.
>> WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OBAMA.
>> WHAT DOES HE PLAN FOR AMERICA?
>> YOU KNOW, OLD BEN KENOBIE ASKS A REASONABLE QUESTION, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ANSWER CAN ONLY BE FOUND ON BULL [BLEEPED]
MOUNTAIN.
A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY... WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST FOX NEWS HEADQUARTERS RIGHT ON SIXTH AVENUE.
IT'S NOT THAT FAR.
2008, BARACK OBAMA WAS A NEW HOPE.
THE EMPIRE WAS UNEASY.
>> MR. OBAMA SHOULD BECOME PRESIDENT, I RALLY BELIEVE IT WILL BE HARD TO STOP THE ECONOMY FROM BEING SOCIALIZED.
>> THE AL QAEDA AND THE RADICALISTS AN THEIR SUPPORTERS WILL BE DANCING IN THE STREETS.
>> I'LL BET THAT THIS MARKET DROPS SIGNIFICANTLY.
>> HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR RUSH LIMBAUGH AND SEAN HANNITY.
>> THE RIGHTS OF LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS WILL BE AT RISK.
>> BARACK OBAMA WANTS TO DEPOPULATE THE COUNTRYSIDE AND MAKE US RIDE AROUND ON BICYCLES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHILE THE ECONOMY IS NOT YET SOCIALIZED, ISLAMISTS BURN EFFIGIES OF OBAMA, THE STOCK MARKET DOUBLED, limbaugh AND
HANNITY blather ON, GUN RIGHTS HAVE EXPANDED AND CARS REMAIN LEGAL...
[LAUGHTER]
...THE POINT IS...
[APPLAUSE]
BUT AFTER OBAMA'S INAUGURATION, THERE WAS NO TIME TO REEVALUATE FAILED PREDICTIONS BECAUSE THE BULL [BLEEPED] HARVEST OF
OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY WOULD WAIT FOR NO MAN.
>> BARACK OBAMA MET WITH KING ABDULLAH.
AND WHAT DID HE DO?
HE BOWED.
>> FREE OBAMA PHONES.
FREE OBAMA MONEY.
>> WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION.
>> $200 MILLION A DAY ON THE INDIA TRIP.
>> WHY DOESN'T HE SHOW HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE?
>> WE'VE GOT ACORN, WE'VE GOT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION.
>> THE RAPPER COMMON.
>> GLOBAL APOLOGY TOUR.
>> DEATH PANEL.
>> THE OBAMA INDOCTRINATION.
>> OBAMA BRAND REPARATIONS.
>> OBAMA IS DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY.
>> THE MOSQUING OF AMERICA.
>> WE'RE ESTABLISHING LITERALLY A COMMAND CENTER FOR TERRORISM RIGHT AT THE 9/11 SITE.
>> Jon: LITERALLY.
IT IS A LITERAL COMMAND CENTER FOR TERRORISM THAT WE ESTABLISHED AT THE SITE OF 9/11.
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
BUT WE DID.
LITERALLY.
WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING, KILL OUR GRANDmas, BRAINWASH OUR CHILDREN, INSTITUTE SHIRA LAW, BANKRUPT THE CHILDREN WITH $200
MILLION A DAY TRAVEL HABITs?
SETTING ASIDE THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS, WHY WOULD THE PRESIDENT DO THESE THINGS?
>> THE PRESIDENT'S A COMMUNIST.
>> THIS GUY IS I BELIEVE A RACIST.
>> I THINK HE'S MARXIST.
>> HE'S A NATURAL SECULAR EUROPEAN SOCIALIST.
>> I THINK HE'S PRO ISLAMIST.
>> THAT'S MUBARAK OBAMA.
>> HUGO CHAVEZ OBAMA.
>> CASTRO.
>> LENIN OR MUSSOLINI.
>> HITLER.
>> HITLER.
>> JOSEPH STALIN WITHOUT THE BLOODSHED.
>> Jon: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, JOSEPH STALIN WITHOUT THE BLOODSHED REALLY NOT THE SAME STALIN.
I MEAN, THE BLOODSHED WAS HIS THING.
WITHOUT THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL JUST BE, I DON'T KNOW, GARY STALIN.
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S JUST LIKE SCOOBY DOO BUT HE CAN'T TALK OR SOLVE CRIMES.
WELL, THEN HE'S JUST A [BLEEPED]
DOG WITH A SNACK HABIT.
THE WORST THING ABOUT LIVING ON BULL [BLEEPED] MOUNTAIN, FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE LONELY HNS.
>> HERE'S SOME NEWS YOU WON'T HEAR IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LIBERAL MAIN STREET MEDIA.
>> THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A STORY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSES TO COVER.
>> WHY HAS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA BARELY COVERED THAT STORY.
>> Jon: UH, BECAUSE IT'S BULL
[BLEEPED].
THIS IS WHAT BRINGS US BACK TO NOT OPTIMAL.
THIS IS WHAT BRINGS US BACK TO NOT OPTIMAL AND HOW BULL
[BLEEPED] MOUNTAIN WORKS ITS MAGIC.
AS PREDICTABLE AND HYPERBOLIC THE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE, FOR SOME REASON OTHER NETWORKS CAN'T RESIST ITS SIGH REMEMBER SONG.
>> THE "IT'S NOT OPTIMAL" LINE MAKING WAVES.
>> SOME CONSERVATIVES MAKING HAY OF THE OPTIMAL COMMENT.
>> MAKING THE ROUNDS OUT OF THE COMMENT.
>> "NOT OPTIMAL" SOUNDS WEEK.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE THING ABOUT BULL [BLEEPED] MOUNTAIN.
YOU MAY NOT LIVE ON IT, BUT WHENEVER IT RAINS, YOU GET THE MUDSLIDE.
WE'LL BE R
