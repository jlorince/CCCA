WELCOME BACK!
EVEN LONG AFTER THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS CELEBRATED SUNDAY'S
BRING THE BRONCOS TO WORK DAY, ONE SUPER BOWL CONTROVERSY RAGES
ON.
>> COCA-COLA, THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF CRITICISM.
>> COKE COMMERCIAL ALSO SPARKED CONTROVERSY.
>> POSSIBLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL SUPER BOWL AD.
THERE WAS A BOYCOTT COKE HASH TAG TRENDING LAST NIGHT ON
TWITTER.
>> ON THE INTERNET, THERE'S A LOT OF BACKLASH.
>> WHAT HAPPENED?  DID JANET JACKSON OPEN A COKE
CAN WITH HER TEET?  IF SHE COULD, I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE THAT.  WHAT TOXIC SMUT DID COCA-COLA
AIR TO SO BUNCH AMERICA'S UNDERGARMENTS?
♪ FOR SPACIOUS SKIES ♪
♪♪♪
♪THAT UPSET PEOPLE?
WERE THEY BOTHERED BY THE DANGEROUS LEVELS OF SHMALTZ?
I WILL GRANT YOU IF THERE WERE APRECIOUS MOMENTS FIGURINE WHERE
AN ORPHAN HANDED A PUPPY TO A KINDLY SOLDIER TITLED I WUV
AMERICA, IT WOULD BE LESS SAPPY THAN THAT AD.
BUT I'M GUESSING THAT WASN'T THEISSUE.
>> THE AD FEATURED PEOPLE FROM MANY ETHNICITIES, ONE TWEETED
I'LL NEVER BUY COKE AGAIN.
>> COCA-COLA LOST ITS MIND, OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IN OTHER
LANGUAGES, THAT IS UN-AMERICAN AS POSSIBLE.
>> YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING MOREDELICIOUS THAN A TALL COOL GLASSOF
COCA-COLA IS THE IRONY THAT THE SELF APPOINTED PATRIOTIC
AMERICAN WATCH DOGS SEEM UNAWARETHAT OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS IN
FACT NOT AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL. REALLY, PEOPLE?
THIS IS THE SUPER BOWL AD YOU'REGOING TO GET UPSET ABOUT WHEN
YOU HAD SOME SORT OF GREEK YOGURT SEX GAME GOING ON OR A
SPOT CELEBRATING THE UNNATURAL LOVE BETWEEN A DOG AND A HORSE?
THERE WAS AN AD WHERE A MAN'S HEAD WAS CRACKED OPEN.
OH, MY GOD!  OH, MY GOD!
IT REVEALED HIS SMALLER OTHER GREEN HEAD APPARENTLY TO THE
PURPOSE OF SELLING SOME KIND OF NUT.
I CAN'T RECALL THE SPECIFIC TYPEOF NUT.
I RECALL ENJOYING THE AD THINKING IT WAS VERY AMUSING.
I CAN'T RECALL THE TYPE OF NUTHE  WAS SELLING.
OF COURSE, THE NOW INFAMOUS HALFTIME AD FOR TURBOTAX.
WHAT IS THAT?  WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH
TAX RETURNS?  I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THOSE
PEOPLE ARE EVEN ACCOUNTANTS.  SO CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM WITHA GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE IMMIGRANTS
SINGING A BELOVED AMERICAN SONG IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGES?
>> I THINK BIGGEST ISSUE HERE IS, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
UNFORTUNATELY ARE COMING TO AMERICA NOW, NOT ASSIMILATING.
>> ASSIMILATING?  THEY'RE SINGING AMERICA THE
BEAUTIFUL WHILE DRINKING COCA-COLA.
HOW MUCH MORE AMERICAN ASSIMILATION CAN THEY HAVE?
MAYBE IF THEY WERE OPEN CARRYINGA GUN SHAPED LIKE JESUS WHILE
LOSING A BALD EAGLE STRAPPED ON [BLEEP] APPLE PIE.
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE, WHAT ELSE?  YOU KNOW, ALL THESE SELF
APPOINTED PATRIOTS WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT
NATIONALITIES IN THAT AD HAD ANCESTORS WHO CAMEFROM DIFFERENTNATIONS THEMSELVES,
EUROPE MOSTLY, MOST EARLY EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS CLUNG TO
NATIVE TONGUES LONGER THAN WASCOMFORTABLE FOR THE XENOPHOBESOF
THEIR TIME.  THIS WILL REFRESH YOUR MEMORY
♪-OH BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUSSKIES  ♪ FOREIGN LANGUAGE

♪ AMERICA ♪ AND CROWN THY GOOD
♪ WITH BROTHERHOOD ♪
