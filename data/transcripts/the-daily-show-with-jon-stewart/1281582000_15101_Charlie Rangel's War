SHOW.
CONGRESS IS, AS YOU KNOW, ON
RECESS ALL MONTH.
SO, SO NEEDED.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YESTERDAY IT RECONVENED FOR
A SPECIAL EMERGENCY SESSION.
IT'S AMAZING.
THEY CAME BACK FOR A DAY DURING
THEIR SUMMER BREAK.
WHY?
>> WE'RE HERE TODAY TO EXTEND A
LIFELINE TO TEACHERS AND
CLASSROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> OUR LEGISLATION WILL SAVE OR
CREATE MORE THAN 310,000
AMERICAN JOBS.
>> SPECIFICALLY FOR TEACHERS,
POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS,
AND NURSES.
>> IF THIS IS AN EMERGENCY-- AND
I THINK IT IS-- TO HELP OUR
LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS OUT,
WHAT ABOUT ME?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WAIT.
WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
APPARENTLY REPRESENTATIVE
CHARLIE RANGEL, CURRENTLY UNDER
INVESTIGATION BY THE HOUSE
ETHICS COMMITTEE, FELT THAT AS
LONG AS HIS COLLEAGUES WERE
WORKING ON A VACATION DAY, THAT
MIGHT BE THE PERFECT TIME TO
GIVE A 31-MINUTE SPEECH ABOUT
HIS CURRENT ETHICS PROBLEMS.
>> I HAVE BEEN LOSING A LOT OF
SLEEP OVER THESE ALLEGATIONS.
>> Jon: REALLY?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU'VE BEEN LOSING SLEEP?
YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
RANGEL HAS ENOUGH SLEEP STORED
UP FROM NAPPING AT THE DOMINICAN
VILLA HE ALLEGEDLY FAILED TO PAY
TAXES ON.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS GUY IS LIKE
A SLEEP CAMEL.
HE STORES IT IN HIS OLD MAN
FRONT-BUTT.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK AT THAT THING.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL
TACTIC, COMMANDEERING THE HOUSE
FLOOR LIKE THAT.
I GUESS SOMEONE TOLD RANGEL IT
WAS A GOOD IDEA.
>> WHY DID I TAKE THE FLOOR
TODAY?
I HAVEN'T FOUND ONE LAWYER THAT
SAID I SHOULD DO IT.
I HAVEN'T EVEN FOUND ONE FRIEND
THAT SAYS I SHOULD DO IT
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: (AS CHARMLY RANGEL)
THE CAB DRIVER ON THE WAY OVER
HERE SAID IT WAS POLITICALLY
INADVISABLE.
MY DOG THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE
IDEA.
I HAVE A MAGIC 8-BALL SAID
"SIGNS POINT TO NO."
SO I SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW IT!
I'LL DO IT!
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, FAIR
ENOUGH.
SERIOUS CHARGES AGAINST RANGEL,
I'M SURE HE'S NOT GOING TO ROLL
THE DICE LIKE IF THIS IF HE DID
NOT HAVE A CLEAR AND CONCISE
EXPLANATION.
FOR INSTANCE, WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH THE DOMINICAN VILLA?
>> WHEN ACCUSATIONS WERE MADE, I
HIRED A FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT AND
TOLD THEM TO CHECK OUT WHAT THE
HECK IS GOING ON, THAT IF YOU'D
DONE THE RIGHT THING YOU HAD NO
LIABILITY BECAUSE THE TAXES THAT
WERE PAID TO THE DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC WOULD HAVE BEEN
DEDUCTED WITH DEPRECIATION I
WOULD HAVE NO LIABILITY.
IT WASN'T AS THOUGH SOMEONE
TRACKED ME DOWN, THE I.R.S. OR
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE.
I FILED THE CORRECT PAPERS.
HAVING SAID THAT, IS THAT AN
EXCUSE THAT'S WORTHY?
OF COURSE NOT!
>> Jon: WHAT?
NO, YOU HIRED AN ACCOUNTANT!
(LAUGHTER)
WHO SAID DOMINICAN VILLAS ARE
TAX-FREE!
(LAUGHTER)
YES, THAT REALLY ISN'T A WORTHY
EXCUSE.
(AS CHARLIE RANGEL)
DID I DRIVE MY MOTOR BOAT INTO A
MAN ON WATER SKIS?
OF COURSE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I HIRED A DOCTOR WHO TOLD ME
HE DIED FROM DROWNING SO I...
(LAUGHTER).
... DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
ABOUT THE ACCUSATION THAT YOU
USED ONE OF YOUR FOUR
RENT-STABILIZED APARTMENTS FOR
BUSINESS PURPOSES?
>> NO ONE SAID THAT THE
APARTMENT THAT THEY CONSIDERED
TO HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED
ONE.
AS YOUR COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND WAS
NOT SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT
THERE WAS APPEARANCES, THOUGH, I
WAS BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY
THAN ANY ONE ELSE.
BUT THE LANDLORD SAID HE DIDN'T
TREAT ME ANY DIFFERENTLY.
NO ONE SAID THAT THEY DID TREAT
ME DIFFERENTLY.
AND SO THAT ENDS THE APARTMENT
THING.
BUT I LEAD GUILTY OF NOT BEING
SENSITIVE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: HE PLEADS GUILTY OF
NOT BEING SENSITIVE.
WE'RE NOT ACCUSING YOU OF NOT
CUDDLING WITH YOUR
RENT-STABILIZED APARTMENTS.
YOU'RE ACCUSED OF EXPLOITING
REPRESENT-STABILIZED APARTMENTS.
ARE THERE ALSO ALLEGATIONS ABOUT
USING CONGRESSIONAL LETTERHEAD
FOR RAISING MONEY WITH A
UNIVERSITY BUILDING WITH YOUR
NAME ON IT AND HELP THE YOU WERE
PROMISE AN OFFICE WITH THE SAME
BUILDING?
>> THE HASTE OF SENDING OUT
HUNDREDS OF LETTERS, NEVER
ASKING FOR A PENNY, THERE HAS TO
BE A PENALTY FOR GRABBING THE
WRONG STATIONERY AND NOT REALLY
DOING THE RIGHT THING.
THIS IS A BROKEN-DOWN BUILDING.
I MEAN, WHO IN THE HECK NEEDS AN
OFFICE WITH 40 YEARS OF SERVICE
IN THE CONGRESS IN A BROKEN-DOWN
BUILDING?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: OKAY, THIS ONE I
UNDERSTAND, ACTUALLY.
YOU INCOMPETENTLY EXERTED YOUR
INFLUENCE IN EXCHANGE FOR A
BENEFIT YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT?
(AS CHARLIE RANGEL)
I MEAN, SURE, THERE MAY HAVE
BEEN A QUID PRO QUO BUT THE QUID
WAS ACCIDENTAL AND THE QUO WAS
[NO AUDIO]
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: WELL, I GUESS THE
DEFENSE RESTS BUT BEFORE THE
DEFENSE REST IT HAS ONE LAST
INCREDIBLY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE
MESSAGE.
>> I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FEEL
EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD.
HEY, IF I WAS YOU, I MAY WANT
KNOW GO AWAY, TOO.
I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THE
UNFAIRNESS OF THIS IS TO ME.
I DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
I'M THINKING ABOUT ALL OF YOU.
SUPPOSE I DO GET EMOTIONAL?
SUPPOSE I DO THINK OF MY LIFE,
THE BEGINNING AND THE END?
I'M 80 YEARS OLD, I DON'T WANT
TO DIE BEFORE THE HEARING.
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE, JUST DON'T
BELIEVE THAT I DON'T HAVE
FEELINGS, THAT I DON'T HAVE
PRIDE.
I MEAN, DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I NEVER THOUGHT IN MY
LIFE THAT I WOULD SEE THE GUY
WHO SERVED IN HARLEM FOR 40
YEARS AS A CONGRESSMAN MORPH
INTO AN OLD JEWISH MAN.
(LAUGHTER)
BEFORE MY VERY EYES.
(AS OLD JEWISH MAN)
I DON'T... I MEAN... I DON'T
CARE WHAT YOU DO.
I'M GOING TO DIE SOON.
(LAUGHTER)
THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW WILL
YOU LIVE WITH
