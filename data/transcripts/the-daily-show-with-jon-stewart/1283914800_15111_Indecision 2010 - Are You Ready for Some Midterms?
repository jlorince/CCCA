[LAUGHTER]
BUT FIRST, IT'S SEPTEMBER KIDS.
FALL JUST AROUND THE CORNER, A
CERTAIN CHRISTMAS IN THE AREA.
THAT WILL ONLY MEAN ONE THING.
â™ª ARE YOU READY FOR SOME
MID-TERMS?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, I BROKE
THE GLASS!
ON THE -- SOMETHING.
[LAUGHTER]
THE 2010 BATTLE FOR THE POTOMAC.
TWO PARTIES ENTER, ONE PARTY
LEAVES WITH A SLIGHT LEGISLATIVE
MAJORITY ALLOWING THAT PARTY TO
FINALLY OBSTRUCT OR BEING
OBSTRUCTED FROM CARRYING OUT ANY
MEANINGFUL SOCIAL CHANGE.
HALF LAUGH OF COURSE, THE
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS THE
DEMOCRATS HAD A GREAT 2008
SEASON, UNFEE FEED IN THE HOUSE.
HOW ARE THEY LOOKING THIS YEAR
IN LET'S GO TO THE ANALYSTS.
>> DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO GET
CRUSHED.
>> GOING TO GET CLOBBERED.
>> GOING TO KICK BUTT.
>> DEMOCRATS MAY BE CRUISING
TOWARD A NOVEMBER BRUISING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SORRY WHAT WAS THAT
LAST ONE THERE?
CRUISING TOWARDS A BRUISING?
I THINK YOU MAY BE CONFUSING THE
MID-TERM DEMOCRATS WITH KINICKI
FROM GREASE.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN WHO COULD
TURN A POSSIBLE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
EXTENSION EVENT INTO A MERE
ELECTORAL LANDSLIDE, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
BUT IS HE WILLING TO ROLE UP HIS
SLEEVES?
HE IS WILLING TO ROLE UP HIS
SLEEVES.
YESTERDAY HE CAME OUT TO GIVE
HIS VERSION OF A ROUSING MORALE
BOOSTER.
WOULD HE GO COAST TAYLOR QUIET
AND INSPIRATIONAL.
>> LET'S HEAR IT ONE MORE TIME
TOGETHER.
CLEAR EYES FULL HEART!
LET'S GO!
>> Jon: CLEAR EYES, FULL
HEART.
OR WITH DEMOCRATIC DISASTER
WOULD OBAMA GIVE IT THE FULL
LOGGIA.
>> GO OUT THERE AND (bleep)
AND (bleep) DOWN THEIR NECKS!
>> Jon: NOW, NOW, NOW --
[LAUGHTER]
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW TEARING OFF
THEIR HEADS WOULD GIVE YOU A
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT (bleep) DOWN THEIR NECKS?
THAT'S JUST POOR SPORTSMANSHIP.
WHICH WAY WOULD BARACK OBAMA GO?
>> TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING A NEW
PLAN FOR REBUILDING AND
MODERNIZING AMERICA'S ROADS AND
RAILS AND RUNWAYS FOR THE
LONG-TERM.
I WANT AMERICA TO HAVE THE BEST
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE WORLD!
>> Jon: OH, (bleep) NO HE
DIDN'T!
NO!
HE WENT $50 BILLION
INFRASTRUCTURE OPRAH ANGLE
NETWORK ON THEIR -- ANGEL
NETWORK ON THEIR ASS.
YOU GET A HYDRO ELECTRIC DAM!
YOU GET AN INTERCHANGE THAT HAD
THREE LANES BUT WILL WIDEN TO
FOUR BUT SOMEHOW REMAIN JUST AS
CROWDED.
YES!
BILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE --
DIDN'T WE DO THIS ALREADY?
>> THROUGH THE RECOVERY ACT, WE
WILL BE INVESTING $28 BILLION IN
OUR HIGHWAYS, MONEY THAT EVERY
ONE OF OUR 50 STATES CAN START
USING IMMEDIATELY TO PUT PEOPLE
BACK TO WORK.
WHAT WE'RE DOING ONCE MORE BY
BUILDING A 21ST CENTURY
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL MAKE
AMERICA'S ECONOMY STRONGER AND
AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFER.
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF OUR
RECOVERY PLAN.
THAT IS THE CAUSE OF MY
PRESIDENCY.
>> Jon: NO, YEAH -- OKAY.
IT MAY BE THE CAUSE BUT I GUESS
WHAT WE'RE WONDERING IS, WHAT IS
THE EFFECT?
FOR ANOTHER $50 BILLION
SHOULDN'T WE HAVE LIKE A 22nd
CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE BY THIS
POINT WHERE THE BRIDGES AND
TUNNELS COMING AND -- COME AND
PICK US UP AT THE HOUSES.
LRNT IF POPE DON'T WORK WHAT
ABOUT REPARTY.
>> ALMOST EVERY REPUBLICAN IN
CONGRESS SAYS NO EVEN ON THINGS
WE USUALLY AGREE ON THEY SAY NO.
IF I SAID THE SKY WAS BLUE,
THEY'D SAY NO.
IF I SAID FISH LIVE IN THE SEA,
THEY'D SAY NO.
>> Jon: TO BE FAIR THEY ARE
NOT BEING OBSTRUCTIONISTS THEY
ARE JUST --
[LAUGHTER]
THE DEMS HAVE MORE THAN
POLICIES, MORE THAN PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S MORALE SPEECHES, THEY
HAVE AN ELECTORAL STRATEGY THAT
IS GOING TO KNOCK THE
REPUBLICANS SOCKS OFF.
>> THEY ARE GOING TO DO WHAT IS
CALLED TRIAGE.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE FROM THE
ACCIDENT BROUGHT INTO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM THEY ARE DOING
PRIORITIES.
>> THEY ARE NOT PUTTING MONEY IN
ESSENTIALLY LOST CAUSES.
>> THEY THEY HAVE TO MAKE A CLEAR
EYED ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IS
WINNABLE AND NOT WINNABLE.
>> Jon: THEY HAVE TO MAKE
TOUGH CALLS TO MAKE A PANEL TO
PULL THE PLUG ON CANDIDATES --
OH, MY GOD -- THE DEATH PANELS
ARE REAL!
OOOOOOOH!
AND THEY ARE USING THEM ON
THEMSELVES.
[LAUGHTER]
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!
OR THE SENATE!
BUT THE -- THAT WAS SOMEWHAT
SPOOKY.
BUT THE DEMOCRATS' PROBLEM ISN'T
THEIR IDEAS OR THEIR DESPERATE
STRATEGY IT'S REALLY THAT NO
MATTER WHAT THEY DO IT DOESN'T
(bleep) MATTER.
CASE IN POINT, ARIZONA, WHERE
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR MET HER
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT FOR A
DEBATE.
LET'S WATCH HER OPENING
STATEMENT.
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR WATCHING US
TONIGHT.
I HAVE, AH -- DONE SO MUCH AND I
CANNOT BELIEVE WE HAVE CHANGED
EVERYTHING SINCE I'VE BECOME
YOUR GOVERNOR IN THE LAST 600
DAYS.
ARIZONA HAHS BEEN BROUGHT BACK
FROM ITS ABYSS.
WE'VE CUT THE BUDGET.
WE'VE BALANCED THE BUDGET AND WE
ARE MOVING FORWARD.
WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE
COULD POSSIBLY DO.
[LAUGHTER]
WE HAVE, UM, -- DID WHAT WAS
RIGHT FOR ARIZONA.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HEY, GOVERNOR BREWER,
MISS TEEN SOUTH CAROLINA CALLED,
SHE WANTS HER U.S. AMERICANS AND
THE IRAQ PERFORMANCE STYLE BACK.
[LAUGHTER]
DID AN MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL SNEAK
ACROSS THE BORDER AND GRAB YOUR
TONGUE.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
HER BRAIN FART LASTED THE SAME
AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES THE TIME
FROM QUANTUM LEAP TO REALIZE HE
IS IN A NEW BODY.
LET'S GO TO THE TAPE AND SEE IT.
>> WHERE AM I?
MY NOTEPAD SAYS GOVERNOR OF
ARIZONA.
I'M THE GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA?
>> WE HAVE -- UM --
>> SAY SOMETHING.
>> -- DID WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR
ARIZONA.
>> Jon: KNEW IT.
FOLLOWING THE DEBATE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- GOVERNOR BREWER -- FOLLOWING
THE DEBATE GOVERNOR BREWER SAID
SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE
PARTICIPATING IN THESE DEBATES.
CAN I ONLY ASSUME BECAUSE THEY
ARE A CHARADE AND GIVE NO TRUE
SENSE OF A CANDIDATE.
SHE'S PROBABLY BETTER ONE ON ONE
WITH REPORTERS LIKE RIGHT AFTER
THE DEBATE WHICH THEY QUESTIONED
HER ABOUT HER EVIDENCELESS CLAIM
THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE
LEAVING DECAPTIATED BODIES IN
THE ARIZONA TKEZ YORT.
>> Jon: ANSWER THE QUESTION.
>> DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT?
COME ON, GOVERNOR?
>> THANK YOU, ALL.
>> GOVERNOR --
>> Jon: AAWWW.
PWETTY PWEASE.
I WONDER WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE HEADLESS BODIES.
>> YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU TEAR
THINK (bleep) HEAD OFF AND YOU
(bleep) DOWN THEIR NECKS.
>> Jon: WHY DO I BRING UP THE
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR'S DISASTROUS
DEBATE APPEARANCE AND IGNORING
QUESTIONS ABOUT (bleep)
STATEMENTS SHE BROUGHT UP IN THE
FIRST PLACE AS EVIDENCE OF
DIFFICULTIES DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATES ARE FACING.
HERE IS JANUARY BREWER'S
OPPONENT AND A WEEK AFTER THE
DEBATE SHE'S CRUSHING THE
(bleep) OUT OF HIM.
