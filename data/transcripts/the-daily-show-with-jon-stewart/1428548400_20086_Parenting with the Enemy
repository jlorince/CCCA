BY THE WAY, UNDERREPORTING ANDBAD MEDIA ARE ONLY TWO OF
THE MANY SYSTEMIC ISSUESTHAT AMERICA'S RAPE VICTIMS
HAVE TO CONTEND WITH.
SAMANTHA BEE FILES THISREPORT.
>> AMERICA FACES A LITANY OFCOMPLEX PROBLEMS THAT WE
CAN'T AGREE ON HOW TO FIX.
OUR CRUMBABLINGINFRASTRUCTURE, SIMPLIFYING
OUR BLOATED TAX CODE, ISSCIENCE EVEN REAL?
HARD STUFF.
BUT CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIEWASSERMAN-SCHULTZ THINKS SHE
HAS AN ISSUE THAT NO ONE CANDISAGREE WITH.
>> RIGHT NOW A WOMAN DOESN'THAVE THE RIGHT ACROSS
AMERICA TO TERMINATE HERRAPIST'S PARENTAL RIGHTS.
>> NO, THAT IS NOT TRUE.
>> IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OFRAPE AND YOU CONCEIVE A
CHILD, THEN YOU SHOULD BEABLE TO TERMINATE YOUR
RAPIST'S PARENTAL RIGHTS.
>> SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUTCUSTODY, TALKING ABOUT
VISITATION.
>> YES.
>> EVERY OTHER WEEKEND YOUHAVE TO MEET YOUR RAPIST IN
A DENNY'S PARKING LOT AND HANDOVER YOUR CHILD.
>> EXACTLY. RIGHT.
>> THIS CANNOT BE REAL.
NO, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN,NO, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE
THAT.
>> I SPENT TWO YEARS OF MYOWN LIFE FIGHTING MY
ATTACKER FOR CUSTODY OF MYDAUGHTER.
AND IT'S WHAT PROMPTED ME TO GOTO LAW SCHOOL.
>> OKAY, SO THIS ACTUALLY ISA THING.
AND SHAUNA PREWITT HAS BEEN APUBLIC ADVOCATE TO END THIS
UN[BLEEP] BELIEVABLESITUATION.
>> WE KNOW THAT ABOUT 32,000WOMEN EACH YEAR BECOME
PREGNANT THROUGH RAPE.
AT LEAST A THIRD OF THEM GOON TO RAISE THAT CHILD.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW,AT LEAST 10,000 POTENTIAL
CUSTODY BATTLES EVERY SINGLEYEAR IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> OH, THAT'S VERYINTERESTING.
OKAY, EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND.
JUST BE RIGHT BACK.
(SCREAMING)
PREWITT'S NUMBERS WERE MAKING MYBRAIN EXPLODE.
I WAS GOING TO NEED A LITTLEHELP GETTING THROUGH THIS
STORY.
LUCKILY I WAS PREPARED FORJUST SUCH AN EMERGENCY.
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BABYCHICKENS.
THE GOOD NEWS ISWASSERMAN-SCHULTZ INTRODUCED
LEGISLATION TO FIX THIS.
>> WE DO HAVE BIPARTISANSUPPORT.
THIS BILL IS ENDORSED BYPRO-LIFE GROUPS AND
PRO-CHOICE GROUPS.
I EXPECTED THAT IF THERE WASANY ISSUE THAT WOULD SAIL
THROUGH WITHOUT A PROBLEM,THAT IT WOULD BE THIS ONE.
BUT THE BILL DIDN'T EVEN GETA HEARING.
>> OKAY, NO, NOPE.
>> THE PARENTAL RIGHTS --
>> IT'S GOINGTO BE OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
SO WHY DID THIS CAN'T FAILBILL FAIL?
>> THERE IS A SMALLPROVISION IN THE BILL THAT
ACTUALLY SPENDS SOME MONEY.
THE BILL DIDN'T MOVE OVERTHIS SMALL FUNDING ISSUE.
>> SMALL FUNDING, OKAY.
SO THIS IS A WEIRD QUESTION.
BUT HOW MUCH MONEY IS TOOMUCH MONEY TO STOP RAPISTS
FROM PURSUING THEIRCUSTODIAL RIGHTS.
>> WELL, LET ME SHARE THE WITHYOU.
THE BILL AUTHORIZED $5MILLION PER YEAR FOR FIVE
YEARS.
>> FOR [BLEEP] SAKE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEGOVERNMENT SPENDS ON
PROMOTING FRUITS ANDVEGETABLES ON SOCIAL MEDIA?
$5 MILLION A YEAR, #GETFRUVED.
SO WE'RE COOL WITH TEAM GRAPESBUT NOT TEAM HELPING
RAPE VICTIMS? GOT IT.
IN THE MEANTIMEWASSERMAN-SCHULTZ HAS
RE-INTRODUCED HERBILL AND THINKS THAT THIS TIME
IT MAY PASS.
>> IF IT PASSES THEN NOWOMAN WILL EVER HAVE TO FACE
THIS NIGHTMARE EVER AGAIN,PROBLEM SOLVED, RIGHT?
>> WELL, I WISH IT WERE THATSIMPLE.
BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC.
IT IS ACTUALLY UP TO THE STATES.
SO WHAT WE DO IN THE BILL IS WEINCENTIVIZE STATES THAT
DON'T HAVE THIS LAW INPLACE.
WE HAVE TO EITHER USE ACARROT OR A STICK.
IN THIS CASE WE CHOSE ACARROT.
>> I FEEL LIKE I WOULD HAVECHOSEN THE STICK.
>> I KNOW, THE STICK CAN BETEMPTING.
>> SO CONSTITUTIONALLY EACHSTATE HAS TO CHANGE ITS OWN
LAWS. QUICK QUESTION, WHYTHE [BLEEP] DO THE STATES
EVEN NEED AN INCENTIVE?
>> I THINK THAT THE PROBLEMIS THAT IT GOES BACK TO THE
SUSPICION THAT LEGISLATORSHAVE OF RAPED WOMEN.
AND NOT ONLY THAT, SOMEWOMEN HAVE BEEN THREATENED
BY THEIR ATTACKERS WHO HAVESAID IF YOU STOP THE
CRIMINAL PROCESS AGAINST MEI WILL AGREE NOT TO SEEK ANY
CUSTODY OF PARENTAL RIGHTS.
>> I'M JUST GOING TO GO GET SOMEFRESH AIR.
THAT'S IT, I'M OUT.
I'M OUT OF SHOCK.
OKAY, JUST WALK AND THINK,THINK AND WALK, OKAY.
WHOOO.
NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSEBETWEEN DROPPING CHARGES OR
A CUSTODY BATTLE.
OH MY GOD.
OH MY GOD.
WHERE AM I?
OH, THIS IS PRETTY.
SO SNOWY.
NOT INFURIATINGLY SAD.
YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY WOULD ILEAVE?
I'LL JUST ENJOY MY TEA.
GROW A BEARD.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THE LACKOF SOUL-CRUSHING GOVERNMENT
DYSFUNCTION?
I COULD MAKE A NEW LIFE HERE.
>> SAM.
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?
>> IT'S HASAN MINHAJ FROM THEDAILY SHOW.
>> I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
>> YOU NEED TO FINISH THEPIECE.
>> I'M TO THE GOING BACK.
>> BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.
>> I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT.
GODDAMN IT.
>> THERE WAS STILL WORK TODO.
LISTEN, CAN I BORROW YOURRAZOR?
>> I LEFT THAT LADY SITTINGTHERE FOR A LONG TIME.
>> OKAY, HERE WE GO.
ARE THERE ANY STATES OUTTHERE DOING THE RIGHT THING
ON THEIR OWN?
>> FLORIDA NOT ONLY HAS ALAW, IT HAS A TERRIFIC LAW
THAT'S ACTUALLY A MODEL THAT IWOULD LIKE TO GET REPLICATED IN
A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES.
>> DID YOU JUST SAY FLORIDA?
>> YEAH.
>> I'VE BEEN DOING THIS JOBFOR A LONG TIME AND I HAVE
NEVER SAID THESE WORDSBEFORE.
GOOD JOB, FLORIDA!
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.
TIME FOR A GOODOLD-FASHIONED STATE-SHAMING.
>> HI.
IF YOUR STATE IS RED ON THISMAP, CALL YOUR LEGISLATOR
AND TELL THEM TO GET THEIR[BLEEP] TOGETHER.
DON'T LIKE MAPS? HERE ARE THEIRNAMES.
ALABAMA, ARIZONA, MARYLAND,MINNESOTA, I'M SO MAD!
THAT FELT BETTER.
AND WHILE WE'RE WAITING, IFYOU ARE LOOKING FOR ME, I'LL
