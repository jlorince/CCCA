MANHATTAN'S 21 CLUBFEATURING WISCONSIN GOVERNOR
SCOTT WALKER.
>> SAYING TO THE CROWD,QUOTE, I DO NOT BELIEVE AND
I KNOW THIS IS A HORRIBLE THINGTO SAY, BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT THE PRESIDENT LOVESAMERICA.
>> HERE'S WHAT IS CRAZY.
SPEAKING AT A PRIVATEREPUBLICAN DINNER, AT THE 21
CLUB, AND YOU HAVE TO WARNYOUR AUDIENCE THAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHINGHORRIBLE ABOUT PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S HOW BAD THIS WAS.
HORRIBLE OBAMA THINGS ARE WHATTHEY PAID MONEY TO COME
HERE.
THEY EVEN CALLED THE DINNERHORRIBLE [BLEEP] ABOUT OBAMA:
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITHSCOTT WALKER AND RUDY GIULIANI
AND YET YOU STILL HAD TO SAY,THIS IS TOO FAR FOR THAT.
SO CLEARLY, MR. MAYOR, YOUKNOW THE DRILL.
YOU WENT TOO FAR, REEL IT INAS BEST YOU CAN.
>> I'M NOT QUESTIONING HISPATRIOTISM.
HE'S A PATRIOT I'M SURE.
>> Jon: ACTUALLY THAT ISLITERALLY YOU WHAT DID.
THAT IS THE LITERALDEFINITION OF WHAT YOU DID.
PATRIOTISM IS LOVE OFCOUNTRY, UNLESS ARE YOU
QUESTIONING HIS ABILITY TOLOVE, PERIOD.
PERHAPS IF HE'S SOME TYPE OFROBOT SENT FROM THE FUTURE
TO DESTROY AMERICA BY GIVINGUS HEALTH CARE, I GUESS, I
DON'T KNOW.
IT'S PRETTY OFFENSIVE.
BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'SSTILL ROOM FOR WHAT YOU SAID
TO BE JUST A-- JUST A-- MOREOFFENSIVE, MR. MAYOR?
>> I AM AT A STAGE OF REAL,REAL WORRY FOR MY COUNTRY.
ISIS, ISIL, AL QAEDA, VERYDANGEROUS.
HORRIBLE PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMADIDN'T LIVE THROUGH
SEPTEMBER 11th.
I DID.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'TALMOST, YOU KNOW, HAVE A
BUILDING FALL ON HIM, MYSELFAND MY POLICE COMMISSIONER
AND MY FIRE COMMISSIONER DID.
>> Jon: SHUT UP!
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THEMAYOR OF 9/11, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T OWN 9/11.
YOU DON'T OWN ANYTHING BUTTHE UNIQUE WILLINGNESS TO
CRASSLY EXPLOIT IT.
HERE IS HOW FAR OUT IN THE DEEPEND GIULIANI WAS ON THIS.
>> MR. MAYOR, DO YOU WANT TOAPOLOGIZE FOR YOUR COMMENT?
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THEDIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOU,
BUT TO CONDEMN HIS PATRIOTISM TOQUESTION HIS LOVE OF AMERICA?
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'TLOVE AMERICA.
I MEAN, HE WAS RAISED IN PART BYHIS GRANDPARENTS,
HIS GRANDFATHER SERVEDIN WORLD WAR II.
>> Jon: HEY, BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW,WHO ELSE SERVED IN WORLD
WAR -- HITLER.
HE DIDN'T LOVE AMERICA.

NOW AFTER MEGYN'S.
>> IF YOU REALLY LOVESOMEBODY, LET'S JUST SAY
SOMEBODY, DO YOUFUNDAMENTALLY WANT TO
TRANSFORM THEM?
>> Jon: THANK YOU, SEAN.(LAUGHTER)
AH YES, THE OLD OBAMAFUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM
AMERICA COMMENT THATREPUBLICANS HAVE TAKEN OUT
OF CONTEXT SINCE 2008.
I SEE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.
THEIR REAL PROBLEM WITH OBAMAIS THAT HE LOVES AMERICA IN
SPITE OF ITS FLAWS, NOT BYIGNORING THEM.
BUT ISN'T THAT A MORE HONESTKIND OF LOVE?
I MEAN MR. MAYOR, IF I MAY,YOU USED TO ROCK THIS LOOK.
UNTIL SOMEONE WHO LOVED YOUSAID YOU NEED TO
FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM YOURCABEZA.
AND YOU LISTENED.
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD ASKYOUNGER GIULIANI WHAT HE
THINKS ABOUT CHANGING THINGSTHAT YOU PRESUMABLY LOVE,
LIKE 20 YEARS AGO OR SO.
>> DREAM WITH ME OF A CITYTHAT CAN BE BETTER THAN THE
WAY IT IS NOW.
I ASK YOU TO GIVE ME ACHANCE.
TO MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN FOR US.
DON'T LET THOSE WHO ARE SOFEARFUL OF TRANSFORMATION
STOP THE PROCESS BEFORE ITBEGINS.
