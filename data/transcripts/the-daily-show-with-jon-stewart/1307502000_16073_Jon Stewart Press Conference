>> HERE COMES JON STEWART NOW.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
I WANTED TO TAKE SOME TIME TO
CLEAR UP SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT MY
BEHAVIOR OVER THE PAST TEN DAYS
OR SO AND...
(LAUGHTER)
TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
MY ACTIONS.
I... I HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES
AND I HAVE HURT THOSE CLOSEST TO
ME.
(LAUGHTER)
LAST FRIDAY NIGHT A CONGRESSMAN
WHOSE NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH A
SEXUAL ORGAN...
(LAUGHTER).
SENT A PHOTO OF-- IT-- TO A
YOUNG WOMAN ON TWITTER.
IT WAS BY ANY STANDARDS A GIFT
FROM THE COMEDY... WHATEVER IT
IS COMEDIANS HAVE THAT TAKES THE
PLACE OF A GOD.
(LAUGHTER)
LAST WEEK, WE SPENT THREE DAYS
ON THIS STORY.
WE DID OVER 59 JOKES.
(LAUGHTER)
NINE PENIS PUNS.
WE USED AN R. KELLY IMPERSONATOR
TO PROVIDE "TRAPPED IN THE
CLOSET" STYLE COMMENTARY.
AND I...
(LAUGHTER).
AND I PERSONALLY SAID THE WORD
(BLEEP) TEN TIMES.
(LAUGHTER)
I ACKNOWLEDGE...
(APPLAUSE).
I ACKNOWLEDGE A PERSONAL
FRIENDSHIP WITH THE CONGRESSMAN
AND YET EXPRESS MY BELIEF THAT
HE WAS NOT BEING HONEST AND THAT
IF THE WORST OF HIS ALLEGATIONS
WERE, IN FACT, TRUE, HE SHOULD
RESIGN AND THEN I SAID THE WORD
(BLEEP) AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, THAT'S NICE.
I RECOGNIZE NOW THAT IT WAS NOT
ENOUGH.
YESTERDAY, CONGRESSMAN WEINER
CONFESSED THAT THE PENIS IN
QUESTION WAS, IN FACT, HIS OWN.
(LAUGHTER)
HE DID SO AT A PRESS
CONFERENCE...
(LAUGHTER).
HE DID SO AT A PRESS CONFERENCE
AT 4:30 IN THE AFTERNOON.
WE TAPE OUR PROGRAM AT 6:00 P.M.
I MADE THE DECISION TO DO A
COUPLE OF WEANER JOKES, MENTION
THE PRESS CONFERENCE BUT TO
MOSTLY STICK TO THE SCRIPT THAT
WE'D ALREADY WRITTEN ABOUT JOHN
EDWARDS AND SARAH PALIN.
THIS WAS MY DECISION.
(LAUGHTER)
MY DECISION ALONE.
I RECOGNIZE HOW WRONG I WAS.
(LAUGHTER)
DELICIOUS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S NOT GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO NEED TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.
(LAUGHTER)
(BLEEP) I BROUGHT PAIN TO PEOPLE
I CARE ABOUT-- MY STAFF, MY
AUDIENCE, MY BEAUTIFUL AND
EXOTIC FAMILY.
(LAUGHTER)
I DO NOT EXPLICITLY STATE THAT I
THOUGHT MR. WEINER HAD BEEN
DECEITFUL LAST NIGHT, THAT HE
WAS A LIAR AND THAT I BELIEVED
HIS PANTS TO BE ON FIRE.
(LAUGHTER)
ALTHOUGH, LUCKILY FOR THE
CONGRESSMAN, IT APPEARS HE HAS A
FIRE SAFETY SYSTEM ON BOARD.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, FOR THESE REASONS,
UNLIKE THE CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE
DECIDED TO STEP DOWN
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
NO, EVERYONE, PLEASE.
