THERE WERE A LOT OF ALSOCONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES
SEATS THAT WERE UP.
HERE'S SOME INCUMBENTREPUBLICANS THAT I THOUGHT
WOULD BE OF INTERESTTO OUR AUDIENCE.
TEXAS' FIRST DISTRICT WHERELOUIE GOHMERT REPRESENTS IT
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S AS HIGHAS HE CAN COUNT.
HE, HE -- LET'S SEE, HE'S UPAGAINST SHIRLEY MCKELLAR,
THE DEMOCRAT, AND HE --
OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS WRONG WITHTHOSE PEOPLE?
WE ALSO HAVE PAUL RYAN, HEWINS IN WISCONSIN, THE GUY THE
DEMOCRATS PICKED TO LOSE TO
PAUL RYAN HAS INDEED LOST TOHIM.
SO THAT'S GONE, BUT THIS ONEIS ESPECIALLY, WELL THIS ONE IS
A LITTLE NEAR AND DEAR TO THEHEARTS HERE.
THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN RUNNINGFOR CONGRESS, REPUBLICAN SIDE,
WHO HAD A 20-COUNT FEDERALINDICTMENT AGAINST HIM,
HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST DOMENICRECCHIA WHO IS THE DEMOCRAT.
LET'S CHECK IN WITH THAT NOW.THE GUY FELL. OH, MY GOD!
NO, HE'S GOING TO TAKE HIM! OH,NO!
HE'S GOING TO THROW HIM OVER A(BLEEP) BALCONY!
(LAUGHTER)EVEN HIS GRAPHIC IMAGE --
