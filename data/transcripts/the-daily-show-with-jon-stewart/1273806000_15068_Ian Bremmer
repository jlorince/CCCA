>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT, A
JOURNALIST AND AN AUTHOR
WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE
END OF THE FREE MARKET, WHO
WINS THE WAR BETWEEN STATES
AND CORPORATIONS.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM IAN BREMMER.
(APPLAUSE)
HELLO, SIR.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THE END OF THE FREE MARKET.
I'LL TELL YOU, YOU ARE A
HELL OF A WRITER.
THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX,
DIFFICULT SUBJECT, TACKLED
BEAUTIFULLY.
I ACTUALLY FELT LIKE I
UNDERSTOOD SOMEWHAT THE NEW
THREAT.
YOUR FEELING IS THE BIG
THREAT TO OUR ECONOMY MAY
NOT EVEN BE WALL STREET'S
NEWSPAPERS, REGULATIONS AND
THINGS EVEN THOUGH THEY
NEED-- IT'S STATE
CAPITALISTS OR STATEEST
CAPITALISM.
WHAT'S THAT.
>> WE'RE FOCUSING A LOT
RIGHT NOW ON GOLDMAN, WE ARE
FOCUSING ON THE-- IT FEELS
GOOD.
>> Jon: IT FEELS VERY, VERY
GOOD.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
BUT THE LAST 18 MONTHS, THE
WORLD HAS CHANGED FASTER
THAN AT ANY POINT SINCE THE
END OF WORLD WAR II.
>> RIGHT.
>> WE USED TO BE IN A
SITUATION WHERE IT WAS THE
G-7 WORLD AND YOU HAD STATES
THAT SUPPORTED FREE MARKETS.
SOMETIMES MORE REGULATED.
SOMETIMES LESS.
BUT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT AN
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE
WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST
ECONOMY AND THE FASTEST
GROWING OUT OF THE RECESSION
IS ONE WHERE THE STATE
CONTROLS THE ECONOMY.
THE LARGEST PLAYER.
THERE'S NO RULE OF LAW.
>> Jon: WE'RE TALKING CHINA.
>> I'M TALKING CHINA.
SO AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU
DON'T HAVE A FREE MARKET ANY
MORE.
YOU HAVE SOME FREE MARKET
STATES THAT AREN'T DOING SO
WELL.
AND YOU HAVE SOME STATE
CAPITAL STATES.
AND BY THE WAY, YOU GO TO
CHINA AND YOU ASK THE
AVERAGE CHINESE WHAT THEY
THINK ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT,
THEY HAVE A LOT BETTER VIEW
OF THIS THAN THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN DOES OF THE PERSON
GOVERNMENT, FOR ITS-- LORD
KNOWS GREEKS AND JAPANESE.
>> Jon: IT'S CRAZY, CHINA,
THE ONE COUNTRY THAT TRULY
LOVES TEA, NO TEA PARTY,
REALLY, YOU KNOW.
THEY LOVE THEIR GOVERNMENT.
HERE, YOU KNOW, IT STRIKES
ME AS-- WHAT THESE AUTHOR
AUTHOR-- AUTHORITY TATING
GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE, CHINA
AND RUSSIA HAVE POWERED THE
CAPITALISM TO QUELL
ALMOST-- IT IS LIKE A HEDGE
AGAINST REVOLT.
THEY'RE USING OUR SYSTEM TO
THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT NOT
USING THE DOWNSIDE OF OUR
SYSTEM, THE VOLATILITY THAT
THEY DON'T FACE THAT.
IT SEEMS.
>> I DIDN'T SEE A GLOBAL
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
I SAW A FINANCIAL CRISIS IN
THE WEST.
CHINESE DIDN'T HAVE THE
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE BANKS.
THEY CONTROLLED THEIR BANKS.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE SORTS
OF EXPOSURE.
THEY HAD A RECESSION.
>> Jon: YOU ARE NOT
SUGGESTING WE MOVE TIE MORE
AUTHOR TEARIAN ECONOMY WHERE
THE STATE HAS MORE CONTROL
OF IT, YOU BELIEVE THAT WE
HAVE TO MAKE THE FREE MARKET
MORE APPEALING.
>> I THINK WE DO.
I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION.
BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORLD
ECONOMY IS NOT WHAT IT WAS.
AND OUR MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS ARE TRYING TO
GET INTO THE STATUS
ECONOMIES AND A LOT WILL GET
GOOGLED OUT.
IF YOU GET A SITUATION WHERE
YOU HAVE A WAR-- .
>> Jon: CAN GOOGLE DO THAT
NOW?
CAN THEY GOOGLE YOU OUT.
IS THERE A BUTTON ON GOOGLE
WHERE YOU CAN GET GOOGLED
OUT.
>> THIS IS A PASSIVE VERB.
THEY GOT GOOGLED.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO GET
GOOGLED OUT.
>> I DON'T BLAME YOU.
PEOPLE WILL COME SEARCHING
FOR YOU.
>> Jon: THE DIFFICULTY IS,
IT SEEMS LIKE
VOLATILE-- VOLATILITY.
THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE, AND
MAYBE IT'S-- I'M CONFUSING
THE DERIFF
TOUGHER-- DERIVATIVE MARKET
WITH SOMETHING BUT WE HAVE
THIS UNREGULATED
REDIFFICULT-- DERIVATIVE
MARKET THAT IS
LARGELY-- LARGER MONETARILY
THAN ECONOMY OF ALL 9 MONEY
IN THE WORLD.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT
COULD BE REAL.
ISN'T IT LIKE $700 TRILLION
IN THIS DERIVATIVE MARKET.
>> WHEN ARE YOU TAKING BETS
WITH NO UNDERLIING ASSETS
YOU ARE CREATING CASINO,
THAT IS IN THE A REGULATED
FREE MARKET.
THAT IS AN UNREGULATED FREE
MARKET.
THE REASON I NAMED THE BOOK
THIS, I HAD THIS MEETING
WITH ABOUT A YEAR AGO WITH
THE VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS OF CHINA.
TURNED OUT TO BE THE GUY
THAT OBAMA WAS FORCED TO
MEET WITH WHEN-- DIDN'T SHOW
UP AT COPENHAGEN.
KIND OF INTERESTING RZ.
>> Jon: YOU LIKED THIS GUY,
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS WARM AND
ENGAGING.
>> HE IS A VERY SMART GUY,
IMPRESSIVE GUY.
BUT THE FIRST THING HE ASKED
ME IS HE SAID, SO IAN, NOW
THAT THE FREE MARKET HAS
FAILED, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND
THE ECONOMY SHOULD BE.
THE FREE MARKET HASN'T
FAILED.
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST
TEN YEARS IS NOT THE FAILURE
OF FREE MARKET.
AND WHAT OBAMA IS DOING
RIGHT NOW IS NOT SOCIALISM.
THERE WAS NO REFEREE.
THERE WERE NO REGULATORS
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON WALL
STREET.
THAT'S NOT A FREE MARKET
SYSTEM.
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, 'S
HAVING A HARD TIME RIGHT NOW
DEFENDING OUR FREE MARKET
PRINCIPLESS.
OBAMA IS TO THE GOING OUT
THERE SAYING I SUPPORT THE
FREE MARKET.
HE IS SAYING I DON'T WANT TO
RUN GM THAT IS TOO HARD.
I HAVE TOO MANY OTHER THINGS
TO DO.
IT IS NOT POLITICALLY
DEFENSIBLE TODAY TO GO OUT
AND SUPPORT FREE MARKETS
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THAT
IS WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY
GREAT.
>> Jon: ARE WE HAVING THE
WRONG CONVERSATION IN THE
COUNTRY.
BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION
APPEARS TO BE ON ONE SIDE WE
ARE BECOMING A SOCIALIST
COUNTRY, WHICH I THINK HAS
DEFINED THE DEFINITION OF
SOCIALISM DOWN TO AN EXTENT
THAT I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S
RECOGNIZABLE AS SOCIALISM F
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING IN
THIS COUNTRY.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE STILL
DOING THE SAME REGULATED
FREE MARKET THING WITH A
COUPLE OF WEIRD TWEAKS DUE
TO A CATASTROPHE.
BUT THE CONVERSATION APPEARS
TO BE BETWEEN THAT AND MORE
REFORM IN OTHER AREAS THAT
DON'T SEEM TO BE TAKING HOLD
SO WHAT CONVERSATION
CONVERSATION-- CONVERSATION
SHOULD WE BE HAVING ON THE
ECONOMIC FRONT?
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY
AMERICA PROCEEDS IS FOR US
TO BE PERCEIVED AS
INDISFENCE-- INDISPENSABLE.
WE WANT PEOPLE TO WANT TO
INVEST HERE.
WE NEED OUR COMPANIES TO BE
INDISPENSABLE, OUR ECONOMY
TO BE PERCEIVED AS TOO BIG
TO FAIL, TO THE JUST
CITIGROUP OR B OF A, BUT THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> Jon: PERCEIVED AS OR AS.
>> I THINK WE ARE.
WE ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST
ECONOMY.
WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS.
WE HAVE THE ONLY BLUE WATER
NAVY THAT CAN ACTUALLY
DEFEND, YOU KNOW, SORT OF
SEA LANES AND THE REST.
WE SPEND MORE MONEY ON R & D
BUT WE HAVE THE CHINESE
SAYING THE UNITED STATES
SHOULD NOT BE THE RESERVE
CENTS EAR IT IS NOT SAFE.
EVERYONE WANTS TO BUY GOLD
AND IT IS GOING THROUGH THE
ROOF.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU THINK
CHINA IS BEING DISINGENUOUS,
OTHERWISE WOULDN'T THEY BE
DUFERPING, THEY ARE THE
LARGEST HOLDER IN THE
UNIVERSAL.
>> I THINK THEY ARE ONLY
BEING SOMEWHAT DISINGENUOUS.
WHEN YOU SEE THEM TRYING TO
DIVERSIFY THEIR EXPORTS AWAY
FROM THE WEST BECAUSE THE
U.S. CAN'T BUY THE CRAP THEY
USED TO, NEITHER CAN THE
EUROPE MEANS OR THE JAPANESE,
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO
BUILDOUT THEIR OWN DOMESTIC
CONSUMPTION AS FAST AS THEY
CAN.
>> Jon: THEY ARE TRYING TO
CREATE A MIDDLE CLASS THAT
WILL BUY THE CRAP THAT WE
USED TO BUY BECAUSE WE DON'T
WANT TO BUY IT ANY MORE
BECAUSE WE WILL GET FROM
SOME OTHER IMPOV ERREDISHED
COUNTRY.
LET'S GO BACK TO
MERCANTILISM.
>> A LONG TIME AGO.
>> Jon: IS DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS CONVERSATION
THAT WILL BEGIN TO BE HAVE,
THAT RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE IN
THE GOVERNMENT AND ON
TELEVISION WILL START TO
HAVE THE REAL CONVERSATION
ABOUT PROMOTING THE KIND OF
REGULATED FREE MARKET
CAPITALISM THAT WE NEED TO
MAKE THESE CHANGES.
>> THEY ARE STARTING TO DO
IT IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE
CRISIS POINT.
UNITED STATES WE DON'T FEEL
THAT LEVEL CRACE IS.
WE SPENT ALMOST A YEAR
DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE.
I THINK IS AN IMPROVEMENT.
BUT DID WE REALLY HAVE THE
LUXURY OF SPENDING THAT YEAR
WITH THIS GOVERNMENT ON
HEALTH CARE?
WE DID NOT.
THAT WAS THE WRONG PRIORITY.
AND NOW WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN ELECTION.
AND SO LET'S PILE ON GOLDMAN
SACHS.
AGAIN GREAT TV.
BUT.
>> Jon: WE NEED TO LOOK
AHEAD.
WE DO NEED TO LOOK AHEAD.
>> Jon: BUT AGAIN IN ALL
FAIRNESS, GREAT TV.
>> GREAT TV.
>> Jon: YOU REALLY HAVE
TO-- IT IS SO WELL DONE, AND
SO UNDERSTANDABLE AND WELL
LAID OUT I REALLY THANK YOU.
THE END OF THE FREE MARKET,
ON THE BOOK SHELVES MAY
