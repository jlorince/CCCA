DECISION IN FULL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH, MUCH
MORE COVERAGE TOMORROW ON THESE
LANDMARK GAY MARRIAGE DECISIONS
BUT ONE MORE THING WE HAVE TO
GET THROUGH TONIGHT BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCHED OUR
SHOW LAST NIGHT.
IF YOU DID, BE MISTAKE.
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT.
WHY?
BECAUSE YOU MISSED SOMETHING
INCREDIBLE HAPPENING IN THE
TEXAS STATE SENATE.
>> IT WAS A LATE AND WILD NIGHT
AT THE TEXAS STATE HOUSE.
A DAY LONG FILIBUSTER ENDING
WITH A CONTROVERSIAL VOTE ON
ABORTION RESTRICTIONS.
>> DEMOCRAT WENDY DAVIS TOOK THE
SENATE FLOOR AT 11:18 IN THE
MORNING.
THE GOAL: FILIBUSTER FOR SOME 13
HOURS UNTIL MIDNIGHT WHEN THE
SPECIAL SESSION OF THE
LEGISLATURE WOULD EXPIRE.
>> John: IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLOT
OF FRANK CAPRA'S CLASSIC MOVIE
"MRS. SMITH WANTS AN ABORTION."
WHAT EXACTLY IS AT STAKE?
>> AT STAKE, A BAN ON ABORTIONS
AFTER 20 WEEKS AND A REQUIREMENT
THAT ALL PROCEDURES BE DONE AT
SURGICAL CENTERS.
THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
AVAILABLE ABORTION CLINICS IN
THE STATE FROM 47 TO 5.
>> John: HOLD ON.
IS FIVE ABORTION CLINICS IN
269,000 SQUARE MILES REALLY SO
BAD?
THINK ABOUT IT.
TEXAS WILL STILL HAVE THREE MORE
ABORTION CLINKS THAN IT HAS SIX
FLAGS AMUSEMENT PARKS.
LET'S BE FAIR.
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MATH.
IF SENATOR DAVIS CAN TALK 13
HOURS, TEXAS WOMEN WON'T HAVE TO
DRIVE 13 HOURS TO GET AN
ABORTION.
OKAY.
HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?
>> YOU CAN'T TRADE OFF WITH A
COLLEAGUE TO GET ANY RELIEF.
YOU CANNOT SIT DOWN.
YOU CANNOT EAT.
YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE PODIUM OR
THE DESK.
YOU CANNOT LEAVE EVEN FOR A
SECOND FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING
HAVING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
YOU HAVE TO STAY ON THE TOPIC OF
THE BILL YOU ARE FILIBUSTERING.
>> John: OF COURSE -- AND THIS
IS IMPORTANT -- THERE IS NO SEX
IN THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM.
THIS IS THE SENATE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT.
AT LEAST THOUGH TEXAS ACTUALLY
MAKES YOU FILIBUSTER DURING A
FILIBUSTER, UNLIKE WASHINGTON
WHERE THE RULE IS BASICALLY, I'M
GOING TO FILIBUSTER AND THEN
I'LL GET A PEDESTRIAN CURE AND
IT STILL COUNTS.
PHILADELPHIA BUSTERRERS MAKE ME
TIRED.
... FILIBUSTERS MAKE ME TIRED.
OKAY.
SENATOR DAVIS, COUNTDOWN CLOCK
IS SET TO 13 HOURS.
TALK THE TALK.
>> AT TIMES SHE WAS PASSIONATE.
ND WHAT IS SO DISTURBING IS
THAT WE DON'T SEEM TO CARE.
>> OTHER TIMES DEFIANT.
I'M NOT YIELDING FOR ANY
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT.
>> SENATOR DOES NOT YIELD.
HE REMAINS STANDING IN HER
PINK SNEAKERS FOR NEARLY 11
HOURS STRAIGHT.
>> John: BRAVO.
BRAVO.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE KIND OF
ATHLETIC FEET THAT WILL
DEFINITELY GET YOU A PRODUCT
ENDORSEMENT DEAL AT THE VERY
LEAST.
FILIBUSTERS.
FOR WHEN YOU JUST HAVE TO STAND
THERE.
STAND THERE.
AND DO NOTHING ELSE.
THE OPPONENTS WERE EQUALLY
DETERMINED TO ABORT HER
FILIBUSTER BEFORE IT REACHED ITS
FULL 13-HOUR TERM.
>> STRIKE ONE WAS DAVIS' MENTION
OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHICH
REPUBLICANS SAID WAS OFF TOPIC.
STRIKE 2 CAME WHEN A COLLEAGUE
OFFERED DAVIS A BACK BRACE.
AND THE FINAL STRIKE CAME WHEN
DAVIS MENTIONED THE STATE'S 2011
SONOGRAM LAW.
AGAIN OFF TOPIC.
>> John: WHAT?
THIS IS A DEBATE ABOUT ABORTION
RESTRICTIONS.
HOW ARE PLANNED PRNTHOOD AND
FORCED SONOGRAMS OFF TOPIC?
THAT'S LIKE SAYING TALK TO ME
ABOUT WHITE CASTLE BUT DON'T
MENTION DIARRHEA.
THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
ULTIMATELY THAT JOKE LANDED HARD
WITH PEOPLE HERE.
ULTIMATELY DAVIS AND HER ALLIES
PUSHED THE DEBATE PAST THE
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE AND THE
ABORTION BILL DIED.
BUT THEN REPUBLICANS TRIED ONE
OF THE SHADIEST MOVES OF ALL
TIME.
>> FOR A WHILE THIS MORNING, IT
APPEARED AS THE STATE SENATORS
HAD INDEED VOTED TO PASS THE
BILL.
BUT JUST A FEW HOURS ALLEGE THE
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF TEXAS
ACKNOWLEDGED COMPUTER RECORDS
HAD BEEN CHANGED TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE REPUBLICANS VOTED THE BILL
THROUGH IN TIME WHEN, IN FACT,
THEY HAD NOT.
>> John: LOOK, LOOK, TEXAS.
YOU TRIEDED EVERYTHING YOU
COULD.
NOT EVEN AN ILLEGAL POST
MORTGAGE EM VOTE COULD REVIVE
THIS DEAD BILL.
BUT LOOK, LET'S NOT CONDEMN THE
TEXAS SENATE MAJORITY.
THEY'RE JUST BEING CONSISTENT.
THEY SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT IF LATE
ONE NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE SWEPT AWAY
BY YOUR EMOTIONS YOU MAKE A
STUPID MISTAKE, YOU SHOULD
ALWAYS HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX IT
LATER AND NOT HAVE TO LIVE WITH
THE CONSEQUENCES.
