(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST
TONIGHT IS THE SECRETARY OFTHE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT
OF HOUSING AND URBANDEVELOPMENT.
PLEASE WELCOME SECRETARYJULIAN CASTRO.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M DOING GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: VERY WELL, THANKYOU.
YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTERLOOKING THAN YOUR BROTHER.
YOU'VE GOT SOME NEW PROGRAM,TALKING ABOUT THIS NEW
PROGRAM THAT YOUR FHA, A NEWLOAN PROGRAM W WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?
ARE YOU GIVING US MONEY?
>> I'VE BEEN ON THIS JOBABOUT SIX MONTHS.
AND WE CALL OURSELVEOURSELVES THE DEPARTMENT OF
OPPORTUNITY.
THE PRESIDENT IS VERYFOCUSED ON MAKING
OPPORTUNITY MORE AVAILABLEFOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES.
>> Jon: YOU CHANGED THE NAMEOF HUD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
OPPORTUNITY.
>> WE HAVEN'T PUT IT ON THEBUILDING YET,.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT THIS,TRUMP.
>> DOESN'T HAVE THE SAMERING.
>> Jon: SO WE, THE PRESIDENTANNOUNCED A COUPLE OF WEEKS
AGO A REDUCTION IN MORTGAGEINSURANCE PREMIUMS AND THAT
SOUNDED BORING, BUT IT ISACTUALLY GOING TO MEAN THAT
FOLKS, NEW BORROWERS UNDERFHL-- FHA WOULD GET ABOUT A
SAVING ITS OF $900 A YEAR.
>> 2 MILLION FOLKS.
>> Jon: IF THEY ARE GOINGGET THEIR FIRST HOUSE.
>> MOSTLY FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS, BUT IT COULD ALSO
APPLY TO PEOPLE WHOREFINANCE AS WELL.
SO.
>> NOW PEOPLE GET NERVOUSWHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT
MORTGAGES AND REFINANCING,WE REMEMBER IN 2008
SOMETHING ABOUT MORTGAGESAND REFINANCING THAT
COLLAPSED THE GLOBALECONOMY.
AND I THINK FHA GOT LIKE ABILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT OR
BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARBAILOUT.
WHAT IS DIFFERENT NOW?
WHY IS FHA DIFFERENT, ANDWHY IS THIS DIFFERENT AND WE
SHOULDN'T WORRY?
>> FIRST THE FHA WAS NOT ANINSTITUTION THAT ENGAGED IN
THE RISKIER MORTGAGE PRODUCTLINE.
PEOPLE REMEMBER THOSE LOANS,NO DOC LOANS.
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT AFEW YEARS AGO WE WERE AT ONE
EXTREME.
IT WAS TOO EASY TO GET AHOME LOAN IN GENERAL OUT
THERE.
TODAY IT IS AT THE OTHEREXTREME.
>> FOLKS MAY REMEMBER ACOUPLE WEEKS AGO BEN
BERNANKE FORMER FED CHAIRSAYING HE COULDN'T REFINANCE
HIS MORTGAGE BECAUSE HECOULDN'T GET A LENDER TO DO
THAT.
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TOACHIEVE IN GENERAL IS TO
KEEP STRONG SAFEGUARDS INPLACE.
LIKE WE SET A CREDIT SCOREFLOOR.
IF YOU HAVE A CREDIT SCORE AWE NEED 580 YOU NEED TO PUT
TEN% DOWN INSIDE OF THREEAND A HALF.
>> HOW DO THEY CAPITAL ICEFHA, DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE
MONEY IN RESERVE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WE HAVEABOUT 40 -- IN RESERVE.
THE FHA HAS GOTTEN MUCHSTRONGER.
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGSTHAT ALLOWS US TO DO THIS
NEW AND TO KEEP SAFEGUARDSIN PLACE AND MEET THE
MISSION AS WELL OFINSURANCING THIS.
>> WHAT PERCENTAGE DO YOUHAVE TO BE AT FOR YOUR CAP?
LIKE WHAT IS IT, THEY MAKETHE BANKS AT 5%, THEY HAVE
TO HAVE CAPITAL INVESTMENTOF 5% ON THERE.
>> SO IT IS A 2% CAPITALRESERVE RATIO.
SO YOU GUYS ARE BEYOND THATWITH YOUR 40 BILLION.
>> NO, NO, WE'RE AT .41% BUTON A VERY STRONG TRAJECTORY
TO GET 2% IN THE NEXT COUPLEOF YEARS.
>> Jon: OKAY, I WAS WITH YOUFOR A SECOND.
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 40BILLION AND THEN JUST A
SECOND AGO YOU SAID WE HAVE.41 PERCENT.
>> WE HAVE-- OUR CAPITALRESERVE RATIO IS .41
PERCENT.
NOW-- .
>> Jon: THAT IS LOW, IS THATLOW?
>> IT'S NOT 29%, BUT IT'S ONA VERY STRONG TRAJECTORY TO
GET 2% IN THE NEXT COUPLE OFYEARS.
>> Jon: I WOULD HOPE YOU AREON THIS TRAJECT ORY.
>> WHEN YOU ARE AT .41PERCENT THERE IS NOT MUCH
TRAJECTORY.
>> A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TTO GIVE YOU A SENSE, WHEN
WE-- THE FHA NEEDED AMANDATORY DRAW T WAS AT
NEGATIVE 1.11.
SO IT ACTUALLY-- .
>> Jon: BOY, YOU'RE SELLINGTHE HELL OUT OF THIS.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: HERE IS WHAT I AMTELLING YOU.
WE WERE BANKRUPT BUT NOW WEGOT WALKING AROUND MONEY.
>> AND MORE THAN THAT, WE'REON A VERY STRONG TRAJECTORY
TO HIT OUR GOAL.
>> Jon: PEOPLE HAVE BEENWORKING WITH YOU ON THAT
WORD TRAJECTORY.
BUT THERE IS-- HERE IS WHATI NEVER UNDERSTOOD.
SO ALL THIS CART MONEY COMESIN, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.
WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST HELPHOMEOWNERS PAY DOWN THE
PRINCIPAL OF THEIR MORTGAGESTHAT WERE UNDERWATER?
WHY WERE WE BAILING OUTTHESE INSURANCE COMPANIES
WHEN WE COULD HAVE JUSTBAILED OUT INDIVIDUALS WITH
HOUSES THAT WERE UNDERWATERON THEIR PRINCIPAL?
>> PART OF THE MAKING HOMEAFFORDABLE EFFORT A COUPLE
OF YEARS AGO WAS THAT.
WHAT ESSENTIALLY WORKINGWITH HOMEOWNERS TO HELP THEM
STAY IN THEIR HOMES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE WERE MANYHOMEOWNERS UNDER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION APPROACH OFMAKING HOMES AFFORDABLE THAT
WERE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIRHOMES EVEN TODAY BECAUSE OF
THAT.
>> Jon: HOW MUCH OF THATMONEY HAVE-- HOW MUCH OF
THAT TARP MONEY, IT WAS LIKE30 BILLION ALLOCATED TO
THAT?
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO BEINACCURATE.
>> Jon: BE INACCURATE, IT'STHE DAILY SHOW, BE
INACCURATE.
>> BUT IT WAS SIGNIFICANT,IN THE LIVES OF MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILIES AND REGULAR FOLKSOUT THERE WHO WERE TRYING TO
HOLD ON.
>> Jon: ARE PEOPLE TAKINGADVANTAGE, DO THEY NOT KNOW
ABOUT IT?
>> NO, THEY DID.
THEY DID TAKE ADVANTAGE OFIT.
WE GO TO PLACES LIKE FLORIDA,NEVADA, ARIZONA, WERE SOME
OF THE HARDEST HIT PLACESDURING THE HOUSING CRISIS.
FOLKS WERE ABLE TO TAKEADVANTAGE OF THAT AND STAY
IN THEIR HOMES.
>> Jon: SO YOU ARE DOINGGOOD.
YOU'RE PUTTING OUT SOMEMONEY AND YOU ARE STILL
HELPING TO PAY DOWNPRINCIPAL OR REFINANCING
WITH THIS OTHER TARP MONEY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: HOW MUCH IS THATLEFT.
>> AND THERE IS A GOODAMOUNT OF THAT LEFT, THAT'S
RIGHT.
>> Jon: SO PEOPLE SHOULDCONTACT YOU.
>> OR THE TREASURYDEPARTMENT FOR THAT, FHA
FOR-- THE MORTGAGE INSURANCEPREMIUM.
>> Jon: AND YOU GUYS AREN'TGOING TO-- BUT WE'RE NOT
GETTING INTO THIS.
ONES YOU GIVE PEOPLEMORTGAGES, YOU ARE NOT
SELLING THEM, BUNDLING THEM,MAKING DERIVATIVES, HANDING
THEM OVER TO OTHER BANKS.
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THATSTUFF ANY MORE?
JUST SAY NO, JUST SAY NO.
>> NOT IN THE SAME WAY, NO.
NOT IN THE SAME WAY.
THERE'S STILL A SECONDARYMORTGAGE MARKET, JON.
>> Jon: FHA MORTGAGES, EVENTHE ONES YOU GUYS ARE DOING.
>> THOSE ARE SECURE TIES,SURE.
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THATNOW THE LAWS HAVE CHANGED.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE WITHFANNIE AND FREDDIE THE SAME
KIND OF A RISKY PRODUCT.
THOSE THINGS REALLY DIDN'TAPPLY.
>> AND THEY'RE OUT OF THEBUSINESS.
>> THEY ARE INCONSERVATORSHIP RIGHT NOW.
>> SO THE LANDSCAPE OFLENDING AND SECONDARY
MORTGAGE PRODUCTS HASCHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE
THEN.
AND YOU KNOW, FOR THE BETTEROBVIOUSLY.
>> Jon: SO WE HAVECONFIDENCE.
>> WE DO.
>> Jon: JUST SHOW ME WITH AHAND SIGNAL WHICH WAY THE
TRAJECTORY IS GOING.
>> IT'S GOING VERY WELL.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,ALL RIGHT.
NORMALLY I WOULD KEEP YOUAROUND FOR A LONG TIME, BUT
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOWTHIS, BUT IT IS THE MOVIE
"ALIVE" OUTSIDE.
>> THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.
>> Jon: I KNOW YOU HAVE TOGET OUT OF HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMINGBY.
SECRETARY JULIAN CASTRO, WEAPPRECIATE IT.
