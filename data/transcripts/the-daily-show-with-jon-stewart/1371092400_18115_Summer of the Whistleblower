>> John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW" I AM JOHN OLIVER.
JON STEWART IS GONE FOR THE
SUMMER.
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS BUT
SOMEONE GOT HIM PREGNANT.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S GONE TO A COMMUNITY FOR
OLDER THEN A SIMILAR SITUATION.
(LAUGHTER)
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE
MAGNIFICENT SINGER AND HUMAN
BEING MAVIS STAPLES IS HERE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MWAH!
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
THE EVER-GROWING LIST OF
SCANDALS THAT HAS BEFALLEN THIS
GREAT NATION.
THERE WAS THE I.R.S. TARGETING
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS, THE D.O.J.
SPYING ON JOURNALISTS, THE
N.S.A. CREEPING ON EVERYONE, AND
I ARE CENTLY G-O-D'S DECISION TO
RUIN THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND ON THE FOURTH DAY HE DID
ATTEMPT TO RUN UP THE MIDDLE AND
LO, HE WAS CRUSHED.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE LORD WAS SORE AMUSED.
LET'S ALL AGREE.
LET'S JUST ALL AGREE, WE ARE AT
PRECIPICE OF SCANDAL OVERLOAD
RIGHT NOW SO LET'S PLEASE JUST
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
>> AT THE RISK OF GIVING YOU
SCANDAL OVERLOAD, TONIGHT WE
HAVE A NEW ONE.
>> John: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A DIFFICULT
POSITION HERE!
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN
THIS TO JON STEWART?
"HEY, BOSS, YEAH, THE SHOW'S
GOING OKAY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THE
COUNTRY MIGHT BE COMPLETELY
FALLING APART."
(LAUGHTER)
AND, BY THE WAY, GOOD LUCK
TRACING A FINGER PHONE, N.S.A.!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO WHAT IS THIS NEW SCANDAL?
>> SOME OF THE STATE
DEPARTMENT'S OWN AGENTS ARE
CHARGING THAT INVESTIGATIONS
WERE MANIPULATED TO PROTECT
CAREERS OR TO AVOID SCANDAL.
AT LEAST ONE IS CHARGING WHEN
THEY INVESTIGATED A SERIES OF
COVERUPS IT WAS COVERED UP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> John: WOW.
SO A COVERUP OF A COVERUP OF A
SCANDAL!
IT'S LIKE A TURDUCKEN OF LIES.
(LAUGHTER)
THINK NEW SCANDAL SOUNDS
GRIEGING BUT IF THIS WAS ALREADY
TRIPLE COVERED UP, AGAIN, HOW
DID WE FIND OUT ABOUT IT?
>> HE WAS AN INVESTIGATOR FOR
THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNAL
WATCHDOG AGENCY AND IS NOW A
WHISTLE-BLOWER.
>> YOU ARE KIDDING ME.
ANOTHER WHISTLE-BLOWER.
IT'S THE SECOND ONE IN A WEEK.
IF YOU'RE A WHISTLE, THIS IS THE
WEEK THAT YOU ARE GETTING BLOWN!
(LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT SURE THAT QUITE CAME OUT
RIGHT.
IN FACT, I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON
A LIMB AND JUST CALL IT FOR ALL
OF US.
WE ARE IN THE SUMMER OF THE
WHISTLE-BLOWER.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHAT IS THIS STATE DEPARTMENT
WHISTLE-BLOWER BLOWING THE
WHISTLE ON-- HE ASKS KNOWING
THAT IT WOULD INVOLVE
PROSTITUTES.
>> ACCUSATIONS OF PROSTITUTES,
DRUG DEALS AND SEXUAL ABUSE NEAR
U.S. EMBASSIES.
A U.S. AMBASSADOR SOLICITED
SEXUAL FAVORS FROM PROSTITUTES.
A MEMBER OF HILLARY CLINTON'S
SECURITY ENGAGED PROSTITUTES
WHILE ON OFFICIAL TRIMS IN
COLOMBIA AND RUSSIA.
>> CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL HAD
A "PROSTITUTION PROBLEM" THAT
WAS "ENDEMIC."
>> John: ENDEMIC?
HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT, BABY, MY
NEED TO PAY FOR SEX WAS ENDEMIC!
IT WAS JUST PART OF THE CULTURE
AT WORK!
LIKE HOW YOU AND THE GIRLS AT
THE OFFICE ALL DID THAT CLEANS
TOGETHER.
(LAUGHTER)
THINK OF PROSTITUTE AS OUR
GINGER APPLE KALE JUICE.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW AT THIS POINT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT SCANDAL IS JUST
ALLEGATIONS SO AS WHISTLES GO
IT'S THE KIND OF WHIS THAT WILL
AN ASTHMATIC KITTEN MAKES WHEN
IT TRIES TO BREATHE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
RELAX!
THIS FICTITIOUS CAT IS GOING TO
LIVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M BEING TOLD IT DIED.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
IT WAS HIT BY A MAKE BELIEVE
CAR.
