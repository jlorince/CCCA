>> AT A CONFERENCE IN LOSANGELES LAST WEEK KARL ROVE
SUGGESTED HILLARY CLINTONMAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE.
HE CITED THE FORMER SECRETARY OFSTATE'S HEALTH SCARE BACK IN
2012 WHEN SHE FELL AND SUFFEREDBLOOD CLOT.
HERE'S A QUOTE, "30 DAYS IN THEHOSPITAL AND WHEN SHE
REAPPEARS SHE'S WEARING GLASSESTHAT ARE ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO
HAVE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S UP WITHTHAT."
>> YES. YES, WE NEED TOKNOW WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?
KIND OF PETERED OUT AT THEEND THERE, FOR ROVE, DIDN'T HE?
IS HILLARY CLINTON TOO MENTALLYSCRAMBLED TO RUN THE COUNTRY?
I MEAN, WHAT THE DEAL-IO? ONEPROBLEM, THOUGH,
WITH AMBASSADOR ROVE'SSTATEMENT, SECRETARY CLINTON
WAS ACTUALLY IN THE HOSPITAL FORFOUR DAYS, NOT 30.
APPARENTLY, KARL ROVE UNSKEWEDTHAT NUMBER.
CLEARLY, HE THOUGHT CRANIUM GATEWAS GOING TO BE A SLAM-DUNK
TALKING POINT. TURNSOUT NOT REALLY.
>> HOW DID THIS COMMENTCOME UP SUGGESTING THAT
HILLARY CLINTON MAY SUFFERFROM BRAIN DAMAGE?
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
>> NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE. NO,NO,
I DIDN'T SAY SHE HADBRAIN DAMAGE --
>> I NEVER SAID BRAIN DAMAGE!I MERELY NOTED, IN PASSING, THAT
SHE WAS WEARING TRAUMATICBRAIN INJURY EYEWEAR -- WHAT DO
YOU CALL IT THERE --LOBOTO-LENSES! WHATEVER.
THE BOOP BOOP GLASSES. YOU KNOW,WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM!
REALLY KARL, YOU SURE YOU DON'TWANT TO GO CONSPIRACY ROUTE ON
THIS ONE?
>> SHE HAD APPARENTLY ASERIOUS VIRUS. THEY ANNOUNCED
THEN ON THE 15TH OF DECEMBERTHAT SHE HAD AT SOME PERIOD IN
THE PAST WEEK FALLEN. THEYDIDN'T SAY WHEN, THEY DIDN'T SAY
WHERE. SHE WASRECOVERING AT HOME.
ON THE 30th OF DECEMBER, SHEGOES IN AND TURNS OUT TO HAVE
HAD A BLOOD CLOT. THEYWON'T SAY WHERE.
>> UNANSWERED QUESTIONS!
AN ATTEMPTED COVERUP!
MY GOD, IT'S BRAINGHAZI!

WE NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH!

JUST ONE QUICK QUESTIONBEFORE YOU GO THERE,
HOUSE M.D.
WHEN DID YOU START CARING SOMUCH ABOUT THE FITNESS OF THOSE
WHO HAVE TO HOLD THE OVALOFFICE?
(APPLAUSE)PERHAPS, I ASSUME IT WAS RIGHT
AFTER YOUR BOSS FELL ANDBANGED HIS HEAD AFTER
LOSING A BATTLE WITH A PRETZEL.
