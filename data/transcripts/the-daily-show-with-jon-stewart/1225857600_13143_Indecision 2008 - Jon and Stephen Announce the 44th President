>> CNN HAS HOLOGRAM TECHNOLOGY
AND I FEAR THAT YOU ARE, IN
FACT, A HOLOGRAM.
>> OH, OH I MAY NOT BE HERE,
JON, BUT I AM SCRATCH AND SNIFF.
>> I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT
THAT UP.
I DO HAVE ONE RESULT THAT I
WANT TO BRING UP THAT I THINK...
I WENT TO SCHOOL AT THE COLLEGE
OF-- AND IT IS A COMMONWEALTH OF
VIRGINIA, AND IT IS.
>> PROUD STATE.
>> PROUD STATE, CONSERVATIVE
STATE.

HERE.
>> THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA,
VIRGINIA IS FOR LOVERS... OF
BARACK OBAMA.
HE HAS WON VIRGINIA.

VIRGINIA HAS NOT GONE
DEMOCRATIC, I THINK...

BATTLE OF JERICHO.
>> SO IT IS BECOMING AN
INTERESTING...
BREATH-- TO TAKE A MOMENT AND TO
THINK ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
OFTENTIMES THIS COUNTRY, THERE
ARE VERY FEW COUNTRIES IN THE
WORLD THAT LIVE UP TO THEIR
CREED-- THAT LIVE UP THE SIX TO
THE DOCUMENTS OF THE FOUNDING
ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.
>> THAT'S TRUE, JON.
>> AND AMERICA HAS PROVEN ITSELF
ON A WORLD STAGE AS A SHOW
COUNTRY, NOT A-- THAT WE HAVE
LIVED UP TO OUR CREED THAT WE
ARE -- WE ARE WHAT WE SAY WE ARE
AND THERE IS NOT A LOT OF
COUNTRIES, THAT CAN SAY THAT
BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE SAID
"LOOK AT US, WE ARE DEPRESSED
AND
EAT CHEESE, BUT AMERICA TONIGHT
LIVES UP TO ITS PROMISES."
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, JON.
>> ANY THOUGHTS?
>> HE MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN THIS
THING, AND IF HE DOES I DON'T
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS.
BUT I DO HAVE-- I DO HAVE A
LOT OF FEELINGS.
I AM NO SUPPORTER OF OBAMA,
BUT IF HE DOES WIN-- AND ANYONE
WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THIS IS A
NIGHT LONG OVER DUE US AS A
NATION REACHED THE MOUNTAINTOP
BECAUSE AT LONG LAST THE UNITED
STATES HAS FULFILLED THE
GREATEST PART OF FREEDOM.

PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SEGREGATED FROM
THE REST OF AMERICA LITERALLY ON
AN ISLAND-- HAWAIIAN KIDS
GROWING UP IN GRASS HUTS,
THOUGHT THEIR
ONLY CHOICE IN LIFE WAS SELLING
POI ON STREET CORNERS OR
CARVING TIKI IDOLS NOW THEY KNOW
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAN
MAKING IT BIG AS A UKULELE
PLAYER
THEY COULD BE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE )

MERRY CHRISTMAS BUT THE POINT IS

I MAY, AND THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL
SOUND YOU ARE MAKING AT 11:00
