>> Jon: WELCOME TO MY GUEST
TONIGHT HE IS THE SENIOR
JUDICIAL ANALYST FOR THE FOX
NEWS CHANNEL, HOST OF
FREEDOM WATCH ON THE FOX
NEWS NETWORK.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED IT IS
DANGEROUS TO BE RIGHT WHEN
THE GOVERNMENT IS WRONG.
THE CASE FOR PERSONAL
FREEDOM.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM JUDGE ANDREW
NAPOLITANO, SIR!
(APPLAUSE)
SOLIS EN, IT'S NICE TO
FINALLY MEET YOU.
THE BOOK IS CALLED IT'S
DANGEROUS TO BE RIGHT WHEN
THE GOVERNMENT IS WRONG.
THE CASE FOR PERSONAL
FREEDOM.
SO FOR YOU.
>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU WOULD LIKE TO
SEE GOVERNMENT IS THE
ANTITHESIS OF LIBERTY IN
YOUR MIND.
>> YES.
>> GOVERNMENT EXISTS TO TAKE
AWAY FREEDOM.
WE ARE BORN FREE.
WE HAVE CERTAIN NATURAL
RIGHTS.
>> Jon: AND NAKED.
>> AND NAKED.
WE HAVE CERTAIN-- CAVIER
(LAUGHTER)
>> WE HAVE NATURAL RIGHTS BY
VIRTUE OF OUR HUMANITY AND
GOVERNMENT ESSENTIALLY
NEGATES THOSE RIGHTS.
SOME OF THOSE RIGHTS SHOULD
BE NEGATED LIKE THE RIGHT TO
KILL AND STEAL AND HARM.
SOME OF THEM SHOULD NOT BE
NEGATED LIKE THE RIGHT TO
EARN A LIVING.
LIKE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHAT
YOU WANT AND THINK WHAT YOU
WANT AND PUBLISH WHAT YOU
SAY.
GOVERNMENT FINDS WAYS TO GET
AROUND THOSE RIGHTS.
GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE TIME
INVADING AND AVOIDING THE
CONSTITUTION THAN ENFORCING
IT.
AND EVERYBODY IN THE
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AN OATH
TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION.
WHY DON'T THEY DO THAT.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS
INTERESTING BECAUSE IN MY
MIND, I WOULD VIEW
GOVERNMENT AS A SOMETIMES
BENEVOLENT FORCE THAT
PROTECTS PEOPLE, LIKE ONE OF
THE THINGS IT THAT I THINK
ENHANCES FREEDOM ARE ROADS.
AND I THINK THAT THE--
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE GOVERNMENT --
>>-- ROADS OR FREE ROADS.
>> Jon: I THINK ALL ROADS.
EVEN ONES THAT MIGHT COST A
DOLLAR OR TWO OR FOUR TO
TRAVEL ON, INFRASTRUCTURE IN
SOME WAYS ENHANCES FREEDOM,
A SOCIAL SAFETY NET CAN
ENHANCE FREEDOM.
I VIEW THOSE THINGS NOT AS
INFRINGEMENTS OF LIBERTY BUT
ENHANCEMENTS OF LIBERTY.
I'M WITH YOU ON THE LIBERTY
THING.
I THINK WE JUST DISAGREE ON
WHAT INFRINGES AND WHAT
ENHANCES IT.
>> WE DO.
AND SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT
CAN GO TOO FAR WITH RESPECT
TO SOCIAL SAFETY NETS, WHEN
THE GOVERNMENT PICKS WINNERS
AND LOSERS.
THE KIDS DEMONSTRATING IN
LOWER MANHATTAN, MI WITH
THEM ON THIS.
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE
TAKING OUR TAX DOLLARS AND
GIVING IT TO THE BIG FAT
BANKS TO BAIL THEM OUT.
IN MY VIEW THE KIDS ARE
RIGHT ON THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: LIBERTARIANS LIKE I
AM BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD NOT PICK WINNERS AND
LOSERS.
THE FREE MARKET SHOULD.
THE BANKS SHOULD RISE OR
FALL BY ITS ABILITY TO
ATTRACT BUSINESS, NOT ITS
ABILITY TO ATTRACT BUCKS
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO
WITH THE LOSERS THAT ARE
PICKED BY THE FREE MARKET?
>> THE LOSERS THAT ARE
PICKED BY THE FREE MARKET.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: BECAUSE ITS FREE
MARKET HAS LOWERSES.
>> YES, IT DOES.
>> Jon: SO WHAT DO WE DO
WITH THEM.
HOW BIG A PIT DO WE DIG?
>> IF A PERSON INVESTS THEIR
OWN MONEY IN A BUSINESS AND
LOSES, SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT
BAIL THEM OUT.
ANSWER, NO.
BECAUSE IF THE GOVERNMENT
BAILS THEM OUT, THERE WILL
BE NO LIMIT TO WHO AND FOR
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT BAILS
PEOPLE OUT.
YOU FAIL, YOU PICK UP AND
YOU START ALL OVER AGAIN.
EVEN SOME VERY, VERY FAMOUS
TV PEOPLE HAVE FAILED AND
STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN.
>> Jon: SURE, BUT ISN'T IT
THOUGH DO WE DECIDE, DO WE
LIVE IN A SOCIETY, OR DON'T
WE?
ARE WE A COLLECTIVE, AND
WHEN I SAY THAT I DON'T MEAN
EVERYBODY-- EVERYBODY'S
SUCCESS IS PREDICATED ON THE
HARD WORK OF ALL OF US.
NOBODY GETS THERE ON THEIR
OWN SO WHY SHOULD IT BE--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THAT THE PEOPLE THAT
LOSE ARE HUNG OUT TO DRY
BECAUSE HEY, MAN, FOR A
GROUP THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY BELIEVE IN
EVOLUTION, IT'S AWFULLY
DARWINNIAN.
>> ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, THE ATTRACTIVENESS
OF MY VIEW IS THAT OUR
RIGHTS COME FROM OUR
HUMANITY, WHETHER OUR
HUMANITY IS THE RESULT OF A
KNOWING INTELLIGENT GOD WHO
CREATED US OR WHETHER OUR
HUMANITY IS A RESULT OF
NATURAL SELECTION.
EITHER WAY, HUMAN BEING ARE
THE GREATEST THING ON THE
PLANET.
WE ARE BORN WITH FREE WILL.
AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN
A POSITION TO TAKE IT AWAY.
NOR IS THE GOVERNMENT TO
DECIDE WHO ARE THE WINNERS
AND WHO ARE THE LOSERS.
IF WE-- .
>> Jon: YOU SAY THAT
GOVERNMENT AS THOUGH IT IS
AN ALIEN ENTITY AND IN A
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, WE
ARE THE GOVERNMENT.
WE'RE THE ONES WHO SAY WE
HAVE WORK TO DO.
AND WE HAVE BUSINESSES TO
RUN.
AND WE HAVE CHILDREN TO
RAISE.
WE ELECT YOU AS OUR
REPRESENTATIVES TO LOOK
AFTER OUR INTERESTS WITHIN A
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY WILL DO HARM AT TIMES.
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULDN'T
BE REFORMED.
BUT IS IT, YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE AN INHERENT EVIL.
>> IT IS AN INHERENT EVIL.
>> Jon: OKAY, SO YOU I'M
ROOT.
>> YOU'RE NOT PUSHING ME
WHERE I DON'T WANT TO GO.
THAT-- .
>> WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT TO
TELL YOU WHAT TO PUT IN YOUR
BODY.
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE
NO RIGHT TO TELL YOU WHAT TO
PUT IN YOUR BODY, WHAT TO
EAT, WHO TO SLEEP WITH, WHO
TO MARRY.
THAT'S NONE OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE
THOSE DECISIONS ON YOUR OWN.
BUT WE-- HAVE A GOVERNMENT
THAT THINK MASS JORITY RULES
AND THEREFORE THE MAJORITY
IS RIGHT.
>> Jon: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> WE HAVE THE TURN KNEE OF
THE MAJORITY WHEN THEY GET
THEIR WAY JUST BECAUSE THEY
ARE NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
BUT IT'S A PENDULUM SWING.
>> HOW IS IT A PENDULUM,
JON.
>> Jon: WELL, SOMETIMES TO
PROTECT THE GREATER LIBERTY,
YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE
FORM AN ARMY OR GATHER A
GROUP TOGETHER TO BUILD A
WALL OR A LEVY.
>> I'M NOT BIG ON BUILDING
WALLS BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE
A ARMEY.
I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF WALLS TO
KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE
COUNTRY.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT AS SOON AS YOU BUILD AN
ARMY YOU HAVE NOW SAID WELL,
GOVERNMENT ISN'T ALWAYS
INHERENTLY EVIL BECAUSE WE
NEED IT TO HELP US
SOMETIMES.
SO NOW IT IS JUST THAT OLD
JOKE, I'M NOT GOING SLEEP
WITH YOU-- WOULD YOU SLEEP
WITH ME FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS, SURE, HOW ABOUT A
DOLLAR.
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM.
WE ALREADY DECIDED WHO YOU
ARE, NOW WE'RE JUST
NEGOTIATING.
>> YOU SAID GOVERNMENT THAT
GOVERNS LEAST GOVERNS BEST.
BUT THEY TRIED THAT, THE
ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION,
THEY TRIED IT 8 YEAR, DIDN'T
WORK,.
THEN WE TRIED IT WITH THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> WE TRIED IT WITH THE
CONSTITUTION AND 9 SAME
GENERATION WHO WROTE IN THE
CONSTITUTION CONGRESS SHALL
MAKE NO LAW BRIDGING THE
FREEDOM OF SPEECH-- THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES JOHN ADAMS PROSECUTED
A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FOR
MAKING FUN OF HIS WAIST LINE
BECAUSE THAT WAS-- PERCEIVED
AS BEING AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES-- .
>> Jon: HE WAS PUDGEY.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
WOULD --
>> HE WAS CALLED HIS ROTUNDITY.
(LAUGHTER)
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.
>> Jon: WE GOT TO GO.
SOLIS EN, YOU CAN STICK
AROUND.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING TO GO
NOW.
AND THEN WE'LL PUT THIS ALL
UP ON THE WEB.
>> WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME.
>> Jon: WHAT, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU'RE A JUDGE FOR
GOD'S SAKES.
I'M NOT GOING UP AGAINST
YOU.
IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE RIGHT
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS
WRONG.
IT IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES
NOW, JUDGE ANDREW
NAPOLITANO.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
