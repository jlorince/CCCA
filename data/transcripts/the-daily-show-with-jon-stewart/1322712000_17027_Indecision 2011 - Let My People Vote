["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG
PLAYING]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> JON: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
LATER -- WE'RE SO EXCITED
TONIGHT.
LATER ON THE PROGRAM WE'LL BE
SPEAKING TO A YOUNG IRISH
MUSICIAN NAMED BONO.
WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- TO HAVE THIS GENTLEMAN ON THE
SHOW.
FINALLY --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- FINALLY WHAT PUT US OVER THE
TOP, AND I SAY THIS TO ANY SHOW
LOOKING TO BOOK HIM, BASKET OF
HAGGAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WATCH
OUR SHOW REGULARLY AND I'M SURE
THERE'S ONE OF YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
, WE DEVOTED AN AWFUL LOT OF
TIME ON THE PROGRAM TO THE
AMERICAN ELECTIONS.
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT OTHER
COUNTRIES ALSO SOMETIMES CHOOSE
NEW LEADERS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME BACK UP.
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER
COUNTRIES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TRUE.
THERE'S AREAS ON THE MAP THAT WE
SOMETIMES LEARN ABOUT WHAT WE
ARE BOMBING THEM.
ONE OF THOSE SUCH COUNTRIES,
EGYPT, JUST HAD AN HISTORICAL
ELECTION.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
INDECISION COVERAGE.
♪ ♪
[ LAUGHTER ]
WOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
A PHARAOH REFERENCE AND A MUMMY
REFERENCE.
THAT IS THE EXTENT OF OUR
KNOWLEDGE OF EGYPT SADLY.
ANYWAY, SO JUST EIGHT SHORT
MONTHS AFTER THE HISTORIC
UPRISING THAT OUSTED HOSNI MIEW
BACKAR, THE DICTATOR, THE
EGYPTIANS BEGAN FREE OPEN
ELECTIONS ON MONDAY.
BESIDES THE LOGISTICAL AND
SAFETY CHALLENGES OF THE VOTE,
THE EGYPTIAN ELECTION PRESENTED
OTHER LESSER KNOWN ISSUES.
>> A LOT OF EGYPTIANS CAN'T READ
OR WRITE.
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE IN A
SYMBOL INSTEAD.
>> IT'S LIKE A SOCCER BALL OR
VIKING SHIP.
>> THESE PARTIES, YOU CAN VOTE
FOR A TANK.
UP HERE THERE'S A PAIR OF
SUNGLASSES.
THERE'S A PYRAMID, A ROCKET OVER
HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO LOOK
DOWN MY NOSE AT THIS BUT IN WHAT
UNIVERSE DOES TANK LOSE TO
SUNGLASSES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
SERIOUSLY, IF I'M TANK I'M LIKE
I WILL (bleep) CRUSH YOU.
YOU'RE SUNGLASSES.
WHO IS CHOOSING?
LOOK, EGYPT, I KNOW YOU ARE KNEW
TO THIS, YOU WANT A
SOPHISTICATED DEMOCRACY YOU
CAN'T HAVE YOUR PARTIES
REPRESENTED BY A MYRIAD OF
SYMBOLS WITH EVERYTHING FROM
GUITARS TO ASSAULT WEAPONS
NOBODY WILL TAKE YOUR DEMOCRACY
SERIOUSLY UNTIL YOU HAVE JUST
TWO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
NOW THAT MAKES SENSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
STILL IF NOTHING ELSE THE SYMBOL
BASED ELECTION APPROACH HAS LED
TO INNOVATIVE ATTACK ADS.
>> HE SAYS HE KNOWS WHAT IS BEST
FOR EGYPT BUT ARE BLENDER'S
PRIORITIES ARE MIXED UP?
EVEN VIKING SHIP AGREES BLENDER
WILL SINK OUR ECONOMY FASTER
THAN A TOOTH BRUSH
ADMINISTRATION.
BUT SOCCER BALLS LEADERSHIP WILL
GET THINGS ROLLING AGAIN RIGHT
TOWARDS THE OBJECTIVE.
I'M SOCCER BALL AND I APPROVE
THIS MESSAGE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
I'M NOT IMPRESSED BY ANY.
I'M WAITING FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
TO GET INTO THE RACE.
