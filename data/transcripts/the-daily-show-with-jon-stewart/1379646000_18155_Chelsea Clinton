>> Jon: FUN SIZE CANDY. CAN'TBEAT IT.
>> BUT IF YOU COME I WILLMAKE SURE WE HAVE FUN SIZE
CANDY.
>> Jon: I'M OUT HERE EVERY NIGHTSLAMMING IT OUT 22 MINUTES A
DAY 4 DAYS A WEEK SO MY TIMEIS VERY LIMITED WITH THIS
SORT OF THING.
WHAT ARE SO PROGRAMS THAT IWOULD SEE IF I WERE TO GO
THERE.
>> OUR THEME THIS YEAR ISMOBILIZING FOR IMPACT.
SO HOW DO WE THINK ABOUTWHAT PARTNERS SHOULD BE
WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVEWHICH PROBLEMS.
AND THE PANEL I'LL BEMODERATING IS REALLY FOCUSED
ON NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASESBECAUSE-- I KNOW.
>> Jon: I DID NOT THINK THATWAS COMING.
>> THAT'S A MOUTHFUL.
>> Jon: NONCOMMUNICABLEDISEASE.
>>IT'S CALLED NCD FOR SHORT.
>> Jon: DOESN'T SEEM THATTHAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM IF
YOU CAN'T CATCH IT.
>> INCREASINGLY NUMBERS OFPEOPLE ARE DYING FROM IT.
>> Jon: LIKE THAT WHAT WOULDTHATEVEN ENTAIL?
>> HEART DISEASE.
>> Jon: IS IT HARD TO TALKTO PEOPLE LIKE ME SOMETIMES.
NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE, IDON'T GET IT, WELL, THERE IS
THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OFHUMANS.
>> IT IS, ACTUALLY.
>> Jon: NO, I KNOW.
>> AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Jon: IT'S A TERRIBLETHING.
AND SO EXCEPT FOR IN THEMOST LOW INCOME COUNTRIES,
IT'S NOW THE NUMBER ONE ORNUMBER TWO KILLER IN MUCH OF
THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
>> Jon: BUT NOT IN THENONDEVELOPING WORLD.
>> OH, NO IT ISDEFINITELY-- .
>> Jon: IT'S BAD HERE.
SO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THESTRATEGIES THAT THEY'RE
HOPING TO IMPLEMENT.
>> SO ONE OF THE REASONS I'MREALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS IS
IN 2005 MY FATHER AFTER HISQUADRUPLE HEART BY PASS
SURGERY NOT ONLY REALLYCHANGED HIS LIFE, WHICH I'M
GRATEFUL FOR AS A DAUGHTER,BUT HE REACHED OUT TO THE
AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATIONAND SAID I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT HEARTHEALTH.
WHAT I CAN DO.
AND THEY SAID CHILDHOODOBESITY, NOT WHAT HE WAS
EXPECTING TO HEAR.
AND SO NOW FAST FORWARD TO2013.
THE ALLIANCE FOR A HEALTHIERGENERATION, A PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN THE CLINTONFOUNDATION AND THE AMERICAN
HEART ASSOCIATION IS NOW THELARGEST ANTI-CHILDHOOD
OBESITY PROGRAM IN THECOUNTRY.
SO WE WORK WITH MORE THAN18,000 SCHOOLS, WE TOUCH
MORE THAN 11.5 MILLION KIDSEVERY DAY THROUGH HEALTHIER
LUNCH PROGRAMS, BETTER FOODIN OUR SNACK MACHINES, NO
FULL CALORIE SODAS IN THEIRSNACK AND SODA MACHINES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO I WILL BE TALKINGABOUT THE WORK THAT THE
CLINTON FOUNDATION WITHMARGARET CHAN WHO IS THE
DIRECTOR OF THE WHO ANDOTHER LEADERS WHO ARE
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY CANAND SHOULD BE DOING AROUND
THE WORLD TO STEM THE TIDEOF OBESITY AND OTHER RISK
FACTORS FOR NCD.
>> Jon: I'VE BEEN WORKING ONSOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH MY
KIDS CALLED GET UP.
>> AND MOVE HOPEFULLY.
>> Jon: GET OFF THE COUCH.
>> AND YOU LEAD OBVIOUSLY.
>> Jon: SO MANYFACTORS ARE STACKED AGAINST
PEOPLE NOW.
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WEPRODUCE FOOD NOW.
IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT WAYTHAN WE PRODUCED IT YEARS
AGO.
AND ISN'T SO MUCH OF HOW WEMANUFACTURE IT PART OF THE
CONCERN.
THE LOW COST, HIGH FRUCTOSEFOOD THAT HELPS TO FEED
PEOPLE, OF LOW INCOME, ALSOHELPS TO GIVE THEM THESE
TYPES OF DIABETES AND HEARTDISEASE.
HOW DO YOU BATTLE-- DON'TYOU HAVE TO BATTLE POVERTY
AT THE SAME TIME YOU'REBATTLING EXERCISE AND THINGS
AND DOESN'T THAT MAKE IT AMUCH MORE COMPLEX AN
DIFFICULT PROBLEM.
>> IT IS COMPLEX.
BUT IT'S ALSO JUST A LOT OFSMALLER PROBLEMS THAT ARE
AGGREGATED TOGETHER WAITINGTO BE BROKEN DOWN.
SO THEN WHAT IS THE ROLE OFTHE PRIVATE SECTOR, WHAT IS
THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENTINCLUDING THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
WHAT IS THE ROLE OFORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE
CLINTON FOUNDATION TO BRINGTHOSE DIFFERENT PARTIES
TOGETHER AND PROVE THAT WEREALLY CAN STEM THE TIDE OF
CHILDHOOD OBESITY.
AND MANY OF OUR SCHOOLDISTRICTS, WE HAVE SEEN THAT
THE RATES OF INCREASE HAVESTOPPED.
SO EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT-- .
>> Jon: THEY HAVE STABILIZEDSO WE HOPE TO DECREASE THOSE
NUMBERS SOON.
>> Jon: IT'S A BIG THING TOTAKE ON. IS THIS
ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHEREYOU ARE LOOKING AT THE
CARTER FOUNDATION, LOOK ATTHEM, THEY ERADICATED GUINEA
WORM, WE BETTER GET ON THISTHING LIKE IT'S A
COMPETITION NOW BETWEEN THECARTER FAMILY AND ITS
CLINTON FAMILY.
>> I'M OKAY WITH THATCOMPETITION.
>> Jon: CARTER IS OUT THEREGOING LOOK AT ME, I'M
GETTING RID OF MALARIA ANDYOU ARE LIKE CHILDHOOD
OBESITY.
>> IT'S A GREAT COMPETITION.
I WOULD ALWAYS BE HAPPYTO BE IN THAT RACE.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT WOULDBE A GREAT RACE.
WAS IT DIFFICULT, YOURFATHER HAS BEEN ON THIS
PROGRAM MANY, MANY TIMES.
>> AND HE WANTED ME TO SAYHE'S JEALOUS
I'M HERE AN HE'S NOT.
>> Jon: I DON'T BELIEVETHAT.
>> IT'S TRUE.
I SAW HIM THIS AFTERNOON.
>> Jon: HE'S SO SMART ANDHAS SUCH A COMMAND OF FACTS
THAT I THOUGHT BEING HIS KIDMUST HAVE BEEN LIKE-- HOW DO
YOU WIN AN ARGUMENT WITHTHAT DUDE?
LIKE WHERE IT'S JUST, HE COULDJUST
QUOTE YOU FACTS AND THIS ISWHY YOUR CURFEW IS AT 10,
LIKE YOU COULD NEVER-- DIDYOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU GOT
THE BETTER OF HIM WHEN YOUWERE YOUNGER?
>> WELL ONE OF MY MOSTFORMATIVE MEMORIES WAS
DURING THE 1986GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION IN
ARKANSAS.
IT WAS A REALLY NASTYELECTION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THERE OBVIOUSLY WERETHREE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY,
MY MOM, MY DAD AND ME.
AND THERE WAS AN UPCOMINGDEBATE SO IT WAS GOING TO BE
MY FATHER AGAINST HISOPPONENT WITH A MODERATOR.
AND THE THREE OF US OVERMANY EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS
WOULD PLAY DIFFERENT ROLESIN ADVANCE OF THIS DEBATE.
I WOULD HAVE TO PRETEND TOBE MY FATHER'S OPPONENT AND
ARGUE POSITIONS AGAINST HIM.
>> Jon: HOW OLD WERE YOU.
>> I WAS SIX.
I WOULD BE MY FATHER, AND HEWOULD BE HIS OPPONENT.
AND SO YOU KNOW THATJUST-- .
>> Jon: HOW MUCH FUN MUSTTHAT HAVE BEEN AS A
SIX-YEAR-OLD.
>> I WAS TAUGHT TO HOLD MYOWN AT A PRETTY EARLY AGE.
>> Jon: YOU ARE NOTKIDDING.
IF IT WERE MY KIDS THEYWOULD WANT TO HAVE DRESSED
UP LIKE THAT BUT NOT STAYEDWITH IT.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THEEND OF IT.
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLETO-- THEY WORKED IN GOVERNMENT
FOR SO LONG.
THEY STILL WORK INGOVERNMENT.
YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO NOT DOTHAT ROUTE.
IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUTUSING THESE NGOs AND OTHER
MEANS THAT MAYBE WATCHINGSOME OF THEIR FRUSTRATION --
FRUSTRATIONS WITH GOVERNMENTBUREAUCRACY AND THE WAY THE
MECHANISM AND LEVERS OF THATPOWER WORK, THAT LEADS YOU
INTO THIS OTHER DIRECTION,IS IT THAT PURPOSEFUL.
>> IT IS PURPOSEFUL FOR THISPOINT IN MY LIFE.
WHEN I STARTED TO THINKABOUT WHERE I WANTED TO
SPEND MY TIME, INVEST MYENERGY AND I KNEW THAT I
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING INTHE NONPROFIT SECTOR, I
COULDN'T IMAGINE ANORGANIZATION I WANTED TO
WORK WITH MORE THAN THECLINTON FOUNDATION.
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I'MCOMPLETELY BIASED TOWARDS MY
PARENTS.
BUT I-- .
>> Jon: THE IDEA THAT EVENYOU WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR
PARENTS.
LIKE IF MY KIDS WOULD EVENVISIT ME WHEN THEY GET TO BE
YOUR AGE, LIKE I'LL BE SOEXCITED, LIKE, I JUST THINK
THAT THAT IS NICE THAT YOUWOULDN'T BE LIKE-- YOU
WITHOUT REBEL AND BE LIKETHAT'S IT.
>> I TRIED TO CARE ABOUTDIFFERENT THINGS.
I SPENT A LOT OF TIMEWORKING IN THE PRIVATE
SECTOR.
AND I TRIED REALLY HARD TOWANT TO DENOMINATE SUCCESS
IN MY LIFE DIFFERENTLY THANMY PARENTS BECAUSE I THINK
MOST KIDS PROBABLY DON'TWANT TO GROW UP AND FEEL
LIKE THEY DEFAULTED INTOWHATEVER THEIR PARENTS HAVE
DONE, THOSE THAT HAVE BEENREALLY THE GALVANIZING ROLE
MODELS IN THEIR LIVES.
BUT ULTIMATELY I DID REALLYCARE ABOUT WHAT MY PARENTS
CARED ABOUT.
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TOWORK ON.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHY YOU ARE AGOOD KID.
>> I'M STILL TRYING TO MAKEMY PARENTS PROUD.
>> Jon: THAT'S NICE.
I SHOULD DO THAT.
>> I BET YOU DO EVERY NIGHT.
>> Jon: WE'LL TALKAFTERWARDS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMINGBY TODAY.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: PLEASE TELL YOUR POPAND YOUR MOM I SAID HEY.
CHELSEA CLINTON, EVERYBODY.
>> THANK YOU.
