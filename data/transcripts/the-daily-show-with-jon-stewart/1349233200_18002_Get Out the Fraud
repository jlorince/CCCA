FOR "CRAMER KIN." (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE ON THIS ISSUE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE.
LARRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LARRY, THESE -- THESE VOTER I.D.
LAWS AS WE SEE COULD POTENTIALLY DISENFRANCHISE THOUSANDS OF VOTERS.
YOUR REACTION?
>> YEAH, JON, ON BEHALF OF BLACK PEOPLE I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO AMERICA.
OBVIOUSLY THESE LAWS WERE MEANT TO SUPPRESS THE BLACK VOTE, WHICH HAS GONE 95% FOR OBAMA BUT IT WOUND UP HURTING INNOCENTS
LIKE JIM CRAMER'S DAD.
(LAUGHTER) SO SORRY, OLD PEOPLE.
THAT (BLEEP) WAS MEANT FOR US, NOT FOR YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S -- OKAY, SO I SHOULDN'T HAVE -- SORRY.
>> LOOK, JON, IN THE WORLD OF VOTER SUPPRESSION BLACK FOLKS ARE THE DELICIOUS TUNA.
(LAUGHTER) IRRESISTIBLE.
WORLD WAR II VETERANS AND GRANDMAS ARE JUST THE INNOCENT DOLPHINS WHO GET PULLED UP IN THE NET.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: UM -- IN YOUR MIND WHERE DID THESE LAWS GO WRONG?
>> RIGHT, WELL, LOOK.
THEY'RE TOO INDIRECT.
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE A LAW AND HOPE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS BLACK PEOPLE!
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT AS BLACK PEOPLE!
AND NOT JUST ON PAPER.
RACISM WORKS BEST IN PERSON.
DISTRUST BUT VERIFY.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: LIKE A COP PULLING YOU OVER FOR, LIKE, A D.W. B.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SORRY, WHAT'S THAT, JON?
>> Jon: A D.W.B., YOU KNOW, LIKE A -- DRIVING WHILE BLACK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> DID YOU JUST LEARN THAT PHRASE, STKPWHRO *PB.
>> Jon: NO!
NO!
YEAH.
UM -- CAT WILLIAMS SPECIAL.
>> YEAH.
D.W. B. WHAT ARE YOU DOWN WITH THE BROTHERS NOW, STKPWHRO *PB.
>> WHAT?
WHAT?
IS DOWN GOOD?
>> JUST DROP THE SLANG AND STEP AWAY, JON.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHEN A COP DOES A D.W.B. -- (LAUGHTER).
-- HE CAN SEE YOU'RE BLACK.
BUT WHEN YOU PURGE ELVIRA WASHINGTON FROM THE VOTER RULES, THAT SOUNDS BLACK BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE BEING PULLED OVER BY A BLIND COP.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW?
HE HEARS YOUR HIP-HOP MUSIC, HOW'S HE SUPPOSE TO KNOW YOU'RE A JEWISH KID FROM OBERLIN?
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: BUT, LOOK, THE WHOLE THING -- HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW.
THE WHOLE THING IS A FARCE.
IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD DOESN'T EXIST.
IT'S LIKE OUTLAWING NEW YORK MET WORLD SERIES CELEBRATIONS.
IT DOESN'T -- (LAUGHTER).
>> THERE YOU GO, JON.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> ACTUALLY, VOTER FRAUD LAWS HAVE GIVEN ME A GREAT IDEA.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
>> VOTER FRAUD.
(LAUGHTER) I URGE BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY AND OFTEN.
(LAUGHTER) AND THEN LATE, OKAY?
NOW, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A CONCERTED GET OUT THE FRAUD EFFORT.
>> Jon: ARE YOU SURE, LARRY, YOU WANT TO COME IN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND ADVOCATE BREAKING
THE LAW?
>> IT'S BASIC CABLE, IT'S NOT NATIONAL TELEVISION.
BESIDES, YOU CALL IT BREAKING THE LAW.
I CALL IT MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME.
ALL THOSE YEARS WE COUNTED AS THREE-FIFTHS OF A PERSON WHILE WE WERE DOING TEN-FIFTHS OF THE WORK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND FRACTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HOW OLD IS THIS COUNTRY, STKPWHRO *PB.
>> Jon: ABOUT 240?
>> HOW LONG HAVE BLACK PEOPLE BEEN ALLOWED TO VOTE?
>> Jon: ABOUT 150.
>> IN ALABAMA?
>> ABOUT 48.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
NOW WE'VE GOT TO KEEP EXTRA VOTING UNTIL WE CATCH UP.
HERE'S TIPS TO HELP BLACK PEOPLE EXTRA VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
OKAY?
FIRST, CONFIDENCE.
NOW, REMEMBER, THESE POLLING STATIONS ARE STAFFED BY SWEET OLD WHITE LADIES.
USE THAT (BLEEP)!
(LAUGHTER) OH, YEAH, YEAH, JUST WALK IN TALL, YEAH, THAT'S ME RIGHT THERE, MILDRED HIGGINS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: RIGHT, YEAH, YOU'RE MILDRED HIGGINS, SURE, YEAH, RIGHT.
>> YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
>> Jon: NO, GO AHEAD, YOU CAN GO RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S FINE.
>> WHICH BRINGS US TO TIP TWO: TWO: INTIMIDATION.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S NICE, I GET THAT.
>> SEE HOW I DID THAT?
I NEED TO VOTE?
WHERE'S MY BALLOT?
>> Jon: WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT IS INTIMIDATING.
>> COME ON, JON, YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET OLD WHITE LADY, JON.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, LARRY.
ON THE OFF CHANCE YELLING DOESN'T WORK.
>> AGAIN, WE'RE DEALING WITH THE ELDERLY.
THEY DON'T SEE SO WELL SO YOU CAN ALWAYS USE THE ART OF DISGUISE.
>> Jon: OH, YEAH, RIGHT, THE ART OF DISGUISE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE -- HEY, WHERE'D
LARRY GO.
I WAS JUST TALKING TO LARRY ABOUT VOTER FRAUD.
>> WHAT LARRY?
I'M LUIGI, I WANT MY BALLOT AND SOME DINNER!
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY, I'LL TRY TO FIND A BALLOT FOR YOU -- OH, GEEZ!
LARRY!
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, I WAS JUST TALKING WITH AN ASIAN GENTLEMAN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WAS MY ACCENT THAT BAD?
>> Jon: IT WAS TERRIBLE.
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD STICK WITH INTIMIDATION.
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
GET ME ANOTHER BALLOT, I (BLEEP)ED THIS ONE UP!
(LAUGHTER) LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
