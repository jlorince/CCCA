INVISIBLE.
WELL, WE COULD GO ON LIKE
THIS ALL DAY.
FOR MORE ON THE NEWT
GINGRICH OPEN MARRIAGE
CORRESPONDENT-- BOMBSHELL WE
TURN TO JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN, THIS NEWS, IT'S REALLY
BAD TIME, THE NEW BREAKS
JUST AS GINGRICH WAS GAINING
MOMENTUM IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
DOES THIS PUT A STOP TO
GINGRICH'S MOMENTUM.
>> NOT AT ALL, JON.
THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE,
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THIS.
>> Jon: NO IT'S ABOUT THE
HYPOCRISY, JOHN.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
LOOK AT THIS.
>> WE SHOULD REESTABLISH THE
IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY.
>> SAFEGUARD THE SANCTITY OF
MARRIAGE.
>> THE REPUBLICAN COMMITMENT
TO THE VALUES OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> I THINK THAT FOR MOST
AMERICANS, DEFENDING
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS A
LEGITIMATE PART OF THEIR
VALUE SYSTEM.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T THINK THAT
THAT HURTS SOMEONE WHO
PORTRAYS THEMSELVES AS A
CHAMPION OF TRADITIONAL
MARRIAGE?
>> JON WHAT COULD BE MORE
TRADITIONAL THAN THE
ARRANGEMENT THAT GINGRICH
PROPOSED.
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, JON,
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE HAVE
MEANT POWERFUL MEN DOING
WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THEY
WANT, WHENEVER THE [BLEEP]
THEY WANT TO.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THIS WILL
DEFINITELY HURT HIM IN THE
STATE OF FLORIDA WHICH IS
NEXT F BOCA IS ANY
INDICATION THAT PLACE IS A
HOT BED OF AGGRIEVED FIRST
WIVES.
>> AGAIN, AGAIN, ARE YOU
WRONG, JON, YOU'RE SIMPLY
WRONG, GINGRICH CAN SIMPLY
MAKE THE CASE, DON'T LOOK AT
WHAT I DID, LOOK AT THE
SKILL IT TOOK ME TO DO IT.
WITH WASHINGTON HOPELESSLY
GRIDLOCK HE REQUEST SELL HIS
AUDACITY AS A NEGOTIATING
STRENGTH.
DOW REALLY THINK THE CHINESE
WANT TO GO TOE-TO-TOE ON
DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WITH A GUY
WHO TRIED TO GET HIS
RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WIFE TO
SWING?
NO WAY!
THE CHINESE DON'T STAND A
CHANCE IN THOSE TALK, JON.
THEIR CULTURE IS BASED ON
SHAME AND NEWT GINGRICH HAS
NON.
>> Jon: I SEE.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE-- CHERS
PLAUS.
>> Jon: YOU REALLY BELIEVE
HE CAN USE THIS NEWS TO HIS
ADVANTAGE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
LOOK AT THE FACTS.
THIS EMOTIONALLY AND
PHYSICALLY REPUGNANT MAN.
>> Jon: OF COURSE.
>> WHO ON HIS BEST DAY
PLACES IN A QUITE SCHRUTE
LOOK ALIKE CONTEST, AND WHO
ON HIS WORST DAY RAMPAGES
THROUGH THE CITY OF NEW YORK,
HAS SOMEHOW, JON, SOMEHOW
LIKE A JUDO MASTER CHANNELED
HIS WEAKNESSES INTO
STRENGTHS.
AND HAS BEEN CUTTING A
[BLEEP] PATH THROUGH AMERICA.
>> AND SO IT IS YOUR
ESTIMATION NO DAMAGE HE
EMBRACES THIS.
>> AND THAT IS CERTAINLY
TRUE IF HIS NEW CAMPAIGN
SHOWS ANY INDICATION.
HE'S ALREADY DONE T JON.
HE'S ALREADY THERE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JON,
