[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
YOU KNOW AMERICA HAS IN MY MINDA LONG TRADITION OF POLITICAL
ATTACK ADS.
IN THE 2010 WEST VIRGINIA SENATERACE DEMOCRAT JOE MANCHIN TOOK
THE ATTACK AD CONCEPT TO ASOMEWHAT MORE LITERAL LEVEL,
USING A DEAD BOLT RIFLETO MURDER A COPY OF THE
FEDERAL CAP AND TRADE BILL.BY THE WAY, THE BILL NOW OF
COURSE RESIDES ABOVE SENATORMANCHIN'S FIREPLACE.
OF COURSE, LIKE ANY VISIONARYMANCHIN HAS HAD HIS IMITATORS.
>> GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE.WE DON'T WANT IT.
WE DON'T NEED IT. WECAN'T AFFORD IT.
THIS IS WHAT I DO TO THAT LAW.
PULL.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THAT IS SO PRIMAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT DOES HE DO TO BILLS HE
LIKES?
[LAUGHTER]REALLY NOT SURE WHAT THAT WAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]I THINK THESE GENTLEMAN MAY HAVE
A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDINGOF HOW LEGISLATION WORKS.
A LAW ISN'T LIKE A HORCRUX FROMHARRY POTTER WHERE
IF YOU DESTROY IT THE THING ITREPRESENTS IS GONE FOREVER.
THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG HOLE INTHE SYSTEM I SPILLED COFFEE ONTHE
13th AMENDMENT.
BLACK PEOPLE ARE SLAVES AGAIN.
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
BUT NOW WE'RE HEADING INTO THE2014 MID TERM CAMPAIGN SEASON.
I WONDER IF WE'LL SEE BILLSHOOTING ADS THAT SOMEHOW
OUT (bleep) THE PREVIOUS ONES.
>> THIS IS WILL BROOKE. WE'REDOWN HERE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN
TODAY AND TALK ABOUT TWOSERIOUS TOPICS, THE SECOND
AMENDMENT AND SEE HOW MUCHDAMAGE WE CAN DO TO THIS COPY OF
OBAMACARE.
>> Jon: OH SCARY. A HANDGUN.C'MON YOU'RE
TRYING TO KILL OBAMACARE OR GIVEIT  A FLESH WOUND?
[LAUGHTER]I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WEREN'T DONE
YET.
♪ [LAUGHTER]
HOLY (bleep).
WHEN DID OPPOSING HEALTH CAREREFORM BECOME THE SUNNY DEATH
SCENE FROM THE GODFATHER?
THESE CANDIDATE SHOOTS A LAW ADSARE LIKE DIE HARD SEQUELS. EACH
ONE IS GOING TO BE CRAZIERAND MORE DESPERATE THAN THE
LAST. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINEWHAT COULD COME NEXT.
WELL, NOT THAT HARD.
>> HI THERE, I'M WILSHIREJESSUP, AND I'M HERE TO TALKTO YOU
ABOUT TWO THINGS, AMERICA ANDDOING WEIRD (bleep) TOOBAMACARE.
♪ >> YOU CAN PRAY FOR A QUICK
REPEAL BUT YOU AIN'T GONNA GETIT.
♪ I'M SO SCARED I FALL OFF MYCHAIR AND I'M WONDERING HOW I'LL
GET DOWN THE STAIRS ♪♪
AT LEAST SOMEBODY IS CUTTING
EARMARKS.
[LAUGHTER]♪ STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU
>> I'LL WILLSHIRE JESSUP ANDI'LL (bleep) ANY BILL OBAMA
PASSES.
PAID FOR BY CITIZENS AGAINSTPAPER. VIEWS EXPRESSED ARE
SOLELY THOSE OF WILSHIRE JESSUP.TARANTINO,
IF YOU TRY TO SUEME, YOU WILL FAIL.
I'M BROKE AND PAYING CHILDSUPPORT FOR THREE SEPARATE
WOMEN. NOT AFFILIATED WITHNAPALM AGAINST OBAMACARE.
