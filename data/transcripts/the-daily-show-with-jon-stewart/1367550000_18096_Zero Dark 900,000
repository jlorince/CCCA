BEEN STUCK ON ENDLESS CALLS
TO THE VA FIGHTING FOR THEIR
RIGHTS.
IF I WAS GOING TO HELP, I'D

GREATEST PAPER HUNT OF ALL
TIME.

I PUT IN VA MEDICAL CLAIMS
FOUR TIMES AND THEY HAVE
LOST THEM THREE OUT OF FOUR
TIMES.

CLAIM HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN
IN PROGRESS.
>> ABOUT 330 DAYS.
>> SHE TOLD MY WIFE THAT THE
VA FORMS ARE IN A PILE, A
PHYSICAL PILE.

USE COMPUTERS, THE VA USE
PILE-BASED TECHNOLOGY.

GOING TO FIND YOUR CLAIM.

SMOLDERER, I'M DOING DRAMA.

ONLY ON PAPER, PEAKING IT
IMMUNE TO OUR ADVANCED
HACKING TECHNOLOGY.

NERD.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
OH, OH.
[BLEEP], OH.

IN THE MOUNTAINS OF
PAPERWORK, BUT IT COULD HAVE
ESCAPED TO THE MANHATTAN
REGIONAL OFFICE OR MAYBE
D.C..

>> CAN WE GET THE LIGHT DOWN
PLEASE.
HELLO AS A VETERAN'S
ADVOCATE FOR THE IAVA HE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US
WHERE TO LOCATE MANNING'S
MISSING CLAIMS FORM.
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT'S LIKE
FINDING A NEEDLE IN A
HAYSTACK.
>> WHEN WILL THE VA BE
ON-LINE.
>> I HAVE BEEN HEARING IT
WILL BE NEXT YEAR FOR THE
LAST THREE YEARS.
>> HAS ANYONE EVER FOUND
HIGH VALUED TARGET LIKE THIS
AT THE VA?
>> THEY HAVE A VETERAN WHO
IS WITH ME IN D.C. A FEW
WEEKS AGO.
HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR A
YEAR.
HE WENT ON TELEVISION AND
TOLD HIS STORY AND LOW AND
BEHOLD THE NEXT DAY HIS
CLAIM WAS FIXED.

ACTION.
