[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
OCCASIONALLY, OCCASIONALLY WE
STUMBLE UPON STORIES OF VALOR
AND COURAGE THEY HAVE TO BE
TOLD.
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
JASON JONES HAS MORE.
>> CYBER BULLYING IS A GROWING
EPIDEMIC AND FOR MICHIGAN
RESIDENT ANDREW SHERVIL IT'S A
NIGHTMARE.
>> PEOPLE TELLING ME I SHOULD BE
ELECT KAOUTD, WATERBOARDED
THROWN IN JAIL.
THERE'S NO DECENCY IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> THESE INDECENT ATTACKS CAME
BECAUSE HE WATCHED A HARMLESS
BLOG.
>> I STARTED THE WATCH IN LATE
APRIL BECAUSE I WAS VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT CHRIS'S ELECTION
AS THE STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
>> THE STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT?
>> CORRECT.
>> SO YOU STARTED A BLOG TO KEEP
TRACK OF HIM --
>> WELL BASICALLY KEEP TABS ON
WHAT POLICIES WERE GOING ON.
>> YES, IT'S JUST A 30-YEAR-OLD
MAN'S BLOG WITH POST AFTER POST
AFTER POST AFTER POST ABOUT ONE
SINGLE COLLEGE KID EXPOSING HOW
HE IS A PRIVILEGED PERVERT AND
GAY AND SOME SORT OF GAY NAZI.
>> HE IS A RADICAL HOMOSEXUAL
ACTIVIST PROMOTING AN AGENDA
THAT IS OPPOSED TO THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.
>> I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN TO SEE HOW ARMSTRONG'S
GAY AGENDA HAD DESTROYED THIS
ONCE PROUD INSTITUTION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HERE AT
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN?
>> I'M A THEATER DESIGN MAJOR.
DO YOU LIVE HERE OR YOU -- AH --
ARE YOU A LESBIAN?
IT WAS WORSE THAN SHERVILLE
DESCRIBED BUT HE IS TAKING A
STAND.
>> I'M DIGGING UP INFORMATION
THAT OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT.
IF THEY DON'T LIKE YOUR OPINION,
THEY WANT YOU JAILED.
THEY WANT YOU BASICALLY THROWN
UNDER THE BUS.
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS
THAT YOU ARE THE ONE DOING
HARASSING.
>> I'M EXERCISING MY FIRST
AMENDMENT.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT -- THIS IS
ABOUT A BROADER -- I THINK THEY
ARE FOCUSING ON ME BECAUSE I'M A
RIGHT-WING GUY.
AND OH, OH, HE'S PROLIFE.
HE HOLDS UP PICTURES AFTER BORED
BABIES.
HE'S SOME KIND OF LACK -- HE'S
CATHOLIC.
>> HAVE YOU SOUGHT LEGAL
PROTECTION FROM THIS CYBER
BULLYING.
>> HOW CAN YOU SEEK PROTECTION
FROM CRAZY PEOPLE?
>> FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE?
>> I HAVEN'T PURR SUED ANYTHING
YET.
>> FORTUNATE LE LIVED IN
MICHIGAN WHERE THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL MADE CYBER BULLYING A
TOP PRIORITY.
WE ASKED HIM TO HELP SHERVIL BUT
HE WAS TOO BUSINESSY SO WE SAT
DOWN WITH THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY
GENERAL.
>> YOU ARE THE ASSISTANT
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
>> YOU WORK WITH COX?
>> I CAN TELL YOU FROM BACK
GROUND PURPOSES I'M
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL.
>> HE WAS JUST THE MAN TO HELP
OUT CYBER PULLY VICTIM ANDREW
SHERVIL.
>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT
INVOLVES REPEATED TEXT
MESSAGING, PHONECALLS, E-MAILS.
>> TECHNOLOGY USED TO SHAH RAS
OR EMBARRASS -- HARASS OR
EMBARRASS?
>> THAT'S TOO BROAD OF A
DEFINITION.
>> THAT'S THE STATE'S
DEFINITION.
>> THAT'S NOT THE STATE'S
DEFINITION.
>> I HAVE THE PARENTS GUIDE TO
CYBER BULLYING ATTORNEY GENERAL.
>> IT'S TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.
>> I'M JUST READING IT AND IT
SAID NOTHING.
>> I'VE DONE NOTHING IMMORAL OR
ILLEGAL.
>> IS THIS IMMORAL?
>> NO, THAT'S NOT IMMORAL.
HOW IS THAT IMMORAL.
>> LIKENING SOMEONE TO A --
>> HE'S ACTING LIKE A GAY NAZI,
YES.
>> LIKE ANY BONA FIDE TPHADZ ZI
HUNTER HE HAS TRACKED DOWN
LEGIONS OF OTHERS IN LOCKSTEP
WITH CHRIS ARMSTRONG.
>> I KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED
TO ME THAT HE HAS BEEN SEXUALLY
ACTIVE WITH SEVERAL STUDENTS.
>> SEVERAL BOYFRIENDS?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE INTIMATE
DETAILS.
>> YOU REPORT ABOUT THE SECRET
GAY BOYFRIEND.
>> RIGHT.
>> HE UNEARTHED THIS PHOTO AS
IRREFUTABLE PROOF OF AT LEAST
ONE INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP.
THAT'S AN ESTIMATE.
I DON'T KNOW EVERYBODY'S
PERSONAL BACKGROWNS.
I HAVEN'T INVESTIGATED THAT.
I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN
WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING.
>> UNLESS THEY ARE ON FACEBOOK
AND THEY POST COMMENTS ABOUT
ARMSTRONG'S DORM PARTIES WHICH
HE SAYS ARE REALLY JUST GAY
ORGIES.
ORGY ATTENDEE THOMAS WALSH.
>> I DON'T WANT TO POINT FINGERS
BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS HE MIGHT
HAVE GOTTEN WRONG.
>> LIKE WHAT?
>> THE ENTIRE ORGY.
DID NOT HAPPEN.
>> WHAT HAPPENS AT THESE
PARTIES?
>> THERE'S MUSIC, DANCING
CHATTING, SNACKING IS A BIG PART
OF IT.
>> WHAT KIND OF GAY EUPHEMISM IS
THAT?
>> IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU TAKE FOOD
AND YOU PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND
CHEW IT AND INTALO IT FOR
NUTRITION.
>> I BET YOU SWALLOW IT.
DESPITE BEING LEGALLY PROHIBITED
FROM STEPPING FOOT ON THE CAMPUS
HE VOWS TO BRING THE CYBER
BULLIES TO JUSTICE.
>> LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS
WAY, JASON, THEY'LL TRY WHATEVER
IT WORKS TO MAKE THIS BLOG GO
DOWN.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM TRY
TO MAKE -- TAKE IT DOWN.
>> OH...
