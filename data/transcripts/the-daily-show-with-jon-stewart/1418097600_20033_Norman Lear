HOW -- FIRST OF ALL, YOU -- KIDSTODAY, THEY HAVE EVERYTHING
AT THEIR FINGERTIPS.
THEY CAN DOWNLOAD THINGS,THEY HAVE IT.
THEY CAN WATCH THINGS WHENTHEY WANT.
ALL IN THE FAMILY, MAUDE,THE JEFFERSONS, THIS WAS
APPOINTMENT TELEVISION.
I CAN REMEMBER AS A KID, THEANTICIPATION AND EXCITEMENT
WHEN YOUR SHOWS WERE GOINGTO BE COMING ON.
YOU OWNED TELEVISION BACKTHEN.
>> I WAS WORKING AS HARD ASYOU WORK TODAY.
>> Jon: NO.
>> NO TRULY, THAT'S WHAT WEWERE DOING.
WE WERE ALL WORKING OURASSES OFF.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> TO MAKE THE BEST TELEVISIONWE THOUGHT WE COULD.
THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT WEWERE ALL SERIOUS PEOPLE.
COMEDY WAS OUR BUSINESS.
YOU'RE A VERY SERIOUS MAN.
THAT WAS A VERY SERIOUS,HILARIOUS PIECE.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT'S VERY KINDOF YOU, SIR. I APPRECIATE THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT THAT'S WHERE, WHERE I THINK
I LEARNED HOW TO PROCESSCOMPLEX THOUGHTS, THINGS
THAT I REALLY CARED ABOUT,THROUGH THE LENS OF COMEDY
WAS WATCHING NORMAN LEARSHOWS.
BECAUSE THAT'S-- AND AT THATTIME IT WAS ASTONISHING.
I MEAN AT THAT TIME IT WASTHE BANANA SPLITS AND THE
HUDSON BROTHERS.
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDENARCHIE BUNKER COMES ON THE
SCENE AND ALL IN THE FAMILY,AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES
UNDERLYING THE AMERICANCULTURE CAME RIGHT OUT.
>> WHAT COULD MAKE MEPROUDER THAN TO HAVE SAT
THROUGH THOSE LAST FEW-- IHAVE TO REPEAT IT AGAIN.
THAT WAS SO BRILLIANT.
>> Jon: OH, THANK YOU.
WHEN YOU, BUT YOU STRUGGLED,THOUGH, FOR A WHILE, RIGHT?
LIKE YOU -->>I HAD  A LOT OF YEARS OF
STRUGGLING.
>> Jon: RIGHT. TELL ME ABOUTTHAT.
WHAT WAS IN YOUR MIND, DIDYOU THINK I'M GOING THE
WRONG DIRECTION HERE.
DID YOU THINK PEOPLE DON'TWANT TO HEAR THESE TYPES OF
ISSUES THROUGH A NARRATIVE?
>> YOU KNOW, I DID, THE FIRSTBIG BREAK, ED SIMMONS AND I HAD
WAS THE DEAN MARTIN AND JERRYLEWIS COLGATE COMEDY HOUR.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> ON THE COLGATE COMEDY HOURIT DEBUTED. AFTER THE SHOW
I WAS HAVING DINNER WITH MYAGENT AND HIS WIFE.
AND I WAS CRYING BECAUSEJERRY LEWIS HAD DESTROYED
THE SCENE, I THOUGHT, THATWE HAD WRITTEN FOR HIM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PAYATTENTION-- OR HE DID PAY
ATTENTION TO THE SCRIPT BUTHE LEFT THE SCRIPT OFTEN.
NOW WE WE WROTE A SCENE THATHAD SOME MEANING FOR US, AND
THAT'S WHY I WAS CRYING.
BUT HE DELIVERED THE SCENESO WELL, THAT THEY HAD TO
APOLOGIZE TO THE MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY, BECAUSE
THIS WAS A SCENE ABOUTTELEVISION DESTROYING THE
MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY.
AND THEY MADE A PUBLICAPOLOGY.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> YES, AT THE INSISTENCE OFTHE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY.
AND OUR SCENE HAD SCORED.
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ONOUR MINDS AT THE VERY FIRST
BEGINNING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AT THE VERY FIRST, MYCAREER.
>> Jon: IS THATSOMETHING-- SO YOU WENT INTO
THIS VERY CONSCIOUSLYDECIDING THAT YOU WEREN'T
JUST GOING TO WRITE ANY KINDOF COMEDY, YOU WERE GOING TO
WRITE SOCIAL COMEDY.
>> I DIDN'T GO INTO IT WITHTHAT.
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVEASSUMED I HAD SOME CONSCIOUS
OF FORETHOUGHT.
>> Jon: I GET IT, ALL RIGHT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
FAIR ENOUGH.
FIRST NIGHT "ALL IN THEFAMILY" COMES ON, THIS IS
GROUND BREAKING TELEVISION.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHAT WAS YOUREXPECTATION OF WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN WHEN THIS ARCHIEBUNKER CHARACTER, THIS
PLAIN-SPOKEN, LOVABLE BIGOTGETS INTO AMERICAN
TELEVISION LIVING ROOMS.
WHAT WAS THE NETWORK WORRIEDABOUT?
WHAT WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
>> WELL, THE NETWORK WASWORRIED ABOUT-- IT WAS 20
MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOW WENTON THE AIR.
>> Jon: UH-HUH.
>> IN NEW YORK WHEN I GOT ACALL THAT THEY WERE PUTTING
THE SHOW ON AIR.
BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE LINETHAT THEY WISHED OUT.
THE BUNKERS ARE RETURNINGFROM CHURCH BECAUSE HE HATED
THE SERMON AND HE HATED THE PASTOR.
AND THE KIDS HAVE THE HOUSEALONE, MIKE AND GLORIA AND
THEY'RE GOING UPSTAIRS.
THEY COME IN AND INTERRUPTTHAT.
AND ARCHIE SAYS, HE GETSWHAT'S HAPPENING, THE
MEANING OF WHAT ISHAPPENING.
AND HE SAYS 11:10 ON ASUNDAY MORNING.
THAT WAS IT.
>> Jon: OH MAN.
>> THAT HAD TO COME OUT.
NOW WHEN I SAID WHY?
THEY SAID IT MAKES IT VERYEXPLICIT.
THE "IT" MAKES IT-- 11:10 ONA SUNDAY MORNING, THAT NAILS
WHAT THEY'RE HAVING-- WELL,LET THAT BE.
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THATTHEY'RE MARRIED?
THEY'RE GOING UPSTAIRS,THEY'RE MARRIED.
>> Jon: YES.>> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
>> Jon: MARRIED PEOPLE AREALLOWED TO HAVE SEX IN THE
MORNING.
>> I THINK SO.
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD FOR THEM.
ANYWAY, THEY INSISTED THATTHAT COME OUT.
NOW IT SOUNDS, I DON'T MEANIT AS A TRIBUTE TO BRAVERY
AT ALL.
I HAD THE COMMON SENSE TOUNDERSTAND THAT THAT LITTLE
THING, IF I GIVE UP ON THATLITTLE THING, I WAS DEAD
FROM THERE ON.
THEN NO MATTER WHAT CRAZY,SILLY THING.
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUSTPLAIN SILLY.
I ALSO HAD A THREE PICTUREDEAL OFFERED TO ME BY UNITED
ARTISTS.
>> Jon: SO YOU HAD A LITTLESOMETHING-- YOU HAD A LITTLE
FALLBACK.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WELL, IT'S A VERYEXCITING.

>> I WOULD LOVE TO.
>> Jon: ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING HAVENORMAN LEAR STICK AROUND.
