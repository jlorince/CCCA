>> Jon: THAT'S CRAZY.WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE HERE WITH SENATORELIZABETH WARREN.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IWANT TO,
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A HUGE THINGON THIS STUDENT LOAN THING.
WHAT I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN TO MEBECAUSE THIS IS WHERE I,
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CBOACCOUNTING AND FAIR VALUE
ACCOUNTING.
WHAT IS -- WHAT'S THEDIFFERENCE -- BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE INTHE WORLD TO STUDENT LOANS SO
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE AND ISTHERE A DIFFERENCE?
>> SO THE QUESTION IS RIGHT NOWIN WASHINGTON HOW YOU DO THE
ACCOUNTING FOR ANYTHING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHERE YOU SPEND MONEY ORWHERE YOU'VE GOT MONEY
COMING IN.
>> Jon: SO WE CANNOT AGREE ONSCIENCE, POLICY AND NOW MATH.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. AND NOWMATH.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> AND HERE'S WHY IT MATTERSSO MUCH ON STUDENT LOANS.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> THE INTEREST RATE ON STUDENTLOANS DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU TOOK
YOUR LOAN OUT.
AND SO THERE ARE FOLKS OUTTHERE WHO HAVE LOANS AT 6%, 8%,
10%, EVEN HIGHER. THERE'SABOUT --
>> Jon: RIGHT. BECAUSE BACK THENTHE INTEREST RATES WERE HIGHER,
INFLATION WAS HIGHER AND --
>> WELL, EVEN NOW THE INTERESTRATE ON STUDENT LOANS THAT GOES
OUT, DEPENDING ON THEKIND OF LOAN YOU HAVE, IS PRETTY
SUBSTANTIAL.
WE'RE IN A LOW INTEREST RATEENVIRONMENT.
YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME.
YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR BUSINESSLOANS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT YOU CAN'T REFINANCEYOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT,
AND THEREASON YOU CAN'T REFINANCE YOUR
STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS BECAUSE THEGOVERNMENT WON'T LET YOU.
THEY WON'T REFINANCE IT.
THEY KEEP YOU LOCKED INTO THEINTEREST RATE YOU'VE GOT.
>> Jon: WHEN IT WAS THE TIME. SOYOU WIN IF YOU LOCK IN NOW AND
IT GOES UP.
>> BUT,  YEAH BUT HERE'S THETRICK ON THAT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> THE STUDENT LOAN INTERESTRATES ARE SET SO THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISMAKING MONEY OFF THEM.
THE LOANS, FOR EXAMPLE, JUSTFROM 2007 TO 2012, JUST THAT
SLICE OF LOANS -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IS ON TARGET RIGHT NOW TOPRODUCE ABOUT
$66 BILLION IN PROFITS FOR THEUNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: $66 BILLION JUST FROMTHAT.
NOW SEE THIS GETS INTO --
>> THAT'S AFTER THE BADDEBTS,
THAT'S AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVECOSTS.
>> Jon: NOW EXPLAIN TO ME WHATGOOD VALUE ACCOUNTING IS THOUGH
BECAUSE UNDER GOOD VALUEACCOUNTING THEY SAY THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LOSINGMONEY ON THOSE SAME LOANS.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> SO WHAT SOME FOLKS WANT TOSAY IS THAT IS OBSCENE FOR THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE DOINGTHAT.
I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO THINKSTHAT IS OBSCENE.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> SO THOSE WHO HAVE VOTEDAGAINST REDUCING THE INTEREST
RATE ON STUDENT LOANS SAY,WELL, IF WE USED A DIFFERENT
ACCOUNTING METHOD IT WOULDN'TLOOK LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
MAKES SO MUCH IN PROFIT. ANDTHAT WILL MAKE IT OKAY.
>> Jon: BUT WHAT IS THATACCOUNTING METHOD?
DID THEY JUST MAKE IT UP LIKEFOR INSTANCE LET'S TAKE OUT
$50 BILLION?
>> YES.
THAT IS A BIG PART OF IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THEY SAY LET'S ACCOUNT FORHOW THE GOVERNMENT'S MONEY WORKS
AS IF THE GOVERNMENT WERE APRIVATE COMPANY, EXCEPT THE
GOVERNMENT IS NOT A PRIVATECOMPANY, AND IT DOESN'T GET THE
SAME KIND OF RISK RATIO.
YOU KNOW, PRIVATE COMPANIESIF YOU ARE NOT A BIG BANK
CAN ACTUALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS.(LAUGHTER)
SO THERE'S A RISK FACTOR INACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES
THAT'S NOT THERE FOR THEGOVERNMENT, AND WHAT THE
REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED AGAINSTTHIS SAY AS WELL, IT WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BIG PROFIT IF YOU WOULDUSE A DIFFERENT FORM OF
ACCOUNTING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT KEEP THIS IN MIND ABOUTIT.
THE REAL KEY IS THAT IT PRODUCESTHESE PROFITS, THE CBO SAYS YEP,
THESE ARE THE PROFITS ITPRODUCES.
WHY CAN'T WE REDUCE THE INTERESTRATE?
WHY CAN'T WE JUST SAY LOOK,THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE
DOING AS A COUNTRY.
WE SHOULD NOT SAY TO KIDS IFYOUR MOM AND DAD COULD WRITE A
CHECK FOR COLLEGE YOU PAY THISMUCH FOR COLLEGE BUT IF THEY
CAN'T YOU'VE GOT TO PAY A MUCHHIGHER RATE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
TO PAY MORE ON YOUR STUDENTLOANS. WHY CAN'T WE REDUCE IT --
WOULDN'T THAT COUNT AS ECONOMICSTIMULUS, ANYWAY?
IF THE GOVERNMENT WASN'T GOINGTO GET IT DIRECTLY WOULDN'T
THAT MONEY BE FLOWING BACK INTOTHE ECONOMY IN OTHER WAYS?
>> LET'S SAY IT THAT WAY.
>> Jon: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> IF WE WOULD REDUCE THEINTEREST RATE ON STUDENT
LOANS -->> Jon: YES.
>> YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ALOT MORE MONEY TO SPEND.
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND THEN THEYCOULD BUY MORE WEED AND THEN
THEY'D BE QUIETER.(LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT WRONG ABOUT THAT.
>> BUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THECONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION
BUREAU AND THE FDIC ALSO POINTOUT THEY COULD BUY MORE HOMES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY COULD BUY MORE CARS,THEY COULD START MORE
BUSINESSES, THEY COULD DO MORETHINGS BOTH TO GET THEIR OWN
ECONOMIC LIVES STARTED AND TOKEEP THIS ECONOMY MOVING
FORWARD.
>> Jon: AND LET ME ASK YOUTHIS BECAUSE THE BIG BANKS HAVE
BEEN AT THE FED DISCOUNT WINDOWFOR YEARS AND YEARS BORROWING AT
ZERO%.>> YES.
>> Jon: NOW WHY IS THAT OKAY ANDWHY ISN'T THAT COSTING THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TONSOF MONEY BECAUSE THOSE
BANKS GO BACK AND BUY TREASURESWHICH EVEN IF THEY'RE
GETTING 2% OR 3% THE U.S.GOVERNMENT IS STILL USING
THAT MONEY, WHY AREN'T STUDENTSBEING PENALIZED FOR NOT BEING
BUSINESSES BUT BUSINESSES AREBEING BASICALLY HANDED MONEY.
>> BECAUSE THE BIG BANKS HAVE ALOT BETTER LOBBYISTS THAN THE
STUDENTS DO.
I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S WHAT ITCOMES DOWN TO.
>> Jon: THAT REALLY IS WHAT ITCOMES DOWN TO.
>> WE SHOULD NOT BE CHARGING OURKIDS MORE TO GET A LOAN TO GO TO
COLLEGE THAN WE CHARGE BIGFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER
TO FINANCE THEIR BUSINESSES.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: NOW I UNDERSTAND IT.
I UNDERSTAND IT ALITTLE BETTER NOW.
>> YOU DO.
>> Jon: YOU SHOULD BE LIKE APROFESSOR.
>> IT JUST DOESN'T WORK OUT THATWAY.
>> Jon: YOU SHOULD TEACH ACLASS.
>> I'M GONNA DO IT!
>> Jon: YOU SHOULD TEACH ACLASS ON THIS TYPE OF THING.
"A FIGHTING CHANCE," IT'SON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.
