>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW  MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A VERY GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
MY GUEST -- OH, WE LOVE, WE LOVETHIS  LADY.
LENA DUNHAM IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM.
VERY TALENTED. VERY FUNNY.
BUT FIRST, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVEBEEN  READING ABOUT A RECENT
INCIDENT AT OUR WHITE HOUSE.
>> THE U.S. SECRET SERVICECAPTURED A MAN WHO HAS JUMPED
THE WHITE HOUSE FENCE ANDMADE IT INSIDE THE BUILDING.
A SPOKESMAN SAYS THE MAN WAS NOT ARMED.
HE WAS CAUGHT JUST AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE NORTH
PORTICO DOORS.
>> OH, THAT DOESN'T SOUND THATBAD. SOUNDS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE
OVERLY COMFORTABLE TOURISTPROBABLY LATE FOR THE TOUR.
OR PERHAPS THE SECRET SERVICE IS UNDERSELLING THIS
INCIDENT.
>> GONZALEZ ENTERED THE UNLOCKED FRONT DOOR OF THE
EXECUTIVE MANSION.
>> HE THEN RAN MORE THAN 30 FEET THROUGH THE ENTRANCE
HALL TO THE CROSS HALL.
>> GONZALEZ THEN OVERPOWERED AN AGENT AND RAN A HUNDRED
FEET INTO THE EAST ROOM.
>> WHERE COUNTLESS WHITE HOUSE RECEPTIONS AND PUBLIC
CEREMONIES ARE HELD, THAT INCLUDED PARTIES FOR HEADS OF
STATE.
EVEN FRANK SINATRA.
>> WAS CARRYING A THREE AND AHALF INCH KNIFE.
>> HAD 800 ROUNDS OF AMMO, TWO HATCHETS AND A MACHETE IN HIS
CAR.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: OH.
NOW YOU MAY WONDER HOW THEY KNEW WHAT WAS IN HIS CAR.
HE HAD THAT DECAL.
THAT'S HOW THEY, THEY'RE SOADORABLE. BUT, BY THE WAY,
THAT WAS A REALLY WEIRD SINATRAREFERENCE, NO?
I THINK KNOWING THAT THE LONG DECEASED OLD BLUE EYES HAD
BEEN IN THAT VERY ROOM REALLY BROUGHT HOME THE URGENCY OF
THE ATTACK.
HOW DID THIS INTRUDER GET SO FAR INTO THE WHITE HOUSE?
DON'T THEY HAVE, DON'T THEY HAVEGUARD DOGS  THERE.
>> THERE WERE A LOT OF OFFICERS THERE, AND THERE WAS
CONCERN THE DOGS MIGHT ATTACK THEM INSTEAD.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT IT
MAKES MORE SENSE WHEN YOU FIND OUT A LOT OF SECRET SERVICE
AGENTS ARE CATS.
(LAUGHTER)SO, SO, SO THE DOGS DID NOT GET
THE INTRUDER. DOTHEY HAVE ALARMS?
>> THERE'S AN ALARM BOX NEARTHE FRONT ENTRANCE THAT'S
SUPPOSEED TO ALERT GUARDS OF ANINTRUSION, BUT
APPARENTLY IT HAD BEEN GOING OFF A LOT, AND SO IT WAS ON MUTE
BECAUSE IT WAS BOTHERING STAFFERS.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
YOU CAN'T JUST TURN OFF THE ALARM BECAUSE IT'S IRRITATING.
THIS IS THE WHITE HOUSE.
NOT A '97 HONDA CIVIC THAT'SPARKED ON YOUR BLOCK AT 3:00 AM.
NOW IT WOULD BE ONE THING IFTHIS POSSIBLY LETHAL GAME OF
FREEZE TAG WAS A ONE OFF FLUKE.BUT, THANKS TO THE
SECRET SERVICE, THE PRESIDENT'SHAD A LOT OF CLOSE CALLS.
>> THE SECURITY GUARD WAS INAPPROPRIATELY TAKING PHOTOS
OF THE PRESIDENT INSIDE ANELEVATOR,
WHO TURNED OUT HAD A GUN.
>> THE U.S. SECRET SERVICEMISHANDLED A SHOOTING INCIDENT
AT THE WHITE HOUSE BACK IN 2011.
>> THE SEVEN SHOTS WEREN'T DISCOVERED FOR FOUR DAYS.
>> Jon: FOUR DAYS!
IT TOOK THE WHITE HOUSE ONLY A LITTLE LESS TIME TO FIND OUT
THEY'D BEEN HIT BY BULLETS THAN IT TOOK JAMES FRANCO TO
SAW OFF HIS OWN ARM.(LAUGHTER)
HIS OWN ARM! [ APPLAUSE ]
AND SO YESTERDAY THE HOUSEOVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT
REFORM COMMITTEECALLED SECRET SERVICE
DIRECTOR JULIA PIERSON TOTESTIFY ABOUT THESE ISSUES.
IT DID NOT GO WELL.
>> THE BULLETS WERE NOTDISCOVERED TO HAVE HIT THE
WHITE HOUSE IN REAL-TIME WITHIN A 24 HOUR OR GREATER
PERIOD BY THE SECRETSERVICE. YES OR NO, PLEASE.
>> THERE WAS REPORTS OF SHOTSBEING
FIRED IN PROXIMITY TO CONSTITUTION AVENUE.
>> YOU HAVE OFFICERS AT THEWHITE HOUSE DRAWING THEIR
WEAPONS BECAUSE THEYBELIEVE SHOTS WERE FIRED.
NOW GIVE ME ALL THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A VEHICLE BACKFIRE.
>> IN DOWNTOWN AREAS THERE IS SOUND ATTENUATION OFTEN TIMES --
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD A CAR BACKFIRE SIX TO EIGHT TIMES.
>> I DO NOT -->> I HAVE NEVER. HAVE YOU?
>> I'VE HEARD CARS BACKFIRE, BUTI DON'T THINK --
>> SIX TO EIGHT TIMES?
>> THE INITIAL SHOOTINGINCIDENT OCCURRED AT 9:30 AT
NIGHT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE ATNIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: SO THAT'S SECRET
SERVICE. THEY BELIEVED BASICALLYTHAT WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS
WHEN SOMEONE SHOOTS AT THE WHITEHOUSE AT NIGHT.
YOU CAN GET A FLASHLIGHT AND LOOK AROUND, OR ONLY HAVE A
PRESIDENT DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS.
I MEAN, IT'S DARK.
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SEND MYAGENTS OUT THERE?
THERE COULD BE A BOOGIE MAN, ANYTYPE OF GOBLIN OR GREMLIN.
IT'S VERY FRIGHTENING.
HERE'S HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL THESECRET SERVICE IS AT THIS POINT.
CONGRESS HAD TO HELP THEM COMEUP  WITH SOLUTIONS.
>> HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO LOCK THE FRONT DOOR OF THE
WHITE HOUSE?
>> HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THESE GUYS?
WE COULD EVEN PUT VEGETATIONBARRIERS, SIMPLE THINGS
LIKE HOW ABOUT SPANISH BAYONETS.
YOU JUMP THAT FENCE, AND YOU GET QUITE A GREETING WHEN YOU
HIT THE GROUND.
>> Jon: A LOCK, AND ALARMSYSTEM, OR SPIKY PLANTS.
YOU NEVER WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU ARE CHARGED
WITH GUARDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND YOU
COULD BE REPLACED BY A PLANT.
(LAUGHTER)BY THE WAY, FOR ANY OF YOU
OUT THERE WHO DID NOT KNOWWHAT A SPANISH BAYONET
WAS, AND THOUGHT GEEZ, WHYDON'T I LOOK THAT UP ON THE
URBAN DICTIONARY.
I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE.
SPANISH BAYONET IS WHEN "YOU TAKE YOUR PENIS AND PUT IT IN
A STAND AND STUFF TACO, YOU ADDYOUR DESIRED TACO FILLING, AND
THEN YOU FEED THE SPANISHBAYONET TO YOUR PARTNER."
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT,
WHOEVER WROTE THAT, YOU PROBABLY WON'T CLIMB HIS (BLEEP) FENCE.
ANY OTHER IDEAS FOR DETERING FENCE JUMPERS?
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE CONSIDERED SIMPLY ASKING
THAT A HIGHER FENCE BE BUILT?
ONE, THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD CURVE SO MAYBE YOU DAMAGE A
BODY PART IF YOU TRY TO GET OVER IT.
>> HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING?
THESE PEOPLE PUT THEY'RE DICKSIN TACOS.
THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF BODY PART DAMAGE.
MAYBE I'M BEING MORE DISMISSIVETHAN I SHOULD BE.
NOBODY ON THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED ANY TRULY TERRIBLE
IDEAS.
>> IT SHOULD BE OVERWHELMINGFORCE. IF A WOULD BE INTRUDER
CAN'T BE STOPPED BY A DOG ORINTERCEPTED BY A PERSON,
PERHAPS MORE LETHAL FORCE IS NECESSARY.
IF THEY WANT TO PENETRATE THAT, THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO PERHAPS BE KILLED.
THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE SHOULD BE SENDING EVERY SINGLE TIME.
>> Jon: OKAY. ANYONE HAVEANYTHING TO ADD TO
JUDGE DREDD'S PROPOSAL.
>> I WAS TRAINED IN THAT YOU ONLY USE AS MUCH FORCE AS IT
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SUBDUE OR FIX THE PROBLEM.
NEVER ANY MORE UNDO FORCE.
>> THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SHOOT-OUT ON THE
WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS SEEMS TO ME A LAST RESORT, NOT A FIRST
RESORT.
>> YOU'VE HEARD MANY MEMBERS BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THOUGHT
THAT WE WOULD HAVE SORT OF A SHOOT TO KILL FIRST, AND
, OF COURSE, I THINK ABOUT EARLIER -- I THINK IN THIS YEAR
WE HAD A TODDLER BREACH THE FENCE.
>> Jon: TAKE THE SHOT.
I SAID TAKE THE SHOT.
I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THE TARGET IS CARRYING A DIRTY
BOMB IN HIS BOOM BOOM.
IN HIS BOOM BOOM!
