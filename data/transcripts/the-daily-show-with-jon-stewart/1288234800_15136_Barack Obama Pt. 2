I WANT THE TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A LIST OF
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT YOU FEEL
VERY PROUD OF THAT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE
RUNNING ON THE LIST OF
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
IF ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, I SAW A
COMMERCIAL FOR A GUY FROM WEST
VIRGINIA, MANCHIN, HE TOOK A
RIFLE AND SHOT THE CAP AND TRADE
BILL, AND I THOUGHT, OH, GOSH,
THE REPUBLICANS -- OH, THAT'S A
DEMOCRAT.
HAVE YOU CONVINCED YOUR OWN
PARTY THAT THE LEGISLATIVE
PROGRESS HAS BEEN ENOUGH, AND
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THEIR
REACTION TO IT?
>> LOOK, LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
>> Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO
CURSE?
>> NEW YORK I'M NOT GOING TO
CURSE.
( LAUGHTER )
I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS FEEL
FRUSTRATED ABOUT CONGRESS, HOW
IT OPERATES, THE BICKERING, THE
WEIRD RULES, THE FILIBUSTERS,
ALL THAT STUFF.
BUT THE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE A
BUNCH OF FOLKS WHO DURING THE
COURSE OF THIS YEAR TOOK REALLY
TOUGH VOTES THAT THEY KNEW WERE
BAD POLITICS BECAUSE THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE THE RIGHT
THINGS TO DO.
THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF
DEMOCRATS...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF
DEMOCRATS, GUYS LIKE TOM
PERRIOLO IN VIRGINIA BETSY
MARKEY IN COLORADO WHO ARE
BASICALLY IN REPUBLICAN
DISTRICTS, YOU KNOW, THEY WON IN
THE BIG SURGE THAT WE HAD IN
2008.
THEY KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A
TOUGH BATTLE, THAT THESE ARE
GENERALLY PRETTY CONSERVATIVE
DISTRICTS, AND YET THEY STILL
WENT AHEAD AND DID WHAT THEY
THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
AND MY HOPE IN THIS ELECTION IS
THAT PEOPLE WHO VOTE ON THE
BASIS OF WHAT THEY THINK IS
RIGHT AND HAVE INTEGRITY AND
AREN'T JUST THINKING ABOUT THE
NEXT ELECTION BUT ARE THINKING
ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION, THAT
THEY ARE REWARDED.
NOW, THAT'S TOUGH IN THIS
POLITICAL PROCESS BECAUSE YOU'VE
GOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF
INDEPENDENT MONEY THAT'S POURING
INTO THOSE RACES.
THEY ARE BEING HAMMERED BY
NEGATIVE ADS EVERY SINGLE DAY.
AND THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES:
DID THE MILLIONS OF VOICES WHO
CAME OUT IN 2008, WHO SAID FOLKS
WERE INTERESTED IN FIXING OUR
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WANTED A
SERIOUS ENERGY POLICY, WANTED
THE KINDS OF CHANGES IN OUR
STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM THAT HAVE
ALLOWED MILLIONS MORE KIDS TO
HAVE ACCESS TO COLLEGE, THAT'S
WHAT WE RAN ON, THAT'S WHAT WE
DELIVERED, AND MY HOPE IS THOSE
PEOPLE ARE REWARDED FOR TAKING
THOSE TOUGH VOTES.
IF THEY, ARE I THINK DEMOCRATS
WILL DO FINE ON ELECTION DAY.
>> Jon: IS THE DIFFICULTY THAT
YOU HAVE HERE THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN WHAT YOU RAN ON AND WHAT
YOU DELIVERED?
IS THAT... YOU RAN WITH SUCH,IF
I MAY, AUDACITY.
SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAID IS
GREAT LEADERS LEAD IN A TIME OF
OPPORTUNITY, WE'RE THE ONES
WE'RE LOOKING FOR, YET
LEGISLATIVELY IT HAS FELT TIMID
AT TIMES.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE AT TIMES WHAT
YOU WANT OUT OF A HEALTH CARE
BILL.
>> AND THIS IS, JON, I LOVE YOUR
SHOW, BUT...
>> Jon: VERY KIND OF YOU.
>> BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE,
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A PROFOUND
DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU AND I
DON'T WANT TO LUMP YOU IN WITH A
LOT OF OTHER PUNDITS, BUT THIS
NOTION...
>> Jon: YOU MAY.
>> NO, NO.
LOOK, THIS NOTION THAT HEALTH
CARE WAS TIMID.
YOU'VE GOT 30 MILLION PEOPLE WHO
ARE GOING TO GET HEALTH
INSURANCE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF
THIS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU HAVE A PATIENTS' BILL OF
RIGHTS THAT MAKES SURE THAT
INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN'T DROP
YOU WHEN YOU GET SICK IF YOU'VE
BEEN PLAYING PREMIUM, MAKE SURE
THERE AREN'T LIFETIME LIMITS,
MAKE SURE KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE
INSURANCE CAN STAY ON THEIR
PARENTS' HEALTH INSURANCE UNTIL
THEY'RE 26, AND IT CUTS THE
DEFICIT BY OVER $1 TRILLION.
THIS IS WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE
WOULD SAY IS AS SIGNIFICANT A
PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS WE'VE
SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY.
( APPLAUSE
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND THE NOTION THAT... BUT WHAT
HAPPENS... WHAT HAPPENS IS IT
GETS DISCOUNTED BECAUSE THE
PRESUMPTION IS, WELL, WE DIDN'T
GET 100% OF WHAT WE WANTED.
WE GOT 90% OF WHAT WE WANTED, SO
LET'S FOCUS ON THE 10% WE DIDN'T
GET AS OPPOSED TO THE 90% THAT
WE DID.
AND RIGHT NOW THERE IS A WOMAN
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO DOESN'T
HAVE TO SELL HER HOUSE TO GET
HER CANCER TREATMENTS BECAUSE OF
THAT HEALTH CARE BILL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND SHE DOESN'T THINK IT'S
INCONSEQUENTIAL.
SHE DOESN'T THINK IT'S TIMID.
>> Jon: THE SUGGESTION WAS NOT
THAT IT'S INCONSEQUENTIAL.
>> THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT IT
WAS TIMID.
>> Jon: TIMID.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN,
AND I DON'T MEAN TO LUMP YOU IN
WITH OTHER PRESIDENTS...
( LAUGHTER )
>> GOOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: BUT I THINK IF I WERE
TO TRY AND COALESCE WHATEVER
CRITICISM OF IT MAY BE, IT'S
THAT YOU RAN ON THE IDEA THAT
THIS SYSTEM NEEDED BASIC REFORM.
IT FEELS LIKE SOME OF THE
REFORMS THAT HAVE PASSED, LIKE
HEALTH CARE, HAVE BEEN DONE IN A
VERY POLITICAL MANNER THAT HAS
PAPERED OVER A FOUNDATION THAT
IS CORRUPT.
>> THAT I THINK IS FAIR, WHICH
IS... HERE'S WHAT I THINK IS
FAIR, THAT OVER THE LAST TWO
YEARS IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OUR BASIC ATTITUDE WAS, WE'VE
GOT TO GET SOME THINGS DONE.
>> Jon: UH-HUH.
>> IN SOME CASES QUICKLY, THAT
ARE... IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
BASICALLY WE WORKED WITH THE
PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO TRANSFORM
THE PROCESS.
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT
FRUSTRATED FOLKS.
IT FRUSTRATES ME.
LOOK, I WOULD LOVE NOT TO HAVE A
60-VOTE REQUIREMENT, WHICH IS
NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT IT
IS IN THE SENATE RULES RIGHT
NOW, THAT APPLY TO EVERYTHING WE
DO SO THAT I CAN'T GET A DEPUTY
SECRETARY OF TREASURY IN THE
MIDDLE OF FINANCIAL CRISIS
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S HOLDING IT
UP.
AND THEY'RE FILIBUSTERING THE
APPOINTMENT.
SO THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
THAT HAPPENED DURING THE COURSE
OF THESE TWO YEARS IN TERMS OF
PROCESS THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE
CHANGED.
KEEP IN MIND THAT THOSE AREAS
WHERE WE HAD CONTROL OVER
PROCESS, WE ACTUALLY MADE
CHANGES.
SO WE'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF
RULES ABOUT LOBBYISTS
INTERACTING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE
THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANY
WHITE HOUSE BEFORE.
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO COME TO
VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOW THAT
LIST IS GIVEN OUT TO EVERYBODY.
THAT'S A CHANGE.
BUT...
>> Jon: DID YOU JUST INVITE ME
TO THE WHITE HOUSE?
>> NO.
NO.
BECAUSE WE'D HAVE TO DISCLOSE
IT, AND I DON'T THINK...
EXACTLY.
>> Jon: LET ME EXPLAIN MORE
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I THINK
THAT TO SAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM,
WITHOUT THE SYSTEM, YOU KNOW, IN
THE HEALTH CARE BILL, YOU WORKED
WITHIN THE SYSTEM.
YOU KNOW, DURING THE CAMPAIGN
THERE WAS TALK THAT WE WOULD BE
ABLE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES WITH
CANADIAN PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES.
A DEAL WAS MADE WITH THEM, $80
BILLION OVER TEN YEARS.
THAT SEEMS LIKE A QUID PRO QUO.
BUT THERE'S OTHER THINGS WITH
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
I WAS TALKING WITH A WOMAN IN
THE AUDIENCE BEFORE THE SHOW.
( LAUGHTER )
SHEA -- SHE BROUGHT UP AN
INTERESTING POINT.
YOU KNOW, 2014 IS WHEN THESE
EXCHANGES KICK IN AND THERE WILL
BE SOME SORT OF PRICE COMES, BUT
UP UNTIL THAT POINT THERE'S
REALLY NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT
DOESN'T ALLOW THESE INSURANCE
COMPANIES TO RAISE RATES.
>> NOT TRUE.
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE HAVE
EMPOWERED STATE INSURANCE
COMMISSIONERS TO REVIEW THE RATE
HIKES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN
STATES, AND SOME STATES LIKE
NORTH CAROLINA HAVE ALREADY USED
IT AND ROLLED BACK PREMIUM
INCREASES BY 25%.
>> Jon: DOESN'T THAT ONLY TRIP
ON EGREGIOUS RAISES?
DON'T THEY KNOW IF YOU RAISE IT
30% SO THEY RAISE IT 29%?
IS THAT?
>> IF THE POINT, JON, IS THAT
OVERNIGHT WE DID NOT TRANSFORM
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, THAT
POINT IS TRUE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY, IT SEEMS SO PETTY.
>> WHEN I SAY THAT... WHEN WE
PROMISED DURING THE CAMPAIGN,
CHANGE YOU CAN BELIEVE IN.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT WASN'T CHANGE YOU CAN
BELIEVE IN, IN 18 MONTHS, IT WAS
CHANGE YOU CAN BELIEVE IN, BUT,
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO WORK FOR IT.
THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION...
LET ME MAKE THIS POINT BECAUSE I
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
LOOK, WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY WAS
PASSED, IT APPLIED TO WIDOWS AND
ORPHANS.
AND IT WAS A VERY RESTRICTED
PROGRAM.
AND OVER TIME THAT STRUCTURE
THAT WAS BUILT ENDED UP
DEVELOPING INTO THE MOST
IMPORTANT SOCIAL SAFETY NET THAT
WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY.
THE SAME IS TRUE ON EVERY PIECE
OF PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION,
EVERY BIT OF PROGRESS THAT WE'VE
MADE.
WHEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT
PASSED, THERE WAS STILL A BUNCH
OF FOLKS DOWN SOUTH WHO COULDN'T
VOTE, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE
THERE WERE A BUNCH OF
COMMENTATORS OUT THERE WHO SAID,
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS LAW IS NOT
DOING THE JOB.
THEY'RE THERE ARE STILL FOLKS
WHO AREN'T ABLE TO EXERCISE
THEIR FRANCHISE, BUT THE POINT
WAS THAT WE HAVE CREATED A
STRUCTURE.
WE HAVE PUT A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE
THAT ALLOWED US THEN TO CONTINUE
TO MAKE PROGRESS.
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE
LAST 18 MONTHS.
THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP ON DOING AS LONG AS I'VE
GOT THE CAPACITY TO DO IT, AS
LONG AS I'M PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, SIR.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL
BREAK.
