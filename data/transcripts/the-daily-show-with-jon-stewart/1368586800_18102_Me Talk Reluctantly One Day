>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW, THIS IS JON
STEWART.
BIG SHOW TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT TONY
NOMINEE NATHAN LANE WILL BE
JOINING US NOW ON BROADWAY
IN A PHENOMENAL PLAY, "THE
NANCE"
IT IS THE STORY OF CBS
SPORTSCASTER JIM NANCE AND
IT IS--
(LAUGHTER)
THAT JUST KILLED IN THE
PRESS BOX AT PATRIOT STADIUM
BUT OTHER THAN THAT-- WE
BEGIN TONIGHT IN WASHINGTON.
WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA FINDS
HIMSELF IN A VERITABLE SLUM
OF SCANDALS WHERE WITH THE
IRS TARGETING POLITICAL O
POINTS.
THE THE STATE DEPARTMENT
MANIPULATING POINT, THE POST
OFFICE SENDING PORNOGRAPHY
TO PEOPLE'S HOMES ADDRESSED
TO SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T EVEN
ORDER IT.
WHY WOULD I ORDER
PORNOGRAPHY, I MEANS
THAT'S-- THE LAST ONE IS
PROBABLY NOT AN
ADMINISTRATION SCANDAL, I
JUST FIND IT FRUSTRATING.
ALL RIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT WAS FORTUNATE
YESTERDAY THAT WHEN HE
APPEARED BEFORE THE PRESS,
HE WAS KPD BY BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER CAMERON.
AND A QUESTION LIMIT OF ONE.
TOTAL FROM THE ENTIRE
AMERICAN PRESS CORP. GIVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT, GUYS.
>> WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARN
THAT THE IRS WAS TARGETING
CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL GROUPS?
DO YOU FEEL THAT THE IRS
BETRAYED THE PUBLIC A TRUST
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
REPERCUSSIONS FOR THESE
ACTIONS SHOULD BE?
>> Jon: TECHNICALLY THAT WAS
THREE QUESTIONS.
BUT OBVIOUSLY ONE GENERAL
MILL LIKE TOOTHPASTE THAT
INCLUDES FLUORIDE AND WHITENER,
COMES OUT OF THE SAME TUBE
BUT PROVIDES TRIPLE
PROTECTION.
AQUAFRESH.
IT'S LIKE BRUSHING YOUR
TEETH WITH A COLOURFUL
ZEBRA.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, GREAT JOB.
WE'RE ON BASIC CABLE.
WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY.
GREAT JOB BY THAT INTREPID
REPORTER GETTING AN IRS
THREE-FER FOR THE ONE
QUESTION.
>> AND ON BENGHAZI-- .
>> Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]
SOMEBODY JUST ADDED TARTAR
CONTROL!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: TARTAR CONTROL,
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS ONE
DOESN'T CONTROL TARTAR.
LET'S TARTAR RUN ALL OVER
YOUR MOUTH.
>> FROM I WAS ALWAYS TOLD
THE WHOLE POINT OF
TOOTHPASTE WAS TO CONTROL
TARTAR BUT IN THE WORLD OF
AQUAFRESH IT IS A BON IS
STRIPE.
(LAUGHTER)
MY IMPRESSION OF THE
AQUAFRESH MARKETING
DEPARTMENT, SEND STEWART A
CARTON OF AQUAFRESH-- WAIT
WAIT-- ANYWAY.
THE POINT IS THE WHITE HOUSE
WAS NOT QUITE SO SUCCESSFUL
IN RESTRICTING THE FREEDOM
OF THIS PARTICULAR PRESS.
LET'S START WITH THE FIRST
QUERY, MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN
DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE
IRS TARGETING CONSERVATIVE
GROUPS?
>> I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT IT
FROM THE SAME NEWS REPORTS
THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE
LEARNED ABOUT THIS.
I THINK IT WAS ON FRIDAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NOTICE HE THOUGHT TO
RUN THAT UP THE FLAG POLE
LET'S SAY THE HEAD OF THE
IRS WHO HAS KNOWN ABOUT IT
AN YEAR.
THE FAVORITE PART WAS I
THINK IT WAS-- ON FRIDAY, I
THINK.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT WAS THAT DAY THAT I
FOUND OUT THAT THE IRS MAY
BE USING ITS POWER FOR
POLITICAL PURPOSES LET'S SEE
THAT WAS-- WELL, OH, THE
BEER SUMMIT WAS ON WEDNESDAY
AND THEN THURSDAY WAS
LISTENING TO AMERICAN PHONE
CALLS AND RANDOMLY FIRING
DRONE MISSILES WHERE.
WAS I WHEN I HEARD THE IRS
NEWS I WAS AT THE MOSQUE
PRAYING, SO YES, FRIDAY, I
THINK IT WAS FRIDAY.
(APPLAUSE)
BUT I GUESS I CAN BUY THAT
NOBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION
THOUGHT TO MENTION THIS
ISSUE TO THE PRESIDENT,
SLIGHT OVERSIGHT IT NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.
>> I HEARD ON THE NEWS ABOUT
THIS STORY THAT FAST AND
FURIOUS RZ IT HAPPENED ONE
OTHER TIME WITH THE FAST AND
FURIOUS, FAILED GUN TRACKING
OPERATION WHERE SOMEBODY
ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BRING DK --
INTO MEXICO TO SEE WHERE
THEY ENDED UP WHILE
FORGETTING TO FIND OUT WHERE
THEY ENDED UP.
>> IT WAS SOMETHING WE FOUND
OUT ABOUT A LONG WITH ALL OF
YOU RZ AND THAT OTHER TIME
WHEN AIR FORCE ONE DID AN
UNANNOUNCED POST 9/11 LOWER
MANHATTAN STATUE OF LIBERTY
FLY OVER FOR THIS SWEET OT
OWE-- PHOTO OP THAT IN NO
WAY COULD HAVE BEEN PHOTO
SHOPPED SAVE LOWER
MANHATTANITES TRAUMA RELATED
DIARRHEA.
>> WE DON'T HAVE ANY
INDEPENDENT KNOWLEDGE OF
THAT.
HE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT WITH
THE NEWS REPORTS YESTERDAY
ON THE ROAD RZ AND
YESTERDAY'S NEWS OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD
SEEN TWO MONTHS OF PHONE
RECORDS FROM AP REPORTERS.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
PRESIDENT OBAMA LEARNED
OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD BEEN
KILLED WHEN HE SAW HIMSELF
ANNOUNCING IT ON TELEVISION.
(APPLAUSE)
OH, WOW, WE DID THAT.
WHY DOESN'T ANYONE TELL ME
THESE THINGS.

WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO
