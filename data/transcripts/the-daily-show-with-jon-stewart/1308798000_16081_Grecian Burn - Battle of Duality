>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY.
GREECE.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S ME, JON.
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOUR
PROBLEM, IS JON.
YOUR GREEK SPIRIT IS CAUGHT IN A
BATTLE OF DUALITY, TORN BETWEEN
THE AGGRESSION AND TENACITY OF
THE SPARTANS VERSUS THE WISDOM
AND SOPHISTICATION AND
HOSPITALITY OF THE ATHENIANS.
AN EPIC STRUGGLE BETWEEN SPARTA
AND ATHEN, A PROFOUND 3,000-YEAR
INTERNAL STRUGGLE THAT WE HERE
IN AMERICA HAVE IN TURN MADE OUR
EXPERIENCE AT DINERS.
AND THIS GUY.
♪ HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY ♪♪
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT WORLD HISTORY, BUT GREECE,
TO SOLVE THIS YOU MUST OVERCOME
YOUR DUALITY.
RIGHT NOW WITH THE HITTING THE
POLICE WITH CLUBS AND YOGURT,
YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO SPARTAN.
RETIRING AT 53 WITH ALMOST FULL
PAY, A LITTLE TOO PLATO'S
RETREATY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I KNOW YOU CAN STRIKE THIS
BALANCE BETWEEN AUSTERITY AND
HEDONISM.
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE
STORY THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT
FIND APROPOS.
ONE DAY A GOD NAMED ZEUS LOOKED
DOWN UPON THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
FROM OLYMPUS AND THOUGHT, I WILL
TURN PIETION INTO -- MYSELF INTO
A BULL.
AS A BULL, HE WENT DOWN AMONGST
THE HUMANS AND [BLEEPED].
AND THAT'S WHY TODAY WE HAVE
COCONUTS.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHO CAME UP WITH THAT?
YOU DID.
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD LUCK.
