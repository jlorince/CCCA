(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER, I'M
STILL HERE FOR JON STEWART WHO,
DUE TO A COMICAL MIXUP, IS
CURRENTLY HOSTING "THE DOILY
SHOW" AMERICA'S GREATEST
SATIRICAL LACE CENTERPIECE
PROGRAM.
(LAUGHTER)
HE IS EVISCERATING THAT LACE
WORK AND THAT'S A DIRECT COPY
QUOTE.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS SENATOR
RAND PAUL, HE'S GOING TO BE WITH
US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE'S ALSO WHERE WE BEGIN
TONIGHT.
WHAT HAS SENATOR PAUL BEEN UP
TO?
>> SENATOR RAND PAUL OF KENTUCKY
HEADS TO IOWA.
>> HE HAS PLANNED TO VISIT SOUTH
CAROLINA AND NEVADA.
>> TOMORROW HE HEADLINES A
G.O.P. DINNER NEW HAMPSHIRE.
>> I KNOW RAND PAUL, I THINK
HE'LL RUN IN 2016.
>> WHAT STANDS BETWEEN THE PAUL
DYNASTY AND 2016?
>> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THE FIRST
THING THAT STANDS BETWEEN THEM,
THREE (BLEEP)ING YEARS!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S OVER 50 NEW IPHONES FROM
NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS
ELECTION?
THAT BRINGS US TO YET ANOTHER
INSTALLMENT OF "CAN'T YOU AT
LEAST WAIT UNTIL JON STEWART
COMES BACK?"
(LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY!
THIS IS MY LAST WEEK DOING THIS!
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE MEDIA IS
ALREADY RAMPING UP THEIR 2016
COVERAGE, IT'S THIS SOME OF THEM
ARE ALREADY TRYING TO WIND IT
DOWN.
>> I PREDICT THE HARD RIGHT IS
GOING TO TAKE OVER THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN 2016 AND THE
NOMINATION IS GOING TO RAND
PAUL.
YOU WATCH.
THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
>> Jon: OOH!
(LAUGHTER)
REALLY?
BECAUSE ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT
YOU WERE PAID TO SPIT ON A
CAMERA LENS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, LOOK, IF MAKING SOUND
PREDICTIONS IS WHAT CHRIS
MATTHEWS DOES FOR A LIVING THEN
HE MAY HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM
BECAUSE FINDING SOUNDBITES OF
PEOPLE SAYING THINGS THAT
DIRECTLY CONTRADICT THE CLAIM
THEY'VE JUST MADE, THAT'S WHAT
WE DO FOR A LIVING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, WHO
DID CHRIS MATTHEWS SEE GOING ALL
THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN
2008?
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT RUDY
GIULIANI.
I BELIEVE HE'S NOT ONLY RUNNING,
I THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN THIS
WHOLE THING COME AROUND THE NEXT
ELECTION.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
YOU REMEMBER HIM?
CURRENT PRESIDENT RUDY GIULIANI?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU REMEMBER THE FORMIDABLE
CONTENDER IN THE 2008 ELECTION
WHO WON IN THE PRIMARIES ONLY
ONE MORE DELEGATE THAN I DID.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT LOOK, LET'S BE FAIR.
THAT WAS A WHOLE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION AGO.
EVERYONE IS ALLOWED A MULLIGAN
AND MATTHEWS MADE UP FOR THAT BY
COMPLETELY NAILING HIS
PREDICTION FOR WHO WOULD WIN THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN 2012.
>> YOU WATCH BACHMANN.
SHE'S GOT THE ACTION THIS TIME.
SHE STANDS FOR SOMETHING --
SHE'S GOING ALL THE WAY.
SHE'S GOING TO WIN THIS THING.
>> REALLY?
>> I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.
I PREDICT SHE BEATS TRUMP.
>> John: IT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR A
LIVING.
(LAUGHTER)
IS HE A PSYCHIC OR A TIME
TRAVELER?
EITHER WAY, WE MUST BURN HIM AS
A WITCH.
CHRIS MATTHEWS DOESN'T JUST
ROUTINELY HAVE EGG ON HIS FACE,
HE HAS A CHICKEN COP AGO SQUAT
OVER HIS FACE, LAYING AN EGG
BETWEEN HIS EYES, (BLEEP)ING ON
THAT EGG
