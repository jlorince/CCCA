>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
TONIGHT JENNIFER ANISTON.
JENNIFER ANISTON WILL BE HERE.
I HOPE I'M NOT TOO EXHAUSTED.
I HAD A CRAZY WEEKEND.
YESTERDAY LIKE EVERY YEAR IN
THE END OF JUNE LAST WEEKEND I
DRESS IN GLITTER LIKE A
PEACOCK.
I MARCH DOWN FIFTH AVENUE TO
RAISE AWARENESS OF EXOTIC
BIRDS.
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THIS
YEAR ALMOST MORE THAN ANY
OTHER YEAR IT WENT REALLY
REALLY WELL.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE SUPPORT
I WAS GETTING.
PEOPLE ARE LIKE THIS IS A
GREAT DAY.
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
I WAS LIKE, YEAH, EXOTIC
BIRDS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
AND THEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE
WASN'T FRIDAY AMAZING?
I WAS LIKE WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY?
>> IT IS A HISTORY-MAKING
NIGHT WITH A VOTE THAT JUST
HAPPENED A SHORT TIME AGO.
NEW YORK BECOMES THE 7th
JURISDICTION IN AMERICA TO
RECOGNIZE MARRIAGE FOR SAME
SEX COUPLES.
>> Jon: THAT'S A MAJOR CIVIL
RIGHTS VICTORY.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NEW YORK, FINALLY, NEW YORK
STATE'S GAY AND LESBIAN
COMMUNITY ARE FREE FROM THE
BURDEN THAT WAS HAVING TO SET
FOOT IN CONNECTICUT IN ORDER
TO GET MARRIED.
( APPLAUSE )
REALLY?
THE NUPTIALS ARE IN STAM
FORWARD?
MMMM.
YES, IT WAS LAST FRIDAY NIGHT
AT 10:30 P.M. EASTERN GAY
RIGHTS TIME AFTER A WEEK OF
TENSE NEGOTIATIONS AND
PROTESTS FEATURING BRUTAL GAY
VERSUS JEW BULL FIGHTING, THE
SENATE IN AL BANY FINALLY MADE
AN HONEST STATE OF NEW YORK BY
A VOTE OF 33 FOR DESTROYING
SOCIETY AS WE KNOW IT AND 29
AGAINST.
THE VOTE WAS IN DOUBT RIGHT UP
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.
AS OF THURSDAY, THE STATE
SENATE WAS DEAD LOCKED 31-31.
MARRIAGE RIGHTS SUPPORTERS HAD
TO FIND AT LEAST ONE MORE
REPUBLICAN TO FLIP.
AND THEN UP STEPPED MARK
GRISANTI, STATE SENATOR FROM
BUFFALO, WHO HAD RUN ON A
PLATFORM OF BANNING GAY
MARRIAGE.
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> AS A CATHOLIC I WAS RAISED
TO BELIEVE THAT MARRIAGE IS
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.
>> Jon: SO WE'LL MOVE ON FROM
THERE.
MAYBE THEY'LL FIND A VOTE FROM
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T APPEAR TO
BE ON ELLIOTT NESS'S ENEMY
LIST.
>> I CANNOT LEGALLY COME UP
WITH AN ARGUMENT AGAINST SAME
SEX MARRIAGE.
WHO AM I TO SAY THAT SOMEONE
DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS
THAT I HAVE WITH MY WIFE WHO I
LOVE OR TO HAVE THE 1300-PLUS
RIGHTS THAT I SHARE WITH HER?
I VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE,
MR. PRESIDENT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SO IMPRESSED.
IN HONOR OF THIS MAN, IN HONOR
OF THIS GREAT MAN, I WILL NO
LONGER DO MY OFFENSIVE ITALIAN
NEW YORKER VOICE.
FOR AS LONG AS... BECAUSE IT'S
NOT OFTEN YOU SEE THIS SON OF
A B... THE COURAGE THAT THIS
MOTHER (BEEP), THE GIANT
(BEEP) HANGING OVER THIS MAN
LIKE BOCCE BALLS ON A SUMMER
AFTERNOON.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO DO THE
VOICE.
IT'S A VERY FUN VOICE.
SO WITH SUPPORT OF GRISANTI
AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICAN
STEVEN SALAN GAY MARRIAGE
PASSED AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW
WITH THAT MEANS.
>> THE CITY ESTIMATES THE NEW
LAW WILL BRING MORE THAN $180
MILLION TO THE STATE IN THE
NEXT THREE YEARS.
>> Jon: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
ALL RIGHT.
ALSO CASHING IN THE PERFECT
TIME TO ROLL OUT MY NEW JON
STEWART BRAND TUXEDOS.
ALL THE ELEGANCE OF A TUXEDO
BUT WITH THE FLATTERING
PHYSIQUE.
>> (CAT YOWLING).
>> Jon: INDEED.
FRAY FRY'S DECISION BRINGS THE
TOTAL NUMBER OF STATES
PERMITTING GAY MARRIAGE TO 7.
41 OTHER STATES STILL HAVE
LAWS ON THE BOOKS EXPLICITLY
BANNING SAME SEX MARRIAGE.
IT'S WHY MANY GAY ACTIVISTS
ARE LOOKING FOR FEDERAL ACTION
TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL MARRIAGE
EQUALITY.
LAST THURSDAY BARACK OBAMA
ADDRESSED THAT VERY QUESTION.
>> I HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT
THE SO-CALLED DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT OUGHT TO BE
REPEALED.
>> Jon: HEAR, HEAR, YEAH!
I ASSUME THE PRESIDENT'S
PROBLEM WITH THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT IS THAT IT SHOULD
BE A FEDERAL LAW IN SUPPORT OF
GAY MARRIAGE.
>> PART OF THE REASON THAT
DOMA DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IS
THAT TRADITIONALLY MARRIAGE
HAS BEEN DECIDED BY THE
STATES.
(AUDIENCE GROANING).
>> Jon: REALLY?
THE GENTLEMAN WITH MIXED RACE
PARENTS PLAYING THE STATES NO
BEST CARD.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS BORN...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHEN I WAS BORN MY PARENTS'
MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN
ILLEGAL IN FLORIDA AND
VIRGINIA.
SO
