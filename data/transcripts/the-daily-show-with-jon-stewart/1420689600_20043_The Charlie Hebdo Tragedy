[ Applause ]>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO
"THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME ISJON STEWART.
I'M EXCITED WE HAVE GOOD SHOWFOR YOU TONIGHT.
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT MYGUEST, "SELMA" DIRECTOR
AVA DUVERNAY, AND THIS MOVIE ISPHENOMENAL. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HER.
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW -- I THINKWE'D ALL AGREE 2014 WAS NOT A
GREAT YEAR FOR PEOPLE. BUTI THINK THE HOPE WAS THAT
2015 WOULD BRING SORT OFA RESPITE FROM THE KINDS OF
TERRIBLE EVENTS THAT HAVE BECOMEALL TOO FAMILIAR FOR US.
BUT, BUT -- OUR HEARTS ARE WITHTHE STAFF OF CHARLIE HEBDO AND
THEIR FAMILIES TONIGHT.I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE
GO INTO TO COMEDY, YOU KNOW, ASAN ACT OF COURAGE MAINLY BECAUSE
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT.
IT SHOULDN'T BE AN ACT OFCOURAGE. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS
ESTABLISHED LAW.BUT THOSE GUYS AT HEBDO HAD IT,
AND THEY WERE KILLED FOR THEIRCARTOONS.
STARK REMINDER THAT FOR THE MOSTPART THE LEGISLATORS AND
JOURNALISTS AND INSTITUTIONSTHAT WE JAB AND RIDICULE
ARE NOT IN ANY WAY THEENEMY.
FOR HOWEVER FRUSTRATING OROUTRAGED THE BACK AND FORTH CAN
BECOME IT'S STILL A BACK ANDFORTH A CONVERSATION AMONGST
THOSE ON LET'S CALL ITTEAM CIVILIZATION.
AND THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE ONLYCLARIFIES THAT REALITY.
BUT OF COURSE, OF COURSE OURGOAL TONIGHT IS NOT TO MAKE
SENSE OF THIS BECAUSE THERE ISNO SENSE TO BE MADE OF THIS.
OUR GOAL AS IT IS ALWAYS IS TOKEEP GOING. KEEP CALM AND CARRY
ON OR WHATEVER VERSION OF THATSAYING IS IN YOUR DORM ROOM.
