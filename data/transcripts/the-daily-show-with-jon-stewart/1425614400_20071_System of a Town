( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, GERALD POSNER.
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF "GOD'SBANKERS."
IT'S ABOUT BANKING SYSTEM IN THEVATICAN.
VERY INTERESTING.
BUT FIRST YOU REMEMBER AUGUST2014, IT WAS A GREAT MONTH FOR
ENTHUSIASTS OF SADNESS ANDMISERY.
AFRICAN AMERICAN TEENAGERMICHAEL BROWN SHOT BY WHITE
POLICE OFFICER DARREN WILSON INFERGUSON, MISSOURI.
ALL ACROSS AMERICA PEOPLE WEREOUTRAGED,
JUST NOT ALWAYS FOR THE SAMEREASON.
>> THE SLOGAN "BLACK LIVESMATTER" IS A FREQUENT CHANT
AMONG PROTESTERS AFTER THEFERGUSON SHOOTINGS.
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT RACE.
IT'S ABOUT RACE, IT'S ABOUT ABLACK MAN TARGETING A WHITE MAN.
>> RACE IS WRIT LARGE ALL OVERTHIS.
>> HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT!
>> A FALSE NARRATIVE THATMICHAEL BROWN HAD HIS HANDS UP
AND SAID, "DON'T SHOOT."
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
>> Jon:  YES, WHILE SOMESPRANG ANGRILY TO THE DEFENSE OF
WHITE DARREN WILSON, OTHERSSPOKE OF THE RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION ANDDEHUMANIZATION OF BLACK
RESIDENTS THAT SOWED THESEEDS OF THE HOSTILE
CONFRONTATION INTHE FIRST PLACE.
WELL, GOOD NEWS.
IT TURNS OUT EVERYBODY WASRIGHT.
>> THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENTHAS CLEARED FORMER POLICE
OFFICER DARREN WILSON OF CIVILRIGHTS VIOLATIONS OVER THE
SHOOTING OF AN UNARMED PLAQUETEENAGER.
>> IN A SECOND, SEPARATE REPORT,THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
CONCLUDED THE FERGUSON POLICEDEPARTMENT ROUTINELY ENGAGES IN
RACIALLY BIASED PRACTICES.
>> Jon:  ACCORDING TO OURJUSTICE DEPARTMENT, EVERYBODY'S
ANGER WAS SEPARATE BUT EQUALLYJUSTIFIED.
( LAUGHTER )IN A WAY, BOTH SIDES ACHIEVING A
BEAUTIFUL BALANCE OF RAGE, ASORT OF YIN AND YANG OF
RESENTMENT AND ANGER, SYMBOLIZEDBY THE ANCIENT TAOIST SYMBOL OF
THE COLORS BLACK AND WHITESEEMINGLY HEAD-BUTTING EACH
OTHER IN THE STOMACH.
( LAUGHTER )FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.
SO IN THE FIRST PLACE, FOX NEWS,LET THE SELF-VINDICATING
GLOATING BEGIN.
>> ERIC HOLDER HASNOW LOOKED AT AL SHARPTON AND
SAID, "WRONG, SIR, WRONG."
>> EVERYBODY THAT RUSHED TOJUDGMENT IN THIS CASE, I WOULD
SAY, ARE GUILTY OF CREATING ANATMOSPHERE IN FERGUSON THAT LED
TO A DISASTER.
>> Jon:  AND SPEAKING OFCREATING AN ATMOSPHERE IN
FERGUSON THAT LED TO A DISASTER,THE FERGUSON POLICE DEPARTMENT,
ERIC HOLDER LOOKED AT THEM ANDSAID WRONG THEM TOO, WRONG.
SIR.
WRONG.
( LAUGHTER )>> DESPITE MAKING UP ONLY 67% OF
THE POPULATION, AFRICANAMERICANS ACCOUNTED FOR A LITTLE
OVER 85% OF ALL TRAFFIC STOPS.
AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE TWICE ASLIKELY AS WHITE RESIDENTS TO BE
SEARCHED DURING A ROUTINETRAFFIC STOP, EVEN THOUGH THEY
WERE 26% LESS LIKELY TO CARRYCONTRABAND.
AFRICAN AMERICANS MADE UP OVER90% OF THOSE CHARGED WITH A
HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY OFFENSEDESCRIBED AS-- AND I QUOTE--
MANNER OF WALKING ALONG ROADWAY.
IS THERE WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?
"ROADWAY WALKIN."
( LAUGHTER )"WITH MANNER.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?""BEING BLACK WITH INTENT TO
CONTINUE BEING SO."
( LAUGHTER )ALL RIGHT, I'M ANGERED BY THAT
BUT I'M NOT YET FURIOUS.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
>> WHEN POLICE USED FORCE,NEARLY NINE TIMES OUT OF 10,
THEY USED IT AGAINST BLACKS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THEYPROBABLY JUST HIT THAT ONE
WHITE GUY OUT OF TEN BY ACCIDENTWHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO
HIT A BLACK GUY.
"COME HERE, BLACK GUY!
SORRY!"( LAUGHTER )
HOW DEEP DID THE FERGUSON P.D.'SRACISM GO?
SKIN COLOR WAS EVEN AN ISSUE FORTHE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE
WHO CANNOT SEE IN COLOR.
>> ONE OF THE MOST REVEALINGSTATISTICS IS THAT OF THE 15
TIMES FERGUSON POLICE DOGS HAVEBITTEN PEOPLE, THEY'VE ALL BEEN
AFRICAN AMERICANS.
( LAUGHTER )NOTE TO SELF:  HEARTWARMING
ANIMATED MOVIE ABOUT A RACISTPUPPY.
( LAUGHTER )WORKING TITLE "ALL DOGS GO TO
KLAN MEETINGS."
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )UNLESS YOU THINK THIS ENTIRE
STORY RESIDES ON RACISM AVENUE,PLEASE KNOW IT ALSO INTERSECTS
WITH CAPITALISM STREET.
>> THE CITY RELIES ON THE POLICEFORCE TO SERVE ESSENTIALLY AS A
COLLECTION AGENCYFOR THE MUNICIPAL COURT.
THREE OR FOUR CHARGES FOR ASINGLE
STOP IS CONSIDERED FAIRLYROUTINE.
>> 20% OF THE REVENUE OFFERGUSON COMES FROM THESE
SELECTIVE ARRESTS OF AFRICANAMERICANS.
>> IN 2013 ALONE, THE MUNICIPALCOURT SYSTEM RAISED $2.6 MILLION
ON THESE TYPES OF FINES.
>> Jon:  WHAT-- TWO-- $2.6MILLION IN MANNERED WALKING
AROUND MONEY.
MAYBE THEY DON'T HATE BLACKS.
THEY JUST LOVE GREEN.
