YOU WERE ABOUT TO PULL SOMETHINGOUT OF YOUR POCKET THAT I
THINK --[LAUGHING]
>> Jon: -- WAS GOING TO TAKE USBOTH ON A HOBBIT LIKE JOURNEY.
WHAT IS THAT?
>> WELL, THIS IS A SMART STONE.
AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT --IT IS SORT OF LIKE A RIVER STONE
BUT IT'S CONNECTED WITH ANOTHERPERSON.
SO, IT'S SORT OF A CUTE STORY.
BUT, I HAVE A YOUNG DAUGHTER.AND WE, WHEN WE...
>> Jon: OK. HOW HOLD?
>> SHE'S 11 RIGHT NOW.
Jon: AW, THAT'S NICE.
>> AND WHEN WE HOLD HANDS WEHAVE SORT OF A MESSAGING
SYSTEM BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. SOSHE'LL, YOU KNOW, SHE'LL,
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO SAY THINGS...
>> Jon: I HAVE TO REPAIR MYRELATIONSHIP WITH MY DAUGHTER,
IS THE MESSAGE OF THIS.
I HAVE, I HAVE NOMESSAGE SYSTEM.
I DON'T EVEN TALK TO THEM.
>> THIS EXTERNALIZES OR MAKESREMOTE THOSE SORTS OF HAND
SQUEEZES. SO SHE CAN, SO IF SHEGESTURES WITH THIS, OR GESTURES
ON THE SURFACE...>> Jon RIGHT.
>> I GET THE SAME MESSAGE WHENI'M HOLDING IT, OR WHEN IT'S
NEAR MY BODY.
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU AQUESTION. BECAUSE IT IS,
IT'S VERY "AWE" INDUCING.
IS THIS YOUR WAY TO STOP HOLDINGHER HAND. IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
YOUR WAY OF SAYING TO YOURDAUGHTER, "WHAT'S WITH THE
SWEATY PALMS THERE, GIRLIE?"HAS SHE USED IT?
LIKE, WHAT IS A MESSAGE YOUWOULD SEND? LIKE, I LOVE YOU?

GIRL BEFORE SHE THROWS THAT OUT.>> YEAH.
[LAUGHING] >> Jon: BECAUSE AS FAR AS I
KNOW, ANY GIRL WHO'SAPPROACHING THE TEEN YEARS
WHO GETS A CONSTANT FROMHER DAD GOING "I SEE YOU."
I THINK SHE WOULD SAY, "OH WELLCAN YOU SMELL THE POT?"
>> RIGHT. [LAUGHING]
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THAT'S -- BUTIT'S A, IT'S A
I THINK IT'S A LOVELY WAY OFHUMANIZING TECHNOLOGY, YES?
>> YEAH. AND I THINK IT TAKESSOME OF THE, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE DO A LOT WITH PHONES ISMESSAGE EACH OTHER, AND
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A SENSEOF HUMAN CONNECTEDNESS.
BUT THAT TAKES A LOT OFEFFORT TO, YOU KNOW, READ ALL OF
YOUR TWITTER FEED EVERY DAY.>> Jon: SURE.
>> SO, IF WE CAN MAKE THOSEMESSAGES MORE GLANCABLE AND
MORE LIGHTWEIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU'RE LIKE THE GUY WHOCAME BY AND IS LIKE, 30 SECONDS
FOR A BAKED POTATO? [BLEEP]THAT!
IF I CAN'T HAVE IT IN 5SECONDS, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT. LIKE IT IS, IT'STAKING THESE SMALL THINGS, AND
HOW MANY OF THESE DEVICES DO YOUCARRY WITH YOU?
>> WELL, I MEAN, ONE OF THEINTERESTING THINGS ABOUT BEING
AT M.I.T. THERE AREMANY PROTOTYPES.
IT'S JUST THIS TORRENT OFEXPERIMENTS AND PROTOTYPES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND SOMETIMES THEY WORK, AND
SOMETIMES THEY SORT OF WORK.>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> BUT, I THINK IT'S CRITICALTHAT WE PUT THEM IN OUR LIVES
AND TRY THEM...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IN ORDER TO GET A REAL SENSEOF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO LIVE
WITH THEM.
>> Jon: I LOVE THE IDEA THAT ITHELPS CONNECT YOU TO YOUR
FAMILY OR TO OTHER PEOPLE. ITHINK THAT'S A REALLY NICE...
DO YOU THINK THAT IS MORETHAN LIKELY THE DIRECTION IT
GOES IN, LIKE, IN THE WAYTHAT NOW WITH OUR PHONES IF
SOMEONE GOES SHOPPINGFOR YOU, THEY WILL CALL YOU UP
AND THEY WILL TAKE A PICTURE.AND THEY'LL DO THE THING.
BUT NOW MAYBE, EMBEDDEDIN THE CLOTHES WILL BE,
THEY'LL RUB IT...
>> WELL, IT COULD BE FROM SNOWWHITE.
IT MIGHT BE EMBEDDED IN THENARCISSISTIC MIRROR.
YOU HAVE SORT OF A SOMETHINGTHAT WILL RELAY THAT TO YOU.
>> JON: DUDE, I'M TOTALLYGOING TO WORK ON THAT WITH
YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ABILLION M.I.T. DOLLARS.
IT'S FASCINATING STUFF.
AND ARE, ARE YOUR STUDENTSONBOARD WITH THAT?
LIKE, TO THEM IT PROBABLY FEELSNATURAL.
>> IT DOES FEEL NATURAL. AND ITDOES, I MEAN, THERE ARE,
YOU WOULD ALMOST BE CHALLENGEDTO COME UP WITH AN OBJECT OR A
SURFACE THAT MOST STUDENTSBELIEVE WON'T BE IMBUED WITH
SOME SORT OF SENSING ORCONNECTIVITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> OR DISPLAY.
AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT PIXELS.IT'S PROBABLY LIKE A HAPTIC
DISPLAY OR SOUND BASED DISPLAYOR A SCENT BASED DISPLAY.
>> Jon: YEAH. I KNOW WHAT YOUWERE SAYING UP UNTIL YOU SAID
PIXELS. AND THEN SOMETHINGHAPPENED WITH HAPTIC, AND I,
NOW I'M JUST GOING TO PRETENDTHAT'S SOMETHING FROM THE OLD
TORAH. I DON'T KNOW.
I LOVE IT, ALTHOUGH, I'M STILLFASCINATED BY THE FACT YOU HAVE
A SCALE THAT TWEETS.
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THATTHE TWEETS AREN'T ALL JUST LIKE
SOMEONE IS STANDING ON ME.#MYLIFESUCKS.
