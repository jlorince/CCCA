I'M NUTS!
>> Jon: LOOK, REPUBLICANS, I
KNOW YOU MISS THE
INTOXICATING HIGH OF THE
EARLY '80s.
BUT LOOK IN THE MIRROR, MAN,
LOOK WHERE CHASING THE
REAGAN HAS LED YOU, TO THE
BASEMENT OF A BROKEN DOWN A
BAN DAWNED DRUG DEN STUCK IN
[BLEEP] JUST TO SCORE A $5
ROCK.
(LAUGHTER)
METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
AND IF YOU WON'T LISTEN TO
ME, AND I KNOW THAT YOU
WON'T BECAUSE I KNOW YOU
DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR
ME, FIND WHAT I DO SOMEWHAT
CRASS AND MISLEADING, LISTEN
TO YOUR FRIENDS.
THIS IS AN INTERVENTION.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE ALL RIGHT
NOW IN A SECAUCUS HAMPTON
INN.
EVERYONE IS HERE TODAY
BECAUSE THEY LOVE YOU.
TOM, WHY DON'T YOU START US
OFF, TOM.
>> I'M NOT INCLINED TO BE A
SUPPORTER OF NEWT GINGRICH'S
HAVING SERVED UNDER HIM FOR
FOUR YEARS AND EXPERIENCED
PERSONALLY HIS LEADERSHIP.
>> WHY IS THAT?
>> BECAUSE I FOUND IT
LACKING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> TOM COBURN, REPUBLICAN
SENATOR FROM PERHAPS THE
MOST REPUBLICAN STATE IN THE
COUNTRY, OKLAHOMA.
YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND PEOPLE
WITH BLUE EYES IN OKLAHOMA.
(LAUGHTER)
COBURN IS SO CONSERVATIVE HE
ONCE LODGED A PROTEST
AGAINST SHOWING "SCHINDLER'S
LIST" ON TV BECAUSE OF THE
NUDITY.
THAT'S TRUE.
YES.
THE NUDITY.
THAT'S WHAT STRIKES YOU AS
OBSCENE IN "SCHINDLER'S
LIST".
WILL YOU LISTEN TO THIS GUY.
>> YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN OUT
OF GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG
TIME.
HE'S MATURED AS A PERSON.
HE HAS REATTACHED HIMSELF TO
FAITH.
>> Jon: WHAT?
NO, LISTEN YOURSELF!
FIRST OF ALL REATTACHED
HIMSELF TO HIS FAITH, LIKE
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
IS FAITH JUST LOST THE
STICKUM, YOU HAVE TO LICK IT
AND STICK UP THERE.
THE ONLY FAITH GINGRICH HAS
REATTACHED HIMSELF TO IS
BEGINNINGISMISM-- GINGRICHISM,
THE BELIEF IN THE
INFALLIBILITY OF THE
GINGRICH THIS IS HIM FROM
LAST MONTH.
>> I AM MUCH LIKE REAGAN AND
MARGARET THATCHER, I AM SUCH
AN UNCONVENTIONAL POLITICAL
FIGURE THAT YOU REALLY NEED
TO DESIGN A VERY UNIQUE
CAMPAIGN THAT FITS THE WAY I
OPERATE AND WHAT I AM TRYING
TO DO.
>> Jon: HEY, NEWT, DONALD
TRUMP CALLED, HE WANTS HIS
IRRATIONAL EGO BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HEY, WHAT YOU ARE
GOING TO DO BOOM, BA, BOOM.
>> Jon: WOULD ANYONE ELSE
LIKE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO
THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE
AND CONVINCE THEM.
>> I DON'T THINK NEWT
GINGRICH CARES ABOUT
CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLESES.
NEWT GINGRICH CARES ABOUT
NEWT GINGRICH.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW HE CAN
BE CONSIDERED A
CONSERVATIVE.
>> MOST OF US ARE TERRIFIED
TO DPET THAT HE WOULD BECOME
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.
>> HE'S TOO ERRATIC.
>> I THINK HE DOES NOT HAVE
THE DISCIPLINE, DOES NOT
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONTROL
HIM EF IS-- HIMSELF.
AND HE CAN'T STAY FOCUSED.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHO YOU ARE
GOING TO NOMINATE FOR
PRESIDENT.
CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF, CAN'T
STAY FOCUSED, TOO ERRATIC.
THOSE LAST DESCRIPTIONS ARE
USUALLY FOLLOWED BY THE
PHRASE, AND HE'S DISRUPTIVE
AT NAP TIME AND A BIT OF A
BITER.
DO YOU GET IT?
(APPLAUSE)
ARE YOU SEEING WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?
OKAY, I SEE SOMEONE ELSE
WANTS TO SPEAK.
YOU HAVE HAD YOUR HAND UP
FOR A WHILE.
>> HE IS NOT A NICE HUMAN
BEING.
HE IS A BAD PERSON.
>> Jon: JOE, JOE, JOE, I
THINK WE'VE ALREADY
IDENTIFIED OUR NEGATIVE
INVENTORIES.
NOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR
SCAFFOLDING, SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE, UP, A WAY OUT.
>> ES IS A TERRIBLE PERSON.
HE-- HE DEHUMANIZES THE
PEOPLE-- .
>> Jon: YES, YES, HE IS
TERRIBLE.
LOOK, WE GET T YOU [BLEEP]
LOOK, GOP, I CAN'T MAKE YOU
NOT CHOOSE NEWT GINGRICH AS
THE STANDARD-BEARER OF YOUR
POLITICAL PARTY.
BUT BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY
DECISION, THERE IS-- THERE'S
ONE MORE PERSON WHO WANTS TO
SAY SOMETHING, SOMEONE WHO
IS LITERALLY COMING OUT OF
HIDING JUST TO BE HERE
TODAY.
BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT.
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'VE HIT ROCK BOTTOM YET,
MAYBE WILL YOU NOW.
>> IS THERE ANY WAY HE COULD
BE BEHIND GINGRICH.
>> HE SOME ONLY-- BECK COULD
BE BEHIND GINGRICH.
>> HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE
THAT I CANNOT VOTE FOR.
>> Jon: GLENN BECK CANNOT
SUPPORT NEWT GINGRICH!
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU
NEED, WHAT YOU JUST SAW IS
THE POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF
WAKING UP IN A DUMPSTER WITH
SOMEONE ELSE'S CAN DOM IN
YOUR PANTS.
