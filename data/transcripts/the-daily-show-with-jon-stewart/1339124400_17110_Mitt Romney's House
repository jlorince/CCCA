( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MIRE GUEST TONIGHT, EDWARD CONARD, HE ARGUES IN HIS NEW BOOK THAT INCOME EQUALITY
MAY NOT BE SUCH A TERRIBLE THING.
THE RICH COULD PAY FEWER TAXESMENT I'M SURE OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE BRIEF.
BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A MORNING, SPECIFICALLY MORNING JOE WHOSE HOST, ONE
JOSEPH P MORNING WAS A BIT UP SET ABOUT AN ARTICLE HE HAD SEEN IN TODAY'S "NEW
YORK TIMES" HOME SECTION TELLING THE CONSTRUCTION AT MITT ROMNEY'S LA JOLLA HOME
AND WHAT MR. MORNING FELT WAS AN UNFAIR ATTEMPT TO SMEAR MR. ROMNEY AS RICH, AN
ELITIST, OUT OF TOUCH.
>> DID "THE NEW YORK TIMES" EVER DISPATCH REPORTERS TO JOHN KERRY'S HOMESMENT
BECAUSE JOHN KERRY IS WORTH A LOT MORE MONEY, OBVIOUSLY,
THAN MITT ROMNEY.
>> IF YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE CAN SHOW ME THIS TYPE OF SPREAD FROM
FOUR-- FROM EIGHT YEARS AGO ON JOHN KERRY AND HIS MASSIVE ACCUMULATIONS, AND ON TERESA HEINZ KERRY.
>> Jon: WOW.
WELL, I GUESS IF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" DID DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD TOTALLY
TAKE THE WIND OUT OF THIS MAN'S COMPLAINT.
IS THERE A WAY TO FIND OUT.
IT'S A LIVE TELEVISION SHOW.
EVERYBODY IS WORKING-- WHAT'S THAT BE,
WILLIE GEIST, THE GUY NEXT TO MR. SCARBOROUGH AND HAS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.
>> I HAVE PIECE FOR YOU.
>> OKAY.
>> FROM OCTOBER 10th, 2004,
IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW THE PERCEPTION OF JOHN KERRY'S
ELITISM, THE COUPLE HAVE AN 18 CENTURY TOWN HOUSE, A KITCHEN TWO STORIES HIGH, AN
88 ACRE PITTSBURGH AREA ESTATE, PRIVATE GULF STREAM JET N WINTER HE GOES HELICOPTER SKIING WHILE
STAYING AT HIS WIFE'S IDAHO RETREAT, A 15th CENTURY FARMHOUSE TRANSPORTED FROM
ENGLAND AND REASSEMBLED ON THE BANKS OF THE BIG WOOD RIVER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HE ALSO HAD 15th CENTURY SERF CLONED AND REANIMATED BY SCIENTISTSMENT
BUT SO WHAT, SO THE LATTE LEFTIST OF THE TIMES ONCE BURIED A KERRY ELITISM STORY
ON PAGE-- A1 OF THE POPULAR SUNDAY EDITION JUST FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THE NATIONAL ELECTION.
HOW DOES THAT MATCH UP TO THE ROMNEY STORY IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FAMED HOME SECTION?
KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAS A HOME SECTION?
(LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
WAS'S THE POINT AGAIN?
>> ITS PROPORTIONALITY.
IT'S ALL ABOUT PROPORTIONALITY.
IF IT WERE "THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER", AND THEY WERE DOING THIS TO BOTH
CANDIDATES I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD.
I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT,
FAIR GAME.
