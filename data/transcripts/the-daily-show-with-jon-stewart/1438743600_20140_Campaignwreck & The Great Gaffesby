>> Jon: WELCOME TO  "THE DAILYSHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GUESTTONIGHT, HIS NAME IS DENIS
LEARY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STOP, STOP, STOP!
THE ROAD TO THE 2016 ELECTIONCONTINUES TO WIND ITS SLOW
TORTUROUS WAY ACROSS AMERICA.
LAST NIGHT IT PAST THROUGH NEWHAMPSHIRE IN THE VOTER'S FIRST
FORUM, WHERE 14 REPUBLICANCANDIDATES APPEARED TO SEE WHO
WOULD BE  CHOSEN AS THEIRPARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.
I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLD THATTHAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM A
COLLECTION OF INDISTINGUISHABLEINDIVIDUALS UNDERGOING A MUCH
MORE SKILL-BASED SELECTIONPROCESS.
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING FROM THEFORUM?
>> THE TWO-HOUR FORUM PLAYED OUTLIKE POLITICAL SPEED DATING, 14
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SHARING ASINGLE STAGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
>> Jon: A SINGLE STAGE!
THAT'S THE WORST DINNERPRODUCTION OF "CATS" EVER!
LOOKED LIKE THIS.
ANGELICAL CAT SENATOR TED CRUZATTENDED VIA SATELLITE.
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT HECOULDN'T ATTEND IN PERSON?
>> IN TEXAS, WE COOK BACON ALITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN MOST
FOLKS.
â™ª
(GUNFIRE)
THERE'S GREASE COMIN' DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ARE WE SURE THAT'SGREASE?
PERHAPS SOME EJACULATE FROM HOWMUCH YOU LOVE GUNS?
BY THE WAY, YOU REALLY NEED TOADD BACON TO GET AMERICANS TO
LIKE GUNS?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, IT'S NOT SALADOR MEDICINE.
AMERICANS USE GUNS FOR A LOT OFTHINGS -- CORING APPLES,
UNCLOGGING TOILETS, EAR PIERCING -- AH...
LISTEN, GIT 'ER DONE!
I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THETHE REPUBLICAN RACE BEING SUCH A
CIRCUS.
AT LEAST IT'S FUN TO WATCH.
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY  IS ONEJOYLESS DEATH MARCH TO HILLARY
CLINTON NOMINATION.
SURE, BERNIE SANDERS IS DRAWINGCROWDS BY THE THOUSANDS, BUT THE
MEDIA DECIDED YOU CAN'T BE ASERIOUS CANDIDATE IF YOUR HAIR
LOOKS LIKE YOUR DICK GOT CAUGHTIN AN ELECTRICAL SOCKET!
(LAUGHTER)
NOW... SEEMS THERE IS NOTHINGTHAT COULD SHAKE UP THE
DEMOCRATIC RACE.
>> BIG NEWS IN RACE FOR THEWHITE HOUSE.
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDENCONSIDERING A CHALLENGE TO
HILLARY CLINTON.
>> Jon: WHOA...
JOE BIDEN!
JOE SAYS HE CAN'T GO INTO A7-ELEVEN WITHOUT AN INDIAN
ACCIDENT, ASKS A GUY IN AWHEELCHAIR TO STAND UP, PRAISES
A GUY'S DEAD MOMS EVEN THOUGHSHE'S STILL ALIVE BIDEN?
HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?
>> JOE BIDEN'S GAFFES AREBECAUSE  HE SAYS THINGS
WITHOUTH THINKING, WITHOUGHPOLLING, HE SAYS THINGS FROM
HIS HEART AND I THINK THAT'SAN ATTRACTIVE QUALITY IN THE
CURRENT ATMOSPHERE.
>> HE'S AUTHENTIC, NATURAL.
>> DESPITE HIS GAFFES AND MAYBEEVEN PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS
GAFFES, BECAUSE HE CAN BE VERYCHARMING AND RELATABLE.
>> Jon: REALLY?
SO THE REASON LOOSE LIPS McGEE(BLEEP) UP HIS 2008 PRESIDENTIAL
RUN IS NOW THE REASON HE'S AVIABLE CANDIDATE?
YOU KNOW, NOT JUST BLURTING(BLEEP) OUT, THAT'S A PRE-TRUMP
PRESIDENTIAL QUALITY.
POST-TRUMP IS ALL ABOUT SAYINGTHE CRAZY.
CLEARLY, HILLARY CLINTON'S GOINGTO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO
ADDRESS THE DEFICIT IF SHEWANTS TO FEND OFF JOE
AUTHENTICITY.
>> TO SOFTEN HER IMAGE, HILLARYRELEASED HER CAMPAIGN ADS
OVERNIGHT, BOTH FEATURING HERMOTHER.
>> Jon: THAT'S SMART.
BRINGING SOME HUMANITY TO HER.
CAN WE SEE ONE OF THOSEIMAGE-SOFTENING ADS?
>> I'M HILLARY CLINTON, I'M JUSTLIKE YOU AND OTHER HUMANS.
I HAVE A MOTHER WHO'S ALSO AHUMAN FEMALE LIKE ME.
AS A FETUS, I GESTATED IN HERUTERUS THE WAY HUMAN OFFSPRING
DO.
THEN I TRAVELED THROUGH HERCERVIX AND EMERGED FROM HER
VAGINA IN THE NORMAL HUMANFASHION.
I'M HILLARY CLINTON AND IAPPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
THAT'S TOTALLY HOW I WAS BORN!
(APPLAUSE)
FOR MORE, WE TURN TO HASANMINHAJ OUTSIDE CLINTON
CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS INBROOKLYN.
HASAN, IS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGNWORRIED ABOUT BIDEN ENTERING
THIS RACE?
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND HILLARYCLINTON IS DOING GAFFE PREP AS
WE SPEAK, JON.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY, GAFFE PREP?
>> YES, SHE IS WORKING AROUNDTHE CLOCK WITH ADVISORS ON
BLURTING OUT INTEMPERATE ANDSPONTANEOUS REMARKS.
HERE'S ONE THAT THEY'RE TESTINGRIGHT NOW FOR AN IOWA RUN.
JON, I'M JUST GOING TO TEST THISONE REAL QUICK...
HI!
FAT TO MEET YOU! I MEAN, NICE TOMEET YOU!
OR, HOLY (BLEEP)!
LOOK AT THAT KID'S HEAD!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THOSE AREN'T GAFFES,THAT JUST SEEMS MEAN.
>> PERHAPS, BUT THE CLINTON ARENTHE LAB IS STILL FINE-TUNING THE
GAFFE ALGORYTHM.
NOW TRUST ME, ONCE THEY'VEWORKSHIPPED HER MISSPEAKING
MATRIX, THERE'S NO TELLING WHATSHE WILL BE INCREDIBLY PREPARED
TO HAVE REGRETED SAYING.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
