FIRST, CONGRATULATIONSTO THE PATRIOTS -- ANYWAY, GOT A
GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
HAD A GREAT SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
BUPKIS. NOW WE GOT BUPKIS.
SEE, THURSDAY WE GOT WIND OF ALITTLE SOMETHING THAT WAS
HAPPENING AT THE PENTAGON.
>> THE U.S. IS NOW CLASSIFYINGPREVIOUSLY PUBLICALLY HELD
INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAR INAFGHANISTAN, THINGS LIKE THE
AFGHAN TROOP LEVELS, THEAMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS
BEING SPENT THERE AND WHEREIT'S BEING SPENT.
>> Jon: OR AFGHAN TROOP LEVELS,YOUR SPENDING LEVELS, YOUR
LITERACY PROGRAMS, YOURSTATIONARY LEVELS,
YOUR HBO GO PASSWORDS, YOURSECRET SANTAS. ALL!
NOW THIS IS ALL JUST WEEKS AFTERTHE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT
WE WERE ENDING OUR COMBATANYTHING MISSION IN
AFGHANISTAN.
VERY SUSPICIOUS, THOUGHT WEHERE AT THE SHOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> A CLASSIC CASE OF A
GOVERNMENTAL ORWELLIANCOVER-UP.
THE REALITY OF A WARDISAPPEARING INTO THE ABYSS
OF BUREAUCRATIC SEMANTICS. FACTSON THE GROUND OBSCURED
BY THE BOLD 24 POINT FONT OF ACLASSIFIED STAMP.
WE IMMEDIATELY GOT TO, WORK.
NOT RESEARCHING BUT CREATINGTHIS GRAPHIC OPENING.
(LAUGHTER) NOW, NOW,
HOW WONDERFULFULLY RYE.
(LAUGHTER)WE EVEN HAD THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES ON TAPEREBUTTING THE VERY IDEA OF
THESE TYPES OF I WILL USEHIS WORDS, WELL, NOT REALLY,
SHENANIGANS.
>> WE'VE GOT SECRET TASK FORCES, SECRET BUDGETING. I WILL TURN
THE PAGE ON A GROWING EMPIREOF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
AND RESTORE THE BALANCEWE'VE LOST BETWEEN THE
NECESSARILY SECRET AND THENECESSITY OF OPENNESS IN A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
>> Jon: CLASSIC DAILY SHOWGOTCHA.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THEN, TRAGICALLY,
SENSELESSLY, JUST ONE HOURBEFORE WE WERE TO TAPE, HE
FIXED THE [BLEEP] PROBLEM.
THE AMERICAN MILITARY COMMANDABRUPTLY REVERSED ITS
DECISION TO CLASSIFY DETAILSABOUT THE AFGHAN ARMY.
YOU MOTHER [BLEEP].
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TALKABOUT NOW?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME,
WHO IS GOING TO SERVE ME UPA MEATBALL THAT I CAN DIG
INTO INN TO CARRY US THROUGHTHE REST OF THE ACT.
>> THERE IS A DISCONNECTBETWEEN PEOPLE WHO LIVE
IN THE BUBBLES OF NEW YORK -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> WASHINGTON AND HOLLYWOOD
VERSUS THE PEOPLE WHO LIVEIN THE LAND OF THE BUBBAS.
>> Jon: HUCKABEE.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S ON A BOOK TOUR. HE'LL SAVEUS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE FOOTAGE.
SO WHAT HAS TED NUGENT'SFAVORITE BASS PLAYER AND
AUTHOR OF GOD, GRAVY,GABAGOOL AND LADY GAGA,
WHAT'S HE BEEN SAYING?
>> WHERE IN A BUSINESS MEETINGTHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THE
SOUTH OR IN THE MIDWESTTHERE IN IOWA, YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE PEOPLE WHO WOULD JUSTTHROW THE F BOMB AND USE
GRATUITOUS PROFANITY IN APROFESSIONAL SETTING.
IN NEW YORK, NOT ONLY DO THEMEN DO IT,
BUT THE WOMEN DO IT.
AS WE WOULD SAY IN THE SOUTH,THAT'S JUST TRASHY.
>> Jon: WHAT THE?
WHAT THE?
YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF[BLEEP] [BLEEP] IS THIS?
WOMEN IN THE SOUTH-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
A SOUTHERN LADY OF THEPROFESSIONAL CLASS NEVER
EVEN LEARNED SUCH [BLEEP]FOULNESS.
NO.
THE WORST THING A SOUTHERNBUSINESSWOMAN MIGHT SAY IS
FUDGE.
AND THEN SHE WOULD PROBABLYOFFER YOU A PLATE OF FUDGE.
(LAUGHTER)OH WAIT, UNLESS, WAIT, I'M
SORRY.
IS THE "N" WORD A CURSE ORIS THAT MORE JUST A
TRADITION.
IS THAT-- BUT I'M LOVINGHUCKABEE'S NEW I'M JUST A
SHOCKED SOUTHERN VERSION OFBUDDY THE ELF UP IN NEW YORK.
AND ALL OF THAT WAS JUST AWARMUP FOR HUCKABEE'S TAKE ON
MEN WHO HAVE S-E-X TOGETHER.
>> GOVERNOR, YOU'VE TALKEDABOUT GAY MARRIAGE.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
AND HOW MUCH YOUR OWN PARTYHAS CHANGED.
SHOULDN'T THERE BE ROOM FORTHOSE WHO WANT SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE TO BE THE LAW OFTHE LAND?
>> THE VERY FACT THAT I TALKABOUT RELATIONSHIPS I HAVE
WITH FRIENDS WITH WHO AREGAY INDICATES THAT I'M NOT A
PERSON WHO SHUTS EVERYBODYOUT AROUND ME WHO DISAGREES.
IT IS A BIBLICAL ISSUE.
AND IT'S A BIBLICAL ISSUEUNLESS, YOU KNOW, I GET A
NEW VERSION OF THESCRIPTURES, IT'S REALLY NOT
MY PLACE TO SAY, OKAY, I'MJUST GOING TO EVOLVE.
>> Jon: I CAN'T JUST CHANGEWITH THE TIMES.
IF IT MEANS DEVIATING FROMBIBLICAL LAW.
IT'S WHY HUCKABEE NEVERMIXES FABRICS IN HIS CLOTHES
OR TRIMS HIS BEARD OR SLEEPSWITH ANOTHER MAN'S SLAVE.
IT WOULD BE WRONG.
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD, THISIS A RESPECTED AND INTELLIGENT
GUY, SO MAYBE IT IS ME.
MAYBE I'M JUST NOT CAPABLE OFGETTING IT.
UNLESS SOMEONE CAN MAKE THISARGUMENT AGAINST TOLERATING
SAME-SEX COUPLES IN TERMS THAT ICAN RELATE TO PERSONALLY.
>> IT'S LIKE ASKING SOMEBODYWHO IS JEWISH TO START SERVING
BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP IN THEIRDELI.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, LET MEJUST CLARIFY SOMETHING.
NOT ALL JEWS OWN A DELI.
SOME OF US-- (APPLAUSE)
SOME OF US, AND ISAY THIS WITH RESPECT,
SOME OF US ARE LAWYERS WHOREPRESENT DELI OWNERS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT MORE IMPORTANT,
THAT ANALOGY MAKES NO [BLEEP]SENSE.
NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO GETMETAPHORICALLY MARRIED TO
THE BIBLICAL ABOMINATIONTHAT IS THIS BACON WRAPPED
SHRIMP.
PEOPLE ARE JUST WANTING TOBE ALLOWED TO EAT SLASH
MARRY IT THEMSELVES. BUT IHEAR YOUR DOG WHISTLE.
THIS IS ABOUT THATFUNDAMENTALIST FEAR THAT IF GAY
MARRIAGE BECOMES THE LAW OF THELAND, CHRISTIAN BUSINESSES
WILL HAVE TO CATER GAYWEDDINGS OR TAILOR THEIR
SLIM FITTED GAY SUITS ANDMAYBE THEY WOULD.
BUT WHY DOES THIS CONCERN FORRELIGIOUS SMALL BUSINESSES
ONLY COME UP AROUND GAY PEOPLE?ALL I'M SAYING IS,
WHEN STRAIGHT PEOPLE GETMARRIED DOESN'T THE BIBLE
SAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BEVIRGINS, OR AT LEAST THE
WOMAN IS, THANK YOU, BIBLE.
I'M PRETTY SURE CHRISTIANBUSINESS OWNERS WHEN THE
HAPPY COUPLE COME TO ORDERTHEIR CAKE DOESN'T GO I
WOULD LOVE TO BAKE YOUR CAKEBUT FIRST A HYMEN TEST.
(LAUGHTER)UNLESS I'M WRONG,
AFTER ALL, BIBLICAL LAW ISBIBLICAL LAW.
YOU DON'T WANT TO EVOLVE.
AND IF YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWNON GAY MARRIAGE WHO IS TO
STOP JEWS FROM BEING FORCEDTO SERVE BACON TAINTED
SHRIMP?
>> HEY, HEY JON. HEY, DOWN HERE.HEY.
>> Jon: WHAT THE? OH MYGOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
>> HI THERE.
>> Jon: IT'S LOVABLE DAILY SHOWREGULAR,  BACON WRAPPED SHRIMPY.
HEY, WHAT'S UP! HOW ARE YA?
(APPLAUSE)
HEY BUDDY. HEY.
>> YEAH. YEAH. YOU DON'T, YOUDON'T SEEM THAT HAPPY TO SEE ME.
YOU KIND OF LOOKED AWAY.
IS THAT BECAUSE ARE YOUASHAMED TO BE SEEN WITH ME?
>> Jon: NO I'M NOT ASHAMED --I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS
A FRIEND. I DON'T NEED TO AGREEWITH YOUR LIFESTYLE TO BE
FRIENDS WITH YOU.
>> OH, OH, YOU THINK GOD DOESN'TAPPROVE OF WHO I AM?
>> Jon: WHAT?
NO, I JUST-- I DON'T HAVE ANOPINION.
I JUST GO BY THE BIBLE.
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT WHILE YOUARE MY FRIEND, YOU ARE A HELL
BOUND CRIME WRAPPED IN ANABOMINATION HELD TOGETHER BY
SOME SORT OF TOOTH PICK OFSIN.
>> YEAH.
JON, DID I ASK TO BE ASHRIMP WRAPPED IN BACON.
NO, THIS IS HOW GOD MADE ME.
>> Jon: ACTUALLY I THINK ITWAS THE GUY FROM THE FOOD
EMPORIUM.
>> LOOK, THE POINT IS, IT WASN'TMY CHOICE.
AND IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT MEFOR WHO I AM THEN MAYBE YOU
WERE NEVER REALLY MY FRIEND.
>> Jon: WOW.
WOW.
SO UNEXPECTEDLY EMOTIONAL,BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: I HAD NO IDEA YOUHAD THAT DEPTH OF RANGE.
>> I DO.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE ITHINK ARE YOU GOING TO HELL
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T BEFRIENDS.
WE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND PLAYINGAPPLES-TO-APPLES WHICH BY
THE WAY MAKES AN EXCELLENTGARNISH, I MEAN, UNCLEAN!
YOU'RE UNCLEAN!
>> NO, THAT'S IT. NOPE.GOOD-BYE, JON. THAT'S IT.
>> Jon: WELL FINE! GO, JUST GO!MAYBE YOU CAN BE BEST
FRIENDS WITH MIKE HUCKABEE.
>> NO, I CAN'T BECAUSE HEDOESN'T APPROVE OF ME BEING
GAY.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: WHAT?
YOU'RE ALSO-- WOW.
YOU'RE ALSO-- YOU'RE GAY?
>> OH, WHAT, SO A SHRIMPWRAPPED IN BACON CAN'T BE
GAY EITHER?
OH, MAN, BUDDY, YOU GOT ALOT OF HATE IN YOUR HEART.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BERIGHT BACK.
SORRY.
