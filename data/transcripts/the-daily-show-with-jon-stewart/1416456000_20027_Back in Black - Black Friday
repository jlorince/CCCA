>> Jon:  WELECOME BACK.
WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGHTHE CRACKS,
LEWIS BLACK CATCHES IT IN ASEGMENT WE CALL BACK IN BLACK.
â™ª >> NEXT WEEK IS MY FAVORITE DAY
OF THE YEAR.
BLACK FRIDAY.
TRAMPLE A GUY ON A TUESDAYAFTERNOON YOU GET CHARGED WITH
ASSAULT BUT DO IT AT A WAL-MARTON A BLACK FRIDAY YOU GET A PS4.
BUT THIS YEAR, SOMETHING ABOUTBLACK FRIDAY IS TWISTING
EVERYONE'S PANTIES.
>> BLACK FRIDAY ITSELF ISTURNING INTO AN ENTIRE SEASON.
>> DO I HOPE BLACK FRIDAY ENDS?
ABSOLUTELY. I CAN'TSTAND THAT DAY.
>> THE EVENT IS BECOMING SOLONG.
>> STARTING BLACK FRIDAY ONTHANKSGIVING SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.
>> BLACK WEDNESDAY.
>> GRAY THURSDAY.
>> SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY.
>> CYBER MONDAY IS THEWORST THING I EVER HEARD.
>> WE MIGHT AS WELL CALL ITBLACK NOVEMBER.
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOUCOMPLAINING ABOUT?
OH NO, NOW BLENDERS ON SALE FORA WHOLE MONTH!
GOD, WHY HAVE THOU FORSAKEN US?
NOBODY'S FORCING YOU TO BUYANYTHING.
YOU CAN SHOP, YOU CAN NOT SHOP.
YOU CAN DO WHAT WE JEWS DO ANDWAIT UNTIL THE DAY AFTER
CHRISTMAS WHEN THEY'REPRACTICALLY GIVING [BLEEP] AWAY.
BUT THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLEWHO SHOULD BE COMPLAINING.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS ATTHESE STORES?
>> YEAH, WHEN EXACTLY DO THEYGET TO CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING
WITH THEIR FAMILIES?
>> WORKERS ARE UPSET.
>> FORCED TO WORK.
>> THEY KEEP SAYING THAT THEYCARE ABOUT THEIR ASSOCIATES.
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
>> THE DAUGHTER OF A K MARTEMPLOYEE ASKING K MART TO CHANGE
THEIR THANKSGIVING HOURS SO HERMOM CAN SPEND THE DAY AT HOME
WITH HER FAMILY.
>> I THINK WE SHOULD ALL HAVETHE ABILITY TO SAY I DON'T WANT
TO WORK THANKSGIVING.
>> WELL PERSONALLY, I'D MUCHRATHER SPEND THANKSGIVING AT
K MART HELPING THE FAT GUY SHOVEHIS WAY INTO A PAIR OF
CROCS BEATS LISTENING TO MYNEPHEW EXPLAIN AGAIN HOW
HE'S ALLERGIC TO BEETS. NOYOU'RE NOT, MATTHEW.
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE THEM. NOBODYDOES.
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO [BLEEP] EATTHEM.
BUT IF THIS LADY WANTS TO SPENDTHANKSGIVING WITH HER FAMILY,
WHO CAN BLAME HER? TURNS OUTEVERYBODY.
>> THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY THATTHEY HAVE A JOB TO WORK AT.
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALITTLE CAPITALISM?
>> IF KMART WANTS TO OPEN UP ONTHANKSGIVING, LET THEM OPEN UP
ON THANKSGIVING.
>> RICHARD WRITES TO US, HE SAYSYOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME LADY.
JUST GO TO WORK.
YOU CAN CELEBRATE BY EATING ATURKEY SANDWICH WHILE ON BREAK.
SURE.
THANKSGIVING IS JUST AS GOODEATING A COLD SANDWICH ALONE IN
THE BACK OF A K MART.
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED CRANBERRYSAUCE, YOU CAN SEASON IT WITH
YOUR TEARS.
BUT THIS YEAR IT'S NOT JUSTEMPLOYEES GETTING SCREWED INTO
WORKING ON THANKSGIVING, IT'STHE STORES TOO.
>> STORES AT THE WALDEN GALLERIAHAVE A TOUGH CHOICE THIS YEAR.
OPEN ON THANKSGIVING OR POSSIBLYPAY A LOT OF MONEY IN FINES AND
PENALTIES.
>> YOU'RE TAXING STORES FOROBSERVING THANKGIVING.
THAT'S THE MOST ANTI-AMERICANTHING I EVER HEARD.
IT'S LIKE SHARIA LAW FORCAPITALISM.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KICK GEORGEWASHINGTON IN THE NUTS>
BUT IF NO ONE CARES WHEN STORESFORCE EMPLOYEES TO WORK ON
THANKSGIVING, WHO IS GOING TOSHED A TEAR WHEN MALLS FORCE
STORES TO STAY OPEN.
>> THE MALL IN UPSTATE NEW YORKIS STRONG ARMING ITS RETAILERS
INTO OPENING ON THANKSGIVING.
SO MUCH FOR THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT.
>> SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU CAN'T MAKE A STORE OPEN ONTHANKSGIVING.
IT'S JUST A POOR HELPLESSCORPORATION.
BUT PEOPLE?
PUNCH IN AND SHUT THE [BLEEP]UP.
YOU CAN SEE YOUR FAMILY INJANUARY.
JON.
>> Jon:  THANK YOU, LEWIS.
LEWIS BLACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
