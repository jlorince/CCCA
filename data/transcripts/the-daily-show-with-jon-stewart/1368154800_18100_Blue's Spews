ANYHEW, AS WE TALKED ABOUT
ON THIS PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY,
REPUBLICANS HAVE FINALLY
RELIZED IF THEY WISH TO EVER
GO AGAIN GO TO THE WHITE
HOUSE ON A NONVISITOR PASS
BASIS, THEY NEED TO DO I
ABETTER JOB OF APPEALING TO
WOMEN AND MINORITIES.
AND BY BETTER JOB, I MEAN
JOB.
REALLY, ANY APPEAL TO THEM
WHAT SOPH EVER WOULD HELP.
THAT BEING SAID, THAT
DOESN'T MEAN DEMOCRATS CAN
TAKE THEIR LONG-STANDING
RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE
GROUPS FOR GRANTED.
FOR INSTANCE YOUR SOUTH
CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN
DICK HARPOOTLIAN, LAST WEEK
INTRODUCING THE MAN HE HOPES
WILL DEFEAT SOUTH CAROLINA
GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY THROUGH
THE PURPOSES OF WHAT ARE YOU
ABOUT TO LEAR IS AN INDIAN
AMERICAN WOMAN.
>> NOW AT THIS TIME I WOULD
LIKE TO INTRODUCE, NOW DO I
CALL HIM SENATOR OR WOULD I
CALL HIM GOVERNOR SHEHEEN W
WHAT I DO CALL HIM?
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
AND ABOUT 18 MONTHS FROM NOW
HOPEFULLY HE WILL HAVE SENT
NIKKI HALEY BACK TO WHEREVER
THE HELL SHE CAME FROM.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: SO LET'S GIVE A WARM
WELCOME TO VINCENT SHE
HAN-- SHEHEEN WHO MUST NOW
TACITLY ENDORSE WAY JUST
SAID BY TAKING ITS STAGE.
IF HE DID MEAN GO BACK TO
WREFER THE HELL SHE CAME
FROM MEANING INDIA, THAT IS
SURPRISING COMING FROM DICK
HARPOOTLIAN A SECRETARY
IMMIGRATION IMMIGRANT FROM
THE COUNTRY OF HAR POOTEL.
-- A COUNTRY NAMED OF COURSE
FOR ITS CHIEF EXPORT HARP
POODLES.
THAT'S-- OKAY, THAT'S
STUPID.
EVERYONE KNOWS A HARP POODLE
IS A CROSS BETWEEN A POODLE
AND A HARP SEAL.
YES.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS WHAT THEY LOOK--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NOW WE'VE COME TO
THE AGE OLD POST
INFLAMMATORY COMMENT RIDDLE.
WILL HARPOOTLIAN SEEK HIM
OUT OR BURY HIM FURTHER.
>> I APOLOGIZE, YESTERDAY IF
ANYONE INFERRED, I MEAN I'M
THE GRANDSON OF IMMIGRANTS.
I CERTAINLY WASN'T-- SHE'S
NOT FROM INDIA.
SHE'S FROM BAMBURG, SOUTH
CAROLINA WHERE SHE WAS AN
ACCOUNTANT IN HER PARENT'S
CLOTHING STORE CALLED
EXOTICA.
AND ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS
SHE NEEDS TO GO BACK TO
BEING AN ACCOUNTANT IN A
DRESS STORE.
>> Jon: HE WASN'T DOING THE
NATIVIST GO BACK TO WHERE
YOU CAME FROM, FOREIGNER.
HE WAS DOING THE CHAUVINIST
LADIES BELONG KEEPING THE
BOOKS IN DRESS STORES.
(LAUGHTER)
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC
PARTY CHAIRMAN HARPOOTLIAN,
YOU'RE LOSING WOMEN.
NORTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC
CHAIRMAN PARTY CHAIRMAN,
SHOW HIM HOW IT IS DONE.
>> HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE
DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF GUILFORD
COUNTY LAST NIGHT.
WELL, IT THIS TWEET CAUSED
QUITE A STIR.
THE GOP THAT IS LEADING US,
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE
TAKING US BUT THEY'RE RAPING
US ALONG THE WAY, HE
REPORTEDLY SAID.
>> Jon: AM I RIGHT, LADIES,
RAPING US, RIGHT, RIGHT!
SHE KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.
THEY'RE RAPING US!
OF COURSE HE LATER
APOLOGIZED WITH THE FAMED
NOT INTENDING TO OFFEND AND
EXPLAINED WHY IT WAS AN APT
AND APPROPRIATE METAPHOR FOR
HIM TO USE IN FRONT OF A
WOMEN'S GROUP BY SAYING
WOMEN AND MEN WITH BATT
VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND-- I
PERSONALLY COULD HAVE BEEN
RAPED.
SO I GUESS WE'RE ALL GOOD,
HOW, LADIES?
HERE'S HOW WE KNOW YOU
PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN RAPED.
YOU USED THE TERM TO
DESCRIBE POLITICAL POLICIES
YOU DISAGREE WITH.
WHICH BRINGS TO US OUR FINAL
DEMOCRATIC ENT RAN.
>> NEIGHBORS HERE ARE
CALLING FOR THE RESIGNATION
OF TOWNSHIP CLERK DOLLARIA
PLAQUEO, PLAQUEO WAS
REPORTED CALLING SUPERVISOR
DWAYNE PARKER THE "N" WORD.
FLATCO IS APOLOGIZING FOR
WHAT SHE CALLS A SLIP OF THE
TONGUE.
>> Jon: HERE IS WHAT I FOUND
ABOUT THE N WORD, PRETTY
HARD TO SAY.
DOESN'T JUST SLIP OUT UNLESS
YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF
PRACTICE.
BUT LET'S HEAR THE TAPE.
>> HE'S JUST RUBBING ME THE
WRONG WAY.
HE IS JUST DOING WHATEVER HE
CAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF
MR. -- RIGHT NOW, I KNOW ARE
YOU NOT EVEN GOING LIKE THIS
HE'S JUST AN ARROGANT
NIGGER.
>> Jon: IF THAT WAS THE SLIP
OF THE TONGUE WHAT WERE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE
THIS, HE'S AN EXTRAVAGANT
GOLD DIGGER.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE
HEARING THIS, HE'S A HARROWING
TIGGER, SHE'S AN ASTRONAUT
NINJA.
SCREENPLAY IDEA, ASTRONAUT
NINJAS.
ZERO GRAVITY.
ZERO RULES.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A SLIP
OF THE TONGUE BECAUSE YOU
KNOW, THIS LADY SHE'S NOT
LIKE THAT, RIGHT.
>> I HAVE EATEN THANKSGIVING
DINNER WITH BLACK FRIENDS AT
THEIR HOUSE, SO NO, I'M FAR
FROM BECOME PREJUDICED.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO SAY
ANYTHING BUT PRETTY MUCH AT
EVERY THANKSGIVING I HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN THERE IS ALWAYS
AT LEAST ONE RACIST AT THE
TABLE SO IF YOU ARE AT
THANKSGIVING AND DON'T THINK
ANYONE ELSE THERE IS RACIST,
YOU'RE THE RACIST.
BY THE WAY, HERE'S MY
IMPRESSION--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HERE'S MY IMPRESSION
AT THANKSGIVING AT THE HOME
OF GLORIA PLATKO'S BLACK
FRIEND.
>> GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF MY
HOUSE!
(LAUGHTER)
JUST A LITTLE ADVICE TO
DEMOCRATS, ON YOUR WAY HOME
TONIGHT MAYBE PICK UP A
BOUQUET OF ROSES OR TWO
BECAUSE I DONE THINK WOMEN
AND MINORITIES ARE GOING TO
LEAVE YOU JUST YET BUT I
WOULDN'T GET
