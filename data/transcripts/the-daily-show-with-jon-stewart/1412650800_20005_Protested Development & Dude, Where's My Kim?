MASSIVE, ANTI-GOVERNMENTRALLY TO LISTLESS TEEN
HANG SESSION.

DAYS LIKE THESE.

TIME DESIGNING THAT COVER.VARIOUS COLORS AND THINGS.
SO WHAT WAS THE UMBRELLAREVOLUTION PROTESTING, ANYWAY?
>> THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR WHATTHEY CALL A FULL DEMOCRACY.
THEY WANT THE RIGHT TO BEABLE TO ELECT THEIR OWN
LEADERS.
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INBEIJING SAYS SURE, THEY CAN
HAVE ELECTIONS BUT THEY CANONLY VOTE FOR CANDIDATES
THAT HAVE BEEN PREAPPROVEDBY BEIJING.
>> Jon: OH ALRIGHT WELL, THATMAKES SENSE, I MEAN WHAT GOOD IS
AN ELECTION IF ALL THECANDIDATES ARE THE SAME?
IT'S LIKE CHOOSING WHATEVER YOUWANT FOR BREAKFAST WHEN
YOU'RE AT DENNY'S.
WHAT, DO YOU GOT? THE ALLAMERICAN SLAM, THE LUMBER JACK
SLAM, THE GRAND SLAM-WICH --IT'S JUST, IT'S ALL EGGS, TOAST,
AND MEAT SOAKED INHUMAN MISSERY.
THAT'S ALL IT IS.
(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER)
PROBABLY GONNA GET A GIFT BASKETFROM ARBY'S AFTER THAT.
HONG KONGERS WERE ALSOPROTESTING INCOME INEQUALITY,
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY ANDUNION ISSUES.
AND I THINK WE KNOW FROMEXPERIENCE HOW ROWDY THAT
KIND OF THING CAN GET.
>> HONG KONG PROTESTS NOWREALLY PUT THE CIVIL BACK IN
THE CIVIL OBEDIENCE.
>> THERE IS A VERY, VERYSORT OF COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE.
>> HOT DRINKS AND SNACKS.
>> PEOPLE WHO ARE GOINGAROUND COLLECTING GARBAGE
AND RECYCLING WHEN THEY CAN.
>> CHINA-- CHINA, YOU'VESURPASSED US ONCE MORE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. FIRSTTHE CHINESE BEAT US AT
BUSINESS WITH ALIBABA.
NOW THEY ARE DOING PROTESTSBETTER THAN US.
THEY ARE BEATING US AT BOTHTHE OCCUPY AND THE WALL
STREET.
IT'S NOT FAIR!
EVEN THE POLICE HAVE BEENMINDING THEIR MANNERS.
HERE THEY ARE OFFERINGHELPFUL SIGNAGE TO ALERT
PASSERBIES THEY ARE ABOUT TOBE TEAR GASSED.
VERY THOUGHTFUL, RIGHT?
AND HERE IS AN OFFICERPOLITELY GETTING THE
ATTENTION OF AN OLDERGENTLEMAN.

WHAT KIND OF COMMUNISTS ARETHESE PEOPLE?
EVEN PARIS HILTON IS LIKE TAKEIT DOWN A NOTCH.
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW ARE
THESE PROTESTS PLAYING INTHE MAINLAND OF CHINA?
>> THIS IS WHAT CHINESEVIEWERS OF CNBC SAW DURING
ITS RECENT COVERAGE OF THEHONG KONG PROTESTS.
ON BBC 2 THE SCREEN WENT TOBLACK.
CHINESE AUTHORITIES AREWORKING TO KEEP IMAGES OF
THE PROTESTS IN HONG KONGOFF TV ON THE MAINLAND.
>> Jon: SO YOU JUST GO TOBLACK.
YOU JUST-- PEOPLE WATCHINGAND THEY'RE JUST LIKE OH.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN IF IT'S JUST A BLACK
SCREEN, EVERY SHOW ONCHINESE TELEVISION IS A
POTENTIAL LAST EPISODE OFTHE SOPRANOS, IT JUST GOES
TO BLACK. I BET WHEN THESOPRANOS FINALE AIRED IN
CHINA THEY WERE ALL LIKE OH,I GUESS TONY WAS SITTING
DOWN WITH HIS FAMILY TODISCUSS ANTI-GOVERNMENT
PROTESTS.
THAT'S A WEIRD ENDING.
OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMESTO OFFICIAL OBFUSCATION
CHINA'S GOT NOTHING ON THEMASTER.
N TO THE ORTH, TO THE KOREA.
>> IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE MORETHAN A MONTH SINCE KIM JONG
UN HAS BEEN SPOTTED IN THEPUBLIC.
>> IT IS ASSUMED THAT HE IS INPOOR HEALTH OR IS HAVING HEALTH
ISSUES.
THE STATE RUN MEDIA HAS SAIDTHAT HE HAS QUOTE DISCOMFORT.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT.
DISCOMFORT.
HERE'S MY TAKE, OL' KIM JONGUN WENT TO THE HOSPITAL, WITH
A CANISTER OF AXE BODY SPRAYSTUCK UP HIS ASS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE DOCTORWAS LIKE WHAT'S THIS.
AND KIM JONG UN'S LIKE IDON'T KNOW, I WAS FRESHENING UP
AND I FELL. AND ICERTAINLY WASN'T
TRYING TO PUT AN AXE BODY SPRAYUP MY ASS.
AND THE DOCTOR IS LIKE WELLWHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT ON THE
FORM? AND THEN KIM JONG UN ISLIKE WELL DON'T FILL IT OUT.
JUST PUT IT'S JUST DISCOMFORT.
I'LL PAY CASH.
IT'S FINE.
ANY MORE SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS?

ANKLES.

KNOW, HE'S GOT [BLEEP] GOINGON WITH HIS FEET, I DON'T
KNOW.(LAUGHTER)
GOUT, BROKENANKLES, MAYBE HE'S PREGNANT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL.
SO THE SUPREME LEADER IS LAIDUP DUE TO GOUTY, DISCOMFORTING,
BROKEN ANKLES, PROBABLY DOESN'TMEAN ANYTHING.
>> THE MAN WHO IS CONSIDEREDTO BE SECOND IN COMMAND IN
NORTH KOREA AFTER THE LEADERKIM JONG UN POPPED DOWN TO
SOUTH KOREA FOR A LASTMINUTE VISIT.
THIS VISIT WAS BOTHSURPRISING AND SIGNIFICANT.
THE NORTH KOREANS AGREED TOANOTHER RANK OF HIGH LEVEL
TALKS FOR THE END OF THEMONTH OR THE START OF THE
NEXT MONTH.
>> Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]! NORTHKOREA, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT. KIM JONGUN DISAPPEARS WITH DISCOMFORT,
AND NORTH KOREA GOES TO SOUTHKOREA TO START TALKING?
I'M BEGINNING TO THINKTHIS DISCOMFORT IS LESS MY
TUMMY HURTS AND MORE OF AQUIETLY TOPPLED IN A COUP-ACHE.
(LAUGHTER)SOMEWHERE KIM JONG UN IS
YELLING THROUGH A BARREDDOORWAY AT ARMED GUARDS,
COME ON.
I BROUGHT YOU RODMAN -- WHATMORE CAN YOU ASK FROM A
CHILD KING?
AS MENTIONED BEFORE, NORTHKOREA WROTE THE BOOK ON
NONREPORTING THE NEWS.

UPSTATE WHERE THE CLOUDS AREMADE OF COOL WHIP AND HE CAN
SPEND ALL DAY SHOOTING MISSILESAT THINGS AND MAKING LOVE TO
DALLAS COWBOY CHEERLEADERS,ALL HAIL THE IMMORTAL KIM
