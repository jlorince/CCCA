>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS I WIND DOWN MY TIME HERE,I LEAVE THIS SHOW KNOWING
THAT MOST OF THE WORLD'SPROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED BY
US, THE DAILY SHOW.
BUT SADLY, THERE ARE STILLSOME DARK CORNERS THAT ARE
BROOM OF JUSTICE HAS NOTREACHED YET.
UNTIL NOW, JORDAN KLEPPER'SREPORT.
>> IN TODAY'S "PC WORLD" ITSEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS
TRYING TO BE A BIT MORETOLERANT.
BUT IN ONE STUBBORN TOWN INRURAL RED STATE ARKANSAS,
DISCRIMINATION IS ON THE RISE.
WORST OF ALL, THE LOCAL CITYCOUNCIL REFUSES TO OPEN
THEIR EYES TO THE TOWN'SBIGOSTRY.
>> WE DO NOT DISCRIMINATE INEUREKA SPRINGS.
EVERYBODY IS ACCEPTED FORWHO THEY ARE.
IF YOU ARE A SEVEN FOOT TALLMAN AND YOU WANT TO PARADE
IN TOWN BAREFOOT WEARING APURPLE DRESS, THAT'S FINE.
>> OH, REALLY?
TELL THAT TO LOCAL RESIDENTRANDALL CHRISTIE.
>> THERE IS DISCRIMINATIONEVERYWHERE, THERE ALWAYS HAS
BEEN.
I DOUBT THERE EVER WILL BE ATIME WHEN THERE'S NOT
DISCRIMINATION.
>> YOU ARE FACING DISCRIMINATIONHERE BECAUSE YOU'RE... JEWISH?
>> NO, I'M FACING DISCRIMINATIONHERE BECAUSE --
>> YOU'RE BLACK?
>> I PASTOR A CHURCH.
>> SO THE PEOPLE BEINGDISCRIMINATED AGAINST HERE
ARE CHRISTIANS?
>> YES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IN ARKANSAS WHERE CHRISTIANSMAKE UP A MEAGER 86% OF THE
POPULATION, PASTOR CRISTIEFEELS DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE
EUREKA SPRINGS PASSEDORDINANCE 2223.
>> THE ORDINANCE PROHIBITSDISCRIMINATION BASED ON A
PERSON'S SEXUAL ORIENTATIONAND GENDER IDENTITY.
>> YES, THIS BACKWARDS TOWNACTUALLY VOTED TO PROTECT
THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
>> I DID TAKE A VOCAL STANDAGAINST 2223.
THIS LAW DELIBERATELYDISCRIMINATES AGAINST THE
CHURCH.
THEY HAVE A PARAGRAPHREGULATING CHURCH HIRING
PRACTICES.
>> NOBODY IS TAKING AWAY THECHURCH'S RIGHT TO DO
ANYTHING.
THEY ARE NOT A PART OF THISORDINANCE.
THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED IN THISORDINANCE.
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TODO WITH CHURCHES.
>> OKAY, THOUGH THE CHURCHIS EXCLUDED FROM THIS LAW
AND PASTOR CHRISTIE CAN HIREANYONE HE WANTS.
WHILE THE TOWN DIDN'T TAKEAWAY HIS CHURCH OR BAN
PUBLIC DISPLAYS OFCHRISTIANITY OR SHUT DOWN
HIS ENORMOUS PASSION PLAY ORREMOVE HIS 66 FOOT CHRIST OF
THE OZARK STATUE OR STOP HIMFROM EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN
LOCAL PAPERS, ONLINE ANTHROUGH ADS PLASTERS AROUND
TOWN, HE IS STILL UNDERATTACK.
>> WHEN WE PASSED ORDINANCE2223, THE RELIGIOUS
CONSERVATIVES WERE SO UP SETABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE
ANTI-GAY.
THEY DESCENDED ON US LIKE APLAGUE OF LOCUSTS.
>> OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, YOUCAN'T USE PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS.
THAT'S A BIBLE THING.
THAT'S NOT YOURS.
>> OKAY.
>> AND SECONDLY, WHY ARE YOUBEING SO MEAN TO THESE POOR
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.
>> THESE POOR RELIGIOUSPEOPLE ARE MEAN TO US.
THEY WRITE LETTERS TO THEEDITOR.
THEY MARCH UP AND DOWN THESTREET HOLDING SIGNS SAYING
DIVORCE IS EVIL.
>> MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE THEYHAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE
NIGHT MARRISH HELLSCAPE SINPALACE THUNDER DOME OF GAY
THAT IS EUREKA SPRINGS.
>> THE ENERGY OF DOWNTOWN INYOUR EXPERIENCE HAS CHANGED
A LOT SINCE THE INFLUX OFLGBT, IT REALLY HAS.
THERE USED TO BE MORE FAMILY-ORIENTED SHOPS THAN THERE
ARE NOW.
>> WHAT ARE THE TYPES OFSHOPS THAT HAVE COME UP THAT
ARE MORE GAY ORIENTED, LESSFAMILY ORIENTED?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THERE'S A FEW.
>> WE DON'T HAVE OPENDISPLAYS OF HOMOSEXU--
-- HOW DO YOU OPENLY DISPLAYTHAT ARE YOU HOMOSEXUAL?
>> YOU OPEN UP GAY STORES.
>> WE DON'T HAVE-- WE HAVESTORES THAT ARE OWNED BY GAY
PEOPLE, BUT THEY'RE NOT GAYSTORES.
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTANDWHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
>> WELL, THERE ARE STORESTHAT SELL LIKE INTERESTING
RUGS.
>> A RUG.
>> IN YOUR FACE LESBIANISM,OR WHAT ABOUT THAT CUTE
LITTLE GELLATO STORE, WHICHTHAT SCREAMS IN YOUR FACE,
"ACCEPT ME NOW" HOMOSEXUALITY.
>> GELATO, THAT IS KIND OF ANICE CREAM, ICE CREAM IS-- NOT
GENDER NEUTRAL?
>> THESE LAWS THAT PROTECTGENDER EXPRESSION ALLOW
BIOLOGICAL MALES TO GOWHEREVER THEY WANT,
BIOLOGICAL FEMALES TO GOWHEREVER THEY WANT, DEPENDING
ON HOW THEY ARE EXPRESSINGTHEIR GENDER THAT DAY.
IT IS HAPPENING, YOU KNOW.
>> WHAT IS HAPPENING.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE THATWALK THAT THE REST ROOMS AND
SOMEONE IN THE OPPOSITE SEXIS IN THAT RESTROOM.
>> DOING WHAT?
>> EVIDENTLY USING THE RESTROOM.
>> AND THEN WHAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S APROBLEM FOR SOME PEOPLE.
>> I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR SUREWHAT BATHROOMS HAVE TO DO
WITH THIS.
BUT FOR SOME REASON,CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS
PEOPLE ARE TERRIBLEABLY HUNGUP ON BATHROOMS.
>> SADLY FOR CHRISTY, THEANTI-DISCRIMINATION
ORDINANCE IS BACKED BY THEVAST MAJORITY OF LOCAL
RESIDENTS, AND HE IS UNABLETO ESCAPE THE CONSTANT
REMINDER OF THE LGBT'SPRESENCE.
>> THEY START PUSHING THEIRLIFESTYLE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
FACES.
>> THEY HANG OUT THEIR FLAG.
YOU KNOW, THE OLD ADAGE OFHANGING OUT YOUR SHINGLE.
>> YEAH.
IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE IT ISJUST LOOMING OVER YOU.
>> EVERYWHERE YOU GO.
