YOGURT.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY AASIF
MANDVI LIVE IN ATHENS.
ASSIF, HOW DID EUROPE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FIRST OF ALL, HOW DOES THIS
AFFECT EUROPE?
FIRST OF ALL, HOW DID EUROPE NOT
KNOW THAT GREECE WAS IN THIS
TYPE OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE?
>> WELL, JON, IT'S FASCINATING.
TEN YEARS AGO WHEN GREECE
REALIZED THAT TO COVER EVEN AT
THAT TIME THEIR BIG DEFICIT,
THEY WERE GOING TO NEED AN
INFLUX OF CASH, THEY WERE VERY
SMART.
THEY CALLED AN AMERICAN
INVESTMENT BANK.
>> Jon: LET ME GUESS --
GOLDMAN SACHS.
>> VERY GOOD.
GOLDMAN SACHS CAME UP WITH A WAY
TO HIDE THE EXTENT OF GREECE'S
DEBT SO EUROPEAN BANKS WOULD
CONTINUE LENDING TO GREECE, AND
GREEK PEOPLE COULD CONTINUE
RETIRING A FEW YEARS AFTER
PUBERTY.
[LAUGHTER]
THE DEVICE THEY USED TO DO IT
WAS CALLED "A CURRENCY SWAP."
>> Jon: OH, OKAY, SO THE
EUROPEAN BANKS WHO BOUGHT THESE
SWAPS THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING
SOMETHING FISCALLY SOUND WHEN
THEY WERE, IN THE PARLANCE OF
WALL STREET...
>> OH, JON, MAY I?
>> Jon: HORSE [BLEEPED], YEAH,
YEAH.
SO NOW THE EUROPEAN BANKS ARE IN
TROUBLE.
>> YES, BUT AFTER THEY BOUGHT
THE GREEK BONDS, EUROPE DID
SOMETHING VERY SMART.
JUST ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT THE
BONDS THAT THEY GOT FROM GREECE
CONTAINED HORSE [BLEEPED], THEY
TRANSFERRED THE RISK OF THESE
BONDS TO A THIRD PARTY USING A
DEVICE THAT COULD MAKE MATH THE
RISK OF THESE TRANSACTIONS
CALLED CREDIT DEFAULT...
>> Jon: MAY I?
SWAPS.
>> SWAPS.
EXACTLY.
>> Jon: WHO WAS THE THIRD
PARTY?
>> WELL, THAT IS THE BEAUTIFUL
THING ABOUT THIS.
BECAUSE OF OUR INABILITY TO
REGULATE THE SWAPS INDUSTRY, NO
ONE HAS ANY [BLEEPED] IDEA.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: MAYBE AMERICAN BANKS,
INCLUDING THE SAME ONES WHO
ORIGINALLY HELPED GREECE CREATE
THESE HORSE [BLEEPED] SWAPS?
>> WELL, IS WHATLG THE SMART
MONEY SAYS, OR IN WALL STREET
PARLANCE,
