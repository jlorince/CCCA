PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, SENATOR RAND PAUL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HAVE SOME WATER, I KNOW YOU MUSTBE TIRED.
WHAT WAS THAT, 11 HOURS OFFILIBUSTERING.
YOU GOTTA BE EXHAUSTED.
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
CAN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM?
DO YOU GET 30 SECONDS, CAN YOUGO?
>> NO, YOU HAVE TO STAND THEWHOLE TIME.
YOU CANNOT SIT DOWN OR LEAVE THEFLOOR.
>> Jon: CAN YOU HAVE ASUBSTITUTE COME IN FOR JUST
A MINUTE?
>> NO.
NOW, THERE  A STORY OF STROMTHURMAN ONCE UPON A TIME GOING
TO THE CLOAK ROOM DOOR ANDRELIEVING HIMSELF INTO A WASTE
BUCKET.
>> Jon: THERE ARE A LOT OFSTORIES ABOUT STROM THURMAN.
THAT MIGHT BE THE NICEST ONE.
>> BUT THE THING IS THAT WASBEFORE TV -- AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO IMPRESS THEM, YOU KNOW, WITHTHE EOMITION THING.
>> Jon: YEAH, I GET THAT.
RESPECT.
THIS IDEA, BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW,YOUR PARTY IS KNOWN FOR WANTING
TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE OF AMERICAFROM GOVERNMENT OVERREACH,
TO PROTECT LIBERTY, I BELIEVETHEY CALL IT, THEY HAVE SIGNS --
(LAUGHTER)
-- "DON'T TREAD ON ME" FLAGS.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENTSURVEILLANCE, WHEN IS COMES TO
THE SECURITY STATE, THEY SEEMVERY WILLING TO ALLOW THE
GOVERNMENT, WITH WHAT APPEARS TOBE VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT, TO GET
WHATEVER THEY WANT.
>> YOU DIDN'T SEE THE OTHER SIGNTHEY HAVE?
WE DON'T LIKE BIG GOVERNMENTUNTIL WE DO LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT, BUT THAT'S MYPOINT.
>> YEAH, THERE IS ANINCONSISTENCY THERE AND I THINK
THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES SOME OF USWHO ARE MORE FROM THE
LIBERTARIAN WING OF THEREPUBLICAN PARTY.
WE DON'T LIKE BIG GOVERNMENTANYWHERE.
>> Jon: NOW, IS THAT -- WHENYOU TALKING LIKE THAT, IS THAT
WHY LINDSEY GRAHAM ROLLS HISEYES, OR WERE YOU WEARING
WHITE BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY?
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT WAS IT THAT CAUSED HIM --AND WAS IN UNCOMFORTABLE --
DID THEY TAUNT YOU ABOUTTHAT?
DO THEY THINK, RAND, WHAT AREYOU DOING?
WHAT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> IT WAS MOSTLY, I THINK,PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT
DEBATING THE BILL OF RIGHTS WHENTHEY COULD HAVE BEEN ON
MEMORIAL WEEKEND, AND I THINKIT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE.
>> Jon:  IN TERMS OFGOVERNEMTN SURVEILLANCE, LET'S
LOOK AT WHERE THE MAJORITY AREAT --
THERE HAVE BEEN MORE SCHOOLSHOOTINGS, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
THAN TERRORISM IN AMERICA OVERTHE LAST 15 YEARS.
>> IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL, THOUGH,I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT
TERRORISM.
>> Jon: WE'RE NOT DISCOUNTING ITBUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT
REALISTICALLY.
>> THAT'S THE THING, RIGHT NOWTHEY'RE USING SCARE TACTICS
AGAINST ME.
THEY WANT ME TO BACK DOWNBECAUSE IF  ANYTHING HAPPENS, IF
ANYONE DIES FOR ANY REASON INTHE WHOLE WORLD, I'M NOW
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
14 PEOPLE DIED LAST NIGHT FROMMURDER IN BALTIMORE.
IS THE POLICE CHIEF RESPONSIBLEFOR THAT?
MAYBE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THEKILLING ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THE
REST OF US NEED TO PROTECTSECURITY BUT ALSO NEED TO
REALIZE WHAT WE'RE FIGHTINGAGAINST.
IF WE'RE FIGHTING THIS WARAGAINST TERRORISM WE'RE FIGHTING
TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS.
IF WE GIVE UP WHO WE ARE IN THEROCESS, I'M WORRIED WILL THE
BATTLE HAVE BEEN WORTH IT.
THE PROBLEM NOW IS WE ARE IN AWAR THEY SAY IS PERPETUAL.
THEY SAY THE BATTLEGROUND ISEVERYWHERE AND IT WILL GO ON
FOREVER, THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
AND SO WHEN ARE WE GETTING OURFREEDOMS BACK.
BUT I KNOW YOUNG MEN WHO HAVELOST TWO LEGS, YOU KNOW, LOST
THREE LIMBS, AND I ASK THEM WHATTHEY FOUGHT FOR AND THEY SAID
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR  BILL OFRIGHTS, SO I THINK IT'S A
DISSERVICE TO THEIR MEMORY FORME TO SAY, OH, WELL, I'M GOING
TO JUST ROLL MY EYES AND THEBILL OF RIGHTS IS OUT THE WINDOW
BECAUSE I'M NOT WILLING TO STAYHERE ON THE WEEKEND AND FIGHT
FOR SOMETHING OUR FOUNDINGFATHERS THOUGHT WAS
PRETTY IMPORTANT -- IMPORTANT TOPUT INTO THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.
>> Jon: I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'TFRAME THAT IN AN INFLAMMATORY
WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M THE KIND OF GUY WHO DOESN'TMIND WORKING A WEEKEND IF IT
MEANS OUR SOLDIERS DIDN'T DIEIN VAIN.
(APPLAUSE)
I GUESS LINDSEY GRAHAM'S ADIFFERENT KIND OF GUY.
WE'LL COME BACK, WE'LL TALK TOYOU MORE.
MORE WITH SENATOR RAND PAULRIGHT AFTER THIS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
