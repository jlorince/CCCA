( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT ROB CORDDRY.
COME ON!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HE JUST CAME BACK TO I THINK
GET A BAG OF WEED HE LEFT IN ANAIR DUCT LIKE 12 YEARS AGO.
BUT FIRST, OVER THE WEEKEND, NEWJERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
SPENT SOME OF HIS VERY VALUABLETIME MEETING WITH HIS MOST
VALUED CONSTITUENCY, IOWAAGRABUSINESS MULTI-MILLIONAIRE
BRUCE RASTETTER TO ASSURE THEVOTERS OF NOT NEW JERSEY THAT
HE, CHRISTIE, HAS THE CHOPS TOCUT THEM THE BEST TRADE DEALS.
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHTPERSON IN THE OVAL OFFICE
NEGOTIATING THESE AGREEMENTS.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW HOWTO NEGOTIATE.
>> Jon:  THE PRESIDENTDOESN'T KNOW HOW TO,
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'TKNOW HOW TO NEGOTIATE?
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,CHRISTIE, YOU THINK THAT
MILKTOAST CRITICISM OF THEPRESIDENT IS GOING TO GET YOU
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATIONS?
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEREPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
I BELIEVE THE CRITICISM YOU'RELOOKING FOR IS THE PRESIDENT
DOESN'T NEGOTIATE LIKE MOSTAMERICANS.
( LAUGHTER )THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T GROW UP
WITH BUY LOW-SELL HIGH AMERICANVALUES LIKE OUR PARENTS--
BENGHAZI.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING.
AND BY THE BY, CHRISTIE KNOWSNEGOTIATING, JUST TAKE A RECENT
EXAMPLE.
IN 2004, NEW JERSEY SUED EXXONFOR $9 BILLION IN RESTORATION
AND RESTITUTION RELATING TO THECHEMICAL ( BLEEP ) OF A LARGE
AREA OF NEW JERSEY THAT MANY OFYOU HAVE PROBABLY DRIVEN BY AND
THOUGHT, DID SATAN'S SKUNK GETDIARRHEA?
WELL IN 2006, THE COURT DECLAREDEXXON LIBEL FOR THE DAMAGES OF
THAT 2004 LAWSUIT AND THEN WENTHOME AND WATCH THE FIRST SEASON
OF "FRIDAYS NIGHT LIGHTS"BECAUSE IT WAS 2006.
FOR EIGHT YEARS, NEW JERSEY ANDITS TEAM OF LAWYERS BATTLED TO
DETERMINE JUST HOW MANY BILLIONSOF DOLLARS THEY WOULD SQUEEZE
THROUGH EXXON'S NOZZLE UNTILMASTER NEGOTIATOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
SHOWED UP AND SEALED THE DEAL.
>> EXXON AGREED TO PAY $225MILLION OVER CONTAMINATION AT
REFINERY SITES IN NEW JERSEY.
>> BEFORE THE JUDGE COULD DECIDEON DAMAGES, CHRISTIE'S
ADMINISTRATION SETTLED THE CASE.
>>THE FORMER STATE ENVIRONMENTALCOMMISSIONER SAID THAT
CHRISTIE'S CHIEF COUNSELINSERTED HIMSELF INTO THE CASE
AND CUT A DEAL FAVORABLE TOEXXON.
>> Jon:  BOOM!
200 AND-- WAIT WHAT?
WELL OKAY, $221 MILLION OUT OF 9BILLION, THREE CENTS ON THE
DOLLAR?
WELL, CHRISTIE SAID HE WAS AGREAT NEGOTIATOR.
HE DIDN'T SAY WHICH SIDE HE WASWORKING FOR.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, THE MORE-- THE MORESKEPTICAL AMONGST US MIGHT
IMMEDIATELY LOOK FOR SOMELINKAGE, TWIXT CHRIS CHRISTIE
AND EX EXXON.
>> EXXON CONTRIBUTED HEAVILY TOTHE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS
ASSOCIATION CHAIRED BY CHRISTIELAST YEAR.
HIS LAW FIRM ALSO HAS CLOSEPOLITICAL TIES TO THE
ADMINISTRATION.
>> Jon:  NOW, NOW, I KNOWTHAT LOOKS BAD-- NO, SERIOUSLY,
I KNOW THAT LOOKS BAD.
I KNOW MY INFLECTION IMPLIED ABUT, BUT I DON'T HAVE A BUT.
I HAVE A BUTT, I HAVE-- DAMNYOU, ENGLISH!
WHY MUST ONE OF YOUR MOSTIMPORTANT CONJUNCTIONS BE A
HOMONYM FOR MY TUSHY?
OH, TUSH.
ANYWAY, IF YOU'RE EXPECTINGCHRIS CHRISTIE TO GET ALL COCKY
AND CLAIM THAT HE DID ANEXCELLENT JOB NEGOTIATING THIS
( BLEEP ) DEAL, YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE $225MILLION WAS ALL WE GOT, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
WRONG.
225 MILLION IS ON TOP OF WHATTHEY HAVE TO PAY TO FIX WHAT
THEY POLLUTED.
AND THERE IS NO CAP.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT, WHATHE'S SAYING, THAT IS TRUE.
BUT--( LAUGHTER )
HOWEVER, THAT EXXON HAS TO FIXWHAT THEY POLLUTED WITH NO CAP
STIPULATION COMES FROM ACOMPLETELY SEPARATE 1991 CONSENT
ORDER THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE2004 LAWSUIT.
HE'S CONFLATING THEM.
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TOKNOW THAT.
( LAUGHTER )YES.
CHRIS CHRISTIE, YOUR AMAZINGNEGOTIATING SKILLS WILL GET
NEW JERSEY A LOT LESS MONEY THANALMOST ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH
THIS CASE, INCLUDING EXXONTHOUGHT IT WOULD GET.
UNLESS YOU'RE SUCH A GOODNEGOTIATOR YOU'RE ALSO TAKING
CREDIT FOR THE 1991 DEAL, INWHICH CASE, WHY STOP THERE?
ALSO IN '91, I PENNED A LITTLETUNE CALLED "EVERYBODY DANCE
NOW." PERHAPS YOU'VEDANCED TO THE
CHRIS AND CHRISTIE MUSIC FACTORYSONG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER )
NOW, IT'S NOT-- I FORGOT HOW INSHAPE THAT FACTORY WAS.
( LAUGHTER )WELL, LOOK, IT'S A LOT LESS
MONEY THAN NEW JERSEY THOUGHTTHEY WERE GETTING BUT AT LEAST
IT'S SOMETHING FOR THE CLEANUP.
>> CHRISTIE'S ALREADY USED THEBULK OF THE COURT SETTLEMENT
INTENDED TO CLEAN UP THE PASSAICRIVER ON MONEY TO PLUG HOLES IN
HIS CURRENT REVENUE-STARVEDBUDGET.
>> Jon:  WELL, ON THE BRIGHTSIDE, THE FISH IN THAT RIVER
HAVE MUTATED SO SEVERELY,THEY'RE STARTING TO DO THE
CLEANUP THEMSELVES.
( APPLAUSE )QUICK QUESTION THOUGH, HONESTLY,
HOW CAN CHRISTIE DO THAT?
>> GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE CANUSE A LAW HE PROPOSED LAST YEAR
TO STEER THE EXXON MONEY TOBALANCE HIS STATE'S BUDGET GAP
INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT TOWARDSENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION.
>> Jon:  DAMN, IT FEELS GOODTO BE A GOVERNOR.
( LAUGHTER )THANK YOU GETO BOYS.
NOW, CHRIS CHRISTIE' SWEETHEART
EXXON DEAL ISN'T THE ONLYPOLLUTANT BUBBLING UP OUT OF THE
SWAMPS OF JERSEY.
>> FEDERAL CORRUPTION CHARGESMAY BE IMMINENT.
ROBERT MENENDEZ, A DEMOCRAT FROMNEW JERSEY.
>> TOOK CAMPAIGN CASH AND GIFTSFROM THIS FLORIDA EYE DOCTOR,
SALOMON MELGEN. THEFEDS WANT TO KNOW IF THE
SENATOR THEN IMPROPERLY USED HISOFFICE
TO TRY TO HELP THE EYE DOCTORGET A PORT SECURITY DEAL IN THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, A DEALPOTENTIALLY WORTH TENS OF
MILLIONS.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, ALLRIGHT, MAYBE CHRIS CHRISTIE'
THING ISN'T ILLEGAL, BUT COME ONCAMPAIGN CASH AND GIFTS FOR YOU,
PORT DEAL FOR YOU?
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO ACORRUPT FLORIDA OPHTHALMOLOGIST
TO SEE THIS IS CLASSICCORRUPTION.
>> LOTS OF SENATORS FLY LOTS OFPLACES FOR LOTS OF REASONS.
THEY DO FAVORS FOR POLITICALDONORS ALL THE TIME.
>> THE FACT THAT HE RECEIVEDCONTRIBUTIONS FROM DR. MELGEN,
THE FACT THAT HE DID THINGS FORHIM,
THOSE TWO THINGS ALONE ARE NOTENOUGH.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO SHOW ALINK-UP.
>> THE QUID PRO QUO THAT THEGIFTS HE RECEIVED WERE THE
REASONS HE DID THESE FAVORS FORTHE DOCTOR.
>> Jon:  WHAT ELSE COULD ITBE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S AQUID-PRO-COINCIDENCE?
WHICH BRINGS TONIGHT'S PLAY TOITS DENOUEMENT.
OUR POLITICS ARE SO SICK,SYMPTOMS WE USED TO READILY
IDENTIFY AS EVIDENCE OFCUT AND DRY CORRUPTION
ARE NOW SHRUGGED OFF ASIT'S A FUZZY LINE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WE'RE THAT CHRONICALLY ILL.
UNLESS THE CORRUPTION JUMPSDIRECTLY OFF A THOMAS NAST
TEAR SHEET, HANDLE BAR MUSTACHEGUY, BAG OF MONEY SIGN IN
EXCHANGE FOR HANDLEBARMOUSTACHE WAX CONTRACT,
THEN WE DON'T THINKIT'S CORRUPTION.
AND THIS ISN'T JUST A JERSEYTHING.
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PERFECTED ITTHERE.
THIS GOES TO EVERY LEVEL OFGOVERNMENT.
>> LEADERSHIP PACS ARE NOW THESECOND LARGEST POLITICAL REVENUE
STREAM FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,PERSONAL POLITICAL EXPENSE
ACCOUNTS FINANCED LARGELY BYLOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS
GROUPS.
>> LOBBYIST WORKING FOR THENATION'S BIGGEST BANKS ARE THE
ONES DRAFTING THOSE NEWFINANCIAL RULES.
>> TRUCKING LOBBY SUCCESSFULLYBLOCKED NEW SLEEP MINIMUMS FOR
DRIVERS, AND CITYBANK LOBBYISTSACTUALLY WROTE THE PROVISION
THAT WILL ROLL BACK RESTRICTIONSON BIG BANKS.
>> Jon: IT'S ( BLEEP )EVERYWHERE!
THE ONLY REASON THAT MENENDEZMIGHT FACE CHARGES IS HE
SHOWERED HIS FAVORS ON SOMESCHMUCK HE KNOWS INSTEAD OF A
CORPORATION OR LOBBYING GROUP.
IF ONLY HE'D SOLD INFLUENCE TOSOME SCHMUCK CO, HE'D PROBABLY
BE FINE, WHICH MAKES ME WONDERIF ALL THIS BACK-AND-FORTH IS
JUST STANDARD OPERATINGPROCEDURE WHY DID ANYONE LOOK
INTO THIS MENENDEZ THINGIN THE FIRST PLACE?
>> IN 2012, AN ANONYMOUS TIPSTERWAS PITCHING A STORY THAT
MENENDEZ HAD FLOWN IN MELGEN'SPRIVATE JET TO A DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC RESORT.
>> ALLEGATIONS MENENDEZ PAID FORSEX WITH PROSTITUTES IN THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
>> Jon:  OH, THERE'SPROSTITUTION IN THIS STORY.
( LAUGHTER )BUT I DON'T THINK THE
PROSTITUTES ARE FROM THEDOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
