>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
MY GUEST TONIGHT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOT WHAT WAS -- THAT WAS BUT I'M
ASSUMING IT WAS ANTISEMITIC.
MY GUEST TONIGHT AUGHT AUTHOR
BRUCE HENDERSON WROTE A BOOK
WITH ONE OF GREAT ESCAPE OF THE
VIETNAM WAR.
NOT TALKING ABOUT CHENEY'S FIVE
DEFERMENTS.
BOOM!
ACTUALLY HE'S BEEN OUT OF OFFICE
FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND
APPARENTLY IN THE HOSPITAL SO --
SORRY.
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN ARC --
WASHINGTON.
AS YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ON
THIS PROGRAM ABOUT HOW CONGRESS
CAN BE SOMEWHAT INEFFECTUAL OR
SHORT-SIGHTED OR IGNORANT FOR A
FETED POOL OF CORRUPTION AND
STUPIDITY LOCATED AT THE
INTERSECTION OF ENTITLEMENT
AVENUE AND DERELICTION LANE.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?
CONGRESS.
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.
LAST WEEK THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES TOOK UP A
PRESSING ISSUE WITH BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT.
>> TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP
TOWARDS ENSURING THAT THE
APPROPRIATE RESOURCES ARE
AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO TAKE
CARE OF THOSE WHO RISKED THEIR
LIVES TO SAVE ORIGINALS ON
SEPTEMBER 1 1-6R7B8G
MR. SPEAKER, OUR COMMITTEE CAN
DO GREAT WORK WHEN WE WORK
TOGETHER.
>> Jon: YES, WE CAN, AND WHAT
BETTER REASON TO WORK TOGETHER
THAN ON A BILL PROVIDING HEALTH
CARE FOR 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS
AND RELIEF WORKERS CURRENTLY
SUFFERING CHRONIC HEALTH
PROBLEMS DIRECTLY RELATED TO
THEIR BRAVE SERVICE?
IT'S ONE OF CONGRESS' FINEST
HOURS.
SORRY, SIR, I CUT YOU OFF.
CONTINUE.
>> MR. SPEAKER, OUR COMMITTEE
CAN DO GREAT WORK WHEN WE WORK
TOGETHER THIS, IS NOT ONE OF OUR
FINEST TIMES.
>> Jon: HEY WHAT THE -- WHAT?
WAIT, WAIT -- ARE YOU -- UNDER
WHAT -- ARE YOU OBJECTING TO
THIS BILL?
HOW?
WHY?
WHAT?
WET?
WICKER, WAAA?
YES, APPARENTLY THIS STORY FALLS
UNDER THE RUBRIC OF OUR BRAND
NEW SEGMENT:  I GIVE UP.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT NAYSAYERS LET'S HEAR
WHY YOU ARE AGAINST IT.
>> THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN
PAIRED WITH A FUNDAMENTALLY
FLAWED AND JOB DESTROYING TAX
INCREASE AND THEREFORE,LY VOTE
AGAINST IT -- AND THEREFORE I
WILL VOTE AGAINST IT.
>> Jon: THERE'S A TAX INCREASE
TO PAY FOR THIS.
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO
TRY TO PAY FOR THE BILL TO
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE
SUFFERING FOR THEIR HEROISM WITH
A TAX.
MY GUESS IS IT MUST BE AN
INCREDIBLY REPREHENSIBLE AND
ONEROUS TAX.
IS IT A TAX ON I DON'T KNOW,
BABIES?
IS IT A FINE FOR ACTS OF
KINDNESS.
IS IT A TARIFF ON PARENTS WHO
ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO RETAIN
THEIR VIRGINITY PAST THE AGE OF
14?
FOR A,, TOO, WOULD REJECT SUCH A
MEASURE OR IS THIS TAX JUST THE
CLOSING OF A LOOPHOLE TO
PREVENT -- QUOTE -- FOREIGN
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS
INCORPORATED IN TAX HAVEN
COUNTRIES FROM AVOIDING TAX ON
INCOME EARNED IN THE UNITED
STATES.
TRANSLATION, THE P.O. BOX ON
GRAND CAYMAN ISLAND AIN'T
FOOLING ANYBODY, JACK!
MY GUESS IS REPRESENTATIVE CAMP
FOUND HIMSELF DECAMPED FROM HIS
COLLEAGUES ON THIS ONE.
>> THEIR HEROISM THEMSELVES THEY
WENT THERE TO SAVE SURSWRIEFORS,
NO TO THE RAISE TAXES.
[AUDIENCE GROANS]
>> Jon: YOU FILL MY HEART WITH
SADNESS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I MEAN IF THEY -- I DON'T
EVEN -- HONESTLY I JUST DON'T --
I GUESS IF 9/11 RESPONDERS HAD
KNOWN TAXES MIGHT BE RAISED
BECAUSE OF THEIR HEROISM, I
IMAGINE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
QUITE A DIFFERENT SCENE ON 9/11.
THERE'S PEOPLE ON THE 90th
FLOOR BUT BEFORE I RUSH IN YOU
HAVE TO PROMISE ME AND MY FAMILY
THAT THIS WILL NOT EFFECT THE
SWISS COMPANY'S OFF SHORE TAX
STATUS.
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME THAT OR
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YIEWSH AN (bleep).
THIS IS MAKING ME ANGRY.
THIS IS MAKING ME ANGRY.
IT'S MAKING ME ANGRY AND I FEEL
LIKE SCREAMING BUT I'M UNSURE
ABOUT HOW FAR MY NECK VEINS CAN
SAFELY BULGE OUT OF MY NECK
BEFORE BLOOD SQUIRTS OVER MY
ENTIRELY INNOCENT AUDIENCE, SO
I'LL LET NEW YORK REPRESENTATIVE
AND THIS IS TRUE FORMER STEWART
NOT AS GAY AS IT SOUNDS SUMMER
SHARE PAL, ANTHONY WIENER, I'LL
LET HIM DO THE SCREAMING FOR ME.
>> YOU VOTE YES IF YOU BELIEVE
YES.
YOU VOTE IN FAVOR OF SOMETHING
IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT
THING INSTEAD OF STANDING UP AND
DEFENDING YOUR COLLEAGUES AND
VOTING NO ON THIS HUMANE BILL
YOU SHOULD URLG THEM TO VOTE
YES.
I WILL NOT YIELD TO THIS
GENTLEMAN.
IT IS A SHAME.
A SHAME!
THE GENTLEMAN WILL SIT.
THE GENTLEMAN IS CORRECT IN
SITTING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: NOW, IN NO WAY -- IN
NO WAY DO I EVEN IN DIMINISH HIS
PASSION ON THIS ISSUE BUT THAT
IS EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
WHEN YOU USED HIS PEANUT BUTTER.
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY
WILL PAY $1.50 FOR THAT JIFFY.
THE GENTLEMAN IS CORRECT IN
PAYING $1.50.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WITH THAT KIND OF PASSION ON THE
DEMOCRATS SIDE AND THE CLEAR
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THIS BILL WAS DEFEATED.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE VOTE
TOTAL.
RIGHT THERE.
THERE IT IS 255 DCH WAIT,
THERE'S 4-4-35 SEATS SO YOU NEED
218 TO PASS SO THAT -- THAT'S A
MAJORITY.
THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD,
BIG -- HOW DID THIS NOT PASS
AGAIN.
>> DEMOCRATS USED A PROCEDURE
WHICH REQUIRED A TWO-THIRDS VOTE
FOR PASSAGE.
THEY GOT A MAJORITY BUT THEY
DIDN'T GET THE VOTES NEEDED.
>> Jon: WHY THE (bleep)
WOULD YOU USE THAT?
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THIS HARDER,
DEMOCRAT?
>> THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO
AMEND THIS MONEY AND SAY, OKAY
YOU HAVE THIS $7 BILLION BUT
NONE OF IT CAN GO TO ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS FOR EXAMPLE WHO MIGHT
HAVE BEEN AT GROUND ZERO.
>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
WHAT THE -- OKAY, NO, THAT MAKES
SENSE.
IF YOU SPENT DAYS CRAWLING
THROUGH RUBBLE AND ASH INHALING
TOXIC FUMES TO SAVE THE LIVES
AND PAIN OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A WORK VISA
YOU ARE A NEED LOADING (bleep)
WHO DESERVES NOTHING.
WHY DON'T THE DEMOCRATS WITH
THEIR MAJORITY SAY I DON'T KNOW
VOTE SOMETHING LIKE THAT DOWN
UNDER THE ASP NINE AMENDMENTS
WON'T FLY ACT.
>> THEY DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE ON
THAT.
>> THEY WANTED TO PREVENT
REPUBLICANS OFFERING AMENDMENTS
ON THE FLOOR THAT THEY SAID
WOULD EMBARRASS THEM IN AN
ELECTION YEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: DID I MENTION THAT I
GIVE UP?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL IN A MEDIA CULTURE THAT
THROWS (bleep) FITS WHEN
SOMETHING AS MINOR AS ERYKAH BAD
U STRIPPING DOWN.
>> CAN YOU NOT WALK DOWN THE
SIDEWALK NOW WITHOUT BEING
FORCED TO SEE STRANGERS NUDE.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T WALK DOWN THE SIDEWALK
WITHOUT THAT HAPPENING.
IMAGINE THE SEISMIC PUNDIT
RIPPLES OF ANGER WHEN POLITICIAN
S PUT CRAVEN POLITICAL
EXPEDIENCE OVER THE WELL BEING
OF THE NATION'S DESERVING HEROS.
>> I DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULARS
OF THE BILL.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANTHONY
WIENER IS TALKING ABOUT.
HE'S SCREAMING AND IT'S SUCH A
TURNOFF.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: IS IT?
IS IT A TURNOFF?
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT FROM YOUR "PLAYBOY"
PROFILE MY TURNOFFS INCLUDING
WIENER SCREAMING AND IN ANY WAY
JUSTIFYING MY BEING TREATED AS
AND EXPERT?
[LAUGHTER]
IF CONGRESS CAN'T GET TWO-THIRDS
OF A VOTE MAJORITY FOR 9/11
HEALTH CARE, WHAT CAN THEY GET
TWO-THIRDS FOR?
LET'S SAY IN THE VERY SAME WEEK
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS DEBACLE.
>> PROTECTING GUN OWNERS WILL
ENSURE THAT FAMILIES CAN KEEP
THE PRIZED POSSESSIONS.
>> TWO-THIRDS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
THE RULES ARE SUSPENDED.
THE BILL IS PASSED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HELLO.
HELLO.
BANKRUPT AND ABOUT TO LOSE YOUR
HOUSE?
WHILE YOUR NEIGHBORS CONTINUE TO
LIVE IN PEACE AND FINANCIAL
SECURITY?
GOOD NEWS, WHY DON'T YOU AND
BESSIE HERE GO LIVE THERE?
UNLESS OF COURSE, THEY HAVE GUNS
DON'T WORRY YOU'LL FIND A HOUSE
THAT DOESN'T.
IF BOTH SIDES OF CONGRESSIONAL
AISLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS
SOLELY BASED ON THIS SEASON'S
POLITICAL ADS AND POLITICAL
EXPEDIENCY PERHAPS WE SHOULD RUN
THIS AD.
>> HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEWS?
>> I KNOW.
>> THE REPUBLICANS SURE ARE
(bleep) (bleep).
>> I KNOW.
BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SUCH
(bleep) PUSSIES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WHAT CAN WE DO?
>> CALL YOUR CONGRESS PERSON AND
TELL THEM THEY ARE JUST
