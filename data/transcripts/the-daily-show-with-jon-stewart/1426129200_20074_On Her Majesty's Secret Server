( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK!
THE SCANDAL OVER HILLARYCLINTON'S NONUSE OF A MANDATED
GOVERNMENT E-MAIL ACCOUNT WHILSTSECRETARY OF STATE HAS ENTERED
ITS SECOND WEEK, WHICH MEANS WEHERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" HAVE
HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE AGRAPHIC OPEN FOR SUCH SAID
SCANDAL.
♪  ♪( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  YESTERDAY, UH,FORMER PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON
HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TOEXPLAIN WHY THE RULE SAYING SHE
TO CONDUCT HER BUSINESS ON AGOVERNMENT E-MAIL ACCOUNT DID
NOT REALLY APPEAL TO HER.
>> WHEN I GOT TO WORK ASSECRETARY OF STATE, I OPTED FOR
CONVENIENCE TO USE MY PERSONALE-MAIL ACCOUNT, WHICH WAS
ALLOWED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT,BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
EASIER TO CARRY JUST ONE DEVICEFOR MY WORK AND FOR MY PERSONAL
E-MAILS INSTEAD OF TWO.
>> Jon:  TWO DEVICES IS ATOTAL HASSLE.
I MEAN, LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TOENJOY, LET'S SAY, A DELICIOUS
SUNDAE, AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE OH,NO, MY BLACKBERRY.
OH!
OH, WAIT, I'M GETTING ANOTHERCALL!
HOLD ON! JUST WAIT.
HOLD ON! I JUST DO --
OH, NO!
OH!
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND YOU GOTTA FIGURE A SITUATIONLIKE THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.
( LAUGHTER )( LAUGHTER )
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TOMOVE WITH ME.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ANSWER.
FIRST, SINCE CLINTON LEFT THESTATE DEPARTMENT, HER
SINGLE-DEVICE PREFERENCE HASCOMPLETELY GONE AWAY.
>> I HAVE A-- YOU KNOW, ANIPAD, A MINI iPAD, AN iPHONE,
AND BLACKBERRY.
>> A SIDE KICK, A VITA, A ZUNE.
NINTENDO POWER GLOVE.
( LAUGHTER )CAN WITH TWO STRINGS.
FAX MACHINE. TAMAGOTCHI.
AND A BURNER PHONE.
I JUST SNAP THAT IN HALF ANDTOSS IT IN THE CHESAPEAKE.
WOO!
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.
AND SECOND, YOU ARE A PERSONTHAT WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT,
WHICH IS A SUPERINCONVENIENT JOB.
DID YOU KNOW THAT EVERYWHERE YOUGO, YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO CARRY A
PHONE BUT A BRIEFCASE FILLEDWITH NUCLEAR CODES.
SO YOU CAN'T SUDDENLY GO,"BRIEFCASE IS KIND OF A HASSLE
TO CARRY CAN I JUST PUT THECODES ON MY PHONE BECAUSE
THEN HALFWAY THROUGH YOUR TERMYOU BUTT DIAL A NUCLEAR STRIKE
ON MEXICO.
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING, THE RULEEXISTS SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT
CAN AUTOMATICALLY ARCHIVE ALLYOUR WORK E-MAILS.
BUT SINCE YOU DID IT YOUR OWNWAY, YOUR WORK E-MAILS ARE ALL
MIXED UP WITH YOUR PERSONALE-MAILS, AND NOW THEY HAVE TO BE
SEPARATED OUT.
LET ME GUESS WHO YOU CHOSE TOHANDLE THAT DELICATE JOB.
>> WHAT I DID WAS TO DIRECT, YOUKNOW, MY COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
I AM VERY CONFIDENT OF THEPROCESS THAT WE CONDUCTED.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE'VE DONEEXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE
DONE.
>> Jon:  AND I HAVE NO DOUBTTHAT YOU HAVE NO DOUBT.
( LAUGHTER )AND MAYBE YOU DID HAND OVER
EVERYTHING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO,BUT WHEN WE ALL AGREE TO DO
THINGS A CERTAIN WAY AND YOU DOIT IN A DIFFERENT WAY, IT LOOKS
WEIRD.
IT'S LIKE WE ALL AGREED TORECYCLE-- BLUE CANS AND THE
GREEN CANS.
BUT YOU GO, GOT IT, BLUE ANDGREEN.
WE SAY IS SHE GOING TO PUT THEMIN THE CANS?
AND YOU GO NO, BUT I'LL TAKECARE OF IT.
AND THEN WE THINK, JUST PUT ITIN THE ( BLEEP ) GREEN CAN!
HOW HARD IS IT?
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
I GOT THE GLASS.
I'M DOING IT IN MY HOUSE.
IT'S OKAY.
( LAUGHTER )SO JUST FOR FUNSIES, WHY DON'T
YOU LET SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'TWORK FOR YOU LOOK THROUGH THOSE
PERSONAL E-MAILS JUST TO SEE IFYOU MISSED ANYTHING.
>> CLINTON SAID THAT AFTER SHEWENT AND ORGANIZED HER E-MAILS
DETERMINING WHICH ONES WEREOFFICIAL BUSINESS TO BE SENT
OVER TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT ANDWHICH ONES WERE PERSONAL, THAT
SHE DELETED ABOUT 30,000 E-MAILSTHAT SHE DETERMINED TO BE PURELY
PERSONAL.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) NOW?
>> I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON TOKEEP THEM.
>> Jon:  AND WELCOME BACK.
( LAUGHTER )YOU JUST TOLD US YOU DIDN'T
FOLLOW THE RULES BECAUSE HAVINGTWO SEPARATE E-MAIL ADDRESS
WOULD BE WAY TOO BIG A PAIN INTHE ASS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS A
FAR BIGGER PAIN IN THE ASS?
TRYING TO DELETE 30,000 E-MAILS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
