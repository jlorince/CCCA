(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST
TONIGHT, THE CHAIR ANDDIRECTOR OF THE HARVARD
UNIVERSITY ADVANCEDLEADERSHIP INITIATIVE
ALSO AN AUTHOR.
HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED MOVE,PUTTING AMERICA'S
INFRASTRUCTURE BACK IN THELEAD, PLEASE WELCOME
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
LET ME SAY THIS.
I'M GOING TO GO OUT A LIMBAND SAY NOT ONLY IS THIS A
GOOD BOOK, WELL, THERE WEGO.
NOT ONLY IS THIS A GOOD BOOK,THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BOOK.
IT'S NOT A SEXY TOPIC,INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A SEXY
TOPIC BUT WILDLY IMPORTANT.
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOUHAVE DOCUMENTED KEEPS
CRUMBLING.
>> IT IS SHABBY, IT'SDETERIORATING.
IT'S BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIESIN THE WORLD.
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT, BUTWORSE THAN THAT, IT HURTS
ALL OF US BECAUSE WE'RESTUCK IN TRAFFIC.
WE CAN'T GET TO WORK.
BUT THE AVERAGE AMERICANSPENDS 38 HOURS A YEAR STUCK
IN TRAFFIC UNNECESSARILY ANDTHAT'S THE AVERAGE.
>> Jon: THAT IS A WEEK.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WHY, THIS SEEMS LIKETHE TYPE OF ISSUE, IF WE
CAN'T DO THIS, WHAT CAN WEDO?
THIS IS FIXING OUR BRIDGES,OUR ROADS, OUR RAIL SYSTEM
IF WE CAN'T DO THAT.
>> WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'MSAYING.
>> THE REASON I WROTE THIS,NOT A SEXY TOPIC BUT YES, IT
TURNED OUT TO BE VERY SEXYWITH OUR LIVES EVERY DAY,
IT'S OUR FAMILIES, THEAVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY
SPENDS UP TO 20% OF THEIRHOUSEHOLD BUDGET ON
TRANSPORTATION AND OFTEN THEY'RENOT GETTING ANYWHERE
WITH IT.
SO WE REALLY HAVE TO FIX IT.
>> Jon: SO WHY CAN WE NOTFIX IT?
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG?
WE WERE THE LEADERS IN THEWORLD IN THE 40s AND 50s.
AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
>> WE WERE.
WE INVESTED THEN.
WE WERE THE TOP OF THEWORLD.
A LOT OF OUR BIG INVESTMENTSWERE IN THE 1960s, THE
HIGHWAY ACT, WE BUILT 21,000MILES OF INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.
WE SPENT $25 BILLION.
THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY BACKTHEN.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> YEAH, WE CAN'T SPEND THATNOW.
>> Jon: NOW WE ARE GETTINGOUR BUTTS KICKED
JAPAN HAS TRAINS THAT WILLTAKE YOU RIGHT TO YOUR HOUSE.
SOMETIMES KISS YOU GOODNIGHT AND TUCK YOU IN.
>> NOT ONLY THAT, THEY WILLDO IT AT 200 MILES PER HOUR
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT.
>> WHEREAS THE FASTESTAMTRAK CAN GO IS 150 MILES
PER HOUR AND THEY CAN'T DOIT FOR VERY LONG.
>> Jon: AND WE SAW WHEN THEYDO THERE ARE THESE DANGEROUS
ACCIDENTS AND PEOPLE AREKILLED.
IT'S AWFUL.
>> AND THAT'S NOT-- WHATEVERTHE PROXIMATE CAUSE WAS,
IT'S BECAUSE OF YEARS OFNEGLECT, OF INVESTMENT IN
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.
BUT THE THING IS, REPAIRSAREN'T SEXY.
MAINTENANCE ISN'T A VISION.
SOMEBODY SAYS HEY, YOU'REGOING TO PAINT YOUR HOUSE T
IS GOING TO LOOK EXACTLY THESAME, THAT DOESN'T GET
PEOPLE EXCITED.
SO WE NEED TO HAVE VISIONSOF WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND
WHETHER IT IS BULLET TRAINSLIKE JAPAN, WHETHER IT'S
JUST GETTING CARS OFF THEROAD THROUGH RIDE SHARING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THROUGH BETTER LIGHT-RAIL,THAT WOULD HELP MAKE OUR
LIVES BETTER AS WELL AS THEECONOMY.
>> Jon: BUT DO YOU THINKJUDGING FROM OUR HISTORY
THAT IT WILL TAKE A FREQUENTCATASTROPHES FOR US TO PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO THIS?
BRIDGES WILL FALL.
PEOPLE WILL DIE.
AND THEN WE'LL PUT SOMETHINGTHROUGH CONGRESS WHERE THEY
CAN LOOK AT OUR EMAILS ABOUTDRIVING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WILL DO.
>> THAT HAPPENS IN REDSTATES AS MUCH AS BLUE
STATES, SO YOU THINKEVERYBODY WOULD BE BEHIND
IT.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SENDINGMONEY TO PEOPLE'S DISTRICTS.
WHY WOULDN'T THEY?
>> WILL WITH, THE THING ISYOU CAN'T SCARE PEOPLE INTO
CHANGE.
YOU CAN'T-- .
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> YOU CAN'T-- .
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S THEONLY WAY WE WENT INTO IRAQ,
ISN'T IT.
>> AND LOOK HOW THAT WORKEDOUT FOR US.
>> Jon: MAYBE WE SHOULDSCARE PEOPLE, MAYBE THAT'S
THE TRICK.
MAYBE WE NEED TO GET MOREHYPERBOLIC AND SCARE SOME
PEOPLE.
LET THEM KNOW THE REALREALITY.
>> WELL, I THINK WHENYOU-- WELL, YES, WE SHOULD,
THAT'S WHY I WROTE A BOOK.
BUT ALSO IF YOU DON'T HAVE APOSITIVE VISION, IF YOU
DON'T BELIEVE THE CHANGE ISPOSSIBLE, YOU DON'T SAY THE
GOVERNMENT WILL JUST WASTEMY MONEY.
I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE ALLOVER THE COUNTRY WHO SAY MY
POTHOLE ISN'T FIXED.
IF WE HAVE-- SO THE OTHERTHING I TRIED TO DO IS SHOW
PEOPLE THAT WE COULD DO IT.
WE'RE AMERICA.
WE ARE THE LITTLE ENGINETHAT COULD, OR CAN, OR WILL.
BUT NOT THE LITTLE ENGINETHAT CAN'T AND WON'T.
WHICH IS WHAT WE SEEM TO BENOW.
>> Jon: BY THE WAY, THAT ISTHE LITTLE ENGINE
INFRASTRUCTURE BOOK, WORSTCHILDREN'S BOOK EVER.
JUST TERRIBLE.
DIDN'T WE HAVE THE STIMULUSTHAT PUT SOME MONEY BACK
INTO INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE,WASN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT
WAS MEANT TO REFURBISH.
>> IT WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY TWAS SHOVEL READY PROJECTS SO
THAT MEANT PRETTY MUCHFIXING POTHOLES AND SEWER
LINES.
SOME OF WHICH IS STILL GOINGON.
AND MY STREET.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT OURENERGY GRID, BROADBAND, ALL
THE THINGS THAT WOULD BRINGUS UP TO SNUFF AS A MODERN
COUNTRY.
>> WE SHOULD BE DOING IT.
BUT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THEMALL IN THE SAME BREATH.
WE TALK ABOUT HIGHWAYSEPARATE FROM RAIL.
WE NEED LIGHT-RAIL.
WE TALK ABOUT THAT SEPARATEFROM BUSES.
WE DON'T THINK ABOUT HOWWE'RE GOING TO HAVE FEWER
TRUCKS BECAUSE MORE FREIGHTSHOULD BE CARRIED BY TRAIN
SO WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ITALL TOGETHER.
AND THE BROADBAND TECHNOLOGY,ALL THOSE APPS BY WHICH YOU
CAN SUMMON A CAR OR YOU CANFIND PARKING, THOSE HAVE
TREMENDOUS PROMISE FORREDUCING CONGESTION BUT WE
DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM IN THESAME BREATH.
I TRY TO TALK ABOUT ITBETWEEN THE SAME COVER.
>> Jon: THAT IS WHY THIS ISIMPORTANT, NOT JUST GOOD AS
I SAID EARLIER, BUTIMPORTANT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW,
ROSSABETH MOSS KANTER.
