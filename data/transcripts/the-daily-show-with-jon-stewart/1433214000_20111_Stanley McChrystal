(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
MY GUEST TONIGHT, FOUR-STARGENERAL IN THE U.S. ARMY,
SERVED AS COMMANDER OF AMERICANCOALITION FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN
HIS BOOK IS CALLED "TEAM
OF TEAMS," NEW RULES OFENGAGEMENT FOR A COMPLEX WORLD.
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM,GENERAL STANLEY McCHRYSTAL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
HOW ARE YOU?
>> VERY WELL.
>> Jon: YOU'VE LEFT THE ARMYAND EVERYTHING'S GONE TO HELL.
I DON'T WANT TO DRAW ACONCLUSION TO THIS.
IF CAUSATION IS NECESSARY TOCORRELATION, BUT IT'S HARD NOT
TO DRAW THE CONCLUSION.
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL IS THE ONEHOLDING THIS THING TOGETHER,
AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, THE ENTIREMIDDLE EAST, YOU LEAVE, THE
WHOLE THING GOES UP.
TRUE OR FALSE?
>> I'D LOVE THAT TO BE TRUEBUT --
>> ALL I HEARD WAS TRUE(LAUGHTER)
LOOK AT THIS RIGHT HERE,THIS IS THE CHART OF YOU WRITE
THIS IS WHAT OUR ARMY WASDESIGNED TO FIGHT, AND THIS IS
WHAT IT'S FIGHTING.
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DESIGNEDFOR, WHAT WE WERE FACING.
SO WHY ARE WE HAVING TROUBLE?
>> EXACTLY.
AND THAT'S WHAT I.S.I.S. IS NOW.
I.S.I.S. IS A 21st CENTURYORGANIZATION THAT USES SOME
FRIGHTENING TACTICS REALLYQUICKLY AND THEN LEVERAGE
DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS TOESSENTIALLY TIE THEIR ENEMIES IN
KNOTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY IS THISALWAYS OUR PROBLEM?
IS IT BECAUSE WE CREATED IT?
(LAUGHTER)OR IS THAT --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT YOU GET MY POINT?
>> YEAH, I DO.
I MEAN, WE CREATED, ESSENTIALLY,MUCH OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS
IN THE WORLD NOW, BUT WHAT WEHAVE DONE IS, IN MANY CASE,
WE'VE HARNESSED IT TO 19th ANDEARLY 20th CENTURY
ORGANIZATIONS AND PROCESSES ANDARE UNWILLING TO LET GO OF THE
SIDE OF THE POOL TO CHANGE.
>> Jon: OUR POLICIES,  I HEARA LOT OF
PEOPLE ON TV AND EXPERTS WHOCOME ON AND SAY, WELL, IF WE HAD
ONLY LEFT IN 5,000 TROOPS OR10,000 TROOPS OR ONLY ARMED THIS
ONE MILITIA AGAINST THE OTHERMILITIA, NONE OF THIS WOULD BE
HAPPENING.
ISN'T IT THE HUBRIS --, DIDN'TWE DESTABILIZE THE REGION TO
BEGIN WITH TO A LARGE EXTENT?
>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN GIVEOURSELVES THAT MUCH CREDIT.
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT MUCHINFLUENCE TO CAUSE ALL THE
PROBLEMS THERE.
I THINK WE WERE PART OF IT.
WE'VE ALSO BEEN PART OF THESOLUTION. THE REALITY IS
THAT REGION IS SO COMPLEX, THEREIS NO SINGLE POLITICAL NARRATIVE
AND SO MANY FORCES ARE GOING INSO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
THAT DEALING WITH IT WILL TAKE ALONG-TERM AND FOCUSED APPROACH.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE INTERESTINGTHING BECAUSE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO
WHOEVER THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILLBE, THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE A VERY
CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY THIS ONETHING THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT IF
WE DID DO IT WOULD BE ALL ICECREAM AND SWEDISH FISH AND
UNICORNS.
>> YEAH, I ACTUALLY THINK THEFUTURE, WHEN YOU LOOK FOR IT, IS
COMPLEX.
THEREFORE, IT IS FUNDAMENTALLYIMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT.
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS GO WITHTHINGS WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF
HUMILITY WHICH SAYS WE'LLAPPROACH THINGS WITH REALITY,
WE'LL HAVE TO ADAPT CONSTANTLYAND REITERATE.
YOU WON'T COME UP WITH A100-YEAR PLAN, A 50 OR EVEN A
5-YEAR PLAN, YOU HAVE TO COME UPWITH GENERAL DIRECTION AND
FRAMEWORKS AND LEARN EVERYDAY, THAT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE
IN NOW.>> IT APPEARS TO ME THAT
>> THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR OFTHE '80s, WE'RE FUNDING
SADDAM, GIVING HIM ARMS.
NOW, THE PEOPLE WHO LEARNEDTHEIR LESSONS OF WAR WITH SADDAM
ARE LEADING I.S.I.S.
THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROL FROMSADDAM'S GENERALS.
WE ARE IN MANY WAYS ON THE SIDEOF IRAN FIGHTING THESE GUYS.
LOOKS LIKE WE JUST SHIFTED THEIRAN-IRAQ WAR 50 MILES NORTHEAST
AND SWITCHED SIDES.
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> THAT MIGHT BE OVERALLLYSIMPLISTIC.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: OKAY.
THANK YOU!
BUT IS THAT PART OF -- BECAUSEWE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, EACH
TIME WE INTERVENE, DON'T WE JUSTSUCK OURSELVES FURTHER AND
FURTHER INTO THE QUICK SAND?
>> YEAH, WHENEVER YOU INTERVENEIN SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS THAT
REGION AND PARTICULARLY INTODAY'S ENVIRONMENT WHERE
INFORMATION PASSES SO FAST, YOUCAN'T PREDICT EXACTLY WHAT THE
OUTCOME WILL BE.
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DOIS, ONE, STUDY HISTORY SO WE
UNDERSTAND THE FORCES THAT ARETHERE AND THEN GO FORWARD VERY
CAREFULLY.
WE WON'T RESHAPE THAT REGION.
WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER EVEN IFWE WANTED TO.
WHAT WE AREN'T GOING TO DOEITHER IS WE AREN'T GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DISENGAGE ENTIRELYBECAUSE IT'S GOING TO MATTER TO
US EVERYWHERE AND THE REST OFTHE WORLD.
>> Jon: THE BOOK IS BASICALLYTHAT IDEA OF BOY YOU THINK YOU
HAVE A PLAN BUT YOU NEED TO BEMORE AGILE BECAUSE THINGS ARE
WAY MORE COMPLEX AND YOU'RETRYING TO APPLY THIS INTO OTHER
AREAS BEYOND JUST WAR.
>> EXACTLY.
IN THE MILITARY, THERE'S THESAYING THAT NO PLAN SURVIVES
CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'REFINDING IN BUSINESS NOW, TOO.
YOU'VE GOT OPPOSITION FROMCOMPETITORS, GARAGE STARTUPS,
NEW TECHNOLOGY, ALL OF THESETHINGS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT
GET VERY HAPPY WITH BEINGEFFICIENT, VERY, VERY WIRED
PROCESSES THAT HAVE WORKED FORTHEIR GRANDFATHERS, FATHERS AND
BROTHERS NOW DON'T WORK AND IT'SDISORIENTING THE PEOPLE.
SO THE REALITY IS BECAUSE YOUCAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE, I
THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TOWALK IN BEING ADAPTABLE AND GEAR
OURSELVES AND OUR ORGANIZATIONSTHAT WAY.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK IS AMORE OPENMINDED PLACE,
GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY,OR MILITARY?
WHERE WOULD YOU SAY THE GREATESTLEARNING CURVE IS, THE MOST
AGILITY EXISTS AND WHO HAS THEMOST ROOM TO GROW AND
LEARN THOSE LESSONS.
>> THEY ALL HAVE A LONG WAY TOGO BUT WHAT I SEE IN BUSINESS IS
THERE'S A DAILY STRUGGLE TO STAYIN BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE MONEY, WHATNOT.
SO THERE TENDS TO BEADAPTABILITY.
THAT'S NOT TRUE IN EVERYBUSINESS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN A
A LOT OF BIG NAMES FALL BECAUSETHEY HAVEN'T CHANGED.
THE MILITARY TRADITIONALLY ONLYFOUGHT A GENERATION OR TO AND
THERE WOULD BE PERIODS OF PEACEWHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT THE LAST WAR.
DURING COMBAT YOU TEND TO LEARNQUICKLY.
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SLOW TOLEARN.
>> Jon: THE MOST ADAPTABLEINDUSTRY, SECOND MOST MILITARY,
AND REALLY HASN'T YET PULLED ITSHEAD FROM THE NETHERWORLD WOULD
BE GOVERNMENT BRINGING UP THEREAR.
>> PROBABLY ROOM FORIMPROVEMENT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I CAN TELL.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE IN THEPOSITION YOU'RE IN AND I'M IN
THE POSITION I'M IN.
"TEAM OF TEAMS," ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW, GENERAL STANLEY
McCHRYSTAL.
THANK YOU.
