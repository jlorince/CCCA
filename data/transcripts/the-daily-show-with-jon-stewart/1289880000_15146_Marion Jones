>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE WON FIVE
OLYMPIC MEDALS AT THE SYDNEY
AUSTRALIA GAMES IN 2000 AND
2007.
SHE WAS STRIPPED OF THOSE MEDALS
AND SHE CHRONICLES THE
EXPERIENCE IN HER NEW BOOK "ON
THE RIGHT TRACK: FINDING
FORGIVENESS AND THE STRENGTH TO
OVERCOME AND SUCCEED."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
MARION JONES.
( APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M DOING GOOD.
THANK YOU.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS SOME STORY.
THIS IS "ON THE RIGHT TRACK."
YOU WERE THE FASTEST WOMAN IN
THE WORLD.
YOU WON ALL THESE GOLD MEDALS.
AT THE TIME YOU WERE DOING IT,
DID YOU... WERE YOU
RATIONALIZING WHAT WAS GOING ON?
LIKE IN YOUR HEAD, HOW WERE YOU
MOVING YOURSELF PAST THE FACT
THAT YOU WERE USING THESE... WAS
IT PURELY STEROIDS?
>> PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS.
WELL, AT THAT TIME AROUND THE
2000 GAMES, BEFORE THE 2000
GAMES I WAS GIVEN THESE
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS,
AND, YOU KNOW, I TRAINED AND
TRAINED AND WON THESE MEDALS AND
FOUND OUT IN 2003 THAT INDEED
ALL ALONG THAT'S WHAT I HAD BEEN
GIVEN, AND SO IN 2007 I GAVE
THEM ALL BACK.
>> Jon: IN YOUR MIND, I DIDN'T
REALIZE THIS, THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU KNEW ABOUT.
>> THAT'S CORRECT, THAT'S
CORRECT.
>> Jon: THIS CHANGES THINGS IN
SOMEWHAT OF A LARGER CONTEXT
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU END UP
THEN...
>> WELL, IN 2003 THERE WAS THIS
BALCO SCANDAL AND I WAS ASKED BY
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS TO COME
AND ANSWER WHATEVER QUESTIONS I
MIGHT KNOW ABOUT IT.
WHEN I WAS SHOWN THIS
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG, AT
FIRST I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT.
AND THEN AFTER A FEW MOMENTS I
RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS WHAT I
HAD BEEN GIVEN.
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, I MADE A
DECISION TO LIE ABOUT IT.
I LIED ABOUT THE USE OF
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS.
OF COURSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
TO LIE THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS.
>> Jon: FOR ME THAT'S THE PART
TO IMAGINE.
I IMAGINE THESE ATHLETES AT THE
LEVEL YOU'RE AT, YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING YOU'RE PUTTING IN
YOUR BODY.
ARE YOU GETTING VILES OF STUFF
AND YOU'RE LIKE, I LIKE THE
CLEAR STUFF?
>> NO, NO.
>> Jon: HOW DOES IT WORK?
>> WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN I
TELL THEM THIS, THEY'RE LIKE I
DON'T BELIEVE YOU, BUT I LIKE TO
TELL PEOPLE THAT ELITE ATHLETES,
YOU TRUST YOUR INNER CIRCLE.
YOU TRUST YOUR COACHES AND THE
PEOPLE AROUND YOU.
I TRUSTED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
AROUND ME AND I DIDN'T ASK
QUESTIONS.
AND THAT WAS MY FAULT, YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS.
I KNEW I HAD WORKED HARD.
I KNEW I WAS BLESSED WITH AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TALENT AND I
JUST TRUSTED PEOPLE TO THE POINT
THAT IT COST ME MY FREEDOM, YOU
KNOW, IN 2007 I PLEAD GUILTY.
I SERVED SIX MONTHS IN PRISON.
I LOST EVERYTHING.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE INNER CIRCLE.
DID THEY GO TO PRISON?
>> NO.
>> Jon: WHY NOT THE CIRCLE?
IT SEEMS LIKE THE CIRCLE SHOULD
GO TO PRISON?
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PRISON THING
SHOULD GO IN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES.
THE OUTER CIRCLE GOES PRISON
FIRST, AND THEN THE INNER CIRCLE
AND THEN FINALLY YOU GET TO THE
DOT IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU GO,
YOU HAVE TO GO NOW.
WHY DON'T THEY HAVE TO GO TO
PRISON?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MY OWN
CASE.
YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH YOU.
I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE
ACCOUNTABILITY.
>> Jon: WERE THEY BROUGHT UP
ON CHARGES AT LEAST?
>> ONE OF THEM I THINK WAS
BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES, AND I
THINK THE CASE WAS DISMISSED OR
SOMETHING OF THAT, BUT I MEAN,
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH.
I MADE THE MISTAKE, SO I HAD TO
PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOUR... DID
ANY OF YOUR TEAMMATES ALSO
SUFFER?
RELAY TEAMMATES ALSO SUFFERED.
SO THEY GET TO KEEP THEIR
MEDALS?
>> NO.
THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE HARDEST
PARTS.
I APOLOGIZED ON THE COURTROOM
STEPS.
I APOLOGIZED TO ALL MY FANS AND
EVERYBODY AROUND THE WORLD.
IT'S SOMETHING I MENTIONED IN
THE BOOK.
IT'S HARD TO FIND THAT
FORGIVENESS.
EVERY DAY I WAKE UP KNOWING I
HURT SO MANY PEOPLE, BUT IT'S
ALSO WHY I WROTE THE BOOK
BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE
THERE'S A WAY TO GET OUT OF ALL
THAT AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS
IN YOUR LIFE.
AND I'VE TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
IN A TWO AND A HALF YEAR SPAN.
I'M SO PROUD TO BE A MOTHER OF
THREE.
I'VE MADE THE WNBA AND I'M
HELPING PEOPLE MAKE BETTER
DECISIONS IN YOUR OWN LIVES.
>> Jon: HAVE YOUR TEAMMATES
CONTACTED YOU.
HAVE THEY SAID, I GET IT?
THEY'RE PROBABLY, IF WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS TRUE, THEY UNDERSTAND
THE INNER SICKLE, TAKE WHAT YOU
TAKE THING, I WOULD THINK, OR
ARE THEY STILL...
>> NONE OF THEM HAVE REACHED OUT
THE ME.
I APOLOGIZED TO EVERYBODY AND...
>> Jon: THE PRISON THING IS
CRAZY.
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH IN PRISON,
EVEN IF YOU TOOK IT PURPOSEFULLY
AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT AND THEN
SHOT AN OLD MAN IN THE FACE,
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH IN PRISON
IS ASTONISHING.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT WAS
A SLAP ON THE WRIST.
AND I TELL THEM THAT IT
ABSOLUTELY WASN'T.
I SPENT MORE THAN 45 DAYS IN
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR LYING
TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS.
AND I WAS AWAY FROM MY FAMILY.
>> Jon: YOU WERE IN SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT BECAUSE... ONE OF
YOUR BUNK MATES...
>> ATTACKED ME.
>> Jon: ONE OF YOUR CABIN
MATES ATTACKED YOU OVER A
LAUNDRY SITUATION.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
IN PRISON YOU DON'T KNOW, SO LET
ME SHARE WITH YOU...
>> Jon: DON'T I?
( LAUGHTER )
>> YOU DO CERTAIN FAVORS IN
PRISON FOR EACH OTHER, AND WE
DON'T DEAL WITH MONEY, SO WE
HAVE MONEY ON OUR COMMISSARY.
SO I HAD A ROOMMATE HELPING ME
WITH MILAN DRIMENT SHE DIDN'T
LIKE THAT I DIDN'T WANT HER TO
DO MILAN DRI ANYMORE.
SO SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT.
SHE ATTACKED ME.
I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF.
SO BECAUSE OF THEY WAS IN
SOLITARY FOR 45-PLUS DAYS.
>> IF YOU WERE TO SAY TO HER,
USE YOUR WORDS, NO?
>> THAT WASN'T GOING DOWN MANY
PRISON.
>> Jon: IT REALLY DOES FOR
WHATEVER PEOPLE FIND FAULT WITH
OR WHAT THEY THINK YOU DID OR
DIDN'T DO, THIS DOES MAKE YOU
WANT TO READJUST THE PENAL
SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND
FIGURE OUT HOW SOMEONE IN THAT
SITUATION WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY
GOING ON FINANCIALLY AND
OTHERWISE HOW THOSE PEOPLE AVOID
ANY CULPABILITY.
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU
NEVER KNOW WHERE LIFE IS GOING
TO TAKE YOU.
TEN YEARS AGO I NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT I WOULD BE A ADVOCATE
FOR PRISON REFORM BECAUSE I
DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY IN PRISON,
AND YOU REALIZE THAT YOU NEVER
KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE YOUR
NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.
IF YOU DON'T EQUIP THE PEOPLE IN
PRISON WITH THE RESOURCES TO GET
AN EDUCATION SO THAT WHEN THEY
GET OUT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL,
THEY'RE GOING TO WIND UP RIGHT
BACK IN PRISON OR WIND UP BEING
YOUR NEIGHBOR OR WORSE MAYBE
MARRYING YOUR DAUGHTER OR YOUR
SON.
>> Jon: WHAT THE BLIEP BLEEP?
WHAT?
( LAUGHTER )
ANYWAY, YOU GOT TO CHECK THIS
OUT.
"ON THE RIGHT TRACK," IT'S ON
THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
AND IT'S A BOLD THING YOU'RE
DOING.
