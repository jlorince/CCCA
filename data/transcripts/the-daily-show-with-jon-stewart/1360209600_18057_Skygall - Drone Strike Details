ADMISSIONS PROCESS.
DO WE AT LEAST YELL FORE!
HEADS UP!
THIS IS FREAKING ME OUT A LITTLE BIT.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF THE MEMOS AND I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION WILL SHOW THE
PRESENT DOCUMENTS TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE THEIR RECORDS ON SUCH TOUCHY WAR ON TERROR GLOBAL
DISCLOSURES TO GO BY.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS RELEASED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MEMOS THAT AUTHORIZED THE C.I.A.
TO USE HARSH INTERROGATION METHODS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA PERSONAL LAY PROVED RELEASING THE MEMOS IN SUCH DETAIL.
>> Jon: PERSONALLY.
HE INVITED EVERYONE TO THE MEMO RELEASE PARTISM IT'S AN INVITATION.
ALTHOUGH, IRONICALLY, GUEST LIST WAS CLASSIFIED.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW LISTEN:  WE KNOW HOW THIS ADMINISTRATION FEELS ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITHHOLDING
MEMOS FROM CONGRESS BECAUSE OF THE 2004 ON THE TORTUREOS.
>> WILL BE PROVIDE -- TORTURE MEMOS.
>> WILL YOU PROVIDE THESE TO THE COMMITTEE?
>> NO I WILL NOT.
>> YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION NOT TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS AND THAT AIN'T CONSTITUTIONAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: BY THE WAY THAT'S THE NAME OF HIS ONE-MAN OFF BROADWAY SHOW.
AIN'T CONSTITUTIONAL.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TAGGED IT WITH THAT AIN'T CONSTITUTIONAL MOTHER (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE OBAMA BIDEN WHITE HOUSE WILL RELEASE
THE MEMOS DETAILING IN SPECIFICS OUR DRONE STRIKES POLICY.
>> WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASE THE MEMOS?
>> I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU ON ALLEGED MEMOS REGARDING POE TEN SALLY CLASSIFIED MATTERS.
WITHOUT GOING INTO THE ALLEGED EXISTENCE OF ANY PARTICULAR MEMO OR ACTION I CAN SAY THAT WHAT WE
CAN NOT DO IS DISCUSS CLASSIFIED OPERATIONS.
>> Jon: ALLEGED MEMOS DID YOU JUST GO JEDI MIND TRICK ON US?
THESE ARE NOT THE DRONES YOU ARE LOOK FOR.
TELL YOU SOMETHING CARNEY, YOU ARE GOOD BUT YOU ARE NO SITH LORD.
YES, MASTER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORSE, THE ALARMINGLY AMBIGUOUS GUIDELINES FOR THE STRIKE PROGRAM OR THE
FACT THAWR SAYING WE MIGHT NOT HAVE WRITTEN THESE DOWN IN MEMO FORM.
SURELY THERE ARE MEMOS ON THIS.
>> THERE ARE LEGAL MEMOS WRITTEN BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON THIS KILLING JUST AS THERE WERE
LEGAL MEMOS UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE USE OF TORTURE.
>> Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT.
THOUGH OBVIOUSLY THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SECRET WAR POLICY
IN THAT I ASSUME THE DEMOCRATS HAVE WRITTEN THEM ON RECYCLED PAPER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW THEY ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTALISTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT WERE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S REASONS FOR LETTING THE BUSH TORTURE MEMOS OUT?
>> THE TRUTH IS THAT BECAUSE THESE WERE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
>> Jon: OKAY TO MAKE MATERIAL PUBLIC WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT AND WE'RE COVERED THERE
BECAUSE THE NORKTS RELEASED THIS MEMO ON DRONE STRIKES.
WE'RE GOOD.
RELEASE THEM.
WHAT SNELS.
>> EVEN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION HAS REVEALED THE MOST SERIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS.
>> Jon: PRECEDENT NUMBER TWO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FESSED UP TO DOING IT AND OBAMA HAS DONE
EVERYTHING SHORT OF TAKING OUT A BILLBOARD ABOUT THE DRONE PROGRAMS.
I THINK WE ARE OKAY THERE, TOO.
I THINK WE'RE DOING PRETTY G.
AND WHAT IS THE LAST REASON?
>> THERE WAS NO LEGAL RATIONAL FOR KEEPING THEM CLASSIFIED.
>> Jon: OH.
SO WE DON'T HE MIND YOU KNOWING ABOUT (bleep) WE DON'T DO ONCE WE DON'T DO IT NIX WE TOLD YOU
WE WOULD BE TRANSPARENT WE JUST DIDN'T TELL
