ALLOW ME TO GET PERSONAL FOR JUST A MOMENT.
AS A FATHER OF MIXED-FAITH CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CHRISTIAN AND JEWISH
HOLIDAYS, I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT WE JEWS ARE GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED OUT HERE.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT, JEWS?
CAMERA 3.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE'VE ALREADY CONCEDED DEFEAT IN THE CHRISTMAS VERSUS HANUKKAH KURFUFFLE, SEEING
THAT THE RISIANS ARE CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF THEIR SAVIOR AND HANUKKAH IS
ACKNOWLEDGING OIL LASTING LONGER THAN IT WOULD NORMALLY LAST.
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
TRUTH BE TOLD, THERE IS REALLY NO GAUGE.
HOW MUCH OIL WAS IN THERE?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT DAYS WORTH OF OIL.
IT COULD HAVE A VERY REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OIL.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE POINT IS THIS.
THERE'S NO CONTEST THERE.
HANUKKAH, CHRISTMAS.
NO CONTEST.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THIS ONE TOO.
THE KEY IS THE CHILDREN,
PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT CRISTIANS HAVE FIGURED OUT.
YOU GET THE CHILDREN, YOU WIN.
LET'S CHECK OUT BOTH SIDES' HOLIDAY PITCH.
KIDS, EASTER WEEKEND IS AN OBSERVATION OF CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION.
SO, BOOM!
A BASKET WITH CANDY.
WE HAVE CHOCOLATE BUNNIES.
WE GOT CANDY EGGS.
WE GOT CHOCOLATE BUNNIES AND CANDY EGGS.
HOW ARE CHRISTIANS THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH PLASTIC GRASS BY THE WAY?
WE'RE THE ONES WITH HAY FEVER.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S COOL.
IT'S COOL.
JEWS, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR FREEDOM FROM SLAVERY.
SO, BOOM!
LET MY PEOPLE NOD.
WE COULD HAVE GONE WITH A FREEDOM THEME FESTIVAL.
INSTEAD WE CHOSE TO FOCUS ON THE SLAVERY PART OF THE DINNER.
HEY, FIVE-YEAR-OLDS, BASKET FILLED WITH CANDY AND JELLY BEANS OR HORSE RADISH STILL IN ROOT FORM?
WOULD YOU LIKE THE TREATS OF MAGICAL BUNNY BROUGHT YOU OR A BONE FROM A DEAD BABY LAMB?
DON'T WORRY.
WE USED ITS BLOOD TO MARK THE DOOR.
WHICH EGG AM I GOING TO GO FOR,
THE ONE FILLED WITH CHOCOLATE OR THE ONE FILLED WITH EGG?
BECAUSE IT'S AN ACTUAL (BEEP) EGG.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SLAVES ATE.
TASTE IT.
OH, WAIT.
BEFORE YOU EAT IT, MAKE SURE YOU DIP IT IN SALT WATER.
IT REPRESENTS THE TEARS OF YOUR ANCESTORS.
OH, GOOD.
I SEE YOU'RE MAKING MORE.
WE GOT TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH.
THEY'RE CRUSHING US.
I'M NOT SAYING WE LOSE OUR TRADITIONS.
WE HAVE TO ADAPT IT WITH A SLIGHT NOD TOWARDS RECRUITMENT.
I'M NOT SAYING WE HAVE TO GO JEHOVAH'S WITNESS ON THIS THING.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BRINGING A LITTLE JAZZ?
WE HAVE A GREAT STORY HERE.
MOSES PARTING THE RED SEA.
HOW HAVE WE NOT TURNED THAT INTO A WATER PARK?
WAIT.
I'LL SEE YOU OVER AT THE RED SEA RIDE WHEN I'M DONE BUILDING ICE CREAM PYRAMIDS.
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
DID YOU SEE IN THE CRISTIANS BOOK THIS YEAR WHO THEIR SPECIAL GUESTS ARE.
>> ON THIS EASTER SUNDAY A FAMILIAR FACE HELPING TO DELIVER THE SUNDAY SERMON.
QUARTERBACK TIM TEBOW.
>> Jon: THEY'VE GOT TEBOW.
TIM TEBOW, SUPER STAR NFL QUARTERBACK HELPING THEM CELEBRATE EASTER.
HE'S DRAWING LIKE 20,000 PEOPLE.
WHO DO WE HAVE?
THE SAME GUEST EVERY YEAR,
ELIJAH.
HE CAN'T EVEN BE FOUND.
OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE ALSO COULD GET A SUPER STAR JEWISH QUARTERBACK TO DELIVER
THE PASSOVER STORY BUT MY GUESS IS A SUPER STAR JEWISH QUARTERBACK IS AROUND THE SAME
LIKELIHOOD AS ELIJAH SHOWING UP.
LET'S AT LEAST COMPETE WITH THE MAKE BELIEVE EASTER BUNNY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU PASSOVER PETE, THE GUITAR- PLAYING PIZZA EATING LION.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S UP, PETE?
HEY, KIDS, HEY, KIDS, HAVE YOUR PASSOVER PIZZA.
NOW I KNOW TECHNICALLY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT PIZZA DURING PASSOVER.
TECHNICALLY LIONS DON'T PLAY GUITARS AND QUITE FRANKLY BUNNIES DON'T DELIVER EGGS.
LET'S JUST SAY THAT WHEN THE KIDS TURN 13 WE'LL TELL THEM THE REAL STORY.
SO, JEWS, WE'VE GOT TO STEP IT UP A BIT.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'LL BE PLAYING THE LATEST TITLE IN MY HOT NEW JEWISH VIDEO GAME
PASSOVER LINE, RED SEA REDEMPTION, THE WANDERING.
IT'S A FIRST-PERSON EXODUSER,
WHERE KIDS CAN EXPERIENCE ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING LOST IN THE DESERT FOR 40 YEARS.
>> ASK FOR DIRECTIONS.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING AGAIN?
>> Jon: ONLY 38 MORE YEARS TO GO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
