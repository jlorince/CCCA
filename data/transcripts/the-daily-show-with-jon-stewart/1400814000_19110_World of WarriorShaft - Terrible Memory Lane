BUT LET'S BE CLEAR --AS TRADITIONS GO, MISTREATING
OUR VETERANS IS A FULLYBIPARTISAN ENDEAVOR.
AS WE'LL SOON FIND OUT AS WETAKE A JAUNT DOWN
"TERRIBLE MEMORY LANE."
WHAT'S UP, MAN!
WHAT'S UP?
THE 1980s!
GIRLS JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN!
AND REAGAN JUST WANTED TO HAVEGORBACHEV TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!
WHILE MEANWHILE THE V.A. WASTELLING THEIR RESEARCHERS TO
UNDERREPORT THE NUMBER OF V.A.
HOSPITALS WITH AN INORDINATELYHIGH MORTALITY RATE.
AND AMERICA FELL IN LOVE WITH AFAMILY CALLED THE SIMPSONS.
NOT FAR ENOUGH BACK?
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
IN THE 1960'S,
THE BEATLES EXPERIMENTED WITH"THE WHITE ALBUM,"
WHILE IN VIETNAM THE MILITARYWAS EXPERIMENTING WITH A
"DIFFERENT" COLOR.
AGENT "ORANGE."
DON'T WORRY, TROOPS, THIS GROOVYHERBICIDE WON'T CAUSE YOU ANY
HARM.
UNLESS YOU CONSIDER CANCER ANDNERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE HARM.
WHOAH,
I JUST HAD A VISION, THAT 20YEARS FROM NOW
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION ISGONNA DENY FEDERAL LIABILITY IN
AGENT ORANGE CONTAMINATION, ANDSUPPRESS EVIDENCE OF HARM TO
VIETNAM VETERANS.A SITUATION THAT WON'T BE
RECTIFIED FOR ANOTHER 20YEARS AFTER THAT
-- MAN!
NOT FAR ENOUGH?
ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT THIS?
THE YEAR WAS 1932!
AND WHILE MOST OF AMERICA WASBEING SERVED DELICIOUS SOUP,
10,000 WORLD WAR I VETERANSMARCHED ON WASHINGTON TO GET
THE WAR BONUSES THEY'D BEENPROMISED 15 YEARS AGO
SAID THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,"WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT BONUS
IN THE FORM OF TEAR GASAND AN ESCORT OF TANKS?"
>> CONGRESSMEN LEFT THROUGH BACKDOORS AND UNDERGROUND TUNNELS TO
AVOID CONFRONTATIONS.
>> I KNOW WHO'S MADE THISCOUNTRY WORTH LIVING IN.
IT'S JUST YOU FELLAS.
LOOK, IT MAKES ME SO DAMNMAD, A WHOLE LOTTA PEOPLE
SPEAK OF YOU AS TRAMPS, BY  GODTHEY DIDN'T SPEAK OF YOU AS
TRAMPS IN 1917 AND 18, NO!"(CHEERS)]
>> I'M WITH YOU, RETIRED GENERALBUTLER
IT MAKES ME SO STEAMED, WHY I'VEGOT A SWEAR JAR RIGHT HERE THAT,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON THERE! HOLD ON.
DON'T DO IT YET! HERE WE GO.
(BLEEP) (BLEEP) (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY, OH, BY THE WAY,LET'S LOSE ALL THIS.
I WISH BREAKING PROMISESTO VETERANS WAS A
20th CENTURY INNOVATION, BUTSINCE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WALK
THROUGH ALL THE WAYSTHEY GOT SCREWED IN
THE 19th CENTURY, LET'S JUSTJUMP BACK TO THE FIRST WAR.
THE NUMBER ONE, THE NUMBERONE SONG WAS -- THAT ONE WITH
THE FLUTE, AND EVERYONE IN THECOUNTRY WAS WATCHING THAT HIT
SHOW -- GOING TO SLEEP BECAUSETHE SUN WENT DOWN.
BUT A LACK OF A CONSTITUTIONDIDN'T MEAN WE THE PEOPLE
COULDN'T STILL SCREW THE THEVETERANS. WHICH IS WHY
IN 1783, A FEW DISGRUNTLEDFORMER REVOLUTIONARY FIGHTERS
TOOK CONGRESS HOSTAGETO TRY TO GET THE MONEY
THEY WERE PROMISED. THEY WERESENTENCED TO DEATH.
WORRY NOT, THE SENTENCES WERECOMMUTED!
BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR VETERANS.
SO, LET'S PRETEND THAT THISCURRENT V.A.
CRISIS IS AN ANOMALY CREATED BYONE UNUSUALLY CALLOUS AND
INEFFECTIVE PRESIDENT.
BUT THAT WOULD BE JUST PRETEND.
OR ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKENDEVE WE CAN FINALLY ADMIT
THAT AMERICA HAS HAD FOR OVER200 YEARS A GREAT BIPARTISAN
TRADITION OF HONORING THOSE WHOHAVE FOUGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM
BY (BLEEP) THEM OVER ONCETHEY GIVE THEIR GUNS BACK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
