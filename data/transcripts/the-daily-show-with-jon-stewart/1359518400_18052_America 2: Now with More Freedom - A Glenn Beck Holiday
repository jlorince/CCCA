JESUS BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO THERE -- UM -- ANYWAY.
SO WAIT, WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE WILL HAPPEN IN THE TOWN THAT YOU BUILT TO GET AWAY FROM THE NANNY STATE?
>> WE WANT TO MAKE REAL MOVIES AND REAL TELEVISION WITH ONE THAT DOESN'T CONSTANTLY ASSAULT
THE THINGS THAT WE ALL STAND FOR, REDESIGN OUR RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
TAKE THE CONCRETE OUT OF THE STREET AND REPLACE THAT WITH GRASS.
THERE'S NO REAL STREETS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES.
IT'S A PARK A WAY TO INTERACT WITH NEIGHBORS, NOT BURY OURSELVES IN THE BACKYARD.
>> Jon: EVERYONE GETS A YARD FOR COMMUNITY KICKBALL GAMES!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WOULD BE A CAPTAIN!
HOLY SHISA!
ALL THAT IS LEFT IS A PLAN TO BREAK DOWN CLASS BEARERS AND YOU HAVE A PERFECT MARXIST UTOPIA GOING.
>> WE CAN FIRST OF ALL BREAK THE CLASS BARRIERS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
SORRY.
OKAY.
SO ACTUALLY THE COMMUNAL FRONT YARD WOULD BE FUN.
FOURTH OF JULY BLOCK PARTIES EVERYBODY HANGING OUT, HOTTING DOGS, LISTENING TO SPRINGSTEEN,
DRINKING BEERth WE PLAN ON REDESIGNING THE JULY 4th HOLIDAY TO GET AWAY FROM HOTDOGS, BORN IN THE U.S.A. AND
FIREWORKS AND BEER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: YOU ARE TOUGH, YOU ARE TOUGH DUDE.
YOU JUST TAKE AWAY MY HOT DOGS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU CAN TAKE WAY MY HOT DOGS.
YOU CAN TAKE AWAY MY FIREWORKS AND MY BEER BUT YOU WILL NEVER TAKE MY SPRINGSTEEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW GLENN BECK IS NEVER GOING TO BUILD BECK OPOLIS OR BECK TOPIA OR BEKAA DO YOU
KNOW OR.
>> BECKY, BECKY --
>> Jon: BUT HIS VISION FOR THIS TOWN TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE FREEDOM FETISHES WHO SWEAR
AT EVERY TURN THAT THE OPPONENTS WHO WANT TO GOVERN DEMOCRATICALLY ARE TYRANNICAL
ASSAULT ASSAULTS IN OUR FREEDOM.
THEY DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN FREEDOM TO, THEY BELIEVE IN FREEDOM FROM LIBERALS, PEOPLE
THEY DISAGREE WITH, FROM THE SENSIBLY PRICED CLOTHING OF ANN TAYE ALREADY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THESE FOLKS CLOAK THEMSELVES UNTIL PATRIOTISM PRETENDING THEY CAN REVEAL THE TRUE INTEND OF
OUR CONSTITUTION THEY ARE JUST ANOTHER (bleep) NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION WHOSE NOSTALGIC
UTOPIA WILL FALL PART THE MINUTE SOMEBODY DECIDES TO PAINT THEIR HOUSE MAUVE.
IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE IN THE BACKYARD, EATING HOT DOGS DRINKING BEER AND BLASTING THIS.
