( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT!
ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, IBELIEVE WE HAVE FOX NEWS' DANA
PERINO IS GOING TO BE JOINING USLATER.
THAT'S VERY EXCITING.
BUT FIRST, WE GO TO ATLANTA, AMAJOR TEACHING SCANDAL THAT
LUCKILY FOR ONCE DOES NOTINVOLVE ANY WEIRD UNDERAGE
SEX-TYPE STUFF.
>> NEARLY A DOZEN FORMEREDUCATORS WERE CONVICT OF
RACKETEERING AND OTHER CHARGESFOR THEIR PART IN ONE OF THE
NATION'S BIGGESTCHEATING SCANDALS.
>> INFLATING THE TEST SCORES OFSOME OF THEIR MOST VULNERABLE
STUDENTS TO PROTECT THEIR OWNJOBS AND THEIR PAYCHECKS.
>> THEY WERE GOING BACK ANDCORRECTING THE WRONG ANSWERS.
>> IT'S, LIKE, THE SICKEST THINGTHAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO THIS
TOWN.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  YOU'RE-- YOU KNOW,
YOU LIVE IN ATLANTA.
( LAUGHTER )SO I GUESS, YOU KNOW, EXCLUDING
SLAVERY AND YOUR CITY BEINGBURNED TO THE GROUND, AND
SEGREGATION AND NOTORIOUS SERIALKILLER AND THE OLYMPIC BOMBING.
( LAUGHTER )AND CNN.
( LAUGHTER )BUT, YOU KNOW, STILL. SICK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )SICK. SICK. SICK.
CLEARLY, WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS AWIDESPREAD CHEATING SCANDAL,
FRAUD.
BY WHY DO THE PARTICULARS OFTHIS GRADE INFLATION SCANDAL
SOUND SO FAMILIAR TO ME?
>> THE COMPANIES REPEATEDLY GAVEA.A.A. RATINGS TO INVESTMENTS
THEY KNEW INCLUDED RISKYSUBPRIME LOANS.
>> Jon:  I JUST CANNOT PLACEWHERE I HAVE EXTENSIVELY HEARD
ABOUT SYSTEMIC, JUST FLAT-OUTFALSIFYING OF INFORMATION AND
CHEATING.
>> LOAN OFFICERS WOULD FALSIFYCUSTOMERS' JOB OR FINANCIAL
INFORMATION SO THEY COULDQUALIFY FOR MORTGAGES.
>> THE PATTERN OF INFLATEDAPPRAISALS AND EMPLOYEES
COACHING BORROWERS TO LIE.
>> Jon:  IT WILL COME TOME...
( LAUGHTER )I CAN'T FIGURE OUT... WHERE,
PINK FLOYD'S "THE WALL."
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT HAS TODO --
MERYL STREEP?
MINUS A "P."
PLUS A CUP OF TEA.
I DON'T -- WALL STREET-- WALLSTREET!
OH!
IT'S WALL STREET!
SON OF A BITCH!
ARE THERE ANALOGOUS REFERENCEPOINTS BETWEEN THE ATLANTA
CHEATING SCANDAL AND THEWALL STREET MELTDOWN?
HMMM.
TELL ME AGAIN, WHAT WAS THEACTUAL FRAUD COMMITTED IN EACH?
>> EDUCATORS GAVE STUDENTANSWERS.
>> COOK COUNTRYWIDE LOAN OFFICERTOLD HER TO CLAIM SHE MADE MORE
THAN TWICE HER ACTUAL INCOME.
>> Jon:  SO, BOTH FALSIFIEDINFORMATION.
>> TEST ANSWER SHEETS WEREALTERED, FABRICATED AND FALSELY
CERTIFIED.
>> I SAW PEOPLE ALTER W2s ANDALTER PAYSTUBS TO MAKE IT APPEAR
AS IF PEOPLE MADE MORE MONEY TOQUALIFY FOR A LOAN.
>> Jon: MOTHER ( BLEEP ).
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
AN ELABORATE PURPOSEFUL SYSTEMICCULTURE OF FALSIFIED
INFORMATION.
SO, ALL RIGHT, LACK OF ETHICALLIMITS, COACHED ANSWERS,
ALTERED DOCUMENTS.
SOUNDS LIKE PRETTY SIMILARBEHAVIOR.
BUT WHY DID SCHOOLS ANDFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TAKE
THESE SHORTCUTS?
>> ATLANTA EDUCATORS COULDRECEIVE BONUSES WHEN STUDENT
PERFORMANCE IMPROVES.
>> LOAN OFFICERS RECEIVEDBONUSES, COMMISSIONS.
>> Jon:  PERSONALENRICHMENT, INCENTIVIZE FOR
PERSONAL ENRICHMENT.
AND WHY WAS THIS CULTURE OFFRAUD NOT STOPPED?
>> EDUCATORS WHO TRIED TO REPORTTHE CHEATING FACED A CULTURE OF
FEAR AND INTIMIDATION.
>> THERE WERE THREATS ANDINTIMIDATION.
>> WHAT KINDS OF THREATS ARE WETALKING ABOUT?
>> YOUR TIRES WOULD BE FLAT.
>> YOUR TIRES WOULD BE FLAT?
>> YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  IN NEW JERSEY,
THAT'S CONSIDERED A COMPLIMENT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I GOTTA SAY MORTGAGE LENDERINTIMIDATION IS PRETTY WEAK.
SOMETIMES I WOULD BRING YOGURTTO THE OFFICE, AND CHAD WOULD
EAT IT, EVEN THOUGH IT HADMY NAME ON IT.
SO MANY EERIE SIMILARITIES,THOUGH.
IT'S SORT OF HOW LINCOLN HAD ASECRETARY NAMED IT KENNEDY AND
KENNEDY BANGED HIS SECRETARY INTHE BACK OF A LINCOLN.
( LAUGHTER )
OR SOMETHING LIKE -- ANYWAY,THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWOSTORIES.
WHAT COULD IT BE?
>> THREE DISGRACED EDUCATORS,FORMER TEACHERS AND
ADMINISTRATORS, WERE SENTENCEDTO 20 YEARS.
THE OTHERS, INCLUDING APRINCIPAL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
TEACHERS, WERE SENTENCED TO FIVEYEARS, SERVING ONE TO TWO OF
THEM BEHIND BARS.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT.
AND?
>> A RECENT "NEW YORK TIMESMAGAZINE" STORY FOUND THAT
ONLY ONE PROSECUTION RELATING TOTHE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS LED TO
A CONVICTION AND JAIL TIME.
>> Jon:  I THINK I FOUNDTHE DIFFERENCE.
( LAUGHTER )PUNISHMENT!
THE TEACHERS AND SCHOOLADMINISTRATORS ARE GOING TO BE
PUNISHED WITH JAIL TIME, OR WHATTHEY MIGHT KNOW AS DETENTION
EXTREME RULES.
( LAUGHTER )WHEREAS THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL
SECTOR IS TIED, JAILTERM-WISE, WITH THE ECONOMY'S
EQUALLY CRITICAL "REALHOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY"
SECTOR.
OH, ACTUALLY, THEY'RE BEHIND, 2TO 1.
SO WHY DID THE TEACHERS RECEIVEJAIL TIME AND THE FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS FINES?
PERHAPS THIS NUGGET IN THE JUDGEWHO SENTENCED THE TEACHERS WILL
SHED LIGHT.
>> ALL I WANT FROM ANY OF THESEPEOPLE IS JUST TO TAKE SOME
RESPONSIBILITY.
>> Jon: THE TEACHERS WEREREMORSELESS.
THEY WERE CHEATERS WHO WOULDNEVER ADMIT TO WRONGDOING.
THAT'S THE CONTRAST.
AT LEAST THOSE WHOSE FINANCIALCRIMES NEARLY BROKE THE EARTH--
( LAUGHTER )WERE REMORSEFUL.
>> THE STATES REACHED A $325MILLION SETTLEMENT WITH
AMERIQUEST.
AMERIQUEST NEVER ADMITTED TO ANYWRONGDOING.
>> U.B.S. DID NOT ADMIT ANYWRONGDOING.
>> MORGAN STANLEY ISN'TADMITTING TO ANY WRONGDOING.
>> GOLDMAN SACHS WILL NOT ADMITANY WRONGDOING.
>> BANK OF AMERICA IS NOTADMITTING ANY WRONGDOING.
>> Jon:  WHO PAYS $300MILLION AND DOESN'T ADMIT
WRONGDOING?
SO THE THE NINE-FIGURE CASHSETTLEMENT IS NOT SO MUCH A FINE
AS IT IS, WHAT, A LITTLESOMETHING FOR THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT FOR LOOKING THE OTHERWAY?
GOOD THING JUSTICE IS BLINDBECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD
FOR HER, HA, HA.
HERE'S WHAT, SHE KNOWS SHEDIDN'T SEE NOTHING.
SO AT THE END OF ALL THIS, YOUHAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT
IS THIS HARSH PUNISHMENTFOR ATLANTA'S EDUCATORS
MEANT TO ACCOMPLISH.
>> MY HOPE IS THAT THIS VERDICTWHICH SHOWS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY
WILL SEND A SERIOUS MESSAGE.
>> Jon:  AND WHAT DID THELESS-HARSH PUNISHMENTS FOR WALL
STREET ACCOMPLISH?
>> A FEW YEARS AFTER THEMELTDOWN THAT IT'S STILL
BUSINESS AS USUAL INSIDE SOME OFTHESE WALL STREET BANKS.
>> I KNOW.
>> THE REASON NOTHING HASCHANGED ON WALL STREET IS
BECAUSE THE INCENTIVES ON WALLSTREET HAVE NOT CHANGED.
>> Jon:  PERHAPS WE CAN PUTTHIS LESSON IN STANDARDIZED TEST
FORM.
JOHNNY IS A CHEATING TEACHER ONA TRAIN TRAVELING 80 MILES PER
HOURS WEST TO JAIL.
CHARLIE IS A CHEATING WALLSTREET EXECUTIVE ON A TRAIN
TRAVELING 40 MILES PER HOUR...
I'M KIDDING.
IT'S A HELICOPTER AND HE'S GOINGTO A PARTY WHERE A GIANT ICE
SCULPTURE OF DAVID IS PEEINGVODKA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
