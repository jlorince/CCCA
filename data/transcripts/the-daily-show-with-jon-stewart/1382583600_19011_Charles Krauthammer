[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT PULITZER PRIZEWINNING JOURNALIST AND FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR HIS NEW BOOK ISCALLED "THINGS THAT MATTER:
THREE DECADES OF PASSIONS, PASTTIMES AND POLITICS."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THIS IS THE BOOK.
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT THEREIN HERE.
THERE YOU GO.
"THINGS THAT MATTER" 30 YEARS DOYOU EVER LOOK BACK AND THINK
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
>> IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: GO AHEAD.
>> THE WORST PART OF WRITING THEBOOK IS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK
AND READING THE MILLION WORDSI'D WRITTEN.
BY THE END OF THIS PROCESS I WASNEAR SUICIDAL.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'DWRITTEN SOME OF THAT
STUFF. >> Jon: WHAT HAS THEGROWTH PROCESS BEEN LIKE?
>> THE GROWTH PROCESS?
WELL, I WAS ONCE A LIBERAL.
-->> Jon: SO THE EARLY WRITINGS
SHOWED HOPE?
>> AND THEN CAME CHANGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
YOUR POLITICS HAVE SHIFTED FROMLIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE.
HERE IS MY ISSUE WITHCONSERVATIVE POLITICS AS THEY
STAND RIGHT NOW.
IT'S TOO EASY.
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THERESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNANCE.
IF YOUR MANTRA IS GOVERNMENTCANNOT HELP, THEN ANY CHAOS OR
LETHARGY THAT YOUSOW INTO THE GOVERNMENT HELPS
TO PROVE YOUR POINT. YOU HAVE NOINCENTIVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.
THAT WOULD BE TRUE BUTUNFORTUNATELY, THE ASSUMPTION
IS A CARICATURE. THESSUMPTIONCONSERVATIVE IDEA IS NOT THAT
GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE.
YOU MIGHT HAVE ARGUED THAT INTHE 30S WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES
ARGUED AGAINST THE NEW DEAL.
THERE'S NO QUESTION OF ACCEPTINGTHE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS OF
LIBERALISM, THE NEW DEAL, SOCIALSECURITY, MEDICAID, MEDICARE.
THE IDEA THAT YOU DON'T ALLOWTHE ELDERLY TO ENTER INTO
DESTITUTION IS A CONSENSUALIDEA THAT AT LEAST THE
MAINSTREAM OF CONSERVATIVES.
>> Jon: I WOULD SAY THAT THERHETORIC IS THE SAME.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RHETORIC WHENCONSERVATIVES OPPOSED THE NEW
DEAL, OPPOSED SOCIAL SECURITYAND MEDICARE IT'S IDENTICAL.
TED CRUZ QUOTES RONALD REAGAN'SMEDICARE SPEECH IN 1960
AS HE OPPOSED OBAMACARE.
>> TED CRUZ IS NOT THE SPOKESMAN>> TFOR CONSERVATIVES. AS ANSMAN
ALTERNATIVE, PAUL RYAN.
LET ME START WITH HISASSUMPTION.
IT'S NOT THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'THAVE A ROLE.
HIS ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEWELFARE STATE AS ESTABLISHED
WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY LIBERALSHAS NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT
NO LONGER FITS.
WITH THE NEW DEMOGRAPHICS ANDHIGHER TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE,
WE'LL SIMPLY BECOME INSOLVENTUNLESS WE RADICALLY REFORM.
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE FACT.
WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY WASINSTITUTED, THE AGE OF LONGEVITY
WAS 62.
TODAY LIFE EXPECTANCY IS 80.
SO WHAT YOU HAVE ISA HUGE CHANGE IN
THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND WHEN YOULOOK TO EUROPE WHICH IS THE
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC STATE WHEREWE'RE HEADED WHICH HAS ALL THE
ENTITLEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENTACTIVITIES WHICH A LIBERAL WOULD
WANT AND -- TO WHICH AMERICANLIBERALISM IS HEADED IT BECAME
INSOLVENT BECAUSE IT NEVERADAPTED TO THE CHANGE IN
DEMOGRAPHIC AND TECHNOLOGY.
>> Jon: IF IT WAS EVERPRESENTED IN THAT FASHION, THE
WAY YOU JUST PRESENTED IT, ITHINK THE CONVERSATION WE WOULD
BE HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY ISVERY DIFFERENT.
>> THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO BUYTHIS BOOK.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: SO THIS BOOK IS THE
ONE THAT PRESENTS IT.
>> ONE BOOK IS ALL YOU NEED.
THIS IS IT.
YOU DON'T NEED MORE.
>> Jon: EVEN PAUL RYAN DOESNOT PRESENT IT IN THE MANNER OF
THE GREAT VICTORIES OFLIBERALISM MEDICARE AND SOCIAL
SECURITY, THE GREAT SOCIALSAFETY NET THAT LIBERALS HAVE
HELPED BUILD AND FOUGHT FOR.
IT'S PRESENTED AS PROGRESSIVISMIS DESTROYING OUR NATION,
OBAMACARE IS GOING TO CHANGE USFROM NOT BEING AMERICA ANYMORE
AND I THINK GERMANY WOULD ARGUEWITH YOUR ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THAT
A SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC STATE CANNOTPROSPER AND CREATE WEALTH.
>> LOOK, YOU DON'T EXPECT APOLITICIAN TO SPEND HALF HIS
SPEECH PRAISING THE OTHER SIDE.
SO IT'S A MATTER OF TIMECONSTRAINTS.
I HAVE A LOT OF TIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]I HAVE THE BOOK DONE, I HAD 30
YEARS.
IT'S IN ONE BOOK.
EASY TO CARRY ON.
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK THIS ISTHE AUDIENCE THAT NEEDS TO READ
IT.
GIVE IT TO PAUL RYAN AND TEDCRUZ.
CRDON'T GIVE IT TO THEM, THEYKNOW.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND.
CANWE'LL BE BACK WITH CHARLESKRAUTHAMMER.
