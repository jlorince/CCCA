>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ERIC GREITENS,
HE'S THE FOUNDER OF THE MISSIONCONTINUES, A GREAT ORGANIZATION.
AUTHOR OF "RESILIENCE: HARD-WONWISDOM FOR LIVING A BETTER
LIFE."
BUT I WANT TO START TONIGHT BYTALKING ABOUT NOT A GOOD PERSON
LIKE ERIC GREITENS, BUT ATERRIBLE PERSON.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MANROTTEN TO HIS VERY CORE WHICH IS
IN ITSELF A TINY BLACK HOLEFROM WHICH NO JOY OR LIGHT CAN
ESCAPE.
THE ANCIENT COPTICS KNEW THISMAN AS "THE DARK ONE."
FRENCH PEASANTS REFERRED TO HIMAS LE MONSTRE AVEC LES DENTS --
( SPEAKING FRENCH )THE "THE JAGGED-TOOTH FOREST
DEMON WHO STEALS OUR CHILDREN"WHO STEALS OUR CHILDREN.
WE KNOW HIM AS FORMER VICEPRESIDENT DICK CHENEY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )NOW AND THEN,
NOW AND THEN HE SLITHERS OUTFROM HIS LAIR INSIDE A MOUNTAIN
OF KITTEN CORPSES AND GOES ONTV OR RADIO SAYING AWFUL THINGS.
USUALLY WE IGNORE IT, BUTSOMETIMES JUST CAN'T.
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU DEALTWITH IRAN A LOT, BOTH AS
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND EIGHTYEARS AS VICE PRESIDENT.
DO THEY STRIKE YOU AS APRACTICALLY MINDED OR
RESPONSIVE REGIME?
>> THIS IS A TOTALLY RADICALREGIME THAT IS THE PREMIER
SPONSOR OF STATE TERRORISM INTHE WORLD, AND OBAMA IS ABOUT
TO GIVE THEM NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
IT'S-- I CAN'T THINK OF A MORETERRIBLE BURDEN TO LEAVE THE
NEXT PRESIDENT THAN WHAT OBAMA'SCREATING HERE.
>> Jon:  REALLY?
YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANADMINISTRATION THAT LEFT A MORE
TERRIBLE BURDEN?( LAUGHTER )
THINK -- THINK HARD.
NO, WAIT.
THINK-- IF I CAN ASK YOU, THINKHARDER.
CAN YOU THINK-- MAYBE YOU NEED AVISUAL AID?
YOU CAN THINK OF ANADMINISTRATION THAT LEFT-- CAN
YOU-- ALL RIGHT.
BUT THAT WASN'T EVEN THE WORSTTHING CHENEY HAD TO SAY.
>> IS HE NAIVE?
>> IF YOU HAD SOMEBODY ASPRESIDENT WHO WANTED TO TAKE
AMERICA DOWN, WHO WANTED TOFUNDAMENTALLY WEAKEN OUR
POSITION IN THE WORLD, REDUCEOUR CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE
EVENTS, TURN OUR BACK ONOUR ALLIES AND ENCOURAGE
YOUR ADVERSARIES IT WOULDLOOK EXACTLY LIKE WHAT
BARACK OBAMA IS DOING.
>> Jon:  I-- WAH-- IS BARACKOBAMA A TRAITOR?
I DON'T-- WAH--( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S-- WAH-- ATRAITOR BUT HE DOES A GREAT
IMPRESSION OF A TRAITOR.
WAH.
( LAUGHTER )BUT BASICALLY THE VICE
PRESIDENT'S POINT APPEARS TO BETHIS-- ANYONE WHO STRENGTHENS
THE STRATEGIC POSITION OF IRANIS BY DEFINITION WORKING TO
WEAKEN THE UNITED STATES OFAMERICA.
SO I GUESS THE FORMULATION WOULDBE WHOEVER STRENGTHENED IRAN
MORE WOULD BE THE GREATER THREATTO AMERICA.
USING DICK CHENEY'S OWN METRICAS OUR BASELINE, CAN WE UNCOVER
A GREATER THREAT TO AMERICA THANEVEN BARACK OBAMA?

( LAUGHTER )REPRESENTED HERE BY A BALLOON
WITH A FROWNY FACE DRAWN ON IT.
( LAUGHTER )VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY, YOU'VE
LEVELED SOME SERIOUS CHARGESTHAT BARACK OBAMA HAS STRENGTHEN
IRAN.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CANTHINK OF OVER THE LAST SAY, I
DON'T KNOW, 12 YEARS AND 28 DAYSTHAT COULD ALSO BE SEEN AS
FUNDAMENTALLY STRENGTHENINGIRAN'S POSITION IN THAT REGION?
>> ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OFOUR INVASION OF IRAQ WAS
ULTIMATELY TO STRENGTHEN IRAN'SROLE AND INFLUENCE IN THE
REGIONS.
>> Jon:  AND WHO, SIR, WASRESPONSIBLE FOR THAT INVASION?
WHO, SIR!
I'LL LOOK IT UP IN MY HISTORYBOOK, HERE.
LET ME SEE. WHAT I CAN DO HERE.
WAH! WAH! WAH!
BY GUM, IT WAS YOU!
IT WAS YOU!

( CHEERS )I TAKE YOUR REDDENED FACE AS
EMBARRASSMENT!
( LAUGHTER )AND IF INVADING IRAQ NOT ONLY
REMOVED IRAN'S CLOSEST FOE, BUTCOMPLICATED AMERICA'S ABILITY TO
ACTIVELY COUNTERVAIL IRAN'SNUCLEAR PROGRAM, WELL, IN FACT,
ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONALATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY, BY THE END
OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION, VICEPRESIDENT CHENEY, IRAN HAD OVER
20 TIMES THE NUMBER OFURANIUM-ENRICHING CENTRIFUGES AS
WHEN YOU CAME INTO OFFICE.
AND THAT--( LAUGHTER )
COULD THAT NOT BE CONSIDEREDHANDING IRAN A NUCLEAR WEAPON,
SIR!
A CONCLUSION SO DAMNING IT CANONLY BE SPOKEN THROUGH TWO
DIFFERENT ORAL AFFECTATIONS.
( LAUGHTER )I SEE THE SMILE AND LINES AND
TOPOGRAPHY HAS GONE FROM YOURFACE.
( LAUGHTER )YES, DICK CHENEY, YOU TOOK OUT
IRAN'S ENEMIES WHILE GIVING IRANTIME TO BUILD UP THEIR NUCLEAR
PROGRAM.
BUT SURELY YOU COULD COURSECORRECT THIS BY JUST INSTALLING
IN IRAQ ANOTHER STRONGANTI-IRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S PLACE AS ANYAMERICA-LOVING VICE PRESIDENT
WOULD DO.
WHAT WAS YOUR MOVE, SIR?
>> IN BAGHDAD, WITH VIOLENCEGROWING, THE BUSH TEAM BEGAN
URGENTLY LOOKING FOR AN IRAQILEADER TO UNITE THE COUNTRY AND
STOP THE FIGHTING.
A C.I.A. OFFICER AT THE EMBASSYHAD A SUGGESTION-- A RELATIVELY
UNKNOWN SHIITE MEMBER OFPARLIAMENT,
NOURI KAMIL AL-MALIKI.
>> Jon:  AND THAT'S WHENMALIKI WALKED IN.
( LAUGHTER )AND THAT'S WHEN MALIKI WALKED
IN.
AND I DECIDED TO SHIFT GENRES.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
MALIKI-- HE WAS A HEART-STOPPINGDAME.
ACTUALLY, A MIDDLE-AGED IRAQIMAN.
HE CALLED HIMSELF AL-MALIKI.
AND HE HAD A PAIR OF GETAWAYSTICKS THAT WENT ALL THE WAY UP
FROM THE FLOOR TO HIS PELVICREGION LIKE A NORMAL ADULT.
WHO WAS THIS BRAVE, FUTURE ENEMYOF IRAN?
>> FOR 25 YEARS, THIS GUY'S BEENA HARD-LINE SHIITE SECTARIAN
POLITICIAN.
WHEN HE WAS IN EXILE FROM SADDAMHUSSEIN'S REGIME, HE LIVED IN
IRAN.
HE WAS FUNDED BY THE IRANIANS.
>> Jon:  FOR AN AMERICANADMINISTRATION TO REPLACE SADDAM
HUSSEIN WITH A MAN EMBOLDENEDAND INDEBTED TO OUR GREATEST
REGIONAL ENEMY, ACCORDING TODICK CHENEY'S OWN LOGIC, ANYONE
WHO TRUSTED MALIKI WOULD HAVE TOBE NAIVE OR DELIBERATELY TRYING
TO WEAKEN AMERICA.
>> DO YOU TRUST NOURI AL-MALIKI?
>> I DO.
AT THIS POINT I DON'T HAVE ANYREASON NOT TO TRUST HIM.

WELL, IT SEEMS YOU'RE GETTINGSWEAT ON YOUR BROW!

AH, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
JUST ONE MORE THING, ONE MORETHING.
( LAUGHTER )ONE MORE THING, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT.
I JUST CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MYMIND.
CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MYMIND.
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THERE WASA REASON WHY YOU WOULD NEVER
WANT AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTTO DEAL WITH IRAN AND
YOU'VE THOUGHT SO FOR QUITESOME TIME, ISNT THAT TRUE?
>> IRANIANS HAVE ENDURED AGENERATION OF REPRESSION AT THE
HANDS OF A FANATICAL REGIME.
THAT REGIME IS ONE OF THEWORLD'S PRIMARY STATE SPONSORS
OF TERRORISM.
>> Jon: STATE SPONSORS OFTERRORISM SO YOU YOURSELF WOULD
NEVER DO SOMETHING OR ENGAGEWITH A REGIME SUCH AS THAT FOR
THEIR BENEFIT, OR PERHAPS YOURS,EVEN WHEN LET'S SAY IN 1998 YOU
WERE THE C.E.O. OF A GIANT OILSERVICES COMPANY --
WHAT WAS THE NAME AGAIN?
HALLIBURTON, I THINK ITWAS CALLED!
HALLIBURTON.
>> WE FIND OURSELVES THESE DAYS,AMERICAN FIRMS, CUT OUT OF THE
ACTION IN TERMS OF ANYTHING THATDEVELOPS WITH RESPECT TO IRAN.
UNFORTUNATELY, AS HAS BEENPOINTED OUT REPEATEDLY, IN
RECENT WEEKS, OUR GOVERNMENTHAS BECOME SANCTIONS HAPPY.
>> Jon:  VERY INTERESTING.
YOU, SIR, WERE ARGUING FOR THEUNITED STATES TO LIFT SANCTIONS
ON IRAN SO YOUR COMPANYHALLIBURTON COULD GET
CONTRACTS WITH THIS RADICALREGIME,
CONTRACTS WORTH MILLIONSOF DOLLARS.
AND PARDON ME IF I'M IMPUGNINGYOUR CHARACTER, I HATE TO DO IT,
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF A MANWHOSE FINAL ACT IN THE BUSINESS
WORLD BEFORE JOINING THEAMERICAN GOVERNMENT AS VICE
PRESIDENT WOULD BE TO ENTER INTOCONTRACTS WITH THE NUMBER ONE
STATE SPONSOR OR OF OFTERROR JUST BEFORE
LEAVING TO BECOMEBUSH'S RUNNING MATE?
CONTRACTS THAT WERE ONLY LEGALBECAUSE YOU DID THEM THROUGH A
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY, MR. CHENEYAND THEN ONCE YOU WERE IN
OFFICE, IN GRATITUDE FOR IRAN'SMONEY, YOU HAND IRAN THE
GREATEST PRIZE OF ALL-- IRAQ.
ISN'T IT YOU, SIR, WHO IS THEDOUBLE AGENT DETERMINED TO BRING
AMERICA DOWN!
ISN'T IT YOU-- HE'S GETTINGAWAY!
HE'S GETTING AWAY!
HE'S GETTING-- WAIT-- HE'SGETTING-- DAMN YOU, DICK CHENEY!
