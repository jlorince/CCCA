>> DELIGHTED TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: COULDN'T BE MOREHONORED, SIR.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU JUSTTO GET A CONTEXT OF THIS.
BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE ATENDENCY, EVEN IN THE
IMAGES, YOU SEE THEM, THEYARE BLACK AND WHITE.
THEY TEND TO FEEL LIKEPRE-HISTORY, THAT THEY ARE NOT
RECENT HISTORY FORAMERICANS.
WHEN DID YOU BEGIN YOURJOURNEY INTO THE CIVIL
RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
>> I GREW UP IN RURALALABAMA, 50 MILES FROM
MONTGOMERY OUTSIDE OF ALITTLE PLACE CALLED TROY.
AND I WAS ONLY ABOUT 7 OR 8YEARS OLD.
WE WOULD GO DOWNTOWN TO THETHEATER.
AND ALL OF US LITTLE BLACKCHILDREN HAD TO GO UPSTAIRS TO
THE BALCONY.
AND ALL OF THE LITTLE WHITECHILDREN WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO
THE FIRST FLOOR.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ASKED MY MOTHER, MYFATHER, MY GRANDPARENTS,
MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS WHY.
THEY WOULD SAY THAT'S THE WAY ITIS.
DON'T GET IN THEIR WAY.
DON'T GET IN TROUBLE.
I SAW THE SIGNS AT THE WATERFOUNTAIN SAYING WHITE AND
COLORED.
BUT IN 1955, 15 YEARS OLD, IHEARD OF ROSA PARKS,
HEARD DR. KING ON THE RADIO.
AND THE ACTION OF ROSA PARKS,THE WORDS AND LEADERSHIP OF
DR. KING INSPIRED ME.
AND WHEN I WAS 17 I MET ROSAPARKS.
THE NEXT YEAR, 1958 I METMARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
CHANGED MY LIFE.
AND INSPIRED ME TO FIND AWAY TO GET IN THE WAY.
AND I GOT IN TROUBLE.
BUT I CALL GOOD TROUBLE.
NECESSARY TROUBLE.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WHEN YOU MET
DR. KING, WAS IT DIFFICULTTO GET A MEETING WITH
DR. KING?
AND WHEN YOU MET DR. KING,WAS IT, DID YOU JUST WANT TO
GET INVOLVED?
BECAUSE YOU BECAME ONE OFTHE FIRST FREEDOM RIDERS.
>> WELL,  I WROTE HIM A LETTER.
I WANTED TO ATTEND A LITTLECOLLEGE TEN MILES FROM OUR
HOME.
I NEVER HEARD A WORD FROMTHE COLLEGE.
SO I WROTE HIM A LETTER.
HE WROTE ME BACK AND SENT MEA ROUND TRIP GREYHOUND BUS
TICKET.
AND I TRAVELED FROM THAT LITTLETOWN OF TROY TO MONTGOMERY.
AND A YOUNG LAWYER PICKED MEUP AT THE BUS STATION AND
TOOK ME TO THIS CHURCH. PASSINGBY THEY REVEREND RALPH
ABERNATHY, A COLLEAGUEOF DR. KING'S.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND USHERED ME INTO THEOFFICE OF THE CHURCH.
AND I SAW DR. MARTINLUTHER KING, JR. AND REVEREND
RALPH ABERNATHY STANDINGBEHIND THE DESK.
I WAS SO SCARED.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ORWHAT TO DO.
AND DR. KING SAID ARE YOUTHE BOY FROM TROY?
>> Jon: WOW.
>> ARE YOU JOHN LEWIS?
AND I SAID DR. KING, I AMJOHN ROBERT LEWIS.
I GAVE MY WHOLE NAME.
AND HE STARTED CALLING METHE BOY FROM TROY.
>> Jon: WHAT AN AMAZINGEXPERIENCE.
HOW GREAT A WRITER MUST YOUHAVE BEEN TO SEND THIS MAN A
LETTER THAT HE THOUGHT WE'VE GOTTO GET THIS GUY OVER TO
THE OFFICE.
>> WELL, HE SAW SOMETHING IN ME.
MAYBE HE SAW SOMETHING IN MYHANDWRITING.

SO LET'S GO TO, SO HERE'S THENEXT IMAGE.
THIS IS YOU'VE JUST CROSSED THEBRIDGE AND THIS IS, I GUESS,
IS THIS THE POLICE FORCE FROMTHE TOWN?

AND WE GET TO THIS POINT,THE STATE TROOPER SPEAKS UP
AND SAYS THIS IS AN UNLAWFULMARCH.

THEY STARTED BEATING US WITHNIGHT STICKS.

WE WERE SO PEACEFUL. IT WASLIKE MILITARY DISCIPLINE.
AND WE BELIEVED IN THEPHILOSOPHY AND THE
DISCIPLINE OF NONVIOLENCE.
WE HAD BEEN TAUGHT, WE HADBEEN TRAINED.
WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE ITFROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY, TO
DRAMATIZE TO THENATION AND TO THE WORLD THAT
PEOPLE OF COLOR IN ALABAMAWANTED TO REGISTER TO VOTE.
AND A PLACE LIKE SELMA, ONLY2.1 PERCENT OF BLACK PEOPLE
VOTING AGE WERE REGISTERED TOVOTE.
YOU HAD TO PASS A SO-CALLEDLITERACY TEST.
>> Jon: YEAH.

OF SOAP, THE NUMBER OF JELLYBEANS IN A JAR.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE WERE BLACK LAWYERS ANDDOCTORS AND TEACHERS AND COLLEGE
PROFESSORS WHO WERE TOLDTHEY COULD NOT READ AN WRITE
WELL ENOUGH.
SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT.

THEY ARE STILL VERY VITALMEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY WHO
STILL BORE WITNESS TO THAT,AND IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT
LESSON FOR PEOPLE TODAY.
