MAN OSCAR WINNER CLINT EASTWOOD.
(APPLAUSE) NOT THAT ROMNEY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO-- YOU KNOW, I THINK HE TALKED TOO.
>> WE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS FELT A SPECIAL KINSHIP WITH THE FUTURE.
>> Jon: YES, YES, WE AMERICANS UNIQUELY AMONG EARTH'S PEOPLE, MOVE FORWARD IN TIME.
LOOK, I DON'T--  (LAUGHTER) I DON'T CARE HOW MANY MARCO'S RUBIO YOU PUT IN BETWEEN
CLINT EASTWOOD AND MITT ROMNEY, ROMNEY AIN'T OUTSHINING THIS LITTLE PLAYLET I LIKE TO CALL THE
OLD MAN AND THE SEAT.
AND HERE'S WHY--  (LAUGHTER) IT HURTS-- HERE'S WHY IT HURTS.
IT HURT THESE REPUBLICANS BAD BECAUSE THIS CONVENTION LIKE ALL CONVENTIONS IS A
SCRIPTED AND FOCUSED GROUP FANTASY AND THE DISPLAY OF EASTWOOD'S GRAN TORINO ID
WAS THE VERY THING REPUBLICANS HAD CONSTRUCTED THE ENTIRE WEEK TO SUPPRESS.
THIS CONVENTION WAS THE VISION OF A PERFECT AMERICA,
THAT USE ODD TO EXIST UNTIL BARACK OBAMA RUINED IT, AND SO WHAT IF THAT AMERICA HAD
NEVER ACTUALLY EXISTED.
>> TO BE AN AMERICAN WAS TO ASSUME THAT ALL THINGS WERE POSSIBLE, THAT UNIQUE BLEND
OF OPTIMISM, HUMILITY, IT'S THAT GOOD FEELING WHEN YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO VOLUNTEER
TO COACH YOUR KID'S SOCCER TEAM OR HELP OUT ON SCHOOL TRIPS.
IT'S WHEN WE SEE THAT NEW BUSINESS OPENING UP DOWNTOWN.
IT'S WHEN WE GO TO WORK IN THE MORNING AND SEE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE BLOCK
DOING THE SAME THING.
MY FRIENDS CARED MORE ABOUT WHAT SPORTS TEAMS WE FOLLOWED THAN WHAT CHURCH WE WENT TO.
>> Jon: GEE WHIZ, POPS, THAT SOUNDS AWESOME.
YEAH, THAT WAS THE UNCOMPLICATED AMERICA YOU REMEMBER.
I THINK IN THE EARLY 6030s THERE WERE SOME CHURCHES IN ALABAMA THAT WOULD HAVE
DISAGREED WITH YOUR SPORTS TEAM VERSUS PLACE OF WORSHIP ANECDOTE.
BUT THE POINT IS THIS-- WHAT THIS CONVENTION ATTEMPTED TO DO IS SAY THAT WE COULD ALL
LIVE AGAIN IN THIS NOSTALGIC PARADISE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS ONE [BLEEP] GUY!
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS DISAPPOINTED AMERICA BECAUSE HE HASN'T LEAD AMERICA IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
>> BARACK OBAMA'S FAILED US.
WEAKENED AMERICA'S CONFIDENCE.
>> DIMINISHED THE DREAMS.
>> LIBERTY LIMITING RADICAL LEFT WING ANTI-BUSINESS RECKLESS SPENDING TAX HIKING
PARTY OF BARACK OBAMA-- .
>> Jon: HEY, HIS WIFE IS NICE THOUGH, I LIKE HIS WIFE,
HEH.
WOW, IT'S FOUR YEARS, ONE MAN, BARACK OBAMA HAS BROKEN THE GREATEST NATION GOD HAS
EVER GIVE THEN EARTH.
THE MESSAGE OF THIS CONVENTION IS THAT APPARENTLY UP UNTIL AROUND NOVEMBER OF 2008 AMERICANS
LIVED IN A UTOPIAN IDEAL BORN OF OUR OWN GUMPTION AND INDIVIDUAL HARD WORK BUT
SADLY NOW, NOT FOUR YEARS LATER IT IS A BLYTHED SOCIALIST HELL SCAPE WITH
JACK FOOTED THUGS LOCK YOU UP FOR THINKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS.
AND HERE IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE PART OF THE ENTIRE FICTION.
WHILE CONVINCING US THAT BARACK OBAMA'S DESTROYED THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE, THE
REPUBLICANS HAVE ALSO INVENTED A PAST WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM SUCCEED.
>> THAT CHOICE WAS NOT THE CHOICE OF OUR PARTY BUT AMERICANS ALWAYS COME
TOGETHER AFTER ELECTIONS.
>> I WISH PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD SUCCEEDED BECAUSE I WANT AMERICA TO SUCCEED.
BZ BULL [BLEEP] [BLEEP].
>>  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU WANTED OBAMA TO SUCCEED?
WE MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT AMERICA WAS NEVER REALLY MAYBERRY, BUT WE SURE AS
[BLEEP] CAN REMEMBER BACK TO 2009.
THIS IS THE NEWS PACKAGE FROM HANNITY'S SHOW, 100 DAYS INTO THE PRESIDENCY.
>> SO HELP YOU GOD.
>> SO HELP ME GOD.
>> CONGRAT LAKESES.
-- CONGRATULATIONS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELL, HE DID GIVE THE PRESIDENT 100 DAYS BEFORE CUING UP THE SONG FROM THE OMEN.
(LAUGHTER) ANYBODY LESS FORGIVING?
>>.
>> THE ECONOMY IS SO BAD AND SO SHAKY, AND THE OBAMA VISION HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL,
ZERO.
NOW AGAIN, IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX WEEKS, BUT IT ISN'T WORKING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I MEAN COME ON, THE GUY'S HAD 42 DAYS TO BIGGEST THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL
CATASTROPHE IN HIS LIFETIME.
HE HAD HIS CHANCE.
BUT STILL 42 DAYS IS 42 DAYS.
ANYBODY WANT TO JUMP ON THE I HOPE HE FAILS BAND WAG ORNTION I DON'T KNOW, EIGHT
DAYS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY.
>> RUSH LIMBAUGH AS YOU KNOW,
GOVERNOR, HAS TAKEN A LOT OF HEAT FOR SAYING THAT HE DOES NOT WISH THIS PRESIDENT WELL.
>> RUSH IS PARTIALLY RIGHT,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND PARS WORDS HERE BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT FAILED
POLICIES TO SUCCEED.
>> Jon: I MEAN IT'S BEEN EIGHT DAYS.
WE'VE BEEN WAITING AN ENTIRE HANUKKAH FOR OBAMA TO SUCCEED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HASN'T FIXED IN 8 DAYS WHAT
