YOU KNOW, PERHAPS FOX IS RIGHTTO BE WARY OF BERGDAHL'S DAD.
AFTER ALL, WHEN HE WAS INVITEDTO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE DID SAY
SOMETHING STRANGE.
>> I'D LIKE TO SAY BOWE RIGHTNOW, WHO IS HAVING TROUBLE
SPEAKING ENGLISH, BISMILLAHAL-RAHMAN AL-RAHIM.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: OH, NO YOU DID NOT!
WHAT WAS THAT PART THERE, BUDDYBOY?
CAN WE GET TRANSLATION ON THAT?
>> EVERY TIME MUSLIMS CONQUER APLACE AND LOCATION, THEY WOULD
STAND AND READ THE FATAHBASICALLY DECLARING THE
GREATNESS OF ALLAH OVER THATLAND.
SO WHAT THE FATHER OF BERGDAHLDID IS EXACTLY THAT, WHICH THE
TALIBAN AND THE ISLAMISTRADICALS ALL THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD WILL PERCEIVE AS A VICTORYSTANDING ON THE STEPS OF THE
WHITE HOUSE.
>> Jon: [BLEEPED].
WHILE WE WERE FOCUSED ON BOWEBERGDAHL, HIS FATHER CAST SOME
KIND OF MUSLIM HARRY POTTERCURSE AND CONQUERED THE WHITE
HOUSE.
WHITE HOUSE DOWN!
OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN.
FANCY HOUSE IS IN THE TOILET.
THAT ONE HASN'T BEEN MADE YET.
ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD BE A GOODONE.
AND THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION TOBERGDAHL'S VERBAL CONQUEST OF
AMERICA DID NOT GO UNNOTICED.
>> AND THE PRESIDENT, YOU CANSEE THE PRESIDENT SMILING THERE
AS HE SAYS IT.
>> Jon: YES.
YES, SEAN HANNITY.
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES, SMILING, AS HIS
COMRADE DELIVERS THE MUSLIM WARCONQUER CALL IN THE ROSE GARDEN,
THUS HANDING CONTROL OF THEUNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO
RADICAL ISLAM.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TOSAY? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I'M RECEIVING THE FULL SUBTEXTOF YOUR BOOBERY.
WE ALL KNOW IF BUSH WAS STILL INOFFICE THE MUSLIM CONQUER
VICTORY CALL WOULD NEVER HAVEBEEN DELIVERED -- I'M SORRY.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE][CLEARS THROAT]
♪ MAMA MUSLIMMAMA MUSLIM
♪ MAMA MUSLIM LET HIM GO ♪SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S LESS
A CONQUERING WAR CRY THAN ONE OFYOUR STANDARD OFFERING OF
BLESSINGS. BY THE WAY, ALL THISCONVERSATION OF THE DEAL WE DID
FOR BERGDAHL IS ONLY OUTOF CONCERN FOR AMERICA'S SAFETY.
>> WE'VE LET LOOSE FIVE TALIBANHARDENED KILLERS.
>> THE TALIBAN ARE GOING TO BERIGHT BACK THERE AND AMERICA'S
GOING TO BE IN THE BULL'S EYE.
>> THIS IS A GREAT DANGER TOAMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY, NOT
JUST IN KIDNAPPED AMERICANS, BUTIN ATTACKS ON AMERICAN SOIL.
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I GUESSTHAT COULD BE.
THERE COULD BE ATTACKS ONAMERICAN SOIL, BUT NOW THAT
THEY'RE OUT, THE ISLAMICEXTREMIST THREAT IS BOUNDLESS.
THEY COULD WREAK HAVOC AT ANYMOMENT, AT ANY PLACE, WHILE
SHOUTING FOR REVOLUTION WHILEATTACKING AMERICANS.
>> THAT DEADLY LAS VEGASSHOOTING OVER THE WEEKEND A
MARRIED COUPLE YELLING, "THIS ISA REVOLUTION" AS THEY
GUNNED TWO TWO POLICEMENAT A PIZZA PLACE.
>> THE TWO CLAIM TO HAVE BEENINVOLVED IN STANDOFF AT BUNDY'S
RANCH.
>> Jon: OH WELL, DON'T WORRYABOUT THAT.
BECAUSE WE JUST NEED TO PROTECTTHIS COUNTRY FROM TERRORISTS
WITH BEARDS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
