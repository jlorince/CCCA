>> Jon:  HEY, WELCOME TO THE"DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART. NICESHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERYEXCITED, MY GUEST TONIGHT A VERY
IMPRESSIVE YOUNG MAN, WES MOORE,AUTHOR OF A BOOK CALLED "THE
WORK: MY SEARCH FOR A LIFE THATMATTERS."
VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HIM ONTHE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
BUT FIRST, IF I MAY, THE114th UNITED STATES CONGRESS
IS ONE MONTH OLD-- ONE MONTH!
HAS THE NEW REPUBLICAN CONTROLCHANGED THE WAY CONGRESS DOES
BUSINESS?
THE RECIPE FOR MAKINGLEGISLATIVE SAUSAGE AS IT WERE?
WE EXAMINE IT IN OUR NEWSEGMENT-- REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
CAN WE JUST-- I'M SORRY, CAN WEJUST-- IF WE COULD JUST DO
SOMETHING SLIGHTLY--( LAUGHTER )
DO WE HAVE ANOTHER SEGMENT THATI COULD--
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I'M OKAY WITH THE FIRST ONE.
LET'S JUST DO -- THANK YOU VERYMUCH.
NOW, LET'S GET ONE THINGSTRAIGHT.
THIS ISN'T ONE OF YOUR LAMEGRID LOCKED 113th CONGRESSES.
JUST ASK SENATE MAJORITY LEADERMITCH McCONNELL.
>> WE NEED TO OPEN UP-- OPEN UPTHE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN A WAY
THAT ALLOWS MORE AMENDMENTS FROMBOTH SIDES.
SOMETIMES IT'S GONNA BEMEANING-- IT'LL MEAN WORKING
LATE, BUT RESTORING THE SENATEIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> Jon:  YUP.
( LAUGHTER )SURE.
WORKING LATE.
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY, MITCHMcCONNELL.
YOU CARRY YOUR HOUSE AROUND ONYOUR BACK.
SO YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO GOHOME.
( LAUGHTER )BECAUSE I BELIEVE-- AND I'M
BEING COMPLETELY SERIOUS RIGHTNOW-- SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
MITCHELL McCONNELL IS ATURTLE.
( LAUGHTER )WHAT SPECIES?
I CANNOT SAY.
ALTHOUGH HIS NATIVE HABITATBEING KENTUCKY MY GUESS IS THAT
THE HIGHEST RANKING REPUBLICANSENATOR IS EITHER AN EASTERN BOX
TURTLE, A COMMON MUSK TURTLEOR -- I THINK THIS PERHAPS
MOST LIKELY-- A RIVER COOTER.
IF THE SIXTH TERM SEEING YOURSENATOR FROM KENTUCKY WOULD LIKE
TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO REFUTETHIS CHARGE, YOUR MOVE!
YOUR SLOW, DELIBERATE MOVE.
PERHAPS YOU WILL ALLOW ME TOSWEETEN THE DEAL.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I THINK ARBY'S JUST WENT WHEW.
BUT THE POINT IS, McCONNELL,IN CONTRAST TO FORMER MAJORITY
LEADER HARRY REID, IS ALLOWINGSENATORS TO PROPOSE WHATEVER
AMENDMENTS THEY WANT TOLEGISLATION.
HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WASTHE KEYSTONE PIPELINE.
I CAN ONLY ASSUME TO USE ASA MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IN HIS
ATTEMPT TO-- AS SEEN HERE--CATCH SUPER MARIO, UTILIZING
SOME KIND OF--( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )I LOOK-- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE
NEW AMENDMENT POLICY PAYINGSWIFT AND EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE
DIVIDENDS.
>> IT IS AN EXTREMELY SIMPLEAMENDMENT.
>> THE EFFECTIVE LANGUAGE ISONLY EIGHT WORDS, "CLIMATE
CHANGE IS REAL AND NOT A HOAX."
>> THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALAND THAT HUMAN ACTIVITY
SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TOCLIMATE CHANGE.
>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHNHOEVEN FROM NORTH DAKOTA.
YOU THEN PUT ONE IN THAT SAYSTHE SAME THING BUT TAKING THE
WORD "SIGNIFICANTLY" OUT.
WHY DID YOU WANT THE WORD"SIGNIFICANTLY" TAKEN OUT OF
THERE?
>> BECAUSE, LOOK, IT WAS ABOUTFINDING THAT BALANCE THAT WILL
BRING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO THEBILL.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  IF TAKE OUT THE
WORD "SIGNIFICANTLY" WAS A WAYTO BRING REPUBLICANS ON BOARD
WHY NOT JUST DRAFT THE AMENDMENTAS HUMAN ACTIVITY CONTRIBUTES TO
CLIMATE CHANGE. HEY,REMEMBER RONALD REAGAN.
THE WASN'T HE GREAT.
THREE CHEERS FORTHE DEATH PENALTY.
HIP HIP HOORAY!
BUT LISTEN, THAT'S -- THAT'S THESENATE WHERE IT'S ALL PASSIVE
AGGRESSIVE I'M GONNA CHANGE ONEWORD TYPE DIGS.
FOR OPEN UNADULTATED AGGRESSION
YOU'VE GOT TO DROP BY THE HOUSEFOR THE COMMITTEE DEBATE ON THE
9,000th VOTE TO REPEALOBAMACARE.
>> THE ADMINISTRATION HID THEBALL. HAD THE ADMINISTRATION
WORKED WITH THE GOVERNORSWE MIGHT BE TALKING
ABOUT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT --
>> HAD THE ADMINISTRATION WORKEDWITH THE GOVERNORS.
HAD THE GOVERNORS WORKED WITHTHE ADMINISTRATION WE MIGHT NOT
BE IN THIS POSITION. NOW, IDON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR STATE,
WHICH I THINK IS A CRAZY STATETO BEGIN WITH,
AND I MEAN THATJUST AS I SAID IT.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  HASTINGS JUSTSTRAIGHT UP MESSED WITH TEXAS.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S THE ONE THING TEXAS WARNS
EVERYONE NOT TO DO.
WHERE'S THIS BALLSY YOUNG MANFROM, ANYWAY?
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA ISRECOGNIZED.
>> I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: WAIT, YOU'REFROM FLORIDA?
YOU'RE FROM FLORIDA AND YOU'RECALLING TEXAS CRAZY?
( LAUGHTER )YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL OUT
OKLAHOMA FOR ALSOHAVING A PANHANDLE.
HEY, OKLAHOMA, NICE PANHANDLESTICKING OUT OF YOUR STATE.
WHY DON'T YOU GRAB HOLD OF YOURFUGLY ASS PANHANDLE AND MAKE ME
SOME PANCAKES YOU EXTRAAPPENDAGE HAVING
PIECE OF  ( BLEEP ).
YOU'RE FROM FLORIDA.
YOU CAN'T CALL OTHER STATESCRAZY.
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT KIND OFFRAGRANT TEX-MESSING,
WELL THAT'S NOT GOING TOGO UNREMARKED UPON.
>> MADE A VERY  DEFLAMMATORYSTATEMENT ABOUT MY STATE AND I
WILL NOT STAND HERE AND LISTENTO IT.
>> Jon:  WE ARE RUN BYCHILDREN.
NOW, LET'S ALL CALM DOWN.
I'M SURE CONGRESSMAN HASTINGS,HE REALIZES HE WENT A LITTLE TOO
FAR.
LET'S GIVE HIM A CHANCE TOAPOLOGIZE TO THE GOOD SIR FROM
TEXAS.
>> WELL, FINE.
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN.
YOU CAN LEAVE IF YOU CHOOSE.
I TOLD YOU WHAT I THINK ABOUTTEXAS.
I WOULDN'T LIVE THERE FOR ALLTHE TEA IN CHINA.
( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS )
>> Jon:  HE'S CRUSHING THISDUDE.
HE DOUBLED DOWN.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN.
YOU STILL COME FROM A CRAZYSTATE.
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T REALLYUNDERSTAND THE "ALL THE TEA IN
CHINA" REFERENCE.
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S APOSITIVE.
THAT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BURDEN.
THAT'S A LOT OF TEA.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU KEEPTHAT MUCH TEA.
YOU REALLY, YOU GET THAT MUCHTEA, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
GET CRUSHED BY ABILLION TEA BAGS.
IT'S NOT-- ALL RIGHT.
TWO SOLID SLAMS AGAINST TEXAS.
NOW IF HASTINGS WANTS TOMAINTAIN A PROFESSIONAL
RELATIONSHIP HERE, I DO THINK,OUT OF PROTOCOL, OUT OF
RESPECT, PERHAPS IT'S TIME FORHIM TO START WALKING THIS BACK.
>> I'M USED TO ATTACKS ANDINVECTIVES BEING TOSSED MY WAY.
THAT'S PARSE AND PARCEL WITH THETERRITORY.
BUT THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL TOIMPUGN THE PEOPLE, THE GOVERNOR
OF A STATE OF THIS COUNTRY AND IWILL AWAIT THE GENTLEMAN'S
APOLOGY.
I YIELD BACK.
>> YOU WILL WAIT UNTIL HELLFREEZES OVER.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  OH!
MY!
GOD!
WHAT!
THIS MAN, THIS CONGRESSMANHASTINGS TRULY DOES NOT GIVE A
SINGLE ( BLEEP ).
JUST LOOK AT HIM SITTING THERECASUALLY READING.
IN FACT, CAN WE-- CAN WE ZOOM INON WHAT HE'S READING?
NO ( BLEEP ) MONTHLY!
AND WHAT'S THAT SUB ARTICLE?
"ARE YOU GIVING TOO MANY( BLEEP )."
OH YEAH -- WOW, WOW.
SOME PRETTY HARSH WORDS THERE.
BUT WHAT IF IT DOESN'T END?
WHAT IF CONGRESSMAN HASTINGSJUST FIRED THE FIRST SHOT IN
WHAT WILL SOON BECOME AN ALL-OUTFLORIDA-TEXAS CONFLAGRATION.
TEXAS FIRST SENDS OVER SOMERANGERS ON HORSEBACK.
FLORIDA ANTICIPATES THE MOVE,SENDING OUT SEX SPRING BREAKERS
TO DISTRACT THEM.
MEANWHILE, ONE MAN FLORIDAWRECKING CREW GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
IS PARACHUTED DEEP INTO TEXASTERRITORY.
BUT BEFORE ZIMMERMAN CAN STANDHIS GROUND HE IS TAKEN OUT BY
LEATHER FACE, TEXAS CHAINSAWSTYLE.
THEN FLORIDA RETALIATES BYSENDING OUT AN ELITE SQUADRON
OF ALLIGATORS HIGH ON THE BATHSALTS.
IMMEDIATELY NEUTRALIZED BY ATEXAS-RELEASED LETHAL COCKTAIL
OF CRUDE OIL, MESQUITE BARBECUESAUCE, AND
CHUCK ( BLEEP ) NORRIS.
AND THEN WHEN THE ( BLEEP )ABOUT YOU GET REALLY UGLY,
UT PLAYS FLORIDA IN FOOTBALLAND EVERYBODY HAS A
BIG TAILGATE PARTY ANDFORGETS ABOUT THE WAR.
HOOK THEM GATOR HORNS.
WHICH IS REALLY A SHAME.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO WOULD HAVEWON A FLORIDA-TEXAS WAR?
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. WE'LLBE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( LAUGHTER )
