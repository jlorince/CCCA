SO BAD.
A LOT LESS MOON DEATHS IN HIS
PRESIDENCY.
ANY LIBRARY WILL HAVE TO GRAPPLE
WITH THE DECISION MADE BY THIS
PRESIDENT-- IRAQ, KATRINA, THE
FINANCIAL CRISE.
>> VISITORS CAN GO AND THEY CAN
GET ACTUAL ADVICE FROM THE REAL
ADVISERS TO PRESIDENT BUSH, AND
IT ALLOWS VISITORS TO MAKE
DECISIONS LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH
DID.
ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF THIS
MUSEUM IS WHAT'S CALLED THE
DECISION POINT THEATER.
IT'S AN INTERACTIVE EXHIBIT.
>> Jon:  YEAH, I GUESS
THAT'S BETTER THAN ITS ORIGINAL
TITLE-- "DISASTERPIECE THEATRE."
FOR MORE, WE GO LIVE TO
ALMADRIGAL WHO JUST FINISHED HIS
TOUR OF THE GEORGE W. BUSH
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY.
AL, YOU FINISHED THE TOUR--
WAIT, WHAT IS THAT IN YOUR HAND?
>> GEORGE W. BUSH STAKE ON A
STICK, JON.
STEAK ON A ( BLEEP ) STICK.
THIS IS LITERALLY THE GREATEST
LIBRARY EVER.
THE EXHIBITS, STATE-OF-THE-ART.
THE ARCHITECTURE IS SIMPLE YET
ELEGANT.
I USED THE BATHROOM.
I DON'T THINK IT HAD EVER BEEN
TOUCHED BEFORE.
WAY IN THE BARK SO QUIET, SO
CLEAN.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, AL,
LET'S NOT--
>> IT WAS LIKE TAKING A DUMP IN
A BRAND NEW CADILLAC.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S NICE WHEN YOU FIND THOSE
SPOTS.
>> AFTER-- AFTER A COUPLE OF
THESE BAD BOYS I HAD A LITTLE
SHOCK AND AWE OF MY OWN.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
CAN WE-- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE
MUSEUM?
>> YUP.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
DECISION POINTS THEATER,
AMAZING.
I ACED IT BY THE WAY.
INVAED IRAQ?
YES.
RESCUE NEW ORLEANS?
NO.
BAIL OUT WALL STREET?
PASS THE CHECKBOOK.
>> Jon:  AL, WHY, KNOWING
WHAT WE KNOW NOW, DID YOU CHOOSE
"YES" ON INVADING IRAQ.
>> THE CHOICES WERE A., LEAVE A
MAD MAN IN POWER WHO WILL
DESTROY WESTERN CIVILIZATION.
OR B., BE A LITTLE BITCH.
>> Jon:  WHAT?
( LAUGHTER )
>> HARD TO CHOOSE B THERE, JON.
>> GL JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
COULD YOU CHOOSE B.
WHAT IF YOU HAD CHOSEN NOT TO
INVADE?
>> A VIDEO OF GEORGE W. BUSH
COMES UP AND TELLS YOU THAT YOU
MADE THE WRONG DECISION.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU'RE MAKING THAT
UP, RIGHT?
>> NO, NO, NO, THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GEORGE W.
BUSH MUSEUM.
( LAUGHTER ).
FOR REAL.
>> Jon:  SO WHAT ELSE IS IN
THE THEATER?
>> IT'S MOSTLY GRISTLE.
>> Jon:  WE'LL WORK ON THAT
NEXT TIME.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
>> THANK YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
>> TAKE YOUR TIME.
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW THE
HEIMLICH.
NOT THAT YOU'RE HERE, I'M JUST
SAYING IF YOU WERE HERE, I DON'T
KNOW THE HEIMLICH.
I CAN'T SEND ANYBODY TO WHEREVER
IT IS THAT YOU ARE THAT WE WOULD
SEND SOMEBODY IF YOU CHOCKED ON
THE STEAK WHERE ARE YOU
CLEARLY-- JUST ( BLEEP ) GO.
JUST GO.
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, JON, YOU REMEMBER THAT
TIME HE GROPED ANGELA MERKEL AT
THE G-8 SUMMIT.
>> Jon:  GEORGE, I REMEMBER
THAT?
>> THAT WAS A BIG EMBARRASSMENT,
RIGHT?
>> Jon:  YES.
>> IT TURNS OUT IF YOU COMIEWZ
NOT TO DO THAT, ANGELA MERKEL
HAS A FATAL PANIC ATTACK AND
DIES.
>> Jon:  SO THE-- SHEIDIZE
FROM A PANIC ATTACK.
DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN?
IS THAT EVEN A THING?
>> TELL THAT TO THE GAME, JON.
PANIC ATTACKS ARE FATAL FOR
GERMAN LADIES, AND THE ONLY WAY
IS TO SHOW THEM HOW WE RELAX IN
"HEY GIRL."
THERE'S A DECISION POINTS ROOM
AT THE CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL
LIBRARY GLI DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST A
CROTCH-LEVEL HOLE IN THE WALL.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  SO THEN YOU-- YOU
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO... TO
PUT YOUR--
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT-- I GET IT
NOW.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH, AL.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING
HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WE'LL BE RIGHT
