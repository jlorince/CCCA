>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT! MYGUEST, A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME
OF STEPHEN JOHNSON, HE IS AUTHOROF "HOW WE GOT TO NOW,"
IT'S A VERY TIMELY BOOK BECAUSE-- IT IS NOW.
BREAKING NEWS TODAY!
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDERIS STEPPING DOWN AFTER NEARLY
SIX YEARS ON THE JOB.
>> ERIC HAS AGREED TO STAY ON ASATTORNEY GENERAL UNTIL I
NOMINATE A SUCCESSOR, AND THATSUCCESSOR IS CONFIRMED BY THE
SENATE.
>> Jon: SO HE WILL NEVERLEAVE!
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS
CONGRESS SLOW TO ACT ON ANYIMPORTANT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS
CURRENTLY, THEY'RE BUSY (BLEEP)THEIR PANTS.
>> I.S.I.S. IS A THREAT.
>> THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TOHIT US HERE AT HOME.
>> THEY HAVE KILLED THOUSANDS,THEY ARE MARCHING ON.
>> WE CAN'T BURY OUR HEADS INTHE SANDS ON THIS.
>> ACTION MUST BE TAKEN.
>> THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISETO THE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL
GET KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME.
>> Jon: ALL OF US KILLED! ALL OFUS.
WE'LL BE THE DEAD AS THE ART OFHOW TO PROPERLY SQUIRE A LADY AT
A COTILLION!
(LAUGHTER)ALWAYS BRING AN EXTRA PAIR OF
GLOVES!
FRUIT PUNCH CAN SPILL!
(LAUGHTER)SO IF YOU'RE FACING AN
EXISTENTIAL THREAT URGING THEPRESIDENT TO ACT, BUT I WAS
UNDER THE IMPRESSION CONGRESSCOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS,
LIKE DECLARE WAR.
>> IF CONGRESS IS SUCH ANEQUAL PARTNER AS IT IS,
WHY NOT WRITE A RESOLUTION OFYOUR OWN.
>> TYPICALLY IN MY TIME HERE INCONGRESS, THAT'S NOT HOW THIS
HAS HAPPENED. THE PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES WOULD REQUEST
THAT SUPPORT AND WOULD SUPPLYTHE WORDING OF A RESOLUTION TO
AUTHORIZE THIS FORCE.
AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME, WE'VENOT GOTTEN THAT REQUEST, WE'VE
NOT SEEN THAT LANGUAGE.
>> Jon: WE WOULD LOVE TO HELPSTOP THE GREATEST THREAT THIS
COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN -- BUTNOT IF IT MEANS WE'RE GOING
TO BE RUDE. WE'RE NOTGOING TO BE RUDE.
THAT WOULD BE GAUCHE.
BUT AT LEAST CONGRESS CAN AGREEON ONE THING --
I'M JUST KIDDING. THEY CAN'T.
(LAUGHTER)>> THE PRESIDENT HAS THE
AUTHORITY HE NEEDS NOW TO ACTAGAINST I.S.I.S.
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME TOCONGRESS AND ASK FOR
AUTHORIZATION.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS THEAUTHORITY TO IMMEDIATELY ACT.
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HASTO COME TO CONGRESS.
>> I BELIEVE HE HAS THEAUTHORITY TO MOVE ON IT.
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BESEEKING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL,
PERIOD.
>> Jon: IT'S SO HEARTENING TOSEE CONGRESS USUALLY SO GRID
LOCKED ALONG PARTISAN LINESFINALLY REACHING ACROSS THE
AISLE AND COMING TOGETHER TOGET NOTHING DONE.
(LAUGHTER)OR IS THERE SOMETHING
ELSE GOING ON HERE?
>> I THINK AT SOME POINT INTIME, WHEN WE COME BACK, AFTER
THE ELECTIONS, I THINK THEREWILL BE A CONSIDERATION OF A
LARGER AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USEOF FORCE.
>> Jon: AFTER THE MIDTERMS.
WE'LL DO IT AFTER THE MIDTERMS!
WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THECOUNTRY'S EXISTENTIAL THREAT
UNTIL CONGRESS DEALS WITH ITSEXISTENTIAL THREAT.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS ANINCREDIBLY COMPLICATED
CONSTITUTIONAL CONUNDRUMWHICH JAMES MADISON IN
FEDERALIST #51 REFERREDTO AS A TOTAL PIG (BLEEP).
WHICH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT HASTHE POWER TO TO TAKE US TO WAR?
IS THIS EVEN A WAR AT ALL? ANDIF IT ISN'T A WAR, WHAT IS IT?
NOW IS THE TIME FOR AN ADULTCONVERSATION ABOUT HOW OUR
GOVERNMENT MAKES ITS MOSTIMPORTANT DECISIONS AND
FUNCTIONS IN CRISIS. AND TO LEADTHAT DISCUSSION
I GIVE YOU OUR NATIONAL MEDIA.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SO-CALLEDLATE SALUTE.
>> HOLDING A CUP IN HIS RIGHTHAND.
>> THE GREAT COFFEE ESCAPADE.
>> COFFEEGATE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HOT WATER.

>> HASHTAG LATTE SALUTE.
>> THE COFFEE SALUTE WENT VIRAL.
>> THE LATTE IS BLOWING UPONLINE.
>> Jon: WE ARE SO (BLEEP). IDON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO.
(LAUGHTER)FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE CURRENTLY
FIGHTING, IF I MAY SAY,SO APPARENTLY WE'RE CURRENTLY
FIGHTING I.S.I.S. AND EBOLA,TWO THINGS THAT ARE LITERALLY
BLOWING UP AND GOING VIRAL.SO, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
COVER THE IMPORTANT STUFF, ATLEAST DON'T USE WORDS THAT
REMIND US OF THE IMPORTANTSTUFF YOU'RE NOT COVERING.
OK, NOW TO BE FAIR, LATTE GATEWASN'T ALL THE NEWS TALKED
ABOUT YESTERDAY. BUT WHERE IMIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE PRESIDENT'S
SALUTE WITH COFFEE CUP ANESPRESSO-SIZED SHOT OF
ATTENTION, THE NEWS CHANNELSWENT FOR THE FULL DOUBLE VENTI
COVERAGE WITH ONE NETWORK GOINGESPECIALLY DEEP.
>> LEARN THE PROPER RESPECT OFTHE SALUTE.
>> IT'S INSENSITIVE.
>> WHAT'S THE MEANING OF IT?THAT'S IT.
>> IT LOOKS TERRIBLE.
>> IT'S OUTLANDISH, AND IT'SDISAPPOINTING.
>> PUT YOUR COFFEE IN THE OTHERHAND.
>> OUR COMMANDER INCHIEF DISPLAYED HIS COMPLETE
DISRESPECT FOR THE MEN ANDWOMEN IN UNIFORM --
>> Jon: SHUT UP! YOU DON'TREALLY CARE!
YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUTTHIS!
YOU HAVE NO PRINCIPLE ABOUTTHIS.
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SCOREPOINTS IN A GAME THAT NOBODY
ELSE IS PLAYING. HERE'S HOW WEKNOW.
>> IT'S AN ARROGANCE THAT HEPORTRAYS.
THESE PEOPLE HAVE PUT THEY'RELIVES ON THE LINE.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> SHOW THE RESPECT, SALUTETHESE GUYS.
>> Jon: SO THE PRINCIPLE HERE ISSHOW RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THELINE FOR THIS FIGHT.
HERE'S ERIC BOLLING ON THAT VERYSAME EPISODE.
>> THE FIRST FEMALE PILOTPILOTING FOR THE U.A.E. DROPPED
THE BOMBS ON I.S.I.S. ONMONDAY NIGHT.
>> WOULD THAT BE CONSIDEREDBOOBS ON THE GROUND? OR NO?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, FORGET
THE RAMPANT SEXISM IN THATSTATEMENT. SECOND OF ALL,
SHE'S A PILOT, SO WHATEVERGENDER SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT SHE
MIGHT BE CARRYING IS IN THE(BLEEP) AIR. AND THIRDLY,
WHAT WAS THE QUOTE THAT SOMEONESAID EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM?
THESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THEIRLIVES ON THE LINE FOR US, SHOW
RESPECT.
SO (BLEEP) YOU AND ALL YOURFALSE PATRIOTISM.
WHEN BUSH TOOK US TO WAR, ANYCRITICISM WAS SHOUTED DOWN AS
TREASONOUS. WHEN BUSH TOOK US TOWAR, ANY CRITICISM WAS SHOUTED
DOWN AS TREASONOUS. BUT THEPRESIDENT YOU DON'T LIKE, HAS
THE COUNTRY POISED ON THE SAMEPRECIPICE, NO TRANSGRESSION NO
MATTER HOW IMMATERIAL ORRIDICULOUS IS TOO SMALL TO CITE
AS EVIDENCE THAT THIS PRESIDENTISN'T AS AMERICAN AS YOU ARE.
YOU WANT A HOT CUP OF COGNITIVEDISSONANCE, WATCH THIS.
>> WOULD PRESIDENT BUSHEVER DO THAT?
>> YEAH ARE WE SURPRISED? IMEAN, AFTER ALL WE'VE GOT A
CHAI SWILLING, GOLF-PLAYING,BASKETBALL, TRASH-TALKING
LEADING-FROM-BEHIND,I-GOT-NO-STRATEGY, OSAMA BIN
LADEN-IS-DEAD, GM IS ALIVE,COMMUNITY ORGANIZING
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, HOWDISRESPECTFUL WAS THAT?
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH NOW WHILEPALIN IN A BALD CAP WAS FEEDING
US A STEAMING BOWL OF LIBERALEPITHETS, HE DRINKS CHAI SO
THAT MEANS WHEN HE SUCKS(BLEEP) IN THE BACK OF A
VOLVO IT HAS THAT CARDAMOMZING. BUT IN THEIR HASTE, THEY
FORGOT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,WOULD PRESIDENT BUSH EVER SALUTE
THE TROOPS WITH A CUP OF COFFEEIN HIS HAND? AND THE ANSWER IS
NO, BECAUSE HIS HANDS WERE TOOFILLED WITH DOG, A SCOTTY, OUT
OF RESPECT. (APPLAUSE)
SO HERE WE'VE GOT TWO PRESIDENTSBOTH SENDING
THE UNITED STATES TO WAR, CITINGTHE SAME LEGAL AUTHORITIES, BOTH
WITHOUT ANY SEEMING EXITSTRATEGY, AND BOTH HOLDING
(BLEEP) IN THEIR HANDS WHILESALUTING TROOPS, BUT IN THEIR
DISEASED MINDS, ONLY ONE DID ITBECAUSE HE LOVED AMERICA, THE
OTHER DID IT BECAUSE HE HATEDIT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
