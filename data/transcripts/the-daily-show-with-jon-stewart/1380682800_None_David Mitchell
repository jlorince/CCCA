>> Jon: MY GUESTTONIGHT, BEST SELLING AUTHOR,
HIS BOOKS INCLUDE CLOUD ATLASHE'S HERE TO TALK ABOUT A BOOK
HE TRANSLATED ANDWROTE THE INTRODUCTION FOR, IT
IS CALLED THE REASON I JUMP.
THE INNER VOICE OF A13-YEAR-OLD BOY WITH AUTISM BY
NAOKI HIGASHIDA, PLEASE WELCOMETO THE SHOW DAVID MITCHELL.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
BEING HERE.
>> IT IS A PLEASURE.
>> Jon: AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOURBOOKS AND I DO LOVE YOUR BOOKS
-->> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: -- THIS, THE REASON IJUMP IS ONE OF THE MOST
REMARKABLE BOOKS I THINK I HAVEEVER READ.
IT IS TRULY MOVING, EYE OPENING,INCREDIBLY VIVID, HOW DID YOU
BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS?
>> WELL, BRIEFLY, MY WIFE AND IHAVE A BOY WITH AUTISM.
SHE HAPPENS TO BE FROM JAPANAND SOME YEARS AGO, THREE OR
FOUR YEARS AGO, SHE WAS LOOKINGTHROUGH A WELL-KNOWN ONLINE
RETAILER, AND SHE FOUND AREFERENCE TO THIS.
SO WE HAD THE DIAGNOSIS OFAUTISM FOR OUR SON BUT WE
DIDN'T, STILL DIDN'T KNOW MUCHABOUT IT.
SO SHE ORDERED THE BOOK, READIT, STARTED READING SECTIONS OF
IT FOR ME, IN THE END SHE WASREADING THE WHOLE BOOK, AND
IT REALLY SORT OFALTERED HOW WE VIEWED OUR OWN
SON'S AUTISM AND HOW TO RELATEWITH HIM
AND WHAT HIS POTENTIAL COULD BE.
WE STARTED TO DO AN UNDERGROUNDTRANSLATION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
LOOKED AFTER OUR SON AND THEN MYAGENT GOT TO HEAR ABOUT IT AND
HERE WE ARE.
THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS YOUNGBOY'S UNDERSTANDING OF HIS
PROCESS EXPLODES SO MANY MYTHSABOUT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM.
>> YES, WE FEEL SO -- OF COURSE,AS YOU KNOW, YOU DO SOME
FUNDRAISING WORK FOR AUTISMYOURSELF, YOU ARE AWARE OF HOW
MANY PRESENTATIONS OF AUTISMTHERE ARE, AND IT MAKES MORE
SENSE TO TALK ABOUT AUTISMS,THAN IT DOES ABOUT AUTISM.
FOR NAOKI, HE HAS HAD A LUCKYGENETIC HAND THAT HIS AUTISM,
WHILE HE COULDN'T HAVE THISCONVERSATION FOR EXAMPLE, HE
WOULD BE TOO AUTISTIC FOR THAT,HE IS ABLE TO TYPE, AND BECAUSE
OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE WHAT MENTALELOQUENCE CAN EXIST BEHIND THIS
WALL OF SPEECHLESSNESS WHICH ISA PRETTY COMMON MANIFESTATION OF
MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM.
>> AND THAT IS THE VIEW, I THINKTHERE IS A TENDENCY YOU CAN VIEW
A CHILD OR A GROWNUP WITH THISAS BROKEN.
THEY ARE BROKEN.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND YET WHEN YOU SEETHEIR LIFE AND THEIR INNER LIFE
IS AS COMPLEX AS NUANCED, ITSTRUCK ME, I SPENT THE SUMMER IN
JORDAN AND EVERYONE SPOKE ARABICBUT ME AND IT WAS VERY ISOLATING
AND I COULDN'T SPEAK THELANGUAGE, AND OBVIOUSLY I WAS
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WELL ENOUGHTO GET WHAT I NEEDED AND THEY
UNDERSTOOD WHERE I WAS COMINGFROM, BUT I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY
THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVEAUTISM OR THE SYNDROME ARE NOT
-- DON'T WANT TO BE ISOLATED,THEIR CONDITION ISOLATES THEM.
>> YES.
I THINK OFTEN SYMPTOMS AND CAUSECAN GET MIXED, IT IS A
MYSTERIOUS CONDITION.
ESSENTIALLY, WE WILL ONLYUNDERSTAND
AUTISM WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THEBRAIN, AND WE ARE ABOUT TWO OR
THREE EINSTEINS AWAY FROM THAT,HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THAT THEY ARE
BROKEN, IT IS THEIR MEANS OFCOMMUNICATING, WHAT IS GOING ON
IN THEIR MIND, THAT IS BROKEN.
AND WITH LUCK ANDWITH HELP YOU CAN WORK ON THAT,
AND HELP THEM TO EXPRESSTHEMSELVES.
>> Jon: WHAT WAS THE MOSTHEARTBREAKING PARTS TO READ ARE
THE PARTS WHERE THIS CHILD ISVERY AWARE OF THE STRESS THAT
THE CONDITION IS CAUSING ON HISCAREGIVERS AND ON HIS PARENTS
AND THE PEOPLE, AND HIS LOWSELF-WORTH BASED ON NOT BEING
ABLE TO CONTROL THESE THINGS,THAT HE KNOWS YOU WANT HIM TO
CONTROL.
>> YES.
AND WHEN WE WERE TRANSLATINGTHAT, I JUST WANTED TO TELL HIM
-- YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRYABOUT WITH YOUR AUTISM, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT ME.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.
BUT HE DOES, AND THAT'S ONE MORETHING THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM,
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TODO.
I MEAN, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, ON-- THAT IS ALMOST THE DEFINING
FACET OF AUTISM, THAT THEY AREINCAPABLE OF EMPATHIZING AND
INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HOWOTHER PEOPLE MIGHT BE FEELING.
BUT HE CERTAINLY CAN, AND MANY,MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE MORE
ABLE TO EMPATHIZE THAN WE GIVETHEM CREDIT FOR.
>> Jon: ALMOST THE ANTITHESIS,IT IS SO RAW FOR HIM THAT HE
ALMOST CAN'T BEAR TODISAPPOINT
IN THAT REGARD.
>> YES.
YES.
TO WHAT DEGREE THIS IS AUTISM,TO
WHAT DEGREE A 13-YEAR-OLDJAPANESE KID WHO DOESN'T WANT TO
LET PEOPLE DOWN FOR REASONS, ITIS MYSTERIOUS AND WHERE AUTISM
BEGINS AND PERSONALITY STARTS.
IT IS A VERY HAZY AREA, BUT THEBOOK WAS SO HELPFUL FOR ME IN
RELATING TO MY SON, AND IT ISNOT THAT UNUSUAL.
MANY PEOPLE WHO -->> Jon: IT IS THE MOST
ILLUMINATING BOOK I THINK I HAVEEVER READ ON THE SYNDROME AND ON
-- AND ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND ITALLOWS YOU TO SEE SOMEONE WITH
THE SYNDROME AS AN INDIVIDUAL,AND THAT IT IS NOT A SYNDROME.
>> IT COMPLETELY RUINS THEVOCABULARY.
>> Jon: WILL YOU HANG AROUNDFOR A LATE BIT.
I DON'T NORMALLY URGE YOU -- THEREASON I JUMP IS ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW,PLEASE IF YOU HAVE
A CHANCE, PICK IT UP,IT IS REMARKABLE.
DAVID MITCHELL.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
