BECAUSE THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT FOOD OR KIDS.
IT'S ABOUT BIG GOVERNMENT UBER THANNY MICHELLE OBAMA WHO IF SHE SAID WE FEED CLEAN AIR HALF THE COUNTRY
WOULD DEMAND GILLS BECAUSE FREEDOM!
LISTEN THE COMPLAINT.
>> THE USDA SHOULDN'T BE DECIDING HOW MANY CALORIES WE TAKE OR HOW MANY CALORIES WE EXPEND DURING THE DAY.
AT SOME POINT IT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: THIS IS AMERICA, JACK.
JUST BECAUSE UNCLE SAM IS BUYING ME LUNCH DOESN'T MEAN HE REQUEST TELL ME WHAT TO EAT-- HE CAN TELL ME WHAT TO EAT.

>> Jon: RIGHT, BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA, JACK!
IF UNCLE SAM IS PAYING FOR THE MEAL, UNCLE SAM GETS TO TELL WHERE YOU TO EAT.

I JUST FORGOT, I DON'T MAKE ANY [BLEEP] SENSE!
THE STORY ACTUALLY CAME TO LIGHT BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF A FINI PARODY MUSIC VIDEO MADE BY SOME HIGH-SCHOOL
STUDENTS THAT EVEN INCLUDED SOME MUCH YOUNGER STUDENTS SINGING ALONG IN KANSAS WHERE THEY DECRIED THE NEW
FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND EVEN BURNED THE LEGISLATION.
KIDS TAKING A STRONG POLITICAL STAND.
PRETTY SOPHISTICATED STUFF.
>> THE PARODY SCHOOL WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY AN ENGLISH TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

>> Jon: OH, A TEACHER WROTE A SONG THAT THE CHILDREN INCLUDING WHAT APPEAR TO BE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLKIDS
PERFORMED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
I WONDER HOW FOX IS GOING TO TAKE THIS.
I DON'T MEAN THEIR PUNDITS, I MEAN THEIR NEWS PEOPLE.
>> CAFETERIA REVOLT, THE NEW SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM THAT HAS LEFT STUDENTS STARVING.
>> IN KANSAS SOME KIDS AND A TEACHER CAME UP WITH A PARODY, A VIDEO TURNING THE SONG WE ARE YOUNG INTO WE
ARE HUNGRY.
>> I'M TOLD THAT IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEIR VEGETABLES YOU JUST SERVE IT TO THEM DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AND
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL MAKE THEM LOVE THEIR VEGETABLES.
>> Jon: IT'S ALL JUST GOOD FUN THIS IS A FUNNY LITTLE VIDEO, PARODY INDIVIDUAL YOG, KIDS AT SCHOOL T REMINDED ME
OF THAT VIDEO OF KIDS SINGING A SONG ABOUT BARACK OBAMA JUST AFTER HE WAS INAUGURATED.
>> WE ARE TRYING TO GET SOME ANSWERS ABOUT A VIDEO THAT IS GETTING ATTENTION ON THE DRUDGE REPORT WEB SITE THIS MORNING.
IT SHOWS YOUNG CHILDREN SINGING THE PRAISES, QUITE LITERALLY OF THE PRESIDENT.
MANY PARENTS HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS.
MANY PARENT WAS.
AND JUST DON'T WANT THIS SORT OF POLITICAL CHEERLEADING, IF YOU WILL, IN THE CLASSROOM.
>> Jon: HMMMM, THE TONE SEEMS DIFFERENT IN THOSE TWO STORIES.
SO KIDS SINGING A SONG CRITICIZING THE ADMINISTRATION, IT IS JUST FUNNY.
KIDS SINGING A SONG PRAISING THE ADMINISTRATION, WE'LL SHOW IT TO YOU.

SO HOW DIVIDE READY WE AS A NATION.
WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF DIABETES AND IF OBAMA IS AGAINST THEM, WELL, AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE NEWS NETWORK IS
