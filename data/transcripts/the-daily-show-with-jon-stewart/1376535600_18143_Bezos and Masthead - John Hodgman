NEWSPAPERS THAN PEOPLE BUYING
NEWSPAPERS.
FOR MORE ON THIS WE TURN TO OUR
DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN
HODGEMAN.
JOHN?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
JOHN, I HAVE A QUESTION.
WHY WOULD, JOHN, WHY WOULD JEFF
BEZOS WANT A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER?
IS HE BORED?
IS HE TRYING TO BUILD A LEGACY?
>> A LEGACY?
WHAT GREATER LEGACY COULD THERE
BE THAN CONVINCING AMERICANS TO
SUBSCRIBE TO TOILET PAPER?
NO, I'LL TELL YOU . JEFF BEZOS
BOUGHT THE "WASHINGTON POST."
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A POOPY-HEAD.
WITH POOP IN HIS HEAD.
>> John: THAT SOUNDS PERSONAL
AND EXTREMELY JUVENILE.
>> I KNOW, JOHN, BUT JEFF BEZOS
HAS BEEN ONE-UPPING ME MY ENTIRE
CAREER.
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THE
ACQUISITION OF MY OWN D.C.
NEWSPAPER.
>> John: WHICH ONE?
IT'S A MAJOR NEWSPAPER.
WHY?
>> John: THE WASHINGTON TIMES?
IT'S THE WASHINGTON COUPON
CLIPPER PENNY SAVER.
BUT SOON TO RELAUNCH AS THE
"WASHINGTON POSTIER" COUPON
SUPER PENNY SAVER.
I CAN'T LOSE THOSE COUPON
CLIPPERS.
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO BUY
PRINT NUCHS ANYMORE SNON HOW
MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THAT?
>> $900 MILLION.
John: WHAT?
IT WAS GOING TO BE MORE BUT I
HAD A COUPON.
>> John: IS IS THIS A GOOD IDEA,
JOHN?
NEWSPAPERS HAVE NOTORIOUSLY
BECOME MONEY-LOSING BUSINESSES.
>> I'M GOING TO DISRUPT THE
PARADIGM.
THAT'S BILLIONAIRE SPEAK FOR
[BLEEP] [BLEEP].
YOU SEE, NEWSPAPERS THOUGHT THAT
PEOPLE WANT TO PAY MONEY FOR
INFORMATION.
BUT WE NOW KNOW FROM THE
INTERNET THAT WHAT THEY REALLY
WANT IS IS THEIR OWN OPINIONS
FED BACK TO TO THEM FOR FREE.
MY NEWSPAPERS WILL BE PRINTED IN
THREE EDITIONS TO CATER TO THE
LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE AND CAD
VIDEO ENTHUSIASTS.
>> John: THAT IS A POWERFUL
GROUP.
>> 40% OF OUR ECONOMY, JOHN.
NOW, LOOK AT JEFF BEZOS' RAG
FROM THIS MORNING.
OBAMA PUSHES INTERNET PROPOSAL.
(SNORING) FACTUAL, BORING.
BUT MY READERS WITH THE SAME
STORY WILL HAVE THEIR CHOICE OF
THREE PERSONALIZED HEADLINES.
FIRST, OBAMA EMPOWERS PROCEED
LEE TEAR YAT WITH WI-FI.
OR BLACK HITLER WASTES TAX PAYER
MONEY... AGAIN.
OR OBAMA CAN HAVE INTERNET?
>> John: I HAVE TO JUMP IN HERE,
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK, I AM NO EXPERT IN
BUSINESS.
>> AS YOUR SHABBY SCREAMS TO MY
TERRIFIED EYES.
>> John: BUT WON'T PRINTING'S
THREE EDITIONS OF PAPER TRIPLE
YOUR COSTS.
>> YES, JOHN, BUT I'LL MAKE UP
FOR IT BY DOUBLE-TRIPLING MY
ADVERTISING.
>> John: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE,
HODGMAN?
NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING HAS FALLEN
50% IN THE LAST DECADE.
>> MY NEWSPAPER IS GOING TO TAKE
A CUE FROM CUTTING EDGE
TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS RADIO AND
REALITY TELEVISION BY USING
PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
NOW LET'S SEE HOW SCOOP BEZOS
REPORTS THE INTERNATIONAL NEWS.
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY
AFFIRMED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.
NICE WORD BEZOS.
YOU JUST MISSED A HUGE REVENUE
STREAM.
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY
AFFIRMED HIS SUPPORT FOR SYRIA'S
GOVERNMENT WHILE ENJOYING A ICE
COLD MOXIE SODA.
WHICH IT TURNS OUT IS NOT
DISGUSTING.
THAT TASTE.
>> John: NO SERIOUS NEWS OUTLET
WOULD EVER ENGAGE IN THAT KIND
OF SHAMELESS BEVERAGE.
>> HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN THE
OPENING SEQUENCE OF MORNING JOE
BREWED BY STARBUCKS.
>> John: I DO THINK MY POINT
ABOUT SERIOUS NEWS OUTLETS
STANDS.
THIS IS ALL WINDOW DRESSING,
HODGEMAN.
ARE YOU GOING TO OFFER THE
READERS ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVELY
NEW IN TERMS OF ACTUAL CONTENT?
>> OF COURSE.
EXCLUSIVE PREMIUM CONTENT.
FOR THOSE SELECTIVE READERS
WILLING TO PAY AN EXTRA FEE I
WILL ALSO SEND AN ACTUAL HUMAN
BEING THE A PLACE WHERE NEWS IS
HAPPENING.
AND THAT PERSON WILL LOOK AROUND
AND ASK QUESTIONS AND WRITE DOWN
WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> John: THAT'S JUST CALLED
BASIC REPORTING.
>> OH, REALLY?
I CALL IT HODGE'S ON PRIME.
I SAID IT, BEZOS.
COME AT ME, POOPY HEAD.
WHY DON'T YOU SUE ME IF YOU'VE
GOT THE...
>> John: OKAY.
WE'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
HERE.
THIS IS WHAT CONCERNS ME.
THE PRESS IS A VITAL PART OF ANY
DEMOCRACY.
IT SEEMS TROUBLING THAT
NEWSPAPERS SHOULD BECOME THE
IDLE PLAY THINGS OF A FEW
WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.
>> THE GREAT ROMANTIC MYTH OF
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AMERICAN
PRESS.
THAT WHISKEY-FLAVORED BOMB ON
THE LIVER OF THE INEVITABLY
DIVORCED NEWSPAPERMAN.
THE TRUTH IS, JOHN, THE NEWS
GAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE HOBBY
OF A FEW RICH MEN.
TED TURNER, RUPERT MURDOCH.
ALL THE WAY BACK TO WILLIAM
RANDOLPH HURST.
>> WILLIAM RANDOLPH HURST
STARTED THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR
JUST TO SELL PAPERS.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO
THAT ERA?
>> YES.
I'M A DERANGED MILLIONAIRE.
OF COURSE I DO.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE FIRST COPY
OF TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER.
HOT OFF THE PRESSES.
>> John: YOU ARE NOT SERIOUSLY
GOING TO RUN WITH THAT HEADLINE,
ARE YOU?
>> NOT THE CAT LOVERS' EDITION,
OF COURSE.
>> John: THANK YOU, JOHN.
JOHN HODGEMAN, EVERYONE.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
