>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
AS WE'VE HEARD, THE KEYSTONEPIPELINE GETS ANOTHER CHANCE
ONCE CONGRESS COMESBACK IN JANUARY.
BUT THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE FACESONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT HURDLE.
>> IN THE CASE OF THE KEYSTONEPIPELINE ITS BUILDER TRANSCANADA
IS USING THE POWER OF EMINENTDOMAIN TO TAKE HUNDREDS OF MILES
OF PRIVATE LAND FROM PRIVATEOWNERS.
>> Jon: EMINENT DOMAIN WHENTHE GOVERNMENT FORCES PRIVATE
LAND OWNERS TO SELL THEIRPROPERTY BECAUSE
IT'S NEEDED FOR PUBLIC USE.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED EMINEMDOMAIN, EMPOWERING EMINEM TO
TAKE YOUR PROPERTY HE DISSESYOU IN A RAP BATTLE.
PALMS WEAK. MOM'S SPAGHETTI.ALL RIGHT.
THE POINT IS, I DON'T KNOW THELYRICS.
THE POINT IS, THE COMPANY THATWANTS TO BUILD A PIPELINE
THROUGH THE UNITED STATES NEEDSMORE THAN JUST CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL. IT ALSO NEEDSSIGN-OFFS FROM THE INDIVIDUALS
WHO OWN THE LAND THAT THEPIPELINE WOULD CUT ACROSS.
I MEAN, TRANSCANADA CAN'T JUSTLAY PIPE ANYWHERE IT WANTS TO
WITHOUT PERMISSION.
IT'S NOT BILL COSBY.
IT CAN'T JUST GO ... AND BESIDESIT'S GOING TO BE A REPUBLICAN
CONGRESS. AND EVERYONEKNOWS HOW REPUBLICANS FEEL ABOUT
EMINENT DOMAIN. LIKE BACK IN2005 AFTER THAT LANDMARK
SUPREME COURT CASEKELO VERSUS NEW LONDON.
YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT.
WHICH RULED THE GOVERNMENT COULDTAKE PRIVATE LAND AND GIVE IT TO
A CORPORATION IF DOING SO MIGHTHELP THE ECONOMY.
>> THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAINSHOULD NOT BE USED SIMPLY TO
FURTHER PRIVATE ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT.
>> THERE'S HARDLY A CLEARERPRINCIPLE IN ALL THE
CONSTITUTION THAN THE RIGHT OFPRIVATE PROPERTY.
SO MUCH FOR THE CONSTITUTIONALGUARANTEE THAT YOUR PROPERTY CAN
ONLY BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE,NOT PRIVATE USE.
>> Jon:  SEE, BUT THIS ISDIFFERENT.
CLEARLY THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE ISNOT PRIVATE USE.
IT'S PUBLIC USE.
ANYBODY IN AMERICA COULD DRIVETHEIR TAR SAND OIL UP TO CANADA
AND SHIP IT BACK DOWN THATPIPELINE.
WHETHER IT BE TRANSCANADA THEPRIVATE CORPORATION THAT BUILT
IT OR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WITHAN EXCESS OF TAR SAND OIL.
[LAUGHTER]AND YOU KNOW HOW REPUBLICANS
FELT WHEN THE GOVERNMENTTRIED TO SET ASIDE LAND
FOR ALLEGED PUBLIC GOODOF CONSERVING LAND.
>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THREEMILLION ACRES, AND DEEM IT
UNTOUCHABLE FOR FURTHER ENERGYFOR THIS COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO STEP ALL OVERPRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THIS
NATION.
>> Jon: GOD KNOWS THIS COUNTRYWAS NOT BUILT ON
THE PRINCIPLE OF TAKINGLAND AWAY FROM ITS RIGHTFUL
AND ORIGINAL --
[LAUGHTER]WELL THAT'S DIFFERENT TOO
THOUGH.
YOU DON'T WANT TO USE EMINENTDOMAIN TO CONSERVE LAND, AND
IT'S CLEAR KEYSTONE PIPELINEWON'T BE DOING THAT.
I WONDER HOW PROPONENTS OF THEKEYSTONE PIPELINE WHO HATE
EMINENT DOMAIN WOULD SQUARETHOSE CIRCLES?
>> I AM DISTURBED ABOUT EMINENTDOMAIN ABUSE BECAUSE I THINK
PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AREFUNDAMENTAL TO WHO WE ARE AS
AMERICANS.
>> Jon:  GO ON.
>> THE U.S. SUPREME COURT SAIDWRONGLY I THINK THAT THE
GOVERNMENT COULD DO IT TOHELP OUT PRIVATE INTERESTS.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BEHELPING OUT PRIVATE INTERESTS.
>> Jon:  OF COURSE NOT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH EVERYTHINGYOU BELIEVE AND THE SANCTITY OF
PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THECONSTITUTION ITSELF, THE PROBLEM
WITH THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE THENIS EMINENT DOMAIN.
>> THE PROBLEM WITH THE KEYSTONEPIPELINE ISN'T THE ISSUE OF
EMINENT DOMAIN.
THE PROBLEM IS THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION WITH THE STROKE
OF A PEN SHUT THAT PROJECT DOWN.
>> Jon:  WHAT THE [BLEEP][LAUGHTER]
HOW DID YOU GET ... YES, THEPROBLEM ISN'T THE PROJECT I WANT
UNDERMINING A CONSTITUTIONALPRINCIPLE I SUPPOSEDLY SUPPORT.
IT'S THE PRESIDENT USING HISCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VETO.
THE PROBLEM IS THE CONSTITUTION.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, IT'S ALL GOING TO BE A
MOOT POINT BECAUSE NINE MONTHSAGO THE REPUBLICAN-LED HOUSE
PASSED THE PRIVATE PROPERTYRIGHTS PROTECTION ACT TO
PROHIBIT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTFROM EXERCISING ITS POWER OF
EMINENT DOMAIN FORECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
SO GUESS WHAT?
DONE AND DONE.
THAT LAW PASSES, THERE'S NO WAYTRANSCANADA CAN USE EMINENT
DOMAIN TO BUILD THEIR PIPELINE.
>> I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT MEASURESTO LIMIT EMINENT DOMAIN BUT I
STRONGLY OPPOSE AN EXEMPTION FORTRANSCANADA, KEYSTONE XL AND ANY
OTHER ENTITY THAT CANNOTPROVIDE PROOF THEIR PROJECT ARE
FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT.
>> Jon:  OH RIGHT.
UNLESS THE PRIVATE PROPERTYPROTECTION FREEDOM FIGHTERS
HAPPEN TO INCLUDE A SMALLDISCLAIMER IN THEIR EMINENT
DOMAIN IS EVIL LAW THAT STATESTHAT IT, QUOTE, SHALL NOT APPLY
TO ANY PROJECT FOR WHICHCONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS HAVE
BEEN INITIATED PRIOR TO THEDATE OF ENACTMENT.
IN OTHER WORDS, ANY PROJECTSALREADY IN THE
MOTHER [BLEEP]PIPELINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
