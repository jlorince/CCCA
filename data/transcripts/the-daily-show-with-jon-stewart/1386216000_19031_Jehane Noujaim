THE WHOLE CREW MET IN THE SQUAREAND SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE FILMING.
>> Jon: HOW DID THIS COMEABOUT?
>> I WENT DOWN AS A PROTESTERJUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID,
MET MY ENTIRE CREW IN THESQUARE, MET THE CHARACTERS IN
THE SQUARE.
WE WERE SLEEPING NEXT TO EACHOTHER IN TENTS.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE ORIGINALUPRISING AGAINST MUBARAK, NOT
THE MOST RECENT ONE.
>> THIS WAS STARTING IN JANUARY2011.
I LANDED IN EGYPT, GOTTENARRESTED 20 MINUTES
AFTER LANDING AT THE AIRPORTBECAUSE THEY FOUND AN OLD FILM I
DID CALLED "EGYPT WE'RE WATCHINGIT."
NOT THE BEST FILM TO BE FOUND BYMILITARY INTELLIGENCE.
>> Jon: DO YOU TRAVEL WITH ALLYOUR FILMS IN THE BAG?
>> I WAS HANDING OUT THE DVDS TOPEOPLE IN THE MOVIE.
THAT'S WHY IT WAS IN THE BAG.
THEY LET ME GO AFTER EIGHTHOURS.
AFTER I TRIED TO GET RID OF IT.
THEY FOUND IT IN THE DRAIN.
THEY HELD UP THE CHARD OF GLASSAS EVIDENCE.
I CONFESSED ALL.
THEY FINALLY LET ME GO AND WENTTO THE SQUARE.
IT WAS MAGICAL, MEN, WOMEN, ALLDIFFERENT CLASSES, MOST OF THEM
CHRISTIANS BASICALLY FIGHTINGFOR A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
>> Jon: IT WAS AMAZING TO SEEIN THE EARLY DAYS, TOO, MUSLIM
BROTHERHOOD AND SECULARISTS ANDSO CALLED LIBERALS, SO CALLED
CONSERVATIVES, PEOPLE OF ALLDIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSUASIONS
FORMING A VERY COMMON BOND ANDETHOS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
WE GREW UP IN AN EGYPT WHEREUNDER EMERGENCY LAW YOU CAN'T
HAVE MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVEPEOPLE MEETING AND TALKING ABOUT
POLITICS.
IT WAS UNHEARD OF.
AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
>> Jon: THIS WAS FOR 30 YEARSPEOPLE LIVED UNDER THIS REGIME
OF MUBARAK.

>> Jon: THE PEOPLE SPOKE ANDYOU REALIZE LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE
GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER REVOLUTIONTHERE.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
>> WE WENT BACK.
IT HAPPENED AS WE WERE ON THEWAY TO SUNDANCE.
PEOPLE WERE THERE SAYING MORSIIS USING THE TOOLS OF DEMOCRACY
TO CREATE ANOTHER DICTATORSHIP.
WE COULDN'T END THE STORY THEREBECAUSE IT WAS CONTINUING.
AS IT CONTINUES TODAY.
PEOPLE ARE STILL ON THE STREETSFIGHTING.
PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN THROWN INJAIL AGAIN.
WE BASICALLY GO BACK.
CONTINUE FILMING, REEDIT THEFILM AND OPEN IT IN TORONTO.

TOGETHER, NOW THE DIVISIONSBEGIN TO CLEAVE AGAIN AND YOU

BECAUSE IT LOOKS AT THEFRIENDSHIPS THAT STAY TOGETHER
DESPITE THE POLITICAL DIVIDE.

BLOODIEST BATTLE, YOU NEVER SEETHE MARTIN LUTHER KING OR THE
GANDHI WHEN THEY'VE LOSTEVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY LEFT
THEM AND THEY ARE ALONE ANDLONELY.
