>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
I'M EXCITED.
MR. CLINT EASTWOOD IS GOING TO
BE HERE.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU.
CLINT EASTWOOD WILL BE HERE.
WE'LL SWAP STORIES ABOUT BEING
ICONIC BAD ASSES OR AT LEAST
ONE OF US.
THEN I'LL JUST SIT THERE AND
GO, YOU'RE SWELL.
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AN AWFUL
LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS VIEW
MITT ROMNEY AS THE GREAT WHITE
NOTE AND HAVE THEREFORE
STRUGGLED DESPERATELY FOR
VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO MITT
ROMNEY EVEN GOING SO FAR TO
PRETEND IT MIGHT BE MICHELE
BACHMANN.
RECENTLY HERMAN CAIN EMERGED
AS THE LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO
THE SCHNOOK OF MORMON.
TODAY SHARON BIALEK ACCUSED
CAIN OF OFFERING HER A JOB IN
RETURN FOR ORAL SEX BACK IN
THE '90s.
A SERIOUS CHARGE SOMEWHAT
UNDERCUT BY HER UNFORTUNATELY
CHOSEN LAWYER AND LOCATION,
THE FRIAR'S CLUB.
>> SHE REACHED OUT TO MR. CAIN
FOR HELP IN FINDING ANOTHER
JOB.
INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THE HELP
SHE HAD HOPED FOR, MR. CAIN
INSTEAD DECIDED TO PROVIDE HER
WITH HIS IDEA OF A STIMULUS
PACKAGE.
>> Jon: NO, NO.
THEN HE ASKED HER IF SHE
WANTED TO OCCUPY BALL STREET.
OH, DOCTOR.
NOW THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR CAIN
WHO IS ALREADY TRYING TO MOVE
ON FROM THE SCANDAL OVER THE
WEEKEND AS YOU SEE IN THIS
HILARIOUSLY EYE RONIC VIDEO.
>> MR. CAIN, ONE OF THE WOMEN
WHO FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT
COMPLAINT....
>> DON'T EVEN GO THERE.
>> CAN I ASK MY QUESTION?
>> NO.
THE FACT THAT THESE WOMEN DO
WANT TO....
>> WHAT DID I SAY?
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT....
>> EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT PART OF NO DON'T SOME
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND?
>> Jon: I BELIEVE WHAT HERMAN
CAIN IS SAYING IS NO MEANS NO.
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO SAY.
YOU'RE GOING TO GO, OH, LOOK
AT THAT.
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY LOOK AT
HERMAN CAIN.
LOOK AT HOW HERMAN CAIN IS
DRESSED WITH THAT SUIT
SURROUNDED BY ALL THOSE
MICROPHONES.
HE'S ASKING FOR IT.
IT, OF COURSE, BEING
HEIGHTENED MEDIA SCRUTINY.
CAIN HAD HAD SOME SUCCESS IN
CONTROLLING THE DAMAGE BY
GOING ALL OUT AGAINST THE
MEDIA.
>> THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE
IN THE MEDIA THAT ARE
DOWNRIGHT DISHONEST.
NOT ALL BUT TOO MANY OF THEM.
IF THERE IS A JOURNALISTIC
STANDARD, A LOT OF THEM DON'T
FOLLOW IT.
AND AS A RESULT TOO MANY
PEOPLE GET MISINFORMATION AND
DISINFORMATION.
>> Jon: PEOPLE WHO GET
DIRECTIONS TO A CIRCUMSTANCE
SITUATION GET BRIS-INFORMATION.
PEOPLE WHO GET JEAN SIMMONS
TOUR DATES GET KISS-INFORMATION.
THE ACID CONTENT OF YOUR
BLADDER IS WELL, I THINK YOU
GET THE IDEA.
BUT, SEE, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
