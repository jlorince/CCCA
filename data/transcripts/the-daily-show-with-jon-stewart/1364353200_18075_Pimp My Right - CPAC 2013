THAT HAS SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO THE OVERALL HEALTH OF MINORITIES.
ALL RIGHT SO.
NOW WE KNOW.
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN APPLY THIS NEW REMESSAGING STRATEGY TO LAST WEEK'S OTHER MAJOR NEWS FROM THE
RIGHT:  CPAC WHICH STANDS FOR (bleep) PENIS AND (bleep).
NO, SORRY THAT'S --
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S ON CRAIGSLIST THAT'S WHAT IT STANDS FOR.
I BELIEVE IN THIS CONTEXT IT STANDS FOR CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION CONFERENCE.
IT'S NOT THE IDEAS BUT THE WAY THEY ARE SAYING THEM.
>> WHY AREN'T WE LETTING PEOPLE IN FROM EUROPE?
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: TALKING ABOUT EUROPE.
WHY NOT LET PEOPLE IN FROM EUROPE?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUALITY IMMIGRANTS NOT THESE SPANISH SPEAKING PRICKS YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?
THE WHITE ONES FROM SPAIN.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAPAS AND TACOS.
CLASS, YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO ELSE NEEDS A MESSAGE MASSAGE.
>> A NEW BOOK IS OUT TALKING ABOUT THE PERKS IN EXCESS OF THE $1.4 BILLION A YEAR PRESIDENCY
WE'RE PAYING FOR.
THERE ARE FIVE CHEFS ON AIR FORCE ONE.
THERE ARE TWO PROJECTISTS WHO OPERATE THE WHITE HOUSE MOVIE THEATER.
WE'RE ALSO THE ONES WHO ARE PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO WALK THE PRESIDENT'S DOG.
>> Jon: THEY MAKES A GOOD POINT THAT IS A SHARP INDICTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S WASTEFUL LIFESTYLE.
>> CONGRESSWOMAN BACHMANN GOT HER INFORMATION FROM A BOOK FROM A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN LOBBYIST.
THE BOOK PROVIDES NO SPECIFIC SOURCES FOR THE CLAIMS IT MAKES.
>> Jon: HERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY.
RATHER THAN SEEMING LIKE ON OUT TOUCH PA INFORMATION FROM DUBIOUS SOURCES GRACIOUSLY ADMIT YOUR WRONG
ASSERTIONS AND GET SOME CREDIBILITY BACK.
OR R UUUN.
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DOG WALKER WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
>> THE BIG POINT OF SPEECH WAS ABOUT BENGHAZI.
>> BUT YOU ALSO MADE ACCUSATIONS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT SPENDING MONEY THAT OTHER PRESIDENTS ALSO MADE.
>> Jon: MUST KEEP RUNNING.
FACT CHECKING UP TO ME.
MUST OUTRUN FACTS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LISTEN -- SETTLE DOWN.
WHAT IS NEXT?
>> IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK AT CPAC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: SURE Y NOT.
>> NO BACKGROUND CHECKS.
I LIKE THE IDEA, MR. PRESIDENT, SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITH YOURS.
>> Jon: I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHERE SARAH PALIN CAME FROM, SOMEONE CAST A SPELL
ON A YOUTUBE COMMENT AND IT CAME TO LIFE.
DOESN'T THE G.O.P. HAVE SOMEONE WITH IDEAS WORTH MESSAGING?
THEY NEED A FRESH VOICE, THAT CAN BE THE FACE OF A DIVERSE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> IS SPAIN'S NEUROSURGEON DR.
BEN CARSON THE BLACK CONSERVATIVE WHO CAN SAVE THE G.O.P.
>> A REMARKABLE HUMAN BEING, A GIFTED NEUROSURGEON, A WONDERFUL LIFE STORY, TREMENDOUS VALUES,
LOVES AMERICA.
>> Jon: ALL THAT AND HE'S A DOCTOR?
HERE WE GO.
YOUR PARTY IS SO SCREWED UP IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITERAL BRAIN SURGEON TO HELP FIGURE IT OUT
PHYSICAL IT IS IN FACT THE WAY YOUR MESSAGE IS FRAMED THAT THAT IS THE PROBLEM, YOU CANNOT FIND
A MORE APPEALING DELIVERY SYSTEM THAN THIS MAN.
LET'S DO THIS.
>> THAT HAS BEEN THE NATURE OF AMERICANS.
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN GENEROUS.
NOBODY --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOBODY IS STARVING ON THE STREETS.
WE'VE ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF THEM.
>> Jon: GOOD LUCK IN 2020.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
