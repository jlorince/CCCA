(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A NICE SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
TONIGHT ON THE PROGRAM WE HAVE A
YOUNG COMEDIC ACTOR, WILLIS
FERRELL.
(LAUGHTER)
YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S GOING TO BE
JOINING US, I HEAR GREAT THINGS.
REALLY EXCITED TO MEET HIM.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE
SOUTH.
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THOSE ALONG
THE MISSISSIPPI WHO ARE
SUFFERING NOT JUST FROM A
CATASTROPHIC FLOOD OF WATER BUT
ALSO FROM A MONSOON OF MEDIA ONE
UPMANSHIP.
(LAUGHTER)
THE DEBILITATING COVERAGE BEGAN
AS THE WATERS ROSE UP TO SWALLOW
ONE REPORTER'S FEET, CREEPING UP
TO THE KNEE, MOVING SLOWLY UP TO
THE THIGH, CONSUMING THE HIPS
AND FINALLY, THANK GOD, CRESTING
AT THE NIPPLE!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THE WATER CRESTED AT THE NIPPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL THESE REPORTERS BRAVELY
WADED INTO THE SURGING
MISSISSIPPI TO GIVE US
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW HIGH THE
FLOODWATERS WERE OR THE EXTENT
OF DAMAGE.
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
DOWN THING THERE BRINGING
ATTENTION TO THE STORY BUT YOU
COULD HAVE DONE THE EXACT SAME
STORIES ON DRY LAND WITHOUT EVER
GOING IN...
(LAUGHTER).
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.
YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A NEW
MEASURE OF FLOOD HEIGHT
MEASUREMENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
A WEATHERMAN-BASED SYSTEM.
>> TO GIVE YOU A SENSE, WE HERE
IN THE MISSISSIPPI.
THIS IS A PLAYGROUND.
>> Jon: (AS OLD MAN)
I REMEMBER THE FLOOD OF AUGHT 11
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
THAT WATER WAS FOUR ROKER
BELLIES HIGH.
(LAUGHTER)
