>> Jon: THERE WE GO!
WELCOME BACK!
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SO, I WILL OCCASIONALLY WATCH
THE NEWS --(LAUGHTER)
IT APPEARS, BY WATCHING IT, THATTHERE'S BEEN A DISINTEGRATION OF
THE WORLD ORDER, OF WHATEVERSORT OF STRUCTURES HAD BEEN
BUILT UP OVER THE LAST 20 OR 30YEARS.
IS THAT YOUR SENSE OF IT AS WELLOR IS IT AN EXAGGERATED SENSE OF
SOMETHING SPIRALING OUT OFCONTROL?
>> WELL, THERE IS ADISINTEGRATION, TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT, BUT IT'S EXAGGERATED INTHE SENSE THAT ALL THE NEWS IS
BAD, BUT THAT'S THE HEADLINES.
THE TRENDLINES ARE MORE GOODTHAN BAD.
AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN.
THE EXPLOSION IN INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY AND OTHER FACTORS
HAVE MADE POWER MORE DIFFUSE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE CAN GIVECELL PHONES TO FISHERMEN IN
INDONESIA IN THE AFTERMATH OFTHE TSUNAMI, AND THEIR INCOME
GOES UP 30% BECAUSE FOR THEFIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY
KNOW WHAT THE REAL PRICE OF FISHIS.
THE BAD NEWS IS THE SAMETECHNOLOGY CAN GO TO I.S.I.S.
AND THEY CAN BECOME A DROID ONTHE SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU SEE TWO AUSTRIANTEENAGE GIRLS PICKED UP AT THE
AIRPORT TRYING TO GO THERE ANDBLOW PEOPLE UP FOR THEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO POWER IS MORE DIFFUSE, ANDYOU'VE GOT TO BE, THEREFORE,
MORE INCLUSIVE TO EXERCISE IT.
SO THE REASON I THINK THAT THEPRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO COMBAT
I.S.I.S. HAS A CHANCE TO SUCCEEDIS THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT
FINALLY INCLUDES SUNNIS WHOWERE REPRESENTING THOSE TRIBAL
LEADERS WHO ARE MODERATE ANDWITHOUT WHOM I.S.I.S. CANNOT BE
DEFEATED. I MEAN,WE CAN GIVE THEM INTELLIGENCE
AND WE CAN DO BOMBING AND WE
HAVE TO DO THAT TO SEND A SIGNALTO THEM THAT THERE'S A PRICE FOR
DECAPITATING THOSE TWO PEOPLE.
>> Jon: MM-HMM.
>> YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE GET AWAYWITH THAT, THAT'S A TERRIBLE
SIGNAL TO THE WORLD. BUT WECAN'T WIN A LAND WAR IN IRAQ.
WE PROVED THAT.
BUT THEY CAN ANDWE CAN HELP THEM WIN IT.
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE WHAT WE'RETRYING TO DO. SO, IF YOU WANT
TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT THATWORKS THAT'S EFFECTIVE, IT HAS
TO BE INCLUSIVE, OTHERWISE, ORIT CAN BE AUTHORITARIAN AND JUST
GET RID OF EVERYBODY THEYDISAGREE WITH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, THERE'S BASICALLY THREEMODELS GRIPPING THE WORLD.
THERE'S THE ENTREPRENEURIALNON-GOVERNMENTAL MODEL WHICH IS
GREAT IF IT'S THE GATESFOUNDATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NOT SO GREAT IFIT'S I.S.I.S.
>> OR WHAT WE TRY TO DO. ANDTERRIBLE IF IT'S I.S.I.S.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> THERE'S THE AUTHORITARIANISM
CAPITALISM MODEL WHICH IS RUSSIAAND IN A
DIFFERENT WAY CHINA AND HAS SOMEAPPEAL LIKE THE HUNGARIAN PRIME
MINISTER, THEY OWE A LOT TOAMERICA, HE JUST SAYS HE LIKED
AUTHORITARIAN CAPITALISM, BUTHE'S JUST SAYING I DON'T WANT TO
EVER LEAVE POWER.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> USUALLY THOSE GUYS JUST WANTTO STAY FOREVER AND MAKE MONEY.
BUT, AND THEN THERE'S THEDEMOCRACY MODEL.
IF THE DEMOCRACY MODEL IS GOINGTO WORK, IT HAS TO BE INCLUSIVE.
THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY WORKSIN THE MODERN WORLD IS
COOPERATION AND GETTINGDIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE
TOGETHER, BRINGING THEIR SKILLSTOGETHER.
THAT'S WHY THE CLINTON GLOBALINITIATIVE HELPED 400 MILLION
PEOPLE IN 180 COUNTRIES BECAUSEWE HAVE THESE NETWORKS OF
COOPERATION AND THEY JUST GROWAND GROW.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: DOES THE UNITED STATESTHOUGH,
DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE TOREADJUST IT'S MODEL THEN
FOR PROJECTING POWER IN THIS NEWMORE INCLUSIVE WORLD?
DO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT A LESSSTRENUOUS VERSION OF A
PROJECTION OF AMERICAN POWER ANDALSO ACCEPT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
PERFECT? YOU CAN'TERADICATE IDEOLOGIES BECAUSE
THINGS LIKE 9/11 WERE PLANNEDIN A THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENT
IN MUNICH. YOU CAN'T...
>> WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACTTHAT WE MAY NOT WIN EVERY
BATTLE.
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THATWE BASICALLY ARE IN WHAT IS
PROBABLY -- WE'RE PROBABLY ABOUTHALFWAY THROUGH SINCE THE END OF
THE COLD WAR.
A 50-YEAR STRUGGLE TO DEFINE THETERMS OF OUR INTER-DEPENDENCE.
BUT WE KNOW WE AREINTER- DEPENDENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> THAT IS,
ALL THE BORDERS OF THE WORLDLOOK MORE LIKE NETS THAN WALLS.
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THISBORDER PROBLEM WE HAD RECENTLY
WITH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN KIDSSHOWING UP.
THEY MOSTLY WERE RUNNING AWAYFROM GANG VIOLENCE AND
NARCOTRAFFICKERS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT WE ACTUALLYHAVE FAR FEWER ILLEGALS CROSSING
THIS BORDER NOW THAN WHEN I WASPRESIDENT AND THE ECONOMY WAS
BOOMING AND WE HAD TO BUILD UPTHE DEFENSES THERE.
WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT DOING NEARLYAS BAD AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE WE
CONFUSE THE HEADLINES WITH THETRENDLINES.
EXTREME POVERTY IS DOWN.
MATERNAL MORTALITY IS DOWN.
KIDS ARE LIVING LONGER.
>> Jon: MIDDLE CLASS IS RISINGAROUND THE WORLD, JUST NOT HERE.
>> YES. WELL, THAT'S A DIFFERENTSTORY.
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A DIFFERENTSTRATEGY IN AMERICA.
BUT THE EXTREME POVERTY HASDROPPED DRAMATICALLY AROUND THE
WORLD.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IN TINY RWANDA, THEGOVERNMENT CREATED ALL THESE NEW
VILLAGES SO THAT PEOPLE WOULDHAVE DECENT HOUSING AND CREATED
STALLS FOR MILK COWS AND PLACESTO STORE THE MILK TO KEEP IT
FROM BEING DESTROYED.
THAT ONE THING, GIVING A MILKCOW TO EVERY RURAL FAMILY TOOK
670,000 PEOPLE OUT OF EXTREMEPOVERTY...
>> Jon: WOW.
>> INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEGLOBAL MIDDLE CLASS.
SO WE CAN DO THESE THINGS, BUTWE'VE GOT TO HAVE PATIENCE AND
WE CAN'T BE ARROGANT AND WE'VEGOT TO REALIZE INCLUSION WORKS
AND UNILATERALISM DOESN'T.
>> Jon: RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT --YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME FIVE OR TEN
MORE MINUTES, AREN'T YOU?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A NICEMAN.
WE'LL BE BACK ON THE WEB.
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
