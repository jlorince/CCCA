(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK,
MY GUEST TONIGHT THENATIONAL POLITICAL
CORRESPONDENT FOR YAHOO!NEWS, HIS NEW BOOK CALLED
"ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT, THEWEEK POLITICS WENT TABLOID."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM MATT BAI.
MATT!
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, THANKYOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THIS IS "ALL THE TRUTH ISOUT.
THE WEEK POLITICS WENTTABLOID."
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SO THISCONCERNS GARY HART RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT IN 1987.
>> 1987.
>> AND I WAS ALIVE THEN.
I WAS AN OLD MAN THEN,EVEN THEN.
BUT IN REREADING, IN GOING ITOVER, I HAVE MISREMEMBERED
ALMOST THE ENTIRE AFFAIR.
>> YES.
>> AND IS THAT SOMETHING THATYOU FOUND THE GARY HART
AFFAIR HAS ITS OWN SORT OFLEGEND AND THAT MUCH OF IT
IS NOT TRUE?
>> YES. YES, ARE YOU NOTALONE.
BASICALLY EVERYTHING PEOPLEREMEMBER ABOUT THIS, IF THEY
REMEMBER IT AT ALL, IS NOTTRUE.
EVERYBODY THINKS THERE WAS APICTURE OF THE WOMAN DONNA
RICE ON HIS LAP AND THATDROVE HIM OUT OF THE RACE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> IN FACT --
>> Jon: AND THE T-SHIRT THATSAYS, WHAT IS IT,
MONKEY BUSINESS.>> MONKEY BUSINESS.
>> Jon: YEAH.>> IN FACT,
IT DIDN'T DRIVE HIM OUT OFTHE RACE IT WAS THREE WEEKS
AFTER THE RACE AND IT WASN'TTAKEN ON A BOAT, IT WAS TAKEN
ON A DOCK WITH HUNDREDS OFPEOPLE MILLING AROUND.
AND THE BIGGEST THING I THINKPEOPLE MISREMEMBER,
IS EVERYBODY THINKS HE SAIDFOLLOW ME AROUND.
AND-- .
>> Jon: RIGHT, HE CHALLENGEDREPORTERS, YOU THINK I'VE
GOT A PROBLEM.
FOLLOW ME AROUND, I WILLPROVE I DON'T.
>> RIGHT, THE REALITY IS HEDID SAY THAT TO A SINGLE
REPORTER, BUT IT WAS NOTPUBLIC OR KNOWN TO ANYONE AT
THE TIME WHEN THE "MIAMIHERALD" SENT A BUNCH OF
REPORTERS TO GO PUT HIM UNDERSURVEILLANCE AT HIS TOWN HOUSE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT, ASYOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS
IS THAT THE BOUNDARIESWEREN'T ACTUALLY REWRITTEN
BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLICLIVES BECAUSE GARY HART SAID
LET'S REWRITE THEM. ITACTUALLY WAS A MEDIA
DECISION, IT WAS A DECISION MYINDUSTRY MADE.
AND HERE YOU HAVE THE PRESUMEDNOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY, HE'S THE HILLRY CLINTONOF HIS DAY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WAY AHEAD IN THE POLLS.
PINNED UP AGAINST A BRICKWALL ON THE SIDE OF HIS
TOWNHOUSE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THEY CHASED HIMOUT OF THE BACK DOOR OF HIS
HAT, YES? -- OF, OF HIS HOUSE.
>> YEAH, YEAH, WEARING A WHITEHOODIE.
AND THEY'RE PEPPERING HIM WITHQUESTIONS ABOUT WHO IS THE
WOMAN IN YOUR HOUSE, HAVEYOU HAD SEX WITH THAT WOMAN,
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENEDBEFORE.
IN THAT ALLEY, I THINK THERULES OF POLITICS AND
POLITICAL JOURNALISM CHANGEDFOREVER.
IT'S A GRIPPING STORY.
>> Jon: THE IDEA TOO THAT,YOU KNOW, IN THIS DAY AND
AGE PEOPLE CATCH THINGS ONCELL PHONES AND THINGS.
THIS WAS SET UP SURVEILLANCE.
>> YES.
>> Jon: TO CATCH A GUY BASEDON AN ANONYMOUS TIP.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT HAD COME IN,THAT HE WAS HAVING A
DALLIANCE.
AND PART OF THE ISSUE IS,WHEN DID THAT BECOME FODDER
FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
BECAUSE CERTAINLY KENNEDY,CERTAINLY JOHNSON, CERTAINLY
MANY OF THE POLITICIANS THATHAVE RUN THIS COUNTRY AND WE
IDOLIZED, HAD ISSUES LIKETHIS.
>> RIGHT.
WELL, CHARACTER WAS ALWAYS APART OF POLITICS.
AND SOMETIMES SEX BECAME APART OF POLITICS.
THE MEDIA DID NOT GO LOOKINGFOR IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND NO ONE WAS SORT OFCOMPLETELY DEFINED AND
DISGRACED IN THE WAY QUITETHAT HE WAS BEFORE.
AND THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON, ASYOU MENTIONED THE SATELLITE
DISH.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU HAD THIS GENERATIONCOMING INTO JOURNALISM AFTER
WATERGATE THATS HAD WOODWARDAND BERNSTEIN IN THEIR MINDS
AND ALSO WHAT THEY SEE AS THEMORAL FAILURES OF NIXON AND
THAT THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED.
SO YOU HAVE A LOT THAT ISCHANGING WITH HIM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND IN THAT CAULDRON,HART SORT OF WALKS INTO IT.
I MEAN, IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
I THINK IT WAS INEVITABLE. IDON'T THINK THE "MIAMI HERALD"
DID THIS, I DON'TTHINK GARY HART DID THIS.
I THINK SOMEBODY HAD TO WALKINTO IT.
>> Jon: IF IT WASN'T GARYHART, IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE
ELSE.
>> ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
BUT WAS HIM AND I THINK THATMOMENT TELLS US A LOT OF HOW
WE GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE WEARE WHERE OUR POLITICS
FEEL SO STERILEAND OUR POLITICIANS SO
REMOTE AND OURJOURNALISM, OFTEN...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO NOT ILLUMINATINGFOR THE THINGS THAT MATTER.
>> Jon: SO AT THIS POINT, THEGENERAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS
ARE POLITICIANS BECOMEINCREDIBLY CAUTIOUS.
THEY DON'T-- IT BECOMES NOWABOUT REALLY SCRIPTING A
CAMPAIGN IN A WAY THAT DIDNOT EXIST PRIOR TO THAT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> DID NIXON DID NOT DO THAT,KENNEDY -- I MEAN, THEY MUST
HAVE ALL HAD SPIN TEAMS BUT WERETHEY MORE, WERE THEY LESS
GUARDED WITH THE PRESS THANTHEY ARE NOW?
>> MUCH MORE SO.
MUCH MORE SO.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND YOU KNOW, YOU SEE IT, INTHAT MOMENT, JUST AFTER THAT
STAKEOUT, RIGHT, THEY GO TO NEWHAMPSHIRE AND THERE IS THIS
FAMOUS NEWS CONFERENCE WHERETHE REPORTER FROM "THE
WASHINGTON POST" PAUL TAYLORSAYS IN FRONT OF A CROWDED ROOM
OF PRESS SAYS TO HART, SENATOR,HAVE YOU EVER COMMITTED
ADULTERY.
NO CANDIDATE WAS EVER ASKEDTHAT KIND OF BLANKET QUESTION.
>> Jon: AND DO YOU THINK IT'SBECAUSE IT'S, IT'S EASIER,
IT'S MORE SALACIOUS, IT SELLSMORE PAPERS THAN TRYING TO FIND
OUT THE MORAL FABRIC OF ANINDIVIDUAL WITH REAL VIRTUES
THAT MATTER IN GOVERNANCE?
>> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLYAFTER RICHARD NIXON THERE
WAS A LEGITIMATE AND GENUINEFEELING THAT PERSONAL
MORALITY MATTERED MORE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT CHARACTER HAD ACTUALLYDONE HIM IN AND DONE THE
COUNTRY IN MORE THANPOLICY.
AND SO THERE WAS A, THERE WAS AREASONABLE IMPULSE THERE.
BUT I THINK MOSTLY WE HAVEVEERED AND BEGAN TO VEER IN
THAT MOMENT INTO THE REALMOF ENTERTAINMENT.
INTO THE IDEA THAT CAMPAIGNSAND POLITICS HAD TO UNFOLD
LIKE STORY ARCS, HAD TO HAVECHARACTERS, HAD TO HAVE PLOT
TWISTS.>> Jon: A DRAMATIC NARRATIVE.
>> WE HAD TO HAVE, SUDDENLY WEHAD THESE SATELLITE DISHES AND
YOU COULD GO LIVE FROM ANYWHEREAT ANY POINT.
AND YOU HAD TO HAVESOMETHING TO GO LIVE WITH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND REMEMBER THAT SAMEYEAR IS THE JIM BAKER AND
TAMMY'S FAYE BAKER SCANDAL.>> Jon: YES.
>> WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE HAD AGREAT TIME WITH.
>> Jon: OH YES.
>> WITH THE MASCARA STREAKEDFACE AND ALL THAT.
>> Jon: SO MUCH MAKEUP.
>> AND FAWN HALL AND OLVERNORTH.
>> Jon: FAWN HALL, RIGHT. THEYWENT ON A JAG.
>> ALL THE SAME YEAR.
>> THEY WENT ON ACRAZY -- YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> YEAH>> Jon: THAT WAS --
>> SO YOU CAN SEE THAT MOMENTCOMING --
>> Jon: AND I DIDN'TREALIZE, I DIDN'T REMEMBER HART
WENT BACK INTO THE RACE.
>> YES, HE DOES.
>> Jon: HE WENT BACK IN.
>> YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S THEDECISION I THINK HE REALLY
REGRETTED.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IS HE SORT OF WALKED AWAY ANDHE SAID THIS IS NOBODY'S
BUSINESS, AND THISIS NO WAY TO RUN A
CAMPAIGN AND I'M NOT GONNAPUT PEOPLE THROUGH THIS.
>> Jon: AND THEN HE JUMPED BACKIN.
>> HE CAME BACK IN IT WENT VERY,VERY POORLY.
HE REGISTERED 0 PERCENT INIOWA WHICH IS NOT IDEAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: RIGHT. THAT IS TRUE.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE,BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT
POLITICS IS COVERED NOW, DOYOU BELIEVE WE HAVE LOST OUT
ON TRULY GREAT AND POSSIBLYGREAT LEADERS BECAUSE OF THE
WAY THAT WE COVER THEM?
ARE THERE, AND THIS ISOBVIOUSLY A HYPOTHETICAL,
BUT DO YOU THINK THERE AREPEOPLE OF SUBSTANCE WHO
COULD HAVE DONE THIS COUNTRYGREAT THINGS, WHO WE WILL
JUST NEVER KNOW ABOUTBECAUSE OF THE CORROSIVE
NATURE OF OUR POLITICS?
>> I DO, JON.
I HAVE BEEN COVERINGNATIONAL POLITICS FOR 15 YEARS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND HAVE COVERED FOURPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS.
I DO THINK WE LOSE PEOPLEWHO DON'T WANT TO PUT
THEMSELVES THROUGH THISUNENDUREABLE PROCESS,
OR THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH IT.
I THINK WE DRUM GOOD PEOPLEOUT OF POLITICS WHO ARE
DEFINED BY THE SINGLE WORSTTHING THEY HAVE EVER DONE AS
OPPOSED TO THE CONTEXT OFTHEIR PUBLIC LIVES AND I THINK
WE MAKE IT MUCH MUCH EASIERFOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO
BUSINESS HOLDING OFFICE TOENTER THE PROCESS.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE NOTTALKING ABOUT IDEAS AND
WORLDVIEWS AND AGENDA.
WHEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUTCHARACTER AND PERSONALITY,
IT MAKES IT VERY EASY FORSOMEONE TO FLOAT THROUGH THE
PROCESS WITHOUT EVER HAVINGTO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES OR
DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY KNOW.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: THAT WAS AWESOME.
YOU SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN. THATWHOLE THING YOU JUST SAID.
>> I THINK I DID.
>> Jon: "ALL THE TRUTH ISOUT."
IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW,MATT BAI.
>> THANK YOU.
