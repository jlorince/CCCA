COMEDY CENTRAL
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THIS IS... THIS TONIGHT WILL BE
A GOOD EPISODE OF OUR PROGRAM.
HOW GOOD?
FORMER THREE-TERM WISCONSIN
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD GOOD.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FEINGOLD, JERRY, FEINGOLD.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN NEW JERSEY
WHERE I WAS VERY PROUD LAST
FRIDAY TO SAY THAT THE STATE
LEGISLATURE, THE STATE WHERE I
GREW UP VOTED TO LEGALIZE GAY
MARRIAGE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE MOST EVENTS
IN NEW JERSEY, IT WAS
IMMEDIATELY THROWN OFF COURSE BY
A LOUD ITALIAN GUY.
>> A BILL LEGALIZING SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE APPROVED BY THE NEW
JERSEY LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN
VETOED BY CHRISTIE.
>> I BELIEVE THAT THE
INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE AS IT'S
TRADITIONALLY KNOWN IS BETWEEN
ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN AND THAT
IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY IN NEW
JERSEY.
(BOOS).
>> Jon: IN N NEW JERSEY...
HEY, PIPE IT DOWN!
(LAUGHTER)
IN NEW JERSEY WE BELIEVE
MARRIAGE SHOULD BE AS IT ALWAYS
WAS INTENDED BETWEEN ONE
INDICTED ORANGE-FACED MAN AND A
WOMAN WITH HIGH BANGS AND DEAD
EYES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CHRIS CHRISTIE... HOW YOU DOING?
HOW YOU DOING?
NICE TO SEE YOU?

MARRIAGE EQUALITY.
SPECIFICALLY, THE EQUALITY PART.
IT'S SURPRISING SINCE HE, TOO,
IS A MEMBER OF A GROUP SOCIETY
DOES NOT ALWAYS GRANT A FULL
MEASURE OF RESPECT.
I'M REFERRING, OF COURSE, TO
CHRISTIE'S CHOICE TO LIVE OPENLY
AS AN OBESE AMERICAN.
(LAUGHTER)
I WONDER WHAT HIS POSITION WOULD
BE ON THIS MARRIAGE QUESTION IF
THE NATIONAL DISCUSSION WENT
THUSLY.
>> I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF FAT
MARRIAGE.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REDEFINE
MARRIAGE.
FAT MARRIAGE IS WRONG.
WE FOUGHT HARD AND PREVENTED
MASSACHUSETTS FROM BECOMING THE
LAS VEGAS OF FAT MARRIAGE.
>> NEW YORK IS A PLACE WITH LOTS
OF FATS BUT I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF
FAT MARRIAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I MEAN HONESTLY, IT
MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS
