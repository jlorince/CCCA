>> Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
>> HE WAS A TROUBLED IMMIGRANTYOUTH WHO WAS SMOKING AND
DRINKING AND STEALING BY THETIME HE WAS 9, DIDN'T THINK HE
WAS GOING TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.
HE HAD A BROTHER PETE WHO SAIDYOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT, THE
KIND OF BROTHER WE ALL WISH WEHAD.
HE ENDED UP RUNNING IN THE 19 INHITLER'S OLYMPICS.
HITLER ASKED TO SHAKE HIS HANDEVEN, BECAUSE HE HAD THE FASTEST
LAST LAP. ENDED UP AS ABOMBARDIER WHEN HE WAS DRAFTED.

47 DAYS AT SEA.
MANY PRISON CAMPS LATER, FACEDMUCH ADVERSITY AND AT THE END OF
THE DAY HIS STORY IS ABOUTOVERCOMING ADVERSITY AND FINDING
YOURSELF AND THE STRENGTH INSIDEYOURSELF. IS THAT GOOD?
>> Jon: SO, THAT'S THE FIRSTACT. THE FIRST ACT.
THE SECOND ACT -->> HOW DID I DO?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: OKAY.
SO THEN IT REALLY STARTS TO HEATUP WHEN HE MEETS SANDRA BULLOCK.
(LAUGHTER)SO HE LEAVES.
WAS IT FOR YOU A CHALLENGE, YOUKNOW, YOU'VE CERTAINLY ACTED IN
YOUR SHARE OF THESE TYPES OFLARGER, YOU KNOW, MORE EPIC TYPE
OF FILMS, BUT TO BE AT THE HELMOF IT, WAS THAT THE BIG
CHALLENGE?
HAD YOU BEEN AROUND IT ENOUGH TOUNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO
CHALLENGE YOURSELF FOR THAT?
OR DID IT TAKE YOU OFF GUARD?
>> IT TOOK ME OFF GUARD.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> DIDN'T IT TAKE YOU OFF GUARD?
>> Jon: STILL IS.
>> IT DID.
I REMEMBER WAKING UP IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BEFORE A
SHARK ATTACK AND THINKING, IDON'T KNOW HOW TO FILM A SHARK
ATTACK.
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE LOOKINGAT ME TOMORROW TO TRY TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO DO THIS SHARK ATTACK--
>> Jon: NOW ARE THERE ACTUALSHARKS IN THERE?
>> HOW DO YOU, HOW DO YOU EVEN-- NO, I CAN'T SAY.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T SAY IF THEYWERE ACTUAL SHARKS?

CG SHARKS. BUT THESETHINGS, YOU REALIZE YOU CAN
YOU CONVINCE THE STUDIO, YOUSAY, YOU SHOULD GIVE ME THIS
JOB, YOU KNOW. GIVE ME THIS JOB.I'LL BE THE BEST PERSON AT THIS
JOB. I KNOW EXACTLY WHATI'M DOING.
>> Jon: YEAH.>> I'M SO SURE OF IT.
AND THEN YOU GET THE JOB ANDTHEN YOU THINK, OH, MY!
I'M NOT SURE I DO.
SO EVERY DAY WAS A CHALLENGE.
BUT WE HAD A GREAT TEAM AND ITHINK WE PULLED IT OFF.
>> Jon: IS IT MORE FULFILLING?
WHICH OF YOU FOUND THAT TOUCHESYOU A LITTLE BIT DEEPER?
>> I LOVE DIRECTING. YOU KNOW,YOU'RE THERE FROM BEGINNING TO
END. YOU'RE THERE FOR YEARS OFYOUR LIFE.
AND YOU'RE SHEPHERDING FROM THEMUSIC TO THE FINAL LITTLE
TINY DETAIL OF THE SHARK INTHE WATER AND HOW IT SWIMS
AND EVERYTHING, SO IT'S AHUGE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT
YOU GET TO HAVE THAT CONTROL --
>> Jon: RIGHT. DID THAT EVERSTEM FROM -- SO, SO WHEN YOU'VE,
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON THE SETAND YOU HAVE BEEN ACTING
AND YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING, BUTBECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT
CONTROL AND YOU MIGHT SEE THEFINAL PRODUCT AND THINK, MAN,
THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD HAVEGONE, IS THAT WHERE THE DESIRE
STEMS FROM IS TO HAVE MORE OFTHAT?
>> I DIDN'T -- WELL, YOU KNOW, IDIDN'T PLAN ON BECOMING A
DIRECTOR.
I WROTE SOMETHING AND THEN IWANTED TO PROTECT IT, SO IN
ORDER TO PROTECT IT, I ENDEDUP SAYING -- I DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY ELSE TO DIRECT ITBECAUSE I WAS WORRIED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> THAT WAS THE FIRST FILM.
AND THIS, I JUST LOVE THE STORYSO MUCH AND I WANTED TO TELL IT.
>> Jon: SUCH AN AMAZING STORY.>> BUT, BUT YES. I OFTEN WITH
FILMS, THERE ARE STILL A FEWFILMS OF MINE I STILL HAVEN'T
