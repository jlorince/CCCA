>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WE ALL KNOW WHY MUSLIMS CAN'T HAVE A COMMUNITY CENTER IN LOWER MANHATTAN BUT CAN THEY HAVE CHILDREN?
WYATT CENAC HAS THE INVESTIGATION.
>> THERE ARE COUNTLESS KIDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY DESPERATELY IN NEED OF FOSTER HOMES.
WITHOUT THEM THEY'LL BE STUCK SWINGING FOREVER AND LISTENING TO HORRIBLE MUSIC.
THESE KIDS NEED VOLUNTEERS TO BECOME FOSTER PARENTS LIKE THIS WOMAN.
OH, BOY.
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S A CATHOLIC NUN OR A NINJA.
>> I APPLIED TO BE A FOSTER PARENT.
I WENT THROUGH THE BACKGROUND CHECK, THE FINGER PRINTING AND I WAS REJECTED.
LET ME GUESS IS IT -- ARE YOU UNEMPLOYED?
>> NO.
>> ARE YOU A U.S. CITIZEN?
>> YES.
>> DO YOU HAVE BAD CREDIT?
>> NO.
>> GOOD CREDIT?
>> NOPE.
THEY REJECTED ME BECAUSE I'M MUSLIM AND I DON'T ALLOW PORK IN MY HOME.
>> THAT'S RIGHT SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW CHILDREN TO EAT PORK.
FORTUNATELY THE CONTEMPORARY FAMILY SERVICES WAS SENSIBLE TO KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF HER HOUSE.
>> WE'RE DENYING YOUR APPLICATION BECAUSE OF YOUR SKPHREUSITY REQUEST TO PROHIBIT
PORK PRODUCTS WITHIN YOUR HOME ENVIRONMENT.
>> SHE WOULD DENY THEM PORK BUT WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM SERVING THEM SATANIC LEPRECHAUN WORSHIP FOOD.
CONTEMPORARY FAMILY SERVICES WOULDN'T SPEAK WITH US BUT KEEPING KIDS OUT OF PORK FREE
HOMES IS WHAT ANY OTHER AGENCY WOULD DO AS WE FOUND OUT BY SPEAKING WITH RESM -- REX SMITH.
WOULD YOU REJECT A PARENT THAT WOULDN'T SERVE PORK IN THE HOUSE?
>> NO, I'M LOOKING FOR GOOD PARENTS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY ARE MUSLIM OR JEWISH.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
>> WHAT OTHER TERRIBLE RELIGION COULD THERE BE?
>> WHAT IS A TERRIBLE RELIGION?
>> ONES THAT DON'T EAT PORK.
>> MAYBE IF YOU SPEND MORE TIME IN CHURCH.
>> I SPEND MORE TIME IN CHURCH THAN MOST PEOPLE.
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, 24-7, MY EMPLOYER IS THAT GUY OR GAL UPSTAIRS.
>> UPSTAIRS IS A CURVES GYM, I BELIEVE.
>> HER REFUSAL MADE IT CLEAR SHE WAS TOO INFLEXIBLE TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH WHAT THEY NEED.
>> WHAT KIND OF MUSLIM ARE YOU.
ARE YOU -- OR WE DIDN'T LAND ON PLYMOUTH ROCK, PLYMOUTH ROCKLANDED ON US.
>> I AS A FOSTER PATIENT WOULD RESPECT ANY CHILDREN'S RELIGION CHOICE.
IF THEY WANT TO GO TO CHURCH,
THEY CAN GO TO CHURCH.
IF THEY WANT TO GO TO A SYNAGOGUE, THEY CAN GO TO A SYNAGOGUE.
>> WHAT IF THEY WORSHIP JIMMY DEAN.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY DON'T NEED LOVE.
>> IF THEY GO TO THE CHURCH OF JIMMY DEAN, I THINK THE LOVE IS SAY NICE GROUND SAUSAGE.
WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE WELL BEING OF A CHILD?
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
WELCOME TO -- WE SAT DOWN WITH THESE FOUR PRODUCTS TO THE FOST ER CARE SYSTEM TO SEE WHAT
THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE.
WOULD THEY CHOOSE DRY RUBBED RIBS, A HONEY HAM OR A STABLE FOSTER HOME.
WHAT SITUATION WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE, A FOSTER PARENT WHO YOU COULD CONFIDE IN OR A PORK
SPHORGAS BOARD?
>> EVEN THOUGH THIS PORK IS GREAT IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD GO WITH THE FIRST ONE.
>> A FOSTER PARENT.
>> MITCHELL, A FOSTER PARENTENING A GROUP HOME.
>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE A FOSTER PARENT.
>> GYM ME NO, YOU ARE DONE.
ALL OF YOU GET OUT.
GET, GO.
IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS EVIDENCE THIS, FORMER FOSTER CHILD HERSELF COULDN'T SEE HOW HER
HOME WITH A RIGID LANDSCAPING WAS NO PLACE FOR A CHILD.
>> I FELT AS I COULD RELATE BEING IN THE SAME SITUATION AS THE CHILD.
>> WELL, I CAN SEE WHY THEY DENIED YOU.
>> THERE ARE OTHER RELIGIONS LIKE CHRISTIANS OR JEWS THAT DON'T ALLOW PORK BUT THEY GET
FOSTER CARE ALL THE TIME.
>> MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO WILLING TO BE FOSTER PARENTS THAT THEY SHAMEFULLY EAT PORK.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
>> WHATEVER THE CASE, IT'S CLEAR THE SYSTEM IS WORKING.||||
