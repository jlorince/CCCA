THE REPUBLICAN SHUT DOWN TACTICSAND POLITICS WAS
OFFENSIVE TO EVEN INDEPENDENTSAND MODERATES THAT THIS COUNTRY
LOOKS LIKE IT'S POISED TO TURNBLUER THAN A SMURF'S BALLS AFTER
DRY HUMPING A BOTTLE OF WINDEX.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A
PICTURE FOR THAT.
[LAUGHTER]ALL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO TO
GAIN LIKE AN 80% TO 20%ADVANTAGE IN THIS COUNTRY, ALL
THAT STANDS IN THEIR WAY, IS AMILDLY COMPETENT IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE HEALTH CARE POLICYTHEY BATTLED SO HARD TO KEEP.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

BUTA GLITCH IS ALL OF THEM.

>> ACCORDING TO A POLL BY THEASSOCIATED PRESS FEWER THAN ONE
IN TEN PEOPLE WHO TRIED TOSIGN UP WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO
COMPLETE THE PROCESS.
THAT'S A SUCCESS RATE OF LESSTHAN 10 %.

[ LAUGHTER ]HOW LOW IS IT?
ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL MOREOF THIS COUNTRY BELIEVES
