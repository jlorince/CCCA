MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY GUESTTONIGHT, MARK FAINARU-WADA, HE
HAS WRITTEN A BOOK THAT HASROCKED THE NFL ABOUT
CONCUSSIONS, WROTE IT WITH HISBROTHER, FABULOUS BOOK, HAPPY
HALLOWEEN. HEALTHCARE.GOV IS ONEMONTH OLD, AND LIKE
MOST ONE MONTH OLDS, IT ISJUST LYING THERE POOPING ITS
PANTS AND ANGERING ANYONE WHO IT IS NOT RELATED TO.
WELL, YESTERDAY THE HOUSE ENERGYAND COMMERCE COMMITTEE HELD THE
MUCH ANTICIPATED HEARING, WITHKATHLEEN SEBELIUS, LET'S SEE HER
TRY TO WIGGLE OUT OFACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS MESS.
>> LET ME SAY DIRECTLY TO THEAMERICANS YOU DESERVE BETTER.
I APOLOGIZE.
I AM ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU FORFIXING THESE PROBLEMS.
>> Stewart: THAT WAS WEIRD.
I WONDER IF HER APOLOGY WILL INANY WAY AFFECT ANY CERTAIN
GRANDSTANDING TYPE CONGRESSPEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE PLANNED ON
SHAMING HER INTO APOLOGIZINGWITH SOME KIND OF WEIRD PROP OR
SOMETHING.
>> I CAME WITH A QUOTE FROMAMERICAN ICON.
HOLD UP A POSTER THAT SAYS IFYOU ARE HAVING A PROBLEM, IT IS
OUR PROBLEM.
AND I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOUEMBRACE
THIS PHILOSOPHY TO YOUR ACTIONSTODAY.
>> Stewart: NOW, I AM REALLYGLAD YOU EMBRACE THIS PHILOSOPHY
EVEN THOUGH I WAITED ALL NIGHTAT KINKOS AND
I PAID PRETTY GOODMONEY FOR THIS SIGN, AND JUST A
HEADS-UP, IF YOU, I GOT THIS BIGSIGN AND IT COST A LOT OF MONEY,
THAT'S ALL.
I FELT LIKE A (BLEEP) DRIVING ITON TOP OF MY CAR.
>> POOR GUY.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU SPENTALL NIGHT PREPARING (BLEEP)
SANDWICH FOR YOURENEMIES TO EAT ONLY TO HAVE THEM
SIT DOWN AND UNWRAP THEIR OWN(BLEEP) SANDWICH.
TO EAT IN FRONT OF YOU.
SO THIS IS CONGRESS, WELL THATGUY IS STANDING WAS NOT THAT
GRAND, I AM SURE WHERE THAT CAMEFROM.

WHAT THEY PROMISED?
>> USERS WHO TRIED TO SIGN UPAND WERE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE OF
THE PROBLEMS WHAT DO YOU PLAN TOGET THOSE FOLKS TO COME BACK?
>> DID THE CONTRACTORS DELIVERTHE SYSTEM THAT YOU CONTRACTED
THEM TO BUILD?

TESTING OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM?

THOSE QUESTIONS WERE ACTUALLYQUITE GOOD FROM BOTH SIDES OF
THE AISLE.
