THE SMILING WOMAN ON THE HOME PAGE IS GONE.

[LAUGHTER]WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TODAY
[LAUGHTER]WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TODAY
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE LEG SWING SHOULD GO.
[LAUGHTER]WE'RE BORED.

TO THE SITE.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S PROMISING IT WILL BE LARGELY
PROBLEM-FREE BY THE END OF NOVEMBER.

TO BOOST CAPACITY AND ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY.
AND LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR.
THESE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE GIVEN BREAKS.
[LAUGHTER]MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE
CHILDREN.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I DO THINK -- I DO THINK -- LIKE THAT?
I DO THINK I MAY HAVE SPOTTED ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING
WHY THE HEALTHCARE.GOV SITE IS SO SLOW.
APPARENTLY THE SERVERS ARE BEINGOVERLOADED BY NEWS CASTERS FROM
EVERY SINGLE NETWORK TRYING TO LOG ON.
NO NETWORK HAS BEEN LOGGIER THANOUR PALS AT CNN THAT WANT YOU TO
KNOW THEY HAVE A CLOCK.
>> WE'RE ALMOST 13 MINUTES IN AND SHE'S BEEN LOCKED OUT TIME
AND TIME AGAIN.
>> ONE MAKING PROGRESS.
THE OTHERS GOING SLOW AND NOW SLOWER.
ONE PERSON IS REACHING OUT TO GET HELP ONLINE.
WE'LL FIND OUT HALFWAY INTO THE LIVE OBAMA CARE SIGNUP EFFORT.
SO FAR WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS, SERIOUS SET BACKS.
>> YOU MAY LIKE THE OPTIONS.
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE IN YET.
YOU LOVE THE OPTIONS.
HAPPY WITH IT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> IT'S NOT VERY STREAMLINED.
IT'S KIND OF A LOT -- IT'S A LOTTO SORT THROUGH.
>> Jon: PLUS, THERE'S CAMERAS AND A CLOCK AND YOU [BLEEP] ARE
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.
[LAUGHTER]I LOVE HOW THE ONE LADY GOES, I
LOVE THE OPTIONS.
YOU LOVE THEM?
LET'S TALK TO GABE.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY IN THE THING.
LET'S TALK TO GABE.
>> THE ONLY THING MORE DISTURBING THAN SIGNING UP FOR
HEALTHCARE.GOV IS APPARENTLY WATCHING PEOPLE TRY AND
SIGN UP FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV.
>> WE'RE WATCHING THESE PEOPLE TRYING TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMA CARE
HERE IN THE SITUATION ROOM.
>> Jon: WOW! THAT WOMAN'S REACTION, YOU THINK
PEOPLE WERE [BLEEP] IN A CUP OR SOMETHING.
THAT WAS WEIRD HOW SHE REACTED TO PEOPLE TRYING TO SIGN UP FORA WEBSITE
