BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT -- I'M SO NOSTALGIC LATELY!
LET'S TAKE A TRIP BACK IN TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
JOIN ME, WON'T YOU?
THE YEAR WAS 20-OUGHT-12.
"LINCOLN" TAUGHT AMERICA SLAVERYWAS BAD.
CARLY RAE JEPSEN SUGGESTED WECALL HER -- BUT OF COURSE, MADE
IT CLEAR WE DIDN'T NECESSARILYHAVE TO.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE REPUBLICANS TOOKAN OLD-FASHIONED ELECTORAL
CLOBBERING, WHEN THE BESTC.G.I. ARTIST AVAILABLE COULD
NOT MUSTER A LIFELIKE VERSIONOF MITT ROMNEY.
IT WAS THE WORST NEWS FORREPUBLICANS SINCE 2008, WHEN
THEY TRIED TO DEFEAT OBAMA WITHTHE WORLD'S ANGRIEST MAN AND
WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE SIXMEDIUM-CLEVER RACCOONS STACKED
LIKE A HUMAN WOMAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- NEVER TRUST RACCOONS IN A
PANTSUIT?
NO!
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: FAILUREIS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.
>> THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WE'RETRYING TO ADDRESS IS ACTUALLY
HAVING PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITYTO MAKE THE CASE TO HISPANICS
AND TO WOMEN.
>> THE PERCEPTION THAT WE'RE THEPARTY OF THE RICH,
UNFORTUNATELY, CONTINUES TOGROW.
>> FOCUS GROUPS DESCRIBED OURPARTY AS NARROW-MINDED, OUT OF
TOUCH AND, QUOTE, STUFFY OLDMEN.
>> Jon: CONTINUING...
QUOTE, SHRIVELED ANGRY MUMMIES,WRITHING, ALMOST HYPNOTIZED
UNDER A BILLIONAIRE-FUNDED MONEYSHOWER, RAINING WAR AND
DESTRUCTION THROUGHOUT THEHEMISPHERES.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S ALL.
REALLY.
SO THE SELF-DIAGNOSED PROBLEMWITH THE REPUBLICANS IN 2012
WAS YOU THEIR IMAGE, BEINGABUNCH OF RICH, OUT OF TOUCH,
OLD WHITE MEN, ALIENATINGLATINOS AND WOMEN.
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO FIXTHAT.
-- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'SCOMING NEXT.
>> DONALD TRUMP IS THE CLEARLEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PACK,
MAKE NO MISTAKE.
>> THIS POLL SHOWS 20% OFREPUBLICANS BACK DONALD TRUMP,
7% AHEAD OF HIS CLOSEST RIVALS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: YES!
THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OFEVERYTHING REPUBLICANS WERE
TRYING TO EXORCISE FROM THEIRPARTY JUST ESCALATED DOWN ON
THEIR PARADE.
>> I'M REALLY RICH.
THE TOTAL IS $8,737,540,000.
WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE,THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS, THEY'RE
BRINGING CRIME -- THEY'RERAPISTS.
SHE WANTED TO BREAST PUMP INFRONT OF ME, AND I MAY HAVE SAID
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
I MAY HAVE SAID SOMETHING ELSE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE.
SHE'S A HORRIBLE PERSON --
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HOW'S THAT OUTREACHGOING TO LATINOS AND WOMEN
AGAIN?
(LAUGHTER)
LISTEN, I'M SURE TRUMP WAS ONLYDISGUSTED ABOUT BREASTFEEDING.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HEREALIZED, WHOA, BOOBS CAN DO
THAT?
WHAT?
THAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I EVERSAW.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP IS EVEN WORRYINGTHE G.O.P.'S MOST IMPORTANT
CONSTITUENTS, THE SIX HORSEMENOF THE CASH APOCALYPSE, WHO
FINANCE CAMPAIGN REPUBLICANCAMPAIGNS, I CAN ONLY ASSUME
FROM THEIR SINISTER SUB-TERRANEAN SWAP HEADQUATERERS.
>> SOEM BIG REPUBLICAN DONORSARE GETTING WORRIED ABOUT HOW
THINGS ARE GOING IN THEREPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> THESE ARE THE INVESTORS INTHESE CANDIDACIES, AND THEY'RE
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT KIND OFDAMAGE HE MIGHT BE DOING ON THE
DEBATE STAGE.
>> Jon: THIS TRUMP GUY IS ARICH, CRAZY, EGOTISTICAL
MONSTER!
PEOPLE LIKE HIM ARE SUPPOSED TOBUY THE CANDIDATES, NOT BE THEM!
(LAUGHTER)
IN OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,ONE BRANCH HAS THE MONEY, AND
THE OTHER BRANCH DOES WHAT THEONE BRANCH WITH THE MONEY TELLS
THEM TO DO!
HE'S SCREWING THE WHOLE POOCH!
(LAUGHTER)
BUT EVEN IF THE RNC CAN'TCONTROL THE CANDIDATES... OR
THEIR MESSAGE.. OR THE VOTERS...OR THE IRRATIONAL, EMOTIONAL
DESIRES RULING THE VOTERS, THEREIS ONE THING THEY CAN CONTROL.
>> WE NEED TO CONTROL THEDEBATES, THE PARTY NEEDS TO
CONTROL THE DEBATES.
>> THE REPUBLICAN THUNDERDOME.
TOP TEN CANDIDATES FROMTHE FIVE MOST RECENT NATIONAL
POLLS WILL MAKE THE MAIN STAGE.
>> IT IS STILL ANYONE'S GUESS ASTO WHO EXACTLY WILL
TAKE THE STAGE.
>> THEY'RE TRYING DESPERATELY TOBOOST THE POLL NUMBERS.
>> SO WHO GETS A SPOT?
>> Jon: WILL IT BE YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN THAT LITERALLY. YOU.
YOU SHOULD STOP WATCHINGAND CHECK THE POLLS JUST IN CASE
ONE OF YOUR FRIEND PUT YOUR NAMEIN AS A PRANK AND YOU'RE NOW
DOING BETTER THAN LINDSEYGRAHAM.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU NEED TO START PLACING PLANETICKETS TO CLEVELAND.
SO...
THEY'RE GOING TO CHOOSE BASED ONTHE POLLS.
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN, I DON'TKNOW, THE LAST FOUR QUALIFYING
SPOTS FOR YOUR DEBATE ARE LOCKEDIN A STATISTICAL TIE WITHIN
THE MARGIN OF ERROR OF YOURPOLLS?
>> IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP TEN INTHE POLLS, YOU'RE IN. IF NOT,
YOU'RE OUT.
>> FOX, WHICH HOSTING THEDEBATE, HASN'T REVEALED
PRECISELY WHICH POLLS IT WILLUSE TO DECIDE WHO IS ON STAGE.
>> Jon: AH.
SO BASICALLY THEY'RE GOING TOLOOK AT THE POLLS AND ROGER
AILES IS GOING TO PICK WHOEVERHE WANTS.
OR, AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE TOLDME IN OUR SECRET MEETING...
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE BIG PROBLEM FOR THEREPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE THAT THEY
WANT THEIR CANDIDATES TO BECIVIL AND MORE ACCESSIBLE TO
MINORITY OUTREACH, BUT THE ONLYWAY TO GET MORE NOTICED AND
QUALIFIED FOR THE DEBATES IS TOTAKE ON THE ABSUVIE CHEET-O
DUST-FACED ELEPHANT IN THEROOM.
>> IF MY NUMBERS GO UP JUSTBECAUSE I CALL DONALD TRUMP A
JACKASS -- I MEAN, THAT'S NOTWHY I WANT TO RISE IN THE POLLS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO BEJUDGED BY MY IMPERTINENT
LANGUAGE, SPOKEN HARSHLY TO AYANKEE FINANCIER AND
SCALLYWAG!
I WANT TO BE JUDGED BY THEPURITITY OF MY LINEAGE AND MY
FAMILY'S SWEET TEA RECIPE!
AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS, THESECRET INGREDIENT IS -- SUGAR!
HOW FAR HAS TRUMP LOWERED THEDISCOURSE IN SIX WEEKS SINCE HE
CANNONBALLED IN THE RACE?
>> FOSTER FRIESS, WHO WROTEBACKED RICK SANTORUM IN 2012
WROTE TO THE 16 CANDIADTES OUTTHERE, QUOTE --
WOULD YOU JOIN THE EFFORT TOINSPIRE A MORE CIVIL WAY OF
MAKING POINTS IF THEY DRIFT OFFTHE CIVILITY RESERVATION, LET'S
DON'T IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATETHAT TO THEM --
>> Jon: THAT FROM A GUY WHONOT ONLY BACKED A CANDIDATE WITH
A NAME SYNONYMOUS WITH SOMETHINGYOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW, BUT
CONSIDERS THIS A CIVIL WAY OFDISCUSSING WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE.
>> BACK IN MY DAYS THEY USEDBAYER ASPIRIN FOR
CONTRACEPTIVES, THE GALS PUT ITBETWEEN THEIR KNEES.
>> Jon: AHHH!
WELL, JUST BE THANKFUL THAT MOSTOF THE OLDER REPUBLICAN DONORS
ONLY SHOOT COBWEBS AND DUSTPARTICALS.
SERIOUSLY, EVERY TIME HEEJACULATES, IT'S LIKE OPEN AGO
VERY OLD BOOK.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, MR. CHAIRMAN --
(APPLAUSE)
MR. CHAIRMAN, DID YOU EVERCONSIDER THAT MAYBE THE G.O.P.'S
PROBLEM ISN'T HOSTILEMODERATORS OR A LIBERAL MEDIA OR
TOO MANY DEBATES OR NOT ENOUGHSPANISH LANGUAGE LEAFLETS?
MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS REGISTEREDREPUBLICANS IN THEIR HONESTLY
APPRAISAL OF THE STATE OF OURNATION, THE ISSUES MOST
IMPORTANT TO THEM AND THE 17COMPETING VISIONS OF AMERICA'S
FUTURE OFFER HAVE DECIDED THISIS WHAT THEY LIKE.
>> THEY'RE RAPISTS --
>> Jon: REINCE.
