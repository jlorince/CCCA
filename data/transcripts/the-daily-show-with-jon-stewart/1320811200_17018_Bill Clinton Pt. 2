>> Jon: HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS?
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE A FUNNY EDIT
IN THE INTERVIEW.
SO THE REST OF IT IS ON THE WEB.
YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.
WE TALK MOSTLY ABOUT "JERSEY
SHORE."
(LAUGHTER)
THE REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT FOR
GROWTH IS ALWAYS THE SAME IN
ALMOST ANY CONDITION, WHICH IS
DEREGULATE AND CUT TAXES.
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE IN THE BOOK
THERE IS... YOU DO SAY CORPORATE
TAX SHOULD COME DOWN.
WHEN YOU WERE PRESIDENT YOU
LOWERED CAPITAL GAINS.
IS THAT SAYING... WHY IS THAT?
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO INCREASE
INCOME INEQUALITY RATHER THAN
HELP IT.
>> WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT NOW
AND THEN I'LL... BUT BRIEFLY,
KEEP IN MIND, WHEN I WAS
PRESIDENT, FIRST I RAISED TAXES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ON INDIVIDUALS AND
CORPORATIONS.
ON THE WEALTHIEST 1.2% OF US AND
ON CORPORATIONS.
AND I CUT THE DEDUCTIONS
CORPORATION COULD TAKE FOR
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND
ELIMINATED THE TAX DEDUCTION FOR
LOBBYING EXPENSES.
SO THEN WHEN THE REPUBLICANS WON
THE CONGRESS, I BASICALLY
BELIEVED THAT THE SYSTEM IS
GEARED FOR COMPROMISE AND I
THOUGHT, NUMBER ONE, WE WERE
TRYING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET, WE
WERE 90% OF THE WAY HOME BEFORE
THE BALANCE BUDGET ACT EVEN
PASSED.
AND IF I AGREED TO CUT THE
CAPITAL GAINS RATE FROM 28% TO
20%, IN RETURN FOR THAT WHAT I
GOT WAS THE HIGHER EDUCATION TAX
CREDITS, THE HOPE SCHOLARSHIPS
WE CALL THEM, AND A MILLION
PEOPLE IN WORK STUDY, THE
BIGGEST INCREASE IF HIGHER
EDUCATION AID SINCE THE G.I.
BILL AND THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH
INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH NOW
INSURES ABOUT TEN MILLION KIDS.
AND IF YOU READ THAT POVERTY
REPORT TODAY, IT'S
SINGLE-HANDEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN MOVING OUT
OF POVERTY.
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD
COMPROMISE AND I DIDN'T THINK IT
WOULD HURT THE ECONOMY.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WENT
TO 15%, I PERSONALLY THOUGHT
THAT WAS WAY TOO LOW BECAUSE THE
AVERAGE PERSON PAYS WITH ALL THE
DEDUCTIONS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT
20.5% OF TAXES AND I DON'T THINK
YOU WANT CAPITAL GAINS TO GET
TOO MUCH BELOW THAT.
THAT'S NOT GOOD POLICY.
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS AN
HONORABLE COMPROMISE.
NOW WHERE ARE WE NOW?
WHEN I RAISED THE CORPORATE TAX
RATE FROM 33% TO 35% ON
CORPORATIONS OF INCOMES OVER $10
MILLION A YEAR, THAT PUT US
SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL
THE RICH COUNTRIES.
SINCE THEN EVERYBODY'S DONE TWO
THINGS, THEY'VE LOWERED THEIR
CORPORATE TAX RATE AND THEY HAVE
STOPPED TAXING THE INCOME THAT
CORPORATIONS EARN IN OTHER
COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES HOME.
>> Jon: THERE'S AMNESTY ON
THAT MONEY.
THEY CAN BRING IT HOME.
>> OTHER COUNTRIES.
WE STILL DO IT WE SAY YOU GET A
DEDUCTION FROM WHAT YOU PAY IN
OTHER COUNTRIES BUT YOU STILL
OWE THE 35% MY IN US THE
DEDUCTION.
>> Jon: BUT THE REAL CORPORATE
TAX RATE IS MUCH LOWER THAN
THAT.
>> SO THE REASON I THINK IT
SHOULD CHANGE IS FIRST, MOST
PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING IT.
THE CORPORATE TAX TAKE, THE
ACTUAL AMOUNT PAID IS 23%, WHICH
IS 1% BELOW THE AVERAGE OF OTHER
WEALTHY COUNTRIES.
>> Jon: WHO'S DOING THE
MANUFACTURING... WHO'S PLANNING
THIS AT A CENTRAL LEVEL?
THAT MAKES ME CRAZY.
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE HAVE
ONE.
CHINA'S GOT A FACTORY WITH
400,000 PEOPLE IN IT.
THEY WORK IN CONDITIONS THAT NO
AMERICAN SHOULD EVER HAVE TO
EXPERIENCE, CUTTING CORPORATE
TAX RATES ISN'T GOING TO BRING..
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO... THAT
SHOULDN'T BE THE GOVERNMENT'S
ROLE.
WHAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT IS
WHERE DO WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE?
FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOLAR ENERGY AND
WIND ENERGY BOTH OF WHICH WOULD
ALREADY BE COMPETITIVE WITH COAL
IF YOU HAD TO PAY THE EXTRANEOUS
COSTS OF COAL, THE HEALTH CARE
COSTS AND OTHER THINGS AND WHICH
WILL BE WIND WITHIN TWO YEARS,
SOLAR WITHIN FIVE WILL BE
COMPETITIVE IN PRICE WITH COAL.
THEY'RE BOTH CHEAPER THAN
NUCLEAR RIGHT NOW.
AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET THE
COMPETITION IN TERMS OF THE TAX
INCENTIVES AND OTHER THINGS TO
BRING THESE MANUFACTURING JOBS
HERE.
IF WE DO, WE'RE GOING TO DO
FINE.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT VENTURE
CAPITAL NETWORK.
WE HAVE MASSIVE CAPACITY IN ALL
THESE CLEAN TECH AREAS.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WE WERE BYPASSED IN THE LAST
DECADE BY GERMANY IN THE
PRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF
SOLAR CELLS.
THE SUN SHINES ON AVERAGE IN
GERMANY AS MUCH AS IT DOES IN
LONDON.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT DEUTSCHE BANK, NOT
GREENPEACE, DEUTSCHE BANK DID A
STUDY...
>> Jon: (LAUGHS)
>> SAYING THAT EVEN IF YOU
ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBSIDIES THE
GERMAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GERMAN
PEOPLE PAID TO GET THAT SOLAR
PANEL, THEY STILL NETTED 300,000
JOBS.
SO WE'RE FOUR TIMES AS BIG AND
TWICE AS CAPABLE.
SO YOU DO THE MATH.
IT'S 2.5 MILLION JOBS IF WE DID
WHAT THEY DID.
WE HAVE GOT TO BE EXEATIVE IN
THESE AREAS.
AND I DON'T MIND GIVING PEOPLE
TAX CREDITS BUT IT OUGHT TO BE
GENERATE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY IN
AMERICA.
>> Jon: THERE'S GOT TO BE
CAVEATS.
I AGREE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
"BACK TO WORK."
YOU SHOULD READ THIS.
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
PRESIDENT BILL
