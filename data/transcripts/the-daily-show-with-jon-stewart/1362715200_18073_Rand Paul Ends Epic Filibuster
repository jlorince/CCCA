>> Jon: BAM!
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I AM PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, THE HEAD COACH OF THE NEW YORK FOOTBALL GIANTS, TOM
COUGHLIN IS JOINING US LATER.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HE IS A GOOD AND DECENT MAN WHO SHOULD IN NO WAY LOWER HIMSELF TO APPEAR ON A PROGRAM LIKE THIS
BUT WE'RE EXCITED HE HAS.
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW YESTERDAY SENATOR RAND PAUL EMBARKED ON A FILIBUSTER TO DRAW ATTENTION TO
THE ISSUE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S SEEMINGLY UNCHECKED POWER TO USE DRONES ON AMERICAN SOIL.
THE LIBERTARIAN SENATOR SPOKE FOR 12 HOURS FOR THEIFIED ONLY BY THE OCCASIONAL NOUGAT FILLED
GOVERNMENT HANDOUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND BRIEF RESPIT THANKS TO LIKE-MINDED SENATORS WHO SHARE HIS COMMITMENT TO CHECKING
EXECUTIVE POWER.
WAIT A MINUTE, IS THAT MITCH McCONNELL?
>> FIRST LET ME THANK HIM FOR HIS COURAGE AND CONVICTION, THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD ANSWER A
QUESTION DOES THE ADMINISTRATION TAKE THE VIEW THAT A DRONE STROKE AGAINST A U.S. ZEN ON
U.S. SOIL WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THAT WEAPON.
>> Jon: SIMMER DOWN TURTLE MAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T THINK DRONE STRIKES --
[LAUGHTER]
ER?
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE OTHER SENATORS.
THE OTHER SENATORS ARE REETIONENT ADDITIONS TO THE SENATE SO I DON'T MIND THEM JUMPING INTO PAUL'S FILIBUSTER
BUT YOU DON'T GET TO JUMP IN ON THE CONCERN THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH MIGHT BE TRAMPLING THE
CRIEWTION TRAIN.
AS I REMEMBER THE HABEAS CORPUS SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE PRESIDENT TO SIGN OFF ON WIRETAPPING I
BELIEVE YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT WAS -- YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BACK TO SENATOR PAUL, IT WAS A THOROUGHLY ENTERTAINING DISPLAY OF MORAL FORTITUDE WHICH SADLY
COME TO AN END THAT ALL FILIBUSTERS MUST.
>> I WOULD GO FOR ANOTHER 12 HOURS TO BROKE STORM'S RECORD BUT THERE ARE LIMITS TO
FILIBUSTERING AND I'M GOING HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ONE OF THOSE IN A FEW MINUTES HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY CAN'T GO 12 HOURS WITHOUT MASTURBATING.
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE -- WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT?
OH, HE'S TALKING
