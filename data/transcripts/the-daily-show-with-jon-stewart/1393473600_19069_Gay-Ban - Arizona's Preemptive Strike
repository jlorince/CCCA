[LAUGHTER]I HAD NOT REALIZED THE EXTENT
TO WHICH THE GOOD PIOUSPEOPLES OF ARIZONA HAVE BEEN
SUBJECTED TO THE TYRANNY OFARIZONA'S, OF COURSE, STILL
ILLEGAL GAY WEDDING INDUSTRY.
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OFTHE GENTLEMEN WHO VOTED FOR THISBILL.
>> CAN YOU GIVE ME A SPECIFICEXAMPLE OF SOMEONE IN ARIZONA
WHO IS FORCED TO DO SOMETHINGAGAINST THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEF
OR SUCCESSFULLY SUED BECAUSE OFTHEIR FAITH?
>> I THINK IF ANYTHING, THISBILL IS PREEMPTIVE.
>> BUT YOU CAN'T CITE ONEEXAMPLE WHERE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
IS UNDER ATTACK IN ARIZONA?
>> NOT NOW, NO, BUT HOW ABOUTTOMORROW?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YOU SEE HERE IN
ARIZONA WE'RE ALL ABOUTPROTECTING OURSELVES FROM
POSSIBLE FUTURES.
THAT'S WHY I ALSO COSPONSOREDTHE ROBOT
VOTER I.D. BILL OF 2042. KEEPYOUR TITANIUM PINCERS OF MYGRANDKIDS YOU DIRTY ROBOT.
WHAT GOVERNOR IN THEIR RIGHTMIND WOULD SIGN THIS PIECE OF
(bleep)?
>> WILL ARIZONA GOVERNOR JANBREWER SIGN OR VETO IT?
>> I HAVE UNTIL FRIDAY ORSATURDAY MORNING TO DETERMINE
THAT.
>> Jon: CLEARLY THE GOVERNORIS BICURIOUS ON THIS BILL.
[LAUGHTER]IF YOU ARE GOING TO SIGN IT YOU
MIGHT WANT TO HURRY BECAUSE THELAWMAKERS WHO VOTED FOR THE BILL
ARE STARTING TO REALIZE WHAT THE(bleep) THEY JUST DID.
>> WHY DO YOU REGRET YOUR VOTE?
>> IT WENT THROUGH REALLY QUICK.
NO ONE HAD ANYTHING TELLING MEDON'T DO IT.
WE, SEVERAL OF US TALKED.
WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS ISN'TGOOD.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE STATE.
AND -- BUT -- NO ONE HAD SAIDANYTHING AND WE THOUGHT WELL,
WE'LL VOTE FOR IT.
WE MADE A MISTAKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: I KNOW HOW IT IS, YOU
KNOW?
YOU'RE SITTING AROUND A COUPLELEGISLATORS, LATE AT NIGHT AND
NO ONE IS AROUND.
[ LAUGHTER ]THREE OF YOU JUST DECIDE TO
EXPERIMENT WITH INTOLERANCE BUT,YOU KNOW, THINGS GO A LITTLE TOO
FAR AND THEN THE NEXT DAY NOBODYCAN MAKE EYE CONTACT.
IT WAS JUST ONE BILL AND IDIDN'T EVEN ENJOY PASSING IT.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME A HOMOPHOBE.
OF COURSE THEY ARE HAVING SECONDTHOUGHTS BECAUSE THE BILL THEY
PASSED WAS MORALLY REPUGNANT ASI ASSUME EVERYONE NOW REALIZES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> CRITICS OF THE BILL SAY IT
SANCTIONS DISCRIMINATIONPARTICULARLY AGAINST GAY PEOPLE
BUT OTHERS COULD BE IMPACTED ASWELL.
A MUSLIM COULD REFUSE TO DOBUSINESS WITH CHRISTIANS BECAUSE
HE MIGHT CONSIDER THEM INFIDELS.
>> Jon: RIGHT THE PEOPLE WHOVOTED FOR IT REALIZED THAT
MUSLIMS COULD REFUSE SERVICE TOTHEM.
RIGHT, BUT THEY ARE BACKING AWAYFROM IT BECAUSE IT'S MORALLY
REPUGNANT, RIGHT?
>> I HOPE THAT GOVERNOR BREWERWHO IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINEWILL
VETO.
MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S THEIMPRESSION IT'S CREATING BECAUSE
IT'S VIEWED AS DISCRIMINATORY.
>> Jon: NO, NO IT'S NOT ANIMPRESSION. IT'S DISCRIMINATORY.
THAT'S NOT WHY YOU ARE AGAINSTIT.
YOU ARE AGAINST IT BECAUSE IT'SMORALLY REPUGNANT?
>> THIS CAN EFFECT TOURISM, THESTATE'S ECONOMY AND JOB
CREATION.
>> THE ARIZONA SUPER BOWL HOSTCOMMITTEE SAYS IT COULDJEOPARDIZE PLANS
FOR THE STATE TO HOST NEXTYEAR'S GAME.
>> Jon: AND IT'S MORALLY --YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS WHERE YOU ARE NOWARIZONA. YOU'VE MADE YOURSELVESTOO
HOMOPHOBIC AND DICKISH FORPROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]ACCORDING TO THE NFL THE NEW
WATCHDOG OF GAY RIGHTS NONE OFTHE REASONS THAT YOU HAVE CITED
THE FACT THAT MAYBE MUSLIMSCOULD USE IT AGAINST US OR OH,
MY GOD PEOPLE WON'T WANT TO DOBUSINESS WITH US HAVE NOTHING TO
DO WITH MORALITY.
BUT WITH SO MANY GOOD REASONSNOT PASS THIS BILL, IT MAKES YOUWONDER HOW IT GOT THIS FAR INTHE FIRST PLACE.
MEGYN KELLY HAS A THEORY.
>> WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE ON THE
RELIGIOUS RIGHT WHO SAY THEYFEEL
RELIGION IS UNDER ATTACK.
I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND WONDERWHETHER IT'S AN OVERREACTION TO
PEOPLE WHO FEEL UNDER ATTACK.
>> Jon: GOOD POINT.
AN OVERREACTION?
WHERE WOULD PEOPLE OF FAITH,WHERE WOULD ARIZONANS HAVEGOTTEN THE
IDEA THAT RELIGION IS UNDERATTACK IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> IS OUR NATION LOSING ITSRELIGIOUS FOUNDATION?
>> SHOULD YOU BE PUNISHED FORYOUR FAITH?
>> WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THE HOLYBREAKDOWN.
>> CHRISTMAS UNDER ATTACK.
>> IT'S A WAR ON EASTER.
IT'S A WAR ON RELIGION.
>> AMERICAN ASSAULT ON RELIGION.
>> RELIGION UNDER ATTACK.
>> RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS UNDERATTACK.
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEASSAULT ON CHRISTIANITY?
>> UNITY AND FAITH COMES UNDERFIRE.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD RELIGIOUSPEOPLE OVERREACT TO THAT
CONSTANT BARRAGE OF APOCALYPTICPARANOIA AND OUTRAGE?
GOD ONLY KNOWS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
