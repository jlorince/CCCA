LET'S GET AS FAR AWAY FROM
THAT STORY AS WE POSSIBLY
CAN.
LET'S GO TO RUSSIA.
ALSO KNOWN AS THE COUNTRY TO
WHICH EDWARD SNOWDEN IS NOW
HAVING HIS MAIL FORWARDED.
NOW AS YOU'LL RECALL WHILE
THE SUPREME COURT HERE WAS
OVERTURNING THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT IN RUSSIA, THEY
PASSED A BRAND-NEW ANTI-GAY
PROPAGANDA LAW AND DESPITE
CRITICISM, THEY ARE
DEFENDING THEIR DECISION.
>> RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
VLADIMIR PUTIN PUBLICLY
DEFENDED THE LAW EARLIER
THIS SUMMER.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT IMPOSING
ANY KIND OF SANCTIONS
AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY, HE
SAID THIS IS ABOUT
PROTECTING CHILDREN.
>> IS IT THOUGH?
IS IT?
ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T SOME
HOMOPHOBIC LEGISLATION
PASSED JUST TO PREVENT THE
YOU WEREAN POLICE WERE BEING
MADE FUN OF BECAUSE WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THEIR UNIFORMS IN
THE MIRROR THEY SAY HOMO.
YOU SURE THAT'S NOT IT?
YOU SURE THAT'S NOT IT?
THAT IS A LITTLE TRICKY WHEN
THEY ARE PULLING YOU OVER.
OLGA, HOW FAST WERE YOU
GOING.
THE GAY POLICE ARE GAINING
ON US.
REASSURINGLY, THERE'S
ACTUALLY BEEN HUGE
INTERNATIONAL REACTION
AGAINST THIS LAW.
AND IT IS TAKING ALL SORTS
OF FORMS.
>> PROTESTS IN ENGLAND,
SCOTLAND, BELGIUM, CANADA,
THE U.S.
FOR OWNERS OF GAY BARS
DUMPED JURBAN VODKA.
>> POURING VODKA INTO THE
GUTTERS.
A POWERFUL STAND AGAINST
HOMOPHOBIA AND FOR DRUNK
SEWER ALLIGATORS.
I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
THE PROBLEM IS, THAT THIS
LAW IS JUST A PART OF A MUCH
LARGER SHIFT TOWARDS PERCENT
CUTION OF GAY PEOPLE IN
RUSSIA.
>> ANOTHER TV ANCHOR IN
RUSSIA COMING UNDER FIRE FOR
THINGS HE SAID ABOUT GAY
PEOPLE DURING A BROADCAST
LAST YEAR.
>> WE NEED TO BAN THEM FROM
DONATING BLOOD AND SPERM.
AND IF THEY DIE IN CAR
ACCIDENTS, WE NEED TO BURY
THEIR HEARTS IN THE GROUND
OR BURN THEM AS THEY ARE
UNSUITABLE FOR THE AIDING OF
ANYONE'S LIFE.
>> WHAT?
BURY THEIR HEARTS IN THE
GROUND-- I-- I THINK HE MAY
BE CONFUSING GAY PEOPLE WITH
VAMPIRES.
NEVER INVITE A GAY INTO YOUR
HOME OR WILL VISIT YOU AT
NIGHT IN THE FORM OF A BAT
OR A FINE MIST.
BUT HERE'S THE THING.
IN RUSSIA, THAT'S ACTUALLY
CONSIDERED ACCURATE
SCIENTIFIC DATA.
>> DMITRI-- INSISTS AFTER
ALL THAT HE IS NOT HOMEO
PHOBIC.
HE SAYS HE WAS SIMPLY
SUPPORTING MEDICAL RULES
DENY-- DESIGNED TO PREVENT
HIV POSITIVE MEN FROM
DONATING BLOOD OR ORGANS.
>> OH, PLEASE THAT IS
RIDICULOUS.
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WOULD
BAN GAY MEN FROM DONATING
BLOOD BASED ON SOME KIND OF
PATHETIC, ARCHAIC AIDS
PARANOIA.
>> RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED
STATES GAY MEN CANNOT DONATE
BLOOD.
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I
WON'T MISS ABOUT HOSTING
THIS SHOW, HAVING PERFECTLY
EDITED SOUND BITES ROUTINELY
