SOME PEOPLE SEE GEORGE
WASHINGTON WRESTLING A
LEPRECHAUN.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY "THE
DAILY SHOW" SENIOR RACE ANALYST
WYATT CENAC.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WYATT, THIS WHOLE INCIDENT WITH
RICK PERRY AND THE BLACK CLOUD
SPEECH, WAS THAT RACIST?
>> JON, LET ME TAKE.
THIS YES, IT WAS.
YES, IT WAS.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY RACIST.
>> Jon: YES, JOHN OLIVER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
>> DON'T WORRY, WYATT, YOU DON'T
NEED TO LOWER YOURSELF TO THIS
BLATANT DISPLAY OF BIGOTRY.
DON'T WORRY.
>> ACTUALLY, JON, I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS BIGOTRY.
>> STOP IT, STOP IT.
YOU'RE UNDERSTANDABLY TOO ANGRY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME CARRY YOUR BURDEN.
I'M SORRY, JON, BUT THE POOR GUY
HAS BEEN BEATEN DOWN JUST LIKE
THOSE POOR PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE
"THE HELP."
[LAUGHTER]
>> WHEN YOU SAY "THOSE PEOPLE,"
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE BLACK
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WENT TO SEE
"THE HELP"?
>> WHAT?
WHY WOULD THEY BE MAD?
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
I'M SORRY.
WE WENT TO SEE "THE HELP" LAST
NIGHT.
OLIVER LIKED IT TO A DISTURBING
DEGREE.
>> YEAH.
, I LOVED IT, JON.
WHITE PEOPLE ARE AMAZING.
[LAUGHTER]
WE REALLY ARE.
>> Jon: CAN I ASK YOU A QUICK
QUESTION?
THE TWO OF YOU WENT TO SEE "THE
HELP" TOGETHER?
>> YEAH.
>> YES.
>> Jon: NOT LIKE "CAPTAIN
AMERICA."
YOU LITERALLY CALLED UP
SOMEBODY, LET'S GO SEE "THE
HELP"?
>> YEAH.
>> YEAH, HAD DINNER AFTERWARDS.
IT WAS GREAT.
>> Jon: TALKING ABOUT THE REAL
ISSUE HERE.
IT SEEMS LIKE RICK PERRY WAS
CLEARLY REFERRING TO THE DEBT AS
A BLACK CLOUD.
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, JON.
YOU CAN'T USE THAT TERM.
NEITHER CAN I.
ONLY WYATT CAN USE THAT TERM, IF
HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH IT.
BESIDES, THIS IS A PATTERN OF
RACIALLY INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE
FROM RICK PERRY.
LISTEN TO WHAT THAT MONSTER SAID
AT CPAC IN 2008.
>> I WOULD SAY THAT WASHINGTON
IS THE BLACK HOLE WHERE TOO MANY
GOOD IDEAS DISAPPEAR.
>> I AM SORRY YOU HAD TO HEAR
THAT, WYATT.
>> HEAR WHAT?
>> "THE BLACK HOLE" IN
WASHINGTON.
RICK PERRY, WHY ARE ALL THE GOOD
IDEAS DISAPPEARING?
IS THE BLACK HOLE STEALING THEM
ALL?
YOU NEVER HEAR ANYONE SAY THAT
ABOUT WHITE HOLE, JON.
HONESTLY, WHAT YEAR ARE WE
LIVING IN HERE?
>> WHAT'S A WHITE HOLE?
>> JUST A GOOD, CHRISTIAN,
HONEST HOLE, A NORMAL HOLE.
JUST A NORMAL HOLE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> JON, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIG
THAT DEEP.
THERE'S REAL RACISM IN THE
WORLD.
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN DOUG LAMBBORN SAID
THIS.
>> EVEN IF SOME PEOPLE SAY THE
REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE DONE
THIS OR THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE
THAT, THEY WILL HOLD THE
PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE.
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO EVEN HAVE
TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM.
IT'S LIKE TOUCHING A TAR BABY
AND YOU GET IT... YOU'RE STUCK
AND YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM
NOW.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.
>> HOLY CRAP.
>> Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY
EVEN USED THAT WORD ANYMORE
EXCEPT UNCLE REMUS.
>> I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT?
ARE YOU TWO OFFENDED BECAUSE YOU
BOTH USED TO BE BABIES?
>> Jon: JOHN, TAR BABY IS AN
OFFENSIVE TERM.
>> NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S A STICKY
BABY THAT'S BEEN COVERED IN TAR.
IN ENGLAND WE CALL THEM TACKY
TOTS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> LOOK, JOHN, "TAR BABY" IS A
TERM THAT CAN'T BE
MISINTERPRETED.
BLACK CLOUD IS COMMONLY USED AS
A METAPHOR.
THE REAL BIGOT IS ED SCHULTZ.
>> Jon: WAIT.
WHAT NOW?
>> YEAH, YEAH, ED SCHULTZ HAS A
LONG, DISGUSTING HISTORY OF
USING RACIALLY CHARGED LANGUAGE.
>> CHUCK, SPECULATION IS THE RED
HERRING.
>> RED HERRING?
WHAT'S HE SAYING ABOUT NATIVE
AMERICAN PEOPLE?
>> SO NATIVE AMERICANS ARE
HERRINGS TO HIM, JUST FISHY,
UNTRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE?
>> YEAH, THAT NEED TO BE CAUGHT
AND FED TO OUR GOVERNMENT
PENGUINS?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S A
REACH.
>> IT IS?
>> IT IS, JON?
>> IS IT?
IS IT?
>> IT IS REALLY A REACH, JON?
>> IS IT?
IS IT?
>> IS IT REALLY REACHING THAT
FAR?
BECAUSE AFTER YOU SEE THIS, YOU
MIGHT OWE US AN APOLOGY.
>> THE GREAT WHITE HOPE.
>> THE BLUE DOG, THE RED DOG,
THE YELLOW DOGS.
>> THE WHITE MAN.
>> THE WHITE LIE.
PURPLE-STATE VOTEDDERS.
>> BROWN SHIRTS.
>> RED HANDED.
>> THE YELLOW LOBSTER.
[LAUGHTER]
JON JON GUY,ER GOT TO TELL YOU,
I THINK THAT ONE LITERALLY WAS
ABOUT A YELLOW LOBSTER.
>> REALLY, JON?
YOU DON'T THINK HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT CHINA?
REALLY?
AN ASIAN LOBSTER ALL YELLOW WITH
ITS PINCHERS COLLAPSED AROUND
THE NUTS OF AMERICA?
OH, I WONDER HOW THAT LOBSTER
WOULD SOUND TO ED SCHULTZ.
OH, HELLO, I'M A LOBSTER.
HELLO, LOOK AT MY CLAWS.
HEW-WOW.
>> Jon: THAT IS OFFENSIVE.
>> IT IS OFFENSIVE.
SHAME ON YOU, SCHULTZ.
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
>> I CAN'T GET THE BAD MAN OUT
OF MY BRAIN.
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER
