>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN, WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU
TODAY.
SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.
WE'RE BACK, BABY.
ON TONIGHT ELLEN SCHULTZ, THE
AUTHOR OF THE RETIREMENT HEIST
WHICH IS A GREAT FLICK.
STARRING JACK NICHOLSON.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S ABOUT PENSION FUNDS
MAXIMIZING THEIR OWN PROFIT.
IT'S SO FAR FETCHED.
HERE'S WHAT I THINK HAPPENED.
I THINK THE TATTOO GUY PUT A
HOT GIRL ON HIS LEG, RIGHT?
THE TATTOO GUY (BEEP) AND THEN
YOU'RE LIKE SCREW IT.
JUST THROW A BOBO-FET HELMET
ON IT.
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK HE DID.
GET A TATTOO OF BOBA-FET AS A
WOMAN.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS
THE ORIGINAL INTENT.
I BELIEVE THE ORIGINAL INTENT
WAS LIKE I LOVE I DREAM OF
JEANY.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT HER ON MY
LEG.
