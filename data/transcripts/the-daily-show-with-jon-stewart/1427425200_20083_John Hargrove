( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A FORMER ORCATRAINER AT SEAWORLD.
HE'S WRITTEN ABOUT THATEXPERIENCE IN HIS NEW BOOK
"BENEATH THE SURFACE: KILLERWHALES, SEAWORLD, AND THE TRUTH
BEYOND BLACKFISH."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMJOHN HARGROVE.
JOHN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )ALL RIGHT, SIR.
"BENEATH THE SURFACE".YOU HAVE WRITTEN --
YOU'RE CONSIDERED AWHISTLEBLOWER FOR SEAWORLD.
HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ATSEAWORLD?
>> 12 YEARS OUT OF MY 14-YEARCAREER.
>> Jon:  OUT OF YOUR 14-YEARCAREER.
>> I SPENT TWO YEARS AT ANOTHERKILLER WHALE FACILITY IN
FRANCE.
>> Jon: OH, OKAY.
NOW, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OFCONTROVERSIAL GUESTS ON THIS
SHOW.
JUST THIS WEEK, WE HAD FILMMAKERS WHO MADE A FILM ABOUT
RAPE ON CAMPUS, COLLEGECAMPUSES.
WE HAD ON AYAAN HIRSI ALI WHOTALKED ABOUT REFORMING ISLAM.
WE HAVE NEVER HAD A TWITTERRESPONSE AIMED AT US FOR YOUR
APPEARANCE.
THERE ARE PEOPLE SENDING US"DON'T TRUST THIS GUY.
HE'S A LIAR," MAINLY WITHSEAWORLD TWITTER HANDLE
ADDRESSES.
>> BIG SHOCKER THERE.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon: THIS IS, THIS IS CRAZY.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  WHAT IS THAT?
>> IT IS A CULT-LIKE MENTALITY.
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE-- IF YOU EVERLEAVE AND YOU DARE SPEAK OUT,
THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPENTO YOU.
THEY'RE GOING TO GO AFTER YOUVICIOUSLY.
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO SILENCEYOU.
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY THEYHAVE GOTTEN AWAY FOR DECADES
WITH SILENCING TRAINERS.
>> Jon: IN YOURCAREER,
SO YOU'RE TRAINING WHALES,AT WHAT POINT,
DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, "OH,THIS IS A SENTIENT CREATURE,
AND WHAT I'M DOING ISN'T RIGHT"?
>> YOU KNOW, THAT IS A GREATQUESTION BECAUSE IN THE
BEGINNING YOU DON'T KNOWWHAT'S NORMAL FROM ABNORMAL
OR HEALTHY FROM UNHEALTHY.
SO WHEN YOU GET INTO IT IN THEBEGINNING, YOU THINK, ARE ALL
THE DORSAL FINS LIKE THATCOLLAPSEED IN THE WILD?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ARE ALL THEIR TEETH WORN DOWNLIKE THAT IN THE WILD?
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.
BUT THEN ONCE YOU REALIZETHAT THESE ARE THE DAMAGING
EFFECTS FROM CAPTIVITY, ANDTHEY'RE DYING PREMATURELY,
THEY'RE DYING FROM ILLNESSESAND DISEASE THEY'RE NOT
DYING FROM IN THE WILD.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU SEE ALL THESE THINGS, ANDTHE MOTHER-CALF SEPARATIONS, AND
HOW TRAUMATIC THAT IS FOR THOSEANIMALS, EVEN YEARS LATER.
I MEAN, YOU JUST GET IT AT SOMEPOINT MORALLY AND ETHICALLY THIS
IS JUST NOT RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, AND WHAT THEPROBLEM IS, IS THAT AT THAT
POINT, YOU'RE STUCK BECAUSE YOULOVE THOSE WHALES SO MUCH.
THIS IS YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAM.
YOU FEEL LIKE, OKAY-- YOURATIONALIZE IT AWAY, ALMOST LIKE
A BAD RELATIONSHIP.
>> Jon:  SURE.
I HAVE TO SAY EVEN GOING THEREYOU RATIONALIZE IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I'VE BEEN THERE.
I WENT THERE ONCE, I WANTED MYKID TO SEE IT, YOU KNOW, AND
WHILE YOU'RE THERE YOU'RE LIKE,OH YOU KNOW, JEEZ, THAT'S A
PRETTY GOOD-SIZED SWIMMINGPOOL.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, AND THENYOU LEAVE AND YOU'RE LIKE,
NOT FOR A WHALE.
>> NO, AND THE SAD PART ISIS THAT WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE
FRONT SHOW POOL, VERY RARELY DOTHOSE WHALES HAVE ACCESS
TO ALL OF THOSE POOLS.
MOST OFTEN, WE RESTRICT THOSEWHALES TO JUST ONE OR TWO POOLS,
AND MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THEDAY, THEY'RE IN AN
EIGHT-FOOT-DEEP MED POOL, THAT'STHE DIMENSIONS OF A BACKYARD
SWIMMING POOL.
>> Jon: IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVETHIS TYPE OF THING IN A HUMANE
WAY, OR ARE WEKIDDING OURSELVES?
ARE WE KIDDING OURSELVES THAT INANY WAY YOU CAN KEEP THESE
LARGE, VERY SMART MAMMALS, ANDEVEN TREATING THEM MORE HUMANELY
WITH LESS CHEMICALS AND MOREROOM, IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO DO?
>> IT'S NOT.
AND I WISH THAT I COULD TELL YOUTHAT IT WAS.
IT WOULD MAKE MY JOB AND THE WAYTHAT I REFLECT BACK ON MY LIFE
AND MY CAREER WITH THOSEANIMALS, MAKE ME SLEEP EASIER AT
NIGHT.
BUT WE-- WE TRIED WITH THE BESTRESOURCES THAT WE HAD, AND IT IS
CLEAR TO SEE, WE HAVE ANOVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF SCIENCE
THAT PROVES THAT THESE ANIMALSARE NOT ONLY NOT THRIVING.
THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURVIVING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THE DAMAGE, THEPSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE, AND THE
PHYSICAL DAMAGE IS APPARENT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ANEXPERIENCED KILLER WHALE TRAINER
LIKE I AM.
YOU CAN GO TO THE PARK, AND YOUCAN LOOK AT THOSE WHALES, LOOK
AT THEIR TEETH, LOOK AT THECOLLAPSED DORSAL FIN, LOOK AT
THE DEATH RATES OF THE WHALESAND THE AGES THAT THEY DIED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND KNOW THAT THIS IS JUSTMORALLY AND ETHICALLY
MESSED UP.
>> Jon: WELL EVEN THAT, THERE'STHAT ONE SCENE IN "BLACKFISH"
WHERE THEY'RE SEPARATING THEBABIES FROM THE MOTHERS,
AND YOU SEE THEM GO BANANAS.
LIKE, THEY ARE MOURNING.
THEY'RE GOING CRAZY.
>> IT'S HORRIBLE. IT'S HORRIBLE.
>> Jon: AND THAT -- IS THAT--AND WHEN YOU SEE
THAT, KNOWING THAT IS WHAT'SHAPPENING AND KNOWING THAT
THAT'S GOING ON, CAN-- ARE THEYPOWERLESS TO PUT THEM BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN OR THEY JUST HAVETO SAY LIKE, HEY, THIS IS THE
JUST THE WAY WE DO THINGS?
>> YOU MEAN AS A TRAINER?
>> Jon:  YEAH.
>> OH, I WOULD FIGHT IT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT I MEAN, YOU CAN'T. LIKE,YOU KNOW, YOU, YOU KID YOURSELF
TO THINK THAT ONCE YOU'RE AHIGH ENOUGH LEVEL RANKED
TRAINER I'M GOING TOVOICE UP I'M GOING TO --
>> Jon: YOU'LL CHANGE THINGS.
>> YES, I'LL CHANGE THINGS ANDTHEN YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE NO
POWER.
YOU CAN'T STOP THIS MOTHER-CALFSEPARATION.
WHAT I LOVE IS LIKE THE ( BLEEP ) SEAWORLD PROPAGANDA.
THEY HAVE ON THEIR WEB SITE,EVEN TO THIS DAY, WHICH SHOWS
HOW STUPID THEY ARE-- "WE DO NOTSEPARATE MOTHERS FROM THEIR
CALVES."
OKAY, I KNOW OF, OFF THE TOP OFMY HEAD, WHICH IS PROBABLY
MORE BUT WITH 100% CERTAINTY,WE TOOK 19 CALVES AWAY
FROM THEIR MOTHERS.
OKAY AND THEN, BUT ON THAT PAGETHAT SAYS, "WE DO NOT SEPARATE
MOTHERS FROM THEIR CALVES,"THEY HAVE A PICTURE OF
TAKARA, WITH HER CALF KOHANA.
RIGHT NOW TAKARA IS IN TEXAS,AND KOHANA IS IN SPAIN.
SO THEY'RE SO STUPID THEYCOULDN'T EVEN USE A PICTURE
WHERE THE TWO WHALES AREACTUALLY STILL TOGETHER.
>> Jon: DO THEY, IS THERE ANYCHANCE THAT KOHANA IS JUST
STUDYING ABROAD FOR A SEMESTER?
"BENEATH THE SURFACE."
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
JOHN HARGROVE.
