>> Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY.
HOW ARE YOU?
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, MYNAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A FINE FINE PROGRAMFOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST, TAVIS SMILEY ISGOINGTO BE JOINING US.
I ALWAYS ENJOY TALKING TOTAVIS.
VERY INTERESTING MAN.
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITHTHE MEDIA BLOCKBUSTER.
>> ROLLING STONE IS NOWRETRACTING ITS UVA RAPE
STORY AFTER THIS DEVASTATINGREVIEW BY THE COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOLOF JOURNALISM.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT!
IT TURNS OUT THAT ROLLINGSTONE, THE MAGAZINE THAT
GAVE 5 STARS TO THE MOSTRECENT U2 ALBUM--
(LAUGHTER) MAY NOT BE THE MOST
RELIABLE SOURCE OFINFORMATION.
SO WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT WENT DOWN?
IS THIS A WHAT DO YOU CALL ITLIKE A STEPHEN GLASS
NEW REPUBLIC TYPE MAKE THEM UPTHERESTORY, A ROGUE REPORTER,
VEERS INTO FICTION WRITINGWITHOUT TELLING HER EDITORS?
>> THE NEW REPORT CONCLUDES THATREPORTER SABRINA ERDELY AND
HER EDITORS FAILED TO VERIFY HERSTORY WITH OTHER SOURCES.
THE MAGAZINE USED PSEUDONYMSRATHER THAN CONFRONT THE
ALLEGED ATTACKERS AND THEYIGNORED FACT CHECKERS'
WARNINGS THAT THE ALLEGEDVICTIM WAS THE ARTICLE'S
ONLY SOURCE FOR KEY DETAILS.
>> IT WAS THE COLLECTIVEFAULT OF THE REPORTER, THE
EDITOR, THE EDITOR'SSUPERVISOR AND THE FACT
CHECKING DEPARTMENT.
>> Jon: THE SCHOOLS THEYATTENDED.
THEIR PARENTS AND RELIGIOUSLEADERS.
AND ODDLY ENOUGH YOKO ONO.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS I THINK A
LOT OF HEADS ARE GOING TO BEJOINING THE MAGAZINE'S
EPONYMOUS STONED IN THEIRBELOVED PASS TIME OF THAT
HEADS ARE GOING TO ROLL ISWHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.
>> ROLLING STONE ANNOUNCEDTHAT EVERYONE WOULD KEEP
THEIR JOBS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]?
THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT HOWTHIS WORKS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE, IF NOBODYELSE HAS THE GUTS TO DO IT,
I WILL FIRE THEM.
I'M MAKING A CITIZEN'SFIRING.
(LAUGHTER)PACK UP YOUR DESKS AND GIVE
ME THE NUMBER OF SECURITYTHERE.
I WILL HAVE THEM ESCORT YOUOUT.
HOW CAN THERE BE NOCONSEQUENCES
FOR AN ERROR OF THISMAGNITUDE?
>> PUBLISHER JANN WENNERBELIEVES THE REPORT IS
ENOUGH PUNISHMENT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THE REPORT IS
ACTUALLY NOT PUNISHMENT ATALL!
IT IS A LIST OF THINGS, INMANY CIRCUMSTANCES,
PEOPLE WOULD BE PUNISHED FOR.
YOU'RE MISSING THE EVERCRUCIAL SENTENCING PHASE.
THE COURT FINDS YOU GUILTYSO LET'S ALL GO GET SOME ITALIAN
ICES. NO! I MEAN, YOU HAVE HADTO SIT HERE AND HEAR ALL THESE
TERRIBLE THINGS YOU DID.
YOU MUST BE VERY SAD.
NO.
THIS ISN'T A GAFFE OR A BRAINFART OR A WHOOPSIE DAISY,
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
AND YOU CAN'T JUST DEAL WITH ITBY ISSUING A CORRECTION LIKE
THE TIME YOU SPELLED KESHA'SNAME WITH AN AMPERSAND
INSTEAD OF A CASH MONEY SIGN.
THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENEDHERE.
SHE ACTUALLY WASN'T LOST ATSEA, EITHER.
THAT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO BECORRECTED IN THE MAGAZINE.
BUT THIS UVA STORY IS AMONUMENTAL [BLEEP] UP
TERRITORY.
CAMPUS RAPE HAPPENS WITHSHOCKING FREQUENCY, A VERY
REAL UNDERREPORTED PROBLEMTHAT MANY COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIONSHAVE MET WITH A LACK OF CONCERN
AN STONEWALLING.
VICTIMS NEED HELP ANDSUPPORT YET SOMEHOW IN A SEA
OF VERIFIABLE ASSAULTS, YOU MANAGE TO WHERE'S WALDO
THE ONLY RAPE STORY THAT NOTWOULD FAIL TO GET YOUR POINT
ACROSS BUT SET THE CAUSEBACK.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO GO.
ROLLING STONE, I'M FORCED-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ROLLING STONE, INFACT I'M FORCED TO JUDGE YOU
BY YOUR OWN METHODS AND WILLGIVE YOU YOUR OWN HARSHEST
CRITICISM. THREE AND A HALFSTARS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
