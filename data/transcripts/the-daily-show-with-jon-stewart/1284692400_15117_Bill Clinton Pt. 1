PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>>
>> Jon: THRRT.
-- ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> GLAD TO SEE YOU.
>> Jon: CONGRATULATIONS TO
YOU, BY THE WAY.
CONBEFORE THE LAYINGS ON THE
WEDDING -- CONGRATULATIONS ON
THE WEEING OF YOUR DAUGHTER.
WHAT A -- WEDDING OF YOUR
DAUGHTER.
I OBVIOUSLY SENT MY COULDN'T
MAKE IT RSVP EVEN THOUGH I
WASN'T ACTUALLY INVITED BUT --
HOW DID IT FEEL?
WAS IT EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL?
>> IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL BUT IT
WAS -- YOU KNOW IT'S -- IT'S ONE
OF THOSE PASSAGES IN LIFE THAT
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,
YOUR CHILD IS FINALLY REALLY
GROWN.
I LOVE MY SON-IN-LAW AND I
ADMIRE HIM.
AND I WANTED TO DO THIS WEDDING
JUST THE WAY SHE WANTED IT.
MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMIC
STIMULUS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: VERY NICE OF YOU.
VERY KIND.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> I WAS SORT OF SURPRISED WHEN
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DIDN'T
DROP AFTER THE WEDDING.
>> Jon: TALK TO ME ABOUT THE
CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE THIS
YEAR.
THE BIG THING IS GETTING
COMMITMENT, GETTING PEOPLE TO
STEP UP.
IT'S ALWAYS EASY TO GET PEOPLE
TO COME TO A CONFERENCE BUT
GETTING THEM TO STEP UP
FINANCIALLY.
>> THE WHOLE REASON WE STARTED
THIS.
THIS IS UP ON SIXTH ONE IS
BECAUSE I GOT TIRED OF GOING TO
MEETINGS AND HAVING EVERYBODY
SAY INTELLIGENT THINGS AND
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.
WE DECIDED ON A WILD LEAP TO SEE
IF PEOPLE WOULD COME TO A
MEETING WHERE THE CONDITION WAS
COMING BACK WAS MAKING A
COMMITMENT AND BEGINNING TO
IMPLEMENT IT.
IN FIVE YEARS WE'VE HAD
COMMITMENTS THAT WILL BE WORTH
$57 BILLION HELPING PEOPLE ALL
OVER THE WORLD IN OVER 200
COUNTRIES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: IS THERE A CERTAIN
INDUSTRY THAT STEPS UP MORE THAN
OTHERS?
ARE THERE CERTAIN INDUSTRIES
THAT HAVE SURPRISED YOU WITH
THEIR CHARITY AND THEIR TIP OF?
ARE THERE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS
THAT HAVE SURPRISED YOU?
>> 50% OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME
ARE IN BUSINESS BUT THEY ARE NOT
ALL HEADS OF BIG CORPORATIONS.
THEY ARE NOT ALL FABULOUSLY
WEALTHY.
A LOT OF THEM RUN SMALL AND
MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES.
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW TO INVEST
THEIR MONEY IN A WAY THAT CAN
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
THEY ARE NOT MASSIVE
COMMITMENTS.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
ONE OF COMMITMENTS MADE FOR THIS
TIME IS BY A GROUP THAT WANTS TO
CREATE 200 SUMMER JOBS FOR
PEOPLE IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NEW YORK TO GO AROUND AND MAKE
THE ENVIRONMENT BETTER, MAKE THE
BUILDINGS MORE EFFICIENT.
ANY OF YOU THAT LIVE IN AN OLD
CITY, EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN NEW
YORK, GO TO A FLATTOP BUILDING
WITH A TAR ROOF.
IF YOU PAINT IT WHITE THAT ONE
THING ALONE WILL DROP THE
ELECTRIC BILLS OF EVERYBODY
LIVING BELOW AND SAVE A LOT OF
POOR.
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING.
THEY ARE NOT ALL BIG.
ON THE OTHER HAND WE SAVE 90
MILLION ACRES FROM DEFORESTATION
AND GOTTEN $1.75 BILLION IN
CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESS
PEOPLE AND HELPED TEN MILLION
MORE PEOPLE GET MICROCREDIT
LOANS.
A LOT OF THAT MONEY COMES FROM
BIG GROUPS, LIKE THE BANKS AND
THINGS THAT HELP BUT THEY ARE
ALL OVER THE MAP IN TERMS OF
SIZE.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
KEEP ANY NUMBERS IN YOUR HEAD.
THAT'S THE MOST
