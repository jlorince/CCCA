YOU, SIR I ARE, THANK YOU, SIRI,
THIS WAS THE INTELLECTUAL LEADER OF THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY'S BIG NIGHT.
HOW WILL HE SPIN HIS WAY OUT OF IT.
>> I DIDN'T SAY PRESIDENT OBAMA SHUT DOWN THAT PLANT, WHAT IT WAS WAS AN INDICTMENT ON A
DEEPER LEVEL WHICH IS A DEBATE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE.
>> I THINK HE DIDN'T PROVIDE CONTEXT.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, BROADER POINT I THINK IS HOW IS THE MY DOING
UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND DID HE KEEP HIS PROMISES?
>> IN BROADER TERMS WHAT IT IS THEY BELIEVE, THAT IS THE DEBATE
I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS GOING TO WATCH VERY CLOSELY.
>> WELL, LOOK, WHEN PEOPLE GIVE SPEECHES, NOT EVERY PACKET IS ALWAYS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE.
>> Jon: OH, YEAH?  WELL, THEY JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF FACTS AND
JUST COMB THEM OVER A GIANT AREA OF (BLEEP)?  HERE IS A PROBLEM,
MR. JULIEN, IF YOU HAVE A FACT THAT IS NOT ACCURATE, IT IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A FACT.
AT THAT POINT IT IS CONSIDERED,
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT, AN UNFACT.
I AM SURE WILL IS A QUICKER WAY OF SAYING THAT.
WE ARE JOINED BY JON, OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER:
>> YOU OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE ON THE FLOOR AND SAW THE SPEECH LAST NIGHT.
>> I DID, JON, AND IT REALLY HIT HOME FOR ME.
>> I GUESS BECAUSE MY PARENTS ONCE OWNED A SMALL BUSINESS, A CANDLE EMPORIUM IN AKRON, OHIO.
IN 2009, PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED AND PROMISED IT WOULD BECOME THE BIGGEST CANDLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD.
TWO WEEKS LATER IT BURNED TO THE GROUND IN A TERRIBLE BEAUTIFULLY TAINTED FIRE.
OBVIOUSLY I STILL TEAR UP WHENEVER I SMELL LAVENDER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
IT IS A POWERFUL STORY.
OBVIOUSLY NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.
YOUR PARENTS ARE DEFENSE IN ENGLAND.
>> THAT IS NOT THE POINT, JON.
WHAT WAS THE THEME OF LAST NIGHT'S CONVENTION?
>> Jon: WE CAN CHANGE IT.
>> EXACTLY.
AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE.
LAST NIGHT'S THEME I CHOSE TO CHANGE FACTS, REALITY AND THE MEANING OF WORDS IN ORDER TO
MAKE A MUCH LARGER POINT.
>> Jon: BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS -- YOU DON'T IGNORE THE TRUTH WHEN IT DOESN'T SUPPORT YOUR PURPLE.
>> YOU CAN WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE YOUR COUNTRY FROM A SOCIALIST TYRANT.
>> Jon: WHO IS THAT?
>> BARACK OBAMA.
>> Jon: BUT HE IS NOT.
HE IS --
>> I KNOW, JON, AND THAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICANS CHANGED THAT.
>> Jon:.
>> DO YOU AGREE THEY WANT TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE?
>> Jon: OF COURSE THEY DO.
>> WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER, JON,
TO DEFEAT A SOCIALIST TYRANT,
HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE RATHER THAN A FUZZY CENTER LEFT LIKEABLE TECHNOCRAT?
>> Jon: SURE, I MEAN THAT IS OBVIOUSLY --
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: BUT THAT WOULD BE A LIE.
>> MILLIONS THEY CHANGED IT,
JON.
>> UNLESS THEY CHANGED IT, JON.
>> THAT IS WHAT LAST NIGHT WAS ABOUT AND FOR GOOD REASON.
REFRAMING THE BROADER DEBATE AS TYRANNICAL DEMOCRATS VERSUS FREEDOM LOVING REPUBLICANS IS
ONE REPUBLICANS CAN WIN.
>> Jon: BUT IT IS NOT THE REAL DEBATE.
>> YES, IT IS, THEY HAVE CHANGED IT!.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING AS LONG AS IT HELPS THEM GET WHAT THEY WANT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT.
>> LET ME TELL YOU A STORY, JON.
LAST NIGHT I MET A VERY ATTRACTIVE AND VERY DRUNK GIRL.
AND LIKE PAUL RYAN, I DELIVERED A SPEECH TO HER ABOUT MY LIFE.
NOW, AM I A PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT ON, OR AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST?
>> Jon: NO.
YOU ARE NOT.
>> TRUE.
BUT DID SHE WAKE UP NEXT TO ME THIS MORNING BEFORE GOING AND TELLING HER FRIENDS THAT SHE
JUST HAD SEX WITH A WAR HERO OLYMPIAN?
>> YES, JON, YES, SHE DID.
AND WHO IS TO SAY THAT HER TRUTH, JON, IS ANY LESS TRUE THAN MINE.
>> Jon: YOU LIED TO HER TO GET HER INTO BED.
>> JON, WHEN SHE SAW ME SHE WAS NOT ATTRACTED TO ME.
I INSTANTLY THOUGHT, WE CAN CHANGE THAT.
SO I TOLD HER A SERIES OF FACTS THAT WERE NOT ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE
MUCH LARGER TRUTH THAT I WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.
>> Jon: THAT IS HORRIBLE.
>> WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE, JON,
IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD SEX WITH HER!
>> Jon: YOU ARE A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE PERSON.
>> DEBT USN'T MATTER, JON.
I CAN CHANGE THAT!
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK
