>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE'VE GOT A GOOD PROGRAM FORYOU TONIGHT.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE DOINGTONIGHT.
THIS IS INTERESTING.
THE GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERYEXCITED, FORMER SECRETARY OF
STATE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE ONOUR PROGRAM TONIGHT.
SHE'S HERE.
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING,THOUGH, SHE IS HERE SOLELY FOR
ONE REASON: TO PUBLICLY ANDDEFINITIVELY DECLARE HER
CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]SHE... TONIGHT... NO.
I THINK.
[LAUGHTER]IF NOT, THIS IS AN ABJECT
FAILURE.
IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN -- MYCAREER AS A JOURNALIST MAY BE
OVER.
BUT, LET'S GET TO OUR TOP STORYTONIGHT, AMERICA'S IMMIGRATION
CRISIS KID EDITION.
>> SINCE OCTOBER, 52,000UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN
PICKED UP TRYING TO CROSS INTOTHE U.S.
>> WHAT'S DRIVING THESE PEOPLENORTH IS CRIPPLING POVERTY AND
OUT-OF-CONTROL VIOLENCE INPLACES LIKE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA
AND EL SALVADOR.
>> Jon: WOW, THERE ARE KIDS INTROUBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT BY MYPARENTS TO FOLLOW THE GOLDEN
RULE.
WHENEVER YOU SEE KID IN TROUBLE,YELL AT THEM IN A LANGUAGE
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
>> GO HOME!
>> NOT OUR KIDS. NOT OURPROBLEM.
>> IF OBAMA LIKES THEM SO MUCH,LET THEM STAY AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THAT IS AN INTERESTING
SUGGESTION.
ALTHOUGH A GROWN MAN INVITINGTHOUSANDS OF KIDS TO HIS HOUSE
GIVES OFF A LITTLE BIT OF ANEVERLAND RANCH VIBE.
[LAUGHTER]ALL RIGHT.
SO LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE THESECOUNTRIES DEVELOPED PROBLEMS
OVERNIGHT.
WHY THE SUDDEN KID-SPLOSION?
>> REPUBLICANS POINT TO THEPRESIDENT'S 2012 ORDER THAT
PROTECTS SOME CHILDREN FROMDEPORTATION, BUT THAT APPLIES
ONLY TO THOSE WHO ENTER THEUNITED STATES BEFORE 2007.
>> Jon: [BLEEPED].
IF I HAVE TOLD KIDS FLEEINGVIOLENCE AND POVERTY ONCE, I'VE
TOLD THEM A THOUSAND TIMES.
IMMIGRANT MINORS SEEKING ASYLUMPOST-2007 MUST APPLY AT THEIR
CONSULATE WITH FORM N-400AND A BIOMETRICS FEE.
THEN APPEAR FOR A SERIES OFPROCESSING INTERVIEWS
TO ASCERTAIN PRIORITYDETERMINATION UNLESS THEY
HAVE FAMILY LIVING IN THEUNITED STATES,
IN WHICH CASE THEYFILE FORM I-130.
AND THEN YOU FILE FORM DS-260UNDER YOUR NVC CASE NUMBER
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU HAVESKILLS ATTRACTIVE TO AN
EMPLOYER. WELL, DO YOU?
DO YOU!
CHILD-FLEEING VIOLENCE ANDPOVERTY, BECAUSE IF YOU
DO, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GOWITH FORM I-140.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT.
CHILD.
NOW, YOU MAY BE WONDERING, IFTHEY DIDN'T FILL OUT THE FORMS,
CAN'T WE JUSTDEPORT THESE KIDS?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT THE[BLEEPED] IS WRONG WITH YOU?
THESE ARE CHILDREN.
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT?
AND SECOND OF ALL, GOODQUESTION.
[LAUGHTER]WHY CAN'T WE JUST DEPORT THEM.
>> A 2008 LAW SIGNED BYPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAYS
CHILDREN FROM COUNTRIES NOTBORDERING THE U.S. CANNOT BE
IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED.
>> Jon: STUPID LIBERALS.
[LAUGHTER]THAT'S WHY WE NEED A REPUBLICAN
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND...OH.
WELL, SINCE WE APPARENTLY HAVE APROCESS IN PLACE, WHY ALL THE
HULLABALOO?
>> THEY CAN APPEAR IN COURT ANDMAKE THE CASE FOR STAYING.
>> TENS OF THOUSANDS OFUNDOCUMENTED AND OFTEN
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN AREOVERWHELMING FEDERAL FACILITIES.
>> Jon: WELL, OF COURSE, THEAGENTS AT THE BORDER PATROL ARE
DOING WHAT THEY CANTO HELP THESE KIDS.
>> I'VE WATCHED THEM DOEVERYTHING FROM CHANGE DIAPERS
TO HEAT FORMULA.
MANY OF THESE ARE SINGLE YOUNGMEN WHO ARE NOT PARTICULARLY
GOOD AT THAT, BUT THEY'RE REALLYGETTING BETTER.
>> Jon: IT'S ALL GOING TO BEDOCUMENTED IN THE NEW HIT MOVIE
"THREE MEN AND 50,000 BABIES."
[LAUGHTER]STEVE... ONE OF THEM, IS THAT...
GUTTENBERG'S BACK, BABY.
SO WE GOT OURSELVES A GENUINEHUMANITARIAN CRISIS, UNLESS
SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO LABEL ITDIFFERENTLY?
>> THE OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARYDEFINES INVASION AS ANY
ENCROACHMENT OR INTRUSION ORADVENT OF SOMETHING HARMFUL AS
IN A DISEASE.
>> Jon: AH, REPRESENTATIVE LOUIEGOHMERT.
HE'S LIKE OLD FAITHFUL,IF INSTEAD OF HOT WATER, IT
REGULARLY SHOT OUT STUPID.
>> IN THE CONSTITUTION UNDERARTICLE 1 SECTION 8, IT SAYS
THAT CONGRESS HAS THE AUTHORITYTO CALL FOR THE MILITARY DURING
TIMES OF INVASION.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YOU WANT THE MARINES
ON THIS ONE?
TIP OF THE SPEAR.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, I'M NOT A MILITARYEXPERT OBVIOUSLY, BUT GENERALLY
AN ENEMY INVASION FORCE IS NOTPARTICULARLY DANGEROUS UNTIL IT
CAN REACH AND OPEN ITS OWNCEREAL.
[LAUGHTER]NOW, FROM WHAT I KNOW...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]EVEN HITLER WASN'T ALWAYS AN
IMMINENT THREAT.
[LAUGHTER]ACTUALLY, THAT'S SOMEONE WHO
[LAUGHTER]ACTUALLY, THAT'S SOMEONE WHO
WORKS HERE'S CHILD. NO, I KNOW.I'M JUST,
I'M WAITING FOR THE DAY WHENTHAT KID, 20 YEARS FROM NOW,
JUST HUNTS ME DOWN, COMES TO MYDOOR AND GOES, YEAH, IT'S REAL
[BLEEPED] FUNNY.
YEAH, THAT WAS REAL, REAL FUNNY.
ANYWAY, SO HUMANITARIAN CRISIS,RESPONSE SYSTEM OVERWHELMED.
WHERE HAVE WE SEEN THIS BEFORE?
THIS UH...ANYBODY, ANYBODY?
OH, YOU, FELLOW LONE STARREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN BLAKE
FARENTHOLD?
>> THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'SKATRINA.
>> WELL, I BELIEVE IN THIS CASEIT'S PRONOUNCED KATARINA.
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, WHEN ITCOMES TO GLARING GAPS IN WHAT
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SECUREBARRIERS, I THINK FARENTHOLD
KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
IN FACT, OH, MY GOD, HANG ON.
THE CRISIS IS SO BAD THEY'REEVERYWHERE.
NOOOOOO!
DONDE ESTA?
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BE SO QUICKTO BLAME OBAMA FOR THIS FLOOD OF
IMMIGRANTS.
MAYBE THEY GOT THE IDEA THATAMERICA WAS A GREAT PLACE TO
COME FROM SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WE LIVE IN THE GREATESTCOUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
>> THE GREATEST NATION IN THEHISTORY OF MANKIND.
>> THE STRONGEST, FREEST,GREATEST COUNTRY.
>> THE GREATEST HEALTH CARE.
>> THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES.
THE GREATEST SCHOOLS.
>> THE GREATEST RISE OF FREEDOMAND OPPORTUNITY.
>> GREATER THAN SOLOMON'SISRAEL.
>> THE SINGLE GREATEST NATION INTHE HISTORY OF ALL MANKIND.
>> THE GREATEST COUNTRY EVER.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUTYOU, BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE
[BLEEPED] AN APPLE PIE RIGHTNOW.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WHY WOULD YOU NOT... WHY WOULD
YOU NOT COME TO A PLACE THATGREAT?
IN FACT, IT'S WHY ALL OF OURANCESTORS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY
AND WERE THEMSELVES ORIGINALLYUNWELCOME.
BECAUSE THAT'S THE STORY OFAMERICA, FROM BEN FRANKLIN'S
WORRIES THAT GERMANS WERERUINING PENNSYLVANIA, TO OUR
19th CENTURY 60-YEAR BAN ONTHE CHINESE IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD
JUST FINISHED BUILDING OUR RAILSYSTEM, TO OUR VERY REAL AND
JUSTIFIABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIRISH AND THEIR INSATIABLE
APPLYING FOR JOBS.
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION OFIMMIGRANTS WHO HATE THE NEWER
IMMIGRANTS.
BECAUSE LADY LIBERTY MAY APPEARTO BE A BEACON TO THOSE YEARNING
TO BREATHE FREE, BUT THE TRUTHIS SHE'S ACTUALLY A BOUNCER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
