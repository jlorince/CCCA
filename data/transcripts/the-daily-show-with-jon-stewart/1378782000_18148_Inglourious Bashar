WELL, THERE'S STILL ONEPERSON WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM
IN THE SYRIA BOMBING DEBATE.
THE PERSPECTIVE BOMBEE,THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE IN
OUR NEW SEGMENT, WHAT IS THEGUY WE'RE THINKING OF
BOMBING THINK ABOUT USBOMBING HIM?
YES, SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHARAL ASSAD SAT DOWN WITH CHARLIE
ROSE FOR AN INTERVIEW ABOUTTHE VERY SUBJECT.
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I WILLWRITE DOWN WHAT I THINK HE
IS GOING TO SAY ABOUT USBOMBING HIM.
>> WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN THISFOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND A
HALF, IT IS GOING TO GETWORSE WITH ANY STRIKE OF
STUPID WAR.
>> OH, HE'S AGAINST IT.
I HAD DOWN PLEASE BOMB ME.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S SO WEIRD.
FOR SOME REASON IT DIDN'TCOME OUT WRITTEN WITH THE
INK OF THE PEN I'M HOLDING.
(LAUGHTER)I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT.
BUT I-- DIDN'T.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HEARASSAD'S ARGUMENTS AGAINST
BOMBING.
>> THIS IS THE WAR HAS COMETO SUPPORT AL QAEDA AND THE
SAME PEOPLE THAT KILLAMERICANS IN THE 11th OF
SEPTEMBER.
>> Jon: OH, DON'T BOMB METHAT WOULD HELP AL QAEDA, SO.
MAYBE WE WANT TO HELP[BLEEP].
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT A PRETTYGOOD POINT THERE.
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE EVIDENCEAGAINST YOU?
>> SECRETARY KERRY HAS SAIDTHERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE
ROCKETS WERE FIRED FROM A REGIONCONTROLLED BY YOUR FORCES.
>> THAT REMINDS ME ABOUTWHAT KERRY SAID ABOUT THE
BIG LIE THAT COLIN POWELLSAID IN FRONT OF THE WORLD
ON SATELLITE ABOUT THE WMDIN IRAQ BEFORE GOING WAR,
WHEN HE SAID THIS IS OUREVIDENCE.
ACTUALLY, HE GETS FALSEEVIDENCE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YOU NEEDLESSLY
INVADE ONE COUNTRY BASED ONFALSE EVIDENCE.
SUDDENLY YOU'RE BAD AT WAR.
WE'VE HAD A VERY SOLID WARCAREER, VERY SOLID, BETWEEN
40 TO 60% JUSTIFIED.
BUT ALL ANYBODY WANTS TOTALK ABOUT IS THE MOST
RECENT ONE OF THE WRONG ONES.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE THE BILLBUCKNER OF SUPERPOWERS NOW.
ANYWHERE WE GO IN THE WORLD,EVERYBODY'S LIKE ANN-THRAX.
ANN-THRAX.
AND THAT WASN'T THE WORSTPART.
ASSAD EVEN USED OUR OWNSYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY AGAINST
US.
>> I THINK IT'S MOSTIMPORTANT PART OF THIS NOW
IS LET'S SAY THE AMERICANPEOPLE,
THE POLLS SHOW THAT THEMAJORITY NOW DON'T
WANT A WAR ANYWHERE, NOTONLY AGAINST SYRIA.
>> Jon: WHAT KIND OF BALLSDOES A RUTHLESS DICTATOR
HAVE TO CITE PUBLIC OPINIONPOLLS.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO
SLOW DOWN THERE, MR. GALLUP,PRETTY SURE GASSING YOUR OWN
PEOPLE AIN'T HITTING DOUBLEDIGITS EITHER.
BUT OF COURSE ASSAD'S ORALARGUMENT FAILS TO PERSUADE
THERE ARE ALWAYS THREATS.
>> WILL THERE BE ATTACKSAGAINST AMERICAN BASES IN
THE MIDDLE EAST IF THERE ISAN AIR STRIKE.
>> YOU SHOULD EXPECTEVERYTHING.
YOU SHOULD EXPECTEVERYTHING.
>> Jon: EXPECT EVERYTHING.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S ASSAD, IS HE
THREATENING US OR PITCHING ANEW TOURISM SLOGAN.
(LAUGHTER)DREAMS ARE ATTAINABLE.
SYRIA, EXPECT EVERYTHING.
