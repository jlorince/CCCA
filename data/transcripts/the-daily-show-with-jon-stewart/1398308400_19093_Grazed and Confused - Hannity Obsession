>> OFFICIALS HAVE CITED THEPOLICE TACTIC AS BEING
INSTRUMENTAL IN REDUCINGMAJOR CRIME IN THE BIG APPLE.
AS SOON AS THEY STARTED IT,MURDER RATES, CRIME WENT DOWN.

BLACK AND BROWN.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
>> I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TIETHE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
>> Jon: AH! CAN'T TIE THE HANDSOF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
SEAN HANNITY WILL NOT ALLOW THISNATION'S LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS TO HAVE THEIR HANDSTIED WHEN THEY NEED THEM TO
FRISK THE BROWN PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]BROWN COWS, ON THE OTHER HAND --

RIGHTS.

>> YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT JONSTEWART HAD A QUOTE RALLY TORESTORE
SANITY.
HE INVITED ALL OF HIS FRIENDS TOATTEND INCLUDING THIS SINGER.

HE HAS SINCE CHANGED HIS NAME TOYUSUF ISLAM. THERE'S ONE PROBLEM
WITH INVITING MR. ISLAM TO ARALLY AIMED AT RESTORING
SANITY, OH THAT'S THE SAMEISLAM WHO INFAMOUSLY IS
UNAPOLOGETIC FOR ENDORSING AFATWA MEANING "TO KILL" A
NOVELIST BY THE NAME OFSALMAN RUSHDIE.

GIVE YOU THAT ONE. SEE, IWANTED HIM TO PLAY PEACE TRAIN
SO THAT OZZY OSBOURNE COULDCUT HIM OFF WITH CRAZY TRAIN
AND THEN THE O'JAYS COME IN ANDTHEY END IT WITH LOVE TRAIN.
IT WAS A GOOD BIT.

GUY, BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISEDHOW FEW NON-FATWA MUSICIANS HAVE
DONE TRAIN BASED SONGS AND WEREAVAILABLE THAT WEEKEND.
BUT CORRECT, CORRECT MR.HANNITY, MISTAKE.

GUY TO MAKE THE GUILT BYMUSICIAN ASSOCIATION POINT.
>> OBAMA, HE'S A PIECE OF(bleep). AND I TOLD HIM TO SUCK
ON MY MACHINE GUN. I SAID HEYHILLARY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO RIDE
ONE OF THESE INTO THE SUNSET,YOU WORTHLESS (bleep).

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE][LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NOW BELIEVE IT OR NOT,I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE CAT
STEVENS FATWA THING WHEN WEBOOKED HIM BUT YOU LITERALLY
WENT FROM A TAPE OF TED NUGENTSAYING THAT (bleep) TO
THAT WAS FRIEND OFSHOW TED NUGENT.
I WILL SAY THIS, THOUGH, FOR ALLTHE DISINGENUOUS,
HYPOCRITICAL, NONFACTUALCORROSIVE, HACKEY WORD TERDS
THAT YOU SPEAK --
[LAUGHTER]-- YOU DID GET ONE THING RIGHT.
>> STEWART WENT INTO HIS TAPEARSENAL WHICH BY THE WAY
SERVE AS AS MORE PROOF.REMEMBER HE WAS
BEGGING ME TO STAY IN NEW YORK,HE IS KIND OF OBSESSED WITH THIS
PROGRAM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: YES!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I AM OBSESSED.
I AM OBSESSED WITH YOUR PROGRAM.
YOU CAN SAY TRUE THINGS.
I AM  OBSESSED WITH YOUR PROGRAMIN THE SAME WAY I AM OBSESSED
WITH ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANTSUPERBUGS OR THE PACIFIC
GARBAGE PATCH OR THE KFC DOUBLEDOWN
BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T BELIEVETHAT IN THIS DAY IN AGE WITH
ALL THAT WE KNOW THIS (bleep)IS OUT THERE.
THAT HUMANITY -- HUMANITY --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THAT OUR SOCIETY IS STILLWEIGHED DOWN BY THESE BURDENS OF
A SEEMINGLY MORE MEDIEVAL TIME,LIKE YOUR SHOW.
TO SEE IT NIGHT AFTER NIGHTSERVING UP THE SAME (bleep).
MY GOD, YOU ARE THE ARBY'S OFNEWS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HOW CAN I NOT BE OBSESSED WITH
THE ARBY'S OF NEWS.
ARBY'S THE HANNITY OF ROAST BEEFSANDWICHES.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS
THE PARADOX AT THE HEART OF YOURSHOW, THAT YOUR PURELY BLIND
PARTISAN IMPULSES ARE COUCHED INSUCH LOFTY PRINCIPLE.
EVERYTHING FRAMED IN TERMS OFTHE POWER OF YOUR PATRIOTISM.
YOU'VE GOT THE FLAG PINS, YOUGOT THE BACKDROPS.
YOU GOT THE GRAPHICS.
THE PATRIOTIC BALL COZIES YOUSELL ON YOUR  WEB SITE AND
YET, YOU, THE --
WHAT? THEY ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE.
THEY ARE MADE IN MALAYSIA.
YET, YOU, THE UBER-AMERICAN,THIS MAN IS YOUR CAUSE.
>> I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE UNITEDSTATES GOVERNMENT AS EVEN
EXISTING.
>> Jon: HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZEAMERICA'S EXISTENCE.
HE IS U.S.-ATHEIST BECAUSE THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES EXIST.
IN FACT, IT WAS CREATED BY THOSEGUYS
AND THAT DOCUMENT YOULOVE SO, SO MUCH.
>> THE BEAUTY OF, I THINK, OURFRAMERS AND THE FOUNDERS IS THEY
PUT IN PLACE THIS DOCUMENT WHERETHEY HAD THE ABILITY TO RIGHT
WRONGS AND CORRECT INJUSTICES.
>> RIGHT.
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLYWANT A RETURN TO FIRST
PRINCIPLES AND CONSTITUTIONALGOVERNMENT.
>> I LOVE WASHINGTON BECAUSE HEGAVE UP POWER.
AMAZING TO ME WHEN HE COULD HAVEHELD ON TO IT.
>> WASHINGTON. NOW THERE'S AFOUNDING FATHER WHO COULD FOUND
THE (bleep) OUT OF EVERYONE.
>> HOW DO YOU THINK HE WOULDHANDLE AN ARMED GROUP OF FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT REJECTIONISTS WHOWOULDN'T PAY THEIR TAXES?
WELL, WE DON'T REALLY NEED TOSPECULATE BECAUSE IT WAS CALLED
THE WHISKEY REBELLION,AND WASHINGTON WITH HIS FEDERAL
ARMY CRUSHED IT IN 1794, I GUESS
WOULD YOU SAYDISPROPORTIONALLY.
AND THE REASON THAT HE WASLEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT
WAS BECAUSE A MAN NAMED DANIELSHAYS PULLED THE SAME (bleep) IN
1786 AND 1787.
THAT'S HIM APPARENTLY ROLLINGDOWN A HILL.
SO THE FOUNDING FATHERS CALLEDTHE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
TO FORM A MUCH STRONGER FEDERALGOVERNMENT THAT COULD COLLECT
TAXES BY FORCE IF NECESSARYWHICH I GUESS MAKES YOU,
SEAN HANNITY, NOT AN AMERICANPATRIOT BUT AN
ANTI-FEDERALIST OR TO BE KIND
LET'S JUST SAY YOU LOVE THEFOUNDING FATHERS BUT ONLY THEIR
EARLY WORK BEFORE THEY SOLD OUTAND BECAME THE MAN OR MEN OR
WHITE PROPERTY OWNING MEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
