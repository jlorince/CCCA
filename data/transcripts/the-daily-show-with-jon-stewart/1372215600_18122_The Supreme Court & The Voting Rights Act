>> WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
I AM JOHN OLIVER, JON
STEWART STILL NOT HERE.
HE IS CURRENTLY WALKING
ACROSS THE GRAND CANYON.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE
ROOST, THE GREAT QUEST LOVE
IS WITH US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO IT
TONIGHT.
HUGE NEWS THIS MORNING OUT
OF THE SUPREME COURT.
>> THE SUPREME COURT JUST A
SHORT TIME AGO STRUCK DOWN A
KEY PART OF THE VOTING
RIGHTS ACT.
NOW THIS PART DETERMINES
WHICH STATES MUST ACTUALLY
GET FEDERAL PERMISSION
BEFORE THEY CHANGE THEIR
VOTING LAWS.
>> OKAY, BASICALLY THE KEY
PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS
ACT THEY REMOVED WAS THE ONE
THAT APPLIED STRICT SCRUTINY
TO STATES WITH A PREVIOUS
HISTORY OF RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION, THOSE STATES,
OF COURSE, BEING WHITE
SYLVANIA, PALE-AFORNIA, CAW
CARIACUT, AND MISSISSIPPI.
BUT LOOK, LOOK--
(APPLAUSE)
THIS IS CLEARLY A VERY BOLD
MOVE FROM THE SUPREME COURT
THIS WAS A LANDMARK PIECE OF
CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION.
I HOPE THAT CHIEF JUSTICE
ROBERTS HAS A PRETTY
COMPELLING REASON TO GET RID
OF IT.
>> IN HIS OPINION CHIEF
JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS WROTE
OUR COUNTRY HAS CHANGED.
>> OH, THAT'S FINE THEN,
THAT'S FINE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S ALL.
WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD THEN.
BECAUSE IT HAS CHANGED.
WE HAVE GOT iPADS, TWITTER,
MAXI PADS WITH WINGS.
(LAUGHTER)
EVERY ONE IS ALLERGIC TO BRE
NOW-- BREAD NOW AND RACIALLY
THINGS HAVE GOT BETTER IN
THE SOUTH.
IT'S TRUE, PRIMARILY BECAUSE
OF THINGS LIKE, OH, I DON'T
KNOW, THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT
OF 1965.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
INTERESTING STORY.
THAT'S THE PIECE OF
LEGISLATION THAT NOW HAS A
HOLE OF IT THE EXACT SHAPE
OF JOHN ROBERTS MIDDLE
FINGER.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW YOU MIGHT THINK, YOU
KNOW, IT'S SO OLD, THE
VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
IT'S PROBABLY OBSOLETE.
WHEN DOES THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT EVER NEED TO
PROTECT MINORITY VOTERS FOR
INVOKING SECTION 5.
AND THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY
NEVER IF BASICALLY NEVER
MEANS, AND THIS IS TRUE, 74
TIMES SINCE THE YEAR 2000.
AND JUST IN CASE YOU NEEDED
A REMINDER OF WHAT THE
VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS
PREVENTING, LESS THAN TWO
HOURS AFTER THE SUPREME
COURT'S RULING, ONE OF THE
STATES FLAGGED IN THE VOTING
RIGHTS ACT DID THIS.
>> IN TEXAS THEY HAVE TWO
ISSUES RIGHT NOW, THE
REDISTRICTING CASE AND THE
MOST RESTRICTIVE VOTER-- IN
THE COUNTRY.
THEY ANNOUNCED TODAY THEY
ARE GOING TO START
IMPLEMENTING THOSE TOMORROW.
>> TWO HOURS!
THEY COULDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR
TWO HOURS.
IT TAKES TEXAS LESS TIME TO
DISENFRANCHISE MINORITY
VOTERS THAN IT TAKES FOR
THEM TO BARBECUE A PIG.
