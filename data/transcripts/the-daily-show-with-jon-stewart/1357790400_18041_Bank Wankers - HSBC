>> Jon: WELCOME OWE TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
ANY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE WONDERFUL JEFF BRIDGES IS GOING TO BE JOINING US.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PAST FEW NIGHTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HEAVY, COMPLEX DIFFICULT TO SOLVE
ISSUES LIKE GUN CONTROL, THE FISCAL GIVE.
GIRARD DEPARDU'S HEARD BREAKING-REALLY HEARTBREAKING -- FROM HIS BELOVED FRANCE.
HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE THE PIXAR CHARACTER OF HIMSELF, DOES HE NOT?
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN WITH A LITTLE PIECE WE CALL.
♪ ♪ DISGRACED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO REAL HARD TO MAKE (bleep) FUN.
YOU KNOW THAT BANK HSBC IT TURNS OUT THE INITIALS STAND FOR HOLY (bleep) BANKRUPT.
>> HSBC IS ACCUSED OF TRANSFERRING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR NATIONS LIKE IRAN, DOING
BUSINESS WITH FIRMS LINKED TO TERRORISM AND ENABLING MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS TO MOVE MONEY
THROUGH U.S. SUB SID DAIRIES.
>> Jon: MONEY LAUNDERING WITH DRUG CARTELS AND TERRORIST GROUPS.
I AM SURPRISED THAT THOSE PEOPLE WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH BANKERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY HAVE STANDARDS.
BANKER SLAM!
TURLEY AN INDUSTRY POPULATED WITH A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE.
I DON'T WANT TO BE SO HARD ON THESE GUYS.
YOU KNOW?
THEY DID BUSINESS WITH TERRORISTS AT THE BANK.
EVERYBODY WALKED IN.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO.
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WERE WORKING WITH AND COUNSELING ENEMIES ON HOW TO CIRCUMVENT THE ENTIRE
SECURITY APRIL RAT RUSS.
>> ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION HSBC TAUGHT THEM HOW TO FORMAT MESSAGES SO TRANSACTIONS WOULD
NOT BE BLOCKED BY THE UNITED STATES.
>> Jon: ARE YOU (bleep) KIDDING ME?
THEY WORKED PERSONALLY WITH THESE PEOPLE TO HELP THEM -- THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.
I CANNOT BELIEVE OUR NATION'S ENEMIES ARE GETTING BETTER AND MORE PERSONAL BANK CUSTOMER
SERVICE THAN I AM.
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO TRANSFER TO HSBC.
WE CAN TAKE SOLIDS.
AT LEAST THE HSBC GUYS THEY ARE GOING TO SEND THEM UP THE RIVER TO THE BIG HOUSE.
>> NOT ONE PERSON FROM HSBC WILL FACE PROSECUTION.
THERE'S NO CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST ANY OF THE MANAGERS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO LEWD THIS TO GO ON.
>> Jon: YEAH, NO, OBVIOUSLY RIVER IS THE BIG HOUSE.
BY RIVER I MEAN THE SAME AND BY BIG HOUSE I MEAN A MANSION ON IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL UNSATISFYING RISK PUNISHMENT HERE.
>> THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TOMORROW THAT EUROPE'S BIGGEST BANK HSBC
WILL PAY $1.9 BILLION TO SETTLE MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES.
>> Jon: OH, WOW.
$1.9 BILLION.
I MEAN THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM WEEKS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
TO PAY DOWN.
WHY EXACTLY NO PROSECUTION?
>> THE BANK'S LAWYERS HAVE ARGUED THAT A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF HSBC COULD HAVE
PUT THE BANK OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE U.S. COSTING LOTS OF JOBS AND DISRUPTING FINANCIAL MARKETS.
>> U.S. OFFICIALS APPARENTLY AGREED THAT MANY MANY WAYS HSBC BECAME SIMPLY TOO TBOIG PROSECUTE.
>> Jon: WAIT THAT -- THAT'S A THING?
YOU CAN GET TOO BIG TO -- YOUR ORGANIZATION CAN REACH A CERTAIN SIZE AND IMPORTANCE IN THIS
COUNTRY THAT IT GRANTS YOU IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION?
YOU SOMEHOW SHOOT THE LEGAL MOON IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
THESE ARE HORRIFIC CRIMES BUT SINCE YOUR BANK AVES ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I
AM NOT GOING TO WALK FIVE (bleep) BLOCKS TO A BODEGA
