SO WHILE THE PRESIDENT JETS
AROUND WITH HIS CASH VACUUM
OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE
THEY'RE STILL DUKING IT OUT
AMONGST THEMSELVES.
AND THE PRIMARY SEASON HAS
NOW SHIFTED TO MICHIGAN
WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WAB A
CAKE WALK FOR MITT ROMNEY.
HE GREW UP THERE.
HIS FATHER WAS GOVERNOR
THERE.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, HE'S NAMED
FOR THE SHAPE OF MICHIGAN.
THE MITT.
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, MUCH LUCKIER
THAN HIS FLORIDA-BORN
BROTHER WILLARD [BLEEP]
ROMNEY.
OBVIOUSLY A [BLEEP] FAMILY
NICKNAME.
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION ON
THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN
INTERESTING ONE.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE [BLEEP]
JOKE.
OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE
PROBLEM.
ROMNEY MAY FACE IN MICHIGAN.
>> IN 2008 ROMNEY WROTE IN
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" LET
DETROIT GO BANKRUPT.
>> Jon: SUBTITLED SERIOUSLY,
DETROIT CAN [BLEEP].
LUCKILY, I REALLY HOPE THE
TV IN THE GREEN ROOM IS OFF.
LUCKILY MITT ROMNEY HAS
UNLEASHED A BRILLIANT NEW AD
CAMPAIGN TO MAKE MICHIGAN
VOTERS FORGET THAT ENTIRE
ARTICLE.
>> I GREW UP IN MICHIGAN.
IT WAS EXCITING TO BE HERE.
I REMEMBER GOING TO THE
DETROIT AUTO SHOW WITH MY
DAD.
THAT WAS A BIG DEAL.
PEOPLE HERE IN DETROIT ARE
DISTRESSED.
I WANT TO MAKE MICHIGAN
STRONGER AND BETTER.
MICHIGAN'S BEEN MY HOME AND
THIS IS PERSONAL.
>> Jon: WOW, WHAT
A-- POWERFUL AND EMOTIONAL
WAY TO CONNECT TO YOUR HOME
TOWN.
I-- OF COURSE LIKE ALL
THINGS ROMNEY THERE ARE SOME
CAVIARS, I'M SORRY, CAVEATS.
AS IT TURNS OUT, THAT PHOTO
IN THE AD OF ROMNEY AND HIS
DAD AT THE DETROIT AUTO SHOW
IS ACTUALLY HIM AND HIS DAD
AT THE 1964 NEW YORK WORLD
FAIR.
WHICH APPARENTLY IN ROMNEY'S
MIND TOOK PLACE IN QUEENS'S
MICHIGAN, AND THE AMERICAN
CAR HE IS DRIVING AROUND IS
A CHRYSLER 300 WHICH IS
MANUFACTURED IN CANADA.
SO AND YOU WON'T BE
SURPRISED HE WASN'T ACTUALLY
DRIVING, HE WAS IN FACT
HIMSELF BEING DRIVEN.
ALL RIGHT, SO--
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS
ISN'T JUST ABOUT ROMNEY'S
WEAKNESS.
IT'S ALSO ABOUT HIS OPPONENT
RICK SANTORUM'S STRENGTH.
HE'S A SERIOUS CONTENDER
NOW.
AND AS WE OURSELVES
RECOGNIZE TWO MONTHS AGO
WHEN I ANNOUNCED ON THIS
PROGRAM WE WOULD NO LONGER
BE MAKING JOKES ABOUT THE
ALTERNATE MEANING OF
SANTORUM'S NAME, YEAH, NO
MATTER HOW TEMPTING IT MAY
BE.
>> RICK SANTORUM'S SURGE IS
SPREADING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THIS MUST COVER
SANTORUM AS A SERIOUS
CANDIDATE, NOT AS A NAME
SAKE FOR STAINING ANAL
LIQUIDES.
OKAY, PERHAPS WE CAN
DISTRACT OURSELVES WITH
SANTORUM'S LATEST
ANTI-ROMNEY CAMPAIGN AD.
>> THIS TIME ROMNEY'S FIRING
HIS MARK AT RICK SANTORUM,
AND A STAGGERING $20 MILLION
SUPPOSEDLY ATTACK SEVERAL
REPUBLICANS.
AND IN THE END, MITT
ROMNEY'S UGLY ATTACKS ARE
GOING TO BACKFIRE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SO MITT ROMNEY
ATTACKS SANTORUM AND ENDS UP
WITH BROWN LIQUID ON HIS
SHIRT.
