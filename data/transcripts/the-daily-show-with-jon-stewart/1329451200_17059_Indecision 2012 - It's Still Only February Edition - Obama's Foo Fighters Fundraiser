HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE NO
TEST BEING THE DIFFERENCE
BUT WE'LL SEE.
HE'S THE SECRETARY OF
EDUCATION, IMAGINE HOW BAD
YOU WOULD HAVE TO MISBEHAVE
IN CLASS TO GET CALLED DOWN
TO HIS OFFICE.
I MEAN THAT, JIMMY F YOU

YOU ON AN AIRPLANE TO
WASHINGTON.
BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
THE PRESIDENT OF THESE
UNITED STATES IN OUR ONGOING

THE PRESIDENT?
WHAT'S UP WITH HIS
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING
HOLLYWOOD.
HE'S RAISING BIG MONEY IN
L.A. RIGHT NOW.
>> THOSE SHELLING OUT
BETWEEN 250 TO 500 TO OFFEND
THEY WILL BE TREATED TO A
FOO FIGHTERS CONCERT.
THE 80 PEOPLE WHO STAYED FOR
DINNER AFTER THE FUND-RAISER,

THEY WILL PAY $35,000.
>> Jon: $35,000-- WHAT?
THAT IS OUTRAGE US, $35,000
FOR A TICKET TO DINNER BUT

THAT IS AN INSULT TO THIS

FILLED WITH FOO.
