THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
THEY ARE NOT BOOING THEY AREMOOKIE-ING.
BUT FIRST THE WOUNDS OFCENTURIES OF RACIAL OPPRESSION
HAVE LONG HAUNTED OUR COUNTRY ATRAGIC BUT INESCAPABLE PART
OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.
UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN THE SUPREMECOURT SAID ITS OKAY FOR STATES
TO BAN AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONPROGRAMS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES
THUS COMPLETING THE MISSION OFRACIAL HEALING THIS COURT
EMBARKED ON LAST YEAR.
>> THE SUPREME COURT ESSENTIALLYKNOCKED DOWN ONE OF PILLARS OF
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
IT INVALIDATED A KEY PART OF THEVOTING RIGHTS ACT, THE LAW
ENACTED IN 1965 TO STOP RACIALDISCRIMINATION AT THE POLLS.
>> AS CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTSSAID NEARLY 50 YEARS LATER
THINGS HAVE CHANGEDDRAMATICALLY.
>> Jon: RACISM IS OVER!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]OF COURSE, THE JUSTICES WEREJUST
CODIFYING WHAT MANY OF US HADKNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
>> AMERICA TREATS PEOPLEEQUALLY.
WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.
EUROPE EVEN HAS NEVER HAD ABLACK PRESIDENT.
>> UNFORTUNATELY FOR LIBERALSTHERE'S NO RACISM IN AMERICA.
THERE'S MORE CHOLERA IN AMERICATHAN THERE IS RACISM.
>> Jon: MORE CHOLERA, YES,RACISM HAS GONE THE WAY OF
(bleep) WHERE YOU DRINK.
THE IMPORTANT THING ISTHAT RACISM IS OFFICIALLY DEAD.
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE MORETHING ABOUT THE KNOW ABOUT THE
NEGRO -->> Jon: WHAT? JUST DAYS AFTER
BEING DECLARED DEAD BY THESUPREME COURT RACISM HAS ARISEN.
IT'S A WEEK AFTER EASTERMIRACLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]NOT THAT EASTER WEEKEND ITSELF
DIDN'T PROVIDE CLUES THATPERHAPS RACISM WASN'T QUITE AS
DEAD AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS.
>> EASTER EGGS FILLED WITH WORDSOF HATE.
>> PARENTS IN THE WEST END AREOUTRAGED AFTER WAKING UP TO FIND
EASTER EGGS FILLED WITH RACISTNOTES.
>> Jon: HUH. ITHOUGHT THE EASTER BUNNY
LOOKED DIFFERENT THIS YEAR. [LAUGHTER]
AND OF COURSE, RACISM LIKE OTHERTHINGS THAT
HAVE BEEN RESURRECTED QUICKLYCAUGHT ON WITH MANY JEWS.
>> DON'T COME TO MY GAMES. DON'TBRING BLACK PEOPLE AND DON'TCOME.
>> IT BOTHERS ME A LOT THAT YOUWANT TO BROADCAST THAT YOU ARE
ASSOCIATING WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
>> I'M JUST SAYING, INYOUR LOUSY (bleep) INSTAGRAMS,YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HAVE YOURSELF WITH,WALKING WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
[AUDIENCE BOOS]>> Jon: THAT IS A DONALD
STERLING. THAT IS DONALDSTERLING. HE'S A BILLIONAIRE WHO
HAS GOTTEN RICH OFF THE LABORS
OF A MOSTLY BLACK BASKETBALLTEAM TELLING HIS
MIXED RACE GIRLFRIEND NOT TOBE SEEN WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
IT'S THAT AGE OLD STORY, "YEAH,I'M RACIST BUT MY (bleep) AND MY
WALLET ARE NOT." BY THE WAY,
[ LAUGHTER ]BEING SEEN WITH BLACK PEOPLE
APPEARS TO BE THE ONLYRESTRICTION STERLING IS PLACING.
>> YOU CAN SLEEP WITH THEM, YOUCAN BRING THEM IN, YOU CAN
DO WHATEVER I WANT.
THE LITTLE I ASK YOU IS NOT TOPROMOTE IT AND NOT TO BRING THEM
TO MY GAMES.
>> Jon: HE IS A RARE CREATURE.
A RACIST SWINGER.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT HE BASICALLY IS SAYING IS I
DON'T SEE COLOR WHO IT COMES TOWHO YOU ARE (bleep).
I ONLY SEE IT WHEN IT COMES TOWHO YOU ARE SITTING WITH.
IF YOU THINK AN OLD MAN TELLINGHIS GIRLFRIEND IT'S COOL IF SHE
BANGS WHOEVER SHE WANTS IS THEWEIRDEST PART OF THIS STORY,
THINK AGAIN.
>> STERLING WAS DUE TO RECEIVE ASECOND LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT
AWARD FROM THE NAACP NEXT MONTHFOR HIS WORK WITH
UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTH BUT ONMEET THE PRESS TODAY THE NAACP
INTERIM PRESIDENT SETTHAT WON'T HAPPEN.
>> Jon: TAKE THAT STERLING.  NOTJOHN STERLING.
JOHN STERLING IS AN THEANNOUNCER OF YANKEES.
DIFFERENT GUYS. THATSTERLING.
BECAUSE OF YOUR UNREPENTENTRACISM YOU ONLY GET ONE
NCAACP LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENTAWARD -- NA DOUBLE C P --
NA DOUBLE -- IT'S REALLYHARD TO SAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]THERE'S ONE MORE THING WE SHOULD
ADD.
>> NO, I'M NOT RACIST BUT I DIDWONDER THAT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR RACE IS.
WE NEED TO GET OVER THISPREJUDICE.
>> STERLING TOGETHER WITH THECLIPPERS ORGANIZATION SAY THE
VIEWS ON THE RECORDINGS DO NOTREFLECT STERLING'S OWN PERSONAL
BELIEFS.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
SOMEONE HAS TO FINALLY STAND UPFOR THESE PEOPLE WHO MAKING
CLEARLY RACIST STATEMENTS ONTAPE AS NOT BEING RACIST.
AND SINCE NO ONE ELSE WILL DO ITIT MIGHT AS WELL BE THE RACISTS
THEMSELVES.
THAT IS THE POT CALLING THEKETTLE A BLENDER.
POT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'VE GOT ME ALL WRONG.
I WOULD NEVER BE BLACK.
