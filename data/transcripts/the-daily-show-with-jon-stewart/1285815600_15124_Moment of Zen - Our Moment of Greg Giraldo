>> Jon: THAT'S OUR
SHOW.
JOIN US TOMORROW AT
11:00.
DIFFICULT NEWS TO
REPORT, OUR GOOD FRIEND
GREG GERALDO PASSED AWAY
TODAY.
COMEDY WORLD LOST A GOOD
MAN AND A GREAT COMIC.
AND HE WAS THE TYPE OF
GUY THAT WHEN YOU WERE
WORKING THE CLUBS, HE
WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE
GUYS THAT YOU LOVED TO
RUN INTO BECAUSE HE WAS
ALWAYS A FONT AND WARMTH
AND GOOD HUMOR AND JUST
SMART AS HELL COMEDY AND
FUN TO WATCH AND FUNNIER
TO HANG OUT WITH.
WE'LL MISS HIM TERRIBLY.
HERE IT IS OUR MOMENTS
OF GREG.
>> THEY BELIEVE HUMANS
ARE CLONES OF EXTRA
TERRESTRIALS.
THAT SOUNDS INSANE,
RIGHT?
IS IT CRAZIER THAN ALL
OF REST OF OUR
RELIGIONS?
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC,
THE VIRGIN MARY?
WE HAVE A WHOLE RELIGION
BASED ON A WOMAN WHO
REALLY STUCK TO HER
STORY.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M SAYING THAT THERE'S
A LEAP OF FAITH THERE,
TOO.
LOOK AT ALL THE
RELIGIONS.
LOOK AT THE JEWS, THE
INSANE THINGS THE JEWS
BELIEVE.
THE JEWS BELIEVE BARBARA
STREISAND IS WORTH
