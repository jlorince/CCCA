>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE GOT A BIG ONE TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MR. TOM
HANKS.
HE IS MAN SO LIKABLE, SO POLITE
THAT HIS NAME ACTUALLY CONTAINS
THE WORD "THANKS."
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S RIGHT IN IT.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
ECONOMY, WHICH, AS MANY OF YOU
ARE AWARE, SUCKS.
[LAUGHTER]
RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO PAY
DOWN $14.3 TRILLION OF DEBT.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
[LAUGHTER]
APPARENTLY I'M READING A SCARY
STORY TO MY CHILDREN.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE
NOISES LIKE IT'S "PETER AND THE
[BLEEPED] WOLF OR SOMETHING."
WE'RE GOING TO PAY DOWN $14.
TRILLION OF DEBT WITH A
ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO PRODUCE
JOBS, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE
AMERICAN WORKERS STILL
STUBBORNLY CLING TO THE IDEA
THAT THEY SHOULD BE MORE HIGHLY
COMPENSATED THAN SAY SUICIDAL
CHINESE COMPUTER PART FACTORY
HELP.
[LAUGHTER]
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH OF THESE
DESPONDENT PEOPLE, WELL, NOT TO
WORRY, PEOPLE.
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW
WORDS ABOUT THE ECONOMY BEFORE I
TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS.
>> Jon: ECONOMY PRESS
CONFERENCE.
HOORAY!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
SO WHAT DO WE DO, BOSS?
>> THE STRUGGLES OF MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILIES WERE A BIG PROBLEM
BEFORE THE RECESSION HIT IN
2007.
THEY WEREN'T CREATED OVERNIGHT,
AND THE TRUTH IS OUR ECONOMIC
CHALLENGES ARE NOT GOING TO BE
SOLVED OVERNIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT BY MONDAY...
[LAUGHTER]
MONDAY?
YOU GOT A PLAN?
>> ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
URGENT THINGS WE CAN DO FOR THE
ECONOMY IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH
PARTIES ARE WORKING ON RIGHT
NOW, AND THAT'S REDUCING OUR
NATION'S DEFICIT.
>> Jon: PHEW.
WELL, THANK GOD WE KNOW WHAT TO
DO, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE
TOO HARD, RIGHT?
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TACKLE
SPENDING IN THE TAX CODE TO MAKE
IT EASIER FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO
PATENT A NEW PRODUCT, REBUILDING
OUR TRANSPORTATION STRUCTURE,
ELIMINATE WASTE, TACKLE
ENTITLEMENT, EXTEND THOSE
MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS, HELP
BUSINESSES CREATE JOBS.
WE GOT TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT, AND
WE HAVE TO SEIZE IT SOON.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT?
OF COURSE, THE FIRST THING
BEFORE WE GET TO ANY OF THAT
STUFF...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S WHY WE GET PAID THE CABLE
MONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
THE FIRST THING WE DO BEFORE WE
GET TO ANY OF THAT GOOD FIXING
THE ECONOMY STUFF, DEMOCRATS SAY
WE HAVE TO RAISE AMERICA'S $14.3
TRILLION DEBT CEILING BEFORE
AUGUST 2nd, BECAUSE IF WE
DON'T DO THAT, UH, WAIT, WHAT
HAPPENS AGAIN?
>> ARMAGEDDON.
>> ARMAGEDDON.
>> ARM GETTEN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NO, THAT WASN'T IT.
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE
RIGHT, TOTAL COLLAPSE OF OUR
ECONOMIC SYSTEM.
BUT THAT'S JUST THE PREREQUISITE
TO ENACTING ANY OF THOSE OTHER
SOLUTIONS THE PRESIDENT WAS
TALKING ABOUT.
I'M SORRY, REPUBLICANS, YOU
WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS.
>> IF ALL WE DO IS EXTEND THE
DEBT LIMIT AND DO NOT START
DEALING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL
FACT THAT THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY IT
DOESN'T HAVE.
>> Jon: YES, NO, NO, NO, I
UNDERSTAND.
ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT...
>> TAX INCREASES ARE OFF THE
TABLE.
>> Jon: OH.
WELL, YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY TWO
WAYS TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT.
YOU CAN CUT SPENDING OR RAISE
TAXES.
YOU TAKE ONE OF THOSE OFF THE
TABLE COMPLETELY, YOU'RE NOT
REALLY NEGOTIATING.
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR LOVE, BUT I WON'T
DO THAT."
YOU REALLY WOULDN'T THEN DO
ANYTHING FOR LOVE.
SO I QUESTIONS WHAT I'M SAYING
IS MEATLOAF'S PREMISE IS FAULTY
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT ARE THE DEMOCRATS
COUNTER-OFFERING?
>> IT ALMOST MAKES YOU WONDER IF
THEY AREN'T TRYING TO SLOW DOWN
THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR
POLITICAL GAIN.
>> Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO WE HAVE, UNTIL AUGUST
2nd BEFORE WE HIT ARMAGEDDON.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU AGREE ON?
>> THEY'RE NOT DEALING IN
REALITY
>> MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS SEEM TO
BE LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD.
>> Jon: OH, ALL RIGHT.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, HARRY
REID, IF THEY'RE LIVING IN A
FANTLY WORLD, WOULD YOU STILL
EXIST?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, ONE THING IS CLEAR,
