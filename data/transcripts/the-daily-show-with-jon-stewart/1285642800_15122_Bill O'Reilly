>> I'M GLAD WE GOT THAT IN
BEFORE THE DRONE.
>> Jon: SETTLE DOWN!
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH HIM.
>> WITH GLENN BECK?
NOBODY CAN.
HE'S IN A SEALED ROOM.
>> Jon: IS HE LIKE THE BUBBLE
BOY OF FOX NEWS?
>> HE DOES THE RADIO.

>> Jon: WHY IS IT SO CORRUPT.
HERE IS WHERE WE CAN COME TO AN
AGREEMENT.
WE MAY NEVER AGREE ON POLICY.
CORRUPTION.
CORRUPTION.
I DON'T LIKE CORRUPT MEDIA.
I DON'T LIKE CORRUPT FINANCES.
I WOULD BE WILLING -- WHAT ARE
THE RIGHT WING TORT REFORM AND
YOU GET TO BUY INSURANCE IN
DIFFERENT STATES.
ALL THAT STUFF IS FINE.
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH
THE CORRUPTION AT THE HEART OF
KNEES PROBLEMS.

[LAUGHTER]
>> OH, LORD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
>> THE CORRUPTION YOU ARE RIGHT.
IT'S A CORRUPT SYSTEM BECAUSE
THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO RAISE MONEY
AND THEY'VE GOT TO -- YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY COMING IN SAID WE'LL
GIVE YOU THIS BUT YOU HAVE TO DO
THAT.
>> Jon: IT'S LIKE AN
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT, THE LOBBYISTS, THE
MEDIA.
>> EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT YOU
DON'T GENERALIZE LIKE.
THAT THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME
RAISING MONEY AND KISSING BUTT
BUT THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT
PROBLEM SOLVING.
THE LIBERAL PINHEADS ARE JUST AS
BAD AS THE RIGHT WING PINHEADS.
>> Jon: NOBODY IS SUGGESTING
THAT PINHEADS OF EITHER SIDE IS
PLEASANT.
>> THE GOOD PEOPLE NUMBER ONE
DON'T WANT TO PUT THEMSELVES
THROUGH THE EXERCISE BECAUSE
THEY GET RIPPED UP BY PEOPLE
LIKE YOU.
>> Jon: I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE
A RALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO
RESTORE SANITY.
WILL YOU COME TO THE RALLY TO
RESTORE SANITY.
COME TO THE RALLY.
COME TO THE RALLY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
COME TO THE RALLY!
ARE YOU COMING?
>> YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK
HERE.
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A
BREAK.
>> WHEN WE COME BACK I'LL TELL
YOU WHY I'M NOT COMING.
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHY I
WANT YOU TO COME?
>> NO.
>> Jon: I WANT TO SEE IF THE
RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY WORKS.
>> YOU AND COLBERT DON'T WANT ME
TO COME BECAUSE IF I COME
THERE'S A BIG CROWD AND YOU
WON'T GET ANY CREDIT.
YOU WANT TO BE ALONE.
LET'S LET STEWART AND COLBERT
STAND ON THEIR OWN FOUR FEET.
THEY DON'T NEED ME.
MAKE SENSE IT'S A HALLOWEEN
THING AND I DON'T HAVE A
COSTUME.
>> Jon: I APPRECIATE YOU
MAKING US PULL US UP BY OUR OWN
BOOTSTRPS.
>> DON'T PIGGY BACK ON ME AND
BECK.
YOU ARE IN ON YOUR OWN.
IF SIX PEOPLE SHOW UP I'M ALL
OVER YOU.
YOU'LL BE ON VACATION FOR A
MONTH.
>> Jon: IF YOU ARE OUT THERE
NOT FOR ME, NOT FOR AMERICA, BUT
TO MAKE HIM EAT HIS WORDS.
