>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FORMER NPRCORRESPONDENT, SENIOR ASSOCIATE
AT THE CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT, HERNEW BOOK IS CALLED "THIEVES OF
STATE:  WHY CORRUPTION THREATENSGLOBAL SECURITY."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMSARAH CHAYES. SARAH! HELLO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU!
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: I'M GOOD!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISDAMN BOOK, "THIEVES OF STATE"
ABOUT CORRUPTION.
I FEEL LIKE CORRUPTION IS THEMOST INSIDIOUS, MOST WIDESPREAD,
LEAST TALKED ABOUT ISSUE IN THE21st CENTURY.
>> SO I GET A LOT OF CRITICISMFOR FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON
CORRUPTION.
>> Jon: OH, THEN I AGREE WITHTHAT, THEN.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID DID I SAY?
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE ONLYCAUSE OF ALL THE CRISES THAT WE
HAVE BEEN SEEING IN THELAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
>> Jon: YES.
>> I THINK IT'S ONE OF THECAUSES, AND IT'S THE ONE THAT
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> SO THAT'S WHY I WROTE"THIEVES OF STATE" ABOUT
BASICALLY THIS ONE ISSUE.
>> Jon: NOW THIS FOCUSES,OBVIOUSLY, ON A LOT OF YOUR
EXPERIENCE IN AFGHANISTAN OVERTHE PAST -- YOU LIVED THERE NINE
YEARS OR A DECADE.
>> A DECADE. YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT I THINK THE MOSTINTERESTING THING ABOUT IT IS
THE CONNECTION YOU MAKE BETWEENWHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER
CORRUPTION, AND NOT NECESSARILYLIKE, YOU KNOW, CARICATURE MONEY
IN A BRIEFCASE CORRUPTION WHICHEXISTS, BUT THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN CORRUPTION ANDEXTREMISTS.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
AND SOME OF IT IS MONEY IN ABRIEFCASE.
AND I THINK THERE ARE TWOASPECTS OF CORRUPTION, THE KIND
OF CORRUPTION THAT I'M TALKINGABOUT THAT A LOT OF
AMERICANS DON'T GET.
ONE IS IT'S REALLY IN YOUR FACE.
THIS IS NOT SOME, YOU KNOW,VICTIMLESS THING HAPPENING THAT
YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THIS IS THE COP SHAKES YOUDOWN NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE, FIVE
TIMES.
IF YOU DON'T FORK OVER, HE MIGHTHIT YOU.
HE -- NOT ONLY IS HE STEALINGYOUR MONEY, HE'S INSULTING YOU
WHILE HE'S DOING IT.
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE COP.
IT'S THE NURSERY SCHOOL TEACHER.
I HAVE A FRIEND IN NIGERIA WHOSAID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T PAY
THE NURSERY SCHOOL TEACHER, SHEDOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR
CHILD AND YOUR CHILD IS CRANKY.
IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO BEHAPPY, YOU HAVE TO PAY OFF THE
NURSERY SCHOOL TEACHER.
IT'S IN YOUR FACE EVERY SINGLEDAY,
AND SO THAT MAKES PEOPLE MAD.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
NOW THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS TOCOME IN.
SO YOU HAVE THIS IDEA THATGOVERNMENT OR THE INSTITUTIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE BYTHE POWERFUL DO NOT WORK FOR YOU
IN ANY WAY?
>> NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT WORK FORYOU, THEY WORK AGAINST YOU
ACTIVELY.
>> Jon: YES. THEY WORK AGAINSTYOU.
>> SO WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE A THIRDOF IRAQ WAS WILLING TO BE OPEN
TO THE LUNATICS THAT CALLTHEMSELVES THE ISLAMIC STATE?
IT WAS SO BAD, THE MALIKIGOVERNMENT WAS SO BAD AND THERE
WAS ABSOLUTELY NO RECOURSE,PEOPLE STARTED TO SAY, YOU KNOW,
SIX OF ONE, HALF DOZEN OF THEOTHER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THAT'S ONE PIECE OF ITTHAT I THINK AMERICANS DON'T
REALLY GET.
AND THE REASON EXTREMISTMOVEMENTS I THINK ARE ATTRACTIVE
TO PEOPLE IN THIS SITUATION, TWOTHINGS, ONE IS IT OFFERS AN
EXPLANATION.
WHY IS OUR GOVERNMENT SOOBNOXIOUS?
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWINGRELIGIOUS STRICTURES.
>> Jon: THEY'RE NOT PURE.
>> THEY'RE NOT PURE. THEY'RE NOT--
THEY'RE MORALLY DEPRAVED AS WELLAS MATERIALLY DEPRAVED.
>> Jon: YES.
>> SO THE ONLY WAY YOU CANACHIEVE PUBLIC INTEGRITY IS
THROUGH PRIVATE, STRICTMORALITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THAT'S ONE THING,EXPLANATION.
SECOND, HAVE YOU BEEN TO THED.M.V. LATELY?
>> Jon: SURE.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT DO YOU THINK?
MY LICENSE IS EXPIRED AND IJUST DRIVE?
I MEAN, THAT'S -- THAT'S LUNACY!
>> SO, WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TOHAVE HAD A KALASHNIKOV HANDED TO
YOU AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE?
>> Jon: YES.
(LAUGHTER)SO, SO I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND.
THE PROBLEM THEN BECOMES, ITBECOMES LORD OF THE FLIES
AND WHOEVER CAN TAKE THESTRICTEST CONTROL AND THEN IT'S
JUST WARLORDISM, ISN'T IT?
THEN IT'S JUST THESE, THESEMILITIA MOVEMENTS WHO WERE VERY
VIOLENT AND VERY CONTROLLINGAND HOW LONG AFTER THESE
TYPES OF GROUPS TAKE OVER DOTHOSE PEOPLE GO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THE LINE AT THE D.M.V.
WASN'T THAT LONG BECAUSE, AT THEEND OF IT, I STILL HAD MY HEAD.
>> SO LOOK AT SISI IN EGYPT.>> Jon: YES.
>> YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF HAD ARESTORATION IN SISI --
>> Jon: YES.
>> SORRY, A RESTORATION IN EGYPTWITH SISI.
>> Jon: OF AN AUTOCRACY. YES.
>> EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
THAT KIND OF THING HAPPENED INIRAN.
I THINK A LOT OF IRANIANCITIZENS KIND OF REGRET WHICH
WAY THEY WENT IN REACTION AGAINSTHE KLEPTOCRATIC AND ABUSIVE
GOVERNMENT OF THE SHAH.
>> Jon: IN '79. YOU THINK THEYREGRET THE THEOCRACY?
>> YES. THAT'S RIGHT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THERE WERE BIGDEMONSTRATIONS, YOU KNOW,
IN IRAN IN 2009 AGAINST THEISLAMIC REPUBLIC WHICH IS WHAT
THE PEOPLE HAD CHOSENINSTEAD OF THE SHAH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NOW THE POINT I TRY TO MAKEIS THAT, YOU KNOW, ONCE STUFF
GETS THIS VIOLENT, ALL BETS AREOFF.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I'M NOT SAYING BOKO HARAM ISTHE BETTER CHOICE THAN THE
GOVERNMENT OF GOODLUCK JONATHAN.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS PEOPLE AREDRIVEN TO EXTREMES AND THEN YOU
GET SECURITY CRISES.
>> Jon: AND THAT IS THE TYPE OFTHING THAT IF YOU CAN CONTROL
SOME OF THE CORRUPTION, YOU TAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF THE ENERGY OUTOF THESE EXTREMIST MOVEMENTS.
>> EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
>> Jon: WILL YOU STICKAROUND FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT?
>> I'D LOVE TO.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. BEAUTIUL.
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MOREABOUT IT.
"THIEVES OF STATE," IT'S ON THESHELVES NOW.
SARAH CHAYES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THROW IT UP ON THE WEB.
