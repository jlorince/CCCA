[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
SO, SO, THERE WE GO. WHAT ISTHAT?
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE? TWISTEDAROUND THERE?
BOOM.
>> IN THE WAKE OF THE UKRAINEPLANE CRASH, ONE THING IS
CERTAIN.
BARACK OBAMA AIN'T GONNA DOANYTHING.
HE STOPPED PRESIDENTING LIKE AYEAR AND A HALF AGO.
NOW HE JUST SITS AROUND IN HISUNDERWEAR EATING CHEESE DOODLES,
GROWING HIS FINGERNAILS OUT ANDWATCHING THE SAME EPISODE OF THE
"GOLDEN GIRLS" OVER AND OVERAGAIN.
IT'S TRUE.JESUS, ALL RIGHT...
I SHOULD LOOK AT THESE INREHEARSAL.
AND APPARENTLY HE'S WHITE ANDHAS THE SAME BODY THAT WE USE
FOR A BIT WE DID WITH STEVECARELL LIKE 12 YEARS AGO.
ANYWAY, MY POINT IS THIS: WHATARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT RUSSIA?
>> WELL, WHAT WE NEED DO IS WEHAVE TO MATCH STRENGTH AGAINST
STRENGTH. WE REALLY NEEDTO SHOW RUSSIA THAT WE WILL,
YOU KNOW, MATCH THEIRMILITARY BUILDUP AND WE'LL HELP
UKRAINE MATCH THAT SO THEY CANDEFEND THEMSELVES.
>> Jon: SMART.
WE SEND THEIR GUYS WEAPONS ANDTHEN RUSSIA SENDS THEIR GUYS
MORE WEAPONS SO WE SEND MOREWEAPONS, YADDA, YADDA, YADDA,
WORLD PEACE.
OKAY.
ONE OF YOU IDIOTS HAS TO HAVE ABETTER IDEA.
>> I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUTCANCELING THE WORLD CUP.
WHY SHOULD COUNTRIES BE GOING INTHE WORLD CUP TO MOSCOW?
>> Jon: NICE.
SO NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THEONE GROUP MORE CORRUPT AND
THUGGISH THAN RUSSIA.
YEAH, OKAY, THAT'S REAL SMART.
SO THOSE ARE ALL ACTIONS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]BUT ACTIONS, ACTIONS ARE NOT
GOING TO DO ANYTHING.
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING THATSPEAKS LOUDER THAN ACTIONS.
>> WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATIONNOT YET PREPARED TO DO THAT YOU
THINK MUST BE DONE?
>> ONE, HE DIDN'T CALL PUTIN THETHUG THAT HE IS.
>> Jon: YES!
STICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK HISBONES, BUT NAMES, IS THAT HOW I
SEEM TO PEOPLE?[LAUGHTER]
THEY, THEY THINK I'M THUGGISH?
I'VE WRESTLED ALLIGATORS ANDBEARS, BUT NONE OF THEM EVER
HURT ME LIKE WORDS.
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT, HE WAS... ALLRIGHT.
SO THE QUESTION IS THIS: WHAT'STHE RIGHT MODEL FOR A PRESIDENT
IN THIS SITUATION.AND THE ANSWER BE:
>> WE SAW HOW REAGAN RESPONDED
TO THE SOVIETS BACK THEN.
>> Jon: YES, REAGAN.
ST. RONNY DEALT WITH A VERYSIMILAR SITUATION.
IN 1983 WHEN THE SOVIET UNIONSHOT DOWN A KOREAN PASSENGER
PLANE OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN.
I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW HERESPONDED.
HOW DID HE RESPOND?
>> REAGAN WAS AT THE RANCH INCALIFORNIA.
HE IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK.
>> RUSHED HOME FROM SANTABARBARA VACATION.
>> HE IMMEDIATELY CAME HOME ANDIMMEDIATELY BE BRIEFED,
IMMEDIATELY GET MOVING FORWARDAND CONDEMN THE SOVIET UNION IN
THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE.
>> Jon: IMMEDIATELY, PLANECRASHES, THEY GO TO TELL REAGAN
ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LIKE,WHAT HE'S ALREADY GONE.
THE SCENT OF AFTER SHAVE ANDJELLYBEANS THE ONLY THING
LINGERING IN THE AIR. HOW DIDHE SPRING INTO ACTION SO FAST?
TO THIS DAY NOBODY KNOWS, BUT WEKNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT, REAGAN
TOOK ALL OF RUSSIA'SMISSILES, TWIRLED THEM
UP SINGLE HANDEDLY AND THREWTHEM INTO THE SUN.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M SORRY.
THAT LAST PART WASN'T REAGAN.
IT WAS SUPERMAN.
BUT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.
THE POINT IS REAGAN ACTEDWITHOUT DELAY.
>> I WAS COVERING RONALD REAGANAT THAT TIME.
HE WAS IN SANTA BARBARA AT HISRANCH WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
AND QUITE FRANKLY, HE DIDN'TWANT TO LEAVE.
AND HIS ADVISERS REALIZED HOWTERRIBLE THIS LOOKED AND
EVENTUALLY PERSUADED HIM HE HADTO FLY BACK TO WASHINGTON AND
HAD TO MAKE THE SPEECH TO THENATION, BUT IT DID TAKE HIM FOUR
DAYS. [LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT? [CLEARS THROAT]
YES, REAGAN'S RESPONSE TO THATCATASTROPHE WAS SO SPECIAL,
SO REMARKABLE, IT WAS ENOUGH TOMAKE US FORGET WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED.
[LAUGHTER]WHICH IS THAT REAGAN GRUDGINGLY
CUT SHORT HIS 25-DAY VACATIONAFTER BEING CAUGHT ON CAMERA
RIDING A HORSE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T TAKE MYWORD FOR IT.
LET'S READ FROM HIS ACTUAL DIARYABOUT THE INCIDENT.
[CLEARS THROAT][AS RONALD REAGAN]: FRIDAY,
SEPTEMBER 2ND, THE SOVIETS SHOTDOWN A KOREAN AIRLINER WITH
269 PASSENGERS, 53 OFTHEM AMERICANS, INCLUDING
CONGRESSMAN LARRY McDONALD. WEWERE DUE TO RETURN TO WASHINGTON
ON LABOR DAY BUT REALIZED WECOULDN'T WAIT.
WE LEFT ON FRIDAY.
IT WAS HEARTBREAKING, DASH, IHAD REALLY LOOKED FORWARD TO
THOSE LAST THREE DAYS.
PUNCTUATION REAGANS.
YES.
REAGAN WAS IN DEEP MOURNING FORLOSING THE FINAL 12% OF HIS
VACATION.
IN FACT, IN 1988, WHEN THE U.S.
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT DOWN ANIRANIAN AIRLINER, ALSO UNDER
REAGAN'S WATCH, REAGAN REFUSEDTO END THAT VACATION EARLY.
AND BY THE WAY, AMERICA WAS SOTORN UP ABOUT SHOOTING DOWN THAT
PLANE THAT THE COMMANDER OF THESHIP WHO DID IT LATER RECEIVED A
MEDAL FOR HIS SERVICE.
I BRIEF IT WAS CALLED THE SILVEROH, EW, OH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
