[ APPLAUSE
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET
ACROSS.
THE THING ABOUT WEEDS IT'S VERY
PROPHETIC.
IT'S INTERESTING THAT A LOT OF
THE THINGS WE'VE DONE THAT SHOW
HAVE ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN REAL
LIFE.
A COUPLE SEASONS AGO THE TOWN IN
THE SHOW BURNED DOWN.
WE WERE FILMING IN VALENCIA AND
IT BURNED OUT.

THE BORDER, EL PASO.

DOING, TIJUANA.
COULD HAPPEN.

DRUGS ON YOUR SHOW AND THERE'S A
DRUG WAR.

CARTEL, DRUG LORDS, DRUG WARS.

SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE.
I WON'T NAME NAMES.
BUT IT HAPPENED.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS SPORT CALL
IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WOULD NEVER -- I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT MYSELF UNLESS SOMEBODY
WAS ACTUALLY BREAKING INTO MY
HOUSE AND STRANGLING ME THEN IT
WOULD BE CONVENIENT AT THAT
POINT AND I WOULD HAVE NOTHING
TO TO LOSE.
>> Jon: IF I HAVE ANY TAKE
AWAY FROM THIS INTERVIEW AND WE
DON'T HAVE A SUM UP A MORAL
MESSABLE.
IT'S NOT SO MUCH DON'T DO DRUGS.
YOU ARE SAYING TO THE KIDS OF
AMERICA IF YOU ARE GOING TO
