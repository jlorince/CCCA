( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS A HOLIDAY THAT IS NOT IN DANGER.
THERE IS SO MUCH CHRISTMAS ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR CHRISTMAS' DEFENDERS
TO FIGHT FOR CHRISTMAS WITHOUT ACCIDENTALLY DOING DAMAGE TO IT WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR FRIENDLY
FIRE ENGINE.
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR GOOD FRIEND BILL O'REILLY TAKES THE ATHEISTS' BAIT
>> WHAT RELIGION IS INVOLVED WITH CHRISTMAS
>> WHAT RELIGION CHRISTIANITY THAT'S NOT A RELIGION.
THAT'S A PLOS FEAR
>> YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME ON LIVE TELEVISION THAT CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A RELIGION?
>> CORRECT.
IT IS A PLOS FEE.
... PHILOSOPHY.
>> Jon: NOOOOO!
BILL, WHY?
BILL, WHY?
HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING FROM OUR FRIENDSHIP?
YOU JUST HANDED THAT ATHEIST ANOTHER THING HE CAN'T [BLEEP]
BELIEVE.
CHRISTIANITY IS A RELIGION.
CHRISTIANITY HAS A PHILOSOPHICAL ELEMENT BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PHILOSOPHY
AND A RELIGION.
FOR INSTANCE, LET'S LOOK AT THIS.
A LOT IN COMMON.
LOOSE FITTING CLOTHING, BEARDS, SANDALS, TEACHING THROUGH PARABLES, MARTYRDOM.
BUT HERE'S WHERE WE FIND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION.
AFTER THEIR MARTYRDOM, ONE OF THEM GOT BETTER.
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.
IT'S THE ONE WHO ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND IS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER WHO
WILL COME AGAIN TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD.
WHOSE KINGDOM WILL HAVE NO END.
ANYONE?
IT'S JESUS!
WE BESTOW ONE OF THEM TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
WHY ISN'T CHRISTIANITY A RELIGION?
>> CHRISTIANITY IS NOT AN ORGANIZED RELIGION.
A CHURCH THAT CAN BE IMPOSED.
CHRISTIANITY IS A PHILOSOPHY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE JESUS IS GOD IN ORDER TO ADMIRE HIS VIEW ON LIFE.
>> Jon: NO.
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE JESUS IS GOD TO BE A CRISTIAN.
FOR INSTANCE, I LIKE A LOT OF JESUS' PHILOSOPHY.
LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR.
A LITTLE CHEEK TURNING.
STONE NOT CASTING.
IT'S VERY NICE.
BUT WHILE I CAN GET AN "A" IN HIS PHILOSOPHY CLASS, I DON'T GET TO GO TO THE AFTER PARTY.
YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING HERE?
SO YOU WANT TO DO THIS AT MY PLACE OR YOUR PLACE BECAUSE
