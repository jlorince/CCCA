[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SHOW.
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.
EMOTION REPRESS, REPRESS.
DON'T FEEL -- I'M BACK.
SO LISTEN AS A STUDENT OFHISTORY ONE THING THAT WE'VE ALL
LEARNED IS THAT EVEN THEMIGHTIEST DYNASTIES EVENTUALLY
CRUMBLE.
THE MING DYNASTY, FELLED BYPEASANT REBELLIONS. THE HAPSBURG
DYNASTY, BROUGHT LOW BY WORLDWAR I AND UNWIELDY FACIAL HAIR.
AND NOW A PROBLEM FOR THEPREEMINENT DYNASTY OF OUR
AGE. >> THE DUCK DYNASTYCHARACTERS LED BY THE FAMILYPATRIARCH
ARE STARS IN THE REALITY SHOWUNIVERSE.
BUT IN AN ISSUE OF GQ PHILROBERTSON CALLED HOMOSEXUALITY
SINFUL.
JUST MORE OUT FROM THERE BESTIALITY, THE
DRUNKARDS THE SWINDLERS THEYWON'T INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF
GOD.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
>> Jon: YEAH, MAN IT'S ZZ TOPNOT ZZ BOTTOM.
[ LAUGHTER ]FIRST OF ALL I DON'T WATCH YOUR
DUCK DYNASTY THERE AND I ASSUMEDIT WAS A SHOW WHERE DUCKS
REENACTED THE SHOW DYNASTY.
WHICH, BY THE WAY, WOULD HAVEA HUGE GAY AUDIENCE.
BESIDES EQUATING BEING GAY WITHBESTIALITY HE
REMINISCED ABOUT HOW MUCHHAPPIER HE RECALLED BLACK
HAPEOPLE WERE IN THE PRE CIVILRIGHTS ERA, AND THAT NONE OF
THEM DURING THAT TIMEWERE UPSET AND WERE IN
FACT SINGING IN THE FIELDSAND NO ONE WAS SINGING THE
BLUES FORGETTING, OF COURSE,THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHEN AND
WHERE THE BLUES WERE INVENTED.
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE GLAAD FILED ACOMPLAINT AND NAACP, WHICH MEANS
SOMEONE ELSE IS ABOUT TO GETPRETTY UPSET.
>> THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THEFIRST AMENDMENT.
THIS IS THE WORD POLICE.
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
>> Jon: YES, I, TOO, HAVE APROBLEM WITH THE WORD OF POLICE.
IT'S BY FAR THE WORST LAW ANDORDER SPINOFF.
I DON'T CARE FOR IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]LOOK, I THINK WHAT THE GUY SAID
IS IGNORANT BUT I HAVE ANINCLINATION TO SUPPORT A WORLD
WHERE SAYING IGNORANT (bleep)ON TELEVISION DOESN'T GET YOU
KICKED OFF THAT MEDIUM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]BUT I GUESS I STAND WITH THE
FREE SPEECH ABSOLUTISTS AT FOXNEWS WHO DON'T BELIEVE YOU
SHOULD PRESSURE PEOPLE TO HAVETO ADHERE TO CULTURAL NORMS OF
SPEECH MOSTLY.
>> WHY ARE SO MANY TOWNSREMOVING THE WORD AND THE NAME
CHRISTMAS.
>> ISN'T IT DISCRIMINATINGAGAINST CHRISTIANS BY CALLING IT
A HOLIDAY TREE.
>> CHRISTMAS IS CHRISTMASTHE RELIGION
FOR CHRISTIANS. RESPECT IT.
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE BUSY TRYINGTO ERASE CHRISTMAS FROM OUR
CULTURE.
>> IT'S NOT A XMAS TREE, IT'S ACHRISTMAS TREE.
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING HAPPYHOLIDAYS.
>> DO YOU DEBATE THAT THERE AREALL KINDS OF INSTANCES WHERE
CHRISTMAS IS STRUCK FROM THELEXICON.
>> WHO GIVES A RIP ABOUT WHETHEROR NOT A WHITE OR RED POINSETTIA
IS IN THE SCHOOL.
IT DOESN'T HAVE JESUS ON IT.
GET OVER IT.
ARE THERE FLOWERS WITH JESUS ON THEM?
THEIR BELIEF IN FREE SPEECHDOESN'T EXTEND TO THE HOLIDAYS
WHERE THE WORD CHRISTMAS ISMANDATORY.
FOX WOULDN'T PRESSURE PEOPLE TOUSE THE PHRASE MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>> THE GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLANDREFUSING TO CALL IT A CHRISTMAS
TREE. INSTEAD HE'S CALLING ITTHE HOLIDAY TREE.
FOR FOLKS WATCHING RIGHT NOWTHINKING THAT'S CRAZY I SHOULD
CALL THE GOVERNOR.
WE HAVE HIS PHONE  NUMBER.
>> WHEN DEPARTMENT STORESORDERED THE EMPLOYEES NOT TO SAY
MERRY CHRISTMAS WE WON THATBECAUSE WE NAMED THEM AND NO ONE
WENT SHOPPING THERE.
>> THEY CAN CALL YOUR RADIO SHOWAND CONTACT THE GOVERNOR.
>> TULSA'S HOLIDAY PARADE OFLIGHTS WILL GO ON AS SCHEDULED
SATURDAY DESPITE THE PROTESTS.
>> FORTUNATELY THE PARADE WILLNOT SUFFER.
>> Jon: I END WITH THE SAGEWORDS OF FOX APPROVED CAST OF
DUCK DYNASTY>> HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY.
>>HOLIDAYS.
