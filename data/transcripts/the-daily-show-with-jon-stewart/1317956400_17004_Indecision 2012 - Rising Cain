TERRITORY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU KNOW EVERY TIME GOD
CLOSES A DOOR SHE OPENS A
WINDOW.
HERMAN CAIN BACKED BY
SOARING POLL NUMBERS HAS
LUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE
APPEARING LATE NIGHT TO
SUNDAY MORNING TO WHATEVER
THIS IS.
>> HI,S WITH AS YOU KNOW I
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET MITT
ROMNEY AND PERRY TO COME AND
DO A VIDEO WITH ME AND SO
FAR THEY HAVEN'T ACCEPTED.
AND I WANTED TO GET A
FIRST-TIER CANDIDATE SO WE
HAD TO MAKE OUR-- OUR OWN,
HERMAN CAIN.
LA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU BETTER HURRY UP
THE INTERVIEW BECAUSE I'M
SURE THAT LA QUINTA SUITE IS
BOOKED FOR A PORN SHOOT AT
ABOUT 2:00.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE SECRET TO CAIN'S
SUCCESS, BRANDING AND CHARM.
>> THERE IS ICE MILK AND
HAGEN DANZ BLACK WALNUT.
>> BLACK WALNUT ISN'T A
FAVORITE OF THE WEEK.
>> YOU STILL SEE BLACK
WALNUT MOVING UP THE CHARTS
WITHIN I CAN EAT BLACK
WALNUT ALL THE TIME.
>> BLACK WALNUT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Stephen: VERY LIKABLE.
DON'T YOU THINK BLACK WALL
NRT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST
70 BLAXPLOITATION MOVIE
EVER.
RUDY RAY, BLACK WALNUT.
THE BLACK PRIVATE DICKçó WHO'S
SHELL IS REALLY THICK.
GEORGE KENNEDY IS HIS ARCH
NEMESIS HONKY PISTACHIO.
AND PAM GREER IS THE HOTTEST
WOMAN EVER IN THE WORLD.
HERMAN CAIN ISN'T ALL ICE
CREAM, HE'S GOT SUBSTANCE.
HE HAS TAKEN ON THE WALL
STREES PROTEST.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY
WANT BUT I THINK THEY THINK
THAT THE BANKS HAVE GIVEN
THEM A RAW DEAL OVER THE
LAST FEW YEARS.
>> I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO
BACK THIS UP.
>> Jon: LET ME STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.
HERMAN CAIN, THAT IS
ADORABLE.
I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO
BACK-- YOU STILL EXPECT THE
MEDIA TO DEMAND YOU BACK
YOUR CLAIMS UP WITH FACTS?
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS A
LITTLE LONGER YOU WILL REL
REALIZE THEY [BLEEP].
THAT REPORTER IS NOT
LISTENING TO YOU, HE IS JUST
ADMIRING HIS PAYING
ATTENTION FACE IN THE
MONITOR BEHIND YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, YOU WERE SAYING
ABOUT NO FACTS.
>> I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO
BACK THIS UP, BUT I HAPPEN
TO BELIEVE THAT THESE
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE PLANNED
AND ORCHESTRATED TO DISTRACT
FROM THE FAILED POLICIES OF
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
>> Jon: THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?
HEY, MAN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
FACTS TO BACK IT UP, WHY
DON'T YOU PUT IT MORE OUT
THERE I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO
BACK THIS UP BUT I THINK THE
PRESIDENT IS A SPY FROM AN
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE
DINOSAURS NEVER WENT EXTINCT
AND PEOPLE ARE KEPT AS PETS,
YOU KNOW.
I WILL TELL YOU, GIVE US
ANOTHER STUPID NONFACTUAL
BLACK WALNUT PROTEST
ANALYSIS.
>> DON'T BLAME WALL STREET.
DON'T BLAME THE BIG BANKS.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB AND
YOU ARE NOT RICH, BLAME
YOURSELF.
>> IT NOT A PERSON'S FAULT
BECAUSE THEY SUCCEEDED.
IT IS A PERSON'S FAULT IF
THEY FAILED.
>> Jon: THAT IS INTERESTING,
SO PEOPLE SHOULD NOT SCAPE
GOAT ANYBODY JUST BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T ATTAIN THE
AMERICAN DREAM.
>> THE AMERICAN DREAM IS
UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE OUR
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIJACKED
BY THE LIBERALS IN
WASHINGTON D.C..
>> Jon: WAIT, I SAW YOU
BLAME YOURSELF.
OH, SO IT'S NOT, YOU DON'T
BLAME-- YOU DON'T BLAME BIG
BUSINESS.
YOU BLAME YOURSELF AND
LIBERALS.
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
FACTS TO BACK THIS UP-- BUT
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A PLOT
TO BRING DOWN PIZZA CHAINS.
AND ACTIVIA YOGURT IS FILLED
WITH TINY GHOSTS WHOSE
PURPOSE IS TO SCARE THE POOP
OUT OF YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
AND BESIDES, AND BESIDES,
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
ON CORPORATE CORE RUPING HAS
EXPIRED.
YOU DON'T THINK THE BANKS
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE
CRISIS THAT WE WENT INTO IN
2008.
>> THEY DID HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE CRISIS THAT
WE WENT INTO IN 2008.
BUT WE ARE NOT IN 2008.
WE'RE IN 2011.
>> Jon: IT WAS THREE YEARS
AGO.
IF WE WERE BEES WE WOULD
ALREADY BE DEAD AND OUR
GREAT GRANDCHILDREN WOULD BE
IN CHARGE.
YOU THINK BEES WORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THREE
GENERATIONS AGO.
THEY ARE TOO BUSY MAKING
HONEY AND COMMUNICATING
THROUGH DANCE.
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
THE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP--
(LAUGHTER)
BUT JOHN BOEHNER CRIES A LOT
BECAUSE HIS NOSE IS AN ONION.
