I'M SORRY.
IT'S BECOMING VERY CLEAR THAT
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT
THESE THREE SCANDAL/ISSUES TO
MAKE ANY DEFINITIVE JUDGMENT ON
THEM YET.
BUT IF IT'S A SCANDAL YOU WANT,
IT'S THE SCANDAL WE HAVE.
IN OUR RECURRING SERIES ABOUT
RETURNING IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
VETERANS AND THE PAPERWORK
QUAGMIRE THAT AWAIT THEM THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MADE A
PROMISE IN APRIL OF 2009 THAT
THEY WOULD CREATE A SEAMLESS
COMPUTERIZED VETERANS HEALTH
RECORD SYSTEM.
COSTS BE DAMNED!
CRITICS SAID IT COULDN'T BE
DONE.
FOUR YEARS AND $1 BILLION LATER,
IT TURNS OUT, YEAH, THEY WERE
RIGHT, IT COULDN'T BE DONE.
( LAUGHTER )
AT LEAST NOT BY THE
ADMINISTRATION.
IN FACT, IT SO COULDN'T BE DONE
THERE'S STILL A BACKLOG OF
CLAIMS FOR 900,000 VETERANS AND
PAPER DISABILITY RECORDS STILL
UNDIGITIZED AND PILED UP SO HIGH
THE FLOOR OF ONE VA FIELD OFFICE
IS GOING TO COLLAPSE.
( LAUGHTER )
PERHAPS INJURING PEOPLE WHO,
LUCKILY, WOULD AT LEAST HAVE
INSTANT ACCESS TO THE PROPER
FORMS THEY WOULD NEED TO FILE
THE CRUSHED PELVIS CLAIMS AND
MOST LIKELY HAVE THE TIME TO
FILL THEM OUT BECAUSE OF HOW
LONG IT WILL TAKE TO DIG THEM
OUT OF THE RUBBLE.
LAST MONTH, THE HOUSE
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CALLED
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CHUCK
CHUCK HAGEL.
7 HAGEL.
YOU KNOW, IF HE MARRIED
KATHERINE HEIGL HE'D BE CHUCK
HAGEL HEIGL.
SERIOUS.
THEY CALLED CHUCK HAIG TOLL ASK
SINCE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A NEW
COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM, WHICH WILL
THE TWO EXISTING SYSTEMS, ALTA
AND VISTA, FROM D.O.D. AND V.A.
BE ABLE TO FULLY TALK TO EACH
OTHER.
>> WHAT THE CONGRESS INSTRUCTED,
WHAT THE CONGRESS FUNDED WAS A
SEAMLESS SYSTEM.
WE'LL HAVE IT SHORTLY.
CAN I TELL YOU IN A WEEK OR TWO
WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING DECIDED
WITHIN 30 DAYS, I'LL TELL THAT
YOU.
>> Jon:  30 DAYS!
A HARD NUMBER.
SINCE THAT INTERVIEW, 30 DAYS
AGO HE HAD OUR CHUCK HAGEL
ADVENT CALENDAR.
I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE
THING.
IT IS DAY 30.
I'VE BEEN OPENING THE DOORS.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT IN HERE
A LITTLE BIT OF NICE CHOCOLATE--
I'M EXPLAINING THIS BECAUSE WE
HAVE SO MANY RABBIS IN THE
AUDIENCE TONIGHT.
YEAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT
CHRISTIANS GIVE CHOCOLATE GIFTS
AND ( BLEEP ) FOR, LIKE, 30 DAYS
STRAIGHT, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE
DEALING WITH, LIKE, THE
CRUCIFIXION.
IT'S REALLY JUST-- IT'S ALL
ABOUT CANDY.
WHEREAS JEWS, EVEN WHEN WE'RE
FREED WE'RE LIKE, "HAVE SOME
BITTER HERBS."
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
SO IT'S-- FINALLY HERE.
IT WAS 30 DAYS FIVE DAYS AGO, SO
DID THEY HAVE A DECISION ON THE
INTEROPERABILITY?
WE ASKED THE HOUSE
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND WE
CALLED THE PENTAGON.
HERE'S A QUICK SUMMARY OF THOSE
THOSE CALLS WENT.
>> NO.
>> NO.
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
>> NOOOOOO!
>> Jon:  CHEWY.
I GUESS RUNNING A BUREAUCRACY
WITH A SINGLE GOAL IS JUST TOO
COMPLICATED.
>> THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN TWICE NOW
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST
EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN OPERATIONS IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.
>> Jon:  OH, YEAH, THAT'S
RIGHT.
THEY DID RUN A VERY EFFECTIVE
CAMPAIGN OPERATION.
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN
ONLINE COMPONENT HERE, TAKING
TWO DISPARATE DATABASES AND
TURNING THEM INTO ONE GIGANTIC
DEBUT.
A BILLION DOLLARS SAYS THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.
>> AT OBAMA HEADQUARTERS WHAT
THEY DID FINALLY WAS UNITE THE
DATABASES THEY'D HAD FROM THE
FIRST CAMPAIGN, THE FUND-RAISING
DATABASE, THE POLLING DATABASE,
ALL INTO ONE GIGANTIC DATABASE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  SURE.
YOU CAN DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE
PAYING PEOPLE WITH PIZZA.
THEY CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING.
( LAUGHTER )
THESE PAPER ROARS AT THE V.A.
ARE ALREADY COMPLETELY
FRAGMENTED.
YOU WOULD NEED AN INCREDIBLY
SOPHISTICATE DATA MINING
OPERATIONS TO IDENTIFY THE
VETERANS LET ALONE TARGET THEM--
ROLE ROLL THE CLIP.
>> THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN IS WIDELY
BELIEVE BELIEVE TO HAVE THE MOST
SOPHISTICATING MINING OPERATION.
>> THEY CREATED A HOLISTIC
SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD NOT JUST
TARGET PEOPLE BUT FIGURE OUT THE
BEST WAY TO TARGET PEOPLE.
>> THEY COMPILED INFORMATION ON
YOUR BUYING HABITS LIKE WHAT
MAGAZINE YOU SUBSCRIBED TO,
MAYBE INFORMATION ON WHERE AND
HOW YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL.
>> Jon:  THAT'S NOT CREEPY
AT ALL.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT?
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO GIVE MONEY TO
VETERANS, GET MONEY FROM.
VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS, AND
ALTHOUGH THESE VETERANS ARE
ACTIVELY TRYING TO GIVE YOU
THEIR INFORMATION.
HAVE SOME GIVEN UP, GO TO TO
DOOR.
YOU THINK HE WOULD DO THAT?
>> THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS AND
AIDE STAFFERS HAVE BEEN WORKING
NONSTOP, KNOCKING ON DOORS,
MAKING PHONE CALLS AND GETTING
PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY.
>> Jon:  MOTHER ( BLEEP )!
YOU COULD CLEAR UP THIS V.A.
THING IN A MONTH!
CLEARLY, THE LESSON APPEARS TO
BE, IF WE COULD TAKE THE SAME
URGENCY, ENTHUSIASM, AND CLARITY
OF VISION YOU NEED TO GET
ELECTED TO GOVERNMENT AND APPLY
THOSE TWO DPORCHING.
CAN WE FIX SOME PROBLEMS?
WHY, WE MOTHER ( BLEEP ) CAN.
WE'LL B
