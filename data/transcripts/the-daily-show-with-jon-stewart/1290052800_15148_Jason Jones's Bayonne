>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
A BIG ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
JAY-Z.
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT.
THAT I'M NOT ANGRY, YOU JUST
WANT A TACO.
THAT WAS ANOTHER SIGN I LIKED AT
THE RALLY.
JAY-Z IS HERE BECAUSE HE'S
DROPPING A BRAND NEW -- BOOK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HE SPITS NONFICTION PROSE IS
WHAT HE SPITS.
[LAUGHTER]
AN AWFUL LOT GOING ON IN THE
WORLD.
I WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.
>> BRISTOL PALIN HAS SURVIVED TO
THE FINAL TWO.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING
SHE'S GOT THEN FAR BECAUSE OF
HER MOTHER.
>> SOME BELIEVE THE ONLY REASON
SHE IS ON THE SHOW IS BECAUSE OF
TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN CONSPIRACY.
>> THIS HAD ONE MAN IN RURAL
WISCONSIN SO ANGERED HE TOOK HIS
LOADED SHOTGUN AND PUT A BULLET
IN HIS TELEVISION.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO
SAY IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
WHEN I WATCH DANCING WITH THE
STARS I, TOO, HAVE A LOADED
WEAPON, I NEVER THOUGHT TO POINT
IT AT THE TV.
[LAUGHTER]
I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY
THAT BRISTOL GOT FARTHER THAN
BRANDY WITH DANCING WITH THE
STARS BECAUSE BRANDY REALLY HAS
BEEN -- NO, NO.
WHO GIVES A (bleep).
IT'S BRISTOL PALIN.
S.
SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR ANYTHING.
I'M SURE WERE A REAL HOUSEWIFE
HAS GONE OFF HER MEDS AND IS
ABOUT TO MAKE TELEVISION
HISTORY.
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STORY.
>> WILLOW PALIN, SARAH PALIN'S
TEEN DOCTOR, TMZ GOT SCREEN
SHOTS OFF OF FACEBOOK SHOWING
WILLOW USING DBLAI SLURS SLURS TO SLAM
FACEBOOKERS SHE THOUGHT WERE
TRASHING HER FAMILY.
>> Jon: STOP MAKING ME FEEL
SYMPATHY FOR THE PALINS.
STOP IT THE 16-YEAR-OLD KID'S
FACEBOOK PAGE.
NINE-YEAR-OLD PIPER PALIN'S
HEADLESS BARBIE UP NEXT.
ACCIDENT OR PEDIATRIC RAGE
DISORDER?
KIDS ARE OFF LIMITS.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE SHOULD
GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO TREAT HER
CHILDREN WITH KID GLOVES AND
RESPECT TO SHOW WE DON'T JUDGE
INDIVIDUALS AND MOCK THEM PURELY
BASED ON WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE.
WOULD THEY BECOME THE OBJECT OF
MOCKERY IF THEIR MOTHER WASN'T
SARAH PALIN.
>> HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SITUATION
WITH THE OFFICIAL SITUATION?
>> EXCUSE ME?
>> OH, SNAP, B PALIN.
>> I HOPE YOU ARE COMMITTED AS
TO SAME SEX AS THOSE ABS.
>> I RESPECT ABSTINENCE.
>>
I SAID THAT.
>> I WORRY ABOUT YOU PRACTICING
SAFE SEX.
>> I ACTUALLY PRACTICE A LOT
WAPOW MAGNUMS!
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO
ENTRAPMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY IF THAT GENTLEMAN
GETS YOU PREGNANT YOUR UTERUS IS
OFFICIALLY CLASSIFIED AS THE
SITUATION WOMB.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU ARE WONDERING WHY THE
SITUATION IS DRESSED LIKE HE IS
DRESSED IT'S BECAUSE THEY SHOT
THAT PSA ON THE SET OF OF HIS
NEW MOVIE SATURDAY NIGHT HERPES.
LEAVE THE PALINS OUT OF IT.
ANY NEW SHOW THAT SARAH PALIN
HERSELF HAS PARTICIPATED IN
WOULD BE FAIR GAME LIKE SARAH
PALIN'S ALASKA WHERE THE MAMA
GRIZZLY AND CHIEF SHOWS US THE
PIONEER WOMAN SHE IS.
>> THE HARDEST PART IS THE THE
FACT THAT I'M SCARED OF HEIGHTS.
>> I HAVE TO LEAVE MY BLACKBERRY
HERE.
SO COOL.
>> Jon: YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANY
OF THAT BEFORE.
I BET THAT BAR OF MOOSE JERKY ON
YOUR COUNTER IS STORE BOUGHT.
YOU HEARD ME, STORE BALL.
IT'S LIKE SAYING SEE MY NEW YORK
OH, MY GOD, WHO HONKED THEIR
HORN?
BUT THE SHOW'S REAL STAR IS THE
STATE OF LK LK LK WHERE
BOUNTIFUL LANDS ARE TEAMING WITH
STRAINED PALIN POLITICAL
METAPHORS.
>> JUST RELOAD.
>> SHE'S TRYING TO SHOW HER
CUBS.
NOBODY IS GOING TO DO IT FOR
YOU.
>> TODD AND HIS BUDDIES BUILT A
14 FOOT FENCE AND WE'RE THANKFUL
FOR THAT BY THE WAIRK I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE
DID OTHERS COULD SAY THIS IS
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO SECURE OUR
NATION'S BORDERS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NO OFFENSE TO YOUR
HUSBAND'S CARP -- CARPENTRY
SKILLS BUT THAT WOULDN'T KEEP
OUT RACCOONS.
>> Jon: I PRESENT TO YOU A
SNEAK PEEK AT MY PRODUCTION
COMPANIES NEWEST BABY STARRING
