PERRY IS NOT READY FOR PRIME
TIME.
I GUESS ONCE AGAIN ROMNEY IS
IS THE FRONTRUNNER.
>> ALSO ONCE AGAIN WE'RE
HEARING THOSE CALLS FOR CHRIS
CHRISTIE TO JUMP INTO THE
RACE.
>> RENEWED TALKS THAT NEW
JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
MIGHT VERY WELL JUMP IN THE
RACE.
>> DOUBTS ABOUT PERRY FUELING
A NEW PUSH TO GET CHRIS
CHRISTIE IN THE RACE.
>> Jon: YOU WANT TO ADD
ANOTHER CANDIDATE?
IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY IS A SEASON OF
AMERICAN IDOL IN REVERSE.
WHERE EVERY WEEK WE JUST ADD
SOME OTHER IDIOT.
ALL THAT'S MISSING IS THE
HUMILIATING AUDITION WHERE THE
CONTESTANT MANGLES ONE OF YOUR
FAVORITE SONGS.
♪ OUT OVER THE... ♪♪
>> Jon: THAT HURTS ME.
FIRST YOU GUYS WANTED BACHMANN
AND THEN PERRY.
NOW KRISTIE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
REPUBLICAN BASE, MEET ME AT
CAMERA 3.
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE
POSSIBILITY THAT MAYBE YOUR
CANDIDATES AREN'T THE PROBLEM.
MAYBE IT'S YOU.
YOU SEEM HARD TO PLEASE, TO
FIGURE OUT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE UNREALISTIC.
I MEAN, YOU'RE PRO-LIFE YET....
>> YOUR STATE HAS EXECUTED 234
DEATH ROW INMATES, MORE THAN
ANY OTHER GOVERNOR IN MODERN
TIMES.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WHAT WAS THAT?
YOU'RE AFRAID OF DEATH PANELS
YET FOR UNINSURED COMA
PATIENTS....
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT SOCIETY
SHOULD JUST LET HIM DIE?
>> AUDIENCE: YES.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE CROWD,
YEAH!
YOU GUYS SUPPORT THE TROOPS.
WELL EXCEPT FOR CAPTAIN
CREATINE OVER HERE.
IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICAN BASE
IS AT WAR WITH ITS OWN TALKING
POINTS.
I WANT SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO
CUT TAXES AND BALANCE THE
BUDGET.
SOMEONE WHO IS A KILLED ORATOR
BUT DOESN'T TALK ALL FANCY.
THE CHILD OF POOR IMMIGRANTS
WHO WILL BUILD A FENCE TO KEEP
THEM OUT OF THIS COUNTRY.
SOMEONE WHO'S STRONG ENOUGH
FOR A MAN BUT PH BALANCED FOR
A WOMAN.
SOMEONE WHO WILL ROLL UP THEIR
SLEEVES BUT NOT SHOW THEIR
ARMS.
I FEEL LIKE IF THIS MAN CAME
ALONG TODAY THE REPUBLICAN
RESPONSE WOULD BE, I DON'T
REALLY GO FOR THOSE HOLLYWOOD
TYPES.
IT'S LIKE YOUR IDEAL CANDIDATE
IS A RARE SUPER HEAVY ELEMENT
THAT COULD ONLY EXIST IN A
PARTICULAR PARTICLE
ACCELERATOR.
AND EVEN THEN ONLY FOR A
FRACTION OF A SECOND.
BEFORE YOU ALL REMEMBERED HOW
MUCH YOU HATE SCIENCE.
YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE A LONG,
HARD LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
YOU NEED TO TAKE A LONG, HARD
LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND NOT
COME AWAY THINKING THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS
MIRROR.
AND NOW YOU WANT CHRIS
CHRISTIE.
SURE YOU DO.
>> THE FOLKS WHO CRITICIZED MY
APPOINTMENTS OF MOHAMMED ARE
IGNORANT, ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT
OF THAT, AND HAD CRITICIZE HIM
BECAUSE HE'S A MUSLIM
AMERICAN.
THE SHARIA LAW BUSINESS IS
CRAP.
IT'S JUST CRAZY.
AND I'M TIRED OF DEALING WITH
THE CRAZIES.
>> Jon: HE'S TALKING ABOUT
YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
