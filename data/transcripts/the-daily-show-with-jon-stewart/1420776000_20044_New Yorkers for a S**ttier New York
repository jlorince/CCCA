>> Jon: HELLO. WELCOME BACK TOTHE SHOW.
IF YOU LIVE HERE IN NEW YORK, A,YOU ARE VERY COLD.
BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN AROUGH FEW WEEKS FOR RELATIONS
BETWEEN MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO, THESOCIALIST SASQUATCH RUNNING OUR
CITY --(LAUGHTER)
-- AND THE NEW YORK POLICEDEPARTMENT, ANGRY OFFICERS EVEN
TURNING THEIR BACKS ON THEMAYOR AT A FUNERAL FOR AN
OFFICER BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEMAYOR DOES NOT RESPECT THEM.
BUT AT LEAST THERE'S STILLSOME GOOD NEWS.
>> THE NUMBER OF MURDERS IN NEWYORK CITY DROPPED TO A RECORD
LOW LAST YEAR.
328 PEOPLE WERE REPORTED KILLEDIN 2014.
THAT'S THE LOWEST NUMBER SINCEAT LEAST 1963.
THE CITY IS ACTUALLY SEEINGLOWER NUMBERS IN ALMOST EVERY
MAJOR CRIME CATEGORY.
>> Jon: BURGLARY, DOWN!
ASSAULT, DOWN!
REMEMBER THAT GIANT APE USED TOBE ON THE SKYSCRAPER?
GONE!
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO DEALWITH NOW IS THE OCCASIONAL KOALA
RAUCOUS WHICH IS REALLY ONE OFTHE MORE ADORABLE PROBLEMS OUR
CITY HAS. YOU CAN GET RID OFTHEM WITH A LITTLE EUCALYPTUS,
THEY'LL COME RIGHT TO YOU.
AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT ACRIME DECREASE WOULD HELP SMOOTH
THINGS OVER BETWEEN THE MAYORAND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
BUT IN FACT, JUST AS WE'VEREACHED CRUISING ALTITUDE,
THE POLICE HAVE DECIDEDTO SWITCH THE ENGINES OFF.
>> NEW YORK POLICE HAVEDRAMATICALLY REDUCED ENFORCEMENT
AS A POSSIBLE PROTESTAGAINST THE MAYOR.
OVERALL ARRESTS,INCLUDING FELONIES DOWN 56%.
PARKING VIOLATIONS DOWN 93% ANDTRAFFIC CITATIONS DOWN 92%.
>> THE POLICE COMMISSIONERACKNOWLEDGED THERE HAS BEEN A
SLOWDOWN RECENTLY IN SUMMONSESAND ARRESTS.
>> Jon: SLOW DOWN SOUNDS SONEGATIVE.
MORE OF A REALLY PUBLIC SAFETYSTAYCATION, IF YOU WILL.
EXPLAINS THE NYPD'S NEW MOTTO,"JUST CHILL AND REFLECT."
SO, YES, YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS ANEGATIVE NEW YORK'S FINEST MAY
HAVE STOPPED DOING THAT WHOLECRIME FIGHTING THING, OR, OR
THINK OF IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY.
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF IT ASVISITING OUR CITY, NOW MIGHT BE
THE PERFECT TIME.
