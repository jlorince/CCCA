>> Jon: I WAS BEING FACETIOUS,BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A BIG
CONVERSATION NOW THAT WE AREHAVING ABOUT CRIME.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SHOOTINGS IN NEW YORKCITY HAVE RISEN OVER THESE PAST
TWO YEARS AND ARE NOW AT 20%LEVEL, I GUESS HIGHER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE SINCE THE STOPPING OFSTOP AND FRISK.
IT CAN'T BE THAT THE ONLY WAY WECAN CONTROL SHOOTINGS IN
NEW YORK CITY IS WHAT APPEARS TOBE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND
ANGERING PROGRAM OF STOP ANDFRISK.
BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE A REALTHING.
>> LET ME SAY IT A LITTLEDIFFERENTLY.
WHEN BILL BRATTON CAME AS OURCOMMISSIONER, FIRST PRESS
CONFERENCE HE SAID IN TERMS OFSTOP AND FRISK, YOU CAN'T BREAK
THE LAW TO ENFORCE THE LAW.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT FROM THE BEGINNING WASTHE TEMPLATE WE TOOK.
SO CAN YOU DRIVE DOWN CRIMEWHILE RESPECTING CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS?
ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE MY FIRSTYEAR IN OFFICE, BILL BRATTON'S
FIRST YEAR AS COMMISSIONER,CRIME WENT DOWN FROM 2013-2014,
THE LOWEST NUMBER OF MURDERS INN EW YORK IN 50 YEARS.
>> Jon: I GUESS YOU'RE SAYING WECAN DO BETTER.
>> WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO BETTER.
>> Jon: WE CAN KILL MOREPEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU MISINTERPRETED.
THERE'S BEEN A HORRIBLEMISUNDERSTANDING.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.
>> WE BROUGHT DOWN MURDER TO ARATE SINCE WE'VE NOT SEEN SINCE
THE EARLY '60s.
WE BROUGHT DOWN CRIME ACROSS THEBOARD.
WE DO HAVE A SHOOTING PROBLEM,LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR.
NOTHING LIKE NEW YORK CITY HAD15, 20 YEARS AGO, BUT SOMETHING
PERSISTENT PARTICULARLY AROUNDGANGS, AND WE HAVE NEW
STRATEGIES TO GO IN THERE BOTHWITH AGGRESSIVE POLICING BUT
ALSO GANG INTERVENTION, WHICH ISTHE PROCESS OF UNDERMINING GANG
RECRUITMENT AT THE THE COMMUNITYLEVEL, WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN TO
WORK ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
THOSE STRAPS NEED TO BE APPLIED.
GOING BACK TO ANUNCONSTITUTIONAL ALIENATING
APPROACH IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR ANDINAPPROPRIATE TO THE POPULOUS,
IT DOESN'T WORK.
IT TIES UP TIME AND ENERGY INTOTHINGS THAT AREN'T SERIOUS
CRIME.
SO WE'RE BROADLY ON THE RIGHTTRACK.
WE'RE RETRAINING OUR POLICEFORCES TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH
THE COMMUNITY.
WE'RE DOING BODY CAMERAS, WHICHW ILLINSTILL MORE CONFIDENCE
WITH THE POLICE AND COMMUNITIES.
WE'RE PROVIDING MORE TECHNOLOGYTO THE NYPD SO THEY WILL BE MORE
EFFECTIVE.
THING THESE WILL ADD UP ANDBECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT WASTING
TIME ON UNNECESSARY ANDUNCONSTITUTIONAL STOPS OR
LOW-LEVEL MARIJUANA ARRESTSEITHER.
>> Jon: WITH THAT I WOULD BEON--
BUT HOW DO YOU BRING UP THATMORALE -- BY THE WAY, IS A POUND
LOW LEVEL?
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU HAVECOMMUNITIES WHO BELIEVE THE
POLICE FORCE DOES NOT RESPECTTHEM AND TREATS THEM LIKE
THEY'RE AN OCCUPYING ARMY INAN AREA, AND THEN A POLICE FORCE
THAT FEELS DISRESPECT ORFEELS LIKE THE BAD POLICE
OFFICERS ARE BEING USED TOTAR THEM IN A SYSTEMIC WAY.
HOW DO YOU BRIDGE THE GAPS INTHE COMMUNITY SO PEOPLE FEEL
LIKE THEY'RE BOTH BEING TREATEDFAIRLY WHEN, YOU KNOW AS I DO,
THE MINUTE MURDERS AND SHOOTINGSGO UP POLITICAL PRESSURE IS
GOING TO BECOME IMMENSE, GETTHIS OUT OF OUR SIGHT.
PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THECONSTITUTION WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE
IT'S NOT SAFE.
>> WELL, I THINK THE GOOD NEWSIS IN THIS CITY WE HAD A REAL
THOROUGH DEBATE, AND PEOPLE DIDVOTE IN FAVOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS AND RESPECT FORCOMMUNITY, WHILE HAVING STRONG
POLICING.
THERE'S NO DICHOTOMY HERE.
IN THE END A SAFER CITY IS ONEIN WHICH POLICE AND CITY HAVE A
POWERFUL, STRONG, WORKINGRELATIONSHIP THAT ENCOURAGES A
COMMUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATIONWITH THE POLICE.
POLICE OFFICERS WILL TELL YOUTHERE'S POLICE IN EVERY
COMMUNITY, LAW ABIEWDING PEOPLEWHO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE
WEAPONS AND THE BAD GUYS ARE.
WE WANT THEM ON THE SIDE OF THEPOLICE AND THE BOND BETWEEN
POLICE.
WE FIND AS WE HAVE BEEN MAKINGOUR REFORMS AND BRINGING POLICE
AND COMMUNITY BACK TOGETHER,WE'RE SEE AGO DIFFERENT
RELATIONSHIP.
WE HAVE A CIVILIAN COMPLAINTREVIEW BOARD, COMPLAINTS ARE
DOWN 25% FROM A YEAR AGO BECAUSEPEOPLE ARE STARTING TO MOVE PAST
SOME OF THOSE DIVISIONS OF THEPAST AND ULTIMATELY EVERYONE
WANTS GOOD AND DECENT POLICINGAND POLICE WANT TO BE PROUD OF
THEIR PROFESSION AS THEY HAVE ARIGHT TO.
>> Jon: ARE THEY BRINGING MORECOPS, YOU KNOW, POLICING AREAS
THEY'RE FROM AS OPPOSED TOCOMING IN FROM OTHER --
>> ABSOLUTELY, POLICING AREASTHEY'RE FROM AND THE OTHER
VARIATION IS COMMUNITY POLICING,APPLYING THE OFFICERS,
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'REFROM, APPLYING THEM TO ONE
COMMUNITY LONG ENOUGH TO DEVELOPRELATIONSHIPS AND GET TO KNOW
THE COMMUNITY.
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGSTHAT CREATE TRUST, MUTUAL
RESPECT, THAT KEEPS COMMUNITIESAND OFFICERS SAFER.
>> Jon: THE OTHER THING THATBOTHERS ME, THEY WANT TO GO TO
END OF THE LINE OF THE SUPPLYCHAIN BUT NEVER WANT TO DEAL
WITH, YOU KNOW, WHY AREN'T WEDOWN IN FLORIDA, SOUTH CAROLINA,
GEORGIA WHERE THESE GUNS ARECOMING FROM AND STOPPING AND
FRISKING GUN STORES?
WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT ANDSOMEHOW PUT IT ALL ON
COMMUNITIES WHEN THE TRUTH ISTHERE IS A GUN-RUNNING OPERATION
THAT IS GOING ON IN THE SOUTHTHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT, BUT
NOBODY WILL IN ANY WAY ADDRESS.
>> THIS IS A FIGHT WE HAVE TOUNDERTAKE IN OUR COUNTRY.
ASK THE LEADERSHIP, THE NYPD,THEY WILL TELL YOU A SINGLE GUN
RECENTLY CAME OUT OF GEORGIA,RECIRCULATED FROM CRIME TO
CRIME, USED IN VARIOUS SHOOTINGSAROUND THE CITY, ONE GUN.
>> Jon: I'VE HEARD OF THAT,THE ZIP GUN PROGRAM.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU GET THE GUN, USE IT FORA CRIME AND OBVIOUSLY BRING IT
BACK AND SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNSIT OUT.
>> VERY SOPHISTICATED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT'S ABOUT RESOURCE --
BUT AGAIN, THEY KNOW THIS! ANDTHEY KNOW THE PLACES THAT ARE
DOING THIS, THEY KNOW PEOPLETHAT ARE DOING IT BUT THEY ARE
UNABLE TO -- FOR ALL THESURVEILLANCE AND INFORMATION WE
HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU'RETELLING US YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE STUFF IS COMING FROM ANDWE CAN'T STOP IT?
>> IT'S A POLITICAL WILLQUESTION.
LOOK, IF I WAS GOING TO THINKABOUT THE BIG STRUCTURE OF HOW
TO GET PROGRESSIVE CHANGE ON ANISSUE LIKE THAT, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO GET TO CREATOR UNIT AS ANATION ON AN ISSUE LIKE GUN
CONTROL TILL WE DEAL WITHECONOMIC REALITY FIRST.
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED WHEN YOUGET TO PROGRESSIVE ECONOMICS,
YOU WILL UNIT PEOPLE ACROSSREGIONS AND DIFFERENT
BACKGROUNDS AND FAITHS AND THATMAY BE THE BEGINNING OF A MORE
COMMON POLITICS AND COMMON SETOF VALUES THAT SOMEDAY MAY LEAD
TO THE REALIZATION THAT PEOPLEWHO WANT THE RESPECT OR THE
RIGHT TO HAVE A FIREARM, THATDOES NOT HAVE TO EQUATE WITH A
SITUATION THAT LEADS TO FIREARMSENDING UP IN OUR STREETS,
KILLING PEOPLE IN THE HANDS OFCRIMINALS.
THAT WILL TAKE A LOT OFTRANSCENDENCE AND WORK, BUT I
THINK ECONOMICS IS THE MOSTUNIFYING FORCE.
>> Jon: IS THE WAY TO DO IT,THEN, TO SAY WE HAVE TO CREATE
ECONOMIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITIESTHAT CAN COMBAT THE UNDERGROUND
ECONOMIES IN THE COMMUNITIES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: IF I'M 10 YEARS OLDAND I HAVE A CRAPPY PANTS AND
SHIRT AND SEE SOME OTHER KIDTHAT DOESN'T, I WILL BE OFF
AND THINK, THAT'S THE ONLY WAYOUT.
YOU HAVE TO FIND AN ECONOMIC WAYTO COMPETE WITH THAT TO GIVE ANY
HOPE TO IT.
>> THAT'S IT, EXACTLY.
WHAT HAPPENED IN BALTIMORE, PARTOF IT WAS POLICE COMMUNICATIONS,
BUT A LOT ECONOMIC REALITY.
IF YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY OFPEOPLE WHO HAVE RARELY SEEN
CONSISTENT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY,YOU CANNOT BE SURPRISED IF THAT
COMMUNITY IS IN MANY WAYSDISCONNECTED FROM THE LARGER
SOCIETY AROUND IT.
IF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL A SENSE OFECONOMIC HOPE, UNFORTUNATELY
THAT'S WHERE CRIME BREEDS, WHEREGANGS BREED.
KIDS THAT KNOW THEY HAVEOPPORTUNITY AHEAD ARE MUCH LESS
ATTRACTED TO GANGS.
ONE TIME I WAS IN THE SOUTHBRONX AND A FORMER GANG MEMBER
SAID SOMETHING SIMPLE TO ME.
HE SAID RECOGNIZE THE FACT A LOTOF KIDS IF THEY'RE CONVINCED
THERE'S NO HOPE UP AHEAD THEY'RENOT GETTING TO COLLEGE OR A
CAREER, THEN A GANG LOOKSATTRACTIVE, LOOKS LIKE A FAMILY
AND A HOME.
WE HAVE TO SHOW YOUNG PEOPLETHERE IS A WAY FORWARD TO A
DECENT FUTURE.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE SAMECONVERSATION WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
HAVING ABOUT CALTIMORE 40 YEARSAGO.
LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC POLICIESHAVE BEEN IN PLACE IN THOSE
AREAS.
THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THING,WE HAVE TO BRING THE AREAS HOPE
AND OPPORTUNITY, AND YET --
>> WELL, HERE'S THE PROBLEMTHAT WE JUST DEFINED A MOMENT
AGO.
IF -- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GOINGBACKWARDS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILYGOING BACKWARDS.
IF YOU'RE IN A POOR COMMUNITY,THAT'S HITTING YOU HARDER.
WAGES HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THECOST OF LIVING.
OPPORTUNITY IS MORE CONSTRAINED.
WE'RE IN THE STRONG GROWTH AREASIN THE ECONOMY, WALM-MART AND
OTHER PLACES THAT PAY A VERY LOWWAGE.
SO, NO, WE HAVE NOT.
WE'VE INVESTED IN CERTAINPROGRAMS, SOME WORKED BETTER,
SOME WORSE, BUT WE HAVNE'T BUITAN ECONOMY THAT'S ACTUALLY
INCLUSIVE.
>> Jon: WHAT'S NICE IS ITSHOWS IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS.
THEY TALK ABOUT TRICKLE DOWNECONOMICS.
POVERTY TRICK ALSO DOWN, NOTRICHES.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEENEXPERIENCING FOR A LONG TIME AND
THAT'S WHY ADDRESSING INCOMEINEQUALITY HEAD ON, TALKING
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CURRENTPOLITICAL REALITY IS JUST NOT
WORKING IS WHERE WE'LL FIND ABREAKTHROUGH.
>> Jon: THEN YOU WILL FEELLIKE YOU'RE GOING TO STAY --
>> I SAID INCOME INEQUALITY NOTHEIGHT INEQUALITY.
>> Jon: SON OF A BITCH.
