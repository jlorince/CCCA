(LAUGHTER) BUT FOR WISCONSINITES, TODAY'S RECALL ELECTION SPOKE TO A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED DEMOCRACY ITSELF.
WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
>> SCOTT WALKER BECAME GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN IN 2010.
HIS TERM DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL 2014 BUT THAT JUST ISN'T SOON
ENOUGH FOR DEMOCRATS LIKE JEREMY LEVIN SON WHO COLLECTED ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO FORCE TODAY'S
RECALL ELECTION.
>> IT'S A HARD THING TO DO TO GET A RECALL ELECTION.
THE CONSTITUTION SETS A THRESHOLD REQUIRING A GREAT NUMBER OF SIGNATURES.
>> WHAT'S IT, LIKE, 80% OF THE POPULATION?
>> WELL, THE WAY THE NUMBER IS STABLISHD IS THEY REQUIRE 25%E OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT
VOTED IN THE LAST GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION.
>> WAIT, SO YOU ONLY NEED 25%?
WHY NOT JUST HAVE THE RECALL PETITIONS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE VOTING BOOTH, GET PEOPLE TO SIGN
THEM THEN.
YOU'D SAVE WISCONSIN TONS OF MONEY.
>> THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES WE WAIT ONE YEAR BEFORE STARTING THE RECALL PROCESS.
>> (BLEEP) THAT.
RECALL THE CONSTITUTION.
(LAUGHTER) LOOK, IT'S A PROCESS.
OVER A MILLION WISCONSINITES SIGNED A PETITION.
A MILLION PLUS WISCONSINITES CAN'T BE WRONG.
>> BUT APPARENTLY ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE
CAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY VOTED FOR SCOTT WACHNER 2010.
I'M CONFUSED.
DID HE BREAK THE LAW?
WAS HE CAUGHT WITH PROSTITUTES?
>> NO.
THE RECALL PROCESS IS A SAFETY VALVE ON THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES DURING A
FOUR-YEAR TERM WHERE WHOEVER WAS ELECTED...
>> SO WHEN YOU SAY IT'S "RARE CIRCUMSTANCES" YOU MEAN WHEN
SOMEBODY GETS ELECTED YOU DON'T AGREE WITH?
(LAUGHTER)
>> UM...
(LAUGHTER).
>> Reporter: THE DEMOCRATS' ACTIONS HAVE INFURIATED MANY IN
THE STATE LIKE REPUBLICAN ISAAC WEEKS.
>> THEY'RE RECALLING A GOVERNOR WHO WAS PUT INTO OFFICE WITH THE
MAJORITY OF THE VOTE AND DID WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO.
>> I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
PEOPLE MIGHT HATE WALKER.
WALKER MIGHT BE (BLEEP).
WALKER MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE GOVERNOR.
HE MIGHT BE AN IDIOT BUT HE WON.
YOU DON'T JUST RECALL EVERY DUMB PERSON BECAUSE THEY'RE A DUMB PERSON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> BUT THE REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING BACK.
>> I'M RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT IN THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE.
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT.
YOU'RE RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT?
>> YES.
>> SO YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN RUNNING AS A FAKE DEMOCRAT...
>> DON'T USE "FAKE DEMOCRAT."
>> BUT YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT.
>> EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING DONE IS PERFECTLY LEGAL.
>> IT IS CERTAINLY AN UNABASHED ATTEMPT TO DEFRAUD THE VOTERS.
>> SO THEY WERE MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM.
AND HOW IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING DIFFERENT?
>> UM... INSTEAD OF THE PHRASE "MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM" I
THINK I'D PREFER EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PETITION FOR A RECALL ELECTION.
>> WHILE THIS STRAIGHT-LACED REPUBLICAN STILL HAS A WAYS TO GO TO BECOMING A PRESENTABLE DEMOCRAT...
>> LATTE.
>> LATTE?
>> LATTE.
>> LATTE.
>> LATTE.
>> VAMPIRE WEEKEND.
>> VAMPIRE WEEKEND.
>> ...AT LEAST THIS RECALL PROCESS HAS SHOWN THAT WE HAVE TWO POLITICAL PARTIES THAT ARE
BOTH ETHICAL AND MATURE.
>> THE REPUBLICANS STARTED IT.
>> WELL, THE DEMOCRATS STARTED IT.
>> IT'S CERTAINLY SLEAZY, IT'S CERTAINLY OFFENSIVE.
>> IT'S A SLEAZY, UNDERHANDED THING TO RECALL A GOVERNMENT.
>> THEY'RE CHEATING.
>> THEY'RE WASTING A BUNCH OF MONEY.
>> IT'S A GOOD BIT OF WHINING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
>> I THINK THEY'RE BEING WHINEY BABIES.
>> BUT THEY DID AGREE ON ONE THING.
>> THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS.
>> THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION.
>> JUST AS OUR FORE FATHERS INTENDED.
RIGHT, I GET IT.
IT'S LIKE WHEN I VOTE I'M EXERCISING MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, BUT WHEN SOMEONE THAT I
DON'T AGREE WITH VOTES THEY'RE MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM.
WHY DON'T PEOPLE SEE THAT?
>> I MEAN, LOOK, THE RECALL IS... I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SEEN AS AN UNUSUAL BUT
BREATHTAKING EXERCISE OF DEMOCRACY.
>> NOW WHEN YOU SAY "BREATHTAKING" DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE... OR DO YOU MEAN...
(LAUGHTER) (GASPING) CAN'T, BREATHE.
>> NO, I MEAN INSPIRING.
>> (GASPING)
>> NO, BREATH TAKING IN THE SENSE OF BEING INSPIRED.
>> (GASPING)
> ARE YOU OKAY?ING.>
>> THANKS, WISCONSIN, FOR INSPIRING US ALL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: WYATT
