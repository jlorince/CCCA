EASY GIRL, LET'S SEE WHATHAPPENS IN THE PRIMARY.
OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T BE AHUCKABEE SPEECH WITHOUT SOME
THEOCRATIC DEMAGOGUE-A-GOO.
>> WE ARE NOW THREATENING THEFOUNDATION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY
BY CRIMINALIZING CHRISTIANITYAND DEMANDING THAT WE
ABANDON BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES OFNATURAL MARRIAGE.
MANY OF OUR POLITICIANS HAVESURRENDERED TO THE FALSE
GOD OF JUDICIAL SUPREMACY.
