COURSE.

[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: TRUTH IS I ONLY COMETO THIS [BLEEP] HOLE WHEN I HAVE
TO.
WOW, THAT WASN'T A FREUDIANSLIP, THAT WAS A FREUDIAN STAGE
DIVE.
THE ONLY WAY THAT COULD HAVEBEEN MORE FREUDIAN IS IF ROBERTS
BLURTED OUT THAT HE AVOIDS THESTATE BECAUSE HIS HOT MOM LIVES
THERE.[LAUGHTER]
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO GO TOSLEEP TONIGHT.
IT SEEMS LIKE ROBERTS'S AGONER.
HITS ONLY HOPE IS HISCHALLENGER, MILTON WOLF, TEA

SOCIOPATH.

RESEMBLED A WOUND ALIEN IN A"TERMINATOR" FILM.
>> Jon: THAT'S [BLEEPED]OUTRAGEOUS.
FORGET ABOUT INSENSITIVITY.
HOW DO YOU ELECT A GUY WHOTHINKS TERMINATORS ARE ALIENS?
THEY'RE NOT.
THEY'RE TIME-TRAVELING CYBORGS.
THEY WERE MADE ON EARTH IN OURFUTURE.
DID YOU EVEN SEE THE [BLEEPED]MOVIE?
THAT IS DISQUALIFYING.
[APPLAUSE]I'M SORRY.
THANKFULLY IN A VICTORY FORNERDS EVERYWHERE, SENATOR
ROBERTS DEFEATED MR. "I CAN'T BEBOTHERED WITH THE DETAILS OF
CINEMA'S GREATEST ALTERNATEFUTURE SCI-FI THRILLER SERIES."
FROM THE PRIMARIES, WE MOVE ONTO THE GENERAL ELECTION,
AND ONE OF THIS YEAR'S CLOSESTWATCHED SENATE RACES.
IN KENTUCKY, NAMED FOR ITSLUBE-STREWN HILLS AND MOUNTAINS,
AND WHERE 134-YEAR-OLD POLITICALTRADITION CONTINUES.
>> 15,000 POLITICAL ACTIVISTS,CANDIDATES AND VOTERS, IN WHAT
IS T MOST UNFORGETTABLECAMPAIGN SPECTACLE KENTUCKY
HAS TO OFFER, THE ANNUAL FANCYFARM PICNIC IS UNDER WAY.
>> Jon: FANCY FARM PICNIC,THEY DON'T SERVE FANCY FEAST AT
THIS FARM, DO THEY?
BECAUSE NOT THEY WOULDN'T LOVETO SEE MITCH McCONNELL EATING
CAT FOOD FROM A CRYSTAL BOWL,HASHTAG "CAT-CONNELLING," NOT
SURE THAT'S GOING TO CATCH ON.
THE FANCY FARM IS A RAMBUNCIOUSAFFAIR WHERE CANDIDATES ARE
ENCOURAGED TO ROAST EACH OTHERFROM THE PODIUM.
LET'S HEAR FROM McCONNELL'SCHALLENGER, KENTUCKY SECREATARY
OF STATE, ALISON LUNDERGRANGRIMES.
>> WHEN YOU FINALLY SEE SENATORMcCONNELL ON THE SAME STAGE,
YOU REALIZE ONLY ONE OF USBELIEVES WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY
FOR EQUAL WORK.
IF MITCH McCONNELL WERE A TVSHOW, HE'D BE "MAD MEN,"
TREATING WOMEN UNFAIRLY, STUCKIN 1968 AND ENDING THIS SEASON.
>> Jon: AND ALWAYS BUMPING OUTTO END CREDIT WITH AN IRONICALLY
UPBEAT SONG, AND THEN PREVIEWINGNEXT WEEK THE TELLS YOU NOTHING
AND MITCH McCONNELL WOULD AIRSUNDAYS AT 10:00 ON AMC, BUT NOT
NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE ON AMID-SEASON HIATUS, WHICH IS
SOMETHING AMC DOES LIKE WITH"BREAKING BAD."
ANYWAY, MY POINT IS THIS: MITCHMcCONNELL IS SIMILAR TO THAT
SHOW.[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT WASN'T GRIMES MATERIALTHAT I LIKED, EVEN THOUGH I DID
LIKE IT, IT WAS SENATORMcCONNELL'S REACTIONS TO HER
MATERIAL.
>> IT'S NOT EASY BEING MITCHMcCONNELL.
AFTER THREE DECADES INWASHINGTON, YOU'VE JUST GIVEN
UP.
I INTEND TO HOLD YOUACCOUNTABLE, AND I DON'T NEED
HOUND DOGS TO TRACK YOU DOWN.
THANK YOU.
>> Jon: HE DOESN'T EVEN MOVE.
NOT, NOT A SINGLE TWITCH,NOTHING.
EITHER MITCH McCONNELL HAS,THROUGH YEARS LONG PRACTICE OF
CONTROLLED BREATHING AND ZENMEDITATION ACHIEVED A DEEP,
METABOLISM SLOWING TRANSSTATE ORTHAT MAN IS DEAD INSIDE.
BROTHER, SHE'S RIPPING YOU TOSHREDS.
BLINK.
HIS REACTIONS ARE SOINSCRUTABLE, YOU COULD USE THEM
FOR ANYTHING.
>> WHAT'S IN THE BOX.
WHAT'S IN THE BOX?
OH, GOD.
>> Jon: OR...
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE ALLGOING TO GET LAID!
>> Jon: OR, I SURE WOULD LIKETHE HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS.
[LAUGHTER]FOLLOWING A GOLF MATCH.
YEP.
WELL, WE'VE HEARD GRIMES THROWDOWN.
YOUR MOVE, McCONNELL.
>> OBAMA WOULDN'T GO DOWN TO THEBORDER.
HE SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE PHOTOOPS.
HE'S TAKEN MORE SELFIES THANFLAT STANLEY.
>> Jon: FLAT STANLEY DOESN'TTAKE SELFIES.
FLAT STANLEY IS A PIECE OFPAPER.
[LAUGHTER]MR. STANLEY ASKS SECOND PARTIES
TO TAKE THOSE PHOTOS ON HISBEHALF.
THEY'RE NOT SELFIES.
WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS WITH YOUGUYS.
THANK GOD KENTUCKY'S OTHERSENATOR RABID PAUL STOPPED BY TO
RESTORE SOME DIGNITY TO THEPROCEEDINGS.
>> THERE ONCE WAS A WOMAN FROMKENTUCKY...
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: IF YOU SAY WHOSE[BLEEPED] WAS SO LONG SHE COULD
SUCKY, I-I WILL MAKE YOU THE NEWPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> THERE ONCE WAS A WOMAN FROMKENTUCKY, WHO THOUGHT IN
POLITICS SHE'D BE LUCKY.
SO SHE FLEW TO L.A. FOR AHOLLYWOOD BASH.
SHE CAME HOME IN A FLASH WITHBUCKETS OF CASH.
ONE THING THAT WE KNOW IS TRUE,ONE THING WE KNOW IS GUARANTEED,
SHE'D CAST HER FIRST VOTE FORHARRY REID.
>> Jon: THERE ONCE WAS A MANNAMED RAND PAUL.
HIS LIMERICK SKILLS SUCKED MYBALLS.
HIS COIF WAS SO CURLY, HIS PROSEMADE ME SURLY --
BALLS, BALLS, BALLS, BALLS.
HEY, I WONDER HOW SENATORMcCONNELL LIKED MY POEM.
[LAUGHTER]
