>> Jon: WE BEGIN TONIGHT
WITH A VIRAL VIDEO THAT HAS
BEEN MAKING THE ROUNDS.
YESTERDAY IT FINALLY DROPPED
AND IT IS AS ADVERTISED, IT
IS FILTHY.
>> WE'RE FINALING
GHEITING-- GET AND UP CLOSE
LOOK AT THE OIL GUSHING INTO
THE GULF OF MEXICO.
>> Jon: OH, YEAH, I LIKE MY
VIDEO OF RUPTURED OIL LINES
LIKE I LIKE MY COFFEE, BLACK
AND FULL OF DEAD SEA
ANIMALS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THEY TOLL
US OIL WAS LEAKING INTO THE
GULF.
THEY DIDN'T SAY IT WAS
BLASTING INTO THE GULF IN AN
OIL GEYSER.
WE'RE POWER WASHING THE GULF
OF MECK COWITH OIL.
I THOUGHT WE HAD PUT THAT
THING OUT WITH A GIANT
CONCRETE DOME AND SEALED IT
ALL UP.
>> A GIANT DOME EXPERIMENT
ENDED IN A GIANT FAILURE.
>> Jon: WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: PUTTING A DOME OVER
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO FORGET
DIDN'T WORK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT WORKED SO WELL
FOR DETROIT AND THE LIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: KIDDING, JIDING,
IT'S YOUR YEAR.
BUT DON'T WORRY, THEY GOT A
NEW PLAN.
AND THIS TIME IT'S
FOOLPROOF.
NOT LIKE THAT STUPID GIANT
DOME IDEA.
>> THE SOLUTION FOR THIS IS
TO TRY A SMALLER DOME.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE MAYANS WERE
RIGHT.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!
MAYBE THIS SMALLER DOME IS A
MINIATURE, MORE HIGH-TECH
INTRICATE PIECE OF
TECHNOLOGY.
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT.
>> A SMALLER CONTAINMENT BOX
CALLED A TOP HAT.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD,
NOSTRADAMUS WAS RIGHT, WE'RE
ALL GOING TO DIE.
YES, A TOP HAT WHAT A GREAT
IDEA.
I MEAN IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT KEEPS MR. PEANUT FROM
SPEWING DEADLY PEANUT JUICE
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: PRAY TELL, WHAT IF
THE TOP HAT DOESN'T WORK?
>> IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
LATER IN THE WEEK THEY WILL
TRY THE HOT TAP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE TOP HAT DOESN'T
WORK WE'LL GOING TO TRY THE
HOT TAP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU'RE NOT COMING UP WITH
NEW IDEAS, YOU'RE JUST
SCRAMBLING LETTERS AROUND!
OUR SOLUTION TO THIS IS TO
COME UP WITH ANAGRAMS, OH,
NO, WAIT, WE GOT OUR BEST
GUY ON IT, HIS NAME IS PAT
THO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YES, YES, HE'S
DEVELOPED A PATH TO THE
CLEANUP USING-- OH THPTA-O.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S STOP SCREWING AROUND.
>> AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
NEXT WEEK THEY WILL TRY THE
JUNK SHOT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I WAS ONCE
GETTING OUT OF A LIMO AND
PAPARAZZI MANAGED TO GET A
JUNK SHOT OF MY--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: FUNNY NOW BUT
EVERY-- THAT WAS HOW I LOST
MY NICKELODEON SHOW
ISTEWBEEF.
ALL RIGHT, JUNK SHOT SOUNDS
A LITTLE SILLY BUT I'M SURE
IT IS SOMETHING HIGHLY
TECHNICAL AND ADVANCED.
>> THE JUNK SHOT, LITERALLY
FIRING DEBRIS, GOLF BALLS
AND TIRE SHARDS INTO THE
LEAKING PIPE HOPING TO CLOG
IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: [BLEEP] WITH US,
RIGHT S THAT-- WHY DO I HAVE
A FEELING THAT THE BEST
MINDS IN THE SCIENCE WORLD
WERE WORKING ON GETTING THE
OIL.
BUT THE STOPPING THE OIL
DEPARTMENT, MAYBE A LITTLE
SMALLER, LITTLE LESS WELL
FINANCED.
WHAT IF THE SPACE PROGRAM
RAN THAT WAY.
HEY, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO
PUT A MAN ON THE MOON.
YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU WANTED
HIM BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, WAIT, I
GOT AN IDEA.
WHAT IF WE SHOOT GOLF BALLS
AND PIECES OF TIRE AT THE
MOON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: MAKE LIKE A GARBAGE
LADDER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SO IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE
PROBLEM.
CAN WE AT LEAST FIGURE OUT
WHO [BLEEP]ED IT UP IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
BP AMERICAN CHAIRMAN LAMAR
McKAY.
ISN'T IT TRUE THE SPILL IN
QUESTION CAME FROM YOUR OIL
WELL, OWNED BY YOU.
>> BP AS THE LEASEHOLDER AND
THE OPERATOR OF THE WELL
HIRED TRANSOCEAN TO DRILL
THAT WELL.
TRANSOCEAN AS OWNER AND
OPERATORS OF THE DEEP WATER
HORIZON DRILLING RIG HAD
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY
OF DRILLING OPERATIONS.
>> Jon: AHA!, TRANSOCEAN.
I KNEW!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: STEVE NEWMAN
PRESIDENT & CEO OF THE
TRANSOCEAN, ISN'T IT TRUE
THIS IS YOUR FAULT?
>> ON THE EVENING OF APRIL
20th, THERE WAS A SUDDEN
CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE
CEMENT, THE CASING OR BOTH.
WITHOUT A FAILURE OF ONE OF
THOSE ELEMENTS, THE
EXPLOSION COULD NOT HAVE
OCCURRED.
>> Jon: NEWMAN!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT WASN'T TRANSOCEAN,
IT WAS THE CEMENT CASING.
AND WHO PROVIDED THE CEMENT
CASING?
NO!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I THINK MICHAEL
MOORE JUST HAD AN ORGASM.
BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I THINK IF I'M NOT
MISTAKEN, I BELIEVE WE HAVE
FOOTAGE OF THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT,
HALLIBURTON, WE FINALLY GOT
YOU.
ALTHOUGH IT'S A LITTLE LIKE
GETTING CAPONE ON TAX
EVASION BUT WE'LL TAKE IT.
THE CHIEF HEALTH SAFETY AND
ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICER OF
HALLIBURTON, REALLY, THEY
HAVE ONE OF THOSE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: DIDN'T YOU CEMENT
THE CASING SHOE.
>> THE CASING SHOE WAS
CEMENTED SOME 20 HOURS PRIOR
TO THE TRAGIC INCIDENT.
AND HAD THE BOP FUNCTIONED
AS EXPECTED, THIS
CATASTROPHE MAY WELL NOT
HAVE OCCURRED.
>> Jon: DO ANY OF THESE OIL
[BLEEP] HAVE HAIR, ANY OF
THEM?
OH T WASN'T THE CEMENT
CASING, THE BOP
MALFUNCTIONED.
THE BLOWOUT PREVENTER, OF
COURSE.
>> IT HAS BEEN A FEW YEARS
SINCE I HAVE BEEN OUT ON A
RIG BUT QUESTION ONLY ASSUME
THAT SOMEHOW THE HYDRAULIC
RAMS FAILED TO CLOSE AROUND
THE DRILL STRING OR POSSIBLY
AT CUMMULATERS DAMAGED BY
EXTREME INTERNAL FRICTION
CAUSED MICROFRACTIONS
LEADING TO SYSTEM
MALFUNCTION, THAT WOULD BE A
HARD PROBLEM TO CATCH AHEAD
OF TIME.
>> THE ONE CONTROL PANEL WE
DID FIND, THE BATTERY WASN'T
WORKING, CORRECT?
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LEAD
TO BELIEVE, YES.
>> Jon: YOU GOT TO BE
[BLEEP] KIDDING ME.
SO WHAT COULD BE THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE OF
THE DECADE OCCURRED BECAUSE
A DEAD BATTERY THAT YOU KNEW
OF IN THE CONTROL PANEL.
I GUESS WHEN ARE YOU LIVING
OUT ON AN OIL RIG IT IS KIND
OF A TOUGH CHOICE.
HEY, THE TV REMOTE'S DEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
I GUESS WE JUST SWITCH OUT
THE BATTERY OF THE ONE ON
THE CONTROL PANEL.
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT COULD
HAPPEN.
>> Jon: SO THE GOVERNMENT IS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
HAPPENED.
THEY ARE IN FRONT OF A
SENATE COMMITTEE BUT ISN'T
THERE A GOVERNMENT ARM
THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR
POLICING THESE COMPANIES AND
DOES STRENUOUS SAFETY AND
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDIES
ON ANYONE APPLYING TO DRILL
IN THE GULF?
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED THE
MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE.
>> IN AN INITIAL EXPLORATION
PLAN B P CALLED THE SPILL,
QUOTE, UNLIKELY.
SO WHEN BP SOUGHT PERMISSION
TO DRILL THE DEEP WATER
HORIZON SITE, MPS AGREED AND
WENT ALONG WITH IT.
AND GAVE THE COMPANY A,
QUOTE, CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION
FROM A MORE STRENUOUS
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: CHUCK, BEFORE I BLOW
A GASKET, LOWER THE TOP HAT.
(LAUGHTER)
