[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION
STRANGLING OUR ECONOMY AND NOW
MAYBE THREATENING ONE OF OUR
MOST ADORABLE INDUSTRIES.
OLIVIA MUNN HAS MORE.
>> LAST TUESDAY'S ELECTION
SEEMED TO BE A VICTORY FOR
SMALLER GOVERNMENT UNTIL YOU
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN
MISSOURI.
>> PROP B ALSO KNOWN AS THE
PUPPY MILL CRUELTY PREVENTION
ACT.
>> IT PASSED WITH 52% OF THE YES
VOTE.
AND THIS LAW REGULATING PUPPY
MILLS, ITS FACTORY FARMS OF DOG
BREEDING IS BIG GOVERNMENT AT
ITS WORSE ACCORDING TO ANITA
ANDREWS.
>> IT'S SIMILAR TO OBAMA CARE.
>> HOW SO?
>> THEY ARE EXPECTING ALL THE
BREEDERS TO SIT THERE AND PAY
FOR EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF CARE
THAT ARE NOT NEEDED LIKE
ADEQUATE FOOD, ADEQUATE WATER,
ADEQUATE SPACE.
>> THIS LAW WOULD FORCE BREEDERS
TO KEEP DOG AS LIVE IS WORSE
THAN OBAMA CARE.
>> ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WANT
TOLL PROHIBIT STACKING YET WE
STACK HUMANS.
>> WHEN DO WE STACK HUMANS?
WE STACK THEM IN APARTMENTS ALL
THE TIMES IN ALL THE CITIESEN I
SYNC WHILE MOST -- IN ALL THE
CITIES.
>> I SEE WHILE MOST APARTMENTS
DON'T ALLOW THE NEIGHBORS TO
(bleep) ON YOUR HEAD, POINT
TAKEN.
>> IT'S ONE MORE STEP TO MAKE US
A COMMUNIST, SOCIALIST SOCIETY.
>> DON'T BELIEVE HER?
GUESS WHO IS BEHIND IT?
THE SOCIETY FOR A PROMOTION OF
COMMUNIST AGENDA.
>> A PUPPY HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BECOMING A COMMUNIST
COUNTRY.
IT'S A BILL TO PROTECT PUPPIES
WHO CAN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES,
SOMETHING MORE NOTHING LESS.
>> WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM AN
ORGANIZATION WHOSE JOB IS THE
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH OR IN
THIS CASE PUPPY.
THEY DON'T VALLEY -- VALUES THE
PUPPIES AS YOU SHOULD.
IF YOU HAVE TO EARN MONEY TO BUY
YOUR PUPPY WOULD YOU BE MORE
LIKELY TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR
PUPPY.
>> THIS GROUP BELIEVES ALL DOGS
DESERVE A HOME EQUALLY WHILE
SOME LIVE WELL AND OTHERS
SURVIVE ON FREE GOVERNMENT
WATER.
>> IF A ADOPT FROM A SHELTER I
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF
DOG BECAUSE WE DON'T TAKE IT.
>> WE'LL TAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS I
WANT.
>> WHY WOULD I GIVE YOU MONEY
IT'S FREE.
>> WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE VALUE
OF DOG.
>> THIS FEELS LIKE CHINA.
>> THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH BASIC KINDNESS TO CREATURES
THAT CAN'T GET IT FOR
THEMSELVES.
>> SHE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO SOLVE
THIS PROBLEM.
>> IT'S MAY SHE'S JUST -- SHE'S
REALLY FRUSTRATING ME AND I NEED
HELP.
>> SHE'S A FEMALE.
>> YES.
TECHNICALLY YOU CALL HER A
BITCH.
SHE'S COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
>> YOU DON'T TRY TO BE THE PACK
LEADER.
YOU ARE THE PACK LEADER.
HAVE YOU DONE THAT?
I WEAR A SUIT.
I HAVE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
>> YOU ASK IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
TO YOUR DOG?
>> NO.
>> TO MADDIE RIGHT HERE.
>> I THOUGHT SHE WAS YOUR
PRODUCER?
>> NO SHE'S A CRAZY LADY.
>> I'M TRYING TO BAN PUPPY
MILLS.
>> A DEGREE WITH THAT.
>> DO YOU?
>> PUPPY MILLS ARE THE WRONG WAY
IF AMERICA CALLS ITSELF A DOG
LOVER WE MUST TREAT DOGS
HUMANELY.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA.
>> SHHH.
>> PACK LEADERS COMMENTS ARE --
[LAUGHTER]
EVEN THE DOG WHISPERER COULDN'T
SEE WHAT THIS LAW WAS DOING TO
OUR COUNTRY.
WAKE UP, AMERICA, BEFORE THIS
