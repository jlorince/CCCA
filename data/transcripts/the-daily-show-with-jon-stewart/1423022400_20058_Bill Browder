PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM BILL BROWDER! SIR!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
THANK YOU FOR JOININGUS ON THE PROGRAM!
THIS IS A CRAZY STORY.
THE WHOLE THING IS CRAZY.
"RED NOTICE, TRUE STORY OF AHIGH FINANCE, MURDER AND ONE
MAN'S FIGHT FOR JUSTICE."
YOU'RE THE ONE MAN.
>> I'M THAT MAN.
>> Jon: YOU GO, SO YEARS AGO YOUSEE OPPORTUNITY IN THE FALL OF
THE SOVIETS IN EASTERN EUROPEFOR INVESTMENTS AS A LOT OF
AMERICANS DID.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND YOU BUILD ABUSINESS THERE.
>> I DID.
>> Jon: AND THINGS ARE GOINGWELL.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND THEN THEY KICK YOUOUT OF THE COUNTRY.
>> THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
SO I WAS ON A FLIGHT.
I HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR TENYEARS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I WAS ACTUALLY THE LARGESTINVESTOR -- FOREIGN INVESTOR IN
RUSSIA AND I WAS ON AFLIGHT COMING FROM LONDON --
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> BACK TO MOSCOW AND I
ARRIVED AT THE VIP LOUNGE AT THESHEREMETYEVO AIRPORT WHICH IS
THE MOSCOW AIRPORT --
>> Jon: LOOK AT YOU!
VIP LOUNGE! NICE!
(LAUGHTER)>> SO I ARRIVE THERE, AND IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE, YOU KNOW, YOUKNOW, A FIVE MINUTES IN AND OUT
TYPE OF THING.
AND THEY HAVE ME SITTING THEREFOR A WHILE.
AND THEN FOUR GUARDS COME IN,GRAB ME BY THE SCRUFF OF MY NECK
AND TAKE ME DOWN TO THEDETENTION CENTER OF THE AIRPORT.
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I WASGOING TO SIBERIA OR WHETHER I
WAS BEING KICKED OUTOF THE COUNTRY.
AND I SIT DOWN THERE FOR ABOUT,OVERNIGHT FOR ABOUT 15 HOURS.
AND THEN THEY GRABBED ME AGAIN,AND I GO, OKAY I DON'T KNOW,
IS THIS GOING OUT TO THEPADDYWAGON OR IS THIS GOING OUT
TO THE PLANE.
THEY STICK ME ONTO A FLIGHT ANDSEND ME TO LONDON AND DECLARED
ME A THREAT TONATIONAL SECURITY.
>> Jon: IN RUSSIA?
BUT THAT IS PROBABLY THE BESTITERATION OF THAT OUTCOME
THAT YOU COULD GET.THAT THEY DRAG YOU DOWN,
THEY TAKE YOU DOWN, THEY HOLDYOU FOR A FEW HOURS
AND THEN THEY GO, LIKE, ALLRIGHT, YOU CAN GO TO LONDON.
>> THE ALTERNATIVES WOULD HAVEBEEN A LOT WORSE.
>> Jon: SO NOW YOU'RETHINKING TO YOURSELF,
WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?
I'M JUST A BUSINESSMAN DOINGSOMETHING.
WHAT DID THEY CHARGE YOU WITH?
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS ISTARTED TO EXPOSE CORRUPTION IN
THE COMPANIES THAT I INVESTEDIN.
AND SO THEY THEN OPENED CRIMINALCASES AGAINST ME, ALL OF MY
COLLEAGUES.
THEY RAIDED MY OFFICE,THEY GRABBED ALL OUR DOCUMENTS,
AND THEN WHAT THE POLICE DOIS THEY TAKE THOSE DOCUMENTS AND
THEY USE THEM IN A VERY COMPLEXSCAM
TO STEAL $230 MILLION OF TAXESWE PAID IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR.
>> Jon: YOU PAID HOW MUCH IN THEPREVIOUS YEAR IN TAXES?
>> $230 MILLION.
>> Jon: ARE YOU STILL TAKINGINVESTORS?
(LAUGHTER)SO THIS IS BASICALLY, YOU FIND
OUT -- WHICH I IMAGINE YOU MUSTHAVE KNOWN THAT WHICH RUSSIA AT
THAT TIME WAS THE WILDWEST OF CAPITALISM,
IT'S A BIT OF A KLEPTOCRACY --
THAT THESE BUSINESSES YOU'REDEALING WITH ARE CORRUPT
AND THEY'RE LAUNDERING MONEYTHROUGH WESTERN BANKS.
AND DO THE WESTERN BANKS KNOWTHIS IS CORRUPT MONEY?
>> THE WESTERN BANKS KNOW THATIT IS CORRUPT MONEY.
SO, SO, YOU HAVE THESE FANCYGUYS WITH THEIR SUITS AND
EVERYTHING AND THEY'RE TAKINGIN THIS MONEY AND THEY KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING ANDTHEY'RE TAKING DIRTY MONEY.
>> Jon: SO WHAT, SO WHAT, SO NOWTHIS WHOLE THING GOES ON,
YOU HAVE A LAWYER AND THIS ISWHERE IT REALLY TAKES
A TRAGIC TURN.
YOU HAVE A LAWYER WHO STAYS INRUSSIA.
>> SO THE POLICE RAID MYOFFICES.
>> Jon: YES.
>> SEIZE OUR COMPANIES, STEALALL THE TAX MONEY THAT WE'VE
PAID AND THEN LAUNDER IT THROUGHTHE WESTERN BANKS
LIKE YOU'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT.
AND I HAVE A YOUNG LAWYER, HE'SA 35 YEARS OLD LAWYER NAMED
SERGEI MAGNITSKY, HE WORKED FORAN AMERICAN LAW FIRM.
HE GOES IN AND HE FIGURES OUTTHE CORRUPTION OF THE PEOPLE
INVOLVED, HE TESTIFIES AGAINSTTHEM, AND THEN THE SAME PEOPLE
HE TESTIFIED AGAINST ARREST HIM,PUT HIM IN JAIL AND TORTURE HIM
FOR 358 DAYS AND KILL HIM FOREXPOSING THEM.
>> Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.
AND SO YOU DECIDE AT THAT POINTYOU WILL CONTINUE THE FIGHT TO
EXPOSE THEM.
>> SO I GOT THE NEWS THE MORNINGAFTER THEY KILLED HIM AND IT WAS
JUST THE WORST POSSIBLE THING ICOULD HAVE EVER HEARD, IT WAS
LIKE A KNIFE GOING INTO MYHEART.
>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I MADEA VOW TO HIM AND TO MYSELF THAT
I WAS GOING TO GET THESE PEOPLEAND MAKE SURE THEY FACED
JUSTICE.
>> Jon: AND THAT IS HOW YOUEND UP PURSUING A LAW THAT HAS
BEEN PASSED, A STATUTE, THATSAYS THAT IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN
THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY OFARRESTING, TORTURING, EXTORTION
THAT YOU GO ON A LIST AND WECAN SEIZE YOUR PASSPORT.
WE COULD --
>> SO, SO MY LAWYER'S NAME WASSERGEI MAGNITSKY.
WE LOBBIED FOR SOMETHING CALLEDTHE MAGNITSKY ACT IN
WASHINGTON.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND BY THE WAY, IT'S THE ONLYTHING, IT PASSED 92 TO 4
IN THE SENATE. IT'S THE ONLYTHING THAT ANYONE COULD AGREE
ON IN WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: JUST OUT OF CURIOUSITY,WHO WERE THE FOUR?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
THERE'S NO RUSSIAN TORTURE ANDMURDER LOBBY IN WASHINGTON
AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S92 IN FAVOR.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.NO, THAT MAKES SENSE.
SO, SO THIS HAS NOW PASSED.
I IMAGINE RUSSIA, THIS MUST BE AVERY DELICATE LAW IN TERMS OF
DIPLOMACY.
DIPLOMACY -- A VERY DELICATE LAWIN TERMS OF DIPLOMACY.
>> YEAH, SO, SO THE GOVERNMENTDOESN'T LIKE TO UPSET THE
RUSSIAN -- OUR GOVERNMENTDOESN'T WANT TO UPSET THE
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. AND SOTHEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING HARD
NOT TO PUT NAMES ON THIS LIST.AND SO IT'S BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE
JUST TO --
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU GET A NAMETO QUALIFY FOR THE LIST AND WHAT
HAPPENS IF YOU END UP ON THELIST?
>> WELL, SO IT'S, BASICALLY, TOGET A NAME ON THE LIST, YOU'VE
GOT TO GIVE THEM A BIG STACK OFINFORMATION AND THEN THEY
HOPEFULLY SAY THAT'SGOOD ENOUGH EVIDENCE.
>> Jon: SO THERE'S A DUEPROCESS?
>> THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A DUEPROCESS.
GETTING YOUR NAME ON THE LIST ISTHE WORST THING THAT COULD
HAPPEN TO YOU AND IT'S A VERYSTRONG SANCTION BECAUSE
WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR NAME IS ONTHE LIST NEXT TO, YOU KNOW,
AL QAEDA MEMBERS AND ALL THESEOTHER TYPE OF BAD GUYS.
>> Jon: OH JESUS.
>> AND SO THERE IS NOT A BANK INTHE WORLD, A U.S. BANK OR A
FOREIGN BANK THAT WILL OPEN ANACCOUNT FOR YOU
WHEN YOUR NAME IS ON THAT LIST.THERE IS NOT A COMPANY
IF THEY HAVE BUSINESS INAMERICA THAT WILL --
>> Jon: BUT IF THE BANKS KNOWTHAT THIS IS DIRTY MONEY,
WHY NOT, SHOULDN'T WE JUST PUTTHE BANKS ALSO ON THE LIST?
(LAUGHTER)CAN'T WE -- IS THERE ANY WAY TO
GO AFTER THEM OR NO?
CAN WE? I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW,THERE WAS THAT, THE BIG CASE
WITH H.S.B.C. WHERE THEYADMITTED YEAH WE'RE LAUNDERING
MONEY FOR DRUG CARTELS, AND YOUKNOW, OOPS, AND THEY PAID A
FINE.
>> YEAH, YEAH. NO, I'M WITH YOU.I MEAN,
THEY PAID A FINE BUT NO GUYS GOTSANCTIONED, NOBODY WENT TO JAIL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I THINK THAT THESE PEOPLESHOULD BEAR A PERSONAL COST.
THERE SHOULD BE CRIMINALLIABILITY FOR ASSISTING --
>> Jon: AT THE CORPORATE LEVELAT THE VERY LEAST.
>> WELL, THE CORPORATE -- YOUCAN'T PUT A CORPORATION IN JAIL
BUT YOU CAN PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT CORPORATIONSARE PEOPLE.
CAN'T WE -- CAN'T WE -- ALRIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)UNBELIEVABLE STORY.
