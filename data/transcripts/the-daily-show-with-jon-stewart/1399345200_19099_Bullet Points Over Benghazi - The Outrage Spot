AND, WHEN THE BUSHADMINISTRATION
PLANTED A STORY ABOUT SADDAMHUSSEIN BUYING ALUMINUM TUBES IN
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SO THAT THESAME DAY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARYOF STATE AND THE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR COULD GO ON TVAND SAY THIS.
>> THERE'S A STORY IN THE "NEWYORK TIMES" THIS MORNING.
REPORTING JUST THIS MORNING.
>> HIGH QUALITY ALUMINUM TUBESTHAT ARE ONLY REALLY SUITED FOR
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS.
>> Jon: THEY KNEW A YEAR INADVANCE THAT WHAT THEY WERE
SAYING ON THE SHOW THAT DAY WASNOT TRUE.
WHERE WAS THAT OUTRAGE?
>> WHERE IS THE APOLOGY FROM THEADMINISTRATION FOR THIS?
>> WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANAPOLOGY.
HINDSIGHT IS ALWAYS 20/20.
>> OF COURSE THEY'S GOING TO BEA DISSENTER. AND SAYING
ALUMINUM TUBES AREN'TNUCLEAR MATERIAL AND THEN
EIGHT OTHERS ARE SAYING IT IS.YOU MAKE A JUDGMENT.
>> IT'S A MATTER OF ASSUMPTION.
>> BUT NOT A QUESTION OF LYING.
>> Jon: NO, IT'S NOT AQUESTION OF LYING. IT'S A
STATEMENT OF LYING.
IT'S NOT AN ASSUMPTIONBECAUSE -- NO, LET ME EXPLAIN,
WHEN YOU ASSUME --[ APPLAUSE ]
-- ALL I KNOW IS WHEN YOU ASSUMEIT MAKES AN ASS OUT OF -- THEY
WERE LYING AND THEY KNEW THEYWERE LYING WHEN THEY SAID THAT.
BUT NOW BENGHAZI AND THE STATEDEPARTMENT AND THE C.I.A. HAD
INFORMATION THAT THINGS WEREDANGEROUS.
SHOULD HAVE HAD MOREPERFECTION. THAT IS
TRUE. MORE PROTECTION. I MEAN,IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE LIKE
SENDING SOLDIERS TO THE FRONTLINES IN A WAR OF CHOICE
WITHOUT PROPERLYUPARMORRED VEHICLES AND NOT ONLY
TAKING WAY TOO LONG TO FIXTHE PROBLEM BUT ANSWERING A
SOLDIER'S QUESTION ABOUT THATPROBLEM LIKE THIS.
>> AS YOU KNOW YOU GO TO WARWITH THE ARMY YOU HAVE AND NOT
THE ARMY YOU MIGHT WANT.
>> Jon: ZING.
I FORGOT JUST HOW MUCH CATCHPHRASES CAME OUT OF IRAQ.
I TELL YOU, THAT THING WAS THELIKE STEVE ERKEL OF WARS. SO,
IF YOU WERE UPSET ABOUT BENGHAZITHAT RUMSFELD THING MUST HAVE
REALLY MASSAGED YOUR O SPOT. YOUKNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOUR OUTRAGE SPOT WHICH TOTALLYDOESN'T EXIST.
>> THEY WANT TO JUMP ON THEMILITARY, THEY WANT TO JUMP ON
DON RUMSFELD, THEY WANT TO JUMPON THE ADMINISTRATION.
IT WAS A PLANT, IT WAS A PLANTBY THE MEDIA.
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S THE REALOUTRAGE OF THAT RUMSFELD QUOTE
THE MEDIA BASTARDS. I MEAN,
WHY WOULD A GUY IN THEFRONTLINES IN IRAQ EVEN BE
CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING APROPERLY UPARMORRED VEHICLE.
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
WAKE UP SHEEP-PLE.
BUT, THAT'S JUST FOX NEWS. I'MSURE OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS
LIKE YOUR LINDSEY GRAHAMS THERE,SEEMINGLY DEDICATED THE REST OF
HIS CAREER TO KEEPING ALIVE THEMEMORY OF THE FOUR WE LOST IN
BENGHAZI WAS JUST AS OUTRAGEDAND EAGER AT THIS FLAGRANT
INABILITY TO PROVIDE FORAMERICANS IN HARM'S WAY.
>> LET'S GET THE PEOPLEWHAT THEY NEED. LET'S
PRESS ON AND LEARN FROM OURPAST MISTAKES.
I DON'T WANT TO PAY POLITICSWITH THIS.
>> Jon: I WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAYA NICE GAME OF PINNACLE. RATHER
THAN PLAY POLITICS,I WOULD RATHER PASS THIS
LOVELY SOUTHERN AFTERNOON BEFORECOLONEL BEUREGARD ARRIVES TO
ESCORT ME TO A BALL AT OURMANOR. I DO DECLARE.
IF I MAY SAY, YOUR HYPOCRITICALOUTRAGE AND SANCTAMONY ASIDE,
THE REASON IT'S HARD FOREVERYONE TO GET OUTRAGED
BY THIS TERRIBLY TRAGIC ANDULTIMATELY PREVENTABLE DISASTER
THAT WAS BENGHAZI, IS THATEVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY
HAS SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE ONLYTHAT MOVIE WAS ON AN IMAX.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
