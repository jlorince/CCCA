THE NFL, OF COURSE,CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH A
BIT OF AN IMAGE PROBLEM.
>> THE NFL, WE CAN'T TRUSTTHESE INSTITUTIONS.
>> INSTITUTION THAT HAS GOTALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS.
>> THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLEINSTITUTION.
>> YOU WILL NEVER FIND AMORE WRETCHED HIVE OF SCUM AND
VILLANY.
>> Jon: NOT SURE THAT LASTPART WAS ABOUT THE NFL, BUT
STILL! NOW WE'VE ALL SEENTHE TAPE OF RAISABLE RAVENS
RUNNINGBACK RAY RICE, ANDWITNESSED THE LEAGUE'S
REACTION.
THE LEAGUE, OF COURSE,DISHED OUT SWIFT, OLD
TESTAMENT STYLE JUSTICE.
IN THE FORM OF A TWO GAMEBAN.
WHICH DUE TO ENORMOUSOUTRAGE AND AN ANOTHER EVEN
MORE EXPLICIT TAPE BECAME ALIFETIME SUSPENSION.
AS WELL AS PERNICIOUS PANTHERSPRO-BALLPLAYER, ACCEPTED AND
NOTED.
GREG HARDY'S CONVICTION ONDOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHARGES
RESULTING IN NO SUSPENSION, ANDTHEN A ONE GAME BENCHING
WITH AN OPTION TO WATCH,FOLLOWED BY THE PANTHERS'S
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT HEIS DONE UNTIL HE APPEALS HIS
MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION FORDOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
IT'S THE KIND OF FIRMDECISION-MAKING WE'VE COME
TO EXPECT FROM PEOPLEWHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
[BLEEP] THEY'RE DOING.
(APPLAUSE)>> BUT DON'T WORRY.
THE NFL HAS FINALLY FIGUREDOUT A SOLUTION TO THEIR
PROBLEMS.
>> THE LEAGUE APPOINTINGFOUR WOMEN INCLUDING A
VICE PRESIDENTOF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO
OVERSEE ITS DOMESTICVIOLENCE EFFORTS.
AND THREE SENIOR ADVISORS,ONE A FORMER HEAD OF
MANHATTAN'S SEX CRIMES UNIT.
>> Jon: SO WE'RE DONE HERE.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW YOUR BUSINESS MODEL
IS IN ROUGH SHAPE WHEN YOUNEED TO APPOINT YOUR OWN
IN-HOUSE SPECIAL VICTIMSUNIT.
(LAUGHTER)ALTHOUGH I'M SURE SEASON TWO
PROMISES BIG SURPRISES.
THERE YOU GO.
BUT LISTEN, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.
NOW WE GOT IT ALL TAKEN CAREOF.
AND WE CAN GO BACK GUILT-FREE TOSPENDING THE LORD'S DAY WATCHING
FOOTBALL, THIS REALTIMEEXPERIMENT IN BUMPER BRAINS.
>> STAR RUNNINGBACK ADRIANPETERSON NOW APOLOGIZING
AFTER HE WAS CHARGED WITHCHILD ABUSE.
>> Jon: [BLEEP](LAUGHTER)
NOT FORMER LEAGUEMVP ADRIAN PETERSON FOR WHOM
I MAY HAVE GIVEN UP A[BLEEP] LOAD TO DRAFT IN MY
FANTASY LEAGUE.
(LAUGHTER)GOD!
WELL, I GUESS THE NFL ISGOING TO HAVE TO FORM A
PANEL OF CHILDREN NOW.
I DON'T-- WHAT DO YOU DO?
>> A WARRANT HAS BEENISSUED FOR PETERSON'S
ARREST.
>> THE CHARGES STEM FROMPETERSON PHYSICALLY
DISCIPLINING HIS SON WITH ATREE BRANCH.
>> PETERSON RELEASED ASTATEMENT SAYING I'M NOT A
PERFECT PARENT BUT I AMWITHOUT A DOUBT NOT A CHILD
ABUSER.
>> Jon: YOU BEAT AFOUR-YEAR-OLD WITH A TREE
BRANCH.
HERE'S A TIP.
FOR ANY PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERSOUT THERE, CURIOUS AS TO
WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAY BECHILD ABUSERS.
YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING TO AFOUR-YEAR-OLD THAT YOU ARE
NOT ALLOWED TO DO TO A 300POUND LINEMAN IN A HELMET
AND PADS.
SO-- (APPLAUSE)
I ASSUME THAT WOULD BE APENALTY.
NOW ONCE AGAIN THE NFL,BASTION OF PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY THAT IT IS,RESPONDED THE RIGHT WAY.
>> PETERSON WILL NOT BEPLAYING IN SUNDAY'S GAME
AGAINST THE PATRIOTS.
>> Jon: OH.
ACTUALLY, USUALLY WHEN I SAYTHINGS IN THAT SORT OF
ARCHED TONE, IT MEANS THATTHE OPPOSITE IS ABOUT TO--
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: OH.
OH.
GOOD FOR YOU, NFL.
>> THE VIKINGS HAVEREINSTATED PETERSON AFTER
BENCHING HIM YESTERDAY.
>> Jon: I KNEW IT!
(LAUGHTER)ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ACTUAL VIKINGS DON'T TREATTHEIR CHILDREN LIKE THAT.
(LAUGHTER)NOW THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEMETAPHORICAL 30 TO 7 BEATING
THAT THE VIKINGS SUFFERED ATTHE HANDS OF THE PATRIOTS
WHO, I WOULD POINT OUT, WONTHE GAME WITHOUT THE
SERVICES OF THEIR ALLEGEDLYDOUBLE MURDERING TIGHT END
AARON HERNANDEZ.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FINE.
ANOTHER TYPICAL SLIMY NFLMOVE, SWEEPING THIS UNDER --
>> OVERNIGHT THE MINNESOTAVIKINGS REVERSED THEIR
DECISION FROM MONDAY'SREINSTATING ADRIAN PETERSON
AND ARE NOW BANNING THEFOOTBALL STAR FROM ALL TEAM
ACTIVITIES AND ADDING WE WANT TOBE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU WHAT?
WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)YOU NEED TIME TO MAKE SURE
YOU GET THIS RIGHT?
A 220 POUND RUNNINGBACK LEFTA RAILROAD TRACK ON A
FOUR-YEAR-OLD'S LEG.
THIS AIN'T FERMAT'S LASTTHEOREM, WHICH IF I MAY SAY, IS
A NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULTNUMEROLOGICAL PROOF
CONCERNING INTEGER THEORY --
I'LL JUST GIVE MYSELF A WEDGIE.
(LAUGHTER)DADDY'S HOME.
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT --(LAUGHTER)
REALLY, I JUST RE-ENACTED MY7th GRADE YEAR.
THAT WAS-- THAT WAS WEIRD.
AND ODDLY CATHARTIC.
SO WHAT OVERNIGHT INFORMATIONCHANGED YOUR MIND THIS TIME?
>> THE LEAGUE'S BIGGESTPARTNER ANHEUSER-BUSCH SENT
A STRONG MESSAGE SAYING WEARE NOT YET SATISFIED WITH
THE LEGAL'S HANDLING OFBEHAVIORS THAT SO CLEARLY GO
AGAINST OUR OWN COMPANYCULTURE AND MORAL CODE.
>> Jon: WOW.
(LAUGHTER)SO THE NFL SUCCUMBS TO BEER
PRESSURE.
THE COMPANY THAT-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH I KNEW THAT WAS COMING. THANKYOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THANK YOU. THAT'S FOR YOU --
HOW CRAZY IS THIS?
A COMPANY THAT SELLS ALCOHOLIS THE MORAL TOUCHSTONE OF
THE NFL.
ALCOHOL.
MAYBE ONE OF THE ONLYSUBSTANCES THAT IS PROVEN
SCIENTIFICALLY TO INCREASETHE LIKELIHOOD OF DOMESTIC
ABUSE.
THAT COMPANY IS SAYING TOTHE NFL, YOU GUYS GOT A REAL
PROBLEM HERE.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S LIKE CAPTAIN MORGAN SHOWING
UP AT A FRAT PARTY GOINGARRGH MATIES, PLEASE, I'M
TRYING TO SLEEP.
KEEP IT DOWN.
FOR THE MORNING BRINGS ME ANORAL EXAM IN ART HISTORY.
ARRGH.
(LAUGHTER)ARRGH.
ARRGH.
BUT THE QUESTION POPS UP INMY HEAD, WHEN I HEAR ALL
THESE RUNNING AROUND AND THENFL CHANGING THEIR POSITION
AN REDOING IT AND THENCOMING BACK AND NOT KNOWING
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, ITREALLY MAKES ME WONDER.
WHAT DOES A STUPID PERSONMAKE OF ALL OF THIS?
>> I DO BELIEVE ADRIANPETERSON WENT TOO FAR.
I WILL SAY IT AGAIN.
BUT NY PROBLEM HERE IS DOPARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO
INSTILL THEIR VALUES INTHEIR CHILDREN.
YOU GUYS WANT TO TELLPARENTS WHAT THEY CAN AND
CANNOT DO.
FOR EXAMPLE, IS IT GOINGTO BECOME ILLEGAL IF A
PARENT TEACHES THEPOLITICALLY CORRECT VIEW
THAT BEING GAY IS NOT NORMAL?(AUDIENCE BOOS)
>> Jon: AH, SEANY. DON'T, DON'TWORRY SEANY.
SERIOUSLY, YOUR SPECIALBRAND OF SPITEFUL IGNORANCE WILL
ALWAYS BE LEGAL.
(LAUGHTER)AND PROFITABLE, SO SLEEP
WELL, FRIEND.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HANNITIY ARBITRARILYCONNECTED HOMOPHOBIA DOES
REMIND ME OF SOMETHING.
>> THE RAMS HAD TO KNOW THATDRAFTING MICHAEL SAM WOULD
CREATE A DISTRACTION.
>> WELL, THERE IS NO QUESTIONTHIS IS A DISTRACTION.
>> HERE'S SOME OF MICHAEL SAM'SPOTENTIAL TEAMMATES CALLING
THE WHOLE THING ADISTRACTION.
>> Jon: REMEMBER THOSE DAYS?
HOW SCARED THE NFL WAS BACKTHEN, THAT A GAY MAN WOULD
RUIN THEIR LEAGUE.
OOOH!
OH, WHAT THE NFL WOULDN'T DORIGHT NOW FOR THAT KIND OF
DISTRACTION.
(LAUGHTER)MY GUESS IS RIGHT NOW AT THE
NFL'S OFFICE, THEY AREWORKING NIGHT AND DAY, DAY
AND NIGHT ON A LEAGUE-WIDEBLOW A TEAMMATE PROMOTION.
(LAUGHTER)JUST TO CHANGE THE
CONVERSATION.
I TELL YOU, IF THE NFL'S PRGUYS ARE WORTH ANYTHING, AND
THEY'RE NOT, THEY WOULD MAKETHIS THE COVER OF NEXT
YEAR'S MADDEN.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
