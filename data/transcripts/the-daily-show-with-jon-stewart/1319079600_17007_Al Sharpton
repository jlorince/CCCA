MY GUEST TONIGHT, A CIVIL RIGHTS
ACTIVIST WHO NOW HOSTS HIS OWN
PROGRAM ON MSNBC CALLED POLITICS
NATION, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO
THE PROGRAM REVEREND AL
SHARPTON.
SIR!
[APPLAUSE]
FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS TO
YOU AND YOUR PERSONAL TRAINER.
>> THANK YOU, SIR.
>> Jon: YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Jon: HOW IS THE SHOW GOING?
HAS THAT BEEN AN EXCITING
OPPORTUNITY?
HAVE YOU ENJOYED YOURSELF?
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?
>> IT'S GOOD.
I LIKE IT.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I CAN BE ME, I
DEBATE PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT... I'M NOT TRYING TO
ACT OBJECTIVE.
I'M DOING WHAT I DO.
>> Jon: YOU'RE A NEWSMAN.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE
OBJECTIVE.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
I'M JON STEWART WITHOUT THE
CURSING.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T CURSE ON
MSNBC?
>> I DON'T CURSE.
>> Jon: AT ALL, EVER IN YOUR
LIFE?
>> I'M PROFOUND, NOT PROFEIGN.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: CAN I SAY THIS?
CHECK AND MATE.
I AM DONE.
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING
IT.
NOW WHAT DO YOU DO THEN IN A
SITUATION.
OKAY, OCCUPY WALL STREET COMES
UP.
IT'S A PROTEST VERY CLOSE TO
YOUR HEART IN TERMS OF ISSUES
AND IN TERMS OF CONSTITUENCY.
HOW DO YOU OPERATE IN THAT
ENVIRONMENT.
HOW DO YOU...
>> I SUPPORT IT.
I WENT DOWN AND DID MY RADIOSHOW
THERE.
I HAD PEOPLE ON THAT ARE FOR AND
AGAINST IT, THOSE THAT ARE...
MICHAEL MOORE WAS ON MY SHOW FOR
IT.
WE TALKED ABOUT WHY WE WERE FOR
IT.
RUSSELL SIMMONS WAS ON.
THEN THOSE AGAINST IT,
REPUBLICANS, I DEBATE THEM.
I DON'T DEPEND NOT TO HAVE AN
OPINION.
MY CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP HAD A JOBS
MARCH OVER THE WEEKEND, ABOUT
40,000, A MINATURE JON STEWART
MARCH.
WE DID THE BEST WE CAN.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
SHOULD TRY, IRONY.
[LAUGHTER]
PEOPLE LOVE TO COME OUT AND DO
NOTHING.
REALLY.
THEY GIVE YOU SO MUCH PLEEP
BLEEP FOR THAT.
PARDON ME.
[LAUGHTER]
>> FORGIVE YOU, MY SON.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
IS IT FRUSTRATING, 40,000 PEOPLE
IS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE TO
MOBILIZE FOR ANYTHING, YET THE
COVERAGE OF THAT CERTAINLY WAS
NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT.
WHAT IS IT, YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
AND THIS IS MY OWN PROBLEM AND
MY OWN INHIBITION, THE
THEATRICAL ASPECT OF ALL THAT
AND SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT
ARE ATTRACTED DOWN THERE I'M NOT
USUALLY DOWN WORK BUT I AM VERY
MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MESSAGE
THAT'S BEING ARTICULATED AND THE
FEELING THAT IS.
DO YOU NEED THOSE THEATRICAL
ELEMENTS TO GET THE ATTENTION?
IS IT A CATCH-22?
>> IT IS A CATCH-22.
THE PROBLEM, AND IT'S SOMETHING
YOU STRUGGLE WITH.
I HAVE ALL MY LIFE.
YOU CAN'T GET SO DEEP INTO NEAT
RICKS THAT YOU LOSE THE CAUSE OR
THAT YOU'RE SO ELITIST IN THE
CAUSE THAT YOU FORGET YOU'VE GOT
TO ATTRACT PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN NEW YORK,
SO MY ACTIVISM WAS MORE
THEATRICAL BECAUSE I'M COMPETING
WITH EVERY TOURIST ATTRACTION IN
THE WORLD.
IF YOU GREW UP IN THE SOUTH, YOU
HAVE A MARCH IT'S THE BIGGEST
THING IN TOWN.
>> Jon: YOU'RE GOING UP RUM
TUNNEL TIGGER.
>> I HAD TO STOP SUBWAYS AND
JUMP OVER BRIDGES TO MAKE PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S WRONG FOR
PEOPLE TO GET SHOT AT 50 TIMES.
JON IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT
IS WHAT THEY'VE DONE THERE IS SO
UNUSUAL THAT IT CAN'T BE
IGNORED.
>> CORRECT.
>> Jon: NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE
ATTENTION, I GUESS EVERYBODY'S
IMPATIENT FOR, SO, WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR
US.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: THERE'S THAT SENSE OF
THAT.
MAYBE WE'RE EXPECTING TOO MUCH.
>> I THINK THAT WE ARE.
BUT I THINK THEY'VE ALREADY
ACHIEVED SOMETHING GREAT.
THEY'VE CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
BECAUSE THREE MONTHS AGO THE
WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ON THE
REPUBLICAN DISCUSSION OF DEFICIT
REDUCTION.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JOBS.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT POVERTY.
IF NOTHING ELSE THEY GOT US ON
THE CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO
BE TALKING ABOUT.
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY
INTERESTING.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS
REALLY INTERESTING WHEN IT FIRST
HAPPENED PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT
WERE VERY QUICK TO JUMP OUT AND
SAY, MOBS HAVE TAKEN TO THE
STREETS AND THE SAME PEOPLE THAT
SUPPORTED THE TEA PARTY, WHICH
WAS JUST GOOD AMERICANS SPEAKING
THEIR MINDS.
BUT NOW EVEN THEY HAVE SOFTENED
TO THE EXTENT OF MITT ROMNEY IN
PARTICULAR.
I GET THE 99%.
I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING OUT FOR
THEM.
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU HOW QUICK
THAT TURNS?
>> IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT
NOW THEY UNDERSTAND THAT 1% OF
THE COUNTRY SHOULDN'T BE
CONTROLLING 40%.
99% IS... THEY KEPT SAYING THAT
UNTIL PEOPLE GOT IT.
NOW YOU GOT THE OTHER GUYS THERE
WITH 999, BUT HE SHOULD DROP ONE
NINE AND TALK ABOUT THE 99%.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: NOW WE... WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DO YOU HAVE TO GO TAPE YOUR
SHOW?
>> NEW YORK I'M ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: CAN YOU STICK AROUND
AND WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION.
THE HERMAN CAIN THING WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT WITH LARRY, THE
IDEA IN THIS COUNTRY A POSSIBLE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE, TWO AFRICAN
AMERICANS SQUARING OFF AGAINST
EACH OTHER HAS TO FEEL LIKE AN
ACHIEVEMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK
IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
>> IT IS AN ACHIEVEMENT, BUT I
THINK IT'S ALSO A GOOD POINT
WHERE PEOPLE THAT SAID THAT GUYS
LIKE ME WERE ONLY SUPPORTING
OBAMA BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK,
WELL, CAIN IS SOUTHERN BLACK, NO
INTERNATIONAL PARENTS AND I
WOULDN'T SUPPORT CAIN IF HE WAS
RUNNING AGAINST A WHITE GUY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I THINK THAT IS A GOOD
START.
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL THROW THIS UP ON THE WEB.
POLITICS NATION IS ON MSNPC
