( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY!WELCOME TO THE "THE DAILY SHOW."
THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, YOU HAVEDONE YOURSELF A SERVICE BY
TUNING IN TO TONIGHT'S PROGRAM.
IT IS GONNA BE OFF THE FLEEK.
TONIGHT'S GUEST, JUDITH MILLER,AUTHOR OF "THE STORY:
A REPORTER'S JOURNEY."IT'S LIKE THEY "EAT, PRAY LOVE"
OF GETTING AMERICA INTO THE IRAQWORLD.
IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY LONGINTERVIEW.
( LAUGHTER )BUT FIRST, THE SUPREME COURT,
THE KNOWLEDGEABLE NINE, ELGRANDE JUSTIVO.
ROBES, ROBES, ROBES.
YESTERDAY, AMERICA DROPPED DOWNON ONE KNEE AND PROPOSED ORAL
ARGUMENTS THAT COULD SETTLE THEQUESTION OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY
FOR GAY PEOPLE.
>> THE COURT WILL ANSWER TWOQUESTIONS-- CAN STATES REFUSE TO
ISSUE MARRIAGE LICENSES TOSAME-SEX COUPLES, AND CAN THEY
DECLINE TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEXMARRIAGES THAT WERE LEGALLY
GRANTED SOMEWHERE ELSE.
>> Jon: AND CAN THE COURT ANSWERTHOSE WHILE TRAVELING THE WORLD.
THAT'S RIGHT, THESUPREME COURT IS HEARING THOSE
CASES WHILE PARTICIPATING INTHIS YEAR'S "AMAZING RACE."
( LAUGHTER )SHE SEEMS-- SHE SEEMS PERFECTLY
COMFORTABLE ON A ZIP LINE.
( LAUGHTER )OF COURSE, AN ISSUE THIS
IMPORTANT WAS BOUND TO DRAW ACROWD, MAKING THEIR FINAL
ARGUMENTS.
THE PROGAY MARRIAGE CAMP WENTWITH HOW CAN A JUST GOD NOT
ALLOW TWO MEN THIS INTO BEARDCARE NOT BE TOGETHER?
WHILE THE ANTIGAY MARRIAGE CROWDWENT WITH WHY DON'T WE SUMMON
THE ANCIENT HEBREWS AND SEE WHATTHEY SAY?
BY THE WAY, YES, THAT IS ASHOFAR, AND YES, THE ANTIGAY MAN
IS BLOWING IT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
BUT, IT WOULDN'T -- IRONY. ALLRIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UP TO THOSE
OUTSIDE THE COURT.
>> THIS WILL, IN ALL LIKELIHOODCOME DOWN TO JUSTICE KENNEDY.
>> Jon:  KENNEDY, KENNEDY,KENNEDY!
THE ONLY JUSTICE ANYONEEVER CARES ABOUT IS KENNEDY.
HE'S THE MARCIA TO THESUPREME COURT'S EIGHT JANS.
BUT TUESDAY'S SESSION WAS MAINLYA FORUM FOR
GAY MARRIAGEOPPONENTS TO AIR THEIR BEST AND
FINAL ARGUMENTS WHICH WE LOOK ATIN TONIGHT'S SEGMENT, YOU GOT
NOTHING, SO-CALLED BECAUSEOPPONENTS OF GAY MARRIAGE GOT
NOTHING.
AND THEY TRIED EVERYTHING,STARTING WITH THE GOOD, OLD,
CLASSIC SLIPPERY SLOPE.
>> SUPPOSE WE RULE IN YOUR FAVORIN THIS CASE, AND AFTER THAT, A
GROUP CONSISTING OF TWO MEN ANDTWO WOMEN APPLY FOR A MARRIAGE
LICENSE.
WOULD THERE BE ANY GROUND FORDENYING THEM A LICENSE?
>> Jon:  WHY SHOULD GAYPEOPLE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR
ANYONE WHO IS EVER GOING TO WANTTO GET MARRIED AFTER THEY GET
THE RIGHT TO MARRY?
WHEN WOMEN FOUGHT FOR SUFFRAGENO WAS ONE LIKE WHAT IF ONE DAY
A DOG WANTS TO VOTE.
HOW ABOUT THAT, LADIES?
BECAUSE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THESTATE OF OUR UNION IS...
( BARK )
BY THE WAY, I LIKE THAT THESPEAKER IS A CAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS.
SO THAT WAS ONE DUMB ARGUMENTBUT HARDLY THE ONLY ONE.
>> IF YOU PREVAIL HERE, THEREWILL BE NO MORE DEBATE.
I MEAN, CLOSING THE DEBATE CANCLOSE MINDS, AND IT WILL HAVE A
CONSEQUENCE ON HOW THIS NEWINSTITUTION IS ACCEPTED.
PEOPLE FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLYABOUT SOMETHING IF THEY HAVE A
CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT THAN IFIT'S IMPOSED ON THEM BY-- BY THE
COURTS.
>> Jon:  SURE, NO, THAT MAKESSENSE.
IF YOU DON'T IMPOSE GAYMARRIAGE
FOLKS LIKE THIS WILL BE MOREOPEN MINDED.
( LAUGHTER )TO EVOLVING THEIR POSITION.
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
SEE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
BUT THE POINT WAS CLEAR.
THIS CASE THREATENS NOT JUSTMARRIAGE BUT OUR VERY DEMOCRACY.
>> WHEN YOU ENACT SOCIAL CHANGEOF THIS MAGNITUDE THROUGH THE
FEDERAL COURTS THAT'S NOT THEWAY THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
IS SUPPOSED TO WORK, AND THEREARE LONG-TERM HARMS TO OUR
COUNTRY AND TO THAT FUNDAMENTALLIBERTY INTEREST TO GOVERN
OURSELVES.
>> Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, LETME JUST SAY I LOVE YOUR LAWYER
COSTUME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
SECONDLY, IT'S BALLS FOR A YOUNGGUY TO WALK INTO THE SUPREME
COURT AND SAY I KNOW YOU THINKMARBURY VERSUS MADISON GIVES
YOU THE RIGHT TO DECIDE THECONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I
SAY WE'RE A DIRECT DEMOCRACY.
NOW, WHICH ONE OF YOU PRICKS ISGOING TO BUY ME BOOZE, I'M 19?
( LAUGHTER )BUT HERE'S THE THING.
WE HAVE BOTH A FUNDAMENTALLIBERTY TO GOVERN AND A COURT
EMPOWERED TO STOP US FROMABUSING THAT LIBERTY TO TAKE
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIBERTY.
THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS.
AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THECOURT'S DECISION, WELL THEN YOU
JUST HAVE TO SUCK IT UP,SOMETIMES FOR YEARS, WITH
HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
SO ENOUGH WITH THE DEMOCRACY!
ENOUGH!
CAN A BROTHER GET A LAME APPEALTO HISTORY ARGUMENT UP IN HERE?
>> EVERY DEFINITION THAT ILOOKED UP PRIOR TO ABOUT A DOZEN
YEARS AGO DEFINED MARRIAGEAS THE UNITY BETWEEN A MAN
AND A WOMAN AS HUSBAND AND WIFE.
OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU SUCCEED, THATCORE DEFINITION WILL NO LONGER
BE OPERABLE.
YOU'RE NOT SEEKING TO JOINTHE INSTITUTION.
YOU'RE SEEKING TO CHANGE WHATTHE INSTITUTION IS.
>> Jon:  THE INSTITUTION OFMARRIAGE HAS ALMOST NEVER NOT
BEEN CHANGING.
BEFORE THE LAST CENTURY,MARRIAGE WASN'T ONE MAN AND ONE
WOMAN.
IT WAS ONE MAN AND HIS NEW PIECEOF VAGINA PROPERTY.
( LAUGHTER )CHANGE CAN BE GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )BUT THE ANTIGAY CRAY-CRAY--
( APPLAUSE )PROBABLY PEAKED WITH THIS
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POINT OFMARRIAGE ITSELF.
>> IF YOU'RE CHANGING THEMEANING OF MARRIAGE FROM ONE
WHERE IT'S BASED ON THEBIOLOGICAL BOND TO ONE
WHERE IT'S BASED ON EMOTIONALCOMMITMENT, THEN ADULTS
COULD THINK, RIGHTLY, THAT THISRELATIONSHIP IS MORE ABOUT
ADULTS AND NOT ABOUT THE KIDS.
>> Jon:  WHOA!
( LAUGHTER )GAY MARRIAGE ISN'T ABOUT KIDS?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO PARKSLOPE?
OH, LOOK!
THE ELIZABETHS HAVE THE NEWDYSON UPPA BABY XL HOVER
CARRIAGE.
THAT WON'T BE HARD TO CLIMB OVERTO GET INTO BEANS AND SUCH.
( LAUGHTER )BUT, ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY THIS
OUT.
>> SUPPOSE THAT THERE'S A STATEWITH A VERY
PRO-CREATION-CENTERED VIEW OFMARRIAGE OF THE KIND THAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
SO WHEN PEOPLE COME IN AND ASKFOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE, THEY
JUST ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION, "DOYOU WANT CHILDREN?"
AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO, THESTATE SAYS, "NO MARRIAGE LICENSE
FOR YOU."
WOULD THAT BE CONSTITUTIONAL?
>> Jon:  OH SNAP, THAT WAS VERYRABBINICAL.
SOMEWHAT OBTUSE.
ANYONE WANT TO TAKE A MOREPRACTICAL SWING AT THIS?
>> SUPPOSE A 70-YEAR-OLD COUPLECOMES IN AND THEY WANT--
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  AND THIS
70-YEAR-OLD COUPLE, NO MATTERHOW MUCH THEY'RE ( BLEEP ), AND
THEY'RE ( BLEEP ) A LOT -- INTHE SIT-DOWN SHOWER, ON THAT--
ON THAT ELECTRIC STAIR CHAIR,BENT OVER THE MAHJONG TABLE--
THEY'RE NOT HAVING KIDS.
IS THEIRS NOT A CONSTITUTIONALLYWORTHY ( BLEEP )-FEST FILLED
LOVE AS WELL?
( LAUGHTER )BUT FAIR QUESTION.
WHAT IF-- WHAT IF A COUPLE OF70-YEAR-OLDS WANT TO GET
MARRIED, COUNSELOR?
IF MARRIAGE IS FOR HAVINGKIDS WHY SHOULD THAT BE ALLOWED?
AND WHEN ANSWERING TRY TO STEPAS HARD AND DEEP INTO A PILE OF
DOG ( BLEEP ) AS POSSIBLE.
>> WELL, A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN,OBVIOUSLY, IS STILL CAPABLE OF
HAVING CHILDREN AND YOU LIKE TOKEEP THAT WITHIN THE MARRIAGE.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW, I THINKHE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF
ANSWERING HAM ANA-HAM ANA-HAMANA.
SPINNING THE BOW TIE, THROWING ASMOKE BOMB AND GETTING THE
( BLEEP ) OUT OF ROOM.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS-- IFORAL ARGUMENTS HAVE ANY IMPACT
ON THE FINAL RESULTS, JUNE ISGOING TO BE A NICE TIME FOR A
GAY WEDDING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
