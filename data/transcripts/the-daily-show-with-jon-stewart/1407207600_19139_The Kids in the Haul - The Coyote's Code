>> Jon: I THINK PERHAPSTONIGHT I'LL HAVE SOME HOT
POCKETS.
WELCOME BACK.
SO CONGRESS CANNOT SOLVE THEBORDER CRISIS.
OR ANY OTHER PROBLEM.
[LAUGHTER]BUT WHY ARE WE IN THIS MESS TO
BEGIN WITH?
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONANNOUNCED IN 2012 IT WOULD ALLOW
SOME CHILDREN TO REMAIN IN THEU.S. WITHOUT FEAR OF
DEPORTATION.
THAT PROGRAM APPLIED ONLY TOCHILDREN WHO ARRIVED AT THE U.S.
BEFORE 2007.
BUT SMUGGLERS IN CENTRAL AMERICAARE CONVINCING FAMILIES THE
REPRIEVE STILL STANDS.
>> FAMILIES ARE BEING LIED TOAND MANIPULATED BY THE COYOTES.
>> Jon: COYOTES.
WHAT IF WE JUST GET THEM TO LOOKDOWN.
[GUNFIRE][APPLAUSE]
NO, HONESTLY, THAT WAS REALLYLONG WALK FOR A WYLE E. COYOTE
JOKE. TOOK YOU ALL AROUND THEBLOCK AND WENT... SO, THERE'S
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS WECAN ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL
ISSUES CAUSING THIS PROBLEM --ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THEIR
HOME CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES,TRAINING ASSISTANCE TO CENTRAL
AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT,REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION COURTS
TO PROCESS MINORS MOREEFFICIENTLY.
>> YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THESEAMBIGUITIES IN OUR LAW THAT ARE
CREATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES THATARE ALLOWING THESE TRAFFICKING
GROUPS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO PAYTHEM $8,000 OR $10,000 TO BRING
THEM HERE.
>> Jon: OR YOU CAN MAKESEMANTIC CHANGES.
THAT'S THE OTHER WAY WE COULDGO, JUST CHANGE THE WORDING.
SIX OH ONE. FOR MORE ON THEHOUSE BOARDER BILL, WE TURN TO
SENIOR IMMIGRATION CORRESPONDENTJORDAN KLEPPER IN MEXICO.
JORDAN, THANK YOU FOR JOININGUS.
[APPLAUSE]JORDAN, IF OBAMA'S ACTION GIVES
COYOTES LEEWAY TO LIE, WHATMAKES YOU THINK THAT THE HOUSE
BILL IS GOING TO STOP THEM?
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> FIRST OF ALL, JON, DOWN HERETHE TERM COYOTE IS CONSIDERED
OFFENSIVE.
THEY PREFER PEDIATRICIMMIGRATION CONSULTANT.
>> Jon: WHERE, WHERE ARE YOU,JORDAN?
>> SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CHIHUAHUAAND AUSTIN.
I'M TRAVELING WITH THECONSULTANTS AS THEY EMIGRATE
SOME PEDIATRICS.
AND THEY'RE WORRIED THAT IF THEAMBIGUITY IS TAKEN OUT OF THE
LAW THIS COULD BETHEIR LAST RUN.
>> LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, OBAMA'S2012 ORDER, WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY
ENABLING THESE IMMIGRATIONCONSULTANTS COYOTES TO LIE, IT
CLEARLY APPLIED ONLY TOCHILDREN WHO ENTERED
BEFORE 2007 AND WERE PRESENTPHYSICALLY STILL IN 2012.
SO THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY.
WHERE IS THE AMBIGUITY?
>> PRESENT PHYSICALLY 2012 OFWHAT, 2012 OF WHAT, JON?
WHAT ARE THESE TERMS.
THEY COULD BE ANYTHING.
>> HOW COULD IT, HOW COULD IT BECLEARER, JORDAN?
>> OKAY, IT COULD BE CLEARER.
YOU COULD BOLD IT, YOU COULDUNDERLINE IT, BIGGER FONT.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO STOPTHE BORDER CRISIS, THERE ARE
TOOLS AVAILABLE.
DO DIAGRAMS OF HOW TO FOLLOWTHE LAW LIKE IKEA.
YOU KNOW, CLARIFY IT.
YOU NEED TO CLARIFY THE LAW ANDTHE COYOTES WILL FOLLOW IT.
>> Jon: WHY?
WHY WOULD CHANGING THE LAW STOPTHESE PEOPLE FROM LYING ABOUT
THE LAW?
THEY'RE ALREADY LYING ABOUT ITNOW.
>> WHOA!
THAT'S A SERIOUS CHARGE.
ALL RIGHT.
BE CAREFUL.
YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP WITH ASLANDER SUIT ON YOUR HANDS.
>> Jon: I SEEM, I SEEM TO HAVEANGERED YOU.
>> YEAH, YEAH.>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
>> THAT IS SERIOUS, JON.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET SUED.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
TOO LATE.
BUT THEY ARE, THEY ARE LYING.
>> YES, BUT WITH A SOFT LIE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> IS IT REALLY LYING WHENYOU'RE LYING TO A CHILD OR A
FAMILY THAT DOESN'T KNOW ANYBETTER?
>> Jon: YES. THAT IS STILL, THATIS STILL LYING,
EVEN WHENYOU DO IT TO CHILDREN.
>> NO, NO, NO, PLEASE.
EVERYONE LIES TO KIDS TO GIVETHEM HOPE.
YOU KNOW, SANTA IS REAL.
YOU CAN GROW UP TO BE PRESIDENT.
MOMMY AND DADDY LOVE EACH OTHER.[LAUGHTER].
KIDS NEED HOPE AND COYOTES AREHERE TO PROVIDE IT.
FOR A NOMINAL FEE OF $8,000$10,000.
>> Jon: SO THE COYOTES WILLFILL THE SPACE OF AMBIGUITY IN
WITH LIES, EVEN IF NO AMBIGUITYEXISTS, BUT THE ONE LINE THEY
WILL NOT CROSS IS THE ABJECTLINE.
>> NOW YOU ARE GETTING IT.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
>> IT'S A LITTLE THING CALLEDTHE COYOTE'S CODE.
SURE. YOU KNOW, THEY'LL SEWCHILDREN INTO THE UPHOLSTERY
OF CARS, TAKE DESPERATEFAMILIES' ENTIRE SAVINGS, KILL
THEM OFF IF THEY DON'T PAY,YOU KNOW, BUT YOU WILL NOT GET
SOMEONE WHOSE PROFESSIONAL NAMEIS SYNONYMOUS WITH AN
AMORAL SCAVAGING BEASTTO LIE ABOUT THE REPEAL
OF AN EXECUTIVE ACTION. YOUKNOW. THEY'RE NOT HYENAS.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, JORDAN.
GOOD LUCK ON THE TRAIN.
JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I DIDN'T REALIZE.
