( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT OF COURSE, THAT WASN'T THE
ONLY I.R.S.-RELATED HEARING ON
THE HILL.
>> APPLES CHIEF TIM COOK FACING
SOME OUTRAGED SENATORS.
>> Jon:  FINALLY, SOME
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR APPLE MAPS.
I MEAN, COME ON!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MAYBE SOME PRISON TIME-- MAYBE
SOME PRISON TIME WILL MAKE THOSE
GUYS THINK TWICE ABOUT DIRECTING
ME TO A CHIPOTLE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE HUDSON RIVER.
( LAUGHTER )
ACTUALLY, APPLE C.E.O. TIM COOK
WAS CALLED IN TO FACE THE WRATH
OF SENATORS WONDERING HOW APPLE
HAD AVOIDED PAYING TAXES ON $44
BILLION IN INCOME IN THE LAST
FOUR YEARS, IN PART BY STASHING
OVER $100 BILLION IN NEARLY
TAX-FREE OFFSHORE SUBSIDIARIES.
>> I'M VERY PROUD OF APPLE.
>> WE LOVE THE iPHONE AND THE
iPADS.
I GOT ONE RIGHT HERE.
>> YOU'VE McED TO CHANGE THE
WORLD, WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE
LEGEND.
>> I HARASSED MY HUSBAND UNTIL
HE CONVERTED TO A MAC BOOK.
>> YOUR PRODUCTS ARE GREAT.
>> MY GRANDDAUGHTER EVEN KNOWS
HOW TO USE IT.
>> I LOVE APPLE.
I LOVE APPLE.
>> Jon:  I-- I WANT TO
I-( BLEEP ) YOU.
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
WHAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF A GENIUS
BAR?
( LAUGHTER )
APPARENTLY, THERE IS NOTHING
APPLE CAN DO TO GET AS MAD AT
THEM.
THEY'RE DODGING TAXES WE CAN
FIND OUT THEY'RE USING KITTEN
HEARTS TO POWER iPHONES.
AND WE'D BE LIKE, "WELL, IF IT
DOUBLES BATTERY LIFE, I'LL TAKE
TWO."
IN FACT, THE HEARING WAS LESS
"WE'RE ANGRY AT YOU FOR BREAKING
CURFEW" AND MORE LIKE, "WHAT
TIME DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD GET
HOME?"
>> IF YOU WERE IN OUR POSITION,
HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS
THAT WE CHANGE THE TAX CODE?
>> WHAT KEEPS ANOTHER COUNTRY IN
ONE OF THESE EMERGING MARKETS
FROM UNDERCUTTING US?
>> WHAT RATE DO YOU THINK WE
HAVE TO BE AT IF YOU WANT TO BE
COMPETITIVE?
>> DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE
ABLE TO DEDUCT THE INTEREST.
>> Jon:  HOW ABOUT?
HOW ABOUT WE PAY YOU FOR THE
INCONVENIENCE OF KEEPING YOUR
MONEY OVERSEAS.
THE UPKEEP MUST BE UNBELIEVABLE,
LIKE HAVING A PONY.
( LAUGHTER )
NOT THAT APPLE C.E.O. TIM COOK
WASN'T HAPPY TO OFFER
SUGGESTIONS.
>> APPLE HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IN
THE SIMPLE, NOT THE COMPLEX.
IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT WE
RECOMMEND A DRAMATIC
SIMPLIFICATION OF THE CORPORATE
TAX CODE.
>> Jon:  I GIVE YOU THE TAX
CODE NANO.
( LAUGHTER )
SO, WHAT WOULD THE NANOENTAIL?
>> ELIMINATE ALL CORPORATE TAX
EXPENDITURES, LOWER CORPORATE
INCOME TAX RATES.
AND IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE TAX
ON FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT ALLOWS
THE FREE FLOW OF CAPITAL BACK TO
THE UNITED STATES.
>> Jon:  WOW.
ALL THAT SIMPLIFICATION IN
CLOSING OF LOOPHOLES WOULD BE
GREAT.
UNTIL, OF COURSE, OIL COMPANIES
LOBBY TO MAKE SURE THE R & D
EXPLORATION TAX CREDITS STAY IN
PLACE.
AND AGRAMAKES SURE EQUIPMENT
DEPRECIATION STAYS IN THERE
BECAUSE THAT'S THE RUB OF THIS
ENTIRE EXERCISE.
CORPORATIONS ARE THE ONLY REASON
THE TAX CODE IS SO COMPLICATED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THOSE OFFSHORE LOOPHOLES DIDN'T
GET CARVED OUT BY POOR PEOPLE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
OUR TAX CODE IS PURPOSEFULLY--
OUR TAX CODE IS PURPOSEFULLY
COMPLEX SO THAT CORPORATIONS
WITH RESOURCES ARE THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN FIND THE BURIED GOODIES
THEIR OWN LOBBYISTS HAVE HIDDEN
IN THE LABYRINTH.
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING-- BUT THIS IS APPLE.
THEY BELIEVE INICISM PLIFT.
( LAUGHTER )
THEY WOULDN'T USE COMPLEXITY,
JUST WHEN IT SUITS THEIR OWN
BUSINESS NEEDS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT, RIGHT?
DO YOU AGREE?
JUST ( BLEEP ) HIT AGREE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
