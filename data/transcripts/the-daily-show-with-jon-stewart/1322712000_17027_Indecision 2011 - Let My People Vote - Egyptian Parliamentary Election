GOOD LOOKING SANDWICH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DESPITE THE ITEM YULT IN EGYPT
MONDAY'S ELECTION WAS PEACEFUL
AND INSPIRING.
STARTING TODAY EGYPT IS NOW A
FUNCTIONING REPRESENTATIVE DEM
CINCH THE PARLIAMENT ELECTED
THROUGH THIS PROCESS WILL BE ONE
WITHOUT POWER.
EVEN AFTER THE POLITICIANS TAKE
THEIR SEATS THE COUNTRY WILL
STILL BE RUN BY AN UNELECTED
MILITARY COUNCIL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: OKAY THEN FOR THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE WINNER IS
NOT SYMBOL TANK BUT TANK TANK.
FOR MORE WE TERN TO THE MIDDLE
EAST POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT
AASIF MANDVI.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU, JON.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, IT APPEARS
THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS OVER
HOW MEANINGFUL THE EGYPTIAN
ELECTIONS REALLY ARE.
>> SURE, JON, THERE ARE ISSUES
TO BE SORTED OUT BUT THIS JUST
THE BEGINNING.
A DEMOCRACY IS A DELICATE
FLOWER.
WITH THIS ELECTION, EGYPT HAS
PLANTED THE SEED AND IF ITS
PEOPLE DEND TO IT WITH ENOUGH
DEVOTION AND PATIENCE THIS
FORMER DESERT OF DICTATORSHIP
WILL BLOSSOM TO A BEAUTIFUL
GARDEN OF FREEDOM.
>> Jon: OKAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UM --
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL --
[ LAUGHTER ]
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YOU DON'T SEEM ALL THAT
EXCITED ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: NO, NO,, NO I'M
EXCITED FOR THEM.
>> YOU DON'T SOUND EXCITED.
>> Jon: I'M EXCITED.
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT I'M EXCITED.
>> I DON'T GET IT AMERICANS ARE
ALL FOR SPREADING DEMOCRACY IN
THE MIDDLE EAST WHEN YOU ARE
DOING THE SPREADING.
WHEN EGYPTIANS ACHIEVE IT ON
THEIR OWN, YOU HATE IT IF YOU
CAN'T CONTROL IT.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WE DON'T WANT TO CONTROL IT.
IT'S NOT TRUE.
WE WANT TO INFLUENCE.
WE WOULD LIKE TO INFLUENCE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> CONTROL.
>> Jon: YES, CONTROL.
WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL.
>> AWR AFRAID OF -- YOU ARE AFRAID
OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
>> Jon: NO, NO -- WE HAVE SOME
CONCERNS.
>> HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE THAT
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WILL GAIN
CONTROL OVER THE GOVERNMENT AND
USE IT AS A BASE OF RADICALISM.
>> Jon: DID YOU HEAR THAT?
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
>> YOU CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
LOTS COUNTRIES HAVE POLICIES NOT
IN OUR INTEREST.
FRANCE WANTS TO BUY OIL FROM
IRAQ.
CHINA WANTS TO SELL US TOYS MADE
OF LEAD.
RUSSIA WANTS TO EXTINGUISH THE
SUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY SHOULD EGYPT BE DIFFERENT?
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
JUST THE NAME MUSLIM
BROTHERHOOD.
NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS IN A
BROTHERHOOD.
IT JUST DOESN'T.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF THOSE TRAVELING PANTS WERE IN
A BROTHERHOOD, THE MOVIE HAVE
NOT BEEN NEARLY AS WHIMSICAL.
>> EVEN THE YMCA, YOUNG MEN'S
CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION SOUNDS
HOSTILE.
>> Jon: THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
IT'S FUN TO STAY AT THE YM --
>> THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW IT'S JUST
DEMOCRACY, MIDDLE EAST -- AASIF,
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT IS THE MOST INSULTING WAY I
COULD PUT THIS, UM -- FOX?
>> IS THERE ANY SUCH THING AS
MODERATE ISLAM?
>> WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
BECAUSE WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN
THEM IN POWER.
>> SO, JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU GUYS
THINK THAT THIS FIRST ROUND
ELECTION TO ELECT A LOWER HOUSE
OF PARLIAMENT WILL DETERMINE
ONCE IN FOR ALL IF THERE'S SUCH
A THING AS MODERATE ISLAM.
>> Jon: YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> AND THIS ELECTION WILL
DETERMINE WHETHER I AS A MUSLIM
AM ABLE TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY OR
IF I HAVE INHERENTLY DRAWN TO
SLAUGHTER THE JEWS AROUND ME
LIKE FLIES.
RIGHT?
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR NOT
THINKING THAT EGYPTIAN LEADERS
ARE DETERMINED BY WHO CAN ANSWER
THE SPHINX'S RIDDLE.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
>> WHAT WALKS OUR FOUR LEGS IN
THE MORNING, THREE AS A BABY
AND --
>> OH, MY GOD YOU ANSWERED IT.
>> Jon: IT'S A MAN.
>> YOU ARE NOW THE NEW PRESIDENT
OF EGYPT.
SUN OF A -- NO, NO, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?
THIS IS NOT A CAUSE FOR
CELEBRATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
WORK FOR THIS MAN.
>> Jon: AASIF MANDVI,
