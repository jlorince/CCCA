>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT-- IT'S A GOODONE-- JEREMY RENNER.
JEREMY RENNER IS GOING TO BEHERE FROM THE NEW FILM
"KILL THE MESSENGER."
MAN, IS IT A GOOD STORY.
BUT FIRST, REMEMBER THE BIGFINANCIAL CRISIS, 2008?
( LAUGHTER )WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER IT YOU
WEREN'T THERE, MAN.
( LAUGHTER )THAT WAS WOODSTOCK.
ANYWAY, IT TANKED THE ECONOMY.
WELL, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOUGOT GOOD AND ANGRY ABOUT IT?
WANT TO?
( LAUGHTER )ALL RIGHT.
YOU ASKED FOR IT.
REMEMBER HOW WE GIFT WRAPPED$184 BILLION TO INSURANCE GIANT
A.I.G. TO PURCHASE THATCOMPANY'S TERRIBLE MORTGAGE BETS
SO THAT THEIR INCOMPETENCEWOULDN'T BECOME A GLOBAL
EXTINCTION EVENT?
( LAUGHTER ).
WE JUST GOT THE THANK YOU NOTE.
>> FORMER AMERICAN INTERNATIONALGROUP CHIEF HANK GREENBERG IS
SUING THE ARCHITECTS OF THEGOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE
FINANCIAL PANIC OF 2008?
>> HE CLAIMS THE BAILOUTVIOLATED SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.
>> Jon:  REALLY!
( LAUGHTER )SO JUST TO SET THE TABLE FOR YOU
HERE, THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER OFA.I.G., WASN'T RUNNING IT AT
THE TIME WAS JUST THE LARGESTSHAREHOLDER, A COMPANY THAT WAS
HOURS AWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY ISSUING THE ENTITY THAT THROUGH
SHEER FORCE OF $184 BILLIONSAVED IT-- OR-- LET ME PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY.
YEAH, YOU GAVE ME C.P.R., BUTWOULD IT KILL YOU TO TAKE A
BREATH MINT?
( LAUGHTER )WHAT IF ANY IS THE LEGAL BASIS
FOR HANK GREENBERG'S CLAIM.
>> HANK GREENBERG AND HISINVESTMENT FIRM STAR
INTERNATIONAL CHARGING THEGOVERNMENT VIOLATED A.I.G.'S
FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS BYCHARGING IT HIGH INTEREST
RATES ON LOANS AND BY NOTCOMPENSATING THEM PROPERLY FOR
TAKING WHAT BECAME A 92% STAKEIN THE COMPANY.
>> YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE PROPERTYWITHOUT PAYING FOR IT.
>> Jon:  YOU CAN'T!
( LAUGHTER )I THINK $184 BILLION IS PAYING
FOR IT!
LOOK, ALL RIGHT, SO HE BELIEVES$184 BILLION WAS NOT WORTH 92%
OF THE COMPANY.
IT WAS UNFAIRLY LOW.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE ADICK-- HE MAY BE RIGHT. LOOK,
LET'S CHECK THE-- LET'S CHECKTHE BLUE BOOK VALUE FOR A TOXIC
ASSET-FILLED INSURANCE COMPANYFROM 2008 ON THE DAY OF THE
BAILOUT.
AND IF WE PUT ONE OVER ON YOU,MR. GREENBERG, IF WE TREATED YOU
UNFAIRLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'SOUR BAD AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO
APOLOGIZE AND WRITE YOU ACHECK FOR HOWEVER MANY
BILLIONS MORE YOU HAVE BEENUNFAIRLY DEPRIVED OF.
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THE MATH.
WE GAVE $184.6 BILLION INEXCHANGE FOR 92% OF A.I.G.
SO THAT MEANS WE ARE VALUING THECOMPANY AROUND $200 BILLION.
SO NOW I'M ALL -- YOUKNOW WHAT I MEAN? BECAUSE NOW
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF HOW MUCHMORE THAN $200 BILLION WAS THIS
COMPANY WORTH WHEN THE BAILOUTBEGAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH
WE'RE GOING TO OWE THIS GUY.
SO, HERE WE GO.
WHAT WAS IT WORTH?
$15.4 BILLION.
ALL RIGHT.
HMM.
HMM.
( LAUGHTER )SO WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE PAID YOU
92% OF $15.4 BILLION, WE PAIDYOU $184 BILLION OR MORE THAN
1,000% OF YOUR COMPANY'S MARKETVALUE.
SO I CAN SEE WHERE YOUR ANGERCOMES FROM.
( LAUGHTER )EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN WHY YOU'RE
IN COURT?
>> TODAY A LAWYER FOR A.I.G.'SFORMER CHIEF SAID THE TERMS OF
THE BAILOUT WERE EXTORTION.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  AS A GENERAL RULE,
YOUR BETTER EXTORTIONISTS, YOURBETTER KIDNAPPERS EXTRACT MONEY
FROM THEIR VICTIMS.
( LAUGHTER )RATHER THAN CONTRIBUTE.
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER HEAR THIS--HEY, LISTEN, IF YOU EVER WANT TO
SEE YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE DOGGYAGAIN, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE
$184 BILLION AND ONCE YOU GETTHE MONEY, WE WILL ALSO GIVE YOU
YOUR DOG BACK.
NO COPS!
( LAUGHTER )THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO TELL THEM
NOT TO HAVE THE COPS COME.
IF ANYTHING, THE FINANCIALSYSTEM EXTORTED THE TAXPAYERS BY
SCREWING UP SO ROYALLY THE WORLDWOULD BE ON THE BRINK OF
FINANCIAL APOCALYPSE WITHOUT THEBAILOUT.
WE WERE THE ONES WITHOUT ACHOICE.
BUT YOU PREFER TO PAINTYOURSELF AS A VALIANT CRUSADER
AGAINST GOVERNMENT TYRANNY.
>> WHAT'S THE CAPITALIST SYSTEMLIKE?
WHAT DO WE BELIEVE IN?
WE BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT HAS THERIGHT TO TAKE WHAT THEY WANT AND
YOU JUST SHUT UP AND EAT YOURRICE?
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  WELL, I DON'T EAT RICE!
UNLESS IT'S A TRUFFLE RISOTTO.
I LIKE A NICE RISOTTO!
LOOK, HANK GREENBERG, JUSTBECAUSE YOU'RE A GRUMPY OLD MAN,
LET'S NOT PRETEND THIS IS UP.
WHERE YOU'RE SOME--( LAUGHTER )
WHERE YOU'RE SOME SAD OLDWIDOWER BEING FORCED INTO A
NURSING HOME SO THEY CAN TAKEAWAY YOUR BELOVED BALLOON-FILLED
HOUSE AND TURN IT INTO ASKYSCRAPER.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT CARTOONCHARACTER YOU ARE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )LISTEN, YOU GOT ANY OTHER
COMPLAINTS OR CAN I JUST DISMISSTHIS CASE RIGHT NOW?
>> HE IS ARGUING THAT A.I.G. GOTMUCH HARSHER TERMS, ABOUT 14%
INTEREST RATE ON THEIR LOAN.
THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROMBANKS LIKE CITIGROUP OR MORGAN
STANLEY.
>> THEY WERE GETTING MOREGENEROUS TERMS.
THAT IN AND OF ITSELF PROVES THEGOVERNMENT WENT TOO FAR WITH
A.I.G.
AT LEAST THAT'S THE ARGUMENTHANK GREENBERG AND HIS LAWYERS
ARE MAKING.
>> Jon:  SO YOUR ARGUMENT INCOURT, YOUR LEGAL ARGUMENT IS
WAAAAH!
( LAUGHTER )IT'S NOT FAIR!
FOLLOWING THE PRECEDENT SET BYTHE FAMOUS SUPREME COURT CASE I
ONLY GOT ONE COOKIE V.
MY SISTER GOT TWO COOKIES.
COME ON!
( LAUGHTER )SACK UP!
LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, THEYSHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN TWO
COOKIIES IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUTTHAT DOESN'T MEAN YOUR ONE
COOKIE IS NOTHING.
YOUR LOAN TERMS WERE WORSE THANTHE BANKS' BECAUSE YOU WERE
INSOLVENT.
YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW THAT WORKS.
YOU'RE AN INSURANCE COMPANY.
( LAUGHTER )PUTTING THE SCREWS TO PEOPLE IN
THEIR LOWEST MOMENTS IS WHAT YOUDO.
SO THE ESSENCE OF GREENBERG'SARGUMENT APPEARS TO BE THE BANKS
GOT SPECIAL TREATMENT THATA.I.G. DID NOT GET, TO WHICH I
SAY WELCOME TO THE ( BLEEP )WORLD, BUDDY.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEENMAD ABOUT FOREVER!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )REALLY?
YOU'RE ANGRY THAT THEY WOULDN'TLEND TO YOU AT LESS THAN 14%.
YEAH.
WE HATE IT, TOO, ONLY WE CALL ITHAVING A CREDIT CARD.
AND WE DON'T SUE OVER THOSERATES BECAUSE WE CAN'T.
( LAUGHTER )AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DID STILL GET SPECIALTREATMENT. $184 BILLION FOR 92%
OF A ( BLEEP ) COMPANY ISSPECIAL TREATMENT.
IT JUST WASN'T AS SPECIAL AS YOUWANTED IT TO BE.
THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE SUING THEGOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE THEY GAVE
YOU A SEAT IN FIRST CLASS BUTNOT THE ELITE PLATINUM NORMAL
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUTTHIS PART OF THE PLANE, BUT IT'S
AWESOME, BECAUSE WE HAVE AJACUZZI UP HERE SECTION.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW-- HOW THE RESTOF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN
TREATED IN A.I.G.'S SHOES.
IT'S IN A LITTLE ONE-MAN SHOWI'VE BEEN WORKING ON ENTITLED
"A NORMAL PERSONASKS FOR A LOAN."
( LAUGHTER )I TAKE YOU NOW TO ANYTOWN,
U.S.A.
WHERE THE LOCAL LOAN OFFICER--( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WINK.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS GOING TOWORK.
IN REHEARSAL DIDN'T WORK.
I COME BACK OUT HERE, IT WORKS.EDISON!
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )OH, HELLO, MR. GREENBERG.
OH PRESCRIPTION.
OKAY.
( LAUGHTER )YOU'VE ASKED US FOR $184.6
BILLION FOR 90% OF YOUR COMPANYWHICH IS ONLY WORTH $15 BILLION.
HOLD ON.
( LAUGHTER )AH!
AH!
GO ( BLEEP ) YOURSELF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
