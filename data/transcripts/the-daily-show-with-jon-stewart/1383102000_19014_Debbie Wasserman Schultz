MY GUESTTONIGHT CONGRESSWOMAN
FROM FLORIDA ALSO THE CHAIR OFTHE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
COMMITTEE.
HER BOOK IS CALLED "FOR THENEXT GENERATION, A WAKE UP TO
SOLVING OUR NATION'S PROBLEMS."
PLEASE WELCOME DEBBIE WASSERMANSCHULTZ.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> YOU, TOO.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
>> HANGING IN THERE.
>> Jon: HOW IS THINGS GOINGBUSY?
>> A LITTLE INTENSE.
A COUPLE THINGS GOING ON.
>> Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED"FOR THE NEXT GENERATION."
WHICH CLEARLY SAYS TO ME YOUHAVE GIVEN UP ON OUR GENERATION.
OUR GENERATION HAS SODISAPPOINTED YOU YOU THOUGHT
WELL FORGET THEM YOU GUYS TAKECARE OF IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> GOTTA AT LEAST TRY TO FOCUS
ON THE FUTURE.
IF WE CAN'T SALVAGE THIS ONE.
>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU ARE A PROPONENT OFGOVERNMENT'S ROLE OBVIOUSLY IN
HELPING TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'SLIVES, SAFETY NET.
I BELIEVE I WOULD AGREE WITH YOUON THAT PREMISE.
HAS THIS BEEN A GOOD RUN FORTHAT BELIEF SYSTEM?
[LAUGHTER]OR A SLIGHTLY COLD
WATER/GATORADE.
>> IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BUMPY FORTHOSE OF US THAT THINK THAT
GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALL OF THEPROBLEM AND CAN BE PART OF THE
SOLUTION.
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY CAN BE APOSITIVE FORCE IN PEOPLES' LIVES
BUT WE CAN'T RELY ON GOVERNMENTFOR EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE.
>> Jon: IN YOUR MIND BECAUSEBOY DID THE REPUBLICANS.
THEY HANDED THE DEMOCRATS AGOLDEN OPPORTUNITY BY BEING
CRAZY PEOPLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> WELL --
>> Jon: AND THEN SO YOU COULDHAVE ESTABLISHED THIS.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT IN THE MECHANISM IS GOINGWRONG AND IS THIS TOO LARGE AN
ISSUE FOR GOVERNMENT TO BEINVOLVED IN?
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU WOULD THINK BECAUSE ICHAIRED THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
COMMITTEE THAT I WOULD AGREEWITH YOU THAT THE REPUBLICANS
HANDED US THE GOLDENOPPORTUNITY.
POLITCALLY I THINK THEY DIDTHEMSELVES SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.
BUT THE REALITY IS THEYDRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED OUR
ECONOMY, THEY BROKE GOVERNMENTEVEN WORSE THAN PEOPLE THINK IT
ALREADY IS AND WE'VE GOT TO GETIT BACK ON TRACK.
THE MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY POLITICS HAS TO STOP.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITYI SPEAK OF.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: THEIR BEHAVIOR OVERTHE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS
BEEN SOMEWHAT NIHILISTICTHAT BEING SAID HOW DO THE
DEMOCRATS SEIZE THAT MANTLE OFCOMPETENCE AND THOSE SORTS OF
THINGS?
>> I HOPE WHEN PEOPLE READ MYBOOK THAT THEY TREAT IT AS A
ROAD MAP FOR HOW THEY CAN GETENGAGED. WE NEED REAL PEOPLE
TO SOUND AN ALARMBELL. TOO MANY POLITICIANS
ALLOWED THEMSELVESTO BE STRANGLED BY THE TEA
PARTY.
THE TAIL IS WAGGING THE DOG.
>> Jon:I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THEY WERE ROBOTS.
GOWHEN YOU SAID WE NEED REALS.
PEOPLE>> THEY HAVE ROBOTIC LIKE
TENDENCIES. I UNDERSTANDIT CAN'T ALWAYS BE MY WAY.
YOU HAVE TO REACH ACROSS THEAISLE AND WORK TOGETHER.
WE NEED REAL PEOPLE WE NEED MOMSTO GET INVOLVED
WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION OR HEALTHCARE OR IMMIGRATION REFORM OR
THE ECONOMY.
AND CHOOSE THE ISSUE THAT THEYCARE ABOUT THE MOST.
AND TRY TO INFLUENCE AND GET
INVOLVED IN THAT ISSUE SO THEYCAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
BECAUSE IF WE LET THESE THINGSGO OUR KIDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUFFER.
>> Jon: OBSTRUCTIONISM ASIDEAND I KNOW IT MAKES IT HARDER
AND CERTAINLY FOR THEM THEY HAVENO STAKE IN SEEING IT SUCCEED.
KNOWING THAT THAT IS PART OF THEEQUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT
WRONG ON THE -- I DON'T WANT TOSAY THE DEMOCRAT SIDE BUT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE WHERE THISGREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ROLL OUT
THIS INCREDIBLE INITIATIVEFOR HEALTH CARE GOES SO SOUTH
WHEN IT COULD HAVE REALLY, NOTPUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF
OBSTRUCTIONISM BUT DEMONSTRATEDTHIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO BEHELPFUL TO THE CITIZENS.
>> ANY TIME YOU HAVE A MAJORCHANGE IN ANY SYSTEM LIKE THE
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WE KNOWTHERE ARE GOING TO BE KINKS AND
BUMPS.
AND THERE HAVE BEEN WITH THEROLLOUT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHATWE SHOULD BE -- WE ALL HAVE ATO
AGREE ON ONE BASIC PREMISE THATEVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO
ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITYHEALTH CARE AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T
SEEM TO GET REPUBLICANS TO AGREEON THAT BASIC PREMISE THEY ARE
HELL BENT ON THROWING EVERYOBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF TRYING
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS.
YES, THERE'S KINKS BUT IN MYEXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT, WHEN
YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLEIMPLEMENTING A LAW, YOU
WORK TOGETHER TO IRON OUT THOSEPROBLEMS.
YOU DON'T TRY TO REPEAL IT ORDELAY IT 46 TIMES.
YOU DON'T HOLD THE ECONOMYHOSTAGE.
>> Jon: I'M NOT IN GOVERNMENTBUT I HEARD 47 IS THE CHARM.
IT'S AN OLD SAYING I HAVE HEARD.
[LAUGHTER]>> YOU HAVE TED CRUZ, MARCO
RUBIO, MIKE LEE AND RAND PAULWHO ESSENTIALLY THE MOUNT
RUSHMORE OF THE TEA PARTY DOINGEVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PREVENT
PEOPLE LIKE ME.
I'M A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR.
ON JANUARY 1 PEOPLE LIKE ME WILLHAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NEVER AGAIN
BE DENIED COVERAGE FORPREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
>> Jon: THERE'S WONDERFULTHINGS IN THIS HEALTH CARE.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOG ON.
>> PEACE OF MIND.
>> Jon: YES.
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION IS ONTHE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
