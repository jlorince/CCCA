>> THANK YOU. FELLOW DIRECTORS.
LET'S JUST TALK SHOP.
I LOVE IT.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL FAMILIARWITH THESE PICTURES, BUT I DON'T
THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD JUST HOWBANANAS THE STORY IS.
>> OH YEAH. I MEAN, I GREW UPWITH THESE IMAGES.
>> Jon: YES.
>> AND I WAS, EVEN AS A CHILD IWAS FASCINATED OF WHY GROWN
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE APICTURE OF A CRYING CHILD IN
THEIR LIVING ROOM -->> Jon: WITH GIANT EYES!
>> YEAH! YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERYLIKE, TO ME, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
A HORROR MOVIE IMAGE,THESE WEIRD EYES LOOKING.
AND EVERYBODY HAD IT.
>> Jon: THAT TYPE OF THINGAPPEALS TO YOU SOMEWHAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SORT OF INFLUENCED ME A BIT.
BUT IT WAS SUCH A FASCINATINGPHENOMENON IN THE SENSE THAT
SOME PEOPLE LOVED THEM AND SOMEPEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS THE
DOWNFALL OF CIVILIZATION, YOUKNOW. AND, YOU KNOW,
I, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, THOUGHTIT WAS WALTER KEANE WHO WAS THE
ARTIST.>> Jon: YES.
>> AND LATER LEARNED THE REALSTORY ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS TAKING CREDIT FORHIS WIFE'S WORK. SO, YOU KNOW,
LIKE ALL RELATIONSHIPS I'VEHAD WITH MYSELF, AMAZING
DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPSCREATING THESE STRANGE MUTANT
CHILDREN, JUST SEEMEDINTERESTING TO ME.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: WELL BROKEN DOWN!
AND THAT'S WHAT -- YOU KNOW,THIS IS -- WHAT'S SO INTERESTING
TO ME ABOUT THIS STORY IS ITINCAPSULATES ALMOST EVERYTHING
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOWABOUT THE '50s AND '60s CULTURE,
SORT OF THAT, YOU KNOW, THE BEATGENERATION STRIKING OUT IN
BOHEMIAN WAYS BUT ALSO WOMENFINALLY TAKING CONTROL OF THEIR
OWN WORK. HE WAS ANARTIST AS WELL, YES?
WALTER?
>> WELL, NO. THAT'S THE THING.YOU KNOW, THEY WENT TO TRIAL
AND, AND THE TRIAL --
>> Jon: THAT'S MY FAVORITE, BYTHE WAY. THE TRIAL --
>> WELL, AND PEOPLE THINK IT WASOVER THE TOP, BUT WE ACTUALLY
TONED IT DOWN. I MEAN, HE DIDCROSS-EXAMINE HIMSELF.
HE DID, YOU KNOW, RUN FROM --
>> Jon: REALLY!
>> YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOUWOULDN'T BELIEVE IT ON,
YOU KNOW, A BAD SITCOM, BUT, YOUKNOW, WE HAD TO, THIS IS THE
REALISTIC VERSION OF IT IS WHENYOU SEE IT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S WAS WHAT WASSO AMAZING ABOUT THE STORY,
HE WAS SUCH, YOU KNOW, A MIXTUREOF THINGS, WALTER.
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS ATTHE SORT OF FOREFRONT OF,
YOU KNOW, PRINTING OF ART.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, FOR THE MASSES. ANDTHAT'S WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE
PICASSOS AND MATISSES HANGINGON THEIR WALL.
THEY HAD KEANES.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO IT WAS A WEIRD CULTURALPHENOMENON AS I WAS GROWING UP.
>> Jon: AND THEY SAY, YOU KNOW,HE WAS NOT WITHOUT TALENT,
BUT HIS TALENT IS AS AP.T. BARNUM, AS A BARKER.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: AND THEY SAY THESE OTHERPOP ARTISTS, WARHOL AND THOSE,
WOULD SAY, WEBORROWED FROM WALTER.
>> YEAH NO, AND I MEAN, AND ALLTHE STUFF, NOW YOU WALK INTO A
MUSEUM, YOU GO BUY A POSTER. IMEAN, YOU KNOW, ON A POSITIVE
LEVEL, IT DID CONNECT, YOU KNOW,SORT OF THE ART WORLD TO PEOPLE
BEING ABLE TO AFFORD IT, AND YOUKNOW, AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS, YOU KNOW, SCHMOOZINGCELEBRITIES, YOU KNOW,
KIM NOVAK, JIM CRAWFORD,YOU KNOW.
SO, YOU KNOW, ALLTHE PRACTICES THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE COULD EASILY MOVE AT A MOVIESTUDIO AND BE VERY SUCCESSFUL.
>> Jon: YOU WHAT WOULD BE CRAZY?IMAGINE A GUY LIKE TRYING TO DO
THAT, LIKE PAINT THESE PICTURESBUT HE HAD LIKE SCISSORS FOR
HANDS. LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.I'M JUST PITCHING THIS OUT!
I'M PITCHING THIS OUT, TIM!LISTEN TO ME!
>> YEAH, WELL THEY DIDN'T WANTTO MAKE THAT MOVIE.
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THISMOVIE, SO THEY REALLY WOULDN'T
WANT TO MAKE THAT MOVIE.
>> Jon: PUTTING THEMTOGETHER. NOW, MARGARET,
SO MARGARET KEANE WHO IS THEWOMAN WHO IS ACTUALLY THE ARTIST
INVOLVED IN THIS, STILL ALIVE.
>> YEAH, YEAH. AND SHE PAINTSEVERY DAY. AND I MEAN,
SHE IS THE MOST QUIET, PRIVATE,SHY, SHE'S THE MOST SORT OF
QUIET FEMINIST YOU'VE EVER METIN THE SENSE THAT SHE REALLY
HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, SHEWASN'T REALLY A VICTIM
BECAUSE SHE WAS COMPLICIT INTHIS SORT OF THING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND THEN WHEN SHE WENT TO
TRIAL, YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'TDOING IT TO BE VINDICTIVE.
SHE JUST WANTED THETRUTH TO COME OUT.
AND YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST LIKETHE QUIETEST, SORT OF -- YOU
KNOW, THE MOST QUIET FEMINISTYOU'VE EVER MET IN A WAY,
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING VERY AMAZINGABOUT HER AND STRONG.
>> Jon: HOW HARD WAS IT TOGAIN HER TRUST IN TERMS OF
PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT?
BECAUSE IN THIS TYPE OFSITUATION, YOU HAVE THIS VERY
PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL.
THIS IS A STORY THAT, YOU KNOW,IS, IT'S GOT ITS HIGHS AND LOWS
AND SHE CAN AT TIMES BE NERVOUSABOUT PUTTING IT BACK OUT THERE.
DID YOU HAVE TO CONVINCINGHER?
>> WELL YEAH, I MEAN, BETWEENTHE WRITERS AND MYSELF,
YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT ITHINK SHE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD.
AND WHEN SHE MET AMY ADAMS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SHE REALIZED THAT AMYWANTED TO DO HER JUSTICE
AND TELL IT FROM THATPOINT OF VIEW.
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE -- YOU KNOW,THE AMAZING THING, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T THERE WHENSHE SAW THE FILM.
YOU KNOW, SHE STARTED CRYINGBECAUSE SHE GOT TO SPEND AN
EXTRA TWO HOURS WITH WALTERAGAIN, WHICH SORT OF FREAKED HER
OUT.
>> Jon: AND SHE WAS -- BECAUSETHEY OBVIOUSLY SPLIT UP AFTER HE
DEFAMED HER AND TRIED TO TAKECREDIT FOR ALL HER WORK.
>> AND BEAT HER AND WHATEVERELSE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND ALLTHE TERRIBLE THINGS.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT SHE ACTUALLY, SHEWAS STILL, I MEAN, SHE WAS A BIT
CHARMED BY HIM STILL.
>> YEAH, WELL, I MEAN, HE WAS,YOU KNOW, THAT STRANGE MIXTURE
OF P.T. BARNUM AND AN AMAZINGSORT OF MARKETEER AND AGAIN,
AHEAD OF HIS TIME ON THAT LEVEL.>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> HE WAS JUST ALSO A PSYCHO.
>> Jon: WITH AN AWESOME, JOB,MAN.
BUT IT DOES, THERE WASEVERYTHING, AS I WAS WATCHING
I WAS THINKING LIKE, OH I CANSEE WHY TIM BURTON LIKES THIS
MOVIE. I CAN SEE WHY, YOU KNOW,IT JUST APPEALS.
>> WELL, THOSE IMAGES, YOU KNOW.THEY JUST UNFORTUNATELY,
OR FORTUNATELY, STAYWITH YOU FOREVER.
>> Jon: YES.>> THOSE, YOU KNOW,
I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITHTHOSE EYES STARING AT YOU.
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SLEEP ATNIGHT.
I HAVE INSOMNIA.
>> Jon: WELL, I REALLY HOPETHAT THAT NEVER CHANGES BECAUSE
I LOVE THE WORK THATCOMES OUT OF IT.
