>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
UNBELIEVABLE PROGRAM FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
BILL GATES.
BILL GATES, FORMER CEO OF
MICROSOFT CORPORATION IS HERE.
YOU
KNOW BILL AS
THE GUY WHO
GETS A DOLLAR EVERY TIME YOU
HEAR THIS.
HE JUST MADE A DOLLAR.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE
TURMOIL IN EGYPT OR MESS O-
SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT-O POTAMIA.
MANY AMERICAN JOURNALISTS
GOING OLD SCHOOL.
ROLLING UP THE SLEEVES
JENNINGS' STYLE.
SOME FILED LIVE REPORTS
AMONGST THE PEOPLE.
OTHERS OFFERED COMMENTARY FROM
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A CRITICAL
DISTANCE SAY, MAYBE FROM THE
MEETING OF BILLIONAIRES IN
DAVOS SWITZERLAND.
THE CONTRAST WAS SOMETIMES
STARK.
>> WHAT THE UNITED STATES
SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON ARE ON
THREE THINGS.
HOPING WHATEVER TRANSITION
THERE IS PEACEFUL.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, FRIEDMAN.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A PASS
ON BEING AT DAVOS.
EVEN BILLIONAIRES NEED THE
OCCASIONAL HOW THE WORLD WORKS
METAPHORS.
BUT I CANNOT IN GOOD
CONSCIENCE LET THAT JACKET GO
BY WITHOUT COMMENTING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, WOULD?
IS THAT A LEATHER TUXEDO?
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LEATHER
JACKET WENT OUT AND BOUGHT
ITSELF A LEATHER JACKET.
OR PERHAPS YOU BOUGHT THAT 20
YEARS AGO THINKING THAT'S HOW
WE'LL ALL DRESS IN THE FUTURE.
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS,
BUT YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQ
WAR IS NOW YOUR SECOND BIGGEST
LAPSE IN JUDGMENT.
BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT
THE PUNDITS THINK OR ARE
WEARING, HOW IS THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT REACTING TO EVENTS
ON THE GROUND?
HERE IS HILLARY CLINTON PRE-I
POST WEEKEND.
>> THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT IS
STABLE AND IS LOOKING FOR WAYS
TO RESPOND TO THE LEGITIMATE
NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THE
EGYPTIAN PEOPLE.
WE WANT TO SEE AN ORDERLY
TRANSITION TO A DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT, TO ECONOMIC
REFORMS EXACTLY WHAT THE
PROTESTERS ARE SEEKING.
>> DID I SAY STABLE AND
RESPONSIVE?
I MEANT LEAVING.
HOLY (BEEP) MAKING THE U.S.
LOOK LIKE A METS' FAN AT A
PHILLY GAME.
GO, METS!
I MEAN PHILLIES.
OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH THE
UNITED STATES HAS EXPRESSED
SUPPORT FOR THE PROTESTS WE
MAY HAVE SOME CREDIBILITY
ISSUES WITH THE EGYPT STREET.
>> THESE PROTESTORS SAID THE
WEAPONS USED BY THE EGYPTIAN
FORCES WERE MADE IN THE USA.
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THIS PHOTO
OF A TEAR GAS CANNISTER USED
BY THE EGYPTIAN FORCES.
THE FAMILIAR "MADE IN THE USA"
MARKINGS ON THE CAN.
>> Jon: WE WRITE THAT ON OUR
TEAR GAS CANNISTERS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
DO WE WANT PEOPLE TO HATE US?
HEY YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE WRITE "MADE IN
CHINA" ON OUR TEAR GAS?
AND THEN WHEN WE DROP FOOD OR
INVENT, I DON'T KNOW, A PILLOW
CANNON, THAT WE CAN BRAND WITH
OUR LOGO.
SO, PRESIDENT MUBARAK HAS LOST
THE UNITED STATES, HE HAS LOST
THE SUPPORT OF HIS PEOPLE.
HE HAS LOST THE SUPPORT OF HIS
PEOPLE'S PETS.
MR. PICKLES, HOW COULD YOU
TURN ON HOSNI MUBARAK?
WITH ALL EYES NOW ON HIM,
HOSNI MUBARAK SPOKE TO THE
EGYPTIAN NATION.
WOULD HE HEAR THEIR
GRIEVANCES?
>> I ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO
RESIGN TODAY.
I WILL TELL THE NEW GOVERNMENT,
COME TOMORROW, IN VERY
SPECIFIC GOAL TO WORK WITH THE
CURRENT SITUATION.
>> Jon: MESSAGE RECEIVED.
HOSNI MUBARAK HAS HEARD YOU
AND SAID, I'VE FIRED THOSE JAG-
OFFS HEY, I NEVER LIKED THEM
TO BEGIN WITH.
I WANTED TO GET RID OF THEM
FOR YEARS.
I ONLY KEPT THEM BECAUSE I
THOUGHT YOU LIKED HIM.
