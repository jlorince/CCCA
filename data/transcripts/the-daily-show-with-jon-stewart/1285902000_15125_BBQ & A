THIS WEEK BARACK OBAMA CONTINUED
HIS BACKYARD TOUR SPEAKING WITH
ORDINARY AMERICANS WHILE TRYING
DESPERATELY NOT TO BE UPSTAGED
BY A BEHIVE OF CHILI PEPPERS.
>> EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I NEED
TO GET OF -- OUT THERE WAS AND
LISTEN TO FOLK AND GET
SUGGESTIONS AND ADVICE.

BUT, HEY, OBAMA CAN GO CASUAL.
HE CAN TALK POLITICS OVER
BURGERS AND LAW IS.
THERE'S NOTHING -- AND SLAW.
THERE'S NOTHING UNPRESIDENTIAL
ABOUT SPENDING TIME IN THE
BACKYARD.
>> WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.
WE TRIED TO CLEAN UP EVERYTHING.
YOU NEVER KNOW THERE COULD BE A
FRESH ONE OUT THERE.
WATCH YOUR STEPS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
THE WEIRDEST THING ABOUT THAT
COMMENT.
THE GENTLEMAN IN THE PLAID SHIRT
DOESN'T HAVE ANY DOGS.
[LAUGHTER]
CIRCUMSTANCE YOU ARE THE LEADER
OF FREE WORLD.
YOU HAVE TAKEN THE PRESIDENCY
FROM AIR FORCE ONE TO BACKYARD
NUMBER TWO.
LET'S RESPECT THE DIGNITY OF THE
OFFICE.
NOW THEY'VE GOT HIM SPEAKING SPEAKING TO
KIDS IN DETENTION.

HOSTS.
THEY FIGURED -- A LOT OF THEM
HAVE FIGURED OUT THE MORE
CONTROVERSIAL I CAN BE THAT WILL
GET ME ATTENTION.

I'LL SELL IT AND I -- RIGHT?
AND THERE ARE FOLKS ON THE LEFT
WHO DO THE SAME THING, TRYING TO
BE PURPOSELY PROVOCATIVE SAYING
THE MEANEST, NASTIEST THINGS YOU
CAN SAY ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE.

[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Joe: OH, MY GOD.
TOUGH HOME ROOM.
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT AT
HIS MOST RIVETING -- FOR GOD
SAKES THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES IS STANDING THREE
FEET IN FRONT OF YOUR EARTH
SCIENCE CLASS.
UNLESS YOU THINK HE IS THERE AS
PART AFTER THIS NEW BORED
STRAIGHT PROGRAM YOU THINK YOU
WANT TO BE PRESIDENT?
YOU THINK IT'S STATE DINNERS AND
STEVIE WONDER CONSERTZ.
I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU?
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
YOU THINK I WANT TO BE IN
PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS STEPPING ON
DOG (bleep).
YOU THINK I DIDN'T SEE THAT KID

I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING I HAVE TO
BE NICE.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN THE PRESIDENT TURNED TO A
TOPIC OF SUCH MONUMENTAL
IMPORTANCE IT COULDN'T HELP BUT
CAPTURE THE IMAGINATIONS OF
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.

AMOUNT OF SENSE.

REACTION FROM THE KIDS.
