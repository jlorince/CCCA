WE COME.
EACH PARTY SAYS THE OTHER IS
LEADING US TO ARMAGEDDON.
IS EITHER OF THEM BEING SLIGHTLY
HYPERBOLIC?
FOR MORE WE GO TO THE FUTURE
WITH SAMANTHA BEE IV AND AASIF
MANDVI, JR.,, JR.,, JR., IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
HELLO, GUYS.
>> HELLO, JON.
>> GLEEP GLOOP GLOP.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOSH, IS
ENGLISH NO LONGER IN USE?
>> OF COURSE IT IS.
I'M JUST [BLEEPED] WITH YOU.
>> Jon: YOU'RE IN THE FUTURE
WHERE REPUBLICANS DID NOT RAISE
THE DEBT CEILING.
ARE WE IN TROUBLE IN
>> NOT REALLY.
REPUBLICANS GOT EVERYTHING THEY
WANTED.
AMERICA DECLARED BANKRUPTCY AND
IN RECEIVERSHIP RESTRUCTURED OUR
GOVERNMENT AND WE GOT THIS
CAPITALIST YOU OPEN THEA.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: IS THIS AIR
BREATHABLE?
>> IT STINGS A LITTLE, BUT THE
FREE MARKET WILL CORRECT IT.
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY, FOR SURE.
>> Jon: ASSIF, TELL ME ABOUT
THE FUTURE THAT YOU'RE LIVING
IN.
>> WELL, HERE THE DEMOCRATS
SUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE DEBT
CEILING AND INCREASED TAXES
WITHOUT CUSHING SOCIAL PROGRAMS.

GOT TO TELL YOU, SEEING THAT, A
LITTLE BIT OF A RELIEF.
IT REALLY DOES LOOK GREAT.
>> OH, WHAT THIS BACKGROUND?
>> Jon: YEAH.

SIMU-SCREEN MADE AVAILABLE
THROUGH THE ENHANCEMENT ACT OF
2033.
USUALLY IT DOESN'T WORK THAT
WELL.
THAT'S IT.
THERE IT IS.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: ASSIF, THAT'S EXACTLY
THE SAME ENVIRONMENT THAT'S IN
SAM'S FUTURE.
>> NO, NO, SAM IS FACING
CANCEROUS POLLUTANTS.
THIS IS A RADIATION CLOUD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WELL, WE RAISED THE DEBT
CEILING, BORROWED MORE THAN WE
COULD REPAY, AND WHEN CHINA
DEMANDED THEIR MONEY BACK, THERE
WAS A REPO SITUATION.
LONG STORY SHORT, WE NUKED THEM,
THEY NUKED US AND HAVE SINCE
BEEN AT WAR WITH THEIR NEW ARMY
OF RADIOACTIVE PANDAS.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO
LIVE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL,
SOCIALIST PARADISE.

NOR DEMOCRATS WERE IN ANY WAY
EXAGGERATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF
EACH OTHER'S POLICIES.
>> NO, NO, IN FACT,
UNDERSELLING, OR AS OUR GLORIOUS
CHAIRMAN BOBO WOULD SAY [MAKING
CHIMP NOISES]
ALL HAIL BOBO.
>> OH, PLEASE, SAVAGES.
THANK GOD THE LAISSEZ FAIRE
POLICIES OF OUR DEAR PRESIDENT
FIELD MARSHAL BOBO HAVE
PROTECTED US AS HE SO ELOQUENTLY
STATED IN HIS STATE OF THE
[MAKING CHIMP NOISES]
>> Jon: I THINK THAT LAST
PARTED WAS A FECES THROW FOR
EMPHASIS.
>> VERY EXPRESSIVE.
>> Jon: NO MATTER WHICH PARTY
GAINS TUPPER HAND IN 2011, IT
LEADS TO A DYSTOPIA IN AMERICA
GOVERNED BY APES.
>> BOTH: YES.
>> Jon: NO THIRD OPTION MIGHT
