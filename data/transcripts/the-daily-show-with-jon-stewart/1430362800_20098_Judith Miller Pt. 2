>> Jon:  AND HE'S THE GUYYOU RELY ON AND TRUST TO TELL
YOU IF THIS IS WRONG OR RIGHT.
>> ONE OF, NO, ONE OF SEVERALEXPERTS BECAUSE OPINION IS
DIVIDED AND YOU HAVE TO ASKA LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
>> Jon:  HE'S THE EXCERPTTHAT YOU WRITE IN YOUR BOOK THAT
YOU TRUST, THAT YOU'REDESPERATELY TRYING TO REACH.
>> YES, I WAS DESPERATELY TRYINGTO REACH HIM.

WE HAD MANY, MANY QUALIFIERS-->> Jon:  WE WERE PAYING HIM
TO SPREAD THAT INFORMATION.

>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  SO WE'RE PAYING--OR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS
PAYING THESE GUYS TO SPREADINFORMATION ABOUT SADDAM
HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS OF MASSDESTRUCTION.
AT THE SAME TIME THIS ISHAPPENING, DICK CHENEY IS GOING
ON TELEVISION IN AUGUST ANDSAYING THERE'S A NUCLEAR
PROGRAM, THERE'S ALL THESETHINGS.
AND IN SEPTEMBER THEY, BEGINWHAT'S CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE
IRAQ GROUP, YES?
AND THAT'S A GROUP OF KARL ROVE,KAREN HUGHES, AND ALL THESE
PEOPLE-- GERSEN-- AND THEIR JOBIS TO SELL THE WAR TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEYWEREN'T BUYING IT.
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THEYWEREN'T BUYING IT.
>> CAN I JUST TALK ABOUTALUMINUM TUBES?
>> Jon: YES, PLEASE.
>> BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHINGWE KNEW THAT WAS NEW THAT WAS
REALLY SPINNING UP THEINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
>> Jon:  SO, YOU REPORT THATTHEY'VE GOT THESE TUBES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: THIS ALBRIGHT NEVERCALLS YOU BACK.
>> NO.
>> Jon:  SO YOU RUN WITH IT.
NOW THERE'S A PHRASE IN YOURSTORY ON THE 8th THERE WHERE AN
UNNAMED SOURCE SAYS, "WEDON'T WANT THE SMOKING
GUN TO BE A MUSHROOM CLOUD."
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
THAT PHRASE-- DO YOU KNOW WHERETHAT PHRASE COMES FROM?
>> NO, BECAUSE I ONLY KNOW THATCONDI RICE REPEATED IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IT COMES FROM THEWHITE HOUSE IRAQ GROUP--
>> WHICH SHE'S A MEMBER OF.
>> Jon:  FIVE DAYS BEFOREYOU WRITE THE ARTICLE.
>> BUT IT'S A VERY POWERFULLINE.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND IT EXPLAINS THEIRTHINKING.
>> Jon: BUT IT COMES FROMGERSEN. IT DOESN'T --
IT'S A POLITICAL LINE DIRECTLYTIED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU SAID THE INFORMATION DOESN'TCOME FROM THEM.
>> JON, WERE WE NOT SUPPOSED TOREPORT WHAT IT WAS THAT HAD THE
COMMUNITY, THE INTELLIGENCECOMMUNITY SO NERVOUS ABOUT
SADDAM.
>> Jon: NO, YOU SHOULD HAVEREPORTED IT THOUGH --
>> WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THATFROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
>> Jon: IN THE CONTEXT THAT THISADMINISTRATION WAS VERY CLEARLY
PUSHING A NARRATIVE, AND BYLOSING SIGHT OF THAT CONTEXT,
BY NOT REPORTING-->> I THINK WE DID.
THE STORY SAID-->> Jon:  I WHOLEHEARTEDLY
DISAGREE WITH YOU.
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT MAKESJOURNALISM. I MEAN, LOOK --
>> Jon:  IT'S ACTUALLY NOTWHAT MAKES JOURNALISM.
>> IT IS.
>> Jon: SO LET'S CONTINUE WITHTHIS.
>> LET'S CONTINUE WITH THIS.
>> Jon: SO YOU DON'T RUN WITH-- YOU RUN WITH THE STORY WHEN
DAVID ALBRIGHT DOESN'TCALL YOU BACK.
HE CALLS YOU BACK ON THATTUESDAY AND SAYS THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS.
>> RIGHT.
>> THESE TUBES ARE NOT USEDFOR THAT.
THEY'RE USED FOR ROCKETS.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> Jon:  IN YOUR ARTICLE ONTHE 18th WHICH RUNS ON PAGE
13, NOT ON PAGE 1. WHERE, AND ISSTILL, AND IS STILL --
>> I DON'T, I DON'T PUT -->> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: BUT IT IS STILLENTITLED, "WHITE HOUSE LISTS
IRAQ'S STEPS TO BUILDBANNED WEAPONS."
>> RIGHT.>> Jon: IT'S STILL TITLED
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS LIKE IRAQ'SA THREAT.
>> BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE HAD
JUST LEASED ANOTHER PAPER SAYINGWE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.  ALBRIGHT CALLSAND YOU SAYS THIS IS WRONG.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: OKAY. YOU DON'T PUT THATIN THAT ARTICLE.
WHY?
>> I DID PUT IT IN.>> Jon: NO, YOU --
>> I SAID THAT THE COMMUNITY WASDIVIDED.
I DIDN'T QUOTE DAVID ALBRIGHT.
>> Jon:  HE SAID YOU COULDQUOTE HIM BY NAME.
>> YES, HE DID.
>> Jon:  WHY DIDN'T YOU?
>> I THINK THE STORY GOT CUT FORSPACE.
BUT I DIDN'T-- YOU KNOW, LOOK,LET'S --
>> Jon: SO IN YOUR ORIGINALARTICLE YOU WROTE IN THERE
DAVID ALBRIGHT ANDTHEY CUT IT BY TAKE OUT--
>> I DON'T, YOU KNOW, I REALLYDON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE ON
THAT STORY --
>> Jon: WHAT YOU SAY IN THE BOOKIS --
>> WAIT A MINUTE --
>> Jon: WHAT YOU SAY IN THE BOOKIS--
>> I COULDN'T REMEMBER.
>> Jon:  YOU COULDN'TCORROBORATE IT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE HE SAIDTHESE ARE THE LABS THAT HAVE THE
PEOPLE.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OFTHESE TUBES.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND I CALLED-- I MUST HAVECALLED 10 OR 15 PEOPLE.
AND NOBODY WOULD TALK ABOUT IT.
I WENT OUT TO AN ANALYST'SHOUSE.
I STOOD IN FRONT OF HIS DOOR.
I-- YOU KNOW, I TRACKED-- IWAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK FROM
WORK.
HE SAID, "I CAN'T TALK TO YOUABOUT THIS."
I CALLED PEOPLE I KNEW HAD GIVENME VERY GOOD INFORMATION IN THE
PAST.
THEY SAID, "NO, NO, THAT'S AMINORITY VIEW."
AND SO I WENT TO DAVID AND ISAID, "LOOK, DAVID, FIND ME ONE
PERSON FROM A LAB.
YOU'RE NOT IN THE MEETINGS.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTHESE MEETINGS.
TELL ME ONE PERSON WHO CANCORROBORATE THIS, AND WE'LL PUT
THIS-- YOU KNOW, WE'LL MAKE THESTORY AS LONG AS WE POSSIBLY
CAN."
AND HE EITHER COULDN'T ORWOULDN'T.
THERE WAS A PROBLEM.
BECAUSE DAVID, EVEN THOUGH HEDISAGREED ABOUT THE TUBES,
BELIEVED THAT SADDAM HAD ANUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.
>> Jon:  I UNDERSTAND THAT,BUT THE STANDARD OF PROOF IN ALL
THIS SEEMS MUCH HIGHER ON THESIDE OF THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE,
AND THEY'RE NOT A THREAT, ANDMUCH LOWER ON THE SIDE OF YOU'RE
BEING FED-->> BUT THAT'S WHAT THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY BELIEVED.
>> Jon:  THAT'S WHAT THEY WEREFEEDING YOU. THEY CREATED --
>> NO, NO, THAT'S WHAT THEYBELIEVED, JON.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'REOBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO SEE EYE TO EYE ON IT.
I MEAN, I APPRECIATE YOU COMINGON THE PROGRAM.
THESE DISCUSSION ALWAYSMAKE ME INCREDIBLY SAD BECAUSE I
FEEL LIKE THEY-- THEY POINT TOINSTITUTIONAL FAILURE AT THE
HIGHEST LEVELS, AND NO ONE WILLTAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.
>> I THINK THEY POINT TO -->> Jon: AND THEY PASS THE BUCK
TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL, OTHER THANTHEMSELVES, AND IT'S SAD.
>> I THINK THEY POINT TOINTELLIGENCE FAILURES THAT I
STILL WORRY ABOUT EVERY DAY,BECAUSE WE'RE STILL RELYING ON
THE SAME INTELLIGENCECOMMUNITIES TO GIVE US
INFORMATION ABOUT IRAN, NORTHKOREA, PAKISTAN, AND THE OTHER
COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE TO DEALWITH.
>> Jon:  WELL, HOPEFULLY,GIVEN THE SAME EFFORT, WE'LL GET
TO INVADE ALL THEM SOON.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WE WON'T.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  "THE STORY" IS ONTHE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
