>> Jon: POINT TAKEN.
ANY WAY, THE SPENDING PAUL RYAN WAS THE OLD PAUL RYAN.
HE APPEARED TO HAVE AN EPIPHANY ABOUT SPENDING SOME TIME AROUND WHEN THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER THE
BUDGET AND IS NOW AN IDEA MAN.
>> WE HAVE HEARD A GROWING NUMBER OF COMPARISONS BETWEEN MR. RYAN AND FORMER PRESIDENT
RONALD REAGAN.
>> PAUL RYAN HAS BEEN THE ONE WHO'S LED THE CHARGE ON ENTITLEMENT REFORM.
>> PROBABLY THE SMARTEST PERSON I KNOW IN POLITICS.
>> HE'S ACTUALLY DONE THE INTELLECTUAL WORK, THE RIGOROUS WORK OF PUTTING DETAILED
PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE.
>> PAUL RYAN HAS BECOME AN INTELLECTUAL LIEDER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> Jon: IN FACT, I, MITT ROMNEY, AMEERLY A WELL-CHISELED
DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR OUR NATION'S REAL FUTURE LEADER.
I AM THE FLAVORLESS GEL CAP SURROUNDING THE BITTER FISCAL MEDICINE WE SO DESPERATELY NEED
TO SURVIVE A FLAVORLESS HUNK.
THEY'RE... OH.
(LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, SO WHEN DO WE START IMPLEMENTING RYAN'S GENIUS PLANS
LIKE DEFUNDING MEDICAID AND CONVERTING IT INTO BLOCK GRANTS AND HE HAD ONE PLAN FOR
PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY A WHILE BACK AND TRANSFORMING MEDICARE INTO JUST A VOUCHER
SYSTEM WHILE REDUCING THE TAX BURDEN ON OUR NATION'S OVERBURDENED SUPERRICH ALLOWING
THEM TO SOAR LIKE VAMPIRES THAT CAN'T ACTUALLY FLY BUT ARE SO STRONG THAT WHEN THEY JUMP IT
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE (BLEEP)ING FLYING!
SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT...
(LAUGHTER).
>> NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
>> Jon: FINALLY, WITH THE SELECTION OF PAUL RYAN THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE PUTTING
THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTHS ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY.
RIGHT, EVERY REPUBLICAN WHO'S EVER BEEN ASKED ABOUT RYAN'S
SOMEWHAT AUSTERE PLANS OVER THE LAST 72 HOURS?
>> I THINK THAT MITT ROMNEY APPRECIATES AND ADMIRES THE WORK AND THE IDEAS THAT PAUL RYAN HAS DONE.
BUT MITT ROMNEY HAS HIS OWN PLAN.
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS OWN PLAN AND DOES HAVE HIS OWN PLAN.
>> IT SOUNDS AWFULLY LIKE THE PAUL RYAN MEDICARE PLAN!
>> BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BUT DON'T GO THERE,
SOLEDAD.
WHERE DID YOU GET THE BALLS,
LIBERAL MEDIA, TO SUGGEST MITT ROMNEY'S MEDICARE PLAN IS IN ANY
WAY SIMILAR TO RYAN'S PLAN FOR MEDICARE?
>> MY PLAN FOR MEDICARE IS VERY SIMILAR TO HIS PLAN FOR MEDICARE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT GUY IS TOTALLY IN THE TANK FOR OBAMA!
(APPLAUSE) WAIT.
I'M SURE GOVERNOR ROMNEY CAN CLEAR UP THIS CONFUSION.
>> I'M SURE THERE ARE PLACES THAT MY BUDGET IS DIFFERENT THAN
HIS, BUT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
THE ITEMS THAT WE AGREE ON I THINK OUTWEIGH ANY DIFFERENCES THERE MAY BE.
WE HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH PIECE BY PIECE.
>> Jon: BASICALLY WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THE BUDGET PLANS FOR THE TWO OF THEM ARE VERY
DIFFERENT BUT REALLY MOSTLY THE SAME ALTHOUGH WE REALLY HAVEN'T COMPARED THEM YET.
(LAUGHTER) THIS CAMPAIGN IS MORE CONFUSING ABOUT A MOVIE WITH A VAMPIRE INN
LOVE WITH A NON-VAMPIRE GIRL WHOSE OTHER BOYFRIEND IS A WARE WOLF AND ISN'T AS MUCH INTO HER
BUT INTO HER BABY RENEZMAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> OH, YOU CYNIC.
"TWILIGHT" IS LIKE THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO FREE
YOUR SPIRIT AND HAVE A BLATANT AND UTTER DISREGARD FOR LOGIC.
"TWILIGHT" IS LIKE FOX NEWS.
IT'S NOT MEANT FOR YOUR MIND.
YOU WATCH IT WITH YOUR HEART.
(LAUGHTER) AND YOUR GUT.
JON, YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE DEAD INSIDE NOT TO SEE THAT.
>> Jon: WOULD I?
MWAHAHA!
(LAUGHS)
>> JON!
BITE ME IS!
BITE ME!
>> Jon: IT WAS JUST A STUPID EFFECT.
>> NO, BITE ME, I SAY.
I WANT TO LIVE FOREVER, BITE ME!
>> Jon: JOHN HODGMAN,
