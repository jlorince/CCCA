(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST
TONIGHT, A BUSINESS ANDTECHNOLOGY WRITER FOR "NEW
YORK MAGAZINE", HIS NEW BOOKIS CALLED YOUNG MONEY:
INSIDE THE HIDDEN WORLD OFWALL STREET'S POST CRASH
RECRUITS, PLEASE WELCOME TOTHE PROGRAM KEVIN ROOSE.
KEVIN!
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: A FINE BOOK, YOUNG
MONEY THERE YOU SHOULD GETTHAT IT'S A FINE BOOK.
YOU KNOW, I THINK EVERYBODYEXPECTS WOLF OF WALL STREET
TO SOME EXTENT.
THE EXCESS, THE QUAALUDES.
>> THE EXCESS OF QUAALUDES.
>> RIGHT.
>> YOU FOLLOWED EIGHT YOUNGRECRUITS.
AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S MORELIKE THE SAD EYED LAMBS OF
WALL STREET.
THEY REALLY SEEM LIKE THEYARE BEING-- NOT TAKEN TO,
YOU KNOW-- THEY SEEM SAD.
>> WELL, THEY'RE VERY WELLPAID STILL OBVIOUSLY, BUT I
THINK BEFORE THE CRASH IN2008 PEOPLE SORT OF EXPECTED
LIKE CHAMPAGNE AND CALFIERWHEN THEY GOT TO WALL STREET,
INSTEAD THESE GUYS GOT LIKEEXCEL SPREADSHEETS AND CARPAL
TUNNEL.
>> IS IT BECAUSE-- BECAUSEYOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE THAT
YOU FOLLOW, DO YOU THINK YOUFOLLOWED THEM AND THEY SPOKE
TO YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE MORESELF-REFLECTIVE AND SO THE
GROUP IS MAYBE NOT ASREPRESENTATIONAL, OR THAT
THIS REALLY IS SOMETHINGTHAT IS OCCURRING NOW DOWN
THERE?
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S SOMEOF BOTH.
I THINK OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WHOTALK TO A REPORTER, ALL
THESE BANKS HAVE RULESAGAINST PEOPLE TALKING TO
THE PRESS.
SO ANYONE TALKING TO ME WASPUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK
OF GETTING FIRED.
SO IN SOME WAYS YOU HAVE TOBE A LITTLE BIT DISGRUNTLED
OR JUST SORT OF DUMB TO TALKTO A REPORTER.
BUT I THINK-- (LAUGHTER)
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO WITHDISGRUNTLED, HOW ABOUT THAT,
LET'S GO WITH DISGRUNTLED.
>> ALL LOVELY PEOPLE.
>> AND I THINK WHAT'SSHOCKING FOR ME IS THAT AS I
INTERVIEWED THEM THIS WAS NOTAT ALL WHAT THEY EXPECTED.
THEY WERE VERY DEPRESSED,WORKING THESE INSANE HOURS
AND I DON'T THINK ITMEASURED UP TO ANY OF THEIR
EXPECTATIONS.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK-- DIDTHEY EXPECT, SO, WAS IT A
MORAL AND ETHICAL QUANDTRY?
OR JUST IT DIDN'T FIT UP TOTHE GATSBIESQUE DREAM OF
THEM BEING A MASTER OF THEUNIVERSE.
>> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OFBOTH.
I THINK SOME WERE GROUND DOWN BYTHE
100 HOUR WEEKS.
>> Jon: A HUNDRED HOURS.
>> A HUNDRED HOURS THAT IS ALOT OF HOURS.
>> Jon: TREMENDOUS.
I PUT IN-- HOURS(LAUGHTER)
>> SO THEY WORK VERY HARDAND THEIR LIVES ARE VERY
UNPREDICTABLE.
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE IS ASENSE IN WHICH THE CRASH
SORT OF CHANGED WHAT ITMEANT TO WORK ON WALL STREET
AS A YOUNG PERSON.
THIS USED TO BE THE SEXIESTTHING YOU COULD DO.
AND THAT'S WHY FOR SO MANYYEARS, YOU KNOW, A THIRD OF
STUDENTS FROM IVY LEAGUECOLLEGES WOULD GO WORK ON
WALL STREET.
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW ISTHAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE
CASE.
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AREINTERESTED IN GOING TO
SILICON VALLEY AND FEWER AREINTERESTED IN GOING TO
GOLDMAN SACHS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKEEXTRAORDINARY ABUSE OR
EXTRAORDINARY DECADENCETHE STORIES OF THE LONG
HOURS, ONE GENTLEMAN WRITESHE HAD TO WORK, I DON'T KNOW,
FIVE DAYS STRAIGHT, LIKE HECOULDN'T EVER LEAVE AND AT
ONE POINT AT 2 A.M. HE BROKEAND YELLED AT SOMEONE.
AND I'M LIKE-- I DON'T KNOW,THAT HAPPENS HERE AFTER LIKE
FOUR HOURS.
>> RIGHT IN SOME WAYS IT'SHARD TO FEEL SORRY FOR
PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THISMUCH MONEY OUT OF COLLEGE.
BUT MIDWAY THROUGH THE BOOKAS I WAS SHADOWING THESE
EIGHT PEOPLE I SORT OFREALIZED I WOULDN'T SWITCH
LIVES WITH THEM.
THEY'RE MISERABLE AND ITREALLY TAKES A TOLL.
I THINK ALSO CHANGES THEM.
WALL STREET IN SOME WAYS ISLIKE JOINING A NEW RELIGION.
YOU HAVE TO LEARN ENTIRE NEWWAYS TO ACT, TALK, DRESS,
THINK, AND SO OVER THE COURSEOF
THE THREE YEARS THEY SORT OFMORPH.
>> Jon: AND OBVIOUSLY THECIRCUMCISION DOESN'T HELP.
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLYINTERESTING CHAPTER WHERE
YOU STUMBLE UPON AND YOUATTEND THIS INCREDIBLE
DINNER CALLED, IT'S NOT PHIBETA CAPA, IT'S A PLAY ON
THAT.
AND IT IS ALL THE KINGS OFWALL STREET IN THIS VERY
PRIVATE AFFAIR, BASICALLYMAKING FUN OF ALL THOSE THAT
THEY HAVE DESTROYED DURINGTHEIR CAREER.
IT'S A BIZARRE EVENT.
>> IT'S CALLED THE KAPPABETA PHI AN 80-YEAR-OLD WALL
STREET SECRET SOCIETY.
IT'S MADE UP OF FORMER HEADSOF AIG, GOLDMAN SACHS,
CITI GROUP, EVERYONE WHO ISANYONE ON WALL STREET IS
INVOLVED IN THIS THING.
THEY HAVE AN ANNUAL DINNER WHERETHEY TAKE A BUNCH OF
NEOPHYTES AS THE INDUCTEESARE CALLED, AND MAKE THEM
DRESS UP IN DRAG, PERFORMSKITS AND MUSICAL NUMBERS.
AND A LOT OF THOSE SKITS ANDMUSICAL NUMBERS HAVE TO DO
WITH MAKING JOKES ABOUT THEBAILOUTS THERE WAS ONE SONG
THAT THEY DID THAT WAS APARODY OF ABBA'S DANCING
QUEEN THAT WAS CALLEDBAILOUT KING.
>> Jon: BAILOUT KING.
AND THEY ALL KIND OF DANCEAROUND, EVERYONE LOST
MILLIONS-- LIKE THAT KIND OFTHING.
>> EXACTLY.
I FELT LIKE I WAS WITNESSINGLIKE THE ILLUMINATI, IT
WAS LIKE -- --.
>> Jon: THE INDUCTIONCEREMONY TO OPUS DEI AND
WHEN THEY FOUND YOU OUT ITIS A CHILLING MOMENT WHERE THEY
SURROUND YOU LIKEWHAT ARE YOU DOING,
OBSERVING OUR RITUAL.
>> THEY GRABBED MY LAPELS.
THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO BRIBEME TO NOT, TO GET ME TO NOT
WRITE THE STORY.
NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN INSIDETHIS THING FROM THE OUTSIDE.
AND SO I THINK THEY WEREJUST TERRIFIED THAT SOMEONE
HAD SEEN WHAT THEY DO BEHINDCLOSED DOORS.
>> Jon: AND THEY HAVE NOSENSE THAT, WELL, THEY MUST
KNOW THEN THAT IT WOULD BEPERCEIVED NEGATIVELY.
BECAUSE AS SOON AS THEY SAWYOU THEY ARE LIKE --
>> WELL, THEY TRIED-- THEYTRIED TO SAY YOU KNOW, WE'RE
JUST A BUNCH OF FRIENDSHAVING FUN.
THERE IS NOTHING TO SEE HEREIT AND BUT I THINK THEY
KNEW.
I MEAN THIS WAS IN 2012,THIS WAS RIGHT AFTER THE
OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT.
LOTS OF THEM HAD BEEN KEEPING AVERY LOW PROFILE AND
THIS WAS THE EVENT WHERETHEY LET IT ALL HANG OUT.
>> Jon: IT'S AN INCREDIBLELOOK AT A GROUP THAT THE
RECRUITS FEEL DEPRESSED ANDTHE PEOPLE WHO DID IT
ALL STILL DON'T FEELCHASTISED.
STICK AROUND FOR JUST ALITTLE BIT FOR THAT.
>> SURE.
>> Jon: YOUNG MONEY ON THEBOOK SHELVES NOW, KEVIN
ROOSE.
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MOREWHEN WE COME BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
