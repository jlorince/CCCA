>> Jon: YOU ARE ON A RUN LIKENOBODY HAS BEEN ON IN THE FILM
BUSINESS THAT I CAN REMEMBER,THE FIGHTER, SILVER LININGS
PLAYBOOK NOW AMERICAN HUSTLE.
YOU ARE -- DO YOU SLEEP?
DO YOU -- HOW ARE YOU MAKINGTHESE FILMS?
HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR VOICE?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
ARE YOU IN THE ZONE?
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?
>> I HAVE NOT SLEPT VERY MUCH INTHE LAST YEAR BECAUSE I NEVER
MADE TWO FILMS THIS QUICKLYTOGETHER.
YES, I HAVE FOUND MY VOICE WHENI CAME BACK AND MADE A FILM
CALLED "THE FIGHTER" FOUR YEARSAGO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU.
AND I REALIZED THAT, YOU KNOW,TO QUOTE CHRISTIAN BALE INTHE MOVIE MAYBE I
WAS MAKING FILMS MORE FROM THEEARS UP AND YOU HAVE TO COMEFROM THE
FEET UP.
I RELATE TO MY CHARACTERS WHOWERE REINVENTING THEMSELVES,BECAUSE I WAS GOING THROUGH ITMYSELF.
I HAD A HUMBLING EIGHT YEARS.
I LOST MY WAY, GOT DIVORCED MYKID WAS BIPOLAR.
I HAD TO PUT HIM IN A SPECIALSCHOOL.
THEY WERE PEOPLE I HAD KNOWN MYWHOLE LIFE.
I LOVED THESE PEOPLE,WATCHING THEM LIVE AND LOVE AND
SURVIVE, WHAT THEY LIVE FOR, THEMUSIC THEY LOVE, THE FOOD THEYLOVE -- AND
ROMANCE.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD WAKE UPAND BE SOMEBODY WITH SO MUCHROMANCE
AND MUSIC IN MY MOVIES.
>> Jon: AND YOU FEEL AFFECTIONWHETHER THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO
ARE TRYING TO REINVENTTHEMSELVES OR JUST TRYING TO
LIVE THEIR BEST EXISTENCE ANDKIND OF SCRAP THROUGH YOU HAVE
GREAT AFFECTION EVEN FOR THEHUSTLERS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: EVEN FOR THE ONES --IS THAT BECAUSE YOU GOT EMPATHY
FOR THAT STRUGGLE?
>> YES.
I FIND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT EACHONE OF THESE PEOPLE.
I TRY TELL THEIR STORY.
THAT'S WHY THE SCRIPT CAN BEVERY LONG.
IT WAS 170 AND YOU HAVE TO GIVEIT A HAIRCUT BECAUSE I TOLDIT LIKE IT WAS EVERY SINGLE
PERSON'S STORY. IT'S HARD TOWEAVE A TAPESTRY OF FIVE MAJORPERFORMANCES.
I'M PROUD ALL THE ACTORS WERENOMINATED BOTH YEARS ON THESE
TWO PICTURES.
I FEEL EMPATHY FOR THEM. ITREALLY STARTED WITH THECHRISTIAN BALE
CHARACTER IN THE FIGHTER.
WHEN I FIRST READ ABOUT THATGUY, I THOUGHT OH, MY
GOODNESS I DON'T THINK I LIKETHIS PERSON.
WHEN I GOT TO KNOW HIM, THECRACK ADDICT.
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS.
I MET THE REAL PERSON.
ME AND CHRISTIAN BOTH FELT THISWAY.
THE GUY IS A SWEETHEART.
YOU GET HIM ON A BAD DAY.
THAT HAS HAPPENED.
BUT HE IS A SWEETHEART OFA PERSON WHO LOVES HIS FAMILY
AND CHILDREN AND BROTHER, VERYDEVOTED TO HIS BROTHER.
SAME THING IS TRUE OF THISSTORY.
I LOVED THE FACT THAT THIS MANLOVED HIS CHILD, LOVED THE WOMEN
IN HIS LIFE, LOVED HIS ART, WHATHE DID.
HE LOVED DUKE ELLINGTON IN THESTORY WE TOLD.
>> Jon: SUCH A GREAT SCENEWHEN THEY MEET, THE DUKE
ELLINGTON SCENE.
IT'S THAT.
IT'S INFUSING THESE CHARACTERSWITH THAT COMPLEXITY IN THE
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN THEWINDOW THAT YOU HAVE.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK REALLYSEPARATES THESE
MOVIES A BIT BECAUSE THEY ARECHARACTER-DRIVEN.
THEY SHOULDN'T, BY ALL STANDARDSSHOULDN'T MAKE MONEY AND YET
THEY ARE MAKING HUGE MONEY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THEY ARE NOT HOLLYWOOD PICTURES.
THEY ARE NOT REMAKES.
YOU ARE NOT DOING REMAKES.
THERE ARE VERY FEW TALKINGROBOTS IN YOUR FILMS WHO KILL,
BY THE WAY THAT IS MY ONE NOTEIN AMERICAN HUSTLE.
>> NO TALKING ROBOT THAT KILLS.
>> Jon: I WOULD LIKE TO SEETHAT.
>> I'LL TRY TO BE BACK HERE WITHTHAT.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE -- SHOW THEWAY YOU WORK. THE PICTURE OFDAVID DIRECTING.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO THIS -- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE
CHAPERONING A TERRIBLEDATE.
[ LAUGHTER ]YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR AND YOU
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE SMUGGLING YOUINTO TIJUANA.
TELL ME WHAT THAT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT IS HAPPENING?
>> I LIKE TO BE VERY CLOSE TOTHE ACTORS.
I DON'T LIKE TO SIT AT WHAT ISCALLED VIDEO VILLAGE.
ON MANY MOVIE SETS THERE'S VIDEOVILLAGE OFTEN 100 YARDS OR MORE
AWAY FROM THE SET. I LIKE TO BECLOSE TO THEM.
I LIKE THEM TO FEEL ME AND ME TOFEEL THEM.
TAKE IT EASY.
[LAUGHTER]I LIKE TO SHOOT WITH A SMALLCAMERA SO
I CAN BE THERE, A SMALL MONITOR.JENNIFER GOT USED TO IT ANDLIKED IT.
THAT IS JACK HOUSTON SITTINGWITH HER WHO PLAYS THE MAN WHO
ROMANCES HER.
THAT WAS THE SCENE WE WERESHOOTING.
IT'S GREAT WHEN I HAVE ANINTUITIVE CONNECTION WITHTHESE ACTORS.
THEY INSPIRE ME TO WRITE ROLESFOR THEM.
I WROTE FOR JENNIFER, BRADLEYCHRISTIAN AND AMY.
I TALKED TO THEM AND SAID LET'SCREATE A ROLE WORTHY OF YOU
LAYING IT ALL ON THE TABLE.
I'M PRIVILEGED TO HAVE THEIRFRIENDSHIP TO WRITE FOR THEM.
>> Jon: IT SEEMS TO BRING OUTA SPONTANEITY AND --
>> ALIVENESS.
>> Jon: AND A PASSION.
EACH SCENE YOU GET A CRACKLE INTHERE.
EACH SCENE YOU GET A CRACKLE INTHERE.
EACH SCENE YOU GET A CRACKLE INTHERE.
EACH SCENE YOU GET A CRACKLE INTHERE.
>> THANK YOU, JON FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: THREE IN A ROW AREMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT.
