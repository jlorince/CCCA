[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]BUT, OF COURSE, MANY
ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES AREWRINGING THEIR HANDS EVEN FORMER
POT SMOKERS LIKE DAVID BROOKS.
>> MOST OF US AGE OUT OFMARIJUANA USE BECAUSE IT'S NOT
THAT EXCITING WHEN YOU FIND MORESERIOUS PLEASURES.
I THINK THE STATE SHOULDDISCOURAGE THE USE OF MARIJUANA
ON MORAL AND HEALTH GROUNDS.
>> Jon: NOW THAT I NO LONGERUSE IT.
YOU DON'T GET IT BROOKS.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE EXUBERANCE OF THE FEAST.
A GUY WROTE HAPPILY ABOUT HAVINGA ORGY OF EXCESS.
HIS HEAD FOGGED WITH WINE ANDBOURBON.
HE REALIZED HE HATED LIVING INTHE LILY LIVERED WHERE
EVERYTHING IS A PALLID PARODYOF ITSELF.
HE WROTE GONE IS THE GRAND ANDPOINTLESS GESTURE.
I BELIEVE THAT STIRRING TRIBUTETO HEDONISM WAS WRITTEN BY --
(bleep) DAVID BROOKS.
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?
I WONDER HOW HE FORGOT ABOUTTHAT.
