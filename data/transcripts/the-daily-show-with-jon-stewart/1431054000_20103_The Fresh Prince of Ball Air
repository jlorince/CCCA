HE KNEW THAT THE BALLS WEREBEING DEFLATED!
BRADY KNEW!
BY THE WAY, THIS ISN'T JUST ATABLOID SAYING THAT.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"ALSO --
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S NOT REAL, ACTUALLY.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" COVERED IT!
AMONG OBLONG SPORTS EQUIPMENT, ADEFLATION PROBLEM EMERGES.
THEY REALLY DO TAKE THE FUN OUTOF EVERYTHING, DON'T THEY?
BY THE WAY, HOW DID DEFLATEDBALLS QUARTERLY
COVER THIS STORY?OH, THAT'S ODD.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WAS INTHEIR WHEEL HOUSE.
SO TOM BRADY IN ALL OFDEFLATEGATE, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
HE KNEW THAT THEY WEREDEFLATING THE BALLS.
WHAT DID TOM ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUTTHIS THING THAT IS ANOTHER WORD
FOR TESTICLES?
>> THE INDEPENDENT REPORTCONCLUDES IT WAS MORE PROBABLE
THAN NOT THAT BRADY WAS AT LEASTGENERALLY AWARE TEAM PERSONNEL
WERE DEFLATING FOOTBALLS BEFOREA CRITICAL PLAYOFF GAME.
>> Jon: GENERALLY AWARE?MORE PROBABLE THAN NOT?
AFTER THE STORY BROKE, BRADY WASTEXTING THE BALL GUY LIKE HE WAS
A LATE NIGHT BOOTY CALL.
WHAT ABOUT THIS?
>> THE WELLS REPORT SINGLES OUTTWO LONG TIME MEMBERS OF THE
PATRIOTS LOCKER ROOM STAFF ANDSOME OF THE MOST TELLING
EVIDENCE IS A TRAIL OF TEXTMESSAGES BETWEEN THOSE TWO
LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANTS, ONE OFTHEM CALLING HIMSELF THE
DEFLATOR.
>> Jon: COME ON! HE CALLSHIMSELF THE DEFLATOR!
ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE LOCKERROOM AT THE BEHEST OF
TOM BRADY CALLS HIMSELFTHE DEFLATOR!
WHAT WAS THE OTHER GUY'SNICKNAME?
JOEY CHEATS AT FOOTBALL?
WILL NONE OF THOMAS BRADY'STEAMMATES RISE TO DEFEND THEIR
CHAMPION?
>> WHAT ABOUT ALL THEFUNDRAISING FOR THE KIDS?
NO ONE EVER WANTS TO EXPAND ONTHAT, FOR THE KIDS, THE CHARITY
EVENTS.
NO, THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THESTORY FOR THE DEFLATEGATE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THANK YOU.

FOR REMINDING US THAT THESEATHLETES LIVES ARE COMPLEX AND
THAT MUCH OF THE GOOD WORK THESEATHLETES DO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
GOES UNSUNG AND THAT OUR FOCUSON THEIR FOIBLES CAN REDUCE

CARICATURES.
I'M SORRY. I INTERRUPTED YOU,THOUGH. YOU WERE SAYING?
>> YOU KNOW, THESE SURE AREN'TDEFLATING.
THESE ARE ONLY INFLATING.
SO GET READY BECAUSE I'M GOINGTO BE READY.
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING YOUCAN DEFLATE -- THESE NUTS!

BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE SO AT EASEWITH YOUR OWN DEVIOUS
MACHINATIONS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD ASYOUR FRIEND GRONK SO
ELOQUENTLY PUT IT, THESENUTS TO SAY THAT.
I MEAN, WHY STOP AT DEFLATING?
WHY NOT LACE THE BALL ON BOTHSIDES.
OR [BLEEP] IT, JUST STARTQ.B.-ING ON STILTS?
HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH, BRADY? HOWMUCH IS ENOUGH?
FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOU HAVE ITALL!
IF YOU LOOK UP TALENT IN THEDICTIONARY, GUESS WHOSE PICTURE
COMES UP!
FRED ASTAIRE, THE MAN MOVED LIKEAN ANGEL.
HE WAS AN ANGEL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, BRADY?
YOU'RE GOOD, TOO.
THE GREAT ONES DON'T NEED TOCHEAT.
DID MICHAEL JORDAN CHEAT TO GETHIS SIX CHAMPIONSHIPS?
NO.
IN FACT, MICHAEL JORDAN DECIDEDTO PLAY A SPORT HE SUCKED AT
JUST TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLEA CHANCE TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP.
HAND ME THAT BAT, JORDAN SAID,I'M SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW IT
WORKS, AS HE GOT ON A BUS TOBIRMINGHAM.
TOM, IF YOU COULDN'T SHOW SOMEINTEGRITY FOR YOURSELF AND THE
CHILDREN WHO WORSHIP YOU, ATLEAST SHOW PRIDE IN YOUR TEAM.
YOU'RE A PATRIOT, TOM BRADY, ATEAM NAMED AFTER THIS COUNTRY'S
MOST CHERISHED POST-9/11LEGISLATIVE SURVEILLANCE ACT.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET ME JUST SAY THIS -- FROM NOWON, WE AS A COUNTRY ARE GOING TO
BE WATCHING YOUR BALLS LIKE AHAWK.
AND NOT JUST THOSE BALLS --THOSE NUTS AS WELL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AND BY THE WAY...
IF YOU THINK I WOULDN'T CHASTISEYOU IF YOU HAD COMMITTED THESE
ACTS WHILE IN MY TEAM IN ANEW YORK GIANTS UNIFORM, IF YOU
THINK I WOULDN'T CHASTISE YOUFOR THAT, THAT WOULD BE CORRECT.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
