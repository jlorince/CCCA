MY DAD OUT OF BUSINESS.
WE NEED TO FIX A BROKENENTITLEMENT SYSTEM.
THE HORSE SUT O OF THE BARN.

>> Jon: THAT GOT WEIRD REALLYFAST.
MY PLATFORM IS, LET'S PUT MYDAD OUT OF BUSINESS AND BEAT
UP THAT [BLEEP] HORSE -- THEREHE IS, GET HIM, EVERYBODY.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROMUS, HORSE.
IN FACT, I THINK WE HAVESOME FOOTAGE FROM CHRISTIE'S
FIRST CAMPAIGN AD.
WHAT IS IT WITH CHRISCHRISTIE AND HIS DESIRE TO
FORCIBLY CONFINE FARMANIMALS.
FIRST, IT'S GUESSTATIONALCRATES FOR PIGS AND HE'S
LIKE YEAH, DON'T LET THEPIGS TURN AROUND AND NOW
IT'S HORSES.
GOVERNOR, WILL YOU NOT BESATISFIED UNTIL EVERY HOOVED
ANIMAL IN THE COUNTRY ISIMPRISONED.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE TOTAKE CHRISIEST'S WORD ON WHAT
KIND OF PRESIDENT HE WOULD BE.
THE RESIDENTS OF NEW JERSEYALREADY ANSWERED THAT
QUESTION LIKE A COUPLE OFMONTHS AGO.
>> THE POLLS IN NEW JERSEYRIGHT NOW SAY BY A 65% TO
29% MARGIN THE NEW JERSEYVOTERS SAY YOU WOULD NOT
MAKE A GOOD PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AND LET ME REMIND YOU,THOSE PEOPLE LIVE IN NEW JERSEY.
SO THEIR EXPECTATIONS FORGOOD GOVERNANCE IS ALWAYS
ALREADY JUST BOTTOM BAR,INCREDIBLY --
65% OF RESIDENTS OF CHRISTIE'SHOME STATE THINK HE WOULD
SUCK AS PRESIDENT.
LET'S HEAR SOME STRAIGHT-TALKFROM CHRISTIE ABOUT WHAT THAT
MEANS.
>> A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE,THAT 65% WANT ME TO STAY.
AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM LOTS OFPEOPLE IN TOWN HALL, DON'T
LEAVE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENTBECAUSE WE WANT TO YOU STAY.

NO, THEY THINK I WOULD BE GREAT,THEY DON'T WANT ME TO LEAVE--
NO, SHE SAID SHE BROKE UP WITHME BECAUSE I'M TOO GOOD FOR HER.
THAT'S WHY.
SHE SAID I DESERVED SOMEONEBETTER.
THAT'S WHY.
HER WORDS, NOT MINE.
SHE WAS ALL LIKE, I'M NOT[BLEEP] YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE
I WANT TO.
IT'S-- HERE'S YOUR REALPROBLEM, GOVERNOR.
LET'S DO SOME STRAIGHT TALK.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M GONNA MISS THIS A LITTLEBIT -- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S NOT THAT NEW JERSIANSLOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO LET YOU
GO, IT'S THAT YOU'VE ALREADYFINISHED SECOND IN THE LOUD,
NORTHEASTERN EGO MANIACPRIMER.
>> UNFORTUNATELY FOR CRISTIE,THERE'S ANOTHER UNFILTERED
COLOURFUL CHARACTER ALREADYIN THE GOP FIELD.
>> POLITICIANS ARE ALL TALKAND NO ACTION.
IT'S TRUE.
ALL TALK, IT'S ALL BULL [BLEEP].
>> Jon: HOW FAR MUSTCHRISTIE HAVE FALLEN TO BE A
TWO-TERM SITTING GOVERNORUNFAVOURABLY COMPARED TO A
PERFUME SELLING ESCAULATOEURLIKE DONALD TRUMP.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY CHRISTIE HASOTHER TROUBLES.
UNDER HIM, NEW JERSEYHAD CREDIT DOWNGRADED EIGHT
TIMES, UNEMPLOYMENT RUNRAMPANT, HIS CAPOS BLOCKED
TRAFFIC FOR POLITICALRETRIBUTION.
THE SANDY REBUILDING EFFORTREMAINS PATHETIC.
HE RAIDED PENSIONS AFTERPROMISING NOT TO HIS ABOMINAL
EXXON SETTLEMENT, NOT THAT THEREPUBLICANS WILL GIVE A [BLEEP]
ABOUT THAT STUFF BUT HE CROSSEDTHE LINE FOR REPUBLICANS.
>> HE ANGERED CONSERVATIVESBY EMBRACING PRESIDENT OBAMA
DURING HURRICANE SANDY.
>> I GOT SO MAD AT YOU, SIXDAYS BEFORE THE 2012
ELECTION, AND YOU LET THEPRESIDENT COME TO NEW
JERSEY.
OBAMA AND CHRISTIE WALKINGARM IN AN ARM ALONG THE
JERSEY SHORE IN THEAFTERMATH OF HURRICANE
SANDY.
>> AND THEN THERE WAS THEHUG.
>> THERE WAS NO HUG.
>> Jon: THERE WAS A HUG.
THAT IS WHY CHRISCHRISTIE WILL NOT WIN THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.
HE MADE THE UNPARDONABLECRIME OF TREATING BARAK OBAMA
LIKE A PERSON.
THAT IS THE INSURMOUNTABLECAMPAIGN HURDLE.
WHEN BARACK OBAMA ARRIVED TOLEND AID TO YOUR HURRICANE-
RAVAGED STATE, YOU SHOOK HISHAND.
WHY DID YOU NOT SLAY HIM INA KLINGON HONOR DUAL.
IT'S WHAT RONALD REAGANWOULD HAVE DONE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
