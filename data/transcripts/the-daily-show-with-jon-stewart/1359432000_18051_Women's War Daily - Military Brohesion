[BLEEP] CRAZY.
ALL RIGHT.
OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE EXPLORES THIS MORE IN DEPTH WITH THIS REPORT
>> Reporter: LAST WEEK DEFENSE SECRETARY LEON PANETTA MADE MILITARY HISTORY WHEN HE LIFTED
THE BAN ON WOMEN SERVING IN COMBAT.
IMMEDIATELY, OBJECTIONS WERE RAISED.
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE PHYSICALITY OF WOMEN AND MEN
>> IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SEX ASSAULT PROBLEM
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE Reporter: AUTHOR AND MILITARY EXPERT KINGSLEY BROWN
>> WOMEN IN COMBAT POSITIONS ARE A THREAT TO MILITARY COHESION.
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT MEN CAN ACTUALLY BOND WITH WOMEN THE WAY THEY BOND WITH OTHER WOMEN
>> Reporter: SO WOMEN CAN DISRUPT ROMANCE IN COMBAT ZONES?
>> ALMOST BY DEFINITION.
Reporter: WHO ARE THESE FATIGUE HAGS JEOPARDIZING ALL THAT MILITARY COHESION?
MEET MARINE CORPS CAPTAIN ZOE BIDDLE A PLAINTIFF IN THE LAWSUIT TO LIFT THE BAN ON WOMEN
IN COMBAT
>> I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO SERVE IN ALL ROLES
>> Reporter: WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE TO BREAK UP THE BAND OF BROTHERS?
DON'T BE THE YOKO
>> UNIT COHESION IS BASED AROUND COMMON MISSION AND BEING HELD TO STANDARDS.
>> Reporter: WE SAID TO AN EXPERT IN THE WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION, DO YOU WANT TO
KNOW WHAT HE SAID IN
>> SURE Reporter: PICK A NUMBER FROM ONE TO FOUR
>> TWO.
Reporter: BUT IT TURNS OUT KINGSLEY HAD A LOT MORE TO SAY.
>> YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO WOMEN ADDED TO THE GROUP AND NOW EVERYBODY IS VYING FOR THEIR
ATTENTION
>> Reporter: WOMEN ARE DISTRACTING SOME
>> THEY ARE DISTRACTING.
Reporter: WHAT IF THE WOMAN IS NOT HETEROSEXUAL?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT IT MATTERS Reporter: THEY'RE STILL GOING TO TRY TO HIT THAT
>> THEY'RE STILL GOING TO TRY TO HIT THAT
>> Reporter: I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE OUT THAT INSURGENT BUT CHECK OUT MAJOR TURNBULL OVER HERE.
BOING BOING
>> THAT'S REALLY NOT A FUNNY THING BECAUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGE IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY.
IT RUINS CAREERS
>> Reporter: REALLY.
RIGHT.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT RUINS MEN'S CAREERS.
THERE YOU ARE AT THE FRONT LINES LOOKING SO CUTE IN YOUR CAMO AND SOMEONE COMES UP AND SEXUALLY
ASSAULTS YOU.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO FEEL GUILTY FOR WRECKING THAT GUY'S CAREER?
>> NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.
Reporter: GETTING A LOT OF BLOW-BACK HERE.
DO YOU WANT TO RESCHEDULE THIS INTERVIEW FOR WHEN YOU'RE NOT HAVING YOUR PERIOD?
SOUNDS LIKE ZOE JUST DOESN'T GET HOW WOMEN SCREW UP THE GUY-NAMICS OF ACTUAL COMBAT
>> THERE HAVE BEEN 280,000 WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN OVER THE LAST DECADE.
OVER 130 WOMEN HAVE DIED IN THESE WARS.
IN MODERN WARFARE THE LINES ARE BLURRED IF THEY EXIST AT ALL BETWEEN WHAT THE FRONT LINES ARE
AND WHAT IS A SAFE ZONE.
>> Reporter: DO THEY EVEN CALL IT THE FRONT LINES ANYMORE?
>> THEY DO NOT.
Reporter: WHAT DO THEY CALL IT?
>> AFGHANISTAN.
WOMEN ARE BEING SHOT AT.
BUT THE MILITARY DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO SERVE IN THOSE POSITIONS OFFICIALLY.
THAT HURTS THEIR CHANCES FOR PROMOTION.
FOR EXAMPLE MARY JENNINGS IS A HELICOPTER PILOT
>> Reporter: ZOE DISHED THE DATES ON HER MILITARY GAL PALS
>> SERGEANT JENNIFER HUNT WAS ON A CONVOY
>> Reporter: APPARENTLY THERE ARE ALREADY TONS OF FEMALE SOLDIERS TOTALLY KICKING ASS IN
COMBAT ZONES.
>> LEE ANN HESTER RECEIVED THE SILVER STAR FOR HER ACTIONS UNDER FIRE
>> Reporter: YOU GO, GIRL.
DO YOU HAVE GIRL TALK IN AFGHAN STA?
LET'S DO A LITTLE ROLE PLAY.
I'LL BE A WOMAN WHO SERVED HER COUNTRY BRAVELY AND I'LL BE YOU.
MY NAME IS MAJOR MATTER JENNINGS.
I CHASED GROUND FIRE AFTER MY HELICOPTER WAS SHOT DOWN
>> YOU WEREN'T IN THE INFANTRY.
YOU WEREN'T TAKING THE FIGHT WITH 100-POUND PACK
>> Reporter: A PURPLE [BLEEP]
HEART
>> I SINCERELY SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE
>> Reporter: BUT?
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD SERVE IN COMBAT
>> Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT POINT.
EXCEPT THAT WOMEN ARE ALREADY THERE, MOTHER [BLEEP].
SEE, IN MY WORLD WOMEN HAVE ALREADY BEEN SERVING IN COMBAT FOR TWO WARS, BUT KINGSLEY IS
LIVING IN A SIMPLER TIME.
>> MEN JOIN THE INFANTRY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FIGHT
>> Reporter: EXCUSE ME FOR ONE SECOND.
(MAYBERRY THEME)
>> GIRLS BECOME WOMEN BY GETTING OLDER.
BOYS BECOME MEN BY ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING, BY PROVING SOMETHING
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY MET A WOMAN BEFORE?
>> SEVERAL.
Reporter: A WOMAN WHO DID NOT WANT TO STRANGLE YOU?
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE REALLY STUCK IN ANOTHER ERA?
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE IS ON MY SIDE.
WOMEN HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR TEN YEARS AND EVENTUALLY WE'LL JUST KEEP DOING OUR THING
>> Reporter: WELL SAID.
I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO.
♪ LOVE LIFT US UP WHERE WE BELONG ♪♪ ♪ WHERE THE EAGLE FLIES ♪♪ ♪ AND THE MOUNTAINS RISE ♪♪
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
