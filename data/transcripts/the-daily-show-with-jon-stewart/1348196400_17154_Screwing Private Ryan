GRETCHEN, HUH?
HEY.
MOVING ON TO OUR MAIN STORY.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR VETERANS, 11%.
3% HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION.
LUCKILY THE SENATE TODAY HAS TAKEN UP A BILL THAT WOULD HELP GET JOBS FOR THE OVER 700,000 VETERANS CURRENTLY
OUT OF WORK.
>> ON CAPITOL HILL LEGISLATION AIMED AT PUTTING THE NATION'S VETERANS BACK TO WORK HAS BEEN BLOCKED IN
THE SENATE.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT, I FORGOT.
IT'S TIME FOR OUR RECURRING SEGMENT, OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE DOING SOMETHING WOULD HAVE THE... YES, THE SENATE VOTED
ON A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE A BILLION DOLLARS TO VETERANS, A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE A BILLION DOLLARS TO VETERANS
TO HELP THEM GET JOBS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND OR FEDERAL LAND.
THE BILL WAS AFFIRMED BY 58 SENATORS, REJECTED BY ONLY 40, THUS FAILING TO PASS BECAUSE APPARENTLY IN SENATE
WORLD 58 TO 40 IS A LOSING SCORE AND YOU EAT OUT OF YOUR ANUS AND [BLEEP] OUT OF YOUR EARS.
(LAUGHTER) LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST AMERICA'S FIGHTING MEN, OKLAHOMA SENATOR TOM COBURN WHO OPPOSES ON GROUNDS OF
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.
>> IF, IN FACT, WE'RE GOING TO START ADDRESSING THE BIGGER ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU GOT TO
QUIT PLAYING FELONIOUS ACCOUNTING WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT BILL DID.
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF, PARDON MY WORD, CRAP THAT CONGRESS HAS DONE FOR YEARS.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS BILL IS FELONIOUS CRAP!
(LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, ALSO THE NAME OF MY JAZZ FUSION BAND BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.
I WAS... THE SENATOR... YEAH.
HERE IS THE SAD PART.
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN LAST YEAR.
THE SENATOR AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES FELT THAT THE PROPOSED METHODS OF PAYING FOR THIS BILL IMPOSING
PENALTIES ON MEDICARE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN DELINQUENT ON TAXES WAS A LESS THAN SOLID FISCAL FOUNDATION.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, I'M JUST SPIT BALLING HERE, HOW DID WE PAY FOR THE ACTUAL WARS THAT MADE THESE
INDIVIDUALS VETERANS WHO NOW NEED JOBS?
>> ENGAGING IN ACCOUNTING GIMMICKS OVER THE YEARS LEAVING BIG TICKET ITEMS LIKE WAR SPENDING OUT OF
OFFICIAL BUDGETS.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT!
BY NOT PAYING FOR THEM!
(LAUGHTER) AT ALL!
WE DIDN'T EVEN PUT THE WARS ON LAY AWAY AND PAY THEM DOWN A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.
ONLY TAKING THE WARS HOME WHEN WE WERE DONE WITH THEM.
OF COURSE!
WE COULD HAVE FUNDED IT, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG FOR AMERICA.
OBVIOUSLY SENATOR COBURN WAS NOT IN THE SENATE WHEN THE WAR BEGAN BUT I'M SURE THE MINUTE HE GOT THERE HE
BROUGHT THE FISCAL INTEGRITY HE IS FAMOUS FOR TO EVEN THE SUPPLEMENT WAR FUNDING BILLS.
>> THE CONGRESS HAS TAKEN A VACATION WHILE WE HAVEN'T PASSED THE SUPPLEMENT FOR OUR TROOPS.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE OUTRAGED THAT WE WOULD LEAVE HERE BEFORE WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF OUR TROOPS.
I THINK IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE.
>> Jon: WHAT KIND OF FELONIOUS CRAP...  (LAUGHTER) SO ONCE AGAIN, $800 BILLION UNFUNDED FOR WAR, A BILLION
DOLLARS, BUT PAID FOR IN A WAY YOU AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT TO HELP THE GUYS WHO FOUGHT THE WAR GET JOBS AFTERWARDS,
WE'RE NOT MADE OUT OF MONEY, PEOPLE.
AND THAT'S WHY... OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE DOING SOMETHING WOULD HELP THE... WE'LL BE
