>> Jon: ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERYMUCH, JORDAN.
I APPRECIATE IT. ALRIGHT.
WELL, BY NOW, WE'VE ALL HAD ANOPPORTUNITY TO DIGEST, IN ALL
ITS PRUTRID GLORY THE SHOCKINGACTS CARRIED OUT BY OUR
GOVERNMENT AFTER 9/11 IN THENAME OF KEEPING US SAFE FROM
FORCED RECTAL HYDRATION TO AHALF NAKED PRISONER DYING OF
HYPOTHERMIA, CHAINED TO A FLOOR.
ON THE OTHER HAND, ISN'T 24HOURS LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO FEEL
BAD ABOUT OURSELVES AS ACOUNTRY?
( LAUGHTER )I MEAN, THERE'S GOT TO BE MYRIAD
WAYS WE CAN MINIMIZE THIS.
TO THE PUSH-BACK MOBILE.
>> GEORGE TENET WAS THE HEAD OFTHE C.I.A.
HE MAINTAINS IT WASN'T TORTURE.
>> DICK CHENEY IS SLAMMING THERELEASE OF THIS REPORT AND THE
REFERENCES TO, HE SAYS,SO-CALLED TORTURE.
>> GENERAL, DO YOU THINK THATWHAT TOOK PLACE WAS TORTURE?
>> NO, LEGALLY NOT.
>> Jon:  LOOK, I UNDERSTANDTHE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT PUTS
THESE GENTLEMEN IN A STRESSFULAND PAINFUL POSITION, IN THAT
THEY WOULD PROBABLY SAY ANYTHINGTO MAKE IT STOP, BUT--
( LAUGHTER )NOT TORTURE?
I MEAN, SLEEP DEPRIVATION.
FORCED STRESS POSITIONS.
WATERBOARDING.
BEATINGS -- I'M SORRY, I'MSORRY.
I'M READING THAT FROM WHAT THEGERMANS DID TO U.S. SOLDIERS AND
OUR ALLIES IN WORLD WAR II,WHICH WE SUBSEQUENTLY TREATED
AS WAR CRIMES AND PROSECUTEDAT THE NUREMBURG TRIALS.
MY CONFUSION.
BUT IF IT'S NOT TORTURE, IT'SNOT TORTURE. CASED CLOSED.
MOVING ON.
THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OFCAMBRIDGE BID A FOND FAREWELL TO
THE BIG APPLE TODAY--( COUGHING ).
>> JON. BEANS DON'T LIE.
>> Jon:  WHY MUST YOU HAUNTME, JELLYBEAN CARNIE?
ALRIGHT. FINE. (BLEEP) IT.
WHY ELSE SHOULDN'T WE BERELEASING THIS REPORT?
>> THIS IS REOPENING AN OLDWOUND.
>> WE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY ALL OLDNEWS.
>> TO COME BACK NOW THIS MANYYEARS LATER IS NOT GOING TO DO
ANYBODY ANY GOOD.
>> Jon: YES, SOMANY YEARS LATER.
( LAUGHTER )IT ALL HAPPENED IN THE YEAR 2000
AND OUGHT TWO.
I REMEMBER CARS RAN ON GASOLINE,AND SPIDER-MAN WAS PLAYED BY ONE
TOBIAS MAGUIRE.
( LAUGHTER )NOT THIS NEW-FANGLED ANDREW
GARFIELD.
( LAUGHTER )SO APPARENTLY, WHAT WE DID
WASN'T TORTURE. ANDEVEN IF IT WAS TORTURE,
WHO CAN REMEMBER ALLTHE WAY BACK THEN?
( LAUGHTER )BUT, OF COURSE, WHILE IT'S BEST
NOT TO REMEMBER THINGS FROM THATTIME THAT IMPLICATE US, SURELY
WE MUST NEVER FORGET THE THINGSTHAT WILL EXONERATE US.
>> IT IS CRITICAL TO REMEMBER,AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS,
THE FEAR OF A FOLLOW-ON ATTACKWAS PERVASIVE, AND IT WAS
GENUINE.
THE NATION WAS TRAUMATIZED.
>> Jon:  BUT WE WERE SCARED.
SURELY, A TEMPORARY STATE OFAGITATION CAN BE USED AS A
DEFENSE OF ANY CRIME.
FOR INSTANCE, MY CLIENT,MR. JEFFREY DAHMER, YES, HE
KILLED AND ATE HIS NEIGHBORS,BUT AT THE TIME, HE WAS HUNGRY.
( LAUGHTER )NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE, HE'S
PLEASINGLY FULL, AND HISDEPRAVITY HAS CEASED.
( LAUGHTER )SO, WE DIDN'T TORTURE, WE THINK.
IT WAS SO LONG AGO THAT WE DON'TEVEN REALLY REMEMBER, BUT WE DO
REMEMBER BEING SCARED.
HERE'S HOW TWISTED UP YOU HAVETO BE TO TRY NOT TO ADDRESS THE
REALITY OF OUR ACTIONS.
THIS IS FORMER BUSHADMINISTRATION COMMUNICATION
DIRECTOR NICOLLE WALLACE,EXPLAINING WHY NO MATTER WHAT WE
DO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TOKILL US IN AMERICA.
AND WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVINGTHIS CONVERSATION ABOUT TORTURE
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKEPEOPLE WANT TO KILL US, ALL
DURING THE SAME PROGRAM.
>> I THINK WORDS MATTER.
I THINK YOU MADE THAT PRETTYCLEAR THIS MORNING.
AND SENATOR KERRY IS, I THINK,CORRECTLY CONCERNED THAT DEBATES
LIKE THE ONE WE'RE HAVING RIGHTNOW MAY ENDANGER AMERICAN LIVES.
THE NOTION THAT WE WE DO AFFECTSTHE BEHAVIOR OF TERRORISTS, IT'S
A LIE.
IT'S A LIE PERPETRATED BYPOLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND BY
LIBERALS, AND IT'S DANGEROUS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE ( BLEEP ).
HAVING THIS DEBATE PUTS US INDANGER BUT WHAT WE DO -- SEE,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THETORTURE REPORT.
WORDS SPEAK LOUDER THAN ACTIONS.
NOW WE GET TO THE REAL ARGUMENTTHAT NO MATTER WHO WE SAY WE ARE
AS A COUNTRY, DON'T THE ENDSJUSTIFY THE MEANS?
>> PEOPLE AT THE C.I.A. WHOWORKED WITH THIS PROGRAM KNOW IT
WORKED.
>> AN AWFUL LOT OF ACTIONABLEINTELLIGENCE COLLECTED UNDER THE
C.I.A. PROGRAM-->> SOMETIMES YOU DO GET THE
INFORMATION YOU NEED.
>> THE PROGRAM HAD PROVEN ITSWORTH.
>> HAS PRODUCED RESULTS, DOESPRODUCE RESULTS.
>> PEOPLE WILL TALK WHEN THEY'REUNDER DURESS.
>> Jon:  YES, GENERALLYSOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF,
"OW.
STOP.
OW.
I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING-- OW."
I DON'T HAVE THE WORDS ANYMORE.
I WISH I HAD AN ELOQUENCE THAT ICOULD EXPRESS.
>> OUR ENEMIES ACT WITHOUTCONSCIENCE.
WE MUST NOT.
>> Jon:  OH, MY GOD.
UNCLE JOHNNY.
IS THAT YOU?
( LAUGHTER )I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
DID THE STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESSJUST PULL INTO TRUTH TOWN?
>> THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT MAKESCLEAR THAT ACTING WITHOUT
CONSCIENCE ISN'T NECESSARY. ITISN'T EVEN HELPFUL.
PRACTICES THATI BELIEVE NOT ONLY FAILED THEIR
PURPOSE TO SECURE ACTIONABLEINTELLIGENCE TO PREVENT FURTHER
ATTACKS ON THE U.S. AND OURALLIES, BUT ACTUALLY DAMAGED OUR
SECURITY INTERESTS.
>> Jon: YEAH. ( BLEEP ).
I FORGOT HOW ( BLEEP ) HIGH GOODMcCAIN MAKES ME FEEL WHEN I
HAVEN'T HAD ANY FOR A WHILE!
OH, MAN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )OH!
COME ON, GOOD McCAIN!
GIVE ME ANOTHER HIT, BROTHER!
>> IN THE END, TORTURE'S FAILURETO SERVE ITS INTENDED PURPOSE
ISN'T THE MAIN REASON TO OPPOSEITS USE.
IT'S ABOUT US.
IT'S ABOUT WHO WE WERE, WHO WEARE, AND WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE.
IT'S ABOUT HOW WE REPRESENTOURSELVES TO THE WORLD.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: I DIDN'T THINK I'DEVER SEE YOU AGAIN, LIKE
LASERDISCS OR MYSPACE,BUT YOU'RE BACK.
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME AGAIN.
TAKE US HOME, SENATOR.
>> THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES A HARDPILL TO SWALLOW.
