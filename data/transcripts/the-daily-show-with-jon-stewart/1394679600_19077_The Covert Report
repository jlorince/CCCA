BUT FIRST REMEMBER IN 2005 WEFOUND OUT THAT AFTER 9/11
SOMETIME IN 2002 THE C.I.A. WAS
AUTHORIZED TO USE INTERROGATIONTECHNIQUES ON PRISONERS THAT
COULD BE DESCRIBED AS TORTURE.
DID I SAY COULD?
I MEANT SHOULD HAVE BEENDESCRIBED AS TORTURE BUT FOR
SOME REASON WERE NOT DESCRIBEDTHAT WAY BUT INSTEAD DESCRIBED
AS ENHANCED INTERROGATION ORFREEDOM TICKLING.
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE OUTRAGE.
ACTUALLY YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THEOUTRAGE BECAUSE REALLY NO ONE
WAS THAT OUTRAGED ABOUT IT.
CONGRESS DID NOT GET AROUND TOFULLY INVESTIGATING THESE
TORTURE REVELATIONS UNTIL 2009.
I CANNOT REMEMBER WHY IT TOOK SOLONG TO -- I WISH -- HMMMM -- I
CAN -- I'M SORRY I DON'T MEAN ICANNOT REMEMBER, I MEAN I WISH I
COULD NOT REMEMBER WHY.
FUNNY STORY ABOUT CONGRESS'SINVESTIGATION TO THE C.I.A.'S
USE OF TORTURE.
>> THEY SAY DURING THISINVESTIGATION THE C.I.A.ACCESSED
THEIR COMPUTERS AND THAT CERTAINDAMNING INFORMATION JUST STARTED
VANISHING.
>> Jon: NOW ORIGINALLY THE
INFORMATION THAT VANISHED,CONGRESS BELIEVED IT TO BE
SUICIDE.
[LAUGHTER]BECAUSE THE INFORMATION LEFT
THIS NOTE:[LAUGHTER]

SOON SENATE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRDIANE FEINSTEIN WHO WAS LEADING
THE INVESTIGATION REALIZEDTHAT THE C.I.A. WAS POSSIBLY
SNEAKING ON THE COMMITTEE'SCOMPUTERS AND ASSASSINATING DATA
WHICH IS APPARENTLY NO BUENO.
>> THE C.I.A. SEARCH MAY HAVEVIOLATED THE FOURTH AMENDMENT,
THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACTAS WELL AS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER
12333.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TELL YOUSOMETHING LISTEN CLOSELY.
YOU CAN VIOLATE THE FOURTHAMENDMENT AND THE COMPUTER FRAUD

[ LAUGHTER ]ACTUALLY EXECUTIVE ORDER 12333
WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BY REAGANFORBIDDING DOMESTIC SPYING ON
CITIZENS. HOW MANY OFTHESE FILES DID THE C.I.A.
EXTRAORDINARILY RENDITION?
A FILE, TWO FILES?
>> THIS INCLUDED ROUGHLY 870DOCUMENTS OR PAGES OF DOCUMENTS
THAT WERE REMOVED IN FEBRUARY2010.
AND SECONDLY, ROUGHLY ANOTHER 50THAT WERE REMOVED IN MID MAY
2010.
>> Jon: THEY ALSO AT THE SAMETIME RESET MY HOMEPAGE TO MSN

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]C.I.A. DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY IN YOURDEFENSE?
>> AS FAR AS THE ALLEGATIONS OF,YOU KNOW, C.I.A. HACKING INTO
SENATE COMPUTERS, NOTHING COULDBE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.
WE WOULDN'T DO THAT I MEANTHAT'S -- THAT'S JUST BEYOND
THE, YOU KNOW, THE SCOPE OFREASON.
