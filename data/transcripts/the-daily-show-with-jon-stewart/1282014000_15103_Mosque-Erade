HOLIDAY-INN-OCAUST.
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE MUSLIMS WILL TAKE ANY REASON TO PARTY ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF
CONTINUING CONTROVERSY.
IT'S AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WEIGHED IN ON FRIDAY.
>> I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONS THAT THIS ISSUE ENTKPWEPBDERS AND GROUND ZERO IS INDEED
HALLOWED GROUND.
BUT LET ME BE CLEAR, AS A CITIZEN AND AS PRESIDENT I BELIEVE THAT MUSLIMS HAVE THE
RIGHT TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: BOOM, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
BOOM, THERE YOU GO.
YOU CAN'T BE ANY MORE CLEAR THAN THAT.
LET ME CLEAR, USUALLY WHEN OBAMA SAYS LET ME BE CLEAR, HE IS ABOUT TO GET INTO UNCLEAR (bleep).
HE SAYS LET ME BE CLEAR THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD NOT UNSUPPORT THE
KIND OF PROJECT THIS ISN'T.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS WAS.
THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLED GUY THAT -- SORRY, THERE'S MORE.
>> I WAS NOT COMMENTING AND I WILL NOT COMMENT ON THE WISDOM TO MAKE THE DECISION FOUGHT A
MOSQUE THERE.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S WALKING IT BACK A LITTLE BIT THERE.
THAT REMINDS ME OF HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN YES WE CAN BUT SHOULD WE.
[LAUGHTER]
WE CAN BUT -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD.
IS IT RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY CLEAR THOUGH THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES YOU FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
REALLY, YOU ARE LOVING THE PUNS?
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TOSS THEM AROUND IN LIKE 20 SECONDS.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHERE.
WHO KNEW THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAD THE SAME MANTRA HAS CENTURY 12 -- 21:  LOCATION,
LOCATION, LOCATION.
THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST LOCATION.
>> I HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE CONTROVERSIAL IMAM.
>> HE IS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE PROPOSED MOSQUE.
>> THE RADICAL IMAM WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS PLANNING ON DOING IN THE CULTURAL CENTER.
>> SHOULD HE EVEN BE IN THE U.S.
>> Jon: IMAM RAUF.
HE IS A RADICAL TERRORIST SYMPATHIZER.
I HAD NO IDEA BECAUSE THE NAME IS SO IDEA -- FAMILIAR.
WHERE I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE?
>> TO MY IMMEDIATE LEFT IMAM FEISAL ABDUL RAUF.
>> Jon: HE WAS ON FOX.
TAKE THE SHOT.
TASE HIM.
GET HIM IN A HEADLOCK.
YOU ARE RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.
PUNCH HIM DOOCY STYLE.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO HOW IS IT EXACTLY THAT WE KNOW RAUF ISN'T MODERATE?
PERHAPS A SCHOLAR FAMILIAR WITH MIDDLE EAST ISSUES TOLD US SO, A TEACHER, A HEALER OF SORTS.
>> WHAT DID THIS MODERATE SAY JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER 9/11?
WELL, OF COURSE WHAT ALL MODERATES WOULD SAY -- QUOTE -- "I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THE UNITED
STATES DESERVED WHAT HAPPENED.
BUT UNITED STATES POLICIES WERE AN ACCESSORY TO THE CRIME THAT DID HAPPEN."
>> Jon: WOW ABANDONING OUR VALUES AND PRINCIPLES SOMEHOW CAUSED POBS PROBLEMS FOR US AND
WE WEREN'T MINDING OUR BUSINESS AND THE GOT HIT?
WHAT KIND OF SCHEMING AMERICA-HATING EXTREMIST MONSTER WHO SAY SOMETHING SO PROFOUNDLY EVIL.
SMASH CUT TO GLENN BECK THREE MONTHS EARLIER.
>> I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION BEFORE 9/11.
NOW I'M PAYING ATTENTION.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY HATE US -- WELL.
DID WE DESERVE 9/11?
NO.
BUT WHERE WE MINDING OUR BUSINESS?
NO.
WERE WE IN BED WITH DICTATORS AND ABANDONED OUR VALUES AND PRINCIPLES?
YES.
THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WHAT WILL HE THINK TOMORROW THAT'S WHAT IS SO EXCITE BEING GOING TO GLENN BECK
UNIVERSITY WHAT BEGINS AS SPANISH CLASS COULD FINISH THE SEMESTER AS A MEXICAN BORDER SHOP PROJECT.
YOU DON'T KNOW.
THE REAL QUESTIONS ARE THIS:  DOES THIS IMAM RAUF HAVE TIES TO TERRORIST GROUPS, SHOULD WE MAKE
POLICY BASED ON THE PERCEIVED EMOTIONS OF VICTIMS OR PRACTICE PRACTITIONERS OF RELIGION AND
SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO REFER TO AN AREA AROUND AN OLD BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY AS HALLOWED GROUND.
BY THE WAY, GORE TEXT COLUMBIA SKI PARKA $98?
I FEEL LIKE I'M STEALING.
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS REAL JOURNALISTS ASK.
QUEUE REAL JOURNALISTS.
>> DID THE PRESIDENT SAY THE RIGHT THING?
WAS IT GOOD POLITICS.
>> WILL HIS COMMENTS HURT DEMOCRATS IN NOVEMBER?
>> WILL IT FOLLOW THE PARTY TO THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER?
>> THE REPUBLICANS PROBABLY SMELL A LITTLE BLOOD IN THE WATER HERE.
>> Jon: ASK RIGHT OR WRONG?
WHAT THE (bleep) IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
MISSED IT BY THIS MUCH.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR RELIGION CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONFUSING ME.
A REAL CONFUSING THING ABOUT THIS ISLAMIC COMMUNITY CENTER IS HOW EASILY PEOPLE ARE CONFLATING
AL QAEDA WITH ALL MUSLIMS.
LET ME SHOW WHAT YOU NEWT GINGRICH SAID THIS MORNING.
NAZIS DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO PUT UP A SIGN NEXT TO THE HOLOCAUST
MUSE YOU'LL IN -- MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: THAT IS HIM SAYING THE MUSLIMS TRYING TO BUILD A COMMUNITY CENTER IS EQUIVALENT
TO NAZIS.
>> THEY ARE SAYING ISLAM LIKE EVERY RELIGION HAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS BIGGEST (bleep).
THAT'S WHAT HE IS SAYING.
>>
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW THAT'S -- IF AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN
BOMBS AN ABORTION CLINIC WE DON'T HOLD ALL RESPONSIBLE?
>> OF COURSE WE DO.
WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE METAL DETECTORS AT STRYPER CONCERTS?
THINK ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO IT'S AN OLD REFERENCE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHY SHOULD RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAVE TO BEND TO PEOPLE'S
WORST SUSPICIONS ABOUT THEM.
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU CAN DO AND WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
YOU CAN BUILD A CATHOLIC CHURCH NEXT TO A PLAYGROUND.
SHOULD YOU DO THAT JON?
SHOULD YOU.
>> Jon: I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM.
>> I'M POSING THE QUESTION.
OR AM I ALONE IN THINKING IT'S A LITTLE TOO SOON FOR THAT?
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE THIS TIME OF YOUR PEOPLE.
JEWS CAN WEAR YAWK CAN AS ON GOOD FRIDAY -- YARMULKES ON GOOD FRIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE DAY YOU
SUCCESSFULLY MURDERED OUR LORD AND IS SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST.
IT'S YOUR RIGHT TO DO, THAT JON.
NO ONE WOULD BE SO INSENSITIVE AS TO ACTUALLY DO IT.
>> Jon: JEWS --
[LAUGHTER]
JEWS, ACTUALLY MANY DO WEAR THEIR YARMULKES ON GOOD FRIDAY.
>> SURE, THE RADICAL EXTREMISTS MIGHT, JON.
>> Jon: NO.
>> THE MODERATE PEACEFUL JEWS KNOW TO TONE IT DOWN ON SUCH A SENSITIVE OCCASION.
>> Jon: CAN WE WEAR THEM ON CHRISTMAS?
>> IT'S ONE DAY.
WE'RE ASKING YOU NOT TO WEAR THEM ONE DAY.
ONE DAY OF THE YEAR THE JEWS CANNOT WEAR THEIR MURDER CAPS.
>> Jon: THEY ARE NOT CALLED MURDER CAPS.
THEY ARE YARMULKES.
THEY ARE -- ONE DAY --
>> Jon: I FIND THIS OFFENSIVE.
THIS IS OFFENSIVE.
>> THAT'S THE THING, TOO PWA *D,
JON.
THIS IS AMERICA WHERE SPEECH,
UNLIKE RELIGION, IS COMPLETELY PROTECTED.
>> Jon: BUT PERHAPS IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS WAY.
FOR INSTANCE, F THESE RELIGIOUS ISSUES COULD BE QUALIFIED.
I'M JUST THINKING BACK TO THE REVOLUTION, THE BOSTON MASSACRE,
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.
DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY FOR TO YOU GO AROUND WITH A BRITISH ACCENT?
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE INSENSITIVE?
ISN'T THAT IN SOME WAYS -- FOR INSTANCE,, IS IT TOO SOON TO HAVE YOUR STUPID (bleep)
ACCENT IN MY -- WHAT I CONSIDER AND I THINK MANY AMERICANS CONSIDER.
MY HALLOWED EARS.
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,.
FIRST OF ALL, FIVE PEOPLE ISN'T A MASSACRE, JON.
IT'S BARELY A PLOWING ACCIDENT.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> PLEASE.
PLEASE.
SECOND OF ALL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
>> OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO (bleep) YOURSELF.
GO (bleep) YOURSELF!||||
