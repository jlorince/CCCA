GENERAL SHINSEKI ANYTHINGWOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ABOUT
THIS LATEST INSULT TO OURNATION'S VETERANS?
>> ANY ADVERSE INCIDENT LIKETHIS MAKES ME AS-- MAKES ME MAD
AS HELL.
I COULD USE STRONGER LANGUAGESURE, MR. CHAIRMAN.
BUT IN DEFERENCE TO THECOMMITTEE I WON'T.
>> NO I THINK THAT WOULD BEAN APPROPRIATE USE OF
STRONGER LANGUAGE.
PERHAPS I CAN OFFER YOUSOMETHING.
LET'S DIP INTO THE JAR ANDSEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.
MOTHER [BLEEP] [BLEEP].
>> YEAH MOTHER [BLEEP][BLEEP] DOES SEEM APPROPRIATE.
YOU KNOW, I THINK GENERALSHINSEKI, SINCE YOU'VE
HEADED UP THE VA SINCE 2009,FIVE YEARS INTO YOUR TENURE
MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO RACHETUP THE VOCABULARY OR
PERHAPS EVEN USE SOMENONVERBAL SIGNS
TO BETTER CONVEY THE ANGER YOUSAY YOU
FEEL BUT CAN'T USE APPARENTLYTO GET RESULTS. BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LOOK MAD.  FOR INSTANCE, ACAT MIGHT PIN HIS EARS BACK.
A HARP SEAL MIGHT RAISE UPON ITS, WHATEVER THAT THING
IS THAT IT'S RAISING UP ON.BUT A HUMAN, A HUMAN MIGHT
MOVE THEIR LIPS ORFACE. YOUR'S MAD AS HELL FACE
LOOKS A LOT LIKE YOUR OH WE'REOUT OF ORANGE JUICE FACE.
(LAUGHTER)MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE A PAGE
OUT OF AUSTRALIANDESCRIBING DOG INTERACTION GUY.
>> THEY CAME BOUNDING OVER --
>> NOW THAT GUY GETS THINGSDONE.
NOW OF COURSE. MOTHER [BLEEP][BLEEP] [BLEEP]
THERE'S APPARENTLY ALEAK.
NOW SHINSEKI IS ALSO THOUGH NOTTHE ONLY ONE WHO
IS VERY ANGRY.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS MADDERTHAN HELL AND I HAVE GOT THE
SCARS TO PROVE IT.
>> OH, YEAH, NO, I'M SURETHE STORY OF HOW YOU GOT
THOSE SCARS WILL REALLYIMPRESS THE GUYS WAITING AT
THE VA FOR TREATMENT.
OH, LOST A LEG THERE TO AN IEDIN FALLUJAH.
WELL, I GOT THIS WHEN SOMESPITTLE HIT ME IN THE EYEBROW
SO-- YEAH.
NOW OF COURSE THIS TYPE OFBUREAUCRATIC TRAUMA RUNS
DEEP. THE ANGER AND SADNESS GO
BACK YEARS LIKE TO2007 WHEN THE WALTER REED FILTHY
AND NEGLIGENT VA HOSPITALSCANDAL BROKE.
>> I WAS DISTURBED BY THEIRACCOUNTS.
>> I LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WASBOTH ANGERED AND
OFFENDED.
>> SO, I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENINGHERE.
THE DEPRESSION, THE IMPOTENTRAGE.
OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS ARECLEARLY SUFFERING FROM PBSD
POST BUREAUCRATIC STRESSDISORDER.
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEWHERETHEY COULD GET TREATMENT.
WELL, IT'D PROBABLY BE A LONGWAITING LIST.
IN FACT, WALTER REED WASSUCH A BIG PROBLEM OUR
PRESIDENT WAS ON IT BEFOREHE WAS EVEN PRESIDENT.
>> THEY COME HOME TO A NEWFRONT LINE OF RED TAPE AND
BUREAUCRACY.
AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
>> THIS IS JUST ONE MOREEXAMPLE OF OUR FAILURE TO
LIVE UP TO WHAT WE PROFESSTO HONOR AND THAT IS
MILITARY SERVICE.
AND I THINK THAT IT'S A GOODWAY, I THINK THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED BY IT.
>> YEAH, BUT THAT WAKE UP CALLWAS SEVEN YEARS AGO, BUT FOR
SOME REASON WE JUST KEEPHITTING THE [BLEEP]
SNOOZE BUTTON AND IT'S REALLY,HERE'S WHAT DISGUSTS ME.
SOMEHOW WE AS A COUNTRY WEREABLE TO SHIP 300,000 TROOPS
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD INJUST A FEW MONTHS TO FIGHT A
WAR THAT COST US $2 TRILLION,AN AMOUNT THAT DIDN'T COUNT
TOWARDS OUR DEFICIT BECAUSEWE PAID FOR IT SOMEHOW UNDER
THE TABLE.
YET FOR SOME REASON IT TAKESLONGER THAN THAT TO GET
SOMEONE HURT IN THAT WAR,NEEDED MEDICAL CARE OR
REIMBURSEMENT.
ALL WHILE WE PROFESS UNDYINGLOVE FOR THEIR SERVICE.
>> I WANT EVERY VETERAN TOKNOW THAT AMERICA WILL
ALWAYS HONOR YOUR SERVICE.
>> THEY SERVE AND SACRIFICE.
>> THE MOST HONORABLE MENAND WOMEN.
>> THE COURAGE ANDCOMMITMENT.
>> WE APPRECIATE YOU.
WE LOVE YOU.
>> THE BEST MILITARY IN THEWORLD.
>> WE HAVE THE FINESTMILITARY IN THE WORLD.
>> SO IT'S CLEAR LOVE ANDRESPECT AIN'T GETTING THE
JOB DONE SO THERE IS REALLYONLY ONE WAY TO PUT OUR
GOVERNMENT'S FULL RESOURCESBEHIND ANYTHING.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TOIMPROVE THE LIFE OF THESE
VETERANS, I'M AFRAID WE HAVETO DECLARE A WAR ON THEM.
(LAUGHTER)>> CONGRESS, WRITE A BLANK
CHECK TO FUND OPERATIONENDURING WAIT LIST, A WAR ON
ERROR.
BECAUSE IF YOU WANTAMERICANS TO FEEL SHOCK AND
AWE, YOU'LL FIX THIS [BLEEP]THING.
[BLEEP] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
