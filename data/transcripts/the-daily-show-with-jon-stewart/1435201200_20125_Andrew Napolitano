>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SENIOR,SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST FOR THE
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO OURPROGRAM JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO.
COME ON OUT HERE, YOUNG MAN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  I DIDN'T KNOW YOUWERE GOING TO RUN?
>> I'M ANXIOUS TO GET HERE.
>> Jon:  I'M DELIGHTED TOHAVE YOU.
PLEASE SIT, WE'LL TALK.
LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE WE HAD AWHOLE THING ABOUT CONFEDERACY
AND LINCOLN, IT WAS A BIG JOKE.
HA, HA, HA. HERE IT IS AGAIN.
>> THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE YOUHAD A BLACK WOMAN PLAYING
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND SHE WAS TWOFEET TALLER THAN I AM.
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOUSOMETHING?
>> SHE'S FABULOUS.
>> Jon:  SHE'S UNBELIEVABLEAND STILL TWO FEET TALLER THAN
YOU.
THAT WAS NOT DONE AS A GAG FORTHE SHOW.
>> I THINK WE'RE ABOUT THE SAMEHEIGHT, JON.
>> Jon:  YOU AND I ARE ABOUTTHE SAME HEIGHT, ALTHOUGHT NOW
YOU'RE MUCH FITTER THAN I.
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THISQUESTION.
YOU DEFEND PRINCIPLE.
YOU DON'T DEFEND POLITICS.
YOU DEFEND PRINCIPLE.
YOU SAY FLAG YES, NOT IN THESTATE HOUSE.
>> I SAY YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TOFLY THAT FLAG ON YOUR PRIVATE
PROPERTY.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ANYOPINION OR THOUGHT YOU WANT,
EVEN ONE MANIFESTED OR ANIMATEDBY HATE.
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOBUSINESS REGULATING THOUGHT.
IF THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTSANYTHING, IT PROTECTS YOUR
ABSOLUTE, UNFETTERED RIGHT TOTHINK WHAT YOU WANT AND SAY WHAT
YOU THINK. FOR PERSONS --
>> Jon:  OH, MY GOD, WAIT.
THAT WAS SO PERRY MASON.
THAT WAS-- HERE'S ONE OTHERTHING, HERE'S WHAT HE DID.
HE WENT, "AND I WOULD SAY THISIN THE DAYS AND THE WEEKS..."
BUT WHERE WERE YOU?
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
RIGHT ON THE NOISE.
>> Jon:  TREMENDOUS.
>> BUT THE SUPREME COURT DOESN'TGET THIS RIGHT.
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT,PEOPLED BY SOME FRIENDS OF MINE,
SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HASFREEDOM OF SPEECH.
>> Jon:  CORRECT.
>> WHO CARES WHAT THE GOVERNMENTTHINKS.
>> Jon:  THEY HAVE A RIGHT,THOUGH, TO FLY-- UNIVERSALLY
ACCEPTED THE UNITED STATES FLAG.
>> YES.
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAKWHEN IT'S NECESSARY FOR
GOVERNANCE, LIKE THE LIBRARY'SCLOSED, THE SPEED LIMIT IS 65
MILES PER HOUR.
BUT FOR THEM TO EXPRESS ANOPINION, TO SAY THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS THE FREEDOM OFSPEECH, IS VERY DANGEROUS.
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HASLIMITLESS, LIMITLESS RESOURCES
AND IT WILL DROWN OUT SPEECH ITHATES AND FEARS IF IT CAN DO SO.
AND THE RIGHT TO SPEAK IS ANATURAL, PERSONAL RIGHT.
IT'S NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANARTIFICIAL INSTITUTION LIKE THE
GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon:  BUT IT'S ALSO NOTTHE RIGHT TO SPEAK WITHOUT
CONSEQUENCE OR PUSH-BACK.
AND I'M NOTICING A TREND THATSAYS THAT I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
SAY WHATEVER I WANT AND YOUCAN'T CRITICIZE ME.
BECAUSE THAT'S-- THAT'STHREATENING AND INTIMIDATION BUT
IT'S NOT.
IT'S THE CONVERSATION.
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS.
THAT IS CALLED THE RIGHT NOT TOBE OFFENDED.
THERE IS NO SUCH RIGHT.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAYSOMETHING, PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CRITICIZE YOU ALL YOU WANT.
>> Jon:  CORRECT.
>> IF, IF I WERE GOING TO FLYTHE CONFEDERATE FLAG ON MY
PROPERTY, I SHOULD EXPECT A LOTOF CRITICISM.
>> Jon:  CORRECT.
>> THERE'S NO WAY TO KEEP THATCRITICISM AWAY, JUST LIKE
THERE'S NO WAY, MRS.  CLINTON,TO OUTLAW THE FLYING OF THAT
FLAG ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
>> Jon:  NOW YOU JUSTREFERRED TOME AS MRS. CLINTON.
AND, AGAIN, AND I SAY THIS WITHALL DUE RESPECT, YOU'VE KNOWN ME
FOR YEARS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  AND IT FELT ALITTLE BIT HURTFUL?
( LAUGHTER )
AND NOT REALLY ON A PAR WITHTHE TIME WE'VE SPENT.
>> YOU KNOW THIS IS MY --
>>Jon: NOW DOES SHE REALLY SAY,I WANT TO BAN IT ON PRIVATE
PROPERTY."
>> SHE SAID I WANT TO BAN THEFLAGS.
SHE DOESN'T WANT THEM SOLD, ANDSHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THEM.
THEY MAY-- TO SOME PEOPLETHEY REPRESENT A SYMBOL OF HATE.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
>> Jon:  LIKE AMERICANS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> YES.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO HATE,AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
EXPRESS YOUR HATRED.
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT ISTHE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLING OUR
THOUGHTS.
>> Jon:  I DON'T THINKTHERE'S ANY-- BUT I THINK THE
DIFFICULTY IS THE GOVERNMENTSELECTS, AND NOW WITH ALL THE
MEDIA CHANNELS AND MONEY BEINGSPEECH, THERE IS NOW MORE
PRESSURE THAN EVER AND I'MREALLY VERY INTERESTED IN THIS
NEW TREND OF IF SOMEBODY PUSHESBACK ON YOU, THAT'S P.C.
POLICING.
AND I FIND THAT SHOCKING,ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAY, "IT'S
ONLY FROM THE LEFT."
SMOTHERS BROTHERS GOT THROWN OFFTELEVISION.
NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO HAVE ATELEVISION SHOW.
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.
MY SIXTH TIME ON YOUR SHOW ANDI'M EXHILARATED.
>> Jon: YOU'RE EXHILARATED?
WHEN HAVE YOU NOT BEENEXHILARATED.
>> I COULD SLEEP LAST NIGHT, IWAS SO EXCITED ABOUT BEING HERE.
>> Jon:  WERE YOU THINKINGABOUT WHETHER A HOT DOG WAS A
SANDWICH?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'LL TELL YOU WHY I SAID THAT.
WE HAD A KID TODAY IN THEAUDIENCE, HE SAID TO ME --
>> I'M A VEGETARIAN!
>> Jon:  HE SAID TO MEBEFORE THE SHOW, I'M GETTING ALL
THESE QUESTIONS.
" THE ROLE OF SATIRE IN MODERNTIMES..."
"WHAT DO YOU THINK-- TELL MEABOUT A LEADER OF GREAT
EXPERTISE  AND ARTICULATION THATYOU MIGHT VOTE FOR."
KID SAID TO ME, "MY FRIEND AND IWERE HAVING AN ARGUMENT, IS A
HOT DOG A SANDWICH OR SOMETHINGCOMPLETELY DIFFERENT."
>> SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE SAIDTHAT?
>> Jon:  YES.
>> IS THAT PERSON HERE?
>> YES, RIGHT THERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  RIGHT THERE,SITTING RIGHT THERE.
>> SMARTEST KID IN THE CLASS.
>> Jon: THERE THEY ARE, RIGHTTHERE.
LET ME ASK YOU, NOW THATWE'RE HERE.
SANDWICH OR SOMETHING TOTALLYDIFFERENT?
>> TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
>> Jon:  THAT IS THEOPPOSITE.
ALL RIGHT, JUDGE--
>> YOU CAN'T PREDICTLIBERTARIANS.
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIEMS I WASHERE, I SAID I WAS GOING TO OUT
YOU.
>> Jon:  THAT'S SO FUNNY.
>> DON'T WE AGREE ON MORE THINGSTHAN WE DISAGREE ON.
>> Jon:  WE GENERALLY DO.
>> ON THE SIDE OF HUMAN FREEDOM.
>> Jon: AND WHEN WE DISAGREE, IALWAYS ENJOY THE SPIRIT IN WHICH
WE DO IT BECAUSE I RESPECT YOUAS AN INDIVIDUAL, AND THAT,
AGAIN, AS I SAY BEFORE, I DOFEEL YOU SPEAK NOT FROM CYNICISM
BUT FROM PRINCIPLE, DEEPLY HELD,OFTENTIMES WRONGLY.
BUT--
( LAUGHTER )
BUT DEEPLY, AND I RESPECT IT,AND I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED OUR
CONVERSATIONS AND I HAVE ALWAYSLEARNED.
>> IN MY PIECE, JON STEWART ANDME, I SAID THIS GUY JON STEWART,
SMARTEST PERSON ON TELEVISION.
>> Jon:  OH, STOP IT, YOU!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.
>> Jon:  WHAT DO WE GOT?
>> I WANT YOU TO RUN FOR THEUNITED STATES SENATE FROM NEW
JERSEY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  HERE'S THE THING.
I CAN COMMENT ON SOCIETY.
I CAN POKE FUN AT IT, BUT ITWOULD BE LIKE SAYING TO THE GUY
ON ESPN, TALKING ABOUT THE GREENBAY PACKERS, AARON ROGERS SHOULD
HAVE DONE THAT.
AND SAYING, "WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU SHOULD BE QUARTERBACK."
IT WOULD NOT WORK OUT.
>> AL FRANKEN IN THE SENATE.
JON STEWART IN THE SENATE.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT YOU'RESAYING.
IF I'M GETTING YOU CORRECTLY, WEREALLY SHOULD JUST FILL IT
WITH COMEDIANS.
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING.
JUST GIVE UP ANY PRETENSE THATTHIS IS A LEGISLATIVE BODY.
TURN THE WHOLE DAMN THING INTO"LAUGH-IN," HAVE JOE ANNE WORLEY
COME OUT OF THE THING -- COME ONBUDDY.
>> YOU.
>> Jon:  YES, SIR.
>> JOHNNY BOY.
>> Jon:  YES.
>> YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN MORE THANHALF THE SENATORS EVER KNEW.
>> Jon:  YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.
COME OBEAUTIFULLY DONE.
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO,EVERYBODY!
