>> Jon: OKAY.WELCOME BACK
SO WE'RE HERE, WE'RE TALKINGWITH FORMER SECRETARY OF
TREASURY TIMOTHY GEITHNER.
SO THIS GETS INTO OUR NEXTELEMENT WHICH IS THE PERCEPTION
AMONGST THE ENGINEERS OF THEBAILOUT THAT THEY ARE BEING
UNREASONABLY CASTIGATED.
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IT'SUNREASONABLE.
IT WAS DEEPLY UNFAIR.
THE RESCUE ITSELF AT ITS CORE ISA FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR THING,
EXCEPT -->> Jon: CORRECT.
-- EXCEPT RELATIVE TO THEALTERNATIVE OF LETTING THE
SYSTEM BURN DOWN.
>> Jon: THAT SEEMS LIKE AFALSE CHOICE.
>> IT'S NOT A FALSE CHOICE.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T BELIEVE THEBAILOUT COULD HAVE BEEN
ENGINEERED IN ANY OTHER WAY THANTHE ONE WE DID IT, OTHERWISE WE
HAVE A DEPRESSION.
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD.
IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT, EXCEPTTHERE'S BEEN A GREAT HISTORY OF
MISTAKES AND ERRORS OF COUNTRIESTRYING TO HAVE IT ALWAYS DO IT
DIFFERENTLY WHICH WOULD HAVEBEEN DRAMATICALLY MORE DAMAGING
FOR THEIR COUNTRIES.
THE IDEA THAT THIS COULD HAVEBEEN A MUCH STRONGER RECOVERY
AND LESS DAMAGING IS MOSTLY NOTABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE RESCUE.
BECAUSE THE RESCUE WAS VERYEFFECTIVE, IT DID THE ESSENTIAL
THING, MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE --
>> Jon: DIDN'T IT JUSTREINFLATE A TOXIC SYSTEM?
>> NO.
>> Jon: THE BANKING SYSTEM WASTOXIC, YES?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WE PUT A TREMENDOUSAMOUNT OF MONEY BACK INTO IT TO
MAKE THEM WHOLE WHILE KIND OFIGNORING THE HOME OWNER SECTION.
>> WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING TOTHAT BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVEON THAT
(LAUGHTER)IN EFFECT, WHAT HAPPENED --
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> WE LET THIS CRISIS, INSOME WAYS, BURN TOO HOT.
AND I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T FEELTHIS, DON'T SEE IT, BUT, IN
EFFECT, THE REASON WHY THIS WASSO SEVERE IS BECAUSE WE LET THAT
PANIC GET TO MOMEMTUM AND, INSOME WAYS, WE ALLOWED TOO MUCH
FAILURE AND CRUSHING FAILUREACROSS THE SYSTEM.
NOW, AFTER THE WE BROKE THEPANIC, WE DID FORCE THEM TO
RAISE A BUNCH OF CAPITAL, PAYBACK THE TAXPAYER, UNWIND ALL
THOSE PROGRAMS.
>> Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUTFORCING THEM, BECAUSE I THINK
THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY OFPHRASING IT BECAUSE WHAT WE DID
IS WE GAVE THEM THAT MONEY ANDTHEN WE OPENED UP A DISCOUNT
WINDOW GO TO AND BORROW AT0%, TURN AROUND AND BUY
TREASURIES AT 3% AND BASICALLYCREATE --
>> NOT QUITE.
LET ME SAY IT SLIGHTLYDIFFERENTLY.
>> Jon: OKAY(LAUGHTER)
>> WHAT WE DID -->> Jon: THEY GAVE US $100, AND
WE GAVE THEM $103.
>> LET ME SAY IT DIFFERENTLY.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> WE DID WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO INA PANIC, OKAY, WHICH IS WE, FOR
A PRICE, FOR A FEE -->> Jon: 5%.
>> WELL, SOMETIMES IT WASCHEAPER THAN THAT, SOMETIMES IT
WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT. WEGAVE THEM A SET OF PROTECTIONS
WHICH WE MADE THEM PAY FOR ANDWE MADE THEM PAY THE TAXPAYER
BACK. AND THE TAXPAYER EARNED APROFIT ON THOSE PROGRAMS
WHICH ARE GOING TO BE WORTH WELLTO $100 BILLION.
>> Jon: THAT SUGGESTS THEDAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY WAS MERELY
THE TAXPAYER IS ON THE HOOK -->> NO, IT'S TO SUGGEST THAT IF
PEOPLE PERCEIVE THIS TODAY STILLAS IF WE WENT AND GAVE THEM
MONEY THAT THEY WERE NEVER GOINGTO SEE AGAIN THAT WE DIDN'T NEED
TO DO.
>> Jon: I HONESTLY HAVE NOIDEA HOW WE EDIT THIS.
SO I AM GOING TO SAY, LIKE, TIMGEITHNER, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
(APPLAUSE)THERE IS SO MUCH ON THE WEB
RIGHT NOW ON THIS, I DON'T KNOWIF WE BROKE THE WEB OR NOT, BUT
THE THE BOOK IS CALLED "STRESSTEST."
TIMOTNY GEITHNER WROTE IT, WASTHE SECRETARY OF TREASURY.
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING READ.
I ACTUALLY SAY THIS, IT'S AREALLY WELL-WRITTEN BOOK AND
EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU CANYELL AT CERTAIN PAGES, IF YOU
WANT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
STOPPING BY AND SPENDING ANINORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH
US.
TIMOTNY GEITHNER, THANK YOU FORBEING HERE.
