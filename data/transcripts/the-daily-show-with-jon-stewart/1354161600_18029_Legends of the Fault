>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, MAN.
WE'RE NOT MESSING AROUND.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NOTED -- (AUDIENCE YELLS SOMETHING) I'M SORRY?
I HOPE THAT WAS NOT AN ANTI-SEMITIC SLUR.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT -- (LAUGHS) IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY SO -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WISHES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR THE KIND BIRTHDAY WISHES, AGAIN, THANK YOU.
VERY KIND.
BUT LET'S GET TO OUR SHOW!
THE NOTED AUTHOR AND INVENTOR NEIL YOUNG IS GOING TO BE JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ATTACKS ON THE U.S. CONSULATE IN
BENGHAZI, LIBYA.
IT WAS A TRAGIC SITUATION WHERE AMERICAN LIVES WERE LOST AND IN THE THREE MONTHS SINCE THE
ATTACK, LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS OF ADEQUATE EMBASSY SECURITY, AMERICAS OVERALL ADVOCACY IN
FIGHTING THE WAR ON TERROR AND THE INTRICATE DANCE BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY CONFIDENTIALITY AND THE PUBLIC'S
RIGHT TO KNOW HAVE ALL BEEN DISTILLED DOWN, THROWN OUT AND REPLACED WITH THIS ONE URGENT
CONCLUSION CONCERNING CURRENT U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS SUSAN RICE.
>> I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO BLACK HER FROM BEING THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE.
SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED.
>> Jon: THAT'S SENATOR JOHN McCAIN CONTINUING HIS SEVEN YEAR QUEST TO NEGATE EVERY GOOD
THING HE'D EVER DONE PRIOR TO THAT.
(LAUGHTER) THIS TIME LEADING THE CHARGE TO PREEMPT AS AN OF NOW HYPOTHETICAL OBAMA NOMINATION
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE TO REPLACE HILLARY CLINTON.
WHY?
BECAUSE FIVE DAYS AFTER THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS, SUSAN RICE WENT ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS
AND SAID THIS: .
>> THE BEST ASSESSMENT WE HAVE TODAY IS THAT IN FACT THIS WAS NOT A PREPLANNED, PREMEDITATED ATTACK.
THAT WHAT HAPPENED INITIALLY WAS A SPONTANEOUS REACTION TO WHAT HAD JUST TRANSPIRED IN CAIRO AS
A CONSEQUENCE OF THE VIDEO.
>> Jon: (WHIT PERKING) WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WRONG NOW.
AND WE NOW KNOW MANY IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT THAT STATEMENT
WAS WRONG.
THAT THE ATTACKERS WERE NOT ANGRY FILM CRITICS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT AL QAEDA OR ONE OF AL QAEDA'S ABLE A. TEAMS, THE ANSAR AL-SHARIA MUD HENS.
(LAUGHTER) SO SUSAN RICE MET YESTERDAY WITH SENATORS McCAIN, GRAHAM AND AYOTTE TO CLEAR THE AIR.
HOW DID THAT GO?
>> AMBASSADOR RICE I THINK DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE REALITY AT THE TIME AND IN HINDSIGHT
CLEARLY WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.
>> WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY TROUBLED BY MANY OF THE ANSWERS THAT WE GOT AND SOME THAT WE DIDN'T GET
CONCERNING EVIDENCE THAT WAS OVERWHELMING LEADING UP TO THE ATTACK ON OUR CONSULATE.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE DEAL: THEY MAY BE RIGHT.
THOUGH ON THE SCALE OF PUBLIC MISSTATEMENTS, RICE'S COMMENTS SEEM TO FALL MORE FOR THE
EMBARRASSING EVIDENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL DISORGANIZATION END OF THE SCALE.
(LAUGHTER) BUT HERE'S THE THING: THESE TWO DON'T GET TO BE THE ONES WHO SELF-RIGHTEOUSLY GET ANGRY ABOUT THIS.
THEY'RE UPSET SHE MAY HAVE PASSED BAD INTEL, WITTINGLY OR UNWITTINGLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
REMEMBER THESE TWO FROM A DECADE AGO?
>> SADDAM HUSSEIN CONTINUES TO ACQUIRE, AMASS, AND IMPROVE ON HIS ARSENAL OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
HE CONTINUES TO ACQUIRE -- ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
THESE ARE ALL WELL-KNOWN FACTS.
>> LET'S ACT NOW TO GET RID OF A TYRANT WHO'S ABUSED AND KILLED HIS OWN PEOPLE, WHO'S PROCURING
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT.
>> Jon: I REMEMBER ALL THAT FROM THEIR HIT BLOG (BLEEP) OLD GUYS WHO UNNECESSARILY GET US
INTO WARS SAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, IT'S PROBABLY NOT A ONE-TO-ONE COMPARISON.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S NOT A ONE-TO-ONE COMPARISON.
BECAUSE WHILE SUSAN RICE ADMITTED TO THE ERROR WITHIN WEEKS, THESE TWO STILL REFUSE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INVADING A COUNTRY BASED ON INFORMATION FROM A SOURCE NAMED "CURVEBALL"
WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED PRETTY (BLEEP)ING IDEA BY MANY AT THE TIME.
IF ONLY WE HAD A MORE DIRECT COMPARISON TO MAKE HERE.
SORT OF A ONE-TO-ONE.
LIKE ANOTHER HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL PASSING WHAT THEY KNEW AT THE TIME WAS
MISLEADING INTELLIGENCE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ON A SUNDAY NEWS SHOW.
ALSO IN LINE TO BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE AND WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND A WOMAN AND, LET'S
SAY HER NAME WAS ALSO RICE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING!
>> WE DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SHIPMENTS GOING INTO IRAN, FOR INSTANCE -- INTO IRAQ FOR
INSTANCE OF ALUMINUM TUBES THAT REALLY ARE ONLY SUITED TO HIGH -- HIGH QUALITY ALUMINUM TUBES
THAT ARE ONLY SUITED FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS, CENTRIFUGE PROGRAMS.
>> Jon: SHE KNEW THAT WAS BULL (BLEEP) AT THE TIME.
WHAT WOULD A JOHN McCAIN OR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAY ABOUT A WOMAN LIKE THAT'S QUALIFICATIONS FOR
SECRETARY OF STATE?
>> TO ATTACK HER PERSONALLY IS WAY OVER THE LINE BECAUSE SHE IS OUR FACE AND VOICE TO THE WORLD
AND YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY AMERICAN ANY GOOD BY SENDING HER OFF WITH SUCH LABELS.
>> BUT I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CONDOLEEZZA RICE IS A PERSON OF INTEGRITY.
AND YES, I SEE THIS -- SOME LINGERING BITTERNESS OVER A VERY TOUGH CAMPAIGN.
I HOPE IT DISSIPATES SOON.
>> Jon: OH, I'M SURE IT WILL.
WHAT KIND OF CROTCHETY "GRAND TORINOISH" OLD (BLEEP) WOULD BE ABLE TO GET
