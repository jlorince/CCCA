[ LAUGHTER ]VLADMIR PUTIN SEEMS POISED TO
ABSORB UKRAINE'S ENTIRE RUSSIANPOPULATION.
BUT WHO'S IS TO SAY HE'LL STOPTHERE. OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE
INVESTIGATES RUSSIA'S NEXTPOSSIBLE STOP.
>> VLADMIR PUTIN ANNEXTATIONOF CRIMEA SHOCKED THE WORLD AND
FOREIGN POLICY NERDS LIKE ANDREWWEISS ARE CONCERNED THAT RUSSIA
WILL CONTINUE TO ILLEGALLYEXPAND ITS BORDERS.
>> WE'VE BASICALLY SEEN ONLYTHE BEGINNING OF RUSSIA'S MUSCLE
MOVEMENTS HERE. RUSSIA HAS ALOT OF ARROWS IN THE QUIVER.
IT'S QUITE SCARY.
>> WHO IS IT MOST SCARY FOR?
>> THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE SCAREDARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD. KAZAKHSTANAND THE CAUCUSES.
THEY HAVE LARGE ETHNIC RUSSIANPOPULATIONS..
>> OK I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OFTHOSE COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY ARE
KIND OF LIKE THE SAME TO ME.
WHAT ABOUT OUR COUNTRY?
SHOULD WE BE AFRAID?
>> I THINK THE MOST TROUBLINGPART IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PUTIN
WANTS. HE SAYS "I'MDEFENDING ETHNIC RUSSIANS."
THEY COULD BE ANY ANYWHERE.
>> WHAT I'M HEARING IS IT COULDHAPPEN HERE.
>> NO WAY.
>> OK, YOU DON'T THINK IT'SPOSSIBLE? GIVE ME SOME ODDS.
>> I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUTASTROID HITTING THE EARTH ODDS.
SO ONE IN A COUPLE TRILLION.
>> SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS, ITCOULD HAPPEN HERE.
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
>> OK, YOU ALREADY GAVE ME THEODDS.
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.
TOO LATE, GO TO THE PACKAGE.
>> IT COULD HAPPEN HERE.
>> SO I HEADED TO WHERE PUTINIS MOST LIKELY TO INVADE NEXT, A
FAR AWAY PLACE WHERE RUSSIANLANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS DOMINATE
THE LOCAL CULTURE.
A TERRIFIED NEIGHBORHOOD CALLEDBRIGHTON BEACH BROOKLYN,
AMERICA.
SKEPTICAL?
WELL, THEN LET'S EXAMINE THEPARALLELS BETWEEN CRIMEA AND
BRIGHTON BEACH.
WHY WAS CRIMEA RIPE FOR THEPICKING?
>> THE MAIN ISSUES WAS THEPEOPLE OF CRIMEA DON'T LIKE LIKE
THE PEOPLE OF THE RESTUKRAINE. A LOT OF THEM BASICALLY
SEE THEMSELVES AS EX-SOVIET ORRUSSIANS CULTURALLY.
>> OKAY.
SO LET'S SEE IF THE PEOPLE OFBRIGHTON BEACH ARE TRULY
RUSSIAN.
CREEPY SOVIET VIBE, CHECK.
RUSSIAN STYLE LEISURE.
IS THIS YOUR VERSION OFSUNBATHING? CHECK.
TRADITIONAL RUSSIAN ATTIRE?
OF COURSE.
STRONG SENSE OF RUSSIANNESS?
>> SHOW OF HANDS, WHO HERECONSIDERS THEMSELVES TO BE
ETHNICALLY RUSSIAN.
OH, MY OKAY.
DRIPPING WET BALLS.
I'M AFRAID SO.
BUT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE THATUNIQUELY RUSSIAN JE NE SAIS
QUOI?
GIVE ME YOUR BEST AND MOSTBEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN SMILE.
[ LAUGHTER ]SHOW ME YOUR BIGGEST, BRIGHTEST
RUSSIAN SMILE. LIFT THE CORNERSOF YOUR MOUTH.
JUST LIFT THE CORNERS OF YOURMOUTH INTO A SMILE.
[ LAUGHTER ]I DARE YOU TO (bleep) LOOK AT
THIS VIDEO AND NOT SMILE.
UGH WHAT KIND OF MONSTER AREYOU?
NOTHING COULD MAKE THESE PEOPLESMILE.
SHOW ME THE SMILE ON YOUR FACEWHEN YOU FIRST FOUND OUT THAT
PUTIN ILLEGALLY ANNEXED CRIMEA.
OH, THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS.
I KNEW IT.
>> EXCEPT FOR THAT.
WE'RE SO GETTING INVADED.
>> OK I WAS JUST IN BRIGHTONBEACH.
AND IT CAN HAPPEN HERE IT COULDHAPPEN HERE. NO CUT THAT (bleep)
OUT. SERIOUSLY IT COULD HAPPENHERE.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TOHAPPEN HERE.
PUTIN KEEPS SAYING THAT PEOPLEIN UKRAINE ARE UNDER THE THREAT
OF NEO-NAZI MOBS HUNTINGDOWN ETHIC RUSSIANS.
AND THAT CREATED A PREDICATE FORMILITARY ACTION IN CRIMEA.
>> CRIMEA HAS MARAUDING GROUPSOF GUYS SCARING LOCAL RUSSIANS
BUT THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHINGLIKE THAT IN BRIGHTON BEACH.
>> ALL WINTER, ALL WINTER
THEY SITTING HERE.
>> WHO? >> THE GUYS.
>> THEY COME AND PEOPLE
THEY DRINK VODKA HERE. THISIS NO GOOD.
>> VODKA, VODKA AND THENGOING PEE PEE.
>> THEY DOING THE VODKA.THEY'RE GOING PEE PEEEVERYWHERE.
>> THEY FIGHT. YEAH.  PEE PEE INTHE ROAD.
>> ALL OVER THE PLACE.
>> (bleep) IT IS HAPPENINGHERE.
>> IT'S NOT HAPPENING HERE.
PUTIN IS NOT MOVING INTOBROOKLYN.
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.
AND THEN THEY COME FOR YOU INTHEIR GODDAMN NEON SPEEDOS.
LEAVING ME ONLY ONE CHOICE: CONDITION MY BODY, LEARN THEIR
CUSTOMS.
YOUR BEARD HAIR IS TICKLING ME ALITTLE BIT.
[LAUGHTER]AND DO MY BEST TO BLEND IN
HOPING THAT WHEN MY NEWOVERLORDS ARRIVE I'LL BE ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: SAM BEE.
