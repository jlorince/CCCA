>> Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW.
SO LISTEN, I HAD A NICE CONVERSATION WITH HERMAN CAIN ON THE SHOW AND THEN WE HAD ANOTHER
ONE THAT WENT TO THE WEB.
YOU KNOW I NORMALLY DON'T ASK YOU TO WATCH THE INTERVIEWS ON THE WEB.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE INTERNET,
QUITE FRANKLY.
I'M AFRAID OF IT.
BUT THIS TIME I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH IT.
DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD WATCH IT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH THIS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT, I DON'T KNOW, DIALUP, WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU SHOULD GET ON THE WEB.
HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
>> ATTENTION, READY TO ROLL?
WE'RE ROLLING.
