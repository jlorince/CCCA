INTERVIEW UP.
BECAUSE I'M SURE I DID.
YESTERDAY WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT JOHN McCAIN RECENTLY
RELEASED MEDICAL RECORDS,
1200 PAGES COVERING ALL THE
DISEASES HE'S HAD IN THE
LAST EIGHT YEARS FROM A TO Z,
FROM ACCUSE -- ACUTE OLDNESS
TO ZABAR'S ELBOW.
THAT IS A REPETITIVE MOTION
INJURY CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE
SHMEARING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT IS SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK YOUR
JEWISH FRIENDS WHO LIVE
BETWEEN 709 AND LET'S SAY
90TH STREET ON THE WEST SIDE
OF MANHATTAN.
NARROW JOKE.
FAIR IS FAIR, BARACK OBAMA
RELEASED HIS MEDICAL RECORDS
ENTAILING THE LAST 21 YEAR,
AND THIS IS THEM, I KID YOU
NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: A ONE-PAGE LETTER
FROM OBAMA'S DOCTOR STATING
THAT THE SENATOR -- AND IT
IS TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,
IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND
CONTINUING QUOTE ON PHYSICAL
COMPASSION HIS BLOOD
PRESSURE WAS 90 OVER 60,
PULSE 60 BEATS PER MINUTE,
HIS BUILD WAS LEAN AND
MUSCULAR WITH NO EXCESS BODY
FAT.
HIS CHEST WAS SMOOTH AND
HARD LIKE THE HOOD OF A --
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LOOK THE HOOD OF A
MUSTANG.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AS I WATCHED THE
DEWY BEADS OF MOISTURE
GLISTEN ON HIS CORRUGATED
STOMACH I WAS THANKFUL THIS
WAS MY LAST APPOINTMENT OF
THE DAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WITH TREMBLING HANDS
I HELD UP HIS URINE SAMPLE
TO THE LIGHT.
THERE WAS SEDIMENTATION.
ANYWAY, IT ENDS THERE.
MY POINT IS -- COME ON.
WHAT IS HE, ACHILLES, FOR
GOD'S SAKE
