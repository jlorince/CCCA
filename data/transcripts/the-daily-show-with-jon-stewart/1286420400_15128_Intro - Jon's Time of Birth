>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
AUTHOR PHILIP DRAY IS ON THE
SHOW TONIGHT.
HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK
"THERE IS POWER IN A UNION."
IT'S ABOUT THE LABOR UNION IN
THE AMERICA.
HOPEFULLY WE'RE FINISHED BY
11:27 OR WE PAY HIM TIME AND A
HALF.
I HAD THE GREAT ET CETERA
QUESTION I'VE EVER HAD IN THE
AUDIENCE TODAY.
A GENTLEMAN STOOD UP VERY
QUIETLY AND SAID, "WHAT TIME
WERE YOU BORN?"
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR
MOTHER'S VAGINA HAD A CLOCK IN
IT...
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I WAS BORN IN THE EARLY
'60s.
BACK THEN IT WAS JUST SUNDIALS.
