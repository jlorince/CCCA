>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT, MY GUESTTONIGHT, A YOUNG MAN NAMED
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN-- (CHEERS, AUDIENCE SAYS "BRUCE"!)
YOU HEAR WHAT THEY'RE DOINGRIGHTS THERE?
THEY'RE NOT SAYING BRUCE,THEY'RE SAYING FRANK CARUSO,
WHO IS THE OTHER GENTLEMANWHO IS HERE TONIGHT.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKINGABOUT THEIR NEW BOOK "OUTLAW
PETE"BUT FIRST, I HAVE
UNBELIEVABLY EXCITING NEWS.
GENTLEMEN WHO ARE WEARINGSAILOR SUITS, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LOOK FOR THE NEARESTNURSE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
THE WAR ON ISIS MAY BETURNING FOR THE ALLIED
POWERS.
>> ISIS LEADER ABU BAKR ALBAGHDADI POSSIBLY KILLED IN
THE LATEST U.S.-LED AIRSTRIKES IN IRAQ.
>> Jon: BOOM!
LITERALLY.
(LAUGHTER)LOOKS LIKE OBAMA IS GOING TO
HAVE TO BREAK OUT A NEW IJUST KILLED BAGHDADI HALLWAY
WALK.
MIGHT I RECOGNIZE SOMETHINGA LITTLE MORE PSYCHEDELIC, A
LITTLE MORE-- WILLY WONKA.
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS.
THE LEADER OF ISIS IS DEAD>> IRAQI OFFICIALS ARE
SAYING AL BAGHDADI WASCRITICALLY WOUNDED IN AN AIR
STRIKE THIS WEEKEND.
>> Jon: OR WOUNDED.
HE'S DEAD OR WOUNDED.
NOT QUITE DEAD, BUT THAT'SNOT NOTHING.
HE'S NOT IN HELL YET, BUT HEIS ON THE HIGHWAY TO HELL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.
LET'S GET SOME INFORMATION.
WHERE DID WE NAIL HIM?
WHERE DID WE NAIL HIM?
>> ACCORDING TO THE U.S., ANAIR STRIKE WAS CONDUCTED
TARGETING AN ISIS CONVOYOUTSIDE OF MOSUL.
>> AN INTERIOR MINISTRYINTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL CLAIMS
THE STRIKE IN THE TOWN OFQAIM.
>> Jon: THE IMPORTANT THINGIS THOUGH WE KILLED OR
CRITICALLY INJURED BAGHDADISOMEWHERE IN THAT AREA.
>> IT'S STILL A BIG MYSTERYTO U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIALS
WHETHER THE LEADER OF ISISABU BAKR AL BAGHDADI WAS
ACTUALLY IN A CONVOY THATWAS STRUCK SATURDAY NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: HOW FITTING.
(LAUGHTER)THAT THE UNITED STATES IN A
BOMBING RAID SOMEWHEREAROUND QAIM OR MOSUL HAS
KILLED OR INJURED THE LEADEROF ISIS OR SOME OTHER
[BLEEP] GUY.
WHO WAS MAYBE JUST TRYING TOBEAT THE RUSH-HOUR TRAFFIC
BETWEEN MOSUL AND QAIM ANDHAD AN OLD ISIS SHIRT
STUFFED WITH NEWSPAPERS SOHE COULD USE THE H-O-V LANE.
NOT EXACTLY FRONT PAGE NEWS.
MORE OF A MILITARY BLINDITEM.
HOW DID THIS STORY GET SOMURKY?
>> TURNS OUT IT WAS A TWEETTHAT SET OFF RUMORS OF
BAGHDADI'S INJURIES.
>> THIS TWEET, ORIGINALTWEET WAS ALLEGEDLY FROM THE
ISIL SPOKESMAN, HOWEVER THATWAS VERY QUICKLY DENIED BY
OTHER ISIL SOURCES WHO SAIDTHAT THIS TWITTER ACCOUNT
WAS RUN BY JORDANIANINTELLIGENCE.
>> Jon: GREAT, NO, SO WETHINK WE KILLED BAGHDADI
BECAUSE JORDANIANINTELLIGENCE IS CATFISHING
ISIS, THAT'S JUST GREAT.
SO FOR THE FORESEEABLEFUTURE, WE HAVE TO ASSUME
BAGHDADI IS BOTH DEAD ANDNOT DEAD.
THE PARADOX KNOWN ASSCHRODINGER'S TERRORISTS.
LOOK, HOPEFULLY THIS WILLDISCOURAGE PEOPLE THOUGH NOW
FROM JOINING ISIS.
>> FOREIGNERS LOOKING TOJOIN ISIS AND OTHER MILITANT
GROUPSÃ‘i ARE NOW TRAVELING BYCRUISE SHIP TO AVOID AIRPORT
SECURITY (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WE ARE TRULY SCREWED.
BECAUSE IF THESE PEOPLE ARESO COMMITTED TO JIHAD THAT
THEY ARE WILLING TO RISKEVERYTHING, INCLUDING GOING
ON A CRUISE SHIP.
(LAUGHTER)AND BECOMING INMATES ON A
FLOATING POOP PRISON,INTERESTING CHOICE, THE
CRUISE SHIP.
I MEAN THERE'S OBVIOUSLYDOWNSIDES, THE PATH TO JIHAD
IS GONNA BE LONGER.
YOU HAVE ALL THOSE STOPS,VARIOUS PORTS OF CALL.
YOU HAVE TO BALANCE YOURHATRED OF INFIDELS WITH THE
LURE OF DUTY FREE.
AND WHEN YOU FINALLY REACHTHE TERROR CAMP, THERE WILL
BE NO HIDING THOSE GLORIOUSEIGHT DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS.
(LAUGHTER)WE CAN'T TRUST TERRORISTS TO
STAY DEAD, WE CAN'T TRUST CRUISESHIPS IS THERE ANYTHING WE
CAN TRUST IN THIS FIGHT.
>> I WANT THE AMERICANPEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW
THIS EFFORT WILL BEDIFFERENT FROM THE WARS IN
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
IT WILL NOT INVOLVE AMERICANCOMBAT TROOPS FIGHTING ON
FOREIGN SOIL.
>> Jon: YEAH.
IF AMERICAN TROOPS ARE GOING TOBE FIGHTING.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIGHTINGON OUR SOIL AGAINST--
(LAUGHTER)WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT IS COMFORTING TO HEAR OURPRESIDENT SAY ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION THERE WILL BE NOCOMBAT TROOPS IN IRAQ.
>> TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMAAUTHORIZED THE DEPLOYMENT OF
1500 MORE U.S. TROOPS TOIRAQ TO HELP IN THE FIGHT
AGAINST ISIS.
>> WITH THIS EXPANSION, THENUMBER AUTHORIZED HAS GROWN
FROM 275 IN JUNE TO 3100TONIGHT.
>> Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP].
YOU SAID NO TROOPS-- AND INFIVE MONTHS WE'VE INCREASED
U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ BY TENTIMES.
AT THAT RATE, BY 2016,EVERYONE ON EARTH WILL BE IN
IRAQ FIGHTING ISIS
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TORECRUIT PEOPLE FROM ISIS TO
FIGHT ISIS.
>> AND THOSE TROOPS AREBOOTS ON THE GROUND.
YOU SAID NO BOOTS ON THEGROUND.
THE GROUND WOULD GET NOBOOTS!
>> THE AMERICAN FORCES THATHAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO IRAQ
DO NOT AND WILL NOT HAVE ACOMBAT MISSION.
THEIR MISSION IS TO ADVISEAND ASSIST OUR PARTNERS ON
THE GROUND.
>> Jon: OH, I'M SORRY, THATWAS MY MISTAKE.
I'M SORRY.
SO IT'S NOT 3,000 TROOPS,IT'S 3,000 ADVISORS.
OKAY.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOTOF ADVICE.
(LAUGHTER)I FEEL LIKE AFTER THE FIRST
2,000 GIVE THEIR INPUT, IT'SMOSTLY GOING TO BE LIKE "YOU
KNOW, I JUST WANT TO REITERATEWHAT TONY SAID."
YOU KNOW, MAYBE, MAYBE THEPENTAGON CAN SPIN THIS A BIT
BETTER.
>> LESS THAN HALF OF THEMWILL BE DEDICATED TO THE
ADVISE AND ASSIST MISSION.
AND OF THAT NUMBER, AND IT'SAROUND 630 OR SO, IT IS
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT AGOOD CHUNK OF THAT WILL BE
ENABLERS FOR THE ADVISORS,LOGISTICS, COMMAND AND
CONTROL, INTELLIGENCESUPPORT FOR THEM.
>> Jon: OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
SO HALF OF THE TROOPS AREADVISORS.
AND HALF OF THAT HALF AREGOING TO BE ADVISOR
ENABLERS.
WHICH I GUESS IS STANDINGBEHIND THE ADVISORS GOING, I
DON'T KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKEGOOD ADVICE TO ME.
(LAUGHTER)I WOULD LISTEN TO THAT
ADVICE IF I WAS-- OBVIOUSLYI'M NOT GIVING THE ADVICE.
I'M JUST A GENTLEMAN BEHINDHIM.
I BELIEVE THIS IS ALLSOUNDING A LITTLE [BLEEP].
GOT ANYTHING [BLEEP]-ER?
>> THE REMAINDER OF THENUMBER WHICH IS, I GUESS,
ABOUT 870, SOMETHING LIKETHAT, THEY WILL BE DEDICATED
TO THIS BUILDING PARTNERCAPACITY MISSION, TO THE
HANDS-ON TRAINING.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THE MOREOUT OF YOUR WAY YOU GO TO
CALL THESE NOT BOOTS ON THEGROUND, THE MORE WE'RE GOING
TO THINK THESE ARE BOOTS ON THEGROUND
SO NOW WE'RE GOING HAVE3,000 TROOPS IN IRAQ AGAIN.
CAN WE AT LEAST AGREE TOSTOP IT RIGHT THERE BEFORE
WE GET STUCK ALL THE WAYBACK INTO THE QUAGMIRE?
>> SHOULD WE EXPECT THATMORE TROOPS MAY BE NEEDED
BEFORE THIS IS OVER?
>> YOU KNOW, AS COMMANDER INCHIEF, I'M NEVER GOING TO SAY
NEVER.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT THATSOUNDS LIKE TO ME, SUIT UP
OLD MAN!
(LAUGHTER)THERE'S A PARTNER CAPACITY
BUILDING MISSION IN FALLUJAHWE NEED YOUR ADVICE ON.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
