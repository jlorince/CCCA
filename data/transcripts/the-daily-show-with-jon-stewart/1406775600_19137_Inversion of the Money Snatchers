>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, AN OLDFAVORITE, MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL IS
GOING TO BE HERE DISCUSSING HERNEW MINISERIES, "THE HONOURABLE
WOMAN," ABOUT ONE PERSON'SATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THE GAP
BETWEEN -- OH, FOR GOD'S...
ISRAEL AND PALESTINE?
OH, MAN, CAN A BROTHER GATEBATMAN SEQUEL?
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
[LAUGHTER]I JUST, I JUST NEED A DAY OFF.
THAT'S ALL I NEED.
AND THE AUDIENCE WANTS ME TOSOLVE IT. AND THE [MUMBLING]...
WHAT DO YOU, WOULD YOU DO?
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST [BLEEPED]SAID THAT.
I JUST WANTED SOME PIZZA.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
[LAUGHTER]BUT TONIGHT I'D LIKE THE TALK TO
YOU ABOUT CORPORATIONS.
CORPORATIONS, THEY'RE A LOT LIKEUS -- IMMORTAL.
[LAUGHTER]SHIELDED FROM LIABILITY,
ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TOSHAREHOLDERS.
OH, WAIT, THAT'S OPPOSITE OF US.
SORRY.
BUT THERE IS ONE THINGCORPORATIONS DO HAVE IN COMMON
WITH THE REST OF US.
THEY DON'T LIKE PAYING TAXES.
HATE IT.
FORTUNATELY, THEY RARELY HAVETO.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S --OH, THAT'S NOT, NO.
THAT'S... I DON'T. I DON'T... IDID NOT...
I DID NOT APPROVE THIS, AND IFEEL THAT THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL
IN SOME WAYS.
IT'S ABOUT INVESTIGATING...OKAY.
THAT I DON'T... THAT I DON'T.
LET'S GO WITH THE FIRST ONE, ANDTHEN WE'LL JUST... OKAY.
THAT'S FINE.
[LAUGHTER]ANYWAY, THIS SEASON'S HOT NEW
TAX LOOPHOLE FOR CORPORATIONS, AONCE-OBSCURE TAX DODGE KNOWN AS
THE CORPORATE INVERSION, WHICHSOUNDS LIKE THE BUSINESS
EQUIVALENT OF GENDERREASSIGNMENT, AND IT KIND OF IS.
IT'S A LIBERATING PROCEDURE FORCOMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED
AMERICAN BUT KNOW IN THEIRHEARTS THEY'RE REALLY IRISH.
>> TAX INVERSIONS, THAT'S WHERECOMPANIES REINCORPORATE OVERSEAS
SIMPLY TO CUT THEIR U.S. TAXBILLS.
>> ACCOMPANIED BY THE FOREIGNSUBSIDIARY AND THEN
THROUGH THE MAGIC OF PAPERWORKPROCLAIMS ITSELF TO BE A FOREIGN
COMPANY AND OWNED BY THESUBSIDIARY.
>> AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY,YOU'RE AN AMERICAN COMPANY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE ANIRISH COMPANY.
>> Jon: OH SO IT'S LIKE ST.PATRICK'S DAY FOR CORPORATIONS.
[LAUGHTER]EXCEPT INSTEAD OF BEER, THEY
VOMIT PROFIT.
CORPORATE INVERSION IS A WIN-WINFOR EVERYONE.
AND BY "EVERYONE," I MEAN ONLYTHE CORPORATIONS AND THEIR
SHAREHOLDERS.
CONGRESS ESTIMATES THATINVERSIONS WILL COST THE
TREASURY $19.5 BILLION OVER TENYEARS, BUT FORTUNE MAGAZINE
BELIEVES THAT THAT ESTIMATE ISWAY LOW BECAUSE "FORTUNE"
MAGAZINE IS A COMMUNIST RAG.
[LAUGHTER]HOW DO WE STOP INVERSION?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SUPPORTANTI-INVERSION LEGISLATION.
THE LEGISLATION WOULD MANDATETHAT COMPANIES MUST BE MORE THAN
50% OWNED BY A FOREIGN ENTITY TOESCAPE U.S. TAXES.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT SOUNDSREASONABLE, AND IF PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS BACKING THAT LAW, IT'SPROBABLY A DONE DEAL.
[LAUGHTER]JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, THOUGH,
FOR GIGGLES HERE, WHERE DOES THEREPUBLICAN PARTY STAND?
>> WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CORPORATETAX RATE IN THE WORLD.
>> OUR TAX CODE, WHICH IS WHAT'SCAUSING A LOT OF THESE
INVERSIONS...
>> IN A WAY THESE COMPANIES AREECONOMIC REFUGEES.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: OH, WELL IF THEY'RE
REFUGEES, WHY DON'T WE JUSTSTICK TO OUR NORMAL POLICY AND
SEND THEM BACK TO WHERE THEYCAME FROM.
OH, WAIT, THAT'S HERE!
[LAUGHTER]BUT OBVIOUSLY BESTOWING REFUGEE
STATUS ON MULTIBILLION DOLLARCORPORATIONS ATTEMPTING TO
MAXIMIZE PROFIT THROUGHGLOBALIZED TAX EVASION IS
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE.
LET'S MEET ONE OF THESE POORCORPORATE WAIFS,
PENNSYLVANIA'S MYLANPHARMACEUTICAL.
NO, THAT'S AN ACTUAL REFUGEE.ACTUALLY, THAT'S, WELL YOU KNOW
WHAT, LET'S REFUGEE UP THE LOGOA LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE CAN...
OKAY.
GREAT.
THAT'S NICE.
WHERE IS THIS POOR CORPORATIONSEEKING ASYLUM?
>> THIS MONTH MYLAN ANNOUNCEDTHAT IT WOULD INCORPORATE IN THE
NETHERLANDS AS PART OF A TAXINVERSION DEAL.
>> Jon: POOR, GENERIC DRUGCOMPANY.
LIFE WAS SO BAD FOR MYLAN IN THEU.S. THAT IT DECIDED TO GO FROM
PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH TO JUST PLAINDUTCH.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, HERE ARE SOME OF THE
TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THAT MYLANFACED IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY.
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INOPPRESSIVE TAX CREDITS FOR
THINGS LIKE ECONOMICOPPORTUNITY, FOR THINGS LIKE
INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, FOR THINGSLIKE MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT,
FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,FOR SOMETHING CALLED "STRATEGIC
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT."
WHICH IS APPARENTLY A WHOLE[BLEEPED] DIFFERENT THING THAN
REGULAR RESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENT.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROOM.
SUPER CREDITS AGAINST BUSINESSFRANCHISE TAXES, SUPER CREDITS
AGAINST CORPORATE NET TAXES,EVEN A TAX CREDIT FOR
REHABILITATING AN HISTORICBUILDING.
YES, TAXPAYERS GAVE AMULTIBILLION DOLLAR GENERIC
BONER PILL COMPANY MONEY TOARTIFICIALLY PROP UP AN AGING
STRUCTURE LONG PAST THE POINTTHAT NATURE MEANT FOR IT TO
COLLAPSE TO RUBBLE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]BY THE WAY, IF THAT BUILDING
STANDS FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS,YOU MAY WANT TO, YOU MAY WANT TO
CALL YOUR ARCHITECT.
[LAUGHTER]BUT ALONG WITH TAX CREDITS, THE
OPPRESSIVE AMERICAN REGIME ALSOFORCED MYLAN TO ACCEPT $3
BILLION IN SALES FROM JUST THEV.A. SINCE 2009, ALTHOUGH SINCE
IT'S THE V.A., I ASSUME THOSEWERE FOR AILMENTS FROM THE
'90s.
NOW, WE KNOW HOW CONSERVATIVESFEEL ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMSTHEY'RE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO.
>> REMEMBER THE SURFER DUDE,LIVES ON FOOD STAMPS, USES YOUR
TAX DOLLARS TO EAT LOBSTER.
>> THIS GUY IS A PARASITE.
>> JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKEADVANTAGE OF A SYSTEM DOESN'T
MEAN YOU SHOULD.
AND I WONDER WHERE HIS PARENTSARE.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I BELIEVE IT'S THE
NETHERLANDS.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TAKETOO MUCH ADVANTAGE OF
ENTITLEMENTS, HOW DO YOU FEELABOUT CORPORATIONS WHO ON A MUCH
LARGER SCALE AND THROUGH MORALLYDUBIOUS YET ENTIRELY LEGAL MEANS
[BLEEPED] OVER THE UNITED STATESGOVERNMENT WHILE STILL ENJOYING
ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE ANDSECURITY BENEFITS SAID
GOVERNMENT PROVIDES?
>> THE COMPANY IS MORECOMPETITIVE WHEN IT PUTS ITS
LEGAL HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS. >> IT MAKES NO SENSE
FOR THEM TO PAY A HIGHER TAXBILL IF THEY CAN AVOID IT.
>> THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARYOBLIGATION TO THEIR
SHAREHOLDERS.
>> ABBOTT LAB C.E.O. MILES WHITESAYS ESSENTIALLY THIS IS LEGAL.
KUDOS TO HIM FOR STANDING UP ASA C.E.O. AND TAKING A STAND.
YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE THAT.
>> Jon: OH, KUDOS.
YOU SO RARELY SEE FIDUCH-BAGSLIKE THAT DEFENDING
THE POLICIES THAT MAKETHEIR COMPANIES PROFITABLE.
IT'S LIKE SEEING A UNICORN,STUPID UNICORNS, ALWAYS
EATING YOUR GARBAGE ATNIGHT, SCURRYING ALL
OVER THE SUBWAY, SPREADINGDISEASE AND PESTILENCE.
I MEAN, THAT'S... I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING TOLD I'M BEING TOLDI'M THINKING OF RATS.
THAT'S RATS. I ALWAYSCONFUSE RATS WITH UNICORNS.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY MYDAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS
SUCH A DISASTER.
[LAUGHTER]WOW, WOW, LOOK AT MY LEAN BODY.
DRESSED IN MY TRADEMARK JEANS.
WHEN DOES THIS END?
WHEN, I SAY, GETTING BACK TO THEBIT?
WE ARE CONSTANTLY GIVING IN TOEVERY DEMAND AND WHIM OF
CORPORATIONS.
AND YET THEY'RE STILL NOTSATISFIED.
THEY'LL NEVER BE SATISFIED.
MYLAN WAS PAYING AN EFFECTIVETAX RATE IN THE UNITED STATES OF
16.2% IN 2013.
RATHER THAN THE 35% CORPORATETAX RATE THAT THERE IS.
THEY WERE ENJOYING ENORMOUSGOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, THE
BENEFITS OF OUR NIH RESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENT AND IT'S STILL NOT
ENOUGH.
THEY JUST WANT AND WANT AND WANTWITH NO CONCERN -- WAIT A
MINUTE.
WHEN WAS THE CITIZENS UNITEDDECISION.
THAT WAS 2010, RIGHT?
THAT EXPLAINS IT.
CORPORATIONS HAVE ONLY BEENPEOPLE FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS.
[LAUGHTER]THEY'RE TODDLERS.
AND BY GIVING IN EVERY TIME THEYTHROW A TANTRUM AND THREATEN TO
RUN AWAY FROM HOME, WE'RESPOILING THESE BASTARDS.
IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, THESECORPORATIONS WILL GROW UP FERAL
AND TURN INTOSOMETHING EVEN WORSE.
YEAH. IF WE DON'T START TELLINGCORPORATIONS NO, THEY'RE GOING
TO JUST END UP PEEING IN BUCKETSAND TRYING TO SNEAK MONKEYS INTO
GERMANY.
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TELLCORPORATIONS, IF YOU WANT TO
LIVE UNDER OUR ROOF, YOU PLAY BYOUR RULES, SO, NO, MYLAN, YOU
CAN'T GO TO HOLLAND.
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
