TAX CUTS, AND WE APPRECIATE IT.

HAVE TO PAY ANY TAX.
IT'S UNIQUE, KANSAS IS THE ONLY STATE DOING THAT.

MORE REVENUE AND MORE JOBS?  THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
>> YOU'RE LIVING IN A KANSAS UTOPIA RIGHT NOW OF
REPUBLICAN BONERS.
YES, THIS WOULD BE THE ERECTIONOF A CONSERVATIVE UTOPIA.

TO JOBS CREATED.
>> JUST BECAUSE WE GOT A TAX CUTDIDN'T MEAN WE NEED TO HIRE MORE
PEOPLE.  WE PUT THAT MONEY IN OUR POCKET.

YOU GET TAX CUTS AND THEN YOUUSE  THAT TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE.

A DANCER.THAT'S TWO JOBS FOR ONE
TRACTOR.>> OH GOSH.

EDUCATION.

KANSAS IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE STATE.
THEY'VE CLOSED FIVE SCHOOL BUILDINGS IN OUR DISTRICT.
CLASS SIZE IS GOING UP.

IN KANSAS ARE FARMING ANDAEROSPACE.
YOU DO NOT NEED TO GO TO SCHOOLFOR THAT.
YOU CAN LEARN THATFROM YOUR PAPPY.

OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR KANSAS.

SOMETHING THESOLIDLY CONSERVATIVE STATE OF
KANSAS COULD NEVERHAVE IMAGINED.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS, ELECTEDOFFICIALS WHO THINK THAT KANSAS
IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
WE'RE SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRATFOR THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN
KANSAS.
