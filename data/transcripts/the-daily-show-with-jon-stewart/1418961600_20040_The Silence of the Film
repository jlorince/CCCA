AMERICA, AMERICA, 'MERICA. WE'VEBEEN
HAVING A BIT OF A BAD WEEK--MONTH -- EPOCH.
( LAUGHTER )BUT YOU KNOW WHO'S BEEN HAVING A
PRETTY GOOD WEEK-- TOTALITARIANREGIMES.
TAKE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE,NORTH KOREA.
AS YOU KNOW, THEY OR SOMEMERCENARY COMPUTER HACKERS, A
NERD TEAM 6 IF YOU WILL, BROKEINTO COMPUTERS AT SONY PICTURES
IN RETALIATION FOR THE UPCOMINGMOVIE "THE INTERVIEW," WHILE
APPARENTLY LEAVING SONYCOMPLETELY ALONE FOR
"AFTER EARTH."
I MEAN, THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE YOU HAVETHE MOST CHARISMATIC STAR IN THE
WORLD IN WILL SMITH.
HE'S STUCK IN A BUBBLE, CAN'T GOANYWHERE.
MEANWHILE, THE WHOLE MOVIE,SOME ( BLEEP ) KID IS FLYING
AROUND IN A MAGIC SQUIRREL SUIT.I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING.
AND THE BAD GUYS CAN ONLY SEEYOU IF THEY SMELL FEAR.
GUESS WHAT?
IT'S A VISUAL MEDIUM.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
OH, WELL, APPARENTLY, THETHREATENED EXPOSURE OF MORE
CATTY E-MAILS DIDN'T SLOW SONYDOWN IN THEIR VILLAINOUS PLOT TO
RELEASE A COMEDY. SO THE HACKERSWENT TO PLAN B.
>> THEY CLAIMED THEATERS THATSHOW SONY'S NEW COMEDY
"THE INTERVIEW" WILL FACE9/11-STYLE ATTACKS.
>> Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, WHENDID 9/11 BECOME A STYLE OF
ATTACKS?
( LAUGHTER )"WE HEARD YOU WERE INTERESTED IN
ATTACKING SOMETHING.
WE'VE ASSEMBLED A PINTREST PAGE.LITTLE INSPIRATION BOOK OF --
TELL US WHAT STYLE OF ATTACKYOU'D LIKE.
MAYBE A 9/11, MAYBE A DRESDEN."
BUT THE POINT IS, YOU'VE DONE  ( BLEEP ) UP NOW, BUDDY.
YOU STEPPED IN IT.
9/11 IS OUR MAGIC STRENGTH.
IT'S OUR SPINACH.
IT REMINDS US, WE DON'T GIVE IN,WE NEVER GIVE UP, WE DON'T BACK
DOWN.
>> THE SONY SPOKESPERSON SAYSTHE COMPANY WILL NOT BE
RELEASING THE FILM.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  OKAY.
NOT RELEASING IT IN THEATERS,BECAUSE VIDEO ON DEMAND IS A
DEMOCRATIZED TECHNOLOGY.
IT WILL INHABIT THE ENTIREEARTH.
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE, NORTHCOHACKERS.
CAUSE THESE COLORS DON'T RUN.
>> NO VIDEO ON DEMAND.
IT'S AS IF "THE INTERVIEW" NEVEREXISTED.
>> Jon:  ( BLEEP ) YOU.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S IT?
SO KIM JONG UN GETS TO DECIDEWHAT MOVIES WE MAKE?
SO THIS IS EVERY MOVIE FROM NOWON IS JUST THIS, "WORLD'S
BIGGEST PENIS, THE MOTIONPICTURE."
THAT'S IT.
ACTUALLY, HERE'S WHAT'SINTERESTING.
IN KOREAN, THAT TRANSLATES TOAFTER-GIRTH.
( LAUGHTER )FOR GOD'S SAKE, NORTH KOREA,
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.
THEY THREATEN PEOPLE WITHHYPERBOLIC LANGUAGE.
WHY DO WE FALL FOR THAT?
THAT'S THEIR HOOK.
>> NORTH KOREA HAS THREATENED TOTURN WASHINGTON INTO A SEA OF
FIRE.
>> Jon:  SEA OF FIRE!
WHAT?
AND DID WASHINGTON SHUT DOWN?
DID OUR GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN?
OKAY, YES, IT DID SHUT DOWN, BUTTHAT WASN'T WHY.
IT WAS A FUNDING DISPUTE.
BAD EXAMPLE.
THE POINT IS THIS-- KIM JONG UN,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO
MAD AT HOLLYWOOD.
YOU SHOULD LOVE THEM.
HOLLYWOOD IS JUST LIKE NORTHKOREA.
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS TELLING YOUHOW GREAT YOU ARE.
THERE ARE BILLBOARDS EVERYWHEREWITH YOUR FACE ON THEM AND NO
ONE EATS.
