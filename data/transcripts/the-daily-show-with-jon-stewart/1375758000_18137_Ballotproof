WANTS YOU TO RUN.
SO LOOK BEFORE WE GET
CARRIED AWAY HERE, YOU MAY
NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE VOTING FOR IN 2016.
>> LAST MONTH WHEN THE
SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN
SECTION 4 OF THE VOTING
RIGHTS ACT THE COURT OPENED
THE FLOODGATES TO A TIDAL
WAVE OF STATE RESTRICTION.
>> A TIDAL WAVE, A VOLCANO
OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT, A
SHARK-NADO OF VOTER
SUPPRESSION.
YES, EXACTLY.
EXACTLY.
IMAGINE YOUR VOTING RIGHTS
BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS.
>> THAT IS LET'S RALLY WHAT
THE SUPREME COURT HAS GIVEN
STATES LICENCE TO DO.
BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
IS ALREADY GEARING UP FOR
BATTLE.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
TODAY CHALLENGED VOTING LAWS
IT SAYS DISCRIMINATE ON THE
BASIS OF RACE.
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER
MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN
PHILADELPHIA PLEDGING TO
FOCUS FIRST ON TEXAS WITHIN
TEXAS FIRST, OKAY.
APPARENTLY ERIC HOLD
CERTIFICATE
APPARENT-- APPROACHING VOTER
RIGHTS PROTECTION LIKE WE
HIS FIRST DAY IN PRISON.
LOOK, I'M GOING FIND THE
BIGGEST-- THERE AND BEAT THE
[BLEEP] OUT OF HIM.
I'M SENDING A MESSAGE HERE.
THE OTHER STATES WILL FALL
IN LINE.
(APPLAUSE)
BUT LOOK, LOOK, I'VE GOT TO
SAY WHAT HAS TEXAS DONE TO
DESERVE THAT?
>> LITERALLY TWO HOURS AFTER
THE COURT'S RULING, TEXAS
OFFICIAL SAID THEY WOULD
BEGIN ENFORCING A NEW VOTER
REQUIREMENT EVEN THOUGH A
FEDERAL COURT STRUCK DOWN
THE LAW BECAUSE IT QUOTE
IMPOSES STRICT UNFORGIVING
BURDENS ON THE POOR AND
RACIAL MINORITIES IN TEXAS.
>> COME ON, TEXAS.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING FOR TWO
WHOLE HOURS?
DID IT TAKE YOU THAT LONG TO
MAKE THE CALL BECAUSE YOUR
HAND WAS SHAKING TOO MUCH
FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING
ABLE TO DISENFRANCHISE
VOTERS?
AND LET'S BE CLEAR.
TEXAS IS NOT ALONE IN ITS
RUSH TO IMPLEMENT
RESTRICTIVE NEW VOTING LAWS.
IN A PHRASE THAT IS ALMOST
NEVER UTTERED IN A
FLATTERING CONTEXT, FLORIDA
IS ALSO LEADING THE WAY.
>> FLORIDA CAN GO AHEAD WITH
THE VOTER PURGE.
A LAWSUIT WAS FILED LAST
YEAR TO STOP THE STATE FROM
TAKING NAMES OF SUSPECTED
NON-CITIZENS OFF THE VOTER
ROLES.
IT WAS DISMISSED YESTERDAY
IN A SUIT, LOST ITS FOOTING
AFTER THE SUPREME COURT
STRUCK DOWN PART OF THE
VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
>> AH, YES, FLORIDA, WHERE
YOUR GRANDPARENTS AND YOUR
RIGHT GOES TO DIE.
BUT PERHAPS A SURPRISE
CONTENDER FOR MOST DRACONIAN
VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION
CAME FROM A LITTLE FURTHER
NORTH.
>> LAST WEEK NORTH CAROLINA
PASSED ONE OF THE MOST
RESTRICTIVE VOTER
SUPPRESSION BILLS IN THE
NATION.
A BILL THAT SLASHES IN HALF
THE STATE'S EARLY VOTING
PERIOD, THEN ELIMINATES SAME
DAY VOTING REGISTRATION THAT
REQUIRES VOTERS TO SHOW A
GOVERNMENT ISSUED I.D..
>> IT DOESN'T STOP THERE T
ALSO PLACING ALL VOTING
BOOTHS ON BUOYS SO THEY ARE
ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY YACHTS.
NOW THE THING THAT OCCURS TO
ME IN ALL OF THIS
LEGISLATION IS WHAT PROBLEMS
ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE?
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
>> THE STATE ELECTIONS BOARD
SAID THAT THEY'VE ONLY HAD
ONE DOCUMENT CASE OF VOTER
IMPERSONATION FRAUD IN 2012.
YOU SAY --
>> THE IMPORTANT THING IS
ENHANCING CONFIDENCE IN
ELECTIONS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN
PEOPLE SHOW UP TO VOTE THEY
ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE.
>> OKAY, STOP THERE.
BECAUSE AS I BELIEVE HAS
BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE
PROBLEM ISN'T PEOPLE SHOWING
UP TO VOTE AND NOT BEING WHO
THEY SAY THEY ARE, IT'S
PERSON AS IN ONE, SINGULAR,
ONE GUY OUT OF FOUR AND A
HALF MILLION PEOPLE WHO
VOTED IN THE LAST ELECTION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> HONESTLY, YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN THE SAME RESULTS BY
JUST PASSING A BILL THAT
SAID DAVE CAN'T VOTE, HE
KNOWS WHY.
SO IF THAT'S NOT REALLY THE
REASON, THEN LET'S TRY THIS
AGAIN.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THERE?
>> ACCORDING TO NORTH
CAROLINA'S BOARD OF
ELECTIONS, A THIRD OF VOTERS
HERE WITHOUT A PHOTO I.D.
ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
>> AND THERE IT IS.
GOES TO SHOW IT'S TRUE,
ALWAYS BET ON BLACK.
ACTUALLY, NORTH CAR LINE'
VOTER-- HEY, WHO ARE YOU
ANGRY WITH?
!
WHO ARE YOU-- THE JOKE
STANDS.
ACTUALLY, NORTH CAROLINA
VOTER I.D. LAW IS JUST THE
TIP OF A TRUE [BLEEP]BURG OF
THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION.
>> IN NORTH CAROLINA THE
REPUBLICAN CONTROL STATED
LIMIT APPROVED NEW LIMITS ON
ABORTION CLINICS TACKED ON A
BILL DESIGNED TO BAN ISLAMIC
SHARIA LAW.
>> HOLD ON, LET ME JUST
UNDERSTAND THIS YOU'RE
ADDING ABORTION RESTRICTIONS
TO LEGISLATION BANNING THE
MAKING OF LAWS BASED UPON
RELIGIOUS BELIEF?
THAT'S LIKE PASSING A BILL
BANNING HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN
SYRUP AND ADDING A PROVISION
NAMING THE STATE ANIMAL THE
GUMMI BEAR.
NOW TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIR,
THAT WAS ONLY THE NORTH
CAROLINA STATE SENATE.
THE STATE HOUSE DID NOT DO
SOMETHING AS AMAZINGS ATTACK
AN ANTIABORTION LIMIT ON A
ANTISHARIA BILL.
THEY TACKED IT ON SOMETHING
ELSE.
>> WHAT DOES ABORTION HAVE
TO DO WITH MOTORCYCLE
SAFETY?
>> GOOD QUESTION?
(LAUGHTER)
>> GOOD QUESTION.
THAT'S A TRICKY ONE.
IS IT THAT VOTERS INVOLVE
GUYS IN LEATHER JACKETS YOUR
PARENTS DIDN'T WANT YOU TO
DATE?
S.
>> REMEMBER LAST WEEK WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT A NEW
ABORTION BILL IN THE STATE
SENATE THAT WAS TIED TO
SHARIA LAW BAN, WE TALKED
ABOUT THAT.
>> WE Z THIS WEEK THE
REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED NORTH
CAROLINA HOUSE ATTACHED A
SIMILAR BILL TO A MOTORCYCLE
SAFETY BILL.
>> THAT DOES SEEM RIDICULOUS.
ABORTIONS HAVE NOTHING IN
COMMON WITH MOTORCYCLE
HELMETS.
FOR ONE THING YOU CAN GET A
MOTORCYCLE HELMET PRETTY
MUCH ANYWHERE.
BUT AFTER-- AFTER A NORTH
CAROLINA LEGISLATIVE SESSION
LIKE THIS, I THINK THE BIG
TAKE AWAY HERE MIGHT BE YOUR
MOVE, SOUTH CAROLINA.
OH, YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD
CRAZIEST CAROLINA ALL SEWN
UP DIDN'T YOU WITH YOUR RUN
AWAY GOVERNORS AND RAMPANT
HORSE [BLEEP] AND IT GIVES
ME NO PLEASURE SAYING THIS.
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOSE
