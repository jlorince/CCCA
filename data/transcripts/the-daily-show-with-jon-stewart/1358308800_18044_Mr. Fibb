[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.

>> ON MONDAY LANCE ARMSTRONG ADMITTING DOPING WHILE HE WAS WINNING THE TOUR DE FRANCE SEVEN TIMES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: I BELIEVED IN YOU LANCE ARMSTRONG.
I SHELLED OUT A DOLLAR FOR A RUBBER BRACELET THAT I HAVE SOMEWHERE IN MY HOUSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOR YOU!
I DID IT FOR YOU.
AND WHEN I THINK OF THE FACT THAT I SPENT A --
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I THINK WE ALL OWE CANCER AN APOLOGY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR IS THAT NOT THE LESSON IN ALL THIS?
WELL, LISTEN ARMSTRONG IS A CHEATER BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA'S SECOND FAVORITE
CYCLIST WHO I'M SURE IS IN THERE CYCLIST.
AMERICA'S SECOND FAVORITE CYCLIST.
LET'S CALL HIM BIKIE JOE, I GUESS.
WHO GOT HIM TO COME OUT WITH THE TRUTH?
WHAT ENTITY IS MORE POWERFUL THAN LADY JUSTICE?
>> BREAKING NEWS, IT'S SAID THAT LANCE ARMSTRONG HAS CONFESSED IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH OPRAH OPRAH WINFREY
THAT HE USED PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS.
>> Jon: I DON'T READ ANY MY GUEST BOOKS OH, MY GOD!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
MY iPOD IS ONLY BOY BANDS.
WHY AM I DOING THIS?
I CAN'T NOT CONFESS.
NO!
GODFATHER 3 IS THE BEST -- NO!
I'M HYPNOTIZED BY HER LOOK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I AM (bleep) THIS SHOW UP LEFT AND RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE WELCOME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I APPLAUD YOUR LACK OF PREPARATION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE INTERVIEW DOESN'T AIR UNTIL THURSDAY ON THE OWN NETWORK WHICH STANDS FOR OPRAH WIN
FRIDAY IS NOT ON CHANNEL 7 ANYMORE.
YOU'LL FIND IT.
IT'S SURPRISINGLY CANDID AND TIMELY CONVERSATION WITH GAYLE KING OF CBS NEWS OPRAH DESCRIBES
THE INTERACTION.
>> I WOULD SAY THAT HE DID NOT COME CLEAN IN THE MANNER THAT I EXPECTED.
IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME.
I WOULD SAY THAT FOR MYSELF, MY TEAM, ALL OF US IN THE ROOM, WE WERE MESMERIZED AND RIVETTED BY
SOME OF HIS ANSWERS.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD WATCH IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BY THE WAY THAT INTERVIEW IS NOT ON SATELLITE, OPRAH JUST APPEARS TO GAYLE WHENEVER GAYLE GAZES
INTO A REFLECTIVE SURFACE.
LANCE ARMSTRONG WAS DOPING.
OF COURSE HE WAS.
YOU CAN BEST CANCER AND YOU CAN WIN THE TOUR DE FRANCE BUT YOU CAN'T BEAT THE TOUR DE FRANCE 7
TIMES AND BEAT CANCER OR VICE VERSA MEANING YOU HAVE WON THE TOUR DE FRANCE AND LOST SEVEN TESTICLES.
IT'S OBVIOUS IN HINDSIGHT.
IT'S LIKE THE TOOTH FAIRY.
OF COURSE, A WINGED FAIRY SPENDS HER LIFE COLLECTING BABY TEETH YET SOMEHOW HAS MONEY IN HER
POCKET TO GIVE OUT.
DEFIES CREDIBILITY.
ANY IDIOT WITH HALF A BRAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE ARMSTRONG OF LYING.
THEY'VE BEEN TESTING ME LIKE CRAZY.
THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU.
DON'T THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AT A CERTAIN POINT?
>> Jon: HELLO!
HELLO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NAILED IT AGAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FOR AS GOOD AS INTERVIEWING AS I AM, I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF ARMSTRONG WAS ALSO BANGING DAVID PATREAUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LOOKING AT HOW THE TWO OF US HAVE AGED SINCE THAT INTERVIEW, I NEED TO START DOPING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO ARMSTRONG ADMITS DOPING.
IT'S A LONG ROAD BACK TO REDEMPTION.
HOW CAN HE FIND HIMSELF BACK TO AMERICA'S GOOD GRACES.
>> HE HAS INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO TESTIFY AGAINST
