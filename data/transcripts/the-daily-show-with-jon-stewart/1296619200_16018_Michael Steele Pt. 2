MICHAEL STEELE, WE FINALLY GOT
YOU ON THE PROGRAM.Q/z
WHY COULD WE NOTjF BRING YOU?
WE TRIED SO DESPERATELY WHEN
YOU FIRSTç"BECAMExD RNC.
THEN ALLr
THOUGH THEÑi STEELfá CURTAIN CAME
DOWN AND WE COULD NOT GET
AHOLD OF YOU.
>> I'VE NOT BEEN KNOWN FOR
STAYING ON THE TALKING POINTS.
I KIND OF GET INTO THE FLOWÑi OF
THINGS AND I'M A VERYfá
STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOOTER.
I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT I
THINK.
I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY IN THIS9!
JOB THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WELCOM
>> Jon: WHO WOULD TELL YOU
THAT?
WHO WOULD COME TOw3 YOU AND SAY.
>> MYw+ COMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE.
I'D GET A PHONE CALL FROM
LEADERSHIP ON THE HILLçóxD OR, YOU
KNOW, STAFF.lp
THOSE ANONYMOUS NAMES AND
PLACES AND FACES THATe1 YOU
HEAR.
>> Jon: THEY WOULD SAY,ñr
MICHAEL, PLEASE, WHATEVER YOU
DO, DON'T GO OUTSIDE?
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Jon: STAY WITH US.
>> STAY WITH US.
>> Jon: THIS RECENTxD ELECTION
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAD AN ENORMOUS
VICTORY IN THEok MIDTERMS.
DO YOU FEEL LIKE A COACH THAT
TOOK YOUR TEAM TO THE
PLAY-OFFS AND YET WAS CANNED
AFTERWARDS?
>> A LITTLE BIT.
ABSOLUTELY.xD
WE WORKED VERY HARD.
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERExD IN THE
BEGINNING OFxD 2009.
TWO YEARS AGO AT THIS TIMEÑi
WHEN I BECAME CHAIRMAN, WE
WEREM6| PARTY THAT WAS OUT OF
POWER.
WE HAD BEEN BASICALLY
WHIPSAWED AND TO USE THE
PRESIDENT'S TERM SHELLACKED INÑi
'06 AND '08.
WE COULDN'T FIND PEOPLE TO RUN
ASU
THEY WERE REPUBLICANS SO ITPj(
WAS A REAL MESS.
WE CAME IN.e1
WE PUT OUR HEADS DOWN TO
FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY THAT
BEGAN WITH REIGNITING OUR BASE
TALKING OUR BASE,MY| RECONNECTING
WITH THEM.
>> Jon: WHY IS IT SO EASY.V:5"
THEM.
IGNITE YOUR BASE?
THEY ARE SO FLAMMABLE, YOUR
BASE.
>> A CREDITORt( INCITEABLE
BUNCH.
THAT'Sç$
BUT THAT'S Açó VERY GOOD POINT
AND A VERY FAIR POINT.
YOU SEE IT ON BOTH THE RIGHT
AND THE LEFT AMONG THEk
DEMOCRA
DURING THExD BUSH YEARS YOU SAW
A-9| VERY WELL ORGANIZED AND IP,|
THOUGHT WELL COMMUNICATED
STRATEGY BY THENB| FOLKS ON THE
LEFT ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ.
NOW YOU HAVE INñr THE AGE OF
OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TIME,
YOU'VE GOT THE ECONOMY.i]
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT
REPUBLICANS FEEL VERY STRONGLY
ABOUTt( ANDtY
>> Jon: SELLING THEMSELVES AS
THE PARTY OF FISCAL
RESPONC[%1%Qe9ñ
THE PARTY IS AND CERTAINLY IN
THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE
GOTTEN INTO BIG
REPUBLICANISM WHICH
A LOT OFYm| PEOPLE THE BASE,
TURNED AWAY A L/á
INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHO
SUPPORTED
BACKr
WEREN'T TRUE TOçó WHAT WE WERE
SAYING WHAT WEfá WOULD DO.
>> Jon:ñr EVEN WITH REAGANÑi,Ñiq
REAGAN RAN BIGw3 DEFICITS.
HE RAISED TAXES.r
>> THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN
IT COMES TO SOME OF WHAT
PRESIDENTñr REAGAN DID AS
GOVERNOR AND AS PRESIDENT.
I MEAN ADMITTEDLY SO.U
>> Jon: DOESN'T
TH%ØJUt THOUGH?
>> I THINK ,1DPS ALSOq
STRONG SENSE OF, YOU KNOW,
IDEAL.
THE PARTYA5... A LOT OF TH%|D
ACTIVISTS IN THE PARTY DOHt
STRIVE TOWARDS THE IDEAL.
IT'S TRUE FOR BOTH DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANSt(t( NOT JUST SEND
IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE
POLITICAL SPEC STRUM.
>> Jon: WITHÑixD DEMOCRATS THEY
CANNOT ARTICULATE THE IDEAL.t(
IF THERE WAS A DEMORBQ9rrrñ
>> IxD THINK THEYe1 DO.
>> Jon: WOULDq
GOVERNMENT.
>> THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT INjF
TERMS OF BIG GOVERNMENT.
THAT'S AN EASYr
SAY.
WHATçó THExD PRESIDENT TALKSñr ABOUT
IN THE STATE OF THE UNION
TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENT.
WE
SPENDING.
IT'S HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO
AND THEN COMMUNICATE THATt(
BEYOND.
>> Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THEORY ANDñr PRACTICE.
THE RNC IS NOW 21 OR 23
MILLIONfT"u
THE PARTY OF FISCAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
IS THAT....
>> BUT TpA
(LAUGHING)t(w3
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: I WANT TO HEAR HIM.çó
>> THAT'S A FAIR POINT.ó[|
THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE BUDGET
COMMITTEE HEARING, MEETING,
SHOWED I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND
THE MONEY.
I WAS VERY HESITANTok ABOUT
COMMITTING OURSELVES TO
ADDITIONAL LINES OF CREDIT.
BUT IT IS PART OF....
>> Jon: YOU RAISED YOUR DEBT
LIMIT.xD
>> EXACTLY.
AND, LOOK, IT WILL GET PAID
OFF.ñr
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
CERTAINLY THE NEW CHAIRMANñr
WASTED NO TIME DOINGÑi HISD
TENURE WORKING WITHxD ME ASKING
FORxDlp MONEY.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.ok
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE
REPMa
FORECLOSED ON.
I'M SAYINGñr
A PARTY TO SAY WE
PARTY OF FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
BUT WE'RE RUNNING Afá HUGE DEBT.
>> THAT'S EVERYñr PARTY, BOTH
PARTIES HAVE DEBT RIGHT NOW.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLIIa
SO YOU'RE SAYING THE DEMOCRATS
ARE SHOWINGÑi THEIR TRU
BY SPENDING WILDLY
ABANDON.
>> Jon: YES.
>> OKAY.t(
>> Jon: NOBODY WOULD SUGGEST
THAT THEt( DEMOCRATS....
>> THE DIFFERENCE IS WE WON.
>> Jon: THAT'S FOR SURE.
>> THE VALUE ADDED TO THE
DOLLAR SPENT IS-9 MUCH GREATER
FOR US BECAUSE WEçó HAVE 63
MEMBERS IN THE CONGRESS, 21
STATE LEGISLATORSñr CHANGED FROM
DEMOCRAT TO REPUBLICAN.
IT'S A DIFFERENTlp
>> Jon: YOU HAVE A STIMULUS
PROGRAM THROUGH DEFICIT
SPENDING.r
THAT CREATED A POSITIVE
RESULT.
THAT IGNITED YOUR BASE.Ñie1ñr
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> DO YOUe1 THINKÑi YOU WANT TO
TRY THAT AT THE NATIONAL |
LEVEL?
MAYBE IT WILL WORK AT THE
NATIONAL LEVEL.
>> Jon: IT'S INTERESTING.
DO YOUñr FEEL LIKE THE
REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO
DELIVERñrñr ON... IS IT
DISINGENUOUS TO SOME EXTENT TO
BE CALLING FOR FISCAL
RESPONSIBILITY
AN ADMINISTRATIONt( THAT RAISED
DOUBLED IT, THAT HAD
UNACCOUNTED FOR EXPENSESt(,
THExD AFGHAN WAR.
>> THAT'S A FAIR POINT.
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE
PRICE THAT WE PAID IN THE
PREVIOUS ELECTIONS WHERE WEÑi
DID GO ON THE SPENDING RUN,
WHERE WE DID GROW THE SIZE OF
GOVERNMENT, WHERE WE DIDq
CREATE ADDITIONAL DEBT AND
BURDENED THE FUTURE
GENERATIONS.
WE PAIDS7 DEARLY FOR THAT AT THE
BALLOT BOX INt( '06 AND '08.
PARTN
LAST YEAR WAS THE PARTY
REORGANIZING ITSELF,
RETHINKING ITS POSITIONS AND
REALLY STANDING TRUE.
NOW THE TEST-- AND WE KNOW
THIS.
THEY'RE ON PROBATION.
WHAT THE HOUSE DOES WHEN ITA
WHAT THE SENATE DOES WHEN IT
COMES TO SPENDING BILLS,
WHETHER ORt( NOT....
>> Jon: WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
THEM NOT RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING?
WILL IT BE ALMOST AN
IDEOLOGICAL TEST TO SAY NO
RAISING OF THE2MQ DEBT CEILING?
>> I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME TO
THAT.
I THINK WE'VE GOT TOO MANY
PEOPLE AREr
TOO MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE
HURTING RIGHT NOW.
I THINK THERE HAS GOT TO BE
SERIOUS BRAKES PUT ON THE
SPENDING.
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE
THE LIMIT PUT A LOT OF STRINGS
ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO DO WITH ADDITIONAL SPENDINGq
GOING FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
INCREASE THATw3 AMOUNT.
ANDXT
WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY OR
ANY RECOURSE WITH THE(AíERICAN
PEOPLE.
>> Jon: NOT NOW WITH THEçó
DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE.
>> NOfálp BECAUSE AS YOU'VE
ALREADY ADMITTED THEn@| SPENDING
HAS GONE CRAZY.
>> Jon: NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
RELEASED FROM THE IDEA THAT
PEOPLE DON'Tçó WANT!U YOU TO
APPEAR ON SHOWS WILL YOU COME
BACK AGAIN.
>> Jon: BECAUSE WYATT'S ARM
HURTS TERRIBLY WHEN HE DOES
THAT.
í8 I THINK I'M A BETTER STAND-
IN.
>> Jon: MUCH BETTER.
WE TRULY APPRECIATE YOU
