MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
FROM THE FILM "DALLAS BUYERSCLUB" THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE YOU
HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT.
JARED LETO IS HERE.
UNBELIEVABLE.
LISTEN TO THIS, WE'RE CURRENTLYIN WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS THE MOST
WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR.
[LAUGHTER]WHY NOT?
[LAUGHTER]FESTIVE TREES GO UP, CAROLERS
BREAK OUT IN SONG.
STARBUCKS SWITCHES OUT THE VATOF PUMPKIN SPICE ADDITIVES FOR
THE VAT OF PEPPERMINT ADDITIVES.
IT'S A TIME TO CHERISH WHAT WEHAVE BECAUSE WE COULD LOSE IT.
>> HOW MINORITIES ARE BECOMINGTHE MAJORITY AT THE COMMUNITYG
POOL.
HOW SHARIA LAW IS CHANGINGEVERYTHING.
>> Jon: IT'S CHANGINGEVERYTHING AND PROBABLY NOT FOR
THE BETTER.
WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHARIALAW IS I KNOW IT'S MUSLIM-Y.
AND IF FOX IS TALKING ABOUT ITIT'S THE KIND OF MUSLIM-Y THAT
ISGOING TO DESTROY THE NATION.
>> A YMCA IN ST. PAUL ISSTARTING A SWIM GROUP FOR MUSLIM
GIRLS BUT SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONSHAVE TO BE MADE TO KEEP WITH
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.
[ LAUGHTER ]WAIT, WHAT HAS CHANGED?
>> DURING THE ONE HOUR CLASS THEPOOL IS SHUT DOWN, MEN'S LOCKER
ROOM IS LOCKED AND FEMALELIFEGUARDS ARE BROUGHT IN.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD EVERYTHINGHAS CHANGED.
DOGS WALK BABIES, DANCING MAKESYOU SAD.
TEARS COME OUT OF YOUR EARS ANDSNOT COMES OUT OF YOUR BUTT
WHICH IS NOT HOW IT IS NOW, ICAN TELL YOU THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]ACTUALLY THOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE
THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CHANGEDBECAUSE OF SHARIA LAW IS ONE
YMCA POOL'S SCHEDULE WHITEBOARD.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING.
I COULD SEE HOW THAT COULDBE TRAUMATIC.
FIRST THEY CAME FOR OUR TUESDAYSYNCHRONIZED AQUA DANCE AND I
DID NOT SPEAK OUT.
