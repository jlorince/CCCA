( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
OUR OLD FRIEND REZA ASLAN WILLBE JOINING US AND WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT ALL KINDS OFSTUFF, MOSTLY GOD.
YOU KNOW, I'M WATCHING FOX NEWSWHICH I'LL CONTINUE TO DO NOW
FOR ANOTHER, I DON'T KNOW, 36SHOWS MINUS TODAY'S OPEN.
AND WHILE WE OFTEN POKE FUN ATTHEM FOR LYING AND SUCKING.
THEY DO CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUTCERTAIN ISSUES, LIKE BENGHAZI.
OR WOMEN'S LEGS.
OR THAT TIME ONE OF THEIR FEMALEANCHORS DIDN'T WEAR A DRESS, NOW
KNOWN AS PANTS-GHAZI.
( LAUGHTER )THE POINT IS, AFTER FOX FINISHES
CARING ABOUT LOTS OF OTHER STUFFTHEY EVENTUALLY CARE VERY DEEPLY
ABOUT POVERTY.
>> WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUTPOVERTY FROM THE OBAMA WHITE
HOUSE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS.>> RIGHT.
>> VIRTUALLY NO EMPHASIS ONFAMILIES.
>> WHY NOT FOCUS ON POVERTY?
>> I REMEMBER FIVE OR SIX YEARSAGO, PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING THIS
ONE OF HIS MAIN TALKING POINTS--I'M GOING TO FIX THE STRUCTURE
OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY.
WHERE DID THAT GO?
>> Jon: AND WHILE THE PRESIDENTHAS BEEN ADDRESSING THOSE
ISSUES, HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY,GOOD POINT.
( LAUGHTER )IN FACT, YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT
OBAMA SAT DOWN FOR A 76-MINUTEDISCUSSION AT GEORGETOWN
UNIVERSITY IN WHICH HE EXPLAINEDALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THEDEBATE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT
ASSISTANCE AND PERSONALRESPONSIBILITY AS BEING A FALSE
CHOICE AND FAMILIES, ET CETERA.
>> A FREE MARKET IS PERFECTLYCOMPATIBLE WITH ALSO US MAKING
INVESTMENT IN GOOD PUBLICSCHOOLS, PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES,
INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC PARKS.
IF WE DO THOSE THINGS, THEVALUES AND THE CHARACTER THAT
THOSE KIDS ARE LEARNING, THEY'RELESS LIKELY TO GET PREGNANT AS
TEENS AND LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGEIN DRUGS AND LESS LIKELY TO BE
INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINALJUSTICE SYSTEM.
THAT IS A REINFORCEMENT OF THEVALUES AND CHARACTERS THAT WE
WANT.
I AM A BLACK MAN WHO GREW UPWITHOUT A FATHER, AND I KNOW THE
COSTS THAT I PAID FOR THAT.
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT I HAD THECAPACITY TO BREAK THAT CYCLE.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHO ELSETALKS WITH HIS HANDS?
HITLER.
SO FOX FINALLY GOT THESUBSTANTIVE PRESIDENTIAL
DISCUSSION ON POVERTYTHAT THEY ALWAYS WANTED,
INCLUDING ONSTAGE, THE COUNTER-VIEW FROM THE
HEAD OF THE CONSERVATIVEAMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE.
HE WAS ON STAGE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE FOX'SHAPPINESS AND SATISFACTION.
>> FOX NEWS ALERT.
FOX NEWS FRONT AND CENTER.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING TIMEOUT TODAY FOR ONE OF HIS
FAVORITE TOPICS-- FOX NEWS!
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ACCUSED FOXNEWS OF PROPAGATING HARMFUL
STEREOTYPES ABOUT POORAMERICANS.
>> THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED THEMEDIA, IN PARTICULAR FOX NEWS,
FOR SUGGESTING THE POOR AREUNWILLING TO WORK.
>> Jon:  YUP, JUST LIKECOLLEGE STUDENTS AT A FOUR-HOUR
COMMENCEMENT, FOX BASICALLY PAYSNO ATTENTION UNTIL THEY HEAR
THEIR OWN NAMES.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
IT TURNS OUT AT ONE POINT-- ( CHEERS )
IN THIS-- AT ONE POINT IN THISINCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL AND
PRODUCTIVE SESSION ON POVERTY,THE PRESIDENT MADE THE EASILY
PROVABLE AND DECIDEDLY TRUEPOINT THAT FOX NEWS NARRATIVE IS
THAT POVERTY IS NOT A FUNCTIONOF ECONOMIC CONDITION BUT OF
CHARACTER.
>> THE EFFORT TO SUGGEST THATTHE POOR ARE SPONGES, LEECHES,
ARE-- DON'T WANT TO WORK, ARELAZY, IF YOU WATCH FOX NEWS ON A
REGULAR BASIS, IT IS A CONSTANTMENU.
THEY WILL FIND, LIKE FOLKS WHOMAKE ME MAD.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY FINDTHEM. RIGHT?
THEY'RE ALL LIKE--( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T WANT TO WORK.
I JUST WANT A FREE OBAMA PHONE.
( LAUGHTER )OR WHATEVER.
AND THAT BECOMES AN ENTIRENARRATIVE.
>> REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  YEAH, REALLY.
>> REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  REALLY.
>> REALLY?
>> Jon:  YES!
WHAT'S WITH YOUR TONE OF DISGUSTAND DISAPPOINTMENT.
ARE YOU ANCHORING A NEWS DESK ORDID YOU JUST COME HOME TO FIND
YOUR DOG HAD EATEN YOUR CAT'SENTIRE LITTER BOX.
ROSCO!
REALLY.
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THEPRESIDENT HAS A REMARKABLY FIRM
GRASP ON YOUR BUSINESS MODELTHERE, FOX.
SO WHY ARE YOU OUTRAGED?
>> IN MY OPINION, THE PRESIDENTIS SPINNING HIS OWN POLICY
FAILURES.
AS FOR MIDDLE-CLASS SHRINKS ANDTHE POOR ARE TRAPPED IN THE
SYSTEM, SO TO SPEAK, THEPRESIDENT BLAMES US, THE HONEST
MESSENGERS.( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  THE "HONESTMESSENGERS."
MARTHA?
>> REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WHAT-- WHAT-- DID IEVEN WATCH THE ( BLEEP )
PROGRAM?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,BARNEY?
>> WE'VE LOOKED AT THE FOODSTAMP PROGRAM NOT AT THE
RECIPIENTS.
WE HAVEN'T CHARACTERIZED THERECIPIENTS.
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE PROGRAM.
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERECIPIENTS OF FOOD STAMPS ARE
BAD PEOPLE OR THAT THEY'RE LAZY.
>> Jon: THAT IS SUCH A RICHBUFFET OF BULL ( BLEEP ), I
CAN'T -- THAT IS ATHREE-COURSE PRIX FIXE--
I'M SORRY, PRICK-FEST.
FOR STARTERS, LET'S DEMONSTRATEFOX'S CONTEMPT FOR THOSE IN
POVERTY IN OUR FIRST COURSE OFTHIS MEAL,
AN AMUSE DOUCHE, IF YOU WILL.
>> AMERICA'S POOR ARE ACTUALLYLIVING THE GOOD LIFE.
>> JUST CALL THEM PENNYS FROMTHE GOVERNMENT HEAVEN.
>> THE UNITED STATES OFENTITLEMENT.
>> A NATION OF TAKERS.
>> ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY.
>> SCARY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  WE HAVE NOTHINGAGAINST THE POOR.
IT'S JUST THAT THEIR RAVENOUSGREED BURST THROUGH AMERICA'S
CHEST LIKE THE MONSTER IN"ALIEN."
BUT I'M SORRY, YOU WERESAYING YOU DON'T CHARACTERIZE
THE POOR AS BAD PEOPLE OR LAZY?
WELL, YOUR ENTREE IS READY JUSTAS YOU ASKED FOR IT.
MEDIUM UNFAIR.
>> WE HAVE CONDITIONED PEOPLE TOLOOK TO THE GOVERNMENT TO BE
THEIR ANSWER FOR EVERY PROBLEMTHEY HAVE, AND TAKE ZERO
RESPONSIBILITY.

>> SITTING ON THE COUCH EATINGBON BONS.
>> PEOPLE WHO SLEEP UNTIL NOON.
>> SUCKING OFF, YOU KNOW, THENIPPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  HOW ( BLEEP )
REMOVED FROM REALITY IS FOX'SPERCEPTION OF THEIR OWN COVERAGE
ON POVERTY?
THE MAIN DEFENDER OF YOURNETWORK'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THOSE
IN POVERTY IS THE MAIN OFFENDER.
HE DOES SEGMENTS THAT WOULD MAKEEBENEZER SCROOGE GO, "HEY,
TAKE IT EASY.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WE'RE TALKINGABOUT."
FOR DESSERT TONIGHT WE SERVE YOUBAKED AL-[BLEEP]HOLE.
>> THE HANDOUT NATION ROLLS ON.
>> WE HAND OUT $7 BILLIONEVERY JANUARY TO THESE SO-CALLED
POOR PEOPLE.
>> YOU'RE NOT BEING MEAN TO POORPEOPLE TODAY.
>> I AM. I AM BEING MEAN TO POORPEOPLE. FRANKLY, I AM.
>> MANY POOR FAMILIES HAVE HOMESWITH CABLE TV, CELL PHONES,
COMPUTERS, YOU NAME IT-- MUCH,MUCH MORE.
99% HAVE A REFRIGERATOR.
81% HAVE A MICROWAVE.
>> YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US THEEMOTIONAL SIDE OF THE STORY,
PEOPLE NEED $15 PER HOUR TO LIVEON.
THEY'RE STARVING WITHOUT IT.
OKAY, I GOT THAT.
>> THE IMAGE WE HAVE OF POORPEOPLE AS STARVING AND LIVING IN
SQUALOR REALLY IS NOT ACCURATE.
MANY OF THEM HAVE THINGS.
WHAT THEY LACK IS A RICHNESS OFSPIRIT.
>> Jon:  ANYWAY, YOU BOY,WHAT DAY IS IT TODAY?
IS IT CHRISTMAS DAY?
OH, GO UP AND BUY ALL THEGOOSES.
KEEP THEM OUT OF THOSE LAZY POORHANDS.
AND IF YOU SEE A BOY ONCRUTCHES, PUSH HIM DOWN.

ARE THESE GLARING -- ARE THEY--I DON'T EVEN -- ARE THESE--
HONESTLY, ARE THESE GLARINGCONTRADICTIONS A PRODUCT OF A
LACK OF SELF-AWARENESS, ORCYNICISM, OR STUPIDITY OR EVIL.
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE AND I'MSTARTING TO LACK A RICHNESS OF
( BLEEP ).
( LAUGHTER )WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
ANOTHER JOURNALIST ON ANOTHERNETWORK LEAPING TO DEFEND
SOMETHING SO CLEARLYINDEFENSIBLE.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC CLIPABOUT FOX NEWS CALLING POOR
PEOPLE LEECHES,SPONGES, AND LAZY?
