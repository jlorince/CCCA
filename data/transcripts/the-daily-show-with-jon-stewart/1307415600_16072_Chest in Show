>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT,
PEOPLE.
OH, WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT PAST MAZIAR
BAHARI WILL BE JOINING US.
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE TIMES.
IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT PART
OF THE WORLD THERE IS
OPPRESSION, INSTABILITY,
UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE.
AND YET THE DREAM OF FREEDOM
LIVES ON.
IT'S THE TYPE OF STORY THAT
YOU, OUR VIEWERS, DESERVE.
NAY, NEED.
TO HEAR MORE ABOUT.
UNFORTUNATELY (BEEP) 2011.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT BETTER BE HIS SHOULDER.
(BEEP N (2011 HAS NOT RUN ITS
COURSE.
IT'S GETTING THERE.
FOR THE UNINITIATED, THIS
PHOTO WAS RAN SAYING IT WAS
SENT FROM ANTHONY WEINER'S
ACCOUNT.
THE CONGRESSMAN SUGGESTED HIS
TWITTER ACCOUNT HAD BEEN
HACKED.
HE SAID HE COULD NOT VERIFY
WITH CERTITUDE OR SURENESS.
THIS IS WHERE THE STORY STOOD
UNTIL TODAY WHEN A NEW PHOTO
WAS RELEASED THAT THE
CONGRESSMAN (BEEP) APPARENTLY
TOOK OF HIM.
WOW.
THAT IS SOME CLEAVAGE.
CAN WE ZOOM IN ON THAT ANY
CHANCE?
IS THERE ANYWAY TO....
>> I'M IN THE CANYON.
>> Jon: FRANK OH, I KNEW IT.
SO THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE
THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
SEGMENT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WISH YOU GUYS CHECKED WITH
ME BEFORE YOU ANYWAY, YOU KNOW
WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST
UPSETTING THING, THE MOST
UPSETTING THING ABOUT HAVING A
FRIEND CAUGHT UP IN A SCANDAL
OF THIS NATURE IS FINDING OUT,
A, HE'S PACKING JUMBO HEAT.
AND, B, THAT HE'S RIPPED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY AND I
ARE THE SAME (BEEP) AGE.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
HERE'S A PICTURE OF ME FROM
THIS MORNING.
I MEAN, GOOD, HOW GOOD IS THE
CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH CARE
PLAN?
ANYWAY TODAY WORD ON THE WEBB
WAS HASH TAG PLENTY MORE WHERE
THIS CAME FROM.
CONGRESSMAN WEINER SCHEDULED A
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR 4:00.
I DECIDED TO TUNE IN.
AND ANDREW BREITBART THE OWNER
OPERATOR OF THE WEBSITE BIG
GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEW YORK CITY,
SHOWED UP AND TOOK OVER
WEINER'S PRESS CONFERENCE.
>> I'D LIKE AN APOLOGY FROM
HIM.
I'M HERE FOR SOME VINDICATION.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE WEIRDEST
(BEEP) STORY I'VE EVER SEEN IN
MY LIFE.
OR THE GREATEST EPISODE OF
MAURY EVER.
SO, AFTER BREITBART'S 4:00
P.M. PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS
FOR CONGRESSMAN WEINER, IT WAS
TIME FOR CONGRESSMAN WEINER'S
POST BREITBART PRESS
CONFERENCE.
>> I HAVE MADE TERRIBLE
MISTAKES.
I'VE HURT THE PEOPLE I CARE
ABOUT THE MOST AND I AM DEEPLY
SORRY.
>> Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT.
AT 4:25 EASTERN STANDARD TIME
