MEAN WHILE, ON THE DEMOCRACTICSIDE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD
THE FIELD ALL TO HERSELF.
BUT THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.
>> TODAY, VERMONT THAT'S RIGHTBERNIE SANDERS KICKED OFF HIS
CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT.
>> HE'S A LONG SHOT.>> A LONG SHOT.
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TOBE TAKEN TOO INCREDIBLY.
>> BERNIE SANDERS A SOCIALIST,FOR GOD'S SAKE.
>> I THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT.
>> HE'S 73 YEARS OLD, HE LOOKS91.
> HE''S A LITTLE CRUSTY.
>> HE'S A LOON, ISN'T HE?
>> Jon: HE OWNS A V.H.S. COPY OFTOOTSIE!
THAT LAST ONE SEEMED KIND OFLIKE A WEIRD SLAM.
TOOTSIE IS A FINE FILM
CERTAINLY THE BESTCROSS-DRESSING DUSTIN HOFFMAN
MOVIE THAT'S BEEN RELEASEDPUBLICLY.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU KNOW, THE POINT ISSANDER 'S A LOON!
HE WEARS SOCKS ON HIS HANDS ANDGLOVES ON HIS FEET!
HE BUTTERS HIS BREAD WITHVASELINE!
HE LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDERTHE SEA.
IF SALVADOR DALI AND DR. SEUESSHAD A CHILD, AND THAT CHILD WAS
RAISED BY SCHIZOPRHENIC HOWLERMONKEYS, IT WOULD BE BERNIE
SANDERS!
GIVE ME A TASTE OF THIS CRAZYCUCKOO BIRD!
>> IF A BANK IS TOO BIG TO FAIL,THAT BANKS IS TOO BIG TO EXIST.
WE MUST ESTABLISH PAY EQUITY FORWOMEN WORKERS.
WE MUST BE FOCUSED ON CAMPAIGNFINANCE REFORM... INSTEAD OF
CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY, WE AREGOING TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY
BENEFITS!
>> Jon: WHAT A -- A -- A
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT A RATIONAL, SLIGHTLY LEFTOF CENTER,  MAINSTREAM
POLITICIAN.
I MEAN, HE'S EXCITABLE,CERTAINLY UNPOLISHED, AS
EVIDENCED BY HIS TO DELIVER HISINCOME EQUALITY SPEECH IN FRONT
OF A REGATTA.
BUT HE'S NOT CRAZY.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SANDERSAND HILLARY CLINTON, BESIDES THE
FACT SHE HAS HER OWN INTERNETSERVICE IN HER HOUSE AND HE
ISN'T SURE HE'S ONLINE UNLESS HEHEARS THIS --
[MODEM SOUND]
>> WELCOME.
>> Jon: BUT THE REAL DIFFERENCEIS, HILLARY HAS PROFESSIONAL
IMAGE HANDLERS...
TELLING HER TO COMB HER HAIR --
TODAY... AND TOMORROW... MAKEIT A REGULAR THING.
AND HILLARY INSTEAD OF USINGYOUR ACTUAL VOICE, MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE YOU'RE FROM WHATEVER REGIONIT IS YOU'RE TALKING TO.
IN FACT, HERE'S THE ILLINOIS-BORN, NEW ENGLAND-EDUCATED
SENATOR SPEAKING IN SOUTHCAROLINA.
>> I'M AWARE I MAY NOT BE THEYOUNGEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE,
BUT I HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE, IHAVE BEEN COLORING MY HAIR FOR
YEARS!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NOW ANYWAY, IF Y'ALLEXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GET
SHELL BY'S JUICE!
SHE'S HAVING A FIT!
WHERE ARE MY FRAYED GREENTOMATOES!
LISTEN UP, SENATOR, I'LL DO THELINDSAY LOHAN IMPRESSIONS AROUND
HERE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE PROBLEM ISN'T BERNIE SANDERSIS A CRAZY PANTS CUCKOO BIRD,
IT'S ALL WE'VE BECOME SOACCUSTOMED TO STAGE MANAGED,
FOCUS-DRIVEN CANDIDATES THATAUTHENTICITY COMES ACROSS AS
LUNACY.
>> HE MAY BE THE MOST UNUSUALPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WE'VE
SEEN IN A LONG TIME.
>> Jon: IF BY UNUSUAL YOU MEANHONESTLY REPRESENTING HIMSELF IN
HIS BELIEFS RATHER THAN PLAYINGA CYNICAL POLITICAL GAME, BUT IF
YOU MEAN MOST UNUSUAL CANDIDATEAS IN CRAZY, I CAN REFUTE THAT
ASSERTION IN THREE SIMPLEWORDS --
>> AHHH!
SHUCKY DUCKY!
>> Jon: SHUCKY DUCKY INDEED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
