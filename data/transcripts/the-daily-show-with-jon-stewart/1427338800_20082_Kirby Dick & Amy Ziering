>> WELCOME BACK, MY GUESTTONIGHT,
THE FILMMAKERS BEHIND THE NEWDOCUMENTARY THE HUNTING GROUND.
>> I WANT TO SINGLE OUTFRATERNITIES BECAUSE IT'S
ACTUALLY A MINORITY FRATERNITIES
BUT YOU INEVITABLY GETARE CERTAIN FRATERNITIES
WHERE THE SEXUAL ASSAULT ISREALLY RAMPANT,
WITHIN JUST SAY THE LAST FIVE TOTEN YEARS SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON
HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS.
>> SAE IS KNOWN AS A LOT OFPLACES AS SEXUAL ASSAULT
EXPECTED.
>> SEXUAL ASSAULT EXPECTED.
>> SAE, SEXUAL ASSAULTEXPECTED.
>> ARE THERE ANY PARTIES ORPLACES YOU GET WARNED NOT TO
GO.
>> SAE, SEXUAL ASSAULTEXPECTED.
>> THAT IS WHY THEY THREW INTHE RACIST THING, TO CLEAR
THEIR NAME FROM THE OTHERTHING.
>> PLEASE WELCOME KIRBY DICKAND AIM EAR ZIERING.
-- AMY ZIERING.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
(APPLAUSE)>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.
>> Jon: SO WHAT, ASTONISHINGWHEN YOU WATCH THIS, JUST AS
YOU SAW IN THAT CLIP, HERETHESE YOUNG GIRLS AND THERE
IS A SORT OF, AN AWARENESSTHAT THERE ARE CERTAIN
PLACES THAT IF THEY GO TO,THERE IS A HEIGHTENED DANGER.
BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE, WELL,IF EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS, AND
THIS IS THE COMMONKNOWLEDGE, HOW IS THIS PLACE
NOT SHUT DOWN?
HOW IS THIS SAE, NOT SHUTDOWN?
IN WHATEVER CAMPUS THIS IS.
>> I THINK WHAT WE FOUND ISPEOPLE DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE, OFTHIS CRIME  THE WAY IT'S
TAKING PLACE. THEY HAVE ALOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS.
THEY THINK IT'S JUST A DATEGONE BAD OR BAD HOOKUP OR,
YOU KNOW, MISCOMMUNICATION.
AND IT'S NOT.
WHAT WE FOUND IS ACTUALLY AHIGHLY CALCULATED
PREMEDITATED CRIME THAT CANBE PROLIFERATE ON
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE NOMECHANISM IN PLACE TO
ADJUDICATE AND INVESTIGATETHESE CRIMES AND PROSECUTE
THEM.
SO IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEMAND ARE YOU NOT TAKING
IT SERIOUSLY, IT CAN HAVE THESEEXPONENTIAL NUMBERS.
>> BUT I THINK A LOT OFPEOPLE ON CAMPUS DO KNOW.
THAT IS WHAT IS SO SHOCKING.
IF THE STUDENTS KNOW IT'S LIKETHAT THAN THE ADMINISTRATION,
PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATIONKNOW.
AND THEY'RE NOT SHUTTINGTHESE PLACES DOWN.
THAT IS WHAT IS SHOCKING
>> Jon: IS THERE A CERTAINTOLERANCE ON CAMPUSES
BECAUSE IT IS, AS YOU SAY,IT IS A PARTY ATMOSPHERE AT
TIMES.
THERE CAN BE "HE SAID, SHESAID", SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT
COME FORWARD, AND THEY DON'TWANT TO, BECAUSE OF
LIABILITY OR FOR WHATEVERREASONS, STEP INTO THAT MIX?
>> WELL, I THINK THAT'STRUE.
BUT I THINK BASICALLY THAT,YOU KNOW, THE COLLEGES ARE
PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUTTHEIR REPUTATION.
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVEANYTHING, ANYBODY TALKING
ABOUT RAPE ON THEIR CAMPUSAT ALL.
SO IF A RAPE HAPPENS, THEYWILL DO EVERYTHING TO SORT
OF DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROMIT I THINK THATS WHATS HAPPENING
>> SO WHEN PEOPLE REPORT,THEY DISSUADE THEM OR THEY DON'T
BELIEVE THEM OR THEY DECIDETHAT THEY, YOU KNOW, DON'T
REALLY WANT TO MOVE FORWARDWITH THIS CASE SO THEY DO
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TOENCOURAGE THE PERSON
REPORTING TO SORT OF JUSTMAKE IT GO AWAY.
>> Jon: IS THERE SOMETHINGINHERENT IN COLLEGE CAMPUSES?
IS THIS A FAR GREATER ISSUEOUT THERE THAN-- LET'S SAY
FOR 18 TO 24-YEAR-OLDS, ISTHERE A MUCH LARGER
EXISTENCE OF THIS TYPE OFATTACK ON CAMPUS THAN OFF
CAMPUS?
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMEDEBATE ON THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW, WE FEEL THATIT'S MORE DANGEROUS ON
CAMPUS THAN OFF CAMPUS.
THE THING IS, THESE ARE SOMEOF OUR MOST PRESTIGIOUS
INSTITUTIONS AND THEY SHOULDBE PROTECTING THE STUDENTS
THATS OUR FEELING
IT SEEMS LIKE NOW AND OBVIOUSLY
BEFORE THE FILM, THERESBEEN A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND
THERE ARE A LOT OF COLLEGES THATARE READDRESSING THERE AND
THE CONTROVERSY IS NOW THATTHEY HAVE COME DOWN TOO HARD
ON THOSE WHO HAVE BEENACCUSED, WHAT ARE YOUR
FEELING ON THAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S MORELIKELY THAT SOMEONE WHO IS
ASSAULTED WILL LEAVE SCHOOLTHAN THE PERPETRATOR WILL BE
KICKED  OUT OF SCHOOL.
SO NO, NOT AT ALL.
I MEAN JUST A VERY SMALLPERCENTAGE OF PERPETRATORS
ARE ACTUALLY KICKEDOUT OF SCHOOL.
THE NUMBERS ARE ASTONISHINGLYLOW.
>> ALSO IT'S STRANGE, ORSORT A PART OF RAPE CULTURE
TO BELIEVE THATFALSE-REPORTING IS A PROBLEM
WITH THIS ISSUE
ACTUALLY FALSE REPORTING OFRAPE IS EXACTLY THE SAME
AS ANY OTHER CRIME AND YOU DON'T
HEAR PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THEFALSE REPORTS OF CARJACKING,
OR THE 2% OF FALSE REPORTS OFBURGLARY BUT IT'S STATISTICALLY
NOT ANOMALOUS
SO THAT EVERYBODY HAS TOKEEP IN MIND.
>> Jon: THIS IS-- IT IS AREAL CRIME, AND PERHAPS THEY
ARE TREATING IT AS THOUGH ITIS A VIOLATION OF THE HONOR
CODE.
ITS ONE OF THOSE LIKEDON'T COPY OFF THAT GUY'S
PAPER, AN TRY NOT TO RAPEPEOPLE.
LIKE, ARE THEY-- ARE THEYJUST NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL
WITH WHAT IS A REALLYVICIOUS, VIOLENT CRIME?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THEYSHOULD BE PROTECTING THEIR
STUDENTS.
BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS, ISTHAT A PERSON IS MORE LIKELY
TO BE KICKED OUT OF SCHOOLFOR PLAGIARIZING THAN THEY
ARE FOR ASSAULTING SOMEONE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
NOW WHY WOULD YOU SAY THATIS, IS THAT AN EASIER THING
TO PROVE, ARE THEY LESSNERVOUS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
WALKING ON EGG SHELLS AROUNDIT?
THEY FEEL LIKE IF THEYLABEL YOU A PLAGERIZER
VERSUS LABELING YOU A RAPIST,OR CONVICTING YOU OF THAT
ITS NOT AS DAMAGING?
WHAT IS THE REALITY.
>> EXACTLY.
THEY WANT TO KEEP THESERAPES AS COVERED UP AS
POSSIBLE.
SO AS SOON AS THEY KICKSOMEBODY OUT BECAUSE OF RAPE
AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT,THEN PEOPLE WILL THINK THAT
THEY'RE THE RAPE SCHOOL.
THE REALITY IS THE RAPES AREHAPPENING AT ALL SCHOOLS.
AND AT  EPIDEMICPROPORTIONS
>> Jon: DOES SOMETHING LIKEWHAT HAPPENED AT UVA,
THERE WAS THIS  HUGE EXPOSE INROLLING STONE, AND THEN THAT
GETS DEBUNKED WHAT IS
THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT HAS ONWOMEN THAT MIGHT WANT TO COME
FORWARD, ON SCHOOLS THAT MAYWANT TO
CREATE A MORE RIGOROUSPROGRAM TO DEFEND AGAINST IT.
>> THERE IS A HUGECHILLECT EFFECT
BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO
REMEMBER ABOUT THE UVA, THATIS ABOUT BAD JOURNALISM AND
FAULTY REPORTING.
AND WE HAVE SEEN BADJOURNALISM AND FAULTY
REPORTING IN OTHER ISSUES.
>> Jon: I HAVEN'T SEEN BADJOURNALISM IN ANY OTHER
FIELD, IT'S REALLY JUSTTHIS ONE STORY.
>> BUT THAT THEY EVER BELOWSBACK ON THE ISSUE ITSELF.
WHY IN THIS CASE, WITHFAULTY JOURNALISM DOES ALL
OF A SUDDEN, THIS MUST NOT BEHAPPENING.
NO, THE REALITY IS IT ISHAPPENING.
AND AT REALLY THESE SCARY LEVELSTHAT IS WHERE OUR ENERGY AND
EMPHASIS IS.
>> Jon: DO YOU FEEL WHEN LIKETHEY SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YOU'RE SEEING IT NOW
THERE IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDSTAKING THIS MORE SERIOUSLY,
TOWARDS DEALING WITH IT AT ACOLLEGIATE LEVEL IN A MORE
SERIOUS WAY AND IN A WAYTHAT IS PROTECTING THE
VICTIMS?
>> SLOWLY WE SEE THATHAPPENING.
I MEAN TO BE FAIR, THERE AREA LOT OF PEOPLE IN
ADMINISTRATION WHO REALLYTAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY.
BUT THE PROBLEM S IT'S THECOLLEGE PRESIDENTS HAVEN'T
STEPPED FORWARD.
I MEAN THAT IS WHAT I WOULDLIKE TO SEE.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ACOLLEGE PRESIDENT STEP
FORWARD AND SAY HOLD MEACCOUNTABLE, I'M GOING TO
FIX THIS AND ALSO WHILE THEYARE DOING THAT, I WOULD LIKE
THEM TO APOLOGIZE TO THEDECADES OF SURVIVORS THAT
HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED ON THEIRCAMPUS AND THEIR CASES HAVE BEEN
MISHANDLED.
THAT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TOTHE SURVIVORS.
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO STEPFORWARD AND I THINK WHEN
THEY DO, THE PRESS WILLSUPPORT THEM.
RIGHT NOW YOU DO NOT SEECOLLEGE PRESIDENTS SPEAKING
UP.
>> Jon: YOU DO SEE OBVIOUSLYWHEN YOU WATCH FILMS, THE
EFFECTS OF IT ARE DEVASTATING
>> FOR A LIFETIME, IN MANYCASES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WE REALLY APPRECIATEIT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THE HUNTING GROUND,IN THEATERS NOW,
KIRBY DICK AND AMY ZIERING.
