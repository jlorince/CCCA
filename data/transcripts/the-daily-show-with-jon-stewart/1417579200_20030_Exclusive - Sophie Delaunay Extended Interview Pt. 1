>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THEEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DOCTORS
WITHOUT BORDERS PLEASE WELCOMETO THE PROGRAM SOPHIE DELAUNAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCHFOR JOINING US.
>> THANKS FOR INVITING ME.
>> Jon: NOW, DOCTORS WITHOUTBORDERS HAS BEEN WORKING IN
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT LANDS ANDCONDITIONS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.
AND I KNOW YOU HAD MANY DOCTORSWORKING IN LIBERIA, SIERRA
LEONE DURING THE EBOLA CRISIS.
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THATTHE EBOLA CRISIS IS NOW OVER
BECAUSE AMERICANS ARENO LONGER GETTING IT.
SO, I CAN ONLY ASSUME NOW THATALL OF YOUR DOCTORS HAVE LEFT
THE AREA AND IT IS NOLONGER A PROBLEM.
>> I WISH IT WAS THE CASE.
ACTUALLY. AND I WISH THEYWERE ALL PLAYING BOWLING
SOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE.
THE OUTBREAK SHOWS NO SIGNS OFABATING IN THE REGION.
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A DOWNWARDTREND IN MONROVIA.
THE CAPITOL OF LIBERIA.>> Jon: YES.
>> THERE IS STILL A NUMBER OFNEW CASES IN THE REGION.
SIERRA LEONE IS ACTUALLY AGREAT CONCERN. IT'S THE COUNTRY
THAT TAKES THE HIGHEST BURDEN OFCASES AT THIS MOMENT.
AND THE AID UNFORTUNATELY ISSTILL INSUFFICIENT AND
ILL ADAPTED TO -->> Jon: IT'S IN SUFFICIENT.
NOW HAVE GOVERNMENTS, NOW THENEWS MEDIA HAS MAYBE LESS FOCUS
ON IT HAVE YOU SEEN A DROP INTHE TYPE OF FUNDING THAT YOU
NEED FOR THAT SORT OF THING?HAVE GOVERNMENTS ABANDONED THE
EFFORT AND IT REALLY IS LEFTNOW TO JUST PURELY THE NGOS ON
THE GROUND, IS THAT WHAT ISHAPPENING?
>> WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHATIS HAPPENING.
IT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THEAID IS JUST NOW BEING EFFECTIVE
ON THE GROUND.
IT HAS TAKEN THREE MONTHS.
IT'S BEEN VERY VERYSLOW TO DEPLOY.
AND THE PLAN THAT WAS BUILT
IN THE BEGINNING OFSEPTEMBER IS YESTERDAY'S PLAN.
AND IT DOES NOT COINCIDE TOTODAY'S NEEDS.
SO NOT ONLY IS THERE STILL ANEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESPONSE.
BUT THE RESPONSE AS IT WASDESIGNED THREE MONTHS AGO IS NO
LONGER ADAPTIVE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IS NOT LONGERSUFFICIENT.
>> FOR EXAMPLE, AT THAT TIMETHERE WAS A HUGE NEED FOR
ADDITIONAL BEDS AND ISOLATIONUNITS IN MONROVIA, RIGHT.
IT'S NO LONGER THE CASE. THEREARE STILL CASES IN MONROVIA
BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH BEDS.
WHAT IS NEEDED AT THE MOMENT ISA VERY FLEXIBLE AND AGILE AIDE
SYSTEM THAT WOULD ADAPT TO THEEVOLVING NATURE
SYSTEM THAT WOULD ADAPT TO THEEVOLVING NATURE
OF THE OUTBREAK.
>> Jon: SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROMYOU IS YOU NEED MORE BEDS.
>> WE -- WE -- WE NEED A FEWMORE BEDS.
>> Jon: IT'S, IT'S --
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THATWHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE
CRISIS IT'S NOT JUST ONEELEMENT OF THE RESPONSE THAT IS
GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT'STHE FULL PACKAGE.
YOU NEED TO HAVE ISOLATIONUNITS, BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO
HAVE CONTACT TRACING,SURVEILLANCE, YOU NEED TO DO
EDUCATION AND SAFE BURIAL. ANDIT'S THIS COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE
THAT ALLOWS FOR A GOODRESPONSE.
>> Jon: AND YOU ALSO, YOU SEEMTO LEARN ANY ISSUE AT ANY PART
OF THE WORLD IN A WAY WE USETO FEEL LIKE OCEANS ISOLATE US
OR WESTERN IMPROVEMENTSAND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
ISOLATE US, THEY DON'T.
AND IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THESEPROBLEMS IN AREAS THEY WILL RISE
UP AND CAUSE ISSUES ALL AROUNDTHE WORLD.
>> THAT'S FOR SURE.
VIRUSES KNOWS NO BORDERS, SOIT'S CLEAR THAT --
>> Jon: ISN'T IT INTERESTING HOWVIRUSES AND DOCTORS,
NEITHER ONE. >> YES, EXACTLY.
>> Jon: INTERESTING. VERYINTERESTING.
>> SO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT --
>> Jon: WHICH ONE MUTATESFASTER, THAT'S MY QUESTION.
[LAUGHING]WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, WE HAD SOME DOCTORSHERE AND NURSES WHO -- I THINK
VERY COURAGEOUSLY WENT TO THESEAREAS WITH EBOLA AND WORKED WITH
PATIENTS AND CAME BACK.
AND WE DECIDED THE WAY TOCELEBRATE THAT, THE WAY WE DO IT
IN OUR COUNTRY IS WE SHUN THEM.
WE PUT THEM IN ISOLATION.
DID THAT CAUSE A CHILLING EFFECTON YOUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT
PEOPLE TO WORK?
>> IT DIDN'T HAVE AN EFFECT ONOUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AT THE
MOMENT BECAUSE OF COURSE YOUNEED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT
IN THE LONG RUN.
BUT IT CERTAINLY HAD AN IMPACTON THE VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE AT
THAT MOMENT IN THE FIELD.
>> Jon: OH REALLY?
>> AND WHO WERE SUPPOSED TORETURN IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.
SO, SOME OF THEM HAD TO CHANGETHEIR PLANS.
THEY HAD TO COME BACK EARLIERBECAUSE OF THESE MEASURES WHICH
OF COURSE HAS AN IMPACT ON OURABILITY TO RESPOND ON THE
GROUND.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLYIT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL STIGMA
ON THE PEOPLE AND BY JUSTEXACERBATING THE FEAR ON THE
PART OF THE POPULATION.CREATING A FALSE SENSE THAT
THESE PEOPLE CONSTITUTE A THREATWHEN WE KNOW IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS YOU'RE NOT ATRISK OF TRANSMITTING THE VIRUS.
>> Jon: WHAT IS A ROTATION FOR,IF SOMEONE WANTED TO INVOLVE
THEMSELVES IN DOCTORSWITHOUT BOARDERS.
WHAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL STINT?IS IT SOMETHING PEOPLE DO
IN A WEEK? IS IT A TWO MONTHROTATION,
IS IT SIX MONTHS? WHAT'S THEPLAN.
>> YEAH. WELL, USUALLY IT'SBETWEEN NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR.
>> Jon: OH, SO THIS IS, YOU MUSTMAKE A HUGE COMMITMENT.
>> BUT FOR THE EBOLA -- FOR THEEBOLA OUTBREAK IT'S VERY
DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THEDEMANDING NATURE OF THE WORK.
IT'S SO STRESSFUL, IT'S SO HIGHRISK.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND ALSO IT REQUIRES SUCHSPECIFIC SKILLS.
WE MANAGE ROTATIONS EVERY FIVETO SIX WEEKS FOR OUR
INTERNATIONAL STAFF.>> Jon: OH MY GOD, OKAY.
>> SO, IT'S A VERY DEMANDINGRECRUITMENT THAT IS PUT IN
PLACE. BUT LET'S NOT FORGETTHAT ACTUALLY 90% OF THE WORK,
WHICH IS THE LION'S SHARE OF THEWORK IS DONE BY OUR NATIONAL
COLLEAGUES ON THE GROUND.AND THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE
BEEN FIGHTING THIS OUTBREAKSINCE THE MONTH OF MARCH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO FOR THEM THERE IS NOROTATION.
>> Jon: IT'S JUST THEY'RE JUSTTHERE AND MAKING PROGRESS.
WELL, WILL YOU STICK AROUND FORA LITTLE BIT.
WE'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL.BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE POINT IS
STILL NEED RESOURCES,STILL NEED FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE
BECAUSE IT STILL HAS MUCH TO GOBEFORE IT'S --
>> LET'S NOT LET OUR GUARD DOWN.THAT'S FOR SURE.
Jon: ALRIGHT. STICK AROUND FOR ALITTLE BIT.
SOPHIE DELAUNAY.
