THE FOO FIGHTERS. HIS HBO SERIESWHICH HE CREATED AND DIRECTED IS
CALLED "FOO FIGHTERS,SONIC HIGHWAYS."
>> I LOOKED AT MY INTERVIEW WITHSTEVE LIKE
THE MESSAGE OF THIS ENTIREPROJECT.
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED BYSOMETHING.
MAYBE IT'S A RIVER THAT RUNSUNDERGROUND.
MAYBE IT'S WOODY GUTHRIE.
MAYBE IT'S CHUCK D.WHATEVER.
THAT CONVERSATION BECAME MYGOAL.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESEPEOPLE.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MUSIC.
BUT I WANT TO GET TO THIS.
>> Jon: NICE.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, DAVE GROHL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> YOU GOOD?
>> THANKS.
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD.
I KNOW IT'S HARD.
>> IT'S HARD BEING THIS OLD.
>> Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING.
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: I'M GOOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> I LOVE THIS.
>> Jon: THIS SERIES IS, IT'S --IT'S JUST WONDERFUL.
>> THANKS.
>> Jon: IT'S WONDERFUL.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: IT'S, AND IT'S OLDSCHOOL BUT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE
WAY WITHOUT THAT PATINA OF KINDOF GOOFY NOSTALGIA BUT
OF WHAT MADE THE MUSIC IN THECITIES YOU WENT TO SO VITAL.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU AVOIDEDTHAT TRAP BUT YOU DID.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW PART OFTHE -- PART OF THE IDEA OR THE
INTENTION WAS TOINSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION OF
MUSICIANS TO FALL INLOVE WITH MUSIC JUST AS
MUCH AS WE DID. SO AS MUCH AS --
AS MUCH AS I WAS DIGGING INTOTHE HISTORY OF AMERICAN MUSIC.
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHINGTHAT WOULD INSPIRE KIDS TODAY TO
WANT TO CONTINUE AND DO THE SAMETHING BY SHOWING THESE STORIES
THAT ARE TOTALLY HUMAN.
YOU KNOW.
LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT ANY OF WHAT-- ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE ONE
THING IN COMMON.
IT'S AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFETHEY WERE INSPIRED TO FOLLOW
THEIR DREAMS AND MAKESOMETHING OF IT.
WHETHER IT'S BUDDY GUY OR RICKNIELSEN OR CHUCK D OR IAN
MACKAYE OR WHATEVER IT ISAT SOME POINT IN THEIR
LIFE THEY CAUGHT THAT SPARK.
AND THEY WERE LIKE, OKAY THIS ISWHAT -- THIS IS ME AND THIS IS
WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR THEREST OF MY LIFE.
>> Jon: WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SOGOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU CAPTURED
IS IN EACH OF THOSEINTERACTIONS, IN EACH OF THOSE
CITIES THERE IS A MOMENT WHEREYOU ARE WITH THEM, WHERE YOU
FEEL THAT SPARK.
NOT ONLY IS IT ABOUT EXPLORINGIT BUT YOU FEEL THAT
ELECTRICITY. THERE IS A MOMENT.
AND MAYBE IT IS FOR MUSICIANS.
THAT FEELING OF WHEN YOU'RECONNECTED ON THE ARTISTIC LEVEL
AND SUDDENLY ITSTARTS TO CRACKLE.
>> YEAH, WELL, A LOT OF THE --ALSO, LIKE I INTERVIEWED ABOUT A
HUNDRED PEOPLE.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND WHEN I WOULD SIT DOWNTO INTERVIEW PEOPLE,
I DIDN'T HAVE QUESTIONS.
>> Jon: WHAT.
>> I DIDN'T HOLD QUESTIONS IN MYHAND.
>> Jon: YOU THINK I DO THAT.>> YEAH -- THINK --
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: I'M LIKE YOU, MAN!
I'M [BEEP] ROCK-N-ROLL.
>> YEAH, I KNOW YOU ARE.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT THEY BECAME, THEY WERECONVERSATIONS THAT THEN TURNED
INTO LESSONS BECAUSE THERE WERETHINGS THAT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
AND SO WHEN I WOULD TALKED TOSOMEONE ABOUT
THE BLUES OR JAZZ OR COUNTRY, ORNASHVILLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE WERE JUST THINGS IDIDN'T KNOW.
AND I WOULD SORT OF IMAGINEMYSELF AS THE VIEWER.
BECAUSE THEY WOULD SAY SOMETHINGTHAT WOULD TOTALLY BLOW ME AWAY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I WOULD JUST THINK, OKAYI HAVE TO USE THAT.
BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THATTHAT'S HOW IT WORKS, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: TURNING THAT INTO THECREATIVE PROCESS.
WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL HERE AS WELL,SO IN TERMS OF SONG WRITING.
SO, I'M SURE YOU HAVE IDEAS INYOUR HEAD AND THEY'RE FRAGMENTS
OF IDEAS AND MELODIESAND THINGS.
BUT YOU'RE SAVING THE LYRICS INTHESE CITIES FOR WHEN YOU'RE,
RIGHT BEFORE YOU'RE ABOUT TORECORD.
>> YEAH.
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE DID IS WEWENT TO EACH CITY FOR SIX DAYS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> FIRST DAY WE'D LOAD IN ALLTHE EQUIPMENT FIRST DAY.
THE NEXT DAY WE'D GET ALL THEMICROPHONES UP,
WE'D START RECORDING.BY THE END OF THAT DAY WE'D HAVE
A DRUM TRACK AND SOME GUITARSTUFF.
AND THEN AT NIGHT I WOULD GOINTERVIEW SOMEONE.
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY, DO SOMEMORE GUITAR STUFF, PERCUSSION.
THEN I'D GO INTERVIEW PEOPLE. IDID THAT FOR FOUR DAYS.
AND THEN ON THE FIFTH DAY I TAKEALL OF THOSE TRANSCRIPTS HOME.
AND I'D SIT DOWN, AND I'D PICKOUT WORDS AND SENTENCES AND
PHRASES AND I'D PUT THEM ON THISSIDE OF MY JOURNAL.
AND ON THIS SIDE OF THE JOURNALI HAD AN OUTLINE OF THE SONG.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I WOULD JUST CUT ANDPASTE. BECAUSE THE IDEA IS THAT
THE FINALE OF EACH EPISODE ISA PERFORMANCE OF THE SONG
THAT YOU'VE SEEN US PUTTINGTOGETHER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND WE PERFORM THE SONG.
YOU SEE THE LYRICS ON SCREEN.
AND YOU RECOGNIZE ALL OF THESELYRICS FROM REFERENCES THAT
YOU'VE JUST HEARD IN THEEPISODE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NO, NO, IT'S AREMARKABLE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE PROCESS WASSIX DAYS.
I'M JUST GONNA, ON THE SEVEN DAYI'M GOING TO ASSUME YOU RESTED.
[LAUGHING]
[ APPLAUSE ]AND THE RESPECT AND LOVE.
YOU KNOW, IT MADE ME YEARN FORTHAT TYPE OF CAMARADERIE.
COMEDIANS HAVE A CAMARADERIEAND YOU GO IN.
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEYNECESSARILY HAVE THOSE TYPES OF
REGIONAL FLAVORS ORTHE TYPES OF WITHIN MUSIC THAT
THE SHARING OF INFLUENCES.
YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE LIKE YEAH, ISAT DOWN WITH THE PROP GUY.
YOU KNOW, I'M A CARLIN GUY.
AND I, AND WE CAME UP WITHSOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. LIKE THAT
ABILITY TO COLLABORATE SEEMSSO INVITING AND SO EXCITING.
>> WELL COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIESARE REALLY IMPORTANT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE
EVERYTHING IS SO INTERCONNECTED.
IT USED TO BE THAT THESE PLACESWERE ISOLATED SOMEWHAT.
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE REGIONALSOUNDS, YOU KNOW.
THERE WERE REASONS WHY JAZZCOMES FROM NEW ORLEANS.
AND WHY THE BLUES MADE IT'S WAYTO CHICAGO, AND WHY NASHVILLE
BECAME A COUNTRY CAPITAL.AND WHY ALL OF THE MUSIC
FROM SEATTLE IS SO DEPRESSING.>> Jon: YEAH, YOUR MAP IS ALL
[BEEP] UP, BY THE WAY.>> YEAH, I DON'T.
>> Jon: IS THAT -->> DID I DO THAT RIGHT?
>> Jon: I THINK THAT WAS NEWZEALAND.
>> THAT'S ALASKA.>> Jon: THAT WAS ALASKA.
>> BUT NOW EVERYTHING IS SOINTER CONNECTED THAT ALL OF
THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BECOMESORT OF ONE BIG COMMUNITY.
AND ONE THING THAT I THINK IT'SIMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND IS ONE OF THE MOSTREWARDING THINGS ABOUT PLAYING
MUSIC IS DOING IT WITH OTHERPEOPLE. AND COMMUNITIES SUPPORT
EACH OTHER, LIKE THE PUNK ROCKCOMMUNITY WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IT'S LIKE, IT WASLIKE YOU AND YOUR BUDDY.
AND YOU NEVER REALLY IMAGINEDTHAT IT WOULD LEAVE YOUR CITY OR
YOUR LOCAL CLUB.
IT WAS JUST LIKE YOUR PALS.
AND YOU DID IT.
AND YOU HAD YOUR BAND PLAY WITHYOU.
AND YOU WOULD GO PLAY AT YOURFRIEND'S CLUB.
I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT,MIGHT IMAGINE THESE DAYS THAT
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
THAT YOU CAN JUST DO IT ON YOUROWN. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,
I THINK, TO WORK WITH OTHERPEOPLE.
BECAUSE YOU GET INSPIRED BYTHEM.
THEY PUSH YOU TO DO OTHERTHINGS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITYIS IMPORTANT.
>> Jon: AND I THINK THAT, BOYTHAT COMES THROUGH ACES IN
THE WHOLE PROGRAM. IT'S GREAT.AND THE NICE PART IS,
IT'S EIGHT CITIES NOW.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND THERE IS MORE THANTHAT, SO
I ASSUME THERE'S A SEASON TWOTHAT WILL GO --
>> THERE MIGHT BE A SEASON TWO.
>> Jon: I THINK I WOULD LIKETHAT VERY MUCH.
