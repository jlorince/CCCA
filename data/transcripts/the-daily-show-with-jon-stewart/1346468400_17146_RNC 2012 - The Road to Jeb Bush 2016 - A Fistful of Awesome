WE ARE ON ON A FRIDAY NIGHT T IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR US.
AND I'M-- LET'S JUST-- HERE'S THE-- I'M THE-- HERE'S THE FACT.
THIS HAS BEEN A LONG WEEK.
WE ARE ON THE ROAD, AWAY FROM OUR FAMILIES, THE PEOPLE HERE IN TAMPA HAVE BEEN VERY NICE, VERY
HOSPITABLE, BUT LET'S FACE FACTS.
IT IS HOTTER THAN A GORILLA'S ANUS.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR TO GORILLAS--  (LAUGHTER) -- THAT IS A DRY HEAT.
(APPLAUSE) THE WORST PART OF THIS TOWN-- THE WORST PART OF THIS TOWN, YOU CAN'T EVEN
SIT DOWN TO TAKE A BREAK FROM THE UNRELENTING HEAT BECAUSE THE MOMENT YOU FORM
ANY KIND OF LAP IN THE TAMPA-ST. PETE AREA, YOU ARE SET UPON BY THOSE WHO SEEK
TO DANCE UPON SAID LAP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: DO YOU KNOW-- DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET MONEY DOWN IN TAMPA THAT
DOES NOT HAVE BODY GLITTER ON IT?
(LAUGHTER) I WAS ADMITTEDLY A LITTLE DOWN LAST NIGHT, FROM BEING HERE THIS WHOLE WEEK, A
LITTLE DISSPIRITED.
AND THEN-- NO, NO-- AND THEN IT HAPPENED.
YES!
AMIDST THE TIRED RHETORIC,
EMPTY PLATITUDES AND OVERWROUGHT ATTACKS, A FISTFUL OF AWESOME!
(LAUGHTER) EMERGED IN THE NIGHT WHERE IT SPENT 12 MINUTES ON THE MOST IMPORTANT NIGHT OF MITT
ROMNEY'S LIFE, YELLING AT A CHAIR.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES.
AND OH HOW THE OUTLAW JOSSIE WAILED.
>> HOW DO YOU HANDLE-- HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT?
I MEAN WHAT DOW SAY TO PEOPLE?
DO YOU JUST-- YOU KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE-- PEOPLE ARE WONDERING-- YOU DON'T-- YOU
DON'T-- OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE MOST JOY I'VE GOTTEN FROM AN OLD MAN.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN-- THIS IS-- MORE,
GIVE ME MORE.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT UP,
IT'S MY TURN.

>> Jon: I'M HERE TO LEND MY SUPPORT TO MITT ROMNEY IN HIS CRUCIAL HOUR.
WILL YOU NOT SILENCE ME,
INVISIBLE BARACK OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER) I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, BACK WHERE WE WORK AT THE DAILY SHOW ON
THE WEST SIDE OF HE'LL KITCHEN IN NEW YORK CITY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR TO SEE AN OLD MAN YELLING AT AN INANIMATE OBJECT.
(LAUGHTER) BUT RARELY IS THAT OBJECT ON STAGE AT A NATIONAL POLITICAL CONVENTION.
AND ALMOST NEVER IS THAT OLD
