>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS WE HAVE SEEN, LAST WEEK, VERYUPSETTING, THE SUPREME COURT
CONSERVATIVE WING, THERE WASONE JUSTICE IN THE PROCESS
SEEMED TO NOT JUSTDISAPPOINT BUT TO ACTUALLY
BREAK.
>> SCALIA SAID WE SHOULDREALLY START CALLING THIS
LAW SCOTUSCARE.
>> THE OPINION SHOWYPROFUNDITIES ARE OFTEN
PROFOUNDLY INCOHERENT.
>> THE SUPREME COURT HASDESCENDED TO THE MYSTICAL
APHORISMS OF THE FORTUNECOOKIEST.
>> CALLING THE COURT'S REASONINGABSURD, INTERPRETIVE JIGGERY
POKERY AND PURE APPLESAUCE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU KISS YOUR MOTHERWITH THAT MOUTH?
JIGGERY POKERY, APPLESAUCE?
SIR!
LET US NOT SAY THINGS WE CANNEVER TAKE BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
OR EVEN UNDERSTAND.
(LAUGHTER)
IT IS SO INTERESTING.
IF YOU LOOK IN THE OLD MANDICTIONARY THAT SCALIA IS
APPARENTLY USING, THEDEFINITION OF JIGGERY POKERY
IS PURE APPLESAUCE.
AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOWTHIS, PURE APPLESAUCE IS
DEFINED AS SASSAFRAS WHATWON'T BE STOOD FOR.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH IS DEFINED AS "OOHHH"!
I THINK WE FOUND SCALIA'S TELL.
THE CRANKINESS OF HIS INSULTSRUNS-- DO YOU LIKE THAT?
THE CRANKINESS OF HIS INSULTS--
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I ASSUME HE WOULD RULEIN FAVOR OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
(LAUGHTER)
THE CRANKINESS OF SCALIA'SINSULTS RUN INVERSE TO HIS
INTELLECTUAL CONSISTENCY.
HERE IS A SPECIFIC PROBLEMHE HAD WITH THE GAY EQUALITY
RULING.
>> SCALIA SAID TODAY'SDECISION IGNORES THE WILL OF
THE VOTERS TO IMPOSE THEJUDGEMENT OF AN ELITE FEW.
A SELECT, PATRICIAN, HIGHLYUNREPRESENTATIVE PANEL OF
NINE.
>> Jon: BECAUSE UNLIKE THEJUDGES SHOULD NEVER OVERTURN
THE WILL OF THE VOTERS -- IT'SCORE SCALIA PRINCIPLE.
UNLESS THE VOTERS WILL WAS FOROBAMACARE.
WHICH HE WAS NGLAD TO TRY TODESTROY THE DAY BEFORE.
OR IF THE VOTERS WANTED TO LIMITCAMPAIGN FINANCE SPENDING.
THEN HE HAD NO PROBLEM TO TELLPEOPLE TO [BLEEP] OFF AT THAT
TIME.
OR IF THE VOTERS WANT AVOTING RIGHTS ACT AND KEPT
ELECTING CONGRESSES THAT RENEWEDITS ANTI-RACIAL BIAS PROVISIONS,
AGAIN AND AGAIN BY HUGE SUPERMAJORITIES.
THEN NOT ONLY DID SCALIAOVERTURN IT, HE HAD NO PROBLEM
DISMISSING  ALL THOSE ELECTEDREPRESENTATIVES MOTIVES FOR
PASSING RACIAL JUSTICELEGISLATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.
>> WHENEVER A SOCIETY ADOPTSARACIAL ENTITLEMENTS, IT IS
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OFTHEM TO THE NORMAL POLITICAL
PROCESSES.
I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT IT WILLBE REENACTED IN PERPETUITY.
UNLESS, UNLESS A COURT CANSAY IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH
THE CONSTITUTION.
>> Jon: UNLESS A COURT SAYSTHAT?
OR THE SELECT PATRITIONHIGHLY UNREPRESENTATIVE
PANEL OF NINE TEARING OURCOUNTRY APART.
OR YOU MUST NOT MEAN --
YOU MUST NOT MEANTHAT COURT, YOU MEAN THE
HEARTLAND 5-4 MAJORITYCONSERVATIVE COURT THAT
STILL TAKES COUNSELLING FROMTHE FOUNDER'S UNDERGROUND
BRAIN JAR FARM.
OH BRAIN OF MADISON ANDJEFFERSON, WHAT DID YOU MEAN
BY EQUAL AGAIN?
HOW ABOUT WHEN SCALIA HANDEDDOWN V GORE WITHOUT
PRECEDENT.
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN THAT TOVOTERS WHO FELT THEIR VOICE
WAS BEING UNCEREMONIOUSLYTAKEN AWAY.
>> GEE, I REALLY DON'T WANTTO GET IN-- THIS IS, GET
OVER IT, IT'S SO OLD BY NOW.
>> Jon: ANYTIME THE PEOPLEAGREE WITH ME THEY SHOULD
HAVE THE FINAL SAY, IT'SCALLED DEMOCRACY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I FEEL BADFOR SCALIA, I REALLY DO.
HIS MODERN-DAY DIOGENEWANTS EVERYTHING TO GO HIS
WAY ALL THE TIME FOREVER.
THEN WE HAD TO GO AND GIVEHIM ONE OF THE WORST FRIDAYS
IN HIS LIFE.
SO IN A GESTURE OF EMPATHY,WE PRESENT THIS ODE TO ANTONIN
SCALIA AND HIS NO GOOD, VERY BADDAY.
