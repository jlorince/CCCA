AS DIPLOMATS LOOK FORWARD TO
GETTING HOME EARLY FROM
WORK.
PICKING THEIR CHILDREN UP
FROM SCHOOL, THANKS TO THE
ANNUAL AHMADINEJAD SPEECH
RITUAL KNOWN AS THE RUNNING
OF THE BULL [BLEEP] NO,

(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE PERFORMANCE OF
SPONGE NUT CRAZY PANT AS
SIDE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE U.N. HAD MORE
PRESSING ISSUES TO DISCUSS.
AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW
THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT
ONGOING PROPERTY LINE
DISPUTE IN THE AREA WHAT
EVERYBODY CALLS PALESTINE
CALLS ISRAEL AND WHAT
EVERYBODY BUT ISRAEL CALLS
PALESTINE.
SO FOR I GUESS AROUND THE
PAST 6,000 YEARS, THESE TWO
PARTIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO
SETTLE THE ZONING
DISAGREEMENT THE
OLD-FASHIONED WAY,
PERSISTENT BLOODSHED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SINCE THIS METHOD
HAS PROVEN SOMEWHAT
INCONCLUSIVE THE PARTIES
FROM TIME TO TIME SEEK AN
ALTERNATIVE, PARDON THE PUN,
UNORTH-- UNORTH DOX-- UNORTHODOX
METHOD TO ACHIEVE THEIR
GOALS.
>> THE PALESTINIANS HAVE
FLOWN A SYMBOLIC CHAIR TO
THE UNITED FACIALS AHEAD OF
NEXT WEEK'S GENERAL
ASSEMBLY.
THAT'S WHEN PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY PRESIDENT ABBAS
PLANS TO MAKE A BID FOR U.N.
MEMBERSHIP.
>> Jon: THAET, APPARENTLY
THE UNITED NATIONS IS BRING
YOUR OWN MOTHER [BLEEP]
CHAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE U.N. PROVIDES
THE TRANSLATORS, YOU PROVIDE
THE CHAIR, AND HEAD PHONE
RENTALS ARE $3.
(LAUGHTER)
SMALL PRICE TO PLAY TO STEAL
AND KILL WITH DIPLOMATIC
IMMUNITY.
OH, REALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
OH REALLY.
(APPLAUSE)
BELIEVE ME, YOU GET ONE OF
THEM DIPLOMATIC LICENCE
PLATES [BLEEP] RED LIGHTS.
(LAUGHTER)
THE CHAIRS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
AN IMPRESSIVE PART OF THE
U.N..
THE TURKS HAVE THEIR
OTTO-MAN EMPIRE.
SWEDEN BROUGHT THEIR
NATIONAL CHAIR, THE GLURKE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND UNASSEMBLED PILE OF WOOD
AND OF COURSE --
(APPLAUSE)
>> AUSTRALIAN RELIES ON
POUCHIE, THE WORLD'S MOST
PATIENT KANGAROO.
POUCHIE.
JOINING THE U.N. ISN'T AS
SIMPLE AS JUST BRINGING A
CHAIR.
>> WHEN I RECEIVED AN-- FROM
A STATE FOR AN ADMISSION
INTO THE UNITED NATIONS, I
REVIEW ALL THESE TECHNICAL
ISSUES, WHETHER THIS IS IN
PROPER FORM.
>> Jon: REALLY THERE IS AN
APPLICATION PROCESS FOR
JOINING THE U.N. WHO DID
NORTH KOREA USE AS A
REFERENCE ON THEIR
APPLICATION?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AND SYRIA, A COUNTRY
WHO HAS BEGUN FIRING AT ITS
OWN PEOPLE, THEY MUST HAVE
HAD GOOD TEST SCORES
OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
LET THEM IN.
ALTHOUGH I GUESS ONCE YOU
GET TENURE.
YOU KNOW, THE REAL ISSUE
ISN'T REALLY THE CHAIR OR
THE APPLICATION, AS WITH ANY
GOOD CO-OP, IT'S GETTING
PAST THAT ONE HARD ASS ON
THE CO-OP BOARD WHO ALWAYS
CHEWS PEOPLE DOWN, WITHOUT
DOESN'T LIKE DOGS BUT HE HAS
TWO GREAT DAINS BECAUSE HE
WAS GRANDFATHERED IN.
(LAUGHTER)
MADE ME SO MAD.
SO ARE THE PALESTINIANS IN?
>> PEACE WILL NOT COME
THROUGH STATEMENTS AND
RESOLUTIONS AT THE UNITED
NATIONS.
ULTIMATELY THE ISRAELIS AND
PALESTINIANS, NOT US, WHO
MUST REACH AGREEMENT ON
ISSUES THAT DIVIDE THEM.
>> Jon: SO THANK YOU FOR
YOUR INTEREST OUR BUILDING.
(LAUGHTER)
AND PLEASE COME BACK ONCE SU
HAVE A LETTER OF
RECOMMENDATION FROM YOUR
MORTAL ENEMY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> ALSO WE'RE GOING TO NEED
PAY STUBS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THERE YOU GO, PALESTINE,
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SETTLE
YOUR DIFFERENCES WITH ISRAEL.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE AN IDEA, MAYBE THIS
WILL MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE,
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT A
SPELLING CHANGE?
NICE.
GOOD.
GOOD.
WAIT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S ENOUGH.
YEAH!
