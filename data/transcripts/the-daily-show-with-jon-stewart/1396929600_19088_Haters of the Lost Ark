>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]TWO THINGS.
TWO THINGS.
TWO THINGS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THEAMERICAN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
ONE IT IS FULL OF THE COUNTRY'SKINDEST AND MOST THOUGHTFUL
PEOPLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND TWO,
>> HOLLYWOOD FOR YEARS HASUNDERESTIMATED HOW MUCH WE WANT
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEBIBLE AND RELIGION.
>> ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY ISJUST FINE IN THE ENTERTAINMENTINDUSTRY.
>> WHY DOESN'T HOLLYWOOD CHURNOUT MORE RELIGIOUS MOVIES.
>> Jon: THAT'S HOW YOU SHOWRESPECT FOR RELIGION.
GET IN THERE AND CHURN SOME(bleep) OUT.
HAVE YOU HEARD THE GOOD NEWSBECAUSE THIS WEEK'S TOP ACTION
HEROES AT THE BOX OFFICE ARE NOTONLY CAPTAIN AMERICA BUT ALSO
CAPTAIN SUMERIA.
IN TWO WEEKS OF RELEASE, THENOAH MOVIE HAS EARNED NEARLY
$200 MILLION WORLDWIDE, SORELIGIOUS FILM GOERS MUST
HAVE SOMETHING TO CHEERABOUT.
>> IT IS AWFUL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: DID NOT SEE THATCOMING.
WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
>> THEY CLAIM THAT THE MOVIE ISUNFAITHFUL TO ONE OF BIBLES MOST
FAMOUS TALES.
>> THERE'S DEFINITELY ARTISTICLIBERTIES TAKEN IN THE FILM.
THIS MOVIE IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY.
[ LAUGHTER ][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: SO YOU ARE TELLING METHAT THE MOVIE ABOUT A MAN WHO
LIVES TO 950 AND LOADS TWO OFEVERY ANIMAL ONTO A 300 CUBIT
LONG BOAT, BY THE WAY ACUBIT IS FROM HERE TO HERE,
300 OF THESE BAD BOYS YEAHTHAT'S GOING TO KEEP THE LIONS
AWAY FROM THE DELICIOUS ZEBRAS.LISTEN. YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT
FILM WON'T QUALIFY TO SUBMIT INTHE DOCUMENTARY CATEGORY.
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
I GUESS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TOSAY IS THIS VERSION IS A
BIT DIFFERENT FROM WHATIS IN THE BIBLE.
BUT HOW DIFFERENT COULD NOAH BE?
>> IT DOESN'T USE THE WORD GOD,NOT ONCE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
FILM.
>> NOT REFERENCE AT ALL TO GODIN THE ENTIRE MOVIE.
>> Jon: THAT IS WEIRD BECAUSEIF THERE'S NO GOD IN THE MOVIE
WHO IS TELLING HIM TO BUILD THEBOAT?
TO GO ALL WATERWORLD WE BOUGHT AZOO ON EVERYONE?
>> THE MOVIE DOES USE THE WORDCREATOR IN REFERENCING GOD.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BIBLEUSES THE WORD GOD. HIS DOG?
>> THE MOVIE DOES USE THE WORDCREATOR IN REFERENCING GOD.
THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT THEBIBLE USES THE WORD GOD.
>> Jon: YEAH, I MEAN CREATORTHAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING.
AND WHILE THE BIBLE DOESN'TACTUALLY EVER USE THE WORD GOD
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN ENGLISH. MYGUESS IS WE'RE NOT REALLY UP FOR
THAT DISCUSSION. BUT THEQUESTION IS, IS CREATOR ENOUGH?
I MEAN CREATOR COULD BE XENU,COULD BE TYLER THE CREATOR,
COULD BE THE MASTERBUILDER. IF ONLY SOMEONE IN
THE NOAH FILM, IF ONLY SOMEONEIN THIS FILM LIKE NOAH'S SON
HAM SAID SOMETHING CLEAR ANDUNEQUIVOCAL LIKE QUOTE
"MY FATHER SAYS THERE CAN BE NOKING. THE CREATOR IS GOD."
THAT WOULD CLARIFY.
OH RIGHT THEY DIDN'T SEE THE(bleep) MOVIE.
WHAT ELSE DID THEY PUT INTHIS MOVIE THAT ISN'T IN THEBIBLE?
>> NOAH GETS DRUNK.
NOAH HAS SOME VERY DARK MOMENTS.
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT SOME EARLYTEST AUDIENCES WERE NOT EXCITED
ABOUT.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T SLANDER NOAHLIKE THAT.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?GENESIS CHAPTER 9, VERSE 21.
WHY DON'T YOU REMEMBER ANY OFTHIS STUFF?
YOU DID READ THE SAME BIBLE ASTHE REST OF US, RIGHT?
>> MY MEMORIES OF THE STORY OFNOAH ARE VERY DIFFERENT.
I HAD THIS CHILDREN'S BIBLE WHENI WAS A KID AND IT ALL THESE
ILLUSTRATIONS IN IT. THEY HADTHE TWO ANIMLS WALKING SIDE BY
SIDE AND THE SUN COMESOUT AND EVERYBODY LIVES HAPPILY
EVER AFTER.
>> Jon: EVERYBODY?
NOBODY LIVES!
EVERYBODY IS ONE FAMILY AND TWOOF EVERY ANIMAL.
EVERYBODY ELSE DROWNED.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY KOALA BEARSDROWNED?
[AUDIENCE BOOS] TALK TO GOD.
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THEY MADEAN OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE MOVIE.
THE OLD TESTAMENT HAS STUFF INIT THAT YOU DON'T
NECESSARILY WANTFILMMAKERS TO TALK ABOUT.
JUST STICK TO JESUS AND YOUCAN'T GO WRONG.
>> SON OF GOD IS GENERATING ALOT OF HEAT BECAUSE JESUS IS
UMM SO SEXY.
I'M GAWKING AT THIS ACTOR ANDI'M THINKING OH MY GOSH,
I'M GAWKING AT JESUS.>> IS THIS PROPER?
>> AND THEN I FELT KIND OF DIRTYAND CREEPY, RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: DON'T WORRY I'M SURE
SEXY JESUS FORGIVES YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
