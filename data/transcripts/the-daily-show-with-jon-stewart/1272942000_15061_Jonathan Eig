AMERICA'S -- CAPTURED AMERICA'S MOST WANTED GANGSTER WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JONATHAN EIG.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "GET CAPONE".
I THINK IT SHOULD BE CALLED EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT AL CAPONE IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
-S EVERYTHING I THOUGHT -- HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE.
>> NOT SO MUCH.
>> Jon: ELLIOT NECESSARY WAS HIS NEMESIS THAT HERE YOLKY -- HEROICALLY BROUGHT HIM DOWN
SINGLE HANDEDLY.
>> NOT THE GUY.
>> Jon: WHY DO I THINK THAT?
>> YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING A LOT OF MOVIES.
>> Jon: I ENJOY MOVIES.
>> THE STORY OF AL CAPONE HAS BEEN INFLATED BY JOURNALISTS ANT THE MOVIES AND TV SHOWS.
IT HAS TAKEN OFF IN WAYS THAT MAKE NO SENSE.
IT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE THAT HE CREATED THE VALENTINE'S MASSACRE.
THERE'S NO WAY HE DOES THAT AND NO WAY HE LEAVES MORAN ALIVE.
>> Jon: HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.
>> WASN'T EVEN CLOSE.
>> Jon: THE GOOSENBERG BOYS WERE THERE.
>> THEY HAD MORE TO DO WITH IT THAN --
>> Jon: I READ THE (bleep) BOOK.
YEAH, YEAH LOOK AT THE EYES WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
DID AL CAPONE ACTUALLY HAVE A SCAR ON HIS FACE?
TWONCH.
>> Jon: GOOD.
HE DID WORK THAT OUT.
HOW ABOUT THE ELLIOT NECESSARY IS THAT BECAUSE OF MOVIE "THE
UNTOUCHABLES" OR WAS IT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE WRITE BEING NECESSARY AND CREATING THE LEGEND?
>> HE WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE GERALDO IN HIS DAY.
HE LOVED THE PRESS.
HE DIDN'T DO MUCH.
HE LOVED THE MEDIA.
HE GAVE GREAT INTERVIEWS.
HE WAS AN IVY LEAGUE GRAD SO HE WAS FUN TO TALK TO.
HE WENT ON, HAD HIS CAREER AND WENT BACK TO ANONYMITY BUT BEFORE HE DIED A GHOST WRITER
SPONSOR IT INTO MAGIC AND HE WAS THE SHERIFF OF NOTINGHAM.
THAT GOT TURNED INTO THE TV SHOW WITH ROBERT STACK AND KEVIN COSTNER AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON.
>> Jon: YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT HOLLYWOOD HAS DISTORTED HISTORICAL EVENT IN A WAY THAT
DOES A DISSERVICE TO THE ACTUAL INCIDENT.
SIR, I MUST TELL YOU STAND DOWN.
DO YOU KNOW IF OBI ONE GETS MORE POWERFUL AFTER HE IS STRUCK DOWN OR IS THAT ALSO MYTHOLOGY?
>> I'M GOING THERE.
>> Jon: YOU FIND THIS GUY A JOHNSON.
HE IS A GUY WITH KNOLL EGO YET A TREMENDOUS WORK ETHIC.
HE IS THE GUY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROSECUTION OF AL AL CAPONE ON THE -- THE WAY THEY GOT HIM
INCOME TAX EVASION.
>> GEORGE THOMPSON HE WORKS FOR HOOVER.
IT'S HOOVER WHO WANTS THIS GUY.
HE WANTS TO CRACK DOWN ON PROHIBITION.
HE GOES AFTER CAPONE A SYMBOLIC MOVE TO SHOW THE PUBLIC HE IS TOUGH ON CRIME.
GEORGE JOHNSON IS THE GUY IN CHARGE AND THEY SETTLE ON TAX EVASION.
THEY COULDN'T PROVE ANYTHING AGAINST HIM.
FOR ALL HIS CRIMES, AND HE COMMITTED MANY, THEY COULDN'T PROVE ANY OF THEM.
>> Jon: HE DID MURDER,
TERRORIZE AND HOW DOES HE END UP WITH 11 YEARS ON TAX EVASION AND THE TRIAL WAS A SHAM.
>> IT WAS A SHAM.
HE GOT RAILROADED.
NO ONE HAD GOTTEN MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR YEARS FOR THAT.
HE COMPLAINED ABOUT IT.
THE GOVERNMENT WAS WILLING TO SETTLE FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS BUT THE JUDGE THREW IT OUT.
>> Jon: DID HE A PLEA BARGAIN BUT IT DIDN'T STICK.
>> THEY HAD A DEAL.
IT WAS CEMENTED.
THE PRESIDENT SIGNED OFF ON IT BUT THE JUDGE THREW IT OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE AND DEMANDED A TRIAL.
>> Jon: WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PLEA BARGAIN, CAPONE EVER SAY N'YAH, SEE, I TAKE THAT PLEA
BARGAIN, SEE?
THESE COPPERS ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE ME LIFE SEE?
>> HE DID SAY THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: SOME OF WHAT I KNOW ABOUT AL CAPONE.
>> THAT'S THE ONE PART.
>> Jon: IS CORRECT.
THAT SEEMS FAIR.
ALL THESE STORIES END THE SAME WAY.
HE DISGUISE AND NOBODY SHOWS -- HE DIES AND NOBODY SHOWS UP TO THE FUNERAL.
DO THESE GUYS IN THIS TIME UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHERE THEY ARE GOING?
DO THEY HAVE A SENSE OF THEIR OWN MORTALITY AS THIS IS MOVING PERIOD TO?
>> CAPONE LOVED THE CELEBRITY.
HE LOVED THE FACT THAT HE BECAME FAMILIOUS.
HE REALIZE -- FAMOUS.
HE DIED MISERABLE REALIZING HE CHAINED HIS MOTHER AND WIFE AND SON.
HE DIED ALONE AND NOBODY SHOWED UP FOR HIS FUNERAL.
I THINK HE RECOGNIZED THE PLIGHT HE BROUGHT ON HIMSELF.
>> Jon: RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S THE LESSON OUT THERE FOR THE KIDS.
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU ARE GOING TO COMMIT THESE CRIMES, SERIOUSLY SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
[LAUGHTER]
GREAT "GET CAPONE" BOOK IS ON THE||||
