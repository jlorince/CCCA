>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST GERARD BUTLER HAS A NEW FILM "FACING MAVERICKS." IT'S A FILM FOLLOWING SARAH PALIN AROUND.
(LAUGHTER) WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT LADY?
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST NIGHT'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN BOCA RATON, FLORIDA, WHICH IS SPANISH FOR "RAT'S MOUTH."
(LAUGHTER) AND YIDDISH FOR "HEAVEN'S WAITING ROOM." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS THE THIRD AND-- THANK
GOD-- FINAL DEBATE BETWEEN BARACK OBAMA AND MITT ROMNEY.
TO TOPIC, FOREIGN POLICY.
BAD NEWS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAUSE --
>> IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, HE'S OUR WORST AT FOREIGN POLICY.
>> THIS IS A VERY WEAK ILL-CONCEIVED FOREIGN POLICY.
EVERY PLACE YOU LOOK IS FAILURE.
>> THE JIMMY CARTER YEARS LOOK LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS COMPARED TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS COMMUNICATED WEAKNESS.
>> Jon: WEAKNESS IN FOREIGN POLICY!
OBAMA IS WEAKER THAN COOLIDGE IN FOREIGN POLICY!
WEAKER THAN POLK!
WEAKER THAN PRESIDENT FLINCHINGTON J. CRAPHISPANTS.
(LAUGHTER) AS YOU KNOW, THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN UNITED STATES HISTORY WHO EVER HAD HIS WALLET STOLEN BY A BABY.
(LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T HEAR AS MUCH ABOUT OLD PRESIDENT CRAPHISPANTS.
(LAUGHTER) BUT GIVEN OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY RECORD, THIS DEBATE IS GOING TO BE A BLOODBATH.
>> I CONGRATULATE HIM ON TAKING OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN.
DRONES ARE BEING USED IN DRONE STRIKES AND I SUPPORT THAT ENTIRELY.
AND FEEL THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT.
I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE SAME POINT THE PRESIDENT MADE.
I FELT THE SAME AS THE PRESIDENT DID.
I SUPPORTED HIS ACTION THERE.
ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO HAVE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I THINK ROMNEY'S LEANING OBAMA!
(LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY ROMNEY IS ONE OF THIS YEAR'S COVETED SWING VOTERS.
LOOK, HOW CLOSELY DID MITT ROMNEY ALIGN HIMSELF WITH WHAT HAD, I GUESS UP UNTIL LAST NIGHT, BEEN THE WORST FOREIGN
POLICY EVER?
LISTEN TO THESE GUYS DUET ON SYRIA.
>> I BELIEVE THAT ASSAD MUST GO.
>> ASSAD HAS TO GO.
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE OUR MILITARY INVOLVED IN SYRIA.
>> FOR US TO GET MORE ENTANGLED MILITARILY IN SYRIA IS A SERIOUS STEP.
>> SO THE RIGHT COURSE FOR US IS WORKING THROUGH OUR PARTNERS --
>> -- IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR PARTNERS --
>> -- TO IDENTIFY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WITHIN SYRIA.
>> MOBILIZING THE MODERATE FORCES.
>> ORGANIZE THEM.
>> HELPING THE OPERATION ORGANIZE.
>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE --
>> MAKING ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN --
>> THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ARMS --
>> -- ARMS ?
>> THE WRONG HANDS.
>> TO HURT US DOWN THE ROAD.
(.
>> (BOTH TOGETHER) THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WOW, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
ON FOREIGN POLICY IT APPEARS THAT ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS THIS ONE MODEL.
I MEAN, AT LEAST WE STILL GET OUR CHOICE OF COLOR BUT IT'S THE SAME MODEL!
(LAUGHTER) WHAT THE HELL'S ROMNEY UP TO?
THE WHOLE DEBATE WAS A TOUR OF BIZARRO LAND.
HERE'S ROMNEY ON THE AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL.
>> WELL, WE'RE GOING TO BE FINISHED BY 2014 AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT WE'LL MAKE SURE WE BRING OUR TROOPS OUT BY THE END
OF 2014.
>> Jon: 2014 WITHDRAWAL DATE NO MATTER WHAT!
THAT'S BARACK OBAMA'S PLAN!
(LAUGHTER) THE WEIRD PART IS, IT NEVER USED TO BE ROMNEY'S.
>> ANNOUNCING A WITHDRAWAL DATE, THAT WAS WRONG.
THE TALIBAN MAY NOT HAVE WATCHES BUT THEY DO HAVE CALENDARS.
>> Jon: CALENDARS?
I MEANT COLANDERS.
THEY HAVE COLANDERS.
(LAUGHTER) AND DID I SAY WITHDRAWAL DATE WAS WRONG?
I MEANT RIGHT!
(LAUGHTER) HOW ABOUT IRAQ?
>> GOVERNOR ROMNEY, WAS THE WAR IN IRAQ A GOOD IDEA WORTH THE COST IN BLOOD AND TREASURE WE HAVE SPENT?
>> IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION TO GO INTO IRAQ.
I SUPPORTED IT AT THE TIME; I SUPPORT IT NOW.
>> Jon: BUT DO YOU SUPPORT IT -- (LAUGHTER).
NOW?
>> WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER IRAQ.
WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER AFGHANISTAN.
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT COURSE FOR US.
>> WELL, I GUESS THAT'S NOT A FLIP-FLOP SO MUCH AS A PRINCIPLED RECOGNITION BECAUSE OF THE IRAQ WAR'S CURRENT UNPOPULARITY.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT?
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN THOSE ARE YESTERDAY'S WARS.
IT'S TOMORROW'S WAR THAT COUNTS AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS BEEN VOCIFEROUS ABOUT LO THESE PAST 18 MONTHS IT IS
HIS UNCOMPROMISING BELIEF THAT IT'S TIME TO RATTLE OUR SABERS AT IRAN.
>> THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD COMMUNICATED TO IRAN THAT WE ARE PREPARED, THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING MILITARY
OPTIONS, THEY'RE NOT JUST ON THE TABLE, THEY ARE IN OUR HANDS.
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE BUILT CREDIBLE THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION.
WHEN THEY SEE OUR MILITARY OPTION IN OUR HAND, A POSSIBLE BLOCKADE OR AERIAL STRIKES THEY RECOGNIZE WE MEAN BUSINESS.
>> Jon: WE MEAN BUSINESS MOTHER (BLEEP)!
(LAUGHTER) BLOCKADE!
AERIAL STRIKES.
PEW!
PEW!
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU, IRAN!
ALL RIGHT.
SO HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO CONTRAST OBAMA'S APPEASEMENT THROUGH DIPLOMACY WITH YOUR FREEDOM THROUGH STRENGTH.
>> IT'S ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR MISSION IS IN IRAN AND THAT IS TO DISSUADE
IRAN FROM HAVING A NUCLEAR WEAPON THROUGH PEACEFUL AND DIPLOMATIC MEANS.
WE WANT A PEACEFUL PLANET.
WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TONE JOY THEIR LIVES AND KNOW THEY'LL HAVE A BRIGHT AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE AND NOT BE AT WAR.
I WANT TO SEE PEACE.
(LAUGHTER)
