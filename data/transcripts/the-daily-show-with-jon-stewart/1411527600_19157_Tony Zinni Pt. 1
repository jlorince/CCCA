HOW AMERICA CAN WIN OR LOSEOFF THE BATTLEFIELD."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, GENERAL TONY ZINNI!
GENERAL! HOW ARE YOU, SIR?THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.
♪♪(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: SIR, I AM STUNNED.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "BEFORE THEFIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED."
HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN THATTHE UNITED STATES WOULD FIND
ITSELF IN ARMED CONFLICT?
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, IT WAS NOT HARD, SINCE
WE HAVE BEEN AT IT FOR QUITE ABIT.
>> Jon: YES, SIR.>> AND I THINK THAT IN THE LAST
25 YEARS EVER SINCE THE ENDOF THE COLD WAR, WE'VE NEVER
FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS WORLD ISALL ABOUT AND WHAT OUR
PLACE AND ROLE IS IN IT, AS ISAY IN THE BOOK.
AND WE KEEP STUMBLING THROUGHAND STUMBLING INTO
MANY OF THESEARMED CONFLICTS AND ACTUALLY
MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE. ITHINK THAT WHAT WE'VE
INHERITED TODAY ISLARGELY BECAUSE WE INTERVENED IN
PLACES WITHOUT A STRATEGY AND ACLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE
NEEDED TO DO IF WE NEEDED TO DOANYTHING.
>> Jon: SO IN SOME RESPECTS,BY DESTABILIZING THE MIDDLE
EAST THROUGH OUR INTERVENTIONS,WE HAVE DESTABILIZED IT?
>> YES.(LAUGHTER)
MASTERFULLY.
I THINK WHEN WE WENT INTO IRAQ,IT WAS AN UNNECESSARY WAR.
WRONG WAR, WRONG PLACE. WRONGTIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I THINK OUR BUSINESS WAS WITH
AL QAEDA IN AFGHANISTAN.
WE GOT DISTRACTED, LET AL QAEDAESCAPE.
WE TRIED TO RENT AN ARMY INAFGHANISTAN, NORTHERN ALLIANCE,
WHICH WAS TERRIBLE.
WE'RE TRYING THE SAME THING NOWWITH A RENTED ARMY WITH KURDS
AND IRAQIS AND OTHERS...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I DON'T THINK THAT'SGOING TO DO WELL EITHER.
>> Jon: AND IN SYRIA, ASWELL THEY'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE
TO TRAIN THE REBEL GROUPSTHAT ARE MORE
MODERATE IN SYRIA BECAUSETHEY WILL BE, I GUESS,
OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO TAKEOUT I.S.I.S.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TOWORK.
I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'TKNOW WHO THEY ARE.
WE'RE GOING TO SEND WEAPONS IN,NOT SURE WHO IS GOING TO GET
THEM.
WE HAVEN'T VETTED THEM.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THEMTHROUGH.
THEY HAVE ANOTHER WAR ON THEIRHANDS FIGHTING ASSAD'S FORCES.
WE'RE BETTING THAT THEYWILL TAKE OUT I.S.I.S. OR TRY OR
HELP TAKE IT OUT. I DON'T THINKTHEY WILL BE CAPABLE,
MAYBE NOT EVEN WILLING IN MANYCIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Jon: WHAT IF WE TURNEDAROUND AND SHUT OUR EYES?
(CHUCKLE)>> YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT THIS GROUPCOMMITTED GENOCIDE.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THIS GROUP HAS BEHEADED,CRUCIFIED.
THIS GROUP HAS TAKEN 13,14-YEAR OLD GIRLS,
AND GAVE THEM TO THEIR FIGHTERS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I THINK THERE'S A MORALRESPONSIBILITY HERE.
I MEAN, I COULD TELL YOU...
>> Jon: BUT ASSAD HASDONE, YOU KNOW ASSAD HAS
BOMBED INDISCRIMINATELY HIS OWNPEOPLE.
>> YES.>> Jon: YOU KNOW, AT WHAT POINT
DO WE DECIDE WHAT IS THE MORALIMPERATIVE?
BECAUSE THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOTOF PLACES IN THIS WORLD WHERE
ATROCITIES ARECOMMITTED EVERY DAY.
>> YES, AND WE CAN'T BE THEWORLD'S POLICEMAN, THAT'S
USUALLY THE FOLLOWON. BUT IN PLACES WHERE IT'S SO
EGREGIOUS, WHERE IT IS SOTERRIBLE, SO BAD,
WHEN YOU SEE LIKE THE YAZIDISAND THE CHALDEANS AND OTHERS
AND THE INTENT IS TO WIPETHEM OUT.
>> Jon: YES.>> EVERY LAST MAN, WOMAN,
AND CHILD, ANDWHEN YOU SEE THE HORRIFIC THINGS
THEY PUT ON VIDEO, I KNOW THEREARE OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD
WHERE THINGS LIKE THIS GO ON,BUT I THINK WE HAVE AN
OBLIGATION, A MORAL OBLIGATIONAS THE GREATEST POWER ON EARTH
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. IMEAN, AS A MILITARY PERSON.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S TOUGHFOR ME TO STAND BY AND SEE THAT.
>> Jon: IS OUR MORALOBLIGATION STRONGER BECAUSE OF
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER BECAUSE,IN MANY WAYS, WE CREATED THIS
NIGHTMARE?
OR CREATED SOME OF THECONDITIONS THAT ALLOWED THIS
NIGHTMARE TO FLOURISH?
IS THAT WHY THE MORAL IMPERATIVEIS STRONGER HERE THAN IT MIGHT
BE IN ANOTHER AREA?
>> I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY THAT.
THERE'S A SENSE OF GUILT ANDRESPONSIBILITY, BUT I THINK
THERE'S A SENSE OF GUILT THAT WELET THE HOLOCAUST GO ON, OR
RWANDA AND BARUNDI GO ON WITHOUTDOING NOTHING, AND EVEN
CAMBODIA WITH THE KHMER ROUGE,SO THAT GUILT WORKS BOTH WAYS.
WHERE WE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TOIT, THERE ARE TIMES IN OUR
HISTORY WHERE WE LOOKED THEOTHER WAY WHERE I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD HAVE BEENRIGHT FOR AMERICA TO DO.
>> Jon: RIGHT, IN THISSITUATION. SO, ALL RIGHT, SO
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO. WE'LL COMEBACK. AND WE'LL TALK THEN ABOUT
WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO NOT LOOKTHE OTHER WAY AND HOW NOT TO
REPEAT THE MISTAKES THATWE'VE MADE IN THESE DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS, AND YOU RAN THEMBACK FROM THE HOLOCAUST TO
SAIGON TO UP TO PRESENT DAY ANDHOW WE TRY NOT TO REPEAT THAT.
MORE WITH GENERAL TONY ZINNIRIGHT AFTER THIS.
