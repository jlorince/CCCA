ONE OF YOU DOES HAVE A VAGINAL WE CAN TRANS, DON'T YOU?
(LAUGHTER) NOW THIS IS VERY CRAFTY CASE FOR GAY MARRIAGE PROPONENTS TO BRING TO THE SUPREME COURT.
AS THE CASE SETS IT IS A BIT OF A TRAP FOR CONSERVATIVES.
>> THE DOMO CASE CONSIDERS WHETHER SOMEONE LIVED WITH A DOMESTIC PARTY FOR 35 YEARS
SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ESTATE TAXES WHEREAS HAD THEY BEEN PARRIED AS HUSBAND AND WIFE
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY ESTATE TAXES.
>> Jon: THERE'S THE QUESTION, CONSERVATIVES, YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE ESTATE TAX FOR
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE BUT ONLY IF YOU LET THEM GET GAY MARRIED.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S A VERITABLE REAGAN'S CHOICE.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
(APPLAUSE) GAY MARRIAGE OR DOUBLE TAXATION.
GAY MARRIAGE OR DOUBLE TAXATION.
OBVIOUSLY THE POSITIONS ON THIS ISSUE HAVE BEEN WELL STAKED OUT.
PROPONENTS OF GAY PAERJ SAY THEIR UNIONS ARE DESERVING OF THE SAME DIGNITY, RESPECT
AND RIGHTS AS THOSE OF STRAIGHT COUPLES AND ARE ASKING FOR NOTHING MORE THAN EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW.
TO WHICH THEIR OPPONENTS SMARTLY ARGUE --
>> I'VE BEEN WAITING TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION.
>> GO ON.
>> IF THE SPACE DON'T LOVE, CAN THREE PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER.
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THREE PEOPLE TO GENUINE LOVELY OPEN AND WANT TO SHARE THEIR LIVES TOGETHER.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, OH--  (LAUGHTER) OH MY GOD!
NO!
NO WAY!
NO WAY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IS LINDSAY GRAHAM ABOUT TO PROPOSE TO McCAIN AND LIEBERMAN?
(LAUGHTER) IMAGINE LIEBERMAN'S RESPONSE.
>> I'M THE HAPPIEST MAN.
I'M IN A THREEWAY TIE FOR BRIDE.
(LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, LINDSAY GRAHAM IS PAGE THE AGE-OLD SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT.
>> I MEAN IF GAY PEOPLE CAN GET MARRIED WHY CAN'T THREE PEOPLE GET MARRIED OR TEN
PEOPLE, OR ANYBODY TO ANYTHING.
AGAIN, PLACING GAYNESS INTO THE CATEGORY OF WHIMSICAL DESIRE FOR SOMETHING UNCONVENTIONAL AS OPPOSED TO
A STATE OF BEING WHO YOU ARE.
GOING UP AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT, THESE GUYS ARE GOING BUY SOME [BLEEP] SLIPPERY
SLOPE ARGUMENT.
>> JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS LEGAL WRITING.
>> A STUDENT ON MONDAY ASKED WHY SCALIA IN PAST WRITINGS HAS COMPARED SODOMY LAWS TO
LAWS ON BEASTIALITY AND MURDER.
>> Jon: SCALIA!
GOOD OLD SLIPPERY SODOMY SLOPE SCALIA.
RUFF LAUGH AKA ANTONIN, AKA LIPS MANLIS FROM THE DICK TRACY MOVIE.
TOTALLY A PAIRING, YOU SEE ON ONE OF THOSE WEB SITES WHERE THE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE
OTHER PEOPLE.
AND THEN YOU CLICK ON IT.
(LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, ANOTHER STANDARD BULL [BLEEP] SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT.
DON'T WORRY I'M SURE ANTONIN SCALIA HAS A MUCH MORE-- OF EXPLAINING IT.
>> IT IS A FORM OF ARGUMENT WHICH IS CALLED A REDUCTION TO THE ABSURD.
>> IF WE CAN TO THE HAVE MORAL FEELINGS AGAINST OR OBJECTIONS TO HOMOSEXUALITY,
CAN WE HAVE IT AGAINST ANYTHING?
>> I'M SURPRISED YOU WEREN'T PERSUADED.
>> Jon: YEAH.
I AM SURPRISED YOU AREN'T PERSUADED, GAY STUDENT WHO ASKED WHY I CATE IS HIS LOVE
LIFE WITH MURDER.
NO WONDER SCALIA NEVER LETS HIMSELF BE RECORDED.
NOW THE COURT WON'T HEAR ARGUMENTS ON THE MATTER UNTIL THE SPRING.
AND PROBABLY WON'T DECIDE UNTIL NEXT SUMMER.
YOU GUYS BETTER HURRY IT UP.
BECAUSE I HEAR NEW YORK IS THINKING OFLYIZING THIS ♪ I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU--  ♪ ♪
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF WE AS A CULTURE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO PRIESTS SINGING--  (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS TO STOP THEM FROM MURDER?
(LAUGHTER)
