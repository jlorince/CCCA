[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]BOOM!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THE CITY SO NICE THEY NAMED IT
TWICE LIKE SIRHAN SIRHAN.
BAD EXAMPLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]AS YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST DOZEN
YEARS WE HERE IN NEW YORK HAVEBEEN UNDER THE
CONTROL OF A SODA HATINGLEPRECHAUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHO AS YOU KNOW --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]-- PURCHASED THE CITY WITH HIS
POT OF GOLD.
[LAUGHTER]BUT TOMORROW NEW YORKERS WILL GO
TO THE POLLS TO DECIDE WHO WILLFILL HIS SHOES, HIS TINY, TINY
SHOES.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PICTURE OFTHOSE SHOES.
HEY!
HEY, YOU -- STUART LITTLE.
GET OUT OF THOSE.
THOSE ARE THE MAYOR'S SHOES.
GET OUT OF THERE.
PS, THE MAYOR AND I ARE THEEXACT SAME SIZE.
RIGHT NOW THE MAYOR'S RACE ISBETWEEN DEMOCRAT BILL DE BLASIO
AND REPUBLICAN JOE LHOTA.BLASIOALTHOUGH CALLING IT A RACE MAY
BEA WEE BIT OF AN OVERSTATEMENT.
>> DE BLASIO HAS A 45% LEAD INTHE RACE TO BE THE BIG APPLE'S
NEXT MAYOR.
>> Jon: 45% -- THAT'S THE SAMEAMOUNT THAT HOT DOG IS BEATING
RAT ON A STICK AS NEW YORK'SNGFAVORITE STREET FOOD.
JOE LHOTA MAY COME IN THIRD TODRUNK ANTISEMITIC TIMES SQUARE
ELMO. BUT TO HEAR JOE LHOTA TELLIT HIS SECOND PLACE STATUS IS
AN ASSET.
>> HE SAID HE IS THE UNDERDOGBUT ADDED NEW YORKERS LOVE AN
UNDERDOG.
>> Jon: IF YOU WERE TEN POINTSDOWN YOU WOULD BE AN UNDERDOG.
AT 50 POINTS YOU ARE A SAD DOG.
YOU ARE LIKE THE KIND OF DOGTHAT SARAH McLACHLAN SINGS
SONGS OVER THE TOP OF.
â™ª THROUGH THE ARMS OF AN ANGEL [LAUGHTER]
WOW.
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A MAYOR INTORONTO GOING I'M SMOKING WAY
TOO MUCH CRACK.
[LAUGHTER]I ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR JOE LHOTA.
HIS OPPONENT HAS A TON OFCHARISMA RIGHT DOWN TO HIS
FAMILY WITHTHEIR OWN SIGNATURE DANCE MOVES.
CHECK THAT OUT.
HOW DO YOU FIGHT THAT?
>> HE TALKS A GOOD GAME BUT BOYHE CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE FIRST
INNING BECAUSE ONCE YOU ASK ADETAILED QUESTION IT'S BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH BLAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THAT'S YOUR BEST SHOT
WHEN YOU ASK HIM A QUESTION HEANSWERS IT WITH WORDS.
YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THATESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN NEW JERSEYGOVERNOR JON CORZINE (bleep)
