>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"!
I'M JON STEWART!
MY GUEST TONIGHT ONE ANGELINAJOLIE, DIRECTOR OF THE NEW FILM,
IT'S GREAT "UNBROKEN".
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO APOLOGIZEFOR YESTERDAY.
I BEGAN THE SHOW SOMEWHATOVERWROUGHT BECAUSE NO ONE
INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF ERICGARNER WAS NEVER INDICTED.
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSEI WAS WRONG.
>> THE PERSON WHO DID THEVIDEOGRAPHY OF THIS.
>> YES.>> THAT PERSON
WAS INDICTED BY A GRAND JURY INSTATEN ISLAND OVER GUN CHARGES.
>> Jon: GET IT? SOMEONE WASINDICTED. THEY GOT
THE SHOOTER... OF THE VIDEO...
LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU KIDSOUT THERE.
PHOTOGRAPHING CRIME DOES NOTPAY.
BUT WHAT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTANDABOUT THIS IS THAT FOR MONTHS
WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTHABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH
DARREN WILSON AND MICHAEL BROWNIN FERGUSON, MISSOURI.
DID BROWN HAVE HIS HANDS UP?
DID HE NOT HAVE HIS HANDS UP?
WAS WILSON AFRAID FOR HIS LIFEWHEN HE KILLED BROWN?
REASONABLE PEOPLE --AS WELL AS PLENTY OF (BLEEP)
ONES -- COULD --OKAY, THEIR PICTURES DIDN'T COME
UP.
(LAUGHTER)-- COULD REACH DIFFERENT
CONCLUSIONS.
BUT IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NOAMBIGUITY.
EVEN WITH CLARITY THOUGH, PEOPLECONTINUE TO BLAME
THIS DEATH ON ANYTHING BUT THEINJUSTICES OF A FLAWED SYSTEM.
>> WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'TUNDERSTAND IS THAT MAN WAS
A BIG MAN.
>> HE'S A HUGE INDIVIDUAL.
>> GARNER OUTWEIGHED THE OFFICERBY PROBABLY 150 POUNDS.
>> Jon: HE IS GIGANTOR! HE IS AFLOAT IN A PARADE.
THEY HAD TO BRING HIMDOWN!
HE WAS THE ABOMINABLE BRO MAN!
OK YEAH, HE OUTWEIGHED "ONE" COPBY 150 POUNDS.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FIVE COPS?OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST HOW MUCH
RACIAL PROGRESS AMERICA HASMADE?
YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE BLACKPEOPLE WERE ONLY THREE-FIFTHS OF
A WHITE PERSON.
NOW, THEY'RE LIKE SIX!
UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER REASONHIS SIZE WAS RELEVANT?
>> IF HE HAD NOT HAD ASTHMA ANDA HEART CONDITION AND WAS SO
OBESE, HE ALMOST DEFINITELYWOULD NOT HAVE DIED FROM THIS.
THE POLICE HAD NO REASON TO KNOWTHAT HE WAS IN SERIOUS
CONDITION.
>> Jon: PLEASE...
ASTHMA, HEART DISEASE, OBESITY,YEAH, THOSE ARE SERIOUS
CONDITIONS BUT, COME ON!
COME ON, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'SREPORT SAYS THAT GARNER DIED
FROM "COMPRESSION OF THE NECK"AND "COMPRESSION OF THE CHEST."
THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE DEATH BYCHOKING THAN DEATH BY CHOCOLATE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.THE NYPD PATROL GUIDE DEFINES A
A CHOKEHOLD AS ANY PRESSURE TOTHE THROAT OR WINDPIPE
WHICH MAY PREVENT BREATHING ORINTAKE OF AIR. WELL,
LISTEN TO ONE EXPERT EXPLAIN WHYTHIS CASE ISN'T THAT.
>> I WOULDN'T USE THE TERMCHOKEHOLD AS A MARTIAL ARTITS
STUDENT, I WOULDN'TUSE THAT TERM.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: GO ON, SENSEI.
>> IF YOU GO FOR THE TRACHEOR WHAT'S CALLED AN AIR CHOKE OR
THE WINDPIPE, YOU CAN LITERALLYKILL SOMEBODY.
THAT'S ILLEGAL BY EVERY POLICEDEPARTMENT STANDARD.
SO THE DEFINITIONS, IT MAY SOUNDTECHNICAL, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T
IN THIS CASE, IS IT?
>> Jon: NO, IT IS, MR. MIYAGI,RESPECTFULLY.
THAT'S WHAT LITERALLY HAPPENED!
FACTS ON, FACTS OFF.
ALRIGHT, SO WE'VE ESTABLISHEDBUT INCREDIBLY FRAGILE, OUT OF
SHAPE MONSTER WEAKLING. AGAIN,THEY WOULD JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
AGAINST ALL AVAILABLECRIMINOLOGY STATISTICS THAT
EVERYONE IS EQUAL UNDER THE LAW.
>> PEOPLE SAY VERY CASUALLY THATTHIS WAS DONE OUT OF RACIAL
MOTIVES OR OUT OF VIOLATIONS OFCIVIL RIGHTS.
>> THERE'S NOT A HINT THERE THATANYONE USED ANY RACIAL EPITHET.
>> Jon: SO, THE COPS HAVE TO USETHE N-WORD FOR IT TO BE RACISM?
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THE PHRASE APICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND
EPITHETS? I DON'TKNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT
THIS COP IS RACISTBUT IT SEEMS THE ESCALATION OF
THESE INCIDENTS MAYBE A BY-PRODUCT OF A SYSTEM
THAT'S APPLIED UNEQUALLY ANDWITH PREJUDICE.
BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT THAT, WHATIS IT?
>> IN THIS CASE, THE POLICEOFFICER WAS DEALING WITH A
CRIMINAL WHO WAS RESISTINGARREST.
MAYBE IF MR. BROWN HADN'TCOMMITTED HIS CRIMES AND THIS
GENTLEMAN HADN'T RESISTEDARREST, THEY WOULDN'T BE
DEAD TODAY.
>> Jon: YEAH, OR IF THEYDIDN'T CHOKE HIM.
I MEAN, NOT EVERYONE WHORESISTS ARREST -- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK I CAN DO THIS.
THIS YOUR HONOR, MAY I APPROACH?
NOT THAT WE WERE HAVING A TRIAL,OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S WHAT THE GRAND JURY WASGOING TO TRY TO GET TO BE DONE.
BUT IF IT PLEASES THE COURT, IWOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THAT
RESISTING ARREST DOESN'T ALWAYSLEAD TO THIS SORT OF THING.
HERE'S EVIDENCE, EXHIBIT A.
>> COME ON.>> GET OFF THE BEACH NOW.
>> GET THE (BLEEP) OFF MY ARMBEFORE -- GET THE (BLEEP) OFF.
GET OFF!
>> FOR BEING A NUISANCE.REALLY? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A CHARGE FOR THAT.
>> I'M A (BLEEP) GOOD PERSON!
>> WATCH YOUR HEAD, WATCH YOURHEAD.
>> Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME SHEWAS LESS OF A MENACE TO SOCIETY
AT THAT TIME?
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE'SSTRAIGHTENED HER LIFE OUT AND
HAS SHOWN US THAT SHE IS,AND I'M QUOTING HERE, A
(BLEEP) GOOD PERSON, BUT -- COMEON, PEOPLE, WON'T ANYONE ADMIT
THIS IS SYMPTOMATIC OF A LARGERISSUE?
>> JOINING ME NOW IS KENTUCKYSENATOR RAND PAUL.
>> I THINK THERE'S SOMETHINGBIGGER THAN JUST THE INDIVIDUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Jon: THANK YOU!
RAND PAUL!
YOU KNOW, HERE IS A REPUBLICANWHO HAS BEEN MAKING AN EFFORT TO
REACH OUT TO THEBLACK COMMUNITY.
HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT VOTINGRIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE.
SO THIS IS,THIS IS A START.
GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT.
WHAT IS THE LARGER ISSUE HERE?
>> SOME POLITICIAN PUT A TAX OF$5.85 ON A PACK OF CIGARETTES,
SO THEY'VE DRIVEN CIGARETTESUNDERGROUND BY MAKING THEM SO
EXPENSIVE.
BUT THEN SOME POLITICIAN ALSOHAD TO DIRECT THE POLICE TO SAY,
HEY, WE WANT YOU ARRESTINGPEOPLE FOR SELLING A LOOSE
CIGARETTE.
>> Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP) AREYOU TALKING ABOUT?
WELL, I GUESS NOW WE KNOW WHATIT TAKES FOR A SENATOR FROM
KENTUCKY TO ADMIT CIGARETTES CANKILL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!
I APPRECIATE THE PURITY OF YOURANTI-TAX DOGMA, BUT THE
CIGARETTE TAX IS TRULY THE LEASTSALIENT ASPECT OF THIS CASE!
IT'S LIKE SAYING, YOU KNOW THEPROBLEM WITH THE HINDENBURG,
GOVERNMENT PARKING REGULATIONS.
THAT'S IT!
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT BIG BROTHEROVER YOUR SHOULDER GOING,
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO DOCK!
(LAUGHTER)HONESTLY, ERIC GARNER COULD HAVE
BEEN OUT THERE WITH MIXTAPES OR A A SQUEEGEE OR A
SNOWCONE AND THE SAME KIND OF(BLEEP) COULD HAVE HAPPENED.
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TENDAYS, A GRAND JURY, WHICH AT
LEAST IN FEDERAL CASES HAS A 99%INDICTMENT RATE,
FAILED TO INDICT AN OFFICER WHOCAUSED THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED
CITIZEN. THEY DIDN'T INDICT HIMFOR ANYTHING.
NOT MURDER, NOT MANSLAUGHTER,NOT EVEN RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT
WHICH IS LIKE ONE DEGREEABOVE A PARTY FOUL.
AND FOR SOME REASON TO QUESTIONA SYSTEM PRODUCING THAT RESULT
IS SOMEHOW OFFENSIVE.
>> THIS PROCESS HAS TAKEN PLACE.
IT'S OUR CONSTITUTION.
IT'S THE LAWS WE LIVE BY.
GET OVER IT.
>> THEY ARE TEARING DOWN RESPECTFOR A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
THAT GOES BACK TO ENGLAND IN THE11th CENTURY.
>> Jon: SO DOES WITCH BURNINGAND (BLEEP) WHERE WE DRINK.
BUT WE'VE CONTINUED TO IMPROVEUPON THOSE PROCESSES!
YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT IUNDERSTAND, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM HAS TWO SEPARATE BUTEQUALLY IMPORTANT PARTS -- THE
POLICE WHO INVESTIGATE CRIMESAND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO
PROSECUTE!
(LAUGHTER)OKAY.
I GOT THAT FROM TV.
GRAND JURIES ALMOST ALWAYS DOWHAT THE PROSECUTOR WANTS.
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHENIT COMES TO THE POLICE IF
PROSECUTORS REALLY DON'T WANT TOINDICT THEM BECAUSE THEY WORK
WITH THEM AND THEY NEED THEM ANDTHEY'RE ON THE SAME SHOW WITH
THEM, THEY'RE COLLEAGUES, ANDTHAT MAKES FOR A VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION.
HEY, BEFORE I TRY AND SEND YOUTO PRISON, THERE'S SOMETHING I
GOTTA ASK YOU -- THIS YEAR, AREYOU MY SECRET SANTA?
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
