INDIANS LOOKING FOR IN-DEPTHREPORTING NEED TO ONLY TURN TO
ONE OF THEIR 93,000 REGISTEREDNEWSPAPERS. THAT'S RIGHT,
INDIA'S PRINT MEDIA FOUND ASURPRISING NEW WAY TO REMAIN
PROFITABLE.
>> ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVEENCOUNTERED RECENTLY IS THE PAID

THEY LABEL THEM AT THE TOP, THISIS AN ADVERTISEMENT.

MAKE IT SEEM LIKE I AM?
>> I CAN DO THAT.
>> JUST LIKE, I'M DOING THE BESTTO COVER IT.
HOW ABOUT A POLL THAT SAYS I'MGOING TO BEST COVERAGE.

MYSELF AND THE NEXT MORNING ITWAS PRINTED IN A
NATIONAL NEWSPAPERTHAT HERALDS ITSELF
