[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> OH, WELCOME BACK.
I WANT THE TALK ABOUT SOMETHINGNEAR TO MY HEART, GERMANS.
EASY PEOPLE TO LOVE, THE HUMOR,THE LANGUAGE, THEIR WHIMSICAL
DEDICATION TO RUTHLESSEFFICIENCY.
BUT RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWOCOUNTRIES HAVE COOLED.
JASON JONES HAS MORE.
>> EVER SINCE PUTIN ANNEXEDCRIMEA, THE U.S. HAS BEEN URGING
ALLIES IN THE E.U. TO GETTOUGHER WITH RUSSIA, BUT SOME OF
OUR SUPPOSED FRIENDS LIKEGERMANY HAVE BEEN REACTING A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN WE'D LIKE, SOI MET WITH ACTING GERMAN
AMBASSADOR PHILIP ACKERMAN TOSEE JUST WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE'SMORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BETWEEN
GERMANY AND RUSSIA THAN BETWEENTHE AMERICANS AND RUSSIA.
AND IF YOU SEE THE POLES, THENYOU'LL SEE THAT THE GERMAN
PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE ASORT OF A MORE APOLOGETIC
VIEW OF WHAT PUTIN DID.
>> WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARECLOSER TO THEM THAN YOU ARE TO
US?
>> NO.
OH, OH, OH. I WOULD HAVE TO...
>> THAT'S THE EXACT EMPHATICRESPONSE I WAS LOOKING FOR.
>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVEAN OLD RELATION WITH RUSSIA.
WHICH JUST CAN'T, YOU CAN'TTHROW IT AWAY.
>> REMEMBER, THOUGH, WE WERE THEONES WHO SAID,
"ICH BIN EIN BERLINER.">> YEAH.
>> OK. THE OTHER GUYS, THEY,WELL...

UNITED STATES. THE TRUSTIN AMERICA AMONGST THE
GERMAN PUBLIC DROPPED. IF WEWORK CLOSELY TOGETHER, IF

TAPPING HER PHONE.
>> GERMAN LEADER SAID TRUST INTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS
BEEN SHATTERED AND WILL NEED TOBE REBUILT.
>> BUT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVEANYTHING TO HIDE, THEN WHY
SHOULD THEY CARE ABOUTUS SPYING ON THEM.
DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD EVER BEA REASON ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY
FOR US NOT TO TRUST YOU?
>> GENERALLY SPEAKING, I WOULDSAY THAT GERMANY AND AMERICA
HAVE BEEN SO CLOSE ALLIES THATIT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO...
>> YOU CAN'T THINK OF MAYBEONE...

THE FRIENDSHIP STARTS IN 1945,YOU KNOW, WHEN THE U.S. WERE
THE ONES WHO REALLY GAVE USA SECOND CHANCE.
>> YOU MEAN THIRD.
>> AND WE ARE IMMENSELY GRATEFULFOR THAT, AND...
>> OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DIDSEE, WHAT DID YOU WANT US TO NOT
SEE?
>> I AM NOT AN INTELLIGENCE GUY.
>> DID YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE,THOUGH?
>> NO. YOU SAID "NOT SEE." NAZI.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW,THEY WERE ACTUALLY RIGHT,
FRIENDS SHOULDNEVER SPY ON EACH OTHER.
>> GERMAN PRESS REPORTS SUGGESTTHE COUNTRY'S INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY SPIED ONTURKEY FOR YEARS.
>> MOTHER [BLEEPED] WERE DOINGTHE EXACT SAME THING YOU WERE,
WHICH MEANS WE'RE MEANT FOR ONEANOTHER.
IT WAS TIME TO FULLY HEAL THISDIVIDE IN A WAY ALL AMERICANS
AND GERMANS WOULD APPRECIATE.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GETTINGSOMEWHERE.
>> YEAH, I HAVE THIS STRONGFEELING TOO, ACTUALLY.
>> YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU DON'TWANT THE LOSE OUT ON ALL WE
HAVE TO OFFER, RIGHT? IMEAN, THE GERMANS,
