>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'RE BACK! BOOM! TONIGHT'SGUEST, OLD FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO.HE'S GOT HIS BOOK OUT,
"SUICIDE PACT."
WHICH IS, IT'S REALLY FUNNIERTHAN IT SOUNDS.
BUT FIRST, WHILE WE WERE ALLHOME LAST WEEK, RIDDING THE
NATION OF ITS TURKEYSCOURGE--
(LAUGHTER) THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID.
THE GRAND JURY VERDICT INMISSOURI WAS DECIDING THAT
FERGUSON POLICE OFFICER NOWFORMER FERGUSON POLICE
OFFICER DARREN WILSON DIDNOTHING INDICTABLE WHEN HE
SHOT UNARMED BUT LARGEMICHAEL BROWN.
THE ANGRY REACTION TO THISDECISION WAS SWIFT AND
SUSTAINED.
THE PROTESTS BREAKING OUTTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
BUT IF THOSE WHO TOOK THESTREETS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE
SPEAKING OUT AGAINSTSYSTEMIC INJUSTICE,
THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MOREWRONG.
>> THIS IS NOT A CIVILRIGHTS ISSUE.
>> IT'S NOT A BLACK WHITESITUATION.
>> IT'S A THUG-POLICEOFFICER SITUATION.
>> PEOPLE FORGET, HE HADCOMMITTED A ROBBERY.
>> MICHAEL BROWN WAS THE BADGUY IN THIS CASE.
AND PLEASE, AMERICA, LET'SNOT TURN THIS KID INTO SOME
KIND OF CIVIL RIGHTS MARTYRBECAUSE THAT HE IS NOT.
>> FERGUSON, MISSOURI IS NOTSELMA, ALABAMA.
>> Jon: RIGHT!
(LAUGHTER)ALMOST BY DEFINITION.
(LAUGHTER)FERGUSON, MISSOURI, IS NOT
SELMA, ALABAMA.
OF COURSE, IF FOX HAD BEENAROUND FOR SELMA, ALABAMA,
THE HEADLINE WOULD PROBABLYHAVE BEEN, RELAX, SELMA
ISN'T SLAVERY.  SO THIS ISN'T ACIVIL RIGHTS THING.
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW.
THE PROTESTS I SAW SEEMEDPRETTY CIVIL RIGHTS-Y.
FROM THOSE IN LOS ANGELES TOTHE NFL, TO THE STREETS
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK.
>> [BLEEP] THE ANGER. [BLEEP]THE LEVEL OF [BLEEP] [BLEEP]
VOICES [BLEEP] HAS ONLYGOTTEN LOUDER.
AND THEY'VE PICKED PEOPLE UPALONG THE WAY.
>> [BLEEP] CNN [BLEEP] CNN!
AS YOU CAN HEAR [BLEEP] THESEPEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PROTEST.
>> [BLEEP] CNN!
>> I FEEL YOU.
(LAUGHTER)BUT I GET WHAT YOU ARE
SAYING THERE.
THIS IS AN ISOLATEDINCIDENT.
LIKE THE POLICE SHOOTING OFTAMIR RICE IN CLEVELAND OR
DANTE PARKER IN SANBERNARDINO COUNTY OR KENDREC
McDADE IN PASADENA OR ARMANDBENNETT IN NEW ORLEANS OR
JOHN CRAWFORD -- WHAT TIME DOES
COLBERT START? WHAT TIME DOESHIS SHOW START?
IT'S IN LIKE A HALF HOUR, RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, WE'LLJUST-- WE'LL MOVE ON.
THE POINT IS-- THESESHOOTINGS ARE CLEARLY NOT A
MANIFESTATION OF SYSTEMICINEQUALITY AND MISTRUST
BETWEEN THE AFRICAN-AMERICANCOMMUNITY AND THE SOMEHOW
ALWAYS JUSTIFIED POLICEAMERICAN COMMUNITY.
BUT THESE ARE MERELY ANUNENDING BIZARRELY SIMILAR
SERIES OF ISOLATEDINCIDENTS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT IF THERE IS NOTHING TO
JUSTIFY THE ANGER ANDPROTESTS IN THESE
COMMUNITIES, WHY WOULD SOMANY INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE
COUNTRY SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS,HARD-EARNED PRE-CHRISTMAS
SALE STAMPEDING TIMEPROTESTING A NONEXISTENT
PROBLEM.
>> YOU LOOK AT FERGUSON,THEY HAD A COMMUNITY THAT
REALLY WORKED, OR IT SEEMEDTO HAVE WORKED.
AND NOW ALL THIS HATREDIS COMING OUT.
YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHERPEOPLE INCITING AND TRYING
TO GET THEIR OWN TWO CENTSIN AND THEY'RE TRYING TO INCITE
PROBLEMS.>> SURE.
>> PITTING WHITES AGAINSTBLACKS.
>> I THINK THE RACIALARSONISTS IN THIS COUNTRY
HAVE WORKED THESE PEOPLE UPSO MUCH WITH PROPAGANDA,
THAT FACTS DON'T MATTER.
>> OH, THAT'S WHY.
THEY TAKE TO THE STREETS.
THEY WERE INCITED BY RACIALARSONISTS.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DREAM.
THAT ONE DAY WE CAN EVOLVEAS A PEOPLE TO A TIME WHEN
ARSONISTS NO LONGER SEE RACE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT SEE REALLY ONLY THE
BEAUTIFUL CONSUMING FIRETHEY ARE CRIMINALLY COMPELLED
TO LIGHT. WHEN AN ARSONIST
CAN SAY THE ONLY COLOR I SEEIS ORANGE.
BUT I GET IT, THEY'REOBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T BE A
PROBLEM IF A RACIAL ARSONIST-- IF A RACIAL
ARSONIST HADN'T-- IF ARACIAL ARSONIST HADN'T LIT
THE FIRE UNDER FERGUSON WITHHIS TELLING OF WHAT HAPPENED
MATCH.
AND BY THE WAY, RACIALARSONISTS WERE NOT THE ONLY
INCITERS.
>> THESE RACIALRACKETEERS.
>> RACE HUSTLERS
>> RACE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRYLEADERS.
>> YOUR RACE GRIFTERS, YOURRACE COUNTERFEITERS, YOUR
RACE LITTERERS, YOUR RACEFINANCIAL ADVISORS, YOUR
RACE, YOUR RACE SOMMELIERS.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH A NICEWHITE?
BUT-- (APPLAUSE)
BUT THE POINT IS, THESEPROTESTS MAY LOOK LIKE A
SPONTANEOUS GROUNDSWELL OFFRUSTRATION, GRIEF AND ANGER
AMONGST THE COMMUNITY THATFEELS DISENFRANCHISED.
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUSTTHE PRESCRIBED BIDDING OF
AMERICA'S RACE GRIEVANCEPUPPETEERS.
AND WHO MIGHT THEY BE,YOU ASK?
PROFESSOR?
THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
>> THE PRESIDENT AND ERICHOLDER AND AL SHARPTON, I
THINK THEY'VE BEEN TERRIBLYIRRESPONSIBLE.
>> FERGUSON BURNS BECAUSE OFIN PART A MIND-SET WAS
CREATED BY AL SHARPTON, BYERIC HOLDER AND THE
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: BE HONEST MY FRIEND,ARE THOSE THE THREE PEOPLE
RESPONSIBLE OR DID YOU JUSTNAME THE ONLY THREE BLACK
GUYS YOU COULD THINK OF?
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
WHAT? WHICH ONE? FERGUSON BURNS,MY FRIEND, IN PART BECAUSE OF
JAY-Z THE GUY WHO PLAYS URKELAND LET'S SAY HANK AARON.
I DON'T KNOW.
NOW HERE'S WHERE IT GETSINTERESTING.
WHAT IS THE MIND-SET THATHAS BEEN INSTILLED, THAT
CREATES THE CONDITIONS FORTHIS UPSET WITHIN THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY?
>> THE HEAD OF THIS NETWORKROGER AILES HAS BRILLIANTLY
SAID THAT IF YOU SEEYOURSELF AS A VICTIM, THEN
YOU WILL BECOME A VICTIM,BUT IF YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A
WINNER, THEN YOU WILLEVENTUALLY WIN.
>> KEEP A DREAM JOURNAL,FOLKS.
(LAUGHTER)A VICTIM MENTALITY IS
WHAT IS CAUSING THIS.
A VICTIM MENTALITY.
A GENTLEMAN ON FOX.
A GENTLEMAN ON FOX NEWS SAIDTHAT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
CONVINCED BY A NETWORK OFSHREWD PROPAGANDISTS THAT
THEY ARE SOMEHOW VICTIMS.
AND THAT IS WRONG TO AGITATEA POPULATION, TO SCARE THEM,
UTILIZING ALL THE TOOLS OFMODERN COMMUNICATIONS,
GRAPHICS, MUSIC, ET CETERA.
TO STOKE THESE PEOPLE INTO ARESENTFUL FRENZY.
FOX NEWS FEELS THAT'S JUSTDAMAGING TO THIS GREAT
NATION AND TEARS ATOUR VERY FABRIC.
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE WOULDDO SUCH A THING AT --
JUST ROLL THE [BLEEP] TAPE.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SELLINGCLASS WARFARE.
>> IS THERE A GROWINGANTI-WHITE PEOPLE MOVEMENT
IN AMERICA?
>> THE FEDS AND MANY STATEGOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING HARD
TO TAKE THAT WAY YOUR GUNS.
>> MEANWHILE THEY WILL TAKEYOUR MONEY.
>> THE INVASION OF ILLEGALIMMIGRANTS.
>> WE HAVE TERRORISTSCROSSING THE MEXICAN BORDER.
>> SINGLED OUT FOR ITSCHRISTIAN MESSAGE.
>> WE CAN PICK ON WHITE GUYS, WECAN PICK ON CHRISTIANS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> FOOD STAMP ABUSERS, FEEDINGON TAXPAYERS.
>> THE UNITED STATES OFENTITLEMENT.
>> THEY'RE STEALING OURMONEY AND THE TAXPAYERS
SHOULD RISE UP.
>> WE ARE UNDER A TYRANNYNOW.
>> ALL HAIL KING OBAMA.>> AN IMPERIAL PRESIDENT.
>> AMERICA'S FREEDOM IS SLIPPINGAWAY.
>> AMERICA'S BEST DAYS AREBEHIND HER.
>> AMERICA YOU HAVE ACHOICE TO MAKE.
>> IT IS TIME THAT WE TAKE OURCOUNTRY BACK.
>> YOU NEED TO GET ANGRY.
OUR WORST FEARS MIGHT VERYWELL BE HERE.
>> HOLY [BLEEP].
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSEDTO OVERTHROW THE
GOVERNMENT OR GET ONE OFTHEM PANIC ROOMS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.BUT EITHER WAY, I'M JUST
HAPPY TO NOT BE INCITED.
IT ALMOST MAKES YOU THINKTHAT THE CRIME THAT THEY'RE
REALLY UP SET ABOUT OVERTHERE ISN'T RACE PIMPING OR
RACE ARSON, IT'S RACEPLAGIARISM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
