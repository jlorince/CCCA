[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: HEY EVERYBODY!
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW! MYNAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONETONIGHT. LISTEN UP.
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THISONE.
MY GUEST TONIGHT HADIAL-BAHRA, HE IS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE SYRIANNATIONAL COALITION, AND
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE ON OURSIDE OR HE WOULDN'T BE HERE.
OF COURSE OUR NON WAR IN THE MIDEAST IS ONLY GETTING MORE
COMPLICATED.
THE U.S. AND ITS COALITION HASBEEN BOMBING THE REGION FOR
NEARLY A WEEK, AND, YOU KNOW,WE'RE JUST WONDER TO OURSELVES
HERE, ANYONE ELSE WANT IN ONTHIS? WHO'S GOT NEXT?
YOU KNOW, BEFORE ALL OF THE GOODBUILDINGS ARE GONE.
>> BRITISH PARLIAMENT ISEXPECTED TO VOTE SOON TO JOIN
THE AIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISIS.
PRIME MINISTER CAMERON RECALLEDLAW MAKERS FOR A SPECIAL SESSION
TO DEBATE THIS ISSUE.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: LAW -- LAW MAKERS DEBATE
THE ISSUE?
CAMERON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITHTHAT ANSWERING QUESTIONS [BEEP].
YOU JUST WALK OUT ONTO YOUR LAWNAND YOU SAY WE'RE BOMBING
SOMEWHERE AND GO BACK INSIDE.
BADA BING BADA LITERAL BOOM.
DONE. I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOUDOING?
WHAT IS THERE EVEN TOTALK ABOUT?
>> LOOK AT WHAT THE HOUSE OFCOMMONS HAVE BROUGHT YOU.
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, ANDTHIS GOVERNMENT LIBYA.
NONE ARE SUCCESS STORIES.
ARE WE GOING TO EMBARK ON ACTIONTHAT COULD LAST FOR YEARS?
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: WELL, SURE.
IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT INHISTORICAL CONTEXT.
>> WHY BRITISH MILITARY ACTIONAGAINST ISIL BARBARITY BUT NOT
ASSAD'S BUTCHERY?
>> SUCH ALLITERATIVE CRITICISM.
WELL, ALRIGHT, THAT'S ALLTHE TIME WE HAVE FOR THE --
UNSHAVEN BLOKE IN THE BACK, WHATDO YOU HAVE THERE?
>> THIS WILL NOT BE SOLVED BYBOMBING.
EVERYTHING WILL BE MADEWORSE.
EXTREMISM WILL SPREAD FURTHERAND DEEPER AROUND THE WORLD.
THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE CAN SEE IT,THAT THE FOOLS IN HERE WHO DRAW
BIG SALARIES AND BIG EXPENSESCAN NOT OR WILL NOT SEE IT
LIKE THE HONORABLE LADY WITHOUR ASININE INTERVENTION.
>> Jon: EXCELLENT POINT BY HOUSEOF COMMONS MEMBER GHOST OF JACOB
MARLEY.
HOLY. LISTEN AND LISTEN WELL!
THIS PARLIAMENT WILL BE VISITEDBY THREE GHOSTS.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: CAMERON, ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE THIS NUANCED CRITICISM?
>> THERE IS A CLEAR LEGALBASE FOR U.K. MILITARY ACTION
TO HELP IRAQ. THE IRAQIGOVERNMENT
HAS REQUESTED OUR HELP ANDGIVEN ITS CLEAR CONSENT FOR U.K.
MILITARY ACTION.THE FACT IS, THIS IS ABOUT
PSYCHOPATHIC TERRORISTS THAT ARETRYING TO KILL US.
THERE ISN'T AN OPTION OF JUSTHOPING THIS WILL GO AWAY.
>> Jon: WHAT? NOT A OPTION?
HOPING IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY?
IF I REMEMBER ENGLISHLITERATURE CORRECTLY,
HOPING SOMETHING GOES AWAYHAS BEEN THE NATIONAL STRATEGY
IN YOUR COUNTRY IN DEALING WITHEVERYTHING FROM CONSUMPTION TO
COLONIAL UPRISINGS TOHOMOSEXUALITY.
ALRIGHT.
SO GREAT, ENGLAND'S LAW MAKERSARE DEBATING
AND VOTING ON THISINCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.
WAIT, I MEANT TO SAY THAT'SGREAT,
ENGLAND'S LAW MAKERS AREDEBATING AND LAW MAKING ON THE
IMPORTANT ISSUE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BRING THESARCASM.
YOU KNOW, WE ARE HAVING ADEBATE TOO.
>> DO YOU THINK OUR CONGRESS,OUR LAW MAKERS SHOULD BE TAKING
IT UP AND DISCUSSING, DEBATINGIT .
>> WHY ISN'T THERE THE DEBATE INCONGRESS?
>> SHOULD CONGRESS COME BACK?
>> WHY ISN'T CONGRESS BACK ANDDEBATING THIS ISSUE?
>> IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE A BITOF REALLY AGGRESSIVE DEBATE.
>> Jon: SEE, IT'S A VERY VIBRANTDEBATE CENTERING AROUND SHOULD
WE OR SHOULD WE NOT-- HAVE A DEBATE.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: SO, WHY AREN'T WE
GETTING ALL PARLIAMENTARY ANDTALKING  ABOUT THIS?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULDCOME TO CONGRESS AND ASK FOR
AUTHORIZATION.
>> ABSOLUTELY I'M WILLING TO GOBACK.
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS ANOBLIGATION TO CALL US BACK
TOMORROW TO START THIS DEBATE.
>> IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ASKEDUS TO STAY LIKE DAVID CAMERON
ASKED PARLIAMENT TO COME BACKWE WOULD HAVE.
>> Jon: HE DIDN'T ASK. I WOULDOF COME BACK, BUT HE DIDN'T ASK.
IF WE HAD JUST COME BACK THATWOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE.
[LAUGHING]HE DIDN'T ASK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT MAKES SENSE.
THE WHOLE THING MAKES SENSE.
IT'S NOT LIKE CONGRESS CAN JUSTCALL ITSELF BACK INTO SESSION.
>> HARRY REID AND JOHN BOEHNERBOTH CAN CALL THEIR
RESPECTIVE CHAMBERSBACK TO CONGRESS.
>> Jon: YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD THEPOWER TO CALL BACK TO CONGRESS.
COME OUT, COME OUT WHEREVER YOUARE.
♪ LET IT GO. LET IT GO.DON'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE. ♪
[LAUGHING]
I SHOULD OF KNOWNSINGING "LET IT GO" WOULD MAKE
ME GO FLACID.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: SERIOUSLY, I'VE SEEN
THAT MOVIE LIKE A [BEEP]THOUSAND TIMES.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINTI CAN BUILD A [BEEP] SNOW MAN.
ALRIGHT.
SO CONGRESS, CONGRESS COULD RUSHBACK TO WASHINGTON AND DEBATE
THIS RIGHT NOW.
NOW I KNOW WHY HARRY REIDDOESN'T WANT TO.
HE THINKS OBAMA ALREADY HAS THEAUTHORITY TO DO WHATEVER THE
HELL HE WANTS.
BUT HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER, YOUBELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING ABOUT THIS ALL WRONG.
>> IF THE GOAL IS TO DESTROYISIS AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT
IS, I DON'T BELIEVE THE STRATEGYTHAT HE OUTLIED WOULD ACCOMPLISH
THAT.
>> WOULD YOU RECOMMEND PUTTINGAMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND?
>> WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
THESE ARE BARBARIANS. THEYINTEND TO KILL US, AND IF WE
DON'T DESTROY THEM FIRST, WE AREGOING TO PAY THE PRICE.
>> Jon: SO THE PRESIDENT HAS THEWRONG STRATEGY TO DESTROY
THE BARBARIANS WHO WILL KILL USALL. THE BARBARIANS AT OUR GATE,
OR NOT NECESSARILY OUR GATE BUTA FEW GATES AWAY AND THEN
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE OCEAN. BUTTHE POINT IS, SO I GET IT,
BOEHNER, LET'S HAVE THE DEBATEAND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.
>> JOHN BOEHNER SPEAKOF THE HOUSE SAID TODAY
I THINK THE HOUSE AND CONGRESSITSELF SHOULD SPEAK, BUT DOING
THIS WITH A WHOLE GROUP OFMEMBERS WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY
OUT THE DOOR, I DON'T THINK THATIS THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE THIS.
[LAUGHING]
>> Jon: YOU JUST SAID THEBARBARIANS WERE TRYING TO KILL
US. SETTING ASIDE THAT THANKS TOINCUMBENCY FAVORING ELECTORIAL
PRACTICES ROUGHLY 90% OFTHE MEMBERS WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY
OUT OF THE DOOR OF THESEMIDTERMS
WILL BE COMING RIGHT BACK INTHROUGH THE DOOR.
AND IF YOUR POINT IS THAT THESEARE RUTHLESS BARBARIANS WHO
THREATEN OUR VERY EXISTENCE ANDMUST BE KILLED IMMEDIATELY BY
THE NEW CONGRESS WHICH TAKESOVER IN JANUARY.
I MEAN, IS THERE SOMEONE WHOCOULD PERHAPS LAY OUT THE
CYNICAL UNDER PINNINGSOF THIS POSITION BY
OUR BRAVE CONGRESS.
>> JACK KINGSTON A REBULICANCONGRESSMAN FROM GEORGIA
HAD A VERY INTERESTING QUOTE INTHE NEW YORK TIMES YESTERDAY.
SO, "A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULDLIKE TO STAY ON THE SIDELINE AND
SAY 'JUST BOMB THE PLACE ANDTELL US ABOUT IT LATER .'
IT'S A ELECTION YEAR. A LOT OFDEMOCRATS DON'T KNOW HOW IT
WOULD PLAY IN THEIR PARTY.REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO CHANGE
ANYTHING. WE LIKE THE PATH WE'REON NOW. WE CAN
DENOUNCE IF IT GOES BAD ANDPRAISE IT IF IT GOES WELL
AND ASK THEM WHAT TOOK HIM SOLONG.
>> Jon: HOLY [BEEP].
IN A TIME OF WAR OURCONGRESSIONAL INACTION IS PURE
POLITICAL CALCULATION.
OUR LEGISLATORS REFUSE TODEBATE PUBLICLY ONE OF THE MOST
CRUCIAL ISSUES OF OUR TIME FORFEAR WE WILL HEAR THEM.
BUT FINALLY JACK KINGSTON HASTHE GUTS TO SAY OUT LOUD WHAT
THESE COWARDS ARE UP TO.
I WONDER WHY HE DECIDED TO SAYTHESE THINGS.
>> LAST NIGHT DAVID PERDUEDEFEATED CONGRESSMAN
JACK KINGSTON IN THE REPUBLICANSENATE PRIMARY RUN OFF.
>> Jon: OH, HE SPOKE HONESTLYBECAUSE HE'S LEAVING CONGRESS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE REST OF YOU[BEEP] EITHER GET BACK TO
WASHINGTON AND DEBATE AND VOTEON THIS THING
OR ELSE MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TELLMOM WE'RE MOVING HOME.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
