[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS PAKISTAN'SAMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES
FROM 2008 TO 2011.
HE IS CURRENTLY A PROFESSOR ATBOSTON UNIVERSITY.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED"MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS."  PLEASE
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAMHUSAIN HAQQANI.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS, THEPREMISE HERE IS THAT PAKISTANI
AND THE UNITED STATES ARE NOTREALLY ALLIES, THAT WE ARE --
HAVE A VERY UNCOMFORTABLERELATIONSHIP. IS THAT TRUE?
[LAUGHTER]>> LET ME SAY THAT AMERICANS
SOMETIMES MAKE A MISTAKE OFTHINKING THAT THE ONLY THING WE
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE REST OFTHE WORLD IS WHO DO WE SHOOT OR
WHO DO WE TAKE OUT FOR LUNCH.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARESOMETIMES MORE COMPLEX THAN
THAT.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> PAKISTAN IS JUST THE RIGHTCOUNTRY --
>> Jon: YOU ARE TELLING USTHIS NOW?
>> I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU 50YEARS AGO, TOO BUT YOU HAD TO
MAKE THE MISTAKES FOR ME TOWRITE THE BOOK.
>> Jon: LET ME SAY THIS INTRUE AMERICAN FASHION:  YOU'RE
WELCOME.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> THANK HAVE YOU VERY MUCH.
[LAUGHTER]-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK THESE AREMAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS AND
MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR DO WE BOTHREALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING
FROM OTHER SIDE?
>> IF THIS WAS A TRANSACTIONCLEARLY LAID OUT THERE  WOULD
HAVE BEEN LESSER PROBLEMS THANWE'VE HAD. ON MANY OCCASIONS AND
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN THEBOOK.
I DO KNOW HOW TO IN TRUEAMERICAN FASHION MAKE A PLUG FOR
THE BOOK.
PEOPLE HAVE TO READ IT.
>> Jon: SURE.
IT'S QUITE GOOD.
>> PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS TOLD BYTHE C.I.A. THAT PAKISTAN WAS
GOING AHEAD WITH ITS NUCLEARPROGRAM.
HE ASKED THE PAKISTANIDICTATORSHIP AT THE TIME THAT
WAS HELPFUL IN THE WAR AGAINSTTHE SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN.
THE GENERAL PUT HIS HAND ON HISHEART AND SAID NO WAY ARE WE
MAKING A NUCLEAR WEAPON ANDRONALD REAGAN SAID, ALL RIGHT,
OKAY, FINE I TAKE YOUR WORD FORIT.
THOSE ARE DELUSIONS.
WHY WOULD A COUNTRY GIVE UP ITSNUCLEAR PROGRAM UNLESS AND UNTIL
THE BENEFITS OF GIVING IT UPOUTWEIGHED THE BENEFITS OF
HAVING IT.
>> Jon: BECAUSE HE PUT HISHAND ON HIS HEART WHICH IS -- AS
YOU KNOW -- A BOND THAT CAN'T BEBROKEN.
>> I'M SURE THE GENERAL LEARNEDFROM --
>> Jon: I THINK YOU MIGHT BERIGHT.
SINCE 1947 WE'VE BEEN GIVING ATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AID TO
PAKISTAN WITH THE IDEA THAT THEYARE GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE
STRATEGIC ALLY AGAINST THESOVIETS, AGAINST NOW ISLAMIC
EXTREMISTS.
WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT THAT ISTHE CASE?
>> WELL -->> Jon: WHAT HAVE THEY
DELIVERED ON AND WHAT DO THEYWANT FROM US OTHER THAN THAT
MONEY?
>> YOU WERE TAKE BEING THEN.S.A. A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
THE N.S.A. AT ONE POINT IN THE1950'S.
THERE WERE NO SATELLITES.
THEY NEEDED A GROUND BASE FROMWHERE TO SPY ON THE SOVIET
UNION.
PAKISTAN OFFERED THEM ONE.
THE FLIGHTS USED TO TAKE OFFFROM A PLACE NEAR PESHAWAR IN
PAKISTAN.
THOSE KIND OF ADVANTAGES ARE THEQUID PRO QUO.
THE COST HAS BEEN ENORMOUS.
PAKISTAN HAS BECOME ARMOUS.
DYSFUNCTIONAL COUNTRY.
ALMOST 42% OF THE PAKISTANISCHOOL GOING AGE CHILDREN DON'T
GO TO SCHOOL.
YOU HAD MALALA HERE WHO SHOULDHAVE BEEN A HEROINE IN ANY OTHER
COUNTRY. SHE'SVILIFIED IN PAKISTAN BY SOME
PEOPLE.
THE ISLAMIST FUNDAMENTALISTS WHOWERE TRAINED TO FIGHT THE
SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN AREA NUISANCE FOR THE UNITED
STATES GLOBALLY AND AREAL THREAT TO PAKISTAN,AFGHANISTAN AND INDIA.
THE PROBLEM IS PAKISTAN'SLEADERSHIP FOCUSED ON ONE
THING HOW TO MAKE PAKISTANMILITARILY EQUAL TO INDIA.
THE AMERICANS ASSUMED IF WE GIVETHEM ENOUGH MILITARY EQUIPMENT
THEY'LL TURN AWAY FROM THATPURPOSE.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE BECAUSEPAKISTAN NEVER GAVE A SINGLE
SOLDIER TO FIGHT THESOVIETS EVEN THOUGH THEYKEPT ACCEPTING THE
AID ON THE PREMISE THEYWOULD HELP FIGHT THE SOVIET
UNION.
>> Jon: IN SOME RESPECTS WE'VEMADE THIS EXACT SAME DELUSION
WE'VE GIVEN THIS MONEY ANDMILITARY STRENGTH IN THE HOPES
OF BUILDING AN ALLY THAT WOULDNEVER TURN AROUND AND BITE US
AND PAKISTAN HAS USED THEISLAMIST MILITANTS IN THE EXACT
SAME FASHION, GIVING THEM MONEYAND ARMS IN THE HOPES THEY
WOULDN'T BITE THEM.
AREN'T WE SUFFERING FROM THESAME --?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HENCE THE PLURAL DELUSIONS.
THERE ARE DELUSIONS ON BOTHSIDES.
THE PAKISTANI MILITARY ISFIGHTING THE SAME PEOPLE IT
TRAIN AND ARMED.
THEY MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEENGOOD TALIBAN AND BAD TALIBAN.
THE DESIRE FOR INFLUENCE INN.
AFGHANISTAN REMAINS AMAJOR OBSESSION.
>> Jon: IS THIS THE REASON WHYEDUCATION IS SO DIFFICULT TO
COME BY IN PAKISTAN?
IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATEDCOUNTRY WITH SOPHISTICATED
PEOPLE AND BRIGHT PEOPLE, WHYWOULD THEY ALLOW 43% OF THEIR
PEOPLE NOT BE EDUCATED?
>> JON, PAKISTANIS ARE AWONDERFUL PEOPLE.
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I'M ONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN --
>> Jon: YEAH.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN OUR
GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY OURMILITARY.
WE INHERIT IT FROM THE BRITISHIN 1947 WHEN PARTITION OCCURRED.
ONE-THIRD OF BRITAIN INDIAN ARMYBUT ONLY 17% OF THE RESOURCES.
INSTEAD OF DECIDING THAT, YOUKNOW WHAT?
OUR MILITARY SHOULD BE TRIMMEDDOWN TO THE SIZE THAT WE CAN
AFFORD, WE ENDED UP SUPPORTINGIT.
EVEN NOW WHAT AMERICA HAS DONETO PAKISTAN IS THAT IT HAS
CREATED THIS DEPENDENCE INSTEADOF RAISING TAXES, INSTEAD OF
EXPORTING MORE, WE JUST WAIT FORASSISTANCE.
AND WE HAVE A VERY LARGEMILITARY.
WE HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
SO IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WHO ISJUST EXERCISING ONE ARM WHICH IS
THE MILITARY.
TOTALLY IGNORING EDUCATION.
IN 1947, IN WHAT IS TODAY INDIA,HAD 18% LITERACY. WHAT IS TODAY
PAKISTAN, 16. TODAY THATDIFFERENCE HAS BECOME A
20% DIFFERENCE.
THAT'S THE MISTAKE THAT HAPPENSWHEN FOREIGN POLICY IS MADE
BASED ON DELUSIONS.
>> Jon: LET ME SAY THIS AGAINYOU'RE WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: STICK AROUND FOR AMINUTE.
MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS.
ON BOOKSHELVES NOW.
