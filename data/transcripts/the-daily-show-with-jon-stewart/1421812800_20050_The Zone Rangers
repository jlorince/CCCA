BUT VERY LITTLE THAT FOX HASSAID HAS EVER SHOCKED ME
AS MUCH AS WHAT I SAW LASTSATURDAY.
>> LAST WEEK ON THIS PROGRAM AGUEST MADE A SERIOUS FACTUAL
ERROR THAT WE WRONGLY LET STANDUNCHALLENGED.
WE DEEPLY REGRET THESE ERRORSAND APOLOGIZE.
>> WE DEEPLY REGRET THE ERRORSAND APOLOGIZE.
>> WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE ERROR.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: I WILL BE DAMNED.
IT'S THE RARE FOXES CONTRITUS OFLEGEND.
NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE PROBABLYWONDERING WHAT DID THEY SAY

A NETWORK WIDE APOLOGY.
HOW BAD DOES [BEEP] HAVE TOSMELL BEFORE THE ORDER IS
DETECTED BY PEOPLE WHO LIVE ONA MOUNTAIN MADE OUT OF THAT
SUBSTANCE?
>> NEW DETAILS ABOUT HUNDREDS OFNO GO ZONES ACROSS FRANCE AND
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE OFFLIMITS TO NON MUSLIMS.
>> YOU BASICALLY HAVE ZONESWHERE SHARIA COURTS ARE SET UP.
THERE ARE ACTUAL CITIES LIKEBIRMINGHAM THAT ARE TOTALLY
MUSLIM.
WHERE NON MUSLIMS JUSTSIMPLY DON'T GO IN.
>> Jon: WOW.
BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND, IS TOTALLYMUSLIM AND NON MUSLIMS DON'T GO
IN.
THAT MUST BE SO INCONVENIENT FORTHE 78% OF BIRMINGHAM RESIDENTS
WHO ARE NOT MUSLIM.
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT FROM THE UKPERHAPS SOMEONE FROM
OVER THERE, MAYBE THEIRPRIME MINISTER WOULD
LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS.
>> WHEN I HEARD THIS, FRANKLY, ICHOKED ON MY PORRIDGE,
AND I THOUGHT IT MUST BEAPRIL FOOLS DAY.

[LAUGHING]
AASIF MANDVI FILED THIS REPORT.
>> CHRISTIANITY, IT'STHE DOMINANT RELIGION IN OUR
COUNTRY, BUT DID YOU KNOWIT'S ALSO IN SERIOUS TROUBLE?
NO, IT'S NOT GAYS, NOT SCIENCE,NOT LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD.
ACCORDING TO ALABAMA IT'SSHARIA LAW.
>> IN ALABAMA, VOTERS DECIDEWHETHER TO BAN SHARIA LAW.
>> AMENDMENT 1 OR THE SHARIA LAWAMENDMENT
WOULD PROHIBITJUDGES AND OTHER STATE OFFICIALS
FROM BASING ANY DECISIONS ONFOREIGN LAW.
IT'S PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY.
>> IT'S A THREAT SO IMMINENTTHAT ALMOST THREE QUARTERS
OF ALABAMA VOTED FOR THELAW FOR MANY OBVIOUS REASONS.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SHARIA LAW ISCOMPATIBLE AT ALL
WITH CHRISTIAN VALUES.
>> I DEFINITELY FEEL CHRISTIANVALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK IN
AMERICA.
>> WELL, AMERICA WAS FOUNDED ONJUDEO-CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES.
>> SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT PART OFSHARIA LAW IS ALABAMA
IN DANGER OF FALLING UNDER?
>> I THINK THAT IF WE'RE NOTDILIGENT AND WE DON'T STICK TO
OUR CONSTITUTION -->> RIGHT.
>> AND OUR LAWS THATANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
>> SO THE LAW IS ABOUTPROTECTING ALABAMA FROM
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN APROBLEM FOR ANYONE IN ALABAMA OR
ANY OTHER PART OF THE UNITEDSTATES BUT IT COULD BE.
>> IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT ANDNOT NEED IT THEN TO NEED IT
AND NOT HAVE IT.
>> EXACTLY.
BUT THAT SOUND LOGIC IS LOST ONLIBERALS.
LIKE SHARIA LAW APOLOGIST DR.RANDY BRINSON.
>> I THINK AMENDMENT ONE ISFRIVOLOUS.
IT WAS CONTRIVED OUT OF FEARMONGERING.
THERE IS NO THREAT OF SHARIA LAWBEING ENACTED.
>> OKAY, I GET IT. YOU'REAN ACLU ATHEIST COMING DOWN HERE
WITH YOUR NORTHEASTERN WAYS.
>> WELL, I HAVE LIVED IN ALABAMAFOR 25 YEARS.
I SUPPORTED GOVERNOR HUCKABEEWHEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT,
BUT I'M ALSO THE HEAD OF THECHRISTIAN COALITION OF ALABAMA.
>> WAIT, YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN?
>> YES.
>> ALRIGHT, CHRISTIAN.
JESUS CHRIST HE'S THE REASON FORTHE -- ?
>> FOR THE SEASON.
>> OKAY, JESUS' MIDDLE NAME?I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT, IT STARTS
WITH AN H.
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A MIDDLENAME.
>> JOHN 3:16 QUICK!>> FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD --
>> ALL RIGHT, FINE YOU'REA CHRISTIAN.
AND IN FACT, HE ADMITS THATSHARIA LAW TAKING OVER OUR
JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS A TOTALLYREAL POSSIBILITY.
>> THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TOHAPPEN UNLESS OUR COUNTRY
TOTALLY FALLS APART.
>> EXACTLY.
>> BUT THEN THE AMENDMENTTHAT YOU PUT IN THE CONSTITUTION
WOULDN'T BE IN PLACEANYWAY BECAUSE YOU
HAVE NO CONSTITUTION. DO YOU SEEWHAT I'M SAYING?
>> WHAT HE IS SAYING IS IT COULDHAPPEN!
IN FACT, IT MAY OF ALREADYBEGAN.
>> IT'S SLOWLY BECOMING, YOUKNOW, INTEGRATED INTO SOCIETY.
IT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THESCHOOLS.
THEY DON'T WANT US TO CELEBRATECHRISTMAS.
SO IT CAN HAPPEN, PEOPLE.
IT CAN HAPPEN.
>> IT MAKES SENSE. JUST LOOKAROUND.
WE COULD GO FROM ALABAMA TOAL-AHBAMA.
EVERYWHERE I LOOKED I SAWRADICAL ISLAM CREEPING IN.
OKAY THAT'S A KOREAN RESTAURANT,AND THAT'S SANTA CLAUS.
BUT THE POINT IS IT CAN HAPPEN,PEOPLE.
IT CAN HAPPEN.
>> IN YOUR TOWN A MOSQUE.
>> IT'S THE ALCAZAR TEMPLE.
IT'S THE SHRINERS TEMPLE.
>> YEAH, SHRINERS, SHIITES, IDON'T WHAT THEY CALL IT, OKAY?
>> NO. IT'S SHRINERS.>> IT'S ISLAM. IT'S A TYPE OF --
>> NO, IT'S NOT ISLAM.
>> SHRINER LAW, IT'S SIMILAR TOSHARIA LAW, I THINK.
>> NO.
THEY'RE A CLUB.
>> OKAY, SO NOT THIS. BUT THIS.
THE POINT IS, SHARIALAW IS UTTERLY
INCOMPATIBLE WITH OUR WAYOF LIFE.
>> WELL, IN SHARIA LAW, SOMEOF THE SEXUAL WHAT THEY CALL
DEVIANCES AND CRIMES CAN END INSTONING.
>> YEAH, EXACTLY. STONING.
AND THEY CONDONE SLAVERY.
AND YOU COULDN'T WEAR CLOTHES OFDIFFERENT FABRIC,
YOU COULDN'T EATPORK OR SHELLFISH.
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY.>> RIGHT.
>> OH [BEEP]. NO, THAT'S THEBIBLE.
>> I THINK YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUTTHE OLD TESTAMENT.
>> RIGHT, THAT'S JUST THE CRAZYPART OF THE BIBLE NOBODY PAYS
ATTENTION TO.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAYCHRISTIANITY DOES FACE A
VERY THREAT HERE IN ALABAMA.
>> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUTIT, ACTUALLY CHRISTIAN LAWS
COULD BE VIEWED AS "A FOREIGNLAW."
CHRISTIANITY COULD BE ADVERSELYAFFECTED BY THIS LAW.
>> OKAY, WOAH WOAH. CHRISTIANITYSTARTED IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> NO. IT ACTUALLY STARTED INJUDEA.
>> I BELIEVE IT DID. SO, DID YOUSAY JESUS IS  NOT AMERICAN?
>> NO.
>> DO AMERICANS KNOW THIS?
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELYRIGHT.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELYRIGHT, CHRISTIANITY IS UNDER
ATTACK BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKEYOU VOTING FOR LAWS LIKE THIS.
>> HOW IS THIS VOTING OF THISLAW ATTACKING CHRISTIANITY?
>> IT SEEMS THAT JESUS IS NOTFROM AMERICA.
HE'S A FOREIGNER.

YEP.
BUT IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED.
WE'RE SAYING NEW FOREIGN LAWS.
>> OH SO NEW FOREIGN LAWS?
>> YEAH, YEAH THERE YOU GO.
>> OLD FOREIGN LAWS  ARE FINE?
>> YEAH.
THAT'S THE ONE EXCEPTION WITHTHAT.
>> THAT'S THE ONE EXCEPTION.
>> EXACTLY. AN ESTABLISHEDCHRISTIAN NATION.
IT'S A NOTION OUR FOUNDINGFATHERS SO OBVIOUSLY SUPPORTED
WHEN THEY WROTE WE SHOULDABSOLUTELY NEVER DO THAT.
