[LAUGHTER]SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE
TODDLER PANDEMIC.
LET'S SAY ONE OF THESE KIDS DIDMANAGE TO SMUGGLE A GERM ACROSS
THE BORDER, WHAT THEN?
>> THEY'RE NOT BEING RELEASEDINTO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE
BEFORE THEY GO THROUGH A VERYTHOROUGH SCREENING AND THEY'RE
VACCINATED.
>> LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THEFACTS.
THE IMPORTANT THING ISTHAT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ARE
SCARY, AND WE'LL FIGURE OUTWHY. IN FACT, IMMIGRANTS IN
GENERAL. WE SENT OUR OWNMICHAEL CHE TO INVESTIGATE
EL GRANDE PELIGRO ON OUR BORDER.HERE'S HIS REPORT.
>> SINCE LATE LAST YEAR OVER50,000 IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM
WAR-TORN CENTRAL AMERICA ARRIVEDON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER,
REIGNITING A NATIONALCONVERSATION ABOUT OUR
IMMIGRATION POLICIES, OR TO PUTIT MORE SIMPLY --
>> WE'RE UNDER INVASION.
>> INVASION OF ILLEGALIMMIGRANTS.
>> THIS IS AGOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED INVASION
OF OUR COUNTRY.
>> JIM GILCHRIST, FOUNDER OF THEMINUTEMAN PROJECT.
>> IT'S A COVERT, ESSENTIALLY ATROJAN HORSE TYPE OF INVASION
INTO THE UNITED STATES.
>> THESE ARE CHILDREN, RIGHT?
>> YES, THEY ARE THE VANGUARD OFA MUCH, MUCH LARGER INVASION
WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE DEMISE OFOUR NATION AS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC
POWER.
>> CHILDREN?
>> YES.
BUT THEY ARE NOT COMING HERE TOKILL.
>> THEY'RE COMING HERE TO COLOR.
>> SURE, IF THEY WANT TO FINGERPAINT, SURE, BUT THEY CAN ALSO
DO THAT IN THEIR HOMELAND.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE AFTERAMERICAN FINGER PAINT, SO HE'S
ORGANIZING A NEW BORDEROFFENSIVE STARTING NEXT MAY HE'S
CALLING OPERATION NORMANDY.
>> WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MANEVERY POROUS AREA ALONG THE
BORDER FROM SAN DIEGO,CALIFORNIA TO, BROWNSVILLE,
TEXAS.
>> IF THIS IS OPERATION NORMANDYAND THE CHILDREN ARE INVADING
US, WOULDN'T THAT MAKE US THENAZIS?
>> THE REASON I NAMED ITOPERATION NORMANDY WAS TO SHOW
HOW LARGE THIS EVENT WILL BE.
>> I JUST THINK THERE ARE SOMANY GOOD WARS OUT THERE THAT
YOU COULD HAVE MADE ANANNOUNCEMENT.
I MEAN, WHY NOT THE ALAMO?
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
I MEAN, LITERALLY. IS THAT TOOON THE NOSE?
>> BUT AMAZINGLY, AMELIAMARADONOVICH OF THE U.S.
COMMITTEE FOR REFUGEES ANDIMMIGRANTS
ACTUALLY WELCOMESTHESE INVADERS.
>> WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ISOFFER PROTECTION TO THESE
CHILDREN WHO ARE FLEEING.
HONDURAS IS THE NUMBER-ONEMURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
>> YOU'RE TEACHING THEM TO RUNEVERY TIME SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO
MURDER THEM.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUSHOULD DO.
THEY ARE FLEEING WAR ANDVIOLENCE AND PERSECUTION.
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE WARZONES.
AND I THINK MOST OF THESECHILDREN COMING HERE USING
THOSE EXECUTIONS ARE LYING.
THEY'VE BEEN VERSED ON HOW TO DOIT.
TELL THEM YOU'RE A POLITICALREFUGEE.
TELL THEM THAT GANGBANGERS ARETRYING TO KILL YOU OR SAVE ME
AMERICA.
>> IT'S EITHER THAT OR THEY'REREALLY JUST REFUGEES.
>> YES.
THEY COULD BE REFUGEES OR THEYCOULD BE PART OF THE...
>> GIANT, ELABORATE PLAN?
>> RIGHT.
>> BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE LEGITREFUGEES, JIM UNDERSTANDS THESE
CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN POSE AUNIQUE THREAT TO OUR NATION.
>> AS THE LATINIZATION OFAMERICA CONTINUES ON, YOU'RE
GOING TO SEE SPANISH EQUAL TOENGLISH.
THEY WILL HAVE THE INFLUENCEOVER WHO IS GOING TO BECOME YOUR
DOGCATCHER, WHO IS GOING TOBECOME YOUR -- AND MAKING US
ESSENTIALLY JUST LIKE CHINA.YOU'LL SEE HISTORY BOOKS
PROBABLY REWRITTEN...>> YEAH.
>> WHERE THEALAMO NEVER EXISTED.
WELL, THAT'S A BUNCH OFBALDERDASH.
HISPANIC GANGS, BLACK GANGS ANDNOW WHITE GANGS, TOO.
>> NO?
>> YES.
>> NOT WHITE GANGS?
SO WHO WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH TOWELCOME IN PEOPLE LIKE THAT?
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ISASKING VERMONT TO LOOK INTO THE
POSSIBILITY OF HOUSING SOME OFTHOSE KIDS.
>> BUT IT MAY BE TOO LATE.
IT TURNS OUT VERMONT HAS BEENTAKING IN THESE ALAMO-DENYING,
DOG-CATCHER ELECTING REFUGEESFOR 25 YEARS.
AND WHEN I VISITED THIS GOATFARM RUN BY REFUGEES WHO CAME
HERE DECADES AGO, I WAS MET BY ATERRIFYING GANG THAT DIDN'T EVEN
SPEAK ENGLISH.
DEAR GOD, THE PEOPLE OF VERMONTNEEDED OPERATION NORMANDY MORE
THAN EVER.
>> OPERATION NORMANDY?
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE INVADING.
THEY'RE NOT INVADING.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BETTERLIFE.
>> WELL THIS IS ABOUT REFUGEESSNEAKING INTO THE COUNTRY AND
LYING THAT THEY'RE COMING FROMWAR-TORN COUNTRIES WHEN
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT?
>> YOU CAN JUST TELL.
I CAN JUST TELL.
THEY JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.
>> I'M A REFUGEE HERE.
>> YOU'RE A REFUGEE?
>> YES.
>> LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO BUYANY DRUGS.
>> OKAY.
>> JUST SAYING.
WHILE THIS PERSON CAN'T COME INBECAUSE OF THEIR COLOR OR THEIR
RACE.
>> NO, NOT BECAUSE OF THE COLOROR THE RACE BECAUSE OF WHERE
THEY'RE FROM AND THEIR COLOR ANDTHEIR RACE.
>> WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO STOPSOMEBODY FROM HAVING A BETTER
LIFE?
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TOHAVE IT HERE.
>> IF YOU CAN GET GOD TO SIGNTHAT, THEN EVERYBODY ELSE WILL.
>> IF I COULD GET GOD TO SIGNIT, I WOULDN'T BE HERE.
I'D BE ON "AMERICA'S GOTTALENT."
I NOW UNDERSTOOD HOW HARD ITMUST BE FOR JIM TO GET PEOPLE
EXCITED ABOUT CONFRONTINGHELPLESS CHILDREN.
>> WE'RE NOT THE SAME COUNTRYTODAY THAT WE WERE 40 YEARS AGO.
>> I AGREE WITH YOU. WE USED TOHATE IMMIGRANTS.
NOW SOME AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLYHELPING THEM.
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE,BUT THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE
HAVE BEEN CHILDREN IN ONECOUNTRY WHO
COULD NOT GET TO ANOTHERCOUNTRY.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE SOME DAY.
WE CAN'T STOP THAT.
I'M NOT GIVING A DEATH WISH ONTHESE CHILDREN COMING HERE
>> OK.>> OR THE ILLEGAL ALIENS.
I'M SAYING THAT THERE'S SOMETHINGS REALISTICALLY YOU CANNOT
STOP.>> I'M JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO
NOT SAY ANYTHING AND WATCH YOUBE UNCOMFORTABLE.
