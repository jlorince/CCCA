>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MYGUEST TONIGHT,
WE'RE VERY EXCITED. MY GUESTTONIGHT, RAMITA NAVAI.
SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF "CITY OFLIES."
I DON'T WANT THE GIVE ANYTHINGAWAY, IT TURNS OUT EVERYBODY
IS LYING. YOU DON'TWANT TO KNOW.
BUT, FIRST WE TURNTO WASHINGTON, D.C., HOME
OF OUR NATION'S MOSTRESPECTED INSTITUTIONS
AND ALSO THE GOVERNMENT.
>> AMERICANS HAVE A VERY LOWOPINION OF CONGRESS, AND THIS
NEXT STORY PROBABLY IS NOTGOING TO HELP THAT VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: OH, CHRIST.
WHAT DID CONGRESS DO THIS TIME?
WHAT DID THEY KILL A VETERANS'BILL TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT FOOD
STAMPS OR OUTLAW TAN BECAUSE THEPRESIDENT WORE THE COLOR?
OR, WHAT DID THEY KICK A PUPPYIN AN ELEVATOR?
WHAT DID THEY DO?
>> NEW YORK'S JUNIOR SENATORKIRSTEN GILLIBRAND SAYS SHE'S
BEEN THE TARGET OF SOME VERYINAPPROPRIATE SEXIST COMMENTS
RIGHT IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.
>> Jon: NOT JUST SEXISTCOMMENTS, INAPPROPRIATE SEXIST
COMMENTS.
THAT'S MY LEAST FAVORITE KIND OFSEXIST COMMENT.
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
THE SENATE IS AN AUGUST BODY, ITIS THE SAUCER THAT COOLS THE HOT
TEA OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
CONGRESS IT'S ITS UPPERHOUSE.
SURELY SEXISM, EVEN THEINAPPROPRIATE KIND, IS BENEATH
THEM.
>> SHE SAYS AN OLDER MALECOLLEAGUE TOLD HER THAT, "GOOD
THING YOU'RE WORKING OUTBECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO GET PORKY."[AUDIENCE REACTS].
>> Jon: BY PORK I ASSUME THEGENTLEMAN WAS REFERRING TO
APPROPRIATIONS TARGETED TO HERLOCAL CONSTITUENTS.
>> ONE OF HER FELLOW SENATEMEMBERS APPROACHED HER,
SQUEEZED HER STOMACH AND SAID,"DON'T LOSE TOO MUCH WEIGHT,
NOW. I LIKE MY GIRLS CHUBBY."
>> Jon: DON'T GET TOO PORKY.I LIKE MY GIRLS CHUBBY.
EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO
[BLEEPED] SEXISM, THE SENATE ISGRIDLOCKED.
THEY CAN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.
LUCKILY THERE'S ALWAYS ONEASSHOLE LEFT.
TO BREAK THE TIE.
>> THE PRIZE COMMENT, SHEWRITES, CAME FROM A SOUTHERN
CONGRESSMAN, WHO SAID, AS HEHELD MY ARM, "YOU KNOW, KIRSTEN,
YOU'RE EVEN PRETTY WHEN YOU'REFAT."
>> Jon: OH, YEAH, YES, THEGENTLEMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE
OF AROUSAL YIELDS THE REMAINDEROF HIS BONER TO THE
GENTLEWOMAN FROM NEW YORK.NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THESE
COMMENTS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE INANY CONTEXT,
BUT THERE IS A CERTAINIRONY TO BEING JUDGED ON ONE'S
PHYSICAL APPEARANCE BY A GROUPOF MEN WHO, IF YOU SQUINT, LOOK
ON A GOOD DAY LIKE A BOWL OFDRIED FRUIT.
APPLE CHIPS. IT'S MOSTLY APPLECHIPS. I GUESS I'M JUST SAYING,
HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE: IF C-SPAN2 WERE TO AIR CLOSE-UPS FROM THE
HIT SHOW "PUPPETRY OF THEPENIS," VIEWERS MIGHT CALL IN
AND SAY, "HEY, YOU GUYSARE LOOKING GOOD." CAUSE THEY
LOOK WORSE THAN SOMEONE'S BALLSIS WHAT I'M SAYING.
I'M SAYING THAT SOME SENATORS,IF YOU SQUINT AND LOOK CLOSELY,
AND THERE'S A CLOSE-UP, THEYLOOK LIKE SOMEONE'S BALLS.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. I AMSAYING THAT.
I'M NOT GOING TO NAME NAMES,
BUT OUR SENATE IS FILLED WITHPEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE BALLS.
[LAUGHTER]OBVIOUSLY THE MALE SENATORS
IN THIS STORY DID SOMETHINGDESPICABLE, BUT ISN'T THERE
A WAY KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND COULDALSO BE IN THE WRONG?
>> WHY WOULDN'T KIRSTENGILLIBRAND NAME NAMES?
>> DOESN'T SHE HAVE ARESPONSIBILITY TO NAME NAMES?
I THINK SHE SHOULD.
>> IF YOU'VE GOT THE GUTS TOWRITE ABOUT IT, HAVE THE GUTS TO
NAME THE NAMES.
>> Jon: YES, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEGROWN-UP VERSION OF THE RICH KID
FROM EVERY '80s MOVIE HAS APOINT. WHY WOULDN'T,
WHY WOULDN'T THE WOMAN MAKINGTHE LARGER POINT ABOUT THE
GENERAL CULTURE OF WASHINGTONNOT TURN THIS INTO A NARROW
PERSONAL ATTACK ON THE PEOPLESHE SEES AT WORK EVERY DAY.
MAYBE THIS SENATOR GILLIBRANDJUST HAPPENED TO RUN ACROSS A
COUPLE JERKS.
PROBABLY MOST WOMAN WOULD BEVERY SURPRISED TO HEAR ABOUT
THESE INCIDENTS.
>> IT'S NOT SURPRISING. ITREALLY ISN'T.
>> IT DOESN'T COME AS ASURPRISE.
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.
>> I GOT SOME COMMENTS THATWOULD JUST MAYBE BLOW YOU AWAY.
>> WE ALL HAD OUR STORIES OFWHOM YOU WOULD NOT GET ON
AN ELEVATOR WITH.
[AUDIENCE REACTS].
>> Jon: RIGHT. WE ALL HAVE OURSTORIES ABOUT WHICH PERSON
ELECTED BY VOTERS IN THEIRSTATE TO A SIX-YEAR TERM, VESTED
WITH THE POWERS TO ADVISE,CONSENT, AND DECLARE WAR, YOU
WOULD NOT TRUST IN THE THREE TOFIVE SECONDS IT TAKES
TO GO FROM TWO TO L.
BUT DON'T WORRY, GUYS, JUSTBECAUSE SENATOR BUZZKILL CAN'T
HANDLE A FRIENDLY ABDOMINALGROPING, AT LEAST SOME WOMEN
STILL APPRECIATE THE FINEART OF THE CAT CALL.
>> MEN ARE GOING TO BE THAT WAY.
WHAT CAN YOU DO?
THEY MEAN IT IN A NICE WAY, ITHINK.
>> IT USED TO BOTHER ME.
OH, THIS IS SO SEXIST.
NOW I'M LIKE, IF IT DOESN'THAPPEN, I'M LIKE EXCUSE ME.
>> WHY NOT? >> JUST AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T COMEWITHIN ARM'S-LENGTH, IT'S GOOD.
>> BUT THEN, IF YOU CAN'T GETINTO A CAB OR YOU'RE STUCK
THERE, THEN IT GETS OUT OFCONTROL.
OR IF I HAVE MY LITTLE BOY THERETHEN YOU'RE LIKE, HE'S KIND OF
USED TO IT AT THIS POINT.
[AUDIENCE REACTS].
>> Jon: EH, EVERYBODY WANTS TO[BLEEPED] MY MOM.
[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]
ANYWAY, TAKE THE PAR.
IS THERE NO WAY FOR A THOUGHTFULGENTLEMAN TO APPROPRIATELY
CONVEY HIS APPRECIATION OF AWOMAN OF THE FEMININE GENDER.
>> IF THE MOMENT STRIKES ME,THIS IS MY MOVE.
I'M GOING TO SAY, VERY SLOW,JUST LIKE THIS.
[LAUGHTER]AND YOU KNOW, YOU WALK BY, AND
JUST THE CLAPPING, AND I WOULDSAY THE SUCCESS RATE IS ABOUT
90% YOU GET A SMILE.
>> Jon: CAUSE IT'S CLASSY.YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M OUT
THERE YELLING, "YO, BABY, I'M AMOTORBOAT, LET'S MAKE THE LONG
ISLAND SOUND, BECAUSE THAT WOULDBE PRESUMPTUOUS."
