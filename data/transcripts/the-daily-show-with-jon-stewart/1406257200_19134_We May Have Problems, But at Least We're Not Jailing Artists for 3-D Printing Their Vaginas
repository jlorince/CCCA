>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
NOW, IT TURNS OUT NEW YORK ISNOT THE ONLY PLACE DEALING WITH
THE REGIONAL CULTURE SPECIFICCRIME. JAPAN, WHERE ARTIST
MEGUMI IGARASHI WASARRESTED LAST WEEK FOR
DISTRIBUTING PLANS TO 3-D PRINTMODELS OF HER OWN VAGINA,
THUS BREAKING JAPANESEOBSCENITY LAWS.
HUH?
FIRST OF ALL, JAPAN HASOBSCENITY LAWS?
YOU ARRESTED HER FOR THAT?
I MEAN, COME ON.
YOU GOT HAVE A BACK-UP VAGINA INCASE THE FIRST ONE CRASHES.
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.
IGARASHI'S CASE IS THE SUBJECTOF OUR NEW SEGMENT, "WE MAY HAVE
PROBLEMS BUT AT LEAST WE'RE NOTJAILING ARTISTS FOR 3-D PRINTING
THEIR VAGINAS," BROUGHTTO YOU BY DECADES OF DEEP SEXUAL
REPRESSION AND FISHCAKES.
MMM.
FISHCAKES.
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLYWONDERING, WHY WOULD SOMEONE
SELL 3-D MODELS OF THEIR VAGINA?
WELL, DUH. [LAUGHTER]
TO RAISE MONEY TO 3-DPRINT AN EVEN BIGGER MODEL OF
HER VAGINA,SPECIFICALLY A VAGINA-SHAPED
BOAT, WHICH IF I'M NOTMISTAKEN IS ALSO THE PLOT OF
"FIELD OF DREAMS."
I NEVER SAW IT. AH MAYBE...
NOW, IGARASHI HAS SINCE BEENRELEASED FROM JAIL.
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REAL STORYHERE.
THE REAL STORY IS THAT THISHAPPENED IN JAPAN, A COUNTRY
WHOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMINGINCLUDES SUCH CLASSICS AS "GUYS
IN THEIR UNDERWEAR SPINNING AGIANT WHEEL THAT SLOWLY
UNDRESSES A WOMAN, AND WOMENCOMPETEING TO SEE HOW MUCH
CHANGE THEY CAN HOLD IN THEIRCLEAVAGE."
APPARENTLY THAT'S TOTALLY COOL.
[LAUGHTER]INCIDENTALLY, JAPAN,
CONGRATULATIONS ON INVENTINGSOMETHING SOMEHOW MORE DEMEANING
THAN ACTUAL PORNOGRAPHY.
PLEASE TAKE THAT PICTURE DOWNBEFORE SOMEONE BUYS THE AMERICAN
RIGHTS TO THAT SHOW.
I DON'T GET HOW A COUNTRYCHEIFLY FAMOUS FOR SUPERIOR
TECHNOLOGY, AND LET'S CALL ITCREATIVE SEXUALITY, HAS SEEN THE
PERFECT COMBINATION OF THOSE TWOTALENTS AND DECIDED, NO, THAT'S
TOO FAR.
ON THE JAPANESE PERVOMETER, THEVAGINA BOAT IS PRACTICALLY A
DISNEY WORLD RIDE.
BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULD SEE THELINE AT THAT RIDE.
[LAUGHTER]HERE'S WHAT REALLY GETS ME,
JAPAN, IT'S NOT THAT I LOVEVAGINA-THEMED BOATS,
ALTHOUGH, YES, I DO KEEP ONEDOWN THE SHORE. NO, WHAT GETS ME
IS YOUR PUBLIC DISPLAY OFGENITAL DOUBLE STANDARD.
>> EVERY SPRING IN JAPAN, PEOPLETRAVEL TO KAWASAKI FOR A
FESTIVAL THAT IS LIKE NO OTHER.CALLED THE FESTIVAL OF THE
STEEL PHALLUS. AS IN ERECTPENIS.
THE FESTIVAL FEATURES PEOPLEMARCHING AND DANCING THROUGH THE
STREETS, PARADING AROUNDGIGANTIC PENIS SHAPED MIKOSHI.
>> Jon: LOOK, HEY, I UNDERSTANDTHESE PENISES ARE PROUD OF THEIR
CULTURE, BUT DO THEY HAVE TO BESO LOUD AND HAVE A PARADE?
COME ON.
THAT'S MY NEW CHARACTER, GUY WHOIS PREJUDICE AGAINST PENIS
CULTURE.
JAPAN, YOU ARRESTED A WOMAN FOR3-D PRINTING HER VAGINA, BUT
YOU GAVE DICKS THEIR OWNHOLIDAY.
[LAUGHTER]I GUESS IF YOU COMMUTE TO THE
DONG PARADE IN YOUR VAGINA BOAT,YOU GO TO JAIL.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINSTVAGINAS?
>> THE LEGEND GOES AS SUCH: AWOMAN HAD A DEMONIC PENIS-EATING
VAGINA THAT REMAINED UNDEFEATEDUNTIL A BLACKSMITH INVENTED AN
INDESTRUCTIBLE IRON PHALLUS THATSHATTERED THE DEMON'S TEETH.
[LAUGHTER]>> I COULD SEE HOW THAT WOULD
LEAVE SOME ILL FEELINGS.
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, JAPAN, I DON'T WANT TOTELL YOU HOW THE RUN YOUR
COUNTRY, BUT JUST THINK ABOUT ITTHIS WAY: AMERICA HAS A LONG
TRADITION OF ALLOWING ITS FEMALEARTISTS TO EXPRESS THEIR
INNERMOST THOUGHTS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE DON'T SPEND51 WEEKS A YEAR STORING A GIANT
STEEL DICK IN OUR GARAGE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
