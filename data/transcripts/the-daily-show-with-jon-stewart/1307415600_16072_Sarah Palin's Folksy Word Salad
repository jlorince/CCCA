(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WE CONTINUE DOMESTIC POLITICS.
NOW WE ALL SARAH PALIN'S NADA
PRESIDENT SHL BID, NOTHING TO
SEE OTHER THAN THIS GUMBO
RALLY.
WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT THIS
THING IS ROAD TRIP.
PEOPLE WONDER WHAT IS IT ABOUT
SARAH PALIN?
WHY SO DIVISIVE.
ON FRIDAY SHE WAS AT A BAKERY
IN BOSTON AND OFFERED UP HER
VERSION OF THE FAMOUS MIDNIGHT
RIDE OF PAUL REVERE A MAJOR
LANDMARK OF WHICH SHE HAD JUST
VISITED.
>> HE WHO WARNED US THE
BRITISH, THAT THEY WEREN'T
GOING TO BE TAKING AWAY OUR
ARMS BY RINGING THOSE BELLS
AND MAKING SURE THAT HE'S
RIDING HIS HORSE THROUGH TOWN
TO SEND THOSE WARNING SHOTS
AND BELLS THAT WE WERE GOING
TO BE SECURE AND WE WERE GOING
TO BE FREE.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE
JUST SAID BUT SHE APPEARS TO
HAVE TAKEN A WELL KNOWN
HISTORICAL EVENT AND TURNED IT
INTO A FOLKSY TALE.
THERE WAS ENOUGH ADJACENT
THINGS.
WHO REALLY ACTUALLY CARES?
THIS IS THE PART THAT DRIVES
PEOPLE A LITTLE BONKERS.
>> YOU REALIZE YOU MESSED UP
ABOUT PAUL REVERE, DON'T YOU?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN'T
MESS UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE.
>> Jon: RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S THE THING.
THAT'S THE PALIN... YOU DO A
LITTLE OFF-THE-CUFF JUMBO AND
THEN YOU GO ON TV TWO DAYS
LATER AND YOU'RE WEARING
SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU ROBBED A VATICAN OR
ABOUT TO MARRY JESUS IN LAS
VEGAS.
THEN YOU INSIST THAT YOU
INSIST THAT YOU MEANT TO SAY
YOU WERE RIGHT AND YOU WERE
THE VICTIM OF SOME AWARENESS.
>> IN A SHOUT-OUT GOTCHA TYPE
OF QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF
ME I ANSWERED CANDIDLY.
I KNOW MY AMERICAN HISTORY.
>> Jon: IT WAS A GOTCHA
QUESTION.
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?
>> I'M GOING TO REPEAT THE
GOTCHA QUESTION.
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR
TODAY AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR VISIT?
>> Jon: HERE'S A TIP.
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOTCHA
QUESTION, IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
A GOTCHA QUESTION JUST BECAUSE
IT GOT-YA.
BY THE WAY I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.
