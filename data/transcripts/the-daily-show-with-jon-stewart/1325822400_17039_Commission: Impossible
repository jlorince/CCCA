>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, CRAIG
SHIRLEY.
AUTHOR CRAIG SHIRLEY, AUTHOR
OF THE NEW BOOK DECEMBER
1941, BEST-SELLER, NOVEMBER
1941.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
PRESIDENT, THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH OF THIS UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT.
IN RECENT WEEKS, MONTHS
THERE HAVE BEEN EXPANSIONS
OF EXECUTIVE POWER THAT MANY
HAVE FOUND TROUBLING.
BUT PERHAPS LACKED THE
HYPERBOLIC VOCABULARY TO
PROPERLY CONDEMN, YOUR
PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.
>> REPUBLICANS CALL IT AN
UNPRECEDENTED POWER GRAB.
>> IT WHAT INTEMPORATE,
ARROGANCE AND IRRESPONSIBLE.
>> ARROGANCE OF POWER, ABUSE
OF POWER.
>> WHO CARES WHAT THE LAW
SAYS WHO CARES WHAT THE
RULES ARE, I'M THE
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: FINALLY, ELECTED
OFFICIALS IN OUR
PUNDITOCTOBER CRASSEE
STANDING UP AGAINST I'M
ASSUMING THE RECENT KODD
FIING OF INDEFINITE
DETENSION OF AMERICANS OR
PERHAPS THE UNRESTRICTED AND
SECRET USE OF DRONES THAT
RAIN DEATH FROM THE SKY OR
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT'S MOST
RECENT OUTRAGE, THE
INSTITUTION OF MANDATORY
SHARIA SCHOOL LUNCH WHERE
EVEN THE MOST AMERICAN OF
SANDWICHES, PB & J MUST WEAR
THE HIJAB SO WHICH ONE OF
THESE ALL TRUE THINGS ARE
THEY OBJECTING TO?
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NAMING
RICHARD CORDRAYS AHEAD OF
THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL
PROTECTION BUREAU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HUH?
SO CONGRESS CREATED A BUREAU
TO PROTECT CONSUMERS
FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN
20150.
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS NOT TWO
YEARS LATER, HIRING SOMEONE
TO RUN IT.
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER DOTH
COME HE IS.
HOW IS FILLING A POSITION
THAT CONGRESS CREATED AN
ARROGANT, LAWLESS AND BANANA
REPUBLIC ABUSE OF POWER.
THAT'S USE OF POWER.
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT DO
THAT WAS SO WRONG?
>> THE PRESIDENT ACTED UNDER
HIS AUTHORITY TO MAKE RECESS
APPOINTMENTS WHEN CONGRESS
IS NOT IN SESSION.
>> MY GOD.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S HOW HITLER TOOK
POLAND.
LOOK, GEORGE W BUS, DID
PLENTY OF RECESS APPOINT
OTMENTS.
HOW BOLLTON BECAME U.N. AM
WAS DO CHUCK NORRIS BECAME
6thsDmÃ§
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT OBAMA
JUST DID.
>> THE REPUBLICANS SAY THE
SENATE IS ACTUALLY IN
SESSION, AND THE PRESIDENT
HAD NO RIGHT TO MAKE THE
SO-CALLED RECESS
APPOINTMENT.
>> Jon: WAIT, THE SENATE IS
IN SESSION?
I WATCHED C-SPAN FOR
LIVING AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
THEM IN SESSION.
WHAT'S THAT?
I MISSED IT.
WHAT DOW MEAN I MISSED IT, A
CONGRESSIONAL SESSION, IT'S
NOT LIKE A SHOOTING STAR,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM
AND MISS-- TURN ON C-SPAN.
SHOW ME THEIR SESSION AND
WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT I'M
GOING TO JUST TRY AND OPEN
THIS CHILDPROOF BOTTLE OF
ASPIRIN.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN --
>> THE SENATE WILL COME TO
ORDER.
PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION,
THE HOUR OF 12:00 NOON
JANUARY 3rd-- SENATE NOW
STANDS ADJOURNED UNTIL 11
A.M. ON FRIDAY JANUARY 6TH,
2012.
>> Jon: PUSH DOWN AND-- HOLY
[BLEEP] DID I MISS IT AGAIN!
THAT WAS THE WHOLE
CONGRESSIONAL SESSION?
THAT COUNTS FOR TO THE BEING
IN RECESS?
SO THE PRESIDENT BID THE
ARCANE RECESS APPOINTMENT
AND THE SENATE RAISES HIM A
TECHNICAL BYLAW ADHERENCE,
THE PRO FORMA SENATE SESSION.
WELL PLAYED GAME
