THERE'S A... I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE SEEN, THERE'S THESE GREAT
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS
ABOUT BULLYING GAY TEENS.
ONE RELEASED LAST WEDNESDAY
REALLY CAUGHT MY EYE.
>> BULLYING HAS LED TO AN
EPIDEMIC OF SUICIDES.
>> WHAT'S CONVINCING THESE KIDS
THINGS WON'T GET BETTER.
>> LOOK AROUND.
>> OUR POLITICAL LEADERS TELL
LBGTs THEY HAVE NO FUTURE,
THEY CAN'T SERVE OUR COUNTRY
OPENLY.
>> THAT WAS CINDY McCAIN, JOHN
McCAIN'S RIDICULOUSLY HOT LADY
FRIEND.
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S REFUTING
SENATOR McCAIN'S STANCE ON
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL," NOT
THAT JOHN McCAIN IS CLOSED
MIND ON THE SUBJECT.
>> THE DAY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
MILITARY COMES TO ME AND SAYS,
SENATOR, WE OUGHT TO CHANGE THE
POLICY, I THINK WE OUGHT TO
CONSIDER CHANGING IT.
>> FOR TEN YEARS THE STRAIGHT
TALK HAS BEEN WAITING FOR A CUE
FROM MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO
BECOME JUST THE EXPRESS.
THEN LAST SPRING...
>> THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HE
WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS THIS
YEAR TO REPEAL THE LAW KNOWN AS
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL."
I FULLY SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S
DECISION.
>> ALLOWING GAYS AND LESBIANS TO
SERVE OPENLY WOULD BE THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.
>> Jon: THAT LOOKED A LOT LIKE
THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP.
>> HE WAS SPEAKING "PERSONALLY."
JUST THIS WEEK THE COMMANDANT OF
THE MARINE CORPS SAID HE DID NOT
WANT "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
REPEALED.
>> Jon: SO YOU GOT GENERAL
CASE AND MULLINS, BUT WHAT ABOUT
GENERAL HALFTRACK OR GRIEVOUS OR
LEE.
[CONFEDERATE MUSIC PLAYING]
STILL, SENATOR McCAIN, BIG
LINEUP OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP.
TIME TO START THINKING ABOUT
REPEAL, RIGHT?
UNLESS THERE IS ANOTHER
CRITERION THAT YOU NEED TO
SATISFY YOU.
>> WE'LL GO THROUGH A YEAR LONG
STUDY THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ALSO
HAVE THE FEELINGS OF THE MEN AND
WOMEN THAT ARE SERVING.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND A
STUDY.
IT'S THE MAV RICK WAY, SPEND A
YEAR DECIDING WHETHER SOLDIERS
DESERVE FULL RIGHTS BUT HALF
HOUR ON WHO WILL BE YOUR
PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE.
OH, BUT WAIT, IT'S ALL ABOUT
PRIORITIES.
McCAIN SAID HE WANTED TO DO
THAT STUDY A YEAR AGO AND IT'S
BEEN ALMOST A YEAR.
>> THE PENTAGON STUDY ON "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL" SHOWS THAT MORE
THAN 70% OF PEOPLE IN THE
MILITARY THINK THAT IT WOULD BE
OKAY TO END THE POLICY.
>> Jon: SO McCAIN, I GUESS
WE'RE GOOD NOW.
>> I WILL LISTEN, AS I'VE SAID
FOR YEARS, TO OUR MILITARY
LEADERS, AND NOT A STUDY THAT IS
LEAKED.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: BUT THE LEADERSHIP
ALREADY AND THEN THE...
>> ONCE WE GET THIS STUDY, WE
NEED TO HAVE HEARINGS AND WE
NEED TO EXAMINE IT AND WE NEED
TO LOOK AT WHETHER IT'S THE KIND
OF STUDY THAT WE WANTED.
>> YOU WERE THERE WHEN THEY
PROPOSED THE STUDY!
YOU WERE SITTING IN THE ROOM
WITH THEM.
WHAT KIND OF STUDY DID YOU WANT?
>> I WANTED A STUDY TO DETERMINE
THE EFFECTS OF THE REPEAL ON
BATTLE EFFECTIVENESS AND MORALE.
>> Jon: THAT WAS THE TITLE OF
THE STUDY!
AS FOR CINDY McCAIN, HER
P.S.A. CAME OUT LAST WEDNESDAY
AND IT TOOK HER ALL THE WAY
UNTIL FRIDAY TO DECLARE A
TWITTER THAT WHILE SHE SUPPORTS
THE NO HATE CAMPAIGN ALSO STANDS
BY HER HUSBAND'S STANCE "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL" BECAUSE SHE'S
AGAINST WHAT "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL" DOES BUT SHE'S FOR "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL."
NO WONDER THEY HAVE SO MANY
HOUSES.
THEY NEED THEM TO KEEP ALL THEIR
DIFFERENT BELIEFS IN THEM.
HONEY, WHERE'S MY IMMIGRATION
POLICY?
[IN FEMININE VOICE]: IN PALM
SPRINGS.
[IN MALE VOICE]: WHERE'S THE WAR
ONE?
>> [IN FEMININE VOICE]: YOU LEFT
IT AT THE BEACH HOUSE.
AS I SEE JOHN McCAIN DOING
NOTHING TO REPEAL "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL," IT REMINDS ME.
>> SENATOR McCAIN, WE KNOW
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A TOUGH
TIME WITH THIS "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL," TRUST ME, IT GETS WORSE.
>> THE HEAD OF THE MILITARY
DOESN'T AGREE WITH YOU.
YOUR OWN WIFE DOESN'T AGREE WITH
YOU.
YOUR OWN WIFE.
HOLY [BLEEPED].
>> SHE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE, BUT
THAT'S IRRELEVANT TO THIS
DISCUSSION.
>> BUT IT GETS WORSE BECAUSE
SOONER OR LATER GAY PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO WIND UP SERVING, AND
THEN 20 YEARS LATER THEY'LL MAKE
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT, AND YOU
KNOW HOW EVERY DOCUMENTARY ABOUT
SOME BIG SOCIAL CHANGE HAS A BAD
GUY.
>> THE GUY WHO FOUGHT IT TOOTH
AND NAIL LONG AFTER IT WAS
OBVIOUS THE EVERYONE ELSE WHAT
NEEDED TO BE DONE.
YOU KNOW, THE GEORGE WALLACE
CHARACTER?
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU.
>> SAYING STUFF LIKE BLACK
PEOPLE DON'T BELONG IN A WHITE
MAN'S MILITARY.
>> OR I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH
CATHOLICS.
>> I JUST DON'T WANT ONE IN THE
WHITE HOUSE ON A SPECIAL POPE
PHONE TO ROME.
>> OR A LADY ASTRONAUT, WON'T
THE GAZANGAS GET IN THE WAY.
>> AND THE NARRATOR WILL SAY,
"SENATOR JOHN McCAIN FOUGHT
THE MOVE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,
USING OBVIOUS STALLING TACTICS."
>> ALTHOUGH THEY'LL PROBABLY
PICK SOMEONE WITH A BETTER VOICE
THAN JOHN.
>> YOU KNOW WHY, WYATT, GO
[BLEEPED] YOURSELF.
>> IT WILL BE PART OF YOUR
LEGACY.
>> IT DOES GET WORSE.
>> IT GETS
