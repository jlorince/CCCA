>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS AFOREIGN AFFAIRS JOURNALIST.
HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "CITY OFLIES: LOVE, SEX, DEATH AND THE
SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN TEHRAN."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOWRAMITA NAVAI.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: LOOK AT THIS HERE. WE'VEGOT THERE
"CITY OF LIES: LOVE,SEX, DEATH AND THE SEARCH FOR
TRUTH IN TEHRAN."AREN'T ALL CITIES, AND I LIVE
IN NEW YORK, I'VE LIVED HERE FORA LONG TIME,
AREN'T ALL CITIES -- ISN'TTHAT WHY WE COME TO CITIES,
BECAUSE THEY'RE FILLED WITHLIES?
>> YES, IT'S TRUE, BUT LYINGTAKES ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL
IN TEHRAN.
AND BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE ISOPPRESSIVE, BECAUSE IRANIANS
HAVE BEEN LIVING FOR 30 YEARSUNDER A FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC
REGIME, EVERYTHING IS MUCH MOREEXAGGERATED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO LIES, JUST EVERY DAY, ANDTHEY'RE FILTERED INTO SOCIETY.
AND THEY'RE FILTERED INTOEVERYDAY LIFE IN A WAY THAT THEY
DON'T HERE.
>> Jon: NOW IT'S INTERESTINGBECAUSE EACH, SO YOU LAY IT OUT
IN TERMS OF THESE INCREDIBLYFASCINATING PROFILES OF
INDIVIDUALS. NOW, THISCOUNTRY DOES -- YOU KNOW,
THERE STILL IS THAT PUSH ANDPULL BETWEEN LIBERALISM AND
CONSERVATISM, SECULARISM ANDRELIGION, HEDONISM AND
ABSTINENCE IN THISCOUNTRY, AS WELL.
IT'S INTERESTING TO KNOW THATHAVING THAT GOVERNMENT HAS NOT
CHANGED THAT IN IRAN.
>> YES.
AND I THINK WHAT I WAS TRYINGTO DO WITH THE BOOK IS, YOU'RE
RIGHT.
SO, THERE ARE THESE TWO VERYSEPARATE WORLDS.
AND IN TEHRAN ITSELF, IT'S QUITEGEOGRAPHIC, AS WELL.
KIND OF NORTH IS LIBERAL, RICH,KIND OF MORE SECULAR.
SOUTH IS KIND OF WORKING CLASS,MUCH MORE RELIGIOUS,
TRADITIONAL.
>> Jon: NO, WE DON'T HAVE THATSPLIT.
[LAUGHTER]GO AHEAD.
>> BUT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DOIS SHOW THE NUANCES AND THE
LAYERS, AS WELL.
THAT THERE AREN'T JUST THESE TWOPOLAR OPPOSITES.
ACTUALLY, THERE ARE ALL OF THESEREALLY COMPLEX LAYERS IN
BETWEEN.
IT'S REALLY GRAY.
>> Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT INTERMS OF HAVING TO LIE, IT'S
BECAUSE IF THEY ARE TO RUN AFOULOF THOSE MORE TRADITIONAL
REGULATIONS, THERE IS REALCONSEQUENCE TO THAT?
>> YES, THAT'S EXACTLY...
THERE'S A LOT MORE AT STAKE.
IF YOU ARE CAUGHT DRINKING, YOUMAY BE FLOGGED.
IF YOU KNOW, AND ALSO, YOU KNOW,SOCIAL STRUCTURES.
IT IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLEAMONG MANY IRANIANS TO HAVE SEX
BEFORE MARRIAGE...>> Jon: SURE.
>> TO NOT BE A VIRGIN BEFOREMARRIAGE, SO YEAH YOU
CAN GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THELAW...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YOU CAN BEJUDGED BY SOCIETY.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK ISMORE POWERFUL THERE?
IS IT THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS ORTHE SOCIETAL?
WHAT DO YOU THINK CARRIES MORESWAY IN THESE FAMILIES?
>> I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING INSOCIETY IS REALLY INTERESTING AT
THE MOMENT BECAUSE THERE IS ACHANGE. I THINK THERE'S A
SEXUAL AWAKENING GOING ON AMONGIRANIAN YOUTH, THAT, YOU
KNOW, TRANSCENDS CLASS,TRANSCENDS RELIGIOUS
BARRIERS AND RELIGIOUSDIFFERENCES AT THE MOMENT,
I HAVE SEEN IT REALLY TRICKLEDOWN. SO I THINK SOCIETY
IS SLOWLY CHANGING.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THE BIGGEST FEAR FORPEOPLE IS GETTING IN TROUBLE
WITH THE REGIME, GETTING INTROUBLE WITH THE LAW.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IT'S NOT, IT'SNOT SO MUCH, BECAUSE THERE ARE,
YOU KNOW, IFYOUR FAMILY IS VERY TRADITIONAL
BUT YOU FEEL LIKE THERE MIGHT BEMORE UNDERSTANDING THERE, BUT
THE LAW REALLY IS A MONOLITH ANDHAS NO FLEXIBILITY.
>> NO.
UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY.
SO I'VE MET PEOPLE WHO HAVEBOUGHT THEIR FLOGS.
SO YOU CAN PAY TO GET OUT OFGETTING FLOGGED.
>> Jon: YOU CAN PAY TO GET OUTOF GETTING FLOGGED?
>> YES, AND ALSO, YOUCAN ACTUALLY PAY SOMEONE
ELSE TO TAKE YOUR FLOG FOR YOU.
>> Jon: SO LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT.
>> SO OUTSIDE COURTHOUSES WHEREYOU GET FLOGGED, THERE ARE POOR
SOULS HANGING AROUND OFFERING TOBE FLOGGED INSTEAD OF YOU?
AND THEY ARE IN CAHOOTS WITH THEFLOGGER USUALLY.
SO THEY GO HALF-HALF ON THEMONEY.
>> Jon: THE FLOGEE AND THEFLOGGER...
>> YEAH.
>> Jon IF WHAT YOU'RETELLING ME IS TRUE...
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND I THINK WHATYOU'RE TELLING ME IS TRUE...
>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU'RE SAYING IN TEHRAN,IN IRAN, THERE IS A DIFFERENT
JUDICIAL SYSTEM FOR RICH PEOPLEAND POOR PEOPLE.
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.
[LAUGHTER][CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AS AN AMERICAN, AS AN AMERICAN,I MUST STAND UP AND SAY, HOW CAN
THEY ALLOW THIS?
>> WE ARE SO SIMILAR.>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT...
>> I KNOW.>> Jon: IT'S SO INTERESTING.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYINGTHAT THEY ARE ANALOGOUS AND
CERTAINLY FLOGGING, BUT IT SEEMSAS THOUGH THERE IS A CONTINUUM
WITHIN THESE GOVERNMENTS WHERE,YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS CLEAN.
YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENTS ANDPEOPLES ARE ALWAYS IN THIS
TITANIC STRUGGLE BETWEEN SORT OFTHE FREEDOMS AND THE AUTHORITY,
AND MAYBE IT'S JUST MORE STARKLYDELINEATED IN IRAN.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: I MEAN, THE STORIES AREBEAUTIFUL, AND THEY'RE SO WELL
DETAILED AND THEY'RE SO NUANCED,WHERE DOES IT GO?
YOU KNOW, IN AMERICA WE TRIEDBANNING ALCOHOL FOR 13 YEARS.
AND AFTER 13 YEARS WE WERE LIKE,I NEED A SHOT.
LIKE THEY COULDN'T... WHERE DOYOU SEE THE PRESSURE THEN COMING
FROM HERE?
IS IT A GENERATIONAL CHANGE THATOCCURS?
>> I THINK IT WILL BE AGENERATIONAL CHANGE.
I THINK SOCIALLY THINGS ARECHANGING.
I THINK CULTURALLY IT'S BACK ANDFORTH, BACK AND FORTH.
IT'S JUST A POWER PLAY REALLYBETWEEN THE HARDLINERS AND THE
REFORMISTS OR AT THE MOMENTPRESIDENT ROUHANI.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> CULTURALLY, YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL LOOSEN SOCIALSTURCTURES. THEY'RE VERY SMART,
AS WELL. SO THEY'LL KIND OFLIFT THE POT, THEY'LL LIFT THE
LID OFF THE BOILING POT. LET OFFA BIT OF STEAM, AND AGAIN
THEY'LL PULL BACK ON THE REINS.BUT I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING
WITH IRAN REGARDING CHANGE ISTHAT IRANIANS HAVE REALLY
CHANGED FROM FROM WHAT I'VE SEENIN THE LAST TEN YEARS HOW THEY
FEEL ABOUT CHANGE IN THEIRCOUNTRY AND THAT IS A DIRECT
RESULT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING INTHE COUNTRIES AROUND THEM.
THEY'VE SEEN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN.THEY'RE LOOKING AT SYRIA NOW.
TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS INIRAN, THEY WERE MUCH MORE
PRO BIG CHANGE.>> Jon: RIGHT, REVOLUTION.
>> SOME IRANIANS, YEAH,REVOLUTION, PROTESTS, SOME
IRANIANS WOULD EVEN TALK ABOUTWESTERN INTERVENTION.
NOW THEY'RE REALLY UNIFIED INTHE FACT THAT THEY ARE RESIGNED
TO ANY CHANGE, THE FACT THAT ANYCHANGE WILL BE SLOW AND THEY
FEEL THAT CHANGE SHOULD COMEFROM WITHIN.
THOSE REALLY FEAR A BLOOD BATH.
>> Jon: RIGH, WELL, CERTAINLY,YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY
THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCETO, YOU KNOW, TO BACK THAT UP.
IS THAT AN OPEN CONVERSATIONTHAT TAKES PLACE IN IRAN, OR IS
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S MORE OF ASTREET LEVEL CONVERSATION?
>> STREET-LEVEL CONVERSATION.>> Jon: I SEE.
>> YEAH.
SO YEAH, IN IRAN, THERE ARE...THIS IS ANOTHER, YOU KNOW, CITY
OF LIES. YOU HAVE YOURRED LINES, AND EVERYBODY
KNOWS WHAT THE RED LINE IS.AND THEY'RE MOVEABLE,
BUT YOU HAVETO KEEP WITHIN THE RED LINES, AS
A JOURNALIST AND AS AN ORDINARYCITIZEN.
AND ALSO YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, YOUHAVE TWO SELVES.
YOU HAVE YOUR PRIVATE SELF ANDYOUR PUBLIC SELF.
SO YOU'RE VERY DIFFERENT IN YOUOWN ROOM BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AS
YOU ARE IN PUBLIC.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY.
YOU'RE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
IT CAN BE QUITE A SCHIZOPHRENICSOCIETY.
>> Jon: WELL, THE ONLY ADVICEI WOULD GIVE TO IRAN IS, WITH
YOUR PRIVATE SELF, DON'T PUT ITON THE CLOUD BECAUSE...
[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]
"CITY OF LIES" ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
RAMITA NAVAI.
