>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THE GUEST TONIGHT, LISTEN TO THIS, SETTLE DOWN.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, THAT'S RIGHT, TODAY ON THE SHOW, SUPREME COURT... THANK YOU VERY
MUCH -- SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SONNIA SOTOMAYOR ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNLESS I BELIEVE SHE'S COMING
OUT HERE.
UNLESS THIS IS ANOTHER ELABORATE HOAX BY MANTI TE'O NEMESIS RONAIAH TUIASOSOPO OR AS THE
GERMANS REFER TO HIM (SPEAKING NONSENSE).
SOME OF YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO SEE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HERE, ONE, BECAUSE SHE IS A
SITTING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND TWO BECAUSE THIS AFTERNOON SHE WAS IN WASHINGTON
ADMINISTERING THE PUBLIC OATH OF OFFICE TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.
DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE BIDEN JUST WANTS TO HIGH-FIVE HER?
THAT IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST PART OF SWEARING IN BIDEN IS EXPLAINING TO HIM THAT YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY GET TO SWEAR.
"HEY, HEY, DON'T WORRY, SWEETHEART, I'LL HOLD THE
[BLEEP] CONSTITUTION.
I SWEAR.
COME ON.
GIVE ME ONE." JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR HAS BEEN VERY BUSY.
YESTERDAY AT 8:15 A.M. SHE DID THE OFFICIAL NON-PAGEANTRY VERSION OF THAT CEREMONY THE
VICE PRESIDENT
>> THE REASON WHY IT WAS SO EARLY IS THAT JUSTICE SEASONNIA SOTOMAYOR HAD TO GET ON TO A
TRAIN TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY TO SIGN A NEW BOOK.
SHE SAID SHE WAS TRYING TO GET TO BARNES AND NOBLE THIS AFTERNOON
>> Jon: NOW THAT'S FAIR.
BIDEN CAN GET INAUGURATED ANY TIME BUT IF THE JUSTICE WAITS TOO LONG, THERE MAY NOT BE A
BARNS AND NOBLE
