SOMEWHERE AROUND FOUR YEARS AGO OUR ECONOMY EXPERIENCED A CYCLICAL FISCAL PHENOMENON
KNOWN AS A CATASTROPHE
[BLEEP] WHEN OUR LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BEGAN TO COLLAPSE AFTER MAKING
INCREDIBLY RISKY BETS BASICALLY USING OUR PENSION MONEY TO GAMBLE ON THE VALUE OF OUR HOUSES.
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE BUSINESS IS JUST TAKING YOUR MONEY AND THEN LOANING IT
OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE AT SLIGHTLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES IS JUST TOO --
>> BANK AFTER BANK SWALLOWED IN THE AFTERMATH, LEHMAN AND BEAR STERN, DONE, MERRILL,
DEAD, SOLD FOR PARTS, WHAT MU AND GOLDMAN, YOU GET THE IDEA.

>> Jon: OKAY, THE $2 BILLION ISING LAING PRETTY GOOD NOW.
APOLOGIZE.
I WAS INCORRECT ABOUT THE 2.

YOU WERE THE BANKER.
>> YOU WERE THE ONE.
WHO DIDN'T MAKE THESE BIG,
RISKY BETS.
>> THE PORTFOLIO HAS PROVEN TO BE RISKIER, MORE VOLATILE AND LESS EFFECTIVE THAN
ECONOMIC HEDGE THAN WE THOUGHT.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE [BLEEP] I HAVE EVER HEARD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I DIDN'T MAKE A BET,
IT'S A HEDGE.
I DIDN'T GET WIPED OUT AND LOSE ALL MY MONEY, IT'S JUST THAT HARD WAY IS PROVEN A
MORE RISKY VOLATILE-- VOLATILE ECONOMIC HEDGE THAN I THOUGHT.
