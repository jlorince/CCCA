[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS ANINSTRUCTOR AT THE M.I.T. MEDIA
LAB AND IS THE CEO OF DITTOLABS.
HIS NEW BOOK "ENCHANTED OBJECTS.
DESIGN, HUMAN DESIRE, AND THEINTERNET OF THINGS ."
PLEASE WELCOME DAVID ROSE TO THESHOW.
SIR! NICE TO SEE YOU. COME ANDSIT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR JOINING US. THE BOOK ISCALLED "ENCHANTED OBJECTS."
NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEBOOK, YOU SAY ENCHANTED OBJECTS,
YOU SEE THE UMBRELLA.YOU THINK, ALRIGHT, WE'RE IN FOR
SOME MARY POPPINS TYPE SITUATIONHERE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "ENCHANTEDOBJECTS?"
>> WELL, I THINK ABOUT THECELLPHONE. AND THERE'S BEEN SO
MANY AMAZING THINGS YOU CAN DOWITH A CELLPHONE AND
WITH APPS. BUT THE PROBLEM IS,IT TOTALLY
MONOPOLIZES YOUR ATTENTION.LIKE, MOST OF US ARE STARING
INTO THIS MOST OF THE DAY.
>> Jon: YOU'RE SUGGESTINGTHAT THAT'S AN ISSUE?
>> WELL, I THINK THERE IS ANOPPORTUNITY TO TAKE, TO BECOME
UNGLUED FROM THIS SCREEN ANDSPREAD THE APPS INTO EVERY DAY
OBJECTS, INTO DESKS, INTOCLOTHING, INTO ROOMS,
INTO JEWELRY, JUST LIKE,EVERYWHERE. AND IT'S GOING TO
BE A MUCH NICER WAY TO INTERACTWITH TECHNOLOGY.
>> Jon: IT'S ALSO, IF YOU THINKABOUT IT, WILL THEN BE EASIER
FOR COMPUTERS TO BECOME SENTIENTAND TURN ON US AND KILL US.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: ARE YOU, ARE YOU
ANXIOUS, DO YOU NEED -- WHAT ISTHAT?
>> I HAVE JUST SUCH A DEVICE.
>> Jon: REALLY?>> YEAH.
>> Jon: HOW CONVENIENT.
>> I JUST, I WANTED TO SHOW YOUANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AN ENCHANTED
OBJECT FOR YOURHEALTH. NOW THIS IS A GLOW CAP.
AND IT ACTUALLY NOTIFIES YOUTHROUGH SUBTLE LIGHTS AND SOUND
TO TAKE AN IMPORTANT MEDICATIONAND IT WILL ALSO TEXT YOU SO
YOU DON'T FORGET. SO THIS ISANOTHER...
>> Jon: SO, THIS IS IN ESSENCEMY MOTHER IN A CAP FORM.
>> WELL --Jon: DOES IT EVER CRITICIZE
YOU IN ANY WAY?
>> I SHARE THE DATA OF MYMEDICATION TAKING WITH MY DAD.
AND HE DOES THE SAME WITH ME.
SO WE CAN BOTH SORT OF GIVE EACHOTHER [BEEP] EVERY WEEK.
>> Jon: IS THAT, NOW, BUT WHAT,WHAT HAPPENS NOW,
SO, THIS THING WILL BEEP WHENYOU'RE SUPPOSE TO TAKE IT?
>> WELL, IT TRIES TO BE ASSUBTLE AS POSSIBLE.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> SO, IT CLEARS ITS THROATFIRST. AND THEN...
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: LET ME JUST SAY LIKE,
HEY, HEY. HEY, YOURHEART'S GONNA STOP.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS,YOU KNOW, THAT IT WILL BRING,
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT, IGUESS, WOULD NORMALLY COME UP ON
YOUR PHONE.
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU'DREALLY USE A MEDICATION TAKING
APP. IF YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO DO THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LOG YOUR MEDS SCHEDULEIN YOUR PHONE.
>> Jon: SO, THIS IS SLIGHTLYEASIER BECAUSE...
>> WELL, IT'S SORT OF, IT'SEMBEDDED IN AN EVERY DAY
GESTURE. LIKE, YOU HAVE TO OPENTHE CAP TO GET THE MED OUT
ANYWAY, SO IF...>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> SO...>> Jon: SO TO JUST BE THERE...
>> RIGHT. SO, THAT'S THE PROMISEOF A ENCHANTED OBJECT IS TO...
>> Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING.>> ...TAKE THE EVERY DAY
OBJECTS, THE EVERY DAYGESTURES AND EMBED
FUNCTIONALITY IN THOSE THINGS.
>> Jon: IS THERE A CONCERNTHAT THEN WE THEN LOSE OUR
ABILITY TO BE FUNCTIONAL.
IF EVERYTHING -- IF AS SOON ASYOU WALK DOWN STAIRS THE MILK
GOES "HEY, WHAT ARE WE HAVINGCEREAL?" YOU KNOW, DO YOU,
DO YOU LOSE THEN -- HOW DO WEKEEP IT SO THAT IT ENHANCES
OUR LIVES WITHOUT US BEINGSUBSERVIENT TO THAT TECHNOLOGY.
>> WELL, I THINK WE ALL NEEDHELP IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW,
THESE DAILY ACTIVITIES. YOUKNOW, I HAVE A FIT BIT ON AND SO
DOES THE REST OF MY FAMILY SO WECAN SORT OF SHARE HOW MUCH SLEEP
YOU'RE GETTING, HOW MUCH YOU'REWALKING.
SO, IT'S SORT OF A WAY TO KEEPEVERY BODY HEALTHY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OFSENSING.
>> Jon: NOW CAN'T YOU SAYTHOUGH, BECAUSE I HAVE A FAMILY.
CAN'T YOU SAY TO THEM, I ONLYSLEPT SIX HOURS LAST NIGHT OR
JUST COME DOWN AND GO MMMMM.>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: DOES IT, WHERE DOES THEDATA GO?
>> WELL, THIS, THIS IS OPT IN.SO, IT GOES TO WHOEVER I
CHOOSE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALL,ALL...
>> Jon: TO THEIR WATCH ASWELL...
>> ALL OF FACEBOOK.
>> Jon: IT GOES TO FACEBOOK?
>> WELL, YOU CAN SHARE. IF, YOUKNOW,
IT'S YOUR CHOICE AS TO HOWBROADLY YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE
INFORMATION.
>> Jon: WHAT WILLTHEY DO? LIKE ONCE -- CAUSE
ONCE YOU PUT THIS OUT THERE ANDFACEBOOK FINDS OUT YOU TAKE
PILLS AND HAD SIX HOURS OF SLEEPTHEY WILL [BLEEP] HAUNT YOU.
YOU WILL SEE, THERE ARE THINGSTHAT ARE LISTED ONLY FOR YOU.
HOW DO YOU STOP ALL THIS DATAFROM BEING CO-OPTED?
>> WELL, I GOT A SCALE THATTWEETS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
[LAUGHING]>> AND, UH, THIS WAS SORT OF A
-- THIS WAS SORT OF A PROBLEM. IMEAN, I THOUGHT, YOU KNO,
I THOUGHT I WAS OPTIMISTIC ANDTHOUGHT MY WEIGHT COULD SORT OF
GO IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION.BUT, BUT MY SCALE WOULD TWEET
EVERY SATURDAY AUTOMATICALLY.
AND, THIS WAS ABOUT THE SAMETIME FOUR SQUARE WAS HAVING YOU
CHECK IN, YOU KNOW, TORESTAURANTS. AND IN MY CASE
IT WAS JUST THE SAME BAKERYEVERY SINGLE SATURDAY.
[LAUGHING]>> AND SO, LIKE I HAD A LOT OF
FRIENDS THAT REACHED OUT ANDTHEY WERE LIKE
MAYBE THERE IS A CORRELATIONBETWEEN YOUR WEIGHT GOING UP AND
THE BAKERY.
>> Jon: I LOVE IT. SO IT'S JUST,IN, IN ESSENCE IT'S
LIKE A FOCUS GROUPON YOUR LIFE TO BE ABLE TO
SAY TO YOU, WELL ITHINK I KNOW WHY YOU'RE GETTING
HEAVIER. BECAUSE YOU'RE...I'M WORRIED THAT YOU'RE
PULLING SOMETHING OUT OF YOURPOCKET NOW. WE'VE GOT TO GO.
>> NO WAIT, WAIT, I HAVESOMETHING ELSE. I HAVE... OH...
Jon: I'LL GO, WE'LL THROW.
WILL YOU STAY AND TALK ABOUTTHAT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THIS IS BLOWINGMY MIND.
OKAY.
"ENCHANTED OBJECTS" IT'S ON THEBOOK SHELVES NOW.

LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S IN YOURPOCKET.
