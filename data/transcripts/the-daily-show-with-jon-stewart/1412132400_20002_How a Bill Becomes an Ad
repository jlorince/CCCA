OATMEAL" LEVEL OF FOLKSINESS!THIS NEVER HAPPENS.
ALMOST HAPPENS. BRILLIANTLYDONE PEOPLE.
ONE OF YOU WILL TAKE THATDOWN-HOME, JUST-FOLKS,
REAL-AMERICAN-NESS TO WASHINGTONTO WRITE THE KIND OF
COMMON-SENSE, AW-SHUCKS LAWSTHAT SOMEHOW PROTECT THIS
NATION FROM TRESSPASSINGCHICKENS OR WHATEVER.
OR YOU WOULD DO THAT, IF MAKING
LAWS WAS STILL WHAT CONGRESSDID. ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.
ALL AMERICANS KNOW HOW A BILLBECOME A LAW.
>> ♪ I'M JUST A BILL ♪ YES, I'M ONLY A BILL
♪ AND I'M SITTING HERE ONCAPITOL HILL ♪♪
>> Jon: RECENTLY THE LEGISLATIVEPROCESS, THOUGH, HAS GROWN
MORE COMPLICATED. TAKE THE 2010DODD FRANK ACT.
IN THE WAKE OF THE 2008CATASTROPHIC BANK COLLAPSE THAT
DESTROYED THE WORLD'S ECONOMY,IT WAS MEANT TO URGENTLY REFORM
A CRIPPLED AND FAILINGFINANCIAL SYSTEM.
BUT AFTER SIXTEEN MONTHS OFHEARINGS, LOBBYING AND HORSE
TRADING CONGRESS FINALLYPRODUCED AN 848-PAGE WATERED
DOWN TOOTHLESS PIECEOF (BLEEP) THAT LEAVES
OUR ECONOMY ALMOST AS VULNERABLEAS IT WAS PRE-CRISIS
OR AS CONGRESS NOW CALLS THAT,THEIR FINEST HOUR.
>> THE CURRENT CONGRESS IS BADAT PASSING LEGISLATION.
>> THEIR RECORD IS JUST DISMAL.
>> IT'S ON TRACK TO BE THE LEASTPRODUCTIVE IN HISTORY.
>> Jon: IN OTHER WORDS,CONGRESS HAS NOW GREATLY
SIMPLIFIED THE PROCESS FORPASSING LAWS,
IN THAT IT DOES NOT.BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS USELESSWHICH BRINGS US TO OUR
NEW SEGMENT, HOW A BILL BECOMESAN AD.
HERE'S HOW THE LEGISLATIVEPROCESS WORKS NOW.
>> WE HAVE A WHOLE AGENDA NOWCALLED THE FAIR SHOT AGENDA --
EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, EQUAL WORK.>> RIGHT.
>> MINIMUM WAGE, HELPINGPAY FOR COLLEGE.
>> Jon: NOBLE GOALS! BUTDEMOCRATS LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER
ARE OR COURSE AWARE THATTHERE IS NO POSSIBILITY
FOR ANY OF THOSE TOBE PASSED!
WHY DO AT A CONTINUE TO PURSUETHEM?
>> NOW, WE DEMOCRATS WOULDPREFER THESE ITEMS PASS AND
BECOME LAW.
BUT IF REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TOOPPOSE THESE ISSUES, THEY'LL DO
SO AT THEIR OWN POLITICAL RISK.
THAT'S THE DISTINCTION WE WILLDRAW IN NOVEMBER.
>> Jon: FOR ONCE A YEAR --
-- IT IS WRITTEN THAT IN OUR11th MONTH, WE GATHER AS A
CONGREGATION TO DRAW ADISTINCTION BETWEEN, AS
MAIMONIDES PUT IT, FECKLESSNESSAND OBSTRUCTIONISM.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING --THAT --
(LAUGHTER)LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING -- NO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(BLEEP) KILLED AT MYBAR MITZVAH. KILLED!
SCHUMER JUST LAUNCHED THE FAIRSHOT AGENDA
LIKE A CLAY PIGEON FORREPUBLICANS TO
SHOOT DOWN, SO THAT DEMOCRATSCOULD THEN RUN MIDTERM CAMPAIGN
ADS LIKE THESE.
>> HEY, MITCH, WHY DO YOUREFUSE TO GIVE STUDENTS THE SAME
LOAN RATES AS THOSE BIG BANKS
>> WHILE VOTING 17 TIMES AGAINSTRAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.
>> WILL YOU FINALLY GIVE WOMENEQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK?
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: OH...
HATERS, GONNA HATE, HATE --WELL, I'M JUST GONNA SHAKE IT
OFF...
A'YUP.
GOOD WORK, SENATE DEMOCRATS!
YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO TURNPERPETUAL GRIDLOCK INTO
PERPETUAL GRIDLOCK-ADE.
OF COURSE, REPUBLICANS DO THESAME THING IN THE CHAMBER THEY
CONTROL.
YOU EVER WONDER WHY THE HOUSEWASTED EVERYONE'S TIME ON 54
FAILED VOTES TO REPEAL ALL ORPART OF OBAMACARE?
HERE'S WHY.
>> BARBER HAS FALLEN IN LINEWITH OBAMA AND PELOSI, EVEN
VOTING TO DEFEND OBAMACARE.
>> CONGRESSMAN AMI BERA VOTED TOKEEP IT.
>> SCHNEIDER VOTED TOKEEP OBAMACARE.
>> BARROW VOTED TO KEEPOBAMACARE NOT ONCE
BUT THREE TIMES!
>> OF COURSE, HE WANTSOBAMACARE!
LOOK AT HIS FREAKISHLYDISFIGURED BODY!
CREEPY GIANT HEAD AND HISFREAKISH FINGERS!
BEFORE OBAMACARE THAT'DBE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY SAYINGTO YOURSELF, I CANNOT BELIEVE
HOW CHILDISH AND CYNICAL OURCONGRESS HAS BECOME.
WELL DON'T THROW UP YET.
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS AREHELPING DEMOCRATS MOVE
LEGISLATION ON EQUAL PAY ANDCAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.
>> Jon: WHAT!
OH, MY GOSH, I WOULD SAY HOORAYFOR THAT IF I DIDN'T KNOW IN MY
HEART THAT THERE MUST BE SOMECRAVEN RUSE THAT WOULD
BONERIZE MACHIAVELLI AT PLAYHERE.
>> AWAY FROM THE MICROPHONESENATE REPUBLICANS ACKNOWLEDGE
THEY ARE CHEWING UP TIME ON THESENATE FLOOR TO AVOID
TOUGH VOTES. BY EXTENDING DEBATEON THESE TWO ISSUES THEY ARE
OCCUPYING THE REMAINING FEW DAYSON THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR.
AND THAT'S PREVENTING DEMOCRATSLED BY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
HARRY REID TO SCHEDULEA POLITICALLY VOLATILE
VOTES BEFORE THE FALL RECESS.
>> Jon: WELL COME TO YOUR NEWCONGRESS, PEOPLE.
YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING?
SO THEY SAY, I SEE YOUR ATTACKAD BAIT AND I RAISE YOU
TIME-KILLING, FALSE COOPERATION.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE ONA BAD DATE.
DEMOCRATS KNOW THE REPUBLICANSDON'T WANT TO BE THERE, AND
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THEDEMOCRATS KNOW THE REPUBLICANS
DON'T WANT TO BE THERE.
(LAUGHTER)SO IN THEIR CYNICISM, THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE ASKED -- WANNASEE THE DESSERT MENU?
AND OUT OF SPITE, THEREPUBLICANS HAVE SAID, BRING
OVER THE WHOLE (BLEEP) CART.
(LAUGHTER)AND THE ESPRESSO MACHINE,
BECAUSE I CAN DO THIS ALL NIGHTLONG!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SEX, BUTI'M GONNA MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
GET TO (BLEEP) ANYBODY ELSEEITHER.
SO PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO UPDATETHE CLASSIC
HOW A BILL BECOMES A LAW.
♪ I'M JUST A BILL ♪ AND IT'S MAKING ME ILL
♪ NOW I WON'T EVEN BE A CAMPAIGN♪  SO I'M JUST HOLDING MY DICK
♪  AS I SIT HERE AND WAIT ♪
♪ WHILE THE BAD MOTHER (BLEEP)HOLD A PHONY DEBATE ♪
♪ I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
♪ I'M DONE ♪ I'LL BUY A GUN
♪ AND MY BRAINS I WILL SPILL ONSTEPS OF THE CAPITOL HILL ♪♪
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, SOMEBODYGET A BROOM!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
