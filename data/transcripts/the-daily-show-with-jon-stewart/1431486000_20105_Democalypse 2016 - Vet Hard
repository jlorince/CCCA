ROUNDS, IT'S THE SUBJECT OFTONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2016:
RELEASE THE VETTING!
FIRST UP, FORMER ARKANSASGOVERNOR, MIKE HUCKABEE.
>> AN INFOMERCIAL YOU MADE FOR ADIABETES CURE IS SIMPLY NOT
SUPPORTED BY THE MEDICALCOMMUNITY.
>> Jon: SCHIEFFER ISREFERING TO AN INFOMERCIAL
HUCKABEE DID TOUTING A DIABETESREVERSAL KIT FEATURING DIET
CHANGES AND THE AFOREMENTIONEDQUESTIONABLE PILLS
MADE OF CINNAMON AND CHROMIUMPICOLINATE.
WE ALL OF COURSE REMEMBER THATINGREDIENT MADE FAMOUS
BY THE CHROMIUM PICOLINATECHALLENGE ON YOUTUBE.
EVERYBODY --
MIKE HUCKABEE, HOW DO YOU PLEAD?
>> IF THAT'S THE WORST THINGTHAT SOMEBODY CAN SAY TO ME,
THAT I ADVOCATED FOR PEOPLE WHOHAVE DIABETES TO DO
SOMETHING TO REVERSE IT AND STOPTHE INCREDIBLE PAIN OF THAT,
THEN I'M GOING TO BE A HECK OF AGOOD PRESIDENT.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, THE
UNREALISM OF THAT STATEMENTAT THE END THERE...
BASICALLY HE'S SAYING, IF THEWORST THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT ME
IS I LEVERAGED MY REPUTATIONAS ELECTED OFFICIAL TO SELL A
SPECIOUS CURE TO ENRICH MYSELFFROM THOSE SUFFERING WITH
A DEBILITATING DISEASE, THEN-- YEAH, IT'S [BLEEP] BAD.
I GUESS THAT'S BAD.
BUT HUCKABEE ISN'T THE ONLYCANDIDATE ANSWERING FOR
PAST ERRORS IN EITHER JUDGMENTOR STATEMENT.
>> YOU HAVE COMPARED OURGOVERNMENT TODAY TO NAZI
GERMANY.
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?
HERE IS WHAT YOU SAIDABOUT ObamaCare.
THE WORST THING SINCE SLAVERY?
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, UNLESSBEN CARSON'S IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
IS, YEAH, YOU KNOW, YOU'RERIGHT, I'M NOT QUALIFIED IN ANY
WAY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENCY,
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO HEARANYTHING MORE FROM HIM.
ALL RIGHT, BY THE WAY, THECANDIDATES --
(LAUGHTER)SERIOUSLY, SLAVERY, NAZI
GERMANY, BYE BYE.
THE CANDIDATES AREN'T THE ONLYONES BEING VETTED.
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT WHICHMEMBER OF THIS INTERVIEW
ALSO DESERVES TO GET PRIMARIEDOUT OF 2016.
>> IT SEEMS TO ME, YOUR LASTNAME IS CRUZ AND YOU'RE FROM
TEXAS. JUST BASED ON THAT,SHOULD YOU HAVE APPEAL TO
HISPANIC VOTERS?
I WANT TO CLOSE AND TALKA LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
YOUR CUBAN HERITAGE. DO YOUGOT A FAVORITE CUBAN FOOD?
DO YOU LIKE CUBAN MUSIC? DO YOUHAVE A FAVORITE CUBAN SINGER?
>> Jon: SENATOR CRUZ! I'DLIKE YOU TO FINISH THIS
SENTENCE FOR ME IF YOU WOULD:UPSIDE, INSIDE OUT, SHE'S
LIVING LA VIDA -- BLANK --LA VIDA -- BLANK.
SENATOR ARE YOU EVENHISPANIC, SENATOR ?
FAKE CUBAN SAYS WHAT?
SENATOR?
(LAUGHTER)ANYWAY, THE INTERVIEW WAS PRETTY
HORRIBLE AND IT GOT MAS WORSE.
>> FINALLY I WANT TO GIVE YOUTHE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY
WELCOME YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATORSANDERS TO THE RACE AND I WOULD
LIKE YOU TO DO IT IFYOU WOULD EN ESPAÃ‘OL.
>> Jon: OR, SENATOR, IF YOUPREFER TO DANCE THE GREETING AS
I'M TOLD YOUR PEOPLEENJOY, I WILL ALLOW YOU
TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.
(LATIN MUSIC)DON'T BE SHY, SENATOR !
THIS IS YOUR CULTURE,SENATOR! COME ON, BABY!
DANCE FOR ME, SENATOR !
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
WHAT SONG IS THIS?
DO YOU KNOW?
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE!
(LAUGHTER)I'M NOT VERY MUSICAL.
NOW, RIGHT NOW THE TWOFRONTRUNNERS BOTH REPRESENT
DYNASTIC FAMILIES.
THE RACE COULD COME DOWN TO HOWEACH CANDIDATE HANDLES THEIR
PERSPECTIVE RELATIONSHIP TOTHEIR FAMILY'S LEGACY.
AND ACTUALLY IT COULD COME DOWNTO ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
IT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS AWAY. ITCOULD COME DOWN TO ANYTHING.
FIRST UP, HILLARY CLINTON.
>> CLINTON CALLED FOR AN END TOTHE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION,
BUT THAT IS A REJECTION OF TOUGHMEASURES SIGNED INTO LAW BY BILL
CLINTON IN 1994 WITH HILLARYCLINTON LOOKING ON.
HE BACKED A FEDEARL LAWTHAT DEFINED MARRIAGE AS
BEING BETWEEN A MAN AND WOMAN.
>> HER HUSBAND'S 1996IMMIGRATION BILL THAT BASICALLY
PUSHED MORE ARRESTS OFIMMIGRANTS.
>> HE PRESIDED OVER THEDEREGULATION.
>> HILLARY CLINTON HASIINCREASINGLY BEEN TAKING BANKS
AND BIG BUSINESS TO TASK --
>> Jon: IT'S LIKE SHE'S RUNNINGAGAINST BILL'S RECORD,
I MEAN, TROUBLE INPARADISE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
AND BY PARADISE I MEAN APOLITICALLY SYMBIOTIC
PARTNERSHIP BASED ON MUTUALAMBITION FOR GLOBAL DOMINATION.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT'S JEB'S ANGLE?
>> AFTER WEEKS OF PUBLICLYTRYING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF
SOMEWHAT FROM HIS BROTHER, WE'RETOLD IN A REPUBLICAN EVENT THE
OTHER DAY HE CITED GEORGE W.
BUSH AS ONE OF HIS TOP FOREIGNPOLICY ADVISORS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Jon: ONE OF HIS TOP FOREIGN
POLICY ADVISORS -- FOR HIM TOPOOP ON?
(LAUGHTER)THERE'S GOT TO BE A FINAL CLAUSE
IN THAT SENTENCE, RIGHT?
BECAUSE I THINK AT THIS POINTMOST OF AMERICA AGREES THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGNPOLICY, GEORGE W. BUSH IS
AN EXCELLENT PAINTER.
>> ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAQ -->> YEP.
>> OBVIOUSLY VERY CONTROVERSIAL,
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW WOULDYOU HAVE AUTHORIZED THE
INVASION?
>> I WOULD HAVE, AND SO WOULDHAVE HILLARY CLINTON, JUST TO
REMIND EVERYBODY AND SO WOULDHAVE ALMOST EVERYBODY THAT WAS
CONFRONTED WITH THEINTELLIGENCE THEY GOT.
>> Jon: WHEN AN IRAQ WARQUESTION STARTS WITH A STATEMENT
"KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW," HELLYES, I'D STILL DO IT IS NOT AN
ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE.
SURE I'D GET ON THE TITANICAGAIN.
I MEAN, AT THE TIME IT HAD ATERRIFIC BUFFET.
WAS JEB BUSH ACTUALLY CHOOSINGTO ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH
ALL OF HIS BROTHER'S BAGGAGE?
>> I EMAILED HIM THIS MORNING, ISAID I'M GENUINELY WONDERING
DID YOU GENERALLY MISHEARTHE QUESTION?
AND HE SAID YES, I MISHEARD THEQUESTION.
>> JEB BUSH'S STAFFERS ARETRYING TO CAST THIS AS JEB WAS
ONLY TALKING ABOUT ISRAEL.
>> SO MENTIONING HIS BROTHER'SNAME IN THAT REGARD IS A GOOD
THING. LONG TERM, I'M NOT SOSURE.
>> Jon: YEAH, NO, I THINK THAT'SPROBABLY CORRECT.
LONG TERM MENTIONINGHIS BROTHER'S NAME IS LIKE
WEARING A (BLEEP) DOGS T-SHIRTDURING YOUR CAMPAIGN.
YOU MIGHT BE APPEALING TO ASMALL FRINGE OF DEAD-ENDERS BUT
MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT ANOTHERDOG (BLEEP) FOR PRESIDENT.
>> SLANDER!
>> Jon: PRESIDENT WARREN G.HARDING?
>> HOW DARE YOU SULLY THE MEMORYOF MY FAITHFUL DOG LADDIE BOY
WITH SUCH VULGARITY! I NEVER[BLEEP] MY DOG!
>> Jon: I WASN'T REFERRINGTO YOU, PRESIDENT HARDING,
IT WAS JUST A JOKE ANYWAY.
>> LET ME FINISH!
I NEVER (BLEEP) MY DOG!
WE MADE LOVE!
IT WAS MORE THAN JUST PHYSICALPASSION!
IT WAS A MOMENT OF TRUECONNECTION!
WE TOUCHED SOULS.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND NOW YOU'VERUINED IT!
(CRYING)(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IF THAT IS NOT PART OFTHE WARREN G. HARDING WIKIPEDIA
ENTRY BY TOMORROW MORNING, IWILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN ALL
OF YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
