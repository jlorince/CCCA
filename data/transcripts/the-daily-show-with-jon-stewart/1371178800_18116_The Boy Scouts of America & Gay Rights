>> John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW."
I'M JOHN OLIVER.
JON STEWART IS OFF FOR THE
SUMMER PERFORMING A DAVID
BLAINE-LIKE STUNT WHERE HE
SPENDS 90 STRAIGHT DAYS NOT
HOSTING A TALK SHOW.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FAREED
ZAKARIA.
THIS IS--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES.
THIS IS ACTUALLY HIS 17th
TIME ON THE SHOW, SO HE
LITERALLY HAS MORE EXPERIENCE
WITH INTERVIEW SEGMENTS ON THIS
SHOW THAN I DO.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT FIRST, IT SEEMS LIKE A
SUPREME COURT DECISION ON GAY
MARRIAGE WILL COME DOWN SOME
TIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.
THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOME
SEISMIC CHANGES RECENTLY IN OUR
NATION'S SOLE LANDSCAPE.
>> AFTER MONTHS OF CONSIDERATION
ABOUT INITIATIVES AS DIVIDED ITS
RANKS, DURING A PASSIONATE
DEBATE, TONIGHT THE BOY SCOUTS
OF AMERICA HAS VOTED TO ALLOW
OPENLY GAY MEMBERS.
>> John: YES!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES!
YES!
YES!
NOW, THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS FOR
GAY BOY SCOUTS, BUT--
( LAUGHTER )
A TRAGIC END FOR THE MERIT BADGE
FOR CLOSET STAINING.
EASY TO EARN THAT BADGE.
DIFFICULT TO KEEP.
BUT THIS PROGRESS IS ACTUALLY
NOT QUITE WHAT IT SEEMS.
>> THIS MEANS THE LONG-STANDING
POLICY WILL BE LIFTED THAT HAD
BANNED GAY SCOUTS, BUT IT
REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR BANNING
GAY SCOUT LEADERS.
>> John: OH, SO, THEY'RE HAPPY
TO WELCOME ANYONE WITH
HOMOSEXUAL THOUGHTS, UP UNTIL
THE AGE WHEN THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO ACT ON THEM.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT MUST CREATE AN AWKWARD
SITUATION AT BOY SCOUT
GRADUATIONS.
( LAUGHTER )
CONGRATULATIONS, SCOUT.
GAY SCOUTS LIKE YOU MAKE US ALL
PROUD.
OH, I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK AS A
LEADER ONE DAY.
YOU BURN IN HELL, PERVERT!
YOU BURN IN HELL!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I GUESS THIS IS PROGRESS OF A
SORT HOWEVER FRACTIONAL OR LONG
OVERDUE.
AND YET IT'S STILL ENOUGH TO
UPSET SOME PEOPLE.
>> TO RIP APART AN ORGANIZATION
THAT HAS DONE SO MUCH GOOD FOR
YOUNG PEOPLE, THE BOY SCOUTS, TO
SEE THAT TORN UP IN ORDER TO
ACCOMMODATE A FEW KIDS THAT, YOU
KNOW, WANT TO DO SEX WITH EACH
OTHER.
( LAUGHTER )
>> John: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.
DO SEX?
THAT PHRASE IS JUST THE LATEST
REASON THEY FEEL INCREDIBLY
SORRY FOR MRS.  PAT ROBERTSON.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO SEX
TONIGHT, DARLING?
WELL, NO, SWEETHEART, BUT IT
WOULD BE NICE IF YOU WOULD TEAR
