ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SO EVEN TEAM ROMNEY KNOWS NOT EVERY INVESTMENT PAYS OFF.
WHICH IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT'S INVESTMENT BATTING AVERAGE ISN'T THEIR REAL CONCERN.
>> EVEN IF WASHINGTON COULD BE GOOD AT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS, WHICH THEY'RE NOT, THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN
THE BUSINESS OF PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS.
THAT'S NOT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT.
>> IT'S NOT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT-- THIS IS THE ISSUE.
IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL ONE ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT.
THE PITHY ESSENCE OF THE CENTER OF THE CORE OF THE LIFE LIKE DOLL.
SO WHERE SHOULD WE BE PUTTING GOVERNMENT MONEY?
>> THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE DEVOTING OUR FEDERAL DOLLARS, PUTTING MONEY INTO TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE AND RESEARCH.
>> AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR PELL GRANT PROGRAM GROWING.
>> I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE.
>> HAVING GOOD ROADS AND BRIDGES AND RAIL LINES AND SO FORTH AND AIR TRAFFIC LINES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A
STRONG ECONOMY.
>> Jon: THAT'S PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS!
INVESTING IN ROADS, RAIL AND AIRCRAFT AND SAYING YES, TO CARS, TRAINS AND PLANES BUT
[BLEEP] BUY CYCLES.
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD DECISION BUT IT'S STILL PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS DONE
THAT WANT TO BUILD A HIGHWAY?
WHICH WINNER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY SHOULD BUILD IT?
WHICH LOSER TOWN SHOULD IT BYPASS.
(LAUGHTER) AGAIN, MAYBE A GOOD CHOICE, BUT IT'S A CHOICE.
EVERY DECISION GOVERNMENT MAKES PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS.
OR MAYBE MITT ROMNEY AND PAUL RYAN DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE PICKED LOSERS AND WINNERS IN WORLD WAR II.
BUT UNLIKE THEM, I'M GLAD WE BEAT HITLER.
(LAUGHTER) THAT IS THE WORST POSSIBLE PLACE YOU COULD TAKE THAT.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THIS IS SO OBVIOUS.
I'M STARTING TO THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE.
WHAT IS ROMNEY AND RYAN'S REAL PROBLEM.
>> THE PRESIDENT WOULD SPEND $90 BILLION ON SO-CALLED GREEN ENERGY JOBS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS BASED ON CONNECTIONS, BASED ON FADS LIKE SOLYNDRA.
>> WE ALL LIKE WIND AND SOLAR BUT YOU CAN'T DRIVE A CAR WITH A WINDMILL ON IT.
>> THE PAST PROSPERITY IS NOT THROUGH SOLAR SHINGLES AND HIGH SPEED TRAIN.
AND BY THE WAY, I LIKE COAL.
>> Jon: I LIKE IT A LOT!
I GIVE IT TO MY GRANDKIDS EVERY CHRISTMAS!
(LAUGHTER) SO THEY'RE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS.
SO HERE IS WHAT IT IS, THE REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO HAVE A PRINCIPLESED STANCE THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T PICK
WINNERS AND LOSERS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS RUN BY DEMOCRATS.
BUT WHEN IT'S RUN BY THEM,
