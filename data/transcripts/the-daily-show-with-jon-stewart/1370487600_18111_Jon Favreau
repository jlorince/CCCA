[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT.
NOT THE DIRECTOR OF IRONMAN, THE
FORMER DIRECTOR OF SPEECHWRITING
FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
HE IS THE COFOUNDER OF FENWAY
STRATEGY AND A COLUMNIST FOR THE
DAILY BEAST.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
JON FAVREAU.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M WELL.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: HOW WAS YOUR NEW CAREER?
YOU'VE LEFT THE SPEECHWRITING.
>> LEFT THE SPEECHWRITING.
I HAVE A LIFE AGAIN.
>> Jon: HOW LONG DID YOU SPEECH
WRITE?
>> I SPEECH-WROTE FOR...
Jon: DON'T.
I SEE YOUR TALENT ALREADY, SIR.
>> I WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT
SINCE 2005 WHEN HE GOT TO THE
SENATE.
>> Jon: BUT YOU SEEM VERY YOUNG
TO ME.
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST
BEGAN TO WRITE FOR HIM?
>> 23 OR 24.
I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW.
>> Jon: [BLEEP] YOU.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
WOW.
THAT'S TRULY REMARKABLE, NOT
THAT I WAS DOING WILD TURKEY IN
THE BASEMENT OF A LIQUOR STORE
ON ROUTE 1 IN JERSEY.
HOW DID THEY FIND YOU OR HOW DID
YOU FIND THEM?
>> I WAS IN THE KERRY CAMPAIGN I
WAS ROBERT GIBBS' ASSISTANT.
GIBBS LEFT TO GO WORK FOR OBAMA.
OBVIOUSLY THE KERRY CAMPAIGN
DIDN'T GO SO WELL.
>> Jon: WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?
AND THEN GIBBS CALLED ME WHEN
OBAMA WON AND SAID HE NEEDED A
SPEECH WRITER.
HE NEVER WORKED WITH ONE BEFORE.
HE WROTE THE 2004 CONVENTION
SPEECH HIMSELF.
BUT NOW, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 48
HOURS IN THE DAY.
HE WOULDN'T BE A SPEECH WRITER.
>> Jon: ARE YOU THE YES WE CAN
GUY.
>> YES WE CAN WAS FROM THE 2004
CAMPAIGN.
THAT WAS NOT ME.
BUT REVISED IT FOR THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY.
>> Jon: GOOD WORK.
SO NOW ARE YOU STILL, YOU KNOW,
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WHITE
HOUSE A LITTLE BIT UNDER SIEGE
RIGHT NOW?
DO THEY COME TO YOU AND GO, HEY,
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING,
MAYBE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO YOU
COULD THROW US?
WORK OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.
>> THEY DO NOT.
I MEAN, I WAS WITH HIM LONG
ENOUGH TO KNOW AND TO SEE A LOT
OF THESE, YOU KNOW, CRISES
BEFORE.
I REMEMBER THE OIL SPILL AND
HEALTH CARE AND, YOU KNOW, THE
DEBT LIMIT CRISIS AND THE FISCAL
CLIFF.
SO YOU GO THROUGH THESE
EXPERIENCES AND YOU REALIZE THAT
IN THE MOMENT IT SEEMS LIKE, OH,
GOD, THIS IS THE END OF THE
WORLD.
BUT THE PRESIDENT CAME INTO
OFFICE AND THE ECONOMY MIGHT GO
INTO DEPRESSION AND YOU'RE
FACING TWO WARS.
SO, YOU KNOW, HE HANDLED THAT.
HE CAN HANDLE THESE.
>> Jon: THE SENSE THAT YOU GUYS
HAD IS, IT COULD BE WORSE.
>> A THEME FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION.
>> Jon: THE DIFFICULTY FOR ME IS
IT SEEMS LIKE THE FUNDAMENTAL
FOUNDATION FOR HIS PRESIDENCY
WAS GOVERNMENT CAN BE AN
EFFECTIVE HELP FOR CATALYST IN
CREATING CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE
CAN MAKE THEIR OWN WAY.
THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO
NECESSARILY LIVE UP TO, TO SOME
EXTENT.
>> I THINK THE REASONS WHY...
THE REASON WHY THINGS LIKE THE
I.R.S. SCANDAL GETS THE
PRESIDENT STILL ANGRY IS BECAUSE
HE DOES HAVE A VISION OF
GOVERNMENT THAT CAN BE HELPFUL.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HIM
MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FACTS
COME OUT.
>> Jon: SURE.
PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
Jon: THEY SHOULD BE.
IT MAY NOT HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND IT
SEEMS NOT TO BUT IT IS SOMETHING
TO LOOK INTO IT.
THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL AGENCY
AND IT SEEMS EVEN THEY'VE
APOLOGIZED.
>> PARTICULARLY I THINK ON THE
OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT, YOU
KNOW, STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA
IT'S ALREADY WORKING LIKE IT'S
SUPPOSED TO.
THAT'S GOING TO HELP A LOT OF
PEOPLE.
THINGS AREN'T PERFECT.
RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
HIS VISION WAS NOT OF A
GOVERNMENT THAT CAN LIKE MAKE
EVERYONE...
>> Jon: FOR SURE.
I CAN PASS SOME LEGISLATION
AND SOME DECISIONS THAT MAKE
PEOPLE'S LIVES A LITTLE BETTER.
>> Jon: I LOOK AT THE V.A. THING
OF AN EXAMPLE THAT WORRIES ME.
HE COMES IN AND ONE OF THE FIRST
THING HE SAYS IS WE HAVE A
BROKEN V.A. SYSTEM.
THE BUREAUCRACY IS TERRIBLE.
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
POLITICALLY NOBODY HAS A PROBLEM
WITH.
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THE
DATABASES TO LINE UP AND EASE
THE BURDEN ON VETERANS.
FIVE YEARS LATER THE BACKLOG IS
MUCH HIGHER AND THEY STILL
HAVEN'T REALLY DONE IT.
THAT'S THE TYPE OF ISSUE THAT I
THINK... THAT'S NOT REPUBLICAN
OBSTRUCTIONISM.
THAT'S NOT ANYTHING BUT WE JUST
DIDN'T GET IT DONE.
IS THAT TROUBLING TO YOU AS A
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
HARPING ON THIS SINCE WE GOT
THERE.
HE ALWAYS WANTS TO DO MORE TO
MODERNIZE THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT, TO REORGANIZATION
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
I THINK THE ONE THING EVERYONE
REALIZES WHEN WE GOT THERE IS
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO
SHAPE A FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE AND
CHANGE THINGS OUT.
A LOT OF THESE AGENCIES JUST ARE
SET IN THEIR WAYS.
IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET IN THERE
AND CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE ACT.
>> Jon: ESPECIALLY GIVEN LIKE IN
TERMS OF MODERNIZING SOMETHING,
THAT'S THE EXPERTISE OF THE
CAMPAIGN.
THAT THEY WERE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THEY REVOLUTIONIZED MODERN
CAMPAIGNING BY USING THIS
TECHNOLOGY.
COULDN'T BY EXECUTIVE ORDER HE
COULD SAY $50 MILLION AND ALL MY
BEST TECH GUYS.
>> HE ASKED FOR THE AUTHORITY TO
REORGANIZE THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT WHICH YOU NEED TO
GET.
CONGRESS HAS TO PASS THAT
AUTHORITY.
BECAUSE EVERY COMMITTEE IN
CONGRESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
DIFFERENT AGENCIES.
>> Jon: YOU WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED
TO SAY...
>> THERE'S A LOT OF SEPARATE
TECHNOLOGY WHERE THERE'S MEDICAL
RECORDS ONLINE IN THE V.A. AND
PEOPLE CAN APPLY FOR SOCIAL
SECURITY BENEFITS ONLINE NOW.
YOU COULDN'T BEFORE.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HE'S
DONE WITH TECHNOLOGY.
I THINK HE WANTS TO DO MORE.
THEY WILL.
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK HE WOULD
LOOK AT THAT AS A REAL FAILURE,
A DISAPPOINTMENT OR WHY IS
SPHEURT BEING SUCH A DICK ABOUT
THIS?
>> NO, I THINK IF YOU ASKED HIM,
HE'D SAY WE HAVE TO WORK ON THAT
AND KEEP GOING.
WE HAVE TO KEEP AT IT.
I BET AFTER THE I.R.S. SCANDAL,
THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE REAL
PUSHES THAT HE MAKES IS TO KEEP
HAMMERING ON SOME OF THIS.
>> Jon: WERE YOU ABLE TO
MAINTAIN YOUR IDEALISM?
BECAUSE IT IS A TERRIBLE PLACE
WASHINGTON.
>> IT IS A TERRIBLE PLACE.
I THINK I MAINTAINED MY IDEALISM
BECAUSE I GOT TO WORK WITH THE
PRESIDENT EVERY DAY.
LOOKING BACK AND TAKING THE LONG
VIEW LIKE HE DOES, RIGHT,
EVERYONE ELSE IN WASHINGTON
FREAKS OUT ON SHORT-TERM THING.
HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE LONG
GAME.
>> Jon: HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING
HERE?
>> EIGHT YEARS SNOB ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT THE YEAR 3000?
>> NO, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOW
WE'RE LOOKING BACK AND THE
ECONOMY IS DOING A LOT BETTER,
RIGHT?
>> Jon: (MUMBLING).
IT'S GETTING THERE, RIGHT?
ONE OF HIS LEGACIES WILL BE
OBAMA CARE AND MAKING SURE THAT
IS IMPLEMENTEDDED PROPERLY.
I THINK THAT HE'S LESS WORRIED
ABOUT THE CRISIS OF THE MOMENT
THAN WHAT HAPPENS AFTER...
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
NOW THAT YOU'RE 24?
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD LUCK IN YOUR NEW CAREER.
YOU'RE HEADING OFF TO WRITE SOME
SCRIPTS AND DO SOME THINGS.
TERRIFIC.
HELP THE WORLD AND THEN HELP
RUIN IT.
