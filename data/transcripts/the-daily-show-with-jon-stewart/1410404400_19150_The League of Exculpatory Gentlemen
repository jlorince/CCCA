(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: MY NAME IS JON
STEWART AND WE HAVE A GOODPROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THESECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE
UNITED NATIONS BAN KI-MOONIS GOING TO BE JOINING US
HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE, YOUKNOW, I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHY HE'S GOING TO BE HERE.
(LAUGHTER)I'M EXCITED, I'M EXCITED,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY.
BUT FIRST, YOU MAY REMEMBEREARLIER THIS YEAR, THE WHAT DO
YOU CALL IT THERE BALTIMORERAVENS RAY RICE FOUND HIMSELF
IN A BIT OF HOT WATER WHEN ANATLANTIC CITY CASINO SECURITY
CAMERA CAUGHT HIM DRAGGING HISFIANCEE'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY OUT
OF AN ELEVATOR AFTER HE HADASSAULTED HER BECAUSE A
GENTLEMAN WOULD NEVER LEAVE HISFIANCEE'S
UNCONSCIOUS BODYUNATTENDED IN AN ELEVATOR, I
MEAN -- IT WAS THE SORT OFDISPECTABLE ACT OUR SOCIETY
WOULD NOT TOLERATE.
AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HADNO CHOICE BUT TO THROW THE
BOOK AT RICE.
SPECIFICALLY A BOOK TITLEDSO YOU'RE SENTENCED TO
COUNSELLING, A VIOLENTOFFENDER'S GUIDE TO LENIENT
PUNISHMENT.
BUT NOT TO WORRY, THE NFLJUMPED IN TO FILL THE
JUSTICE VOID.
>> NFL COMMISSIONER ROGERGOODELL SLAPPED RAY RICE
WITH A TWO GAME SUSPENSION.
>> Jon: TWO!
NOT ONE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT TWO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)TWO!
A TWO-GAME SLAP.
TWO GAME SLAP, ONE FOR EACHWRIST.
DON'T. NO.
THEN AFTER A RATHERVOCIFEROUS AND NEGATIVE
RESPONSE TO THE PERCEIVEDCODDLING OF THE ALL-PRO
ELEVATOR PUNCHER, THE NFLRECOGNIZED THE ERRORS OF ITS
WAYS.
>> THE NFL ANNOUNCINGPLAYERS WILL GET A SIX GAME
SUSPENSION FOR THEIR FIRSTDOMESTIC VIOLENCE
OFFENSE.
>> Jon: AH!
LET THAT BE A LESSON.
TO NFL PLAYERS EVERYWHERE.
IF YOU HIT A WOMAN, THEYWILL NOT LET YOU HIT A MAN
FOR SIX MORE WEEKS.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS--
(APPLAUSE)I WOULD SAY AT THAT POINT
CASE CLOSED.
UNTIL THIS WEEK.
>> IT'S THE SECOND SHOCKINGVIDEO TO SURFACE.
TMZ RELEASING THIS TAPE OFBALTIMORE RAVENS PLAYER RAY
RICE BRUTALLY KNOCKING OUTHIS THEN FIANCEE JANAY
PALMER.
>> THE NFL AMMENDED HISTWO-GAME SENTENCE AND
KICKED HIM OUT OF THE LEAGUEINDEFINITELY.
>> NIKE CUT TIES WITHRAY RICE, SCRUBBED ALL RICE
ITEMS FROM THEIR WEB STORE. INBALTIMORE LOCAL MERCHANTS
HAVE LAUNCHED A KINDOF BUYBACK PROGRAM TO GET
RICE JERSEYS OFF THE STREET.
>> Jon: RICEARONI ISCHANGING ITS NAME.
IT WILL NOW BE REFERRED TOAS SIMMERED GRAIN-A-RONI.
RICE UNIVERSITY WILL NOW BEREFERRED TO AS THE
UNIVERSITY WHERE WE DO NOTPUNCH LADIES IN ELEVATORS.
WHERE TO TURN.
WHERE TO TURN.
THAT IS AN UNWIELDY NAME FORA UNIVERSITY.
WHERE TO TURN FORPERSPECTIVE ON A CASE LIKE
THIS.
WELL, THIS BEING THE NFL, ITTURNS OUT YOU COULD TURN TO
ANOTHER MAN NAMED RAY WHOPLAYED FOR THE BALTIMORE
RAVENS AND WAS ALSO PUNISHEDFOR HIS PART IN A VIOLENT
CRIME.
>> PEOPLE WILL TRY TO DRAWTHIS COMPARISON, HOW DO YOU
SEE THAT.
>> THERE IS NO COMPARISON,YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO
COMPARISON OF ME AND RAYRICE.
IT'S NIGHT AND DAY.
IT'S NIGHT AND DAY OFANYTHING WE'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH
AND THAT'S WHY BOTH SITUATIONSARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: HOW DARE YOU SAYWE'RE THE SAME?
I WOULD NEVER HIT A WOMAN!
I WOULD OBSTRUCTJUSTICE IN A MURDER CASE BUT
THAT-- BUT THAT IS WHERE IDRAW THE LINE.
(LAUGHTER)MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT
VIDEO IS-- IS WHAT HAPPENSNEXT.
>> STEVE, WHAT'S YOURREACTION?
>> OOF.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: OOF INDEED.
BUT HERE'S MY MAIN QUESTION.
BACK IN JULY THE NFL FELTTHIS CRIME WAS ONLY WORTHY
OF A TWO GAME SUSPENSION.
BUT NOW SUDDENLY IT'S ALIFETIME OF EXILE.
SO WHAT CHANGED?
>> DID YOU REALLY NEED TOSEE A VIDEOTAPE OF RAY RICE
PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE TOMAKE THIS DECISION?
>> NO, WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T.
AND I WOULD TELL YOU THATWHAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST
VIDEOTAPE WAS TROUBLING TOUS IN AND OF ITSELF.
BUT WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAYWAS EXTREMELY CLEAR, IS
EXTREMELY GRAPHIC, AND ITWAS SICKENING.
AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK THEACTION WE TOOK YESTERDAY.
>> Jon: SO YOU DID NEED TOSEE RAY RICE PUNCHING HER IN
THE FACE TO MAKE THISDECISION WHICH BEGS THE
QUESTION, WHY HADN'TYOU SEEN THAT VIDEO.
>> WE ASKED FOR VIDEO, BUTWE WERE NEVER GRANTED THAT
OPPORTUNITY.
>> Jon: GRANTED THATOPPORTUNITY.
YOU WERE NEVER GRANTED THATOPPORTUNITY.
REALLY?
THE KING OF VIDEO NEVERBESTOWED UPON YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU ARE JUSTA SIMPLE PEASANT BOY
COMMISSIONER ARMED WITH ONLYYOUR WIT, THE CLOTHES UPON
YOUR BACK AND BILLIONS INDOLLARS WORTH OF THE MOST
HIGH-POWERED TEAM OF LAWYERSIN THE HISTORY OF MAN.
OH, LITTLE OLIVER.
PLEASE, SIR, PLEASE, SIR.
(APPLAUSE)MAY I?
PLEASE, SIR, MAY I SEE THETAPE?
THE TAPE, NO!
HERE'S THE ONLY PROBLEM WITHTHAT STORY.
>> THE AP IS NOW REPORTINGTHAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL DID, INDEED, SEND ACOPY OF THE RAY RICE VIDEO
TO AN NFL EXECUTIVE BACK INAPRIL.
>> Jon: YOU DONE [BLEEP] UP.WELL IT ONLY MAKES SENSING
APRIL, THAT'S THE OFF SEASON.
(LAUGHTER)SO YOU HAD THE TAPE, AND YOU
WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT YOUDID NOT LOOK AT IT?
WELL, I THINK WE'RE ALLPRETTY AWARE OF THE NFL'S
OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE TAPEWATCHING ADDICTIONS.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOU GET 24ANGLES AND HIGH RES SLOW
MOTION JUST TO SEE WHETHEROR NOT A MAN'S KNEE GOES
OVER AN IMAGINARY LINEBEFORE HIS HAND CROSSES A
DIFFERENT IMAGINARY LINE.
AND THAT IN STADIUM SYSTEMHAS A BUILT-IN REMOTE
BACKUP.
>> IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CALLIS CHALLENGED THE NFL
OFFICIATING COMMAND CENTERIN NEW YORK WILL BEGIN
REVIEWING REPLAYS.
>> Jon: THE NFL OFFICIATINGCOMMAND CENTER.
YOU'D THINK THEY WERELAUNCHING NUKES RATHER THAN
CONFIRMING IF THE BALL HAD,INDEED, TOUCHED THE GROUND
FIRST.
(LAUGHTER)SO NFL, PERHAPS NEXT TIME
YOU ATTEMPT TO BURY THEDAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT
YOUR LEAGUE'S CONDUCT, IGUESS WE'LL KNOW TO THROW THE
RED CHALLENGE FLAG.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
