>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE FORMERIRAQ AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, HAMID AL-BAYATI, WILLBE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT, AUTHOR
OF THE BOOK "FROM DICTATORSHIPTO DEMOCRACY," WHICH I IMAGINE
FOR THE PAPERBACK THERE WILLPROBABLY OBVIOUSLY BE AN
ADDENDUM, DEPENDING ONWHERE IT GOES NEXT.
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES ALEGAL RULING COMES DOWN THAT
MAKES EVERYONE SAY, WHAT?
WE'RE JUST GETTING AROUND TOTHAT NOW?
LIKE WHEN MISSISSIPPI FINALLYRATIFIED THE 13th AMENDMENT
BANNING SLAVERY.
[LAUGHTER]UM, LAST YEAR.
LAUGHTER OR WHEN THE SUPREMECOURT RULED RECENTLY YOU CAN NO
LONGER USE KITTENS FOR SKEETSHOOTING.
[LAUGHTER][AUDIENCE REACTS]
BEFORE YOU, OH, THAT CAT DOESLOOK LIKE IT'S ATTACKING.
IT MAY JUST BE THE VISUAL.
THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HAPPYKITTY.
BUT THESE LEGAL DECISIONS ARETHE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT
"JON STEWART."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I HAD SAID WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT
ONE SO IF WE CAN JUST... IDON'T THINK THAT THAT... I DON'T
THINK THAT THAT... I DON'T THINKTHAT THAT'S BETTER...
[LAUGHTER][CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S NOT EVEN A LEGAL PUN.
THAT'S JUST... THERE YOU GO!
"THURSDAY NIGHT LAW."
ANYWAY, OUR FIRST STORY INVOLVESA SPORTS FRANCHISE WHOSE NAME IS
A BIT OF A QUAINT REFERENCE TOTHE PERCEIVED COLOR OF THE SKIN
OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPENT A COUPLEOF THOUSAND YEARS PREPARING THIS
COUNTRY FOR US TO DISCOVER.
>> TODAY THE U.S. PATENT OFFICEREVOKED THE TEAM'S TRADEMARK,
CALLING THE NAME A RACIAL SLURIN BLATANT VIOLATION IN
PROHIBITION AGAINST DISPARAGINGTRADEMARKS.
>> Jon: WHOA, THEY SAID THEYNO LONGER HAVE THE NAME BECAUSE
IT'S A RACIAL SLUR. YOU KNOW,THAT'S THE SAME REASON WHY
NOTRE DAME HAD TO CHANGE THEIRMONIKER TO "THE FIGHTING IRISH"
FROM "THE DRUNK GOOD FORNOTHING FIGHTING IRISH."
PLEASE, PLEASE SEND YOURANGRY LETTERS TO BRIAN WILLIAMS
CARE OF NBC NEWS. SO THEREDSKINS NO LONGER OWN THE
EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THEIR OWNNAME, MEANING ANYONE IS FREE
TO FLOOD THE MARKET WITHREDSKINS BRANDED PRODUCTS OF ANY
KIND FROM BUTT CREAMS TO, IDON'T KNOW, REDSKINS OWNER
SIZED CONDOMS. THAT'SAN ACTUAL PENNY.
ALL I'M SAYING IS THE REDSKINS'OWNER HAS A TINY [BLEEPED].
WHAT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THECONTROVERSY IS.
PERHAPS NOW REDSKINS' OWNERDANIEL SNYDER WILL FINALLY
CONCEDE THAT THIS NAME IS NOLONGER TENABLE.
>> TODAY THE TEAM SAID IT WOULDAPPEAL.
THE OWNER OF THE TEAM, DANIELSNYDER, HAS REFUSED TO CHANGE
THE NAME CITING TRADITION.
>> Jon: OH, TRADITION.
SO YOUR ARGUMENT IN KEEPING YOURNAME IS YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN
HERE AND TAKE OVER OUR ANCESTRALPROPERTY IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
YOU'RE SAYING... I GUESS WHATYOU'RE SAYING IS WE HAD IT
FIRST.
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS, IT WOULDBE LIKE THIS I GUESS, IF A GROUP
OF PEOPLE TAUGHT YOU HOW THESURVIVE A HARSH WINTER AND THEN
YOU INVITED THAT GROUP OF PEOPLETO A FEAST TO SHOW YOUR
GRATITUDE TO THEM FOR HELPINGYOU TO SURVIVE AND THEN AFTER
DESSERT LET'S SAY YOU KILLEDTHEM AND TOOK THEIR LAND AND
THEN YEARS LATER TO COMMEMORATETHAT DAY, YOU HELD AN
ANNUAL FEAST THAT INCLUDED ASPORTING EVENT IN WHICH ONE
OF THE PARTICIPATING TEAM'SNAMES WAS A DEROGATORY TERM FOR
THE ORIGINAL PEOPLE THATYOU HAD KILLED.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE REDSKINS!
THE REDSKINS, NOT THE PACKERS.
SWITCH IT.
GET A NEW NAME ALREADY.
IT'S THE 21st CENTURY.
