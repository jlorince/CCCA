>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
TONIGHT'S PROGRAM HANDCRAFTED
LOVINGLY USING ONLY THE FINEST
HOPS AND PUREST SPRING WATER.
[LAUGHTER]
MY GUEST TONIGHT POLITICAL
PUNDIT MEGAN McCAIN, DAUGHTER
OF THE SENATOR OF THE SAME NAME,
MEGAN McCAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT ABOUT
THE SENATOR.
IF THE PATTERN HOLDS TRUE WITH
THE FAMILY, SHELL RETURN TO THIS
PROGRAM 12 MORE TIMES AND THEN
NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT SPEAKING OF POLITICS, BY THE
WAY, HIT ME!
♪ ARE YOU READY FOR SOME MID
TERMS ♪
>> Jon: WOW, WORST HANK
WILLIAMS IMPRESSION EVER.
MID TERMS ARE UPON US ONCE MORE.
BEFORE WE DISCUSS THE MID TERM
ELECTIONS I WANTED TO REMIND YOU
GUYS THIS PERSON, THE IDEALISTIC
YOUNG POLITICIAN WITH BIG DREAMS
OF HOW THE WORLD WORKED.
THERE IS NOT A LIBERAL AMERICA
AND A CONSERVATIVE AMERICA.
THERE'S THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN TO WORK WITH ALL OF
YOU, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT, REMIND
OURSELVES THAT WE HAVE THINGS IN
COMMON, FAMILY, FRIENDS,
LAUGHTER.
>> Jon: AH -- PERISTALSIS.
WE'RE ALL ASTOUND BY FIRE,
WATER, AIR AND DIRT (bleep)
MAGNETS HOW THEY WORK.
REALLY?
INSANE CLOWN POSSE FANS, ALL
RIGHT.
THAT NICE YOUNG MAN WENT ON TO
BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES AND FINALLY HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BRIDGE THE DEEP
PARTISAN DIVIDE THAT PARALYZED
OUR NATION'S GOVERNMENT.
HOW DID THAT GO FOR HIM?
>> THE EASIEST THING FOR THE
OTHER SIDE TO DO IS TO RIDE THIS
FEAR AND ANGER ALL THE WAY TO
ELECTION DAY.
MOST OF THE REPUBLICANS IN
CONGRESS HAVE SAID NO JUST ABOUT
EVERY POLICY I HAVE PROPOSED
SINCE TAKING OFFICE.
NO TO INFRASTRUCTURE.
THERE WERE NO NEW POLL AT POLICIES
FOR BEFORE BANER IN NEW YORK NEW
IDEAS.
POLITICS PURE AND SIMPLE.
I FAIL, THEY WIN.
>> Jon: THAT MAY BE AS CLOSE
AS ANY PRESIDENT IN THE UNITED
STATES HAS EVER COME TO SAYING
(bleep) ALL Y'ALL.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT HEY, HEY -- BUT WAIT -- AT
LEAST WE ALL STILL HAVE
LAUGHTER.
[LAUGHTER]
AS IF OH, MY GOD REMEMBER THAT
GUY THAT WE BELIEVED WE WOULD
WORK WITH HIM.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA.
THE PRESIDENT MAKING HIS CASE
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS
BECAUSE, A, THAT WILL KEEP THAT
SWEET, SWEET STIMULUS COMING,
AND B, IT TURNS OUT THE
REPUBLICANS ARE KIND OF
(bleep) TO DEAL WITH.
CLEARLY THIS MAN IS IN MID
SEASON, MID TERM ELECTION FORM.
OF COURSE, HE IS JUST ONE MAN IN
A GYMNASIUM IN OHIO.
IT'S WHAT WE'RE TOLD HE SAYS.
WOULD THE CABLE NETWORKS SHAKE
OFF THEIR SUMMER OF KILLER
MOSQUE COBWEBS AND DIVE IN.
FOX?
>> A SPEECH TODAY LIKE THE
POLICIES HE IS ADVOCATING LOOK
LIKE DESPERATION.
>> BOTTOM LINE THIS WAS THE
PRESIDENT IN CAMPAIGN MODE.
>> HE BLAMED BUSH.
HE BLAMED THE G.O.P.
HE BLAMED BANER IN.
>> CLASS WARFARE IS BACK.
>> IT WASN'T WHAT, I THINK, OHIO
WANTED.
IS THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TOO
LITTLE TOO LATE?
>> I THINK IT WAS TOO MUCH TOO
EARLY.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW BRAVO, BRAVO.
YOU HAD ME AT HE SUCKS.
[LAUGHTER]
CLEARLY MSNBC IS GOING TO HAVE
THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.
>> LET'S START WITH THE
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH IN OHIO
TODAY.
WHAT A HUMDINGER IT WAS.
>> HE LOOKED, TO USE HIS PHRASE,
FIRED UP.
>> HIS RHETORIC IS COMPELLING.
>> HE GOT HIS VOICE BACK.
>> SPEAKING WITH PASSION AND
EMPATHY.
>> THIS IS THE BEST SPEECH WE'VE
GOTTEN FROM HIM SINCE HE HAS
BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Jon: DARLING IT WAS
FANTASTIC.
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT JAMIE
LEE CURTIS AND THE LEAD SINGER
OF RIGHT SAID FRED BLOG ABOUT IT
ON MY WEB SITE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE WITH
YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ACCENT THAT
WAS.
[LAUGHTER]
PRAISE TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE
LIBERAL COUNTER WEIGHT.
>> BUT,.
>> BUT --
>> BUT --
>> BUT --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: BUT?
>> BUT AS YOU KNOW ONE SPEECH
DOES NOT CHANGE THE NARRATIVE.
>> THE FACT THAT THERE'S A GAP
BETWEEN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS
AND DOES, THAT'S A HUGE RISK FOR
HIM.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[LAUGHTER]
DID YOU KNOW NOTHING OF YOUR
OBLIGATION TO SHAPE THE NEWS
TOWARDS YOUR DESIRED ELECTORAL
GOAL?
THERE'S NO BUT IN JOURNALISM.
HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING FROM
FOX YOU?  PICK THE NARRATIVE AND
STICK WITH IT.
IF THE NEWS DOESN'T FIT YOUR
NARRATIVE, CHANGE YOUR (bleep)
NEWS.
FOR GOD'S SAKE.
PEOPLE!
YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR NARRATIVE.
WATCH HOW THE MASTERS DO IT.
>> THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE A RARE
MOMENT OF HONESTY DURING HIS
SPEECH AND I HOPE VOTERS AROUND
THE COUNTRY ARE WATCHING THIS.
>> TAXES ARE SCHEDULED TO GO UP
SUBSTANTIALLY NEXT YEAR FOR
EVERYBODY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNOW THE ANOINTED ONE WILL
MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS.
>> Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
WOULD BLURT OUT EVERYBODY'S
TAXES ARE GOING TO GO UP
SUBSTANTIALLY PROBABLY BECAUSE
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HERE IS THE SLIGHTLY LESS
ABRIDGED VERSION.
>> UNDER THE TAX PLAN PASSED BY
THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, TAXES
ARE SCHEDULED TO GO UP
SUBSTANTIALLY NEXT YEAR FOR
EVERYBODY.
BY THE WAY, THIS WAS BY DESIGN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SEE?
MSNBC, AMATEURS, STARTING CLIPS
LATER AND CUTTING THEM OFF
BEFORE THE SPEAKER FINISHED THE
THOUGHTS FULL CONSTRUCTION CAN
BE A USEFUL TOOL IN HELPING YOUR
AUDIENCE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
WANT THEM TO THINK.
IT'S A FUN AND EASY WAY TO MAKE
PEOPLE YOU DISAGREE WITH SAY
THINGS THAT MAKE THEM
UNELECTABLE.
NOT THAT THE REPUBLICANS NEED
ANY HELP MAKING THEMSELVES
UNELECTABLE.
THIS IS JOHN BOEHNER ANNOUNCING
THE JOB PLAN IN A MOMENT OF
TKAPBDOR.
>> WE'RE GOING TO SHIP MILLIONS
OF JOBS OVERSEAS.
>> Jon: WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
WHY WOULD YOU -- WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?
YOU MUST REALLY HATE THE WORKING
MAN.
I BET IF WE PLAY THAT OUT IT
WOULD END WITH BANER IN THROW --
BOEHNER THROWING MONKEY POOP.
IT'S A SHAME WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO LOOK AT THE FULL CLIP.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S DIFFICULT TO WATCH COVERAGE
ON HYPERPARTISAN NETWORKS.
LET'S SEE WHAT CNN'S RESPONSE
WAS.
>> MOMENTS AGO THE REPUBLICAN
ARE NOT LEADER JOHN BOEHNER SENT
ME A TWEET -- THE SENATE
MINORITY LEADER JOHN BOEHNER
SENT ME A TWEET PERSONALLY.
>> Jon: YOU ARE A NEWS MAN,
NOT A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WON A
MEET JUSTIN BEIBER CONTEST.
>> HE SENT IT TO US.
>> Jon: PERHAPS I COULD HAVE
MY AUDIENCE SEND SOME RICK
SANCHEZ TWEETS CARE OF SEND A
TWIT A TWEET.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
RICK, I'M KIDDING OBVIOUSLY YOU
ARE NOT A TOTAL MEATHEAD.
>> BY THE WAY, I SAID THE
PRESIDENT WAS IN COLUMBUS.
HE'S CLOSER TO CLEVELAND TODAY.
I'M THINKING COLUMBUS BECAUSE
I'M FIRED UP ABOUT THE MIAMI
OHIO STATE GAME THIS WEEKEND.
>> Jon: LIKE FOOTBALL.
FOOTBALL ALWAYS ON SANCHEZ MIND.
SANCHEZ YE
