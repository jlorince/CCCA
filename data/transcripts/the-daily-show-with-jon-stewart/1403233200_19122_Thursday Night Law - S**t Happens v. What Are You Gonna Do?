HARD TO THINK OF ANY OTHERCHANGE THAT'S THIS LONG OVERDUE.
>> A NEW BILL IN JAPAN OUTLAWSTHE POSSESSION OF CHILD
PORNOGRAPHY.
>> Jon: DID NOT SEE THATCOMING.
[LAUGHTER]DID YOU SAY "A NEW BILL-- A NEW
BILL." THAT MAKES JAPANMAYBE THE ONLY COUNTRY
TO INVENT A ROBOT WHO CAN MAKEPANCAKES BEFORE
OUTLAWING THE POSSESSION OFCHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THE PANCAKEROBOT, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT.
I REALLY HOPE THIS IS JUSTBECAUSE JAPAN HAS NO CHILD PORN.
AND THEN THEY PASS THISLEGISLATION IN CASE ANYONE EVER
GOT IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE OUR VOTERI.D. LAWS TO PREVENT FRAUD.
IT'S JUST THEORETICAL, RIGHT.
>> ON THE STREETS OF TOKYOSEX SELLS, MAGAZINES AND
VIDEOS, SO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT,PORNOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OF
YOUNG GIRLS ENGAGED IN VIOLENTSEX OFTENTIMES WITH OLDER MEN.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I THINK WE ALL OWE
GODZILLA AN APOLOGY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]ANYWAY, I GUESS,
CONGRATULATIONS, JAPAN, BETTERLATE THAN NEVER.
>> BUT GRAPHIC CARTOONS, EVENONES SHOWING KIDS BEING RAPED,
WILL STAY LEGAL.
WHY?
BECAUSE ANIME ANIMATION ANDMANGA COMICS ARE A MULTIBILLION
DOLLAR INDUSTRY WITH POLITICALAND LOBBYING POWER.
>> Jon: THAT IS EMBARRASSING,JAPAN.
THAT IS EMBARRASSING.
HOW CAN A LOBBY FOR HARMFUL,DESTRUCTIVE INDUSTRY TAKE
PRECEDENCE OVER THE PROTECTIONOF CHILDREN?
I AM FRANKLY... I AM...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I AM SHOCKED.
I AM UPSET.
SPEAKING OF, SPEAKING OFAMERICA'S NATIONAL WEAPON, THE
GUN, THE SUPREME COURT RECENTLYHEARD A CASE INVOLVING SAID
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTEDFREEDOM MAKER.
>> BRUCE ABRAMSKI WAS A FORMERVIRGINIA POLICE OFFICER.
HE OFFERED TO BUY THE GUN FORHIS UNCLE WHO LIVED IN
PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE HE THOUGHTHE COULD GET A DISCOUNT.
THE UNCLE GAVE HIM THE MONEYWHEN HE BOUGHT THE GUN.
HE CHECKED THE BOX ON A FORMTHAT ASKED IF HE WAS THE ACTUAL
BUYER.
>> Jon: I DON'T SEE THEPROBLEM THERE.
HE MERELY LIED TO THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT ON A FORM IN ORDER TO
DEFRAUD A GUN DEALER OF AFULL-PRICE SALE. I DON'T,
LOOK, I'M SURE THE FORMS ARECONFUSING.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE FORM CLEARLYSTATES, "QUESTION 11A: ARE YOU
THE ACTUAL BUYER.
WARNING, YOU ARE NOT THE ACTUALBUYER IF YOU ARE ACQUIRING THE
FIREARM ON BEHALF OF ANOTHERPERSON. I UNDERSTAND THAT
ANSWERING YES TO QUESTION 11A IFI'M NOT THE ACTUALY BUYER IS A
CRIME PUNISHABLE AS AFELONY UNDER FEDERAL LAW."
THAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING.
[LAUGHTER]I'M NOT A LEGAL SCHOLAR, BUT I'M
GUESSING THIS IS GOING TO BRINGUS ONE OF THEM WHATCHU CALL
IT THERE 9-0 DECISIONS INTHE SUPREME COURT.
>> IN A 5-4 DECISION, THE COURTRULED THAT THE BUYERS MUST TELL
THE TRUTH WHEN THEY ARE BUYINGGUNS FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
>> Jon: WHAT?
WAIT.
SO FOUR JUSTICES, FOUR JUSTICESON THE NATION'S HIGHEST COURT
RULED THAT WHEN BUYING GUNS, YOUCAN LIE.
>> AS SOON AS I BUY IT, I WALKOUT OF THE STORE AND I MEET THIS
GUY IN THE PARKING LOT.
HE SAYS, HEY, THAT'S ANIFTY-LOOKING GUN THERE.
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT?
HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, I PAID $600.
I'LL GIVE YOU $700.
IT'S YOURS.
RIGHT?
I CAN HAND IT TO HIM, CAN'T I?
>> Jon: YES, AND THEN HE CANGET HIS $700 BACK AT WHAT I CAN
ONLY ASSUME IS GUNPOINT.
SO, YES, THERE IS APPARENTLY NOPROHIBITION ON TRANSFERRING THE
GUN AFTER YOU BUY IT, SO WHAT'SYOUR POINT, SCALIA?
>> THE NOTION THAT THE GUN WOULDSOMEHOW GET INTO THE HANDS OF
SOMEBODY WHO, YOU KNOW, WHOWASN'T REGISTERED OR COULDN'T
BUY IT HIMSELF, I MEAN, THAT'SGOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.
WHAT YOU ASSERT DOES NOT STOPTHAT PROBLEM.
>> Jon: SCALIA IS ACTUALLYREFERRING TO THE
PRECEDENT-MAKING CASE BLEEPHAPPENS V.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? IGUESS THE REAL TAKEAWAY IS
THIS, THIS IS WHAT'S CRAZY. SO,SO THE REAL TAKEAWAY FROM THIS
IS, SO YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWEDTO BUY A GUN AT A GUN
STORE AFTER GOING THROUGH SOMETYPE OF QUESTIONNAIRE BACKGROUND
CHECK.
BUT THEN YOU CAN JUST SELL IT ORGIVE IT TO THE FIRST PERSON YOU
SEE IN A PARKING LOT.
SO MY ADVICE TO YOU IS THE NEXTTIME YOU SEE A GUY COME AT YOU
IN PARKING LOT WAVING A GUN,DON'T BE AFRAID.
HE'S JUST EXCITED AT WHAT AGREAT DEAL HE JUST GOT.
[LAUGHTER]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
