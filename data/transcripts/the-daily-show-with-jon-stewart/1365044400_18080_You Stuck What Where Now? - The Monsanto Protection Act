LOBBYIST CHECK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BILL NOBODY KNEW ABOUT?
>> TUCKED AWAY IN THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION ARE HIDDEN ITEMS ON GUNS MAKING PERMANENT SOME OF
THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO REGULATE GUNS.
>> Jon: IT'S GREAT TO SEE CONGRESS IS MAKING PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL CONTROL S.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY GIVEN THAT SENATORS CAN HOLD PIECES OF SLAITION AND FILIBUSTER
APPOINTOS -- APPOINTEES AND THIS IS THE GENERAL LAW MAKING BODY.
>> I BELIEVE THE SENATE OUGHT TO SLOW THINGS DOWN.
>> WE NEED MORE DEBATE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T RUSH IT.
>> SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND WORK IT THROUGH.
>> AMERICANS WANT US TO TAKE OUR TIME AND GET THINGS RIGHT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S (bleep) WE NEED.
WHY COULDN'T ANYONE PREVENT THE WEIRD AMENDMENTS FROM HAPPENING?
>> THEY SAID IF THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FROM SHUTTING DOWN THEY NEEDED TO GET
THIS THROUGH.
THERE WAS NO TAKE IT OUT.
>> Jon: RIGHT BECAUSE THIS WAS A REDZ LIEWTION THAT KEPT IT FUNDED FOR SIX MONTHS.
IT HAD TO GO THROUGH.
NOW THAT YOU HAUTE THE AMENDMENTS VERSUS WHAT WE NEED.
IN THE REPORT INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR.
SUNDAY REPORT, ANYTHING.
WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING.
AFTER HEARING THIS YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF JON I'M NOT COMPLETELY ANGRY AND UPSET.
MAY I?
[LAUGHTER]
ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT THE SNEAKY BASTARDS DOING THE DIRTY WORK OF THE AGRA BUSINESS LOBBY?
IT TURNS OUT IT WAS SLIPPED INTO THE LEGISLATION ANONYMOUSLY
[AUDIENCE REACTS] OOOOH SAYS THE AUDIENCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT TURNS OUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INVOLVED IN WRITING A BILL WHILE THE BILL IS IN SUBCOMMITTEE ARE
ALLOWED TO ADD ANY PROVISION THEY WANT ANONYMOUSLY, NO FINGERPRINTS.
THE LAWS OF THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH ARE WRITTEN WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY
AS INTERNET COMMENTS.
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT FAIR, INTERNET COMMENTS HAVE AN IP ADDRESS AND THEY ARE RELATIVELY TRACEABLE.
NONE OF THIS WOULD BE SURPRISING IF WE PAID CLOSER ATTENTION ON SATURDAY MORNINGS GROWING UP.
♪ I'M ONLY A BILL AND I'M SITTING HERE ON CAPITOL HILL ♪
>> I'M JUST A BILL I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.
MONSANTO.
THAT'S EXIT ONLY FELLA!
OW!
CONGRATULATIONS NOW YOU ARE A LAW.
>> DEMOCRACY HURTS MY ASS.
>> Jon: CONGRATULATIONS LAW, WE'
