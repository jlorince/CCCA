>> Jon: BUT FIRST, WE HAD ALITTLE BIT OF ROUGH NEWS OUT
OF CONGRESS YESTERDAY. ILLINOISCONGRESSMAN AND DOOGIE
HOWSER WANNABE AARONSCHOCK FAMOUS FOR HIS
DOWNTON ABBEY STYLE OFFICEAND PIMPED OUT INSTAGRAM
FEED HAS COME TO A DECISION.
>> CONGRESSMAN AARON SCHOCKIS RESIGNING FROM CONGRESS.
>> I DO THIS WITH A HEAVYHEART.
>> BUT HE SAID THE CONSTANTQUESTIONS OVER THE LAST SIX
WEEKS HAVE PROVEN A GREATDISTRACTION THAT HAS MADE IT
TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME TOSERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE 18th
DISTRICT WITH THE HIGHSTANDARDS THEY DESERVE WHICH
I HAVE SET FOR MYSELF.
>> Jon: REALLY, REALLY,REALLY?
THE CONSTANT SCANDALQUESTIONS ARE TOO MUCH OF A
DISTRACTION FOR YOU.
NOT THE ZIP LINING THROUGH ARAINFOREST OR PARASAILING IN
ARGENTINA OR CHILLING WITHBUDDHIST MONKS IN MYANMAR.
YOU SERVED THREE TERMS INCONGRESS WHILE APPARENTLY
ALSO COMPETING ON THEAMAZING RACE.
BUT IT'S THE QUESTIONS THATHAVE YOU ALL [BLEEP] UP.
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS!
STILL I IMAGINE RESIGNING ISTHE HARDEST THING SCHOCK
WILL EVER HAVE TO DO EXCEPTFOR PERHAPS CLEANING OUT HIS
DESK.
HEY ANYBODY KNOW THE BEST WAY TOBUBBLE WRAP PHEASANT FEATHERS?
ANYBODY?
I HAVE TO SAY, I DIDN'TTHINK IT WOULD COME TO THIS.
>> QUESTIONS ABOUT TAXPAYERFUNDED EXPENSES INCLUDING
5,000 DOLLARS FOR A REPLICAOF THE PRESIDENTIAL PODIUM.
>> HE USED TAXPAYER MONEY TOTAKE A PRIVATE PLANE TO A
CHICAGO BEARS GAME.
>> TAKING TEN STAFFERS ON AWEEKEND TRIP TO NEW YORK.
>> ALSO REPORTEDLY TOOK HISINTERNS TO AN OUT OF STATE
KATY PERRY CONCERT.
>> Jon: OH!
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, DON'TBOO-- COME ON, THE INTERNS
CAN'T GO TO AN IN-STATE KATYPERRY CONCERT.
I'M SORRY I MAY JUST BE ANINTERN, BUT I'M ALSO A
FIREWORK, AND THUS I MUST SEEKATY PERRY IN A STATE WHERE
FIREWORKS ARE LEGAL, SO -- WHILE SCHOCK'S SPENDING HAD
BEEN QUESTIONABLE.
REALLY?
REALLY, THAT'S WHAT YOU WEREWAITING FOR, THE LITTLE OVER
THE SHOULDER?
WE GOT US SOME READERS.
BUT WHILE SCHOCK'S SPENDING HADBEEN QUESTIONABLE, IT DIDN'T
NECESSARILY SEEMPROSECUTABLE UNTIL YESTERDAY.
>> HE BILLED THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT FOR 170,000MILES ON HIS PERSONAL CAR.
HERE IS THE THING, WHEN HESOLD IT LAST YEAR "POLITICO"
SAYS THE VEHICLE ONLY HADABOUT 80,000 MILES ON THE
ODOMETER.
>> Jon: I THINK I KNOW WHATHAPPENED.
CONGRESSMAN SCHOCK SIMPLYDROVE HIS TAHOE 90,000 MILES
BACKWARDS BECAUSEHE KNOWS AS A CROSS FIT
ENTHUSIAST IT'S HEALTHIER FORTHE CAR, BURNS MORE CALORIES,
PROMOTES NEUROMUSCULAREFFICIENCY AND IS EASIER
ON THE AUTOMOBILE'S WHEELS.
YOU THINK SCHOCKS AB'S ARESICK, CHECK OUT HIS CAR.
I MEAN THAT-- LOOK ATTHAT! CONGRESSMAN, WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO RUIN YOUR FUN MAYBEFRAUD PARTY WITH WHAT APPEARS
TO BE ACTUAL FRAUD?
YOU WENT FROM THE COOL RATO THE SHADY GUY MIKE
WALLACE WOULD CORNER AT HISOFFICE TO EXPOSE ON
TELEVISION.
>> THIS IS MY THINGS.
>> Jon: THOSE ARE HIS THINGS.
WELL THIS IS CERTAINLY ANEMBARRASSING EPISODE BUT AT
LEAST-- AT LEAST HIS PARENTSARE STANDING FIRMLY BY HIS
SIDE.
>> TEN YEARS FROM NOW,WHATEVER HE IS DOING, HE
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AT, IPROMISE YOU THAT.
TWO YEARS FROM NOW HE WILLBE SUCCESSFUL.
BECAUSE-- IF HE'S NOT INJAIL.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: LISTEN TO ME, DON'T
SELL HIM SHORT.
EVEN IF HE IS IN JAIL, ITHINK HE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
THERE AS WELL.
HE'S GONNA BE THE BADDEST ASS INTHE WHOLE CLINKER, MAN.
NOT ONLY WILL HE CUT YOU,HE'S GOING TO INSTAGRAM THAT
[BLEEP].
