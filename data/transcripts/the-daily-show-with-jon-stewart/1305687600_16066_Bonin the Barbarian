>> Jon: WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO
"THE DAILY ANTHENAEUM" SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT,
FOLKS.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ANNIE
JACOBSEN.
SHE'S AUTHOR OF THE BOOKARY"
51."
SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE BIT OF TONIGHT, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN?
TRUTH.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, OBVIOUSLY OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF WEEKS, THERE HAVE BEEN
A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES
THAT WE'VE HAD TO DISCUSS HERE
ON THE PROGRAM, ISSUES THAT MAY
HAVE BEEN WAYLAID BY PERHAPS
MORE PRESSING ISSUES THAT WE'VE
HAD TO DISCUSS, LIKE THE DEATH
OF BIN LADEN, THE HARD-CORE PORN
IN BIN LADEN'S HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
HARD-CORE POETS, RHYMING IN THE
PEOPLE'S HOUSE, AND FINALLY THE
DISTRACTIONS ARE OVER.
WE HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" CAN
GET BACK TO OUR CORE MISSION,
DISCUSSING THE IMPORTANT ISSUES
OF THE DAY, SUCH AS IMMIGRATION
POLICY IN A RESPECTFUL, SOBER
MANNER.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
[LAUGHTER]
TO THE DEBATE.
>> IN A BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT,
FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER NOW ADMITS
TO FATHERING A CHILD WITH A
LONGTIME HOUSEHOLD STAFFER.
>> Jon: OH, FOR [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
THIS CLOSE.
DAMN YOU NEARLY IRRESISTIBLE
COMIC POSSIBILITIES.
FUNNY ACCENT, BUILT-IN MOVIE
POSTER FUN.
SURE, YES, OBVIOUSLY, SURE.
YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE
THESE TONIGHT.
WE JUST SHOWED UP HERE THIS
MORNING AND THEY WERE ALREADY
HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
SOME TYPE OF SNARK FAIRY.
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
THAT'S... I DON'T THINK... WELL,
THAT ACTUALLY COULD BE
"KINDERGARTEN COOK."
[LAUGHTER]
QUIRK?
AH, [BLEEPED].
SOME OF HIS MOVIE TITLES WE
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE.
YEAH.
OR YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
HERE'S THE WORST PART ACTED
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S BALLS
THAT I DID NOT REALIZE,
APPARENTLY THEY ARE PINNED ON
LIKE YOU WOULD DO IN A
CHILDREN'S GAME OF PIN THE BALLS
ON THE SCHWARZENEGGER.
THE QUESTION IS: WHICH ONE OF
THOSE BALLS IS SCHWARZENEGGER
AND WHICH ONE IS DANNY
