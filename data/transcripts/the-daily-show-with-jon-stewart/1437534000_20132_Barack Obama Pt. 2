[CROWD CHEERING]>> Jon:  PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA.
THE MEDIA.
YOU LOVE THEM, THEY LOVE YOU.
SO IS YOUR FRUSTRATION SOMETIMESWITH THE MEDIA, IS THE MEDIA
MYSELF INCLUDED, ARE WE FOCUSEDON THE WRONG THINGS?
ARE WE DEMANDING TOO MUCH OFYOU?
ARE WE DEMANDING TOO MUCH OFGOVERNMENT?
ARE WE TOO INFLAMMATORY?
WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ON IT?
>> FIRST OF ALL, THE MEDIA'S ABUNCH OF DIFFERENT MEDIAS.
[LAUGHTER]THERE ARE SOME THAT GET ON MY
NERVES MORE THAN OTHERS.
I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY.
I THINK I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUTIS NOT THAT IT'S UNFAIR OR THAT
IT'S TOO TOUGH ON GOVERNMENTBECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT
JOURNALISM AND MEDIA IS SUPPOSEDTO BE DOING.
I THINK IT GETS DISTRACTED BYSHINY OBJECTS.
[LAUGHTER]AND DOESN'T ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE
BIG TOUGH CHOICES AND DECISIONSTHAT HAVE TO BE MADE.
AND PART OF THAT IS JUST THECHANGING NATURE OF TECHNOLOGY.
IT IS VERY HARD NOW FOR FOLKS TODO AN HOUR LONG SPECIAL ON THE
OTHER AMERICA LET'S SAY OR SOMEOF THE OTHER CLASSIC
DOCUMENTARIES THAT WERE DONE ALONG TIME AGO.
IT'S TOUGH TO GET EVERYBODY'SATTENTION FOCUSED IN THE SAME
WAY.
AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THATON BIG TOUGH ISSUES, SOMETIMES
IT'S HARD TO GET THE ENTIRENATION'S ATTENTION FOCUSED ON
IT.
AND WE'VE BEEN OPERATING ONTHAT.
BUT LOOK, PART OF MY JOB ANDPART OF THE JOB OF EVERYBODY IN
THE WHITE HOUSE IS HOW DO WEADAPT TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT.
HOW ARE WE MORE NIMBLE.
HOW ARE WE DEALING WITH SOCIALMEDIA.
>> Jon:  HAVE YOU DEALTAPPROPRIATELY WITH THE MEDIA.
WE KNOW MAYBE THE MEDIA'SPROBLEMS.
WHAT ABOUT TALKING POINTS>> ARE THEY USEFUL.
>> Jon:  THEY COME FROM, ISTHAT SOMETHING THAT HAS, HAVE
PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT, HAVEPEOPLE IN ADMINISTRATION, HAS
YOUR OFFICE, HAVE YOURSELF, HAVEYOU BECOME TOO GUARDED IN THE
WAY THAT YOU SPEAK TO THEAMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO PRACTICE
IN THE ART OF SPIN, THAT THECONVERSATION BECOMES
MEANINGLESS.
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TOSAY WE HAD NO TALKING POINTS.
WE HAVE TOO MANY TALKING POINTS.
>> Jon:  NO.
CAN BE CONSTRUED AS EITHERINSINCERE OR --
>> HERE'S WHAT I SAY.
I THINK WHEN YOU ARE OUTSIDE OFGOVERNMENT, YOU FEEL
UNCONSTRAINED IN WAYS THAT WHENYOU ARE IN THE WHITEHOUSE, YOU
RECOGNIZE IF I MAKE THISCOMMENT, IT MAY MOVE THE MARKET
THAT WAY.
OR IF I MAKE THIS COMMENT, I'VEGOT TO MAKE SURE WHAT ARE OUR
ALLIES THINKING ABOUT THATINTERNATIONAL ISSUE.
SO PROBABLY EARLY ON, I THINKTHAT YOU'RE MORE CAUTIOUS.
I ALSO THINK THE STRUCTUREINSIDE THE WHITEHOUSE IS NOT
WELL ADAPTED TO THIS NEWENVIRONMENT.
WE WERE WAY TOO SLOW IN TRYINGTO REDESIGN AND REENGINEER THE
WHITEHOUSE PRESS OFFICE SO THATWE COULD HAVE MORE
UNCONVENTIONAL INTERACTIONS WITHTHE MEDIA AND MORE LONG FORM,
YOU PUT IT ON THE WEB.
YOU DON'T WORRY WHETHER IT'S ONA TIGHT TWO MINUTE PACKAGE GOING
ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS.
THERE'S A LEARNING PROCESSTHAT'S TAKEN PLACE.
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, JON,OVERALL, I DON'T FEEL
PARTICULARLY GUARDED.
I JUST HAD A PRESS CONFERENCEABOUT IRAN WHERE NOT ONLY DID I
STAY THERE FOR AN HOUR, I SAIDWHO ELSE HAS GOT A QUESTION.
>> Jon:  IF YOU DIDN'T FEELGOOD ABOUT THAT DEAL.
>> I THINK THE TRUTH OF THEMATTER IS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
TIMES WHERE I SAT THERE AND WETALKED A LOT ABOUT STUFF WHERE I
DID NOT FEEL AS GOOD ABOUT WHATHAD HAPPENED BUT I FEEL WE HAVE
TO BE ACCOUNTABLE.
OVERALL I THINK THAT THE PROBLEMWITH OUR INTERACTION WITH THE
MEDIA IS PROBABLY OVERSTATED.
I THINK WHAT'S UNDERSTATED ISTHE BALKANIZATION, THE SPLINTING
RING OF THE MEDIA SO IT'S HARDFOR US TO GET ONE CONVERSATION.
YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARECONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR FACTS
THAT REINFORCE THE POINT OF VIEWAS OPPOSED TO HAVING A COMMON
CONVERSATION.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TOTHINK ABOUT, NOT JUST THE
PRESIDENT BUT ALL OF US IS HOWDO WE JOIN TOGETHER IN A COMMON
CONVERSATION AROUND SOMETHINGOTHER THAN THE SUPER BOWL.
>> Jon:  WHO DO YOU HAVE INTHE SUPER BOWL.
>> NOT THE BEARS RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon:  NO.
WE'LL COME BACK MOREWITH PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
RIGHT AFTER THIS.
