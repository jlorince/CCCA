(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, FAREED ZAKARIA MAKING HIS 400th APPEARANCE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) FIRST, OBVIOUSLY, EVERYBODY IS STILL STUNNED AFTER THE TERRIBLE
SHOOTINGS FRIDAY.
ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TYPES OF TRAGEDIES?
I... IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE,
OBVIOUSLY.
AN INTERSECTION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM, CULTURAL INFLUENCES, THE BALANCE BETWEEN
INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY.
THE VIABILITY OF GUNS.
>> I THINK NOW REALLY IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE A BIG NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE... IT'S A FACTOR.
I MEAN... I MEAN, IT'S A FACTOR ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM.
OWNING A GUN IS A RIGHT PROTECTED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT'S... YOU KNOW, I AGREE
WITH THAT.
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT, IT'S RIGHT THERE.
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE TANKS.
(LAUGHTER) SO WE... IF WE DRAW LINES ON WEAPONRY, OBVIOUSLY, THE QUESTION IS HAVE WE DRAWN THEM RIGHT?
>> THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S, FRANKLY
I THINK, INSULTING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO POLITICIZE SOMETHING AS
HORRIFIC AS THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION TO INSULT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC... WHICH I
BELIEVE IS ONE OF THE TOP PUBLICS IN THIS COUNTRY.
AM I RIGHT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE AMERICAN PUBLIC!
I DON'T WANT TO INSULT TIME!
THEY'RE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC!
THEY'RE ONE OF THE TOP THREE PUBLICS IN AMERICA!
(LAUGHTER) I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF THESE TERRIBLE NOT UNGUN RELATED
STORIES CREATE SINUS PRESSURE IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET YOURSELF SOME SUDAFED TO
EASE THAT SINUS PAIN, THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO TO GET SUDAFED.
TO GET THAT GOOD SUDAFED YOU NEED I.D. AND THERE'S A BACKGROUND CHECK AND THEN YOU'VE
GOT TO SIGN (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) SUDAFED I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IS SOME DANGEROUS (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) SO WHILE WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SOCIETAL FACTORS AND MORAL FACTORS, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONRY...
>> TOO EARLY TO BE TALKING ABOUT MORE GUN CONTROL LAWS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: LOOK, TEN YEARS AFTER 9/11 I CAN'T STILL FLY WITH A FULL CONTAINER OF (BLEEP)ING SHAMPOO!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT, I USE THE SAME SHAMPOO AS MY DRESSAGE HORSES.
(LAUGHTER) SO YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S TOO SOON TO EVEN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT?
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT TO DISCUSS THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR
THAT THERE IS A WAITING PERIOD?
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'D HATE TO GO INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS ALL HOT-HEADED.
(LAUGHTER) SAY SOMETHING IMPULSIVELY YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE BACK.
LOOK, THIS IS THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT.
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE.
ANYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY HELP MITIGATE THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS.
I'M NOT EVEN SAYING GUN CONTROL WOULD DO IT.
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT SHOWS THIS COUNTRY'S PROBLEM-SOLVING MECHANISM IS NOT
IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED?
>> SHOULD COSTUMES BE BANNED FROM MOVIE THEATERS?
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, DIDN'T REALIZE...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
