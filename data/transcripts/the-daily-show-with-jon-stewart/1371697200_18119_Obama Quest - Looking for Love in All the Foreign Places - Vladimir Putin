NAME.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW LUCKILY, LUCKILY THERE IS
ONE COUNTRY THAT AMERICA'S
ACTUALLY DEVELOPED GREAT
RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE YEARS,
RUSSIA.
YES, RUSSIA.
SINCE THE COLD WAR ENDED, RUSSIA
AND THE U.S. ALWAYS HAVE FUN
WHENEVER THEY GET TOGETHER.
REMEMBER GEORGE W. BUSH HANGING
OUT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN ZOOMS
AROUND IN VINTAGE CARS?
OR BILL CLINTON AND BORIS
YELTSIN AFTER WHAT I CAN ONLY
IMAGINE WAS A HEAVY LIQUID LUNCH
TOGETHER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> (CLINTONING LAUGHING)
>> John: PRESIDENT CLINTON
LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON THAT
DAY: NEVER GO TOE TO TOE ON
VODKA SHOTS WITH A MAN NAMED
BORIS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO MAYBE SOME FACE TIME WITH
PUTIN IS JUST WHAT OBAMA NEEDS
TO FEEL LOVED AGAIN.
RESPECTED.
CHERISHED.
APPRECIATED.
>> THIS PICTURE TAKEN JUST AFTER
THOSE TALKS BROKE UP SUGGESTED
OTHER ADJECTIVES: AWKWARD,
TENSE, COLD, INDIFFERENT.
>> John: INCOMMODIOUS, MALL
ADROIT, STUCK IN A LOVELESS
MARRIAGE.
HEMORRHOIDAL.
LIKE THEY JUST FOUND OUT WHO WAS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT GLORY
HOLE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE, LIGHTEN
THE MOOD.
SPRINKLE A LITTLE MAGIC CLINTON
GIGGLE DUST IN THERE.
>> WE COMPARED NOTES ON
PRESIDENT PUTIN'S EXPERTISE IN
JUDO AND MY DECLINING SKILLS IN
BASKETBALL.
WE BOTH AGREED THAT AS YOU GET
OLDER IT TAKES MORE TIME TO
RECOVER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> John: AMERICAN PRESIDENT
MAKES HUMOR TO BREAK TENSION BUT
I STATE UNDERLYING SUBTEXT TO
DEFLATE HIM.
WOW!
NOW, LOOK, A CERTAIN FROSTINESS
BETWEEN THEM MAKES SENSE.
I UNDERSTAND THESE TWO HAVE
DIFFERING OPINIONS ON WHAT TO DO
WITH THE SITUATION IN SYRIA, BUT
EVEN THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE
CHILL IN THAT ROOM.
THERE IS SOMETHING WEIRD GOING
ON IN THERE.
WHAT COULD IT BE?
>> DID RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
VLADIMIR PUTIN STEAL A SUPERBOWL
BOWL RING FROM NEW ENGLAND
PATRIOTS OWNER ROBERT KRAFT?
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> John: NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THAT BECAUSE
THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING I
HAVE THAT EVER HEARD.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE AMAZING IF
THAT HYPOTHETICALLY HAPPENED, IF
THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT STOLE A
SUPER BOWL RING FROM THE NEW
ENGLAND PATRIOTS.
BUT HOW WOULD THAT EVEN HAPPEN?
>> AT A HIGH-PROFILE BUSINESS
CONFERENCE EIGHT YEARS AGO IN
RUSSIA, KRAFT DID HAND THE RING
OVER AND PUTIN NEVER HANDED IT
BACK.
>> John: OH, OH, LET'S BE
FAIR.
LET'S BE FAIR.
HOW CAN YOU BE ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT IT WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN.
>> "I TOOK OUT THE RING AND
SHOWED IT TO PUTIN AND HE PUT IT
ON AND GOES I CAN KILL SOMEONE
WITH THIS RING."
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> John: YEAH, THAT WAS HIM.
OKAY, IT WAS DEFINITELY HIM.
THAT STORY EMPHATICALLY CHECKS
OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO LET'S RECAP THIS AMAZING
INCIDENT.
PUTIN SAYS HE LIKES THE RING,
SAYS HE CAN KILL SOMEONE WITH IT
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
>> HE PUT IN THE HIS POCKET AND
THREE K.G.B. GUYS GOT AROUND HIM
AND WALKED OUT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> John: WHAT?
IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME!
SORRY, DID I SAY "PERFECT"?
I MEANT BALLSIEST.
PUTIN IS NOT ONLY A NUCLEAR
ARMED TYRANT HE'S ALSO THE
WORLD'S LAZIEST JEWEL THIEF.
THERE'S ONE OTHER THING ABOUT
THAT PHOTO.
IF YOU'VE SEEN VIDEO OF VLADIMIR
PUTIN YOU KNOW THAT HE'S NOT THE
MAN GIVEN TO EXTRAVAGANT
EMOTION.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.
IN THIS CASE HE'S HANG GLIDING
AND HIS EXPRESSION SAYS "BEING
AN EAGLE BORES ME."
(LAUGHTER)
NOW LOOK AT HIM STEALING THE
RING.
LOOK AT HIS FACE!
LOOK AT HIS FACE!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS LITERALLY THE HAPPIEST
EVER I HAVE SEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN!
THAT RING MADE HIM SO HAPPY!
OH, MY GOD!
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO RECAPTURE
THE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM THAT
HE'S LOST AND HARNESS THE POWER
OF THE OFFICE NECESSARY TO FACE
DOWN AMERICA'S GREATEST
CHALLENGES OVER THE NEXT FEW
YEARS THERE IS ONE THING HE MUST
DO.
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU MUST SEEK THE
RINK!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU MUST FIND THE PRECIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL!
ONE RING!
AND MR. PRESIDENT, LOOK AT ME!
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT LET JOE
BIDEN PUT THAT RING ON HIS
FINGER!
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
