GROUNDHOG.
WE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH OUR
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE "MESS
O' SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT O'
POTAMIA"
( LAUGHTER )
AFTER SIX DAYS OF PEACEFUL
PROTESTS IN EGYPT, 30-YEAR
PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK FINALLY
TOOK TO THE AIRWAVES ON TUESDAY
NIGHT.
>> I WAS NEVER, EVER INTERESTED
IN BEING A DICTATOR.
>> Jon:  I JUST KNEW AS A
CHILD I WANT THE TO OPPRESS
PEOPLE.
BUT I DIDN'T MAYBE BE AN
ASSISTANT MANAGER NOBODY LIKES,
AN UNREASONABLY STRICT TEACHER.
BUT TO BE HERE ( BLEEP ) OVER
YOU PEOPLE, IT'S A DREAM COME
TRUE.
( LAUGHTER )
WAIT, WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT
AGAIN?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
( LAUGHTER )
HOSE ME, ARE YOU STAYING OR ARE
YOU GOING?
>> I TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, AND
REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT
CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT I DID NOT
INTEND TO RUN FOR A NEW
PRESIDENTIAL TERM BECAUSE I HAVE
SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN MY LIFE
SERVING EGYPT AND ITS PEOPLE.
>> Jon:  EGYPT, YOU CAN'T
FIRE ME, I QUIT BECAUSE YOU'RE A
BUNCH OF STUPIDHEADS.
STUPID.
( LAUGHTER )
THE TAKEAWAY IS, HE'S LEAVING.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HEARD.
THEY CAN ALL HEAD BACK TO THEIR
LIVES, THE NEW MUBARAK-LESS
CABINET BEGIN THE DEMOCRATIC
REFORM PROGRESS.
>> ( translated ):  I WILL
CONTINUE TO SUPERVISE THE NEW
GOVERNMENT
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU'VE NOT SEEN
THIS MOVIE, HAVE YOU?
THIS IS NOT THE PART WHERE YOU
STAY.
THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU TAKE
A BUNCH OF GOLD BRICKS, MAYBE A
PRICELESS ARTIFACT, AND HOP A
PLANE TO DUBAI.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD.
>> YOU HAVE NOW PEOPLE ON THE
FRONT LINES OF BOTH SIDES
THROWING ROCKS, THROWING
BOTTLES.
>> AS NIGHT FELL, WE STARTED
HEARING HEAVY GUNFIRE.
>> INCENDIARY DEVICES BEING
LAUNCHED OFF THE TOP OF THAT
BUILDING.
THAT IS A VERY OMINOUS FEELING.
>> STAMPEDING AND ATTACKING SOME
OF THE ANTI-MUBARAK PROTESTERS,
ON CAM EXPEL HORSEBACK.
>> Jon:  I CAN'T HELP BUT
NOTICE THE PRO-MUBARAK
DEMONSTRATORS SEEM TO BE
SLIGHTLY MORE ORGANIZED AND
ARMED AND HAVE HORSES
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT A SPONTANEOUS ERUPTION OF
PRO-MUBARAK SENTIMENT FROM EMPED
EGYPTIANS TRAINED IN THE ART OF
WHIP-BASED CROWD CONTROL
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T LIKE WHERE THIS IS
GOING.
>> WE WERE SET UPON BY
PRO-MUBARAK SUPPORTERS PUNCHING
US IN THE HEAD.
THE CROWD GET THROWING MORE
PUNCHES, KICKS.
SUDDENLY A YOUNG MAN WOULD COME
UP, LOOK AT YOU, AND THEN PUNCH
YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, HOSNI,
NOW YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.
HANDS OFF ANDERSON COOPER.
THERE IS NOT TO BE A CIVILRY
WISP OUT OF PLACE ON THAT MAN'S
GLORIOUS HEAD!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON, THERE
IS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO IS
ALLOWED TO PHYSICALLY ASSAULT
ANDERSON COOPER.
>> HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I PUNCHED
YOU?
>> IT'S LIKE THE SIXTH TIME
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  AND EVEN SHE IS
GRANTED THE HONOR BUT
