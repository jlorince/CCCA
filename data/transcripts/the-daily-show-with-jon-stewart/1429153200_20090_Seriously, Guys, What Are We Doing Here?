INVENTOR OF CRYSTAL PEPSI ANDCRYSTAL METH, BILLY CRYSTAL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SOMEBODY WHISTLEDFOR CRYSTAL METH.
( WHISTLING ) AND DID IT AGAIN.
ANYWAY, TONIGHT WE THOUGHT WE'DCHECK IN WITH OUR OLD PALS THE
TELEVISION NEWS MEDIA IN A NEWSEGMENT WE CALL SERIOUSLY, GUYS,
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OFONE HILLARY DENNIS RODMAN
CLINTON IS BUT TWO DAYSOLD-- TWO DAYS OLD!
AND ALREADY THE REPORTERSASSIGNED TO HER HAVE REPEATEDLY
COVERED THEMSELVES IN LET'S CALLIT GLORY.
FROM MONDAY'S CHIPOTLETEX MEX ERECTION,
TO TUESDAY'S, OH, MY GOD,OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD,
THAT'S HER CAR!
>> YOU CAN SEE THE MEDIA RUNNINGBEHIND ME HERE.
TO CHASE THE SCOOBY VAN.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  YOU CAN'T BLAMETHEM FOR CHASING THE SCOOBY VAN
BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE SCOOBYSNACKS. LIKE WOW!
( LAUGHTER )BUT GO ON.
>> WOW.
>> AND SHE'S GOING AROUND TO THEBACK.
>> WOW, THEY'RE-->> ALL RIGHT, AND WE'LL SEE
HER-- WE'LL SEE HER VERY SOON.
>> GUY IN THE ORANGE PANTS ISPRETTY QUICK.
ALEX, I MEAN, I'M LOOKING ATTHESE PEOPLE-- WOW!
ORANGE PANTS HE'S REALLYOUTNUMBERED NOW BY ALL OF THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE RACING AROUNDTHE BACK.
>> Jon:  HEY.
ORANGE PANTS HAS A NAME.
( LAUGHTER )HE'S A PERSON.
HIS NAME IS-- OH, THIS ISINTERESTING-- PHIL ORANGOPONG.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRONOUNCINGTHAT CORRECTLY.
HOLY ( BLEEP )!
WHAT, THEY'RE RACING TO HER CAR?
LAST TIME ANYONE IN IOWA WASTHIS EXCITED ABOUT A WHEELED
VEHICLE, THE WELLS FARGO WAGONWAS BRINGING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
THEY'D ORDERED FROM ACHARISMATIC STRANGER.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT GUY?
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, PEOPLE!
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD REASONSFOR YOU TO BE CHASING A VAN, IF
THE VAN WAS PERHAPS THE GOODHUMOR TRUCK, AND YOU WERE FIVE.
( LAUGHTER )IF ZAYN WAS IN THE VAN.
AND YOU WERE FIVE.
OR IF YOU'RE NOT SO MUCH RUNNINGTOWARDS THE VAN AS AWAY FROM
GODZILLA.
WHO, MORE THAN LIKELY, WOULD BECHASING YOU SAYING IT'S DAY TWO,
PEOPLE!
SLOW DOWN!
BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE REASON NOTWORTH CHASING HILLARY CLINTON'S
VAN.
YOUR REASON.
BECAUSE LET'S SAY YOU CATCH THECLINTON MOBILE.
BEST CASE, YOU'RE GETTING A FEWSECONDS OF FOOTAGE OF CLINTON
LEAVING THE CAR, AND GOING INTOA BUILDING.
WHICH REALLY ISN'T THATRELEVANT.
UNLESS YOU'RE REPORTING FORENTRANCE AND EXITS CHANNEL.
THE ENTRANCE AND EXITS CHANNEL.
YOU'LL FIND US HERE, HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )OF COURSE, BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET HER,LIKE-- NOW, THE PRIMARY ROLE OF
THE MEDIA ISN'T JUST TO CHASEPOLITICIANS ACROSS OFFICE PARKS.
IT'S ALSO TO EXPOSE ANDILLUMINATE THE ISSUES OF THE DAY
AND THAT'S WHEN IT'S TRULYIMPORTANT TO DO A GOOD JOB.
THEY DO DO WELL IN THOSEINSTANCES.
FOR INSTANCE, COVERING A SERIESOF INCIDENTS WHERE POLICE
OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED ONVIDEO KILLING UNARMED SUSPECTS.
NOW ADMITTEDLY FOOTAGE LIKE THISPUTS THE MEDIA IN A DIFFICULT
SPOT: HOW DO THEY SHOWUS SOMETHING THAT IS GENUINELY
NEWSWORTHY BUT THAT NOBODYWANTS TO LOOK AT?
OFTEN THEY GO THE PREEMPTIVEWARNING ROUTE.
>> A WARNING-- SOME VIEWERS MAYFIND THE GRAPHIC IMAGES
DISTURBING TO WATCH.
>> I WANT WARN YOU THAT THEVIDEO MAY BE DISTURBING TO
SOME VIEWERS.
>> THE VIDEO IS GRAPHIC.
>> MY APOLOGY.
I SHOULD HAVE WARNED THE VIEWERSTHAT THAT IS A GRAPHIC PIECE OF
VIDEO.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT,CLOSE ENOUGH.
LATE WARNING IS STILL A WARNINGAS OPPOSED TO SAY SPRINGING
TRAGIC FOOTAGE ON PEOPLE AS ANEYE-CATCHING TEASER AT LET'S
CALL IT THE CRACK OF-- WHOA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> GOOD MORNING.
MURDER.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU ( BLEEP )KIDDING ME?
( LAUGHTER )IT'S 7:00 A.M.
I'M MAKING OATMEAL, YOU OPEN THE"TODAY SHOW" WITH
"GOOD MORNING," AND THE VIDEO OFAN ACTUAL MURDER.
HOW'S THE CROWD OUTSIDE GOING TOTAKE THAT ON THE PLAZA?
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
AND UP LATER, RASCAL FLATTS ONTHE PLAZA, AND AL ROKER
DECAPITATES A HAMPSTER.
LOOK, I GET IT.
TELEVISION IS A VISUAL MEDIUM.
AND YOU'RE USED TO JAZZING UPSTORIES WITH EXCITING FOOTAGE OR
B-ROLL AS THEY CALL IT, WHETHERIT BE EXTREME COLD OR EXTREME
HOTNESS.
BUT THAT'S NOT OKAY TO DO WITHACTUAL DEATH.
YOU CAN SHOW THE FOOTAGE TOEDUCATE PEOPLE.
YOU CAN SHOW IT TO ANALYZE WHATHAPPENED FOR FURTHER CONTEXT OR
INSIGHT.
BUT AT SOME POINT, IN ALMOST ALLTHESE STORIES, THE 24-HOUR NEWS
NETWORKS SHIFT THESE DEVASTATINGVIDEOS INTO SCREEN SAVER MODE,
AND THEY END UP JUST RUNNING ASBACKGROUND WALLPAPER TO YOUR
DISCUSSION.
SOMETIMES IT'S THE WHOLE( BLEEP ) WALL.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR MONTHSNOW.
NEWS SHOWS WERE LOOPING THE ERICGARNER CHOKING FOOTAGE LIKE IT
WAS A GIF ON A BUZZFEED LIST.
AND I ASSUME THE BUZZFEEDARTICLE WOULD BE THE TEN
FUNNIEST KITTEN GIFS ONTHE INTERNET STILL WON'T
ERASE THE PAIN OF THIS POLICEBRUTALITY GIF.
YOU HAVE THE WEIRDEST SENSE OFMORALITY I'VE EVER SEEN.
( APPLAUSE )IN AN AUDIENCE.
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
I DON'T MIND SEEING THE VIDEOSOVER AND OVER AGAIN, BUT WHEN
YOU MAKE FUN OF BUZZFEED, IGOTTA STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND.
( LAUGHTER )YOU KNOW, MY FATHER WAS KILLED
BY A LISTICLE.
LISTEN, NEWS MEDIA, TURNING THELAST MOMENTS OF SOMEONE'S LIFE
INTO NEWZAK THAT JUST PLAYS INTHE BACKGROUND OF DISCUSSIONS
SLOWLY ROBS THOSE IMAGESOF THEIR POWER AND MORE
IMPORTANTLY THE PEOPLEIN THE VIDEOS OF THEIR HUMANITY.
AND WE GOT TO NIP THIS TREND INTHE BUD BECAUSE
UNLIKE BLOCKBUSTER THESE TYPESOF VIDEOS AIN'T GOING AWAY.
THE UBIQUITY OF CELL PHONES ISFAR OUTPACING POLICE AWARENESS
OF THE UBIQUITY OF CELL PHONES.
IN FACT, CNN HAS GOTTEN -- NOWTHEY'RE BACK --
( APPLAUSE )CNN'S GOTTEN SO CASUAL WITH
THEIR POLICE BRUTALITY FOOTAGE,THEY RAN ASSORTED KILLINGS AS
LOWER-THIRD VIDEO TICKER FARE, AHALLOWED SPACE NORMALLY RESERVED
FOR SUCH TICKER-WORTHY ITEMSAS TORI SPELLING BURNS SELF ON
HIBACHI AND IS TAPWATER MAKING YOU FAT?
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THEWRONG IDEA ABOUT THE NEWS MEDIA.
IT MAY SEEM LIKE I'VE MADE ITLOOK LIKE THEY'RE JUST PLUGGING
ELEMENTS INTO A PREORDAINEDFORMAT AND LOSING SIGHT OF
ANY EDITORIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME LINESTHAT THEY SIMPLY WILL NOT CROSS.
>> I'M LOSING MY BREATH.>> ( BLEEP ) YOUR BREATH.
>> ANOTHER OFFICER RESPONDS, "F"YOUR BREATH.
>> "F" YOUR BREATH. SHUT THE "F"UP?
IS THIS THE KIND OF LANGUAGETHAT OFFICERS USE?
>> Jon:  YEAH, IT'SOUTRAGEOUS. YEAH.
YOU HAVE NAILED THE REALOUTRAGE.
WHAT'S IT LIKE IN CNN'SSTANDARDS AND PRACTICES
DEPARTMENT?
HEY, WE CAN'T SAY ( BLEEP ) ONTHE AIR.
KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING.
AND RERACK THAT SHOOTINGFOOTAGE.
KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING.
( LAUGHTER )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
