[ LAUGHTER ]
DID I MENTION WE'RE BACK FROM VACATION?
LAST NIGHT AROUND 10:00 PUT THE KIDS TO BED AND I'M WATCHING, AS I ALWAYS DO AT THIS TIME THE
LAWRENCE O'DONNELL SHOW BECAUSE THAT'S THE PREMISES OF THE BIT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO.
ANYHOO MR. O'DON'T IS SUPPOSED TO INTERVIEW CRAIG SONNER THE
LAWYER AT THE CENTER OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN CASE.
>> GEORGE SONNER THE COURAGEOUS DEFENDER OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WALKED OUT OF STUDIO.
THERE IS HIS CHAIR IN ORLANDO.
>> NOT THE MOST ENTHRALLING TELEVISION BUT IT'S MISS NEEB.
I DIDN'T THINK DRESSING A GRIZZLY BEAR IN HUMAN CLOTHES OF A GOOD IDEA BUT YOU KNOW THEY
MADE THAT WORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PANDA, WHAT NO?
[ LAUGHTER ]
ANYWAY HAVE IT IT.
WHO IS PAGE YOU, MR. LAWYER?
WHO HIRED YOU?
WHEN EXACTLY DID THEY HIRE YOU?
DOES GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAVE A JOB?
DOES HE HAVE ANY PROPERTY?
DID YOU REPRESENT HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT ON A POLICE OFFICER?
DO YOU HAVE THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT YOU CAN SHOW US?
>> HE'S GRILLING THE CHAIR!
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, THE CHAIR DOESN'T HAVE MEDICAL RECORDS TO SHOW YOU.
IT'S A CHAIR.
YOU SHOULD BE YELLING AT THE FILING CABINET.
NOTE TO SELF, DO NOT GO TO IKEA WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A FARALOGGIN YOU ARE NO MORE A GARFUNG -- I LIVE IN NEW YORK
CITY I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE YELLING AT CHAIRS.
NONE OF THEM HAVE TV SHOWS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AFTER WATCHING THIS P FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES I STARTED FEELING BADLY FOR THE CHAIR.
TONIGHT WE HAVE THE CHAIR'S LAWYER WHO WAS WITH HIM DURING THE INTERVIEW.
WE HAVE FAN WITH US.
HELLO FAN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I KNOW YOU ARE BUSY THIS TIME OF YEAR IN FLORIDA FLM IT'S IN BETWEEN SPRING AND SUMMER,
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO USE THEIR AIR CONDITIONING.
ALL RIGHT.
EVEN I CAN'T SUSTAIN THIS BIT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER WAY WE WERE GOING TO GO THIS WITH BECAUSE WE WERE SO EXCITED WHEN WE SAW HIM
YELLING AT THE CHAIR?
WE CAME UP WITH TWO IDEAS FOR THE BIT.
THE OTHER PREMISE WAS SIMPLY ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER THERE WAS THE WHOLE TINY HE IS JUST TIEN.
DID YOU REPRESENT HIM THEN.
>> I'M RIGHT HERE.
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TALK YOU POMPOUS SON OF A (bleep).
I'M OUT OF HERE.
>> Jon: NOT JUST THAT WAS IGNORED BUT AFTER HE BAILED ON THE INTERVIEW IT TOOK HIM 20
MINUTES TO WALK ACROSS THE CHAIR.
I'M SORRY.
