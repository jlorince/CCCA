♪♪
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HELLO!
>> HELLO.
>> Jon: I GREET YOU.
ALWAYS GET A QUICK I LOVE YOUBEFORE YOU COME ON.
(LAUGHTER)
"BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME." WHATA POWERFUL WORK.
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S REALLY A WONDERFUL,CHALLENGING READ.
YOU WROTE THIS AS A LETTER TOYOUR SON.
>> I DID, BUT NOW I HAVE TOBREAK EVERYBODY'S HEART.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A LITERARYCONVENTION.
I WAS WORKING ON THE BOOK.
>>  I'M SORRY.>> Jon: I'M GONNA GO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NOTHING ABOUT MY SON IS GOINGTO BE A REVELATION IN THIS BOOK.
THIS IS HOW WE TALK.
>> Jon: ALL THE TIME?
YEAH, THERE IS NOTHING NEW INHERE FOR HIM.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: MAKES ME FEEL BETTER --
HOW OLD IS YOUR SON?
>> HE'S 14, AND HE'LL BE 15 NEXTMONTH.
>> Jon: AS A FATHER, THE IDEAYOU THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO
COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR SON WASTHROUGH A BOOK --
>> RIGHT!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: -- HAD ME VERYNERVOUS ABOUT MY CHILDREN.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: I WOULD HAVE TO BECOMEAN AVATAR IN A MIND CRAFT GAME
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
(LAUGHTER)
WHEN DID YOU START?
BECAUSE  I THINK WHAT ISREVELATORY ABOUT THIS --
ABOUT THIS READING FOR ME IS THEUNDERLYING FEELING OF FEAR THAT
YOU EXPRESS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK,FEAR FOR YOURSELF GROWING UP IN
BALTIMORE, FEAR FOR YOUR SON,FEAR FOR OTHER MEN, OTHER
PEOPLE OF COLOR.
>> YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH TOTELL WHEN YOU BEGIN A BOOK LIKE
THIS, BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE THAT ITACTUALLY REACHES BACK TO MY
EARLIEST MEMORIES, BUT IF I HADTO SAY AT THE BEGINNING, IT
WOULD BE THE MURDER OF MY GOODFRIEND PRINCE JONES.
WHO WENT TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY.
HE WAS TRAILED THROUGH THREEJURISDICTIONS BY A POLICE
OFFICER WHO MISTOOK HIM FORSOMEBODY ELSE AND SHOT HIM DOWN.
THAT WAS HORRIFIC.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE MADE MY PEACE WITH IT, OR THAT HIS
FAMILY HAVE MADE THEIR PEACEWITH IT.
WRITING IS SOMETHING THAT WE DOTO DO THAT, TO TRY TO MAKE
SENSE OF IT.
THAT WAS 15 YEARS AGO, THAT WASTHE BEGINNING.
I HAVE BEEN CARRYING IT WITH MEEVER SINCE.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT IT WASINTERESTING.
IT'S NOT REVEALED UNTIL LATER ONIN THE BOOK, AND WHEN IT COMES
OUT, IT'S DEVASTATING TO BEGINWITH, BUT WHAT A DEVASTATING
BLOW FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THATYOU HAD SET UP FOUNDATIONALLY UP
TO THAT POINT.
>> RIGHT.
ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS IS,ONE OF THE THINGS WE TELL
OURSELVES AS AFRICAN-AMERICANSIS IF WE WORK HARD, PLAY BY THE
RULES, WE START BACK A LITTLEWAYS, BUT IF WE START, WE CAN
BE TWICE AS GOOD.
SOMEHOW WE CAN ESCAPE HISTORYAND HERITAGE AND LEGACY.
AND PRINCE'S MOTHER MABEL JONESIS A WOMAN FROM OPELOUSAS,
LOUISIANA, BORN IN POVERTY,CHILD OF SHARECROPPERS, WORKED
HER WAY UP.
BECAME A RADIOLOGIST, WENT TOL.S.U., SERVED IN THE NAVY,
ACQUIRED THINGS, DID EVERYTHINGYOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO --
AND HE SON WAS KILLED. HER SONWAS KILLED, JUST LIKE TAMIR RICE
WAS KILLED.
THERE'S NO REAL DIFFERENCE --
>> Jon: AND SHE TALKS ABOUT IT.
SHE SAYS HE HAD A LIFE OFPRIVLEGE.
THEY DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS,THEY DID -- AND SHE TALKS ABOUT
IT'S ALL GONE IN ONE RACISTMOMENT.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT.
THE REALLY SAD THING THAT SHEREVEALS IS THE FACT, THEY WERE
CHASING ANOTHER CRIMINAL DRIVINGA JEEP.
>> Jon: WHO WAS 5'4".
>> AND I THINK PRINCE WAS 6'4",NO PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCE EXCEPT
THEY WERE BOTH BLACK.
THAT WAS THE ONLT THING, THAT --SHE HAD BOUGHT HIM THIS CAR,
THEY RAN THE TAGS, THE TAGS CAMEBACK IT TO HER IN PENNSYLVANIA.
THEY THOUGHT THAT HE COULD'VEPOSSIBLY STOLEN THE JEEP.
IT NEVER OCCURED TO THEM THATSOMBODY ELSE, HIS MOTHER HAD
BOUGHT IT.
THEY TRAILED HIM LIKE ACRIMINAL.
IT'S VERY SAD.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK IT'SSO DIFFICULT WHEN YOU BRING THIS
UP AS YOUR EXPERIENCE, AS THEEXPERIENCE OF A COMMUNITY, THAT
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEWHITE COMMUNITY, THE POWER
STRUCTURE IN PLACE, TO NOT GETANGRY ABOUT THAT?
WHY IS IT SUCH A HARDCONVERSATION TO HAVE?
>> BECAUSE IT INSULTS MANY OFOUR DEEPEST NOTIONS.
IF YOU ACCEPT, AS I ARGUE INTHIS BOOK, THE IDEA ITHAT THE
PLUNDER OF BLACK COMMUNITIES ISNOT A BUMP ALONG THE ROAD, BUT
IS, IN FACT, THE ROAD ITSELF,THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE IN AMERICA
WITHOUT SLAVERY AND JIM CROW ANDEVERYTHING ABOUT TERRORISM AND
EVERYTHING THAT CAME AFTER THAT.
IT MAKES IT VERY, VERY HARDTO PREACH TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND
SAY, LISTEN, WE ARE THEUNBESMIRCHED LAND OF THE FREE.
WE ARE THE CITY, YOU KNOW, THESHINING CITY ON A HILL.
IT REVEALS US TO BE NOTNECESSARILY WORSE THAN OTHER
COUNTRIES, BUT QUITE MORTAL.
>> Jon: AND NOT EXCEPTIONAL.
>> NOT EXCEPTIONAL. THAT'SEXACTLY IT.
>> Jon: AND THERE IS ADISCONNECT BETWEEN DIRECT
RESPONSIBILITY AND MALEVOLENCEAND IGNORANCE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND IGNORANCE IS THEHARDEST PART BECAUSE EMPATHY,
UNDERSTANDING WHAT PEOPLE AREGOING THROUGH, IS THE HARDEST
THING, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHOTHINK, HOW DO I HAVE PRIVILEGE
WHEN MY LIFE IS HARD.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS I'MGOING THROUGH-- I CAN'T SAY I'VE
FIGURED THIS OUT -- HOW MUCH OFIGNORANCE IS WILLFUL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S NOT HARD TO KNOW WHATTHE CONFEDERATE FLAG MEANT.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, THEY SAID IT. THEY SAIDIT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S, LIKE, TRYING TO NOT KNOW-- I'M NOT SURE YET -- THAT'S
THE THING I WONDER A LOT ABOUT.
>> Jon: YOU GET CRITICIZEDBECAUSE THEY SAY YOU'RE MORE
MALCOLM THAN MARTIN.
THAT YOU IDENTIFY BY A LITTLEBIT IN THAT WAY.
IT'S NOT AS OPTOMISTIC FOR YOU,YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FEELING THAT
MAYBE THE ARC OF HISTORY IS LONGBUT IT BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE.
>> I DON'T.
I THINK IT BENDS TOWARDS CHAOS.
I THINK, I THINK THE RECORD OFHISTORY IS ACTUALLY BEHIND ME.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ARCS,IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESPECT EVERY
INDIVIDUAL'S ARC.
IF YOU WERE WITH SOMEONE WHOWAS KILLED IN AUSCHWITZ, THAT'S
THE END OF YOUR ARC.
THAT'S DEVASTING AND THAT'STRAGIC AND WE SHOULD NOT MAKE
OURSELVES FEEL BETTER ABOUTTHAT.
WHEN ARGON WAS CHOKED TO DEATH,HIS LIFE ENDED.
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T TAKETHINGS FROM IT AND BE INSPIRED,
BUT WE SHOULD NOT TRY TO MAKEOURSELVES FEEL BETTER ABOUT
THAT.
WE SHOULD SIT WITH THE PAIN.
>> Jon: I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOUMORE ABOUT THAT.
ITS INTERESTING WHEN YOU TALKABOUT NOT COMFORTING YORU SON
AFTER THAT, SO CAN YOU STICKAROUNG?
>> YES.
>> Jon: VERY GOOD.
"BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME," ONTHE SHELVES NOW.
IT REALLY IS A MUST-READ.
TA-NEHISI COATES.
WE'LL COME RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
