>> Jon: I DO. LET ME TELL YOUSOMETHING --
>> YOU'RE A CANDIDATEFOR A LIZARD BEATING.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO. LET ME --
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE GREATPEOPLE OF FLORIDA.
THEY -- WHAT A WONDERFUL SENSEOF HUMOR.
I'M HONESTLY COUNTING ON THEDEMOGRAPHIC BEING SO OLD THAT BY
THE TIME I GET DOWN THERE -->> YEAH.
>> Jon: LISTEN TO THIS.LISTEN TO THIS.
LET'S START WITH AGREEMENT.LET'S START WITH AGREEMENT.
>> COULD I HAVE SOME WATER?
>> Jon: PLEASE HAVE -- OHPLEASE.
COME ON.
I KNOW YOU'RE A THIRSTY MAN.(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, MARCO RUBIO, LET'SLOOK AT THIS.
WE'LL START WITH AN AGREEMENT.
YOU LOOK VERY FIT. YOU, YOU --
>> IT'S PHOTOSHOPPED.
>> Jon: IS THAT PHOTOSHOPPED?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IS IT REALLY?
>> WELL, AND I STOPPED EATINGROACHES ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,
SO I'VE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT,YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE A WONDERFULSTATE.
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVEFUN WITH THAT.
THAT'S ALL THAT WAS. LET ME --LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS,
YOU -- YOU WANT TO RESTOREECONOMIC --
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A FLORIDAGRAPHIC UP, DO YOU?
>> Jon: NO. NOT RIGHT NOW.
IT REALLY DOES -- I MEAN, IT ISA --
>> NO, NO PLEASE. LET'SCONTINUE.
I HAVE A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED--
>> Jon: YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: "AMERICAN DREAMS,"RESTORING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.
BUT THEN THERE'S A VERYINTERESTING PHRASE AT THE END OF
IT "FOR EVERYONE."
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: EXPLAIN THAT.
>> WELL, FOR EVERYONE.
>> Jon: WELL, IN THIS COUNTRY,WE GENERALLY LIKE TO KEEP THE
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY SEPARATE -->> YEAH.
>> Jon: FOR PEOPLE THATALREADY HAVE MONEY.
SO THE IDEA OF RESTORING IT FOREVERYBODY, THIS IS AN EXCITING
IDEA.
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
LISTEN, I THINK WHAT WE'VETALKED ABOUT IN THE BOOK THAT
HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE.>> Jon: YES.
MY DAD WAS A BARTENDER -->> Jon: YES.
>> IN FLORIDA FOR MANY YEARS.ALSO IN LAS VEGAS.
MY MOM WAS A MAID.AND THEY WERE NEVER RICH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NEVER MADE A LOT OF MONEY --WE NEVER, YOU KNOW, THEY HAD
A HOME IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOODBUT WERE NEVER WEALTHY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YET DESPITE THE FACT THEYHAD LIMITED EDUCATION,
THEY LIVED HERE AT ATIME WHERE SOMEONE LIKE
THEM COULD MAKE IT TO THEMIDDLE CLASS.
I THINK THAT'S GOTTEN NEARLYIMPOSSIBLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE REALLY FEELLIKE THEY OPEN UP THE PAPER, SAY
OH THE ECONOMY IS DOING GREATAND ALL THESE JOBS ARE BEING
CREATED. AND YET THEY DON'TFEEL IT IN THEIR OWN LIVES.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> THEY'RE A BROKEN DOWN CARAWAY FROM FEELING THERE'S A
DISASTER. AND SO THE QUESTIONIS WHOSE FAULT IS IT, RIGHT?
AND THE ANSWER IS THAT IT'S NOTJUST SOMEONE'S FAULT.
THERE IS AN ECONOMICRESTRUCTURING TAKING PLACE,
AND OUR POLICIES HAVE NOTADJUSTED TO IT.
THE 21st CENTURY ISDRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM
WHAT THE ECONOMY LOOKED LIKE 20YEARS AGO.
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT DON'T YOUTHINK SOME OF THE ECONOMIC
RESTRUCTURING HAS BEEN THAT THEMORE POWERFUL FIRMS HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO LOBBY CONGRESS ANDCREATE, YOU KNOW,
A DIFFERENT SET OF RULESFOR THEIR ECONOMIC STABILITY.
>> I THINK, I THINK THAT THEPEOPLE THAT, AND THERE ARE MANY
INSTANCES IN WHICH INDUSTRIES INTHE PAST --
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND I FELT THIS AS WELL WHENI WAS IN THE STATE
LEGISLATURE IN FLORIDA THAT -->> Jon: RIGHT.
YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW, AREN'TYOU?
>> I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU LAUGH.
NO, I LOVE LIVING THERE.WE HAVE NO INCOME TAX.
>> Jon: WHAT?>> YEAH.
>> Jon: OH.
>> YOU CAN MOVE DOWN THERE INSIX MONTHS AND A DAY.
>> Jon: YEAH, SURE, I'LL BERIGHT THERE.
I MEAN, WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUTTHE STATE WHEN THAT'S THE LURE.
>> NO STATE INCOME TAX?(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YEAH, I MEAN, YOURSELLING POINT IS, IT'S FREE!
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT'SLIKE, YOU KNOW, THE TUNNELS TO
GET INTO INTO NEW YORKCITY IS 12 BUCKS.
>> YEAH. SURE.>> Jon: TO GO TO JERSEY, FREE!
(APPLAUSE)THAT'S IS HOW IT IS!
>> YEAH, WELL, IT DOESN'T SNOW.IT DOESN'T SNOW.
>> Jon: I LIKE THAT.YOU SHOULD OPEN WITH THAT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THE FREE THING -- YOUSHOULD OPEN WITH THE SNOW THING.
>> THE SNOW THING. AND IT'SFREE.
>> Jon: BUT TELL ME ABOUT THIS.
>> ALL RIGHT, SO LOOK,  BUT, BUTTHE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> LOOK, SO ONE OF THE ARGUMENTSI'VE MADE AS WELL, BOTH IN THE
BOOK AND OUTSIDE OF IT,IS SOMETIMES ESTABLISHED
INDUSTRIES WILL USE POWER,REGULATIONS AND LAWS TO MAKE
SURE AN INNOVATIVE COMPETITORCAN'T ENTER THE SPACE.
>> Jon: YES.
>> AND ONE OF THE EXAMPLES I USEIN THE BOOK AND I HAD THIS
CONVERSATION WITH STUDENTS AT ACOURSE THAT I TEACH AT
FLORIDA INTERNATIONALUNIVERSITY.
THEY WERE COMPLAININGTHEY COULDN'T GET UBER IN MIAMI.
AND THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THELOCAL COMMISSION UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF THE MEDALLIONHOLDERS FOR THE TAXICABS
HAVE PRESSURED THE COMMISSIONNOT TO OPEN  IT UP FOR
A COMPETITOR, AN INNOVATIVECOMPETITOR TO ENTER THE SPACE.
THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF IT,BUT THE POINT IS, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I MEAN, SOMETIMES, OFTENTIMES,ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES WILL
USE THE MOUNTAIN OFREGULATIONS AND LAWS
TO KEEP COMPETITORS FROMENTERING THE MARKET.
>> Jon: OR CREATE NEW ONES THATARE DESIGNED TO KEEP THE BAR OF
ENTRY VERY HIGH SO THATCOMPANIES CAN'T BE AGILE.
>> WELL, AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TOGET INTO AN AREA OF CONTROVERSY
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVEDIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT IT.
BUT IN OBAMACARE ITSELF THERE'SAN EXAMPLE OF --
>> Jon: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUTTHE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT?
>> IN FLORIDA, WE CALL ITOBAMACARE.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S RIGHT? IDIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW.
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ALL RIGHT,I WASN'T SURE.
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE SAMELEGISLATION.
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS. OKAY, SOANYWAY, THE POINT IS
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD ABUSINESS WHERE WE COULD PASS A
LAW THAT SAID YOU HAVETO BUY THIS PRODUCT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU'RE FORCED TO BUYTHIS PRODUCT.
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY IT,WE'RE GOING TO SUBSIDIZE IT
FOR YOU.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND IF YOU LOSE MONEY,IF THE BUSINESS LOSES MONEY,
WE'RE GOING TO COME IN AND BAILYOU OUT.
>> Jon: SO IT WOULD BELIKE, LET'S SAY YOU MADE A
PRODUCT AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYSLIKE YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT
SEAT BELTS OR LIKE SOMETHINGSTUPID LIKE THAT.
>> WELL, THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETYTHING, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE PREVENTING PEOPLEFROM DYING IN CAR ACCIDENT.S
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO, YOU'RERIGHT. NO, NO, NO,
HEALTH INSURANCE IS NOT A PUBLICSAFETY THING. THAT'S A --
>> BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT.
NO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWODIFFERENT THINGS.
>> Jon: OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKINGABOUT?
>> WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS HOWTHE INSURANCE COMPANIES GAME THE
SYSTEM TO THEIR BENEFIT. THEYGET BAILED EVEN IF --
>> Jon: OH LISTEN, I AGREE WITHYOU ON THAT.
THIS IS CERTAINLY A BOON TO THEINSURANCE INDUSTRY.
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINKYOU'RE RIGHT THERE.
>> WE HAVE A SEAT BELT LAW INFLORIDA TOO, BY THE WAY.
>> Jon: I SAY DON'T WORRYABOUT IT.
(LAUGHTER)BUT WAIT. WHEN WE COME BACK,
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THERE ARE,THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING
PROGRAMS IN HERE THAT IACTUALLY THINK ARE REALLY
ACTUALLY REALLY GOODIDEAS, ONES THAT I AGREE WITH.
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSESPECIFICALLY.
>> BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAYTHAT PUBLICALLY.
>> Jon: NO, I'LL SAY IT RIGHTNOW ON THE TV.
>> OH, OH, OH OKAY.
>> AND THERE'S OVER LIKE100 PEOPLE WATCHING.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MOREFROM SENATOR MARCO RUBIO
RIGHT AFTER THIS
