>> Jon: YOU CAN GET ONE OFTHOSE CASHEWS GLAZED WITH
CRANBERRIES OR WHATEVERTHE HELL YOU'RE SELLING
IN THERE NOW. HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GREAT.
TODAY WAS A BIG DAY FORSTARBUCKS.
WE HAD A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> Jon: NOW, TELL ME ABOUT THEANNOUNCEMENT. I HEARD ABOUT IT,
BUT TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU'REDOING OVER THERE.
>> TODAY WE ANNOUNCED THATSTARBUCKS WOULD BECOME FIRST
U.S. COMPANY TO PROVIDE FREECOLLEGE TUITION FOR ALL OUR
EMPLOYEES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> Jon: IT IS MY JOB TO HATEEVERYTHING.
[LAUGHTER]I'M HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME
WITH THIS.
THIS SOUNDS LOVELY.
WHERE ARE YOU SENDING THEM?
[LAUGHTER]>> WELL, LET'S START FROM THE
BEGINNING.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
IS THIS GOING TO BE ABOUT YOUSTARTED WITH ONE SHOP IN
SEATTLE, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVETIME.
>> NO, NO.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> UNFORTUNATELY, COLLEGETUITION ENDEBTEDNESS IS
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
>> Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
>> THE AVERAGE COLLEGE STUDENTHAS $30,000 IN DEBT.
>> Jon: YEP.>> AND, WE'RE FALLING BEHIND.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.
SO, I THINK, WE CAN'T WAIT FORWASHINGTON.
WE'VE GOT TO STEP UP AS WE'VEDONE IN THE PAST AND DEMONSTRATE
TRUE LEADERSHIP.
SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO OUREMPLOYEES IS WE'RE GOING TO
PROVIDE YOU WITH SOMETHING YOUCAN'T GET ON YOUR OWN.
IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH ASU.
IT'S ONLINE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WEALL RECOGNIZE THAT.
AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, ANDYOU SPEAK ABOUT IT A LOT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE COUNTRY'S HAVING SERIOUSPROBLEMS.
PEOPLE ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND.
>> Jon: THIS COUNTRY?
HOW DARE YOU, SIR.
YOU'VE GOT SOME VENTI BALLS, MYFRIEND.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NOW, HOW DID YOU END UP DOING
IT WITH ASU?
I'VE HEARD THAT ONLINE ASU ISPARTY SCHOOL.
>> YOU HEARD THAT?WELL, THE TRUTH IS THAT
ASU HAS THE BESTONLINE PROGRAM OF ANY UNIVERSITY
IN THE COUNTRY.WE'VE DONE A LOT OF HOMEWORK.
>> Jon: DID YOU APPROACH, YOU
JUST APPROACHED THEM AND SAID,HEY, IF WE DO THIS WITH YOU,
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COST YOU,I READ SOMEWHERE, I THINK IT WAS
FORBES, IF 3% OF YOUR EMPLOYEESTAKE THIS OFFER UP, AND IT'S A
GOOD OFFER, IT'S $50 MILLION.
>> IT WILL BE MILLIONS OFDOLLARS PER YEAR, BUT I THINK
HERE'S THE THING: WE'RE A PUBLICCOMPANY.
WE HAVE TO BUILD LONG-TERM VALUEFOR THE SHAREHOLDER, BUT WE'VE
RECOGNIZED A LONG TIME AGO WHENWE PROVIDED HEALTH CARE FOR OUR
PEOPLE, OWNERSHIP AROUNDPEOPLE, THE ONLY
WAY TO BUILD A GREAT, ENDURINGCOMPANY IS BY LINKING
SHAREHOLDER VALUE WITH VALUE FOREMPLOYEES.
AND I THINK THIS IS ANOPPORTUNITY I THINK TO DO
SOMETHING THAT NO ONE'S DONEBEFORE, BUT ALSO...
>> Jon: BUT WHY IS IT THAT NOONE'S... IT SEEMS TO MAKE
PERFECT SENSE WHEN YOU TALKABOUT IT FROM A HUMAN...
YOU KNOW, CORPORATIONS AREPEOPLE, WE'VE LEARNED.
[LAUGHTER]BUT GENERALLY THEY'RE
SOCIOPATHS.
[LAUGHTER]WHY IS IT THAT YOUR CORPORATION
IS ABLE TO DO THIS AND TREATTHEM HUMANLY?
[APPLAUSE]BECAUSE LISTEN, THAT'S A TOUGH
GIG. WORKING AT STARBUCKS,YOU DO GET GOOD PEOPLE,
BUT THAT'S NOT AN EASY GIG FORPEOPLE.
IT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE.>> NO, IT'S NOW.
>>Jon: IT GETS BUSY AS HELL.
PEOPLE CAN BE VERY DEMANDING.
THESE ARE NOT EASY JOBS.
AND I IMAGINE RETENTION ISDIFFICULT.
>> WE HAVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OFATTRITION OF ANY COMPANY IN OUR
SECTOR, BUT I WANT TO JUST GOBACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID AND
WHY.
WHY AREN'T COMPANIES DOING MOREOF THIS?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THEREHAS BEEN A ZERO SUM GAME.
THAT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERSIS PROFITABILITY. AND WHAT I'M
SAYING, AND I THINK ALOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS,
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD, ANDTHAT IS YOU CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON
PROFITABILITY.
AND AN ENDURING, GREAT COMPANYHAS TO BE BASED ON MORE THAN
THAT. NOW, STARBUCKS IS APEOPLE-BASED COMPANY.
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS...
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT'SIN THE COFFEE?
I THOUGHT IT WAS A COFFEE-BASEDCOMPANY.
>> NO, WHAT I MEAN BY THAT,WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT OUR
PEOPLE HAVE CREATEDTHE EXPERIENCE.
>> Jon: OH, OKAY.
>> WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WECAN TO EXCEED THEIR
EXPECTATIONS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ACOLLEGE EDUCATION.
WE WANT TO PROVIDE IT. ANDTHE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOTPROVIDING PEOPLE --
>> Jon: RIGHT. ANYTHING.
>> -- AT LOWER LEVELS OF OURSOCIETY WITH THE THINGS THAT THE
PEOPLE WITH PRIVILEGE HAVE.AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT. AND WE CAN'T WAIT FORWASHINGTON.
>> Jon: WHAT IS, LET ME TO TALKTO YOU ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE AS
WELL, BECAUSE IN SEATTLE, WHEREYOU'RE BASED, THEY'RE
THE FIRST CITY TORAISE IT TO $15. RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Jon. SO, HAS THAT TAKENEFFECT?
>> NO. THAT HAS NOT, THAT HASNOT TAKEN EFFECT.
>> Jon: WHEN IT DOES, WILL ITRAIN CATS AND DOGS?
WILL DAY BE NIGHT?
WILL THE EARTH SPIN IN ANOPPOSITE DIRECTION?
BECAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,IF YOU PAY PEOPLE A WAGE THAT
ALLOWS THEM TO LIVE LIKE HUMANS,MEPHISTOPHELES RISES.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD. I DON'TKNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.
>> WELL, UH, HOW I DO ANSWERTHAT?
SEATTLE HAS APPROVED $15 ANHOUR.
IT'S GOT TO GO TO THE VOTERS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>>I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THERIGHT NUMBER OR NOT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> WE'LL FOLLOW THE LAW.
I THINK THERE WILL BE UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCES OF SMALL BUSINESSES
NOT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. THEISSUES IS THAT
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY AGOOD WAGE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO
PROVIDE TOTAL COMPENSATION. WHATI MEAN BY THAT
IS NOT ONLY COLLEGETUITION, OWNERSHIP, HEALTH CARE,
COMPANIES NEED DO MORE FOR THEIRPEOPLE.
THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TOBUILD...
>> WHAT DO OTHER COMPANIES SAYTO YOU THEN?
ARE THEY, ARE THEY ANGRY WITHYOU?
LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO, YOU KNOW,CORPORATE BRUNCH OR
WHATEVER HAPPENS, LIKE ARE THEGUYS FROM WAL-MART LIKE
THEY SEE YOU AND THEY'RELIKE, ARE THEY MAD?
>> I THINK STARBUCKS HAS ALWAYSTAKEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
TRACK TO BUILDING A COMPANY.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I THINK WE'VE TRIED TOEMBRACE HUMANITY AS A CORE
COMPETENCY.
AND I THINK MOST COMPANIES HAVENOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT.
BUT, HERE'S THE THING, BECAUSEOF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE FACT
THAT THERE'S SUCH TRANSPARENCY,THE CONSUMER TODAY KNOWS
EVERYTHING. AND THEY AREMAKING DECISIONS
NOT ONLY ON WHAT THINGS SELL ANDFEATURES AND BENEFITS,
BUT YOUR VALUES AND YOURSENSE OF PURPOSE.
AND IF YOU DON'T DO THE RIGHTTHING, THEY'RE GONNA REJECT YOU.
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK MOREPEOPLE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING.
>> WELL, I'M IMPRESSED BY IT.
I THINK IT'S A REALLY NICEINITIATIVE.
AND TO SHOW SUPPORT, I AM GOINGTO GO TO STARBUCKS.
I'M GOING TO BUY A COFFEE ANDEVEN ONE OF THOSE INDY FOLK ROCK
THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODYON THE ALBUMS.
>> THANKS, JON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HOWARD SCHULTZ.
