ME.
[LAUGHTER]
HAD A GOOD WEEKEND.
I SLEPT.
I SPENT A LOT OF IT DRESSED AS A
BOXER.
IT WILL MAKE SENSE.
WATCHING SOME OF THE REACTION TO
THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY.
GOOD THING I WAS DRESSED THAT
WAY.
>> ALL OF US HERE AT COUNTDOWN
AND ALL LOT OF US HAD ONE MAJOR
WELL DEFINED PROBLEM OF THE
RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY AND OR
FEAR.
SPEAK UP FOR THE POWERLESS IS
NOT THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF
STICKING UP FOR THE POWERFUL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHOA.
THAT STUNNING.
I DON'T THINK -- THAT STUNG.
I DON'T THINK WE WERE EQUATING
THE TWO.
WE SPEND A --
>> I KNOW EVERYBODY LIKES TO SAY
IT'S CABLE NEWS.
IT'S ALL THE SAME, FOX AND
MSNBC.
MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER.
THAT IS NEVER TRUE IN ANYWAY.
THAT AND WHAT THE REST OF US DO
FOR A LIVING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: MY TEETH CAME OUT.
WHY?
I UNDERSTAND THAT -- I DO CASE
DEGREE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW POLITICAL
PUNDIT SLASH COMEDIANS ARE NOT
GOING TO UNDERSTAND COMEDIANS
SLASH POLITICAL PUNDITS LIKE ME
AND BILL MAHER.
>> IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A
RALLY MAKE IT ABOUT SOMETHING.
I DON'T NEED TO PRETEND THAT
BOTH SIDES HAS A POINT HERE.
TWO OPPOSING SIDES DON'T
NECESSARILY HAVE TWO COMPELLING
ARGUMENT.
IF IT'S TOO POLLARRIZING FOR YOU
AND YOU WANT TO REACH ACROSS THE
AISLE, HOLD HAND AND SING WITH
SOMEONE ON THE RIGHT, TRY CHURCH
[COUNTING IN SLOW MOTION] EIGHT,
NINE, TEN.
>>
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: FOR THIS I PAY $12 A
MONTH.
DAMN YOU HBO.
[LAUGHTER]
CLEARLY THE RALLY WAS A MASSIVE
FAILURE.
SINCE MY INTENTION WAS NOT, AS
BILL DESCRIBED, TO MAKE NO MORAL
JUDGMENT BETWEEN COMPETING
ARGUMENTS AND SAY LET'S ALL GET
ALONG.
OR SUGGEST WE BE MORE JUDICIAL
WITH BLANKET SLANDER.
I'M LEFT WITH NO CHOICE.
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
THIS SATURDAY NOVEMBER 13 JOIN
ME FOR THE RALLY TO DETERMINE
PERCENT SAOEUSLY THE PERCENTAGE
OF BLAME TO BE DOLED OUT TO THE
LEFT AND RIGHT FOR OUR PROBLEMS
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS IS THE OTHER GUYS
ARE WORSE THAN WE ARE AND OR
FEAR.
WE'RE DOING THIS PEOPLE.
THIS IS FOR REAL.
ARIANNA GET THE BUSES.
PORT-A-POTTY PETE GET YOUR
PORT-APOTIES.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
KID ROCK CALL OZZY AND R2D2
WE'RE GETTING THE BAND BACK
TOGETHER, DUDE.
[LAUGHTER]
I WANTED TO SAY THIS:   CONTRARY
TO WHAT PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE I DO
THINK IT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING
JUST NECESSARILY WHAT THEY
WANTED IT TO BE ABOUT OR WHAT
THEY THINK IT WAS ABOUT.
IF WE WERE INARTFUL, WE WERE
INARTFUL.
I DISAGREE WITH THEIR
CLASSIFICATION OF IT BUT I'M
SURE WE CAN CLARIFY IT ON EACH
OTHER'S PROGRAMS FOR TEN YEARS.
WE'RE FREE TO DISAGREE.
THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT
AMERICA WE HAVE THE FREEDOM FOR
OUR OWN OPINIONS AND SAY AND DO
WHAT WE WISH.
>> MSNBC HAS SUSPENDED KEITH OL
HERMAN -- OLBERMAN FOR MAKING
POLITICAL DONATIONS.
>> Jon: ALMOST ANYBODY.
HE MADE CAMPAIGN DONATIONS
WITHOUT OBTAINING PERMISSION
FROM THE NETWORK BECAUSE MSNBC
HAS A HARD AND FAST RULE THAT
POLITICAL DONATIONS REPRESENT
BIAS IN JOURNALISM UNLESS YOU
ASK FIRST.
YOU LEARN YOUR MANNERS BOY OR
I'LL KNOCK YOU DOWN TO HOSTING
HEADLINERS AND LEGENDS SO FAST
YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN.
HE WAS SUSPENDED INDEAF FITLY.
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THEY SUSPENDED
HIS MUSTACHE.
BOOM!
THAT WAS GRATUITOUS.
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG IT
WILL BE UNTIL WE SEE HIM AGAIN.
>> KEITH OLBERMAN WILL BE BACK
ON THE AIR TOMORROW NIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: LESSON LEARNED.
[LAUGHTER]
YES, MSNBC IT'S A STUPID RULE
