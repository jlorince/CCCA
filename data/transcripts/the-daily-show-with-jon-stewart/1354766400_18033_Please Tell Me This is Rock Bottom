WOULD MAKE A GREAT CHIEF DIPLOMAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINALLY, A RIGHTEOUS MISSION OF WORLDWIDE EQUAL RIGHTS FOR THE DISABLED
WITH THE SUPPORT OF WAR HEROES AND SENATE ELDER STATE MEN IN A WORLD GONE MAD, AMERICAN CAN
LEAD AND RESCHAIM ITS EXCEPTIONAL MORAL AUTHORITY.
>> THEY NEEDED 66 VOTES.
IT'S A TREATY, TWO-THIRD OF THE SENATE AND IT FAILED.
>> Jon:  ( BLEEP ).
HOW DID THAT FAIL!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR OW NEW SEGMENT, "PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS ROCK BOTTOM." ( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ) HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
>> 38 REPUBLICANS VOTED NO.
>> TO VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT IS EVEN PERCEIVED TO BE GRANTING THE U.N. POWER IS A DANGEROUS
GAME FOR A REPUBLICAN SENATOR BECAUSE THE U.N. IS SO UNPOPULAR AMONG THE REPUBLICAN BASE.
>> Jon:  OH, MY GOD.
( LAUGHTER ).
IT'S OFFICIAL-- REPUBLICANS HATE THE UNITED NATIONS MORE THAN THEY LIKE HELPING PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS.
( LAUGHTER ) LOOK, I'M WILLING TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND HERE.
WHAT ARE YOUR ( BLEEP ) REASONS FOR OPPOSING THIS?
>> WE ALREADY HAVE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DISABILITY RIGHTS LAWS AND PROTECTIONS IN THE WORLD.
PERIOD.
>> IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THE DISABLED.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
SO BY SIGNING THIS, WE ARE, THROUGH OUR MORAL LEADERSHIP AND HOPE BEACONING, ENCOURAGES THE
OTHER SIGNATORIES IN THE WORLD TO LIVE UP TO THE ONLY STANDARD THAT NEVER LOSES VALUE...
GOLD.
( LAUGHTER ).
I DON'T GET IT.
IT CAN'T JUST BE YOU REJECT TRYING TO GET OTHER COUNTRIES TO LIVE UP TO AMERICA'S IDEALS.
THAT CAN'T BE IT.
SHOW US SOMETHING ELSE, MAYBE NAY SIZE CRAZY.
>> IT'S WITH GRAVE CONCERN FOR SOVEREIGNTY THAT I OPPOSE THIS U.N. TREATY.
>> THE TREATY COULD BE USED TO INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY OF PARENTS WITH DISABLED CHILDREN
TO DECIDE WHAT ACTION IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR CHILDREN.
THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY-- AFFECT THOSE PARENTS WHO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  YEAH, THAT'S-- THAT'S THE STUFF.
THAT'S THE STUFF.
YOU VOTED NO BECAUSE YOUR FEAR IS IF WE SIGN ON TO A TREATY THAT IS ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
IMPROVED DISABILITY STANDARDS, STANDARDS WE MADE THE LAW OF THE LAND 20 YEARS AGO, WHAT'S TO
STOP THE MEN IN BLUE HELMETS FROM STORMING INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM-- I'M SORRY, SCHOOL-- AND
FORCE YOU TO BUILD A WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE RAMP TO THE CAFETERIA-- I'M SORRY, YOUR KITCHEN.
( LAUGHTER ) OR THAT ADAM AND EVE DIDN'T RIDE A STEGGASAURUS.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU OBJECT TO IN THIS BOB-DOLE-SUPPORTED TREATY THAT WILL FORCE AMERICANS TO BOW DOWN
TO THE U.N.?
>> THIS TREATY SIMPLY HAS NO ENFORCEMENT MECHISM.
>> Jon:  MOTHER ( BLEEP )!
( LAUGHTER ) BOY, THE U.N. REALLY THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.
AN ALL-POWERFUL, ONE-WORLD TREATY WITH NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM.
LIKE ONE OF THEM CHINESE FINGERED TRAPS.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS RELAX YOUR FINGERS AND I'M FREE!
HOW ABOUT THIS?
HOW ABOUT WE CHANGE THE TREATY TO INCLUDE A CLASSIFICATION OF DELUSIONAL PARANOIA AS A DISABILITY.
( LAUGHTER ) SO NOW THAT YOU'LL BE COVERED, ARE WE GOOD?
