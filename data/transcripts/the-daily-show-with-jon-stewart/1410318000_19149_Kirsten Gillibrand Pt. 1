(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
HELLO!
HOW ARE YOU?
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
(APPLAUSE)WE HAVE YOUR BRAND-NEW BOOK
THERE, KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. "OFFTHE SIDELINES." THE IDEA OF
BEING -- THE SUGGESTION BEINGPEOPLE, WOMEN IN PARTICULAR
AS YOU WRITE THE BOOK, THEY NEEDTO GET INVOLVED, THEY
NEED TO GET THERE AND STARTCHANGING THINGS FOR THE BETTER.
>> RIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT ASKING WOMEN TO BEHEARD ON THE ISSUES THEY CARE
ABOUT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE MOREWOMEN WHO TELL THEIR STORIES,
THE MORE WOMEN WHO GETINVOLVED IN THEIR P.T.A. OR
THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR EVENIN CONGRESS...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT OUTCOMES WILL BEDIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT
HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE,THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THECOUNTRY STRONGER.
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT THIS ISINTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WRITE --
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS-- YOU MADE A VERY
CONSCIOUS DECISION IN YOUR LIFETHAT IT LACKED THE MEANING
THAT YOU WANTED IT TO HAVE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND, SO, YOU MADE THATDIRECTIONAL CHANGE.
VERY PURPOSEFUL.
>> YEAH, SO I WAS JUST SITTINGAT MY BIG LAW FIRM PUSHING
PAPER, AND I WATCHED HILLARYCLINTON GO TO CHINA AND GIVE HER
BIG SPEECH ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTSARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN
RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I FELT I WASN'T DOINGANYTHING, AND SO THAT'S WHAT
REALLY MOTIVATED ME TO GETINVOLVED IN POLITICS AND I
WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.AND, YOU KNOW, I HAD GREAT ROLE
MODELS IN MY LIFE. NOT ONLY WASHILLARY CLINTON ONE, BUT
MY MOTHER WAS A WOMAN WHO WORKEDAND TOOK CARE OF US AT HOME.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND I JUST REMEMBER DAYS
WHEN SHE'S GOT HER PHONE INONE HAND DEALING WITH A LAW CASE
AND COOKING DINNER AND SWEEPINGTHE FLOOR AT THE SAME TIME.
>> Jon: HOW MANY ARMS DID YOURMOTHER HAVE?
>> SEVERAL. SHE WAS THE QUEEN OFMULTI-TASKING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BUT IT GAVE ME THIS ROLE
MODEL AND THIS NOTION THAT YOUCAN BE A GOOD MOM AND DO A JOB
AT WORK WELL AT THE SAME TIME,AND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DECIDE AND YOU CAN DO BOTH...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YOU CAN GIVE BACK TO YOURCOMMUNITY.
I ALSO LEARNED FROM HER, SHESPENT HER FREE TIME LEARNING
KARATE AND SHE EARNED A SECONDDEGREE BLACK BELT BY THE
TIME SHE WAS MY AGE.>> IS YOUR MOM WONDER WOMAN?
>> SORT OF.
>> Jon: SHE HAS A SECONDDEGREE BLACK BELT IN KARATE?
AND SHE'S A LAWYER?
>> YES. YES. AND SHE'D COME HOMEWITH BRUISES ON HER ARMS.
AND I THOUGH, MOM, WHAT ARE YOUDOING, BUT IT WAS WHAT SHE LIKED
TO DO. SHE ENJOYED IT. AND IPLAY TENNIS, SO YOU KNOW,
DIFFERENT. BUT I DOSOMETHING NOW IN MY LIFE.
THE BOOK IS ABOUT -- THE REASONWHY I TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE
THESE PERSONAL STORIES...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO TALK ABOUT MY ROLE MODELSIS BECAUSE I WANTED WOMEN
TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES INTHESE STORIES AND MY GOAL IS TO
INSPIRE EVEN ONE GIRL, ONE WOMANTO FIGHT FOR THE ISSUES SHE
CARES ABOUT...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHATEVER IT IS,AND TO SHOW HER THAT, YOU
KNOW, I STRUGGLEDIN THE SAME WAY...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I SUFFERED SOME OFTHE SAME CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT
MY LIFE AND THAT EVEN DESPITETHAT AND WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING
THROUGH, THEY CAN TOO MAKE ADIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK WOMENSTILL NEED THAT ENCOURAGEMENT?
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T, YOU KNOW,THAT IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, A MAN
WOULD WRITE A BOOK AND SAY, IJUST WANT MEN TO GET INVOLVED
BECAUSE THEY MATTER, TOO.>> YES, THEY DO.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, MEN WOULDNEVER -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
THERE IS THAT SENSE, MENHAVE ALREADY CONTROLLED
EVERYTHING FOR SO LONG THATTHEY NEVER NEED THAT EXTRA
PUSH AND YOU WOULD THINK, ATTHIS POINT, WITH ALL THAT
WOMEN HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, THATTHAT WOULD BE CLEAR, AND YET IT
STILL CAN NEVER BE SAID ENOUGH.YOU CAN BE HEARD.
>> AND YOU HEAR IT A LOT.YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN I DO?
I'M JUST A COLLEGE STUDENT,I'M JUST A YOUNG WOMAN.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I'VE WATCHED TWOWOMEN WALK  INTO MY OFFICE
ASK FOR A MEETING. THESE TWOWOMEN, ANDREA AND ANNIE, AND
SAY WE WANT TO MEETWITH A SENATOR.
AND SO WE MADE A PRIORITY ANDMET WITH THEM, AND THEY TOLD ME
THEIR STORY ABOUTHOW THEY WERE RAPED ON CAMPUS...
>> Jon: OH MY GOD.
>> THEY REPORTED IT AND NOTBELIEVED, AND THEN RETALIATED
AGAINST BY THEIR UNIVERSITIES.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THOSE WOMEN ARE NOWCREATING A NATIONAL
MOVEMENT AND SPEAKING UP ONCOLLEGE CAMPUSES ALL ACROSS THE
COUNTRY...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND DEMANDING ACTION BY THEADMINISTRATIONS AT THOSE
SCHOOLS. THOSE GIRLS ARECHANGING THE WORLD.
>> Jon: WELL, EVEN AT THE LOCALLEVEL. SO HERE'S, I MEAN,
NOW TAKE THAT STORY,YOU WERE IN CONGRESS AND
INTRODUCE A BILL ABOUT SEXUALASSAULT IN THE MILITARY...
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: TO CHANGE THECULTURE.
AND THIS IS WITHIN THEUNITED STATES SENATE AND THAT
GETS FILIBUSTERED...>> CORRECT.
>> Jon: AND THAT CAN'T GETTHROUGH. I MEAN,
SO THE IDEA THEY'REDOING IT -- HOW DO YOU CHANGE
THAT -- WHAT MESSAGE DOES THATSEND WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT CAN'T
EVEN PROTECT THE WOMEN WHO AREIN OUR OWN MILITARY?
>> WELL, THE MESSAGE OF THE BOOKIS NOT TO GIVE UP, IS THAT...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, THESE STORIESMATTER. YOUR PERSONAL STORIES,
WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO REPEALDON'T ASK DON'T TELL, AND YOU'RE
TELLING YOUR STORY ABOUT WHATIT WAS LIKE TO HAVE TO LIE TO
EVERYONE IN YOUR LIFE ABOUTSERVING IN THE MILITARY...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND HAVING TO HIDE WHO YOU
LOVE. OR WHETHER IT'S ABOUTSEXUAL ASSAULT
IN THE MILITARY AND TELLING YOURCOMMANDER AND YOUR COMMANDER
SAYING IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> IT'S ASSURANCE TO WOMEN WHOREAD IT TO SAY KEEPING FOCUSED
ON WHAT MATTERS TO YOU,FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AND, YOUKNOW THERE'S HEARTBREAKING
STORIES IN THERE, TOO, LIKE THEMOM WHO LOST HER CHILD BECAUSE
OF A DROP-SIDE CRIB, BUT THOSECRIBS WERE BANNED WITHIN NINE
MONTHS BECAUSE PARENTS SPOKE UPAND SAID THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO IT'S AN INTIMATECONVERSATION WITH WOMEN ABOUT
THINGS WE CARE ABOUT AND IINCLUDE LOTS OF DETAILS ABOUT
THE EVERYDAY STRUGGLES I HAVEFROM JUST MAKING LUNCHES IN THE
MORNING, GETTING BREAKFAST ONTHE TABLE AND GETTING OUT THE
DOOR IN TIME WITH THE SOCCERUNIFORM SO THAT ANY MOM
READING THE BOOK CAN SAY, OHWOW, SHE DOES SOME OF THE SAME
STUFF I DO...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEY CAN SEETHEMSELVES IN THOSE CHALLENGES.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE REASON IBRING THE EXAMPLES UP IS
BECAUSE SOME OF THE CHALLENGESWOMEN FACE ARE MUCH HARDER.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE FLEXIBILITY INMY JOB AND --
>> Jon: SURE.>> BUT THE LADY WHO'S GOING
TO... >> Jon: AND YOU HAVE A JOB.
>> AND I HAVE A JOB...
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKINGABOUT...
>> AND I'M WELL PAID.
>> Jon: SOME WOMEN LIVE INPOVERTY. THEY HAVE A VERY
DIFFICULT TIME.
>> WE TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY FOREQUAL WORK.
WE TALK ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE.BUT THE LADY WHO'S GOING TO
CLEAN THIS STUDIO TONIGHT, SHEDOESN'T HAVE ANY
FLEXIBILITY. SHE HAS TO WORK THEHOURS SHE'S ASKED TO WORK.
>> Jon: I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWSFOR YOU.
>> SHE HAS FLEXIBILITY?
>> Jon: NO, WE HAVEN'T CLEANEDTHIS STUDIO...
THERE IS NO WOMAN WHO DOES THAT.
(LAUGHTER)WHEN WE COME BACK, THOUGH,
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEINSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES
THAT ARE PUT IN WOMEN'S WAY.BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BE MORE
APROPOS. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SEEINGIN THIS RAY RICE CASE, YOU'RE
SEEING IT IN HARASSMENTSYOU DETAIL IN THE BOOK
THAT OCCURED FOR YOU.>> YES.
>> YOU'RE SEEING IT IN THEPRESIDENT NOT BACKING YOUR BILL
ON SEXUAL ASSAULTIN THE MILITARY.
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEINSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES.
WE'LL BE BACK, SENATORGILLIBRAND, JUST ONE SECOND.
