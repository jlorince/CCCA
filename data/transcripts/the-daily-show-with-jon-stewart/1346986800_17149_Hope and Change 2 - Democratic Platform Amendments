WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUESTS TONIGHT AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT NOW
LIVING A GLORIOUS AND CARE-FREE LIFE OF DECADENCE AS A TENURED COLLEGE PROFESSOR.
BARACK OBAMA, I'M ASSUMING HAS JUST FINISHED HIS SPEECH ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION OF
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND AT THE END OF IT THREW DOWN HIS MIKE AND SAID [BLEEP] ALL Y'ALL.
THAT WAS WEIRD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET'S BEGIN THE NIGHT WITH NIGHT 2 OF THE DEMOCRATIC
NATIONAL CONVENTION WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE CAPITALIZED-- THE PASSIONATE POPULISM OF DEVAL PATRICK.
THE LO QUA SHOULDNESS OF UNO E DUAL AND MICHELLE OBAMA WHO CRUSHED IT SO HARD
REPUBLICANS WERE DESPERATE TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
>> REPUBLICANS ARE NOW BLASTING THE DEMOCRAT'S PLATFORM.
>> WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE THAT JERUSALEM SHOULD BE THE CAPITAL IMOF ISRAEL.
>> THE WORD GOD WAS GONE.
THE ONE REFERENCE BEFORE,
THE REPUBLICANS HAD 12 REFERENCES OF GOD.
>> HOW THERE CAN BE AN ENTIRE SECTION ON FAITH IF YOU DON'T MENTION GOD WITH.
WHAT DO WE HAVE FAITH IN.
>> I HAVE FAITH IN A GOD WITHOUT ISN'T SO INSECURE HE DOESN'T FREAK OUT IF YOU
DON'T MENTION HIS NAME ENOUGH.
GOD IS NOT A MEDIA FIGURE,
YOU KNOW.
GOD ISN'T LIKE AN INSIDE THE BELTWAY MEDIA FIGURE WHO FIRST THING THEY DO WHEN
THEY GET A BOOK IS CHECK THEIR INDEX FOR THE NAMES.
GOD DOESN'T DO THAT THAT IS WEIRD YOU MENTIONED TREES AND SAVING THE EARTH BUT YOU
DON'T MENTION THE GUY WHO CREATED THE WHOLE THING, I MEAN, ALL I'M SAYING IS
WHATEVER, GUYS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT WAS MY IMPRESSION OF GOD.
(LAUGHTER) AND NOT VERY GOOD.
BUT GUESS WHAT, DEMOCRATS AREN'T GOING TO GET SUCKED INTO THAT GAME.
DIDN'T YOU HEAR DEVAL PATRICK.
>> IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATIC TO GROW A BACKBONE AND STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE!
>> Jon: BOOM, AND I MEAN,
BOOM.
ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY, NOT REALLY HOW BACKBONES WORK.
YOU CAN'T JUST GROW ONE FORCE OF WILL.
MY POINT IS THIS--  (LAUGHTER) DEMOCRATS AIN'T GOING TO GET DISTRACTED BY YOUR BULL
[BLEEP] PARTISAN WHINING AND REDO A PLATFORM THAT --
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I MOVE THAT WE SUSPEND THE RULES TO PERMIT AN AMENDMENT TO THE
PLATFORM ADOPTED BY THIS CONVENTION LAST NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DO APPROXIMATING?
REVERSING YOUR PRINCIPLESES TO APPEAL TO HARD-CORE DEAD-END REPUBLICANS?
WHO ARE YOU, MITT ROMNEY?
(LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY AT THE URGING OF FOX NEWS, DEMOCRATS DRAFTED LANGUAGE THAT GOD AND
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL BACK IN THEIR PLATFORM.
>> THE MATTER REQUIRES A TWO-THIRDS VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.
ALL THOSE DELEGATES IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
ALL THOSE DELEGATES OPPOSED SAY NO.
>> IN THE OPINION OF THE-- LET ME DO THAT AGAIN.

ON THE BRIGHT SIDE WE HAVE FINALLY DISCOVERED THE EVIDEN
