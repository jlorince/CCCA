NORTH AFRICA.
OUR NEW SEGMENT.
INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANDER CAKES.
FIRST UP, RUSSIA WHERE NEWLY RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT VLADE MILES AN HOUR PUTIN... JUST GO TO THE TAPE.
>> I MEAN IT'S POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE INSIDE THE KREMLIN.
PUTIN IS SWORN IN AS RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT.
>> PUTIN WON RUSSIA'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN MARCH BUT OPPOSITION LEADERS CLAIM
THAT HE DID SO LARGELY BECAUSE OF FRAUD AND BALLOT STUFFING.
>> Jon: A BUNCH OF SORE LOSERS.
AND BY "SORE," I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN BEATEN BRUTALLY.
THEY ACTUALLY ARE BRUISED.
PUTIN'S INAUGURATION BEGAN, OF COURSE, WITH THE TRADITIONAL SWEARING-IN BY PLACING THE
HAND UPON RUSSIA'S WINE LIST.
AND THE PRESIDENTIAL STRUT THROUGH RUSSIA'S FAMED SALUTE TO THE VALUES OF THE
STRUGGLING PROCEED LEE TEAR YAT ROOM.
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE INSIDE OF DONALD TRUMP'S ANUS.
LOOK AT THAT THING.
THE PEOPLE MUST CONTROL THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION.
(BEEP) ARE THOSE DIAMONDS?
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT PUTIN'S MELODRAMATIC GOVERNING STYLE, HIS HARD-LINE
OPPRESSION OF FREE PRESS AND DISSENT IN ANY FORM, YOU HAD TO BE MOVED BY HOW MUCH PUTIN
IS ENJOYING THIS MOMENT.
THERE HE IS.
LIVING IN... LIVING THE DREAM.
JUST BESIDE HIMSELF.
OVERJOYED.
CAN'T BELIEVE... HE SAYS, I HAVE BEEN HAPPIER GETTING A COLONOSCOPY.
THIS MAN IS BEING... THE MAN'S FACE LOOKS LIKE HOW YOU WOULD IMAGINE A NOVEL
CHARACTERISTICALLY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WERE OVERJOYED.
>> PUTIN HAS POWER ILLEGITIMATELY ILLEGALLY COME TO POWER AGAIN.
>> Jon: WHAT A NICE MAN.
HE WILL
