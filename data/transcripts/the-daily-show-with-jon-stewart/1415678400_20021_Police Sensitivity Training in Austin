(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM.
LAW ENFORCEMENT, LAWENFORCEMENT IS A DIFFICULT
JOB BUT RECENTLY THERE HAVEBEEN EXAMPLES OF POLICE
SHOOTING FIRST AND ASKINGQUESTIONS, NOT ASKING
QUESTIONS, JUST SHOOTING.
THANKFULLY, ONE POLICEDEPARTMENT IS TAKING AN
INNOVATIVE APPROACH TOPROBLEMS, JORDAN KLEPPER HAS
MORE.
>> CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICEIS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW.
WITH THE RECENT EVENTS INFERGUSON AND EIGHT MILES
AWAY FROM FERGUSON AND OVERHERE AND THERE, AND RIGHT
HERE, HERE AS WELL, ANDSTATEN ISLAND, PRETTY OF ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY, IT'S NOWONDER MANY COMMUNITIES LIKE
THIS ONE IN NEW JERSEYHAVE LOST FAITH IN THE
POLICE.
>> I'M MORE AFRAID OF THEPOLICE THAN I AM OF
CRIMINALS.
>> THERE NEEDS TO BE MORETRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT.
>> THEY NEED TO TRAIN ON HOW TODEAL WITH THE COMMUNITY.
>> THE TWO POLICE OFFICERSAT THE END OF THE PANEL,
WHAT ARE YOUR GUYS' THOUGHTS.
>> I'M NOT A COP>> YEAH, WE'RE JUST WHITE.
>> SO YOU ARE JUST WHITEGUYS AND YOU STILL DON'T
LIKE THE POLICE.
>> I WANT TO LIKE THE POLICEBUT I'VE DEALT WITH THE
POLICE.
SO IT'S HARD.
>> OKAY, LET ME LOOK INTOTHIS.
>> HOW DO POLICE RESTOREPUBLIC TRUST.
ONE DEPARTMENT IS TACKLINGTHE PROBLEM HEAD ON
BY LAUNCHING A BRAND-NEWSENSITIVITY TRAINING PROGRAM.
OFFICER PHIL CROCHET OF THEAUSTIN PD.
>> WE HAD A COUPLE OFFAIRLY CONTROVERSIAL POLICE
SHOOTINGS.
AND MY ASSISTANT CHIEFCALLED ME AND ASKED ME IF WE
COULD GET SOME KIND OFTRAINING TO TRY TO PREVENT
FUTURE SHOOTINGS FROMOCCURRING.
>> IT IS GREAT TO HEAR THATA POLICE DEPARTMENT IS
FINALLY TAKING THE STEPS TOPROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE
MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY FROMBEING SHOT AT.
>> WE ALWAYS SHOOT FOR BESTPRACTICES.
WE ALWAYS TRY FOR BESTPRACTICES.
>> SO HOW DO YOU TRAINOFFICERS TO BE MORE
SENSITIVE AND MAYBE LESSTRIGGER HAPPY?
>> I MET WITH PROGRAMFOUNDER JIM OSORIO TO FIND OUT
WHAT EXACTLY THIS TRAININGENTAILED.
>> BASICALLY THE PROGRAM ISACTUALLY TO KEEP LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ACROSSTHE COUNTRY AND EVEN HERE IN
AUSTIN, I WANT THEM TO TRYSOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN
JUST PULLING THEIR GUN ANDSHOOTING.
>> SHOOTING SHOULD COMEWHEN?
>> AS A LAST RESORT.
THAT'S WHY I TELL OFFICERSUSE THEIR BATON.
TAKE YOUR BATON OUT THERE,THEY'RE GOING TO BITE YOUR
BATON FIRST.
>> WHAT.
>> EVERY ANIMAL CAN BITE.
>> ANIMAL IS A TOUGH TERM.
>> WELL, THEY'RE ALLANIMALS.
>> THEY'RE NOT ALL ANIMALS.
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT DOGS.
>> OH.

PEOPLE, IT'S TO NOT SHOOTDOGS.
>> EXACTLY>> NOW, I SEE.
OH, THAT'S SO SAD.
>> BUT WHY DOGS. MAYBE MARGOFRASER OF THE AUSTIN POLICE
MONITOR WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER.
>> THERE IS MORE REACTIONWHEN A DOG IS SHOT, AS FAR
AS PUBLIC OUTCRY, AS FAR ASCALLING OUR OFFICE THAN WHEN
IT'S A HUMAN BEING
THE PHONE SYSTEM ESSENTIALLYGETS SHUT DOWN.
>> THAT'S WHEN-- PEOPLESTART CALLING.
>> THAT'S WHEN THE CALLSCOME.
>> HOW COULD HUMANS CAREMORE ABOUT DOGS THAN OTHER
HUMAN-- AWWW, LOOK ATTHIS CUTIE.
JUST ADORABLE.
WHO IS A CUTIE, WHO'S ACUTIE?
OH OKAY, I GET IT.

ABOUT DOGS.

NOT WANT TO SHOOT IT.>> ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU CAN'T SHOOT CATS NOW?WOULD YOU SHOOT A PARROT
THAT SAID "THE AUSTIN PD AREA BUNCH OF PUSSIES."
>> NO, I WOULDN'T SHOOT THATPARROT.
>> SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THEPROGRAM IS WORKING.
>> IT'S TOO EARLY YET TOTELL WHAT THE NUMBERS MIGHT
BE.
BUT JUST THE FACT THAT WE'REMAKING AN EFFORT, THAT PUTS
US IN A BETTER LIGHT.
>> WHAT ABOUT A SENSITIVITYTRAINING PROGRAM FOR
OFFICERS THAT DEALS WITHSHOOTING HUMANS.
>> WE GIVE OFFICERS A LOT OFTRAINING IN THAT REGARD.
OFFICERS ARE GIVEN ANASSIGNMENT TO GO OUT AND
INTERVIEW PEOPLE, NORMALLYIT'S AN UNDERSERVED PORTION
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, LESBIAN,GAY, BISEXUAL.
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME IF I JOIN THE AUSTIN POLICE
DEPARTMENT I COULD GET PAIDTO OBSERVE LESBIANS?
>> THAT COULD BE ANASSIGNMENT, YET.
>> HOW THREATENING ARELESBIANS ON A SCALE OF
ZERO TO SEXY.>> LESBIANS ARE NO THREATENING
IN JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARELESBIANS.
>> SO HOT, RIGHT?
>> YET SOME PEOPLE IN OTHERCOMMUNITIES THINK TRAINING
ISN'T ENOUGH.
>> SENSITIVITY TRAINING THATTHEY ALREADY HAVE IS A JOKE
>> IT IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEMSO I THINK THAT ANY SOLUTION
YOU ARE GOING GET IS GOINGTO COME ALONG SIDE A
CULTURAL SHIFT.
>> BUT CULTURAL SHIFTS TAKEDECADES.
IF ONLY THERE WAS A QUICKERWAY TO MAKE PEOPLE AS
SYMPATHETIC AND HUGGABLE ASDOGS-- WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S
IT.
FINALLY, A BULLETPROOFSOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT
OTHERWISE BE TARGETS OFPOLICE BULLETS
KEEP IT SAFE, DOGGIE STYLE(APPLAUSE)
