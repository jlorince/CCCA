MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT, ONE OF OUR FAVORITES,
MELISSA McCARTHY IS GOING TOBE JOINING US, WE'RE VERY
EXCITED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, AS WEALL KNOW, YOU KNOW, WE'RE
AMERICANS, WE KNOW AMERICA'SLONG STRUGGLE WITH THE WHOLE
"ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL" THING THAT WE PUT THERE IN THAT
DOCUMENT.
SEEMS LAKE EVERY DECADE ORSO WE AS A NATION NEED TO
ASK OURSELVES, YOU KNOW, ALLMEN, REALLY, ALL?
BLACK PEOPLE, ASIANS,EVERYBODY, REALLY, ALL?
ESKIMOS, SERIOUSLY?
WELL, LATELY MUSLIMS HAVEBEEN SUBJECT TO THE EQUAL
PEOPLE TEST,  AND, WELL,THERE IS GOOD NEWS AND BAD
NEWS.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEWISLAMIC AFFAIRS SEGMENT,
HALAL THINGS CONSIDERED.
LET'S START WITH THE GOODNEWS.
>> JUSTICES RULED IN FAVOROF A YOUNG MUSLIM WOMAN WHO
WAS REJECTED FROM WORKINGAT THE CLOTHING STORE
ABERCROMBIE & FITCH.
>> SHE WORE A HIJAB TO THEJOB INTERVIEW AND WAS DENIED
A JOB BECAUSE THE HEAD SCARFVIOLATED THE RETAILER'S LOOK
POLICY.
>> Jon: SHE WON!
SHE WON, IT WASDISAPPOINTING SHE WAS PUT IN
THAT POSITION BUT SHE WON.
SHE STOOD UP AGAINSTDISCRIMINATION AND TRIUMPHED
AND AS A REWARDS FOR HERBRAVE STRUGGLE I'M PROUD TO
SAY THAT SHE CAN NOW WORK ATABERCROMBIE & FITCH.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE HAS WON THE RIGHT TO SPENDEIGHT HOURS A DAY IN A CLOUD OF
COLOGNE SELLING PINK POLOSHIRTS TO GUYS NAMED CHAD.
SO WINNING THE RIGHT TO WORKIN A PSEUDO SEXSHOP IS A
PRIORIC VICTORY, BUT THAT IS NOTTHE BAD NEWS.
>> CLAIMS OF DISCRIMINALFACIAL OF A MUSLIM WOMAN WHO
CLAIMS SHE WAS DENIED ANUNUNOPEN CAN OF SODA AT 30,000
FEET.
SHE WAS BASICALLY TRYING TO SAY TAHTI WHAT USE A CAN OF SODA AS
A WEAPON.
>> Jon: OKAY, SOUNDS BAD.
BUT LOOK, YOU TAKE THAT SODA,YOU ADD ALKA-SELTZER AND A
SEAGULL AND YOU'VE GOTYOURSELF A BOMB ON AN AIRPLANE.
I MEAN THERE'S-- THERE'S AREASON THAT THEY DON'T LET
YOU BRING SEAGULLS ONAIRPLANES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT'S-- WEIRD, WHEN THESEAGULL BLOWS UP AS ITS
APPENDS AGES STAY INTACT...JUST  THE FEATHERS...
NOW YOU CAN AGREE ORDISAGREE WITH THE AIRLINE
POLICY OF DISTRIBUTION OFUNOPENED CANS BUT ARE WE
REALLY SURE THIS ISDISCRIMINATION.
>> SHE ASKED THE MAN NEXT TO MEWHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DRINK,
AND HE REQUESTED A CAN OFBEER.
AND SHE, I NOTICED THAT SHEPLACED IT IN FRONT OF HIM
AND IT WAS A CLOSED BEVERAGECAN.
>> Jon: OKAY, OKAY, SEEMSLIKE A DOUBLE STANDARD.
BUT YOU THINK ABOUT T WHENHAS A WHITE GUY POUNDING
BEERS ON AN AIRPLANE EVERLEAD TO VIOLENCE.
IT'S JUST-- I'M BEING TOLDALMOST EVERY TIME --
ALMOST EVERY TIME.
WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE AHORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
BUT AS WITH ANY SITUATIONINVOLVING A MAJOR AIRLINE,
IT COULD ALWAYS GET WORSE.
>> I ASKED THE PASSENGERSAROUND ME, I SAID, DOES
ANYONE WITNESS WHAT SHE JUSTSAID TO ME.
I SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THATI WOULD USE IT AS A WEAPON.
AND THEN A MAN SITTING, YOUKNOW, ACROSS FROM ME SAID
YOU MUSLIM, YOU NEED TO SHUTTHE F UP.
[AUDIENCE GROANS]
>> Jon: THAT IS-- I'M SCOCKED ATWHAT GOES ON IN COACH.
BOY.
AM I RIGHT?
I MEAN IT'S-- CAN'T YOU JUSTSAY, CAN'T YOU JUST SAY TO
THE PERSON, COME ON, CALMDOWN, THE SUNDAYS WILL BE
OUT ANY MINUTE, ALONG WITHTHE LIVE MUSIC.
FRANK SINATRA!
YOU KNOW, IN COACH HE'S STILLDEAD, BUT IN FIRST, FLY ME TO
THE MOON.
WELL, IF THERE WAS ANYAMBIGUITY OF WHETHER OR NOT
THIS INCIDENT HAD ADISCRIMINATION COMPONENT,
OLD F-BOMB JOHNSON TOOK CARE OFTHAT.
AT LEAST NOW THE FLIGHTATTENDANT WILL SHUT THAT
DOWN.
>> THERE WAS NO BYSTANDERINVENTION.
AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTDIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO HIM
EITHER.
>> Jon: OH.
