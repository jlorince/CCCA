NEVER A BAD MOVIE FOR THAT LADYAND NEVER A BAD PERFORMANCE.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHTON THE LOCAL SIDE.
ACROSS THE RIVER, MY OWNSTATE, JERSEY.
WHERE OUR FRIEND GOVERNORCRISTOPHER CHRISTIE FINDS
HIMSELF IN A BIT OF A SITUATION.
>> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HAS A PIGPROBLEM.
>> Jon:  NOW, NOW WAIT. WAIT.
I DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'SAPPROPRIATE.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S APRODUCTIVE WAY, UNLESS I'M
OBVIOUSLY JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONSAND BY SOME ABSURD POLITICAL
TWIST THE GOVERNOR OF NEWJERSEY LITERALLY HAS A PIG
PROBLEM.
>> HE HAS TO DECIDE BY DECEMBERIF NEW JERSEY PIG FARMERS CAN
USE GESTATION CRATES.
>> Jon: OH, HE HAS A PIGPROBLEM. HE HAS A PIG PROBLEM.
[LAUGHTER]WELL YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY
SHOULDN'T HE BE ABLE TO USEGESTATION CRATES?
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.
I MEAN HOW MUCH DOES THEGOVERNMENT GOING TO CLAMP DOWN.
THEY FARMERS HAVE, NEED TO STORETHEIR, WHAT IS A GESTATION
CRATE EXACTLY?
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE CRATES ARE USED FORPREGNANT PIGS TO PREVENT THEM
FROM FIGHTING.
FARMERS ALSO SAY THE PIGS AREMUCH EASIER TO HOUSE THIS WAY.
>> Jon: RIGHT, NO, NO. THATMAKES SENSE.
IT'S EASIER TO KEEP THEM INTHESE TINY CONFINED BOXES LIKE
SHOES. [LAUGHTER]
THAT ARE ALIVE ANDCAN FEEL PAIN.
SHOES THAT CAN FEEL PAIN.
[LAUGHTER]CLEARLY AN IMPROVEMENT OVER MOST
PREVIOUS FORMS OF PIG HOUSING.
YOUR STRAW. YOUR STICKS.
[LAUGHTER]YOUR BRICKS. EVEN WITH THOSE
COSTLY SPECIALIZED UNITS. EVENWITH THOSE COSTLY UNITS
FULLY TWO THIRDS OF YOURPIGS ARE STILL VULNERABLE IN
THAT SITUATION TO WOLF ATTACK.
[LAUGHTER]WOW, IT'S REALLY.
[LAUGHTER]I BELIEVE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
PIG BLOOD.
[LAUGHTER]WELL LOOK, HEY,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT, GOVERNORCHRISTIE HAS TO WEIGH THE
BENEFITS AGAINST THE COSTS.
I MEAN THESE CRATES MIGHT HELPPIG FARMERS, AND WHAT IF ANY
ARE THE DOWN SIDE TO THE CRATES.
>> THE HUMANE SOCIETY SAYS THATTHE EXTREME CONFINEMENT OF THE
PIGS LITERALLY MAKES THEM GOINSANE.
THE CRATES PREVENT THE PIGS FROMTURNING AROUND, LYING DOWN AND
FULLY EXTENDED THEIR LIMBS.
>> Jon:  SO?
WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT EXTENDINGYOUR LIMBS?
ANYWAY, LOOK, I'M DOING IT RIGHT... OH.
OH MY, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
OH.
[BLEEP] I FEEL ALIVE.
YEAH.
OH MY GOD.
I JUST ... THE HILLS ARE ALIVE ♪WITH THE SOUND OF ♪
I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT TO RUBIT IN BUT THIS EXTENDING YOUR
LIMBS THING IS PRETTY SWEET.
[LAUGHTER]AND ANYWAY, THESE ARE JUST
GESTATIONAL CRATES.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'REPREGNANT I'M SURE ONCE
THEY GIVE BIRTH THEY GETMATERNITY LEAVE.
AND YOU KNOW PROBABLY BACK TONORMAL WITH LOTS OF MOVING
AROUND.
>> BREEDING PIGS SPEND 80% OFTHEIR LIVES PREGNANT AND SO THEY
SPEND THE BULK OF THEIR LIVES INTHESE CRATES.
>> Jon:  JEEPS [BLEEP] CHRIST.THAT IS HORRIBLE.
THESE POOR PIGS TORTURED FORLIFE.
AND FOR WHAT?
OH.
[LAUGHTER]ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A COMPELLING ARGUMENT.
BUT ALL RIGHT.
CHRISTIE'S GOT TO DECIDE BECAUSERECENTLY THE NEW JERSEY STATE
LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMINGLYPASSED A BILL BANNING THE USE OF
THESE GESTATION CRATES AND IT'SA BAN THAT'S SUPPORTED BY 93% OF
NEW JERSEY VOTERS.
I MEAN, THE ONLY THING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD MAKE
APPROVING THIS BILL MORE OF A NOBRAINER FOR CHRISTIE IS IF HE
GOT A MESSAGE FROM A MAGICALLYLITERATE SPIDER ABOUT IT.
>> CHRISTIE REPORTEDLY TOLD AGROUP OF IOWA PORK PRODUCERS HE
WILL VETO THE NEW JERSEY BILL.
WHAT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY IGUESS YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE
CITIZENS OF IOWA WHO ELECTEDYOU GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.
[LAUGHTER]WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
>> PIG FARMING ISN'T BIG IN NEWJERSEY BUT IT IS HUGE IN IOWA
WHICH IS HOME FOR THE FIRSTELECTION CAUCUSES.
>> IOWA IS THE NUMBER ONE PORKPRODUCING STATE IN THE COUNTRY.
NEW JERSEY HAS 9,000 PIGS.
IOWA IS 20 MILLION.
>> Jon:  NEXT MOVIE IDEA.
[LAUGHTER]IOWA BASED SCI-FI
THRILLER "RISE OF THE PLANET OFTHE PIGS."
[LAUGHTER]THIS SUMMER.
GO HOG WILD AND SAVE YOUR BACON.
[APPLAUSE]THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE AN ANGRY
[BLEEP] PIG RIGHT THERE.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
PURELY TO ADVANCE HISPERSONAL POLITICAL GOALS, CHRIS
CHRISTIE'S GOING TO VETO A BILLALMOST UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED BY
THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY.
WHICH IS WEIRD CONSIDERING THEKIND OF GUY CHRIS CHRISTIE
ALWAYS SAYS HE IS.
>> MY JOB IS TO STAND UP FOR THEPEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY AND
TO FIGHT FOR THEM AND THAT'SWHAT I'M GOING TO DO REGARDLESS
OF THE POLITICS.
WHAT THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEYWANT IS PEOPLE WHO COME INTO
OFFICE AND DO THEIR JOBS ANDIF YOU TRY TO CALCULATE EVERY
ONE OF THESE MOVES POLITICALLY,YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB.
I ALWAYS PUT THE PEOPLE OF NEWJERSEY AND MY OATH AHEAD OF
PETTY PERSONAL POLITICS.
>> Jon:  OF COURSE THE OBVIOUSEXCEPTIONS OF BRIDGES AND PIGS.
[BLEEP] THEM.
SO, NOW I GUESS WE KNOW GOVERNORCHRISTIE'S PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION
IS THE ONE THING HE WON'TPUT IN A TINY CRATE.
