(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SHOW!
DRUGS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUTDRUGS.

SANTA CLARA ASSISTANT COUNTYCOUNSEL DANNY CHU EXPLAINS THE
TOLL DRUGS HAVE TAKENON HIS DISTRICT.

COSTS AND IT'S ALSORESULTED IN RAMPANT CRIME.

HAS BEEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLETHAT ARE NOW ADDICTED TO THESE
DRUGS.
>> OK, BUT STREET DRUGS ARE ONETHING.
PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS ARE THERETO HELP, RIGHT?
>> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THATTHESE PRESCRIPTION PAINKILLERS
WORK WELL FOR CHRONIC PAINCONDITIONS.
>> REALLY?
>> YES.
NONETHELESS, THE DRUG COMPANIESMARKET THESE DRUGS FOR THOSE
PURPOSES.
THAT'S WHY WE FILED THIS LAWSUITTO HOLD THESE COMPANIES
ACCOUNTABLE.
>> AND THEY HAVE A LOT TO BEACCOUNTABLE FOR.
STUDIES SHOWS PROLONGED USE OFTHESE DRUGS REDUCES THEIR
EFFECTIVENESS AND INCREASESTHE RISK OF OVERDOSE.
BUT OXY REQUIRES A PRESCRIPTION.
SO HOW ARE THESE COMPANIES TOBLAME?
IT WASN'T ADDING UP. BUT THEN IGOT A VISIT FROM AUTHOR AND
MEDICAL RESEARCHER PETERGOTZSCHE.
>> I HAVE A LITTLE SECRET FORYOU!
>> I CAN'T HEAR YOU, DUDE.

TOLD ME HOW THIS EPIDEMICGOT OUT OF HAND.
>> PURDUE PHARMA LIED TOTHE DOCTORS AND TOLD THEM
THAT 0XYCONTIN ISLESS LIKELY TO LEAD TO SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND THIS IS NOT TRUE.
>> WAIT SERIOUSLY?
>> YOU CAN LOOK AT THE LAWSUITS.
PFIZER WAS FOUND GUILTY BY AJURY OF CONSPIRACY.
>> WOW!
>> MERCK, ELI LILLY, JOHNSON &JOHNSON WAS FINED MORE THAN
$1 BILLION. IT'S ALL THE SAME.
WHAT THEY DO IS ACTUALLYORGANIZED CRIME.

THEM FACE TO FACE.

PROBABLY HARD FOR YOU TO HIDE ASA BROWN DUDE IN SWEDEN.

SWEDEN?
THIS WAS STARTING TO SOUND LIKEA REAL CONSPIRACY.
THANKFULLY FORMER FDAASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER
PETER PITTS STRIGHTENEDEVERYTHING OUT.
>> I THINK PHARMACEUTICALCOMPANIES ARE
EXTREMELY STRAIGHTFORWARDAND HONEST ABOUT THE BENEFITS
AND THE RISKS OF THEIR PRODUCTS.
>> PETE, I AM SO GLAD THAT YOUCAN CALM ME DOWN, MAN
CAUSE I WAS FREAKING OUT.
SO, WHY DO PHARMACEUTICALCOMPANIES HAVE SUCH A BAD REP?
>> MICHAEL, STATISTICS ARE LIKEA BIKINI, WHAT THEY SHOW YOU IS
INTERESTING BUT WHAT THEYCONCEAL IS --

TO VISIT THEIR DOCTOR ANDPERHAPS HAVE THEIR MEDICATION
CHANGED.

DANGEROUS DRUGS MISLEAD DOCTORSAND PAY PEOPLE OFF, WHICH RAISES
THE QUESTION, WHY AM I (BLEEP)WITH THEM?
