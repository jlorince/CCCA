WHAT SPARKED THE YOUTH TO TAKETO THE STREETS AND TOPPLE DOWN
ESSENTIALLY MUBARAK AND HISMURDERERS WERE ACQUITTED OR
GIVEN A VERY WEAK SENTENCE.
THEY WERE RETRIED AFTER CREATINGSO MANY PRESSURES.
AT THE TRIAL BACK IN LATE 2013,THE ALEXANDRIA ACTIVISTS,
THEY WERE ROUNDED UP AND
SENTENCED UNDER THE ANTI-PROTEST LAW THAT THE GOVERNMENT
ENACTED LAST NOVEMBER.
UNDER THAT LAW IT PRETTY MUCH ISLEGAL JUSTIFICATION TO JUST KILL

THEY VILIFY THEM IN THE MEDIA ORDON'T DISCUSS THEM AT ALL AND
ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT THE FIRSTAND THE FOREMOST THING WE HAVE
