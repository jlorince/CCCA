>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A JOURNALIST
AND BEST SELLING AUTHOR.
HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE STATE
OF JONES.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW SALLY
JENKINS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
A FASCINATING BOOK.
THE STATE OF JONES ABOUT A
COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI THAT
ACTUALLY SECEDED FROM THE SOUTH
DURING THE CIVIL WAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVEN'T -- I
SAW ALL 18 HOURS OF BURNS
DOCUMENTARY ON THE CIVIL WAR BUT
I DON'T RECALL EVER HEARING
ABOUT THIS.
>> JONES COUNTY DIDN'T FORMALLY
SECEDE, THEY SECEDED
EFFECTIVELY.
IT WAS AN EMBARRASSING EPISODE.
HISTORIANS WROTE IT OUT OF
HISTORY AND WROTE THE MAN WHO
WROTE IT OUT OF HISTORY AS WELL.
IT WAS A DIRT FARM YERK
ANTISLAVERY, PROUNION LOYALIST
WHO WAS REGARDED AS A TRAITOR SO
THE SOUTH PREFERRED TO THINK HE
NEVER EXISTED.
>> Jon: HE DID JOIN THE
CONFEDERATE ARMY.
>> HE WAS DRAFTED, DESERTED
TWICE.
THE SECOND TIME FOR GOOD AND
WENT INTO THE SWAMPS WITH 125
MEN AND LED AN INSURRECTION AND
FOUGHT OFF THE ARMY.
HE WAS MORE BRAVE AFTER THE WAR
DURING RECONSTRUCTION, DURING
THE RACIAL TERRORS.
HE LIVED WAY FORMER SLAVE OWNED
BY HIS FAMILY.
>> Jon: HE HAD TWO FAMILIES A
WHITE FAMILY AND A BLACK FAMILY.
>> HE LIVES WITH RACH YALE
KNIGHT, THE FORMER SLAVE, RAISES
SEVERAL FAMILIES WITH HER.
HE FIGHTS OFF THE KKK AND
SURVIVES AN ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT.
>> Jon: CRAZY HOW MUCH OF
STORY IS VIGILANTES HARASSING
HIS RELATIVES.
THERE'S A STORY ABOUT HIS UFRPBG
WHO IS MUCH OLDER AND THEY SAY
TO HIS BROTHER, TELL US WHERE HE
IS OR WE'LL KILL YOUR UNCLE.
>> THE CONFED RACY WAS SENDING
UNITS INTO JONES COUNTY TO FLUSH
THEM OUT.
THEY WOULD CAPTURE RELATIVES
PARTICULARLY OLD MEN AND BOYS
AND THREATEN TO HANG THEM OR
EXECUTE THEM.
THEY HUNG SEVERAL -- THREE OR
FOUR YOUNG MEN FROM THE MAGNOLIA
TREES IN THE VICINITY INCLUDING
SOME OF NEWTON KNIGHT'S OLDER
RELATIVES SKWROFRPBLGT IT WAS
FASCINATING WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
HIS OLDER UNCLE.
>> HE HAD AN UNCLE CAPTURED BY
THE CONFEDCY.
THE COUSIN SITS ON A FENCE
DEBATING WHETHER TO COME IN AND
SURRENDER AND HE SAID MY OLD MAN
HAS LIVED LONG ENOUGH.
I HAVE A LONG LIFE TO LIVE.
HE GOES TO NEW ORLEANS AND
FORMERLY ENLISTED IN THE UNION
ARMY.
>> Jon: AND LETS THEM HANG HIS
UNCLE.
>> RIGHT.
AFTER THE WAR ACTUALLY, NEWTON
KNIGHT, THE MAN WHO HUNG SOME OF
HIS RELATIVES BECOMES GOVERNOR
OF MISSISSIPPI IN 1888 -- 1881.
>> Jon: DID HE RUN ON THAT
PLATFORM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK IT SPEAKS -- ULTIMATELY
THE STORY SPEAKS WELL OF THE
SOUTH AND SPEAKS ILL OF HOW MUCH
WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT IT IN THAT
IT TALKS ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THE CONFEDERACY WERE
ANTISLAVE, DIDN'T THINK IT
SHOULD HAPPEN.
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DIDN'T
AGREE WITH THE WAR OR SLAVERY.
>> HAD IS HE SESSION -- SECEDING
BEEN PUT TO A POPULAR VOTE IT
MAY NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
JONES COUNTY TURNS ON THE
CONSTITUENTS AND VOTES FOR IT
BECAUSE HE SIDES WITH THE
WEALTHY FARMERS WHO WANTED IT.
>> Jon: HOW DID THEY GET THE
CONFEDERATES TO FIGHT SO LONG,
SO HARD AND SO WELL.
>> THE SLAVE ECONOMY IN THE DEEP
SOUTH WAS BIGGER THAN THE
RAILROADS.
THEIR ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE AND THE
ENTIRE ECONOMY WAS AT STAKE P. A
TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI WAS THE
RICHEST IN AMERICA BY FAR.
THE PLANTERS WERE MUCH RICHER
THAN RAILROAD BARONS.
>> Jon: THIS STORY COMES OUT
WHEN THIS GUY IS AN OLD MAN.
A REPORTER THINKS TO HIMSELF YOU
KNOW WHO I WOULD LIKE TO TALK
TO.
>> HE WAS LEGENDARY IN THE DEEP
SOUTH.
NOT AN OBSCURE FIGURE IN THE
MISSISSIPPI.
A HARVARD EDUCATED EASTERN
REPORTER WORKING IN NEW ORLEANS
HEARD THIS STORY AND HE DECIDES
TO GO UP AND FIND HIM ON THE
HILLTOP WHERE HE IS LIVING AS A
SEMI RECLUSE WITH HIS BLACK
FAMILY.
NEWTON KNIGHT WAS INTERVIEWED BY
A NEWSPAPER MAN IN 1921.
WE HAVE THAT AND SEVERAL OTHER
DOCUMENTS WE CAN USE IN THE
BOOK.
MY PARTNER IS A HISTORY
PROFESSOR AT HARVARD.
HE MAINTAINS.
JOHN'S SPECIALTY -- HE IS A
BRILLIANT MAN WHO STUD CANNIES
AND LISTINGISTS MAINTAINS THAT
NEWTON KNIGHT WENT FARTHER THAN
A LOT OF NORTHERN AND
LISTINGISTS.
>> Jon: IT'S A FASCINATING
BOOK.
THE ONE BLUSH YOU CAN TAKE AWAY
FROM THIS IS SUCK ON THIS BURNS.
