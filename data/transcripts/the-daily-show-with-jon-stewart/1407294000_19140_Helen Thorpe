[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR.
HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "SOLDIERGIRLS: THE BATTLES OF THREE
WOMEN AT HOME AND AT WAR."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMHELEN THORPE.
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GREAT. HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> IT'S VERY NICE TO BE HERE.
THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
>> IT'S MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK.
"SOLDIER GIRLS."
YOU KNOW, WAR STORIES ARE SODIFFICULT TO TELL BENEATH THE
KIND OF THE TENT POST ORCARICATURED VISION...
>> YEAH.>> Jon: THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOR IT.
TO TELL THE STORY OF WOMEN ATWAR.
IT'S SUCH A DIFFERENT PLACE TOGO WITH IT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND IT REALLY, THE BOOKFEELS VERY FRESH IN THAT WAY.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
>> Jon: HOW LONG DID YOU FOLLOWAND HOW DID YOU CHOOSE THE WOMEN
THAT YOU FOLLOWED?
>> SO I MET THEM FIRST IN 2010.
AND AT THAT POINT THEY HADALREADY DONE TWO TOURS OF DUTY
AND WERE BACK.
AND I SPOKE TO THEM.
ACTUALLY, FOR FOUR YEARS.
THE WHOLE PROJECT TOOK FOURYEARS.
SO THEY WENT THROUGH HOURS ANDHOURS AND HOURS OF INTERVIEWS
WITH ME.
>> Jon: VERY REVEALING.BY THE WAY...
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THEIR COURAGE NOTONLY TO GO INTO THOSE WAR ZONES,
BUT IN THE WAY THEY DISCUSSTHEIR LIVES.
>> I THOUGHT THEY WEREINCREDIBLY BRAVE AND CANDID.
THEY SHARED WITH ME LETTERS ANDE-MAILS AND DIARIES, EVEN
THERAPY NOTES.
>> Jon: AND IT WAS INTERESTING,THEIR CHALLENGES WERE DIFFERENT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU HAD ONE WOMAN WHOHAD THREE CHILDREN...
>> RIGHT.>> Jon: ANOTHER WHO WAS SINGLE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: ANOTHER WHO WAS GOING TOBE A GRANDMOTHER.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: I MEAN, THERE WASA, EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL
KNEW EACH OTHER...>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THEY COMEFROM VERY DIFFERENT PLACES.
>> RIGHT, REALLY DIFFERENT LIFESTAGES.
SO I MET THE YOUNGEST OF THETHREE WOMEN FIRST.
HER NAME IN THE BOOK IS MICHELLEFISHER. AND UM...
>> Jon: WHICH IS NOT HER NAME INTHE WORLD.
>> IT'S NOT HER REAL NAME. SHEASKED FOR A PSEUDONYM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND ABOUT HALF THEINDIVIDUALS I INTERVIEWED
WANTED TO USE PSEUDONYMS. SOSHE, MICHELLE FISHER WAS 18 IN
THE SPRING OF 2001.
SHE DID NOT THINK OF HERSELF ASA SOLDIER OR SOMEBODY WHO WANTED
TO JOIN THE MILITARY, BUT HERMOM WAS ON AND OFF WELFARE AND
HER DAD WAS IN AND OUT OFPRISON, AND SHE REALLY WANTED TO
FIGURE OUT HOW COULD SHE GO TOCOLLEGE AND HAVE A DIFFERENT
KIND OF LIFE.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DO FACTORYWORK, WHICH IS WHAT WAS
AVAILABLE.
AND, SO SHE WALKED INTO THERECRUITING OFFICE FOR THE
NATIONAL GUARD AND SIGNED UPREALLY INTENDING TO BE A
PART-TIME SOLDIER.
AND THEN, WHEN SHE WAS INTRAINING, 9/11 HAPPENED, AND SHE
GOT RIGHT AWAY THAT HER LIFE WASGOING TO BE REALLY DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT WHAT WAS MOSTINTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS IN THE
BOOKS THAT I'VE READ ABOUT MALEEXPERIENCE IN WAR, THERE'S A
CERTAIN CAMARADERIE THAT YOUNEVER GET BENEATH, BUT THIS
OPENS UP A DOOR TO THEINTERACTION BETWEEN SOLDIERS
THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT ANDFRAUGHT WITH A LOT MORE
COMPLICATION...>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IN TERMS OFINTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
>> RIGHT.>> Jon: YOU KNOW, OUT OF
MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIPS,DRINKING.
LIKE, IT IS A LOT MORE...THERE'S A LOT MORE DEPTH TO IT.
>> SO THESE WOMEN WERE, YOUKNOW, DEPLOYED ON THESE MULTIPLE
LENGTHY DEPLOYMENTS, FIRST TOAFGHANISTAN, THEN TO IRAQ, AND
THE WORK THEY WERE DOING WASFIXING BROKEN AK-47S IN
AFGHANISTAN AS WEAPONS MECHANICSOR IN DESMA'S CASE, WHEN
SHE'S IN IRAQ, DRIVING A GUN TRUCK AT THE FRONT OF A
SUPPLY CONVOY. AND THEN TORELIEVE THE STRESS THAT THEY
WERE UNDER FROM THESE, YOU KNOW,LENGTHY DEPLOYMENTS AT
HOME, FEELING ISOLATED ANDLONELY TWO OF THE WOMEN DID
HAVE AFFAIRS WITH MEN WHO WEREMARRIED WHO WERE THEIR
COLLEAGUES, AND ONE WOMAN ENDSUP DRINKING.
SHE WANTS A COCKTAIL AT THE ENDOF EVERY DAY AND SHE ENDS UP
RELYING ON ALCOHOL TO SORT OFGET HER THROUGH THE DEPLOYMENT.
>> Jon: AND IT WAS INTERESTING,TOO, BECAUSE THEY WERE
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE A BIT OF ARARE COMMODITY OVER THERE,
SO THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT THEMALES ARE KIND OF
FIGHTING FOR THEIR ATTENTION...>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IN WAYS WANTED BUT ALSOUNWANTED,
AND IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY THEYHAVE IN HAVING TO NAVIGATE EVEN
FORGET ABOUT THEENEMY ENVIRONMENT...
>> RIGHT.>> Jon: THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT.
>> YEAH.
SO BECAUSE THEY'RE SERVING IN AMIXED-GENDER BATTALION, THE
RATIO IS LIKE 2-1 ROUGHLY INTHEIR OWN BATTALION,
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> MEN TO WOMEN.
BUT THEY'RE ON A MILITARY POSTALONGSIDE OF ALL-MALE
INFANTRY SOLDIERS OR FOREIGNSOLDIERS FROM DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALL MALE, SOTHE RATIO ON THE POST ITSELF IS
EVEN MORE SKEWED MANY MORE MENTO WOMEN, AND THEY ARE SCARCE
COMMODITY.
THE YOUNGEST IN THE BOOK, THEYOUNGEST WOMAN, MICHELLE, IS
FINDING THAT EVERYWHERE SHEGOES, THE MEN ARE READING THE
NAME TAG ON HER ARMY UNIFORM ANDCALLING OUT TO HER BY NAME AS IF
THEY KNOW HER, SO FROM THEMOMENT SHE LEAVES HER TENT UNTIL
SHE GETS BACK TO HER TENT ATNIGHT, IT'S NON-STOP ATTENTION.
AND THEN YOU HAVE DEBBIE, WHO IS30 YEARS OLDER, SHE'S IN HER
EARLY 50S, AND SHE'S LOOKING ONTHINKING, WOW, IT'S A LONG TIME
SINCE I GOT THAT KIND OFATTENTION AND SHE'S NOT GETTING
QUITE THAT SORT OF ATTENTION,AND YOU CAN SEE IT
FROM DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTSDEPENDING ON THEIR AGE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S,
THAT'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUTIT. AND IT GIVES A VIEW
ALMOST FROM A 180 OF WHAT WE'REACCUSTOMED TO.
AND, IT'S A VERY VALUABLEADDITION IN THAT WAY IT SEEMS.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WELL, THANK YOU FORCOMING ON.
>> PLEASURE. >> Jon: AND SHARING IT WITH US.
HAVE THE WOMEN READ IT? HAVETHEY?
>> I ACTUALLY GAVE THEM THEMANUSCRIPT BEFORE IT WAS
PUBLISHED SO THEY COULD READ IT.>> Jon: OH OK.
>> I WANTED... YOU KNOW, IT'SWORK OF JOURNALISM.
IT WASN'T LIKE AN AUTHORIZEDBIOGRAPHY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
>> Jon: SURE.>> BUT I WANTED THEM TO READ IT
AND KNOW WHAT WASCOMING OUT, AND I WANTED TO HEAR
THEIR THOUGHT, SO YEAH, THEYENDORSED THE PROJECT.
>> Jon: OH, THEY DID.
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY READ ITAND WENT LIKE, I WILL NEVER
SPEAK WITH YOU AGAIN.[LAUGHTER].
>> NO. THEY READ IT AND, THEYREAD IT AND EACH OF THEM HAD
SOME CONCERN ABOUT SOME FAMILYMEMBER WHERE THEY HAD TOLD ME
SOMETHING REVEALING ABOUT THEIRDAUGHTER OR THEIR BOYFRIEND...
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.>> AND THEN THEY WANTED
TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THEY SAID ALL THIS STUFFI TOLD
YOU ABOUT MYSELF, YEP, THAT'STHE WAY IT HAPPENED.
>> Jon: WOW.
THAT'S TERRIFIC.
DO YOU GUYS STILL GET TOGETHER?
>> YES. YES.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S NICE.
>> AND MICHELLE FISHER HAS ACRUSH ON YOU.
>> Jon: MICHELLE FISHER HAS ACRUSH ON ME?
>> YEAH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
