(BLEEP)ER!"
IRRITATING, ISN'T IT?
A LITTLE IRRITATING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOR TURN WE TURN TO SENIOR DAILY
SHOW CORRESPONDENT JESSICA
WILLIAMS.
JESSICA, AS SOMEONE WHO IS MORE
LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS
THAN I AM, DO YOU AGREE THAT
STOP AND FRISK GOES TOO FAR?
>> NO!
I AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER KELLY.
IF ANYTHING, STOP AND FRISK
DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH!
JOHN, PEOPLE NEED TO ACCEPT THIS
PROGRAM AS A FACT OF URBAN LIFE.
AND RIGHT NOW I'M STANDING IN
ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST
CRIME-RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOODS.
>> John: WHERE EXACTLY ARE
YOU, JESS?
>> I'M ON WALL STREET.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHAT?
YOU'RE ON WALL STREET?
>> YEAH, I'M ON WALL STREET.
THE WHITE BRONX, BUSINESS
HARLEM.
AND FRANKLY, JOHN, I DON'T FEEL
SAFE HERE.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE
POLICE DO THEIR FREAKING JOBS
AND START STOPPING PEOPLE DOWN
HERE.
>> John: THAT'S NOT FAIR.
THAT'S NOT FAIR, JESSICA.
YOU'RE CALLING FOR THE ARBITRARY
HARASSMENT OF ANYONE ON WALL
STREET.
>> NO, NO, NO.
JUST PEOPLE YOU SUSPECT TO BE
WHITE COLLAR CRIMINALS.
YOU KNOW, WALKING AROUND IN
TAILORED SUITS, SLICKED BACK
HAIR, ALWAYS NEED SUNSCREEN, IF
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
(LAUGHTER).
>> John: I DON'T LIKE THE
IMPLICATION THERE.
>> LOOK, I KNOW THIS ISN'T
COMFORTABLE BUT IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
WHITE-COLLAR CRIME MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T DRESS THAT WAY!
BOOM!
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
THAT'S RACIST.
JESSICA, THAT IS RACIST.
YOU'RE PROFILING WHITE MEN IN
SUITS.
I AM A WHITE MAN IN A SUIT.
>> HEY, IT'S OKAY.
I CAN SAY THAT.
SOME OF MY BEST FRIEND ARE WHITE
MEN IN SUIT.
>> John: THAT'S A FOUL.
>> THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH IT.
AND SURE, THE SYSTEM IS NOT
PERFECT.
90% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STOPPED
WON'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
BUT ISN'T IT WORTH A SLIGHT
INCONVENIENCE TO THEIR DAY IF IT
MEANS JUST STOPPING ONE
INVESTMENT BANK FROM BETTING
AGAINST THE SAME PRODUCT IT'S
SELLING?
>> John: NO, NO, JESSICA, CAN
I TELL YOU THIS?
YOU ARE MERELY PERPETUATE AGO
NEGATIVE STEREOTYPE.
THAT'S IGNORANCE.
THAT'S ALL THAT IS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> JOHN, I HATE TO SAY IT
BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN THEIR
NEIGHBORHOODS OR EXPERIENCE THE
PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO THEIR
LIVES.
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT, YOU
DON'T.
YOU DON'T.
>> BUT IT IS A HARD FACT THAT
WHITE-COLLAR CRIME IS
DISPROPORTIONATELY COMMITTED BY
PEOPLE FIT A SERB PROFILE.
>> John: HEY, HEY --
>> SO IF YOU'RE SAY WHITE UPPER
EAST SIDE BILLIONAIRE WITH TIES
TO THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY LIKE
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO ACCEPT GETTING ROUGHED UP
BY THE POLICE EVERY ONCE IN A
WHILE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY.
>> John: JESSICA WILLIAMS,
