[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]IT IS TIME ONCE AGAIN FOR OUR
BICENTENNIAL SEGMENT GOOD NEWSFROM AFGHANISTAN.
â™ª IN OUR LAST INSTALLMENT BACK IN
THE EARLY OTS, MUSIC HADJUST BEEN REALLOWED.
SO WHAT IS EVERYONE SMILINGABOUT IN AFGHANISTAN THESE DAYS?
>> DESPITE THREATS FROM THETALIBAN VOTERS IN AFGHANISTAN
TURN OUT IN DROVES THIS WEEKENDTO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT.
>> EARLIEST ESTIMATES PUT THENUMBER AT SEVEN MILLION OUT OF
12 MILLION ELIGIBLEVOTERS NEARLY 60%.
>> Jon: 60% THAT IS ADORABLE.
IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO OURLAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH
WAS AH --[LAUGHTER]
-- 54.9%.
WAIT THEY BEAT US?
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF THATWE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH FOR OUR
ELECTIONS. NOVEMBERIS NOTORIOUS FOR
THANKSGIVING PREPAND EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AND
OBVIOUSLY THE IN BETWEEN NATUREOF SEASON MAKES A
CHOICE OF LIGHT JACKET OR WARMERJACKET MORE COMPLICATED.
I ONLY ASSUME AFGHAN VOTERS HADAN EASIER RIDE IN LATE MARCH OR
EARLY APRIL. I MEAN IT'S THEIRSPRING BREAK FOR GOD'S SAKE.
>> IN JUST THE PAST WEEK, THETALIBAN STAGED FOUR ATTACKS
INCLUDING ONE ON THE ELECTIONCOMMISSION HEADQUARTERS.
>> Jon: AND?
>> THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATIONSAYS THERE WERE 140 ATTACKS OR
ATTEMPTED ATTACKS AND ALMOST1,000 POLLING STATIONS HAD TO BE
CLOSED FOR SECURITY REASONS.
ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX.
>> Jon: AND?
>> IN 2009 ABOUT 20% OF THEVOTES HAD TO BE DISCOUNTED
BECAUSE THEY WERECONSIDERED FRAUDULENT.
>> Jon: OKAY NOT THE IDEALCONDITIONS I'M SURE 60% MOST OF
THAT IS PROBABLYFRAUDULENT ANYWAY.
>> SO FAR WIDESPREAD ALLEGATIONSOF BALLOT STUFFING AND FRAUD
HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED.
PEOPLE HAVE UNTIL THE END OFTODAY TO REPORT
COMPLAINTS, BY THE WAY. ONE OFTHE MOST PREVALENT SO FAR
HAS TO SIMPLY DO WITH POLLINGSTATIONS RUNNING OUT OF BALLOTS.
>> Jon: NOT ONLY THAT BUTAPPARENTLY THE FOX NEWS
AFFILIATE IN KABUL REPORTED THATA BLACK PANTHER WAS TRYING TO
INTIMIDATE WHITE VOTERS OUTSIDEOF THE POLLING STATION.
[LAUGHTER]WOW.
SEVEN MILLION AFGHAN CITIZENSIGNORED DEATH THREATS FROM THE
TALIBAN TO GET TO THE POLLS.
I CANNOT IMAGINE THE GARGANTUANBALLS THAT THESE GUYS MUST HAVE.
>> A THIRD OF THE VOTERS THATLINED UP AT THE POLLING STATIONS
YESTERDAY WERE WOMEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: YOU KNOW IT -- IT
OCCURS TO ME WE NEED TO MAYBECOME UP WITH A BETTER TERM TO
DESCRIBE BALLS THAN BALLS.

ESTRICLES.
ANYWAY, IT'S GREAT THE ELECTIONWENT SO WELL IN THE FACE OF SO
MANY ODDS BUT LET'S BE HONESTTHEY ARE JUST GOING TO ELECT
HAMID KARZAI'S PUPPET CANDIDATE.YOU KNOW HOW THESE THINGS WORK.
