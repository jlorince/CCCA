JUST LIKE YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
I AM ABOUT TO DO THE WORST
SEGUE IN THE HISTORY OF THE
SHOW.
SPEAKING OF CREATURES THAT
AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT JEWS OR
WATER--
(LAUGHTER)
WE REWRITE THE SHOW RIGHT
BEFORE THE SHOW.
SO SOMETIMES WE SCREW UP.
HERE'S A LITTLE STORY FROM A
SMALL TOWN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,
THE TOWN OF MOUNT VERNON NEW
HAMPSHIRE VOTES TO CHANGE
THE CONTROVERSIAL NAME OF A
POND.
FOR DECADES IT'S BEEN NAMED
JEW POND.
>> JEW POND.
>> THIS IS JEW POND.
>> Jon: AH, YES.
>> I I SOMEONE IS CATCHING
TADPOLES ON JEW POND.
JUST ME, SAL, IRVING,
MORTGAGEY AND WHO COULD
FORGETTESTER.
JEW POND, IT'S NOT STINGY
WITH THE MEMORIES, I'LL TELL
YOU THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THEY SAY JEW POND HAS A
DARK SIDE.
LEGEND HAS IT THE POND'S
INHABITED BY STRANGE AND
SOMEWHAT NEUROTIC MYTHICAL
CREATURE.
(LAUGHTER)
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SWIM IN
ANY POND THAT WOULD HAVE ME
THIS MONSTER.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT I ACTUALLY, I
DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO
CONCLUSIONS.
MAYBE JEW POND-- MAYBE JEW
POND ISN'T REALLY NAMED
OFFENSIVELY.
MAYBE IT'S JUST A SHORTENED
VERSION OF THE NAME OF AN
INDIAN TRIBE KNOWN FOR ITS
ANTI-SEMITISM.
OR MAYBE THERE'S AN INNOCENT
EXPLANATION.
>> IT GOT ITS NAME BACK IN
THE '20s AFTER TWO JEWISHMEN
BOUGHT A NEARBY HOTEL AND
THE POND THAT CAME ALONG
WITH IT KNOWN AT THE TIME OF
SPRINGTIME.
>> DURING THAT PERIOD,
SOMEONE IN TOWN APPARENTLY
COINED THE PHRASE JEW POND.
>> Jon: OKAY THEN.
SO IT WAS NAMED BECAUSE IT
WAS BOUGHT BY A COUPLE OF
JEWS.
BUT AT LEAST THE TOWNS FOLK
ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT'S
KIND OF OFFENSIVE.
>> IT'S NOT OFFENSIVE TO ME.
>> I REALLY DON'T FIND IT
OFFENSIVE AT ALL.
>> DOESN'T OFFEND ME.
>> WHY CHANGE SOMETHING,
BEEN THAT WAY FOREVER.
>> Jon: WELL, NOT FOREVER.
JUST SINCE TWO JEWS BOUGHT
IT.
THEN TUESDAY NIGHT MOUNT
VERNON VOTERS WANT TO THE
POLL.
>> THE TOWNS PEOPLE CAST
THEIR VOTE BY SECRET BALLOT.
THE RESULT, 104 TO 33 IN
FAVOR OF A NAME CHANGE.
>> AS OF RIGHT NOW THE TOWN
HAS NOT AGREED ON A NEW NAME
YET.
>> Jon: OH, BUT THEY DO HAVE
SEVERAL WORKING PROPOSALS
INCLUDING KIKE'S CREEK.
(LAUGHTER)
MEL'S BROOK.
AND INTERNATIONAL BANKING
