DO YOU EVER WONDER, DO YOU EVER
COME TO A TAPING AND WONDER, ARE
THERE GUESTS YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE
ON THE SHOW BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE
TO BOOK FOR ONE REASON OR
ANOTHER?
AS IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE.
TONIGHT I'VE LIKE TO OFFER ONE
SUCH RELUCK TANTS GUEST A SPOT
ON THIS PROGRAM WITH OUR NEW
SEGMENT -- REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT?
IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE'RE...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN
OVER THIS BEFORE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING
BECAUSE IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER
WAY WE RUN SUCH A TIGHT SHIP.
THIS SEEMS LIKE AN EGREGIOUS
OVERSIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
TONIGHT I'D LIKE TO DEBUT OUR
SEGMENT BY ASKING, PRESIDENT
GEORGE W. BUSH TO COME -- I
THINK... I THINK IT'S A MOMENTUM
KILLER.
MR. PRESIDENT, I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU ARE ON A BOOK TOUR TO
PROMOTE YOUR NEW BOOK... OOPS,
JON STEWART WAS RIGHT, I WAS NOT
A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT.
THAT'S NOT... DAMN YOU, PROPS
DEPARTMENT.
SABOTEURS.
LOOK, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE
DOING A HUGE BOOK TOUR.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE
APPEARING ON NBC, CBS,
SYNDICATION, FOX, FOX, FOX AND
FOX AND MORE FOX.
YOU GET THE POINT.
WHY NO LOVE?
WHY NO LOVE?
WAS IT THE EIGHT YEARS OF
NON-STOP MOCKING?
( LAUGHTER )
THE EGREGIOUS OVERUSE OF CLIPS
SUCH AS, I DON'T KNOW, THIS ONE.
♪♪
♪♪
GOLD!
IT'S GOLD, JERRY!
WAS IT MY DEVASTATINGLY SPOT-ON
IMPRESSIONS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY CLOSED THEIR EYES AND IT
WAS LIKE YOU WERE IN THE ROOM
WITH US.
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO, THIS IS FOR REAL,
YOU COME ON THE SHOW, THAT
IMPRESSION GONE!
IN FACT, I'LL CHANGE IT,
RECASTING YOU FROM A SMALL-TOWN
DEPUTY SHERIFF/PAUL LYNN
CHARACTER TO A MORE HEROIC,
GLORIOUS FIGURE.
"I'M THE DECIDER, HO, HO, HO,
AH."
NO?
NOTHING?
I CAN SEE WHY YOU WERE A TWO
TERMER.
SO I'M WILLING TO THROW IN, IF
YOU COME ON THIS PROGRAM,
COMPLIMENTARY SET OF STEAK
KNIVES.
TO BE USED ON THE STEAK OF YOUR
CHOICE.
OBVIOUSLY THE STEAK WILL NOT BE
INCLUDED AND YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY
FOR SHIPPING, BUT MY POINT IS
THIS: I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.
STEELY RESOLVEMENT I'M STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE JUAREZ
LUCIENS -- THE WAR RESOLUTIONS
GOT THROUGH CONGRESS WITH SUCH
EASE.
I KNOW YOU LOVE YOU SOME GOOD
TEXAS-STYLE BARBECUE.
THERE IS A LEGENDARY BARBECUE
SANDWICH, A BONELESS RIB
SANDWICH VIRTUALLY WATER BOARDED
IN DELICIOUS SAUCE THAT STILL
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO RETAIN ITS
BONE-LIKE SHAPE.
NOW, THIS DELICIOUS SANDWICH WAS
DISCONTINUED IN 1994 DUE TO
SOME, SAY, MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF
WHAT CONSTITUTES FOOD.
BUT A MEDALSOME GOVERNMENT
CANNOT STOP ME, MR. PRESIDENT.
BEFORE THEY WERE DISCONTINUED, I
STOCKPILED AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT
OF THESE DELICIOUS SANDWICHES IN
A SPECIALLY DESIGNED HYPERBARIC
CHAMBER THAT LOCKED IN... I'M
KIDDING.
I LEFT THEM IN MY MINIVAN, WHICH
FOR THE MOST PART WAS UNDERNEATH
MY CART PORT.
HERE IT IS, THE VINTAGE 1994
McRIB IN, WHAT I THINK... CAN
WE GET A SHOT OF THAT?
IN WHAT YOU WILL AGREE IS
BIZARRELY MINT CONDITION.
WHAT WOULD THIS FETCH AT
AUCTION?
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MONEY.
THIS IS PRICELESS.
AND IT'S YOURS IF YOU COME, IF
YOU ARE A GUEST ON THIS PROGRAM.
( LAUGHTER )
UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
TO GET YOUR HANDS ON A McRIB
THAN... WHAT'S THAT?
ON NOVEMBER 2nd THEY?
MOTHER [BLEEPED].
I AM SO ANGRY/EXCITED AND
HUNGRY.
DAMMIT.
WELL, ANYWAY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU
HAVE MY NUMBER, OR AT LEAST
PASSED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION
THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO GET
