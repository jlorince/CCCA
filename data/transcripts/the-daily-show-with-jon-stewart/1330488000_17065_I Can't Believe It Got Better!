THAT GUY MAKES IT WAY TOO
(bleep) EASY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.
OF COURSE, THE MAIN STORY
TONIGHT THE ECONOMY.
THE DOW CLOSED ABOVE 13,000 FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR YEARS
TODAY.
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
ARBITRARY INDICATOR MAKING A
MOVE THIS FIRST FEBRUARY.
>> A WHOLE SLEW OF GOOD NEWS
ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND A
RECORD-SETTING DAY ON WALL
STREET.
THE JOBLESS RATE IN JANUARY FELL
TWO TENTHS OF A POINT TO 8.3%,
THE LOWEST IN THREE YEARS.
THE ECONOMY CREATED $243,000
JOBS.
THE DOW SOARED TO THE HIGHEST
CLOSE SINCE BEFORE THE 2008
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
>> Jon: YOU HAD TO GO AND GET
BETTER WHILE OBAMA WAS STILL IN
OFFICE, DIDN'T YOU?  YOU
COULDN'T HOLD OFF NINE LITTLE
MONTHS.
NOT TEENY TINY LITTLE MONTHS.
IT'S GOOD NEWS UNLESS YOU WORK
FOR A MEDIA ORGANIZATION WHOSE
JOB IT IS TO MAKE SURE OBAMA
DOESN'T GET REELECTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
TO THE RETURN-A NATEOR.
>> IT'S AN ANEMIC RECOVERY.
>> THERE AIN'T NO RECOVERY.
>> ABOUT HALF THE DECLINE IN THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS COME FROM
PEOPLE DROPPING OUT OF WORK
FORCE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO
DISCOURAGED.
THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS
WELL INTO THE DOUBLE DIGITS.
THE ECONOMIC DATA OBAMA IS
PEDALING IS -- PEDDLING IS
PHONY.
>> IT'S HOW YOU FEEL IN THE
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE
ELECTION REGARDLESS OF NUMBERS,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: LET ME SEE IF I GET
THIS STRAIGHT, THE NUMBERS ARE
REAL BUT THEY ARE NOT G. IN
FACT, THEY ARE BAD.
ACTUALLY THEY ARE FAKE.
EVEN IF THEY WERE REAL AND GOOD
IT WOULDN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT'S
ABOUT HOW BAD YOU FEEL AND
THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.

FOX NEWS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THEIR EARLY FEBRUARY
PUSHBACK ON THE ECONOMIC
INDICATORS IS ALL OVER THE
PLACE.
YOU RARELY SEE FOX THIS
DISORGANIZED.
LUCKILY ON FEBRUARY 10th THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
SENT OUT THIS PUNDIT PREP
DOCUMENT, LET ME SHOW IT TO YOU.
IT'S A DOCUMENT EMPHASIZING HOW
TO MITIGATE ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY
BE OCCURRING FROM THE IMPROVED
ECONOMY.
IT FURNISHES REPUBLICAN PUNDITS
WITH THREE KEY AREAS TO FOCUS
ON, THE NATIONAL DEBT,
UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PRICE OF
GAS.
LET'S WATCH AND SEE IF THE
FEBRUARY 10th PLANTING TAKES
ROOT.
FUR PLAYING ALONG AT HOME AND
LOOKING FOR NATIONAL DEBT,
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE PRICE OF
GAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THE DEBT IS THE ISSUE.
>> WHY ISN'T THE NATIONAL DEBT
THE MAIN ISSUE?
>> RISING UNEMPLOYMENT.
THE COUNTRY IS DEEPER IN DEBT.
>> 15% U6 UNEMPLOYMENT.
>> 8.5 UNEMPLOYMENT AND FOUR
BUCKS FOR GAS.
>> NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT GAS
PRICES YNCH IS NOBODY TALKING
ABOUT THIS.
>> $3.57 AND YOU MIGHT BE ASKING
THE QUESTION WHY IS NOBODY
TALKING ABOUTÑi THIS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: BINGO!
I HAVE MY WHOLE -- WHY IS NOBODY
TALKING ABOUT THIS?
OH, MY GOD GRETCHEN IS UNABLE TO
HEAR HER OWN VOICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS SO TRAGIC.
FOR HER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO A LOT OF PUNDITS -- A LOT OF
PUNDITS AND NEWS SHOWS ON FOX
SEEM TO HAVE CONSOLIDATED THEIR
NEGATIVE ECONOMIC SPIN AROUND
THE SAME THREE DISTINCT DATA
POINTS PROVIDED BY THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
PUNDIT PREP NOTE.
THAT'S NOT PROOSM YOU DON'T HAVE
ONE OF FOX'S TALKING HEADS, I
DON'T KNOW READING THE MEMO
ALOUD MUCH TO THE CHA GRIN OF
ONE OF THE TALKING HEADS SITTING
NEXT TO THEM, DO WE?
>> THE RNC SEES TROUBLE FOR THE
PRESIDENT REGARDING THIS.

HEADS TO GOOD OUT.
THEY SAY THE THREE BEST WAYS TO
DEFINE THE BARACK OBAMA ECONOMY,
THE NATIONAL DEBT, WHICH IS
SKYROCKETING, THE UNEMPLOYMENT
WHICH IS NORTH OF 8% AND GAS
PRICES.
>> Jon: FASCINATING.
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE MR. DOOCY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THE PIVOT
FROM REVEALING THE GAME TO
PLAYING IT?
>> AND GAS PRICES.
>> THEY ARE IMPACTING YOU.
HOW HAS IT AFFECTED YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING WITHOUT?
E-MAILzV US, WE WOULD LIKE TO
KNOW.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT'S LIKE HOSTING A SHOW WITH
A LAB WHEN THIS GUY IS ON THERE.
HE JUST GAVE THE GAME AWAY.
YOU KNOW, THEY SENT UP A TALKING
POINT WHICH BRINGS UP A POINT
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.
THAT RUINS THE GAME  IT'S LIKE
SECOND AN E-MAIL TO SOMEONE
THATS SAYS HEY CLICK ON THIS, IT
OPENS UP A VIDEO OF RICK ASTLEY
SING" NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP"
WHICH UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT TO GET.

TALKING HEADS TO GO OUT.
