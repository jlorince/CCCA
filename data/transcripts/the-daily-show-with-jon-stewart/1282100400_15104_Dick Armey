I'M EXCITED WHICH IS --
>> THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.
LOOK AT THAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I THINK THEY DON'T DO
WELL WITH PEOPLE WITH REALLY
LONG FACES.
>> YOU ARE REALLY DOING WELL.
>> Jon: IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO
DRAW MORE ATTENTION TO MY GIANT,
RIDICULOUS HEAD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
VERY KIND OF YOU.
>> SOME ARE SAYING YOU ARE ALL
HORSE AND NO CATTLE, AT LEAST I
KNOW YOU GOT THE HAT.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO LIKE THAT
UP, SIR.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT NICE BUT I'M
GOING TO LOOK IT UP.
>> TURN IT OVER.
>> Jon: YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED
TO PUT IT ON THE THING?
>> LORD HAVE MERCY, NO.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO TAUNT YOU
NOW.
YOU DO IT LIKE THIS?
WHY DO YOU --
>> THAT'S THE WAY YOU --
>> Jon: I LIVE IN NEW YORK
CITY.
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO SAY OH, A
HOMELESS PERSON.
MONEY OR GOD FORBID BODILY
FLUIDS INTO MY HAT.
>> THE MONEY IS ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: I'LL DO THAT IT'S A
REAGAN HAT.
I'M EXCITED.
>> THAT ACTUALLY HAT WAS MADE
FOR RONALD REAGAN.
>> Jon: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
>> READ IT.
IT SAYS --
>> Jon: MR. GORBACHEV --
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU DID WELL.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS OF:"
GIVE US LIBERTY."
IT'S A MANIFESTO CLOSE TO KARL
MRAX THERE.
>> I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT.
>> Jon: LOWER TAXES PLUS LESS
GOVERNMENT EQUALS MORE FREEDOM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE THING
THERE.
IT WOULD LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT
FOR MAXIMUM FREEDOM, YOU WOULD
WANT NO TAXES AND NO GOVERNMENT.
HOW CLOSE AM I TO WHAT --
[LAUGHTER]
>> ACTUALLY YOU ARE REALLY
BORDERING ON WHAT IS CALLED THE
ARMEY CURVE.
THERE'S A QUESTION AND IT'S
ADDRESSED IN DEBATE ACROSS THE
WORD.
>> Jon: AND THAT THE LAFFER
CURVE?
>> THAT IS OLD FASHIONED.
THIS IS GOOD STUFF.
>> Jon: THE ARMEY CURVE.
IT'S A BETTER KNOW.
NO LAUGHING AT THE ARMEY CURVE.
>> Jon: NO.
>>
[LAUGHTER]
>> IF YOU HAVE AND ACEH THEN --
ANARCHY THEN YOU'VE GOT A MESS.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> IF YOU LISTEN TO THE SMALL
GOVERNMENT CONSTITUTIONAL SMALL
GOVERNMENT FOLKS THAT MAKE UP
THIS MOVEMENT, WHAT THEY ARE
SAYING IS WE ALL UNDERSTAND WE
DESPERATELY NEED A GOOD
GOVERNMENT THAT CLEARLY FOCUSES
ON THOSE THINGS GOVERNMENTS MUST
DO AND DO THOSE THINGS WELL AND
COST EFFECTIVELY.
BUT OUR PROBLEM WITH
GOVERNMENT'S DON'T ALWAYS DO THE
THICKS THEY SHOULD DO WELL, AND
THEY MESS IN OTHER THINGS.
ARMEY'S AXE YOM IS DIVISIONAL
LABOR WORKS BEST WHEN PEOPLE
MIND THEIR OWN DAMN BUSINESS.
THE PROBLEM WITH GOVERNMENT IS
THEY DON'T MIND THEIR OWN DAMN
BUSINESS.
WRITE THAT DOWN.
>> Jon: THOSE SEEM LIKE
COMPETING IDEAS.
>> NO, NO.
IT'S THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING
IN THE WORLD.
IF YOU AND I WERE LEFT ON A
DESERT ISLAND.
>> Jon: HOW WOULD THAT HAPPEN?
WHY?
WAIT.
ALL RIGHT WE'RE LEFT ON A DESERT
ISLAND.
>> TAKE DELIVERY LESSONSONS FROM
TOM HANKS.
BAM.
THE TWO OF US AND A UPS PACKAGE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> ONE OF US IS GOING TO BE THE
GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: HOW TALL ARE YOU?
>> I'M GOING HAVE A GUN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> I'M A SECOND AMENDMENT GUY,
YOU KNOW THAT.
>> Jon: HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'M GOING TO HAVE A BOAT.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> I WANTED YOU TO --
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> ANYWAY, THE QUESTION IS:  THE
QUESTION IS BEING ADDRESSED
QUITE SERIOUSLY.
HAS BEEN ADDRESSED.
WAS ADDRESSED IN THE CONTINENTAL
CONGRESS:  WHAT IS THE
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE
GOVERNMENT AND WHAT ARE THE
NECESSARY TASKS THAT WE ASSIGN
TO THE GOVERNMENT?
AND HOW DO WE RESTRAIN
GOVERNMENT FROM OVERSTEPPING IT?
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SOMETHING
THAT YOU AND I AS PRIVATE
CITIZENS DO NOT HAVE WHICH IS
THE POWER TO COMPEL PEOPLE TO DO
WHAT THEY WILL NOT OTHERWISE DO?
HOW DO YOU CONSTRAIN GOVERNMENT?
THE GREAT CONSTRAINT AGAINST
EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT IS OUR
CONSTITUTION.
I LIKE TO REMIND OFFICE
HOLDERS -- THERE'S NOT AN
OFFENSE HOLDER IN AMERICA TODAY
THAT DOESN'T TAKE A SINGULAR
OATH OF OFFENSE:  PROTECT AND
DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.
WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S A MARVELOUS
BLUEPRINT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT IS THE STRUCTURE OF
DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES,
AUTHORITIES, PREROGATIVES
BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
>> Jon: NOBODY IS ARGUING THAT
THE CONSTITUTION IS NOT GOOD.
>> OH...
>> Jon: THE IDEA IS AND THIS
IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE
ROAD.
YOU ARE DESCRIBING A REASONABLE
SET OF CHECKS AND BALANCES BUT
YOU'VE BRING A MANIFESTO THAT
SAYS JOIN THE REVOLUTION.
IT SPEAKS AS IF -- HAVE WE
MISAPPROPRIATED.
THE TEA PARTY WAS ABOUT TAXATION
WITHOUT REPUTATION.
THEY'VE GOTTEN THE TAXATION PART
BUT DO THEY UNDERSTAND WE HAVE
REPRESENTATION?
ARE WE LOSING YOUR VERY COGENT
AND I THOUGHT VERY BALANCED
ARGUMENT WITH THIS IDEA OF WE'RE
FIGHTING TYRANNY TO TAKE BACK
OUR GOVERNMENT.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THESE FOLKS
AND GO WALK AMONG THEM.
>> Jon: WHAT AMONG THEM?
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU PHOESY
FOR GOD SAKES?
I HAVE WALKED AMONG THESE
PEOPLE.
I HAVE SEEN.
>> TRUST ME.
>> Jon: I GET.
>> THE THE FIRST SOURCE OF
HEARTBURN IS TARP.
>> Jon: WELL, NOW THAT'S NOT
THE GARDEN OF EDEN OTHER SIN.
TARP IS -- WE'RE A LONG WAY DOWN
THE ROAD.
>> WHAT CAUSED THESE FOLKS TO
SAY HEY, YOU KNOW LIKE POPEYE I
HAVE ALL I CAN STAND I CAN
STANDS NO MORE.
I'LL GET OUT IN THE VOTES AND
LET PEOPLE KNOW I'M NOT HAPPY
WITH GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: A DEMOCRAT GOT
ELECTED.
>> NO ABSOLUTELY NOT.
>> Jon: HOWDY PARTNER IT WAS A
WEIRD EDIT LIKE THE WHOLE THING
STOPPED ABRUPTLY.
IT'S ALL ON THE WEB, PARTNER.
I DIDN'T WANT TO CUT IT UP AND
MAKE IT SOUND STUPID SO WATCH
THE REST
