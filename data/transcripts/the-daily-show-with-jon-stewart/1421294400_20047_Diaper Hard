>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
NOW BEFORE THE BREAK WEEXAMINED THE COMPLEXITIES OF
FREE SPEECH IN A STORY THATIS DIFFICULT, CONFUSING AND
VERY EMOTIONAL. BUT IT ISIMPORTANT TO FOE FREE SPEECH
NEEDN'T BE USED JUST TOADVANCE AN IMPORTANT CAUSE.
SOMETIMES YOU CAN EVEN WAITTHAT VALUABLE RESOURCE
SQUANDERING SEVERAL MINUTESON IT ON A NATIONAL PLATFORM
IN SERVICE OF STUPIDITY,JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL LAKE
THAT STUPIDITY WILL CHEERYOU UP AND YOU NEED TO
PRESERVE AT TIMES YOURHEART AND SOUL.
AND SO I PRESENT TO YOU OURSECOND ACT.
>> POPE FRANCIS WILL HEADTO THE PHILIPPINES ON THURSDAY.
>> THIS IS EXPECTED TO BETHE LARGEST GATHERING OF
CATHOLICS IN THE WORLD.
>> THE HEAD OF THE METRODEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY WANTS
TO MAKE SURE STREETS DON'TGET GRIDLOCKED IF A TRAFFIC
ENFORCER HAS TO GO TO THEBATHROOM.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MAKINGTHEM WEAR DIAPERS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU HEARD RIGHT.
SO LARGE AND UNNAVIGABLEWILL THE CROWDS BE WHEN POPE
FRANCIS VISITS THE PHILIPPINES, AUTHORITIES IN THE CAPITAL ARE
HAVING THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENTOFFICERS WEAR DIAPERS.
NOW I GET WHERE THEY AREPROTESTING IT THE POLICE
WITH THOSE I CAN'T BREATHET-SHIRTS.
THE ROUGHEST PART FOR THEOFFICERS ISN'T SO MUCH
WEARING THE DIAPER IS GOINGBACK TO THE STATION AND ASKING
YOUR BOSS TO CHANGE YOU.
JOHNSON, IN MY OFFICE.
I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR BADGEAND YOUR BOOM BOOM.
WHY SUCH DRASTIC MEASURES?
>> TRAFFIC COPS ARECONSIDERING USING ADULT
DIAPERS BECAUSE THERE'S ASHORTAGE OF PORTABLE TOILETS.
>> WELL NOT FOR NOTHING, BUT INA PAPAL CROWD SITUATION, WERE
DIAPERS THE FIRST SOLUTION?
MAYBE OFFICERS COULD WEARSHIFTS OR I DON'T KNOW,
FRANCIS IS A MAN OF THEPEOPLE.
ALL THE MORE NOT TO HAVE HISAUDIENCE UNCOMFORTABLE SO TO
SPEAK.
PERHAPS HE COULD ADD ASECOND SHOW.
I MEAN, THE GUY'S INFALLIBLE,IT'S NOT INFLEXIBLE.
LET'S GO TO OUR SENIORPAPAL CORRESPONDENT JASON
JONES. HE'S IN MANILA WITH MORE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JON.
MANILA'S PREPARATIONS AREJUST THE LATEST SIGN OF POPE
FRANCIS'S ENORMOUSPOPULARITY HERE.
>> Jon: JASON, IF I COULDINTERRUPT YOU FOR A MOMENT.
>> WHY DOW ALWAYS INTERRUPT,WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DO YOU
WANT?
WHAT'S UP?
>> Jon: I CAN'T HELP NOTICETHAT YOU YOURSELF ARE
WEARING-- ARE WEARING ADIAPER.
>> NOTHING GETS BY THE BIGBOSSMAN, HUH?
>> Jon: I APPRECIATE THAT BUT ITHINK THAT WAS MEANT FOR THE
TRAFFIC POLICE.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, BETTERSAFE THAN SORRY, RIGHT?
REPORTERS CREED.
>> Jon: I ALSO THINK-- IALSO THINK THE MORE COMMON
INTERPRETATION WAS THAT YOUWHAT WEAR PANTS ON TOP OF
THE DIAPERS.
>> WHAT, AND HAVE A VISIBLEPAMPER LINE? NO THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THE POINT IS THIS,THE POPE ISN'T EVEN IN
MANILA YET AND SO THE WHOLEDIAPER THING AT BEST SEEMS
PREMATURE.
>> WELL, THAT'S JUST ALITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING.
I REALLY THOUGHT EVERYONEWAS-- YOU KNOW, WALKING
AROUND IF DIAPERS.

>> Jon: JASON, YOU'RE NOTONE OF THEM MAN BABIES WE
READ ABOUT, ARE YOU?
>> WHAT, THAT IS ABSOLUTELYRIDICULOUS AND OFFENSIVE,
OKAY.

>> Jon: JASON, JASON -- YOU'RE AGROWN MAN.
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN, JASON.
I KNOW YOU HAVE A SENSE OFOBJECT PERMANCE, I KNOW IT.
>> IT'S LATE, JON.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THATIS GOING TO CONSOLE ME NOW.
