>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE AUTHOR MR.MALCOLM GLADWELL WILL
BE JOINING US TONIGHT.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THEFALLOUT OF GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
AND A LOOK AT THE TRUEVICTIMS.
NO, NOT THE FAMILIES THAT RELYON HEADSTART.
NO, NOT CANCER PATIENTS WHOSETREATMENT WAS DELAYED THAT'S
SO -- NO!
NOT THOSE FAME-WHORE PANDA CAMPANDAS.
LOOK AT ME I'M NIBBLING ONBAMBOO.
[ LAUGHTER ](bleep) BUT THE REAL VICTIMS
OF THE SHUTDOWN THERE WE GO.
>> 28%.
THAT'S HOW MANY VOTERS NOW SAYTHEY HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT IS THEIT IS THE LOWEST
SCORE EVERRECORDED FOR EITHER PARTY BY
GALLUP. POLITICS IS LIKE GOLFRIGHT. THE LOWER THE SCORE THE
BETTER.
>> WHEN YOU SHUT DOWN THEGOVERNMENT FOR TWO WEEKS IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN NOTHING PEOPLEDON'T LIKE IT.
IT HURTS THE REPUBLICAN BRAND.
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT SOMEESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE
SOUNDING THE ALARM SAYING THETEA PARTY GROUPS TACTICS ARE A
TAD EXTREME.
>> YOU CANNOT GOVERN FROM ONEPART OF ONE-HALF OF CONGRESS.
THE ONLY OUT IS FOR THESE PEOPLETO REALIZE THEY ARE IN A SUICIDE
CAUCUS.
>> Jon: THEY ARE NOT IN ASUICIDE CAUCUS.
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I FOUNDEDSUICIDE CAUCUS IN 1983.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WAS MY SPEED PUNK SKA JAZZ.
FUSION BAND. [ LAUGHTER ]>> SUICIDE CAUCUS.
AND I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW THEMAGAZINE ROLLING STONE CALLED US
ALSO PERFORMING.
[ LAUGHTER ]I APPARENTLY HAD TO URINATE
DURING THAT SET.
[LAUGHTER]THAT GETS US TO THE DILEMMA THAT
THE REPUBLICAN ELITE ARE FACING.
THEY WANT TO LET THE TEA PARTYKNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO CALL THE SHOTS.
THEY SURE WERE EXCITED A FEWYEARS BACK WHEN THE TEA PARTY
SHOWED UP.
>> THE BIG SPLIT BETWEEN THEESTABLISHMENT AND THE NEW
PEOPLE, THE TEA PARTY FOLKS ISVASTLY EXAGGERATED.
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELYHARMONIOUS.
I THINK OVERALL IT'S ATREMENDOUS ASSET FOR THE
REPUBLICANS.
IT'S THE PARTY THAT HAS ASTRUCTURE ABSORBING THE ENERGY
OF THESE SPONTANEOUSDEMONSTRATORS.
>> THEY WANTED THE ENERGY.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> THE REPUBLICAN -- THE PARTY
WANTED TO ABSORB THE TEA PARTYENERGY TO SWALLOW AND DIGEST THE
TEA PARTY'S ENTHUSIASM ANDPASSION SO LONG AS THE TEA PARTY
PROMISED NOT TO BURST THROUGHTHEIR CHEST AND REPLICATE --
BURST THROUGH THEESTABLISHMENT'S CHEST THEY --
