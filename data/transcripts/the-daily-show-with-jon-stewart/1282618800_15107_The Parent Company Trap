HIS HAND.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, MY
WEEKEND.
AND WHY IT TOOK ME AN HOUR AND
15 MINUTES TO GET A CUP OF
COFFEE AND A BAGEL ON SUNDAY
MORNING.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
>> DUELING PROTESTS THIS MORNING
NEAR GROUND ZERO.
>> SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF
THE PROJECT ARE BOTH STAGING
RALLIES TODAY.
>> NO MOSQUE HERE!
NO MOSQUE HERE!
>> THERE IS A BAGEL HERE, SO I
UNDERSTAND YOU ARE BOTH VERY
ANGRY.
I JUST WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
MAKE... MY SON ACTUALLY LOVES
STRUDEL.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE THAT WAS A CROWD
SHOUTING AT A RANDOM GROUND ZERO
CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHO HAPPENED
TO BE WALKING BY WEARING A
SKULLCAP.
EMOTIONS WERE HIGH, BUT WHY WAS
EVERYONE SO SUSPICIOUS?
>> WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING
FROM?
>> WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET
THE $100 MILLION FROM.
>> WE'RE FOLLOWING THE MONEY
TRAIL.
WHERE IS THIS MONEY COMING FROM?
>> THIS GUY HAS QUESTIONABLE
TIES.
>> HERE'S THE ONE WE SHOULD ALL
REALLY WORRY ABOUT.
WHERE IS IRAN IN THIS?
>> Jon: A MUSLIM GUILT BY
ASSOCIATION GAME.
LAST WEEK WE CALLED IT SIX
DEGREES OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T EAT
BACON.
YOU CAN USE THE SAME LOGIC TO
USE FOX NEWS WITH DANGEROUS
SAUDI MONEY SINCE THE LARGEST
NEWS CORPS SHARE SHOULDER IS A
SAUDI PRINCE.
IT'S A STUPID AND CHILDISH GAME
I WAS PLAYING.
I WAS NOT SUGGESTING THAT FOX
NEWS BEING IN BUSINESS WITH
SAUDI ARABIA WAS ACTUALLY
SINISTER.
I WAS JUST USING THEIR SAME
REASONING TO ATTACK IMAM RAUF.
BUT THIS MORNING...
[LAUGHTER]
FOX NEWS GOT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT
THE REAL DANGER POSED BY THE
MOSQUE'S FUNDING.
>> THE KINGDOM FOUNDATION, WHICH
HAS BEEN A FUPSDER OF IMAM RAUF
IN THE PAST, THE KINGDOM
FOUNDATION, SO YOU KNOW, IS THIS
SAUDI ORGANIZATION HEADED UP BY
THE GUY WHO TRIED GIVE RUDY
GIULIANI $10 MILLION AFTER 9/11
THAT WAS SENT BACK.
>> RIGHT.
>> HE FUNDS RADICAL MADRASES ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
>> AND HE FUNDS THIS IMAM.
>> Jon: THE MONEY MIGHT BE
COMING FROM THIS EVIL KINGDOM
FOUNDATION, RUN BY A WHAT HAW
WORCESTER 9/11 SYMPATHIZING
AMERICAN-HATING... NO, NO, NO,
NO.
THAT'S RUPERT MURDOCH'S PARTNER.
SHOW ME THE DANGEROUS MONEY GUY.
THERE WE GO.
NO, NO!
THAT'S... YOU'RE NOT CHANGING
THE PICTURE.
YOU'RE...
[LAUGHTER]
NOOOOOOOOO!
WHY IS THE TERROR FUNDER SHAKING
HANDS?
WHY!
WHY IS THE TERROR FUNDER SHAKING
HANDS WITH A TWO-LEGGED BASSETT
HOUND?
[LAUGHTER]
WAIT, THAT'S RUPERT MURDOCH.
THE OWNER OF FOX NEWS.
THE TERROR FUNDER IS RUPERT
MURDOCH'S NEWS CORPS PARTNER.
NOOOOO!
NOOOOO!
NOOOO!
NOOOOOO!
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW ME
AROUND?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO...
[LAUGHTER]
NOOOOO!
I GUESS EVERYONE FAINTED IN THE
CONTROL ROOM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE GUY THEY'RE PAINTING AS A
SINISTER MONEY FORCE OWNS PART
OF FOX NEWS.
LET'S SEE WHAT FOX NEWS COMMANDS
AND FOLLOW THE MUST BE.
THIS IS THE PROPOSED TERROR
MOSQUE.
WE KNOW THAT IT'S A TERROR
MOSQUE BECAUSE THE MONEY MAY BE
COMING FROM A BAD GUY.
WHO DEFINITELY OWNS PART OF FOX
NEWS.
NOW WE KNOW HE'S A BAD GUY
BECAUSE WE JUST HEARD IT ON FOX
NEWS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND BY HEARING IT ON FOX NEWS,
WATCHING FOX NEWS, I'M
INCREASING THEIR VIEWERSHIP, AND
THEIR ADVERTISING RATES GO UP.
NOW, PART OF THAT MONEY GOES TO
THE BAD GUY WE LEARNED ABOUT ON
FOX BECAUSE HE'S THEIR PART
OWNER, THE SAUDI PRINCE,
ALLOWING HIM THEN TO MAKE IT
RAIN, SO TO SPEAK, ON THE TERROR
MOSQUE.
MY POINT IS THIS: IF WE WANT TO
CUT OFF FUNDING TO THE TERROR
MOSQUE, WE MUST, TOGETHER AS A
NATION, STOP WATCHING FOX.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
USING THEIR REASONING, IT'S THE
ONLY WAY TO CUT OFF THE REVENUE
STREAM TO THESE BAD DUDES.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW HERE'S THE MOST CURIOUS PART
ABOUT THIS ENTIRE REPORT.
>> THE KINGDOM FOUNDATION, SO
YOU KNOW, IS THIS SAUDI
ORGANIZATION HEADED UP BY THE
GUY WHO TRIED TO GIVE RUDY
GIULIANI $10 MILLION AFTER 9/11
THAT WAS SENT BACK.
>> RIGHT.
>> HE FUNDS RADICAL MADRASES ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
>> AND HE FUNDS THIS IMAM.
>> Jon: FOX TELLS US THE
TERRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS
KINGDOM FOUNDATION IS WHAT THEY
FUND, BUT THEY NEVER MENTIONED
THIS FELLA'S NAME AND THEY NEVER
SHOWED THIS FELLA'S PICTURE, AND
THEY CERTAINLY NEVER MENTIONED
THE FELLA THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
IS PARTED OWNER OF THEIR
COMPANY.
DID THE GANG AT FOX AND FRIENDS
GENUINELY NOT KNOW THE HEAD OF
THE KINGDOM FOUNDATION'S NAME
AND THE FACT HE'S ONE OF THEIR
PART OWNERS, OR WERE THEY
PURPOSELY COVERING IT UP BECAUSE
IT DIDN'T HELP THEIR FEAR-DRIVEN
NARRATIVE.
FOR MORE WE'RE DRIVEN BY JOHN
HOLL OLIPHANT.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
JOHN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M
GOING TO GO WITH THEY DIDN'T
KNOW.
REMEMBER, THINGS ARE HECTIC ON
THE MORNING SHOW, PLUS GRETCHEN
ISN'T THERE, AND SHE'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO KNOWS HOW THE USE
GOOGLE.
IT WAS PROBABLY A HOOTERS
MONDAY.
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE...
>> EXACTLY.
I'M WITH STUPID.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WYATT?
>> NOBODY IS THAT STUPID.
THEY'RE DELIBERATELY HIDING THE
TRUTH.
IF THE SAUDI PRINCE WASN'T PART
OWNER OF FOX NEWS, THEY WOULD
HAVE SAID HIS NAME OVER AND OVER
AGAIN, AND LOOK AT THESE
VILLAINOUS PICTURES.
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO DOCTOR
THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
HE ALREADY LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT
TO FEED TIMOTHY DALTON TO HIS
WHITE TIGER.
FOX WANTS TO ELUDE TO AL WHAT
LEAD BUT DOESN'T WANT VIEWERS
LOOKING THE GUY UP AND LEARNING
ABOUT THEIR OWN TIES TO HIM.
>> Jon: WYATT, WHY MENTION
THIS GUY AT ALL IN WHY GET INTO
THE MONEY TRAIL OF THE CULTURAL
CENTER IF IT LEADS RIGHT BACK TO
FOX?
>> I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
BECAUSE THEY'RE STUPID, JON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STAGGERINGLY, ACHINGLY, ALMOST
INSPIRINGLY STUPID.
LET'S LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE HERE.
>> CHINA IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY AND
IT'S A GREAT BIG COUNTRY THAT
NEEDS A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF.
>> WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS LOGO, I
WASN'T REALLY THINKING THIS, BUT
UPON FURTHER REVIEW, PERHAPS I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUCLEAR
SECURITY SUMMIT LOGO, WHAT DOES
THAT HAVE IN COMMON WITH ALL
THOSE OTHER FLAGS THERE?
>> I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH
OF AN INSULT IT WAS TO BE CALLED
AN IGNORE RAY MOUSE SINCE I
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT.
FOR ALL OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS LIKE ME.
>> IT CAN'T BE GOOD.
>> IT'S AN IGNORANT LAWYER.
>> LET'S RIGHT THAT DOWN.
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IGNORE IGNORAMUS
WAS, SO SHE LOOKED IT UP, AND
SHE STILL GOT IT WRONG.
[LAUGHTER]
EVEN IF THEY DID KNOW ABOUT THE
TIES TO NEWS CORPS, THE ODDS TO
GET THEM TO MENTION IT AT THE
PROGRAM WOULD BE RANDOM AT BEST.
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A
TELEPROMPTER AT FOX NEWS, IT'S
JUST A MAN JANGLING HIS KEYS
ABOVE THE CAMERA.
>> Jon: LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU
DOOCY, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO DAN
AND DANA USED TO WORK FOR?
GEORGEGEORGE W. BUSH.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHO GEORGE W.
BUSH USED TO HANG WITH?
PRINCE AL WALEEED.
BUM, BUM, BUM.
THAT'S SOME [BLEEPED].
IT'S A LEVEL OF KNOWING ON
FUSSZATION THAT CAN ONLY COME
FROM HAVING HEART OF PURE EVIL.
>> Jon: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A
POLARIZING DEBATE.
IS THERE CHANCE THERE IS A
THIRD, LESS EXPLOSIVE
EXPLANATION, SOMETHING ELSE.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT, JON.
THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS.
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT AS STUPID
AS I BELIEVE THEM TO BE, THEY
ARE REALLY [BLEEPED] EVIL.
>> AND IF THEY'RE NOT AS EVIL AS
I THINK THEY ARE, THEY ARE
STUPID.
WE'RE TALKING POTATOES WITH
MOUTHS.
>> NOT EVEN POTATOES, WYATT.
A POTATO CAN STILL POWER A
DIGITAL CLOCK.
>> GOOD POINT.
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT.
>> YOU'RE TALKING ROCKS WITH
MOUTHS.
