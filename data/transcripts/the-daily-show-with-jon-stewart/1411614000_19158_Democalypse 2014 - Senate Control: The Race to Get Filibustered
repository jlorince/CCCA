(LAUGHTER)WELL, I COULD SEE THAT,
YOU KNOW, McCONNELL'S WEAPONHOLDING FORM WOULD BE AN ISSUE
IF SENATORS WERE OUR FIRST LINEOF DEFENSE AGAINST ISIS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT LAST I CHECKED THEIR MAIN
JOB RESPONSIBILITIES WERERAISING MONEY FOR THEMSELVES
AND PREVENTING LAWS FROMBEING ENACTED.
(LAUGHTER)AND TO BE FAIR TO McCONNELL
WE DON'T KNOW IN THAT PICTUREIF HE WAS, IN FACT,
HANDING THE GUN TO A GIANT.
HE COULD HAVE BEEN.(LAUGHTER)
BUT CERTAINLY THATCOMMERCIAL CANNOT BE MORE
EMASCULATING UNLESSIT ALSO WENT AFTER
THE WAY McCONNELL URINATED.
HOW DO WE KNOW McCONNELLWILL STAND UP FOR KENTUCKY?
