GENTLEMAN'S F MINUS.
FOR CONGRESS TO GO BACK AND
KILL THE TRANSPARENCY
FEATURE OF THIS STOCK ACT
FOR STAFFERS, MUST NOT HAVE
BEEN AN EASY DECISION.
I WANT TO HEAR EVERY WORD OF
THE LOUD AND PASSIONATE
SENATE FLOOR DEBATE THAT
THEY HAD THERE.
PLAY THE ENTIRE THING.
AND WHILE YOU DO THAT I AM
GOING TO ENJOY THIS BIG BOY
PORTION OF MY FAVORITE
BENJAMIN AND JEROMES FROZEN
TREAT.
>> ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT
THAT THE BILL BE RED THREE
TIMES AND PASSED THE MOTION
TO RECONSIDER BE LAID ON THE
TABLE WITH NO INTERVENING
ACTION OR DEBATE.
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT DEBATE HAPPENED
SO QUICKLY I ACTUALLY HAVE
MORE ICE CREAM THAN WHEN I
STARTED.
(LAUGHTER)
HMMMM, GOOD THING I'M
LACTOSE INTOLERANT.
(LAUGHTER)
COMMERCIAL BREAK.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL LOOK, CONGRESS CAN DO
WHATEVER IT WANTS.
THAT REPEAL OF THAT
TRANSPARENCY PROVISION CAN'T
GO THROUGH UNLESS THE
PRESIDENT SIGNS IT.
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO SIGN
IT, IS HE?
CARNEY?
>> ON FRIDAY CONGRESS
QUIETLY PASSED CHANGES TO
THE STOCK ACT AND GOVERNMENT
TRANSPARENCY GROUPS SAY THE
CHANGES BASICALLY GUT THE
LAW, THEY'RE URGING THE
PRESIDENT TO VETO-- VETS OWE
IT, DOES HE PLAN TO SIGN IT
INTO LAW OR VETO IT AND WHY.
>> THE-- I THINK THE
PRESIDENT WAS SCHEDULED TO
SIGN THE LEGISLATION TODAY.
THE-- MYLAN GAUGE HERE.
>> Jon: LET ME HELP YOU OUT
THERE.
LET ME HELP YOU OUT THERE I
THINK THE LANGUAGE YOU MIGHT
BE LOOKING FOR IS THIS.
>> NBC NORTH DAKOTA NEWS,
YOUR NEWS LEADER IN HIGH
DEFINITION.

>> Jon: THAT JUST SAID, IS
THAT THE LANGUAGE YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR [BLEEP]

>> Jon: BY THE WAY THAT GUY
FORGOT TO ADD [BLEEP]

WITH THIS WORLD.
