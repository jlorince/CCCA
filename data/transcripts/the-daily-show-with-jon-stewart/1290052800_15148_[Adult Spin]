>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
THE NEW CONGRESS HAS ARRIVED IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. IN THE
REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC IS
ANYTHING TO GO BY IT'S GOING TO
BE A BUMPY RIDE.
>> WE'VE COME TO TAKE THE
GOVERNMENT BACK.
>> SOMEBODY HAS TO GO TO
WASHINGTON AND KNOCK THE HELL
OUT OF THE PLACE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE
I CAN GET MY I.D. BADGE?
THANKS A LOT.
NOW THAT THE VOTERS HAVE OPENED
APE REPUBLIC-CAN OF WHOP ASS IN
WASHINGTON ARE THESE LOAD
BEARING WALLS BECAUSE THEY ARE
COMING DOWN.
>> WE HAVE NEED TO HAVE AN ADULT
CONVERSATION ABOUT GETTING RID
OF DEBT.
>> I'M READY TO HAVE AN ADULT
CONVERSATION.
>> THIS IS GETTING US TOWARD THE
ADULT STAGE OF CONVERSATION.
THIS IS TIME FOR US AS AMERICANS
TO HAVE AN ADULT CONVERSATION
WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT THE
SERIOUS CHALLENGES OUR COUNTRY
FACES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE (bleep) GUY HAD
AN ACT.
[LAUGHTER]
I SEE IT'S ONLY NOVEMBER BUT THE
2011 TALKING POINTS ARE OUT WITH
ONE UTTERLY CONTRIVED PHRASE.
THE ANGRY PITCHFORK WIELDING
REPUBLICANS HAVE TRANSFORMED TO
DIPLOMATS.
SOME BACK AND FORTH CONVERSATION
NOT A BAD THING.
YOU BROUGHT IT UP REPUBLICANS
START.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
>> WE CAN'T RAISE TAXES IN THE
MIDDLE OF A RECESSION.
>> CAP AND TAX THAT'S A TAX ON
ENERGY.
THAT'S OFF THE TABLE.
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS
HEALTH CARE BILL NEVER EVER EVER
IS IMPLEMENTED.
I REFUSE TO COMPROMISE ON THE
RULE OF LAW.
I REFUSE TO GRANT AM NESTCY.
>> NO COMPROMISE ON ENDING THE
ERA OF RUNAWAY SPENDING.
>> Jon: BY ADULT CONVERSATION
YOU MEAN THE KIND OF
CONVERSATION WHERE THE ADULT
SAYS NO!
BECAUSE I SAID SO.
[LAUGHTER]
WAIT, IT'S LIKE THE ADULT
CONVERSATION WITH ADULTS TALKING
TO CHILDREN.
BUT IF THE REPUBLICANS REPUBLICANS ARE T
ADULTS, WHO ARE THE CHILDREN,
THE ONES NOT PARTICULARLY
INTERESTED IN HEARING THE
REASONS.
YES OR NO, CAN I BORROW THE CAR?
YES OR NO?
>> LIKE SO MANY COMING INTO
OFFICE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
CUTTING SPENDS.
I WANT TO TICK THROUGH ITEMS AND
GET A YES OR NO.
WOULD YOU MAKE CUTS IN SOCIAL
SECURITY?
I THINK WE HAVE A SOCIAL
SECURITY SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN
TO THE FUTURE AND WE NEED TO SIT
DOWN AT THE TABLE AND HAVE ADULT
CONVERSATIONS AND FIGURE OUT HOW
IT CAN BECOME VIABLE.
>> IS THAT A YES THAT COULD YOU
CONSIDER CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY
IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
>> IF IT WAS A SIMPLE ANSWER WE
WOULD HAVE SOLUTIONS BEFORE
THIS.
>> Jon: THAT CONGRESSWOMAN IS
SUCH A PATIENT MOM.
SORRY, HONEY YOU JUST (bleep)
CAN'T.
I JUST NEED A YES OR NO ANSWER.
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKED OVER AND
OVER WHERE YOU WANT THE CUT AND
WHAT YOU'VE SAID ACROSS THE
BOARD S. THAT CORRECT?
>> EVERYWHERE.
HERE IS WHAT MYSTIFIES ME.
YOU ARE A DUR AND 50% OF YOUR
PRACTICE CAME CAME FROM MEDICARE
AND MEDICAID, GOVERNMENT FEDERAL
REIMBURSEMENTS TO YOU FOR
PRACTICING MEDICINE, CORRECT?
>> RIGHT.
>> I HAVE TO READ THIS RIGHT
HERE, THE ONE PLACE YOU DON'T
WANT TO THE CUT IS DOCTOR
REIMBURSEMENT RATES?
>> Jon: THAT'S THE MEAT AND
POTATOES LITIGATING, CALLING THE
SENATOR'S PROFESSIONAL
EXPERIENCE TO DRAW HIM OUT ON A
SPECIFIC APPROACH.
>> WHEN I STARTED 93 FEES ARE 50
TP-BGT OF WHAT THEY WERE IN
1993.
SO THEY ALREADY HAVE BEEN CUT BY
50%.
WHAT YOU HAVE TO PICK SURE IS
YOU WANT TO CUT THEM BY 40%
MORE, FINE, GO AHEAD BUT THERE
MAY NOT BE ANY DOCTORS LEFT
SEEING MEDICARE PATIENTS.
>> Jon: STRONG DEFENSE WITH A
TOUCH OF SLIPPERY SLOPE.
A LITTLE HYPER BOLLIC BUT ON
POINT.
PERHAPS WE CAN GET IT DONE ON AN
ADULT LEVEL.
>> SENATOR, DOCTOR, WHAT WAS
YOUR PEAK INCOME OVER THE LAST
DECADE?
WHAT IS THE MOST YOU EARNED IN
ONE YEAR.
>> Jon: THIS IS WHERE THE
RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD?
WE'VE ARRIVED AT THE RUBICON.
EITHER WE'LL CONTINUE WITH AN
ADULT CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR
NATION'S BUDGET OR --
>> IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS
ABOUT ME PERSONALLY YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENT
DISCUSSION.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS
ABOUT -- DO I WANT TO GO INTO
YOUR PERSONAL PAST AND TALK
ABOUT YOUR PAST ON THIS PROGRAM?
I DON'T THINK SO.
>> SENATOR --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT
THIS IN AN ADULT WAY, THE WAY I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
MY GROUND RULES OR I CAN REMIND
EVERYONE YOU USED TO (bleep)
HOOKERS.
IT'S UP TO YOU.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: REPUBLICANS ARE THE
ADULTS.
>> WHAT IF WE MOVED IT UP TO $1
MILLION.
EVERYONE BELOW $1 MILLION WILL
GET A TAX CUT.
THE MILLIONAIRES AND
BILLIONAIRES WON'T.
>> I PROPOSE WE EXTEND THE TAX
CUTS FOR TWO YEARS.
>> I'M WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON
EXTENDING THE INCOME TAX CUTS
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
>> IT WOULD BE A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
TO REACH OUT TO THE BUSINESS
COMMUNITY AND SAY, WE DON'T HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.
LET'S WORK WITH YOU ON WHAT THE
TAX CUTS OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE.
>> Jon: THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE
STEP PARENTS, THE ONES WHO WILL
DO ANYTHING TO KEEP THE PEACE
AND ANYTHING TO GET YOU TO JUST
LOVE THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: DO YOU LIKE THE
COMPUTER THOUGH?
WHAT DO I HAVE T
