(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY!
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY
NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT
MORGAN FREEMAN IS GOING TO BE
JOINING US!
BUT FIRST --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT FIRST, NONFICTIONAL
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA GAVE A
MAJOR ADDRESS ON
COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY THIS
AFTERNOON AT WASHINGTON'S
NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY.
ACTUAL SAFETY SCHOOL.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
IN THE SPEECH PRESIDENT OBAMA
QUESTIONED HOW OUR OVERZEALOUS
PROSECUTION OF THE WAR ON TERROR
AND THE PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY
MAY BE AFFECTING OUR SOULS.
>> LOOK AT THE CURRENT SITUATION
WHERE WE ARE FORCE FEEDING
DETAINEES WHO ARE BEING HELD ON
A HUNGER STRIKE.
IS THIS WHO WE ARE?
IS THAT SOMETHING OUR FOUNDERS
FORESAW?
>> Jon: OH, I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
I ACTUALLY THINK ON A SCALE OF
"FOUNDERS FORESAW" PRISONER
MISTREATMENT WOULD TAKE A
BACKSEAT TO "BLACK PRESIDENT."
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK THE FIRST THING THEY
WOULD SAY IS "WHO'S THAT GUY?"
AND "WILL HE GET ME A SANDWICH?"
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IT IS A GOOD POINT, HOW A
NATION AND ITS LEADERS REACT TO
THREATS BOTH EXTERNAL AND
INTERNAL SAYS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT
THAT ADMINISTRATION'S VALUES AND
IDEALS.
AND WHILE IT'S HARD TO JUDGE AN
ADMINISTRATION BY THE ACTIONS IT
SAYS IT WANTS TO TAKE BUT CAN'T,
PERHAPS WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION FROM
THE ACTIONS IT SAYS IT WON'T
TAKE BUT DOES AS WE SEE IN OUR
NEW SEGMENT "PRIORITIES U.S.A."
(LAUGHTER)
IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S SEARCH
FOR LAW AND ORDER --
(LAUGHTER).
-- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
SHOW, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT --
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
VERY CLEAR ABOUT ITS VALUES.
>> A FREE PRESS IS ALSO
ESSENTIAL FOR OUR DEMOCRACY.
JOURNALISTS SHOULD NOT BE AT
LEGAL RISK FOR DOING THEIR JOBS.
>> THE WAY TO MAKE GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBLE IS TO HOLD IT
ACCOUNTABLE.
>> I WANT EVERYBODY TREATED
FAIRFULLY THIS COUNTRY.
TRANSPARENCY AND THE RULE OF LAW
WILL BE THE TOUCHSTONES OF THIS
PRESIDENCY.
>> Jon: WHAT THE -- HE DIDN'T
EVEN SAY IT!
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THOSE ARE
EXCELLENT VALUES.
LET'S SEE HOW THOSE VALUES HAVE
BEEN EXPRESSED.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS
PROSECUTED MORE GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS FOR ALLEGED LEAKS THAN
ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION BEFORE
IT.
>> Jon: HE DID BELIEVE IN
FREEDOM OF THE PERES.
JUST NOT FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT TALK TO THE
PRESS.
AND ABOUT THAT FREEDOM OF THE
PRESS --
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS
SNOOPING ON JOURNALISTS.
>> THE FEDS HAVE TRACKED MORE
THAN 20 PHONE LINES USED BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS.
>> FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON
CORRESPONDENT JAMES ROSEN, THE
F.B.I. NAMING HIM A CRIMINAL
COCONSPIRATOR IN THE LEAK.
>> AGENTS MONITORED ROSEN'S
MOVEMENT MOVEMENTS IN AND OUT OF
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THEY
SEARCHED HIS PERSONAL E-MAILS
AND COMBED THROUGH HIS CELL
PHONE RECORDS.
>> Jon: BUT THAT'S JUST THEM
EXHIBITING THE VALUE OF
FAIRNESS!
(LAUGHTER)
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AFTER
WHISTLE-BLOWERS, YOU ALSO GOT TO
GO AFTER THOSE WHO HAVE HAD
THEIR WHISTLES BLOWN!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS NOT HOW I WANTED TO SAY
THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY, NATIONAL SECURITY IS
IMPORTANT AND I'M SURE THE FULL
COURT PERES ON THIS ROSEN
CHARACTER, THIS ROSEN REPORTER
WAS IN THE SERVICE OF PROTECTING
SOME PRETTY PRETTY SENSITIVE
INFORMATION.
>> FOX NEWS REPORTERS JAMES
ROSEN VOWED WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO
PROTECT HIS SOURCE FOR A SCOOP
HE GOT BACK IN 2009 REPORTING
THEN NORTH KOREA WOULD RESPOND
TO SANCTIONS WITH MORE NUCLEAR
TESTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S IT?
THAT'S THE LEAK THEY NEEDED TO
QUASH?
NORTH KOREA TO ANSWER SANCTIONS
WITH MORE NUCLEAR TESTS?
NORTH KOREA ANSWERS EVERYTHING
WITH MORE NUCLEAR TESTS!
THAT'S -- THEY HAVE A NUCLEAR
TEST-BASED ECONOMY!
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT OTHER BIG JAMES ROSEN
SCOOPS ARE THREATENING NATIONAL
SECURITY?
TURKEY THE COUNTRY DIFFERENT
FROM TURKEY THE BIRD!
(LAUGHTER)
BABIES MAKE TERRIBLE SOUS CHEFS!
JON STEWART IS JEWISH!
