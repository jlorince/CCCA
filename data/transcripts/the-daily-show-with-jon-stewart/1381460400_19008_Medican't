>> HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOMETO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST, BRIAN JAY JONES.
>>HE'S THE AUTHOR OF ANEW BIOGRAPHY ON JIM HENSON.
VERY EXCITED TO TALK TO HIM.
EARLIER THIS WEEK WE TALKEDABOUT HOW THE OFFICIAL
LAUNCH OF OBAMACARE WASMARRED BY WEB GLITCHES
AND LONG DELAYS.
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER MAJOROBSTACLE TO OBAMACARE'S
IMPLEMENTATION.
TOTAL DICKISHNESS.
YOU SEE, OBAMACARE FOR ALLITS WELL-DOCUMENTED ISSUES
AND PROBLEMS IS STILL AWELL-INTENTIONED ATTEMPT TO
GET PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HADHEALTH INSURANCE IN THIS
COUNTRY HEALTH INSURANCE.
MEDICAID HAS TRADITIONALLYCOVERED PEOPLE UP TO THIS
INCOME LEVEL.
OBAMACARE WAS GOING TO COVERTHEM OSTENSIBLY DOWN TO THIS
INCOME LEVEL.
SO IT WAS GOING TO BE THEGAP THERE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF
AN iPAD EXCEPT INSTEAD OFAN iPAD IT IS ABOUT 8
MILLION PEOPLE LIVING JUSTABOVE THE POVERTY LINE SO TO
PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE FORTHIS NATION'S, YOU KNOW,
CREAMY CENTER, THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO GIVE
THE STATE GOVERNMENTS MONEYTO EXPAND THEIR MEDICAID
PROGRAM.
FOR THREE YEARS THE STATESWOULD PAY FOR THIS PROGRAM,
I THINK THE NUMBER WAS ABOUT0.
AND THEN AFTER THAT, THEYWOULD PAY UP TO 10%, I THINK,
BY THE TIME IT WAS 2020.
SO WHAT A GREAT DEAL.
BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT.
>> 26 STATES DECLINED TO GOTO THAT EXPENSE.
>> 26 STATES.
HOLY-- THAT'S LIKE A THIRDOF--
(LAUGHTER)A LITTLE MORE-- 26 STATES!
IT MUST BE A PRETTY ECLECTICGROUP WITH MANY DIFFERENT
REASONS TO EXPLAIN WHY THEYWOULD TURN DOWN FEDERAL
MONEY TO BRING HEALTH CARETO THEIR WORKING POOR OR MAY
BE IT WAS JUST ONE REASON.
>> ALL OF THOSE STATES HAVEREPUBLICAN GOVERNORS OR
LEGISLATURES THAT ARECONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS.
>> OH.
WHICH MAKES IT REALLY HARDNOT TO SEE THIS IS JUST THE
LATEST EXAMPLE OF THAT HITGAME SHOW SWEEPING PART OF
THE NATION, WHAT DO YOU HATEMORE, POVERTY OR OBAMA? BROUGHT
TO YOU BY SPITE.
SPITE, THEEMOTION THAT MAKES YOU TURN
DOWN MILLIONS OF DOLLARSTHAT WOULD GO TOWARDS HEALTH
CARE FOR THE WORKING POORBECAUSE YOU HATE THE
PRESIDENT.
AND ARBY'S.
ARBY'S.
(LAUGHTER)TECHNICALLY IT'S FOOD.
NOW OF COURSE-- OF COURSE IIMAGINE THAT THE STATES WHEN
ASKED WHY THEY DIDN'T ACCEPTTHE MEDICAID EXPANSION DON'T
PROBABLY LIST SPITE AS THEANSWER.
SO LET'S SEE WHAT THEIRREASON IS.
YOU THERE, GOVERNOR OF THESTATE IN THIS NATION THAT
HAS THE MOST UNINSUREDCHILDREN OUT OF ANY OTHER
STATE.
>> MEDICAID EXPANSION ISSIMPLY PUT A MISGUIDED AND
ULTIMATELY DOOMED ATTEMPT TOMASK THE SHORTCOMINGS OF
OBAMACARE.
>> TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM ISNOT UNLIKE ADDING A THOUSAND
PEOPLE TO THE TITANIC.
>> Jon: TRUE, THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S REALLY TRUE.
IF THE TITANIC HAD CRASHEDINTO A HOSPITAL.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVERYTHING'S BIGGER IN TEXAS,ESPECIALLY TUMORS.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MISSISSIPPI.
YOU, MISSISSIPPI, OR AS YOUARE ALSO KNOWN, THE 49th
HEALTHIEST STATE IN THEUNION-ISSIPPI.
>> OF ALL THE STATES IN THECOUNTRY THAT SHOULD BE
EMBRACING SOME OF THECHANGES COMING FROM
OBAMACARE, YOUR CRITICSWOULD SAY MISSISSIPPI
SHOULD BE AT THE FRONT OFTHE LIST.
>> PETER, THE PROBLEM IS, ITIS THE WORST SYSTEM OF
DELIVERING HEALTH CARE KNOWNTO MAN.
>> Jon: NO, IT'S NOT.
LISTEN, IT'S NOT PERFECT.
A LOT OF THINGS WE'D LIKE TOCHANGE BUT IT IS NOT THE
WORST SYSTEM OF DELIVERINGHEALTH CARE KNOWN TO MAN.
AS ANYBODY KNOWS WHO HASBEEN A PATIENT AT ENEMA HUT.
(LAUGHTER)ENEMA HUT, BECAUSE THERE
AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUTHAT CAN'T BE CURED BY SOME
RECTAL IRRIGATION.
