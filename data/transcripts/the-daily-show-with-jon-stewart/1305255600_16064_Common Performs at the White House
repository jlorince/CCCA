>> Jon: GOOD EVENING!
WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW" MY
NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A TERRIFIC PROGRAM FOR
YOU.
THE LOVELY KRISTEN WIIG WILL BE
JOINING US FROM "S.N.L.," AND
ALSO-- YOU KNOW, SHE ACTUALLY IS
IN A MOVIE THAT'S COMING OUT
THIS WEEKEND.
IN FACT, IT SEEMS ALMOST EVERY
TIME THESE INCREDIBLY TALENTED
PEOPLE STOP BY TO SAY HELLO TO
ME FOR FIVE MINUTES, THEY
COINCIDENTALLY HAVE A MOVIE
COMING OUT THAT SAME-- I DON'T
KNOW HOW IT WORKS OUT THAT WAY,
BUT IT... IT...
( LAUGHTER )
REAL QUICK.
AS YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT, THERE
WAS A POETRY READING AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE FIRST
POETRY READING AT THE WHITE

INFAMOUS 1996 CELEBRATION "A
NIGHT WITH THE MAN FROM
NANTUCKET.

IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES
TO MEMORIES OF A FAVORITE
TEACHER TO HOW HARD IT IS TO
FIND A NICE BLAZER ON SHORT

DOES THAT'S WALLPAPER COME OFF?

PROGRESSIVE RAPPER COMMON, WHO
WAS THE SUBJECT OF FOX NEWS
CHANNEL'S LATEST EXERCISE IN
FITS OF HISSY, HE PERFORMED TO
THEIR CHAGRIN, SPOKE OUT ABOUT
COMMUNITIES TRYING TO OVERCOME A
CULTURE OF VIOLENCE TO OBTAIN A
MORE POSITIVE FUTURE.
OF COURSE, THAT'S HOW PEOPLE
WOULD INTERPRET HIS PERFORMANCE.
FOR THOSE WHO HUFF ONLY THE
HEADY MIX OF PARTISAN HACKRY,
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, AND
MANUFACTURED OUTRAGE, KNOWN AS
"FOXYGEN"--
( LAUGHTER )
IT LOOKED A LITTLE--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE HIGH-FIVED WHEN WE CAME UP
WITH THAT ONE.
( LAUGHTER )
COMMON'S PERFORMANCE LOOKED A
LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS
♪ AND NOW BLACK, Y'ALL, AND NOW,
BLACK Y'ALL, AND NOW ♪ ♪
>> Jon: WHY WOULD THEY INVITE
SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BLOW UP
THE ENTIRE BUILDING?
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW, YOU GET THE SENSE WHEN
WH FOX NEWS HOSTS AND PUNDITS
ARE DONE WITH THEIR PROGRAMS
THEY LOOK BOTH WA
