ELECTION NIGHT EDITION OF THEDAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
TONIGHT, THE 2014 MIDTERMRESULTS
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVEBEEN WAITING FOR.
AND BY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE, IMEAN THE SENATE.
CHANCES ARE -- WELL LET'S FACEFACTS,
DEMOCRATS ARE ABOUT TO LOSE THEGOOD SENATE RESTROOMS.
(LAUGHTER)LATER ON, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
REINCE PRIEBUS ON THE SHOW,HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
HE WILL BE GIDDY.
I PREDICT THIS INTERVIEW WILL BETHE WORST PART OF THE GREATEST
NIGHT OF HIS LIFE. BUT MAN, LETME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH
GAME OF THRONES, BUT IT IS A REDWEDDING OUT THERE.
IT IS A BLOOD BATH BEYONDANYTHING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE.
BUT I WANTED TO ADDRESSSOMETHING FIRST.
SOMETHING HAPPENED, I WAS OVERAT CNN TODAY.
I SAID SOMETHING ON THE AIR ANDIT CREATED A BIT OF A STIR.
I WANTED TO GET TO IT. I WASON CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR'S
SHOW ON CNN AND I SAID THIS --
>> DID YOU VOTE? >> Jon: NO.
NO.
I JUST MOVED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE MY THINGIS NOW.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING...
FIRST OF ALL.
I'VE KNOWN WHERE MY THING ISSINCE I WAS 13.
(LAUGHTER)BUT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
I DID VOTE TODAY. I DID KNOWWHERE MY BOOTH WAS.
I WAS BEING FLIP AND IT KINDOF
TOOK OFF AND, YOU KNOW WHAT?I WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FLIP ABOUTTHAT BECAUSE I THINK I WASN'T
CLEAR ENOUGH I WAS KIDDINGAND IT SENT A MESSAGE THAT
I DIDN'T THINK VOTING WASIMPORTANT OR THAT I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS A BIG ISSUE, AND IDO, AND I DID VOTE AND I WAS
BEING FLIP AND I SHOULDN'T HAVEDONE THAT.
THAT WAS STUPID.
SO I APOLOGIZE. AND YEAH, THAT'SIT.
(APPLAUSE)ANYWAY.
NOW, I WANT TO GET TO SOMERESULTS. FIRST OF ALL,
I'M GOING TO START A LITTLE BITLOCAL HERE. AS YOU KNOW,
IN NEW YORK, GOVERNOR CUOMO WASRUNNING FOR REELECTION AND HE
WON EIGHT WEEKS AGO,BUT I THOUGHT WE WOULD
ANNOUNCE IT TONIGHT. IT'SACTUALLY A LITTLE CLOSER THAN
WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TOBE, 59% TO 39%.
ALSO IN JERSEY, SOMETHING THATWAS SORT OF A FAIT ACCOMPLI
CENTER, CORY BOOKER DEFEATEDJEFF BELL. AND HERE'S THE THING,
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERYEXCITED.
BOOKER WASN'T AROUND TO MAKE AVICTORY SPEECH.
HE WAS APPARENTLY BURNINGSOMEBODY FROM A BURNING CAR
WHILE TWEETING.
(LAUGHTER)HE'S A VERY SPECIAL MAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING ASA SENATOR.
BUT AS A SUPERHERO, HE'S REALLYQUITE GOOD.
THIS IS WHERE IT GETSINTERESTING.
IN KENTUCKY, ALISON LUNDERGANGRIMES WAS GOING UP AGAINST A
SMALL, SMALL-MOVING REPTILIANFIGURE.
(LAUGHTER)HE'D BEEN IN THE SENATE.
HE'S 220 YEARS OLD AS MANYTORTOISES ARE.
AND HE WAS UP AGAINST HER.
EVERYONE WAS SAYING IT'S NECKAND NECK.
HERE ARE THE REAL RESULTS,GRIMES VS. MCCONNELL.
HE ABSOLUTELY, HE ABSOLUTELYCRUSHED HER.
AND IF I MAY QUOTE MITCHMcCONNELL TONIGHT -- SLOW AND
STEADY... AAAA-YUP!
(LAUGHTER)SO HE WILL BE THE NEW SENATE
MAJORITY LEADER AND I PERSONALLYASKED SOMEONE WHO TRULY ENJOYS
DOING THE VOICE, I COULDN'T BEMORE EXCITED. AND ON THAT SAME
NOTE, IN SOUTH CAROLINA,WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS THE
CAROLINA EVEN NORTH CAROLINADOESN'T LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH,
BRAD HUTTO WAS RUNNING AGAINSTSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.
GRAHAM ABSOLUTELY FLATTENED THISCAT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
OH, MY GOSH!
HE WON BY SO MUCH HE FAINTED!
LINDSEY GRAHAM GIVING HIMSELFTHE VAPORS TONIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)LOOK, I'M TRYING TO FIND ANY WAY
TO ENTERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ARETRULY ON A LEDGE TONIGHT.
THESE PEOPLE, EVERYQUESTION IN WARM UP,
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TOHAPPEN NOW?
AS THOUGH THE SENATE WAS AFUNCTIONING BODY BEFORE TONIGHT.
BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU WEREWONDERING HOW WILL I KNOW IF THE
SENATE CHANGES CONTROL, YOUKNOW, I REALIZE THE NEWS
NETWORKS WILL PROBABLY SAY THATVERBATIM, BUT YOU MAY BE
WONDERING, WELL, HOW WILL WEKNOW IF THE SENATE CHANGES
CONTROL AND WE DON'T HAVE ATELEVISION AND WE LIVE OUTSIDE
WITHIN A COUPLE OF BLOCKS OF THEEMPIRE STATE BUILDING?
>> YOU CAN KEEP TABS ON THECONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE IN A
VERY, VERY COOL WAY AND ONLYHERE ON CNN, THE EMPIRE STATE
BUILDING. CHECK THISOUT. IF THE DEMOCRATS MAINTAIN
THEIR MAJORITY IN THEUNITED STATES SENATE, THE
BUILDING WILL FLASH IN BLUE.
IF THE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL,IT WILL FLASH BRIGHT RED.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT IS AMAZING.
THAT IS SO COOL!
THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF THEBRITISH WERE COMING AND PAUL
REVERE HAD (BLEEP) OF MONEY TOWASTE.
(LAUGHTER)WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU DON'T OWN HALLOWED LANDMARKSIN NEW YORK, CNN.
TONIGHT, IF REPUBLICANS TAKEBACK THE
SENATE, WE WILL REPLACE THESTATUE OF LIBERTY'S TORCH AND
TABLET  WITH AN AK 47 AND ABIBLE.
BOOM! BEAT THAT. AND IFDEMOCRATS BY SOME STRANGE
STROKE OF LUCK KEEP THE SENATE,WHICH IS NOT HAPPENING,
THE WORLD WILL FIND OUT THAT THEDEMOCRATS HAVE KEPT IT
BECAUSE THE DAILY SHOW WILL BLOWUP THE MOON. THE MOON!
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOUNEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THE MOON
BLOWING UP
