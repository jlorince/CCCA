COMEDY CENTRAL
>> WELL COME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
WELCOME.
MI JOHN OLVER, I'M STILL
SITTING IN FOR JON STEWART
WHO IS CURRENTLY ON AN
UNINHABITED ISLAND IN THE
PAS CIVIC LEARNING ABOUT THE
HUMAN CONDITION AND
BEFRIENDING A VOLLEYBALL.
OUR GUESTS TONIGHT HERE TO
DISCUSS HIS ONE MAN SHOW
UNCONSTITUTIONAL COLIN QUINN
IS GOING TO BE HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
VERY FUNNY MAN.
BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH
OUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH FAST
FOOD.
WELL, NOT SOME OF A LOVE
AFFAIR AS AN UNHEALTHY ONE
WAY RELATIONSHIP WITH
SOMETHING THAT IS TRYING TO
KILL US.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT LATELY THAT RELATIONSHIP
HAS BECOME A BIT MORE
STRAINED.
>> A NATIONWIDE PUSH WORKERS
CALLING FOR A MUCH HIGHER
MINIMUM WAGE.
>> WORKERS AT McDONALD'S,
WENDIESING DOMINO PIZZA AND
MORE WILL WALK OFF THE JOB
TODAY.
HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING
FOR.
THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE AND AN
INCREASE IN WAGES FROM $7.50
AN HOUR TO $15 AN HOUR.
>> MAKE OUR WAGES SUPERSIZED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> YES, YES.
CORPORATIONS BE LESS GREEDY,
GIVE OUR WALLETS DIABETES!
YEAH, YEAH.
IF YOU WANT MY-- [BLEEP]

LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHETHER
IT'S WITH WAGES, TAX CUTS OR

>> McDONALD'S MADE 5.5
BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFITS
ALONE LAST YEAR.
>> YEAH.
>> OKAY THEN.
TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T
REALIZE THE GOLDEN ARCHES
WERE LITERALLY 24 KARAT
GOLD.
ALSO, ALSO, JUST TO BE
HONEST, THAT 5.5 BILLION
ISN'T ALL FROM FOOD SALES.
TWO-THIRDS OF THAT, THE
HAMBURGLER MADE BY
SPECULATING ON FUTURES.
TOTALLY LEGAL, THAT'S THE
INCREDIBLE THING.
HE DIDN'T COMMIT A CRIME.
LOOK, DEEP DOWN MOST
BUSINESSES WOULD LOVE TO
HELP THE MOST VUL
NEVER-- VULNERABLE MEMBERS
OF SOCIETY.
THEIR QUESTION IS JUST
WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM.
>> YOU PUT MONEY IN THE
POCKETS OF WORKERS, THEY'RE
GOING TO SPEND T OFTEN AT
THE VERY ESTABLISHMENTS
THEY'RE WORKING AT IT WILL
FUEL A POSITIVE CYCLE.
>> IF WE WERE TO RAISE THE
FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO
10.10 AN HOUR THAT WOULD
GENERATE ABOUT $32 BILLION
IN INCREASED CONSUMER

>> WELL, THAT WOULD BE GOOD
