>> Jon: COME ON.
THE REAL PROBLEM ISN'T HOWPOSSIBLE FUTURE PRESIDENTS MIGHTHANDLE UKRAINE
IT'S HOW COULD OUR CURRENTPRESIDENT HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN.
>> UKRAINE AND OTHER COUNTRIESTRYING TO GET SOME FREEDOM BUT
THE PRESIDENT HAS LOST MORALAUTHORITY.
>> THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO UP HISGAME AND SEND A CLEAR PUBLIC
MESSAGE TO PUTIN.
>> WE CONTINUE TO LET VLADMIRPUTIN PUSH US AROUND.
>> WHEN YOU PROJECT WEAKNESS,PEOPLE DON'T FEAR YOU AND THEY
DO WHAT THEY WANT.
>> Jon: SO WEAK.
SO MAD AT OUR WEAKNESS.
THANKS TO OBAMA'S LILY LIVEREDCHAMBERLAINESQUE APPEASEMENT OF
THE BETEATED RULER OF THECAUCASUS [LAUGHTER]
OLD IVAN NIPOLOVICH.
HE GETS TO PULL THE STRINGS ANDONCE AGAIN CLAIM UKRAINE FOR
THE -- WHAT ARE THEY CALLING ITNOW PUTINISTAN, WHATEVER THEYARE
CALLING IT.
THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THATINTERPRETATION IS THAT ITAPPEARS THE PUTIN FORCES ARE
LOSING A HANDLE ON THE UKRAINEBUT REALLY NEVER MIND I'M SURE A
POPULOUS UPRISING AGAINSTPUTIN'S PUPPET IS PART OF HISPLAN AND WE KNOW
WHICH PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE THEMEDICINE FOR THIS UKRAINE MESS.
>> WHAT WOULD RONALD REAGAN HAVEDONE.
>> RONALD REAGAN WOULD LEAD THEFREE WORLD.
>> HE BROKE DOWN THE WALL.
ENDED THE COLD WAR.
>> NO RED LINES, HE SIMPLYACTED.
>> Jon: YES, I SHOULD KNOWBECAUSE MY NAME IS OLIVER NORTH
AND WHEN I WORKED FOR RONALDREAGAN I ILLEGALLY SOLD WEAPONSTO
IRAN AND ILLEGALLY TOOK THATMONEY AND ILLEGALLY GAVE IT TO
NICARAGUAN DEATH SQUADS OR ASWE CALLED IT BACK THEN SIMPLY
ACTING.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT POINT TAKEN.
REAGAN WOULD NOT LET THESEFREEDOM-HATING RUSSIAN
UKRAINIANS PUSH US AROUND.
THE SOVIET UNION INVADEDAFGHANISTAN, REAGAN SIMPLY
ACTED.
>> WHEN THE SOVIET UNION INVADEDIN 1979 [EXPLOSION] A GROUP OF
AFGHAN MUSLIMS DECLARED A HOLYWAR.
THEY WERE KNOWN AS THEMUJAHIDIN.
BOTH THE CARTER AND REAGANADMINISTRATIONS GAVE THEM $3
BILLION IN MILITARY AID TO FIGHTTHE SOVIETS.
>> Jon: PROBLEM SOLVED REAGANSTYLE.
>> THE MOST MILITANT EXTREMISTFACTION OF THE MUJAHIDIN TURNED
INTO THE TALIBAN.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT
THOSE GUYS FOR AT LEAST 12 MOREYEARS AND REAGAN WAS SIMPLY GONE
BY THEN.
AND WHEN THE FREEDOM-LOVINGIRAQIS GOT INTO A WAR WITH IRAN,
REAGAN SIMPLY ACTED.
ALLOWING SAUDI ARABIA TO SELLSADDAM HUSSEIN AMERICAN-MADE
WEAPONS.
[LAUGHTER]BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT THAT
GUY FOR LIKE TWO MORE YEARS.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND THEN AGAIN
12 YEARS AFTER THAT.
THE POINT IS THIS:  REAGAN ACTEDNO MATTER WHAT THE (bleep) WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]NOT LIKE OLD PRESIDENT SITS ON
HIS HANDS CONTENT TO DO NOTHINGBUT FIRE HELL FIRE MISSILES INTO
FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ARM SYRIANREBELS AND BOMB LIBYA, YOU KNOW
PASSIVE STUFF.
[ LAUGHTER ]THE POINT IS, WHILE WE WERE
DILLY DALLYING, PUTIN GOT THEADVANTAGE.
I'M SURE HIS MAN YANUKOVYCH WASSTRENGTHENING THE GRIP ON
AUTHORITY WHILE LOOSENING THEGRIP ON HIS SHIRT AND THE TWO OFTHEM
WERE GOING TO DO SOME SLAVIC MANBOOB POWER TRANSFER.
>> PRESIDENT VIKTOR YANUKOVYCHFLEEING THE CAPITAL OF KIEV.
>> AN INTERIM PRESIDENT HAS BEENAPPOINTED AND THE COUNTRY IS SETTO VOTE IN MAY.
>> Jon: WAIT THE PUTIN GUYFLED?
FORCES OF FREEDOM PREVAILED?  ITHINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.
THE GHOST OF REAGAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]HAUNTED YANUKOVYCH, TOLD HIM TO
LEAVE BOO CRANE.
THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.
>> TWO DAYS BEFORE HE FLED ANOBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
SAYS HE WAS ON THE PHONE FORMORE THAN TWO HOURS WITH VICE
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
BIDEN TOLD HIM THE WINDOW FOR ARESOLUTION TO THE CRISIS WAS
QUICKLY CLOSING.
>> Jon: NO WONDER HE GOT THE(bleep) OUT THERE.
TWO HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH JOEBIDEN?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
