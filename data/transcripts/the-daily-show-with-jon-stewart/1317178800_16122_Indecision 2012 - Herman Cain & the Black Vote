ARE FOR $2,000 HOLDING HIS FAKE
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
MEANWHILE, ON THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE THERE'S BEEN A SHAKEUP IN
THE G.O.P. FIELD AS PRESUMED
FRONT-RUNNERS RICK PERRY AND
MITT ROMNEY LOST THE FLORIDA
STRAW POLL BY DOUBLE DIGIT
MARGINS TO FORMER GODFATHER'S
PIZZA C.E.O. HERMAN CAIN.
THE VICTORY SPEECH, CAIN
DECLARED "AS A BLACK REPUBLICAN,
HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT
OBAMA."
>> I BELIEVE, QUITE FRANKLY,
THAT MY CAMPAIGN, I WILL GARNER
A MINIMUM OF A THIRD OF A BLACK
VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY AND
POSSIBLY MORE.
I THINK THEY'RE OVER THIS FIRST
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT
THING.
I THINK THAT IS BEHIND THEM.
>> Jon: I'M SURE THAT YOU DO.
(LAUGHTER)
JOINING US IS OUR SENIOR BLACK
CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MARY, TELL ME.
IS HERMAN CAIN RIGHT?
ARE BLACK VOTERS OVER OBAMA?
>> WELL, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY,
JON, IT WAS SWEET TO ELECT THE
FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT BUT IT
WILL BE EVEN SWEETER TO SEE THE
FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT KICKED OUT
OF OFFICE BY THE SECOND BLACK
PRESIDENT!
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF IT HAPPENED HE'D JUST
KICK RICK PERRY'S AWECATION ASS
UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF FLORIDA
PROVING SOMETIMES POLITICS IS
LIKE A PORN MOVIE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HOW'S THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, PIZZA GUY SHOWS UP
OUT OF NOWHERE AND (BLEEP)S YOU.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT, JON.
WITH CAIN IN THERE BLACK PEOPLE
CAN'T LOSE!
>> Jon: HERMAN CAIN WAS A GREAT
WIN IN A FLORIDA STRAW POLL BUT
HE'S A LONG SHOT FOR THE
NOMINATION.
>> THEN HE GOES BACK TO MAKING
PIZZA.
LIKE I SAID, WE CAN'T LOSE!
>> Jon: I DO NOT SEE HOW YOU CAN
BE EXCITED BY HERMAN CAIN!
YOU WERE A HUGE OBAMA SUPPORTER.
>> I DON'T RECALL IT THAT WAY.
I VOTED FOR OBAMA BECAUSE HE WAS
BLACK, NOT BECAUSE I AGREED WITH
HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
I BARELY AGREED WITH HIM THAT HE
WAS BLACK.
(LAUGHTER)
AND WE'RE NOT GIVING OUT FREE
PASS THIS IS TIME AROUND.
BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS TWICE THE
LEVEL OF WHITE UNEMPLOYMENT.
AND WHAT DOES OBAMA TELL A BLACK
AUDIENCE?
>> SHAKE IT UP!
STOP COMPLAINING!
SOME GRUMBLING!
STOP CRYING!
(LAUGHTER)
STOP COMPLAINING, SOME GRUMBLING
STOP CRYING?
WHY IS HE ALWAYS PICKING ON US,
JON?
(MUMBLING)
(CRYING)
WHY DO OUR PROBLEMS ALWAYS HAVE
TO COME LAST, JON?
>> Jon: YOU WERE JUST
COMPLAINING AND THEN YOU
GRUMBLED AND THEN YOU WERE
CRYING.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO!
>> LOOK, MY POINT IS WHEN JEWISH
VOTERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
OBAMA'S ISRAEL POLICY HE
ADDRESSES THEM.
HE DOESN'T TELL YOU TO STOP
COMPLAINING, GRUMBLING AND
CRYING SHCHLT.
>> Jon: WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU, JEWS ARE NOT A PARTICULAR
COMPLAINY PEOPLE SO I DON'T SEE
WHY HE WOULD TELL US THAT
BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY... HERE'S
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DO YOU THINK HERMAN CAIN
WOULD BE BETTER TO AFRICAN
AMERICANS THAN OBAMA?
HE HASN'T PROPOSED ANYTHING THAT
WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO BLACK
VOTERS.
>> YES, HE HAS.
JUST LISTEN TO WITH THE RIGHT
EARS.
>> I'M GOING TO PASS MY 9-9-9
PLAN.
A 9% PERSONAL TAX, A 9% NATIONAL
SALES TAX.
>> Jon: 999.
IT'S A TAX PLAN AND A SET OF
LOTTO NUMBERS!
(LAUGHTER)
9... WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE?
>> Jon: 9.
>> I'M BOXING THESE NUMBERS,
JON.
OH, WAIT, I'M GOING TO PLAY IT
STRAIGHT, NO, I THINK I'LL BOX
THEM.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU BOX... FORGET
ABOUT IT.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BLACK
VOTE HERE.
WHAT ABOUT WHITE VOTERS?
ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE A SECOND
BLACK PRESIDENT IN A ROW JUST
BECAUSE HE'S...
>> JON, THEY'LL VOTE FOR A
SECOND AND A THIRD.
LINE THEM UP, JON.
I THINK WHITE VOTERS HAVE
FINALLY LEARNED WHAT WHITE WOMEN
HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHICH IS...
>> ONCE YOU GO....
>> Jon: BLACK.
>> HEY, HEY, NO, JON, LET ME
FINISH, GOD.
ONCE YOU GO DOWN THE ROAD TO
DIVERSITY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
CHANGE COURSE AND RETURN TO
ONE'S PREVIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO SAY... HOW IS THAT A THING
WHITE WOMEN KNOW?
>> JON, I THINK BECAUSE WOMEN
STRUGGLED FOR THEIR OWN RIGHTS.
THEY KNOW HOW SATISFYING IT
FEELS TO TAKE A MASSIVE....
>> Jon: BLACK?
>> NO, JON, STOP!
STEP FORWARD, JON!
>> Jon: SORRY ABOUT THAT.
