YOU'RE GREAT IN THIS MOVIE,IT'S ALL GREAT.
IT'S ALL [BLEEP]BUT THIS IS TOTAL [BLEEP]
>> Jon:  NO.
>> BUT IT'S A TOUGH PLACE AS ANACTOR.
THERE MUST BE SOME RESIDUAL OFTHIS THAT STAYS WITH YOU, NO,
WHEN YOU DO A ROLE LIKE THIS, AFILM LIKE THIS.
>> THERE IS BUT I THINK THERE'SA PERVERSITY TO
BEING AN ACTORTHAT PARTICULARLY IN MY CASE,
DOESN'T ENJOY IT, I WOULDN'T SAYENJOYS IT BUT IS DEFINITELY
FASCINATED WITH THESE WORLDS.
IN A WORLD LIKE THIS EVEN THOUGHIT IS FILLED WITH A LOT OF
DARKNESS.
>> Jon:  DARK STORY, KIDNAP,TORTURE.
>> I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN ANIDEA OF SOMEONE THAT WAS A HERO
THAT WASN'T IN THE LIKELYPLACE YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE.
THERE'S A LOT SAID ABOUT THEKIDNAPPING AND THE STORY BUT
WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT IS WHATDOES IT TAKE TO BE A FATHER,
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A MAN,WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO DO YOUR JOB
THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.
>> Jon:  TRAVEL IN THAT WORLDAND TRY AND CLEAN IT UP TO SOME
EXTENT, TRY TO BE THE PERSONTHAT YOU KNOW, HELPS ESTABLISH
THAT.
>> YES.
>> Jon:  IT WAS ROUGH.
THE MUSICAL NUMBER HELPS.
[LAUGHTER]>> THE THING ABOUT WORKING WITH
HUGH JACKMAN -->> Jon:  HA HA HA HA.
HE JUST BREAKS INTO SONG.
>> I HAD A BEARD.
>> HERE WE GO.
>> BUT THERE'S JUST A SPOT.
UNDER THE CHIN JUST LITTLE BIT.
A LITTLE BIT OF GRAY.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TOHAPPEN TO THAT.
[LAUGHTER]LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT --
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ATHING.
YOU'RE SAYING IT ON THE TOP OFYOUR HEAD.
[LAUGHTER]>> THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, THAT WAS
BEAUTIFUL.
[APPLAUSE]>> I AM DORIAN GREY.
I AM THE EMBODIMENT.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN YOURATTIC JUST LIKE ME RIGHT NOW.
COME ON GYLLENHAAL.
>> OH IT'S COMING, MY FRIEND.
IT'S ON ITS WAY.
WHEN YOU GET OLDER IT'S LIKE IHAVE DESSICANTS IN MY PANTS, I
SUCKING ALL THE MOISTURE.
>> WE GOT FROM THE TOP TO THEBOTTOM.
>> TO THE BOTTOM, MY FRIEND.
>> BUT THINGS ARE GOODOTHERWISE.
>> EVERYTHING IS GREAT, YES.
>> SOMEONE WAS ASKING ME EARLIERIN THE AUDIENCE ABOUT BATMAN.
WOULD YOU DO, BECAUSE THEY'RELIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BEN
AFFLECK.
I THINK HE WILL DO GREAT ASBATMAN.
I'M NOT BOTHERED BY CASTINGCHOICES.
>> THAT'S GOOD.
>> YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUCH A
HULLABALOO. BECAUSEIT'S A MYTHIC CHARACTER. DO YOU
REALLY WANT ME TO GO INTO THIS?
>> BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS THEIRIDEAS AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IT
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODYTO EXPRESS IT AND WE LIVE IN
AMERICA WHERE THAT SHOULD BEAMERIDONE AND IT'S A GREATBE
OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ACTORAND WHEN YOU GET TO
PLAY THAT ROLE IT'SSUPER BAD [BLEEP] AND ITHINK HE'S GOING TO BE
SUPER BAD [BLEEP] IN IT.
>> Jon:  AS LONG AS BATMANSTILL EXISTS IN THE COMIC BOOKS.
>> YES.
>> AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT LIKEOH AND NOW BEN AFFLECK IS BATMAN
IN ALL OF YOUR COMIC BOOKS.
[LAUGHTER]WHY DOES ANYONE GIVE A [BLEEP]
IT'S A MOVIE.
IT BOGGLES MY MIND.
HOW CAN DANNY DEVITO BE THEPENGUIN.
WHO [BLEEP] KNOWS.
THE PENGUIN'S NOT A PERSON.
>> I'M SPEECHLESS.
I MEAN CASTING IS FOREVER A PARTOF MY LIFE, FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING OF MY CAREER.
WHEN I'M CAST IN A ROLE I'M JUSTPLAIN EXCITED.
MOST OF THE TIME IT REALLYDOESN'T MATTER WHAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GET YOUR JOB AND YOU TRY ANDYGET ANOTHER ONE AND I THINK ASD
ANACTOR REGARDLESS HOW MUCH
SUCCESS SOMEBODY'S HAD EVENSOMEBODY LIKE MR. AFFLECK.
CAN'T YOU CALL HIM BEN?
THERE'S A HOLLYWOOD HIERARCHY.
>> Jon:  OH REALLY.
>>LORD AFFLECK, I SALUTE YOU,SIR.
IS IT WEIRD FOR AN ACTOR, I WASWONDERING ABOUT
THIS WITH THE PEOPLE THATWERE KIND ENOUGH TO BE
IN THE FILM THAT I WASDOING SO THEY JUSTLEAVE AND THEY HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW INTHAT LITTLE DARK ROOM WHERE I
COULD BE JUST RUININGEVERYTHING.
IS THAT, DOES THAT RUN THROUGHEVERYBODY'S HEAD?
>> YES.
THERE'S THIS STRANGE MOMENT ASAN ACTOR WHERE YOU THINK LIKE OH
I'M CONTROLLING ALL OF THIS ANDTHIS ONE TAKE.
AND IT'S LIKE IN THE BACK,BEHIND
THE CAMERA EVERYBODY'S GOINGLIKE OH HE THINKS HE'S
CONTROLLING IT.
AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY, IT'SA GREAT THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW,
THE MOVIE I DID, THIS IS WHERE IWORKED WITH THE DIRECTOR TWICE
IN A ROW.
WHAT I COULD SEE IS WHEN YOUMAKE A RELATIONSHIP IT'S ALL
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU HAVETO TRUST YOUR DIRECTOR.
YOU GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, YOUTHROW IT ALL OUT THERE AND THEY
CUT IT TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'SSORT OF IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRUST
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon:  HA HA.
HERE'S THE NICE THING ABOUT ME.
I'M ONLY DOING ONE MOVIE I CANDO WHATEVER I WANT.
>> I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOURMOVIE.
>> Jon:  THE GUY BACK THEREDOING IT IS A MAESTRO. HE'S
DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB.
PRISONERS, IT'S IN THE THEATERSON FRIDAY. JAKE GYLLENHAAL.
