>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW THAT WE
HAVE PREPARED IT FOR YOU WITH...
LOVE.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, JAY BAHADUR,
AUTHOR OF "THE PIRATES OF
SOMALIA."
BY THE WAY, "PIRATES OF
SOMALIA," WORST DISNEY LAND RIDE
EVER.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S A SMALL WORLD, PIRATES
OF...
(LAUGHTER).
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT,
RECENT WEEKS HAVE SEEN SUCH
DISCORD AND STRIFE HERE IN OUR
UNITED STATES.
OUR STAGNATING ECONOMY AND...
WHAT'S A WORSE WORD THAN
"STAGNATING" FOR A BROKEN
POLITICAL SYSTEM?
(BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S COST US OUR A.A.A. CREDIT
RATING.
BUT BEFORE WE GET TOO DOWN,
REMEMBER THAT IN SOME STILL
CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTRIES THE
THIRD "A" NOW APPARENTLY STANDS
FOR "ARSON."
LONDON IS ON FIRE!
DEAR GOD!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OVER
IN BRITAIN?
PLEASE TELL ME THE CLASH
REUNITED AND THEY'RE SHOOTING A
NEW ALBUM COVER?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLEASE?
WAIT, I'M... HOLD ON.
I'M BEING TOLD THAT IT'S NOT THE
CASE.
>> NEW VIOLENCE AND NEW FIRES
ARE BREAKING OUT AFTER A WEEKEND
OF MAYHEM.
>> FOR A THIRD TERRIBLE NIGHT
LONDON BURNS.
>> RIOTS IN BRITAIN SPREADING
BEYOND LONDON TO THREE OTHER
CITIES.
>> IT'S BEING CALLED THE BATTLE
FOR LONDON.
>> IT'S BEING CALLED MINDLESS
VIOLENCE.
>> Jon: IT'S BEEN CALLED THE
HOODIE BLITZ.
(LAUGHTER)
THE REGRETTABLE HULLABALOO.
(LAUGHTER)
BEEF YELLINGTON.
(LAUGHTER)
AND, SHOCKINGLY, A RIGHT SODDING
FUSTER IN THE GOOLIES.
(LAUGHTER)
THE RIOTS...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
YOU LIKE THAT?
BULLOCKS!
THE RIOTS WERE SPARKED BY A
SUSPICIOUS POLICE SHOOTING OF A
YOUNG MAN BUT AS THEY SPREAD
THROUGH LONDON AND BEYOND BECAME
MORE ROOTED IN PROLETARIAN RAGE.
OR THE DESIRE TO GET THINGS
STORES NORMALLY MAKE YOU PAY
FOR.
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE
ABOUT AN AN FENWAY PARKKY IN THE
U.K.: EVEN THEIR LOOTERS QUEUE
UP.
(IN AN ENGLISH ACCENT)
"DO YOU MIND IF I GET THAT
TELLLY?
AFTER YOU."
HOW BAD HAS THE SITUATION
GOTTEN?
>> PRIME MINISTER CAM REASON
CAME BACK FROM VACATION TO
ATTEND TO THIS.
SOME SAY ESHED HAVE DONE THAT A
COUPLE DAYS AGO.
>> WHY DID IT TAKE THREE NIGHTS
OF CONSECUTIVE RIOTS AND
LOOTING?
>> Jon: THREE NIGHTS OF
CONSECUTIVE RIOTING AND LOOTING
WHEN THE ONLY THOUGHT THAT THE
CITY WOULD BURN FOR ONE NIGHT...
(LAUGHTER).
IT'S A MIRACLE.
PERHAPS CAMERON HAS RETURNED TO
CELEBRATE HOOLIGANIKACHUH, THE
FESTIVAL OF FIGHTS.
(LAUGHTER)
I APOLOGIZE, JEWS WILL GO OUT OF
OUR WAY TO CREATE A NEW HOLIDAY.
WE VERY MUCH LIKE STAYING HOME
FROM WORK.
SO TOUGH TIMES IN BRITAIN FOR,
WELL, NEARLY ALL BUSINESSES.
NOT ALL, SOME BUSINESSES.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, SEEING AN EMERGENCY
GLASS REPAIR VAN DRIVING THROUGH
A RIOT-TORN NEIGHBORHOOD RIFE
WITH FLYING ROCKS, NOT THE SAME
WITHOUT MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT.
(PLAYING THE THEME FROM "BENNY
HILL")
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
BUT WHILE EMERGENCY PLATE GLASS
SALES MAY BE BOOMING, THE REST
OF ENGLAND AND, IN FACT, ALL OF
EUROPE'S ECONOMY IS STILL IN
DEEP TROUBLE.
>> FEARS OF LOOMING ECONOMIC
CATASTROPHE IN EUROPE.
>> A CRISIS OVER DEBT IS
ACCELERATING THROUGHOUT THE
EUROZONE.
>> INVESTORS ARE SCRAMBLING
STOKED LARGELY BY FEARS THAT
ITALY AND SPAIN ARE TEETERING ON
THE BRINK OF GOING BROKE.
>> Jon: WHAT?
WAIT!
WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
WHO ARE YOU?
THE DOUBLE PHONE?
THAT'S NOT... WHO'S THAT... YOU
KNOW, THAT'S CLEARLY... TO BE
FAIR, NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY DOES
ON PURPOSE, YOU KNOW?
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT?
IF THE GUY IN THE DOUBLE PHONE
IS TALKING TO TWO PEOPLE AND IT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STOCK.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT, THE KEY TO TURKEY
IS BRINING.
THAT'S RIGHT.
NO, YOU HANG UP.
(LAUGHTER)
NO, YOU HANG UP.
OF COURSE, THERE IS A WAY OUT.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.
>> THE ONE TO WATCH HERE IS
REALLY THE GERMAN INDEX.
>> ALL THE EYES ARE ON GERMANY.
WHO'S GOING TO SAVE THE EURO.
>> WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE ARE
WORRIES ABOUT TRANSFERS OF
WEALTH FROM GERMANY TO THE OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
>> IT'S ALL ON GERMANY'S
SHOULDERS.
>> Jon: WE NEED GERMANY TO
SAVE EUROPE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE'RE (BLEEP)ED!
WE'RE TOTALLY (BLEEP)ED!
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
WE CAN'T!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
NO, YOU HANG UP.
(LAUGHTER)
