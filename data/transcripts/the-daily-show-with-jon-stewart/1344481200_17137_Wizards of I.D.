>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT,
INCLUDING A VISIT FROM AN EXCITING NEW, FRESH, YOUNG,
COMEDIAN, CHRISTOPHER ROCK.
( LAUGHTER ).
I EXPECT BIG THINGS FROM HIM.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AMERICA, FOLKS.
THESE ARE TROUBLED TIMES.
IN THIS MAJESTIC LAND.
( LAUGHTER ) BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY WHICH STANDS OUT,
PERHAPS ABOVE ALL OTHERS-- VOTER FRAUD.
HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM?
DO WE KNOW HOW BIG A PROBLEM IT IS?
>> Jon:  I'M GOING TO SAY IT'S BIGGER THAN RINGWORM.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND LESS THAN BIEBER FEVER.
( LAUGHTER ) ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE HAD A VOTER FRAUD PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> WE HAVE A VOTER FRAUD PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  I STAND CREBTED.
IS IT PROVEN?
>> IT'S A PROVEN PROBLEM, A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  WELL, I HOPE WE HAVE OUR BEST PEOPLE ON IT.
>> NOW TO THE FOX NEWS VOTER FRAUD UNIT.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
>> Jon:  YES, CONSERVATIVES AND THEIR MEDIA DIVISION ARE UP IN ARMS OVER VOTER FRAUD, AND
THIS YEAR ALMOST ENTIRELY IN SWING STATES WITH REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURES, THEY ARE DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
>> A LOT OF THESE STATES, SWING STATES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE PASSED VOTER I.D. AND VOTER
SUPPRESSION LAWS.
>> NEW VOTER I.D. LAWS IN TEXAS,
TENNESSEE, KANSAS, WISCONSIN.
>> Jon:  PENSYLLA-TUCKY, ARC ANBAMMA, FLORALINEA.
AND NEW OHIO.
OR NEW HIGHO.
STATES ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COMBAT VOTER FRAUD THROUGH STRATEGIES LIKE PURGING
VOTER ROLES AND REQUIRING PHOTO I.D.s, EVEN THOUGH A STUDY BY A GROUP THAT SUPPORTS THE LAWS,
THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION-- WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IF YOU EVER JUST WANT TO SMOKE SOME CIGARS AND PLAY SOME GOLF WITH SOME RULE DOUCHEBAGS--
( LAUGHTER ) ...THERE YOU GO.
ANYWAY, THEY SAID THIS --
>> THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN LAWYERS ONLY FOUND 340 CASES OF VOTER FRAUD OVER A 10-YEAR
PERIOD IN ALL OF AMERICA.
>> Jon:  OH, MY GOD!
( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ALMOST...
.7 CASES PER STATE PER YEAR.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND IT ALSO INCLUDES REGISTRATION FRAUD LIKE A MICKEY MOUSE PETITION.
BUT STILL, EVEN PENNSYLVANIA,
WHICH IS NOW DEFENDING ITS PHOTO I.D. LAW IN COURT SAID THIS --
>> THE STATE ADMITS IT IS "NOT AWARE OF ANY INCIDENTS OF IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD IN PENNSYLVANIA.
IN ADDITION, THE STATE SAYS IT HAS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD IS LIKELY
TO OCCUR IN DECEMBER 2012 IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PHOTO I.D. LAWS.
>> Jon:  I REST MY CASE,
YOUR HONOR.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
THIS WON'T STOP IT.
I THINK YOU CAN SEE WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW.
( LAUGHTER ) NEXT UP, LEIBER LAWS FOR
