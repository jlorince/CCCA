>> Jon: THERE IS NO WAYIN THAT TIME THEY TOOK A
REAL QUESTION.
IT TOOK LONGER TO SAY THEWORDS, HELLO, I HAVE A
QUESTION.
AT THIS POINT, I'M NOTREALLY SURE YOU'RE IN
EGYPT.
LOOK AT THESE GUYS.
ARE THEY IN A VACUUM? IS THATWHERE THEY FAKED THE MOON
LANDING?

IS THIS A HOSTAGE VIDEO.
THEY ALL LOOK LIKE THEY'REAFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO
GET MUSLIM ON THEM.
NOT THAT THERE APPEARS TO BEANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM.
