>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN.
HIS UPCOMING SPECIAL FOR COMEDY CENTRAL IS CALLED "DL HUGHLEY: THE ENDANGERED LIST."
>> WE'RE CHECKING SIGNATURES TO GET BLACK PEOPLE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST.
>> I'M SORRY.
WHAT?
>> IT'S TO PUT THE BLACK MAN ON THE ENGLAND DANGERED SPECIES LIST.
>> THE BLACK MAN?
YOU
>> YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE BLACK MAN?
DO YOU WANT THE SAVE YOURSELF BUT NOT IN LIKE A JESUS WAY.
>> ARE YOU [BLEEPED] KIDDING ME?
>> REST UP.
TIME TO PUSH SOME BIG OLD WHITE BUTTONS.
>> DO YOU HATE BLACK PEOPLE?
>> WHAT?
DO YOU LIKE BLACK PEOPLE?
>> YEAH.
>> DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF BLACK FRIENDS?
>> YEAH.
>> YOU DO?
HOW MANY?
>> Jon: DL HUGHLEY.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIEND.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
>> LIKE EIGHT YEARS AGO I WAS PLAYING GOLF IN SAN JOSE, AND I HIT A BALL INTO THIS WET REEDY AREA, AND THE MARSHAL CAME UP
AND SAID IF YOU GO IN THAT AREA AND YOU HURT EITHER THE LIZARD AND ITS HABITAT, IT'S $50,000 AND A YEAR FINE.
AND I WAS LIKE, MAN, BLACK PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE THOSE KIND OF PROTECTIONS.
WE SHOULD LIVE LIKE THE GEICO LIZARD.
SO I JUST WENT.
IT TOOK ME EIGHT YEARS THE...
YOU WALK TO A NETWORK AND SAY, I WANT THE SAVE THE BLACK MAN, THAIK -- THEIR LIKE, YOU'RE KIDDING RIGHT?
SO IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS.
I MET WITH A COUPLE CATS FROM THE SHOW HERE, AND WE JUST WENT OUT THERE AND COMEDY CENTRAL BOUGHT IT.
WE HAD A GOOD TIME DOING IT.
>> Jon: DID IT HELP WE HAD THREE DAILY OWE SHOW PRODUCERS WITH YOU, MILES, TIM AND THEY'RE USED TO GOING UP AND ASKING
PEOPLE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS.
>> YEAH.
IT WAS WEIRD WHEN WE TALKED TO THE NEO-NAZI AND ASKED HIM TO SAVE THE BLACK MAN.
HE WAS...
>> Jon: HOW DID THAT GO?
>> WELL, HE NEEDS US.
LIKE HATING... LIKE JUST HATING JEWS AND MEXICANS IS NOT ENOUGH.
>>
>> Jon: IT'S IN THE A MEAL.
IT'S IN THE A MEAL.
IT'S LIKE A COCKTAIL FRANK.
YOU NEED MORE.
>> RIGHT.
YOU DO.
>> Jon: SO WHAT WAS THE...
WHAT WERE THE GROUPS THAT WERE MOST FOR THIS?
WHAT WERE THE GROUPS THAT WERE...
>> ACTUALLY, THERE WAS ACTUALLY NO ONE EXCEPT ME THAT WAS FOR IT.
>> Jon: YOU WERE ALONE.
>> I WAS MAN ON AN ISLAND.
BUT EVENTUALLY, I THINK WE TALKED TO A GUY FROM THE PRIVATE PRISON INDUSTRY, AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY... THE PRIVATE PRISON
AND PRIVATE PRISONS NEED BLACK PEOPLE.
IF IT WERE A CROP, WE'D BE THE SOYBEAN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SURE.
IT'S A VERY POPULAR VIEW RIGHT NOW.
IT'S A VERY POPULAR LEGUME.
>> THEY CAN PICK THE PRISONS THEY WANT TO INHABIT, AND THEY WANT THEM YOUNG AND THEY WANT THEM HEALTHY AND THEY WANT THEM
TO HAVE LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCES.
SO WE TALKED TO THEM.
THEN WE TALKED TO YOUNG GANGBANGERS.
>> THE PRIVATE PRISON SYSTEM SELECTS THE TYPE THEY WANT THAT WILL GENERATE THE MOST MONEY.
>> RIGHT.
SO WE TALKED TO YOUNG GANG MENTION IN L.A. WHO KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GO TO JAIL.
WE GOT SOME STOCK IN THE COMPANY SO IF THEY GO TO JAIL...
[LAUGHTER]
THEN THEY'RE NOT JUST PRISONERS, THEY'RE SHAREHOLDERS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THAT WAS SOME PEOPLE THAT HAD A PROBLEM... I DO REALIZE WE COULD BE THE ONLY SPECIES WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN ITS OWN DEMISE.
YOU NEVER SAW THE T-RED SOX SHOOTING DOWN ANOTHER T-RED SOX.
>> Jon: THERE WAS NOT T-RE X ON T-REX VIOLENCE.
WE TRIED NOT TO MAKE MORE PEOPLE CULPABLE.
97% OF THE BLACK PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY OTHER BLACK P.J.
EDUCATION.
THE DINOSAUR HAD THE ICE AGE.
THE EDUCATION I THINK IS HAVING A SIMILAR IMPACT ON YOUNG BROTHERS.
SO IT WAS INTERESTING AND FUNNY AND KIND OF JUST AN IRONIC LOOK AT HOW WE SEE THINGS.
LIKE LITERALLY WE CARE MORE ABOUT... IF TRAYVON MARTIN WERE A SPOTTED OWL, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE FELT MORE SYMPATHY FOR HIM.
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ILLEGAL.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED I THINK TO STAND YOUR GROUND AGAINST OWLS.
IF IT'S AN OWL, I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET THE [BLEEPED] OUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
>> I THINK AN OWL WITH A HOODIE ON IS JUST AS DANGEROUS.
>> Jon: THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.
PROBABLY TRUEMENT
>> WHAT CRACKED ME UP ABOUT THE HOODIE THING, I WAS TALKING TO A GUY, AND HE SAID, "HE HAD A HOODIE ON."
I REMEMBER WHEN BLACK PEOPLE WERE SCARED OF PEOPLE WEARING HOODIES.
>> Jon: IT ALL COMES AROUND.
THEY'LL GET THERE.
THEY'LL GET THERE.
>> SO IT IS JUST IRON TICK WAY WE VIEW THINGS.
I THINK PRIMARILY PEOPLE HAVE...
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING HAPPEN TO A YOUNG BLACK CAT WHERE PEOPLE SAY, WOW, I FEEL SYMPATHETIC.
IT'S FOR THE SAME REASON NO ONE FEELS SYMPATHY FOR THE SHARK.
THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE SHARK, SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPEN, THEY DON'T CARE.
>>
>> Jon: INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
AND I KNOW THOSE GUYS WERE THRILLED TO HAVE WORKED WITH YOU.
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A SPECTACULAR PROJECT.
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU BACK.
WHEN I USED TO SEE YOU ON CNN AND YOU GOT OUT OF THERE, I THOUGHT, DO YOU HAVE SURVIVOR'S GUILT LEAVING CNN.
WHEN YOU LEFT, I'M THE LAST GUY ON THE LIFEBOAT, I'M GETTING OUT.
>> I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT.
>> Jon: LISTEN, MAN, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOUR STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GREAT.
DL HUGHLEY, "THE ENGLAND DANGERED LIST" APPEARS ON COMEDY CENTRAL.
DL HUGHLEY.
