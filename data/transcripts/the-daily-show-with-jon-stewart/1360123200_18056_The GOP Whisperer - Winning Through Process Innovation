WHICH WOULD CUT THEM WHICH SOUNDS (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS THE KIND OF MESSAGING STRATEGY THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD IN PLACE FOR YEARS.
MAYBE THIS STRATEGY IS STARTING TO HAVE DIMINISHING RETURNS.
MAYBE THEY'VE HIT PEAK LUMPS.
THERE'S ENDLESS RESERVE OF WORD-IPULAITIONS HAS RUN ITS COURSE.
IS THERE A WAY TO GAIN ADVANTAGE.
>> IT'S TIME FOR A NEW REPUBLICAN THAT TALK LIKE ADULTS.
>> Jon: LIKE WITH CURSE WORDS.
LET'S GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON THE (bleep) TRACK!
OH, YEAH I'M (bleep) BOBBY JINDAL BITCHES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WAIT, HOLD ON.
I DON'T THINK I DID THAT RIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
>> WE'VE GOT TO STOP BEING THE STUPID PARTY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: SO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WAY YOU ARE JUST THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY YOU ARE.
INSTEAD OF COMING UP WITH MESSAGING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE WOMEN'S
HAVE BEGINAS HAVE BUILT IN DEFENSE SYSTEMS THAT REPEL ILLINOIS-GOTTEN SPERM WHAT COULD
YOU TRY IS NOT BELIEVING THAT WOMEN'S VAGINAS HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAKES ME WANT TO STROKE MY CHIN PIEWBS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
A FUNDAMENTAL RETHINKING OF THE MORE EXTREME AND INTERKUWAITED THINKING THAT FORM THE BACKBONE
OF REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATSFORM.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU COULD DO.
THAT ANYBODY WITH A DIFFERENT IDEA?
>> REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS IN KEY STATES TO CHANGE THE WAY WE ELECT THE PRESIDENT ARE
APPROVED, THIS WEEK'S INAUGURAL.
>> REPEAT AFTER ME.
>> PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND.
>> WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS:
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THE ELECTRIC ELECTORAL MATH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT WHY DOES HE STILL
GET MICHELLE OBAMA?
THAT SEEMS --
[LAUGHTER]
-- HEARD OF WINNER TALK ALL BUT PLEASE S.
SOME WOULD CALL A PROPOSAL LIKE THAT CHEATING.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS, BUT WHY NOT TAKE A PAGE FROM THE PLAYBOOK HERE.
THE LANGUAGE ERROR IS CHEATING.
LET'S ADJUST THAT TO WINNING TO PROCESS INNOVATION.
ETHICS MODULATED DEMOCRACY IMPROVEMENT.
TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK AND INTELLIGENCE, REALLY, TO REMAIN STUPID.
WE'LL BY RIGHT
