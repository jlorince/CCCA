THE PROMOTION OF THE BASIC
CIVIL RIGHT FOR A LARGE
GROUP OF PEOPLE.
BUT OBVIOUSLY OUR MAIN STORY
IS THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS
TO THE NATION LAST NIGHT.
HIS FIRST SINCE THAT NIGHT
TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN HE
INFORMED US THAT HE HAD
PERSONALLY KILLED OSAMA BIN
LADEN WITH HIS BARE HANDS.
AND HE IS WALKING DOWN THE
SAME CARPET AGAIN!
I WONDER IF WE GOT HITLER
THIS TIMEçó!
>> WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE
SURGE AT WEST,rPOINT, WE SET
CLEAR OBJECTIVES TO REFOCUS
ON AL QAEDA, TO REVERSE THE
TALIBAN'S MOMENTUM, AND
TRAIN AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES
TO DEFEND THEIR OWN COUNTRY.
WE ARE MEETING OUR GOALS.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD,
AFGHANISTAN WAR!
IT'S FINALLY OVER, TEN
YEARS.
CAN SOMEONE GET ME A NURSE
TO KISS IN THE STREET?
I CANwTi BELIEVE-- TELL ME
MORE!
>> STARTING NEJt MONTH WE
WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE
10,000 OF OUR TROOPS FROM
AFGHANISTAN BY THE END OF
THIS YEAR.
AND WE WILL BRING HOME A
TOTAL OF 33,000 TROOPS BY
NEXT SUMMER.
>> Jon: HUH?
THAT'S IT?
CAME OUT TO ANNOUNCE THAT
THE TROOPS, THAT YOU SENT TO
AFGHANISTAN A YEAR AND A
HALF AGO ARE GOING TO BE
INCREMENTALLY REMOVED FROM
THAT COUNTRY OVER THEçó NEXT
YEAR AND A HALF?
PUTTING US AT A TROOP
COMMITMENT LEVEL STILL ABOVE
THE ONE THAT WAS THERE WHEN
YOU TOOK OFFICE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT NOTHING BUT
DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO WALK
ALL THE WAY DOWN THE [BLEEP]
HALLWAY TO DO THAT?
COULDN'T YOU JUST SHOUT IT
AS YOU WERE WALKING BY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HEY, WE'RE GOING TO
TRIM BACK A BIT ON ONE OF
OUR WARS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: FYI.
JUST DO IT AS A FACEBOOK
STATUS UPDATE.
YOU REALLY-- YOU HAD TO DO
THIS AS A NATIONWIDE
ADDRESS-- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW IT
PLAYED ON FOX, THE
CONSERVATIVES, THE PORTION
OF THE COUNTRY WHOSE VIEWS
ARE NEVER-- ALL RIGHT, JUST
PLAY IT.
>> WHY DO I SEE POLITICS ALL
OVER THIS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PLAYING
POLITICS.
>> THIS IS 100% POLITICAL.
>> CLEARLY MEANT TO MOLLIFY
THE ANTI-WAR LEFT.
>> HE NEEDS TO APPEASE THE
LEFT WING OF HIS OWN PARTY.
>> I KNOW HE'S GOT TO
APPEASE THOSE MORON LIKE THE
CODE PINK CHICKS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: TO ME THE DEAD GIVE
AWAY, THE DENTIST DOESN'T
KNOW MUCH ABOUT CODE PINK
ISN'T THAT HE CALLED THEM
CHICK, BUT THAT HE THINKS
THEY CAN BE APPEASED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SO THE SPEECH WAS LIKE RED
METAPHOR THE LEFT OR SHOULD
I SAY TOFURKEY, FOR THE
LEFT.
MAN, FOR THE LEFT.
THAT SPEECH MUST HAVE BEEN
LIKE FINDING OUT THAT A
VOLUME CO-- VOLVO AND SUB RO
MATED AND GIVEN BIRTH TO A
RECUMBENT BICYCLE, RIGHT?
>> I'M DISAPPOINTED.
REMOVING THE 33,000 TROOPS
IN OVER A YEAR IN OUR BUDGET
CRISIS IS NOT NEARLY GOOD
ENOUGH.
>> IT'S A NO-WIN POLICY.
>> IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT
ENOUGH.
>> IT'S GOING AT A SLOWER
PACE THAN I THINK IS
NECESSARY.
>> AFGHANISTAN WAR IS GOING
ON TEN YEARS NOW, IF IT WERE
A KID IT WOULD BE IN THE
FIFTH GRADE.
>> Jon: YES, THIS WAR IS
LIKE A TEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD
AND THAT'S WHY WE MUST END
IT -- WAIT, HOLD ON.
(LAUGHTER)
SIXTH GRADE SAY TOUGH YEAR,
I WILL SAY.
SO IT SEEMS THAT BARACK
OBAMA HAS PULLED OFF AN
INCREDIBLE FEAT.
HE HAS GIVEN A SPEECH NOBODY
LIKED.
SOMEHOW HE HAS FOUND AND
TOUCHED AMERICA ON OUR
ANTI-G-SPOT.
BUT I BELIEVE THIS SPEECH
CONTAINED A STRONG HINT OF
THE PROBLEM THIS PRESIDENT
IS FACING AS HE SEEKS TO
CREATE THE OBAMA DOCTRINE
FOR THE WAR ON TERRORISM.
>> WE MUST CHART A MORE
CENTERED COURSE.
LIKE GENERATIONS BEFORE WE
MUST EMBRACE AMERICA'S
SINGULAR WAR IN THE COURSE
OF HUMAN EVENTS AM BUT WE
MUST BE AS PRAGMATIC AS WE
ARE PASSIONATE, AS STRATEGIC
AS WE ARE RESOLUTE.
WHEN THREATENED, WE MUST
RESPOND WITH FORCE.
BUT WHEN THAT FORCE CAN BE
TARGETED, WE NEED NOT DEPLOY
LARGE ARMIES OVERSEAS.
>> Jon: SEE THERE'S THE
DILEMMA, BECAUSE WE'VE
ALREADY DEPLOYED LARGE AMIES
OVERSEAS.
WE'VE ALREADY DONE IT.
THE OBAMA DOCTRINE APPEARS
TO BE IN THE FUTURE I WILL
TRY NOT TO GET US EMBROILED
IN SO MANY MONEY AND LIFE
SUCKING CLUSTER [BLEEP] LIKE
THE ONES WE APPEAR TO BE
EMBROILED IN AT THE PRESENT
AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET OUT OF.
THE BUSH DOCTRINE IS CLEAR.
YOU GOT TERRORISTS, WE'RE
GOING TO GET YOU.
BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A
GAME OF TERRORIST
WHACK-A-MOLE.
AND IT COST $9.7 BILLION A
MONTH TO COVER ONLY TWO
HOLES THAT YOU CAN NEVER
LEAVE.
SOMEWHAT UNSUSTAINABLE.
OBAMA'S MAKING THE CASE THAT
THE FUTURE DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE THIS WAY.
>> WHEN INNOCENTS ARE BEING
SLAUGHTERED AND GLOBAL
SECURITY ENDANG ARED, WE
DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
STANDING IDLY BY OR ACTING
ON OUR OWN.
INSTEAD WE MUST RALLY
INTERNATIONAL ACTION WHICH
WE'RE DOING IN LIBYA WHERE
WE DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE
SOLDIER ON THE GROUND.
>> SEE, HE'S SAYING LET'S
NOT PLAY WHACK-A-MOLE, LET'S
PLAY BUCK HUNTER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> JUST STAND BACK AND WAIT
FOR A DICTATOR LIKE MICHAEL
JACKSON TO WALK THROUGH THE
FOREST AND THEN-- BUT AGAIN
WE CAN ONLY PUT A NEW
STRATEGY IN PLACE ONCE WE
HAVE ENDED OUR CURRENT
ENTANGLEMENT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M
HERE TO ANNOUNCE TONIGHT
THAT I BELIEVE WE MAY HAVE
FOUND THE SOLUTION BURIED IN
SOME OF THE POST SPEECH
COMMENTARY.
>> THEY HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED
FIGHTING SEASONS.
>> HAVING ALL THE SURGE
FORCES LEAVE BY NEXT SUMMER
IS GOING TO COMPROMISEçó NEXT
SUMMER'S FIGHTING SEE
SOW-- SEASON.
>> THE FIGHTING SEASON
BEGINS IN THE SPRING WHEN
THEY FINISH HARVESTING THE
OPIUM.
AND IT ENDS IN THE FALL WHEN
THEY NEED TO BE UNHARVESTING
THE MARIJUANA.
>> SEE WE HERE IN AMERICA
HAVE FOUR SEASON, WINTER,
SPRING, SUMMER, FALL.
IN AFGHANISTAN TWO SEASONS,
FIGHTING SEASON BE, AND DRUG
HARVESTING SEASON.
(LAUGHTER)
DOCTRINE IF YOU WILL TO
WINNING THIS WAR, WE MUST AS
A NATION DEVICE A NARCOTIC
THAT RIPEENS DURING THEIR
SUMMER DRUG HARVESTING L
LULL.
PCP-EANUTS, IF YOU WILL.
METH AM AT THE TIMEA MELON,
NO, THAT ROTS TOO EASYY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I
PRESENT TO YOU THE KEY TO
ENDURING PEACE AND STABILITY
IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS TO
COME, A CROP AS ADDICTIVE AS
HEARTY, BEHOLD, CRACKTUS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
