REAL QUICK, THESE ARE JUST SOME SENATE AND HOUSE AS YOU REMEMBER MCCASKILL IS GOING UP AGAINST
TODD AKIN.
IT LOOKS LIKE IN MISSOURI MA MCCASKILL HAS LEGIT ME RAPED TODD AKIN.
ELECTORALLY SPEAKING OBVIOUSLY.
IN INDIANA JOE DONNELLY HAS DEFEATED RICHARD MURDOCK, THE REPUBLICAN.
THAT IS A DEMOCRATIC PICK UP.
AND IN ILLINOIS THIS IS INTERESTING, TAMMY DO YOU DO YOU RECOLLECT -- DUCK WORTH HAS
DEFEATED JOE WALSH.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER BIG ONE.
BY THE WAY YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE RACE.
THE FIRST PERSON TO 270 WINS THE ABILITY TO BOMB IRAN.
AND RIGHT NOW OBAMA IS AT 243 AND MITT ROMNEY IS AT 203.
SO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT.
[CROWD CHEERING]
DONATIONS TRICKLING IN FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
IT'S MAGICAL, THANK A LOT GUYS THANKS FOR JOINING US.
TONIGHT'S RESULTS, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU THINK.
>> JON TONIGHT'S RESULTS HAVE CAUSED A SEISMIC SHIFT?
WHAT WE'RE FORECASTING FOR THE 2016 ELECTION.
THE REAL WINNER TONIGHT LOOKS TO BE HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS NOW PROJECTING PAT 68% CHANCE OF
VICTORY --
>>
[CROWD CHEERING]
>> THAT'S UP FROM 54% JUST A FEW HOURS AGO.
OBVIOUSLY PREMATURE TO CALL THE 2016 ELECTION BUT I THINK THROUGH DEMANDS WE HAVE AT LEAST
EXAMINED SOME VICE PRESIDENTIAL OPTIONS.
TONIGHT MITT ROMNEY RECEIVED VERY LITTLE MINORITY SUPPORT.
WE'RE TALKING JIMMY BUFFET CONCERT LEVEL.
SO THAT'S CLEARLY GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOME COFFEE IN THAT CREAM.
WOULDN'T HURT TO COUNTER HILLARY WITH A WOMAN EITHER.
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING CONDALEESA RICE OR PERHAPS MEDEA.
>> NO JON THE CHARACTER FROM GREEK TRAGEDY WHO MURDERS BOTH OF HER CHILDREN.
THAT MEDEA.
>> Jon:  WHAT ABOUT HILLARY'S VICE PRESIDENT.
>> SHE'LL NEED TO REACH OLDER WHITE MALE VOTERS.
SO THE TWO LEADING VP CONTENDERS ARE A 1962 CHEVY EMPALA AND A CAN OF BEER.
>> Jon:  I UNDERSTAND.
>> LASTLY IN 2016 WITH THE UNITED STATES SPLIT INTO TWO TERRITORIES, NEW REAL AMERICA.
>> Jon:  WAIT LET ME GUESS THE BLUE STATES ARE NOW THE UNITED STATES OF OVERSENSITIVITY.
>> THAT'S NOT FUNNY, JON.
>> Jon:  IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY.
>> NO THAT'S ACTUALLY THE NAME OF THE NEW BLUE STATE COUNTRY.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, JON.
>> THEY KNEW YOU WOULD MAKE FUN OF THEM.
>> Jon:  I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
>> 2016 ONCE AGAIN AND I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO OHIO OR AS IT'S
KNOWN IN ITS BIFURCATED STATE IS OHIO AND OHIO.
>> Jon:  I GUESS THAT'S, THE LAST ONE IS THE BLUE STATE GAY ONE.
>> THAT'S NOT
