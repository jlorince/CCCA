SAD.
YOU KNOW, WE FORGET SOMETIMES...
I CERTAINLY DO-- THAT THESE
PEOPLE ARE HUMAN.
AND THAT'S THE LESSON THAT IS
GOING TO STAY WITH ME.
UNTIL I TURN BACK TO THE
CAMERA OVER THERE AND DO A
LITTLE BIT ON THE JOHN EDWARDS'
STORY.
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
ANYMORE.
IT'S KILLING ME.
SO REMEMBER THIS GUY?
HE LOST THE PRESIDENCY.
HE LOST THE VICE PRESIDENCY.
HE WENT ON TELEVISION, LIED
ABOUT HAVING AN AFFAIR, AND HE
WENT ON TELEVISION AND
ADMITTED THE AFFAIR BUT LIED
ABOUT HAVING A BABY WITH THE
AFFAIR.
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED LIKE JOHN
EDWARDS HAD IT ALL.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
CAN WE SCROLL THE PROMPTER.
AH!
THANK YOU.
IT SEEMED LIKE JOHN EDWARDS
COULDN'T SINK ANY LOWER.
THANK YOU.
MY FAULT.

WELL, EDWARDS IS BEING ACCUSED
OF ILLEGALLY... (LAUGHING)

NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING
SARCASTIC.
EDWARDS IS BEING ACCUSED OF
ILLEGALLY USING NEARLY A
MILLION DOLLARS IN CAMPAIGN
FUNDS TO KEEP HIS MISS STRESS
OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE.
IT TURNS OUT GOVERNMENT HAS A
PRETTY WEAK CASE AGAINST HIM
AND HE HAS SURPRISING ALLIES
SUPPORTING THAT NOTION.
>> EVEN SOME WHO FIND EDWARDS'
BEHAVIOR DESPICABLE QUESTION
THE STRENGTH OF THIS CASE.
>> I THINK HE'S A
REPREHENSIBLE PERSON BUT NOT
EVERY SCUM OR LIAR IS A
CRIMINAL.
>> I THINK JOHN EDWARDS IS A
LOUSY HUMAN BEING BUT I THINK
THIS IS A REALLY LOUSY AND
FLIMSY CRIMINAL CASE.
>> Jon: THANKS FOR THE
SUPPORT.
NO, NO, NO, LET ME CONTINUE.
I BELIEVE IN YOUR INNOCENCE
BUT YOU ARE, IF I MAY, A PIECE
OF (BEEP) TOOK A (BEEP) AND
THEN THAT (BEEP) THREW UP.
AND THAT THROW-UP THEN TOOK A
(BEEP), THAT IS YOU.
ALTHOUGH YOU ARE PERFECTLY
