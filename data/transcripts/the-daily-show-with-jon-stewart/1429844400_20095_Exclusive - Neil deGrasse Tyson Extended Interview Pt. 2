>> Jon: THE, THE -- SO WHAT--WHAT-- WHAT HAS LIT A
FIRE FOR YOU SCIENTIFICALLYRIGHT NOW?
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLESOMETHING IN YOUR POCKET THAT
GIVES YOU THE PASSION, THESPARK.
WHAT IS IT IN THE SCIENCE WORLDRIGHT NOW THAT'S GOT YOU THERE?
>> I'VE GOT TO SAY IT'S NOT EVENABOUT SCIENCE.
IT'S-- IT'S THE WARMTH-- THERISE OF THE WARMTH THAT I SEE IN
THE PUBLIC FOR LEARNING ABOUTSCIENCE.
>> Jon:  OH, REALLY?
>> AND THE EXCITEMENT THATBRINGS.
>> Jon: YOU FEEL THEDIFFERENCE?
>> I FEEL. IT.
OH MAN.
OH
>> Jon:  THAT'S INTERESTING.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.
IT'S NOT JUST THIS IS SCIENCE,LET ME LEARN ABOUT IT.
IT'S THAT THERE IS A CULTURETHAT THINKS ABOUT SCIENCE AND
LIKES SCIENCE -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT IS RISINGUP IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND IT'S EXEMPLIFIED BY --LIKE THE GEEKOSPHERE LED THAT.
AND LOOK AT HOW MANYPEOPLE SHOW UP AT COMIC-CON.
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'REALL DRESSED UP IN WEIRD WAYS,
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEYGO HOME, THEY KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEENFANTASY AND FACT.
AND SO I -- AND, AND HUNDREDS OFTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTEND
THESE CONFERENCES --
>> Jon:  DO YOU-- LET MEASK YOU A QUESTION.
BECAUSE FROM THE TIME THAT YOUSTARTED TILL NOW, WHAT-- WHAT--
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ANYFACTORS THAT HELPED BRING
THAT ENTHUSIASM TO THE FORE?
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THATHAS CHANGED, SOMEBODY WHO HAS
BROUGHT AN ENERGY TO IT, THATMAYBE--
( LAUGHTER )THAT MAYBE WASN'T THERE BEFORE?
SOMEBODY WHO HAS CHAMPIONEDSCIENCE, WHO HAS BROUGHT THEIR
PASSION--( LAUGHTER )
>> ARE YOU DONE?
>> Jon: SOMEBODY-- SOMEBODY WHOMAYBE RUNS THE
HAYDEN PLANETARIUM? CAN YOUTHINK OF ANYONE?
>> OKAY, SO I HAVE A VERY-- ITHINK I HAVE A VERY LEVEL-HEADED
ASSESSMENT OF LIFE AND SOCIETYAND CULTURE --
>> Jon: YES. YES.
>> AND I SEE FORCES THAT I HAVENOTHING TO DO WITH.
LIKE THE FACT THAT THE TV SHOW"THE BIG BANG THEORY "IS THE
NUMBER ONE SHOW ON TELEVISION INANY GENRE.
YEAH, I HAD ONE CAMEO UTTERINGTHREE LINES, BUT IT'S IN ITS
NINTH SEASON OR EIGHTH SEASON.
AND IT'S BEEN RUNNING LONER THAN"THE JETSONS" AND THE ORIGINAL
"STAR TREK" COMBINED. OKAY?
SO SOMEBODY IS KEEPING THAT SHOWGOING, AND IT'S NOT JUST THE
GEEKS.
AND "C.S.I." HAS BEEN AROUND FORDECADES.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NOW IS GEEK, ISGEEK A WORD?
IS THAT SOMETHING I CAN USE ORONLY YOU GUYS CAN USE?
IS THAT -- HOW DOES THAT--
>> WELL, I'LL TELLYOU. IN THE OLD DAYS --
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I'M OLD ENOUGH TOREMEMBER THE OLD DAYS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IF YOU WERE A GEEK IN HIGHSCHOOL.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> YOU WERE THE ONE WHOGOT THE WEDGY BY THE
FOOTBALL QUARTERBACK.>> Jon: RIGHT.
YOU WERE THE ONEWHO WERE EXPLOITED --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> CALLED YOU FOUR-EYES,OR WHATEVER IT IS.
AND THEN THE QUARTERBACK LEARNEDTHAT THEY NEEDED YOU --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO FIX THEIR COMPUTER.
AND THEN THE STOCK VALUE OFGEEKS ROSE.
AND THEN CAME THE MOVIE "REVENGEOF THE NERDS."
>> Jon:  YES.
>> AND OKAY?>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND THEN PEOPLE SAW, OH, YOUCAN GET REVENGE USING YOUR
SMARTS. >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO I WASN'T MAKING, IWASN'T RUNNING THE PLANETARIUM
BACK THEN.
SO THIS HAS BEEN A SLOW RISE.
IN 2000, IN THE YEAR 2000, IGAVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH AT
MY HIGH SCHOOL, THE BRONXHIGH SCHOOL OF SCIENCE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND I TITLED THAT SPEECH"REVENGE OF THE NERDS."
THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLDIS THE PATRON SAINT OF NERDS,
BILL GATES.
SO THE WORLD IS DIFFERENTBECAUSE OF THIS.
BECAUSE WE ONLY ENTER THE FUTUREON THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
BROUGHT TO THIS WORLD BY THEGEEK-O-PHERE.
YES, I'M ON THAT LANDSCAPE.>> Jon: YES.
>> I'M THERE, YES.
YES. BUT I --
>> Jon:  LET ME ASK YOUTHIS--
>> IT COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED -->> Jon: WHEN YOU WENT BACK TO
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  WHAT HAPPENED?>> I'M GONNA LEAN IN TOO.
>> Jon: AT THE REUNION, WASTHERE ANY POINT WHEN YOU WENT--
DID BRONX SCIENCE HAVEA FOOTBALL TEAM?
>> NOT REALLY.
NO.
>> Jon: THERE IS GOES MYWHOLE REVENGE PHILOSOPHY.
>> OKAY.
I THOUGHT AT SOME POINT YOUWOULD FIND THE OLD HIGH
SCHOOL QUARTERBACK WHO GAVE YOUWEDGY AND GO UP TO HIM AND SAY
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF,"IN YOUR FACE MOTHER ( BLEEP )."
>> SO NO, I WAS NEVER ONE WHOGOT A WEDGY.
>> Jon: WELL, YOU, YOU WERE --WERE YOU A BIG DUDE?
>> YEAH, YEAH I WAS BIGGER THANMY GRADE WOULD HAVE INDICATED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND BY THE WAY, I HAD-- YOUKNOW, AS A GUY, THERE'S SOME
POINT IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOUIMAGINING YOURSELF AS A
SUPERHERO.>> Jon: YES.
>> YEAH, WE ALL -- IT'S KIND OFA RITES OF PASSAGE.
I IMAGINED MYSELF AS A GEEKPROTECTOR.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S NICE.
>> YEAH BECAUSE I WAS BIGGER ANDSTRONGER.
>> Jon:  YOU WERE LIKE THEBODY GUARD.
>> THE BODY GUARD.
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S NICE.( APPLAUSE )
>> NO, NO, SO I WOULD HEAR--THERE WOULD BE A GEEK KID
GETTING BEAT UP AND I WOULD JUSTSHOW UP AND JUST KICK SOME ASS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )I WAS-- I WAS CAPTAIN OF MY HIGH
SCHOOL WRESTLING TEAM, AND I WASUNDEFEATED.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> ALL RIGHT? SO-- AND I STUDIEDMARTIAL ARTS AND BRUCE LEE WAS
SOMEBODY YOU KNOW -- >> Jon: RIGHT RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> SO I WAS READY TO DO SOMEDAMAGE IF DAMAGE WAS NECESSARY.
SO THAT WAS MY-- THAT WAS MYFANTASY SUPERHERO ROLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. SO LET THAT BE ALESSON TO YOU KIDS OUT THERE.
VIOLENCE IS THE ANSWER.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.>> WHAT'S THAT?
>> Jon: AND I WANT TO GET YOURTAKE ON THIS BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE A LEARNED MAN.
YOU'RE AN EDUCATED MAN.
YOU'RE A MAN DEALS IN FACT ANDREALITY.
SUPERMAN VERSUS BATMAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )YOU KNOW, SO THERE'S BEEN SOME
DISCUSSION IN THE AUDIENCE -->> YEAH.
>> Jon: ABOUT WHO WOULD WIN,SUPERMAN VERSUS BATMAN.
WHO WOULD WIN, SUPERMANVERSUS BATMAN?
PERSONALLY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE AQUESTION-- BATSMAN JUST A GUY
WITH A NICE BELT.
SUPERMAN IS INVINCIBLE.
HE IS FASTER THAN A SPEEDINGBULLET.
HE CAN FLY.
HE CAN -- I JUST, I DON'TEVEN SEE IT AS A CONTEST.
>> I WOULD TELL YOU WHATIT'S ABOUT.
I WOULD TELL YOU.
I WOULD TELL YOU. OKAY?
YOU WHO DOES BATMAN REPORT TO?THE MAYOR --
>> Jon:  COMMISSIONERGORDON.
>> YEAH, YEAH. THECOMMISSIONER --
THE POLICE COMMISSIONER ANDULTIMATELY THE MAYOR.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> WHO DOES SUPERMAN REPORT TO?
>> Jon:  THE GUY IN THE ICECASTLE.
>> YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT. SO IT'S NOONE WE KNOW.
IT'S NO ONE WE HAVE ANY INSIGHTINTO.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
>> HE JUST BEHAVES IN WHATEVERWAY HE WANTS.
>> Jon:  YES.
>> SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WHATMIGHT MATTER IS THE PUBLIC
RECEPTION OF THE SUPERHERO ANDSUPERHERO'S CONDUCT.
AND IF BATMAN EXECUTES OURWISHES IN THE CITY AND SUPERMAN
DOES WHAT THE HELL HE WANTS,THAT'S-- THAT-- THAT'S A
CONFLICT. IT'S NOT A --
>> Jon: BUT I'M NOT SAYING WHOWINS THE BATTLE
OF PUBLIC RELATIONS.
>> IT'S NOT A CAGE MATCH. IT'S NOT A CAGE MATCH.
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
SUPERMAN WOULD WIPE HIS ASSWITH BATMAN.
>> Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I'MSAYING!
>> RIGHT. BUT -- BUT --
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING!
>> BUT YOU COULD LOSE THE BATTLEIN THE CAGE AND WIN THE BATTLE
OF PUBLIC OPINION.
AT THE END OF THE DAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  I MEAN, NOW YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT A BATTLE BETWEENGENERAL ZOD AND SUPERMAN.
I THINK THAT'S WHERE THAT MIGHTCOME INTO PLAY.
BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TOSUPERMAN AND BATMAN, I DON'T
THINK HE'S THINKING OH, BUT--AND BATMAN, BY THE WAY, IS NOT
SO GOOD ON THE PUBLICRELATIONS EITHER.
THEY THINK HE'S A VIGILANTE.
THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT SIDE HE'SON.
THERE'S LIKE A GUY RUNNINGAROUND IN A BATSUIT AT NIGHT.
>> YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.>> Jon: IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
>> YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
SO FOR ME THE MORE INTERESTINGCONTEST IS BATMAN VERSUS IRON
MAN BECAUSE THEY'RETHE ONLY TWO FULLY HUMAN --
>> Jon: OH THAT'S INTERESTING.THAT'S INTERESTING.
>> THEY'RE THE ONLYTWO FULLY HUMAN SUPERHEROES.
>> Jon:  RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> AND SO IT'S THE UTILITY BELTVERSUS THE INGENUITY.
>> Jon: I'VE GOTTA -- I'VE GOTTAGIVE THE EDGE TO IRON MAN.
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.
I'M IRON MAN.
IT'S IRON MAN.
>> Jon:  CAN I TELL YOUSOMETHING?
HERE'S THE PROBLEM BATMAN HAS.
YOU CANNOT BE A GUY IN A LEOTARDAND NOT -- AND JUST BE HUMAN.
LIKE SUPERMAN CAN GET AWAY WITHIT CAUSE HE'S SUPERMAN.
>> AND THESE ARE BLUE LEOTARDS,YEAH, PANTYHOSE,
WHATEVER HE'S WEARING --( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. BUT IRONMAN I THINK FIGURED SOMETHING
OUT, WHICH IS THAT I SHOULD WEARIRON AND NOT A LEOTARD.
( LAUGHTER )>> THAT'S RIGHT -- BASIC FACTS.
>> WHEN IS "STAR TALK" ON?
>> OH, THANKS.
IT'S-- IT JUMPED SPECIES TOTELEVISION.
>> Jon:  IT DID.
IT WAS ON THE RADIO. IT WAS ARADIO SHOW.
>> AND DID YOU KNOW, HE WAS ONAN ORIGINAL EPISODE OF
"STAR TALK."
>> Jon: THE ORIGINAL "STARTALK."
>> AND I FOUND OUT, THAT'SWHEN I FOUND OUT HE MAJORED
IN CHEMISTRY IN COLLEGE AND THENI ASKED THE GEEK QUESTION
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE ELEMENT?
AND HE SAYS I HAVE A FAVORITEELEMENT.
I HAD A POST OR MY WALL.
IT'S CARBON.>> Jon: BOOM.
>> AND I SAID WHY IS IT CARBON,AND HE SAID, BECAUSE HE KNEW
THAT CARBON COMBINES WITH ALLOTHER ELEMENTS ON THE TABLE.
AND HE SAID CARBON IS LIKE THESLUT OF THE PERIODIC TABLE OF
ELEMENTS. THAT'S IT!
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: BONDED WITH EVERYBODY.
CARBON IS ALWAYS LIKE-- OH,SNAP.
WHAT IS THAT, OXYGEN?
GIVE ME TWO OF THOSE BAD BOYS.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT!THAT'S RIGHT, I MEAN CO2 --
>> Jon: OH --HYDROGEN.
>> YEAH, GIVE ME FOUR OF THOSE.
CH-4.
YEAH.
>> Jon:  I'M GOING TO ESTER THAT( BLEEP ).
>> SO, SO "STAR TALK" IS ABOUTGETTING PEOPLE --
>> Jon: YEAH. YEAH.
>> HEWN FROM POPCULTURE SUCH AS YOURSELF --
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND EXPLORING ALL THEWAYS SCIENCE HAS MATTERED IN
THEIR LIVES.
SO IT REVEALS THE FACT THATSCIENCE MANIFESTS EVEN IN OUR
CHERISHED POP CULTUREINSTITUTIONS.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT ILOVE ABOUT THAT?
THAT TO ME IS THE SLOGAN FORYOU. "SCIENCE MATTERS."
I LIKE THAT.
