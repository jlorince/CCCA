>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HERE WE GO THEN.
THE WORLD IS STILL REELING FROMTHE MYSTERIOUS MISSILE ATTACK
OVER EASTERN UKRAINE, WHICH LASTWEEK TOOK DOWN A CIVILIAN
MALAYSIA AIRLINES JET. THERE'S ALOT OF CONFUSION.
A LOT OF FINGER POINTING.WHAT DOES THE EVIDENCE SAY?
>> THREE SA-11 MISSILE BATTERIES
RECENTLY ENTERED UKRAINE FROMRUSSIA.
>> A MISSILE LAUNCH FROM AREBEL-HELD AREA WAS DETECTED BY
U.S. INTELLIGENCE.
>> REBEL LEADERS TALKING ABOUTHIDING THOSE BLACK BOXES ON
INSTRUCTIONS FROM MOSCOW.
>> Jon: SOURCES SAY FRAGMENTSOF THE MISSILE REEKED OF BORSCHT
AND REPORTS INDICATE THAT WITHINTHAT MISSILE THERE WERE SEVERAL
SUCCESSIVELY SMALLER NESTINGMISSILES.
[LAUGHTER]SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF EVIDENCE,
BUT IT'S ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
ARE YOU GOING TO CONVICT ONCIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE?
>> ONE OF THE PRO-RUSSIANMILITANT LEADERS TWEETED PROUDLY
AT THE TIME THAT THIS PLANE WASFIRST SHOT DOWN THAT HIS FORCES
HAD TAKEN DOWN A UKRAINIANMILITARY TRANSPORT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: OKAY.
THAT'S A LITTLE STRONGER.
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND ACONFESSION POINT TO THE RUSSIAN
REBELS BEING SUPPLIED WITHTECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW
BY MOSCOW. PERHAPS THERE ISANOTHER EQUALLY PLAUSIBLE ANGLE
THE WEST HAD NOT CONSIDERED.
ONE THAT'S GETTING MAINSTREAMAIRPLAY IN RUSSIA.
>> THEY SAY, "INSIDE WE'RE NOTLIVE PEOPLE BUT CORPSES.
THE PLANE WAS FLOWN NOT BY REALPILOTS.
IT WAS ON AUTOPILOT.
IN THE NECESSARY SPOT IT WASBLOWN UP WITHOUT EVEN USING A
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE."
[AUDIENCE REACTS].
>> Jon: SO EITHER POORLYTRAINED RUSSIAN INSURGENTS
UTILIZING HIGH-LEVEL MILITARYTECH FROM RUSSIA MISTAKENLY BLEW
UP A PASSENGER PLANE.
OR... PERHAPS EQUALLY LIKELY,THE DUTCH, THE WORLD'S FLORISTS,
LOADED CORPSES ONTO A PLANE INAMSTERDAM AND DITCHED IT
DIRECTLY OVER THEREBEL-CONTROLLED AREA OF EASTERN
UKRAINE TO MAKE THEM LOOK BADFOR NO [BLEEPED] REASON
WHATSOEVER.[LAUGHTER]
THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE US THEWINDMILL, THE POT BROWNIE AND A
BED SHEET OVEN POWERED BYFARTS NOW GIVES US THE
UNPROVOKED FLYING ZOMBIE PLANE.
THAT IS SO LIKE THE DUTCH.
EVEN WIKIPEDIA HAS PRONOUNCEDTHE RUSSIAN REBELS GUILTY.
>> AN INTERNET USER WITHIN THERUSSIAN GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY
REVISED A WIKIPEDIA ENTRY ABOUTMALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 17.
THE ORIGINAL ENTRY SAID THEPLANE WAS SHOT DOWN BY
TERRORISTS OF THESELF-PROCLAIMED DONETSK PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC.
THE REVISED ENTRY WRITTEN LESSTHAN AN HOUR AFTER THE ORIGINAL
SAID THE PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN BYUKRAINIAN SOLDIERS.
>> Jon: GOD THE RUSSIANS AREGOOD. THE SAME WIKIPEDIA USER
WENT ON TO NOTE THAT EVEN IFRUSSIAN REBELS HAD SHOT,
TECHNICALLY GREEDO SHOT FIRST.[LAUGHTER]
REALLY. GOT A FEW "STAR WARS"NERDS OVER
TO THE RIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]EVERYONE ELSE... SO DESPITE ALL
THE EVIDENCE, PUTIN SAYS ITWASN'T HIM. IT'S WHAT WE IN THE
JEW POLITICAL LITIGATIONBUSINESS KNOW AS "THE SHAGGY
DEFENSE."
♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪>> BUT WE SAW YOU MOVE THE
MISSILES. ♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪
>> Jon: BUT WE HEARD YOU TALKINGABOUT IT WITH THE REBELS.
♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪
>> Jon: WE SAW YOU KISSING ONTHE SOFA
♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
YOU WIN THIS ROUND.
PUTIN, DID THE LIPS MATCH THESONG?
I COULDN'T SEE IT.
YES!
[LAUGHTER]I ONLY...ALL RIGHT.
CLEARLY THE STAKES ARE HIGH.
WHOEVER SHOULDERS THE BLAME FORTHIS ATROCITY IS GOING TO BE THE
TARGET OF GLOBAL ANGER.
AND RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'SRUSSIA'S FAULT BECAUSE IT'S
RUSSIA'S FAULT.
OF COURSE, THAT DOESN'T MEANRUSSIA'S GOING TO ADMIT IT.
>> YOU BLAME RUSSIA FOR THERECENT CURRENT EVENTS?
WE CALL YOUR PRESIDENT A WUSSUNLIKE OUR TRUE LEADER, VLADIMIR
PUTIN.
>> Jon: YOU SHUT UP, LANA.
I AM SO SICK OF HER AND RUSEVTRASH TALKING AMERICA.
AND SURE, MAYBE THEY BEAT JACKSWAGGER LAST NIGHT, BUT THAT WAS
A COUNT-OUT, IT WASN'T EVENA REAL PIN. AND SWAGGER'S BEEN
OFF HIS GAME ANYWAY. EVER SINCETAG-TEAM PARTNER ANTONIO CESARO
TURNED ON HIM AND ABANDONED THEREAL AMERICANS TO GO SOLO AS THE
THE KING OF SWING, BUTCESARO WAIT UNTIL SUMMER SLAM
BECAUSE JACK IS --[LAUGHTER]
WRONG ROOM? [CLEARS THROAT]
WELL, WATCH OUT, PUTIN, BECAUSEAMERICA HAS
SOMETHING THAT NO PROPAGANDA CANDEFEAT, THE MORAL HIGH GROUND.
>> ONE RUSSIAN DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTER EVEN SNIPED AT THE U.S.
ON TWITTER, "THE WHITE HOUSE HASFOUND GUILT BEFORE ANY
INVESTIGATION, JUST LIKE SADDAMHUSSEIN AND HIS WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION."
[AUDIENCE REACTS].
>> Jon: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVEMARK.
YOU INVADE ONE COUNTRY UNDER APRETEXT THAT YOU LEARN ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY WAS FALSE AND THENQUIETLY CHANGE THAT PRETEXT AND
PRETEND LIKE YOU NEVERMADE THE MISTAKE IN THE
FIRST PLACE AND THEY NEVER LETYOU FORGET IT.
[LAUGHTER]YOU KNOW WHAT FINE, WE DON'T
NEED YOU, RUSSIA, OR HOWDANGEROUS YOU MAKE UKRAINIAN
AIR SPACE. THERE ARE OTHER WAYSTO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO.
>> THE AIRLINE REROUTED A FLIGHTFROM KUALA LUMPUR TO LONDON.
IT COULD NOT USE THE USUAL ROUTEOVER UKRAINE FOLLOWING THE
DOWNING OF FLIGHT 17.
SO THE AIRLINE REROUTED THEFLIGHT OVER SYRIA, THAT IS,
AS YOU KNOW, ANOTHER WAR ZONE.
[AUDIENCE REACTING].
>> Jon: YEP.
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW INTHE WORLD.
WHEN THE AREA ABOVE AN ONGOINGCIVIL WAR THAT'S KILLED TENS OF
THOUSANDS AND INVOLVED THE USEOF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS KNOWN AS
"THE COMMUTER LANE."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
