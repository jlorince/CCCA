[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR.
NEW FILM IS "THE IMITATIONGAME."
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?
>> PLAY?
>> IT'S A GAME.
A TEST OF SORTS.
TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMETHINGIS A MACHINE OR A HUMAN BEING.
>> HOW DO I PLAY?
>> WELL THERE'S A JUDGEAND A SUBJECT.
THE JUDGE ASKS QUESTIONS, ANDDEPENDING ON THE SUBJECT'S
ANSWERS DETERMINES WHO HE ISTALKING WITH OR WHAT HE IS
TALKING WITH.
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK MEA QUESTION.
>> Jon: IT'S AN AWESOME MOVIE.
PLEASE WELCOME BENEDICTCUMBERBATCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A
QUESTION.>> HELLO.
>> Jon: YOU GET A LOT OF THAT,DON'T YOU?
>> WHAT THE LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCEATMOSPHERE WITH THE --
>> Jon: THE SHREAKING, THEJUMPING, THE CLAPPING.
>> UH, UH -- YEAH.
YEAH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
>> IT DOESN'T EVER NORMALIZE, ITELL YOU THAT.
IT'S WONDERFUL BUT VERY STRANGE.
>> Jon: BUT THERE REALLY IS,THERE'S SOMETHING.
I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. IHAVE A LOST GUESTS ON THE SHOW.
I HAVE A LOT OF HIGH PROFILE, WEHAVE PRESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES,
SITTING HEADS OF STATE.>> YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO.
>> Jon:  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU'RE THE FIRST GUEST, I WANTTO RIP YOUR CLOTHES AND SELL
THEM ON E-BAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
IT'S UPSETTING FOR ME.
>> MAYBE WE CAN COME TO ANARRANGEMENT.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT WOULD BE --I FEEL LIKE IF YOU WERE TO GO ON
THE INTERNET ANDOIL UP YOUR BACKSIDE AND
BARED IT IN A KARDASHIAN LIKEPOSE THIS PLANET
COULD END.
[LAUGHING] THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
>> SATELLITES WILL CRASH.
>> Jon: SATELLITES WILL CRASHINTO THE THING.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
THIS PERFORMANCE IS REMARKABLE.
AND WE SAW A LITTLE SOMETHING INTHE CLIP I WANT TO POINT OUT.
SO ALAN TURING, WHO IS THESCIENTIST, WELL EXPLAIN QUICKLY
WHAT IT IS AND THEN I WILL GETTO THE POINT, THE FILM.
>> THE FILM, THE FILM IS CALLED"THE IMITATION GAME" IT'S ABOUT
ALAN TURING AND THE TEAM OFSCIENTISTS WHO CRACK THE
GERMAN ENIGMA CODE, WHICHPOSSIBLY BROUGHT ABOUT A 2-YEAR
EARLY END TO THE SECOND WORLDWAR THEREBY SAVING 14 MILLION
LIVES. AND YOU'RE SORT OF,YOU'RE INTRODUCED TO THIS
CHARACTER AND HE'SVERY DIFFERENT, DIFFICULT,
UNCOMPROMISING.>> Jon: YES. YES.
>> THERE'S NO VANITY ABOUT HIM.HE'S FUNNY, BOTH INTENTIONALLY,
AND UNINTENTIONALLY.AND SLOWLY, AS THE MYSTERY
GETS CRACKED YOU ALSO CRACKTHE CODE OF WHO THIS MAN IS.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.>> YOU SEE BACK INTO HIS PAST
AND UNDERSTAND HIM.
>> Jon: HE COULD OF SAVED14 MILLION LIVES.
AND THEY REPAY HIM AFTER THE WARWITH --
>> STATE SANCTION AND CHEMICALCASTRATION.
>> Jon: STATE SANCTION ANDCHEMICAL CASTRATION.
YES, THT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE ITTURNS OUT HE WAS GAY.
AND THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.
AND IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE.
REMARKABLE STORY.
>> YES. AND COMPLETELY TRUESTORY.
AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE MAINREASONS I WANTED TO TELL IT WAS
BECAUSE OF HOW ANGRY I WASNOT JUST AT THE INJUSTICE HE WAS
SERVED BUT HOW RELATIVE TO THESCALE OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS.
THIS MAN -- AND NOT ONLY INOUR FILM DOES HE HELP THE EFFORT
THAT WON US THE WAR.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THAT MARKS ME, OR MARKSHIM RATHER AS A WAR HERO FOR ME.
AND BEFORE THAT HE WAS BASICALLYTHE FATHER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE.
THE MODERN COMPUTER SCIENCE.
>> Jon: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUTTHE CLIP, THE TURING TEST
WHERE YOU DECIDE WHETHERSOMETHING IS HUMAN OR WHETHER
SOMETHING IS A MACHINE.
>> CORRECT.
WELL THAT WAS WORK HE DID AFTERTHE WAR.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT WAS WORK HE DID ONARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
SO THE IMITATION GAME IS ANOTHERPHRASE FOR THE TURING TEST
WHICH HE SORT OF WENT INTO THISINCREDIBLE PHILOSOPHICAL
QUESTION THAT STILL HAUNTS USOUTSIDE OF THE SCIENCES.
>> Jon: AND WE STILL CAN'T CRACKIT. WE STILL CAN'T CRACK.
>> WELL NO, IT'S ONE OF THEBIGGEST UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES US HUMAN?
WHAT IS IT IN OUR INTELLIGENCETHAT IS OURS AND OURS ALONE.
>> IF YOU FABRICATE SOMETHINGTHAT REPLICATES THAT,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING ISMADE DIFFERENTLY DOESN'T MEAN
AND THINKING DIFFERENTLY DOESN'TMEAN IT'S NOT THINKING, SO --
>> Jon: RIGHT. I GUESS IT WOULDBE THE WRONG TIME TO ASK YOU TO
MARRY ME.
[LAUGHING]>> YOU'RE A BIT LATE.
Jon: CAUSE JUST AS YOU WERETALKING I WAS LIKE
MAN, HE'S REALLY SMART TOO.
NOW THIS WHOLE THING ISSTARTING TO GET UPSETTING.
BUT IN THE FILM -- HERE IS WHATI WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
AND THIS IS, IT'S , IT'S GONNASEEM LIKE SMALL BALL.
BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THEPREPARATION YOU PUT IN AND THE
TYPE OF PERFORMANCE THAT THISIS.
SO ALAN TURING HAD A BIT OF ASTUTTER.
AND WHEN YOU WATCH SOMEONEPERFORM IN A FILM, AN ACTOR DO A
STUTTER, IT'S ALWAYS ON ACONSONANT.
YOU DO SOMETHING IN THEFILM THAT IS UTTERLY, IT'S NOT
THAT.
IT'S ON THE VOWEL OR YOU FIND AWAY TO DO IT WHERE IT, AND IT
BRINGS AN AUTHENTICITY TO IT.
AND IS THAT FROM HIS SPEECHPATTERN OR SOMETHING YOU WERE
ABLE TO KIND OF CONJURE?
>> WELL, THERE IS NO AUDIORECORDING OF HIM.
THERE IS NO VIDEO FOOTAGE OFHIM.
BUT THERE IS EXTENSIVE ANECDOTALDESCRIPTION OF HOW HE DID
STAMMER AND IT WAS PRETTYMAJOR.
IN THE FILM IT GETS WORSE WHENHE'S UNDER PRESSURE.
WHEN THERE'S EITHER AN EMOTIONALOR PHYSICAL PRESSURE ON HIM TO
STOP THE WORK AT BLETCHLEY PARK,WHICH PEOPLE TRIED TO SHUT
DOWN AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THEFILM.
WHEN HE'S UNDER PRESSURE NEARTHE END OF THE FILM WHEN HE'S
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANIC ATTACKBASICALLY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS
OF THE ESTROGEN INJECTIONS.BUT IN LIFE IT WAS ALMOST
A SENTENCE BY SENTENCEOCCURRENCE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNTOF ARTISTIC LICENSE WITH
CONDENSING THAT TO THE MOMENTSWE DO USE IT IN THE FILM --
>> Jon: AND YOU WERE ABLE TO DOIT WITHOUT NECESSARILY GIVING
AWAY CHEATS OR PATTERNING.AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S SORT
OF REMARKABLE ABOUT THEPERFORMANCE.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
>> I GUESS YOU SORT OF EMBODY ITAND YOU PLAY IT THROUGH.
IT'S REALLY, IT'S QUITE LOVELY.
I WISH YOU WERE AT LEAST LESSTALENTED.
I WISH YOU WOULD JUST LEAN OVERAND BE LIKE "I HAVE EIGHT
NIPPLES" LIKE SOMETHING TO HELPME GET OVER THIS CAT.
"THE IMITATION GAME" BY THE WAY,IN THEATERS NOVEMBER 28th.
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE A GREATTHING, IS MAYBE TAKE IN A
DOUBLE FEATURE WITH ANOTHER FILMTHAT'S ALSO MAYBE PLAYING --
>> ROSEWATER.
>> Jon: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH.
