>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT LEGENDARY GUITARIST PETE TOWNSEND WILL BE JOINING US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ONE OF MY ALL-TIME HEROES.
QUICK STORY FALLOUT FROM THE RUMBLE ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY OTHER THAN FOR PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T DOWNLOAD IT, I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
IT TURNS OUT THE INTERNET IS A SERIES OF TUBES.
IF YOU STUFF TOO MUCH IN ONE TUBE, IT WON'T... BUT IT TURNS OUT MY KIDS WATCHED AND APPARENTLY THE PHRASE "BULL
[BLEEP] MOUNTAIN" WAS AWFULLY POPULAR WITH MY SON WHO IS EIGHT YEARS OLD.
APPARENTLY NOT AS POPULAR WITH MY WIFE.
IN TERMS OF HIM USING IT.
SO, I DROVE HOME THE NEXT DAY FROM WASHINGTON.
I GOT TO THE HOUSE.
I GREETED EVERYBODY.
I WAS SO EXCITED TO BE HOME.
I NOTICED MY SON WAS SITTING ACROSS THE ROOM GIVING ME THE STINK EYE.
GIVING ME ONE OF THESE.
AND SO I GO, HEY, NATE, WHAT'S UP, MAN?
HE GOES, "YOU SHOULD WATCH WHAT YOU SAY." I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" HE GOES, "KIDS COULD SEE THAT
AND USE THAT LANGUAGE AND THEY COULD GET IN REAL TROUBLE." THERE YOU HAVE IT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE [BLEEP] I'M OUT
