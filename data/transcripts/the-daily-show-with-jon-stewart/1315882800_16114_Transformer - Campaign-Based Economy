SO THE PRESIDENT WAS ON A
ROLL.
OF COURSE WE'VE BECOME
ACCUSTOMED TO OBAMA
ACQUIESCING TO REPUBLICAN
LEGISLATIVE INTRANSYENTS.
WHAT'S HIS STRATEGY.
>> YOU SHOULD PASS THIS JOBS
PLAN RIGHT AWAY.
PASS THIS JOBS BILL AND WE CAN
PUT PEOPLE TO WORK REBUILDING
AMERICA.
PASS THIS BILL.
PASS THIS JOBS BILL.
PASS THIS BILL RIGHT AWAY.
PASS THIS JOBS BILL.
PASS THIS BILL.
PASS THIS BILL RIGHT AWAY.
>> Jon: YOU CAN REPEAT IT ALL
YOU WANT.
IT'S NOT REALLY....
>> PASS THIS JOBS BILL.
>> Jon: IN THIS POLITICAL
CLIMATE....
>> PASS THIS JOBS BILL.
>> Jon: TOUCHE.
THAT WAS THURSDAY NIGHT.
THE NEXT DAY, OBAMA HEADS OUT
TO SELL THE BILL WITH A HUGE
RALLY-- AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A NICE TOUCH-- ERIC CANTOR'S
HOME DISTRICT.
THIS MORNING HE DOES THE WHOLE
ROSE GARDEN CEREMONY WITH A
HUNDRED OF HIS CLOSEST PROPS.
>> STAND ING WITH ME THIS
MORNING ARE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
WILL BE HELPED BY THE AMERICAN
JOBS ACT.
I'M STANDING WITH TEACHERS.
I'M STANDING HERE WITH
VETERANS, WITH COPS AND
FIREFIGHTERS, SMALL BUSINESS
OWNERS, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.
>> Jon: WOW.
IT'S LIKE HE'S WITH THE
VILLAGE PEOPLE.
IT'S LIKE HE IS WITH THE
VILLAGE PEOPLE OF A DOUBLE-DIP
RECESSION.
WE HAVE TO LIVE AT THE Y-M-C-A.
LOOK, I'VE GOT TO SAY...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOOK AT THE FIRE.
LOOK AT THE FIRE IN OBAMA'S
BELLY.
LOOK AT IT.
>> NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR
PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON TO BE
WORRYING ABOUT THEIR JOBS.
IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO BE
WORRYING ABOUT YOUR JOBS.
NOW IS THE TIME TO PUT
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK.
NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT.
>> Jon: I REMEMBER THAT GUY.
IT'S SO REFRESHING, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
CAMPAIGN OBAMA IS BACK.
SO MUCH COOLER THAN GOVERNING
OBAMA.
I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN CAMPAIGN
OBAMA EXISTED AFTER
TWO-AND-A-HALF YEARS OF
WATCHING THIS OTHER GUY.
>> WHAT YOU SAW... AND AGAIN,
YOU KNOW, YOU'LL SEE THIS FROM
THE DESCRIPTION OF... OF... OF
THE DEAL.
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY HAD
AGREED TO GIVE ON IS... IS
TO... TO GET BACK TO... UH, A
BASELINE.
THIS STARTS GETTING TECHNICAL.
BUT THERE WERE ABOUT 800
BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE.
WHAT WE SAID WAS WHEN YOU HAVE
A RATIO OF $4 IN CUTS FOR
EVERYONE DOLLAR OF REVENUE
THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO STOMACH.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHY I FOLDED ON
THE DEFICIT REDUCTION DEAL.
ANYWAY, SEE THE OTHER GUY
WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE THAT.
BECOMING CAMPAIGN OBAMA HAS
REINVIGORATED OBAMA.
RAISING MONEY.
ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES.
YOUR OPPONENTS ARE RAISING
MONEY ON THEIR OWN AND ROLLING
UP THEIR SLEEVES?
WAIT.
I THINK I MAY HAVE AN IDEA
THAT MAY SOLVE ALL OF OUR
PROBLEMS.
FOREVER.
NO, IT'S NOT HELP FOR PANDAS.
LET US AS A NATION GIVE UP THE
PIPE DREAM ONCE AND FOR ALL
THAT AN INSPIRATIONAL LEADER
CAN CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO,
REMAKE WASHINGTON AND GOVERN
SUCCESSFULLY.
BUT WE CAN PLAY TO OUR
STRENGTHS AND EMBRACE AN
AMERICA WHOSE GREATEST
RESOURCE IS CAMPAIGN-DRIVEN
DRIBBLE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN ASPIRING
POLITICAL LEADERS TELLING US
HOW GREAT WE ARE.
LET'S USE THAT AND CONVERT
AMERICA TO A CAMPAIGN-BASED
ECONOMY.
THE COMMERCIALS, THE BUS TOURS,
THE FUND RAISING.
THINK OF HOW MANY TEACHERS,
FIRST RESPONDERS AND
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WE COULD
HIRE IF WE NEED THEM TO STAND
BEHIND POLITICIANS EIGHT HOURS
A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND PUMP MORE MONEY IN A LOCAL
ECONOMY THAN A POLITICAL
CONVENTION.
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
COULD HOLD ONE MONTHLY IN
EVERY STATE INJECTING BILLIONS
INTO THE BALLOON DROP STRAW
HAT ESCORT AND DEAD ESCORT
REMOVAL INDUSTRIES.
CAN WE SAVE THIS COUNTRY BY
RELYING ON OUR GREATEST
NATURAL RESOURCE: HAND-CRANKED
CORPORATELY FINANCED BULL
(BEEP) MACHINES?
I SAY YES, WE CAN!
