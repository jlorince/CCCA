(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, CHRISTINELAGARDE.
CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGINGDIRECTOR OF THE IMF
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.
SHE WILL BE HERE TO PROMOTEMONEY LATER ON.
A LOT OF SURPRISING RESULTSFROM LAST NIGHT, I'M SURE YOU
GUYS SAW, I DON'T THINK ANYBODYEXPECTED RUSEV TO RETAIN
AND UH -- OH, ANDTHE OSCARS TOO.
SORRY, I WAS THINKING OFSOMETHING ELSE.
HOW ABOUT COMMON AND JOHNLEGEND, THOUGH? COME ON.
THOSE GUYS.(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
THEY WERE, THAT WAS ONE OFTHE BEST MOMENTS ON TV I'VE
EVER SEEN.
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODYKNOWS ISIS THERE ARE HORRIBLE,
BARBARIC APOCALYPTIC DEATHCULT FULL OF THIRSTY
BLOOD THIRSTY MONSTERS. IT'S,IT'S --
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE ITIS ON ALL OF THEIR ADVERTISING.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S WHY OUR GOVERNMENT IS
PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS TOWIPE THEM OUT.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ISCONVENING WHAT IS BEING
CALLED A SUMMIT ONCOUNTERING VIOLENT
EXTREMISM, WAYS TO TRY TO DEFEATTHE TERRORISTS THAT GO BEYOND
MILITARY ACTIONS.
>> Jon: OH [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER) YOU DONE POKED A SLEEPING
BEAR, ISIS.
AND NOW THE BEAR IS HAVING ASUMMIT!
(LAUGHTER)CAUSE EVEN THOUGH THIS BEAR IS
A PERFECT KILLING MACHINE,IT WOULD PREFER IF JUST ONE
TIME OTHER LARGE MAMMALS HADAN IDEA.
BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING OUTOF SALMON WHILE THE PANDAS
JUST GET FAT [BLEEP] HAPPYROLLING AROUND IN THE SNOW,
BUYING UP ALL OF OUR DEBT.
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, WE'RETRYING TO THINK OF IDEAS TO
GET ISIS'S PICNIC BASKET.BUT IN SPITE OF AMERICA'S
DECISIVE BUREAUCRATIC ACTION,SOME NAYSAYERS STILL HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT BONE TO PICK WITHTHE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY.
>> WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS NOTGOING TO CALL THEM
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS OR MUSLIMRADICALS OR ANY OF THAT STUFF.
>> THE FRENCH LEADERSHIP DON'TSEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH CALLING RADICAL ISLAMISTSRADICAL ISLAMISTS.
>> THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAMICTERRORISM DO NOT COME OUT OF
THE PRESIDENT'S MOUTH.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
ANOTHER WORD THAT DOES NOTCOME OUT OF HIS MOUTH IS
MOIST.
(LAUGHTER)NOT, NOT FOR POLITICAL
REASONS, THE PRESIDENT JUSTDOESN'T LIKE THE WAY IT
SOUNDS.
HE THINK IT'S GROSS.
MOIST.
BUT TED CRUZ IS LYING RIGHT? IMEAN THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.
SOMEONE IN THEADMINISTRATION HAS GOT TO BE
USING THE WORD ISLAMIC.
>> SENIOR ADMINISTRATIONOFFICIALS WERE ASKED WHY
THEY AVOID THE TERM ISLAMICEXTREMISM AND IN THE WORDS
OF ONE OFFICIAL, THISOFFICIAL SAID WE'LL CALL
THEM TERRORISTS, YOU CAN CALLTHEM WHAT YOU WANT.
>> SERIOUSLY, WHATEVER WEWANT?
(LAUGHTER)LIKE BALL GARGLING TAINT
CLOWNS? CAN WE --
GRUMPY, LUMPY, NO DICKWUMPIES?
BUTT-FACED FACE-BUTTS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, PRESIDENTOBAMA WOULDN'T BE MINCING
WORDS IF HE UNDERSTOOD THEREAL SITUATION.
>> MY GOD, ISIS IS TAKINGOVER THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> THE HOLY WAR IS HERE.
>> THE REALITY IS WE HAVEPEOPLE TRYING TO KILL US.
>> THEY'RE NOT A JV TEAM.
THEY'RE NOT ON THE RUN ANDWE'RE NOT WINNING.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING TO
THE PRESIDENT HERE, NOT THEREFEREE AT YOUR KID'S
MIGHTY MIGHT FOOTBALLGAME. AND CODY WAS NOT
OFFSIDES.
LOOK, WE DO NEED ASTRAIGHT ANSWER ON THIS
WHOLE NO SAY-ISLAM THING,MR. PRESIDENT.
PLEASE EXPLAIN.
>> I WANTS TO BE VERY CLEARABOUT HOW I SEE IT.
AL QAEDA AND ISIL AND GROUPSLIKE IT ARE DESPERATE FOR
LEGITIMACY.
THEY PROPAGATE THE NOTIONTHAT AMERICA AND THE WEST
GENERALLY, IS AT WAR WITHISLAM.
WE MUST NEVER ACCEPT THEPREMISE THAT THEY PUT
FORWARD.
BECAUSE IT IS A LIE.
NOR SHOULD WE GRANT THESETERRORISTS THE RELIGIOUS
LEGITIMACY THAT THEY SEEK.
THEY ARE NOT RELIGIOUSLEADERS, THEY'RE TERRORISTS.
>> Jon: OH GOD, SIX YEARS INTOHIS PRESIDENCY, SIX AND A HALF
YEARS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, ANDTHIS MAN STILL THINKS THAT
HE CAN PERSUADE US THROUGHREASONED ARGUMENT. I MEAN,
(LAUGHTER)HAVE YOU MET US?
OH, YOU HAVE A RATIONALE.
I WITHDRAW MY FREAK OUT.
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE AVERY CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO
AVOID THE WORD ISLAMASSURING CRITICS THAT THIS
IS A DELIBERATE CHOICEDESIGNED TO DENY ISIS ANY
FURTHER PROPAGANDA FUEL.
IT'S THE TYPE OF RESTRAINEDSTRATEGY THAT IS SOMEWHAT UNDONE
EVERY TIME ONE OF OUR SKY-BASEDKILLING ROBOTS MISTAKES A
WEDDING FOR A TERRORTRAINING CAMP.
ANYWAY, BUT THAT'S ALWAYSBEEN OBAMA'S PROBLEM.
OBAMA THINKS THAT IF HE JUSTSITS DOWN AND EXPLAINS
THINGS TO US IN A CALM,REASONED, SLIGHTLY ANNOYED
TONE, EVERYONE WILL GET IT.IT'S WHAT THE MEDICAL
COMMUNITY CALLEDMSNBC-ITIS.
IT'S A CONDITION WHERE ONE USESFACTS AND RESEARCH TO REFUTE
OPPONENTS DELIVERED WHILSTBESPECTACLED IN A TONE
SUGGESTING, YOU CAN'TBELIEVE YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THIS TO THESE [BLEEP] IDIOTSAGAIN.
SYMPTOMS INCLUDECANCELLATION.
MR. PRESIDENT, THAT KIND OFARGUMENT IS NOT GOING TO
REACH YOUR OPPONENTS.
THEY ONLY RESPOND TOEMOTION.
IT'S A TOTAL COMMUNICATIONBREAKDOWN.
HERE IS HOW YOU KNOW, LISTENTO THE PRESIDENT'S CRITIC
PLAN FOR WHAT THE PRESIDENTSHOULD BE DOING TO FIGHT
ISIS AND THEN LISTEN TO WHATWE ARE DOING TO FIGHT ISIS.
>> COULD WE INCREASE AIRSTRIKES AND POUND ISIS EVEN
MORE?
>> THE U.S.-LED COALITIONHAS LAUNCHED ALMOST 2500 AIR
STRIKES AGAINST ISIS.
>> WE NEED TO DO IT BYBUILDING UP A BIG COALITION
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> AMERICA WILL LEAD A BROADCOALITION.
>> WE NEED TO COMPLETELYANNIHILATE ISIS.
>> WE WILL DEGRADE ANDULTIMATELY DESTROY ISIL.
>> FOR HIM TO DOWNPLAY THISTHREAT.
>> ISIL IS A THREAT NOT ONLYTO IRAQ, BUT ALSO THE REGION,
AND ULTIMATELY OVER THELONG-TERM COULD BE A THREAT
TO THE UNITED STATES.
>> Jon: IT'S LIKE THOSEPEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT
OBAMA, IT'S LIKE THATCOMPLAIN ABOUT A TV SHOW
BUT HAVE NEVEN SEEN THE TVSHOW.
LIKE, LIKE "NEW GIRL," IT'SACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.
I KNOW THE WHOLE ADORKABLETHING WAS OFF PUTTING BUT
SCHMIDT'S HILARIOUS, WINSTON,AND CECE.
I MEAN, COME ON, FUNNY ANDBEAUTIFUL. RIGHT, RIGHT NOW
ZOOEY IS JUST, SHE'S JUSTTHE COCK HOLDING THIS CRAZY --
I'VE BEEN CATCHING UP ON HULU --
YOU SEE UNFORTUNATELY NO MATTERWHAT
THE PRESIDENT OUTLINES, THISIS THE STRATEGY HIS
OPPONENTS ARE LOOKING FOR.
>> HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITHISIS?
>> I WOULD GO VERY, VERYHARD AND VERY, VERY STRONG.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HARD AND STRONG.
[BLEEP] NO DETAILS, NOSTRATEGY.
JUST MILITARY PORN TALK.
THE PRESIDENT'S GOT TO GO
BALLS DEEP INTO ISIS, INEVERY ORIFICE POSSIBLE, ALL
NIGHT LONG UNTIL IT SCREAMSWITH SURRENDER LIKE MOST
THINGS THAT HAVE SPENT ANIGHT WITH ME, IT WILL WISH
IT HAD NEVER BEEN [BLEEP]BORN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO BOTH SIDES
FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE ON THENEED TO BLOW UP A LOT OF BAD
GUYS.
THIS IS REALLY JUST ADISAGREEMENT ABOUT TONE.
ISN'T THERE SOME WAY WE CANBRIDGE THAT GAP?
HAVE OBAMA KEEP THIS BUTALSO USE THIS AND A LITTLE
OF THIS.
OF COURSE IT WOULD HELP TOHAVE SOME SORT OF PRODUCTION
DEPARTMENT SCHOOLED IN EDITINGAND GRAPHICS BUT WHO EVEN HAS
THAT KIND OF ACCESS TO -- ROLLTHE SOLUTION.
>> I WANT TO BE VERY CLEARABOUT HOW I SEE IT.
AL QAEDA AND ISIL AND GROUPSLIKE IT ARE DESPERATE FOR
LEGITIMACY.
THEY PROPAGATE THE NOTIONTHAT AMERICA AND THE WEST
GENERALLY, IS AT WAR WITHISLAM.
WE MUST NEVER ACCEPT THEPREMISE THAT THEY PUT
FORWARD. BECAUSE IT IS A LIE.
NOR SHOULD WE GRANT THESETERRORISTS THE RELIGIOUS
LEGITIMACY THAT THEY SEEKTHEY ARE NOT RELIGIOUS
LEADERS.
THEY'RE TERRORISTS.
>> Jon: WHOOO! WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK.
