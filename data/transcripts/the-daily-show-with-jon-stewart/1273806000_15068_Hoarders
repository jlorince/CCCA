YOU REMEMBER, THINK BACK,
YOU REMEMBER A LITTLE MORE
THAN A YEAR AGO WE GAVE BANK
OF AMERICA, CITIGROUP, JP
MORE BEGAN CHASE AND GOLDMAN
SACHS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10
AND $25 BILLION DOLLARS A
PIECE TO STAVE OFF A
CATASTROPHIC IMPLOSION OF
THEIR BONUS SYSTEM-- I
MEAN--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE ECONOMY.
WHICH APPARENTLY DEPENDS ON
THEM.
WELL, GOOD NEWS.
ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMY
REMAININGS VOLATILE AS
EVIDENCED BY LAST WEEK'S 20
MINUTE THOUSAND POINT STILL
HAUNTINGLY UNEXPLAINED STOCK
MARKET DROP, ONE SECTOR OF
THE ECONOMY APPEARS TO HAVE
STABILIZED.
>> BANK OF AMERICA, GOLDMAN
SACHS, CITIGROUP AND
JPMORGAN HAVE JUST PITCHED A
WALL STREET EQUIVALENT OF A
PERFECT GAME TO THE BIG
BANKS MADE MONEY EVERY
SINGLE DAY LAST QUARTER.
0 DAYS OF LOSSES.
NO DAYS IN THE RED, EVERY
DAY IN THE BLACK.
>> Jon: YEAH, PITCHED BY
FOUR STRAIGHT TEAMS.
ON 61 CONSECUTIVE DAYS.
THE RULES ARE SET UP TO MAKE
IT ILLEGAL FOR THE OPPOSING
TEAM TO USE BATS.
FEBRUARY 16th,ER EARNINGS
AND MANUFACTURING DATA COMES
IN BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
THE STOCK MARKET WENT UP 170
POINTS, NO SURPRISE THE
BANKS WITH PAGE MONEY ON
THAT DAY BUT ON FEBRUARY 4th
UNEMPLOYMENT NEWS SENDS THE
MARKET DOWN 268 POINTS.
THE BANK STILL MADE MONEY.
MARCH 2nd, THE MARKET DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING, DOWN 2, THE
BANKS MADE MONEY.
JANUARY 25th.
KISS RANG THE OPENING BELL,
WOULD YOU THINK THAT WOULD
GIVE INVESTORS PAUSE BUT NO,
THEY MADE MONEY.
ON MARCH 12th, DRAGONS
ATTACK WALL STREET, THE
BANKS STILL MADE MONEY.
TURNS OUT THE BANKS HAD
CORNERED THE MARKET ON FIRE.
WHAT IS GOING ON!
AND BY THE WAY T WASN'T LIKE
EVERY DAY THEY SQUEAKED INTO
THE BLACK.
>> BANK OF AMERICA MAKING A
GOOD DEAL OF MONEY.
TRY ABOUT $3.2 BILLION WORTH
OF MONEY IN THE FIRST
QUARTER.
>> GOLDMAN SACHS AVERAGED
ABOUT $25 MILLION A DAY.
>> CITIGROUP AT 4.4 BILLION.
>> JPMORGAN MADE AT LEAST
$118 MILLION A DAY.
THAT COMES DOWN TO ABOUT $5
MILLION AN HOUR.
>> Jon: OH, REALLY.
I THINK WE HAVE VIDEO OF HOW
IN THE BLACK THEY ARE.
CAN WE TAKE A LOOK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THEY COULDN'T LOSE.
WE COULD LOSE.
WE DID LOSE.
HOW IS THAT?
>> IT'S A REAL UNUSUAL
CREDIT MARKET ENVIRONMENT
FOR TRADERS RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: YES, IT IS SOMEWHAT
UNUSUAL.
IF BY UNUSUAL YOU MEAN THE
FEDERAL RESERVE IS LENDING
TO THE BANKS AT 0%, YEAH
THAT IS KIND OF UNUSUAL.
AND WHAT ARE THE BANKS DOING
WITH THE FREE MONEY.
>> TREASURIES, TRADING AT A
HUGE VOLUME, WITH THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT SEEKING SO MUCH
MONEY TO FINANCE TARP.
>> Jon: I SEE, SO WHAT IS
HAPPENING IS THEY'RE TAKING
THE BAILOUT MONEY, WE GAVE
THEM, AND LENDING IT BACK TO
THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR
THE BAILOUT.
AND THEN CHARGING THE
GOVERNMENT INTEREST.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OUR GOVERNMENT IS
THE WORST LOAN SHARK IN
HISTORY.
>>
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU GOT MY MONEY.
NO?
WELL, HERE.
TAKE MORE OF MY MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NO, YOU'LL TAKE IT.
DON'T MAKE ME BREAK MY
THUMBS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I ACTUALLY, I
GIVE UP.
YOU WIN.
THE BANKS WIN.
WE'RE WAVING THE WHITE FLAG.
JUST TAKE THE [BLEEP] MONEY,
I DON'T EVEN CARE AT THIS
POINT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, TAKE THE FLAG,
I DON'T CARE, JUST GO, MAKE
THE MONEY, TAKE THE MONEY,
THE REST OF US ARE GOING IT
TO START A NEWS-BASED
ECONOMY.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE
JUST GOING TO HAVE TO PRAY
NOBODY ON
