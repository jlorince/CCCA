>> Jon: HEY, I HAD TO
TURN-- WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART,
GUEST TONIGHT NBC NEWS
ANCHORMAN BRIAN, BRIAN,
BRIAN WILLIAMS.
ACTUALLY, FATHER OF DAILY
SHOW CORRESPONDENT JESSICA
WILLIAMS, TRUE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FIRST OF ALL, LET'S GET
TO SOME SERIOUS STUFF.
ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE.
THE ABOUT THE UNITED STATES
BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE WAR
IN SYRIA.
SLOW DOWN, AMERICA.
REMEMBER OUR TROOPS ARE
STILL IN AFGHANISTAN AND WE
STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
FOR SURE WHO WON THE IRAQ
WAR.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE NOMINEES, A WINNER
OF THE IRAQ WAR ARE IRAQ.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
AND DANIEL-DAY LEWIS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE WINNER OF THE 2003
TO 2011 IRAQ WAR IS --
>> ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
"NEW YORK TIMES," CHINA IS
THE BIGGEST WINNER, ECONOMIC
WINNER FROM THE IRAQ WAR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THEY WEREN'T EVEN
NOMINATED!
CHINA IS NOT EVEN IN THE
RUNNING.
DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE IN A
WAR TO WIN IT?
CHINA?
CHINA, THEY HAVE ALREADY
BEATEN US IN SYNCHRONIZED
DRUMMING AND BEAR CUTENESS,
AIR CHEW ABILITY.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU GOT TO TAKE THIS FROM US
TOO?
>> CHINA IS THE LEADING
BUYER OF IRAQ OIL PURCHASING
IS 1.5 MILLION BARRELS A DAY
OR HALF OF IRAQ'S OUTPUT.
>> Jon: CHINA IS BUYING
THAT?
HUH?
I GUESS ALL THOSE PROTESTORS
WERE WRONG.
THEY HAD THE NO IN THE WRONG
PLACE.
YES, THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED.
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
WE DIED FOR THE NO OIL.
HOW DID CHINA GET TO BUY ALL
THE OIL IN IRAQ?
>> CHINA HAS SPENT MORE THAN
$2 BILLION AND SENT HUNDREDS
OF WORKERS INTO IRAQ TO
SECURE A STAKE IN THE OIL
BUSINESS.
(LAUGHTER)
IRAQ YOU AWARDED ALL YOUR
OIL CONTRACTS TO CHINA,
IRAQ.
I MEAN COME ON, MAN.
WE LAUNCHED A SUSTAINED
SHOCK AND AWE BOMBING
CAMPAIGN ON YOUR COUNTRY.
WE REDUCED YOUR ALREADY
STRESSED INFRASTRUCTURE TO
RUBBLE AND UNLEASHED
SECTARIAN CONFLICT THAT EVEN
NOW COST YOUR COUNTRY
HUNDREDS OF LIVES PER MONTH.
AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY
US?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU UNGRATEFUL-- CHINA
THINKS OH, WE SPENT $2
BILLION, REBUILDING IRAQ
INFRASTRUCTURE.
BIG [BLEEP] DEAL!
WHEN WE WERE IN IRAQ WE
SPENT $2 BILLION JUST
LOOKING FOR THE OTHER $9
BILLION WE LOST.
APPARENTLY WE SHIPPED IT TO
IRAQ IN A CONTAIN THEIR SAID
$9 BILLION AND SOMEONE RAN
OFF WITH IT.
WELL, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A
CUTOUT OF GEORGE W. BUSH.
WOULD WE HAVE TO CUT HIM
OUT?
I THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE
THAT PICTURE OF HIM JUST
WITH A DIFFERENT SIGN.
I DON'T KNOW BY THE WAY IF
THAT ACTUALLY SAYS MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED IN MANDARIN
THAT ACTUALLY COULD SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT GENERAL
