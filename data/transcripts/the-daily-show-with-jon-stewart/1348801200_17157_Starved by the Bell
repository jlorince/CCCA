>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WHOA, WE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU, JOINING US FROM THE NEW YORK KNICKER BOCKERS BASKETBALL CLUB MR. AMARE STOUDEMIRE
WILL BE JOINING US.
WE WILL TRADE NOTES ON HOW EACH OF US CELEBRATED YOM KIPPUR.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE TENSIONS IN SYRIA, IRAN, THROUGHOUT THE MIDEAST.
BUT THERE IS A BATTLE BREWING MUCH CLOSER TO HOME.
>> TONIGHT THE FOOD FIGHT SWEEPING SCHOOL CAFETERIAS NATIONWIDE.
>> STUDENTS WHO SAY HEALTHY LUNCHES NOW MANDATED UNDER FEDERAL GUIDELINES ARE LEAVING THEM HUNGRY.
>> Jon: NEWS FLASH!
EXTRA EXTRA, CHILDREN THINK SCHOOL LUNCHES SUCK.
(LAUGHTER) WE NOW GO OUT TO OUR OWN CAPTAIN OBVIOUS WHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY SINCE SCHOOLS BEGAN SERVING LUNCH.
(LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
>> SMALLER PORTIONS, FEWER CALORIES, LESS MEAT AND CHEESE, AND MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
>> SOME KIDS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THEIR LUNCH DOESN'T FILL THEM UP.
>> THE NEW RULES LIMIT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLERS TO 650-- 650 CALL REERX 700 CALORIES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND 850 FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS.
>> Jon: EXTRA EXTRA, SCHOOL LUNCHES SUCK!
AND THE PORTIONS ARE TOO SMALL.
(LAUGHTER) SO YOU HATE THE FOOD AND YOU WANT MORE OF IT.
BUT I GUESS LOOK F THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY POLICING STUDENTS AND RESES-- RESTRICTING THEIR CALORIC INTAKE THAT DOES
SEEM A BIT DRACONIAN.
>> DESPITE CALORIE LIMITS STUDENTS CAN ALWAYS GET SECONDS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
>> Jon: OH, SURE, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, LIKE THAT COUNTS AS FOOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT MY SCHOOL, NERD GRENADES.
AND I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I GOT HIT BY A LOT OF NERD GRENADES.
(LAUGHTER) I THOUGHT MY NICK NAME WAS INCOMING.
(LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, SURE.
THIS IS ONLY FOR LUNCHES THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND SURE, YOU'RE ALLOW UNLIMB THED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
BUT A THIRD OF OUR KIDS ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE.
AND IF THIS KEEPS UP FROM THE GOVERNMENT WE ARE NEVER GETTING THAT ABOVE 50%.
(LAUGHTER) I'M STILL NOT CLEAR ON WHY THEY'RE HUNGRY.
>> AT SOME SCHOOLS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD THROWN OUT IN CAFETERIAS IS SHOCKING.
>> KIDS ARE NOW THROWING AWAY TWICE AS MUCH FOOD AS LAST YEAR.
>> Jon: HMMMM, NOW I AM OBVIOUSLY NOT A NUTRITIONIST OR AN EDUCATOR BUT I THINK IF THESE KIDS ARE HUNGRY I
GUESS MY SOLUTION WOULD BE, EAT YOUR MOTHER [BLEEP]
LUNCH!
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHOSE'S NOT HUNGRY IN YOUR OLD PAL REMMY COUNTING OUT IN THE DUMPSTER.
