NOW THE QUESTION OF COURSEWAS YESTERDAY'S ATTACK IN
TEXAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENTOR PART OF A MORE MENACING
TREND BECAUSE WE HAVE BEENHEARING ABOUT THIS
FICTIONALLY FOR A WHILE NOW.
>> AT LEAST TEN ISIS FIGHTERSHAVE BEEN
CAUGHT COMING OVER THE MEXICANBORDER IN TEXAS.
>> ISIS KNOCKING ON OURTEXAS BORDER.
>> Jon: OH, WELL THAT'S EASY --JUST DON'T ANSWER.
WHEN ISIS KNOCKS, YOU JUST SHUTTHE LIGHTS OUT AND LIE
THERE.
BUT NEVER FEAR, UNCLE SAM IS TOTHE GOING TO LET ISIS RING
AND RUN YOU, TEXAS.
IN FACT, NOT ONLY IS THEU.S. MILITARY CONDUCTING
TRAINING OPS RIGHT NOW FORMISSIONS AGAINST
ISIS-LIKE GROUPS, GUESS WHERETHEY ARE DOING WITH THEM.
>> TEXAS IS ONE OF SEVENSTATES WHERE THE EXERCISES
WILL BE HELD.
>> THE SPECIALS FORCES TRAININGOPERATION CALLED JADE HELM
15.
>> Jon: OH, JADE HELM 15, IHAVE THAT ISSUE.
IT'S-- IT'S-- IMPRISONS CAPTAINAMERICAN JADEOPOLIS, I THINK --
REST EASY, TEXAS! GOOD GUYS WITHGUNS ARE ON THE CASE.
>> CONSPIRACY THEORIES AREONE RUNNING WILD TONIGHT ABOUT
THE ARMY'S PLAN FOR A MULTISTATETRAINING EXERCISE THIS
SUMMER CALLED JADE HELM 15.
WHILE THE MILITARY SAYS IT'SJUST TRAINING SOLDIERS FOR
THE REALITIES OF WAR,CRITICS SAY THE ARMY IS
PREPARING FOR MODERN DAYMARTIAL LAW.
>> SOME ARE CALLING IT ATEXAS TAKEOVER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHO IS
CALLING IT A TEXASTAKEOVER?
LONE STAR LUNATICS.
DALLAS [BLEEP] AND HOUSTON[BLEEP] HOLES.
TEXAS, THERE IS NO TEXASTAKEOVER.
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTALREADY CONTROLS TEXAS.
SINCE LIKE THE 1840s. AND THENHE LEFT AND HE CAME
BACK AND -- JUST BORROW ATEXTBOOK FROM A NEIGHBORING
STATE, IT IS ALL IN THERE.
HERE IS HOW UNBELLIGERENT --HERE IS HOW UNBELLIGERENT THE
U.S. MILITARY IS TOWARDSTEXAS.
THEY SENT A LIEUTENANTCOLONEL TO A LOCAL TEXAS
TOWN HALL TO WASTE HIS TIME.
>> ALL WE WANT TO DO IS MAKESURE THAT OUR GUYS ARE
TRAINED FOR COMBAT OVERSEAS.
>> IT IS A PREPARATION FORMARTIAL LAW.
>> THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS NOT APREPARATION FOR MARTIAL LAW,
SIR. >> THAT IS WHAT YOU SAY.
>> WE REALLY, TRULY WANT-- .
>> Jon: YOU SEE THAT RIGHTTHERE?
THAT RIGHT THERE?
THAT IS THE FACE OF SOMEONEREALIZING THEY'RE NOT
GETTING AROUND THE PUBLICCOMMENTS ON THE PLANNED
PARKING LOT DOWN BY KROGERS,NOT TODAY.
NOT IN THIS MEETING.
>> Jon: BUT COME ON CRAZYPEOPLE ATTEND LOCAL TOWN
HALL MEETING ISN'T A TEXASSPECIFIC STORY, I BELIEVE THE
CONSTITUTION SAYS YOUCAN'T HOLD A TOWN HALL
MEETING WITHOUT CRAZY PEOPLE.
I THINK IT'S IN THERE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS BEINGTAKEN SERIOUSLY BY ANYONE
WHO HOLDS ACTUAL POWER.
>> ON TUESDAY GOVERNOR GREGABBOTT ORDERED THE TEXAS
STATE GUARD TO MONITORMILITARY PERSONNEL MOVEMENTS
AND TRAINING EXERCISESCHEDULES AND ENSURE THAT
SAFETY AND CONSTITUTIONALRIGHTS OF TEXANS WERE NOT
BEING VIOLATED.
>> Jon: OH DEAR LORD.
(LAUGHTER)YET ANOTHER WASTE OF
TEXAS FUNDS THAT COULD HAVEBEEN SPENT ON ACTUAL THREATS
LIKE YOUR INFAMOUS CHAINSAWMASSACRES.
I MEAN, TEXAS, IT'S NOT AS IF IDON'T FIND IT ADORABLE THAT
YOUR GOVERNOR THINKS YOURSTATE GUARD COULD TAKE ON THE
UNITED STATES MILITARY. IT'SLIKE A LITTLE DOG GROWLING AT A
BIG DOG OR-- OR ANEIGHT-YEAR-OLD PICKING A
FIGHT WITH THE PREDATOR.
BUT ENOUGH OF THEFEARMONGERING.
YOU KNOW THESE TYPES OFEXERCISES HAVE BEEN GOING ON
IN TEXAS FOR YEARS, RIGHT?
>> YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MARINE AIROUT HERE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
MARINE GROUND, ARMYGROUND,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AIR FORCEHERE, NAVY AIR, ALL FIGHTING
JOINTLY, IT'S GOOD EXERCISE.
>> YEAH, IN TEXAS! OPERATIONROVING SANDS.
IN FACT THE 2001ROVING SANDS OPERATION WAS
THE LARGEST EXERCISE OF ITSKIND IN HISTORY.
BUT DID THEN PRE-OOPS GOVERNORRICK PERRY START SPREADING FEAR
ABOUT A TEXAS TAKEOVER?
HE DID NOT.
TEXAS WAS FINE WITH THECONCEPT OF WIDESPREAD
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THEIRSTATE.
IN THE 20-OTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HASCHANGED SINCE THEN, OH,
RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)>> AMERICA ELECTED A BRUTAL
SOCIALIST MUSLIM KENYANINEFFECTIVE HARVARD SCHOOLED
CONSTITUTIONAL PROFESSORAGITATOR WARLOCK.
SO TEXAS-- IT APPEARS, ITAPPEARS YOU ARE ON THE VERGE
OF BEING TAKEN OVER BY ISISOR THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
SO YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.
AND WHEN YOU MAKE IT, JUSTREMIND YOURSELF, AND I NEVER
THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAYINGTHIS, WHAT WOULD RICK PERRY
DO?
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
