>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE
"DAILY SHOW" LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN!
I'M JON STEWART.
POLITICAL AUTHOR JONATHAN ALTER
WILL BE JOINING US.
WE BEGIN WITH THE BIG POLITICAL
STORY OF...
YESTERDAY
( LAUGHTER )
LAST NIGHT, BARACK OBAMA
DELIVERED HIS SECOND STATE OF
THE UNION ADDRESS, ALONG WITH
WHAT APPEARS TO LOOK LIKE A
BUDDY COMEDY SCREEN PLAY HE
BELIEVES JOE BIDEN AND JOHN
BOEHNER WOULD BE PERFECT FOR.
IT'S CALLED WATER WORKS AND
MOTORMOUTH.
JOHN BOEHNER IS RALPH WATERWORKS
AND JOE BIDEN WON'T SHUT UP.
ANYHOW-- LAST NIGHT WAS A BIT
UNUSUAL.
N THAT TO HONOR RECUPERATING
COLLEAGUE GABBY GIFFORDSS
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SAT
TOGETHER RISKING PHYSICAL
CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE
WITH THEM POLITICALLY.
JOHN McCAIN AND JOHN KERRY
NATURALLY PAIRED OFF.
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND AND JOHN
THUNE SAT TOGETHER TO REMIND
EVERYONE IF THE SENATE WAS EVER
CALLED UPON TO REPOPULATE THE
EARTH, THESE TWO WOULD PROBABLY
BE OUR BEST SHOT.
LAYOFF LAUGH
( APPLAUSE ).
OF COURSE, THE FIRST THING ANY
PRESIDENT HAS TO DO IS COME OUT
AND TELL EVERYONE THE STATE OF
THE UNION IS STRONG.
>> AMERICA'S FALLEN TO NINTH IN
THE PROPORTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE
WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE.
THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN
IT TAKES IN.
COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND RUSSIA
INVEST MORES IN THE ROADS AND
RALE WAYS THAN WE DO.
CHINA IS BUILDING FASTER TRAINS.
WHEN OUR OWN ENGINEERS GRADED
OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE,
THEY GAVE US A "D."
( LAUGHTER )
GLON MY GOD, I THINK THIS MIGHT
BE AN INTERVENTION!
OR THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO
GROUND US.
HEY, MAN!
WE'RE TRYING REALLY HARD!
>> SOUTH KOREAN HOMES NOW HAVE
GREATER INTERNET ACCESS THAN WE
DO.
LAST MONTH WE FINALIZED A TRADE
AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA.
IN SOUTH KOREA, TEACHERS ARE
DESCRIBED AS NATION BUILDERS.
>> Jon:  WE'RE NOT SOUTH
KOREANS AND WE NEVER WILL BE!
HE HAS A POINT.
SOUTH KOREA IS DOING WELL THESE
DAYS.
IT'S AS THOUGH THEY HAVE
THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS TAKING
CARE OF THEIR MILITARY NEEDS SO
THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY.
LIKE ALL GOOD COACHES, AFTER
TEARING US DOWN, COACH OBAMA
BUILTs BACK UP.
>> THIS IS A COUNTRY WHERE
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, NO MATTER
WHO YOU ARE.
NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM.
AS CONTENTIOUS AND FRUSTRATING
AND MESSY AS OUR DEMOCRACY CAN
SOMETIMES BE, I KNOW THERE ISN'T
A PERSON HERE WHO WOULD TRADE
PLACES WITH ANY OTHER NATION ON
EARTH
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  EXCEPT MAYBE SOUTH
KOREA WITH THEIR...
WIFI INTERNET ACCESS
( LAUGHTER )
TRADE AGREEMENTS!
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO NICE TO US
ALL OF A SUDDEN.
>> HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN THE
SOVIET UNIONS BEAT US INTO SPACE
WITH THE LAUNCH OF SPUTNIK, WE
HAD NO IDEA HOW WE WOULD BEAT
THEM TO THE MOON.
WE UNLEASHED A WAVE OF
INNOVATIONS THAT CREATED NEW
INDUSTRIES AND MILLIONS OF NEW
JOBS.
THIS IS OUR GENERATION'S SPUTNIK
MOMENT.
>> Jon:  ( BLEEP )!
GO HOME!
I'M WITH YOU.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
THE MOON?
MARS?
PLUTO?
PANDORA FOR THEIR RESERVES OF
DLIRS UNORBTANIUM?
>> WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS,
WE'LL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR
BUSINESSES TO DEPLOY THE NEXT
GENERATION OF HIGH-SPEED
WIRELESS COVERAGE TO 98% OF ALL
AMERICANS.
WITHIN 25 YEARS OUR GOAL IS TO
GIVE 80% OF AMERICANS ACCESS TO
HIGH-SPEED RAIL AND BECOME THE
FIRST COUNTRY TO HAVE A MILLION
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY
2015.
>> Jon:  THAT'S OUR SPUTNIK
MOMENT.
THEIRS WAS WE HAVE 10 YEARS TO
REACH THE MOON AND OURS WAS WE
HAVE 25 YEARS TO MAKE SURE 80%
OF US LIVE NEAR SOMEWHAT FASTER
TRAIN?
IT'S LIKE TELLING VINCE LOMBARDI
TELLING THE PACKERS I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE EVERYTHING ON THE
FIELD.
NOW GET OUT THERE AND COVER THE
SPREAD!
OF COURSE, THE EVENING WASN'T
ALL TRAINS AND WIFIS PURPOSE
THERE WERE HUMAN STORIES, REAL
AMERICANS WHO, BY INCREDIBLE
LUCK, HAPPENED TO BE IN THE
AUDIENCE THIS VERY NICE.
>> ONE MOTHER OF TWO, A WOMAN
NAMED KATHY PROCTOR HWORKED IN
THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY SINCE SHE
WAS 18 YEARS OLD.
AND SHE TOLD ME SHE'S EARNING
HER DEGREE IN BIOTECHNOLOGY NOW.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  IT WAS ACTUALLY AN
INCREDIBLY GENUINE HUMAN MOMENT
AND VERY LOVELY, ALTHOUGH
SOMEWHAT UNDERCUT BY HER
BEHAVIOR LATER IN THE SPEECH.
>> THAT DREAM IS A STORY OF A
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER NAMED BRAND
BRANDON FISHER.
THAT DREAM IS WHY A WORKING
CLASS KID FROM SCRANTON CAN SIT
BEHIND ME, HALFWAY ACROSS THE
WORLD.
33 MEN WERE TRAPPED IN THE
CHILEAN MINE.
>> Jon:  YOU HAD YOUR
MOMENT!
LET THE MINERS HAVE THEIR
MOMENT!
OF COURSE, MISPROCTOR WASN'T THE
ONLY ONE IN THE AUDIENCE EXCITED
BY THEIR PRESIDENTIAL SHOUT-OUT.
>> OF COURSE AS WE SPEAK,
AL QAEDA AND HIRE AFFILIATES
CONTINUE TO PLAN ATTACKS AGAINST
US.
WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE FIGHT TO
AL QAEDA, AND THEIR ALLIES
ABROAD.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  I DON'T-- I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY
