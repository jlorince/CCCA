[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THEPROGRAM, THE ROLLOUT OF THE
PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CAREINITIATIVE HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY
ONE APPARENTLY NOW WITH THE WEBSITE PUNCHING PEOPLE IN THE
DICK.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT'S WHY YOU CAN HARDLY TURN ON
A TV THESE DAYS WITHOUT SEEING AMEDICAL EXPERT PROVIDING
GUIDANCE.
>> NOW FOR PEOPLE WHO GO TO THEMARKETPLACE WHO ALREADY HAVE
INSURANCE THEY SHOULD CHECKAHEAD OF TIME TO FIND OUT
BECAUSE IT COULD INFLUENCE WHATTHEY ARE PAYING IN COPAYS AND
DEDUCTIBLES.
>> AS OF JANUARY 1,COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES WILL BE
AVAILABLE.
THIS IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE.
>> Jon: WAIT WHAT?
WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?
THAT SEEMED LESS LIKE MEDICALTHAT SADVICE AND MORE LIKECAL
THANKSGIVING WITH YOURCRAZY REPUBLICAN UNCLE.
THIS IS SOCIALISM.
THAT'S DR. MANNY ALVAREZ, AVALUED MEMBER OF FOX'S MEDICAL
A-TEAM.
THERE'S NO MR. T THERE.
I SEE ALL GEORGE PAPARRD'S NOMR. T.
PAPARD REFERENCE WHAT IS UP?
ALVAREZ IS THERE BECAUSE HE HASTHE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE
THE A-TEAM.
>> HEMORRHOIDS, ERECTILEDYSFUNCTION, MAN BOOBS, WHATEVER
YOU CALL THEM, MAN BOOBS ORMOOBS.
>> Jon: MAN BOOBS OR -- I CALLTHEM BROASTS, BOYBIES,
CHESTNUTS, MAN-OR IES.
BROKEBACK MOUNTAINS.
[ LAUGHTER ]REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT PUSHED YOU OVER THEEDGE?
I GUESS MEDICAL ADVICE ISN'TREALLY THE FOCUS OF FOX'S
MEDICAL EXPERTS.
THEY SERVE A MUCH MORE IMPORTANTPURPOSE TO AGREE WITH FOX NEWS
TALKING POINTS.
SAY THE PRESIDENT WANTS EVERYONETO HAVE INSURANCE, WHO BETTER TO
SAY THAT'S A BAD IDEA THAN ADOCTOR?
>> BEFORE THEY STARTED THIS WEWERE ALL IN TROUBLE WITH
INSURANCE TO BEGIN WITH.
THERE'S TOO MUCH HEALTHINSURANCE, IT COVERS TOO MUCH,
TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: CONGRATULATIONS, I'VE
NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]THERE'S JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE.
HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH HEALTHCARE, TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE
INSURANCE AND FOOD AND SHELTER.
I JUST DOESN'T FEEL SPECIAL IFEVERYONE HAS IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT THESE DOCTORS DON'T JUST
TAKE ON OBAMACARE, THEY AREMEDICAL EXPERTISE CARRIES OVER
TO ANY FOX TALKING POINT.
>> RIGHT NEW WE FEEL LIKE IT'SUNAMERICAN TO BE A PATRIOTIC
AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> EVERYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY ATEVERY LEVEL IS ABOUT REGULATION.
IT'S VERY SUSPICIOUS THAT APRESIDENT IS NOT COMING FORWARD
WITH HIS COLLEGE RECORDS.
>> MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN ANDA WOMAN.
NO GROUP BE THEY GAYS, BE THEYNAMBLA, BE THEY PEOPLE WHO
BELIEVE IN BESTIALITY, THEYDON'T GET TO CHANGE THE
DEFINITION.
>> Jon: NO GROUP, BE THEY FOXNEWS DOCTORS OR SERIAL RAPISTS.
I'M NOT SAYING THEY AREEQUIVALENT, I JUST PUT THE TWO
OF THEM IN A SENTENCE TOGETHER.
IT'S NEUROSURGEON BEN CARSON ANDHE WASN'T A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR
WHEN HE SAID THAT.
IT WAS AFTER THEY HEARD IT THEYITSAID HIRE THAT GUY. YOU KNOWY
VLADIMIR LENIN>> ONE OF FOUNDERS OF COMMUNISM
HE SAID SOCIALIZED MEDICINE ISTHE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH TO THE
SOCIALIST STATE.
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAVE TO GETTHE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE AS THE
FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT GIVES YOUCONTROL OF THE PEOPLE.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO NITPICK THE DOCTOR HERE BUT
HISTORICALLY VLADIMIR LENINNEVER ACTUALLY SAID THAT.
IT'S A MADE UP QUOTE ANDARCHITECTURALLY, THE
KEYSTONE AND THE FOUNDATION AREDIFFERENT THINGS.
ONE IS AT THE TOP AND ONE IS ATTHE BOTTOM.
MY POINT IS THESE GUYS SEEM LESSLIKE EXPERT DOCTORS AND MORE
LIKE THE SHADY EXPERTWITNESSES PAID BY THE DEFENSE
TO SAY THAT THE BULLET WOUND ISMAYBE A THIRD NIPPLE, I DON'T
KNOW. I'M NOT A DOCTOR, BUT'TTHESE DOCTORS SEEM CRAZY.
WHAT FOX REALLY NEEDS IS ANIN-HOUSE PSYCHIATRIST.
>> JOINING US NOW IS FOX NEWSIN-HOUSE PSYCHIATRIST DR. KEITH
ABLOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THIS ISN'T GOING TO
WORK OUT WELL.
DR. KEITH ABLOW DESPITE THE FACTTHAT HE IS A MENTAL HEALTH
PROFESSIONAL WITH A SEGMENTPRCALLED NORMAL OR NUTS, I CAN
ONLYHOPE HE IS THE VOICE OF SANITY
AND REASON.
>> DO YOU REALLY BELIEVECHILDREN ARE GOING TO TURN
TRANSGENDER FROM WATCHING CHAZBONO?
YES.
THE DEFENSE RESTS.
