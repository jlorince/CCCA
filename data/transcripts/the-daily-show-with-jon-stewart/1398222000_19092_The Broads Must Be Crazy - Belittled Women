OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE SEEMSTO BE A CONCERN FOR
EMOTIONALITY, WHEN IT COMESTO WOMEN IN POLITICS. LIKE
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON COMING OFFAN UPSET LOSS IN IOWA LET HER
GUARD DOWN AT A NEW HAMPSHIRECAMPAIGN EVENT.
>> HILLARY CLINTON GETTING ALLMISTY EYES WHEN TALKING TO
VOTERS EARLIER TODAY.
>> IT WAS AS CLOSE TO ABREAKDOWN AS I'VE EVER SEEN
HILLARY HAVE. I MEAN, SHE ISJUST LETTING HER EMOTIONS
FALL OUT OF HER.>> CAN'T HELP IT.
>> CAN'T HELP IT. BEWILDERED,FRUSTRATED.
>> WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WHOBREAK DOWN AND START CRYING AT
THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENTS.
>> OF COURSE WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.AND THAT CANDIDATE PUDDLE THAT
WAS HILLARY CLINTON ISN'T FIT TOSERVE WITH OUR STRONGER MORE
STABLE MALE POLITICIANS.
YOU KNOW HOW THE LADIES ARE WITHTHE -- (LAUGHING).
>> WHEN I THINK OF WHAT KYLE HASMEANT TO ME OVER THE PAST 15
YEARS.
>> IT'S MY SON. GOD ALMIGHTY!
>> MAKING SURE THAT THESE KIDSHAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN
DREAM.
MY GOD,  IT'S IMPORTANT.
[ Laughter ]>> STOP IT, STOP IT, THAT MAN IS
NOT CRYING.
HE'S A MALE.
HE'S NOT CRYING.
HE'S WEARING HIS FAVORITE ONIONSHIRT.
THAT'S AN ONION SHIRT. IT'SDIFFERENT. AND BESIDES, IT'S NOT
JUST WOMEN CRYING, IT'S THE MOODSWINGS. THE OTHER STUFF.
>> HILLARY SEEMS TO HAVE A WHOLELOT OF ANGER.
>> WHY IS SHE SO DARN ANGRY?
>> YEAH, WHAT IS (BLEEP) WRONGWITH HER?
CALM THE (bleep) DOWN LADY?CAUSE THAT'S THE THING, IF YOU
WANT TO BE IN POLITICS,
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN HOW TOCONTROL YOUR TEMPER.
>> IF YOU CONDUCT YOURSELFLIKE THAT IN THE COURTROOM YOUR
REAR END IS GOING TO GET THROWNIN JAIL, IDIOT.
DID I SAY ON TOPIC? ARE YOUSTUPID?
>> DAMN MAN I'M GOVERNOR, CANYOU JUST SHUT UP FOR A SECOND?
>> THANK YOU, EXACTLY.
THAT'S HOW YOU HANDLE GOVERNMENTBUSINESS.
CALM, COOL, COLLECTED.
BUT THE LADIES, ONE MINUTE, YAHYAH YAH YAH AND THEN THE NEXT
MINUTE THEY'RE GIVING YOU THESILENT TREATMENT.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE APROCEDURAL QUESTION.
MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE A PROCEDUREQUESTION.
MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU CANNOT RUN ACOMMITTEE LIKE THIS.
>> REPUBLICAN ACCUSATION  INTHIS INVESTIGATION --
>> WE'RE ADJOURNED.

RESOLUTION IS HANDLED MATURELYBY MALES.

>> Jon: OKAY, THAT'S WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT!
[APPLAUSE]YOU KNOW,
>> THE BEST PART OF THE ENTIREBIT IS THE WOMAN SITTING BEHIND
REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG WHO SITS UPIN STUNNED DISBELIEVING
ADMIRATION.
THAT IS JUST PURE ADMIRATION.
AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF MALEDISCOURSE IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE.
I'M SURPRISED SHE WAS ABLE TOKEEP QUIET.
AS EXCITABLE AS THE LADIES GETSOMETIMES.
(LAUGHING).
>> YOU KNOW THE LADIES WITH THESCREAMING.
AT LEAST THAT LADY HAD TIMETO PUT HERSELF TOGETHER, PUT HER
FACE ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOWVAIN THE LADIES CAN BE, YOU
KNOW HOW THE LADIES ARE ALWAYSTHINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOKLIKE.
NOW RIGHT ABOUT NOW, YOU MAY BETHINKING TO YOURSELF, BUT
JON IN YOUR ZEAL TO MAKE A CASETHAT WOMEN ARE TOO EMOTIONAL
AND UNPREDICTABLE TOHOLD PUBLIC OFFICE, YOU SEEM
ALMOST MADE AN OPPOSITECASE. SHOWCASING, HIGHLIGHTING,
INSTANCES WHERE RESPECTED MALESOFFICIALS APPEAR TO BE NOT
IN TOTAL CONTROL OF THEIREMOTIONAL, LET'S CALL IT
SELVES -- MY FRIEND I SEE THECRITICAL MISTAKE YOU HAVE MADE
IN YOUR THINKING.
FOR ALL THOSE EXAMPLES OF MALEEMOTION ARE IN FACT NOT NEGATIVE
BUT POSITIVE.
>> TAKES A LOT MORE COURAGE FORA POLITICIAN TO CRY ON
TELEVISION. THAN ITDOES TO BE TOUGH.
>> LOOK AT THE PASSION BEHINDTHIS GUY.
>> CONGRESSMAN WE LOVE IT WHENYOU GET FIBERY LIKE THAT.
>> STRAIGHT SHOOTER. HE'S TOUGH.HE'LL TAKE ON HECKLERS.
>> YOU SEE AN HONEST OPENGOVERNOR THAT DOES SHOW EMOTION.
>> HE WAS FORCEFUL. HE WAS VERYAGGRESSIVE.
>> HE WAS AGGRESSIVE,  HE WASPRESIDENTIAL.
>> THAT'S A MAN'SMAN. WHO GETS CHOKED UP ABOUT
ABOUT HIS COUNTRY AND ABOUT THETHINGS HE FEELS PASSIONATE
ABOUT. ALL OF A SUDDEN FEELINGPASSION FOR AMERICA AND THE
HOPES FOR HIS FELLOWAMERICANS IS SOMETHING EVIL?
>> SO THAT'S REALLY THELESSON WE HAVE LEARNED TODAY. IN
POLITICS IT'S OKAY TO BE A PUSSYAS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A DICK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
