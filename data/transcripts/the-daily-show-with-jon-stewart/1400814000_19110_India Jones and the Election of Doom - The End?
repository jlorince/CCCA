LAST WEEK, INDIA ELECTED A NEWPRIME MINISTER, NARENDRA MODI.
TONIGHT, JASON JONES FILES HISFINAL REPORT FROM INDIA,
EXAMINING THIS NEW LEADER.
♪♪>> IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT TO ITS
INCUMBENT PARTY, INDIA HASCHOSEN A NEW LEADER, BUT THERE'S
ONLY ONE QUESTION THE AMERICANMEDIA HAS ABOUT THE NEW PRIME
MINISTER, NARENDRA MODI.
>> WHAT IF ANYTHING DOES THEU.S. HAVE TO FEAR FROM THIS MAN?
>> HE'S CONSERVATIVE, HE'SA HINDU NATIONALIST.
>> HE HAS AN UGLY PAST.
>> SOME PEOPLE VIEW HIM ASMAYBE BEING IN THE AUTHORITARIANMODE.
>> YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANENEMY OF THIS MAN.
>> ACCORDING TO US, INDIA HASJUST ELECTED THIS GUY --
(SCREAMING)BUT EVEN INDIAN JOURNALISTS
STILL HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ASK NARENDRAMODI WHY HASN'T HE HELD HIMSELF
TRULY ACCOUNTABLE.
I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT IF1,000 PEOPLE DIE UNDER YOUR
WATCH WHEN YOU'RE CHIEF MINISTEREITHER YOU'RE INCOMPETENT,
YOU'RE COMPLICIT OR BOTH.
>> WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO WASTHIS.
>> IT WAS DURING HIS TENURE THATAT LEAST A THOUSAND TEAM MOSTLY
MUSLIMS WERE KILLED DURING THERELIGIOUS RIOTS IN 2002.
>> AND MODI REFUSES TO ADDRESSTHIS CONTROVERSY.
BUT LET'S REMEMBER, I'M THE GUYWHO WENT TO RUSSIA AND GOT
GORBACHEV'S NUMBER ON THE BLACKMARKET, SO THERE WAS NO WAY I
WAS GOING ALL THE WAY TO INDIAAND NOT GETTING AN INTERVIEW
WITH MODI.
OH, IS, IS THAT, IS THAT HIM?
THAT'S MODI?
HEY, AFTER ALL THAT IS SAID ANDDONE, MR. MODI, AFTER THE 2002
2002 GUJRAT RIOTS DO YOU EXPRESSANY, ANY REMORSE WHATSOEVER?
>> HE'S SEEMS TO BE  MODI.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SEEMS TOBE MODI?
>> HE SEEMS TO BE MODI. HE LIKEMODI. HE'S NOT MODI.
>> THIS IS A MODI LOOKALIKE?
>> LOOK LIKE MODI, YEAH.
>> AH (BLEEP).
OF COURSE MODI WASN'T GOING TOAPPEAR IN PUBLIC, HE WAS THE
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN INDIA.
BUT THEN I SAW A REPORT ONINDIAN TELEVISION THAT HE WAS
ACTUALLY HOLDING ARALLY ACROSS TOWN.
IT'S MODI. MR. MODI, MR. MODI.YOU'VE YET TO EXPRESS
ANY REMORSE. WHY IS THAT?
>> I NEED A TRANSLATOR! I NEED ATRANSLATOR!
OKAY.
HOLD ON.
YOU'RE NOT THE REAL MODI?
LISTEN, I'M NOT SAYING YOU ALLLOOK ALIKE, BUT YOU REALLY LOOK
ALIKE.
>> I LOOK LIKE MODI?
YEAH.
TURNS OUT IN A COUNTRY AS BIGAS THIS, A CANDIDATE CAN'T BE
EVERYWHERE, SO INSTEAD THEYDISPATCH LOOKALIKES TO RALLY THE
VOTERS. AND WHEN I WAS INVARANASI
I SAW MODI DOUBLES, TRIPLES ANDEVEN QUADRUPLES.
>> HE'S SAME AS LOOKING MODIHAS.
>> NO, HE DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHINGLIKE HIM. THIS GUY'S THE WORST
YET. MODI HAD GONETO GREAT LENGTHS
TO DODGE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE2002
RIOTS, BUT ACCORDING TO THIS BJPSPOKESMAN, THAT CASE IS CLOSED.
>> IT'S ONLY A FEW ELITEPEOPLE SITTING IN THE MEDIA WHO
CAN'T REALLY FORGET THEMEMORIES OF 2002.

HAS PRACTICALLY GOT A CLEANSHEET.
>> JUST FOR THE RECORD, YOUSAID CLEAN -- ?

>> WHAT WAS IT?>> CLEAN SHEET.
>> THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LANDHAD CLEARED NARENDRA MODI AND
THE PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTEDTHAT DECISION.
WHAT ABOUT THE CRITICISM OF MODISAYING THAT HE DOESN'T,
HE DOESN'T CAREABOUT THE MUSLIMS.
>> THE SUPREME COURT GAVE HIM ACLEAN SHEET.
>> I THINK I'M LOSING SOMETHINGIN THE TRANSLATION.
CAN WE PUT UP A SUBTITLE?
THE COURTS HAVE GIVEN HIM ACLEAN CHIT.
>> CHIT. CHIT. CHIT.
OH, CHIT MEANS LEGAL RECORD.
OK, WELL I PROMISED MYSELF IWASN'T GOING TO COME TO THIS
VIBRANT DEMOCRACY ANDMAKE CHEAP CHIT JOKES, BUT SINCE
BUT, YOU KNOW, SINCE THEYSTARTED IT.
>> THE HONORABLE COURT OF INDIAHAS GIVEN HIM A CLEAN CHIT,
SO NO QUESTIONS.
>> THERE IS ONE QUESTION. CANYOU EVER REALLY HAVE A CLEANCHIT?
>> 100%, ABSOLUTELY. HIS CLEANCHIT.
>> MUSLIMS ARE SAYING HIS CHITIS STILL DIRTY.
>> SEE, I AM TOO SMALL A PERSONTO, YOU KNOW, GIVE A COMMAND.
>> SO, IFTHE COURT SAYS CLEANCHIT.
>> IT'S A CLEAN CHIT.
>> MODI HAS A CLEAN CHIT, CLEANCHIT, CLEAN CHIT.

♪♪>> AS I JOURNEYED TOWARD THE
FETED HOLY WATERSOF MOTHER GANGA-JI,
MY ENTIRE INDIAN EXPERIENCEBEGAN TO MAKE SENSE.
INDIA TAUGHT ME TO OPEN MYSELFTO NEW CUISINES
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
(SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
NEW STUPID GAMES AND A NEW WAYTO LOSE WEIGHT. AND I REALIZED
AFTER A DECISIVE ELECTION, NOMATTER WHO WINS, EVERYONE
SHOULD JUST SHUT THE (BLEEP) UPAND MOVE ON.
BUT, AS I PREPARED TO STEP INTOTHIS HOLY DUMPING GROUND FOR RAW
SEWAGE AND DEAD BODIES,
I REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANTLESSON I'D LEARNED.
SO WHEN MODI DOESN'T WANT TO DOSOMETHING, YOU SEND IN THIS
GUY
>> YES.
>> WELL, DON'T TURN AROUND, ITRUINS THE ILLUSION.
AND YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAYIN OR ELSE IT DOESN'T COUNT.
