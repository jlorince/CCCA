( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME!
TO THE "DAILY SHOW."
HOW ARE YOU?
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU
TONIGHT THAT I THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND TOP NOTCH.
OUR GUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT
CHRISTINE AMANPOUR.
OH, CNN CORRESPONDENT.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THEY
RUIN HER.
( LAUGHTER )
SHE'S VERY GOOD.
IT WON'T BE EASY.
BUT THEY'LL TRY.
I HOPE YOU GUYS HAD A GOOD
WEEKEND.
I HAD A VERY NICE WEEKEND.
I SPENT A GOOD TWO MINUTE OF IT
WATCHING THE KENTUCKY DERBY.
( LAUGHTER )
THE REST OF IT I SPENT WATCHING
THE 142nd ANNUAL CONVENTION
OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE
ASSOCIATION HELD THIS YEAR IN
PARK SLOPE BROOK-- OH, NO, I
MEAN-- I'M SORRY, HOUSTON,
TEXAS.
WHERE HIGH-VELOCITY PROJECTILE
LOVERS OF ONE STRIPE CAME
TOGETHER TO RAISE THEIR HANDS IN
THE AIR!
NOT TO PARTY LIKE THEY JUST
DON'T CARE ABOUT HIGH-5 EACH
OTHER WITH THEIR NON-GUN-HOLDING
HANDS.
( LAUGHTER )
IT WAS TO CELEBRATE THE SINGLE
ISSUE-- THE MEMBERS OF THE
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION.
>> THE OBAMA LIBERALS WANT TO
DISREGARD THE 10th AMENDMENT
AND TRYING TO IMPLEMENT
OBAMACARE AND TAKE AWAY OUR
LIBERTY.
>> Jon:  I'M SORRY, GENERAL
PATTON.
I--
( LAUGHTER )
ANYWAY, OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE
REFORM IS DESIGNED TO TAKE YOUR
LIBERTIES.
FOCUSOK GUN AND RIFLE-RELATED
ISSUES SO--
>> WHEREY ARE THEY GOING AFTER
CHAPLAINS IN THE MILITARY SAYING
THEY CAN'T EVANGELIZE AND
PROSELYTIZE?
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  MY GUESS IS THAT
WORD DOES NOT MEAN WHAT IENING
IT MIGHT MINE.
AGAIN, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT.
THE WAR ON CHRISTIANS THERE.
BUT GETTING BACK TO GUNS.
>> WE'RE CREATING JOBS, DAY IN
AND DAY OUT IN THIS STATE.
>> IN BENGHAZI, ON SEPTEMBER THE
11th OF LAST YEAR.
>> THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK NOW
WANTS TO BAN PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF
LEGAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS.
( LAUGHTER )
GLI KNOW HOW UPSET YOU GET,
SARAH PALIN, WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW
YORK AND--
( LAUGHTER )
WALK INTO A BODAIGA AND CAN'T
FIND YOUR PHILLY BLUNTS.
LOOK.
YOU'VE BEEN HERE TWICE, TWICE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
AND ONCE BECAUSE McCAIN MADE
YOU SO N. NEY.
WAIT A MINUTE, ALL THESE
PEOPLE-- THIS IS THE SAME LINEUP
WITH THE SAME LAUNDRY LIST OF
CONSERVATIVE GRIEVANCES THAT WE
SAW AT CPAC A MONTH AND A HALF
ANOTHER JUST WITH BETTER
INTRODUCTIONS.
>>
♪ ♪ ♪
>> YEAH!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELCOME TO TEXAS, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.
>> Jon:  WOW.
IF THAT DUDE DOESN'T HAVE A
C.M.T. SHOW BY TOMORROW, LOCK,
STOCK AND-- UM, UM--
>> LET'S SEE.
I THE THIRD ONE I CAN'T.
SORRY.
OOPS.
>> Jon:  YEAH, OOPS.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, LOCK, STOCK,
AND UM, UM, I FORGOT THE THIRD
ONE, OOPS.
I SWEAR THESE CONSERVATIVE GUYS
ARE LIKE CARNEYS UPON THE
SAUSAGE AND PEPPER TRUCKS AT
STREET FAIRS.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO GE AND
THERE'S THE SAUSAGE AND SANDWICH
GUY, AND THEN GUTO THE UPPER
BROADWAY FESTIVAL AND IT'S THE
SAME SAUSAGE GUY.
AND YOU GO TO THE PUERTO RICO
DAY'S PARADE, AND ST. 58'S, AND
ANY CULTURAL EVENT GUTO YOU WILL
SEE THE SAME SAUSAGE TRUCK.
EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE.
THAT'S A DIFFERENT PARADE.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
>> I BELIEVE YOU CAN GET PEP
WERS THAT AS WELL.
