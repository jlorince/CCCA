MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BIG SHOW TONIGHT, MY GUESTNUMBER 42, NUMBER 42 IS ON
THE PROGRAM, PRESIDENT BILLCLINTON WILL BE JOINING US A
LITTLE BIT LATER.
BUT FIRST, I'VE GOT TO TELLYOU, I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM
LAST NIGHT. REMEMBER THATGUY FROM THE REALITY SHOW,
WHAT WAS THAT SHOW CALLED?
AN EGO MANIAC WITH [BLEEP].
NO, NO, ITS WITH CALLED... YEAH,THAT WAS IT, THAT'S IT.
SO IN MY DREAM THE GUY FROMTHAT SHOW, THE ONE WHO
PUTS HIS NAME ON EVERYTHINGTHE WAY A SIX-YEAR-OLD MIGHT,
THAT GUY ANNOUNCED HE WASENTERING THE REPUBLICAN 2016
RACE FOR PRESIDENT.
SO IN MY INCREDIBLY UNLICKLYDREAM THIS MAN, THEN LIKE
DESCENDED DOWN AN ESCALATORLIKE A GOD GOING FROM
THEATER 12 TO THEATER 7 ATTHE MULTIPLEX.
ANYWAY, IN MY DREAM HE ENDEDUP SAYING A BUNCH OF WEIRD
[BLEEP] ABOUT MEXICANS ANDTHEN I WOKE UP.
I MEAN IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT,THE WHOLE THING.
OH MY GOD!
OH MY GOD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HAIR-LIKE FIBERS COMPLETELYUNNATURAL IN COLOR AND TEXTURE.
IT WAS REAL!
YUP.
IT'S ALL TRUE.
EXCEPT FOR THE STUFF HE SAIDABOUT MEXICANS.
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO SAY, ITWAS INCREDIBLE.
I FEEL HUNGOVER TODAY,BETWEEN THE RAUCOUS JOY OF
THE TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ANDTHE OVERINDULGENCE OF PIZZA
HUT'S NEW UNCIRCUMCISEDPENIS LAZY SUSAN, OR
WHATEVER THEY ARE CALLINGIT.
BUT LOOK, OBVIOUSLY EVERY DAYCAN'T BE NEW YEAR'S EVE SO,
AS EMINEM WOULD SAY, BACK TOREALITY.
>> A GLOBAL TRADE DEAL WITHA COMPLETELY BORING NAME BUT
HUGE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS.
THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.
TPP.
>> Jon: YEAH, UNLESS TPPSTANDS FOR TRUMP
PRESIDENTIAL PROJECT, I'MREALLY NOT THAT INTERESTED,
BUT GO ON.
>> IT'S A TRADE AND FOREIGNINVESTMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN
12 NATIONS THAT MAKE UP 40%OF THE WORLD'S GDP.
>> IT IS THE CENTER PIECE OFPRESIDENT OBAMA'S ECONOMIC
AGENDA.
>> THE TRANSPACIFICPARTNERSHIP WOULD REMOVE
TRADE BARRIERS AND TARIFFSAROUND THE PACIFIC RIM,
POTENTIALLY TAKING UP TOONE-THIRD OF THE WORLD'S
TRADE.
>> THE A.F.L./C.I.O. SAYSTPP DOES NOTHING TO CREATE
JOBS.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT-- THAT'SNOT-- WHAT ABOUT THE JOBS IT
CREATES IN THE PACIFIC RIM?
THE PACIFIC RIM JOBS.
NOW SOME PEOPLE SAY-- SOMEPEOPLE SAY THEY'RE NOT
INTERESTED IN THE PACIFICRIM JOB.
WELL, I SAY, UNTIL YOU HAVEHAD A PACIFIC RIM JOB, UNTIL
YOU HAVE GOTTEN IN THERE ANDDONE A PACIFIC RIM JOB OR
GOTTEN THE SATISFACTION OFGIVING SOMEONE A PACIFIC RIM
JOB, IT IS EASY TO DISMISS APACIFIC RIM JOB.
BUT I STAND HERE TONIGHT,ANNOUNCING LOUDLY TO ANYONE
WHO CAN HEAR ME, I AM ANADVOCATE FOR THE PACIFIC
RIM JOB.
WHY, WHY ARE PEOPLESNICKERING.
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME BRINGOUT THE WRITER OF THAT
STANDARD POLICY STATEMENT,MR. DAN McCOY, DAN, WHAT
JUST HAPPENED HERE?
>> OH, YOUR CONFUSION ISUNDERSTANDABLE.
IT'S ACTUALLY A HIDDENREFERENCE TO THE ORAL
STIMULATION OF AN ANUS.
IT'S A DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, DENNIS, THANKYOU.
WELL, I'M STILL NOTCHANGING MY POSITION.
LET'S GET INTO THIS TRADEDETAIL A LITTLE MOHR REALLY
-- AND LOSE OURSELVES IN THEECONOMIC DETAILS.
>> THE DEAL WOULD IDEALLYLEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ON
TRADE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
>> IT ALSO DEALS WITH LABORSTANDARDS, INVESTMENTS AND
PATENTS AMONG OTHER ISSUES.
>> THIS IS A VERYSIGNIFICANT TRADE DEAL.
THE TRANSPACIFIC NATIONS --
>> Jon: CAN WE COME BACK,I'M SORRY, I'M JUST-- THIS
IS BORING THE [BLEEP] OUT OFME.
I'M GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.
I NEED ME-- I NEED ME SOMEDONALD.
I NEED ME SOME DONALD.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
THIS IS, THIS IS MY EMERGENCYPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
TRUMPINATURER 2016.
ANY TIME I FEEL LIKE THEWORLD IS GETTING ME DOWN OR
BORING ME THERE IS NOTHINGTO LOOK FORWARD TO, I JUST
GIVE MYSELF A LITTLE SLICEOF THIS KICKOFF SPEECH.
>> I'M REALLY RICH.
>> Jon: YEAH!
>> HOW STUPID ARE OURLEADERS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HONESTLY, IT'S BETTERTHAN FREE BASE.
THAT'S WEIRD.
GUESS THERE'S SOMEDISAGREEMENT THERE WITH ME
AND THE AUDIENCEMENT. BUTENOUGH TRUMP, WE HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT THE STUPIDCOMPLICATED TRADE DEAL.
ONE THING YOU CAN BE CERTAINFOR, IF OBAMA IS FOR IT, GOP
IS AGIN IT.
SO LET'S HEAR WHY ALL THIS TRADESTUFF IS WORSE THAN THE
GHOST OF JEFFERY DAHMER EATING LINCOLNS BONES OFF
MARTHA WASHINGTON'S CHINA WHILESQUATTING OVER THE BILL OF
RIGHTS.
>> I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF OURMEMBERS, ESPECIALLY ON OUR SIDE
OF THE AISLE, THEY DON'T TRUSTTHIS ADMINISTRATION.
JOIN THE CLUB, NEITHER DO I.
THAT IS PRECISELY WHY ISUPPORT THIS BILL.
>> TRADE LEGISLATION THAT ISABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR
AMERICAN'S FUTURE.
>> AT THE RISK OF HAVINGSOME OF YOU LITERALLY FAINT,
I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THEPRESIDENT FOR THE WAY HE'S
HANDLING THE TRADE ISSUE.

MITCH McCONELL COMPLIMENTINGTHE PRESIDENT.
HOW DID THE CROWD REACT TO THAT?
I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT'S HOWTHEY REACTEDMENT, I'M
SURPRISED HE WAS TALKING TOA FIELD FULL OF ANIMALS.
NOW WE KNOW REPUBLICANS LOVEFREE TRADE MORE THAN THEY
HATE OBAMA.
TRICKY SITUATION FORDEMOCRATS.
DO THEY RISK ANGERING THEPRESIDENT OR
ENVIRONMENTALISTS ANDORGANIZED LABOR.
WHAT POSITION WILL DEMOCRATSTAKE ON SUPPORTING FAST-TRACK
AUTHORITY FOR THE TPP.
>> WHAT'S THE GOOD OF HAVINGA LITTLE BIT OF TRADE
ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE IF WELOSE MILLIONS OF JOBS
BECAUSE WE PUT THEM ON AFAST TRACK TO ASIA.
>> TRADE ADJUSTMENT ISEQUIVALENT TO AN EXECUTION, BUT
YOU'RE GETTING TO CHOOSE YOURLAST MEAL.
>> I HAVE NEVER, EVER IN MY33 YEARS IN CONGRESS EVER
SUPPORTED, EVER SUPPORTED ATRADE AGREEMENT.
I'M NOT GOING TO START NOW.
THE ANSWER IS NOT ONLY NO,BUT HELL NO, OKAY.
>> Jon: IN FACT, [BLEEP] NO.
I WOULDN'T [BLEEP] THISTRADE AGREEMENT WITH LOUIS
GOMER'S DICK. YEAH, THAT'SRIGHT.
WHO KNEW ALL YOU HAD TO DOWAS FIRE UP HARRY REID, THE
HUMAN EQUIVALENT OF DRYTOAST, WAS MENTION TRADE
AGREEMENTS.
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT, I WHATHAVE MENTIONED IT EARLIER AND
KEPT MYSELF FROM FALL ASLEEPEVERY TIME I INTERVIEWED
HIM.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW TO BE CLEAR.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT THIS ISWHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN
SOMEONE'S GOT FIVE WEEKSLEFT, PEOPLE.
GET USED TO IT.
[BLEEP], I'M OUTTA HERE!
NOW TO BE CLEAR, THE TPP ISNOT WHAT THEY WERE VOTING ON
FRIDAY, THEY WERE VOTING ONTHE TRADE ADJUSTMENT
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AIMED ATHELPING AMERICAN WORKERS
WHOSE JOBS MOVE OVERSEAS.
HISTORICALLY, DEMOCRATS ARE FORIT, BUT THE'RE AGAINST IT IN
ORDER TO KILL THE TRADEPROMOTION AUTHORITY, TPA,
WHICH WOULD'VE FORCED CONGRESSTO VOTE UP OR DOWN ON THE
FINISHED AGREEMENT, THE TPP,WITHOUT THE OPTION OF ADDING
AMENDMENTS.
SO BASICALLY THEY HAVE TOOBSTRUCTIVE TPA, REJECTED THE
TAA TO OBSTRUCT THE TAA, TO DEALTHE BLOW TO  --
YOU KNOW WHAT.
>> I'VE DONE AN AMAZING JOB.
I PROMISE I WILL NEVER BE INA BICYCLE RACE, THAT I CAN TELL
YOU.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD YOU MENTIONTHAT AT YOUR PRESIDENTIAL
KICKOFF.
I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE FORHIM BUT I'M WORRIED HE MIGHT
PUT ON BICYCLE SHORTS, IDON'T KNOW.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, YOU CANDO THIS WITHOUT THE TRUMP
JUICE.
JUST TELL ME IF THE PRESIDENTGOT WHAT HE WANTED OR NOT.
>> THE HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLYREJECTED A WHITE
HOUSE-BACKED BILL DESIGNEDTO PAVE THE WAY FOR A
MASSIVE 12 NATION PACIFICTRADE PACT.
>> Jon: THE WHOLE TPA-TAA-TPP VOTE IS SO FULL OF LEGISLATIVE
MANEUVERING AND ALMOST IDENTICALACRONYMS, IT'S HARD TO GET HOW
UPSIDE DOWN EVERYTHING.
HERE IS HOW SCREWED UPEVERYTHING IS.
>> THE CRAZY THINGS I'MSEEING PUT OUT IN THE MEDIA
BY BIG LABOR, THEWILLINGNESS TO MAKE UP
STORIES, TO MAKE UP FACTS,GOEBBELS WOULD BE VERY PROUD
OF THEM.
TAKE NANCY REAGAN SERIOUSLY.
WHEN IT COMES IT ALL THREEVOTES TODAY, JUST VOTE NO.
>> Jon: HERE'S HOW CRAZY IT IS.
A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN USED ANAZI METAPHOR TO ARGUE IN FAVOR
OF THE PRESIDENT, WHILEDEMOCRATS QUOTE NANCY REAGAN
AGAINST HIM.
COULD THINGS GET WEIRDER?
>> I DEFINITELY AM NOTWHITE.
I DON'T KNOW, NECESSARILY,IF MY SKIN CHRR HAS CHANGED.
DEPENDS ON THE SEASON.
>> I WAS DRAWINGSELF-PORTRAITS WITH THE
BROWN CRAYON INSTEAD OF THEPEACH CRAYON.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S RIGHT,CINDY BRADY STILL THINKS
SHE'S BLACK.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT AIN'T BLOWING MYMIND ANY MORE DEMOCRATIC
REAGAN WORLD.
LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS: OURLEGISLATIVE SITUATION IS
COMPLEX AND WE NEED A LEADERWHO CAN CUT THROUGH THE
BUREAUCRACY AND GET THINGSDONE.
LUCKILY I HAPPEN TO THEY AGUY.
>> I WILL BE THE GREATESTJOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER
CREATED.
>> Jon: IN FACT, I DON'TKNOW WHY GOD TOOK SO LONG TO
CREATE ME.
