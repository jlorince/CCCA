MANY OF YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS.

ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, JUST 12 MONTHS AGO PARENTS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY SUDDENLY EXPLAINED TO THEIR CHILDREN WHY THEY JUST SHOUTED AT THE TV.

THIS AD TOUTING OBAMA'S PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP DURING THE RACE WHILE SUBTLY
QUESTIONING HIS OPPONENT'S JUDGMENT.
THAT AD IS --
>> THIS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ABOVE POLITICAL SIZING ANY ISSUE
FOR PERSONAL GAIN, POLITICIZING WHAT -- AN EVENT THAT ALL AMERICANS AM LAWED ENORMOUSLY,
IT IS DEPLORABLE TO POLITICIZE THIS.

THIS, WE SHOULDN'T GLOAT ABOUT IT.
>> RUNNING CAMPAIGN ADS GLOATING ABOUT IT.

REPUBLICANS, YOU ARE ANNOYED BY THE ARROGANCE AND BRAGGADOCIO OF A WARTIME PRESIDENT POLITICAL
HAT, YOU THINK HE IS DIVISIVELY AND UNFAIRLY BELITTLING HIS OPPONENT.
I SEE.
HAVE A QUESTION.
ARE YOU ON CRACK?  WERE YOU ALIVE LO THESE PAST TEN YEARS?  IT SEEMS UNSEEMLY FOR THE
PRESIDENT TO SPIKE THE FOOTBALL.
BUSH LANDED ON A (BLEEP) AIRCRAFT CARRIER WITH A FOOTBALL STUFFED PIECE, HE SPIKED THE
FOOTBALL BEFORE THE GAME HAD EVEN STARTED!
>> YET YOUR REPUBLICAN OUTRAGE --
[ APPLAUSE ]

>> HE WOULD NOT ONLY BE IN BAGHDAD, BUT KUWAIT.
>> OH, MY GOSH.
>> BLURRY ED GILLESPIE IS DIVISIVE AND PARTISAN.
>> BY THE WAY, BLURRY GILLESPIE ALSO THE NAME OF A LESS THAN HERALDED TRUMPET PLAYER.
>> NOBODY EVER BOOKED BLURRY,
JUST DIZZY.
>> THERE IS MORE.
>> THE ATTACK ROM ROM WOULDN'T HAVE DONE.
>> YOU SEE IN THE BUSH AD SAYING, YOU KNOW, HE IS A STRONG
LEADER, YOU DON'T SEE HIM SAYING AND THAT GUY, YOU KNOW, WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
>> YEAH, YEAH, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE USED HIM TO PROJECT HOW A HYPOTHETICAL PRESIDENT ROMNEY
WOULD ACT.
AND IT IS SO DEVIOUS OF DEMOCRATS TO STEAL THAT TACTIC.
>> THE CEREBRAL CORTEX, BACK FAKE.
>> NOW WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE TERRORISTS ARE A.
>> HOW CAN ROMNEY PROTECT US WHEN HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE THREAT.
