COMEDY CENTRAL WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
THANK YOU.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT BRAD PAISLEY.
HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK, AN ODE, A LOVE LETTER, IF YOU WILL, TO THE GUITAR WHICH AS
YOU KNOW IN NEW YORK IS LEGAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NOW ITS OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT, A VISCERAL EXPRESSION OF FRUSTRATION
WITH OUR SYSTEM'S INSTITUTIONALIZED ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND IT RESONATES
WITH MANY, MANY PEOPLE.
WITH JUST ONE SMALL CAVEAT.
THIS TURNS INTO THROWING TRASH BUCKS INTO STARBUCKS WINDOWS, NOBODY'S GOING TO
BE DOWN WITH THAT.
WE ALL LOVE STARBUCKS.
HOW DO YOU NOT LOVE STAR KBUX, COFFEE, ADULT CONTEMPORARY MUSIC, FREE I WOULD FEW, IT IS WHAT MANY
OF US BELIEVE HEAVEN TO BE.
(LAUGHTER) SO WHAT IS HAPPENING.
>> THERE WERE ALSO BRIEF FLASHES OF VIOLENCE AS PROTESTORS DAMAGED AND
DEFACED A WHOLE FOODS STORE.
>> Jon: NO, NO!
NO DAMAGE!
(LAUGHTER) NO DAMAGE, BAD OCCUPIERS.
THE STARBUCKS WAS JUST A METAPHOR FOR GENERAL VANDALISM, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
ALL RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS,
NO.
EVEN MOM AND POP STORES, NO.
>> IN FRONT OF A MEN'S WEARHOUSE.
YOU CAN SEE THIS SMASHED WINDOW.
>> OKAY, I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THAT STORE, BUT STILL!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NO MEN'S WEARHOUSE VANDALISM, NO BOWLING BALL INTO A TRADER JOE'S.
DO WE HAVE TO GET THIS SPECIFIC?
NO DUANE READE FLAMING BAGS OF POOP.
NO THROWING A ROLL OF PENNIES THROUGH THE WINDOW OF A 99 CENT STORE, ALTHOUGH
IT WOULD BE VERY CLEVER.
THAT WOULD BE CLEVER.
BUT DON'T DO IT!
EVEN THOUGH THAT STORE WOULD PROBABLY END UP MAKING MONEY,
I KNOW, I KNOW IT'S NOT ALL OF YOU.
IT IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE, A SMALL NUMBER OF YOU BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE JUDGED BY
YOUR WORST ELEMENTS.
AND IT'S VERY TOUGH TO WRANGLE A LEADERLESS MOVEMENT.
SO MAY I SUGGEST THE METHOD THAT WORKS BEST ON ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
PEER PRESSURE.
THE ONLY REASON I STARTED SMOKING IN HIGH SCHOOL.
AND SUBSEQUENTLY-- WHETHER THE BUILT A DRAG RACE CAR.
WE WILL RIDE AGAIN, OLD
