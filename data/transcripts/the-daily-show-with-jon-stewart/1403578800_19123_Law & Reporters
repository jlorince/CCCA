[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
YOU KNOW, LET ME EXPLAIN THISVERY QUICKLY.
IRAQ IS NOT OUR ONLY PAL IN THEMIDDLE EAST THERE.
WE GOT OUR OLD FRIENDTHERE EGYPT.
YEAH.
HOW THEY DOING THESE DAYS?
>> THREE JOURNALISTS FROMAL-JAZEERA HAVE BEEN SENTENCED
TO SEVEN YEARS IN AN EGYPTIANPRISON.
>> FOUND GUILTY ON CHARGESINCLUDING HELPING A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION BY PUBLISHING LIES.
>> Jon: YES.
THANK YOU, GENERAL EL-SISI.
I'M SORRY, PRESIDENT EL-SISI,FINALLY BRINGING THE HAMMER DOWN
ON TERROR JOURNALISTS.
[LAUGHTER]I'M SURE THEY RECEIVED A FAIR
TRIAL IN THE GENERAL'S COURT.
[PEOPLE'S COURT THEME MUSICPLAYING]
NOTHING SAYS INNOCENT UNTILPROVEN GUILTY LIKE KEEPING THE
DEFENDANTS IN CAGE AND HAVINGTHE JUDGE WEAR SUNGLASSES SO YOU
CAN'T SEE HIS EYES.
JUSTICE ISN'T BLIND, BUT IT HASMACULAR DEGENERATION IN ITS
FAMILY. NEEDS TO PROTECT ITSEYES. I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.
BUT, LET'S GET TO THE TRIALITSELF. BECAUSE ALL THREE OF
THESE MEN, BAHER MOHAMED,MOHAMED FAHMY, A
CANADIAN EGYPTIAN, AND PETERGRESTE, AN AUSTRALIAN, ARE
RESPECTED INTERNATIONALJOURNALISTS, SO PROSECUTORS
MUST HAVE BROUGHT A CASETIGHTER THAN KING AKHENATEN'S
SARCOPHAGUS.[LAUGHTER]
"WHOSE SARCOPHAGUS IS FAMOUSFOR ITS TIGHTNESS."
SO WHAT IS THE TERROR EVIDENCE?OR TERROR-VIDENCE?
>> THE ONLY EVIDENCE, IF YOUWANT TO CALL IT THAT, THAT THE
PROSECUTION HAS PRESENTED HASBEEN OLD VIDEO CLIPS, VIDEO
CLIPS OF NEWS CONFERENCES, NEWSREPORTS, SOMETIMES NEWS REPORTS
FROM OUTSIDE OF EGYPT.
>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OFWHAT THE EVIDENCE THEY PRESENTED
WAS.
ONE OF THEM WAS FOOTAGE OF ATROTTING HORSE THAT WAS AIRED BY
SKY NEWS ARABIA.[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WAS IT ANY HORSE ORWAS IT LEGENDARY HORSE TERRORIST
ABU MISTER ED? WHO IBELIEVE TESTIFIED.
>> THEY AGITATED IN MYNEIGH-BORHOOD. THEY'RE GUILTY.
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA.
>> I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IT WASOF COURSE OF COURSE.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THISTRIAL WAS A SHAM.
A SHAM SO SHAM-Y EGYPT'SPROSECUTION COULDN'T BE
BOTHERED TO EVEN PRETEND ITWASN'T A SHAM.
THEIR CASE IS BASED ON SOMERANDOM VIDEO CLIP THEY PROBABLY
FOUND ON THE WEB.
"WE GOT TO JAIL THESETERRORISTS AND HERE'S A HORSE
AND A DOG IN A BALLERINA SUIT.
WE'LL THROW IN A BABY DANCING.
AND THE PROSECUTION RESTS."
COME ON EGYPT, YOUREVIDENCE HAS TO BE MORE
COMPELLING THAN THIS.
>> THE PROSECUTION CLAIMED THEYHAD MORE VIDEO EVIDENCE, BUT
THEY ALSO CLAIMED THAT THEYDIDN'T HAVE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT
TO SHOW IT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE,
BUT IT'S ON BLU-RAY.
NOW WE COULD WAIT FOR THE GUY TOSHOW UP WITH THE HDMI CABLE, OR
I COULD JUST PUT YOU IN[BLEEPED] JAIL FOR SEVEN YEARS.
YOU DON'T HAVE A GENIUS BAR,GEEK SQUAD, SHEIK SQUAD?
THAT WOULD WORK.
THAT'S THE THING.
EVEN MORE THAN THE CORRUPTION OFTHIS TRIAL, WHAT BOTHERS ME IS
THE LAZINESS.
AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TOFORGE SOME EVIDENCE.
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
LOOK.
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S THE REPORTS HAVE ANUNDERWATER TERRORIST CONFERENCE
WITH BIN LADEN AND DR. DOOM.
THAT WOULD BE MORE CONVINCINGTHAN THE EVIDENCE THE EGYPTIAN
COURT JUST CONVICTED THESE MENON. AND, BY THE WAY,
DON'T THINK WHEN THE PEOPLEFINALLY RISE UP AGAINST
EL-SISI, THEY WON'T FOLLOW THESAME STRICT RULES OF EVIDENCE.
>> HE'S A DICTATOR.I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU NEED
A HORSE TELL YOU THIS.[NEIGHING]
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
