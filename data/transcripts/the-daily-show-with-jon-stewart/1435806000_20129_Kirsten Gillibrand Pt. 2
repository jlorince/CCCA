>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR KIRSTENGILLIBRAND WHO JUST CURSED OUT
TOM COTTON.
I WAS JUST --  LISTEN, I HAVEBEEN AROUND THE BLOCK.
I WAS IN THE NAVY FOR EIGHTYEARS.
I WORKED AS A DOCK WORKER.
YOUR LANGUAGE SHOCKED ME.
I WAS STUNNED.
AND I WOULD ASK YOU-- I HAVECHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
I WOULD ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROMTHAT KIND OF SALTY TALK.
>> OF COURSE.
>> Jon: WHEN IS THE VOTE FORTHIS BILL?
>> WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE ITRIGHT AROUND SEPTEMBER 11th.
SO IF YOU WANT TO DOSOMETHING, CALL YOUR
CONGRESS MEMBER-- PLEASECALL THEM.
FRACKLY, THE ONLY TIMEANYTHING EVER WORKS IN
WASHINGTON IS WHEN REGULARPEOPLE STAND UP AND DEMAND
ACTION.
SO YOUR VOICE MATTERS.
PLEASE BE HEARD ON THISISSUE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: LET'S, LET'S DO THAT -- LET'S SCHEDULE A
CALL AND LET'S SCHEDULE ARITUAL SHAMING AROUND THAT
TIME.
FOR WHOEVER IT IS.
I OBVIOUSLY, AT THAT POINT,WILL BE KNEE-DEEP IN MORE
THAN LIKELY GRAIN ALCOHOL.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE NEXT THINGCLOSE TO YOUR HEART THAT YOU
WANT TO GET DONE?
WAS'S NEXT?
>> WELL, I'M WORKING HARD ONALSO ENDING CAMPUS SEXUAL
ASSAULT AND I'M WORKING HARDON ACTUALLY PASSING A PAID
LEAVE PROGRAM FOR THE ENTIREUNITED STATES FOR ALL WORKER
TO MAKE SURE FAMILY MEMBERSWHO NEED CARE --
>> Jon: WHAT'S THE OTHERINDUSTRIALIZSED NATION THAT
DOESN'T DO THAT.
>> IT IS US AND PAPUA NEWGUINEA.
THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRYIN THE WORLD THAT DOESN'T HAVE
PAID LEAVE.
AND SO WHETHER YOU HAVE ASPOUSE THAT IS ILL, OR A
PARENT THAT IS DYING OR ANEW CHILD.
FAMILIES NEED FLEXIBILITY SOYOU DON'T HAVE TO QUIT YOUR
JOB.
THAT YOU CAN STAY ON COURSEAND NOT LOSE THAT PLACE IN
YOUR BUSINESS.
>> Jon: WHERE DID WE LOSETHE THREAD, IS OUR
GOVERNMENT JUST TOO BIG TOMANAGE NOW?
IS THAT THE PROBLEM?
JUST EVERYTHING JUST SLIPSUNDER THE THING, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
>> THE ISSUE IS, PEOPLE INCONGRESS ARE IN A BUBBLE.
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OFEMPATHY FOR REGULAR WORKING
FAMILIES.
>> Jon: AT A CERTAIN POINT YOUJUST THINK, ARE THEY LIKE
RAPACIOUS SOCIAL DARWINNIANCARICATURES OF VILLAINS?
ARE THEY DICKENSIAN SCROOGES?
I DON'T MIND PEOPLEBEING RESPONSIBLE WITH TAXPAYER
MONEY.
THAT IS IMPORTANT, TO MANAGEEFFICIENCIES, BUT THIS IDEA OF
FOOD STAMPS, YOU KNOW, THENEVERYBODY IS JUST GOING TO GO
OUT AND BUY SHRIMP AND SITAROUND AND DRINK MAITAIES.
>> YES, IT'S A LACK OFEMPATHY.
AND MOST MEMBERS MUCHCONGRESS DON'T EVEN REALIZE
IF YOU ARE ON THE MINIMUMWAGE YOU ARE UNDER THE
POVERTY LINE.
>> Jon: IS IT PATHOLOGICAL,THOUGH?
DO YOU NEW THEY HAVE MENTALPROBLEMS?
>> NO, I THINK THEY ARE OUT OFTOUCH.
I THINK MOST MEMBERS ARE OUTOF TOUCH AND DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR REGULARWORKING AMERICANS.
>> Jon: IS IT CYNICAL ORMANIPULATING A GRIEVANCE
INDUSTRY AMONGST VOTERS, THATPLAY INTO THAT AS THE VOTERS
AS VICTIMS OF THISENTITLEMENT CULTURE?
OR DO THEY TRULY BELIEVE IT?
OR IS IT A MORE CYNICALEXERCISE IN POLITICS.
>> I THINK IT'S CYNICISM,PERSONALLY.
AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE PAIDLEAVE ISSUE, MOST MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS ARE EXTREMELYAFFLUENT.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT ISLIKE TO NOT HAVE ANY CHILD
CARE AT HOME OR TO NOT BEABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF IN
SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY IS ILL.
THEY'VE NEVER LIVED IT.
>> Jon: THEY EARNED ON THEIROWN, ONLY THEY HAVE EARNED
IT.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICKYOURSELF UP OUT OF POVERTY
AND DESPAIR AND THEN YOU CANBE IN THE SENATE, AND IF I
GIVE YOU FOOD STAMPS THAT ISGOING TO SEND A VERY BAD
MESSAGE TO YOU THAT YOU GETTO EAT.
AND THAT'S-- YOU KNOW --
>> YEAH, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO TELL YOU.
IT IS CRAZY OUTRAGEOUS.
DO YOU EVER-- YOU DON'T HAVETO ANSWER THIS.
DO YOU EVER PUNCH ANYBODY?
LIKE WITH YOU'RE JUST INTHEIR OFFICE AND JUST BE
LIKE OH, I'M SO SORRY, IHAVE TO DECK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, NO.
>> Jon: OKAY.
SENATOR, IT'S ALWAYS APLEASURE.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: GET THAT 9/11BILL-PASSED.
KRISTEN GILLIBRAND.
