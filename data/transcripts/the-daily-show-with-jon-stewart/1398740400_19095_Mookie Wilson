>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A NEW YORK METSLEGEND.
IS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "MOOKIE:  LIFE, BASEBALL AND THE 86 METS."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMMOOKIE WILSON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]MOOKIE WILSON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]AN HONOR TO SEE YOU HERE.
>> GREAT.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: REALLY THE LAST TIMEIN MANY YEARS THAT I CAN
ACTUALLY SAY THAT TO A NEW YORKMET.
>> ROUGH TIMES HUH?
>> Jon: IT'S BEEN SOMEROUGH TIMES.
THIS REALLY WAS.
YOU KNOW, YOU WRITE ABOUT 1986.
THERE IS SOMETHING TRULYINDELIBLE ABOUT A CHAMPIONSHIP
SEASON THAT MAKES IT WORTHY OFREMEMBRANCE.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE 86 TEAMWHEN YOU GUYS WON THE WORLD
SERIES? BESIDES THEDRAMATIC FASHION?
>> I THINK IT'S THE CHARACTERS.
I THINK WE WERE A GROUP OFINDIVIDUALS THAT WASN'T AFRAID
TO BE THEMSELVES.
I THINK YOU NEED MORE OF THAT INSPORTS.
>> Jon: MORE OF THAT?
>> YES.
>> Jon: BUT YOU WERE, YOUKNOW, THE 86 TEAM HAD
DOC GOODEN, DARYL STRAWBERRY.KEITH HERNANDEZ.
>> YES.
>> Jon: BUT, YOU WERE A BEACONOF MATURITY IN THAT.
>> OOOH, THAT'S GOOD.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU THINK?
YOU WERE THE ONE GUY EVERYBODYLOVED AND NOBODY EVER WORRIED
ABOUT.
YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT KEITHHERNANDEZ AT SOME POINT, 6:00 IN
THE MORNING SOMEBODY IS GOING TOBE LIKE WHERE IS KEITH?
MOOKIE WILSON NEVER HAD THATISSUE.
>> I THINK THE TEAM -- WE HADTHIS GROUP OVER HERE THAT WAS
REALLY OUTGOING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLED THEM THESCUM BUNCH. YOU KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]THEN YOU HAD THIS OTHER GROUP
OVER HERE THAT WAS REALLY,YOU KNOW, GARY CARTERS,
RON DARLING AND THEN YOU HADTHOSE GUYS IN THE MIDDLE LIKE
MYSELF AND RAFAEL SANTANA THATKINDA KEPT IT ALL TOGETHER.
>> Jon: AND THAT CHEMISTRY?
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND IT BRINGSUP THIS KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUTTHIS DONALD STERLING, THIS
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A RACISTOWNER, SPORTS REALLY IS AN
UNUSUALLY ALMOST PATERNALSITUATION WITH THE OWNER.
THEY CAN SHIP YOU OUT TO ANOTHERCITY.
DO THE PLAYERS FEEL THATRELATIONSHIP?
>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOINGTO BE THAT WEIRD RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN PLAYERS, YOU KNOW, ANDMANAGEMENT KNOWING THAT
MANAGEMENT DOES HAVE THE LASTWORD.
IT SOMETIMES DOESN'T MATTER HOWWELL YOU PLAY. IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEPLAYER AND OWNERSHIP.
NOW, THIS BASKETBALL SITUATIONIS A REALLY, REALLY DIFFERENT
WHEEL. A LOT OF RACIST REMARKSAND HERE HE OWNS A TEAM
THAT IS WHAT 80% BLACK?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.
>> Jon: THAT IS WEIRD. BUT,YOU FIND IN THESE LEAGUES THE
OWNER IS TYPICALLY WHITE.THE ATHLETES, TYPICALLY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN. THEATHLETES WHO
ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAD TOFIGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO PLAY
AND EVEN NOW STILL HAVE TO FIGHTFOR RIGHTS. THIS IDEA THAT, OK,
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALLOWED TOLEAVE AT SEVEN YEARS BUT YOU
HAVE TO PUT IN THIS AMOUNT OFTIME.
DO YOU THINK IS COULD BE ATURNING POINT IN THAT
RELATIONSHIP?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
I THINK SPORTS HAS SURVIVED. IMEAN,
OVER THE YEARS AS MUCH AS WE'VETRIED TO MESS BASEBALL UP, WE
HAVEN'T WITH STRIKES AND ALLTHAT.
THE GAME WILL SURVIVE. I THINK,
YOU CAN MAKE ALL THE RULES YOUWANT TO BUT UNTIL YOU CHANGE THE
ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE, YOU AREGOING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF
IDIOCY NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.IT'S JUST GOING TO HAPPEN.
>>Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. AS APLAYER, HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT
KIND OF, I MEAN, THESE GUY GUYSARE IN THE MIDST OF A
PLAYOFF RUN. NOW, YOU PLAYEDIN NEW YORK.
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OFDISTRACTION.
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MEDIA.
THEY ARE THIS THE SAME IN LOSANGELES.
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR AN ATHLETE ATTHAT HIGH LEVEL TO STILL COMPETE
WITH THIS TYPE OF EMOTION UNDERTHE SURFACE?
>> WELL, FIRST ANDFOREMOST IS ATHLETES DEAL
WITH PRESSURE. EVERY DAY THEYGO ON THE FIELD IT'S
ALL ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THAT DAY.
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT.
THEY ARE NOT PLAYING FOR THEOWNER. THEY ARE PLAYING FOR
THEIR OWN SELF RESPECT.AND YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD THINGS
ABOUT OH SHOULD THETEAM BOYCOTT AND NOT PLAY.
THAT SERVES NO REAL PURPOSE. IMEAN, IT WOULD DEFEAT THE
PURPOSE OF YOU BEING THERE,PLAYING BASKETBALL AT THE NBA
LEVEL THAT'S A GREAT, GREATHONOR AND TO LET SOME IDIOT NOT
LET YOU FULFILL THE POTENTIALTHAT YOUR TEAM HAS I THINK YOU
WOULD BE DOING YOURSELF ADISSERVICE AND THE LEAGUEITSELF.
>> Jon: SEE WHAT I MEANABOUT YOU HAVING THE MATURITY?
LOOK AT ME.
I'M READY TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE,JUST WALK AWAY FROM THE GAME AND
YOU BROUGHT ME BACK.
HERE IS WHAT I THINK SHOULDHAPPEN.
>> YES. OKAY.
>> Jon: THE CLIPPERS RALLYAROUND THIS, THEY PLAY
UNBELIEVABLE BASKETBALL FOR THENEXT MONTH.
THEY WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND IN THE LOCKER ROOMIN THE JUBILATION THE TROPHY IS
HANDED TO THEM.
DONALD STERLING IS RIGHT THEREAND THEY GET THE TALLEST GUY.
LET'S GO WITH BLAKE GRIFFIN,HE'S ABOUT 6'11''.
AND HE JUST HOLDS THE TROPHY UPLIKE THIS
AND DONALD STERLING IS -- HE HASTHIS -- CAN'T GET IT. AND DONE.
THEY DON'T LET HIM HAVE IT.
[LAUGHTER]DO YOU STILL, ARE YOU STILL ABLE
TO GET TOGETHER WITH SOME OFFELLAS AND REMINISCE ABOUT IT?
YOU KNOW, TRAGICALLY GARY CARTEROF COURSE PASSED AWAY.
GREAT CHARACTER GUY. AREYOU ABLE TO GET TOGETHER
AND SORT OF REVERT BACKTO FORM FROM THE 80s AND HAVE A
GREAT TIME TOGETHER?
>> WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.
WE DO GET TOGETHER AND WHEN WEDO IT'S ONE BIG REUNION.
WE TALK A LOT AND WE LIE ALITTLE BIT, TOO.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHATREMINISCING IS ALL ABOUT.
>> THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
>> Jon: AND WHO WOULD HAVETHOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE LAST
CHAMPIONSHIP THE METS EVER WON.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO SEE
YOU AND TO HAVE YOU HERE ON THESHOW.
GET YOURSELF "MOOKIE."
ONE OF THE GREATS.
MOOKIE WILSON, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
