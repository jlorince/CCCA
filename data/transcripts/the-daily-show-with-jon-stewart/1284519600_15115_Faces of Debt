>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OUR GUEST TONIGHT OH, WE'VE GOT
A NICE GUEST TONIGHT.
FORMER ENGLAND PRIME MINISTER
TONY BLAIR IS HERE.
S HIS SECOND TIME ON OUR
PROGRAM.
THE FIRST TIME SINCE WINNING
SIMON COLIN POWELL'S X FACTOR.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT FIRST LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO
REFLECT ON WHAT A CHALLENGING
SUMMER THIS HAS BEEN FOR
AMERICANS.
FIRST:  BED BUGS AND THEN
MMMMUSLIMS.
AND FINALLY MMMUSLIM BED BUGS.
THE MOST DANGEROUS BED BUG OF
ALL.
YOU KNOW THEY ARE MUSLIM BECAUSE
ALL YOUR BITE MARKS FACE MECCA.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE WAS A BRIGHT SIDE.
THIS SUMMER PROMISED TO BRING AN
END TO AMERICA'S ECONOMIC WOES.
>> THE TRUTH IS NOW WE'RE
SPENDING MORE NOW THIS SUMMER.
I'M CALLING THIS THE SUMMER OF
RECOVERY.
>> Jon: THE SUMMER OF
RECOVERY!
THAT'S WHAT BRIAN WILSON WANTED
TO CALL EVERY BEACH BOYS ALBUM.
[LAUGHTER]
THE SUMMER OF RECOVERY.
SO HOW DID THAT WORK OUT FOR US?
>> SALES OF NEW HOMES FELL TO AN
ALL-TIME RECORD LOW IN JULY.
>> EVERY DAY NEW DISMAL ECONOMIC
NUMBERS.
>> 54,000 JOBS DISAPPEARED.
>> 14.9 MILLION UNEMPLOYED.
>> AUTOMOTIVE NUMBERS DISMAL.
>> STOCKS ENTERED A LOW ON
MONDAY IN THE WORST PERFORMANCE
THAT MONTH SINCE 2001.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I DON'T LIKE THIS
SUMMER!
SO THE SUMMER OF RECOVERY
SLIDING INTO THE AUTUMN OF
NOTHING BUT RAMEN NOODLES FOR
DINNER.
IT'S THE MEAL YOU CAN KNIT WITH.
[LAUGHTER]
COULD -- COULD THE
ADMINISTRATION HAVE COME UP WITH
A MORE ILL CONCEIVED NAME FOR
THIS SUMMER?
I GUESS IT WASN'T AS BAD AS
BIDEN ANNOUNCEMENT LAST YEAR OF
THE UPCOMING SUMMER OF
REASONABLE HEALTH CARE REFORM
DISCUSSION.
>> WAIT A MINUTE.
>> Jon: REMEMBER THAT?
Y'ALL ARE IN TROUBLE!
THIS ECONOMY IS ON THE EMPTY
POCKETS EXPRESS TO HOBO
JUNCTION.
WE'VE GOT TO TURN THIS BUS
AROUND.
>> MR. OBAMA ANNOUNCED AUSTAN
GOOLSBEE WILL TAKE OVER AS THE
CHAIRMAN OF COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC
ADVISERS.
>> Jon: OR JUST SWITCH
DRIVERS.
GOOLSBEE, HE'S THE NEW SCAREMAN
ON THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC
ADVISERS.
ALL RIGHT, GOOLSBEE, YOU ARE THE
NEW FACE OF THE OBAMA SUMMER OF
RECOVERY.
SPIN US WITH SOME HAPPY TALK?
>> THIS RECESSION IS THE DEEPEST
IN OUR LIFETIME.
I DON'T THINK THE UNEMPLOYMENT
LATE BE COMING DOWN
SIGNIFICANTLY ANY TIME IN THE
NEAR FUTURE.
I DON'T EXPECT IT TO GO DOWN
APPRECIABLY.
THE LABOR MARKET IS
SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED HAS BEEN
FOR SOME TIME.
>> Jon: SORRY I WAS JUST
MAKING MY RAMEN NOODLE NOOSE.
[LAUGHTER]
(bleep) GOOLSBEE!
I WAS KIDDING ABOUT THE CRYPT
KEEPER REFERENCE BUT COME ON.
DID ANYONE CHECK WITH YOU BEFORE
BIDEN CALLED THIS THE SUMMER OF
RECOVERY?
WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?
>> THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS
TALKING ABOUT THE SUMMER OF
RECOVERY IN REFERENCE TO THE
RECOVERY ACT THAT YOU WOULD SEE
THE CREATION OF A SERIES OF
INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER
PROJECTS RAMPING UP OVER THE
SUMMER AND DID YOU SEE THAT.
>> Jon: YES, BUT HE DIDN'T
CALL IT THAT.
HE CALLED THE -- IT THE SUMMER
OF RECOVERY.
LET'S SAY IN JUNE I ANNOUNCE TO
THE NATION THIS IS THE SUMMER OF
LOSING MY VIRGINITY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEN IN SEPTEMBER I, STILL A
VIRGIN, AM ASKED DIDN'T YOU SAY
THIS WAS THE SUMMER OF LOSING
YOUR VIRGINITY AT WHICH POINT I
SAY I WAS SAYING THE SUMMER IN
THE SPIRIT OF LOSEN MY VIRGINITY
ONLY TO FIND OUT AT THE END OF
CAMP THAT GIRLS LIKE JERKS
INSTEAD OF ROMANCE.
NO WAY CAMP STAR TAKES JOCK IN
FINAL JAM NO.
WAY SN.
CAMP ROCK TWO?
CAMP ROCK 2 THE FINAL JAM?
ANYBODY.
CAN'T GET MY KIDS INTERESTED IN
IT EITHER.
LA OF LAUGH --
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE THAT'S UNFAIR.
THE ECONOMY IS THE SUM TOTAL OF
A LOT OF COMPLEX MOVING PARTS
NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THE
FATE OF BUSH ERA TAX CUTS SET TO
EXPIRE AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT
>> THE PRESIDENT EA VIEWPOINT IS
PROTECT THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX
CUTS AND LET THOSE FOR THE
WEALTHY EXPIRE.
>> Jon: LET THEM EXPIRE FOR
THE WEALTHY JUST LIKE THE FOOD
IN THEIR FANCY REFRIGERATORS.
[LAUGHTER]
IT GOES BAD BEFORE THEY EAT IT
BECAUSE THEY BUY SO MUCH EVEN
THEIR FANCY BUTLERS CAN'T EAT IT
ALL.
OF COURSE, REPUBLICANS BEING THE
PARTIVE INCLUSION -- PARTY OF
INCLUSION --
[LAUGHTER]
-- WOW, THAT WAS WEIRD.
I JUST THREW UP?
MY MOUTH.
-- I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH.
THE REPUBLICANS, BEING THE PARTY
OF INCLUSION R LOOKING OUT FOR
EVERYBODY.
>> WE NEED TO EXTEND ALL THE TAX
CUTS.
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO RAISE
TAXES.
>> Jon: I'M WAITING FOR THE
DAY ANYBODY EVER SAYS NOW IS THE
TIME RAISE TAXES.
I THINK WE'RE WAITING A LINE.
THE LINE IS DRAWN.
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT NO WAY,
NO HOW WOULD YOU VOTE FOR
CONTINUING THE TAX CUTS FOR THE
FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE CLASS UNLESS
IT ALSO INCLUDES THE TAX CUTS
FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE UPPER
BRACKETS?
>> IF THE ONLY OPTION I HAVE IS
TO VOTE FOR THOSE AT $250,000
AND BELOW, OF COURSE I'M GOING
TO DO THAT.
>> Jon: WHAT?
MY GOD THE SEEDS OF COMPROMISE.
IS THAT THIS WHAT THE
ADMINISTRATION -- NE, THE
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR.
WE THE PEOPLE.
BOEHNER IS THE BOEHNER WE'VE
BEEN BEANING FOR.
PERHAPS THIS BREAK IN REPUBLICAN
ORTHODOXCY IS THE OLIVE BRANCH
THAT WILL TURN THE TIDE.
>> TKPW *EUBDZ PRODUCED THE
REPUBLICANS TAKING TO TWITTER TO
SAY THEY WERE IN DISARRAY.
WHY OLD MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS
HOSTAGE.
BOEHNER TWEETED BACK REPUBLICANS
ARE UNIFIED AND CAN'TER AND
OTHER REPUBLICANS RETWEETED WHAT
BOEHNER WROTE.
>> Jon: AND ONE OF OUR MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUES DEVOLVES INTO
TWITTER.
BOEHNER RESPONDS AT PRESS SEC
WE'RE UNIFIED SOX GIBBS TWITS
BACK AT BOEHNER YOU ARE SO
ORANGE YOU FART CHEATO DUST AND
BOEHNER GOES, AT PRESS SEC THE
ETRADE BABY CALLED HE WANTS HIS
