[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]NICE TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME.
>> Jon: IT'S AN HONOR FOR US.
I KNOW ME.
THIS IS -- BY THE WAY, WE TALKEDA LITTLE BIT BEFORE THE SHOW.
NOTHING FEELS BETTER THAN MAKINGYOU LAUGH.
I WILL SAY THAT.
I ENJOYED THAT VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: I AM MALALA.
IT'S HONESTLY HUMBLING TO MEETYOU.
YOU ARE 16.
WHERE DID YOUR LOVE FOREDUCATION COME FROM?
>> WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THISIS THE PART OF OUR HUMAN NATURE
THAT WE DON'T LEARN THEIMPORTANCE OF ANYTHING UNTIL
IT'S SNATCHED FROM OUR HANDS.
AND WHEN -- IN PAKISTAN WHEN WEWERE STOPPED FROM GOING TO
SCHOOL AT THAT TIME I REALIZEDTHAT EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT
AND EDUCATION IS A POWER FORWOMEN.
AND THAT'S WHY THE TERRORISTSARE AFRAID OF EDUCATION.
THEY DON'T WANT WOMEN TO GETEDUCATION BECAUSE WOMEN WILL
BECOME MORE POWERFUL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: EXACTLY RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WHEN DID THE -- WHEN DID THE
TALIBAN COME TO SWAT VALLEY?
BECAUSE BEFORE THEN YOU DESCRIBEIT AS A PARADISE OF SORTS.
>> A TALIBAN CAME IN 2004 BUT ATTHAT TIME THEY WERE QUITE GOOD.
THEY DID NOT SHOW THE TERRORISMAND THEY DID NOT BLAST ANY
SCHOOL AT THAT TIME.
THEY STARTED WITH THE REALTERRORISM IN 2007 THEY
BLASTED MORE THAN 400 SCHOOLS INSWAT.
THEY SLAUGHTERED PEOPLE AND INTHE MONTH OF JANUARY 2009, THEY
USED TO SLAUGHTER EVEN TWO THREEPEOPLE EVERY NIGHT AND THEY
FLOGGED THEM AND WE HAVE SEENTHE BARBARIC SITUATION OF THE
21ST CENTURY.
AND WE'VE SEEN LIKE THE CRUELTYAND WE'VE SEEN HARSH DAYS IN OUR
LIFE.
AND THOSE ARE REGARDED AS THEDARKEST DAYS OF OUR LIFE.
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR US ATTHAT TIME.
>> Jon: YOU DESCRIBE IN THEBOOK STILL, NO MATTER WHAT, THEY
TOOK THE SIGNS OFF THE SCHOOLS.
THEY  WENT UNDERGROUND BUT THEYCONTINUED IN THE FACE OF -- YOU
SPOKE OUT PUBLICLY AGAINST THETALIBAN.
WHAT GAVE YOU THE COURAGE TOCONTINUE THIS?
>> YOU KNOW, MY FATHER WAS AGREAT ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ME
BECAUSE HE SPOKE OUT FOR WOMENS'RIGHTS, FOR GIRLS' EDUCATION.
AT THAT TIME I SAID WHY SHOULD IWAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE?
WHY SHOULD I BE LOOKING TO THEGOVERNMENT, TO THE ARMY, THAT
THEY WOULD HELP US?
WHY DON'T I RAISE MY VOICE?
WHY DON'T WESPEAK FOR OUR RIGHTS?
I STARTED WRITING DIARY.
I SPOKE ON EVERY MEDIA CHANNEL ICOULD.
I RAISE MY VOICE IN EVERYPLATFORM I COULD.
I SAID I NEED TO TELL THE WORLDWHAT IS HAPPENING IN SWAT AND I
NEED TO TELL THE WORLD THAT SWATIS SUFFERING FROM TERRORISM AND
WE NEED TO FIGHT AGAINSTTERRORISM.
>> Jon: WHEN DID YOU REALIZETHAT THE TALIBAN HAD MADE YOU A
TARGET?
>> WHEN IN 2012 I WAS WITH MYFATHER AND SOMEONE CAME AND TOLD
US HAVE YOU SEEN ON GOOGLE IFYOU SEARCH YOUR NAME THAT THE
TALIBAN HAS THREATENED YOU.
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.
I SAID IT'S NOT TRUE.
EVEN AFTER WHEN WE SAW IT I WASNOT WORRIED ABOUT MYSELF THAT
MUCH I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MYFATHER.
WE THOUGHT THAT THE TALIBANARE NOT THAT MUCH CRUEL THAT
THEY WOULD KILL A CHILD.
I STARTED THINKING ABOUTTHAT AND THINKING THE TALIB
WOULD COME AND HE WOULD KILL ME.
I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD YOU DOMALALA, I THOUGHT TAKE A SHOE
AND HIT HIM.
BUT I THOUGHT IF YOU HIT ATALIB WITH YOUR SHOE THEN
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEENYOU AND THE TALIB.
YOU MUST NOT TREAT OTHERS WITHCRUELTY AND HARSHLY.
YOU MUST FIGHT OTHERS BUTTHROUGH
PEACE, DIALOGUE AND EDUCATION.
THEN I TELL HIM HOW IMPORTANTEDUCATION IS AND I EVEN WANT
EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN ASWELL AND I WILL TELL HIM THAT'S
I WANT TO TELL YOU NOW DO WHATYOU WANT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I KNOW YOUR FATHER IS BACK STAGE
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I KNOW YOUR FATHER IS BACK STAGE
AND HE'S VERY PROUD OF YOU.
BUT WOULD HE BE MAD IF I ADOPTED YOU?
BECAUSE YOU SURE ARE SWELL.
COULD YOU STICK AROUND?
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MOREABOUT SWAT VALLEY AND WHAT IT
WAS LIKE GROWING UP THERE ANDHOW PEOPLE CAN GET INVOLVED
THROUGH THE MALALA FUND ANDTHOSE TYPES OF THINGS?
DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OFTIME?
>> YES, YEAH, SURE.
>> Jon: I AM MALALA IS ONSHELVES NOW.
