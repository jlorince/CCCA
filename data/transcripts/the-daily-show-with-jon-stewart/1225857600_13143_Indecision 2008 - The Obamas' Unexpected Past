>> WELCOME BACK.
OUR NEXT GUEST... OUR NEXT GUEST
IS A HARVARD LAW SCHOOL
PROFESSOR THAT SERVED AS MENTOR
TO BARACK OBAMA AND MRS. OBAMA,
MR. OGLETREE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NOW, SO YOU HAVE BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBAMA'S FOR
NEARLY 25 YEARS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND SO ARE YOU ALSO A
RADICAL OR ARE YOU...
>> NOT YET.
BUT IT IS STILL EARLY.
>> Jon: TONIGHT, THE RESULTS
ARE MOVING IN BARACK OBAMA'S
DIRECTION, HOW ARE YOU FEELING
ON THIS?
>> CAUTIOUS, BECAUSE IT IS NOT
OVER YET, AND I STILL HAVE SOME
FRIENDS IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEED
TO VOTE.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> ONCE CALIFORNIA IS DONE I
WILL BE HAPPY.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
>> NOW, IF OBAMA DOES PULL THIS
THING OUT AND BECOMES, YOU KNOW,
THE 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, IS, THEN, RACISM OVER?
>> NO.
>> BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING CHANGES, DOESN'T IT?
BARACK OBAMA WOULD BE THE
MAN.
>> EXACTLY.
SO WHITE PEOPLE, WE WOULD BE THE
OPPRESSED ONES, WOULDN'T WE?
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO, I DON'T
THINK SO.
>> IF I GET TO HOST THIS SHOW,
THEN THINGS WILL CHANGE.
( APPLAUSE )
>> I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
>> I DON'T SEE THAT AS
HAPPENING.
>> YOUR BOOK IS ENTITLED "FROM
LYNCH MOBS ZERO TO THE KEELG
STATE, RACE AND THE DEATH
PENALTY IN AMERICA".
FIRST OF
ALL, VERY CATCHY.
>> SECOND OF ALL, WHAT DO YOU
SEE -- IS THIS A TRANSFORMATIVE
MOMENT?
DID YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR
LIFETIME THAT YOU WOULD SEE A
MOMENT SUCH AS THIS?
>> I DID, ACTUALLY.
ME AND
MICHELLE MET IN 1985... THAT SHE
WOULD BE A PUBLIC SERVANT LIKE
SHE TOLD HER FATHER SHE WOULD
BE, I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE THE
ONE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, I
ASSUMED AFTER BARACK OBAMA'S
SUCCESS AT THE HARVARD LAW
REVIEW, HIS ROLE AT THE HARVARD
HE WOULD BE THE BEST MAYOR IN
THE CITY OF AMERICA.
THAT WAS MY EXPECTATION.
>> YOU THOUGHT HE WAS MORE OF AN
EXECUTIVE RATHER THAN SOMEONE --
>> GET YOUR CAT OUT OF THE TREE,
TAKE CARE OF YOUR LAUNDRY, YOU
KNOW, A GUY THAT IS ALWAYS
THERE.
>> MAYBE THERE HAS BEEN A
HIDEOUS MISTAKE HERE.
>> NOT YET.
>> MAYBE MICHELLE SHOULD HAVE
RUN AND HE SHOULD BE WRESTLING
CATS.
>> THE REALITY IS THAT MICHELLE
WILL BE A PHENOMENAL FIRST LADY,
BECAUSE SHE BRINGS SO MUCH TO
THE  TICKET.
( APPLAUSE )
>> WHEN YOU KNEW BOTH OF THEM AT
HARVARD LAW, DID YOU KNOW THEN
THEY WERE SOCIALISTS?
>> NO.
IN FACT, BACK THEN THEY WERE
PRETTY CONSERVATIVE.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE REPUBLICANS.
>> THEY STILL MIGHT BE.
>> SO THIS COULD BE A BIG WIN
FOR THE REPUBLICANS TONIGHT?
>> THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
THERE ARE SO MANY SECRETS ABOUT
HIM WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET.
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS
THOUGHT THAT THE REAL BARACK
OBAMA HAS BEEN HIDDEN FROM US,
THAT THIS TWO-YEAR PROCESS OF
LISTENING TO HIM EVERY SINGLE
DAY, THAT SOMEHOW AT THE END OF
THE OPERATION HE WILL PEEL OFF
THE MASK AND REVEAL HIS TRUE
SELF.
YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM 25 YEARS
WHAT IS THE SECRET?
>> THE SECRET IS HE HAS A GREAT
JUMP SHOT, THAT HE IS VERY GOOD
WITH HIS DIET, RIGHT?
AND HE
ALSO HAS A BRILLIANT MIND.
HE WILL FIX THE AMERICAN WAYS NO
PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO
DO.
THERE ARE TWO SKINNY GUYS FROM
ILLINOIS WHO MADE A DIFFERENCE,
ABE LINCOLN AND BARACK OBAMA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> CHARLES OGLETREE.
>> THANK YOU, YOU MAY GO AND WE
WILL GET MORE RESULTS.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> COULD YOU GIVE THIS BACK
TO...
>> EXACTLY.
>> STEVE, THAT WAS ACTUALLY
STEVE FORBES' WATER, YOU DON'T
WANT TO... YOU DON'T WANT TO...
HE STILL HAS THE LIPSTICK MARK.
>> WE ARE GOING TO GET TO SOME
RESULTS HERE NOW THAT I THINK
ARE REALLY NOT THAT SURPRISING,
TEXAS IS GOING TO BE, LARRY?
>> YES?
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> WHATEVER I WANT.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> OBAMA IS GOING TO WIN AND I
AM TAKING OVER THE SHOW.
TIME TO PAINT THE WHITE HOUSE
BLACK, BABY.
YOU KNOW, IT IS FUNNY PEOPLE
ARE SO WORRIED OBAMA WAS A
MUSLIM OR SOCIALIST, THEY
FORGOT THAT HE WAS BLACK.
BLACK PEOPLE DIDN'T FORGET
IT.
>> SO ARE THERE GOING TO BE
RIOTS OR --
>> NO, NOT LIKE THE LAKERS WON.
IT IS GOING TO BE THE SAME
AMERICA, JUST DARKER AND WITH
BAGGIER CLOTHES.
AND YOU CAN STILL HAVE STURDY
ROCK BUT NOW IT HAS ALEX CLAY
HORN.
IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, JON.
>> STORE.
I WILL SNEAK IN HERE.
>> SURE.
FROM NOW ON, THIS IS TYLER
PERRY'S HOUSE DAILY SHOW WITH
LARRY WILLMORE.
>> I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING
TO...
>> YOU KNOW, JON, IF I MAY,
WELL, I DON'T SEE COLONEL...
WHILE I DON'T SEE COLOR, I FEEL
A
KINDRED SPIRIT BETWEEN THE TWO
OF US, "THE DAILY SHOW" AND THE
"COLBERT REPORT" HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN
SIBLING SHOWS IN A WAY I SEE YOU
AS A BROTHER.
>> JON, I LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING WITH YOU.
>> WORKING WITH ME?
>> YES, FROM MY SHOW, THE
"COLBERT REPORT".
>> THAT REMINDS ME, HEY, LET'S
CHECK IN WITH OUR GOOD FRIEND,
HOW ARE YOU?
>> JUST POLISHING UP MY DESK, IT
IS SHAPED LIKE A C FOR CENAK.
ALL RIGHT, NATION, WHO IS
READY FOR A CENAK ATTACK?  YES!
>> NOOOOO!
>> WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK!
