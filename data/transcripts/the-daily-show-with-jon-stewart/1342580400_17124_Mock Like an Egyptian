>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NEW YORK GIANTS WIDE RECEIVER VICTOR CRUZ.
CRUISE-SANITY WHETHER... YEAH,
IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK, DOES IT?
(LAUGHTER) I'M JUST GRASPING AT STRAWS.
THAT'S ACTUALLY STEVE MARTIN,
THAT'S NOT REALLY...
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S WEST VIRGINIA.
I THINK HE JUST LABELED IT EGYPT.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S... AS YOU KNOW, EGYPT HAS RECENTLY HELD ITS FIRST FREE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE...
(LAUGHTER) ... THE INVENTION OF LANG LANGUAGE.
(LAUGHTER) THE WINNER, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD'S MOHAMMED MORSESY.
THAT'S MORRISSEY.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S MORRIS IS CAT.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S CONRAD BANE AND YOU'VE JUST LABELED HIM MODE MED MORSI.
THANK YOU.
SO ANYWAY, OUR INTREPID SECRETARY OF STATE SIR EDMUND HILLARY DENNIS ROM HAM CLINTON
WENT TO PAY HER ROPTS TO THEIR NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT AND...
>> ON SUNDAY SECRETARY CLINTON'S MOTORCADE WAS PELTED WITH
TOMATOES AND SHOES AS SHE LEFT THE NEWLY REOPENED U.S.
CONSULATE.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT?
WHAT IS GOING ON, EGYPT?
YOU'RE MAD AT US WHEN WE PROP UP YOUR DICTATOR FOR 30 YEARS AND
NOW YOU'RE MAD AT US WHEN WE GO VISIT THE GUY YOU VOTED FOR?
I MEAN, WHAT!
(LAUGHTER) YOU SUPPLY ONE COUNTRY'S MILITARY WITH TEAR GAS CANISTERS
THAT THEY USE ON THEIR OWN POPULOUS AND THEY NEVER STOP CRYING ABOUT IT.
(LAUGHTER) MAINLY BECAUSE THEIR TEAR DUCTS ARE DAMAGED.
(LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, I KNOW THAT YOU THERE IN EGYPT ARE NEW TO THE
WHOLE PUBLIC PROTEST THING THERE YOU KNOW, BUT THE LITERAL THROWING OF TOMATOES IS...
(LAUGHTER) IT'S A BIT OF A CLICHE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
PEOPLE IN THE POST-VAUDEVILLEIAN ERA DON'T ACTUALLY THROW TOMATOES.
UNLESS YOU'RE THROWING THEM AT BUGS BUNNY.
IF YOU INSIST ON THROWING FOOD,
WHY NOT BRING A BIT OF YOUR OWN CULTURE FARE.
LOOK AT THE GREEKS.
WHEN THEY'RE UPSET THEY THROW...
(LAUGHTER) WHEN THEY'RE UPSET THEY THROW BUCKETS OF THEIR COUNTRY'S
SIGNATURE BACTERIALLY FERMENTED MILK, YOGURT.
IT'S PROTEST STATEMENT AND AN EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL PRIDE.
YOU COULD THROW YOUR SHAWARMA.
YOUR A TEENY.
YOUR BABA GHANOUSH.
REALLY ANY OF THE FOODS THAT CAME UP WHEN WE SEARCHED EGYPTIAN CUISINE.
ON WIKIPEDIA.
(LAUGHTER) LOOK, EGYPT.
INSULTING HIGH-RANKING U.S.
OFFICIALS ISN'T GOING TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING AMERICA'S POWERFUL LEADERS RESPOND TO.
>> THE OBAMAS CAUGHT ON KISSCAM DURING THE BASKETBALL GAME VERSUS BRAZIL.
MICHELLE OBAMA LOOKED SHOCKED AND SHE SMILED AND WAVED.
THE DISAPPOINTED CROWD BOOED.
THEY GOT A SECOND CHANCE WHEN THE KISSCAM FOUND THEM AGAIN SO THIS TIME HE DELIVERED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE KISSCAM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ONLY THING THE MOST POWERFUL LEADERS IN THE WORLD BEND TO.
THAT'S ONE MORE REASON TO BE THANKFUL AL GORE WAS NEVER PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER) SURE OUR COUNTRY MIGHT NEVER HAVE INVADED IRAQ, THE EARTH'S
TEMPERATURE WOULD BE MAYBE A FEW DEGREES COOLER BUT NOT WORTH IT.
(LAUGHTER) AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN KINDS OF PRESSURE.
HAVE YOU HEARD THE FULL AUDIO OF REAGAN'S BERLIN WALL SPEECH?
(AS RONALD REAGAN) I REALIZE REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON THE VALUE OF THIS.
WHAT'S THAT?
DID YOU JUST SNEEZE AND SAY "PUSS ZI?" MR. GORBACHEV, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THAT IS AN EXACT AU
