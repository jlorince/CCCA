NOW LOOK-- ONE OF THE
SENATORS TAKING CHARGE OF
THIS ISSUE IS NEW YORK'S OWN
KIR TEN GILLEBRAN.
SHE IS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO BE
WITH US HERE NOW.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
SHOW, SENATOR GILLIBRAND.
GLAD FOR TO YOU BE HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> SENATOR, YOU YOURSELF
HAVE A HISTORY OF TAKING ON
IMPORTANT ALBEIT NARROW
BILLS LIKE, THERE IS A BILL,
DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS THAT
MADE YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE
HUGE, HORRIFIC EVIDENCE.
>> WELL, IT REALLY WAS THE
PERSONAL STORIES OF SOME
VICTIMS.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW THESE
MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT KNOCK
BUT TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY TO
STAND FOR OUR VALUES AN EVEN
DIE FOR OUR COUNTRY WERE
BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS, NOT
BY AN ENEMY ABROAD BUT
WITHIN THEIR OWN RANKS.
AND I WAS SO HEART BROKEN
THAT THEY EVEN SAID THINGS
LIKE I COULD SURVIVE THE
RAPE BUT WHAT I CON SURVIVE
WAS THE COMMANDING OFFICERS,
THE PEOPLE IN MY RANKS NOT
HAVING MY BACK, NOT
BELIEVING MEMENT AND FOR
26,000 CASES TO TAKE PLACE
LAST YEAR, IN LESS THAN 1%
PROSECUTED, IT'S OUTRAGE US.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACED
WITH.
>> IS WHAT WE JUST SAW PART
OF THE PROBLEM?
YOU LOOK AT THOSE OLD WHITE
PREDOMINANTLY MALE FACES.
THAT YOU ARE GOING UP
AGAINST IN THE EXTREME
THERE.
BECAUSE THE MILITARY IS BY
NATURE TERRITORIAL.
THAT'S KIND OF ITS MO.
AND THEY DON'T REALLY WANT
THE OUTSIDE FORCES ANYWHERE
NEAR THIS.
>> THEY DON'T WANT CHANGE.
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM,
WHETHER YOU LOOK AT, WHEN
THEY DEALT WITH SEGREGATION,
INTEGRATION AS THE SERVICES,
WHEN IT WAS HAVING WOMEN
ENTER THE SERVICES, WHEN IT
WAS ALLOWING GAYS TO SERVE
OPENLY IN THE MILITARY.
EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY HAVE
OPPOSED THAT.
AND THEY USED THE SAME
NARRATIVE.
THEY KEEP SAYING YOU CAN'T
POSSIBLY DO THAT T WILL
SOMEHOW UNDERMINE GOOD
DISCIPLINE.
I HAVE NEW FOR ITS MILITARY,
26,000 SEXUAL ASSAULTS A
YEAR IS NOT GOOD ORDER AND
DISCIPLINE.
AND THEY ARE -- --
(APPLAUSE)
BUT HERE'S THE CONFUSING
THING FOR ME.
BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE
OF THE MILITARY MEETING AND
BEING MARRIED TO ONE OF THEM
F THERE'S ONE THING THE
MILITARY CAN DO IT'S
EVERYTHING.
THEY CAN DO INCREDIBLE
THINGS.
THEY ARE A MISSION-FOCUSED
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO CAN
BUILD A TOWN IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DESERT AT NO MINUTES
NOTICE.
SO IF THIS IS A SIN OF
OMISSION IN A WAY BECAUSE
THEY'RE JUST NOT-- YOU FEEL
THAT IF THEY WANTED TO FIX
THIS, IT WOULD ALREADY HAVE
BEEN FIXED.
>> WELL, IT IS A FAILURE.
BECAUSE THE COMMANDERS ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE
THAT THERE IS A COMMAND
CLIMATE WHERE THIS RAPE
DOESN'T HAPPEN, WHERE A
SEXUAL ASSAULT DOESN'T
HAPPEN.
THENER THERE'S ALSO
RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE
THERE IS NO RETALIATIONMENT
BUT OF THE 3,000 VICTIMS WHO
DID REPORT THESE CRIMES LAST
YEAR, 62% SAID THEY WERE
RETALIATED AGAINST.
SO THEY ARE FAILING TO
CREATE GOOD ORDER AND
DISCIPLINE, FAILING TO
CREATE A CLIMATE WHERE
VICTIMS CAN COME FORWARD.
AND WE OWE THESE MEN AND
WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING OUR
COUNTRY MUCH MORE.
>> RIGHT, AND WHERE --
>> AND THANK YOU TO YOUR
WIFE FOR HER SERVICE, GOD
BLESS HER, GOD BLESS HER
(APPLAUSE)
>> SO WHERE IS THIS BILL?
YOU HAVE HOW MANY VOTE DOES
YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY
POLITICS IS A NUMBERS GAME,
NOT A HUMAN EMOTION GAME.
>> WHAT THE GOAL OF THE BILL
IS, IS WITH VICTIMS TELL SUS
THEY DON'T TRUST THE CHAIN
OF COMMAND.
EVEN THOUGH THE COMMANDERS
YOU SHOWED A PICTURE OF,
THEY TESTIFIED, AND SAID
THEY DON'T TRUST US, THEY
DON'T TRUST THE CHAIN OF
COMMAND.
SO THE PROBLEM IS CLEAR.
WHAT WE WANT TO CREATE IS AN
OBJECTIVE REVIEW BY A
TRAINED MILITARY PROSECUTOR,
SOMEONE WITHOUT IS ACTUALLY
A LAWYER TRAINED TO WEIGH
EVIDENCE AND MAKE THE
FUNDAMENTAL DECISION, DOES
THE CASE GO FORWARD.
THAT DECISION TO BE
OBJECTIVE.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A VICTIM,
THE PERSON IS GOING TO
DECIDE HER CASE IS HER BOSS,
WHO MAY WELL KNOW HER
ASSAILANT, WHO KNOWS HER.
THERE IS NO OBJECTIVITY.
SO WHAT WE ARE CREATING TO
CREATE IS AN OBJECTIVE
SYSTEM AND WE HAVE ABOUT 46
SENATORS WHO ARE PUBLICLY
SUPPORTING IT TODAY.
WE HAVE TO GET TO AT LEAST
51.
>> ALL LISS THIS IS SEXUAL
ASSAULT,.
>> IT IS MORE THAN HALF THE
VICTIM ARE MALE, MORE THAN
HALF.
>> LET'S JUST MAKE THAT
CLEAR.
THIS IS NOT --
>> NOT JUST ABOUT WOMEN,
MORE THAN HALF THE VICTIMS
ARE MALE.
>> NOW YOU MANAGED TO PICK
OFF ONE BY ONE SOME SENATORS,
ARE YOU INCLUDING TED CRUZ
AND RAND PAUL, DOES THAT
EVEN WHERE THE LEGITIMACY OF
THIS BILL DOES THAT EVER
GIVE YOU PAUSE THINKING HOLD
ON, TED CRUZ SUPPORTS THIS?
>> WELL, I'M VERY GRATEFUL
FOR THEIR SUPPORT.
AND SOME ISSUES WERE NOT
DEMOCRATIC ISSUES OR
REPUBLICAN ISSUES.
>> YES.
>> SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
AND I THINK THAT PRINCIPLES--
(APPLAUSE)
>> WE HAVE TO TAKE A QUICK
BREAK.
WE'RE GOING TO BACK WITH
MORE FROM THE SENATOR AFTER
THE BREAK.
SENATOR GILLEBRAND,
