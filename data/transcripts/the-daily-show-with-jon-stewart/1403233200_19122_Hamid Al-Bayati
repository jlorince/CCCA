>> Jon: MY GUST TONIGHT WASTHE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF
IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS FROM2006 TO 2013.
PLEASE WELCOME HAMID AL-BAYATI.
SIR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELL, THANK YOU MUCH FOR JOININGUS.
WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUBEING HERE BECAUSE ON AMERICAN
TELEVISION, THERE ARE A LOT OFTALKING HEADS SAYING, "WHAT'S
GOING ON IN IRAQ?"BUT WE DON'T... BOY, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS, KNOW THATMUCH ABOUT IT.
[LAUGHTER]YOU PERHAPS MIGHT KNOW MORE.
SO WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE RIGHT NOW?
>> JON, DEFINITELY I KNOW MORETHAN MOST OF THE AMERICANS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: KIND OF GOES WITHOUT
SAYING.
I FIGURED THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
SO HIT ME.
HIT ME.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> THE IRAQ I WAS BORN IN ANDGROWN UP IN IS AN IRAQ OF UNITY.
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LOVE TOLIVE IN PEACE AND HARMONY.
MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, JEWS, THEYLIVED FOR CENTURIES.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE MINORITIES,FAR EXTREMISTS, AND
UNFORTUNATELY THEY MAKE HIGHNOISES, LOUDER NOISES, AND THE
MEDIA PICK UP THESE NOISES ANDMAKE IT BIGGER. NOW, THERE'S THE
FACT THAT THERE IS SPILLOVER FROM INSTABILITY IN SYRIA.
ISIS IS AL QAEDA IN IRAQ ANDSYRIA IN THE BEGINNING.
THEN AL QAEDA CONSIDERED THEMTOO EXTREME AND THEY --
>> Jon: AL QAEDA CONSIDERS THISISIS GROUP...
>> TOO EXTREME FOR THEM.
IMAGINE, YOU KNOW?
>> JON: SO AL QAEDA, THE GROUPRESPONSIBLE FOR 9/11, THEY SEE
THESE GUYS AND THEY GO, NO, ICAN'T WORK WITH THEM.
[LAUGHTER]>> EXACTLY.
THEY'RE TOO MUCH.
SO NOW WE ARE FACING THIS GROUPWHO ARE BRUTAL.
THE UNITED NATIONS REPORTS THATTHEY ARE COMMITTING WAR CRIMES.
THEY EXECUTE THOUSANDS OFPEOPLE, INCLUDING CIVILIANS, IN
MOSUL AND OTHER AREAS.
>> Jon: BUT LET ME ASK YOU,SO, THE REPORTS THAT WE GET IS,
SO WE LEAVE IRAQ.
EVERYBODY SAYS IRAQ IS READY.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER THEGOVERNANCE AND SECURITY OF THIS
NATION.
YOU WERE THERE DURING THAT TIME.
YOU FELT GOOD ABOUT THATARRANGEMENT.
EVERYBODY FELT GOOD.
THESE GUYS ROLL IN, AND THEIRAQI ARMY SEEMS TO DISPERSE,
AND THEY TAKE OVER THIS AREA INMOSUL.
AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE, BECAUSE ITSEEMS LIKE THEY'VE NOW JOINED UP
WITH THE ORIGINAL BA'ATHISTSFROM SADDAM'S OLD GROUP, AND
THEY SEEM TO BE ALLIED NOW.
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
>> YES, NOT ONLY ISIS.
ISIS IS 5,000 TO 6,000PERSONNEL.
>> Jon: 5,000 TO 6,000.
>> ONLY, ONLY.
>> Jon: SERIOUSLY, THAT'S IT?
>> YEAH. THE HIGHEST ESTIMATIONIS 10,000, HOWEVER, THE BA'ATH
PARTY IS HEADED OR LED BY IZZATAL-DOURI WHO WAS VICE PRESIDENT
FOR SADDAM. THE INSURGENCY GROUPLIKE NAQSHABANDI GROUP
AND OTHER GROUPS ARE JOINING.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS SIMILAR TOWHAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE ANBAR
PROVINCE IN 2006?
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,THE IRAQI ARMY WAS NOT WELL
EQUIPPED.
WE ASKED FOR, FOR EXAMPLE, JETFIGHTERS.
WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM YET.
THE CONGRESS APPROVED F-16sSINCE MANY YEARS.
WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM. NOW WEASKED,
THIS IS WHY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENTOFFICIALLY REQUESTED AN AIR
STRIKE BY AMERICAN FORCES.
NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCEDTODAY THAT THEY COULD TAKE
CERTAIN TARGETS, PRECISE ATTACKSWHENEVER THEY FEEL IT'S
IMPORTANT. I THINKIT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE
GATHER TOGETHER TO FIGHTTHIS EXTREME GROUP.
>> Jon: SO YOU WOULD LIKE US TOJOIN THE FIGHT?
>> I WOULD SAY THIS IS THE IRAQIGOVERNMENT REQUEST.
>> Jon: THE IRAQI GOVERNMENTWOULD LIKE US TO JOIN THE FIGHT?
>> YES, THEY REQUEST AMERICANAIR STRIKES, NOT JUST IN TROOPS,
GROUND TROOPS, THAT'S ADIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONLY
AMERICANS AND DRONES ANDYEMEN AND PAKISTAN AND OTHER
AREAS.
>> Jon: THIS IS WHAT, YOU WOULDLIKE OUR DRONE PROGRAM.
WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT PACKAGES.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE? [LAUGHTER]
SO LET ME SEE, LET ME GET YOURORDER RIGHT.
>> OKAY.
OKAY.
>> Jon: THE AMERICANS WOULD...
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN SORT OF AVERY STRANGE POSITION IN THAT WE
DID DESTABILIZE YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME.
[LAUGHTER]I THINK AMERICANS FEEL LIKE WE
HAD SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY,A LOT OF BLOOD FOR REASONS THAT,
YOU KNOW, WE CAN FIGHT ABOUTWHETHER OR NOT IT WAS RIGHT TO
GO IN OR NOT, BUT THAT MAYBE WEDO HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO
THE IRAQI PEOPLE AFTER DOINGTHAT, BUT OUR ABILITY TO
WITHSTAND SORT OF BEING THEFABRIC THAT HOLDS THE COUNTRY
TOGETHER FROM THESE SECTARIANVIOLENCE ISSUES AND THESE
EXTREMIST VIOLENCE ISSUES, ISNOT A TENABLE POSITION FOR US TO
BE IN.
>> WELL, THERE IS AN IMPORTANTFACTOR THAT ABU MUSAB
AL-ZARQAWI. AND BY THE WAY...
>> ZARQAWI WAS THE OLD LEADEROF THIS GROUP.
THE JORDANIAN THAT WAS KILLED AWHILE AGO.
>> YES.
ISIS WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF THEZARQAWI GROUP WHO WAS SEPARATE
FROM AL QAEDA.
ZARQAWI WROTE A LETTER TO OSAMABIN LADEN WHEN HE ANNOUNCED
ALLEGIANCE TO HIM, SAYING THATIF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT GETS
STRONGER AND CONTROL THESITUATION, THERE WILL BE NO
OPTION BUT TO PACK AND LEAVEAS WE DID IN AFGHANISTAN.
THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO BRINGSECTARIAN WAR BETWEEN SUNNIS AND
SHIA. THIS IS WHY...
>> Jon: SO THEY'RE FOMENTINGTHIS WAR.
THEY WANT THIS LARGER SECTARIANWAR.
>> YES. ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIWHOSE REAL NAME IS IBRAHIM AWWAD
AL-BADRI, HE TRIED TO PLAY THATSECTARIAN CARD.
>> Jon: HE WANTS TO FOMENT THISWAR.
WELL, LET'S DO THIS. LET'S TAKEBREAK.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FAR LITTLEBIT?
>> YES. BECAUSE WHAT I WANT TOTALK ABOUT
WHEN WE COME BACK IS, WOULDHE BE ABLE TO ENFLAME
THAT SECTARIAN WAR IFTHE AL-MALIKI GOVERNMENT HAD
BEEN MORE OPEN TO POWER SHARINGWITH THE SUNNI MINORITY AND HAS
THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS.
SO WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LLTALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
WE'LL HAVE MORE WITH HAMIDAL-BAYATI RIGHT AFTER THIS.
