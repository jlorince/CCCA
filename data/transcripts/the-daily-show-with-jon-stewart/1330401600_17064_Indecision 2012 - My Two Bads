US TO A MADRASSAH.
FOR MORE ON RICK SANTORUM'S
COMMENTS WE SEND TO JESSICA
WILLIAMS WHO JOINS US LIVE.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT COLLEGE ARE YOU REPORTING
FROM?
>> DOES IT EVEN MATTER, JON?
I MEAN THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.
YOU GOT YOUR QUAD.
YOUR STUDENT CENTER.
YOUR FEMINIST BOOKSTORE.
YOUR GAY BOOKSTORE.
YOUR DRIVE-THROUGH ABORTION
CHRICHB I CAN.
... CLINIC.
>> Jon: YOU ARE TECHNICALLY
STILL A COLLEGE STUDENT, YES?
YOU'VE SUSPENDED YOUR STUDIES
A BIT TO BE ON THE PROGRAM
WITH US.
>> YEP.
YOU KNOW AFTER ALL THIS DAILY
SHOW BUSINESS DIES DOWN, I'M
TOTALLY GOING BACK.
>> Jon: YOU'RE NEVER GOING
BACK, ARE YOU?
>> NOT IN A MILLION YEARS,
JON.
I'M ON TV!
>> Jon: VERY NICE.
>> LOOK, TAKE IT FROM ME,
KIDS.
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND YOU GET
TO BE ON TV.
>> Jon: NO, NO.
THAT'S THE WRONG... SO, WHAT
DO YOU SAY TO THIS WHOLE
COLLEGE IS JUST A LIBERAL
INDOCTRINATION CENTER WHERE
BARACK OBAMA IS MAKING
STUDENTS IN HIS IMAGE.
>> IT'S ALL TRUE, JON.
CHECK THIS OUT.
THIS IS ME THREE YEARS AGO.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: THAT DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE YOU.
>> IT DEFINITELY IS ME.
I USED TO BE A SWEET, INNOCENT
CHURCH GOING GIRL WHO BELIEVED
VOLCANOS HAPPENED WHEN THE
DEVIL HAS HICK CUPS.
THEN I WENT TO COLLEGE, AND
THEY EXPOSED ME TO NEW IDEAS.
LITERATURE, PHILOSOPHY,
SOMETHING CALLED SCIENCE.
AND BY THE END OF SOPHOMORE
YEAR, I WAS A BLACK GIRL.
>> Jon: IT WAS ALL TRUE.
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
IF I WOULD HAVE STAYED ONE
MORE YEAR, I WOULD HAVE LOOKED
LIKE THIS.
>> Jon: JESSICA, YOU KNOW, I
WENT TO COLLEGE AND THAT
DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME.
>> YEAH, YOU'RE SUPER OLD AND
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL LIKE 60
YEARS AGO.
THEY PROBABLY REMADE YOU INTO
JIMMY CARTER'S IMAGE.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
PEANUTS.
WHERE DID THESE COME FROM?
WAIT.
ISN'T THE POINT OF COLLEGE TO
EXPOSE YOUNG ADULTS TO NEW
IDEAS AND NEW WAYS OF
THINKING?
>> SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE.
YOUNG ADULTS, KIDS TURN 18 AND
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY START
THINKING FOR THEMSELVES.
BUT IF THEY NEVER GROW UP,
THEY'LL NEVER GET OBAMA-FIED.
>> Jon: ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT SANTORUM IS NAIVE 16-TO
17-YEAR-OLD GIRLS IN CATHOLIC
UNIFORMS WHO BELIEVES WHATEVER
SANTORUM TELLS THEM.
