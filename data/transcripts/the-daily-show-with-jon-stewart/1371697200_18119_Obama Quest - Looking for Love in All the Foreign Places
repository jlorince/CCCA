(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
I AM JOHN OLIVER STILL HERE FOR
JON STEWART WHO, AT THIS HOUR,
REMAINS TRAPPED IN A CHILEAN
MINE WITH 18 OTHER TALK SHOW
HOSTS.
(LAUGHTER)
MY GUEST TONIGHT: THE FILMMAKER
OF A NEW DOCUMENTARY "GIDEON'S
ARMY" DAWN PORTER IS HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FANTASTIC, FANTASTIC
DOCUMENTARY.
BUT LET'S START TONIGHT WITH OUR
PRESIDENT, BARACK HANK OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER)
HE HAS BEEN HAVING A BIT OF A
ROUGH TIME DOMESTICALLY: FAILED
PUSH FOR GUN CONTROL, NATIONAL
SECURITY LEAKS, HIS INCREASINGLY
PATHETIC JUMP SHOT.
(LAUGHTER)
OR, AS IT'S KNOWN IN THE WHITE
HOUSE NOW, AIR BALL ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, NONE OF THIS IS MAKING HIM
PARTICULARLY POPULAR AT HOME AND
LOOK AT HIM.
LOOK HOW SAD WE'VE MADE HIM.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
LOOK HOW SAD HE'S PARTIALLY MADE
HIMSELF.
HE'S LOST THAT "BEING LOVED"
FEELING ANDING LIKE A FIGURE
FROM GREEK MYTHOLOGY, HE MUST
TRAVEL TO FIND THAT WHICH HE HAS
LOST IN A PLACE FAR FROM HOME.
THE JOURNEY BEGINS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> John: YES.
YES.
HE MUST FIND IT.
YES, HE IS CURRENTLY IN THE
MIDST OF THE FIRST OF TWO SUMMER
TRIPS ABROAD.
TODAY WITH HIS BIG SPEECH IN
WHAT I CALL "THE HAPPIEST PLACE
ON EARTH," GERMANY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, HEY, HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT HAVE
YOU BEEN THERE?
GERMANY'S ACTUALLY ALWAYS BEEN
GOOD TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.
BACK IN 2008 BEFORE HE WAS EVEN
PRESIDENT 200,000 GERMANS TURNED
UP TO HEAR HIM SPEAK.
A MEASUREMENT KNOWN IN GERMANY
AS HALF A HASSELHOFF CONCERT.
(LAUGHTER)
OR IN GERMAN HEFTY HASSLE HALF
CONCERT!
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE.
SO TO GET HIS MOJO BACK THE
PRESIDENT IS BACK IN BERLIN FOR
A BRANDENBURG PICK ME UP.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SEX
ACT OF THE SAME NAME.
(LAUGHTER)
IS HE STILL A ROCK STAR OVER
THERE?
>> HE'S NOT THE ROCK STAR HE WAS
WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR THE
PRESIDENCY AND HAD 200,000
PEOPLE OUT THERE SWOONING OVER
HIM.
WE'RE EXPECTING WELL BELOW
10,000 TO SEE HIM TODAY.
>> John: WOW!
LOSING 95% OF YOUR AUDIENCE IN
JUST FIVE YEARS.
THAT'S BASICALLY MAKING OBAMA
THE NBC OF PRESIDENTS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S RIGHT.
SO THE TRIP TO GERMANY WAS A
SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT OR, AS
THEY SAY IT IN GERMNY (SPEAKING
GERMAN)
LIKE BUTNER THE MOUTH, LIKE YOUR
TONGUE IS PLYING THE VIOLIN.
WHAT IS WITH THE TINY TURNOUT.
>> THE GERMAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY
UPSET ABOUT THE N.S.A.
CONTROVERSY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
HISTORY WITH THE SECRET POLICE,
THE STASI.
>> John: I GUESS THAT MAKES
SENSE!
THE PRESIDENT'S WHOLE N.S.A.
EXCUSE OF "WE ONLY SPY ON
FOREIGNERS" DOESN'T PLAY SO WELL
WITH -- UM, WHAT'S THE WORD?
OH, FOREIGNERS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THIS SPYING THING IS REALLY
HAUNTING HIM.
AND NOT JUST IN GERMANY.
EARLIER THIS WEEK HE WAS IN
IRELAND FOR THE G-8 SUMMIT, AN
IMPORTANT CHANCE TO BUILD TRUST
BETWEEN NATIONS.
BUT BEFORE THE HAND SHAKE
CEREMONY WAS EVEN OVER --
>> THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER THE
"GUARDIAN" HAS DROPPED YET
ANOTHER SECURITY BOMBSHELL.
THE LATEST REPORT FROM THE
"GUARDIAN" FINGERS BOTH THE U.S.
AND THE U.K. FOR SPYING ON
FOREIGN LEADERS.
>> AT THE G-20 SUMMIT IN 2009
THE BRITS EVEN SET UP FAKE
INTERNET CAFES TO STEAL E-MAIL
INFORMATION FROM DELEGATES.
>> John: OKAY, THE BIGGEST
SHOCKER THERE: WHO WAS STILL
USING INTERNET CAFES IN 2009?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN OLD SAYING
IN THE SPY GAME: NEVER TRANSMIT
CLASSIFIED DATA NEXT TO A
HOMELESS MAN
