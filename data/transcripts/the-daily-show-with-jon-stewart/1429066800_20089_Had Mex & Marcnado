>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
PRESIDENTIAL RACE HAS BEENHEATING UP FOR DAYS NOW.
BUT YESTERDAY, IT WENT STRAIGHTPHOSPHOROUS.
MARCO RUBIO ANNOUNCED HISCANDIDACY.
POPULAR REPUBLICAN, WELL-SPOKEN,HANDSOME, THIRSTY,
HE LOVES WATER.
MARCO RUBIO, GET READY TODOMINATE THE NEWS CYCLE.
>> HILLARY CLINTON LATE THISAFTERNOON SPOTTED IN OHIO AT
THIS CHIPOTLE.
MEANWHILE, AS SHE WAS ORDERING,A NEW FACE IN THE RACE FOR
PRESIDENT, SENATOR MARCO RUBIOANNOUNCING HE WAS RUNNING.
>> Jon: BAD LUCK!
HOW COULD RUBIO HAVE KNOWNTHAT ON THE EXACT SAME DAY HE
WAS LAUNCHING HIS CANDIDACY,HILLARY CLINTON WOULD
EAT LUNCH! (LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, NOT QUITE SURE WHYHILLARY EATS CHIPOTLE IS NEWS.
I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T EAT ATCHIPOLTLE?
IT'S THE FRESHEST MEXICAN THISSIDE OF THE BORDER, BY
THE WAY, THIS HEADLINEBROUGHT TO YOU BY CHIPOTLE.
CHIPOTLE, SEND US FOOD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)JUST PUT IT IN ARBY'S BAGS,
AND BRING IT OVER, WE'RE FINE.
AND THE NEWS MEDIA DIDN'T JUSTCOVER SECRETARY CLINTON'S
FAST FOOD CHOICE,THEY WENT ALL IN.
>> THE ONLY CLINTON SIGHTINGCAME AT A CHIPOTLE
>> SHE'S LIKE US, SHE EATS ATCHIPOTLE.
>> SECURITY VIDEO CAPTURED HERORDERING A BURRITO BOWL.
>> SHE STOPPED AT CHIPOTLE INOHIO.
>> SHE HAD A CHICKEN BURRITOBOWL WITH BLACK BEANS.
>> I BELIEVE SHE ALSO ORDEREDICED TEA.
>> SHE ALSO ORDERED GUAC.
>> Jon: HOW MANY NAPKINS? JONSTEWART, ASSOCIATED PRESS,
HOW MANY NAPKINS DID SHE TAKE?
I BET IT WAS THREE.
COULD HAVE BEEN FOUR.
TELL ME. YOU CALL YOURSELVES ANEWS NETWORK!
HOW MANY [BLEEP] NAPKINS!
I WAS GOING TO DO THE DESK FLIPBUT THEN I, IT'S STRONGER
THAN MY BACK.
APPARENTLY ALL THE NETWORKSGOT IN ON THE SNACK-TION.
MSNBC DELVED INTO JUST HOWEATING FOOD PROVED CLINTON
WAS A MAMMAL, WHEREAS FOX PROVEDSHE WAS A MONSTER.
>> IF BILL CLINTON WENT INTO ACHIPOTLE, THEY WOULD HAVE LOVED
HIM.
AND INSTEAD HILLARY CLINTONVISITED AND NOBODY KNEW IT.
>> WAS THIS THE BEST WAY TOCONNECT WITH A CHICKEN BURRITO
BOWL? SHE'S NOT RELATABLE. SHEGOES INTO CHIPOTLE.
SHE'S DRESSED UP.
>> AGAIN, WE'RE SORT OF SEEING ALACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THIS
SECRET MOBILE DRIVING AROUND.
>> IT'S HARD TO BE TRANSPARENTBEHIND THOSE BIG SUNGLASSES.
>> BY THE WAY.
>> Jon: I MEAN, THOSEGLASSES. WHAT'S SHE HIDING?
DOES SHE EVEN HAVE EYES?
IS SHE EVEN HUMAN? IS SHEMOTHRA?
I ASSUME CNN JUST WENT FULLMALAYSIAN AIRPLANE ON THIS
THING WITH A COMPUTER SIMULATIONOF HOW WITNESSES SAID THE ORDER
MIGHT HAVE GONE DOWN AND THENCORRESPONDENT TOM FOREMAN
ANALYZING THE LIKELYCONTENTS OF THE BURRITO
ITSELF, THE RICE,THE BEANS, THE SOUR CREAM,
THEY'VE GOT IT ALL!
LOOK, THERE IS AN IMPORTANTLATINO POLITICAL STORY HERE
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONE THATHAPPENED AT CHIPOTLE!
CAN WE PLEASE HEAR FROM THE VERYJUNIOR SENATOR FROM FLORIDA?
>> TOO MANY OF OUR LEADERS ANDTHEIR IDEAS ARE STUCK IN THE
20th CENTURY, SO OUR LEADERSPUT US AT A DISADVANTAGE BY
TAXING AND BORROWING ANDREGULATING LIKE IT WAS 1999.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: HE'S VERY PLEASED WITH
THAT JOKE.
THEY ARE TAXING US ANDREGULATING US LIKE IT'S 1999.
(LAUGHTER)NO ONLY IS THE JOKE IS SLIGHTLY
LAME BUT IT'S A LITTLEINACCURATE.
I MEAN, THE AMERICAN ECONOMYSHOULD BE SO LUCKY AS TO BE LIKE
IT WAS IN 1999.
THE CLINTON ERA YEAR WAS THEPEAK OF POSSIBLY THE GREATEST
PEACETIME BOOM IN OUR HISTORY.
BUDGET SURPLUS, LOW INFLATION,HIGH EMPLOYMENT.
OH, MARCO YOUNG PADAWAN, I KNOWWHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A JOKE
SO GOOD YOU WANT TO THROW ITOUT THERE EVEN THOUGH
IT'S COMPLETE RUBBISH.
ASIDE FROM THAT ATTEMPT ATHUMOR, RUBIO SHARED AN INSPIRING
PERSONAL STORY OF HARD WORKAND THE AMERICAN DREAM,
WHICH I THINK ANYONE WATCHINGYESTERDAY FOUND VERY COMPELLING.
>> PART OF WHY YESTERDAY IS SOSUCCESSFUL IS SHE'S LOOK LIKE
SHE'S HAVING FUN AND SHE'S DOINGFOR HER NEW STUFF.
WE'VE NEVER SEEN HER GET ABURRITO BEFORE.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
I MEANT ANYONE WOULD HAVE FOUNDRUBIO'S STORY COMPELLING WERE
HISTORY NOT BEING MADE AT ANOHIO CHIPOTLE.
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG (BLEEP)ELECTION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
