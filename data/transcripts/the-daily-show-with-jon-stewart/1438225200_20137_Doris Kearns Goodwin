HISTORIAN, BESTSELLING BOOK"LYNDON JOHNSON AND THE
AMERICAN DREAM" IS GONNA BECOMEAVAILABLE AS AN eBOOK ON
AUGUST 4th. PLEASE WELCOMEBACK TO OUR PROGRAM DORIS
KEARNS GOODWIN. COME OUTHERE, DORIS.
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT.
HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TODO.
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE MODERNPOLITICS AND THEN A LITTLE
LBJ.
HERE'S WHAT I WANNA ASK YOU,DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN.
WE ARE IN A SITUATION RIGHTNOW, WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY WITH 16 CANDIDATES.
YOURSELF AS AN HISTORIAN,HAVE YOUIVE SEEN A PRIMARY
FIELD THAT IS 16 PEOPLEDEEP?
IS THIS, HOW UNPRECEDENTEDIS THIS?
>> NEVER HAVE I SEEN IT.
NEVER, EVER, EVER.
>> Jon: AND IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW.
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT UPSOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S
HAPPENED BEFORE.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO.
BUT WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> WELL, HERE'S THE CRAZYTHING.
YOU KNOW, THE FIRSTPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WAS IN
1912 WHEN TEDDY ROOSEVELTWANTED TO BE PRESIDENT AND
TAFT WAS ALREADY PRESIDENT.
SO HE NEEDED A PRIMARYBECAUSE TAFT HAD CONTROL OF
THE PARTY MACHINERY.
THEY STARTED YELLING AT EACHOTHER SO MUCH, CALLING EACH
OTHER PUZZLEWITS, FAT HEADS --
>> Jon: PUZZLEWITS?
-- PUZZLEWITS, FAT HEADS,TRAITORS, THAT "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" WROTE AN EDITORIALSAYING IF THIS IS THE FIRST
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, ITSHOULD BE THE LAST.
IT SHOULD MAKE EVERYAMERICAN BLUSH.
SO THEY SAID LET'S GO BACKTO THE CONVENTION SYSTEM
WHICH WAS RATIONAL.
IN THE SUMMER YOU NOMINATESOMEBODY.
TWO MONTHS IN THE FALL ANDIT'S OVER.
I WOULD GO BACK TO THATTOMORROW.
YOU MUST LOVE IT, BUT I MEANIT'S TOO LONG.
>> Jon: I LOVE THAT, "I MEANIT'S DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY FROM
THE INSIDE, IT'S CORROSIVE,YOU MUST LOVE IT."
BUT THE THING IS, BUT COMPLETELYUNDERSTANDABLE.
I WONDER ABOUT THIS,CITIZENS UNITED OPENED THE
PROCESS UP TO BILLIONAIRESAND MULTIMILLIONAIRES OF ALL
STRIPES.
AND I WONDER IF THESECANDIDATES ARE ABLE TO, IN
THE ABSENCE OF WHAT APPEARSTO BE ANY POPULAR SUPPORT,
STAY IN BECAUSE THEY HAVEGOT A BACKER.
AND BACKERS CAN HELP YOURIDE.
>> THAT'S THE HORSE METAPHOR,SOMEBODY IS BETTING ON THEM.
I THINK IF I WERE YOUNG NOW,THE THING I WOULD DO MORE
THAN ANYTHING WAS TO FIGHTFOR AN AMENDMENT UNDER
CITIZENS UNITED.
AND THAT IS ONE OF THETHINGS YOU SHOULD DO TOO.
REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUTWRITING A BOOK TOGETHER.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IT IS THE MOST POISONOUSTHING HAPPENING IN OUR
SYSTEM THAT MONEY IS DOINGEVERYTHING.
THEY ARE SPENDING ALL THEIRTIME RAISING FUNDS.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> Jon: HERE IS WHAT IS SOWONDERFUL ABOUT THAT.
I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THEGOODNESS IN YOU.
WHEN YOU SAID I WISH IWAS YOUNG BECAUSE I WOULD
FIGHT FOR THAT.
IF I WISHED I WERE YOUNG, IWOULD RUN AROUND NAKED
IN SUPERMARKETS.
>> WELL, I MIGHT DO THATTOO.
WHILE I'M FIGHTING FOR THEAMENDMENT.
>> Jon: OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH. IJUST WANT TO POINT OUT THE
DISPARITY IN HOW WE CAREABOUT PEOPLE.
AND THE OTHER THING, AS ANHISTORIAN, HOW DO YOU DEAL
WITH THIS INFLUX OF E-MAILAS HISTORICAL RECORD?
AND THE ABILITY FOR THAT TOBE ERASED.
HILARY CLINTON HAD A SERVER INHER HOUSE.
AS AN HISTORIAN, WHAT ARE WEGOING TO DEAL WITH AS FAR AS
AN HISTORICAL RECORD.
AND I USE "AN" HISTORICAL TOSOUND SMARTER.
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALPROBLEM BECAUSE FOR US
HISTORIANS, THE MOSTIMPORTANT THING IN THE OLD
DAYS WERE LETTERS ANDDIARIES.
THEY DON'T KEEP THEM ANYMORE, RIGHT.
HANDWRITTEN LETTERS, DIARIES.
SO WE DEPEND ON THE EMAILS.
THE ONE PERIOD THAT WASTOTALLY GONE FROM HISTORY IS
THE TELEPHONE PERIOD.
YOU CALL SOMEBODY UP ON THEPHONE, YOU NEVER HAVE A
RECORD -- EXCEPT IF ARE YOULYNDON JOHNSON AND YOU DO
THE TAPES.
>> Jon: OR NIXON.
>> HERE SAY GREAT STORY.
SO LYNDON JOHNSON HAS THISLITTLE TAPE MACHINE IN HIS
OVAL OFFICE, HE PRESSES THEBUTTON.
YOU LISTEN TO THESE TAPES,YOU WILL LOVE THEM IF YOU'LL
LOVE THEM, IF HAVEN'T LISTENED.
THERE IS ONE WHERE HE ISTALKING TO HIS TROUSER
MANUFACTURE.
>> Jon: HE HAS A TROUSERMANUFACTURER?
>> AND HE WANTS 12 PAIRS OFTROUSER BUT HE SAID I HAVE A
PROBLEM.
I VARY MY WEIGHT EACH MONTHSO I GO UP 10 OR 15 POUNDS.
DO YOU KNOW THAT AREA WHERETHE CROTCH IS, YOU KNOW, WHERE
THE BALLS HANG DOWN?
SOMETIMES IF IT'S TOO TIGHT, YOUKNOW, IT IS LIKE A WIRE FENCE I
FEEL LIKE I'M SITTING ON -- ANDTHEN THERE'S THAT  OTHER AREA
WHERE THE BUNGHOLE IS.
SOMETIMES THAT IS TOO TIGHT.
>> Jon: AND THS IS ON TAPE.
>> IT'S ON TAPE, AND, AS AHISTORIAN, YOU LOVE IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: NOW THAT IS ANEXHIBIT IN HIS LIBRARY, I
DON'T REMEMBER.
>> BUT THEN YOU GET TO KNOWTHE GUY.
NO, BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU NEEDTO KNOW THE PERSONAL AND THE
PUBLIC TOGETHER.
THE OTHER STORY THATHAPPENED, I MET THIS GUY WHO
WAS THE C.E.O. OFPEPSI-COLA.
SO HE TOLD ME KNEW LYNDONJOHNSON AND HE KNEW NIXON
WHEN NIXON FIRST BECAMEPRESIDENT.
SO NIXON ASKED HIM TO GO TOGENERAL SON RANCH TO TALK ABOUT
SOME PRIVATE MATTER.
JOHNSON'S GRUMPY, HE'S WORKINGON HIS MEMORIS, HE SAID HOW CAN
I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED 20YEARS AGO, 30 YEARS AGO.
ONLY CHAPTERS THAT ARE ANY GOODWERE -- I HAD THIS LITTLE TAPE
MACHINE, IT HAD A LITTLE BUTTON.
THOSE CHAPTERS ARE GREAT.
SO YOU GO BACK AND TELL YOURFRIEND RICHARD NIXON AS HE
STARTS HIS PRESIDENCY,NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN
A TAPING SYSTEM.
>> Jon: IT WAS JOHNSON'SFAULT.
>> IT WAS JOHNSON.
>> Jon: INCREDIBLE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, ILOVE YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGWITH US.
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT DID THELETTERS AND DIARIES KNEW
THEY WERE WRITING FORHISTORY, SO I IMAGINE THAT
WAS POINTED.
IT WOULD SEEM LIKE JEFFERSON ANDADAMS ALWAYS KNEW THEY WERE
WRITING FOR EACH OTHER BUT FORHISTORY.
I'M A GREAT MAN WHO DOESN'TLIKE SLAVERY.
LIKE, IT WAS A LOT OF THAT.
SO YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THATSTUFF.
>> YOU NEVER KNOW.
BUT AT LEAST ITS A HEHANDWRITTEN AND YOU SAVE IT
AT THE END OF THE DAY AND THEYARE WRITING THEIR WIFE.
AND IT'S GOOD STUFF.
>> Jon: AND WHEN THEY'RE WRITINGNOW, THEY KNOW ENOUGH NOW TO
SAY "THE BUNGHOLE WHAT ABOUT --ERASE THAT.
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU,"LYNDON JOHNSON AND THE
AMERICAN DREAM," AVAILABLE ONeBOOKS AUGUST 4th.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, EVERYBODY.
