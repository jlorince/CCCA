ALL!  ANY TIME WE JUST WENT BACK
TO WHERE A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS
STARTED.
THE ORIGINAL SIN, THE BRITISH
MAN 100 YEARS AGO DRAWING A MAP
OF A PLACE HE NEVER HAD BEEN TO
FILLED WITH PEOPLE HE NEVER MET,
FORMING NEW COUNTRIES WITH NO
ATTENTION PAID TO ETHNIC RACE OR
TENSIONS.
>> I GIVE YOU SIR MAPS A,
ARCHIBALD MAPS A LOT III.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR!
>> ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE HERE,
JON!  NOW WHAT IS ALL THE BOTHER
ABOUT.
>> IT IS ACTUALLY AMOUNT THE
MIDDLE EAST, ARCHIBALD.
>> GHASTLY PLACE, HAVEN'T BEEN
THERE, DON'T WANT TO.
INDIA, THAT IS A PLAYING WORTH
SUBJUGATING.
>> Stewart: THE BORDER THAT
YOU DREW BACK AFTER WORLD WAR 1.
>> YEP.
>> Stewart: WELL, THEY HAVE
PROVEN TO BE A LITTLE UNSTABLE
AND SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL.
>> REALLY?  NOT A PROBLEM.
WE WILL JUST DRAW THEM AGAIN.
IN NOT A PROBLEM.
YES.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>> Stewart: THAT'S A PROBLEM.
YOU ARE A LITTLE CAVALIER ABOUT
THIS.
>> THIS TIME I WILL TAKE CARE.
A QUICK SCRIBBLE BEFORE YOU KNOW
IT, IT IS GIN O'CLOCK, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK.
YEP, YEP, I SEE YOUR PROBLEM
RIGHT HERE.
THE LINES ARE TOO SQUIGGLY.
>> AS MY FATHER ONCE TOLD ME
WHEN BORDERS GET SQUIGGLY,
PEOPLE GET SQUIGGLY, WHAT YOU
WANT IS A NICE STRAIGHT LINE,
JON, STRAIGHT AS YOU, CAN LIKE
THAT.
LOVELY.
LOVELY.
>> Stewart: WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
THOUGH YOU HAVE TAKEN SOME LAND
FROM TURKEY AND NOW A KURDISH
POPULATION IN A DISPUTED ZONE.
>> THAT IS A WHO LIVING IN A
WHERE, JON?  THIS IS
IMPERIALISM, BOY, FIRST RULE IS
DON'T OVER THINK IT, SECOND
RULE, DON'T THINK AT ALL!  CHECK
YOUR BRAIN AT THE DOOR WITH YOUR
BRAWLEY, THEY WILL LEARN TO LIVE
WITH IT AND IF NOT WHO REALLY
CARES.
SEE HOW EASY THIS IS, PUSH POSH,
PUT IN THE STRAIGHT, LOVELY AND
TAKE OUT THE JIGGLES, THERE YOU
GO, THERE YOU GO AND WE ARE
DONE, TIME FOR A NAUGHTY SHERRY
BECAUSE IF I KNOW ARABS, JON,
AND BELIEVE ME, I DO NOT -- THEY
LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN ALCOHOL
AFTER A GOOD WESTERN
INTERVENTION.
>> Stewart: WHAT YOU ARE DOING
THERE, SEE THAT IS TECHNICALLY
IRAN IS NOT ARAB.
THEY ARE PERSIAN.
>> WHAT?  PERSIAN?
>> Stewart: YES.
>> YOU ARE SAYING THEY ARE CATS?
>> Stewart: NO, I AM NOT.
>> CATS AND RUSSIAN LIVING SIDE
BY SIDE.
OH, IT WILL NEVER WORK, JON!
THEY ARE NATURAL ENEMIES.
>> Stewart: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I KNOW THAT CATS AND RUSSIAN ARE
NATURAL -- LOOK, THAT IS NOT
WHAT PERSIANS -- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TOUCH SAUDI ARABIA, BY THE WAY.
>> WHY TOUCH SAUDI ARABIA,
JONATHAN?  THEY ARE A GOOD
DECENT OIL PRODUCING PEOPLE!
>> Stewart: I DON'T THINK THIS
IS GOING TO WORK OUT.
>> LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING THE
ARABS RESPECT, JON, MORE THAN A
STRONG, STEADY WHITE HAND
DRAWING ARBITRARY LINES TO
THEIR, TO, AGAINST THEIR
RIDICULOUS TRIBAL ALLEGIANCES.
>> Stewart: THAT SEEMS A BUILT
RACIST.
>> YOU ARE CALLING ME A WHAT?
>> Stewart: THAT IS A BIT
RACIST.
> BA, BA, BA, STEADY THAT SHIP!
TO CALL ME RACIST WOULD BE TO
IMPLY I CARED ENOUGH TO HATE
THEM.
OH, OR, OR WITH A INTERESTING
MUST HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT THEM TO DISLIKE.
THAT'S IT.
>> Stewart: THAT IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF MINDLESS IMPERIALISM
THAT GOT US INTO THIS SITUATION.
YOUR CASUAL IGNORANCE HAS DOOMED
THE REGION TO EXIST IN A
PERPETUAL STATE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?  WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT
NOW?
>> I AM PLAYING POKER.
>> Stewart: WAIT!  WHY?  WHY?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stewart: WHY?
>> BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING ME,
JON.
AND THIS IS WHAT REAL GENTLEMEN
DO.
THEY PLAY POKER ON THEIR IPHONES
WHENEVER THEY BECOME
INEXPLICABLY BORED BY SOMETHING
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.
I BID YOU GOOD DAY, SIR.
>> Stewart: SIR ARCHIBALD --
>> I BID YOU GOOD DAY!
>> Stewart: SIR
