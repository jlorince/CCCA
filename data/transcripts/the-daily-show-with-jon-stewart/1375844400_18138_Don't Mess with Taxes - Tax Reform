CHICKEN POOP BURNING SO IF THE
TAX CODE NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND
THERE'S A BIPARTISAN DESIRE TO
FIX IT, WHY HASN'T ANYONE DONE
IT IN 27 YEARS?
>> THE REASON WE'RE NOT SEEING
MORE MEANINGFUL TAX REFORM IS
QUITE SIMPLY BECAUSE ALL OF THE
POLITICIANS ARE TERRIFIED TO
ALIENATE THE BASE THAT FUNDS
THEM.
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING BASICALLY
TO DO POLITICAL SUICIDE.
>> IT'S THAT THIRD RAIL OF THE
NEW YORK SUBWAY SYSTEM.
YOU GRAB AND YOU'RE ELECTROCUTED
JON IS IT JUST ME OR DOES
POLITICS SEEM TO HAVE A SURPLUS
OF THIRD RAILS, CERTAINLY WAY
MORE THAN THREE.
>> NATIONAL SECURITY HAS BECOME
BASICALLY THE THIRD RAIL IN
AMERICAN POLITICS.
>> THE POLITICS OF GUN
REGULATION ARE A THIRD RAIL.
>> SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE
SO-CALLED THIRD RAIL OF AMERICAN
POLITICS.
>> MEDICARE REFORM PACKAGE AND
OF COURSE THAT'S THE THIRD RAIL
OF POLITICS.
>> THE TRUE THIRD RAIL OF
AMERICAN POLITICS: PICKING A
FAVORITE SPORTS TEAM FROM
OUTSIDE YOUR STATE.
>> John: IT'S LIKE AMERICA'S
POLITICAL SYSTEM IS BUILT
ENTIRELY OUT OF THIRD RAILS.
IT'S WHY YOU CAN'T URINATE
ANYWHERE IN THE WASHINGTON D.C.
AREA WITHOUT GETTING
ELECTROCUTED.
THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S A FACT.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY SINGLE
PART OF THE TAX CODE IS IN THERE
BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTED IT TO BE.
IF YOU AS A POLITICIAN EVEN
CONSIDERED TAKING ONE OUT, ITS
BACKERS WILL MAKE YOU PAY.
SO YOU'VE GOT TO THINK TWICE
BEFORE GOING UP AGAINST BIG
HEDGE FUNDS, BIG OIL OR BIG
CHICKEN POOP.
THEY'LL GET YOU.
AND WHAT'S MORE IT'S PROBABLY
NOT JUST THEIR CURRENT JOBS THAT
LAWMAKERS ARE TRYING TO PROTECT.
IT'S ALSO THEIR MUCH MORE
LUCRATIVE FUTURE JOBS.
>> IN 1974, ONLY 3% OF RETIRING
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BECAME
LOBBYISTS.
TODAY THAT NUMBER IS 42% FROM
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND 50% FOR
SENATORS.
>> John: I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD
SAY THIS: BUT WASHINGTON REALLY
HAD SO MUCH MORE INTEGRITY BACK
IN THE WATERGATE ERA.
( APPLAUSE )
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS NOWADAYS
OUR LAWMAKERS ARE SO CHICKEN
[BLEEP] YOU COULD GET A TAX
BREAK FOR SETTING THEM ON FIRE.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
HERE'S THE CRAZY THING.
THEY'RE NOT WRONG TO BE SCARED.
WHICH IS WHY THE CREDIT MUST GO
HERE TO SENATORS BAUCUS AND
HATCH WHO ARE CURRENTLY TRYING
TO OVERHAUL THE TAX CODE FROM
SCRATCH.
THEY'VE COME UP WITH AN INGENIUS
PLAN TO ENCOURAGE THEIR
COLLEAGUES TO DO SOMETHING
APPROACHING THEIR JOBS.
>> LEADERS OF THE SENATE FINANCE
COMMITTEE HAVE PROMISED THEIR
FELLOW LAWMAKERS THAT ANY
SUGGESTIONS THEY MAKE ABOUT WHAT
DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS ARE
PRESERVED IN TAX REFORM WILL BE
KEPT SECRET FOR 50 YEARS.
>> John: THAT IS THE LAMEST TIME
CAPSULE EVER.
LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS FROM 2013.
WE GOT A SLEEN A GOMEZ CD.
SOMETHING CALLED A SNUGGIE AND,
OH, A 10-TO-1 SPENDING CUTS
DEAL.
IT'S ALL RETRO.
THIS IS HOW PARANOID THE
SENATORS ARE WITH THEIR
SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING THE
COUNTRY BETTER MIGHT LEAK OUT
AND THEREBY DESTROY THEIR
CAREERS.
THE 50-YEAR BALLOT OF SECRECY
WASN'T ENOUGH.
THEIR IDEAS AND OPINIONS WILL
EACH GET THEIR OWN I.D. NUMBER
AND BE STORED ON PASSWORD
PROTECTED SER SERVERS AND IN
LOCKED SAFES.
THOSE LOCKED SAFES WILL HAVE A
HANDLE MADE OF A DEADLY SPIDER
WHICH, EVEN IF YOU'RE BRAVE
