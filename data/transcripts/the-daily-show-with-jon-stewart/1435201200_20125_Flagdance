( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  HEY, WELCOME TO THEDAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT --BOOM!
OUR GUEST TONIGHT-- MAYBE, MAYBEMY FAVORITE JUDGE SINCE DREAD.
ANDREW NAPOLITANO IS GOING TO BEJOINING US ON THE PROGRAM
TONIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT FIRST, IT HAS BEGUN.
THE HORRIBLE ATTACK IN SOUTHCAROLINA SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED A
NATIONAL RE-EXAMINATION OF SOMEOF THE MORE VISIBLE SOUTHERN
SYMBOLS HONORING THAT TIME THATTHEY FOUGHT... US.
IT'S ACTUALLY APARTMENT OF OURNEW SEGMENT, HUH, I GUESS IT IS
PRETTY [BLEEP] WEIRD WE FLY AFLAG IN HONOR OF PRO-SLAVERY
SECESSIONIST ARMY.
MONDAY, SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNORNIKKI HALEY CALLED FOR THE
REMOVAL OF CONFEDERATE FLAG FROMHER STATE CAPITAL AND THEN IT
WAS ON.
>> THE CITADEL, THE MILITARYSCHOOL IN CHARLESTON HAS VOTED
REMOVE THE CONFEDERATE FLAG.
>> ALABAMA'S GOVERNOR REMOVEDTHE BATTLE FLAG FROM THE CIVIL
WAR MEMORIAL AT THE STATECAPITAL GROUNDS.
>> IN MISSISSIPPI, NEW CALLS FORTHAT STATE'S FLAG TO BE ALTERED.
IT FEATURES THE CONFEDERATEBATTLE FLAG IN THE CORNERS.
>> Jon:  OKAY, I'M FOR THEOTHERS, BUT MISSISSIPPI?
DON'T, YOU, DARE.
I DON'T LIKE OUTDATED OFFENSIVESYMBOLS OF RACE HATRED AS MUCH
AS THE NEXT GUY.
BUT WITHOUT THAT BATTLE FLAGYOU'RE SIDE WAYS FRANCE.
THAT'S [BLEEP] UP.
THAT'S JUST SAD.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
SO LISTEN, TAKING DOWN THE FLAGONLY--
TAKING DOWN THE FLAG ONLY150 YEARS AFTER THE SOUTH
SURRENDERED AND 20 YEARS AFTERNASCAR DID IT, CONGRATULATIONS,
SOUTH CAROLINA! FOR COMING INJUST TWO DECADES BEHIND
AMERICA'S FAVORITE CRASH-BASEDSPORT.
( LAUGHTER )
WHILE NIKKI HALEY MAY REPRESENTA NEW GENERATION IN SOUTH
CAROLINA, REMNANTS OF THEOLD GENERATION ALSO ARE
SUPPORTING THE MOVE.
>> I AM PROUD TO BE ON THE RIGHTSIDE OF HISTORY REGARDING THE
REMOVAL OF THIS SYMBOL OF RACISMAND BIGOTRY FROM THE STATE
HOUSE.
>> Jon:  TAKE THIS IN.
DRINK THAT IN.
FEEL THAT.
THAT'S PAUL THURMOND, SON OFARCH-SEGREGATIONIST STROM
THURMOND, SPEAKING OUT AGAINSTTHAT FLAG.
I MEAN, THAT-- THAT'S LIKE IFKOOL-AID MAN'S SON TOOK TO THE
FLOOR OF THE SENATE TO GIVE ALECTURE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF
WALL PRESERVATION.
JUST CAME DOWN THERE AND SAID,"WE CANNOT, WE CAN NO LONGER
KEEP DEMOLISHING THESE INNOCENTWALLS.
I LOVE MY FATHER, BUT ON THISISSUE, I SAY TO HIM 'OH, NO'."
( LAUGHTER )
YOU THINK WHEN HE WAS A KIDHE WOULD CALL HIS DAD AND BE
LIKE, DON'T COME TO THE RECITAL.
IT JUST CAUSES A LOT OFPROBLEMS."
EVEN THE C.E.O. OF THE COMPANYTHAT USED TO LOCK ITS EMPLOYEES
INSIDE OVERNIGHT IS JOINING TEAMANTI-SLAVE FLAG, AS YOU SEE IN
THIS INTERVIEW FROM I GUESS"WALMART AFTER DARK."
( LAUGHTER )
>> WERE YOU SHOCKED TO SEE THATKIND OF MERCHANDISE ON WALMART'S
PLATFORMS?
>> I WAS SURPRISED, YEAH.
>> Jon:  I MEAN, LOOK, IKNEW WE SOLD CHEAP GUNS, REALLY
CHEAP, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, TOANYBODY.
TREMENDOUS STOPPING POWER.
I MEAN, I TELL YOU YOU COME TOWALMART AND BUY SOME OF THOSE
GUNS, YOU COULD HAVE A HELL OF ASTANDOFF.
MY POINT IS THIS-- I DIDN'T KNOWYOU COULD GET THEM WITH THE
STARS AND BARS HOLE STERS.
THAT SENDS A VERY DANGEROUSMESSAGE.
AND AS WE KNOW AS WALMART GOES,SO GO OTHER WALMART-Y-LIKE
PLACES.
>> THE DEBATE OVER THECONFEDERATE FLAG IS GROWING.
>> SOME OF THE NATION'S BIGGESTRETAILERS WILL STOP SELLING
MERCHANDISE LIKE WALMART,TARGET, SEARS, AMAZON, EBAY,
AND ETSY.
>> Jon:  HOW THE [BLEEP] DIDETSY GET IN THERE?
WAIT.
WHAT?
I APOLOGIZE TO THE SOUTH.
THAT ONE IS OUR BAD.
AS NORTHEASTERN LIBERALELITISTS, WE'RE THE ONES WHO
SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICING ETSY.
I APOLOGIZE.
FROM NOW ON, I PROMISE YOUTHIS: NO MORE STEAMPUNK
HAND-CRAFTED CONFEDERATE BEARDKOOZIES.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
ALL APOLOGIES TO THOSE GREATREENACTORS OF THE 13th
WILLIAMSBURG REGIMENT NANOBREWERS.
LISTEN, IT IS BECOMING HARDERAND HARDER TO FIND PUBLIC
FIGURES WHO AREN'T SUDDENLY ONBOARD WITH AT LEAST CONSIDERING
DITCHING THIS ARCHAIC SYMBOL OFRACIST INSURRECTION, HARDER...
BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
>> ONE REPUBLICAN STATE SENATORLEE BRYCE OF SPARTANBURG IS
COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO THIS,CALLING THE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE
THE FLAG "A STALINIST PURGE."
>> Jon:  A LITTLE BIT OF AHYPE-- REMOVING A FLAG WOULD NOT
BE STALINIST PURGE STYLE.
STALIN, WHAT WOULD HE DO?
HE WOULD PROBABLY KEEPTHE FLAG, BUT WHITEWASH IT OF
ITS ASSOCIATIONS WITH SLAVERYAND SECESSION AND CONCOCT
SOME BIZARRE NARRATIVE ABOUT, ITACTUALLY REPRESENTS SOMETHING
LOVEABALE AND POSITIVE,SOMETHIGN YOU CAN SLAP  ON
THE BACK OF A T-SHIRT OR TRUCK.
AND THEN HE'D SAY THAT THIS NEWMEANING JUSTIFIES NOT JUST
KEEPING THE FLAG, BUT ELEVATINGIT, HONORING IT.
FORTUNATELY AMERICANS WOULDN'TFALL FOR SUCH STALINIST --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT.
BUT, AS OF THIS WILL WEEK, AS OFTHIS WEEK, PRO-CONFEDERATE FLAG
PUBLIC FIGURES NO LONGER SEEM TOBE IN THE MAIN STREAM TO GET AN
ACTUAL OUTRIGHT DEFENDER OF THEFLAG ON CAMERA, NEWS JUST HAVE
TO DIG DEEP.
>> ONCE THE FLAG IS REMOVED ITWILL START DOWN THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE, AND THEN THERE WILL BETHE MONUMENT WILL BE CALLED FOR
TO BE REMOVED FROM STATE HOUSEGROUNDS.
AND THEN THE NEXT THING WILL BESTREET NAMES, AND BUILDING
NAMES, WHICH IS ALREADY BEGUN.
>> Jon:  YEAH, UM, LET MEEXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE ARGUMENT USUALLY WORKS.
USUALLY WHEN YOU DO THE SLIPPERYSLOPE ARGUMENT, YOU LIKE TO END
IT IN SOMETHING BAD.
SO YOU DON'T GO, LIKE, YOU KNOWTHE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
GOING TO TAKE IT OFF THEBUILDING AND THEN THEY'RE GOING
TO TAKE IT OFF-- AND THE NEXTTHING BLACK CHILDREN WON'T HAVE
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOLS NAMESAFTER A MAN WHO WOULDN'T LET
THEM LEARN HOW TO READ?
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A WORLD YOUWANT TO BE A PART OF?
NOT THAT SOME DEFENDERS OFSTARS AND BARS DON'T FORESEE
SOME OMINOUS OUTCOMES.
>> ONE DAY VERY SOON, I PREDICTTHEY WILL COME AFTER ANOTHER
FLAG, THE ONE WITH BROAD STRIPESAND BRIGHT STARS.
AND DON'T BE TERRIBLY SURPRISEDWHEN EVEN REPUBLICANS STAND IDLY
BY AS THEY BURN THE STARSPANGLED BANNER.
>> Jon:  I DON'T THINK WEWILL.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
BACK TO YOU, TODD.
I'D LIKE TO SAY HE'S BEINGHYPERBOLIC HERE, BUT-- BUT IF
I'M BEING HONEST WITH MYSELF, IDO REMEMBER THERE BEING A
PRECEDENT FOR A GROUP OF ANGRYPEOPLE COMING FOR THE AMERICAN
FLAG.
AND THEY HAD, I REMEMBER SOMEMILITARY FORCE BEHIND THEM.
WHO WERE THOSE ANGRY P.C.LIBEARLS AGAIN, COMING FOR
OUR FLAGS?
THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS THOSE( BLEEP ) GUYS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE'S ONE ARGUMENT FLAGSUPPORTERS TURN TO MORE THAN ANY
OTHER.
>> SOME HAVE SAID FOR YEARS THEFLAG IS ABOUT SOUTHERN PRIDE,
HERITAGE.
>> I BELIEVE IT REPRESENTSHISTORY AND HERITAGE.
>> ALL OF MY ANCESTORS FOUGHTFOR THE SOUTH.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE.
>> Jon:  NO, THAT'S THEWHOLE POINT.
THEY FOUGHT FOR THE SOUTH,AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
BECAUSE OF SLAVERY.
THAT'S THE HERITAGE YOU'REDEFENDING.
LOOK, I'M SURE YOUR SOLDIERANCESTORS HAD OTHER REDEEMING
QUALITIES, BUT THIS IS THE THINGTHEY'RE KNOWN FOR.
IT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING YOUSUPPORT FLYING THE NAZI FLAG
BECAUSE YOU'RE PROUD OF THEIRROBUST ANTISMOKING AGENDA, BUT
THAT WASN'T REALLY THEIR THING.
AND I THINK THAT'S THE REALPROBLEM HERE.
WHAT SOUTHERN PEOPLE NEED IS AFLAG THAT REPRESENTS THE ASPECTS
OF THEIR HERITAGE THAT WE CANALL CELEBRATE.
FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S TRY THIS ONE.
HERE'S A FLAG COMMEMORATING THECREATION OF BARBECUE.
THAT'S HOW BARBECUE WAS PROBABLYINVENTED, AN INGENIOUS
SOUTHERNER SAW A PIG ON FIRE ANDTHOUGHT, I CAN WORK WITH THIS.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW IT'S GREAT THAT THECONFEDERATE FLAG SEEMS TO BE
FINALLY FALLING OUT OFFLAVOR-- FAVOR-- FLAVOR.
( LAUGHTER )
I'M SORRY.
I'M STILL THINKING ABOUTBARBECUE, I APOLOGIZE.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S A TASTY SAUCE.
BUT THIS IS REALLY SYMBOLIC.
IT'S A SMALL PART OF A MUCHLARGER PROBLEM.
IDEALLY, THIS DEBATE IS ONLY THESTART OF A LONGER CONVERSATION,
ADDRESSING THE KIND OFINSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEMIC
RACISM THAT WE HAVE YET TODISASSEMBLE, THAT CONTINUES TO
THIS VERY DAY.
>> ARE THERE INDIVIDUAL RACISTIN THIS COUNTRY.
>> OF COURSE.
>> SADLY, YES.
DOES INSTITUTIONAL RACISM EXISTANYMORE?
NO, IT DOES NOT?
>> Jon:  OH, WELL I GUESSTHE CONVERSATION WAS SHORTER
THAN I EXPECTED.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, GREAT JOB, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
