TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?
[LAUGHTER]
UNLESS YOU BELIEVE WE ARE CHERRY PICKING FLOOR DEBATES LOWLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTING THE MORALITY
ARGUMENTS WE'LL HAVE JUSTICE KAGAN READ FROM THE SUMMARY OF DELIBERATION IN 1996 TO SEE IF
THE WRITERS OF DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT DID SO WITH MORAL INTENT.
>> I'M GOING TO QUOTE FROM THE HOUSE REPORT HERE IS THAT CONGRESS DECIDED TO REFLECT AND
HONOR A COLLECTIVE MORAL JUDGMENT AND TO EXPRESS MORAL DISAPPROVAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY.
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN 1996?
>> DOES THE HOUSE REPORT SAY THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: DOES IT -- IS THAT WHAT IT SAYS?
IF IT PLEASES THE COURT, I'D LIKE TO WIPE MY BROW COMICALLY NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OOOOH, PERHAPS APPROACH THE BENCH --
[LAUGHTER]
BUT WITH MORAL ARGUMENTS NO LONGER AVAILABILITY TO OPPONENTS OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WHAT IS
LEFT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES TO ARGUE?
LET'S LET JUSTICE SCALIA TAKE A CRACK AT IT.
>> IF YOU REDEFINE MARRIAGE TO SAME SEX COUPLES YOU MUST PERMIT ADOPTION BY SAME SEX COUPLES.
>> Jon: EVERYTHING SOUNDS SO FAR.
THIS SAY DISAGREEMENT AMONG SOCIOLOGISTS AS TO WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF RAISING A CHILD
IN THE SEX OF A -- IN A SINGLE SEX FAMILY WHETHER IT'S HARMFUL TO THE CHILD OR NOT.
>> Jon: MAY I APPROACH THE GRINCH, DICK SHALL BENCH, BENCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE ISN'T DISAGREEMENT.
THE AMERICAN ACAD-PEED ATTICS SAY THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP WEB PARENTS SEXUAL OR YENATION OR
CHILDREN'S WELL BEING.
AND SECOND OF ALL IF THE NEW STANDARD FOR RECOGNIZING MARRIAGE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE
COUPLE WOULD MAKE GOOD PARENTS, YOU ANTONIN SCALIA SHOULD GET CABLE BECAUSE -- IT LOOKS
LIKE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE CONSEQUENCES -- THE CONSEQUENCES OF HETEROSEXUAL CHILD REARING
ARE PRETTY SEVERE AND THOSE ARE JUST THE HETEROS THAT LET PEOPLE FILM THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO HETEROSEXUALED ARE ALLOWED TO BE (bleep) PARENTS.
WHAT IS THE NEXT ARGUMENT.
>> SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS VERY NEW.
I THINK IT WAS FIRST ADOPTED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN 2000 SO THERE ISN'T A LOT OF DATA ABOUT ITS SUCCESS.
YOU WANT US TO STEP IN AND RENDER A DECISION ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THIS INSTITUTION
NEWER THAN CELL PHONES OR THE INTERNET?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NO WE WANT TO YOU RENDER A DECISION BASED ON WHETHER IT'S RIGHT AND FAIR AND
JUST UNDER THE CONSTITUTION HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS NEWNESS AND WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT HAPPEN.
WHICH BY THE WAY WHAT DO YOU THINK MIGHT SNAP THAT THEY DISCOVER LETTING TWO LADIES GET
MARRIED WILL RIP OPEN A HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER.
GAY MARRIAGE WILL CAUSE LESS NATIONAL HARM THAN CELL PHONES OR THE INTERNET.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE IS THE THING THAT I'M PRETTY SURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BETA TEST RIGHT.
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE ONLY BEEN HERE 50 YEARS.
LET'S SEE HOW THE NETHERLANDS DOES WITH THEM BEFORE WE LIFT THE BEARERS.
WHILE THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS ARE CLEARLY FASCINATING, I WONDER IF THERE WAS A MORE HUMAN ELEMENT
IN ALL THAT THIS COULD DEMYSTIFY THE ISSUE FOR THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES.
>> AT THE HEART OF THIS CASE IS THE STORY OF THESE WOMEN.
IT'S A STORY THAT SPANS 40 YEARS.
THIS IS HOW LONG EDIE WINCER WAS WITH HER PARTNER.
>> WHEN MY BEAUTIFUL SPARKLING PARTNER DIED FOUR YEARS AGO.
I WAS OVER COME WITH GRIEF.
I REALIZED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS TREATING US AS STRANGERS.
>> Jon: INCREDIBLY ADORABLE WOMAN GRIEVING THE LOSS OF HER SPOUSE IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY
EXCEPT IN THE EYES OF THE LAW.
CAN WE JUST MOVE TO JUSTICE?
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE NOT.
THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT I THINK THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES WILL GET HIT HOME WITH.
>> WHEN SPIRE PASSED AWAY SHE WAS HIT WITH A $360,000 FEDERAL ESTATE TAX BILL MONEY SHE WOULD
NOT HAVE TO PAID IF HE IS SHE WAS MARRIED TO A MAN.
>> Jon: (bleep) INJUSTICE THE RIGHT MAY NOT RECOGNIZE TRUE LOVE BUT THEY RECOGNIZE THE
HEARTBREAK THAT IS DOUBLE TAXATION.
