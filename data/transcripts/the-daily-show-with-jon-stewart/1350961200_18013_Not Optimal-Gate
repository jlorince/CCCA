[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
>> JON: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
TONIGHT'S GUEST, MY FRIEND DL HUGHLEY WILL BE JOINING US, BUT FIRST, LAST NIGHT, NIGHT OF TOO MANY STARS.
THANKS TO EVERYBODY FOR WATCHING AND DONATING.
A GREAT NIGHT.
YOU SEE THAT BEAUTIFUL SET FOR "NIGHT OF TOO MANY STARS"?
CAN WE SHOW THAT?
THAT BEAUTIFUL SET WAS HERE.
IT WAS HERE.
DO YOU SEE, WHERE I'M SITTING RIGHT NOW?
LAST NIGHT IN THIS ROOM.
NOW IT'S NOT HERE.
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY IT'S NOT HERE?
BECAUSE "THE DAILY SHOW" CREW ARE [BLEEPED] SET ELVES.
THEY ARE MAGIC.
THEY WORKED ALL NIGHT LONG TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
GIVE THESE PEOPLE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
UNBELIEVABLE.
ANYWAY, IT'S BEEN A BIG WEEK.
ON THURSDAY WE HAD ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS, AND THIS IS THE TRUTH, GOLDIE HAWN HAD BEEN SCHEDULED.
[LAUGHTER]
A LAST-MINUTE CONFLICT.
SO SINCE THE PRESIDENT WAS ALREADY IN TOWN FOR A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED TRAFFIC LOGJAM, HE STOPPED BY FOR A 12-MINUTE, YOU
KNOW, [BLEEPED], FEATURING ALL THE STANDARDS, SOLID BIDEN IN A WET BATHING SUIT GAG, A COUPLE, WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU
IN THE FIRST DEBATE ZINGERS.
YEAH, THOSE ARE REAL, BABY.
GOOD OLD HOUSING HAPPEN.
REFERENCE, A SMATTERING OF SOME SOBER REFLECTION, AS WELL, CONCERNING LIBYA.
I WOULD SAY EVEN YOU WOULD ADMIT IT WAS NOT THE OPTIMAL RESPONSE, AT LEAST TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS FAR AS US ALL BEING ON THE
SAME PAGE.
>> WELL, HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY.
>> JON: YEAH?
>> IF FOUR AMERICANS GET KILLED, IT'S NOT OPTIMAL.
>> Jon: GUESS WHICH PART OF THAT LIT UP THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA COMPLEX?
BIDEN.
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
NOT RIGHT.
AH, IT WAS HASH TAG "NOT OPTIMAL." BY 10:00 P.M.'S "ON THE RECORD" WITH GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, SENATOR
JOHN MCCAIN EXPRESSED HIS DEEP AND IN NO WAY OPPORTUNISTIC DISAPPOINTMENT.
>> EVEN FROM SOMEONE LIKE THE PRESIDENT, WHO HAS NEVER KNOWN WHAT THESE KINDS OF TRAGEDIES ARE ABOUT AND THE SERVICE AND
SACRIFICE THAT PEOPLE MAKE, IT IS STILL JUST, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN GET ANGRY.
IT'S JUST SO INAPPROPRIATE.
AND I'M SURE THAT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE BRAVE AMERICANS ARE NOT AMUSED.
>> jON: I CAN TELL HOW NOT ANGRY YOU ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
STRONG AND DEFINITIVE CONDEMNATION FROM MCCAIN OF AN INTERVIEW THE SENATOR COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN AS IT DIDN'T
AIR UNTIL ONE HOUR LATER.
AND I'M PRETTY SURE McCAIN STOPPED WATCHING THIS SHOW...
[LAUGHTER]
[WHISPERING]
SO TO SEE THE SENATOR COMMIT TO SOMETHING WITHOUT FIRST PROPERLY VETTING IT WAS REALLY, WELL, YEAH, OKAY.
I GUESS THAT WAS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK JOKES LIKE THAT ARE PROBABLY WHY HE STOPPED WATCHING.
ANYWAY, I FIGURE GIVE CONSERVATIVES A NIGHT TO SLEEP ON IT.
SEE THE INTERVIEW IN CONTEXT.
PERHAPS THE REACTION WILL BE LESS KNEE-JERK.
>> "NOT OPTIMAL"?
SOME PEOPLE AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
>> THAT IS AN EMBARRASSING WORD FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO USE.
>> THIS SHOULDN'T BE EXPLOITED.
IT'S A NATIONAL TRAGEDY.
>> COLD AND CALLOUS, THE CLINICAL LANGUAGE, COLD.
I WOULD SAY TRAGIC.
>> Jon: WOW.
IT'S STILL JERK, BUT I GUESS LESS KNEE.
SEE, I THOUGHT THE TONE AND CONTEXT OF THE CONVERSATION IN NOW WAY REFLECTED A PRESIDENT DISMISSIVE OF THE GRAVITY OF
WHAT HAPPENED IN LIBYA.
BUT I GUESS CONSERVATIVES WOULDN'T BE SATISFIED UNLESS THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY LABELED BENGHAZI A TRAGIC EVENT, AS
BARNEY SUGGESTED.
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE TO BE REALLY CLEAR.
YOU KNOW, HE'D HAVE TO SAY THE WORD "TRAGIC EVENT." HE'D HAVE TO SAY IT LIKE 20 SECONDS PRIOR TO "NOT OPTIMAL."
>> NOBODY IS MORE INTERESTED IN FIGURING THIS OUT THAN I AM.
WHEN A TRAGIC EVENT LIKE THIS HAPPENS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD...
