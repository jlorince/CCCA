HEISTS BUT BY MISTAKE THEY STEALTHIS LITTLE ROBOT,
THIS CONSCIOUS ROBOT -- >> Jon: CHAPPIE. YES.
>> WHO THEY NAME CHAPPIEAND THEY TRY TO TEACH HIM
TO BE LIKE A YOU KNOW, LIKE ARAPPER AND A GANGSTER,
AND IT'S AWESOME.
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE TYPE OFTHING -- SEE, I LOVE ANYTHING
THAT INTERSECTS WITH THIS IDEA.
SO IT'S LIKE A NATURE-NURTURE.>> YES, EXACTLY.
>> Jon: THE IDEA OF, SO WHAT ISCONSCIOUSNESS?
WHAT IS ALL THAT?
AND IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TOROBOTS WITH WEAPONS. IT ALWAYS,
THAT ULTIMATELY, THAT'S WHEREWE'RE GOING AS A PEOPLE.
>> YES, AND HE USES NINJA STARSIN A WAY THAT I CAN'T.
I CAN, I USE OTHER WEAPONS WELL,FAKE WEAPONS, BUT NOT THAT.
>> Jon: DOES THE ROBOT REALLYUSE NINJA STARS?
>> HE REALLY DOES.
>> Jon: YOU WOULD THINK AROBOT COULD DO BETTER THAN NINJA
STARS. YOU WOULD THINK --
>> BUT HE, HE DOESN'T REALIZEHE'S HURTING PEOPLE, YOU SEE.
SO HE HAS LOTS OF BLING AND HEHAD ACTUALLY SHARLTO COPLEY WHO
PLAYS HIM WHEN THE LITTLE SHORTSTHAT ARE FALLING OFF OVER HIS
MOTION CAPTURE SUIT.

>> YES, THAT'S WHAT SO AM --BRILLIANTLY PLAYED BY
SHARLTO COPLEY WHO IS THE STAROF DISTRICT 9.
>> Jon: THAT'S AMAZING.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU AND THEDIRECTOR WORK ON THIS,
IS HE FASCINATED BY THISROBOT DILEMMA?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I GUESS THEREARE TWO KINDS OF A.I.
ONE PEOPLE AREN'T THAT WORRIEDABOUT WHICH IS THE A.G.I.,
WHICH IS GENERAL INTELLIGENCE,WHICH IS ROBOTS WHO ARE
GOING TO BE HELPFUL AND WHO CANLIKE WIN ON JEOPARDY
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN THERE'S A.S.I. WHICHIS THE SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE
THAT WILL OUTRUN US AND WE'LL BELIKE CHIMPS TO THEIR
INTELLIGENCE, ANDPEOPLE LIKE BILL GATES THINK
PERHAPS THAT THIS ISDANGEROUS AND WE
MIGHT BECOME EXTINCT AND THEROBOTS WILL TAKE OVER, BUT I AM
LOOKING FORWARD TO ROBOTS MYSELFPERSONALLY.
I WANT A LITTLE CHAPPIE IN MYKITCHEN, YOU KNOW.
I DO.
SO I'M NOT WORRIED. I'M NOTWORRIED.
>> Jon: YEAH, WELL LET ME ASKYOU THIS.
>> OKAY.
>> Jon: BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF MYRUMBA, SO HOW --
IS THAT A.G.I. OR IS THAT A.S.I.AND HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO BEING
THE CHIMPS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP?
>> WELL, THERE ARE DIFFERENTESTIMATES OF THE TIME.
I THINK SOME PEOPLE SAY 2025,2050.
>> Jon: OH, OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
>> YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW, WE'LLBE FINE.
BY THEN WE'LL BE USING OURNINJA STARS AND WE'LL BE FINE.
>> Jon: THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT, FORME THAT WILL BE FINE.
I'LL JUST BE, LIKE, CHAPPIE,CHANGE ME!
(LAUGHTER) LIKE IT WILL BE FINE.
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA, I'M NOTEVEN GONNA CARE AT THAT POINT.
HERE'S MY POINT ABOUT THE ROBOTSAND ALL THAT -- IN ANY OF THESE
DYSTOPIAN TYPE NOVELS, EVERYTIME MAN MAKES SOMETHING THAT WE
BELIEVES WILL BE HELPFUL TO US,BE BENEFICIAL,
WE DON'T SEE THEUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
AND IT BECOMES OURPRISON AND OUR DOOM, AND I THINK
THESE ROBOTS -- YOU KNOW,BECAUSE WE'RE IN A VERY
INTERESTING POINT RIGHT NOW.
CHIMPS COULD TAKE US OVER.
WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE MOVIES.>> THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: NOT CHIMPS, APES, ISHOULD SAY.
>> YES. YEAH.
>> Jon: CHIMPS I DON'T THINKWOULD DO IT. APES COULD.
AND NOW ROBOTS COULD.
SO WE'RE REALLY STUCK BETWEEN AROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
>> THEY MAY IMPROVE, THEYIMPROVE ON US.
YOU KNOW, WE KEEP MAKING THESAME MISTAKES AND HAVING WARS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
THEY MAY BE MORE INTELLIGENT ANDRATIONAL THAN WE ARE.
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING.
>> Jon: THAT ONE LADY IN THEAUDIENCE ALMOST --
>> WELL, I PAID HER! (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MYFAVORITE THING EVER AS YOU SAID,
YOU KNOW, WELL MAYBE THEY WILLIMPROVE ON THAT THAT LADY WAS
LIKE...
(LAUGHTER)>> YES.
>> Jon: OH NO, THEY'LLFIND OUT I'M A ROBOT,
NOW WHAT DO I DO? VERY EXCITING.
>> WE'LL HAVE TO RE-PROGRAM HER.
>> Jon: AND YOU WERE, I'MJUST GOING TO SAY,
CAN I SAY, YOU WERE JUST INRUSSIA FOR A LITTLE BIT
PROMOTING THE FILM -->> YES.
>> Jon: AND YOU THINKTHEY WILL RESPOND WELL TO THIS
AND NOT GET ANY IDEAS, ANY CRAZYIDEAS?
>> WELL, FOR ALL I KNOW, THEJOURNALIST WHO IS INTERVIEWED ME
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ROBOTS. I DON'TKNOW.
>> Jon: DON'T THEY, DO YOU HAVEPEOPLE WHO CHECK?
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE A --
>> I HAVE A LITTLE ROBOT DOGWHO GOES OVER AND SNIFFS THEM.
>> Jon: I WOULD HAVE A POKER,JUST SOMEBODY TO GO IN AND
BE LIKE, YEAH,THAT'S A PERSON.
>> I'LL DO THAT NEXT TIME I GO.

ARE YOU STILL ON MOSCOW -->> NO, I FEEL GOOD.
I'M GOING OUT DANCING NOW.
