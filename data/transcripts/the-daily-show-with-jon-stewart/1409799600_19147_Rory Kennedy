>> I BORROWED A TRUCK, AND IBASICALLY SENT THE SIGNAL TO MY
FOLKS. THIS MEANTA GROUP OF SOUTH VIETNAMESE
MAJORS, LIEUTENANT COLONELS,COLONELS AND THEIR FAMILIES
TO MUSTER AN ADDRESS IN DOWNTOWNSAIGON.
I DROVE DOWN THERE.
THEY LOADED UP ONTO THE TRUCK.
AND I DROVE THEM TO THE AIRBASE. AND I HAD TOLD THEM,
WHEN YOU HEAR THREE THUMPS, THATMEANS HOLD
THE BABIES' MOUTHS, DON'TBREATHE, DON'T TALK, DON'T MAKE
ANY NOISE BECAUSE WE'RE GOINGTHROUGH THE GATE POST.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME RORYKENNEDY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HELLO.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: FABULOUS.
FABULOUS FILM.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THIS IS ABOUT THEEVACUATION OF SAIGON. YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONE OF THE LESSER-KNOWNEPISODES OF THE VIETNAM WAR.
>> WELL, IT'S... YOU KNOW, ITHINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
FAMILIAR WITH THE ICONIC IMAGEOF THE HELICOPTER...
>> Jon: YES.
>> ON TOP OF WHAT PEOPLE THINKIS THE EMBASSY.
IT'S, IN FACT, NOT THE EMBASSY.
AND THE DESPERATION OF THEVIETNAMESE TRYING TO LEAVE
DURING THOSE FINAL HOURS, ANDWHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS WE HAD
APPEASED IN 1973.
A PEACE ACCORD WAS SIGNED.
WE NO LONGER HAD TROOPS.
THIS IS NOW APRIL OF '75.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE NORTH COME IN.
THE COUNTRY FALLS WITHIN FOURMONTHS BECAUSE THE U.S. PRESENCE
ISN'T THERE.
AND IT FALLS MUCH QUICKER THANANYBODY EXPECTED.
SO IT BECAME VERY DESPERATE.
THE U.S. DECIDED WE JUST GOT TOGET THE AMERICANS OUT.
AND LEAVE ALL OUR VIETNAMESECOUNTERPARTS BEHIND.
>> Jon: AND THEY'VE SURROUNDEDSAIGON.
>> THEY'VE SURROUNDED -->> Jon: BUT IN THE PEACE
ACCORDS, THEY HAD PROMISED NOTTO DO THIS.
>> THEY HAD PROMISED NOT TO, BUTTHEY BROKE THE PEACE ACCORD, AND
THE U.S. HAD PROMISED... NIXONHAD PROMISED THE U.S. WILL COME
IN IF THE NORTH ATTACKS, ANDTHEN, OF COURSE, NIXON HAD
RESIGNED WITH WATERGATE.
FORD WAS IN OFFICE.
WE HAD PUT A CONGRESS INPOSITION WHERE THEY REALLY
DIDN'T SUPPORT THE WAR INVIETNAM.
AS A COUNTRY WE DIDN'T SUPPORTTHE WAR, AND WE JUST WEREN'T
GOING TO GET BEHIND GETTING BACKINTO THE QUAGMIRE OF VIETNAM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO THERE WAS NO SUPPORTBY THE U.S., AND THEY JUST WERE
ABLE TO KIND OF... IT FELL LIKEA HOUSE OF CARDS.
>> Jon: IT'S AMAZING HOWUNITED STATES' HISTORY EXISTS IN
SUCH SINGULAR FASHION, AND YOUNEVER SEE A CYCLE OF THESE TYPES
OF...
>> NEVER REPEATS ITSELF?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: THIS IS WHAT'S
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS,MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE,
SO THERE ARE... THE PEOPLE THATARE WORKING IN SAIGON,
THE AMERICANS HAVE THESEENORMOUS SUPPORT TEAMS OF
VIETNAMESE WHO HAVE RISKEDTHEIR LIVES TO WORK WITH US.
>> WELL, EXACTLY.
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE MANY PEOPLEHAD BEEN THERE OVER YEARS AND
YEARS.
AND THEY HAD, YOU KNOW, SOLDIERSHAD MARRIED VIETNAMESE.
THEY HAD CHILDREN WHO WEREVIETNAMESE. THEY HAD THEIR
COUNTERPARTS WHO THEY HAD BEENWORKING WITH, AND IT'S ANYBODY
FROM, YOU KNOW, AGENTS TO COOKSAND PEOPLE WHO DROVE THE CAR,
ALL OF WHOM WERE THEN A GREATERRISK BECAUSE THEN,
YOU KNOW, WE LEAVE THE COUNTRY,WE LEAVE THEM THERE THERE.
THEY'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THEAMERICANS, AND THEN THEY'RE AT
RISK FOR, YOU KNOW, BEINGTORTURED, BEING KILLED AND BEING
PUT INTO THESE REEDUCATIONCAMPS, AS THEY WERE CALLED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO THEY'RE VERYVULNERABLE AND, YOU KNOW, TO ME
I THINK WE HAVE A REALRESPONSIBILITY.
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT THEFILM DOCUMENTS IS THE AMERICANS
WHO ARE ON THE GROUND WHO WENTAGAINST U.S. POLICY...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND SAID, YOU KNOW, WE
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S ONLYAMERICANS GETTING OUT OF THIS
COUNTRY, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TOLEAVE THESE GUYS BEHIND, AND
THEY COMMITTED, YOU KNOW, WHATWAS REALLY ILLEGAL ACTS TO GET
THE VIETNAMESE OUT.
AND, IT'S REALLY A CELEBRATIONOF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE ON
THE FRONT LINES OF THIS.
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY IN THISSITUATION DESPITE BEST EFFORTS
OF REALLY GOOD PEOPLE WORKINGHARD, PEOPLE WERE LEFT BEHIND.
WHAT IS THAT LIKE NOW?
DO THEY TRY AND CONTACT, YOUKNOW, WHAT ARE THE STORIES OF
THE SURVIVORS?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS ISALL... THIS FILM IS IN THE
CONTEXT OF LOSING A WAR ANDABANDONING A HUGE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE, SO --
>> Jon: SO IT'S LIKE A ROM COM.
>> THAT'S ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUTIT.
BUT, SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S,THAT'S THE CONTEXT OF IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND BUT WITHIN THAT THERE ARETHESE EXTRAORDINARY,
HEROIC STORIES, AND WHATHAPPENED TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
LEFT BEHIND IS THEY DID END UPIN THESE RESETTLEMENT CAMPS,
REEDUCATION CAMPS ASTHEY WERE CALLED,
A MILLION PEOPLE, AND SOME OFTHEM WERE ABLE TO
ESCAPE AND EVENTUALLY COME TOTHE UNITED STATES, SO
WE NOW HAVE ABOUT TWO MILLIONVIETNAMESE HERE IN THE COUNTRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> MANY OF WHOM, YOU KNOW, HAVECOME OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS AND
A LOT OF WHOM CAME INTHE '70s AND 80s.
ABOUT 130,000 COME DURING THECOURSE OF THE STORY WE DOCUMENT
IN THIS FILM.
>> Jon: RIGHT. YOU MENTIONED,THOUGH,
THAT WHEN YOU SCREENEDTHE FILM, THERE WERE SOME OF THE
AMERICANS THAT HAD BEEN THERETHAT HAD TRIED VERY HARD, BUT
THERE WERE ALSO SOME VIETNAMESETHERE.
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE WHEN THEY GOTTOGETHER?
>> WELL, IT WAS REALLYINCREDIBLE.
THE FILM PREMIERED AT THESUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL, AND
IT WAS FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN ITIN THE THEATER OR ANYBODY HAD.
WE INVITED A NUMBER OF THEPEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE FILM TO
COME SEE IT. SO THEY HAD SEEN ITFOR THE FIRST TIME. AND IT WAS,
YOU KNOW, AN AUDIENCE OF 700PEOPLE, AND THEY CAME UP AND IT
WAS A REALLY WONDERFUL MOMENT OFSTANDING OVATIONS AND WHAT NOT,
BUT ON THE STAGE WAS STUHARRINGTON...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WHO, YOU KNOW, YOU SAW IN
THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW, ANDHE HAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY IN
THE FILM BECAUSE HE'S VERYHEROIC, BUT HE ALSO HAS THIS
MOMENT WHERE HE'S IN THEEMBASSY WHERE THE
DECISION... THERE'S ABOUT2,000 PEOPLE IN THE EMBASSY.
BY 4:00 A.M., THEY'VE GOTTENABOUT 1,600 PEOPLE OUT, BUT
THERE ARE 400 PEOPLE LEFTBEHIND.
HE'S THEN TOLD THEY'RE NOTSENDING ANY MORE HELICOPTERS.
SO HE THEN TELLS THESE PEOPLE,AND HE SPEAKS VIETNAMESE, WE'RE
GOING TO SAVE YOU.
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE,AND THEN HE LEAVES AND HE HIDES
AND HE GOES UP TO THE TOP OF THEEMBASSY AND HE GETS IN A
HELICOPTER AND HE LEAVES.
AND HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE 420PEOPLE HE LEFT BEHIND, AND HE'S
HEARTBROKEN, AND HE SAYS, "THISIS WRONG," YOU KNOW, AND HOW IT
WAS A NUTSHELL OFAMERICAN POLICY.
BUT AT SUNDANCE, ONE OF THE 420WHO WAS LEFT BEHIND WAS ON STAGE
WITH HIM, AND HE SAID ON STAGE,"I'VE LIVED IN FEAR OF RUNNING
INTO ONE OF THE 420," AND SO BENFO, WHO WAS ONE OF THE GUYS LEFT
BEHIND, GRABBED THE MIC AND HESAID, "STU, I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I FORGIVE YOU."
AND IT WAS THIS REALLYEXTRAORDINARY MOMENT.
>> Jon: YEAH. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.>> YEAH.
>> AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MOVINGLOOK AT PART OF OUR HISTORY THAT
I'M SURE WE'VE ALREADYFORGOTTEN.
[LAUGHTER]SO, REALLY, REALLY WELL DONE.
