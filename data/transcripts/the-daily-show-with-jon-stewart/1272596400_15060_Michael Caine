>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE LEDGE TKPWEPBD -- LEGEND AND ACADEMY AWARD WINNING ACTOR.
HIS LATEST FILM IS "HARRY BROWN."
>> TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SUBWAY.
HE'S A MATE.
YOUR MATE IS MURDERED.
SO WHAT HAPPENED, SON?
>> HE CHANGED IT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[SOBBING]
>> TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO LEONARD.
>> (bleep) OFF.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW MICHAEL CAINE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, JON.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS MOVIE "MARRY BROWN" A
GENTLEMAN LIVING IN A DIFFICULT CRIME RIDDEN AREA.
IN THE 70s IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAD A SERIES OF THESE MOVIES LIKE THE CHARLES BRONSON SORT
OF -- THEY WERE SO GREAT AND THEN THEY DISAPPEARED.
THEY WERE THESE GREAT WISHFUL FILM OF FANTASIES OF PEOPLE WHO FELT DEPRESSED.
IS THIS THE NEW WAVE NOW?
ARE YOU THE NEW BRONSON.
>> NO.
>> Jon: DID YOU KNOW BRONSON?
>> I DID KNOW CHARLIE.
WHEN HE DID DEATH WISH HE DID IT AS THOUGH HE ENJOYED IT.
THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT AN OLD MAN LIVING ON WHAT WE CALL AN HE ESTATE YOU CALL THE PROJECTS.
THEY KILLED HIS BEST FRIEND AND HE'S AN OLD MARINE WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS HOW TO DO STUFF BUT HE
DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO DO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE LOSES HIS TEMPER --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I THINK THAT WAS VERY APPARENT IN THE CLIP.
>> DON'T FOOL AROUND WITH ME,
I'M TELLING YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT TAKE.
ACTUALLY THOSE MOVIES, THE DEATH WISH MOVIES THEY SORT OF CELEBRATED VIOLENCE.
>> Jon: THERE WAS AN AIR OF LIKE THEY TOOK HIS FAMILY AND NOW HE WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT TO
GAIN REVENGE.
>> WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT BECAUSE --
[LAUGHTER]
I CAN'T DO THAT VOICE ANY WAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE ARE MORE LIKE THE POLICEMEN SAYING -- HE SAID THERE'S FOUR OF THEM DEAD AND THEY SAY HARRY BROWN.
HE SAID WAIT A MINUTE, THIS GUY IS AN OLD AGE MAN DYING OF EMPHYSEMA.
NO ONE BELIEVES IT.
WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT IS AN INNOCENT OLD PERSON WHO BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE IS DRIVEN TO
VIOLENCE HIMSELF.
IT'S -- YOU REMEMBER THE MOVIE "CLOCKWORK ORANGE."
>> Jon: SURE.
>> I WAS GOING TO CALL THIS MOVIE "THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE IS HERE."
IT'S NOT THE FUTURE ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW?
>> Jon: YOU GREW UP ACTUALLY IN THE ESTATES.
>> IF YOU SEE THE FILM, AND I HOPE YOU WILL.
IT'S ON THE PROJECTS.
>> Jon: YOU SHOULD SEE IT.
IT'S GREAT.
HE IS UNBELIEVABLE IN IT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THANK YOU, JON.
YEAH, BUT NO IN THE ACTUAL PROJECTS YOU SEE IN THE BLOCKS OF APARTMENTS ON THE SIDE THERE
ON THE WALL AT THE ENTRANCE THERE'S A MURAL ME ON IT BECAUSE I CAME FROM THERE.
ACTUALLY THERE.
I USED TO -- WE HAD THESE REAL GANGS IN THE MOVIE.
I USED TO SIT THERE.
WE WERE OUT THERE ALL NIGHT.
I USED TO SIT THERE TALKING TO ME VERY SCARY.
THEY WOULD SAY WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?
I SAY 500 YARDS OVER THERE.
THEY WOULD GO REALLY?
I WOULD SAY, YEAH.
FROM THEN ON INSTEAD OF TALKING TO ME LIKE AN OLD MAN FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF SPACE, SOME
MOVIE STAR, THEY TALKED TO ME AS THOUGH I WAS THEM.
I AM THEM, REALLY.
ONE OF THE REASONS I MADE THE MOVIE WAS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT IT IS HOW IT IS.
IN ENGLAND IF YOU DON'T GO TO THESE ESTATES YOU DON'T KNOW THEY ARE THERE.
YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE PEOPLE.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE SHOI.
>> Jon: I'VE GOT TO CUT THE FEEDBACK THERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE LET PEOPLE WATCH.
>> I WAS WATCHING ALL THAT.
I'M GOING TO TELL GORDON BROWN ABOUT YOU.
>> Jon: DON'T.
DON'T.
>> TOMORROW HE'S GOING TO HEAR.
>> Jon: I HAVE A FEELING HE WILL BE UNEMPLOYED SOON ANY WAY.
DEVELOP SOME TIME TO COME OVER HERE.
>> HOPEFULLY.
>> Jon: IN ENGLAND HAS HE BOTTOMED OUT.
HAS SUPPORT FOR LABOR JUST --
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS TELEVISION.
TELEVISION THERE'S A PARTY THE LIBERALS.
THEY WERE A JOKE.
>> Jon: THE LIB-DEMS.
>> THE LIB-LEGALS.
-- LIB-DEMS.
HE WAS TREATED IN PARTMENT LIKE A TEA BOY.
[LAUGHTER]
ONCE THEY GOT ON TELEVISION HE WALKED AWAY WITH THE SHOW.
>> Jon:S IF LIKE THE NIXON KENNEDY DEBATE.
GORDON BROWN WAS LIKE I DON'T NEED MAKEUP.
HE STARTED SWEATING AND THE WHOLE THING.
>> AND KENNEDY WASHED THE FLOOR WITH HIM.
PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THE LIB-DEM POLICIES.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE TEA APPOINT.
BOY.
>> MAYBE WE WON'T VOTE FOR HIM.
ANYWAY.
THE WHOLE POLITICAL SITUATION IN BRITAIN IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING IT'S BEEN IN 100 YEARS FOR ME, AT LEAST AND FOR
BRITISH PEOPLE IT'S FASCINATING.
THE SELECTION NEXT FRIDAY.
>> Jon: -- THE ELECTION IS NEXT FRIDAY.
>> Jon: IT'S SMART.
THEY CONDENSE EVERYTHING FOR SIX WEEKS.
>> YOU DRAG IT ON FOREVER.
>> Jon: THERE'S NO TIME TO GOVERN HERE.
>> IT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: IT'S REALLY STUPID.
THE WAY WE DO IT HAS BECOME SO PERVERSE.
I REALLY LIKE IT.
>> WITH US YOU GO AWAY ON HOLIDAY YOU COME BACK WITH A NEW GOVERNMENT YOU NEVER EVEN KNEW
ABOUT IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: IT'S ALWAYS JUST AN ABSOLUTELY PLEASURE TO SEE YOU MY FRIEND.
COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN SOON.
>> WE GET YOU IN ENGLAND.
I WATCH YOU ALL THE TIME IN ENGLAND.
>> Jon: I WILL WATCH MY LANGUAGE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT A SIR WAS WATCHING.
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL SEURZ WATCHING||||
