SAM BEE AT THE VATICAN, EVERYBODY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, NEWS OF BENEDICT'S DEPARTURE DID COME AS A BIT OF A SURPRISE.
FOR THE MOST PART THE POPE PLAYED HIS RESIGNATION PRETTY CLOSE TO THE VESTMENTS
>> THIS IS A DECISION, THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LOW-KEY POPE
>> Jon: YES, YES.
A LOW-KEY POPE.
AS TO THE PAST WILD MAN POPES LIKE POPE AWESOME III.
CAN A BROTHER GET AN AVA MARIA UP IN THE BASILICA.
PARTY POPE IS IN GOD'S HOUSE.
ACTUALLY, THIS DOES RAISE AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
WHO MIGHT THE NEXT POPE BE?
ONE ANALYST SUGGESTS HISTORY COULD BE OUR GUIDE.
>> THE CHURCH, WHENNITY LECTS POPES, HAS A HISTORY OF GOING LONG POPE SHORT POPE LONG POPE
SHORT POPE.
>> Jon: YOU ARE TALKING LENGTH OF SERVICE, YES?
FOR MORE, JOHN OLIVER IS GOING TO BE THERE.
OUR SENIOR CATHOLIC CORRESPONDENT.
HE IS ALSO IN ROME.
JOHN, THANKS FOR JOINING US ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> HI, JON.
JON, HERE I AM ALSO DEFINITELY IN ROME.
EVEN THOUGH NEWS OF BENEDICT'S RESIGNATION BROKE JUST THIS MORNING I GOT ON A PLANE AND
FLEW HERE TO ROME WHERE I DEFINITELY AM.
>> Jon: THANKS FOR DOING THAT, JOHN.
I HEAR THAT THE VATICAN CULTURE MINISTER IS UP THERE
>> HE'S 71, JON.
HE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF GOING TO CHRIS TO HAVE SHOWNBERG.
>> Jon: THEY'RE GOING TO GO DUE TONIC AGAIN
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
[BLEEP] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
>> Jon: I FOLLOW MIGHTER METRICS, MY FRIEND.
IT'S MATH, OLIVER.
>> YOU DON'T FOLLOW [BLEEP],
[BLEEP]
>> Jon: JUST BEFORE YOU WERE A
[BLEEP].
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I HAD POSTERS ON MY WALL WHEN I WAS A KID.
LEO WAS THE CUTE ONE.
CONSTANTINE WAS THE BAD BOY
>> I MUST HAVE MISSED THAT WHILE I WAS PLAYING SPORTS AND GETTING LAID.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
>> Jon: I PLAYED SPORTS.
YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE Jon: YOU'RE IN ROME.
ANY INSIDE INFORMATION?
>> HONESTLY, I'M HEARING THE NAME MITT ROMNEY FLOATED AROUND A LOT.
>> Jon: ROMNEY?
HE'S A MORMON
>> NO, HE WAS A MORMON.
EASY INVOLVED ON THAT ISSUE.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
WHY DOES THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS LIKE SANTORUM AS WELL AS GINGRICH, BACHMAN AND RICK PERRY.
THE ONLY PROBLEM THERE, OF COURSE, IS THAT PERRY APPARENTLY HAS TROUBLE REMEMBERING THE HOLY TRINITY.
>> FATHER, SON, AND THE...
WHAT'S THE THIRD ONE THERE?
LET'S SEE.
>> YOU CAN'T NAME THE THIRD ONE?
THE THIRD ONE, I CAN'T, SORRY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: THAT'S JUST LAST YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HARDLY IN THE RUNNING FOR POPE
>> I'M SORRY, JON.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WOULD WOULD THEY KNOW ABOUT APPEALING TO A FLOUNDERING ORGANIZATION DOMINATED BY OLD
WHITE MEN CLINGING TO AN ARCANE MORAL CODE WHO MUST RELUCTANTLY EMBRACE CHANGE TO STAY RELEVANT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE'S NO CROSSOVER THERE AT ALL, JON.
NOT AT ALL.
I'M JUST GOING TO GO, JON, UNLESS I'M BEING SARCASTIC IN WHICH CASE I THINK I'LL ACTUALLY
STAY
>> Jon: IF THAT'S THE CASE, JOHN, THE CHURCH NEEDS TO REBRAND AS MUCH AS THE G.O.P.
DOES.
THEY HAVE TO GO LATINO.
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S GOT TO BE POPE RUBIO
>> LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, JON.
ALMOST HALF OF CURRENT CATHOLICS LIVE IN LATIN AMERICA.
THEY'RE BREEDING LIKE RABBITS.
THEY CAN'T HELP IT.
THEY'RE LITERALLY NOT ALLOWED TO HELP IT.
AND WHEN YOU COMBINE A RELIGIOUS BAN ON BIRTH CONTROL, JON, WITH THE FIERY PASSION OF THE LATINO
CULTURE, AYE CARUMBA, JON, IT'S MUY CALIENE
>> Jon: THE POPE WILL BE OKAY WITH THIS?
>> MAYBE NOT, JON.
LETS NOT RULE OUT WHAT VATICAN WATCHERS ARE CALLING THE FULL LENOSON AERO.
BENEDICT STEPS DOWN PROMISING HIS JOB TO A YOUNGER GUY.
AFTER LOOKING AT A LOWLY FUTURE WITH NO CHILDREN AND JUST HIS HUGE COLLECTION OF POPE MOBILES
FOR COMPANY HE COMES BACK A FEW MONTHS LATER DEMANDING HIS OLD JOB.
>> Jon: OR BENEDICT SAYS THE NEW JOB CAN HAVE HIS JOB BUT HE KEEPS ON BLESSING PEOPLE AN HOUR
BEFORE HIS SUCCESSOR
>> EXACTLY, JON.
IF THAT HAPPENS I'M GOING FULL TEAM POPO OVER THIS.
>> Jon: POPO, PO
