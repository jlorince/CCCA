>> HI!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THIS IS -- >> OH MY GOODNESS.
>> Jon: THEY'RE VERY EXCITEDTO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU. VERY, VERY NICECROWD.
I JUST SAW IT REALLY HOT GUYIN A DIAPER BACKSTAGE.
>> Jon: WE DID --T'S BEENONE OF THOSE THE PAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS. WE THOUGHT YOUKNOW WHAT, THROW JASON IN A
DIAPER. IT'S ONE OF THOSETHINGS -- IN CASE OF EMERGENCY,
BREAK GLASS.
AND JASON'S IN THERE IN ADIAPER.
>> HE'S DOING IT IT AND HEIS SO SEXY.
>> Jon: WELL -- AND HE DOES ITTO SAVE OUR SOULS.
CONGRATULATIONS ON THEGOLDEN GLOBE, REALLY.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: IT'S VERY WELL-DESERVED.
THIS IS -- BOY, WAS I WRECKEDWATCHING THIS FILM.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Jon: NOW I DON'T KNOW WHATYOUR EXPERIENCE WAS.
I KNOW AS AN INDEPENDENTFILM YOU HAD TO DO IT
QUICKLY.
I HAVE A HISTORY IN MYFAMILY OF ALZHEIMER, OF
DIMENTIA, OR PEOPLE WHO HAVEDIED.
YOU CAPTURE SOMETHING INTHIS THAT IS REMARKABLE FOR
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE GONETHROUGH THE SIMILAR THING.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE HADTHAT EXPERIENCE.
>> I MEAN, NO, I HADN'T. THAT'SWHAT WAS SO INTERESTING. I'M
LUCKY I HAVEN'T ANY PERSONALEXPERIENCE WITH ALZHEIMER AND
BECAUSE I HADN'T I DIDN'T KNOWANYTHING ABOUT IT ARE OR THE
BEHAVIORS.
I DID SAY TO TE FILMMAKERS IDIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
ON SCREEN THAT I HADN'TPERSONALLY WITNESSED.
SO I ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO ALOT OF RESEARCH.
AND THEY WERE SO GENEROUSWITH THEIR TIME, WITH THEIR
EXPERIENCE.
AND ALL THE WOMEN I SPOKE TOWERE REALLY ARTICULATE AND VERY
PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THE BEHAVIORSWERE AND HOW THEY FELT.
I WOULD ASK THEM, HOW DOESTHIS FEEL?
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THISHAPPENS?
AND WHEN DID IT FIRSTMANIFEST?
AND EVERYBODY WAS REALLYVERY HELPFUL.
SO EVERYTHING I DO IN THEMOVIE, I ACTUALLY, I SAW OR
WAS EXPLAINED TO ME.
>> Jon: THERE IS ONE PARTICULARMOMENT THAT CRUSHED ME.
THERE IS A SENSE WHEN SOMEONE ISGOING THROUGH THAT, THEY GET
TO A PLACE WHERE THEY DON'TREALLY EXIST  ON THE SAME
COGNITIVE PLANE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  BUT THEY COME BACK FORA MOMENT.
AND THEN YOU SEE IN THEIREYES, THEY'RE TERRIFIED.
>> YES, AND ONE OF THETHINGS THAT I HEARD FROM
PEOPLE TOO WHEN I ASKED, YOUKNOW, WHAT IS IT LIKE?
THEY SAY IT'S NOT ALWAYS THESAME.
YOU LITERALLY HAVE GOOD DAYSAND BAD DAYS.
A GOOD DAY, YOU THINK I'MFINE. I'M COPING.
I DON'T HAVE ALZHEIMER. ON ABAD DAY YOU THINK I CAN'T
GET THROUGH ANYTHING.
AND THE SAME THING WILL HAPPENMOMENT TO MOMENT.
SO YOU WILL HAVE THESEFLASHES OF COGNITION THAT
THERE ARE NORMAL, BUT YOUWILL HAVE DROPOUTS.
FOR EXAMPLE, GETTING LOST,WAS EXPLAINED TO ME NOT LIKE
DO I GO LEFT OR RIGHT BUT ASA LOSS, LIKE A PANIC ATTACK.
SUDDENTLY YOU'RE LOOKING ATSOMETHING AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.
AND YOUR HEART STARTS TOPOUND AND YOU ARE SHORT OF
BREATH AND THEY, EVERYONETOLD ME STAY CALM, STAY
WHERE ARE YOU, TAKE A DEEPBREATH AND WAIT.
THEY SAY DON'T GO ANYWHEREIF YOU CAN POSSIBLY AVOID
IT.
>> Jon: BUT THEN MOMENTS OFGREAT JOY.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SORT OF, I CAN REMEMBERMOMENTS OF REAL HAPPINESS
AND ALMOST BECOMING TOUGHERFOR THOSE AROUND YOU.
AS THE PERSON SLIPS AWAR, THEYENTER A PLACE ALMOST OUT OF
PRESERVATION THAT IS A LITTLEMORE JOYFUL, MAYBE IN A
DIFFERENT PLACE, A DIFFERENTTIME THEY EXIST.
BUT YOU DON'T, YOU ARE HAPPYFOR THEIR ESCAPE.
>> THEIR ESCAPE.
IF IT HAPPENS THAT WAY --
>> Jon: IT DOESN'T ALWAYSHAPPEN.
>> IT DEPENDS ON THEINDIVIDUAL.
AND SO LITERALLY, IN STAGESWHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE
DECLINED, YOU KNOW, THEY WILLSOMETIMES REVERSE TO PLACES
WHERE THEY WERE HAPPINESSEST.
THERE WAS A GUY I MET ACTUALLYIN A FACILITY WHO WAS REALLY
GREGARIOUS, WOULD GREETEVERYBODY AS THEY CAME IN AND
SAY "WHAT'S YOUR NAME? SITDOWN, SISTER."
HE TALKED TO ME AWHILE.
AND HE HAD OWNED A BAR ON SECONDAVENUE.
>> Jon: OH, WOW.
SO HE HAD BEEN A BARTENDERHIS ENTIRE LIFE AND THAT
REMAINED WITH HIM.
YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OFSOCIABILITY AND LOVE OF
CONVERSATION.
AND SO I DID FIND THATPEOPLE DID NOT, IT'S NOT
LIKE SOMEONE DISAPPEARSENTIRELY.
THERE IS ALWAYS A SENSE OFWHO THEY ARE.
>> Jon: VERY INTERESTING. AS ITGOES --
AND IT IS DIFFERENT TOO,EARLY ONSET AS OPPOSED
TO-- IN THEIR 70s.
>> YES. 15% OF THE ALZHEIMERPOPULATION HAS EARLY OR
YOUNGER WHY ONSET, YOUNGERTHAN 65.
LISA GENOVA, WHO WROTE THE BOOK,HER GRANDMOTHER HAD
ALZHEIMERMENT AND SHE -- SO OFFTHEN IS A MISNOMER THAT DEMENTIA
IS A NORMAL PART OF AGING, WHENIN FACT IT IS NOT IT IS A
DISEASE.
SHE FELT LIKE THE DISEASEWOULD BE BETTER PRESENTED
PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND THESYMPTOMS IF SHE PLACED IT IN
A YOUNGER INDIVIDUAL.
>> Jon: IS IT TRUE THEDIRECTOR OR THE WRITER HAS
AN ALS DIAGNOSIS.
>> ALS.
>> Jon: ALMOST THE ANTITHESIS.IT'S THIS STRANGE INVERSION
OF ALZHEIMER.
>> EXACTLY.
WASH WESTMORELAND  AND RICHARDGLATZER ARE A COUPLE.
THEY ARE ROMANTIC PARTNERS --THEY'RE MARRIED, AND THEY'RE
ALSO WORKING PARTNERS.
AND RICHARD WAS DIAGNOSED WITHALS.
>> Jon: WILE HE WAS DOINGTHE PROJECT?
>> NO, BEFORE, BEFORE.
WHEN I FIRST MET THEM HE HADDIFFICULTY WITH SPEECH BUT
BY THE TIME WE SHOT A YEARLATER, HE HAD REALLY LOST
HIS PHYSICALITY FROM THEWAIST UP. SO HE ONLY --
HE COULD USE ONE HAND WILE HEWAS DIRECTING THROUGH THE iPAD.
SO THAT WAS THE THING.
IN THE MIDST OF THIS, THESEGUYS WERE MAKING A MOVIE
THAT PARALLELED WITH THEIREXPERIENCE WAS, WHICH WAS
EXTRAORDINARY.
>> Jon: MAYBE THAT'S WHAT ITWAS -- BOY, IT'S GRIPPING.
>> IT FEELS SUPER PERSONAL.
>> Jon: YES, VERY SPECIFIC.
>> YEAH, AND I THINK THAT IN THEFACE, I THINK YOU SORT OF
LEARN HOW MUCH YOU LOVE TOLIVE IN THE FACE OF LOSS.
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THETHINGS THEY WERE
EXPERIENCING.
SO IT WAS REALLY ABOUT NOTDIMINISHMENT, BUT JOY.
>> Jon: YOU DO A GREAT JOBTRANSLATING IT TO SCREEN.
VERY POWERFUL.
"STILL ALICE" OPENS INSELECT CITIES ON FRIDAY.
COME ON. IT'S JULIANNE MOORE.
