[LAUGHTER]
FOR MORE ON THE PRESIDENT'S
PUERTO RICAN TRIP, WE TURN TO
OUR SENIOR LATION CORRESPONDENT
AL MADRIGAL.
AL, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AL, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL DOWN
THERE.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE
PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO PUERTO RICO?
WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?
>> JON, TOTAL HOME RUN.
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE PUERTO
RICAN PEOPLE LIKE BASEBALL.
I MEAN, BOTTOM LINE...
[LAUGHTER]
HE MADE A PROMISE TO VISIT THEM,
AND HE DID IT.
DEAL DONE.
BUT, AND THIS IS A BIG PUERTO
RICAN "BUTT"...
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: AL, ARE YOU SUGGESTING
PUERTO RICANS HAVE LARGER BACK
SIDES, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT...
>> I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR.
I DID NOT SAY THAT.
>> Jon: OKAY.
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NO IDEA THE
CAN OF WORMS HE JUST OPENED.
I MEAN, SURE, HE'S WINNING OVER
PUERTO RICANS, BUT HE'S DOING
NOTHING FOR THE OTHER 147 LATINO
NATIONALITIES.
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
DOING TO HIS EFFIGY IN MEXICO
RIGHT NOW?
>> JUST BECAUSE HE WENT TO
PUERTO RICO, I GUESS BURNING IT?
>> BURNING?
WHAT ARE WE, ARABS?
THEY'RE HITTING IT WITH STICKS
UNTIL THE CANDY FALLS OUT, JON.
[LAUGHTER]
MAN, THAT IS A GOOD TIME.
>> Jon: YEAH, AL, THERE ARE
DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES, BUT
AREN'T THERE ISSUES THAT UNIFY
THE LATINO VOTE?
>> YES, BUT EVEN WHEN WE AGREE
ON AN ISSUE, IT'S FOR DIFFERENT
REASONS.
MEXICANS WANT IMMIGRATION
REFORM SO THEY CAN STAY IN THE
COUNTRY.
PUERTO RICANS WANT IMMIGRATION
REFORM TO KEEP THE MEXICANS OUT.
>> Jon: SO THERE ARE
INTERHERITAGE RIVALRIES?
>> YES.
I MEAN, IN THE PAST YOU COULD
GET AWAY WITH TREATING LATINOS
AS ONE GROUP.
JUST THROW A CAMPAIGN AD UP ON
TELEMUNDO AND YOU'RE IN.
NOW YOU SHOW UP AT A RALLY IN
THE WRONG COLOR GUAY ABARA,
TOTAL [BLEEPED].
>> Jon: THE PUERTO RICAN VOTE
IS IMPORTANT.
>> SURE, I GUESS.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME SHOW YOU A MAP.
ALL RIGHT.
BY GOING TO PUERTO RICO, THE
PRESIDENT HAS SECURED AMERICA'S
PUERTO RICAN VOTE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THERE APPEARS TO BE A
SOMEWHAT LARGER BLOCK OF LATINO
VOTERS THAT ARE FEELING A LITTLE
LEFT OUT.
>> Jon: WOW.
THAT'S AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENTIAL.
HOW DOES HE GO AFTER THOSE
VOTERS?
>> WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO STAND IN FRONT OF THEM
AND USE THE PHRASE "ARROZ CON
GANDULES."
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT GOES INTO OTHER LATINOS'
RICE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: REALLY?
THAT REALLY WORKS?
IT REALLY IS ABOUT WHAT GOES
INTO THE RICE?
>> WE TAKE THAT PRETTY
SERIOUSLY.
YOU WANT MEXICAN SUPPORT, ARROZ
