ANYWAY, LET'S BEGIN THE NIGHT
WITH NEWS FROM THE MILITARY.
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS SHOW
FROM A MILITARY BASE AND YOU'VE
NOTICED THAT YOUR FELLOW
SOLDIERS SEEM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
2% TO 10% HAPPIER TODAY--
(LAUGHTER)
-- THE FIGURES ARE VERY HARD TO
GET.
THERE'S A REASON.
>> THE POLICY THAT BANNED GAYS
FROM SERVING OPENLY IN THE
MILITARY IS NOW HISTORY.
>> FROM NOW ON, GAYS CAN SERVE
OPENLY IN THE MILITARY.
>> AND THE 13,000 WHO WERE
DISCHARGED UNDER "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL" CAN REENLIST.
>> Jon: THAT'S HOW RIDICULOUS
THIS POLICY WAS.
THE APOLOGY FOR THE AFFRONT IS
"ALL RIGHT, SORRY, YOU CAN GO TO
AFGHANISTAN AND FIGHT FOR YOUR
COUNTRY."
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY... I KNOW.
THEY'RE LUCKY IT WAS GAY PEOPLE
THAT THEY DISCHARGED FROM THE
ARMY.
ONLY GAY PEOPLE WOULD REMAIN IN
GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE TO BE ABLE TO
REENLIST.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOR MORE ON THE END OF "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL," WE GO TO JASON
JONES INSIDE CAMP D.W.I.ER IN
HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN.
JASON, WHAT'S THE SITUATION OVER
THERE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> JON, THE NIGHTMARE IS REAL!
THE REPEAL OF "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL" HAS TURNED OUR ONCE-PROUD
ARMED FORCES INTO A CAMOUFLAGED
THONG PAN-SEXUAL BACCHANAL.
THIS ISN'T AN ARMY OF ONE, IT'S
AN ARMY OF FUN!
WHOO!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WOW, THAT'S QUITE A GET
WILL HAVE UP.
WOW.
THANK GOD YOU'RE ON SATELLITE.
THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED A HUGE
STIR IF PEOPLE HAD CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE OF THAT OUTFIT.
BUT WAIT A SECOND, JASON,
SOMETHING IS NOT... WHERE ARE
ALL THE SOLDIERS?
>> THEY... UM... UM... THEY'RE
AT TRADER JOE'S!
(LAUGHTER)
GETTING VODKA AND CLEMENTINES.
WE'RE MAKING TANGERINIS!
WHOO!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: JASON, THERE AREN'T ANY
TRADER JOE NIECE AFGHANISTAN.
>> NO.
I KNOW.
CUT THE MUSIC, THIS IS... I'M
SORRY, I WAS JUST TRYING TO
LIVEN UP THE REPORT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SO SOLDIERS AREN'T,
BECAUSE OF THE REPEAL OF "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL" WANDERING
AROUND IN CUT OFF SHORT-SHORTS.
>> NO, THESE ARE MINE.
(LAUGHTER)
ARMY REGULATIONS STILL REQUIRE
ALL SHORT-SHORTS TO BE ANKLE
LENGTH.
AND THEY'RE TO BE CALLED PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT ALL THE HAND
WRINGING OVER THE CHANGES THAT
REPEALING "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL" WOULD BRING?
THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL
WARNED THE REPEAL WOULD LEAD TO
SEXUAL ASSAULTS IN THE SHOWERS.
>> NO.
TURNS OUT REPEALING "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL" DOESN'T ALL OF A
SUDDEN MAKE SHOWER RAPE LEGAL.
(LAUGHTER)
IN FACT, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND
ALL RAPES-- HOMOSEXUAL AND
HETEROSEXUAL-- STILL ILLEGAL.
>> Jon: HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY
CHANGES AT ALL?
>> NOT REALLY, JON.
IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE THAT WORK
IN CLOSE QUARTERS AND COUNT ON
PROTECTING EACH OTHER LIKE
FAMILY DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW THE
DEAL.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL
THE REPEAL OF DON'T CAN ASK
DON'T TELL AROUND HERE?
"NO D'UH TUESDAY."
AND GUESS WHO THE COMMANDING
OFFICER WAS WHO BROKE THE NEWS
TO THEM?
>> Jon: WHO?
>> CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.
>> I MEAN, JON, IT WAS THE ARMY
WHO INVENTED GAYDAR IN THE '06s.
>> Jon: SO THE BIG STORY ABOUT
REPEALING "DON'T ASK, DON'T
TELL" IS THAT THERE IS NO STORY?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JON.
IT HASN'T MADE ANY DIFFERENCES
IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR
FIGHTING FORCES.
TURNS OUT HONORABLE MILITARY
6-SERVICE IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY
CAN SHARE.
>> Jon:.
>> Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE
AFTER LOVE... â™ª
>> Jon: NO, NOT CHER!
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, JASON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT
