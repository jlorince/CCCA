[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]TODAY, OF COURSE, IN SOUTH
AFRICA IT WAS THE MEMORIALCEREMONY FOR NELSON MANDELA.
IT WAS JOYFUL AT TIMES.
THERE WAS SINGING.
THERE WAS DANCING THERE WASLESTER HOLT APPARENTLY REPORTING
FROM THE 1940'S.
[ LAUGHTER ]NO ONE HAD THE HEART TO TELL HIM
HE WAS ACTUALLY JUST SPEAKINGINTO A JUDGE'S GAVEL.
ROOKIE MISTAKE.
ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN.
THE PASSING OF NELSON MANDELALEFT A MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD
THAT NO ACT IS TOO PETTY FORAMERICA'S NEWS MEDIA TO BLOW
COMPLETELY OUT OF PROPORTION.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOOK HANDSWITH THE CUBAN PRESIDENT RAUL
CASTRO. IS THAT A BIG DEAL?
>> THE HANDSHAKE SEEN AROUND THEWORLD.
>> A HANDSHAKE BETWEEN PRESIDENTOBAMA AND RAUL CASTRO RAISING
EYEBROWS, RAISES QUESTIONS ASWELL.
>> Jon: FROM ONLY YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]BARACK OBAMA AT A MEMORIAL
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF NELSONMANDELA, A MAN WHOSE LEGACY IS
THAT HE FORGAVE AND EMBRACED HISFOES AND TORMENTERS AND THUS
INSPIRED HIS COUNTY TO ANATIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC REBIRTH.
ATTENDING THAT OBAMA HAD THEAUDACITY TO GREET ANOTHER WORLD
LEADER WITH A GESTURE SOMEANINGLESS YOU CAN TRAIN A
BASSET HOUND TO DO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT THE (bleep) IS WRONG WITH
US?
[LAUGHTER]CAN SOMEONE BRING SOME
PERSPECTIVE TO THIS AND BY BRINGI MEAN LOSE?
>> WHY SHOULD YOU SHAKE HANDSWITHHY SHOULD YOU SHAKE HANDS
SOMEBODY WHO IS KEEPINGAMERICANS IN PRISON?
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE POINT?
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN SHOOK HANDSWITH HITLER.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: DO I NEED ONCE AGAIN
FROM THE HILLTOPS -- [TO THESOUND OF MUSIC "THE HILLS ARE
ALIVE"]♪ RAUL CASTRO IS NOT ADOLF
HITLER ♪[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
RAUL CASTRO ISN'T EVEN FIDELCASTRO.
HE'S LIKE CUBA'S JIM BELUSHI.
HE'S GOOD BUT HE AIN'T JOHN.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND BY THE WAY, CUBA IS NOT THE
ONLY COUNTRY WITH A SPOTTYT THERECORD
OF IMPRISONING PEOPLE IN CUBA.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND SPEAKING OF HANDSHAKES
WITH QUESTIONABLE LEADERSSENATOR McCAIN, LET HE WHO IS
WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRSTPURELL WIPE. OH IS
THAT YOU SHAKING HANDS WITHQADDAFI?
TURNS OUT THE FUNNY MACHINEMAKING THE CLICKING SOUND
WAS A CAMERA.
WHAT MORE FITTING TRIBUTE COULDTHERE BE TO NELSON MANDELA, A
MAN SO DEDICATED TO FORGIVENESSHE INVITED HIS OWN CAPTOR TO
HIS INAUGURATION THAN FOR OURCOUNTY TO LOSE OUR (bleep)
OVER A HANDSHAKE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO ATA FUNERAL OH, YEAH, HOW ARE YOU
DOING?
BOOP.?
[LAUGHTER]I KNOW OBAMA IS NOT ALLOWED TO
GO BOOM BECAUSE IT'S A TERRORISTFIST THE POINT IS, THE PRESIDENT
BEHAVED HIMSELF JUST FINE.
>> LOOK AT THIS THE PRIMEMINISTER, THE DANISH PRIME
MINISTER AND PRESIDENT OBAMALEANING IN TO TAKE A SELFIE.
[ LAUGHTER ][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
