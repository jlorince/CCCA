RESISTANCE IN AFGHANISTAN."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM JENNY NORDBERG!
♪♪(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HELLO!
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THIS IS A FASCINATINGSTORY. AND A LOOK,
THE UNDERGROUND GIRLS OF KABUL,LOOKING FOR RESISTANCE.
ON LOOKING AT THE BOOK COVER,THE TITLE, I ASSUMED IT WAS THIS
IDEA OF SORT OF TRAFFICKINGOR YOU KNOW, WOMEN HAVING
TO HIDE FROM THE TALIBAN. IT'S AMUCH SORT OF DIFFERENT,
STRANGER AND AT TIMES EVENSADDER STORY. WHAT IS IT?
>> IT'S THE STORY OF AFGHANGIRLS WHO GROW UP AS BOYS.
THEY ARE MADE INTO BOYS.
THEY'RE DRESSED LIKE BOYS WITH ASHORT HAIRCUT AND A PAIR OF
PANTS, BY THEIR PARENTSESSENTIALLY BECAUSE BOYS ARE
WHAT COUNT IN AFGHANISTAN.AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SONS,
THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR A FAMILY,AND PARENTS THEN
WILL SOMETIMES CHOOSE TOBRING UP THE DAUGHTER AS A SON.
>> Jon: AND THEY BRING UP THEDAUGHTER AS A SON, ONE THE
SUPERSTITION THAT GETS THEM SONSAT SOME POINT?
>> THAT'S ONE REASON.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> EVERY FAMILY WILL HAVE ADIFFERENT REASON.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON INAFGHANISTAN.
MANY TIMES IT'S ALSO TO ADDPRESTIGE TO THE FAMILY.
IT'S A DEEPLY PATRIARCHALSOCIETY.
SO A SON WILL CARRY ON THEFAMILY NAME, THE LEGACY, WILL
INHERIT THE PROPERTY, SO YOUNEED A SON TO SHOW TO THE
OUTSIDE WORLD THAT, YOU KNOW,YOU HAVE STRENGTH WITHIN
THE FAMILY AND THAT THEFAMILY ISN'T WEAK.
IT'S INCUMBENT UPON EVERY WOMANAND EVERY FAMILY IN AFGHANISTAN
TO HAVE SONS, AND THENIT WILL ALSO AFFORD MORE
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, FORINSTANCE, FOR LITTLE GIRLS.
MANY TIMES IN DANGEROUS AREAS,FOR INSTANCE, IT MIGHT BE
HARD FOR THEM TO GET TO SCHOOL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN DISGUISED AS A BOY,YOU WOULD HAVE RIGHT OF PASSAGE
IN A WAY THAT A LITTLE GIRLWOULDN'T HAVE, NORMALLY.
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THEPRACTICAL ELEMENT.
MAYBE YOU NEED A SON TO BRING ANINCOME IN TO THE FAMILY, AND
YOU'LL DISGUISE THE GIRLTO GO OUT AND WORK IN A
STORE, FOR INSTANCE, AND SUPPORTTHE FAMILY BASICALLY.
>> Jon: AND THIS IS NOTJUS A PURELY RURAL OR OUTSIDE.
THIS IS ENDEMIC?
>> IT CUTS ACROSS, SOCIALCLASS, LEVEL OF EDUCATION,
PROVINCES, ETHNICITY,IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING
ON FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME INAFGHANISTAN AND IT'S
ESSENTIALLY A CREATIVE WAY TOBUCK THE SYSTEM IN AN IMPOSSIBLE
SOCIETY...>> Jon RIGHT.
>> WITH STRICT GENDERSEGREGATION.
YOU KNOW, MEN DO CERTAIN THINGS,WOMEN DO OTHER THINGS.
LITTLE GIRLS FROM THE TIMETHEY'RE BORN HAVE ESSENTIALLY
VERY FEW RIGHTS.
SO IT'S A WAY TO PASS OVER TOTHE OTHER SIDE.
>> Jon: AND THIS IS WHERE ITGETS REALLY TRICKY.
YOU KNOW, THIS COMES WITH ANEXPIRATION DATE.
>> IT DOES.
>> Jon: WHEN THE GIRLS REACH ALEVEL OF MATURITY OR PUBERTY,
THEY MUST GIVE UP THIS IDENTITYAND LOSE ALL THOSE RIGHTS.
>> WELL, AS MUCH AS THEY CANPLAY WITH GENDER...
>> Jon: YES.
>> IN LITTLE CHILDREN, AND IT'SKIND OF A DON'T ASK DON'T TELL.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THIS ISGOING ON.
WHEN A GIRL ENTERS PUBERTY, SHEMUST TAKE THE TRAJECTORY OF A
TRADITIONAL AFGHAN WOMAN, WHICHIS TO GET MARRIED, HAVE
CHILDREN, IDEALLYSONS, OF HER OWN.
SO THERE'S NO REAL, YOU KNOW,DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
THEN THERE ARE, OF COURSE, THOSEWHO RESIST VERY STRONGLY BECAUSE
THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ON THEOTHER SIDE, SO TO SPEAK, WITH
ALL THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THATARE USUALLY NOT AFFORDED GIRLS
IN AFGHANISTAN.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS A PART THATI THINK MUST BE INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT.
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THEDIFFICULTIES OF BEING IN A
WAR-TORN REGION, BEINGPOVERTY-STRICKEN, GOING THROUGH
PUBERTY AND LOSING ALL OFTHE FREEDOM THAT YOU
EXPERIENCED AS A BOY ANDWATCHING OTHER LITTLE BOYS GOING
THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS,ENJOYING MORE FREEDOMS, IT MUST
BE DEVASTATING IN TERMS OF THEIREMOTIONAL STATE.
>> IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICALEXPERIMENT.
IT'S A NATURE VERSUS NURTUREEXPERIMENT.
LIKE YOU'RE SAYING, IN ACONSTANT HEIGHTENED, TENSE
ATMOSPHERE OF WAR THAT'S BEENGOING ON FOR DECADES.
SO, WHEN I'VE SPOKEN TO ALL OFTHESE SUBJECTS IN MY BOOK,
FOR INSTANCE, ANDWHAT MY RESEARCH SHOWS
IS THAT MANY TIMES THEY, YOUKNOW, THERE ARE SO
MANY LAYERS OF PSYCHOLOGICALISSUES AND PROBLEMS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, IFYOU'VE GROWN UP AS A BOY AND A
YOUNG MAN, MANY TIMES IT CAN BEPRACTICALLY VERY DIFFICULT, YOU
KNOW, FROM A PRACTICALSTANDPOINT, BECAUSE YOU DON'T
KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THEOTHER SIDE HOW TO GREET WOMEN,
HOW TO TALK TO WOMEN, HOW TOCOOK, HOW TO WALK LIKE A WOMAN.
>> Jon: DO THEY BELIEVE THATTHEY DESERVE TO BE PUT BACK FROM
HAVING THEIR RIGHTS?
IS THERE SOMETHING IN THEIRSOCIETY THAT HAS TAUGHT THEM,
OKAY, AT THIS POINT, YOU GO BACKTHERE AND YOU DESERVE THAT?
AND THAT'S... IS IT A LEVELLING?
>> WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TOUNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A CHOICE
BY THE PARENTS MANY TIMES.
SOME LITTLE GIRLS ARE BORN ANDINTRODUCED TO THE VILLAGE AND
THE NEIGHBORS AS THE FAMILY'SSON.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU THINKOF AS FREE WILL AND THE RIGHT TO
CHOOSE MAY NOT BE APPLICABLEFOR THESE GIRLS.
HOWEVER, WHEN YOU'VE GROWN UPFOR 10, YOU KNOW, 13, 12, 15
YEARS -->> Jon: SURE.
>> ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S, YOUDO SEE THAT SOCIETY IS
SEGREGATED. LIKE ONE OFTHESE 15-YEAR-OLD GIRLS
SAID TO ME, I SEE HOWWOMEN ARE TREATED HERE,
WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE ONE OFTHEM?
I WILL REMAIN A BOY, I WANTTO REMAIN A BOY ALWAYS.
>> Jon: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR ASECOND?
I WANT TO FIND OUT, IN SOCIETIESTHAT UNDERGO THIS TYPE OF TUMULT
AND WAR, GENERALLY RIGHTSADVANCE, BUT AND IT HAS NOT
HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN AND SOMEOF THESE OTHER PATRIARCHAL
SOCIETIES. I WONDERWHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.
WE'LL COME BACK, ON THE WEB.
"THE UNDERGROUND GIRLS OFKABUL," IT'S ON THE SHELVES NOW,
JENNY NORDBERG.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
