AND THAT CONCLUDES THE (bleep) SHERLOCK HEARING.
SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT, POPPED IT UPSTAIRS AND GIVEN THE PEOPLE AT THE CONSULATE MORE SECURITY.
THAT'S A FAIR POINT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ALL IDENTICALLY MAKE.
THIS ABILITY CLINTONS'S FIRST GO ROUND IN THE FINGER POINTING RODEO.
SHE'S MAGNEETO.
IT WOULD BE ONLY APRIL PROIF THEY HAD A METAL COMPONENT AND IF IT DIDN'T EFFECT METAL BUT
FINGERS FIGNEETO.
JUST ROLE THE THING.
>> JUDGMENT ERRORS AND THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE REPLACED, FIRED AND NO LONGER IN A
POSITION OF MAKING JUDGMENT CALLS.
>> THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TO BE CUT LOOSE WHEN THEY ARE NOT PERFORMING THEIR TASKS.
>> Jon: EXPLAIN YOURSELF MADAM SECRETARY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU FIRE ANYONE?
>> UNDER FEDERAL STATUTE AND REGULATION, UNSATISFACTORY LEADERSHIP IS NOT GROUNDS FOR
FINDING A BREACH OF DUTY.
I HAVE SUBMITTED LEGISLATION TO THIS COMMITTEE, TO THE CONGRESS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.
>> Jon: AHHH.
>> WHY DID STATE NOT IMMEDIATELY REVAMP OUR SECURITY PROTOCOLS PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS?
>> Jon: A-H A, MS., I HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS WHY WASN'T THERE MORE SECURITY.
>> I DIDN'T SEE THE QUESTIONS.
I DIDN'T APPROVE THEM.
I DIDN'T DENY THEM.
THEY DIDN'T COME TO AMERICA WE'VE ASKED TO HELP REALLOCATE FUNDS.
THE SPHAT HAS GIVEN US THAT AUTHORITY.
WE DON'T HAVE IT FROM THE HOUSE TO GET MORE MARINE GUARDS AND DIPLOMATIC SECURITY GUARDS.
>> Jon: WHOOOO SON OF A BITCH!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE LIVE IN POLARIZED TIMES SO THE REPUBLICANS COULD NOT CONTAIN THE INSTINCTS COT
DEMOCRATS BRING IT TO A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE PLACE.
>> YOU HAVE REPRESENTED OUR COUNTRY WITH TREMENDOUS STRENGTH AND POISE.
>> THE WAY YOU'VE WORKED, THE TIRELESS EFFORT YOU'VE HAD.
>> REMARKABLE SKILLS AND STAMINA.
>> OPENNESS AND THOUGHTFULNESS TODAY.
>> YOU SAID EARLIER WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH PROMOTING OURSELVES AROUND THE WORLD.
I THINK YOU HAVE.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR A WORKER IN THIS TOWN, LET ME KNOW.
>> Jon: MS. CLINTON WOULD YOU MAKE US THE LUCKIEST COMMITTEE IN THE WORLD?
SORRY, DID I SAY CONSTRUCTIVE I MEANT ASS-LICKY.
YOU HAVE THE SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER OATH AND YOU ARE FISHING FOR RESTAURANT RECOMMENDATIONS
EVEN PAULA ABDUL IS WATCHING THIS GOING JESUS, GO A LITTLE HARDER ON HER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT APPEARED DEMOCRATS SAW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO QUESTION HER BUT TO INTERVIEW
FOR PERHAPS A FUTURE POSITION.
>> I SALUTE YOU AND LOOK AHEAD TO 2016 WIRK YOU SUCCESS AND EXTENDED TO YOU MY HIGHEST REGARDS.
>> Jon: (bleep).
OH, MY GOD -- WAIT A MINUTE THERE'S NO AMERICAN SAMOA DELEGATE ON THE COMMITTEE.
I KNEW IT IT'S NOTED UBER-PRANKSTER RONAIAH TUIASOSOPO!
TUIASOSOPO, I KNEW IT WAS YOU-ASOSOPO FROM THAT CLUE-ASOSOPO.
FOR I AM RUBBER AND YOU ARE GLUE-ASOSOPO.
THERE'S AN AMERICAN SEW MOWAN DELEGATE ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.
I WANTED TO DO FOUR STRAIGHT DAYS OF THAT BIT, YOU KNOW,
