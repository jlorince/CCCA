(LAUGHTER)
BUT WE ARE BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHERE DID WE... LET ME E ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
WHERE DID WE LEAVE OFF?
WHERE DID WE...
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
ASKING THE QUESTION WHEREBY THE
JOBS?
>> WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON JOBS.
>> WHERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
ISSUE WE FACE, EXPANDING THE
ECONOMY AND CREATING JOBS.
>> WHERE ISJOBS.
>> Jon: I AM SO CONCERNED
ABOUT JOBS THAT I LEFT MY JOB TO
RUN FOR OFFICE TO CREATE JOBS
FOR OTHER...
(LAUGHTER).
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT!
NOW, SOMEONE ELSE CAN TAKE MY
OLD JOB, I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME
OTHER GUY'S JOB AND THAT GUY CAN
GO (BLEEP) HIMSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
GOOD NEWS, THOUGH.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THAT
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WAS BACK IN SESSION
HE WOULD GIVE A SPEECH TO BOTH
HOUSES OF CONGRESS ON THE VERY
PRESSING TOPIC OF JOBS.
>> THERE'S A REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AT THE SAME
TIME HE WANTED TO SPEAK.
>> Jon: DAMN!
(LAUGHTER)
A REPUBLICAN DEBATE THE VERY
SAME NIGHT THE PRESIDENT WISHES
TO SPEAK ABOUT JOBS.
I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING TO
GO.
LOGGERHEADS, BATTLES, CONFLICT,
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, ESCALATION
OF RHETORIC, RACE WAR, FERRELL
LEPRECHAUNS ROAMING THE STREETS.
WE'RE DOOMED!
>> WEDNESDAY SEEMED TO BE THE
BEST OPTION, WHEN THAT WASN'T
AVAILABLE... WHEN THAT SEEMED TO
BE A PROBLEM, THURSDAY WAS FINE
WITH US.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WELL, THERE YOU HAVE
IT.
THE PRESIDENT OFFERED A DATE,
THE REPUBLICANS SAID "COULD YOU
MOVE THAT A DAY?"
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID "ALL
RIGHT."
(LAUGHTER)
NONCRISIS AVERTED.
IT'S THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF
WHAT I HOPE WILL BE MANY IN OUR
NEW SEGMENT "TALES OF REASONABLE
ACCOMMODATION."
I TELL YOU, IT'S NICE TO SEE
THAT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.
PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WORK
TOGETHER TO SOLVE A MINOR...
>> THE ONE DAY CONTROVERSY KNOWN
AS SPEECH-GATE.
>> WHERE IS SPEECH-GATE.
>> WHERE IS DEBATE-GATE.
>> WHERE IS HOW CAN OUR
POLITICAL LEADERS DO BIG THINGS
LIKE REDUCE THE DEBT OR FIX THE
ECONOMY IF THEY BUTT HEADS OVER
A SCHEDULING SPEECH.
>> Jon: ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING
INSANE?
(LAUGHTER)
"HOW CAN AMERICANS TRUST THEIR
POLITICAL LEADERS NOT TO SNEAK
INTO THEIR HOUSES AND KILL THEM
IN THEIR SLEEP WHEN IT TOOK THEM
24 WHOLE HOURS TO DO A SCHEDULE
RETHINGY."
SEE, THIS IS WHY I HATE THE
24-HOUR NEWS NETWORKS.
WELL, AMONG THE REASONS I HATE
THEM.
THEY'VE TURNED OUR TALE OF
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION INTO
TALE OF MANUFACTURED
CONTROVERSY.
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A
BIG DEAL ABOUT THE CONFLICT, YOU
HAVE TO MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT
THE RESOLUTION.
>> WHERE IS DID HE LOSE THIS
ROUND?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS CAVED.
>> HE ALSO APPEARS PARTISAN
BECAUSE DID HE SCHEDULE THE BIG
SPEECH ON PURPOSE TO TAKE PLACE
ON THE VERY SAME DAY A
REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS BROADCAST?
>> IT SYMBOLICALLY BECAME A SIGN
OF WEAKNESS.
>> WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT HAS
CAVED.
>> Jon: THE PRESIDENT PUT ON
HIS FOOTY PAJAMAS.
(LAUGHTER)
DIPPED HIS PACIFIER IN BRANDY
AND CURLED UP SMALLER AND
SMALLER UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF
NESTLED INSIDE HIS OWN BALLS.
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE A SET OF RUSSIAN TESTICLE
DOLLS.
BUT, ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU CAN EXPECT THE CABLE NEWS
BLOW HARDS TO FOCUS ON THE
SIDESHOW.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE WHITE
HOUSE PRESS CORPS, TO GET TO THE
REAL SUBSTANCE.
>> WHERE IS HOW HAS THE
PRESIDENT REACTED TO THE WHOLE
DEBATE YESTERDAY OVER THE ISSUES
OVER THE SCHEDULING OF THE
SPEECH?
>> THERE'S A PERCEPTION EVEN
AMONG DEMOCRATS THAT HE DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH CLOUT WITH THE HILL
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DAY IT IS.
HOW IS HE GOING TO PASS A PLAN
TO HELP THE AMERICAN THEM?
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THE WHITE
HOUSE WOULD HAVE DONE
DIFFERENTLY.
>> HOW CAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
EXPECT HE CAN DO SOMETHING MUCH
MORE DIFFICULT?
>> DID THE PRESIDENT GIVE IN OR
CAPITULATE.
>> WHERE IS DOES THIS HAVE TO BE
FIXED.
>> WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT CAN'T
GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS
CONGRESS.
>> WHERE IS THIS COMMUNICATED...
>> IS THIS THE PLAN ALL ALONG.
>> WHERE IS HE SAID, ALL RIGHT,
FINE, WE'LL DO IT ON THURSDAY.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: THERE WERE 23
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHEDULING
OF THE SPEECH.
NINE ABOUT ITS CONTENT.
SO I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT AT
APPROXIMATELY 11:00 P.M. EASTERN
STANDARD TIME WE'RE READY TO
CALL IT THE INCUMBENT STYLE
THUMPS SUBSTANCE 72% TO 28%.
WALTER MONDALE LAUGHED AT HOW
POORLY SUBSTANCE DID.
I'M SURE
