[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE TONIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE TONIGHT?
RALPH FIENNES IS GOING TO BE
HERE TONIGHT, RALPH FIENNES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WE'RE GOING TO TALK CRAFT,
ACTING CRAFT, HE AND I.
WELL, HE IS.
I'M JUST GOING TO REMIND HIM I
WAS IN "HALF-BAKED."
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S START IN WASHINGTON WHERE
LAST WEEK THE SENATE PASSED THE
2011 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
BILL, WHICH AUTHORIZED ALL THE
MONEY FOR OUR ARMED FORCES BY A
WHOPPING 93-7.
OF COURSE, THE DEFENSE
PROBATIONS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE
MUST-PASS PIECES OF LEGISLATION.
EVERY YEAR YOU ALWAYS SEE SOME
CRAZY PROVISION SOMEONE SNEAKS
IN THERE, LIKE IN 2007 IT WAS
INTELLIGENT CLOTHING.
WE WERE GOING TO PAY TO DEVELOP
CLOTHING THAT DETECTS CHEMICAL
ATTACKS.
IN 2009 IT WAS HAWAIIAN HEALTH
CARE NETWORK, AND, OF COURSE,
LAST YEAR THE FLYING BULLDOZER.
IT'S UNNECESSARY.
[LAUGHTER]
SEE WHAT WACKY PROVISIONS GOT
FOLDED INTO THIS YEAR'S BILL.
>> THE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE
INDEFINITE MILITARY DETENTION OF
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO ARE
SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN
TERRORISM, EVEN THOSE CAPTURED
HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY, IN THE
UNITED STATES, WHICH I THINK
SHOULD CONCERN EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF US.
>> Jon: YES.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT IS SOMEWHAT CONCERNING, A
BILL THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT
TO LOCK UP AN AMERICAN CITIZEN
INDEFINITELY, WITHOUT A TRIAL,
THUS APPARENTLY NULLIFYING THE
FOURTH AMENDMENT OF THE
CONSTITUTION.
I CAN SEE WHY SEVEN SENATORS
VOTED AGAINST IT.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE
LIKE NINE OR A BAKER'S DOZEN,
BUT ALL RIGHT.
CAN ONLY IMAGINE, THOUGH, THE
SENATE DEBATE ON THE BILL WAS
PRETTY PITCHED.
>> WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HALF
HOUR ON EACH SIDE.
I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH SENATOR
GRAHAM NEEDS.
>> TEN MINUTES.
IS THAT TOO MUCH, FIVE MINUTES?
>> CAN YOU DO FIVE MINUTES?
>> SEVEN.
>> I THINK WE HAVE SEVEN
SPEAKERS ON THIS SIDE.
>> I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK.
>> TRY TO DO EIGHT MINUTES.
>> I'LL TRY TO DO IT AS QUICK AS
I CAN.
>> JON: I CAN ELIMINATE THAT
FREEDOM IN SIX MINUTES.
I CAN ELIMINATE THAT FREEDOM IN
FIVE.
ELIMINATE THAT FREEDOM.
EACH SIDE IN THIS DEBATE HAD
HALF AN HOUR.
FOR THE DEBATE ON ELIMINATING
ONE OF THE MOST BASIC
PROTECTIONS OF CITIZENSHIP, WE
REQUIRE AT LEAST, AT LEAST A
RUNNING TIME OF "TWO BROKE
GIRLS."
[LAUGHTER]
INCLUDING COMMERCIALS.
THIS IS NOT A BANANA REPUBLIC.
WOULD IT BE ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE
THE CASE AGAINST THE BILL?
RAND PAUL OF KENTUCKY, GO.
>> DETAINING CITIZENS WITHOUT A
COURT TRIAL IS NOT AMERICAN.
>> Jon: OH, I DIDN'T EVEN CLICK
THE START BUTTON YET.
WOW, THAT'S A PRETTY PERSUASIVE
CASE AGAINST.
WHAT'S THE CASE FOR?
>> IF THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY
WANTS TO HAVE A SITUATION
PREVAIL WHERE PEOPLE ARE
RELEASED AND GO BACK IN THE
FIGHT AND KILL AMERICANS, HE'S
ENTITLED TO THAT OPINION.
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE
WANTS.
THAT IS THE JEWISH
GRANDMOTHERY-IST ARGUMENT I HAVE
EVER HEARD FOR INDEFINITE
DETENTION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.
[IN JEWISH ACCENT]: IF THE
SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY WANTS THAT
BAD PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
KILL US, I THINK THEY SHOULDN'T
BUT WHAT DO I KNOW?
I'M JUST AN OLD MAN WITH ANGER
MANAGEMENT ISSUES.
I DON'T KNOW.
SPEAKING OF JEWISH GRANDMOTHERS,
WHAT DOES SENATOR CARL LEVIN
THINK OF THIS BILL?
>> AL QAEDA IS AT WAR WITH US.
THEY BROUGHT THAT WAR TO OUR
SHORES.
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK WE WANT TO
KEEP AMERICANS IN PRISON
FOREVER?
OF COURSE WE DON'T.
THIS HURTS US MORE THAN THEM.
LET'S HEAR A LESS JEWISH
ARGUMENT.
>> WE'RE FACING AN ENEMY, NOT A
COMMON CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION,
WHO WILL DO ANYTHING AND
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DESTROY
OUR WAY OF LIFE.
>> Jon: SO WE'RE GOING TO
DESTROY IT BEFORE THEY CAN GET
THEIR HANDS ON IT.
YOU CAN TAKE AWAY OUR LIVES, BUT
ONLY WAY WE CAN TAKE AWAY OUR
FREEDOM MMMMMM.
[IN EXAGGERATED SOUTHERN ACCENT]
LOOK, WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING UP
WITH THIS CYNICAL FEAR MONGERING
FOR TEN YEARS NOW.
IF YOU WANT US TO PUNT OUR RIGHT
TO DEW DUE PROCESS, WE NEED MORE
PURE CONDI SENSE.
>> WHEN YOU JOIN AL QAEDA,
YOU'RE JOINING PEOPLE WHO ARE
BENT ON OUR DESTRUCTION AND WHO
ARE A MILITARY THREAT.
>> Jon: BULL [BLEEPED].
AL QAEDA WISHES IT KILLED AS
MANY AMERICANS AS OUR GANGS DO.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY WISH THEY WERE THAT GOOD AT
KILLING AMERICANS.
SINCE 9/11, OUR GANGS HAVE
KILLED LIKE 10,000 AMERICANS.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM
IS TRYING TO GET THE HEAT OFF OF
GANGS.
ZOOM IN ON HIS FACE.
SON OF A BITCH!
I KNEW IT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
GRAHAM!
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS A CLOSETED
GANGBANGER.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING
