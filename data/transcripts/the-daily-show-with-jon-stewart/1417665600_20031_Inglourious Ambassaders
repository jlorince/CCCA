WELL NOW I'M AT LEASTREADY FOR SOME GOOD NEWS,
SOME POSITIVE NEWS.
MAYBE SOMETHING FROM THE UNITEDSTATES SENATE.
>> THE SENATE CONFIRMED NEWAMBASSADORS TO ARGENTINA AND
HUNGARY TODAY.
>> Jon: THERE YOU GO.
NORMALLY AFTER THE PHRASE "THESENATE HAS CONFIRMED" YOU GET
THIS.
>> NOTHING, YOU LOSE.
GOOD DAY, SIR.
>> Jon: BUT THEY DID IT.
THEY DID SOMETHING.
AND ARGENTINA AND HUNGARY, MAN,THAT AIN'T NOTHING.
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT COUNTRIES.
ARGENTINA IS ONE OF THE WESTERNHEMISPHERE'S LARGEST ECONOMIES,
GOING THROUGH A DEBT CRISIS.HUNGARY IS BEING GOVERNED BY
LIKE A PUTIN DEMAGOGUE TYPEFELLA. THESE ARE CRITICAL POSTS!
AND I'M GLAD THAT OUR SENTATEWAS ABLE TO PUT ASIDE ITS
CULTURE OF PARTISAN DIVISIVENESS
AND DO SOMETHINGNOBLE AND GOOD FOR THIS COUNTRY.
LET'S MEET OUR NEW AMERICANEMISSARIES TO THE WORLD.
>> NOAH MAMET IS NOW THEAMBASSADOR TO ARGENTINA.
>> HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FORNEVER STEPPING FOOT INARGENTINA.
>> HE DOESN'T  SPEAK SPANISH.
>> Jon: QUE? DONDA ESTAHIS QUALIFICATIONS.
ALTHOUGH, I CAN SEEGETTING SOMEONE TO REPRESENT US
IN ARGENTINA WHO ISFLUENT IN SPANISH WOULD BE
VERY DIFFICULT. I MEAN,BARELY TWO-THIRDS OF OUR
POPULATION SPEAKS IT. WELL,MAYBE THE
AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY WILLREDEEM OUR SELECTION PROCESS.
>> HUNGARIAN AMBASSADORCOLLEEN BELL USED TO BE A SOAP
OPERA PRODUCER. SHE ADMITTED INHER HEARING, SHE COULD NOT NAME
THE U.S. INTERESTS IN THATREGION.
>> Jon: OKAY, OKAY, MAYBE SHECAN'T NAME THE INTERESTS
IN THAT REGION. SHE'S A SOAPOPERA PRODUCER.
SHE CAN HELP US WHEN HUNGARY'SPRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN'S
WIFE WAKES UP FROM ASEVEN-YEAR COMA  JUST IN TIME TO
TO CALL OFF HER DAUGHTER'SWEDDING TO A MAN WITH
AMNESIA WHO TURNS OUT TO BE AWOMAN WHO'S PREGNANT
WITH THE ILLEGITIMATE SON OFTHE PRIME MINISTER'S EVIL TWIN,
FERNANDO.
ALL THIS ON TOMORROW'S ALL MYHUNGARIANS.
HOLD ON A SECOND, I SEEM TOREMEMBER THAT EARLIER IN THE
YEAR WE COVERED THESE PEOPLES'CONFIRMATION HEARINGS
AND THEY SEEMED TERRIBLE TOO.BUT THERE WAS SOME SPECIAL
QUALIFICATION THATTHEY DID HAVE.
WHAT WAS THAT?
>> BELL DID RAISE 1.4 BILLIONDOLLARS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
>> MAMET GENERATED MORE THAN$500,000 FOR THE PRESIDENT'S
RE-ELECTION.
>> Jon: WELL, THEN THEY AREFOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF
OUR NATION'S FIRST DIPLOMAT.BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.
NO, NOT THAT ONE. THERE YOU GO.
OF COURSE ULTIMATELY THE SENATEWAS MERELY CONFIRMING
AMBASSADORS HANDPICKED BY THE PRESIDENT.
THE WHITE HOUSE'SRESPONSIBILITY.
MEANING YESTERDAY IT WAS TIMEFOR THE PERSON HOLDING
WASHINGTON'S WORST JOB TO HAVEA LOUSIER DAY THAN USUAL.
>> AMBASSADOR BELL HAS THEPRESIDENT'S CONFIDENCE THAT SHE
WILL DO AN EXCELLENT JOB.
>> WHERE DOES THE PRESIDENT GETTHAT CONFIDENCE?
>> SHE CERTAINLY IS SOMEBODYTHAT, AGAIN, HAS HER OWN
DISTINGUISHED PRIVATESECTOR CAREER.
>> AS A SOAP OPERA PRODUCER,RIGHT.
>> WELL, AND SOMEONE WHO HASOBVIOUSLY SUCCEEDED IN,
YOU KNOW, IN THE BUSINESS WORLD.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: HOW MUCH DOES THAT GUY
WANT TO JUST REACH OVER AND TAGOUT?
JUST GIVE A QUICK ONE TO JAYCARNEY OR MAYBE ROMAN REIGNS OR
MAYBE ONE OF THE USOS OR MAYBEBRAY WYATT OR PERHAPS
BRUNO SAMMARTINO COULD --
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING WRESTLINGFOR A VERY LONG TIME.
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, EARNEST.
>> CAN YOU TELL ME THAT THEFACT THAT SHE HELPED RAISE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDSOF DOLLARS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAD NOTHINGTO DO WITH HER APPOINTMENT.
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT CAN YOU?
>> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THATTHAT'S NOT THE REASON THAT SHE
WAS CHOSEN. I CAN TELL YOU THATTHE REASON SHE WAS CHOSEN --
I, FRANKLY, I WAS NOT A PART OFTHIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS.
>> Jon: WHAT?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT IS THE GREATEST THING IHAVE EVER SEEN THE PRESIDENT'S
PRESS SECRETARY DO.
HIS ENTIRE JOB, HIS ONLY JOB ISBUILT AROUND TRYING NOT TO GO
HEY LOOK, I JUST [BEEP] WORKHERE.
BUT THAT'S WHAT HE DID.
TAKE IT UP WITH MY SUPERVISOR.
EARNEST OUT.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
