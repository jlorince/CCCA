IF YOU HAD GAS I WOULD TROUBLEYOU WITH MY DIFFICULTIES.

IT'S ASTONISHING TO ME. YOUWERE IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF PAIN IN YOUR BACK, YOU WEREGOING THROUGH
CHEMO AT THAT MOMENT -->> IN THAT MOMENT.
>> Jon: AND WORKINGON THAT SPECIAL.
>> THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THEASSASSINATION OF JOHN KENNEDY
AND WE NEEDED IT PROMOTED. AND IWAS AT HOME AND MEREDITH SAID,
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS A GOODIDEA.
I REMINDED HER THAT EGO WAS AVERY STRONG DRUG,
AND I WAS GOING TO BE HERE WITHYOU AND I NEEDED TO DO IT.
BUT ALSO IT'S WHAT I DO, SO IWANTED TO COME HERE AND DO IT.
>> Jon:  HOW LONG -- YOU ARE INREMISSION
OFFICIALLY?
>> I AM. YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS!
THIS IS, SO THE TREATMENT OF IT,HOW INTENSIVE WAS THIS?
YOU WRITE IN THE BOOK YOUACTUALLY MADE OUT A BUCKET LIST.
YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF -->> RIGHT. YEAH.
>> Jon: I SHOULD --ALTHOUGH, IN YOUR LIFE,
LIKE WHAT HAVEN'T YOUDONE?
>> WELL, THERE ARE VERY FEWTHINGS I HAVEN'T DONE BUT ONE
OF THINGS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THETHINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS DO
MORE WRITING.
I WOULD LIKE TO GET A SHORTSTORY PUBLISHED.
I'M A BIG STUDENT OF SHORTSTORIES.
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO LEARNTO PLAY CHESS,
BUT I ALWAYS PUT THAT ON THERE.
I'M GONNA SAY I'M GONNA TAKETIME TO LEARN TO PLAY CHESS.
>> Jon: THIS PROCESS WAS APAINFUL ONE.
HOW DOES IT FEEL NOW?
DOES IT STILL LIMIT THE THINGSYOU DO?
ARE YOU ABLE TO BASICALLY --YOU'RE STILL, YOU'RE A STOIC
INDIVIDUAL. YOU ALWAYS HAVEBEEN.
>> DO EVERYTHING? YEAH, NO WHAT,I'M KIND OF TRYING
TO RECONSTRUCT MY PHYSICALCONDITION AGAIN.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I THINK YOU KNOW THAT I WASIN VERY GOOD PHYSICAL SHAPE.
THAT YEAR I BICYCLED ACROSSCHILE AND ARGENTINA.
I HAD BEEN IN AFRICA AND FISHINGALL OVER MONTANA.
BUT I DID HAVE THIS VERYPERSISTENT AND QUITE PAINFUL
BACK PAIN AND THE ORTHOPEDISTSLOOKED AT IT AND ALL THOUGHT
WELL, IT'S THE KIND OFLIFESTYLE THAT YOU HAVE.
AND THEN A VERY SMART INTERNWITH MY DOCTOR AT THE MAYO
CLINIC SAID SOMETHING ISGOING ON, AND NAILED IT IN ABOUT
THREE HOURS, AND IT WAS, I WASBLINDSIDED BY IT.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> AND WHEN THEY FINISHEDLOOKING AT ALL THE NUMBERS, THE
HEMATOLOGIST TURNED TO ME ANDTHIS WAS HIS PRAISE, HE SAID,
YOU HAVE A MALIGNANCY, IT'SCALLED MULTIPLE MYELOMA.
YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIEDFROM THIS, FRANK REYNOLDS,
THE ABC ANCHOR MAN.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> GERALDINE FERRARO WHO WASTHE FIRST WOMAN TO RUN FOR
VICE PRESIDENT.
AND I OFTEN WONDERED, WHEN YOUGET THAT KIND OF NEWS,
HOW DO YOU REACT?
SO THE JOURNALISTIC PART OF MEKIND OF STEPPED OUTSIDE AND
LOOKED AT ME AND TRIED TO TAKE AMEASURE OF HOW I WAS DOING.
I WAS SURPRISINGLY CALM AND ITHOUGHT IMMEDIATELY ABOUT MY
FAMILY. THAT WAS THE FIRST THINGTHAT CAME TO MY MIND,
THEY'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
WE JUST HAD A REVIEW OF WHERE WEARE, I'VE HAD GREAT GOOD FORTUNE
FINANCIALLY AND WEHAVE GRANDCHILDREN.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
AND THEN I SAID TO HIM HOW MUCHTIME?
HE SAID, STATISTICALLY FIVEYEARS BUT I THINK WE CAN GET
BEYOND THAT.
SO I BEGAN REGISTERING, I WAS 73AT THE TIME,
WELL, I WANT TO DO BETTER THANFIVE YEARS.
I'VE GOT A NEW GRANSON AND IWANT TO BE AROUND FOR A WHILE.
SO I WAS VERY JOURNALISTIC INTERMS OF TRYING TO QUANTIFY
WHERE I WAS IN ALL OF THIS ANDTHAT CONTINUED FOR THE NEXT
24 HOURS OR SO.
>> Jon: AND THEN THE COLLAPSE.
>> NO, I DIDN'T COLLAPSE. I DID--
>> Jon: REALLY?>> I DID SOMETHING --
>> Jon: NOTHING?
BUCKET OF TEARS? NOTHING?
>> NO.
I WENT HOME AND YOU KNOW, MRS.BROKAW --
>> Jon: SHE'S THE BEST.
>> YEAH. AND I SAT WITH HER ANDTOLD HER FOR THE FIRST TIME.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> SHE WAS VERY STRONG.
WE WERE BOTH IN UNCHARTEDTERRITORY FOR US.
I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING ANDDID SOMETHING ACTIVELY STUPID.
I HAD A LONG-PLANNED FISHINGTRIP.
I SAID, HMM, I HAVE CANCER, I'MGOING TO GO FISHING.
AND I GOT OVER TO THECENTRAL PART OF MONTANA AND
I WAS IN A FETAL POSITION WITHPAIN ON A FRIEND'S PORCH AND
GOT BACK AND THAT WAS THEREALIZATION THIS IS GOING TO BE
A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. SEE, THAT PART OFTHE STORY I KNOW,
THE FETAL POSITION ONA FRIEND'S PORCH.
>> WELL, IT'S HOW YOU SPEND YOURWEEKENDS.
>> Jon: CAN I COME UP AND CURLUP IN A BALL ON YOUR PORCH?
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: I WON'T CAUSE ANYTROUBLE!
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THEWORLD OF YOU.
I'M SO THRILLED YOU APPROACHTHIS IN THE WAY YOU APPROACH
EVERYTHING, WITH A GREATANALYSIS AND STOICISM AND
COMPASSION AND EMPATHY AND I'MDELIGHTED YOU'RE IN REMISSION.
AND WE WILL, YOU KNOW, I'MRETIRED, TOO NOW.
PRETTY SOON MAYBE I'LL COME UPAND DO FISHING IN MONTANA TOO.
>> AND I'LL CURL UP ON THEPORCH SOMEWHERE. YEP.
>> Jon: AND CURL UP -- YOU KNOWWHAT?
YOU GO FISHING, AND I'LL CURLUP ON THE PORCH.
AND THAT WILL BE FINE.
>> YOU NOW, I'VE BEEN THINKINGABOUT YOU.
I THINK THE BEST ANALYSIS OFWHERE YOU'RE, YOU'RE IN THE
SECOND SEMESTER OF YOUR SENIORYEAR.
SO YOU KNOW, YOU CAN DO ALL THEKEG PARTIES YOU WANT TO GO TO.
NOBODY'S GOING TO SAYANYTHING, IT'S GOING TO BE A
GREAT TIME.

PART OF THE AMERICANDIALOGUE AND WE'RE

DOESN'T, HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY --SO THEY TELL YOU YOU'VE GOT
MYELOMA IN YOUR BACK, YOU DON'TCRY.
