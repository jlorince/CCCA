♪ >> NOW THAT THE PAGEANTRY OF THE
SOCHI OLYMPICS IS BEHIND US IFINALLY HAVE TIME TO REFLECT ON
MY STAY IN RUSSIA.
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS THATRUSSIANS ARE A LOT LIKE US.
THEY GO TO BARS LIKE US.
THEY ENJOY MUSEUMS LIKE US.
AND THEY EVEN WATCH THE SAMEPIRATED DVDS LIKE US.
>> "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH TINYJEW.
>> JEB AND JOHNSON.
>> YES, GOOD QUALITY.
>> THE ONE GLARING THING THATSEEMED TO SET US APART IS THATRUSSIANS ARE
BONKERS.
THEY DO CRAZY (bleep).
DON'T GET ME WRONG
I LOVEWATCHING IT.
BUT HOW DID THE CULTURE THATGAVE US SWAN LAKE AND WAR ANDPEACE EVOLVE INTO THE WORLD'SPREMIERE TESTING GROUND FOR
JACKASS. I SAT DOWN TO BETTERUNDERSTAND WHY RUSSIANS ARE SOEXTREME.
>> WE LIKE TO PUSH THE LIMITS,WE LIKE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE
FORBIDDEN.
I THINK THAT'S THE DISTINCTFEATURE OF OUR NATION'SMENTALITY.
>> THE CRAZIEST THING YOU'VEDONE?
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER DONEANYTHING CRAZY.
I MOSTLY DO ROOFING.
>> WHAT IS THAT?
>> ROOFING, IT MEANS I WALK ONTHE ROOFS OF BUILDINGS.
>> BEING RUSSIAN SHE VIDEO TAPEDHERSELF AND PUT IT AN  YOUTUBE
FOR MILLIONS TO WITNESS HER(bleep) SANITY.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD VIEWTHAT AS CRAZY.

PUSSY. THAT'S A SAYING INRUSSIA? DON'T BE A PUSSY?
>> YES.
>> YOU CAN'T BE A PUSSY AND LIVEIN RUSSIA.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TO A SIMPLEPOLITICAL BLOGGER WHO
INVESTIGATES GOVERNMENTCORRUPTION.
MEET ALEXI NOVALNI. HE WAS FOURHOURS LATE TO OUR INTERVIEWBECAUSE HE WAS
BEING INTERROGATED BY THE FSB,RUSSIA'S FEDERAL SECURITYSERVICE. A WEEKLY OCCURENCE.
>> I AM FORBIDDEN FROM GOING ONRUSSIAN TELEVISION, I AMLITERALLY BARRED FROM RUNNINGFOR POLITICAL OFFICE.
AND I'VE BEEN ARRESTED MANYTIMES FOR ORGANIZINGANTI-GOVERNMENT
RALLIES.
>> WHY DO YOU DO IT?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT PUTIN AND ALLHIS --
>> AND THEN OUR MICS CUT OUT.
SERIOUSLY THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
>> THE BUGS IN THE OFFICE MAKESSOME PROBLEM FOR THIS EQUIPMENT.
TWICE WE FOUND BUGS IN EVENSMALL VIDEO CAMERA IN THE
OFFICE.
THE FUNNY SITUATION THEY TOOKTHIS BOX AND SEND IT TO THE FSB
FOR THE EXPERTISE SO THE BOXRETURNS TO THE GUYS WHO PLACE
IT.
>> HOLY (bleep).

BUGS INHERE, TOO?

MY NAME IS JEBIN JOHNSON AND I'MHERE TALKING TO SNATCH FIGHT.

>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WENTDOWN.
>> IF YOU GO TO RUSSIA ANDSEE PEOPLE JUMPING OFF BRIDGES
AND HANGING OFF CRANES OR(bleep) DID SHE JUMP OFF A
MOUNTAIN?
OR IF YOU SEE PEOPLE PROTESTING,PUNK ROCKING OR FIGHTING FOR
CHANGE, IT COMES BACK DOWN TOTHAT SIMPLE RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHY.

PUSSY.
>> AND RUSSIANS AIN'T NOPUSSIES.
