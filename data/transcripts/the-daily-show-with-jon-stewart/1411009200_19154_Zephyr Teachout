BOX TO CITIZENS UNITED."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM ZEPHYR TEACHOUT.
HELLO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOININGUS.
I WANT TO TALK -- SO THE BOOKHERE, CORRUPTION, HERE'S THE
SURPRISE, IN AMERICA.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
YOU, THIS IS A REAL CORE ISSUEFOR YOU.
>> YEAH.>> Jon: YOU HAVE STUDIED THIS,
YOU GET INVOLVED IN THEGUBERNATORIAL RACE IN NEW
YORK AS AN UTTER UNKNOWN.
AND THROUGH THE FORCE OFTHIS ISSUE, THROUGH THE
FORCE OF PUTTING IT IN FRONTOF THE VOTERS YOU NEARLY
OVERTURN WHAT WAS AGUBERNATORIAL DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY THAT WAS REALLY MORELIKE A CORONATION BEFORE YOU
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.
>> YEAH, WE ACTUALLY WON OVERHALF THE COUNTIES IN NEW YORK
STATE.
AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT'SREALLY BASIC.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WANTPOLITICIANS WHO FIGHT FOR
THEM.
AND THEY DON'T WANTPOLITICIANS WHO ARE FIGHTING
FOR BIG MONEY.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE COREISSUE HERE.
>> Jon: AND SO THEDIFFICULTY THEN BECOMES HOW
DO YOU SEPARATE THE TWO?
AND HAS MONEY BECOME SOENTRENCHED THAT IT'S NOW
THE AIR THAT THEY BREATHEAND THE FOOD THAT THEY EAT.
>> WELL, IT IS TOO CLOSE TOBEING THAT ENTRENCHED.
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
I MEAN, EVEN OUR CAMPAIGNSHOWS THAT WE ARE NOT THERE
YET.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GOODPEOPLE IN POLITICS WHO ARE,
YOU KNOW, FIGHTING THE GOODFIGHT.
BUT IT'S SO TEMPTING TO GETCAUGHT UP IN THAT NET.
IF YOU ARE SPENDING HALFYOUR TIME FUND-RAISING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I MEAN THAT'S WHO YOUARE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. DID YOU HAVE TO,TO LAUNCH HERE AS A POPULIST
CAMPAIGN, HOW MUCH OF IT DIDEVEN YOU HAVE TO
INVOLVE YOURSELF IN?
>> WELL, AT THE BEGINNING, IMEAN, WE WERE JUST DIGGING
AROUND THE DIRT FOR PENNIES.
LIKE I WAS SPENDING ALL DAYCALLING PEOPLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SAYING, YOU KNOW, LOOK,WE HAVE A CHANCE HERE.
THERE'S AN ANGLE.
AND IT'S HARD AND IT'S HARDBECAUSE IT'S SORT OF, IT'S NOT
WHO WE WANT TO BE AS PEOPLE.
>> SURE.>> TO CALL.
>> Jon: BUT IF, SO LET'S SAY INTHAT SITUATION, A BILLIONAIRE
FINANCER OR A BIG UNIONCOMES BY AND THEY SAY TO YOU
I HAVE A LARGE BAG...>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: IT HAS A DOLLAR SIGNPAINTED ON IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I COULD DROP IT OFF TOYOU.
IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
>> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SAYTHAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO
RESIST THAT.
AND WE EVEN HAD A FEWMOMENTS LIKE THAT.
I MEAN TO BE HONEST, I WOULDTALK TO PEOPLE I CARE A LOT
ABOUT, PUBLIC ED.
I CARE A LOT ABOUT-- YOU KNOW, ISUPPORT TEACHERS UNIONS.
AND WE HAD PEOPLE REALLYSUPPORTIVE OF MY CAMPAIGN
WHO HAD MORE MONEY.
BUT WEREN'T AS EXCITED ABOUTTEACHERS' UNIONS.
AND SO WE WOULD HAVE THESECONVERSATIONS.
IT'S REALLY INTERESTINGBECAUSE IT IS NEVER THIS
EXPLICIT DEAL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OR MAYBE IT IS SOMETIMES.
>> Jon: BUT ISN'T THAT HOWIT TO YOU BEING DENIED.
>> YES. YEAH. WELL..
>> Jon: THE SUPREME COURT ISDEFINING IT AS TRUE
QUID PRO -- CORRUPTION IS ONLYQUID PRO QUO.
>> RIGHT.
>> I GIVE YOU THIS MONEY IF YOUPROMISE ME YOU WILL DO THIS.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE SUPREMECOURT, I THINK, IS JUST SO OUT
OF TOUCH WITH REALITY.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELL, UNFORTUNATELY
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO SUPPORTFOR THAT SENTIMENT.
BUT NO, CONTINUE.
(LAUGHTER)>> BUT THERE ARE, AND IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.
AND I MEAN, THAT'S PART OFWHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT.
IS THAT, NOT ONLY DOES IT NOTMAKE SENSE NOW, BUT YOU KNOW,
THROUGHOUT AMERICAN HISTORYFOR THE FIRST 200 YEARS WHEN
YOU SAID CORRUPTION, PEOPLETHOUGHT, INCLUDING THE
SUPREME COURT, OH, YOU MEANALL THE KINDS OF WAYS IN
WHICH MONEY CAN BASICALLYTEMPT PUBLIC, YOU KNOW,
POLITICIANS AWAY FROMSERVING THE PUBLIC.
AND IT'S NOT JUST IN BRIBES...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S INCLUDING IN LEGAL WAYS.
AND THE SUPREME COURT NOWSAYS IT IS ONLY IF BASICALLY
I WRITE YOU A CONTRACTSAYING JOHN, WILL YOU PLEASE
MENTION, YOU KNOW, CRESTTOOTHPASTE, OR WHATEVER, IN
THIS OR THAT.
>> Jon: I WOULDNEVER-- ALTHOUGH IT DOES
REALLY POLISH TEETH.
SO WHY THIS CHANGE?
BECAUSE YOU SORT OF CHART ITFROM BEN FRANKLIN'S SNUFF
BOX THAT HE RECEIVES FROMFRANCE WITH DIAMONDS IN IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND HOW THAT REGISTEREDAS CORRUPTION BACK IN THE DAY.
AND HOW THIS SUPREME COURTHAS NARROWED THAT
DEFINITION.
>> YEAH, I REALLY try -- I SPENTA LOT OF TIME TRYING TO
FIGURE THIS OUT.
LIKE HOW DID THEY GET SO OUTTO LUNCH ON THIS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I THINK SOME OF IT ISTHAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
POLITICIANS ON THE COURT ANYMORE.
THAT MAY SEEM SORT OFPERVERSE.
BUT LIKE TAFT...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NOW TAFT UNDERSTOODMONEY AND POLITICS.
SO WHEN A MONEY AND POLITICSCASE CAME TO HIM HE SAID WE
HAVE A REAL THREAT OFCORRUPTION RIGHT HERE.
AND RIGHT NOW THE MODERNCOURT IS MOSTLY ACADEMICS AND
APPELLATE COURT JUSTICES.I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.
PART OF IT IS THEY DON'TACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT,
THEY'RE NOT MAKING THEIRDECISIONS BASED ON FACTS.
JUST-- BUT NO, BUT -->> SURE, OKAY.
>> BUT IN CITIZEN'S UNITEDAND IN McCUTCHEN, THESE TWO
RECENT CASES, THEY ACTUALLYDIDN'T BUILD, YOU KNOW,
WHAT WE CALL A RECORD.
THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TOCONGRESS MEMBERS TALK,
LISTEN TO POLITICIANS TALK.
BECAUSE IF YOU TALK TOPOLITICIANS THEY WILL ALL TELL
YOU WHAT IS WRONG.
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT THAT'S THEPOINT.
YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT ALITTLE BIT, BACKSTAGE, THE
CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF HAVINGTO SPEND FOUR TO SIX HOURS A
DAY FUND-RAISING, FORGET ABOUTTHE QUID PRO QUO OF WHAT
THEY MAY WANT YOU TO DO.
HOW DOES ONE GOVERN, HOWDOES ONE DO THEIR JOB WHEN
SO OF OF THEIR JOB ISSPENT SEARCHING FOR MONEY.
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO.
AND THE OTHER PART OF YOURJOB AS A POLITICIAN IS TO
LISTEN.
IS TO SORT OF BEAR WITNESSTO PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEN
LEAD AND THEN LEARN FROMTHAT.
AND THERE'S NO TIME FOR THATAND FUND-RAISING AND
GOVERNING.
AND THESE ARE ALL PARTS OF,YOU KNOW, THE INITIAL
AMERICAN IDEA, WHICH I'MVERY ATTACHED TO.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE CANDO THINGS ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'S ANUNBELIEVABLE SEGUE.
WHY DON'T I THROW TO COMMERCIAL,AND THEN WHEN WE COME BACK
ON THE WEB, YOU WILL TELL USWHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM ATTIMES, YOU KNOW, I THINK
PEOPLE LOSE HEART.
I THINK THEY SEE THAT EVENTHE PEOPLE THAT THEY REALLY
RESPECT AND THEY REALLY LOVEFALL PREY TO THIS LARGE
MONEY INFLUENCE.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO WHEN WE COME BACKWE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.
THE BOOK GIVES AN INCREDIBLYDETAILED AND I THINK VERY
WELL THOUGHT OUT EXPLANATIONOF THE WHOLE SITUATION.
"CORRUPTION IN AMERICA," IT'S ONTHE BOOK SHELVES NOW,
