YEP.
THANK YOU.
WE OF COURSE ARE FOCUSING ON TODAY'S COVERAGE OF EVENTS.
WE'LL START WITH JESSICA WILLIAMS DOWN AT THE CAPITAL.
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE SPEECH?
>> HELLO, JON.
JON, I LOVED IT.
OKAY.
IT WAS FRESH.
IT WAS NEW.
IT WAS UNEXPECTED.
YET VERY CLASSY.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THE SPEECH REALLY HELPED FRAME THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA.
AND AN INTERESTING AND I THINK SEXY -- PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT WORD -- BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT ANYWAY.
IN A SEXY WAY
>> Jon: I GET IT.
I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOUR NEW BANGS
>> OH, JON, I'M NOT.
WHAT?
OH, YOU MEAN MY BA-B AND.
BA-BANGS
>> Jon: IT'S A GREAT NEW LOOK.
CLEARLY THE FIRST LADY...
>> NO, JON.
THE FIRST LADY.
I'VE BEEN SPORTING THIS FOR AGES.
>> Jon: THAT'S TERRIFIC.
WE'LL GO TO AL MADRIGAL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE IS GOING TO HELP US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AL MADRIGAL.
>> JON, WITH MANY OF OBAMA'S CLOSEST ADVISORS SET TO LEAVE...
>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU HERE.
I THINK WE'RE ALL SLIGHTLY DISTRACTED BY...
>> BY MY B-B-B-B-BANGS Jon: YES, YOUR B-B-B-BANGS YOU DON'T LIKE THEM?
BE HONEST.
IF YOU'RE NOT HONEST, WE HAVE NOTHING
>> Jon: HONESTLY, AL, IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE LOOK FOR YOU
>> SO NOW I'M FAT Jon: I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
LET'S GO OUT TO JASON JONES.
HE IS COVERING THINGS FROM THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE.
JASON
>> THANK YOU, JON.
THE CLEAR LOSER TODAY, AMERICAN VALUES.
I THINK THAT THE AMERICA THAT I GREW UP...
>> Jon: JASON, YOU'RE CANADIAN.
LET ME FINISH.
THAT I GREW UP ABOVE.
THAT AMERICA IS GONE.
I DON'T CARE FOR THIS NEW B-B-B-BANGS AMERICAN.
MEN CAN MARRY MEN.
SINGLE WOMEN CAN GET HEALTH INSURANCE ON PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
WHAT'S NEXT?
POLYGAMY AND DREAD LOCKS?
WHERE DOES IT END
>> Jon: YOU'RE REPRESENTING THAT VIEWPOINT WITH RUE McCLANAHAN'S LOOK?
>> THIS IS NANCY REAGAN.
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT?
RUE WORE FLORAL PRINT.
>> I HAVE TO BREAK IN HERE Jon: AL THIS IS AN ATTACK ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND ONE OF
HER... ONE OF MY VERY DEAR FRIENDS MICHELLE OBAMA.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT.
>> MADRIGAL CAMPAIGN EMAILS ISN'T FRIENDSHIP, PAL
>> SHUT UP, NANCY.
NOT JUST CAMPAIGN EMAILS.
WE TALK ALL THE TIME ON THE PHONE, FACEBOOK.
WE'VE BEEN CLOSE FOR THREE YEARS AFTER MEETING ON TWITTER.
>> (LAUGHING) OH, MY GOD.
Jon: AL, HAVE YOU ACTUALLY MET THE FIRST LADY IN PERSON?
>> NOT IN PERSON BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET.
SHE'S ON BUSY.

>> NO.

NO!

WE'LL BE RIGHT
