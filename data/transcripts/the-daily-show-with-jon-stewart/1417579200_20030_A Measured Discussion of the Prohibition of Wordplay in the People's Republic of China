[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS YOU KNOW.
CHINA, CHINA IS A LAND OF GREATCOMPLEXITY FROM CIVIL RIGHTS
ISSUES TO ENVIRONMENTALCHALLENGES TO WILDLIFE THAT
APPARENTLY CAN'T WORK UP THEENERGY TO [BLEEP] EACH OTHER.
BUT NOW THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC ISTACKLING WHAT MAY BE ITS MOST
PRESSING PROBLEM.
>> THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIAWATCHDOG AGENCY IN CHINA HAS
LAUNCHED A CRACKDOWN ON PUNS.
>> Jon: THE GREAT CHAIRMAN SAYSFROM NOW ON ALL MEANINGS MUST BE
LITERAL AND ALL ENTENDREMUST BE SINGLE.
SINGLE I SAY! THERE WILL BE NOPUNS.
OH NO, THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S APUN.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT.
THAT'S ACTUALLY A PUN. YOU HEARME?
WE DON'T WANT TO OFFEND OURCHINESE OVERLORDS.
SO CAN WE JUST -- NO, THAT'SSTILL A PUN.
THAT'S NOT ANY BETTER.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HEWAS TURKIC.
HE NEVER GOT CLOSERTHAN A HUNDRED MILES FROM CHINA.
SO I DON'T -- THAT --
YES, THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY NICE. YES.
NOW, CHINA'S WORD PLAY POLICYMAY SEEM FRIVOLOUS TO THOSE OF
US IN THE WEST.
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FOR THEPUBLIC'S OWN GOOD.
>> THE CRACK DOWN COMES OVERCONCERNS THAT PUNS MIGHT CREATE
"MISUNDERSTANDING FOR THE PUBLICESPECIALLY FOR MINORS."
>> Jon: NOW SEE, THAT'S WHAT IDON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WOULD PUNS BE ESPECIALLYCONFUSING TO MINERS?
NOW, ADMITTEDLY THEY'RE WORKINGVERY HARD -- OH MY GOD I'M
DOING AGAIN. I'M DOING IT AGAIN.
I'M SO SORRY, SON OF A BITCH! IAPOLOGIZE.
NO, THAT'S STILL A PUN. YOU'REDOING IT AGAIN.
THAT'S NOT -- PUT IT BACK TO THE--
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHING]THIS IS SO HARD.
[LAUGHING]WHY DOES THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT HATE PUNS SO MUCH?
WHY DO THEY WORRY IS GONNAHAPPEN?
>> IT WARNS WORD JOKES CONFUSEAND MISLEAD THE PUBLIC AND
COULD LEAD TO "CULTURAL ANDLINGUISTIC CHAOS."
>> Jon: IT'S TRUE.
IT'S LIKE THAT TIME AMELIABEDELIA WAS TOLD TO MAKE SPRING
ROLLS FOR THE VISITING POLISHAMBASSADOR AND SHE STUFFED
HIM WITH ACTUAL SPRINGS. OH,AMELIA BEDELIA, I'M AFRAID YOUR
USUALLY DELIGHTFULMISUNDERSTANDINGS CAUSED A
INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT ANDUNFORTUNATELY TO EASE THE
TENSIONS -- IT'S OKAY.
WHEN THEY TOLD HER SHE WASFACING A FIRING SQUAD SHE
THOUGHT THEY WEREMAKING POTTERY.
SO SHE'S -- LOOK, I'M NO CHINAEXPERT.
PEOPLE.
PERHAPS THEIR GOVERNMENT TRULYFEARS THAT THEIR COUNTRY
RISKS BEING OVERRUNBY A SCOURGE OF PEKING DUCKS, OR
KOI PONDS, OR GREEN TEA.
BUT CHINA, CONSIDER FOR A MOMENTWHAT YOU MIGHT BE LOSING.
THE PUN IS A RICH LITERARYTRADITION.
ONE BRACED, HONED AND PERFECTEDBY THE LIKES OF SHAKESPEARE.
JOHN DONNE. JAMES JOYCE. THE PUNIS A LINGUISTIC DANCE.
WIT PIROUETTING IN THE SPACEWHERE SOUND MEETS MEANING.
ESPECIALLY ELEGANT IN ALANGUAGE AS SUBTLE AND COMPLEX
AS CHINESE. WHERE A SIMPLEADJUSTMENT IN TONE CAN
UP END THE ENTIREESSENCE OF A PHRASE.
A WORLD WITHOUT THE PUN THAT,GOOD SIR, IS NO WORLD AT ALL.
>> JOKERS IN CHINA CONSIDERYOURSELF WARNED.
YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO PUN.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I STANDCORRECTED.
BAN THAT [BLEEP].
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
