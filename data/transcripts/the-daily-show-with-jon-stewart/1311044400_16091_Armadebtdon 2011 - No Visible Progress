>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST IS DANIEL RADCLIFFE.
THE STAR OF THE NEW FLICK
HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF
BILLION DOLLARS IN WORLDWIDE
WEEKEND GROSS.
SO EXCITING TONIGHT.
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING
SCIENTIFICALLY I DIDN'T KNOW
WAS POSSIBLE.
A CANADIAN WITH BREED WITH A
GERMAN.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THEY FIT
THEM TOGETHER.
THEY'VE CREATED A NEW SPECIES
OF CANAD-ERMAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO FOOLING AROUND.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, OF
COURSE, THE DEBT CEILING.
OUR ONGOING SEGMENT.
THAT IS IN NO WAY HYPERBOLIC.
AS AMERICA MOVES CLOSER TO
LAYING OUT A BLANKET IN FRONT
OF OUR GARAGE AND SELLING OFF
ALL OUR OLD BOARD GAMES IT HAS
BECOME CLEAR THAT TIME FOR
ACTION IS SHORT.
>> THEATE PRESIDENT SAYS HE
WANTS AN AGREEMENT.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SET A
DEADLINE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA NOW SAYS
IT'S DECISION TIME.
>> Jon: SNAP, COMMANDER IN
CHIEF THROWING DOWN A
DEADLINE.
ON FRIDAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES BROKE OUT HIS "I
MEAN BUSINESS" PODIUM.
>> WE ARE OBVIOUSLY RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.
SO WHAT I'VE SAID TO THE
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IS THAT
YOU NEED OVER THE NEXT 24 TO
36 HOURS TO GIVE ME SOME SENSE
OF WHAT YOUR PLAN IS TO GET
THE DEBT CEILING RAISED
THROUGH WHATEVER MECHANISMS
THEY CAN THINK ABOUT.
>> Jon: DAMN!
REPUBLICANS, YOU OWE ME A 24
TO MOST LIKELY 36 HOURS TO BE
ALL...
WE WERE KIND OF THINKING OF
MAYBE...
DAMN!
AND IF YOU DON'T, THERE IS A
STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT YOU
WILL BE ASKED AGAIN, YOU KNOW.
FOR AT LEAST SOME SENSE OF
WHAT YOUR PLAN IS BECAUSE...
ANYWHO.
ALL RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT WHEN
HE DOES LAY DOWN THE SNACKDOWN
AND SAY YOU'VE GOT 24 TO 36
HOURS AND HE TELLS YOU THAT ON
FRIDAY CERTAINLY BY MONDAY
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME
PROGRESS.
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU, JEFF.
NO TALKS SCHEDULED AT LEAST AS
OF YET FOR TODAY AND NO
VISIBLE PROGRESS OVER THE
WEEKEND.
>> Jon: AHA!
NO "VISIBLE" PROGRESS.
SO VISIBLE.
ALL THE PROGRESS OVER THE
WEEKEND TOOK PLACE IN THE
MICROBIAL WORLD.
REPUBLICAN BACTERIA QUITE
BUSY.
ANAEROBICCALLY... I'M BEING
TOLD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
EITHER.
WHY WON'T REPUBLICANS
NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH?
IS IT BECAUSE THEY PERHAPS
SENSE IN THE STAND OFF THE
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH DOWN THIS
PRESIDENCY TO THE SPUTTERING
ECONOMY HASTENING OBAMA'S
INEXORABLE SLIDE TO ONE
TERMSMANSHIP OR PERHAPS IS IT
SOMETHING THAT IT CLEARLY
ISN'T.
>> WHY HAS THE DEBT LIMIT BEEN
RAISED 60 TIMES?
WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS
PRESIDENT?
THAT SHOULD PUT HIM IN A
POSITION THAT HE SHOULD NOT
RECEIVE THE SAME KIND OF
RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF WHEN
IT IS NECESSARY TO RAISE THE
DEBT LIMIT IN ORDER TO PAY OUR
BILLS.
WHY IS HE DIFFERENT?
>> Jon: HE'S THE FIRST
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO OWN A
PORTUGUESE WATER DOG?
HE VOTED AGAINST RAISING THE
DEBT CEILING IN 2006?
WAIT.
THAT CAN'T BE IT.
JUST TELL US.
>> WHY IS THIS PRESIDENT BEING
TREATED SO DISRESPECTFULLY?
I AM PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO
THE FACT THAT ONLY THIS
PRESIDENT, ONLY THIS ONE, ONLY
THIS ONE HAS RECEIVED THE KIND
OF ATTACKS AND DISAGREEMENTS
AND INABILITY TO WORK, ONLY
THIS ONE.
READ BETWEEN THE LINES.
>> Jon: READ BETWEEN THE
LINES?
I CAN'T EVEN FOCUS.
YOUR SHIRT IS LIKE AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION FOR GOD'S SAKES.
YOUR SHIRT IS LIKE ONE OF THEM
PAGE I CAN EYE POSTERS.
MAYBE IF I JUST STARE AT YOUR
SHIRT, I'LL FIGURE OUT.
OH!
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
SAY.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S IT.
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST SAY THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
