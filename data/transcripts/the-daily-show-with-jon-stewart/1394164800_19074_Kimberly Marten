>> WELCOME BACK, MY GUESTTONIGHT, SHE IS A POLITICAL
SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT BARNARDCOLLEGE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY,
SHE HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUTTHE CRISIS IN UKRAINE FROM
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MAGAZINE,PLEASE WELCOME KIMBERLY
MARTIN.
HELLO.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,FOR SOMEONE WHO STUDIES THIS
REGION, THIS MUST BEHORRIFYING AND EXCITING AT
THE SAME TIME.
>> WHEN THINGS GET BAD THERETHEY GET GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO
STUDY IT.
>> Jon: GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHOSTUDY IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT I KNOWABOUT THE SITUATION.
PUTIN HAS WON.
HE HAS THROUGH SHREWDLEADERSHIP AND A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF SENSITIVITY OFNIPPLE, HE HAS BROUGHT THE
WEST TO ITS KNEES ANDRECONSTITUTED THE SOVIET
UNION.
HOW CORRECT AM I?
>> NO, IN FACT, THAT'SABSOLUTELY WRONG.
HE LOST AND NOBODY CANFIGURE OUT WHY HE TOOK SUCH
BIG RISK FOR SUCH LITTLEGAIN.
>> NOW THAT HE'S ANINTERESTING TAKE, THAT YOU
HAVE, WHEN YOU SAY IT'S ABIG RISK, WHAT HAS HE
RISKED?
>> WELL, IMMEDIATELY HE'SRISK THAT A GUNSHOT GOES OFF,
NOT JUST ONE THAT GETS INTOTHE SKY BUT ONE THAT IS, FOR
EXAMPLE, FIRED BY A DRUNKSOLDIER, THAT CAUSES THE
WHOLE THING TO BLOW AND UKRAINETO BE IN A CIVIL WAR
WITH RUSSIAN TROOPS THERE.
BUT MORE THAN THAT, HE HASNOW GIVEN UP THE ONE PIECE
OF POWER THAT RUSSIA REALLYHAD AFTER THE COLD WAR THAT
HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE WHICHWAS THE VETO IN THE U.N.
SECURITY COUNCIL.
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BOTHER TOGO TO THE U.N. BEFORE HE
DECIDED TO MAKE THISMILITARY MOVE AND THEN
NOBODY IS GOING TO BELIEVERUSSIA EVER AGAIN WHEN THEY
SAY BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TOTHE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL
FIRST.
>> AW.
BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS,THEY ARE NOT THERE
MILITARILY.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I UNDERSTAND THAT, YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU CAN GO OUT ANDBUY RUSSIAN MILITARY
UNIFORMS.
>> YES, YES, SO I'VE HEARD.
>> Jon: AND YOU CAN LEARNRUSSIAN VERY QUICKLY IF YOU
WANT TO.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Jon: THIS IS COMPLICATEDFOR NOT JUST RUSSIA BECAUSE
YOU TALK ABOUT PUTIN HASGIVEN UP THE MORAL GROUND IF
HE INDEED HAD ANY.
HOW TOUGH IS IT FOR US TOSAY LET'S SAY PUTIN WANTS TO
TURN IT AROUND ON US AND SAY
I ONLY WENT IN TO CRIMEABECAUSE THIS IS A REGION
THAT WANTS TO BE PART OF THERUSSIAN FEDERATION.
WANTS TO BE INDEPENDENT,LIKE YOU WENT INTO IRAQ, WE
ARE MERELY SPREADINGDEMOCRACY IN THIS REGION.
>> WELL, THERE IS APROCEDURE THAT SHOULD BE
FOLLOWED THROUGHINTERNATIONAL LAW AND, IN
FACT, UKRAINE HAD ALREADYPLANNED THAT IT WAS GOING TO
HAVE A DISCUSSION OFCHANGING THE AUTONOMOUS
STATUS OF CRIMEA AFTER THEMAY ELECTIONS THAT WERE
COMING UP.
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT ISACTUALLY RELATIVELY A
DEMOCRACY.
THEY DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW THEPROCEDURES CONSTITUTIONALLY
WHEN THEY GOT RID OFYANUKOVYCH, THE OLD LEADER
BUT THE WAY THEY PUT INPLACE THE NEW LEADERSHIP WAS
BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF APARLIAMENT THAT WAS ELECTED
IN AN ELECTION.
AND SO UKRAINE IS ALREADY ADEMOCRACY.
>> DOES THAT COMPLICATEUKRAINE'S OPTIONS HERE IF
CRIMEA SAYS WE HAVE THROUGHA POPULAR UPRISING
OVERTHROWN THE UKRAINIANLEADERSHIP AND CHOSEN TO BE
PART OF THE RUSSIANFEDERATION, DOES UKRAINE
HAVE A LEG TO STAND ON WHENTHEY SAY BUT THAT'S NOT
CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THEYJUST DID A SIMILAR MANEUVER.
>> BUT THERE IS ADIFFERENCE.
BECAUSE WHAT CRIMEA DID ATTHE POINT THAT THE RUSSIANS
HAD STARTED GOING IN WAS TOREPLACE THEIR LEADERSHIP
WITH A NEW LEADER SO THATPART WAS PARALLEL TO WHAT
HAD HAPPENED IN KIEV AND THEMAJOR PART OF UKRAINE.
BUT THE IDEA OF JUSTBREAKING AWAY AS A PROVINCE
GOING OFF ON ITS OWN,THAT-- THAT IS NOT IN ANY
KIND OF INTERNATIONAL LEGALFRAMEWORK THAT HAS TO COME
WITH THE PERMISSION, THEDISCUSSION OF THE ENTIRE
POPULATION OF UKRAINE, NOTJUST THE PROVINCE BY ITSELF.
>> HOW COMPLICATED WOULD IT BEIF YOU HELD THAT DISCUSSION
WITH THE ENTIRE PROVINCE.
BECAUSE I KNOW LISTEN, I'MSURE THE KURDS ARE WATCHING
THIS AND THINKING I DIDN'TKNOW YOU COULD DO THAT.
I WAS-- I-- IN IRAQ, PART OFTURKEY THERE ARE MANY
REGIONS WHERE THERE IS AMAJORITY POPULATION, PERHAPS
NOT IN CONTROL POLITICALLYTHAT WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH
THEIR AUTONOMY ETHNICALLY.
>> BUT YOU KNOW, ONLY 58% OFTHE PEOPLE IN CRIMEA ARE
ETHNICALLY RUSSIAN OR SO WETHINK FROM THE 2001 CENSUS.
THERE IS A BIG MINORITY OFCRIMEAN TATARS-- WHO WEREREALLY
JUST FACED TERRIBLEPERSECUTION THROUGHOUT THE
SOVIET PERIOD, NOW HAVE-- .
>> Jon: SO NOT -- THEY ARENOT NEUTRAL TOWARDS RUSSIA,
THEY ARE-- THEY ARE ACTIVELYHOSTILE.
>> FRIGHTENED OF RUSSIA.
AND THEY HAVE EXPLICITLYSAID THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
FORM OF A LITTLE INFORMALDEMOCRATIC GROUP THAT GETS
TOGETHER AND MEETS. AND THEY'VE
SAID IN THIS GROUPING THEYSUPPORT UKRAINE AND THEY
WANT UKRAINE AND THE ENTIREPOPULATION OF UKRAINE TO BE
INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND, YOUKNOW, LOOK, RUSSIA DID THIS
IN GEORGIA.
BUT GEORGIA IS NOWHERE NEARTHE MILITARY OF THE UKRAINE.
I MEAN UKRAINE IS ANENORMOUS COUNTRY IN AND OF
ITSELF WITH A VERY WELLESTABLISHED MILITARY.
>> YES.
THE MILITARY IN UKRAINE ISNOT AS STRONG AS WE MIGHT
LIKE IT TO BE.
BUT THEY'VE CERTAINLYCOOPERATED WITH THE U.S. AND
NATO ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'REHOLDING.
AND THAT'S THE ONE REALLYPOSITIVE THING THAT GIVES
STABILITY IN THIS SITUATION.
BUT THE GROUND FORCES ARESTILL HOLDING THAT LITTLE
PIECE OF LAND THAT CONNECTSCRIMEA TO THE REST OF
UKRAINE.
WHEN THAT NAVAL COMMANDERSAID HE WAS DEFECTING TO THE
CRIMEAN SIDE NONE OF THEOFFICERS WENT WITH HIM.
WHEN RUSSIAN HELICOPTERS TRYTO GO FROM THE CRIMEAN PART OF
THE COUNTRY INTO THE REST OFUKRAINE, THEY WERE STOPPED
BY THE UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE,SO FAR THAT MEANS IT IS A
CONTAINED PROBLEM.
>> Jon: SO BASICALLY PUTINHAS WON AND THE WEST IS
WEAK.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
WILL YOU STICK AND FOR ALITTLE BIT.
WE'LL TALK BRIEFLY MORE, ACOUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO
ASK YOU.
KIMBERLY MARTIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
