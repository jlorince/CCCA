(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT,WEHAVE ON OUR PROGRAM
MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR ELIZABETHWARREN
AND I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THATSHE IS, IN FACT, AND THIS IS,
AND I JUST FOUND THIS OUT, SHEIS RUNNING... ON TIME TONIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)OH, MISDIRECT.
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ASAYING FOR SOMETHING
YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT SEEMS ALITTLE OFF, STRANGE, AND
YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, OH, WE'RENOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.
IT'S AN EXPRESSION THATORIGINATED I BELEIVE
WHEN THE BASE PLAYERAND DRUMMER WERE FIRED
FROM KANSAS.
(LAUGHTER)I BELIEVE THEY MAY HAVE TURNED
TO EACH OTHER AND SAID, WE'RENOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.
THE POINT BEING, KANSAS IS OURSTANDARD BEARER OF NORMALCY
TO SOME EXTENT, YOUR GOOD OLDFASHIONED AVERAGE
AMERICAN STATE. RIGHT NOW IT'SRUN BY GOVERNOR SAM BROWNBACK
WHO HAS WALKED THE WALKOF HIS CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES
AND TRANSFORMED THE STATE INTOA VERITABLE RIGHT UTOPIA,
LOW TAXES AND DEREGULATION FOREVERYTHING!
>> KANSAS GOVERNOR SAM BROWNBACKHAS SIGNED A NEW CONCEALED
WEAPONS LAW FOR KANSAS.
>> THE MEASURE ELIMINATES THEEIGHT HOURS OF TRAINING
PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED BY STATE LAWAND THE NEED TO CARRY A PERMIT.
>> THAT'S EIGHT HOURS YOU COULDHAVE ALREADY BEEN SHOOTING
STUFF! (LAUGHTER)
JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE SAME STATETHAT BELIEVES EIGHT HOURS
OF GUN TRAINING IS TOOMUCH FOR ITS GUN OWNERS,
OF GUN TRAINING IS TOOMUCH FOR ITS GUN OWNERS,
REQUIRES A THOUSAND HOURS OFTRAINING FOR ITS
PROFESSIONAL ESTHETICIANS. I'LLTELL YOU WHY,
YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFULWITH HOT WAX AND BUTT HAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S UH -- WE'VE ALL BEENTHERE.
THAT'S A STOCK PHOTO.
BUT BEFORE THE NEW GUN RULESMAKE YOU GO AND CANCEL YOUR TRIP
TO SEE KANSAS'S FAMED BARBEDWIRE MUSEUM,
WHICH IS A REAL MUSEUM INKANSAS,
THERE'S NO NEED FOR KANSASSHOOTERS TO GO TO SAFETY SCHOOL.
>> BROWNBACK SAID HE SIGNED THEBILL INTO LAW BECAUSE KANSAS GUN
OWNERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY'RERESPONSIBLE.
>> NO, THAT'S THE REASON YOUALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO GET A
HAMSTER. OH, YOU'VE SHOWN YOU'RERESPONSIBLE.
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THEHAMSTER.
AND BY THE WAY, EVEN THEN YOU'REGOING TO WANT TO KEEP A COUPLE
OF SHOEBOXES AROUND.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
WHY IS THAT KID STILL SMILING?
HE NEVER CHANGES EXPRESSIONS.
HE HAD A LIVE HAMSTER, AND NOW ADEAD --
DOESN'T CARE.
WHY WOULD KANSAS DO THIS?
>> ONE OF THE BILL'S SPONSORSSAY REMOVING THE TRAINING
REQUIREMENT MIGHT ACTUALLYIMPROVE THE TRAINING.
>> SITTING IN A CLASSROOM WHEREYOU'RE JUST BASICALLY THE STATE
IS LECTURING YOU ON WHAT THE LAWIS, ON WHAT YOU SHOULD AND
SHOULDN'T DO TO ABSOLVETHEMSELVES FROM THE LIABILITY.
>> Jon: WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAYINGYOU IMPROVE THE TRAINING BY
GETTING RID OF THE TRAINING --I DON'T NEED SOME DAMN
GOVERNMENT EGG HEAD GUNINSTRUCTOR TELLING ME WHAT
TO DO! I GO TO THE SCHOOLOF TRIAL AND ERROR JUST
LIKE MY GRANDPA ONE-NUT BOBBY --ONE-NUT BOBBY -- ONE-NUT BOBBY
COUTURE-LOVELADY!
IS THAT -- COUTURE-LOVELADY!
(LAUGHTER)WHAT IS TRAVIS COUTURE-LOVELADY
DOING IN THE KANSAS STATEHOUSE WHEN HE SHOULD BE RUNNING
HIS OWN FANCY HAT STORE IN THEFRENCH QUARTER?
(LAUGHTER)EMBRACE YOUR DESTINY TRAVIS
COUTURE-LOVELADY! THE MILLINERYARTS NEED YOU.
NOW, NORMALLY AT THIS POINT INTHE NEWS STORY YOU TROT OUT SOME
TOKEN LEFTIES TO TALK ABOUTHOW TERRIBLE AN IDEA CUTTING
THE GUN SAFETY REQUIREMENT IS,BUT ON THIS ISSUE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO VERY FARLEFT.
>> EVEN SOME GUN OWNERS WEFOUND AT A SHOOTING RANGE AGREE
REMOVING THE GUN TRAINING TAKESTHINGS TOO FAR.
BUT LAWMAKERS SAY THEY'REERRING ON THE SIDE OF FREEDOM.
>> Jon: WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEYSAY ABOUT GUNS, BETTER SORRY
THAN SAFE.
BUT, IT'S NICE TO KNOW WE BOTHAGREE YOU'RE ERRING.
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT GOVERNORBROWNBACK ORGANIZING A
STATEWIDE GAME OF HIDE ANDSHOOT,
IT IS AN OUTGROWTH OF THECONFIDENCE GOVERNOR BROWNBACK
FEELS IN FELLOW KANSANS.
LIKE WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICEAND CUT TAXES IN 2012 AND SAYING
"HIS FAITH WAS IN THE PEOPLE OFKANSAS NOT THE GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE KNOW BETTERHOW TO SPEND THEIR MONEY.
SAM BROWNBACK TRUSTS THE GOODPEOPLE OF KANSAS.
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF KANSASWHO AREN'T GOOD?
WE KNOW THE POOR ONES.
>> GOVERNOR BROWNBACK ISEXPECTED TO SIGN A NEW BILL INTO
LAW THIS WEEK.
IT WOULD PUT LIMITS ON WHEREPEOPLE RECEIVING WELFARE CAN
SPEND THEIR GOVERNMENTASSISTANCE.
>> Jon: AHHH!
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE POORPEOPLE, WE'RE DECIDING TO ERR ON
THE SIDE OF FIEFDOM.
IT USED TO BE THAT KANSASBARRED WELFARE MONEY FROM WHAT
WERE CONSIDERED DESTRUCTIVEBEHAVIORS, YOUR ALCOHOL,
YOUR GAMBLING, YOUR SMOKING.
NOW KANSAS HAS DECIDED TO EXPANDTHE RESTRICTIONS.
>> ASSISTANCE WON'T BE ALLOWEDAT PLACES LIKE MOVIETHEATERS,
SWIMMING POOLS.
>> LINGERIE SHOPS, PSYCHIC ORFORTUNE TELLER BUSINESSES.
>> CRUISE SHIPS.
>> THEME PARKS.
>> AND NAIL SALONS.
>> Jon: OH, SO IF YOU'RE ONWELFARE IN KANSAS YOU CAN CROSS
THIS MALL OFF YOUR LIST.
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE
FUN ACCESSORY YOU CAN STILLGET WITH RELIEF MONEY.
>> GUNS AND AMMO.
>> Jon: IT'S TRUE, YOU'RE POORBUT YOU'RE STILL AN AMERICAN.
SO, BASICALLY THE BROWNBACKPRINCIPLE IS THAT GOVERNMENT HAS
NO RIGHT TO DICTATE TO YOUHOW TO SPEND YOUR MONEY
OR HOLD YOUR GUN.
SOME PEOPLE MAY DO IT LIKETHIS OR SOME LIKE THIS OR
LIKE THIS -- IT'S YOUR CHOICE!
UNTIL YOU'RE ON THE DOLE.
THEN YOU FORFEIT THOSEINALIENABLE RIGHTS AND THE
GOVERNMENT CAN THEN AT THATPOINT STEP IN AND TREAT YOU
LIKE A BAD CHILD.
YOU HAVEN'T RECOVERED FROM THENATIONAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE?
[BLEEP] YOU. NO MOVIES.
IT SHOULD ONLY BE FOR WHAT YOUNEED!
AND THE GOVERNMENT GETS TO TELLYOU WHAT YOU NEED!
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR POINT,FOR KANSAS TO BE MAKING THIS
DECISION IS A LITTLE STRANGEBECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST
FIGURES AVAILABLE, FOR EVERYDOLLAR KANSAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT MOOCHEDROUGHLY $1.29.
AND KANSAS MIGHT SAY HEY, TRUSTUS, WE KNOW BEST HOW TO MANAGE
OUR MONEY, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEMLIKE YOU DO.
>> TWO KANSAS SCHOOL DISTRICTSSAY THEY HAVE TO CLOSE EARLY
BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT OF MONEY.
>> CUTS TAKE MONEY AWAY FROMHIGHWAY REPAIR PROJECTS.
>> GOVERNOR BROWNBACK ISPROPOSING TO REDUCE THE STATE'S
CONTRIBUTION TO THEEMPLOY PENSION PROGRAM.
>> THE PROPOSED BUDGETINCLUDES CUTS FOR THE JAZZ
MUSEUM AND THE ZOO.
>> BARBED WIRE MUSEUM IS STILLSAFE THOUGH RIGHT?
I MEAN, WIFE AND I HAVE ANANNIVERSARY COMING UP.
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S THE FACT, KANSAS, YOU'RE
ON THE DOLE.
AND IF YOU NEED TO TAKE TAXMONEY FROM NEW YORK AND ILLINOIS
THAT'S OKAY, JUST REMEMBER THEFACT THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE SHOWS YOUCAN'T BE TRUSTED TO MAKE YOUR
OWN DECISIONS. I NOTICED THATWHILE YOU'RE ON WELFARE YOU'RE
STILL HAVING FUN.
WE'D LOVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OFFREEDOM FOR KANSAS BUT FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD I THINK WE HAVE TOPLACE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON HOW
YOU CAN SPEND THAT STATEWELLFARE.
FOR INSTANCE, YOUR STATE HAS APRETTY FLASHY SHAPE.
ALL THOSE EXTRAVAGANT RIGHTANGLES.
THAT'S GONE.
ALL THOSE ROADS PAVED INLUXURIOUS ASPHALT.
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
FROM NOW ON YOUR ROADS WILL BEPAVED WITH USED CONDOMS!
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, AND ALLTHOSE AG SUBSIDIES, INSTEAD OF
WATERING WITH FRESHWATER NOW,THAT'S AN INDULGENCE
TAXPAYERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TOSUPPORT, FROM NOW ON,
JUST URINE. URINE IS THE ONLYTHING.
KANSAS, THESE RULES MAY FEELPETTY AND UNNECESSARY AND
QUITE FRANKLY INSULTING, BUTMAYBE THEY WILL MOTIVATE YOU
TO ESCAPE YOUR CULTURE OFFEDERAL DEPENDENCY BUT UNTIL
THEN LET'S SEE HOW YOU FEELLIKE BEING TREATED LIKE
THE WELFARE QUEENS YOU ARE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
