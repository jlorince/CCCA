BUT FIRST YOU KNOW,.
>> BRIAN WILLIAMS WILL NOTBE IN THE ANCHOR CHAIR THIS
EVENING, AFTER ASELF-IMPOSED SUSPENSION FROM
NBC NIGHTLY NEWS, FOLLOWINGHIS ADMISSION THAT HE
MISLED THE PUBLIC ABOUT HISEXPERIENCES COVERING THE
IRAQ WAR BACK IN 2003.
>> Jon: BRI!
WHY?
(LAUGHTER)WHY, BRI?
WHY, BRI LIE?
SIGH.
(LAUGHTER)WERE YOU BRI HIGH?
CAUSE IF THEY KEEP FINDING[BLEEP] IT'S BRI BYE.
A QUICK RECAP IN CASE YOUARE UNDER 70 AND DON'T
RELIGIOUSLY TURN ON THENETWORK NEWS EVERY NIGHT AT
6:30. DEMO SLAM!
IN 2003 BRIAN WILLIAMSGAVE THIS ORIGINAL REPORT
FROM IRAQ.
>> WE ASKED THE U.S. ARMY TOTAKE US ON AN AIR MISSION
WITH THEM.
THE CHINOOK AHEAD OF USWAS ALMOST BLOWN OUT OF THE
SKY.
THAT HOLE WAS MADE BY AROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE,
OR RPG.
>> Jon: OH.
BUT IN 2013 ON LETTERMAN ITBECAME.
>> TWO OF OUR FOURHELICOPTERS WERE HIT.
BY GROUND FIRE INCLUDING THEONE I WAS IN.
>> NO KIDDING.
>> RPG AND AK-47s.
>> Jon: NO. KIDDING.
SO IN 2015 AS HE RETURNEDTHE STORY TO A NEWS FORMAT
ON HIS SHOW, HE STUCK WITHTHE MORE, WE SAY,
INTERESTING WORKSHOPVERSION.
>> THE STORY ACTUALLYSTARTED WITH A TERRIBLE
MOMENT A DOZEN YEARS BACKDURING THE INVASION OF IRAQ
WHEN THE HELICOPTER WE WERETRAVELING IN WAS FORCED DOWN
AFTER BEING HIT BY AN RPG.
>> Jon: SEE, I SEE THEPROBLEM.
WE'VE GOT US A CASE HERE OFINFOTAINMENT CONFUSION SYNDROME.
IT OCCURS WHEN THE CELEBRITYCORTEX GET ITS WIRES CROSSED
WITH THE MEDULLA ANCHOR DALA.
YOU CAN SEE WHEN IT HAPPENS.WATCH.
SEE HOW IN 2003 HE IS LOOKINGSTRAIGHT IN THE CAMERA, RIGHT?
MEDULLA ANCHORDALA REGULATING IN APPROPRIATE
DETAIL. THAT'S A NEWS STORY.
BUT WHEN HE  IN 2013, NOTICEHOW HE TURNS HIS HEAD?
LOOK HIS HEAD IS TURNED, A 45DEGREE ANGLE,
ACTIVATING THE CELEBR-BELLUM.
THAT'S KNOWN AS THE BRAIN'SAPPLAUSE CENTER.
ONCE THAT ENGAGES, THERE ISNO GOING BACK.
YOU'RE IN FULL BLOWNANECDOTE MODE.
THE TRUTH OF WHAT A REPORTERIS SAYING IS ALL IN THE
DIRECTION THEIR FACE ISTURNED.
NEWS STORY, WAR STORY.
TRUST ME ON THIS.
TOTAL BULL [BLEEP].
TODAY MARKS THE 70thANNIVERSARY, OF THE END OF
WORLD WAR II.
I KNOW BECAUSE I KILLEDHITLER.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S A CLASSIC HE SAID,
HE SAID IT AGAIN ONLETTERMAN BUT WITHOUT THE
FOOTAGE AND A LOT MORE HIM.
BUT LIKE WITH MOST CASES OFMASTURBATION,
TYPICALLY BEING CAUGHT ISPUNISHMENT ENOUGH.
(LAUGHTER)SELF-LOVE CAN BE A BAD
HABIT.
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO IT ATYOUR WORK DESK.
BUT IT'S MORE SIN THAN CRIME,NO, WOULD YOU AGREE?
>> I'M SURE HIS COLLEAGUESWOULD AGREE.
>> WE WILL TAKE YOU THROUGHTHE EVIDENCE STEP-BY-STEP.
>> THE PILOT OF BRIANWILLIAMS' HELICOPTER WILL
JOIN US.
>> WE WILL BE HEARING FROMTWO PILOTS.
>> WE HAVE A MAP TONIGHT. TELLUS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE.
>> BRIAN WILLIAMS DID ANINTERVIEW WITH STARS &
STRIPES.
>> I TALKED TO A SOLDIERLAST NIGHT.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NOWWITH OUR MEDIA EXPERTS.
>> OUR MEDIA PANEL IS HERE
>> WHAT DOES THIS MEANFOR THE INDUSTRY?
>> DID HE LIE?
>> HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE TOHIS CREDIBILITY?
>> Jon: THE MEDIA IS ON IT!
NOW THIS MAY SEEM LIKEOVERKILL BUT FOR ME, NO,
IT'S NOT OVERKILL BECAUSEI'M HAPPY.
FINALLY SOMEONE IS BEINGHELD TO ACCOUNT FOR
MISLEADING AMERICA ABOUT THEIRAQ WAR.
(LAUGHTER)FINALLY.
NOW-- IT MIGHT NOTNECESSARILY--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE
THE FIRST PERSON YOU WOULDWANT HELD ACCOUNTABLE ON
THAT LIST.
BUT NEVER AGAIN WILL BRIANWILLIAMS MISLEAD THIS GREAT
NATION ABOUT BEING SHOT ATIN A WAR WE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE ENDED UP IN IFTHE MEDIA HAD APPLIED
THIS LEVEL OF SCRUTINY TOTHE ACTUAL [BLEEP] WAR.
IN FACT, WHY IS THE MEDIA SOUP IN ARMS?
>> THIS IS A HUGECREDIBILITY CRISIS.
>> CREDIBILITY AND TRUST AREWHAT WE GO OFF OF,
WHAT WE STAND FOR.
>> IF THEY CARE ABOUTCREDIBILITY-- HE SHOULD NO
LONGER BE MANAGING EDITORAND ANCHOR.
>> I'M STUNNED THAT ARE YOUNOT ASKING FOR HIM TO BE
FIRED, MEGYN.
>> REALLY?
>> SOMEONE AS -- ABSOLUTELY.
SOMEONE AS CREDIBLE AS YOU,WHO WHILE VERY ATTRACTIVE
AND ARTICULATE, AT THE CORE,YOU ARE CREDIBLE.
YOU ARE LIKE WALTERCRONKITE KIND OF CREDIBLE.
>> Jon: BUT LIKE WAY HOTTERTHAN CRONKITE, LIKE WAY
HOTTER.
LIKE, YOU'RE LIKE, YOU'RELIKE SUPER-CREDIBLE.
OH MY GOD, DID I SAY THATOUT LOUD?
DO WANT TO GO OUT TODINNER?
YOU ARE SUPER CREDIBLE.
OH MY GOD, THIS IS SUPEREMBARRASSED.
THE MEDIA IS RIGHT TO GOAFTER WILLIAMS LAKE THIS.
IMAGINE IF YOU LET LIES SLIPINTO NEWS STORIES LIKE A
HUGE PILE OF THEM THAT WASDISSEMINATED IN SAY "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" AND "MEET THEPRESS" AND SOMETIMES IN "THE
NEW YORK TIMES" JUST SO THATTHE ADMINISTRATION COULD
THEN GO ON "MEET THE PRESS"AND SAY THIS.
>> THERE'S A STORY IN "THENEW YORK TIMES" THIS MORNING
THAT, IN FACT, HE HAS BEENSEEKING TO ACQUIRE THE KINDS
OF TUBES THAT ARE NECESSARYTO BUILD A CENTRIFUGE AND
THE CENTRIFUGE IS REQUIREDTO TAKE LOW GRADE URANIUM
AND ENHANCE IT, WHICH ISWHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IN
ORDER TO BUILD A BOMB.
>> Jon: AND THE CRAZY THING ISTHE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ARE
THE ONES WHO PLANTED THE[BLEEP] STORY IN "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" IN THE FIRSTPLACE.
THE RUN-UP TO THE IRAQ WARWAS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN THE
EVIL EFFICIENCY OF ITS MEDIAMANIPULATION.
IT'S LIKE THE BUSHADMINISTRATION HIRED TEMPLE
GRANDIN TO DESIGN A MACHINETHAT KILLS THE TRUTH.
SO I LOVE THAT NOW THE MEDIAPRETENDS THAT THEY MUST GUARD
THE CROWN JEWEL OF THEIRCREDIBILITY WHEN WE ALREADY
HAVE SEEN ITS AL CAPONE'SVAULT.
NOT THAT THEY WEREN'T HARDON THEMSELVES POST CLUSTER
[BLEEP].
>> HOW DID YOU GUYS DO ON THEISSUE OF WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION.
>> I THINK WE DID -- I THINK WEDID PRETTY DARN GOOD.
>> I THINK WE WERE PRETTYSTRONG.
>> I THINK THE QUESTIONSWERE ASKED.
>> THERE WAS THE FOG OF WAR.
>> I GUESS WE WERE CAUGHT UPIN THE POST 9/11 SENSE OF
PATRIOTISM.
>> AND THERE IS ALSO THE FOG OFCOVERING THE WAR.
>> COULD WE HAVE DONE ABETTER JOB? SURE.
REMEMBER, WE ARE A FIRSTDRAFT OF HISTORY, JOURNALISM.
>> Jon: BUT IT WASN'T EVENYOUR DRAFT.
YOU WERE JUST COPYING OFF OFCHENEY'S PAPER.
YOU WERE PLAGERIZINGHISTORY.
BUT MAYBE THIS INCIDENT WILLCAUSE REFLECTION ON YOUR
PART.
YOU WILL GO BACK NOW ANDLOOK AT OTHER INSTANCES OF
MEDIA MALFEASANCE THAT LEDOUR COUNTRY TO THE MOST
CATASTROPHIC FOREIGN POLICYDECISION IN DECADES.
>> NBC CONFIRMING IT HASINDEED LAUNCHED AN INTERNAL
INVESTIGATION INTO STORIESTHAT WILLIAMS TOLD.
>> NEW REPORTS TONIGHT CASTDOUBT ON WILLIAMS' POST
HURRICANE KATRINA REPORTING.
>> WILLIAMS REPORTED SEEINGA BODY FLOAT BY IN THE
FRENCH QUARTER BUT THEFRENCH QUARTER WAS NOT AS
SEVERELY FLOODED AT THETIME.
>> NOW THERE IS SOME QUESTIONABOUT WAS HE REALLY MUGGED
AS HE CLAIMED HE WAS WHEN HEWAS SELLING CHRISTMAS TREES
IN RED BANK, NEW JERSEY.
>> STORIES GOING AROUND THAT HESAID EVEN ABOUT RESCUING PUPPIES
FROM A FIRE, WHAT STARTED AS ONEPUPPY THAT HE RESCUED FROM A
FIRE, APPARENTLY MORPHED INTOTWO PUPPIES FROM A FIRE.
>> Jon: DAMMIT BRIANWILLIAMS, ONE PUPPY OR TWO.
DON'T YOU [BLEEP] LIE TO ME!
I WANT THE TRUTH. WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK.
