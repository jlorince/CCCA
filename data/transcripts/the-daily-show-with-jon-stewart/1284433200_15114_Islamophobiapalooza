["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG
PLAYING]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME JON STEWART.
TONIGHT'S GUEST ACTOR AND
DIRECTOR OF THE NEW FILL "THE
TOWN" AND FEW PEOPLE KNOW THIS
HE IS ALSO THE VOICE OF THE
GEEKO LIZARD.
I MADE UP THE LAST PART.
BEN AFFLECK WILL BE JOINING US.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST SO YOU KNOW WIKIPEDIA, I
MADE THAT LAST PART UP.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE WAS SOME UNCERTAINTY ON
HOW AMERICANS WOULD BE REFLECT
ON 9/11.
SPECIFICALLY ONE AMERICAN OUT OF
350 MILLION OR SO TERRY JONES
PASTOR OF GAINESVILLE'S DOVE
WORLD OUTREACH CENTER AND
PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER LIP HAIR
CLUB FOR MEN HOW HE WOULD
OBSERVE THAT DAY.
>> WILL HE BURN THE KORAN WITH
THE FOLLOWER?
>> WHY ARE THE MUSEIMS --
MUSLIMS IN SUP AN UPROAR.
>> HOW COOKIE IS THIS GUY.
>> IS HE GOING TO BURN THE TORAH
NEXT?
>> Jon: WHAT -- NO -- NO,
TORAH BURN BAD!
NOOOOO!
DON'T BURN --
[LAUGHTER]
IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHY ONLY MY
HANDS TURN WHEN I GET ANGRY --
[LAUGHTER]
-- KIND OF A SAD STORY AS A
TEENAGER I WAS EXPOSED TO GAM MA
RAYS IN A MILITARY TEST FACILITY
WHILE MASTURBATING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LADIES, YES, THE GLOVES MATCH
THE DRAPES.
[LAUGHTER] DID YOSEMITE JONES
BURN THE KORAN LIKE HE PROMISE
STPH-FRPBLD WE FEEL LIKE GOD IS
TELLING US TO STOD.
>> Jon: REALLY?
WHEN GOD TOLD YOU TO DO IT
ORIGINALLY HE HADN'T ANTICIPATED
THE BACKLASH.
IS THAT IT?
HE NEVER SUE THAT COME SOMETHING
IN IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?
I THINK YOU ARE CONFUSING GOD
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD
TELLING TO YOU STOP.
WHEN GOD TOLD YOU NOT TO BURN
THE KORAN DID IT SOUND SOMETHING
LIKE THIS:  DON'T BE A (bleep)
IDIOT, DUDE?
THAT'S NOT GOD.
THAT'S EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY KORAN
BURNING TO FALL THROUGH, BY THE
WAY.
FOR MORE WE GO TO JENNIFER -- AT
OUR AMARILLO AFFILIATE --
>> A PUBLIC BURNING OF THE KORAN
DID NOT TAKE PLACE TODAY.
>> DAVID GRISHAM ATTEMPTED TO
PUBLICLY SET FIRE TO THE ISLAMIC
HOLY BOOK.
>> HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE
BURNING THE KORAN.
I WAS LIKE DUDE, YOU HAVE NO
KORAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: AND THE KORAN BURNER
AND WAS ALL BUMMER AND I WAS
ALL -- NEXT THING YOU KNOW I'M
IN THE BACK OF THE MYSTERY
MACHINE AND FRED IS JAMMING
SCOOBY SNACKS DOWN MY GULLET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE MEDIA WAS CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE
COVERING THESE ACTS.
PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS NEXT CLIP EXEMPLIFIES HOW
OFTEN THE MEDIA'S BETTER ANGELS
GET THE (bleep) KICKED OUT OF
THEM.
>> THIS GUY IS CLOWN OF EARTH
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING A
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT HE IS OR
ISN'T GOING TO DO.
WE CAN'T ADDRESS ALL THESE WHACK
JOBS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
THERE'S A SECOND SIDE OF THIS,
CHRIS, THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
>> I HAVE TOP INTERRUPT YOU
BECAUSE HERE IS THE PASTOR.
LET'S HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: AND THE WINNER AND
STILL UNDEFEATED DHAMPON IN THE
BATTLE BETWEEN THE MEDIA'S
SUPEREGO AND ID IS ID.
MORE MEDIA.
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.
THEY ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE MEDIA IS IN
THEY ARE THE DOG FROM THE MOVIE
UP.
>> HE IS A GOOD AND SMART MASTER
AND HE MADE ME THIS COLLAR SO
THAT I MAY TALK.
SQUIRREL!
>> Jon: YOU'RE RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE SHOULD NOT -- WE SHOULD NOT
BE FOLLOWING PASTOR JONES.
PASTOR JONES --
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE WHILE THE MEDIA
FOCUSED THEIR QUESTIONS ON
PASTOR JONES, FOX NEWS'S
SQUIRREL CONTINUED TO BE IMAM
RAWF -- RAUF AND HIS LOWER
MANHATTAN --
♪ ♪
>> I WANT TO KNOW THIS IMAM WILL
NOT CONDEMN THE TERRORIST GROUP
HAMAS.
>> WHO IS FINANCING THIS
EXPENSIVE MOSQUE SNCH THAT IMAM
RADICAL?
>> WHY IS IT SO CLOSE?
>> IS IT PROVOCATION,
CELEBRATION?
>> WITH SUCH A PLANET, WHY
THERE?
>> Jon: YES, WITH SUCH A BIG
GALAXY, WHY THIS PLANET?
WHY CAN'T THE MIHM YAWM MAKE IT
A -- IMAM MAKE THE A DBA LAIC --
GALACTIC COMMUNITY CENTER.
DEATH, DEATH -- I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GET SOME REVERB?
NO ALL RIGHT, ANSWER THE
QUESTION.
>> WILL YOU TURN DOWN MONEY FOR
PEOPLE WHO SAY GIVE NONHAMAS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT RIGHT
SAYING HAMAS IS A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION?
>> I CONDEMN ANYONE AND EVERYONE
WHO HAS COMMITTED ACTS OF
TERRORIST AND HAMAS HAS
COMMITTED ACTS OF INTEREST
TERRORISM.
>> Jon: NOT BAD.
ALL RIGHT.
HE ANSWERED SOME OF THE
QUESTIONS BUT THERE'S ONE
QUESTION YOU REFUSE TO ANSWER.
WHY ON THIS PLANET?
>> HAD I KNOWN THIS WOULD
HAPPEN, WE CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER
HAVE DONE THIS.
IF WE MOVE FROM THAT LOCATION,
THE STORY WILL BE THAT THE
RADICALS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE
DISCORSE H- -- THE HEADLINES IN
THE MUSLIM WORLD WILL BE THAT
ISLAM IS UNDER ATTACK.
THE CONCERN FOR AMERICAN
CITIZENS WHO LIVE AND WORK AND
TRAVEL OVERSEAS WILL BE
COMPROMISED IF THE RADICALS ARE
STRENGTHENED.
IF WE DON'T DO THIS RIGHT, ANGER
WILL EXPLODE IN THE MUSLIM
WORLD.
>> Jon: YOU THINK YOU ARE SO
REASONABLE WITH YOUR SMOKY VOICE
AND LICKABLE BEARD.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE SOME MAY THINK YOU ARE
PUTTING TOO MUCH CREDENCE IN OUR
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTROL THE
REACTION OF RADICALS.
OF COURSE, OTHERS MAY JUST HEAR
THIS.
>> IS THIS A THREAT?
>> HERE IS A THREAT HE MADE
YESTERDAY.
>> IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A
WARNING.
>> IS THAT A THREAT, LAURA?
>> IT'S A VAILED THREAT.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY
MISTAKE HE USED THE WORD EXPLODE
YONCH EEM YAM RAUF ANSWERED
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR
QUESTIONS BUT HERE IS WHAT THEY
HEARD AT FOX.
SQUIRREL!
[LAUGHTER]
EVEN AMERICA'S FORMER MAYOR RUDY
GIULIANI SAW GIRLS.
>> NOW WE HAVE THE IMAM WHO
TELLS US IF HE DOESN'T GET HIS
WAY THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT
AND DANGEROUS VIOLENCE.
THOSE ARE VERY, VERY STRONG
WORLD -- WORDS.
AND TO ENTER A SORT OF
SUGGESTION OF A THREAT INTO
THIS, I WORRY ABOUT THIS AS THE
KIND OF TACTICS HE PURSUES.
>> Jon: HE IS APPALLED.
TO USE A CHEAP USE OF FEAR AS A
WAY TO EXPEDITE YOUR DESIRED
OUTCOME, THAT IS SO A FEW YEARS
AGO.
>> ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT
EIGHT WEEKS FROM TODAY ON
NOVEMBER 2 WE MAKE THE RIGHT
CHOICE.
IF WE MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE THE
DANGER IS WE'LL GET HIT AGAIN.
>> BARACK AND HILLARY HAVE MADE
THEIR INTENTIONS CLEAR ON THE
WAR ON TERROR.
THEY WOULD RETREAT, DECLARE
DEFEAT AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF
THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING.
IT WOULD MEAN ATTACKS ON
AMERICA.
>> HOW DANGEROUS WOULD IT BE IF
A DEMOCRAT GETS ELECTION.
THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS
SHOW THEM WEAKNESS.
I BELIEVE THAT PUTS US IN
GREATER DANGER.
>> Jon: SEE THAT'S NOT A
THREAT.
THAT'S NOT A THREAT IF YOU DON'T
VOTE REPUBLICAN, WE'LL BE
ATTACKED BY TERRORISTS.
THOSE ARE HELPFUL WARNINGS THAT
HAVE PROTECTED OUR COUNTRY.
SOMETIMES I GET SO SAD WATCHING
THESE CLIPS
