>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS AREPORTER FOR THE "LOS ANGELES
TIMES."
HER BOOK IS CALLED "GHETTOCIDE"A TRUE STORY OF MURDER IN
AMERICA."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMJILL LEOVY.
JILL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
HOW ARE YOU?
>> FINE.
>> Jon:  THANK YOU FORBRAVING THE ELEMENTS COME IN
FROM SUNNY LOS ANGELES.
"GHETTOCIDE" A TRUE STORY OFMURDER IN AMERICA."
THIS IS INCREDIBLY GRIPPING,SORT OF TRUE CRIME STORY.
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO WRITEABOUT-- ABOUT THIS CASE, THIS
MURDER?
>> WELL, HOMICIDE IS NOT EVENLYDISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT AMERICAN
SOCIETY, RIGHT.
IN FACT, IT'S VERY, VERYCONCENTRATED.
IT PILES UP AMONG SMALL GROUPSOF PEOPLE IN LITTLE ENCLAVES,
CHIEFLY AMONG BLACK MEN INAMERICA.
>> Jon:  IN CITIES.
>> IN CITIES, AND ACTUALLYTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
THEY ARE THE GROUP WHO DIESMOST.
THEY ARE NUMBER ONE CRIMEVICTIMS.
THEY ARE 6% OF THE POPULATION,SOMETHING LIKE 40% OF MURDER
VICTIMS.
AND THIS GOES BACK AND BACK ANDBACK.
IT-- IT TRANSLATES TO THOUSANDSOF DEATHS A YEAR, DESTROYED
FAMILIES.
WE HAVE THIS MIRACULOUS CRIMEDROP.
THAT DISPROPORTION IS STILL WITHUS.
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT OURNEWSPAPER ARTICLE IN THE "LOS
ANGELES TIMES" THIS MORNING.
LOS ANGELES HAS MIRACULOUSLY LOWCRIME RATES.
260 MURDERS A YEAR, 112 OF THOSEWERE BLACK PEOPLE IN A CITY
THAT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN 8%BLACK, MAYBE 9.
>> Jon:  SO WHAT IS-- THISCASE, YOU HAVE A DETECTIVE HERE,
THIS SKAGGS FELLA.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, SO IN THE BOOKI TELL THE STORY OF ONE
DETECTIVE WHO WORKS IN WATTS,KIND OF A BACKWATER STATION
HOUSE IN A MIDDLING JOB.
HE'S A SURFER.
HE'S AN EXTREME PERFECTIONIST.
HE'S A VERY HYPERACTIVE PERSON.
I WAS EMBEDDED AND I WOULDSHADOW THESE DETECTIVES AND HE
WOULD LOOK AT ME ASKANCE IF ICAME IN AT 7:00 A.M. BECAUSE --
>> BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE ASLACKER.
>> A SLACKER.
HE GOT UP AT 3:00.
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN LUNCHBREAKS.
AND HE BROUGHT THIS KIND OFARTISAN'S SENSE I BELIEVE TO THE
GHETTOSIDE, IF YOU WILL, BLACKON BLACK, THAT WEREN'T GET,
PUBLIC ATTENTION OR MUCHATTENTION.
>> Jon:  AND HE'SRELENTLESS.
>> AND HE'S RELENTLESS.
THE BOOK CHRONICLES OF CASE OFHIS CAREER AND IT'S THE CASE OF
HIS CAREER NOT BECAUSE IT'S ABIG MEDIA CASE OR A CELEBRITY
CASE BUT THE YOUNG BLACK MAN WHOWAS MURDERED IS THE SON OF A
COLLEAGUE, A HIGHLY RESPECTEDHOMICIDE DETECTIVE.
AND SO THE CASE IS AT FIRSTUNSOLVED.
IT KIND OF LANGUISHES.
THEY BRING SKAGGS IN, AND THEBOOK GOES IN WITH HIM AND
WATCHES HIM KIND OF MOMENT BYMOMENT AS HE INVESTIGATES THIS
CASE.
AND THE IDEA IS TO THROUGH HIMAND THROUGH THIS CASE TELL THIS
WIDER STORY.
>> Jon:  SO THAT'S WHAT'S SOINTERESTING TO ME.
YOU GET TO THIS POINT, IT'SALMOST AN ANOMALY HOW MUCH
EFFORT IS PUT INTO SOLVING THISCASE.
IS PART OF THE ISSUE, THEN,ABOUT THESE CRIMES IN THESE
COMMUNITIES NOT THAT PEOPLEAREN'T WORKING HARD TO TRY TO
SOLVE THEM, BUT THEY'RE NOTGETTING THE ATTENTION AND THAT--
>> THE ATTENTION -->> COULD THAT DO SOMETHING--
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKINGABOUT THIS A LOT WITH THE
QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN GETTING ONTHE BOOK ABOUT WHO THE POLICE
ARE.
THE POLICE ARE AN EXTENSIONOFs YOU.
THEY ARE-- WHAT THEY DO REFLECTSOUR POLITICAL PRIORITIES.
AND I THINK WE SOMETIMES FORGETTHAT.
AND SO IF EVERYTHING WE LOOK ATIN POLICE DEPARTMENTS IS-- A
VITAL FUNCTION, IF YOU ASK ME--SOLVING KILLINGS, CATCHING
MURDERERS, AND SECONDARILY,ASSAILANTS WHO DON'T QUITE KILL
THEIR VICTIMS BUT ATTACK THEM,THEN THE FUNCTION IS GOING TO
LANGUISH.
THEY DEALT WITH A LOT OFIMPEDIMENTS.
THEY USED TO TAKE MY NOTEBOOKS-- NOT INTENTIONALLY.
THEY SAW THEM LYING AROUND.
BUT THEY WERE THAT SHORT OFOFFICE SUPPLIES THAT WHEN THE
EMBEDDED REPORTER CAME IN ANDPUT-- I WAS PARTICULAR OF MY
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOKS -- PUT THEMON THE DESK AND TURNED MY BACK--
>> Jon:  THE COPS WOULD TAKEYOUR NOTEBOOKS.
>> THEY NEEDED PAPER ANDPENCILES, THEY NEEDED THEM.
>> Jon:  AND YOU PROBABLYTHOUGHT TO YOURSELF, YOU KNOW
WHO I SHOULD CALL?
NOBODY THERE TO DO THAT.
>> IT'S JUST A SMALL EXAMPLE OFWHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon:  NO, THEY'RE UPAGAINST THESE TREMENDOUS
IMPEDIMENTS.
THE DICHOTOMY, IT SEEMS, IN THEHIGHER CRIME AREAS WHERE THE
FOCUS OF THE NARKTSZ PUBLICITYIS NOT ON THESE TERRIBLE
TRAGEDIES, YOU HAVE COMMUNITIESTHAT NEED MORE POLICING BUT THE
RIGHT TYPE OF POLICING, BECAUSETHEN THERE'S ALSO THAT TENSION
BETWEEN WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDEREDOVER-POLICING OR POLICE
BRUTALITY, OR-- SO NOW YOU HAVETHIS BALANCE THAT HAS TO PLAY
OUT.
>> IT CAN SEEM LIKE A PARADOX.
BUT I THINK ABOUT QUALITY VERSUSQUANTITY, AND THE WAY I DIVIDE
IT UP IN MY BOOK SITALK ABOUTTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
VENTIVE POLICING AND, YOU KNOW--AN L.A.P.D. COMMANDER SAID THIS
TO ME-- WHY SHOULD WE WORRYABOUT DETECTIVE WORK IT'S
REACTIVE.
WE DON'T REALLY LIKE THE WORD"REACTIVE.
>> Jon:  THE BROKEN WITHINIS PROACTIVE.
>> I DON'T BUY IT.
INSTEAD OF REACTIVE, LET'S USE."LET'S RESPOND TO THE ACTS THAT
HUMAN BEINGS COMMIT AS OPPOSEDTO IMAGINING WHAT THEY MIGHT DO
BEFORE THEY'VE DONE IT.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> IF THIS -->> UNLESS YOU'RE A FREE COG IN A
MINORITY REPORT AND THEN YOU LIEIN A POOL OF A LIQUID BISCUIT
AND COME UP WITH STUFF.
>> WE DON'T WANT ROBOTS TO DOLAW ENFORCEMENT.
WE DON'T WANT A DATA PROCESSORTO DO LAW ENFORCEMENT.
>> Jon:  I TOTALLY WANT AROBOT TO DO LAW ENFORCEMENT.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE KIND OFCOOL.
>> I THINK WE WANT HUMAN COPS.
>> Jon:  YES.
>> HUMAN WITNESSES.
>> Jon:  YES.
>> HUMAN JURIES.
THIS IS A HUMAN ENTERPRISE.
IT IS OUR CONVERSATION.
IT IS OUR CONSTITUTIONALDEMOCRACY.
AND IT SHOULD ALL START ON WHATPEOPLE DO.
>> Jon:  IT'S A FASCINATINGSTORY.
AND WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT ITIS THE STORY IS INCREDIBLY
SPECIFIC, BUT BY ITSSPECIFICITY, SPEAKS TO THIS MUCH
LARGER ISSUE.
SO IT'S A REALLY, REALLYGRIPPING AND WELL DONE.
"GHETTOSIDE."
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
JILL LEOVY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
