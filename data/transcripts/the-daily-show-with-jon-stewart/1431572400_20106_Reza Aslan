SELLING AUTHOR, HISBOOKS INCLUDES "NO GOD BUT GOD"

( APPLAUSE ).
>> HOW'S IT GOING?
>> Jon:  IT IS GOING VERYWELL.
>> ALL RIGHT!
>> Jon: BOY, YOUR PHONE MUST BERINGING OFF THE HOOK.
AS A MAN WHO STUDY-->> THE GOD BUSINESS IS VERY
GOOD.
>> Jon:  VERY GOOD RIGHTNOW.
>> YEAH, IT'S BEEN VERY GOOD TOME.
>> Jon: BECAUSE OF HOW BAD ITIS.
>> YEAH. THERE'S ALWAYSSOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
>> Jon:  WHY-- YOU KNOW,I'VE ALWAYS SAID RELIGION HAS
GIVEN PEOPLE GREAT COMFORT IN AWORLD TORN APART BY RELIGION.
( LAUGHTER )WHY HASN'T GOD JUST SETTLED
THIS?
>> YEAH, HE REALLY SHOULD,JUST WHO'S RIGHT.
JUST GET IT OVER WITH. YEAH.
>> Jon:  WHY?
BECAUSE DOESN'T HE EVER THINK,OKAY, OKAY, THIS HAS GONE ON
LONG ENOUGH?
>> WELL, LOOK, THE THING ABOUTRELIGION THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT'S FAR MOREA MATTER OF IDENTITY THAN IT IS
JUST A MATTER OF BELIEFS ANDPRACTICES.
I MEAN, THOSE THINGS AREIMPORTANT.
BUT WHEN YOU SAY, "I'M A JEW,I'M A MUSLIM, I'M A CHRISTIAN,"
YOU'RE MAKING AN IDENTITYSTATEMENT FAR MORE SO THAN A
STATEMENT OF THETHINGS YOU BELIEVE.
I MEAN, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY--SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS CALL
THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS, SEVEN OUTOF 10 AMERICANS.
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE.
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS.
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS.
>> Jon:  HOLD ON.
I DON'T DO WELL WITH THIS.>> YEAH IT'S NOT, YEAH --
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING 135%.>> YEAH, I'M SAYING --
>> Jon: WAIT, HOLD ON.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> THAT MEANS THAT-- THAT MEANSTHAT-- YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR
KIDS TO HELP.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT MEANS THAT SEVEN OUT OF10 AMERICAN GOES TO CHURCH ON
SUNDAY OR SEVEN OUT OF 10AMERICANS READ THE BIBLE ON A
REGULAR BASIS --
>> Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU'RESAYING.
>> OR SEVEN OUT OF 10AMERICANS CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT JESUS -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> EXCEPT THAT HE WAS BORN IN AMAINCHER AND DIED ON A CROSS?
NO, OF COURSE, NOT.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT 70%WHEN SAY THEY I'M A CHRISTIAN
THEY'RE MAKING A STATEMENT OFTHEIR IDENTITY THAT INCLUDES
THEIR NATIONALITY, THEIRETHNICITY, THEIR WORLD VIEW --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEIR POLITICS. ALL OF THOSETHINGS ARE WRAPPED UP.
SO RELIGION IS ABOUT WHO YOU AREAS A PERSON AS MUCH AS IT IS
ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE AND THERITUALS THAT YOU PRACTICE.
>> Jon: WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUTWHEN YOU SAID THAT, YOU SAID
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANSIDENTIFY AS CHRISTIANS,
IS THE WHOLE MERRY CHRISTMASHULLABALOO.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU SAY THAT IN ASTORE, YOU HAVE A 30% CHANCE OF
BEING WRONG.
>> OF OFFENDING SOMEBODY? YEAH.
>> Jon: AND IT REALLY DOES, ITWOULD BE ALMOST LIKE SAYING,
"FROM NOW ON IN STORESJUST SAY,' HELLO, SIR'."
>> YEAH, YEAH. WELL, AS AMUSLIM, WHENEVER SOMEBODY
SAYS MERRY CHRISTMAS, I'MOBLIGATED TO SAY ( BLEEP ) YOU.
>> Jon:  WHAT? IS THAT TRUE?>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IS THAT IN THE KORAN?
>> IT'S IN THE KORAN. IT'S INTHE KORAN. YEAH.
>> Jon: I HAD NO IDEA.
I THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF THEHADITH.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS IN THEKORAN.
BUT IT BRINGS UP SUCH ANINTERESTING POINT BECAUSE I
TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU REMOVETHE CONSTRUCT OF RELIGION--
AND THAT'S WHY THIS DISCUSSIONOF ISLAM IS SO IMPORTANT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BECAUSE NOW THE THREADIS THAT ISLAM OF ALL THE
MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS -->> RIGHT.
>> Jon: IS PARTICULARLY PRONETO EXTREMISM, MAYBE IN THIS
MOMENT, CERTAINLY THE OTHERRELIGIONS HAVE HAD IT.
>> YEAH. YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT RELIGION IS MORETHAN ANYTHING ELSE, A CHOICE BUT
NOT VIEWED THAT WAY.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I THINK
IT'S-- LOOK, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY ASERIOUS PROBLEM WITH RELIGION--
RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN THE WORLD,AND PARTICULARLY IN ISLAM AND
THE MIDDLE EAST.
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLAMERELIGION FOR VIOLENCE IN THE
NAME OF RELIGION, THEN YOU HAVETO CREDIT RELIGION FOR EVERY ACT
OF COMPASSION IN THE NAME OFRELIGION.
YOU HAVE TO CREDIT RELIGION FOREVERY ACT OF LOVE IN THE NAME OF
RELIGION.
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLEUSUALLY THINK.
I MEAN, THEY FOCUS VERY MUCH ONTHE NEGATIVES.
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THATTHERE'S THIS MISCONCEPTION THAT
PEOPLE DERIVE THEIR VALUES FROMTHEIR SCRIPTURES.
AND THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S MOREOFTEN THE CASE THAT PEOPLE
INSERT THEIR VALUES INTO THEIRSCRIPTURES.
I MEAN, OTHERWISE, EVERYCHRISTIAN WHO READ THIS
BIBLE WOULD READ IT EXACTLYTHE SAME WAY.
IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT 200 YEARSAGO, BOTH SLAVE OWNERS AND
ABOLITIONISTS NOT ONLY USED THESAME BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THEIR
VIEWPOINTS.
THEY USED THE SAME VERSES TO DOSO.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE THING ABOUTSCRIPTURE.
ITS POWER COMES FROM ITSMALLEABILITY.
YOU CAN READ IT IN ANY WAY YOUWANT TO.
IF YOU ARE A VIOLENT MISOGYNIST,YOU WILL FIND PLENTY IN THE
KORAN OR THE BIBLE TOJUSTIFY YOUR VIEWPOINT.
IF YOU'RE A PEACEFUL FEMINIST,YOU WILL FIND JUST AS MUCH IN
THOSE SCRIPTURES TO JUSTIFY YOURVIEWPOINT.
>> Jon:  WHAT IF YOU'RE AJEW WHO LOVES A BACON EGG
CROISSAN'WICH?
IS THERE-- IS THERE SOMETHINGFOR ME?
>> THAT MIGHT BE -->> Jon: JUST AS A --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING.
>> I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOK OFMORMON FOR YOU. THAT MIGHT --
>> Jon: YES! I KNEW IT!>> BUT I MEAN --
>> Jon: BUT THAT IS THE POINT.
>> EXACTLY.
THE POINT IS IS THAT WITHOUTINTERPRETATION SCRIPTURE IS JUST
WORDS ON A PAGE.
IT REQUIRES SOMEBODY TO READ IT,TO ENCOUNTER IT FOR IT TO HAVE
ANY KIND OF MEANING, ANDOBVIOUSLY IN THAT TRANSACTION,
YOU ARE BRINGING YOURSELF, YOURVIEWS, YOUR POLITICS, YOUR
SOCIAL IDEAS INTO THE TEXT.
HOW YOU READ SCRIPTURE HASEVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHO YOU
ARE.
GOD DOES NOT MAKE YOU A BIGOT.
YOU'RE JUST A BIGOT.
>> Jon:  THE VIOLENCE -- THAT'SA GOOD POINT.
AND THE VIOLENCE IN THATREGION IS AN OUTGROWTH OF
PAUCITY OF MANY THINGS, RELIGIONNOT BEING THE SOLE DRIVER OF
THESE IDENTITY DIFFICULTIES THATARE GOING ON.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THATARE INVOLVED-- SOCIAL ISSUES,
POLITICAL ISSUES, CULTURALISSUES.
ALL THOSE THINGS.
>> Jon:  WILL YOU STICKAROUND AROUND.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLBE BITABOUT --
>> HOW TO FIX THE MIDDLE EAST?
>> Jon: IT'D BE NICE.
>> LET'S DO THIS.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. AND, BY THEWAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT ON
AIR CAUSE THAT'D BE TOO EASY.
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ON THE WEB.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THE PAPERBACK OF"ZEALOT" IS ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW.
REZA ASLAN.
