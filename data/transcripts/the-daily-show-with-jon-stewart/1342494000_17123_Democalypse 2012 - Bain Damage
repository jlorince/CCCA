( THEME SONG PLAYING )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO
THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'RE BACK, BABY, TWO WEEKS.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT LOUIS C.K. WILL BE JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOUIS, CK OF COURSE--  (LAUGHTER) LOUIS CALVIN KLEIN.
(LAUGHTER) CHANGED HAD FOR SHOW BUSINESS.
LOOK, I CAN'T GIVE YOU A RECAP OF ALL THE [BLEEP]
THAT HAPPENED, OVER THE PAST,
EVERY MAJOR STORY.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU-- IN WHAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED A BIT OF DEVEIN INTERVENTION, THE HOT
POLITICAL MOMENT OF MITT ROMNEY VENTURE CAPITAL WHICH HAPPENED TO BEAR THE SAME
FAME AS THE POST FRIGHTENING AND CURRENT BATMAN VILLAIN.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2012 THANK YOU JESUS EDITION.
(LAUGHTER) BAIN!
NOT SINCE AID-- DIET CANDY SUFFERED THROUGH THEIR SOMEWHAT ILL TIMED 19880
LOSE WEIGHT WITH AIDS SALES CAMPAIGN HAS A BRAND FACED SUCH CHALLENGES.
BAIN!
>> CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
MY FRIEND.
(LAUGHTER) NOW ROMNEY'S BAIN SEEN HERE WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN AD FOR AN ODDLY LUKE CAT
CAT-- LUCRATIVE ALL CLOTHED MALE STRIP REVIEW, THEY CALLED HIM MAGIC MIKE, SEE
MITT ROMNEY TOLD HIM IT IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT HE HAS RUN A BUSINESS SO HE
KNOWS HOW TO CREATE JOBS.
ONE PROBLEM.
WHEN MITT ROMNEY WAS C.E.O.
OF BAIN CAPITAL IN THE '90s,
BAIN INVESTED IN A SERIES OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING CALL CENTERS AN MANUFACTURERS
THAT EXPANDED OVERSEAS,
SOMETIMES AT THE EXPENSE OF AMERICAN WORKERS.
>> Jon: HE NEVER SAID HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS GOING CREATE THOSE JOBS.
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR MITT ROMNEY.
LUCKILY, HE'S GOT A BIT OF --
>> ROMNEY SAYS HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM BAIN CAPITAL IN FEBRUARY OF 1999
TO RUN THE SALT LAKE OLYMPICS WHICH MEANS HE NEVER HAD CONTROL OF THE COMPANY'S DOING THE OUTSOURCING.
>> AH.
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OUTSOURCING BECAUSE AT THE TIME HE WAS TOO BUSY
BRINGING FOREIGNERS TO AMERICA TO TAKE OUR GOLD.
(LAUGHTER) ONE SMALL PROBLEM WITH ROMNEY'S EXPLANATION.
BETWEEN 1999 AND 2002 BAIN SEC FILING STATED ROMNEY WAS THE CHEF EXIVE OFFICER,
PRESIDENT MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PAID AT LEAST $100,000 A YEAR.
MITT.
>> THE DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OWNERSHIP WHICH IS THAT I
OWN SHARES AT BAIN BUT I DID TO THE MANAGE BAIN, WHEN YOU LEAVE AN ENTERPRISE AND YOU
HAVE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE MANAGING THE ENTERPRISE, WHO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL
THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS,
WHO DECIDE WHOSE'S GOING TO GET HIRED AND FIRED, WHO DECIDE COMPENSATION
DECISIONS, THEY'RE THE MANAGERS.
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE BUSINESS.
>> Jon: I WAS JUST-- WITH THE SMOKE SCREENISH YET STILL LEGAL TITLE OF C.E.O.
AND MANAGING DIRECTOR WHO WAS PAID AT LEAST $100,000 A YEAR TO DO WHAT ACCORDING TO
ME, MITT ROMNEY, WAS NOTHING.
THAT'S THE KIND OF CAP AND SPEND BUSINESS EXPERIENCE I HOPE TO BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHAT!
WHAT!
WHAT.
CAN A BROTHER GET A SURROGATE UP IN THIS BITCH.
>> HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND HE ENDED UP TO THE GOING BACK AT ALL.
AND RETIRED RETROACTIVELY TO FEBRUARY OF 1999 AS A RESULT.
>> Jon: RETIRED RETROACTIVELY.
SEE N 2012 I REALIZED THE COMPANY I WAS LEGALLY C.E.O.
OF IN 1999 DID THINK IT WAS HURT MY PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN THE PRESENT SO I
RETROACTIVELY WASN'T THERE.
(LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SAYING THAT IF YOU HAVE A TIME MACHINE YOU NECESSARILY HAVE TO KILL HITLER.
BUT THIS RETROACTIVE RETIREMENT IS THE WORST USE OF A TIME
