(LAUGHTER) FOR MORE...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR MORE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S INDUSTRIOUS
INDIVIDUALISM WE GO TO AASIF MANDVI AT THE CONVENTION CENTER.
AASIF, WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR,
JON!
>> Jon: WHY IS IT RAINING?
>> OH, NO, THIS ISN'T RAIN.
THE DELUGE I'M STANDING IN IS SWEAT POURING OFF THE BODIES OF THE EXTREMELY INSPIRED,
HARDWORKING "NO HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT" SELF-RELIANT REALLY
SWEATY GROUP OF REAL AMERICANS!
>> Jon: SO THERE'S... THEY SERE BUSY BUILDING STUFF, THAT'S
WHERE THE SWEAT IS COMING FROM?
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?
>> I WAS A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS OF ANDERSON COOPER AND OTHER REPORTERS BATTING THE ELEMENTS.
I JUST WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, SHOW THEM THAT I COULD HACK IT.
I COULD BE CNN'S SANJAY GUPTA OF STORMS.
YOU KNOW, STORM-JAY GUPTA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: YOU SET UP A RAIN MACHINE INSIDE THE COB SREPBGS CENTER.
>> IT'S MOSTLY SPIT AND BEER.
SEE, THESE PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE "THE DAILY SHOW."
OR "THE LAST AIR BENDER." IT WAS M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN, IT WAS A GOOD SCRIPT!
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
AASIF MANDVI.
I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT THE WHOLE "WE BUILT IT" CHANT THING...
IT'S A LITTLE CALL AND RESPONSEY.
MAYBE IT'S THE CRUSHING HUMIDITY OR THE REALLY RICK DID HROUBG HUMIDITY BUT...
(LAUGHTER).
I'M KIND OF GETTING INTO IT.
LET ME ADDRESS THE CONVENTION.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN ADDRESS THE PEOPLE THERE AND SEE IF I CAN GET INTO THIS THEME.
ALL RIGHT, READY?
A CONVENTION THEME AT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN CYNICALLY BASED AROUND SOMETHING THE
PRESIDENT NEVER ACTUALLY SAID.
>> WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
>> YES, YOU DID BUILD THAT.
NO ONE CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE.
A PARTY-WIDE PERSECUTION COMPLEX WHERE ANY REFERENCE TO THE COLLECTIVE GOOD IS SOMEHOW TAKEN
AS A DENIGRATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S ACHIEVEMENT.
>> WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
>> Jon: YOU DID BUILD THAT,
TOO!
YOU'RE VERY BUSY.
ALL RIGHT LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE.
A MORAL CODE THAT EQUATES PARENTAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH MOXIE AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
WHILE EQUATING GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH LACK OF CHARACTER AND WAY OF LIFE
DESTROYING DEPENDENCY.
>> WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
>> Jon: YES, YOU DID!
YES, YOU DID!
OH, WAIT, I GOT ONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOLD ON, I GOT ONE!
I GOT ONE.
THE CONVENTION CENTER YOU'RE SITTING IN.
>> WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
>> Jon: THAT'S FACTUALLY INACCURATE.
(LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THAT WAS TAXPAYER MONEY AND UNION WORKERS.
LET ME TRY AGAIN.
AN ALTERNATE REALITY WHERE BARACK OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST MUSLIM, GLOBAL WARMING IS FROM
POLAR BEAR FARTS, FOX NEWS IS FAIR AND BALANCED AND THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR WAY OF
LIFE IN A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ADVANTAGE FOR THE
WEALTHY IS TWO DUDES WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED.
>> WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: YOU MUST
