GREATEST FEAT KNOWN TO MODERNFAKE NEWSCASTING.

YOUNG BLACK MAN IN THE AREA OFST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
MICHAEL SAM, YESTERDAY HE TOOKONE STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING THE
FIRST OPENLY GAY MAN TO PLAY AREGULAR SEASON NFL GAME.
HE ADVANCED TO THE ST. LOUISRAMS 75-MAN ROSTER.
OF COURSE, ESPN HAS BEENCOVERING HIS PERFORMANCE EVERY
STEP OF THE WAY.
>> HOW IS HE FITTING IN WITH HISRAMS TEAMMATES SO FAR?
>> WELL JAY, DEFENSIVE TACKLEKENDALL LANGFORD SAID THAT
MICHAEL SAM IS JUST SIMPLYONE OF THE GUYS. BUT ANOTHER
RAMS DEFENSIVE PLAYER TOLD METHAT, "SAM IS RESPECTING OUR
SPACE AND THAT FROM HISPERSPECTIVE HE SEEMS TO THINK
THAT MICHAEL SAM IS WAITING TOKIND OF TAKE A SHOWER AS
NOT TO MAKE HIS TEAMMATES FEELUNCOMFORTABLE."
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WHY WOULD HIS
TEAMMATES FEEL UNCOMFORTABLESHOWERING WITH MICHAEL SAM?
DOES HE USE AXE GARLIC ANDROTTEN EGG BODY WASH?
DOES MICHAEL SAM HAVE A KUATO?
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DIDN'TREALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS EITHER.
[LAUGHTER]MICHAEL SAM'S GAY.
ARE WE NOT OVER THIS YET?
>> NOW WHILE LANGFORD TOLD ME,"LISTEN I HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE
SHOWER AT THE SAME TIME ASMICHAEL SAM, HE SAID THAT THERE
DEFINITELY COULD BE A MILLIONREASONS AS TO WHY THAT IS.
HE SAID HE COULD BE DOING EXTRAWORK ON THE PRACTICE FIELD.
HE COULD BE RIDING HIS BIKE, HECOULD BE DOING EXTRA CARDIO."
>> Jon: YES, THOSE ARE ALL THEMOST LIKELY THINGS A FOOTBALL
PLAYER MIGHT BE DOING, BUT HECOULDN'T HE ALSO BE SINGING SHOW
TUNES OR BINGE WATCHING BRAVO.
ESPN VIEWERS NEED TO KNOW.

PLAYERS IS GONNA BE ONSATURDAY.
>> YES.
>> Jon: HOW ARE MICHAEL SAM'SPROSPECTS TO MAKE THIS TEAM?
>> WELL JON...>> Jon: WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING?
>> JON, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT ITSOUNDS LIKE SAM IS IN TROUBLE.
>> Jon: NOW, YOU DON'T THINKHE'S GOING TO MAKE THE TEAM?
HAS HE BEEN PLAYING LESS WELLTHAN HAS BEEN REPORTED?
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
HIS WORK ON THE LINE HAS BEENGREAT, BUT HE'S BEEN MAKING HIS
TEAMMATES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
>> Jon: WELL, ACTUALLY THEYSAID HE'S BEEN RESPECTING THEM.
HE HASN'T BEEN SHOWERING WITHTHEM.
>> NO, NO, NO.
IN FACT, HE HASN'T BEEN GETTINGNAKED AROUND THEM AT ALL.
JON, THERE'S BEEN NO GRAB-ASS,NO DICK SNAPS, NO BALL CUPPING,
NONE OF THE LOCKER ROOM BEHAVIOROF NORMAL, HETEROSEXUAL NFL
PLAYERS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I KNOW THE LOCKER ROOM
CAN GET A LITTLE, YOU KNOW,WHATEVER THERE, THE GRAB-ASSY
CULTURE.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD, THOUGH.
>> OH, IT ISN'T, JON?
WELL, I HAPPEN TO HAVE A COPY OFTHE 2008 NFL EXPOSE, "BOYS WILL
BE BOYS."
DO YOU REMEMBER CHARLES HAYLEY?
>> Jon: NO, I DON'T, ALINEBACKER FOR THE 49ers,
TWO-TIME NFC DEFENSIVE PLAYER OFTHE YEAR, MORE THAN 100 CAREER
SACKS.
>> YEAH. HAYLEY WOULD STROLL UPTO AN UNSUSPECTING TEAMMATE,
WHIP OUT HIS PHALLUS ANDREPEATEDLY STROKE IT IN HIS
FACE. A PHALLUS IS A [BLEEPED],JON.
>> Jon: I'M FAMILIAR WITH THETERM.
>> HE WOULD WRAP HIS HAND AROUNDHIS PENIS, TURN TOWARD JOE
MONTANA AND BELLOW, "YOU KNOWYOU WANT TO SUCK THIS."
>> Jon: THAT IS OUTRAGEOUSBEHAVIOR.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Jon: JOE MONTANA LED THE49ers TO FOUR SUPER BOWL WINS.
CHARLES HAYLEY SHOULD BE SUCKINGHIS [BLEEPED].
>> OKAY.
OKAY.
OKAY, JON.
YOU KNOW WHAT, REASONABLE PEOPLECAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHICH TOTALLY
STRAIGHT PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERSHOULD BE BLOWING THE OTHER.
THE POINT IS: IF MICHAEL SAMWANTS TO FIT INTO THE NFL, HE
BETTER CUT THE SHY ACT AND GAYIT UP.
>> Jon: SO YOU THINK HE SHOULDBE SHOWERING WITH THE TEAM.
>> OH, MY GOD, YES, AND THENWHEN THEY'RE DRYING OFF,
SNEAKING UP BEHIND THEM ANDPUTTING HIS WET DICK IN THEIR
EAR, YOU KNOW, HETERO STYLE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THEREPORT, SAM
SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYBODY.
