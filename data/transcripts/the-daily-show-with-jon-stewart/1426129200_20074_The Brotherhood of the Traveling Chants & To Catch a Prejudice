( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF
COMMON, HE'S IN THE FILM"SELMA," LAST WEEKEND,
WE SAW THE COMMEMORATION OF THE50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH
IN SELMA.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY INSPIRINGREMINDER OF THE LENGTHS THAT
PEOPLE HAD TO GO TO DURING THECIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
FROM SELMA TO THE LUNCH COUNTERGREENSBORO SIT-INS,
TO THE INTERSTATE BUSFREEDOM RIDERS.
BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS ISAACNEWTON WHO ONCE SAID FOR EVERY
BUS BENDING THE ARC OF THE MORALUNIVERSE TOWARDS JUSTICE,
THERE'S ANOTHER BUS COMING INTHE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
( LAUGHTER )TRYING REALLY HARD TO BEND THAT
MOTHER ( BLEEP ) BACK.
( LAUGHTER )>> A BUS PACKED WITH S.A.E.
FRATERNITY MEMBERS.
YOU CAN HANG THEM FROM A TREEBUT THEY'LL NEVER SIGN WITH ME
THERE WILL NEVER BE A ( BLEEP )IN S.A.E.
>> Jon:  HA-HA-HA-BOOM!
THAT IS THE UNIVERSITY OF-- THATIS THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA'S
SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON FRATERNITYDESCRIBING THEIR RUSH POLICY IN
RACIST CHANT FORM.
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKINGAFTER SEEING THAT VIDEO--
NOW LUCKILY, OKLAHOMA LINEBACKER ERIC STRIKER PUT YOUR
FEELING INTO WORDS.
I'M SO ( BLEEP ) FURIOUS RIGHTNOW.
S.A.E. JUST ( BLEEP ) IT UP FORYOU ALL ( BLEEP ) WHITE
FRATERNITIES.

THEM HOW YOU REALLY LOVE US.
( BLEEP ) YOU PHONY ( BLEEP )FRAUD ( BLEEP ).
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  I FELT THAT.
( LAUGHTER )BY THE WAY, PHONY-ASS-BITCHES IS
THOSE KIDS' NEW FRATERNITY.
NOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOTTASAY, I THINK EVERYONE FELT
PRETTY ANGRY AFTER THISINCIDENT, BUT LUCKILY, WE GOT A
SPEEDY APOLOGY.
>> I WAS ANGERED.
I WAS-- YOU KNOW, I WASOUTRAGED. AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE PROFANITY, BUT I'M NOTAPOLOGIZING ABOUT HOW I
FELT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I FELTIN MY HEART.
>> Jon:  OH, I FORGOT TOMENTION THE FIRST ONE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THIS ENTIREINCIDENT WASN'T THE BUS FULL OF
RACIST CHANTERS, BUT THE GUY WHOMADE THE MISTAKE OF SWEARING
WHEN HE REACTED TO THE BUS FULLOF RACISTS.
( LAUGHTER )BUT DON'T WORRY, THOSE S.A.E.
KIDS DEEPLY REGRET THAT SOMEONEFILMED THIS.
>> PARKER RICE, THE FRESH-FACEDFRAT BOY LEADING MEMBERS OF
S.A.E. IN THAT NOW-INFAMOUSCHANT, IS APOLOGIZING PUBLICLY
WRITING, "I AM DEEPLY SORRY FORWHAT I DID SATURDAY NIGHT.
IT WAS WRONG AND RECKLESS.
I MADE A HORRIBLE MISTAKE."
HE GOES ON TO SAY ALCOHOL MAYHAVE FUELED HIS BAD DECISION
MAKING.
>> Jon:  OH, YEAH MAY HAVE.
( LAUGHTER )MAY HAVE.
ALTHOUGH, NOT AS MUCH AS THERACISM.
( LAUGHTER )UNLESS YOU WERE SIPPING ONE OF
THEM "JOHNNY WALKER NO BLACKS."
OR PERHAPS A "BUD-WHITE."
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOUCAN EXPECT WHEN YOU LET YOUNG,
CLUELESS WHITE GUYS RUN AROUNDWITHOUT ANY SUPERVISION.
>> ANOTHER VIDEO HAS SURFACED.
THIS ONE APPEARS TO SHOW THEFRATERNITY'S 78-YEAR-OLD HOUSE
MOTHER USING THAT SAME RACIALSLUR BACK IN 2013.
( BLEEP ), ( BLEEP ), ( BLEEP ),( BLEEP ).
>> THE FORMER HOUSE MOM, HERNAME BEAUTON GILBOW.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
TERRIBLE, BUT I WILL SAY IT IS ABIT OF A RELIEF WHEN YOU'RE
DOING A HORRIBLE STORY ANDEVERYTHING SEEMS SO DARK,
BUT FOR COMIC RELIEF, INWALKS FUTON ELBOW.
>> BEAUTON GILBOW.
>> Jon:  BON-BON PILLOW.
>> BEAUTON GILBOW.
>> TAUNTAUN ARMADILLO.
>> BEAUTON GILBOW.
>> Jon:  BEYONCE SASPARILLO.
>> BEAUTON GILBOW.
>> Jon:  BOCA RATON DILDO. I--
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
I DON'T-- I'M SORRY, I DON'T--YOU KNOW, THERE WAS OUTRAGE.
>> THEY'RE DISGUSTING.
THEY'RE HORRIBLE.
>> DISGUSTING AND RACIST.
>> AWFUL.
>> VIOLENT, VULGAR.
>> SICKENING.
>> Jon:  YES, IT'S AWFUL ANDTHE FRATERNITY CHAPTER WAS
IMMEDIATELY AND RIGHTFULLYDISBANDED.
TWO PEOPLE EXPELLED FOR THEDISGRACEFUL DISPLAY.
I MEAN, THERE'S NO EXCUSE FORIT, OR SO YOU WOULD THINK.
>> THE KIDS THAT ARE BUYINGHIP-HOP, IT'S A WHITE AUDIENCE,
AND THEY HEAR THIS OVER AND OVERAGAIN.
>> POPULAR CULTURE BECOMES ACESSPOOL.
A THE LOVE CORPORATIONS PROFITOVER IT-- OFF IT-- AND THEN
PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED THAT SOMEDRUNK 19-YEAR-OLD KIDS REPEAT
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARING.
>> EXACTLY!
>> Jon:  TWO THINGS,FIRST OF ALL, THE KIDS ON THAT
BUS WEREN'T REPEATING A RAP SONGTHAT THEY HAD HEARD.
THEY WERE GLEEFULLY PERFORMINGONE OF THEIR FRATERNITY'S, OLD
LET'S CALL THEM ANTI-NEGROSPIRITUALS, FEATURING A WORD
THAT PREDATES RAP AND PROBABLYFOLK AND THOUGHT.
BLACK RAPPERS DID NOT INTRODUCETHAT WORD INTO THE VERNACULAR.
AND SECOND OF ALL, HOW COME WHENCONSERVATIVES TALK ABOUT AFRICAN
AMERICANS THEY SAY THESE PEOPLENEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THEMSELVES, PULL UP THOSEPANTS AND GET A JOB.
BUT WHEN WHITE PEOPLE DOSOMETHING RACIST THEY'RE ALL,
WHAT YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM,HOW COULD THOSE POOR CHILDREN
DON'T KNOW WRONG FROM WHITEAFTER BEING DRIVEN TO
MADNESS BY THE IRRESISTIBLEPOWER OF THE HIPPITY-HOPPITY.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD ASTRING OF REALLY PUBLIC RACIST
INCIDENTS OH, THESE PAST YEARS.
>> CLIVEN BUNDY SUGGESTING THATBLACKS MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER
OFF UNDER SLAVERY.
>> DONALD STERLING IS ACCUSED OFMAKING RACIST REMARKS THAT WERE
CAUGHT ON TAPE.
>> A BLISTERING JUSTICEDEPARTMENT REPORT FOUND A
PATTERN OF RACIAL BIAS INFERGUSON POLICING.
>> Jon: AND EACH TIME ONE OFTHESE COMES TO LIGHT CERTAIN
PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA PRESENT ITNOT AS BEING INDICATIVE OF A
DEEP, PROBLEMATIC RACIAL DIVIDEIN OUR NATION THAT EXISTS TILL
TODAY, BUT AS AN UNENDINGSERIES OF ISOLATED EVENTS.
>> IT'SSTERLING'S PROBLEM.
IT'S BUNDY'S PROBLEM.
IT'S NOT THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEM.
>> WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.
WE HAVE LEADERS OF ALL MAJORINDUSTRIES WHO ARE BLACK.
>> IT'S A GENERATIONAL THING.
>> RACISM IS ON ITS LAST LEG.
>> Jon: IT'S A PRETTY STRONG( BLEEP ) LEG.
( LAUGHTER )I THINK IT MIGHT BE-- I THINK IT
MIGHT BE A BIONIC LEG. ( LAUGHTER )
SO RATHER THAN FACE THELINGERING
REALITY OF PREJUDICE IN THISCOUNTRY, EACH INCIDENT, EVEN THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S FERGUSONREPORT, AS COMPREHENSIVE A
CATALOG OF RACE-BASED PREDATIONSAS ANYONE IS GOING TO FIND,
IT'S AN INVITATION TO BEND OVERBACKWARDS TO NEGATE THE ROLE OF
RACE.
>> BASICALLY WHAT THEY SAY ISTHE FERGUSON POLICE-- FERGUSON
MUNICIPALITY, THE CITY OFFERGUSON, IS SO DESPERATE FOR
MONEY THAT IT IS ISSUING TONS OFTRAFFIC CITATIONS, MINOR FINES
THAT ARE ABUSIVE.
SO IT'S NOT A STORY OFINSTITUTIONAL RACISM IN
FERGUSON.
IT'S A STORY OF BLOOD-SUCKINGLOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S TRYING
TO GET EVERY OUNCE OFREVENUE THAT IT CAN.
>> Jon:  BY OVERWHELMINGLYHARASSING BLACK PEOPLE.
NO ACCUMULATION OF RACISTINCIDENTS IS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE
THESE GUYS THAT RACISM IS STILLA SOCIETY-WIDE PROBLEM
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THECONSERVATIVE MEDIA'S WHOLE
BUSINESS MODEL IS GENERALIZINGISOLATED INCIDENTS.
USING ONE LOBSTER-EATING SURFERON FOOD STAMPS
OR ONE RENAMED HOLIDAY PARADETO CONVINCE THEIR
FEARFUL VIEWERS THIS COUNTRY ISIN THE THROES OF A FREELOADERS
CHRISTMAS WAR.
WELL, I GUESS IN FOX-WORLDPOVERTY IS A CHOICE BUT BEING
RACIST IS A PRODUCT OFYOUR ENVIRONMENT.
( LAUGHTER )BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVEN WITH THAT IN MIND, I'MHOPEFUL.
BECAUSE RACISM DENIERS ARE JUSTA SLIGHT INFLECTION AWAY FROM
ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING THEDEPTH OF THE REAL PROBLEM.
HERE'S MEGYN KELLY EXPLAININGWHY FINDING E-MAILS FROM
FERGUSON POLICE SUPERVISORSCOMPARING THE PRESIDENT TO A
CHIMPANZEE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ALARGER ISSUE.
>> THERE ARE VERY FEW COMPANIESIN AMERICA, WHETHER THEY'RE
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, IN WHICHIF YOU SIC 40 F.B.I. AGENTS
ON THE COMPANY AND REVIEW EVERYEMIL AND EVERY DOCUMENT AND
EVERY COMMUNICATION YOU CANBETWEEN THE EMPLOYEES,
YOU WON'T FIND ANY RACISTE-MAILS, ANY INAPPROPRIATE
COMMENTS AND THEN TOTAR THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION WITH
THAT IS ADDITIONALLYPROBLEMATIC.
>> Jon:  IT'S SO CLOSE!
( LAUGHTER )YOU HAVE THE RIGHT WORDS.
YOUR INFLECTION IS JUST A LITTLEOFF.
LET ME TRY IT AGAIN.
( CLEARS THROAT )THERE ARE VERY FEW COMPANIES IN
AMERICA WHERE IF YOU REVIEWTHEIR COMMUNICATIONS YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO FIND RACIST E-MAILS!
YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
DO YOU SEE HOW THAT?
AND THEN JUST AS A SUGGESTIONYOU COULD TAG THAT SENTENCE
WITH, "HOW ( BLEEP ) UP ISTHAT!"
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
