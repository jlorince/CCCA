>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
WHAT IS IN A NAME?
THAT BY WE WE CALL A ROSE BY ANYOTHER NAME WOULD STILL...
YOU KNOW?
GROW AND...
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMESTO MOUNTAINS, IT'S TRICKIER, AS
JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
>> P.C. CULTURE IS OUT OFCONTROL.
FIRST, THEY CAME FOR OUR TEAMNAMES AND I SAID NOTHING BECAUSE
I WASN'T A PROFESSIONAL SPORTSFRANCHISE, BUT NOW THEY'RE
COMING FOR OUR MOUNTAINS.
MT. McKINLEY NAMED AFTER OURBELOVED 25th PRESIDENT IS
UNDER ATTACK BY THE INDIGENOUSPEOPLE OF ALASKA.
>> THEY CALL IT MT. McKINLEYBUT HIS NAME SHOULDN'T BE
APPLIED TO THIS MOUNTAIN.
WE WANT IT TO BE DENALI.
>> ALL OVER ALASKA, PEOPLE ARELI KE EVON PETER, AN
ATHABASKAN CHEIF, ARE ADVOCATINGTO NAME THIS MOUNTAIN AFTER A
POPULAR SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE.
>> THIS IS OUR LANDS AND OURPEOPLE HAVE PUT A LOT OF VALUE
INTO THE NAME DENALI OF THEMOUNTAIN.
IT MEANS THE HIGH ONE OR THEGREAT ONE.
>> THIS MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN NAMEDAFTER McKINLEY SINCE 1896.
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT REWRITE100 YEARS OF HISTORY?
>> 100 YEARS OF HISTORY IS LIKETHE BLINK OF AN EYE FOR MY
PEOPLE.
WE'VE BEEN HERE OVER 10,000YEARS.
>> 10,000?
REALLY?
(BLEEP).
BUT LUCKILY, PEOPLE WHO DON'TLIVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE
MOUNTAINEN ARE ABLE TO STOP THEGEOGRAPHIC BOARD OF NAMES FROM
CONSIDERING THIS OUTRAGEOUSPROPOSAL.
AND PROUD OHIOANS LIKE KIM KENNYOF THE McKINLEY MUSEUM AND
LIBRARY THINK McKINLEY'SLEGACY IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
>> THE PEOPLE OF OHIO ARE VERYADAMANT THAT WE WANT THE NAME TO
STAY MT. McKINLEY.
HE HAD A LOT OF CONTRIBUTIONS TOOUR NATION AND DESERVES IT.
>> BECAUSE HE WAS THE FIRST ONETO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.
>> HE DIDN'T CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN.
>> WAS THE FIRST AMERICANPRESIDENT TO SEE THE MOUNTAIN.
>> HE NEVER SAW THE MOUNTAIN.
>> HE DID SO MUCH FOR ALASKA.
>> ALASKA WAS NOT A STATE AT THETIME.
>> WHAT IS IT THAT HAS TO DOWITH OHIO?
>> WELL, IT'S OUR PRESIDENTWHOSE NAME IS ON A MOUNTAIN AND
HE WAS THE BEST PRESIDENT WHOCAME FROM OHIO.
>> ONE OF OUR GREATESTPRESIDENTS?
>> ABOVE AVERAGE PRESIDENT.
HE'S NOT ONE OF THE BESTPRESIDENTS BUT NOT THE WORST.
>> THAT COUNTS FOR SMRKS NOTBEING THE WORST.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> IT'S GOTTA HURT WHEN THECURATOR OF YOUR OWN MUSEUM
THINKS YOU'RE JUST ALL RIGHT.
BUT THE PEOPLE OF CANTON, OHIOWON'T STOP FIGHTING FOR THEIR
FAVORITE MEDIOCRE SON.
>> ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW A LOTABOUT HIM.
>> HE DONE ALL KIND OF THINGS.
HE VOTED FOR THE CONSTITUTION.
>> YOU DON'T LIKELY KNOW (BLEEP)ABOUT PRESIDENT McKINLEY, BUT
YOU DO KNOW YOU DEFINITELYSHOULDN'T CHANGE THE NAME OF THE
MOUNTAIN.
>> RIGHT. THEY SHOULDN'T CHANGEIT.
>> BUT AS HE SHOWED ME HISALASKA HOME, IT WAS CLEAR HE
NEED ADD LESSON IN THE GLORYTHAT IS OHIO.
>> THIS IS A LAND THAT PROVIDESA LIVING FOR OUR PEOPLE.
>> YOU SHOULD SEE CANTON, A GIFTSHOP, A PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF
FAME EVERYONE HAS TO SEE ONCE INTHEIR LIFE.
THE SPIRIT OF PRESIDENT McKINLEYWAS EVERYWHERE I LOOKED.
LOOK, A BIG DOG.
>> WE CALL THAT INJUCK.
A MOOSE AND BABY MOOSE.
ONE OF THE PRIMARY FOOD SOURCESOF OUR PEOPLE.
>> THAT'S NICE AND ALL, BUT DOYOU KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES ME
THINK OF?
McKINLEY HAD A PARROT NAMED"WASHINGTON POST," I THINK, THAT
SANG YANKEE DOODLE.
SO...
SADLY, HE STILL DIDN'T GET IT.
>> WHEN SOMEONE COMES HERE ANDTRIES TO RENAME IT, A PERSON
WHO'S NEVER BEEN TO ALASKA INTHE FIRST PLACE, IT'S A
DISRESPECT TO THE VALUE OF OURPEOPLE AND CULTURE.
>> BUT I'M SURE THE PEOPLE OFOHIO HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR
CONTINUING THE FIGHT.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE NAMEGOT CHANGED?
>> MAPS EVERYWHERE, GOT TOCHANGE GOOGLE.
IT'S A HASSLE TO CHANGE A NAME.
YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THENAME.
>> SORRY NATIVE ALASKANS, WECAN'T HONOR YOUR HERITAGE
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A HASSLE.
>> YOU START UNNAMING A MOUNTAINAFTER A PRESIDENT, YOU FORGET
ALL ABOUT HIM AND IT'S A BADROAD TO GO DOWN.
>> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUTATHABASKAN CULTURE?
>> NOT A THING.
>> IT'D BE GOOD IF THER WAS AWAY TO REMIND PEOPLE AND
HELP PEOPLE LEARN A LITTLE BITABOUT IT.
>> SURE.
>> RENAMING A MOUNTAIN ISHASSLE, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S A
SACRIFICE ALASKANS MUST MAKE.
EXPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE SEVENOTHER INSIGNIFICANT PRESIDENTS
FROM OHIO WE SHOULD HONOR.
YOU COULD JUST OHIO THE [BLEEP]OUTTA THIS PLACE.
I DUB THEE RUTHERFOD B. HAYESMOUNTAIN.
THAT LOOKS LIKE A WILLIAM HENRYHARRISON PEAK OVER THERE.
THAT'S A TAFT HILL IF I'VE EVERSEEN ONE.
>> THAT'S AN EAST COAST WAY OFTHINKING I GUESS.
>> THANK YOU.
THIS HAD TO BE PART OF OHIO'SCULTURE OVER A CENTURY.
I HAD TO SEE IT CLOSE BUT OFCOURSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CLIMB
FOR (BLEEP).
♪ PRESIDENT McKINLEY ♪ PRESIDENT McKINLEY

THOSE ARE THE ACTUAL LYRICS TOTHAT SONG.
FINALLY, I WAS ON THE MOUNTAINTHAT REMINDED CANTON OF THEIR
BELOVED PRESIDENT.

MAYBE YOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEENDISRESPECTED FOR LONG ENOUGH.
>> WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHANGETHE TIDE AND HONOR THE PEOPLE OF
WHOSE LANDS WE LIVE ON.
THERE WAS, FROM THE GET-GO,RESISTANCE FROM OHIO.
>> YEAH, BECAUSE THEY'RE DICKS.
