[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> John: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS DOCUMENTARY
FILM MAKER.
HIS NEW DOCUMENTARY IS HBO'S
GASLANDS PART 2.
>> THIS IS THE WELL.
HERE YOU GO.
SO THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT THIS
TIME.
>> I'LL WALK AWAY FROM IT.
WHAT DO YOU?
WHAT DO YOU?
>> AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
ELL, WELL, WELL, WHO IS
GOING TO BUY IT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WELL, WHAT I'LL PROBABLY DO IS
SELL THIS AND HAVE THE GAS
COMPANY SUE ME FOR SELLING THEIR
GAS.
>> John: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO
THE SHOW JOSH FOX.
IT'S SEQUEL TIME.
IN GASLAND ONE WE LEARN ABOUT
THE DANGERS OF FRACKING AND YOU
INTRODUCE US TO THE CONCEPT OF
FLAMMABLE WATER.
IN GASLAND 2, IT TURNS OUT
EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW.
RIGHT?
>> NO, IT DOESN'T GET BETTER.
THIS FILM, YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO
FIND OUT IF WHAT WE'RE SEEING
ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE PEOPLE
BEING ABLE TO LIGHT THEIR WATER
ON FIRE IN THE FACE OF THE
HUGEST DOMESTIC GASP DRILLING
CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY.
WHY HASN'T THE GOVERNMENT DONE
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?
WHY HAVE OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES
FAILED TO PROTECT AMERICANS?
SO THIS FILM WAS AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE
GOVERNMENT.
WHAT YOU SAW THERE WAS A FAMILY
IN TEXAS, ONE OF MANY MANY
FAMILIAR FILM THAT CAN LIGHT
THEIR WATER ON FIRE.
THERE WATER WELL HAS SO MUCH GAS
VENTING OFF THE HEAD SPACE OF
THAT WATER WELL THAT THAT
HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE TIME.
>> John: I MEAN THAT IS THE
GIMMICK.
THAT IS KIND OF THE MOST
PLEASANT PART OF CONSEQUENCES.
AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS
A TOY REALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT
THING IS, OH, I DON'T KNOW
POISONED WATER.
>> RIGHT.
NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY HAS COME IN
AND LITERALLY TAKEN AWAY THE
REGULATORY AGENCIES FROM THE
PEOPLE, HAS ADVISED EVEN THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO GO ON THE SIDE OF MORE AND
MORE FRACKING.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ONE
TO TWO MILLION NEW GAS WELLS IN
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
THAT'S THE PLAN.
HOW IS IT THAT IF SO MANY PEOPLE
ARE COMING FORWARD, WE HAVE A
THOUSAND FAMILIES IN
PENNSYLVANIA ALONE PETITIONING
THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION ABOUT WATER
CONTAMINATION AFTER THEY'VE
DRILLED 6,000 WELLS IN THE MAR
CELL US SHELL IN PENNSYLVANIA.
HOW IS THIS A STAPLE OF OUR
CLIMATE POLICY?
THIS IS THE QUESTION OF THIS
FILM.
ANSWER IS THERE.
WE SEE THAT THE GAS... IT HAS
WAYS OF INFLUENCING EVERY LEVEL
OF GOVERNMENT.
>> John: NOW THE COUNTERPOINT
COMES IN YOUR MOVIE FROM THE GAS
COMPANY'S MASCOT THE FRIENDLY
FRACK-A-SAURUS.
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE ASKING
ME TO BELIEVE BUT HE IS, NO
OFFENSE, A LOT CUTER THAN YOU.
>> HE'S ALSO DRILLING INTO HIS
OWN ANCESTORS' REMAINS.
>> John: THAT'S NOT THE FRIENDLY
PART.
YOU SEE,.
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE
NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY DO IS WE'RE
FRIENDLY.
WE BURN CLEANER THAN COAL.
IT TURNS OUT THIS IS NOT TRUE AT
ALL.
ACTUALLY THAT PART IS TRUE.
IT'S LIKE THE WITCHES IN
MACBETH.
YOU'RE GOING TO THE KING.
THEY LEAVE OUT THE PART ABOUT
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KILL
ALL YOUR FRIENDS.
YOUR WIFE WILL COMMIT SUICIDE
AND YOU'LL BE DEAD IN THREE
DAYS.
THEY LEAVE THAT PART OUT.
WITH THIS THEY SAY WE BURN
CLEANER COAL.
THAT'S TRUE.
50% CLEANER BUT METHANE IS 105
TIMES, NATURAL GAS, 105 TIMES
MORE POTENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE
THAN CARBON DIOXIDE.
THEY'RE LEAKING HUGE CLOUDS OF
METHANE OFF THESE WELL SITES,
LEAKING INTO THE DISTRIBUTION
SYSTEM.
ANY MORE THAN ONE PERCENT
LEAKAGE MEANS THAT NATURAL GAS
DEVELOPMENT IS WORSE THAN COAL
FOR CLIMATE.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE YESTERDAY
IS THAT THE PRESIDENT, WE KNOW
HE'S MET WITH THE NATURAL GAS
INDUSTRY MANY MANY TIMES.
WE'RE ASKING WILL HE PLEASE MEET
WITH THE FAMILIES IN THIS FILM.
WILL HE PLEASE MEET WITH THE
SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHO ARE
COMING FORWARD SAYING LOOK THE
ENGINEERING OF THESE WELLS IS
FATALLY FLAWED.
WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO
CONTAMINATE AQUA FERS.
NO WAY TO FIX THEM.
METHANE LEAKING IS UNFIXABLE AT
THE LEVEL WE'RE SEEING IT.
THAT MEANS THAT IT'S WORSE THAN
COAL.
WE WOULD LIKE THE PRESIDENT TO
MEET WITH THESE SCIENTISTS AND
MEET WITH THESE FAMILIES IN THE
FILM.
>> John: DO THOSE FAMILIES HAVE
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CAMPAIGN
MONEY?
>> NO.
John: THAT MIGHT BE YOUR
PROBLEM THEN.
>> YEAH, YEAH, THEY DON'T.
THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY A PIECE OF
THE ISSUE THOUGH.
INFLUENCE DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN
THROUGH THE MONEY BUT THE MONEY
IS IS THERE.
$747 MILLION SPENT IN CONGRESS
TO GET AN EXEMPTION TO THE SAFE
DRINKING WATER ACT.
THAT'S THREE QUARTERS OF A
BILLION DOLLARS.
VERY, VERY HARD TO COMPETE ON
THAT LEVEL.
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE
BOARD IN NEW YORK STATE THE
PEOPLE OF THIS STATE CAMPAIGNED,
THEY HAD 204,000 PUBLIC COMMENTS
TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
STUDY IN NEW YORK STATE.
MORE PEOPLE THAN VOTED FOR
ANDREW CUOMO IN HIS HOME AREA OF
QUEENS.
THERE IS NO GAS DRILLING IN NEW
YORK STATE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
RIGHT NOW... THANK YOU.
WE ALSO KNOW THIS PENNSYLVANIA
TWO-THIRDS OF PEOPLE IN
PENNSYLVANIA SUPPORT A
MORATORIUM ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA.
IT IS NOW THE OFFICIAL POSITION
OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN
PENNSYLVANIA TO SUPPORT A
MORATORIUM.
>> John: DO YOU HAVE TIME TO GO
TO THE WEB.
THIS IS A BIGGER DISCUSSION THAN
WE CAN HAVE IN 4.5 MINUTES.
>> THE FILM IS ON HBO JULY 8.
John: GASLAND PART 2.
JOSH FOX, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
