ROB FORD, THE TORONTO MAYOR WHOPUTS CRACK SMOKING IN TORONTO
CRACK SMOKING MAYOR ROB FORD.SO, WHAT HAS HE BEEN UP TO
LATELY? WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROMHIM.

TAKE A HEALTHY DRINK OFWATER WHILE I FIND OUT WHAT IS
UP WITH ROB FORD.
>> TROUBLED TORONTO MAYOR ROBFORD BACK IN THE NEWS AGAIN.
>> ANOTHER VIDEO ALLEGEDLY
SHOWING FORD SMOKING CRACKCOCAINE.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED I
DIDN'T SPIT OUT MY WATER.
[ LAUGHTER ]BECAUSE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]AS FAR AS ANNOUNCEMENTS GO IT'S
NOT VERY SURPRISING.
PERHAPS I'LL FINISH THE WHOLECUP.
>> ON WEDNESDAY TORONTO'SMAYORAL CAMPAIGN WAS BROUGHT TO
A STAND STILL WHEN ROB FORDANNOUNCED HE WAS ENTERING REHAB.
>> Jon: WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]OH, MY -- YES!

THAT IS A SURPRISE.
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.
IN FACT ROB FORD GOING TO REHABNUMBER ONE ON THE LIST OF THINGS
I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.
I THOUGHT MAYBE BABY PRESIDENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO TELL ME, VERY QUICKLY, WHO
WAS THE CITIZEN JOURNALIST WHOBROUGHT THESE LATEST REVELATIONS
TO LIGHT?
>> THE VIDEO HAD BEEN SHOT BY ADRUG DEALER WHO WAS ATTEMPTING
TO SELL IT FOR AT LEAST SIXFIGURES.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: EITHER THAT DRUG
DEALER IS A KEEBLER ELF ORSMOKING CRACK MAKES ROB FORD
NINE FEET TALL. BY THE WAY,
SIX FIGURES FOR THE VIDEO OF THECRACK MAYOR SMOKING CRACK?
KIND OF SURPRISED I HAVE TO SAYTHIS TO A DRUG DEALER BUT LET ME
EXPLAIN SUPPLY AND DEMAND TOYOU.
WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF AN ITEMLIKE BANANAS OR SOCKS OR VIDEOS
OF ROB FORD SMOKING CRACK.
PRICE TENDS TO DROP. IF YOU WANTTO MAKE SIX FIGURES,
YOU WANT A VIDEO OF SOMETHINGRARE. JUSTIN BIEBER
STOPPING A BRATTY KID FROM BEINGA PUBLIC NUISANCE OR
A PANDA GANG BANG KNOWN IN THEBUSINESS AS PANG PANG.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT BUSINESSTHAT IS BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S
KNOWN AS.

VALUABLE.
IT'S NOT EVEN THE CRAZIEST THINGTHAT ROB FORD GOT CAUGHT DOING
THIS WEEK.

SCALE ROB FORD HAS TO ADMIT HISPOLITICAL REAR IS DONE.

ASIDE --[ APPLAUSE ]
