BUT, NOW LET'S TURN TO CONGRESS.
OBVIOUSLY GREAT NEWS ON THECEASEFIRE.
CONGRESS, THOUGH, HAS A LOT TOGET DONE BEFORE THEIR SUMMER
RECESS, WHICH IS GOING TO START,OH, NOW.
IT IS NOW.
>> THE BORDER BILL.
>> A HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL.
>> EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE.
>> STUDENT LOAN RELIEF.
>> COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATIONREFORM.
>> IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHINGTO FIX THAT, THEN BY THE TIME WE
LEAVE HERE FOR THE AUGUSTRECESS, WE WILL HAVE FAILED.
>> Jon: STOP.
STOP IT.
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
[LAUGHTER]WHEN YOU GUYS SUCK, IT IS NOT
FAILURE. IT IS JUST YOU LIVINGUP TO OUR EXTREMELY
LOW EXPECTATIONS OF YOU.
[LAUGHTER]CONGRESS IS THE "SHARKNADO 2"
OF GOVERNMENT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]OF COURSE, OF COURSE IT SUCKED.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SUCK.
[LAUGHTER]BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS
LIKE THE HEAR THAT KIND OFURGENCY FROM MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOINGTO DO FIRST THERE?
BORDER CRISIS? STUDENT LOANS?
HOW ABOUT A NICE LITTLEBUDGET RESOLUTION?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
>> WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BRING THISLEGISLATION FORTH TODAY TO SUE
THE PRESIDENT OVER HIS SELECTIVEIMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT.
>> Jon: OKAY. OKAY.
OR YOU COULD TO THAT.
THAT COULD... LOOK, CONGRESS, WETALKED ABOUT THIS.
YOU HAVE TO PASS THE LAWS ONYOUR PLATE, ALL OF THEM, BEFORE
YOU GET DESSERT, WHICH IN THISCASE IS YOU SUING THE PRESIDENT.
LOOK, THAT'S YOUR PRIORITY?
SURE, THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTKIDS ARE SLEEPING UNDER OUR
BRIDGES, WHICH, BY THE WAY, ARECOLLAPSING BECAUSE OF THE
HIGHWAY STRUCTURES FUNDINGBILLS, BUT IF WE GO ON BREAK
WITHOUT SUING THE PRESIDENT,WE'LL NEVER REACH
CHARLIE RANGEL LEVELS OFRELAXATION ON OUR BREAK.
[APPLAUSE]LOOK, WHY ARE YOU SUING THE
PRESIDENT?
>> OUR FOUNDERS, THEY UNDERSTOODTHAT TOO MUCH POWER IN THE HANDS
OF ANY ONE PERSON OR ANY ONEGROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD INEVITABLY
LEAD TO TYRANNY.
>> Jon: OH, FOR [BLEEPED]SAKE.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE A WHILE.
CARRY ON.
>> OUR FOUNDING FATHERSUNDERSTOOD THE DANGER OF HAVING
A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLYENFORCED THE LAWS BUT MADE THEM.
>> ARE YOU WILLING TO LET ANYONETEAR APART WHAT OUR FOUNDERS
HAVE BUILT?
>> WE CANNOT STAND BY AND WATCHTHE PRESIDENT SHRED OUR
CONSTITUTION.
>> THAT TYPE OF ACTION AMOUNTSTO TYRANNY, MR. SPEAKER,
TYRANNY.
>> Jon: WHAT?
HUH?
THE BRITISH ARE COMING, THEBRITISH ARE COMING!
YES, IT'S TYRANNY.
OBAMA'S A TYRANT.
WE ALL KNOW THROUGHOUT HISTORYTHE ONLY WAY TO DEPOSE A TYRANT
IS VIA A CIVIL LAWSUIT.
[LAUGHTER]I THINK I REMEMBER CAESAR'S
FAMOUS LAST WORDS, "ET SUE,BRUTE?"
LOOK, LOOK, MAKE NO MISTAKE,THIS ENTIRELY NECESSARY
AND EFFECTIVE LAWSUIT WASN'TA MATTER OF PARTNERSHIP
BUT OF PRINCIPLE.
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS.
IF THERE WERE A REPUBLICANPRESIDENT DOING THE SAME THING,
I WOULD FEEL JUST AS STRONGLY.
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S BULL[BLEEP.]
[LAUGHTER]IT'S JUST, I MEAN, IT'S JUST, IT
JUST IS [BLEEPED]. ITJUST IS [BLEEPED].
LOOK, THIS LADY WAS IN CONGRESSWHEN THEN-PRESIDENT BUSH IN 2006
TOOK EXECUTIVE ACTION TO WAIVEOR EXTEND DEADLINES ON FINANCIAL
PENALTIES CLEARLY WRITTEN INTOTHE MEDICARE PART D HEALTH CARE
LAW.
NOW, SINCE THAT WAS PRETTY MUCHEXACTLY IDENTICAL EXECUTIVE
ACTION TO THE ONE YOU'RE NOWSUING PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR, LET'S
FLASH BACK TO THEN AND CHECK OUTTHE REPUBLICANS AND
CONGRESSWOMAN FOX'SJUST-AS-STRONG REACTION TO THAT
TYRANNY.
>> HEY!
HEY!
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
>> Jon: TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIRTO THE REPUBLICANS, BEFORE THEY
DECIDED TO SUE THE PRESIDENT,THEY TRIED OFFICIAL CHANNELS OF
COMMUNICATION TO MAKE THEIRVOICE HEARD.
>> REWRITING OBAMA CARE ISN'TONLY ONE OF THE WAYS THIS
PRESIDENT HAS ABUSED HIS POWER.
LAST WEEK I SENT THE PRESIDENT21 TWEETS, WHICH LAID OUT THE
THINGS THAT HE COULD DO TO STOPTHIS MESS AT THE BORDER.
>> Jon: 21 TWEETS!
A RALLYING CRY FOR VICTORY.
21 TWEETS, WHY THAT'S ALMOST3,000 CHARACTERS.
OF COURSE, SPLIT OVER THETIMELINE BETWEEN RETWEETS AND
@ REPLIES, HASHTAG GAMES, INADDITION TO THE OTHER BILLIONS
OF PAGES OF TWEETINGCOMPLAINTS THAT THE PRESIDENT
RECEIVES EVERY [BLEEPED] SECONDOF THE DAY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE
PRESIDENT WOULDN'T EVENTAKE THE TIME TO AT LEAST
FAVE ONE OF THOSE.
[LAUGHTER]ALTHOUGH I GUESS IT IS SHOCKING,
CONGRESSMAN, THAT THE MEDIUMCHRIS BROWN USES [BLEEPED] TO
TALK DRAKE IS NOT AN EFFECTIVELEGISLATIVE TOOL.
SO HOUSE REPUBLICANS DECIDED TOSPEND THEIR LAST HOURS IN
SESSION INDULGING IN EMPTY,TIME-WASTING POLITICAL THEATER.
HOUSE DEMOCRATS WERE LEFT ONLYONE OPTION.
IMPOTENT ANGER.
>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER ISTHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
TIRED OF THE RELENTLESSPARTNERSHIP THAT HAS LED THE
CONGRESS TO HAVING A LOWERAPPROVAL RATING THAN HEAD LICE.
>> Jon: OH, HO, LOWER THANHEAD LICE.
WAIT.
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
I HEAR A CELEBRATION.
CHUCK, CAN WE GET A CLOSE-UP OFTHE CELEBRATION?
>> WE DID IT.
WE'RE NOT THE MOST HATEDTHING.
>> Jon: GOOD FOR YOU, HEADLICE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
AND AS FOR YOU, PUBIC LICE, HANGIN THERE.
CONGRESS KEEPS GOING THE WAYIT'S GOING, YOU'LL GET YOUR
SHOT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
