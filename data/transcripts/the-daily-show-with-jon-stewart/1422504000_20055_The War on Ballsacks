( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK!
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IN THE REALAMERICA, PEOPLE RIDE PICKUP
TRUCKS, AND FIX YOUR FLAT FIRES,BUT IF YOU LIVE IN THE CITY, YOU
GOT YOUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,WHERE PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF
LIFE COME TOGETHER TO ANNOY EACHOTHER,
IN VERY CLOSE SPACE.
( LAUGHTER )THEY'RE ALWAYS FINDING NEW WAYS
TO DO IT.
>> IT'S A BATTLE AGAINST MANSPREADING.
>> IT IS A GUY TAKING UP TWOSEATS.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEMETROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION
AUTHORITY IS ASKING MEN TO MINDTHE GAP.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  "MIND THE GAP."
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE NICESTWAY TO SAY, "DON'T BE AN
ASHOLE IN THE SUBWAY."
AND YET, WHAT SEEMS LIKE ASIMPLE QUESTION OF MANNERS,
TAKING UP TWO SEATS WHEN YOUCOULD TAKE UP ONE
HAS SOMEHOW OPENED A NEW FRONTIN THE CULTURE WAR.
>> LEG-SPREADERS, THEY'RE THEWORST.
MEN, BAD. YEAH.
>> IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE. YEAH.
>> YEAH. THE OTHER ONE'S ALITTLE RESTRAINING.
>> MEN'S GROUPS ARE CALLING ITMALE OPPRESSION.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  AND APPARENTLY CALLING
THEMSELVES MEN'S GROUPS.
TAKE THAT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED MY SENIORWOMEN'S ISSUES CORRESPONDENT,
KRISTIN SCHAAL.
KRISTIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> THIS IS A BIG DEAL, JON, AND
I JUST WANT TO SAY, MEN, I'MSORRY.
YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY HAVE THATEXTRA SEAT.
YOU DESERVE THAT EXTRA SEAT.
WELL, DO THE MATH.
MEN MAKE 30% MORE THAN WOMEN.
THEY SHOULD HAVE 30% MORE SPACEON THE RIDE TO WORK.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  IT'S NOT, KRISTEN,THAT'S NOT EVEN WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE OF COMMONCOURTESY ON THE SUBWAYS.
>> OH, NO, JON.
YOU'VE BEEN SO BRAINWASHED BYTHIS FEMINIZED WORLD, YOU CAN'T
EVEN SEE EVERYTHING THAT MENHAVE LOST.
( LAUGHTER )YOU USED TO RUN COMPANIES BY
YOURSELF.
YOU USED TO RUN COUNTRIES BYYOURSELF.
YOU USED TO DO EVERYTHING.
JUST YOU DUDES.
AND IF A WOMAN SHOWED UP, YOUGOT TO CALL HER SUGAR TITS WITH
NO CONSEQUENCES AND GIVE HER ASEAT IN THE TYPE WRITER POOL
WITH ALL THE OTHER SUGAR TITSES.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon: MINOR POINT.
I THINK IT'S TITSI. TITSI.
>> THE SUBWAY IS THE ONLY PLACEMEN HAVE LEFT.
WE HAVE LITERALLY DRIVEN YOUUNDERGROUND TO FIND THAT LAST
INCH OF BALL SPACE -- AND NOWSOCIETY IS SAYING NO!
EVEN THERE A MAN'S PLACE IS ONONE SEAT, KNEES TOGETHER.
AS A WOMAN WHO HAS STRUGGLED HERENTIRE LIFE TO KEEP HER KNEES
TOGETHER, I AM YOUR ALLY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  WELL--, YOU KNOW--

SEAT DOES GRANT YOU A GOODAMOUNT OF BALL SPACE.
IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT-->> WOW.

THEY'RE ALLERGIC TO WOOL.
>> COME ON, JON, JUST GET ITTOGETHER.
OCCUPYING ALL THE TERRITORY YOUCAN IS SEXY.
WHEN I'M ON A SUBWAY CAR WITHALL THOSE MEN TAKING CHARGE OF
THE SEATS AROUND THEM, I GET SOWEAK IN THE KNEES, I CAN BARELY
STAND, BUT I HAVE TO.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  SEE, THAT-- THAT SEEMS-- THAT'S SEEMS RUDE TO MAKE YOU
STAND IN THAT.
>> JON, WHO IS THE MANLIEST MANIN THE WORLD?
