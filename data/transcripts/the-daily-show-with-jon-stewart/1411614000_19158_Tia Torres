THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> GOOD, NO, IT'S GREAT.
>> Jon: I LOVE THIS SHOW.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WHAT YOU DO TOREHABILITATE THE IMAGE OF
THE PIT BULL AND ALSOPAROLEES, IT'S THESE TWO
GROUPS.
SOMEWHAT DISCOUNTED BYSOCIETY.
AND YOU SEE THEM COMETOGETHER IN COMMON CAUSE.
AND IT'S REALLY QUITEBEAUTIFUL.
>> WELL YOU KNOW, THE GUYSACTUALLY TELL US, THE PAROLLEES
ACTUALLY THEY SAY THAT THEY CANRELATE TO THESE DOGS BECAUSE
THEY FEEL VERY MUCH IN TOUCHWITH THEM AS FAR AS THE
IMAGE THAT IS PORTRAYED BYBOTH GROUPS.
THE DIFFERENCE BEING, ANDTHIS IS BY THEIR OWN WORDS,
IS THAT THE PIT BULLS HAVEDONE NOTHING WRONG TO END UP
IN, YOU KNOW, DOGGIE JAIL...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> UNLIKE THE GUYS WHO MAKEMISTAKES AND END UP IN PRISON.
THEY SAID, SO ESPECIALLY THEDOG DOES NOT DESERVE THE
TREATMENT THAT THEY GET.
>> Jon: IT'S AMAZING.
AND THE ONLY THING I WANT TOMAKE SURE OF BECAUSE REALITY
TELEVISION, YOU JUST NEVERKNOW.
THIS IS REAL, RIGHT?
THIS IS ISN'T LIKE PEOPLEDRESSED UP AS DOGS AND LIKE
OTHER GUYS...>> NOPE.
>> Jon: THIS IS A REAL SHOW.>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU REALLY DO THIS GOODTHING.
BECAUSE IT'S A REMARKABLEAND AS I WATCH THE SHOW,
INCREDIBLY TAXING.
YOU KNOW, YOU DO IT WITH YOURWHOLE FAMILY.
THE TWO DAUGHTERS, TWO SONS,THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS,
THIS WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE.
AND IT'S RELENTLESS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND IT NEVER SEEMSTO STOP.
>> IT'S 200% REAL.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> 200% REAL. YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT'S A LOT OFREAL.
>> YEAH, WE ARE THE REAL.
YEAH, WE ARE THE REAL.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE SOME OF THESTORIES THAT GIVE YOU THE
HEART TO KEEP CONTINUING ASTHESE DOGS JUST KEEP COMING IN.
WERE THERE ANY IN PARTICULARTHAT YOU THOUGHT, BOY
THAT'S A STORY THAT GIVESME THE STRENGTH TO KEEP
DOING THIS.
>> YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY,WE WERE ACTUALLY TALKING
ABOUT THIS IN THE GREEN ROOMWITH SOME OF YOUR PEOPLE.
SINCE MOVING TO LOUISIANA, ANDTHE SOUTH IN GENERAL, THE WAY--
>> Jon: YOU CAME FROMCALIFORNIA.
>> WE CAME FROM CALIFORNIAORIGINALLY, YEAH, THREE YEARS
AGO.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND THE WAY THAT DOGS AREDISCARDED OR TREATED IN THE
SOUTH IS DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> IT'S JUST A CULTURALDIFFERENCE.
A LOT OF DOGS ARE JUST CHAINEDUP IN THE BACKYARD, THEY'RE LEFT
TO JUST KIND OF FEND FORTHEMSELVES, YOU KNOW,
RUNNING AROUND YOUR PROPERTY,ON THE STREETS.
SO NOT EVERYBODY, BUT IT ISPRETTY COMMON.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> AND THE SAD PART IS THESOUTH, ESPECIALLY IN THE
LOUISIANA WHERE WE ARE AT,THEY DON'T HAVE THE
RESOURCES THAT WE DID INCALIFORNIA OR LIKE HERE IN
NEW YORK, WITH ANIMALSHELTERS, THE HUMANE SOCIETIES.
SO YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE YOU AREON YOUR OWN, YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE IN GROUND ZERO WHENARE YOU OUT THERE.
>> Jon: WHERE DO YOU GETRESOURCES THEN, IS THAT JUST,
DOES THE SHOW HELP WITH THAT?
CAN THEY, YOU KNOW, FREE YOUGUYS TO DO THAT?
WILL THEY THROW YOU A COUPLEDOGGY BEDS?
>> IT'S YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, YOUKNOW, THERE'S GOOD AND BAD THAT
COMES WITH HAVING A SHOW.
YES, WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLETHAT NOTICE US NOW AND SAY WELL,
I WANT TO ADOPT A DOG...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT WE ALSO GET, YOU KNOW,QUADRUPLE THE
AMOUNT OF DOGS COMING IN, ANDPEOPLE NEEDING THE HELP.
SO IT SOMEWHAT HASBACKFIRED A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS
THE NUMBER OF DOGS.
WE ARE UP TO A LITTLE OVER400 DOGS RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE 400 DOGS.
AND THAT IS ALL IN ONESTUDIO APARTMENT.
THAT IS AMAZING.
(LAUGHTER)>> YES.
>> Jon: JUST STACKED UP.>> YES, YES.
>> Jon: IS THE FACILITY YOURS?ALSO PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE
LAND THAT YOU HAD.
>> NO, AND IN CALIFORNIA WE HADA BIG RANCH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO NOW WE'RE LIVING IN AMORE URBAN TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT SO WE HAVE LIKE ABIG WAREHOUSE BUILDING, LIKE AN
ANIMAL SHELTER.
WE HAVE THREE OF THEMNOW.
>> Jon: WHAT IS IT THAT ITTAKES TO REHABILITATE A DOG
AND THEN CONVINCE PEOPLE ANDMAKE THAT MATCH?
BECAUSE THE INTERESTINGTHING ABOUT THE SHOW IS
PEOPLE WILL COME IN AND EXPRESSINTEREST.
BUT YOU ARE VERY RELUCTANTTO MAKE A MATCH WITH A DOG
UNLESS IT'S RIGHT. THEREHAS TO BE A CERTAIN--
CERTAIN DOGS NEED A CERTAINENVIRONMENT.
AND YOU ARE VERY STRICTABOUT THAT.
>> I WILL TELL YOU WHY.
BESIDES THE OBVIOUS, WHICH ISWE WANT THE DOGS TO HAVE
THE BEST HOMES BECAUSE OFWHERE THEY CAME FROM, WE'RE
DEALING WITH A BREED THAT,YOU KNOW, SOCIETY HAS WAITED
FOR IT TO DO SOMETHING WRONGSO THEY CAN JUST THROW US
ALL UNDER THE BUS.
AND THE THING IS, YOU KNOW, IKNEW WHO JON STEWART WAS BEFORE
I KNEW WHO THE DAILY SHOW WASBECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A PIT BULL
ADVOCATE.
>> I ENJOY THEM.
>> AND SO, I KNEW WHO YOU WEREJUST BECAUSE OF YOUR LOVE FOR
THE BREED YEARS AGO.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND WE ARE ALWAYS OUT THEREHAVING TO WATCH OUT FOR OUR
DOGS.
SO WHEN IT COMES TO ADOPTINGTHEM OUT, YOU KNOW, WE ONLY WANT
THE BEST OF THE BEST OUT THERETO REPRESENT OUR BREED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND MUCH OF THE TIME IT'STHE OWNERS ARE MAKING THESE
STUPID MISTAKES WITH THESE DOGSAND IT BACKFIRES ON ALL OF US.
>> Jon: I THINK IT'SDIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A
DOG THAT IS -- THE THINGS THATMAKE THAT DOG SUCH A SPECIAL
DOG, ITS LOYALTY, ITSPLAYFULNESS, ITS STRENGTH.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: CAN BE TURNED AGAINSTIT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND USED IN A MANNERTHAT IS MORE OF A THREAT.
>> IT IS ALSO A BREED THATIS SO WILLING TO PLEASE ITS
OWNER THEY ALMOST BECOMETHEIR OWN WORST ENEMY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I KIND OF MAKE A SIDE JOKE,LIKE I SAY, GERMAN SHEPHERD,
BORDER COLIES ARE VERY SMARTDOGS, THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO
KNOW WHEN A HUMAN ISMISTREATING THEM.
OUR DOGS ARE JUST LIKE THESE BIGDUMB DOPEY DOGS THAT GO...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OKAY, BEAT ME SOME MORE, ISTILL LOVE YOU THOUGH.
>> Jon: RIGHT, THEY AREINCREDIBLY AFFECTIONATE DOGS.
>> AND VERY FORGIVING. VERYFORGIVING.
>> Jon: AND YOU DON'T GET THESENSE, BECAUSE I WILL BE HONEST
WITH YOU, I LOOK AT CATSSOMETIMES AND I LOOK AT SOME OF
THESE OTHER DOGS AND THINK, IF IDIE, THIS GUY IS EATING ME.
MAYBE WITHIN LIKE FOUR ORFIVE HOURS.
LIKE, THIS IS, I FEEL LIKEWITH THE PIT BULL, THEY
WOULD ACTUALLY CONTINUE TOTRY AND GET HELP.
