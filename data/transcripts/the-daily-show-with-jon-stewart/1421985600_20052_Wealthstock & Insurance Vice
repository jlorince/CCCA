"CAKE."
IT'S DELICIOUS.
NO, SHE'S -- SHE'S UNBELIEVABLEIN IT.
BUT FIRST, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME--NO?
ALL RIGHT?
YOU WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH ADIFFICULT-TO-ARTICULATE SENSE OF
PANIC, A KIND OFDIRECTIONLESSNESS, AS THOUGH
HALF OF OUR WEALTH AND ALMOSTALL OF OUR POWER WAS UNACCOUNTED
FOR IT WITH STRANGELY 99.99% OFOUR PEOPLE STILL HERE.
YOU'RE NOT IMAGINING THINGS.
>> THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC FORUM ISUNDER WAY IN DAVOS, SWITZERLAND.
IT IS THE ANNUAL GATHERING OFTHE WORLD'S FINANCIAL AND
POLITICAL ELITE AT THE SWISSRESORT.
>> Jon:  AH!

WHERE THE ELITE MEET TO EATPANDA MEAT.
OFF A CALL GIRL'S FEET.
MMM!
TRY TO GET A TABLE.
THAT'S -- MMM.
I WISH THERE WAS ONE PERFECTFACT TO EXPLAIN THE KIND OF
EVENT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUMREALLY IS.

I'M NOT SURE-- I DON'T KNOW HOWYOUR TAINT WOULD WORK HARD
ANYWAY, BUT STILL.
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVETO FLY YOUR OWN PRIVATE
PLANE.
CAN'T YOU JUST JET POOL?
AND WHAT IS THE TOPIC OFDISCUSSION THIS YEAR THAT IS SO
IMPORTANT THAT NOBODY COULDWAIT FOR A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT.
>> CLIMATE CHANGE A BIG TOPIC ATTHE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  AS IN CAN YOUBELIEVE HOW MUCH CLIMATE WE
CHANGED?
ANY OTHER CONFERENCE TOPICS THATMAY SEEM, WHEN JUXTAPOSED WITH
THE WORLD'S LARGEST FLEET OFPRIVATE JETS, SEEM ACHINGLY
LACKING IN AWARENESS.
>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUESHERE IN DAVOS IS THE ISSUE OF
GLOBAL INEQUALITY.
>> Jon:  OH, YES!
GLOBAL INEQUALITY!
IT'S ACTUALLY THE IN-FLIGHTMAGAZINE OF THE 1700-STRONG
DAVOS JET FLEET.
WHO AM I KIDDING?
COME ON, I'M EXCITED.
COME ON FINANCIAL NETWORKS,INTRODUCE THE INDIVIDUALS ARE
YOU SUPPOSEDLY COVERING ASJOURNALISTS AS THOUGH THEY WERE
SUPERSTARS YOU WOULD DO ANYTHINGTO ( BLEEP ).
>> THE SUPER BOWLS OF BUSINESSGATHERING IN DAVOS.
WE'VE GOT SOME TRUE ALL STARS.
>> THE LINEUP INCLUDES GOLDMANSACHS' LLOYD BLANKFEIN.
>> BLACKROCK'S LARRY FINK.
>> AIG NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMANSTEVE MILLER.
>> PLUS CEOS FROM AETNA, DOWCHEMICAL, LENOVO, NOVARTIS,
AND A LOT MORE.
>> Jon: IT'S THE MONSTERS OFMONEY!
WITH SPECIAL APPEARANCES BYMONTGOMERY BURNS.
THE GHOST OF JOHND. ROCKEFELLER.
THE BIBLICAL PERSONIFICATIONOF THE SINFUL LUST FOR WEALTH,
MAMMON.
AN ICE SCULPTURE OF MARIEANTOINETTE WHO'S ( BLEEP )
CAVIAR.
BUT, OF COURSE, THE GET-TOGETHERIS NOT JUST A CELEBRATION BUT A
CHANCE FOR THE POWERFUL TOREFLECT ON HOW THE WORLD HAS
CHANGED SINCE THE DEVASTATINGFINANCIAL COLLAPSE.
THAT MANY OF THEM CAUSED AND AREPROFITING FROM.
J.P. MORGAN CHASE C.E.O. JAMIEDIMON.
>> YOU MADE SOME PROVOCATIVECOMMENTS LAST WEEK.
YOU SAID THAT THE BANK IS UNDERASSAULT FROM REGULATORS.
>> I WAS REFERRING TO THE FACTTHAT THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT
REGULATORS.
IT'S HARD TO DEAL WITH.
WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT.
MY JOB IS TO DEAL WITH IT, NOTTO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
>> Jon:  COMPLAINING ABOUTIT IS JUST MY PASSION.
( LAUGHTER )AND WHILE SOME HAVE CALLED FOR
GIANT BANKS LIKE JP MORGAN TO BEBROKEN UP, JAMIE DIMON
WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET YOUKNOW HOW HARD SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WOULD BE ON US.
>> A LOT OF MY DIRECTORS HAVEMENTIONED TO ME THAT SOME OF
THEIR COMPANIES WERE UNDER SOMEPRESSURE TO BREAK UP AND THANK
GOD THEY DIDN'T.>> RIGHT.
>> THE COMPANY ITSELF WAS A PORTOF SAFETY IN THE STORM.
WE WILL BE A PORT IN THE NEXTSTORM.
AND YOU WANT ME TO BE A PORT.>> RIGHT.
>> YOU WANT ME TO BE HERE.
>> Jon:  WHAT'S WITH THE"FEW GOOD MEN" ( BLEEP ).
YOU WANT ME ON THAT WALL STREET!
YOU NEED ME ON THAT WALL STREET!
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
WELL, YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT.
IT'S REALLY EXPRENSIVE, THETRUTH.
OF COURSE, NOT ALL THE FINANCIALINSTITUTIONS ARE DEFENSIVE ABOUT
REGULATIONS.
A.I.G. IS TAKING IT VERY WELL.
>> WHETHER WE THINK IT'S A GOODTHING OR NOT, WE'RE GOING TO
LIVE WITH IT AND MAKE THE BESTOF IT.
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.
ONE, IT IS A SECOND SET OF EYES.
THE SECOND THING IS WHEN WE GOTO OUR CLIENTS AND BROKERS AND
SO ON AND SAY, "2008 WILL NEVERHAPPEN AGAIN," PART OF THE
ANSWER IS I'VE GOT THE FEDLOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER SO WE
COULDN'T DO '08 AGAINIF WE WANTED TO.
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  FIRST OF ALL -- NO, NO,NO.
A, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?
WE COULDN'T COLLAPSE THE ECONOMYAGAIN IF WE WANTED TO.
NOT THAT WE WANT TO.
AND, ALSO, DO AN '08? IT'S GOODTO KNOW THAT THE FINANCIAL
COLLAPSE HAS FINALLY ACHIEVEDSNOOP LINGO STATUS.
DAMN HOMIE, DID YOU JUST '08THAT ( BLEEP )?
AND WHO JUST LEHMANED IN THEELEVATOR? WHAT'S UP?
SO THIS APPEARS TO BE THEPROBLEM THESE FINANCIAL TITANS
ARE ALL FACING.
THEY KNOW HOW GREAT THEY ARE BUTWE DON'T GET IT BECAUSE WE'RE
STILL REMEMBERING THE COLLAPSEOF THE ECONOMY THAT THEY DID.
SO THE QUANDARY IS, IF YOU'RETHEM, HOW DO YOU GET TO KEEP
CELEBRATING YOURSELF AT PLACESLIKE DAVOS WHILE STILL STAYING
BELOW THE RADAR.
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THECOMPANY METLIFE.
NOW METLIFE IS NOT JUST AREGRETTABLE TATTOO FROM MY
FAVORITE BASEBALL MASCOT.
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE ITHOUGHT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS
BASEBALL. IT REALLYIS JUST HIS HEAD.
THEY'RE ALSO A MASSIVE INSURANCECONGLOMERATE FACING A CHANGING
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.
>> REGULATORS HAVE DECLAREDINSURER METLIFE SO BIG
ITS FAILURE COULD DESTABILIZETHE FINANCIAL MARKETS.
>> METLIFE SAYS IT IS NOT TOOBIG TO FAIL.
>> METLIFE IS SUING THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon:  WHAT?
WE'RE NOT THAT BIG AND TO PROVEIT WE ARE TAKING ON THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
MANO A MANO IN A BATTLE OFEQUALS.
I MEAN, I HOPE WE CAN AFFORD IT.
LOOK, MAYBE GOVERNMENT IS WRONG.
I MEAN, WHO HAS EVEN BEENSPREADING THE IDEA THAT METLIFE
IS SOME GLOBAL ECONOMICCOLOSSUS ANYWAY?
♪  ♪( LAUGHTER )
♪  ♪( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  OH RIGHT, METLIFEHAS BEEN SPREADING THAT IDEA.
IN PRESENTATIONS TO ITSSHAREHOLDERS.
SO IF METLIFE BELIEVESTHEMSELVES TO BE A GIANT
CONGLOMERATE, WHAT'S THEIRPROBLEM WITH BEING LABELED
SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT ANYWAY?
WOULDN'T THEY WANT THAT?
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?
>> NOW, METLIFE MUST INCREASEITS CUSHION OF CAPITAL AGAINST
LOSSES.
>> THEY DON'T WANT TO BE FORCEDTO HOLD EXTRA CAPITAL, WHICH
BRINGS DOWN THEIR PROFITS.>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  AH.
SO BASICALLY, THE GOVERNMENT ISSAYING TO METLIFE, I KNOW YOU
THINK EVERYTHING'S FINE, BUTEXTRA CAPITAL WOULD PROVIDE YOU
SOME -- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKINGFOR -- A CUSHION, A SAFEGUARD?
INSURANCE.
( LAUGHTER )BECAUSE AS A WISE, BALD,
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD FAILED FOOTBALLKICKER ONCE SAID TO ME WHEN HE
WAS TRYING TO GET ME TO BUYSOMETHING -- WELL, WHY DON'T I
LET HIM TELL YOU.
>> I NEVER REALIZED THE WORLDWAS SO FULL OF HAZARDS.
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A COMPANYLIKE MET LIFE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES
THINGS DO GET OUT OF CONTROL.
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD GET MET.
IT PAYS.
>> Jon:  WAH-WAH-WAH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
