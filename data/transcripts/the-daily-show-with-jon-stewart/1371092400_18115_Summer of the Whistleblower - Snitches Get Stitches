IT'S MEAN TO MAKE FUN OF
PEOPLE'S APPEARANCE.
STILL, I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THE
IMPULSE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON
EDWARD SNOWDEN.
IT'S EASIER TO HAVE AN OPINION
ON A PERSON RATHER THAN ON AN
EXTREMELY COMPLICATED ISSUE.
WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR
INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT
SAMANTHA BEE AT INTELLIGENCE
HEADQUARTERS.
>> HELLO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, JOHN?
>> John: WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE
ON EDWARD SNOWEDEN?
HEROIC TRUTH TELLER OR WEASELY
TRAITOR?
>> WELL, DID SNOWDEN SNITCH ON
YOU?
>> John: NO.
>> THEN HE'S A WHISTLE-BLOWER.
>> John: WHAT IF HE HAD BLOWN
THE WHISTLE ON ME.
>> OH, WELL, THEN HE'D BE A
SNITCH.
>> John: SO IT'S REALLY JUST A
QUESTION OF SEMANTICS.
>> NO, NO, JOHN.
WHISTLE-BLOWERS ENJOY A
PRIVILEGED STATUS.
THEY GET LEGAL TRIALS,
HIGH-PROFILE MEDIA COVERAGE,
ADORING FANS.
>> John: AND WHAT DO SNITCHES
GET.
>> DON'T YOU KNOW?
(LAUGHS)
SNITCHES GET STITCHES.
(APPLAUSE)
>> John: I'VE NOT SEEN THAT SIDE
OF YOUR PERSONALITY BEFORE, SAM.
>> IT'S THERE.
THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE EVER
THINKS THEY'RE A SNITCH.
EVERYONE WITH A CAMERA PHONE
THINKS THEY'RE A HERO SHEDDING
LIGHT ON INJUSTICE EVEN IF THAT
INJUSTICE IS HAVING TO PAY FOR A
COOLATTA.
>> I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT AND
NITI FORGOT TO GIVE ME A
RECEIPT.
THIS IS BEING ROHR RECORDED ON
FACEBOOK.
I'M GOING TO GET A MILLION
(BLEEP)ING HITS.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME MY WATER OR
MY COOLATTA.
THIS IS ABOUT TO GO LIVE BITCH,
RIGHT ON FACEBOOK.
SO I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR
LITTLE SAND (BLEEP) SELF.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> John: HOLY (BLEEP)
>> OH, YEAH.
>> John: SHE JUST WENT FROM
SPOILED CONSUMER TO RACIST
MONSTER IN LESS THAN 20 SECONDS.
WOULD THIS WOMAN BE CONSIDERED A
WHISTLE-BLOWER OR A SNITCH?
>> NO, SHE'S WHAT'S KNOWN IN
INTELLIGENCE CIRCLES AS A
(BLEEP).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> John: IS THAT AN ACRONYM?
(LAUGHTER)
>> UM -- YEAH, SURE IT IS.
>> John: THANK YOU, SAM.
