SO THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WEHAVE IS COMPLETELY LACKING IN
PURPOSE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S SIMPLY ACCRETION OFWELL-MEANING LAWS AND
REGULATIONS BY ANONYMOUS PEOPLETHAT HAVE PILED UP, AND THEN YOU
ASK YOURSELF, WHO ISRESPONSIBLE?
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THISBUDGET DEBT?
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FACT WECAN'T REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE?
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OFTHIS STUFF?
NOBODY.
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU AQUESTION.
AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO HEARSMUSIC, OR ARE YOU HEARING THAT,
TOO?
>> I LOVE MUSIC.
>> Jon: AM I WRONG?
IS THERE MUSIC PLAYING SOMEWHERETHERE YOU GO.
OKAY. JUST FOR A SECOND, ALL OF
SUDDEN, AS YOU WERE TALKING,I'M LIKE, HOLY SHIT, WE'RE IN A
MOVIE NOW. LIKE, I HEARD THEMUSIC WAS PLAYING, AND I WAS
LIKE, AS YOU WERE TALKING,I'M LIKE, WE'RE GETTING TO
THE BIG CLIMAX OF THE SCENE.THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
SO IT IS NOT NECESSARILYPURPOSEFUL. BUT LET ME ASK YOU,
DOESN'T THE COMPLEXITY OF MUCHOF THIS, ISN'T THAT PURPOSEFUL
BECAUSE IT FAVORS LARGERENTITIES THAT CAN, YOU KNOW,
THE VOLCKER RULE DIDN'TBECOME 900 PAGES BY ENTROPY.
PEOPLE WENT IN AND COMPLEXED ITUP.
THE ACCRETION WAS PURPOSEFULAND IT WAS DONE BY BUSINESS
INTERESTS THAT WERE TRYING TOCAUSE A SLOWDOWN AND A GUMMING
UP OF THE WORKS.
>> EACH PIECE OF THE ACCRETIONIS SUPPORTED BY SOMEBODY.
IT CAN BE AN INTEREST GROUP,PUBLIC UNION, CORPORATE
INTERESTS, EVERYBODY.VOLCKER RULE WAS ALL ABOUT
BUSINESS LOBBYISTS TRYING TOMICROMANAGE
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODYTO MAKE A DECISION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY WANTED TO MICROMANAGEIT.
SO, THAT'S WHAT LOBBYISTS DO INWASHINGTON APPARENTLY.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLESYSTEM, IT'S NOT PURPOSEFUL,
IT'S JUST A LOT OF THOSEACCUMULATIONS.
IF YOU TRY CHANGE ANYTHING, THISIS WHERE THE FOUNDERS MADE A
MISTAKE, THEY DIDN'T REALIZETHAT EACH ONE OF THESE
LITTLE LAWS AND RULESIMMEDIATELY WOULD BE SUPPORTED,
SURROUNDED BY AN ARMYOF SPECIAL INTERESTS.
SO IF YOU TRY CHANGE SOMETHING,HEAVEN HELP YOU.
THEY'LL GO NUTS SENDING MONEY TOYOUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS,
WHATEVER.
AND SO PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP.
SO YOU HAVE THIS SYSTEM THAT ISLITERALLY ENTRENCHED, AND I
ACTUALLY THINK, WELL, WE NEED AREFRAMING, A RESET BUTTON.
WE NEED THE RECODIFICATION, BUTWE ALSO NEED GOING FORWARD THE
IDEA THAT EVERY LAW HAS
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES,EVERY LIFE CHOICE --
>> Jon: EVERYTHING WE DO.
>> YEAH. YOU HAVE TO GO BACK ANDADJUST.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU KEEP SAYINGTHE RESET BUTTON, WHAT WOULD
BE THE LEGISLATIVEMECHANISM FOR THAT.
HOW WOULD WE GET THAT?
>> OH, YOU CAN DO IT WITH A VERYSIMPLE LAW.
I BELIEVE IN SIMPLE LAWS.
A SIMPLE LAW THAT SAYS YOU'REGOING TO BE A SPECIAL COMMISSION
SET UP IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWINGAREAS.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A YEAR.
HERE'S HOW IT WILL BE APPOINTED,SMALL, NOT BIG, LIKE THE SIMPSON
BOWLES.
THEY HAVE A YEAR TO COME BACKWITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO
RESET PRIORITIES AND RESTOREMANAGEABILITY TO THIS REGULATORY
PROGRAM.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> THEN THEY COME BACK AND MAKEA PROPOSAL AND CONGRESS VOTES ON
IT.
>> Jon: THAT SOUNDS SIMPLEENOUGH. LET ME JUST MAKE ONE
QUICK CHANGE TO IT, THOUGH,BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT. OK, SO
THERE SHOULD BE TWO DEMOCRATSAND TWO REPUBLICANS, BUT I DO
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ANINDEPENDENT AND I DO THINK THE
TEA PARTY SHOULD BE REPRESENTED.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, TOOACTUALLY, THE COMMITTEE... LET'S
MAKE THE COMMITTEE 10.
I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT FAIRER.
SIX I THOUGHT WAS A LITTLE...
LET'S MAKE IT 11.
IT SHOULD BE ALSO GEOGRAPHICALLYREPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE SIX IS
HARD TO PULL IN.
>> RIGHT, NOW WELCOME TO THEPROCESS.
WELCOME TO THE PROCESS.
>> Jon: YES.>> NONETHELESS, YOU DO YOU
HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES, ANDSOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE A
HYPOTHESIS, TRY TO GET PEOPLEA MORAL AUTHORITY.
>> Jon: MORAL AUTHORITY IS THEKEY. THAT IS THE KEY.
AND, THAT'S THE THING THATI FEEL LIKE WE HAVE LOST.
THE IDEA OF CAPABLE PEOPLEMAKING DECISIONS AND THEN BEING
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE DECISIONSSEEMS TO BE LOST.
THAT IDEA THAT THAT'S ELITIST,IT'S LIKE ANYTHING THAT
EXERCISES EDITORIAL AUTHORITYIS ELITIST AND UNDEMOCRATIC AND
NOT THE WAY WE DO THINGS AROUNDHERE.
AND IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVE LOSTTHAT IDEA OF MAKING CHOICES AND
DEALING WITH THOSE CONSEQUENCESBASED ON EVIDENCE AND OTHER
TYPES OF MINDY THINGS.
[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]
THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THATANYMORE.
>> WE HAVE LOST THE CORE IDEAUNDERLYING DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS
HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY THAT'SACCOUNTABILITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. LET'S GET ITBACK.
PHILIP K. HOWARD!
PHILIP K. HOWARD!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
