[LAUGHTER]
HOW ABOUT THAT AS AN ANSWER?
SO ANYWAY, I'M BACK.
I'M READY FOR ACTION.
I'M VERY EXCITED.
YOU KNOW, IN ALL THE EXCITEMENT
OVER A CERTAIN CONGRESSMAN'S
EXCITEMENT, WE MAY MAY HAVE LOST
TRACK OF SOME OF THE OTHER
PRESSING ISSUES OF THE DAY,
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, THE ECONOMY.
I WONDER HOW THAT'S GOING.
>> THE VERY DISAPPOINTING JOBS
REPORT.
EMPLOYERS ADDED JUST 54,000
WORKERS TO THEIR PAYROLLS IN
MAY.
>> THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WENT UP
TO 9.1%.
>> NEW FACTORY ORDERS FELL TO
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN TWO YEARS.
>> HOME PRICES AT THEIR LOWEST
LEVEL SINCE 2002.
>> Jon: SEASHELLS ARE NOW
CONSIDERED MONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
HOTCAKES SELLING LIKE CAKES THAT
HAVED NOT BEEN HEATED IN ANY
WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
HOLY CRAP.
IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE THAT
REALLY MAKE ME HAPPY THAT THERE
IS A PRODUCT OUT THERE AS
DELICIOUS, NUTRITIOUS AND
SUSPICIOUSLY AFFORDABLE AS JON
STEWART'S SEMI-DIGESTABLE WONDER
PASTE.
[LAUGHTER]
WOW.
JON STEWART'S SEMI-DIGESTIBLE
WONDER PASTE --
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
MMHM.
WOW.
WOW.
THAT WAS IN MY MOUTH.
[LAUGHTER]
EVERY JAR OF JON STEWART'S
SEMI-DIGESTIBLE WONDER PASTE IS
NOW GUARANTEED NOT TO CONTAIN
ANY PETS THAT YOU PERSONALLY
KNEW.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I GUARANTEE THERE'S NOT
HAMSTERS, PAROTS, HORSES, CATS
OR DOGS.
>> Jon: WOW.
WHO'S GOING TO STITCH MY MOUTH
UP?
THAT WAS ONE DEPRESSING LITANY
OF MISERABLE ECONOMIC NEWS.
IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACKDROP
THAT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WENT
TO A CHRYSLER FACTORY, STRAPPED
ON THE GOGGLES AND OFFERED A
CONGRATULATORY HANDSHAKE TO THE
FEW REMAINING PEOPLE IN THE
COUNTRY WHO STILL HAVE JOBS.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE HE DELIVERED HIS STATE OF
THE ECONOMY ADDRESS.
>> WE STILL FACE SOME TOUGH
TIMES.
WE STILL FACE SOME CHALLENGES.
WE'RE GOING TO PASS THROUGH SOME
ROUGH TERRAIN.
THERE'S STILL SOME HEADWINDS
THAT ARE COMING AT US.
>> Jon: NO [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
A LITTLE ROUGH TERRAIN, A LITTLE
HEADWINDS STILL COMING AT US IS
FINE.
WE'RE AMERICANS.
WE'RE STRONG.
>> JUST LIKE IF YOU HAD A BAD
ILLNESS, IF YOU GOT HIT BY A
TRUCK, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO
TAKE A WHILE FOR YOU TO MEND,
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED TO
OUR ECONOMY.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HOW DID WE GO FROM
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF
HEADWINDS TO WE GOT HIT BY A
TRUCK?
NOT EVEN A CAR.
WE GOT HIT BY A TRUCK.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO GET HIT BY
TRUCKS, THEY DON'T BOUNCE BACK.
THEY DON'T USUALLY LIVE.
AND THE ONES WHO DO LIVE,
WINDING UP WRITING ABOUT IT WITH
THEIR FEET.
ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING
ASPECTS OF THE FAILING ECONOMY
IS THAT IT'S NOT FAILING
EQUALLY.
>> IT HAS HIT THE AFRICAN
AMERICAN COMMUNITY MORE THAN
MOST GROUPS.
>> Jon: I KNEW IT, AFRICAN
AMERICANS.
WESLEY SNIPES WAS RIGHT, ALWAYS
BET ON BLACK AND DON'T PAY YOUR
TAXES.
