WHAT IS IT LIKE TO LIVE IN THATWORLD OF PURE FEAR AND DESPAIR
WHERE EVERY INCONSEQUENTIALCHANGE IN WHAT WAS BECOMES A
CHHARBINGER OF DYSTOPIAN POSTAMERICA APOCALYPSE WHERE
ONLY MUSLIMS CAN SWIM AND THESIDEWALK GAME WHERE DECENT LAW
ABIDING WHITE FOLK ARE RANDOMLYKNOCKED OUT HAS REPLACED
BASEBALL AS OUR NATIONALPASTTIME.
>> A NEW BATTLE IN THE WAR ONCHRISTMAS.
>> THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
>> THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THATIS SAYING FAITH BASED TUNES HAVE
NO PLACE IN THE ELEMENTARYSCHOOL.
>> THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANSCELEBRATE CHRISTMAS SO EVERYBODY
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENJOYTHE SEASON WITHOUT THE
INTERFERENCE OF A FEW BAH HUMBUGBULLIES.
>> Jon: HOW CAN I ENJOY MYCHRISTMAS WHEN I KNOW SOMEWHERE
A LITTLE JEWISHBOY ISN'T FORCED TO SING OH,
LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM.
>> SARAH PALIN HAS A NEW BOOKOUT ABOUT THE MEANING OF
CHRISTMAS.
[LAUGHTER][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I WAS HOPING FOR BLITZENBUT SHE'LL DO.
>> CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHYSOMEBODY
WHO IS NOT A CHRISTIAN WOULDFEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH AULD
DEMONSTRATION OFSOMETHING FROM THE BIBLE FROM
THE NEW TESTAMENT.
COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENTBECAUSE TO THEM IT MIGHT FEEL
LIKE THE GOVERNMENT IS PICKING ARELIGION AND IT'S NOT THEIRS.
>> WELL, THERE'S THINGS WE CANDO ABOUT THAT TO I GUESS LESSEN
THAT OFFENSE.
WE CAN DO THAT IN OUR PERSONALLIVES.
IN MY FAMILY WE HAVE THE MENORAHOUT THROUGH DECEMBER ON OUR
KITCHEN TABLE.
I WANT TO TEACH MY CHILDRENABOUT THE JEWISH FAITH.
>> Jon: QUICK WORD TO THEPALIN KIDS, WHILE I APPRECIATE
THE GESTURE, JEWS DON'T ACTUALLYJUST LEAVE A MENORAH OUT FOR THE
MONTH OF DECEMBER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]LIKE A KNICKKNACK IN A CURIO
CASE.
GOES IN THE WINDOW AND ONLY PUTIT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.
PALIN KIDS THIS IS NOT AMENORAH.
NOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONEWHO CAN DEFEND CHRISTMAS WITH A
LITTLE MORE AUTHORITY.
OVER THE YEARS WE'VE TAKEN ONTHE ROLE OF PROTECTING THE
FEDERAL HOLIDAY OF CHRISTMAS.
>> Jon: EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT INANY WAY THREATENED.
I'LL BITE.
TELL ME WHY THIS YEAR IT'SESPECIALLY EGREGIOUS TO USE THE
PHRASE HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
>> WHAT IS INTERESTING THIS YEARIS HANUKKAH IS OVER ON THURSDAY
SO THERE ARE NO MORE HOLIDAYSBETWEEN THEN AND CHRISTMAS DAY.
>> Jon: DAMN YOU, O'REILLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]WE'VE BEEN CHECKMATED.
WITHOUT HANUKKAH WE HAVE NOEXCUSE TO SAY
HAPPY HOLIDAYS PLURAL BECAUSEAPPARENTLY YOU  CAN'T INCLUDE
ANYTHING PAST CHRISTMAS LIKEKWANZAA AND NEW YEARS.
BUT THAT MEANS UP UNTIL HANUKKAHYOU CAN ONLY SAY HAPPY HANUKKAH
BUT WHAT THE (bleep) CARESBABOUT THAT. WHO ELSE IS PEEING
ONYOUR YULE LOG THIS YEAR?
>> MACY'S A COMPANY I GENERALLYLIKE.
>> Jon: MACY'S ISN'TCHRISTMASSY ENOUGH FOR YOU?
THIS MACY'S?
THE ONE EMBLAZONED WITH ABEJEWELED BELIEVE SIGN THAT
COULD BE SEEN FROM SPACE?
[LAUGHTER]THE ONE THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH
SOMEONE EJACULATED TINSEL ALLOVER IT?
THAT MACY'S?
[LAUGHTER][ APPLAUSE ]
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?
>> THIS YEAR THEY ARE TOUTINGSANTA CLAUS WHO WILL HELP YOU
QUOTE "WITH YOUR HOLIDAY WISHLIST."
SO HERE IS MY QUESTION TO MACY'SWHAT HOLIDAY IS SANTA
CELEBRATING?
>> Jon: THAT ISA GOOD
QUESTION.
HE IS CELEBRATING THE FEASTOF ST. NICHOLAS WHICH
ORIGINATED IN THE NETHERLANDSAND OCCURS EVERY DECEMBER 6.
YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD ABOUTTHAT BECAUSE EVERY OTHER HOLIDAY
IS SUCKED INTO THE BLACK HOLETHAT IS CHRISTMAS.
BY THE WAY, YOU ARE UPSET WITH ADEPARTMENT STORE BECAUSE IN
THEIR EFFORT TO GET TO YOU BUYTHE HELLO KITTY FIGURINE THEY
ARE NOT INVOKING CHRIST'S NAMEENOUGH.
I THOUGHT CHRISTIANS USED TO COMPLAIN THAT THEIR HOLIDAY WAS
GETTING TOO COMMERCIALIZED. >> I LOVE THE COMMERCIALIZATION
OF CHRISTMAS BECAUSE IT SPREADSTHE CHEER.
IT'S THE MOST JOLLY HOLIDAY ONTHE CALENDAR.
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY.
COMMERCIALIZATION IS SPREADINGCHRISTMAS CHEER.
I HAVE BEEN CONFUSED ABOUT THEHOLIDAY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT OPENINGONES HOME TO FRIENDS NOT OPENING
A PRESENT AND RETURNING IT FORCREDIT. IF THE TRUE SPIRIT OFR
CHRISTMAS IS BEST SPREAD ANDEXPRESSED THROUGH COMMERCIALISM
AND MATERIALISM, THENANYONE WHO DENOUNCES THOSE
THINGS IS WAGING WAR ONCHRISTMAS, SARAH PALIN, BILL
O'REILLY MEET YOUR NEWESTNEMESIS.
>> TODAY POPE FRANCIS DENOUNCES TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS AS UNFAIR
TO THE POOR.
>> CALLING FOR CATHOLICS TORESIST EXCESSIVE CAPITALISM AND
MATERIALISM.
>> Jon: WHEN WILL THE POPESTOP HIS WAR ON CHRISTMAS?
[LAUGHTER][ APPLAUSE ]
WELL, I HOPE HIS MESSAGE ISHEARD AND SOME DAY MACY'S WILL
TRULY HONOR THE SPIRIT OFCHRISTMAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
