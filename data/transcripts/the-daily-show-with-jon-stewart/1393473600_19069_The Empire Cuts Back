[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES
MAY NOT HAVE WON THE MOST MEDALSAT THIS YEAR'S OLYMPICS.
THERE'S ONE EVENT THAT WE'LLNEVER BE SECOND BEST.
FIGHTING (bleep).
THE UNITED STATES HAS THEGREATEST MILITARY ON THIS
PLANET.
WE LEAD THE WORLD IN SMART BOMBSAND INCREASINGLY STUPID CHILDREN
BUT STILL.
[LAUGHTER]WE'RE ABOUT TO FIX THAT.
THE BOMBS PART.
[ LAUGHTER ]KIDS ARE KIND OF A LOST CAUSE.
>> AFTER 13 YEARS OF WARFARE FORTHIS COUNTRY, THE U.S. NOW HAS A
NEW DEFENSE BATTLE PLAN THATINVOLVES SHRINKING DOWN THE
MILITARY.
>> THE SPENDING PLAN
WOULD SHRINK THE ARMYTO ITS SMALLEST SIZE SINCE THE1930'S BEFORE
WORLD WAR II.
>> Jon: WHAT?
I JUST LOVE THE ARMY.
I JUST LOVE THE ARMY.
[LAUGHTER]WE CAN'T SHRINK THE ARMY.
IT'S A PROCESS THAT'S ONLY BEENTESTED ON OUR KIDS.
[LAUGHTER]AND THEN AFTER THAT OURSELVES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IS THIS GOING TO BE A TRILOGY?
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE CUTTING?
>> AFTER IRAQ AND AFGHANISTANWE'RE NO LONGER SIZING THE
MILITARY TO CONDUCT LONGSTABILITY OPERATIONS.
THODAY THERE'S 520,000 ACTIVEDUTY SOLDIERS.
WE'VE DECIDED TO FURTHER REDUCETHE ACTIVE DUTY ARMY STRENGTH TO
A RANGE OF 440,000 TO 450SOLDIERS.
>> Jon: 450 THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I REALLY DON'T -- 450,000.
THAT'S --[LAUGHTER]
THAT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE FINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO WE'RE DEPLOYING TOUGH LOVE TO
MATCH OUR MILITARY SIZE TO OURMILITARY NEEDS.
I THINK THIS IS RIGHT ESPECIALLYSINCE OUR MILITARY SPENDING IS
BIGGER THAN THE NEXT 13COUNTRIES COMBINED.
AS LONG AS WE KEEP THECOMMITMENTS WE'VE ALREADY MADE
TO OUR VETERANS I THINK THAT WEHAVE TO -- I KNOW THAT NOISE.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THAT CAN'T BE DICK CHENEY.
YES!
HE WHO LIVES IN THE SHADOWS ANDFEEDS OFF THE DARKNESS THE ONE
WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED ALTHOUGH INAMED HIM.
>> I'VE NOT BEEN A STRONGSUPPORTER OF BARACK OBAMA BUT
THIS REALLY IS OVER THE TOP.
THERE'S ENORMOUS LONG TERMDAMAGE TO THE MILITARY. THEY
ARE BASICALLY MAKING THEDECISION, THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, THAT THEY NOLONGER WANT TO BE DOMINANT ON
THE SEAS AND THE SKY AND INSPACE AND THEIR BUDGET REFLECTS
THAT.
>> Jon: YES, YES THE COMMANDERIN CHIEF AND THE SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE WANT THE U.S. TO BE WEAKAND DEFENSELESS BECAUSE ONLYTHEN CAN THE CHINESE
COME IN, ROLL US OVER ON OURBELLIES, AND TICKLE US TIL OURLEG SHAKES. YOU'D BETTER HAVE ABETTER ARGUMENT THAN THAT.
>> HE'D RATHER SPEND THEMONEY ON FOOD STAMPS THAN HEWOULD ON A
STRONG MILITARY OR SUPPORT FORTHE TROOPS.
>> Jon: WHO USES FOOD STAMPS ABUNCH OF WEAK, MOOCHER CLASSDEAD
BEATS.
PROBABLY NEVER WORKED A DAY INTHEIR LIVES.
>> A LOT OF FOOD STAMPS GO TOMILITARY FAMILIES.
MILITARY FAMILIES MORE RELIANTON FOOD STAMPS IN 2013 THAN ANYPREVIOUS YEAR.
OVER 100 MILLION IN FOOD STAMPSAT MILITARY GROCERY STORES.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: SHREWD MOVE, OBAMA
TAKING FOOD OUT OF MOUTHS OF MENAND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND PUTTING
IT BACK IN THEIR MOUTHS.
BUT HERE IS WHERE AMERICA'S BESTKNOWN DICK REALLY MAKES HIS
MARK.
>> THE WHOLE THING IS NOT DRIVENBY ANY CHANGE IN WORLD
CIRCUMSTANCE IT'S DRIVEN BYBUDGET CONSIDERATION.
>> Jon: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOUMAKE DICK DICK CHENEY THE
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THERE'S NOWAY HE WOULD LET SOME [BLEEP]BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FORCE HIM TO
CUT THE TROOP COUNT BY THE5.9% PROPOSED.
>> THE BUDGET WE SUBMITTED TOCONGRESS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
CALLS FOR APPROXIMATELY A 25%REDUCTION IN FORCE STRUCTURE
BETWEEN NOW AND 1995 AND 1996.
>> Jon: YEAH, BECAUSE YOUWOULD HAVE TO CUT 25% TROOPS
BECAUSE 5.9% CUTS IS FORPUSSIES.
SO WHEN YOU WERE IN THEPENTAGON, DICK CHENEY, YOU MADEMUCH
GREATER CUTS THAN THEY AREMAKING NOW.
WHAT WAS YOUR REASONING FOR THATAGAIN?
>> WE REDUCED FORCESDELIBERATELY BASED ON CONTINUING
REEVALUTATIONS OF THE STRATEGICENVIRONMENT.
BOTTOM LINE IS THE ONLY WAYI KNOW TO CUT BUDGET IS TO CUTTHE BUDGET.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT NEVERCHANGES ABOUT DICK CHENEY?
HE IS A BIGGER HYPOCRITE THANTHE NEXT 13 HYPOCRITES COMBINED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
