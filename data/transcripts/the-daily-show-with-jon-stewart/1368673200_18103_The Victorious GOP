>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY
GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FORMER SENATOR
OLYMPIA SNOWE IS GOING TO BE
JOINING US.
FUN FACT.
THEY IS MARRIED TO '90s RAP
SENSATION SNOW.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT.
HURRICANE SANDY, THE CONTINUING
TROPICAL [BLEEP] STORM THAT IS
ROCKING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
YESTERDAY PRESS SECRETARY JAY
CARNEY, LIKE AN INTREPID WEATHER
CHANNEL ANCHOR, STOOD AND LET
THE WIND AND RAIN PUMMEL HIM FOR
OUR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES.
>> ON THE I.R.S., DID THE
PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE
BEING TRUTHFUL?
DOES HE THINK THAT THE
LEADERSHIP THERE NEEDS TO
CHANGE?
>> PART OF IT IS FACT.
IT'S NOT AN IF ANYMORE.
IT'S FACT.
>> THAT'S YOUR OPINION, ALL
RIGHT.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN TWICE AS MANY
PROSECUTIONS AS ALL PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATIONS COMBINED.
>> IS THERE A SIEGE MENTALITY
BACK ON THE WEST WING RIGHT NOW.
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Jon: SIEGE MENTALITY.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
IS IT THE VAT OF BOILING OIL IN
THE MOAT?
IS THAT WHY YOU SAY THAT.
THE VAT OF BOILING OIL.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO KNOWS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FAIR IS FAIR.
IT IS A GOOD WEEK FOR
CONSERVATIVES.
ANGRY RHETORIC, A LEVEL OF UPSET
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT FOR ONCE
SEEMS SOMEWHAT APPROPRIATE.
>> IT CUTS TO THIS
ADMINISTRATION'S CORE
CREDIBILITY.
IT CUTS TO ITS TRUST.
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.
THIS IS DISTURBING.
JUST SHOCKING TO ME.
UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS VERY BAD NEWS FOR THE
WHITE HOUSE.
>> Jon: WHAT THEY JUST SAID
WAS... HANNITY, TUCKER CARLSON
AND DUCEY ARE (MUMBLING).
YOU SEE, WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
THEIR COMPLAINTS HAD SOME
LEGITIMACY.
ALTHOUGH MR. DOOCY I CAN GO
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOUR O-FACE
IS.
( APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH
WEEK FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T JUST THE
INTENSITY OF THE CRITICISM.
IT WASN'T JUST THE INTENSITY OF
THE CRITICISM OF THE WHITE HOUSE
THAT SEEMED APPROPRIATE BUT AT
TIMES THE CONTENT OF THE
CRITICISM.
>> NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE
SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT THE I.R.S.,
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
ON THE HEELS OF HILLARY CLINTON
SAYING I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THOSE EXTRA REQUESTS FOR
SECURITY IN BENGHAZI LIBYA.
WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT
ANYTHING THAT MATTERS?
IS THERE ANYBODY WHO IS MINDING
THE SHOP?
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING
YESTERDAY.
YOU KNOW, MEG AND KELLY, WE'VE
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES.
MAYBE IT'S TIME WE DO A SHOW
TOGETHER.
CALL IT FOX AND FRENEMY.
BEAUTY AND THE BRIS.
WHAT?
I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING TOLD THIS IS GOING TO
BE CALLED REGIS AND KELLY.
ALL RIGHT.
IT HAS GOTTEN SO BAD FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION, SOME ON THE
RIGHT WERE ALMOST OFFERING MORE
SYMPATHETIC RATIONALES FOR THEM.
>> I THINK THEY ALSO HAVE
TERRIBLE WHAT I CALL
SCANDAL-DAR, LIKE RADAR.
IF YOU CUT ME OPEN, I HAVE SO
MUCH SCANDAL-DAR
>> Jon: WHAT DANA PERINO WAS
SAYING IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE WHEN
SOMETHING IS PERCEIVED AS
CORRUPT OR SCANDALOUS IN THE
PUBLIC'S EYE.
ALTHOUGH SCANDAL-DAR IS NOT HOW
YOU WOULD TYPICALLY PHRASE THAT.
IT'S NOT YOU CAN'T JUST ADD THE
SUFFICIENT TICKS-DAR TO
SOMETHING.
IT'S A MORE FINESSE WORD PLAY.
WHAT MAKES GAY-DAR WORK IS GAY,
RHYMES WITH RAY.
SO, FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU HAD A
WEIRD SIXTH SENSE ABOUT WHERE
CHURCHES WERE, YOU COULD SAY
THAT'S PRAYER-DAR.
THAT WOULD WORK OR FOR SOME
REASON YOU ALWAYS DO "WHEN THIS
MONTH STARTED" THAT WOULD BE
MAY-DAR.
TOUPEE-DAR.
THAT WOULD WORK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HE'S LITERALLY... THAT WAS JUST
AN ENORMOUSLY LONG WALK JUST TO
[BLEEP] ON THAT GUY.
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT TO
THAT BIT AT ALL.
I'LL BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH
YOU.
I WORKED UTTERLY BACKWARDS ON
THAT BIT.
THE DANA PERINO BIT.
NOTHING TO THAT.
WE JUST THOUGHT WHAT A NICE WAY
TO GET INTO [BLEEP] DONALD
TRUMP.
THAT'S ALL THAT WAS.
THAT'S IT.
