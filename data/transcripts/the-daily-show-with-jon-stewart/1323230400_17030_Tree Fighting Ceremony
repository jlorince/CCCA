>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
HOW MANY PEOPLE GET THIS WHEN
THEY GO TO WORK, REALLY?
I DON'T EVEN GET THIS WHEN I GO
HOME.
I NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY GO AND
WARM UP MY FAMILY FOR WHEN I GET
HOME.
WHEN I GET HOME "DAD!"
MY GUEST TONIGHT, JONAH HILL.
FRIENDS... FRIENDS-- AND I SAY
THAT NOT REALLY BEING ABLE TO
SEE WHO'S WATCHING-- FRIEND,
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN.
HOLIDAY MAGIC.
THE TWINNING OF LIGHTS, THE
NOTHING OF EGGS AND, OF COURSE,
ANGER AND BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.
>> RHODE ISLAND GOVERNOR LINCOLN
CHAFEE COMING UNDER FIRE AFTER
REFUSING TO CALL THE TREE IN THE
RHODE ISLAND STATEHOUSE A
CHRISTMAS TREE.
>> Jon: HE INSISTS PEOPLE CALL
IT THE DEVIL'S PINE!
(LAUGHTER)
SATAN'S SPRUCE!
A TREE BORTION.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S FOX'S WAR ON CHRISTMAS!
IT'S BACK, BABY.
AND THIS YEAR'S DESIGNATED
KROOJ, RHODE ISLAND GOVERNOR AND
PART TIME STEVE DOOCY
IMPERSONATOR...
(LAUGHTER).
LINCOLN CHAFEE.
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO CHAFEE HAD
THE AUDACITY TO INVITE AMERICANS
TO A "TREE LIGHTING."
OR, JUDGING BY THE REACTION, A
JESUS TIPPING.
>> IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE.
KEEP CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS.
>> FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING
RIGHT NOW AND THINKING THAT'S
CRAY SHIRKS I SHOULD CALL THE
GOVERNOR.
WE'VE GOT HIS PHONE NUMBER.
>> IT HAS LIGHTS AND ORNAMENTS
AND A DECORATION ON TOP, IT'S A
CHRISTMAS TREE.
>> FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS
BEFORE THIS GOVERNOR, YOUR
FORMER GOVERNOR IN FACT DID CALL
IT A CHRISTMAS TREE, RIGHT?
>> HE DID, GRETCHEN.
>> Jon: YES, AND WHILE THAT'S
NOT TRUE...
(LAUGHTER).
WHO CARES?
IT MAKES THEM ANGRY.
SEE, THE PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN
GOVERNOR'S 2009 INVITATION TO
THIS VERY SAME CEREMONY ALSO
USES THE OFFENDING PHRASE
"HOLIDAY TREE LIGHTING!"
I MEAN, SOMEHOW THAT NOT AKIN TO
WIPING YOUR ASS WITH THE SHROUD
OF TURIN?
I MEAN, REALLY.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION,
OBVIOUSLY.
NOW, WHO CARES IF THE STORY IS
TRUE OR WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS?
THE IMPORTANT THING IS IS TO
ALLOW THIS HEATHEN GOVERNOR TO
DEFILE A SACRED RITUAL... RITUAL
RITUAL.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS
COMBINING THAT WORD WITH.
TO ALLOW HIM TO DEFILE A SACRED
RITUAL.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S TO IMPERIL OUR NATION'S
VERY FOUNDING PRINCIPLES.
>> WHY DO THESE PILGRIMS BRAVE
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS
TO LIVE HERE, DIE HERE, AND TO
TRY TO START A NEW WAY OF LIFE
FOR THEPTSES?
>> RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR
EVERYONE.
>> RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
>> AND NOW IT'S ON THE ROCKS.
>> Jon: YES.
YES, LADY WEARING CROSS ON
TELEVISION.
(LAUGHTER)
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS ON THE
ROCKS!
THE ROCKS!
OF COURSE, NOT AS ON THE ROCKS
AS IT WAS IN THE 17th
CENTURY WHEN YOUR FRIENDS THE
PILGRIMS OUTLAWED CHRISTMAS
CELEBRATIONS AS A SACRILEGE AND
DECLARED GIFTS AND CHRISTMAS
DECORATIONS SATAN CAL, LEVYING A
FIVE-SHILLING FINE ON ANYONE FOR
SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS.
FIVE SHILLINGS.
I MEAN, IN THOSE DAYS THAT'S TWO
MILK COWS AND A BUCKLED HAT.
(LAUGHTER)
IF THE PILGRIMS WERE ALIVE
TODAY, THIS IS HOW THEY'D
DECORATE THE TOWN SQUARE.
(LAUGHTER)
OR PERHAPS YOU'D PREFER TO
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS THE WAY OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS DID?
>> ON DECEMBER 25, 1789, THE
UNITED STATES CONGRESS SAT IN
SESSION AND CONTINUED TO STAY
OPEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY FOR MOST
OF THE NEXT 67 YEARS.
>> Jon: HOW'S THAT TASTE,
MOTHER (BLEEP)ERS?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT!
WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED,
CONGRESS HAD EXACTLY THE SAME
ATTITUDE ABOUT THE SANCTITY OF
CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS THAT A
