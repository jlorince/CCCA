( LAUGHTER )
WOW.
BARACK OBAMA IS JUST TERRIBLE.
REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY ARE
COMING DOWN ON HIM MERCILESSLY.
I BET THEY MISS THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN THEY HAD A PRESIDENT
THEY RESPECTED.
>> UNDER CLINTON YOU HAD A
PRESIDENT WILLING TO COMPROMISE.
BILL CLINTON, WHO YOU DEPICT IN
YOUR BOOK, WAS A FLEXIBLE GUY.
>> HE LEARNED HOW THE COMPROMISE
WITH CONSERVATIVES TO GET THINGS
DONE.
>> IF HE'S WILLING TO WORK WITH
US AS BILL CLINTON DID AFTER THE
1994 ELECTIONS TO PASS THINGS
LIKE WELFARE REFORM, TRADE
AGREEMENTS AND THE LIKE, WE'LL
CERTAINLY WORK WITH HIM.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
REPUBLICAN DARLING BILL CLINTON.
( LAUGHTER )
SOME OF YOU MAY BE TOO YOUNG TO
REMEMBER THE FEEL-GOOD 1990s
WHEN A UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED
PRESIDENT CLINTON REIGNED OVER
AN EIGHT-YEAR BIPARTISAN
LOVEFEST.
LET ME GIVE YOU A TEST OF WHAT
IT FELT LIKE BACK THEN.
♪ LET THE SUN SHINE
LET THE SUN SHINE ♪♪
AND BY THE WAY, THAT IS WHAT
THEY WERE SINGING AT HIS
IMPEACHMENT HEARING.
ANYWAY, THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER
IT.
OH, BUT I WAS HIGH FOR NEARLY
THE ENTIRE DECADE.
>> PRESIDENT CLINTON LIED.
>> HE ASSAULTED OUR LEGAL
SYSTEM.
>> DELIVERED AN UNWORKABLE
SOCIALIST HEALTH CARE SCHEME.
>> THE APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE,
THE EXTREMISM.
>> NEW SPENDING AND NEW TAXES.
>> HE WANTS TO MAKE RADICAL
CHANGES.
>> IT'S AN UNAMERICAN POSITION.
>> NEW AGE SOCIALIST.
>> SOMEONE WHO HAS DODGED THE
DRAFT, IS DRAFT DODGER.
>> I ABUSED -- BELIEVE HE ABUSED
HIS FOSTER.
>> THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF VINCE
FOSTER.
>> SUICIDE.
WHY?
WHY?
>> THERE WAS BLONDE HAIR ON HIS
T-SHIRT.
WHOSE HAIR WAS IT?
>> BILL CLINTON IS BAD BOY, A
NAUGHTY BOY.
>> MISLEADING AND UNTRUTHFUL.
>> FAKE AND PHONY.
>> BILL CLINTON IS PROBABLY EVEN
NASTY, BAD, NAUGHTY BOY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: SENATOR AIRPORT RUB
AND TUG IS RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
BILL CLINTON WAS A BIPARTISAN
DREAM WHO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS TRIED IMPEACH WHEN THEY
WEREN'T ON THE FLOOR OF THE
HOWNS ACCUSING HIM OF HAVING
HAND IN SOMEONE'S MURDER.
BUT I GUESS FOR REPUBLICANS,
CLINTON IS LIKE A FINE WINE, THE
MORE YOU DRINK, THE HARDER IT IS
TO REMEMBER, OH, I [BLEEPED]
HATE WINE.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THE '90s
WEREN'T THE LOVEFEST I REMEMBER,
BUT I KNOW THERE WAS A DECADE
THAT WAS.
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE CREDIT TO
PRESIDENT RAGAN, WHO TRIED TO
HAVE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
>> RONALD REAGAN ENGAGED
DIRECTLY AND PERSONALLY WITH
GORBACHEV.
>> RONALD REAGAN, WHO WAS JUST
FIERCE IN HIS COMMENTARY THAT
TORTURE IS ABHORRENT.
>> RONALD REAGAN, WHO DESPITE
HIS AVERSION TO GOVERNMENT WAS
WILLING TO HELP SAVE SOCIAL
SECURITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS,
WORKING WITH DEMOCRATS.
>> YOU HAD THAT.
AND IF TIVO WENT BACK THAT FAR,
WE WOULD SHOW YOU THE MONTAGE
THE PROVE IT.
LET ME RE-ENACT THE '80ED FOR
YOU.
RONALD REAGAN IS AN [BLEEPED]
HOLE, A DICK WAD, A RAVING MAD
CALIFORNIA JELLYBEAN ADDICT.
THE DISTINGUISHED GENERALMAN
FROM CHARACTER VAINA YIELDS HIS
TIME.
>> IT'S BECOMING VERY CLEAR THAT
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN THE
PRESIDENT IS THE PRESIDENT WHO
FOLLOWS HIM.
SO I'VE GOT SOME ADVICE FOR
SOMEONE WHO COULD REALLY USE IT,
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, MEET ME AT
CAMERA THREE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU IGNORANT RACIST MARXIST
THEOCRATIC GODLESS CHICKEN
[BLEEPED].
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW'S THAT TASTE?
YOU, ACCORDING TO THE THINGS
I'VE HEARD MYSELF SAY ABOUT YOU,
ARE THE WORST.
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE WILL COVER
YOUR INAUGURATION.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
WHAT DID AMERICA EVER DO TO YOU?
AND AS I SIT HERE TODAY WATCHING
THE STATE PUFF MARSHMALLOW MAN
RAMPAGING THROUGH THE STREETS OF
MY BELOVED CITY, ONE THING HAS
POPPED INTO MY HEAD -- NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF A THOUGHTFUL
UNITER LIKE GEORGE W. BUSH.
( LAUGHTER )
WOW, HISTORY DOES JUDGE YOU
DIFFERENTLY.
BECAUSE APPARENTLY EVERY FOUR
YEARS HISTORY HAS A PIANO
