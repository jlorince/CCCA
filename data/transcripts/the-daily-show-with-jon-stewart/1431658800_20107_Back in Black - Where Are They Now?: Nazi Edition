>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
WHEN A STORY FALLS THROUGH THECRACKS, LEWIS BLACK CATCHES IT
IN A SEGMENT WE CALL"BACK IN BLACK."
>> LAST WEEK MARKED THE 70thANNIVERSARY OF OUR VICTORY OVER
NAZI GERMANY.
A MOMENT CAPTURED BY THISICONIC PHOTOGRAPH OF CAPTAIN
AMERICA PUNCHING HITLER IN THEFACE.
THE POINT IS, WE BEAT THE NAZIS.
SO WHY DO WE STILL HAVE THEMGOOSESTEPPING THROUGH OUR NEWS?
>> THE PUBLISHING COMPANY RANDOMHOUSE IS BEING SUED BY THE
ESTATE OF ADOLF HITLER'SPROPAGANDA MINISTER JOSEPH
GOEBBELS.
THE COMPANY WANTS TO PUBLISH ANEW BIOGRAPHY OF GOEBBELS BUT IS
REFUSING TO PAY FOR THE USE OFEXTRACTS FROM HIS DIARIES.
>> FIRST OF ALL, HOW DOES JOSEPHGOEBBELS HAVE AN ESTATE?
I DON'T HAVE AN ESTATE?
I'VE WORKED THE ROAD FOR DECADESBUSTING MY ASS TO ENTERTAIN
AMERICA, AND ALL I HAVE TO SHOWFOR IT IS 10 COUPONS FOR
CHICK-FIL-A AND A PILE OFSTOLEN SKYMALL CATALOGS.
AND WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDCOMES OUT OF ANONYMITY TO GO,
"HEY! IT'S US, THE GIRLS."
PAY US OUR HISTORICAL DUES!
>> WHEN YOUR ORGANIZATION WASCONTACTED BY THE LAW FIRM
REPRESENTING THE FAMILY SAYING,"WE WANT ROYALTIES" WHAT GOES
THROUGH YOUR MIND AT THAT POINT?
>> TO BE HONEST, I THOUGHT THATWAS A JOKE.
>> TO BE FAIR TO HIM, GERMANSHAVE NO IDEA WHAT A JOKE IS.
THEY FIND LAUGHTER INEFFICIENT.
NOW RANDOM HOUSE NEEDS TO LEARNTHAT ANY TIME YOU MIX NAZIS AND
COMMERCE, THINGS GO BAD.
JUST ASK MATTEL, WHICH HAD TOAPOLOGIZE TO THE POLISH
GOVERNMENT FOR REFERRING TOOCCUPIED POLAND AS NAZI POLAND
IN THEIR FUN-FILLED FAMILY CARDGAME "APPLES TO APPLES."
MATTEL FIXED THE TYPO BUT THEYKEPT THE "SCHINDLER'S LIST"
CARD.
THAT'S REAL!
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION WHY ISTHIS APPLE SO DAMN HAPPY ABOUT
"SCHINDLER'S LIST?"WRONG EMOTION, FRUIT!
TOO SOON!
( APPLAUSE )AND-- AND SPEAKING OF TOO SOON,
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT.
>> A FORMER NAZI GUARD ISADMITTING HE FEELS MORAL GUILT
AND IS ASKING FORGIVENESS AT HISTRIAL IN GERMANY.
>> HE'S CHARGED WITH ACCESSORYTO 300,000 MURDERS AT AUSCHWITZ.
>> GROENING IS NOW 93 YEARS OLD.
>> 93?
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THESEWORDS, BUT THAT NAZI LOOKS
GREAT!
( LAUGHTER )NOW, HOW ARE THERE SO MANY
90-YEAR-OLD NAZIS STILL KICKINGAROUND, ANYWAY?
IS RACE HATRED A PRESERVATIVE?
HOLLYWOOD STARS ARE SHOOTINGTHEMSELVES FULL OF BOTOX WHEN
ALL THEY REALLY NEED IS 12 CC'SOF ANTI-SEMITISM.
THOUGH THAT DOESN'T EXPLAEN WHYMEL GIBSON LOOKS LIKE [BLEEP]
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HOW DID THEY FINALLY NAB HIM?
LET ME GUESS.
INTREPID NAZI HUNTERS TRACKEDHIM THROUGH THE AMAZON FOR 40
YEARS.
>> HE SPOKE TO THE BBC, IN ADOCUMENTARY IN 2005, WHERE AGAIN
HE WAS VERY OPEN ABOUT WHATHAPPENED AND THIS IS WHAT HAS
SORT OF INDIRECTLY LED TO THISTRIAL.
>> HE ADMITTED HIS GUILT IN ADOCUMENTARY 10 YEARS AGO?
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS HOW THEYMISSED IT.
NOBODY GETS TO THE DOCUMENTARIESIN THEIR NETFLIX QUEUE.
I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN ABOUTHISTORY, BUT THERE'S A NEW
SEASON OF "HOUSE OF CARDS."
THAT'S MY WEEKEND!
SO THE EVIL ACCOUNTANT ISFINALLY GETTING WHAT HE
DESERVES-- AN EMBARRASSING COURTAPPEARANCE AT THE END OF A LONG,
FULL, UNINCARCERATED LIFE.
AT LEAST HE'LL FINALLY HAVE TOFACE THE PEOPLE HE HURT, AND
THAT'S GOING TO SUCK FOR MIM.
>> AMONG HIS PRISONERS WERE10-YEAR-OLD TWINS EVA AND MIRIAM
MOSES.
TODAY, EVA, THE SURVIVOR, NOWLIVING IN INDIANA, CONFRONTED
GROENING ABOUT WHAT HE KNEW.
>> YES, AT LAST, SWEET, SWEETREVENGE SERVED VERY, VERY COLD.
>> CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT WHAT HEKNEW AND FORGAVE HIM.
>> I DON'T WANT HIM IN JAIL.
HE'S 93 YEARS OLD.
I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT HE HASSOME CONSCIENCE.
>> THAT'S IT?
I GOTTA SAY, THAT WOMAN IS ABETTER PERSON THAN I AM BECAUSE
IF I MET A NAZI WHO HELPED KILLMY FAMILY, I'D TAKE HIS
( BLEEP ) NUT SACK, WRAPPED ITAROUND HIS NECK, PULLED IT
DOWN, SHOVED IT UP HIS ASS, ANDMADE IT COME OUT OF HIS PEE PEE
HOLE, THEN I'D TIE IT INTO THESHAPE OF A STAR OF DAVID LIKE A
BALLOON ANIMAL.
I ALSO DO BAR MITZVAHS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )JON.
>> Jon:  LEWIS BLACK, EVERYBODY.WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
