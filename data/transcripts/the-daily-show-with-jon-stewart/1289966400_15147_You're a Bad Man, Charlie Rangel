OF MY ROCK BAND'S ALBUM.
LA OF LAUGH IT'S THE SECOND FULL
WEEK OF NOVEMBER, EVERYBODY
FOLLOWING THE FIRST TUESDAY OF
NOVEMBER OWE AN EVEN NUMBERED
YEAR.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
THE NEW CONGRESSIONAL FRESHMEN
ARE HERE!
>> BUS LOADS OF NEW SENATORS
ARRIVING ON CAPITOL HILL.
>> COLLECTING NEW LAPTOPS,
BLACKBERS BERRIES AND A CRUSHING
LOAD OF READINGS.
>> THEY ARE FINDING OUT WHERE
THE OFFICERS WILL BE.
WHERE THE CALF YEAR TO IS.
>> Jon: WHERE YOU GET THE SHOT
THAT KILLS YOUR CONSCIENCE, THE
SECRET DOOR TO THE UNDERGROUND
LOBBY DISCO AND WASHINGTON
MONUMENT'S BALLS.
KID OF COURSE.
THEY OVERWROTE THE BOOK ON
ETHICS.
THEY COMPLICATED TO THE SENSE
IT'S MEANINGLESS.
THIS IS JUST THE ETHICS MANUAL.
>> Jon: EVERY QUESTION IN THIS
BOOK ANSWERED:  HOW ABOUT THIS?
SOMEBODY PUTS A BAG OF MONEY IN
MY PANTS BUT I DON'T TOUCH WIT
MY HANDS?
DOES THAT COUNT?
IS IT AN ETHICAL VIOLATION IF
THE SEX I'M HAVING OUT OF MY
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE IS
ANONYMOUS.
IS THERE A GLORY LOOPHOLE, IF
WILL YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE -- WHAT A
SOPHISTICATED --
[LAUGHTER]
THERE'S THIS SUPERNICE OLD LADY
IN THE AUDIENCE AND I IMAGINE
RIGHT NOW -- I CAN'T TELL YOU,
BUT I IMAGINE HER CHILDREN
LEANING OVER GOING, HE'S TALKING
ABOUT VILLAGE BLOW (bleep).
[LAUGHTER]
FRESHMEN COULD WALK DOWN THE
HALL AND WATCH AN ETHICS CASE
UNFOLD LIVE LIKING THROUGH
THROUGH A CORRUPTIONAL
WILLIAMSBURG.
>> ARE YOU REPRESENTED BY
COUNCIL TODAY OR ARE YOU
REPRESENT -- REPRESENTED BY
COUNSEL TODAY OR ARE YOU
REPRESENTING YOURSELF?
>> I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
EXPLAIN MY POSITION EVER BECAUSE
OF RULES OF CONFIDENTALITY.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT WE HAVE
THANKSGIVING, CHRISTMAS AND
CONGRESSIONAL TRIPS, NO IDEA OF
HOW COUNSEL INTENDS TO PROCEED.
[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OKAY A COUPLE OF
THINGS.
ONE, YOU'VE BEEN IN CONGRESS 40
YEARS.
YOU WERE CHAIRMAN THE ALL POWER
HOUSE AND WAYS COMMITTEE AND YOU
STILL DON'T KNOW YOU ARE NOT
SUPPOSED TO STAND UP AT A
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING.
THEY HAVE ONE CAMERA ANGLE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NUMBER TWO, YOU'VE BEEN
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR TWO
YEARS, HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE A
LAWYER?
>> YOU MAY HIRE WHOEVER YOU WISH
AS A LIR.
THAT IS UP TO YOU.
>> YOU HAVE SEEN THE RECORD.
$2 MILLION ALREADY.
AND I'VE BEEN ADVISED THAT THIS
HEARING COULD COST ME ANOTHER
MILLION.
>> Jon: PRETTY BALLSY CLAIMING
POORHOUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SPENT
CAMPAIGN MONEY ON THE DEFENSE.
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO PAY FOR
THIS.
>> I HAVE LAWYERS FROM
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND NEW YORK
WILLING TO GIVE ME FREE COUNCIL
BUT THEY SAY IF THEY DO IT'S A
GIFT AND VIOLATES ALL OF THE
LAWS.
>> Jon: YOU ARE UPSET THAT
EVEN YOUR LEGAL DEFENSE CARRIES
WITH IT SOME ETHICAL BOUNDARIES?
CAN'T I AT LEAST FIGHT ETHICS
CHARGES UNETHICALLY?
[LAUGHTER]
I'M MERELY ASKING TO ACCEPT FREE
LEGAL REPRESENTATION.
WON'T BE A GIFT BECAUSE I'LL
MOST LIKELY COMPENSATE THEM IN
THE FORM OF FAVORABLE
LEGISLATION.
[LAUGHTER]
A POSITION I'M FORCED INTO
BECAUSE THE ESTEEMED COMMITTEE
HAS INFORMED ME --
[LAUGHTER]
-- THEY WILL NOT ALLOW TIME FOR
ME TO --
[LAUGHTER]
-- SET UP A COUNTERFEITING
OPERATION.
[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE THE PLATES, THE HAVE
THE --
[LAUGHTER]
-- INK, THE PAPER, BUT WHAT I
DON'T HAVE IS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO
PRINT MY OWN MONEY TO PAY FOR A
DEFENSE ON CHARGES I VIOLATED MY
ETHICS.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHY I CAN IMITATE HIM
VERY WELL BECAUSE HE IS IN
ESSENCE AN OLD JEWISH MAN.
I MEAN AGHHHH -- GOOD I GET A --
RANGEL HAS BASICALLY CROOBATED
ALL THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM.
I GUESS $2-$3 MILLION IS A SMALL
PRICE TO PAY TO KEEP YOURSELF
FROM BEING THROWN IN JAIL OR OUT
OF CONGRESS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE FACING
RIGHT?
>> THERE ARE VARYING LEAVES OF
REBUKES COULD HE COULD FACE,
MAYBE A REPRIMAND, MAYBE A FINE.
>> Jon: ARE YOU (bleep)
KIDDING ME?
CHARLIE RANGEL SPENT YEARS
PRETENDING LIKE THE RULES DON'T
APPLY TO HIM AND EVEN AFTER HE
GETS CAUGHT HE SPENDS TWO YEARS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
BEMOANING HOW HE IS NOT ALLOWED
TO CREATE THE TERMS OF HIS OWN
DEFENSE ALL TO ULTIMATELY AVOID
HIS FELLOW CONGRESS PEOPLE FROM
GETTING TOGETHER AND SAYING UNTO
HIM, CHARLIE, CHARLIE -- YOU,
THAT WAS BAD, CHARLIE.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
GO SIT DOWN.
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE COME
UPENCE IS GOING TO COME:  FROM
THE PEOPLE.
>> HE WAS REELECTED TO HIS 21ST
TERM WITH 80% OF THE VOTE.
[LAUGHTER]
