>> Jon: HERE WE GO. WELCOMEBACK.
WE'RE TALKING WITH FORMERPRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: SO, I OCCASIONALLY WATCH
THE NEWS --(LAUGHTER)
IT APPEARS, BY WATCHING IT, THATTHERE'S BEEN A DISINTIGRATION OF
THE WORLD ORDER, OF WHATEVERSORT OF STRUCTURES HAD BEEN
BUILT UP OVER THE LAST 20 OR 30YEARS.
IS THAT YOUR SENSE OF IT ASWELL, OR IS IT AN EXAGGERATED
SENSE OF SOMETHING SPIRALING OUTOF CONTROL?
>> WELL, THERE IS ADISINTEGRATION, TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT, BUT IT'S EXAGGERATED INTHE SENSE THAT ALL THE NEWS IS
BAD. BUT THAT'S THE HEADLINES,THE TRENDLINES ARE MORE GOOD
THAN BAD. AND LET MEEXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN.
THE EXPLOSION IN INFORMATIONTECHNOLOGY AND OTHER FACTORS
HAVE MADE POWER MORE DIFFUSE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE CAN GIVECELL PHONSE TO FISHERMAN IN
INDONESIA IN THE AFTERMATH OFTHE TSUNAMI, AND THEIR INCOME
GOES UP 30% BECAUSE FOR THEFIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY
KNOW WHAT THE REAL PRICE OF FISHIS. THE BAD NEWS IS THE SAME
TECHNOLOGY CAN GO TO I.S.I.S ANDTHEY CAN BECOME A DROID ON
THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL OF ASUDDEN YOU SEE TWO AUSTRIAN
TEENAGE GIRLS PICKED UP AT THEAIRPORT TRYING TO GO THERE AND
BLOW PEOPLE UP FOR THEM.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO POWER IS MORE DIFFUSE, ANDYOU'VE GOT TO BE, THEREFORE,
MORE INCLUSIVE TO EXERCISE IT.SO THE REASON I THINK THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO COMBATI.S.I.S. HAS A CHANCE TO SUCCEED
IS THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENTFINALLY INCLUDES SUNNIS WHO WERE
REPRESENTING THOSE TRIBALLEADERS WHO ARE MODERATE AND
WITHOUT WHOM I.S.I.S. CANNOT BEDEFEATED. I MEAN, WE CAN GIVE
THEM INTELLIGENCE AND WE CAN DOBOMBING AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT
TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THEM THATTHERE'S A PRICE FOR
DECAPITATING THOSE TWO PEOPLE.>> Jon: MM-HMM.
>> YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE GET AWAYWITH THAT, THAT'S A TERRIBLE
SIGNAL TO THE WORLD. BUT WECAN'T WIN A LAND WAR IN IRAQ.
WE PROVED THAT. BUT THEY CAN ANDWE CAN HELP THEM WIN IT.
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE WHAT WE'RETRYING TO DO. SO, IF YOU WANT TO
HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKSTHAT'S EFFECTIVE, IT HAS TO BE
INCLUSIVE, OTHERWISE, OR IT CANBE AUTHORITARIAN AND JUST GET
RID OF EVERYBODY THEY DISAGREEWITH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, THERE'S BASICALLY THREEMODELS GRIPPING THE WORLD.
THERE'S THE ENTREPRENEURIALNON-GOVERNMENTAL MODEL
WHICH IS GREAT IF IT'S THEGATES FOUNDATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NOT SO GREAT IFIT'S I.S.I.S.
>> OR WHAT WE TRY TO DO. ANDTERRIBLE IF IT'S I.S.I.S.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> THERE'S THE AUTHORITARIANISM
CAPITALISM MODEL WHICH IS RUSSIAAND IN A DIFFERENT WAY CHINA
AND HAS SOME APPEAL LIKE THEHUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER,
THEY OWE A LOT TO AMERICA, HEJUST SAYS HE LIKES AUTHORITARIAN
CAPITALISM, BUT HE'S JUST SAYINGI DON'T WANT TO EVER LEAVE
POWER.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> USUALLY THOSE GUYS JUST WANTTO STAY FOREVER AND MAKE MONEY.
BUT THEN THERE'S THE DEMOCRACYMODEL. IF THE DEMOCRACY MODEL
IS GOING TO WORK, IT HAS TO BEINCLUSIVE.
THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY WORKSIN THE MODERN WORLD IS
COOPERATION AND GETTINGDIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE
TOGETHER, BRINGING THEIR SKILLSTOGETHER.
THAT'S WHY THE CLINTON GLOBALINITIATIVE HELPED 400 MILLION
PEOPLE IN 180 COUNTRIES BECAUSEWE HAVE THESE NETWORKS OF
COOPERATION AND THEY JUST GROWAND GROW.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: DOES THE UNITED STATES,
THOUGH, DOES THE UNITED STATESHAVE TO READJUST ITS MODEL THEN
FOR PROJECTING POWER IN THIS NEWMORE INCLUSIVE WORLD?
DO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT A LESSSTRENUOUS VERSION OF A
PROJECTION OF POWER AND ALSOACCEPT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
PERFECT? YOU CAN'T ERADICATEIDEOLOGIES BECAUSE THINGS LIKE
9/11 WERE PLANNED IN ATHREE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN
MUNICH. YOU CAN'T...>> WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT WE MAY NOT WIN EVERYBATTLE. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE
FACT THAT WE BASICALLY ARE INWHAT IS PROBABLY --
WE'RE PROBABLY ABOUT HALWAYTHROUGH SINCE THE END OF THE
COLD WAR, A 50-YEAR STRUGGLE TODEFINE THE TERMS OF OUR
INTER-DEPENDENCE. BUT WE KNOW WEARE INTER-DEPENDENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> THAT IS,
ALL THE BORDERS OF THE WORLDLOOK MORE LIKE NETS THAN WALLS.
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THISBORDER PROBLEM WE HAD RECENTLY
WITH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN KIDSSHOWING UP.
THEY MOSTLY WERE RUNNING AWAYFROM GANG VIOLENCE AND
NARCO-TRAFFICKERS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE FARFEWER ILLEGALS CROSSING THIS
BORDER THAN WHEN I WAS PRESIDENTAND THE ECONOMY WAS BOOMING
AND WE HAD TO BUILD UP THEDEFENSES THERE.
WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT DOING NEARLYAS BAD AS PEOPLE PERCEIVE
BECAUSE WE CONFUSE THE HEADLINESWITH THE TRENDLINES.
BUT IN ORDER TO PREVAIL, WE'REGOING TO HAVE TO BE
INCLUSIVE, NIMBLE, QUICK,AND REALIZE THAT YOU CAN
NEVER FIGHT SOMEONE ELSE'SBATTLE FOR THEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU CAN JUST HELP THEM WINIT. AND IF THEY'RE WILLING TO
FIGHT FOR THE THINGS WE BELIEVEIN IN A WAY THAT ENHANCES OUR
SECURITY AND THEIRS AND THEIRCHILDREN'S FUTURE,
THEN WE SHOULD HELP THEM. BUT IFTHEY'RE NOT, THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSEAND WIN A GROUND WAR.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BECAUSE IT'S A HOME GAME
FOR THEM AND AN AWAY GAME FORUS.
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SURVIVE,BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER WE WILL
WANT TO GO HOME. BUT WE CAN ANDSHOULD HELP WHEN THEY'RE
WILLING TO HELP. THAT'S WHAT WEDID IN KOSOVO, THAT'S WHAT WE
DID IN BOSNIA, NOW THAT'S WHATWE'RE ABOUT TO BE IN A POSITION
I HOPE TO DO IN IRAQ.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND IT JUST DEPENDS, THEREAREN'T THERE AREN'T ANY
GUARANTEES HERE. BUT KEEP INMIND, UNDERNEATH THIS,
THAT'S WHY THE REST OF US HAVETO TRY AND MAKE GOOD THINGS
HAPPEN.
EXTREME POVERTY IS DOWN.MATERNAL MORTALITY IS DOWN.
KIDS ARE LIVING LONGER.
>> Jon: MIDDLE CLASS IS RISINGAROUND THE WORLD, JUST NOT HERE.
>> YES. WELL, THAT'S A DIFFERENTSTORY.
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A DIFFERENTSTRATEGY IN AMERICA.
BUT EXTREME POVERTY HAS DROPPEDDRAMATICALLY AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IN TINY RWANDA, THEGOVERNMENT CREATED ALL THESE NEW
VILLAGES SO THAT PEOPLE WOULDHAVE DECENT HOUSING AND CREATED
STALLS FOR MILK COWS AND PLACESTO STORE THE MILK TO KEEP IT
FROM BEING DESTROYED. THAT ONETHING, GIVING A MILK COW TO
EVERY RURAL FAMILY TOOK 670,000PEOPLE OUT OF EXTREME POVERTY...
>> Jon: WOW.
>> INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEGLOBAL MIDDLE CLASS.
SO WE CAN DO THESE THINGS, BUTWE'VE GOT TO HAVE PATIENCE
AND WE CAN'T BE ARROGANT ANDWE'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT
INCLUSION WORKS ANDUNILATERALISM DOESN'T.
>> Jon: RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT --YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME FIVE OR
TEN MORE MINUTES, AREN'T YOU?>> YEAH.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A NICEMAN.
WE'LL BE BACK ON THE WEB.PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
