>> Jon: WELCOME BACK
EVERYBODY TO OUR CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF ELECTION NIGHT.
WE HAVE NEW RESULTS COMING IN,
WITH 20% REPORTING, THE STATE
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS BEEN CALLED
FOR BARACK OBAMA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> OF COURSE, THE NICKNAME OF
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE GRANITE
STATE, WHICH IS APTLY NAMED
BECAUSE AFTER THE SHOW TONIGHT I
WILL SLAM MY HEAD INTO A KITCHEN
COUNTER.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THE OTHER
CHOICE, THERE WAS "GET ( NO
AUDIO ) OR JUMP OFF A BRIDGE"
WAS THE OTHER STATE MOTTO, NEW
HAMPSHIRE.
>> Stephen: I HAVE DONE BOTH.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
ALSO WE HAVE GOT WITH
67% REPORTING KENTUCKY IS
BEING CALLED FOR JOHN McCAIN!
>> Stephen: WHAT?
>> Jon: YEP.
>> Stephen: WHICH IS GOOD,
BECAUSE IF YOU STUMBLE IN
KENTUCKY, THERE IS ALWAYS A
VETERINARIAN NEARBY READY TO
SHOOT YOU.
>> Jon: VEGETARIANS.
>> Stephen: EVIDENTLY, MOSTLY.
>> Jon: THEY CALL JOHN McCAIN
THE LIEU INDUSTRIAL SLUGGER
BECAUSE LOUISVILLE SLUGGER
BECAUSE HE IS TEN% PORK.
>> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HAVE
OVER THERE, JON?
GIVE ME A BIG STATE, AN
EASTERN STATE.
>> I WILL GIVE YOU-- IT IS NOT A
HUGE SURPRISE-- CONNECTICUT,
KNOWN
AS THE NUTMEG STATE--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NICE TO SEE SOME OF THE FANS
TRAVELED SO FAR TO BE WITH US
TONIGHT ON THE METRO NORTH.
THE NUTMEG STATE, NAMED THE
NUTMEG STATE BECAUSE WHILE IT IS
NICE TO HAVE, IT IS CLEARLY
NEVER ESSENTIAL, SO LET'S GO
WITH-- LET'S GO WITH
CONNECTICUT, THEY ARE GOING WITH
BARACK OBAMA.
BARACK OBAMA HAS TAKEN
CONNECTICUT 64% TO 35%, I
BELIEVE WITH 26% REPORTING
THERE, SO THERE IT IS.
>> Stephen: THIS IS A BETRAYAL
OF JOE LIEBERMAN.
>> Jon: I KNOW.
>> Stephen: I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE
PEOPLE OF CONNECTICUT COULD HAVE
LEARNED SUCH DISLOYAL BEHAVIOR!
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: SO WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
A BIG, A QUICK SHOT AT THE
ELECTORAL MAP TO SEE WHERE IT
STANDS.
YOU NEED 270, HE HAS 207.
270 NEEDED TO WIN.
MEANWHILE, WE ARE ALL
OVER TONIGHT'S RESULTS.
WE ARE AT OBAMA HEADQUARTERS IN
OHIO.
JASON, TALK TO ME.
JASON, WHAT IS THE MOOD OUT
THERE TONIGHT IN CHICAGO?
>> CAUTIOUS-- VERY CAUTIOUS
OPTIMISM, JON.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE FINAL POLL IS PRETTY MUCH
CORROBORATING THE INTERNAL
NUMBERS, SOME OF THOSE MOUNTAIN
WEST STATES, NEVADA, COLORADO,
THERE SHOULD BE-- WHAT IS THAT,
BLUEY?
( BIRD TWITTERS )
POLLS HAVE JUST CLOSED THERE,
SO THEY ARE MONITORING THOSE
NUMBERS VERY CLOSELY.
>> Jon: JASON, I LIVED IN
CHICAGO, WHAT PART OF CHICAGO IS
THAT THAT YOU ARE IN?
>> SOUTH SIDE!
SAY, THIS IS WHAT THE WINDY CITY
LOOKS LIKE WHEN
OBAMA IS IN TOWN.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO SAY,
NICK, BUT THE DEER THAT JUST
WALKED IN LOOKS A LITTLE JUMPY,
JASON, A LITTLE JUMPY.
>> HE IS A LOT OF THESE WOODLAND
CREATURES ARE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT
A McCAIN-PALIN ADMINISTRATION.
A FUN FACT-- SHE ACTUALLY
KILLED THIS GUY'S MOTHER WHILE
HANG-GLIDING AND BOW HUNTING.
A GREAT SHOT.
>> HEY, WHICH ONE OF YOU JERKS
PUT A BLUE TURD ON MY SHOE?
>> Jon: TURNOUT A HUGE STORY,
VERY MUCH LIKELY THE HIGHEST
NUMBER EVER TO CAST BALLOTS.
HUGE NUMBERS.
( CHEERS AND APPALUSE )
>> Jon: HUGE NUMBERS TODAY,
ROSS.
ANY VOTER SUPPRESSION TO REPORT
ON?
>> NOT TO SPEAK OF, JON, BUT I
CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.
STOPPED MAYBE 15 OR 20 PEOPLE
FROM GETTING TO THE POLLS, BUT
THEY ARE FAST LITTLE ( NO
AUDIO ).
YOU TACKLE ONE, AND THREE MORE
OF THEM SNEAK AROUND BEHIND YOU.
YOU TRY TO TAZE ONE OF
THEM, IT IS JUST SO FRUSTRATING,
EVEN THOUGH I TAZED ONE.
>> Jon: GOOD JOB.
NOW, WHILE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO
CALL THIS RACE UNTIL THE SUPREME
COURT VOTES FIVE TO FOUR TO
STOPTHE COUNT, IT IS NOT TOO
EARLY TO ASK WHAT IS AT STAKE
HERE.
TO FIND OUTLET'S CHECK IN WITH
SENIOR ELECTORAL CORRESPOND
DEMOCRATIC JOHN OLIVER AT OUR
ELECTION CENTER.
>> GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN.
I AM OVER AWED BY THE MAJESTY
OF YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM,
THIS PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER,
WHEREIN TWO MEN VIE TO GRAB THE
REINS OF THE MOST POWERFUL
NATION ON EARTH AND GUIDE IT
INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM.
A RESPONSIBILITY TO MANKIND
BOTH GREAT AND NOBLE.
>> Jon: I AM GOING TO GO OUT ON
A LIMB HERE AND SAY YOUR VISA IS
UP, ISN'T IT?
>> YOU KNOW IT IS, AND I WOULD
APPRECIATE YOU NOT BRINGING IT
UP NOW.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: JOHN, THERE IS GOING TO
BE AN AWFUL LOT OF CHALLENGES
FACING WHOEVER WINS THIS
ELECTION.
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT ELECT
REALLY GOING TO BE UP AGAINST?
>> WELL, JON, THE INCOMING
PRESIDENT IS INHERITING A
MULTILAYERED PROBLEM-- ONE LAYER
BEING A DEBT TO CHINA SO
ENORMOUS THE CHINESE ARE NOW
LEGALLY ALLOWED TO KEEP YOU AS
PETS.
ANOTHER LAYER, A FINANCE
IMPLOSION SO DIRE THAT AMERICANS
HAVE STARTED E-MAILING NIGERIAN
PRINCES.
AND A QUICK WORD TO NIGERIANS
ON THIS ONE-- DON'T DO IT, IT IS
A SCAM!
THESE TWO MEATY LAYERS OF
CRISES ARE NESTLED BETWEEN TWO
TOASTED SESAME SEED WARS.
>> Jon: SO HE WILL INHERIT SOME
TYPE OF PROBLEM SANDWICH?
>> WELL, I SEE IT AS MORE OF A
GIANT ( NO AUDIO )BURGER,
ALTHOUGH, OBVIOUSLY I, AM NEW TO
YOUR COUNTRY.
PERHAPS YOU AMERICANS CALL IT A
"CRAP TACO," OR A "TURD
POUNDER WITH CHEESE".
IN FRANCE THEY CALL IT A "METAL
PATTY ROYALE."
>> Jon: AS A WATCHER OF THIS
TYPE OF ELECTIONS, IS THIS AS
BAD AS IT HAS EVER BEEN IN THIS
COUNTRY?
>> JON, NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN
ANYTHING AS BAD AS THIS SINCE
FDR LEFT HIS HOAGIE SANDWICH ON
HOOVER'S DOORSTEP.
>> Stephen: I WASN'T LISTENING.
I WAS CHECKING THE RESULTS OF
PICK TEN LOTTO, THINGS ARE
LOOKING VERY GOOD FOR NINE.
>> WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
