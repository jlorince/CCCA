>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK TO THESHOW.
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT NEWYORKERS.
( LAUGHTER )IN TIMES OF CRISIS THOUGH WE'RE
AT OUR BEST.
AFTER THE CRISIS, ANOTHER STORY.
JORDAN KLEPPER EXPLAINS.
>>  THE WINTER OF2015 HAS WREAKED HAVOC ALL OVER
THE NORTHEAST, AND SOME NEWYORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR HOMES
DESTROYED BY THE RECENTBLIZZARD.
STATEN ISLANDERS AIMAN YOUSSEF.
>> IT WAS NOT BLIZZARD.
>> RIGHT. AN ICE STORM.
>> IT WAS NOT AN ICE STORM.
>> FROZEN HAIL?
>> THAT'S NOT IT, EITHER.
IT WAS FROM HURRICANE SANDY.
>> WHAT, THAT WAS LIKE TWO YEARSAGO.
>> EXACTLY, TWO YEARS AGO, WE'RESTILL IN A TENT.
>> WHAT?
WE HAD A CONCERT TO HELP.
WE HAD MICK JAGGER THERE AND THEBOSS WAS THERE AND THEN WE HAD
ANOTHER CONCERT AND THERE WERECOMMERCIALS AND THIS GUY IS
STILL IN A TENT?
SO THIS IS WHERE YOUR HOUSE USEDTO BE.
>> CORRECT.
>> THIS USED TO BE YOUR LIVINGROOM?
>> YES.
>> AND HE'S NOT ALONE.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLESTILL WITHOUT HOMES.
>> NOBODY'S HOME, ME INCLUDED.
>> IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO AND AHALF YEARS ALREADY.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REBUILT.
>> YOU KNOW, WE'RE FROM NEWYORK.
HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY TAKETHIS LONG?
>> OKAY, WAIT, MORE THAN $648MILLION WAS SET ASIDE FOR AN
ORGANIZATION CALLED BUILD ITBACK WHICH WAS CREATED SOLELY
TO-- IT'S IN THE NAME-- BUILDPEOPLE'S HOUSES BACK.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE GUYS?
>> BUILD IT BACK REALLY SUCKS.
>> BUILT IT BACK, THEY BUILDNOTHING.
>> THEY LOSE PAPERWORK.
IT'S JUST BEEN-- NO ANSWERS, ANDNO PROGRESS.
>> WE HAVE NO HOMES BUT WE PAYTAXES ON THOSE HOMES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.>> WHAT?
>> I'M STILL PAYINGFLOOD INSURANCE.
THEY DIDN'T FINISH PAYING ME,BUT I AM STILL PAYING THEM.
>> WE NEED TWO FLOORS AND THEYONLY WANT TO FINISH ONE.
AND ALL WE WANT IS WHAT WE HADBEFORE.
SIMPLE KITCHEN, SIMPLE LIVINGROOM AND A BATHROOM.
>> WOAH, WOAH, WOAH. WHAT ELSE?
>> DOORS WOULD BE NICE. >> PLURAL.
>> YEAH, DOORS ON THE BEDROOMS,MAYBE A FRONT DOOR.
>> YOU SEE HOW THIS COULD TAKE AWHILE.
IF I DO THE MATH HERE, THIS IS A17-YEAR PROJECT.
IT'S BECAUSE BUILDING IN NEWYORK CITY IS COMPLICATED.
JUST ASK ARCHITECT ENRIQUENORTON.
>> NEW YORK IS A VERY COMPLEXCITY.
BUT OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, A LOTOF THINGS GET BUILT HERE AND A
LOT OF VERY GOOD THINGS GETBUILT HERE.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECENTLYCOMPLETED THE MERCEDES HOUSE.
>> NOW HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE TOCOMPLETE?
>> THIS TOOK TO COMPLETEAPPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS.
>> OR JUST A LITTLE BIT MORETIME THAN THE SANDY VICTIMS ARE
WAITING FOR THEIR HOMES.
>> BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1.2MILLION SQUARE FEET.
>> THAT'S NOT 1.2 MILLION SQUAREFEET.
>> NO, THIS IS ONLY A MODEL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEBUILDING.
>> THE ACTUAL BUILDING.
THIS?
>> YEAH, WE DID THIS BUILDING.
>> YOU BUILT THIS IN THREEYEARS, AND NOTHING, NOTHING IS
GOING ON IN STATEN ISLAND.
UNBELIEVABLE.
UNREAL.
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEMHERE?
>> BUREAUCRACY IS TO BLAME FORNOT REBUILDING HOMES.
>> NOTHING GOOD EVER HAPPENEDWITHOUT BUREAUCRACY.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT,RIGHT?
>> WHAT?
>> LET'S GO OUT IN THE BACKYARD,AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT
BUREAUCRACY, AND WE'LL SEE WHATCOMES OUT OF IT.
>> WAIT, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPENIN THE BACKYARD.
>> WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE( BLEEP ) OUT OF YOU?
>> WHAT, I THOUGHT WE WERE JUSTGOING TO TALK ABOUT BUREAUCRACY
AND SIGN SOME PAPERS.
OKAY UNDERSTANDABLY, THINGSWERE GETTING TENSE SO I TURNED
TO LOCAL ADVOCATE ALANA TORNELLOTO SEE WHAT I COULD DO.
I'M GOING TO DROP THE IRONIC,HANDSOME JORDAN KLEPPER
CHARACTER, AND I'M JUSTGOING TO BE JUST HANDSOME
JORDAN KLEPPER.
I WANT TO HELP.
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?
>> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE ANY SKILLS?
( LAUGHTER )WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY
SKILLS TO COME VOLUNTEER.
>> GREAT.
>> AS THE MEDIA, THERE IS A LOTTHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE IT VERY
CLEAR THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE, FORSOME NEW YORKERS, THIS IS STILL
A DISASTER AND THIS IS STILL ASTORY.
>> WHAT?
>> I'M TALKING TO YOU.
THIS IS YOU.
YOU CAN DO THIS.
NOT AS THE MEDIA.
>> OH.
OH!
>> RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> OH
YEAH!
OH RIGHT!
OH, YEAH, THIS THING.
>> YEAH, YOU CAN REMIND PEOPLETHAT THIS IS STILL A NEWS STORY.
>> DONE.
>> OKAY?
THANKS.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOINGHERETO WHOLE TIME.
LOOKS LIKE MY WORK AS A MEDIAPROFESSIONAL IS DONE.
BUT UNTIL HELP REALLY DOESARRIVE, SANDY VICTIMS MAY NEED A
LITTLE PATIENCE, COURTESY OFSTATEN ISLAND'S THIRD MOST
POPULAR GUNS N' ROSES TRIBUTEBAND.
OH, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'TPLAY ACTUAL "PATIENCE."
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHTS TOTHAT.
♪ I'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY♪♪
>>, OF COURSE, AFTER TWO AND AHALF YEARS, THESE GUYS HAVE A
PRETTY SIMPLE MESSAGE FOR ANYONEWHO THINKS THEY SHOULD WAIT A
LITTLE LONGER.
>> Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER,  WE'LLBE RIGHT BACK.
