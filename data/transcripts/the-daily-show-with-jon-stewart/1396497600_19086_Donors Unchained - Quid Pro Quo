SO LET ME GET THAT STRAIGHT.
JUSTICE ALITO DOESN'T SEE HOWMONEY CORRUPTS POLITICS UNLESS
YOU CAN DRAW A STRAIGHT LINEFROM I AM GIVING YOU THIS MONEY
TO DO THIS THING FOR ME.
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND JUSTICEALITO A BROADER NONLITERAL QUID
QUO PRO LIKE AN HISTORICALEXAMPLE OF THE CORRUPTING
INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS.
WHAT IF WE REACHED BACK INHISTORY TO LIKE THIS WEEKEND.
>> THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AREHEADING WEST TO LAS VEGAS.
THEY ARE SPEAKING AT THE SPRINGMEETING OF REPUBLICAN JEWISH
COALITION BUT MORE IMPORTANTTHEIR PRIVATE TALKS WITH ONE
MAN, REPUBLICAN SUPERDONOR SHELDON ADELSON.
>> Jon: I WOULD RESPECTFULLYLIKE TO APPROACH THE BENCH AND
REMIND THE COURT THAT WHEN THEMEDIA REFERS TO SHELDON ADELSON
AS A SUPER DONOR THEY ARE NOTTALKING SPERM.
I HOPE.
A PACK OF REPUBLICANPRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS JUST FLEW
ALL THE WAY TO LAS VEGAS JUST TOKISS THE SCOOTER RIDING ASS OF
ONE 80-YEAR-OLDBILLIONAIRE.
DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHINGTHOUGH RIGHT.
I MEAN PEOPLE ON FEAR FACTORSPEED EAT A PLATE OF BULL
TESTICLES FOR $50,000.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE TWO ARECONNECTED.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MONEYCHANGES THEIR BEHAVIOR.
>> LATER ACCORDING TONBC NEWS CHRISTIE DID APOLOGIZETO ADELSON.
>> HE ENDED UP HAVING TOAPOLOGIZE FOR REFERRING THE WEST
BANK AS QUOTE OCCUPIEDTERRITORY.
>> Jon: STILL DON'T THINKMONEY HAS A MORE
GENERL CORRUPTING INFLUENCEON POLITICS? CAUSE I CAN TELL
YOU THIS MY FAMILYIS FULL OF 80-YEAR-OLD JEWS WHO
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO TELLPOLITICIANS WHAT WORDS THEY CAN
AND CANNOT USE TO DESCRIBEISRAEL BUT AS OF THIS TAPING NO
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS HAVE FLOWNTO THEIR HOUSE TO SOLICIT THAT
OPINION.
OBVIOUSLY WE TAPE AT 6:00, THESHOW IS ON AT 11:00, THINGS
COULD CHANGE BETWEENTHAT TIME. THERE MAY
BE A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULSCONFERENCE AT MY AUNT DORIS'S
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
IF SO OBVIOUSLY MONDAY'S SHOWWILL BE A FULL APOLOGY.
IN WHO'S DELUSIONAL MIND ISDEMOCRACY MADE BETTER BY LETTING
WEALTHIER PEOPLE CONTROL MORE OFIT?
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEPOLITICAL LEFT DOESN'T LIKE
DECISIONS LIKE CITIZENS UNITEDAND McCUTCHEON BECAUSE THEY
EXPAND THE PLAYING FIELD.
THEY ENABLE MORE CITIZENS TO BEINVOLVED, MORE CITIZENS
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CANDIDATESAND CAUSES THEY BELIEVE IN.
THAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA.
>> Jon: (bleep).
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I CAN'T EVEN DO THE TURTLE
VOICE.
I WON'T EVEN -- HOW THE(bleep) DOES THIS DECISION
ENABLE MORE CITIZENS TOCONTRIBUTE?
ACCORDING TO THE AP IN 2012, 646INDIVIDUALS BUMPED UP AGAINST
THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITTHAT THIS CASE STRUCK DOWN.
MCCUTCHEON DOESN'T GET MOREPEOPLE INVOLVED.
IT LETS THOSE 646 INDIVIDUALSGET THEMSELVES MORE INVOLVED.
HOW DID THE SUPREME COURT HANDLEVOTER I.D. LAWS?
>> THEY SAID STATES CAN REQUIREA VOTER I.D. AT THE POLLS TO
PREVENT VOTER FRAUD.
>> Jon: THE COURT CONVENIENTLYIGNORES THE REAL EFFECTS OF
DONOR LOBBYIST INDUSTRIALCOMPLEX UNDER THE GUISE OF
MAKING OUR DEMOCRACY MOREINCLUSIVE YET THEY ARE
PERFECTLY OKAY WITH VOTERI.D. LAWS UNDER THE GUISE OF
PROTECTING US MOSTLY NONEXISTENTVOTER IN PERSON VOTER FRAUD.
ACTUALLY MAKES OUR DEMOCRACYLESS INCLUSIVE.
CORRUPTION THAT ACTUALLYHAPPENS, I DON'T SEE IT.
VOTER FRAUD THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN?
HM?
[LAUGHTER]JUSTICE IS BLIND BUT IN ONLY ONE
EYE.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO MONEY DOESN'T CORRUPT OUR
SYSTEM.
LAST YEAR THEY STRUCK DOWN PARTSOF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
RACISM DOESN'T APPARENTLYCORRUPT OUR SYSTEM ANYMORE
BECAUSE THESE JUSTICES STRUCKDOWN SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PARTS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
SO WHAT IF THE VIEW OF THESEJUSTICES HAS A CORRUPTING
INFLUENCE ON OUR DEMOCRATICPROCESS?
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THE RULESWILL CHANGE IN ALLOWING
TELEVISION CAMERAS IN THE COURT?
>> NOT A CHANCE BECAUSE WE DON'TWANT TO BECOME ENTERTAINMENT.
>> I THINK THERE'S SOMETHINGSICK ABOUT MAKING ENTERTAINMENT
OUT OF REAL PEOPLE'S LEGALPROBLEMS.
>> THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THEIMPACT ON TELEVISION ON THE
FUNCTIONING OF THE INSTITUTION,BOTH THE CIVIL TRIAL AND THE
SUPREME COURT ARGUMENT.
ALL OF THE JUSTICES VIEWTHEMSELVES AS TRUSTEES OF THE AN
EXTREMELY VALUABLE INSTITUTION.
>> Jon: TELEVISED SUPREMECOURT HEARINGS, APPARENTLY THE
ONE THING SO CORROSIVETO THE PROCESS THAT IT CAN NEVER
BE ALLOWED TO EXERT ITS UNHOLYINFLUENCE
UPON OUR SACRED DEMOCRATICINSTITUTION IS TRANSPARENCY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
