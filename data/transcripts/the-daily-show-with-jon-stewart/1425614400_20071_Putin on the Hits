>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK! LISTEN!
IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG TIMESINCE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY
"GOOD NEWS OUT OF RUSSIA."
( LAUGHTER )AND THAT IS STILL THE CASE.
>> BORIS NEMTSOV, A FORMERRUSSIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER
UNDER BORIS YELTSIN WAS SHOTFOUR TIMES IN THE BACK.
>> NEMTSOV OF ONE OF RUSSIANPRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S
FIERCEST CRITICS.
>> THIS IS THE EXACT SPOT WHEREBORIS NEMTSOV WAS SHOT DEAD, AND
WE ARE LITERALLY JUST STEPS AWAYFROM THE KREMLIN.
>> Jon:  WOW.
STEPS AWAY FROM THE KREMLIN DOESSEEM LIKE A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR
THE KREMLIN TO MURDER SOMEONE.
( LAUGHTER )YOU KNOW, FOR THE KREMLIN,
THEY'VE GOT TO BE THINKING, WHYSCHLEP ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN?
IT'S THE SAME REASON YOU GETLUNCH AT THE DELI RIGHT NEXT TO
YOUR OFFICE EVEN THOUGHYOU'RE PRETTY SURE THEY
MAKE ALL THEIR PANINIS AMONTH IN ADVANCE.
I'M KIDDING, OF COURSE.
PUTIN COULD NOT HAVE MURDERED APOLITICAL ADVERSARY.
GEORGE BUSH LOOKED INTO HIS EYESAND SAW HIS SOUL.
HOW COULD SUCH A SOULFUL,TRUSTWORTHY MAN EVER --
OKAY, THAT PHOTOIS A BIT UNFAIR.
LET'S GET A DIFFERENT PHOTOTHERE -- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HOW DO WE KNOW THEGOVERNMENT WAS INVOLVED?
>> RUSSIAN STATE-OWN TELEVISIONAIRING THIS VIDEO THEY SAY SHOWS
THE MOMENT OF NEMTSOV'SSHOOTING.
A SNOW PLOW CONVENIENTLYBLOCKING THE VIEW.
>> Jon: NOT TO BE ASTICKLER FOR DETAILS,
BUT THAT STREET SEEMSNOT TO BE SNOWED ON.
( LAUGHTER )ALL RIGHT, LOOKS BAD.
OPPOSITION LEADER GUNNED DOWNYARDS FROM THE KREMLIN WITH WHAT
APPEARS TO BE AN OFFICIALVEHICLE CONVENIENTLY OBSCURING
THE EVENT.
BUT FEAR NOT!
THE KREMLIN IS CHASING DOWNEVERY THEORY THAT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH REALITY.
>> RUSSIAN INVESTIGATORS FLOATEDSEVERAL THEORIES.
IT WAS A CONTRACT KILLING.
THE WORK OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS.
AUTHORITIES EVEN SUGGESTED THATSOMEONE FROM WITHIN THE
OPPOSITION MAY HAVE BEEN BEHINDIT TO MAKE NEMTSOV SOME SORT OF
MARTYR.
>> MAYBE IT WAS A PERSONALISSUE, THEY SAY.
MAYBE HE WAS A MAN WITH MANYGIRLFRIENDS.
ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE BECOMEOVERLY JEALOUS.
>> Jon:  I THINK IT WASPERHAPS HUNTING ACCIDENT.
( LAUGHTER )OR MAYBE NEMTSOV, I DON'T KNOW,
TRIPPED AND FELL ON BULLETS REALHARD.
( LAUGHTER )OR TIME-TRAVELING CYBORG SENT
FROM FUTURE TO KILL NEMTSOV SOHE COULD NEVER GROW INTO LEADER
OF HUMAN RESISTANCE.
IT'S ALL TERRIBLE.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
IT'S VERY TRAGIC, ONE OFRUSSIA'S CHIEF OPPOSITION
LEADERS, A FORMERHIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF THEIR
GOVERNMENT GUNNED DOWN IN THEMOST SECURE PART OF MOSCOW.
ONE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THEAUTHORITIES WILL MOUNT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
>> PRESIDENT PUTIN VOWED TOPERSONALLY OVERSEE THE
INVESTIGATION.
>> Jon:  OH, GOOD!
( LAUGHTER )HE'S VOWING TO FIND THE REAL
KILLER.
THAT'S A PROMISE THAT ALWAYSINSPIRES CONFIDENCE.
( LAUGHTER )THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE
MORE O.J. IS IF PUTIN STARTEDSTEALING SPORTS MEMORABILIA.
OH, ( BLEEP )!
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!
( LAUGHTER )BUT ALL RIGHT, WITH PRESIDENT
PUTIN OVERSEEING THEINVESTIGATION THEY'RE DOING SOME
SERIOUS DETECTIVE WORK,SEARCHING FOR ANY CLUES LEFT
AROUND NEMTSOV'S BODY, THOUGHNOT BEFORE OTHER GOVERNMENT
WORKERS HOSED DOWN THE MURDERSCENE JUST HOURS AFTER THE
SHOOTING.
BECAUSE IN MOSCOW, APPARENTLY,"C.S.I."
STANDS FOR "CLEAN SIDEWALKSIMMEDIATELY."
( LAUGHTER )SO, OBVIOUSLY, NEMTSOV'S DEATH
MARKS A MAJOR MILESTONE IN THEREIGN OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.
HE STARTED OUT AS SOMETHING OF ANORMAL HUMAN BEING, TRANSITIONED
INTO A BIT OF AN ECCENTRICDICTATOR.
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,SOMETHING CHANGED.
THE GOOFINESS GAVE WAY TO ADARKER, MORE SINISTER PUTIN,
MUCH LIKE A YOUNG HARMLESSWIZARD WHO GOT SORTED INTO
SLYTHERIN.
SO AFTER HANGING AROUND WITHSOME OF THE BAD KIDS AND
SLEEPING IN SOME OF THEDUNGEON-Y PARTS OF HOGWARTS,
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS TURNED INTOLORD VLADIMORT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
