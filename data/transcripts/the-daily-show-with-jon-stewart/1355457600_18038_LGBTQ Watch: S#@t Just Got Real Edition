(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELL COMPANY TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
LAST SHOW OF 2012 AND OBVIOUSLY IF THE MAYANS ARE CORRECT--  (LAUGHTER) LAST SHOW.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT MY NIECE KRISTEN LEIBOWITZ WILL BE JOINING US-- I'M SORRY, STEWART.
SHE MUST HAVE CHANGED IT.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY, BOY, THAT 12-12-12 CONCERT LAST NIGHT, EVERYBODY THAT
MUCH WAD, EVERYBODY THAT PARTICIPATED, EVERYBODY THAT SAYS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT
BOYD THE SPIRITS OF EVERYBODY THERE.
IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS GOOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE DISCUSSION OF MARRIAGE.
AS YOU KNOW MARRIAGE IS UNDER ATTACK.
SO MUCH SO THAT OUR CONGRESS PASSED A DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.
AND PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED IT INTO LAW BECAUSE IT WAS THE '90s AND EVERYTHING WAS IRONIC.
(LAUGHTER) THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT PROTECTED MARRIAGE FROM THE SCOURGE OF NO FAULT DIVORCE
AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITY AND FAMILY CARE ISSUES THAT PUT SO MUCH STRAIN ON MARRIAGE-- I'M KIDDING.
IT WAS ABOUT GAY PEOPLE.
IT PROTECTED MARRIAGE FROM GAY PEOPLE.
IN FACT, GAY PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERED SUCH A THREAT TO MARRIAGE THAT IN ADDITION TO
A FEDERAL DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BANNING THE
PRACTICE, INCLUDING OUR MOST POPULOUS STATE, CALIFORNIA.
AND OUR MOST RELUCTANT TO FINALLY REPEAL INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE BANS, ALABAMA.
THEY DID IT IN THE YEAR 2000, ROLL TIDE OF HISTORY.
BEFORE YOU GET TOO SMUG ON ALABAMA REMEMBER THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T EVEN TURN IT
OVER UNTIL 1967 SO [BLEEP]
US.
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.
I MEAN THE SUPREME COURT IS TO THE GOING TO GET INVOLVED IF GAY MARRIAGE.
>> SAME-SEX COUPLES ARE FINALLY GETTING THEIR DAY IN COURT.
THIS TIME THE U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE DECIDED TO HEAR TWO CONSTITUTIONAL
CHALLENGES TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWSMENT ONE CASE INVOLVES THE FEDERAL DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE AGO OR DOMO.
THE OTHER IS A CHALLENGE TOICAL CALL'S PROP 8.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, I CANNOT BELIEVE HE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE A REPORT IN BEFORE PROM.
SECOND OF ALL--  (LAUGHTER) SECRETARY OF ALL, SECRETARY OF ALL AND PERHAPS MORE
IMPORTANTLY, THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO RULE ON GAY MARRIAGE WHICH BRINGS TO
US THE LATEST INSTALLMENT IN OUR LONG RUNNING SERIES, LGBTQ WATCH [BLEEP] JUST GOT
REAL HE --.
IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW BIG A DEAL THIS COULD BE FOR GAY MARRIAGE.
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE THE ULTIMATE DEFINITIVE DETERMINATION.
>> AND THAT COULD RESULT IN WHAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE 9 ROE V. WADE OF GAY RIGHTS.
>> Jon: SO IT WILL BE SETTLED.
I MEAN WHO ARGUES ABOUT ABORTION ANY MORE.
(LAUGHTER) REMEMBER THOSE DAYS?
TODAY?
THIS AFTERNOON?
(LAUGHTER) I'M SURE THE OPPONENTS WILL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING LIKE SURE, YOU CAN GET GAY
MARRIED BUT FIRST ONE OF YOU HAS TO HAVE A TRANSVAGINAL ULTRA
