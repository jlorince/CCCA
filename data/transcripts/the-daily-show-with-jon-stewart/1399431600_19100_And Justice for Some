[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT.
GUEST TONIGHT PETER SCHUCK.
HE IS THE AUTHOR OF "WHYGOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN AND
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT."
BUT FIRST, AS WE ALL KNOW EVERSINCE THEY VERY INNOCENTLY
CRASHED OUR ENTIRE ECONOMYTHROUGH PURPOSEFUL AND
FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES --[LAUGHTER]
-- BANKS AND THE BANKERS WHOBANK THEM --
[LAUGHTER]-- HAVE WEATHERED ATTACKS FROM
ALL CORNERS.
>> THE GOVERNMENT IS WAGING WARON BANKS.
>> THEY SAY THAT WALL STREET ISGUILTY THAT YOUR FORTUNES ARE
WHERE THEY ARE NOW BECAUSE OFTHE GREED ON WALL STREET.
>> PEOPLE WANT TO SEEGUYS IN A PERP WALK, THEY WANT
TO SEE BANKERS IN HANDCUFFSGOING TO PRISON.
>> Jon: IT'S AS THOUGH SEEINGTHEM PUNISHED APPROPRIATELY
WOULD BE SOMEHOW JUST OR RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]WELL, GUESS WHAT?
THE VAMPIRES FINALLY GOT THEIRBLOOD.
>> HIS NAME IS KAREEM SERAGELDINAND HIS TRADERS LIED ABOUT THE
VALUE OF HIS MORTGAGE BACKEDSECURITIES AND HE KNEW ABOUT
THAT AND HE SORT OF LOOKED THEOTHER WAY, AND SO HE WAS GUILTY.
>> Jon: HUH.
LYING ABOUT THE VALUE OFMORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND
LOOKING THE OTHER WAY I THINKWAS THE SLOGAN FOR ONE OF THOSE
COMPANIES, WASN'T IT?
WHY IS HE THE ONLY PERSON TOHAVE GONE TO JAIL FOR THAT
ACTIVITY?
>> HE PLED GUILTY AND HE IS NOWIN PRISON.
>> Jon: OH, HE WANT TO JAILFOR STUPIDITY.
DOESN'T HE KNOW, PLEADING GUILTYIS NOT HOW YOU ADDRESS THOSE
VERY COMMON CHARGES.
>> JP MORGAN IS PAYING $410MILLION TO SETTLE CHARGES WITH
THE GOVERNMENT BUT JP MORGAN ISNOT ADMITTING ANY WRONGDOING.
>> GOLDMAN SACHS SETTLEDEARLY ON IN THIS CASE FOR
$550 MILLION WITHOUTADMITTING WRONGDOING.
>> UBS HAS AGREED TO PAY ABOUT$50 MILLION.
UNDER THE TERMS OF SETTLEMENTUBS DID NOT ADMIT ANY
WRONGDOING.
>> Jon: THAT'S HOW WE DO.
[LAUGHTER]YOU SAY WHEN YOU ARE CAUGHT,
WHILE I CLEARLY HAVE DONENOTHING WRONG, I KNOW YOU ARE A
BUSY MAN AND YOUR TIME ISVALUABLE SO HERE IS A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOUR TROUBLES, YOUKNOW WHAT I MEAN?
GET THE GOVERNMENT'S WIFESOMETHING NICE, MAYBE A TENNIS
BRACELET.
HEY, GABBAGOUL.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT AS WALL STREET SUFFERS, THE
REAL PERPETRATORS OF FINANCIALDISTRICT WRONGDOING CONTINUE TO
PAY NO PRICE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT OCCUPY WALLSTREET.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
MIC CHECK.
I'M TALKING.
I'M TALKING.
ABOUT OCCUPY -- ABOUT OCCUPY,WALL STREET, WALL STREET.
[ LAUGHTER ]REALLY YOU ARE GOING TO
(bleep) DO THAT, REALLY?
THEY REALLY DID BECOME THEPEOPLES MICROPHONE. YOU KNOW,
THESE OCCUPY WALL STREETERSAFTER VICTIMIZING WALL STREET
JOB CREATORS BY DRUMMING INTHEIR GENERAL VICINITY, BY
WAGGLING THEIR FINGERS IN ATHREATENING MANNER OR BY RUDELY
CORNERING THE PEPPER SPRAYMARKET WITH THEIR FACES.
THE OCCUPIERS HAVE GOTTEN OFFSCOTT FREE.
EXCEPT FOR, OBVIOUSLY, THE MASSARRESTS AND PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
PEPPER SPRAY.
MY POINT IS NOT ONE OCCUPIER HASBEEN SENTENCED TO LONG-TERM
PRISON TIME.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S STILL --[LAUGHTER]
-- WALL STREET.
ONE GUY IN JAIL.
OCCUPY --[LAUGHTER]
-- UNTIL YESTERDAY.
>> AN OCCUPY WALL STREETACTIVIST WHOSE ARREST WENT
VIRAL, CECILY MCMILLAN, FACINGUP TO SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON.
>> Jon: WOO!
AN OCCUPIER HAS FINALLY BEENSENT TO JAIL.
THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE ISLONG.
BUT IT BENDS TO MOTHER (bleep)JUSTICE.
[LAUGHTER]THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S -- IT'S 1-1.
WHAT CRIME DID THIS OCCUPYPROTESTER COMMIT?
I BET THEY SERVED GLUTEN AT THEGLUTEN FREE TABLE OR SHELVED
CHOMSKEY BEFORE ZINN IN THE FREELIBRARY. EVERYBODY KNOWS C COMES
AFTER Z BECAUSE ALPHABETICALORDER IS A SYSTEM
OF HETERO-PATRIARCH NORMATIVITY-- I'M BEING TOLD
THAT MY MAN-SPLAINING FAILED TOCHECK MY PRIVILEGE.
I BET IT WAS SOMETHING LIKETHAT.
>> SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OFASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER
BACK IN 2012 AND IT WASALL CAUGHT ON VIDEO.
>> Jon: OKAY, YEAH YOU CAN'TDO THAT. THEY'LL DEFINITELY
ARREST YOU FOR THAT. AND BY THEWAY, DON'T THINK THAT THE POLICE
DIDN'T ALSO GET IN TROUBLE WHENTHEY ASSAULTED PROTESTERS, TOO.
REMEMBER THIS GUY, THE NYPDOFFICER ANTHONY BOLOGNA
AKA TONY BALONEY WHOPEPPERED PROTESTERS WITH
ENTHUSIASM RARELY SEEN OUTSIDEOF CHIPOTLE.
HE WAS PUNISHED, TOO.
HE LOST SOME VACATION DAYS ANDGOT REASSIGNED TO STATEN ISLAND,
WHERE HE IS FROM.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO NOT SO MUCH A SENTENCE AS
BEING RELEASED BACK INTO TO HISNATURAL HABITAT.
SORT OF LIKE THE END OF FREEWILLY.
YOU KNOW, FOR A GUYLIKE TONY BALONEY, I MEAN,
HE COULDN'T BE MORE ATHOME IN STATEN ISLAND UNLESS
HIS NAME WAS JIMMY PEPPERONIHEY, I'M WALKING OVER HERE.
