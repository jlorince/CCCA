YOU'VE COME AWAY.
THE ARCH OF HISTORY IS LONG BUT IT BENDS TOWARDS SHAMELESSNESS.
WHENEVER EVERYTHING INTENSE HAPPENS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY THINGS -- EMOTIONS RUB HIGH.
WE'RE JOINED BY AL MADRIGAL.
HE IS HERE IN HIS PANIC ROOM.
>> ACTUALLY JON IT'S ONE WORD:   HISPANIC NOT HIS PANIC.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: SENATE REPUBLICANS REPORTING LIVE FROM THE DEMOGRAPHIC REALITY IN THIS
COUNTRY COOPERATING WITH A BIPARTISAN AND COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL FOR
ELECTORAL PURPOSES.
YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> WHAT A MOMENT FOR HISPANICS, JOHN.
TO SEE -- JON.
TO SEE REPUBLICANS IN A LAST DITCH DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THE EXISTENCE OF THEIR
POLITICAL PARTY FINALLY REACH ACROSS THE AISLE WITH ONE HAND WHILE USES THE OTHER TO HOLD
THEIR NOSES IT'S A GREAT DAY.
FORCED AT LAST, FORCED AT LAST, THANK GOD ALMIGHTY FORCED AT LAST.
WHAT A DAY.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: THAT'S A PRETTY CYNICAL -- I HAVE TO SAY IT'S PRETTY CYNICAL POLITICAL CALCULATIONS.
>> YEAH, SURE IS.
>> Jon: I GUESS THE QUESTION IS:  WILL IT WORK?
WILL THIS BRING HISPANICS IN LARGER NUMBERS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?
>> LET'S CRUNCH SOME NUMBERS.
LET'S GET DOWN IN THE WEEDS.
BY THE WAY, WHO BETTER TO GET DOWN IN THE WEEDS, RIGHT?
>> Jon: I GET IT.
>> MEXICANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: RIGHT, MEXICANS.
>> THE WEED (bleep).
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, JUST GO.
>> JEWS ARE CHEAP.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THERE ARE MANY, MANY STEREOTYPES JUST CONTINUE.
HERE WE GO.
OBAMA BEAT ROMNEY ABOUT FIVE MILLION VOTES.
THAT'S WITH ROMNEY HAVING WON 27% OF THE LATINO VOTE WHICH MEANS IF ROMNEY MANAGED 17% MAS
THE INAUGURATION WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS.
>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ANN ROMNEY'S HAIR?
>> THOSE BANGS WERE HAPPENING NO MATTER WHO WON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: DOES THIS IMMIGRATION BILL MAKE UP FOR PAST SLIGHTS?
I MEAN, GAIN THE REPUBLICANS THE EXTRA 17% THEY NEED?
THEY'VE BEEN HARD ON THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY.
>> PROBABLY NOT, JON.
THE PROBLEM FOR VEABZ THAT WHILE OVER 90% OF -- REPUBLICANS IS WHILE OVER 90% OF HISPANICS
SUPPORT IMMIGRATION REFORM A FULL 65% OF LATINOS HOLD GRUDGES.
83% IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU DID TO THEIR SISTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: AL, HOW LONG WOULD A GRUDGE LIKE THAT TYPICALLY LAST?
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR HISPANICS TO GET OVER THE GRUDGE?
>> A LATINO GRUDGE ON AVERAGE LASTS JUST OVER FOUR GENERATIONS.
SO RIGHT THERE --
>> Jon: I GET IT.
ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> ITALIAN, IRISH --
>> Jon: MAKES SENSE.
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT A LATINO GENERATION IS ONLY SEVEN YEARS.
>> Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW.
THAT TO GET TO 51% OF THE ELECTRIC TOUR RATE THEY'LL HAVE TO -- ELECTORATE THEY'LL HAVE
TO -- THE REPUBLICANS.
>> PULL SOME VOTES OF PREVIOUSLY OFFENDED DEMOGRAPHICS.
>> Jon: 93% OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS VOTED FOR OBAMA.
PERHAPS PULL SOME FROM THERE.
>> THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.
>> I GOT THIS, AL.
THAT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN, JON, NEVER.
>> Jon: THERE'S NO WAY THE REPUBLICANS CAN CHIP AWAY AT THE AFRICAN VOTE.
>> THAT SHIP HAS SAILED LITERALLY JORCHGHTS YES, SIR, NOTHING IS WRITTEN IN STONE.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
I MEAN MAYBE THE REPUBLICANS COULD HAVE A CONFERENCE WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT OUTREACH TO
MINORITY VOTERS.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, THAT COULD HELP.
>> AND MAYBE THEY COULD HOLD THAT MINORITY OUT REACH CONFERENCE, UM, I DON'T KNOW
EARLIER THIS MONTH AT A FORMER VIRGINIA SLAVE PLANTATION!
NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> Jon: I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL SHE GOT IN HERE IT'S CALLED THE HISPANIC ROOM.
NOT YOUNG BLACK CHICK ROOM.
>> Jon: AL, WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS GOING TO GET THE VOTE?
>> MAYBE ASIANS, I DON'T KNOW FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE GAY PEOPLE IF THAT'S EVEN A THING.
OR POSSIBLY HAWAIIAN PRANKSTERS BUT LOOK, IT STILL WON'T GET THEM OVER THE TOP.
>> Jon: ROMNEY LOST THE FEMALE VOTE BY 11 POINTS CSM THEY MAKE INROADS THERE?
>> IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
I COULD SEE --
>> AGAIN, I GOT THIS.
ROLE 212-
>> IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE RAPE THE FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS WAYS TO TRY TO SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN.
>> NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
