>> Jon: WELCOME TO THEDAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOWTONIGHT.
PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, OUR OLDFRIEND DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN IS
GOING TO BE JOINING US LATER.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN IS GONNA BETALKING ABOUT PRESIDENTS.
BUT SPEAKING OF PRESIDENTS,BIG NEWS FROM YESTERDAY.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE TAKINGJON STEWART VERY SERIOUSLY.
>> "POLITICO" IS REPORTINGTHAT STEWART SECRETLY
VISISTED THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> THE PRESIDENT INVITEDSTEWART TO TWO SECRET WHITE
HOUSE MEETINGS WHEN HENEEDED MEDIA SUPPORT.
>> SECRETLY MEETING WITHPRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> SECRET MEETING.
>> HAD SECRET MEETINGS.
>> SECRETLY WORKING TOGETHERFOR YEARS.
>> Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT-- I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS--
THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH MORE AWESOMETHAN WHAT HAPPENED.
(LAUGHTER)
BASICALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES CALLED MY OFFICE
AND ASKED, TWICE, IF I WOULDCOME TO WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH
HIM, AND I DID.
(LAUGHTER)
WASN'T REALLY THAT BIG A DEAL.
I WAS BROUGHT THROUGH THE SECRETWHITE HOUSE TUNNEL ENTRANCE AT
MT. RUSHMORE.
IT WAS A ROUND TABLE MEETINGWITH THE PRESIDENT, ELVIS --
STILL ALIVE -- MINISTERFARRAKHAN AND THE AREA 51
ALIEN.
BUT I REMEMBER, WE OPENEDWITH THE TRADITIONAL
SAIL ALINKSY PRAYER, SUCKED ONTHE BLOOD OF THE RIGHTOUS AND
TOOK TURNS [BLEEP] THEREPLICA OF THE REAGAN EYE
SOCKET.
OH, WAIT, I SHOULD TELL YOU ITWAS A REPLICA.
THE REAL REAGAN EYE SOCKETIS KEPT IN THE SMITHSONIAN
AND IS ONLY [BLEEP] ONCHRISTMAS.
(LAUGHTER)
WOW!
BUT ANYWAY, THE WHOLE SECRETTHING MAKES IT SOUND SINISTER,
BUT IF YOU GUYS INSIST, IT WAS ASECRET.
>> JON STEWART WAS INVITEDINTO THE OVAL OFFICE, NOT
ONCE BUT TWICE.
SECRET MEETINGS WERE THEY?
>> WELL, NOT NECESSARILYSECRET, BECAUSE IT IS ON THE
LOG.
THEY'RE JUST KIND OF COMINGOUT NOW, STEWART, SO DEPENDS
ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
SO I GUESS IF YOU LOOKED ATIT, THEN IT'S NOT A SECRET.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LIKE IF YOU LOOKED AT ITTHAT IT WAS OPENLY LISTED AND I
WENT THROUGH THE NORMAL WHITEHOUSE ENTRANCE LIKE EVERYBODY
ELSE, AND I TOLD MY MOM WHAT IWAS DOING AND SHE TOLD HER
FRIENDS, AND HER FRIENDS ARELIKE, STILL NOT A CARDIOLOGIST.
BUT-- THE POINT IS THIS.
SOMETHING IS NOT A SECRETJUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT IT.
NOW THE SADDEST PART IS THEMEDIA HAS GOT A SERIOUS CASE
OF THE FOMO.
>> WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEYTALKED ABOUT.
>> IF ONLY YOU COULD BE AFLY ON THE WALL DURING THOSE
MEETINGS.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: LET ME TELL ISOMETHING, YOU DO NOT WANT
TO BE A FLY ANYWHERE NEARPRESIDENT OBAMA. --
>> NICE.
>> I GOT THE SUCKER. THERE ITIS.
>> Jon: BY THE WAY, THE NAMEOF THAT BUG, OSAMA BIN FLYIN.
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THEREST OF THE STORY.
SO I ASSUME THAT THEINSINUATION HERE IS, I WAS
SUMMONED TO THE WHITE HOUSESO OBAMA AND I COULD
COORDINATE ON HIS AGENDA, MAYBEPROMOTING OBAMACARE OR THE AUTO
BAILOUT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WHAT IS YOUR EVIDENCE.
>> LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENTCHATTED UP STEWART HOURS
BEFORE WARNING RUSSIAAGAINST FURTHER MILITARY
INTERVENTION IN UKRAINE.
>> AND STEWART, WHO SEEMINGLYWORKED IN CONCERT WITH THE
WHITE HOUSE, SAID THIS ON HISVERY NEXT SHOW.
>> Jon: RUSSIAN FORCES STORMINGUKRAINIAN BASE, THAT IS
BLATANT NAKED AGGRESSION ORAT THE VERY LEAST DISTURBINGLY
SHIRTLESS AGGRESSION, YEAH.
>> THE NEXT DAILY SHOW THEREWAS JON STEWART MAKING FUN
OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.
AND SO IT WORKED FROM THEWHITE HOUSE'S POINT OF VIEW.
>> INTERESTING.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
SO YOU BELIEVE AS RUSSIANTROOPS GATHERED AT THE
BORDER OF THE UKRAINE, OBAMASUMMONED ME--
(LAUGHTER)
JUST IN CASE HE NEEDED HELPTURNING YOUNG AMERICANS AGAINST
PUTIN.
SO THEN THE PRESIDENT HAD MEGO BACK IN TIME AND DO
[BLEEP] OF OTHER ANTI-PUTINHEADLINES, YEARS EARLIER
SO NOBODY WOULD SUSPECT IDIDN'T CARE FOR VLADIMIR
PUTIN.
LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU HOW THISHAPPENED.
THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TOCOME TO WASHINGTON.
AND I DID.
BECAUSE IF THE PRESIDENTTELLS YOU, AND YOU DON'T,
WHO THE [BLEEP] KNOWS WHATWOULD HAPPEN.
AND BY THE WAY, TO ALLFUTURE PRESIDENTS, IF YOU
ASK ME TO COME TO WASHINGTON,I WILL DO THAT.
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA HOWTO REACT TO THAT OTHER THAN,
WHAT TIME?
AND HERE'S HOW THE MEETINGSWENT.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
WE SPENT ABOUT FIVE TO SEVENMINUTES WITH OBAMA KIND OF
SCOLDING ME, NOT TO TURN YOUNGAMERICANS CYNICAL.
AND I SPENT ABOUT FIVE TOSEVEN MINUTES EXPLAINING TO
HIM, I'M ACTUALLY SKEPTICALLYIDEALISTIC AND SMILING LIKE
THIS.
AND THEN WE SPENT ABOUT 45MINUTES ARGUING ABOUT, REALLY,
THE VA CAN'T BE FIXED ANYQUICKER? OR HEALTHCARE.GOV
CAN'T COME ON LINE WITHOUTCRASHING MY SON'S MINECRAFT
GAME? AND THE WHOLE THINGBASICALLY TAKES PLACE OVER
SOME OF TRULY THE BESTSALOMON YOU HAVE EVER HAD.
SO REALLY, REMEMBER MYINTERVIEW WITH OBAMA LAST
WEEK, IT WAS THAT.
BUT WITH SALOMON.
IN FACT, DON'T EVEN BOTHERMANAGING IT, WE'LL DO IT FOR
YOU.
>> WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TODEMONSTRATE THE AGILITY --
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
(JON AND BARACK TALK OVER EACHOTHER)
>> THE REASON THEY ARE GOINGBACK UP, AS I TOLD YOU, YOU
HAVE 2.7 MILLION NEW FOLKSCOMING IN.
>> Jon: WELL, WHEN YOU START ALOT OF WARS... IT'S GOING TO
ADD PEOPLE.
>> HOLD ON A SECOND.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND IFTHERE ARE SOME FOLKS AT FOX WHO
ARE CONCERNED THAT ANY MEETING ITAKE WITH A POWERFUL INDIVIDUAL
SHOULD BE DISCLOSED, LEST IT BECONSIDERED POSSIBLE
COLLUSION.
LET ME SAY TELL YOU THIS, IHAVE BEEN SUMMONED BY
A SURPRISINGLY WIDE VARIETY OFINDIVIDUALS OVER THE YEARS.
FROM TECH GIANTS, TO FINANCIALCAPTAINS, TO BILLY JOEL -- TRUE.
AND THE GENERAL THRUST OFALL OF THOSE MEETINGS OR
PHONE CONVERSATIONS ARE THESAME.
BASICALLY IT'S THIS.
JON, WHY ARE YOU SUCH ANASSHOLE.
(LAUGHTER)
IT WAS TRUE OF THE MEETING WITHTHE PRESIDENT, AND IT'S BEEN
TRUE OF THE MEETINGS WITH ALLTHOSE PEOPLE.
AND THIS WOULD BE OFINTEREST TO MANY OF THEM.
IN FACT, THERE WAS ONEPARTICULAR MEETING THAT WAS
ACTUALLY SECRET, UNTIL ANINTREPID PRE-FOX HOWIE
KURTZ BLEW THE WHISTLE ONIT, WHEN I WAS SUMMONED BY
ROGER AILES TO HIS OFFICE.
JUST LIKE MY MEETING WITHTHE PRESIDENT.
EXCEPT WHERE THE PRESIDENTHAD HIS PEOPLE REACH OUT TO
ME BY PHONE, FOR THISMEETING A RAVEN WOKE ME UP
AT MIDNIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, HERE'S A QUICK SNIPPETOF WHAT THAT CONVERSATION
WAS LIKE --
>> Jon: I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ORENJOY IT BUT I'M SURE IT WAS
PROFOUND.
WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES TRYING TO
INFLUENCE OR INTIMIDATE ORFLATTER ME?
MY GUESS IS UH-HUH.
DID IT WORK?
MIGHT HAVE.
WAS IT SINISTER?
I DON'T (BLEEP) KNOW.
IN FACT, IN MY ENTIRE TENURE ATBEING YELLED AT BY INFLUENTIAL
AND POWERFUL AND INDIVIDUALS,AND BILLY JOEL--
(LAUGHTER)
ONLY, THIS IS TRUE, ONLY WITHONE OF THOSE PEOPLE HAS A PHONE
CALL EVER ENDED WITH, QUOTE,THIS CONVERSATION NEVER
HAPPENED, AND IF YOU SAY IT DID,I WILL DENY IT.
AND IT WASN'T THE [BLEEP]PRESIDENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT.
WHAT IS WILD TO ME IS JUSTHOW FAR AND QUICKLY THIS
STORY SPREAD, UNQUESTIONED.
EVEN THOUGH THE ARTICLE THATIT WAS BASED ON IF
"POLITICO" CONTAIN PRETTYBASIC FACTUAL ERRORS.
FOR INSTANCE, POLITICOREFERRED TO OUR EXECUTIVE
PRODUCER AT SCOTT BUDOW, AMAN WHO I HAVE KNOWN ALL
THIS TIME AS STEVE BODOW.
AND WHOSE NAME HAS BEEN FACTCHECKED BY OUR CREDITS EVERY
NIGHT THE SHOW AIRS.
BUT YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE SHOWIS WRONG.
