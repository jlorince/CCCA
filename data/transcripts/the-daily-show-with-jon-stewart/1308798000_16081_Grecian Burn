[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR
MITCHELL ZUCKOFF, AUTHOR OF A
NEW BOOK ON AN HEROIC WORLD WAR
II RESCUE MISSION.
AS WITH LAST NIGHT'S SHOW, I
WILL ASK HIM TO PERFORM LIVE
SURGERY ON THE SHOW.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW LAST
NIGHT.
CAMERON DIAZ SEWED UP ONE OF MY
HEMORRHOIDS.
DID YOU SEE IT?
YOU GUYS DON'T WATCH THE SHOW,
DO YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A
QUESTION.
YOU EVER BEEN JUST FED UP, TO
THE BREAKING POINT?
YOU THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT, ENOUGH
WITH THE RAT RACE, CHASING SOME
MATERIALISTIC DREAM.
I'M GOING TO CHUCK IT ALL, SELL
MY STUFF, MOVE TO A FISHING
VILLAGE, DRINK OUZO, EAT LAMB
ALL DAY AND CHARM TOURISTS WHILE
EXISTING ON A PENSIONER'S
STIPEND.
SOUNDS NICE.
AND IT IS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AN
ENTIRE COUNTRY HAD THAT IDEA?
[LAUGHTER]
AT THE SAME TIME.
I PRESENT TO YOU GREECE 2011.
>> YOUNG PROTESTERS WERE JOINED
BY THE ELDERLY, BATTLING THROUGH
TEAR GAS AND HURDLING ANYTHING
FROM INCENDIARY DEVICES TO GREEK
YOGURT.
>> YOUNG PEOPLE.
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE ELDERLY
THROWING INCENDIARY DEVICES AND
YOGURT.
[LAUGHTER]
I WONDER WHO WAS THROWING THE
INCENDIARY DEVICES AND WHO WAS
THROWING THE YOGURT.
[LAUGHTER]
THOSE RIOTERS ARE UPSET ABOUT
PROPOSED AUSTERITY MEASURES THAT
WOULD END GREEK CITIZEN BENEFITS
SUCH AS SIX PAID VACATION WEEKS
A YEAR AND RETIREMENT WITH 80%
PAY AND BENEFITS AT AGE 53.
AND WORD IS THE RIOTING MAY
SPREAD.
WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT GREEKS GET
TO RETIRE WITH 80% PAY AT 53.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW CAN GREECE AFFORD THIS?
FUNNY STORY.
>> WITH A POPULATION OF 11
MILLION, IT HAS A DEBT OF NEARLY
HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED]!
GREECE $480 BILLION DEBT FOR 11
MILLION PEOPLE.
YOU IRRESPONSIBLE CHILDREN.
THAT IS LIKE...
[LAUGHTER]
$44,000 OF DEBT PER PERSON.
DON'T GIVE ME, THAT WELL, THE
UNITED STATES HAS DEBT, TOO.
YES, YES, WE DO HAVE A $14
TRILLION DEBT, BUT WE HAVE 307
MILLION PEOPLE, SO OURS WORKS
OUT TO... WHAT'S THAT?
OH, $45,000 PER PERSON.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT WE GET TO RETIRE NEVER.
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, GREECE, HOW ARE YOU GUYS SO
GOOD WITH MONEY?
NOW, YOU MAY BE WONDERING, ASIDE
FROM THE COMICAL MENTAL IMAGE OF
OLD GREEK PEOPLE THROWING YOGURT
AT THE POLICE, WHY SHOULD WE
CARE ABOUT THE GREEK ECONOMY?
>> IN THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO,
ECONOMISTS SAY THE GREEK DEBT
CRISIS COULD BECOME EUROPE'S
LEHMAN BROTHERS, A CATASTROPHIC
FAILURE THAT FREEZES THE CREDIT
MARKETS AND INFECTS THE U.S.
ECONOMY.
>> Jon: THE U.S. ECONOMY?
BUT THAT'S WHERE WE LIVE.
[LAUGHTER]
SOMEONE, QUICK, GET ME SOME
