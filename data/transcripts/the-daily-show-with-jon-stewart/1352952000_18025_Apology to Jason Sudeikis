MY NAME IS JON STEWART.

CHER MONOHELMSLEY.
(LAUGHTER).
(LAUGHTER) HOORAY ME!
LAST NIGHT WE HAD ON THE PROGRAM JASON SUDEIKIS FROM S.N.L . A TREMENDOUS, VERY, VERY FUNNY
MAN, PLAYS MITT ROMNEY AND JOE BIDEN ON THE SHOW AND HE WAS MAKING A JOKE ON THE SHOW ABOUT
HOW WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF IN THIS ELECTION IT TURNED OUT THAT ROMNEY AND BIDEN HAD BOTH WON
AND ENDED UP AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT, WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN FUNNY AND I SAID, OH,
I DON'T THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN, JASON.
AS A MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT LIKE -- AND HE'S LIKE "WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE SCENARIO.
WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT COULD HAPPEN!
HE WAS REFERRING TO A SCENARIO WHICH I FOUND OUT LATER WHERE IF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WAS TIED
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN KICKED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHERE THEY MIGHT
HAVE PICKED MITT ROMNEY, THE SENATE WOULD HAVE PICKED THE VICE PRESIDENT, THEY WOULD HAVE
PICKED JOE BIDEN AND THAT'S HOW IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
ONCE AGAIN THERE'S -- ONE OF THE THINGS I HATE THE MOST ABOUT ME -- (LAUGHTER).
IS HOW MUCH (BLEEP) I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER) EVERYDAY THERE IS (BLEEP) THAT I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER) AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, TELEVISION IS -- IF YOU'RE EVER LOOKING TO DISPLAY YOUR
IGNORANCE -- (LAUGHTER).
WHAT A MEDIUM!
(LAUGHTER) SO JASON SUDEIKIS, I APOLOGIZE.
HE JUST WALKED OUT AND I WAS UP UNTIL 3:00 IN THE MORNING
