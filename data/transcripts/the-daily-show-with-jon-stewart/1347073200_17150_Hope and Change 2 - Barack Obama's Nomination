BUT OF COURSE THE MANY ATTRACTION, THE MAN HIMSELF.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-- NO, NOT THAT ONE.
NO.
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT!
THERE HE IS, THE POTUS WITH THE MOSTEST BARACK "WE DON'T USUALLY
USE HIS MIDDLE NAME" OBAMA, THE WORLD WATCHED WITH BATED BREATH.
>> I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, THANK GOD,
I WAS SO SURE HE WAS GOING TO BREAK UP WITH US.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD!
HE STILL THINKS WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.
SO AMERICA SAT DOWN, LEANED FORWARD AND WAITED TO SEE IF HE WOULD DELIVER THAT OLD OBAMA MAGIC.
>> WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A C.E.O.
PAYS HIS AUTO WORKERS ENOUGH TO BUY THE CARS THAT THEY BUILT,
THE WHOLE COMPANY DOES BETTER.
WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A FAMILY CAN NO LONGER BE TRICKED INTO SIGNING A MORTGAGE THEY CAN'T
AFFORD, THAT FAMILY'S PROTECTED,
BUT SO IS THE VALUE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES.
WE BELIEVE THE LITTLE GIRL WHO IS OFFERED AN ESCAPE FROM POVERTY BY A GREAT TEACHER ON A
GRANT FOR COLLEGE COULD BECOME NEXT STEVE JOBS.
>> Jon: ♪♪ WE BELIEVE WE CAN FLY  ♪ ♪ HE HAD IT AGAIN.
BUT EVERY MOMENT OF SOARING RHETORIC WAS TEMPERED WITH A MORE SOBER REALITY.
>> I WON'T PRETEND THE PATH I AM OFFERING IS QUICK OR EASY.
I NEVER HAVE.
>> Jon: ♪♪ WE BELIEVE WE CAN FLY.  .
BUT OBVIOUSLY FLYING CARRIES WITH IT SOME INHERENT RISK.
IN 2008, CANDIDATE OBAMA PAINTED A BEAUTIFUL AND VIVID PICTURE THAT NO ARTIST COULD HAVE
BROUGHT TO LIFE.
MUCH IN THE WAY WHEN YOU GO TO A GOLDEN CORAL, THE BEAUTIFUL CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.
(  LAUGHTER  ) OF TELEVISION FAME IS REALLY
JUST AN OPEN SEWER PIPE OF SUBPAR FUDGE.
(  LAUGHTER  ) BUT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE.
THIS WAS THE CHALLENGE 2012 OBAMA FACED.
>> OURS IS A FIGHT TO RESTORE THE VALUES THAT BUILT THE LARGEST MIDDLE CLASS AND THE
STRONGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: ♪♪ I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY.
>> THE TRUTH IS, IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A FEW YEARS FOR US TO
SOLVE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BUILT UP IN DECADES.
>> Jon: DID I SAY SKY?
I MEANT THE SHELF WHERE I KEEP THE JUICE BOXES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YES, THE CHALLENGE FOR THE PRESIDENT WAS TO REPLACE THE AUDACITY OF HOPE WITH THE MORE
REASONABLE CALIBRATION OF EXPECTATION.
AND THEN, ULTIMATELY, LEST WE STILL BELIEVE TOO FERVENTLY IN THE POWER OF ONE MAN.
>> SO, YOU SEE, THE ELECTION FOUR YEARS AGO WASN'T ABOUT ME.
IT WAS ABOUT YOU.
( APPLAUSE ) MY FELLOW CITIZENS, YOU WERE THE CHANGE.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERING )
>> Jon:  THIS IS LIKE AN M KNIGHT SHAMADDAN MOVIE.
I BET IF WE GO BACK AND WATCH THE ELECTION AGAIN, WE'LL PICK UP ALL THE CLUES.
>> YOU'RE THE RELATIONSHIP THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL WITH A
HEART DISORDER IN PHOENIX WHO WILL GET THE SURGERY SHE NEEDS BECAUSE AN INSURANCE COMPANY
CAN'T LIMIT HER COVERAGE.
YOU DID THAT.
>> Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME?
( LAUGHTER )
>> YOU'RE THE REASON A YOUNG MAN IN COLORADO WHO NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D BE ABLE TO AFFORD HIS DREAM OF EARNING A MEDICAL DEGREE IS ABOUT TO GET THAT CHANCE.
YOU MADE THAT POSSIBLE.
>> Jon:  I'M AWESOME.
. LAUGH  ( APPLAUSE )
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW THIS DRIFT.
YOU DID THE GOOD THING.
YOU DID THE GOOD THING.
NOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO THROW US UNDER THE BUS FOR ALL THE ( BLEEP ) STUFF THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE.
HOW ABOUT THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS?
YOU DID THAT!
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, AUDIENCE!
DOESN'T FEEL SO GOOD WHEN YOU GET BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING, DOES IT!
( LAUGHTER ) MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
>> WE, THE PEOPLE, RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS RIGHTS.
THAT AMERICA IS NOT ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR US.
IT'S ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE BY US TOGETHER.
THROUGH THE HARD AND FRUADMINISTRATING, BUT NECESSARY WORK OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: HARD, NECESSARY,
FRUSTRATING, RESPONSIBILITIES.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE IT WAS TIME FOR US TO BE BROUGHT DOWN TO EARTH A LITTLE BIT ANYWAY.
AND MAYBE THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD HAVE DONE IT WAS THE ONE WHO PUT ALL THAT AIR UNDER OUR
FEET IN THE FIRST PLACE.
(  LAUGHTER  )
