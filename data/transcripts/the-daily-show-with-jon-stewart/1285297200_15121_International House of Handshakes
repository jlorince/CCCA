>> Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
I WAS JUST MAKING SOME FINAL
NOTES.
[LAUGHTER]
WHEN A SPECIAL SHOW WE HAVE FOR
YOU TONIGHT HIS MAJESTY KING
ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN WILL BE
JOINING US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
TRULY AN HONOR.
HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OR
AS I CALLED HIM -- AND I'M NOT
TRYING TO BRAG -- HIS MAJESTY
KING ABDULLAH II.
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S IN TOWN FOR THE 56th
GENERAL ASSEMBLY KICKING OFF
TODAY BY THE SECRET KENYAN
ADVISOR OF THESE UNITED STATES
WHO SPOKE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.
>> PEACE MUST BE MADE ABOUT IT
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS BUT WE
HAVE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO
OUR PART AS WELL.
THOSE OF US WHO ARE FRIENDS OF
ISRAEL MUST UNDERSTAND THAT TRUE
SECURITY FOR THE JEWISH STATE
REQUIRE AS AN INDEPENDENT
PALESTINE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I KNOW WE ARE NOT
NECESSARILY A TALL PEOPLE BUT --
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT -- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT?
THEY ARE NOT EVEN THERE!
ISRAEL IS NOT EVEN THERE.
UNLESS OH, MY GOD THEY SENT
ELIJAH.
NO?
THEY SENT ELIJAH AND HIS FRIEND
THE INVISIBLE MENCH.
THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH ABOUT
THE MIDDLE EAST IN YEARS AND
ISRAEL DOESN'T SHOW.
THEY WERE NOT THERE IN OBVIOUS
OBVIOUS -- OBSERVANCE OF THE
JEWISH HOLIDAY OF SUKOT WITH THE
HUT AND YOU SHAKE THE LEMON AND
YOU LICK -- I'M JEWISH I DIDN'T
KNOW -- I THOUGHT IT WAS JEWISH
ARBOR DAY.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M ACTUALLY TOLD JEWISH ARBOR
DAY IS CALLED TUBASHOT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF HOLIDAYS.
[LAUGHTER]
I GUESS THAT'S THE THING ABOUT
BEING A 6,000 YEAR OLD RELIGION,
A CONSUME LATE THE HOLIDAYS.
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
[LAUGHTER]
ISRAEL DOESN'T SHOW UP TO A
SPEECH THAT WAS BASICALLY FOR
THEIR BENEFIT WHILE OTHER
COUNTRIES TURNED UP EVEN THOUGH
THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GET
ROASTED.
>> TYRANNY IS STILL WITH US
WHETHER IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A
NORTH KOREAN REGIME THAT
ENSLAVES ITS OWN PEOPLE OR AN
ARMED GROUP IN CONGO THAT USE
RAPE AS A WANE OF WAR.
>> Jon: HELLO.
WE'RE SITTING RIGHT HERE.
HELLO, WE HEAR YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
THOSE GUYS FROM THE CONGO LOOK
BAD ASS.
BY THE WAY, HOW DO YOU LIKE TO
BE COSTA RICA.
EVERY U.N. ASSEMBLY
ALPHABETICALLY IS SITTING NEXT
TO THE CONGO.
EVERY TIME YOU SHOW UP AT THE
U.N. YOU GO HEY.
WHAT IS UP, YOU USE RAPE AS
WEAPONS.
WE'RE MORE OF AN ECOTOURIST KIND
OF THING.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT OBAMA WAS NOT ONLY THE BIG
NAME SPEAKER.
THERE WAS ALSO IRANIC PRESIDENT
MAHMOUD AHMEDINEJAD.
HE WARMED UP FOR HIS SPEECH AT
THE U.N. BY GOING ON CHARLIE
ROSE AND EXPLAINING WHY THE ILL
FEELINGS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES
IS NOT HIS FAULT.
>> WHEN MR. OWE BALM KWRAFS
VOLED INTO OFFICE I SENT HIM A
MESSAGE.
I CONGRATULATED HIM.
OKAY?
WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE
LOGICALLY?
HE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST
RESPONDED.
I COME INTO THE ROOM AND I SAY
HELLO TO YOU.
YOU CAN TURN AROUND AND SAY
HELLO TO THE OTHER PERSON NEXT
TO ME.
>> POINT WELL TAKEN.
>> Jon: POINT WELL TAKEN?
YOU ARE MAD AT US BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T SAY HELLO?
THAT'S YOUR GRUDGE?
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HATE JEWS.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE ONE OF
US.
[LAUGHTER]
I USED TO GET THE SAME THING
FROM MY RELATIVES.
THAT'S HOW MY RELATIVES ACT.
LOOK AT YOU MR. DEATH TO SMOOCIE
CAN'T COME TO HIS UNCLE'S 71ST
BIRTHDAY PARTY.
I'M NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU?
MAYBE I'M NOT DANNY DE VITO BUT
DID I RIDICULE YOU AT YOUR BAR
MITZVAH.
I CAN'T EVEN -- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS GUY.
I MEAN IT'S -- WHAT REASON WOULD
PRESIDENT OBAMA OR ANY OTHER
AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAVE TO BE
ANYTHING LESS THAN BEST FRIENDS
WITH AHMEDINEJAD?
>> I WARNED AMERICA AND ENGLAND
THAT THE FLAMES OF NATION'S
WRATH IS RISING.
THE ZIONIST REGIME AND ITS
CRIMES AND THE RAGE OF THE
REGIONS NATIONS IS ERUPTING.
WE'LL BREAK YOUR STICKS DOWN.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THIS
NATION WILL STAND UP AND WILL
SLAP THE MALEVOLENT ON THE
MOUTH.
>> Jon: I DENY THE HOLOCAUST.
I SAY THAT YOU, AMERICA,
ORCHESTRATED 9/11, BUT I WOULD
NEVER NOT SAY HELLO.
