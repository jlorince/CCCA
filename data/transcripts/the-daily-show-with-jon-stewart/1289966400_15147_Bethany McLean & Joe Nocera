>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUESTS TONIGHT ONE WRITES FOR
VANITY FAIR ONE WRITES FOR THE
FORECAST IN.
THEY'VE COAUTHOR A NEW BOOK
CALLED "ALL THE DEVILS ARE HERE:
THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF FINANCIAL
CRISIS."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW
BETHANY MCLEAN AND JOE NOCERA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO SEE YOU.
COME AND SIT.
COME, COME, COME.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU GUYS BOTH FOR COMING
BACK TO SEE US.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "ALL THE
DEVILS ARE HERE.
MENT THE HIDDEN -- THE HIDDEN
HISTORY OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.
I HAVE TO SAY TO YOUR CREDIT THE
HISTORY OF FINANCIAL KRAOEUS
SKWREUS NO LONGER HIDDEN.
YOU HAVE LAID IT OUT IN ALMOST
EXCRUCIATING DETAIL FROM START
TO FINISH IN A REALLY CONCISE
AND CLARIFYING MANNER.
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO STARE INTO
THE HEART OF DARKNESS?
>> IT WASN'T THAT BAD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, THE LUNG OF
DARKNESS.
>> IT GOT US MAD.
YOU KNOW, WE WERE KIND OF MAD
BEFORE AND WE DID THIS REPORTING
AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THE
SUBPRIME, LOUSY SUBPRIME STUFF,
THE WAY WALL STREET EGGED THEM
ON.
I WAS A LOT MADDER WHEN I FINISH
ED THAN WHEN I STARTED.
>> Jon: I WAS A LOT MADDER
WHEN I FINISHED AS WELL.
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL A BIG
ACCIDENT.
AFTER I FINISH THE REPORTING I
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ALL A BIG
ACCIDENT.
>> Jon: TIME MACHINE, BETHANY
MCLEAN, YOU FIRST THING DO YOU,
GO BACK AND KILL HITLER, SECOND
THING.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT IS THE ONE RECIPE, ONE
INGREDIENT IN THE RECIPE FOR
FINANCIAL DISASTER THAT YOU
CHANGE, THE MOST CRUCIAL
INGREDIENT THAT YOU THINK
TRIGGERED THIS FINANCIAL
COLLAPSE?
>> I WOULD HAVE THE FED LISTEN
TO THE CONSUMER ADVOCATES WHO
STARTED WARNING IN THE 1990'S
THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTINGEN WILLS
THEY COULD NEVER AFFORD TO PAY
BACK AND I WOULD HAVE HAD
REGULATORS IN WASHINGTON DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
>> I WOULD HAVE REGULATED DERIVE
ACTIVES AND MAYBE NOT ALLOWED
CREDIT DEFAULT.
>> Jon: SUBPRIME HAS BEEN THE
BIG CRIMINAL HERE.
BUT CREDIT DEFAULT SLOTS.
THAT TURNED WHAT WAS YOUR
STANDARD RUN OF THE MILL
TERRIBLE FINANCIAL DECISIONS
INTO A GLOBAL CATASTROPHE BUT
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO -- WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS EARLIER.
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ALLOWED
PEOPLE TO MAKE BETSES ON LOANS
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
THEM.
MY PREMISE TO YOU GUYS IS THAT
THIS WASN'T A FAILURE OF PEOPLE
UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS, THIS WAS A FAILURE
OF PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING
GAMBLING, THAT THE REASON THAT
WE FAILED IS BECAUSE THE
FINANCIAL INDUSTRY, THEIR BAD
GAMBLERS.
>> MOST ARE THEM ARE AS IT TURNS
OUT.
MERRILL LUNCH -- LYNCH WAS BAD.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE GOLDMAN SACHS
WHICH FIGURED OUT THAT, YOU
KNOW, THEY WERE ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE BET AND GOT ON THE
RIGHT SIDE IN TIME.
THEY DID IT BY SCREWING THEIR
OWN CLIENTS BUT THAT'S A WHOLE
OTHER STORY.
>> Jon: SO THE HERO IN THIS
CASE --
>> EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: EXPLAIN THAT FURTHER.
THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ARE
PEOPLE BASICALLY BETTING ON
WHETHER OR NOT THESE LOANS WILL
BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.
>> CORRECT.
>> Jon: AND THE CENTRAL THESIS
WAS REAL ESTATE WILL NEVER GO
DOWN.
>> HAD NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THE
GREAT DEPRESSION, CAN NEVER
HAPPEN, END OF STORY.
>> Jon: THEY CREATED A SIDE
BET WHERE THE MONEY WENT TO THE
OVER.
>> CORRECT.
>> Jon: SPEAKING OF SOMEONE
WHO HAS DABBLED IN THE GAMBLING
ARTS?
>> REALLY.
>> Jon: NO BOOKIE IN THE WORLD
LAYS OFF ALL HIS BETS ON ONE
SIDE WITHOUT SPREADING A LITTLE
BIT OF THIS OR LAYS OUT SO MUCH
MONEY THAT IF THE CALL COMES HE
CAN'T PAY IT.
HOW DOES THAT GROUP THINK TAKE
HOLD?
IS IT THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT'S GAMBLING?
>> THAT'S WHY OUR FAVORITE LINE
IN THE BOOK IS A MERRILL LYNCH
RISK MANAGER SAYING WE FELL FOR
OUR OWN SCAM.
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE KEEPING
THE GOOD STUFF AND SECOND THE
BAD STUFF TO OTHER PEOPLE.
THAT HE THOUGHT WHEN THE
CALAMITY CAME IT WOULD BE OTHER
PEOPLE PAYING THE PRICE NOT
THEM.
WALL STREET DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THEY WOULD PAY THE PRICE TOO.
>> Jon: WHO DID THEY THINK
WOULD PAY THE PRICE?
>> THE IDIOTIC CLIENTS THEY WERE
SELLING THIS STUFF.
>> Jon: THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY
US.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IF THEY ARE JUST
MIDDLEMEN MOVING AROUND MONEY
WHY ISN'T THEIR PROFIT JUST THE
VIG?
WHY IS IT THAT THEY ARE MAKING
MONEY THAT IS NOT JUST
TRANSACTIONAL MONEY?
>> WELL BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN
POINT.
THIS IS WHY SOME OF THE FIRMS
BLEW UP.
AT A CERTAIN POINT THEY RAN OUT
OF CLIENTS TO SILT TOO.
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE MACHINE
GOING, THIS IS WHAT THE AAA, THE
SAFEST, SAFEST TRIPLE AS.
THEY HAD TO PUT THEM ON THEIR
OWN BOOKS.
>> Jon: THEY INFECTED
THEMSELVES.
AT THE END OF IT THEY BECAME --
>> THE TRIPLE B'S WILL LOSE
MONEY BUT THE TRIPLE A'S WILL BE
SAFE.
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO THEM.
WE'LL BE INSULATED FROM THE
PROBLEM.
>> Jon: THIS THEORY ON THE
FINANCIAL CRISIS IT OCCURRED
BECAUSE OF AN IDIOT SHORTAGE.
IF IF WE HAD ONLY BEEN ABLE
TO -- LET ME TAKE THE ROLE OF
THE FED HERE.
IF I'M THE FED I JUST PRINT MORE
IDIOTS.
>> IF YOU COULD FIND MORE PEOPLE
WHO WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ALL THE
STUFF WALL STREET WAS PRODUCING
THEY COULD HAVE KEPT KEEPING THE
FEES OR THE VIG THEN THE BAD
STUFF WOULD HAVE GONE TO US.
>> Jon: ULTIMATELY WHIT HIT
THE FAN -- BUT SEE THE CREDIT
DEFAULT SWAPS THAT ONLY BECAME
LEGAL IN THE 1990'S, YES?
>> THEY WERE INVENTED IN THE
90s.
>> Jon: IN THE OLD DAYS ITS
BUCKET SHOPS IN THE 20s AND
THINGS WALL STREET USED TO HAVE
SIDE BETS.
AND THEY MADE THAT ILLEGAL IN
THE 20s.
>> ALONG WITH OTHER STUFF THEY
DID.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
DOESN'T CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP
BRING BACK THE LEGALITY OF SIDE
BETS?
>> SURE, YES.
>> BUT IT'S INNOVATION.
>> Jon: IN TODAY'S PARLANCE
GAMBLING IS ACTUALLY INNOVATION.
>> YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND CLIENTS ARE
ACTUALLY IDIOTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF I MAY --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO?
>> PRETTY MUCH.
>> Jon: WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR
BECAUSE THIS IS -- IT MUST BE --
THIS IS A COMPLEX WORLD AND TO
HAVE SOMEBODY OUTSIDE OF IT
LAYING OUT THEORIES COULD BE
FRUSTRATING.
DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES
TO HANG AROUND.
WE'LL TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
WE'LL PUT THE REST OF THE
DISCUSSION ON THE WEB FOR TEN
MINUTES.
I WANT TO FIND OUT IF I'M
MISSING SOMETHING.
I FEEL LIKE I MUST BE MISSING
SOMETHING BECAUSE IF I'M NOT,
AND I HAVE A WORD THAT I'VE
ACTUALLY JOINED CALLED CLUSTER
(bleep).
[LAUGHTER]
ALL THE DEVILS ARE HERE.
YOU HAVE TO GET THIS.
IT JUST LAYS OUT IN EXCRUCIATING
DETAIL EXACTLY.
YOU WILL READ IT AND LIKE THE
AUTHORS, YOU WILL
