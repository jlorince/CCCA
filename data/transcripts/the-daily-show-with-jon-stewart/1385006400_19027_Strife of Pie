[LAUGHTER]A LITTLE WHILE BACK ON THE
PROGRAM I PERSONALLY DON'T WATCHIT, I THINK IT'S CRASS.
[ LAUGHTER ]I MAY HAVE MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT CHICAGO-STYLE PIZZA ANDHOW IT TENDED TO BE LESS
PIZZA-ISH THAN PIZZA.
I WAS GESTICULATING QUITE ABIT DURING THAT CLIP.
IN ARTICULATING THAT SENTIMENT,I MAY HAVE IMPLIED THAT DEEP
DISH PIZZA TASTES LIKE A STRINGCHEESE THAT HAD BEEN BAKED FOR
TWO HOURS INSIDE OF MIKE DITKA'SASS.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO I SAID THAT ON A -- MY
PROGRAM AND APPARENTLY CHICAGOHAS TELEVISION.
[LAUGHTER][CHICAGOANS ARE NO DOUBT TAKING
PERSONAL OFFENSE TO THE"THE DAILY SHOW" HOST'S
JON STEWART'S RANT AGAINSTOUR DEEP DISH PIZZA.

BEST.

[LAUGHTER]I'M LATE AND I NEED TO KNOW IF I
NEED TO WEAR A COAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]ANYWAY, SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT
MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE PIZZADIALOG WAS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL
REASONED.
>> JON STEWART WENT ON A RANT.

YOU ARE RIGHT.
IT IS SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED.
IF I WAS RANTING -- WELL, IDON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY IT WAS
NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT PEOPLEON TWITTER WERE RANTING BACK.
LIKE (bleep) YOU JONSTEWART FOR SAYING DEEP DISH
PIZZA ISN'T PIZZA, DIE.
[ LAUGHTER ]THAT PARTICULAR TWITTER USER
DID NOT SPECIFY THE METHODBY WHICH I SHOULD DIE BUT I ONLY
ASSUME IT WOULD BE POISONING BYDEEP DISH PIZZA.

AND FORTH YOU KNOW CHICAGO MAYORRAHM EMMANUEL IS GETTING
INVOLVED.
THIS IS THE GIFT THAT RAHMEMMANUEL SENT TO JON
STEWART ON "THE DAILY SHOW".

HE DIDN'T WANT THE PIZZA BUT IHAVE SEEN THAT DOG EAT NOT ONLY
GARBAGE BUT HAPPILY SPEND HISENTIRE DAY WITH HIS NOSE IN
ANOTHER DOG'S BUTT HOLE.
