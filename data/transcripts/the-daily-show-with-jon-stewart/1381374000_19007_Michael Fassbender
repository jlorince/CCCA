COUPLE OF CHARACTERS THINKING HEWAS GOING TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY
DRUGGED HIM AND ENDED UP WAKINGUP IN CHAINS AND SHIPPED
DOWN TO THE SOUTH AND SPENT 12YEARS IN SLAVERY.
>> Jon: AND IT IS NOT INANYWAY WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER A
HOLLYWOOD REPRESENTATION. IT ISAA
STARK REALITY -- REPRESENTATION.
IT'S A STARK REALITY, DIFFICULTAT TIMES TO WATCH BUT INCREDIBLY
WELL DONE.
>> I REALLY THINK STEVE HAS MADEA MASTER WORK HERE.
>> Jon: STEVE McQUEEN, JUSTA PHENOMENAL FILMMAKER.
>> POWERFUL.
IT'S NOT PULLING ANY PUNCHES BUTIT'S NOT ALSO TRYING TO HYPE
ANYTHING UP.
IT IS AS IT WAS.
>> Jon: DO PEOPLE STAY AWAYFROM YOU ON SET?
I'M CURIOUS, SOME OF THE THINGSTHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ARE
OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY PHYSICALLYDEMANDING.
>> I COULDN'T GO METHOD ON THIS>>ONE BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR ISIS
BLACK.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I COULD SEE THAT THAT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT.

>> SOMETIMES, YEAH.
WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH HEAVYMATERIAL IT'S NICE AND NECESSARY
TO HAVE LIGHT MOMENTS IN BETWEENSO IT DOESN'T BECOME ALL THE
TIME JUST SO SORT OF HEAVY ANDYOU KIND OF GET MAYBE A LITTLE
BIT SORT OF BLINKERED ON IT.
THE MOMENTS WHERE YOU CAN FINDRELIEF AND RESPITE YOU DO.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE READ THESCRIPT.
WHEN YOU ARE IN IT, WHEN YOUWATCH IT, DOES IT HAVE THE
POWER.
I WATCHED IT.
I MAY HAVE -- THERE MIGHT HAVEBEEN SOME ACRID DUST IN MY
OFFICE WHILE I WAS WATCHING ITWHICH CREATED A CERTAIN -- I
THINK AN AUTONOMIC RESPONSE.
>> THAT AND THE ONIONS.
>> Jon: THAT AND I WEAR A SUITOF ONIONS IN MY OFFICE.
IT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL ANDMOVING AT TIMES.
DO YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO ENJOYIT AS A VIEWER HAVING BEEN A
PART OF IT.
DID IT STILL HAVE THE POWER TOYOU WHEN I WATCHED IT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE FIRST TIME I GOT THE SCRIPTIT WAS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IN
TEARS AT THE END OF IT.
IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STORYAND SUCH AN IMPORTANT ONE.
I REALLY WANTED TO BE PART OF ITAND TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF IT.
I SAW IT -- I'VE ONLY SEEN ITONCE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
TELLURIDE IN COLORADO AT THEFILM FESTIVAL THERE. I WASHE
REALLY QUITE SPEECHLESS AT THEEND OF IT.
>> Jon: HOW DOES ANAUDIENCE -- IN AMERICA,
OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE NOT FROM THISCOUNTRY BUT OBVIOUSLY SLAVERY AS
MUCH AS WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEENTAUGHT THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND THAT THE WAR WAS BASICALLY
JUST A COTTON PRICING ISSUE.
HOW DOES AN AMERICAN AUDIENCEWATCH IT BECAUSE IT IS AN
ABSOLUTELY MIRROR IN THE FACE OFA DARK TIME IN OUR HISTORY BUT
ONE THAT WE OURSELVES LIVED WITHFOR 100 YEARS.
WHAT IS AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE,HOW DO THEY RESPOND?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW LIKE HISTORYTEACHERS THAT, YOU KNOW WE'RE
ALL MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AND ITHINK IT'S A UNIVERSAL STORY.
YOU KNOW, SLAVERY WAS A PROBLEMNOT ONLY HERE BUT MIGHT HAVE
TAKEN A LITTLE BIT LONGER FOR ITTO BE ABOLISHED BUT SOMETHING
GOING ON IN THE UK AND BRITAINAND THE BELGIANS IN THE CONGO.
THIS IS A UNIVERSAL STORY.
AMERICA IS MADE UP OF LOTS OFDIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND THAT IS
WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
IT WASN'T OUR FAULT.
AS I WAS SAYING TO YOU --(bleep) BRITAIN.
>> THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOREVERYTHING.
>> Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT'S -- IT'S PHENOMENAL WORK.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Jon: EXCELLENT.
I URGE PEOPLE TO GO CHECK IT OUTAS SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING ON
SOMETHING MYSELF, WHAT ATERRIBLE IDEA TO WATCH HOW GOOD
THIS IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
YOURS.
