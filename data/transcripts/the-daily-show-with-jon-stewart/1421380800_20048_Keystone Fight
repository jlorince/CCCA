>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VEGOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SIENNA MILLERIS GOING TO BE JOINING US.
BUT FIRSTI WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS
SOMETHING -- BOOM!
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU MAY NOT REALIZE THIS, I
COLLECT WRISTS!
(LAUGHTER)I'M A WRISTOLOGIST!
(LAUGHTER)I MET A DUDE -- I HAVE BEEN
DOING THIS SHOW NOW, 93 YEARS.
NEVER MET A DUDE WEARING A BUNCHOF WATCHES WHO SAYS TO ME, I
JUST ASKED YOU BECAUSE I'M AHOROLOGIST.
I DON'T -- COME VISIT US,TICKETS ARE FREE.
(LAUGHTER)LET'S GET INTO THE PROGRAM.
FIRST, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGSTHAT ARE FOREVER.
DIAMONDS.
BATMAN.
AND, AT THIS POINT, THE DEBATEOVER THE
KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE.
>> FOR SIX YEARS, THE DEBATEOVER THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE
HAS OFTEN DOMINATED BELTWAYPOLITICS.
>> IF IT'S EVER BUILT, THEPIPELINE WILL CARRY CRUDE
EXTRACTED FROM THE TARSANDS OF ALBERTA
CANADA SOME 1,700 MILES TONEBRASKA, BUT IT HAS BEEN
STALLED FOR SIX YEARS AT THECANADIAN BORDER AWAITING THE
PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL.
>> Jon: OH!
POOR LONELY PIPELINE!
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE OILDOESN'T JUST GO AROUND AMERICA
THIS WAY AND JUST SNEAK IN FROMTHE MEXICAN SIDE.
APPARENTLY, WE DON'T EVENPATROL THAT AREA!
(LAUGHTER)BUT OBVIOUSLY THE
KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS ANINCREDIBLY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE.
I IMAGINE THE NEW CONGRESS ISGONNA WANT TO PUT AN ISSUE LIKE
THIS ON ICE FOR A BIT ANDSTART SMALL WITH SOME OTHER
LESS DIVISIVE LEGISLATION.
>> FIRST ITEM UP IN THE NEWSENATE WILL BE THE KEYSTONE XL
PIPELINE.
>> I CAN CONFIRM FOR YOU THAT IFTHIS BILL PASSES THIS CONGRESS,
THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T SIGN IT.
>> Jon: GONNA BE A FUN TWOYEARS!
(LAUGHTER)WELL, FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO
IS POKE YOU IN THE CHEST!
WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU THEPRESIDENT WILL BREAK YOUR
(BLEEP) FINGERS.
(LAUGHTER)SO HERE WE GO.
WE HAVE AN IMPASSE.KEYSTONE PIPELINE,
IT'S BEEN LASTING OVER HALF ADECADE!
I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU, FORSOMETHING TO GET THIS
CONTENTIOUS, TO LAST THISLONG, IT HAS GOT TO BE SOME
SPECIAL PIPELINE.
I ASSUME THE FIRST OF ITS KIND.
>> CANADA ALREADY HAS AT LEASTFOUR MAJOR PIPELINES FROM
ALBERTA, DELIVERING CRUDE TOU.S. MARKETS.
THAT, OF COURSE, DOES NOTINCLUDE A SLEW OF SECONDARY
PIPELINES THAT CROSS THE BORDERINTO STATES LIKE MONTANA,
WYOMING AND COLORADO.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I NEVER
REALIZED AMERICA LOOKED SOMUCH LIKE MY AUNT'S LEGS.
(LAUGHTER)SO THE -- THAT'S NOT EVEN THAT
OLD OF A LEG, IS IT? AND THAT'SACTUALLY QUITE PRETTY.
THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE A TATTOOREALLY THAN VARICOSE VEINS,
I'D HAVE TO SAY.
(LAUGHTER)SO THE FACT THAT KEYSTONE IS A
PIPELINE CAN'T BE WHY THIS ISSUEIS SO CONTENTIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
IT'S, IT'S -- THEY'RE LAUGHING.
BEFORE I TALKED TO THEHOROLOGIST, SOMEONE IN THE
AUDIENCE WHO WAS A CROSSBETWEEN BRADLEY COOPER
AND SEAN PENN TOLD ME THAT ISLAP THE DESK EVERY TIME I ASK A
QUESTION, WHICH I HAD NOTREALIZED BECAUSE I'VE ONLY
BEEN HERE FOR 17 YEARS AND ISO I JUST DID IT JUST NOW AND
THEY RESPOND BY LAUGHING AT ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HERE'S MY PROBLEM -- I DON'T
ACTUALLY WATCH THE SHOW, SO IDON'T KNOW.
BUT GETTING BACK TO THEPIPELINE, THE PIPELINE CAN'T BE
THE ISSUE. I THINKTHE ISSUE IS BECAUSE
THE KEYSTONE WOULD BETHE FIRST PIPELINE TO TRANSPORT
CANADIAN TAR SANDS, THEFILTHIEST OF THE OILS!
>> Jon: THE RECENT ONE CALLEDTHE ALBERTA CLIPPER
TAKES A HUGE VOLUME OF OILSANDS OIL DOWN TO CHICAGO
REFINERIES.
>> Jon: WOAH. SETTING ASIDE THATYOU NAMED A SUPPOSEDLY SAFE
PIPELINE AFTER A FAST MOVINGWEATHER FRONT THAT QUICKLY AND
SEVERLY THAT RUINS YOUR CITY'SLIVABILITY, THE TAKEAWAY IS WE
ALREADY HAVE A COUNTRYCRISSCROSSED WITH CANADIAN OIL
PIPELINES INCLUDING THOSEBRINGING THE DREADED
TAR SAND OIL.
SO WHY HAS THIS PIPELINE BECOMEA BATTLE GROUND?
>> KEYSTONE BECAME A BIGPOLITICAL ISSUE SOMETIME
IN 2011.
>> ENVIRONMENTALISTS KINDOF ADOPTED KEYSTONE.
AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORKTO ELEVATE IT AS A SYMBOL.
>> WE WILL NOT LET YOUBUILD-THIS-PIPE-LINE!
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVETO GO WITH THE FIRST CHANT YOU
THINK OF.
(STILTED CHANT)"WE DO NOT SUP-PORT THE
KEY-STONE X-L PIPE-LINE.
(LAUGHTER)BE-CAUSE WE THINK IT IS VE-RY
BAD FOR THE EN VI. RON. MENT!
(DEEP BREATH)(LAUGHTER)
AND IT WILL NOT CRE-ATE THE JOBSTHAT BACK-ERS CLAIM IT WILL...
(LAUGHTER)SO SOME ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS
GOT INVOLVED.
WELL, WHAT CAN THEY DO?
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, QUITE A BIT.
BEFORE THEIR INVOLVEMENT A TARSAND PIPELINE PROJECT LIKE THE
ALBERTA CLIPPER SAILED THROUGHCONGRESS AND THE STATE
DEPARTMENT LIKE ALBERTA CLIPPERSWITH NO CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE,
BUT NOW THAT ENVIRONMENTALISTSCALLED ATTENTION TO IT, BOTH
SIDES MUST DIG IN WITH THEIRMOST PERSUASIVE RHETORIC.
FIRST THE RIGHT.
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BUILDINGTHE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED,
THINK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANTTHAT IS FOR THE SECURITY OF OUR
COUNTRY.
>> ENERGY INDEPENDENCE PROVIDESECONOMY SECURITY FROM THE THREAT
OF TERRORISM BY ORGANIZATIONSTHAT POSE IMMINENT THREATS TO
OUR NATION LIKE ISIL.
>> Jon: IF WE DON'T BUILD THISPIPELINE, THE TERRORISTS WIN.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: BUT IF WE DO --
DEMOCRATS.
>> MISERY FOLLOWS THE TAR SANDS.
I THINK XL STANDS FOR EXTRALETHAL.
BILLOWING BLACK CLOUDS HAVECONTAMINATED OUR CHILDREN.
>> Jon: OUR CHILDREN!
LOOK AT OUR CHILDREN!
THIS IS WHAT PIPELINES HAVE DONETO THEM!
THEY'RE SO CONTAMINATED!
WE SHOULD SEAL THEM UP IN A DRUMAND BURY THEM UNDER NEVADA!
START WITH SOME NEW KIDS.
SO, THE TRUTH IS, THIS COUNTRYALREADY HAS MARIO BROTHER LEVELS
OF PIPINESS
ADDING THE KEYSTONE XL TO THEMIX WOULD BE LIKE FARTING INSIDE
A MANURE FACTORY.
BUT IT'S A LESSON FOR ACTIVISTSTHAT EVEN IN A RELATIVELY ZERO
SUM FIGHT, IF YOU CAN TAP INTOOUR RESERVES, YOU CAN TAKE A
FIGHT THAT SHOULD HAVELASTED JUST ONE DAY AND
MIRACULOUSLY MAKE IT LAST EIGHT-- TEEN HUNDRED!
>> IT'S BEEN OVER 2300 DAYSSINCE TRANS-CANADA FILED ITS
PERMIT APPLICATION.
>> ALMOST AS MUCH TIME AS ITTOOK US TO BUILD THE
TRANS-CONTINENTAL RAILROAD.
>> LONGER THAN IT TOOK LEWIS ANDCLARK TO EXPLORE THE LOUISIANA
PURCHASE.
>> LONGER THAN IT TOOK FOR THEUNITED STATES TO WIN WORLD
WAR II!
>> LONGER THAN THE AMOUNT OFTIME DURING HIS PRESIDENCY THAT
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT WAS STUCK INA BATHTUB!
(LAUGHTER)THEY COULDN'T GET HIM OUT SO,
AFTER A WHILE, THEY JUST DREWLEG HOLES IN IT AND LET HIM WALK
AROUND LIKE THAT!
THIS IS WHAT VICTORY SOMETIMESLOOKS LIKE IN A DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM. MAYBE YOU CAN'T STOPOUR COUNTRY FROM QUENCHING
OUR CEASELESS THIRST FOR THEDIRTIEST OF DIRTY OILS,
THE ANAL OF OILS,
BUT AT LEAST NOW MAYBE WE'LL BEENCOURAGED TO BRING THAT OIL IN
SOME SAFER WAY.
>> WHETHER OR NOT THE NORTHERNLEG OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE
GETS APPROVAL FROM WASHINGTON,THE INDUSTRY SAYS THAT OIL WILL
GET WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO.
>> OIL COMPANIES HAVE TURNED TOTRAINS, BARGES AND TRUCKS TO
GET THEIR GOODS TO MARKET,OFTEN WITH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES.
>> MOST EXPERTS SAY TRANSPORTINGOIL BY PIPELINE IS FAR SAFER
THAN BY RAIL OR BY BARGE.
>> Jon: TRAINS!
AND BARGES!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
DAMN YOU!
