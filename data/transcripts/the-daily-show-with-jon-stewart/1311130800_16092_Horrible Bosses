(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BIG SHOW.
BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG SHOW.
OUR GUESTS TONIGHT, WE HAVE ON
TONIGHT'S PROGRAM PAKISTAN'S
FORMER PRESIDENT PERVEZ
MUSHARRAF.
MY GUESS IS WE'LL HAVE A
DELIGHTFUL BEVERAGE AND A LOVELY
CONVERSATION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
ON GOING "NEWS OF THE WORLD"
PHONE HACKING SCANDAL.
TO GET YOU CAUGHT UP, A
SEEMINGLY SIMPLE STORY.
MA AND PA OWNED NEWSPAPER
HACKING INTO A MURDERED LITTLE
GIRL'S PHONE AND...
(LAUGHTER).
... PAYING THE POLICE TO COVER
IT UP.
HAS UNFORTUNATELY TURNED UGLY.
(LAUGHTER)
AS OF NOW, LONDON'S TWO TOP
POLICEMEN AT SCOTLAND YARD LET'S
CALL THEM OFFICER BLU ROTTON HAS
RESIGNED.
ANDREW COLTON HAS BEEN ARRESTED
AND SUNDAY TRAGICALLY
AUTHORITIES ARRESTED POOR
MRS. WEASLEY.
(LAUGHTER)
WAIT, NO THAT'S NOT
MRS. WEASLEY.
SORRY, TRAGICALLY, AUTHORITIES
ARRESTED THE GUY FROM SIMPLY
RED.
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
ACTUALLY, ARRESTED WAS REBEKAH
BROOKS, THE WOMAN WHO RAN "NEWS
OF THE WORLD" DURING THE WORST
OF-- AS THE BRITISH CALL THEM--
THE TROUBLES.
(LAUGHTER)
BROOKS HAD ALREADY RESIGNED HER
POST FRIDAY, OSTENSIBLY TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HER RABBIT HAIR
DRESSER.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WAS A DEEP CUT.
I APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS A
DEEP CUT.
HONESTLY, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE
THIS STORY...
(LAUGHTER).
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS STORY
GETTING MORE OUT OF CONTROL.
>> BREAKING NEWS.
>> ON THE BRITISH HACKING
SCANDAL, JUST A SHORT TIME AGO,
POLICE SAY SEAN HOARE-- THAT'S
THE REPORTER WHO FIRST ALLEGED
WIDESPREAD HACKING AT THE NOW
ENDED NEWS OF NATION-- HE'S BEEN
FOUND DEAD IN HIS HOME.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK HE DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES OR WAS IT
MURDOCH?
(OMINOUS MUSIC).
(APPLAUSE)
WELL, I'M SURE SCOTLAND YARD'S
ON THIS CASE LIKE CREAM ON A...
>> RIGHT NOW POLICE SAY THE
DEATH IS NOT CONSIDERED
SUSPICIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WELL, I GUESS THE GUYS
WHO WERE BRIBED DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS IN
THE DEATH OF THE GUY WHO BLEW
THE WHISTLE ON THE COMPANY
PROVIDING THE BRIBES, I'M
SATISFIED.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, THE WHOLE BUSINESS
WAS PRELUDE TO TODAY'S MAIN
EVENT.
RUPERT MURDOCH AND HIS SON JAMES
APPEARING BEFORE PARLIAMENT'S
COMMITTEE ON CULTURE, MEDIA,
SPORT, AND VOWEL-SHAPED
FURNITURE.
(LAUGHTER)
CONFESS BEFORE THE U-SHAPED DESK
OF CONTRITION!
DON'T MAKE US BRING IN THE E!
(LAUGHTER)
THE WHOLE DAY OF TESTIMONY WAS
AMAZING BUT PERHAPS NO MOMENT
MORE REMARKABLE THAN MURDOCH
INTERRUPTING HIS SON'S OPENING
STATEMENT.
>> OF THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD"
NEWSPAPER...
>> BEFORE YOU GET TO THAT, I
WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY ONE
SENTENCE.
THIS IS THE MOST HUMBLE DAY OF
MY LIFE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: NOT SO HUMBLE YOU
COULDN'T WAIT FOR YOUR TURN TO
TALK!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY, THAT WAS BEFORE SOME
IDIOT TRIED TO PIE MURDOCH.
THE YOUNG WOMAN IN PINK, WHOSE
LIGHTNING REFLEX AND
DEVASTATING... HER LIGHTNING
REFLEX AND DEVASTATING CHUCK
NORRIS-ESQUE HAND SPEED SUBDUED
THE MISCREANT.
THAT WOMAN IS, IN FACT, RUPERT
MURDOCH'S WIFE WENDY.
NOW, I AM NOT A BIG PROPONENT OF
THE FOUR DECADE MARRIAGE AGE
GAP.
BUT...
(LAUGHTER).
... IF EVER THERE WAS A
SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD PAY
DIVIDENDS...
(LAUGHTER).
... IT WOULD BE AN AMBUSH LIKE
THAT.
OF COURSE, THE ATTACK OCCURRED
AFTER A PERIOD OF THE TESTIMONY
WHERE MURDOCH MAY HAVE APPEARED
SOMEWHAT VULNERABLE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT OF IT?
CRIKEY, IS IT OVER?
