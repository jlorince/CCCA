GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THEPRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER OF
FARM SANCTUARY, HIS NEW BOOKIS CALLED "LIVING THE FARM
SANCTUARY LIFE, THE ULTIMATEGUIDE TO EATING MINDFULLY,
LIVING LONGER AND FEELING BETTEREVERY DAY," PLEASE WELCOME
TO THE PROGRAM, MR. GENE BAUER,SIR.
(APPLAUSE)THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> Jon: I'M DELIGHTED TO SEEYOU HERE.
YOU GUYS DO INCREDIBLE WORK.
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THEWHOLE THING ON LIVING THE
FARM SANCTUARY LIFE, THE BOOK,EXPLAIN TO ME VERY BRIEFLY,
WHAT IS FARM SANCTUARY?
>> FARM SANCTUARY IS ANORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO
PROTECT FARM ANIMALS FROM THECRUELTY OF FACTORY FARMING.
WE OPERATE SANCTUARIES WHERETHE ANIMALS GET TO LIVE OUT
THEIR LIVES.
AND THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT HAVELITERALLY BEEN THROWN IN
TRASH CANS OR ON PILES OF DEADANIMALS.
SO WE JUST TAKE CARE OF THEM,THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS, NOT OUR
FOOD.
AND WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE JUST TOTHINK ABOUT THE WAY WE LIVE AND
EAT AND TO MAKE MORE MINDFULCHOICES.
>> Jon: IT'S HARDER TO EATMEAT WHEN YOU KNOW THE
ANIMALS' NAME, I HAVE FOUND.
>> SO TRUE, SO TRUE, SO TRUE.YES.
>> Jon: BECAUSE I AM-- LOOK,ON THE ONE SIDE, THIS EATING
MINDFULLY AND VEGAN SEEMS TOBE THE SOLUTION TO NUTRITION,
TO HEALTH, TO GLOBAL WARMING.
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: ON THE OTHER SIDE,CORN BEEF.
>> WELL, THERE'S HABITS. THERE'SHABITS.
>> Jon: HOW DO WE, HOW DO WEBRIDGE THAT GAP?
>> WELL, THERE ARE NOW MEATLESSMEATS THAT CAN TASTE A LOT
LIKE CORN BEEF.
AND --
>> Jon: HMM?
>> YEAH, THEY CAN, THEY CAN.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> AND THEY'RE GETTING BETTEREVERY YEAR.
AND IT'S GETTING EASIER ANDEASIER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.
AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY COMPANIESTHAT HAVE BEEN SET UP TO
CREATE PLANT-BASED MEATSTHAT HAVE A VERY SIMILAR
MOUTH FEEL, A SIMILARTEXTURE AND TASTE. AND --
>> Jon: CAN I GET --
>> BUT YOU CAN ALSO EAT BEANS.
YOU DON'T NEED TO EAT THAT STUFFEITHER.
YOU KNOW, WHOLE FOODS.
>> Jon: BECAUSE IF I WERE TO GETTHIS, WILL AN OLD JEWISH MAN
YELL AT ME WHILE I EAT ITTHOUGH?
THAT'S REALLY, THAT'S THECORN BEEF EXPERIENCE I WOULD
MISS.
>> THAT COULD HAPPEN, THATCOULD HAPPEN.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,IT'S INTERESTING.
SO THE DIETARY COUNCIL JUSTRELEASED, I MEAN ON THE
HEELS OF THIS BOOK, THATTHIS VEGAN LIFESTYLE IS SORT
OF THE SOLUTION TO SO MANYOF THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING
ON IN THE WORLD.
>> YEAH. WE COULD SAVE 70% ONHEALTH-CARE COSTS IF WE
SHIFTED TO A WHOLE FOODSPLANT-BASED DIET IN THIS
COUNTRY.
WE COULD SAVE SO MUCH INTERMS OF RESOURCES, WATER,
FOR EXAMPLE.
HALF OF THE WATER USED INTHIS COUNTRY IS USED TO
RAISE ANIMALS FOR FOOD.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO SHIFTING AWAY FROM EATINGANIMALS AND EATING PLANTS
WOULD PUT A MUCH LIGHTERFOOTPRINT ON THE PLANET.
GLOBAL WARMING IS A WHOLE OTHERTHING, CLIMATE CHANGE.
ANIMAL AGRICULTURECONTRIBUTES MORE TO CLIMATE
CHANGE THAT THE ENTIRETRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY.
SO YOU KNOW, JUST BYSHIFTING TO EATING PLANTS,
WE CAN HAVE ENORMOUS IMPACTS.
YOU KNOW, ON ANIMALS, ON THEPLANET AND ON OUR OWN
WELL-BEING, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT I LOVEABOUT THIS BOOK THOUGH.
IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, I THINKSOMETIMES THOSE WHO HAVE
ADOPTED THIS LIFESTYLE CANSOMETIMES GET A LITTLE
SANCTIMONIOUS OR SOMETIMES LIKE --
>> WE'RE A PASSIONATE GROUP, FORSURE.
>> Jon: VERY PASSIONATE BUT CANREALLY GIVE YOU THE ONCE
OVER IF THEY CATCH YOUTHROWING DOWN A LIT BIT OF,
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU CALL,BACOS.
I GUESS YOU CALL THEM BACOS.
>> THERE ARE ACTUALLY, BACOSARE VEGAN, BELIEVE IT OR
NOT.
>> Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
>> YEAH. YEAH.
>> Jon: OH, THIS WOULD BE EASYFOR ME THEN.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGSTHAT ARE VEGAN BUT YOU
WOULDN'T KNOW IT.
THAT IS THE OTHER REALLYCOOL THING THAT'S HAPPENING.
>> Jon: GENE, I EAT ABACO'S-BASED DIET. ALWAYS HAVE.
>> YEAH. NOW YOU COULD DO THIS.
>> Jon: HAVE IT ON ALMOSTEVERYTHING.
BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS YOUTAKE INTO ACCOUNT, IT'S
PRAGMATIC.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNTTHAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY
TRANSITION FOR PEOPLE.
THAT WE HAVE BEEN RAISED ONA CERTAIN THING AND THERE'S
A LOT OF THINGS IN HERE THATTALK ABOUT TRYING TO JUST
MAKE SMALL LIFESTYLE CHANGESTHAT CAN STILL MAKE A BIG
DIFFERENCE.
>> VERY TRUE. AND FOR EXAMPLE,SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS,
YOU CAN JUST DO VEGGIEMEATBALLS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OR PUT VEGGIES IN THERE. SOTHAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU
COULD DO. INSTEAD OF HAMBURGERS--
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> VEGGIE BURGERS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OR YOU COULD ALSO JUSTEAT BEANS AND WHOLE FOODS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, AND VEGGIES ANDFRUITS AND --
>> Jon: OR EVEN LIKE YOU SAYJUST DO IT ONCE A WEEK.
>> ONCE A WEEK, MEATLESSMONDAYS IS A GREAT PROGRAM.
>> Jon: RIGHT. TOFU TUESDAY, FORGOD'S SAKE.
>> TOFU TUESDAY.
>> Jon: WE COULD DO THIS ALLDAY.
>> WE COULD.
>> Jon: WHAT IS, IS THEDIFFICULTY OF THIS, BECAUSE YOU
HAVE THE MORAL ARGUMENT THATSORT OF THIS IDEA THAT THESE
ANIMALS, WE DON'T UNDERSTANDTHEY'RE INDIVIDUALS.
>> THEY ARE.
AND THEY HAVE EMOTIONALLIVES.
THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS.
AND THEY WANT TO LIVE JUSTLIKE WE DO. THEY'RE NOT LIKE --
THEY'RE NOT DIFFERENT FROM CATSAND DOGS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IN TERMS OF THEIR DESIRE TOBE FRIENDS WITH US.
AND AT FARM SANCTUARY AND ITHINK THAT YOU HAVE STARTED
TO EXPERIENCE THIS TOO -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> WITH ANIMALS, THEY GETTO KNOW YOU AND START
FOLLOWING YOU AROUND. ANDWE HAVE TURKEYS ON THE FARM
WHO JUST LOVE HUMANCOMPANIONSHIP.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THAT IS SOMETHING MOSTPEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND OR
RECOGNIZE.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN THESEANIMALS ARE BEING MISTREATED
ON FACTORY FARMS AND WHENWE'RE EATING THEM --
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> THERE IS SORT OF AN EMOTIONALDESIRE NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
>> Jon: BUT, SO YOU HAVE ALL OFTHESE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT.
DO YOU FEEL THE TIDECHANGING?
>> OH YEAH.
>> Jon: IT SEEMS LOOK IT'SCHANGING.
>> IN A HUGE WAY.
THERE IS MORE AWARENESS NOWTHAN THERE'S EVER BEFORE.
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THEWAY WE HAVE BEEN EATING IN THIS
COUNTRY IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC.
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROMHEART DISEASE, CANCER.
PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THATCLIMATE CHANGE IS A MAJOR
ISSUE WE NEED TO LOOK AT.
AND WE CAN MAKE ONE CHOICETO EAT PLANT FOODS INSTEAD
OF ANIMAL FOODS AND IT WILLHAVE AN IMPACT.
AND SO, AND IT IS SOMETHINGEVERYBODY CAN DO.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS INTHIS WORLD THAT WE DON'T HAVE A
LOT OF CONTROL OVER.
BUT WHAT WE DECIDE TO EAT,EACH OF US EVERY DAY HAS A
CHOICE TO MAKE.
>> Jon: AND THAT'SINTERESTING AND MAYBE THE ONE
THING THAT'S DIFFICULT FORPEOPLE IS THAT IT WOULD SEEM
OVERWHELMING.
LIKE DO YOU HAVE TO COOK? YOUKNOW, THE ONE THING THAT WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DO IN THIS SOCIETYIS MAKE THINGS CONVENIENT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU CAN DRIVE UP AND GETJUST POISON IN A BOX.
AND, BUT IT'S --
>> IT IS WHAT WE HAVE GOT.POISON IN A BOX. YEAH.
>> IT'S FAST AND IT, YOU KNOW,WILL THIS LIFESTYLE BE ABLE TO
COMPETE OR WILL IT EVER BE ABLETO COMPETE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE
THAT SAME KIND OFCONVENIENCE OR IS THAT THE
NEXT WAVE, IS THAT THE NEXTTHING THAT IS COMING?
>> I THINK THE CONVENIENCEIS COMING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU HAVE VEGAN FAST-FOODRESTAURANTS NOW THAT ARE BEING
ESTABLISHED AROUND THE COUNTRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU HAVE VEGAN MEATLESS MEAT,VEGAN DAIRY PRODUCTS.
>> Jon: THEY'VE GOT TO COME UPWITH A BETTER THING THAN
MEATLESS MEATS BECAUSE THATJUST, JUST IN TERMS OF
SLOGANEERING, WE'VE GOT --
>> NOT SO GREAT.
>> Jon: I'LL HAVE A DELICIOUSMEATLESS MEAT.
THAT'S THE NEXT, I THINK --
>> AND NON-DAIRY MILKS TOO,LIKE YOU GO TO
MAINSTREAM GROCERY STORESTHERE IS ALTERNATIVES TO
COW'S MILK EVERYWHERE. SO IT'SGETTING A LOT EASIER.
>> Jon: YEAH, I'M A LACTAIDMAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY CAN DO WITH THAT. BUTTHAT'S --
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: HAVE I SHARED TOO MUCHALREADY WITH THE AUDIENCE?
>> IT IS REALLY A TERRIFICBOOK. IT JUST IT LAYS IT OUT
SO SIMPLY ANDINCREDIBLY AND TONS OF
GREAT RECIPES. I REALLYAPPRECIATE IT.
YOU GUYS ARE DOINGPHENOMENAL WORK AT FARM
SANCTUARY AND THIS BOOK ISGREAT AS WELL.
SO GET IT!
