NOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING HOW A HIGH PROFILE CONSERVATIVE LIKE SARAH PALIN COULD INFILTRATE
AMERICA'S FAVORITE MORNING SHOW IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.
WE WONDER IT HAD SAME THING SO WE SENT JOHN OLIVER OVER THERE THIS MORNING TO INVESTIGATE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WHEN SARAH PALIN ANNOUNCED HER AUDACIOUS INFILTRATION OF
THE "TODAY" SHOW SHE WAS UNDERTAKING A PERILOUS VOYAGE,
FROM THE CONSERVATIVE FOX HOLE TO NBC'S LIBERAL HORNET'S NEST.
IF SHE SUCCEEDS IN THIS DANGEROUS CROSSING, SHE WILL END UP IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST,
THE HEART OF THE LIBERAL MEDIA.
(CAR BLEEPING) I'M (BLEEP)ING REPORTING HERE!
WITH HER WAR PAINT APPLIED, I TRIED TO WARN HER OF WHAT SHE HAD IN STORE WHILE ALSO TRYING
TO BLEND IN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST HOST,
SARAH PALIN.
>> EVERYONE STANDING IN THE COLD WIND WITNESSING HER FIRST STEPS INTO ENEMY TERRITORY WAS
INSPIRED BY HER COURAGE.
WAS THAT THE BRAVEST THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN?
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT, NO.
I.
>> WAS IT THE SECOND-BRAVEST THING?
>> IT WAS BRAVE, I WOULD SAY.
>> HER STEEL IS SCORCHED, HER STEEL IS TEMPERED, HER STEEL IS POLISHED, IT'S PERFECTED.
>> OKAY, I GET THE STEEL ANALOGY.
SHE'S A PIECE OF STEEL.
>> SARAH PALIN SAID SHE'S INFILTRATING THE SHOW TODAY.
>> YEAH.
>> DO YOU THINK SHE'S MISTAKING THE WORD "INFILTRATING FOR"
"BEING INVITED ON"?
>> YEAH, MAYBE.
>> BUT THE THRONGS OF TOURISTS WERE ALSO CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY.
>> I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.
I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY DID, LIKE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAW THE KATIE COURIC INTERVIEW BACK IN THE 2008 ELECTION.
>> THAT WAS WHEN THEY MADE HER LOOK LIKE A (BLEEP)ING IDIOT.
LAUGH.
>> I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS NOT EVEN AN INTERVIEW, IT WAS AN AMBUSH.
>> IT WAS AN AMBUSH OF WORDS AND QUESTIONS.
>> SURE.
>> SADLY, WHILE SARAH SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED, HER SUPPORTERS WERE KEPT OUT BY
NBC'S LIBERAL THUGS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SHARE THEIR BEAUTIFUL VISION WITH THE WORLD.
THIS IS THE BANNER THAT NBC WOULD NOT ALLOW ON TELEVISION.
THE POWERFUL IMAGE OF SARAH PALIN BEING KARATE CHOPPED BY RONALD REAGAN'S GHOST.
>> I WOULD SAY WHEN I CREATED THIS SHE WAS BEING SALUTED BY HIM.
>> SALUTED BY HIS GHOST, NOT KARATE CHOPPED?
THAT'S MUCH MORE SENSIBLE.
INFILTRATING THE TARGET IS ONE THING.
SHE NOW HAD TO EMBARK ON THE LONG JOURNEY BACK TO THE SAFETY OF HER BASE CAMP.
AFTERWARDS THE CONCERN IS HOW SARAH PALIN WILL GET FROM 30 ROCK BACK TO THE FOX NEWS BUILDING.
IT'S A PERILOUS JOURNEY THAT MAY TAKE HER AS MUCH... ACTUALLY,
WE'RE ALREADY... THAT'S IT, IT'S RIGHT THERE.
HOLY (BLEEP) THAT'S (BLEEP)ING CLOSE.
PALIN STRUCK A BLOW AGAINST THE ALL-POWERFUL LIBERAL MEDIA.
BUT THE WAR WAS FAR FROM WON.
DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER SEE THE DAY WHERE THERE WILL BE A CONSERVATIVE MEDIA?
>> NO.
>> REALLY.
EVEN A DOMINEERING MEDIA ORGANIZATION LITERALLY A BLOCK AND A HALF FROM HERE?
>> NEVER.
>> IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, WILL IT?
>> NEVER.
>> IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
>> BUT SARAH PALIN WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT-- ONE AWKWARD TORI SPELLING COOKING
SEGMENT AT A TIME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
