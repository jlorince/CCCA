>> THIS IS CNN.
.>> A LITTLE BIT OF A BUZZ HERE,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
A COUPLE OFFICERS RUSHING DOWNTHE STREETS TOWARD THOSE
FLASHING LIGHTS.
YOU SEE SOME TACTICAL VEHICLESMOVING AROUND HERE.
WE SAW AT LEAST FOUR SWAT TEAMMEMBERS WITH HELMETS ON WHAT
APPEARED TO BE NIGHT VISIONGOGGLES, WE SEE SOME SQUAD CARS
AROUND HERE.
THIS APPARENTLY IS SOME KIND OFA RESCUE CHOPPER AND WE'VE SEEN
KIND OF A RESCUE BASKET ORSOMETHING.
THAT'S ABOUT AS LOW AS WE'VESEEN HIM GO.
SO THAT IS KIND OF ANINTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.
>> Jon:  NO, NO THAT'S NOT ANINTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.
THOSE ARE NOT INTERESTINGDEVELOPMENTS.
YOU'RE JUST STANDINGIN FRONT OF A
CAMERA NAMING [BLEEP] YOU SEE.
IT'S NOT ANYTHING.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> IT'S LIKE WALKING DOWN THE
STREET WITH A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.
[LAUGHTER]POLICE CAR.
FIRE HYDRANT.
FOR SOME REASON CNN THOUGHT TOINCLUDE THEIR SEARCH FOR EVEN
THE MOST BANAL OF BACKGROUNDNFACTS.
>> PAUL, ARE YOU ON THE LINE.
LET'S GO TO BARBARA STARRBECAUSE SHE KNOWS ABOUT THIS
BUILDING.
HOW LARGE IS THIS BUILDING,BARBARA?
BARBARA'S ON THE PHONE WITH HERSOURCES GATHERING MORE
INFORMATION.

>> TODD, TELL US HOW LARGE THISBUILDING IS, DO YOU KNOW.
>> Jon:  CAN SOMEONE TELL HERHOW [BLEEP] THE BUILDING IS.
CAN SOMEONE JUST TELL HER HOW[BLEEP] THE BUILDING IS, SOMEONE
PLEASE.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO MOVEFORWARD UNTIL SHE FINDS OUT HOW
LARGE THIS BUILDING IS.
WE'RE IN SQUARE FOOTAGE WORMHOLE TERRITORY HERE.
AND THEN INEVITABLY  --BLITZER.
>> THE FACT, TOM, THAT THISINDIVIDUAL IS
DESCRIBED AS SOMEONE DRESSED INA BLACK TOP,
BLACK JEANS WHAT DOES THAT SAYIF ANYTHING ABOUT A POSSIBLE
MOTIVE OR WHATEVER.
CAN WE BEGIN TO DRAW ANY INITIALCONCLUSION?
[LAUGHTER]>> WHAT DOES THE BLACK TOP AND
BLACK JEANS SAY ABOUT POSSIBLEMOTIVE.
I DON'T KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU ASKYOUR BEST COLLEAGUE.
[CROWD CHEERING]>> PERHAPS THE WORST PART OF THE
BLITZER REPORTAGE BESIDESUSING PHRASES LIKE.
CAN WE BEGIN TO DRAW INITIALCONCLUSIONS.
THAT'S A SEMANTIC WORKAROUNDFOR SAYING MAKE [BLEEP] UP.
I'M ON UNTIL 4:00.
CNN'S BRASH ON AIRACKNOWLEDGMENT THEY SHOULD NOT
BE DOING THIS AT ALL.
>> WHAT DOES THAT SAY IFANYTHING ABOUT A POSSIBLE MOTIVE
OR WHATEVER.
CAN WE BEGIN TO DRAW ANY INITIALCONCLUSIONS.
I WANT TO ALERT OUR VIEWERSSOMETIMES THESE INITIAL
CONCLUSIONS CAN OBVIOUSLY BEVERY VERY WRONG.
>> Jon:  YES, YES, CORRECT.
THEY CAN BE VERY VERY WRONG.
SO DON'T SAY THEM OUT LOUD.
IF IT'S AN URGENT SIDE OF YOUTHAT YOU HAVE TO GET OUT, HAVE A
SPECULATION JAR.
[LAUGHTER][BLEEP] OH MY GOD WE'RE ALL
GOING TO DIE.
[CROWD CHEERING]>> Jon:  SOMEONE KEEPS WEED IN
THIS.
WHO KEEPS WEED IN THIS.
SOMEBODY KEEPS WEED IN THIS.
MOTHER [BLEEP] REALLY.
[APPLAUSE]>> Jon:  SPECULATION IS LIKE A
COMPULSION.
>> IF THERE ARE THREE SHOOTERS,WOLF,
IF THAT PROVES TO BE CORRECTIT'S GOING TO BE THE MOSTECT
SIGNIFICANT FACT.
S>> THAT'S A STARTLING PIECE OFINFORMATION,
IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BEACCURATE.
>> THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION HEBELIEVES TO BE ACCURATE HE'S
BEEN GIVEN BUT TURNS OUT TO BEINACCURATE.
>> IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS THEINFORMATION THAT IS FLOWING SO
QUICKLY IS OFTEN WRONG.
AND YOU NOW HAVE SOMEINFORMATION FOR US.
[LAUGHTER]>> I KNOW YOU THINK SAYING THIS
COULD ALL BE WRONG MAKES ITOK TO SAY IT. BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE IT OKAY.
NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD ISALLOWED TO OPERATE THAT WAY.
HELLO I'M YOUR DOCTOR YOU HAVECANCER.
OF COURSE.
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MY INITIALDIAGNOSIS ARE VERY VERY WRONG.
THAT BEING SAID, THAT BEING SAIDYOU HAVE CANCER.
UNLESS YOU DON'T.
THESE TEST RESULTS ARE JUSTCOMING IN HERE SO FAST AND
FURIOUS AND I CAN'T WAIT.
I'LL KNOW FOR SURE IN AN HOUR IFYOU HAVE CANCER OR NOT BUT
[BLEEP] YOU HAVE CANCER, I JUSTGOT TO GET IT OUT.
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED,THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED ALL OF
YESTERDAY'S CONFUSION IN THEREPORTING IT'S NOT A MISTAKE
BECAUSE SADLY THE ONE THING INTHIS COUNTRY, THEY SHOULD HAVE
GREAT PRACTICE IN COVERING ARETHESE HORRIFIC SHOOTING
TRAGEDIES.
AND THERE ARE A TON OF REALLYSMART PEOPLE AND GOOD
JOURNALISTS WHO WORK OVER ATCNN.
THIS IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS AFTERTTHE CRITICISM OF CNN'S CHAOTIC
BOSTON TERRORISM COVERAGE
INCLUDING WHEN THEYANNOUNCED ON AIR AN ARRESTTHAT HAD NOT HAPPENED.
SO MY FINAL NOT INITIALCONCLUSION IS, THIS IS
DELIBERATE.
THE CHAOS, THE VOMIT ON TO THESCREEN, THE VERY THING WE
THOUGHT NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WERECREATED TO CLARIFY IS THE
FEATURE, NOT A BUG.
HERE'S CNN'S BOSS DESCRIBING THELESSON THEY LEARNED FROM THE
BOSTON COVERAGE.
>> WE MADE THAT MISTAKE FROMTHE BOSTON COVERAGE TWO DAYS
LATER AS THE DRAMA UNFOLDEDIN BOSTON WE HAD OUR BIGGEST
AUDIENCE IN TEN YEARS.
DO YOU KNOW WHO GOT IT,UNDERSTOOD WE MADE A MISTAKE AND
ACKNOWLEDGED IT?
THE AUDIENCE.
>> OH MY GOD.
THE LESSON THEY TAKE IS ITDOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH THEY
BETRAY OUR TRUST.
WE'LL KEEP COMING BACK.
WE'RE IN AN ABUSIVERELATIONSHIP WITH CNN.
IT'S TIME WE KICKED THOSEBASTARDS TO THE CURB BECAUSE WE
HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS NETWORKWAS CREATED BY TED TURNER, NOT
IKE TURNER.
