CHEERLEADER, AS WELL?
OF COURSE, AT OUR SHOW THE MAIN
ATTRACTION OF PRIMARY NIGHT WAS
GETTING TO SEE THE NEWS NETWORKS
STRUT THEIR THANG.
HOW DID THINGS GO AT MSNBC?
>> REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING A
THREE-WAY IN MISSISSIPPI.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OH, BOY.
>> I, OF COURSE, AM CALLING IT A
THREE-WAY.
BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST
HEARD, WHERE...
>> WELL...
>> DO YOU WANT THE TAKE A
BREATH?
>> THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CALLING
IT A THREE WAY IS BREATH TAKING
ENOUGH.
>> NOTHING IS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE
THAN RICK SANTORUM IS BEING IN A
THREESOME TO BE SURE.
>> WITH TWO VERY HANDSOME MEN.
>> IT WAS LIKE HAVING BRUNCH
WITH FRIENDS YOU WENT TO OBERLIN
WITH TEN YEARS AGO AND HALF-WAY
THROUGH BREAKFAST YOU SUDDENLY
WONDER, WHY THE HELL AM I STILL
FRIENDS WITH THESE PEOPLE.
AND WHAT OF FOX?
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THEIR
TEAM.
WHILE I IMAGINE IT'S DIFFICULT
FOR THEM WATCHING THEIR OWN
PARTY TEAR ITSELF TO PIECE, THEY
DID THEIR BEST TO COVER IT.
>> WE WANT TO GET RIGHT TO THE
TOP STORY, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
SINKING POLL NUMBERS.
>> Jon: OR THEY COULD GO THAT
WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
YES, LAST NIGHT WHILE THE OTHER
NETWORKS DEVOTED MOST OF THEIR
COVERAGE TO THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARIES, FOX DECIDED TO
PREEMPT IT WITH STANDARD TUESDAY
NIGHT FARE.
>> WHY ARE LIBERALS OUTRAGED AT
THE IDEA PEOPLE THINK IT'S
MUSLIM?
IS IT BAD TO BE A MUSLIM?
>> JANE FONDA AND BARBARA
STREISAND ALL BY THEMSELVES
COULD BUY BIRTH CONTROL FOR
EVERY POOR WOMAN IN AMERICA.
>> ALL THIS WAS, WAS AN ATTEMPT
TO SMEAR GOVERNOR PALIN,
CONSERVATIVES.
>> THIS IS HOW THE LEFT IS
SPENDING THEIR TIME TRYING TO
MANIPULATE US, AND WE'RE OVER
IT.
GCB -- GOOD CHRISTIAN "BITCHES."
>> IF THEY HAD REPLACED THAT
CHRISTIAN WITH MUSLIM, FIRST OF
ALL, IT WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN
TO BE A PILOT, NO ONE WOULD HAVE
ACTED IN IT.
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SUED.
>> THIS IS CATERING TO THE DUMB
DESIRES OF VEHICULAR VOLVO-DRIVING DUMB
LEFTIES.
>> I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT
YOU.
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT FOX
WAS GOING FOR WITH ALL THOSE
CLIPS, SO LET ME SEE IF I CAN
CAN TRANSLATE THEM FOR
EVERYBODY.
