RIGHT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR FUN WITH
MR. SANTORUM AND HIS SOMEWHAT
ANTIQUATED VIEWS ON THE ROLES OF
WOMEN BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT
SOME CLEANED-OUT COBWEBS AND
DUST OFF OF SOMEONE'S VIEWS ON
GENDER, MEET FOX'S LIZ TROTTA
AND HEAR WHY SHE THINKS IT'S A
BAD IDEA FOR WOMEN TO SERVE
AMONGST MEN IN OUR MILITARY.
I WANT TO WARN THE MEN IN OUR
AUDIENCE, IF THERE ARE WOMEN IN
THE ROOM WHERE YOU'RE WATCHING
THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO
PROTECT THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THE
DEFENSE SECRETARY LEON PANETTA
COMMENTED ON A NEW PENTAGON
REPORT ON SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE
MILITARY.
AND THE REPORT SAYS THAT THERE'S
BEEN... SINCE 2006 A 64%
INCREASE IN VIOLENT SEXUAL
ASSAULTS.
NOW, WHAT DID THEY EXPECT?
THESE PEOPLE ARE IN CLOSE
CONTACT.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THE ORIGINAL
BAILIFF FROM "NIGHT COURT" IS
RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SIMPLE MATH!
IT'S SIMPLE MATH!
IF YOU WANT TO MIX THE SEXES,
YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 64%
UPTICK IN VIOLENT SEXUAL ASSAULT
THAT WILL OCCUR.
YOU KNOW OLD SAYING, YOU CAN'T
MAKE A COED OMELET WITHOUT
RAPING A FEW EGGS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY DID THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE
OF PANCAKES EVER ABANDON THAT
SLOGAN, ANYWAY?
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, THE ONLY WAY THIS WOMAN
COULD MAKE HER STATEMENT WORSE
IS TO SOMEHOW SUGGEST THAT
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY IS
ACTUALLY A FEMINIST BOONDOGGLE.
SPOILER ALERT: SHE'S GONNA MAKE
IT WORSE.
>> IT'S STRICTLY BEEN A QUESTION
OF PRESSURE FROM THE FEMINISTS.
AND THE FEMINISTS HAVE ALSO
DIRECTED THEM, REALLY, TO SPEND
A LOT OF MONEY.
THEY HAVE SEXUAL COUNSELORS ALL
OVER THE PLACE.
VICTIMS' ADVOCATES.
SEXUAL RESPONSE COORDINATORS.
SO YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE
BUREAUCRACY UPON BUREAUCRACY
BEING BUILT UP WITH ALL KIND OF
LEVELS OF PEOPLE TO SUPPORT
WOMEN IN THE MILITARY WHO WERE
NOW BEING RAPED TOO MUCH.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
(BOOS)
>> Jon: ARE YOU NOT
HORROR-TAINED?
RAPED TOO MUCH.
(LAUGHTER)
THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT
WE'VE GOT TO SPEND TO HELP WOMEN
WHO ARE RAPED TOO MUCH.
(LAUGHTER)
THINK OF HOW MUCH CHEAPER IT
WOULD BE FOR ALL OF US IF THEY
WERE RAPED JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT.
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU WERE
WONDERING WHAT THIS PULLING ON
HER EAR WAS ALL ABOUT, SHE'S NOT
HAVING TROUBLE WITH HER EAR
PIECE, THAT IS HER BRAIN TRYING
TO ESCAPE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LOOK, LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LISTEN TO ME I'M JUST GOING
TO (BLEEP)ING LEAVE.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M GOING TO CRAWL OUT OF YOUR
SKULL AND LET YOU JUST
