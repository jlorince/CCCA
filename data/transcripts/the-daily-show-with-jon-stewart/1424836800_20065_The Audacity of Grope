THERE'S BEEN A RUMOR THATVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN MAY BE
GUNNING FOR THE DEMOCRATICNOMINATION IN 2016.
BUT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THEPROMOTION, I THINK WE NEED TO
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW HE'S DOING INHIS CURRENT POSITION.

LET'S CALL IT AN ODD MOVE DURINGA SWEARING IN CEREMONY.
>> YOU CAN SEE THEVICE PRESIDENT AWKWARDLY PLACING
HIS HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OFSTEPHANIE CARTER, SHE IS THE NEW
DEFENSE SECRETARY'S WIFE.

AN ESTIMATED 28 SECONDS.
(LAUGHTER)(SIGHS)
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YOU SEEM TENSE.
IS IT THE STRESS OF ME GROPINGYOU FOR 28 STRAIGHT SECONDS?
JESUS!
28 SECONDS!
THAT'S LIKE THREE DECADES INGROPED ON CAMERA YEARS.
AND IF THAT WASN'T INAPPROPRIATEENOUGH, BIDEN PROCEEDED TO ACT
OUT THE POTTERY SCENEFROM "GHOST".
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER! TRYING TO--
HE'S IN QUITE GOOD SHAPE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEONE BEING SOOVER THE TOP GRATUITOUSLY HANDSY
SINCE, I DON'T KNOW, TWO NIGHTSAGO, I GUESS.
THIS BRINGS US TO OUR NEWESTSEGMENT JOE BIDEN, YOU ONLY HAVE
ONE (BLEEP) JOB!

ONE FEMALE MEMBER OF YOURIMMEDIATELY FAMILY --

HERE'S WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUTTHIS, BIDEN IS ACTUALLY VERY
GOOD ON WOMEN'SISSUES IN GENERAL.
