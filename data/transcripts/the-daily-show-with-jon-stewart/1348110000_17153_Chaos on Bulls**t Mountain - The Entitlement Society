LOOK, OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN HAS MANY, I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY PEAKS AND VALLEY, NOOKS AND CRANNIES.
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT BULLSHIT LOOKS LIKE.
LOOK, WHY AM I TELLING YOU PEOPLE.
LET'S DRILL DOWN TO THE CORE OF THIS THING.
>> TONIGHT IT IS ROMNEY UNPLUGGED AS THE G.O.P.
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE DELIVERS HIS SHARPEST CRITIQUE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY THAT HE
ENABLES ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS BUREAU.
IN 2011, 49% OF AMERICANS LIVED IN A HOUSEHOLDS WHERE AT LEAST ONE PERSON RECEIVED A GOVERNMENT HANDOUT.
>> THIS IS THE CONSIDER OF BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN.
THE 49% ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY OBAMA ENABLES.
THAT IS THE CORE OF THE BULLSHIT NATION FICTION THAT SOMEHOW ONLY SINCE OBAMA, THE HALF OF AMERICANS WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY
AND WORK HARD AND ARE GOOD, HAVE HAD THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR SEIZED AND HANDED OVER TO THE HALF OF THIS NATION THAT IS LAZY
AND DEPENDENT AND THE OPPOSITE OF GOOD.
I'M SURE THERE'S A BETTER TERM FOR THAT.
IN THAT 49%, HANNITY IS INCLUDING THOSE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, OR AS I LIKE THE CALL THEM, HIS AUDIENCE.
DEMOGRAPHIC TV AUDIENCE SLAM.
BUT PERHAPS MR. HANNITY IS UNDERSTATING THE PROBLEM, FOR THERE ARE MANY MORE OF THOSE TO BE GOVERNMENT DOLE THAN EVEN HIS
49% ACCOUNTS FOR.
LIKE THOSE WELFARE QUEENS AT EXXONMOBIL, AT&T, GE, 250 CORPORATION THAT FROM 2008 TO 2010 GOT NEARLY A QUARTER
TRILLION IN FEDERAL TAX SUBSIDIES, ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, AT LEAST EXXONMOBIL AND AT&T GIVE US BACK CHEAP GAS AND
RELIABLE CELL PHONE SERVICE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OR HOW ABOUT THIS, HERE'S ONE, THE WALL STREET FIRMS WHO WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE DISCOUNT BORROWING WINDOW AT THE NERVE.
OR THE $5 BILLION IN DIRECT FEDERAL PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS MOOCHER FARMERS, OR THE INCREDIBLE TAX BREAKS THE
GOVERNMENT GIVES THE INVESTOR CLASS, WHOSE MONEY IS TAXED AT A CAPITAL GAINS RATE OF 15%.
AS OPPOSED TO ORDINARY HAVING A JOB INCOME, WHICH CAN BE TAXED UP TO 35%.
BOY, I WISH WE HAD A POSTER BOY FOR THAT ELEMENT OF THE MOOCH-OCRACY.
OH, RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
IN 2010...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IN 2010, GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAD AN ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF $21.6 MILLION YET PAID ONLY $3 MILLION IN FEDERAL INCOME TAX OR 13.9%.
WITHOUT THE PREFERENTIAL INVESTOR TAX CODE, ROMNEY WOUND HAVE PAID $ 7.56 MILLION, A GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY OF $4.5
MILLION, OR THE PUT THAT ABSOLUTELY FAIR TAX BREAK GIVEN TO A JOB CREATOR IN MOOCHER CLASS DEPENDENCY TERMS, ENOUGH
FOOD STAMPS TO FEED MR. ROM THROUGH THE YEAR 4870.
BY THE WAY, THAT'S NO BULLSHIT, THAT'S THE MATH.
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE DENIZENS...
[APPLAUSE]
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM... THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE DENIZENS OF BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN IS THEY ACT LIKE THEIR SHIT DON'T STINK.
IF THEY HAVE SUCCESS, THEY BUILT IT.
IF THEY FAILED, THE GOVERNMENT RUINED IT FOR THEM.
IF THEY GET A BREAK, THEY DESERVE IT.
IF YOU GET A BREAK, IT'S A HANDOUT AND AN ENTITLEMENT.
IT'S A BAFFLING, WILLFULLY BLIND, COGNITIVE DISSIDENTS BEST SUMMED UP BY THEIR HEAD COACH.
>> IN WHAT IS PERHAPS MY FAVORITE SOUND BITE OF ALL TIME...
>> I'VE BEEN ON FOOD STAMPS AND WELFARE.
ANYBODY HELP ME OUT?
NO.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
