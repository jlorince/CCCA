THESE FOLKS JUST WANT TEACHERSTO GIVE BACK.
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT$50,000 A YEAR IN SALARY, PLUS
MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS AREINCREDIBLY GENEROUS, BORDERING
ON AVARICE.
AND I IMAGINE THESE SAME PEOPLEWILL FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT
COUPLES EARNING MORE THAN$250,000 A YEAR BEING ASKED TO
ALLOW THE BUSH TAX CUTS TOEXPIRE SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE
TO PAY A SLIGHTLY HIGHER FEDERALINCOME TAX RATE.
>> DOES A $250,000 INCOME LEVELREALLY RICH IN AMERICA?
>> HOW CAN ANYBODY CLAIM IF YOUMAKE $250,000 YOU'RE A
MILLIONAIRE.
>> $250,000 IS NOT RICH TO AFAMILY OF FOUR SENDING KIDS TO
COLLEGE.
IT'S CLOSE TO POVERTY.
>> PEOPLE THINK TO THINK THEY'RESITTING IN CHAIRS LIGHTING
CIGARS WITH $100 BILLS.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKINGABOUT.
>> Jon: NO, THAT IS NOT, NOTWHEN IT COMES TO THE BUSH TAX
CUTS.
THEY'RE NOT BIG-SHOT TEACHERSWITH THEIR DESKS, AND SEEMINGLY
ENDLESS SUPPLY OF MULTICOLOREDCONSTRUCTION PAPERS.
OH, AND THEIR NUMBER 2 PENCILS.
I GUESS NUMBER 3 PENCILS AREN'TGOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR MAJESTY!
( LAUGHTER )AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO COMPARE
TEACHERS TO WALL STREET.
NO CONTEST.
>> TEACHERS JUST DON'T GET PAIDNEARLY AS MUCH AS PEOPLE ON WALL
STREET DO.
THAT'S NOT-->> NOR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, DO
TEACHERS WORK AS MUCH.
THEY HAVE THE SUMMER OFF.
>> Jon: THE HEDGE FUND MANAGERISN'T PAID BY THE STATE, ISN'T
PAID BY THE TAXPAYERS.
BUT THE TEACHERS ARE.
SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
REGARDLESS OF THE GREED-BASED,ALMOST SLIGHTLY SOCIOPATHIC JOB
BANKERS DID WRECKING OUR ECONOMYTHOSE PEOPLE WERE THERE EVERY
SINGLE DAY, 12 MONTHS A YEAR.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NOT THAT NINE-MONTH BULL( BLEEP ).
AND WE THE TAXPAYERS, HAVE ARIGHT TO CUT TEACHER SALARIES
AND BENEFITS.
THEY WORK FOR US!
BANKERS ARE NOT SUCKLING FROMTHE TAXPAYERS' TEAT.
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR THEBILLIONS OF GALLONS OF TAXPAYER
BAILOUT TEAT MILK.
( LAUGHTER )THEY SUCKED ON SO VORACIOUSLY.
HEY, I WONDER HOW THOSE SAMEPEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE THE
GOVERNMENT LIMIT TEACHER PAY ANDBENEFITS WOULD FEEL ABOUT THE
GOVERNMENT LIMITING C.E.O. PAYAT BAILED OUT WITH TAXPAYER
MONEY FIRMS?
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGEEVERYONE.
IF YOU CUT EVERYBODY'S SALARY,ESPECIALLY ON WALL STREET,
YOU'LL LOOK AT A HUGE TALENTEXODUS.
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE THE WHOLECONCEPT, ELIZABETH, OF THE
GOVERNMENT PUTTING A SALARY, YOUKNOW, MARKER ON ANYTHING.
>> IF THE SHAREHOLDERS-- MEANINGTHE TAXPAYERS-- WANT TO GET
THEIR MONEY'S WORTH THEY BETTERDAMN WELL PAY THE C.E.O. WHAT A
GOOD C.E.O. DEMANDS.
>> IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY OFATTRACTING TALENT IN
THE FUTURE AND THEY'RE GOING TONEED ALL THE TALENT THEY CAN
GET.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY!
WE HAVE GOT TO PAY THOSEBAILED-OUT-FIRM C.E.O.s TOP
DOLLAR.
OTHERWISE THOSE COMPANIES COULDWIND UP BEING RUN BY A COUPLE OF
JACKASSES WHO ( BLEEP ) THINGSUP SO ROYALLY IT TORPEDOES THE
ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
WOULD YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN?
I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )NOW, TO BE FAIR, LET'S BE FAIR.
WE ARE NOTHING IF NOT FAIR.
TO BE FAIR, WE COULD NOT HAVECUT THOSE WALL STREET C.E.O.s'
PAY, EVEN IF WE WANTED TO.
THEY HAD CONTRACTS.
>> THERE ARE BONUSES THAT WEREPROMISED TO PEOPLE WHEN THESE
GUYS CAME IN.
THESE ARE CONTRACTUALOBLIGATIONS.
>> THE CONTRACTS ARE LEGALCONTRACTS, AND IT WASN'T AS IF
THESE BONUSES WERE UNKNOWN ORSPRUNG AT THE LAST MINUTE.
>> LET'S FACE IT, ANYBODY THATGETS A BONUS, THAT MONEY IS
SPENT LONG BEFORE THAT CHECKCOMES IN THE MAIL, RIGHT?
THESE POOR PEOPLE PAYING OFFMORTGAGES, PAYING OFF DEBT.
THE ODDS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVETHESE BONUSES ARE SLIM TO NONE
RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY, YOU KNOW.
( LAUGHTER )OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS BUILT ON
FAITH.
OUR WORD IS OUR BOND.
( LAUGHTER )AND EVEN IF WE COULD GET THE
WALL STREET BONUS MONEY BACK,WHAT DO YOU WANT THE WALL STREET
WORKERS TO DO, UNTAKE THOSE TWOWEEKS ON A YACHT IN ST. BART?
( LAUGHTER )UN-RERENOVATE YOUR KITCHEN?
( LAUGHTER )BY THE WAY, WHAT ABOUT
RESCINDING CONTACTUALOBLIGATIONS TO TEACHERS, YES,
YOU, EXACT SAME PERSON WHO SAYSYOU CAN'T GET IT BACK FROM WALL
STREET.
>> YOU KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING.
THEY ALL KNEW THIS WAS GOING TOCOME TO A HEAD.
AND I THINK IT IS SHOWING A POOREXAMPLE TO OUR KIDS THAT THESE
PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE FIGHTING,FIGHTING FOR THINGS THAT THEY
QUITE FRANKLY DON'T DESERVE.
THEY TOO, "TOO NEED TO MAKECONCESSIONS.
>> Jon: SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
AND I SAY THIS-- WHEN WILLAMERICA'S TEACHERS FOLLOW THE
LEAD OF WALL STREET AND STARTMAKING SOME SACRIFICES
FOR THE CHILDREN.
