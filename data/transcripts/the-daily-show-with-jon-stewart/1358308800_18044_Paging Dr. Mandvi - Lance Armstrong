>> THANK YOU, JON.
>> Jon: FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT HOW REMARKABLE IS ARMSTRONG'S ACCOMPLISHMENT?
GREAT QUESTION, JON.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING HOW DID LANCE ARMSTRONG MAINTAIN A WEB OF LIES FOR OVER 13 YEARS,
JUST ONE MORE TRIBUTE TO THIS INCREDIBLE ENDURANCE ATHLETE WHEN THE AVERAGE MAN CAN ONLY
SUSTAIN A SINGLE LIE FOR BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN HOURS BEFORE GUILT AND LACK OF OXYGEN.
GOO ON MY SHIRT.
I WAS DOING AN ART PROJECT WITH CHILDREN.
OKAY IT'S STRIPPER GLITTER!
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING IT'S PREPARATION.
>> AND TRAINING.
THIS IS PRACTICING RUNNING FROM THE TRUTH AT THE PRESTIGIOUS DICK NIXON HUMAN DEEXCEPTION LAB
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
EVEN THEN RESEARCHERS RECOGNIZED HIS GREATNESS.
>> Jon: PHYSIOLOGY HAS TO PLAY SOME ROLE IN THIS.
NOT JUST THE TRAINING.
WE COULD TRAIN FOR YEARS AND NEVER APPROACH THAT TYPE OF ENDURANCE.
>> CERTAINLY HIS INHERENT UNETHICAL ABILITY GIVES HIM --

THIS IS MY MEDICAL DEGREE RIGHT HERE.
WE JUST KNOW THIS STUFF, OKAY?
>> Jon: SO, OKAY, SO THIS EXPLAINS WHY WHY HE IS CAPABLE OF TELLING BIGGER LIES FOR
LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.
>> TO SOME EXTENT.

>> Jon: WHO.
ARE YOU SAYING WHAT I THINK YOU ARE SAYING?
>> I THINK I'M SAYING WHAT YOU THINK I'M SAYING.
>> Jon: I THINK YOU THINK I KNOW THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
SAY IT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SAY IT.
I BELIEVE HE HAS BEEN USING LIE ENHANCING DRUGS.
YOU NAME IT, HE'S ON IT.
FIB-ADR E, DEDECEPT-A FRIEND.

MILLIGRAMSES OF DOUCH
