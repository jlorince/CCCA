DOCTRINE DON'T YOU GET.
I MEAN BUGGING YOUR PHONESIS PRETTY WEAK TEA FOR US.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CIGARSHRAPNEL CASTRO IS STILL
PULLING OUT OF HIS ASS.
BESIDES, IF IT MAKES YOUFEEL ANY BETTER THE
GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOINGANYTHING TO YOU THAT THEY
AIN'T DOING TO US.

THEY'RE SPYING ON OUR STUDIO,AND I'M LITERALLY SAYING
THAT INTO A CAMERA THAT ISGOING TO BROADCAST.
IT SEEMS KIND OF REDUNDANT,I DON'T EVEN KNOW-- OKAY, I
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THATONE.

IT GOES THROUGH.
BY THE WAY, GERMANY, YOUMIGHT WANT TO EASE UP ON

OUR HUBRIS NOW, YOU SURE LIKEDIT WHEN YOU HANDED OFF THE
VIETNAM WAR-- COULD YOU HOLDTHIS WAR FOR US A LITTLE
BIT.
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO INALGERIA, AND PAKISTAN, YOU

BIN LADEN WAS CRASHING ONYOUR COUCH.
AND YOU, GERMANY, YEAH, YOU-- (LAUGHTER)

A PARTNER.
