OVERSIGHTS.
FOR MORE ON THIS STORY WE GOT
TO WYATT CENAC COMING TO US
LIVE FROM TEXAS.
( APPLAUSE )
WYATT, I KNOW YOU GREW UP IN
TEXAS.
IT'S GOT TO BE HEARTFUL AND
HURTFUL AND HURT YOUR HEART TO
BE REMINDED OF THE CASUAL
RACIAL INSENSITIVITY THAT HAS
LONG MARRED THAT STATE.
>> ACTUALLY, JON, I'M NOT IN
TEXAS.
I'M IN YOUR STATE.
I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF
NIGGER LAKE NEW YORK.
WOOO!
(LAUGHING)
>> Jon: SO THAT WAS YOU?
>> I LOVE IT.
>> Jon: I KNOW.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NEW YORK.
WE HAVE THAT IN.
>> IT'S REAL.
UP HERE IN HAMILTON COUNTY.
THE STATE EVEN LISTED IT ON
ITS WEBSITE UNTIL RECENTLY.
YOU CAN SEE WHY.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LAKE.
UNLESS YOU'RE A NIGGER.
>> Jon: WOW.
WYATT, I GUESS IT TAKES A
WHILE FOR NAME CHANGES TO GO
THROUGH.
>> HOW LONG DO YOU NEED?
YOU CAN CALL IT ANYTHING.
CAT (BEEP) LAKE.
FART SWALLOW LAKE.
TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES LAKE.
OR HOW ABOUT (BEEP) OVER
THERE?
I MEAN, THE POINT IS EVERYBODY
IS RUSHING TO CONDEMN TEXAS.
SURE, THERE'S A LOT OF RACIST
(BEEP) THAT GOES ON IN TEXAS.
BUT GUESS WHAT.
THERE'S NIGGER HEAD RAPIDS
IDAHO.
NIGGER HEAD POINT FLORIDA.
NIGGER HEAD POND VERMONT.
NIGGER HEAD CREEK NORTH
CAROLINA, GOOD FISHING.
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER
100 PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN
CALLED NIGGER HEAD IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THERE WAS EVEN A NIGGER HEAD
POINT IN NEW YORK.
IT'S OVER IN WAYNE COUNTY ON
LAKE ONTARIO BUT OUT OF
RESPECT THEY CHANGED IT TO
NEGRO HEAD POINT.
>> Jon: WOW, THAT'S....
>> THEN THEY REALIZED THAT
STILL WASN'T VERY RESPECTFUL
SO NOW THEY JUST CALL IT
GRAVE'S POINT.
>> Jon: GRAVES?
WHO DOES THAT REFER TO?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY SOME NIGGER NAMED
GRAVES.
>> Jon: WYATT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.
WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT
AMERICA?
>> IT SAYS THERE AREN'T ENOUGH
BLACK PEOPLE MAKING....
>> Jon: PERHAPS WE CAN....
>> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
INSULTING BLACK PEOPLE.
THAT RAND McNALLY GUY WAS KIND
OF A RACIST.
WHY ON EARTH WOULD THERE BE
PLACES LIKE CHINK PEAK?
DAGO PEAK?
SQUAW'S HEAD MOUNTAIN?
JAP ROAD.
SPOOK WOODS AND MEXICAN GULCH?
>> Jon: THIS IS EMBARRASSING
FOR AMERICA.
>> JON I DISAGREE.
WHILE AMERICA MAY HAVE A
LEGACY OF INTOLERANCE IT'S
ALSO SHOWN IT HAS THE CAPACITY
TO LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES AND
TRANSFORM THOSE UGLY FEELINGS
INTO EXPRESSIONS OF OUR
HIGHEST IDEALS.
>> Jon: WOW.
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, WYATT.
IT'S SO EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP
IN THE SHAMEFUL PARTS AND
OVERLOOK THE BEAUTY OF THE
COUNTRY.
>> YEAH IT REMINDS ME OF THAT
SONG, "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL.
"THE LOST VERSES.
