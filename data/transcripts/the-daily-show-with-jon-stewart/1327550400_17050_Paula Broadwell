(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SHOW, MY GUEST TONIGHT, A
RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT HARVARD
UNIVERSITY AND A Ph.D.
CANDIDATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
LONDON.
HER BOOK IS CALLED "ALL IN: THE
EDUCATION OF GENERAL DAVID
PETRAEUS."
PLEASE WELLDOM THE PROGRAM PAULA
BROADWELL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE THE
TRIATHLON WE BOTH DID.
>> YOU DID GREAT.
REALLY PROUD OF YOU.
KEEP AFTER IT.
>> Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED
"ALL IN."
NOW SO THE LAST TIME I RECALL A
JOURNALIST OR AUTHOR WITH
EMBEDDED... EMBEDDED WITH THE
PERSON AT THIS LEVEL IT WAS
McKRYSTAL AND IT WAS "ROLLING
STONE" AND HE GOT FIRED.
HOW DID THEY LET YOU... HOW DID
PETRAEUS ALLOW THAT?
DID HE KNOW YOU WERE THERE?
WERE YOU, LIKE, HIDING?
DID HE ALLOW THIS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I WAS AN INSURGENT.
NO.
I HAD BEEN WORKING ON THIS
PROJECT AS MY DISSERTATION AND
WHEN HE WENT TO AFGHANISTAN IN
THE SUMMER OF 2010 I DECIDED TO
TURN IT INTO A BOOK AND I SHOT
HIM AN E-MAIL AND SAID "I'M
GOING TO GO FOR IT."
I'M NOT SURE HE TOOK ME
SERIOUSLY BUT I SHOWED UP IN
AFGHANISTAN, SENT HIM AN E-MAIL
AND SAID "I'M HERE I'M DOING
THIS."
AS YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND IS THE
MILITARY AND I WENT TO THE
MILITARY ACADEMY ALSO SO I HAD A
NATURAL NETWORK TO WORK WITH.
>> Jon: THEY TRUSTED YOU A
LITTLE BIT MORE.
AND LISTEN PEOPLE IN THESE BOOK
VERY RARELY... THEY ALWAYS THINK
"I'LL BE THE ONE TO OUTSMART,
I'LL GET THE ACCESS."
AND IT NEVER... BUT IN THIS... I
MEAN THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL
THING IS I WOULD SAY THE REAL
CONTROVERSY HERE IS IS HE
AWESOME OR INCREDIBLY AWESOME?
IT'S A NICE PORTRAIT.
>> I HAVE A DETAIL TO SHARE WITH
YOU.
HE CAN TURN WATER INTO BOTTLED
WATER.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> ISN'T THAT YOUR LINE?
>> Jon: WE DID FIND OUT HIS
NICKNAME IS PEACHES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT WAS PEACHES WHEN HE WAS
IN... HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND
IT FOLLOWED HIM TO WEST POINT
AND THAT STUCK A BIT.
>> Jon: WELL I THINK I STUCK
IT IN THERE RIGHT THERE.
PEACHES.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S TAKEN ON SOME OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT NATION BUILDING
EXERCISES THAT THIS COUNT ARE
HAS EVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH AND
YET HE SEEMS TO JUST KEEP AN
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND
FOCUS ON IT.
IS THAT YOUR SENSE?
>> HE'S A VERY HIGH ENERGY
PERSON AND I THINK HE DOES GAIN
ENERGY FROM FEELING LIKE HE'S
CONSEQUENTIAL AND MAKING A
DIFFERENCE AND HE LOVES SERVING
AND TO BE IN THE ARENA AND SO IN
SOME SENSE IT WAS AN HONOR FOR
HIM AND IN A GREAT SENSE IT WAS
AN HONOR TO GO BACK TO
AFGHANISTAN AND SERVE AS A FIELD
COMMANDER AGAIN.
>> Jon: DID YOU EVER THINK...
DO YOU PINCH HIM?
IT'S THE KIND OF A... DID YOU
JUST THINK "WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THIS CAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"
HE WAS SHOT AND, LIKE, THEY
PATCHED HIM UP AND SIX WEEKS
LATER HE WAS BACK OUT.
I MEAN...
>> HE'S HAD A COUPLE, YES.
HE WAS INJURED IN A FREE-FALL
PARACHUTE ACTION AND CRUSHED HIS
PELVIS AND IT WAS BACK IN THE
SWIMMING POOL SWIMMING A MILE A
COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER... COUPLE
WEEKS LATER AND THEN RUNNING
NINE MONTHS LATER.
HE WAS SHOT IN THE CHEST AND HE
WAS DOING PUSHUPS TO GET...
IMPROVE AND GET OUT OF THE
HOSPITAL AND STARTED RUNNING
AGAIN.
HE JUST HAS A TENACIOUS WILL AND
IS RELENTLESS IN WHATEVER HE
DOES AND I THINK GETTING BACK IN
THE...
>> Jon: YOU'RE A RUNNER AND TO
GET TO KNOW HIM, HE WANTED TO
RUN WITH YOU?
SO YOU RAN TOGETHER.
>> THIS IS A TYPICAL MECHANISM
HE USES TO GET TO KNOW YOUNG
PEOPLE.
HE'S DONE IT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE
SO IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME
TO INTERVIEW HIM ON A RUN AND I
THINK IT WAS... I WAS... I
THOUGHT I'D TEST HIM BUT HE WAS
GOING TO TEST ME AND IT ENDED UP
BEING A TEST FOR BOTH OF US
SINCE WE BOTH RAN QUICKLY.
BUT THAT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF
OUR RELATIONSHIP.
AND WHEN I WAS IN KABUL WE WOULD
DO A LOT OF INTERVIEWS ON RUNS.
FOR HIM I THINK IT WAS A GOOD
DISTRACTION FROM THE WAR AND, OF
COURSE, HE'S A BIT CONCERNED
THAT SOMEONE IN HIS POSITION
WOULD BE ABOUT LEGACY AND HE
ALSO... FROM A MENTORING POINT
OF VIEW HE WANTED TO HELP ME
FROM THE PROJECT.
FOR QUITE A WHILE HE THOUGHT I
WAS ONLY WORKING ON MY
DISSERTATION SO HE WAS HAPPY TO
FACILITATE THAT AS HE DID WITH
MANY OTHER YOUNG STUDENTS.
>> Jon: LET'S GO BACK TO THE
RUNNING THING.
I HAVE FOUND ON RUNS...
(LAUGHTER).
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT
INTERVIEWS BECAUSE I'M HAVING
TROUBLE, I GUESS, WITH, LIKE
A... I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT A
BURNING SENSATION IN MY CHEST.
(LAUGHTER)
SO I CAN'T BREATHE.
HOW... IS IT... WHAT IS IT...
DOES HE DROP HIS... DO YOU EVER
FEEL LIKE HE DROPS HIS GUARD
WITH YOU?
HOW MUCH OF IT DO YOU THINK WAS
HIM PROTECTING A LEGACY.
LIKE AT A CERTAIN POINT LIKE TEN
MILES IN WAS HE EVER LIKE "I
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!
I FAILED EVERYONE THAT EVER
LOVED ME!"
LIKE ANYTHING?
>> NO DIRTY SECRETS.
HE WOULD JUST PICK UP THE PACE
SO NEITHER OF US COULD TALK.
>> Jon: PEACHES.
HOW DOES HE GET ALONG WITH... DO
THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CHAIN OF
COMMAND RESENT HIS SUCCESS?
HIS REPUTATION?
IS THAT A DIFFICULT THING?
I KNOW IT'S A POLITICAL WORLD.
>> SURE, HE REALIZES THAT HE'S
SEEN A BIT AS AN AMBITIOUS
INDIVIDUAL.
YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO'S
AMBITIOUS AND DRIVEN AND HAS A
WILL TO WIN.
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHO YOU
WANT AND THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP
JOHNS HE'S BEEN IN AND I THINK
IT'S PUT SOME OF HIS PEERS AT
ODDS WITH HIM BUT IN THE SAME
SENSE IT'S COMMANDED GREAT
RESPECT.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SENIOR
MILITARY LEADER OR ANYONE WHO'S
WORKED CLOSELY WITH HIM THAT
WOULDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE HE GOES ALL
INTO WHAT HE DOES TO HELP THE
ORGANIZATION SUCCEED.
>> Jon: THIS STRIKES ME AS ONE
OF THOSE STORIES.
IF THIS WERE... IT'S HARD NOT TO
IMAGINE HIM RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
IT'S HARD NOT TO IMAGINE SOMEONE
IN THIS POSITION RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
DO YOU THINK THAT IS THE... SEE,
YOU'RE SMILING AS THOUGH THAT
CAME UP AT LIKE MILE 15.
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE AT WHAT... IS HE RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT AT SOME LEVEL?
SOME... IS HE THAT... HE'S A
LONG-TERM STRATEGIC THINKER.
>> NO, HE'S NOT.
MY HUSBAND WANT MISS TOE SAY HE
IS BECAUSE IT WILL SELL MORE
BOOKS.
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY, HONEY, I COULDN'T DO IT.
(LAUGHS)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THAT WAS THE MOST
AWESOME SELLOUT I HAVE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE!
THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE LIKE I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO DO IT... "HONEY, I
CAN'T!
I JUST CAN'T DO IT!"
SO INTEGRITY'S RUNNING IN THE
WHOLE FAMILY, I GUESS.
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO.
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL
BREAK.
THERE'S A GREAT JUICY ANECDOTE
IN THERE ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR THE
PRESIDENCY.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.
"ALL IN" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES.
WHEN WE COME BACK WE HAVE A
THING WE'RE GOING TO DO TO RAISE
SOME MONEY FOR SOME WOUNDED
WARRIORS AND IT'S A PHYSICAL
CHALLENGE SO MY GUESS IS...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MY GUESS IS I'M GOING TO END UP
OWING MORE MONEY THAN PAULA IS.
(LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING
ON THE PROGRAM.
THE BOOK IS "ALL IN."
PAULA BROADWELL.
