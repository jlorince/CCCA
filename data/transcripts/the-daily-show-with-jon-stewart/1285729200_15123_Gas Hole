YOU KNOW, OUR NATURAL RESOURCES
MUST BE CARED FOR OR TREASURES.
IF WE DON'T DO THAT, SOME OF
THEM COULD DISAPPEAR IN THIN
AIR.
AASIF MANDVI FILED THIS REPORT.

HAS PUSHED US TO THE BRINK.
BUT WE'VE LOT SIGHT OF A GREATER

RUNNING OUT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

ARRRRGH!
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF HELIUM.
OH, MY GOD, HELP US.
THE HELIUM IS RUNNING OUT.
THE HELIUM.
THE HELIUM, OH, MY GOD.

TAKE ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
WAIT A SECOND, WHY DO WE CARE
ABOUT HELIUM?

BIRTHDAY PARTY.
WHAT ISN'T A JOKE IS THAT OUR
HELIUM SUPPLY IS RUNNING OUT.

FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE MORE,
SOMEONE HRELS HAVE TO.
DON'T DO THAT!
>> THE MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT IN
THE UNIVERSE IS?

WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING IS
AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE.
>> RIGHT, LET'S BE OUTLAWS.
[LAUGHTER]
IF SCIENCE WON'T LISTEN TO
REASON, IT WILL MEAN SAYING
GOODBYE TO SOMETHING EVERYBODY
LOVES.
>> I JUST WANTED TO -- WONDERED
WHEN A BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH
CHILDREN WOULD LOOK BHIEK --
LOOK LIKE WITHOUT HELIUM
BALLOONS.
>> THAT WON'T BE MY DEPARTMENT
ANYWAY.
IT'S DECORATORS.
I DON'T I HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST
HELIUM BALLOONS I DON'T
PERSONALLY USE THEM.

WENT PRETTY WELL.
>> NOT BAD.

FOR ALL THIS?
THE CLOWNS IN CONGRESS WHO
MANDATES WE SELL-OFF THE ENTIRE
HELIUM RESERVE BY 2015 LEAVING
FUTURE GENERATIONS TO PAY THE
PRICE.
>> THE COST OF HELIUM IS GOING
TO GO UP DRAMATICALLY.
YOUR PARTY BLOOPS MIGHT COST
$1,000.

PROBLEM IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT.
