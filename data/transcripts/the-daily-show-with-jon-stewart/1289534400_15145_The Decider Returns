[LAUGHTER]
LOOK, DO YOU HAVE A TV?
IF YOU USE IT TO WATCH YOU'VE
BEEN SEEING A LOT OF ON OLD
FAVORITE GEORGE W. BUSH IS OUT
PROMOTING HIS NEW MEMOIR TALKING
TO MATT LAUER AND OPRAH WINFREY.
SHE HAD EVERYBODY LOOK UNDER
THEIR SEATS THEY WERE ALL
DEPLOYED.
GO TO IRAQ.
YOU ARE GOING TO RAMADI.
YOU ARE GOING TO --
[LAUGHTER]
I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW
IS TWO YEARS OF CONTEMPLATION
AND REFLECTION CHANGED OUR
FORMER PRESIDENT?
>> I POISONED DOROTHY'S GOLDFISH
BY POURING VODKA IN THE FISH
BOWL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE QUESTION WAS:  THE
INSPECTORS IN THE REPORT FOUND
NO WEAPONS IN IRAQ.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT TO THAT
ANECDOTE.
IT'S LIKE AN OLD PAIR OF
SLIPPERS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE A GIFT YOU DIDN'T
PARTICULARLY WANT.
WASN'T REALLY A GOOD FIT,
STARTED A WAR BETWEEN YOUR PANTS
AND YOUR SHIRT.
BUT YOU HAD THEM FOR EIGHT
YEARS.
IN BEHINDSIGHT THEY DID KEEP
YOUR FEET SLIGHTER WARMER
THAN -- I NEVER LIKED THOSE
SLIPPERS.
WE SHOULD GO OUT AND BUY HIS NEW
MEMOIR -- IF I DID IT.
IN THAT'S NOT IT.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED WITH TWO
YEARS PERSPECTIVE OUT OF OFFICE.
WHAT ARE HIS FEELINGS ON THE
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE FASCINATING
HINDSIGHT.
>> YOU STOOD UNDER THAT BANNER
WITH A STRONG MESSAGE, MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED.
>> NO QUESTION I MADE A MISTAKE.
IF I DIDN'T GET TO DO IT -- IF I
GOT TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD
HAVE SAID GOOD GOING MEN AND
WOMEN GREAT MISSION OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I THINK HE MIGHT BE
THE COMMANDER OF MATTHEW'S UNIT.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
TWO YEARS.
THE GUY HAD TWO YEARS.
TWO YEARS -- TWO YEARS TO PONDER
A QUESTION YOU KNEW WAS GOING TO
BE ASKED AND THE BEST YOU COULD
COME UP WITH IS GOOD GOING THERE
MEN AND WOMEN.
HAPPY VETERANS DAY, WHATEVER.
INSIGHTS LIKE THAT AND OTHERS
YOU CAN FIND IN THE PRESIDENT'S
NEW MEMOIR "AMERICA:  THE BOOK."
STHAT'S NOT IT.
WHY KNOW WHY THAT KEEPS
HAPPENING.
MEMOIRS ARE SELF SERVING.
YOU GET TO CREATE THE
PARAMETERS.
>> DON'T SELL YOUR SOUL FOR POLL
CONTINUES.
HAVE A SENSE OF PRINCIPLES AND
DEFEND THEM NO MATTER WHAT IT
COSTS YOU.
>> THE KEY THING WAS TO KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T COMPROMISE
PRINCIPLE.
>> Jon: REFUSAL TO COMPROMISE
PRINCIPLE THE HALLMARK OF THE
BUSH PRESIDENCY HE NEVER
COMPROMISED HIS PRINCIPLES THE
DECISION POINT HERE IS ADHERE TO
THE PHILOSOPHY AND SAY LET THEM
ALL FAIL.
>> FREE MARKET.
>> OR DO YOU TAKE TAXPAYERS
MONEY AND INJECT IT INTO THE
SYSTEM IN HOPES THAT YOU PREVENT
A DEPRESSION AND I CHOSE THE
LATTER.
>> I ABANDONED THE FREE MARKET
TO SAVE THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM.
I DID.
I DID.
>> I GUESS THE ONE PRINCIPLE YOU
KIND OF DID ABANDON WAS
CAPITALISM.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT OF COURSE WE ALL AGREE THAT
SOMETIMES PRINCIPLE TAKES A
BACKSEAT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
>> WHY IS WATERBOARDING LEGAL?
>> BECAUSE THE LAWYER SAID IT
WAS LEGAL.
USING THOSE TECHNIQUES SAVED
LIVES.
MY JOB WAS TO PROTECT AMERICA
AND I DID.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHY DID HE DO THAT?
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A LEADER
DOES.
WHEN LIVES ARE IN DANGER, YOU
ASK YOUR LAWYERS TO TELL YOU
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF LAW TO DO
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
IT'S THE SAME THING WITH
KATRINA.
ACTUALLY REMIND ME AGAIN WHY WE
DIDN'T SEND TROOPS INTO
LOUISIANA TO SAVE AMERICAN
LIVES.
>> BY LAW THE PRESIDENT CANNOT
SEND FEDERAL TROOPS IN TO
CONDUCT LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT
A DECORATION OF INSURRECTION AND
OR A REQUEST FROM THE GOVERNOR.
>> Jon: RULES ARE RULES.
[LAUGHTER]
YOUR LAWYERS ALLOWED
WATERBOARDING BUT GOING IN TO
RESCUE HURRICANE VICTIMS, WE'RE
NOT GOING THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOUR LAWYERS JUST LIKED SEEING
PEOPLE UNDERWATER.
WHO IS YOUR LAW FIRM JACOBY AND
AQUAMAN?
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN DOING THE
SHOW?
I HAVE NOT VOMITED ONCE.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS IS THE
ENERGY LEVEL THAT I'M GOING TO
DO THE SHOW FROM NOW ON FOR THE
REST OF MY CAREER.
IT'S LIKE THIS.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
PERHAPS WHAT IS MOST STRIKING IS
THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS ACHIEVED
AN EERIE CALM AFTER PRO--
PRESIDING OVER ONE OF TOUGHEST
PERIODS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
>> A WEEK AFTER THE STORM HIT
NBC HELD A TELETHON ASKING FOR
HELP FOR THE VICTIMS OF KATRINA.
I TROAN DEUCED CAN YES WEST.
WERE YOU WATCHING?
>> NO.
>> DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID?
>> I DO.
HE CALLED ME A RACIST.
IT'S IN THE TRUE AND IT'S ONE OF
THE MOST DISGUSTING MOMENTS OF
MY PRESIDENCY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: CAN YES WEST.
CANNES YES -- KANYE WEST.
AS IN ANY RAP BATTLE THE OTHER
IS INVITED TO RESPOND.
AFTER THE BUSH INTERVIEW KANYE
GOT INTERVIEWED BY MATT LAUER.
>> I WOULD TELL GEORGE BUSH IN
MY MOMENT OF FRUSTRATION I
DIDN'T HAVE THE GROUNDS TO CALL
HIM A RACIST.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
WELL IN, SIR.
NICELY DONE.
I THINK IT IT WAS A REASONABLE
APOLOGY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO GO BACK ON
THE "TODAY" SHOW, SHOW HIM
KANYE'S APOLOGY.
>> WE AS HUMAN BEINGS DON'T
ALWAYS CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS.
>> HE SEEMS TO HAVE REGRET?
DOES YOUR FAITH ALLOW TO YOU
FORGIVE KANYE WEST.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
OF COURSE IT DOES.
I'M IN THE A HATER.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I HAVE OCCASIONALLY ON
OCCASION HATED THE PLAYER BUT IT
WAS NEVER THE GAME.
NEVER THE GAME.
[LAUGHTER]
LAUER SWAWSH -- GOT SQUASHED THE
BEEF.
IF ONLY HE WAS AROUND BETWEEN
HIS FATHER'S BEEF WITH BIGGIE
SMALLS.
I'M TOLD TOLD THE C.I.A. SAYS
THERE'S NO CONNECTION WITH THE
DEATH OF BIGGIE SMALLS.
THIS IS PART OF THE TELL-ALL
MEMOIR IF I MAY --
