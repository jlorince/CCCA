>> WELCOME BACK.
AMERICAN MILITARY IS THE
GREATEST FORCE IN THE WORLD,
OTHER THAN MAYBE GRAVITY BUT
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
DISTURBING REVELATIONS OF
LATE.
>> MAY WAS A BAD MONTH FOR
ITS MILITARY.
THERE WERE A SERIES OF
INCIDENTS THAT REVEALED A
SEXUAL ASSAULT PROBLEM THAT
APPEARED OUT OF CONTROL.
>> SEXUAL ABUSE ACCIDENTS
ARE INCREASING, 26,000
REPORTED LAST YEAR.
>> 26,000, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT IS PRECISELY 27,000
MORE INCIDENTS THAN THERE
SHOULD BE.
BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE
NEGATIVE 1,000 SEXUAL ABUSE
INCIDENTS WHEN IT COMES TO
INVOLVING OUR MILITARY
PERSONNEL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> AFTER EVERYTHING THEY DO
FOR OUR COUNTRY THEY DESERVE
MAGICAL, MAJESTIC CONSENSUAL
SEX WITH UNICORNS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, TO HIS
CREDIT, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS
MADE IT CLEAR THAT WILL NOT
TOLERATE SEXUAL ASSAULT.
>> WE FIND OUT SOMEBODY IS
ENGAGING IN THIS STUFF, THEY
HAVE GOT TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.
PROSECUTED, STRIPPED OF
THEIR POSITIONS,
COURT-MARTIALED, FIRED,
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED,
PERIOD.
>> WELL SAID.
WELL SAID.
PERIOD.
PERSONALLY, I ALSO WOULD
HAVE GONE WITH AN
EXCLAMATION POINT AFTER THAT
PERIOD.
MAYBE AN ELLIPSIS TO CREATE
SUSPENSE AND FROWNY EMOTICON
BUT WE BASICALLY AGREE.
WE BASICALLY AGREE.
THIS IS CLEARLY A GOOD
THING.
STATEMENTS THIS STRONG FROM
THE COMMAND NEVER CHIEF CAN
ONLY BRING THE PROBLEM TO A
QUICKER RESOLUTION WITH
ABSOLUTELY NO UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES.
>> A MILITARY JUDGE WHOSE
HEARING A PAIR OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT CASES SAYS HE'S BEEN
HAMSTRUNG BY STATEMENTS FROM
PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAUSE WHAT
HE CALLS UNLAWFUL COMMAND
INFLUENCE.
>> THE IMPACT OF PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S COMMENTS ABOUT
SEXUAL ASSAULT, SAYING THEY
SHOULD BE PROSECUTED,
STRIPPED OF THEIR POSITIONED,
COURT-MARTIALED, FIRED AND
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED AND
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF
CASES WHERE MILITARY DEFENSE
LAWYERS HAVE CITED THAT AS
COMMAND INFLUENCE.
>> WHAT?
LOOK, LOOK, I'M NO BIG CITY
LAWYER.
I'M NOT EVEN A SMALL TOWN
LAWYER OR INDEED, A LAWYER.
BUT HOW IS THE PRESIDENT'S
UNLAWFULLY INFLUENCING A
CASE BY SAYING THAT PEOPLE
GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
SHOULD BE FOUND GUILTY.
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE
MORE NEUTRAL THAN THAT, JUST,
OH, MAYBE GUILTY PEOPLE
SHOULD BE PUNISHED OR MAYBE
REWARDED.
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT REALLY MY PLACE TO
COMMENTS ON THE MILITARY AS
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
BUT ITS PRESIDENT ISN'T THE
ONLY ONE SPEAKING ON THIS.
THE SITUATION HAS BECOME SO
BAD THAT CONGRESS IS
ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
>> AMERICA'S MOST POWERFUL
MILITARY LEADERS WERE
ORDERED TO CAPITOL HILL
TODAY TO ANSWER FOR THE
EPIDEMIC OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS
IN THE RANKS.
>> THIS UNPRECEDENT SHOWS
LEADERSHIP AT A CAPITOL HILL
HEARING TODAY, A DOZEN TOP
COMMANDERS FROM ALL FOUR
BRANCHES OF THE ARMED FORCES
WERE THERE.
>> WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THE
SENIOR OFFICERS WHO MARCHED
INTO THE COMMITTEE ROOM WERE
ALL MEN.
>> OH, GOOD, GOOD.
ANY TIME YOU WANT A PANEL
CONVENED TO COMBAT SEXUAL
ASSAULT, YOU WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IT IS FILLED WITH
OLD MEN RAISED IN AN ERA
WHERE YOUR FEMALE
SECRETARI
