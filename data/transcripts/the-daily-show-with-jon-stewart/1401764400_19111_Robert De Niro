BOOM YOU KILL IT. NUMBER THREE,THIS MOVIE THIS FILM.
I HAVE SEEN YOUR FATHER'S ARTWORK IN THE HOTEL IN GREENWICH.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I DID NOT REALIZE THE EXTENTTHAT HE WAS ON THE VANGUARD OF
ARTISTIC MOVEMENTS INAMERICA IN THE 1940s.
>> YA, HE WAS A WELL REGARDEDYOUNG ARTIST ON THE UPSWING, IF
YOU WILL.
WELL RESPECTD AND SO ON.
THEN HE WENT TO EUROPE FOR ABOUTFIVE YEARS.
AND, THINGS CHANGED DURING THATTIME.
SO, THE DOCUMENTARY EXPLAINS ITALL.
>> RIGHT.
>> WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ARTSCENE.
>> DID YOU RESPECT HISINTEGRITY, THOUGH, TO NOT CHASE
HIS TAIL. THERE WAS NEVER AMOMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW,
HIS WORK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,IT'S CONSISTENT AND BEAUTIFUL.
THERE ISN'T A MOMENT WHERE HE'SLIKE WHAT IF I PAINT SOUP CANS.
THROW IN A CARTOON SUPERMAN ANDDO A COUPLE OF THINGS.
>> NO, HE FELT STRONGLY THAT WASNOT, THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED
TO DO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE FELT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE FELT.
PERIOD.
HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT -- DIDN'TKNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
>> IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE YOURFATHER.
IN A FIELD OF ARTISTRY.
THINGS BEING JUDGED SUBJECTIVELYTO SEE HIM GO THROUGH DISTRESS
ON IT.
YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THINK OH,REJECTION.
I WANT TO GET IN ON THAT ALITTLE BIT.
LET ME GO INTO THE ARTS. WASTHERE EVER A MOMENT YOU
THOUGHT TO YOURSELF, I CAN'T,I'M LOOKING AT WHAT THIS TYPE OF
SUBJECTIVITY DOES TO MY FATHER.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DEAL WITHTHAT.
>> NO, I NEVER EQUATED THE TWO.
WHAT I WOULD GO THROUGH AS ANACTOR, YOUNG ACTOR, GOING TO
AUDITIONS.
I ALWAYS LOOKED AT ITOPTIMISTICALLY.
I SAY IF YOU DON'T GO YOU NEVERKNOW.
HAVE TO GO TO AUDITIONS.
YOU KNOW YOU WON'T GET THE PART.
YOU HAVE TO GO IN THERE AND HANGIN THERE.
IT WAS NOT, IT WAS JUST FOR ME,I DIDN'T THINK OF HIM.
I DIDN'T THINK OF HIM, I GUESS IHAD TO IN SOME WAYS, BEING
REJECTED WHEN I SAWTHAT HE WAS UNHAPPY
AND ESPECIALLY  WHEN I WENT TOEUROPE AND MADE HIM COME BACK.
I FELT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DOTHAT.
SO, YA.
>> DID YOUR SUCCESS EVERCOMPLICATE THINGS WITH HIM.
>> HE WAS PROUD OF ME, OFCOURSE.
HE -- HE MIGHT OF FELT FROM TIMETO TIME HERE AND THERE WISH HE
HAD SUCCESS, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS AVERY LOVING FATHER AND PROUD.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST WHAT ITWAS.
>> IT'S SO INTERESTING TO WATCHA PROUD SON TALK ABOUT HIS
FATHER'S WORK IN THE WAY THATYOU DO.
THEN TO SEE IT, YOU HAVE THEHOTEL IN GREENWICH, A LOT OF HIS
WORK IS UP.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> THANK YOU.
>> IT MUST -- WHAT IS THEFEELING OF BEING ABLE THROUGH
YOUR PLATFORM TO EXPOSE HISWORK?
>> WELL, I FEEL IT'S LIKE, YOUKNOW CERTAIN THINGS, DO YOU NOT
SHOW ART IN A GALLERY?
THIS AND THAT.
I SAID I WANT TO SHOW MYFATHER'S WORK.
IT SHOULD BE SEEN.
I HAVE THESE RESTAURANTS, HOTEL,THESE PLACES TO PUT IT IN.
NOT ALL OF THEM BUT CERTAINPLACES WHERE I FEEL, I ASKED HIM
TO DO THE MENU FOR THE GRILL.
HE DID IT.
I DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD WANT TO.
HE'S VERY PARTICULAR.
I ASKED HIM TO PUT PAINTINGS UP.
HE DID.
HE HUNG THEM HIMSELF IN THEBACK, THE BIG ONES.
>> HE DID IT HIMSELF.
>> YA. AND I EVEN THOUGHT MAYBE,
I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR HE WOULDGO EVERY WEEK OR TWO HE'D
GO WITH FRIENDS AND SIT INBOOTHS IN THE
BACK AND HE WAS SORT OF PROUD OFWHAT THERE WAS THERE.
I KNEW HOW PARTICULAR HE WAS.
SO, I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
>> YA.
>> ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS PASSINGAWAY.
THE MENUS ARE THE SAME.
EVERYTHING IS THE SAME.
I NEVER CHANGED THAT.
IT'S THERE FOR ME, ETERNITY.
>> IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> YOU GET HIS VOICE IN YOURHEAD WHEN YOU PUT HIS STUFF UP
AND THINK HE WON'T LIKE THAT, HEWANTS IT LIKE
THIS. I KNOW HOW HE IS.
>> CERTAIN THINGS HE DIDN'T --HE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF DEALERS AND
I GUESS LIKE AN ACTOR SUSPICIOUSOF CERTAIN PRODUCERS OR STUDIOS.
IT'S THE SAME THING.
I DON'T EQUATE HIS EXPERIENCEWITH MINE IF I EVER HAVE THAT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- I KNEW, IWAS HAPPY BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY
THAT HE WAS ACCEPTING OF THIS,WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
IF I, FOR EXAMPLE, IF HE WASALIVE I WOULD OF HAD HIM DO THE
CREDITS TO A MOVIE.
ODDLY -- COINCIDENCELY, IT'STERRIFIC, THIS GUY WAS FOLLOWING
HIM AROUND IN THE 70s WITH ASUPER 8 CAMERA HE DID, AS YOU
SEE IN THE MOVIE.
HE WRITES "FIN."
HE JUST DID THAT FOR THE FILM.
BUT IT WORKS NICELY FOR THEDOCUMENTARY.
>> IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
A WONDERFUL GIFT HE GAVE TOYOU. IT'S A WONDERFUL GIFT YOU
GAVE TO HIM AS WELL. SO REALLY,IT'S QUITE LOVELY.
