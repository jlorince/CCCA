ANYHOW, THE POINT IS WE NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FIXING WALL STREET, UNACCEPTABLE
RISK AND VOLATILITY ISSUES.
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT HISTORY NEVER REPEATING DOESN'T END THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE FIXED?
RACISM.
BAM!
BA-BAM!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LIKE THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE SHOULD HAVE A TICKER UNDER THE SCREEN JUST TRACKING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND WITH RACISM STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS FIXED, PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF THE CLEARLY
OBSOLETE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965.
>> THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT HAS BEEN THE LAW OF THE LAND FOR NEARLY HALF A CENTURY HELPING TO
ENSURE THAT ARE NOTES ARE NOT -- MINORITIES ARE NOT DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
THE LAW REQUIRES STATES WITH A HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION TO GET FEDERAL APPROVAL BEFORE CHANGING
HOW THEY CONDUCT ELECTIONS.
>> Jon: LIKE IF YOU WANT A LOAN BUT HAVE A HISTORY OF BAD CREDIT YOU MAY NEED EXTRA
DOCUMENTATION OR GET A COSIGNER OR IF YOU WANT TO MOVE NEAR A SCHOOL AND YOU ARE A SEX
OFFENDER, YOU HAVE TO THRAWN BY SOMEONE.
[LAUGHTER]
SHELBY COUNTY, ALABAMA S LEADING THE CHARGE TO STRIKE WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE AN UNFAIR
PROVISION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
THEY ARE HOPING TO BECOME THE JACKIE ROBINSON'S OF PEOPLE WHO HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED
PEOPLE LIKE JACKIE ROBINSON.
>> TODAY SHELBY COUNTY ALABAMA CHALLENGED THE LAW AT THE SUPREME COURT.
>> THE AMERICA THAT ELECTED BARACK OBAMA IS NOT THE AMERICA OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS.
>> Jon: IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AMERICA.
WE HAVE CELL PHONES NOW AND THINGS COST MORE THAN A NICKLE.
COCA-COLA NO LONGER HAS COCAINE IN IT ALTHOUGH -- YOU HAVE TO BUY IT SEPARATELY.
AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE 16 OUNCES OF OTHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHELBY -- PEOPLE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?
SODA ADDICTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHELBY COUNTY AL ALABAMA IS THAT SINCE AMERICA ELECTED A BLACK MAN IPSO FACTO WE'RE FREE NOW OF RACISM.
ALTHOUGH I GUESS COROLLARY WOULD BE BY THEIR OWN REASONING IF YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM E OH, YEAH, OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS SHELBY COUNTY ALABAMA SEES THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT LESS AS AN EFFECTIVE BULL
WORTH LESS EFFECTIVE AND MORE LIKE ORTHODONTA, NICE BUT NO LONGER NEEDED IN NEEDED IN THE SOUTH.
MEANING IT'S STRAIGHTENED OUT THE PROBLEM AND YOU CAN REMOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S STRAIGHTENED.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME ANY STATE ON THE LIST OF PREVIOUSLY DISCRIMINATING STATES TRIED TO
COOK UP VOTING SHENANIGANS BUT WERE STOPPED.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS REJECTED I.D. LAWS IN TEXAS AND SOUTH CAROLINA.
>> Jon: YEAH BUT THAT WAS LAST YEAR.
IT WAS LIKE SIX TAYLOR SWIFT BREAKUP SONGS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT ISN'T THAT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS STOPPING DISCRIMINATION BEFORE IT
HAPPENS, IT'S WHY CAN'T WE GO BACK TO THE OLD MODEL OF DISCRIMINATING FIRST AND
STOPPING IT LATER?
[LAUGHTER]
AS DIVISIVE AS THIS ISSUE IS IMAGINE THE RENEWAL OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS IN THE SENATE.
>> THE SENATE VOTED TO TO RENEW THE LANDMARK VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
THE VOTE WAS 98-0.
>> Jon: IS THAT EVEN ALLOWED IN THE SENATE ANYMORE?
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET A UNANIMOUS VOTE IN THE SENATE?
THEY COULDN'T PASS ICE CREAM APPRECIATION DAY BECAUSE SENATOR CRAPO IS LACTOSE INTOLL RENT AND
SENATOR INHOFE READ IT MAKES YOU GAME IT'S BEN AND MARY NOT BEN AND JERRY.
ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S THE LAW THAT SHELBY COUNTY HAS A PROBLEM WITH, THE EFFECTIVE POPULAR ONE.
THE ONE BOTH ITS SENATORS ALABAMA VOTED TO RENEW.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO SELL THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
TO THE SUPREMES!
>> GO TO THE COUNTY WHOSE RECORD IS THE EPITOME OF WHAT CAUSED THE PASSAGE OF THIS LAW TO START WITH.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: PERHAPS -- NO, NO, WAIT, I THINK I HAVE A REASON, THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
(bleep).
[LAUGHTER]
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR APPEARS TO BE UPHOLDING THE STATUTE.
>> IS IT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THAT CITIZENS IN THE SOUTH ARE MORE RACIST THAN
CITIZENS IN THE NORTH.
>> Jon: NO, WE'VE BEEN TO BOSTON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH.
AND MY GRANDPARENTS HOUSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WOULD PUT PERSONAL NORTHERN RACISM UP AGAINST ANYBODY'S RACISM.
IT'S NOT ABOUT PERSONAL PREJUDICE IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION AND IF THE LAST
ELECTION IS ANYTHING TO GO BY IT SHOULD BE EXPANDING NOT CONTRACTING.
>> PENNSYLVANIA LAWMAKERS PASSED A VOTER I.D. LAW IN MARCH.
>> WISCONSIN PUT IN PHOTO I.D.
LAWS WHICH CRITICS SAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR MINORITIES AND THE POOR TO VOTE.
>> NEW VOTING RESTRICTIONS IN OHIO.
>> THE REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE WANTED TO CLOSE EARLY VOTING IN THE WEEKEND LEADING UP
TO THE ELECTION.
>> OHIO REPUBLICANS FAILED IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO EXPAND VOTING HOURS IN REPUBLICAN AREAS THAN
CUTTING THEM BACK IN DEMOCRATIC AREAS.
>> Jon: WHAT MORE DOES OHIO HAVE TO DO TO GET ON THE LIST OF STATES?
REPLACE VOTING MACHINES WITH SHREDDERS.
SO FAR IT'S BEEN AN INTELLIGENT RESPECTFUL MANNER.
MAYBE DESCRIBING WHY THEY THINK THE SENATE RENEWED IT UNANIMOUSLY.
SCALIA.
GIVE IT A GO.
>> IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT WHEN A SOCIETY ADOPTS RACIAL ENTITLEMENTS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET THEM OUT THROUGH THE NORMAL POLITICAL CONGRESS.
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF QUESTION YOU LEAVE TO CONGRESS.
THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE VOTES IF THEY DO NOT ENREENACT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
THE NAME IS WONDERFUL.
>> Jon: CONGRESS IS TOO FRIGHTENED TO CHALLENGE IT BASED ON AT PEEL OF ITS NAME.
I'M ASSUMING HE WOULD STRIKE DOWN THE SIGNERS OF DECORATION OF INDEPENDENCE UNDER THE SAME LOGIC.
I BELIEVE IF JOHN HANCOCK SIGNED THE I WISH OUR TEA WAS CHEAPER.
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO WORK WITH THAT GUY?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
