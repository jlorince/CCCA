>> Jon: GET A HAIR CUT, HIPPY.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
GOVERNOR ROMNEY APPEARS --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOVERNOR ROMNEY APPEARS TO HAVE
MADE THE CALCULATED DECISION
THAT HIS BELLICOSE AND HAWKISH
PERFORMANCES IN THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARIES WOULD BE LESS
APPRECIATED BY THE NORMALS.
BUT HERE'S THE CRAZY PART.
AFTER BASICALLY CASTING OFF WHAT
WERE MONTHS AND WEEKS AGO HIS
BEDROCK PRINCIPLES AND BELIEFS
TO COPY OBAMA'S POLICY POSITION
IN A TRANSPARENTLY CYNICAL
APPEAL TO UNDECIDED, GUESS WHICH
QUALITY ROMNEY CHOSE TO
HIGHLIGHT AS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE TWO MEN?
>> LEADERSHIP.
WE SHOULD BE PLAYING THE
LEADERSHIP ROLE.
AMERICA MUST LEAD.
WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP.
REAL LEADERSHIP.
I'D LIKE TO BE THAT LEADER.
>> FOLLOW ME!
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND THE
PRESIDENT!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
I'VE GOT TO SAY, BY THE END OF
LAST NIGHT I WAS BEGINNING TO
WORRY WE WERE IN SOME KIND OF
"FREAKY FRIDAY" SITUATION WHERE
BARACK OBAMA -- THEY SOMEHOW
PEED IN THE SAME FOUNTAIN AND
SWITCHED BODIES OR JUST --
(LAUGHTER).
REMEMBER TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN
ROMNEY WAS THE ONE WHO WAS ALL
CONFIDENT AND STARING DAGGERS AT
OBAMA AND THE PRESIDENT WAS
LOOKING AT SOME RAPTUROUS
DREAMLAND THAT ONLY HE COULD
SEE?
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, LAST NIGHT IT WAS OBAMA
DELIVERING THE DEATH STARE WHILE
ROMNEY SUDDENLY FOUND SOMETHING
ON HIS PODIUM INCREDIBLY
FASCINATING.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
OBAMA WHO, AS WE ALL REMEMBER,
WAS (BLEEP)ING ASLEEP DURING THE
FIRST DEBATE WAS HITTING ROMNEY
LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE ZINGERS.
>> WELL, GOVERNOR ROMNEY IS
RIGHT, YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH
JOBS BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS
BECAUSE YOU INVESTED IN
COMPANIES THAT WERE SHIPPING
JOBS OVERSEAS.
>> Jon: BOOM!
>> YOU MENTIONED THE NAVY, FOR
EXAMPLE, AND THAT WE HAVE FEWER
SHIPS THAN WE DID IN 1916.
WELL, GOVERNOR, WE ALSO HAVE
FEWER HORSES AND BAYONETS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: BAM!
>> THE BIGGEST GEOPOLITICAL
THREAT FACING AMERICA YOU SAID
RUSSIA.
NOT AL QAEDA, YOU SAID RUSSIA.
AND THE 1980s ARE CALLING TO
ASK FOR THEIR FOREIGN POLICY
BACK.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: WELL, THAT WAS A
LITTLE HACKIE.
I MEAN THAT WAS -- THAT WAS A IT
WILL ROASTY.
I WOULDN'T (BLEEP) YOUR FOREIGN
POLICY WITH MARGARET THATCHER'S
(BLEEP), COME ON!
HICKORY DICKORY DOCK, YOUR
GEOPOLITICAL UNDERSTANDING CAN
SUCK MY --
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY.
THAT'S -- NO, PLEASE DON'T
BECAUSE THEN I'LL DO IT AGAIN
SOME NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE PRESIDENT HAD A GOOD
NIGHT.
MUST HAVE FELT PRETTY CONFIDENT
BECAUSE HE WAS LETTING HIS
PROFESSOR OR Y'ALL SIDE SHINE
THROUGH.
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO ONE
COUNTRY.
>> WE'VE CREATED PARTNERSHIPS
THROUGHOUT THE REGION TO DEAL
WITH EXTREMISM.
IN SOMALIA, IN YEMEN, IN
PAKISTAN.
>> Jon: WHAT?
REALLY?
(LAUGHTER)
PAH-KEE-STAHN?
REALLY?
SUDDENLY YOU'RE A GUY WHO'S
DESPERATE TO PROVE YOU ONCE
ROOMED WITH A FOREIGN EXCHANGE
STUDENT?
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK, THIS IS AMERICA, WE DON'T
USE THE PRONUNCIATION LOCALLY.
WE DON'T SAY MAY-HEE-CO OR
FRAHNCE.
MEXICO, FRANCE.
PAKISTAN.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL IN ALL LAST NIGHT MADE A
FINE CONCLUSION, THOUGH, TO THE
ILOGY OF DEBATES BETWEEN THETR
TWO CANDIDATES EAGER ACCEPTANCE
OF REMOTE CONTROLLED HELLFIRE
DRONES TO ACHIEVE THAT END.
WE LEARNED MITT ROMNEY HAS
BASICALLY COME AROUND TO BARACK
OBAMA'S POSITION ON FOREIGN
POLICY AND BARACK OBAMA'S COME
AROUND TO THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY ON
AGGRESSION OVERSEAS BUT DON'T
WORRY, PEOPLE.
>> THE FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE OF
THE THREE DEBATES I ASSUME THIS
WILL BE THE LEAST WATCHED OF THE
THREE.
>> SO MANY VOTERS IN RECENT
POLLS HAVE SAID THEY DON'T CARE
ANYTHING ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY.
>> YES OR NO, THIS DEBATE
MATTER?
>> I
