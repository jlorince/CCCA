GET HANDS-ON WITH THIS DAMNED THING.
LET'S GET TO THE NEWS.
THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERYBODY'S LIFE WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH A CHOICE, WHETHER YOU
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEX AT YOUR DESK AT WORK OR REMAIN EMPLOYED.
IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.
>> THE DRAMATIC FALL FROM GRACE OF ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MILITARY MEN OF THIS GENERATION
>> Jon: DON'T BE AMERICA ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MILITARY MEN OF THIS GENERATION.
C.I.A. DIRECTOR AND RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS STEPPED DOWN FRIDAY AFTER ADMIT
TO GO AN EXTRA MARITAL AFFAIR.
>> Jon: IT WAS CAPTAIN AMERICA.
THE FOUR-STAR GENERAL AND CURRENT C.I.A. DIRECTOR CAUGHT IN A WEB OF SEXUAL INTRIGUE.
C.I.A. DIRECTOR, PERHAPS, THIS ISN'T A SEXY SOVIET AGENT WITH ONE OF THEM NAUGHTY INNUENDO
NAMES LIKE SONNIA VAGINOV OR NATALIE FELLATIOVICH.
AND HIS CON VAIVEING PARAMORU TOLD ON HIM.
IS THAT HOW THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS?
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MULTIPLE U.S. OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS THAT EMAILS BETWEEN HIM AND
PAULA BROADWELL, HIS BIOGRAPHY WERE INDICATIVE OF AN EXTRA MARITAL AFFAIR.
>> Jon: REALLY?
EMAIL?
ALL THEY HAD TO DO TO NAB AMERICA'S SPY-MASTER GENERAL IS LOG TO HIS EMAIL?
WE CAN INTRIGUE THAT LITTLE SOUND BITE UP A LITTLE BIT?
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MULTIPLE U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS THAT EMAILS BETWEEN HIM AND
PAULA BROADWELL HIS BIOGRAPHER WERE INDICATIVE OF AN EXTRA MARITAL AFFAIR.
>> Jon: HOW EXCITING.
WAIT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE WOMAN INVOLVED IS PETRAEUS' BIOGRAPHER PAULA BROADWELL.
WHY DOES THAT NAME SEEM SO FAMILIAR TO ME?
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM PAULA BROADWELL.
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
OH, WAIT.
THAT IS IT.
BY THE WAY, IN CASE ANYONE OUT THERE THOUGHT I MAY HAVE ACTUAL JOURNALIST INSTINCTS, I GIVE YOU
A QUICK SNIPPET OF MY INTERVIEW.

HE LOVES SERVING.
HE LOVES TO BE IN THE ARENA
>> I THOUGHT I WOULD TEST HIM BUT HE WOULD TEST ME.

IT WAS BACK IN THE SWIMMING POOL.
FROM A MENTORING POINT OF VIEW WANTED TO HELP ME WITH THIS PROJECT.
HE CAN TURN WATER INTO BOTTLED WATER
>> Jon: THE WHOLE THING WAS INNUENDO AFTER INNUENDO.
THE WHOLE TIME I'M LIKE DUH.
I HAD HER RIGHT THERE TALKING ABOUT PETRAEUS AND IT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND.
THE WHOLE TIME.
I WAS JUST STARING AT HOW DEFINED HER ARMS WERE AND TRYING TO THINK OF ANOTHER VERSION OF
MY CLASSIC I'M AN ASTHMATIC JOKE.
I'M THE WORST JOURNALIST IN THE WORLD.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, THE TITLE OF HER BOOK WAS "ALL IN." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CALLED THE
BOOK WHAT'S GOT TWO THUMBS AND IS BANGING HIS BIOGRAPHY?
OR AT LEAST I SHOULD HAVE NOTICED HOW SHE WAS FOOTNOTING HER INFORMATION.
POWERFUL MAN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUCCUMBING TO DESIRE.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO FIND CREDIBLE PEOPLE TO SPEAK TO THIS TYPE OF SITUATION
>> NEWT GINGRICH IS A FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.

GET ME GINGRICH.
