LEAP WAS A REALLY GOOD SHOW.
(LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, HERE'S THE SADDEST PART.
DESPITE ROMNEY'S BEST EFFORTS AT LYING THE ONLY CATEGORY OBAMA DEFEATED ROMNEY IN WAS THE BIGGEST LIE OF THE NIGHT.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GRADE THE TWO OF YOU AND SAY YOUR ANSWERS HAVE BEEN TOO LONG OR I HAVE DONE A POOR JOB.
>> YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LOOK, YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET THIS.
I HONESTLY DON'T GET THIS, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SEEM EITHER ANNOYED TO BE THERE OR RELUCTANT TO MAKE YOUR
CASE BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE A CASE CAN.
WHICH WOULD BE A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE.
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO DO THIS TO YOU, SIR, COMMAND NEVER CHIEF, HI, MR. PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, LOOK, I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DREAD HAVING TO SPEND 90 MINUTES DEBATING SOME KNUCKLE HEAD FROM
HARVARD WHO IS JUST GOING TO TO-- ALL NIGHT.
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.
I'VE BEEN THERE, OR WILL BE SATURDAY AT 8:00.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO CAMERA ON IN THE GREEN ROOM, RIGHT?
BUT YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, EVERY ONE HAS PARTS OF THEIR JOBS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE AS MUCH.
BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THOSE JOBS.
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF, THINK OF YOUR SUPPORTERS.
LOOK WHAT YOUR PERFORMANCE DID LAST NIGHT TO ONE OF THEM.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS DOING OUT THERE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LET ROMNEY GET AWAY WITH THE CRAP HE THREW OUT.
WHAT WAS HE DOING TONIGHT?
HE WENT IN THERE DISARMED?
WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT?
>> Jon: YOU HAPPY?
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU BROKE CHRIS MATTHEWS.
NOW NOBODY CAN USE HIM.
(APPLAUSE) ADMITTEDLY MATHEWS IS RUNS A NOT A MACHINE, EVERYONE KNOWS HE IS A SIMPLE POTATO BATTERY.
BUT STILL, HE LIKES YOU.
AND EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE YOU WERE SOME WHAT STUNNED AT THE POOR PERFORMANCE.
EVEN OSAMA BIN LADEN FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS WATERY GRAVE WATCHED AND WAS LIKE THAT'S THE GUY THAT KILLED ME?
(LAUGHTER) REALLY?
MR. LOOK DOWN AT THE PAPER ALL NIGHT, SHOT ME IN THE FACE.
HERE'S WHAT'S PERHAPS MOST MADDENING.
FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE INUNDATED THIS COUNTRY WITH URGENT E-MAILS BEGGING FOR
SUPPORT AND MONEY AND ENERGY AND MONEY AND MONEY AND MONEY.
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF E-MAILS, IT'S THE INTENSITY OF THEIR CONTENT THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT.
SAY YOU'RE IN.
YOUR RESPONSE IS CRITICAL.
I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN.
AND BY THE WAY, YOU MADE THAT YOU BUND ANTLEY CLEAR LAST NIGHT-- BUT THE POINT IS THIS, YOU AND YOUR
CAMPAIGN HAVE DEMANDED A LEVEL OF EFFORT, URGENCY AND RELENTLESSNESS FROM YOUR SUPPORTERS.
A LEVEL OF URGENCY AND RELENTLESSLY YOU FAILED TO DISPLAY IN A NATIONAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.
SHOULDN'T YOUR URGENCY AND PASSION BE ON PAR WITH THE URGENCY AND PASSION OF YOUR E-BLASTS?
OR ARE YOU NOT ON YOUR MAILING LIST.
I'M TELLED TO LEAVE WITH YOU THE WISE WORDS OF A NOTED ACTOR WHOSE CAMPAIGN VIRAL VIDEO HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO
MY IN-BOX 1900 TIMES BY SOME FEW OF OUR PASSIONATE FOLLOWERS.
I BELIEVE IT GOES A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
>> WAKE THE [BLEEP] UP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
