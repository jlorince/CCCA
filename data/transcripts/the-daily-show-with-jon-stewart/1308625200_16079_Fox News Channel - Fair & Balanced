>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
MY GUEST FORMER NEW ORLEANS
MAYOR RAY NAGIN.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
MY GUEST THE FORMER NEW
ORLEANS MAYOR RAY NAGIN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: JERRY LEWIS, ALL
RIGHT.
INTERESTING WEEKEND.
SPENT TIME IN OUR NATION'S
CAPITOL.
TOOK ANOTHER CLASSIC PHOTO
OF MYSELF IN FRONT OF THE
WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HELLO!
THE ONLY QUESTION NOW I
GUESS IS WHO SHOULD I
TWITTER THAT TO?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ANYWAY I STOPPED BY
THE OLD FOX NEWS SUNDAY,
SAID I HAD TO MY FRIEND
CHRIS WALLACE.
WE I THOUGHT HAD A
PROVOCATIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT
THE MEDIA.
I SUGGESTED THAT THE TRUE
BIAS OF THE MAINSTREAM NEWS
IS NOT PARTICULARLY LIBERAL
BUT TOWARDS SENSATIONALISM
AND CONFLICT OR AS THE
HUFFINGTON POST PUT IT,
YOU'RE INSANE!
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO
KNOW--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WHAT, WHAT FONT WOULD YOU
USE WHEN MAN LANDS ON MARS?
LIKE--
(LAUGHTER)
I GUESS IN THAT CASE ARIANNA
JUST HAS TO GO DOOR-TO-DOOR
TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES, RING
THEIR BELL AND GO CLICK ON
ME, I HAVE NEWS!
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, WE HAD TO
RE-CREATE THAT PAGE BECAUSE
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS
APPARENTLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT NEWS EVER, THEY
TOOK IT DOWN LIKE AN HOUR
LATER SO WE COULDN'T GET A
SCREEN SHOT.
ANYWAY, A COUPLE OF THINGS
ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW.
ONE, I SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT
THE UNEDITED VERSION ON-LINE
WHERE MY EMOTIONAL STATES
DON'T SEEM TO CHANGE SO
ARBITRARILY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE ARGUMENTS ARE A LITTLE
CLEARER AND A LITTLE LESS
FROM A SCENE OF WOMAN ON THE
VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
SAD CLOWN, HAPPY CLOWN.
MAD CLOWN.
AND TWO, THE UNEDITED
VERSION WHICH IS ON THE WEB
HAD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE
TAKE AWAY MOMENT OF THE
ENTIRE INTERVIEW.
WHERE CHRIS WALLACE ONE OF
THE MORE RESPECTED
INDIVIDUALS AT FOX BASICALLY
GIVES AWAY THE GAME.
>> YOU BELIEVE THAT FOX NEWS
IS EXACTLY THE IDEAOLOGICAL
EQUIVALENT-- OF NBC NEWS.
>> I THINK WE'RE THE
COUNTERWEIGHT.
>> YOU BELIEVE THAT --
>> I THINK THEY HAVE A
LIBERAL AGENDA AND WE TELL
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY.
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
STORY.
WE DON'T-- WE DON'T TELL
BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY.
WE TELL ONE SIDE.
>> THE OTHER SIDE, THE ONE
WE PERCEIVE IS NEVER TOLD.
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW--
(APPLAUSE)
>> NEWS ONLY COMES IN TWO
SIDES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AND IF THE
CONSERVATIVE SIDE ISN'T
BEING TOLD, WHAT'S BEING
TOLD MUST BE LIBERAL.
FOX NEWS ISN'T FAIR AND
BALANCED, IT'S BALANCING THE
SYSTEM, MAN.
DON'T YOU GET IT!
THE SYSTEM'S UNFAIR AND
UNBALANCED!
TO BALANCE THE SYSTEM, FOX
HAS TO BE THE PURIST FORM OF
RIGHT WING RESIN BECAUSE OF
HOW-- BECAUSE OF HOW HEAVY
LEFT WING AMERICA IS.
HOLLYWOOD, COMEDIANS, EVERY
SINGLE NEWS ORGANIZATION,
THE INTERNET, FACT, HISTORY,
SCIENCE, IT'S ALL JUST LEFT
WING BULL [BLEEP], MAN!
EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS
DESIGNED PURELY TO SHUT DOWN
CONSERVATIVES.
BUT DON'T WORRY, FOX ISN'T
GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.
IT'S FOX UNBALANCED?
YEAH.
SERIOUSLY LIKE THEIR EARS
ARE NEARLY TOUCHING THE
FLOOR.
BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE
SYSTEM'S UNBALANCED.
(LAUGHTER)
