RAPE.
ANYWAY, ARE THESE LADYLESS
DISCUSSIONS OF THE BATTLE
BETWEEN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND
FEMALE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE
A SEEMING RELIC OF A DYING
AGE?
TO TRUEY UNDERSTAND THE
COMPLEXITIES WOMEN FACE IN
THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES
LET'S GO TO OUR NEW ROUND
TABLE SEGMENT "JON STEWART'S
EYE ON THE LADIES.">
TONIGHT, OUR PANEL LOOKS AT
THE QUESTION.
IF A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION
PROVIDES INSURANCE TO ITS
SECULAR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD THAT
PLAN INCLUDE CONTRACEPTION?
JON OLIVER, LET'S START WITH
YOU.
>> NO.
>> JASON JONES.
>> HELL NO.
>> AASIF MANDVI.
>> IT'S NOT MEDICINE.
I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
>> Jon: MOVING ON....
>> NO, ACTUALLY, IN MY
EXPERIENCE....
>> YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING
SAY SOMETHING HERE.
>> Jon: JASON JONES.
>> I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR
WOMEN.
>> Jon: HOW SO?
>> I JUST THINK IT'S GOOD FOR
THEM.
IT'S WHAT I THINK.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> WHAT?
>> Jon: BUT BIRTH CONTROL
OFTENTIMES HAS MEDICAL
BENEFITS BEYOND CONTRACEPTION.
THE PILL CAN BE A TREATMENT
FOR OVARIAN SIFTS.
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, PLEASE,
JON.
LET'S NOT SULLY A PERFECTLY
PLEASANT CONVERSATION ABOUT
WHAT IS GOOD FOR WOMEN WITH
TALK OF LADY PARTS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> I BELIEVE THEIR FEMALE
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IS
GOVERNED BY....
>> Jon: THE POINT IS, WHY ARE
CONDOMS IN THE HEALTH CARE
BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE?
THEY'RE NOT A MEDICATION.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWALLOW TWO
EVERYDAY WITH MEALS TO STAVE
OFF FLU.
>> I'M NOT FALLINGú]mAé9ñ THAT
AGAIN.
NO, SIR.
>> THAT WAS BEST CHRISTMAS
PARTY EVER.
GOT YOU.
CHEERS.
>> OKAY.
EXCUSE ME.
YOU GUYS DON'T GET TO DECIDE
WHETHER CONTRACEPTION IS PART
OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE.
EXPERTS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT
IT IS.
>> YIKES.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S HIGH TIDE
AGAIN.
>> EXCUSE ME.
>> I MADE A CAT NOISE IMPLYING
YOU'RE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH
EMOTIONAL VOLATILITY KNOWN TO
OCCUR DURING TIME OF WOMEN'S
MENSES.
>> OH, FOR (BEEP) SAKE.
1
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON THIS TOPIC?
>> WELL, HONESTLY I THINK THAT
WE DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHETHER
CONTRACEPTION IS A PART OF
PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE UNTIL
EXPERTS HAVE ALREADY
ESTABLISHED THAT IT IS.
>> Jon: THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
>> WE WANT TO SEE BOTH SIDES
OF THE ISSUE.
>> OPEN MINDED.
I LIKE THAT IN A MAN.
>> BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
>> YEAH, BOOM, BOOM.
I KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS SOONER.
>> Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE'VE GOT.
JOIN US NEXT WEEK.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
BREAST.
CAN WE TRUST WOMEN TO SELF
EXAMINE?
>> (BEEP).
