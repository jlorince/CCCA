>> Jon:.
>> WE ARE BACK HERE WITH BILLO'REILLY, THE BOOK IS KILLING
JESUS.
IT IS ACTUALLY A HOW TO.
I THINK IT IS VERYINAPPROPRIATE.
SO HERE IS MY -- I HAVE GOT ACOUPLE OF BONES, YOU WANT TO
PICK A BONE.
>> YOU GO AHEAD.
>> Jon: THE SYRIAINTERVENTION, YOU SAY IF WE
DON'T ATTACK THERE, WE LOOKWEAK.
>> WHEN DID I SAY THAT?
>> I THINK ON YOUR PROGRAM LIKETWO WEEKS AGO YOU SAID --
>> IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES AND YOU GO OUT
AND SAY, HEY, IF YOU GAS KIDS WEARE GOING TO COME AND TAKE CARE
OF YOU AND HAMMER YOU, AND THENWHEN THEY GAS THE KIDS AND THE
KIDS ARE DEAD YOU GO, I DIDN'TREALLY MEAN IT.
THAT IS NOT A GOOD IMAGE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO IF I WAS THE PRESIDENTNUMBER ONE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT THE THREAT FIRST OF ALL, IMAY NOT HAVE MADE THE THREAT BUT
>> WHAT A PRESIDENT YOU'D MAKE>> YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
>> WHEN I COME ON THIS PROGRAM IAM THINKING OF THE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES.
>> Jon: YOU'RE JUST TRYING TOSELL BOOKS, LET'S BE FRANK.
SIF I HAD MADE THE COMMENT ANDTHEN HE DID
THE GAS AND THE STUFF CAME INTHAT HE DID, THEN I WOULD HAVE
SENT A FEW -- BOOM. ON HISHAVEARSENALS
A COUPLE OF AIRPORTS, TAKE THEM OUT, IT WOULD
HAVE TAKEN MAYBE TWO HOURS ANDIF YOU DO IT AGAIN, IT IS YOU.
AND THAT'S IT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, SEEING AS YOUSAID THE USE OF CHEMICALS
WEAPONS AND -- WE DON'T KNOW.
THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW.
>> YES, THEY DO.
HE USED THEM.
THEY KNOW.
>> Jon: IF THE U.N. SAYS IT,STEWART, THEY DID IT, OKAY?
>> THEY DID.
THE U.N. -->> Jon: SO YOU SAY BASICALLY
THE IDEA WOULD BE WE LOOK WEAK.
>> YES, WE DO.
>> Jon: IF WE DON'T DO THAT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: BUT WE ARE NOT WEAK.
>> WE ARE NOT?
>> Jon: NO.
>> NO?
>> Jon: WE HAVE THE LARGESTMILITARY IN THE WORLD.
>> OBAMA LOOKS WEAK TO THEWORLD, I THINK THAT'S A FACT,
ALL RIGHT?  HE LOOKS WEAK TO THEWORLD.
>> Jon: BUT WHY DO YOU THINKTHAT IS FACT?
>> BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TAUNTINGUS, STEWART, THEY ARE TAUNTING
AMERICA.
>> Jon: YOU THINK ASSADBASICALLY, ASSAD DID THIS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW ARED LINE A YEAR AGO ABOUT THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: I THINK I AM GOING TOUSE THEM JUST TO PUT IT IN HIS
FACE?
>> NO.
I THINK ASSAD CAN'T CONTROL HISMILITARY AND THE MILITARY DID IT
WITHOUT -- BUT HE IS IN CHARGE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO PART OF THE CALCULATIONTHOUGH IS IF I DEGRADE SYRIA ANY
FURTHER, DOESN'T THAT CREATEMORE CHAOS NO MATTER WHERE THE
CHEMICALS WEAPONS ARE.
>> I DON'T THINK HE CAN DO THAT,IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES AND YOU TELLPEOPLE NOT TO KILL CHILDREN AND
THEY DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION.
>> Jon: BUT THEY ALREADY HADBEEN KILLING CHILDREN AND BY THE
WAY THEY ARE KILLING CHILDRENALL AROUND THE WORLD.
>> IF YOU BASICALLY DEFINE IT ASDON'T DO THIS, THAT'S WHAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID, DON'T USECHEMICAL WEAPONS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ALL RIGHT?  AND HE DOES, YOUHAVE GOT TO BACK IT UP AND SO.
>> Jon: AND SO HETHREATENED MILITARY INTERVENTION
RUSSIA STEPPED IN AND NOW WEHAVE A DEAL ON CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND WE WILL SEE HOWTHAT WORKS OUT.
IF THIS IS A WAY TO AVOID THEMILITARY, ISN'T THAT BETTER
THAN, HEY I SAID IT THAT BUTTHAT IS LIKE TELLING YOUR KIDS,
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE WAY TO DEALWITH A PROBLEM IN SCHOOL IS YOU
SHOULD HIT THE KID.
>> NO THAT IS LIKE TELLING THEKIDS IF YOU DO THIS I AM GOING
TO DO THAT AND IF YOU DON'T DOIT YOU ARE A WIMPY FATHER AND
THEY WILL RUN ALL OVER YOU.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING IS YOUSHOULDN'T TAKE IN ANY OF THE
CHANGING FACTORS YOU SHOULDALWAYS DO WHAT THEY SAY.
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY BEEF WITHTHE WAY IT WORKED OUT AND I
THINK IT IS GOOD THE WAY ITWORKED OUT FOR THE COUNTRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOKSLIKE A WEAK LEADER, HE LOOKS
INSIDE -->> Jon: THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST
SAID, I LIKED THE WAY THISWORKED OUT FOR THE COUNTRY.
>> WE ARE LUCKY.
WE WERE LUCKY.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU KNOW WEWERE LUCKY?
>> BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GETINVOLVED IN A SITUATION THAT
WOULD, COULD HAVE LED TOTERRIBLE THINGS.
ALL RIGHT?  SO -->> Jon: EVERY SITUATION YOU
GET INVOLVED IN COULD LEAD TOTERRIBLE THINGS.
>> YEAH, BUT THIS ONE WASFRAUGHT INSIDE AND OUT BECAUSE
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DIDN'T WANTTO DO IT, AND THE PRESIDENT
DIDN'T CONFER WITH THEM.
HE SCREWED THIS UP, COME ON, YOUCAN'T BE SAYING HE LOOKED GOOD
IN THIS, ARE YOU SAYING -->> Jon: I AM SAYING IT DOESN'T
MATTER HOW HE LOOKS IN THIS,WHAT MATTERS IS RESULTS.
>> IT MATTERS.

COUNTRY, IT IS.

LUNCH MONEY, I'M SORRY, I STILLHAVE TO KICK YOUR ASS BECAUSE I
SAID I WOULD DO IT SO I HAVE TOSHOW THAT I AM RIGID.
>> LOOK IF YOU THINK PRESIDENTOBAMA CAME OFF LOOKING WELL IN
THIS, YOU ARE -->> Jon: I DON'T CARE HOW HE
COMES OFF LOOKING.
THAT IS MY POINT.
I CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THEWORLD.
I DON'T CARE IF HE PUT ON ADRESS AND LIPSTICK AND SASHAYED
HIS PRETTY ASS AROUND THE WHITEHOUSE AND SAID, LOOK AT ME!  I
AM A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL!
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENSDOWN THE ROAD.
>> Jon: ALL I'M SAYING IS,IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOR
WHATEVER HAPPENED, WE AVOIDED AMILITARY CONFRONTATION.

IS TRUE.
