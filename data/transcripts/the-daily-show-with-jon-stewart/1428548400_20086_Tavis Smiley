>> Jon: I'M DOING VERY WELLMYSELF.
>> CAN I SAY THIS RIGHT QUICKTHOUGH?
>> Jon: YES, PLEASE.
>> I MEAN THIS IN ALLSERIOUSNESS.
IT IS DIFFICULT-- .
>> Jon: OH BOY.
>> NO.
>> Jon: ARE YOU FIRING ME?
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> NO, NO, NO. IT IS DIFFICULT,JON STEWART --
>> Jon: YES.
>> TO BE A TRUTH TELLER AND ACROWD PLEASER AT THE SAME
TIME.
>> Jon: YES.
>> YOU HAVE MADE US LAUGH ANDIN DOING SO YOU GOT US TO
LISTEN.
AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: OH STOP.
NOTHING BUT RESPECTFROM ME TO YOU AS WELL.
BUT THANK YOU.
>> LIKEWISE.
>> Jon: AND THIS IS, TALK ABOUTA MILESTONE.
MY JOURNEY-- THIS IS YOUR,AND FOR MOST AUTHORS NEVER
GET THERE, THIS IS YOUR 400thBOOK.
>> NOT EXACTLY.
>> Jon: HOW IN GOD'S NAMEDID A 21-YEAR-OLD KID --
>> Jon: END UP GETTING A MENTORLIKE MAYA ANGELOU?
>> YEAH. IN GOD'S NAME, I DO NOTKNOW.
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I'METERNALLY GRATEFUL.
I BELIEVE THAT GRATITUDE IS THEGATEWAY TO GREATNESS.
AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL THATSHE ALLOWED ME IN HER SPACE.
I MEAN, BY THE TIMEI MET HER SHE WAS ALREADY
AN INTERNATIONAL ICON.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I RAN FOR CITY COUNCIL IN LOSANGELES, SPEAKING OF YOUR
RAHM EMANUEL PIECE, FUNNY BY THEWAY.
>> Jon: THANK YOU. ANDYET ALSO TRAGICALLY SAD.
>> YES, EXACTLY.
I RAN FOR CITY COUNCIL IN L.A.WHEN I WAS A 20 SOMETHING,
I LOST THAT RACE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT IS LAUGHABLE NOW TO THINKTHAT I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS
OVER THEN.
BUT WHEN THE ONLY THING THATYOU THINK YOU WERE BORN TO
DO, YOU FAIL AT, YOU DON'TKNOW WHAT IS NEXT IN YOUR
LIFE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO IN THAT MOMENT WHEN IDIDN'T KNOW WHAT MY NEXT
STEP WAS, I COULDN'T FIND MYOWN VOICE, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE MY PLACE WAS IN THEWORLD, I GET THIS INVITATION
OUT OF THE BLUE --
>> Jon: WOW.
>> TO GO TO AFRICA FOR TWO WEEKSWITH MAYA ANGELOU.
AND ALL I DID FOR TWO WEEKSWAS CARRY HER BAGS AROUND
AFRICA.
I KID YOU NOT.
I CARRIED HER BAGS AROUND.
BUT IT WAS THE MOST SUBLIME ANDJOYFUL EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER
HAD TO BE EXPOSED TO THATKIND OF MIND.
THIS IS AUGUST OF '93.
>> Jon: DID SHE HAVE A PLANFOR YOU?
WAS THERE A MOMENT THEREWHERE YOU THOUGHT, I SEE --
DID YOU KNOW AT THE TIME, WASIT A PURPOSEFUL SHAPING?
DID SHE SEE SOMETHING IN YOU?
BECAUSE I HAVE HAD SIMILARFAILURES AND I WAS MENTORED
BY A FELLOW NAMED JACKDANIELS.
AND HE-- (LAUGHTER)
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT, BUT-- DID YOU GETTHE SENSE THAT SHE WAS BEING
PURPOSEFUL WITH YOU?
>> YEAH. I THINK SHE WAS ALWAYSPURPOSEFUL.
SHE LOVED YOUNG PEOPLE.
THE REASON WHY SHE MOVEDTO WINSTON-SALEM AND
BEGAN TO TEACH AT WAKEFOREST IS BECAUSE SHE LOVED
YOUNG PEOPLE.
SHE SAW HERSELF AS A GIFTAND SHE WAS WILLING TO SHARE
THAT GIFT WITH OTHER YOUNGPEOPLE.
NOW KEEP IN MIND, THIS SAME MAYAANGELOU WAS RAPED WHEN SHE WAS
7 YEARS OF AGE.
THIS IS THE WHOLE STORY OFHER BOOK, HER BEST-SELLER
INTERNATIONALLY, "I KNOW WHY THECAGED BIRD SINGS."
>> Jon: YES.
SHE WAS RAPED AT THE AGE OF7.
SHE DOESN'T SAY A SINGLEWORD, JON, FOR FIVE AND A
HALF WORDS.
SHE GOES MUTE FOR FIVE AND AHALF YEARS. SO IF ANYBODY
UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT MEANS TOBE A YOUNG PERSON, TO
FIGHT TO FIND YOUR VOICE, TOCLAW YOUR WAY BACK, TO FIND
YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD, ANDSHE GOES ON TO BE AN ICON.
I MEAN WE GO TO AFRICA INAUGUST OF '93, THIS IS AFTER
JANUARY OF '93 WHEN SHE HASGIVEN THAT BEAUTIFUL POEM
"ON THE PULSE OF MORNING"AT CLINTON'S INAUGURATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE ONLY PERSON TOHAVE DONE THAT BEFORE HER
WAS SOME GUYNAMED ROBERT FROST.
SHE SHOWS UP TO GIVE THISPOEM BUT FOR SOME REASON SHE
BRINGS ME INTO HER WORLD.
A BEING A YOUNG BLACK MAN ANDHAVING SOMEONE SAY TO ME, YOUR
LIFE MATTERS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOUR OPINIONMATTERS, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS, WHAT ARE YOURVIEWS ABOUT THIS.
SHARE WITH ME, TELL ME YOURLIFE STORY, FOR SOMEBODY OF
HER STATURE TO DO THAT TO MEIS A LIFE-CHANGING,
LIFE-ALTERING, LIFE-AFFIRMINGEXPERIENCE.
>> Jon: AND DO YOU, YOU KNOW,WHEN YOU SEE THE POWER OF
THAT A MENTORING OR ARELATIONSHIP CAN HAVE, YOU
KNOW, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK TOWHEN YOU SAY LIVES MATTER,
THE VIDEO EVEN FROM TODAY OFA BLACK MAN, 50 YEARS OLD,
RUNNING AND BEING SHOT, HOWDO YOU REACH PEOPLE WHO
DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITYTHEN?
WHO CAN'T -- SHE CAN'T TOUCHEVERYBODY.
YOU CAN'T TOUCH EVERYBODY.
HOW DOES THAT MESSAGE GETTHROUGH?
>> WE START BY RECOGNIZINGTHAT AS MAYA SAID TO ME ALL THE
TIME, I AM HUMAN.
AND BECAUSE I'M HUMAN, NOTHINGHUMAN IS ALIEN TO ME.
NONE OF US IS ANY BETTER ORANY WORSE THAN ANY OTHER
HUMAN BEING.
THIS IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUTBLACK AND WHITE.
IT SURELY IS ABOUT IT BUT NOTAS MUCH TO MY MIND ABOUT
BLACK AND WHITE AS IT ISABOUT WRONG AND RIGHT.
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN OURCOUNTRY IS THE CONTESTATION
OF THE HUMANITY OFTOO MANY PEOPLE.
AND WHEN YOU THINK THATBLACK MEN'S LIVES DON'T
MATTER AND THEIR HUMANITY,THEIR DIGNITY CAN BE
CONTESTED, IF THAT ISYOUR STARTING PLACE,
THEN THE ENDING POINT IS ON YOUREIGHT BULLETS IN THE BLACK
LYING FACE DOWN.
NOW HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DIDN'TCARE ABOUT HIS HUMANITY?
BECAUSE HE SHOT HIM LIKE ACOWARD IN THE BACK EIGHT TIMES
AS HE'S RUNNING AWY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DOESN'TCARE ABOUT HIS LIFE?
BECAUSE AS HE IS DEAD ON THEGROUND, YOU ARE SO AFRAID OF
A BLACK MAN, AFTER YOU SHOOT HIMEIGHT TIMES IN THE BACK
AND HE IS FACE DOWN, HE ISDEAD AND YOU STILL HANDCUFF
HIM?
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT HOWYOU REGARD OR DISREGARD THE
HUMANITY OF THAT PARTICULARHUMAN BEING.
AND SO WE'VE GOT TO START TONOT JUST -- HOW AM I TO PUT
THIS -- NOT JUST RESPECT THEHUMANITY OF FELLOW CITIZENS,
BUT TO EVEN REVEL IN THEHUMANITY OF FELLOW CITIZENS.
>> Jon: I MEAN, POWERFULSENTIMENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND DEAD ON RIGHT.
AND IT DID, BUT YOU SEE, YOUKNOW, BUT YOU SEE THE LINKAGE OF
WHAT MAYA ANGELOU STOOD FOR ANDWHAT SHE WAS ABLE TO IMPART
TO YOU AND THE WISDOM.
AND THEN WHAT ARE YOU ABLETO IMPART.
AND IN SOME WAYS I GUESS WHAT IGET AT THROUGH THE WHOLE IDEA IS
IT FEELS LIKE AFTER READINGTHIS, THAT SHE KNEW
POLITICS WAS TOO SMALL FORYOU, TOO A LARGE EXTENT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVEENDED UP NOT HAVING THE
VOICE YOU HAVE BECAUSEIT WOULD HAVE BEEN CENSORED
BY A PROCESS THATIS CORROSIVE --
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: TO THAT TYPE OF FREESPEECH.
AND MAYBE THAT WASULTIMATELY WHERE SHE WAS
TAKING YOU.
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.
I LEARNED FROM HER, JON,THAT SOMETIMES REJECTION IS
DIRECTION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SOMETIMES REJECTION ISREDIRECTION.
MAYA SAID TO ME ALL THE TIME,AND IN THE EPILOGUE TO THE BOOK
I CLOSE WITH THIS, WE FINDOUR PATH BY WALKING IT.
I WANTED HER TO JUST TELL MEIN THAT MOMENT OF DESPAIR AND
DESPONDENCY, WHAT IS MY ROLE?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
HOW DO I FIND MY VOICE?
HOW DO I KNOW THAT I MATTERIN THE WORLD?
JUST TELL ME THE ANSWER TOTHIS QUESTION.
OH WISE ONE.
AND SHE SAID TO ME, BABY, WEFIND OUR PATH BY WALKING IT.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EVERYONE OF US HAS SOMETHING TO
CONTRIBUTE.
AND WHATEVER AGE YOU MIGHTBE, TRYING TO DISCOVER WHO
YOU ARE, OR TRYING TOREDISCOVER AFTER BEING
DOWNSIZED WHAT YOUR ROLE INTHE WORLD IS, THERE IS A
ROLE FOR TO YOU PLAY.
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IFTHERE WEREN'T SOME ASSIGNMENT
UNIQUELY FOR YOU TO DO.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEPWALKING THAT PATH UNTIL YOU
FIND IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WELL, TAVIS, ICAN'T TELL YOU, I REALLY HOPE
YOU FIND IT BECAUSE --
>> I'M WORKING ON IT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: MY JOURNEY WITH MAYA.
IT IS ON THE BOOK SHELVESNOW, TAVIS SMILEY.
