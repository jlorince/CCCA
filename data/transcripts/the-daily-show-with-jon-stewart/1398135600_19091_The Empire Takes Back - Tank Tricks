[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
YOU MAY RECALL LAST MONTH WHENPRO-RUSSIAN MILITIAS TOOK
OVER THE CRIMEAN PENINSULA ANDHANDED IT TO RUSSIA. NOW MANY
THOUGHT THE MILITIAS WERE NOTONLY PRO-RUSSIAN BUT RUSSIAN.
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTINKNEW DIFFERENT.
>> THOSE ARE LOCAL SELF DEFENSEUNITS.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEMAN AT HIS WORD.
COME ON.
LOOK AT THAT FACE.
WOULD THAT FACE LIE TO YOU? DON'T ANSWER THAT
BECAUSE THAT FACE WOULD KILL YOUWITH POISON.
ACTUALLY, THAT FACE DID LIE TOYOU.
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THE MEANTIMESPOKE ON RUSSIAN TV FOR THE
FIRST TIME HE ADMITTED THETROOPS IN UNMARKED UNIFORMS WHO
TOOK CRIMEA BEFORE ITSANNEXATION BY MOSCOW WERE, IN
FACT, RUSSIAN SOLDIERS.
>> Jon: APRIL FOOLS'.
IN FEBRUARY. NOWORDINARILY, I WOULD JUST LET
BY GONES BE BY GONES, BUT HERE'STHE THING, AS OF LAST WEEK
HUGE PARTS OF EASTERN UKRAINEARE NOW FILLED WITH THE SAME
MYSTERY MILITIAS. THEY'RE TAKINGOVER GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS,
AND THEY'RE OCCUPYING THESTREETS, AND NOT
ONLY TAKING UKRAINIAN ARMYTANKS, THEY ARE DOING (bleep)WITH
THEM I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULDDO. I MEAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
MAN, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TOUKRAINE THAT IS AWESOME.
BUT AT LEAST NOW THAT PUTIN ISMORE ACCUSTOMED TO TELLING THE
TRUTH I AM SURE HE WILL LEVEL ASTO RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT.
>> THIS IS NONSENSE.
THERE ARE NO RUSSIAN UNITS INTHE EAST OF THE UKRAINE.
>> Jon: WELL, HIS LIPS SAY NO,BUT THE OTHER GUY THAT WAS
TALKING SAYS --LOOK, HE LIES ALL THE
TIME, SO YOU KNOW WHATWOULD HELP? IF WE HAD SOME
KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF THATTHE MILITIAS IN THE UKRAINE
ARE ACTUALLY RUSSIAN SOLDIERS.
>> NEW PHOTOS PROVIDED TO AEUROPEAN MONITORING BODY AND
PUBLISHED BY "THE NEW YORKTIMES" JUST TODAY GIVE
SOME INSIGHT INTO WHO HAS BEENSEIZING GOVERNMENT SITES IN
EASTERN UKRAINE. THE TIMESSAYS THESE PHOTOS LINK THE
GUNMEN KNOWN AS GREEN MEN TORUSSIA.
>> Jon: REALLY?  THAT IS YOUREVIDENCE?  CHUNKY GUY WITH A
BEARD?  IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYOTHER GUY IN EASTERN EUROPE.
THAT IS EVERY OTHER GUY ON THEPLANET.
LIKE TWO-THIRDS OF ZZ TOP.
I MEAN, COME ON.
I THINK THAT IS LIKE THE GUYTHAT PRODUCED THE BEASTIE BOYS
FIRST ALBUM. LOOK, I AM STARTINGTO THINK RUSSIA HASN'T
INVADED UKRAINE AT ALL AND THISENTIRE INTERNATIONAL CRISIS IS
JUST AN ELABORATE MOCKUMENTARYPRANK BY JOAQUIN PHOENIX.
>> I AM GOING TO NEED MOREEVIDENCE THESE MILITIA MEN ARE
NOT JUST LOCALS.
>> YOU WOULD TALK TO LOCALS INTHESE TOWNS AND THEY WOULD SAY
PEOPLE AT THE BARRICADES
SPEAK WITH RUSSIAN ACCENTS ANDDON'T KNOW THEIR WAY AROUND.
>> Jon: I GUESS THEY WEREN'TDOING DOUGHNUTS IN THE TANKS,
THEY WERE JUST SO LOST THEY WEREDRIVING IN CIRCLES.
>> THEY SAID THERE WAS WAFFLEHOUSE AROUND HERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM GOING.
I AM JUST -- I AM JUST HUNGRY.
>> Jon: SO, NOW THAT WE KNOWTHESE ARE RUSSIANS, THE QUESTION
IS, HOW SHOULD AMERICA DEAL WITHIT AND PLEASE FRAME YOUR ANSWER
WITH THE STUPIDEST OPTION WE CANTAKE.
>> WE NEED TO DO SOME THINGSTACTICALLY.
WE NEED TO GIVE THEM LETHALWEAPONS, GIVE THEM 100 T-72
TANKS FROM NATO STOCKS.
>> Jon: WE DID THAT ALREADYAND THE RUSSIANS TOOK THEM AND
STARTED DOING DOUGHNUTS!  IN THEPARKING LOT OF THE RUSSIAN 7-11!
ISN'T THERE ANYONE IN RUSSIA WHOCAN PIN PUTIN NOW.
>> U.S. FORMER U.S. SPYCONTRACTOR EDWARD SNOWDEN HAVING
HIS FIRST KNOWN PUBLICCONVERSATION WITH VLADIMIRPUTIN.
>> Jon: OH (BLEEP).IT IS THE SNOW MAN! OH, YEAH!
FALCON AND THE SNOW MAN UP INTHIS (bleep)! IF
ANYBODY CAN HOLD PUTIN'S FEET TOTHE FIRE IT IS THIS CAT.
>> DOES RUSSIA INTERCEPT STOREOR ANALYZE IN ANY WAY THE
COMMUNICATIONS OF MILLIONS OFINDIVIDUALS?
>> Jon: OH!  HOW IS OLD VLADDYGOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ONE?
>> WE DON'T HAVE A MASS SYSTEMOF SUCH INTERCEPTION.
AND ACCORDING TO OUR LAW, ITCANNOT EXIST.
>> Jon: TOUCHE.
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHTPUTIN COULD OUTWIT A PRERECORDED
QUESTION FROM A MAN WHOSE LIFEIS IN HIS HANDS?  WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.
