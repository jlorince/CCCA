CLOSE GITMO" OBAMA SAYING, THIS BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THOSE TUESDAY ACTUALLY GETS [BLEEPED]
DONE.
HMM?
SO IF IMMIGRATION REFORM FACES SUCH AN UPHILL BATTLE, WHY IS OBAMA TAKING IT ON NOW?
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY OUR NEW CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL, OUR SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AL, PLEASURE TO SEE YOU.
YOU ARE AND YOU WILL BE... YOU WILL BE OUR SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED SENOR, JON, BUT THANK YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: WELL, IT'S INTERESTING OBAMA IS RAISING THIS WHOLE IMMIGRATION DEBATE NOW.
>> AH, NOT REALLY.
I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE CINCO DE MAYO, JON, ONCE A YEAR YOU GUYS
FEIGN INTEREST IN OUR CULTURE BY ORDERING A PLATTER OF FAJITAS AT
AN APPLEBY'S AND THE NEXT DAY WE'RE BACK TO BEING THE VALET
YOU DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH.
BUT GUESS WHAT, BARACK, WE AIN'T NOBODY'S FAJITAS.
>> Jon: THAT WAS NICE.
YOU ACTUALLY THINK OBAMA THEN IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?
YOU THINK HE'S PANDERING?
>> COME ON, JON, HE'S HAD HIS WHOLE TERM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IMMIGRATION AND HE'S JUST BRINGING IT UP NOW?
THAT WOULD BE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, HAVING YOUR OWN SHOW FOR 12 YEARS, HIRING EVERY RACE,
RELIGION AND CREED OF CORRESPONDENT UNDER THE SUN -- INDIAN, BRITTS, BLACKS, TWO
CANADIANS -- THEN WHEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC NUMBERS BECOME COMPLETELY UNAVOIDABLE, YOU HOPE
TO MAKE UP FOR IT BY GOOGLING "MEXICAN COMEDIAN" AND VOILA.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: THAT WOULD BE QUITE A CYNICAL MOVE.
>> I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE, AND BY THE WAY, I AM A LITTLE OFFENDED
THAT YOUR MAKE-UP LADY COVERED UP MY TEARDROP TATTOO.
>> Jon: I'M SURE SHE WASN'T TRYING TO... DOESN'T THAT MEAN,
THAT TEARDROP TATTOO MEANS YOU KILLED SOMEBODY.
>> ONLY ON THE RIGHT EYE.
ON THE LEFT SIDE IT MEANS I TRIED TO KILL SOMEONE BUT THEY GOT AWAY.
I'M REALLY SAD ABOUT IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OBAMA'S PLAN, AL, DOES SOUND PRETTY REASONABLE.
YOU GET CAUGHT HERE ILLEGALLY,
YOU PAY A FINE, YOU LEARN ENGLISH, YOU HEAD TO THE BACK OF THE LINE FOR CITIZENSHIP.
>> OR AS SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE CALL IT...
>> EXPLICIT AMNESTY.
>> A WAY OF SAYING AMNESTY.
>> AMNESTY OF UP TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE.
>> PAYING THE PRICE FAR CRIME YOU'VE COMMITTED ISN'T AMNESTY.
>> Jon: BUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE STILL COMMITTING A CRIME.
>> OR IS IT ENTRAPMENT?
AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL, PURPLE MOUNTAINS MAJESTY?
THIS PLACE HAS GOT IT ALL.
MEXICANS CAN SEE LAS VEGAS FROM THEIR CASAS, JON.
HMM, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
I CAN GET BEHEADED ON THIS SIDE OF A BORDER FOR DRIVING DOWN A STREET CONTROLLED BY SOME
SCARFACE WANNABE, OR I CAN GO OVER TO THE SHINY PLACE WHERE BIG BOOB BLONDE GIRLS IN DOLPHIN
SHORTS SERVE ME COCKTAILS WHILE I PLAY BLACKJACK.
HIT ME.
>> Jon: I GUESS WE MAKE IT KIND OF HARD NOT TO COME HERE.
>> YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF IT, TOO.
>> Jon: LIKE A CHEAP LABOR FORCE?
>> AND SELF-ESTEEM.
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AREN'T JUST TAKING THE JOBS YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO, THEY'RE TAKING THE STAIR TYPES YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED, LIKE LAZY.
>> Jon: AL, EVERYBODY CALLS AMERICANS LAZY.
>> YEAH, BUT THE GOOD KIND OF LAZY, RICH LAZY, SPREAD OUT ON A
LEATHER COUCH WATCHING "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" WHILE THE ROOMBA VACUUMS YOUR ROOM.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATINO LAZY, NO ES BUENO, JON.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU RESENT THOSE MISCONCEPTIONS?
>> OF COURSE, JUST LIKE YOU REDISENGTDING PEOPLE WHO THINK JEWS CONTROL THE MEDIA.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE MEDIA.
>> WAIT, NOT THE MEDIAN, THE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD?
>> Jon: WE DON'T CONTROL THE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.
PEOPLE SAY WE CONTROL THE MEDIA,
NOT THE MEDIANS.
>> OH, WOW.
SO WE CAN SELL ORANGES WHEREVER WE WANT.
HEY, GUYS, HE SAID IT'S COOL.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, AL.
AL MADRIGAL, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE
