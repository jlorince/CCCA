EVEN CHANGED MY SUIT APPARENTLY.
SPEAKING OF A KNEE TO THE GROIN,
REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
RIGHT AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR
ACTUALLY WHEN THEN PRESIDENT
BUSH CAME TO THE COUNTRY AND
SAID, WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT
ABOUT HOW TO PROSECUTE THE WAR
ON TERROR, WHETHER OR NOT THE
PATRIOT ACT IS LEGAL AND WHILE
WE WERE TALKING, LOOKS LIKE OUR
ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST BOOM.
[LAUGHTER]
I BELIEVE ADDING HE, HE, HE OR
MILLION IS LIKE THAT.
-- SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN'T
REMEMBER HOW THAT GOES.
ANYWAY, IT TURNS OUT THAT OUR
BIG BANKS, JP MORGAN CHASE,
CITIGROUP, BANK OF AMERICA MADE
A BUNCH OF (bleep) MORTGAGE
LOANS AND BUNDLED THEM INTO
BAILS OF (bleep) LOANS THAT
COMPANIES SOLD BACK AND FORTH TO
ONE ANOTHER AT EVER INCREASING
PRICES UNTIL ONE PERSON REALIZED
WE'RE JUST SHOVELING (bleep)
BACK AND FORTH, RIGHT?
AT WHICH POINT THE COMPANIES
CAME TO US AND SAID IF YOU DON'T
GIVE US $700 BILLION EVERYTHING
YOU LOVE AND HOLD DEAR IN THIS
WORLD WILL TURN TO TANG, THE
ORANGE JUICE SUBSTITUTE ONCE
DRUNK BY ASTRONAUTS.
J.P. MORGAN GOT $25 BILLION,
GMAC GOT $16 BILLION.
IN RETURN FOR THIS IN NO WAY
RANSOM MONEY, THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WOULD NOW BE THE PROUD
OWNER OF THESE BAILS OF
(bleep).
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY TROUBLED ASSETS.
[LAUGHTER]
WE WOULD NOW BEAR THE RISK OF
OWNING THESE MORTGAGES AND THE
BANKS, THE GUYS WHO GOT RICH
ORIGINALLY SELLING THE LOANS
WOULD STEP AWAY.
[LAUGHTER]
MERELY JUST SERVE US THE
PAPERWORK, HANDLE THE DRY
ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF IT.
WHAT COULD GO WRANG.
DID I SAY THAT?  I MEANT WRONG.
>> WRONG SIGNATURES, FALSE
DOCUMENTS, FALSE USE OF NOTARY
PUBLICS.
>> ONE ADMITTED TO BLINDING
SIGNING 10,000 FORECLOSURE
AFFIDAVITS A MONTH.
>> THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHETHER WORKERS RUSHED THROUGH
THE PAPERWORK FOR THOUSANDS OF
HOMEOWNERS WITHOUT READING THE
DOCUMENTS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE -- WHAT,
WAIT -- WHAT?
THE BANKSS WEREN'T READING THE
FINE PRINT.
YOU ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP
WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
WE NEVER READ THE FINE PRINT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE DON'T READ THE FINE PRINT ON
ANYTHING.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE LENGTH OF
AN iTUNES CONTRACT?
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO WADE TO
52 PAGES OF CRAP TO GET TO MY
KATY PERRY SONGS.
DR. MR. JOBS, I'VE RETURNED THIS
WILL MARKUPPED iTUNES
CONTRACT.
SUBSECTION 15B CLEARLY VIOLATES
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.
YOU CLICK ACCEPT AND YOU GET
YOUR (bleep) SONG.
SO FOR GOD SAKE WHAT'S IS IN THE
FINEPRINT?
WHAT IS IN THE FINEPRINT
AFFIDAVITS AND SUCH?
>> THESE AFFIDAVITS ATTEMPT TO
TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS.
ONE THAT THEY OWN THE PROPERTY
AND THERE ARE HAD A RIGHT TO
FORECLOSURE AND TWO, THAT THE
PERSON THAT IS THE BORROWER WAS
IN DEFAULT.
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN THE -- YOU
ARE NOT READING THE REGULAR
PRINT.
I IMAGINE NOT KNOWING WHICH
HOUSES ARE ACTUALLY IN DEFAULT
COULD LEAD TO SOME PRETTY WACKY
MISHAPPENS.
>> AN ORANGE COUNTY HOMEOWNER
THOUGHT A BURGLAR WAS BREAKING
IN BUT IT WAS SOMEONE FROM THE
BANK.
>> A MAN FROM THE BANK WAS
REPLACING THE LOCK WHILE CUTTING
IT WHILE THE HOMEOWNER WAS
DIALING 911.
>> A SPOKESPERSON TOLD ME THE
BANK MADE A MISTAKE.
>> REALLY?
A MISTAKE?
SPOKESPERSON TOLD YOU THAT.
IT'S A MISTAKE TO CHANGE A LOCKS
ON THE HOUSE YOU WEREN'T
FORECLOSING ON.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY EVEN IF
FORECLOSURE WAS LEGIT YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T LOCK SOMEONE OUT OF
THEIR HOUSE WHILE THEY ARE IN IT
UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE
THE LOCKS AND TURN THE HOUSE
INSIDE OUT.
[LAUGHTER]
WAS THAT THE IDEA?
LOCK HER IN AND THEN --
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW SINCE WE THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE NOW THE OWNER OF OVER
HALF OF THESE CRAPPY MORTGAGES,
WE CAN DEMAND A HALT TO THOSE
FORECLOSURES, TAKE A BREATH
UNTIL THE PAPERWORK IS
STRAIGHTENED OUT, UNTIL ORDER IS
RESTORED TO THE SYSTEM UNLESS
SOME TYPE OF WEIRD CATCH 22 HAS
BEEN IMPLANTED IN THE PAPERWORK
THAT CREATES A SOPHIE'S CHOICE
SITUATION.
>> IF YOU FREEZE FORECLOSURES
THEY CANNOT GET MONEY OUT OF
MORTGAGES THEY HOLD.
RESULT, WE THE TAXPAYER TAKE A
HIT.
>> IT DELAYS THE FORECLOSURE
PROCESS.
IT PHAOEPBSZ HOUSE PRICES WILL
BE WEAKER AND SO WILL THE
ECONOMY FOR LONGER.
>> Jon: HUH.
SO OUR CHOICES ARE?
WE CAN IMPROVE THE ECONOMY BY
THROWING MILLIONS OF FAMILIES
OUT OF THEIR HOUSES JUST IN TIME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
[LAUGHTER]
OR WE CAN LET THEM STAY IN THEIR
HOUSES AND CRASH THE REST OF THE
ECONOMY BECAUSE APPARENTLY NOW
WE HAVE A FORECLOSURE-BASED
ECONOMY.
WE ARE (bleep).
AND THE SAD PART IS RUBE
GOLDBERG HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE
DESIGNED A MORE CONVOLUTED
METHOD TO IN FACT (bleep) US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE A
GREEN CHIHUAHUA'S PENIS.
[LAUGHTER]
MAYBE CONGRESS CAN GET ON THE
CASE AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR
AMERICANS TO CHALLENGE THE
AUTHENTICITY OF TP *RBGZ AND
OTHER DOCUMENTS.
>> THE NEW LEGISLATION MAKING
COURTS ACCEPT DOCUMENTS MADE OUT
OF STATE.
THAT BILL QUIETLY PASSION
THROUGH THE SENATE LAST WEEK
WITHOUT PUBLIC DEBATE.
THAT'S HOW CONGRESS FIXES THE
PROBLEM BY PASSING A BILL THAT
SAYS --
[LAUGHTER]
IS ANYBODY -- IS ANYBODY PAYING
ATTENTION?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL NOT SIGN
INTO LAW AN OVERLOOKED PIECE OF
LEGISLATION THAT CRITICS WOULD
MAKE IT EASIER FOR BANKS AND
OTHERS TO PROCESS FORECLOSURE
PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT SIGNATURES.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
IT'S CRAZY WH
