POKER.
FOR MORE ON THIS APPOINTMENT,
WE GO NOW LIVE TO SENIOR
POLITICAL ANALYST JOHN
OLIVER STAND ON THE HALLOWED
FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
JOHN OLIVER, NICE TO SEE
YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER, WHAT IS
THIS?
>> JON T COULDN'T BE
SIMPLER.
IN 2010 IN THE THROES OF ONE
OF THE WORST ECONOMIC
RECESSIONS IN U.S. HISTORY
CONGRESS CAME TOGETHER AND
PASSED A LAW CREATING A
BADLY NEEDED CONSUMER
PROTECTION BUREAU.
A WATCHDOG AGAINST THE KINDS
OF PREDATORY FINANCIAL
PRACTICES THAT HAVE SO
DESTROYED THE ECONOMIC
FOUNDATION OF THIS GREAT
COUNTRY.
AND SINCE THEN, CONGRESS HAS
WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PREVENT
THIS UNACCOUNTABLE,
UNELECTED AND DOWN RIGHT
DANGEROUS BUREAU FROM EVER
FULLY COMING TO EXISTENCE.
THAT'S THE ANSWER, JON, YOU
ARE WELCOME.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CAN I
GET OUT OF HERE.
>> Jon: YES, NO, YES, I HAVE
QUESTION.
IF CONGRESS NOW FEARS THE
BUREAU THAT THEY THEMSELVES
CREATED, WHY NOT THEN JUST
PASS A LAW UNCREATING IT?
>> WELL, WHAT?
GO ON RECORD AS OPPOSING A
VITAL AND NECESSARY AGENCY
THAT WILL PROTECT THE MOST
VULNERABLE, HARDWORKING
FAMILIES IN THIS I:.
OH, YEAH THAT WILL PLAY
GREAT IN AN ELECTION YEAR.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: BUT YOU JUST SAID
THEY'RE KILLING IT
BUREAUCRATLY.
>> EXACTLY BUT WHY SHOOT
SOMETHING IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU
CAN JUST QUIETLY SQUEEZE ITS
FEEDING TUBE IN THE PRIV SEE
OF A HOSPITAL SHIFT CHANGE.
>> Jon: SO THE CONGRESS
WON'T GET RID OF THE AGENCY
LEGISLATIVELY.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Jon: THEY'LL JUST STAY IN
A SORT OF SUSPENDED
ANIMATION PERPETUAL FAKE
SESSION TO PREVENT THE
PRESIDENT FROM A RECESS
APPOINTMENT.
BUT IF THEY ARE IN SESSION.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHY CAN'T THE
DEMOCRATS JUST BRING THE
GUY'S NAME UP FOR AN UP OR
DOWN CONFIRMATION VOTE.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A
MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.
>> WHOA, JON, ARE WE REALLY
DOING THIS?
(LAUGHTER)
ARE YOU REALLY STOOPING SO
LOW TO ASK ME A BRITISHER,
TO EXPLAIN YOUR OWN
COUNTRY'S SYSTEM TO YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
IS THAT HAPPENING?
I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS
HAPPENING.
>> Jon: JOHN, NO, WE DON'T
HAVE TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS.
WE ALREADY HAVE GREEN CARDS.
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
POINT TAKEN.
POINT TAKEN.
THE DEMOCRAT, LET ME EXPLAIN
V A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A
SUPERMAJORITY SO THE
REPUBLICANS HAVE VOWED TO
FILIBUSTER ANYBODY THE
PRESIDENT DARE APPOINT.
>> Jon: THOSE BASTARD
REPUBLICANS.
>> QUITE, QUITE.
EXACTLY, JON.
HOW DARE THEY USE THE EXACT
SAME PRO FORMA SESSION
TECHNIQUE THAT HARRY REID
USED IN 2007 TO KEEP GEORGE
W. BUSH FROM APPOINTING
STEPHEN BRADBURY TO HEAD THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE
OF LEGAL COUNSEL.
HOW DARE THEY.
HOW DARE THEY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WAIT, YOU-- CAN I
ASK YOU A QUESTION.
>> WHAT?
>> Jon: YOU HAD TO KNOW ALL
THAT FOR A GREEN CARD.
>> NO, NOT FOR A GREEN CARD,
JON, I'VE GOT THE PLATINUM
CARD.
>> Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW.
>> I WANTED TO CARRY A
CONCEALED WEAPON AND
COMPLAIN ABOUT MEXICANS.
>> Jon: I SEE, ALL RIGHT.
BUT I HAVE T IF THE
DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE
SENATE --
>> I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS
IS GOING.
>> Jon: WHY CAN'T THE
DEMOCRATS MOVE TO ADJOURN TO
ALLOW THE RECESS
APPOINTMENT?
SEE THE REPUBLICANS CAN'T
FILIBUSTER AN ADJOURNMENT.
>> WELL DONE, LITTLE GIRL.
WELL DONE.
WELL DONE.
YOU CAN FINALLY TAKE OFF
THAT TRAINING BRA BECAUSE
YOU HAVE REALLY SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM, HAVEN'T YOU.
QUICK, CALL THE WHITE HOUSE.
I THINK YOU'VE CRACKED IT.
>> Jon: YOU'RE VERY KIND.
>> YOU HAVE EARNED IT.
EXCEPT, JOHN JON, FOR ONE
THING.
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 1,
SECTION 5 OF THE
CONSTITUTION, IF THE HOUSE
CONTROLLED BY THE
REPUBLICANS REFUSES TO PASS
A MATCHING RESOLUTION TO
ADJOURN THEY CAN FORCE THE
SENATE TO STAY OPEN IN THE
SAME PRO FORMA SESSION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I THINK I JUST THREW
UP A LITTLE BIT IN MY MOUTH,
I'M SORRY.
>> AND YET THIS IS WHAT YOU
REJECTED CONSTITUTIONAL
MONARCHY FOR SO WHY DON'T
YOU SUCK IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, OLIVER, THIS
CONGRESS MAKES ME SO ANGRY,
THIS CONGRESS, THIS DO
NOTHING BUNCH OF MOTHER
[BLEEP].
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
JON, YOU TAKE THAT BACK!
THEY DO NOT DO NOTHING.
THEY ARE MOTHER [BLEEP] BUT
DO YOU KNOW, JON, DO YOU
KNOW THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT
TAKES TO PERFORM THIS LEVEL
OF MOTHER WLOOEP BLOOEP --
[BLEEP]ERY.
SURE ARE, YOU AREN'T SEEING
IN ON C-SPAN BUT LOOK BEHIND
THE FLAPS TO THE ACTUAL
OFFICE OF OUR CAPITOL
BUILDING.
THESE GOOD PEOPLE, JON.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD.
>> WHO DEDICATED PUBLIC
SERVANTS WORK TIRELESSLY,
JON, NIGHT AND DAY TO MAKE
SURE THAT NOTHING GETS DONE.
THIS, JON, THEY-- DO NOT
LOOK AWAY, STEWART, YOU NEED
TO SEE THIS LOOK AT IT!
LOOK, DIRECTLY AT IT!
THIS, JON, THIS, THIS RIGHT
HERE, THIS IS HOW THE
SAUSAGE DOESN'T GET MADE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, LOOK T
TAKES ALOT OF EFFORT.
>> YEAH T DOES TAKE A LOT OF
EFFORT, JON.
YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON THIS
FOR 1 SECOND AND WHO KNOWS
WHAT COULD HAPPEN.
A PROGRAM THAT WORKS TO
EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE
EMERGES.
OR A BRIDGE GETS BUILT TO
SOMEWHERE.
AND YOU SAY THAT THESE
PEOPLE DON'T WORK, SHAME ON
YOU, STEWART.
SHAME ON THEM AND SHAME ON
YOU.
>> Jon: BUT WHAT IF WE USED
THAT SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT TO
HELP FIX OR AMELIORATE THE
PROBLEMS OUR COUNTRY FACES.
>> YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD
DO THAT TOO BUT THIS IS THE
DIRECT NO SHOW FROM THE
GO-IN.
SO EITHER WAY, EITHER WAY.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
JOHN, JOHN
