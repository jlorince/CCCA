(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
NOW, WE TURN AGAIN TO IRAQ.
LAST TIME WE CHECKED IT WAS AQUAGMIRE WRAPPED IN A
CATASTROPHE STUCK INSIDE ACLUSTER (BLEEP).
WHERE ARE WE NOW?
>> I.S.I.S. OVERRAN RAMADIEARLIER THIS MONTH WITH A WAVE
OF SUICIDE CAR AND TRUCK BOMBS.
>> Jon: SO, NOW WE'VE DEEP FRIEDIT IN CHAOS OIL.
HOW DID I.S.I.S. TAKE OVER THECA PTIAL OF ANBAR PROVINCE?
>> I.S.I.S. FIGHTERS HIT THECITY WITH 30 CAR BOMBS THAT
WITNESSES SAY TOOK OUT ENTIRECITY BLOCKS.
>> THEY WAITED TILL THERE WERESANDSTORM, WHICH LESSENED THE
EFFECT OF AMERICAN AIR POWER.
THEY USED INNOVATIVE SUICIDEVEHICLES TO DO THE BULLDOZER
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
THESE GUYS ARE THINKING --
>> Jon: BULLDOZERS SNEAKING ININ SANDSTORMS AND HIGH
EXPLOSIVES?
THESE GUYS AREN'T TECTICALGENIUSES.
THEY STOLE THEIR WHOLE BATTLEPLAN FROM MAD MAX: FURY ROAD.
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT GOES.
EXCEPT THE PART ABOUT WOMENBEING ABLE TO DRIVE.
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S JUST SCIENCEFICTION.
WHAT AN INSANE ASSAULT!
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT MUST BELOSING THEIR (BLEEP).
>> IT WAS AN ACTION THATSURPRISED ALL OF US.
THAT AN ARMY WITH THAT MUCHPOWER WOULD DRAW SUCH A SMALL
ENEMY.
THIS IS NOT THE ARMY WE AREWILLING TO SEE OR WERE EXPECTING
TO SEE.
>> Jon: THAT'S HOW THE DEPUTYPRIME MINISTER REGISTERS
SURPRISE.
IT MUST BE A LOT OF FUN TO THROWHIM A PARTY.
(LAUGHTER)
UH, A SURPRISE PARTY...
I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO FIND ALLMY FRIENDS IN THE LIVING ROOM.
(LAUGHTER)
IT IS STRANGE WHEN WE CAMEHOME AND...
AND MY WIFE RANG THE DOORBELL.
I DID WONDER WHY ALL OF MYFRIENDS' CARS WERE PARKED
OUTSIDE.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IRAQI OFFICIALS WERE THROWNFOR A LOOP BY THE WITHDRAWAL
FROM RAMADI OF THEIR OWN ARMY.
AND AMERICAN OFFICIALS ECHOEDTHEIR SURPRISE MORE EXPLICITLY.
>> THE IRAQI FORCES SHOWED NOWILL TO FIGHT.
THEY WERE NOT OUTNUMBERED.
IN FACT, THEY VASTLY OUTNUMBEREDTHE OPPOSING FORCE, AND YET THEY
FAILED TO FIGHT --
>> Jon: YOUR FATHER AND I, WE'RENOT ANGRY AT YOU --
(LAUGHTER)
-- WE'RE JUST VERY DISAPPOINTED.
THIS SEEMS TO BE A HABIT WITHTHE IRAQI ARMY.
WHEN WE INVADED THEY THREW DOWNTHEIR WEAPONS AND RAN AWAY, AND
THEN THEY SPENT THE NEXT TENYEARS MAKING LIFE A LIVING HELL.
HOLLY [BLEEP], THE IRAQI ARMYHAS I.S.I.S. JUST WHERE THEY
WANT THEM.
YOU LET THEM TRULY COUNTRYUNTHEY WILL FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT
SUCKS TO TRY TO CONTROL IRAQ.
IT'S THE PERFECT PLAN.
NOW, TO BE FAIR, IT'S NOT LIKETHE IRAQI SOLDIERS THREW IN THE
TOWEL AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF ABLACK FLAG.
THEY'D ALREADY BEEN HOLDING OFFI.S.I.S. FOR 18 MONTHS WITH NO
REINFORCEMENTS FROM BAGHDAD.
FOR ALL WE KNOW, IT WAS JUST ABATHROOM BREAK, WHICH MAY BE WHY
SECRETARY ASH'S COMMENTS WERENOT TAKEN WELL.
>> IRAQI PRIME MINISTER ABADIRESPONDED TO CARTER'S
REMARKS SAYING HE WAS FLATWRONG.
>> THE COMMENTS FROM ASH CARTERSEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN THE PRIME
MINISTER BY SURPRISE.
>> Jon: WELL, THEY'RE SURPRSIEDTHAT THE ARMY WITHDREW, THEY'RE
SUPRISED BY THE COMMENTS.
JESUS, EVERYTHING IS A SURPRISETO IRAQIS.
LIKE A CAT WALKING PAST AMIRROR.
EVERY TIME THEY WALK PAST, OH MYGOD!
THERE'S A CAT!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
WHO, WHAT'S GOING ON, THERE'SANOTHER CAT!
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT...
AMERICA SAID SOMETHING KIND OFDOPEY AND MEAN ABOUT THE IRAQI
ARMY.
WE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR PUTTINGOUR FOOT IN OUR MOUTH.
FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE A GUY WHODOES LITTLE ELSE.
>> VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HADTO BACK LINEUP OVER THE WEEKEND.
IN A HASTILY ARRANGED PHONE CALLTO THE PRIME MINISTER BIDEN
THANKED HIM FOR THE ENORMOUSSACRIFICE AND BRAVERY OF IRAQI
FORCES AND THE STATE DEPARTMENTRUSHED A SHIPMENT OF 2,000
AT4 ANTI-TANK WEAPONS TOBAGHDAD.
>> Jon: WE'RE SO SORRY, PLEASEACCEPT THIS GIFT FROM SHOOTABLE
ARRANGEMENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S HOW (BLEEP) UP THE MIDDLEEAST IS.
WHATEVER THE QUESTION, THEANSWER IS ALWAYS MORE GUNS.
IF YOU'RE MAD AT SOMEBODY YOUARM A MILITIA.
IF THAT MILITIA IS GETTING TOOMUCH POWER, ARM A RIVAL MILITIA.
IF YOU WANT TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY,TO EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH, EVEN
THAT IS MADE OUT OF (BLEEP)GUNS!
(LAUGHTER)
I JUST HOPE SOONER OR LATERTHERE WILL BE ENOUGH WEAPONS IN
THE MIDDLE EAST FOR PEACE TOBREAK OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
