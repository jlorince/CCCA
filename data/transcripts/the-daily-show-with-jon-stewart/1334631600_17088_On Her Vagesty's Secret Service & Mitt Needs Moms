AND WILL BANANAS SAVE US ALL?
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, FOLKS.
YOU KNOW I'M A SIMPLE MAN.
ALL I NEED TO BE HAPPY IS A DECENT CHEESE BURGER, A TASTY BREW AND A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
FROM ALL MY FAVORITE SPORTS TEAMS AND ON OCCASION WHERE A POWERFUL ORGANIZATION TRIPS ON (BEEP).
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOLLOWING A TRIP TO COLOMBIA, A VISIT THAT WAS

>> Jon: RED EAGLE, THIS IS VICTORY ONE.
YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS A GROUP-ON DEAL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
CURRENTLY NOT PACKING GREEN BACKS.
NOW I HAVE A CODE.
OH-OH.
THIS STORY SHOULD BE DOMINATING CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS, COMEDY SHOWS, NEWS
NETWORKS BUT IT'S NOT DOMINATING.
IT CAN'T BECAUSE LAST WEDNESDAY SOME LADY SAID A STUPID THING.
>> WHAT YOU HAVE IS MITT ROMNEY RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY SAYING, WELL, YOU KNOW,

YOU KNOW WHAT?

MEET THE PRESS.
FACE THE NATION.
IT WAS EVERYWHERE.

SPACE NEUROSURGEON.
FOR ACCEPTS, NURSE.
THERE THEY GO.
HIS BRAIN IS GOING.
OH, GRAVITY.
( APPLAUSE ) SPACE NEUROSURGEON IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST JOB.
THE EASIEST JOB WAS FILLING UP FOX'S PROGRAMMING AFTER ROSEN'S COMMENTS.
THERE WASN'T A SHOW, THERE WASN'T A SATELLITE INTERVIEW,

THE NEW POSTER CHILD FOR ELITE HOMEMAKER SNOB.

>> Jon: TO BE FAIR, IT IS ALSO SPRING.
QUICK SIDE NOTE PLAN'S PIN IS A BAROMETER THAT TELLS YOU WHAT SIDE OF THE CULTURE WARS
YOU'RE ON.
PATRIOTIC REAL AMERICANS REAL IT LIKE THIS.
BUT IF YOU'RE FROM NEW JERSEY AND AN EAST COAST LIBERAL ELITE YOU THINK IT'S A TONGUE
IN CHEEK HOMAGE TO THE SOPRANOS.
>> SHE WAS A WHO-A.
