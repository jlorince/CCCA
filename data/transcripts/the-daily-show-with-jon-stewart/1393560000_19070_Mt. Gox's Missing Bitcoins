REVEALED THAT HUNDREDS OFMILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF
BITCOINS WERE MISSING.

MAGIC THE GATHERING ON-LINEEXCHANGE IT STARTED AS A
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO TRADEMAGIC CARDS.
(LAUGHTER)WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
A PLACE TO TRADE MAGIC CARDS,SO DID MY BASEMENT.
DOES THAT MEAN MY BASEMENT ISNOW A CURRENCY
EXCHANGE?
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
IT'S NOT LIKE MONEY THATDOESN'T REALLY EXIST CAN
JUST DISAPPEAR, RIGHT.
>> DO YOU THINK THERE'S BEENFRAUD HERE?
>> I THINK THERE IS A PRETTYSTRONG LIKELIHOOD OF THAT I
THINK A LOT OF US SUSPECTEDTHAT FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOTTALKING VERY OPENLY ABOUT
WHAT IS GOING ON, THEY DLEETEDALL THEIR TWEETS FROM THEIR
TWITTER ACCOUNT.
>> Jon: THEY DELETED THETWEETS, THAT WILL SOLVE IT I
THINK ANTHONY WEINER TRIEDTHAT ROUTE AS WELL.
GOOD LUCK WITH THATSTRATEGY.
