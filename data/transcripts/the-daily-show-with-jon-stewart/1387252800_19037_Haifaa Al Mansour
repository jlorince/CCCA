[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S THE FIRSTFEMALE FILMMAKER IN SAUDI
ARABIA.

HER MOVIE WHICH SHE WROTE ANDDIRECTED IS CALLED WADJDA.
HER MOVIE WHICH SHE WROTE ANDDIRECTED IS CALLED WADJDA.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOMEHAIFAA AL MANSOUR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HOW ARE YOU?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> WOW.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL I SEE YOUARE WEARING THE TRADITIONAL
SAUDI BLACK LEATHER FONZIEJACKET.
I BOUGHT IT TO YOU FOR, JON.
>> Jon: IT'S LOVELY.
WHAT A LOVELY WONDERFUL FILM.
>> AH.
>> Jon: CAN YOU EXPLAIN JUSTBRIEFLY THE PLOT FOR EVERYBODY?
>> YEAH, IT TOOK A WHILE TO GETIT OFF THE GROUND, FIVE YEARS OF
WORK.
IT'S A JOURNEY OF A LITTLEGIRL IN SAUDI.
SHE'S FEISTY, HAS A GREAT SENSEOF HUMOR.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE WOMAN THATWE SAW?
>> WADJDA, YEAH.
SHE WANTS A BICYCLE.
YOU KNOW SAUDI ARABIA ALLCONSERVATIVE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT WOMEN CANNOT DOAND EVERYTHING. BUT
SHE MANAGES TO GET IT AND IT'SABOUT ACHIEVING DREAMS AND
WORKING HARD.
IT CONCENTRATES MORE ABOUT HUMANDIGNITY AND RESISTANCE AND
RESILIANCE.
>> Jon: BUT THIS IS WHAT I SOAPPRECIATE ABOUT IT.
THE THEME IS SO UNIVERSAL ANDSIMPLE THAT YOU FORGET.
AND THEN THE CONTEXT OF WHERE ITIS JUST BECOMES PART OF THE
BACKDROP, AND IT REALLY HELPS TOHUMANIZE ALL THE DIFFERENT
CHARACTERS AND INFORM IN A WAYTHAT I THINK IT WOULDN'T
OTHERWISE.
>> I TRIED NOT TO JUSTLIKE COMPLAIN
ABOUT REALITY AND MAKE ITINSPIRING.
PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA WOMEN INGENERAL NEED TO HAVE REFERENCE
OF PEOPLE WORKING REALLY HARD TOCHANGE THEIR DESTINY.
IT'S HARD JUST TO SHOW WOMEN ASVICTIMS.
WE NEED TOSHOW THEM AS WOMEN WHO ARE
PROACTIVE TRYING TO MAKE THEIRLIFE BETTER.
IT'S GOOD FOR ESPECIALLY YOUNGERGENERATIONS TO SEE THAT.
>> Jon: THIS LITTLE GIRL, WHOBY THE WAY, WHAT A FIRECRACKER,
WHERE DID YOU FIND THE YOUNGACTRESS BECAUSE SHE'S TERRIFIC
IN THIS?
IT'S HARD TO FIND ACTRESSESIN SAUDI ESPECIALLY YOUNG
ONES NOT IN THE BUSINESS.
IT WAS THE FIRST FILM EVERFILMED COMPLETELY IN SAUDI.
>> Jon: THERE'S NO MOVIESTUDIOS NO IMAX NONE OF THAT.
>> NOTHING.
>> Jon: SYNAGOGUES, NOTHING.
>> THAT IS FOR SURE.
[LAUGHTER]WE DIDN'T WANT TO ATTRACT
ATTENTION.
WORK LOW PROFILE.
WE CAN'T PUT CASTING CALLS FORGIRLS.
WE HAD TO RELY ON THE WORD OFMOUTH AND SMALL PRODUCTION
COMPANIES THAT INCLUDES KIDS FORHOLIDAYS AND ALL THAT.
YEAH, WE MET A LOT OF AMAZINGGIRLS, REALLY BEAUTIFUL HAVE
CHARISMA BUT THEY GO HOME ANDHAVE SECOND THOUGHTS AND THEY
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
THE HEART IS BREAKING BECAUSETHEY ARE AFRAID OF SOCIETY AND
WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK OF THEM.
THEN I WROTE THE STORY ON MYNIECE.
I HAVE A NIECE LIKE THIS ALWAYSSCHEMING TO EARN SOME MONEY.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE SPIRITOF MY NIECE.
SHE DIDN'T CARE SHE DIDN'T DOHER HAIR OR ANYTHING.
I LIKED THAT.
>> Jon: IT WAS VERYINTERESTING.
AS I WATCHED IT, I THOUGHT IT'SSO DETAILED IT SMACKED OF
PERSONAL -- IT'S THE GREEN BIKE.
THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A GREENBIKE IN YOUR PAST.
>> OH, YEAH.
>> Jon: BECAUSE IT'S TOO --THERE WAS SOMETHING SO ORGANIC
AND NATURAL.
>> I HAD A GREEN BICYCLE. I'MFROM A BIG FAMILY, ONE OF 12
KIDS, ONE IN BETWEEN TWO BOYS.
MY FATHER TOOK MY BROTHERS TOBUY A BICYCLE. I SAW A GREEN
ONE.
HE WANTED TO BUY IT FOR ME BUTTHE GUY SELLING WASN'T HAPPY WAS
THINKING MY FATHER DID THE WRONGDECISION.
>> Jon: DIDN'T WANT TO SELL TOA GIRL?
>> YEAH, HE SOLD IT BUT HE MADEHIS OBJECTION CLEAR.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS SOINTERESTING TO WATCH THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THE GIRLAND HER MOTHER INTERACTED IN
PUBLIC AND INTERACTED INPRIVATE.
IN PRIVATE IT'S SORT OF THEWHOLE WORLD OPENS UP TO THEM AND
THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFULRELATIONSHIP BUT IN PUBLIC IT
FEELS LIKE THERE'S A SENSE OFFEAR OR --
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: OR ANXIETY.
>> SAUDI IS ALL ABOUT WHAT ISPRIVATE AND WHAT IS PUBLIC.
PUBLIC PEOPLE HAVE TO -- EVENMEN HAVE TO WEAR ALL THE GEAR
AND ALL THAT AND KEEP A CERTAINPERSONA.
AT HOME THERE'S FLIRTING, LOVEFOR FOOD, DANCING.
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE NORMALFAMILY LIFE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SEE THATABOUT SAUDI.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAYABOUT THE SOCIETY.
TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THECULTURE.
WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE ECONOMY ANDPOLITICS BUT IT'S NICE TO KNOW
HOW PEOPLE ARE.
>> Jon: HAS THE GOVERNMENTCONTACTED YOU?
>> OH, YES.
>> Jon: ARE THEY NERVOUS ABOUTTHIS?
UPSET ABOUT THIS?
YOU FILMED IN SAUDI.
WOMEN ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALKTO UNRELATED RELATIVES WHO ARE
MEN.
HOW DID YOU EVEN FILM?
>> OH, YEAH IN PUBLIC I WAS IN AVAN.
>> Jon: YOU WERE IN A VAN?
>> YES AND I HAD A WALKIE TALKIEAND HAD A MONITOR.
>> Jon: YOU COULDN'T GO ON THESTREET SO YOU WOULD SIT IN THE
VAN AND TALK TO THE ACTORS.
>> IT'S A VERY COMPLIANT PLACE.
>> Jon: WHAT DO THEY THINK OFWHAT YOU'VE DONE?
>> THEY NOMINATED THE FILM SAUDIARABIA TO THE OSCARS.
>> Jon: THEY LOVE IT.
THAT'S VERY NICE.
IT'S EXCITING.
>> IT IS EXCITING.
I THINK THAT IT'S OPENING UP TOWOMAN AND ARTS.
IT'S VERY CONSERVATIVE ANDPEOPLE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WHAT TO SAY OR NOT TO SAY BUTTHERE'S A SMALL SPACE AND I
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TOCAPITALIZE ON THAT SPACE.
LEARN FROM IRANIAN FILMMAKERSTHEY DO FILMS FROM WHERE THEY
COME FROM AND ACCEPTED BACKHOME AND I THINK IT'S EFFECTIVE
IN CHANGING PEOPLE THERE AND ITHINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO
HAVE THIS CHANGE THAT TAKESROOTS DEEP IN LIKE BELIEF AND
TRADITION.
>> Jon: I THINK WHAT IS SOOPTIMISTIC BECAUSE YOU CAN READ
IT TWO WAYS BUT WHAT LEAVES WITHYOU AN OPTIMISTIC FEELING IS
THERE'S A CERTAIN AIR OFINEVITABILITY ABOUT THIS CHANGE.
THIS IS OUT OF GOVERNMENTCONTROL THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO STOP.
>> I THINK THE WORLD ISDIFFERENT NOW ALL THE
INFORMATION AND SAUDIS ARE RICH.
ALL THE KIDS HAVE AN iPAD, ACCESS TO INTERNET.
YOU CANNOT STOP THAT.
>> Jon: CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A MARVELOUS FILM.
WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU ONTHE SHOW.
GOOD LUCK WITH THE OSCARS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Jon: WADJDA IT'S IN THEATERSNOW. HAIFAA AL MONSOUR.
