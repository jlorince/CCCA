>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE BEST
SELLING AUTHOR, AND WHEN I SAY
BEST I MEAN BEST -- HIS NEW BOOK
IS CALLED "SQUIRREL SEEKS
CHIPMUNK."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM DAVID SEDARIS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THAT WAS GREAT TO SEE IRA IN
A CAT SUIT.
>> Jon: IRA GLASS, YOU, I
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A SHOWER A
PLEDGE DRIVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING
TODAY.
"SQUIRREL SEEKS CHIPMUNK."
I'M ANGRY WITH YOU AT YOUR
ABILITY TO WRITE HILARIOUS BOOKS
QUICKLY.
HOW DO YOU -- THIS IS SUCH AN
INTERESTING IDEA.
WHERE IS THE IDEA FOR THIS BOOK
COME FROM?
>> SOMEBODY GAVE ME AN AUDIO
BOOK OF THESE FOLK TALES, SOUTH
AFRICAN FOLK TALES.
I STARTED LISTENING TO IT AND I
THOUGHT, CAN I DO BETTER THAN
THIS.
THEY JUST WEREN'T VERY GOOD.
IT WAS LIKE --
[LAUGHTER]
IT JUST WASN'T VERY GOOD.
I JUST STARTED --
>> Jon: DRIVING ALONG THINKING
I CAN DO BETTER THAN EASE SOUTH
AFRICA ORAL TRADITIONS.
I COULD WRITE THESE BETTER.
THESE ARE -- THE ANIMAL SORT OF
FABLES.
I MEAN CANINE INFIDELITY.
ALL SORTS OF VERY HUMAN PECK
DILLIES.
-- IT PACKS MORE PUNCH SOMEHOW.
>> IF YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
PHILIP AND LESLIE DATED FOR TWO
WEEKS AND THEY RAN OUT OF THINGS
TO TALK ABOUT.
AS A READER I WOULD NEED TO KNOW
WHAT LESLIE'S HAIR COLOR WAS AND
WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE.
BUT THE SQUIRREL AND THE
CHIPMUNK, YOU CAN JUST START.
AS A READER AND LISTENER YOU
WOULD THINK FIVE PAGES.
I WOULD PERVERSE FOR THAT TO GO
ON FOR 17, 18 PAGES.
I LIKE THAT AS WELL.
[LAUGHTER]
THE BELIEVEITY.
>> Jon: IT IS BELIEVEITY --
BREVITY.
IN THE BEGINNING DID YOU THINK
IT WAS MOST NUT BASED
CONVERSATION AND THEN --
>> IT ACTUALLY WAS.
>> Jon: I WOULD THINK.
>> AND HOW MUCH THEY DISLIKED
DOGS.
>> Jon: REALLY?
AND THEN THEY BOND AND THAT'S
IT.
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF DOING A
BOOK THAT DOES THIS LITERATURE
THAT WE HAVE TODAY.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ROMEO AND
JULIETTE DONE IN A SQUIRREL
CHIPMUNK TYPE -- I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE IT IN A DINNER THEATER.
NO GOOD?
>> DINNER THEATER.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: CAN YOU NOW -- ARE
YOU -- CAN YOU LOOK AT ANIMALS
IN THE SAME WAY OR ARE YOU -- IN
YOUR HEAD THINKING OF WHAT THEY
MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT NOW.
HAS IT CHANGED THE WAY YOU
INTERACT WITH THE ANIMAL WORLD?
>> I'M A NATURE PERSON NOT
REALLY A PET PERSON.
I'M INTERESTED.
I LIKE READING ABOUT NATURE.
I LIKE READING ABOUT, YOU KNOW
HORRIBLE MEAN ANIMALS OR EVEN
FRIENDLY ONES.
I DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO OWN
THEM.
BUT THAT WAS AN INTERESTING
THING.
WORKING ON THE BOOK I WROTE A
STORY ABOUT GROUNDHOGS.
MY EDITOR WHO IS FANTASTIC IS
SAID IT'S OKAY.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS
ABOUT GROUND HOGS.
WE EXPECT A CAT TO BE VAIN OR A
MONKEY TO CAUSE TROUBLE BUT WE
DON'T HAVE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
OF GROUND HOGS.
MAYBE WE COULD LOVE THIS OUT.
IT IS A GOOD NOTE.
IT WAS SOMETHING I HADN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT.
SHE'S A GOOD -- SHE'S ALSO THE
ONE WHO CAME UP WITH THE TITLE
OF THE BOOK.
I WANTED TO CALL IT LET'S
EXPLORE DIABETES WITH OWLS.
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK THAT IS -- I WAS SO
PROUD OF MYSELF WHEN I CAME UP
WITH THAT TITLE.
>> Jon: I LOVE IT.
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
>> SHE SAID PLEASE DON'T PUT THE
WORD DIABETES IN YOUR BOOK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK IN ANYWAY
SHE WAS CAVING TO PRESSURE FROM
THE GROUNDHOG COMMUNITY BUT NOT
INCLUDING GROUNDHOGS?
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN THE STANDARD
BARRIER FOR SETTING AN
EXPECTATION.
>> I WANTED TO RIGHT 25 STORIES
AND CUT TEN OF THEM.
THAT'S WHAT I ENDED UP DOING.
>> Jon: DO YOU APPROACH IT IN
A MATH MAT CALL WAY?
I BET I COULD SQUEEZE TO 200
PAGES AND DO 15 STORIES BUT I'LL
WRITE 25 BECAUSE THAT'S MY
RATIO?
DO YOU OVERBOOK YOUR OWN NOVELS
OR --?
>> I TRY TO.
I STARTED THIS SEVEN YEARS AGO.
I JUST THOUGHT I'LL WRITE FOR A
YEAR AND THEN EVENTUALLY I'LL
HAVE ENOUGH FOR A BOOK.
I DIDN'T SIT DOWN AND THINK FOR
THE NEXT GO YEARS I'M GOING TO
WRITE -- YOU COULD GO CRAZY.
I WROTE A COUPLE EVERY YEAR AND
READ THEM OUT LOUD AND THROUGH A
LOT AWAY AND REWROTE THEM.
HEARD, YOU KNOW, NOW I HAVE
IDEAS FOR REALLY GOOD ONES.
>> Jon: ARE YOU LIKE
SPINNING -- ARE YOU A PLATE
SPINNER?
DO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT BOOKS YOU
ARE WORK ON SIMULTANEOUSLY?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU MOVE FROM ONE TO
ONE TO ONE?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: CAN I ONLY ACCOMPLISH
ONE THING AT A TIME AND THEN I
HAVE TO GO.
I DID NOT TIE MY SHOES TODAY.
[LAUGHTER]
TOO BUSY THINKING OF OTHER
THINGS.
CAN YOU GIVE US A HINT OF
SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS COMING
OUT?
A SAID SAID -- SEDARIS TEASER,
IF YOU WILL.
>> I WRITE ESSIVES.
>> Jon: DO YOU WRITE THINGS
AND SAY I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WENT
TO PRINT?
>> I'VE BEEN ON THIS TOUR FOR
THE LAST MONTH.
I LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE PROJECT
ON TOUR, JUST A LITTLE THEME.
SO I'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE TO
TELL ME JOKES.
SOMEONE TOLD ME A JOKE LAST
WEEK.
I WISH THAT -- I GUESS I WISH I
MED -- MADE IT UP.
A MAN IS IN HIS HOUSE.
IT'S LATE AT NIGHT.
THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
IT'S A SNAIL.
THE SNAIL SAYS, I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT BUYING MAGAZINE
SUBSCRIPTIONS.
THE MAN IS FURIOUS HE'S BEEN
INTERRUPTED.
HE REARS BACK, KICKS THE IS
SNAIL AS HARD AS HE CAN.
SLAMS THE DOOR GOES TO BED.
WITH IT YEARS LATER HE IS
GETTING READY FOR -- TWO YEARS
LATER HE'S GETTING READY FOR BED
AND THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
HE ANSWERS IT.
IT'S THE SNAIL.
THE SNAIL GOES WHAT THE
(bleep) WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SQUIRREL SEEKS
CHIPMUNK.
YOU MUST.
