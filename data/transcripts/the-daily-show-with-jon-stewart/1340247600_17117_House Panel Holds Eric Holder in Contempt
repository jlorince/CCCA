( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VISIT FROM OUR GOOD FRIEND AND NOTED AUTHOR STEVE CARELL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FIRST, BREAKING NEWS.
IT IS SO (BLEEP)ING HOT TODAY.
(LAUGHTER) I DON'T HAVE A FOLLOWUP TO THAT.
(LAUGHTER) BREAKING NEWS CONCERNING THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE
ADMINISTRATION'S FAST AND FURIOUS PROGRAM WHICH FROM 2009 TO 2011 SOLD AMERICAN GUNS TO
MEXICAN DRUG LORDS SO THAT THE DRUG LORDS... COULD... SHOOT...
PEOPLE?
OR PERHAPS ACCIDENTALLY THEMSELVES?
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ON A HIGH AFTER CASH FOR CLUNKERS AND THIS PROGRAM MIGHT HAVE JUST GOTTEN
AWAY FROM THEM, I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER) THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE DEBACLE BUT ATTORNEY GENERAL
ERIC HOLDER HAS REFUSED TO TURN OVER SOME 80,000 DOCUMENTS THAT CHAIRMAN DARRELL ISSA HAS
DEMANDED SITING AS GROUNDS THAT THEY NEED THE PAPERS TO GIFT WRAP OTHER WEAPONS FOR AN
EXCITING NEW PRISON PROGRAM CHRISTMAS GUNS FOR CONVICTS.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF BULL (BLEEP) PARTISAN TYPE
INVESTIGATIONS THAT GO ON ON CAPITOL HILL, MANY OF THEM DESIGNED TO MERELY TIE UP OR
DAMAGE THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT HERE'S THE THING: THE A.T.F. DID
SEND A BUNCH OF GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG GANGS.
ONE OF THOSE GUNS WAS USED TO KILL A U.S. BORDER AGENT.
SO YOU KNOW IF HOLDER DIDN'T TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS THIS WAS COMING.
>> THE COMMITTEE MEETS TODAY TO CONSIDER REPORTING A RESOLUTION
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FINDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER, JR., IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
>> Jon: OW.
THAT'S GOT TO STING.
CONGRESS HOLDING SOMETHING ELSE IN CONTEMPT.
(LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GIVE A DOG A BANANA AND THEY GO "I DON'T EAT
THAT." AND YOU'RE LIKE "YOU LICK YOUR BALLS BUT A BANANA IS BENEATH YOU?"
(LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY, WHY WON'T DOGS EAT BANANAS?
IS THAT JUST MY DOG?
IT WON'T EAT BANANAS.
DO YOUR DOGS EAT BANANAS?
YEAH, DOGS HATE (BLEEP)ING BANANAS.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
(LAUGHTER) BACK TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE PROGRAM WHERE THEY SOLD GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG LORDS.
I GUESS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TURN THOSE DOCUMENTS OVER.
UNLESS...
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ENTERED THE FRAY AND ASSERTED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER THE DOCUMENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY CONGRESSMAN ISSA.
>> PRESIDENT BUSH ASSERTED SIX EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGES.
PRESIDENT CLINTON EXERTED 14.
AND THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
>> Jon: OH, THE FIRST INVOKING OF THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
A HALLOWED RITE OF PASSAGE.
LIKE A PRESIDENCY'S BAR MITZVAH.
(LAUGHTER) MAZEL TOV, MR. PRESIDENT.
