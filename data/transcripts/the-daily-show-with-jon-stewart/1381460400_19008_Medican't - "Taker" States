NOW YOU ARE PROBABLYTHINKING, JON, THIS IS SO
ABSTRACT WITH THESE NUMBERS.
CAN YOU SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RETALKING ABOUT?
MAYBE WITH AN EXAMPLE FROMTHE SHOW ME STATE, MISSOURI.
>> 45-YEAR-OLD BERTHAMcINTYRE NEEDS DAILY
MEDICATION.
SHE DOES NOT QUALIFY FORMEDICAID IN MISSOURI BECAUSE
HER FAMILY INCOME IS TOOHIGH, ABOUT $1200 A MONTH.
>> WELL AIN'T SHE FANCY!
WHAT, WITH HER CLOTHES ANDSHELTER.
SEE THAT WOMAN IS CONSIDEREDTOO RICH FOR MEDICAID, BUT
TOO POOR FOR THE OBAMACARESUBSIDIES TO HAVE AN
EFFECT.
YES, THAT'S HOW MUCH SENSETHIS ALL MAKES.
SO WHY NOT EXPAND MEDICAID,MISSOURI.
>> REPUBLICAN STATE SENATORJOHN LAMPING ARGUES MISSOURI
FACES TOUGH CHOICES.
>> THE ENTIRE COST OFMEDICAID IN MISSOURI IS
ONE-THIRD OF MISSOURI'SBUDGET.
WE CAN BARELY AFFORD TO BEIN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AS
IT EXISTS TODAY.
>> Jon: BOY, THIS IS A TOUGHCHOICE.
SHOULD WE AS A STATE ACCEPT100% OF THIS PROGRAM'S
EXPANSION COSTS FROM THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST
THREE YEARS OR I DON'TKNOW-- [BLEEP] IT?
BUT IT IS A TOUGH CHOICE.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOUGHCHOICES YOUR CITIZENS ARE
MAKING?
>> AM I GOING TO TAKE FOODOUT OF A CHILD'S STOMACH OR
AM I GOING DO WITHOUT GOING TOTHE DOCTOR, WHICH WOULD YOU
CHOOSE?
>> HERE'S THE BEST PART.
THESE GOVERNORS ANDLEGISLATURES WHO REFUSE TO
ACCEPT FEDERAL DOLLARS TOEXPAND MEDICAID FOR PEOPLE
LIKE THAT NICE LADY, ALL BUTTHREE OF THOSE 26 STATES
THEY REPRESENT ALREADY TAKEMORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT THAN THEYCONTRIBUTE IN TAX DOLLARS.
THEY ARE ALREADY BURDENS ONTHE SYSTEM.
I BELIEVE THEY'RE REFERREDTO BY THOSE REPUBLICANS AS
MOOCHERS.
MOOCHER STATES.
AND IF STATEHOOD WAS HEALTHCARE, MISSISSIPPI AND
MISSOURI WOULD BE REJECTEDAS HAVING THAT AS A
PREEXISTING CONDITION.
SO YOU MAY BE THINKING TOYOURSELF, SO WHAT DO THESE
UNINSURED PEOPLE DO FORHEALTH CARE.
WELL, REPUBLICANS ACTUALLYHAD THAT COVERED IN THE LAST
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKEDOUT.
>> WELL, WE DO PROVIDE CAREFOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T
HAVE INSURANCE.
PEOPLE, IF SOMEONE HAS AHEART ATTACK, THEY DON'T SIT
IN THEIR APARTMENT AND DIE.
WE PICK THEM UP IN AAMBULANCE AND TAKE THEM TO
THE HOSPITAL AND GIVE THEMCARE.
>> Jon: HISTORICAL FOOTNOTEIS RIGHT.
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO THEEMERGENCY ROOM.
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO THEEMERGENCY ROOM WHEN YOU'RE
HAVING A HEART ATTACKAND APPARENTLY THEY THINK
THAT'S THE FISCALLYRESPONSIBLE OPTION RATHER
THAN EXPANDSING MEDICAID,BECAUSE UNLIKE OBAMACARE, WE
ALL KNOW ER VISITS ARE FREE!
JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.
>> WHEN THE UNINSURED END UPHERE IN THE ER, THEIR COSTS
ARE PASSED ON TO PAYINGCUSTOMERS.
THAT MEANS INSURANCECOMPANIES END UP PAYING MORE
SO THEY RAISE RATES.
AND FEWER PEOPLE CAN AFFORDHEALTH INSURANCE.
>> THE IMPACT TO OURHOSPITAL DISTRICT IS $52
MILLION A YEAR.
HAD WE EXPANDED MEDICAID, WEWOULD HAVE GOT THAT 52
MILLION FROM THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT INSTEAD WE'RE
GETTING FROM LOCAL TAXPAYERS.
>> Jon: GOT IT?
MEDICAL CARE FOR THEUNINSURED HAS ALREADY
BALLOONED THE COST OF THESYSTEM.
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GAINCONTROL OF THOSE COSTS.
SO IF YOU HAVE A BETTERANSWER, REPUBLICANS, LET'S
[BLEEP] HEAR IT!
BUT DON'T MAKE YOUR PLAN,WHAT DO WE NEED FOOD STAMPS
FOR WHEN WE ALREADY HAVEDINE AND DASH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
