>> Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MYNAME IS JON STEWART.
GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST SIR PAULMCCARTNEY IS GOING TO BE JOINING
US TO TALK A LITTLE LATER ON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]BUT FIRST, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WE ALL KNOW THEESTEEMED MEMBERS OF OUR UNITED
STATES CONGRESS [BEEP]HATE EACH OTHER.
[LAUGHING]IN FACT THE ONLY THING LOWER
THAN CONGRESS' APPROVALRATING AMONGST THE PUBLIC IS HOW
THEY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER.THERE'S A LOT OF SWIPING LEFT.
BUT NOW AS THE NEW YEAR FASTAPPROACHES
THEY MUST ENACT A VARIETY OFLAST MINUTE ITEMS, NOT THE LEAST
OF WHICH IS THE ONE TRILLIONDOLLAR BUDGET THAT ALLOWS THEM
TO KEEP BASTING INTHEIR OWN HATEFUL JUICES.
THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER.
>> WE HAVE SOME IMPORTANT STUFFTO DO.
WE COULD COMPLETE EVERYTHING IFWE WANTED TO TODAY.
I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME, MR.PRESIDENT, IN SUCH A LONG TIME.
AND I WANT TO GO HOME. IBOUGHT A NEW HOME THERE.
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLETO SEE THE HOME.
I HAVE NOT SLEPT IN IT.
WE BOUGHT IT IN MAY.
I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HOME IN
SUCH A LONG TIME.
YOU JUST HAD A BREAK OVERTHANKSGIVING, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
YOU'RE NOT WASHINGTON ADDRESSINGTHE TROOPS BEFORE HEADING
BACK TO MOUNT VERNON.
OH, MR. PRESIDENT, I MISS MYHOME.
[LAUGHING] IT'S A GOOD HOME.
IT'S SPLIT LEVEL, COLONIAL.
IF IT PLEASES THE SENATE ISHOULD WOULD LIKE TO OPEN A
FRONT DOOR AND ENTER HER.
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING HER BACKDOOR, IT'S FINE.
I DON'T CARE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME IN SOMETIME.
SO, DID THE POET LAUREATE OFNEVADA REAL ESTATE GET GOOD NEWS
OR BAD NEWS?
>> CONGRESSIONALNEGOTIATORS HAVE REACHED A DEAL
TO AVERT A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.
>> A 1.1 TRILLION DOLLARSPENDING BILL FUNDING
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGHNEXT SEPTEMBER.
>> A BILL THAT WILL KEEP THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S
LIGHTS ON.
>> WHAT WE'RE TALKING  ABOUTHERE IS A MONUMENTAL
ACHIEVEMENT.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO IT'S NOT.
HARRY REID HAS BEEN HOME JUST ALITTLE WHILE AGO, AND THIS IS
NOT -- I KNOW THAT EXPECTATIONSFOR CONGRESS ARE LOW.
BUT THE ONLY WAY KEEPING THELIGHTS ON IS A MONUMENTAL
ACHIEVEMENT IS IF YOU'RE AMACCABEE AND YOUR MENORAH
HAS BUT ONE NIGHT OF OIL -- TOEVERYONE'S ASTONISHMENT THE
GOVERNMENT LIGHTS BURNEDFOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR.
AND THAT IS WHY WE CELEBRATE THEMIRACLE OF
CONGRESSICA BUDGETICA. WE GOT ABUDGET.
WHAT ARE WE GOING INTO DEBT FORTHIS YEAR?
>> ON IMMIGRATION, THE BILLINCLUDES AT LEAST $1.2 BILLION.
$521 BILLION FOR THE MILITARY.
>> $5.4 BILLION TO COMBAT EBOLA.
>> IT ALSO BLOCKS A PAYRAISE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT.
SORRY JOE BIDEN.
>> Jon: SORRY, JOE BIDEN.
MY GUESS IS HE HEARS THAT PHRASEA LOT.
SIR, WE CAN NOT SERVE YOUWITHOUT A SHIRT,
SORRY JOE BIDEN.
THIS METER DOES NOT ACCEPTCHUCKIE CHEESE TOKENS.
SORRY, JOE BIDEN.
ANYWAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE PRETTYSTANDARD BUDGET STUFF IN THERE.
>> BUDGET CUTS FOR THE IRS ANDTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AGENCY.
>> THIS WOULD DO AWAY WITH THEBAN ON TRADITIONAL
INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS.
>> STOPPING THE DISTRICT OFCOLUMBIA FROM LEGALIZING
MARIJUANA.
>> Jon: WAIT, STOPPING PEOPLEFROM SMOKING POT'S A BUDGET
THING? I THOUGHT THATWAS MORE OF A GIRLFRIEND
OR BOYFRIEND THING. THOSE LASTTHINGS SOUNDED LESS LIKE
BUDGET ITEMS AND MORE LIKE, IDONT KNOW, LAWS.
WHAT OTHER NON BUDGETARY ITEMSARE IN THE BUDGET?
>> FARMERS WILL NOT HAVE TOOBTAIN METHANE EMISSION PERMITS.
>> TWO KINDS OF BIRDS CAN NOLONGER BE DECLARED ENDANGERED.
>> LONGER HOURS FOR TRUCKERS.
>> A FEDERAL PROGRAM CANNOW CALL WHITE POTATOES A
FRESH VEGETABLE.
>> Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP) ISTHAT?
IN THE BUDGET NOW YOU CAN JUSTMAKE UP WORDS?
THE ARMY CAN NOW CALL BULLETSINGESTIBLE IRON SUPPLEMENTS.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH-- HOW DID THAT RANDOM STUFF
END UP IN THE BUDGET?
>> A LOT OF LAW MAKERS USE THISOPPORTUNITY A MUST PASS
BILL TO SLIP IN A LOT OF SPECIALINTEREST PROVISIONS THAT THEY
PROBABLY COULDN'T GETPASSED ON THEIR OWN.
AND SOME OF THEM CAME IN, IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN NOT A
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING.
>> Jon: WHAT?
THEY JUST WAIT UNTIL NOBODY ISLOOKING AND THEN JUST SLIP THIS
TOXIC STUFF IN?
WHAT ARE THEY, THE BILL COSBY OFLEGISLATION?
[LAUGHING][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GUILTY, INNOCENT.
GUILTY, INNOCENT.
GUILTY --[LAUGHING]
ALTHOUGH I IMAGINE YOUCALL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
>> IT'S CALLED A CHRISTMAS TREE.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: AND IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE MAGICAL THAN A LOOK ON ACONGRESS PERSON'S FACE WHEN THEY
COME RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS TOSEE WHAT THEY GOT THEMSELVES?
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER WAY THISBUDGET IS LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE:
LIBERALS WANT TO DESTROY IT.
>> THE BIGGEST ITEM THAT RILEDUP PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS WAS THE
BILL'S REVERSING OF NEWREGULATIONS ON BIG BANKS AND
DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, THEKIND THAT NEARLY IMPLODED
THE WORLD'S FINANCIALSYSTEM IN 2008.
>> THAT PART OF THE LEGISLATIONWAS WRITTEN BY CITIGROUP.
>> Jon: WOW. WELL, OF COURSETHEY HAD TO HIDE THE CITIGROUP
WRITTEN PROVISION IN THESPENDING BILL.
EITHER THAT OR TRY TO GETGET CONGRESS TO PASS THE
WE NEVER LEARN OUR [BEEP]LESSON ACT OF 2014.
WHY WOULD THE CONGRESS SNEAK INA PROVISION THAT BASICALLY
WAS JUST AN ENORMOUS GIVEAWAYTO BIG BANKS?
WHAT DOES CONGRESS GET ALMOSTDIRECTLY IN RETURN FOR THIS
FAVOR/INVESTMENT.
>> A LAST MINUTE CHANGE FROM THETOP REPUBLICAN LEADERS TO ALTER
CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES SO BIGDONORS CAN GIVE TEN TIMES MORE
MONEY.
UP TO $324,000.
>> Jon: BUT NOT A PENNY MORE.OBVIOUSLY I SHOULDN'T INSINUATE
THAT RAISING THE PERSONAL DONORLIMIT TO $324,000 IS TANTAMOUNT
TO PAY BACK FOR INCREASINGTHE BANK'S PROFITS. REALLY,
ANY INDIVIDUAL COULD GIVE$324,000, BE THEY A WALL STREET
BANKER WHO BENEFITED FROM THISCONGRESSIONAL LARGESSE
OR THE LOCAL JANITOR WHO ISLOOKING TO BANKRUPT HIMSELF.
[LAUGHING]BUT NOT EVERYONE IN CONGRESS
IS HAPPY WITH THESE SECRET DODDFRANK ROLLING BACK SHENANIGANS.
>> THAT'S WHY I WAS SO REALLYHEARTBROKEN.
I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER SAIDTHAT WORD ON THE FLOOR OF THE
HOUSE.
HEARTBROKEN TO SEE THE TAINTTHAT WAS PLACED ON THIS VALUABLE
APPROPRIATIONS BILL.
[LAUGHING][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHING][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I FOUND ITINTERESTING THAT THE GESTURE
SHE USED AFTER SAYING THEWORD "TAINT" WAS.
HOW SHORT IS SHE?
[LAUGHING] I'M SORRY. ALRIGHT.
IS THERE, IS THERE -- IS THERESOMEONE IN CONGRESS WHO CAN NOT
APPEAL TO ME IN SUCH ANADOLESCENT WAY.
>> WHO DOES CONGRESS WORK FOR?
DOES IT WORK FOR THEMILLIONAIRES?
THE BILLIONAIRES?
OR DOES IT WORK FOR ALL OF THEPEOPLE?
IT IS TIME FOR ALL OF US TOSTAND UP AND FIGHT.
>> Jon: IT'S SO CUTE. SHE THINKSSHE CAN CHANGE THE SYSTEM.
[LAUGHING]FRESHMEN. WELL, DON'T WORRY
ONE OF THE MEAN GIRLS WILL GETHER BACK IN LINE.
>>TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROMMASSACHUSETS, THERE IS SOMETHING
IN HERE YOU DON'T LIKE, WELCOMETO DEMOCRACY.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: WHAT, WHAT JUST HAPPENED
THERE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]YOU DON'T LIKE IT --
THAT IS DEMOCRACY.
SO, HE SAYS, LINDSAY GRAHAM SAYSWELCOME TO DEMOCRACY.
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THAT'S NOTDEMOCRACY.
DEMOCRACY IS WHAT HAPPENED WHENCONGRESS PASSED DODD FRANK,
FOLLOWING A VIGOROUS OPENDEBATE AND BIPARTISAN
COMPROMISE.
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK ISSOMEONE ANONYMOUSLY REPEALING
PART OF THAT AGREEMENTBY SNEAKING IT INTO AN UNRELATED
MUST-PASS BILL.
IT'S DEMOCRACY IN THE SAME WAYTHAT CHEESE WHIZ IS CHEESE.
IT LOOKS KIND OF SIMILAR FROM ADISTANCE BUT IT SURE TASTES LIKE
SOMEONE'S TAINT.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
