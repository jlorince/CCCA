>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK TO THE THEPROGRAM.
WE'RE TALKING WITH MALALAYOUSAFZAI, AWARDED A NOBEL PEACE
PRIZE LAUREATE.
THE EDUCATION FUND, AND YOU TALKABOUT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE--
THERE'S A LOT IN THE FILM OF YOUVISITING THESE SCHOOLS.
EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS AGENERATIONAL BENEFIT, AND WILL
TAKE TIME.
DO YOU GET IMPATIENT SOMETIMESWITH THE PROGRESS OF IT?
OR DO YOU SEE ENOUGH THAT ITLIFTS YOU ENOUGH TO KEEP GOING?
>> I DO GET DEPRESSED WHEN I SEETHAT THERE ARE 57 MILLION
CHILDREN WHO ARE DEPRIVED OFEDUCATION, ONLY AT THE PRIMARY
LEVEL.
AND THEN THERE ARE GIRLS,BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO CAN--
WHO HAVE BIG DREAMS BUT THEYDON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
GET EDUCATION.
SO IT IS DISAPPOINTING, BUT WHENYOU SEE BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO HAVE
THIS COURAGE TO STAND UP FORTHEIR RIGHTS, LIKE MOZOUN, A
SYRIAN REFUGEE WHO NOW LIVES INJORDAN.
AND SHE'S A WONDERFUL GIRL, ANDI HAVE MET HER, AND NOW SHE IS
HELPING GIRLS AND BOYS IN HERCOMMUNITY, IN THE CAMP SHE'S
LIVING, TO GO TO SCHOOL.
AND SHE'S ENCOURAGING THEM.
I HAVE MET MANY GIRLS IN NIGERIAWHEN I WENT THERE TO RAISE MY
VOICE FOR THE KIDNAPPEES INNIGERIA.
I MET BRILLIANT GIRLS THERE ASWELL.
AND FROM PAKISTAN.
SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE THEMSPEAKING.
AND I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE, WHEREVERI GO, I ENCOURAGE CHILDREN AND
PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WAITFOR SOMEONE ELSE TO SPEAK UP FOR
THEM.
IT'S-- THEIR VOICES ARE REALLYPOWERFUL AND THEY SHOULD SPEAK
UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS.
>> Jon:  IT'S SO INTERESTINGWHEN YOU WERE IN-- AND I CAN'T
REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS,IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN NIGERIA,
WHERE YOU WERE TALKING TO ABUNCH OF SCHOOL GIRLS AND SCHOOL
BOYS AND WHO WANTS TO BE ALAWYER, WHO WANTS TO BE A
DOCTOR?
AND SOMEONE WOULD RAISE THEIRHAND-- A VARIETY OF THEM-- AND I
THINK YOU SAID OR MAYBE YOURFATHER SAID, "WHO AMONG YOU HAS
PARENTS WHO ARE EDUCATED, WHOHAVE BEEN TO SCHOOL?"
>> NO.
>> Jon:  NOT ONE, NOT ONEHAND.
THIS IS REALLY THE FIRSTGENERATION IN MANY OF THESE
AREAS THAT HAVE EVER BEENEXPOSED TO THIS.
>> SO IT WAS REALLYDISAPPOINTING WHEN I WENT TO
KENYA THAT THESE GIRLS, THEYHAVE THIS DREAM TO GO TO SCHOOL.
THEY WISH FOR NOTHING ELSE, ANDTHIS AMBITION TO HELP THEIR
COMMUNITY, TO HELP PEOPLE, BUTWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS IN
SOCIETY THAT ARE STOPPING THEM,IT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING.
IN SOME PLACES THEY DON'T HAVEENOUGH MONEY.
IN SOME PLACES, EDUCATION IS NOTFREE.
IN SOME PLACES, THERE ARECULTURAL ISSUES.
SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE NOW KIND OFTELLING THE WORLD LEADERS,
ASKING THEM, 12 YEARS OFEDUCATION SHOULD BE MADE FREE,
AND IT IS OUR DEMAND FORSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS,
AND I HOPE WHEN THE WORLDLEADERS, WHEN THEY COME
TOGETHER, AND THEY MAKE THESECALLS, THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN.
AND IT'S NOT JUST THEIREDUCATION.
IT'S THEIR FUTURE --
>> Jon: AND OUR FUTURE.
>> DEFINITELY.
>> Jon:  WITHOUT THEM, ITDOESN'T WORK.
IT'S SO INTERESTING-- BOY, YOUDON'T HOLD BACK.
YOU MET WITH PRESIDENT BARACKOBAMA, AND TOLD HIM, DRONE
STRIKES, NO BUENO, PARDON YOURSPANISH.
AND WHEN YOU WENT TO NIGERIA ANDSAID TO GOODLUCK JONATHAN, "YOU
HAVE TO DO MORE AND YOU HAVE TOLISTEN TO YOUR PEOPLE."
AND YOU CAN ALMOST SEE, YOUKNOW, THERE'S THE FOOTAGE AND
AND GOODLUCK JOHNATHON, WHO ISNO LONGER THE LEADER THERE,
KINDA LIKE, HEY, WHAT, HUH?
HE REALLY WAS KIND OF TAKENABACK.
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL IN THE VERYCONCISE HONESTY.
>> YES, I THINK YOU HAVE TOSOMETIMES IGNORE ALL THE FORMAL
STUFF AND TELL THE TRUTH.
>> Jon:  BOY, YOU REALLY AREA TEENAGER.
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO, I THINK.
>> YES.
SO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND TELLTHE TRUTH.
THIS IS GOING WRONG.
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FORTHE WORLD LEADERS TO THINK THEIR
DECISION, WHAT'S THE IMPACT OFTHEIR DECISIONS ON COMMON PEOPLE
AND WHO IS-- WHO GETS AFFECTED.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND ALL THESE WARS,CONFLICTS, INNOCENT PEOPLE, THEY
GET KILLED, GET INJURED, THEYBECOME HOMELESS, THEY BECOME
MIGRANTS.
AND IT'S TRAGIC BECAUSE THEYHAVE TO SUFFER FOR THEIR WHOLE
LIFE, SO NOW I THINK THE WORLDLEADERS NEED TO BE QUITE SERIOUS
NOW.
>> Jon:  AND EVEN GOING ANDJUST BEARING WITNESS TO THEIR--
TO THEIR DESPAIR I THINK ISIMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DO-- YOU
KNOW, IN SYRIA, THEY HAD A LIFE,AND THIS CONFLICT-- THERE ARE
MILLIONS THAT HAVE HAD TO FLEE.
THEY WERE SHOPKEEPERS ANDACCOUNTANT AND DENTISTS, AND NOW
THEY LIVE IN A DESERT AND THEYHAVE TO KNOW THEY'RE NOT
FORGOTTEN.
>> DEFINITELY.
IN SOME COUNTRIES THEY ARE NOTEVEN GIVEN IDENTITY.
THEY ARE NOT EVEN-- THEY'RE NOTEVEN ACCEPTED AS REFUGEES.
IT'S REALLY TRAGIC.
AND I THINK RATHER THAN-- RATHERTHAN WE THINKING THEY SHOULD BE
HELPED, I THINK WE OURSELVESSHOULD COME FORWARD AND WE
SHOULD HELP THEM AND WE SHOULDALSO ASK THE WORLD LEADERS, ALL
THE COUNTRIES THAT THEY SHOULDTAKE IT SERIOUS.
>> Jon:  NORMALLY THIS ISTHE PART I WOULD TURN TO THE
CAMERA AND PROMOTE WHATEVERUNSTALLMENT OF "JURASSIC WORLD"
YOU ARE PROMOTIN, BUT I'M JUSTGOING TO SAY THE NAME OF YOUR
ORGANIZATION IS--
>> THE MALALA FUND.
>> Jon:  THE MALALA FUND.
AND PEOPLE CAN GET INVOLVED.
>> DEFINITELY.
AND I WOULD ASK ALL MY FRIENDS,ALL MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS, YOU
HAVE ALREADY SUPPORTED US A LOT,AND SUPPORT US MORE SO WE CAN
HELP MORE CHILDREN.
AND GIRLS IN NIGERIA, SO THEYCAN GO FORWARD.
THEY CAN GET THEIR EDUCATION,AND THEY CAN RAISE THEIR VOICE.
>> Jon:  I HAVE TO TELL YOUTHAT YOU ARE A WONDERFUL TONIC
FOR-- I FELT SOMEWHAT DESPARINGTODAY, BUT I THINK YOUR SINGLE
MINDEDNESS HAS HELPED LIFT A BITOF THAT FOG FOR ME, AND I REALLY
THANK YOU FOR THAT, EVEN THOUGHTHAT IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO DO THAT.
BUT THANK YOU.
