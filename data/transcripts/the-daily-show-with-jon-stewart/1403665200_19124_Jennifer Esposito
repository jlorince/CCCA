>> I KNOW, I HEARD. METOO.
>> Jon: YES. IT'S VERY PAINFUL,AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE PEOPLE THATIT'S A REAL THING.
>> I HAD TO CONVINCE PEOPLE FORPROBABLY 20-SOMETHING YEARS.
>> Jon: YES.
>> GOING TO DOCTOR AFTER DOCTORAFTER DOCTOR SAYING, YOU KNOW,
THIS SYMPTOM, THAT SYMPTOM,THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG,
AND THEM LOOKING AT MESAYING, MAYBE IT'S
THIS, IT'S THAT, HERE'S SOMEPROZAC.
>> Jon: SOME PROZAC?>> AND IT'S LIKE REALLY?
REALLY? IT'S NOT IN MY HEAD.
I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'SSOMETHING REALLY WRONG. AND,
IT TOOK IT TO THE POINT WHERE,FOR ME, PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THERE'S ABOUT 300 SYMPTOMS WITHTHIS DISEASE.
SO FOR ME...
>> Jon: WELL, EXPLAIN VERYQUICKLY...
>> YEAH.>> Jon: SO CELIAC DISEASE IS
QUITE DIFFERENT FROMWHAT IT'S CALLED, LIKE
GLUTEN SENSITIVITY, >> IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: THE MORE FADDISH OFTHOSE TYPES OF DIETS.
>> IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFERENT ANDTHAT CAUSES US A SEVERE PROBLEM.
BUT CELIAC DISEASE IS AAUTOIMMUNE DISEASE.
>> Jon: YES.>> SO, WE CAN'T HAVE GLUTEN.
IT BASICALLY, IT DESTROYS THEVILLI IN THE GUT, WHICH TAKES
ALL THE NUTRIENTS FROM THE FOODAND GIVES IT TO THE BODY.
SO BASICALLY, BY THE TIME I WASDIAGNOSED, MY FACE, MY SKIN WAS
PEELING OFF. MY KNEES WEREBUCKLING,
MY HAIR WAS FALLINGOUT. I MEAN...
>> Jon: AND YOU, YOU HADACTUAL...
THERE WERE SYMPTOMS THAT WEREEMOTIONAL, AS WELL.
>> EMOTIONAL BECAUSE PEOPLEDON'T UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE
SERATONIN IN THE BODY IS IN THEGUT.
SO ALL THE SERATONIN IS INCHARGE OF MAKING YOU FEEL GOOD,
YOUR MOOD, YOUR DEPRESSION,EVERYTHING.
BUT FOR ME, IT ATTACKED MYNERVOUS SYSTEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> SO I GOT... I HAD PANIC
ATTACKS LIKE YOU WOULDN'TBELIEVE.
>> Jon: SEE NOW, FOR THE BOY, HEWAS HAVING THESE TERRIBLE
EPISODES OF VOMITING AND THENHE GOT ANEMIC,
>> YEAH.>> Jon: AND WANDERED AROUND...
AND WE JUST THOUGHT, WEWERE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED...
>> OF COURSE.
>> Jon: AND FRIGHTENED THAT HEWAS DYING.
>> OF COURSE.
>> Jon: WE DIDN'T... WE COULDN'TFIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
>> AND THIS IS WHAT'S SOFRIGHTENING WHEN PEOPLE MAKE FUN
OF THIS GLUTEN INTOLERANCE ORGLUTEN EATING.
OH, WE'RE ALL ON FAD OR A DIET.
THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOUR SON,THERE ARE PEOPLE, I'VE HEARD
EVEN WORSE STORIES...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THATARE SERIOUSLY SUFFERING.
>> Jon: WELL, IT'S DIFFERENT.IT'S A DISEASE.
>> IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING.
THIS BOOK SERIOUSLY, IT TOOK METHREE YEARS TO WRITE.
AND I WANTED TO WRITE IT EXACTLYFOR THIS REASON.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S A BOOK FOR EVERYONEWHO'S EVER HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING'S WRONG AND REALLYBE YOUR OWN HEALTH ADVOCATE.
>> Jon: RIGHT, NOW TO BE, TO GETDIAGNOSED, THOUGH, THEY HAVE TO,
THIS IS IMPORTANT, THEY HAVE TOACTUALLY DO AN ENDOSCOPY,
THEY DO LIKE A BIOPSY OF YOURLOWER INTESTINE. YOUR VILLI.
>> EXACTLY. THE SMALLINTESTINE. THE VILLI.
SO BASICALLY THAT HAVE DO THAT.I MEAN,
LOOK, THERE IS A BLOOD TEST, BUTIT'S NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE.
THEY TESTED ME FOR YEARS.
IT WAS LIKE, OH, NOTHING'S WRONGWITH YOU.
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NOW,YOU'VE STARTED A, THERE'S A,
YOU DO YOU A BAKERY NOW CALLEDJENNIFER'S WAY.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Jon: DID YOU THINK, WELL IT'SA BAKERY, IT SHOULD BE A PUN,
LIKE GLUTEN FOR PUNISHMENT?SOMETHING LIKE THAT. DID YOUEVER?
>> I HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING LIKETHAT. YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, IT'S,
I'M AN ITALIAN, AND TELLING METHAT I COULDN'T HAVE
GLUTEN AND DAIRY AND SOY...
>> Jon: OH IT MUST HAVE BEEN...
>> I WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO BEVERY ANGRY OR I NEED BAKE AND
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. SO IOPENED THIS BAKERY.
AND IT'S FOR ALL ALLERGENS.
AND WE ACTUALLY JUST OPENED AWHOLE FACILITY THAT WE CAN SHIP
ANYWHERE IN THE NATION.
BECAUSE HONESTLY, CELIAC OR NOT,I THINK IT'S COMING TO A POINT
WHERE FOOD IS SO MESSED UP THATWE JUST WANT GOOD, CLEAN FOOD.
GLUTEN-FREE OR NOT GLUTEN-FREE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> JUST A CLEAN PRODUCT WITHOUTALL THIS NONESENSE.
[APPLAUSE]>> I ACTUALLY THINK, THOUGH,
IT'S VERY NICE, YOU KNOW, THEWAY FOOD IS GOING,
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING TO ACERTAIN POINT WHERE ACTUALLY
EVERYTHING WILL BE GLUTEN FREEBECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO FOOD IN
IT.
>> THAT'S IT. IT'S AIR.>> Jon: SO YOU'LL HAVE...
>> I MAKE BREAD OUT OF AIR.
>> Jon: RIGHT I'LL JUST, OH I'MGOING TO HAVE SOME PLASTIC Os.
>> EXACTLY, EXACTLY. IT'SGETTING TO THAT POINT.
>> Jon: AND IT FEELS VERYDELICIOUS.
>> Jon: I WILL SAY THIS, YOUKNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU WENT TO BE DIAGNOSED,BUT WE FOUND A CENTER HERE
IN NEW YORK UP AT COLUMBIAPRESBYTERIAN, AND IT WAS GREAT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND, THEY SAVED THEBOY'S EXISTENCE.
>> HIS LIFE, EXACTLY.
>> Jon: AND, IF YOU CANSTAY AWAY FROM IT,
YOU REALLY DO START THE HEAL.THERE REALLY IS A CURE FOR THIS.
>> YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN HEAL.
BUT WHAT I ALWAYS TELL EVERYONE,LOOK FOR ME, JUST TAKING AWAY
GLUTEN WASN'T IT.
AND IT IS AN AUTOIMUNE DISEASE.
AND LIKE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR SON,IT'S EVERY DAY.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IT'S EVERY DAY AND EVERYTHINGWE EAT, EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT
TO DINNER.
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEE OTHERPEOPLE MAKING FUN OF THIS, IT'S
REALLY NOT FUNNY BECAUSE GOINGOUT THE DINNER IS NOT ENJOYABLE
ANYMORE FOR ME.
>> Jon: NO. WELL, IT'S ADIFFERENT THING. I THINK THAT
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THERE'STHIS WHOLE OTHER GROUP
THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE BELIEVEHAVE JUMPED ON KIND OF IT AS
A FAD...
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: LIKE YOU WOULDSOMETHING...
>> WHEN THEY SAY, LIKE THEFAT-FREE, BUT MY POINT IS THE
FAT-FREE WASN'TATTACHED TO A DISEASE.
THIS IS ATTACHED TO A DISEASE.
>> Jon: YES. YES. THAT'SCORRECT.
