>> CHAOS AND DESPAIR.
>> THE SITUATION IS SO DIRE.
>> THE CRISIS AT HAND DEMANDSACTION.
>> UNLESS WE SIT DOWN AND REASONTOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO END UP
WITH THE STATUS QUO.
>> Jon: SO ALL WE NEED TO SAVEOURSELVES IS FOR CONGRESS TO SIT
DOWN AND REASON.
[LAUGHTER]TOGETHER.
OH, MY GOD!
[SCREAMING MANIACALLY]CAN THEY DO IT?
[LAUGHTER]DID THEY DO IT?
BECAUSE ACTUALLY, SPOILER ALERT,YOU COULD HAVE WATCHED THE NEWS
BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY ANDYOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW, BUT
IF YOU DID NOT BECAUSE YOU WEREAT THE THEATER, HERE'S HOW IT
WENT DOWN STARTING ON JULY8th:
>> THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY ASKEDCONGRESS FOR $3.7 BILLION TO
DEAL WITH THE FLOOD OFUNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN COMING
INTO THE UNITED STATESILLEGALLY.
>> Jon: OKAY.
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ASKED FORIT BY PUTTING IT ON A WHITE
BOARD ON A FENCE.
$3.7 BILLION DOLLARS.
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
CONGRESS?
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO WRITEBLANK CHECK FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: REAL, REAL QUICK, YOU DO
REALIZE HOUSE CHAIRMAN OFHOMELAND SECURITY, THAT A
BLANK CHECK CAN'T BE FORA SPECIFIC NUMBER.
YOU KNOW THAT?
ONCE YOU WRITE A SPECIFICNUMBER, $4 BILLION, $2 BILLION,
WHATEVER IT IS, IT LOSES THEVITAL QUALITY OF BLANKNESS.
IT'S NOT BLANK ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD REALLYELECT PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW HOW
CHECKS WORK.
[LAUGHTER]SIR, THERE'S NO AMOUNT HERE.
SIR, YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN,YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN...
IT'S JUST A STICK FIGURE WITHBAGS OF MONEY ON IT.
I KNOW.
I WANT TO DEPOSIT THE MONEY, BUTTHE GUY WON'T TELL ME HOW MUCH
MONEY IS IN THE BAGS.
[LAUGHTER]SO, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND
$3.7 BILLION ON THIS, FINE,SMASH CUT JULY 31st.
>> THE SENATE'S OWN $2.7 BILLIONPLAN FAILED TO PASS A
PRELIMINARY VOTE THIS WEEK.
>> Jon: KNOCKED A BILLIONDOLLARS OFF IT AND STILL BLOCKED
IT. OF COURSE. IS THERE ANYBODYWITH AN IDEA OUT THERE
HOW TO SOLVE THIS HUMANITARIANCRISIS, ANYBODY AT ALL?
>> HOUSE REPUBLICANS ROLLING OUTTHEIR OWN PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS.
>> Jon: IS THERE ANYBODY?
ANYBODY?
ANYBODY WHO'S GOT SOME IDEASABOUT HOW THE DEAL... ANYBODY?
>> THESE ARE JUST LITTLE KIDSTHAT ARE COMING OVER, AND YOU'RE
CALLING FOR A SHOOT-TO-KILL.
>> LITTLE KIDS?
>> Jon: SO WE KNOW THAT IF INTHE ABSENCE OF CONGRESSIONAL
ACTION, THE KU KLUX KLAN ISREADY TO FILL THE VOID.
>> IN OUR TEN-MINUTE INTERVIEW,THE KLAN MEMBERS LISTED THEIR
USUAL GRIEVANCES -- BLACK, JEWSAND GAYS, AND NOW IMMIGRANTS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, AS LONG ASWE'RE LISTING GRIEVANCES, AND
YOU MAY SEE THIS AS A MINORPOINT, A BIT NICK PICKY,
BUT FLIP-FLOPS,DUDE, REALLY? FLIP FLOPS?
I MEAN, THESE ARE, THESE AREYOUR GOOD SATIN ROBES.
THESE ARE THE BIG ROBES.
I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE THEFORMAL ROBES.
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT ANEIGHT-YEAR-OLD AT THE BEACH.
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN WHO, ALBEITLIKES TO DRESS UP IN BED SHEETS
AND SET FIRE TO THINGS.
LOOK, I DON'T CARE IF IT'SSUMMER WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU'RE ON
TELEVISION.
PUT ON A NICE PAIR OF SLACKS ANDSOME REAL SHOES.
NO ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVEYOU'RE THE MASTER RACE IF THEY
THINK YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TIEYOUR LACES.
[LAUGHTER]SO, ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN THEKLAN PLAN AND OUR HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
UM, ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO WITH THEHOUSE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKEDCONGRESS FOR $3.7 BILLION TO
ADDRESS THE CRISIS ON THEBORDER.
>> SPEAKER BOEHNER TRIMMED THATDOWN TO ABOUT $1.5 BILLION, BUT
THE HOUSE APPROPRIATIONSCOMMITTEE CUT THAT EVEN
FURTHER, $659 MILLION.
>> Jon: WHAT? THAT'S NOT IN THEEVEN IN THE SAME BALLPARK...
THAT'S NOT EVEN IN THE SAME...THAT'S NOT A NEGOTIATION...
IT'S LIKE THIS MAN NEEDS A HEARTTRANSPLANT.
OH, HEART TRANSPLANT?
WELL, HOW ABOUT IF I GIVE HIMFOUR POSSUM HEARTS AND A
TRANSISTOR RADIO?[LAUGHTER].
BUT I GUESS COMPARED TO THESENATE'S NOTHING BILL, THE HOUSE
AT LEAST HAS ACTUAL LEGISLATION.
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS PASS THISBILL AND THEY ALL LOOK LIKE
HEROES.
>> TED CRUZ, THE JUNIOR SENATORFROM TEXAS, HE HAD PARTY IN TOWN
HERE IN D.C. ON WEDNESDAY,SERVING BEER AND PIZZA.
HE TOLD MEMBERS OF THECONSERVATIVE CAUCUS THAT THEY
SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR ANYLEGISLATION ON THE ISSUE OF THE
BORDER.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: UH, FIRST OF ALL, ILOVE HOW WHEN A BRITISH GUY SAYS
"BEER AND PIZZA," HE MAKES ITSOUND LIKE [BLEEPED] VOMIT.
APPARENTLY THEY HAD PARTY WHERETHEY HAD BEER AND PIZZA.
AH, OH.
AND SECOND OF ALL, WHO CARESABOUT SENATOR TED CRUZ.
HE'S IN THE SENATE.
THEY ALREADY DID THEIR NOTHING.
PIZZA OR NO PIZZA, SCREW THATGUY.
WHO CARES WHAT HE THINKS?
>> G.O.P. LEADERSHIP CANCELED AVOTE YESTERDAY ON A $659 MILLION
BORDER BILL.
>> THEY COULDN'T GATHER THEVOTES NEEDED.
>> Jon: THE HOUSE REPUBLICANSWERE SO CLOSE TO THE APPEARANCE
OF DOING SOMETHING.
AND THEIR PLAN WAS SABOTAGED ANDWITH PIZZA NO LESS.
THIS MAY BE PIZZA'S DARKESTHOURS.
[LAUGHTER]SECOND ONLY THE WHEN THE NAZIS
INVADE FRANCE UNDER THISPRETENSE OF DELIVERING FIVE
MILLION OF THEM.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]OH, WE CAN'T USE DOMINO'S.
IS THAT FOR REAL?
EARLIER IT WAS DOMINO'S.
I DON'T KNOW.
NOW IT'S CHANGED TO THIS BIZARREANGELO'S PIZZA.
TALK ABOUT SOME CRAZY BREAD.
SO, SO WHAT TOPPINGS DID THECRUZ CONTINGENT OF THE HOUSE PUT
ON THEIR [BLEEPED] YOU PIZZA?
>> THE NEW VERSION WOULD ALSOGIVE $35 MILLION TO BORDER STATE
GOVERNORS TO PAY FOR NATIONALGUARD TROOPS.
IN ADDITION, IT WOULD TWEAKLANGUAGE IN THAT 2008
ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAW THAT WOULDMAKE IT EASIER TO QUICKLY DEPORT
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THE SENATEIS ALREADY OUT SO NOTHING IN
THIS BILL MATTERS ANYWAY.
WHY NOT HAVE SOME FUN WITH THIS?
MINORS MUST BE DEPORTED VIACIRCUS CANNON OR REPLACE THE
BORDER FENCE WITH A WIPEOUTCOURSE, AND IF YOU GET THROUGH,
HEY, YOU'RE IN.
[LAUGHTER]DRESS THE BORDER PATROL UP AS
MOUNTIES SO THEY THINK THEY'VECOME HERE AND GONE TOO FAR AND
TURN BACK AROUND.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]I MEAN, THIS IS SO INSANE.
WE HAD AN URGENT CRISIS ON THESOUTHERN BORDER.
THE PRESIDENT OFFERS A SOLUTION.
THE SENATE CAN'T EVEN GET THEIRSTO AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE, AND THE
HOUSE PASSES A DRACONIAN VERSIONTHAT SOMEHOW MOVES TO THE RIGHT
OF ITSELF.
AT THIS POINT CAN ANYTHING BEDONE?
>> BOEHNER RELEASED A STATEMENTAFTER HE YANKED THE BILL SAYING
THIS, "THERE ARE NUMEROUS STEPSTHE PRESIDENT CAN AND SHOULD BE
TAKING RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THENEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION."
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: DID JOHN BOEHNER JUST
SUGGEST THAT IF CONGRESS WON'TACT TO CHANGE A LAW IT
DOESN'T LIKE THEPRESIDENT SHOULD?
CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'SA GUY RIGHT NOW SUING THE
PRESIDENT FOR THAT.
>> HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER TOSUE U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
>> Jon: WOW.
IF BOEHNER EVER GETS AHOLD OFTHAT OTHER BOEHNER, HIS FACE IS
GONNA BE SO REDDISH ORANGE.
[LAUGHTER]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE][CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
