>> Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
ANY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT MR. JOSH BROLIN IS GOING TO BE HERE.
HE WILL TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE WITH ZEN BUDDAHISM LIKE JEFF BRIDGES LAST NIGHT
THAT HIS TO REWATCH TO UNDERSTAND.
OUR CREDIT GOT DOWNGRADED LAST YEAR.
I THINK WE CAN AGREE IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS TO FIGURE OUT TO RESTORE THE WORLD'S RESPECT FOR
THE SOUNDNESS OF CURN CINCH A $1 TRILLION PLATINUM DOWN BE MINTED AND THE GOVERNMENT COULD USE
THAT TO PAY THE DEBT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: UM, I'M --
[ LAUGHTER ]
AH NOT AN ECONOMIST --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE (bleep) UP, I SAY GOOD BIG OR GO HOME.
HOW BY DOOL 20 TRILLION COIN.
FORGET ABOUT IT SAY I WAS DIGGING THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE CURBS AND EISENHOWER HAD THE
$100QUILLION COIN AROUND.
I KNOW IT'S REAL BECAUSE IT HAS OUR NATION'S SYMBOL A UNIFORM WITH A CENTURE.
THAT TRADITIONAL AMERICA IS GONE NOW, PLEASE DON'T LOOK THAT UP.
HOW WOULD IT WORK?
>> IN THEORY THE TREASURY WOULD MINT THE COIN AND WALK IT OVER THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR DEPOSIT
SO THE GOVERNMENT COULD PAY IT BILLS.
>> Jon: REALLY?
REALLY MR. TIBBL SNERKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T WANT TO BUST YOUR BIBBLES HERE, BUT YOU KNOW YOU ARE ONLY HOLDING A QUARTER,
SNRIET SURE THEY COULD MINT A TRILLION DOLLAR COIN AND WALK IT OVER THE TREASURY EVEN THOUGH IT
COULD BE THE MOST TEMPTING WALK IN HISTORY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE STORE ACROSS THE STREET IS
CHOCOLATE, BLOWJOBS AND BEYOND.
YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO --
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED SOME TRILLION DOLLAR COIN GIMMICK.
WE NEED TO TAKE THE U.S. DOLLAR SERIOUS AGAIN.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL NOMINATE HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE WHITE HOUSE JACK LEW TOLL BET NEXT --
TO BE THE NEXT TREASURY SECRETARY.
>> IT WILL BE HIS SIGNATURE AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR CURRENCY.
IT WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: THAT INJURE SIGNATURE?
OR JUT -- THAT IS YOUR SIGNIFICANT IN SIGNATURE OR ARE YOU TESTING TO SEE IF THE
PEN WORKS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
HEY, LEW, SHIRE -- HERE IS A TIP, STOP SIGNING YOUR CHECKS ON THE TEACUP RIDE AT DISNEY WORLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THAT AS YOUR SIGNATURE IS IF YOUR NAME IS BOOOOING,
BOOOING, PLEASE COME FIRM JACK LEW.
PLEASE CONFIRM JACK LEW.
I HAVE TO HAVE THIS MAN AS TREASURY SECRETARY.
SERIOUSLY IF THIS GUY GETS CONFIRMED IT WOULD BE THE SECOND MOST RIDICULOUS SIGNATURE ONLY
TO APPEAR ON OUR MONEY THANKS TO BUCHANAN'S SECRETARY OLIVER LEWIS OTTINGHAM.
I SEE THE AUDIENCE WENT TO SEVENTH GRADE LIKE I DID.
[ LAUGHTER ]
