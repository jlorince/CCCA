MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR, HERNEW BOOK IS CALLED "WITHOUT YOU,
THERE IS NO US: MY TIME WITHTHE SONS OF NORTH KOREA'S ELITE"
PLEASE WELCOME SUKI KIM. HELLO!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOININGUS.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN A MEMOIR ABOUTYOUR TIME "WITHOUT YOU THERE IS
NO US," TEACHING IN A NORTHKOREAN PRIVATE SCHOOL.
>> YES.
>> Jon:  HUH?
( LAUGHTER )HOW DID YOU GET THAT-- IS THAT
A CRAIGSLIST SITUATION? HOW --HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE
JOB AND-- HOW DIDYOU END UP THERE?
>> WELL, I WENT UNDER COVERBECAUSE I'M NOT A TEACHER.
( LAUGHTER )SO, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A LONG-- I
PURSUED A TOPIC SINCE 2002, WHENI FIRST WENT INTO NORTH KOREA,
AND THEN I FOUND OUT THERE ISTHIS PRIVATE SCHOOL THAT IS
BUILT, AND I APPLIED FOR AJOB AND THAT WAS IT.
>> Jon:  WHAT STRUCK ME INREADING IT IS I THINK I HAVE IN
MY HEAD A VERSION OF AMECHANIZED, SOULLESS PLACE OF
GRAY.
THE JOY, THE UPS AND DOWNS, THEYARE KIDS.
THEY'RE 19-YEAR-OLD KIDS.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,BASICALLY, THE BOOK -- I ALWAYS
WANT TO HUMANIZE NORTH KOREABECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY GET ANY
REAL PICTURE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE ONLY GET THE STORIESOF DEFECTORS, ONCE THEY'VE FLED
NORTH KOREA, OR WE WOULD GET THEWHOLE KIM JONG IL JOKES, AND
KIM JONG UN JOKES NOW.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN NUCLEAR THREATS.THESE ARE THE ONLY THINGS WE
KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA. AND NOWI GUESS DENNIS RODMAN.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BUT, I MEAN, WHO ARE --
>> Jon: IS HE THE ONLYTHING THEY KNOW ABOUT US?
>> I THINK POSSIBLY, YES.
>> Jon:  SO WE'RE REALLYMISSING EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT A VERY GOODMEETING.
>> Jon: BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYACCESS -- WHAT WAS FASCINATING
TO ME IS, SO THIS IS THE ELITEOF THE ELITE AS FAR
AS YOUNG PEOPLE. THESE ARECOMPUTER WIZARDS.
THESE ARE ENGINEERS. THESE AREPEOPLE STUDYING-- BUT THEY DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNET.
>> IT WAS PYONGYANG UNIVERSITYOF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> A LOT OF THEIR MAJORS -- SOTHIS IS BASICALLY THE M.I.T. OF
NORTH KOREA, AND THEIR MAJORSWERE COMPUTERS, A LOT OF THEM.
IN 2011, WHEN I WAS THERE, THEYDIDN'T KNOW THE EXISTENCE OF THE
INTERNET.
>> Jon:  SO WHAT ARE THEYSTUDYING?
( LAUGHTER )IF IT'S COMPUTERS, IS IT, LIKE,
"AND LOOK, YOU HAVE A CALCULATORON IT, YOU CAN DO LIKE--"
WHAT DOES A COMPUTER DO?
WHAT CAN THEY TEACH THEM WHENYOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT?
>> I MEAN, THAT YEAR WHEN I WASTHERE, THEY WEREN'T TEACHING
COMPUTER AT ALL.
>> Jon:  OH, THEY WEREN'T.
>> THEY WERE ONLY TEACHING THEMENGLISH.
BECAUSE 2011 WAS AN EXCEPTIONALYEAR, IT WAS THE YEAR JUCHE 100.
NORTH KOREA DOESN'T FOLLOW OURCALENDAR SYSTEM.
THEY FOLLOW IT FROM THE BIRTH OFTHEIR ORIGINAL GREAT LEADER.
SO, JUCHE, HE'S FOUNDINGPHILOSOPHY, MEANING SELF
RELIANCE.>> Jon: OKAY.
>> TO CELEBRATE JUCHE 100,TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY,
ALTHOUGH HE DIED IN 1994, THEYPUT ALL -- THEY CLOSED DOWN ALL
THE UNIVERSITIES AND PUT ALL THEUNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN
CONSTRUCTION FIELDS.
>> Jon:  TO CELEBRATE.
>> TO CELEBRATE.
TO BUILD A NATION.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS DURING CHRISTMASBREAK. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE!
>> Jon:  WHAT HAPPENS TOTHEM NOW?
YOU KNOW, IS IT JUST-- YOU KNOW,IT IS SO ALL-ENCOMPASSING.
DO THEY JUST GO THROUGH THEPRODUCTION LINE INTO A
MILITARIZED ENVIRONMENT ANDTHAT'S IT?
>> I THINK THAT I JUST WANTTHEM TO, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE
FUTURE LEADERS OF NORTH KOREA.THEY WERE,
WHEN ALL THE UNIVERSITIES WERESHUT, THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES
WHO WERE ALLOWED TO BE HIDING INTHIS PRIVATE UNIVERSITY PLAYING
BASKETBALL-- I PLAYED BASKETBALLWITH THEM.
THEY LOVE BASKETBALL.
AND I ATE THREE MEALS A DAY WITHTHEM.
AND SO THEY WERE CREME DA LACREME OF NORTH KOREA.
AND THEY WERE JUST SO LOVELY,BECAUSE I THINK THEY WERE ALSO
SO SHELTERED FROM THE WORLD, BUTTHEIR SYSTEM WAS NOT LOVELY.
THEIR SYSTEM WAS MOST INHUMANSYSTEM IN THE WORLD.
SO THEY WERE PERPETUALLY SCARED.
THEY WERE ALWAYS WATCHING EACHOTHER, REPORTING ON EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THIS WAS A VERY, IT'S ASYSTEM BUILT ON FEAR.
IT WAS -- THEY DIDN'T HAVE ASINGLE MINUTE ALONE.
AND ALL THEIR LIVES WERE ABOUTTHE GREAT LEADER.
THEY TOOK GREAT LEADERCLASSES EVERY DAY.
THEY DID GREAT LEADER DUTIES.
SO I THINK THEY ARE BASICALLYREARED TO BE THE FUTURE LEADERS,
AND I THINK THAT WAS MY DILEMMABEING THERE, BECAUSE I WANTED
SO MUCH TO TELL THEMABOUT THE WORLD BUT IF I DID,
THEN IT COULD BEDANGEROUS FOR THEM.
>> Jon:  AND FOR YOU.
>> FOR ME AT THE TIME, YEAH,BECAUSE I WAS UNDER COVER.
I WAS -->> RIGHT.
>> I MEAN I GUESS IF I GOTCAUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED
A SPY.
>> Jon:  RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> WHICH I GUESS I WAS.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon: RIGHT. WELL THAT,
WELL, THAT WAS A TWIST.
( LAUGHTER )I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
( LAUGHTER )THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
IT'S A PHENOMENAL-- IT'S A BOOKLIKE NO OTHER BOOK I THINK I'VE
EVER READ.
LIKE IT'S A LOOK INTO A SOCIETY,INTO A CULTURE, BUT OBJECTIVELY
AND HUMANIZING AND TERRIFYINGAND REALLY AMAZING BOOK.
"WITHOUT YOU, THERE IS NO US."
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
SUKI KIM, THANK YOU.
