SO AS REPUBLICANS ABSORB THE
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CHRISTIE IS
REALLY, TRULY, UNEQUIVOCALLY
PROBABLY NOT RUNNING AND
REPUBLICANS CONTINUE CHECKING
UNDERNEATH EVERY AVAILABLE FLAG
PIN AND BIBLE FOR VIABLE
CANDIDATES, PRESUME DEFACTO
FRONT-RUNNER CANDIDATE MITT
ROMNEY'S GOT TO BE THINKING WHAT
THE FUDGE?
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS STARTING TO HURT WHERE
MY FEELINGS SHOULD BE.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, ROMNEY HAS BEEN RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
... SINCE 2007!
ROMNEY'S THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF
THE STATE WHERE THE ACTUAL TEA
PARTY HAPPENED.
HE'S THE SON OF A POPULAR
MIDWESTERN GOVERNOR.
HE'S RICH.
HE LOOKS LIKE A GUY YOU'D CAST
AS THE PRESIDENT IN A MOVIE.
AND NOT A MOVIE WHERE THE
PRESIDENT IS CORRUPT OR AN
ASTEROID IS ABOUT TO HIT THE
EARTH BUT MORE OF A LIGHT
HEARTED PRESIDENT DAD TYPE
MOVIE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHERE HE COMMANDS AN ARMY BUT
CAN'T CONNECT WITH HIS KIDS.
I MEAN, THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO
MITT ROMNEY WINNING NEXT YEAR'S
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IS THAT UP
UNTIL VERY, VERY RECENTLY THEY
WAS ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING
REPUBLICANS SAND FOR.
>> LOOK, I WAS AN INDEPENDENT
DURING THE TIME OF REAGAN/BUSH.
I'M NOT TRYING TO RETURN TO
REAGAN/BUSH.
I DO NOT TAKE THE POSITION OF A
PRO-LIFE CANDIDATE.
I'M IN FAVOR OF PRESERVING AND
PROTECTING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO
CHOOSE.
>> Jon: TO BE FAIR TO ROMNEY,
AT THAT TIME HE DID BELIEVE VERY
DEEPLY IN HIS HEART THAT HE
WANTED TO BE ELECTED GOVERNOR OF
MASSACHUSETTS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT NOW IT'S 2011.
HE'S NOT AN IRRESPONSIBLE KID IN
HIS MID-50s ANYMORE.
HE'S MATURED AND LEARNED AN
IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT WANTING
TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.
YES, MITT ROMNEY HAS A LITTLE
BIT OF A PROBLEM, AND THAT'S THE
WIN TO REPUBLICAN NOMINATION HE
HAS TO CONVINCE REPUBLICAN
VOTERS HE'S NOT ACTUALLY MITT
ROMNEY.
>> MY VIEW IS THAT THE SUPREME
COURT SHOULD REVERSE "ROE V.
WADE."
>> WOULD YOU HAVE SUPPORTED A
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT
WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED THE
DEFINITION OF LIFE AT
CONCEPTION?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I AM PRO-LIFE.
> Jon: I'M IF PRO LIFE AS IN.>
"HEY, I LIED BEFORE.
THAT'S LIFE."
(LAUGHTER)
HOW HARD WILL HIS PAST BE?
HERE'S ROMNEY'S 2003 STATE OF
THE STATE ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR OF
MASSACHUSETTS IN WHICH HE
PROMISED "WE'LL PLUG CORPORATE
TAX LOON HOLES TO COMPANIES WILL
PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE."
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T HAVE
THAT QUOTE ON VIDEO.
BUT WE FOUND A NEARLY IDENTICAL
SENTIMENT.
>> LET'S CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES,
LET'S ELIMINATE THOSE TAX BREAKS
AND LET'S MAKE SURE THAT
EVERYBODY'S PAYING THEIR FAIR
SHARE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
I CAN'T BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY'S A
SOCIALIST MUSLIM KENYAN!
(LAUGHTER)
>> IN MINUTE, A LOOPHOLE IS WHEN
SOMEONE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A TAX
LAW IN A WAY THAT WASN'T
INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATION.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO USE THE WORD LOOPHOLE TO SAY
"LET'S JUST RAISE TAXES ON
PEOPLE" AND THAT I WILL NOT DO.
I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES.
>> Jon: HOLY BLOOP, I THINK HE
FOUND A LOOPHOLE TO GET AROUND
THE WORD LOOPHOLE.
AND NOT ONLY DOES ROMNEY HAVE TO
DISAVOW HIS POSITION, AS FORMER
GOVERNOR AND VETERAN OF TWO
OTHER UNSUCCESSFUL POLITICAL
CAMPAIGNS FOR SENATE AND
PRESIDENT ALSO HAS TO DISAVOW
HIS CHOSEN VOCATION.
>> I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU
WOULD TELL MY CLASS THAT WOULD
MAKE US WANT TO BE POLITICIANS.
>> SHE WOULD ASK ME WHAT I WOULD
TELL HER CLASSMATES TO ENCOURAGE
THEM TO BECOME A POLITICIAN.
AND THE ANSWER IS NOTHING.
DON'T DO IT.
RUN.
RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN.
>> Jon: RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN.
YOU SEE, I'M NO GOOD, KID.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M A BAD MAN.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ME.
(LAUGHTER)
POLITICS IS DIRTY.
ACTUALLY, ROMNEY'S JUST TELLING
THOSE KIDS NOT TO GO INTO
POLITICS BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF
THEY DID THEY WOULD BE THE NEW
REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNERS.
(LAUGHTER)
SEE, ROMNEY'S NOT A MODERATE,
ROMNEY'S NOT A MODERATE
PRO-CHOICE WEALTH REDISTRIBUTING
CORPORATE LOOPHOLE CLOSING
CAREER POLITICIAN.
HE'S A TEA PARTY PRO-LIFE
OUTSIDER.
AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THIS
QUARTER OF A BILLIONAIRE WANTS
YOU TO KNOW BEFORE YOU VOTE FOR
HIM.
>> WE OUGHT TO PROVIDE HOPE THE
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT
MOST BY THE OBAMA ECONOMY AND
THAT'S THE MIDDLE-CLASS.
IT'S FOR THE GREAT MIDDLE-CLASS.
THE 80% TO 90% OF US IN THIS
COUNTRY.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: WHO YOU CALLING "US"?
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO... THE
TRANSFORMATION IS COMPLETE.
WHERE IN THE WORLD, MITT ROMNEY,
ARE YOU MIDDLE-CLASS?
YOU'RE NOT MIDDLE-CLASS AT A
REUNION OF YOUR HARVARD BUSINESS
SCHOOL COLLEAGUES.
YOU WOULDN'T BE MIDDLE-CLASS AT
AN OPEC MEETING.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I GUESS IT'S NICE TO KNOW
EVEN IF REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOW
WHO THE REAL MITT ROMNEY IS,
MITT ROMNEY
