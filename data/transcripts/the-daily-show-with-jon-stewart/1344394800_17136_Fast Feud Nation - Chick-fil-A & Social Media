WELCOME TO DALE DALE.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SAIMA WAHAB,
SHE'S WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE GOING UP IN AFGHANISTAN AND PORTLAND,
OREGON.
(LAUGHS) SISTER CITIES.
YOU KNOW THE SAYING "YOU ARE WHERE YOU EAT?" YOU DON'T?
BECAUSE I HAVE MADE THAT UP.
AND YET FOR THE COUNTRY'S LEADING CONSERVATIVES.
TWEET AGO PICTURE OF THEMSELVES WITH CHICK-FIL-A RECENTLY BECAME A GREAT WAY TO EXPRESS
OPPOSITION TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
A LITMUS LUNCH, IF YOU WILL.
PALIN, HUCKABEE, LIMBAUGH, EVEN,
SURPRISINGLY, THIS MIDDLE AGED LESBIAN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) HAS A...
(LAUGHTER).
(LAUGHS) ARE YOU SURE?
THAT'S ACTUALLY SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.
(LAUGHTER) LINDSAY'S A BOY'S NAME?
NO.
NO, THAT'S A LESBIAN!
OKAY.
ANYWAY, LAST WEEK GRAHAM POSTED HIS PICTURE ON FACEBOOK SAYING "AS A LONG TIME CHICK-FIL-A
FANATIC I STAND WITH CHICK-FIL-A.
WE HAD IT FOR BREAKFAST TODAY BUT MY USUAL ORDER IS THE NUMBER ONE ORD WE ARE LAW IS AND A COKE ZERO.
" COKE ZERO!
DOESN'T HE KNOW THAT IS THE GAYEST COKE!
(LAUGHTER) EVEN DIET CAFFEINE FREE COKE IS LIKE "GIVE IT A REST, COKE ZERO." (LAUGHTER)
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD?
>> I'M WAITING IN LINE, NEXT IN LINE, PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT MY FREE WATER.
>> YOU KNOW WHY I'M GETTING A FREE WATER, RIGHT?
>> I DO NOT.
>> BECAUSE CHICK-FIL-A IS A HATEFUL CORPORATION.
>> I DISAGREE, I WOULDN'T... WE DON'T TREAT ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS DIFFERENTLY.
>> Jon: THAT GENTLEMAN IS A SUPPORTER OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND HE'S APPARENTLY CONFUSING
THIS WELL-MANNERED HOURLY SHIFT WORKER FOR MRS. CHICK-FIL-A.
(LAUGHTER) I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS CHICK-FIL-A COMPANY POLICY IS SET BY THE GUY WORKING THE
WAFFLE FRIES.
(LAUGHTER) LOOK, MAN, OH, MAN, THIS GUY WASN'T DUN SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWERLESSNESS.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF AND WORK HERE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
THIS IS A HORRIBLE CORPORATION WITH HORRIBLE VALUES.
>> WE'RE HERE TO SERVE YOU IN ANY WAY THAT YOU NEED.
I HOPE OFF REALLY NICE DAY.
>> I WILL.
I DID SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.
I FEEL PURPOSEFUL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: OH, I SHOULD CLARIFY,
MY PURPOSE IS TO BE A DICK.
(LAUGHTER) THE BEST PART OF THAT DEAL?
THAT DUDE POSTED THAT VIDEO!
HIMSELF!
(LAUGHTER) HE UPLOADED THAT TO A COMPUTER AND IS LIKE "WAIT UNTIL THE WORLD SEES THIS!"
AND WHY NOT?
HE HAD NOTHING TO BE PERSONALLY ASHAMED OF.
>> I'M A NICE GUY, BY THE WAY.
AND I'M TOTALLY HETEROSEXUAL.
I'M NOT... NOT A GAY IN ME.
I JUST CAN'T STAND THE HATE, YOU KNOW?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOUR COMPANY SUCKS AND I DON'T BLOW DUDES SO, UP...
(LAUGHTER).
SO JUST... I THINK YOUR COMPANY SHOULD BE RESPECT, I DON'T (BLEEP) GUYS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING IS I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A TALK WITH THEM
ABOUT THEIR POLICY.
(LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, QUICK MESSAGE TO CHICK-FIL-A H.Q.: GIVE THIS WOMAN A RAISE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE'S A
