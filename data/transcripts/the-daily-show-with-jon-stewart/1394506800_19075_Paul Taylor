BOOMERS, MILLENNIALS, AND THELOOMING GENERATIONAL
SHOWDOWN. PLEASEWELCOME PAUL TAYLOR.
SIR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS BOOMERS,MILLENNIALS THE LOOMING
GENERATIONAL SHOWDOWN.
I GOTTA SAY, I DON'T THINK IT'SGONNA BE MUCH OF A SHOWDOWN.
I FEEL LIKE THE MILLENNIALS AREYOUNGER,
I THINK THEY ARE HEALTHIER.
THEY ARE PROBABLY STRONGER.
[ LAUGHTER ]I HAVE A FEELING THEY ARE GOING
TO BE VERY CAPABLE OF KICKINGOUR ASSES.
>> AND HERE IS THE OTHER THINGTHEY ARE STILL LIVING WITH MOM
AND DAD SO IT'S HARD TO MOUNT AGENERATION WAR FROM YOUR
CHILDHOOD BEDROOM. >> Jon: WOW.
THAT IS INTERESTING.
ARE THEY LIVING WITH THEIRPARENTS PURELY BECAUSE OF
ECONOMIC REASONS?
>> MOSTLY.
BUT THEY ALSO -- THEY CAN'T FINDJOBS BUT THEY ALSO LIKE MOM AND
DAD.
IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT.
Jon: THAT IS DIFFERENT.
THEY KIND OF HAVE GONE FROM KIDSTO ROOMMATES AND THEY SORT OF
WORK THINGS OUT.
IT'S A GOOD DEAL THEREFRIGERATOR IS STOCKED.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT COINS INTHE
WASHING MACHINE.
IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO HANG OUT INYOU CAN'T FIND A JOB.
AND A LOT OF THEM HAD TROUBLEFINDING A JOB.
>> Jon: WHAT IS, GIVE ME THESENSE OF THIS GENERATION.
THERE'S GENERATION XAND THEN I BLACKED OUT AND
THEN SOMETHING.
WHO ARE THE MILLENNIALS?
>> SO THEY'RE BORN AFTER 1980.
THE OLDEST OF THEM IS IN HIS ORHER EARLY 30s.
>> Jon: OKAY.
THEY HAVEN'T CROSSED A LOT OFWHAT HE WE WOULD CALL THE
TRADITIONAL MILESTONES OFADULTHOOD.
TODAY 20 SOMETHINGS ONLYONE-QUARTER OF THEM ARE MARRIED.
THEIR PARENTS GENERATION MORETHAN HALF WERE MARRIED.
WHY AREN'T THEY MARRIED?
A LOT OF THEM WANT TO GETMARRIED.
BUT THEY CAN'T FIND JOBS.
AND THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES I'MNOT A GOOD MARRIAGE PARTNER
HERE.
I CAN'T SUPPORT A FAMILY.
>> Jon: REALLY.
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE TINDEROR J-DATE?
THEY ARE SELF ASSESSING AS BEINGPOOR MARRIAGE MATERIAL AND NOT
THINKING OF THEMSELVES AS I CANJUST CLICK ON THAT PROFILE AND
LADEDADEDA.
>> IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OFBOTH.
THEY DON'T HAVE SPOUSES.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS.
SO THE TYPICAL MILLENNIAL IS ONFACEBOOK AND HE OR SHE HAS 250
FRIENDS.
THE PARENTS ARE STARTING TOCATCH UP AND IT'S ONE OF REASONS
WHY FACEBOOK MAYBE ISN'T PLACETO BE ANYMORE.
BUT THEY HAVE MANY MORE FRIENDSTHAN THEIR PARENTS.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THE PARENTS AREALSO GOING ON FACEBOOK?
>> YEAH, IT'S A PROBLEM.
>> Jon: IS THERE A GENERATIONBENEATH THE MILLENNIALS IS THERE
ANOTHER ONE.
>> IF YOU CAN NAME IT I'LL TAKEYOU OUT TO LUNCH.
USUALLY IT'S MAGAZINE COVERWRITERS WHO FIGURE THAT OUT.
>> Jon: YOU JUST OPENED UP ACONTEST, MY FRIEND.
>> TYPICALLY GENERATIONS LAST 20YEARS.
THE OLDEST IS 33.I'M THINKING THE
12-YEAR-OLD OUT THERE WILL BESOMETHING DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: 20 YEARS SEEMS LIKE ANINCREDIBLY BROAD SPECTRUM TOMAKE ANY
LARGER INFERENCES ABOUT AGENERATION ESPECIALLY NOW WHERE
THE SPEED OF TECHNOLOGY CHANGESSO QUICKLY AND MUTATES SO
QUICKLY.
>> YES AND NO.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE STORY OFMILLENNIALS ENDS.
THE BOOMERS, PEOPLE LIKE ME MADEA LOT OF NOISE IN OUR 20s.
WE'VE CHANGED AND OUR POLITICALVIEWS HAVE GOTTEN MORE
CONSERVATIVE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT THEMILLENNIALS SO FAR, THEY ARE A
VERY LIBERAL GROUP ON SOCIAL ANDPOLITICAL ISSUES.
THEY'VE VOTED IN TWO OR THREEELECTIONS.
THEY WERE A BIG PART OFPRESIDENT OBAMA'S VICTORIES.
THEY DON'T LIKE TO IDENTIFY.
THEY DON'T IDENTIFY -->> Jon: ISN'T THAT USUAL FOR
A YOUNGER GENERATION.I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE
YOUNGER GENERATION WASTRADITIONALLY MORE LIBERAL.
>> THE XER'S THE GENERATION ONEUP DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY.
THEY WERE CHILDREN OF REAGANREVOLUTION.
THEY WERE SOMEWHAT CYNICAL ABOUTGOVERNMENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
THEY WENT THEIR OWN WAY ANDSTARTED OUT CONSERVATIVE.
THIS GENERATION IS STARTING OUTLIBERAL.
>> Jon: THEY ARE MOVING.
ARE THEY MOVING AWAY FROM BEINGLIBERAL NOW AS THEY GET OLDER OR
IS THAT TRACKING STILL SOCIALLY?
>> LISTEN THEY ARE NOT AS HIGHON OBAMA AS THEY WERE FOUR AND
SIX YEARS AGO.
THAT HONEYMOON IS OVER.
BUT THEY FEEL BETTER ABOUT OBAMATHAN A LOT OF OLDER ADULTS DO.
THEY STILL BELIEVE INGOVERNMENT.
IT'S INTERESTING.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE INORGANIZATIONS.
THEY DON'T IDENTIFY ASDEMOCRATS.
YOU TALK ABOUT POPE FRANCIS.
THEY DON'T AFFILIATE WITHRELIGIONS.
>> Jon: BUT DON'T YOU THINK AGENTLEMAN LIKE POPE FRANCIS
COULD BRING THEM BACK IN GIVENTHE WAY HE HAS BROUGHT A NEW
MESSAGE TO THE CHURCH.
>> PUT HIM ON LATE NIGHT TV HEWILL BE TOUGH COMPETITION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING AND I SAY THIS WITHALL DUE RESPECT, I'M ALREADY UP
AGAINST SOMEONE INFALLIBLE ANDTHAT IS COLBERT.
I DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH ANY OFTHAT.
IN YOUR MIND, IS IT -- ITCHANGES BECAUSE THAT NATIVIST
STREAK OF AMERICANS IS SORT OFDISSIPATING NOW.
IS THAT THE BIGGEST SHIFT INTHESE GENERATIONAL?
>> WE'RE BECOMING A RAINBOWNATION.
IN 1960 THE POPULATION WAS 85%WHITE.
BY 2060 IT WILL BE 43% WHITE.
FRANKLY, THAT IS FREAKING OUT ALOT OF OLDER PEOPLE.
>> Jon: I HADN'T NOTICED THATOR SEEN THAT AT ALL.
[LAUGHTER]>> BUT AMONG THE MILLENNIALS WHO
ARE THAT, THEY ARE THE RAINBOW.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THEYUNDERSTAND LIKE ALL IMMIGRATION
IT'S THE NATURAL ORDER.
>> THAT'S WHO WE ARE BECOMINGAND THE MILLENNIALS ARE TOTALLY
COOL WITH IT.
>> Jon: I WONDER IF THEY'LLBUY EACH OTHER A COKE BECAUSE
THAT IS ULTIMATELY WHERE ITLEADS TO.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
THE COKE GENERATION?
>> ALL RIGHT.
I THINK YOU'LL GET A SPONSOR FORTHE SHOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THE NEXT AMERICA ON
THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
