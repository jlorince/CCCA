>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
YOU KNOW, FAR LONG TIME NOW, WEFOUND OUT OUR INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES HAVE SPIED ON US,TAPPING OUR PHONES, SEARCHING
OUR E-MAIL, WATCHING US WHILE WEBATHE.
YES, WHILE WE BATHE!
WELL, GUESS WHAT, IT'S PAYBACKTIME.
>> WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT TROUBLEAT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY.
>> THANKS TO THE FREEDOM OFINFORMATION ACT, WE NOW HAVE
ACCESS TO ALL KINDS OFINFORMATION THAT OTHERWISE WE
PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE SEENTHE LIGHT OF DAY.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.
THE SPIERS HAVE BECOME THESPY-EES.
C.I.A., THIS IS GOING TO BEJUICY.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT,GERMAN ESPIONAGE, POISONING THE
RUSSIANS?
WHAT DO WE GOT?
>> THE WEB SITE MUCKROCK FILEDAN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REQUEST
TO SEE THE C.I.A. STAFFERS'COMMENTS ABOUT THE LUNCHROOM IN
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: [BLEEPED].
YES, APPARENTLY CAFETERIACOMPLAINTS ARE WHAT WE FOUND
OUT.
APPARENTLY WHEN OUR INTELLIGENCEPROFESSIONALS AREN'T SENDING
DRONES AFTER TERRORISTS, THEY'RESENDING BITCHY E-MAILS ABOUT
THEIR LUNCH.
THE E-MAILS WERE EVERYTHING FROMPREFERRING INDIVIDUAL KETCHUP
PACKETS TO THE PUMP BOXES TOINADEQUATE ALMOND PORTIONS AT
THE BREAKFAST CEREAL BAR TO DIETPEPSI COMING OUT OF THE
REGULAR PEPSI SPOUT.
FASCINATING.
APPARENTLY AT THE C.I.A., EVENTHE SODAS GO UNDERCOVER AS OTHER
SODAS. ESPIONAGE.
NOW, WE ARE VERY FORTUNATETONIGHT.
WE HAVE A C.I.A. EMPLOYEE WHO ISREADY TO LEAK MORE INFORMATION
TO US ABOUT THIS SCANDAL.
OBVIOUSLY, ANYTHING REGARDINGTHIS C.I.A. HIGHLY SENSITIVE.
WE HAVE TAKEN GREAT PAINS TOCONCEAL HIS OR HER IDENTITY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING USTONIGHT, SIR OR MA'AM.
>> UH-HUH.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: IF YOU DON'T MIND,
COULD YOU READ US SOME MORE OFTHESE ACTUAL COMPLAINT E-MAILS
FROM THE C.I.A.
>> OKAY.
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW, I WASVERY AGGREVATED AT BUYING A
SUBWAY SANDWICH AND GOING BACKTO MY DESK TO EAT TO FIND THE
BREAD STALE AND CRUNCHY HARD.
I HAD TO EAT THE INSIDE ANDTHROW THE BREAD OUT.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
OBVIOUSLY WE APPRECIATE YOUTAKING THIS RISK, SIR.
ARE YOU SURE WE'RE DOING ENOUGHTO CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY,
BECAUSE THIS IS...
>> WHAT?
MY FACE IS HIDDEN.
SILHOUETTE.
I COULD BE ANYBODY.
WHERE WAS I?
NOW, WHY DOESN'T THE BURGER KINGFACILITY HERE OFFER THE SAME
DOLLAR MENU AS THE OUTSIDEFACILITIES?
WHY CAN'T THERE BE NICER FOODHANDLERS?
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE DEAL WITHTHAT?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: NO, NOW ALRIGHT. NOT TO,
NOT TO HARP ON THIS POINT.
I AM CONCERNED, SIR.
YOUR VOICE IS SOMEWHATDISTINCTIVE, AND THAT LAST PART
THAT YOU JUST SAID SOUNDED A BITLIKE A CATCHPHRASE.
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WAS IN THEE-MAIL.
>> DISTINCTIVE, NO, NORMALVOICE.
YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY SOMEONE JUSTBY THEIR VOICE.
WHY DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU CALLSOMEONE, YOU SAY HI, IT'S SO AND
SO.
OTHERWISE THEY'D HAVE NO IDEAWHO THEY WERE TALKING TO.
THE WORST IS WHEN SOMEONE CALLSAND SAY, "HEY, IT'S ME.
WHO'S ME?
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE NAMED ME.
I'M ME. YOU'RE SOMEBODY ELSE."
>> Jon: NO, SEE THAT? THIS ALLSOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE,
I DON'T --
>> NOT NOW!
>> GIDDY-UP.
>> Jon: LOOK I THINK I, I, SIR,YOUR COVER IS...
I THINK WE MAY HAVE SLIGHTLYCOMPROMISED YOUR COVER, SIR.
>> WHAT COVER? I'M COVERED.
COVER YOURSELF.
THE JAZZ SALAD WAS SUPPOSED TOBE A SONOMA GRAPE AND PROSCIUTTO
SALAD, SO I STAND IN LINE ANDNOTICE THERE ARE NO GRAPES.
GRAPES ARE IN THE TITLE OF THESALAD.
>> Jon: LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHATA JAZZ SALAD IS.
>> IT'S LIKE A REGULAR SALAD BUTJAZZIER.
HOW MUCH CLEARER COULD THAT BE?
>> Jon: I THINK YOU'RE IN ALOT OF DANGER RIGHT NOW.
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHO IS INDANGER, THESE PEOPLE EATING
NOTHING BUT BURGER KING, SUBWAYAND SALADS FILLED WITH JAZZ.
I MEAN, WHO ARE...
>> Jon: THESE PEOPLE?
>> YES.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOFTERSUBWAY BREAD.
THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR ATREADMILL.
THEIR SPIES.
IF INCONSPICUOUS IS WHAT YOU'REGOING FOR, MAYBE WHEEZING IS NOT
THE BEST TACTIC.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK WE'REOUT OF TIME.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMINGBY, SIR.
AND, I KNOW YOU PUT YOURSELF INTREMENDOUS DANGER TO DO THIS.
AND IT'S THE TYPE OF THINGTHAT...
>> SHOULD I STAY BEHIND THETHING?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I DON'T THINK IT
MATTERS ANYMORE.
JUST GO.
I'LL BRING YOU OUT DURING THEGUEST SEGMENT.
