RUSSIAN ATTITUDES TOWARDS GAYPEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF
MUCH CONTROVERSY DURING THESOCHI GAMES.
FOR A FIRSTHAND LOOK WE REJOINJASON JONES LIVE FROM SOCHI-ISH.
[ LAUGHTER ]THE WINTER OLYMPICS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN THE GAYER OF THE TWOOLYMPICS BUT HOW WILL THAT PLAYIN RUSSIA
A COUNTRY THAT RECEIVED A LOT OFCRITICISM FOR THE STRICT
ANTI-GAY LAWS.
I SAT WITH SERGE MARKOFF APOLITICAL ANALYST TO SEE HOW A
RUSSIAN POLITICAL SPIN DOCTORWOULD HANDLE THIS.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT GAY RIGHTSOR AS YOU CALL THEM IN RUSSIA,
WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE OF THATIS.
>> I I AM TIRED FROM THIS ISSUE.
>> Jon: YOU ARE TIRED OFTALKING ABOUT GAYS?
>> IT'S BORING FROM MY POINT OFVIEW.
>>>> BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS FOR
GAYS WHO CARES.
>> NOBODY CARES IN RUSSIA.
YOU ARE FREE TO MAKE SEX WITHTHIS TABLE.
GO AHEAD.
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW RIGHT NOWWE CAN DO IT.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO (bleep).
>> MANY TIMES REPEAT ME IT'SNORMAL IT'S A FREEDOM, IT'S
DEMOCRACY, IT'S HUMAN RIGHTS FORTO YOU MAKING SEX WITH THIS
TABLE.
>> IT'S A FALSE ANALOGY.
>> HAVING SEX BETWEEN MAN ANDWOMAN NORMAL.
HAVING SEX BETWEEN MAN AND MANNOT NORMAL, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
INCLUDING GAYS.
>> AFTER LISTENING TO THIS NUTJOB I ONLY HAD ONE THOUGHT, BOY
DO I OWE RICK SANTORUM ANAPOLOGY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE
HAS SAID EVERY HOMOPHOBIC THINGIMAGINABLE HE'S NEVER HADTHE GALL TO SAY GAY
PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM. BUTSERGEI IS NO BIGOT. HE JUSTWANTS TO SPREAD THE TRUTH.
>> ONE PEOPLE THINK IT'S NORMALGAY SEX AND OTHER PEOPLE SAY LET
IT SEE IT IN THE FACE OF GOD.
AND OTHER PEOPLE SAY THIS IS ASICKNESS.
>> I HAVE A SOLUTION:  WHY DON'TWE HAVE A GAY PRIDE PARADE
FOLLOWED BY A HOMOPHOBIC PARADEFOLLOWED BY A (bleep) IDIOT
PARADE THEN THE KIDS CAN SEE ALLTHREE VIEWPOINTS.
>> IT'S ONE OF POSSIBILITIES.
>> Jon: OKAY.
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
AN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT TRIESTO EXCUSE THE HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS AND THEN WE HIT THESTREETS AND FIND THAT THE PEOPLEARE
FULL OF COMPASSION, RIGHTAVERAGE RUSSIANS.
>> I TOTALLY SUPPORT PRESIDENTPUTIN BECAUSE I'M FOR
TRADITIONAL FAMILIES AND THE ITHINK IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.
>> YOU AGREE WITH THE LAW?
>> I'M MORE
THAN 100% AGAINSTGAYS.
>> YOU ARE A MUSICIAN AND YOUDON'T RESPECT THEM?
>> THERE'S A LOT OF GAY PEOPLEON STAGE BUT NONE OF THEM IN THE
ORCHESTRA.
NO GAYS IN THE ORCHESTRA?
[LAUGHTER]THERE ARE.
THAT WAS JUST CRAZY OLD RUSSIANSWITH DEAD ANIMALS ON THEIR HEAD.
WHAT ABOUT THE POLITCALLY ACTIVEYOUTH.
>> I'M AGAINST GAY PEOPLEBECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE SHAME
OF MY COUNTRY.
>> HOLY (bleep) THESE PEOPLEHAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS
RUSSIA SHOULD BEASHAMED OF LIKE THE 74% OF
RUSSIANS WHO DON'T THINKHOMOSEXUALITY SHOULD BE ACCEPTED
IN SOCIETY WHICH LEADS TOBACKWARDS THINKING LIKE THIS.
>> I CAN ONLY IMAGINE TAKING MYKIDS TO EXPLAIN SEEING A MAN
TAKING A KID TO SCHOOL ANDEXPLAINING WHAT IS GOING ON
HERE.
>> IT'S TOUGH TO EXPLAIN THATTHAT KID HAS TWO DADDIES.
>> I CANNOT FIND THE WORDS.
THE WORDS I JUST USED.
>> I CANNOT FIND THE WORDS.
>> REPEAT WHAT I SAID, HEY, THATKID HAS TWO DADDIES.
>> NO WAY.
>> YOU CAN'T SAY THAT?
THIS COUNTRY WAS STUCK IN THEDARK AGES OR AS WE CALL IT IN
AMERICA 40 YEARS AGO.
AFTER ALL THIS HOMOPHOBIA THEREWAS ONLY ONE THNG I WANTED TO DO
SIT WITH A GROUP OF YOUNG GAYMUSCOVITES AND ASK THEM
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO AMERICA?
>> I'VE BEEN TO IT I DIDN'T LIKEIT.
>>WHAT IS IT, THE COLD YOU MISS?YOU CAN GO TO MINNEAPOLIS. IT'SCOLD AS (bleep) THERE.
>> I'M A RUSSIAN FIRST.
>> THAT'S FINE, NOBODY ISAMERICAN FIRST.
>> RUSSIAN PEOPLE DON'T KNOWABOUT GAY PEOPLE A LOT.
>> PROBLEM WITH THE LAW IT'S ASTEP BACK.
IF YOU WANT TO REACH THEULTIMATE GOAL YOU HAVE TO KIND
OF OVERCOME THIS STEP BACK ANDFIGHT FROM THERE.
>> THESE BRAVE MEN ARE STILLWILLING TO STAY AND FIX THEIR
COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UPAGAINST THIS IDIOCY.
>> NO GAY PROPAGANDA TOCHILDREN.
>> WHY?
>> IT'S DANGEROUS.
>> IT'S DANGEROUS FOR GAYS TOWALK BY HOLDING HANDS IN FRONT
OF KIDS?
WHO CARES.
>> I CARE.
>> I'M A PARENT.
I DON'T CARE.
>> SOMETIMES YOU WILL CARE ANDYOU WILL SAY TO ME SERGEI HE WAS
RIGHT.
>> I DON'T HAVE A LOT OFCERTAINTIES IN LIFE, BUT THE ONE
ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY I HAVE IS IWILL NEVER SAY
SERGEI YOU ARERIGHT.
AS I TRIED TO WASH THE BAD TASTEOUT OF MY MOUTH I REMEMBERED THEONE
WOMAN I MET PROTESTING THE LAWS.
>> ARE YOU HOPEFUL THAT RUSSIACAN CHANGE?
>> I HAVE TO HOPE BECAUSEOTHERWISE IT'S TOO DEPRESSING.
>> IT IS REALLY (bleep)DEPRESSING.
>> I REALLY DO IT JUST TO NOT BEASHAMED OF ME -- OF MY WAY OF
LIVING.
I WANT TO LOOK IN THE EYES OF MYCHILDREN AND MY GRANDCHILDREN
AND SAY THAT I DID ALL I COULD.
I ALSO QUOTE FROM AN AMERICAN TVSHOW IT'S CALLED "ANGEL" THERE'S
A WONDERFUL PHRASE THERE, IFNOTHING WE DO MATTERS THAN ALL
THAT MATTERS IS WHAT WE DID.
>> NOTHING WE DO MATTERS ALLTHAT MATTERS IS WHAT WE DO.
IT SOUNDS SO MUCH BETTER COMINGOUT OF YOUR MOUTH THAN ANGEL.
THIS ONE IS OF THOSE POINTSWHERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY IRONY I
JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG.
THAT GOOD?
ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: JASON JONES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
