I'M IN.
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT DO?
>> WHEN IT ALL WENT DOWN IN
BENGHAZI, THE ADMINISTRATION
FACING THE ELECTION WENT INTO
PANIC MODE, WANTED TO CONTAIN
IT, DON'T SEND IN THE MILITARY.
DON'T BLOW THIS INTO A BIGGER
THING THAN IT'S GOING TO BE.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S
CASE WAS COWARDLY, DUPLICITOUS
AND THEY SACRIFICED AMERICAN
LIVES FOR POLITICS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY
OUTRAGE JUSTIFIED.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES TO CONSCIOUSLY ALLOW
AMERICANS TO DIE TO PROTECT HIS
OWN POLITICAL CHANCES IS DAMNING
DAMNING.
YOUR LEVEL OF ANGER IS IN FACT
JUSTIFIED.
AS IS THE QUESTION YOU'VE BEEN
ASKING NOW FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
>> WHERE IS THE MEDIA OUTRAGE ON
LIBYA AND BENGHAZI?
>> WHY IS THIS STORY NOT GETTING
MORE COVERAGE IN THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA.
>> WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE.
Jon: YES!
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?
OVER OBAMA'S COVER-UP.
WHICH WE KNOW IS INDEED THE
CASE.
>> THAT INDEED WAS THE CASE.
Jon: THAT INDEED WAS THE
CASE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
IF THAT INDEED IS THE CASE, SEE,
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.
THIS DEFINITELY HAPPENED, NOT IF
THAT INDEED WAS THE CASE.
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE MAY NOT BE
OUTRAGED BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE
SAYING YOU'RE NOT SURE YET.
>> WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT LIED
ABOUT BENGHAZI AND WHAT IF, IN
FACT, HE KNEW ABOUT THIS MUCH
EARLIER?
>> WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT
THEIR LIVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SAVED?
>> WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT
BENGHAZI WAS A DEATH TRAP.
>> IF THERE HAS INDEED BEEN A
COVER UP.
>> IF HE DID NOTHING.
HE LIED ABOUT IT.
IF HE LIED ABOUT IT.
THAT'S THE CASE, JON,
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
>> THAT IS THE SHAME OF AMERICA.
E CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT INCLUDING
POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT IF HE LIED.
>> Jon: YES.
IF.
AND IF DINGLE BERRIES WERE
DIAMONDS I COULD OPEN A JAY
JEWELERS IN MY PANTS.
IF.
IF.
I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM HERE.
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
EVERYONE ELSE ISN'T AS OUTRAGED
AS YOU WHEN IT'S BECAUSE THE
REST OF US AREN'T SURE IF WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE.
AND TO BE QUITE FRANK, YOU DO
HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A HISTORY OF...
NOT THAT YOU NECESSARILY BLOWN
THINGS OUT OF PROPORTION WITH
THIS PRESIDENT OR CREATED HIGHLY
EMOTIONAL NARRATIVES CONCERNING
THIS PRESIDENT.
I DO REMEMBER THIS SALUTE
HAIRING ON HANNITY JUST 100 DAYS
INTO HIS PRESIDENCY.
>> SO HELP YOU GOD.
ME GOD.
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK A STIMULUS
IS?
>> I WANT HIM TO FAIL.
EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA ADMITS
AMERICA'S ARROGANCE.
>> THIS PRESIDENT VOW BOWED
BEFORE THE SAUDI KING.
>> GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
>> Jon: THREE MONTHS IN, YOU HAD
HIM AS DAMIAN IN THE OMEN.
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
BUT WOLF HAS BEEN CRIED BEFORE.
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS OF INTENSIVE
INVESTIGATION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO BETTER STATE YOUR CASE THAN
THIS FROM YESTERDAY.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'VE
DESCRIBED, IT SOUNDS LIKE
THERE'S BEEN A COVER-UP BUT WHAT
WERE THEY TRYING TO COVER UP?
>> WELL, AGAIN, THIS IS WHY
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE TRUTH.
>> NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE COME
OUT IF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE,
IF DARRELL ISSA IF OUR COMMITTEE
DIDN'T CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE NO [BLEEP]
IDEA.
IF WHAT HE'S SAYING IS TRUE...
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION,
IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE,
IF THE PRESIDENT LET AMERICANS
DIE FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEN
BY GOD, BRING US THE EVIDENCE
AND WE WILL GRAB THE PITCH FORKS
AND TORCHES ALONG WITH YOU.
BUT REMEMBER THAT GAME GOES BOTH
WAYS.
LET ME TRY.
IN 2011 THE STATE DEPARTMENT
REQUESTED FUNDING FOR WORLDWIDE
SECURITY PROTECTION AND UPGRADES
MONEY THAT COULD PERHAPS HAVE
GONE TO PROTECT BENGHAZI.
THE REPUBLICANS LIKE DARRELL
ISSA WHO IS HEADING UP THIS
COMMITTEE VOTED TO CUT THAT
FUNDING.
MAYBE BECAUSE OF POLITICAL
REASONS IN AN ELECTION YEAR TO
MAKE THE PRESIDENT LOOK WEAK.
THUS SACRIFICING AMERICANS FOR
POLITICAL GAIN.
DID THAT HAPPEN?
>> IF THAT'S THE CASE, JOHN,
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
