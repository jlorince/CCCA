SO WHY WOULD CONSERVATIVES, WHY WOULD CONSERVATIVES FEEL SO STRONGLY THAT SESAME STREET HAS TO GO?
I'M KIND OF GETTING THE SENSE THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE
>> I THOUGHT SESAME STREET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SHARING AND BEING NICE TO PEOPLE.
OVER THE YEARS THEY'VE GOTTEN MORE LIBERAL
>> BRAIN WASHING IN THE MOST OBVIOUS FORM.
>> PBS, SESAME STREET, PUBLIC TELEVISION SUCKAL AT THE PUBLIC TEATS FOR TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
IT'S AN INSIDIOUS FORM OF BRAIN WASHING AND PROPAGANDA BEING AS USUAL PERPETRATED BY THE LOFTY LEFT
>> Jon: I SEE.
SO FOX NEWS IS UPSET THAT EMPTY-HEADED PUPPETS ARE TRYING TO BRAIN WASH AND INDOCTRINATE AMERICANS.
WELL, PERHAPS...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ... I CAN TELL YOU... PERHAPS YOU COULD SUE THEM.
THE CHARGE COULD BE COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT FAIR.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU A SHOCKING CLIP OF SESAME STREET.
IF YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN, CHANCES ARE THEY'RE ASLEEP RIGHT NOW.
I WANT YOU TO WAKE THEM, DRAG THEM DISORIENTED INTO THE ROOM AND SHAKE THEM AND SAY, "DON'T LOOK AT THE TV."
THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.
THEN PUT THEM BACK TO BED.
I'LL WAIT.
NO, JUST RUN THE CLIP.
>> WOULD YOU SHARE YOUR FOOD WITH SOMEONE?
>> YES.
OU WOULD?
WHY?
>> BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD I'LL GIVE IT TO THEM
>> IF THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY FOOD, YOU WOULD GIVE... YOU WOULD GIVE THEM SOME?
>> UM-HUM OH, THAT IS VERY NICE OF YOU.
[BLEEP]
>> Jon: HOW DARE YOU?
HOW DARE YOU?
I'M SURE THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU  YOU, GROVER.
YOUR HEART IS AS RED AS THEY COME.
WE GO TO JOHN OLIVER AND WYATT CENAC IN OUR REGULAR ISSUE SEGMENT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: JOHN, WYATT?
HOW DOES SESAME STREET MAKE ITSELF MORE PALATABLE TO CONSERVATIVES?
>> IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK.
THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
FIRST, THERE'S THE NAME.
SESAME STREET.
>> Jon: YES GOT AN AWFUL MIDDLE EASTERN CONNOTATION TO IT.
>> Jon: AND YOU WOULD SUGGEST?
WELL, PATRIOT STREET.
â™ª CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET TO PATRIOT STREET?"
>> THROUGH FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.
THAT'S HOW.
>> YES, YES, YES.
NUMBER TWO, JON, SPONSORS.
THEY NEED TO UNLEASH THE POWER OF THE FREE MARKET.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
PATRIOT STREET IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE NUMBER MILLER BEER AND THE LETTER GOLD.
>> Jon: REALLY?
BEER?
>> AND OTHER TRADITIONAL AMERICAN VALUES LIKE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
>> EXACTLY.
IF PEOPLE ARE GUNNING FOR BIG BIRD
>> THEN BIG BIRD HAS THE RIGHT TO GUN BACK.
( APPLAUSE )
>> IT'S TRUE.
IME TO CLEAR UP SOME OF THOSE VICIOUS RUMORS BY FINALLY MEETING MRS. BIRD AND MRS. ERNIE.
>> IT SEEMS VERY DRASTIC.
JON, THEY'RE INDOCTRINATING OUR KIDS, JON.
>> OUR KIDS!
Jon: PATRIOT STREET WOULDN'T TEACH KIDS TO SHARE?
>> IT WOULD SIMPLY PUT THAT SHARING IN CONTEXT.
WOULD YOU SHARE YOUR FOOD WITH SOMEONE?
>> YES.
BUT THAT WOULD CREATE A CULTURE OF DEPENDENCY
>> IF I HAVE MY FOOD I'LL GIVE IT TO THEM
>> YOU'RE TAKING AWAY THE MOTIVATION TO EARN THAT FOOD FOR THEMSELVES
>> UM-HUM DID YOU NOT READ THAT COPY OF ATLAS SHRUGGED I LOANED YOU?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> AFTER THE GROUCH HAS BEEN MOOCHING FOR TOO LONG.
>> YEP.
HE NEEDS TO PULL HIMSELF UP BY HIS OWN BOOT STRAPS.
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK OSCAR THE GROUCH HAS FEET.
>> OH, MY GOD.
NONE OF US HAVE FEET.
(SCREAMING)
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
