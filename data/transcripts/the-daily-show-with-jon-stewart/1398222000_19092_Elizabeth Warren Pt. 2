>> ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE BACK,WE'RE TALKING WITH SENATOR
ELIZABETH WARREN.
HERE IS WHERE I THINK IT GETSINTERESTING.
SO THE IDEAL IS FAIRNESS.IDEOLOGICALLY, AT LEAST
PRINCIPLED CONSISTENCY, BUT YOUALSO HAVE CONSTITUENT
PRESSURE THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED.YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE BATTLE
YOU'RE FIGHTING, SO
LET'S SAY IT'S THE MEDICALDEVICE TAX FOR OBAMACARE.
THEY HAVE THIS IN PLACE, IT'S A2 TO 3% TAX ON MEDICAL DEVICES
TO HELP PAY FOR OBAMACARE.
NOW, YOU ARE FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
>> I AM.
>> THEY ARE THE SECOND LARGESTSELLER OF THESE MEDICAL DEVICES.
>> UH-HUH.
>> SO YOU VOTED AGAINST TAKINGTHAT TAX OUT.
THAT SEEMS ANTITHETICAL TO WHATI WOULD THINK YOU WOULD STAND
FOR, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THATCONSTITUENCY.
>> SO LOOK, THE QUESTION ON THEMEDICAL DEVICE TAX FOR ME,
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT'S AGOOD IDEA TO TAX MANUFACTURING
EXTRA OF ANY KIND BECAUSE ITHINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS
PRODUCE MORE MANUFACTURING JOBSIN THIS
COUNTRY. BUT IFWE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT
OUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND ANOTHERPLACE TO PAY
FOR IT, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS TOKEEP THE BUDGET GOING.
YOU'VE HIT ON A KEY PART ABOUTHOW WASHINGTON WORKS RIGHT NOW,
WHEN WASHINGTON ACTUALLYWORKS AND WHEN IT DOESN'T.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE POINTIF WE CAN FOR JUST A SECOND
ABOUT COLLEGE BECAUSE IT SHOWSTHIS SO WELL.
>> YEAH YEAH YEAH.
>> BUT WE CAN DO IT AROUND ANYPART OF THIS.
WHEN I GREW UP MY MOM WORKED AMINIMUM WAGE JOB AT SEARS.
MY DAD SOLD CARPETS ENDED UP ASA MAINTENANCE MAN.
>> RIGHT.
>> I MADE IT TO THE UNITEDSTATES SENATE AND A BIG PART OF
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT IWENT TO A COMMUTER COLLEGE THAT
COST $50 A SEMESTER.
AND I WENT TO A COLLEGE THATCOST $50 A SEMESTER AND GOT A
GOOD EDUCATION BECAUSE I GREW UPIN AN AMERICA THAT SAID OUR JOB
IS TO INVEST IN OUR KIDS.
AND TO HELP THEM BUILD A FUTURE.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLYCHANGED.
IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE, IT REALLYIS A RIGGED GAME.
AND IT'S SET UP NOW OVER ANDOVER AND OVER AGAIN.
>> AND IT'S PROBABLY ALWAYSBEEN.
>> WELL, NOT LIKE THIS.
>> RIGHT.
>> IT'S SET UP OVER AND OVER ANDOVER THAT THE RICH GET RICHER
AND THE POWERFUL MOREPOWERFUL. THEY'VE GOT ALL THE
ADVANTAGES OF CONCENTRATED MONEYAND CONCENTRATED POWER.
ALL WE GOT ON THE OTHER SIDE ISWE'VE GOT OUR VOICES AROUND WE
GET OUR VOTES.
IF WE GET OUT THERE AROUND MAKESOMETHING OUT OF THEM.
[APPLAUSE]>> I TELL YOU, GOOD ON YOU
FOR BELIEVING IT AND GETTINGINTO THE FIGHT AND DOING WHAT
YOU CAN WITHIN THAT AND DEALINGWITH OBVIOUSLY ALL THE
DIFFERENT COMPLICATIONS THATOCCUR WITH IT.
A FIGHTING CHANCE -- DID YOU DOTHE AUDIO BOOK?
>> I DID IT ALL.
IT'S ME.
>> REALLY YOU DID THE READING?
>> I DID. I WROTE THAT BOOK ANDI READ THE AUDIO.
>> WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN GOOD TOHAVE WILLFORD BRIMLEY IN THERE?
A LITTLE WILLFORD BRIMLEY INTHERE?
>> A LITTLE BIT WOULD HAVE BEENNICE.
>> YOU KNOW A FIGHTING CHANCE ISALL YOU NEED.
>> I'M GOING TO GET IN ANDLISTEN TO IT IN MY CAR THAT I
KEEP INSIDE MY PRIVATE PLANE.
"A FIGHTING CHANCE", IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
