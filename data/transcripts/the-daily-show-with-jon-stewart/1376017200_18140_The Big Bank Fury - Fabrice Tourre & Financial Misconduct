DOG LIKES HIM.
BESIDES, I'VE JUST GIVEN UP.
THE SETTLEMENT TERMS FOR
THESE BANKERS ARE PRETTY
ATTRACTIVE.
IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT
NO ONE WANTS TO HAVE THEIR
DAY IN COURT.
WELL, ALMOST NO ONE.
>> A JURY HAS DECIDED THAT A
FORMER WALL STREET TRADER
SHOULD PAY FOR HIS ROLE IN
THE TOXIC MORTGAGE CRISIS
THAT WAS AS MUCH A BIG PART
OF THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN.
HE IS FABRICE, A 34 YEAR OLD
FRENCH BORN FORMER GOLDMAN
SACHS TRADER.
>> HE CALLS HIMSELF FABULOUS
FAB.
>> WHAT?
>> FABULOUS FAB, LIKE ARE
YOU IN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.
AND I DO HOPE YOU CHECKED
THE DRAG QUEEN REGISTRATION
WEB SITE TO SEE IF THAT NAME
WAS EVEN AVAILABLE AT THE
MOMENT.
AND FRANKLY, I DID NOT KNOW
THAT YOU WERE EVEN ALLOWED
TO PICK YOUR OWN NICK NAME.
NO ONE TOLD ME THAT WAS AN
OPTION.
SO WITH THAT IN MIND FROM
NOW ON YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS
JUG MASTER JOHNNY FRESH.
YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> OKAY ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW
WHAT, THAT'S A BIT OF A
MOUTHFUL.
LET'S GO WITH JUICY JOHNNIE,
NO, I TAKE THAT BACK, THAT'S
TOO SEXY.
I'VE GOT IT CARLOS DANGER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> DANGER.
>> NO, THAT NAME IS
AVAILABLE, HE'S PROMISED
HE'S NOT USING IT ANY MORE.
STILL, I GUESS AT LEAST WE
HAVE ONE GUY, AND HE'S A
VICE PRESIDENT, SO EVEN IF
HE DIDN'T TAKE DOWN THE
COMPANY WE GOT THE NUMBER
TWO.
WHAT?
GOLDMAN SACHS VICE PRESIDENT,
BY THE WAY THEY'VE GOT ABOUT
12,000 OF THEM OVER THERE --
>> HOLY [BLEEP], 12,000 VICE
PRESIDENTS?
ALL PRESUMABLY WITH
DIFFERENT RIDICULOUS NICK
NAMES.
APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T WALK
INTO GOLDMAN AND THROW A PEN
WITHOUT HITTING A VICE
PRESIDENT.
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HIT THE
JANITOR YOU WILL BE HITTING
THE VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE
OF URINAL CAKE OR AS HE
INSISTS ON BEING CALLED
SCRUBTASTIC STEVE.
BUT AT LEAST FABULOUS
FABRICE IS GOING TO JAIL,
RIGHT?
>> A JURY FOUND FORMER
GOLDMAN TRADER FABRICE
LIABLE ON SIX AND SEVEN.
CIVIL COUNTS FOR FRAUD THE
AND A POTENTIAL IS LIFE BAN
FROM THE SECURITIES
INDUSTRY.
>> A LIFETIME BAN FROM THE
SECURITIES INDUSTRY,
SHOULDN'T HE AT LEAST HAVE
TO STAY A THOUSAND FEET AWAY
FROM WALL STREET?
AND INTRODUCE HIMSELF
DOOR-TO-DOOR WHENEVER HE
MOVES TO ANY TOWN THAT HAS A
BANK?
JUST-- HELLO, MY NAME IS
FABRICE AND I'M A REGISTERED
DERIVATIVES OFFENDER.
(APPLAUSE)
>> LOOK, I GUESS IF IT'S
JUST THE BEST WE CAN HOPE
FOR, FINES THAT ARE
ESSENTIALLY ROLL MOOD THE
BANK'S COST OF DOING
BUSINESS ALONG WITH THEIR
BUDGET FOR TONNER CARTRIDGES
OR COCAINE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AT LEAST NOW THEY KNOW
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE
WATCHING THEM AND IT WILL BE
AWHILE BEFORE THEY DARE TO
BEHAVE SO BADLY AGAIN.
>> BANKS ARE BEHAVING BADLY
AGAIN.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A LETTER
FROM THE NEW YORK STATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
LAST YEAR FIVE BANKS AGREED
TO PAY OUT $25 BILLION AS
PART OF A SETTLEMENT
DESIGNED TO PUT A STOP TO
MORTGAGE AND FORECLOSURE
ABUSE.
SCHNEIDERMAN SAYS SOME OF
THE BANKS ARE QUOTE ENGAGING
IN MUCH OF THE SAME
MISCONDUCT THAT PRECIPITATED
THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE
SETTLEMENTS.
>> AND WE'RE BACK TO WHERE
WE STARTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE PERFECT
ANALOGY FOR THIS IS?
OUR FINANCIAL REGULATORY
SYSTEM IS LIKE 50 SHADES OF
GREY.
YOU CAN'T HURT THEM BECAUSE
THEY LIKE IT.
AND WE JUST KEEP GETTING
