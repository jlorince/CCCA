PRICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T SAY I AGREE WITH RAND PAUL ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT AS ISSUES GO DRONE OVERSIGHT IS ONE WORTH
KICKING UP DUST FOR.
THEY ARE PREVENGT THE SENATE ON GETTING ANYTHING DONE ON JOHN BRENNAN'S CONFIRMATION
IT'S REALLY JUST A REASON TO NOT GET ANYTHING DONE ON THE SEQUESTER WHERE YOU RARELY
SEE THINGS GOING ON SO RARELY OUTSIDE OF A NASCAR RACE.
LAUGH LAT THE SEQUESTER SAY BATTLE OVER GOVERNMENT FUNDING PRIORITIES TO.
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FAR APART THE TWO PARTIES ARE WE NEED ONLY LOOK TO THE
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
>> I PROPOSE WORKING WITH STATES TO MAKE HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL AVAILABLE TO EVERY
SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HA-ZAAA!
HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD.
MARRIED CHILDREN, OF COURSE, TOO BUSY RAISING THEIR OWN FAMILIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL.
SEEMS LIKE THE SORT OF THING THAT IS GOING TO GO OVER PRETTY GOOD.
>> I HAD AN E-MAIL FROM A TEACHER AS THEY WERE GIVING THE SPEECH, SOMEONE I'VE
KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.
IT WAS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
MORE PAPERWORK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: AND WHAT DO THE TEACHERS GET FOR THE PAPERWORK?
JUST A BUNCH OF MONEY AND RESOURCES TO TEACH CHILDREN.
I MEAN, I HARDLY THINK THAT'S WHY MY FRIEND GOT INTO EDUCATION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT BESIDES REPRESENTATIVE BLACK BURN TOTALLY NOT MADE UP INTERNET TEACHER FRIEND
TEUP THERE MUST BE OTHER REASONS NOT TO FUND THIS PLAN.
>> THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STUDY SHOWS.
>> NO RESULTS.
>> YOU SEE A FEW GAINS IN THE PRESCHOOL YEARS, GONE BY FIRST GRADE.
>> I HAVE READ THAT PRESCHOOL IS NOT EFFECTIVE AFTER THE THIRD GRADE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE FOURTH GRADE.
NOT BACK TO PRESCHOOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THOSE HEAD START SKEPTICS REFERRING TO A PIECE OF 2012 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
DEPARTMENT STUDY THAT SHOWED KIDS WHO WENT TO HEAD START DID BETTER THAN THOSE WHO
DIDN'T HAVE THE PROGRAM BY THIRD GRADE RESULTS EVENED OUT.
WHICH MIGHT LEAVE A NORMAL PERSON TO SAY WHY NOT TAKE THE BENEFICIAL HEAD START
TECHNIQUES AND APPLY THEM TO THE THIRD GRADE AS OPPOSED TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THE
BENEFITS ONLY LAST A FEW YEARS SO -- IF WE'RE GOING WITH STUDIES YOU COULD KEEP
READING THE SAME REPORT YOU ARE QUOTING FROM AND SHOW THAT OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IN GENERAL HEAD START
PROGRAMS INCREASE GRADUATION RATES, LOWER CRIME RATES, INCREASED ATTENDANCE IN COLLEGE AND INCREASED --
DECREASED MORTALITY RATES.
WHAT WANTS TO GO TO 29 ANYWAY.
AM I RIGHT TWEENS?
MAYBE IT'S NOT EFFECTIVENESS CONCERNING THEM.
>> WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT.
>> HOW MUCH OF HANDOUT IS GOING TO COST YOU MONEY?
>> IT WOULD COST $10,000 PER KID PER YEAR THANK $300,000 PER CLASSROOM.
THIS JUST CRAZY TALK.
>> Jon: MONEY ON CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, ARE YOU MENTAL?
[LAUGHTER]
IF THESE CHILDREN WANT AN EDUCATION THEY SHOULD GET JOBS AND PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES.
THAT'S ILLEGAL, THANKS NANNY STATE.
THE CATEGORY IS THINGS WORTH INVESTING IN AMERICA'S FUTURE FOR.
PRESCHOOL, NO.
ANY OTHER IDEAS?
>> WE KNOW CHINA IS LOOKING INTO INVEST IN THE MILITARY.
CERTAINLY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA HAS CHANGED BUT THEY ARE -- WE NEED TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG MILITARY.
>> Jon: WE HAVE A STRONG MILITARY.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE BY A MILE.
WE SPEND MORE ON DEFENSE THAN THE NEXT 12 COUNTRIES COMBINED INCLUDING CHINA INCLUDING RUSSIA.
WE'RE LIKE THE LADY ON JERRY SPRINGER WHO CAN'T STOP GETTING BREAST IMPLANTS.
THE TRUTH IS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THE TRUTH IS CHINA'S BUDGET -- CHINA'S MILITARY BUDGET WOULD BE A FINE SIZE FOR OUR FIGURE BUT WE'RE NOT
SATISFIED UNTIL IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO SHOPLIFT SOCCER BALLS.
>> Jon: YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT LITERACY MATH AND GRADUATION RATES.
DON'T CARE?
YOU SHOULD.
BECAUSE THOSE NEW EXPENSIVE WEAPONS SYSTEMS ARE PRETTY COMPLICATED.
>> A GROUP OF RETIRED GENERALS AND ADMIRALS SAY THAT THE STATE OF AMERICA'S
YOUTH IS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY.
IT CLAIMS THAT THREE OUT OF OUR AMERICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 17 AND 24 COULDN'T
JOIN THE MILITARY IF THEY WANTED TO BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, HAVE CRIMINAL
RECORDS OR ARE PHYSICALLY UNFIT.
THEY ARE PUSHING FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT.
>> Jon: WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE?
EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT?
AH-HA.
I GOT IT.
PERHAPS COMBINING THE TWO IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET MORE MONEY FOR EDUCATION.
I GIVE YOU SEAL TEAM ACTUALLY 6.
I WANT TO GET BIN WADIN BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO STAY UP PAST
