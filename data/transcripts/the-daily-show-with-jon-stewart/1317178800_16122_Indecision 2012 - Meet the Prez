>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MANY I NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, SETH ROGAN.
SETH ROGAN IS GOING TO BE HERE.
OH, HE'S A FUNNY MAN H.'S
CURRENTLY GOT A NEW COMEDY OUT
ABOUT A... CANCER.
OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, LET'S BEGIN THE NIGHT
WITH CAMPAIGN OBAMA.
HIS REELECTION BID HAS TAKEN
THEM TO THE WEST COAST WHERE
BETWEEN SPEECHES AND FUND-RAISER
IT IS FIRST FELLA VISITED
SILICON VALLEY AT A TOWN HALL
EVENT HOSTED BY THE COMPANY
LINKEDIN-- WHATEVER THAT IS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WE CONNECT HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ULTIMATELY
AROUND THE WORLD.
BY CONNECTING TALENT AND
OPPORTUNITY.
>> Jon: OH, IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN E-MAIL
IN-BOX FLOODING SERVICE WHOSE
SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO
REMIND ME A GUY I WENT TO HIGH
SCHOOL WITH WOULD LIKE ME TO
JOIN LINKED IN AND SPAM EVERYONE
I EVER MET.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF IT HELPS PEOPLE GET JOBS...
>> I HAVE A 222 YEAR VERY
SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN I.T.
MANAGEMENT.
>> I LOST MY JOB IN 2009.
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MY
MOTHER.
SHE'S CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED.
>> I'M FROM CHICAGO.
RECENTLY UNEMPLOYED.
>> I GUESS WHAT WE'RE SAYING,
MR. PRESIDENT, I DON'T THINK
THIS LINKEDIN THING WORKS.
WE'VE BEEN POSTING FOR YEARS AND
EVERYONE'S STILL UNEMPLOYED.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS LIKE GOING TO A
CRAIGSLIST TOWN HALL AND HAVING
PEOPLE GET UP "DO YOU KNOW ANY
ONLINE SITES WHERE YOU CAN GATE
HAND JOB AND A GENTLY-USED
FUTON?"
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
"IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET?"
MY ASSUMPTION IS THEY'RE
APPLAUDING THE HAND JOB AND NOT
THE FUTON.
(LAUGHTER)
IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR
THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT AS HE
HELD A $250 A PERSON FUND-RAISER
AT THE HOLLYWOOD HOUSE OF BLUES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS IS THE TROUBLE WITH THESE
HOLLYWOOD EVENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
, THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE MEL
GIBSON'S GOING TO SHOW UP!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS THE BEAVER!
LISTEN, HOW BAD CAN THE ECONOMY
BE WHEN A NUT CAN SPEND $250
JUST TOO YELL (BLEEP) TO THE
PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
UNLESS THE PRESIDENT IS USING
HIS FALLING POLL NUMBERS TO FUND
RAISE.
YEAH, FOR $250, YOU CAN YELL
STUFF AT HIM.
FOR $500 YOU CAN GIVE HIM THE
CLASSIC PSYCHOHAND SHAKE.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
(BLEEP).
MAYBE HE'LL TAKE MAKE WHICH YOU
