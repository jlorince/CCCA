SON OF A BITCH.
AT LEAST NOT ALL PUNDITS WERE
BLINDED BY THEIR DESIRE TO SEE
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.
>> I THINK THAT WE CAN TAKE
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE AT HIS WORD.
I THINK HE KIND OF PUT THE NAIL
IN THE COFFIN OF SPECULATION
THAT HE WOULD RUN BY THE
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE MADE TODAY.
>> AND IF I WERE THE MEDIA I
WOULD BY GOSH GO BACK THE
LAVISHING UNWARRANTED ATTENTION
ON OTHER POSSIBLE NON-CANDIDATES
WHO HAVE SENT MAYBE MORE MIXED
MESSAGES.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S SARAH PALIN WEARING WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A VEST MADE FROM
THE PELT OF A COOKIE MONSTER SHE
SHOT FROM A HELICOPTER.
[LAUGHTER]
COULD BE... COULD BE FOUND ON
FOX LITERALLY LESS THAN A MINUTE
AFTER CHRIS CHRISTIE HAD SPOKEN.
LIKE AN ALARM WENT OFF THAT THEY
WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY
ELSE.
TO REASSURE THE NATION THAT NOT
EVERY POSSIBLE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE HAD MADE A CLEAR
DECISION.
>> OKAY.
FOR LOGISTICAL REASONS, THOUGH,
CERTAINLY DECISIONS HAVE TO BE
MADE.
THROUGH MY PROCESSION OF
DECISION MAKING WITH MY FAMILY
AND WITH MY CLOSE FRIENDS AS TO
WHETHER I SHOULD THROW MY NAME
IN THE HAT FOR THE GOP
NOMINATION OR NOT FOR 2012, IS A
TITLE WORTH IT?
>> Jon: I GET IT.
IS IT WORTH THE SCRUTINY ON YOUR
FAMILY, THE INCREDIBLE BURDEN OF
RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS THE
PRESIDENCY OF THESE UNITED
STATES, THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
LITERALLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
THAT'S REASONABLE AND I AM
ASSUMING I AM CORRECT IN MY
ASSESSMENT OF YOUR THOUGHT
PROCESS.
>> IS A TITLE WORTH IT?
DOES A TITLE SHACKLE A PERSON?
ARE THEY, SOMEONE LIKE ME, WHO
IS A MAVERICK, I DO GO ROGUE AND
I CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT, AND I
DON'T MIND STIRRING IT UP IN
ORDER TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK AND
DEBATE AGGRESSIVELY AND TO FIND
SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT
OUR COUNTRY IS FACING.
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONSOLATION
PIECE IN MY PROCESSION.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE BIGGEST
CONTEMPLATION PIECE IN YOUR
PROCESS IS THAT BECOMING THE
PRESIDENT WOULD DIMINISH YOUR
POWER?
IT'S NOT THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE
ABLE TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE
PRESIDENCY, IT'S THAT THAT
BALLPARK AIN'T BIG ENOUGH TO
CONTAIN YOUR AWESOMENESS.
THE PRESIDENCY WOULD LIMIT YOU
HOW?
>> DOES A TITLE TAKE AWAY MY
FREEDOM TO CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT
AND TO AFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE
THAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY?
DOES THAT PROHIBIT ME FROM BEING
OUT THERE, OUT OF A BOX, NOT
ALLOWING HANDLERS TO SHAPE ME
AND TO FORCE MY MESSAGE TO BE
WHAT DONORS OR WHAT CONTRIBUTORS
OR WHAT POLITICAL PUNDITS WANT
IT TO BE.
>> Jon: YOU'D BE THE [BLEEPED]
PRESIDENT.
YOU WOULD BE THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF HISTORY'S
GREATEST FIGHTING FORCE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT... WHAT... WHAT POSSIBLY DO
YOU MEAN?
AND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND, I AM
NOT TRYING TO TALK YOU INTO
RUNNINGFUL -- RUNNING.
[LAUGHTER]
BY MOST PEOPLE'S STANDARDS, THE
PRESIDENCY IS ONE OF THE
HIGHER-LEVEL POSITIONS WE HAVE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
PERHAPS I AM NOT GIVING YOUR
RENEGADE ALASKAN BIRD SPIRIT
ENOUGH CREDIT.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT PAILIN WISDOM WOULD A
PRESIDENTIAL RUN SILENCE?
I KNOW YOU'RE A BIG DEAL, YOU'RE
A FORMER GOVERNOR AND YOU
STARRED ON A SHOW ON THE SAME
NETWORK THAT HAS BROUGHT US
THREE SHOWS ABOUT DWARFS.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, IF I MAY, YOU SPENT YOUR
SUMMER VACATION ON A
CONSTITUTION-WRAPPED BUS THAT
YOU SIGNED SHUTTLING BETWEEN
IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, GIVING
SPEECHES LIKE THIS?
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT MY
PLAN IS.
>> I WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF
OBAMA'S MANIPULATION OF U.S.
SUPPLIES OF ENERGY, DRILL HERE,
DRILL NOW.
I SUPPOSE TO ELIMINATE ALL
FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE THING.
YOU COULD HAVE A COLORFUL BUS
AND DRIVE TO EARLY PRIMARY
STATES OR GO AROUND TELLING
PEOPLE WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU
WERE PRESIDENT, BUT WHEN YOU PUT
THOSE TWO TOGETHER, THERE'S
REALLY ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES.
YOU ARE EITHER RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OR YOU ARE A CRAZY PERSON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
