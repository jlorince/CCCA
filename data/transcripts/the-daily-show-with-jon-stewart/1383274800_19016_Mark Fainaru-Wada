FOR ESPN, HISNEW BOOK HE COWROTE WITH HIS
BROTHER ISCALLED "LEAGUE OF DENIAL", TH
NFL CONCUSSIONS AND THE BATTLEFOR TRUTH, WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM MARK FAINARU-WADA.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Stewart: I KNEW IT.
HOW ARE YOU, MARK, NICE TO SEEYOU.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stewart: THE BOOK IS CALLED"LEAGUE OF DENIAL", THE GENERAL
SORT OF SYNOPSIS, APPARENTLY250-POUND, IN SHAPE MEN SMASHING
THEIR HEADS INTO EACH OTHERREPEATEDLY CAUSES PERMANENT
DAMAGE AND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALLLEAGUE SAID TO THEM, UH, NO, NO,
IT'S COOL.
I MEAN.
>> THAT IS REALLY THE MESSAGE, ITHINK STEVE AND I AS WE DID THE
REPORTING ON THE BOOK I THINKWHAT STRUCK US WAS THE PROFOUND
LEVEL OF THAT DENIAL.
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TWODECADES OF DENIAL, SORT OF
TRAJECTORY OF ON THE ONE HAND,YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ATTACKING
INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS THESCIENTISTS WHO THINK THEY WILL
HELP THE NFL AND SAY LOOK YOUHAVE THIS PROBLEM THAT BRAIN
DAMAGE CAN BE CAUSED BY PLAYINGIN THE NFL INSTEAD OF EMBRACING
THOSE GUYS, THE NFL IS MOCKINGTHEM, ATTACKING THEM AND TRYING
TO DENY THEIR VERY EXISTENCE INSOME WAYS AND CREATE THEIR OWN
RESEARCH ARM AND THAT RESEARCHARM BASICALLY PUTS OUT PAPER
AFTER PAPER AND A JOURNALCOOPTED BY THE LEAGUE ITSELF.
>> Stewart: RIGHT.
>> AND THE PAPERS SAY, NFLPLAYERS ARE FINE, LIKE
CONCUSSIONS ARE NOT A BIG ISSUE,WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
THIS AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TOBE COOL.
>> Stewart: MEANWHILE, PLAYERSCONTINUE TO SUFFER TERRIBLE
EFFECTS OF THESE CONCUSSIONS,AND AFTER PASSING AWAY, AT MUCH
EARLIER AGES WHEN THEY DO THEAUTOPSY, THEY FIND THIS CTE.
>> RIGHT, CHRONIC TRAUMATICENCEPHALOPATHY, THIS TERRIBLE
BRAIN DISEASE CAUSED BYPLAYING THE GAME.
RIGHT.
>> I MEAN THERE ARE SEVERALSTORIES IN THE BOOK ABOUT, ONE
GUY FOR EXAMPLE, DAVE DUORSONWHO PLAYED FOR YEARS FOR THE
CHICAGO BEARS, ONE OF THEGREATEST PLAYERS, REALLY HARD
HITTER AND DUORSON WAS ONE OFTHE
DENIERS AND SPENT YEARS SAYINGTHIS WAS NOT AN ISSUE AND BEFORE
CONGRESS TALKING ABOUT IT WASN'TAN ISSUE BUT  HIS LIFE, IT
JUST FALLS APART AT THE END, HEREALLY STARTS TO LOSE IT AND
EVENTUALLY THERE IS A DRAMATICSCENE IN THE BOOK, SORT OF
MACABRE BEFORE HE SHOOTS HIMSELFIN THE CHEST HE SORT OF PAYS
HOMAGE TO CONCUSSIONS, HE LAYSOUT A MAGAZINE, A SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED ABOUT CONCUSSIONS,HE LAYS OUT DISABILITY FILES
ABOUT CONCUSSIONS AND SHOOTSHIMSELF AND SAYS PLEASE STUDY MY
BRAIN, CLEARLY THERE ISSOMETHING GOING ON WITH THAT, I
WANT THE NFL TO LOOK AT IT ANDWHEN THEY DO THEY FIND INDEED HE
HAS THIS DISEASE, CTE.
>> Stewart: THE OTHER SIDE OF,YOU KNOW, NOW YOU KNOW THIS, IT
IS NOT LIKE KNOWING THIS STOPSIT.
I LOVE WATCHING FOOTBALL ANDTHESE ARE GROWN MEN MAKING
CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES.
YOU KNOW, LORD KNOWS THAT INTERMS OF ATHLETICS, LIKE BOXING
THEY KNOW BOXING CAUSES BRAINDAMAGE AND INSTEAD OF STOPPING
BOXING, WE AS AMERICANS DECIDEWHAT IF WE DID IT WITHOUT GLOVES
AND YOU COULD USE YOUR KNEES ANDELBOWS.
>> YES.
AGAIN, WHAT, WHAT IF WE WENT FORTHE CONCUSSIONS QUICKER, HOW
ABOUT THAT?
>> Stewart: I THINK STEVE ANDI HAVE HUGE FOOTBALL FANS, WE
ARE SEASON TICKET HOLDERS WELOVE THE SPORT AND THE GAME AND,
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS ABOUTINFORMED DECISION AND THAT WAS
LARGELY, I MEAN, WE WENT TO DOTHE BOOK IT WAS TO TAKE A HARD
LOOK WHAT DID THE NFL KNOW ANDWHEN DID THEY KNOW IT?  AT THE
SAME TIME IT WAS TO INFORMPEOPLE
BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION ISHAPPENING, I MEAN YOU HAVE
PLAYERS WHO ARE REALLY PISSEDOFF AND UPSET FOR TWO DECADES
THE LEAGUE WAS BASICALLY TELLINGTHEM LOOK YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO
BE FINE IF YOU PLAY FOOTBALL ANDTHEN, BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE AT
THE LOWER LEVELS NOW, AND THENFL MESSAGE TRICKLES DOWN AND
WHERE THE DISCUSSION IS REALLYHAPPENING NOW AND IT IS SORT OF
INTERESTING YOU HAVE PARENTSTALKING TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT DO
YOU WANT TO PLAY.
>> Stewart: RIGHT.
>> AND I THINK THAT DISCUSSIONIS DIFFERENT THAN THE NFL
DISCUSSION.
I DON'T WANT THE LEAGUE TOCHANGE, I LOVE IT, IT'S A
BRUTAL, VIOLENT SPORT AND I LOVEIT.
>> Stewart: DOES THIS ALL GOAWAY IF THE LEAGUE, JUST THE ONE
CHANGE THEY MAKE IS WHEN YOU ARESIGNED TO A PROFESSIONAL TEAM
THEY HAND YOU A PIECE OF PAPERAND SAY, JUST SIGN THAT REAL
QUICK?
>> A RELEASE.
>> Stewart: YOU MAY END UPWITH A BRAIN THAT IS LIKE
OATMEAL, HERE, SIGN THIS.
>> WELL, I THINK NOW THAT ISSUEIS SORT OF DONE FOR THEM, RIGHT?
>> Stewart: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE NOW THE INFORMATIONIS OUT THERE, EITHER FROM US OR
OTHERS IT IS AN INFORMEDDECISION AND THEY CAN'T ARGUE
ANYMORE, BUT FOR TWO DECADES YOUHAD PLAYERS WHO ARE NOW SAYING
LOOK, YOU GUYS MISLED US AND ITHINK.
>> Stewart: THAT IS REALLY THEISSUE.
>> THAT IS THE ISSUE AND ALSOTHAT ISSUE TRICKLES DOWN BECAUSE
AGAIN THE LEAGUE'S MESSAGE WASALWAYS ABOUT VIOLENCE FOR YEARS
IF YOU WATCHED AND SPENT TIME ONTHIS, THE NFL MESSAGE ABOUT
VIOLENCE, EVERYTHING WAS ALLABOUT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SPORT
AND NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THELEAGUE IT IS MARKETING SAFETY,
IT IS ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THEYBRING MOMMY BLOGGERS
TO NEW YORK,SECTION ON THIS, MOMMY BLOGGERS
THAT COME TO NEW YORK AND THEYARE EDUCATING THEM ABOUT THE
SAFETY OF THE SPORT AND IT ISALL ABOUT THAT MESSAGE TO
YOUNGER PLAYERS.
>> Stewart: EVERYTHING WITHTHE NFL NOW SEEMS TO BE, GUYS,
TO THE PLAYERS, KEEP THEVIOLENCE OFF THE FIELD, PLEASE,
JUST DO IT IN YOUR PERSONALLIVES.
TAKE IT  OUT ON THE ONES YOULOVE.
>> WELL -- I MEAN, CLEARLY THEMESSAGE IS, THIS IS -- WE NEED
THE FIND A WAY TO BE SAFE.
>> Stewart: RIGHT.
>> BUT THAT CONCEPT ISRIDICULOUS AT THE NFL LEVEL.
>> Stewart: THAT IS SORT OFTHE POINT IS WHAT DO YOU DO AT
SOME LEVEL?  AND FIVE MINUTES,STICK AROUND.
"LEAGUE OF DENIAL", ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW, IT IS LIKE A
MYSTERY NOVEL AND HAVE THEY READTHIS HANDLE CONTACTED YOU AT THE
NFL?
>> WE HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD FROMTHEM.
>> Stewart: THAT IS NOT GOOD.
>> I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THISBOOK.
MARK FAINARU-WADA, WE WILL BERIGHT BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT
MORE.
