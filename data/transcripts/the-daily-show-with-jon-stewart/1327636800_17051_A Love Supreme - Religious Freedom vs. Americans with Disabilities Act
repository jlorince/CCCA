IN THE MIDWEST, THE
HEARTLAND.
SO BUT IT'S NOT ALL DIRTY
TALK AND SEXY TIME AT THE
SUPREME COURT THEY ARE ALSO
DABBLING IN WEIGHTIER FIRST
AMENDMENT ISSUES SUCH AS.
>> IS THERE SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY A
CHURCH MANAGINGS ITS
EMPLOYEES THAT THE
GOVERNMENT CAN'T TOUCH, AND
A WOMAN WHO WAS A TEACHER AT
A LUTHERAN SCHOOL IN
MICHIGAN DEVELOPED A DISEASE
KNOWN AS NARCOLEPSY WHICH
CAUSED ANOTHER FALL INTO
PERIODS OF DEEP SLEEP.
SO SHE LEFT FOR TREATMENT.
WHEN THEY CAME BACK THE
CHURCH SAID SORRY, WE DON'T
HAVE ANY OPENINGS.
>> Jon: MOST PLACES CAN'T
FIRE SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NARCOLEPSY, THE
AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES
ACT BUT CAN A CHURCH.
IT'S ON.
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM V THE
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY
ACT.
THERE IS ONLY THREE WAYS IT
CAN GO.
EITHER 5-4 OR 4-5 OR MAYBE 4
AND A HALF, 4 AND A HALF.
>> WE HAVE SOME BREAKING
NEWS FOUR OUT OF THE SUPREME
COURT IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION THE JUSTICES RULED
THAT A TEACHER FIRED FOR A
DISABILITY FROM A RELIGIOUS
SCHOOL CANNOT SUE.
>> 9-0 WITH THE COURT LIB
RAMS JOINING THE
CONSERVATIVES.
NONE OF THE LIBERALS EVEN
WROTE SEPARATELY TO SAY A
PEEP ABOUT THIS DECISION.
THEY OBVIOUSLY AGREED IN IT
SO MUCH.
>> WHOA, 9-0.
THESE JUDGES WERE 8-1 ON
WHETHER WORK SUKD OR NOT.
GINSBURG IS ALL IT WAS LIKE
A MODERN DAY BOSUM BUDDY.
IT'S LIKE PUSY TIMES 2, WE
NEED THESE SHOWS.
MORE MORE ON THE RELIGIOUS
ENG, EXEMPTION STORY WE GO

CHIPPER.
>> Jon: ARE YOU, ARE YOU
SMILING.
>> WELL, I JUST FIND TIN
DIEGO-- INTRIGUING THAT THE
NINE JUSTICES IN THEIR
WISDOM UNANIMOUSLY AGREED
THAT RELIGIOUS LAW CAN
OVERRIDE CIVIL LAW, WHETHER
IT'S A LUTHERAN ORR ABINICAL
COUNCIL OR THE IMAM OF A
MOSQUE.
>> Jon: WLOE, I SEE WHERE
YOU ARE GOING, NO, NO, MY
FRIEND, FORGET IT.
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING THIS
DECISION PAVES THE WAY FOR
THE SHARIA LAW HERE IN
AMERICA WITH THE HALLA PART.
>> I'M JUST SAYING, FOR
INSTANCE THERE IS THIS MOSS
INCOME FLORIDA WHERE A JUDGE
TRIED TO USE SHARIA LAW TO
SOLVE A DISPUTE BETWEEN
MUSLIMS.
>> Jon: TOTALLY DIFFERENT
SITUATION.
>> WHY?
>> Jon: YOU MUSLIM --
>> MUSLIMS ARE SCARY.
>> SO YOU SAY LUTHERANS CAN
USE THE CHURCH TO SOLVE
THEIR DISPUTES BUT A MOSQUE
CAN'T USE THEIR RELIGIOUS
LAW.
>> Jon: NO, NO, AASIF, NO-- YES.
>> WHY?
>> Jon: LUTHERANS ARE VERY
EASY GOING.
THEY CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS,
WEAR SWEATER VEST, FROM WHAT
I UNDERSTAND THEY LOVE PARK.
I JUST THINK THAT THE
SCARIEST LUTHERAN THEY ONLY
HAVE IS WILLIAM H. MACY
WHO'S AWESOME.
>> YEAH, YEAH, NOW.
BUT BY NOW HE'S 95 FEET FROM
THE CATHEDRAL DOOR, MARTIN
LUTHER PARTS EUROPE IN A
CENTURY OF BLOODY RELIGIOUS
WAR AND ALL WE HAD WAS ALL
HE HAD WAS A HAMMER AND
STATIONERY, JUST IMAGINE
WHAT THEY WILL DO WITH THE
FULL FORCE OF THE SUPREME
COURT BEHIND THEM.
TODAY IT'S FIRING TEACHERS.
TOMORROW IT IS FORCING YOUR
KIDS TO LISTEN PRAYERIE HOME
COMPANION IN SCHOOLS.

THANK YOU, AASIF.
