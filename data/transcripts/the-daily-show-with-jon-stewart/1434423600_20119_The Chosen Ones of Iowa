NONTHREATENING MOTORCYCLEGANGS.
YET SOME THINK THE STATE WAS.97% OF OUR POPULATION
SHOULDN'T GET THIS MUCHATTENTION.
>> IOWA SHOULD NOT BE THEFIRST STATE TO VOTE.
IOWA IS UNREPRESENTATIVE OFTHE U.S.
IT HAS FEWER MINORITIES.
IT HAS HIGHLY AGRICULTURALBASE WHERE WE ARE LARGELY AN
URBAN AND SUBURBAN COUNTRY.

FROM AN URBAN AREA.
AND THAT'S ALL I'M [BLEEP]THINKING ABOUT, SO YOU'RE
WRONG.
>> IT'S IOWANS DOWN HOMEKNOW-HOW THAT MAKES THEM THE
RIGHT CHOICE.
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHINGABOUT THE PEOPLE IN IOWA.
THEY HAVE HOMESPUN WISDOM,SMALL TOWN VALUES.
>> TO SAY THEY HAVE AMONOPOLY ON THE WISDOM OR
MONOPOLY ON SMALL TOWNVALUES IS TO DISREGARD THE
OTHER 300 MILLION PEOPLE INTHE UNITED STATES.
>> WHAT?
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOURIOWA BASHING FOR ONE DAY.
I'M GOING TO IOWA RIGHT NOW.
(HIGH-PICHTED NOISES)
>> OH.. THE [BLEEP]'S ALL THECORN?
IOWA, THERE ISN'T A GROUPOF PEOPLE IN AMERICA MORE
QUALIFIED TO PICK THE NEXTLEADER OF THE FREE WORLD
THAN IOWANS.
JUST ASK IOWAN STEFANSCHMITT.
>> IT'S AN HONOR.
IT'S A JOB.
IT'S KIND OF ARESPONSIBILITY TO BE FIRST
IN SELECTING OR AT LEAST INVOTING FOR WHO WE PREFER FOR
PRESIDENT.

COME ON, DON'T BULL [BLEEP]ME.
YOU LIKE BEING KINGMAKERS,DON'T YOU?

WITH REAL PEOPLING ON GROUNDWHERE THE REST OF US ARE.
>> YOUR CONVICTIONS ARE ASDEEP AS EVERYTHING ELSE ON
THIS TABLE IS FRIED.
GOOD DAY.
>> IOWA IS THE PERFECTTRAINING GROUND TO PREPARE
OUR PRESIDENTS FOR THE WORLDSTAGE.
>> HOW DOES A CANDIDATEREACT TO THE LARGEST HOG IN
THE WORLD, WHICH IS ALWAYS ATTHE STATE FAIR.
>> SURE.
AND HOW THEY REACT TO THEHOG IS POSSIBLY A REFLECTION
ON HOW THEY'RE GOING TO LEADOUR ARMED FORCES.
>> OR HOW THEY MIGHT REACTTO MEETING UNUSUAL
INTERNATIONAL LEADERS THATGIVE THEM SURPRISES, YES.
>> WHICH OF COURSE IS ANEXTROMLY LIKELY SCENARIO.
>> THERE SHOULD BE SOMEROTATION OF THE STATES IN
THE DELEGATE SELECTIONPROCESS.
>> ROTATION WOULD MAKE ASIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE SO
THAT EVERY STATE HAS ANOPPORTUNITY.
>> SO WHAT STATES WOULD YOUHAVE US ROTATE TO?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHTWANT TO START IN NEW YORK.
>> TOO JEWY.
>> ALABAMA THEN.

THEMSELVES AROUND IN FRONTOF SOME BURNED OUT HIPPY
[BLEEP] IN SANTA FE?
AND BESIDES, ALTHOUGH IOWAALMOST NEVER PICKS CANDIDATES
WHO WIN, WHAT IS THE HARM?
>> BECAUSE IOWA IS FIRST INTHE NATION, THERE ARE
CERTAIN ISSUES THAT AREHIGHLIGHTED THAT MAY NOT
HAVE NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.
TAKE ETHANOL, FOR INSTANCE.
>> OF COURSE, WONDERFULETHANOL, WHERE SURE TAXPAYERS
PAY $6 BILLION A YEAR FOR AFUEL SOURCE THAT
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY ISWORSE THAN GASOLINE, BUT
THEY'RE WRONG BECAUSE IOWASAYS THEY ARE WRONG.
RIGHT?
>> THE ETHANOL LOBBY HAS ALOT OF POWER AND A LOT OF
MONEY.
ETHANOL SHOULD NOT HAVE SUCHA SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE.
>> [BLEEP].
>> IN THE ISSUES FACING OURPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
>> DON'T TALK [BLEEP] ABOUTETHANOL, ARE YOU [BLEEP] CRAZY?
HEY, RICK, DON'T GET US[BLEEP] IN A LOT OF TROUBLE
OVER THIS INTERVIEW.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
