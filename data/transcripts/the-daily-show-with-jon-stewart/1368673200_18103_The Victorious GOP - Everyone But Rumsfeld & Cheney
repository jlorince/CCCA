EMBARRASSING.
ANYWAY, SO THIS IS ALL BAD FOR
THE ADMINISTRATION.
THE QUESTION IS, HOW BAD?
>> THIS IS NIXONIAN.
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHOSE INNER
NIXON IS BEING REVEALED
>> Jon: THAT'S IT.
IF THESE MEASURES FROM THE
I.R.S. AND JUSTICE WERE TAKEN AT
THE BEHEST OF THE WHITE HOUSE
THAT IS NIXONIAN.
AT BEST, IF YOU BELIEVE THE
ADMINISTRATION ONLY FOUND OUT
ABOUT THIS STUFF THROUGH NEWS
REPORTS, IT'S STILL BAD.
IT'S JUST THAT THE PRESIDENT'S
INNER MAGOO IS BEING REVEALED.
IT'S MAGOOVIAN.
I REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT MAGOO
NOMINATED A COAT RACK FOR
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
IT WAS COMICAL.
UNTIL, OF COURSE, THE
DEVASTATING DEPRESSION.
BUT THIS WEEK I CAN'T NITPICK.
THE FLOOD GATES ARE OPEN.
EVERY CRITIC SUDDENLY HAS
CREDIBILITY.
EVERY SINGLE ONE.
WHO WOULDN'T HAVE THE STANDING
TO BE ABLE TO LEGITIMATELY
CRITICIZE THIS PRESIDENT.
I CAN'T IMAGINE.
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE...
Jon: HOLD ON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AREN'T YOU DONALD RUMSFELD?
I ASSUME YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY
SOMETHING LIKE I CAN'T IMAGINE
POSSIBLY COMMENTING ON SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, GIVEN MY DUBIOUS
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOOD
GOVERNANCE.
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW A PERSON
COULD STAND UP THERE WHEN
EVERYONE INVOLVED KNEW IT WAS A
TERRORIST ATTACK.
THE IDEA THAT IT WAS SOMEHOW
RELATED TO A YOU TUBE VIDEO AND
THAT THAT NARRATIVE KEPT BEING
PROMOTED, I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE
IT FIT THEIR HOPES AND WHAT THEY
WANTED TO BE THE INDICATION.
... WHAT THEY WANTEDDED TO BE
THE CASE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, DONALD
RUMSFELD.
I WAS THINKING THERE WAS NO WAY
TO OVERREACH.
YOU BELIEVED THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION IS PROMOTING A
NARRATIVE, NOT BECAUSE IT'S REAL
BUT BECAUSE IT FITS THEIR HOPES
AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE THE
CASE?
YOU?
SENIOR W.M.D. MAGILL CUTTY,
ESQUIRE.
THE GUY WHO WANTED TO GO AFTER
SADDAM HUSSEIN ON 9/11 WHILE THE
PRESIDENT WAS STILL READING "MY
PET GOAT"?
YOU?
AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MAKE THAT
ATTACK HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH SADDAM
HUSSEIN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
9/11?
RUMSFELD IS GERMAN FOR PROMOTING
A NARRATIVE BECAUSE IT FITS YOUR
HOPES AND WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
THE CASE.
IT IS THE RARE GERMAN WORD THAT
IS ACTUALLY SHORTER THAN THE
THING IT IS DESCRIBING.
SO, NO!
YOU ALONE DON'T GET TO COME TO
THE VICTORY PARADE FOR THE
REPUBLICANS.
YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY WHO DOESN'T
GET TO WEIGH IN.
>> I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE WORST
INCIDENTS FRANKLY
>> Jon: DID I SAY ONE GUY?
IS THAT HE WHOSE NAME I DARE NOT
SPEAK.
THE ONE WHO SETS OFF MY
CHENEY-DAR.
WHO LED OUR COUNTRY ASTRAY-DAR?
SHOT HIS FRIEND IN THE FAY-DAR?
HAS THE HEART OF GRAY-DAR?
DON'T.
YOU.
DARE.
>> I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE WORST
INCIDENTS THAT FRANKLY THAT I
CAN RECALL IN MY CAREER.
THEY CLAIMED IT WAS BECAUSE OF A
DEMONSTRATION VIDEO SO THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT
WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT THEIR
COMPETENCE.
THEY LIED.
>> Jon: YOU DO NOT GET TO USE
THE L-WORD.
IN FACT, YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO
WATCH THE L-WORD.
DICK.
WHICH I CAN CALL YOU BECAUSE
THAT'S YOUR NAME.
AFTER THE THE LINES YOU TOLD,
YOU DON'T GET TO DOUBT ANYONE'S
CREDIBILITY.
IF A BASEBALL BREAKS YOUR WINDOW
AND YOUR GRAND KID WALKS IN THE
DOOR WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND
TELLS YOU THAT ZACH AND CODY
FROM THE SWEET LIFE DID IT WHILE
THEY WERE PLAYING A GAME WITH
SPONGE BOB, YOU JUST HAVE TO
[BLEEP] CHOKE THAT DOWN.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.
AND LISTEN CLOSE.
ALL OF THESE SCANDALS COULD ADD
UP TO VERY BAD REPERCUSSIONS FOR
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
MANY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS
ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR MOMENT OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT GUESS WHAT?
HISTORY DIDN'T START FRIDAY.
AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
TRANSGRESSIONS DON'T WIPE AWAY
YOURS WHICH ARE MANY AND
GRIEVOUS.
ENJOY WATCHING YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
THEIR FUN BUT TWEEDAL-DICK AND
TWEEDAL-RUM DON'T GET TO JOIN
THE PARTY.
IT'S LIKE THIS.
IT'S LIKE THIS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S MIKE TYSON.
HE DOESN'T GET TO MAKE FUN OF
SOMEONE'S TATTOO.
