[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL SHOW,
VERY SPECIAL GUEST TONIGHT.
MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS LEROY PETRY
WILL BE JOINING US ON THE
PROGRAM TONIGHT.
WE'RE HONORED.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT, OF COURSE,
WITH THE LOOMING CRISIS.
AS YOU KNOW, ON AUGUST 2nd, IF
AMERICA FAILS TO RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING, WE DEFAULT ON OUR DEBT.
PEOPLE LOSE THE CAPACITY TO
LOVE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND ANIMALS LOSE THE CAPACITY TO
LICK THEIR OWN GENITALS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IF WE DON'T RAISE THE DEBT
CEILING ON AUGUST 2nd, MAN
WILL BE SENTENCED TO AN ETERNITY
OF LICKING OUR OWN PET'S
GENITAL, BECAUSE WHAT WOULD WE
REALLY DO?
LET THEM DRY OUT?
OF COURSE NOT.
[LAUGHTER]
SO HOPEFULLY OUR PRESIDENT,
BARACK OBAMA, CAN IN ONE SWIFT
ROOSEVELTIAN "WE HAVE NOTHING TO
FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF" MOMENT
EASE THE AMERICAN PSYCHOI CAN.
>> CAN YOU TELL THE FOLKS AT
HOME THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
THE SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS WILL
GO OUT ON AUGUST 3rd.
>> I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THOSE
CHECKS GO OUT ON AUGUST 3rd IF
WE HAVEN'T RESOLVED THIS ISSUE
BECAUSE THERE MAY SIMPLY NOT BE
THE MONEY IN THE COFFERS TO DO
IT.
>> Jon: [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
WE NEED OUR CHECK!
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO, NO, IT'S
FINE.
IT'S JUST OLE PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE.
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO JUST
BLOW THAT MONEY ON MEDICINE AND
HIPS.
OF COURSE, OUR POLITICAL LEADERS
SMART, DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS.
THEY'VE BEEN IN NON-STOP
MEETINGS TRYING TO PREVENT THIS
FROM HAPPENING.
HOW ARE THOSE MEETINGS GOING.
>> THE DEBT TALKS BLOW UP.
>> AN ANGRY PRESIDENT OBAMA
WALKED OUT.
>> TEMPERATURES BEGAN RISING
AFTER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC
CANTOR SUGGESTED THE SIDES WERE
TOO FAR APART TO GET TO A DEAL.
THAT'S WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOT
VERY AGITATED.
HE SAID, "DON'T CALL MY BLUFF,
ERIC."
>> THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED, "I
HAVE SHOWN ENORMOUS WILLINGNESS
TO COMPROMISE."
>> MR. OBAMA THEN LEFT SAYING,
"I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW."
>> Jon: OH, [BLEEPED].
OH, NO, HE DIDN'T.
THE PRESIDENT STORMED OUT AND
WAS LIKE, OKAY, TOMORROW THEN.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT?
THAT'S NOT STORMING OUT.
THAT'S ENDING A MEETING BY
SCHEDULING NEXT MEETING.
AND I GOT TO SAY, IF THAT'S
OBAMA MAD, THAT'S WEAK.
HE'S STILL SO IN CONTROL.
YOU GET THE SENSE IF HE WERE THE
HULK, WHEN HE FELL HIS ANGER
CAUSING THE TRANSFORMATION, HE
WOULD JUST EXCUSE HIMSELF TO
CHANGE INTO A BIGGER SUIT, AS TO
NOT NEEDLESSLY SHRED A PERFECTLY
GOOD OUTFIT.
BUT THERE WAS ONE SENTENCE IN
THAT NEWS REPORT THAT REALLY
CAUGHT MY EAR.
CAN WE HEAR THAT SENTENCE AGAIN?
>> HE SAID, "DON'T CALL MY
BLUFF, ERIC."
>> Jon: COUPLE OF THINGS.
ONE, "DON'T CALL MY BLUFF" KIND
OF IMPLIES A GAME.
THE IMMINENT POSSIBLE ECONOMIC
COLLAPSE OF OUR COUNTRY IS A
CHIP THE PRESIDENT WILL PLAY OR
NOT PLAY GIVEN THE RELATIVE
STRENGTH OF HIS HAND.
AND SECOND, I THINK WHEN YOU'RE
PLAYING THAT HAND, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO TELL THE OTHER GUY
IT'S A BLUFF.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THIRDLY, BOY THE NAME ERIC
REALLY TAKES THE URGENCY AND
STEAM OUT OF AN ARGUMENT,
DOESN'T IT?
DON'T CALL MY BLUFF, ERIC.
REALLY.
IT'S NAME ONLY RIVALED BY CRAIG
AND SUSAN.
I WILL DESTROY YOU, CRAIG.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH,
SUSAN.
