>> Jon:  WELCOME. TO THE DAILYSHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, A ONEWILLIAM O'REILLY.
WILL BE JOINING US FOR ONE OFOUR PATENTED
WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE DO.
BASICALLY IT WILL BE LIKE YOU ATHOME AT THANKSGIVING WITH TWO
UNCLES YOU REALLY WISH DIDN'TSHOW UP.
BUT FIRST, WITH LESS THAN TWOWEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY,
AMERICA, THAT'S US.
HAS RESIGNED ITSELF TO GOINGTHROUGH THE MOTIONS OF
ANOTHER MIDTERM CAMPAIGN.
AND FOREMOST AMONG THOSEMOTIONS, DEBATES.
A CHANCE FOR CANDIDATES TOPRESENT AND DEFEND THEIR IDEAS
THROUGH REASONED ARTICULATEDISCOURSE.
I'M JUST KIDDING.
>> CANDIDATES LOOKING FOR ACOMEBACK ARE HOPING THEIR
OPPONENTS HAVE AN OOPS MOMENT ONSTAGE TO TRY AND SHIT MOMENTUM.
>> Jon: YOU CAN FORM A COGENTARGUMENT.
[LAUGHTER]OR YOU CAN STAND THERE QUIETLY
AND WAIT FOR YOUR OPPONENT'S[BLEEP] TO SLIP OUT OF HIS
PANTS.
[LAUGHTER]AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF NOT FOR
SOME POORLY CONSTRUCTEDPANTALOONS SLAVERY MAY NEVER
HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED.
POINT LINCOLN.
[LAUGHTER]THE DEBATES ARE THE SUBJECT OF
DEMOCALYPSE 2014: JUST TRY NOTTO SAY SOMETHING STUPID FOR 90
MINUTES.
[BLEEP] SLIPS ASIDE, WHAT'S BEENINTERESTING ABOUT THESE
MIDTERM DEBATES WASTHAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
ARE FINALLY FINDING SOMECOMMON GROUND.
>> I DO NOT AGREE WITH PRESIDENTOBAMA ON HIS ENERGY POLICIES.
>> I HAVE MY DISAGREEMENTS WITHTHE PRESIDENT.
>> WHEN YOU VOTE WITH THEPRESIDENT 96% OF THE TIME, YOU
REPRESENT THE PRESIDENT'SPOLICYIES.
>> I DISAGREE WITH THEPRESIDENT.
>> MARK PRYOR IS A RUBBER STAMPFOR BARACK OBAMA
>> I STOOD YOU REPEATEDLYAGAINST THE PRESIDENT.
>> OBAMA'S GONNA GO DOWN AS ONEOF THE WORST PRESIDENTS.
>> Jon: YOU SEE. ALL THISCOUNTRY REALLY NEEDED TO COME
TOGETHER IS A COMMON ENEMYWHETHER IT BE THE GERMANS OR THE
SOVIETS OR THE MAN WEOVERWHELMINGLY REELECTED TO
LEAD US 23 MONTHS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]IN FACT ...
[LAUGHTER]MANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE
SOUGHT TO SHOW THAT THEIRDEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS WERE IN
FACT LOVING OBAMA.IN FACT, MARRIED TO OBAMA, AND
IS THE MODERN STYLE HAD TAKENHIS NAME AS A HYPHENATE.
>> OBAMA-WARNER POLICIES.
>> THE OBAMA-PRYOR ECONOMY.
>> THIS OBAMA-AIKEN ECONOMY.
>> Jon:  YES, YES.
THE OBAMA-AIKEN ECONOMY.
THE OBAMA-AMERICAN IDOL RUNNERUP TURNED NORTH CAROLINA
CONGRESSIONALCANDIDATE CLAY AIKEN ECONOMY,
WHICH HAS BEEN STRUGGLING DUETO STAGNANT WAGES,
LOSS OF MANUFACTURING BASE ANDBEING A
LITTLE PITCHY, DOLL.
A LITTLE PITCHY.
OF COURSE NOT ALL DEMOCRATS ARERUNNING FROM OBAMA DUE TO HIS
UNPOPULAR POLICY.
DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE FROMKENTUCKY ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES
IS RUNNING FROM OBAMA ONPRINCIPLE.
>> WHY ARE YOU RELUCTANT TOGIVE AN ANSWER ON WHETHER OR
NOT YOU VOTED FORPRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> BILL, THERE'S NO RULUCTANCY.
THIS IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE.
OUR CONSTITUTION GRANTS HERE INKENTUCKY THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT FOR PRIVACY AT THE BALLOTBOX.
>> Jon:  MY COUNTRY TIS OFTHEE.
NO, YOU CANNOT SEE.
[LAUGHTER]I SEE, VOTING IS A RIGHT
TO PRIVACY ISSUE.
EXPLAINS WHY THEY GIVE YOUTHOSE STICKERS WHEN YOU --
[LAUGHTER]AND GRIMES' PRINCIPLED STAND,
GRIMES' PRINCIPLED STANDWAS ONLY SLIGHTLY UNDERMINED
BY HER ANNOUNCING LAST MONTHTHAT IN THE 2008 PRIMARY SHE
VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON. BUTTHAT'S DIFFERENT,
HILLARY IS POPULAR. IT'SALL IN THE CONSTITUTION.
LOOK DEMOCRATS AREN'T THE ONLYONES RUNNING FROM THEIR PARTY.
REPUBLICANS ARE RETREATING ONTHE CULTURE WARS.
>> THE FACT IS I SUPPORT OVERTHE COUNTER CONTRACEPTION.
>> TEN YEARS AGO YOU SUPPORTED AFEDERAL  CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT ON MARRIAGE.DO YOU STILL SUPPORT THAT?
>> IT WAS THE -- WHEN I WASCHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEE.>> RIGHT.
>> IT WAS THE PLATFORM
CALLED FOR A FEDERAL MARRIAGEAMENDMENT AND AS CHAIRMAN OF THE
RNC, I STOOD FOR THE PLATFORM.BUT AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR,
I'M TALKING NOW ABOUT MYPOLICIES.
>> Jon:  MY POLICIES.
NOT THE ONES I WAS PAID TOPRETEND I SUPPORTED OR THE ONES
I WILL BE PAID TO SUPPORT AFTERI LOSE AND BECOME A LOBBYIST FOR
ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OFMULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.
THE POINT IS GIVE ME MONEY ANDI'LL DO WHAT YOU SAY.
ED GILLESPIE, 2014 THE BIDDINGSTARTS NOW.
LOOK, THIS ELECTION'S UNDERLYINGTHEME IS THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE
SO UNPOPULAR THAT THEIRCANDIDATES ARE RUNNING ON HOW
MUCH THEY HATE THEMSELVES.
OF COURSE THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ASLIGHT ADVANTAGE HAVING SPENT
THE LAST SIX YEARS BREAKING OURGOVERNMENT.
THEY NOW GET TO RUN ON THE ANGERRESULTING FROM SAID BROKEN
GOVERNMENT.
AND NOWHERE WAS THIS CYNICALPLOY MORE EVIDENT THAN WITH
SENATE MINORITY LEADER AND SHELLBEARING REPTILE MITCH MCCONNELL.
>> I WILL BE PREPARED TONEGOTIATE WITH THE DEMOCRATS
WHEN WE CAN FIND AREAS OFAGREEMENT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: FOR INSTANCE, WE COULD
START WITH NOBODY LIKESBEING STUNG BY BEES.
[LAUGHTER]THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON.
[LAUGHTER]OF COURSE, DESPITE MCCONNELL'S
SWEARING OF CONCILIARY INTENTTHAT IS COMPLETE BULL [BLEEP].
COMING FROM THE MAN WHOPERSONALLY STOOP UP AT A
REPUBLICAN RETREAT AT THELIBRARY OF CONGRESS
RIGHT BEFORE OBAMA'S 2009INAUGURATION AND SAID
THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO BLOCKTHE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA AS LONG AS
WE  MARCH IN LOCK STEP.
AS LONG AS REPUBLICANS REFUSE TOFOLLOW OBAMA'S LEAD, AMERICANS
WILL SEE PARTISAN FOODFIGHTS AND CONCLUDE THAT
OBAMA HAD FAILED TOPRODUCE CHANGE.
LOOKS LIKE THE TORTOISE WINSAGAIN.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THISSTRATEGY IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU
HAVE TO ATTACK SOMETHING LIKEKENTUCKY'S KYNECT HEALTH CARE
WEBSITE WHICH MCCONNELL CAN'TADMIT WORKS SINCE IT'S GOT
OBAMA STINK ON IT. BUT HE CAN'TSHUT IT DOWN BECAUSE IT WORKS.
WATCH HOW HE MAGICALLY DOES IT.
>> THE WEBSITE CAN CONTINUE BUTIN MY VIEW THE BEST INTEREST OF
THE COUNTRY WOULD BE ACHIEVED BYPULLING OUT OBAMACARE ROOT AND
BRANCH.
>> AND YOU WOULD SUPPORT THECONTINUATION OF KYNECT?
>> WELL, IT'S A STATE DECISION.SEVERAL STATES HAD --
>> BUT WOULD YOU SUPPORT IT?
>> WELL IT'S FINE, YEAH.
I THINK IT'S FINE TO HAVE AWEBSITE. YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon:  MITCH MCCONNELL, HE
WILL KEEP THE WEBSITE BUT HEWILL GET RID OF THE PROGRAM THE
WEBSITE CONNECTS YOU TO.
[LAUGHTER]LEAVE THE WEBSITE IN SOME KIND
OF INTERNET GHOST SO PEOPLE CANSCROLL THROUGH HEALTH
CARE OPTIONS THEY CAN NOLONGER CHOOSE FROM.
OH LOOK, HONEY, HERE'S A PLANTHAT WOULD HAVE PAID FOR YOUR
CHEMO TREATMENTS.
OH, TOO BAD IT NO LONGER EXISTS.
[LAUGHTER]SO IF DEMOCRATS CAN'T RUN ON
ANYTHING THEY'VE DONE IN THEPAST SIX YEARS, AND REPUBLICANS
CAN'T RUN ON MAKING SURENOTHING GOT DONE OVER THE PAST
SIX YEARS.
WHAT DOES ANYONE HAVE LEFT TORUN ON?
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'VEGOT AN EBOLA OUTBREAK,
>> THE GROWING THREAT OF ISIS.
>> ISIS SHOULD BE DESTROYED.>> TAKE ISIS OUT.
>> KEEP AMERICA SAFE FROMTERRORISM.
>> SEAL THE BORDER AND SECUREIT.
>> PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY ANDOUR FAMILIES FROM EBOLA.
>> MIDTERMS 2014.
WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEARITSELF SO WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH
FEAR.
AAAAHHHHHH.
