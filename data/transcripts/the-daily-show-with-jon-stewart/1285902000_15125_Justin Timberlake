>> Jon: ARE YOU A TYPE OF
FACEBOOK PERSON?
HAVE YOU DONE THAT?
I HAVE NOT --
>> I DON'T HAVE -- I'M SORT OF
ADMITTEDLY RIDICULOUSLY STUPID
WITH COMPUTERS.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S GOING
TO HOLD YOU BACK IN YOUR CAREER.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S --
>> I KNOW.
>> Jon: I THINK YOU ARE REALLY
BLOCKING YOURSELF.
>> BOOT SALES ARE UP SO --
>> Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
I HAD NO IDEA YOUR BOOT BUSINESS
WAS GOING WELLEL.
>> THE FORTUNE I'M ABOUT TO WALK
INTO, MISTER.
>> Jon: IF I HAD YOUR FAMILY
BEEN THIS BOOT THING I COULD
HAVE BEEN AS TALENTED AS YOU.

UNFORTUNATELY STEWART NOT A
BOOT-FRIENDLY NAME.
>> Jon: ALL THE RAPPERS --
>> I DON'T SEE PEOPLE HIKING IN
STEWARTS.

TASTE LIKE GROUP.

TALENTED IN THE SING, THE
DANCING, THE ACTING.
YOU HAVE THE RESTAURANTS.
IT MAKES YOU VERY UNLIKABLE.

>> I SORT OF -- I WAS ALL -- IT
WAS ALL A MASTER MINDING SCHEME.
I WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAID I
WANT TO BE AS UNLIKABLE AS
POSSIBLE.
I MOVE FROM THING TO THING SO
PEOPLE WON'T FIND OUT I'M
MODERATELY TALENTED AT EACH ONE
OF THEM.

THESE GUYS, ARE YOU IMPRESSED BY
THEM?
DO YOU FIND -- IT'S A
COMPLICATED STORY BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE ABOUT THE
WAY THIS THING LAID OUT FOR THIS
GUY ZUCKERBERG AND ALL THESE
GUYS.
>> WHAT A BRILLIANT MIND TO SORT
OF PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER.
THE FILM IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT
HIS DIS-- HIS DISCONNECTION TO
PEOPLE AND THAT'S THE IRONY OF
IT THAT HE WOULD INVENT
SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONNECT ALL
OF US AND SO MANY OTHERS AT THE
SAME TIME.
