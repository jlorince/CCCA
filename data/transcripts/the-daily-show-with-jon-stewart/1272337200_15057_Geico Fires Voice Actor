THERE WAS A STORY -- IT HAPPENED LAST WEEK.
WE NEGLECTED TO COVER IT BUT YOU WANTED TO GET TO IT NOW.
IT'S NOTHING LESS THAN A SHOCK INVOLVING ONE OF HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST PLAYERS.
>> MORE ON OUR TOP STORY THE VOICE BEHIND THE GEICO COMMERCIALS IN TROUBLE FOR A
NASTY VOICEMAIL.
>> THE MAN BEHIND THE AD CAMPAIGN HAS LOST HIS JOB.
>> Jon: THE GEICO GECKO HAS BEEN FIRED.
WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO BUY MY INSURANCE FROM NOW, A DUCK?
OR SNOOPY?
THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.
I NEED THE GECKO.
>> BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT THE GECKO.
IT'S NOT THE GUY WHO DOES THE AUSTRALIAN VOICE OF THE GECKO.
IT'S THE GUY WHO SAYS THIS,
LISTEN:
>> 15 MINUTES COULD SAVE YOU 15% OR MORE ON CAR INSURANCE.
>> Jon: NOOOOOO!
NOT THE GUY WHO SAYS 15 MINUTES WILL SAVE YOU WHATEVER THAT GUY SAYS.
I'M AN ADULT.
I CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT TO MY CHILDREN?
WHAT COULD THAT GUY POSSIBLY HAVE SAID ON THE VOICEMAIL TO THE CONSERVATIVE GROUP FREEDOM
WORKS THAT CAUSED HIM TO GET FIRED.
>> HI, THERE I'M DO THE PAPER ABOUT FREEDOM WORKS.
I WAS WONDERING IF SOMEBODY COULD CALL ME BACK.
I WANTED TO KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY RETARDED WHO WORK FOR THE
ORGANIZATION AND ARE MEMBERS OF IT.
>> Jon: THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH.
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH.
[ APPLAUSE ]
QUESTIONING THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY OF MEMBERS IN THE ORGANIZATION OF FREEDOMWORKS.
HOW DID THESE SIMPLETONS CATCH THIS GUY?
ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON POST" HE LEFT A FAKE NUMBER BUT HIS REAL PHONE NUMBER.
WELL F IT ISN'T THE POT -- WELL,
IF IT ISN'T THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE RETARDED.
IT'S LIKE A VANDAL MAKING HIS GRAFFITI TAG HIS HOME ADDRESS.
WHILE THE GEICO GECKO HAS BEEN CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT BEEN A GOOD YEAR
FOR SPOKESPERSON.
FROM THE TONY TIGER COMMERCIAL MAULING TO THE MITCH LYNN MAN'S PUBLIC BATTLE OVER DRUG CHARGES
AND SEX TRAFFICKING.
FOR MORE ON THIS SPOKESMAN CONTROVERSY WE'RE JOINED BY OUR CONTRIBUTOR THE PILLSBURY DOUGH BOY.
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?
NICE --
[LAUGHTER]
WELCOME.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
DOUGH BOY, I THINK YOUR COMMUNITY DODGED A REAL BULLET HERE.
HAVE WE REACHED A TIPPING POINT IN TERMS OF BAD BEHAVIOR?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT JOFERK THE EXAMPLES I LISTED EARLIER AND
HOW WE FELT THE FIRST TIME WE SAW HANDY THE HELPING HAND.
>> THE HELPING HAND FROM HAMBURGER HELPER.
>> ADMIT THE MASTER RACE AND THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL I HELP YOU STRETCH YOUR MEAT BUDGET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: OF COURSE, THAT SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE.
IT WAS NO SECRET WHERE HE GOT HIS START.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> BUT HE DOES EVENTUALLY MAKE UP FOR IT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: THE AUDIENCE IS UPSET THAT HAMBURGER HELPER HAND WAS APPARENTLY IMPLICATED IN
HITLER'S SUICIDE.
APPARENTLY THAT'S WHERE THE AUDIENCE DRAWS THE LINE ON THIS THING.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY ARE OKAY WITH THE NAZI PROPAGANDA IN TERMS OF MAKING DINNER BUT GOD FORBID THEY ALSO
TAKE HITLER OUT.
DOUGHY, YOU YOURSELF HAVE FACED SOME CONTROVERSY NO DOUBT?
>> CHUCK ROLL 12.
>> --
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF.
>> HE WAS ASKING FOR IT.
IT WAS HOT AND STEAMY IT CAME OUT OF TOASTER.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THAT DOUGH BOY.
>> IT WAS CONSENSUAL.
>> Jon: YOU ARE GOING DOWN,
