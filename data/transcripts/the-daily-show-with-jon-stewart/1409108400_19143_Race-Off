SAY STERN RESPONSE BY POLICEWHO APPEAR TO BE
AUDITIONING FORROBO COP. IT'S A, IT'S A STORY

>> OF COURSE YOU ARE. AN UNARMEDBLACK TEENAGER GUNNED DOWN
IN THE STREETS BY POLICE UNDERSUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.
WHO WOULDN'T CUT THEIR VACATIONSHORT TO REGISTER THEIR FURY.
YOU'D HAVE TO BE A MONSTER OR INMY CASE ENJOYING A PARTICULARLY
NICE VACATION.
BUT GOOD ON YOU, MR. O'REILLY,FOR COMING BACK.
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE FURIOUSABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
>> FURIOUS ABOUT HOW THESHOOTING DEATH OF 18-YEAR-OLD
MICHAEL BROWN IS BEINGREPORTED, AND HOW VARIOUS
PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO IT.
>> Jon: YES!
THAT IS THE OUTRAGE.
THE SHOOTING OF MICHAEL BROWNAND ANY LACK OF TRANSPARENCY
FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENTRESPONSIBLE FOR SAID INCIDENT IS
OUTRAGEOUS IN HOW IT HAS BEENREPORTED.
[LAUGHING]>> AND, I GUESS THAT'S NOT THE
ONLY REASON TO BE ANGRY.
>> IS HE GOING TO GET A FARESHAKE, THIS OFFICER?
>> THERE HAS BEEN A RUSH TOJUDGMENT.
>> ERIC HOLDER FLIES INTOFERGUSON.
>> YEAH.
>> YOU KNOW, WITH HIS, WITH HIS,YOU KNOW, SUPER HERO CAPE.
>> THIS MANTRA OF THE UNARMEDBLACK TEENAGER SHOT BY A WHITE
COP. YOU KNOW, THAT DESCRIPTION
IN AND OF ITSELF ACTUALLY COLORSTHE WAY
IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THIS STORY.
>> Jon: YES, DESCRIBING THEACTUAL FACTS OF THE CASE.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: REALLY DOES COLOR THE
WAY WE LOOK AT IT.
WHITE COP, SHOOTS UNARMED BLACKTEEN.
DOES SOUND TERRIBLE.
WHERE AS SAY HERO COP KILLSALIEN HUNTING HUMANS FOR SPORT
WOULD PUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENTSPIN ON THINGS.
WHICH THOUGH A VERY ACCURATEDESCRIPTION OF THE PLOT OF
PREDATOR TWO, IS IN THIS CASEIS -- NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE SOMANY OTHER STORIES OUT THERE.
>> WHY AREN'T WE COVERING NEWYORK.
>> WHY AREN'T WE COVERING BLACKON BLACK CRIME.
>> Jon: YES! WHY ALL THEINTEREST IN HOLDING POLICE
OFFICERS TO A HIGHERSTANDARD THAN GANGS?
THEY BOTH FLASH COLORS. AND,YES ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN
SWORN TO PROTECT AND DEFEND, BUTSTILL --
>> WELL, THIS WEEKEND 42 PEOPLEWERE SHOT IN CHICAGO.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE THEPROTESTS.
I DON'T SEE THE ANGER.
>> IF I WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IWOULD BE OUTRAGED THAT MORE
JOURNALISTS AREN'T COVERINGWHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHICAGO AND
MORE OUTRAGED THAT PEOPLE LIKEAL SHARPTON AND JESSE JACKSON
DON'T HEAD TO THOSE AREAS.
>> Jon: YES. WHAT COULD EXPLAINTHE LACK OF OUTRAGE ABOUT
AL SHARPTON AND HIS ILK NOTDOING ANYTHING
ABOUT BLACK ON BLACKVIOLENCE IN CHICAGO.
>> WITH CHICAGO'S VIOLENCEMAKING NATIONAL HEADLINES, A
GROUP LED BY THE REVEREND ALSHARPTON PLANS TO CONVENE AN
ANTI-VIOLENCE SUMMIT OF NATIONALCIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS HERE.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSEAFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS DID
HOLD A SUMMIT ABOUT THAT INNOVEMBER. AND HAVE MET AT
LEAST THREE TIMES IN THE CITYIN JUST THE LAST 13 MONTHS.
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT'SBEEN EFFECTIVE. BUT TAKEN ALONG
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S MYBROTHER'S KEEPER INITIATIVE
WHICH ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THISVIOLENCE, ALONG WITH THE
COUNTLESS VIGILS AND MARCHESWITHIN THESE VIOLENCE TORN
COMMUNITIES MEANS THEY ARETRYING ACTUALLY TO DO SOMETHING.
YOU SEE, YOU BEING IGNORANT OFTHOSE ATTEMPTS DOESN'T MEAN
THE ISSUE ITSELF IS BEINGIGNORED IN THE SAME WAY THAT
WHEN IT SNOWS WHEREYOU LIVE DOESN'T MEAN THE WORLD
ISN'T GETTING HOTTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: [BLEEP]. OH, YOU KNOWWHAT? THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
BOTHERING YOU, ISN'T THERE?
>> WHEN A COP PULLS ME OVER ISAY, I PUT MY HANDS OUTSIDE OF
THE CAR. IF I'M CARRYING AWEAPON, WHICH I'M LICENSED TO
CARRY IN NEW YORK, THE FIRSTTHING I TELL THE POLICE OFFICER
IS "OFFICER I WANT YOU TO KNOW IHAVE A LEGAL FAREARM IN THE
CAR."
>> Jon: AND THEN I BRACE MYSELFFOR THE TASER.
WELL, WITHOUT GETTING INTO THEFACT YOU GET PULLED OVER SO MUCH
BY THE COPS THAT SOMETIMESYOU'RE CARRYING A WEAPON.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT. I DON'TKNOW.
DEPENDS ON HOW I'M FEELING THATDAY.
BUT, CONTINUE.
>> I OFTEN WOULD EVEN TAKE MY --STEP OUT OF THE CAR, LIFT MY
SHIRT UP SO HE COULDSEE WHERE THE GUN IS.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: YOU REALLY DO HAVE NO
[BEEP] IDEA, DO YOU?
YOU REALLY DON'T. BASICALLY,
BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING...[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IF ONLY MICHAEL BROWN INSTEAD OFHOLDING
HIS HANDS OVER HIS HEAD HADREACHED DOWN TO HIS WAIST ND
LIFTED UP HIS SHIRT TO SHOW THEGUN HE DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE,
WELL, THIS WHOLE TRAGEDY COULDOF BEEN AVOIDED.
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LIFEIN THIS COUNTRY IS INHERENTLY
DIFFERENT FOR WHITE PEOPLE ANDBLACK PEOPLE?
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYINGMAKE THIS, DANA, ABOUT BLACK AND
WHITE. AND TRYING TO MAKE THISABOUT RACE.
>> THIS IS PART OF THIS EFFORTTO MAKE IT EVERYTHING ABOUT
RACE.
>> IS THIS A STORY ABOUT RACE?DO WE KNOW THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S PLACING THE RACECARD.
AND I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL.
>> THE ONLY RACIAL DIVIDE THATIS BEING CREATED HERE IS
BEING CREATED BYTHE RACE HATERS.
>> YOU KNOW WHO TALKS ABOUTRACE, RACISTS.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: DID YOU JUST -- HE WHO
SMELT IT DEALT IT RACISM.
DID YOU REALLY? YOU SMELT ITDEALT IT RACISM?
ALRIGHT.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: FORGET THAT IN
FERGUSON, 94% OF THE POLICE AREWHITE AND 63% OF THE PEOPLE ARE
BLACK, FORGET THAT 92% OFPOLICE SEARCHES AND 86% OF CAR
STOPS ARE FOR BLACK PEOPLE.FORGET THAT THE WHITE MUNICIPAL
GOVERNMENT FINANCES NEARLY AQUARTER OF ITS ANNUAL BUDGET
THROUGH THE FINESDISPROPORTIONATELY LEVELED
AGAINST THE BLACK POPULATION.FORGET THAT THE HISTORY OF THIS
TOWN INCLUDES THIS TASTY NUGGET.
>> A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN NAMED HENRYDAVIS SAID THAT FOUR FERGUSON
POLICE OFFICERS BEAT HIM ANDTHEN CHARGED HIM WITH DAMAGING
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY BECAUSE HISBLOOD HAD GOTTEN ON THE
OFFICERS' UNIFORMS.
>> Jon: SO, LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT. YOU GUYS
HAVE GOT TANKS BUT YOU CAN'TKEEP A COUPLE OF TIDE STICKS
AROUND. BECAUSE HERE'S...
HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITHEVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON IN
THIS CONVERSATION.
THIS ISN'T ALL ABOUT JUS ONEMAN KILLED IN ONE TOWN.
IT'S ABOUT HOW PEOPLE OF COLOR,NO MATTER THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC
STANDING FACE OBSTACLES IN THISCOUNTRY WITH SURPRISING GRACE.
LOOK AT, LOOK AT HOW UPSET YOUALL GET ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS.
>> TONIGHT CHRISTMAS UNDERATTACK.
>> Jon: WHY ARE WE ALLOWINGANTI- CHRISTMAS MADNESS?
>> WHY DO I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUNDWITH MY KIDS TO LOOK FOR
NATIVITY SCENES AND BE LIKE,
OH YA, KIDS, LOOK THERE BABYJESUS BEHIND THE FESTIVUS POLE
MADE OUT OF BEER CANS.
IT'S NUTS!>> REMEMBER...
>> Jon: REMEMBER, YOU WEREFURIOUS THAT AMERICA'S
11 MONTH LONG CELEBRATION OFCHRISTMAS WASN'T ENOUGH. BUT
NOW IF YOU CAN, JUST IMAGINETHAT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SUFFER
THE INDIGNITY OF A FESTIVUS POLEBLOCKING SOMETHING YOU COULD
HAVE JUST SET UP IN YOUR OWNYARD ANYWAY -- IMAGINE THAT
INSTEAD OF THAT ON A PRETTYCONSISTENT BASIS YOU CAN'T GET A
[BEEP] CAB EVEN THOUGHYOU'RE A NEURO SURGEON,
CAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.I GUARANTEE YOU.
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT EVERY, IGUARANTEE YOU THAT EVERY, THAT
EVERY PERSON OF COLOR IN THISCOUNTRY HAS FACED AM INDIGNITY
FROM THE RIDICULOUS, TO THEGROTESQUE, TO THE SOMETIMES
FATAL AT SOME POINT INTHEIR -- I'M GONNA SAY
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS. BECAUSE OFTHEIR SKIN COLOR.

THE PREVIOUS WEEK SHADOW.
STRODE CONFIDENTIALLY INTO THEBUILDING PROCEEDING OUR HUMBLE
CORRESPONDENT, A GENTLEMAN OFCOLOR, DRESSED RESPLENDENTLY IN
