.
>> Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE VERY KIND.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WOW, THAT IS ENTHUSIASTIC.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE
LEGENDARY BILLY CRYSTAL.
I WONDER WHAT WE'LL TALK
ABOUT.
STOP IT.
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST,
STUNNING NEWS OUT OF
WASHINGTON D.C.
>> IT'S OFFICIAL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SEEK A
SECOND TERM IN 2012.
>> Jon: HE'S NOT BREAKING UP
WITH US.
HE WANTS TO WORK THINGS OUT.
ALTHOUGH HE'S A MUSLIM WHO WAS
BORN IN TANS KNEE I CAN'T, OUR
POOR RECORD ON INCESSANT
DEMANDS TO BE TALKED TO EVERY
TIME WE GO TO WAR.
HE'S DECIDED THAT WITH ALL OUR
FAULTS, HE STILL LOVES US.
IN FACT, HE'S RELEASED HIS
FIRST CAMPAIGN VIDEO OF 2012.
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO IT
STARS.
"TIME" MAGAZINE'S 2006 PERSON
OF THE YEAR.
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH OBAMA ON
EVERYTHING.
BUT I RESPECT HIM AND I TRUST
HIM.
>> THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
THAT ARE STILL ON THE TABLE
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.
WE WANT THEM TO BE ADDRESSED
BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Jon: I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY
LIKE HIM.
I DON'T REALLY TRUST HIM BUT
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
LEARN SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW.
THOSE ARE THE BEST SUPPORTERS
YOU COME UP WITH FOR YOUR
OPENING CAMPAIGN VIDEO?
THEY'RE ALL EXHAUSTED.
HOW DID WE GO FROM "YES, WE
CAN" TO "YOU KNOW, WHATEVER"?
WELL, PERHAPS THE ENNUI-- THE
ENNUI-- IS A NATURAL RESULT OF
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CAMPAIGN
PROMISES ARE EXPOSED TO
OXYGEN.
CASE IN POINT.
>> I WANT TO CREATE A WHITE
HOUSE THAT IS MORE TRANSPARENT
AND ACCOUNTABLE THAN ANY
GOVERNMENT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.
>> Jon: OF COURSE YOU DID.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO
(BEEP) GLAZED DONUTS.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
APPARENTLY THE AUDIENCE IS
HUNGRY.
BUT AS WE BOTH LEARNED OVER
THESE PAST TWO YEARS, IT'S
HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.
SEE, WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING FOR
THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU WANTED TO
LOOK AT WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE
WAS HIDING.
NOW YOU LIVE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE AND YOU WANT EVERYONE TO
STOP BEING SO (BEEP) NOSEY.
WHEN YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE
WHITE HOUSE, YOU WANT IT TO BE
DISINFECTED.
WHEN YOU LIVE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, DISINFECTANT STINGS.
THIS ADMINISTRATION PROSECUTED
MORE WHISTLE BLOWERS IN THE
LAST TWO YEARS, THAT MEETS
WITH LOBBYISTS ACROSS THE
STREET FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SO
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE
THEIR MEETING WITH LOBBYISTS
AND THIS IS TRUE CENSORED
NEARLY 200 PAGES OF INTERNAL
EMAILS ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO
MAKE THE GOVERNMENT MORE
TRANSPARENT.
UNLESS THEY'RE HIDING THE FACT
THAT THEY'VE MADE GOVERNMENT
COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT BECAUSE
THEY WANTED TO SURPRISE US.
HOW WEIRD HAS THIS
ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD ON
TRANSPARENCY GOTTEN?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA RECEIVED AN
AWARD FOR TRANSPARENCY MONDAY.
>> THAT MEETING WAS COMPLETELY
CLOSED TO MEMBERS OF THE MEADE
MEDIA.
>> THEY NOT ONLY CLOSED THE
MEETING TO THE MEDIA THEY
DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT IN THE
PRESIDENT'S PUBLIC SCHEDULE.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATULATIONS.
TRANSPARENCY AWARD.
CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING THE
COVETED "TRANNY."
OF COURSE, THE WHITE HOUSE DID
RELEASE A PHOTO OF THE AWARD.
OH, THAT'S NOT... ALL RIGHT.
PROBABLY NICE.
IT WILL LOOK REALLY GOOD IN
