WORLD.

BEST HEALTH CARE DELIVERYSYSTEM IN THE WORLD.
>> FOX BUSINESS COMMENTATORTODD WILEMAN.
>> THE U.S. HEALTHCARESYSTEM IS THE BEST IN THE
WORLD BUT NOW WITH OBAMACARE,YOU KNOW, OUR CHOICES HAVE
BEEN LIMITED.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GOINGTO BE SAYING THIS COSTS MORE,
I'M GETTING LESS, I'M NOTGOING TO BE HAPPY.
WORST-CASE SCENARIO WHEREARE WE HEADING.
>> WE HAVE LONGER LINES.
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BRING YOUROWN SHEET.
IN RUSSIA THEY REUSE SYRINGES.
THE SCENARIO WHERE WE COULDSLIP INTO THIRD WORLD STATUS
WILL BE SLOW, PROBABLY.
>> OH MY GOD, THIRD WORLDSTATUS, THAT IS LIKE THE
WORST WORLD STATUS THEREIS TO SEE HOW BAD THAT
COULD BE I TRAVELED TO AREGION RIFE WITH POVERTY.
MY GUIDE WAS STAN BROCK, FOUNDEROF REMOTE AREA MEDICAL.
>> FOR 30 YEARS BROCK ANDHIS CHARITY HAVE PARACHUTED
INTO REMOTE REGIONS OFAFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA WITH
TEAMS OF DOCTORS WORKING TOHEAL THE POOR.
AND NOW HE WOULD SHOW MEWHAT AMERICA WILL LOOK LIKE
IN JUST A FEW YEARS.
STAN, HOW HIGH ARE WE GOINGTO GO UP?
>> YOU DON'T NEED TO SCREAMAT ME.
THE ROOF IS NOT GONE YET,WE'RE STILL ON THE GROUND.
>> OH.
OH, OKAY, YEAH, YEAH, THISIS MY FIRST TIME.
>> ANXIOUS FOR THE LONGJOURNEY AHEAD WE BUZZED OVER
AN UNFAMILIAR AND RUGGEDLANDSCAPE.
>> WHEN I ARRIVED I WASOVERWHELMED BY THE NEED.
>> DO FIND THAT THERE AREDISEASES AND THINGS,
CONDITIONS HERE YOU'RE NOT EVENFAMILIAR WITH.
DENGUE FEVER, TYPHOID, MALARIA
THINGS LIKE THAT.
>> NO THOSE AREN'T PROBLEMSTHAT WE REALLY SEE IN
KNOXVILLE.
>> YOU SAID KNOXVILLE.
>> WE'RE IN TENNESSEE.
>> TENNESSEE.

>> YES.
>> KNOXVILLE.
AND THAT'S WHAT THE LOCALSCALL THIS PLACE.

>> AND WHAT IS THE ENGLISHWORD FOR IT.
>> KNOXVILLE.
>> THIS IS KNOXVILLE,TENNESSEE THIS IS AMERICA.
>> OH, THAT EXPLAINS IT.
OH MY GOD, I THINK I SAW AWAFFLEHOUSE.
>> BUT IF WE WERE IN AMERICA,WHAT THE HELL WAS STAN BROCK
DOING HERE.
>> REMOTE AREA MEDICAL HAD BEENDESIGNED TO TAKE AIRBORNE
RELIEF, PARACHUTE DROPS ETCETERA TO THE THIRD WORLD AND
NOW MORE THAN 90% OF EVERYTHINGWE DO IS HERE IN
THE UNITED STATES.
>> AND IS THAT BECAUSE 90%OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION IS
AMERICAN.
>> NO, NO, WHEN I CAME TOTHIS COUNTRY I SAW THAT THERE
WAS A DESPERATE NEED, PEOPLETHAT COULDN'T AFFORD OR
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO CARE.
>> THE U.S. HEALTHCARESYSTEM IS THE BEST IN THE
WORLD, FACT.
>> IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT.
>> NAME FIVE OTHER COUNTRIESTHAT HAVE A BETTER
HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM THAN THEU.S.
>> MALTA, CYPRUS, FRANCE,SWITZERLAND, JAPAN,
AUSTRALIA, GREAT BRITAIN.
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU NAMED LIKESEVEN.

OKAY, SO MAYBE WE'RE NOT THEFIRST BEST OR SECOND-BEST,
BUT AT LEAST WE'RE IN THETOP-- 37th.
WHATEVER.
IN YOUR FACE, SLOVENIA.
I JUST CAME BACK FROM APLACE WITH SHOCKINGLY POOR
HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS.
THEY'RE STILL REELING FROMTHE LOSS OF THE CIVIL WAR.
A QUARTER OF THE YOUNGPEOPLE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY.
THEY HAVE HIGH RATES OFCANCER.
HEART DISEASE.
>> THIS IS HOW BAD IT COULDGET, SURE, YEAH, IF WE KEEP
GOING DOWN THE PATH OF MOREGOVERNMENT CONTROL, LESS
INNOVATION.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD BETHAT PLACE UNLESS GREAT
CATASTROPHE HAPPENS TO THISCOUNTRY.
>> I SHOULD PROBABLY MENTIONTHAT THE PLACE I'M TALKING
ABOUT IS KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE,IN AMERICA.
>> WHICH HAS THE GREATESTHEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD.
>> WHAT I-- OBVIOUSLY NOT-- YOUKNOW, YOU'RE-- YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE DO FALL THROUGH THECRACKS.
>> AND FROM WHAT I SAW THOSEARE SOME PRETTY BIG [BLEEP]
CRACKS.
SO THE WORSE CASE SCENARIOFOR OBAMACARE IS THAT IT
GETS US TO A PLACE WHERE WEALREADY ARE?
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW WHENYOU'RE SICK.
>> YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GETTHE CARE.
IT'S GOING TO BE NOT-- NOTGOOD.
NOT SO MUCH NOT GOOD, IT'S NOTGOING TO BE WHAT
EVERYONE ELSE IS GETTING.
>> EVERYBODY ELSE GETS IT,IT'S GOING TO BE --
>> [BLEEP].
>> IT'S-- THEY ALL GET THESAME LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TOWAIT FOR IT.
>> IT'S THE SAME TREATMENT,YOU JUST MIGHT GET THAT
TREATMENT AFTER YOU HAVEALREADY DIED.
>> NO.
SOME PEOPLE GET GREAT HEALTHCARE AND SOME PEOPLE JUST
GET GOOD HEALTH CARE.
>> BUT WHAT IF EVERYBODY GOTREALLY GREAT HEALTH CARE.
I'M JUST KIDDING, WE HAVETO KEEP THINGS COMPETITIVE,
RIGHT?
>> YES!
>> SEE, EVERYONE GETS CARE.
IT'S JUST SOME HAVE TO WAITFOR IT.
TO BE CHOPPERED IN WITH ATRIAGE UNIT.
BUT THAT'S THEIR CHOICE.
>> NOT ALL OF THEM CANNOTAFFORD HEALTH CARE.
THEY MADE THAT CHOICE TO GOBARE.
>> BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORDIT.
>> BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANTTO PAY FOR IT.
>> WELL, BECAUSE THEY CAN'TAFFORD IT.
>> PEOPLE LIKE A FREE LUNCH.
AND I WILL BE HONEST, IF YOUARE POOR, STOP BEING POOR,
YOU KNOW, GET A GED, HAVE AJOB FOR OVER A YEAR.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> SO IF YOU ARE POOR,JUST STOP BEING POOR.
>> THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

JUST NO ONE TELL SLOVENIA.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
