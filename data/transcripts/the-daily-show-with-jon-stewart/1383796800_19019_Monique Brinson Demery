>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MYGUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR NEW
BOOK CALLED FINDING THE DRAGONLADY, THE MYSTERY OF
VIETNAM'S MADAM NHU.
PLEASE WELCOME MONIQUEBRINSON DEMERY.
HELLO!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO SAY,FINDING THE DRAGON LADY, HAS
ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKCOVER PICTURES OF ALL TIME.
THIS IS, I'M ASSUMING, HERHIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION PHOTO,
I DON'T-- WHAT IS THIS PHOTOTHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT?
>> THIS IS A GREAT PHOTO.
MADAME NHU HAD A WOMEN'S MILITIAIN SOUTH VIETNAM AND SHE WAS
OUT INSPECTING THE TROOPSMAKING SURE THEIR JACKETS
WERE FITTING RIGHT AND THEIRPANTS, BECAUSE ACTUALLY THEY
WERE VERY STYLISH, THEWOMEN'S MILITIA.
SO SHE WAS OUT THERE ANDSORT OF SHOWING OFF HER AIM.
>> Jon: HER AIM FOR THEMILITIA.
NOW HOW DID YOU-- SHE GOESINTO EXILE.
AND HOW DID YOU THINK OH,YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO, I
SHOULD CALL HER.
HOW DID THATOCCUR TO YOU?
>> WELL, THE FIRST THINGTHAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS I
NEVER SAW AN OBITUARY FORHER, SO SHE FADED FROM VIEW
BUT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE.
SO JUST BECAUSE SHE WASN'TTALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE, I
THOUGHT WELL, I COULD TRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND YOU STRUCK UP ACORRESPONDENCE WITH HER.
>> I DID.
AND WE HAD PHONECONVERSATIONS AND AT THE END
SHE EVEN E-MAILED WHICH ITHOUGHT WAS SORT OF COOL FOR
THE DRAGON LADY.
>> Jon: YEAH.
DID SHE, WAS THAT HER HANDLE,WAS THAT HER-- IS THERE AN
EMOTICON THAT HAS A LADYWITH A GUN ON IT?
>> IT WAS HER KIDS INTERNETACCOUNT THAT THEN SHE USED.
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE A GREATTWITTER NAME I'M SURE.
>> Jon: NOW SHE WAS NOT THEFIRST LADY OF SOUTH VIETNAM.
SHE WAS MARRIED TO, I GUESS,THE PRESIDENT'S BROTHER.
>> RIGHT.
SO WE CALL HER THE FIRSTLADY BECAUSE SHE WAS THE
HOSTESS, SHE WAS THEDIPLOMATIC.
>> Jon: HE WAS NOT MARRIED,THE PRESIDENT.
>> CORRECT.
HE WAS NOT MARRIED.
SO HE CHOSE FOR HIS FIRSTLADY HIS YOUNGER BROTHER'S
WIFE.
AND WHO WOULDN'T CHOOSE HER.
I MEAN SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
SHE WAS VERY ELEGANT.
AND SHE ACTUALLY WAS PRETTYASTUTE.
>> Jon: AS A POLITICAL -->> AS A POLITICIAN.
>> Jon: THEY SAY, YOU KNOW,SHE'S REALLY THE REASON THAT
KENNEDY KIND OF BACKED THECOUP, YEAH?
>> YEAH.
KENNEDY HAD A LOT OF TROUBLEWITH MADAM NHU BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
SAID THAT THE MEN IN HERFAMILY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE
BEING LED AROUND BY HERAPRON STRINGS.
AND SO HE JUST REALLY DIDN'TWANT TO LOOK LIKE AMERICA
WAS DOING THE SAME.
SO MEANWHILE HIS OWN WIFEJACKIE WAS THE PERFECT IMAGE
OF A FIRST LADY.
SHE WAS REFINED.
SHE WAS QUIET, FOR THE MOSTPART.
AND MADAME NHU WASEVERYTHING-- ACCORDING TO
JACKIE, SHE WAS EVERYTHINGTHAT JACK FOUND
UNATTRACTIVE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
WELL-- A LADY WITH A GUN.
FOR JACK KENNEDY THAT'S APROBLEM.
BUT IN MANY RESPECTS, YOUKNOW, THAT DECISION IS WHAT
SORT OF LED TO THECOMMUNISTS COMING INTO
VIETNAM WHICH THEN LED TO IGUESS YOU COULD SAY
ULTIMATELY THE MOVIE"FORREST GUMP" BEATING "PULP
FICTION" AT THE OSCARS WHICHI THINK WE ALL AGREE WAS THE
REAL TRAGEDY OF THIS ENTIREDEBACLE.
WAS SHE IN ANY WAY STILLFRIGHTENED?
WAS SHE PARANOID THAT FORCESWERE GOING TO BE OUT TO GET
HER?
>> SURE.
SO BY THE TIME I FOUND HER,I HAD TO SWEAR UP AND DOWN
THAT I WAS NOT A GOVERNMENTAGENT.
I WAS NOT MARRIED TO AGOVERNMENT AGENT.
NO ONE IN MY FAMILY BELONGEDTO THE CIA.
AND SHE REALLY DIDN'T TRUSTME AT FIRST.
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.
SHE HAD BEEN BURNED BEFORE.
SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME TOEARN HER TRUST.
>> Jon: AND YOU HAD SET UPMANY DIFFERENT MEETINGS WITH
HER.
YOU WENT TO PARIS THIS YEAR.
BUT SHE NEVER ACTUALLY SHOWSUP.
>> NO.
SHE DOESN'T.
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY ITHINK SHE LIKES TO THINK OF
HERSELF AS THIS POWERFUL,BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
AND SO FOR HER TO SHOWHERSELF AS SORT OF AN OLDER
WOMAN, DIMINISHED, FORGOTTENBY EVERYBODY BUT ME, I THINK
WOULD HAVE BEEN A HARD EGOTHING.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
AND WAS THERE EVER A POINTIN YOUR MIND WHERE YOU
THOUGHT OH, I'M BEINGCATFISHED HERE.
THIS IS PROBABLY THAT-- THISIS PROBABLY THAT TOUIASOSOPO GUY
THAT GOT MANTI T'EO. I MEAN HOW DID YOU IN YOUR
MIND GET THIS SO THAT YOUVERIFIED THAT IT WAS REALLY
HER?
>> I HAD TO LISTEN A LOT OFHER CONVERSATIONS.
AND THEY WOULD MEANDER.
AND I WOULD GO ALONG.
SOMETIMES WONDERING WHERE WEWOULD END UP.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IWENT THROUGH THE ARCHIVES IN
D.C. AND IN FRANCE AND ISPOKE TO A LOT OF HER
COLLEAGUES, PEOPLE WHO HATEDHER AT THE TIME AND WERE
WRITING AGAINST HER.
AND THE STORIES MATCH UP.
IT WAS DEFINITELY HER THAT IWAS TALKING TO.
>> Jon: AND SHE ALSO HAD HERMEMOIRS THAT SHE WANTED TO
GET OUT THERE.
>> SHE DID.
SHE HAD TWO VOLUMES OFSEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES, WHICH
WERE REALLY PIECES OF THEMWERE REALLY ENLIGHTENING.
AND THE OTHER PARTS WEREBIBLICAL, SORT OF SCRIPTURE,
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THEUNIVERSE TYPE OF WRITING.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> REALLY.
>> Jon: LIKE KIND OF DUNGEONSAND DRAGONS TEENAGER TYPE
STUFF OR WHAT IF WE'RE ALLJUST MARBLES FLOATING AND
AND-- THAT SORT OFPHILOSOPHY.
>> MORE LIKE PREDESTINED,THIS LIFE WAS CHOSEN FOR ME.
>> Jon: OH, REALLY.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO SHE WAS FATALLISTICABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.
>> MARTYRED, YEAH.
>> Jon: DID SHE HAVE ANYSELF-AWARENESS OF, YOU KNOW
SHE WAS NOT A NICE PERSON.
THE BUDDHIST MONKS WOULDIMMOLATE IN VIETNAM IN
PROTEST AND SHE WOULD SAYLET THEM BURN, YOU KNOW, SHE
WAS KIND OF A TERRIBLEPERSON.
>> THE BARBECUE COMMENT.
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
>> SHE DID EXPRESS ONEREGRET AND THE REGRET WAS
THAT SHE HADN'T BEEN MOREHUMBLE.
IN OTHER WORDS, NOT THAT SHEWAS WRONG, BUT THAT SHE
SHOULD HAVE ACTED A LITTLEBIT LESS LOUDLY ABOUT HER
ACHIEVEMENTS.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD.
I HAVE ONE REGRET.
I DIDN'T TRY TO HIDE MYAWESOMENESS.
LOVE IT A FASCINATING STORY.
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS,BOY, IT TAKES ONE PERSON'S
CURIOSITY TO BRING TO LIFE ASTORY THAT OTHERWISE I THINK
WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY.
AND ONE THAT I THINK ITWOULD HAVE BEEN SAD IF THIS
HAD NEVER COME TO LIGHT SO ITHINK IT'S WONDERFUL SO
THANK YOU FOR DOING IT.
THE BOOK IS FINDING THEDRAGON LADY.
IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVESNOW.
