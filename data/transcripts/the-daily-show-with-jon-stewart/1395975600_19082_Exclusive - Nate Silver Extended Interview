[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FOUNDERAND EDITOR IN CHIEF OF
FIVETHIRTYEIGHT.COM.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM NATE SILVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
>> PRETTY GOOD, JON.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
>> Jon: I'M VERY WELL.
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE LAUNCHOF NEW FIVETHIRTYEIGHT.
>> WE LAUNCHED THIS WEB SITE AWEEK AND A HALF AGO.
IT'S 20 OF US A VERY YOUNG TEAM.IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT TO
LAUNCH AND THEN WE REALIZEDOH, [bleep] WE HAVE TO PUBLISHIT
EVERY DAY.
SO IT'S A LOT OF WORK. WE'REGETTING BETTER.
>> Jon: SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYINGIT'S BEEN UP LIVE FOR A WEEK AND
A HALF AND IT'SSTILL NOT PERFECT.
>> IT'S NOT PERFECT YET.
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO PERFECT IDON'T THINK.
>> Jon: WELL, WELL LOOKS LIKETHE SHINE IS OFF THE APPLE ISN'T
IT SILVER.
>> HERE IS THE THING.
MAYBE DUE TO PROGRAMS LIKE THISTHERE WAS A LOT OF HYPE ABOUT ME
AND FIVETHIRTYEIGHT. AND THETHING IS --
>> Jon: I CALLED YOU THE LORDOF THE ALGORITHM.
>> YEAH THAT WAS USEFUL FOR BOOKSALES AT THE TIME BUT RIGHT
NOW IT KINDA SETS A VERY HIGHBAR.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND. YOU ARETAKING A RASH OF [bleep] IN AWEEK
AND A HALF LIKE NOBODY I'VESEEN IN A LONG TIME.
YOUR STATISTICAL ANALYSISOF THE 2012 ELECTION WAS QUITE
ACCURATE AND THEN YOUHAVE PREDICTED IN THIS RECENTMID TERM THAT THERE'S
A 60% CHANCE THAT THE DEMOCRATSWILL LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE
AND THE DEMOCRATS WERE LIKETHOSE LITTLE BALLOONS OUTSIDE OF
CAR DEALERSHIPS THEY ARE JUSTBLARRRRGH.
>> THEY ARE SENDING MEMOS OUT TOTHE PRESS ON THE ONE HAND BUT
THEN THEY'RE ALSO SENDINGFUND-RAISING E-MAILS
LIKE PROVE NATE SILVER WRONG. ALOT OF PEOPLE
ESPECIALLY IN POLITICS THEY LIKETHE MATH PART OF THINGS WHEN IT
TELLS THEM WHAT THEY ALREADYBELIEVE. IT'S HARD. IT'S A
COMPLICATED WORLD TO FIGURE OUTSOMETIMES.
AND I'M NOT SAYINGTHAT WE HAVE ALL THE
ANSWERS BY ANY MEANS AT ALL.OBJECTIVITY.
>> Jon: I AM SAYING THAT THOUGH.
>> I KNOW. WELL WE WILL PROVEYOU WRONG.
WE'LL PROVE OURSELVES WRONG ANDPROVE YOU WRONG IN THE PROCESS.
>> Jon: BUT HERE'S WHAT ILIKE ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST -- YOU
HAVE THIS ONE GUY ON. HE IS APOLITICAL SCIENTIST.
HE WRITES  AN ARTICLE.
AT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OFCLIMATE SCIENCE.
AND IT CREATES A HUGE HULABALOOBECAUSE HE'S SAYING THE DAMAGE
CAUSED BY THESE STORMS IS NOTINCREASING IT'S JUSTTHAT WE ARE WEALTHY.
>> WELL THAT'S A PIECE WHERE WEHAD A LOT OF CONCERN FROM
OUR READERS. SO WE DON'T PAYATTENTION TO A LOT OF
WHAT MEDIA CRITICS SAY, BUT THATWAS A PIECE WHERE
WE HAD 80% OF COMMENTATORSWEIGHED IN NEGATIVELY.
SO WE'RE COMMISSIONING AREBUTTAL TO THAT PIECE.
WE LISTEN TO FEEDBACK FROM THEPEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY GIVE US OUR
LEGS AND THAT WE HAVE -->> Jon: SO YOU ARE RESPONDING TO
CRITICISM AND ATTEMPTING TOIMPROVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THEMEDIA WORLD, MY FRIEND.
[LAUGHTER]>> LOOK WE RUB SOME ELBOWS TOO.
>> STICK TO WHAT YOU SAY.
>> WE RESPOND TO SERIOUSCRITICISM THE ONLY WAY WE CAN
WHICH IS TO PUT OUT A BETTERPRODUCT.
IF THERE'S CRITICISM WE THINK ISA LITTLE MORE FRIVOLOUS WE MIGHT
RESPOND WITH HUMOR ORIGNORE IT OR SNARK OR WHATEVERELSE.
>> Jon: LIKE THE WAY PAULKRUGMAN HAD BEEN A CRITIC OFWHAT YOU
ARE DOING AND YOU PUT I THOUGHTA VERY FUNNY PIECE STATISTICALLY
ANALYZING THE MENTIONS OF YOURBLOG OF MR. KRUGMAN, YOUR OLD
BLOG VERSUS THE NEW BLOG.
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
>> THE SATIRE WAS MEANT TO BE ASTEREOTYPE OF BAD DATA ANALYSIS
BASICALLY.
WHEN WE STARTED A WEEK AND AHALF AGO.
I TOLD MY TEAM YOU ARE IN THEBIG LEAGUES NOW.
THE INTERNET IS KIND OF A CRAZYPLACE SOMETIMES.
THEY ARE ALL BRUSHINGEVERYTHING OFF THEIR SHOULDERS
REALLY WELL. MEANWHILEI'M THERE ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M
MANAGING A STAFF OF 20 PEOPLEAND IT'S LIKE SOMEONE IS KINDA
THROWING APPLES AT YOUR KIDS ORSOMETHING.
>> Jon: HEAVY IS HEAD THATWEARS THE CROWN SILVER.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHY I WEAR THEJESTER'S CROWN IT'S MADE OF
FELT, MUCH LIGHTER.
[LAUGHTER]HERE IS WHY I THINK YOUR SITE IS
IMPORTANT.
STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS AREPUNDIT FUEL.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND IF YOUR SITE, IFTHE PURPOSE OF YOUR SITE COULD
BE TO REFINE, TO HELP VET THETYPE OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OR
THE TYPE OF NUMBERS THAT THESEPUNDITS USE AS THEIR FUEL THAT
IS AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLERESOURCE.
BECAUSE PART OF DIFFICULTY OFANALYZING THINGS BASED ON
NUMBERS IS YOU DON'T REALLYKNOW
THE EFFICACY OF MANY OF THESESTATISTICAL
STUDIES, NO?
>> YEAH WE'RE SAYING LOOK WE'REJUST TRYING TO BE RIGHT A LITTLE
BIT MORE OFTEN, RIGHT. IT'S ACOMPLICATED PLACE. SO, FOR
EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A PIECECOMING OUT BY A WONDERFUL
YOUNG ECONOMISTNAMED EMILY OSTER.
WHO'S LOOKING AT STUDIES A STUDYTHAT CAME OUT THAT SAID
ACTUALLY OBESITY IS DECREASINGAMONG 2-TO-4 YEARS OLDS, ORSOMETHING
>> Jon: I HEARD THAT ON THE
RADIO, THEY SAID THAT.
>> IT GOES AGAINST THOUSANDS OFSTUDIES TO THE CONTRARY.
IF YOU ARE DRAWING A LOTTERYBALLS BY TAKING DIFFERENT
POPULATION SAMPLESYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
SOMETHING THAT TURNSOUT DIFFERENTLY.
JUST LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO POLLANALYSIS PEOPLE TAKE THE
OUTLIER AND THINK IT REPRESENTSTHE NEW TREND. SO WE'RE TRYING
TO PROVIDE SOME SANITY ANDSOMETIMES THE STUFF WE DO IS
DRY. IT'S LIKE ACTUALLY WEDIDN'T LEARN THAT MUCH FROM THIS
POLL OR THIS STUDY. SO ABOUTSERIOUS TOPICS LIKE
CHILDHOOD OBESITY WE MIGHTHAVE A VERY SOBER OUTLOOK.
WE ALSO HAVE FUN WITH THINGSLIKE BURRITOS. WE'RE RUNNING A
PROJECT SOON TO TELL YOUWHERE TO FIND THE BEST
BURRITO IN AMERICA. YOU KNOW WEHAVE FUN WITH FUN THINGS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT ISINTERESTING IS REALLY THE TWO OF
THOSE ARTICLES TOGETHER COULDIN SOME WAYS COUNTERACT.
YOU MAY HAVE FOUND ONE COMINGTHIS WAY, ONE COMING -- AND YOU
JUST GO INTO A VOID BECAUSE ABURRITO ARTICLE FOLLOWINGTHE
OBESITY ARTICLE.
VERY SHREWD MR. SILVER.
STICK AROUND I WANT TO ASK YOU ACOUPLE OF QUESTIONS.
>> COOL. THANK YOU.
>> Jon: AND THEY WILL BEVICIOUS.
NATE SILVER, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WE'RE BACK HERE WE'RE DISCUSSING
SOME THINGS WITH NATE SILVER.
HE HAS A NEW WEB SITEFIVETHIRTYEIGHT.COM IT'S THE
SAME NAME AS YOUR OLD WEBSITEBUT IT HAS EXPANDED CONTENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. SO WE HAVE FIVEMAJOR VERTICALS.
SPORTS, POLITICS, ECONOMICS,SCIENCE AND LIFESTYLE
OF COURSE EVERYTHING IN THEWORLD IS AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE
THINGS IF NOT MORE.
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT WE WANT TOTRY AND FIND THINGS WHERE OUR
SKILL SET MEANING STATISTICS,COMPUTER PROGRAMMING WE STILL DO
SOME REAL REPORTING.
WE'RE NOT AGAINST REPORTING.
WE'RE AGAINST PUNDITRY.
SO IT'S A MIX OF SKILLS WE'RETRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST
TO -->> Jon: PEOPLE HAVE GONE AFTER
YOU AS THOUGH YOU HAVE SAIDYOURSELF THIS IS THE HOLY GRAIL
OF ANSWERS.
AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD YOU --YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY HUMBLE
ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OFDATA ANALYSIS.
>> THAT'S KIND OF POINT OF MYBOOK.
ACTUALLY THE STUFF IS REAL HARDBECAUSE IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE OR BIASESMIGHT BE.
OFTEN TIMES THE DATA ITSELF IS AVERY, YOU KNOW, POOR QUALITY.
A LOT OF ECONOMIC STATS WHENTHEY FIRST COME OUT AREN'T VERY
RELIABLE.
THEY GET REVISED YEARS LATERAFTER YOU'VE ALREADY MADE THE
WRONG POLICY CHANGE,FOR EXAMPLE.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU FINDTRUSTED SOURCES OF NUMERICAL
INFORMATION?
DO YOU HAVE GO-TOS?
HOW DO YOU FIND THEM THATHAVEN'T BEEN POLLUTED BY
IDEOLOGICAL BIAS OR BY SAMPLEBIAS OR ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF
THINGS?
>> IT'S REALLY HARD.ONE THING WE'VE CERTAINLY
LEARNED IS THAT ALL THECHALLENGES THAT ARE
REGULAR, NEWSROOM FACES WE'RENOT ABOVE AT ALL.
THEY ARE VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.
HOW DO YOU VET STORIES.
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A CASEWHERE SOMEONE DISAGREES?
I THINK OUR VIEW IS THAT THEMORE YOU SHOW THE READER INSTEAD
OF TELL THEM.
SAY HERE IS MY HOMEWORK.WE PUT THINGS UP ON GITHUB AND
OTHER FILE SHARING PLACES WHERE YOU CAN SAY GO CHECK OUR WORK
>> Jon: SURE.
>> TODAY SOMEONE FOUND, FOREXAMPLE, A MINOR ERROR IN THE
NCAA TOURNAMENTPROJECTIONS RIGHT.
IF WE HADN'T PUBLISHED THAT THEERROR WOULD HAVE EXISTED OUT
THERE AND NO ONEWOULD HAVE KNOWN.
SO THAT'S WHATWE'RE MOVING TOWARD, I GUESS THE
IDEA BEING TRANSPARENCY ISTHE NEW OBJECTIVITY.
>> Jon: I'VE FOUND THERE'SNOTHING AND I THINK THE AUDIENCE
WILL VET THIS AND THERE'SNOTHING THAT MY AUDIENCE LIKES
BETTER THAN WATCHING SOMEONE DOTHEIR HOMEWORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> IT'S PEOPLE LIKE THAT KIND OF
ARTICLE ON GITHUB.
>> Jon: NOW WHAT IS GITHUB?
I FEEL BADLY THAT I'M THAT OUTOF TOUCH THAT I DON'T KNOW
GITHUB BECAUSE KNOW I FEEL LIKEIT'S SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW.
>> IT'S LIKE FACEBOOK FORUBER-NERDS BASICALLY.
IT'S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE SHARECODE AND DATA.
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE INDATA JOURNALISM AND COMPUTERASSISTED
REPORTING.
>> Jon: SO IT'S LIKE TINDER FORNEO. IT WOULD BE,
YOU WOULD LOOK AND SEE 0111SWIPE TO THE RIGHT.
>> THAT'S THE RIGHT S.A.T.
ANALOGY.
>> Jon: 01011 SWIPE TO THELEFT.
DO YOU FIND THAT IN GENERAL THEPEOPLE THAT USE THIS FOR
POLITICAL PURPOSES WANT TOCO-OPT WHAT YOU DO AND
THEY'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING THATTHE METHODOLOGY YOU APPLY
IS CONSISTENT.
>> SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WEREKINDA BLUFFING LIKE OH HE'S
REALLY A DEMOCRAT IN DISGUISEAND NOT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE
POLLS POINT TOWARD SO PEOPLE ARELEARNING THIS YEAR LIKE IN
2010 IT'S LIABLE TO BE ATOUGH YEAR FOR DEMOCRATS.
BUT I DO THINK IT'S HARD INPOLITICS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE
PEOPLE, I ADMIRE POLITICALPASSION, I ADMIRE PEOPLE
WHO ARE WORKING IN THEIR MIND TOMAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
IT'S VERY HARD TO PUT YOURBELIEFS AHEAD OF WHERE THE
EVIDENCE COME IN -- I MEANOBJECTIVITY IS A REALLY HARDTHING
I THINK A LOT OF NEWS ROOMS HAVEKINDA SAID WE'RE JUST
GOING TO REPORT WHAT THEY SAYAND WHAT THEY SAY BECAUSE IT'S
TOO HARD TO KNOW WHAT THEWORLD LOOKS LIKE.
>> Jon: IT ALSO, YOU KNOW, ITBEGINS TO RESEMBLE AN IDEA
THAT THE NEWS ROOM HASABDICATED ANY SENSE OF
EDITORIAL AUTHORITY.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- I READ ANARTICLE TODAY.
THERE WERE 10600 PUBLISHEDCLIMATE STUDIES, 10598 OF THEM
AGREED THAT GLOBAL WARMINGIS REAL AND HUMANS HAVE A
ROLE TO PLAY IN THAT.
TWO DIDN'T.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: STATISTICALLYIT'S INSIGNIFICANT BUT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THATARGUMENT
PLAYS OUT IN THE NEWS MEDIAWOULD YOU THINK IT'S A MUCH
CLOSER BATTLE.
>> WHAT IS DIFFICULT I THINK ISPEOPLE HAVE THE FRAME WHERE IT'S
EITHER 50-50 OR 100-0.
A LOT OF TRUTHS MIGHT BE 75-25OR 98-2 OR 83-17.
YOU KNOW, TO DESCRIBE THAT ASVERY CHALLENGING TO DESCRIBE
PROBABLISTIC THINGS IS VERY HARDTO SAY THEY ARE MOSTLY RIGHT BUT
HERE ARE SOME CAVEATS THAT FORTHE INTEREST OF COMPLETENESS WE
OUGHT TO SAY AND FIGURING OUTHOW TO TOE THAT LINE BUT ALSO
HAVING A WEB SITE THATAPPEALS TO REGULAR PEOPLE. THAT
IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO NEEDMORE REPS AND MORE PRACTICE.
>> Jon: THE MORE YOU WATCH THENEWS MEDIA AND THE MORE THEY
BREAK THINGS DOWN IS THAT GOODOR IS THAT BAD.
TRYING TO BRING TO YOU WELL ITCAN BE PERHAPS MORE THEMAJORITY
GOOD BUT THERE'SSTILL A DOWNSIDE IS A DIFFICULTPLACE TO BE.
>> I THINK IT'S ALSO WHY WHEN WEHAVE A MORE COMPLETE BODY OF
WORK FOR PEOPLE TO SEE, RIGHT.
>> Jon: IT'S BEEN A WEEK AND AHALF, NATE.
I THINK WE KNOW.
>> THIS FIRST ARTICLE ON CLIMATECHANGE IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF
EVERY ARTICLE OF WHAT WE HOPEWILL BE HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES YOU
WOULD SEE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGEOVERALL ON THE SITE.
THERE'S AN IRONY IN THAT
I HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF [bleep] TOPEOPLE OVER THE YEARS.
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THIS COMING.
THERE'S A IRONY IN WHATWE SAY ABOUT PUNDITS AS WELL,THEY
KINDA CHERRY PICK FACTS AND RUSHTO JUDGMENT AND YOU SEE A
LITTLE OF THAT AS WELL BUTTHERE'S TERRIFIC STUFF ON THESITE.
>> Jon: I'M ENJOYING IT.
IT THINK IT LOOKS GREAT.
THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY YOURARTICLE ON THE DUKE LOSS TO
MERCER BEING WORSE THAN THE LOSSTO LEHIGH LET'S FACE FACTS
THAT RIDICULOUS. YOU'RE NOTTAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LOSS OF
THE PLUMLEES. THERE'SA HEART THERE.
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING.
YOU REALLY THINK THE DUKE LOSSTO MERCER WAS WORSE THAN THE ONE
TO LEHIGH.
>> OUR MANAGING EDITOR HAS ASTUDENT AT DUKE RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE HAVING A VERY IMPORTANTMEETING AND HE BROKE DOWN.
MIKE IS BACKSTAGE.
>> YEAH IT'S NOT TRUE.
THE WON TO LEHIGH IT WAS A LOTWORSE.
[LAUGHTER]NATE SILVER.
