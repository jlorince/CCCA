MY NAME IS JON STEWART, BIGSHOW, ROBIN WILLIAMS GOING
TO BE JOINING US, BUT FIRST,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE BE ON THE CUSP OF A SEACHANGE IN U.S. IRANIAN
RELATION.
>> IRAN'S NEW PRESIDENTHASAN ROUHANI TOUCHED DOWN
IN NEW YORK.
>> ROUHANI WAS ELECTED INJUNE AS A MODERATE CANDIDATE
WHO ADVOCATED IMPROVINGRELATIONS WITH THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
>> Jon: ROUHANI IS AMODERATE AS WELL AS AN
ACCOMPLISHED MANDYPATINKIN IMPERSONATOR.
GONE ARE THE DAYS OFAHMADINEJAD AND THE HARMFUL
STEREOTYPE OF THE CRAZYAMERICA-HATING ANTI-SEMITIC
MEMBERS ONLY JACKET WEARINGIRANIAN PRESIDENT.
BUT HOW DIFFERENT CAN THISROUHANI GUY BE.
>> THOUGH IRAN USUALLYBLOCKS IRANIANS FROM TWITTER,
NOW ROUHANI IS TWEETING.
>> THE SURPRISING ANDUNPRECEDENTED OUTREACH THAT
BEGAN WITH ANOTHER TWEET TWOWEEKS AGO WISHING THE
WORLD'S JEWS A HAPPY ROSHHASHANAH HOLIDAY.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT
COMING.
WELL THAT IS DIFFERENT,FINALLY IRAN HAS REACHED THE
SAME LEVEL OF TOLERANCE ASYOUR LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP.
NOT THAT ROUHANI'S WIPED THEWHOLE SLATE CLEAN.
>> LET ME ASK YOU, PRESIDENTAHMADINEJAD SAID THE
HOLOCAUST IS A MYTH.
DO YOU AGREE?
>> I'M NOT A HISTORIAN, I'M APOLITICIAN.
>> Jon: MISSED IT BY THATMUCH.
HERE'S A TIP ON THE PLAYINGOF THE I'M NOT A HISTORIAN
CARD.
IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU,PRESIDENT ROUHANI, DO YOU
THINK THE SMOOT HAWLEYTARIFF CONTRIBUTED TO THE
LENGTH OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
YOU CAN BRING OUT I'M NOTA HISTORIAN.
BUT WHEN THE QUESTION IS WASTHE HOLOCAUST REAL, I
BELIEVE THE PROPER RESPONSETO THAT WOULD BE [BLEEP]
YEAH, YEAH, IT WAS REAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT, FORGET THEHOLOCAUST, THAT CAME OUT
WRONG.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT, WHAT I MEAN TO
SAY IS PERHAPS WITH ROUHANIAND OBAMA BOTH IN TOWN FOR
THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLYOUR NATIONS CAN REACH SOME
SORT OF DETANTE, APERSIASTROIKA, IF YOU--
(LAUGHTER)PRESIDENT OBAMA, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO MAKE OUR GUEST FEELWELCOME.
>> IRANIANS HAVE LONGCOMPLAINED OF A HISTORY OF
U.S. INTERFERENCE IN THEIRAFFAIRS.
AND OF AMERICA'S ROLE INOVERTHROWING AN IRANIAN
GOVERNMENT DURING THE COLDWAR.
>> Jon: WELL, YOU CAN'TREALLY CALL IRANIANS
COMPLAINERS FOR BEING MADABOUT US OVERTHROWING THEIR
GOVERNMENT.
I MEAN ARE YOU GUYS STILLWHINING ABOUT-- THAT WAS ONE
COUP, ONE COUP!
IT'S LIKE 60 YEARS AGO.
MOVE ON DOT WHATEVS.
MAYBE ROUHANI WILL DO BETTERWITH THE CHARM OFFENSIVE.
>> THE SO-CALLED IRANIANTHREAT WHICH HAS BEEN EMPLOYED
AS AN EXCUSE TO JUSTIFYA LONG CATALOG OF CRIMES AND
CATASTROPHIC PRACTICES OVERTHE PAST THREE DECADES.
THE ARMING OF THE SADDAMHUSSEIN REGIME WITH CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, SUPPORTING THETALIBAN AND AL QAEDA ARE
JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF SUCHCATASTROPHES.
>> Jon: WE CAN GO BACK ANDFORTH ALL DAY ABOUT WHO
SUPPLIED ARMS TO SADDAMHUSSEIN AND THE TALIBAN.
MAYBE IT WAS US -- I'M NOT AHISTORIAN.
