[LAUGHTER]YOU KNOW WHAT?
CONSERVATIVES HAVE NEVER LIKEDJOHN BOEHNER THAT'S WHY THEY
PUNISHED HIM BY MAKING HIMSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR FOUR
YEARS.
YOU KNOW WHO THEY LOVE PAULRYAN.
HE WAS THE COAUTHOR OF THENEW BUDGET AGREEMENT.
TEA PARTY DARLING, FORMER VPCANDIDATE ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE
LOOKS OF A GOLDEN CHILD WHOSEFISCAL GENIUS WILL LEAD US TO
THE PROMISED LAND WHEREREAGAN WILL RISE ONCE MORE.
AND HE WILL COME AGAIN IN GLORYTO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
THOUGH REALLY FOR THE DEAD THEYARE ALREADY DEAD SO -- IT'S
REALLY FOR THE LIVING.
MY POINT IS THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]CONSERVATIVES LIKE PAUL RYAN.
>> YOU CALLED FOR MORE LEADERS.
PAUL RYAN HAS LED.
>> HE HAS LED TO MAKE ACOMPROMISE THAT SELLS OUT WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE.
>> YOU CALLED PAUL RYAN ASELLOUT.
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THAT SENATORWHO APPEARS TO HAVE JUST WOKEN
UP ON A PARK BENCH IS RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]I DIDN'T SAY PAUL RYAN WAS A
SELLOUT I JUST SAID HE SOLD OUT.
IF YOU EXCUSE ME I'M GOING TOBATHE IN THE POND AT CENTRAL
PARK.
[LAUGHTER]RYAN STOOD FAST TO HIS ETHIC OF
COMPROMISE.
>> DID YOU EVER THINK A PIECEOF LEGISLATION YOU WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR WOULD BE CALLEDNOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH?
>> IT'S A STRANGE NEW NORMAL,ISN'T IT?
GROUPS WILL DO WHAT THEY WANT TODO.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE NERDIESTVERSION OF HATERS GONNA HATE I
HAVE EVER HEARD.
GROUPS ARE GOING TO DO IT.
I BELIEVE THOSE WITH AN UNFAIRNEGATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON EVENTS
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THENEGATIVE PERSPECTIVE.
REGARDLESS AND THOSERELATIONSHIPS TAKE PRIORITIES
OVER THOSE WITH COURTESANS.
JOHN BOEHNER ISN'T CONSERVATIVEENOUGH FOR THE TEA PARTY.
WHO IS?
>> PERHAPS ANOTHER WARNING SHOTFOR THE REPUBLICAN
ESTABLISHMENT.

HAT INTO THE RING FOR NEXTYEAR'S SENATE RACE IN A PRIMARY

ROOTED OUT CROOKS.

THE GUY HAS GOTTEN HIGH MARKSFROM THE GROUPS LIKE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVEUNION, THE NATIONAL JOURNAL

ALASKA'S REPRESENTATIVE PAINTINGOF JESUS DRILLING FOR OIL.

TASTE OF THIS STEVE STOCKMANGUY.

COVERED.
>> GOOD TO KNOW.
>> NEXT TIME I CALL YOUR SHOW --[LAUGHTER]

AT THIS POINT THE ONLY GUY THATCOULD LIVE UP TO THE IDEALS IS
RONALD REAGAN HIMSELF.

WITH THREE MILLION ILLEGALS.
