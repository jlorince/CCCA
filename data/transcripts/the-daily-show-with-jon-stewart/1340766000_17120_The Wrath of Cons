( THEME SONG PLAYING )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, LORDY, LORDY, LORDY, WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST: SETH McFARLANE, THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND "FAMILY GUY."
LET ME JUST SAY THIS, IF YOU SEE ONE MOVIE THIS SUMMER WHERE A TEDDY BEAR USES A URINAL, MAKE
IT "TED." (LAUGHTER) WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH FAST AND FURIOUS, A SCANDAL WHICH AS
YOU'LL RECALL FAST AND FURIOUS WAS A PROGRAM WHERE WE ALLOWED UNTRACKABLE GUNS TO BE SENT TO
MEXICO IN AN EFFORT TO TRACK...
(LAUGHTER).
... GUNS GOING TO... IT'S THE ZANIEST SOUTH OF THE BORDER
MIXUP SINCE "THE THREE AMIGOS." (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THIS SEGMENT BROUGHT
TO YOU BY "THE THREE AMIGOS.
THE THREE AMIGOS." BECAUSE TWO AMIGOS WOULD HAVE BEEN A STUPID (BLEEP)ING MOVIE.
(LAUGHTER) THERE WERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PUNCH LINES TO THAT ONE.
LAST WEEK BROUGHT A TROUBLING NEW DEVELOPMENT TO THE FAST AND FURIOUS STORY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME ASSERTED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO SHIELD JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS DEALING WITH WHAT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE FAST AND FURIOUS SCANDAL.
>> Jon: SO THERE IT IS!
AN A.T.F. PROGRAM, DISASTROUS AND DEADLY RESULTS, STATEMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
THAT DON'T MATCH WITH PREVIOUS STATEMENTS.
AND BARACK OBAMA'S FIRST INNOVATION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
THE WHITE HOUSE ON ITS HEELS.
IT LOOKS BAD.
IT IS BAD.
REPUBLICANS WERE QUICK TO POUNCE.
>> THE DEBATE OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE
PRIVILEGE IF FAST AND FURIOUS CARRIES ECHOES OF WATERGATE.
>> I THINK HE'S MADE THIS AS BIG AS WATERGATE.
>> BIGGER THAN WATERGATE.
>> WATERGATE-LIKE ENVIRONMENT.
>> RICHARD NIXON WALKING AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE WITH A DRINK IN
HIS HAND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THE WATERGATE TAPES AWAY FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> WATERGATE LOOKS LIKE CHILD'S PLAY COMPARED TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: CHILD'S PLAY!
IT'S CHILD'S PLAY.
FAST AND FURIOUS WOULD BE LIKE IF MONICA LEWINSKY WENT DOWN ON IRAN-CONTRA DURING THE BAY OF
PIGS INVASION!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS?
(LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE, GET ME BRUCKHEIMER!
THAT WILL MAKE A COOL MOVIE.
ANYWAY, THERE'S ONLY TWO PROBLEMS WITH FAST AND FURIOUS BEING OBAMA'S WATERGATE.
I'LL LET GOVERNOR RICK PERRY EXPLAIN PROBLEM NUMBER ONE.
>> YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT: THIS IS ALMOST NIXONIAN IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NIXONIAN IN THE
COVERUP THAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS FAST AND FURIOUS.
>> KPA EXACTLY ARE YOU ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF HERE, GOVERNOR?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE ISSUE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT'S SO NIXONIAN ABOUT IT!
I DON'T KNOW!
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER HOW A CAUTIOUS GOVERNOR LIKE THIS ENDS UP EXECUTING SO MANY PEOPLE.
REALLY.
(LAUGHTER) I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY'S MANSONNIAN.
I'M SAYING IT.
IT'S O.J. SIMPSONIAN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW I JUST CAN TELL!
(LAUGHTER) AND THE SECOND PROBLEM, WHILE THE REPUBLICANSst WOULD LIKE
OUR -R OUR OUTRAGE AT THE FAST AND FURIOUS SCANDAL TO REACH THE LEVELS IT REACHED DURING
WATERGATE, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE ASKED US TO GO THERE.
>> THIS PATTERN OF LEAKS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, OF GRAVE NATIONAL SECURITY LEAKS IS
VASTLY MORE SERIOUS THAN WHAT HAPPENED AT WATERGATE.
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS SOLYNDRA DEAL.
>> THIS MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE CHILD'S PLAY MEGYN.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IN A PERCEPTION BATTLE TRYING TO TAMP DOWN THE RHETORIC LINKING THE
GULF OIL SPILL TO HURRICANE KATRINA.
>> NOT ONLY COULD THIS BE OBAMA'S KATRINA AND IT'S NOT
KATRINA YET BUT IT COULD ALSO BE OBAMA'S WATERGATE.
>>WATERGATE.
>> Jon: THAT'S FOUR WATERGATES!
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A RECORD NUMBER OF WATERGATES!
PASSING THE PREVIOUS WATERGATE RECORD HOLDER, A RICHARD NIXON...
(LAUGHTER).
WITH ONE!
THEY THROW AROUND THE TERM "WATERGATE" SO MUCH AT FOX YOU THINK THE GUY RUNNING FOX HAD
BEEN A NIXON OPERATIVE IN THE...
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S WATERGATE-GATE.
