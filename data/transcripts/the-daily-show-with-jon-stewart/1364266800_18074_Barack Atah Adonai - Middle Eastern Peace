>> Jon: TALK IS CHEAP.
WE'VE DONE THAT FOR YEARS.
CALL ME WHEN THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS
>> THE PRESIDENT ALSO SCORED A HUGE DIPLOMATIC VICTORY ON THIS TRIP TODAY.
>> Jon: WAIT.
WHAT?
DID MY EARS DECEIVE ME?
>> HE PERSONALLY HELPED ORCHESTRATE A MAJOR STEP IN HEALING THE RIFT BETWEEN TWO
CRITICAL U.S. ALLIES.
>> Jon: COULD IT BE?
WHAT WAS IT AN END TO THE SETTLE MANIES?
ROCKET-FREE TUESDAYS?
>> THE PRESIDENT PERSUADED THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO APOLOGIZE TO TURKEY
OVER MISTAKES THAT LED TO THE DEATH OF ACTIVISTS ON THE FLOTILLA.
>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
OBAMA BROKERED A PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND TURKEY, TWO COUNTRIES NO ONE KNEW WAS FIGHTING?
GEE, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH BOSNIA AND DENMARK SITUATION.
BUT FOR MORE ON THIS HISTORIC BREAKTHROUGH WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT
AASIF MANDVI.
VERY EXCITING NEWS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU ARE THERE LIVE IN THE WEST BANK.
WHAT IS THE MOOD LIKE THERE?
>> WELL, JON, PALESTINIANS HERE ARE THRILLED WITH THIS IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS PEACE
>> Jon: YES TO SEE THE HISTORIC ISRAEL-TURKEY CONFLICT FINALLY COME TO A PEACEFUL END AFTER
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF HOURS.
I MEAN, THERE ARE COUNTLESS ISRAELI AND TURKISH THREE-YEAR-OLDS WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN PEACE BETWEEN THESE TWO COUNTRIES.
I MEAN, I SPOKE TO ONE PALESTINIAN WHO SAID, "GOOD FOR TURKEY.
THEY'VE SUFFERED FOR SO LONG."
>> Jon: I HAVE TO SAY THAT'S SOMEWHAT SURPRISING
>> SORRY.
I MISREAD THAT.
THAT SHOULD HAVE READ, "OH, GOOD FOR TURKEY.
THEY'VE SUFFERED FOR SO LONG."
>> Jon: THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I IMAGINE IN THE PALESTINIAN AREAS, IN THE PALESTINIAN AREAS,
THEY'VE GOT TO BE SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS AND OBAMA'S TRIP IN GENERAL.
MAYBE FEELING NEGLECTED BY IT.
EVEN CRUSHED, THEIR SPIRITS FILLED WITH A NEVER-ENDING SORROW AND DESPAIR
>> A FEELING THEY REFER TO HERE AS TUESDAY.
>> Jon: MAYBE THEY CAN LOOK AT IT AS THE JEWS MIGHT WHICH IS THINK OF THE GREAT HOLIDAY
PALESTINIANS ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS MISERY SOME DAY.
>> YOU'RE NOT HELPING, JON Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
LOOK, THE ONLY HOPE HERE IS MAYBE SOMEHOW OBAMA FELT LIKE HE HAD TO SOLVE THE ISRAEL-TURKEY
THING BEFORE HE COULD DIG DOWN INTO THE SIX-LAYER TURK [BLEEP]
THAT IS THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS
>> Jon: VERY QUICKLY.
THE THING IN THE CENTER OF THE TURK[BLEEP] WAS THAT ULTIMATELY WHEN THEY GET THE PALESTINIAN
STATEHOOD
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY STUFFING.
BUT IF YOU GET THROUGH THAT...
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE OTHER THING.
ISRAEL COULD JUST STOP BUILDING SETTLEMENTS.
MAYBE PALESTINE STOPS LAUNCHING THE ROCKETS.
THEY NEGOTIATE A LASTING TWO-STATE SOLUTION.
>> (LAUGHING).
OH, YOU'RE CUTE, JON.
I AM GOING TO MISS YOU THIS SUMMER.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
