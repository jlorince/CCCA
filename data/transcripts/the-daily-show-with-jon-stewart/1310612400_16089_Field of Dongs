>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR MATTHEW
RICHARDSON.
HE IS AUTHOR OF A BOOK ABOUT
FANNIE MAE AND FREDDY IMAGINE
AND -- FREDDIE MAC AND WHY THE
TWO SHU NEVER HAVE GOTTEN
MARRIED.
REPUBLICAN MICHEL BACHMANN HAS
SURGED ABOVE PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS PROGROWTH
AGENDA, ADHERENCE TO THE
FOUNDING FATHERS PRINCIPLES AND
SOMETHING SPECIAL.
>> ANALYSTS SAY HER
UNCOMPROMISING VIEWS ON
HOMOSEXUALITY ARE ONE OF BIG
REASONS SHE'S GAINING TRACTION
IN IOWA.
>> Jon: WHAT?
WHY WOULD IOWANS BE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS THREE INCHES
BELOW THE CORN BELT?
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE THE IOWA SUPREME COURT
LEGALIZED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN
2009 THEY'VE NOTICED REAL
CHANGES IN THE STATE'S CASH
CROP!
[LAUGHTER]
YES, THEIR WORST FEARS CORN
DESTROYED BY A (bleep)
PLAYING.
[LAUGHTER]
A -- (bleep) PLAGUE.
MOVIE ABOUT IOWA FIELD OF -- IF
YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL -- YOU
KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S NO SURPRISING THE MESSAGE
IS RESONATING TO CONSERVATIVES
THERE.
UNLESS YOU THINK SHE'S PANDERING
REST APRIL SURED SHE'S BE ON
THIS MESSAGE FOR YEARS.
>> IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THE
GAY AND LESBIAN LIFESTYLE IT'S
BONDAGE.
IT'S PERSONAL BONDAGE, PERSONAL
DESPAIR AND ENSLAVEMENT.
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO DANGEROUS.
IT'S A SAD LIFE.
IT'S PART OF SATAN TO SAY THIS
IS GAY.
IT'S ANYTHING BUT GAY.
>> Jon: IF I WERE TO USE A
WORD FOR THEIR LIFESTYLE I'D SAY
IT WAS QUEER.
WHAT THEY TOOK THAT WORD, TOO?
OH, GOD.
THOSE (bleep).
THEY'VE GOT THAT ONE, TOO?
[LAUGHTER]
REPRESENTATIVE BACHMANN DOESN'T
JUST TALK THE TALK.
SHE AND HER HUSBAND WALK THE
WALK.
DR. BACHMANN RUNS A CHRISTIAN
COUNSELING TERM THAT PRACTICES
REPAIRA ACTIVE THERAPY OR PRAY
THE GAY AWAY.
WHY HE DENIES IT SOME FOCIALER
PATIENTS REMEMBER THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.
>> HIS PATH FOR MY THERAPY WOULD
BE TO READ THE BIBLE AND PRAY
THAT -- TO GOD THAT I WOULD NO
LONGER BE GAY.
>> IF NONE AFTER THIS WORKED,
RAMIREZ SAYS THE COUNSELOR HAD
ANOTHER IDEA.
>> HE SUGGESTED TO YOU, WHAT?
>> NOT ACTING OUT ON MY SAME-SEX
ATTRACTIONS AND LIVING A LIFE OF
SELL BASIS.
-- SELL SEL DE LA TERRE -- CELIxD
CELIBACY.
>> Jon: HE ALWAYS PRESCRIBED A
MEDICAL COCKTAIL WITH A SIDE
EFKS OF A FOUR HOUR ERECTION AND
I WASN'T GOING TO LET THAT GO
AWAY.
WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE MAN
HIMSELF DR. BACHMANN SEEN HERE
DANCING WITH HIS WIFE.
WAIT A MINUTE, CAN WE COME BACK
HERE?
THAT IS MICHELE BACHMANN'S
HUSBAND?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT IS -- THAT IS THE GUY
TEACHING PEOPLE NOT TO BE GAY?
SERIOUSLY?
IS HE -- IS THAT THE GUY --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IS HE -- IS HE TEACHING PEOPLE
NOT TO BE GAY OR IS LIKE THE
GREEN MILE GUY AND JUST
ABSORBING IT ALL?
NO, NO, I'M NOT GOING THERE.
DON'T -- DON'T GO THERE, JON.
JUST REPRESS IT.
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE FEELING A
DEEP DESIRE TO COMICALLY EXPLOIT
THE FACT THAT THIS MAN IS AN
IZOD SHIRT AWAY FROM BEING THE
GAY CHARACTER ON "MODERN
FAMILY."
OF COURSE ONE OF THEM IS JUST A
STRAIGHT MAN PRETENDING TO BE
GAY.
DON'T DO THAT, JON!
JUST BECAUSE DR. BACHMANN'S
THERAPY TO CURE GAYNESS DOES
REAL DAMAGE TO REAL PEOPLE AND
HE IS SEEMINGLY CURING THEM SO
YOU CAN HOARD ALL THE GAYNESS
FOR HIMSELF --
[LAUGHTER]
-- THAT IS NO REASON TO LET YOUR
PRIMAL URGE TO RIDICULE THIS
SEEMING HYPOCRISY OUT.
LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH, TURN IT
OFF!
THE FEELING WILL PASS.
THE FEELING -- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERYONE LOOKS GAYER WHEN THEY
ARE DANCING ANYWAY.
LET'S JUST HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO
SAY.
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN YOUR
TEENAGER SAYS SHE'S GAY?
>> THERE'S THAT CURIOSITY BUT
AGAIN WE LIKE -- YOU KNOW, IT IS
AS IF WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
BARBARIANS NEED TO BE EDUCATED.
THEY NEED BE DISCIPLINED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: REALLY?
FIRST OF ALL GAY TEENAGERS ARE
