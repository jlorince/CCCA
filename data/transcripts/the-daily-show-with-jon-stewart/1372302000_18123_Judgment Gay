BUT LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO IT
WITH THIS MORNING'S HISTORIC
NEWS.

SUPREME COURT.
DOMA, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE
ACT, RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> PROP-THE JUSTICES RULED 5-4

WOMEN ♪♪
WE DID IT!
WE DID IT.
WELL, TECHNICALLY THE SUPREME
COURT DID IT.
BUT WE WATCHED.
WE WATCHED.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE WATCHED THEM DO IT.
THIS MORNING THE SUPREME COURT
STRUCK DOWN BOTH THE DEFENSE OF
MARRIAGE ACT AND CALIFORNIA'S
PROP-8 AMENDMENT.
A HUGELY EXCITING DAY AND NOT
JUST ON THE STEPS OF THE COURT.
>> THE CAPITOL DISTRICT
HISTORICALLY GAY NEIGHBORHOOD
HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS
PREPARING FOR A HUGE CELEBRATION
BRINGING IN MUSIC AND DJs AND
CLOSING THE STREETS DOWN.

CASTRO DISTRICT, WEDNESDAY.
I GUARANTEE YOU, THERE WILL BE
PEOPLE THERE TONIGHT WHO AREN'T
SURE IF THEY'RE CELEBRATING
PROP-8 BEING REPEALED OR ENRIQUE
AGETTING BACK FROM HIS TRIP.
TODAY'S RULING WASN'T JUST A
SYMBOLIC AFFIRMATION OF GAY
PEOPLE'S DIGNITY.
IT ALSO BRINGS CONCRETE RESULTS.
>> THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FILE
JOINT TAX, FEDERAL TAX RETURNS.
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO SOCIAL
SECURITY SURVIVORS BENEFITS.
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BE INFORMED
WHEN THEIR SPOUSES ARE KILLED IN
ACTION.

STRAIGHT DUMBALS HAVE BEEN ABLE
TOEN I DO PAYING THEIR TAXES AND
LEARNING THAT THEIR SPOUSE HAS
BEEN KILLED.
NO MORE.
YOU'RE WELCOME, GAY COUPLES.
YOU ARE WELCOME.
WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE
TONIGHT.
FIRST IS A MAPT A BEE LIVE
OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT.
SAM, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT
WAS STRUCK DOWN IN A 5-4
DECISION.
WITH JUSTICE SCALIA WRITING A
BLISTERING DEFENSE.
>> YES.
BIG SURPRISE.
SCALIA WASN'T HAPPY.
HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT IT IS
INAPPROPRIATE AND ARROGANT FOR
THE COURT TO STRIKE DOWN A
DECADES-OLD CONGRESSIONAL LAW.
>> John: DIDN'T HE JUST HELP
OVERTURN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT
OF 1965 LITERALLY YESTERDAY?
>> Reporter: WELL, LIKE I SAID,
THIS IS A FIRMLY HELD BELIEF OF
SCALIA THAT HE HAS HELD FOR
APPROXIMATELY 36 HOURS NOW.
>> John: TO BE FAIR.
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
MINUTES.
>> Reporter: IN HIS DEFENSE,
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIVE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
CASES.
IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME LEGALESE,
JOHN.
HE DID NOT LIKE THE VOTING
RIGHTS ACT SO HE RULED AGAINST
IT.
BUT HE DID LIKE DOMA SO HE RULED
FOR IT.
IT'S WHAT LAWYERS CALL THE
PRINCIPLE OF (WHINING).
>> John: THANK YOU.
FOR A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE WE GO
LIVE TO AL MAD GAL.
AL, THIS RULING IS NOW JUST 12
YEARS OLD.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'M SORRY.
WHERE ARE YOU?
>> WHERE AM I?
WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU HEARD THE SUPREME COURT,
JOHN.
EVERYONE HAS TO GET GAY MARRIED.
>> John: THAT IS NOT WHAT THE
SUPREME COURT RULED.
>> YES, IT IS.
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING TO
CONSERVATIVES?
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS DEAD.
EVERYONE HAS TO GET GAY MARRIED
EFFECTIVELY IMMEDIATELY OR
OBAMA'S THUGS TAKE YOU TO JAIL.
>> John: NONE OF THAT IS GOING
TO HAPPEN.
>> Reporter: JOHN, I CAN'T TAKE
THAT RISK.
I HAVE A WIFE AND KIDS.
SO CONFUSED.
WHERE IS MY FINANCEE?
>> John: AL, AL.
THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS
WAITING.
LET'S GO.
AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
THAT SHORTS ARE WAY TOO LONG.
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE OUR ROLER
SKATES ON YET.
>> John: ARE YOU GUYS GETTING
MARRIED IN A 1980 STEREOTYPE?
>> SHUT UP.
WE'RE NEW TO THIS.
COME ON.
LET'S GO, SUGAR TITS.
>> DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT IN
FRONT OF PEOPLE.
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE
ATTITUDE.
THIS IS A [BLEEP] NIGHTMARE.
>> John: CONGRATULATIONS YOU
TWO.
