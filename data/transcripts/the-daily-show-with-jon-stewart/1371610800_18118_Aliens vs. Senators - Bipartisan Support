( cheers and applause )
>> John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
I AM JOHN OLIVER STILL -- STILL
SITTING IN FOR JON STEWART.
JON STEWART WAS OUT HIKING AND
NOW HAS HIS ARM CAUGHT UNDER A
BOULDER.
(LAUGHTER)
DON'T WORRY, WE HAVE SENT A
RESCUE TEAM TO BRING HIM A SWISS
ARMY KNIFE SO HE CAN CUT HIS ARM
OFF.
(LAUGHTER)
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, COMEDIAN AND
AUTHOR JIM GAFFIGAN IS HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE HAS A BOOK CALLED DAD IS FAT.
BUT FIRST TONIGHT CONGRESS IN
THE A THREE WAY TIE FOR LEAST
POPULAR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
HOWEVER THEY MAY BE ABOUT TO
ACCOMPLISH-- AND I KNOW IT
SOUNDS IMPROBABLE-- SOMETHING.
(LAUGHTER)
SPECIFICALLY IMMIGRATION REFORM
WHICH SUDDENLY HAS SUPPORT EVEN
FROM REPUBLICANS AND FOR ALL THE
RIGHT REASONS.
>> WE'RE IN A DEMOGRAPHIC DEATH
SPIRAL AS A PARTY AND THE ONLY
WAY WE CAN GET BACK IN THE GOOD
GRACES WITH THE HISPANIC
COMMUNITY IN MY VIEW IS
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
>> John: AND I, LINDSEY GRAHAM,
SAY TO YOU THE HISPANIC
COMMUNITY, WE CHOOSE TO HELP YOU
NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO BUT
BECAUSE MATHEMATICALLY WE FEEL
WE HAVE TO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S HOW ALL HISTORIC SEISMIC
CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED IN
AMERICA-- WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE.
SO HOW HAVE THEY MANAGED TO MAKE
THIS BILL BIPARTISAN?
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S A WIN-WIN--
GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE
THEY THINK IT WILL WIN THEM
HISPANIC VOTES AND GOOD FOR
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IT WILL
ACTUALLY WIN THEM HISPANIC VOTES
(LAUGHTER)
SOT WHAT IS IN THIS INCREDIBLE
PIECE OF LEGISLATION?
>> THE MEASURE CREATES A 13-YEAR
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, RAISES THE
CAP ON VISAS FOR HIGHLY SKILLED
WORKERS AND STRENGTHENS BORDER
SECURITY.
>> Jon: OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GREAT!
(LAUGHTER)
I'VE GOT TO SAY, AS AN IMMIGRANT
MYSELF, THIS IS ALSO VERY
EXCITING.
ALSO SLIGHTLY ANNOYING BECAUSE
IF THIS LAW HAD BEEN PASSED
YEARS AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO
SMUGGLE MYSELF INTO AMERICA
DRESSED AS AN ORDER OF FISH AND
CHIPS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THAT MADE FOR A PERILOUS
VINEGARY JOURNEY.
TO GET 60 VOTES YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED PRETTY DEEP SUPPORT.
JUST HOW MUCH DO DO THE
DEMOCRATS WANT THIS?
>> (SPEAKING SPANISH)
>> Jon: OOH, POR DIOS!
(LAUGHTER)
(IN SPANISH ACCENT)
YOU ARE TOO MUCHO.
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO WASH
DOWN YOUR LATINO PANDERING WITH
A MARGARITA.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT
POLITICAL POSITIONING, THIS IS
ABOUT ASPIRING TO OUR NATION'S
HIGHEST IDEALS, THE PRINCIPLES
THAT DREW OUR ANCESTORS ACROSS
THE SEAS.
>> IN MY CITY, MR. PRESIDENT,
THE CITY IN WHICH I WAS RAISED
AND IN WHICH I LIVE IS THAT
BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE HARBOR
WITH THAT BRIGHT TORCH.
>> Jon: WE CALL HERON DA THE
DOCK WHORE.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SHE GIVES $5 BLOW JOBS TO
LONGSHOREMEN WHILE HOLDING A
FLASHLIGHT.
A REAL NEW YORK INSTITUTION.
NOW, WHAT WERE YOU TALKING
