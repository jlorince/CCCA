>> Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE
FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS
WHOSE RECENT TRIAL ENDED IN A
HUNG JURY, EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE
COUNT THEY FOUND GUILTY.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM ROB BLAGOJEVICH.
>>THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO SAY CONGRATULATIONINGS.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO SAY
THANK YOU.
YOU WERE CONVICTED OF ONE COUNT.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
>> 23 DOWN, ONE TO GO.
THE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE.
THE ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENT WAS
ONE THAT THEY REACHED BACK FIVE
YEARS FROM FIVE YEARS AGO.
I AM APPEALING.
I WAS ARRESTED OF SELLING THE
SENATE SEAT FOR MONEY.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CORRUPTION
SCANDAL OF AMERICA.
THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT US
PUTTING ON A DEFENSE I DIDN'T
PROVE CORRUPTION.
>> Jon: YOU SAY "WE DIDN'T PUT
ON A DEFENSE."
YOU HAD BEEN GOING HERE, THERE,
EVERYWHERE, I CAN'T WAIT TO
TESTIFY, I'M SO EXCITED.
I'LL STAND IN LINE.
I WANT TO TELL MY STORY.
CHANCE TO TELL YOUR STORY, AND
YOU SAID, UH, NO, SILENCIO.
>> SI.
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT.
THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY BROUGHT
THESE CHARGES ALSO FALSELY SAID
THEIR CASE WAS GOING TO TAKE
FOUR MONTHS TO PUT ONFUL
EVERYTHING WAS PREDICATED ON THE
THINGS THEY SAID PUBLICLY.
WHEN THEY STARTED PUTTING ON
THEIR CASE, IN LESS THAN SIX
WEEKS THEY RESIDENTS.
MY LAWYER SAID, LIKE WE SAID,
THERE WAS NO CRIME, THEY DIDN'T
PROVE A CRIME.
SO THEREFORE YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT RESTING THECATION.
>> Jon: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
YOU AS A DICKENS CHARACTER.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU AS A
VICTIM, BUT YOU MAKE IT SO HARD.
[LAUGHTER]
TO TAKE YOUR SIDE COMPLETELY.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
>> Jon: BY NOT DOING THAT.
>> WELL, WE'LL HAVE CHANCE IN
THE NEXT TRIAL.
>> Jon: BUT...
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY.
>> Jon: YOU'RE SAYING, DON'T
WORRY, THEY'LL TRY ME AGAIN, AND
THIS TIME I'M REALLY GOING TO
GET UP THERE?
>> I WISH YOU'D PUT IT IN THIS
PERSPECTIVE, AS WELL.
THEY THREW EVERYTHING AT ME BUT
THE KITCHEN SINK.
THEY ACCUSED ME OF THE BIGGEST
CORRUPTION SCANDAL.
THEY TOLD ALL THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE THAT.
AND BEFORE I COULD CATCH MY
BREATH, EVERYBODY THOUGHT I WAS
A SCUMBAG AROUND THE WORLD.
RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT I WAS UP AGAINST.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHY.
YOU TELL ME YOU'RE ON THE SHOW
AND YOU WERE HERE LAST TIME.
YOU SAID... I SAID, THERE'S THAT
ONE QUOTE, VERY FAMOUS, I'VE GOT
THIS SENATE SEAT AND THIS THING
IS F-ING GOLDEN.
YOU SAID ON THE SHOW, SHOW 'EM
WHAT THEY SAID.
>> THIS IS F-ING GOLDEN.
WHAT COMES NEXT AND I CAN'T
QUOTED BECAUSE MY ACCUSER WON'T
LET ME.
>>
>> Jon: GENERALLY.
>> IT WAS ABOUT HELPING THE
STATE OF ILLINOIS, IT WAS ABOUT
POLITICS.
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
FINANCIAL GAIN OR SELLING THE
U.S. SENATE SEAT.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE TAPE YOU
SAID IF I COULD ONLY HAVE HEARD
THE NEXT LITTLE BIT.
>> WELL, THE NEXT WHOLE TAPE.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE NEXT LITTLE
BIT OF THAT TAPE.
>> I'VE GOT THIS THING, AND
BHEEP [BLEEPED] GOLDEN, AND I'M
JUST NOT GIVING IT UP FOR
NOTHING.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.
AND I CAN ALWAYS USE IT TO
PARACHUTE ME THERE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
GETTING YOURSELF.
APPOINTED.
>> AS THE GOVERNOR.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS.
THE GOVERNOR HAS THE POWER TO
MAKE HIMSELF A SENATOR IF HE
WANTS.
IF THIS WAS ABOUT A JOB FOR ME,
I COULD HAVE DONE IT THE MOMENT
OBAMA RESIGNS.
>> Jon: I DON'T QUESTION THAT.
WHAT I QUESTION IS YOU TOLD
ME...
>> LISTEN TO THE REST OF THE
TAPE.
IT TALKS ABOUT HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES.
YES, IT DOES.
JON NOT CLOSE TO IT.
YOU SAID THE NEXT FEW WORDS.
I'M GOING TO PARAPHRASE.
YOU END UP GOING OFF ON A RANT
OF HOW OBAMA'S A DEMAGOG.
>> DEMIGOD, LARGER THAN GOOD,
NOT TEMPERATURE MY GOOD.
>> Jon: YOU COULD HAVE TRIED
TO STOP HIM SPEAKING AT THE
CONVENTION AND NOW NO ONE CAN
STOP HIM.
>> WE HAD A POLITICAL
DISCUSSION.
>> Jon: DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY
POINT?
YOU SAID TO ME, IF YOU COULD
ONLY HEAR THE TAPE, THE NEXT
THING, YOU WOULD SEE, BUT
ORPHANS JUST NEED FOOD, AND THE
REALITY OF WHAT YOU SAID IS VERY
DIFFERENT.
>> NO, IT IS NOT.
ON THAT VERY TAPE, AND THEY
ACCUSED ME OF THIS.
JON YOU DON'T SAY LATER IN THE
TAPE, YOU SAY RIGHT AFTER THAT.
>> SHORTLY AFTER THE DISCUSSION.
HOLD ON A MINUTE!
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE TAPE.
I MENTION HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES.
>> Jon: IS THIS WHY YOU DIDN'T
TAKE THE STAND?
>> NO, JON.
THEY MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT
ACCUSING ME.
>> Jon: DO YOU PROMISE TO TAKE
THE STAND NEXT TIME YOU'RE
INDICTED?
DO YOU PROMISE TO DO THAT?
BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY...
ALL THIS OTHER STUFF, I'M
SERIOUS, YOU'RE A GUY THAT'S THE
MOST ADAMANT ABOUT HIS INNOCENCE
OF ANYONE I EVER MET, SO YOU'RE
EITHER, LIKE I SAY, YOU'RE
EITHER THE VICTIM OF A TERRIBLE
PERSECUTION OR YOU'RE A
SOCIOPATH.
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT A
SOCIOPATH, SO YOU HAVE TO COME
OUT AND NOT ON TALK SHOWS, IN A
COURT OF LAW, CLEAR YOUR NAME.
YOU HAVE TO.
>> WE HAVE A RIGHT AS A CITIZEN,
AS DO YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE IN
YOUR AUDIENCE.
UNTIL THEY MOVE YOU GUILTY...
>> NO ONE IS SUGGESTING YOU
DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT, AND BY
GOD YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
COME OUT AND GIVE THAT UP
PUBLICLY, STANDING IN FRONT OF A
CAMERA GOING, LET ME AT 'EM.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID YOU
WANTED TO DO IT, NOT ME.
I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEPED].
HONESTLY.
>> OKAY.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
>> Jon: HONESTLY, IF THIS IS
CORRUPTION AT THAT LEVEL, I HATE
TO SEE AN INNOCENT PERSON WITH
WHAT IS REALLY ONE OF THE NICEST
HEADS OF HAIR I THINK I'VE EVER
SEEN.
I HATE TO SEE A PERSON LIKE THAT
SUFFER THIS TYPE OF INDIGNITY.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BECAUSE I THINK IT'S
WRONG, BUT I ALSO DO NOT LIKE
SEEING SOMEONE STAND UP AND SAY,
I'VE BEEN WRONGED, LET ME HAVE
CHANCE TO CLEAR MY NAME, AND SAY
NOTHING.
>> I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT, AND
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH SOME ON
THE JURY WHO MAY HAVE FELT THAT
WAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
THIS IN THE BIG PICTURE AND WHAT
I WAS CONFRONTED WITH AND WHAT
WE STILL ARE CONFRONTED WITH.
THEY BROUGHT ALL THESE CHARGES.
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS
CONSEQUENCES ATTACHED TO THESE
CHARGES.
THEY ARE FALSE.
THEY BRING ALL THESE WITNESSES
IN.
NINE WITNESSES INVOLVED IN THE
CASE WHO HAVE ADMITTED TO
COMMITTING CRIMES OR HAVE BEEN
FOUND GUILTY.
THEY'RE HOLDING SENTENCES OVER
THEIR HEAD.
THEY WON'T SENTENCE THESE
PEOPLE.
IF YOU TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO
HEAR ABOUT HIM, WE'LL GIVE YOU
LESS TIME IN JAIL, BUT IF YOU
DON'T DO IT, WE'LL GIVE YOU MORE
TIME IN JAIL.
THEY CHARGED ME WITH POLITICAL
HORSE TRADING.
THEY OUGHT TO CHARGE THEMSELVES
WITH CRIMES AND THROW ANOTHER
COUNT OF HYPOCRISY IN THERE.
>>
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO DO THAT.
SO AGAIN, IF YOU GET OFF
SCOT-FREE, THERE'S A HUG FOR
YOU.
>> I'M D
