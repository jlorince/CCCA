IN A WORLD THAT'S DANGEROUS, YOUCAN NEVER COLLECT ENOUGH
INTELLIGENCE.

THE CLUE THAT STOPS THE NEXTTERROR ATTACH COULD BE IN A PILE
OF UNOPENED BANK STATEMENTSON YOUR KITCHEN TABLE OR A GIANT
BAG OF TAXI RECEIPTS YOU HAVEBEEN ACCUMULATING SINCE YOU
MOVED TO NEW YORK SIX YEARS AGO.
THE N.S.A. SHOULD REALLY JUSTTAKE IT ALL, MAYBE EVEN ORGANIZE
IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I'M NOT SURE THE N.S.A.IS INTERESTED IN THAT.
>> BUT, JON!
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NATIONALSECURITY!
WE CAN'T LET ANYTHING SLIPTHROUGH CRACKS!
THE N.S.A. SHOULD BE STORING ITALL FROM A COMPLETE SET OF
"FRASIER" DVDs YOU HAVEN'TWATCHED IN YEARS BUT CAN'T BEAR
TO PART WITH, OR A BOX OFCHERISHED TROPHIES AND
YEARBOOKS.
>> Jon: YOU JUST DOING SPRINGCLEANING, JORDAN?

NO THANK YOU!
YOU'RE TELLING ME THE N.S.A.DOESN'T HAVE A CLOSET WHERE
THEY CAN THROW ALL  MY (BLEEP)AND METICULOUSLY ANALYZE IT
