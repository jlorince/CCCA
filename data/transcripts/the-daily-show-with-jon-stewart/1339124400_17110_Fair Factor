>> Jon: FAIR GAME.
IT'S ABOUT FAIR GAME.
FAIR GAME IS A BIG ISSUE.
THAT THE MEDIA SEEMS TO BE TALKING ABOUT, ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S FAIR GAME FOR
OTHER PEOPLE TO BE TALKING ABOUT THESE BIG ISSUES.
>> NOW THIS BATTLE OVER BAIN,
WHAT IS FAIR GAME.
>> TAX ON MITT ROMNEY THE BUSINESSMAN AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS IN FACT FAIR GAME.
>> IS THAT FAIR GAME AND A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO USE ROMNEY'S
BUSINESS RECORD AGAINST HIM.
>> Jon: IS IT FAIR TO JUDGE JOB APPLICANT ITS ON PRIOR WORK EXPERIENCE?
(LAUGHTER) IT SAYS HERE, IT SAYS HERE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: LET ME SEE.
IT SAYS HERE YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND ARE YOU NOT EVEN
A DOCTOR BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS--  (LAUGHTER)
>> WELCOME ABOARD, NEW CHIEF OF SUJRY.
NOW GO SCRUP UP!
THEM HEART VALVES AIN'T GOING TO REPLACE THEMSELVES!
AND THE MEDIA IS NOT JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF THAT ISSUE.
IT'S EVERY ISSUE.
>> THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO LAUNCH THE RAID TO KILL OSAMA BIN LADEN.
>> WAS THAT FAIR GAME.
>> RELIGION AND THE RACE FOR 2012, WHAT'S FAIR, WHAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS?
>> ARE YOU FAIR GAME IF YOU COME OUT AND CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT?
>> IS IT FAIR GAME TO ATTACK HIM WITH THE MOST VITRIOLIC TYPE OF NAMES.
>> THE ISSUE OF MOTHERHOOD,
IS IT FAIR GAME.
>> Jon: SHOULD OUR FLAG HAVE 50 STARS WHEN SOME COUNTRY'S FLAGS ONLY HAVE TEN?
(LAUGHTER) BUT WHILE THE FAIRNESS OF A VARIETY OF POLITICAL TACTICS WOULD SEEM TO JUST ALMOST
PURELY IN THE REALM OF THE SUBJECTIVE, THERE ARE TIME WORN METHS THE NEWS MEDIA
HAS TO ADJUDICATE THESE MATTERS.
FOR INSTANCE IN YOUR ATTACK,
WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION.
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ATTACKING A ROM KNOW'S RECORD AS FAIR GAME
AND ATTACKING MITT ROMNEY'S RECORD IN TERMS OF POLITICAL GAIN.
>> THANK YOU.
YOU MAY ATTACK HIM, THAT'S FAIR GAMEMENT BUT NOT IF IT'S FOR POLITICAL GAIN.
YOU MAY ATTACK A POLITICIAN'S RECORD IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOURSELF
LOOK LIKE A BIG MAN AT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.
(LAUGHTER) FAIR GAME.
YOU CAN ATTACK A POLITICIAN'S RECORD BECAUSE YOU ARE UNSURE IF THAT
POLITICIAN-- TEAR DUCTS ARE CLOGGED AND YOU WANT TO SEE HIM WEEP, FAIR GAME.
BUT YOU MAY NOT ATTACK A POLITICIAN IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO JUST STOP HIM FROM BEATING YOU IN AN ELECTION.
(LAUGHTER) NOT FAIR GAME.
AND IF YOU ARE ATTACKING HIM AFTER GIVING HIM A HALF HOUR HEAD START IN A JUNGLE
COMPOUND, THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME OF ALL.
(LAUGHTER) I NEVER SHOULD HAVE READ HUNGER GAMES.
OF COURSE--  (APPLAUSE) MOTIVATION IS NOT THE ONLY PARAMETER FOR ATTACK.
POLITICAL FAIRNESS ALSO MANDATES THAT YOU CAN ONLY LOOK SO FAR BACK IN A CANDIDATE'S HISTORY.
>> WAS'S FAIR GAME.
HIGH SCHOOL HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS LINE, RIGHT, WHAT'S FAIR GAME HERE.
>> DO YOU THINK IT IS A QUESTION THAT IS WORTH ASKING?
IN OTHER WORDS, SHOW THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS.
>> SAYING THAT MITT ROMNEY'S FAMILY COMES FROM A POLYGAMIST COME MUNE IN
MEXICO S THAT FAIR GAME?
I MEAN IS THAT FAIR TO TALK ABOUT.
>> I MEAN, MITT ROMNEY'S GREAT, GREAT, GREAT-- I MEAN MANY GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE
EVICTED FROM THEIR HOME FOR NUDITY AND GRAND THEFT APPLE,
IS THAT FAIR GAME?
(LAUGHTER) THERE'S GOT TO BE A MORE ATTRACTIVE PICTURE OF THE TWO OF THEM.
IF ONLY THE NEWS NETWORKS HAD ACCESS TO EXPERTS WITH A SELFLESS INTEREST IF
DISCERNING THE FAIRNESS OF VARIOUS CAMPAIGN TACTICS.
>> IS IT FAIR GAME, I MEAN PUTTING-- PUTTING THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN IN A
POLITICAL AD AND TAKING THE ADDITIONAL STEP OF SUGGESTING MITT ROMNEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE KILL ORDER?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
>> THAT'S FAIR GAME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THIS WHOLE MEDIA IS IT FAIR CONVERSATION IS A TIME-KILLING CIRCLE JERK.
BUT THAT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO CIRCLE JERK,
BECAUSE EVEN CIRCLE JERK END WITH SOME KIND OF TANGIBLE CONCLUSION.
(LAUGHTER) OH, WHAT IF INSTEAD OF ASKING IF POLITICIANS ATTACKS ARE FAIR, MAYBE YOU
COULD FIND OUT IF THEY ARE TRUE OR ACCURATE OR RELEVANT,
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOME SORT OF SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICAL WAY OF CALCULATING THE FAIRNESS
OF SOMETHING THAT I AM UNAWARE OF.
>> TEXT YOUR ANSWER TO 36288 TYPE SR 1 FOR FAIR GAME, SR 2 FOR DIRTY POLITICS.
>> Jon: TEXTING!
NO BETTER WAY TO SOLVE POLITICS THAN WITH THE SAME METHOD WE USE TO DISTRIBUTE
PICTURES OF OUR GENITALS.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
