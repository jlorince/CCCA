( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
WE GOT IT GOING FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
I'M EXCITED.
TONIGHT'S PROGRAM, I GET TO
TALK ALMOST THE ENTIRE SHOW
ABOUT MY TWO FAVORITE
SYSTEMS.
POLITICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NEITHER OF WHICH I
UNDERSTAND IN ANY, SHAPE OR
FORM.
MY GUEST WILL BE CATHLEEN
KAVENY, A PROFESSOR OF LAW
AND THEOLOGY AT NOTRE DAME
UNIVERSITY AND WE'VE ASKED
HER TO COMPANY BY AND HELP
ME UNDERSTAND LAW AND
THEOLOGY.
APPARENTLY THAT SWEET SPOT
AT THE INTERSECTION OF LAW
STREET AND THEOLOGY AVENUE
HAS NO STOPLIGHT AND A FIRE
CAR PILEUP IS ON IT AND THE
WHOLE SOCIETY IS VERY UP SET
ON IT.
IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS
ISSUE OF A HEALTH INSURANCE
MANDATE THAT REQUIRES
EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE PLANS
THAT COVER CONTRACEPTION AS
PART OF WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE
HEALTH CARE.
SOME RELIGIOUS GROUPS THAT
ALSO HIRE THE UNFORTUNATELY
NAMED LADY, HAVE SAID THAT
THIS VIOLATES THEIR
PRINCIPLESES.
THUS, YESTERDAY, AND TODAY
THE UNITED STATES SENATE
DEBATED A MEASURE THAT WOULD
ONLY REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO
PROVIDE HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE,
QUOTE, CONSISTENT WITH THEIR
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MORAL
CONVICTIONS.
IT'S CALLED THE BLUNT
AMENDMENT, AFTER HOW HIGH
YOU HAVE TO BE TO THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO PASS IT
[BLEEP] WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ALSO THE SPONSOR OF
THE BILL IS MISSOURI
REPUBLICAN ROY BLUNT.
SO THAT ALSO MAY HAVE
BEEN-- THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED
ALSO A ROLE IN THE NAME.
HOW SERIOUS IS THIS ISSUE
RIGHT NOW?
DAMN THING'S A WEEK OLD AND
MITT ROMNEY IS ALREADY TAKE
TWO POSITIONS ON IT
(LAUGHTER)
AND HE TOOK THE TWO
POSITIONS WITHIN THREE AND A
HALF HOURS OF EACH OTHER.
>> -- BEING DEBATED I
BELIEVE LATER THIS WE CAN,
THAT DEALS WITH BANNING, OR
ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO BAN
PROVIDING FEMALE
CONTRACEPTION.
>> YOU HAVE TAKEN A
POSITION.
>> I'M NOT FOR THE BILL.
CONDITION TRACEPTION IS
WORKING JUST FINE.
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.
>> OF COURSE I SUPPORT THE
BLUNT AMENDMENT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT SOME STATE LAW THAT
PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM
GETTING CONTRACEPTION.
SO I TALKED ABOUT
CONTRACEPTIVES BEFORE.
SO I REALLY MISUNDERSTOOD
THE QUESTION.
>> Jon: THAT IS-- I
GOT-- DOW-- OXFORD ENGLISH
DICTIONARY, I SUBMIT TO YOU,
A NEW MEASURE OF TIME, THE
ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
JSES IT'S DEFINED AS THE
THREE AND A HALF HOUR WINDOW
IN WHICH A GROWN MAN RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT CAN CHANGE HIS
DEEPLY HELD CONVICTION TO
ITS OPPOSITE.
(LAUGHTER)
LET ME USE IT IN A SENTENCE
FOR YOU.
OH MY GOD WE'VE BEEN IN THIS
[BLEEP] FOR TWO AND A HALF
ROMNEYS NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
I NEED TO PEE.
NO, I DON'T.
BUT IT'S NO WONDER A ROM NAE
WAS CONFUSED.
THE INTERVIEWER ASKED ROMNEY
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL, AND AS
THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR'S
DEBATING THE AMENDMENT
YESTERDAY MADE CLEAR, THE
BLUNT AMENDMENT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH BIRTH CONTROL.
>> MANY HAVE TRIED TO
CHARACTERIZE THIS AMENDMENT
AS DENYING WOMEN ACCESS TO
CONTRACEPTION.
THAT'S A RED HERRING.
>> THE WORD CONTRACEPTION IS
NOT IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S
NOT ABOUT A SPECIFIC
PROCEDURE.
>> IT THEY WANT TO SOMEHOW
SHROUD THIS, AND VEIL IT AS
A WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUE.
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT
CONTRACEPTIVES.
>> Jon: IT IS ABOUT THE
WHORES WHO USE CONTRACEPTIVES.
THE AND DANCING.
IT'S ABOUT DANCING.
IT ALWAYS BEGINS WITH THE
DANCING.
AND THE FACE PAINT.
AND CULOTTES, OH, GARMENT OF
TEMPTATION, YOU ARE THE
DEVIL'S PANTALONES.
FUNNY, YOU WANT TO PRESENT
SOME EVIDENCE THAT ISN'T
ABOUT CONTRACEPTION?
>> WELL, I WENT ON THE
INTERNET AND I WAS ASKED
UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO PUT
INTO THE RECORD AN OPEN
LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT THAT
IS BEING SIGNED BY WOMEN ALL
OVER THIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: OPEN LETTER FROM THE
INTERNET.
IF OPEN LETTERS FROM THE
INTERNETWORKED HALF OUR
AUDIENCE WOULD BE UNDERNEATH
A REDWOOD SMOKING-- WEED
WITH MUMIO RIGHT NOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DID I SAY HALF, I MEANT 98%.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BY ENTERING THIS
LETTER INTO THE RECORD, THAT
SENATOR AVOIDS HAVING TO
ACTUALLY READ THAT LETTER
OUTLOUD.
WHICH MEANS YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE TO GO TO THE
CONGRESSIONAL LETTER TO FIND
OUT THAT THIS, NOT ABOUT
CONTRACEPTION LETTER STATES,
QUOTE, GOVERNMENT
CONTRACEPTIVE PROGRAMS
INEVITABLY CHANGE THE SEX,
DATING AND MARRIAGE MARKETS
IN WAYS THAT LEAD TO MORE
EMPTY SEX.
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY
MEANT THAT IN A NEGATIVE
WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WE HAVE HEARD IT'S NOT
REALLY ABOUT CONTRACEPTION,
IT'S REALLY ABOUT LIBERTY
AND IF IT'S ABOUT LIBERTY
THERE IS ONLY ONE GROUP THAT
HASN'T WEIGHED IN.
GENTLEMEN, TO THE FOUNDING
FATHERS MOBILE.
>> WE SHOULD NOT LET A
GOVERNMENT INTERFERE IN
THESE BASIC RIGHTS OF
CONSCIENCE, A TERM OF THOMAS
JEFFERSON WHEN HE WROTE THE
NEW LONDON METHODIST IN
1809.
>> Jon: SO ON THE BLUNT
AMENDMENT FOUNDING FATHER
THOMAS
