IT'S THE SUBJECT OFTONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014.
COME ON REPUBLICANS, JUST GOAHEAD AND TAKE OVER ALREADY!
RECENT POLLS INDICATE A BADNIGHT AHEAD FOR THE
DEMOCRATS.
WELL, NOT BAD.

FALLS AND WASHES AWAY ALL THATTHEY'VE EVER WORKED FOR?
OH, BUT APPARENTLY IT'S THEIROWN DAMN FAULT.
>> WHY WOULD ANYONE VOTE FORA  DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATE.
THE ANSWER HE IS EMOTION.
>> THEY CAN'T ARGUE ON THEECONOMY.
THEY CAN'T ARGUE ON FOREIGNPOLICY.
THEY CAN'T ARGUE ON THECOMPETENCE OF GOVERNMENT.
THEY CAN'T ARGUE REALLY ONANYTHING.
>> IT'S REALLY TRUE.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RATIONALARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW
BEST TO GOVERN, YOU HAVE TOTURN TO THE REPUBLICANS.
OUR NATION'S TRUE STATESMEN!
(LAUGHTER)THE REPUBLICANS CLOSING
ARGUMENTS CAN BE FOUND INTHIS QUITE COGENT
ILLUMINATING COMPENDIUM OFTHEIR MORE ELOQUENT AND
UNEMOTIONAL REPOSTS.

A POWERFUL AND COGENTESSAYISTIC ARGUMENT.
MOVE OVER HOPE AND CHANGEAND WELCOME VOTE FOR US
OR GET BEHEADED WHILE POOPINGBLOOD!
(LAUGHTER)DOES THAT HAPPEN?
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SOME MIGHT SAY-- SOME MIGHT
SAY IT TAKES A LOT OF BALLSTO SAY YOUR OPPONENT HAS NO
GOOD RATIONAL ARGUMENTS WHENYOUR BEST ARGUMENT APPEARS
TO BE REACHING INTO OLDERVOTERS HEADS AND POKING
THEIR AMYGDALAS.
THE AMYGDALAS, IT'S THE FEARCENTER.
(LAUGHTER)I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE JUST
SAID FEAR CENTER.
(LAUGHTER)THEN YOU WOULD PROBABLY
THINK TO YOURSELF AMYGDALA,BUT THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THE THALAMUS'SROLE.
THE POINT IS COME ON,REPUBLICANS, YOU GOT
SOMETHING BALSIER?
>> WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BRINGTHE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE
GRIDLOCK TO A MERCIFUL END.
>> YOU WANT TWO YEARS LIKETHE LAST FOUR YEARS WHERE WE
JUST BUTT HEADS AND BUTTHEADS AND BUTT HEADS?

WE'RE GOING TO GET BUTTHEADS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT MITCH McCONNELL, SENATOR
MITCH McCONNELL, COME ON,WHO BETTER TO BRING THE
GRIDLOCK TO A MERCIFUL ENDTHAN THE GUY WHO HAS BEEN
BLOCKING THE BOX FOR SIXYEARS.
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO GET BY?(LAUGHTER)
SO LET'S JUST SAY THE GOP'SMESSAGE OF CIVIC OPTIMISM
DOESN'T RESONATE.
LET'S SAY THE VOTERS DON'TTAKE TO IT.
WHAT'S THE BACKUP PLAN.
TO GET THE REPUBLICANS THE POWERTHEY SO DESPERATELY WILL ONLY
GOVERN WHEN THEY HAVE.
>> TEXAS'S TOUGH VOTER I.D. LAWWILL BE IN FULL FORCE FOR
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
>> THE LAW COULD PREVENTMORE THAN 600,000 REGISTERED
VOTERS IN TEXAS FROM VOTINGIN PERSON.
>> MORE THAN 400,000ELIGIBLE VOTERS WOULD HAVE
TO TRAVEL THREE HOURS ORMORE TO THE NEAREST
GOVERNMENT OFFICE ISSUINGI.D.s.
>> AH YES, THE PARTY THAT NEVERMET A GUN PURCHASE
RESTRICTION THEY THOUGHT WASNOT ONEROUS WANTS TO MAKE
SURE NO ONE EVER WALKS INTO ASCHOOL AND UNLAERBS A WANTON
SPRAY OF BALLOTS.
NOW BEAR IN MIND-- (LAUGHTER)
I GOT -- I GOT MY PEN BACK.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BEAR IN MIND WE'RE TALKINGABOUT TEXAS.
THE DEREGULATION CAPITOLOF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
THE STATE WHOSE OFFICIAL STATESYMBOL IS THE
UNINSPECTED EXPLODINGCHEMICAL PLANT.
I IMAGINE TO GET TEXAS ON THEVOTER REGULATION TRAIN, WELL
THEY HAVE GOT TO HAVE A PRETTYSERIOUS PROBLEM DOWN THERE.
>> THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN TWOPROVEN CASES OF VOTER FRAUD
IN THE PAST DECADE IN TEXAS.
>> SINCE 2002, OF THEMILLIONS OF VOTES CAST IN
TEXAS DURING THAT PERIOD,-- .
>> Jon: ACTUALLY 20 MILLIONVOTES, I WAS JUST CALCULATING
IT. 20 MILLION VOTES WERE CASTAND TWO OF THEM WERE PROVEN
FRAUDULENT, SO THAT'S .1PARTS PER MILLION.
OR LESS THAN HOW MUCHCOCKROACH WE ALLOW IN OUR
YOGURT. AND -- NO THAT --
(APPLAUSE)THAT HAPPENS TO BE
COCKROACH AND HONEY YOGURT.
TEXAS IS JUST ONE OFSEVERAL REPUBLICAN LED STATES
THAT SET STRONGER VOTERRESTRICTION AFTER THE SUPREME
COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTSACT.
MUST HAVE BEEN A COINCIDENCE.LIKE NORTH CAROLINA.
WHICH IS RISKING ITS REPUTATIONAS THE LESS [BLEEP] CAROLINA.
>> THE NEW VOTER LAWINCLUDES A PHOTO I.D.
REQUIREMENT.
A BAN ON SAME-DAYREGISTRATION.
NO OUT OF PRECINCT VOTING,AND A REDUCTION IN THE
NUMBER OF EARLY VOTING DAYS.
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKSTHERE'S BEEN A FLURRY OF
COURT APPEALS AND DECISIONSWHICH FIRST UPHELD THEN
REVERSED, THEN UPHELD AGAINTHE NEW REQUIREMENTS.
>> THANKS FOR THAT REPORT,KELLY.
OH, YES, THEY UPHELD, THEYUNHELD NORTH CAROLINA'S
FAMOUSLY INDECISIVE COURTS, WEFIND THE DEFENDENT GUILTY,
NOT GUILTY, OH [BLEEP] IT, KILLHIM.
(APPLAUSE)LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS, FAR BE
IT FROM ME TO QUESTION ANYONE'SMOTIVES.
BUT COME ON A LOT OF THESELAWS SMELL PRETTY VOTER
SUPPRESSION-Y.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEKINDS OF I.D. THAT CAN BE
USED IN TEXAS, YOU CAN USEYOUR GUN REGISTRATION BUT
YOU CANNOT USE YOUR COLLEGEVOTER I.D..
>> Jon: THAT ONE IS PRETTY EASYTO EXPLAIN. WITHOUT A GUN
REGISTRATION, HOW ARE YOUSUPPOSED TO OPPERATE A TEXAS
VOTING BOOTH? YEAH -- THAT'S UH-- YOU'VE GOT TO --
>> THE GOVERNMENTACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE,
NONPARTISAN RESEARCH, FOUNDTHAT A STUDY OF VOTER I.D.
LAWS THAT IT ACTUALLYLOWERED THE TURNOUT IN
TENNESSEE AND KANSAS TWOSTATES STUDIED AMONG MINORITY
VOTERS AND YOUNGER VOTERS.
>> Jon: THE YOUNG AND THEBROWN.
IF ONLY THEY COULD FIND AWAY TO GET WOMEN ON THERE
THEY WOULD NULLIFY THEDEMOCRATS TRIPLE CROWN.
>> WOMEN CHANGE THEIR NAMESMORE OFTEN THAN MEN WHEN
THEY MARRY OR DIVORCE MAKINGIT MORE OF A CHALLENGE TO
CARRY I.D. OR PROOF OFCITIZENSHIP IN THEIR CURRENT
LEGAL NAME.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.
ONEROUS LAWS TO PREVENTNONEXISTENT FRAUD THAT
HAPPENS TO TILT THE ELECTIONS INFAVOR OF THE RATIONAL ARGUMENT
FOR GOVERNANCE REPUBLICANS NEVERACTUALLY MADE ALL PRESENTED
WITH THE HIGHEST OF IDEALS.
>> ONE PERSON GETS ONE VOTE,NOT TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR
FIVE.
>> IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURETHAT WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE
THAT ARE ABUSING THE SACREDRIGHT OF VOTING.
>> I DON'T WANT DEAD PEOPLEVOTING IN THE STATE OF SOUTH
