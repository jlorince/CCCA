EVERYBODY'S GOT EVERYTHING.
I MEAN, YOU REALLY GOT HIT WITHTHE WHAMMIES OF WHAMMIES.
A BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS WASTHE FIRST WHAMMIE, YES?
>> IN 2007, YES.
AND, I COMPLETED TREATMENT IN2008.
BUT THE REASON I SAIDEVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING.
AND IT'S TRUE.
YEAH, I GOT SLAPPED UPSIDE THEHEAD AND EVERYTHING.
BUT THE POINT MY MOM SAID, ITDOESN'T MATTER.
EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING.
AND MY SOMETHING IS NO MOREIMPORTANT OR GREATER THAN ANY
OTHER CHALLENGE THAT SOMEONEELSE WAS FACING. BUT, THERE WAS
A POINT, I WILL AGREE, WHERE IWAS LOOKING UP TO THE HEAVENS
AND SAYING, IF YOU WANT TOSPREAD IT AROUND A LITTLE
BIT MORE, THAT WOULD BE FINEWITH ME.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THAT IS,IT'S, YOU KNOW, PARENTS CAN
DELIVER THIS KIND OF SAGEADVICE AND THEY CAN DO IT IN A
BIT OF A VACUUM. BUT, I THINKTHEY NEVER KNOW IF THEIR KIDS,
YOU SEEMED TO HAVE ABSORBED YOURPARENTS' LESSONS OF IT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUBUT THE WAY YOU DEAL WITH IT
IN A WAY THAT MUST MAKE THEMINCREDIBLY PROUD.
>> WELL, BECAUSE MY PARENTS --MY DAD GREW UP IN JERSEY.
AND UH, YES.
>> Jon: I'M FAMILIAR.
>> AS A SMALL CHILD HE HAD THENERVE TO CUT OFF A BROOM STICK
HANDLE AND GO DOWN THEBASEMENT AND DREAM OF
FLYING AND BECAME A TUSKEEGEEAIRMAN.
MY MOTHER WAS THE FIRST IN HERFAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND
WAS ON THE STATE BOARDOF EDUCATION.
SO, I COME FROM GOOD STOCK, ANDI KIND OF LISTENED TO THEM.
NOT ALL THE TIME, I'LL ADMIT, ASA CHILD NOT SO MUCH, BUT
I'M GRATEFUL THAT SOME OF THELIFE LESSONS STAYED WITH ME.
EVERY MORNING WHEN I ENTER THESTUDIO FOR "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA" I BLOW A KISS TO BOTHOF THEM UP THERE AND SAY GOOD
MORNING TO THEM BEFORE I SAY"GOOD MORNING AMERICA".
>> Jon: AND THEN WHEN YOU AREDONE WITH THAT DO YOU DOWN TO
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.
I KNOW HE IS ONLY --[LAUGHTER]
HE'S LIKE -- HE'S -->> I WAS WAITING FOR THAT.
IT TOOK YOU A LITTLE LONGER THANI THOUGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THAT'S A TERRIBLE
THING. HE'S ACTUALLY A GOODFRIEND.
I HAVE TO GET HIM.
LET ME GIVE HIM A CALL.
[LAUGHTER]HE AND I ARE THE SAME SIZE, BY
THE WAY.
>> THE FIRST CHRISTMAS GIFT HEGAVE ME SIX INCH HEELS.
THAT'S THE KIND OF GOOD SPORTTHAT HE IS.
>> Jon: THAT'S VERY NICE. DURINGTHAT TIME, WERE YOU
THINKING TO YOURSELF, MAN, ICAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK UP AT
3:00 A.M. AND GET TO WORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> NOT SO MUCH.
IT WAS NICE TO HAVE THAT SIXMONTH BREAK.
BUT THE POINT OF IT IS WHEN YOUARE GOING THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE
THAT, ESPECIALLY, AND I WAS OFFTHE AIR FOR SIX MONTHS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE NOT SITTING INTHAT CHAIR FOR SIX MONTHS?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YES.

>> Jon: I'M STANDING ON A COOLMOUNTAIN AND A BREEZE WAS GOING
THROUGH MY HAIR.

NORMAL FOR ME IS GETTING UP AT3:45 AND GETTING IN THE STUDIO
AND DOING WHAT I DO.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
DID YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU LOSTYOURSELF?
>> OH -->> Jon: OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONAL YOUSORT OF BECAME OUTSIDE OF
YOURSELF OR SOMETHING ELSE?
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMESBECAUSE DURING THE -- YOU
KNOW, BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTWHAT THEY DO IS THEY COMPLETELY
TAKE AWAY YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEMBECAUSE IT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL
AND IT'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
THEY HAVE TO WIPE IT OUT.
I WAS SO THANKFUL THAT MY SISTERWAS A PERFECT MATCH.
SO THEY INSERTED HER STEMCELLS. AND IT'S LIKE A REBIRTH.
SO I REALLY FELT LIKE I WASCOMING BACK TO LIFE, AND THERE
WERE TIMES THAT I WAS JUSTOUTSIDE OF MYSELF. I WAS TOLD
THERE WAS ONE POINT I WAS IN THEHOSPITAL AND HALLUCINATING.
I NURSE CAME IN AND SHE SAID IWAS INTERVIEWING WALTER CRONKITE
AT THE FOOT OF MY BED.
TRUE STORY.
[LAUGHTER]YES, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I WAS
OUTSIDE OF MY BODY FOR A WHILE.
