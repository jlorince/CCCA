JORDAN.
>> LAST WEEK IN THE U.K., THECONSERVATIVE PARTY HAD A HUGE
VICTORY.
I ASSUME BY USING THE SAME WEDGEISSUES AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE
CANDIDATES USE SO EXCERPTLY.

WE HAVE IT, AND NO ONE, IT'S ALLFINE.
>> SO  WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU GUYSTALK ABOUT?
>> WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. WETALK ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE
DEFICIT -- >> BORING.
MAYBE POLITICAL CONSULTANT STEVEMORGAN CAN TELL US WHY THEY'RE
IGNORING THESE KEY ISSUES.
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE WOULD ARGUEWE DEAL WITH THE
REAL ISSUES HERE AND THOSE ARENOT THOSE.
>> IS THERE ANY PARTY OUTTHERE THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE
FUN, WILD CARD STUFF,LIKE CLIMATE DENIERS OR
ANTI-IMMIGRATION OR BIG FEARSAND STUFF LIKE THAT?
>> WELL, WE'VEGOT ANTI-IMMIGRATION FROM THE
UKIP PARTY.>> UKIP? WHAT IS THAT?
>> THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY.
AND THEY'RE A VERY DANGEROUSPARTY BECAUSE
THEY'RE XENOPHOBIC.
THEY APPEAL TO THE WORSTELEMENTS OF BRITISH SOCIETY.
>> OKAY, THAT'S A PARTY IUNDERSTAND.
THAT SOUND LIKE GOOD OLDAMERICAN CAMPAIGNING.
BUT WAS UCIP CANDIDATE KIM ROSEABLE TO WALK THE FINE LINE
BETWEEN EXPLOITING PEOPLE'SFEARS AND BALD-FACED HATRED?
>> YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT RACIST.
WE WANT TO STOP THE MASSMIGRATION OF PEOPLE COMING INTO
THIS COUNTRY.
THEY'RE COMING OVER IN VASTNUMBERS AND NOW YOU'VE GOT
COMMUNITIES TAKING UP PARTS OFTHE TOWN WHICH ARE ALL FULL OF
LIKE POLISH PEOPLE.
>> SEE, HE'S NOT RACIST.
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE POLISHPEOPLE.
>> I'M NOT A RACIST. WHAT I'MTRYING TO PROVE IS AN ACTUAL
FACT, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'TABOUT RACE.
THIS IS ABOUT SPACE.
ALL WE WANT IS OUR COUNTRY BACK.
>> IF YOU'RE NOT REPEATEDLYDEFENDING THE FACT THATYOU'RE BEING
CALLED A RACIST OVERAND OVER AGAIN,
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

ABOUT HIS POLICIES.
>> I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR A HITLERCOMMENT.
SO I QUOTED FROM THE BOOK OF"MEIN KAMPF."
>> THE NAZI REFERENCE, GOODIDEA.
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T USUALLYACTUALLY QUOTE HILTLER.
SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS READY FORAMERICAN-STYLE POLITICS.
HE JUST NEEDED A COUPLE OFPOINTERS FROM A PRO.
>> THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY OUR POLICEFORCE.
THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY OURARMY.
>> GIVE HER THE WORST-CASESCENARIO.

INTO PIECES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING INTHIS COUNTRY.
>> BOOM! WALK AWAY. JUST, GOOD,GOOD.
>> ULTIMATELY, KIM ROSE ENDED UPWITH A WHOPPING 13% OF THE VOTE,
WHICH SEEMS LIKE WAY MORE THANHE DESERVED.
AND ACTUALLY, IN THE TIME ISPENT HERE IN BRITAIN, APART
FROM THEIR TERRIBLE VERSION OFBASEBALL, I WAS IMPRESSED WITH
THEIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM.
GUYS LIKE THIS ARE MAGINALIZED.
THEY SPEND LITTLE ON THEELECTIONS.
THEY HAD JUST SIX WEEKS TOCAMPAIGN, AND THEIR NEWS MEDIA
PROVIDES REASONABLY SOBERANALYSIS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> BUT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHINGTHAT WAS BOTHERING ME.
WHAT WAS IT.
>> ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THEIRAQ WAR?
>> THE IRAQ WAR?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GUYS WERE INVOLVED IN THAT,TOO.
>> YEAH, WE WERE THERE.
>> YOU GUYS HAVE MADE SOMEFUCKING BONEHEAD MOVES.
>> YEAH.
>> ALL RIGHT, LIKE US, THEYFOUGHT AN UNNECESSARY WAR.
THEIR GOVERNMENT APPROVALRATINGS ARE DISMAL.
AND BRITISH LEADERS EVENPROMISED PUNISHING AUSTERITY
MEASURES. SO APPARENTLY, NOMATTER YOUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM,
YOUR GOVERNMENT WILL FINDA WAY TO FUCK IT ALL UP.
OR COURSE, IF YOU'RE BRITISHTHERE IS A CULTURAL
ADVANTAGE THAT CANNOT BE DENIED.
>> HEY, AND JORDAN WE ALSO USETHE WORD CUNT.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM HERE, SOCHEERS!
HERE'S TO THE POLITICS.
>> WE DO.
>> HEY CUNT!
>> CUNT.
>> GOOD DAY, CUNT.
