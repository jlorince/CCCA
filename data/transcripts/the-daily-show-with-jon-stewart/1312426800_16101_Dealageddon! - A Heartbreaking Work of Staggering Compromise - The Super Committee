POLISH MY CUP OF SLOT MACHINE
TOKENS.
STILL, AFTER ALL THE SHOUTING
WAS DONE, THE IMPORTANT THING IS
WE GOT A DEAL.
THE COUNTRY HAS FINALLY GOT ITS
SPENDLING AND DEBT UNDER
CONTROL.
>> THIS IS HOW MUCH OUR DEBT WAS
GOING TO RISE BEFORE THE
COMPROMISE DEAL, NEARLY $29
TRILLION IN TEN YEARS.
THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS AFTERWARDS.
THE BLACK SHOWS HOW MUCH OF THE
OVERSPENDING WILL BE CUT, DOWN
TO $26 TRILLION.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
[BOOING]
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE
[BLEEPED] THING WAS ABOUT?
THIS WHOLE BROUHAHA ACCORDING TO
DIANE SAWYER'S PARALLELOGRAM OF
DISAPPOINTMENT MANAGED TO REMOVE
ONE CHOCOLATE SHAVING FROM OUR
DAIRY QUEEN GUT-BUSTER SUNDAE OF
DEBT.
>> THEY'RE CALLING IT THE SUPER
COMMITTEE.
>> IT HAS SUPERPOWERS.
>> A DOZEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
>> EVENLY DIVIDE BETWEEN
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
>> CHARGED WITH FINDING $1.5
TRILLION IN DEFICIT SAVINGS.
>> A SUPER COMMITTEE.
>> A SUPER CONGRESS WITH SUPER
POWERS.
>> THE SUPER COMMITTEE DEALS
WITH EVERYTHING.
>> Jon: OUR PRAYERS ARE
ANSWERRERED.
AMERICA'S OWN LEGION OF DOOFS,
BUT WHICH OF OUR LEADERS HAS
POWERS FAR ABOVE THOSE OF MORTAL
LEGISLATORS.
IT MIGHT INCLUDE HARRY REID, AKA
THE SENATOR DRONE.
HE'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THINGS
FOR A LONG TIME.
SENATOR JON KYL, THE TRICKLER.
HIS GOLDEN STREAM OF PROTECTION
SHIELDS THE RICH.
I'M SORRY, THE JOB CREATORS.
OH, LOOK, IT'S PROFESSOR KVETCH,
DROWNING OUT OPPONENTS WITH HIS
SUPERSONIC WHINE.
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK
WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE...
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, OR OLD
MAN MAN.
BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE EVEN
OLDER MAN, OLD MAN MAN ALWAYS
GETS HIS WAY AND ANY BALLS THAT
HAPPEN THE LAND IN HIS YARD.
TOGETHER WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE,
THEY ARE THE SUPER COMMITTEE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT CAN EVEN THE SUPER COMMITTEE
SAVE CONGRESS AT THIS POINT FROM
CONGRESS'S ARCHENEMY, THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE?
>> NEW POLL NUMBERS JUST OUT,
LOOKS LIKE THE COUNTRY FEELS
LIKE WASHINGTON HAS ACTED LIKE A
BUNCH OF SPOILED CHILDREN.
>> 17% BELIEVE THAT ELECTED
OFFICIALS ACTED LIKE RESPONSIBLE
ADULTS.
77% SAY ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO
DEALT WITH THE DEBT CEILING
CRISIS HAVE ACTED LIKE SPOILED
CHILDREN.
>> THE POLLSTERS TELL US
AMERICANS ARE USING WORDS LIKE
"RIDICULOUS," DISGUSTING,
STUPID, CHILDISH, DISAPPOINTING
AND A JOKE TO DESCRIBE THEIR
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES.
>> Jon: OTHERS MERELY BELCHED
OR FARTED INTO THE PHONE.
