>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
THE BIG QUESTION, THE BIGQUESTION FOR THE IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL IS WHETHEROPPONENTS CAN REACH OF VETO-
PROOF TWO-THIRDS OF CONGRESSTO BLOCK THIS DEAL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING TONEED THE SUPPORT OF POWERFUL
DEMOCRATS, LIKE SENATOR CHARLESSCHUMER.
>> THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM NEWYORK FROOM BROOKYLEN, THE KEY
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT PRESIDENTOBAMA'S IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WILL
GET DERAILED BY CONGRESS.
WE ARE SITTING DOWN FORBREAKFAST THIS MORNING WITH
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER.

A GREAT IDEA.

HIS IDEAS ABOUT IRAN WILLSTILL BE-- NO!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
YOU BROUGHT IN OLD NEW YORKJEWISH MAN TO A DINER!
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THISMEANS.
YOU WILL NEVER END UPTALKING ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL,
WILL YOU JUST END UP TALKINGABOUT THE [BLEEP] DINER.
>> HOW THEY HAVE SO MANYDISHES AND THEY'RE ALL FRESH
AND GOOD.
MANY OF THE GREEK DINEESCHES HAVE LITTLE COOKIES
AT THE END THAT THEY SERVEYOU.
YOU CAN TELL THE QUALITY OFTHAT.
USUALLY A GREEK FAMILY,FATHER, HUSBAND, WIFE.
EACH DINER HAS ITS OWNSPECIALTIES BUT THERE ARE
CERTAIN THINGS A GOODHAMBURGER AND FRENCH FRIES A
GOOD DINER HAS TO HAVE.
THE MENU HAS TO BE SEVEN-- SEVENOR EIGHT PAGES, THEY HAVE TO
HAVE EVERYTHING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IF THE DINER'S MENUCAN'T BE USED AS A MURDER
WEAPON, IT'S NOT A REAL DINER.
ANYWAY, ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL.
>> HERE IS ANOTHER LITTLETRICK.
I DILUTE MY ORANGE JUICE.
YOU DRINK THIS GLASS OFORANGE, IT'S 200 CALORIES AND
IT'S ACIDIC.
DO THIS PUT 9/10 WATER, ONETENT WATER, AFTER A WEEK OR
TWO IT TASTES THE SAME ANDONE TENTH THE CALORIES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ALSO SOMETHING ELSE ILEARNED, YOU ORDER A NICE BIG
MEAL, AND JUST RUB IT ON YOURGUMS WITHOUT SWALLOWING, THE
NUTRIENTS ARE ABSORBED UNDER THELIP.
OR BETTER YET, ORDER A SLICEOF CARROT CAKE, YOU GET IT
TO GO.
AND THEN THROW IT IN THEHUDSON RIVER.
IT COSTS $4, BUT IT'S ZEROCALORIES.
CAN WE GET TO THE IRAN DEAL?
>> I LOVE GRITS, I LOVEANYTHING WITH CORN.
I LIKED GRITS WHEN I FIRSTTASTED THEM.
I SAID I WONDER WHY I LIKETHEM, THAT WAS IN WASHINGTON,
WHICH WAS EVEN THEN IN 81RYIN MORE SOUTHERN CITY THAN
IT IS NOW.
WHY DO I LIKE THEM, IT'SCORN.
SENATOR, SAVE IT FOR THEMEMOIR, WHICH BRINGS US US
TO CHAPTER 37, MY GRITSAWAKENING.
LOOK, ALTHOUGH AS IT TURNSOUT, THAT CONTAINS A BIZARRE
TWIST.
>> GUESS WHAT I HAVE ON MYGRITS, WHICH THE SOUTHERNERS
WOULD TURN THEIR NOSE UP TO, THEY HAVE BUTTER OR SOMETHING--
SWEET 'N LOW.
A BROOKLYN PRODUCT, 1200 JOBS INBROOKLYN ARE SWEET 'N LOW JOBS,
DIRECT AND INDIRECT SO I EAT ALOT OF THIS STUFF.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT'S [BLEEP] WEIRD,THAT'S WEIRD -- IS THAT LIKE A
CONSTITUENT SERVICE?
I'M FROM BROOKLYN, SO I HAVE TOUSE AS MUCH SWEET 'N LOW.
DURING THE WINTER I DON'TSALT MY DRIVEWAY, A SWEET 'N
LOW MY DRIVIEWAY.
EVERY YEAR FOR HANUKKAH WEHIDE THE SWEET 'N LOW.
HOW DO I TAKE MY COFFEE, YOUGUESSED IT BLACK -- FOLLOWED
BY THREE MUGS OF SWEET 'NLOW.
ENOUGH TALKING ABOUT FOOD INTHE DINER.
CAN WE GET TO THE HISTORICNUCLEAR DEAL?
>> LET'S START WITH THIS.
