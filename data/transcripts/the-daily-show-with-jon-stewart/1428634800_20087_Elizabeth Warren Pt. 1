(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
♪♪>> THANK YOU!
>> Jon: SENATOR !
>> THANK YOU! THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: "A FIGHTING CHANCE" --
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT IS YOU!
>> IT IS!
ALL THE WAY.
>> Jon: VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I HAVE BEEN READING -- I READSOMETIMES, THE WHAT DO THEY
CALLED IT THERE, BLOGS.
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WING NOW OFTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
THERE IS A WARREN WING,APPARENTLY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THE WINGIS, COULD BE JUST A COUPLE OF
ROOMS, BUT I THINK IT MAY BEGROWING.
DO YOU FEEL THAT SENSE?
>> YOU KNOW, I DO FEEL THATSENSE.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND IT'S NOT MY WING, IT'SOUR WING.
IT'S THE IDEA IS -->> Jon: IT'S A WARREN WING.
DON'T FIGHT THE ALLITERATION, ITWORKS.
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO IT, THISQUESTION HAS BEEN ON MY MIND FOR
A WHILE.
THE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON,ARE THEY CYNICALLY MANIPULATING
OR ARE THEY TRUE BELIEVERS? THEONES THAT --
DO THEY REALLY BELIEVE THESYSTEM IS NOT CORRUPTED OR ARE
THEY AWARE OF PULLING THE LEVERSOF POWER TO ATTAIN?
YOU KNOW, THE LATEST CASE ISTHIS MENENDEZ INDICTMENT.
>> YOU KNOW, THE WAY I SEE IT ISTHAT POWERFUL CORPORATIONS, RICH
PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT IFYOU CAN BEND THE GOVERNMENT TO
HELP YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT, IT'SA TREMENDOUS PAYOFF, AND IF YOU
CAN BEND IT TO HELP YOU JUST ALITTLE BIT MORE AND A LITTLE BIT
MORE, THE PLAYING FIELD JUSTGETS MORE AND MORE TILTED
AND THE RICH AND THE POWERFULJUST DO BETTER AND BETTER.
SO THEY'VE INVESTED INWASHINGTON.
THEY'VE INVESTED IN WASHINGTONIN CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT THEY'VE
INVESTED IN WASHINGTON IN AMILLION OTHER WAYS.
THE LOBBYISTS ARE THERE EVERYDAY, EVERY MEETING THAT OCCURS,
THEY'RE THERE IN THE REGULATORYAGENCIES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY'RE THERE ALL OVER THETOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
TENDER FANNIES OF THE RICH ANDPOWERFUL ARE ALWAYS CAREFULLY
PROTECTED IN EVERY RULETHAT'S WRITTEN,
IN EVERY CONVERSATION, INEVERY DISCUSSION. AND IT'S --
>> Jon: BUT DOES THAT NOLONGER FEEL LIKE CORRUPTION TO
THEM? DOES IT, YOU KNOW, INTHE WAY THAT CITIZENS UNITED
AND THE SUPREME COURT SAYING IFIT'S NOT QUID PRO QUO,
IF THEY DON'TSAY, HERE'S A GIANT BAG OF MONEY
AND YOU TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOUWANT TO DO, UNLESS IT'S THAT
EXPLICIT, THEY'RE SUGGESTINGTHAT IS NO LONGER CORRUPTION.
THIS MENENDEZ CASE THIS, GUYGAVE HIM $500,000.
HE HELPED NEGOTIATE MILLIONS OFDOLLARS IN CONTRACTS IN THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
DO THEY LOOK AT IT AS THAT'SGOVERNMENT?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THEPROBLEM WE'VE GOT IS THAT THERE
IS SO MUCH MONEY FLOWING INTOWASHINGTON, SO MUCH POWER,
SO MANY LOBBYISTS -- >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT IT BECOMES THE NORM.
AND I WANT TO SAY IT THIS WAY,
THE WIND ONLY BLOWS FROM ONEDIRECTION, IT ONLY BLOWS FROM
THE DIRECTION OF THOSEWHO HAVE MONEY.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOUREMEMBER, BUT A LONG TIME AGO
I WAS ON THIS PROGRAM TOTALK ABOUT AN IDEA FOR
A CONSUMER AGENCY.
>> Jon: I DON'T WATCH THISPROGRAM SO I DON'T --
>> IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM!
YOU WOULD LIKE IT.
>> Jon: TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IFIND IT A LITTLE CRASS.
>> WELL, ONE OF THE BETTEREPISODES --
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THATTHE BIG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
HAD BASICALLY JUST CHEATEDFAMILIES.
THEY HAD DONE IT ON MORTGAGES --
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THEY HAD DONE IT ON CREDITCARDS, PAYDAY LOANS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND THE PROBLEM WASN'T THATTHERE WASN'T ANY LAW FOR THIS.
THERE WERE A LOT OF LAWS, BUTTHEY WERE SCATTERED AMONG
SEVEN DIFFERENTAGENCIES.
AND NO AGENCY REALLYFELT RESPONSIBLE.
ALL THE AGENCIES ALL HEARD FROMTHE BIG BANKS AND NEVER FROM
THE FAMILIES.
SO I HAD AN IDEA FOR A CONSUMERAGENCY.
GATHER UP ALL THOSE LAWS, PUTTHEM WITH ONE AGENCY, GIVE THAT
AGENCY THE AUTHORITY TO GETTHE JOB DONE, TO LEVEL
THE PLAYING FIELD ON BEHALFOF THE FAMILIES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THENHOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKEDTO HEAR THIS BUT THE BIG BANKS
REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT IDEA.
>> Jon: WHAT!
>> IT COST MONEY.
>> Jon: BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN,FORGET ABOUT THE BIG BANKS,
CONGRESS DIDN'T EVENWANT TO FUND IT!
>> SO WHERE WE STARTED WITHTHIS IS --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE DIDN'T HAVE THE AGENCY ATALL AND THE QUESTION WAS COULD
WE GET THIS AGENCYPASSED INTO LAW.
I TALKED TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLEIN WASHINGTON -- THIS WAS,
YOU KNOW, I WAS A PROFESSOR. IHAD NO --
>> Jon: RIGHT. AT THAT TIME YOUWERE NOT IN ANYWAY,
YOU WERE NOT A SENATOR. RIGHT.
>> SO, I'M NOT A SENATOR, I'MNOT CONNECTED IN ANY WAY,
I GO AROUND AND TALK TO PEOPLEAND THEY TELL ME TWO THINGS.
THEY TELL ME, ONE, THAT IS AGREAT IDEA, YOU CAN ACTUALLY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH AN AGENCYLIKE THAT AND, TWO, DON'T DO IT.
THEY SAID, DON'T EVEN TRYBECAUSE THE BIG BANKS WILL SHUT
THIS DOWN.
I KNOW 100%!
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT HERE'S THE DEAL! HERE'STHE DEAL.
WE FOUGHT BACK AND GOTORGANIZED.
I DID CONFERENCE CALLS.FIRST CONFERENCE CALL I EVER DID
ON THIS CONSUMER AGENCY HADTHREE PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK
THAT LEGALLY QUALIFIES AS ACONFERENCE CALL --
>> Jon: NO, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'SNOT.
>> BUT FROM THERE WE GOTORGANIZED.
WE STARTED GETTING THEGROUPS LIKE, GOD BLESS THEM,
LIKE AARP, AND CONSUMER REPORTS,THE AFL-CIO.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THE NAACP AND LA RAZA ANDTHEY ALL SAID,
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRSTISSUE BUT THIS STUFF ABOUT
CHEATING CONSUMERS, IT COMESSOMEWHERE IN THE THINGS WE CARE
ABOUT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY GOT ORGANIZED.
MORE THAN 100 GROUPS GOTORGANIZED INTO AMERICANS FOR
FINANCIAL REFORM.
THEY PUSHED AND WE GOT THATCONSUMER AGENCY PASSED INTO LAW.
WE DID IT.
PEOPLE DID IT.
WE WORKED HARD AND DID IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK.
I WANT TO GET INTO THE STUDENTLOAN THING.
WE'LL BE BACK.
MORE FROM SENATOR WARRENRIGHT AFTER THIS.
