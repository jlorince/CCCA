THE TRUTH IS FOR MOSTREPUBLICANS, IMPEACHMENT IS
PROBABLY TOO GOOD FOR THISPRESIDENT.
>> HE DECLARED HIMSELF KINGOBAMA.
>> THIS KING COMPLEX.>> TYRANICAL DESPOT.
>> HE'S BECOME A MONARCH. OR ANEMPEROR.
>> A DICTATORSHIP.>> MY GOD, HE'S A TYRANT.
>> TEA PARTIERS KNEW IN THECOLONIES THAT KING GEORGE'S
DICTATORIAL METHODS WOULDN'T BETOLERATED.
WE WON'T TOLERATE THEM HERE.
I'M RANDY WEBER AND DAMN PROUDTO BE AN AMERICAN.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WHY DO I GET THE
FEELING HE SHOUTS THAT WHEN HEJIZZES?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I'M RANDY WEBER.
I'M DAMN PROUD TO BE AN -- OH,SON OF A BITCH.
OH, MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE,SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY.
[LAUGHTER]ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I'M QUITE THE ACERBICSOCIAL CRITIC.
[LAUGHTER]ALL RIGHT, RANDY WEBER, DAMN
PROUD AMERICAN THERE, I DIDN'TREALIZE THE LEVEL OF DESPOTISM
OF OBAMA WAS SO GREAT.
I'M CONVINCED.
LET'S RID OURSELVES OF THETYRANT.
>> WE DO NEED TO DO THISMETHODICALLY AND CORRECTLY AND
DO IT IN THE RIGHT WAY, SO IDON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL THAT
WE IMPEACH HIM RIGHT NOW, BUT HEDEFINITELY DESERVES IT.
>> WAIT.
WHAT?
HUH? BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT
KING GEORGE IS PROUD TO BE ANAMERICAN.
ARE YOU AMERICAN RANDY WEBER ORNOT?
PATRICK HENRY DIDN'T SAY, GIVEME LIBERTY OR IF NOT NOW, IT'S
FINE, I UNDERSTAND.
WE'RE BUSY.
COME ON!
DON'T TELL ME YOU CAN'T SQUEEZEONE LITTLE TYRANT IMPEACHMENT
INTO YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE OF NOTPASSING LAWS.
[LAUGHTER]WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE?
>> I THINK THAT GETS TO BE A BITOF A DISTRACTION, JUST LIKE THE
IMPEACHMENT OF BILL CLINTON DID.
>> NOTHING WOULD FIRE UP THEBASE OF THE DEMOCRATS MORE THAN
AN IMPEACHMENT ACTION.
THAT IT WOULD TURN OFF SOME OFTHE INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE RIGHT
NOW LEANING OUR WAY.
>> Jon: YEAH, AND ALL THAT ISHOW YOU KNOW ALL THIS TALK OF
TYRANNY IS BULL [BLEEPED].
BECAUSE WHEN YOUR MAIN CONCERNABOUT DEPOSING A TYRANT IS HOW
IT WILL AFFECT YOUR PARTY'SCHANCES IN THE UPCOMING MID-TERM
ELECTIONS, THAT'S NOT TYRANNY.
[LAUGHTER]APPARENTLY REPUBLICANS CAN'T
IMPEACH OBAMA.
THEY CAN'T BEAT HIM IN ANELECTION.
THEY DEFINITELY CAN'T WORK WITHHIM.
WHAT'S LEFT DO?
USE SNAPCHAT TO DRAW A DONG ONHIS FACE?
I MEAN, YEAH, IT WILL MAKEYOU FEEL BETTER.
BUT, WHOA, SWIPE IT TO THE LEFT.
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHINGMORE EFFECTIVE THAN IMPEACHMENT,
SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTALLYAMERICAN.
>> SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHNBOEHNER SAID HE PLANS TO SUE THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ON BEHALFOF THE G.O.P.-CONTROLLED
CONGRESS.
>> REALLY?
YOU THINK, YOU THINK THIS ISGOING TO FLY IN COURT?
REALLY?
[LAUGHTER]LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
ALL PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO DO ISTHROW HIS BRIEFCASE DOWN
UNEXPECTEDLY.
YOU TURN YOUR NECK.
CASE DISMISSED.
BOOM.
THANK YOU, MIKE BRADY, ATTORNEYAT LAW.
I'M OLD.
[LAUGHTER]BUT ENOUGH TALK.
LET'S GET TO THE ACTION.
WHAT ARE WE SUING OBAMA FOR?
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE? THEFAST AND FURIOUS, THE
BENGHAZI, THE IRS, THE FLOATINGMUSLIM TERRORIST BLIMP?
OOPS.
>> THE SUIT HAS TO DO WITH THEPRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN
2013 POSTPONING THE MANDATE INTHE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT
REQUIRES LARGE EMPLOYERS TOPROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE TO
THEIR EMPLOYEES.
>> Jon: WAIT.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
THE G.O.P. IS GOING TO TAKE DOWNOUR DICTATOR IN CHIEF WITH A
CIVIL SUIT ACCUSING HIM OF NOTPROPERLY EXECUTING A LAW THEY
THEMSELVES HAVE TRIED MORE THAN50 TIMES TO PARTLY OR COMPLETELY
REPEAL?
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL TAKE IT.
WHETHER THIS LAWSUIT HAS ANYMERIT, WHETHER IT'S A GOOD CHECK
ON EXECUTIVE POWER, I DON'TKNOW.
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.
BUT AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST TIMETHE TWO SIDES WILL BE FORCED TO
DEAL WITH EACH OTHER.
EVEN IF IT'S THROUGH THEIRLAWYERS.
FINALLY WE THE PEOPLE WILL BEREPRESENTED BY OUR ELECTED
REPRESENTATIVES' LEGALREPRESENTATION.
AS THE FOUNDING FATHERSENVISIONED, WHEN THEY WERE
TRIPPING ON MUSHROOMS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
