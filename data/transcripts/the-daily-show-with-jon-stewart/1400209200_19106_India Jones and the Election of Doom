NO MATTER WHO BECOMES INDIA'SNEXT PRIME MINISTER, THEIR
ELECTION WILL HAVE GLOBALCONSEQUENCES.
OUR OWN JASON JONES HAS MORE.
>> Jason: INDIA IS HAVING ANELECTION. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
TOLD IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE TOVISIT. BUT I'D RATHER AVOID
DYSENTERY IN 120 DEGREEWEATHER. SO INSTEAD I WENT
TO THE INDIA CONSULATE IN NEWYORK AND MET WITH AMBASSADOR --
(MISPRONOUNCING NAME) -- I METWITH THE AMBASSADOR.
MR. AMBASSADOR, I AM NOT AT ALLEMBARASSED TO ADMIT THAT I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT INDIA.
>> YEAH, WELL IT'S ALWAYS GOODTO START.
>> I HEAR YOU GUYSARE HAVING A LITTLE ELECTION.
>> YES. INDIA IS ACTUALLY THEGREATEST DEMOCRACY IN THEWORLD.
>> NO, THAT'S THE UNITED STATESOF AMERICA.
THAT IS THE GREATESTDEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD.
>> NO, HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT?
>> Jason: OH, I DON'T KNOW, 121MILLION PEOPLE VOTING IN OUR
LAST ELECTION.
>> AND WE HAVE 814 MILLIONREGISTERED VOTERS.
>> Jason: OK, BUT THAT'S,THAT'S, THAT'S IN RUPEES.
HOW MANY IN AMERICAN?
>> I THINK WE DON'T CONVERTPEOPLE INTO RUPEES AND DOLLARS.
>> I KNOW WHY YOU KNOW SO MUCHABOUT US BECAUSE WE'RE THE BEST.
BUT, WHY DON'T WE KNOW ANYTHINGABOUT YOU?
>> YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'TUNDERSTAND INDIA IN ONE LIFE.
A PERSON SAY FROM TAMILNADU IN THE SOUTH WOULD NOT
UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OFSOMEBODY IN THE NORTHEAST.
MY WIFE OFTEN THINKS WHEN I SAY NO, SHE THINK IT'S YES.
>> Jason: HOW DO YOU SAY NO?
>> I SAY IT LIKE THIS.

ANOTHER LEVEL IT'SVERY, VERY FASCINATING.
>> Jason: WELL, AMBASSADOR, IFYOUR ELECTIONS ARE SO
FASCINATING THENWHY IS THIS ALL I CAN FIND ABOUT
INDIA ON AMERICAN TELEVISION?
>> GOOD RICE, GOOD CURRY, GOODGANDHI, LET'S HURRY.
>> THE COVERAGE HERE IS,I WOULD SAY, LOPSIDED.
IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THECOMPLEXITY, IT DOESN'T CAPTURE
THE ENTHUSIASM OF INDIAN PEOPLE.
IT'S, IT'S, IT'S SOMETHING THATYOU MUST SEE TO BELIEVE.
>> Jason: PLEASE DO NOT DAREME TO GO TO INDIA.
>> THIS IS REALLY A FASCINATINGELECTION.
>> Jason: DON'T MAKE ME GO TOINDIA.
>> NO, YOU MUST GO.
>> Jason: BUT, I DON'T WANT TOGO.
>> SITTING BEHIND A DESK IN THEU.S., AND
APPRECIATING OR UNDERSTANDINGINDIAN ELECTIONS IS ALMOST NEXT
TO IMPOSSIBLE.
>> Jason: OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,PAL?
I AM GOING TO GO FIND SOMEONEWHO IS WILLING TO TRAVEL TO

WHOA, TOO MANY DRONES THERE.
THERE WE GO. DELHI.JUST ONE LOOK AT THE CHAOS OF
INDIA'S CAPITAL CITY AND ITWAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO WAY THIS
DEMOCRACY COULD EQUALOURS. FOR EXAMPLE,
IN THE U.S. YOU ARE FREE TOCHOOSE ONE OF TWO PARTIES AND IN
INDIA YOU HOLY (bleep) THERE'S ALOT OF CHOICES.
OK, BUT IN AMERICA, A STAGGERING23% OF OUR YOUTH PLAN ON VOTING
IN OUR NEXT ELECTIONS.
MATCH THAT, INDIA.

YOUTH IS A LITTLE MOREENGAGED THAN OURS.
BUT IN AMERICA, OUR POLITICIANSKNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO EACH

BUT, THE REAL WORK IS BEGINNING.
BECAUSE EVERYWHERE I WENT ININDIA, EVERYONE HAD AN OPINION
ON POLITICS.

LONG LINE OF GUYS I'VE GOT TOGET TO.
