MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE HAVEA VERY FINE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ALLISONWILLIAMS OF "GIRLS" FAME.
SHE IS THE REMARKABLEDAUGHTER OF ONE REALLY
UNREMARKABLE MAN.
(LAUGHTER)I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW TONIGHT, OUT OF RESPECT FORNEW MASS TRANSIT ORDINANCES HERE
IN NEW YORK CITY, I AM BEHIND MYDESK, I AM ACTUALLY MAN
SQUEEZING.
(WHISTLING)(APPLAUSE)
I HAVE, I HAVE BEEN INFORMEDTHERE ARE SOME GENTLEMEN ON THE
SUBWAY WHO BELIEVE THAT A RIDETO WORK IS THE TIME TO VENTILATE
THE BOYS.
I THINK THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, ITHINK THAT'S AN INCORRECT -- YOU
KNOW, ONCE YOU GET TO THEOFFICE, LET 'EM LOOSE.
HAVE SOME FUN. BUT ON THE WAYTO WORK, I CAN CERTAINLY
UNDERSTAND WHY YOUMAY WANT TO KEEP THAT, KEEP IT
TIGHT, KEEP IT CLEAN, LET OTHERPEOPLE SIT THERE
WITHOUT WATCHING YOU SMUGGLEPLUMS INTO THE SUBWAY SYSTEM.
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS, BUT LET'S --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOODEXERCISE.
BUT FOLKS, LET'S BEGINTONIGHT WITH NEW SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER MITCHARD McCONNELL! ASMANY OF YOU KNOW,
BENEATH HIS HARDENED EXTERIORAND LOVE OF ALL THINGS
LETTUCE --(LAUGHTER)
-- AND SEASONALLY-DRIVEN,SAND-BASED SPAWNING RUNS --
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S A SCIENTIFICFACT, THAT MAN IS A TURTLE.
HE IS A TURTLE AND THE FIRSTOF HIS KIND TO HOLD THIS HIGH OF
AN ELECTED OFFICE -- BUT BENEATHTHAT LIES THE HEART OF AN ARDENT
CRITIC OF PRESIDENT BARACKOBAMA'S ECONOMIC POLICIES.
>> YOU DO HAVE TO WONDER,THOUGH, WHETHER THE STIMULUS HAS
HAD ANY IMPACT AT ALL.
A BILL THAT WAS MEANT TO REIGNIN WALL STREET.
BUT WHICH IS WIDELY EXPECTED TOSTIFLE GROWTH.
TAX INCREASES ARE A JOB KILLER.
THIS IS CERTAINLY THE MOSTANTI-BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
SINCE THE CARTER YEARS.
>> 2 MILLION FEWER JOBS WILL BECREATED AS A RESULT OF
OBAMACARE.
SPENDING AND BORROWING ANDTAXING AND REGULATION AND
TEPID GROWTH!
>> Jon: I MEAN, IT'S JUST AWFUL.
THIS PRESIDENT'S ECONOMICSTEWARDSHIP HAS BORNE A
WASTELAND OF SHUDDEREDBUSINESSES, ABANDONED FACTORIES,
STORES THAT SELL BUT MISERY.
MARAUDING HORDES OF UNEMPLOYEDAMERICANS SUBSIST BUT ON COPPER
WIRE AND OLD HOPE POSTERS.
WISHING, WISHING FOR THEPROMISED DEATH PANELS TO END
THEIR SOCIALIST MISERY -- ANDYET --
>> THE AMERICAN ECONOMYNOW GROWING FASTER THAN WE'VE
SEEN IN OVER A DECADE.
>> THE INCREDIBLE DOLLAR RALLYCONTINUING.
>> THE GDP SOARED.
>> THE BEST PACED OVERALL JOBGROWTH.
>> UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FELL IN 41STATES LAST MONTH.
>> Jon: YOUR HEAD'S STILL OUTOF YOUR NECK HOLE!
(LAUGHTER)HOW DOTH YOU EXPLAIN THAT OH
AMPHIBIOUS ONE?
>> AFTER SO MANY YEARS OFSLUGGISH GROWTH, WE FINALLY
STARTING TO SEE SOME ECONOMICDATA THAT CAN PROVIDE A
GLIMMER OF HOPE.
THE UPTICK SEEMS TO COINCIDEWITH THE BIGGEST
POLITICAL CHANGE OBAMAADMINISTRATION'S LONG TENURE
IN WASHINGTON.
THE EXPECTATION OF A NEWREPUBLICAN CONGRESS.
>> Jon: OH MY, ARE YOU -- COMEON!
YOU HAVE BEEN IN CONTROL OF THESENATE FOR TWO DAYS!
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S BARELY ENOUGH TIME FOR A
GRIZZLED COP AND A FASTTALKING SMALL-TIME CRIMINAL TO
TRACK DOWN SOME ESCAPEDMURDERERS IN THE HARD
SCRABBLED STREETS OF SAN FERN -ANGLES. I DON'T, I DON'T
REMEMBER WHERE THE --
UNLESS MY CALENDAR IS BROKEN,SENATOR.
WHICH IS POSSIBLE, SINCE IBOUGHT IT AT THE DISCOUNT
CALENDAR FACTORY.
THE GENERAL ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTTREND STARTED BEFORE THE
NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.
BUT THANKFULLY THE REPUBLICANSENATE MAJORITY UNDER MITCH
McCONNELL CAME TO OURRESCUE AND SAVED THE ECONOMY
RETROACTIVELY? IT'S EASY TOASSUME THAT MITCH McCONNELL
IS SAYING THAT PEOPLE FELT SOINSPIRED BY THE MOMENT THAT
HE SWITCHED THE NAMEPLATEON HIS OFFICE DOOR,
THAT THEY INVENTED TIME TRAVELAND WENT BACK TO 2009
AND STARTED SPENDING AND HIRINGAGAIN.
BUT THE TRUTH IS ACTUALLY MUCHSIMPLER.
THE TRUTH IS THIS -- AND ITWILL BLOW YOUR MINDS -- IF YOU
RUB MITCH MCCONNELL'S SHELL --(LAUGHTER)
-- YOU WILL RECEIVE FIVE YEARSOF BUSINESS GROWTH.
A LIMITED GENIE.
IT TAKES HIM 40 MINUTES TO GETTHROUGH A SONG.
♪ YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIENDLIKE ME ♪♪
(LAUGHTER)BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE ON THE HOT
ROLE.
ARE THERE ANY OTHERLONG-STANDING PROBLEMS THE
REPUBLICAN SENATE HAS SUDDENLYAND SINGLE-HANDEDLY FIXED?
>> A FLAG LOWERING CEREMONYSUNDAY MARKED THE END OF U.S.
COMBAT MISSIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.
AFTER 13 YEARS, OPERATIONENDURING FREEDOM IS OVER.
>> AMERICA'S LONGEST WAR ENDEDWITH THE FAINTEST OF WHIMPERS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE -- WAR ISOVER! THE AFGHAN WAR
IS OFFICIALLY OVER AND ITSOUNDED LIKE THE COMMENTATOR
THERE IS UPSET IT DIDN'T GOOUT WITH MORE OF A BANG.
IT ENDED WITH A WHIMPER.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TOENDING A WAR WITH A GOOD OLD
FASHIONED A-BOMB? NOWTHERE'S A SHOWSTOPPER.
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT'SGOT SOME PIZZAZZ!
BY THE WAY, A 13-YEAR-OLDCONFLICT, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS --IT'S AFGHANISTAN'S
WAR MITZVAH.
(LAUGHTER)CONGRATULATIONS.
TODAY YOU ARE A QUAGMIRE.
WELL, I KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S GOTTO BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
GUY'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENDINGTHE WAR SINCE HE WAS A
LITTLE PUP.
>> NEXT WEEK, WE WILL BE ENDINGOUR COMBAT MISSION IN
AFGHANISTAN.
OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF THEEXTRAORDINARY SERVICE OF THE MEN
AND WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMEDFORCES.
>> Jon: I'M NOT SAYING YOU'VEGOT TO GET ON AN AIRCRAFT
CARRIER WHEN YOU'RE ENDING AWAR.
BUT CAN YOU AT LEAST DELIVER THENEWS IN A ROOM WITHOUT BOOTHS?
(LAUGHTER)MIGHT AS WELL BE BANGING OUT THE
ANNOUNCEMENT IN A GROUND ROUND.
(LAUGHTER)C'MON, PEOPLE!
THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT.
LET'S TRY KEEPING THE PEANUTSHELLS IN THE BOWL,
NOT THE FLOOR!
TRYING TO END A WAR OVER HERE!
ANYWAY, PACK UP THE BAGS, FOLKS.
IT'S FINALLY THE END OF"OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM."
LOWER-CASE "FREEDOM,"LARGE FONT, ALL-CAPS "ENDURING."
NOT SOMETHING THE PRESIDENTWOULD ANNOUNCE, IF THIS WASN'T A
HUGE DRAMATIC SHIFT IN POLICY.
>> THERE IS NOT A HUGE DRAMATICSHIFT.
>> WHAT?
ENDING A WAR SOUNDSPRETTY DRAMATIC!
YOU HEARD HIM. MAYBENOT "LES MIS" DRAMATIC,
BUT IT'S A SOLID "PHANTOM,"RIGHT?
>> THERE ARE STILL GONNA BE11,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS
REMAINING IN THE COUNTRY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS APPROVEDBROADENING THE CAMPAIGN BEYOND
PREVIOUS PLANS.
>> AUTHORIZING THE USE OFU.S. FIGHTER JETS, BOMBERS AND
DRONES.
>> THERE WILL BE U.S. FORCES WHOWILL STILL BE SEEING COMBAT.
>> PROVIDING AIR AND GROUNDSUPPORT FOR AT LEAST TWO MORE
YEARS.
>> MILITARY OFFICIALS RETIREDTHE N.A.T.O. FLAG IN A
CEREMONY IN KABUL ON SUNDAYAND REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER
REPRESENTING A NEW MISSION.
>> Jon: SO THE CHANGE ISLITERALLY SYMBOLIC.
YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE THE FLAGAND EXPECT PEOPLE TO GET ON
BOARD.
THIS BETTER BE THE MOSTINSPIRATIONAL OPERATION FLAG
OF -- OH, OKAY. I DIDN'T --
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL STAY.
I SUPPOSE, IN RETROSPECT, THEREWAS ONE PRETTY FAIL-SAFE SIGN
THAT WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BELEAVING IN 2014.
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TOTALLYOUT OF THERE, COME HELL OR HIGH
WATER, BY 2014.
WE ARE LEAVING.
WE ARE LEAVING IN 2014, PERIOD.
>> Jon: WE ARE LEAVING,PERIOD!
IF BY "PERIOD" I MEAN "COMMA,"PSYCH!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
