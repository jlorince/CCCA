>> Jon: WELLCOME BACK.
GOVERNMENT OVERREACH HAS BEEN ACONTROVERSIAL ISSUE OF LATE.
WHETHER THIS IS ONE OF THOSECASES, I'M NOT REALLY SURE.
AL MADRIGAL FILED THIS REPORT.
>> IN 2008, LOUISIANA CAME TOITS SENSES AND OUTLAWED THE
BARBARIC SPORT OF COCK FIGHTING.AND THE CHICKENS OF THAT STATE
FINALLY HAD SOME PEACE. STATESENATOR ELBERT GUILLORY.
>> WE'VE OUTLAWED COCK FIGHTING.
THOSE BLOOD SPORTS ARE NO LONGERATTRACTIVE IN LOUISIANA.
I AM NOT A FAN OF COCK FIGHTING,BUT I'D LOVE TO GO AND WATCH
SOME CHICKEN BOXING.
>> I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHTTHERE. YOU JUST SAID
"CHICKEN BOXING"?
>> YES, CHICKEN BOXING INLOUISIANA IS STILL NOT LEGAL,
BUT WE'RE FIGHTING TO MAKE ITLEGAL.
>> YOU MEANT TO SAY CHICKENBOXING?
>> I MEANT TO SAY CHICKENBOXING.
HUMAN BEINGS PUT GLOVES ONAND BOX.
CHICKENS CAN PUT GLOVES ON ANDBOX.
>> RIGHT.
HE'S TRYING TO LEGALIZE CHICKENBOXING, WHICH IS TOTALLY
DIFFERENT THAN COCKFIGHTING.
WAIT.
MAYBE THAT IS COCKFIGHTING.
ALL RIGHT.
SWITCH 'EM AROUND.
THAT'S CHICKEN BOXING AND THAT'SCOCKFIGHTING?
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHICKENBOXING.
>> WHAT?
WHAT ARE THESE?
>> THESE ARE CHICKEN BOXINGGLOVES.
>> SO COCKFIGHTING VICIOUS?
>> MANY PEOPLE SAY SO.
>> BUT PLUS THIS, ADORABLE.
>> ABSOLUTELY A SAFE SPORT, IT'SA FAMILY SPORT.
>> SO NO COCKFIGHTING AND NOCHICKEN BOXING.
WHAT'S NEXT, NO CHICKENWRESTLING?
IF IT WERE UP TO PEOPLE LIKEJ.P. MORRELL, THE CHICKENS
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FUN.
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUARM THEM WITH, TWO CHICKENS
GOING INTO A RING AND FIGHTINGFOR THE AMUSEMENT OF PEOPLE IS
WRONG.
>> IT'S TWO ADULT CONSENSUALCHICKENS THAT ARE FIGHTING ON
THE BEHALF OF BLOODTHIRSTYHUMANS.
>> CHICKENS DO NOT HAVEFREEWILL, THEREFORE...
>> CHICKENS ARE SMART.
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION,SMART AS A CHICKEN.
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD IT. I DON'TTHINK IT'S A THING.
>> MY DAD ALWAYS USED TO ALWAYSSAY, "AL, YOU'RE SMART AS A
CHICKEN." AND I USED TO SAY,"THANKS, DAD."
>> I DON'T THINK THAT WAS ACOMPLIMENT.
[LAUGHTER]>> IT WAS. IT WAS.
IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.
IT DEFINITELY WAS A COMPLIMENT.
BUT THESE SMART CHICKENS ARETREATED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN
THEIR HUMAN COUNTERPARTS.
>> THEY HAVE THE BEST FOOD.
THEY HAVE THE BEST MEDICAL CARE.
THEIR TRAINERS GIVE THEMMASSAGES.
THESE ARE PREMIER ATHLETES.
>> WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUTCHICKEN BOXING, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND THESE CHICKENS USE THEBEST FACILITIES, LIKE THIS
HALLOWED HALL OF POULTRYPUGILISM.
IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE WHERE THELEGENDS OF THE SPORT WENT TALLON
TO TALLON, LIKE WHEN MANNYPECK-QUAIO TOOK ON
FLOYD MAYFEATHER. OR WHEN SUGARSHANE POULTRY KNOCKED OUT,
I DON'T KNOW, EVANDERHOLYFRIED?
I'M RUNNING OUT OF[BLEEPED] CHICKEN PUNS.
>> THIS IS WHERE THE PRIMARYCOMBATANTS GO TO IT.
NO ONE HAD TO FORCE THEM.
NO ONE HAD TO ENCOURAGE THEM.
>> I MEAN, YOU BROUGHT THEM INAND PUT THEM IN THERE, BUT OTHER
THAN THAT...
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> STILL THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKESENATOR MORELL WHO WANT TO TURN
THEIR BACK ON THIS NOBLEPASTIME.
>> I AM NOT DEPRIVING CHICKENSOF A BETTER LIFE.
I'M SAVING THEIR LIVES BY NOTLETTING THEM...
>> OKAY.
I'M A CHICKEN.
TELL ME WHY SHOULDN'T FIGHT?
>> YOU SHOULDN'T FIGHT FOR THEAMUSEMENT OF OTHERS.
IT'S BARBARIC, IT'S STUPID ANDTHERE IS A BETTER LIFE FOR YOU.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLYDID THAT.
I'M A CHICKEN.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU[BLEEPED] SAID.
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.
YOU'RE A SENATOR.
A SENATOR WHO DOESN'T SEE THEECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY CLAWING HIM
IN THE FACE.
>> THESE BIRDS, WARRIOR BIRDS,SELL FOR ANYWHERE BETWEEN $2,500
AND $25,000.
>> WHAT?
>> THAT IS REAL MONEY.
>> SO SUCK IT, "DAILY SHOW"NEWSROOM, AND WORLD, PLEASE SAY
HELLO TO OSCAR DELAY POLLO.
>> COME ON, OSCAR.
WORK THE BAG, WORK THE BAG.
COME ON, OSCAR.
