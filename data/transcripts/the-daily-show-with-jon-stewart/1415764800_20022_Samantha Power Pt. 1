>> Jon: AND YOU WERE OBSERVINGTHE UNITED NATIONS RESPONSE OR
THE U.S. RESPONSE TO EBOLA.

YOU SHOOK MY HAND!>> IT'S TRUE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: ARE YOU EXCITED NEW
YORKERS CAN ONCE AGAINLICK THE SUBWAYS?
>> MAYBE AFTERWARDS I'LL HEAD TOTHE SUBWAY.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T WANT ANYPART OF THAT.
SO WHAT DID YOU FIND?
ARE WE GETTING A HANDLING ONTHIS EPIDEMIC WITHIN AFRICA?
>> BASICALLY, WE ARE BUILDINGTHE AIRPLANE AS WE FLY IT AND IT
HAS NOT BEEN PRETTY AT ALLTIMES.
PEOPLE ARE LEARNING A LOT ASTHEY GO ABOUT WHAT EBOLA IS,
WHAT IT ISN'T.
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE, IN REMOTEAREAS OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE
THERE ARE NO ROADS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHERE THERE HAVEN'T BEENCLINICS IN A LONG TIME.
>> Jon: CIVIL WAR, THEY'RERACKED WITH YEARS OF CIVIL WAR.
>> EXACTLY. AND JUST AS THESECOUNTRIES WERE RECOVERING FROM
THOSE WARS, HERE COMES EBOLA.
BUT THE RESPONSE ACTUALLY HASBEEN REMARKABLE AND PARTICULARLY
IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKSWE'VE STARTED TOO SEE THE
RETURN ON THE INVESTMENTS THATWE HAVE BEEN MAKING.
SO SAFE BURIAL WHICH IS A HUGELYIMPORTANT PART OF A RESPONSE...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WAS DISASTROUS.
THE BURIAL PRACTICES THAT PEOPLEHAD WERE THE MAIN REASON --
>> Jon: NOW THIS IS BECAUSE THEBODY BECOMES INCREDIBLY
INFECTIOUS THE WORSE THE DISEASEGETS.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO IF SOMEBODY PASSESAWAY, THEIR BODY IS STILL IN
SOME WAYS ACTIVEWITH THE DISEASE.
>> CORRECT. AND IN THE CULTURE,THE DESIRE TO EMBRACE THE BODY
AND ALL KINDS OF RITUALSASSOCIATED WITH THIS
TRADITIONAL BURIAL RITES...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WERE REALLY FUELING THESPREAD OF THE EPIDEMIC.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> C.D.C. THINKS AS MANY AS 70%OF INFECTIONS WERE COMING FROM
UNSAFE BURIAL.
>> Jon: OH FOR GOODNESS SAKES,THAT'S TRAGIC. RIGHT.
>> BUT, JUST THREE WEEKS AGO THESAFE BURIAL RATE IN FREETOWN,
THE CAPITAL OF SIERRALEONE WAS ABOUT 30%.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT BAD WITHIN24 HOURS OF A DEATH.
NOW IT'S CLOSE TO 100%, ABOUT98%.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> SAME IN MONROVIA WHERE THEU.S. HAS SENT 2,000 TROOPS,
THEY'RE NOW FANNING ACROSS THECOUNTRY, MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN
SAFE BURIAL.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, IF THAT CAN BE SCALED TOTHE COMMUNITIES IN THE RURAL
AREAS, WHICH ARE PRETTYHARD TO GET TO, SO IT'S NO EASY
TASK, YOU CAN SEE BENDING THECURVE.
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
>> Jon: BUT WE'VE DONE A GOODJOB HERE OF AT LEAST TRYING TO
DEMONIZE ANYONE WHO WOULD GOTHERE TO HELP.
(LAUGHTER)AND I THINK, IN THE WAY WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT DOCTORS WITHOUTBORDERS OR SOME OF
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVEGONE THERE AND TRY TO STEM,
WE'VE TRIED TO DO OUR BEST TOSHUN THEM WHEN THEY GET BACK.
HAS THAT HELPED? IS THAT?
(APPLAUSE)>> SHUNNING HEALTH WORKERS IS
NOT ON THE TOP OF C.D.C.'SLIST OF THINGS TO DO TO
CURE AN EPIDEMIC.
BUT WHAT WE DO NEED IS MOREDOCTORS, AND ONE OF THE THINGS
PEOPLE SAID IN THE REGIONIS HOW AMAZING IT WAS TO SEE
PRESIDENT OBAMA HUGGING NINAPHAM, TO SEE THE HEALTH WORKERS
AT THE WHITE HOUSE BEINGHEROIZED AS THEY SHOULD BE.
I MEAN, TO SEE THESEPEOPLE IN ACTION.
THEY'RE WEARING THESE SWELTERINGSUITS.
THEY CAN ONLY WORK FORTWO HOURS AT A TIME.
THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OFNOWHERE.
THEY'RE AWAY FROM THEIRFAMILIES.
>> Jon: NOW WHY, WHY IS IT TWOHOURS? IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE --
>> THE HEAT ANDOPPRESSION BASICALLY.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> I'M NOT DOING A GREAT JOB OFSELLING THE IDEA OF BECOMING A
HEALTH WORKER PREHAPS. BUT --
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO SO FAR I'MLIKING WHAT I'M HEARING.
(LAUGHTER)>> YEAH, YEAH. BUT IT'S AMAZING
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTINGTHEIR LIVES ON THE LINE,
DOING THIS FOR SIX-WEEKROTATIONS.
AND WE HAVE, THERE ARE SEVERALHUNDRED WORKERS WHO ARE IN THE
THREE COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW.>> Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THE U.N. ESTIMATES WENEED ABOUT A THOUSAND, AND
SO THAT WILL REQUIRE HOSPITALSAND FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES
RALLYING AROUND THEIDEA OF SENDING OUR MEDICAL --
>> Jon: DOES THEU.N. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,
DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TOTHOSE KINDS OF RESOURCES OR DOES
IT HAVE TO COME FROM N.G.O.s ANDOTHER GROUPS ON THE
GROUND?
DO THEY HAVE THAT AS PART OFTHEIR INFRASTRUCTURE?
>> THERE'S NO STANDING ARMY OFDOCTORS WEARING BLUE HELMETS
JUST WAITING TO DEPLOY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WHY IS THAT?
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT WECOULD PROPOSE?
>> I THINK OUT OF THIS CRISISTHERE WILL BE A LOT OF LEARNING.
WE'RE, RIGHT NOW WE'RESTILL BUILDING THAT PLANE AND
TRYING TO LAND IT, BUT WE WILLNEED TO ESTABLISH I THINK
ROSTERS OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSIN THE EVENT OF MAJOR OUTBREAKS
LIKE THIS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE GREAT THING IS, IFTHERE'S ANYTHING GREAT IS TO BE
SAID ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE WILLHAVE BUILT MUSCLE MEMORY THAT WE
NEVER HAVE BEFORE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I MEAN, FOR THE UNITED STATESTO SEND SEVERAL HUNDRED HEALTH
WORKERS OVER THE LAST -->> Jon: WE'LL HAVE EXPERIENCE IN
DEALING WITH THIS.
>> YEAH AND THEN THEY'LL TELLTHEIR COLLEAGUES AGAIN THAT IT
GIVES THEM SUCH A GREAT SENSEOF SATISFACTION.
I MEAN HERE, I WAS DESCRIBINGAGAIN THE EXPERIENCE OF WEARING
THESE SUITS AND BEING OUT IN THEHEAT AND TREATING THESE PEOPLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I'VE NEVER MET HEALTHPROFESSIONALS WHO DESCRIBED A
GREATER SENSE OF SATISFACTION.>> Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN, EVERY DOCTOR LOVES TOHEAL.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WELL, CERTAINLYNOT IN MY INSURANCE NETWORK
I HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY WHO LIKESTHAT.
(LAUGHTER)
ALRIGHT, SO, SO WE TALKED ABOUTEBOLA.
WE'LL COME BACK AND YOU CAN TALKABOUT HOW WE'RE FIXING I.S.I.S.
OR I.S.I.L OR THE DAESHOR WHATEVER THEY CALL THE
INDIVIDUALS TAKING OVERAPPARENTLY NOT JUST OUR
PLANET BUT THE UNIVERSE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MOREFROM AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER.
