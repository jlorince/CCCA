>> A PLANE LIKE THIS IS AROUND61, 62 METERS END TO END.
61-62 SIDE TO SIDE.
>> Jon: YOU ARE TELLING THEMWHAT A PLANE LOOKS LIKE?
[LAUGHTER]DID YOU FORGET WHO WATCHES CNN?
YOU COULD TELL 90% OF YOURVIEWERS LOOK OUT THE AIRPORT
WINDOW AT THE PLANE THEY AREABOUT TO GET ON.

AT AIRPORTS.
[LAUGHTER]OF COURSE MAN DOES NOT LIVE BYHOLOGRAM
ALONE. GIVE ME A SIX BOX,FLANK IT, NOW STUPID ME.

HOLES AND ON AND ON AND ON ANDALL OF THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES
NOHA SAYS WHAT ELSE CAN YOUTHINK? BLACK HOLE? BERMUDA
TRIANGLE? AND THEN DEJI SAYSIT'S JUST LIKE THE MOVIE LOST.
I KNOW IT'S PREPOSTEROUS BUT ISIT PREPOSTEROUS, DO YOU THINK,
MARY?

IT'S A TRAP.
[ LAUGHTER ] SOME SORT OFWEIRD BERMUDA TRIANGLE
OF LOGIC WHERE QUESTIONS AREANSWERED BEFORE THEY ARE ASKED.

SPECIALIZING IN MISSING PERSONS?

ALWAYS PREDICTS THE WORLD CUPVICTOR?
WHY DON'T WE STRAP SOME WINGS TOWOLF BLITZER AND LET HIM LOOSE
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO CATCH APLANE YOU MUST BECOME A PLANE.
