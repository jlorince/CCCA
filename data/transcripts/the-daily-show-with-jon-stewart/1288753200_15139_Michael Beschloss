>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, A RENOWNED
PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM MICHAEL BESCHLOSS.
SIR, HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
THANKS FOR COMING.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
( APPLAUSE )
TELL ME A STORY.
THE AS WHOOPING THAT HAS BEEN
DELIVERED TONIGHT TO THE
DEMOCRATS, THE MID-TERMS
TRADITIONALLY, WHATEVER RULING
PARTY IS THERE, LOSE SOME SEATS.
DO THEY USUALLY LOSE THIS MANY
SEATS?
>> NO, THEY DON'T, ALTHOUGH IT'S
HAPPENED IN THE PAST, AND I
THINK ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT
IS THAT SOMEONE TOLD ME THERE
MAY BE A COUPLE PEOPLE IN THE
AUDIENCE WHO ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT
TONIGHT.
ANYONE UNHAPPY WITH THE
REPUBLICAN VICTORY?
I GUESS THERE ARE A FEW.
>> Jon: THAT GENTLEMAN SEEMS
VERY HAPPY.
THAT WOMAN HAS A THUMBS-DOWN.
>> THIS IS NOT FOR HIM.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORY, THE
THREE PEOPLE, THE THREE
PRESIDENTS IN RECENT TIMES WHO
HAVE HAD MID-TERM LOSSES LIKE
THIS HAVE BEEN TRUMAN,
EISENHOWER AND BILL CLINTON.
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM GOT
REELECTED.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: SO... SO... SO YOUR
THOUGHT IS WHAT A GREAT NIGHT
FOR BARACK OBAMA.
>> SORT OF LIKE WHAT THE
HOLLYWOOD AGENT SAID WHEN ELVIS
DIED, "GREAT CAREER MOVE."
>> Jon: WHAT DID TRUMAN...
THEY'RE PROJECTING 60 SEATS.
IS THIS THE LARGEST, SECOND
LARGEST, THIRD LARGEST?
WHAT DO WE STAND IN
>> IT'S SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE.
THE THING ABOUT TRUEMAN, 1946,
HE LOST BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS,
FIRST TIME TO THE DEMOCRATS IN
16 YEARS, AND HE WAS PRETTY
PHILOSOPHICAL.
HE WAS COMING BACK THE
WASHINGTON ON A TRAIN, HAD A BIG
POKER GAME, DID NOT LISTEN TO
THE RETURNS AND GOT BACK HERE...
>> Jon: COULD YOU ROLL THAT BY
ME ONE MORE TIME.
HE DID NOT LISTEN TO THE
ELECTORAL RETURNS BECAUSE HE WAS
PLAYING CARDS.
>> I THINK THAT'S IT.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU THINK THAT
WOULD FLY IN TODAY'S
ENVIRONMENT?
>> WELL, SORT OF THEN MAYBE A
CONNECTION TO AQUA BUDDA.
>> Jon: PROBABLY RIGHT.
I TRIED THAT EARLIER, THEY'RE
NOT BIG ON THE AQUA BUDDA STUFF.
WHEN HE GOT BACK AND HExD REALIZED
HE LOST, WHAT DID HE THINK?
>> THIS WAS A GUY WHO WAS SECURE
IN HIMSELF.
AND HE WROTE HIS WIFE, "AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED, I'M GOING TO
DO WHATEVER I FEEL LIKE FOR NEXT
TWO YEARS AND TO HELL WITH
EVERYONE."
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: AND THAT'S HOW... DID
HE AT THAT POINT BEGIN TO LEAD?
IS THE MISTAKE THAT PRESIDENTS
MAKE IN THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS,
DO THEY LEAD LESS?
HERE'S THE THING I WANT TO ASK
YOU ABOUT BARACK OBAMA.
HE HAS BEEN A LEGISLATOR.
NOW HE'S AN EXECUTIVEMENT THEY
ARE DIFFERENT POSITIONS.
>> THEY ARE.
>>
>> Jon: HAS HE EXECUTIVED LIKE
A LEGISLATOR AND THEN DOES HE
USE THESE NEXT TWO YEARS TO BE
NOR OF AN EXECUTIVE?
AND THERE IS A QUESTION IN THERE
SOMEWHERE.
>> I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE YOU
CAN ANSWER WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE.
I THINK THE THINK ABOUT OBAMA IS
HE KNEW THAT HE MIGHT JUST HAVE
TWO YEARS, SO HE SAID, IF I'M
ONLY GOING TO HAVE TWO YEARS
WITH CONTROL OF CONGRESS, GET
HEALTH CARE, GET SOME OF THESE
OTHER THINGS, EVEN IF IT MEANS I
MIGHT NOT GETxD REELECTED.
>> Jon: DID HE GO AFTER THE
STRUCTURE OF WASHINGTON?
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT HAS NOT
BEEN THE CASE.
>> HE SURE TRIED, AND
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GREAT
RALLY LAST SATURDAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )ñr
>> Jon: CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
HOW ABOUT THAT AMERICA.
THAT'S SOME COUNTRY.
>> IT IS.
BUT...
>> Jon: I PANDERED.
YOU GAVE ME NOTHING.
>> IT'S THE GUY IN THE BACK
ROOM.
>> Jon: I KNOW.
>> THE BEST THING YOU SAID WAS
ABOUT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
WORKING TOGETHER.
BARACK OBAMA SAID THAT IN 2008.
IT HASN'T HAPPENED.
NOW HE'S GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO
TRY TO DEAL WITH REPUBLICANS IN
CONGRESS AND PERHAPS...
>> Jon: IN OUR LIVES WE DON'T
NECESSARILYÑi SELF-IDENTIFY AS
STRONGLY DEMOCRATIC OR
REPUBLICAN, WILL BE RAL,
CONSERVATIVE, PEOPLE HAVE TO PUT
IT ASIDE TO GET THINGS DONE.
YOU THINK IN WASHINGTON THEY
LOSE SIGHT OF THAT BECAUSE OF
HOW FOCUSED THEY ARE ON THE
HORSE RACE, ON THE STRATEGY, AND
IT'S VERY EASY TO LOSE SIGHT OF
THAT.
THE CURRENCY OF WASHINGTON IS
ABOUT POLITICAL POWER.
THE CURRENCY OF AMERICA IS ABOUT
RUNNING YOUR LIFE.
>> RIGHT, TOTALLY AGREE.
>> AND THE OTHER THING IS IN
WASHINGTON UNLIKE AMERICA, THE
WAY YOU RAISE MONEY IS CONFLICT.
YOU DON'T SEE THE REPUBLICANS
WRITING LETTERS TO THEIR DONORS.
NANCY PELOSI IS A REALLY NICE
LADY AND A PATRIOT BUT WE
DISAGREE.
IT'S NANCY PELOSI IS SAINTIAN.
-- SATAN.
>> Jon: AND THEN YOU GET
MONEY.
VERY INTERESTING.
A LOT OF THE FIRE BRANDS LAWS.
GRAYSON LOST.
I BELIEVE JOE WILSON MAY BE IN
DANGER OF LOSING, THE "YOU LIE"
GENTLEMAN AND THE GUY WHO CALLED
HIS OPPONENT THE TALIBAN.
BOTH I THINK TONIGHT GOING DOWN
TO DEFEAT.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
>> IT'S A NICE THING I THINK
WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS
LISTENING TO YOUR SPEECH LAST
SATURDAY.
>> OH, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT... NO, NO.
( APPLAUSE )
YOU ASK THE QUESTION.
>>
>> Jon: I ASK THE QUESTION,
AND YOU LIE TO MY FACE.
SO TOMORROW YOU WAKE UP YOU'RE,
A DEMOCRAT, HOW DO YOU LOOK
YOURSELVES IN THE MIRROR?
YOU PACK A LITTLE EXTRA ORANGE
IN YOUR SUITCASE, HEAD OUT TO
WORK AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO?
>> AND PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF
THE OTHER.
THE ONE THING DEMOCRATS HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IS WHEN THIS HAPPEN,
PUBLIC IN THE HOUSE WILL HAVE
THE POWER OF SUBPOENA.
AND THERE IS A RECORD OF AN
OPPOSITION PARTY GOING AFTER A
PRESIDENT IN POWER.
>> Jon: HELLO, LAWYERS' FEES.
WELL, THAT'S A BYE.
MICHAEL, ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOU.
