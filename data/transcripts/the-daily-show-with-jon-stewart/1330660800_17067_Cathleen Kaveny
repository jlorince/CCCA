>> I GUESS TONIGHT SHI IS
THE PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY
AND LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
NOTRE DAME.
ALSO FOR COMMON WHEEL
MAGAZINE.
HER FORTHCOMING BOOK IS
CALLED LAWS VIRTUES
FOSTERING AWE TON IMAND
SOLIDARITY, PLOOS WELCOME
CATHLEEN KAVENY.
(APPLAUSE)
WELCOME.
>> HI.
>> THAT IS A LOT OF DEGREES
YOU'RE HOLDING IT THERE,
PROFESSOR.
>> 23 GRADE.
>> THAT IS A LOT.
YOU STAYED IN THERE SO TALK
TO ME, YOU ARE PROFESSOR OF
LAW IN THEOLOGY.
THIS FITS IN PERFECTLY.
HOW DO RELIGIOUS
INSTITUTIONS NAVIGATE THE
DIFFICULTIES OF BEING A PART
OF A SECULAR SOCIETY.
HOW DO THEY SET UP THE
GUIDELINES.
>> WELL, THIS IS ACTUALLY A
NEW QUESTION FOR CATHOLICS
IN SOME WAYS.
BECAUSE CATHOLICS ARE USED
TO HAVING A MORALITY THAT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY
ACCEPTS.
WE USED TO CALL IT NATURAL
LAW IT WAS A COMMON MORALITY
ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE.
BUT NOW WE'RE IN A CONTEXT
WHERE IT'S VERY CLEAR, NOT
EVERYBODY ACCEPTS CATHOLIC
TEACHING ON CONTRACEPTION,
HOMOSEXUALITY, ON THE ONE
HAND OR EVEN THE DEATH
PENALTY ON THE OTHER HAND.
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO,
I THINK, AS A CHURCH, AS A
WHOLE IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO BE TRUE TO OUR OWN
COMMITMENTS ON THE ONE HAND,
BUT ALSO RESPECT OTHER
PEOPLE IN THE BROADER
SOCIETY, AND OTHER PEOPLE
WHO WORK IN CATHOLIC
INSTITUTIONS WHO AREN'T
CATHOLIC.
>> WHERE WOULD THESE
DECISIONS COME DOWN FROM FOR
THIS.
BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BREAK
ALONG CULTURAL LINES.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO STREAKLY.
THIS CONTRACEPTION ISSUE,
HOW WOULD THAT, SO THE
CATHOLIC HOSPITAL HERE, THE
HEALTH INSURANCE IS CHANGE,
WE HAVE TO COVER WOMEN'S
PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE,
CONTRACEPTION.
WHO DO THEY CALL, DO YOU
CALL, YOU KNOW, POPE --
>> IT IS NOT THE BACKBONE TO
THE POPE.
>> Jon: THERE IS NO RED
PHONE.
>> NO.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS
THE BIG PICTURE ISSUES ARE
SET BY THE POPE AND THE
COLLEGE OF BISHOPS.
YOU KNOW, ABOUT 5,000
BISHOPS IN THE WHOLE WORLD,
NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES.
AND THEY ISSUE TOGETHER KIND
OF THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS OR
THE BASIC DOCUMENTS.
SO VATICAN -- YOU MIGHT HAVE
HEARD OF VATICAN 2, WITH THE
CONFERENCE THAT TOOK PLACE
50 YEARS AGO.
>> Jon: GREAT SEQUEL.
>> VATICAN 3, WE'RE WAITING
FOR IT.
>> Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE IN
3-D, GOING TO BE AWESOME.
HOW QUICKLY REQUEST THEY
MUSTER UP THAT, BECAUSE FOR
JEWS IT TAKES ABOUT 4,000
YEARS.
TAKES US AWHILE TO GET A
CONSENSUS.
>> IT TAKES US ALMOST AS
LONG.
SO THE BIG DOCUMENTS ARE SET
BY THAT THEN THE POPE ISSUES
DOCUMENTS THAT STATE, YOU
KNOW, CATHOLIC TEACHING, YOU
KNOW, ON CERTAIN ISSUES LIKE
THE DOCUMENT THAT STATES
CATHOLIC TEACHING ON BIRTH
CONTROL, JOHN PAUL II ISSUED
AN-- THAT TALKED ABOUT
CATHOLIC TEACHING ON
ABORTION AND EUTHANASIA.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS
THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE THE BIG
PICTURE.
AND THEN YOU TURN TO
DIFFERENT BISHOPS
CONFERENCES, FOR WAYS OF
KIND OF OPERATIONALIZING IT
IN A PARTICULAR CONTEXT, A
PARTICULAR LOCATION.
SO THEN THE BISHOPS IN
AMERICA SAY OKAY, WHAT ARE
GOING TO BE OUR PRIORITIES.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO FOCUS
ON.
AND THEN THEY DECIDE THAT,
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ABOUT 450
BISHOPS.
AND THEY BASICALLY SAY THEY
GET TOGETHER IN A COUPLE OF
MEETINGS A YEAR AND SAY THIS
IS WHAT WE THINK WE NEED TO
WORK ON.
AND THEN THEY ISSUE
DOCUMENTS.
BUT THE KEY THING ABOUT THE
BISHOPS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER
IS THAT IT'S MORE LIKE LIKE,
YOU KNOW, A NEIGHBORHOOD
BLOCK THAN LIKE YOUR CONDO
BOARD.
>> Jon: IS THAT DIVISIVE AND
UGLY?
>> I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE
MEETINGS.
BAD SCENE.
>> SO EACH INDIVIDUAL BISHOP
STILL HAS, YOU KNOW, CONTROL
OVER HIS OWN DIOCESE.
AND SO THIS IS MORE, THEY'RE
WORKING TOGETHER BUT THEY
CAN'T BIND INDIVIDUAL
BISHOPS EXCEPT UNDER VERY
SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS
TO-- IT'S HARD NOT TO VIEW
IT AS FALLING TO A
PARTICULAR CULTURE WAR,
POLITICAL VIEWPOINT BECAUSE
YOU THINK ALL RIGHT, THEY
DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR
WOMEN'S CONTRACEPTION.
BUT THEY ALREADY PAY FOR
VIAGRA.
>> RIGHT.
>> IN SOME OF THE HEALTH
INSURANCES THAT THEY OFFER.
THERE ARE SURELY SINGLE MEN
THAT ARE USING IT FOR
NONPROCEED OPERATIONAL
ISSUES THAT WORK IN CATHOLIC
INSTITUTION Y HASN'T THAT
BEEN AN ISSUE.
>> I THINK MORALLY IT WOULD
BE AN ISSUE.
AND THE CONSISTENCY IS
ALWAYS AN ISSUE.
AND TRYING TO TREAT MEN AND
WOMEN EQUALLY, YOU KNOW, IS
A BIG ISSUE IN THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH.
AND MY GUESS IS THAT THEY
THINK THIS IS A BIGGER
PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AND THEY
THINK IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM
I THINK BECAUSE OF THE
DOCUMENT THAT SAID THAT IT'S
ALWAYS WRONG TO USE BIRTH
CONTROL.
>> BUT DON'T THEY --
>> FOR PURPOSES OF
PREVENTING CONCEPTION.
>> BUT DON'T THEY ALSO PAY,
YOU KNOW, THE ITEM IS THEY
WON'T PAY T IS AGAINST THEIR
CONSCIENCE TO PAY FOR
INSURANCE THAT MAY PAY FOR
IT BUT THEY ALREADY PAY
THEIR EMPLOYEES DIRECTLY.
ISN'T THAT LIKE HANDING THEM
A BOX OF CONDOMS?
BECAUSE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
HAVE, IF YOUR IDEA IS WE
DON'T WANT TO CONTRIBUTE
TO --
>> YEAH.
>> TO THIS EVIL, AREN'T THEY
ALREADY CONTRIBUTING CASH.
>> THERE IS-- THAT'S A
WONDERFUL QUESTION.
AND YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE A
MORAL THEE LODGEAN IF YOU
WANTED.
>> I WOULD LIKE THAT SO
MUCH.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
>> THERE'S A DOCTRINE --
>> HOW BIG A HAT DO I GET AS
A MORAL THEOLOGAN.
>> I LIKED THE ONE YOU WORE
MONDAY NIGHT.
>> Jon: OKAY, I WILL WEAR
THAT.
THE CATHOLIC TRADITION HAS
ALWAYS LIVED IN A IS VERY
MESSY WORLD AND SO IT
DEVELOPS A KIND OF SET OF
CATEGORIES TO THINK ABOUT
THIS.
AND THE CATEGORY, THE
FRAMEWORK IT'S CALLED
COOPERATION WITH EVIL.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
>> OH MY GOD.
>> SO THAT'S THEIR
EMPLOYEES.
>> NO, NO, NO.
THEY LOVE THEIR EMPLOYEES.
>> Jon: IF IT IS, YOU SPEAK
OF IT IN TERMS OF
INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSE AND
ALL THOSE THINGS BUT THE
LANGUAGE OF IT IS VERY A
PROCT LIP PARTICULAR AND
VERY MUCH ABOUT PERSECUTION
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND IN
NO WAY REFLECTIVE OF WHAT
SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE
THOUGHTFUL PROCESS THAN YOU
ARE TALKING ABOUT.
>> THIS STRAND IS ABOUT AS
DRY AS THE TAX CODE OF MORAL
THEOLOGY BECAUSE YOU
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN VARIOUS
DEGREES OF CONNECTION WITH
EVIL.
IN AMERICA WHAT IS
INTERESTING ABOUT THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN AMERICA
IS THAT IT HAS PICKED UP A
LOT OF PROTESTANT DISCOURSE
IN TALKING ABOUT HOW WE
RELATE.
AND THE PURITANS HAD THIS
PRACTICE DECISION CALLED THE
INJURY MYI HAD,-- JERAMIAD,
SO PART OF WHAT YOU ARE
SEEING IS CATHOLIC MORAL
RHETORIC TO A PROTESTANT
CONTEXT THAT IS STILL VERY
AFFECTED BY PROTESTANT.
>> Jon: PUT A LITTLE
JEWISH-- UNDERNEATH IT.
DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO
STICK AROUND.
CATHLEEN KAVENY, GREAT JO
