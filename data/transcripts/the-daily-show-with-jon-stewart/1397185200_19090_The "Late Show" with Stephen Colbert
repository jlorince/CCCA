[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]GOOD MORNING.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEWFILM "DRAFT DAY" JENNIFER GARNER
IS JOINING US. BUTBEFORE WE START AS YOU
CAN IMAGINE, IT'S BEEN A BIT OFA WILD DAY AROUND HERE.
YOU MAY REMEMBER A FEW YEARSBACK THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN ON
THIS PROGRAM BY THE NAME OFSTEPHEN COLBERT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HE WAS -- YEA HIGH, SKIN LIKE
PORCELAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]VERY TALENTED ACTOR, WRITER,
DANCER, IMPROVISATIONALCOMEDIAN.
WE WOULD OCCASIONALLY SEND HIMOUT INTO THE FIELD, USUALLY WITH
SOME TYPE OF FRUIT AND WEWOULD SEE WHERE THE DAY TOOK US.
>> THERE'S AN ALLEGATION THATTHE PRINCE HAD A GAY EXPERIENCE.
>> YOUR WORDS, NOT MINE, JON.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH, IFIT WAS SUBSTANTIATED.
[LAUGHTER]NOT GAY, JON, ARISTOCRATIC, IT'S
A DIFFERENT CULTURE THAN OURS.
>> Jon: WHAT IS DIFFERENTABOUT IT?
[LAUGHTER]>> YOU KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]MAINLY HOW GAY IT IS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: OKAY.
SO --[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY WE SPENT ALL DAYLOOKING UP OLD STUFF ON THE
INTERNET OF STEPHEN.
IT'S REALLY FUN.
I MEAN WORKING, WE WERE WORKING.
TRULY ONE OF GREAT PLEASURES OFDOING THIS WILL SHOW HAS BEEN
TRYING TO MAINTAIN PROFESSIONALCOMPOSURE WHILST MR. COLBERT IS
MAKING ME LAUGH UNCONTROLIBLY.
THE EXCITING NEWS TODAY IS I NOLONGER NEED A CABLE SUBSCRIPTION
FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHINGSTEPHEN COLBERT.
OUR GOOD FRIEND STEPHEN COLBERTWILL BE HEADING TO CBS TO TAKE
OVER THE LATE SHOW FROM, FOR ATLEAST ME, THE COMEDIAN
BROADCASTER WHO IS THE BESTTHERE EVER WAS, DAVID LETTERMAN.
I THINK THE BEST THERE EVER WAS.
AND I THINK -- HERE IS THEEXCITING THING FOR ME.
I THINK STEPHEN COLBERT IS UPFOR THE CHALLENGE.
WHILE WE WISH DAVE THE ABSOLUTEBEST FOR A WELL EARNED
RETIREMENT, THERE'S NO GREATERJOY THAN SEEING A GENUINELY GOOD
MAN WHO WORKS AS HARD AS HE CANEVERY DAY AND DESERVES ALL THE
SUCCESS IN THE WORLD ACTUALLYGET THAT SUCCESS.
FOR STEPHEN WE'RE JUST THRILLED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]IT WILL BE,
HERE IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARDTO BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN BROADWAY
AND LOOK UP AT THE ED SULLIVANTHEATER MARQUEE AND SEE
THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHENCOLBERT, ASSUMING THAT IS
WHERE THEY TAPE IT.THERE IS ALSO, YOU KNOW, A
THEATER ACROSS THE STREET FROMUS HERE WHICH I
BELIEVE IS CURRENTLY REFERREDTO AS THE HUSTLER CLUB.
BOTH VENUES PRETTY FAMILIAR WITHTHE PRESENCE OF ED SULLIVAN.
MY POINT IS THIS --[LAUGHTER]
GODSPEED TO BOTH MEN.
