WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOWMY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
KATIE COURIC IS GOING TO BEHERE.
VERY EXCITED.
KATIE COURIC, DISCUSSING HER NEWDOCUMENTARY "FED UP," IS GOING
TO BE JOINING US.
BUT, MY FRIENDS, WE ON THIS SHOWDISCUSS POLITICS AND WE HAVE
SOMETIMES BEEN KNOWN TOCRITICIZE, LAMPOON--
( LAUGHTER )TO TAKE-- TO TAKE FUN AND POKE
IT.
( LAUGHTER )WELL, TONIGHT, WE REMOVE OUR
JESTER'S CAP IN RESPECTFULSALUTE TO DEMOCRACY ON PARADE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOUTHE NEW YORK STATE SENATE.
>> THIS BILL WOULD DESIGNATEYOGURT AS THE OFFICIAL STATE
SNACK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  THAT, MY FRIENDS,
NEW YORK STATE SENATOR MICHAELRANZENHOFER.
AT THE BEHEST OF A LOCAL FOURTHGRADE CLASS ATTEMPTING TO BRING
FORTH INTO LAW AN OFFICIAL HONORFOR NEW YORK'S VAUNTED YOGURT
INDUSTRY, IT'S WHAT'S KNOWN INLEGISLATIVE CIRCLES AS GIMME.
A NO-BRAINER.
THE TYPE OF FEEL-GOOD,PRO-BUSINESS, AND PROBIOTIC--
>> WOULD THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR AFEW QUESTIONS?
>> Jon:  WAIT, SPONSORYIELD?
YIELD FOR QUESTIONS?
WHO DARETH RISE?
( LAUGHTER )SENATOR RIVERA, WHAT
QUIBBLE DOTH THOU PROFFER.
>> AS FAR AS A STATE SNACK WHATEXACTLY ARE WE DEFINING AS A
SNACK HERE?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  TOUCHE.
A PHILOSOPHICAL QUERY.
YOUR ANSWER, SENATORRANZENHOFER.
>> I THINK IT'SSELF-EXPLANATORY.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE BREAKFAST,LUNCH, AND DINNER, AND THEN YOU
HAVE SNACKS.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  I THINK WE'RE DONEHERE.
I BELIEVE THERE ARE NO FURTHERQUESTIONS.
PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE ON TO AVOTE.
>> DID YOU CONSIDER, SAY, THEPOTATO CHIP AS A POTENTIAL STATE
SNACK?
>> NO.
>> DID THE SPONSOR CONSIDERRAISINS AS THE POTENTIAL
OFFICIAL STATE SNACK?
>> NO.
>> DID THE SPONSOR CONSIDER,PERHAPS, PRETZELS AS THE
POTENTIAL STATE-- OFFICIAL STATESNACK?
>> NEVER.
>> Jon:  NEVER!
I NEVER DID AND I NEVER SHALL!
FOR THE PRETZEL IS ANABOMINATION.
TO TAKE PERFECTLY GOOD DOUGH, TOTWIST IT, TO BAKE IT WITHIN AN
INCH OF ITS LIFE AND THEN TOSALT IT AS THE ROMANS DID TO
CARTHAGE.
IT IS OUTRAGE.
IT IS AN OUTRAGE.
( LAUGHTER )I DON'T LIKE PRETZELS.
( LAUGHTER )SORRY, SENATOR RIVERA, YOU
WEREN'T FINISHED?
>> WHAT IF, FOR YOU MR.PRESIDENT, THE PRETZEL WAS
DIPPED IN YOGURT? WOULD THATTHEN BE CONSIDERED -- COULD WE
CONSIDER THAT? THAT WOULD BE TWOIN ONE, MR. PRESIDENT?
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  OH, MY GOD!
THIS GUY IS BATMAN.
( LAUGHTER )WHAT SAY YOU, SENATOR
HASSELHOFF?
>> YOGURT WOULD BE THE STATESNACK.
THE PRETZEL WOULD NOT.
>> Jon:  THE PRETZEL, IF SODIPPED, WOULD BE THE STATE SNACK
CONVEYANCE, OR DELIVERY METHOD,FOR WHICH DESIGNATION I REFER TO
THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SNACKTRANSPORTATION.
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS WAS MAYBETHE BEST 40 MINUTES ANY
LEGISLATIVE CHAMBER ANYWHERE INTHE COUNTRY HAS EVER SPENT.
BUT, OF COURSE, AS ALL GOODTHINGS MUST COME TO AN END, WE
DO HAVE TO MOVE TO A VOTE.
>> THROUGH YOU, THE SPONSORWOULD PLEASE YIELD.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU ( BLEEP )KIDDING ME?
ALL RIGHT, SENATOR, SENATORKRUEGER.
>> WOULD WE NEED TO REQUIRE THATTHE STATE SNACK OF NEW YORK BE
YOGURT THAT IS PRODUCED IN THESTATE OF NEW YORK.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  DEAR GOD, ANSWER
HER.
>> IS THERE A DEFINITION OF THEKIND OF YOGURT THAT WOULD BE OUR
STATE SNACK?
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEFOURTH GRADERS WANTED TO
DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN DIFFERENTTYPES OF YOGURT.
( LAUGHTER )I'M GOING TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU GUYS RIGHT HERE.
I'M SURE THE FOURTH GRADERSDIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DO THIS
PROJECT.
I'M SURE THEY WEREN'T EVENINTERESTED.
I'M SURE IT WAS AN ASSIGNMENT.
SOME SORT OF WEIRDINTERPRETATION OF THE COMMON
CORE.
I'M SURE THE KIDS ARE LIKE, "ITWAS MISS ROSSI'S IDEA!
I DON'T KNOW." AND, AS FOR YOU,
KRUEGER I'VE GOT NOPATIENCE FOR THIS NIT-PICKERY.
NOBODY, NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR ANYMORE OF YOUR PETTY COMPLAINTS
ABOUT THE YOGURT BILL.
>> ONE OF MY POSSIBLE CONCERNSWITH SUPPORTING YOGURT AS THE
NEW YORK STATE OFFICIAL SNACK ISTHE ISSUE OF LACTOSE
INTOLERANCE.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I YIELD THE FLOOR.
SENATOR HOOTENANNY, WHAT SAYYOU?
>> THERE IS SOY YOGURT, WHICHDOES NOT HAVE THE VERY PRODUCTS
WHICH YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT,AND THAT'S WHY, BACK TO YOUR
EARLIER QUESTION, IN TERMS OFDESIGNATING A SPECIFIC TYPE OF
YOGURT, YOGURT IS A VERY GENERICAND ALL-INCLUSIVE TYPE OF
PRODUCT.
>> Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP ).
THIS GUY IS LIKE THE KENJENNINGS OF YOGURT.
HE'S GOT AN INCREDIBLYENCYCLOPEDIC AND FLUID
ARGUMENTATIVE STYLE UNTIL IT ALLCAME CRASHING DOWN.
>> YOU HAVE THE STATE FLOWER.
WE HAVE THE STATE TREE, WHICH ISTHE SUGAR MAPLE.
AND LASTLY, LET ME TALK ABOUTTHE STATE MUFFIN.
THE STATE MUFFIN IS THE APPLEMUFFIN, WHICH WAS NAMED IN 1987.
AND, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WHENYOU'RE-- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE APPLE MUFFIN IT'S NOTTHE FACT THAT THE APPLE MUFFIN
IS BAKED IN SYRACUSE ORTHE APPLE MUFFIN IS BAKED IN NEW
YORK CITY.
( LAUGHING )IT'S THE FACT THAT, IT'S THE
FACT THAT WE HAVETHE APPLE MUFFIN.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  YEAH.
YEAH, THE APPLE MUFFIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S NICE.
YEAH, IT'S NICE.YEAH, THE APPLE-- THE APPLE
MUFFIN IS FUNNY TO YOU? THEAPPLE MUFFIN IS A JOKE? WHAT, IS
THE APPLE MUFFIN A (bleep) CLOWNTO YOU?
IS THAT IT? IS THE APPLE MUFFINHERE TO AMUSE YOU?
WHAT'S SO ( BLEEP ) FUNNY ABOUTTHE NEW YORK STATE APPLE MUFFIN?
SORRY. THAT WAS MY FAVORITEPART OF THE WHOLE DEBATE.
