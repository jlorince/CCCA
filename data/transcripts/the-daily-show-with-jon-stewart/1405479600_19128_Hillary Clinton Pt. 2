[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: SO, WE'RE BACK. WE'RE
TALKING WITH HILLARY CLINTON.WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS
WE FACE. SO WE TALKED ABOUT, YOUKNOW, WE HAVE THESE STRUCTURAL
PROBLEMS. >> RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU'VE SEEN IT WHEN YOUWERE IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS FIRST
LADY.
YOU'VE SEEN IT AS SENATOR IN THELEGISLATIVE BRANCH.
>> UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
>> Jon: YOU WERE IN THECABINET.
>> YEP.
>> Jon: HAS THE BUREAUCRACY OFGOVERNMENT BECOME UNMANAGEABLE
TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS NOLONGER ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY RAISE
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLETHAT IT IS TRYING TO DO SO?
>> WELL, JON, I THINK IT'S ACOMBINATION OF BOTH A CONGRESS
THAT IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONINGEFFECTIVELY
AND A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION
IN OUR EXECUTIVE BRANCH BECAUSEI THINK
IF PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE HERE, ITHINK HE WOULD SAY IT HAS NOT
KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES.
WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OFAGILITY AND FLEXIBILITY AND
TECHNOLOGY.
SO THE BUREAUCRACY MOVES SLOWLY.
THE CONGRESS IS GRIDLOCKED.
SO WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OURDEMOCRACY.
AND WHAT I SAW GOING TO 112COUNTRIES IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
THAT WE FUNCTION IN THE UNITEDSTATES, BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK TO
US.
OUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN THE BEACONFOR SO MANY YEARS, LIKE YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT BEFORE.
GUESS WHAT, PEOPLE WANT TO COMEHERE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'LL
BE SAFE, THEY'LL HAVE ANOPPORTUNITY.
WE HAVE TO MANAGE IT.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED COMPREHENSIVEIMMIGRATION REFORM, WHICH IS
SOMETHING THAT CONGRESS SHOULDPASS.
>> Jon: BUT IS OUR EXPECTATION,OUR EXPECTATION OF OUR PLACE IN
THE WORLD, YOU KNOW, TECHNOLOGYAS WE BECOME LESS AGILE,
TECHNOLOGY HAS DEMOCRATIZEDPOWER TO A LARGE EXTENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU SEE VERY SMALLGROUPS WHO ARE ABLE TO SOW A
GREAT DEAL OF DESTRUCTIVE FORCE,AND IS AMERICA, YOU KNOW, WE
ARE A LARGE IMPERIAL POWER.
AND THE IDEA THAT WE CANEXERCISE THAT POWER IN THE SAME
MANNER AS WE SEE IN, YOU KNOWWHAT, IS OUR FOREIGN POLICY
ANYMORE?
>> YEAH, YEAH. WELL, THAT'SREALLY WHY THIS BOOK IS
SOMETHING THAT I PUT MY HEARTAND SOUL INTO, BECAUSE WE
CAN'T PRACTICE DIPLOMACY AND
DEFINE OUR FOREIGN POLICY ASLEADERS TALKING TO LEADERS
ANYMORE.
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEWORLD WORKS.
EXACTLY AS YOU SAID.
PEOPLE ARE EMPOWERED FROM THEBOTTOM UP.
AND WHAT I FOUND WHEN I BECAMESECRETARY OF STATE IS THAT SO
MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, ANDESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY
HAD NO MEMORY OF THE UNITEDSTATES LIBERATING EUROPE AND
ASIA, BEATING THE NAZIS,FIGHTING THE, YOU KNOW,
COLD WAR AND WINNING.
THAT WAS JUST ANCIENT HISTORY.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE SACRIFICESTHAT WE HAD MADE AND THE VALUES
THAT MOTIVATED US TO DO IT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE HAVE NOT BEEN TELLING OURSTORY VERY WELL.
WE DO HAVE A GREAT STORY.
WE ARE NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS,BUT WE HAVE A GREAT STORY ABOUT
HUMAN FREEDOM, HUMAN RIGHTS,HUMAN OPPORTUNITY, AND LET'S GET
BACK TO TELLING IT TO OURSELVESFIRST AND FOREMOST AND BELIEVING
IT ABOUT OURSELVES AND THENTAKING THAT AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BESTANDING FOR.
>> Jon: CAN WE EXPECT OTHERCOUNTRIES TO VIEW US WITH SUCH
NUANCE WHEN WE SO CLEARLY DON'TVIEW THEM WITH NUANCE AND WITH
THAT TYPE OF UNDERSTANDING?
>> THAT'S A, THAT'S A REALLYGOOD QUESTION, BECAUSE...
>> Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WEHAVE.
[LAUGHTER]>> BECAUSE?
>> Jon: BECAUSE.
>> BECAUSE WE DID A MUCH BETTERJOB TELLING THE WORLD WHO WE
WERE BACK IN THE COLD WAR.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A SIMPLER JOB,TO BE FAIR.
WE HAD THE SOVIET UNION.
WE HAD THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAD A BIG INFORMATION EFFORT.
WE SENT, WE SENT TALENT, WE SENTALL KINDS OF POETS AND NOVELISTS
AND ROCK STARS.
I REMEMBER WHEN VACLAV HAVEL,THE GREAT DISSIDENT AND THE
FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE CZECHREPUBLIC TOLD ME THAT LOU REED
HAD BEEN HIS INSPIRATION.
AMERICAN CULTURE, AMERICANIDEAS PERMEATED THE WORLD.
WELL, FAST FORWARD.
THAT ENDED, AND WE KIND OFTHOUGHT, OKAY, FINE, END OF
HISTORY, DEMOCRACY WON.
YOU KNOW THAT STORY.
AND IN FACT, WE WITHDREW FROMTHE INFORMATION ARENA.
AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENEDINITIALLY WITH UKRAINE.
RUSSIAN MEDIA WAS MUCH MOREEFFECTIVE IN SORT OF TELLING A
STORY: IT WASN'T TRUE, BUT THEYKEPT REPEATING IT OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO GET BACKTO A CONSENSUS IN OUR OWN
COUNTRY ABOUT WHO WE ARE ANDWHAT WE STAND FOR, AND THEN
GET OUT THERE AND, YOU KNOW,TELL THAT STORY.
>> Jon: "HARD CHOICES." IT'S ONTHE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL TALKA LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE WEB.
SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
