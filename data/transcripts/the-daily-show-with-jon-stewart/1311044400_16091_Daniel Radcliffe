>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT STARRING IN
HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS
WITHOUT REALLY TRYING.
YOU MAY KNOW HIM FROM HARRY
POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
PART 2.
>> CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?
>> EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH WILL
MULTIPLY.
>> Jon: COME ON.
THAT LOOKS COOL.
PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL
RADCLIFFE.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
HAVING ME ON.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT SPOILERS.
I DON'T WANT... I'VE NOT HAD A
CHANCE.
DOES HE GET HIS RING BACK?
>> YES.
HE'S THE CENTRAL CHARACTER IN
THIS FILM.
>> Jon: WHAT AN EXCITING TIME.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?
IS IT EXCITEMENT OVER HAVING
THIS DONE?
IS IT MELANCHOLY, BITTER-SWEET?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S WEIRD.
WHEN WE WERE AT THE LONDON
PREMIERE I WAS GETTING VERY
EMOTIONAL.
I WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, IT'S
BEEN A YEAR SINCE WE STOPPED
FILMING.
I GUESS I'M JUST KIND OF
FOCUSED ON THE SHOW AT THE
MOMENT AS WELL AS DOING IT
EIGHT TIMES A WEEK.
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN....
>> Jon: ARE YOU DOING THE SHOW
TONIGHT?
>> NO, NO, NO.
MONDAY IS OUR NIGHT OFF.
>> Jon: YOU GET ONE NIGHT OFF
ON EIGHT SHOWS A WEEK?
WELL, THAT IS THE LAZYIEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY
LIFE.
TRY DOING FOUR 2-MINUTE ONES.
>> IT'S KIND OF SAD AND WE'VE
ALL HAD OUR GRIEVING PERIOD.
NOW IT'S VERY EXCITING BECAUSE
LOADS OF PEOPLE GTS.
>> Jon: THEY'RE GOING CRAZY
FOR IT.
WHEN THEY COME AT YOU WITH
THAT EXCITE MANY, IS IT HARD
AS SOMEONE WHO IS A A PART OF
IT FOR TEN YEARS, DO YOU GET
JADED?
DOES PEOPLE'S ENTHUSIASM, DO
YOU GO LIKE THAT'S NICE.
>> NOT AT ALL.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, IT'S MAGIC.
>> NOT AT ALL.
THAT'S WHAT'S KIND OF COOL.
THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE
SERIES IS THE FACT WE HAVEN'T
GOT JADED.
WE WERE EXCITED TO GO TO WORK.
FROM THE SIMPLE FACT OF ALL
LOVING OUR JOBS AND HAVING
DIFFERENT DIRECTORS COMING IN
AND KEEPING THINGS FRESH AND
WORKING WITH THESE ACTORS.
IT'S HARD TO GET JADED WHEN
YOU'RE A 14-YEAR-OLD.
>> Jon: THAT IS PART OF IT
BECAUSE AS A 14-YEAR-OLD BEING
JADED IS IN MANY WAYS YOUR
JOB.
IT IS LIKE, OH, GARY IS
COMING.
OH, WOW.
YOU'RE 14, YOU KNOW.
>> I KNOW BUT I DON'T THINK
I'VE BEEN VERY GOOD AT THAT.
THERE'S THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT
PEOPLE MY AGE.
I THINK WHAT'S LOVELY ABOUT
THIS IS IT DOES KNOTS APPLY TO
THEM IN THE SLIGHTEST.
I'M ALWAYS AMAZED WHEN I MEET
A PERSON MY OWN AGE WHO IS
ENTHUSIASTIC.
I LATCH ON THEM.
COOL.
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THIS
RIDICULOUS PRETENDING THAT YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT STUFF.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
IT REMINDS ME OF STAR WARS.
I'M A 48-YEAR-OLD MAN.
AT A CERTAIN POINT GOING TO
THE STAR WARS CONVENTIONS, YOU
KNOW, BUT AS LONG AS MY SON
WILL DRESS UP LIKE OBI-WAN AND
PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF COVER FOR
ME, I DON'T MIND.
I'M NOT JADED ABOUT IT AT ALL.
I FIND THESE MOVIES TO BE
WONDERFUL MORALITY TALES WITH
GREAT CHARACTERS.
I ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF THEM.
>> THEY'RE A HUGE AMOUNT OF
FUN.
IT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY.
AMY, SHE LIVES IN MY BUILDING.
AND THE OTHER DAY I'VE BEEN
SAYING IT FOR WEEKS.
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER.
I HAD TO LEAN OVER AND SAID
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I'M A
MASSIVE FAN OF THE MIGHTY-B
WHICH IS A CARTOON.
ONLY ONE PERSON HERE KNOWS IT.
>> Jon: I KNOW IT.
>> I'M SCARED TO ADMIT THAT
THAT'S PERHAPS NOT THE ONE
THING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED ME
TO PICK OUT OF HER CATALOGUE
OF WORK.
I SPENT THREE HOURS TODAY
WATCHING CARTOONS.
>> Jon: I LIKE YOUR JOB.
>> THIS GIRL I REMEMBER ASKING
AT THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY,
SHE SAID HOW DID YOU PREPARE
FOR THIS SHOW?
SHE WANTED ME TO SAY I SIT IN
A STABLE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
I WAS LIKE WELL I WATCHED
CARTOONS.
KIND OF GO TO WORK AND DO IT.
>> Jon: I CAN TELL MY CHILDREN
ARE GOING TO BE ACTORS.
>> THAT'S ALL THE PREP YOU
REALLY NEED.
>> Jon: I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.
HERE ARE THE REAL WORLD
IMPLICATIONS OF HARRY POTTER.
ACROSS FROM OUR STUDIO.
WE'RE HERE ON THE 11th AVENUE
AND 52nd STREET STUDIOS WHICH
IS NEW YORK'S FAMED CRACK CORE
DISTRICT.
THERE IS A TOURNAMENT JUST
THREE DAYS AGO AND IT'S A
QUITTAGE TOURNAMENT.
REAL PEOPLE PLAYING REAL
QUITTAGE.
WE ASKED THEM TO SUBMIT SOME
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.
I WANT YOU TO SEE IT AND THEN
OBVIOUSLY ANSWER SOME.
LOOK AT THAT ONE.
>>
>> DO YOU FEEL ANY GUILT AT
ALL FROM OUR ONGOING
VIRGINITY?
DO YOU KNOW ANY ANTI-WEDGEY
SPELLS.
>> DAN, WHAT WAS UP WITH THE
FIRST HALF OF THE 7th MOVIE.
IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE BOOK
BUT NOT THE OTHER MOVIES.
>> CAN YOU TELL MY MOM TO PICK
ME UP AT 5:00.
>> DID YOU EVER DO IT.
WHAT IS "DO IT"?
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> LET ME THINK.
YES, I FEEL VERY GUILTY.
YOUR MOM HAS PROBABLY LEFT YOU
THERE BY NOW.
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE
OTHER ONES ARE BUT THAT POOR
KID, THEY WERE LIKE TACKLING
HIM.
>> Jon: HE'S TEN.
>> HE'S THE SNITCH.
I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO ME THAT
SOMEBODY RUNS AROUND AS A
SNITCH AND HE'S POUNCED ON.
>> Jon: THE KID IN YELLOW IS
TALKING AND THERE'S A GUY
BEHIND HIM WIELDING THE BROOM
LIKE A CLUB.
>> I DIDN'T SEE THAT.
>> Jon: LIKE CAPONE IN THE
UNTOUCHABLES.
LIKE "THIS BROOM GIVES ME
ENTHUSIASM."
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY GONE....
>> JON.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, WHAT DO
YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF I
DID THIS?
IT WOULD BE CHAOS.
I FIND THE REAL....
>> Jon: IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE
MADNESS.
>> IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK I WOULD
BE REALLY GOOD.
>> Jon: YOU'D BE, IN FACT, THE
CHOSEN ONE.
>> NICE.
>> Jon: HARRY POTTER AND THE
DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2.
>> YOU CAN'T AVOID IT.
>> Jon: YOU SHOULD GO SEE IT
IN THE THEATERS RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE IT HASN'T EARNED ITS
SECOND
