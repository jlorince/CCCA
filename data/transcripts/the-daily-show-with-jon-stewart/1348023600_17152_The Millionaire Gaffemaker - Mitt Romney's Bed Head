(LAUGHTER) NEEDLESS TO SAY, MITT ROMNEY HAD TO ADDRESS THIS SITUATION MID-REBOOT.
>> GOOD EVENING.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A VIDEO THAT'S BEEN ON THE INTERNET FOR A FEW WEEKS THAT HAS ATTRACTED SOME ATTENTION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT PRETTY MUCH DESCRIBES EVERY VIDEO ON THE INTERNET.
(LAUGHTER) ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT GANGNAM STYLE?
PANDA SNEEZING?
OH, RIGHT, THE VIDEO OF YOU DISRESPECTING 47% OF AMERICANS.
THAT'S WHY YOU JUST CASUALLY INTERRUPTED A BIG FUND-RAISER AT 10:30 AT NIGHT WITH THE MITT ROMNEY VERSION OF BED HEAD.
>> THIS IS REALLY A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POLITICAL PROCESS OF WINNING THE ELECTION AND, OF COURSE, I WANT TO HELP ALL
AMERICANS, ALL AMERICANS, HAVE A BRIGHT AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE.
>> Jon: SURE, YEAH, NO, WOW.
HIS WORDS SAY "NO BIG DEAL, I WANT TO HELP ALL AMERICANS." BUT HIS EYES AND BODY LANGUAGE SAY "HOLY (BLEEP), WE'RE ALL
GONNA DIE!" (LAUGHTER) LET ME GIVE YOU A BETTER EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE MESSAGE MITT ROMNEY
IS SENDING VERBALLY AND THE MESSAGE HE'S SENDING VISUALLY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I TAKE YOU TO A CRUISE SHIP SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC.
(LAUGHTER) HEY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S ME, YOUR CAPTAIN.
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK OF ICE ON THE STAR BOARD SIDE OF THE SHIP.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S ATTRACTED SOME ATTENTION.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYWAY, I-- I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REASSURE EVERYBODY WE HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL.
OBVIOUSLY WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO REACHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN WITH EVERYBODY NOT IN A WATERY GRAVE.
(LAUGHTER) THIS WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER IF I WAS LATINO.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
