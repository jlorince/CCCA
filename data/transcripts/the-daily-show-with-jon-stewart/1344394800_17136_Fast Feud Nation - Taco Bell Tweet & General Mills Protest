(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOT EASY TO FIND THAT TYPE OF FOREIGN TAKE A THANKLESS FAST FOOD JOB.
>> AN EMPLOYEE AT A LOCAL TACO BELL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A PICTURE HE POSTED ON TWITTER.
>> Jon: PLEASE DON'T BE A PICTURE OF SOMEONE PEEING ON NACHOS.
PLEASE DON'T BE A PICTURE OF SOMEONE PEEING ON NACHOS.
>> THAT PICTURE APPEARS TO BE AN EMPLOYEE URINATING IN A NACHO BELL GRANDE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: NO!
NOT A NACHO BELL GRANDE!
(LAUGHTER) UNLESS... IS THAT WHAT MAKES THEM GRANDE?
(LAUGHTER) I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE.
OH!
(AUDIENCE REACTS) ACTUALLY, THAT'S A FAKE, UNLESS THIS PERSON HAS LEARNED TO PEE
OUT OF HIS KNEE.
(LAUGHTER) AND, BY THE WAY, QUICK EDITORIAL OTE: REPORTING THIS STORY PAINSN ME DEEPLY.
NOT ONLY BECAUSE TACO BELL IS A MAJOR SPONSOR OF THIS PROGRAM BUT BECAUSE NACHO BELL GRANDE
ARE SO DELICIOUS.
(LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH SOCIAL MEDIA.
IT'S EASY TO FORGET THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE WHAT YOU POST.
NOT TO MENTION YOUR IDENTITY.
>> THE FORT WAYNE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CONFIRMED THAT EMPLOYEE IS CAMERON JANKOWSKI.
I'M TOLD HE HAS SINCE BEEN SUSPENDED.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER) STPHAOUPB WOW.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I DIDN'T KNOW WHO DID THIS, BUT THAT'S
THE KID I WOULD GUESS DID THIS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT PICTURE IS BASICALLY JUST HIM SAYING "YEAH, I PEED IN YOUR NACHOS.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M TAKING YOUR DAUGHTER OUT FOR A
NIGHT OF BONG HITS AND STREET RACING.
DON'T WORRY, POPS, I BROUGHT CONDOMS.
HERE, HAVE SOME (BLEEP)ING NACHOS." BY THE WAY, THE KID DIDN'T PEE
IN THE NACHOS, IT WAS JUST MOUNTAIN DUE AND HE WAS PRANKING HIS FRIENDS LEADING TO THIS NEW
SHOW "JANKIN' IT!" IRONICALLY ALSO SPONSORED BY TACO BELL.
EXCEPT FOR YOU, YOU'RE IMMORTAL,
EAT SIX TIMES A DAY!
SO IT SEEMS THE SOCIAL MEDIA/PREPARED FOODS HYBRID MEDIA EVENT IS BECOMING AN
ENTIRE GENRE OF A THING.
MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE HAS TO BE THIS ONE FROM MINNESOTA.
THIS GAY MARRIAGE OPPONENT TAPED HIS PROTEST OF THE GAY MARRIAGE SUPPORTING COMPANY THAT MAKES CHEERIOS.
>> THIS IS REALLY THE TREAT, NOW WITH THE HOMOSEXUALS AND THIS IS
OUR PROTEST OF GENERAL MILLS,
THEY'RE ADVOCATING SAME-SEX MARRIAGES.
(LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW THE BEST WAY TO PUT THAT FIRE OUT.
