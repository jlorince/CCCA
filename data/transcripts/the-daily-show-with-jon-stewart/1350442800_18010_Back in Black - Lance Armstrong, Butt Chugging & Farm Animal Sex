FACTORY ON THE OUTSIDE.
I WANT THIS TO BE OVER.
WITH ALL THE FOCUS ON THE
CAMPAIGN WE MISS INTERESTING
STORIES.
>> THE UNITED STATES ANTI-DOPING
AGENCY HAS RELEASED WHAT IT
CALLS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT
SEVEN TIME TOUR DE FRANCE WINNER
LANCE ARMSTRONG DOPED THROUGHOUT
HIS PROFESSIONAL CYCLING CAREER.
1,000 PAGES OF EVIDENCE AND
SWORN STATEMENTS BY 26 PEOPLE
INCLUDING 11 OF HIS FORMER
TEAMMATES.
THE USADA CALLED IT THE MOST SEW
FIST DATED AND PROACIALIZED
DOPING -- PROFESSIONALIZED
DOPING PROGRAM THE SPORT HAS
EVER SEEN.
>> Jon: TAKE THAT OTHER DOPING
PROGRAMS.
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!
MY GOD SUDDENLY I'M MUSSOLINI.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, ARMSTRONG FOR YEARS
HAS DENIED THE ALLEGES.
HAS HONESTY FALLEN THROUGH THE
CRACKS IN AMERICA?
LEWIS BLACK IS HERE WITH MORE
"BACK IN BLACK."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH
LANCE ARMSTRONG?
EVERYBODY WHO HAS EVER KNOWN HIM
SAYS HE WAS DOPING.
EVERYBODY WHO EVER RODE WITH
HIM, EVERYBODY WHO EVER SLEPT
WITH HIM, EVERYBODY WHO JAMMED A
NEEDLE IN HIS TANK.
THEY ALL SAY HE WAS DOPING.
BUT NOT LANCE.
>> AFTER A DECADE OF FIGHTING
WITH THE UNITED STATES
ANTI-DOPING AGENCY PROFESSIONAL
CYCLIST LANCE ARMSTRONG HAS
GIVEN UP.
>> HE INSISTS HE IS INNOCENT BUT
SAYS HE'S TIRED OF FIGHTING.
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME AND
ENERGY AND SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF
YOU.
>> THAT SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF
YOU.
YOU WIN A 2,000 MILE BIKE RACE
SEVEN YEARS IN A ROW AND GOING
TO COURT ONCE A MONTH IS TOO
MUCH WORK?
BUT I SUPPOSE THIS DOES EXPLAIN
HIS NEW DENY STRONG BRACELET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LOOK, I DON'T CARE THAT LANCE
ARMSTRONG WAS DOPING I CARE HE
WON'T ADMIT IT.
>> THE CHARACTERISTICS ARE
NOTHING SHORT AFTER SUNDAY TING.
>> POSSIBLY THE BEST ENDURANCE
ATHLETE IN THE WORLD.
>> HIS HEART CAN BEAT TWICE THAT
OF A NORMAL PERSON.
>> GETS ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT
OF OXYGEN OUT OF EVERY BREATH
THAN A HEALTHY 20-YEAR-OLD
WOULD.
HIS MUSCLES CAN GO HARDER AND
LONGER WITHOUT MAJOR FATIGUE.
>> HE HAD CANCER IN HIS LUNGS,
BRAIN, TESTICLES, HE WENT
INFLUENCE CHEMO AND LOST ONE OF
HIS BALLS FOR CHRIST SAKE AND HE
IS GETTING DOUBLE THE OXYGEN OUT
OF EVER BREATH.
THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T BE:  WAS
HE DOPING?
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE:  WHY
AREN'T ALL OF US DOPE SOMETHING
IN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I GET WINDED LIGHTING A
CIGARETTE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THINK OF THE KIDS.
I MEAN, IF A HERO LIKE LANCE
ARMSTRONG WON'T TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THERE'S
NO TELLING WHAT THEY MIGHT DO IF
THEY THINK THEY CAN JUST DENY
IT.
>> I SWEAR TO EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF YOU THAT EVERY ALLEGATION OF
GROSS AND IMMORAL ACTIVITY OF
CHUGGING OF ALCOHOL NEVER TOOK
PLACE AT THE PI KAPPA ALPHA
HOUSE.
>> FIRST THINGS FIRST.
HATS OFF TO THE BROTHERS IN THE
BACKGROUND FOR SOMEHOW KEEPING A
STRAIGHT FACE WHILE ORVILLE RED
ENBALKER LAWYER SAYS BUTT
CHUGGING.
>> AN ACTIVITY CALLED BUTT
CHUGGING THAT IS THE FIRST TIME
HE HAS EVER HEARD OF THE TWO
WORDS BUTT CHUGGING, BUTT
CHUGGING, WE ASKED SATURDAY
ANDER FEFS BUTT CHUGGING AND HIS
COMMENT WAS, WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?
IT'S WHERE YOU CHUG WITH YOUR
BUTT.
DON'T THEY TEACH ENGLISH TELL
UNIVERSITY OF -- ENGLISH AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE?
WHAT IS SO BAD AT BUTT CHUGGING
ANYWAYS.
YOU TELL ME I CAN DRINK AND
SMOKE AT THE SAME TIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT COULD BE WORSE THAN THIS?
I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB
HERE AND SAY NOTHING COULD BE
WORSE THAN THIS.
>> CARLOS ARE MEARS WAS ARRESTED
ON MONDAY IN A WARRANT FOR
CRIEWLT AT THIS TO ANIMALS.
HE IS ACCUSED OF PERFORMING SEX
ACTS WITH A 22 MONTH OLD DONKEY
NAMED DOODLE.
OKAY, I GUESS THAT WAS WORSE.
IN HIS DEFENSE, THAT DOODLE IS
ONE SWEET PIECE OF ASS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO THIS GUY ACTUALLY GOT CAUGHT
IN THE ACT.
BUT YOU KNOW AMERICANS, I'M SURE
HE WILL FIND SOME WAY TO DENY
IT.
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LOT OF
DIFFERENT FARMS AND BUILT A LOT
OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH
OTHER ANIMALS.
>> BUT I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL
RELATIONS WITH THAT DONKEY
DOODLE.
>> I MAY LOVE MY ANIMALS IN
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THAT DOES NOT
MEAN I DO NOT LOVE MY ANIMALS.
>> WAIT A MINUTE, YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO DENY THIS, ARE YOU?
>> PONIES AND DONKEYS --
>> HALLELUJAH, WE FOUND THE ONE
HONEST MAN IN AMERICA.
AND HE'S A DONKEY (bleep).
JON?
>> Jon: THANK YOU LEWIS.
LEWIS BLACK.
BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS,
LEWIS BLACK, SOLD OUT SHOWS ON
BROADWAY KICKING CRAZY ASS.
LEWIS CONGRATULATIONS ON T
