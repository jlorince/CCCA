TELL ME YOU'D RATHER BE
PRESIDENT THAN LOOK AT THAT.
YOU'D BE LYING.
RON PAUL CAME IN THIRD.
HE SEEMS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT
HIS BRONZE MEDAL SHOWING AND IS
MUCH HAPPIER THEY LET HIM SAY
STUFF LIKE THIS ON TELEVISION.
>> BEWARE THE MILITARY
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.
TIME TO GET OUT OF AFGHANISTAN.
I'M WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN WE
CAN SAY WE'RE ALL AUSTRIANS NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: DID AN ENTIRE AUDIENCE
AT AN IOWA HILTON JUST CHEER A
REFERENCE TO AN AUSTRIAN
ECONOMIST?
WE HAD TO LOOK UP WHATEVER THE
HELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
THAT'S AWESOME.
THIS CROWD, THEY JUST KNOW
EVERYTHING.
IT'S LIKE BEING AT A JIMMY
BUFFETT SHOW WHERE [BLEEPED] IS
GOING ON AND YOU'RE LIKE, WHY IS
EVERYBODY WEARING A PARROT ON
YOUR HEAD.
PEOPLE ARE HOLDING UP LIGHTERS,
PLAY "ABOLISH THE FED."
NEWT GINGRICH CAME IN FOURTH.
THREE WEEKS AGO HE WAS IN THE
LEAD UNTIL AN INTENSE SERIES OF
NEGATIVE ADS FROM THE ROMNEY
SUPER PAC PUMMELED HIM, BUT I'M
SURE HE WAS GRACIOUS ABOUT IT.
>> I WANT THE THANK EVERYBODY
WHO WORKED ALL FALL,
PARTICULARLY DURING THE
AVALANCHE OF NEGATIVE ADS, ALL
THROUGH BEING DROWNED IN TELLING
DIFFICULT, THE LATEST 30-SECOND
DISTORTION.
THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET
AMERICA BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
THEY WEREN'T MILLIONAIRES.
THEY WEREN'T FROM WALL STREET.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SUPER PAC.
THE MASSACHUSETTS MODERATE.
I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TELL
THE TRUTH.
ON TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THAT WASN'T A
CONCESSION SPEECH.
THAT WAS LIKE A THINLY VEILED,
PASSIVE AGRESSIVE SPEECH THAT A
INDIVIDUAL MAKES RIGHT BEFORE
THEY SLINK AWAY TO A
SKULL-SHAPED CAVE IN A VOLCANO
AND REEMERGE IN FIVE YEARS AS
SUPERVILLAIN VONN GINGRICH, THE
DARK LORD OF CHAOS WHOM IS
LAUGHING NOW, ROMNEY?
GENETICALLY SUPERCHARGED NEWT.
OF COURSE, ROMNEY COULD AFFORD
TO BE GRACIOUS.
WELL, HE CAN AFFORD PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING.
HOW EXPENSIVE CAN GRACIOUS BE?
BUT I IMAGINE HIS EIGHT-VOTE
VICTORY VALIDATES HIS STRATEGY
TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WILL GIVE
HIM AN EIGHT-VOTE VICTORY.
THE.
I LOVE OUR FEESMEDZ I LOVE OUR
CONSTITUTION.
I LOVE OUR LAND.
I LOVE OUR PEOPLE.
I LOVE THE HYMNS OF AMERICA.
AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL, OH
BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES,
FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN.
AND ONE MORE VERSE LET ME JUST
QUOTE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WOW, I'VE NEVER HEARD
AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL SOUND LIKE
SOMETHING YOU WERE FORCED TO
MEMORIZE AT EXETER.
EVEN IN VICTORY MITT ROMNEY'S
ORDINARY GUY PERSONA FEELS LIKE
IT CAME FROM A COMMITTED PERSONA
ORDINARY GUY KIT HE GOT FROM
HAMAKER SCHLEMMER FOR $14
MILLION.
MR. SANTORUM, THE SURPRISE
COFIRST PLACE FINISHER, SHOW
ROMNEY HOW IT'S DONE.
>> I WEAVE FOUNDATIONALLY THAT
THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE IN THIS RACE
IS FREEDOM.
MY GANN FARE TAUGHT ME BASIC
THINGS THAT MY DAD TAUGHT ME.
WORK HARD.
WORK HARD AND WORK HARD.
HE LEFT TO THE COAL FIELDS OF
SOUTHWEST PENNSYLVANIA.
HE CONTINUED TO WORK IN THOSE
MINDS UNTIL HE WAS 72 YEARS OLD.
DIGGING COAL.
THOSE HANDS DUG FREEDOM FOR ME.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HEY, ROMNEY, FOLLOW
THAT, [BLEEPED] FACE THAT.
IS THE STUFF.
OH, MY GOD, I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING FOR MITT ROMNEY, RICK
SANTORUM IS THE ACTUAL GUY
ROMNEY IS PRETENDING TO BE.
KUDOS TO SANTORUM.
HE WORKED HARD.
WE'VE HAD GOOD FUN HERE AT THE
SHOW WITH HIS LAST NAME AND ITS
PLACE IN GOOGLE HISTORY, BUT NO
MORE.
WE'RE NOT DOING IT ANYMORE.
IN HONOR OF THE WELL-FOUGHT IOWA
CAUCUS, I'M NOW GOING TO SHRED
THE HOURS AND HOURS OF
HIGH-QUALITY, EMMY ELIGIBLE ASS
JUICE JOKES THAT WE HAD PREPARED
FOR HIM.
HOLD ON.
LET ME JUST... NEVER GOING TO DO
THEM AGAIN NO MATTER HOW
TEMPTING IT MAY BE TO USE SOME
OF THEM.
>> IF YOU SCROLL DOWN, YOU CAN
SEE ALL OF THE COLORS OF THE
COUNTIES, THE BROWN THERE IS
RICK SANTORUM.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE.
>> Jon: DOG WITH SUNGLASSES.
DOG WITH SUNGLASSES.
DOG WITH SUNGLASSES.
FOR US THE BIT HAS RUB ITS
COURSE.
I VOW TO ONLY RIDICULE RICK
SANTORUM FOR HIS ABSURD AND
SOMETIMES VILE
