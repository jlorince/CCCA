BOOM!
BRICKS AND MORTGAGE AND SLAM.
ANYWAY, TO THE MAIN EVENT.
>> THE FIRST LADY AND THOSE NEW BANGS
>> Jon: YES.
IT'S A NEW HAIRCUT.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF SOMETHING FUN AND FLIRTY AT AGE APPROPRIATE.
SHE DOES IT.
SHE DOES IT.
I'M NOT DIMINISHING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HAIR.
THE POINT IS THIS.
FIRST HUSBAND BARACK OBAMA HAD HIS PUBLIC OATH ADMINISTERED TODAY.
REMEMBER WHEN THE TWO FAMOUSLY FUMBLED
>> I WILL EXECUTE THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT TO THE UNITED STATES FAITHFULLY
>> THAT I WILL EXECUTE THE OFFICE...
>> FAITHFULLY, THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
>> THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FAITH FLI SNIEM COURTEOUS, KIND AND FORGIVING.
THE PRESIDENT WAS NERVOUS THEN.
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
LET'S WATCH THEM DO IT AGAIN THIS TIME.
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING, IMAGINE YOU'RE MITT ROMNEY
>> THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
>> THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
>> AND WILL TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY.
YOU KNOW, ROMNEY IS WATCHING.
I GUARANTEE YOU IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES A DEVOUT MORMON HAS EVER USED THE FRAIZ, OH,
[BLEEP].
OF COURSE MR. ROMNEY WAS NOT IN ATTENDANCE.
THERE WERE STARS APLENTY.
WHO BETTER TO SPOT THEM GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS.
>> LOOK AT THAT CROWD GATHERING NOW.
MORGAN FREEMAN, I THINK.
RIGHT THERE ON THE CAPITAL STEPS.
BILL RUSSELL.
I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU, DAVID REMNICK.
>> Jon: NOW.
WHEN GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS, IN HIS DEFENSE, ALL TALL PEOPLE LOOK ALIKE TO HIM.
I SEE GRAY CHIN.
I DON'T KNOW.
STILL FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING, STEPHANAPOLOUS DID A VERY GOOD JOB.
RIGHT HERE OF COURSE YOU HAVE VENUS AND SERENA WILLIAMS COMING IN.
OVER THERE IS DANNY GLOVER.
, OWE THE DAZZLING MISS HALLY BRIE LOOKING FINE AND GENERAL COLIN POWELL AND HIS GIRLFRIEND
MOTOWN GREAT DIANA ROSS AND HERE'S A TREAT NBA HALL OF FAMER BILL RUSSELL.
THE CROWD LOVES 'EM.
AND THEN, IT WAS TIME FOR THE MAIN EVENT.
THE PRESIDENT'S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
JUST AS FEARED THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AS A LIBERAL.
>> WE WILL RESPOND TO THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
OUR JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL OUR GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE TREATED LIKE ANYONE
ELSE UNDER THE LAW.
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND SOCIAL SECURITY.
THEY DO NOT MAKE US A NATION OF TAKERS.
THEY FREE US TO TAKE THE RISKS THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT
>> Jon: ONE LAST THING I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR.
MY HEALTH CARE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO KILL YOUR WHITE GRANDPARENTS.
KILL 'EM DEAD.
