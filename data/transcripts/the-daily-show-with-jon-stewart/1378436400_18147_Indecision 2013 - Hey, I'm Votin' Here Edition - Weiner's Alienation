FOR MORE OF ANTHONY WEINER'S
ALIENATION OF VOTERS WE'RE
JOINED BY JESSICA WILLIAMS
IN HARLEM.
ANY SIGN OF ANTHONY WEINER
CAMPAIGNING UP THERE?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> HE WAS JUST HERE, JON.
HE BLEW THROUGH LIKE AN
[BLEEP] TORNADO.
AND I CAN'T QUITE DESCRIBE
WHAT I JUST SAW SO I TOOK A
PICTURE ON MY PHONE.
(LAUGHTER)
JON, I GUESS HE'S TRYING TO
APPEAL TO THE BLACK VOTE BUT
WE HAVEN'T DRESSED LIKE THAT
SINCE, UM, NEVER.
(LAUGHTER)
WE ARE NEVER DRESSED LIKE
THAT IN THE HISTORY OF TIME.
UNLESS WE'RE THE HARLEM
GLOBETROTTERS AND WE'RE
VISITING SCOOBY DOO IN A
VERY SPECIAL EPISODE.
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THAT THING NEXT TO HIM IS.
BUT I HAVE A THEORY THAT
IT'S SOME SORT OF SOUND
BRIEFCASE.
>> Jon: GOOD TO KNOW.
I HAVE SEEN THOSE THAT'S A
BOOM BOX.
>> THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
>> Jon: WELL, IT'S A LITTLE
BIT.
>> JON, JON.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY, AASIF
MANDVI.
>> YEAH, I AM--
>> I'M HERE IN MURRAY HILL.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> WHERE ANTHONY WEINER HAS
JUST COMPLETELY LOST THE
INDIAN VOTE.
>> Jon: WHAT DID HE DO?
>> WELL, THINGS WERE GOING
GREAT.
HE WAS HAVING DINNER WITH A
FEW INDIAN CONSTITUENTS AND
OUT OF NOWHERE HE DIPS HIS
SAMOSA IN HIS MANGO NUT
LASSI!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH IT.
>> DRINK IT!
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE GREEN
STUFF.
>> THAT'S FOR THE SAMOSA.
>> Jon: OKAY, I'M SORRY!
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THE PINKISH ONION
LOOKING THING.
>> YOU DON'T TOUCH THOSE,
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THOSE ARE
FOR.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T
REALIZE.
>> JON . YES, AL MADRIGAL, I
ASSUME ANTHONY WEINER HAS
DONE SOMETHING TO PISS OFF
THE LATINO COMMUNITY WHAT IS
IT THE CARLOS DANGER
THING.
>> Jon: WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT?
>> THAT'S THE DANGER SONG?
IN SPANISH.
WE'RE ACTUALLY FLATTERED BY
THE WHOLE CARLOS DANGER
THING. HE COULD HAVE PICKED
FRANCOIS DEGERE, OR SEAMUS
MCDANGER
OR FYVESH
McDANGERBERG BUT HE CHOSE US, I
THINK I'M VOTING FOR HIM.
>> I'M SORRY, HOLD ON A
SECOND.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE-- .
>> Jon: WHAT DID HE DO, WHAT
IS IT.
>> I JUST GOT A MASS TEXT
FROM THE WEINER CAMPAIGN,
HE'S TRYING TO GET THE
LATINOS TO THE POLLS.
BUT LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.
>> Jon: I DON'T-- OH, WOW.
(LAUGHTER)
SOME SORT OF WEIRD SPEEDY
GONZALEZ DICK PIC?
>> YES, WE DO NOT PUT
SOMBREROS ON OUR PENISES.
>> ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HELP
PROTECT IT FROM THE SUN.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, AL
AL MADRIGAL, AASIF MANDVI
AND JESSICA WILLIAMS.
TO YOU LOOK, WEINER HAS
ALIENATED -- -- I THOUGHT
FOR A SECOND WHEN HE SAID HE
DIPS HIS SAMOSA IN A MANGO
LASSI I THOUGHT IT WAS ALSO
A EUPHEMISM BUT I GUESS IT
WASN'T.
WEINER IS ALIENATING VOTERS BUT
NOT HIS BASE, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE IS GOING INTO A KOSHER BAKERY
ON HIGH HOLY DAYS AND
YELLING AT A GUY IN A YALMULKE
>> WHAT HAVE I TOLD THAT YOU
ARE YOU MY JUDGE.
>> YOU'RE FINE.
>> YOU TALK TO GOD AND WORK
OUT YOUR PROBLEMS BUT STAY
OUT OF THE PUBLIC
EYE. THAT IS WHY
THEY HAVE ELECTIONS.
>> AND YOU'RE PERFECT,
YOU'RE GOING TO JUDGE ME.
>> I'M NOT RUNNING FOR
OFFICE.
>> YOU KNOW WHO JUDGES ME?
YOU KNOW WHO JUDGES ME?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE VOTERS OF NEW
YORK CITY?
EVERYTHING THAT WEINER DOES
JUST LOOKS BAD NOW.
THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT
(APPLAUSE)
I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKES WHAT
ARE YOU YELLING AT THIS GUY
FOR.
IT'S NOT LIKE HE INSULTED
HIS WIFE, OH, REALLY ROLL
THAT TAPE.
>> EMBATTLED NEW YORK
MAYORAL CANDIDATE ANTHONY
WEINER IN AN EPIC WAR OF
WORDS AT THIS BROOKLYN
BAKERY AFTER HE PAID FOR
SOME TRADITIONAL ROSH
HASHANAH BAKED GOODS.
>> REAL SCUM BAG.
>> VERY NICE.
>> WEINER BEGINS TO LEAVE
THE BAKERY BUT THEN, LISTEN
CLOSELY.
>> THIS MAN SAUL KESSLER
MAKES A RACIAL SLUR ABOUT
WEINER'S WIFE HUMA ABADINE
>> Jon: AH.
WELL THEN [BLEEP] THAT GUY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OF COURSE, IT DOES RAISE AN
INTERESTING POSSIBILITY.
WHAT IF EVERYTHING ANTHONY
WEINER HAS DONE MAKES SENSE
IF YOU LOOK AT IT A LARGER
CONTEXT.
WHAT IF THERE IS ONE PIECE
OF INFORMATION THAT MAKES
EACH INCIDENT OKAY.
LIKE WHAT IF AT THAT WEST
INDIAN PARADE HE DIDN'T
REALIZE HIS MICROPHONE HAD
BEEN SET TO JAMAICAN ACCENT
AUTO TUNE.
NOW YOU MAY SAY ALL RIGHT,
FINE WHAT ABOUT THAT TEXT
MESSAGE HE SENT TO HIS
NON WIFE LADY WHERE HE SAID
HE WANTED TO QUOTE-- [BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)
MAYBE SHE HAD SOMETHING ON
HER FACE AND HE TRIED TO GET
HER ATTENTION BY GOING LIKE,
YOU KNOW--
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SHE WASN'T, YOU KNOW,
AND THEN HE THOUGHT OH, I
KNOW WHAT COULD GET THAT
OFF.
(LAUGHTER)
AN MAYBE INSTEAD OF SENDING
A PICTURE HE MEANT TO SEND A
PICTURE OF-- BUT HIS CAMERA
PHONE AUTO CORRECTED.
NAH, HE'S JUST A GUY WITH
SELF-CONTROL ISSUES NEVER
SHOULD HAVE RUN FOR MAYOR.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
