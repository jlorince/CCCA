LATE RALPH CIFARETTO.
THE DEMOCRATS SEEM STUNNED BY THE REACTION.
HERE'S WHY.
FOR MONTHS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TEARING EACH OTHER APART.
AND THE NEWS MEDIA WAS FOCUSED ON THAT.
ONE RIGHT WING GAFFE AFTER ANOTHER.
MICHELLE BACKMAN THEN VACCINES CAUSE MENTAL RETARDATION.
HERMAN CAIN'S UNORTHODOX LADY EMPLOYEE MEASURING TECHNIQUE.
RICK PERRY'S SUMMER RETREAT AT NNNN-HEAD.
NO MATTER WHAT DEMOCRATS DID OR SAID, NOBODY GAVE A (BEEP) BECAUSE ANY TIME THEY SAID IT,
THE MEDIA WOULD GET DISTRACTED BY NEWT GINGRICH'S OPEN MARRIAGE WITH A MOON WIFE,
LIKE NOBODY KNEW.
BUT LAST WEEK RICK SANTORUM CONCEDED.
PRIMARIES OVER.
GENERAL ELECTION ON.
ALL THE FIRE POWER, THE RIGHT IS WASTING ON EACH OTHER HAS NOW BEEN RETRAINED ON THEIR
ACTUAL OPPONENTS.
LIKE THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T REALIZE THEY HAD GONE FROM ENGLAND TO AMERICA WHERE THE
TRAFFIC IS NOW COMING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION.
DEMOCRATS GOT SO COMFORTABLE JUST GOING, OH, NOBODY IS COMING ON THE STREET.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW (BEEP), BOOM.
HERE'S HOW CRAZY IT IS AND POSSIBLY OVEREXCITED THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY GOT.
>> MY CAREER CHOICE WAS TO BE A MOTHER.
I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RESPECT CHOICES THAT WOMEN MAKE.
>> Jon: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
HILLARY ROSEN JUST MADE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PRO-CHOICE.
CATS AND DOGS, BLACK AND WHITE.
MITT ROMNEY CAN NOW CAMPAIGN ON MOTHERHOOD BEING HARD.
PROBABLY THE ONLY ISSUE HE HASN'T FLIP FLOPPED ON.
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY IS GOING TO DIG UP AN OLD CLIP OF ROMNEY SAYING THE OPPOSITE OF
MOTHERHOOD BEING HARD WORK.
>> 85% OF THE PEOPLE ON A FORM OF WELFARE ASSISTANCE IN MY STATE HAD NO WORK REQUIREMENT.
AND I WANTED TO INCREASE THE WORK REQUIREMENT.
I SAID, FOR INSTANCE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE A CHILD TWO YEARS OF AGE, YOU NEED TO GO TO WORK.
IT WILL COST THE STATE MORE PROVIDING THAT DAY CARE BUT I WANT THE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE
THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
I THINK MITT ROMNEY SAID HIS OWN WIFE HAD NO DIGNITY.
DOESN'T HE KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO HILLARY ROSEN.
RUN, MITT.
EVEN McCAIN
