WHO HAS LOOKED MORE LIKE THEACTUAL PERSON EVER.
HE SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN CALLEDMR. COLBERT.
>> Jon: HE SHOULD HAVE BEENCALLED THAT.
HE HAS SUCH A FLEXIBILITY OFFACE. I WOULD THINK HE IS ANANIMATOR'S DREAM.
>> YES, BECAUSE THEY FILM YOU.
>> Jon: WHAT WAS IT LIKE TOWORK WITH STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> WE GOT SO CLOSE.
JUST THE TIME BETWEEN SCENES ANDGOING OUT TO DINNERS I'VE NEVER
MET STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> I HAVE STILL NEVER METSTEPHEN COLBERT. THAT'S NOT
TRUE.
>> IT'S 100% TRUE.
I'VE SEEN HIM IN PASSING BUT I'MREALLY HOPING TO MEET HIM AT THE
PREMIERE.
NO EYE CONTACT.
>> I DON'T THINK THE SECURITYWILL LET THAT -- HE HAS
FRUITY AND BIG FRUITY.
>> HE HAS FRUITY AND BIG FRUITY?

EDDIE MURPHY HAD A SECURITY TEAMAND TWO GIGANTIC GUYS AT A
PREMIERE ONCE HE SAID THIS ISFRUITY AND BIG FRUITY.
>> BIG FRUITY IS BIGGER.
>> Jon: AND NOT MUCH.
I'M A PEABODY AND SHERMANAFICIONADO.
>> YOU ARE.
>> Jon: AS A YOUNG MAN I WOULDWATCH PEABODY AND SHERMAN AND
ALWAYS THOUGHT IT HADPOSSIBILITIES FOR A FEATURELENGTH
FILM.
[LAUGHTER]IT'S THAT OLD HOLLYWOOD
SCREENPLAY TROPE:  GENIUS DOGADOPTS A BOY AND BUILDS HIM ATIME
MACHINE TO TEACH HIM HISTORY.
SEE IT AGAIN.
>> Jon: I ALWAYS SAID TOMYSELF COMMANDER McBRAGG, NO
THAT'S NOT A FILM.
SHERMAN AND PEABODY IT'S AFILM.
IT'S VERY GOOD.
IT'S SMART.
YOU SEE SOME OF THESE ANIMATEDFILMS YOU GO WITH YOUR KIDS AND
YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE HELLOUT OF THERE.
THIS ONE VERY SMART, VERY FUNNY.
>> THANK YOU.
I GENUINELY AGREE.
THE GUY WHO CREATED THE ORIGINALSAID THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO
WRITE THEM TO AMUSE YOURSELFWHICH HE DID.
I THOUGHT THE ORIGINALS WERE SOGREAT.
>> THEY WERE GREAT.
>> I THINK THEY DID A NICE JOBOF DOING THE SAME THING.
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS: THIS CONFOUNDED ME WHEN I WAS
READING YOU ABOUT YOU.
YOU WERE FROM WHERE YOU GREW UPIN OREGON?
>> OREGON.
>> Jon: YOU ARE A METS FAN.
AS ARE YOU.
>> Jon: I'M A HUGE METS FANBUT I'M CURSED BY BIRTH.
>> I KNOW.
>> Jon: MY FATHER WAS FROMBROOKLYN AND WHEN THE DODGERS
LEFT.
>> HE WAS LIKE GUESS WHAT YOUARE GOING TO BE?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
NOT THAT HE DIDN'T IMPART ON MEDIMENTIA
AND GOITERS BUTTHAT IS THE ONE INHERITANCE.
HOW DID YOU GET SUCKED INTO THATABYSS?
>> I LIVED IN ASTORIA QUEENS FOR12 YEARS.
YES IT EXISTS.
>> Jon: DID YOU THINK THAT WASALMOST TOO ENTHUSIASTIC FOR
ASTORIA QUEENS.
MY WIFE AND I NOTICED THERE'S NOMETS HATS IN QUEENS.
IT'S ALL YANKEES.
WE ADDED TWO PEOPLE TO THETURNOUT OF 1300 PER GAME.
IT'S NOW 1302.
>> Jon: I USED TO GO THE LASTWEEK OF THE SEASON BECAUSE YOU
REALLY DO HAVE THE RUN OF THEPLACE.

[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: IT'S LIKE THAT FILM
NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM WHERE YOU GOIN --
[LAUGHTER]AT MIDNIGHT I HEARD THE TEAM
COMES ALIVE.
>> YOU ARE ON THE FIELD.
>> Jon: YOU CAN DO WHATEVERTHE HELL YOU WANT.
BUT YOU STILL, EVEN NOW, YOUSTAYED WITH IT.
IT STAYED WITH YOU.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S A DISEASE OF BEING ANETERNAL OPTIMIST.
I THINK THE METS ARE WINNING AWORLD SERIES EVERY YEAR.
AND I'M 0-FOR MANY, MANY OFTHOSE YEARS.
>> Jon: THEY WIN IT EVERY NOWAND AGAIN.
A DISEASE IS A PERFECT -->> THE TERRIBLE THING IS -- WE
WERE LIVING IN QUEENS IN LIKE2002, 2003 -- I HAVEN'T
EXPERIENCED ANY OF THAT.
ENDY CHAVEZ BROUGHT US SO CLOSE.
>> Jon: HE BROUGHT THAT CATCHIN AND I THOUGHT THIS ISDESTINY AND HE STRIKES
OUT AND GOES TO THE YANKEES ANDHELPED THEY WIN A WORLD SERIES.
