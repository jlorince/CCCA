GANGS.
I'M SAYING, ISN'T THERE ANYONE
WHO CAN DERAIL THIS ONE-WAY
TRAIN TO GITMO?
YOU KNOW, I SEEM TO RECALL A
PROMISING YOUNG MAN WHO ONCE
MADE AN EL QN CASE FOR OUR
VALUES.
>> WE'RE NOT A COUNTRY THAT RUNS
PRISONS THAT LOCKS PEOPLE AWAY
WITHOUT EVER TELLING THEM WHY
THEY'RE THERE OR WHAT THEY'RE
CHARGED WITH.
WE'RE NOT A NATION THAT LOCKS
PEOPLE UP WITHOUT CHARGING THEM.
>> Jon: BY I'M GOING TO WORK
TO CHANGE THAT.
REMEMBER THAT GUY?
I LOVED THAT GUY.
I THINK HE WAS IN SOMETHING
RECENTLY.
THE WHITE HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M SURE THAT HIS PRESS
SECRETARY CAN EXPLAIN EXACTLY
WHY OUR PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING
TO SIGN THIS AUTHORITARIAN PIECE
OF...
>> ANY BILL THAT CHALLENGES OR
CON TRAINS THE PRESIDENT'S
CRITICAL ABILITIES TO INCAPACITY
DANGEROUS TERRORISTS AND PROTECT
THE NATION WOULD PROMPT HIS
SENIOR ADVISERS TO RECOMMEND A
VETO.
>> Jon: CHALLENGE,
CONSTRAINTS?
YOU GOT THAT?
OBAMA IS GOING TO VETO THIS NOT
BECAUSE HE OBJECTS TO THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAVING NEAR
INFINITE POWER TO DETAIN WHOEVER
IT WANTS, BUT BECAUSE HE OBJECTS
TO THE EXECUTIVE NOT HAVING
TOTALLY INFINITE POWER.
APPARENTLY THERE IS A PROVISION
IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THE
PRESIDENT MUST DETAIN FOREIGN
TERROR SUSPECTS IN ONLY MILITARY
CUSTODY, UNLESS HE HAS A WAIVER.
HE'S GOT TO ISSUE A WAIVER.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO VETO
THIS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO
DO ANY PAPERWORK.
[LAUGHTER]
TO BE FAIR, IF YOU DO FIND
YOURSELF SUDDENLY AND PERHAPS
CAPRICIOUSLY BENEATH THIS BILL,
YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
HAVE YOUR STATUS REVIEWED ONCE A
YEAR, AND, B, THEY COULDN'T HOLD
YOU INDEFINITELY, JUST UNTIL THE
END OF THE WAR.
SO WHEN THE WAR ON TERROR ENDS,
AND TERROR SURRENDERS...
[LAUGHTER]
AND IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS A
HUMAN EMOTION, YOU'RE FREE TO
GO.
YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, WELL,
THIS LAW IN NO WAY APPLIES TO ME
BECAUSE I AM IN THE A TERRORIST.
WELL, LUCKILY YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE SUSPECTED OF
SUPPORTING OR AIDING ONE, AND
YOU MAY BE THINKING THAT THAT IN
NO WAY APPLIES TO YOU BECAUSE
YOU DON'T GO TO TERRORIST
MEETINGS.
OR SEND TERRORIST MAIL.
WELL, SUPPORT IS A PRETTY BROAD
TERM.
>> THERE ARE LAWS ON THE BOOKS
NOW THAT CHARACTERIZE WHO MIGHT
BE A TERRORIST.
SOMEONE MISSING FINGERS ON THEIR
HAND IS A SUSPECT ACCORDING TO
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
SOMEONE WHO HAS GUNS, SOMEONE
WHO HAS AMMUNITION THAT IS
WEATHER-PROOFED, SOMEONE WHO HAS
MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS OF FOOD IN
THEIR HOUSE CAN BE CONSIDERED A
POTENTIAL TERRORIST.
>> MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS OF FOOD?
MY BEANS, MY, MY BELOVED BEANS.
MAYBE NOT NOW, BUT IN THE FUTURE
EXECUTIVE POWER LIKE THIS COULD
BE EXERCISED VERY BROADLY, A
COMPLETELY INNOCENT PERSON WHO
MAY HAVE AS A CHILD ATTENDED A
MA DR.
IS A OR LATER ATTENDED EVENTS
WITH MEMBERS OF A KNOWN
TERRORIST GROUP OR SAT WITH
RADICAL CLERICS AND TO THIS DAY
ASSOCIATES WITH A MAN WITHOUT
ALL HIS FINGERS, THAT PERSON
COULD BE SUBJECT TO
INDEFINITE -- OH, MY GOD!
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> IT'S A TRAP.
