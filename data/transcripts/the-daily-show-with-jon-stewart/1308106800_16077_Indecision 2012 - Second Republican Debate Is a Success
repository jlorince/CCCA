(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, TRIVIALITIES ASIDE, IT
WAS TIME FOR THE DEBATE WHICH
BEGAN FOR THE TRADITIONAL
COMPARING OF THE CHRISTMAS
CARDS.
>> THE FATHER OF TWO BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTERS.
>> FATHER OF TWO, GRANDFATHER OF
THREE.
>> SEVEN CHILDREN.
>> FIVE SONS, AS YOU KNOW, FIVE
DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW.
16 GRAND KIDS.
>> I'VE GIVEN BIRTH TO FIVE
BABIES AND I'VE TAKEN 23 FOSTER
CHILDREN INTO MY HOME.
>> Jon: WE HAVE A WINNER.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
AND I JUST WANT TO ASK EVERYONE
ELSE HERE UP ON THE DAIS, HAVE
YOU EVER HAD TO DIVIDE A
BIRTHDAY CAKE INTO 28 EQUAL
PIECES?
BY THE WAY, THE ONLY CANDIDATE
NOT TO MENTION HIS KIDS AT ALL
WAS NEWT GINGRICH.
ALTHOUGH HE DID THE OTHERS TO A
MOST-WIVES CONTEST.
(LAUGHTER)
CONSECUTIVE, NOT CONCURRENT.
NICE TRY, ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, THE BABY-OFF WAS
REALLY JUST A PROXY BATTLE FOR
THE REAL BATTLE.
THE PRO-LIFE OFF.
>> I BELIEVE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M FIRMLY PRO-LIFE.
>> I STAND FOR THE RIGHT TO
LIFE.
>> NOT ONLY HAVE I BEEN
CONSISTENTLY PRO-LIFE BUT I'VE
TAKEN... I'VE NOT JUST TAKEN THE
PLEDGE, I'VE TAKEN THE BULLETS.
THE "NATIONAL REVIEW" ONLINE,
WHICH IS THE CONSERVATIVE
PUBLICATION SAID BASED ON
RESULTS, NOT JUST BASED ON WORDS
I WAS PROBABLY THE MOST PRO-LIFE
CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE.
>> MY FAVORITE MAGAZINE?
YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)
FAVORITE BOARD GAME?
NO DOUBT.
(LAUGHTER)
MY FAVORITE GARRETT?
CLOSE.
CLOSE.
LEIF.
(LAUGHTER)
MY FAVORITE WORD TO IMAGINE A
NATIVE OF CHINA STEREO TYPICALLY
MISPRONOUNCING?
(LAUGHTER)
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO NAIL ONE
OF THEM.
OF COURSE, AT A REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY DEBATE IT WOULD NOT BE
POSSIBLE TO GET TRIPPED UP BY
ADHERING TOO CLOSELY TO YOUR
IDEOLOGY.
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR IDEOLOGY
IS LIBERTARIAN.
>> A FIVE-YEAR-OLD CHILD OF AN
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WALKS INTO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM, DOES THE CHILD
GET CARE?
>> FIRST OFF, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
THE MANDATES.
WE BANKRUPT IT HAD HOSPITALS AND
THE SCHOOLS IN TEXAS AND OTHER.
WE CAN'T GIVE THEM EASY
CITIZENSHIP.
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT PROTECTING
OUR BORDERS.
>> AT A TIME WHEN GOVERNMENT
WASN'T... WE DIDN'T DEPEND ON
GOVERNMENT FOR EVERYTHING!
>> FREEDOM HAS SOLVED THESE KIND
OF PROBLEMS BEFORE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE CARE AND EVERYBODY
WILL STARVE TO DEATH AND DIE ON
THE STREETS WITHOUT MEDICAL
CARE.
THAT'S THE IMPLICATION OF THE
QUESTION.
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE AND YOU
SHOULDN'T ACCEPT IT.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY, CONGRESSMAN
PAUL, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS YES.
(LAUGHTER)
YES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIVE-YEAR-OLD SHOULD GET
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT.
YES.
MEANWHILE, THE NICE CLEAR ALPHA
CANDIDATE, MITT ROMNEY, WHOSE
FRONT-RUNNER STATUS AND
DISTINGUISHED ONLY MY SIDE BURNS
SAW A GHOST HAIRDO
(LAUGHTER)
...
>> ALLOWED TIME ABILITY-- AND
I'M SPEAKING RELATIVELY-- TO
MODERATE HIS POSITION.
LIKE WHEN ROMNEY WAS ASKED ABOUT
EXCLUDING MUSLIMS FROM HIS
CABINET.
>> NO, I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT
THE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS ARE
WELCOME IN THIS COUNTRY.
OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED ON A
PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS
TOLERANCE.
>> Jon: WOW.
OKAY.
WOW.
TERRIFIC.
WELL, LET'S JUST... THAT WAS
JUST...
>> I JUST WANT TO COMMENT FOR A
SECOND.
>> Jon: OH.
(LAUGHTER)
YES.
THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS
NEWT GINGRICH.
>> THE PAKISTANI WHO EMIGRATED
TO THE U.S., BECAME A CITIZEN,
BUILT A CAR BOMB WHICH LUCKILY
FAILED TO OFF GO OFF IN TIMES
SQUARE WAS ASKED BY THE FEDERAL
JUDGE HOW COULD SHE DONE THAT
WHEN HE SWORE AN OATH TO THE
UNITED STATES AND HE LOOKED AT
THE JUDGE AND HE SAID "YOU'RE MY
ENEMY.
I LIED."
I AM IN FAVOR OF SAYING TO
PEOPLE IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO
BE LOYAL TO THE UNITED STATES
YOU WILL NOT SERVE IN MY
ADMINISTRATION, PERIOD.
>> Jon: SO THE POINT OF YOUR
STORY IS PEOPLE LIE WHEN THEY
SWEAR OATHS OF LOYALTY TO THE
UNITED STATES AND YOUR SOLUTION
IS I WILL SAY TO THESE PEOPLE...
(LAUGHTER)
... THEY DON'T DO THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE MOST ANTICIPATED MATCHUP
WAS NOT GINGRICH/ROMNEY BUT IN
FACT PAWLENTY/ROMNEY ON FOX NEWS
SUNDAY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HE
DESIGNED OBAMACARE AFTER ROMNEY
CARE AND BASICALLY MADE IT
OBAMNEYCARE.
>> Jon: OH, NO YOU DIDN'T!
TWO NAMES TOGETHER WITH CARE IS
LIKE THE BRANGELINA OF
SOCIALIZED MEDICINE!
OH, DAMN.
IT'S ON!
>> YOUR RIVAL IS STANDING RIGHT
THERE.
IF IT WAS OBAMNEYCARE ON FOX
NEWS SUNDAY, WHY IS IT NOT
OBAMNEYCARE STANDING HERE WITH
THE GOVERNOR?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THE PERSON
I QUOTED IN SAYING HE LOOKED TO
MASSACHUSETTS FOR DESIGNING HIS
PROGRAM.
HE'S THE ONE WHO SAID IT'S A
BLUEPRINT AND THAT HE MERGED THE
TWO PROGRAMS AND SO USING THE
TERM OBAMNEYCARE WAS A
REFLECTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S
COMMENT THAT HE DECIDED
OBAMACARE ON THE MASSACHUSETTS
HEALTH CARE PLAN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: DID I SAY OBAMNEYCARE?
I MEANT TO SAY OBAPALIN CARE.
SHE'S NOT HERE, RIGHT?
OBAPALINCARE.
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STILL, THE NIGHT WAS A SURE-FIRE
SUCCESS, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO
THE ONLY METRIC THAT MATTERS TO
CNN.
>> SEVEN CANDIDATES UP ON STAGE
AS THEY TRY TO IMPRESS VOTERS OF
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE COUNTRY.
WE'VE BECOME, WE ARE TOLD, A
TRENDING TOPIC ON TWITTER.
>> Jon: A TRENDING TOPIC!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU MADE IT!
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
THIS WHEN IT WAS NATIONALLY
BROADCAST ON TELEVISION.
BUT TRENDING ON TWITTER!
(LAUGHTER)
IN FACT, THE DEBATE WAS TWITTER
TOPIC NUMBER THREE RIGHT UP
THERE BETWEEN HASHTAG BIG
MISTAKE AND HASHTAG WATCHING
CABLE.
-- TEEN WOLF.
KEEP IN MIND, THAT'S ALSO A
REFERENCE TO
