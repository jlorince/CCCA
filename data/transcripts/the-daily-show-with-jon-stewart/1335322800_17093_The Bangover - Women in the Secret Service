AS MUCH AS THIS SCANDAL MAY INDICATE THE NEED FOR PROCEDURES AND CULTURE IN THE SECRET
SERVICE THE PROBLEM MAY BE WIDESPREAD.
>> I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF THERE'S MORE WOMEN AS PART OF
THAT DETAIL IF THIS EVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
>> IT'S ONLY 11% OF THE AGENTS ARE WOMEN.

>> Jon: THEY ARE SUGGESTING THE WAY TO VIED THE SCANDALS ARE FOR THE SECRET SERVICE TO HIRE
MORE WOMEN.
KEEPING WOMEN IN THE GROUP COPES A LID ON BAD BEHAVIOR.

DON'T BOTHER REFORMING YOUR AGENCY'S TRAINING PROGRAM OR STEAK A NO (bleep) ON FACEBOOK
RULE JUST HIRE A COUPLE OF FEMALE AGENTS IN CHARGE OF BUZZ KILL.
