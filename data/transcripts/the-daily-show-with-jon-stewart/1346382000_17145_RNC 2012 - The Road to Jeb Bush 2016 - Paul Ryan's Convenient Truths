FOR YOU.
OH, COME ON.
ALL RIGHT.
NO DETAILS, BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND ON THIS WEEK'S THEME, THAT ANY
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IS SOLELY THE RESULT OF INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT.
>> AND I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS TOO.
IF YOU ARE FEELING LEFT OUT OR PASSED BY, YOU HAVE NOT FAILED.
YOUR LEADERS HAVE FAILED YOU.
>> Jon: TIME OUT, CHISELED CHIN MCNICE FACE-INGTON.
>> REALLY GOOD-LOOKING.
>> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
SO IF YOUR DRY CLEANING BUSINESS SECTION WITH A DEMOCRAT IN OFFICE, YOU BUILT THAT, BUT IF
YOUR DRY CLEANING BUSINESS FAILS WITH A DEMOCRAT IN OFFICE, THE GOVERNMENT (BLEEP) YOU.
SO SHOW ME MORE HARD TRUTHS.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT JUST IS A CONVENIENT TRUTH.
YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT IN HIS SPEECH I WOULD SETTLE FOR ANY TRUTH.
>> $760 BILLION FUNNELED OUT OF MEDICARE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> WHAT?  YOU MEAN THE $716 BILLION IN PAYMENTS TO PROVIDER EXACT SAME AMOUNT
REPUBLICANS ALSO PROPOSED FOR CUTS TO MEDICARE IN THEIR HIGHLY PRAISED WHAT WAS THE NAME OF IT?
RYAN BUDGET?  I CAN'T BELIEVE RYAN SEACREST WOULD SUGGEST -- WAIT A MINUTE!  RYAN!
>> HE CREATED A NEW BIPARTISAN DEBT COMMISSION.
THEY CAME BACK WITH AN URGENT REPORT.
HE THANKED THEM, SENT THEM ON THEIR WAY AND THEN DID EXACTLY NOTHING.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT.
THAT WAS THE BOWLES-SIMPSON PROPOSAL THAT WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY PRESENTED TO CONCERT
IN PART BECAUSE IT WAS VOTED DOWN BY A BLUE-EYED DREAM BOAT NAMED RYAN.
RYAN GOSLING -- WAIT A MINUTE!  YOU KNOW WHAT?  WE NEED TO TELL A PERSONAL STORY ABOUT AN AUTO
PLANT THAT CLOSED IN RYAN'S DISTRICT.
PERHAPS THIS WILL HOLD HARD TRUTHS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA, CANDIDATE OBAMA SAID I BELIEVE IF OUR GOVERNMENT IS THERE TO SUPPORT
YOU THIS PLANT WILL BE HERE FOR ANOTHER 100 YEARS.
THAT IS WHAT HE SAID IN 2008.
THAT PLANT DIDN'T LAST ANOTHER YEAR.
THE RECOVERY THAT WAS PROMISED IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT.
>> Jon: YEAH, EXCEPT THAT PLANT ANNOUNCED IN JUNE OF 2008 THAT IT WOULD BE STOPPING
PRODUCTION, HOLD ON A SECOND,
SIRI, WHO WAS PRESIDENT IN JUNE OF 2008?  GEORGE BUSH!  THANK
