>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE?
MICHAEL FASS BENDER IS GOING TO BE JOINING US FROM THE NEW
RIDLEY SCOTT FILM "PROMETHEUS." TRUE STORY, THE ORIGINAL TITLE
WAS "SPACE IS NICE." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THEN THEY THOUGHT, WHAT
ABOUT "PROMETHEUS"?
AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE HMM.
(LAUGHTER) LET'S START TONIGHT, OF COURSE,
IN WISCONSIN IN OUR LATEST INSTALLMENT OF...
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES, THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAYS
WHEN COWS SMOKED AND DRANK.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING!
BACK IN 2010 CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN BY
A MARGIN OF 52-46.
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE WALKER SLASHED BUDGETS AND CONSTRAINED UNIONS AND DID THE KIND OF
THINGS YOU WOULD IMAGINE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS WOULD DO.
SO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN SAID "WHOA!
WAIT!
WHAT?
WHAT?
YOU NEVER SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE THIS CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN-Y." (LAUGHTER)
THEY MOVED TO RECALL HIM LIKE A LEAD-PAINTED TOY MADE IN A NONUNION CHINESE SWEATSHOP.
(LAUGHTER) SO AFTER 18 MONTHS, A MILLION PETITION SIGNATURES AND, I DON'T
KNOW, $50ISH MILLION, GOVERNOR WALKER WOULD HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS TYRANNICAL BEHAVIOR.
AND FEEL THE WRATH OF A VENN VENGEFUL WISCONSIN ELECTORATE.
>> Reporter: SCOTT WALKER REMAINS WISCONSIN'S GOVERNOR.
>> BEATING TOM BARRETT 53-46.
>> Jon: HA HA!
TAKE THAT!
WANT TO GO AGAIN, TOUGH GUY?
HOW'S E 55% SOUND?
(LAUGHTER) YES, THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN SAYING... OH, I'M SORRY, YOU
DIDN'T HEAR US THE FIRST TIME?
YEAH, YEAH, WE SAID WE LIKED THE TYRANT-Y UNION CUTTING GUY.
HE'S OUR GUY.
LIKE WE SAID 16 MONTHS AGO.
SO WHAT THE (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) AND HAS NOW BECOME CUSTOMARY,
THE NEWS NETWORKS FUNCTIONEDLESS LAST NIGHT AS REPOSITORIES AS NEWS AND ANALYSISES AND MORE AS
EXTENSION OF THE WINNING AND LOSING CAMPAIGNS.
FOX WENT WITH GLOAT FEST 2012.
>> SCOTT WALKER ROUTE IT HAD RECALL.
IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE!
>> LOSING IN WISCONSIN, AGAIN, A PROGRESSIVE STATE, BY A LARGE,
HUMILIATING MARGIN.
>> THEY GOT TRUMPED.
THEY GOT SPANKED.
>> THEY'RE BASICALLY WALLOWING IN THEIR OWN UNPOPULARITY.
>> OBAMA'S GOOSE IS COOKED!
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: OR, TO PUT THAT A DIFFERENT WAY...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) SO IF FOX WAS HIGH, MSNBC MUST BE MSNB-SAD.
>> TO SAY I'M SHOCKED AND STUNNED IS PRETTY MUCH AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
>> Jon: SHOCKED AND STUND IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
NO, IT FEELS TONIGHT MORE LIKE MY HEART WAS (BLEEP)ED BY THE DEVIL.
(LAUGHTER) NO, WAIT, THAT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT.
(LAUGHTER) TO WANT I FEEL BETWEEN...
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SHOCKED,
STUNNED AND DEVIL HEART (BLEEP)ED.
(LAUGHTER) THIS IS ED SCHULTES.
INDEED, MSNBC PASSED THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF GRIEF LAST NIGHT.
STAGE ONE, DENIAL.
>> YOU KNOW, NBC IS CALLING IT FOR WALKER, OKAY, I THINK IT'S
AWFUL CLOSE AND THERE'S A LOT OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS YET THAT ARE STILL OUT.
>> Jon: YEAH, NO.
(LAUGHTER) STAGE TWO, DENIAL.
>> THIS WILL NOT BE A MASSIVE WIN FOR SCOTT WALKER.
>> Jon: YEAH.
(LAUGHTER) FINALLY STAGE THREE JUST REALLY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INDUSTRIAL-GRADE DENIAL.
>> TONIGHT THE REALLY BIG WINNER THE WISCONSIN RECALL ELECTION IS PRESIDENT OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: JUST LIKE OBAMA DREW IT UP ON THE CHALK BOARD, HEY,
GUYS, I GOTTEN A IDEA.
WHAT IF WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE THE CORE OF WHAT WE BELIEVE SOUNDLY REJECTED BY
VOTERS IN A SWING STATE FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE NATIONAL
