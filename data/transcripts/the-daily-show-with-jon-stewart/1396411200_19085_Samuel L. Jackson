THE EVOLUTION OF NICK FURYCONTINUES.
>> Jon: IT DOES INDEED AND MAYI SAY IT'S BEEN UPGRADED.
>> THANK YOU.>> Jon: I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE.
I LIKE TO FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.
>> Jon: THEY WERE NEVER ABLE,THE TECHNOLOGY OF MOVIES WAS
NEVER AT THE ADVANCED LEVEL THATIT IS NOW THAT THE SUPER HEROES
COULD ON SCREEN REALLY APPEARREALISTIC AND IT COULD -- YOU
COULD GET THE JOLT.I WONDER IF THAT'S
WHY IT'S ONLY NOW THIS THESEMOVIES ARE SO BIG.
>> I THINK PART OF IT IS THE
TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO I THINK PARTOF IT IS THE ACCESSIBILITY OF
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DOAS REAL PEOPLE NOW. WHEN I WAS
A KID I WOULD READ A COMIC BOOKAND WANT TO BE IN A WORLD WHERE
THERE WERE WOMEN WALKING AROUNDIN TIGHTS WITH GREEN HAIR AND
BLUE HAIR AND FOLKS HAD CAPES ONAND THEY WERE WEARING BOOTS.
>> Jon: THEY CALL THAT SANFRANCISCO.
>> EXACTLY AND NOW WE HAVEALL THAT AND PEOPLE ARE WALKING
AROUND TALKING ON THINGS ANDLOOKING AT STUFF ON THE LITTLE
DEVICES. SO IT'S ALLVERY REAL FOR US. THE ONLY
THING THAT'S MISSING FOR US ISTHIS CAT THAT ACTUALLY FLIES.
>> Jon: YES.
>> AND LANDS SOMEWHERE.
HE'S PROBABLY OUT THERESOMEWHERE JUST WAITING TO COME
OUT.
>> Jon: I BELIEVE THAT'SRIGHT. I WONDER. I'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT SCIENCETAKES ITS CUES FROM ALL OF
THE GREAT, ASIMOV AND WELLS,ALL THE GREAT SORT OF FICTION
WRITERS AND SCIENCE FICTIONWRITERS AND THEY SEE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT IN A COMIC STRIP ANDGO I BET I CAN MAKE THAT.
THEY ARE TAKING THEIR CUES FROMTHE IMAGINATIONS OF A GUY LIKE
STAN LEE.
>> THERE'S THAT AND THERE'S ALSOTHE FACT THAT -- I USED TO DREAM
I COULD FLY.
I USED TO DREAM I COULD BREATHEUNDER WATER AND ALL THAT KIND OF
STUFF.
I WANTED TO DO IT REALLYBADLY.
NOW I PUT ON THAT COSTUME AND IFALL INTO THAT MARVEL PLAYGROUND
AND I'M LIKE I'M IN HEAVEN.
THIS IS HAPPENING.I PUT MY EYE PATCH ON
AND I WALK OUT THERE ANDI'M INVINCIBLE, MAN.
>> Jon: THEY CREATEIT REALISTICALLY.
IN THE OLD DAYS A SUPERHERO LIKE
HULK THEY WOULD JUST FIND THEBIGGEST GUY THEY COULD
AND PAINT HIM GREEN AND THATWOULD BE --
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT THE EFFECTS NOWAND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT
SURROUNDS IT.
IS IT -- WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT,WHEN YOU ARE MAKING IT IS IT
TEDIOUS? IS IT --DO YOU FEEL THE
EXCITEMENT OR YOU IN SPANDEX INFRONT OF A
GREEN FLAT AND THEY ARE LIKE NOWTHE MONSTER IS COMING?
>> IN THE BEGINNING YOU SORT OFFELT THAT WAY.
BACK WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOINGSTAR WARS IT WAS JUST A GREEN
ROOM AND WE HAD SOME THINGS INTHERE.
I HAD A LIGHT SABER ANDGEORGE WOULD SAY OK
THERE'S A THING ATTACKING YOU.
I WOULD SAY HOW BIG IS IT?
HE WOULD SAY AS BIG AS ANS.U.V.?
I GO, REALLY.
I SAID HOW FAST IS IT?
HE SAID FAST AS YOU WANT IT TOBE?
I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT ANDYOU'LL DRAW STUFF AROUND ME?
HE SAID YOU KICK ALL THE ASS YOUWANT AND WE'LL MAKE SURE IT
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE BADDESTMOTHER (bleep) IN THE UNIVERSE.
SO I'M BACK IN MY ROOM, I'MJUMPING AND RUNNING, AND THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN I GO TO THEMOVIE IT'S LIKE (bleep).
LOOK AT ME.
>> Jon: AMAZING.
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
>> IT'S ALL THAT AND MORE BUTWHEN YOU ARE DOING (bleep)
LIKE THAT CAR CHASE.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> WE HAD LIKE -->> Jon: THAT LOOKS ACTUALLY
DANGEROUS.
>> WE HAD LIKE 12 CARS THAT ALLDID DIFFERENT (bleep).
WHEN YOU SEE THE MOVIE THERE'SONE POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE 19
GUYS FIRING BULLETS AT IT.
THE WINDOWS ARE JUST RESISTINGTHE BULLETS.
I'M JUST SITTING IN THE CAR LIKE
THAT'S LIKE A DOPE ASS FEELINGLIKE YEAH MOTHER (bleep).
