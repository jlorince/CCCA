OF SHOWS.
OF COURSE DEMOCRATS ARE
DEBATING THE ISSUE AS WELL,
LET'S CHECK IN.
>> JON STEWART TOOK THIS
ISSUE ON AND SAID, WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I
LOVE THE BLUNT AMENDMENT,
BECAUSE, HE SAY, I'M AN
EMPLOYER AND I BELIEVE THAT
HUMOR IS THE BEST MEDICINE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF
ALL, I CAN'T POSSIBLY SOUND
THAT JEWISH.
SECOND OF ALL, YOU ARE
TAKING THAT OUT OF CONTEXT
AND MISCONSTRUING WHAT I
SAID AND THAT'S MY JOB TO DO
TO YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS THE BIT WE DID.
LOOK AT THE BIT WE DID.
>> I, ALONG WITH READERS
DIGEST MAGAZINE BELIEVE
LAUGHTER IS THE BEST
MEDICINE, AND YOU KNOW, IF I
REMEMBER CORRECTLY ONE OF MY
WRITERS HAS BEEN FIGHTING
THE FLU FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
NOW.
HEY, ELLIOTT, COME ON OUT
HERE.
>> THIS IS NOT ANOTHER
TREATMENT S IT.
>> Jon: YEAH, UH--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WHY CAN'T YOU GET ME
ZITHROMAX.
>> Jon: ZITHROMAX, THAT SAY
FUNNY WORD.
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
SEE NOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A
DECENT IDEA, ONCE IT HITS
THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED
STATES SENATE.
>> HUMOR IS THE BEST
MEDICINE, HE SAID.
SO HE SAID, SO, THAT'S WHAT
I AM GOING TO DO.
HE SAID I HAVE AN EXAMPLE
HERE AND THEN THIS GUY COMES
ON TO THE STAGE WITH A VERY
BAD COLD AND FLU AND HE IS
SNEEZING AND HE SAYS,
MR. STEWART, DO I HAVE TO
HAVE ANOTHER TREATMENT NOW?
AND HE SAYS YES.
AND HE STAKES A SELLINGER
BOTTLE AND HE SPRAYS IT ALL
OVER THE GUY, THAT WAS HIS
TREATMENT BECAUSE IT WAS
FUNNY AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
LAUGH AND THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO CURE THIS PERSON.
AND HE SAID NOT ANOTHER
TREATMENT.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PULL MY HEART OUT OF MY
CHEST AND EAT IT IN FRONT OF
ME.
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY THAT BRINGS DOES TO
OUR NEWEST COMPILATION BOX
SET, BARBARA BOXER MEANDERS
THROUGH EPISODES OF THE
DAILY SHOW LIKE ONE OF YOUR
MOM'S FRIENDS.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS SET HAS GOT ALL YOUR
DAILY SHOW FAVORITES.
IT'S GOT I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY DID THAT JOHN KERRY
SPEAKS SLOWLY.
WE MUSED LOOK.
BUT JOHN OLIVER, THAT'S
ABSURD.
AND OF COURSE NEWT GINGRICH
GETS MARRIED A LOT.
>> HAVING JUST WATCHED A
VIDEO CLIP, JON MAKES A
FUNNY FACE AND BANGS ON HIS
DESK, YOU KNOW, AT WHICH
POINT HE THEN EXPLAINS IN A
VERY EXASPERATED MANNER, ARE
YOU-- KIDDING ME.
>> Jon: BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.
IF YOU ACT NOW, WILL YOU
ALSO GET SOME LEGENDARY
DAILY SHOW MOMENTS INCLUDING
OUR ALL TIME CLASSIC DONALD
TRUMP EATS PIZZA WITH A
FORK.
>> DONALD TRUMP CONSUMES THE
DAILY WHEEL OF SAUSAGE
CHEESE BUT GET THIS HE USES
A YOU TENSE IL RATHER THAN
JUST HIS HANDS.
WELL, JON IS NOT LETTING HIM
GET AWAY WITH THAT.
HE THEN PROCEEDS TO
DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER
METHOD FOR INGESTING THE
SAVORY NEW YORK STAPLE,
USING AN ITALIAN ACCENT,
DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL
GENEALOGICAL RECORDS REVEAL
HIM TO BE OF EASTERN
EUROPEAN JEWISH ANCEST REE.
IT'S TERRIFIC.
>> Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT,
HOPEFULLY BARBARA BOXER WILL
NO LONGER DO MY JOKES ON THE
FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND SHE
WON'T GET A CHANCE TO
DO-- SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME
IN REALTIME NOW.
