IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PAKISTAN'S
LEADERS, INCLUDING FORMER
PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF, HAVE SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, FOR YEARS U.S.
OFFICIALS, INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS, HAVE BEEN SAYING
OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS, IN FACT, IN
PAKISTAN.
YOU HAVE BEEN DENYING THAT FOR
YEARS NOW CATEGORICALLY SAYING,
NO, HE'S IN AFGHANISTAN.
DO YOU NOW ADMIT YOU WERE WRONG?
>> NEW YORK I DON'T THINK I WAS
EVER DENYING.
I WAS ASKED EVERYWHERE, AND MY
FIRST RESPONSE INVARIABLY ALWAYS
WAS THAT I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
>> Jon: OKAY.
TWO THINGS, ONE, I THINK IT'S
RUDE TO TALK ON THE PHONE WHEN
YOU'RE BEING INTERVIEWED.
[LAUGHTER]
AND NUMBER TWO, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SAYING, WE'RE SAYING, WHEN
YOU SAID "I DON'T KNOW," YOU
KNEW!
YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT THE
I.S.I., THE PAKISTANI
INTELLIGENCE, THE MILITARY, THE
GOVERNMENT, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY
IDEA BIN LADEN WAS THERE OR HAVE
ANY INVOLVEMENT IN PUTTING BIN
LADEN THERE?
>> I THINK I.S.I. MUST BE
UTTERLY STUPID TO PUT THEM IN
SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE, HIDING
THEM IN SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE
THAT.
THAT IS NOT WHAT I.S.I. WOUND
HAVE DONE, CERTAINLY NOT.
>> Jon: SO YOUR DEFENSE IS
BASICALLY THE I.S.I. IS WAY TOO
SMART TO PUT BIN LADEN IN SUCH
AN OBVIOUS PLACE, BUT FAR TOO
CLUELESS TO KNOW HE WAS THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY'RE IN THAT MAGIC SWEET
SPOT.
[LAUGHTER]
SMART ENOUGH NOT TO DO IT,
DUMB ENOUGH NOT TO KNOW.
AND BY THE WAY, HIDING BIN
LADEN, HIDING?
BIN LADEN WASN'T HIDING IN
PAKISTAN.
HE WAS CHILLIN' IN PAKISTAN,
CRASHIN',  IF YOU WILL.
IF WALDO HID THE WAY OSAMA BIN
LADEN DID, I WOULDN'T FIND THOSE
BOOKS SO INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING.
LOOK, THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE!
HE'S IN THE GIANT, HIGH-WALLED
COMPOUND.
HE'S RIGHT THERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND NOW YOU'RE LIKE, OH, THAT
WAS OSAMA'S HOUSE, THE TALL
LANKY GUY?
WE THOUGHT MAYBE JEFF GOLDBLUM
HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A SUMMER
RETREAT, HAD GROWN A BEARD AND
WAS BURNING ALL HIS TRASH.
YOU KNOW HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE,
ECCENTRIC.
YOU KNOW WHAT HURTS THE MOST?
YOU MAY RECALL PAKISTAN'S
THEN-LEADER, PERVEZ MUSHARRAF,
WAS ON THIS VERY PROGRAM TO
PROMOTE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY A
LITTLE LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AGO.
I GAVE THIS MAN A TEA AND
TWINKIE WELCOME.
TO YOUR HEALTH, SIR.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: MMM.
IS IT GOOD?
WHERE'S OSAMA BIN LADEN?
[LAUGHTER]
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> Jon: OH, DON'T YOU?
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?
WELL, GUESS WHAT...
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HE LIED TO ME.
HE LIED TO ME.
WELL, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL
YOU, PERVEZ MUSHARRAF.
I SAID I READ YOUR BOOK.
I DIDN'T READ YOUR BOOK.
AND THOSE TWINKIES WERE OVER 40
YEARS OLD.
I GOT THEM ON A CAMPING TRIP
WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
