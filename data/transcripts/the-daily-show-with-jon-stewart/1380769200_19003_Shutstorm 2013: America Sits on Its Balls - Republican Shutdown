MORE GALLING THAN THE HOUSEREPUBLICANS MISPLACED ILL
PRIORITIZED OUTRAGE IS THEIRINSISTENCE THAT THE
PARTY THAT HAS RUN FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS OR SO ON THE IDEA THAT
GOVERNMENT IS THE ENEMY IS SADDENED TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT
CRIPPLED LIKE THIS.
>> I DIDN'T COME HERE TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
>> IT'S CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HARRY REID WOULD
RATHER SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN.
>>FOR THEM TO SAY THAT THIS IS AREPUBLICAN SHUTDOWN
IS UNBELIEVABLE.
>> WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT OPEN.
>> WE DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO SHUT DOWN.
THAT NARRATIVE IS FALSE.
>> IT'S ONLY THE DEMOCRATS THAT TALK ABOUT WANTING TO SHUT DOWN
THE GOVERNMENT.
>> [BLEEP]! I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
[APPLAUSE]I'M SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.
I MEANT TO SAY BULL [BLEEP].
[LAUGHTER]WHEN, WHEN DID THE BIG
GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATS BECOME THE NO-GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATS?
YOU -- [LAUGHTER]
SELF-RIGHTEOUS ZEBRA QUEEFS.
[LAUGHTER]YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF SCORE THAT
WOULD GET ME IN SCRABBLE?
ZEBRA QUEEFS.
SIX WEEKS AGO, THERE WAS A LETTER THAT FLOATED THE IDEA OF
USING TO PARAPHRASE JAMES MADISON, THE POWER OF THE PURSE
AS A WEAPON TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES.
LAYING OUT A PLAN TO DEFUND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT
OF OBAMA CARE IN ANY CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS BILL.
ESSENTIALLY SAYING, IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE YOUR BELOVED PANDA
CAM AGAIN, YOU WILL LOSE IT.
THAT WAS SIGNED BY 80 HOUSE REPUBLICANS.
IT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS GIVE AWAY OF WHAT THEY WERE PLANNING SINCE
THE GUY ON PRISON BREAK SHOWED UP IN JAIL WITH A MAP OF THE
JAIL TATTOOED ON HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
[LAUGHTER]SO ENOUGH.
[APPLAUSE]ENOUGH PRETENDING.
STOP TRYING TO PHOTO-OP YOUR WAYOUT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
[BLEEP]. >> ALL OF US HERE SITTING AT A
TABLE WAITING FOR THE SENATE DEMOCRATS TO JOIN US SO WE CAN
BEGIN TO RESOLVE OUR DIFFERENCES.
>> Jon: I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE GUYS.
THEY LOOK LIKE A FOCUS GROUP FORA HIGH FIBER BREAKFAST CEREAL.
[LAUGHTER]I'M KIDDING.
ACTUALLY THAT GROUP LOOKS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES.
[LAUGHTER]BY THE WAY --
[APPLAUSE]WHAT WAS THIS MEETING THREE
YEARS AGO?
WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT TO HASH OUT YOUR
DIFFERENCES.
I CAN'T TELL IF YOU -- IN FLEXIBLE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA
THAT NEVER EXISTED FETISHIZING ZEBRA QUEEFS -- I'M GOING TO
REUSE ZEBRA QUEEFS -- I CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE DUMB OR
THINK WE ARE.
SO TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WE HAVE JOHN OLIVER JOINING US.
[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]>> THESE GUYS WERE CLAMORING
MONTHS AND MONTHS WE'RE GOING TODEFUND OBAMA CARE OR NOT FUND
THE BUDGET.
NOW THEY'RE SAYING WHAT?
WE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
THEY THINK WE'RE STUPID.
ARE THEY STUPID?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
>> IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.
THEY THINK YOU'RE STUPID.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> AND NOT YOU, EVERYBODY. >> Jon: BUT THESE GUYS ARE
RISKING A TREMENDOUS BACKLASH. >> LET ME CORRECT YOU THERE.
ACTUALLY RISKING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
LOOK, CONGRESS ALREADY HAS A 90%INCUMBENCY RATE THAT GOES ALONG
WITH A 10% APPROVAL RATING.
THE ONLY PREVIOUS INSTANCE OF THAT LEVEL OF DISAPPROVAL
COMBINED WITH THAT LEVEL OF MARKET RETENTION IS TIME-WARNER
CABLE.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WOW.
>> THAT'S THE ONLY ON-RECORD INSTANCE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE SAYING, IF I'M HEARING YOU CORRECTLY, YOU'RE
SAYING CONGRESS IS THE TIME-WARNER CABLE OF DEMOCRACY?
>> I KNOW THAT'S INCREDIBLY HARSH.
>> Jon: YES. >> BUT IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY
FAIR.
BUT THROUGH THE TIME-HONORED TRADITION OF ELECTORAL
CORRUPTION AND GERRYMANDERINGTHESE GUYS ARE INVINCIBLE.
LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?
>> Jon: WOW.
>> GO AHEAD. >> Jon: I'M GOING TO SAY A WITCH
BEING ELECTROCUTED INSIDE A BAT'S VAGINA.
>> YOU'RE CLOSE.
IT'S LOUISIANA'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.
OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES NO PHYSICAL SENSE.
WHEN IT WAS REDRAWN IN 2010, THEWHITE MAJORITY INCREASED FROM 60
TO 74% TAKING IT FROM REPUBLICANTO TURBO REPUBLICAN.
AND IS REPRESENTED BY BILL CASSIDY, ONE OF THE 80 REPS THAT
SIGNED THAT LETTER AND WHO WON IN 2012 WITH A SADDAM
HUSSEIN-LIKE NEARLY 70% MARGIN OF VICTORY.
HE'S JUST ONE OF CONGRESS' NEW DANGEROUS BREED OF SUPER
INCUMBENTS. >> Jon: EVEN IF HIS ACTIONS ARE
UNPOPULAR AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, HE PAYS NO PRICE ELECTORALLY?
>> NO.
HE'S AN ELECTORAL X MAN.
HE CAN SHOOT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, REFUSE TO RAISE THE
DEBTCEILING, POISON A BASKET OF
KITTENS IN FRONT OF ANOTHER BASKET OF KITTENS SO LONG AS
OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT AND HE WOULD BE FINE.
>> Jon: THIS IS -- I THINK -- >> WHAT?
>> Jon: OUR ONLY HOPE -- AND I SAY THIS --
>> I WANT TO HEAR IT. >> Jon: ENOUGH OF THE REMAINING
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN.
SACK UP AND COMBINE WITH ENOUGH DEMOCRATS TO GO AGAINST THESE
MUTANTS AND ELECTORALLY WIPE THEM OUT FOR GOOD FOR THE GOOD
OF OUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.
THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
>> UH-HUH.
[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY
