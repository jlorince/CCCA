MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WHAT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OURGUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE SO EXCITED
JON RONSON. HE'S ONE OF OURFAVES, BEEN ON THE SHOW TWICE,
HE'S KILLED IT BOTH TIMES, SOTONIGHT REALLY THE PRESSURE IS
ON HIM IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
TREMENDOUS. VERY FUNNY MAN.
I WANTED TO CHECK BACK THOUGH INWITH SOME STORIES WE'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING.
LAST NIGHT WE SPOKE ABOUT THEDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
AND THEIR RATHER IRONICDISREGARD FOR THE AFFAIRS OF
VETERANS.
(LAUGHTER)SPECIFICALLY THEIR RELATIVELY
NEW "CHOICE PROGRAM", DESIGNEDTO HELP VETERANS RECEIVE
OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH CARETO AVOID A WAIT TIME OF FOUR TO
FIVE...
EONS.
(LAUGHTER)THE CHOICE PROGRAM REQUIRES
THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T WAITED 30DAYS YOU MUST LIVE MORE THAN
40 MILES FROM A V.A. CLINIC.
"AS THE CROW FLIES."
BECAUSE THAT IS THE LEASTMEANINGFUL WAY TO JUDGE HOW HARD
IT IS TO GET SOMEWHERE FORNON-CROWS!
>> Jon: I CANNOT BELIEVE HOWYOUNG I LOOKED.
(LAUGHTER)WELL!
GUESS WHAT, FOLKS -- NOT SIXHOURS AFTER WE AIRED THAT
DAMNING PIECE OF INVESTIGATINGJOKELISM, THE V.A. FOLDS.
>> OFFICIALS SAY THEY'RERELAXING A RULE THAT MAKES IT
HARD FOR SOME VETERANS IN RURALAREAS TO PROVE THEY LIVE AT
LEAST 40 MILES FROM A V.A.
HEALTH SITE.
>> THE CHANGE NOW MEASURESTHE TRIP BY DRIVING MILES RATHER
THAN "AS THE CROW FLIES."
>> Jon: BOOM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SORRY, CROWS! SORRY, CROWS,
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SORRY, CROWS! SORRY, CROWS,
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TODRIVE TO THE DOCTOR JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE.
AND WHAT'S MORE, THAT SMALLADJUSTMENT IN LANGUAGE
DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF VETERANSELIGIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOW, SOME NAYSAYERS OUT THERE
WILL SAY, BUT THE V.A. MADE THATDECISION BEFORE "THE DAILY SHOW"
WROTE, TAPED AND AIRED THATPIECE, AND "THE DAILY SHOW" JUST
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BECAUSETHAT INFORMATION HADN'T BEEN
MADE PUBLIC YET.
(BLEEP) THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I SAY CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS
DUE!
OH, YEAH, MY FRIENDS!

YOU KNOW, MY GUITAR ISN'TSOUNDING AS GUITAR
SOUNDY AS I WOULD LIKE THAT, TO.SO --
