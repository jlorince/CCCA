(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WE ARE HERE TALKING TO FORMER
SECRETARY OF STATE CONDOLEEZZA
RICE.
NOW, MY THEORY ABOUT IRAQ WAS
THAT PRESIDENT BUSH INVADED IT
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE WORDS
THAT END WITH "Q."
HE FEELS IT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS
ABDICATION OF SEMANTICS AND
SPELLING.
(LAUGHTER)
IF YOU WERE TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT
AND MAKE A CASE FOR IRAN AS A
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING STATE AND
WORKING ON WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION AND EVEN SAUDI
ARABIA TO SOME EXTENT, COULDN'T
YOU HAVE JUSTIFIED INVADING A
WHOLE HOST OF VARIETY OF
COUNTRIES IN THAT AREA?
>> WELL, LET ME SET IRAN ASIDE
BECAUSE IRAN IS A SPECIAL CASE
UNTO ITSELF.
BUT REMEMBER THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN
DRAGGED US INTO THE WAR BY
INVADING KUWAIT.
WE THEN EXPELLED HIM.
FOR TEN YEARS HE VIOLATED THE
TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT HE
SIGNED TO END THE WAR, INCLUDING
IN 1998 PRESIDENT CLINTON
ACTUALLY LODGED CRUISE MISSILES
AT IRAQ BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET
SATISFACTION ABOUT WHAT WAS
GOING ON WITH HIS PPLD.
THE INSPECTORS NEVER THEN GO
BACK INTO THE COUNTRY.
HE HAD, IN FACT, BEEN SUCH A BAD
THREAT THAT THE UNITED STATES
CONGRESS PASSED SOMETHING CALLED
THE IRAQI LIBERATION ACT IN 199
THAT SAID BASICALLY THAT PART OF
THE WORLD WOULD NEVER BE SAFE
UNTIL SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS GONE.
SO THIS WAS NOT A FIGMENT OF
SOMEBODY'S IMAGINATION IN 2003.
WE HAD TRIED WHEN WE FIRST CAME
IN TO STRENGTHEN THE CONTAINMENT
REGIME AROUND SADDAM HUSSEIN.
I REMEMBER A SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
LONG SUNDAY AFTERNOON MEETING IN
WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE
COULD WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
SMART SANCTIONS THAT WOULD HURT
THE REGIME AND NOT THE PEOPLE?
WE HAD THESE NO-FLY ZONES WHERE
OUR AIRCRAFT WOULD FLY TO KEEP
HIS AIRCRAFT ON THE GROUND.
HE WOULD SHOT AT THEM.
I REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT SAYING
"WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IF HE
SHOOTS DOWN AN AMERICAN PILOT?"
AND, OF COURSE, HE PUT
400,000 PEOPLE IN MASS GRAVES
AND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
WERE NOT A THEORETICAL ISSUE
WITH HIM, HE'D USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE
AND AGAINST THE IRANIANS.
SO HE WAS A THREAT.
WHAT CHANGED AFTER 2003 IS THAT
AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE 9/11 WE DON'T
WANT TO LET THREATS SIT THERE
AND MATERIALIZE AND HE HAD BEEN
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS ON
THE LIST FOR A LONG TIME.
WE TRIED TO DEAL WITH IT
DIFFERENTLY BEFORE 9/11 AND THEN
AFTERWARDS PUT HIM ON NOTICE
THROUGH THE U.N., RESOLUTION
1441 PASSED UNANIMOUSLY THAT HE
WAS A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL
PEACE AND SECURITY, HE HAD TO
COME CLEAN OR HE WOULD FACE
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.
SO THAT'S THE SEQUENCE ONE NEEDS
TO UNDERSTAND.
>> IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
I THINK IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT IT
AND NOT SEE OTHER DICTATORS OF
EQUAL THREATS THAT ALSO ARE IN
THE REGION AND ALSO HAVE THAT
NORTH KOREA, IRAN, THOSE THINGS.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SEEMED
TO ME THAT THERE WAS A CERTAINTY
ABOUT THE WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION AND THAT REALLY WAS
THE FOCUS OF... YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY ALWAYS ASKS FOR YOU
KNOW WHAT YOU KNEW NOW, WOULD
YOU STILL HAVE GONE IN?
AND PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY "OH,
ABSOLUTELY, I'M GLAD HE'S GONE."
MY QUESTION WOULD BE IF YOU KNOW
WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT THE
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION DO
YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO GO TO
WAR?
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS THE
ESSENCE OF THE QUESTION.
I THINK THE COMPLAINT PEOPLE
HAVE IS THEY FELT THE
ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY
EFFICIENT AT SELLING US ON THE
IDEA OF THE DANGER THAT HE
PRESENTED WITH VERY SPECIFIC
THOUGHTS OF WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION THAT TURNED OUT TO
BE NOT THE CASE.
>> THE REASON I GIVE YOU THAT IS
THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS A
FULL-BLOWN THREAT TO THE
INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM WELL BEFORE
WE CAME TO OFFICE.
AS I SAID, NECESSITATING
MILITARY FORCE AGAINST HIM
BEFORE.
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
WHAT YOU KNOW TODAY CAN AFFECT
YOU YOU DO TOMORROW BUT NOT WHAT
YOU DID YESTERDAY.
NOW THE FACT IS THE INTELLIGENCE
REPORTING SAID HE HAS
RECONSTITUTES HIS BIOLOGICAL AND
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
THAT WAS A UNANIMOUS VIEW OF THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
IF HE'S LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES,
HE WILL RECONSTITUTE HIS NUCLEAR
PROGRAM IN EITHER A YEAR IF HE
GETS FOREIGN HELP OR BY THE END
OF THE DECADE.
NOW YOU KNOW HIS HISTORY.
HE'S TRIED TO ASSASSINATE GEORGE
H.W. BUSH, HE'S TAKEN US TO WAR,
USED WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET THAT
THREAT SIT THERE.
>> Jon: WELL, I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOUR COMING BY AND I
DO FEEL LIKE I HAVE A BETTER
SENSE OF WHY WE DID MAKE THAT
HUGE MISTAKE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
"NO HIGHER HONOR" IS ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW.
CONDOLEEZZA RICE.
YOU PROBABLY NOTICE PROBABLY
THAT INTERVIEW GOT CUT OFF THERE
BECAUSE IT'S REAL LONG.
SO WE PUT THE REST OF IT UP ON
THE WEB AND DON'T WORRY IT GETS
MORE INTERESTING AND THEN LESS
INTERESTING AGAIN AND THEN...
(LAUGHTER)
SORT OF WEIRDLY ROMANTIC AND
THEN KIND OF TENSE AGAIN AND
THEN THERE'S AN ARM WRESTLING
AND THEN... THEN WE BOTH SLEEP
AND
(LAUGHTER)
THEN THERE'S AN OMELET BAR AND
THEN...
