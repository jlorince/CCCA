ONE GUY BIDES HIS TIME WITHSUDOKU, HE IS JUST BORED OUT OF
HIS MIND.
I JUST REALIZED, THE HOLOGRAMS,THE VIRTUAL SETS, THE BRITISH
MEDIA HAS CONTRACTED ADEVASTATING CASE OF
CNNITIS.
IT'S WHEN A NEWS ORGANIZATIONSPENDS A GREAT DEAL OF TIME
CREATING VISUALS AND SET PIECESWHICH SERVE NO DISCERNIBLE
PURPOSE AND SHED NOPERCEPTIBLE LIGHT AND ACTUALLY

I MEAN UNLESS THERE WAS SOMEUNUNFORTUNATE
IMAGE CRYSTALLIZINGINCIDENT.
>> AND IN THAT LABOURCAMPAIGN SYMBOLIZED BY
MILIBAND BREAKING ONE OF THEBASIC RULES OF POLITICS,
DON'T EAT A BACON SANDWICHIN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS.
THE TORY SUPPORTING PRESSJUMPED ON THE IMAGE,
MILIBAND WAS NOT JUST AFREE-SPENDING LABOURITE, HE
JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE APRIME MINISTER.
>> Jon: THAT'S IT?
HE ATE A BACON SANDWICH.
IN OUR COUNTRY YOU ARE NOTEVEN CONSIDERED A VIABLE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATEUNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN
PHOTOGRAPHED DEEP THROATINGAS MUCH OF A PIG AS WILL NOT
