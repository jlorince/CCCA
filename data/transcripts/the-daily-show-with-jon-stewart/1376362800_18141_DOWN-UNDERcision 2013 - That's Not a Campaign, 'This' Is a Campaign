THEN RUBBING IT ALL OVER HIS
FACE.
(APPLAUSE)
LOOK, AMERICA, AMERICA, LOOK AT
ME.
OUR ELECTIONS DO NOT NEED TO
TAKE AS LONG AS THEY CURRENTLY
DO.
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.
AND THE PROOF OF THAT HAVE IS
RIGHT UNDER YOUR FEET-- THROUGH
SEVERAL LAYERS ACROSS THE MUD,
AUSTRALIA.
>> PRIME MINISTER KEVIN RUDD HAS
PUT AN END TO WEEKS OF
SPECULATION, HE'S CALLED AN
ELECTION FOR SEPTEMBER 7.
>> John: THE WHOLE ELECTION
SEASON IS JUST ONE MONTH LONG.
FOUR WEEKS!
THAT'S LIKE ONLY THREE NEW
IPHONES FROM NOW!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
WE NEED TO LAUNCH OUR FULL
COVERAGE OF DOWN-UNDER-CISION
2013.
(LAUGHTER)
(AS AN AUSTRALIAN)
THAT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN, THIS IS A
CAMPAIGN!
BROUGHT TO YOU BY KOALAS.
KOALAS, LIKE IF TEDDY BEARS WERE
ALIVE AND SURPRISINGLY
AGGRESSIVE.
KOALAS.
AUSTRALIA MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO TEACH US WHEN IT COMES TO
DEMOCRACY STARTING WITH THIS:
>> IN AUSTRALIA, THEY HAVE A
COMPULSORY VOTING SYSTEM SO
EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER
TO VOTE AND TO TURN OUT TO VOTE
AND IF THEY DON'T THEY'RE FINED.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S ILLEGAL
NOT TO VOTE THERE.
THEY SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME
AND ENERGY GETTING PEOPLE TO THE
POLLS RATHER THAN SPENDING TIME,
ENERGY, AND A SUPREME COURT
DECISION PREVENTING THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU MIGHT THINK, "HOLD ON,
JOHN, IF OUR ELECTIONS WERE JUST
FOUR WEEKS WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL
THE FUN OF WATCHING THE HUMAN
GAFFER LAUNCHES ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL."
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S THE THING: YOU'RE WRONG.
NAME A GREAT CAMPAIGN MOMENT AND
AUSTRALIA WILL GET TO IT THIS
MONTH.
AUNT CLUMSY ON-CAMERA PRATTFUL
BY A CANDIDATE?
CHECK.
>> ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE PAST
TIMES DURING CAMPAIGNS IS TO
KISS BABIES AND HE TRIED TO DO
THAT YESTERDAY, HE WENT IN FOR
THE KISS BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE
THE MOTHER TURNED AWAY AND HE
ENDED UP PUTTING HIS LIPS ON THE
BACK OF THE MOTHER'S HEAD.
IT WAS A CRAZY MOMENT.
>> Jon: OH!
YES, YES THAT'S A CREEPY MOMENT.
KISSING THE BACK OF A WOMAN'S
HEAD.
BUT ASK YOURSELF THIS: IS IT
REALLY ANY CREEPIER THAN A
STRANGER PRESSING HIS LIPS
AGAINST THE HEAD OF A
NON-CONSENTING BABY?
BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY SEEMS JUST
AS CREEPY TO ME.
IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL SLIPUPS,
IT'S ALSO VERBAL ATROCITIES.
LIKE RICK PERRY'S INABILITY TO
NAME THE THIRD OF THE THREE
DEPARTMENTS HE WAS GOING TO
ELIMINATE.
WE ALL REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE
WHEN THAT HAPPENED.
I WAS HERE, WATCHING T.V.
THANKING GOD FOR THE EXISTENCE
OF RICK PERRY.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, DON'T WORRY, AUSTRALIA'S
GOT YOU COVERED THERE, TOO.
MEET THE LIBERAL PARTY'S JAYMES
DIAZ AND HIS SIX-POINT PLAN TO
STOP ILLEGAL BOAT IMMIGRATION.
>> WE HAVE A PLAN, A SIX-POINT
PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO
STOP THE BOATS.
>> COULD YOU RUN THROUGH THE SIX
POINTS?
>> WELL, I CAN RUN THROUGH THE
DETAILS OF THE POINTS.
THE MAIN THING IS --
>> THE SIX POINTS.
THE SIX POINTS ARE?
>> WELL -- ONE OF THE POINTS IS
-- THE KEY POINT WILL BE
STOPPING THE BOATS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> John: OF COURSE IT IS!
POINT ONE OF HIS SIX-POINT STOP
THE BOAT PLAN IS NATURALLY STOP
THE BOATS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NOW, LOOK, IN AMERICA -- HERE IN
AMERICA THE REPORTERS PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE LEFT IT THERE
THINKING "JOB DONE, THE MAN HAS
BEEN COMPLETELY HUMILIATED."
IN AUSTRALIA THEY ONLY HAVE ONE
MONTH OF THIS ELECTORAL BUFFET
SO THIS REPORTER-- HOW SHOULD I
PUT IT-- HE TOSSED ANOTHER
QUESTION ON THE BARBIE.
>> WHAT WERE THE OTHER FIVE
POINTS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, LOOK, IT IS UNDER THE
LABOUR PARTY --
>> THE OTHER FIVE POINTS?
>> WELL, I'VE ANSWERED YOUR
QUESTION.
>> YOU'VE SAID STOP THE BOATS.
YOU SAID THERE WAS A SIX POINT
PLAN.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FIVE
POINTS?
>> WELL, WE HAVE A PLAN TO STOP
THE BOATS AND I'VE ANSWERED
THAT.
>> NO OTHER POINTS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> John: HELP HIM!
SOMEBODY HELP HIM!
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU, POINT TWO
IS THIS: HEY, EVERYBODY, OH, MY
GOD, LOOK, A MOUSE RIDING A CAT!
THEN YOU RUN AWAY!
AND IF YOU THINK AUSTRALIA
DOESN'T ALSO MAKE TIME TO THROW
IN A FUN SEXTING SIDESHOW ALLAH
ANTHONY WEINER A.K.A. SENIOR
DANGER.
♪ DANGER, DANGER ♪
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IF YOU THINK, THAT YOU ARE ABOUT
TO BE VERY UNPLEASANTLY
SURPRISED.
>> A QUEENSLAND M.P. CAUGHT UP
IN A SEXTING SCANDAL SENT TEXT
MESSAGES CONTAINING LEWD
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIMSELF TO HIS
MISTRESS INCLUDING ONE OF HIS
PENIS IN A GLASS OF RED WINE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> John: THAT IS DISGUSTING!
YOU DO NOT PAIR A PENIS WITH RED
WINE!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
YOU WANT SOMETHING LIGHTER,
CRISPER TO OFFSET THE NUTTYER
NOTES OF THE PENIS.
(LAUGHTER)
PLUS, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
GET RED WINE STAINS OUT OF A
PENIS.
BELIEVE ME.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO SOAK THAT
THING IN CLUB SODA FOR HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO IN JUST FOUR WEEKS AUSTRALIA
ALREADY HAS A RICK PERRY AND AN
ANTHONY WEINER.
OF COURSE, THE REAL TEST, DOES
IT HAVE A RIGHT WING WOMAN
THRUST INTO A NATIONAL POLITICAL
SPOTLIGHT SHE'S NOT ONLY
UNPREPARED FOR BUT AT TIMES
SEEMS TO BARELY COMPREHEND.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT I'M ASKING IS DOES
AUSTRALIA HAVE A SNARP
>> A MOTHER ACCUSED OF AN
ANTI-MUSLIM CONTAMINATION SCARE
AT A SHOPPING CENTER WILL STAND
AS A ONE NATION CANDIDATE AT
NEXT MONTH'S ELECTION.
>> I DON'T OPPOSE ISLAM AS A
COUNTRY BUT I DO FEEL THAT THEIR
LAWS SHOULD NOT BE WELCOME HERE
IN AUSTRALIA.
LESS THAN 2% OF AUSTRALIANS
FOLLOW HARAM.
>> OR THE KORAN AS THE ISLAMIC
TEXT IS KNOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> John: SHE'S NOT JUST SARAH
PALIN, SHE'S A TURBO PALIN!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WOMAN IS STEPHANIE
BANNISTER, NOT ONLY DOES SHE
THINK ISLAMIC LAW IS CALLED
HARAM WHICH IS A MISUSE OF A
MUSLIM TERM FOR SIMPLE BEHAVIOR,
SHE ALSO THINKS ISLAM IS A
COUNTRY.
PERHAPS IN THE MISTAKEN BELIEF
THAT THE NATION OF ISLAM IS AN
ACTUAL NATION.
(AS AN AUSTRALIAN)
THEY CAN DRESS HOWEVER THEY LIKE
OVER THERE BUT AS AN AUSTRALIAN
I DON'T WANT TO BE FORCED TO
WEAR A BOW TIE.
OR AS WE CALL IN THE AUSTRALIA,
A TWIZZLEY CHOKER.
(LAUGHTER)
BANNISTER HAS SET A NEW
WATERMARK, A NEW LOW WATERMARK
FOR ELECTORAL IGNORANCE.
>> KOSHER FOOD FOR JEWISH
AUSTRALIANS ARE FINE.
>> JEWS UNDER HARAM THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN RELIGION WHICH FOLLOWS
JESUS CHRIST.
>> JUDAISM REJECTS YES US IS
CHRIST.
>> AUSTRALIA, YOU TRULY ARE A
NATION OF CRIMINALS WITHOUT WAS
W THAT MAGNIFICENT SOUNDBITE YOU
JUST STOLE MY HEART!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THAT INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE LAST
WEEK AND THERE'S BEEN AN
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT SINCE
THEN.
>> STEPHANIE BANNISTER HAS NOW
PULLED OUT OF THE RACE.
>> SHE'S LIKE PURE UNCUT PALIN.
SHE QUIT A JOB SHE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE YET!
YOU SEE, THAT IS WHY THE CONCEPT
OF A FOUR-WEEK ELECTION IS SO
ATTRACTIVE.
IT SPEEDS EVERYTHING UP.
WEEK ONE: CANDIDATE ANNOUNCES.
WEEK TWO: SHE SAYS SOMETHING
STUPID.
WEEK THREE: SHE'S SMACKED DOWN
BY THE PRESS.
WEEK FOUR: SHE WITHDRAWS.
WEEK FIVE: THERE IS NO WEEK FIVE
AND NOBODY EVER HEARS FROM HER
EVER AGAIN!
WE CAN HAVE THIS, TOO, AMERICA!
IF WE ALL JUST AGREE NOT TO SAY
ANOTHER (BLEEP)ING WORD ABOUT
THE 2016 ELECTION.
HERE, LOOK, I'VE SET AN ALARM
CLOCK HERE FOR 2016.
WHEN THAT GOES OFF, EVERYONE IS
ALLOWED TO GO NUTS.
UNTIL THEN, PLEASE PRETEND WE
DON'T GIVE A (BLEEP).
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN WE REALLY
DON'T.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
