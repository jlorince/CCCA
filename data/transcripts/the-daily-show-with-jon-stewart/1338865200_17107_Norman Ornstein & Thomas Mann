LCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THEY'VE BEEN POLITICAL RIVALS FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS.
THEIR NEW BOOK IS CALLED IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM THOMAS MANN AND NORMAN ORNSTEIN.
HELLO.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, OUR AUDIENCE LOVES THEIR THINK-TANKERS.
YOU TWO REPRESENT... THIS IS REMARKABLE.
YOU WORK WITH THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE, YES?
>> THAT'S CORRECT Jon: YOU WORK WITH THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE.
THESE ARE THE HATFIELDS AND McCOYS OF THINK TANKS.
YET LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK.
LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE TABLE BUT LOOK AT THIS.
A BOOK.
HOW DID YOU TWO, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE BOTH VERY WELL RESPECKED OBSERVERS OF THE POLITICAL SCENE.
HOW DID YOU TWO START WORKING TOGETHER?
>> WE ACTUALLY STARTED A GRADUATE SCHOOL TOGETHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 45 YEARS AGO.
WE CAME TO WASHINGTON.
WE WORKED ON THE HILL FOR A YEAR AS FELLOWS.
BASICALLY FORMED A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING NOW FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS.
WRITING AND DOING PROJECTS.
>> Jon: THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP TO YOUR PREVIOUS BEST SELLER ABOUT
CONGRESS AND HOW IT... AGAIN I'M PAIR PHRASING WITH MY POLITICAL ANALYST SOCKS.
WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE CONGRESSIONAL DYSFUNCTION IS NOT THE TYPICAL CONGRESSIONAL
FUNCTION THAT WE HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO AND ACCEPT IN OUR DAILY LIVES?
>> IT'S GOTTEN MUCH WORSE.
IT'S NOT JUST THE CONGRESS.
IT'S THE WHOLE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM.
WE HAVE INCENTIVES NOW FOR A POLITICAL PARTY -- IN THIS CASE THE REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION
PARTY -- TO DO WHATEVER IT CAN TO DESTROY THE PRESIDENT, TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCCESSFULLY
PASSING LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT HAVE PROVED TO HIS BENEFIT BECAUSE THEIR ONLY ROUTE TO
POWER IS THAT DEFEAT.
THEREFORE HOLDING THE COUNTRY'S DEBT CEILING HOSTAGE, DENYING THEY WERE SUPPORTING THE HEALTH
CARE PLAN A COUPLE YEARS AGO,
THAT THEY NOW CALL SOCIALISM,
ANYTHING IS OKAY IF IT WORKS TO ACHIEVE THAT END.
>> Jon: YOU WERE WITH THE AEI.
THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOLKS THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
DO YOU STILL HAVE A DESK THERE?
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK IN THREE DAYS, BUT, YES.
I'M A BIT OF AN OUTLIER IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT NOBODY HAS TOLD ME
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
THAT'S BEEN TRUE THROUGHOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WHERE I HAVE OFTEN
SAID SOME THINGS THAT I'M SURE CAUSED SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO WINCE
>> Jon: WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP THOUGH, ISN'T THAT THE ROLE OF
THE OPPOSITION PARTY AND HASN'T IT ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY?
WE ARE THE OPPOSITION PARTY.
THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO, WE WOULD PUT OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF AND KEEP YOU FROM DOING.
WHY IS THIS TIME SO DIFFERENT FROM WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WERE THE OPPOSITION PARTY AND THEY WERE
SAYING THINGS ABOUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION?
>> BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION PARTY THIS TIME IS PREPARED TO GO ALL
OUT TO ACT LIKE A PARLIAMENTARY PARTY REALLY AND OSTENTATIOUS UNRELENTING OPPOSITION USING THE
TOOLS OF THE FILIBUSTER TO DENY THE MAJORITY A CHANCE TO GET THAT PROGRAM PASSED.
WE DON'T HAVE A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM
>> Jon: THIS IS... THESE ARE THE SAME TACTICS AND THE SAME THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE SINCE THE SYSTEM BEGAN BUT THEY ARE BEING DONE NOW WITH A HIGHER VOLUME?
IS THAT IT?
>> A HIGHER VOLUME AND IN A DIFFERENT WAY
>> IT'S NOT LIKE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ANGELS IN THIS PROCESS.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
THEY STOMPED ON HIS NECK.
IF YOU LOOK ALSO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, DEMOCRATS WORKED
WITH HIM AND, YOU KNOW, AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME AFTER THAT HORRIBLE 2000 ELECTION BASICALLY
GAVE HIM LEGITIMACY BY SUPPORTING THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND BILL.
DEMOCRATIC VOTES GAVE HIM THE TAX CUTS FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
THEY WORKED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN A LOT OF PLACES EVEN AS WE HAD PARTISANSHIP.
NOW THE PROBLEM SOLVERS ARE GONE.
IT'S FAR MORE TRUE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
THERE ARE SOME OF THEM THERE BUT THEY DON'T VOTE THAT WAY.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
>> Jon: WHY SHOULDN'T THEY DO THAT THOUGH BECAUSE IF I UNDERSTAND THE PLATFORM
CORRECTLY, THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM IS GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE HELPFUL IN SOLVING PROBLEMS SO
WATCH AS I DEMONSTRATE.
ISN'T THAT... AREN'T THEY DOING WHAT THEY ARE... WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO DO.
THEY'VE BEEN ELECTED TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND DISMANTLE IT.
AND THE METHOD THAT THEY ARE DOING IT IS THROUGH THIS OBSTRUCTIONISM OR...
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT WHO IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESULTS?
IT'S NOT THE REPUBLICANS IN THE MINORITY IN CONGRESS OR EVEN CONTROLLING THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.
IT'S THE PRESIDENT.
SO THEY CALL BACK AT HIM, YOUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN ENTIRELY UNSUCCESSFUL.
LET ME TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL BECAUSE IN A WAY WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS LIKE POLISHING THAT TURD.
>> Jon: MAY I SAY SOMETHING?
YOU SEE THAT PHRASE COME OUT OF A LEARNED MAN'S MOUTH, IN SOME WAYS I CONSIDER MYSELF JUST
HAVING GONE THROUGH A DOCTORAL PROGRAM.
GO AHEAD.
POLISH THAT TURD
>> YOU MAY WANT TO DISMANTLE GOVERNMENT.
THEY'RE SAYING, YOU KNOW, IF BE COOPERATE WITH THEM IT ONLY GETS BIGGER.
THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT.
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO REDUCE DEFICITS BY CUTTING TAXES AND YET STILL
SUPPORTING FUNDAMENTALLY MUCH OF GOVERNMENT.
IF YOU BRING THE U.S. CREDIT RATING DOWN BECAUSE YOU, FOR THE FIRST TIME, HOLD THE DEBT
CEILING HOSTAGE TO A SET OF NONNEGOTIABLE DEMANDS, THAT'S NOT DOING, I THINK, WHAT THEIR
CONSTITUENTS WANT OR WHAT THEY'RE ELECTED TO DO.
IT'S A DIFFERENT PHENOMENON THAN WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.
YOU CAN BE CONSERVATIVE AND YET STILL WORK TO SOLVE PROBLEM
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY
IS MAYBE BOTH SIDES HAVE GOTTEN TOO MUCH OF WHAT THEY WANT AS PART OF THIS.
IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
THOMAS MANN AND NORMAN ORNSTEIN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
