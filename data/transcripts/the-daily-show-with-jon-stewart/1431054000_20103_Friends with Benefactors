MONTAGE.
>> MONEY IS SPEECH.
THEY'RE PUTTING ISSUES ON THETABLE AND THE AMERICAN VOTERS
GET TO DECIDE.
>> ALL OF THE MONEY THAT THEY'RECONCERNED ABOUT IS THE CORE KIND
OF POLITICAL SPEECH THAT THEFIRST AMENDMENT
WAS INTENDED TOPROTECT.
>> DEMOCRATS ARE NOW PUSHING TOAMEND THE U.S. CONSTITUTION TO
MAKE IT TOUGHER TO SPEND ONPOLITICAL CAMPAIGNS,
IT'S BASICALLY AN ATTEMPT TOLIMIT THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

STOP THAT QUOTE CORRUPTION.

CORRUPTION, NOT"CORRUPTION."
BUT, LET'S RECAP. HOW DO WE FEELABOUT FOREIGN MONEY?

YOU KNOW, JUST FOR THE SAKE OFWRAPPING UP OUR ARGUMENT HERE,
I'M GOING TO THROW IN OPTION AAS WELL.
THIS IS ABOUT HOW DOMESTIC MONEYWE CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE THERE IS
CORRUPTION.
REMEMBER HOW ODD IT WAS LASTYEAR WHEN CHRIS CHRISTIE VETOED
A MEASURE THAT WOULD HAVE BANNED THE USE OF HOG GESTATION
CRATES EVEN THOUGH IT HADOVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
OF THE STATE SENATE, THESTATE ASSEMBLY AND THE
CITIZENS OF NEW JERSEY, WHICH BYTHE WAY IS AN ALMOST ENTIRELY
PIGLESS STATE.
WHY WOULD CHRIS CHRISTIE CARE?
WHILE EITHER HE JUST FEELS INHIS HEART THAT PIGS HAVE
HAD A FREE RIDE FOR TOO LONGAND SHOULD LIVE IN GESTATION
CRATES WHERE THEY ARE NOT ABLETO TURN AROUND
OR HE WAS DOING THE BIDDING OFGOP MEGA-DONOR AND CHRISTIE
2012 BACKER IOWAN BRUCERASTETTER WHO HAPPENED TO
BE ONE OF THE AMERICAN'S TOP HOGPRODUCERS AND WHAT'S MORE
RASTETTER'S BROTHER JUST HAPPENSTO BE C.E.O. OF A COMPANY
THAT BUILDS GESTATION CRATES ANDWHAT'S MORE, CHRISTIE WAS AT
RASTETTER'S 2016 PRESIDENTIALFORUM AUDITIONING
FOR THIS YEAR'S MONEY.
NOW CAN WE PROVE THAT CHRISTIEVETOED THE BILL TO PLEASE HIS
WEALTHY FRIENDS?
NO. BUT --
>> THE QUESTION REMAINS TO WHOMDOES --
>> CHRISTIE>> OWE FAVORS BECAUSE
OF THE -->> HOG MONEY.

>> Jon: IT'S AT TIMES, IT'S ATTIMES LIKE THIS AS WE BEGIN WHAT
IS PROJECTED TO BE A $10 BILLIONPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SEASON,
WITH BILLIONAIRES BUYING UPCANDIDATES LIKE BITCOINS,
THAT I'M THANKFUL THAT WEHAVE THE FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION -- OR FEC.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT THE FEC, IS NOT A GREAT
ACRONYM.
A BIPARTISAN GOVERNMENT AGENCYFORMED AFTER WATERGATE
SPECIFICALLY TASKED TO ENFORCECAMPAIGN SPENDING REGULATIONS.
GO GET 'EM FEC.
>> THE FEDERAL ELECTIONCOMMISSION CHAIR SAYS SHE'S DONE
TRYING TO TAKE ACTION AGAINSTMAJOR VIOLATIONS.

ANN RAVEL SAID SHE'S GIVINGUP HOPE ON REGULATING MONEY
ABUSE DURING THIS PRESIDENTIALELECTION.
