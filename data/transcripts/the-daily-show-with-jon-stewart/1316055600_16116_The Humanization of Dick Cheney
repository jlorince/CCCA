[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS... MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE'RE
EXCITED, RAPPER, WHITE HOUSE
POETRY NIGHT GUST, ACTOR,
DESTROYER OF CIVILIZATIONS.
COMMON WILL BE JOINING US ON THE
PROGRAM TONIGHT.
BUT FIRST, AS YOU'LL RECALL,
DURING HIS TIME AS AN ELECTED
OFFICIAL ACCOUNTABLE TO THE
NATION'S VOTERS, OUR VICE
PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY KEPT
SOMETHING OF A LOW PROFILE.
[LAUGHTER]
STAYING IN UNDISCLOSED
LOCATIONS, ERASING THE VICE
PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE FROM
GOOGLE MAPS, TRAVELING ONLY A
NIGHT ON THE NEW MOON AT LOW
TIDE.
BUT WITH THE RELEASE LAST MONTH
OF HIS NEW TELL-SOME BOOK,
CHENEY IS NOW SAYING, HELLO,
WORLD, IT'S ME, DICK.
HE'S ON "DATELINE," THE "TODAY
SHOW," MORNING SHOW, EVERY SHOW
FOLK NEWS HAS EVER PRODUCED,
INCLUDING A DOUBLE SHOT OF
HANNITY, "THE SITUATION ROOM,"
ABC NEWS, C-SPAN AND EVEN THE
THE UNSHOW, WHERE THINGS GOT
SOMEWHAT SURREAL.
>> It's "The Tonight Show with
Jay Leno."
Tonight Jay welcomes former vice
president Dick Cheney.
Carrot top.
OH, MMM, OH, OH, HOLD ON.
SIX LEGS, TWO HEARTS AND A
PENDING INDICTMENT FOR WAR
CRIMES AT THE HAGUE.
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM.
NAME THREE THINGS THAT THE
TONIGHT SHOW PANEL POSSESSIONS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHY CARSON WAS THE
GREATEST.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A HARD ONE TO
EXPLAIN TO THE ALIENS WHO VISIT
THIS EARTH.
BUT, OF COURSE, FOR ME THE
HIGHLIGHT OF CHENEY'S TOUR BEGAN
YESTERDAY WHEN HE, ALONG WITH
HIS WIFE LYNN, DROPPED IN ON THE
LADIES OF THE VIEW.
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS LITTLE BULGE
HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I'M GUESSING THAT LINE
WAS ESPECIALLY UNSETTLING ON
"THE VIEW'S" RADIOBROADCAST.
>> LAST YEAR AGO JUNE, I WENT
INTO END-STAGE HEART FAILURE.
IN EFFECT MY HEART WASN'T
PUMPING ENOUGH BLOOD TO SURFACE
MY ORGAN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: GO ON.
>> THIS IS THE CONTROL ELEMENT
THAT RUNS IT.
THE ACTUAL PUMP ITSELF IS INSIDE
MY CHEST.
YOU NEED POWER ALL THE TIME, 24
HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.
[BEEPING]
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> PUT THE BATTERY BACK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: CHENEY'S FRAILTY
SAPPING MY ABILITY TO POKE FUN
AT HIS VILE PUBLIC SERVICE
RECORD.
I... BUT WHY?
>> HE'S MORE MACHINE NOW THAN
MAN.
>> YES, YES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S WHY.
THAT'S WHAT IS SAPPING MY
ABILITY TO POKE FUN AT HIM,
GHOST OF ALEC GUINNESS, IT'S
THAT THE DARTH VADER METAPHOR IS
NOW MORE TRUE THAN FUNNY.
I... THIS IS REALLY
UNBELIEVABLE.
IT TOOK A PIECE OF BIONIC
MACHINERY TO HUMANIZE DICK
CHENEY.
