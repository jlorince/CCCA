THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
ON TO OUR TOP STORY.
OUR TOP STORY FOR THE NIGHT.
REMEMBER LAST MONTH, TEXAS STATE
SENATOR WENDY DAVIS STOOD FOR
TEN HOURS IN PINK SNEAKERS TO
PROTEST HER STATE'S PROPOSED
ABORTION RESTRICTIONS.
VERY DRAMATIC.
VERY DRAMATIC.
VERY INSPIRING.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OF COURSE, IN THE END IT WAS FOR
NOTHING SINCE THE LAW PASSED A
FEW DAYS AGO, SWEEPING AWAY HER
HERCULEAN EFFORT LIKE A TUMBLE
WEED TURNED ABANDONED ABORTION
CLINIC.
BUT WHAT IT DID DO WAS FOCUS
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION ON ONE OF
OUR DEMOCRACY'S QUIRKIEST
FEATURES, THE PHILADELPHIA PHILADELPHIA
FILIBUSTER WHICH AT THE FEDERAL
LEVEL IS MORE POPULAR THAN EVER.
>> UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE
HAVE BEEN 16 FILIBUSTERS ON HIS
NOMINATIONS OF HIS OWN TEAM,
CABINET SECRETARIES VERSUS 20 IN
THE ENTIRE HISTORY BEFORE.
>> ZERO FOR EISENHOWER TO FORD.
CARTER AND REAGAN HAD TWO EACH
ON EXECUTIVE NOMINEES.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENT
OBAMA, YOU MADE THIS POINT, 16
FOR HIS FIRST TERM.
28 PROJECTEDDED THIS TERM.
>> John: WOW.
SO NEARLY HALF OF ALL EXECUTIVE
NOMINEE FILIBUSTERS EVER HAVE
BEEN TO BLOCK OBAMA APPOINTEES.
I'VE GOT TO SAY WHEN THEY TOLD
US THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN
HISTORIC PRESIDENCY, I DON'T
THINK THIS WAS REALLY WHAT
EVERYONE HAD IN MIND.
NOW, THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR
THIS.
ONE, CONGRESS' ENATE
DICKISHNESS.
YOU CAN'T EACH THAT.
TWO UNDER OPPORTUNITY RULES ALL
YOU NEED TO DO TO FILIBUSTER IS
SAYING, "I'M GOING TO
FILIBUSTER."
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND THERE
FOR 15 HOURS, HOLD YOUR PEE,
READ THE PHONE BOOK.
IT'S LIKE A GOLFER STANDING AT A
TEE AND TURNING TO HIS CADDY AND
SAYING I PLAN TO HIT A HOLE IN
ONE.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT ME DOWN
FOR A ONE.
IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE IN BAR
HIGH FIVING.
NOW THIS CURRENT RIDICULOUS
SITUATION HAS PROVEN A LITTLE
TOO MUCH FOR SOME PEOPLE.
>> SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE
PREPARING TO CHANGE FILIBUSTER,
INVOKING THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR
OPTION.
>> John: NO, NO, NOT THE NUCLEAR
OPTION.
EVERYBODY, DUCK AND COVER.
>> INVOKING THE SO MUCH CALLED
NUCLEAR OPTION TO CHANGE SENATE
RULES SO THAT ONLY A SIMPLE
MAJORITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO
CONFIRM NOMINEES FOR FEDERAL
AGENCIES' CABINET APPOINTMENTS.
>> John: HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
SO IN THIS CONTEXT, THE NUCLEAR
OPTION IS JUST A SIMPLE CHANGE
IN PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.
THAT IS THE WORLD'S WORST JERRY
BRUCKHEIMER MOVIE.
HEY, I'VE COME HERE TO CHEW
BUBBLE GUM AND TO CONFIRM SUB
CABINET LEVEL NOMINEES.
GUESS WHAT?
I'M ALL OUT OF BUBBLE GUM.
(LAUGHING) DID THAT LOOK AS
UNCOOL AS IT FELT?
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT IT IS A
YES.
IF THEY'RE CALLING IT A NUCLEAR
OPTION, THEY MUST BE TAKING THIS
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.
SENATE LEADER HARRY REID, CAN
YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS MIGHT BE
NECESSARY PERHAPS WITH A BRIEF
ANALOGY.
>> DAVEY JOHNSON IS A MANAGER OF
THE NATIONAL METS, THE TEAM
WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE HERE IN
WASHINGTON.
HE'S HERE AS MANAGER.
NOW IMAGINE THE FRONT OFFICE OF
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL CALLING UP
DAVEY JOHNSON AROUND THE FIRST
OF APRIL AND SAID, DAVEY, I KNOW
THAT... I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU
CAN PLAY HIM AS SOON AS THE ALL
STAR BREAK IS OVER.
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT REPUBLICANS
ARE SAYING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR TEAM UNTIL
WE TELL YOU EVERYTHING IS JUST
FINE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US A LONG
TIME FOR US TO TELL YOU THAT.
>> John: YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE
THAT WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO DELAY
AN ORGASM, THEY WOULD THINK OF
BASEBALL.
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU HAVE A
MUCH BETTER OPTION.
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HARRY REID
TALKING' BASEBALL.
... TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL.
THAT WON'T JUST DELAY YOUR
ORGASM, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN
ORGASM EVER AGAIN.
IT'S THE WORLD'S MOST BORING MAN
IN THE WORLD'S MOST BORING PLACE
DISCUSSING THE WORLD'S MOST
BORING SPORT.
IT'S LIKE AN AMBIEN STUFFED
INSIDE A LUNESTA COVERED BY A
BOTTLE OF NIQUIL.
IT'S A SNORE-DUCKEN, IF YOU
WILL.
NOW, THIS IS ACTUALLY A DANCE AS
OLD AS TIME BECAUSE THE MAJORITY
PARTY WANTS TO GET RID OF THE
FILIBUSTER WHEREAS THE OTHER
PARTY -- LET'S CALL THEM THE
MINORITY -- FIGHTS THEM TOOTH
AND NAIL WHICH MEANS HARRY REID
AND THE SENIOR SENATORS FROM
KENTUCKY ARE ABOUT TO ENGAGE
INTO AN ULTIMATE AGE FIGHTING.
>> THIS ISN'T A POWER GRAB.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT A POWER GRAB
LOOKS LIKE.
>> NO MATTER HOW OFTEN MY FRIEND
RUDELY TALKS ABOUT ME NOT
BREAKING MY WORD, I'M NOT GOING
TO RESPOND TALKING ABOUT HOW
MANY TIMES HE'S BROKEN HIS WORD.
>> WE DON'T PULL BACK FROM THE
BRINK HERE, MY FRIEND THE
MAJORITY LEADER IS GOING TO BE
REMEMBERED AS THE WORST LEADER
OF THE SENATE EVER.
>> John: OWE, THE WORST EVER.
McCONNELL HAS REED ON THE
ROPES.
FINISH HIM.
>> SENATOR McCONNELL'S
CAMPAIGN TWEETED OUT THIS NET
OWE OF A TOMBSTONE WITH THE LINE
"IF REED CHANGES THE RULES TO
KILL THE FILIBUSTER, KILL THE
SENATE WILL BE ON HIS
TOMBSTONE."
>> John: McCONNELL WINS.
