[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS PROFESSORAND CHAIR OF THE REGIONAL
STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT NATIONALDEFENSE UNIVERSITY.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THETALIBAN REVIVAL: VIOLENCE AND
EXTREMISM ON THEPAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN FRONTIER.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMHASSAN ABBAS.
HELLO, SIR.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE TALIBANREVIVAL."
I THINK IT MUST HAVE OBVIOUSLYBEEN PRINTED IN ERROR BECAUSE
I'M PRETTY SURE WE TOOK CARE OFTHESE GUYS.
I'M PRETTY SURE WE WENT TOAFGHANISTAN.
SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY DONE NOW.
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONE.
>> WE THOUGHT SO.
THAT WAS WHAT WE THOUGHT SHOULDHAVE HAPPENED...
>> Jon: YES.>> BUT THAT'S NOT THE STORY.
WE THOUGHT THAT AFTER THE 9/11TRAGEDY AND THE WAY THE U.S.
FORCES WENT IN THAT WE WOULDGO AND JUST THROUGH BOMBING
AND JUST THROUGH MILITARYKINETIC ACTION, WHICH WAS
IMPORTANT, BUT THERE WAS MORESPACE THAT THEY HAD GAINED.
THEY HAD MORE POWER, AND THEYHAD MORE IDEAS THAT WE NEVER
THOUGHT WOULD BE THERE.
>> Jon: BUT WE ALSO... YOU KNOW,WE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME IN
A SORT OF HEARTS AND MINDS,NATION-BUILDING MODE, AS WELL.
I MEAN, IN AFGHANISTAN, IN IRAQ,TEN YEARS, 12 YEARS, 14 YEARS,
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
HAS THAT BEEN FOR NAUGHT?
>> NO.
THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANTCONTRIBUTION, BUT IN SOME CASES
WE THOUGHT WE'D BE ABLE TO ATTIMES MICROMANAGE.
WE ALSO THOUGHT, AND WHEN I SAY"WE," THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, WE THOUGHT THAT WECOULD JUST INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF
DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM ANDLIBERTY AND THE OTHERS WOULD BE
WILLING TO TAKE IT.
THEY WERE GOING THROUGH ATERRIBLE PHASE OF WAR FOR TWO OR
THREE DECADES.
AND WE WENT ONLY FOR ENHANCINGTHEIR CAPABILITY TO FIGHT
TERRORISM THROUGH KINETIC MEANS.FOR INSTANCE, IT WAS A LATE
THOUGHT, IT WAS QUITE LATEIN THE GAME THAT WE THOUGHT THAT
AFGHANISTAN NEEDS POLICE ASWELL, THE CIVILIAN LAW
ENFORCEMENT INFRASTRUCTURES,BECAUSE CIVILIAN POLICING IS
LINKED TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICESYSTEM.
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ISLINKED TO THE RULE OF LAW.
THE RULE OF LAW IS LINKED TODEMOCRACY.
THERE'S NO SHORT WAY OR SHORTCUTTO THIS.
SO WE WANTED TO DO WELL.
I TEACH U.S. OFFICERS WHO HAVESERVED IN THAT AREA.
I SALUTE THEM, THEIR DEDICATIONAND COMMITMENT.
BUT IN TERMS OF POLICY, WENEEDED A MUCH MORE
COMPREHENSIVE, WELL-THOUGHT-OUTPROCESS ABOUT EDUCATION, ABOUT
AWARENESS. SO WEHAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD,
BUT TO REALLY TACKLE THIS KINDOF EXTREMISM THAT WE ARE SEEING
IN AFGHANISTAN STILL AND INIRAQ IN THE SHAPE OF ISIS,
THAT REQUIRES A VERY, ITHINK, A MORE COMPREHENSIVE
STRATEGY, INTERNALLY AS WELL ASEXTERNALLY.
>> Jon: BUT IT DOESN'T, YOUKNOW, BY ALL INDICATIONS, THESE
GROUPS, THE TALIBAN, FORWHATEVER THEIR POWER IS,
FOR WHATEVER THEIR REVIVAL,ISIS, THE TALIBAN, THEY DON'T
SEEM TO ENJOY HUGE POPULARSUPPORT AMONGST THE PEOPLE.
THEY SEEM TO RULE THROUGH FEARAND THROUGH VICIOUSNESS AND
DEPRAVITY.
I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLETHERE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE
TO LEAD THEIR LIVES.
IT DOESN'T APPEAR SO.
HOW DO YOU FOCUS ON THAT?
>> THAT IS TRUE.
AND THEY HAVE DEVISED GOOD WAYSTO MANAGE THIS.
FOR INSTANCE, THE VERY IDEA OFAL QAEDA, IT WAS NOT ABOUT FOOT
SOLDIERS AND A POLITICAL PARTY.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THIS WAS A FEW PEOPLE HADSOME IDEAS BASED ON DISTORTION
OF ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES.
BUT THEN THEY KNEW HOW TO CREATEFEAR. THE WHOLE POLICY,
THE WHOLE VIEW AND THEORY ABOUTTERROR TACTICS, THAT IS TO
OPPRESS, THAT IS TO CONTROL,MANIPULATE, BLACKMAIL.
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE BEENGOOD AT, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO
SEEM IN MY WAY, AS I WOULDSAY WEARING MY HAT, MY RELIGIOUS
IDENTITY, TO SEE THE KIND OF...TO SEE CHALLENGE TO THIS FROM
WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY,WHICH HAS HAPPENED.
AT TIMES WE FORGET ABOUT IT.
AT TIMES WE IGNORE IT.
AT TIMES IT DOESN'T FIT INTO OURMODEL.
BUT THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITHTHE DEGENERATION OF RELIGIOUS
AND POLITICAL HEART, IF I MAYCALL IT THAT,
HAS ALSO BEEN VERY SEVERE.THIS SCOURGE OF
SECTARIANISM, THIS KIND OFBIGOTRY AND RELIGIOUS ZEAL, THAT
THEN ENABLES THESE THUGS
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS TODO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
I'M SAYING THAT FOR ANYSUSTAINABLE CHANGE,
YOU HAVE TO FOR INSTNACEPICK PARTNERS FROM THE OUTSIDE
IN IRAQ OR IN AFGHANISTAN, PICKPARTNERS WHO NOT WOULD LOOK
AT THEM AS IDENTICAL OF OURS ANDMIDDLE.
WE NEED PARTNERS WHO HAVECREDIBILITY...
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> WHO HAVE SOME
LEVEL OF RESPECT, AND THEYCHALLENGE THEM.
>> Jon: BUT, THIS IS ANINTERESTING POINT THAT YOU
BRING UP, AND IT'S THE ONE THATI CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND:
WHY IS IT THE UNITED STATES?
WHY CAN'T SAUDI, UAE, ALL OFTHESE GROUPS THAT HAVE MORE
CREDIBILITY IN THAT REGION ANDCERTAINLY IN THE SUNNI WORLD,
WHY CAN'T THEY TAKE THE LEAD INTHIS TYPE OF THING AND DO WHAT
YOU SAY?
MY ASSESSMENT IS THATAUTHORITARIANISM IS AS BAD AS
TERRORISM.
IN SOME OF THESE CASES, I'LL NOTNAME ANY COUNTRIES, BUT THE KIND
OF BIGOTRY THAT WE SEE HAS BEENINSTITUTIONALIZED IN SOME OF
THESE CASES.
FOR US FROM OUTSIDE, WE MUST SEETHE KIND OF INJUSTICES,
OPPRESSION SOME OF THEMINORITIES WITHIN THE MUSLIM
AND NON-MUSLIMS WHO AREFACING ALL THESE CHALLENGES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT THEY REQUIRE ADIFFERENT, DISPASSIONATE LOOK.
IT HAS TO BE MUCH MORECOMPREHENSIVE, AND I'M USING THE
WORD "COMPREHENSIVE" AGAINBECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT
HAPPENING.
>> Jon: BUT THEN IT'S A WORLDJOB. IF THIS IS A REGION
TRAPPED BETWEEN AUTOCRACY ANDEXTREMISM, THEN IT'S THE JOB,
I JUST THINK IT'S TOO BIG A JOBFOR ONE COUNTRY.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND? WE'LL GOTO COMERCIAL.
YOU'LL STICK AROUND ANDYOU'LL TELL US HOW TO DO IT.
>> I WOULD LOVE TO.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO GIVEAWAY THE ENDING OF THE BOOK, BUT
DO WE WIN?
>> WE WILL. WE WILL.
>> Jon: "THE TALIBAN REVIVAL" ISON THE BOOKS SHELVES NOW.
HASSAN ABBAS, THANK YOU.
