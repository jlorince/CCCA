>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM.
AS WE JUST SAW IN THE FIRST
ACT, THE NATION CLEARLY IS IN
DIRE STRAITS WITH REGARDS TO
THE DEBT CEILING CRISIS.
FOR MORE ON ITS POSSIBLE
IMPACT WE'RE JOINED BY THE
DAILY SHOW'S SENIOR ECONOMIST
JASON JONES.
JASON, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
.
JASON, IF THE EXPERTS ARE TO
BE BELIEVED, INACTION ON THE
DEBT CEILING AND DEFICIT
REDUCTION WOULD BE
CATASTROPHIC.
BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE THUS
FAR SEEMINGLY BROUGHT OUT THE
WORST IN OUR POLITICAL AND
PUNDIT CLASS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND IF THE CONVERSATION
CONTINUES THIS WAY, WE COULD
VERY WELL HIT THE NATIONAL
BULL (BEEP) CEILING.
>> Jon: THAT WOULD BE
CATASTROPHIC.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AS YOU KNOW, JON, THE NATIONAL
BULL (BEEP) CEILING OR TO PUT
IT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS THE
AMOUNT OF BULL (BEEP) PEOPLE
ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO TAKE
HAS BEEN FREEZING UP.
>> Jon: WHERE ARE WE WITH THE
BULL (BEEP) CEILING RIGHT NOW?
>> RIGHT NOW AMERICANS HAVE
PRETTY MUCH HAD IT UP TO ABOUT
HERE WITH THIS BULL (BEEP).
BY THE END OF THIS MONTH IT
SEEMS LIKELY WE'LL HAVE HAD IT
UP TO HERE.
BULL WOOEPWISE.
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED WE
DON'T HAVE POOH-GILLS.
>> Jon: WHAT WOULD THE
RAMIFICATION OF THAT BE?
>> HISTORICALLY THE BALANCE IN
OUR COUNTRY COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MONEY TALKS AND BULL
(BEEP) WALKS BUT THIS RECENT
SURGE HAS SO BLOATED BULL
(BEEP) IT IS NO LONGER
AMBULATORY.
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRIAN MUST BE
ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE.
>> Jon: WILLIAM JENNINGS BRIAN,
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO WITH
IT?
>> AS YOU KNOW HE WAS ONE OF
THE EARLIEST CRUSADERS AGAINST
(BEEP)-FLATION.
HIS FAMOUS 1896 SPEECH YOU
WILL NOT CRUCIFY MANKIND UPON
A CROSS OF POOP.
AS YOU KNOW JENNINGS NEVER
WORE BLUE.
>> Jon: CLEARLY A COUPLE OF
HISTORY MAJORS LAUGHED AT
THAT.
ANYWAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M
VERY IMPRESSED.
YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR BULL
(BEEP).
>> WELL, GOT A B.A.IN B.S.
>> Jon: WHERE DID YOU GO TO
SCHOOL?
BROWN?
>> VERY MATURE.
VERY MATURE, JON.
YOU KNOW VERY WELL I WENT TO
ANAL ROBERTS UNIVERSITY.
>> Jon: SO....
>> A GOOD SCHOOL.
>> Jon: SO FIGHTIN' FISHERS.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE CLOSE TO
HITTING THE BULL (BEEP)
CEILING.
WHY SHOULD WE WORRY.
>> JON, IF WE REACH THE POINT
WHERE THE AMOUNT OF BULL
(BEEP) EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF
ACTUAL THINGS, WE WILL
EFFECTIVELY DEFAULT ON
REALITY.
IT'S ALREADY STARTED
HAPPENING.
>> IF YOU WANT AN ABORTION YOU
GO TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
THAT'S WELL OVER 90% OF WHAT
PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOES.
>> WE DID CALL HIS OFFICE
TRYING TO ASK WHAT HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT THERE.
I JUST WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU
VERBATIM HERE.
I SAYS HIS REMARK WAS NOT
INTENDED TO BE A FACTUAL
STATEMENT.
>> DID YOU SEE THAT?
WHEN JON KYL GOT CALLED ON
BUSINESS BULL (BEEP) RESPONSE
WAS TO GET ANGRY AT PEOPLE TO
EXPECT SOMETHING OTHER THAN
BULL (BEEP).
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: JASON, WHY CAN'T WE
JUST IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS,
WHY CAN'T WE JUST RAISE THE
BULL (BEEP) KREEL SOMETHING.
>> JON, THIS ISN'T AN
ARBITRARY FIGURE LIKE THE DEBT
CEILING.
THIS IS REAL.
AND IF WE CAN'T CUT THE BULL
(BEEP), THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE
SOLUTION.
WE AS A NATION NEED TO START
REPLACING (BEEP) WITH FARTS
FROM OUR BUTT.
>> Jon: COME ON, JASON.
>> FACTUAL ASSESS MANYS OF
REALITY-BASED TRUTHS OR FARTS.
WE NEED POLITICIANS AND
JOURNALISTS WILLING TO CALL
BULL (BEEP) ON THE BULL
(BEEP).
>> Jon: BUT YOU SAID THE FARTS
WOULD COME FROM OUR BUTT.
>> YES.
BOLD, UNCOMPROMISING TRUTH
TELLING.
BUTT.
WHY, WHAT DID YOU?
OH, FARTS FROM OUR BUTT.
JON, GROW UP.
