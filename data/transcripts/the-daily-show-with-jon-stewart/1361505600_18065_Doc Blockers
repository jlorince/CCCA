>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
JOURNALIST STEPHEN BRISM HE IS THE AUTHOR OF ATIME MAGAZINE COVER STORY ON WHAT SAILING OUR
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
IT TURNS OUT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS PRICE CANCER AND NO INSURANCE.
[LAUGHTER]
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS WEEK ON THE PROGRAM HOW REPUBLICANS LED BY SENATORS LINDSEY GRAHAM
AND SALTY McCAIN ARE HOLDING UP THE NOMINEES FOR THE DEFENSE AND C.I.A. UNTIL THE SENATORS
GET THE INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI INCLUDING WHO CHANGED THE TALKING POINTS
SUSAN RICE USED ON THE SUNDAY MORNING SHOWS SO WE CAN BE SURE NO AMERICANS ARE HARMED AGAIN BY
THE TALKING POINTS.
>> WHATEVER WAS SAID BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ON A
SERIES OF SUNDAY SHOWS BEARS NO RELEVANCE ON THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI.
THERE'S AN OBVIOUS POLITICAL OBSESSION OVER A SERIES OF TALK POINTS THAT AGAIN BEARS NO
RELEVANCE ON THE ESSENTIAL ISSUES HERE.
>> JUST A LOT OF PAUSES.
VERY QUICKLY.
THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT.
THEY ARE NOT RELEVANT.
THEY ARE NOT GERMANE.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM ANYWAY BUT LATELY THERE'S AN INTERESTING TWIST.
SOME DEMOCRATS APPARENTLY DECIDING -- DEMOCRATS DECIDING THAT WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE
PHRASE I'M LOOKING FOR?
>> WHAT IS SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE IS NOW SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
>> Jon: NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
I'M THINKING OF THE OTHER POULTRY BASED EXPRESSION.
>> KEEP (bleep) THAT CHICKEN.
>> Jon: KEEP (bleep) THAT CHICKEN.
THAT'S THE ONE.
[LAUGHTER]
DEMOCRATS SAW REPUBLICANS (bleep) THAT CHICKEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEY THOUGHT I WANT TO GET ME SOME OF THAT.
>> IT'S SOME IN THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY THAT ARE THREATENING TO HOLD UP BRENNAN'S NOMINATION.
OREGON SENATOR RON WYDEN TELLING REPORTERS HE WOULD PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS TO GET ANSWERS ABOUT
THE LEGALITY OF AMERICANS TARGETED BY AL QAEDA OVERSEAS.
>> Jon: OOOH THE SENATOR FROM OREGON IS GOING TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS.
SOMEONE IS GOING GET A LETTER ON ARTISNAL HEMP -- DAM YOU SOY INK.
FREE RANGE PENS?
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> THEY'VE WRITTEN SAY FUG DON'T SHARE WITH US SOME OF THE LEGAL MEMOS DRAFTED BY THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE TOLL VALID DATE THE DRONE KILLING OF AMERICAN CITIZENS OVERSEAS WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR JOHN BRENNAN.
>> Jon: THAT'S A WISEGUY LIKE.
NICE NOMINEE YOU GOT THERE BE A SHAME IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM, MR. PRESIDENT.
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO REMIND DEMOCRATS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A DRONE PROGRAM
WITH AMBIGUOUS RESTRAINTS AND MURKY LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.
THIS IS ALL FOR NAUGHT.
I'M SURE HE WILL SHARE THE DRONE E-MAILS.
HE PRETTY MUCH SAID SO A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.
>> IN THE MONTHS AHEAD I'LL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE CONGRESS TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT OUR
TARGETING, DETENTION AND PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LAWS
AND SYSTEM OF CHECK AND BALANCES BUT THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE MORE TRANSPARENT TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD.
>> Jon: STARTING WITH OUR NUCLEAR CODES.
4-13-8 -- NOW, SOME AMERICANS WANT TO CHANGE THE CODES.
HE WILL BE ASKED THE SECURITY QUESTION WHAT HOSPITAL WERE YOU BORN IN?
