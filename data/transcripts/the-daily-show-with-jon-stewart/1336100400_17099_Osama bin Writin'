>> Jon: SAY, HELL WOMAN TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GREAT SHOW, PETER BERGEN,
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK MANHUNT.
I KNOW BHAU ARE THINKING,
ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT SO YOU CAN SAY ABBOTTABAD, I KNOW.
I'M SURE IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION.
LEV LAUGH.
>> Jon: AS YOU KNOW OSAMA BIN LADEN HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS THIS BEING THE
ONIER AN VERSE AR OF HIS PASSING.
>> GOOD MORNING, WE ARE GETTING A BRAND-NEW LOOK INTO THE MIND OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.
PARTS OF BIN LADEN'S PERSONAL LETTERS NABBED FROM HIS COMPOUND IN PAKISTAN BY
NAVY SEALS HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED.
>> Jon: WHOOO!
PERSONAL LETTERS.
OF BIN LADEN.
DEAR WIFE NUMBER 7.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HOW IS SON NUMBER 19?
I MISS YOU.
TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE WEARING?
OVER YOUR FACE.
LAUGH LAUGH COME ON, THE GUY WAS RUN ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST FEERDZ TERRORIST NETWORK.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HE HAD A LOT OF TIME TO KEEP UP WITH CORRESPONDENT.
>> NBC NEWS HAS BEEN TOLD BY SENIOR OFFICIALS THAT THERE WERE AS MANY AS 15,000
DISTINCT INDIVIDUAL DOCUMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN FROM THAT COMPOUND WHEN BIN LADEN WAS KILLED BY NAVY SEALS.
>> Jon: 15,000, THE GUY WASN'T A TERRORIST, HE WAS A HOARDER, OH MY GOD.
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO KIM THIS GUY.
IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL WE LEARNED HE DIED ALONE SURROUND BY 29 CATS.
TWO DECADES WORTH OF JC PENNEY CATALOGS.
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DID WE GET, WHAT NEFARIOUS SCHEMES DID THE TERRORIST MASTER
MIND HAVE UP HIS SLEEVE.
>> WHAT IT SHOWS AGAIN IS THAT WHEN BILL LADEN WAS STILL INTENT ON ATTACKING
AMERICAN TARGETS, HE EVEN ASKED TO COME FOR HIS LIEU TEN ANTS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO A SASS FATE
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Jon: NICE WORK GETTING TO THAT IN A TIMELY FASHION.
SLOW BI WAN KENOBI.
WHAT WAS THE TITLE OF THAT PLAN'S MEMO, BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO ATTACK, WHAT
IS THAT SOUND, SOUNDS LIKE A HELL KORPT S THAT FOOT STEP,OUT MY EYE.
SO OBVIOUSLY THAT PLAN NEVER CAME TO FRUITION, ANYTHING MORE DOABLE ON HIS AGENDA.
>> HE TALKS SO MUCH ABOUT THE BIN LADEN BRAND AT AT ONE POINT EVEN WANTED TO
CHANGE THE NAME OF AL QAEDA.
>> Jon: WOW, I CAN SEE HOW WE NO LONGER WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, INNOCENT
DEATHS AND HOW THAT COULD HAVE AFFECTED AL QAEDA FROM A BRANDING PERSPECTIVE.
>> OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THE TIMES.
HOW ABOUT THIS INSTEAD OF AL QAEDA, AQ, YOU KNOW, MAYBE JUST A DIFFERENT NAME
COMPLETELY LIKE AL-TRIA OR SOMETHING ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHING POSITIVE,
AL-ROKER, HE'S LOVABLE.
OR, OR YOU COULD STOP WITH
