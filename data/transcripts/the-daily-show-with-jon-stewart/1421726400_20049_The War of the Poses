MIDDLE EAST THIS WEEK?
ISIS BEHEADING, AYATOLLAH ONTOILET, HARD CORE ANKLE
PORN. WHAT?
>> A SELFIE THAT'S BEEN STIRRINGUP ATTENTION AROUND THE WORLD.
>> THE SELFIE THAT'S CAUSING ASTIR AT THE MISS UNIVERSE
PAGEANT.
>> WHEN MISS ISRAEL POSTEDTHIS PICTURE ON INSTAGRAM WITH
MISS LEBANON ALSO IN THE SAMEPICTURE, IT TURNED POLITICAL.
>> CAUSING AN INTERNATIONALINCIDENT.
>> THEY'RE NOT MAKING OUT.
I MEAN I WOULD UNDERSTANDTHE INCIDENT IF THEY WERE
MAKING OUT.
IS THERE ONE WHERE THEY'RE -- NEVER MIND.
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THESELFIE?
IT'S NOT EVEN COED.
>> IN BEIRUT LEBANESETELEVISION STATION AL JAHEED
SAYS MISS LEBANON SHOULDHAVE KNOWN BETTER THAT TO
APPEAR IN A PHOTO WITHMISS ISRAEL BECAUSE LEBANON
AND ISRAEL ARE ENEMIES.
>> IT'S A BEAUTY PAGEANT.
THEY'RE ALL ENEMIES!
(LAUGHTER)LEBANON WAS PROBABLY JUST
TRYING TO-- (APPLAUSE)
TRYING TO WIN ISRAEL'STRUST SO THAT SHE COULD HIDE HER
CHICKEN CUTLETS AT THERIGHT TIME, YEAH, THOSE
THINGS. KIDDING ASIDE, THOUGH,GOOD FOR MISS LEBANON AND
ISRAEL, RISING ABOVE YOURCOUNTRY'S POLITICAL SQUABBLES
TO SAY TO THE WORLD, ON THEINSIDE, WE'RE THE SAME.
AND ALSO ON THE OUTSIDE,APPARENTLY THEY'RE THE SAME.
THEY'RE ALMOST COMPLETELYIDENTICAL.
IT'S REALLY INSPIRING.
>> MISS LEBANON WROTE QUOTEI WAS HAVING A PHOTOS WITH
MISS JAPAN, MISS SLOVENIA.SUDDENLY MISS ISRAEL JUMPED
IN, TOOK A SELFIE AND UPLOADEDIT ON HER SOCIAL MEDIA.
>> SALY GREIGE CLAIMED SHEWAS PHOTO BOMBED BY MISS

DOES EVERYTHING THATHAPPENS BETWEEN MIDDLE EAST
COUNTRIES HAVE TO BE ABOMBING?
DOES IT HAVE TO BE?
PHOTO, UNPHOTO?
EVEN JUST STANDING NEARSOMEONE?
AND SMILING.
AND WHY NOT JUST LET MISSISRAEL BE?
IN THE OVERALL AREA OF THATPHOTO, SHE'S ONLY TAKING UP
A VERY NARROW STRIP AT THEEDGE.
I MEAN WHAT DO YOU WANT TODO, PUT YOUR BACK TO, LET'S
SAY, PRE-1967 PHOTO BORDERS.?
I MEAN, IS THAT WHERE WE ARE-- (LAUGHTER)
SO, ONCE AGAIN WE FINDOURSELVES WITH A POTENTIALLY
EXPLOSIVE INTERNATIONALINCIDENT INVOLVING ISRAEL.
LET'S JUST HOPE A SENSITIVESKILLED DIPLOMAT WILL BE ON
HAND TO DIFFUSE THETENSIONS.
>> DONALD TRUMP OWNS THEPAGEANT IN A JOINT VENTURE
WITH NBC UNIVERSAL.
>> WELL, GRAB YOUR GASMASKS, KIDS, AND HEAD TO THE
SHELTER, WE'RE GOING DOWN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'MSAYING THIS, MAYBE KERRY
COULD HANDLE THIS.
BRING BILLY JOEL TO SING"SHE'S ALWAYS A WOMAN" OR
SOMETHING, THAT WILL EASETHE TENSION.
ANYWAY, WHAT DOES TRUMP EVENKNOW ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST
OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW, PRICE PERSQUARE FOOT OF RUGS.
>> WELL, THIS IS LONG-STANDINGHATRED.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FORMANY, MANY YEARS.
AND DECADES.
YOU SEE IT GOING ON TOSOMETHING AS BEAUTIFUL AS
WHAT IS TAKING PLACE INMIAMI.
AND IT CERTAINLY HAS ANIMPACT.
IT'S VERY SAD.
>> IT BREAKS MY [BLEEP] HEART TOSEE THESE
BEAUTIFUL LADIES FIGHTINGWHEN THEY COULD BE BUSY
PUTTING VASOLINE ON THEIRTEETH OR TAPING THEIR
SWIMSUITS TO THEIR BUTTOCKS.
HOWEVER, I DON'T SAY THISVERY OFTEN, DONALD TRUMP HAS
A POINT.
I GET THAT ISRAEL ANDLEBANON SHARE AN INTRACTABLE
ENMITY, BUT COME ON, THE MISSUNIVERSE PAGEANT?
IT'S THE ONE CHANCE IN THE WHOLEYEAR WHEN ALL NATIONS CAN PUT
ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCE, COMETOGETHER IN MIAMI AND AS ONE
TREAT WOMEN LIKE EXPENSIVEFOOD INSTEAD OF HUMAN
BEINGS.
DON'T RUIN THAT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
