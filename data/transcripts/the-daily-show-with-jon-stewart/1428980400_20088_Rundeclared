A GUY FROM A GRAVEL COMPANY.
THAT-- SO HILLARY RODHAMJEFFERSON STEINHAM CLINTON III
HAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCEDHER CANDIDACY FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
AGAIN.
I APPLAUD HILLARY FOR NOTACTING LIKE SHE IS DROP A
BOMBSHELL WITH THEANNOUNCEMENT BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, THIS ISN'T ABOUT HER.
>> SHE DOESN'T EVEN APPEAR UNTILHALFWAY THROUGH.
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO RUN ASAN UNDERDOG, MAKE IT CLEAR TO
VOTERS SHE WANTS TOEARN THEIR VOTES.
HECK, SHE IS DRIVING TO IOWA.
>> CLINTON'S ROAD TRIP ISDESIGNED TO SEND A NEW KIND
OF MESSAGE.
SHE'S LISTENING TO VOTERSAND IS DETERMINED TO EARN THEIR
SUPPORT THIS TIME AROUND.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S AREFRESHING CHANGE FROM HER
2008 STRATEGY.
SHUT UP, I'M TALKING. (LAUGHTER)
THE I AM INEVITABLE BUS TOUR.
REPUBLICANS, OF COURSE, HAVEBEEN ANTICIPATING THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT SINCE LIKE1978.
(LAUGHTER)THEY HAVE HAD AMPLE
TIME TO MAN THE RAMPARTS,STOCKPILE THE MUNITIONS,
RAND PAUL WAS FIRST OUT OFTHE GATE WITH A
CLINTON-THEMED CLASSIC,REPLETE WITH DYSTOPIAN
CLICHES BECAUSE ORWELLPREDICTED THE FUTURE WHERE
TV IS GIANT, NEVER IN COLORAND FOR SOME REASON OUTSIDE.
(LAUGHTER)RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS WAS
PREPARED WITH A HUMOROUSCLINTON-THEMED THUMB DRIVE
ATTACK PROP.
AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATETED CRUZ WAS ALSO PREPARED.
>> HILLARY CLINTONREPRESENTS THE FAILED
POLICIES OF THE PAST.
>> Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP]KIDDING ME?
RAND PAUL HAS GOT SAATCHI ANDSAATCHI ON THE CASE, PRIEBUS IS
MANUFACTURING PREMIUMS ANDARE YOU BANGING OUT A QUICK
VINE ON THE SET OF WHATLOOKS LIKE A 1970s PORNO
SHOOT?
(LAUGHTER)CAN WE ZOOM OUT ON THAT?
OH!
I KNEW IT!
I KNEW IT!
GUY'S DECAPITATING A PANDA.
FIRST TIME I SAW CRUZ I SAIDTO MYSELF, I BET THAT GUY
CHOPS UP PANDAS.
HE TAPED THAT IN A PANDACHOPPING DUNGEON. NUT!
AND OF COURSE THE PUNDITSWERE NOT IMPRESSED.
>> SHE HAS TREMENDOUS BAGGAGE.
I MEAN DO AMERICAN PEOPLEREALLY WANT ANOTHER FOUR, OR
EIGHT YEARS OF THE CLINTONS ANDTHEIR WEIRD MARRIAGE?
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: MAYBE, MAYBE I'M
OLD-FASHIONED-- I WANT APRESIDENT THAT IS PART OF A
COUPLE I CAN GET ALONG WITH.
MAYBE LATER ON IN THE NIGHTI COULD SWING WITH, RON AND
NANCY, YOU KNOW.
TWO GIN AND TONICS, I WOULDBANG EITHER ONE OF THEM.
(LAUGHTER)BUT OF COURSE AS ALWAYS ALL
RESPONSES PALE IN COMPARISONTO THAT OF NRA CEO
WAYNE LA PIERRE, MASTER OFUNDERSTATEMENT.
>> SHE WILL NOT BRING A DAWNOF NEW PROMISE AND
OPPORTUNITY.
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON WILLBRING A PERMANENT DARKNESS
OF DECEIT AND DESPAIR,FORCED UPON THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE TO ENDURE.

THIS HAUNTED WASTELAND,FEASTING ON THE BODIES OF
THE DEAD, CRYING OUT TO GODTO SAVE YOU FROM YOUR CURSED
EXISTENCE-- YOU WILL RUE THEDAY YOU VOTED FOR A CENTER
LEFTISH ESTABLISHMENTDEMOCRAT.

IS THERE ANY OTHER TRADEREPRESENTATIVE THAT ONLY
SPEAKS IN REVELATIONLANGUAGE?
BUT OF COURSE THE INEVITABLEAMERICA DESTROYING
APOCALYPSE THAT WILL RESULTFROM A CLINTON PRESIDENCY IS
NOT LA PIERRE'S ONLY GRIPEWITH CLINTON.
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, EIGHTYEARS OF ONE DEMOGRAPHICALLY
SYMBOLIC PRESIDENT IS ENOUGH.
