>> Jon: ON A SUPERFICIAL
LEVEL, ROMNEY'S
SUPERFICIALIALITY WOULD
APPEAR TO BE A DETRIMENT IN
EVER MOVING BEYOND HIS 23%
BUT I BELIEVE HIS
SUPERFICIALIALITY IS THE KEY
TO HIS STRATEGY.
HE IS CLEARLY SURVEYED THE
REPUBLICAN FIELD AND DECIDED
I THINK 23%'S ENOUGH TO BEAT
ANY OF THESE YAHOO!s.
(LAUGHTER)
SEE RIGHT NOW HERMAN CAIN
SHOT UP FROM 8% TO THE MID
30s.
HE'S BEATING ROMNEY.
IS HE A LONG-TERM THREAT TO
MITT ROMNEY?
>> WE DON'T HAVE A --
>> IT'S GOK LECH CUTED.
>> ELECTRIFIED.
>> COULD GOING TO BE A SIGN
ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS
IT WILL KILL YOU.
>> AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE
BEEN BRAINWASHED.
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING ANY
COMMUNITY IF THEY WANT TO
BAN A MOSQUE.
>> YES, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT
TO DO THAT.
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB
AND YOU ARE NOT RICH, BLAME
YOURSELF.
>> AND WOULD ASK ME WHO IS
THE PRESIDENT OF UBEKI BEKI
BEKI BEKI STANOZOLOL I AM
GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I
DON'T KNOW.
>> Jon: AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF THEY WANT ME TO VISIT
CROATIA I'M GOING TO BE LIKE
HEY, WHAT KIND OF [BLEEP]
NAME IS THAT.
SPEAK ENGLISH OVER HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY ROMNEY DOESN'T
HAVE TO REALLY SAY ANYTHING.
HIS STRATEGY IN THE DEBATE
SHOULD JUST BE HEY, MAN, I'M
HERE BUT I CEDE MY TIME
WHICH BRINGS TO US RICK
PERRY.
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS ALWAYS
SEEMS TO BE POSING FOR A BOX
FOR JUST FOR MEN HAIR
COLORING.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S DOWN IN THE POLLS--
(APPLAUSE)
HE'S DOWN IN THE POLLS
BECAUSE OF SOME POOR DEBATE
PERFORMANCES AND
QUESTIONABLE HUNTING GROUND
CHOICES.
(LAUGHTER)
SO HE'S GOT TWO CHOICES AT
THE BLACK JACK TABLE OF THE
ELECTION.
HIT OR STAY.
HERMAN CAIN OR ROMNEY.
WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT HE
CHOOSES WHEN HE INTRODUCES
HIS NEW TAX PLAN.
>> THE BEST REPRESENTATION
OF MY PLAN IS THIS-- .
>> Jon: OH, [BLEEP] GET DOWN
HE'S GOT A GUN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE BEST REPRESENTATION
IN MY PLAN IS THIS POSTCARD.
THIS IS THE SIZE OF WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
YOU KNOW, CENTRAL TO MY PLAN
IS GETTING EVERY AMERICAN
THE OPTION OF A 20% FLAT TAX
ON THEIR INCOME.
>> Jon: HOLY SMOKES HE
DIDN'T JUST TAKE A HIT, HE
IS DOUBLING DOWN ON CAIN.
[BLEEP] WHAT'S HERMAN CAIN'S
PLAN, NINE-NINE-NINE, THAT'S
THREE DIGIT, RIGHT?
MY PLAN'S TWO DIGITS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT'S ON A POSTCARD.
GIVES ME ROOM TO STICK IT ON
ONE DIGIT AND STICK IT ON A
POST-IT NOTE.
HERE'S THE THING RICK PERRY
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
IN THE RACE TO BE THE
CRAZIEST THERE CAN BE ONLY
ONE.
AND NO ONE PUTS HERMAN IN A
CORNER.
♪ IMAGINE THERE'S NO PIZZA ♪

>> Jon: ALL OF WHICH BRINGS
TO US OUR NEW SEGMENT, OH MY
GOD HERMAN CAIN IS EITHER
GOING TO BE OUR NEXT
PRESID
