[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW! MY NAME IS JONSTEWART.
OUR SHOW TONIGHT IS A FINE ONE.
MY GUEST TO THE IS ONE OF MY ALLTIME FAVORITES, MR. DAVE GROHL
WILL BE JOINING US IN A LITTLEBIT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLECONVERSATION.
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, FOR THEPAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS HERE ON
THE PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN DEALINGWITH THE FALLOUT FROM THE
GRAND JURY DECISION INMISSOURI FAILING TO INDICT THE
OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THESHOOTING DEATH OF
MICHAEL BROWN. WE DID OUR BESTHERE TO PROCESS THOSE EVENTS.
EVEN ENJOYED ACTUALLY A BIT OFFUN ACTUALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF
THE ST. LOUIS RAMS AND THE ST.LOUIS POLICE ASSOCIATION,
TWITTER WAR. AND I KNOW, IKNOW DOING THOSE BITS HELPS NO
ONE OTHER THEN MAYBE US HERE ATTHE SHOW INDIVIDUALLY AS
A CREATIVE OUTLET, A CATHARSIS AWAY OF PROCESSING EMOTION THAT
MIGHT OTHERWISE BE UNDIGESTED.
BY THE WAY, THAT PROCESS BROUGHTTO YOU BY ARBY'S.
ARBY'S, YOU THINK PAIN AND GRIEFARE HARD TO DIGEST.
[LAUGHING]BUT ANYWAYS.
AT LEAST THAT PROCESS HAS BEGUN.AND WE WERE GLAD TO BE ABLE
TO MOVE FORWARD EVER SO SLOWLYHOPING THAT WE MIGHT AS A
COUNTRY HAVE A RESPITE OF THESETYPES OF INJUSTICES.
AND WE DID HAVE A RESPITE FORMAYBE [BEEP] WHAT TIME IS IT?
> NO INDICTMENT IN THE DEATH OFERIC GARDNER.
A GRAND JURY IN NEW YORK CITYHAS DECIDED NOT TO CHARGE THE
WHITE POLICE OFFICER IN THEDEATH OF AN UNARMED
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TOSAY.
IF COMEDY IS TRAGEDY PLUS TIME INEED MORE [BEEP] TIME.
BUT I WOULD REALLY SETTLE FORLESS [BEEP] TRAGEDY TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT IS SOUTTERLY DEPRESSING IS NONE OF
THE AMBIGUITIES THAT EXISTED INTHE FERGUSON CASE EXIST IN THE
STATEN ISLAND CASE.
AND YET THE OUTCOME ISEXACTLY THE SAME.
NO CRIME, NO TRIAL, ALL HARM NOFOUL.
IN FERGUSON, AT LEAST YOU HADCONFLICTING WITNESS TESTIMONY,
YOU HAD CONFLICTING FORENSICS.
YOU HAD THE SPECTER AT LEAST OFPOLICE SELF DEFENSE.
BUT HERE THERE IS NONE OF THAT.
THE CORONER CALLED IT HOMICIDE.
THE GUY IS NOT ACTINGTHREATENING.
AND WE KNOW THAT NOT THROUGHWITNESS TESTIMONY UNRELIABLE
BYSTANDERS BUT BECAUSEWE ARE [BEEP] WATCHING IT.
SOMEONE TAPED IT.
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THE WHITEHOUSE PROPOSED MORE CAMERAS ON
COP VESTS AS A SOLUTION TO THISTYPE OF VIOLENCE.
I ASSUME THAT THE SOLUTION THATTHEY'RE PROPOSING IF IMPLEMENTED
WOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THEERIC GARDNER CASE.
I MEAN, MAYBE, TO LOOK AT THEBRIGHT SIDE WE'RE ABOUT TO SAVE
OURSELVES A [BLEEP] LOAD OFMONEY ON COP CAMERA VESTS.
BUT DAMN.
WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT LIVING INA POST-RACIAL SOCIETY.
AND I CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE ALOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE
WONDERING HOW MUCH OF A SOCIETYWE'RE LIVING IN AT ALL.
AND THAT'S OUR SHOW.
SO CHA-CHA-CHA.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
IT JUST HAPPENED.
SO I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TOREALLY DIGEST IT.
I'M GONNA NEED A SEGUE,I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE PIECE
OF VIDEO FOOTAGE TOCHANGE THE MOOD HERE.
[LAUGHING]OKAY.
IT'S NICE.
I LIKE IT.
ALTHOUGH, IN MY CURRENT FRAME OFMIND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER,
OH OF COURSE THE WHITE CATIS GETTING A MASSAGE.
AHHH! [BEEP]
