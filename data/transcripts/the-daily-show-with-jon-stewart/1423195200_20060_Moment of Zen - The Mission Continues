JOIN US NEXT WEEK AT 11:00.
BEFORE WE GO, RECENTLY, WE HADAN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO
THIS PROGRAM CALLED "MISSIONCONTINUES."
IT'S THIS INCREDIBLE PROGRAM FORRETURNING VETERANS THAT BRINGS
THEM BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN,IRAQ, AND ALLOWS THEM TO
CONTINUE TO SERVE THROUGH THESEFELLOWSHIPS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
AND TAKE THAT AMAZING ASSET THATIS THE VETERANS COMMUNITY AND
TRANSLATE IT BACK INTO HELPINGOUT AND STILL ALLOWING THEM TO
SERVE.
IT'S REALLY AN INCREDIBLEPROGRAM.
WE RAN A CONTEST THROUGH THISSITE OMAZE WHERE ANYBODY COULD
DONATE I THINK, LIKE, $10, ANDIT WAS A LOTTERY TO WIN A TRIP
TO NEW YORK, AND BE INTERVIEWEDHERE ON THE PROGRAM
BY SOME ASSHOLE. I'M SORRY.
THAT SHOULD HAVE SAID ME.
(LAUGHTER)THE WINNER WAS A FINE YOUNG MAN
BY THE NAME OF PAUL DORSO. ANDTHIS IS HIS INTERVIEW.
AND HERE IT IS, YOURMOMENT OF ZEN.
