>> Jon: HEY, OH, MY GOD!
HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
ANY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART AND I NEED A HAIRCUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS THE LONGEST HEAD I'VE EVER HAD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'VE GOT A NICE ONE.
THE ACTRESS ALISON BRIE WILL BE JOINING US FROM THE HIT SHOW "COMMUNITY." P MY GUESS IS SHE'LL IN NO WAY
TELL US WHAT IS GOING ON THERE BUT I'M EXCITED.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AMERICA.
AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE REFERENCE.
I PUT THAT UP THERE TO LET YOU KNOW.
REMEMBER THAT MAP FROM THE PLACEMAT AT HOWARD JOHNSONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS YOU KNOW, OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN ON A DIFFICULT RUN.
GAS PRICES HAVE RISEN STEADILY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
OUR PRESIDENT IS UNSURE WHETHER HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TARGET AMERICANS ON OUR MAINLANDSLANDS WITH MISSILES.
AND GERALDO IS THINKING OF RUNNING FOR SENATE.
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH RUN.
WE DECIDED TO DO A SEGMENT AIMED AT BOASTING OUR MORALE CALLED WE MAY BE (bleep) BUT -- LET ME
EXPLAIN TO YOU.
LET'S BEGIN WITH HORSEMEAT.
>> IMAGINE BUYING FROZEN HAMBURGERS AND LITTER DISCOVERING THAT THE PATTIES YOU
ASSUMED WERE BEEF WERE GROUND HORSE MEAT.
>> Jon: EWW.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU WON'T ME TO TOUCH WHERE YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
-- ME TO TOUCH YOU WHERE?
THAT'S WHERE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.
WHEN I BUY FROZEN GROUND BEEF I EXPECT MACHINE SHREDDED COW FILLED WITH 25% LIGAMENT AND
CARTILAGE MIXED BACK WITH THE OTHER STUFF I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S THERE.
GRADE A GROUND BEEF.
THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT.
NOTHING IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE QUEEN OF BBC.
A LOT OF PEOPLE EAT HORSE.
GOOD HONEST PEOPLE.
>> HORSE MEAT IS EAT MONEY IN A LOT OF COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE, ITALY, KAZAKHSTAN.
>> Jon: OKAY.
I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU PEOPLE THAT ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES YOU MENTIONED IS DIFFERENT FROM THE
OTHERS IN TERMS OF THEIR WORLDWIDE CUISINE.
SO MY VICE IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN AN INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF HORSE MEAT AND YOUR CHOICE IS
DISHESWISE ARE EQUAIN BOURGUIGNON, RIS SOTO ALA HORSEMEAT OR CAZZIC FRIED BUCKET
OF HORSE.
-- CHAAK FRIED -- BUCKET OF HORSE -- I DIDN'T KNOW WE'D SEE THE WHOLE FACE.
THE SCANDAL CAME TO LIGHT WHEN THE EUROPE VERSIONS OF BURGER KING BECAME EMBROILED --
[LAUGHTER]
-- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
>> THE HORSE MEAT IN QUESTION WAS SOURCED AT TWO PLACES IN ROMANIA.
>> Jon: WOW.
WHAT KIND OF WORLD DO WE LIVE IN WHERE WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST THE PRODUCT PURITY, THE REGULATORY
OVERSIGHT OF TRANSSILL -- TRANSYLVANIAN MEAT SLAUGHTER HOUSES.
DRACULA WOULD ROLL OVER IN HIS DAY BED.
>> SHARP REACTION FROM THE ROMANIAN PRIME MINISTER.
>> I'M VERY ANGRY TO BE VERY HONEST.
>> Jon: THAT DOES NOT SEEM SHARP.
YOU SEEMED MORE BEMUSED THAN ANGRY.
IT'S A TRYING NOT TO LAUGH PHASE.
IF YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS LAUGHING WHILE EUROPE'S
WEALTHIER UNKNOWINGLY EAT OUR INFORM PLOW HORSES -- BY THE WAY, ME ROMANIAN, WE PLAY JOKE,
WE PUT PEE PEE IN YOUR COKE.
[LAUGHTER]
DON'T WORRY.
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE FUN TODAY.
THE PRIME MINISTER OF ROMANIA DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
WE NEED A VILLAIN.
>> ANOTHER FIGURE WITH A MURKY HISTORY IS THIS MAN.
>> Jon: WORST J-DATE PICTURE EVER.
THAT DUDE IS SAY VILLAIN.
CHECK THAT GUY OUT.
ADDING HORSE MEAT TO HAMBURGERS LOOKS LIKE THE LEAST SLADEY THING THIS GUY HAS DONE.
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO RUFFI HIMSELF.
WHAT COULD I DO?
DID YOU SEE WHAT I WAS WEAR SOMETHING IN I WAS ASKING FOR IT.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK, I'M GLAD THEY -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ACCENT WAS, BY THE WAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M GLAD THEY FOUND THIS OUT AND THEY CAN PUT A STOP TO WHAT I'M ASSUMING IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.
>> 1% OF THE PRODUCTS TESTED, 29 OUT OF 2501 CAME BACK SHOWING POSITIVE FOR HORSE DNA.
>> Jon: THAT AIN'T NOTHING.
THAT'S LESS THAN 1% HORSE.
THAT'S THE KIND OF MILK I BUY.
1 PRS HORSE IS THE WORLD'S
