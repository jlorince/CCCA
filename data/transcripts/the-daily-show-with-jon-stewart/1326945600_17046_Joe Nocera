>> Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST
TONIGHT.
HE'S A BUSINESS COLUMNIST FOR
THE ANY
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND HE'S
THE COAUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLING
BOOK "ALL THE DEVILS ARE HERE."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK JOE NOCERA.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.
>> YOU ARE HERE ON A FINE NIGHT.
AS IT TURNS OUT, WE'RE HERE TO
DISCUSS THIS MITT ROMNEY ISSUE.
IT'S COME TO LIGHT THAT HIS TAX
RATE IS AROUND 15% NOT INCLUDING
A LITTLE BIT, A TRIFLE THAT HE
MAKES FROM SPEAKING FEES.
>> I SAW THAT.
>> IT SPEAKS TO THE DISTINCTION
IN OUR ECONOMY BETWEEN CAPITAL
AND INVESTMENT AND WORK.
>> THAT IT DOES.
>> AND I MAINTAIN THAT WORK IS
NOT AS VALUED SOMEHOW.
SOMEHOW INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL
HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN OUR
ECONOMY FROM WORK.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> YES, IN A WORD.
>> THANK YOU, YOU CAN GO.
>> I PASS.
FINANCIAL ENGINEERING IS AT THE
HEART OF WHAT WALL STREET NOW
DOES, WHAT IT HAS BECOME, AND
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS OF WHICH
MR. ROMNEY RAN FOR QUITE A WHILE
ARE AT THE HEART OF THAT.
YOU KNOW, THEY BUY UP COMPANIES.
THAT'S THE INVESTMENT.
THEY FIDDLE AROUND WITH THEM.
THEY BORROW AGAINST THEM.
THEY LAY OFF WORKERS QUITE
OFTEN.
THEY PULL OUT MONEY FOR THEIR
FEES, AND THEN THEY BRING THEM
BACK TO THE PUBLIC MARKET AND,
IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL, THEY
MAKE A FORTUNE, IF EVERYTHING
DOESN'T GO WELL, THEY STILL MAKE
A FORTUNE BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN
OUT ALL THE FEES.
AND BECAUSE THE MONEY THEY
INVESTED IS INVESTMENT CAPITAL,
WHAT THEY PAY THEMES IS A
CAPITAL GAIN.
>> Jon: CAPITAL GAIN IS TAXED
AT...
>> 15%.
>> Jon: NO MATTER HOW MANY
MILLIONS IT GETS TO?
>> YEAH, THAT'S, THAT'S... YES.
THAT IS WHY, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY
WHO IS IN PRIVATE EQUITY IS
REALLY MAD AT MITT ROMNEY RIGHT
NOW.
THEY'RE FURIOUS.
>> Jon: BECAUSE HE'S SHINING A
LIGHT?
>> THIS HAD BEEN AN ISSUE EARLY
IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,
SHOULD THESE GUYS BE TAXED LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE, LIKE WARREN
BUFFETT'S SECRETARY.
THE ISSUE THEN FADED, KIND OF
WENT AWAY.
AND NOW, HEY, IT'S BACK ON THE
FRONT PAGE AGAIN.
AND IT'S, GOSH, IT'S SUCH A
POLITICAL ISSUE THAT NEWT ROMNEY
THINKS... JON NEWT ROMNEY?
NEWT ROMNEY IS SOMETHING THAT'S
BEEN MADE IN A LAB.
>> A PRODUCT OF PRIVATE EQUITY.
IMAGINING THE NEXT HORROR MOVIE
SERIES.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT MAKES ME
UPSET, AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE
TO, QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT
THESE GROWTH AND CAPITAL GAINS
HAVE METASTASIZED AND GOT OUT OF
BALANCE WITH THEIR VALUE TO THE
ECONOMY, BECAUSE THERE IS A
VALUE TO CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT
AND RISK AND THE ECONOMY.
BUT TO QUESTION THAT IS SOMEHOW
CONFLATED WITH TO QUESTION THE
BASIC UNDERPINNINGS OF
CAPITALISM.
TO SUGGEST THAT WHAT THEY'RE
DOING IS JUST VERY FAIR, LAISSEZ
FAIRE, IT'S JUST SIMPLE RULES OF
THE ROAD AS THEY GOSH, IT
DOESN'T SEEM CORRECT THAT THAT
IS THE CASE, BUT TO QUESTION
THAT, YOU'RE SUDDENLY CALLED A
SOCIALIST FOR EVEN BRINGING IT
UP.
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT THIS REPUBLICAN PRIMARY
AND THESE FIGHTS.
I MEAN, THAT USED TO BE
COMPLETELY RIGHT.
THE QUESTION THAT WAS TO BE
SAID, OH, WELL, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW CAPITALISM WORKS,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WALL
STREET WORKS.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE FEED
THE ECONOMY WITH OUR CAPITAL.
NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE
IT'S NOT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION THAT'S SAYING,
HEY, MITT ROMNEY DESTROYS
COMPANIES, IT'S HIS BRETHREN IN
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO THE QUESTION OF
WHETHER YOU CAN QUESTION THIS
ANYMORE I THINK HAS CHANGED.
>> Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALL
FAIR UNTIL THE SYSTEM IS GAMED
ON YOU, AND THEN SUDDENLY...
THAT'S THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH A
LOT OF POLITICAL THEORIES.
I DON'T LIKE GAY MARRIAGE UNTIL
SUDDENLY YOU HAVE A GAY CHILD.
OH, WELL I GUESS THEY ARE
PEOPLE.
JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE, YEAH, THIS IS
UNFAIR, WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND
HERE.
IT BRINGS US TO THE SECOND
POINT, WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU
WROTE ABOUT, REGULATION.
TO SUGGEST YOU WANT REGULATION
SUDDENLY MEANS YOU WANT TO
STRANGLE AND CHOKE OFF
CAPITALISM.
COMPLEX REGULATION IS ACTUALLY A
PROBLEM.
IT NEEDS TO BE SIMPLE.
CAN THE GOVERNMENTÃ±r SIMPLY
REGULATE THESE BUSINESSES OR ARE
THEY JUST OUTCLASSED?
>> WELL, THEY ARE OUTCLASSED
TODAY.
THE ANALOGY I ALWAYS MAKE IS TO
THE 1930s.
IS THERE ANY SIMPLER REGULATION
THAN GOING TO J.P.M. MORGAN AS
WE DID IN THE 1930s AND SAID,
FELLAS, I KNOW HOW TO FIX YOUR
PROBLEM.
WE'LL CUT YOU IN TWO.
COMMERCIAL WEST BANK GOES OVER
HERE, INVESTMENT BANK, WHICH WE
DON'T CARE IF YOU GO OUT OF
BUSINESS, THAT'S ONLY
REGULATION, ONE REGULATION,
BOOM, SOLVED.
>>
>> Jon: THAT WOULD BE YOUR
GLASS BEAGLE.
>> THAT WOULD BE YOUR BASIC.
>> Jon: AND WE SAID LET'S STOP
DOING THIS.
>> TODAY WE HAVE FINANCIAL
CRISIS, THREE YEARS AGO, BUT
HEAVEN FORBID ANYONE SAY
ANYTHING AS RADICAL OR DRASTIC
AS HEY, LET'S CUT THEM IN TWO.
THAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
>> THE MORE COMPLEX IT IS, THE
MORE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO FIGURE
IT OUT AND THE MORE EASILY YOU
CAN FIT INTO NOOKS AND CRANNIES,
AND ISN'T IT COMPLEX BECAUSE THE
BUSINESSES THEMSELVES CREATE AN
ALMOST PURPOSEFUL COMPLEXITY.
>> YES, THAT'S TRUE.
THERE'S AT'S SPECT.
YOU SAID NOOKS AND CRANNIES
WHICH IS BEING WAY TOO NICE.
>> Jon: I LIKE THE YOU THE
THOMASES ENGLISH MUFFIN THING
WHEN I CAN.
>> IT ALLOWS THEM TO GAIN THE
SYSTEM.
THEY HIRE SMART PEOPLE AND PAY
THEM A LOT OF MONEY AND RUN
RINGS AROUND THE REGULATORS.
THAT'S THE WHOLE DEAL.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW THAT.
I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT.
>> Jon: I AM AWARE OF THAT.
I LIVE RIGHT NEAR THERE.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A
LITTLE BIT?
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BAIN
CAPITAL BEFORE WE GO ON THE
THING.
MORE WITH JOE NOCERA ON THE
WEBBY WEB.
IF IT'S STILL UP.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL BE ABLE TO
SEE THIS OR PORN OR ANYTHING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
JO
