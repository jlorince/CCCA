WE STARTED FILMING.
>> Jon: WERE YOU AWARE -- NOW,TIME, OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU'RE
THAT AGE, DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING,BUT, LIKE, YOU'RE JUST GETTING
USED TO OBJECT PERMANENCE ITHINK AT THAT POINT.
( LAUGHTER )WAS THERE EVER -- THIS IS
A 12-YEAR PERIOD. WAS THEREEVER A MOMENT WITHIN THAT
THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT DOING IT THIS YEAR?
THIS IS THE YEAR I'M NOT DOINGIT.
>> YOU KNOW, NOT REALLY.
I WAS CERTAINLY APATHETIC, YOUKNOW, AT A CERTAIN POINT.
I THINK, BUT IT WAS ALWAYS A LOTOF FUN.
I ALWAYS REALLY ENJOYED IT. YOUKNOW, I KIND OF AM EXPRESSING
MYSELF IS REALLY THE ONLYTHING THAT HAS EVER MADE ME
HAPPY AND I THINK IT WASALWAYS, YOU KNOW, A
GREAT OUTLET TO BE ABLE TO KINDOF EXPLORE WHAT I WAS GOING
THROUGH, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THISSORT OF FICTIONAL UNIVERSE.
>> Jon:  WOULD YOU TALK TORICK?
WOULD HE TALK TO YOU, ABOUT,HEY, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, AND YOUWOULD TRY AND WEAVE IN WHAT WAS
REALLY HAPPENING IN YOUR LIFEWITH WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE
STORY?
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN,WE WERE ALWAYS KIND OF IN
TOUCH AND DOING EXACTLY THAT,YOU KNOW, JUST COMPARING KIND
OF THE IDEAS THAT RICK HAD, YOUKNOW, WHICH WERE VERY MUCH FROM
HIS CHILDHOOD AND, YOU KNOW,KIND OF ETHAN'S EXPERIENCES,
AND THEN COMPARE THAT TO WHAT IWAS GOING THROUGH,
AND SEE WHERE, YOU KNOW, THETWO KIND OF INTERSECTED.
>> Jon: WAS THERE EVER A POINTIN THE PROCESS WHERE YOU THOUGHT
THIS COULD IMPRESS PEOPLE?
( LAUGHTER )LIKE GIRLS.
( LAUGHTER )AND YOU'D SAY TO YOURSELF, LIKE
YOU'D SAY TO THEM LIKE, "YOUKNOW, I'M IN A MOVIE?"
AND THEY'D BE LIKE, "OH, REALLY?
WHEN WILL IT BE OUT?""10 YEARS." YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, WAS THERE EVER THATLIKE, "COME ON, LET'S FINISH
THIS THING!"
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I KIND OFSTOPPED TALKING REALLY ABOUT IT
TO PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THATBECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO ABSTRACT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> AND SO KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
IT TAKES A GOOD 10 MINUTES TOREALLY GET THE CONCEPT
ACROSS AND PEOPLE'S EYES GLAZEOVER, AND THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE
YOU'RE IN A MOVIE BUT EIGHTYEARS, I MEAN WHAT IS THAT?
>> Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY.
>> IT'S HARD TO REALLYCOMPREHEND IT EVEN AS REAL WHEN
IT'S, YOU KNOW, A DECADE OUTSTILL.
>> Jon:  EVEN THEN, YOUKNOW, TO SEE IT FOR THE FIRST
TIME, WERE YOU WATCHING THROUGHTHE PROGRESSION OR DID YOU NOT
SEE IT AND THEN ALL IN ONE FELLSWOOP, WHEN IT WAS DONE THEY,
SAT YOU DOWN AND THEY SHOWED ITTO YOU?
>> YEAH, YEAH I WAITED UNTIL THEEND.
>> Jon:  I CAN'T IMAGINE--IT WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL MOVIE
FOR ME TO WATCH BECAUSE I HAVE ASON AND WAS ONE.
( LAUGHTER )I ASSUME.
>> RIGHT, THAT'S THE STORY.
>> Jon:  THAT'S THE STORYI'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE.
AS THE INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED, DOYOU FEEL DISASSOCIATED?
WAS IT EMOTIONAL IN THE SENSE OFWATCHING YOURSELF THROUGH THAT
PROCESS?
DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF AS AYOUNG BOY IN THAT?
WHAT'S THE FEELING?
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE FIRST--THAT FIRST TIME I WATCHED IT,
I WATCHED IT ALONE BEFORESUNDANCE, AND IT WAS.
IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT MYSELF.
YOU KNOW, I WAS KIND OF ALMOSTUNAWARE OF THE REST OF,
YOU KNOW, THE STORYAND ALL OF THAT.
IT WAS VERY MUCH JUST ABOUTWATCHING MYSELF GROW UP, AND YOU
KNOW, CHANGE PHYSICALLY ANDEMOTIONALLY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND KIND OF SEEING
THESE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, PARTSOF MY LIFE THAT WERE PROJECTED
ON THE SCREEN. AND, BUT SINCE,I'VE SEEN IT SEVERAL TIMES SINCE
THEN, AND IT'S BECOME EASIERTO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF TAKE
MY EGO OUT OF IT AND VIEW ITMORE AS A FILM AND MORE OF,
YOU KNOW, AN EXPLORATION OF THEPASSAGE OF TIME AND ALL
OF THAT, WHICH I THINK IS MOREWHAT IT'S ABOUT THAN --
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OFART.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FILM.
I THINK ALMOST MOST IMPRESSIVELYABOUT IT IS THAT SOMEHOW RICK
KNEW WHEN HE MET YOU, THAT YOUWEREN'T GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE
A DICK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
LIKE, HE JUST KNEW, THIS IS A
GOOD KID, AND IBET HE'S GOING TO BE A GOOD MAN,
AND IT REALLY MAKES IT AWONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.
