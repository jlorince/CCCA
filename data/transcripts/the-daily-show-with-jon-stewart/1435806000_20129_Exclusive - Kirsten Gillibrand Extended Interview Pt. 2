>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR KRISTENGILLIBRAND WHO JUST CURSED OUT
TOM COTTON.
I WAS JUST --  LISTEN, I HAVEBEEN AROUND THE BLOCK.
I WAS IN THE NAVY FOR EIGHTYEARS.
I WORKED AS A DOCK WORKER.
YOUR LANGUAGE SHOCKED ME.
I WAS STUNNED.
AND I WOULD ASK YOU-- I HAVECHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
I WOULD ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROMTHAT KIND OF SALTY TALK.
>> OF COURSE.
>> Jon: WHEN IS THE VOTE FORTHIS BILL?
>> WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE ITRIGHT AROUND SEPTEMBER 11th.
SO IF YOU WANT TO DOSOMETHING, CALL YOUR
CONGRESS MEMBER-- PLEASECALL THEM.
FRACKLY, THE ONLY TIMEANYTHING EVER WORKS IN
WASHINGTON IS WHEN REGULARPEOPLE STAND UP AND DEMAND
ACTION.
SO YOUR VOICE MATTERS.
PLEASE BE HEARD ON THISISSUE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: LET'S, LET'S DO THAT -- LET'S SCHEDULE A
CALL AND LET'S SCHEDULE ARITUAL SHAMING AROUND THAT
TIME.
FOR WHOEVER IT IS.
I OBVIOUSLY, AT THAT POINT,WILL BE KNEE-DEEP IN MORE
THAN LIKELY GRAIN ALCOHOL.
BUT FOR THOSE WHO WILL STILLBE FUNCTIONING IN OUR
SOCIETY, I THINK THAT-- ITHINK THAT WOULD BE-- I
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THATWE SHOULD SCHEDULE.
AND I PROMISE TO DO IT FROMMY BLOG OR WHATEVER.
HONESTLY, THE PATIENCE THATPEOPLE HAVE FOR THIS TYPE OF
THING.
MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT BILLIS THE EXACT SAME THING.
THE IDEA OF IT, THAT THEREIS PUSHBACK ON THESE
NO-BRAINERS.
AND BY THE WAY, IF THEYTHINK THERE ARE THINGS IN IT
THAT ARE INEFFICIENT OR THEYWANT TO MAKE WORK BETTER,
ALL FOR IT.
BUT THE OTHER STUFF.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE NEXT THINGCLOSE TO YOUR HEART THAT YOU
WANT TO GET DONE?
WAS'S NEXT?
>> WELL, I'M WORKING HARD ONALSO ENDING CAMPUS SEXUAL
ASSAULT AND I'M WORKING HARDON ACTUALLY PASSING A PAID
LEAVE PROGRAM FOR THE ENTIREUNITED STATES FOR ALL WORKER
TO MAKE SURE FAMILY MEMBERSWHO NEED CARE.
>> Jon: WHAT'S THE OTHERINDUSTRIALIZSED NATION THAT
DOESN'T DO THAT.
>> IT IS US AND PAPUA NEWGUINEA.
THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRYIN THE WORLD THAT DOESN'T HAVE
PAID LEAVE.
AND SO WHETHER YOU HAVE ASPOUSE THAT IS ILL, OR A
PARENT THAT IS DYING OR ANEW CHILD.
FAMILIES NEED FLEXIBILITY SOYOU DON'T HAVE TO QUIT YOUR
JOB.
THAT YOU CAN STAY ON COURSEAND NOT LOSE THAT PLACE IN
YOUR BUSINESS.
>> Jon: WHERE DID WE LOSETHE THREAD, IS OUR
GOVERNMENT JUST TOO BIG TOMANAGE NOW?
IS THAT THE PROBLEM?
JUST EVERYTHING JUST SLIPSUNDER THE THING, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
>> THE ISSUE IS, PEOPLE INCONGRESS ARE IN A BUBBLE.
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OFEMPATHY FOR REGULAR WORKING
FAMILIES.
AND YOU ASK YOUNG PEOPLETODAY, DO YOU THINK WILL YOU
HAVE TIME OFF WHEN YOU HAVEA BABY? THEY SAY OF COURSE
WE WOULD.
THE ANSWER IS MOST LIKELYNO.
ONLY 12% OF WORKERS TODAYHAVE ACCESS TO ANY PAID
LEAVE WHEN THEY HAVE A NEWCHILD OR WHEN THEIR SPOUSE
IS ILL OR THEY HAVE A FAMILYMEMBER WHO IS DYING.
AND IT'S JUST NOT GOOD FORWORKERS.
AND STATES THAT HAVE HAD PASSEDPAID LEAVE BILLS HAVE SHOWED
OVERWHELMINGLY, 90% OFBUSINESSES SAID IT WAS GOODS
FOR THE BOTTOM LINE.
>> Jon: RAISING THE MINIMUMWAGE HAS BEEN GOOD FOR THE
BOTTOM LINE.
AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU JUSTTHINK, ARE THEY LIKE
RAPACIOUS SOCIAL DARWINNIANCARICATURES OF VILLAINS?
ARE THEY DICKENSIAN SCROOGES?
I DON'T MIND PEOPLEBEING RESPONSIBLE WITH TAXPAYER
MONEY.
THAT IS IMPORTANT, TO MANAGEEFFICIENCIES, BUT THIS IDEA OF
FOOD STAMPS, YOU KNOW, THENEVERYBODY IS JUST GOING TO GO
OUT AND BUY SHRIMP AND SITAROUND AND DRINK MAITAIES.
>> YES, IT'S A LACK OFEMPATHY.
AND MOST MEMBERS MUCHCONGRESS DON'T EVEN REALIZE
IF YOU ARE ON THE MINIMUMWAGE YOU ARE UNDER THE
POVERTY LINE.
>> Jon: IS IT PATHOLOGICAL,THOUGH?
DO YOU NEW THEY HAVE MENTALPROBLEMS?
>> NO, I THINK THEY ARE OUT OFTOUCH.
I THINK MOST MEMBERS ARE OUTOF TOUCH AND DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR REGULARWORKING AMERICANS.
>> Jon: IS IT CYNICAL ORMANIPULATING A GRIEVANCE
INDUSTRY AMONGST VOTERS, THATPLAY INTO THAT AS THE VOTERS
AS VICTIMS OF THISENTITLEMENT CULTURE?
OR DO THEY TRULY BELIEVE IT?
OR IS IT A MORE CYNICALEXERCISE IN POLITICS.
>> I THINK IT'S CYNICISM,PERSONALLY.
AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE PAIDLEAVE ISSUE, MOST MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS ARE FAIRLYAFFLUENT.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT ISLIKE TO NOT HAVE ANY CHILD
CARE AT HOME OR TO NOT BEABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF IN
SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY IS ILL.
THEY'VE NEVER LIVED IT.
>> Jon: THEY EARNED ON THEIROWN, ONLY THEY HAVE EARNED
IT.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICKYOURSELF UP OUT OF POVERTY
AND DESPAIR AND THEN YOU CANBE IN THE SENATE, AND IF I
GIVE YOU FOOD STAMPS THAT ISGOING TO SEND A VERY BAD
MESSAGE TO YOU THAT YOU GETTO EAT.
AND THAT'S-- YOU KNOW --
>> YEAH, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO TELL YOU.
IT IS CRAZY OUTRAGEOUS.
DO YOU EVER-- YOU DON'T HAVETO ANSWER THIS.
DO YOU EVER PUNCH ANYBODY?
LIKE WITH YOU'RE JUST INTHEIR OFFICE AND JUST BE
LIKE OH, I'M SO SORRY, IHAVE TO DECK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, NO.
>> Jon: OKAY.
SENATOR, IT'S ALWAYS APLEASURE.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: GET THAT 9/11BILL-PASSED.
KRISTEN GILLIBRAND.
