WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A SENIOR FELLOW WITH THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL.
HIS NEW BOOK WHICH HE COAUTHORED IS CALLED THE BLOOD PRESSURE OBAMA'S PLAN TO BUILD AN
IMPERIAL PRESIDENT SIX PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM KEN BLACKWELL.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I SEE YOU'VE BROUGHT READING MATERIAL.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET BORED?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I DON'T GET BORED, JON.
I WAS MAYOR OF CINCINNATI AFTER JERRY SPRINGER.
>> Jon: OH, MAN.
>> THAT'S JUST A GREAT EXAMPLE THAT SOMETIMES THE SUBLIME DOES FOLLOW THE RIDICULOUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: YOU HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK.
IT'S CALLED "OBAMA'S PLAN TO SUBVERT THE KPAOUGS AND BUILD AN
IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY." OBVIOUSLY, LOOK, OUR AUDIENCE,
MIFUL IS PROBABLY NOT ON BOARD WITH MOST OF THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY --
>> SPEAKING OF LIBERTY.
>> Jon: I'M A BIG FAN OF LIBERTY.
BELLS, THE WHOLE THING.
I LOVE IT ALL.
LADY LIBERTY.
THE REAL QUESTION I GUESS I HAVE IS -- SO SAY THAT SOMEONE SUBVERTING THE CONSTITUTION,
BUILDING AN IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY,
IT'S A SERIOUS CHARGE.
WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS POLITCALLY BUT THIS IS IN SOME RESPECTS PUTTING HIS PRESIDENCY INTO THE
UNDEMOCRATIC TYRANT CATEGORY.
I'M STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS SO DIFFERENT IMPERIALLY ABOUT THIS PRESIDENCY FROM
GEORGE BUSH'S PRESIDENCY.
YOU SUPPORTED GEORGE BUSH.
I'M CURIOUS LIBERTYWISE.
>> SO THAT YOU ARE CLEAR, I CRITICIZED THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PARTICULARLY.
>> Jon: REALLY THE LAST -- IT SOUND LIKE YOU SAID EIGHT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO USE A DIFFERENT FIGURE.
>> I'M SURE YOU WOULD.
I'M SURE YOU WOULD.
>> Jon: WHAT IS IT?
>> I THOUGHT THAT JUST AS OVER SAID THE TABLE FOR F.D.R. AND HIS EXPANSION OF CENTRALIZED
GOVERNMENT, BUSH IN HIS LAST EIGHT MONTHS SET THE TABLE FOR THIS GIGANTIC EXPANSION OF THE
ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES,
CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT.
SO IT STARTED.
>> Jon: WHY EIGHT MONTHS?
BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE MORE ON THE SIDE THAT GEORGE BUSH DID THAT EXPANSION WITH HIS SIGNING
STATEMENTS AND AGAIN WITH -- NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WAS A UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT FORCED ON STATES.
ALL THOSE THINGS WERE IN PLAY LONG BEFORE.
ADMITTEDLY IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS THERE WAS AT BAIL YOWRT.
HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY EXPANDING ON RONALD REAGAN WAS ABOUT CONSOLIDATING PRESIDENTIAL POWER.
>> I WILL LET YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE WRITE THE BOOK.
>> Jon: YOU WROTE THE BOOK.
>> I DID BUT IT'S ON OWE BALM WHY'S PLAN.
HE USED AS A FOUNDATION THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS AND THE DECISIONS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MUCH
LIKE F.D.R. DID WITH OVER -- HOOVER.
ALL I'M SAYING TO YOU IS THAT ONE, THERE'S AN INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT DEBATE.
THE BOOK REALLY JUST HIGHLIGHTS IT.
THAT IS ON THE ONE HAND THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO COLLECT THE WORLD BEING.
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.
>> Jon: WHY ARE THOSE AT ODDS?
>> BECAUSE ONE, COLLECTIVE WELL BEING SOMETIMES REQUIRES LEVELING.
SOMETIMES IT REQUIRES A GOVERNMENT-DRIVEN ECONOMY AS OPPOSED TO A MARKET-DRIVEN ECONOMY.
I THINK THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CHANGE THE ROLE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE
GOVERNMENT --
>> Jon: YOU ARE SUGGEST THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS FUNDAMENTALLY SUBVERTED THE CONSTITUTION SO SPECIFICALLY.
>> LET ME TELL YOU.
>> Jon: I WAS JUST QUOTING THE TITLE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S A GOOD QUOTE BECAUSE I THINK THE CONSTITUTION IS A BIG BOLDER IN -- BOULDER IN THE
TROLL EXPANDING THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS CENTRAL TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN.
>> Jon: SPECIFICALLY --
[LAUGHTER]
-- WHAT HAS HE DONE SO SUBVERT THE CONSTITUTION.
>> SPECIFICALLY OBAMA-CARE.
>> Jon: OKAY.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.
>> THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.
>> Jon: WON'T THAT -- IF THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND I DON'T
KNOW I'M NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR ALTHOUGH I DO WATCH JUDGE JUDY.
IF THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL HE HAS NOT TRIED TO STOP LAWSUITS AGAINST IT.
THE COURTS WILL DECIDE.
ISN'T THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE SYSTEM AND NOT A SUB VERSION OF IT.
>> THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THIS BOOK.
WE'RE ENGAGING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN A BEBAIT.
NOT ONLY OBAMA CARE.
HE HAS BEEN SERVED UP A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE COURSE IN OUR COUNTRY.
AND I THINK HE WILL.
I THINK HE WILL CHANGE IT FROM --
>> Jon: ISN'T THAT -- WHEN YOU ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT ISN'T IT
YOUR RIGHT TO APPOINT JUDGES.
HE HAS APPOINTED LESS IN HIS TIME IN OFFICE THAN GEORGE BUSH DID AT A SIMILAR TIME.
>> NO HE HASN'T.
>>
>> Jon: NO, NO, HE HAS.
OBAMA HAS APPOINTED LESS THAN GEORGE BUSH DID AT THE SAME TIME.
>> LET MEï¿½iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r PUT IT THIS WAY.
>> Jon: NO, NO IT'S A FACT.
IT'S NOT ANOTHER WAY.
IT'S A NUMBER THAT IS LARGER.
>> I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AT THE END OF THE DAY WILL HAVE MORE
OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE THE APPELLATE COURT THAN GEORGE BUSH.
THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HE CONTROLS THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
AND AS A --
>> Jon: IN 2010 IT COULD CHANGE.
>> THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING THE DEBATE.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT SUBVERTING.
IF THE DEBATE IS I DON'T LIKE YOUR PROGRAMS OR I DON'Tï¿½i LIKE
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE JUDGES THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPOINT THAT'S A DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION THAN YOU ARE BECOMING A TYRANT AND SUBVERTING THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE THAT'S
A VERY EMOTIONAL-LOADED STATEMENT THAT IS NOT SEEMINGLY BACKED UP BY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF, I GUESS YOU CALL THEM FACTS.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S --
>> I THINK THIS BOOK IS AS WELL RESEARCHED AS ANY BOOK ON THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S
INITIATIVES OVER THE LAST, YOU KNOW, 15 MONTHS.
IT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR WHAT HE IS DOING WITH THE CZARS.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
HERE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
WE'RE OUT OF TIME FOR THE "RED SOX GAMEDAY LIVE".
I'M GOING TO BE LIKE "THE BLUEPRINT" IT'S ON BOOKSHELVES
NOW KEN BLACKWELL AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION.
WE WON'T HE HAD ITITY SHALL HE HAD HE HAD HE EDIT IT.
