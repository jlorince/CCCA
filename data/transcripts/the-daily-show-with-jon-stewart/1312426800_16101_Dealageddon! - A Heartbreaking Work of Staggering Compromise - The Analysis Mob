[LAUGHTER]
FOR MORE ON PUBLIC SUSPECTMENT
TOWARDS WASHINGTON, WE'RE JOINED
BY THE BEST [BLEEPED] PUBLIC
MOOD GAUGERS ON TELEVISION.
JONES, BEE AND CENAK.
LET'S DO THIS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH YOU.
JASON JONES, IN EVERY POLL WE'RE
HEARING AMERICANS DESCRIBE
CONGRESS IN TERMS LIKE STUPID,
CHILDISH, DISGUSTING.
YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> WELL, AMERICANS ARE A
FORGIVING BUNCH.
I SEE CONGRESS MORE AS A BUNCH
OF MONKEYS HIGH-FIVING EACH
OTHER IN CELEBRATION, HAVING
FORGOTTEN THAT MERE MOMENTS AGO
THEY WERE THROWING THEIR OWN
FECES.
NOW THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
THEY'RE ALL COVERED IN EACH
OTHER'S TURDZ.
>> Jon: SO TO BOIL CONGRESS
DOWN TO A WORD?
>> [BLEEPED] COVERED MONKEYS.
ONE WORD.
NO SPACES.
>> I'M SORRY, JON.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK IN
HERE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SAM BEE.
>> I THINK JASON GIVES THEM TOO
MUCH CREDIT.
EVEN A ROOM FILLED WITH
[BLEEPED] COVERED MONKEYS WOULD
EVENTUALLY DESIGN A MORE
THOUGHTFUL AND RATIONAL DEFICIT
REDUCTION PLAN THAN WHAT WE'RE
SEEING.
NO, THE EVENTS OF RECENT WEEKS
CAN BE SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE
WORD.
DEIS-SCHMERZEN-MUTTER-TOOBEN.
>> Jon: DEIS-SCHMERZEN...
>> IT IS A GERMAN WORD FOR THE
SENSE OF DECEMBER SPARE ONE
FEELS WATCHING A BELOVED
GRANDPARENT ACCIDENTALLY
STRANGLE THEMSELVES WITH A
GARDEN HOSE THAT YOU BOUGHT THEM
FOR THEIR 50th WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HOW OFTEN DO GERMANS
NEED THE USE THAT WORD?
>> WELL, YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
AND THAT SURPRISE IS CALLED
SHOCKEN-DOOBLE.
OH, GOSH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
LANGUAGE.
>> JON, IF I COULD PLEASE STEP
IN.
>> Jon: WYATT CENAK.
>> TO CHARACTERIZE CONGRESS AS A
BUNCH OF MONKEYS OR A GERMAN
EMOTION FAILS TO CAPTURE THE
SENSE OF BETRAYAL AMERICANS FEEL
TOWARDS THEIR POLITICIANS.
SOME THINGS ARE SO HORRIBLE MERE
WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS THEM.
JON JON HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP?
>> WITH THE WONDERFUL LANGUAGE,
JON.
INTERPRETIVE DANCE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> IF THE MAJORITY WERE SERIOUS
ABOUT DEFICIT REDUCTION, THEY
WOULD ALLOW REVENUES.
>> PUT SOMETHING ON THE TABLE.
>> AT THE EXPENSE OF THE
EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN.
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE SPEND
TOO MUCH.
>> THE RICH WILL FEEL NO PAIN.
>> MY POMEGRANATE TREES ARE I'M
TOLD BLOSSOMING.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> I'M GOING WITH [BLEEPED]
