QUESTIONS AFTER REDECORATING HISCAPITOL HILL OFFICE SUITE
IN THE STYLE OF THE PBS TVSERIES "DOWNTON ABBEY."

BUT ALSO AUDITORS ARE GOING TOAUDIT, INDICTERS ARE GOING TO
INDICT AND VOTERS ARE GOING TOVOTE.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AREGOING TO BE FULFILLING THEIR
TAUTOLOGICAL ROLES.
BUT THE DOWNTON OUTCRY LEDTO AN EVEN CLOSER EXAMINATION OF
SCHOCK'S ACCOUNTING ANDIT TURNS OUT HE'S BEEN
SPENDING MONEY ON A LOTMORE THAN THROW PILLOWS.

FIGURE'S MISDEEDS REQUIRES ANEWS ORGANIZATION TO LAUNCH
A MASSIVE INVESTIGATIONAPPARATUS, DEEP OFF-THE-RECORD
SOURCING, FOIA REQUESTS, DEEPLATE-NIGHT DUMPSTER DIVING.
THAT'S HOW OF NOT HOW JOURNALISMWORKS IN 2015.

THEM ON INSTAGRAM, AND HE DID SOAROUND THE COUNTRY, AND THE
A.P. WAS ABLE TO FIND OUT WHEREHE WAS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND

ONE OF MY WRITERS CLAIMED HE WASSICK WITH OVARIAN CYSTS WHEN
IN FACT, I FOUND OUT HE WASAT THE HAMPTON LOBSTER FESTIVAL
STUFFING HIS MOUTH TWO POUNDERS.
I'M ON TO YOU, MATT KOFF!

YEARS OLD AND NEVER DOES STUFFLIKE THIS.
