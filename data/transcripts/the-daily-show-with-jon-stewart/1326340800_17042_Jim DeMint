I'M ABOUT TO TALK TO JIM
DeMINT, EVEN THOUGH I JUST
TALKED TO HIM AND THERE'S A
WEIRD EDITED POINT WHERE IT JUST
STOPS AND GOES TO THE VERY END.
ALL THAT'S ON THE WEB BECAUSE I
SPOKE WITH HIM FOR 15 HOURS.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'VE GOT SOME EXCITING NEWS.
[WHISPERING:] WE SETTLED
EVERYTHING.
WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE JUNIOR
UNITED STATES SENATOR
REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OF
SOUTH CAROLINA, HIS NEW BOOK IS
CALLED "NOW OR NEVER: SAVING
AMERICA FROM ECONOMIC COLLAPSE."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
SENATOR JIM DeMINT.
SIR.
>> HELLO, JON.
>> Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I THINK I'M AFRAID TO GO HOME TO
SOUTH CAROLINA NOW AFTER I'VE
SENIOR REPORT.
>> Jon: I DON'T BLAME YOU.
WE'LL GET TO THE BOOK IN A
SECOND, SO HOW DO THE PEOPLE
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA FEEL ABOUT
THE CHANGE IN AT MOST FEAR EVERY
YEAR?
IT GOES FROM FIELD OF DREAMS TO
"THE SHINING."
SOUTH CAROLINA IS ALWAYS THE
BLOODBATH.
>> IT'S KIND OF THE LAST STAND
FOR A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES.
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME THAT
ARE DESPERATE AND IN SOUTH
CAROLINA GUESS THE BRUNT OF IT.
BUT IT'S A ROUGH AND TANGLED
POLITICAL STATE, AND AFTER
LOOKINGWHAT YOU SHOWED TONIGHT,
I WONDER HOW I EVER GOT THROUGH
A PRIMARY IN SOUTH CAROLINA
MYSELF.
BUT I'M GOING TO STAY IN NEW
YORK A COUPLE DAYS.
>> Jon: I THINK YOU SHOULD,
WHERE PEOPLE ARE KIND.
[LAUGHTER]
>> NO COMMERCIALS.
>> Jon: NO COMMERCIALS.
NOW BEFORE SOUTH CAROLINA IN
2008, YOU ENDORSED MITT ROMNEY.
>> YES, I DID.
>> NOW IT TURNS OUT HE'S RUNNING
AGAIN, HAS BEEN ACTUALLY, SINCE
THEN.
[LAUGHTER]
DO YOU WANT THE MAKE HISTORY
TONIGHT?
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE NEWS?
DO YOU WANT TO ENDORSE MITT
ROMNEY AHEAD OF THE SOUTH
CAROLINA PRIMARY?
>> NO, I LIKE THEM ALL.
>> Jon: SO YOU DON'T LIKE
ANYBODY?
>> WELL, I FOUND THAT I CAN MAKE
A DIFFERENCE HELPING TO ELECT
CONSERVATIVE SENATORS, AND
THAT'S WHAT I DID LAST CYCLE.
MY PARTY DIDN'T NECESSARILY LIKE
IT, BUT PEOPLE LIKE RAND PAUL
AND MARCO RUBIO HAVE HELPED TO
CHANGE THE SENATE, AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO THIS TIME
IS TRY TO GET SOME YOUNG FOLKS
WITH A LITTLE DIFFERENT...
>> Jon: THAT GETS US TO THE
BOOK.
THE THEME IS "NOW OR NEVER."
THERE WE GO.
IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC
PRESCRIPTION.
THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
CERTAINLY VERY LEGITIMATE POINTS
OBVIOUSLY.
YOU TALK ABOUT REGULATION
SOMETIMES, STRANGLING BUSINESS,
THAT KIND OF THING, THE TAX FOR
CORPORATIONS.
I GUESS THE THING THAT CONFUSES
ME ABOUT THIS IS WITH ALL THE
TERRIBLE STRANGLING OF
REGULATIONS AND BUSINESSES, WHY
HAVE THE WEALTHY IN THIS COUNTRY
OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS DONE SO
DISPROPORTIONATELY BETTER THAN
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IF THE
POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE
ARE SO STRANGLING TO THE JOB
CREATORS?
>> I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE
TIME TO READ THE BOOK.
VERY FEW HOSTS DO THAT.
>> Jon: MADE FAR WONDERFUL
NIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
, IN FACT,
>> I SEE YOU HAVE SOME RINGS
UNDER YOUR EYES.
WHEN YOU CENTRALIZE POWER
POLITICALLY, YOU DO IT
ECONOMICALLY.
&AQ!IS COUNTRY EXCEPTIONAL, ANDS
WHAT I WRITE ABOUT IS THE
DEVALIZATION OF POWER FROM THE
BOTTOM-UP ECONOMICS.
THAT CREATES MORE OF A MIDDLE
CLASS.
THERE IS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION
ABOUT THE RICH IN OUR COUNTRY.
50% OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY
WERE MILLIONAIRES FOR ONE YEAR.
WE HAVE A REVOLVING DOOR.
WE DON'T HAVE A PERMANENT CLASS
OF MILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA LIKE
A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT WE
DO HAVE A PROBLEM IN THE MIDDLE
CLASS.
IT HASN'T BEEN CAUSED BY FOLKS
WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
IT'S BEEN CAUSED WE A LOT OF
POLICIES I TALK ABOUT THAT MAKE
IT HARDER TO KEEP MIDDLE-CLASS
JOBS IN AMERICA.
>> YOU TALK ABOUT SPENDING.
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.
BUT A LOT OF THE CUTS ARE JUST
SORT OF WE NEED TO CUT THE
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.
WE NEED TO CUT THE E.P.A.
IT DOESN'T EVER SEEM TO TIE
SPENDING TO VALUE.
THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH THE
PEOPLE THAT JUST WANT TO GO IN
SOMETIMES AND SLASH THE
GOVERNMENT BUDGET IS THERE SEEMS
TO BE NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN
MONEY THAT IS SQUANDERED AND
INVESTMENT THAT CREATES JOBS.
HEAD START IS A PROGRAM THAT IS
I THINK INVALUABLE TO KIDS AND
BY STARTING THEM EARLY AND
GETTING THEM, ULTIMATELY IN THE
LONG RUN, WON'T THEY DO BETTER?
SO ISN'T THAT AN ENTITLEMENT...
>> PRESCHOOL IS IMPORTANT, AND
THERE ARE SOME HEAD START
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE DONE WELL,
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A TOTAL
ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM, THERE'S
A LOT OF WASTE AND
INEFFECTIVENESS.
FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL, IT'S
HARD TO DO THINGS WELL.
YOU DON'T FIND TOO MANY FEDERAL
PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING.
>> SO WHY DO WE LET THEM FIGHT
OUR WARS?
>> WE HAVE AN AUTHORITY... AT
LEAST UNTIL RECENTLY, THE
MILITARY IS NOW RUN BY CONGRESS,
BY POLITICAL PEOPLE, BY THE
PRESIDENT'S COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,
BUT THERE'S AN AUTHORITY SYSTEM
THERE.
>> Jon: BUT IT IS CIVILIAN
CONTROLLED.
>> WE POLITICALLY MANAGE THE
PROGRAMS.
THE MONEY IS NOT DISTRIBUTED
WELL, AND THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE... WE SPEND TRILLIONS
TRYING TO HELP POVERTY IN
AMERICA.
BUT WE DON'T CURE IT, WE
SUBSIDIZE IT.
WE MAKE PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THE
GOVERNMENT AND MAKE IT HARDER
FOR THEM TO GET UP THE LADDER.
>> Jon: I HEAR THAT ARGUMENT A
LOT ABOUT SORT OF THIS
DEPENDENCY, FOR INSTANCE, I LIVE
IN NEW YORK, WE'RE A GIVER
STATE.
IN TERMS OF EVERY DOLL THEY'RE
WE PUT INTO THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT, WE GET BACK 80 CENTS
IN NEW YORK.
SOUTH CAROLINA IS I GUESS WHAT
YOU WOULD CALL A NON-GIVER.
FOR EVERY DOLLAR SOUTH CAROLINA
PUTS IN, THEY GET BACK $1.35.
SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT SOUTH
CAROLINA IS A DEPENDENT CULTURE
STATE THAT NEEDS TO BE RIPPED
FROM THE FEDERAL TEET?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> PART OF IT, IF YOU LOOK AT
TRANSPORTATION, WE GET BACK 90
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR.
>> Jon: I'M TALKING TOTAL.
>> LOOK AT MEDICAID.
WE WOULD LOVE TO GET OUT FROM
THE FEDERAL UMBRELLA WHERE WE
HAVE TO DO WHAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TELLS US TO DO.
>> Jon: YOU WANT A BLOCK
GRANT.
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE HEALTH
INSURANCE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE
AND ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE,
BUT WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
TIES IT ALL UP IN KNOTS WITH
REGULATION, SAME THING WE DO
WITH EDUCATION, THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT PROVIDES LESS THAN
10% OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC
EDUCATION, BUT SOME OF OUR
SCHOOLS WILL SAY UP TO 50% OF
THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE
RELATED TO ALL OF THE PROGRAMS
THEY HAVE.
>> HERE'S THE THING: I DON'T
DOUBT THAT THERE ARE REGULATORY
ISSUES AND THERE ARE CONTROL
ISSUES, BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT I
HEAR FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES AND
SORTS OF THE TEA PARTY FACTION
OR THE MORE CONSERVATIVES IS SO
APOCALYPTIC YOU WRITE IN THE
BOOK, THIS IS A BATTLE BETWEEN
COLLECTIVISM AND FREEDOM.
AND OUR COUNTRY WAS DESIGNED AS
A BALANCE BETWEEN COLLECTIVISM
AND FREEDOM.
COLLECTIVEIVE.
, WE'RE THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
THAT'S COLLECTIVISM.
FROM THE GET GO.
>> JON, IT WAS VERY
DECENTRALIZED.
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE
CONSTITUTION WAS TO LIMB WHAT
COULD BE DONE AT THE FEDERAL
LEVEL.
>> IT SEEMED TO ME THE WHOLE
POINT WAS TO CENTRALIZE POWER
THAT WASN'T CENTRALIZED IN THE
ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, WHICH
THEY FELT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE
THEY WERE TOO DECENTRALIZED.
>> WELL, FOR MILITARY
PARTICULARLY, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT
THE CONSTITUTION, THERE ARE JUST
A FEW THINGS THEY WANT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO, MAKE
SURE INTERSTATE COMMERCE WORKS.
>> IS YOUR PROBLEM THE
GOVERNMENT CAN NOT DO IT WELL OR
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO?
>> REALLY BOTH.
THE REASON IT'S NOT DOING WELL
IS OUR FOUNDERS HAD A LOT OF
WISDOM IF YOU MOVE CENTRAL FOUR
ONE PLACE I DOESN'T WORK VERY
WELL.
>> Jon: TELL TRUTH, THOUGH,
YOU'VE ENJOYED THIS A LITTLE
BIT.
IT'S KIND OF FUN.
>> MORE THAN I THOUGHT.
>> Jon: SEE!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
WELL, LISTEN, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
I TOOK UP AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUR
TIME, BUT I FIND THIS
FASCINATING.
WHEN I READ THE BOOK, I CAN'T
TELL YOU MY DANDER DOESN'T GET
UP A FEW TIMES, BUT I THINK
TALKING IT OUT HELPS A LITTLE
BIT.
AND I'LL DEFINITELY READ IT
AGAIN TONIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
IS IT ON TAPE?
BECAUSE I'LL LISTEN SO IT.
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
>> Jon: YOU SHOULD DO IT ON
TAPE.
>> IT IS ON TAPE AND I READ IT
MYSELF, AND I REALIZE I DO HAVE
MARBLES IN MY MOUTH AS A
SOUTHERNER.
A NEW YORKER IN THE AUDIENCE
TONIGHT TRIED TO COACH ME
THROUGH THIS, AND EVERY SENTENCE
WAS, LET'S TRY THAT ONE MORE
TIME.
>> Jon: THE ACCENT IS LIKE
GUYS, HEY, WHOA, WHAT'S GOING
ON.
"NOW OR NEVER" IS ON BOOKSHELVES
NOW.
WE ENJOY TALKING TO YOU.
COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN.
