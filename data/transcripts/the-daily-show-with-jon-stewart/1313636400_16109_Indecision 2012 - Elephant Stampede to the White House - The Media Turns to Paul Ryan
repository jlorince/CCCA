[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAIL
SHOW.
I'M JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT... OH, YOU'RE
TOO KIND.
OUR GUEST, FORMER REPUBLICAN
PARTY CHAIRMAN... OUR GUEST
TONIGHT, FORMER REPUBLICAN PARTY
CHAIRMAN MICHAEL STEELE HERE
ONCE AGAIN IN NON-PUPPET FORM.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
MUCH MORE DYNAMIC IN NON-PUPPET
FORM.
OUR COVERAGE OF THE ELEPHANT
STAMPEDE TO THE WHITE HOUSE
CONTINUES.
AS YOU MAY RECALL, SUNDAY
BELONGED TO THE FIERY
CONGRESSWOMAN FROM MINNESOTA
MICHELE BACHMANN, WHOSE
PERFORMANCE AT THE AMES STRAW
POLE VAULTED HER TO THE FRONT OF
THE RACE.
>> FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR VICTORY.
>> Jon: BUT THAT WAS SUNDAY.
[LAUGHTER]
AFTER CAREFUL REFLECTION, IT WAS
DECIDED MONDAY AND TUESDAY
BELONGED TO TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK
PERRY, WHOSE STUNNING ENTRANCE
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE VAULTED
HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE RACE.
>> CHARISMATIC.
HE BRINGS A NEW EXCITEMENT AND A
LOT OF BUZZ TO THE G.O.P.
LANDSCAPE.
>> Jon: IN FACT, PERRY REMINDS
ME A BIT OF A FORMER REPUBLICAN
CONTENDER MICHELE BACHMANN, WHO
BROUGHT SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND
BUZZ TO THE G.O.P. LANDSCAPE LO
THOSE MANY HOURS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
AS OF TUESDAY NIGHT, MICHELE
BACHMANN'S WIN AND RICK PERRY'S
JOLT OF EXCITEMENT BELONG TO THE
AGES.
SQUIRREL.
>> SO DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE
FIELD, OR ARE WE WAITING FOR
PAUL RYAN?
>> ARE WE GOING TO SEE SOME
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE PAUL RYAN?
>> SOMEBODY WHO CAN MAYBE APPEAL
TO MODERATE VOTERS, PAUL RYAN.
>> HE'S VERY YOUNG AT 41.
>> BUT HE HAS IDEAS.
>> I HOPE HE RETURNS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THAT WAS ALL FROM
TODAY.
WHY IS THAT?
IT'S NEVER ENOUGH FOR THE MEDIA.
THEY'RE LIKE CHILDREN.
"MOM, CAN I GET A PAUL RYAN?"
"I JUST GOT YOU A RICK PERRY,
AND YOU ALREADY BROKE YOUR
MICHELE BACHMANN."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OH, AND BEFORE I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE, WHERE THE
[BLEEPED] IS YOUR RON PAUL?
[LAUGHTER]
AND DON'T TELL ME HE'S NO FUN TO
PLAY WITH.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT LIKE DURING
THOSE TWO DAYS WITH RICK PERRY.
WE DIDN'T HAVE SOME GOOD TIMES.
>> PERRY COMES FROM THE RADICAL
COUNTRY CLUB THAT LOVES TO
REMIND WHITE AMERICA PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS OTHER, NOT LIKE YOU.
>> GETTING AMERICA BACK TO WORK
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT
FACES THIS COUNTRY.
BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF $14.5 OR
$16 TRILLION WORTH OF DEBT, THAT
BIG, BLACK CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER
AMERICA.
>> THAT BLACK CLOUD PERRY IS
TALKING ABOUT IS PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: WAIT.
WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
PRETTY SURE PERRY WAS SAYING THE
BLACK CLOUD IS THE DEBT.
IN FACT, IF YOU KEEP THE SOUND
BITE GOING...
>> THAT BIG, BLACK CLOUD THAT
HANGS OVER AMERICA, THAT DEBT.
>> Jon: SEE.
"THAT DEBT."
AND WHILE THE NEXT DAY ED
SCHULTZ DID APOLOGIZE FOR NOT
PLAYING THE WHOLE CLIP, HE NEVER
ADDRESSED HIS INSINUATION ABOUT
WHAT PERRY MEND WITH THE PHRASE
"BLACK CLOUD OVER AMERICA."
BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT BLACK CLOUDS.
