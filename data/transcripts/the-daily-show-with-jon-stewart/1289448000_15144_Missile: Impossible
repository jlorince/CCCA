COINCIDENTALLY HIS BOOK CAN ALSO
BE USED AS A FOREIGN OBJECT.
FROM TIME TO TIME I LIKE TO
CHECK IN WITH THE LOCAL NEWS IN
LOS ANGELES HOPING TO REINFORCE
MY VOW TO NEVER EVER LIVE THERE.
HOW IS IT GOING OUT THERE?
>> MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
WITH A MYSTERY MISSILE LAUNCH
LAST NIGHT OWE OFF THE SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA COAST.
>> Jon: THAT'S A NEW REASON TO
ADD TO MY LIST.
LET'S SEE:  EARTHQUAKES, WILD
FIRES, MUD SLIDES HOLLYWOOD
D-BAGS UNIDENTIFIED INCOMING
MISSILES.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE STORIES THAT
AT FIRST BLUSH SEEMS MISS MYSTERIOUS
BUT IT HAS A BENAL NOT NEWS
WORTHY RESOLUTION.
IN OTHER WORDS CATNIP.
TAKE IT, BOYS.

>> A MISSILE WAS LAUNCHED OFF
THE CALIFORNIA COAST LAST NIGHT.
A MYSTERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH.
IS IT A MISSILE?
WHAT IS IT?
>> SOMEBODY KNOWS.
WHOEVER LAUNCHED IT HAS TO KNOW.
>> Jon: SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
HAS OR HAS IN THE LAUNCHED A
MISSILE OR IN THE A MISSILE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND BELIEVE ME WHOEVER DID OR
DID NOT DO THIS THEY KNOW WHO
THEY ARE OR ARE NOT.
BATMAN TO THE YELLOW PAGES.

MONTAGE.
>> WE HAVE CALLED EVER MILITARY
BUSINESS IN THE WESTERN REGION.
WE'VE CALLED NORAD,.
>> WE'VE CALLED THE NAVY, THE
AIR FORCE, THE PENTAGON, LOCAL
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, NO ONE KNEW
ANYTHING.
>> WE'RE GETTING NO ANSWERS FROM
ALL THE DIFFERENT DEMOCRATS OF
GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE
CUTTING THROUGH THE BUREAUCRACY
TO FIND OUT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED TAKES
LONGER THAN AN HOUR-LONG CABLE
NEWS SHIFT.
WHILE WE'RE WAITING --
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A
LAUNCH FROM A SUBMARINE.
>> A MISSILE FROM A NAVY SHIP.
>> IT COULD BE A SECRET TEST?
>> A RUSSIAN SUB?
>> A COMMERCIAL LAUNCH.
>> OPTICAL ILLUSION.
>> MAYBE EVEN A U.S.
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
MISSILE.
>> SEELY HIGHLY UNDERCOVER
OPERATION.
>> WHAT ELSE COULD DO THAT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: A GIANT SKY (bleep).
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ARE YOU EVEN ALLOWED TO SHOW
THAT ON TELEVISION?
[LAUGHTER]
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS, A MISSILE
LAUNCH OFF THE COAST OF
CALIFORNIA JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE
ACTION HERO GOVERNOR IS SET TO
RETIRE.
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS
GOVERNOR ARNOLD SWAGZ EGG INNER
IN MISSILE TOES.
DON'T DO IT, GOVERNOR, YOU ONLY
HAVE TWO WEEKS UNTIL RETIREMENT
AND THERE'S A 100% CHANCE OF
DEATH.
>> AND THEY TOLD ME A MAN
COULDN'T GET PREGNANT, BUT I
DID.
I HAD THAT BABY AND THAT BABY
WAS DANNY DE VITO.
>> MR. GOVERNOR YOU ARE
CONFUSING YOUR MOVIES.
>> WE DON'T HAVE TIME.
NOW STRAP ME TO A FASTER MISSILE
SO I CAN CATCH UP TO THE SLOWER
MISSILE AND BLOW THEM BOTH UP
FALLING TO SAFETY ON A DO YOU
KNOW IN THE ARIZONA DESERT.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY --
[LAUGHTER]
-- WE DO A LOT OF IMPROVE --
IMPROV OF THE SHOW.
MAYBE THE HELICOPTER COULD SHOT
THE VIDEO COULD ANSWER THE
QUESTIONS.
>> IT WAS A PLUME RISING UP FROM
WHAT LOOKED LIKE BEYOND THE
HORIZON.
IT CONTINUED TO GROW.
>> HE ZOOMED IN AND STAYED ON IT
FOR TEN MINUTES.
TO HIM IT LOOKS LIKE AN INCOMING
MISSILE.
>> Jon: DID YOU SAY TEN
MINUTES?
[LAUGHTER]
AN INCOMING MISSILE THAT HE WAS
ABLE TO TRACK FOR TEN MINUTES?
DON'T MISSILES TRAVEL LIKE
18,000 MILES PER HOUR SNL.
[LAUGHTER]
SO TEN MINUTES IN MISSILE TIME
IS 3,000 MILES.
IF IT WAS A MISSILE, WOULDN'T IT
BE IN (bleep) HAWAII BY THEN?
[LAUGHTER]
MAYBE THIS MISSILE THING ISN'T
ACTUALLY A MISSILE.
>> LOOKS LIKE THE AIRCRAFT UP
HIGH AND STILL IN THE SUNLIGHT.
>> IF I WERE TO PUT MONEY ON THE
TABLE, I WOULD PUT MONEY ON AN
AIRPLANE.
>> Jon: SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE.
[LAUGHTER]
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT FROM
SOMEONE WITH A DOG ON THEIR LAP.
>> MILITARY MISSILE EXPERT
BELIEVES IT'S AN AIRPLANE,
LIKELY A JUMBO JET.
>> Jon: SOLD TO THE MAN USING
A LABRADOODLE AS A BONER SHIELD.
PROBLEM SEEMINGLY SOLVED.
THE NEWS MEDIA IS GOING TO FEEL
PRETTY SILLY FREAKING OUT OVER
THIS AND WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE
GOING TO BLAME.
THE PENTAGON HAD 24 HOURS TO
INVESTIGATE THIS VIDEO.
WHY CAN'T THEY SAY THIS WAS A
JET PLUME?
>> THEY HESITATED AND HESITATED.
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
TOLD IT WAS NOT A SECRET BLACK
OPERATION THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
IN THE HESITATION THEY PROVIDED
THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
>> Jon: ARE YOU EXTOWARDING
THE PENTAGON.
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING BUT AH,
YOU DON'T GET BACK TO ME FRONT
FRONT -- PRONTO I'M GOING TO
START SAYING CRAZY (bleep).
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

>> JON, JON --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- ALL SEEMS CLEAR FOR NOW
TONIGHT.
ANGELONS CAN REST EASY.
>> Jon: WHY IS IT EVERYONE HAD
TO LIVE IN FEAR FOR A FEW HOURS?
IT WAS LIKE THE NUCLEAR
ARMAGEDDON VERSION OF THE
BALLOON BOY EPISODE?
>> ARE YOU SAYING THERE WAS A
POSSIBILITY OF A BOY BIG SRAFLD
IN THIS?
A MISSILE BOY, IF WILL YOU?
I'VE GOT BREAKING NEWS THAT I'M
ASSUMING ANYONE I CALL WILL
NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY,
THERE'S A BOY ATTACHED TO THE
MISSILE.
SOMEONE IN SPACE THERE'S A BOY
RIDING A MISSILE.
>> Jon: IT'S LIKE BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO FILL AIRTIME THE NORMAL
BACKGROUNDWORK IS JUST SHOWN ON
THE AIR.
ANSWERS HAVE TO COME QUICKER
THAN ANSWERS EVER DO.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
YOU'VE GOT TO RUN BEFORE YOU CAN
WALK.
>> Jon: NO, WYATT, THEY SAY

SKY.
IT'S DROPPING QUICKLY INTO THE
SEA THREATENING TO PLUNGE THE
EARTH INTO PERMANENT DARKNESS.
THE PENTAGON SAID WAIT UNTIL

HUMAN FEET IS TERRORIZING CANAL
STREET.
