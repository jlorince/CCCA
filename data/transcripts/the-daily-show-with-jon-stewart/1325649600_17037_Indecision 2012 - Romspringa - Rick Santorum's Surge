(LAUGHTER)
BUT THAT'S IT!
ROMSPRINGA'S OVER.
YOU WENT THROUGH EVERYBODY.
YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO ROMNEY.
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE.
UNLESS... OH, LORD, PLEASE, NO.
>> SANTORUM HAS CAUGHT FIRE.
HIS EVENTS NOW OVERFLOWING WITH
SUPPORTERS.
>> HE'S HAD A METEORIC RISE.
>> A SANTORUM SURGE.
>> SANTORUM WAS CONSIDERED THE
LONGEST OF LONG SHOTS.
HE NOW HAS A CHANCE OF WINNING
THE IOWA CAUCUSES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: GET THE (BLEEP) OUT OF
HERE!
(LAUGHTER)
SANTORUM.
REALLY?
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TRY
EVERY CHOCOLATE IN THE BOX?
LOOK, LOOK, HERE'S YOUR
CANDIDATES, LET'S CALL IT A
WHITEMAN'S SAMPLER.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU GOT THEM ALL IN THERE?
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THE
PLAIN CHOCOLATE.
YOU'RE GONNA.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA END
UP.
YOU JUST ARE.
YOU TRIED TO BACHMANN OVER HERE,
TOO MANY NUTS.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
NO GOOD.
PERRY.
OH, THE PERRY LOOKS GREAT.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
CAN YOU GET THE PERRY OVER HERE?
OH, LOOK AT THE PERRY.
THAT LOOKS GREAT.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
ALMOND NOUGAT.
WHO PUTS ALMOND NOUGAT IN
CHOCOLATE?
YOU TRIED ALL OF THEM.
ALL OF THEM EXCEPT THIS ONE.
THIS IS THE ONE YOU NEVER TRIED
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SUCKS.
THIS ONE?
THAT'S SANTORUM.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S THE ONE THAT HAS THE CHERRY
(BLEEP) ON THE INSIDE.
THE ONE YOU TRY AND PAWN OFF ON
ONE OF YOUR COUSINS.
LOOK AT THIS, LOOK.
LOOK AT THIS.
SEE IT?
LOOK AT THIS (BLEEP) OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!
MY CHOCOLATE WAS ALIVE AND NOW
IT'S BLEEDING!
SO THIS IS THE ONE YOU'RE
GETTING.
YOU'RE GETTING ROMNEY IN THE
END.
THE LITTLE MESSENGER BOY.
THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT THAT.
HE'S GOT SOME SANTORUM ON HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS
TO CLEAN UP WHEN YOU'VE GOT
SANTORUM ON YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DO
NOT GOOGLE THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THAT'S IT.
YOU END UP WITH ROMNEY, THE
LEAST BAD CHOCOLATE.
AND, BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU DO
ULTIMATELY END UP WITH ROMNEY,
DON'T TRY AND PRETEND THIS IS
THE CHOCOLATE YOU WANTED THE
WHOLE TIME.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISERABLE,
NOT BECAUSE ROMNEY FLIP-FLOPS OR
PRETENDS HE'S AN ORDINARY FELLOW
TRYING TO MAKE IN THE THIS
BLUE-COLLAR WORLD, BUT BECAUSE
ROMNEY'S GOOD IDEAS REEK OF JOHN
KERRYESQUE OUT OF TOUCHEDNESS.
DID YOU WATCH THE COVERAGE OF
TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YEAR'S EVE?
DID YOU SEE MITT ROMNEY BOUGHT
THE SPACE BEHIND THE BALL IN
TIMES SQUARE.
THAT'S SMART.
MAKES PERFECT BUSINESS SENSE.
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR BUSINESS
IS GETTING PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S LIKE THOSE ADS RIGHT ABOVE
URINALS.
YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS "THAT'S A
GREAT IDEA, PEOPLE CAN'T GO
ANYWHERE, THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT
IT."
THEN YOUR SECOND THOUGHT IS "I
HATE WHOEVER THE (BLEEP) PUT
THIS HERE."
(LAUGHTER)
SO THAT'S YOUR GUY.
EAT UP.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
