>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SIMEONE. BALDWIN PROFESSOR OF
LAW EMERITUS AT YALE UNIVERSITY.ALSO AN AUTHOR,
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WHYGOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN AND
HOW IT CAN DO BETTER."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMPETER SCHUCK.
SIR, HOW ARE YOU?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THIS, THIS, THIS, THIS, WHYGOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN AND
HOW WE CAN DO BETTER.
WHY IS THIS NOT MORE A PART OFTHE NATIONAL CONVERSATION?
WHY DO YOU THINK THE NATIONALCONVERSATION IS SO TIED UP IN
CONFLICT AND PARTISAN RHETORICAND NOT THE BUSINESS OF
GOVERNANCE?
>> WELL, A FEW REASONS.
ONE REASON IS THAT PEOPLE WOULDRATHER TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY WISH
WOULD HAPPEN, HOW THE WORLDSHOULD BE, RATHER THAN THE WAY
IT ACTUALLY IS, THE WAY IT WORKSOUT IN REALITY.
MOST OF US ARE LIKE THAT.
SECONDLY, THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'TWANT TO KNOW IN MANY CASES WHY
IT'S PROGRAMS DO SO POORLY.
>> Jon: DO THEY HAVE -- WHATARE THE MECHANISMS OF GOVERNMENT
TO ASSESS THAT?
WHAT ARE THE METRICS THEY USEAND WHAT DO THEY EVEN DO TO
ASSESS IT?
>> THERE'S A FEW AGENCIES LIKETHE GAO AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
OFFICE AND INSPECTORS GENERAL OFVARIOUS
DEPARTMENTS, THEY DO PERIODICASSESSMENTS OF PROGRAMS BUT ONLY
WHEN CONGRESS ASKS THEM TO DOTHAT OR DIRECTS THEM TO DO THAT.
THEY HAVE A VARIETY OFMETHODOLOGIES, COST
EFFECTIVENESS IS USUALLY THEMAJOR CRITERION.
>> Jon: AND, ARE THOSE FINDINGSUSUALLY UTILIZED? ARE THEY
IMPLEMENTED? WHAT'S THE RESULTOF THAT?
>> THEY'RE PUBLISHED. WHETHERTHEY'RE UTILIZED OR NOT.
>> Jon: THEY'RE JUST PUBLISHED.
[LAUGHTER]WELL THAT'S VERY LOVELY.
>> LIKE MY BOOK.
>> Jon: EXACTLY YOUR BOOK ISPUBLISHED.
IT'S PERFECT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WHAT YOU DID WHICH IS LONG
OVERDUE IS YOU TRY TO FIND A WAYTO ATTACH VALUE TO THESE
PROGRAMS. YOU HEAR FROM -- ITHINK FOR PEOPLE WHO STILL
BELIEVE GOVERNMENT HAS ANIMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN
IMPROVING PEOPLES LIVES ANDTHEN WE WATCH THEM NOT BE ABLE
TO DO THE SIMPLEST OF TASKS LIKEPROCESS VETERAN HEALTH
CLAIMS IN AN EFFICIENT WAYIS DISHEARTENING.
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE YOUHAVE PEOPLE JUST SAY, WELL IT'S
TOO BIG AND YOU HAVE TO CUTMONEY WITHOUT ATTACHING BIGNESS
OR MONEY TO ANY VALUE THAT ITMAY BE PROVIDED.
>> RIGHT, WELL YOU HAD A SEGMENTI THINK LAST WEEK ABOUT THE V.A.
AND THE COVERUP THAT OCCURREDAFTER IT WAS REVEALED. ALTHOUGH,
PEOPLE WHO WATCH THESE THINGSHAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME
THE V.A. BACKLOGS ARE TERRIBLE.
REALLY TERRIBLE.
THEY ARE REDUCED AND ONCE THEYARE REDUCED IT'S LIKE A HIGHWAY.
YOU REDUCE CONGESTION AND MOREPEOPLE COME ON.
>> Jon: WHY DO THEY HAVE SUCHTROUBLE REFORMING CLEARLY
FAILING OR INEFFICIENT SYSTEMS?
IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR TO A LOT OFPEOPLE.
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THESEPROGRAMS CAN FIND LOTS OF
REASONS TO THINK THAT THEY ARESUCCEEDING AND THERE
ARE ALWAYS LOTS OF INTERESTS WHOWANT THEM TO DO MORE OF THE
SAME. SO IT REQUIRES PEOPLE,LIKE ME, AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO
WILL ACTUALLY GO ANDLOOK AT THE DATA REALLY
CAREFULLY AND MAKE SOMEJUDGMENTS ABOUT WHETHER IT
WORKS OR NOT.
>> Jon: YOU MENTIONED THEHOMESTEAD ACT AS A PROGRAM THAT
WAS COST EFFICIENT, YOU KNOW,
A RESOURCE WAS GIVEN BY THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO A GROUP OF
PEOPLE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSEAND THAT HELPED US SETTLE THE
WEST. SO, THAT IS CONSIDEREDA SUCCESS.
>> WELL, THAT WAS A RELATIVELYEASY CASE BECAUSE THE LAND WAS
BASICALLY FREE EXCEPTFOR THE INDIANS WHO
HAPPENED TO LIVE THERE AND WEREMASSACRED ALONG THE WAY.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> Jon: I'M SURE ON THEIR "THEDAILY SHOW" THEY ARE HAVING A
VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. [LAUGHTER]
>> THAT WAS RELATIVELY EASY. ITDIDN'T COST
ANYBODY ANYTHING REALLY EXCEPTFOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS.
>> Jon: YOU COULD REALLY JUSTEND EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT
THIS COUNTRY WITH THATPHRASE, BY THE WAY.
SO IT WORKED OUT,
EXCEPT FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING A LITTLE
WONKIER SOCIAL SECURITY?
>> SOCIAL SECURITY HAS BEEN ASUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BUT IT'S
GOING INSOLVENT.
FORTUNATELY WITH SOCIAL SECURITYTHERE ARE A LOT OF RELATIVELY
STRAIGHTFORWARD FIXES THAT COULDBE DONE.
YOU CAN EXTEND THE RETIREMENTAGE, YOU CAN TAX UPPER INCOME
RECIPIENTS.
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
>> Jon: YES, EXACTLY. KICK ITIN, BABY I'M READY.
>> BUT, YOU ARE NOT 65 YET.
SO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHATIS GOING ON INSIDE MY BODY.
I'M ABOUT 93.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> YOU CAN INCREASE THE WAGES
THAT ARE TAXABLE.
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO DO IT.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE A SENSETHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS
A MORE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OFTHESE PROGRAMS OR THERE HAS TO
BE A MORE FUNDMENTAL CHANGE INTHE WAY WE VIEW THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY?
>> I THINK IT'S BOTH.
IT'S NOT JUST ACTIVE MANAGEMENT.
THE MANAGEMENT IS OFTEN VERYINTERIOR. OUR BUREAUCRACY
HAS BEEN DEBASEDAND DEGRADED OVER TIME. IT HAS
A TERRIBLE MORALE PROBLEM.MUCH MORE SO THAN IT USED TO.
>> Jon: BUT, THAT'S A MANAGEMENTPROBLEM MORE THAN IT IS, YOU
KNOW, THE PEOPLE I TALKTO IN THE BUREAUCRACY
ARE GENERALLY PRETTY GOODHEARTED, PRETTY MUCH WANT TO
DO THE RIGHT THING BUT DON'THAVE THE MARCHING ORDERS.
>> BUT THAT'S PART OF THEPROBLEM.
THERE'S BEEN MUCH MORE LAYERINGOF POLITICAL APPOINTEES ON TOP
OF THEM TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENTTHAN IN THE PAST. SO,
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAMEKIND OF AUTONOMY, THE SAME
SORT OF SENSE OF MISSIONTHEY USED TO.
IN THE BOOK I DISCUSS A NUMBEROF STUDIES
THAT HAVE INTERVIEWED THEM ANDHAVE DONE A VARIETY OF TESTS TO
SEE HOW THIS BUREAUCRACY ISFUNCTIONING.
IT'S IN DEEP CRISIS.
>> Jon: WE'RE IN THE DEEPCRISIS.
WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OFCOLLAPSE. WE'RE GOING
TO COMMERCIAL, YOU'LL BE ON THEWEB AND YOU'RE GOING
TO TELL US HOW TO FIX IT ANDYOU'LL HAVE THREE MINUTES.
WHY GOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN.
THIS IS THE BOOK.
THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THATTHE NEWS NETWORKS I THINK
SHOULD BE HAVING.
>> THEY DON'T.
>> Jon: YEAH, NO. I KNOW.
PETER SCHUCK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
