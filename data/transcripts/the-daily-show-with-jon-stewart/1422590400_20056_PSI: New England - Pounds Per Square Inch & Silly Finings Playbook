>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
GREAT SHOW TONIGHT!
MY GUEST SARAH CHAYES, SHEIS THE AUTHOR OF "THIEVES OF
STATE," A BOOK ON CORRUPTION ANDGLOBAL SECURITY.
IT'S A TREMENDOUS BOOK.
BUT LET'S BEGIN WITH THIS COMINGSUNDAY,
APPARENTLY KATY PERRY IS HAVINGA CONCERT SUNDAY THAT WILL HAVE
SOME SORT OF ATHLETIC INTRO ANDOUTRO.
IT'S THE SUPER BOWL, THATSPECIAL TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE
WHOLE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER TO
WATCH DOGS FALL IN LOVE WITHHORSES!
(LAUGHTER)IT'S A FORBIDDEN LOVE!
BUT A SHADOW HANGS OVER THISYEAR'S MATCHUP BETWEEN THE
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS AND THEPATRIOTS OF ENGLAND NOUVEAU.
>> THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS AREFIGHTING BACK AGAINST
ACCUSATIONS OFUNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT.
>> 11 OF THE 12 BALLS USED TOBEAT THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS WERE
INFLATED SIGNIFICANTLYBELOW LEAGUE REQUIREMENTS.
>> DEFLATEGATE.
>> BALLGHAZI!
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE
ARE THE APPROPRIATE NICKNAMESFOR SOMETHING THIS SERIOUS.
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THEBALLOCAUST.
FLAGRANT EQUIPMENT TAMPERING!
RAISING QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHERTHE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS'S 45 TO
7 BLOWOUT WIN OVER THE COLTS WASDUE TO CHEATING, AND WITHOUT
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE,YOU KNOW, 38-7.
OBVIOUSLY A DEFLATED BALL WOULDBE A LITTLE EASIER TO THROW AND
CATCH ESPECIALLY ININCLEMENT WEATHER.
THE PATRIOTS WERE QUICK TODENY THESE ACCUSATIONS.
COACH BILL BELICHICK BROUGHT THESCIENCE TO BACK IT UP.
>> WE ALL KNOW THAT AIR PRESSUREIS A FUNCTION OF THE ATMOSPHERIC
CONDITIONS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: SCIENCE! YEAH!
I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE,THOUGH, BUT FOR ONLY ONE TEAM?
>> IT'S SIMILAR TO THE CONCEPTOF WHEN YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR
AND THE LIGHT COMES ON AND ITSAYS LOW TIRE PRESSURE BECAUSE
THE CAR'S BEEN SITTING IN THEDRIVEWAY OUTSIDE OVERNIGHT.
THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS ASWELL AS THE TRUE EQUILIBRIUM OF
THE BALL IS CRITICAL TO THEMEASUREMENT.
>> Jon: THIS CONCLUDES THEFIRST EPISODE OF PROFESSOR
BELICHICK'S MADEUP (BLEEP)SPORTS PHYSICS 101.
COME BACK NEXT WEEK! WE'LLTALK ABOUT HOW THE SPEED OF THE
EARTH'S CENTRIFUGAL FORCEAFFECTS THE SPECIFIC
GRAVITY OF COIN TOSSES, NOT THETWO-HEADED COIN WE HAVE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT IF COACH BILL BELICHICK IS
NOT THE CULPRIT, PERHAPS WE NEEDLOOK NO FURTHER THAN HIS
PADAWAN, LUKE SKY TOSSER, AKAHANDSOME MCGURK.
>> YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T ALTER THEBALL IN ANY WAY.
BEFORE EVERY GAME I GO IN ANDPICK THE BALLS THAT I WANT TO,
THE FOOTBALLS THAT I WANT TOUSE FOR THE GAME.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TOUCHING THEBALLS AFTER THAT.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE RUBBINGTHEM, YOU KNOW, PUTTING ANY AIR
IN THEM, TAKING ANY AIR OUT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
BE HIDING ONE UNDER MY HAT.
(LAUGHTER)I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE PUTTING A
THIN ELECTROMAGNETIC CHIP ON THEBALL THAT'S SYNCED UP WITH THE
RECEIVER'S METALLIC HANDIMPLANTS EITHER OR A
PERHAPS TRAINING A HAMSTER TOLIVE INSIDE THE BALL
AND PILOT IT TOWARD MY STARRECEIVER CELERY HANDS JOHNSON.
C'MON!
A SUPERSTAR LIKE BRADY DOESN'TNEED TO CHEAT!
WHAT WOULD EVEN GIVE YOU THEIMPRESSION THAT HE LIKES TO USE
DEFLATED BALLS?
>> WHEN GRONK SCORES, IT WASLIKE HIS EIGHTH TOUCHDOWN OF THE
YEAR HE SPIKES THE BALL AND HEDEFLATES THE BALL WHICH I
LOVE THAT BECUASE, YOU KNOW, ILIKE THE DEFLATED BALL.
>> Jon: YOU BASTARD!
AND TO THINK WE TRUSTED YOU WITHONE OF OUR BRAZILIANIST MODELS.
BUT IF IT'S NOT BELICHICK ORBRADY AND IT'S BOTH, THEN HOW
DID ONLY THE PATRIOTS' BALLSBECOME DEFLATED?
>> THE PATRIOTS LOCKER ROOMATTENDANT IS SEEN ON
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TAKINGPRE-INSPECTED FOOTBALLS INTO A
PRIVATE BATHROOM.
>> THE DEBATE OVER DEFLATEGATEMAY BOIL DOWN TO WHETHER YOU
BELIEVE A LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANTFOR THE PATRIOTS COULD
HAVE INTENTIONALLY DEFLATED 12FOOTBALLS IN LESS THAN
90 SECONDS IN THE LEASTLIKELY OF PLACES.
>> THE LEAST LIKELY OF PLACES?
IT'S A BATHROOM!
NOT MT. KILIMANJARO!
HE DEFLATED THEM INSIDE ASUMATRAN RHINO'S ANUS!
(LAUGHTER)WELL THERE YOU GO.
THERE'S EVIDENCE ON TAPE. ITWAS THE LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANT!
DRUNK ON HIS OWN POWER!
HIGH ON AUTHORITY!
ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTSABSOLUTELY.
FIRST, I'LL HAVE EACH ONE OFTHESE 53 FOOTBALL MEN THROW
THEIR SOILED UNIFORMS AT MEWITHOUT MAKING EYE CONTACT DAY
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY!
AND THEN I WILL ALTER THE VERYCOURSE OF THE GAME ON MY OWN FOR
NO EXTRA MONEY.
(LAUGHTER)BLAME ME!
NOW, OF COURSE, THEY HAVE VIDEOEVIDENCE BUT THIS BEING THE
N.F.L. MY GUESS IS THEY WON'TTRY TO FIND THE TAPE FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS.
PERHAPS, PERHAPS WE SHOULD TAKEA LOOK AT IT.
ALL RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE THEPATRIOTS' ATTENDANT IS CARRYING
THE BALLS INTO WHAT APPEARS TOBE AN ELEVATOR.
EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE.
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HAVING AGOOD TIME.
OKAY, THE ELEVATOR'SGOING -- NOW THEY'RE EXITING.
WHERE'S THE BALL -- OH, MY GOD!
WHAT HAPPENED?
THOSE BALLS DO NOT APPEAR TO BEIN A PLAYABLE STATE.
THAT'S JUST AWFUL.
THE WORST PART IS EVEN WITH THETAPE YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST GOING
TO END WITH A PRESS CONFERENCEWHERE THE BALLS HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THEIR ROLE INBEING DEFLATED AND BRADY WALKS
AWAY SCOT-FREE.
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, JOHN!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DON'T, DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY
TOM BRADY LIKE THAT!
YOU NEW YORK CITY PIZZA STYLE(BLEEP)!
>> Jon: JOHN, SINCE WHEN ARE YOUA PATRIOTS FAN?
>> SINCE I WAS BORN INNEW ENGLAND.
>> Jon: YES.
>> CAN'T YOU HEAR MY WICKEDBOSTON ACCENT?
I PARKED MY CAR IN THE YARD ATHARVARD.
>> Jon: HARVARD YARD?
>> WHAT? NO, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.YARD.
>> YARD?>> YARRRD. YARRRD.
>> Jon: NEVERMIND. AS A DIEHARD PATRIOTS FAN,
WHY ARE YOU HOLDING WHAT APPEARSTO BE A BASEBALL BAT?
>> NO, WHAT ARE YOU TALKINGABOUT?
THIS IS MY FOOTBALL MALLET.
>> Jon: A MALLET? AS -- YOU KNOWWHAT, FORGET IT.
JOHN, ARE THOSE BY ANY CHANCELEG WARMERS OVER HOCKEY PANTS?
IS THAT --
>> YEAH, WHAT -- OKAY, JON,MAYBE I'M NOT A FOOTBALL EXPERT
LIKE YOU.
MAYBE I THINK IT'S A STUPID GAMEFOR DUMB PEOPLE.
BUT AS A BORN AND BREDBOSTONIAN, I KNOW THAT NO ONE
IS BETTER THAN TOM BRADY ATGRABBING A BALL AND PUSHING IT
ACROSS THE FOOTBALL TABLE INTOTHE SCORE SPACE!
GOOOOOOOOOAL!
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,JOHN.
>> GOOOOOOAL!>> Jon: GOAL.
>> OH, OH, JOHN. I AM GOING TOMISS "DOWNTON ABBEY."
I'VE GOT TO GO. BYE BYE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE.JOHN HODGMAN EVERYBODY,
VERY NICE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,DEFLATEGATE WAS ALL
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUTAT THE SUPER BOWL MEDIA DAY.
THAT IS, IF THEY WERE TALKING,
>> WELL, SEAHAWKS RUNNING BACKMARSHAWN LYNCH, NOT A BIG FAN OF
MEDIA DAY.
LYNCH SAT AT HIS PODIUM AND KEPTREPEATING THIS:
>> I'M HERE SO I WON'T GETFINED.
I'M HERE SO I WON'T GET FINED.
I'M JUST HERE SO I WON'T GETFINED.
>> SO HE SAID THAT 29 TIMES,AND THEN GOT UP AND LEFT AFTER
THE MANDATORY FOUR AND A HALFMINUTES.
>> Jon: POOR MARSHAWN LYNCH,HE'S MORE VINE THAN MAN NOW.
>> I'M HERE SO I WON'T GETFINED.
I'M HERE SO I WON'T GET FINED.
I'M HERE SO I WON'T GET FINED.
I'M HERE SO I WON'T GET FINED.
I'M HERE SO I WON'T GET FINED.
>> Jon: SEEMS LIKE A LONG WAYTO GO TO AVOID PAYING A FINE.
WHY EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP TOMEDIA?
>> HE WAS REPORTEDLY LOOKINGAT A $500,000 FINE.
>> Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDINGME?
THAT'S MY COMPANY POURED DIOXININ A RIVER MONEY.
$500,000?
HOW IS IT THAT THIS GUY ISFACING INTERNATIONAL DRUG CARTEL
PENALTY MONEY BUT THE OWNERS ANDCOMMISSIONERS OF THE LEAGUE
HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO ADDRESSSTADIUM FINANCING SHENANIGANS
OR CONCUSSIONS OR DOMESTICVIOLENCE POLICIES.
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS THESTUPIDEST ITERATION OF THE
NFL'S [BLEEP] UP PRIORITIES.
>> THE LEAGUE MAY PENALIZE LYNCHFOR WEARING HIS BEAST MODE HAT
THE LAST TWO DAYS.
IT'S AGAINST NFL RULES TOPROMOTE YOUR OWN BRAND OR BRANDS
THAT CONFLICT WITH LEAGUEPARTNERS DURING INTERVIEWS.
>> Jon: OH, YOU WILL GO TOTHAT INTERVIEW, MISTER, AND YOU
WILL WEAR AN APPROPRIATE HAT!
IS THIS THE N.F.L.?
AS THE PRINCIPAL IN THEBREAKFAST CLUB?
TWO FINES, LYNCH!
YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE?
YOU PUT ON THE BEAST MODE HAT,YOU GET THE HORNS!
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST CLASSICN.F.L. TO BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON TOPOF THE PLAYER'S HEAD
THAN THE DAMAGE THAT'S GOINGON INSIDE IT.
IT EXPLAINS THEIR SLOGAN, THENATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE:
WORRYING ABOUT THE WRONG (BLEEP)SINCE 1920.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
