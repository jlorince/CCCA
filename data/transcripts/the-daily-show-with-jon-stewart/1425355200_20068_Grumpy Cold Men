[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: BOOM! BOOM!
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAN.
WE ARE ON FIRE TONIGHT.
AS YOU KNOW, OUR -- AS YOU KNOW,OUR LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM RUNS ON
COMMITTEES. YOU KNOW THAT.
EVERY COMMITTEE IN OUR CONGRESSIS RUN BY A CHAIRPERSON.
NOW THE QUESTION THEN COMES UPHOW DOES ONE REACH THIS POSITION
OF RESPONSIBILITY.
MERIT?
HA.
[LAUGHTER]GOOD ONE, TELEPROMPTER.
NO.
SENATE CHAIRMANSHIPS AREOVERWHELMINGLY AWARDED
BY SENIORITY.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THEINSTITUTION THE LONGEST GET TO
BE IN CHARGE, JUST LIKE INORPHANAGES.
IT'S WHY KANSAS SENTAOR PATROBERTS GOT TO CHAIR THE
SENATE'S COMMITTEE ONAGRICULTURE, NUTRITION,
FORESTRY DESPITE DISTRUSTINGNUTRITION PROGRAMS.
AND WHY ARIZONA'S JOHN MCCAINHEADS ARMED SERVICES DESPITE
WANTING TO INVADE EVERYONE,EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME.
AND WHY BEDFORD FALLS MR. POTTERIS IN CHARGE OF BANKING.
I'M SURE HE'LL BE FAIR.
NOW GIVEN THIS TREND, I CAN'TWAIT TO SEE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF
THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT ANDPUBLIC WORKS.
>> WE KEEP HEARING THAT 2014 HASBEEN THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD.
I ASKED THE CHAIR, DO YOU KNOWWHAT THIS IS?
IT'S A SNOWBALL.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon:  NOW IF IT PLEASES MY
COLLEAGUES, YOU WILL SEE A GROWNMAN MAKE LOVE TO A SNOWBALL.
HERE WE GO. OHHHH -- [LAUGHTER]
OKLAHOMA WHERE THE WINDCOMES WHIPPING DOWN -- SO
SO SENATOR INHOFE, YOU THINKGLOBAL WARMING'S A HOAX BECAUSE
YOU IN FEBRUARY WERE ABLE TOCOLLECT ONE BALL'S WORTH OF
SNOW.
[LAUGHTER]CLEARLY IF GLOBAL WARMING
WAS A PROBLEM, I WOULD ONLY BEABLE TO GRAB LAVA BALLS.
WELL, PLEASE SIR, CONTINUE WITHYOUR SNOW AND TELL.
>> THAT'S JUST FROM OUTSIDEHERE, SO IT'S VERY VERY COLD
OUT, VERY UNSEASONAL SO MR.PRESIDENT CATCH THIS.
>> Jon:  I'M JUST CURIOUS WHATHAPPENED TO THAT SNOWBALL AFTER
INHOFE THREW IT OFF CAMERA.
THAT'S -- HE'S THROWING IT ANDTHEN IT'S JUST, OH MY GOD IT HIT
MADONNA. OH MY GOD.
IT KNOCKED MADONNA OFF STAGE.
YOU MONSTER.
WHY DID YOU KNOCK MADONNA OFFSTAGE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
COUNTRY?
PLEASE TELL ME SENATOR, YOU HAVEMORE THAN JUST ONE OF FROSTY'S
TESTICLES TO BACK UP YOUR2014 ISN'T HOT ARGUMENT.
>> THE GODDARD INSTITUTEOF SPACE STUDIES SAYING THERE'S
ONLY A 38% CHANCE THAT 2014 WASTHE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD.
>> Jon:  RIGHT ON RECORD.
BUT EVEN WITH THE CHANCE ITWASN'T THE NUMBER ONE
HOTTEST YEAR EVER, IT'S PRETTYCLOSE.
IT WAS NOMINATED.
IT WAS A STRONG CONTENDER.
IT WAS AT THE VERY LEAST THE"BOYHOOD" OF THE HOTTEST YEARS
ON RECORD. REALLY THOUGHT THATWAS GOING TO WIN BEST PICTURE.
BUT THAT'S JIM INHOFE.
UNLESS HE'S PERSONALLYWITNESSING SOMETHING,
IT JUST CAN'T BE REAL.
HERE HE IS ON GAY PEOPLE.
>> I'M REALLY PROUD TO SAY THEINDEX RECORDED HISTORY OF OUR
FAMILY, WE'VE NEVER HAD ADIVORCE OR ANY KIND OF
HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIP.
>> Jon:  NOW, THE KEY WORDSTHERE ARE IN THE RECORDED
HISTORY.
[LAUGHTER]MY GUESS IS IF I'M GAY AND I'M
IN THE INHOFE CLAN, I'M NOTWRITING IT DOWN.
SENATOR INHOFE SEEMS TO BEALMOST NEUROLOGICALLY UNABLE TO
UNDERSTAND OR EMPATHIZE WITH ANYEXPERIENCE OUTSIDE OF HIS OWN.
NOW IT COULD BE BECAUSE HEADHERES STRICTLY TO A
FUNDAMENTALIST STRAIN OF JOHNLOCKE STYLE EMPIRICISM,
BELIEVING THAT NOTHING BUT THATWHICH HE HAS PERSONALLY OBSERVED
HAS OCCURRED OR ALTERNATIVELYHE'S A CRAZY OLD [BLEEP].
BUT THERE IS AN OBVIOUS
SOLUTION.
I THINK WITH A NEED TO GIVE JIMINHOFE THE DIRECT EXPERIENCE HE
LACKS. BOTH GLOBALWARMING AND GAYNESS.
FOR THE GOOD OF THECOUNTRY, SOMEBODY HAS TO BLOW
HIM IN THE SENATE'S SAUNA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
