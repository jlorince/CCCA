COMBAT THE INEVITABLE
DIARRHEA, CHA-CHA CHING.
SO THAT IS THE CASE FOR A
HIGHER WAGE.
WHAT IS THE CASE AGAINST.
>> ONLY IN AMERICA CAN OUR
POLITICIANS BEMOAN A LIVABLE
WAGE FOR GETTING ALOT OF
FOLKS WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR
ANY WAGE.
>> PEOPLE ARE NOT IN POVERTY
BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING
MINIMUM WAGE.
>> WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
IS REWARDING MEDIOCRITY.
>> THE FIRST STEP ON THE LAD
CERTIFICATE NOT TO BE
COMFORTABLE.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
HANGING OUT THERE.
SO YOU DOUBLE THE SALARY,
YOU TURN THAT RUNG INTO A
HAMMOCK.
>> EXACTLY.
YOU REMOVE THE INCENTIVE.
IF YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM
WAGE, PEOPLE WILL NEVER STOP
WORKING IN THE FAST-FOOD
INDUSTRY.
THEY'LL GET SO COMFORTABLE
IN THOSE HOT KITCHENS AND IN
THEIR ACRYLIC UNIFORMS,
RELAXING IN THAT GREASE FOG
SELLING LIKE PROCESSED MEAT
NO MATTER HOW MANY SHOWERS
THEY TAKE.
OF COURSE--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IT'S LUXURY.
IT'S LUXURY.
THAT'S HIS POINT.
KIND OF.
OF COURSE HE'S ALSO GOING TO
BE BUSINESS FOR THE SAME
STUPID STUFF ON TELEVISION
INDUSTRY.
WELL, NOT SOME OF AN
INDUSTRY AS A COMPANY.
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
IT-- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IF YOU THINK ABOUTING IT,
THEY ACTUALLY WORK VERY MUCH
ALONG THE LINES OF THE FAST
FOOD BUSINESS MODEL.
THEY SELL YOU SOMETHING THAT
LOOKS APPETIZING BUT LEAVES
YOU FEELING NAUSEOUS FOR
HOURS AFTERWARDS.
AND ANYWAY, IF THESE WORKERS
WANT A RAISE, WHY DON'T THEY
ASK THEIR LIBERAL MESSIAH.
>> WHAT A SAD COMMENTARY IT
IS THAT IN THE OBAMA ECONOMY
WE'RE SITTING AROUND A TABLE
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEGGING
FOR MINIMUM-WAGE INCREASES.
IF THE ECONOMY WERE STRONG,
McDONALD'S WOULD BE PAYING
HIGHER WAGES.
>> YES.
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
CAPITALISM WORKS.
COMPANIES AILES PASS ON
HIGHER PROFITS TO THEIR
LOWER LEVEL WORKERS.
THAT'S A FACT.
THAT'S JUST-- THAT'S HOW THE
SYSTEM OPERATES.
(APPLAUSE)
>> EVERY ONE REMEMBERS HOW
DURING THE ECONOMIC BOON OF
THE 90s FAST FOOD WORKERS
WERE JUST FLINGING PIZZAS
OUT OF THEIR ROLLS-ROYCES.
BUT IT TOOK FOX NEW'S NEIL
CAVUTOO TO LEND THIS
ARGUMENT THE PERSONAL TOUCH.
>> THAT DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE ME.
ANYWAY, WHAT I AM ABOUT TO
SAY ISN'T WHAT WE CALL DEMO
FRIENDLY.
WHEN I WAS A KID WOULD YOU
BE GRATEFUL FOR ANY JOB YOU
COULD FIND.
>> LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.
BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, YOU
DON'T GET TO JOKE THAT
SOUNDING LIKE A CRANKY OLD
MAN IS NOT DEMO FRIENDLY.
BECAUSE YOU MUST BE WELL
AWARE THAT THE MEDIAN AGE OF
THE FOX NEW AUDIENCE IS OVER
65 YEARS OLD.
OR HOW MUCH OLDER?
WELL, NO ONE KNOWS BECAUSE,
AND THIS IS TRUE, NIELSEN
STOPS COUNTING AT 65.
BUT I'M SORRY, YOU WERE
ROMANT SIZING YOUR
CHILDHOOD.
>> ALL I KNOW IS AS SOON AS
I TURNED 16 AND HEARD THAT A
FAST-FOOD CHAIN CALLED
ARTHUR --ERS WAS OPENING A
STORE, I GOT THE JOB.
AND SOON LOCATED TO RELIEF
MANAGER.
THEN WEEKEND MANAGER, THEN
BY THE TENDER AGE OF 16 AND
A HALF YEARS OLD-- FULL-TIME
MANAGER, YEAH, IT'S TRUE.
IT ALL STARTED AT $2 AN HOUR.
>> UNFORTUNATELY WORKING AT
ARTHUR --ERS WAS APPARENTLY
THE LAST JOB NEIL CAVUTOO
WAS ACTUALLY QUALIFIED FOR
BECAUSE HE IS CERTAINLY NOT
QUALIFIED FOR HIS CURRENT
POSITION AS FINANCIAL
ANALYST.
BECAUSE AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED
THE MEDIAN FAST FOOD WORKER
TODAY IS ACTUALLY A
28-YEAR-OLD ADULT, AND NOT A
16-YEAR-OLD NEIL CAVUTO
GETTING HIS FIRST JOB TO
EARN MONEY FOR BEER AND
PORN.
AND-- FURTHER MORE, CAVUTO'S
$2 AN HOUR WAGE IN 1974
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION WOULD
TODAY BE WORTH NEARLY $9.50
WHICH IS MORE THAN $2 MORE
THAN TODAY'S MINIMUM WAGE.
BUT-- IT'S AMAZING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT HE HAS
THE INCENTIVE TO LEAVE THAT
FOR HIS HIGH PAID JOB ON
TELEVISION RIGHT NOW.
