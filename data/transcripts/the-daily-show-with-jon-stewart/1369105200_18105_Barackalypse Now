>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE THE
"DAILY SHOW."
HIGH NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST, PAYING WILL BE
JOINING US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SHE'S, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY HE IS
THE HOST OF THE POPULAR SHOW
"ELLEN."
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S GET TO OUR TOP STORY
TONIGHT AS THOUGH WE WERE A NEWS
ORGANIZATION.
( LAUGHTER )
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN
CRISIS MODE.
HURRICANE SANDY STILL SWIRLING.
THE I.R.S., THE AP, THE BENGHAZI
E-MAILS, JOE BIDEN'S SPRING
BREAK.
OH!
IT'S TIME FOR-- THAT'S NOT EVEN
PHOTOSHOPPED
( LAUGHTER )
IT IS TIME FOR SOME DAMAGE
CONTROL, WHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY
THE ADMINISTRATION SENT OUT
WHOEVER THIS GUY IS.
( LAUGHTER )
TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE
I.R.S. WAS UP TO.
>> NORSHOULD WE.
AS I SAID, THERE IS-- THE I.R.S.
IS AN AGENCY THAT HAS A-- HAS A
HISTORICAL INDEPENDENCE.
FOR VERY GOOD REASONS IN THIS
TOWN, WE-- THE-- THE WHITE HOUSE
AND STAYS AS FAR AWAY FROM THE
I.R.S. AND LETS THEM DO THEIR
BUSINESS.
THE CARDINAL RULE IS YOU DON'T
GET INVOLVED IN AN INDEPENDENT
INVESTIGATION.
>> Jon:  YOU SWEET, SWEET
BOY.
( LAUGHTER )
I KNOW THE CARDINAL RULE IS YOU
DON'T GET INVOLVED, BUT THE
PROBLEM HERE IS THE GAP BETWEEN
INVOLVED IN AND AWARE OF.
IT'S LIKE YOUR KIDS WANT TO MAKE
DINNER FOR YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED.
BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT
THEY'RE DOING IT.
( LAUGHTER )
OR YOU GET STUCK EXPLAINING WHY
YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN.
AND--
( LAUGHTER )
CAN I SAY SOMETHING.
MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT, THE
KIDS, EVEN WHEN THE HOUSE IS ON
FIRE.
THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR SMILE.
"OH, THERE'S A FIRE..."
BY THE WAY, WE WEREN'T THE ONLY
ONES WHO WONDERED WHY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION SENT OUT KEVIN A
OLDER BROTHER FROM "HOME ALONE."
>> I MEAN, THIS IS NO DISRESPECT
TO YOU.
WHY ARE YOU HERE TODAY?
WHY ISN'T THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF
OF STAFF HERE TO TELL US WHAT
HAPPENED?
>> DISPL WHY AM I HERE INSTEAD
OF THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF
STAFF?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
FUNNIER?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOUNG GUY WHO REALLY DOESN'T
KNOW ANSWERING QUESTIONS.
NOT THAT HAVING ACTUAL
EXPLANATIONS FOR THE SCANDAL
WOULD HAVE EVEN MATTERED.
>> THIS IS JUST ROTTEN TO THE
CORE.
THIS IS ARROGANCE.
THIS IS BIG GOVERNMENT CRONYISM.
>> NANNY STATE IS HERE TO TELL
US ALL WHAT TO DO, AND IF WE
START CRITICIZING, YOU GET
TARGETED.
>> ALL THREE OF THESE SCANDALS
MAKES A CLUSTER THAT IMPLIES
SOME VERY BAD THINGS.
>> LITERALLY, THE DECISIONS OF
OUR LIFE AND DEATH MAY VERY WELL
BE IN THE HANDS OF THE I.R.S.
>> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHAT
THE FACTS ARE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  YOU MISSED LAST
BIT.
PLAY THE LAST BIT AGAIN.
JUST GIVE THEM THE LAST BIT
AGAIN.
THEY MISSED THE LAST THING
BECAUSE THEY WERE LAUGHING AT
MICHELLE BACHMAN BECAUSE SHE'S
( BLEEP ) INSANE.
>> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHAT
THE FACTS ARE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:-- HERE'S WHAT I
KNOW-- I I SAID, LIFE AND DEATH.
ARROGANT CLUSTER... LIFE OR
DEATH.
THE FACTS ARE ( BLEEP ).
UN.
( LAUGHTER.
UN YES, THE ADMINISTRATION'S
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS EQUAL
ONLY TO THE REPUBLICANS', AS OF
NOW, FACT-FREE, BONE-DEEP
CERTAINTY AND CONTEMPT.
AND THIS, MY FRIEND.
>> ABC NEWS TRUMPETED AN
EXCLUSIVE STORY THAT PURPORTED
TO REVEAL E-MAILS PROVING THAT
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD MEDDLED WITH
THE BEG TALKING POINTS LAST
SEPTEMBER.
>> PART OF HIS STORY TURNED OUT
TO HAVE BEEN BASED ON AN
INACCURATE SUMMARY OF E-MAILS
THAT MADE THINGS LOOK WORSE FOR
THE WHITE HOUSE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  CAN ANYBODY DO
THEIR JOBS IN THAT TOWN.
?O NOW EVEN THE PRESIDENT IS
MESSING UP.
WE FOUND AN E-MAIL WHERE THE
STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THEY
WANTED TO EDIT IT TO REFLECT
POLITICAL CONCERNS.
OH
