[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, BESTSELLINGAUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED
"THE RULE OF NOBODY: SAVINGAMERICA FROM DEAD LAWS AND
BROKEN GOVERNMENT".
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM PHILIP K. HOWARD.
SIR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
I'M EXCITED WHEN YOU COME BY.
ME AND YOU, WE'RE GOING TO FIXTHIS DAMN,
"THE RULE OF NOBODY: SAVINGAMERICA FROM DEAD LAWS AND
BROKEN GOVERNMENT."
WHENEVER WE TALK, I AM STRUCK BYTHE FACT THAT WHEN I READ YOUR
BOOKS, WHEN I LISTEN TO YOUSPEAK, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF
US AS A NATION OF IDIOTS.
[LAUGHTER]WHAT HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE
PEOPLE OF GOOD INTENTION?
BECAUSE I THINK WE ARE STILL APEOPLE OF GOOD INTENTION.
>> WELL, AT SOME LEVEL DEEP INOUR ID, WE DON'T WANT ANYONE
ELSE TO MAKE A DECISION, SO WETRIED TO CREATE A SYSTEM OF
AUTOMATIC GOVERNMENT WHERECORRECTNESS WOULD BE LAID OUT IN
ADVANCE AND EVERYTHING WOULD BEPERFECT AND NO ONE WOULD BE
UNHAPPY AT THEIR JOBS.
YOU KNOW, AND GOVERNMENT WOULDNEVER MAKE A MISTAKE.
OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS INMAKING THAT SYSTEM, GOVERNMENT
DOES NOTHING BUT MAKE MISTAKES.
>> JON: SO WE HAVE, IN ANATTEMPT TO CONTROL FOR EACH
OUTCOME, HAVE CREATED ANUNEXPECTED OUTCOME THAT WE
DIDN'T INTEND TO CREATE?
>> RIGHT.
PARALYSIS.
>> Jon: YES.
[LAUGHTER]BUT IS THE ANSWER THEN... ARE
OUR ONLY TWO CHOICES APARALYZED, BUREAUCRATIC SATIRE
OF A GOVERNMENT OR AN 1890SSIX-YEAR-OLDS?
SURE.
THEY CAN WORK IN MINES.
YOU KNOW, WHAT IS OUR, WHATIS OUR MIDDLE GROUND?
WHERE DO WE GO?
>> THE MIDDLE GROUND IS... THECONSTITUTION IS AN OPEN
FRAMEWORK OF GOALS ANDPRINCIPLES.
IT'S TEN PAGES LONG.
THE VOLCKER RULE IS 980 PAGES.
LAW IS SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH PEOPLE
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
AND THEN YOU HOLD IN THEDEMOCRATIC PROCESS PEOPLE
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHETHER THEYSUCCEED IN RUNNING THE AGENCY
PROPERLY OR WHATEVER.
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY THEAUTHORITY THAT GOES WITH THE
RESPONSIBILITY WITH LITERALLYHUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WORDS OF
LAW, SO THAT IT'S BECOME THISVAST VAT OF LEGAL QUICKSAND.
IT GETS THICKER EVERY YEAR.
IT'S A PROGRESSIVE DISEASE.
IT IS WORSE NOW THAN IT WAS 20YEARS AGO.
IT WILL BE WORSE NEXT YEAR.
>> Jon: BUT WHY CAN'T WE GO IN,TO USE A GEORGE BUSH PARLANCE,
AND CLEAR THE BRUSH?
[LAUGHTER]WHY CAN'T WE GO IN THERE AND
CLEAR SOME OF THE DEAD WOOD?
IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN EXERCISEANY SENSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE
AUTHORITY OR BUREAUCRATICAUTHORITY?
>> NOT UNTIL WE HAVE THE IDEATHAT WE NEED TO GO CLEAN IT OUT
AND RESTORE, ONE, HUMANRESPONSIBILITY AND RESET OUR
PRIORITIES.
WHAT WE NOW HAVE IS ALL THESELAWS PILING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OFDETAIL, SO THAT DEMOCRACY AT
THIS POINT IS BASICALLY RUN BYDEAD PEOPLE.
IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE ALL OFTHESE LAWS OVER THE LAST 30, 40,
50, 60 YEARS THAT LITERALLYDICTATE HOW YOU RUN THE V.A. OR
HOW YOU DO PROCUREMENT OF I.T.
SYSTEMS.
>> Jon: BUT IS THERE NO PROCESSIN PLACE WHERE COMMON SENSE --
THE V.A. IS AN EXCELLENTEXAMPLE.
THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG.
THEY DECIDE TO INCENTIVIZEQUICKER WAIT TIMES AT THE LOCAL
V.A.S WHILE INCREASING THENUMBER OF BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO
PEOPLE AND CLEARLY INCREASINGTHE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEED
TREATMENT THROUGH TWO WARS.
DOES ANYONE HAVE A MACRO VIEW OFTHAT AND THINK, OH, THOSE ARE
ALL AT CROSS-PURPOSES.
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TOACCOMPLISH THAT?
>> APPARENTLY NOT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ALITTLE MORE DETAIL IN THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
I THOUGHT WE'D GET INTO ALITTLE BIT OF THE NITTY-GRITTY.
BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT... THEN WHATARE THEY DOING?
>> THEY'RE SETTING METRICS ANDPUTTING IN ALL THESE RULES AND
EXPECT THAT PEOPLE CAN COMPLYWITH ALL THE RULES AND GET THE
JOB DONE.
THAT'S NOT HOW ANYBODY... NOT INTHE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE HAS
ANYONE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING BYFOLLOWING A RULE.
THEY ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES, THEYTAKE RESPONSIBILITY, AND THEY
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RESOURCESARE TO TAKE CARE OF THE V.A.,
AND THEY DO THE BEST JOB ANDTHAT REPORT AND SAY, YOU KNOW,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEWAITING TIMES TO 14 DAYS IF WE
HAVE BACKLOG OF 1,000 PEOPLEHERE.
AND THEY ACTUALLY REPORTHONESTLY AND THEY'RE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW WELL THEY DOGIVEN THE RESOURCES, NOT SOME
ARBITRARY METRIC, WHICH IS WHATHAPPENED HERE.
>> Jon: SO ARE STANDARDS ALWAYSANATHEMA? CAN YOU NEVER RELY ON,
LIKE, I'LL GIVE YOU ANEXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY IN
THE CITY, AND THIS MAY BE A POORONE, OUR GRADING
SYSTEM ON RESTAURANTS-- A, B, C, D.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DOTO GET THAT GRADE, BUT I WILL
TELL YOU THIS: I STOPPED EATINGAT B'S ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
[LAUGHTER]IT FEELS LIKE IT'S WORKING.
IT FEELS LIKE A BUREAUCRATICSYSTEM THAT HAS SET SOME
STANDARDS TO ACHIEVE AND HASDONE IT, AND IT'S SIMPLE AND
IT'S THE ALPHABET.
LORD KNOWS I LOVE THE ALPHABET.
[LAUGHTER]>> YEAH.
WELL, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LAWBE COMPREHENSIBLE, AND IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE INCHARGE OF LAW, THE BUREAUCRATS,
WHOEVER, BE ABLE TO EXERCISETHEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN
DETERMINING WHETHER A RESTAURANTMEETS SANITARY CODES AND SUCH,
AND THEY GIVE US A LETTER GRADEAND THE PUBLIC CAN SEE THAT IT
HAS A LETTER GRADE AND THAT CANMAKE A JUDGMENT.
THAT'S... GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORKTHAT WAY.
>> SO FROM WHAT I'M HEARING, THEWAY WE FIX THIS IS EVERYBODY
GETS A GRADE, A THROUGH F, ANDWE JUST START WEEDING THROUGH
THE DAMN THINGS.
WE'VE GOT GO TO COMMERCIAL, BUTON THE WEB YOU'LL EXPLAIN HOW
THAT WILL WORK CORRECTLY, YES?
>> YES.
>> Jon: GOOD MAN.
"THE RULE OF NOBODY," IT'S ONBOOKSHELVES NOW.
IT'S GREAT.
YOU GOT TO GET IT, AS ALWAYS.
PHILIP K. HOWARD.
WE'LL BE BACK.
