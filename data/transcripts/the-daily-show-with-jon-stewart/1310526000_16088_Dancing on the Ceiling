[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THE GREAT KID ROCK WILL BE
JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM
TONIGHT, AND I'M GOING TO GO
WITH SHARK.
ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOLKS, I'M GOING TO START WITH A
PROBLEM.
WE GOT A PROBLEM.
APPARENTLY AMERICA SPENDS MORE
THAN IT TAKES IN.
SO AMERICA NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT A
WAY TO BECOME MORE FISCALLY
RESPONSIBLE.
UNFORTUNATELY WHILE AMERICA
FIGURES IT OUT, THERE IS A REPO
MAN, LET'S CALL HIM "CHINA,"
THAT ON AUGUST 2nd COULD
POSSIBLY REPOSSESS US.
[LAUGHTER]
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A
COUPLE OF GOOD DEBT REDUCTION
OPTIONS AT OUR DISPOSAL.
WORSE COMES TO WORSE, WE COULD
FOR SOME WEIRD REASON
ARBITRARILY CHANGE THE MONEY
WE'RE ALLOWED TO BE IN DATE,
WHICH MAKES NO [BLEEPED] SENSE
WHATSOEVER, BUT THE BAD NEWS IS
THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF PUTTING
TOGETHER THIS COUNTRY-SAVING
PLANS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO AS
OF TODAY ARE CURRENTLY ON THE
FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES DOING THIS.
>> THE NEW INCANDESCENT BULB
LOOKS AND WORKS JUST LIKE THE
OLD INCANDESCENT BULB.
>> SO IF WE DON'T PASS THIS
BILL, WE MIGHT AS WELL TURN OUT
THE LIGHTS.
THE PARTY IS OVER FOR THE
TRADITIONAL INCANDESCENT
LIGHTBULB.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I WANT TO MAKE IT
CLEAR.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR,
THEY AREN'T FIGHTING ABOUT
LIGHTBULB STANDARDS.
THEY ARE REFIGHTING A LIGHTBULB
STANDARDS FIGHT THAT WE SET NEW
ZEALAND 2007.
WE'RE THREE WEEKS A I WAY FROM
HAVING TO PARK OUR COUNTRY DOWN
THE STREET SO CHINA CAN'T FIND
IT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THESE YUTSES ARE RELIT
GAITING INCANDESCENT V.
FLORESCENT.
WE ARE LIKE CHILDREN.
THAT IS WHY YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN
DAD, MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN, HAD TO
COME HOME EARLY FROM WORK AND
GIVE US A TALKING TO ABOUT NOT
CLEANING OUR BUDGET.
>> WE'RE GOING TO MEET EVERY
SINGLE DAY UNTIL WE GET THIS
THING RESOLVED.
WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE BY
AUGUST 2nd.
WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT NOW.
PULL OFF THE BANDAID.
EAT OUR PEAS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WHO KEEPS PEAS UNDER THEIR
BANDAIDS?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, YOU GET THE SENSE THAT
OBAMA IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN
HISTORY THAT BEGINS EVERY PRESS
CONFERENCE WITH A HEAVY SIGH.
[LAUGHTER]
HE JUST COMES OUT AND GOES...
[LONG SIGH]
I GUESS HE HAD NO IDEA HAVING
CHILDREN WOULD BE THIS HARD.
WAIT, I'M BEING TOLD THAT HIS
PEAS MENTION WAS NOT A METAPHOR.
DURING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS,
APPARENTLY SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
JOHN BOEHNER WAS LITERALLY NOT
EATING HIS PEAS.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS THE
CASE.
SO ANYWAY, HERE'S WHAT OBAMA
PROPOSED TO GET US OUT OF THIS
PROBLEM.
DEMOCRATS GET $1 TRILLION IN
UPPER-CLASS TAX INCREASES
AND CORPORATE LOOPHOLE CLOSURES,
AND REPUBLICANS GET $3 THRIL IN
ENTITLEMENT AND SPENDING CUTS
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE
PARAMETERS OF THE NEGOTIATION
ARE THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TAX
INCREASES AND REPUBLICANS WANT
SPENDING CUTS, AND HE WANTS TO
DO A PEAS AND BANDAID
COMBINATION.
[BLEEPED] I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'RE IN A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
NEGOTIATION.
>> MOST AMERICANS WOULD SAY A
BALANCED APPROACH IS A SIMPLE
ONE.
THE ADMINISTRATION GETS ITS DEBT
LIMIT INCREASE AND THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE GET THEIR SPENDING CUTS.
AND THEIR REFORMS.
>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
YOU SEE THE PROBLEM?
THE ADMINISTRATION GETS ITS DEBT
LIMIT INCREASE.
THE ARBITRARY SPENDING LIMIT,
WHICH CONGRESS HAS RELEASED TEN
TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.
NOW THAT'S THE BIG GIVE IN THE
NEGOTIATION.
IT'S NOT, ALL RIGHT, LET'S ALL
CHIP IN AND BUY A GETTING FOR
THE PARTY.
IT'S BUY ME A KEG AND I WON'T
BURN YOUR [BLEEPED] HOUSE DOWN.
NOW, WHY WOULD OBAMA AND THE
DEMOCRATS GET THE IMPRESSION
THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY A GIVE?
>> NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT NOT
RAISING THE DEBT CEILING.
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT DISCUSSED
BY ANYBODY, NOT IN THE CONGRESS.
YEAH, NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT
DOING THAT.
>> Jon: [WHISPERING] THE
LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
SEE, THE LEADER OF THE SENATE
REPUBLICANS STATED ON SUNDAY
THAT OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO
RAISE THE DEBT CEILING.
NOW, WHY WOULD THE REPUBLICANS
GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY CAN
PLAY SILLY POLITICS WITH
SOMETHING LIKE OUR CREDIT
RATING?
BECAUSE IN 2006 THE PRESIDENT
AND FRESHMAN SENATOR VOTED
AGAINST RAISING THE DEBT
CEILING.
AND WHY DID HE DO THAT?
>> THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A
NEW SENATOR, YOU KNOW, MAKING
WHAT IS A POLITICAL VOTE AS
OPPOSED TO DOING WHAT WAS
IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY, AND
I'M THE FIRST ONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE
IT.
>> Jon: HEY, MAN, THAT WAS
FIVE YEARS AGO, MAN.
[LAUGHTER]
I WAS A KID.
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE [BLEEPED]
AROUND IN THEIR EARLY 40s.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NOW I'M IN MY MID-40s.
TIME TO GROW UP.
BUT HERE'S THE WORST PART.
THE REPUBLICAN INSISTENCE ON
MAKING THE DEBT CEILING THEIR
GIVE AS OPPOSED TO INCREASED TAX
REVENUES, DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A
CYNICAL POLITICAL PLOY.
I THINK THEY REALLY BELIEVE THIS
[BLEEPED].
>> THE PRESIDENT AND I DO NOT
AGREE ON HIS VIEW THAT
GOVERNMENT NEEDS MORE REVENUE
THROUGH HIGHER TAXES ON JOB
CREATORS.
>> Jon: HIGHER TAXES ON JOB
CREATORS?
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH
THAT?
IT'S LIKE A DOCTOR CONSULTING
WITH A PATIENT WHO BELIEVES
STRICTLY IN MAGIC.
[LAUGHTER]
BROKEN LEG?
THAT'S NOTHING A FROG WING AND
FIRE DANCE AND SOME RHINOCEROS
