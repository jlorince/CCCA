( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT ON THISPROGRAM, THE STAR OF THE NEW
MOVIE "INFINITELY POLAR BEAR,"MARK RUFFALO WILL BE JOINING US.
BUT FIRST, TONIGHT--
( CHEERS )
NOW THAT I'M IN THAT FINAL RUNOF SHOWS I'VE BEEN THINKING A
LOT ABOUT THE PAST, SOME THINGSDIRIGHT-- MY VACATION BEARD.
THAT, MWA!
BUT THINGS DIWRONG, DIPPING MYVACATION BEARD IN MARSHMALLOW
FLUFF, WHICH IS SOMETHING DIONTHE SHOW, AND ATTENDING A
CONVENTION OF FERAL BADGERMARSHMELLOW FETISHISTS.
THEY REALLY RIPPED THE [BLEEP]OUT OF IT. BUT!
BY FAR ONE OF THE THINGS THATSTRUCK ME THAT I DID WRONG, ONE
OF THE MOST IS MY 10-HOURINTERVIEW WITH DONALD RUMSFELD,
ABOUT A 10-HOUR INTERVIEW WHEREI CONFRONTED ONE OF THE
ARCHITECTS OF THE IRAQ WAR ANDTHROUGH THE MOST SICRATTIC LINE
OF QUESTIONING, DISSOLVED HIMINTO A PUDDLE OF ATONEMENT--
WHICH IS ONE OF THE LEAST FUNPUDDLES FOR CHILDREN TO SPLASH
AROUND IN.
I THOUGHT I WOULD DO THAT, BUTSADLY--
IN THE EFFORT THAT IT TOOK TOSELL US THIS--
THAT'S-- SELL IS THE WORD?LET ME BACK UP.
>> A LITTLE STRONG.
>> Jon:  IN THE EFFORT IT TOOKTHE ADMINISTRATION TO --
>> PRESENT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  TRYING TO HELP ME,HUH?
TRY TO HELP ME?
WELL, THE JERK STORE CALLED.
THEY'RE OUT OF YOU.
SADLY, I DIDN'T SAY THAT, AND INAN INSTANT, RUMSFELD WAS GONE.
AND I WOULD NEVER GET MY CHANCEAGAIN, OR SO I THOUGHT.
>> DONALD RUMSFELD IS NOW SAYINGHE WAS SKEPTICAL WHEN GEORGE W.
BUSH WAS INVADING IRAQ ANDSAYING WE WOULD HAVE A
DEMOCRACY.
>> THE IDEA THAT WE COULDFASHION A DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ
SEEMED TO ME UNREALISTIC.
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT WHEN IFIRST HEARD THOSE WORDS.
>> Jon:  WERE YOU?
WELL.
I THINK WE CAN FILE THAT UNDER"COMMENTS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
USEFUL EARLIER."
( LAUGHTER )
RIGHT BEHIND THE "HINDENBURG"ENGINEER WHO SAID, "I DON'T
KNOW, I THOUGHT HYDROGENWAS FLAMMABLE."
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT'S TIMEFOR "STEWART VERSUS RUMSFELD 2":
THE GRUDGE MATCH," BROUGHT TOYOU BY ARBY'S.
ARBY'S, IT'S LIKE ON HOCKSHOCKAND AWE FOR YOUR BOWELS.
SO THIS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I HAVE NO-- NEVER EVEN EATENTHERE.
THIS IS BEING DONALD RUMSFELD,AFTER SUGGESTING THAT HE KNEW
ALL ALONG THAT SPREADINGDEMOCRACY IN IRAQ WAS A BAD
IDEA, HE RAN TO FOX TO CLARIFY.
>> WELL, IT'S NONE SENSE.  THEARTICLE WAS NOT ACCURATE.
WHAT I SAID WAS I'M FORDEMOCRACY BUT MY CONCERN ABOUT
THE WORD WAS THAT IT WOULD LEAVETHE IMPRESSION IN THAT COUNTRY
INACCURATELY THAT THE UNITEDSTATES INTENDED TO IMPOSE ITS
FORM OF DEMOCRACY ON THEIRCOUNTRY.
THE IDEA THAT OUR TEMPLATE WOULDFIT THEM AT THEIR STAGE OF EF--
OF THE EVOLVING GOVERNANCE, ITHOUGHT WAS-- WOULD BE AN
UNFORTUNATE IMPRESSION ON THEIRPART.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW-- OKAY-- I GETTHE CLARIFICATION.
YOU DIDN'T WANT THE IRAQIS TOHAVE AN UNFORTUNATE IMPRESSION
ABOUT OUR USE OF THE WORDDEMOCRACY.
WHERE COULD THEY HAVE GOTTENTHAT IMPRESSION FROM?
>> WE EXPECT THEM TO BEPROFESSIONAL AND BEHAVE IN A WAY
THAT SET THIS COUNTRY ALONG APATH OF DEMOCRACY.
PREDICTABLY WE'RE HEARING FROMTHOSE WHO SAY THE IRAQIS CANNOT
PULL OFF A TRANSITION TODEMOCRACY.
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED INUKRAINE.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED INEASTERN EUROPE.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED INAFGHANISTAN.
IS SOMEONE SMART ENOUGH TON THEIRAQIS ARE, FOR WHATEVER REASON,
UNIQUE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH,THAT THEY'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF LIVING IN A FREE SYSTEM?
THERE ARE DOUBTERS AND THOSEHOSAY IT CAN'T BE DONE.
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DOUBTERSWHO HAVE SAID IT COULDN'T BE
DONE.
>> Jon:  AND ONE OF THOSEDOUBTERS WILL BE ME
RETROSPECTIVELY 11 YEARS AFTERTHE INVASION.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I SOUGHT AND WORKED TIRE WILYTO MAKE HAPPEN SO MY POINT IS, I
WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.
WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAYTHIS, BUT WE GOT YOU, DONALD
RUMSFELD!
WE GOT YOU!
YEAH!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
♪  ♪
BAM!
WE GOT YA!
YEAH!
WE...
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, THAT FELT STRANGELYHOLLOW.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW, I PLACED A LOT OFSTOCK IN THE IDEA THAT GETTING
RUMSFELD OR DOUGLAS FIFE, ORBUSH, OR CHENEY, JUDITH MILLER,
RICHARD PERLE, BREMER, RICE--ANY OF THE OTHER ARCHITECTS OR
ENABLERS OF THE IRAQ WAR WETRIED TO HAVE ON  THE SHOW,
I PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN THE IDEATHAT CATCHING THEM IN SOME SORT
OF ILLOGICAL TRAP OR FORCINGTHEM TO ADMIT THE ERRORS
OF THEIR WAYS WOULD BE THEULTIMATE VICTORY BUT NOW I
WONDER AS WE RETURN TO OURSEGMENT, "LEARNING CURVES ARE
FOR PUSSIES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE BEST--ONE OF THE BEST, MOST CATHARTIC
EXAMPLES OF CATCHING ONE OFTHESE WAR ARCHITECT WAS ERROLL
MORRIS' GREAT DOCUMENTARY "FOGOF WAR" WHERE MORRIS GETS
ANOTHER GRAY-HAIRED, WIRE-RIMMEDDEFENSE SECRETARY TO COME
CLEAN ABOUT JUST HOW(BLEEP ) WRONG HE HAD BEEN, THIS
TIME ABOUT VIETNAM.
>> I'M VERY SORRY THAT THE INTHE PROCESS OF ACCOMPLISHING
THINGS I MADE ERRORS.
WAR IS SO COMPLEX IT'S BEYONDTHE ABILITY OF THE HUMAN MIND TO
COMPREHEND ALL THE VARIABLES,OUR JUDGMENT, OR UNDERSTANDING,
ARE NOT ADEQUATE, AND WE KILLPEOPLE UNNECESSARILY.
>> Jon:  REGRET, ATONEMENT.
MORRIS GOT McNAMARA.
AND YOU'D LIKE TO THINK THEVALUE OF THESE REVELATIONS IS
THAT THEY WOULD GIVE PAUSE TOOTHER, ALMOST ( BLEEP )
IDENTICAL-LOOKING DEFENSESECRETARY WHO MIGHT BE
CONSIDERING MAKING THESE SAMEEXACT ERRORS.
NOW, ADMITTEDLY "FOG OF WAR"CAME OUT IN DECEMBER OF 2003.
IT WAS A FEEL-GOOD CHRISTMASMOVIE, I BELIEVE, AT THE TIME.
ORIGINAL TITLE WAS "JUNGLE ALLTHE WAY."
BY THAT TIME, RUMSFELD WAS NINEMONTHS DEEP INTO THE IRAQ
QUAGMIRE SO TOO LATE FORRUMSFELD TO HAVE LEARNED
McNAMARA'S SECOND-HAND LESSONOF VIETNAM -- SO IT WOULD BE A
VALID EXCUSE IF RUMSFELD HADN'TALREADY LEARNED THE SAME LESSONS
ABOUT VIETNAM FIRSTHAND AS SHOWNIN ERROLL MORRIS' OTHER GREAT
IDENTICAL-LOOKING DOCUMENTARY,THE UNKNOWN KNOWN.
>> NORTH VIETNAMESE AND VIETCONG FORCES MOVED INTO SAIGON.
I WAS IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITHSECRETARY KISSINGER AND THE
PRESIDENT.
IT WAS A DAY ANYONE INVOLVEDWILL NEVER FORGET.
THE INEVITABLE, UGLY ENDING OFAN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT.
>> Jon:  YEAH.
THAT'S THE BANNER THAT SHOULDHAVE BEEN UP ON THAT ( BLEEP )
"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" BOAT!
WELL, ALL RIGHT, RUMSFELD, HEDIDN'T THINK THAT THE VIETNAM
LESSON WAS APROPOS TO THE MIDDLEEAST.
( APPLAUSE )
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT THE VIETNAMLESSON WAS APROPOS TO THE MIDDLE
EAST.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VALID IFRUMSFELD HADN'T ALREADY LEARNED
FIRSTHAND LESSONS OF THE MIDDLEEAST FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> I WOULD SEND CABLES TO REPORTBACK ON MY OBSERVATIONS AND I
TITLED ONE OF THEM, BACK INNOVEMBER OF 1983 "THE SWAMP."
I SUSPECT WE OUGHT TO LIGHTENOUR HAND IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES THAT ITIS EASIER TO GET INTO SOMETHING
THAN IT IS TO GET OUT OF IT.
>> Jon:  YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VEKEPT REMINDING YOURSELF THAT!
HOW DID YOU FORGET THAT LESSON?
WHY DID YOU FORGET THAT LESSON?
OH, IT WAS THE 80s.
EVERYONE OF HIGH ON COKE.
YOU KNOW HOW STEPHEN KINGDOESN'T REMEMBER WRITING "CUJO."
SAME WITH ME AND MY IMPRECIANT1980S MIDDLE EAST QUAGMIRE
MEMO.
AND WHY SHOULD HE?
BECAUSE AS WE HAVE SEEN,LEARNING CURVES ARE FOR PUSSIES.
AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH RUMSFELDLEARNED NO LESSONS FROM HIS
EXPERIENCE WITH WAR.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S ALESSON TO BE TAKEN FROM THIS?
>> SOME THINGS WORK OUT.
SOME THINGS DON'T.
THAT DIDN'T.
IF THAT'S A LESSON, YES, IT'S ALESSON.
>> Jon:  THAT'S NOT ALESSON.
( LAUGHTER )
THE LESSON FROM A DECADE-LONGELECTIVE WAR AGAINST A HOSTILE
POPULATION SPLIT INTO SEPARATEFACTIONS AND SHIFTING LOYALTIES
IS NOT, EH, ( BLEEP ) HAPPENS.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE THE WINDSHIELD.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE THE BUG.
THAT'S NOT THE LESSON.
AND THERE IT IS.
THAT'S WHY THESE TRAPS ANDGETTING THEM TO ADMIT THINGS IS
SO HOLLOW.
IF YOU CAN GET ONE OF THESE GUYSTO ADMIT THEIR MISTAKES YOU MAY
HAVE A MOMENT OFSELF-SATISFACTION AND
CATHARTHSIS BUT IT DOESN'TMITIGATE THE HORRIBLE
CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE DECISIONS,NOR DOES IT STOP THE NEXT GUY
FROM REPEATING THOSE MISTAKESAND I'M SURE IN THE FUTURE THERE
WILL BE ANOTHERSLICK-BACKED-HAIR,
WIRE-RIM-GLASSES-WEARING( BLEEP ), WHO IS WELL VERSED IN
HISTORY WHO SAYS ABSOLUTELY WESHOULD INVADE MIDDLE EARTH.
I'M SURE WE CAN STABILIZE IT.
HOBBITS, OCRS, ELEVES, DRAGONS,THEY WANT OUR SYSTEM OF
GOVERNMENT.
CERTAINLY THEY WILL WELCOME USAS LIBERATORS.
AND BEFORE Y OU WRITE USLETTERS, I UNDERSTAND THE ELVES
WOULD HAVE LEFT MIDDLE EARTHFOR VALHALLAH BY THIS POINT.
SO PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE, IS ITFUTILE TO TRY TO PIN THESE
PEOPLE DOWN?
YES.
WOULD IT BE EASIER JUST TO GIVEUP AND LET RUMSFELD GO--
PREFERABLY ON AN ICE FLOW INTOTHE NORTH ATLANTIC?
YES, BECAUSE NO MATTER WHATEVIDENCE, NO MATTER WHAT
ARGUMENTS, OR HISTORICAL FACTYOU PUT IN FRONT OF THESE
PEOPLE, THEY THINK LEARNINGCURVES ARE FOR PUSSIES AND IF
EVEN IF THEY DID LEARN ITWOULDN'T CHANGE THE PAST OR
PREVENT THE SAME MISTAKES IN THEFUTURE.
WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO SAY TOYOU, IN THE FUTURE, PLEASE,
NEVER STOP TRYING ANYWAY.
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE THATONE DAY, THEY'LL THINK, JUST FOR
A SECOND, AND THAT SECOND WILLBE ENOUGH TIME FOR US TO SHOVE
THESE ( BLEEP ) ON TO THAT ICEFLOW.
SAY HI TO THE POLAR BEAR!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
