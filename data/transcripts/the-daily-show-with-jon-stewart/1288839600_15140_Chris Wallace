>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
ABOUT TO SEE AN INTERVIEW I DID WITH CHRIS WALLACE.
I WENT A LITTLE LONG.
YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE THING ON THE WEB THERE.
THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A COUPLE OF WEIRD CHOPS IN THERE.
I DON'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND THE HOST OF VERY POPULAR FOX NEWS SUNDAY, PLEASE WELCOME BACK
TO THE PROGRAM CHRIS WALLACE.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> LONG TIME NO SEE.
>> Jon: LONG TIME NO SEE.
>> I HEAR -- WERE YOU IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK.
>> Jon: WE WERE NOT.
>> YOU DIDN'T CALL.
>> Jon: THAT WAS ALL GREEN SCREEN.
>> NONE OF THAT HAPPENED.
SOMEBODY SAID TO ME -- I DON'T PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO YOUR CAREER.
>> Jon: NO ONE SHOULD.
>> SOMEONE SAID JON IS IN CHARACTER WASHINGTON -- JOHN IS IN WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: WE WERE THERE WITH A SIGN-MAKING CONVENTION WITH OF OTHER FOLKS.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM AT FOX.
GREAT JOB.
YOU DID IT.
YOU WORKED HARD AND YOU PULLED IT OFF.
TERRIFIC.
>> THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATING AND MORE RATINGS THAN CNN AND MSNBC COMBINED.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO RETAKING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
YOU DID IT.
IT WAS NOT AN EASY JOB.
IS IT WEIRD TO HAVE -- YOU GOT -- WHAT IS IT SARAH PALIN,
NEWT GINGRICH, MIKE HUCKABEE,
RICK SANTORUM, WHO ELSE IS RUNNING DO YOU THINK?
THEY WORK THERE?
IS IT HARD FOR YOU?
YOU ARE THE NEWS GUY.
YOU ARE THE ANCHOR.
YOU ARE THE GUY THAT I THINK KEEPS THEM FROM HONESTLY LIKE FLOATING OUT INTO --
>> I DIDN'T DISAGREE WITH A THING YOU SAID.
>> Jon: NO, I KNOW I'M IS SAYING -- WOULD IT BE HARD FOR YOU TO INTERVIEW SARAH PALIN.
SH-Z A COLLEAGUE.
WHO KNOWS SHE MIGHT END UP BEING YOUR SECRET SANTA AT THE OFFICE PARTY.
YOU ASK HER HARD QUESTIONS AND THEN SHE ENDS UP GETTING YOU AXE BODY SPRAY TO BE MEAN.
IS THAT A WEIRD THING FOR YOU AS THE JOURNALIST THERE?
>> NOT RIGHT NOW.
AND THE POINT IS THEY ARE CONTRIBUTORS AND I THINK IT'S TO OUR CREDIT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
SOME OF THE MOST COMPELLING VOICES IN THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AS CONTRIBUTORS.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> NOBODY IS PRETENDING ANYTHING OTHER THAN REPUBLICANS AND OPINION-MAKERS AND SHAPERS.
BUT IF THE MOMENT ANY OF THEM SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO RUN FOR OFFICE --
>> Jon: THEN YOU GO AT THEM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> YOU WATCH MY SHOW.
>> Jon: I DO.
>> DID YOU SEE MY INTERVIEW WITH CARLY FIORINA?
>> Jon: I DID.
>> I ASKED HER SEVEN TIMES --
>> Jon: YOU ASKED TREMENDOUS QUESTIONS.
WHEN McCAIN SELECTED SARAH PALIN AS THE VICE PRESIDENT YOU HAD SOME OF THE TOUGHEST
INTERVIEWS OF McCAIN AND SARAH PALIN.
WHEN YOU TALKED TO McCAIN AS ABOUT SARAH PALIN IS NOT QUALIFIED, WASN'T THAT YOUR MAIN
COMPLAINT ABOUT BARACK OBAMA.
KEEP GOING.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT YOU DID A GREAT JOB WITH THAT.
BUT I -- THE INTERVIEWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT NOW WITH YOU AND HER.
THEY ARE SLIGHTLY MORE GOOFY.
DON'T YOU THINK?
SINCE SHE GOT HIRED?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT WAS THE KIND OF SIGH OBAMA GAVE TODAY AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.
THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE UGH!
>> LOOK, IT'S INTERESTING.
IN FACT YOU ARE WRONG, DURING THE TIME THAT SHE WAS RUNNING WITH McCAIN SHE NEVER ONCE
CAME ON FOX NEWS.
>> Jon: McCAIN --
>> McCAIN DID BUT PALIN NEVER DID.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE THE TOUGHEST JOB THERE.
YOU KNOW -- ZIT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN SHE SAYS THINGS LIKE CANDIDATES SHOULD
COME ON FOX NEWS TO GET THEIR MESSAGE, THEY SHOULD SPEAK THROUGH FOX NEWS.
ALMOST AS THOUGH SHE CONSIDERS IT A DIRECT MEGA PHONE RATHER THAN A NEWS ORGANIZATION.
>> THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THAT STORY.
CHRIS MATTHEWS ON MSNBC COVERAGE HAD MICHELLE BATCH HANN AND HE SAID NOW THAT YOU HAVE SUBPOENA
POWERS ARE GOING TO SUBPOENAING DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS.
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW I SAY THAT SUBPOENAING --
>> Jon: YOU ARE ON COMEDY CENTRAL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AT ALL.
>> SHE SAID NO WE'RE MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY.
HE SAYS DO YOU HAVE A HIP KNOW TIFT -- DO THEY HAVE IN YOU A TRANCE.
THEY ARE BIASED.
>> JOY I DON'T DISAGLOW.
I THINK MSNBC HAS MADE A MISTAKE TO ATTACK FOX ON ITS OWN FIELD.
I'VE MADE A CRITICISM OF THE MEDIA RECENTLY.
>> REALLY?
>> Jon: THEY SAID I WAS DRAWING A FALSE EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN FOX AND MSNBC.
>> NONE OF US THINK WE'RE EQUIVALENT WITH THEM.
>> Jon: YOU ARE NOT.
THAT IS DOUBLE A BALL THAT IS CUTE BUT YOU ARE THE BEST.
SERIOUSLY YOU ARE THE BEST.
>> SOMETHING IS HEADED TOWARDS ME AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT --
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW HOW TO PRODUCE TELEVISION.
YOU HAVE A CLEAR NARRATIVE.
>> IS IT THE TRUTH?
>> Jon: NO.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH PARTY YOU WANT TO ELECT BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT IN SOME WAYS MSNBC BY TRYING TO
MAYBE BECOME A VERSION OF THAT -- YOU CANNOT DEFEAT FOX BY BECOMING WHAT THEY SAY YOU ARE.
IF FOX'S GAME IS THE MEDIA'S BIASED AGAINST REPUBLICANS ALL YOU ARE DOING IS GIVING THEM
THAT FIELD.
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DEFEAT THEM IS THROUGH LIKE AN EARNED CREDIBILITY NOT AN EARNED
PARTNERSHIP -- PARTISANSHIP.
THEY ARE MAKING A MISTAKE BY BECOMING EQUIVALENT TO FOX RATHER THAN BECOMING A BRAND NEW
JOURNALISTIC ORGANIZATION.
DON'T YOU THINK?
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
YOU THOUGHT I WAS TIRED?
YOU THOUGHT I COULDN'T HANDLE IT TODAY?
>> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE GOING TO FINISH THAT SENTENCE.
>> Jon: I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WAS GOING.
ARE THEY MAKING A MISTAKE TRYING TO PATTERN THEMSELVES AFTER YOU GUYS?
>> THEY ARE MAKING A MISTAKE BECAUSE THEY ARE WRONG.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WAIT WRONG IN THEIR POLITICAL VIEWPOINT OR WRONG IN BECOMING --
>> WRONG IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY.
I THINK THAT THE COUNTRY SENT A REAL CLEAR.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLS.
IN 2008 INDEPENDENTS -- THAT IS THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY, NOT REPUBLICANS, NOT DEMOCRATS WENT
FOR OBAMA BY EIGHT POINTS.
LAST NIGHT THEY WENT FOR REPUBLICANS BY 15 POINTS.
IT'S A 23-POINT SWING.
74% OF THE COUNTRY SAID THEY ARE ANGRY OR DISSATISFIED WITH THE PHYSICAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
THERE'S -- WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
THERE'S GOING WRONG OUT THERE.
TO PRETEND IT'S NOT IS WRONG.
>> Jon: I DON'T SUGGEST FOX PLANTED THE DISSATISFACTION IN THE COUNTRY.
YOU CAN'T DOM ALONG -- COME ALONG AND SAY PEOPLE ARERY.
BUT I DIDN'T HURT.
CAN I COME ON YOUR SHOW?
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME ON.
>> Jon: I WILL.
>> YOU WILL COME ON?
>> Jon: I REALLY LIKE YOU.
THERE ARE TALENTED PEOPLE WHO DO A GOOD THING.
IT'S GOOD TELEVISION.
>> YOU WANT TO BE ON THE PANEL?
>> Jon: NO, I DON'T LIKE THOSE PEOPLE?
>> YOU WANT TO BE A SINGLE GUEST ON THE SHOW?
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> YOU'LL COME DOWN TO WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: YOU'RE IN WASHINGTON?
CAN WE DID A SATELLITE DO HICKEY?
>> SUNDAY MORNING 9:00 A.M.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> YOU WILL COME ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
>> Jon: I WILL COME ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
>> WE'VE ASKED YOU A BUNCH OF TIMES.
>> Jon: WHAT DID I SAY?
>> WE NEVER GOT TO YOU WE GOT TO YOUR MINIONS WHO SAID ARE YOU KIDDING.
>> Jon: WE HARD ON ME UNLESS I ANNOUNCE I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
FOX NEWS SUNDAY, CHECK OUT CHRIS WALLACE'S SHOW FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
IT IS REALLY GOOD AND HE IS REALLY GOOD ON IT.
I REALLY DO RESPECT YOU.
>> DO YOU REALIZE HOW BADLY YOU HURT ME.
