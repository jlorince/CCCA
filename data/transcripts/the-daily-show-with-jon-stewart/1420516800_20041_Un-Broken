THEY DIDN'T MAKE OUR BANKINGSYSTEM LESS EVIL, BUT
STILL -- NORTH KOREA IS OURWORST ENEMY ON EARTH AND
THEY ARE STILL ALLOWED TOUSE OUR ATMs?

PRE-MED PROGRAM NOW.
(LAUGHTER)NOT SURE WHAT THE
STATE SPONSORED TERROR LIST ISGOING TO ACCOMPLISH EITHER
THERE, DOES THAT MEAN ISIS ISGOING TO HAVE TO WEAR UNIFORMS
THAT SAY NORTH KOREA ON THEM? ISTHAT -- I GUESS OUR
