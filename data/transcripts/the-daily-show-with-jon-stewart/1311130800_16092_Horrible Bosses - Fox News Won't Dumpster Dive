DO WE OWN PARLIAMENT YET?
(LAUGHTER)
ALL IN ALL, IT'S A STORY TAILOR
MADE FOR THE 24 HOUR NEWS
CULTURE.
BIG PERSONALITY, SCANDAL,
BRIBERY, HACKING, CELEBRITY,
DEATH.
BUT ONE NETWORK HAS BEEN
RETICENT TO DUMPSTER DIVE INTO
ANY ASPECT OF THE STORY OTHER
THAN THEIR HERE IS
DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOME OF THEIR
COMPETITOR'S BEHAVIOR.
>> WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN
THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
WE ARE TEETERING ON DEFAULT AND
WHAT DO THEY DO?
THEY TALK ABOUT THIS.
>> VIRTUALLY EVERY TABLOID IS
GUILTY OF SOME KIND OF OFFENSE.
>> WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE PILING
ON?
WE KNOW IT'S A HACKING SCANDAL.
SHOULDN'T WE GET BEYOND IT?
>> THE LEFT HAS BEEN OUT TO GET
NEWSCORP, ESPECIALLY FOX NEWS
CHANNEL AND THE MURDOCH FAMILY
FOR YEARS.
>> MURDOCH, WHO OWNS IT, HAS
APOLOGIZED BUT FOR SOME REASON
THE PUBLIC, THE MEDIA, KEEPS
GOING OVER THIS AGAIN AND AND
AGAIN.
>> THE PILING ON.
S.
>> THIS IS THE BIGGEST CASE OF
PILING ON SINCE THE LAST RUGBY
GAME I SAW.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: RUGBY, BY THE WAY, IF
YOU'RE GOING TO KISS RUPERT
MURDOCH'S ASS WITH A REFERENCE,
AT LEAST CALL IT AUSSIE RULES
FOOTBALL.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO SAY THE BIGGEST CASE OF
PILING ON SINCE COMMON READ A
POEM AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
BUT...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MAYBE YOUR COMPETITORS ARE
TAKING AN UNSEEMLY AMOUNT OF
PLEASURE.
BUT PERHAPS THEY DON'T HAVE
FOX'S FINELY TUNED SENSE OF PRO
PROPORTIONALITY.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO
SPOT STORIES OF REAL CRIMINALITY
AND IMPORT, LIKE THE CRIMES OF,
LET'S SAY, NPR.
>> THE NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO
EXECUTIVE CAUGHT ON TAPE IN A
BIGOTED HATE-FILLED RANT.
>> JUAN WILLIAMS FIRED BY NPR
FOR SAYING HE GETS NERVOUS WHEN
FLYING WITH MUSLIMS.
>> THE UPHEAVAL AT NPR REACHED
ITS ZENITH TODAY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL
SUPPORTS GIVING NPR YOUR TAX
DOLLAR MONEY.
>> ON THE NPR SCANDAL, IS THE
LEFT WING MEDIA PLAYING THAT
DOWN?
>> LIBERALS ARE INTOLERANT.
>> WE'VE LINKED NPR TO SOROS, WE
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING OVER
THERE.
>> THE CORRUPTION IS SO
WIDESPREAD IT'S SUCCEEDED IN
PERMEATING EVERY AREA OF THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
>> THESE CRACKPOTS AT NPR.
>> THE TOTALITARIAN TACTICS OF
THE LEFT.
>> IS NPR AN AGENT SOMEHOW OF A
JIHADIST INQUISITION.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: IS NPR AN AGENT
SOMEHOW OF A JIHADIST
INQUISITION?
I'M GOING SAY YES BECAUSE WHY
ELSE WOULD YOU BRING IT UP?
(LAUGHTER)
SEE, THAT IS A REASONABLY
PROPORTIONED RESPONSE.
THIS IS OVERREACTION TO THE
MURDOCH CASE WHICH WHAT IS AT
MOST AN EPIC BRIBERY AND
INFLUENCE PEDDLING SCANDAL
CONSUMING BRITAIN'S POLITICAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JOURNALISTIC
ESTABLISHMENT IS REALLY A WASTE
OF EVERYONE'S TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHAT THE
PROBLEM, IS YOU'RE JEALOUS.
AS A NEWSCORP PROPERTY, YOU'RE
NOT UPSET THAT YOUR STANDARDS
HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED BY YOUR
SCANDAL BONER ETHIC.
YOU'RE UPSET THEY GET TO HAVE
THE FUN WHILE YOU GET TO SIT ON
YOUR HANDS.
THIS SCANDAL WAS MADE FOR YOU
GUYS!
FOR GOD'S SAKE, LOOK AT THESE,
D.S.K., MADE MEN, THAT'S A GREAT
ONE.
OBAMA BEATS WEINER.
OSAMA BIN LADEN BIN WEST
BANKING.
THESE ARE PRICELESS PUNS.
IMAGINE THE FRUSTRATION THAT THE
PUN MASTERS OVER THERE MUST BE
FEELING.
THEY'RE MISSING OUT ON THE
CHANCE TO SHAME A HIGH PROFILE
MEDIA MOGUL, MAKE THAT NASTY
INSINUATIONS ABOUT HIS SECOND IN
COMMAND.
INDULGE IN PUNS ABOUT HER
PERSONAL APPEARANCE.
AND THE DEATH OF A
WHISTLE-BLOWER?
RIGHT!
I MEAN, IT'S EASY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S SO EASY!
POOR BASTARDS!
NOW, I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU
DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO CONFRONT
MURDOCH ON THIS, I'VE SEEN YOU
DO IT.
WHEN THIS SCANDAL BROKE IN 2009,
FOX'S STEVE BARNEY YANKED
MURDOCH'S ASS OUT OF SUN VALLEY
AND LAID THE SMACK DOWN.
>> THE STORY THAT IS REALLY
BUZZING ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND CERTAINLY HERE IN NEW YORK
IS THAT THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD,"
A NEWS CORPORATION NEWSPAPER IN
BRITAIN...
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT
ISSUE AT ALL TODAY.
SORRY.
>> I CAN, NO WORRIES MR.
CHAIRMAN, THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
