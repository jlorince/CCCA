AT SOME POINT, BUT WHO GIVES A
(BLEEP)?
FOR MORE ON "HOW DOES WEDNESDAY
WORK?
NOT GREAT?
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THURSDAY-GATE"
I'M JOINED BY SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN, I DON'T SEE WHAT THIS IS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IN ANY WAY.
>> WHAT?
>> I DON'T ZEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL
IS ABOUT ANY OF THIS.
>> OH, REALLY?
REALLY, YOU DON'T SEE IT, JON?
A PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH AND A
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ON THE SAME
NIGHT?
YOU ARE FORCING AMERICA INTO A
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.
ON ONE CHANNEL IS THE PRESIDENT
USING A JOINT SESSION TO UNVEIL
A PLAN WHICH REALISTICALLY CAN
DO LITTLE TO DIMINISH AMERICA'S
SOARING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES WHILE
AT THE VERY SAME TIME A HANDFUL
OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ABOUT
WHOM THEIR OWN PARTY CAN'T EVEN
GET EXCITED WILL COMPETITIVELY
PANDER TO A SMALL BUT VOCAL
COLLECTION OF ELDERLY LUNATICS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND YOU CAN ONLY WATCH ONE OF
THOSE, JON.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST ONE.
>> Jon: IT'S NOT EXACT I
"SOPHIE'S CHOICE."
>> OF COURSE IT'S NOT, SOPHIE
HAD IT EASY.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU OBVIOUSLY GO WITH BOY.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, WHO CHOOSES TO SAVE THE
GIRL FROM THE NAZIS?
SHE'S WEAK, SHE'LL NEVER SURVIVE
THE POLISH WINTER.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S EASY.
IT'S A NO BRAINER FOR SOPHIE.
>> Jon: WHO WOULD CHOICE THAT?
>> WHO WOULD CHOICE IT?
>> Jon: WHO WOULD CHOICE IT?
WHO CAN CHOICE?
>> WHO CAN CHOICE BUT SOPHIE.
>> Jon: PECK STOP TAKING AND
CUT OUT THAT BECAUSE YOU WISH
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.
>> NO, WRONG, JON, I STAND BY
IT.
IN FACT, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN IN
CASE YOU EDIT IT OUT.
SOPHIE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE
BOY.
THE BOY.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, PLEASE.
PLEASE.
LET'S GET BACK TO... YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A
BIG PROBLEM IF BOTH THINGS
HAPPENED THE SAME NIGHT?
>> HUGE, JON.
AND THE PUBLIC CONUNDRUM WOULD
HAVEN'T ENDED THERE.
THEY STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF
MISSING BOTH POLITICAL EVENTS
AND WATCHING "GHOSTS CAUGHT ON
CAPE" ON THE BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL.
THEY'RE GHOSTS, JON!
AND THEY'RE CAUGHT ON TAPE!
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: BUT EVEN IF THE
PRESIDENT HADN'T SWITCHED THE
DATES COULDN'T PEACH WATCH ONE
THING AND RECORD THE OTHER?
>> SURE, THEN YOU CAN PULL A
RABBIT OUT OF YOUR MAGIC
TELEVISION BEFORE DRIVING YOUR
FLYING CAR TO YOUR HOTEL ON THE
MOON.
DON'T FORGET TO BREAK FOR
UNICORNS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT IS SCIENCE
FICTION/FANTASY.
(LAUGHTER)
RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: I'M... LIKE TIVO,
D.V.R., YOU CAN... EVERYONE HAS
ONE.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
BUT WHO'S GOING TO WATCH THE
SPEECH OR THE DEBATE WHEN
THEY'VE GOT ALL THE SHOWS THEY
ACTUALLY LIKE RIGHT AT THEIR
FINGERTIPS?
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: WHAT'S WITH ALL THE
GHOST SHOWS?
WHY IS...
>> I LOVE GHOSTS, JON!
YOU THINK POLITICS IS THE ONLY
THING I'M INTERESTED IN?
I'M A GHOST GUY!
THEY'RE MY THING.
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER,
EVERYBODY.
>> WHERE IS HEY, WHOA, WHOA, DID
YOU JUST FEEL A COLD WIND?
I THINK THERE'S A GHOST IN HERE!
QUICK, CATCH IT ON TAPE!
HOLD MY HAND!
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER,
