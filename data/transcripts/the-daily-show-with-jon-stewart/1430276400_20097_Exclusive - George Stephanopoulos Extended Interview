IT'S MORE OF THE24 HOURS, AND WHO MAKES THE
DECISIONS TO LIKE GO FIVE HOURSWALL-TO-WALL ON THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENCE DINNER WHILEBALTIMORE IS HAVING, YOU KNOW,
A VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION?

>> IF YOU'RE PUTTING IN THATMUCH TIME, SURE. NO, NO.
>> Jon: SO, THEY'RE BEING -- ITIS SORT OF LIKE ALMOST LIKE A
PUNISHMENT LIKE BEING MADE TO DOKP -- THEY ARE SAD ABOUT IT.
>> EXCEPT WHAT THEY GET ISAIRTIME.
THAT'S THE TRADE-OFF.
>> Jon: OH, SO IT'S -- SO THEFEELING IS, IT IS OKAY THAT THIS
IS BAD, BECAUSE PEOPLEWILL SEE MY FACE.
>> AND THEN YOU TRY TO MAKE ITAS GOOD AS YOU CAN
BUT IT IS KIND OF TOUGH.
I MEAN, I THINK YOU AREABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO FOCUS ON,
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THEEXCESSES OF THE COVERAGE,
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF TOUGHWHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE TRYING
TO FILM THAT MUCH TIME.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT'S WHAT IDON'T UNDERSTAND.
SO I WONDER, SO THEY DIDN'TCOVER IT AT ALL -- THEN THE
NEXT TIME THAT HAPPENED THEYWENT FULL TEAM, LIKE ALL RIGHT,
JUST STAND OUTSIDE FOR FIVEHOURS AND NARRATE.
AND SO THERE'S NO CONTEXT -->> EVEN WHEN NOTHING NEW IS
HAPPENING.
>> Jon: CORRECT. AND NOPERSPECTIVE. SO --
>> BUT THAT'S GOT TO BETHE JOB, THAT'S WHERE I PUT IT
BACK ON US, WHEN WE'RE INSITUATIONS LIKE THAT,
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS BRINGCONTEXT, BRING PERSPECTIVE,
BRING A SENSE OF HISTORY -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TRY TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYINGPROBLEMS
IN ADDITION TO NARRATING WHAT ISHAPPENING ON THE SCREEN.
>> Jon: BUT IS THE ISSUE,THEN, WOULD YOU SAY IT'S,
WHO DECIDES, DO YOU GET TODECIDE ON "THIS WEEK" WHAT
YOU ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT?
>> WELL, FOR THE MOST PART, IMEAN, IT'S A COLLABORATIVE
EFFORT, YOU WORK WITH YOURPRODUCERS AND EXECUTIVES --
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BUT SURE, ON "THIS WEEK"
I WOULDN'T DO SOMETHING I WASN'TREALLY COMFORTABLE WITH.
>> Jon: ON THE 24 HOURS,WOULD THEY SAY TO SOMEBODY LIKE
HEY, MAN, WE'RE DOING SIX HOURSON BALTIMORE, AND THEY'RE LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SIXHOURS THERE --
>> I DON'T THINK THEY GOINTO IT SAYING WE'RE DEFINITELY
GOING TO DO SIX HOURS --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THEY SAY THIS IS ASTORY, THIS IS HAPPENING,
THIS IS REAL. THE PICTURES ARECOMPELLING.
WE ARE GOING STAY ON IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
SO IT'S NOT INSTITUTIONALCONTROL.
>> THEY DON'T GO AND SAY IT'SDEFINITELY GOING TO BE SIX
HOURS.>> Jon: IS THERE LIKE A LARGE,
I DON'T WANT TO SAYREPTILIAN-LIKE CREATURE
IN A BOOTH WHO LIKE,LIKE -- BECAUSE THESE POOR,
A LOT OF THESE JOURNALISTS, THEYARE REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE AND
THEY GOT IN THIS BUSINESS TOTELL GOOD STORIES TO, YOU KNOW,
TRY TO HELP BRING LIGHT TOTHINGS --
>> AND TRY TO FIND THEM TOO,YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT IS THERE SOMEBODYWHO LIKE SITS UP THERE AND
GOES STAY WITH IT?
>> YOU KNOW, IT ALL, LIKE, LIKESO MANY OF THESE THINGS IT DOES
COME BACK TO US, THOUGH, ANDWHEN I SAY US,
I MEAN ALL OF US, BECAUSE PARTOF THAT JUDGMENT IS BASED ON,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WATCHINGTWITTER, WATCHING WHO IS
WATCHING AT HOME AND THEY GETTHE SENSE THAT PEOPLE REALLY
ARE STAYING WITH THIS.
>> Jon: BUT EVEN TO THAT POINT.
SO WHEN THEY WEREDOING THAT FULL LIKE RED-CARPET
THING ON THE WHITE HOUSECORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
>> THAT'S CRAZY! THAT'S --
>> Jon: BUT THEY WERE READING,THE WERE READING TWITTER,
LIKE WE ARE LOOKING ON TWITTERAND THEY ARE TELLING US
TO (BLEEP) OFF.
AND TO NOT COVER THIS AND TO DOSOMETHING DIFFERENT.
ANYWAY -- YOU KNOW? AND IT'SLIKE --
>> BUT, BUT -- THAT'S MY POINTABOUT THE OBSESSION WITH
THE WHITE HOUSECORRESPONDENTS' -- LISTEN, I GO,
I HAVE BEEN GOING FOR YEARS ANDYEARS AND YEARS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK SO MUCH OF WHATPEOPLE SEE WHEN THEY'RE
WATCHING FIVE HOURS OF THAT ONTELEVISION --
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IS EXACTLY WHAT THEYHATE ABOUT WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.YEAH, IS IT HARD NOT TO GET THAT
ON YOU? I FOUND THAT WHENEVERI --
IT IS HARD NOT TO GETWASHINGTON ON YOU BECAUSE THE
ONLY TOWN I HAVE EVER BEEN TOTHAT IS AS DELUDED AS WASHINGTON
IS LOS ANGELES.
>> YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU WEREGOING TO SAY THAT, YEAH.
>> Jon: AND HONESTLY LIKE, WHERETHEY,  THEY THINK --
>> EVERYTHING REVOLVES AROUNDYOU.
>> Jon: RIGHT. I REMEMBER DOINGTHE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS'
DINNER AS A COMEDIAN AND THEY'RELIKE BE CAREFUL.
AND I'M LIKE, OH,  I WON'T GETREELECTED? LIKE WHAT, I DON'T --
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO ITAFTER DOING IT ONCE, RIGHT?
>> Jon: NO YOU DON'T WANT TODO IT AFTER DOING IT ONCE.
IT IS WORSE THAN THE OSCARSBECAUSE IN THE OSCARS
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY TELL YOUWHAT TO DO AND DON'T
EVER GO -- LIKE AT THE WHITEHOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER,
THEY ARE ALL WAY MORE TOUCHY.
IT IS CRAZY.
>> OH, THAT IS FOR SURE.
>> Jon: YEAH. WAY MORESENSITIVE.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUTTHAT. I THINK OBAMA HAS OPENED
THINGS UP THERE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE IS SO FREE IN
HIS -->> Jon: AS A COMEDIAN?
>> AS A COMEDIAN. YEAH, EXACTLY!
>> Jon: YES.
NO HE, HE IS A REALLY GOODCOMEDIAN.
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN HOPE ANDCHANGE WE DIDN'T KNOW THE HOPE
WAS VAUDEVILLE.
BUT UH, IT ALWAYS STRIKES ME --AND THERE IS THIS STRANGE SORT
OF HAND-WRINGING THAT GOES ALONGWITH IT AND GOES ALONG WITH ALL
THE COVERAGE WHERE PEOPLE WILLSAY, GOD, YOU KNOW,
WE ARE DOING THIS AGAINTHIS YEAR AND --
>> AND WE FEEL BETTERABOUT OURSELVES BY FEELING
BAD ABOUT OURSELVES.
>> Jon: THAT'S CORRECT. AND IWONDER, SO WHAT IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE STRUCTURALCHANGE OF THAT?
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST SAYWE ARE NOT DOING THAT --
>> AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO SAYYOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT
OR NOT GOING TO DO IT TO THATDEGREE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK YOUCOULD HAVE MADE THAT JUDGMENT
THIS YEAR.
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE -- IT'SGREAT TO FOLLOW THE SPEECHES --
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THE JOKES.
DOES IT THE REALLY DESERVERED-CARPET COVERAGE.
>> Jon: OH I THOUGHT PEOPLELOOKED TERRIFIC.
>> MY WIFE LOOKED GREAT.>> Jon: SHE DID LOOK GREAT.
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKEBALTIMORE, IS IT, YOU KNOW,
IT IS AS THOUGH THIS EXPLOSIONOF VIOLENCE HAPPENED
OUT OF NOWHERE.
THAT IT IS THE BIG BANG, THATSUDDENLY GASSES CAME TOGETHER
AND THAT WE HAVE HAD NO LEADUP.
THIS IS A CITY THAT IS, AND DCIS IN A VERY SIMILAR POSITION,
SYSTEMIC DISENFRANCHISEMENT  OFAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES,
POVERTY, EDUCATION, DEFICITS.
WE DON'T REALLY HEAR MUCH ABOUTIT.
>> WE WERE JUST, WE WERE JUSTMAKING FUN OF PRESIDENT OBAMA
BUT I THINK HE GAVE AVERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT TODAY
WHEN HE DID TALK ABOUT,WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT IS A SLOW
ROLLING CRISIS IN COMMUNITIESALL ACROSS AMERICA AND WE ONLY
PAY ATTENTION, AS YOU AREPOINTING OUT TONIGHT WHEN IT IS
ON FIRE AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T -- BUT THE PROBLEMWITH THESE ISSUES IS THEY ARE
TOUGH TO GET AT.
IT TAKES MONEY, AS YOU POINTOUT.
YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMY.
YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THEEDUCATION SYSTEM.
YOU DO HAVE TO FOCUS ON CRIME -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ONTHE FEELINGS THAT PEOPLE
HAVE IN THAT COMMUNITY, THAT THEPEOPLE
OUT THERE TO PROTECT THEM ARENOT PROTECTING THEM,
IN FACT SOMETIMES THEY ARETHEIR WORST ENEMY.
>> Jon: AND RIGHT NOW IT SEEMSTHE EASY THING TO DO IS TO SAY,
THERE ARE CRIMINALS ON THESTREETS AND THEY'RE
CREATING VIOLENCE.
LIKE THAT'S THE EASIEST THING INTHE WORLD TO DO AND NOT ADDRESS
IN ANY WAY.
>> IT'S TRUE, BUT IT IS NOTENOUGH.
>> Jon: IT IS NOT ENOUGH ATALL, AND IT IS A SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF IT, AND YOUJUST WONDER SOMETIMES IF WE ARE
SPENDING A TRILLION DOLLARSTO REBUILD AFGHANISTAN'S
SCHOOLS WE CAN'T THROW A LITTLETASTE DOWN BALTIMORE'S WAY?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S --
>> Jon: LIKE IS THAT, IS THATREALLY WHAT'S GOING ON?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> BUT SEE, BUT THIS IS WHAT --
>> Jon: IT IS CRAZY.
>> THIS IS WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZYAND THIS IS WHAT HASAN'S PIECE
WAS GETTING AT AS WELL.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU JUST GOT APPLAUSE WHENYOU SAID THAT LINE.
ANY SINGLE POLITICIAN IN THECOUNTRY
GETS APPLAUSE WHEN THEY SAY THATLINE YET IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
>> Jon: BECAUSE I THINKULTIMATELY WHAT THEY COUNT ON IS
THAT THOSE APPLAUSE LINES WILLBE OBSCURED BY THE REALITY OF
THE REAL POWER STRUCTURE WITHINWASHINGTON, WHICH IS FEEDING THE
BEAST THAT -- HILLARY CLINTONHAS THIS WHOLE SCANDAL NOW ABOUT
SOME -- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITHTHE CLINTONS? HILLARY CLINTON --
THEY ARE A COUPLE FROM ARKANSAS.
>> YEAH. THEY'VE BEEN AROUND ALONG TIME, HUH?
>> Jon: HAD A DAUGHTER, I CAN'TRECALL -- ANYWAY --
>> CUTE GRANDKIDS.
>> Jon: CUTE GRANDKIDS.
FOREIGN DONORS THATMIGHT HAVE GIVEN TO THE
CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE ANDTHEN THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
FAVORS DONE AT THE STATEDEPARTMENT AND IT IS TO THE TUNE
OF SOME, I THINK SOME MILLIONSOF DOLLARS.
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, I READ THEBOOK THAT THIS IS BASED ON
"CLINTON CASH" -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I ACTUALLY INTERVIEWEDTHE AUTHOR ON SUNDAY.
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE WHENYOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT,
LOOK CLOSELY AT IT, HE EVENSAYS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF
ANY DIRECT ACTION TAKENON BEHALF OF THE DONORS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT EVERYBODY ALSOKNOWS WHEN THOSE DONORS GIVES
THAT MONEY AND PRESIDENT CLINTONOR SOMEONE THEY GET A PICTURE
WITH THEM -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE IS A HOPE THAT IS GOINGTO LEAD TO SOMETHING.
>> Jon: OF COURSE.
>> AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TOBE CAREFUL OF.
>> Jon: MY POINT IS THOUGH THAT,SO THERE IS AN INDUSTRY AROUND
THIS, THE BOOK IS WRITTEN, THEGUY COMES ON YOUR SHOW, HE DOES
A BUNCH OF INTERVIEWS, HE DOES ABUNCH OF INTERVIEWS WITH OTHER
PEOPLE AND THEY ALL TALK ABOUTTHE SCANDAL OF
THESE FEW MILLIONS OF DOLLARSAND WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE LED TO,
IN THE SAME BREATH, SHEANNOUNCED I AM GOING TO
RAISE $2.5 BILLION ANDEVERYBODY WAS LIKE,
SHE IS SERIOUS.
NOW, WHAT DOES THAT MONEY BUY?
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE AREGETTING FOR THAT MONEY?
>> Jon: RIGHT. SO I DON'TUNDERSTAND THIS IDEA,
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BESHROUDED IN THAT TYPE OF
QUID PRO QUO OR THEAPPEARANCE OF IT.
>> OR, OR, OR, YOU KNOW, EVEN IFYOU DON'T GET AN ACTION,
WHAT YOU GET IS ACCESS AND YOUGET THE INFLUENCE THAT COMES
WITH ACCESS AND THAT HAS GOT TOSHAPE THE THINKING OF
POLITICIANS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS SOPERNICIOUS ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: CAN THROWING ROCKSAND LIGHTING THINGS ON FIRE
BE CONSIDERED LOBBYING?
>> I CAN'T SAY YES TO THAT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> I CAN'T.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU GOT -- DOYOU HAVE ANYTHING EXCITING
TOMORROW? DO YOU GOT ANYBIG GUESTS, ANY BIG INTERVIEWS?
IS THAT STILL A COMPETITIVETHING?
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME? SURE!
>> Jon: LIKE DID YOU WATCH THEJENNER INTERVIEW? BOY, THAT WAS
A GREAT INTERVIEW. DO YOU WATCHTHAT AND THINK,
OH I WOULD HAVE TORN THAT UP? IWOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT THERE.
OR DOES THAT STILL --
>> DIANE WAS PRETTY GREAT ATTHAT.
>> Jon: SHE WAS FINE, BUTJENNER WAS, LIKE THAT WAS --
>> IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
>> Jon: YOU SAW THE MAN'SHEART. YOU SAW THE MAN'S HEART.
>> YOU DID.
AND I THINK HE'S CHANGED A LOTOF MINDS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
IT IS AMERICA. NOT THAT MANY.
>> I HAVE MORE HOPE.>> Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD GO
ON TWITTER SOME TIME, YOU'LLSEE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF (BLEEP) MINDSOUT THERE.
BUT YOU DO, YOU CAN WATCH ANDTHINK LIKE I WISHED I SHOULD
HAVE SENT HIM A FRUIT BASKET.
>> I THINK SHE WAS THE RIGHT ONETO DO IT.
I ACTUALLY TALKED TO HIS FIRSTWIFE ON MONDAY.
>> Jon: OH YOU DID?
>> IT WAS ALSO REALLYINTERESTING.
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NOW --
>> HE TOLD HER SIX MONTHS INTOTHE MARRIAGE, AND THEY STAYED
MARRIED SIX YEARS AFTER THAT.
>> Jon: YES.
I MEAN IT IS CLEAR, BOY, THIS ISA GUY THAT IS -- OR, AND I AM
OBVIOUSLY MESSING UP --
>> YOU CAN STILL SAY GUY RIGHTNOW. RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE -- OKAY.
AND BUT -- HAS BEEN, JUST THEHEARTBREAK OF HAVING TO LIVE
WITH SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BEBUT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T.
>> AND THAT'S WHAT HE EXPLAINEDSO WELL I THINK.
>> Jon: HE EXPLAINED IT SO WELL.
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> AND IT REALLY MAKES YOU FEELLIKE,
FOR THE PEOPLE UPSETLIKE THAT, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.
WHY DO YOU CARE?
>> LET HIM BE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
YES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
