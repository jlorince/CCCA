>> THE EBOLA CASE IN NEW YORK, ACITY OF MORE THAN 8 MILLION.
>> EBOLA IN THE BIG APPLE.

SECOND. SO A DOCTORWHO TREATED EBOLA PATIENTS IN
AFRICA CAME BACK AND GOT HIMSELFEBOLA AND
[BLEEP] HIS WAY THROUGH THE "SEXAND THE CITY" TOUR IN MANHATTAN
WITH A 103 DEGREE FEVER.
>> WE WERE TOLD YESTERDAY THATIT WAS 103 IT WAS ACTUALLY
100.3.
>> Jon: DIDN'T ANYONE TREATINGHIM DOUBLE CHECK IT AND SEE?
THAT HE HAD A FEVER OF 100.3?
BECAUSE FROM THE LOOKS OF ITTHIS MAN IS HOT BLOODED.

VISITING A BOWLING ALLEY CALLEDTHE GUTTER.
>> Jon: WHY IS EBOLA'S GUY'SLIFE SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
THAN MINE? THE JOGGING, THEMEATBALLS, THE BOWLING.
THAT'S NOT A PATIENT HISTORYTHAT'S A TINDR PROFILE.
FOR GOD'S SAKES! IF YOU GOT AFEVER FOR LOVE, SWIPE RIGHT!
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY INNOCENTNEW YORKERS THIS MAN INFECTED IN
THAT, ALBEIT, AWESOME DAY.
>> UNLESS YOU HAD SEX WITHHIM, AT THE BOWLING ALLEY,
YOU WEREN'T GOING TO GETEBOLA.
[ Laughter ]>> Jon: I THINK I NEED TO CALL
MY DOCTOR.
[ Applause ]I BELIEVE THAT JOKE INTIMATED
THAT I [BLEEP] THE EBOLA DOCTOR.

SO MAYBE THE DISEASE LESSDANGEROUS AND DEVASTATING THAT
THE MEDIA HAS LED US TOBELIEVE I'M SURE THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES ARE TAKINGA MEASURED APPROACH.

>> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HAS SAID ATA PRESS CONFERENCE THAT SHE IS
ILL.

NO SHOWER AND A [BLEEP] BOX. ISTILL THINK MOST NEW YORKERS

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN?
ALL RIGHT.
I STAND CORRECTED.
I GUESS QUARANTINE AND TRAVELBANS ARE THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT
THE DISEASE.
>> THE IDEA OF A BLANKETQUARANTINE FOR PEOPLE WHO COME
BACK COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ANEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF
ESSENTIALLY DISINCENTIVISINGPEOPLE FROM WANTING TO GO THERE.
THE BEST WAY TO PROTECTAMERICANS IS TO STOP THE
EPIDEMIC IN AFRICA, ANDWE NEED THOSE HEALTH CARE
WORKERS TO DO THAT.
