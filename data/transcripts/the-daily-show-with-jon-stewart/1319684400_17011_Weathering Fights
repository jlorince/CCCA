COMEDY CENTRAL
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN!
WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST, OH, THIS IS TRUE,
PARTICLE PHYSICIST LISA RANDALL.
SO GET READY TO GET YOUR
LEARNING ON.
YO.
TRYING TO GET KIDS INTERESTED IN
SCIENCE.
WHAT UP, [BLEEPED]?
BUT FIRST WE'RE COMING UP ON THE
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF A SCANDAL
THAT ROCKED THE SCIENTIFIC
COMMUNITY.
NO, IT'S NOT THE DISCOVERY OF
ALBERT EINSTEIN'S LINGERIE
COLLECTION.
[LAUGHTER]
E EQUALS MC... I'M TALKING ABOUT
CLIMATE-GATE, THE 2009
CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING POSSIBLE
IRREGULARITIES IN CLIMATE
RESEARCH DATA.
>> SOME STOLEN E-MAILS ARE
GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT TO GLOBAL
WARMING SCEPTICS.
>> HACKERS SEIZED A FILE OF MORE
THAN 1,000 E-MAILS.
>> IN THOSE E-MAIL, SOME CLIMATE
SCIENTISTS SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING
THAT PERHAPS THEY'RE MASSAGING
THE DATA.
>> Jon: AH, AND THEN RELEASING
IT.
YES.
[LAUGHTER]
HACKED E-MAILS SUGGESTED THAT
SOME GLOBAL WARMING SCIENTISTS
WERE GUILTY OF MASSAGE WITH
RELEASE.
[LAUGHTER]
IRONICALLY GIVING THEIR CRITICS
ERECTIONS.
>> CLIMATE-GATE HAS REVEALED
THAT GLOBAL WARMING AND THAT
MOVEMENT IS RUN BY HACKS AND
FRAUDS.
>> THE GLOBAL WARMING HOAX
CONTINUES TO BE EXPOSED AND
DEBUNKED.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE
LEARNED THROUGH CLIMATE-GATE
WITH THE E-MAILS IS THIS IS AN
UNSETTLED SCIENCE.
>> PERHAPS IT MAY EVEN BE FRAUD.
>> Jon: POOR AL GORE, GLOBAL
WARMING COMPLETELY DEBUNKED VIA
THE VERY INTERNET YOU INVENTED.
[LAUGHTER]
ME FROM, REALLY, THAT'S ONLY TWO
YEARS AGO?
[LAUGHTER]
I'M AGING IN DOG YEARS.
WELL, SINCE CLIMATE-GATE, IT'S
NO SURPRISE THAT THE NUMBER OF
AMERICANS WHO BELIEVED IN GLOBAL
WARMING HAS BEEN DROPPING FROM 7
% IN 2006 TO ONLY 59% NOW.
IT'S CHANGE OF 20% OR MINUS 6.6%
CELSIUS OR 266 CALVIN PERCENT.
I GOT A SCIENTIST ON TONIGHT.
I'VE BEEN READING UP ON THIS
[BLEEPED] ALL DAY.
ALL RIGHT.
[APPLAUSE]
IF ONLY... IF ONLY AN IMPARTIAL
ARBITER COULD COME IN, REMOVE
THE WARMING DEBIT'S POLITICAL
IMPLICATIONS AND JUST EXAMINE
THE SCIENCE.
AND IF ONLY THAT PERSON COULD BE
FUNDED IN LARGE PART BY TWO
TITANS OF A SELDOM-HEARD
CONSTITUENCY OF THE GLOBAL
WARMING DEBATE, THE OIL
INDUSTRY.
[LAUGHTER]
YES, RICHARD MULLER, THE
BERKELEY PHYSIC'S PROFESSOR THAT
TOOK ON THE CHARGE OF
RE-EXAMINING CLIMATE DATA HAD AS
HIS BIGGEST PRIVATE FUNDERS, THE
KOCH BROTHERS.
NO, NOT THOSE TWO.
DIFFERENT COKE BROTHERS.
THOSE GUYS I DON'T EVEN THINK
ARE BROTHERS.
THAT'S THE GUYS.
CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH.
SO YOU SEE WHERE THIS RESEARCH
IS GOING.
SURE ENOUGH LAST WEEK SCEPTICAL
DOC MULLER ANNOUNCED HIS RESULTS
IN AN OP-ED IN THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL."
WHOA, GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL.
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.
YES, THE STUDY FUNDED BY THE
KOCH BROTHERS CONFIRMS THAT THE
ORIGINAL RESEARCH WAS ACTUALLY
CORRECT.
THE EARTH IS GETTING WARMER OR,
JUDGING BY THIS GRAPHIC, GETTING
MORE EMBARRASSED.
[LAUGHTER]
CLIMATE-GATE WAS A HUGE NEWS
STORY.
I BET DEBUNKING CLIMATE-GATE IS
GOING TO BE HOOSIER.
-- HOOSIER.
>> FOODIES OF THE WORLD REJOICE,
THE McRIB IS BACK.
>> TIME TO LITERALLY PIG OUT
AGAIN.
>> THE BONELESS BARBECUE PORK
SANDWICH WILL BE ON THE MENU
UNTIL NOVEMBER.
>> WE ALSO FOUND A McRIB
LOCATOR WEB SITE.
>> HOW EXCITED ARE YOU ABOUT THE
McRIB?
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S PORK
IN THE McRIB.
I THOUGHT IT WAS KOSHER.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THEY
REINTRODUCE THE McRIB EVERY
[BLEEPED] YEAR.
IT'S NOT BIG NEWS.
REINTRODUCING THE Mc-DLT OR
SHAMROCK SHAKES ALL YEAR LONG,
THAT'S BIG NEWS.
I DON'T GET THIS, MAN.
CLIMATE-GATE WAS HUGE NEWS.
THE DEBUNKING OF CLIMATE-GATE
GOT A TOTAL OF 24 SECONDS OF
CABLE NEWS COVERAGE.
