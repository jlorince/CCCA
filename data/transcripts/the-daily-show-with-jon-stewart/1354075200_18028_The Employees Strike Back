>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, WARREN BUFFETT AND FINANCIAL JOURNALIST CAROL LOOMIS.
THEY ARE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT AND -- TONIGHT MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS SHOW.
(LAUGHTER) THEY WROTE A BOOK TOGETHER, ACTUALLY.
AS YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ONE THING ALL AMERICANS CAN AGREE ON, WE LOVE BLACK FRIDAY.
WHETHER YOU'RE A FAN OF SHOPPING OR TRAMPLING.
(LAUGHTER) WHICH IS WHY I WAS JUST -- I WAS SO UPSET TO SEE ON THIS HOLIEST OF DAYS A NEWS STORY ABOUT
PEOPLE PROTESTING IN FRONT OF THEIR LOCAL WAL-MART.
>> THOUSANDS OF WAL-MART EMPLOYEES ARE STAGING WALKOUTS AND PROTESTS OVER THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND.
THE WORKERS ARE UPSET ABOUT HAVING TO WORK ON THANKSGIVING DAY AND THEY'RE ALSO SPEAKING
OUT FOR BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS.
>> Jon: WHAT?
(LAUGHTER) YOU GET TO WORK AT WAL-MART ON THANKSGIVING DAY!
(LAUGHTER) A RING SIDE SEAT TO THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.
>> I IT'S A BLACK FRIDAY TRADITION.
>> (BLEEP).
I'LL STAB ONE OF YOU MOTHER (BLEEP) (AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PEOPLE PAY TO GO TO FIGHTS LIKE THAT?
(LAUGHTER) YOU GET PAID -- SOME -- TO SEE IT.
(LAUGHTER) ISN'T THAT BENEFIT ENOUGH?
TRULY YOUR VEST RUNETH OVER.
(LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, GREEDY HOURLY SLIGHTLY OVER THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE EMPLOYEES.
(LAUGHTER) NOW YOU WANT TO UNIONIZE!
BESIDES, EVERYONE KNOWS COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING IN THE WAL-MART WORLD YOU'VE GOT IT
PRETTY GOOD.
>> VIOLENT PROTESTS IN BANGLADESH THIS MORNING AFTER A DEADLY GARMENT FACTORY FIRE.
SATURDAY'S FIRE KILLED AT LEAST 112 FACTORY WORKERS.
THE FACTORY IS OWNED BY AN EXPORTER WHOSE CLIENTS INCLUDE WAL-MART.
>> Jon: SEE?
(LAUGHTER) WAH-WAH!
"I WORK AT WAL-MART IN THE UNITED STATES!
I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE MY KIDS TO THE DOCTOR!" WELL, AT LEAST WHERE YOU WORK THERE ARE EXITS!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND THE WORST PART OF THAT FIRE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE WORST PART OF THAT FIRE IS THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON WAL-MART.
>> THIS IS A BIG GIANT PRIZE FOR UNIONS.
THIS IS A BIG GIANT PRIZE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ANTI-CAPITALISM.
IF IT'S NOT THIS, IT WILL BE SOMETHING ELSE.
>> I THINK IT'S A STRETCH, AN AMAZING STRETCH, TO TRY TO PIN THIS ON WAL-MART.
I CAN'T THINK OF A WORSE TARGET.
>> Jon: OH, I ACTUALLY -- I BELIEVE THAT'S WAL-MART'S SLOGAN: "THINK OF A WORSE
TARGET." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH, THAT WAS JOE.
JOE CAME UP WITH THAT IN THE MEETING AND WE'RE ALL LIKE "WE'RE USING THAT." (LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY.
YOU WERE BEING CALLUSLY DISMISSIVE ABOUT THE WORKING CONDITIONS IN BANGLADESH TO
SCORE POINTS AGAINST AMERICAN UNIONS.
CONTINUE.
>> DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE IN BANGLADESH WHO PERISHED DIDN'T WANT OR NEED THOSE JOBS
AS WELL.
I KNOW WE LIKE TO VICTIMIZE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO
THE POOR PROFIT MOTIVATION WHICH IS BEING ASSAULTED.
>> AGAIN, IT'S TRAGIC AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.
>> Jon: OKAY, THAT'S A RELIEF.
(LAUGHTER) YOUR FIRST ARGUMENT APPEARS TO BE "YES, OKAY, THEY DIED IN A FIRE BUT THEY HAD JOBS!"
(LAUGHTER) I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME YOUR JOB WON'T ENTAIL SOME KIND OF INFERNO UNLESS IT'S
MENTIONED IN THE AD WHICH IS -- OH, OKAY, WELL, THAT -- I DIDN'T REALIZE.
NOW YOUR SECOND ARGUMENT IS THIS -- (APPLAUSE).
YOUR SECOND ARGUMENT APPEARS TO BE -- YOUR SECOND ARGUMENT IS, "HEY, MAN, THIS IS JUST A
ONE-OFF." WHICH COULD BE A POWERFUL HYPOTHETICAL ARGUMENT THAT I MIGHT BUY INTO IF MOMENTS
EARLIER THE GIANT GRAPHIC NEXT TO YOUR HEAD HAD NOT MENTIONED THE 500 PEOPLE OVER THE PAST TWO
DECADES KILLED IN GARMENT FIRES.
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS YOU'RE JUST SAYING THIS TYPE OF FIRE WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN IN THIS PARTICULAR
NOW BURNED-DOWN FACTORY.
(LAUGHTER) TO WHICH I WOULD SAY
