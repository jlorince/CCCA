I WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT ON WHATWE HAVE BUILT HERE OVER THESE
PAST 16 YEARS.
WE WORKED AWFULLY HARD.
AND NOT EVERY SHOW HAS BEENUP TO SNUFF, BUT WE'VE
GIVEN IT OUR ALL EVERY SINGLETIME.
THAT IS THE THING THATIMPRESSES ME MOST.
EVERYBODY GIVES IT ALL.
AND I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE'VEBUILT HERE IS A MONUMENT TO...
EVISCERATION.
(LAUGHTER)
ISSUES, PUNDITS, POLITICIANS --WE HERE AT THE SHOW LEFT NO
TARGET UN-DISEMBOWELED.
IN FACT, IF YOU ARE STILLWALKING AROUND WITH A BELLY
FULL OF VISCERA, KNOW THIS,WE DIDN'T FORGET YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL PUT IT ALL UP ON THE WEB.
AND BY THE WAY, IT WASN'TJUST EVISCERATING.
WE DEMOLISHED, CRUSHED.
WE ANNIHILATEED THINGS.
I CAN REMEMBER ONE NIGHT,EVEN THE HULK WAS LIKE DUDE,
HEY, SLOW DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, HULK ANGRY, BUT PLEASED.
AND SO NOW AT THE END OF MYTENURE, WITH ALL MY TARGETS,
PULVERIZED INTO ASH BEFOREME, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A

DEVASTATING LASER-GUIDED SATIRE.
DEATH BULDOZERS SWEEPINGIN ON A SAND STORM WHILE FIRING
HIGH EXPLOSIVES?
THESE GUYS AREN'T TACTICALGENIUSES.

GRIM VIEW OF THE WAR WITH ISIS,SUGGESTING THE GROUP MAY BE
JUST AS STRONG NOW AS IT WAS AYEAR AGO--

(LAUGHTER)
I KNOW THE PROBLEM, ISIS ISSPOTTY REGIONAL ACCESS TO BASIC
CABLE.

WELL, ANYWAY, THAT IS NOTTHE ONLY PROBLEM WE BOARED
THROUGH WITH OUR DIAMOND TIPDRILL BIT OF RIDICULE.
RACE RELATIONS! A SUBJECT ADECADE AGO WAS RADIATING A
CHERNOBYL LEVEL OF TOXICITYUNTIL WE HERE AT THE DAILY
SHOW JUDO CHOPPED IT INTO AMILLION LITTLE PIECES.
THE COPS GOT TO USE THE"N" WORD FOR IT TO BE RACISM?
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THE PHRASE APICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND
EPITHETS.
DID YOU JUST, HE WHOSMELT IT DEALT IT RACISM?

YOU CAN'T SAY ONLY BLACKLIVES MATTER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: [BLEEP].
GOD, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST MOVE ON ITANOTHER ONE OF MY CLASSIC
ADVERSARIES, THE BIG BANKS.
NO ONE HAS YET BEEN HELDACCOUNTABLE FOR THE 2008
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
A NEW SEGMENT WE CALL, HOWTHE [BLEEP] IS IT THAT
MARTHA STEWART WENT TO JAIL?
WALL STREET IS MAD ASHELL!
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TOTAKE IT ANYMORE!
UNLESS BY "IT," YOU MEAN $2TRILLION IN THEIR OWN
BAILOUT MONEY.
IF YOU ARE PART OF AFINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT
LAUNDERED THE MONEY THAT[BLEEP] WITH SPORT, YOU WILL
GO TO THE HAMPTONS OR SOMEOF YOU TO monster.com.
...AND STAY DOWN.
I DIDN'T JUST EVISCERATEWALL STREET, I BURNED THAT
BITCH TO THE GROUND, BULLDOZEDTHE ASPHALT, PAVED OVER THEM
AND BUILT AN ARBY'S ON TOP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
AN ARBY'S.
ARBY'S, A LOT MORE THAN YOUR401(k) IS GOING DOWN THE
TOILET.
(APPLAUSE)
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
LET'S SEE HOW THE FINANCIALINDUSTRY IS COPING IN THE
WAKE OF MY ONSLAUGHT.
>> A TRADER SENTENCED TO 14YEARS BEHIND BARS FOR HIS
ROLE IN THE GLOBALCONSPIRACY TO RIG INTEREST
RATES.
TOM HAYES WAS FOUND GUILTYOF TRYING TO MANIPULATE RATES
DURING FOUR YEARS AT UBS ANDCITY GROUP.
HE WAS THE FIRST BANKER TO BETRIED, HE RECEIVED ONE OF THE
HASHEST PENALTIES AGAINST ABANKER SINCE THE FINANCIAL
CRISIS.
>> Jon: TAKE THAT, ONE GUY!
CRIME DOESN'T PAY.
UNLESS YOU ARE ANYONE OTHERTHAN THAT ONE GUY.
(LAUGHTER)
PERHAPS FOX NEWS, THE BEST KNOWNTARGET IN OUR SHOW'S PROVERBIAL
CROSS HAIRS, PAID THE ULTIMATEPRICE.
THEIR SPRITE DRIVEN ANGERMACHINE ROUTED IN THE FEAR
THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE STAT STATUS QUO WILL INEVITABLY
ERODE THE POWER STRUCTURE.
WHERE CAN THE FEAR BECOMING FROM.
I GUESS-- OH, GOD.
CHAOS ON BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN!
WE REPORT, YOU CAN SUCK IT.
YOU ARE THE LUPUS OF NEWS.
GO (BLEEP) YOURSELVES, NOW!GO (BLEEP) YOURSELVES, NOW!
NOT ONLY DID I TAKE DOWNFOX NEWS, I DID IT WITH THE
POWER OF SONG.
