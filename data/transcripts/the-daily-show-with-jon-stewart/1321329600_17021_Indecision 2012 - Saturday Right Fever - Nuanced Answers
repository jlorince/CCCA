WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
FOR MORE ON THESE THREE
REPUBLICANS, WE'RE JOINED BY
SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT
AASIF MANDVI.
AASIF....
>>
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, WATCHING
THIS DEBATE, SOME OF THESE
GUYS ARE KILLING IT.
THEY'RE DOING RED MEAT.
WHAT WAS UP WITH HUNTSMAN,
BACHMANN AND SANTORUM.
>> JON, THEIR NUANCED ANSWERS
TO REAL WORLD PROBLEMS WAS A
HUGE GAFFE.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR
CAMPAIGNS WILL SURVIVE IT.
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANYWAY FOR THEM TO SPIN
MASTERY OF THE ISSUES AS A
KIND OF STRENGTH?
>> IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY,
NO.
KNOWLEDGE IS LIKE KRYPTONITE
HERE.
IT SAPS YOUR CONFIDENCE AND
WEAKENS YOUR TALKING POINTS.
HERE'S RICK PERRY WHEN HE WAS
LEADING THE RACE.
>> ANYBODY THAT IS FOR THE
STATUS QUO WITH SOCIAL
SECURITY TODAY IS INVOLVED
WITH A MONSTEROUS LIE.
IT IS A PONZI SCHEME.
>> Jon: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
>> Reporter: FORCEFUL.
>> Jon: LACKED COHERENCE.
>> Reporter: TOTALLY OFF BASE.
THEY LOVED IT.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PERRY
HAS TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE HE
ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT.
>> IF YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD
NOT EDUCATE CHILDREN WHO HAVE
COME INTO OUR STATE FOR NO
OTHER REASON THAN THEY'VE BEEN
BROUGHT THERE BY NO FAULT OF
THEIR OWN, I DON'T THINK YOU
HAVE A HEART.
TEXANS VOTED ON IT.
AND I STILL SUPPORT IT
GREATLY.
(CHEERING AND BOOS).
>> Reporter: YEAH, YEAH.
TOO PRAGMATIC.
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS
ELECTRIFIED ALLIGATOR MOAT.
>> Jon: NICE.
ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT EXPENSIVE.
YOU GET YOUR....
>> Reporter: BUT, BUT, BUT,
BUT SEE THAT'S THE KIND OF
OBSESSING OVER DETAILS THAT
SANK PERRY.
NO ONE WANTS A GOVERNOR WHO
GRAPPLES WITH THE REALITIES OF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
THEY WANT THE GOVERNOR WHO
FIGHTS WILD FIRES BY PRAYING
FOR RAIN.
>> Jon: WHY DOES KNOWLEDGE OF
ISSUES AND FACTS, WHY IS IT A
DETRIMENT?
>> IT PINS YOU DOWN, JON.
IT FORCES YOU TO DEAL WITH A
POTENTIAL CANDIDATE'S WORST
ENEMY: REALITY.
WITHOUT IT, YOU'RE FLYING
HIGH.
NO MONEY FOR PAKISTAN.
SHOVE IT, CHINA.
BUT THEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH A
COUPLE OF INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEES AND MAYBE GET
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE
SITUATION AND PRETTY SOON, IF
WE HAVE MILITARY AID WITH A
STRONG DOMESTIC...
(SCREAMING).
>> Jon: SO KNOWING STUFF,
REALIZING THE REALITY OF YOUR
SITUATION, IS THE ENEMY.
>> WELL IT JUST COMPLICATES
YOUR DECISION-MAKING.
LET'S TRY A THOUGHT
EXPERIMENT, OKAY.
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: OH, I LIKE THAT.
THAT'S NICE.
>> YOU'VE TRACKED A TERRORIST
TO HIS LAIR.
YOU'LL KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE
UNTIL YOU BLOW THEM UP WITH A
DRONE.
WHAT DO YOU DO.
>> Jon: RELEASE THE DRONE.
>> YOU JUST GOT INFORMATION
THAT HIS LAIR IS A
KINDERGARTEN FULL OF CHILDREN.
DO YOU STILL WANT TO BLOW IT
UP NOW?
>> Jon: NO, NO.
SEND IN THE SEAL TEAMS, GET
THE KIDS OUT AND THEN....
>> THINK AGAIN.
THINK AGAIN BECAUSE THE KIDS
ARE ROBOT DECOYS FILLED WITH
NERVE GAS.
SEALS WON'T LAST TEN SECONDS
IN THERE.
>> Jon: (BEEP) THE KIDS.
SEND THE DRONES BACK IN.
GOING WITH THE DRONES.
>> BAD NEWS.
THAT KINDERGARTEN IS ON TOP OF
A DAM.
YOU BLOW IT UP, THE
TOWNSPEOPLE BELOW WILL DROWN.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD YOU BILL A
KINDERGARTEN ON TOP OF A DAM?
>> STAY FOCUSED,
MR. PRESIDENT.
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
LET'S GO.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS.
SNIPER TAKES OUT THE
TERRORIST.
SWAT TEAM SECURES THE DAM.
YES, THE TOWN IS SAVED.
>> YES, CONGRATULATIONS.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'D MAKE AN EXCELLENT
PRESIDENT.
>> ONE OF THE WOMEN YOU SAVED
FROM DROWNING WAS PREGNANT
WITH ADOLPH HITLER.
WELL DONE.
>> Jon: DAM IT.
YOU NEVER SAID THIS WAS IN THE
PAST.
>> YOU SEE HOW MUCH MORE
DECISIVE YOU WERE THOUGH WHEN
YOUR MIND WASN'T CAUGHT UP
WITH FACTS.
YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE
HOLOCAUST.
>> Jon: I GUESS A LITTLE
KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS
THING.
>> AND I GUESS VOTING FOR
HERMAN CAIN IS THE ONLY WAY TO
PREVENT THE HOLOCAUST.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
