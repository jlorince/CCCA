>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. TONIGHT'SGUEST THE GREATEST, THE GREATEST
RELIEF PITCHER IN BASEBALLHISTORY MARIANO RIVERA IS
GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THEPROGRAM LATER ON TONIGHT.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THATBUT --
[LAUGHTER]I SAID THE BUT REALLY LOUD,
DIDN'T I?
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, SCAREDSOME PEOPLE.
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE NEWS.
BECAUSE LATE LAST WEEK IT ALLWENT DOWN.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE ON THEDEFENSE OVER A NEW SMOKING GUN
BENGHAZI E-MAIL.
>> SOME ARE CALLING A SMOKINGGUN.
>> THE SMOKING GUN.
>> Jon: SMOKING GUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT'S ONE OF WORST KINDS OF GUNS.
[LAUGHTER]A GUN THAT SMOKES.
ITS A TERRIBLE INFLUENCE.
[LAUGHTER]ALL THE OTHER GUNS THAT JUST
HAVING A GOOD TIME.
THEY ARE NOT SMOKING, NOTDRINKING AND THEN THAT GUN WALKS
IN.
COME ON, ALL THE COOL GUNS AREDOING IT.
[ LAUGHTER ] NOW WE WENT INTO IRAQ BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T WANT THE SMOKING GUN TOBE IN THE FORM OF A
MUSHROOM CLOUD. WHAT WASTHIS GUN SMOKING?
>> THE CONSERVATIVE WATCH DOGGROUP JUDICIAL WATCH OBTAINED
INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE E-MAILSTHAT IT CLAIMS REVEAL MORE ABOUT
THE EFFORT TO GET THEN U.N.AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE TO ASSERT
ON THE SUNDAY MORNING TALK SHOWSTHAT THE ATTACK ON THE
U.S. CONSULATE WAS THE RESULT OFA DEMONSTRATION OVER AN
INTERNET VIDEO AND NOT A FAILUREOF ADMINISTRATION POLICY.
>> Jon: HUH.
MAN, THAT IS DIFFERENT. THEWHITE HOUSE HAD SAID THEY HAD
VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH CHANGINGTHE TALKING POINTS. WELL, NOW
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS BEN RHODES AWHITE HOUSE NATIONAL
SECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS AIDEDID ADD TO THE TALKING POINTS,
EMPHASIZING THAT THE PROTESTSSURROUNDING THE BENGHAZI
VIOLENCE WERE NOT COORDINATED BYTERRORISTS BUT WERE INSTEAD
SOMEHOW RELATED TO A PROVOCATIVEANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO THAT HAD
CAUSED DEMONSTRATIONS IN OTHERCOUNTRIES. BY THE WAY,
THAT VIDEO, SNOW DOGS.
IT REALLY IS A TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE VIDEO.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, I WILL SAY THIS, FROM THAT
E-MAIL IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WHITEHOUSE -- WELL DONE.
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD POLITICS ANDELECTIONS ON THEIR MIND WHEN
THEY SENT SUSAN RICE TO THESUNDAY SHOWS.
IT'S DEPLORABLE.
NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMSOF FIXING THE INITIAL PROBLEMS
OF INADEQUATE COMMUNICATION ANDPROTECTION THAT CAUSED THE
TRAGEDY BUT OKAY. GOOD FIND.MOVING ON.
>> WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVERTHOSE FOUR DEAD AMERICANS?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT NOW?
>> WE NOW KNOW THAT THE WHITEHOUSE HAD A CONSPIRACY WHERE
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY WERETRYING TO DO WAS CHANGE THE
STORY.
>> WILL THE MAINSTREAM MEDIAEVEN PAY ATTENTION?
>> THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA ISGIVING PRESIDENT OBAMA A PASS ON
BENGHAZI.
WHERE WAS THAT OUTRAGE?
THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITEHOUSE CREATED A POLITICAL
AGENDA.
>> WHERE IS THE MEDIA OUTRAGE?
>> THEY KNEW IT WAS A TERRORISTATTACK FROM THE GET GO.
>> NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE.
>> FOX NEWS IS THE ONLY ONE THATSTAYED ON THE STORY AND HAS NOT
LET GO OF IT.
>> WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE THERE?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: OKAY.
I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]YOU THINK PEOPLE'S FAILURE TO
MATCH YOUR LEVEL OF OUTRAGE ISBASED ON IGNORANCE THAT AFTER
NEARLY 100 NETWORK NEWS STORIES,HUNDREDS OF CABLE NEWS STORIES
ABOUT BENGHAZI 13 CONGRESSIONALHEARINGS, 50 FURTHER
CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS AND
25,000 PAGES OF OFFICIALFINDINGS CONCERNING WHAT
HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI THAT IF WEALL ONLY KNEW ABOUT IT --
[LAUGHTER]-- WE WOULD CARE.
[LAUGHTER]YOU KNOW, THERE ARE VERY FEW
THINGS WE'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT INTHE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.
THE ONLY THING WE'VE HEARD ABOUTIN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.
THE ONLY THING WE'VEHEARD MORE ABOUT MAYBE
THE KARDASHIANS AND THERE IS, THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THIS
SITUATION WAS SPAWNED BY THERELEASE OF THE VIDEO.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYQUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINK
THAT -- I THINK I SEE THEPROBLEM. HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM,
YOU ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GETOUTRAGED ABOUT AN INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE THAT TRAGICALLY LED TOSOME AMERICANS LOSING THEIR
LIVES.
ONE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE. ANDTHEN, I MEAN,
IMAGINE THE OUTRAGE IF THERE WASA SECOND FAILURE RIGHT AFTER
THAT ONE THAT TRAGICALLY LED TOEVEN MORE AMERICANS LOSING
THEIR LIVES? BUT, YOU ARE NOTCONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
YOU ARE JUST CONCERNED ABOUTTHIS ONE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE
AND YOU ARE UPSET THAT THEADMINISTRATION IN ITS HASTE TO
GET REELECTED PULLED SOME DODGYFACE SAVING (bleep).
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE AFRAIDOF. WELL, I COMMEND YOU FOR
FINALLY GETTING IN TOUCH WITHYOUR INNER OUTRAGE BECAUSE
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE
IT WAS AN EMOTION YOU DIDN'TSEEM COMFORTABLE
ADDRESSING OR EXPRESSING. LIKE,FOR INSTANCE WHEN FORMER BUSH
HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARYTOM RIDGE SAID HE WAS
PRESSURED BY ASHCROFT ANDRUMSFELD TO RAISE THE
NATION'S TERROR THREAT LEVELBEFORE THE 2004 ELECTION TO
HELP PRESIDENT BUSH'S ELECTIONCHANCES.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?
>> WELL, TOM RIDGE IS A GOOD ANDDECENT MAN ENTITLED TO HIS
IMPRESSIONS BUT THERE'RE JUSTTHAT AND THERE ARE SOME FACTS
THAT STAND BETWEEN TOM RICH ANDTHE SMOKING GUN.
>> IF FORMER HOMELANDSECURITY CHIEF TOM RIDGE
WAS HOPING TO GENERATE BUZZABOUT HIS UPCOMING
BOOK, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
>> Jon: ZING.
THAT'S NOT OUTRAGE.
THAT IS SNARK.
SNARK IS NOT OUTRAGE, SILLY. [LAUGHTER]
