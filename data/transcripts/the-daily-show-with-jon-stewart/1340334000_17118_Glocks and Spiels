( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JOB STEWART.
WOW, DO WE HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, BASSEM YOUSSEF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU HEAR THAT?
THE CROWD FROM EGYPT GOES WILD.
A SAT TIRIST FROM EEGYPT, WHERE CIVILIZATION BEGAN, WHERE HUMOR BEGAN, ENTIRE SHOW,
HIEROGLYPHICS, TREMENDOUS.
WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE HIM HERE TODAY.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE CONTROVERSY REGARDING ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER.
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET YOU CAUGHT UP ON IT AS QUICK PLEA AS WE CAN.
IT ALL BEGAN WITH AN A.T.F. PROGRAM CALLED FAST AND FURIOUS IN WHICH THE USE
GOVERNMENT ALLOWED GUNS TO BE SMUGGLED TO MEXICAN DRUG RUNNERS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHERE
MEXICAN DRUG RUNNERS WERE GETTING THEIR GUNS.
( LAUGHTER ) IT TURNED OUT TO BE-- IT TURNED
OUT TO BE FROM OUR GOVERNMENT.
THEY ACTUALLY-- CIRCLE OF LIFE.
ANY-WHOOO, WE LOST TRACK OF ABOUT-- HOLD ON, HOLD ON-- 2,000 GUNS.
ALTHOUGH, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, WE DID END UP FINDING ONE OF THEM WHEN IT WAS USED TO KILL A U.S.
BORDER PATROL AGENT.
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, WHISTLE BLOWERS BEGAN TO BLOW WHISTLES.
CONGRESS ULTIMATELY ASKED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THE DETAILS OF THIS FAST AND ACTUALLY
SOMEWHAT CURIOUS PROGRAM TO WHICH THE D.O.J. RESPONDED IN FEBRUARY 2011, PROGRAM?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM.
I NEVER HEARD-- LET ME LOOK FOR THE LETTER "F" FAST AND FIZZY,
FARTS AND AT THAT POINTA.
NOPE, NO FAST AND FURIOUS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
ABOUT A MONTH LATER, CBS BREAKS THE STORY OF THE PROGRAM PUBLICLY AT WHICH POINT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAITS ANOTHER NINE MONTHS AND WITHDRAWS THE FIRST LETTER AND SENDS CONGRESS
A NEW LETTER SAYING, OH, FAST AND FURIOUS.
( LAUGHTER ) YEAH.
WE HAVE THAT.
WE'VE JUST-- WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT DONDESUSPICIOUS
