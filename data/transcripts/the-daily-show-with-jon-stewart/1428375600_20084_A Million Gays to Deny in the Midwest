BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLYTHING.
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF, IRANHAPPENING, ALL THESE THINGS
AND THIS HAPPENED LAST WEEK.
>> INDIANA'S GOVERNOR MIKEPENCE SURROUNDED BY NUNS,
FRANCISCAN MONKS ANDORTHODOX JEWS SIGNED
SOMETHING CALLED THERELIGIOUS FREEDOM
RESTORATION ACT INTO LAW.
>> SUPPORTERS SAY ITPROTECTS A PERSON OR
BUSINESS OWNER FROMGOVERNMENT PERSECUTION WHEN
FOLLOWING THEIR RELIGIOUSBELIEFS.
>> Jon: HERE, HERE!
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT PEOPLEIN INDIANA COULD NOT
PRACTICE RELIGION.
I'M EXCITED.
I THOUGHT YOU COULD PRACTICERELIGION IN INDIANA BUT
APPARENTLY IT IS UP TO NOWBEEN ILLEGAL,
ONE OF THOSE QUIRKYLOCAL LAWS, I GUESS.
BUT WELL, GOD BLESS, ALL'SWELL THAT ENDS WELL.
>> CRITICS SAY IT IS ATHINLY VEILED DISGUISE FOR
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAYPEOPLE, ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING
BUSINESSES TO DENY THEMSERVICES FOR RELIGIOUS
REASONS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]?(LAUGHTER)
WAIT, DENYING GAY PEOPLE FROMRELIGIOUS -- GAY
PEOPLE AREN'T ASKING YOU TOMAKE THEM A GAY PRODUCT.
THEY'RE JUST ASKING TO BUYTHE PRODUCT YOU MAKE.
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS THATEXPLAINS THE SIGNS IN SO
MANY INDIANA STOREFRONTS.
(LAUGHTER)I CAN'T IMAGINE INDIANA
WOULD GET AWAY WITH THISTYPE OF DISCRIMINATION.
>> EVEN THE NCAA IS COMINGOUT AGAINST THE MEASURE JUST
DAYS BEFORE THE STATE'SCAPITOL CITY HOSTS THE MEN'S
BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.
>> Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT.
WHEN ARE YOU BECOMECRITICIZED BY A COMPANY
WHOSE ENTIRE BUSINESS MODELIS BASED ON EXPLOITATION.
YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATEAGAINST GAYS, YOU CAN PROFIT
ON THEIR LIKENESS WITHOUTCOMPENSATION.
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S HOW YOU CANGET AWAY WITH IT.
JUST CALL THEM STUDENT GAYS.
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARETHINKING WELL WHO NEEDS THE
NCAA ANYWAY, NOT US ININDIANA, WELL THAT IS WHEN THE
BIG GUNS CAME OUT.
>> ANGIE'S LIST C.E.O. SAYS THECOMPANY'S EXPANSION PROJECT
IN INDIANAPOLIS IS ON HOLD.
>> Jon: [BLEEP] JUST GOT REAL.
WITHOUT ANGIE'S LIST, HOWARE YOU GOING TO FIND A
TRUSTWORTHY CONTRACTOR TOREMODEL YOUR HOUSE?
CRAIGSLIST IS NO GOOD.
THEY WILL JUST DRESS YOURHOUSE UP AS A FURY AND RUB
THEMSELVES ON IT. YOUDON'T WANT THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT JUST RESONATEDWAY TOO HOT.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS, THE BACKLASH
WAS SO INTENSE INDIANAGOVERNOR MIKE PENCE HAD NO
CHOICE BUT TO RESPOND VERYSTUPIDLY.
>> DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BELEGAL IN THE STATE OF
INDIANA TO DISCRIMINATEAGAINST GAYS OR LESBIANS?
>> GEORGE, --
>> IT'S A YESOR NO QUESTION.
>> LOOK COME ON, HOOSIERS DON'TBELIEVE IN DISCRIMINATION.
THERE ARE NO KINDER, MOREGENEROUS, MORE WELCOMING,
MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE INAMERICA THAN IN THE 92
COUNTIES OF INDIANA.
>> Jon: BUT FIRST OF ALL,CAN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT
THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA LIKETHEY'RE A LOST TRIBE FROM
NOSTALGIA-STAN.
THE GOOD PEOPLE OFINDIANA, THEIR MOTTO IS
PLEASE AND THANK YOU AND THECURRENCY OF INDIANA IS A
HOMEMADE LEMON SQUARE.
(LAUGHTER)LET'S FACE IT, PEOPLE IN
INDIANA ARE NO NICER OR[BLEEP] THAN PEOPLE ANYWHERE
ELSE.
EXCEPT PHILLY, THAT'S THEWORST.
AND D.C.
ANY -- WELL REALLY IT'S ANY NLEAST CITY.
METS RULE!
WAIT, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUTAGAIN?
OH, INDIANA.
ANYWAY, IT SEEMS LIKE GOVERNORMIKE PENCE'S UNWAIVERING BELIEF
IN THE GOODNESS OF HOOSIERS DIDNEEDS SOME TWEAKING.
>> MIKE PENCE APPROVING CHANGESTO A CONTROVERSIAL NEW LAW.
>> THE NEW LANGUAGE ININDIANA SPELLS OUT THE LAW DOES
NOT AUTHORIZE A PROVIDERTO REFUSE TO OFFER OR PROVIDE
SERVICES ON THE BASIS OF SEXUALORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY.
>> Jon: ANY MORE.
CAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TODO.
AND YOU CAUGHT US.
YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TOBELIEVE THAT THE CHANGE IN
LANGUAGE CAME VIA A MORALEPIPHANY BUT MY GUESS IS IT'S
MORE OF A AND I WOULD HAVEGOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO IF IT
WEREN'T FOR YOU MEDDLING KIDS.
>> THE REASON THAT THOSECORPORATIONS PUT THE
PRESSURE ON INDIANA ANDARKANSAS WAS BECAUSE THE
MILITANT GAY COMMUNITY PUT THEPRESSURE ON THEM.
>> Jon: SHUT UP.
SO WHEN GAYS WANT EQUALITYIT'S MILITANCY.
AND WHEN CHRISTIANS WANT TODENY SERVICE, IT'S FREEDOM.
SEE THOSE WHO ARE DEFENDINGTHIS SORT OF LAW, GO VERY
FAR OUT OF THEIR WAY TO SAYHOW IT'S NOT DISCRIMINATORY
TOWARDS ANYBODY, ESPECIALLYGAY PEOPLE.
THEY'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINSTGAY PEOPLE.
AND THEY USE ANALOGIES TOCLARIFY THEIR POSITION.
WHICH ANALOGIES DO, JUST NOTIN THE WAY THEY INTENDED.
>> IF YOU ARE A PRINT SHOPAND YOU ARE A GAY MAN,
SHOULD YOU BE FORCED TOPRINT GOD HATES FAGS FOR THE
WESTBOROUGH BAPTIST CHURCH?
>> IF A KKK MEMBER COMES IN ANDSAYS I WANT A BIRTHDAY CAKE
MADE TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTHOF THE KKK, SHOULD A BAKER
REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OFTHEIR SKIN, BE ABLE TO SAY,
I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE THATCAKE.
>> I WOULD THINK I WOULDGIVE THE SAME RIGHT TO A
JEWISH BAKER TO NOT HAVE TOPUT A SWASTIKA ON A BILL.
>> Jon: IT'S BEEN AWHILESINCE I'VE TAKEN THE SATs.
BUT I BELIEVE THEFORMULATION AS YOU DEFEND
YOURSELVES IS THIS.
THIS COUPLE IS TO CHRISTIANBUSINESS AS THESE FOLKS ARE
TO EVERYONE ELSE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?
I'M NOT DISCRIMINATING, IHAVE NOTHING AGAINST GAY
PEOPLE, I'M JUST SAYING, FORSOME CHRISTIANS, CATERING AN
ELDERLY LESBIAN WEDDING ISLIKE MAKING A JEW SLOW DANCE
WITH HITLER.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
(LAUGHTER)
DO YOU SEE HOW [BLEEP] THAT IS?
BASICALLY YOU SEE PEOPLECELEBRATING LOVE AS A HATE
GROUP.
ALTHOUGH, THERE IS GOODNEWS.
>> IT REMAINS LEGAL IN MOSTOF INDIANA TO FIRE SOMEONE
BECAUSE THEY'RE GAY.
>> Jon: YES!
SO THE LESSON HERE ISCLEAR.
YOU ARE IN INDIANA AND YOUGET FIRED FOR BEING GAY,
MAKE THOSE MOTHER [BLEEP]CATER YOUR WEDDING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
