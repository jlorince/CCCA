[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
NEWARK MAYOR CORY BOOKER WILL BE JOINING US, BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT AS I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT, WITH AN APOLOGY.
WE'VE HAD A BIT OF FUN HERE OVER THE YEARS CONCERNING WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO THIS TIME
OF YEAR AS THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS WHERE A SMALL BAND OF 70% OF THE COUNTRY HAVE FOUGHT TIRELESSLY
FOR THE RIGHT TO OPENLY CELEBRATE THE FEAST DAY OF THEIR LORD'S BIRTH, TO HAVE A MASS ON
THAT DAY HONORING THEIR CHRIST, A MASS CHRIST, IF YOU WILL.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, WE HAVE POKED FUN AT THIS, SAYING SUCH THINGS AS, THERE IS NO WAR ON CHRISTMAS OR YOU'RE
[BLEEPED] CRAZY.
[LAUGHTER]
CLASSIC WIT.
THAT WAS BEFORE I REALIZED WHAT THESE POOR FOLKS HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH.
>> THIS IS THE THING ABOUT ATHEISTS, THEY BULLY OTHER RELIGIONS.
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THEIR HANDS IN MY RELIGION.
>> IT'S ABOUT BEING INTOLERANT TO THE NATURE OF TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY.
THIS ENDS UP BEING ABOUT BULLIES.
>> THEY'RE BEING BULLIES.
WHAT ARE CHRISTIANS SUPPOSED TO DO?
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.
OH, OH, NO, WRONG JESUS, MY FRIEND.
>> THERE IS A PROBLEM IN AMERICA WITH THE CHRISTIAN FORCES BEING WEAK.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M TELLING YOU, BILL, WIMPY PASTORS PRODUCE WIMPY CHRISTIANS.
>> THEY SEE JESUS AS THIS LITTLE WIMPY GUY WHO WALKED AROUND PLUCKING DAISES AND EATING BIRDSEED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: PLUCKING DAISES AND EATING BIRDSEED?
I THINK YOU'RE THINKING OF RUSSELL BRAND.
IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE.
TO THINK OF HIM.
NO, THE TRUTH IS I THINK EVEN MOST NON-CHRISTENS DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE THAT FOR ABOUT
10% OF EVERY YEAR THE PUBLIC SPHERE IS DOMINATED BY THIS ONE PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION
IN THE SAME WAY CHRISTIAN DON'T CARE THAT PEOPLE SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND SEASONS GREETINGS
BECAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW THE RELIGION OF THE PERSON YOU'RE GREETING.
MERRY CHRISTMAS AND THEY SAY BACK TO YOU [INAUDIBLE].
SO YOU DON'T KNOW.
SO WHAT ARE THESE ATHEIST BULLIES WANT?
I'M ASSUMING A DICTATORSHIP OF GODLESSNESS.
>> WE'RE STOPPING THE GOVERNMENT FROM PREFERRING ONE RELIGION OVER ANOTHER.
>> WE DEMAND EQUALITY FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND IT'S OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD BE DEMANDING IT ALONG WITH ME.
>> Jon: YES!
WE SHOULD BECAUSE YOU ARE PERHAPS TECHNICALLY CORRECT, ALTHOUGH I'M STILL NOT SURE HOW
YOUR LOCAL MANGER SCENE
