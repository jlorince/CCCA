>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT: J.J. ABRAMS
IS GOING TO BE JOINING US.
HE'S THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE
NEWEST "STAR TREK" MOVIE COMING
OUT.
SOON HE'LL BE IN CHARGE OF THE
"STAR WARS" MOVIES AND YET FOR
SOME REASON ALL OF MY QUESTIONS:
WHY DID FELICITY CUT HER SNARE
WHY?
(LAUGHTER)
THURSDAY NIGHT I CAUGHT FLAK A
T.V. HUSBAND AND WEEKEND SQUASH
PARTNER BILL O'REILLY.
(LAUGHTER)
I WAS TALKING ABOUT CONGRESS' ON
GOING BENGHAZI FREAKOUT AND I
HAPPENED TO CITE A UNIVERSITY OF

BUT HERE'S WHERE MY FRIEND JUST
GOT MEAN.
