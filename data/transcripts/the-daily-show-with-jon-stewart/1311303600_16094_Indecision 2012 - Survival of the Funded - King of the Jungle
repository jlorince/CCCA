ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE GETTING THERE.
LET'S SEE WHERE GOVERNOR TIM
PAWLENTY IS AT.
HE'S GOT THERE 4.4 MILLION
RAISED.
>> FORMER GOVERNOR TIM PAWLENTY
KICKED OFF THREE WEEKS OF IOWA
BODILY HARM STORMING IN ADVANCE
OF THE STRAW POLL NEXT MONTH
WITH AN R.V. STORM AND A WARNING
THAT IOWANS SHOULD NOT RAISE
THEIR SUPPORT ON CHARISMATIC
CANDIDATES WHO CAN'T ACTUALLY
WIN.
>> Jon: OH, TIM PAWLENTY
TAKING A BOLD STAND AGAINST KRIS
MATT.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S GOT NO PLACE IN POLITICS.
HEY, LOOK, THIS IS NOT A
POPULARITY CONTEST.
OH, IT IS?
OH.
WELL, I WONDER HOW "THE DAILY
SHOW" WILL DEPICT PAWLENTY'S
DEMISE.
[LAUGHTER]
IF A PAWLENTY CAMPAIGN FALLS IN
THE WOODS, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND?
WHO'S NEXT.
>> HERMAN CAIN RAISED $2.5
MILLION.
>> Jon: $2.5 MILLION FOR
HERMAN CAIN.
THAT'S A LOT OF PEPPERONI FOR
THE GODFATHER OF PIZZA.
WHY IS CAIN CONNECTING?
>> I THINK I'M CONNECTING
BECAUSE OF MY PASSION ABOUT MY
SUPPORT AND BELIEF IN THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> Jon: YES.
HERMAN CAIN HAS PASSION.
SUPPORT AND BELIEF IN THE
CONSTITUTION.ñr
BUT DOES HERMAN CAIN HAVE AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THE
CONSTITUTION?
>> YOU SAID THIS WEEK THAT YOU
OPPOSE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW
MOSQUE IN MURFREESBORO,
TENNESSEE.
WHAT'S YOUR OBJECTION TO THEIR
BUILDING A NEW MOSQUE?
>> OUR CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.
ISLAM COMBINES CHURCH AND STATE.
THEY ARE USING THE CHURCH PART
OF OUR FIRM TO INFUSE THEIR
MOSQUE IN THAT COMMUNITY, AND
THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY DO
NOT LIKE IT.
THEY DISAGREE WITH IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
FIRST LET'S ADDRESS...
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT I BELIEVE MAY BE SOME
PRONOUN ISSUES.
[LAUGHTER]
USING "OUR" FIRST AMENDMENT TO
BUILD "" MOSQUE.
IN REALITY, THE FIRST AMENDMENT
PROTECTS "THEIR" MOSQUE FROM
"US."
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING ANY
COMMUNITY, IF THEY WANT TO BAN A
MOSQUE...
>> YES, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO
DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT DISCRIMINATING BASED
UPON RELIGION AGAINST THEIR
PARTICULAR RELIGION.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S
THE DEFINITION OF DISCRIMINATING
BASED UPON RELIGION.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN ILLUSTRATE
THAT BY REPLACING THE WORD
MOSQUE IN THAT SENTENCE IN THE,
YES, THEY CAN BAN THE MOSQUE
SENTENCE, WITH THE WORD CHURCH.
OR SYNAGOGUE OR CHURCH-SYNAGOGUE
OR SCIENTOLOGY CELEBRITY CENTER.
UNLESS YOU'RE SUGGESTING ISLAM
IS OTHER THAN AN RELIGION.
>> ISLAM IS BOTH A RELIGION AND
A SET OF LAWS, SHARIA LAW.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ANY ONE OF OUR OTHER TRADITIONAL
RELIGIONS WHENWHERE IT'S JUST
ABOUT RELIGIOUS PURPOSES.
>> Jon: YES, YES, YES.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
I READ ABOUT THE STRANGENESS OF
THEIR COMBINATION OF RELIGION
AND LAWS IN MY PEOPLE'S HOLY
BOOK, THE TORAH, WHICH
TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH
LITERALLY MEANS "THE LAW."
I DON'T THINK THE PREDATORS ARE
EVEN GOING TO BOTHER WITH THIS
ONE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S ADORABLE.
OF COURSE, THERE'S ONE CANDIDATE
WHO SEEMS TO BE GAINING STRENGTH
BY THE DAY, MICHELE BACHMANN,
BUT CAN HER $4.2 MILLION
FUND-RAISING HELP FED OFF
QUESTIONS ABOUT HERRELLTIVE LACK
OF EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE, AND
THIS THING.
>> FORMER AIDES SAY THE
CONGRESSWOMAN IS PRONE TO
"DEBILITATING MIGRAINES."
>> WILL MICHELE BACHMANN'S
MIGRAINES HURT HER BID?
>> SHOULD THIS BE CONSIDERED A
CAMPAIGN ISSUE?
>> Jon:, GOT TO SAY, OF ALL MY
ISSUES WITH MICHELE BACHMANN'S
BRAIN...
[LAUGHTER]
MIGRAINE'S NOT EVEN TOP 20.
BUT WHO ARE WE KIDDING?
WE KNOW WHO THE CLEAR
FRONT-RUNNER IS.
$18 MILLION RAISED, MITT ROMNEY
IS THE KING OF THE JUNGLE.
HE'S THE SUPER PREDATOR OF THE
RACE.
HE'S THE REPUBLICAN'S LEADER.
BACK-UP WEEKEND GRETCHEN THINKS
THERE MAY BE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ROMNEY.
>> I THINK HE COULD GET A LOT OF
MONEY FROM THAT.
>> BIG TIME.
>> ROMNEY OBVIOUSLY NOT BEING A
CHRISTIAN.
>> Jon: WHAT?
SOMEONE GET THAT WOMAN TO BOOK A
MORMON.
REALLY, ? CAN'T GET IN UNTIL
FEBRUARY 2014?
WOW, THAT THING IS DOING WELL.
WELL, I'M SURE BACK-UP WEEKEND
GRETCHEN'S PRODUCERS WILL POINT
OUT THE FALLACY OF HER REASONING
DURING THE NEXT COMMERCIAL
BREAK.
>> DURING THE 6:00 A.M. I
MENTIONED THAT MITT ROMNEY WAS
NOT A CHRISTIAN.
HE IS A MEMBER OF THE JESUS
CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS
CHURCH, AND THAT CHURCH DOES
CONSIDER ITS MEMBERS CHRISTIANS.
>> Jon: OH, AND ONE OTHER
THING, TIME FOR LUTHERANS TO
[BLEEPED] OR GET OFF THE POT.
REFORMATION IS OVER.
YOU
