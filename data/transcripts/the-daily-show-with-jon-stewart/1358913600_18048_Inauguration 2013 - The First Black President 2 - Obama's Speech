>> Jon: NAILED IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS ALL PART AND PARCEL OF THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'SEL
SECOND INAUGURATION.
-- OBAMA'S SECOND INAUGURATION.
YESTERDAY'S EVENTS HAD EVERYTHING A NEW INAUG-OFILE WOULD LOVE.
THE LARGE CROWDS, THE SWEARING IN, THE WALKING, THE WAVING, A FAIRYTALE STYLE BALL AND THE
GRANDEST OF AMERICAN TRADITIONS THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER.
TODAY'S CELEBRATED BARACK OBAMA BREAKOUT STAR WAS NONE OTHER THAT CHARLES SCHUMER WHO HOSTED
THE FEST ACTIVITIES.
HE WAS ABLE TO ENHANCE THE RIT YIMENT WITH SHAH BAT SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS.
>> THE THEME OF THIS YEAR'S INAUGURAL IS FAITH IN AMERICA'S FUTURE.
>> Jon: SPEAKING OF FAITH, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD AT THIS TIME THANK CANTOR LONESTEIN'S LOVELY
WIFE, HANNAH, FOR THE DELICIOUS TREATS AWAITING US DOWNSTAIRS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOLLOWING THE SER --
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT OF COURSE INAUGURATION DAY ISN'T ALL CEREMONY.
AT ITS CENTER IS THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH WHERE HE ARTICULATES THE VISION OF GOVERNANCE IN THE NEXT
FOUR YEARS.
THE EARLY REVIEWS.
>> MARVELOUS SPEECH BRAVE AND BOLD.
>> HISTORIC SPEECH.
>> AUDACIOUS SPEECH.
>> A HUGE PROPOSAL FOR AMERICA.
>> Jon: IT'S A CALL TO ACTION LIKE J.F.K.'S ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY TO K- DO FOR YOU OR FDR,
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF OR JIMMY CARTER'S SOMEWHAT INEXPLICABLE "SHE'S A
BRICKHOUSE SHE'S MIGHTY MIGHTY."
[ LAUGHTER ]
TRUE IT WAS AN INAUGURAL SPEECH BEFORE YOU IT WAS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S LISTEN TO BARACK OBAMA.
>> FIDEL AT THIS TO OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES NEW RESPONSES TO NEW CHALLENGES.
NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST DO THESE THINGS TOGETHER.
AS ONE NATION AND ONE PEOPLE.
>> Jon: YES, BARACK OBAMA, RELIEF FROM THE BURDEN OF SEEKING ELECTIONS DARES TO
SUGGEST PUBLICLY THAT A GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE AND OF THE PEOPLE
COULD BE AT TIMES HELPFUL TO THOSE PEOPLE.
RADICAL MOTHER (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN HE THREW DOWN THE MIC I'M OUT, BITCH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BEFORE I GO OF MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT HAVE WE DONE TOGETHER.
>> WE LEARNED THAT NO UNION SURVIVED ON LIBERTY AND EQUALITY COULD SURVIVE HALF TRUTHS.
>> Jon: TOGETHER WE ENDED SLAVERY.
>> WE RESOLVED THAT A GREAT NATION MUST CARE FOR THE VULNERABLE.
>> Jon: TOGETHER WE GAVE DIGNITY TO OUR ELDERLY AND OUR POOR.
>> WE DETERMINED THAT A MD YEARN ECONOMY REQUIRES RAILROADS AND HIGHWAYS.
>> Jon: TOGETHER WE BUILT THE JERSEY TURNPIKE.
I LOOKED IT'S NOT THE SAME LEVEL, THEN THEY CREATED THE EX-PASS.
NOT EVERYBODY GOT ONE.
IF YOU ARE GOING FROM SEE CAUCUS TO BORDENTOWN, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
TAKE THE GARDEN STATE?
IT'S ABSURD.
IT'S BIG IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
WE ENDED SLAVERY AND BUILT ROADING TO.
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO NEXT?
>> WE WILL RESPOND TO THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
SOME MAY DENY THE OVERWHELMINGLY JUDGMENT OF SCIENCE BUT NONE CAN AVOID THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF
THE FIRES, CRIPPLING DROUGHT AND MORE POWERFUL STORMS.
>> Jon: OH (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT WE NEED THE LAST AIR VENDOR.
BUT PERHAPS THE LINE THAT GOT THE MOST ATTENTION IN OBAMA'S SPEECH WAS THIS ONE.
>> WE, THE PEOPLE, DECLARED TODAY THAT -- DECLARE TODAY THAT THE MOST EVIDENT OF TRUTHS THAT
ALL OF RUSS CREATED EQUAL IS THE STAR THAT GUIDES US STILL.
JUST AS IT GUIDED OUR FORBEARERS THROUGH SENECA FALLS AND THE SELMA AND STONEWALL.
>> Jon: I BELIEVE IT'S THE FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT HAS NAME CHECKED A GAY BAR AT HIS INAUGURATION.
OTHER THAN RUTHER FORD B. HAYES TALKING ABOUT WORK TEG LOADED MUSKET.
PUT SOME PANTS ON
