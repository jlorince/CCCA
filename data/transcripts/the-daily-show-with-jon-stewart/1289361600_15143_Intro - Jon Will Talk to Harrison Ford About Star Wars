>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JIEWRTD.
WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
BY THE WAY, I JUST WANT TO LET
YOU KNOW AT HOME, IF YOU RECEIVE
EVER A NOTIFICATION FROM OUR
STAFF THAT YOU HAVE TICKETS TO
THE PROGRAM, THAT'S NOT THE SAME
AS SCHEDULING AN INTERVIEW.
( LAUGHTER )
WE HAD A LOVELY GIRL IN THE
AUDIENCE, FIRST QUESTION.
YES, HELLO, FOUR YEARS AT
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.
WE GOT A NICE SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHO IS ON THE SHOW
TONIGHT?
HARRISON FORD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT WAS A JOBA THE HUT
REFERENCE I THREW IN THERE.
I'M SURE HE'S DYING TO TALK
ABOUT THAT.
( LAUGHTER )
LITTLE DOES HE KNOW HE'S ABOUT
TO SIT DOWN WITH A GUY WHO SPENT
HIS WEEKEND CLEANING HIS LIFE
SIZED AND FULLY OPERATIONAL BBCA
FETE COSTUME.
PERHAPS HARRISON CAN ESCAPE
