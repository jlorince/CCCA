WHY DO YOU AND HILLARY WANT ANYPART OF THIS DYSFUNCTIONAL,
HORRIBLE, WHEN ALL THE IDEASYOU HAVE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED
IN A DIFFERENT SECTOR.
YOU GUYS HAVE A SUCCESSFULBUSINESS.
YOU CAN PRINT MONEY, YOU CANMAKE SPEECHES, YOU CAN HELP
PEOPLE, WHY DO YOU WANT ANYPART OF US?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND?
WHY NOT JUST-- DON'T YOUHAVE DOGS.
CAN'T YOU JUST GO OUT ANDPLAY WITH THE DOGS AND GO DO
A SPEECH AND YOU DON'T HAVEPEOPLE POKING AROUND LIKE OH,
THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI, WHAT DIDHE GET FOR THAT MONEY?
THAT KIND OF THING. WHY DO YOUEVEN WANT THIS?
WHY DO YOU STILL LIKE US?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I'MALONG FOR THE RIDE.
SHE IS THE ONE WHO IS RUNNING.
BUT LOOK--
>> Jon: SO ARE YOU GOING TOHAVE TO PICK A FIRST MAN
ISSUE.
LIKE-- WILL YOU GO TO THEOFFICE LIKE--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HERE'S WHAT THEY DO WITH FIRSTLADIES.
DOESN'T MATTER  HOWACCOMPLISHED, DOESN'T MATTER HER
LEVEL OF EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE, THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE
SO, WHERE IS YOUR GARDEN.
LIKE THAT.
THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO DIMINISHTHE FIRST LADY.
THEY NEVER WANT HER TO BE APART.
THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU.
>> WELL, I'VE HAD A PRETTYGOOD RUN.
I CAN HANDLE IT.
BUT LOOK, MICHELLE OBAMA HASDONE A LOT OF GOOD.
>> Jon: A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OFGOOD.
LOOK HOW MUCH GUFF SHETAKES.
>> THAT GARDEN SET A GOODEXAMPLE, BUT SHE STARTED THE
LET'S MOVE PROGRAM AND FOR AHEALTHIER GENERATION, WE
STARTED TRYING TO IMPROVEHEALTH, TACKLE CHILDHOOD
OBESITY IN THE SCHOOLS ANDGOT A LITTLE REPUTATION
BECAUSE WE GOT THE SOFTDRINK COMPANIES TO AGREE, AN
AGREEMENT ALONG WITH MAJORJUICE PRODUCERS AND EVEN PEOPLE
WHO PUT MILK IN SCHOOLS, WEREREDUCED BY 90% THE CALORIES
GOING INTO SCHOOLS IN DRINKS.
IN VENDING MACHIENS AND IN THE CAFETERIA.
SO WE SAID WILL YOU HELP USWITH THE EXERCISE PROGRAM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND KEEP WORK ON THEMEALS AND ALL THAT.
SO THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSONFOUNDATION GAVE US SOME
MONEY AND NOW WE'RE WORKINGALMOST 28,000 SCHOOLS, MORE
THAN 17 MILLION PEOPLE ANDWE JUST GOT OUR FIRST STUDY
FROM THE CENTER FOR DISEASECONTROL SAYING SCHOOLS
PARTICIPATINGING ARE DRIVINGDOWN OBESITY IN THE REDUCING
THE NUMBER OF OVERWEIGHTKIDS.
I DO THIS, SO YOU CAN DO IT.
THE REASON, THE SHORT REASONFOR WHY SHE'S DOING THIS IS
GOVERNMENT STILL MATTERS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I WROTE ABOOK IN 2011 CALLED BACK TO
WORK.
WHEN I THOUGHT IT HADNOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY,
SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WASABOUT TO RUN FOR
RE-ELECTION.
AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHYTHE BEST, MOST SUCCESSFUL
COUNTRIES HAVE A VIGOROUSPRIVATE SECTOR, AN EFFECTIVE
GOVERNMENT AND PRACTICESHARED PROSPERITY.
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHAREDPROSPERITY, AND TWO-THIRDS OR
MORE OF YOUR ECONOMY DEPENDS ONCONSUMER SPENDING, YOU ARE
TOAST.
I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST-- FORGETABOUT HOW HORRIBLE IT IS
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTEDAND WORKED FOR 15 YEARS AND
NEVER GET A PAY RAISE. IT WON'TWORK.
YOU HAVE GOT TO FIND A WAYTO DO THAT.
THAT'S THE THING I'MPROUDEST OF, IS THE ONLY
TIME IN 50 YEARS WHENALL QUINTILES MOVED TOGETHER.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TO WORRYABOUT AVOIDING DEPRESSION,
GETTING OUT OF THERECESSION.
WE JUST GAINED BACK ALL THEJOBS WE LOST.
SO MOST OF THE WORK OFBUILDING SHARE PROSPERITY IS
OUT THERE IN THE FUTURE.
AND SOME OF IT CAN BE DONEVOLUNTARILY, LIKE I SAID.
THE GUY THAT UNARES THEBIGGEST FUND IN THE WORLD
ACTUALLY SAID YOU WOULDTHINK ALL THE INVESTORS LOVE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE ALL CAPITALGAINS, HE SAID I THINK IT OUGHT
TO BE LINKED IN FOR FREE SOPEOPLE WILL GO BACK INTO
INVESTING, AND NOT JUST TRADING.
MY GRANDFATHER USED TO TELLME THAT PEOPLE WERE SO POOR
IN THE DEPRESSION THATTHEY TOOK IN ONE ANOTHER'S
LAUNDRY FOR A LIVING.
>> Jon: JUST PASS THAT ONEDOLLAR BACK AND FORTH.
>> THAT CAN HAPPEN AT THETOP HALF AT THE FIRST
PERCENT, TAKING ONE ANOTHER'SMONEY FOR A LIVING IF IT IS ALL
SPINNING AROUND IN TRADE, YOUWANT TO INVESTED.
AMERICANS DO NOT RESENTPEOPLE BEING SUCCESSFUL,
MAKING MONEY.
WHAT THEY WANT IS A FAIRDEAL.
AND WHAT THEY NEED FOR AFAIR DEAL IS A MUCH LIAR
LEVEL OF INVESTMENT.
AND YOU KNOW, WE WERE KINDOF RAGGING ABOUT THE
BROADBAND IN RURAL AREAS,THAT IS A BIG DEAL.
SOUTH KOREA'S AVERAGEBROADBAND SPEEDS ARE FOUR TIMES
HIGHER.
>> Jon: THE BROADBAND INTHIS COUNTRY ARE
EMBARRASSING.
>> THEIR ACCESSES ARE CHEAPER.WHY?
BECAUSE IN SOUTH KOREA, THEGOVERNMENT BUILT THE NETWORK AND
THEN PRIVATIZED PARTICIPATION.
HERE WE LEFT IT UP TO BIGCOMPANIES.
>> Jon: IT'S WAHT WE DID WITHUTILITIES.
>> WE LEAVE IT UP TO BIGCOUNTRIES LIKE VERIZON AND
AT&T TO BUILD A NETWORK, ANDTHEN HAD A BIG FIGHT OVER
NET NEUTRALITY.
I'M FOR NET NEUTRALITY.
I LOVE WHAT THEY ARE DOINGIN SILICON VALLEY.
IT'S GREAT, BUT AT&T ANDVERIZON ARE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW THEY CAN RECOVERTHEIR INVESTMENT IN THE
INFRASTRUCTURE.
MEANWHILE, IT'S NOT VERYECONOMICAL TO DO SOME PLACES.
NOW LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE.
IN KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE, THEWHOLE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND
THE LABOR COMMUNITY GOTTOGETHER AND BUILT A VERY
UP-TO-DATE, SUPER-FAST BROADBANDNETWORK.
AND IT TRANSFORMED THEECONOMY.
THEY MADE IT INTO A HEALTHCAREAND TECH CENTER, CREATED
ZILLIONS OF JOBS BECAUSESOMEBODY FIGURED OUT HOW TO
MAKE THE INVESTMENT.
IT'S WHAT GOOGLE DID IN KANSASACITY, IN NOW THEY SAID THEY WILL
DO IT IN 45 OTHER CITIES.
BUT WE NEED TO DO THATEVERYWHERE.
AND I'M TELLING YOU, THEREARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN RURAL
PARTS OF AMERICA THAT MAKE APERFECTLY GOOD LIVING IF
THEY COULD OPERATE MOREON-LINE AND THEY CAN'T DO IT
IN THE HORSE AND BUGGY AREAWHEN SOMEBODY IN SOUTH KOREA
CAN DO IT FASTER AND CHEAPER.
IT'S CRAZY FOR US TO LETTHIS BE DONE FASTER AND
CHEAPER.
THE INTERNET STARTED INAMERICA, FOR GOODNESS SAKES.
>> Jon: NO, AND IT'S ALLOBVIOUS.
BUT THE FEAR IS THATWE WILL NEVER RESPOND UNTIL
THE IMPLOSION ANDCATASTROPHE IS UPON US
BECAUSE THAT IS OUR MO.
OUR MO IS WE KNOW EXACTLYWHAT TO DO.
WE SEE THE TRAIN COMING ANDWE KEEP LOOKING AT IT GOING,
"THAT LOOKS PRETTY CLOSE, THATLOOKS PRETTY CLOSE."
AND THEN ONCE IT HAS RUN OVERUS, WE GO "YEAH, WE PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHINGABOUT THAT." THAT'S OUR
PROBLEM.
>> WELL, AS CHURCH HILL ONCESAID, HOW DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY OF THIS?
ANY OF THIS.
(APPLAUSE)
>> IN WORLD WAR II BEFOREAMERICA GOT IN, IT WAS
PRETTY BLEAK FOR BRITAIN.
AND THE PRESS TRIED TO ADDSOME LEVITY TO ONE OF HIS
PRESS CONFERENCES.
BY SAYING YOU ARE SUCH A BIGFAN OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT,
YOU SAY HE'S GREAT.
BUT WHERE ARE THEY? WE'RE OVERHERE GETTING OUR HEADS HANDED
TO US.
AND CHURCH HILL SAID THEAMERICAN PEOPLE, HE SAID THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICAALWAYS DOES THE RIGHT THING,
AFTER EXHAUSTING EVERY OTHERALTERNATIVE.
>> Jon: THERE WE GO.
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON
