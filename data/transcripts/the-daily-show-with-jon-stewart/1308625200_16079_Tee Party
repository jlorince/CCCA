(LAUGHTER) SO WERE ECONOMIC ISSUES DISCUSSED AT ALL THIS WEEKEND?
OF COURSE THEY WERE AND LUCKY FOR US OUR TROUBLED JOB MARKET AND DEFICIT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE MOST
STRIKINGLY COMIC WAY POSSIBLE ON THE GOLF COURSE.
WHERE BARACK OBAMA, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER
AND FOR SOME REASON OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH TOOK TO THE LINKS TO DISCUSS WHAT
SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE POOR.
LOOK AT THEM.
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.
IF YOU WERE DESIGNING AN EDITORIAL CARTOON ABOUT OUT OF TOUCH WASHINGTON INSIDERS
DISCUSSING A FAILING ECONOMY,
YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON A GOLF COURSE AND THEN CROSS IT OUT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO CLICHED.
TOO ON THE NOSE.
YOU WOULD SAY TO YOURSELF IT'S LIKE THEY'RE POSING FOR
THEIR OWN "NEW YORK POST" PAGE 6 CARTOON.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE "THE NEW YORK POST" WOULD NOT MAKE A CARTOON OF BARACK OBAMA
HAVING SEX WITH JOHN BOEHNER WHILE POINTING TO A SHEEP.
WE ACTUALLY MADE THAT CARTOON.
BUT DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU POLITICAL HUMOR IS A GUYING ART.
POOR OPTIC AS SIDE, WHY WOULD JOHN BOEHNER AGREE TO GO GOLFING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
>> THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM TO PLAY GOLF, IT'S THE PRESIDENT.
YOU DON'T SAY NO TO THE PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT?
DO YOU FOLLOW POLITICS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE PRESIDENT IN PRIVATE DIRECTLY ASKED THE SPEAKER FOR WHAT THEY CALL A CLEAN VOTE.
SPEAKER BOEHNER SAID NO WAY.
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO BRING REPRESENTATIVES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
BOEHNER SAID NO.
>> JOHN BOEHNER SAYING NO TO THE STATE DINNER INVITATION.
>> SPEAKER BOEHNER TURNS DOWN ANOTHER INVEIGH TRACE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Jon: OH, I GUESS YOU DIDN'T SAY NO TO THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE ARE YOU OUT OF NOs.
YOUR NO CUP IS NOW EMPTY FOR ALL THE NOING YOU SAY,
ALWAYS.
BUT WHO KNOWS, MAYBE NEXT ROUND OF GOLF IS ALL IT TAKES TO BREAK THE TENSION
BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS.
WE ALL KNOW HOW RELAXING GOLF CAN BE.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE ODD YOF THEIR GAME.
>> JOHN, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THERE'S A COMPROMISE TO BE-- [BLEEP].
>> WELL, I THINK WE COULD FIND AN AGREEMENT ON THE PROVISION [BLEEP].
>> Jon: WE COULD HAVE A RES LUIG OF THE-- BUT A DUCK SHOT AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO
