BY NOW WE ALL KNOW THE AMERICANGOVERNMENT IS SPYING ON US.
THEY'RE IN OUR PHONES, OURE-MAILS, OUR TUMBLRS, THE
GRINDERS, THE TWITTERS, THEWHITAKERS -- THAT'S AN APP THAT
TELLS YOU WHERE FOREST WHITAKERIS AT ALL TIMES.
YOU'RE NOT SAFE ANYMOREANYWHERE, OR TO PARAPHRASE A
CERTAIN SAGE PHILOSOPHER...
♪ I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'SWATCHING ME ♪♪
THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEWSEGMENT, "SOMEBODY IS WATCHING
ME."
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRYABOUT "BIG BROTHER" ANYMORE, BIG
EMPLOYER IS GETTING IN ONTHE GAME.
>> THE NEW SPYING SCANDAL THISMORNING, THOUGH, NOT SOME
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.
NO, AT IKEA.
THE FURNITURE COMPANY STANDSACCUSED OF SPYING ON EMPLOYEES
AND CUSTOMERS IN FRANCE.
>> Jon: FRANCE!
NOT JUST IKEA, FRENCH IKEA, APLACE THAT COMBINES THE CHAOS
AND FRUSTRATION OF IKEA ANDCOMBINES IT WITH FRANCE.
[LAUGHTER]SO HERE'S THE DEAL: THERE'S NO
WAY IKEA HAS BEEN SPYING ONTHEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IF THEY
DID, THEY WOULD KNOW THAT IKEAHAS A TERRIBLE FELINE
INFESTATION.
[LAUGHTER]I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S JUST AN AD
FOR THEIR NEW LINE OF CAT URINESCENTED FURNITURE.
SO WHAT ARE THESELINGONBERRY SLINGERS TRYING TO
FIND OUT?
>> IKEA MAY HAVE USEDINFORMATION TO QUELL WORKPLACE
GRIEVANCES.
>>>> Jon: THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE
OF THE MOST HUMILIATING PLACESTO BE FIRED FROM.
MONSIEUR BERNARD, I KNOW YOU'VEBEEN STEALING FLA�RDFULLS, SO
PACK UP YOUR THINGS AND GET OFFTHE DAGSTORP AND DON'T LET THE
BILLY-OLSBO HIT YOU ON THE WAYOUT, ANY OF THE FINE BILLY
PRODUCTS.
WE LOOKED AT THE THING AND THEDOORS ARE CALLED BILLIES.
IT'S FUNNY THAT THIS WAS GOINGON AT IKEA OF ALL PLACES BECAUSE
THEY ACTUALLY SELL AN ITEM THATSHIELDS YOU FROM BEING SPIED ON.
IT'S CALLED THE INGEN SPY.
