HE HAS A NEW SHOW ON A NETWORKCALLED MSNBC, LOOK IT UP IN YOUR
CABLE GUIDE IT'S CALLED RONANFARROW DAILY.

MINUTES.
[LAUGHTER]BUT IF I MAY:  I BELIEVE IT WAS
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR WHO SAIDTHE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS
LONG BUT IT BENDS TOWARDSJUSTICE.
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]HOWEVER, IT APPEARS SOME OF
AMERICA'S STATE LEGISLATURESWOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT ARCLONGER AND
MAYBE HAVE IT BEND NOT AS MUCHTOWARDS JUSTICE BUT BACKWARDS
AND UP THEIR OWN ASSES. AS WE'LLSEE IN OUR NEXT SEGMENT, THESTATES: METH LABS OF DEMOCRACY.
LIKE KANSAS THE WHEAT STATE.
THE PLACE YOU ARE DESPERATELYTRYING TO GET BACK TO FROM OZ,
OL BOXY.
WHERE STATE LAWMAKERS ASKINGTHEIR PARENTS IS THAT ALL YOUGOT?
[LAUGHTER]PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT.
>> ONE KANSAS LAWMAKER WANTS TOALLOW PARENTS TO HIT THEIR KIDS
HARDER.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YEAH.

GUARDIAN'S WRITTEN PERMISSION TOHIT A CHILD HARDER.

[LAUGHTER]A QUICK SHOT TO THE CHOPS WOULD
DO IT.
WHAT IS THIS LAW SPECIFICALLYMEAN BY HARDER.
AND COULD YOU FORM YOURANSWER THE WAY PERHAPS A SERIAL
KILLER MIGHT?

PUNISHMENT MEANS UP TO 10FORCEFUL APPLICATIONS IN
SUCCESSION OF A BARE OPENHANDED PALM AGAINST THE CLOSED
BUTTOCKS OF A CHILDACKNOWLEDGING THATBRUISING OR REDNESS MIGHT OCCUR
ON THE TENDER SKIN OF A CHILD ASA RESULT.
>> Jon: YEA AS THE ROSIEHANDPRINT BLOSSOMS ON THE YOUNG
CHILD'S BUTTOCKS LIKE A BLUSHINGFLOWER AGAINST A FIELD OF VIRGIN
SNOW ONLY THEN WILL A LESSON BEBRANDED ON YOUR ONCE DEFIANT
WARD.
-- YOUR HONOR.
WHY SHOULDN'T WE HIT OURCHILDREN HARD ENOUGH TO BRUISE
THEM?
>> THEY HAVE RESEARCH THAT HASSHOWN IT IS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN

IT TENDS TO LEAD TO MOREAGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS WITH A
CHILD.

EFFECTIVE.

[ LAUGHTER ]BY THE WAY MIKA BRAZINSKI'S
