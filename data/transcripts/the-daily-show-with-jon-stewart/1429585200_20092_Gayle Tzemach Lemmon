AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGNRELATIONS, ALSO A BEST-SELLING
AUTHOR. HER NEW BOOK ISCALLED "ASHLEY'S WAR:
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A TEAMOF WOMEN SOLDIERS ON THE
SPECIAL OPS BATTLEFIELD."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON.
HELLO.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: IT'S A TREMENDOUS STORY.
THE BOOK IS CALLED"ASHLEY'S WAR."
THIS BOOK COMES OUT, YOUKNOW, WE'RE HAVING A DEBATE
IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT THE ROLEOF WOMEN IN COMBAT.
AND THIS BOOK IF I MAYPARAPHRASE IT, PEOPLE ARE
WONDERING CAN WOMEN HAVE AROLE IN COMBAT AND THIS BOOK
WOULD SUGGEST OH, THEY'VEALREADY BEEN DOING IT FOR
YEARS.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND DOING IT WITHGREAT VALOR.
>> THAT'S THE THING.
I MEAN, THIS IS A VALOR STORY.
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW,POLITICS OR POLICY, IT'S ABOUT
PURPOSE.
AND THAT IS WHY, YOU KNOW,WHEN THE CALL WENT OUT FROM
SOME OF THE MOST SEASONEDLEADERS OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS,
WE NEED WOMEN ON THEBATTLEFIELD 2011 IN
AFGHANISTAN TO HELP RANGERS, ONEOF THE MOST VAUNTED STORIED
MEN OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS,GET OUT THERE AND TALK TO
HALF THE POPULATION THAT WECAN'T ACCESS WHICH IS AFGHAN
WOMEN.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THESE WOMEN RAISETHEIR HANDS.
AND IT IS A STORY OF WHATTHEY HAVE ALREADY DONE.
>> Jon: AND THEY REFER TO THEM IGUESS AS CULTURAL SUPPORT SO
THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOCALL THEM, YOU KNOW, FRONT
THEATER COMBAT TROOPS, WHICHIS WHAT THEY WERE.
>> WELL, THEY CERTAINLY WEREIN COMBAT, RIGHT?
THEY WERE NOT DOING THE SAMEWORK AS RANGERS, RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THEY WERE DEFINITELYALONGSIDE OF THEM, GETTING
ON THE BIRD, YOU KNOW, GOING ONMISSIONS --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WAITING FOR THE RANGERS TO DOTHEIR WORK, AND THEN BEING
CALLED UP. >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO HELP BE SORTOF THE SOFTER SIDE OF THE
HARDEST SIDE OF WAR.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> AND THEY WERE OUT THEREEVERY SINGLE NIGHT
PROVING THEIR METTLE.
AND THE THING IS FOR THEM, ITWAS SUCH A HUGE PRIVILEGE TO
BE OUT THERE WITH THESEGUYS.
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGSTHAT CAME OUT --
>> Jon: THERE WAS A LARGEGROUP THAT THEY HAD TO CHOOSE
FROM THEY REALLY WHITTLED ITDOWN TO THE BEST OF THE
BEST.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. THE FINEST, THEFITTEST, THE MOST FIERCE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND ALSO THE MOST
FEMININE BECAUSE THEY ALSOHAD TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF
THEIR HELMETS IN THE MIDDLE OF ANIGHT TIME MISSION AND SAY,
I'M A FEMALE.
I'M HERE TO KEEP YOU AWAYFROM EVERYTHING ELSE AND TO
REALLY BUILD RAPPORT IN AVERY DIFFICULT MOMENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GETINFORMATION THAT THE RANGERS
WERE UNABLE TO GET BECAUSEOF THE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN
TERMS OF KEEPING THEM AWAYFROM WOMEN AND
THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND THEIRWAY TO INFORMATION IN A VERY
DIFFERENT KIND OF MANNER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I MEAN, SOMETIMES WOMEN WOULDSAY LOOK, YOU KNOW, THE GUY YOU
ARE LOOKING FOR IS TWO HOUSESOVER.
RIGHT AND WHERE THE WOMEN WOULDJUST TALK TO THEM AND TELL THEM
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THEIRCOMMUNITIES BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST LIKE IN THE UNITEDSTATES, IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING INA HOUSEHOLD, TALK TO THE
WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD,RIGHT?
>> Jon: WAIT, IS THAT TRUE?
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME ANDTALK TO MY FAMILY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
ASHLEY HER STORY ISUNFORTUNATELY, SHE PASSES.
SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT.>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: HOW DOES THAT IMPACT THERANGERS?
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THATTHEY TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF
WOMEN ON THE FRONT LINES IS HOWBADLY IT WILL MESS WITH THE
TEAM'S HEAD BUT I IMAGINETHE TEAM, YOU KNOW, HAS TO FACE
THIS TYPE OF DEATH MALE TOFEMALE ALL THE TIME.
>> IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATEREALITY THAT LOSS IS VERY
MUCH A PART OF THEIRBUSINESS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY TRY TO MINIMIZE IT.
THEY HAVE DONE A INCREDIBLEJOB OF MINIMIZING IT BUT
STILL IT IS A LIFE-AND-DEATHHIGH STAKES BUSINESS THAT
THEY ARE IN WHICH IS DOINGAMERICA'S WORK NIGHT IN AND
NIGHT OUT -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO YES IT IS VERYMUCH TRUE THAT THE RANGERS
FELT THE LOSS AND THAT THIS SORTOF ALL-STAR TEAM OF SOME OF THE
MOST FIT AND ALSO TOUGHESTWOMEN
WHO REALLY CONSIDERED ITA HUGE PRIVILEGE TO BE OUT
THERE EVERY SINGLE NIGHTWITH THE BEST OF THE BEST.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NOQUESTION THAT THE LOSS MAY
HAVE BEEN EVEN CLOSER AND THEYHAVE BEEN EVEN MORE COMMITTED
TO DOING THEIR MISSION NIGHT INAND NIGHT OUT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WOULD YOU SAYTHAT THE WOMEN ON THE TEAM,
THE RANGERS ON THE TEAM VIEWEDTHIS AS A KIND OF TEAMING
THAT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUSIN THE FUTURE?
DO YOU THINK THE MAJORITY OFTHEM WOULD GO BACK AND SAY
MAN, THIS IS SOMETHING THATIN SITUATIONS THAT CALL FOR
IT, IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING.
I TALKED TO ONE RANGER WHEN THEYFIRST SAID YOU HAVE TO TRAIN
GIRLS, HE WAS LIKE, OH GOD, YOUKNOW.
AND THEN HE ENDED UP BECOMINGPROBABLY THE STRONGEST
BACKER -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OF ALL OF THESE SOLDIERSBECAUSE HE'D SAY, YOU KNOW,
THESE ARE OUR MONEYMAKERS. THESEGIRLS WANT TO GO OUT THERE.
THEY WANT TO BE OUT THERE.
THESE WOMEN ARE SO COMMITTED,TO DOING THEIR JOB AND DOING
THEIR JOB WELL, RIGHT.
AND THE RANGERS THEMSELVESARE A NIMBLE AND ADAPTIVE
FORCE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO WHEN YOU HAVE FEMALESOLDIERS WHO ARE, YOU KNOW,
HUNGRY TO BE THERE, READY TOADAPT, WANTED TO PROVE
THEMSELVES AND WHO COULDCLEARLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE,
RIGHT?>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> COULD FIND WEAPONS, COULDFIND OUT INFORMATION, COULD END
THE MISSION FASTER, THEN THEYREALLY DID, YOU KNOW,
BRING THEM INTO THE FOLD.
AND I THINK THAT IS WHY ITIS SUCH A STORY THAT WE'VE
BEEN MISSING ABOUT WHAT HASALREADY BEEN HAPPENING.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IS THERE ATHOUGHT TO UTILIZING THE WOMEN
AND CREATING HAVING THEM JOINTHE RANGERS, OR HAVING THEM
CREATE A RANGERS LIKE TROOP?
>> RIGHT. THAT IS A CONVERSATIONTHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN
WASHINGTON.
RIGHT, SO BY JANUARY 1st, 2016,ALL JOBS HAVE TO OPEN UP TO
WOMEN OR A REASON GIVEN ASTO WHY THEY WILL NOT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YOU KNOW, IT'SINTERESTING, IN JUNE OF 2013,
ONE OF THE SPECIAL OPERATIONSCOMMANDERS WAS TALKING
ABOUT ASHLEY AND HER TEAM MATESAND THE WOMEN THAT FOLLOWED --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SAID IT SHOWSWOMEN MAY WELL HAVE LAID THE
FOUNDATION FOR ULTIMATEINTEGRATION, THAT THEY DID A
FABULOUS JOB OUT THERE, THATTHEY REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: RIGHT, YEAH, I HAVE TOSAY, I MEAN, IT IS VERY MOVING.
IT'S HARD TO, AS YOU GET TOKNOW THEM, AND THEN KNOWING
HOW IT ENDS. TOUGH READ.
BUT AS ARE ANY WAR BOOKS,MALE, FEMALE, IT'S ALWAYS
DIFFICULT TO SEE HUMANCAPITAL LIKE THIS HAVE TO
SUFFER THAT PRICE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I THINK WHAT WAS SOINCREDIBLE ABOUT MEETING SO
MANY OF THESE SOLDIERS, MENAND WOMEN, IS THAT THESE
WOMEN WERE SORT OF THISALL-STAR TEAM, RIGHT.
ONE WAS A BRONZE STAR MEDAL OFVALOR WINNER.
ONE WAS ON HER FOURTHDEPLOYMENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ONE HAD HELPED THE FBIBUST DRUG GANGS, RIGHT.
AND ALL OF THEM WOULD SAY THATTHIS WAS THE BEST MISSION
THEY HAD EVER DONE IN THEIRLIFE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE THEY GOT A CHANCE TODO SOMETHING THAT MATTERED AT
THE HEART OF AMERICA'SLONGEST EVER WAR WITH PEOPLE
WHO REALLY GAVE THEM A SHOTIN THE BEST OF THE BEST.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S -- IT'S GREAT.
