[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH
THE CRACKS LEWIS BLACK CATCHES
ITS FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL:  BACK
IN BLACK.
♪ ♪
>> PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS UPSET ABOUT
THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR
LIVES.
SOME BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT IS
OVERPROTECTING US BY KEEPING US
TOO SAFE, SOUND AND COMPLETELY
MISERABLE.
[LAUGHTER]
SOME BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS
UNDERPROTECTING US BY GIVING US
THE FREEDOM TO KILL OURSELVES IN
THE FUNNIEST WAYS IMAGINABLE.
DON'T YOU WORRY, THE HATS WERE
FINE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO WHERE DOES THE NANNY STATE
DRAW THE LINE?
SAY YOU ARE INDULGING IN
AMERICA'S FAVORITE OUTDOOR PAST
TIME, SMOKING, FOR THE 12
MILLIONTH TIME THE GOVERNMENT
HAS COME UP WITH A FOOLPROOF WAY
TO STOP YOU FROM DOING IT AND
THIS TIME IT'S REALLY GO TO
WORK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE F.D.A. IS ROLLING OUT THE
MOST GRAPHIC WARNINGS YET
COVERING HALF THE CIGARETTE PACK
>> REALLY?
HOW WILL THIS IMAGE GET US TO
QUIT SMOKING WHEN IT'S BASICALLY
THE SAME IMAGE THAT GETS US TO
BUY A MOVIE TICKET?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE TRUTH IS YOU'LL NEVER
DISCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM
SMOKING BY SAYING IT WILL KILL
THEM.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KEEP THEM
FROM LIGHTING UP, LAUNCH A
PROSMOKING CAMPAIGN THAT LINKS
CIGARETTES TO VIRGINITY.
[LAUGHTER]
OR BETTER YET, I LIKE THE VERY
REAL LINK BETWEEN CIGARETTES AND
NOT HAVING ANY MONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
MEANWHILE, THE ONE THING PEOPLE
WON'T STAND FOR, THE GOVERNMENT
INTERFERING WITH OUR TRAVEL
PLANS.
>> THE ANGER CONTINUES TO BUILD
OVER WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
WHEN YOU GO TO THE AIRPORT.
>> FULL BODY SCANNING AT
AIRPORTS.
THEY ARE CALLING THE SCREENINGS
A HEALTH RISK AND INVASIVE.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF OBJECTIONS
HERE.
THE HEALTH CONCERNS, THE PRIVACY
CONCERNS.
I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS
BECOME INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED.
>> I SEE SO IN THE NAME OF
FIGHTING TERRORISM WE'RE WILLING
TO START WARS, WATERBOARD PEOPLE
AND KILL CIVILIANS WITH UNMANNED
DRONES BUT THE ONE LINE WE WON'T
CROSS IS OUR WAIST LINE.
BUT IF SCANNERS ARE TOO MUCH FOR
YOU YOU CAN OPT FOR A GOOD OLD
FASHIONED PAT DOWN.
>> WE'RE DOING A GROIN CHECK.
I'LL PUT A HAND HERE AND A HAND
ON YOUR INNER THY.
YOU CAN HAVE THE SCREENING.
>> IF YOU TOUCH MY JUNK, I'M
GOING TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WAIT A SECOND!
I GET TO GO FROM NEW YORK TO SAN
DIEGO IN FIVE HOURS AND SOMEONE
TOUCHES MY BALLS?
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL!
[LAUGHTER]
MAYBE I SHOULD CHARGE THEM A
BAGGAGE HANDLING FEE.
[LAUGHTER]
THEN AT LEAST WE CAN TAKE
COMFORT THAT THERE ARE SOME
ACTIVITIES THAT GOVERNMENT CAN
NEVER REGULATE LIKE THE SIMPLE
ACT OF BEING HAPPY.
>> SAN FRANCISCO IS TAKING THE
HAPPY OUT OF YOUR CHILDREN'S
FAST FOOD MEAL.
LAWMAKER AS PROVED A BAN ON TOYS
IN MEALS HIGH IN CALORIES AND
HIGH IN FAT.
>> SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:
THE TOWN THAT GIVES AWAY CLEAN
SYRINGES TO HEROIN ADDICTS WON'T
LET YOUR KID HAVE A BUZZ
LIGHTYEAR WITH HIS HAPPY MEAL
BECAUSE IT SENDS THE WRONG
MESSAGE.
NO WONDER NO NO ONE ESCAPED ESCAPED FROM
ALCATRAZ, IT WAS MORE FUN THAN
LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO.
COME ON SAN FRANCISCO, IF YOU
WERE ANY MORE OF A NANNY STATE
YOU WOULD BE REGULATING BABIES.
FIRST A BAN ON HAPPY MEAL TOYS
NOW SAN FRANCISCO MIGHT CONSIDER
BANG CIRCUMSIGNIFICANCE.
>> APPARENTLY YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR
HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT YOUR
FORESKIN IS GOING HOME WITH YOU.
[ APPLAUSE ]
WHERE DID THEY EVEN GET THE IDEA
FOR SUCH A CRAZY LAW?
I GUESS THEY ARE JUST BOWING TO
POPULAR PRESSURE.
>> IF YOU TOUCH MY JUNK, I'M
GOING TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED.
>> JON?
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LEWIS BLACK.
PICK UP HIS THIRD BOOK.
