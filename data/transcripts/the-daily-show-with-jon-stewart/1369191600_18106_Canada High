>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
MAN WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
COMING ON THE PROGRAM
TONIGHT, 11 TIME NBA
CHAMPION COACH PHIL JACKSON
WILL BE JOINING US.
PHIL JACKSON, THE LEAST
KNOWN MEMBER OF THE JACKSON
5.
LISTEN TO THIS, WHO'S THAT
TALL WHITE GUY?
STANDING NEXT TO TITO?
WE ALL KNOW NATIONAL
POLITICS IS-- BUT LOCAL
GOVERNMENT AIN'T BEAN BAG,
PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF
THAT MEANT.
JUST PHRASES I PICKED UP
FROM WATCHING ANY RANDOM 30
SECONDS OF CHRIS MATTHEWS.
BUT MY POINT IS THIS, EVEN
MAYOR, MAYORS CAN FIND
THEMSELVES EMBROILED IN
SCANDAL WHETHER IT IS THE
WAY THEY REACT TO LOCAL
COMPLAINTS ABOUT RAISE
PROFILING OF HISPANICS.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT
LATINO COMMUNITY TODAY.
>> I MIGHT HAVE TACOS WHEN I
GO HOME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I WILL NEVER TIRE OF
TACO MAYOR.
LIKE THE SNACK HE BELIEVES
WILL EASE THE TENSION
BETWEEN HIS OFFICE AND
LATINO COMMUNITY, I CAN
NEVER GET ENOUGH.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT
MAYORS IS THEY CAN MAINTAIN
THE EXCENTRICITIES THAT GET
SANDED OFF AND FOCUS GROUPED
OUT OF STATEWIDE OR NATIONAL
POLITICIAN, ENDEARING
POLICIES LIKE FEAR OF LARGE
BEVERAGES.
OR BEING A NINE AND A HALF
FINGERED BULGARIAN OR HAVING
MEAT AND CHEESE FOR A HEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
GUESS WHICH ONE OF THOSE
MAYORS IS NOT KOSHER.
GUY WITH THE CHEESEBURGER
FOR A HEAD.
BUT EVENING AMONGST THE
IDIOSYNCRATIC SOME MAYORS
STAND OUT.
FOR INSTANCE TORONTO MAYOR
FORMER CITY COUNCILMAN WHO
HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR IN
TORONTO FOR HIS LOVE OF
SPORTS-- AND HIS WARM
RELATIONS WITH THE PRESS,
YES, THE CAMERA JUST
ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS MAYOR.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SHOT
FROM THE POV.
CAMERA HE WALKED INTO,
CRIMINAL.
NOW OF COURSE DON'T THINK
THIS GUY IS JUST ALL
PRATFALLS WITH COME DEE, HE
HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED WITH
HIS ARM AROUND A NEO-NAZI
AND EXPLAINED WHY STORES
SHOULD BE OPENED AN
STATUTORY HOLIDAYS THUSLY.
>> WHAT SOME ARE CALLING A
BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT TO
TORONTO'S AGING COMMUNITY.
>> THOSE ORIENTAL PEOPLE
WORKED LIKE DOGS.
THEY WORKED THEIR HEARTS
OUT.
THEY ARE WORKERS NONSTOP.
THEY SLEEP BESIDE THEIR
MACHINES.
THE ORIENTAL PEOPLE, THEY
ARE SLOWLY TAKING OVER.
>> Jon: PERHAPS HE'LL HAVE
TO HAVE SOME EGG ROLLS
TONIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR THAT.
AFTER REPEATED INSTANCES OF
THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR YOU
HAVE GOT TO WONDER, IS THIS
DUDE ON CRACK?
WELL, FUNNY STORY.
>> THERE'S A CELL PHONE
VIDEO THAT SHOWS THE MAYOR
ALLEGEDLY SMOKING A CRACK
PIPE.
>> Jon: HEY, HEY!
DON'T JUDGE HIM.
MAYBE HE'S CLEANING UP THE
CITY BY SMOKING ALL THE
CRACK IN IT.
YOU'RE NEXT, PROSTITUTION
RING.
(LAUGHTER)
THE CELL PHONE VIDEO WHICH
IS APPARENTLY VIEWED BY THE
TORONTO STAR AND THE WEB
SITE GAWKER, IT APPEARS THE
VIDEO SHOWS THE MAYOR OF
TORONTO SMOKING CRACK WITH
DRUG DEALERS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE
DEPUTY MAYOR OF TORONTO.
>> CERTAINLY WE ALL KNOW
THAT VIDEOS CAN BE ALTERED.
AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT
DRUG DEALERS CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.
>> Jon: PHOTOS CAN EASILY BE
ALTERED.
BUT VIDEOS?
THAT'S SOME JAMES CAMERON
[BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, IF YOU CAN ALTER
VIDEOS WHY WOULDN'T YOU
START WITH THESE TWO.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S THE CAMERA ONE THAT
DOES IT EVERY TIME.
WE'VE ALL TRIPPED PLAYING
FOOTBALL BUT-- INTERESTINGLY
FORD'S PERSONAL LAWYER DOES
NOT APPEAR TO BE GOING THE
FAKE VIDEO ROUTE.
THE MAYOR'S LAWYER INTEND
INTEND-- INSTEAD ASKED QUOTE
HOW YOU CAN INDICATE WHAT
THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY DOING
OR SMOKING?
I MEAN THAT CLEAR PIPE IN
HIS HAND COULD BE ANYTHING
FROM ASTHMA MEDICINE TO
WONDER WOMAN'S FAMED
INVISIBLE PIPE OF TRUTH TO A
WATERFORD CRYSTAL KAZOO
