I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GO NOW.
SO, WE WERE ON VACATION.
WHEN WE LAST CHECKED IN WITH
OUR COVERAGE OF MESOPOTAMIA IT
WAS ABOUT A WEEK AGO EGYPTIANS
WERE STILL DEMONSTRATING FOR
REGIME CHANGE BY THE HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS WHILE THE NEW
TECHNOLOGY FORCES FOR CHANGE
EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO COLD
KOCH ANDERSON COOPER.
I HOPE YOU'LL EXCUSE THE
EXPRESSION.
( APPLAUSE )
I WILL...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WILL... I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP
JOKE TO THAT THAT I WILL KEEP
TO MYSELF.
LEAVE COOP ALONE.
HE'S ALL WE HAVE.
SINCE THEN MUBARAK HAS STEPPED
DOWN.
THE MUMMY'S CURSE WAS BROKEN.
THE CROWDS WERE JOYFUL.
THE ONLY DANGER JOURNALISTS
FACED WAS A DAUNTING CASE OF
FREEDOM HERPES.
WOW.
ANDERSON COOPER HAS AGED A LOT
IN ONE WEEK.
APPARENTLY THAT'S HARRY SMITH
WHO I'M BEING TOLD RIGHT NOW
BY MY PRODUCER
