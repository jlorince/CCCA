LOOKING IN THE MIRROR GOING,
"YEAH I'D (bleep) ME."
HE GET IN TROUBLE FOR IMPLYING
HE WAS NOT 100% SURE THAT BARACK
OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS
AUTHENTIC.

PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
IT'S FUN TO POKE AT HIM SAYING

ONE TIME WE WERE EXECUTING THIS
FELLA AND, I CALLED THAT
INFUSION ROOM BEFORE MIDNIGHT

THROWN OUT OF GAME.

SOME FUN.
HE IS NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE OUT THERE WITH A SENSE
OF HUMOR.
HERE IS HERMAN CAIN COMPLAINING
WHY HE SAID HE WANTED AN
ELECTRIFIED FENCE ACROSS THE
MEXICAN BORDER.
>> LET ME SAY IT WAS A JOKE.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT WAS A
GOOD JOKE.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT A JOKE YOU
SHOULD MAKE IF YOU ARE A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
APOLOGIZE IF YOU OFFENDED
ANYONE.
>> Jon: YOU CAN CATCH MORE OF
HIS COMEDY STYLINGS ON THE NEXT
TONE DEAF COMEDY JAM.
HE APOLOGIZES FOR THE JOKE ABOUT
ELECTRIFYING THE FENCE.
HE SAID ONE MORE SENTENCE AND
THEN SAYS THIS.

COMBINE COMBINATION OF A FENCE
THAT MIGHT BE ELECTIFIED.

INJECTION AND SHE SUFFERED FROM
MENTAL RETARDATION THEREAFTER.
