[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WE BEGIN... WE DON'T ACTUALLY
SAY THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
VERY RESPECTFUL IN THE OLD
NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
REPUBLICAN FIELD FOR THE
PRESIDENCY, WHICH DESPITE NOW
BOASTING NO FEWER THAN EIGHT
VIABLE CANDIDATES AND NEWT
GINGRICH HAS STILL LEFT THE
REPUBLICAN BASE LOOKING FOR
ALTERNATIVES, BUT ARE THERE
ALTERNATIVES LOOKING FOR THEM?
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
INDECISION 2012 INDECISION
EDITION.
CHRIS CHRISTIE, NEW JERSEY
GOVERNOR AND PART-TIME BOBBY
BAKALA IMPERSONATOR SPOKE LAST
NIGHT AT THE HOLIEST SITE IN
REPUBLICANISM, THE REAGAN
LIBRARY, AND WAS PROPOSITIONED
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
>> ARE YOU RECONSIDERING OR ARE
YOU STANDING FIRM?
>> LISTEN, I'LL BE REALLY
SUCCINCT ABOUT THIS.
I SAW SOMETHING GREAT ON THE
POLITICAL WEB SITE, AND I DON'T
MEAN TO BE AN ADVERTISER FOR
PLITICO, BUT THEY PUT 1:353 OF
MY ANSWERS BACK TO BACK TO BACK
TO BACK.
EVERYONE GO TO POLITICO.COM.
IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE.
CLICK ON IT.
THOSE ARE THE ANSWERS.
>> Jon: OH, IT'S LIKE A
TREASURE HUNT.
I LOVE IT.
IT'S LIKE A LIVE LINKING TO
ANOTHER WEB SITE.
FOLLOW THE CLUES AND REVEAL THE
SECRET MESSAGE.
>> YOU'RE STILL SAYING
CATEGORICALLY NOT RUNNING.
>> I'M NOT RUNNING.
I'M 100% CERTAIN I'M NOT GOING
TO RUN.
>> I DON'T WANT THE RUN.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M READY TO
RUN.
FIRST IN YOUR HEART YOU HAVE TO
WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
I DON'T WANT IT THAT BADLY.
>> Jon:, INSECURITIABLE.
WHEN URGED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT,
CHRIS CHRISTIE POINTS PEOPLE TO
A TWO-MINUTE MONTAGE OF
UNEQUIVOCAL, NO, I AM NOT
RUNNING.
INTERPRET THAT FOR US, OH GREAT
POLITICAL PUNDITS.
>> NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS
CHRISTIE APPEARS TO LEAVE THE
DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN.
>> CHRISTIE LEFT THE DOOR
SLIGHTLY OPEN.
>> FOR HIMSELF.
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS LEFT THE
DOOR OPEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY.
>> JUST A SLIVER OPEN.
HE LEFT A LITTLE SLIVER OPEN.
>> CHRISTIE'S COMMENTS
ESPECIALLY ARE A RORSCHACH TEST,
SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE, HEAR
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.
>> YOU HEAR WHAT YOU WANT TO
HEAR.
EVERYONE ELSE HEARS, I'M NOT
RUNNING.
A RORSCHACH TEST?
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S A RORSCHACH
TEST.
IT'S A RORSCHACH TEST.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WAS THAT A BUTTERFLY HUMPING A
MONGOOSE?
[LAUGHTER]
HE SAID NO.
AND IF I REMEMBER FROM MY
FRESHMAN DORM ORIENTATION
CORRECTLY, NO MEANS NO!
SO BACK UP, NO, OH, COME ON,
BABY, CAN'T WE JUST FORM AN
EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE.
COME ON, LET ME TOUCH YOUR
SUPER PAC.
NO CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS GIVEN YOU
HIS ANSWER.
STOP GRINDING UP AGAINST HIM AND
ASKING IF YOU CAN JUST PUT THE
TIP IN.
