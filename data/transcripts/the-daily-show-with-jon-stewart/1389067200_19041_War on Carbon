GLOBAL WARMING ONE MORE LIBERALGCONSPIRACY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
THERE'SA GREAT DEAL OF SCIENTIFIC D
EVEN THOUGH THE MODELS OF GLOBALWARMING PREDICT EXTREMES OF
WEATHER, NOT JUST WARMING,APPARENTLY PEER REVIEWED
SCIENTIFIC STUDY CAN BE, LIKE AFICUS TREE, DESTROYED IN ONE
COLD WEEKEND.

THAT'S YOUR (bleep) OPINION.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT MEANS NOTHING.
[LAUGHTER]SORRY.
GUYS, SETTLE DOWN.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT IT'S YOUR OPINION.
BASED ON ITS FLAVOR I THINK LEADPAINT IS GOOD TO DRINK.
THAT'S MY OPINION.
PEEING INTO THE FOUNTAIN THESAME TIME AS ANOTHER PERSON IS A
GOOD WAY TO SWITCH SOULS WITHTHEM.
MY OPINION.
>> IF 97 DOCTORS TOLD YOU THELUMP ON YOUR LUNG WAS SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT AND THREESCIENTISTS, DOCTORS TOLD YOU NOT
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
>> IF 97 WERE PAID TO TELL METHERE WAS A LUMP ON MY LUNG AND
IT WAS BAD, I'D LISTEN TO THETHREE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THAT IS HOWDOCTORS GET PAID, RIGHT?
YOU GO TO THEM AND THEY CHARGETO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT YOUR
PROBLEM.
ALTHOUGH I THINK I FIGURED OUTWHERE THE LUMP IS.

YOU CAN'T TRUST THESESCIENTISTS.
THEIR JUDGMENT IS CLOUDED BYMONEY.
WHY DO YOU OPPOSE THESESCIENTISTS?
>> I THINK IT BORDERS ON LUNACYTO THROW DARE I SAY TRILLIONS AT
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT BE.

BUSINESSES.

MILLIONS BY DENYING CLIMATECHANGE IS UNIMPEACHABLE.
BUT KEEP AN EYE ONTHOSE GLOBAL WARMING
THOUSAND-AIRES.
I NEVERTRUSTED THEM SINCE I
FOUND OUT ONE OF ELEMENTS ON THEPERIODIC TABLE, GOLD.

MR. TRUMP WOULD NEVER CONCEALBALD-FACED TRUTH OR GO THROUGH
ANY EFFORT TO HIDE WHENSOMETHING IS CLEARLY RECEDING
OVER THE YEARS.

SENIOR CLIMATE CORRESPONDENTJESSICA WILLIAMS.

ISSUE OF SCIENCE BECOME PART OFTHE CULTURE WAR?

CAN SHOOT OR HOW MANY TIMES WECAN SHOOT IT.
