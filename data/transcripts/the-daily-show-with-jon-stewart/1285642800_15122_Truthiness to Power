SUKOT.
FINE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
FROM FOX'S NEWS THE O'REILLY
FACTOR BILL FACTOR.
[LAUGHTER]
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BY NOW LAST
FRIDAY COMEDIAN STEPHEN COLBERT
RUINED CONGRESS.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT CONTENT WITH SABOTAGING MY
RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY, OCTOBER
30, WASHINGTON, D.C., NOON TO
3:00.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOT SATISFIED WITH SABOTAGING
THIS WITH THIS POPULAR KEEP FEAR
ALONG JAM BOREEE STEPHEN COLBERT
HAS MOCKED OUR LEGISLATORS TO
THEIR FACES WHEN HE WENT TO
WASHINGTON, WALKED INTO A
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM AND
TESTIFIED ON THE PLIGHT OF
UNDOCUMENTED FARM WORKERS, STEAL
HAVING A JOB THAT IS
TRADITIONALLY DONE BY BASEBALL
PLAYERS ON STEROIDS AND NOT
REALLY AT ALL APOLOGETIC
C.E.O.S.
>> CONGRESSWOMAN LOFGREN ASKED
ME TO SHARE MY VAST EXPERIENCE
SHARING ONE DAY AS A MIGRANT
WORKER.
>> I WAS A CORN PACKER.
I KNOW IT'S OFFENSIVE TO SOME
BECAUSE CORN PACKER SAY DERING
DEROGATORY TERM FOR A GAY
ISLAND.
>> Jon: HA, HA.
IT'S ALSO OFFENSIVE TO THE
FOOTBALL ARENA FRANCHISE THE
GREEN CORN PACKERS.
[LAUGHTER]
HAVE I BEEN WORKING OUT?
THANK YOU WHOEVER PHOTO SHOPPED
THAT PICTURE.
I WASN'T THE ONLY COMPLETELY
HUMOROUS C-SPANIARD WHO IS
OFFENSIVE.
>> THIS IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND
THEY ARE COLBERT AS THE FIRST
GUY.
>> IT'S AN INSULT TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> THEY'VE GOT TIME TO BRING A
COMEDIAN TO WASHINGTON, D.C. BUT
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TIME TO
ELIMINATE THE UNCERTAIN BY
EXTENDING THE TAX RATES.
>> I THINK IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT
FOR MR. COLBERT MORE THAN THE
HOUSE.
>> Jon: OF COURSE COLBERT IS
MORE EMBARRASSED THAN THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES.
COLBERT STILL HAS DIGNITY AND
INTEGRITY LEFT TO LOSE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU CAN'T EMBARRASS CONGRESS.
HOW COULD YOU?
YOU CAN'T EMBARRASS THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
THEY ARE THE ANDY DICK OF OUR
GOVERNMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU MAKE OUT WITH
ANDY DICK HE IS NOT THE ONE
WORRIED ABOUT COLD SORES.
[LAUGHTER]
COLBERT'S LOUDEST CRITIC MIGHT
HAVE BEEN IOWA REPUBLICAN STEVE
KING, HERO, WHO IMMEDIATELY
RUSHED FROM THE TIME WASTING
HEARING TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK
COMPLAIN ON FOX NEWS ABOUT TIME
WASTED.
>> YOU KNOW HOW COMEDIANS ARE.
THEY ARE ALWAYS GLAD TO GET
CAMERA TIME.
>> Jon: HE IS AANYTHING HOW
ENAMORED CERTAIN CONGRESSMEN ARE
WITH SEEING THEMSELVES ON CAMERA
TO BE FAIR TO STEVE KING DOES HE
BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL WITH HIS
SIDE BUSINESS TO PROTECT HIS
CURRENT AGAINST TINY MEXICANS.
>> WE COULD ELECTRIFY THIS WIRE
WITH THE KIND OF CURRENT THAT
WOULDN'T KILL SOMEBODY BUT WOULD
BE A DISCOURAGEMENT FROM THEM.
WE DO IT WITH LIVESTOCK ALL THE
TIME.
>> Jon: YES, IT DOES WORK WITH
LIVESTOCK BUT IN THIS CASE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS.
THERE WAS ONE PERSON MORE WORKED
UP WITH STEVE KING.
HIS INTERVIEWER.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT ZOE LUF
DBREN OWES THE TAXPAYERS AN
APOLOGY FOR WASTING TAXPAYER
TIMES.
THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN
THIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: TRUE.
THE COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE TEN
MINUTES THAT IT TOOK FOR COLBERT
TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS
THEREBY GIVING MASSIVE MEDIA
ATTENTION TO THE MASSIVE ISSUE
OF MIGRANT FARM WORKERS.
>> CONGRESSMAN THANK FOR BEING
HERE.
>> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT.
>> TIP YOUR HAT TO JOHN CONYER
CALLING OUT A FELLOW DEMOCRAT.
A NEW SECRET FOR LINDSAY LOHAN.
A SCAL FORN JUDGE SENDING HER
BACK TO JAIL WITH NO BAIL.
>> Jon: IN A PAIL.
SHE'S GOT MAIL.
[LAUGHTER]
OPRAH'S BEST FRIEND IS GAYLE.
I LOVE RHYMES.
I'M SORRY, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTRY.
THE FACT IS THE SO-CALLED
COMEDIAN WASN'T EVEN FUNNY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING
THAT.
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY, I
DON'T WANT A TOMATO PICKED BY
AND AMERICAN I WANT IT PICKED BY
A GUATEMALA AND SLICES BY HIS
CHILEAN IN A SPA WHERE I GET A
BRAZILLAN.
[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NO, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
NOBODY CONGRESS LAUGHED AAT
LAUGH.
THEY ONLY LAUGHED AT ONE INNING
IN REALLY.
>> I TRUST THAT FOLLOWING MY
TESTIMONY BOTH SIDES WILL WORK
TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE IN THE
BEST INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AS YOU ALWAYS DO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT THEY
LAUGHED AT IN THE ROOM.
SEE IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE IT'S
SAD.
SO THEY COMPLAINED WHEN COLBERT
WAS BEING FUNNY.
WHAT ABOUT WHEN HE WAS BEING
SERIOUS.
HE MADE A PERFECT PLEA FOR THE
PLIGHT OF THE WORKER AND QUOTED
SCRIPTURE WHICH FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND IS THE GOOD BOOK,
SOMETHING WAL-MART WOULD SELL.
>> ANY COMIC WHO SAID I'M HERE
TO SPEAK FOR PEOPLE WITH NO
VOICE IS NO LONGER A COMIC BUT A
POMPOUS JERK.
>>
>> Jon: YES AS OPPOSED TO
ARROGANT DOUCHE WHO DECIDES WHO
IS AND IS NOT A COMIC.
TUCKER AND I CAN TALK LIKE THIS
BECAUSE WE HAVE A VISCERAL
NEGATIVE REACTION TO EACH OTHER.
NOT AN OUNCE OF FRIENDSHIP OR
RESPECT BETWEEN US.
TRULY ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE IN
THE WORLD I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT.
SURE, THIS IS REALLY ABOUT
CONGRESS.
THANK GOD WITH COLBERT GONE THEY
CAN GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS AT
HAND.
>> THE U.S. SENATE FAILED TO
MOVE FORWARD ON REPEALING DON'T
ASK DON'T TELL.
