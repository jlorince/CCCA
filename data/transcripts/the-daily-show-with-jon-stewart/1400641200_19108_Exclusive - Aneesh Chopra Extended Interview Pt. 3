SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO, AND MAYBEI'M BEATING DEAD HORSE --
>> NO, I HEAR YA.
>> Jon: -- BUT IT STRIKES ME ASIS THE PROBLEM RESISTANCE WITHIN
THE RANKS OF V.A. AND DoD ANDNOT WITH THE AVAILABLE
TECHNOLOGIES? I GUESS, THAT'S MYPOINT.
>> I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE.
THERE IS PROBABLY A BIT OFMANAGEMENT CHALLENGE AS WELL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE TALKED IN THE BOOK ABOUTTHE FIRST TIME WE GOT A MESSAGE
AT THE WHITE HOUSE THERE WAS APROBLEM GETTING VETERANS THEIR
EDUCATION BENEFITS, THE POST9/11 BENEFITS, WE LITERALLY FLEW
DOWN AND SAID THE TECHNOLOGIESTECHNICALLY WERE THERE TO
ANSWER SOME SIMPLE QUESTIONS,ARE THEY ELIGIBLE FOR THE
BENEFIT, HOW MUCH DOTHEY GET. BUT THE EMPLOYEES, WE
SAT WITH THEM 24 HOURS AFTERTHE WHITE HOUSE SAID THIS
WAS A PROBLEM, GET DOWNTHERE AND ADDRESS IT, WE SAW YOU
HAD TO OPEN UP 13 DIFFERENTSCREENS TO ANSWER JUST A FEW
SIMPLE QUESTIONS SO THE WORKERSSPENT MUCH LONGER THAN
THEY NEEDED TO TRY AND CONNECTALL THESE DOTS.
SO WE DIDN'T HAVEAN I.T. SOLUTION IMMEDIATELY
AT HAND, IT WAS AMANAGEMENT SOLUTION. IN FACT,
JEB ZION LED THE TEAM AND HEACTUALLY PUT IN PLACE A
MANAGMENT THAT CUT THATBACKLOG DOWN.
>> Jon: IF THEY SENTYOU TO THE V.A., LET'S SAY THEY
SENT YOU TO THE V.A. OR THEDoD --
>> THEY HAVE GREAT PEOPLE DOINGTHIS NOW.
>> Jon: I KNOW, NO, THEY HAVEGREAT PEOPLE THAT'RE WORKING
VERY HARD, IT'S JUST THAT ITMAY BE IT IS A FUNCTION OF
A LACK OF CENTRALITY ORSOMETHING. BUT LET'S SAY THEY
SENT YOU OVER THERE AND YOULOOKED AT THE SYSTEM AND YOU
SAID, OH, I SEE YOUR I.T.PROBLEM, AT LEAST, YOU'RE
USING PAPER AND THAT DOESN'TWORK AS WELL IN COMPUTERS.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY25-YEARS-OLD ELECTRONIC
TECHNOLOGY, BUT IHEAR YOU.
>> Jon: OK. SO THAT DOESN'TWORK.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO HERE'S THETHREE-STEP THING THAT WILL HELP
US MODERNIZE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SCAN ALL THE FILES
>> WHICH THEY'RE DOING.
>> Jon: CREATE A DATABASE.
>> WHICH THEY'RE DOING.
>> Jon: HAVE THE DATABASECOMMUNICATE WITH THE DoD
DATABASE SO THAT WHEN VETSGET OUT, THEY'RE IMMEDIATELY
CONNECTED WITH THE V.A., THOSERECORDS INTERFACE, SO THEY CAN
WALK INTO ANY V.A. HOSPITAL INTHE THING AND IF THAT SYSTEM
CAN'T HANDLE IT, GET THEM ONMEDICAIRE, PUT THEM ON MEDICARE,
GIVE THEM WHATEVER IT IS THATIT TAKES TO GET THEM -- IS IT,
AM I OVERSIMPLIFYING ITBY BEING NAIVE?
>> LET ME BE CAREFUL, IN THEAMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WRIT
LARGE THE ABILITY OF TWONON-CONNECTED SYSTEMS TO TALK TO
EACH OTHER IS STILL A PROBLEMBECAUSE THE DATABASES, WHEN THEY
WERE BUILT JUST FOR THEIRPRIMARY USE, THE ABILITY TO TAKE
INFORMATION AND SHARE IT WITHOTHERS WAS NOT PART OF THE
ORIGINAL DESIGN.
SO AFTER THE FACT, IF YOU TRY TOSTITCH THESE THINGS TOGETHER,
YOU DON'T WANT TO INTRODUCEERROR.
YOU DON'T WANT TO STITCH THEMTOGETHER JUST BY BRUTE FORCE AND
SAY, HEY, IS THIS WORKING ANDRUN THE RISK YOU HAVE THE WRONG
MEDICATION LIST FOR THE PATIENTAND ISSUED THE WRONG DOSE.
THAT'S INTRODUCING HARM.
SO, THE REASON WHY I SAIDEMPOWER THEM DIRECTLY, THE
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THE DATA CANGIVE IT TO YOU.
>> Jon: WHO'S GOT THE DATA?
>> EACH INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM. THEDoD HAS ITS DATA. THE V.A. HAS
ITS DATA. IN THE PRIVATE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, THEY HAVE THEIR
DATA. AND IF WE EMPOWER THE,  IHEAR YOU.
YOU DON'T WANT THE VETERAN TOHAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WORK
OF GETTING THEIR DATA, BUTIT'S --
>> Jon: THEY'RE ALREADY DOINGIT.
>> IT IS SAFE, SECURE, AND THEIRFAMILIES -- I WOULD RATHER MY
COLLEAGUE -->> Jon: YOU WOULD RECOMMEND
NOT HAVING A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM?
>> THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONGTIME. LOTS OF MONEY.
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK THROUGHTHAT PROCESS.
>> Jon: WHY IS THAT? I GUESSTHAT'S MY POINT IS WHY WILL THAT
TAKE SO LONG?
>> YOU HAVE A LEGACY DATABASETHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MODERNIZE. MANYOF THESE INITIAL
SYSTEMS WEREN'T BUILT WITH THESEMODERN APPROACHES.
NOT A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, BUTEVERY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED
STATES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATESECTOR. SO, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS
EMPOWER PEOPLE TO LIVEBETTER LIVES AND ALLOW THEM TO
LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. NO,THE IDEA IS --
>> IT'S A START. YOU WANT TOSTART WHERE YOU CAN HAVE AN
IMPACT AND YOU WANT TO MAKE ANIMPACT THAT EMPOWERS THEIR LIVES
TODAY, NOT A 20-YEAR PLANTHAT'S GONNA  SPEND $50 BILLION.
>> Jon: SO THIS LEGACYINFORMATION SYSTEM THAT EXISTS
IN OUR COUNTRY --
>> FOR EVERYWHERE, FOR PUBLIC,PRIVATE SECTOR, YEAH.
>> OR EVERYWHERE. WILL NOTTURN OVER IN 20 YEARS
BECAUSE, BY THEN, MY GUESS ISROBOTS WILL HAVE ALREADY TAKEN
OVER.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BY THAT POINT, YOU'REONLY HELPING, I WOULD THINK, THE
SENTIENT APES WHO HAVE NOWLEARNED HOW TO USE WEAPONRY AND
ARE NOW COMING AFTER US BECAUSETHEY FIGURED OUT HOW
TO CENTRALIZE THEIR INFORMATIONA FEW YEARS EARLIER.
>> BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THELESSONS, IF YOU LOOK --
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: IT JUST, IT DOESN'T, ITDOESN'T SEEM PLAUSIBLE.
IT DOESN'T SEEM PLAUSIBLE TOWATCH THEM DO WHAT THEY DID
WITH healthcare.gov AND THENSAY, YEAH, NO, BUT DoD AND V.A.
WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACHOTHER FOR 20 YEARS.
IT DOESN'T SEEM PLAUSIBLE.
>> THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOMAKE THE SYSTEMS CONNECT, BUT
I'M TELLING YOU, IN ORDER TO GETGOING FAST, THERE ARE SMARTER,
MORE AGILE WAYS OF BUILDING THETECHNOLOGY SO YOU CAN CONNECT --
>> Jon: SO, WHAT YOU'RESUGGESTING IS A
SUB INFRASTRUCTURE --UNDERNEATH, ALMOST LIKE LET'S
SAY WE HAVE FAILING BRIDGES,LET'S SAY HYPOTHETICALLY.
>> HYPOTHETICALLY.
>> Jon: HYPOTHETICALLY, LET'SSAY THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS
COUNTRY IS FALLING APART,BRIDGES, RAILS, ET CETERA,
BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON ONEGROUP DOESN'T FUND ANYTHING.
>> BUT THEY FUNDED A WIRELESSINITIATIVE.
THE BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TOFUND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE TO
MAKE GOOD ON THE FINALRECOMMENDATION OF THE 9/11
COMMISSION WE HADN'T IMPLEMENTTO GIVE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST
RESPONDERS INTEROPERABLECOMMUNICATIONS.
SO THEY BUILT THEINFRASTRUCTURE.
>> Jon: IT LITERALLY TAKES9/11 TO GET BOTH SIDES TO AGREE
ON THE IDEA OF WI-FI.
ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)>> WI-FI FOR SAFETY.
