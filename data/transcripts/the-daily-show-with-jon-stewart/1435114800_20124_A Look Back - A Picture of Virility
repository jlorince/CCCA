YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN HAVING ALOT OF FUN TONIGHT WITH THE
TRUMP THING.
MY LAST FEW SHOWS, I WANT TOTALK ABOUT A MORE SERIOUS
SUBJECT.
SOMETHING, A BIT OF A PET CAUSEOF MINE THAT I BELIEVE HAS
FAILED TO RECEIVE THE ATTENTIONTHAT I THINK IT DESEVES.
I'M SPEAKING OF COURSE OF THEHUMBLE CORNICHON.
IT'S A PICKEL, BUT SMALLER.
NOW, THEY DON'T LOOK TO BEPARTICULARLY SATISFYING, AND TO
BE PERFECTLY FRANK, THEY AREN'T
BUT THEY'RE THE PERFECTCOMPLEMENT TO THE TINY CORN.
NOW YOU TAKE THE TINY PICKLE ANDTHE TINY CORN AND THEY MAKE THE
PERFECT --
>> ACTUALLY, JON, IF I COULDSAY A FEW WORDS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE -- HASAN! I'MIN THE MIDDLE OF MY HEARTFELT
PLEA FOR GARNEE EQUALITY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT.
>> JON, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOUR16 YEARS HERE ON THE DAILY SHOW
AND I'VE JUST BEEN BLOWN AWAY BYYOUR AMAZING TRANSFORMATION.
>> Jon: HASAN, THAT'S VERY KINDOF YOU.
>> YES, I MEAN WHEN YOU STARTEDOUT, YOU WERE SMALL, WEAK,
VULNERABLE.
BUT OVER THE YEARS WE WATCH YOUBLOOM, BECOMING STRONGER,
FITTER, ALMOST YOUNGER.
YOUR HAIR TRANSFORMING FROMDECREPIT GRAY TO JET BLACK.
>> Jon: HASAN, IS THERE ANYCHANCE  YOU WERE WATCHING
THE SHOWS BACKWARDS?
>> PROBABLY, YEAH.
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY RECOGNIZEWHATEVER THIS IS.
[LAUGHTER]
EITHER WAY, THE TIME HAS COME TOSALUTE YOUR STAMINA AND VIGOR
OVER THIS NEARLY 17-YEARMARATHON.
