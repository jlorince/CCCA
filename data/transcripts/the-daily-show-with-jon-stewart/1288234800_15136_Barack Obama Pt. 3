YOU EXPRESSED SOME FRUSTRATION
WITH THOSE ON THE LEFT THAT ARE
STILL FEELING DISSATISFIED.
DO YOU THINK IN ANY WAY THE
EXPECTATION WAS SOMETHING THAT
MAYBE EVEN YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN
CREATED?
WERE PEOPLE BEING NAIVE... I
REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY YOU SAID,
WE CAN'T EXPECT DIFFERENT
RESULTS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND I REMEMBER WHEN
YOU HIRED LARRY SOMERS.
( LAUGHTER )
I REMEMBER THINKING, WELL, THAT
SEEMS LIKE THE EXACT SAME
PERSON.
( LAUGHTER )
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Jon: AND WHY WOULD YOU...
SO IN SOME RESPECTS I GET YOUR
FRUSTRATION WITH THIS IDEA THAT,
WELL, GEEZ, ARE YOU NEVER
SATISFIED, BUT AGAIN, THE
EXPECTATION I THINK WAS
AUDACITY, GOING IN THERE AND
REALLY ROOTING OUT A CORRUPT
SYSTEM, AND SO THE SENSE IS, HAS
REALITY OF WHAT HIT YOU IN THE
FACE WHEN YOU FIRST STEPPED IN
CAUSED YOU TO BACK DOWN FROM
SOME OF THE MORE VISIONARY, LIKE
BRINGING IN A GUY LIKE LARRY
SOMERS.
>> FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU LOOK AT
HOW WE HAVE HANDLED THIS
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IF YOU HAD TOLD ME TWO YEARS
AGO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM,
STABILIZE THE STOCK MARKET,
STABILIZE THE ECONOMY AND, BY
THE WAY, AT THE END OF THIS
THING, IT WILL COST LESS THAN 1%
OF G.D.P. WHERE THE SN L COST US
2.5%, I'D SAY I'LL TAKE IT
BECAUSE WE SAVED TAXPAYERS A
HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY.
IN FAIRNESS, LARRY SUMMERS DID A
HECK OF A JOB TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO...
>> Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO USE
THAT PHRASE, DUDE.
>> PUN INTENDED.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> LARRY WAS INTEGRAL IN HELPING
TO THINK THROUGH SOME REALLY
COMPLICATED STUFF.
NOW, THE NOTION IS I THINK THAT
SOMEHOW MANAGING A CRISIS OF
THIS MAGNITUDE IS A MATTER OF
BLACK AND WHITE AND YOU GOT SOME
CLEAR DECISIONS THAT YOU CAN
MAKE, AND HERE'S HOW YOU CAN DO
IT, SHUT DOWN THESE BANKS AND
PUSH THIS STUFF ASIDE AND
SOMEHOW IT'S ALL GOING TO BE
RIGHT.
IT TURNS OUT THAT AT EVERY
JUNCTURE WHERE WE'RE MAKING
DECISIONS, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
SOME CALCULATIONS.
IF YOU SHUT DOWN THIS BANK, DOES
THAT MEAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE A CASCADE OF 100 OTHER
BANKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SHUT
DOWN?
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE
TAXPAYERS SUDDENLY HAVE TO PAY
FOR ALL THAT?
IS THAT GOING TO COST MORE
TAXPAYER MONEY?
A LOT OF THE DEBATES ARE TAKING
PLACE IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL
REGULATORY REFORM, IN TERMS OF
HOW TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL
SYSTEM WERE ONES THAT REQUIRED
SOME EXPERTISE AND LARRY HELPED
TO PROVIDE THAT.
NOW, HAVING SAID THAT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I APPRECIATE YOU.
>> Jon: IT'S SO HARD NOT TO
TALK.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I KNOW.
>> Jon: ASK YOU JUST ONE
QUICK... IF THEY TOLD YOU THE
SAME THING, STABLETIZE BANKS,
STABILIZE THE DOW, UNEMPLOYMENT
IS NEAR 10%, WOULD YOU HAVE TAKE
THAN DEAL?
>> YOU KNOW, IF I HAD THE
CAPACITY TO HAVE PREVENTED THE
UNEMPLOYMENT THAT HAPPENED
BASICALLY BEFORE WE PUT OUR
ECONOMIC PLAN INTO PLACE,
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE DONE
THAT.
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS WE LOST FOUR
MILLION JOBS BEFORE I WAS SWORN
IN, 750,000 JOBS THE MONTH I WAS
SWORN IN, 600,000 THE MONTH
AFTER THAT, 600,000 THE MONTH
AFTER THIS.
SO MOST OF THE JOCKS WE LOST
WERE LOST BEFORE THE ECONOMIC
POLICIES WE PUT INTO PLACE HAD
ANY EFFECT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR
EARLIER POINT, WHICH IS THIS
NOTION THAT, YOU KNOW, FOLKS I
THINK HOPE THAT WE COULD
COMPLETELY TRANSFORM WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: UH-HUH.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT IMPULSE.
THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD PEOPLE
HERE, SOME GOOD PUBLICER IS
VANTDS WHO WORK VERY HARD.
THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO ARE NOT
SO GOOD.
AND THE CULTURE HERE IS NOT
ALWAYS REAL HEALTHY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO...
STUFF OVER THERE.
YEAH.
>> AND SO BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE
IN TERMS OF HOW THE LEGISLATIVE
PROCESS OPERATES, IN TERMS OF
THE POWER THAT LOBBYISTS HAVE,
THE POWER THAT SPECIAL INTERESTS
HAVE, YOU KNOW, THAT IS A WORK
IN PROGRESS.
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
OVERNIGHT, BUT I DON'T REGRET
DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAVING SAID
THAT WE CAN CHANGE THAT PROCESS,
WE CAN MAKE IT MORE TRANSPARENT.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IDEAL.
WE CAN REDUCE THE POWER OF
SPECIAL INTERESTS, ALTHOUGH
SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE STILL
GOING TO HAVE POWER IN A
DEMOCRACY.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
PETITION THEIR GOVERNMENT LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE, AND THEY'VE GOT
A LOT OF LOBBYISTS AND A LOT OF
CASH TO DO IT.
BUT WE CAN LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF
POWER THAT WE HAVE.
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT AS A WHITE
HOUSE WE ARE MORE OPEN THAN
PREVIOUS WHITE HOUSES.
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE FOLKS I'M
SURE WHO DON'T THINK WE'VE
ACHIEVED THE IDEAL.
SO I GUESS ON ALL THESE ISSUES,
MY ATTITUDE IS IF WE'RE MAKING
PROGRESS, STEP BY STEP, INCH BY
INCH, DAY BY DAY, THAT WE ARE
BEING TRUE TO THE SPIRIT OF THAT
CAMPAIGN, AND...
>> Jon: SO YOU WOULDN'T SAY
YOU'D RUN THIS TIME AS A
PRAGMATIST.
YOU WOULD NOT.
IT WOULD BE YES, WE CAN, GIVEN
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
>> I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS,
YES, WE CAN, BUT...
( LAUGHTER )
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
OVERNIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU STILL BELIEVE
GOVERNMENT IS NIMBLE ENOUGH TO
HANDLE THESE 21st CENTURY
CRISES?
IS GOVERNMENT AGILE ENOUGH TO
HANDLE... YOU KNOW, YOU SAID WE
WANT TO BUILD A 21st CENTURY
REGULATORY REGIME FOR BUSINESS.
BY THE TIME GOVERNMENT BUILDS
THAT, OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE THE
22nd CENTURY, BUT WON'T THEY
HAVE ALREADY STARTED TRADING
MOLECULES IN SOME SORT OF WEIRD,
YOU KNOW?
DOES GOVERNMENT STILL HAVE THE
ABILITY TO BE AGILE ENOUGH TO
HANDLE THESE TYPES OF THINGS?
>> I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE
QUESTION.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE A
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE
CHANGED IN OUR POLITICS THAT ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO BE FIXED.
ONE IS THE WAY THE FILIBUSTER
OPERATES.
I MEAN, AS I SAID, THAT'S JUST
NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN FAIRNESS, IN FAIRNESS,
DEMOCRATS USE IT WHEN BUSH WAS
IN OFFICE AND FELT VERY
COMFORTABLE USING IT, ALTHOUGH
NOT TO THE EXTENT IT'S BEEN USED
TODAY.
WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IS
UNPRECEDENTED.
AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD IN
SERIOUS WAYS AND ACTUALLY
REDUCES COMPROMISE BECAUSE WHAT
ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT IF
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THEY CAN
BLOCK ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE 60 VOTES, THEN THEY FEEL NO
NEED TO COMPROMISE.
THAT MEANS THE DEMOCRATS THEN,
THEIR ATTITUDE IS, WELL, WE'RE
NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE.
WE CAN'T GET 60 VOTES AND
EVERYBODY MOVES IN OPPOSITE
DIRECTIONS.
THE SAME THING IS TRUE I THINK
WHEN IT COMES TO HOW OUR
DISTRICTS ARE DRAWN.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF
DISTRICTS THESE DAYS THAT ARE SO
SAFE, 90% DEMOCRAT, 90%
REPUBLICAN, THAT THAT ALSO HELPS
TO POLARIZE THE ELECTORATE.
SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS
THAT ARE STRUCTURAL THAT ARE
PROBABLY GOING TO NEED TO BE
CHANGED.
BUT HAVING SAID ALL, THAT WE
HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS OVER
THE LAST 18 MONTHS THAT FROM AN
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, YOU
KNOW, RANKS UP THERE WITH ANY
LEGISLATIVE SESSION WE'VE SEEN
IN HISTORY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
CONTINUE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS
ON THINGS LIKE ENERGY, WHICH
DIDN'T GET DONE, ON IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
THAT DID NOT GET DONE.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE JUST GOT
TO DO A LOT MORE WORK IN TERMS
OF GENERATING THE KIND OF JOBS
THAT IN SHORT WE'VE GOT A
GROWING MIDDLE CLASS AND THAT
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO LIVE OUT THE
AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS
WHO ARE WORRIED THAT IF WE DON'T
MAKE SERIOUS INVESTMENTS IN
EDUCATION, IN ENERGY, IN
INFRASTRUCTURE, IN RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT, THAT WE'RE GOING TO
START FALLING BEHIND.
>> Jon: WELL, I THANK YOU FOR
BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.
I KNOW YOU'RE A VERY BUSY MAN.
YOU'VE GOT LOTS TO DO.
>> JON, I APPRECIATE THIS.
THE ONE OTHER THING THAT MIGHT
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE, IF YOU
HAD HELD A RALLY TO RESTORE
SANITY TWO YEARS AGO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT WOULD BE... THAT MIGHT HAVE
MADE A DIFFERENCE.
BUT I ENJOYED IT.
CAN I JUST MAKE A PLUG JUST TO
VOTE?
MAKE SURE YOU VOTE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE GOING FOR.
WHEN YOU SAID, "CAN I JUST MAKE
A PLUG," I WAS LIKE, ARE YOU
DROPPING AN ALBUM?
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE.
>> GO OUT THERE AND VOTE
NOVEMBER 2nd.
A LOT OF YOU HAVE EARLY VOTING
IN YOUR STATES.
MAKE SURE TO MAKE USE OF IT.
[HAIL TO THE CHIEF
