YESTERDAY PROFESSIONAL ADD ADVENTURER AND PART TIME SNIDELY WHIPLASH IMPERSONATOR GERALDO
RIVERA WAS IN AFGHANISTAN COVERING THE TALIBAN'S RECENTLY RELAUNCHED SPRING OFFENSIVE
WHERE HE SCORED AN EXCLUSIVE PHONE INTERVIEW WITH A TALIBAN SPOKESPERSON.
>> ALL RIGHT.
OUR DEAR FRIEND, LONG TIME AFGHAN PRODUCER, HE HAS THE TALIBAN SPOKESMAN ON THE LINE.
ASK HOW HE FEELS ABOUT GETTING HIS ASS KICKED.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER)
>> OKAY, TWO THINGS, ONE, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE CELL PHONE RECEPTION IS IN AFGHANISTAN.
HOW MANY BARS DO YOU THINK THAT GUY'S PULLING.
NUMBER TWO-- AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY-- GERALDO, THAT GUY LIVE THERE IS!
(LAUGHTER) MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T ANNOUNCE HIS NAME AND SHOW HIS FACE WHILE
MAKING HIM TAUNT THE TALIBAN FOR YOU.
>> THAT'S GREAT POWER.
YOU GOT 17 DUDES KILLED WHAT DO YOU ACCOMPLISH?
>> ALL RIGHT, HE'S MAKING A SPEECH.
HE'S MAKING A SPEECH, IT'S PROPAGANDA.
WHAT DID HE WIN?
WHAT DID YOU WIN?
JERKOFF, WHAT DID YOU WIN?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON LOCAL CUSTOMS IN AFGHANISTAN BUT I DO THINK TO
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS "JERKOFF" IS CONSIDERED AN INSULT.
(LAUGHTER) MY HOPE IS AKBAR HERE HAS SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH GERALDO TO BE LOOSE WITH HIS PASHTOï¿½r TRANSLATION.
>> ASK HOW HE FEELS ABOUT GETTING HIS ASS KICKED.
>> THE MAN FROM THE CAR OWE CART GAME WOULD LIKE TO INQUIRE HOW YOU ARE FEELING THIS FINE MORNING.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: GERALDO, WHEN YOU RETURN HOME TO THE STATES YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM YOUR
NEIGHBORS ALTHOUGH YOUR FRIEND AKBAR LIVES IN AFGHANISTAN SURROUNDED BY THOSE JERKOFFS.
(APPLAUSE) BECAUSE, TO REITERATE, HEY!
