>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
SO, THE DAY AFTER THE DEMOCRATSGOT THEIR BALLS WAXED, PRESIDENT
OBAMA ANNOUNCED THAT HE WASGOING TO TAKE ACTION WHETHER THE
NEW CONGRESS WASWITH HIM OR NOT.
>> THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID HEWILL BYPASS CONGRESS WITH AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATIONREFORM.
>> I'M EAGER TO SEE WHAT THEYHAVE TO OFFER, BUT IN THE
MEANTIME, LET'S FIGURE OUT WHATWE CAN DO LAWFULLY THROUGH
EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE THEFUNCTIONING OF THE EXISTING
SYSTEM.
WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IS JUSTWAIT.
>> Jon:  I MEAN, IT'S BEENTWO DAYS.
SHOULD I CALL THEM?
SHOULD THEY CALL ME?
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK DESPERATE,BUT I AM A LITTLE DESPERATE.
BUT IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION.
HE IS EXCITED ABOUT DOING STUFFNOW BUT WHAT WAS HE DOING BEFORE
THE ELECTION?
>> MORE CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONSDELAYED BY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION UNTIL AFTER THEELECTIONS.
>> EVERYTHING FROM THENOMINATION OF A NEW ATTORNEY
GENERAL TO DECISIONS ON THECONTROVERSIAL KEYSTONE XL
PIPELINE, IMMIGRATION REFORM,CORPORATE TAX REFORM, AND RATES
FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THATACTION WAS TAKEN AT THE REQUEST
OF SENATE DEMOCRATS.
>> THREE SENATORS, MARK PRYOR,KAY HAGAN, AND MARY LANDRIEU
ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO DELAY HISDECISION TO HAVE SOME EXECTUTIVE
ORDERS MITIGATING IMMIGRATION,DEPORTATION.
>> Jon:  SENATE DEMOCRATSWANTED TO AVOID VOTES ON
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES SO THEYWOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE UNPOPULAR
STANCE THAT MIGHT COST THEMREELECTION.
AND THEY GOT PRESIDENT TO GOALONG WITH IT.
IT'S A WELL-KNOWN POLITICALMANEUVER KNOWN AS THE
CHICKEN ( BLEEP ) GAMBIT.
IT'S NAMED, OF COURSE, FORSENATOR DICKLESS H. CHICKEN
( BLEEP ).
WHO, WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHETHERHE SUPPORTED THE EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION, FAMOUSLY SAIDWHAT?
HUH?
AND THEN HAD TO PRETEND TO BEHARD OF HEARING FOR THE REST OF
HIS LIFE.
( LAUGHTER )BUT IF YOU'RE BASING YOUR AGENDA
PURELY ON WHAT HELPS RED-STATEDEMOCRATS, HOW ABOUT THE
KEYSTONE PIPELINE?
THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS MOREPOPULAR IN RED STATES THAN
CHICK-FIL-A'S NEW PATRIOTBASKET.
WHY NOT JUST APPROVE THAT BEFORETHE ELECTION?
>> FRIDAY'S OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONDECISION TO DELAY CONSTRUCTIONG
OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE AGAINMAY TURN OUT TO BE A BOOST
FOR DEMOCRATS WHO OPPOSE THEPROJECT.
IT ALLOWS VULNERABLE DEMOCRATSFROM ENERGY-PRODUCING RED STATES
ROOM TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROMPRESIDENT OBAMA AND OPPOSE HIM.
>> Jon:  OH, COME ON.
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT SO CYNICALTHAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DELAY
ACTION ON A PROJECT JUST SOFELLOW DEMOCRATS COULD ATTACK
HIM FOR DELAYING THAT ACTION.
>> LOUISIANA SENATOR MARYLANDRIEU, DENOUNCING THE LATEST
DELAYS SAYING, "THIS DECISION ISIRRESPONSIBLE, UNNECESSARY, AND
UNACCEPTABLE."
>> ALASKA SENATOR MARK BEGICHSAYS, "I AM FRANKLY APPALLED AT
THE CONTINUED FOOT DRAGGING BYTHIS ADMINISTRATION."
>> ARKANSAS'S MARK PRYOR SAID,"THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR ANOTHER DELAY.
THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO APPROVETHIS PROJECT NOW."
>> Jon:  ADDING -- WINK.
SO LAST APRIL, SEVEN MONTHS AGO,OBAMA DELAYS HIS KEYSTONE
DECISION.
RED-STATE DEMOCRATS GET POINTSFOR ATTACKING THE PRESIDENTS,
BLUE-STATE DEMOCRATS GET POINTSFOR ATTACKING THE PIPELINE.
IT WAS A WIN-WIN.
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.
THEY ALL LOST!
PRYOR LOST.
HAGAN LOST, BEGICH LOST.
THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T LOST ISLANDRIEU.
SHE'S GOING INTO A RUN OFF,WHICH SHE'S GOING TO LOSE.
IT'S LIKE DEMOCRATS CAME UP WITHTHIS PLAN TO PRODUCE SPRINGTIME
FOR HITLER BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEYREALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD
( BLEEP ) PLAY.
AND BY THE WAY, THAT KEYSTONEPIPELINE?
YOU DELAYED THE DECISION ON THATBACK IN APRIL.
THAT'S SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THEELECTION.
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OFGOVERNING TIME.
THESE ELECTIONS ARE TWO YEARSAPART.
IF YOU TAKE OUT THE SEVEN MONTHSBEFORE THE ELECTION, WHERE
THINGS ARE GOING, AND THEN YOUGO FROM THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF
THE NEW ELECTION WHERE THE NEWGUYS WHERE UNPACKING AND
FIGURING OUT THE E-MAIL, PLUSSUMMER RECESS PLUS SPRING
RECESS, AUTUMN APPLE PICKING,THE WEEK WHEN THE SENATORS'
PARENTS COME TO VISIT, HOUSE OFREPS SADIE HAWKINS DANCE,
OBVIOUSLY ALL THE TIME SPENTFUND-RAISING, BASICALLY
THERE'S ONE DAY IN MARCH WHERE,WEATHER PERMITTING,
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET ( BLEEP )
DONE WITHOUT POLITICALLY HARMINGONE THING OR THE OTHER.
AND APPARENTLY, THIS YEAR,DEMOCRATS SPENT THAT DAY SITTING
AROUND TRYING TO MAKE THATSOUND.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )SO TO RECAP.
THE DEMOCRATS' 2014 STRATEGYINSTEAD OF DOING THINGS THAT THE
PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THEM WOULDLIKE, THEY DECIDED TO NOT DO
ANYTHING SO AS NOT TO OFFEND THEVOTERS WHO ALREADY DIDN'T LIKE
THEM.
( LAUGHTER )OR TO PUT THAT IN THE CLASSIC
WORDS OF DICKLESS H. CHICKEN ( BLEEP )?
WHAT?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
