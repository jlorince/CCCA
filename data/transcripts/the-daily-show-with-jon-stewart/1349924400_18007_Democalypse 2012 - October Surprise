WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
IN MY-- IN MY CONTINUING EFFORT TO MAKE MYSELF LOOK AS MUCH LIKE A KEEBLER ELF AS POSSIBLE, OUR GUEST TONIGHT MAGIC JOHNSON WILL
BE JOINING US.

WHAT WAS BEING PRESENTED WASN'T LEADERSHIP.
THAT'S SALESMANSHIP.
>> Jon:  RIGHT, BUT SALESMANSHIP IS THE THING YOU INVARIABLY NEED TO ACQUIRE LEADERSHIP.
( LAUGHTER ) BY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS SUGGESTED YOU NEED TO BE POLITE.
THAT YOU JUST SHOUT, YEAH, ( BLEEP ) LIAR!" PEOPLE ARE JUST SUGGESTING YOU STAND UP TO MR. ROMNEY "WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, YOU'RE A ( BLEEP )
