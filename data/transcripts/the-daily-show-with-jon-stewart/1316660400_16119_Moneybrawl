[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, DO WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, MITCH DANIELS.
HE IS THE CURRENT GOVERNOR OF
INDIANA AND THE GUY THAT EVERY
OTHER REPUBLICAN SAYS, "MAN, I
WISH THAT GUY WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT."
[LAUGHTER]
BUT AT LEAST MAYBE VICE
PRESIDENT.
BUT LET'S START IN WASHINGTON.
THEY ENJOY THAT.
MONDAY MORNING PRESIDENT OBAMA
TOOK TO THE WHITE HOUSE ROSE
GARDEN, WHERE APPEARING IN FRONT
OF THE VERY DOORKNOBS THAT MIGHT

MEDICAL RESEARCH, OR WE'VE GOT
TO REFORM THE TAX CODE SO THAT
THE MOST PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS
HAVE TO GIVE UP TAX LOOPHOLES
THAT OTHER COMPANIES DON'T GET.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO BOTH.
THIS IS NOT CLASS WARFARE.
IT'S MATH.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: LET ME SAY THIS:
BARACK OBAMA KNOWS ONE THING.
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG APPEALING
TO AMERICANS' LOVE OF MATH.
[LAUGHTER]
PROBABLY SOMETHING HE STOLE
BASED ON THE HUGELY POPULAR
ONLINE ROLE PLAYING GAME "WORLD
OF MATHCRAFT."
MY CHARACTER RHOMBUS WEARS THE
PYTHAGORAS HAT.
THAT'S HOW YOUR GOING TO SELL
YOUR PROGRAM?
IT'S NOT WAR, THE THING WE'RE
BEST AT, IT'S MATH, THE
