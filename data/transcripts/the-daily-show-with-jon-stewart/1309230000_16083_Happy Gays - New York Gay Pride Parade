OF COURSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF
LEGALIZING GAY MARRIAGE CAN BE
HARD TO FULLY UNDERSTAND
UNLESS PERHAPS YOU HAVE A
CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS IN
MUSICAL THEATER.
WE SENT OUR OWN JOSH GAD FROM
THE BOOK OF MORMON OUT TO MAKE
SENSE OF THIS LANDMARK
LEGISLATION.
>> Reporter: THE LEGALIZATION
OF GAY MARRIAGE MEANS ONE
THING.
SUPER BOWL HERO DAVID TIREE.
>> THIS WILL BE THE BEGINNING
OF OUR COUNTRY SLIDING TOWARD,
YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRONG WORD
BUT ANARCHY.
>> Reporter: NOW EVERYONE FROM
AL BANY TO ROCHESTER WILL HAVE
TO DEAL WITH WHAT PEOPLE HERE
IN THIS CITY HAVE LONG HAD TO
ACCEPT AS PART OF THEIR DAILY
LIVES.
TRAFFIC SNARLS.
SAILORS GONE AWOL.
>> IT'S LIKE AN AVERAGE DAY IN
THE GAY COMMUNITY.
ISN'T SNIT.
>> NO.
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DAY
THAT WE HAVE.
>> Reporter: SIR, MAY I ASK
YOU A QUICK QUESTION.
HOW IS THIS NOT LIKE THE
APOCALYPSE?
>> THIS IS A (BEEP) PARADE,
DUDE.
>> Reporter: IT REMINDS ME A
BIT OF THAT PASSAGE FROM
REVELATION.
I SAW A HORSE AND ITS RIDER
WAS WEARING A JOCK STRAP AND
HELL FOLLOWED.
>> I DON'T READ THE BIBLE.
>> Reporter: IT'S IN THERE,
PAGE 42.
>> WHAT KIND OF PARADE IS IN
STORE FOR TOMORROW?
>> I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER
PARADE BECAUSE WE HAVE PRIDE
ONLY ONCE A YEAR.
>> Reporter: YOU'RE SAYING
THIS IS THE PARADE BUT IN
REALITY THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY
PARADE IS A VERY ACCURATE
PORTRAYAL OF HOW IRISH PEOPLE
BEHAVE EVERYDAY.
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL.
>> Reporter: I WOULD.
>> BECAUSE SOME OF THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE OUT MAKING A MESS ON
ST. PATRICK'S AREN'T EVEN
IRISH.
>> Reporter: BUT IRISH PEOPLE
ARE ALWAYS GETTING DRUNK AND
VOMITING AND INSIDE SUBWAY
STATIONS.
TAKE A GOOD LOOK, UPSTATE.
NORMAL RESPECTABLE PEOPLE LIKE
THIS WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO
TURN.
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE
REPERCUSSIONS OF GAY MARRIAGE?
>> YEAH, I'M ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE.

LIKE YOU.

MORMON.
TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T WIN.
>> Reporter: ARE YOU FROM THE
BOOK OF MORMON?
OH, MY GOD.
>> Reporter: ALL RIGHT.
I HOPE YOU GUYS HAVE FUN
(BEEP) YOURSELVES.
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT NO ONE,
NOT EVEN THIS INTREPID
REPORTER, WAS IMMUNE FROM
THEIR TAKEOVER.
>> I THINK THAT NEW YORK IS A
PART OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
NEW YORK IS GOING TO STILL BE
NEW YORK.
JUST A PART OF EVERYTHING
ELSE.
>> Reporter: REALLY?
>> YES.
>> Reporter: THEN HOW DID THIS
HAPPEN?
THREE MINUTES AGO I WAS
WEARING A SUIT.
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I EVEN GOT
