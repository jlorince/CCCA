NOW IN THE WAKE OF THE WAKE OF
THE REVOLUTION, THE BIG
QUESTION REMAINS.
WHO CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS
UPRISE SOMETHING.
>> IT WAS A REVOLUTION THAT
REALLY STARTED ON FACEBOOK.
IT WAS SUSTAINED BY TWITTER.
AND SAVED BY GOOGLE.
>> Jon: AND OF COURSE RUINED
BY ROULETTE.
COME ON.
REALLY?
EVEN DURING A REVOLUTION.
SO IN EGYPT THEY USED SOCIAL
MEDIA TO FOMENT AND SUSTAIN A
PEACEFUL REVOLUTION.
WHEREAS HERE WE MIGHT USE IT
TO SAY DO PROMOTIONS FOR NEVER
SAY NEVER OR SEE AN OR GANG
TAN PEE INTO HIS OWN MOUTH.
BY THE WAY, WHEN IS THAT
COMING OUT IN 3-D?
IT COULDN'T ALL BE ATTRIBUTED
TO THE INTERNET.
SURELY, THERE IS A DEEPER,
MORE "I TOLD YOU SO "TYPE
CAUSE.
>> CAN YOU TAKE ANY PRIDE IN
WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE ALONG WITH
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH YOU
TALKED ABOUT FREEDOM BACK AS
EARLY AS 2004 COMING TO THE
MIDDLE EAST.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID YOU'RE
CRAZY.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
CULTURE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE
PEOPLE NOW?
>> Jon: HEY, HEY, HEY, JUST SO
WE'RE CLEAR.
PRESIDENT BUSH AND TONY BLAIR
DIDN'T INVENT FREEDOM IN THE
EARLY 2000s.
AND THEN GEORGE BUSH AND TONY
BLAIR STOLE IT FROM THEM.
OH, TWINS, WILL YOU EVER WIN?
BY THE WAY, THE ARGUMENT
AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR WASN'T
PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
CAN'T HANDLE DEMOCRACY.
IT WAS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT
APPRECIATE ITS FOURTH IMPORT.
SOME OF THE ONLY PEOPLE I SEE
WORRYING ABOUT FREEDOM IN THAT
PART OF THE WORLD WORK DOWN
THE HALL FROM YOU.
>> THE EXPERTS ARE CELEBRATING
THIS AS A VICTORY FOR FREEDOM.
MAYBE YOU GOT RID OF A
DICTATOR TODAY.
BUT WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW?
RECENT POLLS IN EGYPT SHOW
THAT 84% SAY THAT APOSTATES OR
THOSE WHO FOR SAKE ISLAM
SHOULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY.
>> GERMANY HAD DEMOCRACY AND
VOTED IN HITLER.
>> Jon: I CAN TEAR... I CAN
TAKE CARE OF THIS.
EGYPT, DURING YOUR ELECTIONS
IF THERE'S A GUY RUNNING, HE
HAS A LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND
WHENEVER HE TALKS YOU DOES
THIS (RANTING), DON'T VOTE FOR
THAT GUY.
DON'T EVEN PUT THAT GUY ON THE
BALLOT.
(BEEP) THAT GUY.
THAT WILL DO IT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE CHOSE TO
NEITHER GIVE CREDIT TO NOR
FEAR FOR AMERICA.
PLACING THE FOCUS ON, OF ALL
THINGS, EGYPT.
>> THE CREDIT DOES NOT BELONG
TO US THE UNITED STATES.
THE CREDIT BELONGS TO THOSE
YOUNG PEOPLE OUT IN THE
STREETS OF CAIRO WHO WERE SO
BRAVE.
>> Jon: THAT IS OVER THE LINE,
GERGEN.
IT WAS US.
AND THE INTERNET.
GEORGE W. BUSH AND PETS DOT-COM.
IT WAS FREEDOM FRIES AND J-DATE.
PROBABLY NOT J-DATE.
OF COURSE AS THE EUPHORIA DIES
DOWN, THOSE PEOPLE IN EGYPT
ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY WE
IN THE UNITED STATES HAD
SUPPORTED THIS REPRESSIVE
REGIME OF MUBARAK FOR ALMOST
30 YEARS NOW.
FUNNY, THERE'S A SIMPLE
EXPLANATION.
FUNNY STORY.
WE WERE TESTING YOU.
WE HAD TO KNOW IF YOU WERE
WORTHY OR IF UNDER DURESS YOU
WOULD PERHAPS GIVE AWAY OUR
FREEDOM SECRETS.
PERHAPS IT WOULD ALL MAKE
SENSE IF I SHOW YOU WHAT
YOU'VE WON.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DO YOU SEE NOW WHY WE COULDN'T
TELL YOU?
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY REALLY
LOOKS LIKE.
COME WITH ME AND YOU'LL BE IN
A WORLD OF VOTER
PARTICIPATION.
TAKE MY HAND, GO INTO THE
BOOTH AND VOTE FOR AN
ELECTORAL REPRESENTATIVE WHO
WILL REPRESENT YOUR COMMUNITY
AND ALSO THE ELECTORAL
CONGLOMERATE.
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK WITH ALL OF
IT.
SORRY ABOUT THE TEAR GAS
