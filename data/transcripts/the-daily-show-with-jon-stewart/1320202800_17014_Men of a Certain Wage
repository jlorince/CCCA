>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GIVE IT
AWAY.
WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST TONIGHT,
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY.
WE'LL... I'LL GIVE YOU A SMALL
CLUE.
HER FIRST NAME IS CONTINUE LEE
SAA.
OTHER THAN THAT IT COULD BE
ANYBODY.
CONDOLEEZZA.
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,
AMERICA'S ONGOING ECONOMIC WOES.
>> AS OUR NATION'S FINANCIAL
DIFFICULTIES CONTINUE TO BE
DEFINED, AS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN
THOSE BUSINESSES WHOSE
MONUMENTAL LOSSES WERE COVERED
BY TARP AND THOSE WHOSE RAMEN
NOODLES AND HACKKY SACKS WERE
ALSO COVERED BY TARP.
BUT THROUGH IT ALL, IT'S EASY TO
FORGET THE REAL VICTIMS OF THIS
EPIC BATTLES-- THE FEELINGS OF
THE WINNERS.
>> SINCE WHEN IN THIS COUNTRY
WAS IT OKAY TO DEMONIZE SUCCESS?
>> THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM IS
UNDER ATTACK.
>> THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS GOING
TO HAVE TO STOP BASHING THE
RICH.
>> DEMONIZING SUCCESS.
>> GOING AFTER THE RICH AND
STOKEING THE RICH BACK TO THE
OLD POPULOUS.
>> WHY VILIFY THE TOP 1%?
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAVE
ANYBODY BY VILIFYING THEM.
>> Jon: YOU PEOPLE DON'T GET IT.
WHAT PART OF MO MONEY MO
PROBLEMS DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
(LAUGHTER)
THERE IS THAT FEELING, TOO.
>> AN OP-ED COLUMNIST IN FROM
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" RECEIVED
THESE PHOTOS SNAPPED AT A
HALLOWEEN PARTY LAST YEAR.
THEY WERE ACTUAL EMPLOYEES AT
THE STEPHEN J. BALM LAW FIRM
NEAR BUFFALO, NEW YORK.
IT'S A LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS
BANKS WHEN THEY WANT TO
FORECLOSE ON SOMEONE'S HOME.
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE WORKERS ARE
DRESSED UP AS HOMELESS PEOPLE.
AND SQUATTERS.
