>> I'VE BEEN UNDER THAT DESKFOR YEAR WAITING TO CLOSE THIS.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT IWAS WONDERING.
I MEAN YEAH, THERE'S WATER,THERE'S FOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
>> John: EVERYTHING YOU NEED.
>> LET'S START WITH -->> John: GO.

BECAUSE IF IT WAS NOT FOR MYARREST, JON WOULD NOT MAKE THIS
FILM.
>> John: RIGHT.
>> YOU WOULD NOT HOST THE SHOWAND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE YOUR SHOW
NOW.>> John: YEAH.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> John: SO I GUESS WHATWE'RE SAYING IS.
>> MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD TIME.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> John: DO I OWE AHMADINEJAD10% OF MY FUTURE INCOME,
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
>> AHMADINEJAD ANDMR. ROSEWATER.
>> John: OKAY, SO THAT'S 20%.OKAY. ALRIGHT.
>> EXACTLY. YEAH.>> John: SO, LET'S TALK A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THE BACKGROUND HERE.>> SURE.
>> John: ESPECIALLY YOURBACKGROUND, BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
WAS IMPRISONED BY THE SHAH INTHE 50s.
YOUR OLDER SISTER WAS IMPRISONEDBY RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI IN THE 80s.
>> KHOMEINI.>> John: YEAH, KHOMEINI.
>> KHOMEINI, KHOMEINI THEY'RELIKE -- OKAY, YEAH.
>> John: I'M BRITISH.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HOWEVER WESAY IT.
>> EXACTLY.
>> John:  I BELIEVE THAT'SWHERE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS
STARTED BUT THAT'S A WHOLEBIGGER DISCUSSION.
SO IS THE ABILITY TO PISS OFFIRANIAN LEADERSHIP, IS THAT A
DOMINANT GENE IN YOUR FAMILY?
>> IT'S THE BAHARI FORTE, YES.BAHARI FORTE.
WELL BASICALLY, MY FAMILY WANTSA BETTER IRAN, A MORE DEMOCRATIC
IRAN.>> John: RIGHT.
>> MY GRANDFATHER WAS ALSO APOLITICAL ACTIVIST.
THEN MY FATHER WAS A POLITICALACTIVIST.
MY SISTER.
WE ALL WANT TO HAVE A BETTERIRAN.
BUT, OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENT,WHICH IS HAPPY WITH THE STATUS
QUO, THE GOVERNMENT THAT WANTSTO RAPE AND PILLAGE THE NATIONAL
RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY, DOESNOT WANT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF
CHANGE.
SO MY FATHER SUFFERED IN THE1950s.
MY SISTER SUFFERED IN THE1980s.
AND I, OF COURSE, WENT TO JAILIN 2009.
>> John: SO DID YOU WALK AWAYFROM THAT INTERVIEW THINKING
THAT WAS FUN.
THAT WAS A BIT OF HARMLESS FUN.
OR DID YOU THINK I WONDER IFTHAT CROSSED THE LINE?
>> NO, IT WAS A VERY, IT WAS AVERY INNOCENT INTERVIEW.
>> John: RIGHT.
>> AFTER COMING OUT OF THATINTERVIEW, I DID NOT THINK THAT
JON STEWART WOULD MAKE A FILMSTARRING GAEL GARCIA BERNAL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANINTERVIEW LIKE MANY OTHER
INTERVIEWS THAT I HAD DONE INTHE PAST.
AND THEY HAD A SCENARIO FOR ME.
THEY WANTED TO INCRIMINATE SOMEREFORMIST WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
OF IRAN THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE MEWHO WORKED WITH WESTERN
ORGANIZATIONS.
SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THEMEDIA CONDUIT BETWEEN THE
IRANIAN REFORMISTS AND FOREIGNINTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
>> John: RIGHT. THERE'S A POINTIN THE MOVIE WHERE THE
INTERROGATOR IS TOLD BY HISSUPERVISOR, YOU MUST NOT JUST
TAKE HIS BLOOD.
YOU MUST ALSO TAKE HIS HOPE.>> YEAH.
>> John: HOW DO YOU PROTECT THATIN THAT SITUATION?
HOW DO YOU PROTECT YOUR OWNHOPE?
>> WHEN THEY PUT YOU IN SOLITARYCONFINEMENT, THEY DEPRIVE YOU
OF ALL YOUR SENSES.
YOU CANNOT SEE ANYTHING EXCEPTFOR THE WALLS AROUND YOU.
YOU CANNOT TOUCH ANYTHING EXCEPTFOR THE WALLS AROUND YOU.
SO YOU HAVE TO GO INSIDEYOURSELF.
SOME PEOPLE ARE RELIGIOUS,SPIRITUAL.
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IRAN--MYSELF, THEY WERE RECITING THE
KORAN, BUT I'M NOT SUCH ABELIEVER SO I HAD TO FIND OTHER
THINGS.
I HAD TO GO THROUGH MY LIFEEXPERIENCE.
MY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY LOVEDONES, MY FATHER AND MY SISTER
WHO YOU SEE IN THE FILM.
MY TRAVELS, THE BOOKS THAT I HADREAD, THE MUSIC THAT I HAD
LISTENED TO, AND THE FILMSSO I HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL
THAT IN ORDER TO EMPOWER MYSELF.
BUT ALSO WHAT EMPOWERED ME WASTHAT I KNEW ONE DAY, I WOULD
COME OUT OF PRISON, AND I WOULDWRITE THAT BOOK, AND I WOULD
JUST TELL THE WORLD WHAT WASHAPPENING IN IRAN TO PEOPLE LIKE
ME, BUT ALSO WHAT IS HAPPENINGTO MANY THOUSANDS OF JOURNALISTS
AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE GOINGTHROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE
EVERY DAY ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
>> John: I HAVE TO THROW TO ABREAK.
I'M NOT USED TO DOING THAT.
NORMALLY, HBO I JUST THROW TO"GAME OF THRONES."
THIS TIME I HAVE TO THROW TO ATWIX COMMERCIAL, IT'S A MORE
DIFFICULT CHANGE OF SPEED.THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE BOOK IS "ROSEWATER."
THE MOVIE IS "ROSEWATER."
THE GREAT MAZIAR BAHARI.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GAELGARCIA BERNAL.
