>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE WAS THE
FIRST FEMALE SPEAKER OF HOUSE
AND NOW THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC
LEADER.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER
NANCY PELOSI.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS FOR JOINING US AGAIN.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
YOU KNOW, CONGRESS OH, FOR
GOODNESS SAKES.
THEY ARE SO SWEET.
THEIR APPROVAL RATING RIGHT NOW
IS SLIGHTLY BELOW, FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND HEPATITIS C.
>> AND YOU WONDER WHO ARE THESE
PEOPLE WHO APPROVE OF CONGRESS,
THE 9%?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT
IS?
>> LET ME -- LAST TIME I WAS
HERE IN APRIL OF 2009 -- THAT
WAS THE LAST TIME I WAS ON THE
SHOW, DEMOCRATS WERE IN CONTROL
CONGRESSIONAL RATING WAS 40%.
40%, YOU REMEMBER THAT?
NOTE TO SELF.
>> Jon: NOT ONLY DO I NOT
REMEMBER THAT.
THE WHOLE 2009 THING YOU
MENTIONED THAT WENT PAST ME AS
WELL.
>> WE HAVE WORK TO DO.
>>.
>> Jon: IT FEELS LIKE THEY
TAKE GOOD INTENTIONS.
IT'S WHERE GOOD INTENTIONS GO TO
DIE.
>> NO.
WELL, NOT WHEN WE WERE IN THE
MAJORITY.
WE TOOK THEM TO A PLACE TO MAKE
SURVIVAL TO SUCCESS.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES.
LOOK AT ME PELOSI.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S WE'LL USE THE EXAMPLE OF
THIS VOCAL RULE.
SO THE IDEA IS BANKS ARE USING
MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS TO FINANCE
THEIR SORT OF SPECULATIVE HEDGE
FUND ACTIVITIES, BUYING RISKY
DEBT AND ALL THAT.
SO PAUL VOLCKER WRITES A MEMO TO
THE PRESIDENT SAYS, WE SHOULD
STOP THAT.
AND THEN CONGRESS GETS IT AND
THEY SAY WE SHOULD.
THAT THREE-PAGE MEMO TURNS INTO
A 300-PAGE BILL THE SUMMARY OF
WHICH IS 41 PAGES TO THE POINT
WHERE PAUL VOLCKER SAYS, UH, I
DON'T LIKE THIS ANYMORE.
IS THAT WHY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
ZMONG BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS
THE SIMPLE CLEAR RULE THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN EASILY REGULATED IS
ATTACKED BY LOBBYISTS, BANKERS,
SPECIAL INTERESTS AND TURNED
INTO OATMEAL.
>> WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY OF
LOOKING AT IT.
THE FACT IS THE VOLCKER RULE IS
A VERY GOOD IDEA AS ORIGINALLY
PROPOSED AND HOW THAT TRANSLATES
TO LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE.
THAT SAY RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE.
IT HAS TO TURN INTO
LEGISLATIVE -- IT DIDN'T ADD
PROVISIONS IT TRANSLATED.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS SO
INSIDER WHAT IS IMPORTANT.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT YOU CALL
INSIDER WE CALL THE BUSINESS OF
CONGRESS.
IT'S NOT JUST PUTTING IT IN
LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE IT'S PEOPLE
FINDING WHAT THEY CALL
EXCEPTIONS, WHAT WE WOULD CALL
LOOPHOLES.
YOU HOW DOES THAT GET IN THERE
TO CHANGE WHAT IS A PRETTY CLEAN
RULE?
>> EVEN PAUL VOLCKER AS HE SAYS
IN TERMS OF HOW YOU RIGHT THE
RULE AND WHAT THE RESULT WILL BE
HAS A PERIOD OF PUBLIC COMMENT.
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
PEOPLE HAVE MADE SUGGESTIONS TO
SAY THERE MAY BE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCE.
WHY I SAY IT'S INSIDER, THE FACT
IS WHAT THE END PRODUCTS THAT BE
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT
HAPPENS BY SOME -- NOT TO PAINT
EVERYONE WITH THE SAME BRUSH, BY
SOME ON WALL STREET, THE
RECKLESSNESS CAUSES JOBLESSNESS
ON MAIN STREET.
WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS NOT
RIGHT AND THAT IS THE
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.
>> Jon: I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND.
MY POINT IS BY ADDING THE
EXEMPTIONS BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT
HAS MUDDLED THE PURPOSE OF RULE
TO THE POINT WHERE HE THINKS
IT'S NO LONGER QUITE EFFECTIVE
AND MAKES IT HARDER TO REGULATE,
HARDER TO ENFORCE.
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE HIM
ON THE SHOW BECAUSE HE WOULD
EXPLAIN TO YOUjF VERY CLEARLY WHY
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY IT IS
EMERGING BUT NOT WHAT HIS
ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS AND HOW
CONGRESS WROTE THE BILL.
>> Jon: HE FEELS THERE'S
LOOPHOLES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT
TO RECOGNIZE.
HE FEELS NOW IT'S THAT OBSCENITY
RULE I'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE BUT
IT'S NOT AS CLEAR.
IT'S BEEN WATERED DOWN.
IT SEEMS LIKE -- I MEAN, WOULD
YOU -- LET'S BACK IT UP FOR A
SECOND WOULD YOU SAY IT'S A
VALID CRITICISM OF CONGRESS THAT
LOBBYISTS THROUGH THE POWER THAT
THEY EXERT ON LEGISLATORS OFTEN
TAKE CLEAR CUT LEGISLATION AND
MUDDLE IT TO THE POINT WHERE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMPOSE.
>> LET'S INLARGE THE ISSUE FROM
THERE.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO BE
UNFAIR TO CONGRESS.
THEY ARE AT 9%.
YOU DON'T WANT TO KICK SOMEONE
WHEN THEY ARE DONE.
>> WE WERE AT 40 WHEN I WAS
THERE LAST EAR TIME.
>> Jon: THAT WAS A SOLID D.
>> WE WERE THINKING HOW CAN WE
GET MORE?
AS YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW
AT THE SUPERCOMMITTEE.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THERE'S A PROCESS.
WE DID NOT HAVE THE 60 VOTES IN
THE SENATE.
WE COULD NOT WRITE EVERYTHING
CLEARLY THE WAY WE MIGHT HAVE IF
WE HAVE THE 60 VOTES.
YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE.
>> Jon: YOU SAID THE
SUPERCOMMITTEE.
AS AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER WHO
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT
VEALY GOING AND CAN'T CALL PAUL
VOLCKER.
WE HAD SIMPSON BOWLES AND
ANOTHER PROCESS AND THE GAPING
OF SIX.
NOW THEY TELL US THE
SUPERCOMMITTEE IS GOING TO DO
THAT.
IT SEEMS LIKE AGAIN, LIKE, I
DON'T KNOW AT WHAT POINT DO WE
DEMAND -- YOU LEAD THE PARTY
THAT BELIEVES GOVERNMENT CAN
TAKE EFFECTIVE FORCEFUL ACTION
TO CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES.
AT WHAT POINT DO THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE TO PROVE THAT, PROVE THAT
GOVERNMENT CAN BE AGILE AND
EFFECTIVE?
>> WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE
GOVERNMENT.
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE HAVE TWO
PATHS.
BLESS THEIR HEARTS SHALL THE
REPUBLICANS, THEY DO WHAT THEY
BELIEVE.
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN SOCIAL
SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID,
CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, PUBLIC
LEGISLATION --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THERE ARE SOME.
>> Jon: THEY WOULD SOMEWHAT
DISAGREE WITH THAT
CHARACTERIZATION.
>> MAYBE SOME OF THEM WOULD.
BUT I'M NOT PAINTING THEM WITH
ALL WITH THE SAME BRUSH.
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM
WILL USE THE DEBT THAT WE ALL
WANT TO REDUCE THE DEBT.
IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN WE
HAVE.
QUITE FRANKLY IF THEY CARED
ABOUT THE DEBT THEY WOULD HAVE
SQUAWKED WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH WAS
AMASSING IT.
>> Jon: NO QUESTION THERE.
>> SOME OF THEM WILL TRY TO USE
THE DEBT AS AN EXCUSE TO
ELIMINATE THE PUBLIC SPACE, ALL
THE THINGS I JUST TALKED B. WHAT
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- WHAT IS
THE POINT.
THE POINT IS NOW TO SAY TO THE
12 PEOPLE ON SUPERCOMMITTEE GET
IN A ROOM, SIT DOWN, REACH
AGREEMENT ON PUBLIC TELEVISION.
LET'S HAVE THIS TRANSPARENCY AND
OPEN MEETING WHERE WE SEE
EVERYBODY'S PROPOSALS AND
SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE, AN
EXPLANATION OF THEM, WHAT THEY
WOULD MEAN, TO NOT THAT TABLE
BUT THE KITCHEN TABLE OF ALL OF
AMERICA'S FAMILIES.
>> Jon: THANK.
THIS IS WHERE IT'SÃºIb DIFFICULT.
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WERE IN
CHARGE.
THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT
FORTH A BUDGET.
AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT.
THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE SHOT.
RIGHT BEFORE THE DEBT CEILING.
REMEMBER HOW RIGHT BEFORE IN THE
SESSION THEY COULD HAVE PUT
FORTH A BUDGET THE SPECIFIC
BUDGET LIKE THE ONE THEY PUT
FORTH THAT TRIGGERED THE
GEPHART, DEBT CEILING RULE.
>> THE REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE
FILIBUSTERED.
LET'S GO TO THAT PLACE.
THAT WAS A TIME.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT WE
SHOULD DO.
CAN WE -- LET'S TAKE A
COMMERCIAL BECAUSE I THINK WE
HAVE A BEER TO SELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK.
YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME
BECAUSE, AGAIN, I'M PURELY AS AN
OUTSIDE OBSERVER IT SEEMED
FACATA TO ME AND THAT'S JEWISH
