BACK THEN.
HOW DID DETROIT GET INTO THIS
MESS?
MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE?
>> SNYDER'S EMERGENCY CITY
MANAGER IS TO BLAME.
>> CORRUPTION RUN RAMPANT UNDER
THE MAYOR.
>> LEFTIST DEMOCRATS.
THE DOWNFALL OF THE AUTO
INDUSTRY.
VERY POOR TAX COLLECTION.
>> GLOBALIZATION AND
TECHNOLOGICALLED ADVANCES, LOSS
OF JOBS.
>> John: SO IT APPEARS THAT
WE'VE NARROWED DOWN THE BLAME TO
EVERYBODY.
YOU KILLED DETROIT.
YOU KILLED DETROIT.
YOU KILLED DETROIT.
EVERYBODY KILLED DETROIT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW NOBODY GETS A CAR.
WELL, ACTUALLY YOU DO BUT IT'S A
MORE AFFORDABLE CAR IMPORTED
FROM COUNTRIES LIKE.
♪ JAPAN ♪♪
AND.
♪ KOREA ♪♪
WHERE THE CARS ARE CHEAPER
BECAUSE THE PRICES AREN'T PUSHED
UP BY THINGS LIKE.
♪ HIGHER LABOR COSTS ♪♪
LOOK, THESE MUSICALS ARE CATCHY.
THAT'S A FACT.
I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.
FOLKS, IF EVERYONE CREATED THIS
MESS, WHO ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO
PAY THE PRICE FOR IT?
WILL IT BE, A, VULNERABLE
WORKING CLASS RETIREES.
OR WILL IT BE, B, IT'S A.
>> WORKERS ARE BRACING FOR WHAT
COULD HAPPEN TO THEIR PENSIONS
AND HEALTH CARE.
>> THE REAL VICTIMS ARE GOING TO
BE PEOPLE WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY
GOING TO SEE THEIR CONTRACTS
WITH DETROIT BROKEN.
PENSIONERS, PUBLIC SECTOR
WORKERS.
FOLKS IN UNIONS.
>> I GET IT.
SO DETROIT'S AUTO INDUSTRY WAS
TOO BIG TO FAIL BUT DETROIT'S
PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS ARE JUST
SMALL ENOUGH NOT TO GIVE A
[BLEEP] ABOUT IT.
HERE IS HOW CRAZY THIS STORY IS
IS.
WE ALL DETROIT TO EMERGE FROM
BANKRUPTCY OKAY, BUT WE MIGHT
NOT WANT IT TO EMERGE TOO OKAY.
AND HERE IS WHY.
>> THEY ARE REALLY IN DIRE
STRAITS.
THEY CANNOT PAY THEIR BILLS.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER
CITIES AND UP TOES AND
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
WHERE WE HAVE UNFUNDED PENSIONS
AND LIABILITIES AND HEALTH CARE
COSTS.
AND THEY ARE WATCHING VERY
CLOSELY TO SEE HOW THIS IS
TREATED IN COURT SO IT'S REALLY
A TEST CASE.
YES, WE COULD SEE MORE OF THIS.
>> John: OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT.
SO IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, DETROIT
WILL DIE AND IF IT DOES WORK,
OTHER CITIES MAY TRY GOING INTO
BANKRUPTCY TO SCREW OVER THEIR
RETIREES.
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.
GLOAT BALTIMORE AND LOS
ANGELES ♪♪
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR LIKING THAT
SONG.
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND HOW
BANKRUPTCY WORKS.
EVEN IF DETROIT DOES COME BACK,
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE
ITS CREDITORS GO FULL HARD-CORE
PORN ON THE PLACE.
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY
HAVING TO SELL CITY ASSETS
INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT IN DETROIT, INCLUDING A
PARK, INCLUDING THE VERY
VALUABLE TREASURES AT THE
DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART.
IS THAT ALL THAT ON THE TABLE.
>> I SAID AT THE BEGINNING
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.
>> John: EVERYTHING'S ON THE
TABLE.
EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE.
YOU WANT A HOCKEY TEAM, THE RED
WINGS ARE YOURS.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
CONSIDER THE DETROIT ZOO.
YOUR PERSONAL MEAT LOCKER.
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A HAND JOB?
BECAUSE FOR $10 WE'LL GIVE YOU
THE GREATEST HAND JOB OF YOUR
LIFE.
THAT'S A HUGE HAND JOB.
THAT IS INSULT TO SIGNIFICANT
ECONOMIC INJURY.
NOW ONE PARTICULAR DETROIT
TREASURE MAY GET THE MOST
ATTENTION.
>> HOWDY DOODY COULD BE THE
MOTOR CITY'S SAVIOR.
THE ORIGINAL MARIONETTE USED IN
THE 1950'S TV SHOW IS PART OF AN
ART COLLECTION THAT'S ESTIMATED
TO BE WORTH A BILLION DOLLARS OR
EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
>> John: NOT HOWDY DOODY.
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE
ALL SEEN THIS COMING.
THERE WAS THAT ONE EPISODE YEARS
AGO THAT DOES NOW SEEM ODDLY
PRESCIENT.
>> HI, KIDS.
ENJOY THE CITY WHILE YOU CAN
BECAUSE IN 50 YEARS, THANKS TO
POOR URBAN PLANNING, CORRUPT
MANAGEMENT AND THE NATURAL
FORCES OF CAPITALISM, THIS CITY
WILL BE REDUCED TO A BANKRUPT
CITY.
>> John: INTERESTING SIDE NOTE
THERE.
THOSE CHILDREN ARE NOW 75, AND
THE CITY IS WAVING HOWDY DOODY
TO THEIR PENSION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
