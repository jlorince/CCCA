NOT SURE IT'S THE OPTION FOR THE RETURN TO LIB BER TISM SOMEBODY HAS TO SHOW THE LIB RANLZ
PROGRESSIVE WHAT'S REAL FREEDOM LOOKS LIKE.
ANY TAKER?

THEY CAN PURSUE HAPPY YNS.
>> Jon: YOU SIR, THERE IN THE BEAUTIFUL JACKET WITH MATCHING HINTS OF EMOTIONAL FRAGILITY,
THAT'S GLENN BECK, THE GUY WHO LOVES FREEDOM TOO MUCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A TV SHOW ANYMORE.
HE LIVES ON THE INTERNET WHERE LAWS HAVE NO MEANINGS AND CATS CAN HAVE CHEESEBURGERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF ONLY SOMEONE LIKE GLENN BECK WOULD BUILD ONE OF THESE FREEDOM TOWNS.

[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOT TO RAIN --
