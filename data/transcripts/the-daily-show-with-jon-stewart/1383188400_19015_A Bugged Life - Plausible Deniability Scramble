SO POST NSA REVELATION, THEHOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
HAULED IN OUR NATION'S SPYCHIEFS YESTERDAY.
WHO CAME BEFORE THECONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE HAT
IN HAND.
>> THIS IS A TOUGH TIME FORNSA WHERE EVERYBODY SAYS
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OR WHYARE YOU DOING.
IT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANTFOR THIS COUNTRY THAT WE
DEFEND THIS NATION AND TAKETHE BEATING THAN IT IS TO
GIVE UP A PROGRAM THAT WOULDRESULT IN THIS NATION BEING
ATTACKED.
>> I'M SORRY, DID I SAY THEYCAME HAT IN HAND.
I MEANT MIDDLE FINGERS ABLAZING.
YES, THE INTELLIGENCECOMMUNITY'S ATTTUDE COULD
BEST BE DESCRIBED AS ARE WEDONE HERE?
BECAUSE I NEED TO GET BACKON THAT WALL.
YOU NEED ME ON THAT WALL.
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.
SHOW ME THE MONEY.
YOU HAD ME AT HELLO.
WE AIN'T TEACHING RADIO,RADIO TEACHING US.
THAT'S NOT A NOISE, THIS ISA NOISE, I'M NOT A STRIPPER,
I'M A DANCER.
SAID THE DIRECTOR OF THENATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY.
BUT THE CONGRESS PEOPLE INTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE WERE ADAMANT THEYDID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
HOW WE GATHER INTELLIGENCE.
>> I THINK THAT IF YOU ARETAPPING THE PHONE LINE OF A
FOREIGN LEADER, AND ALLYTHAT IS A SIGNIFICANT
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY THATSHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE
COMMITTEE.
>> I TOO WANT TO JUST SAYTHAT WE NEED TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TOINSURE THAT OUR MEMBERS
GET THE INFORMATION THAT WENEED.
>> WHY DID WE NOT KNOW THATHEADS OF STATES WERE BEING
EAVES DROPPED ON, SPIED ON.
>> I THOUGHT WE WERE BROS.
THESE FOLKS IN CONGRESS ONTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE ARE COMPLETELYTAKEN OFF GUARD BUT
WHAT-- MAYBE THE EXCESSES OFAMERICAN INTELLIGENCE
GATHERING AND THEY HAVE EVERYRIGHT TO BE OUTRAGED AND
SURPRISED.
WELL, NOT EVERY RIGHT, NORIGHT, THEY HAVE NO RIGHT.
HERE'S WHY.
>> IN 2001 CONGRESS PASSEDTHE PATRIOT ACT GIVING OUR
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ACCESSTO QUOTE ANY TANGIBLE THING.
THAT'S THE PHRASE THAT'S INTHE PATRIOT ACT.
OUR NATION'S INTELLIGENCEHAS TO HAVE ACCESS TO
EVERYTHING EXCEPTWISHES AND FAIRIES.
AND THAT ACT WAS RENEWEDTWICE BY CONGRESS.
IN 2007 CONGRESS PASSED THEPROTECT AMERICA ACT.
GIVING THOSE SAME AGENCIESBLANKET
SURVEILLANCE POWERS WITHOUTEVEN HAVING TO NAME SPECIFIC
TARGETS.
IN 2008 AND 2012 EXPANDEDAND EXTENDED POWERS,
EXPLICITLY REJECTED ANAMENDMENT OF A DISCLOSURE OF
THE SURVEILLANCE.
SO THE LEGISLATUREBEWILDERED AT THE SCOPE AND
REACH OF THE SURVEILLANCEGRANTED THEM THE SCOPE AND
REACH.
IF I MAY, I CAN'T BELIEVEYOU STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT AND
GOT DRUNK JUST BECAUSE ILEFT YOU WITH A KEG OF BEER
AND A NOTE THAT SAID DOWHATEVER THE [BLEEP] YOU
WANT FOR AS LONG AS YOUWANT.
I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
WITH THIS INCREDIBLY PERMISSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
THEY COULD SURVEIL THEENTIRE WORLD.
ALL THEY WOULD NEED ISUNLIMITED MONEY AND MANPOWER
WHICH CONGRESS ALSO GAVETHEM.
>> WE SPEND MORE ONINTELLIGENCE BY SOME
ESTIMATES THAN THE REST OFTHE WORLD PUT TOGETHER.
>> THERE ARE NOW 3200GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND
PRIVATE FIRMS WORKING ONHOMELAND SECURITY.
COUNTER TERRORISM ANDINTELLIGENCE.
854,000 PEOPLE HOLD TOPSECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES.
>> 10,000 LOCATIONS IN THEUNITED STATES WHERE
GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATECONTRACTORS ARE WORKING ON
INTELLIGENCE.
>> A MASSIVE NSA UTAH DATAFACILITY WHICH CAN HOLD FIVE
ZETABYTES OF DATA.
>> Jon: WHAT!
THAT THING CAN HOLD SO MUCHDATA THEY JUST MADE UP A
WORD FOR HOW THE DATA CANBE.
A ZETABYTE.
THAT'S NOT EVEN-- WHAT'S THELAST LETTER OF THE ALPHABET,
Z, ZETABYTE IS THERE ANYBODYON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE WHO WILL TAKE SOMERESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.
>> I JUST WANT TO CLARIFYTHE RECORD ON THIS, THAT
THIS COMMITTEE IS BRIEFED ONTHE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
PRIORITY FRAMEWORK.
ALL OF THE PRODUCTS OF THEINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OF
WHICH WE ARE CONSUMERS AREAVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE.
SOURCES AND METHODS, UNLIKEANY OTHER COMMITTEE HERE IN
THIS CONGRESS, ARE AVAILABLETO THIS COMMITTEE.
IT IS DISINGENUOUS TO IMPLYTHAT THIS COMMITTEE DID NOT
HAVE A FULL AND COMPLETEUNDERSTANDING OF ACTIVITIES
OF THE INTELLIGENCECOMMUNITY.
>> Jon: HERE HERE, COMMITTEECHAIR MR. ROGERS, REALLY,
YOU'RE MR. ROGERS?
WELL, WON'T YOU SPY ON MYNEIGHBOR.
FINALLY, A HERO EMERGES.
SOMEONE WHO IS WILLINGTO STAND UP AND SAY LOOK, WE
MADE THIS FRANKENSTEINMONSTER AND IT IS
OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REINHIM IN AND CONTROL HIM, OR
PERHAPS HE'LL GO THE OTHERWAY AND SUGGEST YES, WE KNOW
ABOUT IT AND IT'S ALL GOOD.
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT MAYBETHE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD
ANY COMPLAINTS COME FORWARDWITH ANY SPECIFICITY,
ARGUING THAT THEIR PRIVACYHAS BEEN VIOLATED CLEARLY
INDICATES IN TEN YEARS,CLEARLY INDICATES THAT
SOMETHING MUST BE DOINGRIGHT, SOMEBODY MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING EXACTLYRIGHT.
>> Jon: YES, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSEINTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S
AIRTIGHT LOGIC FOR WHY THISCAN'T A BIG DEAL, BECAUSE
FOR TEN YEARS NO ONESPECIFICALLY COMPLAINED THAT
THEY WERE BEING SURVEILEDWITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE.
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE YOURPRIVACY VIOLATED IF YOU
DON'T KNOW YOUR PRIVACY ISVIOLATED, RIGHT?
>> Jon: OF COURSE YOU CAN'THAVE YOUR PRIVACY VIOLATED
IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOURPRIVACY IS BEING-- SPYING IS
LIKE HEALTH CARE.
IF YOU NEVER FIND THAT TUMORIN YOUR YOUR BALL SAC,
IT CAN'T KILL YOU!
IT'S LIKE BENJAMIN FRANKLINSAID.
THOSE WHO WOULD TRADELIBERTY FOR SECURITY SHOULD
NEVER FIND OUT THAT THATDECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE
FOR THEM.
