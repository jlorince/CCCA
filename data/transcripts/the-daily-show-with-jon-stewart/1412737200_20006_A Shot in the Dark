[ APPLAUSE ]>> WELCOME BACK.
RECENTLY MANY AMERICAN POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE FACED
CRITICISM FOR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE.
HERE WITH MORE IS SENIOR MY WIFECORRESPONDENT, SAMANTHA B.
>> THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH,JASON.
IT IS A NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT.
A DISGUSTED PUBLIC HAS POURED INTO THE STREETS DEMANDING
CHANGE FROM THE HIDEOUS STATUS QUO.
AND YET STILL, THESETESTOSTERONE FUELED OAFS WHO
HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES UNFIT FORTHEIR JOBS ARE KEPT ON AND
EVEN PROMOTEED TO POSITIONS WHERE THEY CAN DO EVEN MORE
HARM.
>> WE'RE, WE'RE STILL TALKINGABOUT POLICE HERE, RIGHT?
>> POLICE? OH MY GOD, NO. NO,I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU,
YOU (BLEEP) ASSHOLE. SITTING INTHIS SEAT. THIS.
>> WE AGREED ON THIS. WE AGREED-- I WOULD DO ACT ONE, YOU WOULD
DO ACT TWO. WE, YOU KNOW, WOULDMAYBE FLIP FOR THE INTERVIEW.
>> YEAH, I SHOULD BE IN THATCHAIR RIGHT NOW.
>> OKAY. WAIT, WAIT. HOLD ON.[APPLAUSE]
THAT'S FINE, BUT CAN WE JUSTSHOW A LITTLE PICTURE OF HOW
SAM LOOKED WHEN, YOU KNOW, WEHEARD THAT ONE OF US WOULD HAVE
TO HOST? YEAH, RIGHT THERE.
>> OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS?>> WHAT?
>> THAT WAS JOY VOMIT. I WASGOING TO GRAB THE BRASS RING
TODAY. ANYWAY, WHATEVER,WHATEVER, WHATEVER
BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE IN THAT CHAIR REMOLDING JON'S ASS
GROOVE, I WAS OUT DOING SOME REAL REPORTING ON POLICE
SHOOTINGS.
ROLL THE PIECE.
>> I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY THATLINE.
>> YEAH. (BLEEP) YOU.
ROLL THE PIECE.
>> THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONLATELY ABOUT THE USE OF LETHAL
FORCE BY OUR NATION'S LAWENFORCEMENT.
BUT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, ONE THING ALL AMERICANS NEED TO DO
IS LOOK AT THE DATA.
>> ONE OF THE VITAL PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO
HAVE IS HOW OFTEN THE GOVERNMENT KILLS PEOPLE.
>> CRIMINOLOGIST AND AUTHOR, DAVID KLINGER.
FIRST OF ALL, ARE SHOOTINGSOF CIVILIANS BY THE POLICE,
INCREASING OR DECREASING?
>> IT'S TOO HARD TO KNOW.
>> OKAY, IT'S NOT THAT HARD.INCREASING MEANS IT'S GOING UP,
AND DECREASING MEANS GOING DOWN.
>> WE HAVE NO IDEA.
>> OKAY.
THAT'S PROBABLY A MISTAKE.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF ADATABASE.
>> THE FEDERALBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION HAS A
COUNT THAT THEY PUTOUT EVERY YEAR.
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED THE UNIFORM CRIME REPORT, BUT IT'S
SO FAR OFF, THAT IT REALLY ISN'TUSABLE.
>> HOW OFF WOULD YOU SAY THE NUMBERS ARE?
>> SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
WILDLY INACCURATE TOASTRONOMICALLY INACCURATE.
>> THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. POLICEKEEPS STATS ON EVERYTHING.
WAIT, SO BACK IT UP FOR AMINUTE.
HOW MANY BICYCLES ARE STOLEN EVERY YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY?
>> TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SOMETHOUSAND.
>> HOW MANY HOME BURGLARIES ARETHERE?
>> 800,000 OR SO.
>> DO POLICE KEEP RECORDS OF HOWMANY BULLETS ARE DISCHARGED ON A
MONTHLY BASIS?
>> ALL MAJOR POLICE DEPARTMENTSTO TRACK THAT, YES MA'AM.
>> OKAY, DO THE POLICE KEEPA RECORD OF HOW MANY BULLETS ARE
DISCHARGED IN THE DIRECTION OF CIVILIANS?
>> YES.
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SHOT BY COPS ANNUALLY?
>> NO IDEA.
>> OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST (BLEEP)WITH ME.
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU WANTSTATS ON POLICE SHOOTINGS, THEN
YOU'VE GOT TO ASK A COP.
AND WHO BETTER THAN FORMER NYPDCOMMISSIONER BERNIE KERIK.
>> IF YOU LOOKED AT THE OVERALLDATA, I WOULD SAY THAT
POLICE SHOOTINGS HAVE, THEY'VEPROBABLY DECREASED.
>> WHERE CAN I FIND THATDATABASE?
>> WELL IF YOU GO IN THENEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT.
THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE NUMBERS.
>> BUT WHAT ABOUT NATIONALLY?
>> POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE MANDATED BY LAW TO PRODUCE
THIS MATERIAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
>> HE WAS RIGHT.
THE DOJ WAS ORDERED TO KEEP ARECORD OF POLICE SHOOTINGS BACK
IN 1994 THANKS TO A LAW PASSEDBY OUR METICULOUS CONGRESS.
>> BUT IT WAS NOT CAREFULLY CRAFTED.
THERE'S NO STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT REQUIRES ANY LOCAL POLICE
AGENCY OR ANY STATE POLICE AGENCY TO REPORT ANYTHING.
>> SO BASICALLY IT'SSOMETHING LIKE THIS.
HEY GUYS, IT'S SHELLY FROM THEUNIFORM CRIME REPORT.
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD SEND ME THE STATS AND LIKE
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERESHOT DEAD OR WHATEVER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IF YOU'VE GOTTIME.
OKAY? CATCH YOU LATER.
>> THAT'S NOT A TERRIBLEAPPROXIMATION.
>> THANK YOU.
HERE'S THE THING, NOBODY ISREQUIREED TO COMPLY
WITH THE LAW THAT YOU'RESPEAKING OF.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M CONFIDENT IT GOES SOMEWHERE IN
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
>> WELL THAT DATA GOESSOMEWHERE.
IT GOES LIKE THIS.POOF!
AND THEN IT JUST DISPERSES INTO THE WIND.
IT'S ONE SIMPLE STATISTIC.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF FAMOUS STATISTICIAN.
OH, MY GOD. OH MY GOD. NATESILVER.
THANK GOD.
OKAY, YOU'RE A STATISTICS DORK.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SHOT ANDKILLED LAST YEAR BY THE POLICE?
>> I DON'T, THOSE STATISTICSJUST DON'T EXIST.
>> AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A DORK?
>> I WOULDN'T USE THAT TERM.
>> OKAY, WELL, I WOULD.
DORK.
MAYBE IT WAS TIME I GOT THE FBI TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
AND I KNEW JUST HOW TO GET THEIR ATTENTION.
OH, THEY'RE ALREADY HERE.
BUYS, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
OH, MY GOD.
AHHH. I JUST WANTTO KNOW HOW MANY
POLICE SHOOTINGS THERE ARE --OW, OW, YOU STEPPED ON MY BOOB!
>> IT WAS TIME TO TURN MY MOST TRUSTED ADVISER.
>> YOU WILL MEET A SMALL, MALEDORK.
>> UGH, I'VE ALREADY TALKED TONATE SILVER. GOD!
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
THE NATIONAL SHERIFFS' ASSOCIATION.
THE GAO.
THE CDC.WIKIPEDIA.
IMDB, GRINDR.
BUT JUST WHEN I WAS ABOUT TOGIVE UP, I DISCOVERED A
REPORTER WHOSE WEBSITEWAS CROWDSOURCING A NATIONAL
DATABASE OF POLICE SHOOTINGS.FINALLY!
>> WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED BY
POLICE.
>> OH MY GOD, WHY AM I EVENHERE?
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THREEDIFFERENT HANKS FROM
BREAKING BAD DIDN'T HAVE THENATIONAL STATISTICS?
AND THIS GUY HAD ONLY COUNTED UP TO NEVADA.
>> 8.7% OF TOTAL HOMICIDES IN NEVADA ARE COMMITTED BY
POLICE.
>> SO WHAT DOES THE NEVADA POLICE SAY WHEN YOU TOLD THEM
THIS?
>> NOTHING.
>> WHAT POSSIBLE REASONS COULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO
HIDE THE NUMBER OF TIMETHEY'VE KILLED  CITIZENS?
I JUST ANSWERED THAT QUESTION IN MY HEAD AS IT WAS COMING OUT
OF MY MOUTH.
NEVER MIND.
YOU KNOW, NO MOM WANTS TO THINKTHEIR CHILD WILL GROW UP TO
BECOME JUST ANOTHER STATISTIC.
THANKFULLY GIVEN THE CURRENTSTATE OF OUR LAWS THERE'S
NO CHANCE OF THATEVER HAPPENING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAMANTHA.THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YES, EXCELLENT REPORT. YOU DID AGREAT JOB.
[ APPLAUSE ]YES, YOU ARE A WONDERFUL WOMAN.
>> IT WAS AN EXCELLENT REPORT,BUT YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO
LOSE IT.>> THANK YOU. YEAH, YEAH.
I'M NOT LOSING ANYTHING. I'MCHAINED TO THE (BLEEP) DESK.
>> OKAY.>> I'M HERE TO THE BITTER END.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
