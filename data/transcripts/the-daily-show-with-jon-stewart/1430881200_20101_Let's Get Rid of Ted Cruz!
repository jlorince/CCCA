>> Jon: I JUST REALIZED, I JUSTREALIZED THIS JUST NOW
FROM THE FIRST ACT, THEREARE SO MANY HOPEFULS IN
THE REPUBLICAN RACE.
WE'VE GOT TO START NARROWING THEFIELD, SOME KIND OF METHOD OF
SEARCHING FOR DISQUALIFYINGTRENDS OR BEHAVIORS.
LET'S DO IT WITH A GAME I CALL"LET'S GET RID OF TED CRUZ."
THAT'S UH -- TED CRUZ.
HE'LL BE THE GUY. (APPLAUSE)
BUT HERE'S WHY -- THIS HASBEEN VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT,
WE'RE GETTING RID OF TEDCRUZ BECAUSE TED CRUZ
CANNOT LIVE UP TO THE EXTREMELYHIGH STANDARDS SET FOR A
CANDIDATE BY -- TED CRUZ.(LAUGHTER)
FOR INSTANCE -->> IT IS SCANDALOUS THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS MORE TIME TO BEFUNDRAISER IN CHIEF THAN HE DOES
TO DO HIS BASIC JOB ASCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
>> Jon: BUT UNLIKE OBAMA, TEDCRUZ DIDN'T COME TO WASHINGTON
TO FUNDRAISE, HE CAME TO GOVERNACCORDING TO HIS PRINCIPLES,
LIKE KEEPING ANY AND EVERYCONSTITUTION HATER OUT OF
OFFICE.
>> MY VOTE FOR LORETTA LYNCHIS GOING TO BE UNAMBIGUOUSLY NO.
>> Jon: SORRY OBAMA NOMINEEFOR ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA
LYNCH, YOUR CONFIRMATION NOTHAPPENING!
BECAUSE TED CRUZ IS FIGHTING FORAMERICA BECAUSE WHEN TED CRUZ
IS FIGHTING FOR AMERICA, HEWON'T REST.
>> THE SENATE HAS CONFIRMEDLORETTA LYNCH AS THE NEXT
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
THE AFTERNOON'S VOTE WAS 56 TO43.
TED CRUZ WAS THE ONLY SENATORNOT TO VOTE --
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT'S WEIRD.
HOW DID TED CRUZ'S UNAMBIGUOUSLY"NO" VOTE TURN INTO
UNAMBIGUOUSLY NO VOTE?
>> THE REASON IS BECAUSE HE WASON HIS WAY TO HOUSTON FOR A
MAJOR FUNDRAISER FOR HISPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)>> Jon: I THINK THEY SEE HOW
DISAPPOINTED TED CRUZ WILL BE INYOU.
YOU.
(LAUGHTER)SO A SLIGHT DISCONNECT ON THE
FUNDRAISING TIP.
BUT ON TO THE NEXT ROUND OFOUR GAME, ONCE AGAIN
WE'LL START WITH SOME STRONG TEDCRUZ CRITICISM.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS MADEDECISIONS THAT I THINK HAVE
INFLAMED RACIAL TENSIONS, THATHAVE DIVIDED US RATHER THAN
BRINGING US TOGETHER.
>> Jon: SO TRUE. AND WHEN WASTHE LAST TIME PAUL McCARTNEY AND
MICHAEL JACKSON DID A DUET?
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT HAPPENINGONCE UNDER OBAMA --
(LAUGHTER)I REMEMBER McCARTNEY STUFFERING
FROM THAT TERRIBLE DISEASE WHEREHE COULD ONLY GROW A SHAVING
CREAM BEARD.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S HOW GLARINGLY
CHALLENGEABLE A STATEMENT THATIS, A CNN REPORTER FOLLOWED UP
ABOUT IT.
>> SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID ONTHE STAGE I THINK BEARS
A FOLLOW-UP, SPECIFICALLY THEPRESIDENT, HOW HAS HE
INFLAMED RACIAL TENSIONS?
>> Jon: AND YOU KNOW, TED,
WHILE YOU TRY AND STRUGGLE TO BESPECIFIC, I'LL JUST READ A
LITTLE SOMETHING JUST INCASE IT TAKES YOU A WHILE.
>> I THINK HE HAS NOT USED HISROLE AS PRESIDENT TO BRING US
TOGETHER.
HE HAS --(LAUGHTER)
-- EXACERBATED RACIALMISUNDERSTANDINGS, RACIAL
TENSIONS FROM BACK AT THEBEER SUMMIT TO A SERIES OF
EFFORTS TO PIT AMERICANSAGAINST EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: "...MEE NAY OSOZ-NYET"(RUSSIAN)
COME ON, CRUZ!
ALL YOU DID WAS TAKE, LIKE, AMINUTE TO SAY THE EXACT SAME
THING, JUST A REPHRASING OF WHATYOU SAID BEFORE!
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THEWAY HE ADVOCATES FOR ANY GIVEN
PLAN IS TO PAINT A, TO BUILD ASTRAW MAN OF THE OPPOSITION
AND THEN TO VILIFY ANDCARICATURE IT.
>> Jon: STAW MAN AND VILIFYING ACARICATURE, HUH?
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IF SAYSOMEONE WAS DESCRIBING AMERICANS
WHO DIDN'T AGREE WITH THEM ON, IDON'T KNOW, MARRIAGE EQUALITY
AND THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOMRESTORATION ACT?
>> WE LOOK AT THE JIHAD AS BEINGWAGED RIGHT NOW IN INDIANA AND
ARKANSAS GOING AFTER PEOPLE OFFAITH WHO RESPECT THE BIBLICAL
TEACHINGS AND MARRIAGE IS THEUNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN.
>> Jon: SO YOU WANT A PRESIDENTWHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER,
WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT IF YOU'REPRO MARRIAGE EQUALITY YOU'RE
THE SAME AS I.S.I.S.
(LAUGHTER)GOT IT!
AND WHAT WOULD THAT WHOLEVILIFYING CARICATURE THING LOOK
LIKE IF IT WAS JUST GENERALLYREFERENCING PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE
WITH YOU.
>> WHEN DID DEMOCRATS ABANDONTHE BILL OF RIGHTS?
THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY HASBECOME AN EXTREME RADICAL PARTY.
THEY CONSIDER MOST OF THECOUNTRY FLYOVER COUNTRY.
SO EXTREME, SO INTOLERANT.
BIRKENSTOCK-WEARING, TREEHUGGING --
LIBERAL FASCISM!
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: REMIND ME AGAIN HOW
PRESIDENT OBAMA HASFAILED US AS A LEADER?
>> WE NEED LEADERSHIP THATBRINGS US TOGETHER INSTEAD OF
TRYING TO DIVIDE US.
>> Jon: THANKS FOR PLAYING.
"LET'S GET RID OF TED CRUZ."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
