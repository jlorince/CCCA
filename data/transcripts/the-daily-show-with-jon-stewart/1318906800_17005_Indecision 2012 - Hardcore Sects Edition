THEY (BEEP) HER FACE.
I'LL PUT A HELMET ON THAT.
OBVIOUSLY WE WERE OFF LAST
WEEK.
SO WE HAVE A LOT TO CATCH UP.
LAST WE LEFT OFF I BELIEVE
RICK PERRY'S ENTRANCE INTO THE
"PLEASE DON'T MAKE US VOTE FOR
ROMNEY" REPUBLICAN RACE.
PERRY BEFORE HE EVER UTTERED A
WORD SHOT TO THE TOP OF THE
FIELD.
UNFORTUNATELY RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT DOES REQUIRE A GOOD
DEAL OF WORD UTTERING.
WHICH PERRY'S DONE ON FOUR
SEPARATE DEBATE OCCASIONS.
>> IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT
WAS ON THE SIDE OF AGAINST THE
SECOND AMENDMENT BEFORE HE WAS
FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
WAS IT... BEFORE HE WAS BEFORE
THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS?
>> Jon: THUS ALMOST COMPLETELY
NOT HELPING THE WIN FOR LOSING
THE BEFORE HE WAS WINNING NOW
HE... HEY, WHO WANTS TO SEE ME
ELECTRO CUTE A GUY.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED IN
THE POLL THERE BUT ALMOST ALL
OF PERRY'S SUPPORT APPEARS TO
HAVE GONE TO HERMAN KAINE
BECAUSE AGAIN NOBODY LIKES
MITT ROMNEY.
NOBODY.
HE IS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY'S ULTIMATE SAFETY
SCHOOL.
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET
INTO HARVARD.
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS LOOKS LIKE
A STRETCH.
SO HELLO GLASS BREAUX STATE.
GO FIGHTING FALLBACKS.
WHY IS IT THAT RICK PERRY WHO
IS BASICALLY A 200-POUND BAG
OF CHOICE CUT GRADE-A
REPUBLICAN DROPPING LIKE A COW
PIE?
IS IT HIS MANGLED DEBATE
PERFORMANCES?
POSSIBLE.
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS LESS THAN
PRISTINE RECORD AS GOVERNOR OF
TEXAS?
PERHAPS.
THE FACT THAT HIS FAMILY'S
LONG-TIME HUNTING FACILITY WAS
FORMERLY CALLED (MUMBLING) IT
HAS THAT NAME (MUMBLING.
>> I KNOW YOU'LL REFRAIN FROM
SAYING THAT WORD.
THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS
CALLED NIGGER HEAD.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, BLACK
WALNUT.
BUT ACCORDING TO THE
GOVERNOR'S WIFE ANITA PERRY,
THE REAL REASON FOR GOVERNOR
RICK PERRY'S DECLINE IS
SOMETHING MUCH MORE INSIDIOUS.
>> WE'VE BEEN BRUTALIZED BY
OUR OPPONENTS, OUR OWN PARTY,
SO MUCH OF THAT IS I THINK
THEY LOOK AT HIM BECAUSE OF
HIS FAITH.
>> Jon: TWO THINGS.
NUMBER ONE.
WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
CRAZY ABOUT THAT PAINTING
BEHIND HER?
I BET IF YOU REMOVE ANITA
PERRY THERE'S A PICTURE OF A
WOMAN WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
HER ALREADY STANDING THERE...
ALL RIGHT.
AND NUMBER TWO, REPUBLICANS
ARE BRUTALIZING RICK PERRY
BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH?
YES, NO ONE GETS IT WORSE FROM
THE BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY THAN EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS.
OR AS THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN, THE
BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
BUT AT LEAST SOME EVANGELICALS
ARE FIGHTING BACK.
LIKE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF
DALLAS PASTOR AND RICK PERRY
SUPPORTER ROBERT JEFFRESS WHO
GOES IN HARD ON MITT ROMNEY
SUPPORTERS.
>> MITT ROMNEY IS A GOOD,
MORAL PERSON BUT HE'S NOT A
CHRISTIAN.
MORMONISM IS NOT CHRISTIANITY.
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED
A CULT BY THE MAINSTREAM OF
CHRISTIANITY.
>> Jon: I MEAN, IF Y'ALL WANT
TO VOTE FOR A CULT LEADER, I'M
NOT GOING TO... THAT IS IS THE
SWEETEST, MOST GOOD-NATURED,
PLEASANT (BEEP) ON AN ENTIRE
RELIGION.
I HAVE EVER SEEN.
BLESS HIS HEART.
HE DESERVES TO BE IN HELL BUT
CERTAINLY ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR
THAN HITLER.
