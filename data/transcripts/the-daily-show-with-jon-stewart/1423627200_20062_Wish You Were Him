>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THEDAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT US A PROGRAM TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT DAVIDAXELROD, HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK,
"BELIEVER", IT'S HIS STORY OFFOLLOWING JUSTIN BIEBER ON TOUR
FOR TWO, TWO YEARS.
YES, DAVID -- OH, I'M SORRY"BELIEVER" NOT "BELIEBER".
AND OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE OTHERTHINGS TO TALK ABOUT.
WE WILL GET TO THAT LATER.
YOU PROBABLY KNOW THINGS THESEPEOPLE DON'T YET WHICH IS
USUALLY A TWIST ON THINGS, BUTTRUST ME, WE'LL GET THERE.
BUT FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO DO THESHOW!
AS YOU KNOW THE HORRIFICSITUATION, THE KILLING OF THAT
JORDANIAN PILOT BY I.S.I.S., THECOUNTRY THERE HAS RALLIED
AROUND IT'S LEADER AND MADE SOMENEW FANS HERE.
>> JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH ISBUILDING A COALITION TO CARRY
OUT SWIFT REVENGE ON ISIS.
>> THE KING HIMSELF HAS TURNEDTHE TABLES ON ISIS.
>> I COULDN'T BE MORE IMPRESSEDWITH THE WAY THE KING OF JORDAN
HAS HANDLED THIS.
>> IT'S A VISION OF SPECIFICSTRENGTH, BOTH IN WORD AND DEED.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> LOOK, I LIKE THIS KINGABDULLAH GUY,
SORT OF A CLINT EASTWOOD/JOHNWAYNE HYBRID.
>> THE KING QUOTED CLINTEASTWOOD FROM THE MOVIE
"UNFORGIVEN."
>> Jon: YES, HE'S LIKE CLINTEASTWOOD FROM "UNFORGIVEN."
AND HE WORE A HAT FROM "RAIDERSOF THE LOST ARK."
WHILE RIDING A TAUNTAUN FROM"STAR WARS."
NO, THEY WERE ESPECIALLYIMPRESSED WITH KING ABDULLAH
VIS A VIS THE GUY WE GOTHEADING UP OUR SQUAD.
>> HE'S A REAL LEADER UNLIKE THEPRESENT OCCUPANT OF OUR
WHITE HOUSE.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IT'SGOING TO TAKE TO CONVINCE
THE PRESIDENT TO GET INVOLVED. IWISH WE HAD THAT.
WE CRAVE THAT IN THE UNITEDSTATES.
>> CAN WE JUST POINT OUT THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA AND THE KING OF JORDAN?
>> WHO DO YOU THINK IS TOUGHERAGAINST ISIS?
IS IT KING ABDULLAH OR PRESIDENTOBAMA?
FOR ME, THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS.
>> Jon: ME, TOO!
WHEN AMERICA WAS ATTACKED BYISIS, PRESIDENT OBAMA DID QUOTE
CLINT EASTWOOD, BUT FROMTHIS MOVIE.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT WHATHAPPENED WITH US JUST
HAPPENS TO ANYONE, WHAT WEFEEL, WHAT WE FEEL FOR EACH
OTHER?
>> Jon: THE POINT IS CLINTEASTWOOD HAS HAD AN AMAZING AND
VERY VARIED CAREER.
BUT ULTIMATELY, WHAT THERIGHT IS SAYING IS WHY CAN'T
OBAMA BE MORE LIKE THIS POWERFULMUSLIM KING?
WHICH IS WEIRD!
(APPLAUSE)BECAUSE, IF I MAY SAY, THAT'S
ALSO BEEN THEIR BIGGESTCOMPLAINT ABOUT OBAMA!
>> THE PRESIDENT ACTING MORELIKE KING OBAMA.
>> KING OBAMA.
>> HE IS ACTING LIKE A KING.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ON AMISSION TO PROTECT THE IMAGE OF
ISLAM.
>> ANSWERS TO THE QUR'ANFIRST AND TO THE CONSTITUTION
SECOND.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT YOU LIKEDTHAT!
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE WEDIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT OBAMA!
IT WAS HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN!(LAUGHTER)
NOW, APPARENTLY THEY ARE UPSETTHAT OBAMA IS NOT DOING
AS MUCH AS KINGABDULLAH TOATTACK ISIS.
EVEN THOUGH THE UNITED STATESHAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER
80% OF THE AIRSTRIKES AGAINSTISIS.
IT'S A FACT THAT THEY IGNOREEVEN WHEN THAT FACT IS SPELLED
OUT DIRECTLY NEXT TO THEIR FACE.
>> HE JUST NEEDS TO STAND UP,HE NEEDS TO BE COURAGEOUS.
>> IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HEREALLY WANTS TO DO THAT.
I MEAN, I'M JUST, I'M JUST BEINGFRANK.
>> Jon: IF YOU JUST TURNYOUR -- THEY WON'T EVEN TURN
THEIR HEADS TO THE LEFT!
IT'S AMAZING!
SO LISTEN, JUST OUT OFCURIOSITY, WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEENTHESE TWO POWERFUL MUSLIM KINGS
BOTH BOMBING ISIS?
>> ABDULLAH ISCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE
JORDANIAN AIR FORCE.
PICTURES OF HIM INCOMBAT FATIGUES ARE POSTED ON A
JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT FACEBOOKACCOUNT.
>> HE'S PROJECTING THIS IMAGETHAT IS OUT THERE ON SOCIAL
MEDIA OF HERE'S A GUY WHO'SGOING TO KICK THEIR BUTTS.
JUST LOOK AT THAT PICTURE.
>> Jon: JUST LOOK AT IT!
YOU KNOW, THE PICTURES PEOPLEPOST ON FACEBOOK ARE NOT
NECESSARILY THE MOST ACCURATEREPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR LIVES.
FOR INSTANCE, YOU MIGHT LOOK ATTHIS PICTURE AND SAY WHY CAN'T
MY CAT BE AS STYLISHAS THIS CAT?
WHEN IN FACT THAT CAT JUSTBORROWED THAT HAT FROM A FRIEND
TO ATTEND A FUNERAL.
HE WANTED TO LOOK NICE.
BUT IT ISN'T JUST MUSLIMKINGS THAT CONSERVATIVES WISH
OBAMA WAS MORE ALIKE. IT'S ALLSORTS OF MUSLIM AUTOCRATS.
>> I HOPE ONE DAY THAT OUR TOPLEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY WILL
HAVE THE COURAGE OF PRESIDENTEL-SISI IN EGYPT THAT WILL
REFLECT AS GENERAL EL-SISI HASTHE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF
THEIR COUNTRY.
>> Jon: NO THAT -- HE IS DEADON!
EL-SISI, AS A MATTER OFFACT, HE REFLECTS THE WILL OF
HIS PEOPLE SO MUCH, HE WASELECTED WITH 97% OF THE VOTE!
THAT IS LANDSLIDE!
AND THE OTHER 3% OF THE VOTEWERE WON BY PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOW JAIL. ANYWAY, THE POINTIS THIS,
SO I GOT IT, CONSERVATIVES, YOUWANT THE PRESIDENT TO BE MORE
LIKE A MUSLIM DICTATOR WHO GETSELECTED WITH 97% OF THE VOTE.
BUT I BET THEY'RE WILLING TO BEFLEXIBLE ON THE MUSLIM PART.
>> LIKE HIM OR NOT, AND IDON'T LIKE HIM,
PUTIN'S A LEADER, OBAMA'S ALAWYER.
>> PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT PUTINAS ONE WHO WRESTLES BEARS AND
DRILLS FOR OIL.
THEY LOOK AT OUR PRESIDENT ASONE WHO WEARS MOM JEANS AND
EQUIVOCATES AND BLOVIATES.
>> PUTIN DECIDES WHAT HE WANTSTO DO.
HE MAKES A DECISION ANDEXECUTES IT, QUICKLY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A LEADER.
>> Jon: OR A SOCIOPATH WITH NOIMPULSE CONTROL!
(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)
SO, IF I'M -- IF I'MUNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY
AND I THINK I AM, THE PARAGONSOF LEADERSHIP ARE A KING,
MILITARY DICTATOR AND APOWER-CRAZED WANNABE CZAR.
SEEMS KIND OF AT ODDS WITH THEONE THING YOU GUYS CLAIM TO
VALUE THE MOST.
>> I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND VALUEITS FREEDOMS.
>> THE MOST FREE COUNTRY IN THEHISTORY OF THE WORLD.
>> FREEDOM MARKET ENTERPRISE,FREEDOMS FOR AMERICANS.
>> WE HAVE FREEDOM, WEHAVE DEMOCRACY.
>> I DID.
CAN WE SHOW FREEDOM?
MY DOG FREEDOM.
>> HIS NAME IS FREEDOM.
>> OF COURSE IT IS.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU NAMEDYOUR DOG FREEDOM."
>> Jon: YOUR DOG'S NAMEIS FREEDOM?
WHY NOT CHANGE IT NOW TO "KINGAB-DOG-AH" OR,
"VLADIMIR PUP-TIN"?
ALTHOUGH THE REAL PROBLEM IS IFYOUR DOG RUNS AWAY AND YOU GO
OUT LOOKING FOR HIM, YOU'REGONNA SOUND, IT'S GONNA SOUND
A LITTLE LIKE "BRAVEHEART".
(MEL GIBSON SCREAMING"FREEDOOOOM!" IN BRAVEHEART.)
(APPLAUSE)THE POINT IS THIS -- APPARENTLY
YOU LOVE FREEDOM, YOU JUST WISHIT WAS BEING ADMINISTERED IN
THIS COUNTRY BY A DICTATOR.
IT'S KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE IFPRESIDENT OBAMA STARTED ACTING
MORE LIKE ANY OF THE GUYS WHOSELEADERSHIP YOU ADMIRE, PRETTY
SURE I KNOW THE FIRST PLACE HE'DSHUT DOWN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
