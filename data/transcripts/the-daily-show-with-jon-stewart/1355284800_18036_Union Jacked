>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE.
OUR GUEST, LAURA LINNEY.
SHE'S IN THE NEW MOVIE IN "HYDE PARK ON THE HUDSON." DAISY WAS APPARENTLY F.D.R.'S
CONFIDANTE AT A TIME WHEN CONFIDANTE MEANT "GUY I HAVE SEX WITH." (LAUGHTER)
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN MICHIGAN WHERE TEN MONTHS AGO MICHIGAN'S GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER -- (LAUGHTER).
THAT'S DEE SNYDER.
DUKE SNYDER.
THAT'S ROY SCHEIDER.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S JUST A PICTURE OF ME LOOKING AKNOWED WITH THIS BIT.
THERE WE GO.
RICK SNYDER.
ANYWAY, THIS (BLEEP) GUY.
MICHIGAN GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER WENT BEFORE CONGRESS TEN MONTHS AGO TO SAY HE WAS NOT
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED AT THIS TIME IN MAKING THE BEDROCK UNION STATE OF MICHIGAN A RIGHT TO
WORK STATE.
>> RIGHT TO WORK IS AN ISSUE THAT IS A VERY DIVISIVE ISSUE.
PEOPLE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT.
WE HAVE MANY PROBLEMS IN MICHIGAN THAT ARE MUCH MORE PRESSING THAT I WANT TO FIND
COMMON GROUND ISSUES WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON BEFORE WE GET INTO DIVISIVE ISSUES.
>> Jon: (WHISPERING) GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.
(LAUGHTER) HE WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON COMMON GROUND THINGS PEOPLE FROM MICHIGAN WANT AND NEED.
MORE ROBOCOPPERS ON THE STREETS OF NEW DETROIT.
(LAUGHTER) GETTING THE TOURISM BOARD TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER ON ITS NEW SLOGAN.
(LAUGHTER) AND FINALLY -- (APPLAUSE).
FINALLY MICHIGAN WAS GOING TO FIN THEIR STATUE I HAVE BEEN PETITIONING FOR ONLINE.
(LAUGHTER) THEY'VE GOT A ROCKY STATUE IN PHILLY, THEY SHOULD HAVE A KID ROCK STATUE IN DETROIT.
THAT'S SOME BULL (BLEEP) RIGHT THERE.
(LAUGHTER) NONE OF THAT IS DONE.
HE HASN'T DONE ANY OF IT SO -- >> MOMENTS AGO THE MICHIGAN HOUSE APPROVED A RIGHT-TO-WORK
BILL THE STATE SENATE PASSED LAST WEEK.
>> Jon: DOESN'T MATTER.
YOUR GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT TO WORK ON THAT DIVISIVE ISSUE.
>> REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER PROMISES TO SIGN THE BILL AS SOON AS IT HITS HIS DESK
WHICH COULD BE WITHIN HOURS.
>> Jon: ACTUALLY, BETWEEN THE TIME THAT WE CUT THAT SOUNDBITE AND NOW HE ALREADY SIGNED IT!
SO (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?
SO WHAT?
SO WHAT?
SO THIS GUY WHO REALLY LOOKS PLEASANT ENOUGH.
(LAUGHTER) , MAYBE IT WON'T BE SO BAD.
I MEAN, THE PHRASE "RIGHT TO WORK" IS SUCH A POSITIVE AND UPLIFTING MESSAGE.
WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY DO TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE UNIONS THAT ALSO SUPPORTS WORKERS RIGHTS.
THE LAW PROBABLY STRENGTHENS UNIONS.
>> IT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS TO MANDATE THAT EMPLOYEES BE PART OF A
UNION OR PAY ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THAT UNION.
>> Jon: OR DESTROY THE ONLY LEVERAGE UNIONS HAVE TO STAY AFLOAT, ONE OR THE OTHER.
SO IT'S REALLY A RIGHT-TO-WORK AROUND THE UNION FOR THE CORPORATIONS.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY NAMED FOR THE OPPOSITE OF THE THING THEY DO.
LIKE STRIP BARS CALL THEMSELVES GENTLEMEN'S CLUBS.
(LAUGHTER) OR THE T.V. NETWORK DEDICATED TO MAKING US STUPIDER IS CALLED "THE LEARNING CHANNEL."
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OR A T.V. SHOW THAT ONLY AIRS FOUR DAYS A WEEK CALLS IT A
DAILY SHOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT'S THE DEAL, GOVERNOR SNYDER?
>> I SID THIS WASN'T ON MY AGENDA FOR SOME TIME BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT, WE'RE LOSING A MAJOR
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
INDIANA HAS BECOME A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE AND I'VE LOOKED AT THEIR PIPELINE.
THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES LOOKING TO COME TO
INDIANA AND GROW IN INDIANA DUE TO THIS LEGISLATION.
>> Jon: INDIANA!
THOSE SWEET-FACED GOOD NATURED JOB-STEALING SONS OF BITCHES.
(LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE, LET'S GO WITH THE RIGHT SPACING FOR THAT.
INDIA, NORTH AMERICA!
WELL, DON'T THINK WE WON'T DETECT YOUR CALL CENTER ACCENTS, INDIA N.A.
HOW ARE MICHIGAN'S UNION MEMBERS AKING THIS NEWS?T >> PROUNION PROTESTERS ARE
SWARMING THE CAPITAL BUILDING IN LANCING.
>> HEY, HEY, HO, HO, RIGHT TO WORK HAS GOT TO GO.
>> UNION BUSTING IS DISGUSTING!
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: DUDE, YOU'RE FROM MICHIGAN, DETROIT, "8 MILE." YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH
BETTER RHYMES THAT BUSTING-DISGUSTING IF YOU WANT TO WIN THE CLIMACTIC RAP BATTLE.
YOU HAVE TO PUT EFFORT INTO IT.
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK, YOU HAVE ONE JOB AT ONE FACTORY, WHEN YOU SEIZE EVERY
BENEFIT YOU COULD, YO, OUR PALMS ARE SWEATY, KNEES WEEK, ARMS HEAVY, WORKING IN A FACTORY ALL
DAY BUILDING CHEVYS, LIKE THE VOLT, YOU PLUG IT IN, AND THEN YOU WIN -- ECOLOGICALLY, BECAUSE
IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL RACE YOU WOULD NOT -- ACTUALLY.
YOU'VE GOT TO DUES COLLECT FOR THE UNIONS ORO BAHTS ARE GOING TO COME AND TAKE AWAY OUR JOBS
OR TO THE CHINESE KIDS WITH THE TINY HANDS TO WORK AND GO -- â™ª THIS OF HA TUNETY COMES ONCE
IN A LIFETIME NOTE?
NOTE YO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED?
IF I PERFORM MY
