ALL THAT TOMORROW.
BUT FIRST, FROM NEWS OF BIRTH
OVERSEAS TO NEWS OF DEATH BACK
HERE IN THE U.S.
>> IT HAS BEEN LONG FEARED.
THIS MORNING IT IS REALITY IN
DETROIT.
THE MOTOR CITY FILED FOR CHAPTER
9 PROTECTION YESTERDAY.
>> MO TOWN IS SINGING THE BLUES.
TOWN TONIGHT IS NO TOWN.
AMERICA'S MOTOR CITY RUNS OUT
OF GAS.
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, DOES
THAT TONE SEEM APPROPRIATE TO
ANYONE?
A MAJOR AMERICAN CITY HAS
DECLARED BANKRUPTCY WITH
DEVASTATING HUMAN COSTS.
MAYBE PUMP THE BRAKES ON THE CAR
A LITTLE BIT.
IF CHICAGO WENT BANKRUPT, WOULD
YOU SAY THE WINDY CITY JUST LEFT
OUT ITS FINAL FART?
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.
IF HOUSTON HAD A DEVASTATING
EARTHQUAKE WOULD YOU START BY
SAYING, "HOUSTON, WE HAVE A
PROBLEM."
THE PROBLEM IS YOUR BUILDINGS
ARE COLLAPSING AND THERE ARE
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER
THE RUBBLE.
NO, THIS IS NO PLACE FOR JOKES
AND PUNS APART FROM THIS ONE.
THAT'S TOP NOTCH.
THIS IS OUR JOB.
JUST THE ONE BRIGHT SIDE IS THAT
DETROIT MIGHT GET A LITTLE
ECONOMIC BOOST FROM ALL THOSE
REPORTERS FLOCKING TO IT TO
COVER THE STORY, RIGHT?
>> MIKE TOBIN LIVE IN CHICAGO
WITH THE NEWS.
MIKE, A DRAMATIC AFTERNOON IN
DETROIT.
>> WHETHER THAT'S CHAP TERM 9
HOW THEY GO TO THE MOTIONS I
DON'T KNOW BUT JEFF LOCK DOES.
HE'S RIGHT NEAR DETROIT IN
CHICAGO.
>> John: REALLY?
CHICAGO.
SO YOU HAVE REPORTERS TAKE GUN
FIRE IN WAR ZONES ALL OVER THE
WORLD.
YOU'VE HAD THEM GEAR GASSED
DURING PROTESTS.
YOU'VE FORCED THEM TO TAKE 200
MILES AN HOUR WINDS TO THE FACE
DURING STORMS BUT APPARENTLY
HAVING THEM STAND ON A CORNER IN
DOWNTOWN DETROIT, OH, THAT IS
JUST TOO DANGEROUS AN
ASSIGNMENT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TELL THAT EXACTLY... EXACTLY HOW
ARE THINGS IN DETROIT?
>> THE DETROIT HAS LOST MORE
THAN 237,000 RESIDENTS IN THE
PAST DECADE.
>> 78,000 CITY STRUCTURES HAVE
BEEN AABANDONNED.
>> 50% OF THE PARKS CLOSED IN
2008.
40% OF THE STREET LIGHTS DON'T
WORK.
>> THIS IS A CITY THAT IS CLOSED
100 SCHOOLS SINCE 2004.
>> FOLKS IN DETROIT WAIT AN
AVERAGE OF 58 MINUTES FOR POLICE
TO RESPOND.
THAT'S COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL
AVERAGE OF 11 MINUTES.
>> John: IT TAKES 58 MINUTES FOR
THE POLICE TO COME.
SO WAIT.
HOLD ON.
IF YOU GET SHOT IN DETROIT, YOU
CAN GET A PIZZA FASTER THAN YOU
CAN GET A COP.
IN FACT MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO SURVIVE THERE.
HEY, DOMINOES I WOULD LIKE ONE
LARGE PIZZA WITH TWO POLICEMEN
AND A SIDE OF PARAMEDICS,
PLEASE.
AND CAN YOU STUFF THE CRUST WITH
GAUZE BECAUSE I'M BLEEDING
TERRIBLY.
THANK YOU.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW LOOK.
DETROIT HAS NOT BEEN IN A GOOD
WAY FOR DECADES.
BUT THIS BANKRUPTCY STILL CAME
AT A SURPRISE ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE CITY RECENTLY HIRED KEVYN
ORR AS EMERGENCY MANAGER TO
AVOID THIS SITUATION.
>> WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CITY
BACK IN LATE MARCH THE GOAL WAS
TO TRY TO FIX THE CITY WITHOUT
GOING THROUGH BANKRUPTCY.
BUT THE MERE FACT THAT HIS
BACKGROUND IS ONE.
TOP BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS IN THE
COUNTRY, IT WAS OBVIOUS IF WE
COULDN'T FIX THE CITY THROUGH
NEGOTIATION, BANKRUPTCY WOULD BE
THE NEXT ROUTE TO GO.
>> John: THAT DOES SEEM A LITTLE
SUSPECT.
I MEAN BANKRUPTCY LAWYER THAT
YOU HIRED SUGGESTED DECLARING
BANKRUPTCY.
IT'S LIKE PICKING A DEMOLITION
EXPERT TO RESHINGLE YOUR ROOF.
I TOOK A LOOK UP THERE AND I
THINK DYNAMITE IS IS DEFINITELY
THE WAY TO GO.
THIS IS SUCH A SAD FALL FROM
GRACE.
FOR ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT
CITIES.
IT USED TO BE AN ECONOMIC
POWERHOUSE.
PEOPLE SANG SONGS ABOUT IT.

RADIOS PEOPLE HAD TO HIRE MEN TO
