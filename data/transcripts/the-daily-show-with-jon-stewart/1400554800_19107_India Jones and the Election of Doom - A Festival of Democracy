TRAVELED TO INDIATO REPORT ON THEIR JUST ADORABLE
LARGEST DEMOCRACY ON EARTH.TONIGHT IN PART 2
OF HIS SERIES JASON LEARNSHOW INDIA HANDLES THE
ELECTIONS THEMSELVES.
AS I TRAVEL THROUGH INDIA IWAS STRUCK BY THIS FESTIVAL
OF DEMOCRACY BUT IF THIS ISTHEIR IDEA OF A MORNING
COMMUTE THERE WAS NO WAYTHEY COULD POSSIBLY ENGINEER
ELECTIONS THAT RIVAL OURS.
I SAT WITH THE FORMER HEADOF INDIA'S POWERFUL ELECTION
COMMISSION TO SEE HOW THISADORABLE DEMOCRACY HANDLES
MODERN POLITICS.
>> WE IN INDIA HAVE SURELYTHE BIGGEST DEMOCRACY ON THE
PLANET.
AND WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BETHE GREATEST.
>> I DON'T WANT TO BAG BUT ACOUPLE OF OUR STATES HAVE
BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITHELECTRONIC VOTING.
WE'RE KIND OF PIONEERS WHENIT COMES TO THAT.
>> DO YOU WE HAVE 100%ELECTRONIC VOTING.
>> 100 PERCENT.
>> 100 PERCENT.
>> OKAY, FINE, BUT INAMERICA WE HAVE A VARIETY OF
WAYS TO KEEP VOTER TURNOUTLOW SO THAT OUR DEMOCRACY
DOESN'T BECOME TOOREPRESENTATIVE.
HOW DOES INDIA TAMP DOWNTHEIR LESS DESIRED VOTERS.
>> WHO ARE YOURDISENFRANCHISED VOTERS?
>> OH UH, OH, ACTUALLY, NOBODY.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO-- WHAT ABOUT THE LEPERS
IS WHAT I AM SAYING?
>> OH, THEY, THEY VOTE.
>> WHAT?
>> THEY VOTE.
>> I WAS JUST MAKING A JOKE.
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE LEPERSHERE.
>> OF COURSE, EVERY VOTECOUNTS AND EVERY VOTE IS
EQUAL.
>> YEAH, RIGHT, I OBTAINED THISACTUAL TRAINING VIDEO FROM THE
ELECTION COMMISSION THATSHOWS THEY DON'T REALLY DO
THAT MUCH TO ACCOMMODATE THELEPER VOTE BECAUSE IN INDIA
THEY MARK YOUR FINGER AFTERYOU VOTE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF
YOU DON'T HAVE A LEFT INDEXFINGER.
OH, YOU GO TO THE NEXT ONE?
OK, WELL WHAT IF YOU HAVE NOFINGERS?
OH, YOU MARK THE HAND.
NO ARM?
HOLY [BLEEP] THEYMAKE IT EASY FOR YOU.
BUT IF THEY LET LEPERS VOTEWHAT GROUP DO THEY PREVENT
FROM VOTING?
>> EVERYONE, RICH, POOR, URBAN,RURAL, LITERATE, ILLITERATE,
EVERYONE, HOMELESS, THEY'RE ALLVOTERS.
>> YOU LET YOUR ILLITERATE VOTE?
>> OF COURSE. SOME OF THEILLITERATES ARE THE MOST
ENTHUSIASTIC VOTERS. SO, THAT'SWHY FOR THEM WE HAVE SYMBOLS.
>> YOU JUST PICK EITHER THEKITE OR THE COFFEE CUP.
>> WHAT IS THIS ONEHERE? THIS LOOKS LIKE TWO
PENISES.
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT IS NOT VERY CLEAR.
>> NO, NO. IT'S VERY CLEAR ITLOOKS LIKE TWO [BLEEP]
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO MAKEIT VERY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT HAS
TO CARRY THE LAST PERSON WITHYOU.
>> AND HE LITERALLY MEANS THELAST PERSON.
>> WE HAVE A POLLING STATION FORA SINGLE VOTER IN THE FOREST OF
GUJARAT.
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE ANINCREDIBLE WASTE OF RESOURCES.
>> THAT IS A VERY OFFENSIVESTATEMENT.
>> BUT IT WAS TRUE,EVERYWHERE I WENT BY BOAT,
OX CART, FARM EQUIPMENT ORTHE PATEL FAMILY STATION
WAGON THERE WAS A POLLINGSTATION.
LITERALLY ONE STATION EVERYTWO KILOMETERS ACROSS THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY.
AND THEY WERE SURPRISINGLYCOMFORTABLE.
>> I LOVE THE SPREAD YOU PUT OUTFOR THE MEDIA,
THAT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE.THESE CHIPS ARE GREAT.
>> MAYBE NOT FOR MEDIA,IT IS FOR OUR VOTERS.
>> THIS STUFF'S FOR THE VOTERS?
>> YES.
>> AND AMAZINGLY THE VOTERSACTUALLY LIKED IT.
>> PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINKTHEIR VOTE COUNTS HERE?
>> WE BELIEVE OUR VOTES TRULYCOUNT.
AND WE WILL USE THEM TOBRING CHANGES TO THE RULING
CONGRESS PARTY.
>> SURELY THE RULINGCONGRESS PARTY MUST BE
WORRIED ABOUT ALL THISDEMOCRACY.
I SAT DOWN WITH ONE OF THEIRTOP MEMBERS.
>> WE PREFER A SYSTEMIN INDIA WHERE IT'S
ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES THATDECIDE THAT.
>> THERE ARE THINGS YOUCOULD DO TO PREVENT YOURSELF
FROM LOSING.>> AH, YOU MEAN BY ENSURING
THAT PEOPLE CAN'TREGISTER TO VOTE?
>> EXACTLY.
>> WE DON'T DO THAT IN INDIA.
>> EVEN IF IT MEANS YOU'RE GOINGTO LOSE.
>> WELL, I THINK IT WILL BEREVEALED BY THE VOTERS ON
THE 16th OF MAY.
>> AND REVEALED IT WAS.
THEY GOT THEIR ASSES KICKEDWHEN 67% OF INDIAN VOTERS
SHOWED UP AT THE POLLS.
A NUMBER WE HAVEN'T SEENSINCE THE ELECTION OF 1900.
>> HOW CAN SOMEONE WHO LOOKSLIKE YOU AND SOUNDS LIKE
YOU BE SUCH A [BLEEP]POLITICIAN.
