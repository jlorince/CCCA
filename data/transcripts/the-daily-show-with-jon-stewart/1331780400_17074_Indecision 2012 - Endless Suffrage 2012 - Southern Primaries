[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HEY, WHAT'S UP?
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, RACHEL WEISZ,
STAR OF "THE DEEP BLUE SEA," BUT
I BRING YOU GREETINGS TONIGHT
FROM LEBANON VIA GERMANY.
[APPLAUSE]
THAT IS THE BROAD INTERNATIONAL
AUDIENCE THAT WE HAVE HERE,
LEBANON VIA GERMANY, OR AS WE'RE
REFERRING TO IT NOW, LEBARNANY,
GERMANON.
LAST NIGHT WAS OBVIOUSLY TUESDAY
NIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
ONCE MORE ON TO THE BREECH OF
ENDLESS SUFFRAGE 2012 AS VOTERS
IN ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, HAWAII
AND AMERICAN SAMOA HEADED TO THE
POLLS TO SELECT THE REPUBLICAN
NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, AND THE
BIG STORY LINE WAS...
>> IT IS MAKE-OR-BREAK NIGHT FOR
NEWT GINGRICH.
>> THIS COULD BE GINGRICH'S LAST
STAND.
>> IF GINGRICH LOSES EITHER OF
THESE SOUTHERN STATES, WHERE CAN
HE WIN?
>> IF YOU CAN'T WIN THERE, YOU
CAN'T WIN ANYWHERE.
>> HIS RATIONALE FOR MOVING
FORWARD STARTS TO SLIP AWAY.
>> NEWT HAS TO HAVE THE SOUTH.
>> OH, IT APPEARS WE HAVE A
GENTLEMAN CALLER AND HIS HEAD IS
ENORMOUS.
[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT]
SO DID NEWT WIN THE SOUTH?
WELL, ACTUALLY RICK SANTORUM WON
ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI, AND
MITT ROMNEY WON HAWAII AND
AMERICAN SAMOA.
HERE'S A LITTLE MNEMONIC DEVICE
TO HELP YOU REMEMBER.
PLACES YOU CAN GET TO IN A
WINNEBAGO GO TO SANTORUM.
PLACES THAT REQUIRE A JET OR A
YACHT GO TO ROMNEY.
[LAUGHTER]
ROMNEY, OF COURSE...
[APPLAUSE]
ROMNEY ALWAYS DOES WELL WITH
ISLANDS.
THAT'S WHERE HIS MONEY LIVES.
SO GINGRICH DID NOT GET THE
THING THAT HE HAD TO HAVE, THUS
DOOMING HIS ONCE-PROMISING
CAMPAIGN.
HIS HUMBLE CONCESSION LAST NIGHT
WAS HALLMARK OF AMERICAN... OH,
JUST [BLEEPED] IT.
HE'S ACTING LIKE HE WON.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS TONIGHT
PROVED IS THAT THE ELITE MEDIA'S
EFFORT TO CONVINCE THE NATION
THAT MITT ROMNEY IS INEVITABLE
JUST COLLAPSED.
WE WILL NOW HAVE THREE OR FOUR
DAYS OF THE NEWS MEDIA SAYING,
WHY DOESN'T GINGRICH QUIT.
>> Jon: THESE ARE SOME OF THE
NATION'S BRIGHTEST MINDS WHO
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY I, NEWT
GINGRICH, WON'T QUILT.
WAS IT A PROMISE TO A SICK
CHILD?
WAS HE TOLD BY A WIZARD IF HE
DOESN'T STAY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL
RACE THE WORLD WILL FALL INTO
DARKNESS?
IS NEWT'S CAMPAIGN SOME KIND OF
JOAQUIN PHOENIX PERFORMANCE ART
THAT, I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL
EVENTUALLY GET BUT STILL IN THE
LIKE OR THINK WAS THAT FUNNY?
MY POINT IS I'M NOT QUITTING.
NEWT 2012!
YOU'LL SEE.
YOU'LL ALL SEE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHY WON'T GINGRICH QUIT?
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
HE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF WINNING.
>> THE FACT IS IN BOTH STATES,
THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES GOT
NEARLY 70% OF THE VOTE.
BETWEEN SANTORUM AND MYSELF, WE
WILL GET OVER TWO-THIRDS OF THE
DELEGATES AND THE SO-CALLED
FRONT-RUNNER WILL GET LESS THAN
ONE-THIRD OF THE DELEGATES.
>> Jon: RIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T
GET TO ADD SANTORUM'S SUM TO
YOURS TO MAKE IT SOUND
IMPRESSIVE.
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN ME AND
LeBRON JAMES LAST NIGHT, WE
SCORED 36 POINTS.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S NOT YOUR TOTAL!
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU ADD ROMNEY'S
DELEGATES TO MINE, I'VE ACTUALLY
WON.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT WHAT ABOUT SANTORUM, THE
VICTOR?
HOW DID HE TAKE THE NEWS OF HE
AND GINGRICH'S CO-VICTORY?
>> THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT
ORDINARY FOLKS DOING
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS.
>> Jon: REALLY?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT NBC'S
"HEROES" WAS ABOUT.
DO YOU HAVE AN
