WELCOME BACK.  MY GUEST TONIGHT A REPORTER FOR
THE TORONTO STAR NEWSPAPER, HER NEW BOOK CALLED "CRAZY TOWN,"
THE ROB FORD STORY, ROBYN DOOLITTLE.
[APPLAUSE]THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.  SO YOU'RE A REPORTER AT THE
TORONTO STAR.  HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN COVERING
TORONTO CITY HALL?  >> I ARRIVED JANUARY 2010 IN
TIME TO WATCH THE MAYORAL ELECTION THAT BROUGHT US ROB
FORD.
>> WHEN YOU ARRIVED THERE AND ROB FORD BECAME MAYOR, WHAT'S
CANADIAN FOR ALLELUIA?  DID YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT THIS
WILL BE AN EVENTFUL FEW YEARS FOR ME?
>> THE FIRST LITTLE WHILE THAT ROB FORD WAS MAYOR, HE WAS NEVER
THE TYPICAL MOLD OF A POLITICIAN.
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY COLORFUL AND HE DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF FRIENDS
AND HE WAS AGGRESSIVE.
>> HE STARTED OFF SOMEWHAT POSITIVE WITH THE COLORFUL
THING.  VERY QUICKLY WENT IN TO
AGGRESSIVE.
>> IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THAT I STARTED HEARING
ABOUT DOMESTIC INCIDENTS AT THE MAYOR'S HOME, THEN RUMORS OF
DRUGS AND THEN HE STOPPED COMINGTO CITY HALL EVERY DAY.
HIS STAFF DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS SOMETIMES.
AND IT WAS A YEAR AFTER THAT THAT --
>> LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
>> OKAY.
>> SO THERE'S RUMORS OF DOMESTICABUSE, DRUGS AND ABSENTEEISM.
>> RIGHT.
>> AND EVERYONE WAITED A YEAR.  HOW DOES HE GET AWAY WITH THIS?
IS HE JUST -- WHAT KEEPS HIM LOVABLE AND IN CHARGE?
>> WELL, PART OF IT, I THINK YOUGUYS TAKE FOR GRANTED HOW GREAT
YOUR ACCESS INFORMATION LAWS AT LEAST COMPARED TO CANADIAN
LAWS.
>> REALLY?
>> I HEAR ABOUT INSTANCES,
N 2011 THE MAYOR'S WIFE'SPARENTS CALLED 911 TO SAY ROB
FORD HAD TAKEN THEIR CHILDREN, HE WAS DRUNK DRIVING AND GOING
TO THE AIRPORT.
>> OH, GOD.
>> I CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY WON'T CONFIRM THAT THE CALL EVEN
OCCURRED, THAT THEY'RE INVESTIGATING ANYTHING.
YOU CAN FILE AN ACCESS REQUEST FOR THAT AND NOT GET ANYTHING
BACK IN OUR COUNTRY.  AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE
PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE REPORTING ONTHESE ISSUES IS IT'S SO HARD TO
FOLLOW UP ON THIS STUFF.  SO IT TOOK A FULL YEAR TO DO
THIS INVESTIGATION.  MY PAPER TOOK A BIG RISK BY
PUTTING OUT THERE IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR, WITH MY COLLEAGUE
KEVIN DONOVAN WROTE A STORY SAYING THE MAYOR'S STAFF WANTED
HIM TO GO TO REHAB, THEY FELT HIS DRINKING WAS IMPACTING HIS
WORK, THAT HE HAD BEEN KICKED OUT OF A MILITARY BALL FOR
SHOWING UP IMPAIRED AND THAT WASBEFORE THE CRACK STORY.
>> THE MAN IS, IF I MAY, AN ENTIRE SEASON OF A COPS EPISODE.
AND SO NOW ALL THIS, YOU'VE DONEALL THE LEG WORK, ALL THE,
YOU'VE GOTTEN PAST THIS, YOU YOURSELF WITNESSED THE CRACK
VIDEO, THE INFAMOUS CRACK VIDEO.
CAN HE HOLD HIS CRACK?  IS HE A GOOD, WHAT DOES HE
APPEAR?  >> PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THEY ARE,
LIKE SOME OF THE SOURCES THAT I SPOKE WITH FOR MY BOOK ARE IN
AWE OF HIS STAMINA, I GUESS, FORLACK OF A BETTER WORD.
THE FACT THAT WHAT HE PUTS IN TOHIS BODY WHILE BEING AS
UNHEALTHY AS HE IS WITH THE WHOLE OTHER PART OF HIS LIFE.
>> SURE.
>> THAT WOULD BE IMPRESSIVE FOR LET'S SAY A COMPETITIVE EATER.
BUT HE IS THE MAYOR OF TORONTOAND YET HE'S RUNNING AGAIN.
>> AND I THINK OUTSIDE OF TORONTO PEOPLE KNOW ROB FORD AS
THE CRAZY CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR WHO ENDS UP ON YOUTUBE FOR DOING
STUPID STUFF.  BUT THERE'S THIS REALLYINTERESTING
FASCINATING STORY THAT BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT ABOUT A FAMILY
THAT FANCIES ITSELF A POLITICAL DYNASTY, FORD FAMILY.
>> SO IT'S LIKE THEY'RE THE KENNEDYS, IF THE KENNEDYS HAD
ALL SMOKED CRACK.
>> THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS CANADIAN KENNEDYS.
>> FOR REAL?  >> FOR REAL.
THAT'S CHAPTER TWO.
>> BUT ALL JOKING ASIDE, SORT OFA CARICATURE, THIS MAN IS GOING
TO DIE AND PROBABLY RELATIVELY SOON.
AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE DISQUALIFYING FACTOR FOR
TORONTONIANS.
>> YES.
>> THANK YOU.  WOULD ALMOST NOT BE THE FACT
THAT YOUR MAYOR IS HORRIBLY IMPAIRED WHEN AN EMERGENCY MIGHT
ARISE BUT THE FACT HE REFUSES TOGET HELP.
>> AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
>> AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.  THAT TO ME SHOULD BE THE
DISQUALIFYING FACTOR IN THIS.
>> RIGHT.  YEAH, AND IT JUST SPEAKS TO ALARGER
POLITICAL DIVISION THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR CITY.
BUT ALSO I THINK THE BIG TAKE AWAY FOR SO MANY POLITICIANS,
WHAT MADE ROB FORD IS THAT WHEN HE WAS A CITY COUNSELOR FOR 10
YEARS, HE RETURNED EVERY PHONE CALL THAT PEOPLE MADE TO HIM.
YOU COULD BE IN SUBURBAN, THE AREA HE REPRESENTS AND SAY I
HAVE A PIPE BUSED AT THE END OF MY STREET AND HE WOULD SHOW UP
WITH CITY STAFF AND HE WOULD FIXIT AND THROUGH THE YEARS HE
DEVELOPED THIS ARMY OF SUPPORTERS.  AND HIS POLITICALMESSAGE IS VERY SIMPLE. IT'S
KEEP TAXES LOW, WE TAKE ENOUGHOF YOUR MONEY. PEOPLE AREWILLING TO OVERLOOK
ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF BECAUSE THEY FEEL HEARD.
THAT'S THE BIG TAKE AWAY.
>> LET HIM BE YOUR COUNTRY'S SUPER.
LET HIM BE THE CONCIERGE, IF YOUWILL.
PEOPLE CAN CALL HIM AND GO ROB, MY SINK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED.  THEN HE COULD COME OVER.
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A CRACK PARTY.
>> IT'S NOT ALL OF TORONTO.  CERTAINLY HIS APPROVAL RATINGS
SHOW HE IS AROUND THE 40s.
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  >> THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY VOTER
INTENTION.  YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE CITY
DOES IN OCTOBER DURING THE ELECTIONS.
>> ALL RIGHT.>> TWO SECONDS, I WANT TO ASK
YOU, ALL RIGHT, "CRAZY TOWN," ONTHE BOOK SHELVES NOW, ROB FORD
STORY.  ROBYN DOOLITTLE, FINE JOB.
