PEED OF NEWS.
FOR MORE ON TODAY'S DIZZYING
EVENTS WE GO OUT TO JOHN OLIVER
IN BOSTON.
QUITE A DAY, JOHN.
>> HI, JOHN.
YES, INDEED.
LOOK A REAL BLACK MARK TO BE
HONEST ON ALL OF US IN THE
NEWS-GATHERING BUSINESS.
ALTHOUGH -- I TOTALLY SHOULDN'T
BE SAYING THIS RIGHT NOW.
THEY DO HAVE JUST MINUTES AGO A
SUSPECT IN CUSTODY WHICH I
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T CONFIRM BUT WILL
SAY.
>> Jon: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
YES, JON, YES.
I'M NOT POSITIVE BUT I CAN SAY
THAT IT IS A DARK-SKINNED MALE,
POSSIBLY WHITE, OR MAYBE A
WOMAN.
IT COULD BE, JON, IT COULD BE A
MANNISH WOMAN OR AN EFFIMINATE
MAN.
I DON'T WANT TO APPEAR RUDE AT
THIS POINT BY ASKING THE
SUSPECT.
YOU KNOW HOW SENSITIVE THESE
INSTINCTS CAN GET.
RIGHT NOW ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M
HEARING IS THAT THE POLICE ARE
JUST WAITING AROUND TO SEE
WHICH...
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I'M SORRY.
>> WHAT'S UP?
Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS, YOU'VE
ALSO BEEN REPORTING ON THE
SCENE.
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING?
>> JON, JON, JON, I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST GETTING WORD THAT ROAD
TESTS HAS BEEN LAID.
>> NO ARREST HAS BEEN MADE.
I'M JUST GETTING THAT IN FROM A
SOURCE.
I CANNOT CONFIRM THE SOURCE.
I WILL SAY THAT SHE IS DARK
SKINNED, POSSIBLY TALL WITH A
CAST ON HER RIGHT WRIST.
>> Jon: JESSICA, DO YOU HAVE ANY
NEWS?
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING.
>> JON, I HEARD IF YOU HAVE SEX
IN THE BLOOD IT DOESN'T COUNT.
JON, SOMEBODY JUST TOLD ME THAT.
>> Jon: I DIDN'T MEAN NEWS ON...
ON THIS WAS FROM A CREDIBLE
SOURCE.
THE GUY IS A GYM TEACHER.
WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN HIM.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON
THE SUSPECT?
>> NO.
I'M HEARING A LOT OF [BLEEP],
JON.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
IRRESPONSIBLE.
AND JUST BLURT IT OUT.
HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
JUST MORE JUDICIOUS TO WAIT THE
FIVE MINUTES IT MIGHT TAKE TO
HAVE THE INFORMATION VERIFIED.
>> JON, CAN YOU JUMP IN HERE?
IT WAS A FAT HISPANIC LADY, JON.
OR WHAT I'M HEARING A DOG ON HIS
HIND LEGS WEARING GLASSES AND A
HAT.
I CANNOT CONFIRM ANY MORE THAN
THAT AT THIS POINT.
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
SAYING THIS BUT LET ME JUST
REITERATE A DOG DRESSED LIKE A
DETECTIVE WALKING LIKE A MAN.
>> REALLY?
THAT IS THE BOMBER.
YOU'RE GOING TO BLAME THIS ON
McGRUFF
>> Jon: THAT IS RIGHT.
JESSICA BRINGS UP A POINT.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE McGRUFF WHO
IS A CRIME-FIGHTING DOG.
>> THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE POINT IS YOU HEARD IT HERE
EXCLUSIVELY AND FIRST
>> Jon: GREAT WORK AGAIN, GUYS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
