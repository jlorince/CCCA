THERE IS OBVIOUSLY ONLY ONESTORY FOR US
TO COVER TONIGHT, THEIMPENDING SHUTDOWN OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THESUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S SPECIAL
PRESENTATION.
â™ª>> FOR THOSE JUST JOINING THE
STORY IN PROGRESS OUR GOVERNMENTIS GOING TO SHUT DOWN IN 57 OF
YOUR EARTH MINUTES.
BECAUSE THE HOUSE REPUBLICANSARE REFUSING TO FUND THE
GOVERNMENT, UNLESS THE REST OFCONGRESS DELAYS IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ALSOKNOWN AS OBAMACARE.
ALSO KNOWN AS THE END OF AMERICAAS WE KNOW IT FOR REASONS NO ONE
IS ABLE TO CLEARLY EXPLAIN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S LET THE HOUSE REPUBLICANSTRY.
>> THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ONLIMITED GOVERNMENT, PERSONALON
RESPONSIBILITY AND CONSENT OFTHE
GOVERNED, BUT OBAMACARE ISBASED ON LIMITLESS GOVERNMENT.
>> WE ARE LEADING ON PROTECTINGHARDWORKING AMERICANS ACROSS
THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE FEELINGTHE OVERREACH FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
>> I COME TO THE FLOOR AS MANYOF US DO TO SPEAK ABOUT, ABOUT
THE INTRUSION INTO A GOD-GIVENAMERICAN FREEDOM CALLED
OBAMACARE.
>> IT IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONALTAKING OF GOD GIVEN AMERICAN
LIBERTY.
>> Jon: THEY ARE JUST THROWINGWORDS TOGETHER.
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKINGS OF GODGIVEN AMERICANS -- IT SOUNDS
LIKE A (BLEEP) OF RANDOMPATRIOTIC BUZZ WORDEES.
>> IF IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, IDIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I KNOW HOWMUCH YOU LOVE THE CONSTITUTION,
NO ONE LOVES THE CONSTITUTIONLIKE YOU GUYS.
>> THE CONSTITUTION IS THEFOUNDATION.
>> A GREAT DOCUMENT, THECONSTITUTION.
>> THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND.
THE GREATEST GOVERNING DOCUMENTTHE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
>> I CARRY A COPY.
>> JUST LOOK AT YOURCONSTITUTION.
WHICH I KEEP IN MY POCKET.
SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE MY POCKET.
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU IT IS INHERE.
>> Jon: HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
I HAVE GOT -- WAIT, THAT IS MYWEED.
I GOT MY WEED.
I GOT A COUPLE OF RUBBERS HERE.
AH.
SON OF A BITCH THAT'S THEMONITOR LIZARD I USE TO GUARD MY
COPY OF THE CONSTITUTION.
I THINK I GOT SOME BAND-AIDS INTHERE, SON OF A BITCH, HE BIT ME
AGAIN!  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? PERHAPS WE CAN LOOK TO THE
CONSTITUTION FOR A SOLUTION TOTHIS CRISIS.
LET ME GET MINE.
SON OF A BITCH!
>> ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.
SO IN 2009 CONGRESS PASSED THEAFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WERE THEY
ALLOWED TO DO THAT?
>> CONGRESS MAY DETERMINE THETIME OF -- ISN'T THERE A CARTOON
THAT EXPLAINS THIS?
>> YES, I'M ONLY A BILL, AND IFTHEY VOTE FOR ME
ON CAPITOL HILL, WELL, THEN, IAM OFF TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE
I WAIT IN A LINE WITH A LOT OFOTHER BILLS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO
SIGN.
AND IF HE SIGNS ME THEN I WILLBE A LAW!
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I JUSTREALIZED, ONE OF THOSE BILLS I
THINK HAD A HARPOON IN ITSCHEST.
LOOK AT THAT.
ONE OF THOSE BILLS IS LIKE INEED A DOCTOR.
ALL RIGHT, SO APPARENTLY THEYARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT, THEY ARE
ALLOWED TO MAKE LAWS AND THEPRESIDENT IS ALLOWED TO SIGN
LAWS AND WHAT DO WE DO IF THOSELAWS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL?
WELL, APPARENTLY NINE PRECOGS INMAGIC
ROBES GOT TOGETHER LOOKED AT THEAFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND DECIDED
IT WAS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
SO EVERYTHING APPEARS TO HAVEBEEN DONE LITERALLY BY THE BOOK.
THIS BILL IS A LAW INVENTED BYTHE SYSTEM THE REPUBLICANS SAY
THETHEY LOVE, BUT TO HEAR THEYREPUBLICANS TELL IT, THE WHOLE
THING COULD BE AVOIDEDIF OBAMA WOULD MEET THEM
HALFWAY.
>> THEY HAVE REFUSED TO EVENCONSIDER THE COMPROMISE WE HAVE
OFFERED.
>> THEY WON'T NEGOTIATE WITH USON ANYTHING.
>> WHAT HAVE THE DEMOCRATSCOMPROMISED ON, NOTHING.
>> HARRY REID WON'T MEET WITHJON BOEHNER, THE PRESIDENT WON'T
MEET WITH JON BOEHNER.
>> THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TOCOMPROMISE ON ANYTHING.
>> THERE IS NO RESOLUTION UNLESSYOU SIT TOGETHER AND BRIDGE THE
DIVIDE.
>> Jon: THE BRIDGE, THERE ISNO DIVIDE TO THE LAW.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: HOW -- NOBODY IS
SAYING IT'S A GOOD LAW, NOBODY'SSAYING IT'S A BAD LAW, IT'S A
LAW.
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HOW THEWORLD WORKS?
DID YOU SEE THE GIANTS GAME ONSUNDAY?  THEY LOST 31 TO SEVEN.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE GIANTSDIDN'T SAY AFTER THAT GAME?  IF
YOU DON'T GIVE US 25 MORE POINTSBY MIDNIGHT ON MONDAY, WE WILL
SHUT DOWN THE (BLEEP) NFL.
THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESSASPIRED TO THE MATURITY AND
PROBLEM SOLVING CAPACITYOF FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
MAN!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: THIS IS UTTER INSANITY.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO GETFRIED FOR THIS ON THE NEWS.
F>> IN THE TUG OF WAR OVER THEBUDGET AND OBAMACARE WILL
PRESIDENT OR REPUBLICANS BLINKFIRST?  NEITHER SIDE LOOKS LIKE
THEY ARE ANYWHERE CLOSE TOCAVING.
>> HEADING TOWARD A GOVERNMENTSHUTDOWN, WHO WILL BLINK FIRST?
>> THERE IS A LOT OF BLAME TO GOAROUND IN WASHINGTON.
>> NEITHER SIDE IS READY TO GIVEAN INCH.
>> WE HAVE A POLITICAL GAME OFCHICKEN WITH A WHOLE LOT RIDING
ON IT.
>> Jon: NO WE DON'T!  I AM ALLFOR A POX ON BOTH OF THEIR
HOUSES WHEN APPROPRIATE BUT THISIS NOT A GAME OF CHICKEN, THIS
IS WHEN SOMEONE IS DRIVING TOWORK AND THERE IS CAR COMING
DIRECTLY AT THEM IN THEIR LANE,THAT IS NOT A GAME OF CHICKEN,
THAT IS A (BLEEP) CAUSING AHEADON COLLISION.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN PUT THIS INANOTHER WAY FOR HOUSE
REPUBLICANS.
>> YOU GET NOTHING!  YOU LOSE! GOOD DAY, SIR!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: YOU KNOW THE
REPUBLICANS WILL HEED THISADVICE.
BECAUSE HE IS A SMALL BUSINESSOWNER.
PERHAPS NOTHING SUMS UP THE SHEER RIDICULOUSNESS OF THIS
SITUATION, THE DEGREE TO WHICHTHE REPUBLICANS HAVE LEFT THE
PLANE OF REASON MORE THAN THISNEW TALKING POINT THAT THEY
THEMSELVES ROLLED OUT THISWEEKEND.
>> THE PRESIDENT WILL NEGOTIATEWITH THE IRANIANS, BUT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE WILL NOTTALK TO THE HOUSE.
>> Jon:.
>> HAVE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY WITHTHE REPUBLICANS AS YOU DO WITH
THE RUSSIANS AND IRANIANS.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS MORE THANWILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH
IRANIANS, I DON'T KNOW WHY HEWOULDN'T BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE
WITH US.
>> Jon: BRRRR, BRRR, BRRR.
>> YOU ARE NOT HELPING YOURSELF.
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT PRESIDENTOBAMA CAN MAKE A DEAL WITH THE
MOST INTRANSIGENT HARD-LINEUNREASONABLE TOTALITARIAN
MULLAHS IN THE WORLD, BUT NOTWITH REPUBLICANS?  MAYBE HE IS
NOT THE PROBLEM.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
