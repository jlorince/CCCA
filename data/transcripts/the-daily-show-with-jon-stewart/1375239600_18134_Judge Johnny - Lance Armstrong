ORDER IN THE COURT.
JASON, WHO IS OUR NEXT
DEFENDANT?
>> JUDGE JOHNNY, OUR NEXT
DEFENDANT IS THE ONLY CYCLIST
ANYONE HASSOR HEARD OF.
HAVING WON THE TOUR DE FRANCE IN
UNPRECEDENTED SEVEN TIMES AFTER
TAKING AN UNPRECEDENT AMOUNT OF
STEROIDS.
HE'S PERHAPS BEST KNOWN FOR
HAVING ONE TOMATO UNDER HIS
CARROT.
HE IS, OF COURSE, NOTED [BLEEP]
LANCE ARMSTRONG.
GOOD LUCK RIDING AWAY FROM THE
JUSTICE THAT JUDGE JOHNNY IS
PEDDLING.
>> John: THANK YOU, JASON.
LANCE ARMSTRONG IS BEING SUED BY
THE D.O.J. FOR $120 MILLION FOR
CHEATING WHEN HE WAS SPONSORED
BY THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE.
THAT'S A TOUGH CHARGE.
WHAT'S ARMSTRONG'S DEFENSE?
>> LANCE ARMSTRONG NOW SAYS THE
POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
HE WAS DOPING.
>> HE'S SAYING, "I LIED.
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT I
LIED."
>> John: WOW.
THAT'S HIS DEFENSE?
THIS GUY HAS GOT A LOT OF BALL.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HE'S PLEADING SO GUILTY IT'S
YOUR FAULT FOR NOT KNOWING HOW
GUILTY HE IS.
IS HE ARGUING ANY MITIGATING
CIRCUMSTANCES?
>> I KNOW IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
PERIOD IN OUR SPORT.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, I CAME,
YOU KNOW, RIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE
MIDDLE OF THAT PERIOD.
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S RIGHT.
THAT IS THE REAL TRAGEDY HERE.
I THINK WE ALL OWE LANCE
ARMSTRONG AN APOLOGY FOR MAKING
HIM WIN SEVEN TOUR DE FRANCES
EARNING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN
THE PROCESS DURING SUCH AN
UNFORTUNATE PERIOD IN THE SPORT
HE CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN.
ALL RIGHT.
ON THE BASIS OF THIS WORLD
RECORD NARCISSISM I FIND THE
DEFENDANT A GIANT DOUCHE.
JASON.
