WHAT WAS THAT.
THAT IS UNUSUAL BUT YOUR RESUMEREFLECTS A FAR MORE EXPERIENCEDINDIVIDUAL.
YOU WENT TO COLLEGE VERY YOUNG.
>> I WENT TO COLLEGE AT 11. BIGNERD.
STILL.
>> Jon: WHERE DID YOU GO TOSCHOOL?
>> BARD COLLEGE.
COME ON GUYS.
>> Jon: NOTHING FOR BARD.
>> AND LAW SCHOOL AT YALE.
>> Jon: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHENYOU WENT TO LAW SCHOOL?
>> I GOT IN AT 16 BUT I TOOKTWO YEARS TO WORK AT
THE U.N.
I DID NOT FINISH MY KEG STANDSWHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD AT 11. AFEW, NOT ENOUGH.
>> Jon: GOING TO WORK AT THEU.N. WAS LIKE YOUR RUMSPRINGER.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: YOU BECAME A RHODESSCHOLAR?
>> I DID.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
>> IF YOU ARE PRETENTIOUS ENOUGHTHEY LET YOU THROUGH THE GATES.
IT'S A COOL GROUP OF PEOPLE.THEY SELECT SORT OF ODDBALLS,TOO.
RACHEL MADDOW IS A RHODESSCHOLAR.
IT'S COUNTER CULTURE ENOUGH THATI ADMIRE THAT AS A CREDENTIAL.
>> Jon: HOW WERE YOU SELFPOSSESSED ENOUGH TO BE A HIGH
ACHIEVER IN THAT REGARD?
WERE YOU ALWAYS CIVIC-MINDED ASA -- OBVIOUSLY -- I DON'T WANT
TO THROW THE WORD PRODIGY AROUNDBUT GOING TO COLLEGE AT 11 IS
PRETTY SPECIAL UNLESS YOU AREGOING TO BE AN MD AND HAVE A HITSERIES.
>> I AM THE TYPE OF LAWYER THATIS PROBABLY A FAILED DOCTOR.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> I SAW ORGANIC CHEMISTRY ANDWAS LIKE NOPE GOING TO LAW
SCHOOL.
>> Jon: AT THAT POINT IT COULDHAVE GONE EITHER WAY?
>> YEAH, I DID HAVE THISENGRAINED SENSE OF GOT TO GO
INTO SOME KIND OF PUBLIC SERVICEAND IN ADDITION TO WATCHING
NETFLIX TRIED TO GIVE BACKSOMETHING.
I HAVE THE HAMMY HOLLYWOODBACKGROUND.
A LOT OF THAT WAS TELLINGSTORIES.
GOING INTO THE INSIDE ANDTHRASHING OUT TO GREAT
FRUSTRATION
THE WORK I DID IN AFGHANISTAN.
I WAS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENTFOR A WHILE.
NO ONE LEAVES THAT KIND OF AROLE AND THAT KIND OF PLACE
FEELING TOTALLY SATISFIED WHATTHEY'VE DONE.
IT'S A BIG MACHINE TO WORK IN.
COMING OUT LIKE THIS OF THAT ANDTRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FROMTHE
OUTSIDE MADE SENSE AT THE NEXTSTEP.
>> Jon: IT'S INTERESTING TO MEBECAUSE FROM A YOUNG AGE ONE OF
THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS TOINFUSE IN PEOPLE, NOT THIS
GENERATION, JUST YOUNGPEOPLE IS A SENSE OF EMPATHY AND
A LARGER WORLD.
A PERSPECTIVE THAT IS MOREMACRO AND LESS NARCISSISTIC.
I THINK IT'S NATURAL. SO TO
DEVELOP IT AS A YOUNG AGE I WASCURIOUS IF IT WAS INHERENT YOU
ALWAYS FELT THAT.
YOUR FAMILY IS MORE SOCIALLYACTIVE.
>> I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I GREW UPIN A CRAZY FAMILY.
14 OF US AND ALL DIFFERENT RACESAND SPEAKING SIX DIFFERENT
LANGUAGES.
STANDARD NUCLEAR FAMILY.
>> Jon: SO YOU HAD EXPERIENCEBEING AT THE U.N.
>> RIGHT.
OR LIKE A UNITED COLORS OFBENETTON AD.
FAMILY PHOTOS ENTERTAINING.
MY SIBLINGS WERE ADOPTED FROMREALLY TOUGH BACKGROUNDS FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
PHYSICAL DISABILITIES, MENTALDISABILITIES.
IT GAVE ME A DESIRE TODEFINITELY NOT HAVE 14 KIDS
RIGHT AWAY.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> BUT ALSO TO TRY TO GIVE BACKIN A LESSER WAY BECAUSE I MAY BE
LESS AWESOME BUT WANT TO BE OFSOME USE.
>> Jon: THE SHOW ITSELF DO YOUSEE IT AS -- HAVE YOU WATCHED A
LOT OF CABLE NEWS AND THOUGHTOH, YEAH, I COULD WATCH -- I
COULD GET PEOPLE TO FIGHT INFRONT OF ME.
I COULD DO THAT.
>> YOUR TIRADES AGAINST CABLENEWS ARE EXACTLY WHAT CABLE NEWS
NEEDS.
>> Jon: THAT'S KIND OF YOU TOSAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THE NICE THING IS HOW WELL THEY
LISTEN.
THEY REALLY TONED THEIR ACTSDOWN.
>> QUALITY UNBIASED REPORTINGALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW, I THINK AREBRIGHT SPOTS. THERE ARE SOME
EXAMPLES I HAVE LEARNED A LOTFROM.
I'M GOING INTO THIS NOT KNOWINGHOW TO DO CABLE NEWS.
I LEARNED A LOT WATCHING YOURSHOW.
>> Jon: LORD HELP YOU.
>> EVEN THOUGH IT'S A COMEDYCONTEXT AND I'M DOING A NEWSSHOW
ON A SERIOUS NEWS NETWORK.
OH, COME ON.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THEY'VE SEEN THE SHOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]MEANWHILE ALL I'M DOING IS
EATING SUBWAY SANDWICHES.
>> BUT DO YOU BUILD IN A BODY OFREPORTING.
FOR ME WHEN I LOOK AT THELANDSCAPE OF CABLE NEWS I SEE
YES SOME GOOD REPORTING BUT THEGOOD STORIES LEAVE YOU AT THE
SIDE OF ROAD AFTERWARDS.
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEINFORMATION? MY GENERATION WANTSTHE EXTRA STEP IF I HAVE
TEN MINUTES AND I GIVE A CRAPABOUT THIS STORY, WHAT DO I DO?
MY IDEA WITH THIS SHOW ISMOBILIZE PEOPLE.
GIVE PEOPLE -- EVERYONE HAS ACALL TO ACTION.
WE'LL INTRODUCE TO YOU A STORYMAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
GIVE YOU A MENU OF THINGS.
ON ONE SIDE OF ISSUE, IF YOU'REON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE AWAY TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
WE'LL TRACK OVER THE COURSE OFTHE WEEK WHAT ARE YOUR
RESPONSES?
>> IT'S A PERSPECTIVE THATHASN'T BEEN SEEN AT ALL ON CABLE
NEWS.
I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTINGAND I'M INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED
RIGHT NOW BUT I'M PROBABLY NOTGOING TO VOLUNTEER FOR ANYTHING.
MY GENERATION.
>> WE'LL GET YOU HOLDING UP ASIGN.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO GETOUT THERE?
SON OF A BITCH.
I CAN DO THIS.
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
STARTS MONDAY.
>> MONDAY 1:00 P.M. EASTERN TIMEMSNBC.
>> Jon: THIS WEEKEND YOU AREWATCHING PROBABLY LOCKUP.
