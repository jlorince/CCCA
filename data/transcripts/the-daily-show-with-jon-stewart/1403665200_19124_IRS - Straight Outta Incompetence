>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW.
OH, IT'S GOOD SHOW.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, JENNIFERESPOSITO.
SHE'S AN ACTRESS, BUT ALSO SHE'SGOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HER
BOOK. SHE'S GOT WHAT DO YOU CALLIT THERE, CELIAC DISEASE.
IT'S NAMED AFTER A BALLPLAYER,LOU CELIAC.
PLAYED FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES.
[LAUGHTER]BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, FOR MOST OF
ITS EXISTENCE, THE IRS WASAMERICA'S FAVORITE GOVERNMENT
AGENCY.
[LAUGHTER]BUT THAT ALL CHANGED AFTER THE
IRS ADMITTED LAST YEAR TOCERTAIN IMPROPRIETIES.
>> TEA PARTY AND OTHERCONSERVATIVE GROUPS THAT ROSE TO
POWER EARLY IN THE PRESIDENT'SFIRST TERM WERE UNFAIRLY
TARGETED FOR SPECIAL SCRUTINY BYTHE I.R.S.
>> Jon: BY THE WAY,WHATEVER YOU THINK OF THE
TEA PARTY MOVEMENT, ITHINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT
THE ONLY GOVERNMENT AGENCY THATSHOULD BE SINGLING
IT OUT FOR SPECIAL SCRUTINY ISTHE FASHION POLICE.
I MEAN, PANTALOONS?COME ON. COME ON. PANTALOONS?
THAT IS SO "BENAJMIN FRUMPLIN."WELL ANYWAY, SINCE THEN IT HAS
BEEN ESTABLISHED THE IRS ALSOTARGETED LIBERAL 501C-4s
BUT NOT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OFSCRUTINY THAT THEY
APPLIED TO THE CONSERVATIVES.SO, THAT'S SOMETHING.
NOW, I KNOW THE RIGHT WANTS THATSOMETHING TO BE THAT PRESIDENT
OBAMA ORDERED THE IRS TO TARGETTHEM WHILE HE SAT IN A DARK ROOM
SMOKING A CIGAR, STROKING ACAT, WHILST AN ORPHAN BOY STANDS
OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN, LOOKINGTHROUGH THE WINDOW SAYING, "WHY?
WHY, MR. PRESIDENT?
WHY."
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE'SBEEN NO REAL EVIDENCE FOUND THAT
THE WHITE HOUSE IS INVOLVED ANDTHE CAT TURNED OUT TO BE A DOG
AND THE ORPHAN ACTUALLY HASPARENTS AND WAS PUTTING ON A
BRITISH ACCENT. BUTTHE POINT IS THIS.
THESE IRS TROUBLES DO NOT APPEARTO BE THAT.
BUT THEY ARE SOMETHING.
AND THE IRS IS CLEARLY DOINGTHEIR BEST TO CONTINUE TO GIVE
OFF SCANDAL STINK LIKE SOME KINDOF SCARED SCANDAL SKUNK.
[LAUGHTER]WHEN WE LAST LEFT THE IRS, THEIR
OFFICIAL, LOIS LERNER, HAD TAKENTHE FIFTH, RATHER THAN TESTIFY,
IN FRONT OF CONGRESS,SO CONGRESS ASKED THE IRS IF
THEY WOULD BE SO KIND AS TOCLICK THE FORWARD BUTTON ON ALL
OF LOIS LERNER'S E-MAILS.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?
>> THEY SAY THE IRS HAS BEENPROMISING TO GET THEM THESE
E-MAILS FOR A YEAR, AND NOWSUDDENLY SAYS THAT LOIS
LERNER'S COMPUTER CRASHED WAYBACK IN 2011 AND THAT MANY OF
THOSE E-MAILS ARE JUST GONE.
>> WELL, THAT'S IRRITATING.
COMPUTERS DO CRASH.
E-MAILS ARE LOST, BUT TYPICALLYFINDING THAT OUT, THAT
INFORMATION, TAKES LESS TIMETHAN IT TAKES TO GESTATE A
MANATEE.
[LAUGHTER]A YEAR?
COME ON!
WELL, FIRST CONGRESS HAD TO FILLOUT FORM 1218A SUB E-Z.
THAT'S AN E-MAIL REQUISITIONFORM FOR OUR RECORDS.
THEN WE THROW THAT FORM INTO AROOM FILLED WITH CHIMPS.
THEN...
[LAUGHTER]THEN WHAT WE DID IS WE TRAINED
THE CHIMPS TO READ.
[LAUGHTER]SO THINGS WERE LOOKING GOOD.
THAT'S WHEN, UNFORTUNATELY, THECHIMPS UNIONIZED.
SO THAT WAS A WHOLE THING.
BUT FINALLY WE NEGOTIATED ACONTRACT.
FINALLY WE DELIVERED A CONTRACTTHE CHIMPS DIDN'T THROW THEIR
FECES AT.
THE POINT IS E-MAILREQUISITIONS ARE NOW DONE
THROUGH A DIFFERENT FORM, SO IFYOU COULD REAPPLY, ET CETERA, ET
CETERA, ET CETERA.
SO IT IS IN THIS ENVIRONMENTTHAT THE NEW IRS COMMISSIONER
JOHN...REALLY? YOU LIKE THAT?
THE NEW IRS COMMISSIONER,JOHN KOSKINEN,
KOS-KINE-N, KOSKINENI'LL GO WITH, HE COMES BEFORE
CONGRESS TO TESTIFY.
I WONDER IF THEY'RE GOING TO BEDICKS TO HIM.
>> PLEASE RISE TO TAKE THE OATH.
AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.
A LITTLE HIGHER.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WOW.
THAT WAS EASY.
NOW TURN AROUND AND WIGGLE.SERIOUSLY THOUGH,
WHILE WE ALL MIGHT WANT TO DOTHAT TO THE HEAD OF THE IRS,
WHAT DOES RAISING YOUR HANDHIGHER HAVE TO DO WITH TELLING
THE TRUTH?
UH, I CAN LIE.
WAIT, I CAN LIE.
HOLD ON.
I CAN LIE.
I CAN LIE.
I CAN LIE.
I CAN NO LONGER LIE!
FOR MY HAND IS TOO CLOSE TO GOD.
THAT'S HIM SCRATCHING GOD'SBEARD.
HELLO!
BUT, ALRIGHT.
ENOUGH CATHARTIC PUBLIC SHAMING.
WHERE ARE THE DAMN E-MAILS?
>> THE ACTUAL HARD DRIVE, AFTERIT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS
DYSFUNCTIONAL AND THAT WITHEXPERTS NO E-MAILS COULD BE
RETRIEVED WAS RECYCLED ANDDESTROYED IN THE NORMAL
PROCESS.
>> SO WAS IT PHYSICALLYDESTROYED?
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.
>> SO WAS IT MELTED DOWN, DO YOUKNOW?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THERECYCLER DOES WITH IT.
>> Jon: FOR ALL I KNOW LOISLERNER'S HARD DRIVE WAS GROUND
INTO A FINE DUST, SPRINKLED LIKEPARMESAN ONTO A LASAGNA THAT WAS
SERVED TO THOSE IN THIS VERYCHAMBER.
[LAUGHTER]SO I SAY TO YOU, CONGRESS, IF
YOU WANT TO SEE ALL OF LOISLERNER'S E-MAILS, YOU MUST LOOK
INSIDE YOURSELVES.
OR, OR YOU COULD... OR YOU COULDWAIT.
BY THE WAY, THAT IS A KILLERTHAT GUY IMPRESSION.
THAT I WILL USE FOR THE REST OFMY CAREER.
[LAUGHTER]SO UP UNTIL NOW, THE WHOLE THING
IS ANNOYING.
BUT NOT QUITE GALLING.
HERE'S WHERE IT GETS SOMEWHATGALLING.
>> THE IRS HAS HISTORICALLY ONLYPRESERVED BACK-UP TAPES FOR SIX
MONTHS.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY WHOSE
ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ONFORCING AMERICANS TO LIVE AS
BORDERLINE HOARDERS...
[LAUGHTER]ONLY KEEPS THEIR [BLEEPED] FOR
SIX MONTHS?
NO.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NO, THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER GET A NOTICEFROM THE IRS SAYING PLEASE BRING
YOUR RECORDS DOWN TO US... IFYOU CAN FIND THEM.
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE IF THEE.P.A. WAS DUMPING ITS OFFICE
TRASH IN THE NATIONAL ZOO'SSPOTTED OWL EXHIBIT.
[LAUGHTER]MEANING IT WOULD BE IRONIC.
BUT EVEN IF THE IRS DELETED THETAPES, WHY CAN'T THEY JUST GET
THE E-MAILS FROM HER INBOX.
SPOILER ALERT: IT'S STUPID ANDPREVENTABLE.
EACH IRS EMPLOYEE'S E-MAIL BOXBACK THEN ONLY HELD 150
MEGABYTES OF INFORMATION.
ALSO KNOWN AS FIVE PICTURES OFYOUR FAMILY.
OR ONE PICTURE OF ANTHONYWEINER'S [BLEEPED].
BOOM!
BOOM!
[BLEEPED][BLEEPED] YEAH.
HE HAS A SOMEWHAT LARGE PENIS.
150 MEGABYTES.
THAT'S 1% OF WHAT GMAIL OFFERSYOU FOR FREE.
AND THAT COMES WITH A GOOGLEPLUS ACCOUNT FOR YOU TO NOT USE.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BUILT AN
ENTIRE COMPLEX IN THE DESERTSOF UTAH TO STORE EVERYTHING
AMERICANS HAVE EVERSAID TO EACH OTHER.
BUT INTERGOVERNMENTCONVERSATIONS?
[LAUGHTER]I DON'T KNOW.
BUY A [BLEEPED] THUMB DRIVE.
IF THERE IS A LARGER SCANDALHERE, IT'S THAT OUR GOVERNMENT'S
HANDLING OF INFORMATION ACROSSALL PLATFORMS BORDERS ON
CRIMINAL IDIOCY.
THE IRS IS FRYING HARD DRIVES,THE V.A. IS DROWNING IN PAPER.
IS THERE ANY RECORD KEEPINGMEDIUM THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD
USE THAT COULD WORK FOR THEM?
MICROFICHE?
WE'LL DO IT.
STONE TABLETS?
WE'LL DO IT.
WE COULD TAKE A PAGE OUT OF THEANCIENT GREEKS.
WEAVE ALL OF OUR IMPORTANTINFORMATION INTO AN EPIC POEM
AND RECITED ENTIRELYFROM MEMORY, PASSED DOWN
OVER GENERATIONS AS PART OFA FEDERAL ARCHIVAL ORAL
TRADITION FROM BARD TOAPPRENTICE, BUT YOU'D PROBABLY
LOSE THAT [BLEEPED] PAGE.
UNLESS, WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOWWHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
YOU'RE TIRED OF GOVERNING US,AREN'T YOU?
AND SO YOU'RE KIND OF ACTINGLIKE ASSHOLES SO WE BREAK UP
WITH YOU.
WELL, LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE NOTPERFECT AS CONSTITUENTS AND
WE'VE BEEN IN THIS RELATIONSHIPFOR 200 YEARS, PROBABLY TAKE YOU
A LITTLE BIT FOR GRANTED.
WE WANT EVERYTHING AND DON'TWANT TO PAY FOR ANYTHING.
[LAUGHTER]EVERY YEAR ON YOUR BIRTHDAY WE
THROW A HUGE PARTY ANDPRETEND IT'S FOR YOU,
BUT IT'S REALLY JUST A CHANCEFOR US TO GET [BLEEPED] UP
AND STARE AT THE SKY BETWEEN9:00 P.M. AND 9:25.
LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS,GOVERNMENT.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU GET RIGHT,WE'RE STILL GOING TO FIND THAT
ONE THING YOU GOT WRONG AND SIGNA PETITION ABOUT IT.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T NEEDYOU, BABY.
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS:JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TOTALLY
UNREASONABLE DOESN'T MEAN YOUHAVE TO BE TOTALLY INCOMPETENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
