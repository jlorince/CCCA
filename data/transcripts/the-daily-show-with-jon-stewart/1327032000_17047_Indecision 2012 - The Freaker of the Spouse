( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: BOOM, HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE-- YES,
ALL RIGHT.
SOMEONE JUST SNEEZED.
MY GUEST FROM THE MOVIE "MAN
ON THE LEDGE" ELIZABETH
BANKS IS GOING TO JOIN US
LATER TONIGHT, BUT SOME OF
WE WANT TO GET TO TONIGHT.
YES, PLEASE, INDULGE YOUR
APPLAUSE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: SO MUCH TO GET TO
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO DIVE
RIGHT IN.
A FEW WEEKS AGO SPUNKY YOUNG
UPSTART HEARD THE PEM'S CALL
AND DECIDED TO EXPLORE THE
POSSIBILITY OF JOINING THE
RACE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF SOUTH
CAROLINA.
AND!
WHEN HE DID, EVERYTHING
CHANGED.
>> THE POLL SHOWS OBAMA AT
41%, ROMNEY AT 38%, THIS IS
P-- POLL AND COLBERT AT 13%.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: 13%, 13%, 13% AFTER
A WEEK.
1 WEEK.
AT THIS RATE, SHOULD HE
DECIDE TO RUN WE CAN PROJECT
RIGHT NOW STEPHEN COLBERT
WILL WIN IN NOVEMBER WITH
546% OF THE VOTE.
(APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN COLBERT.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
POWERFUL STORY, COMMON SENSE
APPROACH TO HARDWORKING
FAMILIES.
BUT MOSTLY TO A SALVO OF
DEVASTATING ADS CRAFTED BY
HIS MASTERFULLY RUN
SUPERPAC.
I'M SURE STEPHEN HIMSELF
WOULD THANK THIS ADROIT
ORGANIZATION IF HE COULD, IF
ONLY HE COULD COMMUNICATE
WITH THIS SUPERPAC DIRECTLY
WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T.
BUT IF HE COULD HE--
(LAUGHTER)
HOW POWERFUL IS COLBERT'S
INFLUENCE BEEN ON THIS RACE?
SINCE COLBERT THREATENED TO
GET NOT RACE OTHER
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN JUMPING
OVERBOARD LIKE AN ITALIAN
CRUISE SHIP CAPTAIN.
YOU HEARD ME.
E MY, THAT'S SO TOPICAL.
FIRST HUNTSMAN AND THEN THIS
MORNING.
>> THERE IS NO VIABLE PATH
FORWARD FOR ME IN THIS 2012
CAMPAIGN.
THEREFORE TODAY, MI
SUSPENDING MY CAMPAIGN AND
ENDORSING NEWT GINGRICH FOR
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: AND THEN, AND THEN
THERE WAS, AND THEN THERE
WAS A THIRD THING I WAS
GOING TO DO AND--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OH [BLEEP] I DON'T
NEED TO REMEMBER ANY MORE.
I AIN'T RUNNING FOR [BLEEP]
PEWW, PEWW, I PULLED A
MUSCLE.
SO AT 11:16 A.M., THAT'S
WHEN PERRY MADE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT, IT LOOKED LIKE
CLEAR SKY FORCE NEWT
GINGRICH IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
WHAT HAPPENED AT 11:19 A.M.?
>> IT'S NOT ALL CLEAR SKIES
AHEAD FOR NEWT GINGRICH.
ABC IS SET TO AIR AN
INTERVIEW WITH GINGRICH'S
EX-WIFE MARYANN.
>> THAT'S NEVER A GOOD
THING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YES, RICK PERRY'S
ENDORSEMENT OF NEWT GINGRICH
GAVE THE FORMER SPEAKER A
THREE MINUTE RESPITE FROM
THE NEWS THAT GINGRICH'S
EX-WIFE WAS ABOUT TO GO
DIVORCE COURT ON HIS ASS.
THREE MINUTES, GINGRICH
BARELY HAD TIME TO HAVE A
VICTORY AFFAIR.
STILL, IT'S NOT SURPRISING
THAT NEWT'S EX-WIFE IS NOT A
FAN OF HIS.
>> IT'S BEEN LONG REPORTED
THAT GINGRICH DISCUSSED HIS
DIVORCE FROM HIS FIRST WIFE
WHILE SHE WAS RECOVERING
FROM CANCER SURGERY.
>> SHE WAS THE SECOND
MRS. GINGRICH.
>> Jon: OH.
OH, IT'S THE SECOND OF HIS
THREE WIVES.
MARYANN, THE JAN BRADY OF
MRS. BEGINNING ITCHES.
THE MEAT IN HIS WIFE HOAGIE,
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK OF
HIS WIVES.
WHO IT ENDS KIND OF SAD BUT
IN RETROSPECT IS REALLY THE
BEST ONE IN SOME RESPECTS.
WELL, AT LEAST I CAN'T
IMAGINE MARYANN HAD AS BIG A
BEEF WITH THE FORMER SPEAKER
THEN AS HIS FIRST WIFE.
>> IN THE CASE OF MARYANN,
SHE JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HE
WAS THERE AND TOLD DON'T PUT
ANY STRESS ON MARYANN,.
>> AND THEN HE ASKED FOR A
DIVORCE.
>> YES.
>> FIRST WIFE CANCER, SECOND
WIFE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, CAN
NEWT GINGRICH BE
RECLASSIFIED AS A POLLUTANT?
OF COURSE, THE GUY IS LIKE
THE DIOXIN OF HUSBANDS.
>> WE'D BEEN MARRIED A LONG
TIME.
AND HE SAID YES, BUT YOU
WANT ME ALL TO YOURSELF.
CALISTA DOESN'T CARE WHAT I
DO.
>> WHAT WAS HE SAYING TO YOU,
DO YOU THINK?
>> HE WAS ASKING TO HAVE AN
OPEN MARRIAGE.
AND I REFUSED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I THINK I'M GOING TO
BE SICK.
AND THEN NEWT WILL LEAVE ME.
STILL--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: AS DISTURBING AS THE
OPEN MARRIAGE REVELATION IS,
THE OPEN MARRIAGE REVELATION
IS IN KEEPING WITH NEWT'S
PHILOSOPHY, HE'S A FREE
MARKET MAN, HE'S JUST
ENCOURAGING COMPETITION,
CREATIVE DESTRUCTION, PRO
CREATIVE DESTRUCTION.
