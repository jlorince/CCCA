>> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, MYGUEST TONIGHT RESEARCH
PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION ATNYU ALSO AN AUTHOR, HER
LATEST BOOK IS CALLEDREIGN OF ERROR THE HOAX OF
THE PRIVATIZATION AND DANGERTO AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL,
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, DIANE RAVITCH.
>> HELLO.
>> THANK YOU.
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> GREAT, THANK YOU.
WONDERFUL.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> WONDERFUL, WAS LAUGHINGMY HEAD OFF AT THE EARLIER
SEGMENT, LOVED IT.
>> REALLY QUITE AMUSING, WEARE.
WE WORK ON THAT FOR AT LEASTAN HOUR AND A HALF A DAY.
>> REIGN OF ERROR THE HOAXOF THE PRIVATIZATION
MOVEMENT AND DANGER TOAMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
FOR ME THE MOST SURPRISINGTHING IN THE BOOK IS YOU
SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME,ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT
WE MAKE IN THIS COUNTRY ISTHAT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.
YOU MAKE THE CASE HERE THATIS NOT CORRECT.
>> ACTUALLY, NO, IT'S NOTTRUE AT ALL.
WHAT I DID WAS TO LOOK ATALL THE DATA AND I FOUND OUT
THAT THE TEST SCORES TODAYARE THE HIGHEST EVER IN
HISTORY.
GRADUATION RATES HIGHESTEVER IN HISTORY.
DROPOUT RATES LOWEST EVER INHISTORY AND I CAME TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT KIDS TODAYARE, IN FACT, THE SMARTEST
GENERATION YET.
>> Jon: -- (APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHAT IT SEEMS TOSPEAK TO THOUGH, IS THAT
LIKE WEALTH INEQUALITY THEREIS AN EDUCATION INEQUALITY.
BECAUSE THAT IS ANAMORTIZATION, I WOULD
IMAGINE.
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TESTTEST SCORES AND GRADUATION
RATE YET IT'S CLEAR THATTHERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS.
>> OH, YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT ARE REALLYSTRUGGLING.
>> THERE ARE-- I MEAN THESINGLE BIGGEST SOURCE
OF LOW ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT ISPOVERTY,
AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATEOF CHILD POVERTY AMONGST ALL
THE ADVANCED NATIONS OF THEWORLD.
THERE WAS A REPORT-- .
>> Jon: SO WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
>> WE ARE NUMBER ONE, NUMBERONE IN CHILD POVERTY.
AND WE NOW HAVE ABOUT HALFOF OUR STATES WHERE HALF THE
KIDS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY,FOR A RICH COUNTRY THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.
>> Jon: ALSO PEOPLE HAVE ANIMPRESSION THAT THIS IS AN
INNER CITY ISSUE.
AND IT IS NOT.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS,PEOPLE VIEW IT AS MIDDLE
CLASS OR BLUE COLLAR, THOSEAREAS WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE,
THEY HAVE FOOD INSECURITY,THEY HAVE DIFFICULTIES AS
WELL.
THIS IS A VERY WIDE SPREADISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO
EDUCATION, YES?
>> WELL, IT'S ACTUALLYFOCUSED ON WHEREVER THERE IS
POVERTY THERE ARE LOW TESTSCORES
LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE.
KIDS ARE SICK, KIDS DON'TMAKE IT TO SCHOOL AS OFTEN.
THEIR ATTENTION ISDISTRACTED BECAUSE OF ALL
THE HUGE PROBLEMS, EMOTIONALAND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OF
THEIR LIVES.
>> UH-HUH.
>> AND YET THESE PEOPLEWHO CALL THEMSELVES
REFORMERS SAY DON'T PAYATTENTION TO THAT.
THAT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THEROOM.
THAT IS WHAT WE MUST PAYATTENTION TO.
I MEAN IF YOU REALLY CAREABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION IN
AMERICA, WE WOULD HAVESMALLER CLASS SIZES.
PARTICULARLY FOR KIDS WHOARE POOR.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: .
>> WE WOULD MAKE SURE THATEVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA HAD
EVERY DAY A NURSE OR HEALTHCLINIC THAT KID COULD GO TO
WHEN THEY WERE SICK.
WE WOULD MAKE SURE THATEVERY SCHOOL HAD THE ARTS,
THAT EVERY SCHOOL HADPHYSICAL EDUCATION, THAT
CHILDREN WHO GO TO-- .
>> Jon: THESE AREAS, SO THEFAMILIES IN THESE AREAS,
BECAUSE THIS GETS INTOANOTHER ISSUE THAT YOU BRING
UP IN THE BOOK.
THE FAMILIES IN THIS AREAARE RIGHTLY CONCERNED,
THOUGH, WITH THE PERFORMANCEOF SOME OF THE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS IN THEIR AREAS.
THESE SCHOOLS CAN BEDILAPIDATED, POORLY
PERFORMING AND THESE TYPESOF THINGS.
THERE IS THIS MOVEMENT ANDTHE CHARTER MOVEMENT THAT
SAYS WHAT'S WRONG WITHGIVING CHOICE TO THOSE KIDS
IN THOSE AREAS, BECAUSE THESCHOOLS AROUND THEM ARE NOT
SERVING THEIR NEEDS, WHAT ISWRONG WITH THAT IN YOUR
MIND?
>> WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITHIT IS THAT IT IS PART OF, I
BELIEVE, A PURPOSEFUL EFFORTTO CREATE A CONSUMER
MENTALITY AROUND EDUCATION.
PUBLIC EDUCATION IS A PUBLICRESPONSIBILITY.
WHETHER YOU SEND YOURCHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS
OR TO RELIGIOUS SCHOOL ORYOU HOME SCHOOL THEM, THAT'S
YOUR RIGHT.
AND IF YOU HAVE NO CHILDRENAT ALL, YOU'RE STILL
OBLIGATED TO SUPPORT PUBLICEDUCATION.
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DOIS TO SAY THAT PUBLIC
EDUCATION IS NOT PUBLIC,IT'S A CHOICE, IT'S A
CONSUMER CHOICE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROYTHE SENSE OF CIVIC
OBLIGATION SO THE NEXTTIME-- .
>> Jon: TURN IT INTO AMARKETPLACE.
>> EXACTLY.
SO THE NEXT TIME A BOND ISSUEIS UP YOU WILL SAY WELL, I
DON'T HAVE A CHILD IN SCHOOL. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR
THE BOND ISSUE.
WE'RE GOING TO DESTROYPUBLIC EDUCATION THAT WAY.
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK, YOUKNOW, IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO
MOST PARENTS THEY WOULD SAYTHE BIGGEST BANE OF THEIR
EXISTENCE IS THIS NEW, YOUKNOW, CORE CURRICULUM THAT
IS BEING TESTED.
BUT THEY WOULD ALSO SAYTENURE IS ALSO A PROBLEM,
THE TEACHERS UNION IS TOORIGID, DO YOU ALSO ADMIT
THAT THERE CAN BE REFORM INTHAT AREA AS WELL?
THAT THAT CAN WORK TOGETHER?
>> WELL, LET ME SAY THAT I'MPROBABLY THE BIGGEST CRITIC
OF THE STATUS QUO.
I DON'T LIKE THE STATUS QUO.
THE STATUS QUO TODAY IS TEST,TEST, TEST, PRETEST, POST
TEST, DATA, KIDS ARE NOTLOOKED AT AS INDIVIDUALS,
THEY'RE LOOKED AT AS DATAPOINTS.
I THINK IT'S ALL WRONG.
I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF YOULOOK ON YOUR SCHOOL, YOU GO
SHOPPING AND PICK YOURSCHOOL THE WAY YOU PICK YOUR
SHOES OR YOUR AUTOMOBILE.
THAT IS WRONG TOO.
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A GOODNEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL AND
EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD.
ONE WHERE THEY ARE VERYHAPPY TO SEND THEIR KIDS
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THETEACHERS ARE TERRIFIC.
THE FUNNY THING IS IF YOULOOK AT WHOLE DATA FROM
GALLUP WHAT IT SHOWS ISPEOPLE ARE ASKED HOW IS
AMERICAN EDUCATION DOING.
THEY HAVE HEARD 30 YEARS OFAMERICAN EDUCATION IS BROKEN,
IT DOESN'T WORK, IT'SOBSOLETE.
SO THEY AMERICAN PUBLICEDUCATION NO GOOD.
HOW IS YOUR SCHOOL, YOURNEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL.
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBORHOODSCHOOL IS TERRIFIC.
MY TEACHERS ARE GREAT. ILOVE MY TEACHERS.
>> Jon: IT LIKE CONGRESS,YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT THE SAME
WAY.
MY CONGRESSMAN IS OKAY BUTTHE INSTITUTION-- DO YOU
HAVE TIME TO STICK AROUND.
WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK ALITTLE BIT MORE, REIGN OF
ERROR ON THE BOOK SHELVESNOW, DIANE RAVITCH.
WE'LL COME BACK WITH A LITTLEMORE
