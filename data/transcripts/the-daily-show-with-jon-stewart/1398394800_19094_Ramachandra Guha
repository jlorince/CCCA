[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST
TONIGHT, ANAUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS "GANDHI
BEFORE INDIA," PLEASE WELCOMERAMACHANDRA GUHA.
HELLO, SIR.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THIS IS -- HERE IS WHAT I LOVE.
THIS IS THE BOOK, GANDHI BEFOREINDIA.
WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH ANICONIC FIGURE, A FIGURE THAT
BELONGS TO THE AGES, TO BRING APERSPECTIVE TO IT THAT IS
VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN TO MANY PEOPLEWHO BELIEVE THEY KNOW HIM WELL.
I BELIEVE I KNOW GANDHI, YOU SAYGANDHI I HAVE ALL OF THESE
THINGS I THINK I KNOW.
>> YES.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. THIS IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO
READ ABOUT HIM IN HIS YOUNGERLIFE.
>> YES.
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, JON,NEVER TO TRUST YOUR SUBJECT'S
AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
YOU KNOW, EVEN A GUY AS FAMOUSAS GANDHI, I MEAN YOU WRITE YOUR
MEMOIRS?
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> YOUR BIOGRAPHER WOULD SAY,THIS IS A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE
AGAINST ME. YOU HAVE GOT TO STOPIT.
>> Jon: I SEE.
>> NOW, GANDHI HAS WRITTEN ABOUTHIS LIFE, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE
WRITTEN ABOUT GANDHI'S LIFEBASED ON GANDHI'S WRITINGS.
BUT WHAT I TRIED TO DO WAS TOLOOK AT PERSPECTIVES THAT GO
BEYOND HIM, WHATPEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT HIM,
IN SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE THEWHITE NEWSPAPERS,
NOT -- IN A NOT DISSIMILARMANNER TO THE NEVADA NEWSPAPERS
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT,WROTE VERY VICIOUS THINGS ABOUT
HIM. YOU KNOW, SATIRICALFUNNY POEMS. YOU KNOW,
THEY WERE HIS FRIENDS, HISRIVALS. SO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE
SAYING AMOUNT GANDHI, LETTERS,DOCUMENTS CAN ILLUMINATE HIS
LIFE, HIS EARLY FORMATION, HISVIEWS, MUCH BETTER THAN HE IS
REMEMBERED OR DARE I SAY ITMISREMEMBERED MEMORIES OF HIS
EARLY LIFE.
>> Jon: BUT THAT IS WHAT ISSO FASCINATING.
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT WHAT YOUBROUGHT TO THIS IS CONTEXT
BECAUSE AS YOU LIONIZE ANINDIVIDUAL THEY BEGIN TO NARROW.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: IN OUR MEMORY.
AND YOU FORGET, YOU KNOW, IT ISLIKE WHEN I LOOK AT A BLACK AND
WHITE PICTURE.
I FORGET, OH THAT JACKET COULDBE BRIGHT GREEN, THAT HAT COULD
BE YELLOW.
YOU FORGET THAT PEOPLE LIVEDTHEIR LIVES IN COLOR.
>> INDEED.
>> AND THEY LIVE THIER LIVES INRELATIONSHIPS. YOU TALKED
ABOUT LIONIZE, YOU KNOW, I'VETRIED TO HUMANIZE GHANDI.
>> Jon: YES.
>> GANDHI WAS ORTHODOX HINDUPATRIARCH. AND HE WAS MADE MORE
SENSITIVE TO GENDER RIGHTS BY AREMARKABLE WOMAN SECRETARY HE
HAD, A JEWISH WOMAN CALLED SONJASCHLESIN. YOU KNOW,
HE WAS AN UPPER CASTE HINDU BUTIN SOUTH AFRICA BECAUSE HE WAS
FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN THEDIASPORA WITH WORKING CLASS
TAMILS FROM SOUTH INDIA. HEUNDERSTOOD THE ETHNIC,
RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL DIVERSITYOF HIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> HAD GANDHI SUCCEEDED AT THEBAR IN BOMBAY, YOU KNOW,
GANDHI AS A YOUNG MAN GOESTO LONDON, QUALIFIES AS A
BARRISTER AND COMES BACK WITHHIS SUIT TO BOMBAY AND FAILS
THE BAR NOT JUST ONCE BUTTWICE. AND HAD HE SUCCEEDED AS
A LAWYER IN BOMBAY YOUAND I WOULD NOT BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION. HE FAILEDAND RECEIVED PROFESSIONAL
OBLIVION BY AN INVITATIONIN SOUTH AFRICA WHERE HE
MADE HIS NAME AS AN ACTIVIST ANDWHERE HE MET AND BEFRIENDED AN
EXTRAORDINARY DIVERSITY OFPEOPLE WHO EXPANDED HIS
HORIZON. AND FINALLY, OFCOURSE, AGAINST RACIALLY
DISCRIMINATORY LAWIN SOUTH AFRICA HE LAUNCHED
THE WORLD'S FIRST NONVIOLENTPROTEST MOVEMENT, LATER
FOLLOWED SUCCESSFULLY BYDR. KING AND OTHERS BUT IF THIS
MAN HAD SUCCEEDED AS A LAWYER HEWOULD NOT HAVE TRANSFORMED INDIA
OR THE WORLD.
SO THERE IS A LESSON IN THIS.
>> Jon: THERE IS A LESSON.
AND LET THIS LESSON GO OUT TOJEWISH MOTHERS EVERYWHERE.
IF YOUR SON DOES NOT BECOME ALAWYER OR A DOCTOR, IT IS NOT
TRAGEDY, BUT, IN FACT, APRECURSOR TO GREATNESS!  THANK
YOU! HERE'S WHAT'S SOFASCINATING, TOO. SO,
[ APPLAUSE ]WHEN YOU SAY --
>> NOT JUST JEWISH MOTHERS, BUTINDIAN MOTHERS.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY,
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT IS A UNIVERSAL TRAITAMONGST THE MOTHER CLASS.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GANDHIBEFORE, IT IS HARD TO THINK OF
HIM EXISTING OUT OF INDIA ANDTHE IDEA THAT EVEN HIS FIRST
RISE TO CONSCIOUSNESS OFOPPRESSION WAS NOT EVEN WITHININDIA BUT
SOUTH AFRICA AND ALMOST NOT FORTHE APARTHEID STATE AND
SUBJUGATION OF THE BLACKPOPULATION BUT THE INDIAN
POPULATION THAT IS LIVING IN THEDIASPORA THERE.
>> YES. YOU KNOW, THE INDIANS,THEY WERE SEEN AS A SECT BY THE
EUROPEANS, BECAUSE OFCOURSE THE AFRICANS ARE MUCH
MORE NUMEROUS AND OFCOURSE THEY WOULD SOMETIMES RISE
IN INSURRECTIONS BUTTHEY WERE DISPERSED IN
THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THEY WERENOT EDUCATED.
THE INDIANS WERE RUNNING SHOPSON THE EUROPEN MAIN STREET,
DISPLACING DUTCH AND BRITISHSHOPKEEPERS. YOU HAD ERNEST
LAWYERS LIKE GANDHIWHO MIGHT TAKE OVER YOUR
BUSINESS, INDIANS ARE BECOMINGDOCTORS SO THERE WAS A KIND OF
PARANOIA ABOUT INDIANS AND WHOMIGHT MIGRATE IN THEIR LARGE
HOARDS FROM THEEAST AND CLAIM THE CONTINENT
YOU HAD COME IN, YOU KNOW,COLONIZING FROM THE WEST.
SO, THE FIRST RACIALLYDISCRIMINATORY LAWS SOME OF THEM
WERE APPLIED AGAINST INDIANS ANDTHE INDIAN RESISTANCE
LED BY GANDHI, YOU KNOW, OFCOURSE, THEN BECAME MUCH
GREATER AND MORE WIDESPREAD,THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
WAS FOUNDED IN 1912 TOWARDTHE END OF GANDHI'S STAY IN
SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS PARTLYINFLUENCED BY GANDHI'S EXAMPLE.
OF COURSE GANDHI WAS LIMITED ANDHE WASN'T A UNIVERSAL FIGURE AND
DIDN'T REACH OUT TO THEAFRICANS. HE HAD AFRICAN FRIENDS
BUT HE DID TAKE UP THEIR CAUSE,BUT BY SLOWLY AND PERSISTENTLY
UNDERMINING THE RACIAL EDIFICEOF THE SOUTH AFRICAN STATE IN A
MODEST WAY HE PREPARED THE WAYFOR NELSON MANDELA AND ALL
THE GREAT FIGURES WHO FOLLOWEDIN SOUTH AFRICA ITSELF AND OF
COURSE HE TRAINED HIMSELF TOUNDERTAKE THE KIND OF MASSIVE
FREEDOM STRUGGLE HE WAS TO DO ININDIA.
SO, SOUTH AFRICA WAS FORMATIVETO GANDHI.
AND IT WAS IGNORED INEARLIER BOOKS, SO I
>> Jon: AND FORMATIVE INOTHER WAYS ALSO BECAUSE HIS
INFLUENCES ARE COMING FROMTOLSTOY, FROM ALL
OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS THATYOU WOULD HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT.
IT IS FASCINATING.
>> YES.
AGAIN, IT IS CURIOUS, JON,GANDHI SO FAR AS I KNOW, NEVER
READ WAR AND PEACE OR ANNAKARENINA, HE HAD NO INTEREST IN
TOLSTOY THE NOVELIST BUT TOLSTOYTHE PHILOSOPHER. TOLSTOY WRITES
IN QUOTING A LINE FROM THEBIBLE, THE KINGDOM OF GOD
IS WITHIN YOU. THAT IS YOUR PATHTO TRUTH AND
SPIRITUALITY IS NOT WHAT THEBISHOP SAYS OR WHAT THE HOLY
IMMAN SAYS NOT WHAT THE HINDUHOLY MAN SAYS BUT YOU FIND IT
YOURSELF. SO IT'S IN THEDIASPORA THAT HE READS
TOLSTOY. IF HE WAS IN INDIA,HE PROBABLY WOULD NEVER HAVE
ENCOUNTERED IT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
IT IS A FASCINATING LOOK FROMANOTHER PERSPECTIVE AND I LOVE
IT, AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM ISMAKING ME VERY HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
I REALLY DO.
THIS IS AN EXCITING BOOK AND ANEXCITING PROJECT, GANDHI BEFORE
INDIA.
IT IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.GET IT.
RAMACHANDRA GUHA, THANK YOU,SIR.
