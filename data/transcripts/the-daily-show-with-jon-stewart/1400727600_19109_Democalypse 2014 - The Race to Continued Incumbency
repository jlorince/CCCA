>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOUTHIS EVENING. MY GUEST TONIGHT,
FORMER SECRETARY OF TREASURY TIMGEITHNER, WILL BE HERE,
AUTHOR OF THE NOVEL, WELL BOOK,"STRESS TEST."
I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHATIT'S ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER)OFF THE TOP, AN APOLOGY.
LAST NIGHT, I MAY HAVEINADVERTENTLY MADE SOME
DEROGATORY REMARKS TOWARDSPHILLIES MANAGER RYNE SANDBERG
AND THE ENTIRE CITY OFPHILADELPHIA. AND WHILE A CITY
THAT FAMOUSLY BOOED AND THREWSNOWBALLS AT SANTA CLAUSE
MAY DESERVE SOME SHADE, IHURT SOME PEOPLE THAT I CARE
ABOUT VERY MUCH, INCLUDING, ONE,PHILIP E. PHANATIC.
PHILLY THEY CALL HIM.
NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO NEED TOREHASH WHO CALLED WHO
"A (BLEEP) UP JIM HENSONREJECT LOOKING PIECE OF
(BLEEP)."
THE POINT IS, IT WAS SAID.
MOST LIKELY BY THE ONE OF US WHODOESN'T HAVE A BLOW TICKLER IN
PLACE OF A FUNCTIONING LARYNX.
HOWEVER, AFTER OUR TAPING, IREALIZED THAT "MY" PREFERRED
BASEBALL CLUB, THE NEW YORKMETROPOLITANS HAS A MASCOT
ALSO INHABITS THE NETHERWORLDTWIXT HUMAN AND ANIMAL.
HE HAS A GIANT BASEBALL INSTEADOF A HEAD.
WHY AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THATCONDITION WOULD TAKE A
JOB IN A PLACE WHERE HE ISSURROUNDED ALL DAY
BY BATS, SEEMS LIKE A RECIPE FORTROUBLE.
THE POINT IS, I'M APOLOGIZE IF IOFFENDED MR. PHANATIC.
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT YOUR LIFEHAS BEEN SINCE THAT SEX TAPE
CAME OUT.
SERIOUSLY, WAS THAT THE CARDINALMASCOT IN THE CORNER
PLEASURING HIMSELF. I DON'TKNOW HOW THAT GUY GOT IN THERE.
WITH THAT OUT OF THE WAY, WETURN TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS
AND OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF"DEMOCALYPSE 2014:
THE RACE TO CONTINUEDINCUMBENCY."
YESTERDAY SAW PRIMARY VOTES INSIX STATES.
BUT NOT YOUR USUAL, BORINGPRIMARIES.

>> MCCONNELL WAS THE NUMBER ONEREPUBLICAN TARGET FOR TEA PARTY
GROUPS AROUND THECOUNTRY. AND HE EASILY
