I'M JON STEWART.
NICE.
TONIGHT WE GOT OUR SELVES AHUMDINGER ON THE PROGRAM.
A SENATOR FROM THEGREAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS,
ELIZABETH WARREN, IS GOINGTO BE JOINING US.
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT RIGHTAWAY WITH BREAKING NEWS FROM
THE INSIDE OF ANOTHERHUMAN BEING.
>> MARK AND I VERY EXCITED THATWE HAVE OUR FIRST CHILD ARRIVING
LATER THIS YEAR.
>> OH MY GOD, THEY'VEGOT A CHILD ARRIVING,
HOW DID THEY PULL THAT OFF?REALLY, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS?
I MEAN, IF THAT'S HOW ITHAPPENS,
I SHOULD HAVE SIX KIDS! OHREALLY, NOT EVERY TIME?
OH, OKAY.
[ Laughter ]>> HERE'S THE ODD THING
ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT:DARRELL ISSA HAS ALREADY
SUBPOENAED THE BABY TO TESTIFYABOUT BENGHAZI.
TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW, BABY.
[ Laughter ]>> BUT CONGRATULATIONS TO THE
CLINTON FAMILY.
NEWS MEDIA?
SET THE 2016 PRESIDENTIALSPECULATRON TO BABY.
>> EVERYBODY IS WONDERING WHATIMPACT IT MIGHT HAVE ON HILARY
CLINTON'S DECISION TO RUN FORPRESIDENT IN 2016
DOES THE FACT THAT SHE'S GOINGTO BECOME A GRANDMOTHER ON TOP
OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FACTORIN?
>> COULD IT PUT A BUMP INHILLARY'S 2016 PLANS?
AND IS IT SEXIST TO ASK?
>> NO SILLY BILLY, OF COURSEIT'S NOT SEXIST.
EVEN THOUGH IT IS A QUESTIONTHAT HAS NEVER EVER BEEN POSED
TO A MALE CANDIDATE EVER.
FOR GOD SAKES, MITT ROMNEY HASLIKE A LITTER OF GRANDCHILDREN.
MITT ROMNEY HAS FOR GOD SAKES,IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, MITT ROMNEY
HAS LIKE A GRANDCHILD PETTINGZOO!
[ Laughter ]>> THE GUY ADDED THREE
GRANDCHILDREN WHILE HE WASCAMPAIGNING!
HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE INHISTORY WHOSE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
TOTAL IS LESS THAN THENUMBER OF CHAIRS HE HAS TO
PUT OUT AT THANKSGIVING. MYPOINT IS HE GOT CRUSHED IN THE
ELECTION BY SOMEONE WITH NOGRANDCHILDREN. YET SOMEHOW
THE GRANDCHILDREN FACTOR NEVERCAME UP IN THE RACE BETWEEN
OBAMA AND ROMNEY. FOR GOD'SSAKE, WHEN WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT
WAS RUNNING IN 1908,HE WAS ACTUALLY PREGNANT.
HE WAS PREGNANT. NO ONE SAIDANYTHING.
IT'S AS THOUGH MEN AND WOMEN ARETREATED DIFFERENTLY.
LIKE THEY'RE FROM TWO DIFFERENTPLANETS. LET'S CALL ONE OF THOSE
PLANETS MARS, AND THEOTHER PLANET, LET'S CALL IT UH,
BLIGORP 7. FOR INSTANCE,SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN,
22 YEAR SENATE VETERAN FROM THEGREAT STATE OF BLIGORP 7.
FEINSTEIN CHAIRS THESENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
WHICH RECENTLY COMPLETED A NEWREPORT ABOUT THE CIA'S BUSH
ERA'S TORTURE PROGRAM. THECOMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO RELEASE
THEIR FINDINGS THAT THE CIA'SPROGRAMS WERE FAR MORE
BRUTAL AND WIDESPREAD THAN HADBEEN REPORTED THAT THE CIA HAD
BRUTAL AND WIDESPREAD THAN HADBEEN REPORTED THAT THE CIA HAD
OVERSTATED TORTURE'SEFFECTIVENESS.
OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
>> FORMER CIA DIRECTOR MICHAELHAYDEN CHARACTERIZED
SENATOR DIANE FEINSTEIN'SMOTIVATION FOR RELEASING
THE REPORT AS EMOTIONAL.
>>THAT MOTIVATION FOR THEREPORT, CHRIS, MAY SHOW DEEP
EMOTIONAL FEELING ON THE PARTOF THE SENATOR BUT I DON'T THINK
IT LEADS YOU TO AN OBJECTIVEREPORT.
>> Jon: SENATOR JUST NEEDS HERBEAUTY SLEEP.
THAT'S ALL SHE NEEDS.
[ Laughter ]>> SO THE WAY THE FORMER HEAD OF
THE CIA IS DEFENDING THATAGENCY'S USE OF TORTURE IS TO
ARGUE THAT THE INFORMATION INTHE SENATOR'S REPORT IT
UNRELIABLE BECAUSE IT WASIMPARTED UNDER EMOTIONAL
DISTRESS.
WELL -- I TELL YOU, THAT GUY ISGOING TO BE SAD TOMORROW TO SEE
THAT ZINGER IN HIS INBOX.
YOU KNOW, IT IS A THEME WE SEEAGAIN AND AGAIN.
YOU KNOW?
WHEN ALLIES OF CHRIS CHRISTIERELEASED A REPORT EXONERATING
CHRISTIE IN THE BRIDGEGATESCANDAL,
HIS FORMER AIDE BRIDGET ANNEKELLY PROVOKED SIMILAR CONCERNS.
>> SHE SEEMED EMOTIONAL. SHE WASHABITUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW
SHE WAS PERCEIVED BY THEGOVERNOR. A BOYFRIEND HAD ENDED
A RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S INREFERENCE TO ONE OF THE
CHRISTIE OFFICIALS SHE WASWITH, THE REPORT COMMISSIONED BY
MR. CHRISTIE AND RELEASEDTHURSDAY DOUBLES DOWN ON A
STRATEGY OF PORTRAYING MS.KELLY AS DUPLICITOUS, WEEPING
FREQUENTLY AND DEPENDENT ON MENFOR APPROVAL AND STABILITY.
>> NO?
BUT THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDEDTHAT KELLY, QUOTE, WOULD LOOK
MUCH PRETTIER IF SHE SMILED. ANDCONCLUDED THAT THE COMMISSION
HATED TO SEE HER RESIGN BUTLOVED TO WATCH HER GO.
