UNRELATED ACTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT YOU KNOW?
THEY DON'T HAVE A DIRECTOR.
THEY HAVE ATF AGENTS.
IN 1972, I WENT ON IN THE 70s THERE WAS 2500 AGENTS AND THERE WAS STILL 2500 AGENTS.
39 YEARS LATER --
>> Jon: NOT THE SAME ONES, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
POLICING OVER 100,000 GUN DEALERS IN THIS COUNTRY WITH A COUPLE THOUSAND AGENTS WHO ARE
ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL MAY SEEM IMPOSSIBLE BUT HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS.
18 YEARS AGO A PROFESSOR ANALYZED ATF TRACING DATA AND FOUND 57% OF GUNS USED IN
CRIMES, THE ILLEGAL GUNS COULD BE TRACED BACK TO 1% OF THE LICENSED GUN DEALERS.
ALL THE ATF HAS TO DO IS CREATE A REGISTRY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.
TRACE THEM BACK TO THE BAD DEALERS AND THOSE DEALERS RUINING IT FOR THE LAW ABIDING
GUN DEALER AND CITIZENS, FLOODING CITIES WITH ILLEGAL GUNS -- MAKE IT STOP.
>> ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THE BUREAU IS PROHIBITING FROM CREATING A FEDERAL REGISTRY
OF OF GUN TRANSACTIONS.
>> Jon: WHAT THE (bleep) ARE YOU DOING?
WHY?
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WAS IT GETTING TOO EASY TO POLICE ILLEGAL GUNS?
WHAT IF WE DO IT WITH OUR ARMS LIKE THIS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
ARE THERE ANY SOMEWHAT COME CALL LIMITS ON -- COMICAL LIMITS ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S
ABILITY TO ENDORSE FEDERAL LAW.
NORMALLY I GET THAT THROUGH THE EAR BUT THE KNEW -- PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM DIDN'T REALIZE THE
QUESTION WAS RETOURICCAL.
I'LL -- RHETORICAL.
I'LL BITE.
THE ATF ISN'T ALLOWED TO INSPECT DEALERS MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR AND IN REALITY GET TO INSPECT
THEM ONCE EVERY 17 YEARS.
I'M ASSUMING THAT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH AGENTS AND NOT THAT THE ATF AGENTS ARE CICADAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET THAT INSECT JOKE JUST WASH OVER YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I GUESS SELF REPORT INVENTORIES FROM DEALERS ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING.
WHAT IS THAT?
OH, MY GOD!
WHY IT'S GUNTHER MY MESSENGER PIGEON.
WE CAN'T RELY ON SELF REPORTED INVENTORIES EITHER BECAUSE THE ATF CANNOT REQUIRE DEALERS TO
KEEP TRACK OF THEIR OWN INVEN TOURISM A CONGRESSMAN STUCK AN AMENDMENT INTO A FEDERAL
SPENDING BILL THAT RESTRICTED THE ATF'S ABILITY TO DO WHAT THE NRA SAID THEY SHOULD DO.
IT REQUIRED THE DESTRUCTION OF BACKGROUND CHECK RECORDS WITHIN 24 HOURS.
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE SURE NO MISTAKES COULD BE CORRECTED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO DID THIS?
WHAT CONGRESSMAN JAMMED THIS AMENDMENT INTO AN UNRELATED SPENDING BILL COMPLETELY
CASTRATING THE ATF'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE GUN LAWS.
>> THE AMENDMENT WITH YOUR NAME TIAHRT.
>> IT WAS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO PROTECT US.
>> Jon: HOLY (bleep) YOU ARE THE GUY FROM FIVE MINUTES AGO SAYING SLOW DOWN MUNICIPALITIES
THE ATF HAS THE ENFORCEMENT GAME, LET THE ATF HANDLE IT AND THEN --
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU HAVE BROKEN MY TEA HEART.
WEE.
THE AMENDMENT COULDN'T BE WORSE IF THE NRA WROTE IT THEMSELVES.
OH, BOY.
NO!
GUNTHER, WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU BE IN THE TUBE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO CROSS ANTIQUATED MESSAGE DELIVERY SYSTEMS LIKE THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE NRA DID WRITE THAT LAW.
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE ATF HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DEBALLED.
THANKS TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT THEY HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL THAT THEY USE TO ENCOURAGE GUN OWNERS
TO ACT RESPONSIBLY.
>> THOUGH IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW ATF SUGGESTS YOU CONDUCT A COMPLETE FIREARMS
INVENTORY ONCE A YEAR.
>> IF YOU HAVE A BUYER THAT APPEARS TO BE UNDER THE INCLUDE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL AND IT
APPEARS THEIR JUDGMENT MAY BE IMPAIRED, YOU MAY WANT TO DENY THE SALE.
NOT BECAUSE IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE GUN CONTROL ACT BUT BECAUSE THAT PERSON'S JUDGMENT IS LIKELY IMPAIRED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S UP TO YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT OUR JOB AT THE ATF TO TELL YOU YOU CAN'T SELL GUNS TO DRUNK PEOPLE.
I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH TO THE GUN DEALERS YOU CAN SELL THE GUN TO THE DRUNK PEOPLE BUT IF THOSE
