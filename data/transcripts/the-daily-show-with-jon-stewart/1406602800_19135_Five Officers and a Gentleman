WELCOME.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
TONIGHT'S GUEST, SONIA NAZARIO,AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, "ENRIQUE'S
JOURNEY," IT'S ABOUT A YOUNGHONDURAN BOY'S ATTEMPT TO COME
TO AMERICA AND FINDHIS MOTHER, AND NOT AS THE TITLE
MIGHT LEAD DO YOU BELIEVE,AN INSPIRING TALE OF
ENRIQUE IGLESIAS'SBATTLE TO ACCEPT THE
MOLE THAT WAS ON HIS FACE ANDOBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
AWAY THE ENDING, BUT HE HAS ITREMOVED.
[LAUGHTER]BUT FIRST, OVER THE PAST FEW
YEARS, NEW YORK CITY HAS DONE ANAWFUL LOT TO CLEAN UP TIMES
SQUARE.
YOU BEEN DOWN TO TIMES SQUARE?
IT IS NOT THE ROMANTIC JUNKIEHAUNTED, CRACK INFESTED,
BEHOOKERED PLAYGROUND WE ALLLOVE.
GONE ARE THE DAYS YOU GOT TOWORRY ABOUT SOME MASKED STRANGER
DEMANDING THAT YOU HAND OVER ALLYOUR MONEY.
WELL, ALMOST.
>> 25-YEAR-OLD JUNIOR BISHOPDRESSED AS SPIDER-MAN TOOK A
PHOTO WITH TWO PEOPLE.
AND WHEN THE COUPLE ATTEMPTED TOGIVE THE MAN $1, BISHOP SAID HE
ONLY TAKES $5, $10 AND $20s.
A POLICE OFFICER OVERHEARD THECONVERSATION AND STEPPED IN,
TELLING THE COUPLE THEY CANDONATE WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THE OFFICER ASKED FOR BISHOP'SI.D.
BUT HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE ANI.D.
>> Jon: [WHISPERING]: HIS REALNAME'S PETER PARKER,
P-A-R-K-ER.
HE LIVES WITH HIS AUNT INQUEENS.
[LAUGHTER]AND IT'S HIS FAULT UNCLE BEN
DIED.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]IT WAS HIS FAULT!
SPIDER-MAN'S EGOTISM CAUSEDTHAT.
HE WASN'T SPIDER-MAN AT THETIME.
HE WAS PETER PARKER AND HEDIDN'T REALIZE WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY,BUT AT THE TIME HE DIDN'T HAVE
GREAT POWER BUT HE [BLEEP] UNCLEBEN.
NOBODY CAN TELL ME ANYDIFFERENT.
[LAUGHTER]ANYWAY, SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS
LITTLE THING HERE IS NOT GOINGTO END WELL.
>> THE OFFICER TOLD BISHOP HEWAS GOING TO PLACE HIM UNDER
ARREST. AND THAT'SWHEN POLICE SAY BISHOP
PUNCHED THE OFFICER IN THEFACE.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]>> Jon: WITH GREAT POWER COMES
LACK OF IMPULSE CONTROL.
[LAUGHTER]I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION
EVERYBODY HAS IN THIS SITUATIONIS: DID BATMAN THINK THAT THE
POLICE WERE JUSTIFIED?
>> LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THESTATEN ISLAND.
SOMEBODY GET CHOKED JUST LIKETHAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HE COULDGET CHOKED FOR THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: BRUCE!
BRUCE!
WE CAN SEE YOUR FACE, BRUCE.
[LAUGHTER]OF COURSE, THE INCIDENT BATMAN
IS REFERENCING WAS AN INCIDENTWHERE POLICE GOT OUT OF CONTROL
IN STATEN ISLAND.
IT WAS A TRAGIC CASE OF ERICGARNER.
>> ERIC GARNER IS THE STATENISLAND MAN WHO DIED IN POLICE
CUSTODY AFTER AN ALLEGEDCHOKEHOLD.
>> MR. GARNER WAS ALLEGEDLYSELLING WHAT'S CALLED IN NEW
YORK CITY LOOSIES, CIGARETTES,UNTAXED CIGARETTES AT
75 CENTS APIECE.
>> Jon: SURE, THAT'S HOW ITSTARTS.
BUT THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,THAT GUY'S SELLING GUM ONE STICK
AT A TIME AND PRINGLES BY THECHIP.
[LAUGHTER]PRINGLES SINGLES OR SPRINGLES,
AS THEY'RE KNOWN ON THE STREET.
WELL, WE CAN AT LEAST HOPE ERICGARNER'S SENSELESS DEATH MARKS
THE END OF EXCESSIVE FORCE BYPOLICE.
>> THE NEW YORK CITY POLICEDEPARTMENT SAYS UP TO 1,000
REPORTS OF SUSPECTS BEING PLACEDIN ILLEGAL CHOKEHOLDS MAY NOW
HAVE TO BE REVIEWED.
>> NYPD OFFICIALS SAY THE ENTIREFORCE MAY HAVE TO BE RETRAINED.
>> Jon: OKAY, RETRAININGLESSON NUMBER ONE: THIS IS A
CAMERA PHONE.
WHEN THAT IS POINTED AT YOU,OFFICER, STOP STRANGLING THE
PERSON.
