[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: HEY!  WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JONSTEWART.
MAN DO WE HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS GOING TO BETALKING ABOUT A BOOK I HAVE NOT
BEEN THIS EXCITED ABOUT A BOOKIN GOD KNOWS HOW LONG, I MEAN
YOU KNOW HALF THE CRAP I HAVE TOREAD ON
THIS SHOW, BUT THIS BOOK, THEAUTHOR IS NOT DAVID MITCHELL,
DAVID MITCHELL IS GOING TO BE ONHERE PROMOTING IT.
IT IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY AJAPANESE 13-YEAR-OLD BOY ABOUT
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE AUTISM.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLETHINGS I THINK I HAVE EVER READ.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LASTNIGHT'S MARCH TOWARD GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN, THE CABLE NEWSNETWORKS
WERE SO EXCITED THEY WHIPPED OUTTHEIR CLOCKS, TRANSITIONING
RELENTLESSLY FROM COUNT DOWNCLOCK TO BEFORE SHUTDOWN TO
COUNT DOWN CLOCK AFTER SHUTDOWNBECAUSE ON CABLE NEWS THIS IS
THE DEMARCATION POINT IN HISTORYON PAR WITH THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.
>> BY THE WAY, CNN HAS JUST BEENGIVEN A NEW SHOW, TIME OF DAY.
>> COMING UP ON OUR 6 O'CLOCKHOUR, 6 O'CLOCK.
>> KIDDING, CNN WOULD NEVER GIVEA SHOW TO A CLOCK, THEY WOULD
GIVE IT TO TWO PUNDITS WITHOPPOSING VIEWS
ABOUT WHAT TIME IT IS.
CLOCKFIRE!
TONIGHT AT 8:00, NO, IT IS ATTHREE!
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.
THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF A FEWBRAVE HOUSE REPUBLICAN
MORONS WE ALL GET TO NOW
CELEBRATE THE MARCH OF DUMBS. >>>> GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN! LET'S
HEAR IT!
>> FROM AN ACTUAL CONGRESSMAN ASTO WHY WE HAD TO SHUT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOWN.
>> WE JUST WANT TO HELP THEAMERICAN PEOPLE GET BY AND
THROUGH IS ONE OF THE MOSTINSIDIOUS LAWS EVER CREATED
BY MAN, AND THAT IS OBAMACARE.
>> Jon: BRAVO.
NOT JUST ONE OF THE MOSTINSIDIOUS LAWS BY AMERICA, WHICH
HAS JIM CROW AND SLAVERY ON ITSRESUME OF LAWS, BUT BY MAN,
PUTTINGOBAMACARE UP WITH THE NUREMBERG
LAWS, THE SPANISH INQUISITIONAND THE MEDIEVAL LAW WHERE
ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT, THE KINGGETS TO
SLEEP WITH YOUR WIFE.
>> HEY HE MAY BE BANGING MYBRIDE BUT AT LEAST HE IS NOT
FORCING ME INTO A HEALTHCAREEXCHANGE.
I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENTSTANDING BETWEEN ME AND THE GUY
THAT APPLIES MY LEECHES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE PEASANT HASAN ACCENT LIKE THAT BUT IT
SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE FROMJERSEY.
ANYWAY, THE HOUSE REPUBLICANSHAVE MADE THE INCREDIBLY
UNPOPULAR MOVE OF FORCING ASHUTDOWN OF THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT, TO SAVE US ALL FROMHAVING THE KING BANG OUR WIVES.
THERE'S ONLY ONETHING LEFT TO DO. FOX!
TO THE DAMAGE CONTROL STATION! MAN THE STRAW MAN.
I WONDER IF IT IS GOING TO BELIKE THE SEQUESTER WHERE BEFORE
THE SEQUESTER WE HEARDESSENTIALLY THE SKY IS GOING TO
FALL AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEELTHE PAIN IMMEDIATELY.
NOT SO MUCH.
THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED ISSOME MUSEUMS CLOSED AND SOMEONE
CAN'T GO TO THE STATUE OFLIBERTY.
>> WE WERE WARNED THE SKY WASGOING TO FALL BUT THE SUN CAME
UP, DIDN'T IT?
>> NO ONE TOLD YOU THE SKY WASGOING TO FALL.
NO ONE TOLD YOU THE GOVERNMENTSHUTDOWN HAD THE SAME EFFECT AS
AN ASTEROID HITTING THE PLANET.
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DIDAFFECT THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD
TELL US THAT IS HAPPENING. BUTTHE POINT IS, ON FOX,
NO BIGGY.
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME OUTYESTERDAY AND WENT THROUGH A
LIST OF WHAT WASN'T GOING TOCHANGE HE SAID WE WILL HAVE AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, MEDICARE,GO TO THE DOCTOR, I WAS SITTING
THERE, WAIT A MINUTE, HE ISMAKING THE CASE FOR THE
REPUBLICANS, IT IS PRETTY GOOD.
>> MAYBE I AM ONE OF THE FEWPEOPLE THAT THIS DOESN'T IMPACT
ME MENTALLY.
WE HAVE HAD 17 GOVERNMENTSHUTDOWNS, GOVERNOR, I AM NOT
AFRAID OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS OFGOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.
>> Jon: HOW BAD CAN IT BE IF ITDOESN'T PERSONALLY AFFECT SEAN
HANNITY?
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SHUT DOWNSMITH AND WOLLENSKY FOR
PRIVATE EVENTS. OR CLOSED OURNATION'S STRATEGIC FLAG
GRAPHIC RESERVES. OR IF ROGERAILES
IMPLEMENTED A NO GRUNTING POLICYIN THE MEN'S ROOM.
