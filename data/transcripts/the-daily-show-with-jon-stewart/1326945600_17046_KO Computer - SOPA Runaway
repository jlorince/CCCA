IT MAKES NO SENSE.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> I CAN'T TALK, JON, I'M
SCOUTING THE NEXT FREIGHT TRAIN
TO ANYWHERE-TOWN, JUST TRYING
THE KEEP ONE STEP AHEAD OF
JOHNNY LAW.
>> Jon: JESSICA, WHY ARE YOU
IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW?
>> SOPA, JON.
I'M AN INFRINGER, A SONG
SMUGLIER, A COPY-RAT, A
RED-HANDED VIDEO LIFTER.

MAN, THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
I MEAN, I LOOK GOOD, BUT THAT
WAS A MISTAKE.
>> Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THEY WOULD ARREST YOU FOR
SINGING BEYONCE IN YOUR PAJAMAS?
>> OH, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
DIDN'T YOU SEE THE TV IN THIS T
BACKGROUND.
IT WAS TUNED INTO AN EPISODE OF
"NEWHART."
DAMMIT, YOU HAVE [BLEEPED] ME
FOR THE LAST TIME, BOB NEWHART.
>> Jon: IS THAT REALLY A
COPYRIGHT VIOLATION?
>> OF COURSE, WHY WOULD ANYONE
BUY A "NEWHART" D.V.D. WHEN THEY
CAN SEE MY VIDEO OF "NEWHART"
BLURRY WITH NO VOLUME FOR FREE.
>> Jon: JESSICA, DON'T GO.
THIS IS ONLY YOUR SECOND
ASSIGNMENT.
WE HAVE LAWYERS HERE WHO CAN
HELP YOU.
>> I SURE DO APPRECIATE THAT,
JON, BUT THERE'S NO ROOM IN THIS
ROTTEN WORLD FOR A BUM PALOOKA
LIKE ME.
BESIDES, JON, YOU HAVE WYATT AND
AASIF AND THE TWINS TO TAKE CARE
OF.
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GROWING UP SO
FAST.
HEY, GIVE 'EM A HUG FOR ME,
WOULD YA?
AND ON CLEAR NIGHT, TELL THEM TO
STAIR UP AT THE BIG YELLOW MOON,
BECAUSE I'LL BE LOOKING UP AT
IT, TOO.
HEY, JON, I LEFT SOMETHING IN
YOUR POCKET FOR DO YOU REMEMBER
ME BY.
>> Jon: HALF A LOCKET.
>> UH-HUH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I'LL WEAR IT FOREVER.
YOU'LL WEAR THE OTHER HALF.
>> WHAT OTHER HALF?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon:, THE HALF YOU WEAR SO
WHEN WE FIND EACH OTHER AGAIN
AND PUT THE TWO PIECES BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN...
>> OH, NO, JON, THERE'S NO OTHER
HALF.
>> Jon: WE EACH GET ONE, IT
SYMBOLIZES NO MATTER HOW FAR
APART WE ARE...
>> OH, NO, I ONLY BROUGHT ONE
HALF.
SEE YA.
>> Jon: BYE.
