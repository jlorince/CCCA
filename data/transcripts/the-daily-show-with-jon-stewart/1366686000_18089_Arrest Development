>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WHAT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
FROM THE HIT SHOW MAD MAN
CHRISTINA HENDRICKS WILL BE
JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT.
BUT, FOLKS, A LOT HAS HAPPENED
SINCE WE LAST SPOKE ON THURSDAY.
FOR A COUNTRY WHOSE POLITICAL
INSTITUTIONS HAVE IN MANY WAYS
STUNNED MERCURY SENTLY WITH THE
LACK OF COURAGE AND COMPETENCE,
IT WAS REFRESHING TO SEE SOME OF
OUR CIVIC INSTITUTIONS
DISPLAYING BOTH TRAITS IN FULL
FORCE: CARING FOR THE WOUNDED,
TRACKING DOWN, KILLING AND/OR
CAPTURING PERPS, WE CALL THEM
PERPS IN THE MAKE-BELIEVE LAW
ENFORCEMENT TRADE.
DOING IT ALL WITHIN ONE WEEK OR
TO PUT THAT IN POLITICAL SENATE
TERMS, THREE FILIBUSTERS AND A
SECRET POLL.
AS ALWAYS AFTER THE CRISIS
PASSES, THOUGHTS TURN TO WHAT
DOES THIS MEAN?
FIRST, REFLECTIONS FROM
OVERSEAS.
>> THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS A
EUROPEAN COUNTRY.
IT'S A DIFFERENT THING THAN
CHECHNYA.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE CZECH
REPUBLIC AMBASSADOR FEELING THE
JUSTIFIED NEED TO EXPLAIN TO AN
AMERICAN AUDIENCE THAT TWO
SIMILAR-SOUNDING FOREIGN NATIONS
ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME
NATION.
I INTERRUPTED YOU.
PLEASE GO ON.
>> OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN SEEING
THINGS ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA THAT
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE CZECH
REPUBLIC AND CHECHNYA.
THE SCHEM REPUBLIC IS A COUNTRY
OF CENTRAL EUROPE AND YOUR NATO
ALLY.
>> Jon: WHO SAID THE CZECH
REPUBLIC WASN'T AN ALLY.
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE WOULD
OVERREACT TO A TERROR ATTACK ON
OUR SOIL BY INVADING A COUNTRY
THAT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO
DO WITH... (LAUGHING).
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
ALL RIGHT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU CALLING US STUPID?
THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO GET A
COUNTRY BOMBED.
NO, NO DISRESPECT.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS HERE IN
AMERICA, THIS TRAGEDY ABSOLUTELY
DEMONSTRATES THE INTENSE URGENCY
OF WHATEVER ISSUE WAS ALREADY
YOUR PRECONCEIVED PRIORITY.
>> WE'RE ADDRESSING A BROKEN
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
WHAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON AND
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM I THINK
SHOULD URGE US TO ACT QUICKER
NOT SLOWER WHEN IT COMES TO
GETTING THE 11 MILLION IDENTIFY.
>> Jon: IMMIGRATION REFORM MUST
PROCEED POSTHASTE.
>> GIVEN THE EVENTS OF THIS WEEK
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO
UNDERSTAND THE GAPS AND
LOOPHOLES IN OUR IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE...
>> Jon: WE NEED TO SLOW
IMMIGRATION DOWN.
IN THE WAKE OF THE BOSTON TERROR
ATTACK THE ONLY THING MORE
IMPORTANT THAN GETTING
IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE IS
SLOWING IMMIGRATION REFORM DOWN.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THIS IS A BIT OF A RORSCHACH
CRIME IN THE SAME WAY YOU MIGHT
LOOK AT THIS RORSCHACH BLOT AND
SEE A BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY
SITTING ON A PENIS.
WHEREAS OTHERS MIGHT LOOK AT
THAT RORSCHACH AND SEE AN
ANNOYING BUTTERFLY BLOCKING MY
VIEW OF THAT PENIS.
SHOO, SHOO.
>> OUR NEXT GUEST IS FACING
MOUNTING CRITICISM FOR A TWEET
SENT MOMENTS AFTER THE CAPTURE
OF THE SECOND BOMBING SUSPECT.
NEW YORK STATE SENATOR GREG BALL
WROTE THIS.
SO [BLEEP] NUMBER 2 IN CUSTODY.
WHO WOULDN'T USE TORTURE ON THIS
PUNK TO SAVE MORE LIVES?
>> Jon: I GET IT.
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE EMOTIONAL ON
TWITTER.
YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING.
YOU GET CHARGED UP.
YOU MIGHT END UP IMPULSIVELY
ADVOCATING TORTURE OR GETTING IN
A FLAME WAR WITH A BELIEVER.
I'M SORRY.
I THINK ANNE FRANK IS MORE OF A
ONE-DIRECTION TYPE GAL.
ANY OTHER VERSIONS OF THE
BOMBING'S REAL LESSON.
>> IN WATERTOWN THEY'RE GOING
DOOR TO DOOR.
THERE WAS A REAL CONCERN THAT
THIS FELL OAL MIGHT BE ON THE
LOOSE.
MIGHT BREAK INTO THEIR HOUSE AND
MIGHT TAKE HOSTAGES.
WOULD PEOPLE HAVE LIKED TO HAVE
GUNS SNIEM SURE.
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE EVERYTHING
GO MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY IF ONLY
EVERYONE HAD GUNS AND BOMBS AND
WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THEY COULD
GET THEIR HANDS ON.
LET ME PLAY YOU THE ACTUAL
FOOTAGE OF THIS GUY'S ARREST.
YOU NEEDED A HELMET.
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED.
