(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT!
ON OUR PROGRAM, NEW YORK MAYORWILLIAM DEBLASIO WILL JOIN US
LATER.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,THE MIDDLE EAST, A BIT OF A
MESS THESE DAYS
(LAUGHTER)I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB
AND SAY A LITTLE BIT OF A MESS,NAMELY BECAUSE OF ARTIFACT
SMASHING GUILLITINEFETISHISTS OR AS WE CALL
CALL THEM, ISIS. YOU PROBABLYKNEW THAT.
WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS THERE'SONLY ONE REASON WHY I.S.I.S. IS
EVEN IN EXISTENCE.
>> PULLING ALL U.S. TROOPS OUTOF IRAQ DIRECTLY LED TO GROUPS
LIKE I.S.I.S. QUICKLY ACHIEVINGPOWER IN OUR COUNTRY.
>> THE REASON THEY DIDN'T LEAVERESIDUAL FORCE IN IRAQ IS THE
REASON WE'RE FACING I.S.I.S.
TODAY.
>> I.S.I.S. IS THE CREATIONAFTER WE PULLED OUT THE TROOPS
IN 2011.
THAT WAS THE KEY MISTAKE MADE BYTHIS ADMINISTRATION.
>> Jon: OF COURSE!
OBAMA!
OBAMA'S DECISION TO PULL TROOPSOUT OF IRAQ WAS ONLY FOLLOWING
THE DICTATES OF THE 2008AGREEMENT PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED
WITH IRAQ OR AS HISTORIANS NOWREFER TO THAT AGREEMENT THE
STATUS OF "DUCK!"
ANOTHER MISTAKE.
YOU DON'T GO TO THE PRESSCONFERENCE WITHOUT WEARING SHOE
HELMET ONE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD
REALLY WORK.
POINT TAKEN, IF ONLY WE HADSPENT JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN
THE $25 BILLION IN TEN YEARS OFEQUIPPING AND TRAINING THE IRAQI
ARMY WE ALREADY SPENT, THEENTIRE COUNTRY WOULD BE THE
FRAGRANT DEMOCROBLOSSOM WEPLANTED THERE AND WE COULD GO
BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL PLAN FORREGION, WAIT UNTIL IT RUNS
OUT OF OIL AND STOP GIVING A(BLEEP) ABOUT IT.
(LAUGHTER)OH...
ONE OTHER THING.
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE I.S.I.S.
WE'RE FIGHTING NOW IS RUN BYSOME VERY FAMILIAR FOLK.
>> A LOT OF THESE I.S.I.S.
FORCES ARE FORMER BAATHISTS,IRAQI MILITARY OFFICERS WHO
WORKED FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN.
>> Jon: TWO UPSETTING THINGSHERE.
ONE, I CANNOT BELIEVE IRAQ'SVETERAN REEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM IS
MORE EFFICIENT THAN OURS.
DAMN IT!
AND, TWO, IT MAKES IT SEEM --(LAUGHTER)
-- IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE MAYBEOUR DECISION IN 2003 TO DISBAND
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S ARMY, TAKINGAWAY THEIR JOBS, DIGNITY, FUTURE
PROSPECTS, BASICALLY EVERYTHINGBUT THEIR WEAPONS WAS DUMB.
AND BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU'REWONDERING WHAT KIND OF DUMMY
-FIED DUMMY WOULD DUMBLY MAKESUCH A DUMB DECISION, IT WAS
BREMMER!
THE POINT IS OBAMA'S DECISION TOPULL TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ MAY HAVE
HELPED TO CREATE I.S.I.S. AS DIDTHE DECISION TO DISBAND SADDAM'S
ARMY, AS DID THE DECISION TOINVADE A COUNTRY THAT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH 9/11,OVERTHROWING ITS ESTABLISHED
GOVERNMENT, THINKING THE POWERVACUUM WOULD BE FILLED BY AN
UNPRECEDENTED PEACEFUL,DEMOCRATIC SUNNI-SHIA
POWER SHARING AGREEMENT ALIGNEDWITH
THE UNITED STATES AND THEIRNEW WESTERN STYLE DEMOCRACY
WOULD BE A SHINING EXAMPLE TOTHE MIDDLE EAST BUT OF COURSE,
NOW, I'M (BLEEP) NIT-PICKING!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)IT IS ALMOST AS IF THIS
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX PROBLEM CANBE TRACED BACK TO MORE THAN ONE
BAD DECISION!
(LAUGHTER)WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW
SEGMENT, AMERICAN MIDDLE EAST,LEARNING CURVES ARE FOR PUSSIES
(APPLAUSE)OF COURSE, NOT LEAVING OUR
TROOPS IN IRAQ WOULD NOT HAVEBEEN AS BIG A PROBLEM HAD WE
NOT -- NOT LEFT OUR TROOPS --HERE'S THE DEAL...
(LAUGHTER)TO STOP I.S.I.S., WE KNOW OBAMA
SHOULD NOT HAVE WITHDRAWN OURTROOPS, BUT WHAT SHOULD OBAMA
HAVE DONE?
>> I.S.I.S. EMERGED FROM THECHAOS OF SYRIA BECAUSE WE WERE
NOT WILLING TO ARM AND TRAINMODERATE REBELS.
>> WE SHOULD IDENTIFY PEOPLE WECOULD WORK WITH ON THE GROUND IN
SYRIA AND EMPOWER THEM.
>> I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ARMEDTHE SYRIAN REBELS EARLY IN THE
CONFLICT.
>> Jon: AND YOU'RE SAYING WHYIN GOD'S NAME SHOULD WE TAKE
ADVICE FROM PEOPLE WHO WEREWRONG ABOUT THIS CLUSTER (BLEEP)
IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR IDEASABOUT UN (BLEEP) THIS CLUSTER?
THE REASON IS WHEN IT COMES TOAMERICA IN THE MIDDLE EAST --
SAY IT WITH ME, LEARNING CURVESARE FOR PUSSIES!
IT TURNS OUT --(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT TURNS OUT, WE HAVE ACTUALLYTRIED THIS ARMING REBEL GROUP
STRATEGY IN THE PAST.
BARACK OBAMA COMMISSIONED ASTUDY FROM THE CIA TO
EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF ARMINGSUCH REBEL GROUPS IN THESE
INTERVENTIONS.
YOU WILL NEVER GUESS WHAT THEYFOUND.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED FOR ASTUDY OF PAST INSTANCES IN WHICH
THE C.I.A. HAS WORKED WITHINSURGENTS AND REBELS AND FOUND
BASICALLY IT NEVER WORKED.
>> Jon: WHOA, WHAT!
THE C.I.A. STUDY FOUND IT NEVERWORKS?
THE C.I.A., THE ONES WHO HAVEBEEN DOING IT FOR THE PAST 65
YEARS, THAT'S LIKECOMMISSIONING DR. OZ FOR A
REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OFPOMEGRANATE DICK PILLS AND HIM
COMING BACK WITH IT'S BULL(BLEEP) BUT YOU DON'T MIND
IF I KEEP SELLING THEM, DO YOU?
THE C.I.A. REPORT DID FIND ONEEXCEPTION TO THE ARMING
INSURGENTS NEVER WORKS RULE.
WHEN THE C.I.A. COVERTLY ARMEDTHE MUJAHIDEEN REBELS IN THE
'80s AND THEY FOUGHT OFF SOVIETSSUCCESSFULLY.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THOSE GUYS?
>> THE MUJAHIDEEN IN AFGHANISTANWHO THE U.S. ARMED IN THE
1980s ONLY TO WATCH THEM MORPHINTO THE TALIBAN.
>> Jon: AND THAT IS THESUCCESS STORY.
AMERICA IS LIKE WILEY COYOTE.
EVERY TIME WE SEND A WEAPON TOTHE DESERT
IT ENDS UP WHERE WE DON'T WANTIT TO END UP!
BY THE WAY, WE'RE THE COYOTE INTHAT. IN FACT, A GOOD PORTION
OF THE BILLIONS IN WEAPONS WE'VE SENT TO THE IRAQIS
HAVE ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OFI.S.I.S., AND WITH SHIA MILITIAS
ACCUSED OF ATROCITY.
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN IRAQ NOTSWIMMING IN AMERICAN ARMAMENTS
ARE THE ACTUALLY PEOPLE WE ARETRYING TO ARM.
THE IRAQI ARMY LOST SO MUCHEQUIPMENT TO THE ENEMY THEY'RE
RESTRICTED TO SHOUTING BANG BANGIN TRAINING EXERCISES WHILE A
TRAINER BANGS A HAMMER AGAINST APOLE TO SIMULATE ENEMY FIRE, A
VERY EFFECTIVE TRAININGTECHNIQUE IF I.S.I.S. EVER
ATTACKS THEM WITH TRIANGLES!
SO THAT IS THE CURRENTSITUATION, THE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES OF GOOD GUY ARMEDINTERVENTION AND HOW DO WE GET
OURSELVES OUT OF THIS.
WELL, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT WHENIT COMES TO AMERICA IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, LEARNING CURVES AREFOR PUSSIES!
>> I THINK WE NEED TO ARM THEKURDS.
>> WE SHOULD ARM THE GUYSWILLING TO FIGHT THE KURDS AND
THE ANBAR SUNNI ARABS, WE'RE NOTDOING THAT.
>> I'M AN ADVOCATE OF ARMINGKURDS, THEY'RE VERY STRONG IN
SUPPORT OF OUR IDEALS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: (BLEEP), (BLEEP),
(BLEEP), (BLEEP)!
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: THIS WHOLE IRAQ
CLUSTER QUAGMIRE (BLEEP)CATASTROPHE STARTED IN THE
1980s WHEN AMERICA'S SOLUTIONTO THE AYATOLLAH WAS TO ARM AT
THAT TIME THE GOOD GUY IN THEREGION -- OR AS HE WAS KNOWN --
HMM -- SADDAM HUSSEIN!
WE SPENT THE '80s GIVINGSADDAM HUSSEIN'S BAATHISTS
WEAPONS TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIRANIANS.
THE '90s HELPING KUWAIT FIGHTAGAINST SADDAM'S BAATHISTS THAT
WE ARMED. THE 2000'S
HEADING A COALITION TO DESTROYSADDAM'S BAATHIST AND THE TEENS
FIGHTING AGAINST BAATHISTS NOWGOING BY THE NAME OF I.S.I.S.
THAT WE ORIGINALLY ARMED IN THEEIGHTIES TO FIGHT IRAN BUT TO
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE NOT EVENSKATED A MICROMETER OF THE
LEARNING CURVE, GUESS WHO OURNEW DESIGNATED GOOD GUY I
WITH A GUN IN THEREGION IS.
>> THERE'S A DE FACTOCOOPERATION BETWEEN IRAN AND THE
UNITED STATES.
>> IRAN IS DOING BATTLE WITHI.S.I.S. NOW WITH THE BLESSING
OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
(JON CURSING)(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)AMERICA IN THE MIDDLE EAST!
LEARNING CURVES ARE FOR PUSSIES,WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
