WE DON'T WANT FOOD STAMPRECIPIENTS EATING JUNK BUT WE
DON'T WANT THEM TAKING THE NICEHUMAN FOOD.
WHAT THE RIGHT MIXTURE OFQUALITY AND CLASS BASED SHAME
POOR PEOPLE SHOULD AIM FOR INTHEIR MEAL PLANNING?

MEATS THOSE TYPE THINGS.

[ LAUGHTER ]WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
SOMEBODY'S BIRTHDAY.

LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU HAVEYOURSELF A THREE COURSE MEAL.

RELATED PROBLEMS?
>> ON MY RADIO SHOW A GUY CALLEDIN WHO SAID HE OWNED FITNESS
CENTERS.
GOVERNMENT HAS EVEN ALLOWED FOODSTAMP RECIPIENTS TO USE THEIR
CARDS FOR FITNESS TRAININGPROGRAMS.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
[LAUGHTER]NOW FAR BE IT FOR ME TO
CRITICIZE FORMER REPUBLICANPRESIDENTIAL FRONT RUNNER HERMAN
CAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT FOOD STAMPS CANNOT BE USED
FOR FITNESS TRAINING PROGRAMS.
YOU ARE CONFUSING FOOD STAMPSWITH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OR STATE
FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDEVOUCHERS FOR FITNESS WHICH
FOR SOME REASON THINK IT MIGHTBE CHEAPER THAN HEARTTRANSPLANTS OR DIABETESMEDICATION.
FOOD STAMPS CAN BE USED FORFOOD.
THIS FACT YOU CAN REMEMBER WITHTHIS MNEMONIC I USED FOOD,FOOD
STAMPS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR FOODO-O DUMMY.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT'S A SIMPLE KNEW MNUEMONIC.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVEAN ISSUE WITH.

FOR GOVERNMENT TO PAY FORDIAPERS FOR LOW INCOMEFAMILIES WITH BABIES-- IF THEY
CHOOSE DIAPERS WHAT'S NEXTTOOTHPASTE, CAR SEATS?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: IF THESE POOR CHILDREN
ARE SAFE AND HYGIENIC, HOW WILLWE BE ABLE TO TELL THE STREET
URCHINS FROM THE NORMALS OTHERTHAN OF COURSE THEIR POCKETS
BURSTING WITH GOVERNMENTPROVIDED CRAB LEGS.
OBVIOUSLY THAT PUNDIT IS COMINGOFF RELATIVELY UNSYMPATHETIC.
WATCH THE REST OF THE PANELREMOVE THE QUALIFIER RELATIVELY.
>> IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THESE NEWFANGLED DIAPERS WHAT'S WRONGWITH
GOING BACK TO OLD SCHOOL.
IF SWADDLING CLOTHS WEREGOOD ENOUGH FOR BABY JESUS
THEY ARE PROBABLY GOOD ENOUGHFOR YOUR BABY, TOO.
>> Jon: IT'S LIKE THATBRACELET I HAVE, WWJS -- WHERE
WOULD JESUS SOIL?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]IT'S ABOUT A PHILOSOPHY ONE THAT
PRIZES SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND DESPISESGOVERNMENT DEPENDENCY.
>> IF WE WANT TO TEACH PEOPLE TOFISH GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY
AND NOT HAVE THEM DEPENDENT ONPRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> RONALD REAGAN USED TO QUOTE ASAYING IF YOU GIVE A MAN FISH HE
EATS FOR A DAY IF YOU TEACH AMAN TO FISH HE EATS FOR A
LIFETIME.
>> Jon: FINALLY CLARITY.
FOX DOESN'T MIND POOR PEOPLEEATING SEAFOOD AS LONG AS THE
POOR PEOPLE CATCH THE SEAFOODTHEMSELVES THEN OBVIOUSLY IT'S A

THE PERSON WITNESSEDPEOPLE USING FOOD STAMPSTO COME IN AND BUY
BAIT TO GO AND FISH WITH.
USING TAXPAYER MONEY TO BUYBAIT TO BASS FISH.

ANY SEAFOOD.
