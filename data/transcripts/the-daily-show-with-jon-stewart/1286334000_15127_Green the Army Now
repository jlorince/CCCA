THERE'S BEEN AN INTERESTING
DEVELOPMENT IN OVERSEAS.
AFTER PAKISTAN CLOSED A SUPPLY
ROUTE MILITANTS APPEARED AND ARE
ATTACKING THE TANKERS.
TO LIKE THE MILITANTS WERE
TIPPED OFF OR SOMETHING.
IT'S LIKE PAKISTAN IS PLAYING A
WEIRD GAME LIKE BACK STAB YOUR

CONVOYS TO ISLAMIC MILITANTS ON
A PLATTER WHICH IS WHY OUR
MILITARY IS DOING WHAT IT CAN TO
AVOID THIS IN THE FUTURE.
