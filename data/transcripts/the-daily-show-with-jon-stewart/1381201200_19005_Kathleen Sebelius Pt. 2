[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE TALKING TO SECRETARYSEBELIUS ABOUT HEALTH CARE.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY IT MAY SEEMI'M A LITTLE HARD ON THIS.
FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARESOMEWHAT BELIEVING THAT THE
OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW INWASHINGTON ARE CRAZY PEOPLE --
[LAUGHTER]-- IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS
GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT THATBASICALLY SAYS THIS FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY INPEOPLE'S LIVES, IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TODEFEND SOMETHING THAT IS LESS
THAN IDEAL, OR IS FUNCTIONING ATWHAT SEEMS TO BE A LEVEL OF
INCOMPETENCE THAT IS LARGER THANWHAT IT SHOULD BE.
SO IF YOUR ONLY OPTION IS CRAZYTOWN, THIS IS WHY I THINK PEOPLE
ARE CLINGING TO THIS.
BUT WHY -- LIKE THE 30 HOUR AWEEK THING.
BUSINESSES ARE CUTTING WORKERSHOURS BELOW 30 TO AVOID FACING
THE LAW OF OBAMACARE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
>> AGAIN, AT LEAST THEECONOMISTS, NOT ANECDOTAL FOLKS,
BUT ECONOMISTS SAY THERE'SABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT
PART-TIME WORK IS GOING UP.
IN FACT IT'S GOING DOWN.
THE HEIGHT WAS IN THE RECESSION.
IT'S GOING DOWN.
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER INTHIS COUNTRY, PART-TIME WORKERS
AND THERE'S A LOT OF PART-TIMEWORKERS THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
AND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE, WILLHAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING -->> YOU BET.
THEY'LL HAVE AN OPTION.
NOT THE EMPLOYER OFFERING HELPBUT --
>> Jon: THERE ARE PEOPLE THATWILL END UP IN DIFFICULT TIMES
HAVING TO SPEND MONEY THEY WOULDNOT HAVE SPENT, YES?
TO BUY HEALTH CARE IF THEY DIDNOT HAVE IT OR WANT IT?
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILLYES, PAY MONEY AND MANY OF THEM
WILL PAY LESS THAN THAN THEY PAYFOR CABLE OR CELL PHONE A MONTH.
>> Jon: BUT FOR SOMEONE WHOLOVES CABLE --
>> AND GOD KNOWS WE ALL DO.
I -- YOU KNOW, WE ALL DO.
>> Jon: BUT THE BASIC IDEA ISWHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE IS SOME OF YOUMAY FACE A PENALTY FOR THE
GREATER GOOD IS WHAT THE  SUGGESTION IS
>> IT ALSO IS WE DON'T GET TOPICK AND CHOOSE WHEN YOU GET
SICK.
>> Jon: NOW WE'RE GETTINGSOMEWHERE.
>> THE RULES OF THE COUNTRY AREYOU GO THROUGH THE EMERGENCY
ROOM DOOR, YOU GET TREATED ANDSOMEBODY PICKS UP THE BILL.
YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVESICKER AND DIE YOUNGER WITHOUT
INSURANCE.
>> Jon: WHICH IS WHY I DON'TUNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF STAYING
WITH A MARKET-BASED SOLUTIONFOR A PROBLEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T
BE SMART CONSUMERS THERE'S TOOMANY EXTERNALITIES IN HEALTH
CARE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHYBUSINESSES WOULDN'T JUMP AT THE
CHANCE TO DECOUPLE HEALTHINSURANCE FROM THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY AND WHY THEGOVERNMENT WOULDN'T JUMP AT THE
CHANCE TO CREATE A SINGLE PAYERSYSTEM THAT SIMPLIFIES THIS
WHOLE GARBLEY GUCK AND CREATESTHE PROGRAM THAT I THINK AMERICA
DESERVES.
-- I DON'T GET IT.
>> WELL --♪
♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: IT FEELS LIKE --AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE FACING THE
END OFWESTERN CIVILIZATION BY HAVING A
MARKET-BASED STRATEGY.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> WE ARE BRINGING WESTERNCIVILIZATION TO ITS KNEES BY
SELLING PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANSON A WEB SITE WHERE PEOPLE PICK
AND CHOOSE.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT.
I UNDERSTAND IF WE COULD HAVEPERHAPS FIGURED OUT A PATHWAY,
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A REASONABLESOLUTION.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS A SYSTEMTHAT HAS BEEN JERRY RIGGED TO
DEAL WITH THE CRAZY PEOPLE.
SO BY BENDING OVER TO DEAL WITHTHE CRAZY PEOPLE WE NOW FACE
DEFAULT.
HAS THAT TAUGHT A LESSON?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT DID NOTWANT TO DISMANTLE THE HEALTH
CARE THAT 85% OF THE COUNTRY HADAND START ALL OVER AGAIN.
THE END OF SIX MONTHS, WE HAVE26 WEEKS OF OPEN ENROLLMENT,
WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANSWITH AFFORDABLE.
>> Jon: CAN YOU RUN IT?
THE V.A. HAS HUGE PROBLEMS LIKE
I'M CONCERNED.
>> WE'RE NOT RUNNING THEINSURANCE PROGRAMS WE'RE
RUNNING -->> Jon: JUST THE ENROLLMENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT STARTED ROCKIER THAN WE WOULDLIKE.
>> Jon: WHY IS IT SO HARD?
>> IT'S BETTER TODAY AND IT WILLKEEP GETTING BETTER.
HELP IS THERE THAT'S NEVER BEENTHERE.
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR OWNDECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD FOR
THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.
>> Jon: YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY AND IHOPE THINGS WORK OUT SECRETARY
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS
