[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
TONIGHT'S GUEST -- WE HAVE AGOOD ONE UNIVISION AND FUSION
ANCHOR JORGE RAMOS IS JOININGUS.
FIRST IF IT TOOK YOU A
LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET YOURSAUSAGE McMUFFIN THIS MORNING
IT WASN'T BECAUSE THIS YEAR'SSAUSAGE CROP HAS SUFFERED A
PARTICULARLY POOR CONGEAL.
>> STAGING A WALKOUT SAYING IT'SNEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SURVIVE ON
$7.25 AN HOUR.
>> Jon: THE WAGES ARE SO LOWSOME FAST FOOD WORKERS HAVE HAD
TO RESORT A LIFE OF CRIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]OR WORSE PROSTITUTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]YOU HAVE A PRETTY MOUTH THERE
GRIMACE.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO THE QUESTION IS:  RAISE THE
MINIMUM WAGE FROM THE VERYDIFFICULT TO LIVE ON $7.25 AN
HOUR TO SOMETHING MORE LIVABLE.
IT SEEMS REASONABLE FOR ANINDUSTRY THAT IS THAT
PROFITABLE.
SO LET'S HEAR WHY IT WILLDESTROY THE VERY FOUNDATION OF
OUR DEMOCRACY.
>> LET'S GIVE PEOPLE MOREPURCHASING POWER.
>> THAT'S THE KEYNSIAN VIEW.
>> GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.
HOW IS THAT GOVERNMENT -- YESI'M SICK OF THESE WELFARE QUEENS
SUCKELLING AT THE TEET OF THEEMPLOYER THEY WORK FOR.
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT KICKING INTHE EXTRA MONEY BUT PAINTING A
RAISE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE ASAKIN TO WELFARE PALES IN
COMPARISON TO THE NEXT ARGUMENTWELL, THESE JOBS ARE SUPPOSED TO
SUCK.
>> I'M A BIG FAN OF EMPOWERMENTOVER ENTITLEMENT.
THESE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS ARE NOTMEANT TO BE LIFE LONG JOBS.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET YOURFOOT IN THE DOOR AND GET SKILLS.
>> IT'S LIKE A STARTER GIG..
A FRIER'S APPRENTICESHIP, IFWILL YOU.
A GRILL SQUIRE.
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU ARETHINKING.
JON, THESE ARGUMENTS AGAINSTRAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE ARE
ENTERTAININGLY (bleep) BUT IFEEL LIKE I NEED MORE OF THEM.
IS THERE ANY WAY I COULDSUPERSIZE THEM?
[LAUGHTER]WITH A SIDE OF SLIPPERY SLOPE.
>> WHAT SHOULD THE MINIMUM WAGEBE.
>> $15, $20.
>> WHY NOT $50.
>> WHY NOT RAISE IT AT $45 ANHOUR.
>> WHY STOP AT $15.
WHY NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGETO $100,000.
>> Jon: AND THEN --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]-- AND THEN --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WE COULD ALL LIVE LIKE KINGS.
[ LAUGHTER ]BURGER KINGS!
[LAUGHTER][ APPLAUSE ]
BUT LET'S -- LET'S FOR A MOMENTENGAGE HER ARGUMENT SEEING AS
SHE IS MAKING THIS ARGUMENT ON AFINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK.
THE REASON YOU DON'T RAISE THEMINIMUM WAGE TO $100,000 AN HOUR
IS BECAUSE IT WOULD BEUNREASONABLE ECONOMICALLY FOR
SOMEONE WORKING THEDRIVE-THROUGH TO MAKE $4 MILLION
A WEEK.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A
REASONABLE PLACE IN BETWEEN THE$290 A WEEK THEY MAKE NOW AND
THE $4 MILLION A WEEK YOUSUGGEST.
[ LAUGHTER ]PERHAPS WE CAN COME TO A
NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE.
