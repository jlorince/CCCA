YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYSSAID, INTOLERANCE SHOULD NEVER
BE TOLERATED, EXCEPT IF IT'SINTOLERANCE FOR THE ORIGINAL
INTOLERANCE, WHICH IS THEN ITHINK OKAY.
THE POINT IS INTOLERANCE ISWRONG USUALLY.
JASON JONES REPORTS ON ANUNUSUAL CASE.
>> OUR NATION HAS LONG BEENHAUNTED BY DISCRIMINATION.
AND WHILE WE'VE MADE GREATSTRIDES OVER THE YEARS
OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES, THEREARE STILL THOSE THAT SUFFER
FROM THE BARBS OF INJUSTICE.

ESTABLISHMENTS.

BECAUSE "WE DON'T DO THAT HERE."

>> YES.
>> YES, IT SEEMS EVEN IN THISDAY AND AGE, YOU CAN STILL BE
TREATED DIFFERENTLY JUST BECAUSEOF HOW YOU LOOK WEARING A $1,500
FACE COMPUTER.
SADLY GLASS-O-PHOBES LIKE TECHAUTHOR LARRY ROSEN ARE ALL TOO
COMFORTABLE TO OPENLYDISCRIMINATE.
>> I DON'T THINK WE'RE SEEINGDISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE
FOR WEARING GOOGLE GLASS.
>> I BET YOU DON'T THINK THEYSHOULD GET MARRIED EITHER?
>> I'M ACTUALLY VERY PROTECHNOLOGY, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE VIDEOTAPING YOU ORTAKING PICTURES OF YOU.

>> I CAN SEE THAT, EXCEPT THATYOU HAVE CAMERAS POINTED AT ME.
>> EXCEPT OUR CAMERAS HAVE REDLIGHTS AND BIG CREWS OPERATING
THEM AND YOU SIGNED A RELEASEFORM FOR A NATIONAL TV SHOW,
OTHERWISE EXACT SAME THINGYEAH.
THEY ALL HAD STORIES OFNAME-CALLING, DENIAL OF SERVICE
AT RESTAURANTS AND BARS, EVENASSAULTS ALL BECAUSE PEOPLE
THOUGHT THEY WERE BEINGSURREPTITIOUSLY  FILMED, WHICH
SOMETIMES THEY WERE.
>> I WAS AT BAR AND PEOPLESTARTED VERBALLY ACCOSTING ME.
THEY STARTED GETTING PHYSICALIMMEDIATELY WHEN I STARTED
RECORDING.
THEY RIPPED THEM OFF MY FACEBASICALLY AND THEY RAN OUTSIDE.
IT WAS HATE CRIME.
THE SILLY THING IS THAT THEY'REGOING TO BE WEARING THESE THINGS
PROBABLY IN A YEAR.
>> AND THESE PHILIP K. DICKSARE ON A MISSION TO BRING US ALL
INTO THE FUTURE.
LET'S PUT ASIDE THAT THESEGLASSES ARE JUST [BLEEPED]
STUPID.

YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT ME.
>> I'M LOOKING IN YOUR GENERALDIRECTION.
>> THE BEST USES OF GLASS TODAYARE APPS WHERE IT ACTS AS AN
INTERFACE BETWEEN YOUAND THE REAL WORLD.
FOR INSTANCE...

PHONE, OPEN THE APP.
>> IT'S USUALLY, OH, I GOT ANE-MAIL.
NOW I'M GOING TO SIT HERE.
>> ISN'T THAT JUST AS DOUCHEYAS...
>> HAVE YOU TRIED GLASS BEFORE?
>> I'VE NEVER WORN GLASS.
>> MAYBE THESE EYE DOUCHES WERERIGHT.
I COULDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WEREEXPERIENCING UNTIL I WALKED IN
THEIR SHOES.
BUT SINCE $1,500 IS ROUGHLY ADOWN PAYMENT ON A NEW CAR, I
MADE MY OWN.
AT FIRST I TRULY ENJOYED THEEASE OF USE.
OKAY, GOOGLE GLASS, FIND METHE BEST ESPRESSO -- OH, OUCH.
STOP STARING AT ME.
BUT SOON I WAS OPENLY HARASSED.
WHAT?
>> ARE YOU FILMING ME?
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN "YOUPEOPLE"?
PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE EYECONTACT WITH MY INVASIVE
HEADGEAR.
AND SINCE WHEN CAN'T A GROWN MANWALK INTO A CHILD'S PLAYGROUND
WITH A SECRET CAMERA ON HISFACE?
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS ASSUME THEWORST?
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

>> A GLASS EXPLORER.
>> AN EXPLORER?
>> CURRENTLY GLASS USERS ARECALLED GLASS EXPLORERS.
>> MAGELLAN WAS AN EXPLORER.
CHUCK YEAGER WAS AN EXPLORER.
