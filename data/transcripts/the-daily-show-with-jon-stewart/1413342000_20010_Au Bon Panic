AND THEN THERE'S, OH HOLY[BLEEP]. LOOK OUT, THERE WAS A
HAIR PIN TURN, YOU TRIED TO SLOWDOWN! BUT I COULDN'T --
THERE GOES THE EBOLA ALL OVER --[LAUGHING]
NOW AS OF NOW THE NURSE WHOCONTACTED THIS RARE DISEASE
AFTER VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITHTHE ONLY KNOWN WEST AFRICAN
CARRIER OF THAT DISEASEIN OUR COUNTRY IS STABLE
AND DOING "WELL."THAT'S FROM HER.
OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
>> ANOTHER CASE OF EBOLA INAMERICA.
>> A NEW CASE OF BOWLA.
>> A TEXAS HEALTHCARE WORKERDOES HAVE EBOLA.
>> SHOCKING HOSPITAL OFFICIALS.
>> FEARS THAT EBOLA COULDSPREAD.
>> WELL, NOW I'M SCARED AGAIN.
>> THE CDC STILL DOESN'T KNOWTHE POINT OF CONTACT.
>> THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS HOWDID SHE GET IT?
>> HOW DID SHE GET IT?
>> HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLYCONTRACT EBOLA?
>> Jon: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUPEOPLE?
[LAUGHING]SHE WAS A NURSE.
IN THE EBOLA UNIT, SHE TOOK CAREOF THE EBOLA MAN.
[LAUGHING]WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID

WERE EXPOSED TO DUNCAN BEFOREHE WAS ISOLATED.
>> Jon: ALRIGHT.
WELL, SIR, THE BAD NEWS YOUHAVE EBOLA, THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU

FOR GOD'S SAKES!
OH MY GOD!
IT'S WHAT RICK SANTORUM ALWAYSWARNED US ABOUT.
ONCE WE SANCTIONED GAYMARRIAGE NOW MEN ARE GIVING DOGS
EBOLA IN THEIR BUTTS. I REALLYFEEL LIKE ALL OF THESE NEWS
ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD JUST HIRE ANINE-YEAR-OLD TO SIT IN THE
CONTROL ROOM AND GO THAT LOOKSLIKE A PENIS IN THE BUTT.
CLEARLY THE NEWS ANCHOR ISHAVING TROUBLE DRAWING THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PERSONCONTRACTING THE DISEASE
AFTER WORKING IN CLOSE CONTACTWITH AN EBOLA PATIENT
AND THE INEVITABILITY ALL OF USGETTING IT NOW. RUN!
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,THERE HAVE BEEN EXPERTS ON YOUR
OWN CHANNELS TELLING YOU THATTHIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
>> YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO BEQUITE CLOSE AND IN QUITE INTENSE
CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY TO CATCHIT.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULTTO CATCH EBOLA.
IT'S RELATIVELY HARD TO SPREAD.
>> IT CAN ONLY BE PASSED ONTHROUGH BODILY FLUIDS LIKE
BLOOD.
>> THE REALITY IS WE'RE JUSTHEARING ABOUT ISOLATED CASES.
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ARE CLUSTERSOF PEOPLE COMING UP.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST.SCIENTISTS HAVE CRAZY HAIR AND
MUSTACHES AND WEAR GLASSES ANDLAB COATS. AND THEY'RE SO BUSY
AND ABSENT-MINDED THEY'LL JUSTPUT ANY OLD TIE ON.
COULD BE A BOW TIE FOR ALL IKNOW. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE ALWAYSTHINKING WITH THE --
THOSE GUYS, IF THOSE GUYSSAY IT'S OKAY -- FIND
ME ONE OF THOSE GUYS!
>> IT'S REALLY NOT GREAT CAUSEFOR CONCERN.
IT'S ALSO NOT VERY EASY TOTRANSMIT.
[LAUGHING][LAUGHING]
>> Jon: TOUCHE.
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I HAVETO GO BACK TO THE FLUBBER --
THESE - THESE EXPERTS ARE SOBORING.
ISN'T THERE SOMEONE WHO ISTECHNICALLY A DOCTOR
BUT WILL VALIDATE OUR HYSTERIA.
>> MY NEXT GUEST WROTE APROPHETIC BOOK ON EBOLA WAY BACK
IN 1987. ROBIN COOK'SBESTSELLING THRILLER "OUTBREAK"
IS A FICTIONAL VERSION OF ANEBOLA OUTBREAK IN AMERICA.
>> Jon: THAT WAS FICTION.
BUT FIRST THIS WEATHER REPORTFROM THE WRITER OF "SHARKNADO."
SO WE'VE HEARD FROM EXPERTS WHOSAY THIS IS A DANGEROUS BUT
MANAGEABLE SITUATION.
NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THEOPPOSITE OF AN EXPERT.
A CONGRESSMAN.
>> WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING THEADMINISTRATION TO REESTABLISH A
VIEW POINT ABOUT STOPPING THESEFLIGHTS TO THE UNITED STATES,
DALLAS, TEXAS, IS REELING FROMTHIS PROBLEM.
THAT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED WHEREIT IS, IN AFRICA.
>> Jon: THAT'S CONGRESSMAN PETESESSIONS, A REPUBLICAN FROM
TEXAS SUGGESTING WE CLOSEAFRICA'S DOOR AND HOPE
WHEN IT COMES OUT HOWEVERMANY WEEKS LATER
IT FEELS BETTER.
BUT HE MAKES A VALID IFHEARTLESS POINT.
WHY NOT JUST STOP LETTING PEOPLEFROM AFRICA FLY TO HERE?
>> IF PEOPLE CAN'T LEAVE THECOUNTRY BY AIR AND PEOPLE
ARE SICK. WHAT ARETHEY GOING TO DO?
THEY'RE GOING TO START GOINGINTO OTHER COUNTRIES BY LAND.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HARDER TOTRACE.
CONTRACT TRACE. WHICHWE KNOW IS THE TRIED AND TRUE
WAY OF STEMMING AN OUTBREAK.
>> Jon: OH RIGHT. QUARANTININGALL OF WEST AFRICA WOULD
PROBABLY MAKE THE SITUATIONWORSE. WHICH TO BE FAIR TO
CONGRESS IS WHAT THEY'REACCUSTOMED TO DOING.
>> I'M A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROMDALLAS, TEXAS, AND THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
AND MY JOB IS TO SPEAK FOR ANDTO HELP PROTECT AMERICANS.
>> Jon: THAT SOUNDS CALLOUS. BUTTHE VOTERS OF DALLAS DID ELECT
HIM ON THE SLOGAN, SESSIONSFOR CONGRESS, [BEEP] ALL Y'ALL.
[LAUGHING]BUT AGAIN CONGRESSMAN,
PERHAPS YOU WEREN'T LISTENING.
SANJAY GUPTA SAID THAT THATWOULD NOT PROTECT AMERICANS.
IT WOULD INCREASE THE RAGINGEPIDEMIC IN AFRICA AND MAKE IT
HARDER TO TRACK THEM. IT WOULDMAKE IT WORSE.
OH, MY GOD. DO YOU KNOW WHATTHIS MEANS?
CONGRESSMAN SESSIONS IS CARRYINGA DANGEROUSLY MUTATED
SANITY RESISTANT STRAIN OFFEAR THAT HAS GONE AIRBORNE.
BUT PERHAPS HE'S RIGHT. ARETHERE OTHER REGIONS SUFFERING
FROM DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND POORMEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT AMERICA SHOULD SHIELDITSELF FROM?
>> TEXAS HAS THE MOST NUMBER OFUNINSURED AMERICANS IN THE
WHOLE COUNTRY.>> IN TEXAS MORE THAN
32,000 PARENTS OPTED OUT OF ATLEAST ONE VACCINE.
>> TEXAS REFUSED THE MEDICADEEXPANSION, TURNING AWAY
$100 BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS.
>> THE FLU OUT BREAK IN TEXAS.
>> A MEASLES OUTBREAK INTEXAS.
>> 2,000 PEOPLE IN TEXASHAD WHOOPING COUGH.
>> IT'S AN EPIDEMIC IN TEXAS.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: ALRIGHT, TEXAS, HERE'S
THE DEAL.
WE CAN BUILD THAT BORDER FENCEYOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED.
WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO IT ALITTLE FARTHER NORTH.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
