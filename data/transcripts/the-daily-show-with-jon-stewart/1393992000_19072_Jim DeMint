[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FORMERREPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM THE
GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINACURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF
THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "FALLINGIN LOVE WITH AMERICA AGAIN."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM JIM DeMINT.
SIR --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGUS AGAIN.
THE BOOK IS CALLED FALLING INLOVE WITH AMERICA AGAIN.
SIR, I HAVE TO ASK -- HOW CAN WEWIN YOU BACK?
WHAT CAN WE DO?
HOW DID YOU FALL OUT OF LOVEWITH US?
DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE TOOK YOU FORGRANTED?
DO YOU FEEL LIKE --[LAUGHTER]
-- WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOUFEEL LIKE THE MAGIC WAS GONE?
>> WELL, JON, YOU KNOW WE'RE ALLBLESSED TO BE AMERICANS AND A
LOT OF US ARE WORRIED WE MIGHTBE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG FOLKSHERE TODAY BUT A LARGE MAJORITYYOUNG AMERICANS
SAY THEY NO LONGER THINK THEAMERICAN DREAM IS ATTAINABLE.
MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE LESSOPPORTUNITY IN THEIR LIVES THAN
THEIR PARENTS DID. THAT'S THEFIRST TIME IN HISTORY.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE ISREMIND AMERICANS THAT WE CAN
CHANGE THAT COURSE BUT WE HAVETO DO IT OURSELVES.
IT'S WHEN WE REMEMBER WE'RE AGROUND UP COUNTRY RATHER THAN A
TOP DOWN.
IT'S NOT POLITICAL OR PARTISAN.
WE WERE BUILT AS A NATIONDIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER NATION
BECAUSE WE WERE DECENTRALIZEDINDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES WORKING
TOGETHER WHAT WE CALL LITTLEPLATOONS.
IT'S WORKING ACROSS AMERICATODAY.
>> LITTLE PLATOONS?
>> YOU LIKE THAT WORD?
>> Jon: WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ISWE NEED MORE, I GUESS, COMMUNITY
ORGANIZERS?
[LAUGHTER]>> WE TALK ABOUT A LOT OF
COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS PEOPLE WHOSOLVE PROBLEMS, CREATE NEW
SCHOOLS, MORE CHOICES, A LOT OFPEOPLE HELPING TO SOLVE HEALTH
CARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.
STATES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA OPENINGTHEIR ENERGY CREATING A LOT OF
JOBS.
WE CAN SEE A LOT BETTERSOLUTIONS.
I'VE BEEN ON THE INSIDE, AS YOUKNOW OF CONGRESS.
I'VE BEEN OUT.
I'VE LIVED MOST OF MY LIFE OUTOF POLITICS.
THE SOLUTIONS ARE OUT OFWASHINGTON.
I JUST FEEL LIKE POLITICS ISDIVIDING THE COUNTRY.
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE THEY ARENOT NEARLY AS DIVIDED ABOUT
COMMON SENSE IDEAS.
I'M JUST OPTIMISTIC IF PEOPLESTART VOTING FOR THEMSELVES
RATHER THAN SOME CONCEPT OF WHATGOVERNMENT MIGHT DO.
>> GOVERNMENT HAS -- IF YOU ALSOPOLL PEOPLE THEY WOULD SAY,I THINK 65%,
70% SAY GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TOPLAY IN HELPING THOSE IN
POVERTY.
>> SURE, YEAH.
>> Jon: SHOULDN'T WE FOCUSON -- THE DIFFICULTY I HAVE IS
AT TIMES THOSE WHO FEELGOVERNMENT HAS LESS OF A ROLE TO
PLAY RATHER THAN REFORMING THEYABDICATE RESPONSIBILITY AND
OBSTRUCT. SO WHAT THEY DO IS
THEY CAUSE THE FUNCTION OFGOVERNMENT TO CEASE. AND
BY DOING THAT HURT A TREMENDOUSAMOUNT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT
REFORMING A SYSTEM THATDESPERATELY NEEDS SMART REFORM
AND NOT OBSTRUCTION.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.
OUR HEARTS, I THINK, ARE IN THESAME PLACE.
>> Jon: NO, THEY ARE NOT.
[LAUGHTER]>> OKAY.
>> Jon: CHEST WISE, YES,BIOLOGICALLY THEY ARE.
DIDN'T THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION
WASN'T IT YOUR FOUNDATION THATPROMOTED THIS IDEA OF
SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT?
>> NO, WE DIDN'T.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT YOU PROMOTEDTHAT.
>> WE DIDN'T THINK WE SHOULDPROCEED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF OBAMACARE.
IT WAS NOT READY FOR PRIMETIMEWE DIDN'T THINK IT SHOULD BE
FUNDED AND THAT WOULD DELAY IT.
OBVIOUSLY, SOME FOLKS HADDIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THAT.
THIS IS FUN RIGHT? THIS ISENJOYABLE?
>> IT IS ENJOYABLE.
>> Jon: WHEN WE WALK OUT OFTHIS I WILL UNDERSTAND A LITTLE
BIT BETTER OF WHERE YOU ARECOMING FROM AND YOU WILL JUST
FEEL SAD.
>> YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]I'LL GO HAVE SOME SEAFOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: COME ON.
[ LAUGHTER ]EXACTLY.
WHEN IS THIS DEBATE -- WHEN AREWE GOING TO HAVE A REAL DEBATE
ABOUT THIS AND NOT JUST ATALKING POINT FEST IN -- WHEN IS
THAT?
BECAUSE YOU SAY GOVERNMENT ISNOT ACCOUNTABLE BUT THEY ARE.
ELECTIONS ARE ACCOUNTABILITY.
THE FREE MARKET IS ACCOUNTABLETO MARKET FORCES BUT
OUR GOVERNMENT ISACCOUNTABLE TO US.
IT IS WHY I BELIEVE IT'S STILLON EFFECTIVE TOOL BECAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVE THATWE THE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE
CHANGES IN.
I CAN'T MAKE CHANGES TO PFIZEROR EXXON BECAUSE I'M NOT A BIG
ENOUGH SHAREHOLDER IN THOSE.
THIS COUNTRY, I CAN.
THAT'S WHY I THINK TO DEMONIZETHAT OR TO MAKE GOVERNMENT THE
PROBLEM IS TO ABDIGATE OUR OWNRESPONSIBILITIES.
>> I THINK IT'S THE POINT IF YOUDON'T RECOGNIZE WHERE THEY ARE
THE PROBLEM.
THEY ARE.
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M TRYING TOTO SHOW PEOPLE THERE'S SO MUCH
MISDIRECTION AND DECEPTION INCONGRESS IT'S HARD FOR VOTERS TO
KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.
>> Jon: I DO NOT DISAGREE.
>> JUST LIKE THE DEBT LIMITTHING THAT WENT THROUGH.
THERE'S A CONTROVERSY BECAUSETED CRUZ MADE THEM GO THROUGH
THE REGULAR PROCESS BUT IT WASTHE SAME
WHISPERS THAT GO ON.
IT GOES ON ALL THE TIME.
>> Jon: WHEN IS HE COMING ON?
DO YOU KNOW CRUZ?
HE WOULD HATE THIS.
>> HE WOULD LOVE THIS.
>> Jon: HE WOULD LOVE THIS.
>> HE AND -- YOU AND HE.
HE IS A GREAT GUY.
HE IS SMART AND NOT AFRAID OFTHE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: LET'S HAVE HIM ON TOHAVE A LOVELY CONVERSATION.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE.
>> I'M NOT HIS MANAGER BUT -->> Jon: NO, NO
-- NO, NO, NO.
THE BOOK IT IS INTERESTING AND IDO APPRECIATE YOU COMING BACK
AND HAVING THE CONVERSATIONBECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY DON'T
HAVE TO. THIS IS ANELECTIVE COURSE AND I
APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THEIRNEWS HERE, JON.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE SCARIESTTHING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY
LIFE.
"FALLING IN LOVE WITH AMERICAAGAIN."
MAYBE IF AMERICA MET US AT THEDOOR WEARING NOTHING BUT
SARAN WRAP.
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
JIM DeMINT.
