(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: BONJOUR! WELCOME
TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAMEIS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. YOU KNOWWHO'S ON THE SHOW TONIGHT THERE?
PROFESSOR X, ANDYOU MAY THINK TO YOURSELF
OH -- PATRICK STEWART. NO!
JAMES MCAVOY IS PROFESSOR X.
I JUST BLEW YOUR [BLEEP] MIND.
(LAUGHTER)YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW WEEKS
AGO ON THE PROGRAM,DO YOU WATCH THE PROGRAM?
(LAUGHTER)A FEW WEEKS AGO, OR YOU MAY NOT
REMEMBER, YOU MAY HAVEBEEN WATCHING BASKETBALL.
WE ADDRESSED A MINORINCIDENT IN OUR OTHERWISE
SPOTLESS DEPARTMENT OFVETERANS AFFAIRS.
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PHOENIXVA WORKERS FALSIFYING
PATIENT WAITING LISTS SOTHAT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
VETERANS HAD LONG WAITSBEFORE SEEING DOCTORS.
BUT THEY REALLY DID HAVE LONGWAITS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A GOOD
SYSTEM GIVE OR TAKE A COUPLEOF SCORES OF VETERANS IT MAY
HAVE KILLED.
I GOT SO MAD THAT I SCREAMEDINTO THIS JAR. IT IS A SWEAR
JAR THAT I WOULD SCREAMINTO.
IT'S PRETTY FULL NOW,UNFORTUNATELY.
LET ME JUST-- [BLEEP](LAUGHTER)
[BLEEP].
>> Jon: I THINK THAT MIGHTHAVE BEEN A THREE SYLLABLE
ONE, I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, GOOD NEWS, ACCORDINGTO VA SECRETARY ERIC
SHINSEKI'S CONGRESSIONALTESTIMONY LAST WEEK, MY VA
SWEAR JAR DAYS ARE OVER.
>> ARE PEOPLE QUOTE, UNQUOTE,COOK THE BOOKS?
IS THAT IN FACT A PROBLEMWITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE
SYSTEM?
>> I AM NOT AWARE AND OTHERTHAN A NUMBER OF ISOLATED
CASES WHERE THERE ISEVIDENCE OF THAT.
>> Jon: ISOLATED CASES,QUARANTINED.
SO THAT MAKES ME FEEL MUCHBETTER, UNLESS, AND I THINK
THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, ANEWS REPORT WOULD AIR, I
DON'T KNOW, THE EXACT SAMEDAY THAT SHINSEKI WAS
TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS,UNLESS A NEWS REPORT LIKE
THAT SAYS OTHERWISE.
>> IT'S ALLEGED THAT VAHOSPITALS IN AT LEAST EIGHT
STATES WERE HIDING VETERANSAPPOINTMENTS ON SECRET LISTS
TO IMPROVE HOSPITAL RECORDSON WAIT TIMES.
>> OH.
>> Jon: AT LEAST EIGHT STATES.HUH -- [BLEEP] [BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: IS BALLS REALLY A
SWEAR WORD? IS THAT-- I REALLYJUST COULD, I DON'T,
I DON'T KNOW HOWBALLS GOT IN THERE, QUITE
FRANKLY.
ACTUALLY, I DO NOW HOW BALLSGOT IN THERE.
(LAUGHTER)SO GENERAL SHINSEKI, BY
ISOLATED YOU MEANT THAT THEPROBLEM OF INADEQUATE
VETERAN HEALTH CARE WASISOLATED TO VETERANS.
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE SENIORVA MANAGEMENT IN 2010 SENT A
MEMO WARNING REGIONAL VADIRECTORS ABOUT
INAPPROPRIATE PRACTICESDESIGNED TO MAKE WAITING
LISTS LOOK SHORTER, EXCEPTTHEY DID.
OR THAT CBS NEWS OBTAINEDANOTHER MEMO FROM A VA
HOSPITAL EXPLICITLYOUTLINING HOW AND WHY
COLLEAGUES SHOULD GAME THEWAITING LIST.
>> IF WE EXCEED THE 14 DAYMEASURE FOR SCHEDULING
APPOINTMENTS, HE SAYS, THEFRONT OFFICE GETS VERY
UPSET.
HE OUTLINED A WAY TO GETAROUND IT.
WHEN PATIENTS CALLED FOR ANAPPOINTMENT THEY WERE NOT
BOOKED INTO THE COMPUTERUNTIL AN APPOINTMENT CAME UP
NO LATER THAN 14 DAYS AWAY.
THAT WAY THE MEMO SAYS YOUGET OFF THE BAD BOY'S LIST.
>> Jon: OH JESUS. BALLS!
YES, YOU WOULD GET OFF THEVA'S BAD BOY LIST.
BUT THERE'S THIS OTHERLIST.
PERHAPS WRITTEN MOREINDELIBLY. NO. I WAS ACTUALLY
THINKING OF THE BIG BOOK OFASSHOLES -- BY THE WAY
THE GUY ON THE COVER THERE, WEGOOGLED IMAGES OF ASSHOLES
AND THAT'S LIKE, THAT'S LIKE THESTOCK PHOTO THAT CAME UP.
SO I APOLOGIZE TO WHOEVERJUST THOUGHT SURE, I'LL FIX
MY HAIR, WHY NOT.
