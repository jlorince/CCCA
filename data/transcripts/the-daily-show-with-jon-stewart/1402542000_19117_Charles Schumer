>> WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SENIORUNITED STATES SENATOR
REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OFNEW YORK.
JOINING US VIA SATELLITE FROMWASHINGTON, D.C., WELCOME BACK
TO THE PROGRAM SENATOR CHUCKSCHUMER.
SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORJOINING US.
>> HI, JON.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> HEY, FIRST OF ALL, SENATOR,OBVIOUSLY THE GIANT NEWS DOWN
THERE IS THAT ERIC CANTOR HASLOST HIS SEAT.
I KNOW THAT HE IS A REPUBLICAN,BUT HE'S ALSO JEWISH IN THAT
INSTANCE.
DO YOU AND DEBBIE WASSERMANSCHULTZ DO YOU, IF I MAY SAY,
DO YOU POUR OUT A LITTLEMANISCHEWITZ FOR A HOMIE?
IS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE THERE?
>> NOT MUCH. NO.
>> Jon: NOT MUCH.
ALL RIGHT. NO LOVE LOST.
NO HAMANTASCHEN. NOTHING.
SO LISTEN, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TOOBVIOUSLY BE JOINING US HERE IN
NEW YORK.
YOU HAD TO STAY DOWN IN D.C.
BECAUSE OF A VOTE THAT WASANNOUNCED.
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
>> WELL, IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OFTHE SMALL BITS OF GOOD NEWS THAT
COMES OUT OF WASHINGTON.
WE VOTED TO PUT MONEY INTO THEVETERANS' HOSPITALS TO DEAL WITH
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE READABOUT.
THESE FOLKS WENT OVERSEAS, WEREINJURED, AND THEY DESERVE TO BE
TREATED AS BEST WE CAN.
AND, THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKETHAT HAPPEN.
IT WAS BIPARTISAN.
BERNIE SANDERS, LIBERALDEMOCRAT, JOHN MCCAIN,
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN GOTTOGETHER.
SO, IT WAS A RARE GOOD MOMENT.>> Jon: WHAT? THAT'S...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: THAT'S EXCELLENT.
NOW, IS THAT, IS THAT BILL...OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH
THE DETAILS OF THAT.
IS THAT CALLED THE 2014 "OH MYGOD, WHAT TOOK US SO LONG" BILL?
>> YOU MIGHT SAY THAT, YES.
>> Jon: IT IS UNBELIEVABLE ATTIMES WHAT IT TAKES TO GET SOME
KIND OF AGREEMENT.
I MEAN, THIS SCANDAL IS ABOUT ASEGREGIOUS AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY
GET.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: AND, HAS THIS TYPE OFFUNDING COME UP PREVIOUSLY AND
NOT BEEN ABLE? OR IS, OR IS...
>> YES.
>> Jon: OR IS THE BUREAUCRACYSO SCREWED UP THAT IT WOULDN'T
MATTER ANYWAY?
>> YEAH, WELL, NO. SENATORSANDERS ACTUALLY HAD A BILL ON
THE FLOOR A FEW MONTHS AGO ANDIT WAS DEFEATED, BUT AFTER THE
SCANDAL CAME ABOUT AND PEOPLE
SAW HOW AWFUL THE TREATMENT WAS,IT WAS PASSED.
AND, I'M GLAD IT WAS.
WE WORKED HARD TO PASS IT THEFIRST TIME.
WE FAILED.
SOMETIMES IN WASHINGTON YOU GOTTO KEEP TRYING AND YOU CAN
FINALLY GET SOMETHING DONE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. I THINK THE KEYWORD THERE WOULD BE "SOMETIMES."
SO WHAT WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE ISGOING ON DOWN THERE?
DO YOU HAVE... I KNOW THERE'S ACOLLEGE LOAN PROPOSAL.
THAT ALSO CAME UP TODAY.
>> WELL. WELL, YEAH THAT'STHE... THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.
IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT WEDID NOT GET ENOUGH VOTES ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TO PASSIT.
IT WAS BLOCKED.
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 40 MILLIONYOUNG PEOPLE IN AMERICA, I'LL
BET MANY ARE IN YOUR AUDIENCE,WHO OWE AN AVERAGE OF $30,000 IN
STUDENT LOANS.
>> Jon: DID YOU JUST CALL MYAUDIENCE DEADBEATS?
>> NO.
THEY'RE JUST TRYING SURVIVE LIKEEVERYBODY ELSE.
>> Jon: BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT'SHARD TO BELIEVE, YOU DIDN'T
ACTUALLY THINK THIS WOULD PASS,DID YOU?
>> WELL, WE HOPED IT WOULD.
THERE WAS SOME TALK THAT SOMEENOUGH REPUBLICANS WOULD JOIN
US. ONLY THREE DID.BECAUSE IT'S SO OBVIOUS,
THE GOVERNMENTIS ACTUALLY CHARGING YOUNG
FAMILIES, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO AREJUST OUT OF COLLEGE DOUBLE THE
GOING INTEREST RATE.
INSTEAD OF THE 3.5% THEY SHOULDCHARGE, THEY'RE CHARGE 7%.
THE PRIVATE BANKS ARE CHARGINGUP TO 14%.
SO PEOPLE WITH THIS HUGE BURDENOF DEBT ON THEIR BACKS ARE
PAYING MUCH MORE INTERESTTHAN THEY HAVE TO.
ALL WE WANT DO IS BRING ITDOWN TO THE 3.8% THAT IS THE
GOING INTEREST RATE.
YOU WOULD THINK EVERYBODY WOULDTHINK THAT WOULD BE FAIR AND
GOOD THING TO DO.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THEY DIDN'T..
WASN'T THE OBJECTION THAT THEYWERE GOING TO PAY FOR IT WITH
THE BUFFETT RULE, WHICH EVEN YOUSAID IS A NON-STARTER.
THAT'S NEVER GOING TO PASS.
>> WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE ANON-STARTER.
IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT PEOPLE WHOHAVE INCOMES OF OVER $1 MILLION
SHOULD PAY THE SAME TAX RATE ASMOST EVERYBODY ELSE PAYS, 30%,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T USE THELOOPHOLES. BUT WE TOLD THEM, IF
YOU HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO PAY FORIT, GIVE US AN EXAMPLE.
GIVE US SOMETHING TO WORK WITH.
AND THEY DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS HERE ISTHAT THE HARD RIGHT SAYS
THEY DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT DOINGANYTHING, EVEN HELPING PEOPLE
GET FAIR INTEREST RATE, A FAIRSHOT AT A GOOD INTEREST RATE.
AND TOO MANY OF THE REPUBLICANSFOLLOW THEM.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT... THEOTHER PLAN I THINK IS THE PETTRY
PLAN.
IT'S A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF ANOBAMA PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW
STUDENTS TO HAVE THEIR PAYMENTSPRORATED TO THEIR INCOME AND
THEN WITH A FORGIVENESS.
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTINGPROPOSAL.
>> IT IS.
>> Jon: DOES THAT HAVE ANYLEGS?
>> WELL, IT MIGHT.
YOU'D SAY YOU DON'T PAY FORCOLLEGE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE.
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO GETINTO COLLEGE AND THEN CAN'T
AFFORD IT AND DON'T GO OR DROPOUT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND, THIS WOULD SAY INSTEADOF PAYING UP FRONT, YOU PAY
ABOUT 3% OF YOUR INCOME.
IF YOU DO VERY WELL, DO YOU AWHOLE LOT.
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT WELL, YOUDON'T PAY THAT MUCH.
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEAWE'RE EXPLORING.
I THINK IT MAKES SOME SENSE.
>> ARE WE GOING BACKWARDS HERE?YOU KNOW,
WHY HAS COLLEGE EDUCATION GONEUP SO MUCH COMPARED TO ALMOST
ANY OTHER COMMODITY?
IS IT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS?
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BEDONE TO REIGN IN THE COST OF
COLLEGE?
IT SEEMS INEXPLICABLE THAT IT'SBECOME SO EXPENSIVE?
>> IT DOES.
WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE.
MY FATHER WAS AN EXTERMINATOR.
I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGEFROM A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH MONEY.
IF WE WERE... IF I WAS YOUNGTODAY, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO AFFORD IT. AND THECOST HAS GONE UP MUCH MORE
THAN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.
SO THERE'S SOME TALK OF SAYINGTHAT COLLEGES WON'T GET AID IF
THEIR TUITION GOES UP HIGHERTHAN THE RATE OF INFLATION.
>> Jon: IT'S GONE UP FARBEYOND THE RATE OF INFLATION.
>> YEAH YEAH, SO WE WOULD IMPOSETHAT.
NOW, YOU HAVE TO MAKEEXCEPTIONS.
WHAT IF THEY HAD A BIG BUILDINGPROGRAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHINGABOUT THE COST OF COLLEGE.
IT'S BECOMING... COLLEGE ON THEONE HAND IS BECOMING MORE AND
MORE OF A NECESSITY AND IT'SBECOMING LESS AND LESS OF
REALITY TO PEOPLE BECAUSEIT'S SO DARN EXPENSIVE
THAT EVEN PEOPLE WELL INTO THEMIDDLE CLASS CAN'T AFFORD IT.
BUT FOR THE MOMENT, AT THE VERYLEAST TO SAY PEOPLE SHOULD PAY
AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE, YOUCAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME, YOU CAN
REFINANCE YOUR CAR, BUT THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ALLOW
YOU TO REFINANCE YOUR COLLEGELOAN AND YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH?
WHY SHOULDN'T WE DO THAT?
I WOULD HOPE... WE'LL KEEP GOINGAT IT.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING THISBILL UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I HOPE PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHINGWILL E-MAIL THEIR SENATORS AND
CONGRESSMEN AND SAY, FOR GODSAKES, LET'S PASS THIS.
>> OK GIVE US, WHAT'S YOURE-MAIL?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
NEXT TIME YOU CAN COME AND JOINUS IN PERSON UNLESS OBVIOUSLY
THERE'S PRESSING SENATEBUSINESS.
I'M JUST KIDDING OF COURSE.
>> I'D LOVE TO BE WITH YOU INPERSON.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
