RELIGION TO CATCH IT.

AS THE ONLY AMERICAN IN THISROOM, I'M SCARED.
I'M ONLY A SHOE'S THROW AWAYFROM THE INCUMBENT

>> YEAH, I DON'T SPEAK ARABIC.
WE SPEAK PERSIAN IN IRAN.
>> I STUDIED ARABIC FOR 10MONTHS.
>> I ASSURED MY PRODUCER TIMGREENBERG THAT AS LONG AS HE WAS
WITH ME, THERE WAS NOTHING TOFEAR.

JON STEWART, LADIES ANDGENTLEMEN.
>> Jon:  OKAY, SO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> I WOULD SO VERY MUCH LOVE TO
SAY THAT TO HIM BUT I CAN'T.
>> IT'S EASIER WHEN YOU'RE NOTHERE ANYMORE.
>> IT REALLY IS.
>> John: SO LET'S TALK A LITTLEBIT ABOUT HOW THIS MESS AND THEN
THIS MOVIE BEGAN.
YOU FOUND MAZIAR FOR YOUR FIELDPIECE.
HOW DID YOU FIND HIM AND WHY DIDHE STAND OUT AS BEING SUITABLE?
>> WELL ONE OF OUR SEGMENTPRODUCERS SENT US A VIDEO THAT
MAZIAR HAD BEEN IN WHENHE SPOKE TO TED KOPPEL.
AND I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLYLOOKING AT THIS VIDEO, LOOKING
BACK, ALL THIS STUFF THAT HASHAPPENED THIS MOVIE, EVERYTHING,
LAST FIVE YEARS-- I REMEMBERTHAT MOMENT LOOKING AT THE
VIDEO, AND THINKING-- YEAH, THATWILL DO.
HE WILL DO.
AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THATMOMENT, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED.
>> John: BUT WHAT, WHAT-->> HE SPOKE ENGLISH.
>> John: RIGHT. BUT --
>> HE WAS LITERALLY THE ONLYPERSON WE FOUND IN IRAN WHO
COULD SPEAK ENGLISH.
>> BUT HE ALSO SPOKE TO WHAT YOUNEEDED TO HEAR AS WELL,
WHICH WAS POINTING OUT THAT OURPERCEPTION OF IRAN AND THE
REALITY WERE TOO VERYDIFFERENT THINGS.
>> YEAH, HE HAD A, HE WAS FROMIRAN BUT HAD, YOU KNOW, LIVED IN
LONDON AND HAD A LEG IN BOTHWORLDS AND COULD EXPLAIN THAT,
YES, EXACTLY, THAT ALTHOUGHTHERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEENS
OUR COUNTRIES, THERE ARE ALOT OF SIMILARITIES AND THAT
WAS EXACTLY ONE OF THE POINTS WEWERE MAKING GOING THERE.
>> John: SO HOW, YOU KNOW,IF, IF IRAN IS AS AFRAID
OF THE WESTERN MEDIA AS"ROSEWATER" MAKES IT CLEAR--
>> UNDERSTANDABLY.
>> John: WHY THE ( BLEEP ) DIDTHEY LET YOU IN?
NOT JUST BOTH OF YOU,SPECIFICALLY --
( LAUGHTER )SPECIFICALLY TIM GREENBERG.
SEEMS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE-->> I SEE WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING
HERE WITH THE "BERG" PART.
>> John: YEAH. HOW -- BUT WHYDID THEY LET YOU IN?
>> WELL THEY DIDN'T-- WELLHERE, FUNNY STORY.
AS WE LANDED IN TEHRAN, JASONJONES, THE CANADIAN WALKED RIGHT
IN AND SIPPED TEA WITH THELOCALS.
TIM GREENBERG OF JEWISH DESCENTAND AMERICAN WAS PULLED ASIDE
FOR AN HOUR.
>> YEAH, SEE I DIDN'T THINKTHAT WAS SO FUNNY, ACTUALLY.
ALTHOUGH, AS SOON AS WE GOTDOWNSTAIRS THEY TOOK ME INTO
THIS SORT OF SIDE ROOM WITH TWOSECURITY GUARDS AND THEY
STARTED WATCHING SOCCER ANDCOMPLETELY IGNORED ME.
SO I FIGURED ALRIGHT, THIS WON'TBE THAT BAD.
AND IN FACT, OUR TIME THEREWAS JUST THAT. IT REALLY WAS,
IT FELT LIKE IT WAS A FINE PLACEFOR US TO BE.
WE DID NOT FEEL THREATENED.
WE DID NOT FEEL THAT BASICALLYWHAT WAS ABOUT TO COME A FEW
WEEKS LATER, WE DID NOT REALLYSENSE.
THERE WAS A SLIGHT SENSE OF ASOCIETY OPPRESSED, VERY SLIGHT,
BUT GENERALLY, WE WERE ABLE TOGET AWAY WITH ALL THE KINDS OF
STUFF WE DO ON THE "DAILY SHOW."
>> WE GOT A LITTLE TIP-OFF INTHE LITTLE SCENE WE SHOWED
PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH THE KIDS.
WE WERE IN A TOWN CALLEDISFAHAN, VERY HOLY TOWN AND
OUR FIXER CAME RUNNING UPTO US. HE WAS LIKE, WE HAVE TO
LEAVE NOW. QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.
AND WE LIKE OKAY YEAH, WE'LLLEAVE THE HOLY SQUARE.
AND HE NO, THE CITY. THE CITY.
WE'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THECITY.
>> John: HOLY ( BLEEP ).
>> APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWEDTO PLAY FOOTBALL IN THEIR
HOLIEST OF HOLY SQUARES.
>> John: TO THROW A PIGSKINAROUND.
>> A PIGSKIN. A PIGSKIN, YES.
>> WHEN WE WERE LEAVING HE MADEIT VERY CLEAR, WE WERE LIKE,
SO ARE WE JUST DONE WITH THATLOCATION?
HE WAS LIKE, NO, YOU CANNOTRETURN TO THAT CITY AT ALL.
>> YES. YOU WILL NEVER BEALLOWED BACK IN ISFAHAN
EVER AGAIN.
>> John:  I GUESS BASICALLYCONSIDERATIONS ARE IN ORDER.
YOU GOT A SPIN-OFF.BECAUSE SNL DOES SPIN-OFFS ALL
THE TIME, "WAYNE'S WORLD,""BLUES BROTHERS" AND IT
SEEMS ONLY FITTING THAT THE"DAILY SHOW" GETS A SPIN-OFF
INVOLVING AN IRANIAN JOURNALISTBEING TORTURED.
>> THAT WAS OUR MISSION.>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> John: TIM GREENBERG AND JASONJONES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
