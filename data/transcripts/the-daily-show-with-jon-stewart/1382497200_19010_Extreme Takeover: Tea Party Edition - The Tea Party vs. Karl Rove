[LAUGHTER]OF COURSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
OFBRAIN, IT'S ARCHITECT -- ELY'SBLOSSOM DEL TURDO
HAS A PLAN TO FIX ALL THIS.
AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW HIS PLANINVOLVES SENDING MONEY CARE
OF EL BLOSSOM DEL TURDO.
>> KARL HAS HELPED LAUNCHCONSERVATIVE VICTORY PROJECT
THAT MADE THE TEA PARTY ANDTHOSE WHO SUPPORT THAT PART OF
THE PARTY VERY UPSET.
>> OUR OBJECT IS TO AVOID HAVINGSTUPID CANDIDATES WHO CAN'T WIN
GENERAL ELECTIONS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: OH, AND TO MAKE THIS
COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE FOR THECITIZENS.
NO IT'S ACTUALLY THE ELECTIONSTHING.
THE GOAL OF MR. ROVE'SCONSERVATIVE VICTORY PROJECT IS
TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATES WITH BONATFIDE CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALSNA
WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING FROMTHE CONSERVATIVE BASE
SO THEY ARE CONTROLLABLE.
BECAUSE ROVE KNOWS THE CRAZYTALK IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SAID
OUT LOUD.
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEEMS TOHAVE HURT ITSELF.
THAT'S WHAT THE POLLS SAY.
AND YOU SAY?
>> THAT'S ACCURATE.
LOOK, WE -- REPUBLICANSAND CONSERVATIVES ANGRY
OVER THE VICTORY OF PRESIDENTOBAMA WANTED SOMEBODY
TO STAND UP AND FIGHT.
THE DEFUND STRATEGYWAS NEVER GOING TO WORK.
>> Jon: THANK YOU COMMANDERHINDSIGHT.
LISTEN, BILL, I TOLD THEM ITWASN'T GOING TO WORK.
I CALLED A GUY AND SAID A LONERANGER MOVIE IN 2013.
AND THEN I SAID TO STEVE JOBS,NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE PICTURES
WITH THEIR PHONES, I MEAN.
CANCEL THAT WHAT I SAID TO STEVEJOBS WAS SURE WISH I COULD FIT
ALL MY PHONES IN MY POCKET.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT THE SHUTDOWN, IT'S TOO
UNCOMPROMISING, FOCUSED TOO MUCHON STOKING THE ANGER OF THE
REPUBLICAN BASE OVER OBAMACAREWITHOUT AN EXIT STRATEGY.
IT'S AS THOUGH THE ENTIREMISGUIDED SHUTDOWN AFFAIR WAS A
CULMINATION OF A DECADE LONGSTRATEGY TO ENGAGE THE MOST
RIGID AND IDEOLOGICAL POCKETS OFREPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH IS WHY
KARL ROVE HAS NO RIGHT TOCOMPLAIN ABOUT THE RADICALS
RUINING HIS PARTY BECAUSE HE ISTHE ONE WHO INVITED THEM.
I GIVE YOU BUILDING RED AMERICABY TOMMY EDSALL.
DURING THE 2004 ELECTION OLDCAPTAIN RETROSPECTIVELY OBVIOUS
SET OUT THE G.O.P. STRATEGYOF -- QUOTE -- "ACTIVATING
CONSERVATIVES ANGER POINTSRATHER THAN REACHING OUT TO
MODERATES."  ANGER POINTS LIKEFREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS AND SAME-SEXMARRIAGE.
LEADING TO SCENES LIKE THIS ASENATOR FROM ROVE'S HOME STATE
SHARING A STAGE AT ARALLY WITH THIS GENTLEMAN.
>> WE'RE RULED, QUOTE UNQUOTE,BY A PRESIDENT.
>> IMPERIALIST PRESIDENT.
>> WHO BOWS DOWN TO ALLAH.
I CALL UPON ALL OF TO YOU WAGE AI SECOND AMERICAN NON VIOLENTE A
REVOLUTION, TO USEDISOBEDIENCE AND DEMAND
THAT THIS PRESIDENT LEAVE TOWN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]TO PUT THE -- TO PUT THE KORAN
DOWN, TO GET UP OFF HIS KNEESAND TO FIGURATIVELY COME UP WITH
HIS HANDS OUT.
>> Jon: THERE ARE SO MANYTHINGS WRONG WITH THAT,
FACTUALLY, IDEOLOGICALLY,GRAMMATICALLY --
[LAUGHTER]-- MEANWHILE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY BEHIND HIM
IS LIKE SHUT THE (bleep) UP SOWE CAN BID ON THOSE STORAGE
CONTAINERS.
OLD TURD BLOSSOM HERE HAS TOCREATE A SUPER PAC TO ATTEMPT TO
BATTLE THE STUPID HE HIMSELFUNLEASHED SO NO SIMPATICO FOR A
GUY WHO STARTED A FIRE THAT NOWRAGES OUT OF CONTROL.
[ APPLAUSE ]PERHAPS THE SINGLE LEAST SELF
EXAMINING CRAZY ENABLER IS THEINCREASINGLY SENIOR SENATOR FROM
ARIZONA WHO HAS THIS TO SAYABOUT HIS COLLEAGUE'S
UNCOMPROMISINGSHUTDOWN STRATEGY.
>> WE'RE SEEING THE END OF THISAGONIZING ODYSSEY.
IT'S ONE OF THE MORE SHAMEFULCHAPTERS I'VE SEEN IN THE YEARS
I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE.
>> SENATOR McCAIN CALLING SOMEOF HIS COLLEAGUES WACKO BIRDS.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T GET TOCOMPLAIN AT ALL BECAUSE IF I
REMEMBER CORRECTLY NOMATTER HOW
COOKOO FOR COCOA PUFFS YOURCOLLEAGUES ARE THEY DON'T COME
CLOSE TO YOUR HATCHLING.
>> GOVERNOR PALIN FROM THE GREATSTATE OF ALASKA.
>> Jon: YOU OPENED PANDORA'SBOX.
BYOU WERE THE GUY THAT GAVE THEMOGWAI
A POST MIDNIGHT ALL YOU CAN EATBUFFET.
YOU DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN THATTHE PARTY IS OVERRUN WITH
GREMLINS.
