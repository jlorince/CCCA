>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
LAST WEEK, WE DID-- LAST WEEK, ITHOUGHT A VERY NICE PIECE ON THE
SHOW ABOUT HOW FOX NEWS WANTEDPEOPLE TO APOLOGIZE FOR RUSHING
TO JUDGMENT ON THE FERGUSONSHOOTING OF MICHAEL BROWN.
AND SO WE I THINK QUITE CLEVERLYDREW AN ANALOGY TO THAT
AND THEIR RUSH TO JUDGMENT ONBENGHAZI, IT WAS REALLY QUITE
DROLL.
NOW WHILE FOX NEVER ADDRESSEDOUR BENGHAZI POINT,
IT APPEARS NOW THEY'RE ASKINGFOR MORE THAN AN APOLOGY.
>> PETE WILLIAMS, TO HIS CREDIT,GOT THAT BOSTON MARATHON TERROR
REPORTING DEAD ON.
AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAILEDHIM AS A HERO FOR GETTING IT
RIGHT, WHICH HE DID.
FOX NEWS GOT THIS CASE RIGHT.
FOX NEWS, NOT JUST ME.
SEAN HANNITY HAD A LOT OFSEGMENTS, PLUS O'REILLY HAD A
LOT OF SEGMENTS, URGING CAUTION.
WOULD THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVERHAIL THEM AS HEROES LIKE WE
HEARD ABOUT PETE WILLIAMS?
>> Jon: YEAH, WHY DOESN'T FOXGET AS MUCH CREDIT AS-- WHO'S
PETE WILLIAMS?
( LAUGHTER )ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, IT WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME THEY GOT ITRIGHT.
>> I URGED CAUTION IN THE DUKECOVERAGE, AND IN THE TRAYVON
MARTIN COVERAGE, AND NOW THISCOVERAGE.
>> Jon:  THAT'S THREE TIMES.
THEY GOT IT RIGHT THREE TIMES IN10 YEARS.
THOSE ARE SOLAR ECLIPSE NUMBERS,PEOPLE, WHICH I THINK IS WHY
IT'S RECOMMENDED YOU ONLY WATCHFOX THROUGH A TINY PINHOLE POKED
IN A PIECE OF CARDBOARD.
YOU CAN'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT FOX.
IT WILL INDELIBLY BURN YOURSOUL.
WHILE OF COURSE THE WHOLERUSH TO JUDGMENT COMPLAINT IS
( BLEEP ), FOX IS NOTHINGBUT A RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN
ALMOST EVERY SITUATION.
OKAY.
YOU'RE THE CAUTION AND SOBERREFLECTION NETWORK.
( LAUGHTER )BUT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE
PIECE WAS AFTER 10 MINUTES OFCOMPLAINING THAT NO ONE WOULD
EVER THANK THEM, THIS.
>> IF YOU ARE WAITING FOR THEMAINSTREAM MEDIA TO SAY NOT ONLY
THAT WE WERE WRONG IN THISRACIALLY CHARGED CASE THAT
RESULTED IN SO MUCH VIOLENCEIN THAT TOWN AND TO CREDIT
FOX NEWS FOR BEING RIGHT,YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD YOUR
BREATH A LONG TIME.
>> WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon:  RIGHT, YOU DON'T
CARE, IN THE SAME WAY MY MOMDOESN'T CARE IF I EVER CALL.
( LAUGHTER )SURE, CALL OR NOT.
I COULD JUST SIT HERE AND DIE. ( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE POINT IS, THE POINT ISYOU WERE RIGHT,
AND THAT IS NEWSWORTHYWHEN FOX IS RIGHT.
AND CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION.
SO TO HONOR THAT TIME YOU WERERIGHT, WE GOT YOU A FUDGIE THE
WHALE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHY, WE THINK
YOU'RE A WHALE OF A NETWORK!
IN THAT WE'VE BEEN CHASING YOUOUR WHOLE LIVES AND JUST CAN'T
KILL YOU.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, FOX.
IN HONOR OF THIS SINGULARACHIEVEMENT OF YOU BEING RIGHT,
LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD HAS SOMETHINGTHEY'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.
HOLLYWOOD.
>> I'M GEORGE LUCUS AND I'M HERETO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM ONLY
GOING TO MAKE MOVIES FROM NOWON THAT ARE BLINDLY
UNCRITICAL OF AMERICA.
LIKE "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,JUSTIFIABLY".
"AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISMGRAFFITI."
"STAR WARS, THE REAGAN MISSILEDEFENSE VERSION."
AND "THE CLINTON MENACE."
FOX NEWS, MAY YOU LIVE LONG ANDPROSPER.
WAIT, I DIDN'T WRITE THAT, DIDI?
>> Jon: SORRY. BUT THE TRUTH ISTHIS--
( APPLAUSE )FOX, WE CAN SEND YOU ALL THE
CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES ANDPRAISE WE CAN MUSTER, BUT IT'S
REALLY JUST GOING TO PALE INCOMPARISON TO HOW YOUR BIGGEST
FANS FEEL ABOUT YOU, ANDSO WE HAD THEM TAPE SOME
MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATIONS ASWELL. TAKE A LOOK.
>> ONE NETWORK HAS TRANSFORMED,REENVISIONED AND REINVENTED THE
WAY NEWS IS DONE.
>> FOX IS THE DOMINANT FORCE INBROADCAST NEWS TODAY.
>> WE'RE THE ONLY NETWORK THAT'STELLING THE TRUTH RIGHT NOW.
