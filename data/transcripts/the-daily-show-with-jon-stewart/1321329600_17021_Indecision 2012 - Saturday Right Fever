COMEDY CENTRAL
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT.
NOBEL PAEZ PRIZE WINNER LEYMAH
GBOWEE GOING TO BE JOINING US
ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
THE PRESSING QUESTION IS HOW
DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE HAD TOO
MANY DEBATES?
HERE'S A CLUE.
SATURDAY NIGHT'S,000th
REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS AN
HOUR-AND-A-HALF.
BUT CBS ONLY AIRED ONE HOUR OF
IT SO THEY COULD STILL BRING
YOU, THE VIEWER, A FRESH
N.C.I.S. RERUN.
CBS WANTED PEOPLE TO LEARN
SOMETHING.
ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN
WORK.
ALL RIGHT.
BUT THE FIRST HOUR STILL
PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
FOLLOW COMPELLING STORY LINES.
WOULD GINGRICH'S RECENT POLL
SURGE CONTINUE.
DOES ME SAYING POLL SURGE MAKE
YOU THINK OF HERMAN CAIN?
WOULD RICK PERRY FINALLY THINK
OF THAT THIRD THING?
IF YOU BET RON PAUL WAS OVER
90 SECONDS OF SPEAKING TIME,
WOULD YOU LOSE THAT BET?
THE ANSWER IS YES, YES, AND...
MOST IMPORTANTLY HAS MITT
ROMNEY'S STUDY OF HUMANS PAID
OFF.
COULD HE MANIPULATE HIS FACIAL
STRUCTURE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO
AAPPEAR TO BE LISTENING TO HIS
OPPONENTS INTENTLY YET
SKEPTICALLY.
NO, THAT SAYS MORE LIKE I'M
PRETENDING I'M WATCHING A
PUPPY PLAY WITH A BALL.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS I BELIEVE WHAT I SMELL
IS POPCORN.
THAT ONE SAYS I'M CURRENTLY
WATCHING A WOMAN CRUSH A SMALL
ANIMAL WITH HER HEEL.
OR RICK PERRY.
IT'S CALLED MITT FACE.
IT'S SWEEPING THE NATION.
OR AT LEAST IT WAS UNTIL HIS
CAMPAIGN GOT AN INJUNCTION
FROM THE PRODUCERS OF THE
INDIE HORROR FILM MITT FACE.
A BASEBALL PLAYER INVOLVED IN
A HEAD-ON COLLISION AT THE
PLAY AT THE PLATE ENDED UP
WITH MITT FACE.
I'M NOT SURE WHY I HAD TO YELL
THAT AT YOU.
ON THE TO THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE
OF THE DEB.
THE SUBJECT WAS FOREIGN
POLICY.
ALL THE CANDIDATES SEEMED TO
AGREE AMERICA TO NEEDS TO
START KICKING THE WORLD'S ASS
AND TAKE SOME FUNNY SOUNDING
NAMES.
>> WE HAVE TO HAVE CHINA
UNDERSTAND THAT LIKE EVERYBODY
ELSE ON THE WORLD STAGE THEY
HAVE TO PLAY BY THE RULES.
>> THE CORRECT THING IN AN ACT
OF WAR IS TO KILL PEOPLE WHO
ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.
>> FOR EVERY COUNTRY THE
FOREIGN BUDGET WILL START AT
ZERO DOLLARS.
>> Jim: I THINK I HAVE THE
REPUBLICAN TAKE ON FOREIGN
POLICY.
IT'S, OH, WHAT IS IT?
BOOM, B AND-BOOM.
CHINA, IRAN, PAKISTAN.
BA-BOOM.
WE'RE BACK, BABY.
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, CRAZY GAZER SATAN LADY.
YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING.
>> I WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THAT
ASSESSMENT TO PULL ALL FOREIGN
AID FROM PAKISTAN.
>> Jon: LADY WHO BELIEVES HP-
VACCINES CALLED RETARDATION.
WHAT?
>> PAKISTAN HAS A NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
THE NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF
HAS TO UNDERSTAND FROM DAY ONE
THE INTRICACYS THAT ARE
HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
BECAUSE ALL THE CRAZY (BEEP)
YOU SAY, IT'S EASY TO FOR GET
YOU SIT ON THE COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE.
YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT PAKISTAN.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE REASONABLE.
LET'S GO TO THIS GUY RICK
SANTORUM.
GIVE US FOREIGN POLICY RED
MEAT, BROTHER.
>> YOU DON'T COW BOY THIS ONE.
YOU DON'T FLY INTO PAKISTAN
AND TRY TO INTERDICT A NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE
PEOPLE IN POWER IN THE
GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: (BEEP)?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WERE ON THE SENATE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE SO YOU KNOW
PAKISTAN AND IRAN ARE
COMPLICATED ISSUES.
IF ONLY EVERYTHING WAS AS
SIMPLE AS GAY PEOPLE ARE
ANIMALS.
YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING.
AT LEAST NO ONE IS GOING TO
CHALLENGE MITT ROMNEY'S CHINA
BETTER WISE THE (BEEP) UP,
RIGHT?
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS
COUNTRY NEEDS A TRADE WAR WITH
CHINA.
>> Jon: UNLESS YOU SEE BECAUSE
WE NEED A REAL WAR WITH CHINA.
>> WHO DOES IT HURT?
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
CHINA?
FORMER AM
