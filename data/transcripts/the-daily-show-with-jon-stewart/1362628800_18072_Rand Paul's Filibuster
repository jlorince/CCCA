[LAUGHTER]
REAL QUICK OFF THE TOP, TODAY JOHN BRENNAN WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIS NOMINATION TO RUN THE C.I.A.
ON FIRMED IN THE SENATE.
SORT OF A NONEVENT AFTER THE RECENT CONFIRP -- CONFIRMATION DRAMA -- WHAT THE WHO?
IT WAS A NONEVENT UNTIL THE --
>> I RISE TODAY TO FILIBUSTER THE NOMINATION TO THE C.I.A.
>> Jon: LOOKS LIKE WE GOT US A GOOD OLD FASHION TALKIE FILIBUSTER, THE KIND OUR
GRANDPARENTS TRIED TO TELL US ABOUT BUT NEVER GOT TO BECAUSE WE WERE TOO BUSY PLAYING JACKS AND TIDDLY
WINKS WITH OUR FRIENDS WAITING FOR OUR CHANCE TO FREEBASE IN THE SHED.
AH, THE 70s OR 50s OR WHATEVER TIME FRAME I APOO PEER TO BE.
RAND PAUL HAS SENT A LETTER TO ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER ASKING JUST A SIMPLE
QUESTION:  CAN THE PRESIDENT USE A DRONE TO TAKE OUT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN ON U.S.
SOIL?
YOU WOULD THINK HE WOULD GET A LETTER BACK LIKE, NO, WAY!
HOLDER WRITES HIM BACK A LETTER THAT NEVER DIRECTINGLY ADDRESSING THE QUESTION KIND OF, SORT OF
IMPLIED HYPOTHETICALLY IN THE RIGHT -- YES, WE CAN DO THAT PROBABLY WON'T BUT YES.
SENATOR RAND PAUL TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF THE EXECUTION OF EXECUTIVE EXECUTIONS EXECUTED THE
CLASSICAL FILIBUSTER.
I MEAN HE'S OUT THERE TALKING.
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE -- I MEAN HE'S USING THE FILIBUSTER THE WAY IT'S MEANT TO BE USED.
>> I WILL SPEAK UNTIL I CAN NO LONGER SPEAK.
I CAN -- IS THES BUT OF THE PROPELLERS OF DRONES.
IN GENERAL HAS ALLOWED PRESIDENT TO USURP THIS POWER.
FLASHCARDS, ALARM BELLS SHOULD GO OFF.
JUDGES AND JURIES MAKE MISTAKES.
WHO COULD FORGET JANE FONDA AROUND IN NORTH VIETNAMESE.
YOU ARE GOING TO DROP A DRONE HELLFIRE MISSILE ON JANE FONDA.
>> Jon: NO.
OF COURSE NOT.
HOWEVER MUCH YOU WOULD HAVE DISAGREED WITH HER POSITION I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
SHE'S ALREADY PAID A HELLISH
