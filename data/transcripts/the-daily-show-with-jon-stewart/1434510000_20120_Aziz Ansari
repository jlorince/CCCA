>> IT IS.
YEAH.
>> Jon:  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
( LAUGHTER )
>> I GOTTA, LIKE, THE NEXT ONEI SHOULD-- EVERYONE WRITES THESE
KIDS BOOKS, I'M LIKE, DAMN IT.
THAT IS SO MUCH EASIER THANSPENDING TWO YEARS DOING A
SCIENCE PROJECT.
I SHOULD HAVE JUST WRITTEN ADAMN KIDS' BOOK.
BUT IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
I'D BEEN DOING MATERIAL ABOUTKIND OF THESE ISSUES.
AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO MEWAS WORKING WITH A SOCIOLOGIST
AND, LIKE, REALLY FIGURING OUTTHE HEART OF THESE ISSUES THAT I
WAS TALKING ABOUT IN MY STAND-UPAND INTERVIEWING HUNDREDS OF
PEOPLE ABOUT IT.
IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING.
I FEEL LIKE I LEARNED A LOT.
>> Jon:  AND TRAVELING.
YOU WENT AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Jon:  WHAT DID YOU LEARNWORKS AND DO YOU USE IT TO GET
LAID?
( LAUGHTER )
>> UM, I-- I HAVE A GIRLFRIENDRIGHT NOW SO THAT-- THAT--
THAT-- SOME OF THE STUFF DOESN'TAPPLY TO ME.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  LIKE THE STUFFABOUT... THAT?
>> YEAH.
I'M NOT USING IT TO, LIKE --
>> MEET GIRLS.
>> GET LAID WITH OTHER WOMENWHILE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.
I'M NOT DOING THAT.
THAT WOULD BE BAD.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> BUT--
( LAUGHTER )
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT.
>> Jon:  WHY WOULD YOU PUTIN TWO YEARS OF EXTENSIVE
RESEARCH TO FIND OUT IN THE MOSTMINUTE STATISTICAL DETAIL WHAT
IS A MORE EFFECTIVE TINDERPICTURE, AND THEN WHY WOULD YOU
THEN USE THAT?
MAKES TOTAL SENSE--
>> TO HELP THESE GUYS, MAN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE THE SANTA CLAUS, YOU'RETHE SANTA CLAUS OF MODERN DATING
NOW.
WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT SHOCKEDYOU, THAT YOU HAD PRECONCEIVED
NOTIONS YOU HAD IN YOUR ACT ANDNOW HAVE TO REBOOT?
>> WELL, WHEN I WENT TO JAPAN IDEFINITELY THIS THOUGHT OF, OH,
THAT'S SUCH A TECHNOLOGICALLYADVANCED CULTURE.
THEY'RE PROBABLY ON THE CUTTINGEDGE OF WHATEVER, ONLINE DATING
OR  APPS.
AND YOU GET THERE AND YOU I READALL THESE ARTICLES AND THERE'S,
LIKE, A CRISE THERE AND WAS ITAN INSTAIN INSANE STATISTIC LIKE
46% OF WOMEN BETWEEN 16 AND 24DESPISE SEXUAL CONTACT.
AND 25% OF THE GUYS IN THAT SAMEAGE DESPISE-- DESPISE, LIKE,
THAT IS AN AGGRESSIVE WORD.
THAT'S-- THAT'S LIKE YOU SEEBREASTS AND IT'S LIKE, "GET IT
AWAY!"
>> Jon:  WHY DO YOU THINKTHAT IS?
>> THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS BUTIT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS WEIRD
GENDER DYNAMICS IN JAPAN AND WETALKED TO THIS WOMAN WHO DOES A
LOT OF STUDIES THERE ABOUT THEWHOLE SITUATION THERE, AND THEY
DON'T REALLY KNOW.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG WORRYAND THE GOVERNMENT IS, LIKE,
INVESTING MONEY IN TRYING TO GETPEOPLE TO KIND OF START DATING
AND SOCIALIZING MORE BECAUSEPEOPLE ARE KIND OF CHECKING OUT.
I ASKED THEM, WHAT, ABOUT ONLINEDATING?
THAT COULD BE A THING.
ONE ISSUE IS THE IDEA OF AHERBIVORE MAN THERE.
IT'S A SHY GUY NOT AS INTERESTEDIN WOMEN, MORE INTERESTED IN
OTHER THINGS.
AND THAT WILL BE PERFECT LIKE ANONLINE DATING THING.
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "NO IT,DOESN'T WORK HERE AS WELL
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, FOR ONLINEDATING YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE
PROFILE AND PUT PHOTOS UP AND INTHEIR CULTURE TAKING PHOTOS OF
YOURSELF IS KIND OFNARCISSISTIC.
LIKE WHAT KIND OF PHOTOS ARE PUTUP THEN?
GUYS WILL PUT UP A PHOTO OFTHEIR RICE COOKER.
( LAUGHTER )
FOR REAL!
LIKE, A RICE COOKER.
YOU GO TO A WOMAN AND GO, "IHAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE RICE --
VERY WELL."
>> Jon: DID YOU FIND IN THETECHNOLOGICAL AGE, PEOPLE HAVE
BECOME MORE DISTANT THEN FROMEACH OTHER?
HAS THIS-- IS THIS A HELP TOINTIMACY OR IS THIS A COMPLETE
HINDRANCE?
>> IT REALLY DEPENDS ON I THINKHOW YOU LOOK AT IT AT -- ONE
THING IS, LIKE, ONLINE DATING WETALKED TO SO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT
THAT AND THE PEOPLE HAPPIESTWERE THE ONES WHO SPENT LESS
TIME IN FRONT OF THEIR SCREENSAND MORE TIME ACTUALLY MEETING
PEOPLE AND NOT, LIKE JUSTSITTING IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER
SORTING THROUGH PROFILES TRYINGTO CRAFT THE PERFECT MESSAGE AND
SENDING MESSAGES BACK AND FORTH.
>> Jon:  PEOPLE GETOBSESSIVE ABOUT THAT IN THE WAY
THEY MIGHT OBSESS ABOUT THEIRAPPEARANCE.
I COULD SEE THAT.
>> AT THE SAME, THERE'S SO MANYPEOPLE FINDING AMAZING PEOPLE
THAT THEY GET MARRIED TO.
THAT WAS SOMETHING I DIDN'T --
>> Jon: WHERE DID YOU MEET YOURGIRLFRIEND?
>> WE MET THROUGH FRIENDS OFFRIENDS.
>> Jon:  TINDER?
>> NO.
SHE'S GOING TO DUMP ME AFTER THEBEGINNING OF THIS SEGMENT.
>> Jon:  SHE'S COMPLETELYNOT GOING TO DUMP YOU.
SHE LOVES YOU.
YOU HAVE A RICE COOKER.
DO YOU HAVE A RICE COOKER?
>> I DO.
I HAVE TO SHOW HER A PICTURE OFIT JUST SO SHE REMEMBERS.
>> Jon:  I HAVE TO TELL YOU,IT'S AN INCREDIBLY LIKE, FUNNY
BUT THOUGHTFUL PIECE OF WORK ANDI'M REALLY IMPRESSED, AND I FEEL
LIKE YOU OUGHT TO DO MORE OFTHESE.
IT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S INTERESTING.
I FOUND MYSELF INTERESTED.
