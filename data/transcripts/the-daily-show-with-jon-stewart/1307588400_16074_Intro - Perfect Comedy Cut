>> Jon: HI, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, LARRY KING.
HE IS THE LONG TIME HOST OF
"LARRY KING, LIVE!."
[PRONOUNCED LIKE JON IS BEGGING
HIM TO STAY ALIVE]
SORRY, THAT'S "LARRY KING LIVE."
I APOLOGIZE.
ANYWAY, AS -- NO!
OH, I FORGOT, LAST NIGHT ON THE
SHOW, I HAD AN ACCIDENT.
IF YOU WERE WATCHING LAST
NIGHT'S SHOW, IN THE MIDST OF
REALLY JUST A PASSIONATE, CLEVER
BIT, JOHNNY [BLEEPED] HAD A
LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE
EQUIPMENT.
CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT REAL
QUICK?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S NOT GOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED.
SO HERE'S, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
THERE YOU GO.
I WANT TO THANK MY DOCTOR OVER
AT MT. SINAI FOR STITCHING ME
UP, AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK
THE KID WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY
WAITING FOR FACIAL
RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY, YOU KNOW
TO, LET ME JUMP THE LINE BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY I HAD A RESERVATION AT
NOBU AT 8:30.
SO IT WAS THE PERFECT COMEDY
CUT.
IT BLED ENOUGH THAT IT REALLY,
YOU COULD SEE IT, BUT
THAT I LOST MY ARM.
[LAUGHTER]
SO THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS I
GOT HOME AND I WAS EXPLAINING TO
MY SON, WHO IS SIX, GOING ON
SEVEN, WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW
I SMASHED IT AND THE GLASS BROKE
AND I CUT MY WRIST, AND HE GOES,
"WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST USE YOUR
OTHER HAND TO SHUT OFF THE
BLENDER?"
[LAUGHTER]
UH... YEAH.
[APPLAUSE]
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
