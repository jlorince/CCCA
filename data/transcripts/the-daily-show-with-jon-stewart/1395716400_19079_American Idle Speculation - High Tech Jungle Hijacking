[ LAUGHTER ]YOU KNOW WHAT FOX AND CNN THIS
IS GETTING WAY TOHEATED AND WEIRD.
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING HAVE TOCALL MOM.
>> SOMETIMES IN THE WORLD OFCABLE NEWS THERE'S A MISMATCH
BETWEEN THE DEMAND FOR NEWINFORMATION ABOUT A STORY AND
THE SUPPLY OF NEW INFORMATIONTHAT EXISTS.
OUR JOB IS NOT TO FILL THE AIRBY TELLING BEDTIME STORIES.
>> THE WE WON'T TRY TO TURN THELACK OF NEWS IN THIS VERY SAD
STORY INTO SOMETHING THAT SOUNDSLIKE NEWS WHEN IT ISN'T.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW SHERMAN ANDMR. PEABODY ARE RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AN ELOQUENT CALL TOACCOUNTABILITY.
WELL, MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVECCED THAT TO EVERYBODY IN THE
BUILDING.
>> THE PLANE WAS CLEARLYMANIPULATED WHETHER IT BE BY THE
PILOTS OR SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVECOMMANDEERED THE PILOT.
A 5000 FOOT RUNWAY COULDHAVE BEEN BUILT ALONG THISSEARCH PATH.
IT COULD HAVE EVEN LANDED AT AREMOTE STRETCH OR IN A DESERT
SOMEWHERE. I THINK IT'S A WELLFUNDED HIJACK OPERATION AND
IT'S SITTING SOMEWHEREIN THE JUNGLE.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE RICHAND EVIL ENOUGH TO FUND A HIGH
TECH JUNGLE PLANE HIJACKINGBUT TOO DUMB TO REALIZE THEY
COULD JUST BUY THEIR OWN(bleep) PLANE.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN --[LAUGHTER]
SCHULTZ IS AGAINST CROWDSOURCING THIS.
>> GET YOUR CELL PHONES OUT.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK: TONIGHT'S QUESTION DO YOU THINK
THIS PLANE WILL EVER BE FOUND?
TEXT A FOR YES AND B FOR NO.
>> Jon: BECAUSE I'M LONELY.
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IF YOUARE WRONG BECAUSE THERE ARE NO
CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT AT ALLEVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
