TURNING NOW TO THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY
ENTERED THE CONTEST WITH A
GREAT DEAL OF FANFARE AND
IMMEDIATELY SHOT TO THE TOP OF
THE FIELD.
AND THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK.
>> IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT
WAS ON THE SIDE OF AGAINST THE
SECOND AMENDMENT BEFORE HE WAS
FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
WAS IT BEFORE HE WAS BEFORE
THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS?
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, WATCHING
GOVERNOR PERRY DO THAT, YOU
REALLY DO PICTURE SORT OF A
SQUADRON OF TINY LITTLE MEN
INSIDE HIS HEAD RUNNING AROUND
FRANTICALLY TRYING TO FIND THE
RIGHT PAPER, YOU KNOW AND THEN
ONE OF THEM KNOCKS OVER THE
COFFEE ON THE CONTROL PANEL.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LIKE THIS.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN RECOVER
FROM POOR DEBATE PERFORMANCE
NOT LIKE THOSE WORDS ARE
WRITTEN IN STONE WHICH BRINGS
US TO OUR NEXT RICK PERRY
STORY.
>> A TROUBLING STORY ON THE
FRONT PAGE OF THE "WASHINGTON
POST" TODAY ABOUT RICK PERRY.
THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS.
IT INDICATES THAT FOR YEARS
HIS FAMILY HAD A HUNTING CAMP
IN WEST TEXAS AND THE NAME OF
IT WRITTEN ON A STONE WAS N-
HEAD.
OBVIOUSLY IT WASN'T JUST N-HEAD.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME FOR?
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT.
YOU SAY IT.
>> I KNOW THAT YOU WILL
REFRAIN FROM SAYING THAT WORD
SO I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT THE
WORD WAS ON THE ROCK.
THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS
CALLED NIGGER HEAD.
>> Jon: REALLY?
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT OUR
AUDIENCE WILL (BEEP) ANYTHING.
ALL RIGHT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M JUST GOING TO GO WITH THAT
WAS A SHOCK WHOOP.
THANK YOU, HERMAN CAIN.
BOY, IF YOU EVER NEED ANYBODY
TO SAY ANYTHING OFFENSIVE IN
JEWISH TERMS, CALL ME.
WAIT.
HOW DID WE JUST FIND OUT ABOUT
THIS NOW?
RICK PERRY HAS BEEN GOVERNOR
OF TEXAS FOR 11 YEARS.
HOW COME HE DIDN'T HAVE TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
FAMILY RANCH STONE BEFORE?
OH, I'M BEING TOLD HE DOES
ADDRESS IT IN HIS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
(LAUGHING) NOW THAT YOU CAN
WHOOP AT.
THIS IS CRAZY.
I'M NOT SAYING RICK PERRY WAS
GOING TO WIN... (LAUGHING) I'M
NOT SAYING RICK PERRY WAS
GOING TO WIN THE AFRICAN-
AMERICAN VOTE ANYWAY BUT PERRY
BETTER HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.
>> PERRY SAYS HIS FATHER
PAINTED OVER THE SIGN SOON
AFTER LEASING THE PROPERTY IN
1983.
>> Jon: SURELY THAT AREA MIGHT
HAVE A PAINTING COMPANY SOLELY
TASKED WITH CORRECTING THESE
