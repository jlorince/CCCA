( LAUGHTER )
LOOK, EVENTUALLY THE SPEAKSERS
DID GET TO GUNS AND HOW UPSET
THEY ARE AT THE WAY THAT THEIR
OPPONENTS ARE FIGHTING.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS FOND OF
USING EMOTION AND,
UNFORTUNATELY, DISREGARDING THE
FACTS.
>> WE HAVE LEADERS WHO PRACTICE
THE POLITICS OF EMOTION.
>> WE WILL FIGHT THEIR TACTICS
OF FEAR.
WE WILL FIGHT THEIR TACTICS OF
DARKNESS!
>> Jon:  YES!
YES!
YES!
FIGHT THEIR DARKNESS, YOU WILL!
( LAUGHTER )
YES!
FEAR LEADS TO ANGER.
ANGER LEADS TO HATE.
HATE, HATE LEADS TO HATE
( BLEEP ).
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T-- HOW THIS QUOTE ENDS, I
DO NOT KNOW.
ALL RIGHT, LUKE SKIED WALKER,
GLENN BECK, FEAR MONTHERING IS
WRONG.
YOU'RE WRITE RITE.
PLEASE MAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT
GUNS IN A RATIONAL AND CALM WAY.
>> THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YOUR MOM AND SISTER GETTING
RAPED AND THEN WALKING HOME
UNMOLESTED IS A GUN.
>> Jon:  YOU-- YOU ARE AWARE
THAT FEAR IS AN EMOTION, RIGHT?
I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THE BIG
ONES, ALONG WITH-- THERE'S THREE
OF THEM, I THINK-- GUILT, AND
FEAR AND UM, UM-- I FORGOT THE
THIRD.
( LAUGHTER )
OOPS.
( APPLAUSE )
CONTINUE, N.R.A. CONVENTION,
REASON.
>> WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA WHERE A DEAD
TERRORIST BOMB FRER CHECHNYA HAS
MORE RIGHTS THAN AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.
>> THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE
FUTURE OF FREEDOM!
>> LYING IN WAIT RIGHT NOW IS A
TERRORIST, A DERANGED SCHOOL
SHOOTER, A KIDNAPPER, A RAPIST,
AÑi MURDERER, WAITING AND PLANNING
AND PLOTTING.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
>> Jon:  YES, HE'S TALKIN'
ABOUT YOU PEOPLE!
YUP, THERE'S A TERRORIST AND
CRIMINALS WAITING AND PLOTTING,
AND BECAUSE OF THIS GUY THIEK
GET A GUN ON THE SPIRNT WITH NO
BACKGROUND CHECKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME, EVERYBODY!
BUT, OF COURSE, THESE TYPES OF
CONTRADICTIONS, THEY USE FEAR,
WE USE FEAR.
ARE NOT AN ANOMALY.
NOT A BUG IN THE N.R.A. SYSTEM
BUT A FEATURE.
AT THE HEART OF THE N.R.A.'S
MESSAGE IS DON'T LET LIBERALS
SAY IT'S A DANGEROUS WORLD AND
SCARE YOU INTO GUN CONTROL.
LET US SAY IT'S A DANGEROUS
WORLD AND SCARE YOU INTO
GUN-A-PALOH, ZZA.
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
THEIR MESSAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE.
>> THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD
GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY
WITH A GUN.
GLI DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ONLY
WAY.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT EVEN IF THAT'S RIGHT, THIS
IS A QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU
DETERMINE THE BAD GUY AND THE
GOOD GUY?ñr
THE GOOD GUY MIGHT TURN INTO A
BAD GUY AND THEN HE HAS A GUN
AND THE BAD GUY TURNS INTO A
GOOD GUY.
WHO ARE THE BAD GUYS.
>> THE FOUNDERS ALSO WARNED
ABOUT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT
WOULD TAKE THEÑi GUNS.
>> THIEW KNEW THAT HAPPENS TO
GOVERNMENTS, AND GOVERNMENTS
TURN AGAINST THEIR PEOPLE
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP.Ñi
TYRANNY THEN WOULD GO
UNDEFEATED.
>> Jon:  BY THEçó WAY,
MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE, WORST
MONOPOLY GAME YET.
SO WE GOT IT-- GOVERNMENT'S THE
BAD GUY.
GOTTA HAVE GUNS AS A BULLED WAR,
AGAINST TYRANNY.
>> BOSTON PROVES IT.
WHEN BRAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS DID THEIR JOBS IN THAT
CITY SO COURAGEOUSLY, GOOD GUYS
WITH GUNS STOPPED TERRORISTS
WITH GUNS.
>> Jon:  GOT IT.
GOVERNMENT'S THE GOOD GUY--
WAIT.
( LAUGHTER )
SO THE POLICE ARE THE GOOD GUYS,
AND WHO THEY WORK FOR?
THE GOVERNMENT.
SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE GOOD
GUYS ARE AND THE BAD GUYS ARE.
IN FACT, THESE GUYS AREN'T TOO
SURE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TYRANNY,
EITHER.
>> I'LL TELL YOU, I WAS PROUD TO
JOIN WITH MY FRIENDS SENATOR
RAND PAUL AND SENATOR MIKE LEIGH
IS WRITING A SHORT AND SIMPLE
LETTER TO HARRY REID THAT SAID
WE WILL FILIBUSTER ANY
LEGISLATION THAT UNDERMINES THE
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO KEEP
AND BEAR ARMS.
>> Jon:  OOH!
THEY DID IT.
AND THEIR FILIBUSTER WAS ABLE TO
DEFEAT THE GUN CONTROL BILL
INCLUDING THE MARCHION-TOOMEY
AMENDMENT, SUPPORTED BY 90% OF
MERICANS AND 55 OUT OF 100A
SENATORS.
HERE IS TYRANNY EARLIER, CREWS
CRUZ TALKING ABOUT A GUN RIGHTS
BILL HE THWARTED.
>> THAT BILL GOT 52 VOTES IN THE
U.S. SENATE, INCLUDING NINE
DEMOCRATS.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HARRY REID AND THE REST OF THE
DEMOCRATS FILIBUSTERED THE BILL
AND KILLED IT, DEMANDING 60
VOTES.ñr
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW IT'S THE
SAME ( BLEEP ) THING, RIGHT?
LOOK, SHEERS WHAT'S CRAZY.
WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING.
BAD GUYS NOT TO HAVE GUNS.
SOME PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF,
BELIEVE A GOOD WAY TO DO, THAT
AT LEAST TO START, IS TOO CHECK
WHO'S BUYING THEM, OR MAKE THE
GUNS SOMEWHAT TRACEABLE SO WHEN
THE BAD GUYS GET THEM WE CAN
FIGURE OUT HOW.
NOT WAIT FOR A BAD GUY TO DRAW
AND THEN DRAW FASTER.
WHICH, BY THE WAY, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT, OKAY.
WE'LL HAVE THAT DEBATE, BUT STOP
PREPPING THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS
ARE THE LAST BARRIER STANDING
BETWEEN A FREE AMERICA AND
OBAMA-SPONSORED GOVERNMENT MOM
RAPE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
