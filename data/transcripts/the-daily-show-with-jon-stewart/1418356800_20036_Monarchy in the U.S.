MICK AGAIN.
BUT FIRST!
AHHH! (BLEEP)
FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS, AMERICAHAS BEEN FORCED TO ASK ITSELF
SOME VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONSABOUT THE WAY WE FORCED OTHER
PEOPLE TO ANSWER SOME DIFFICULTQUESTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)FOR A COUNTRY THAT
PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS MORALIDENTITY, IT HAS BEEN A TIME OF
GREAT INTROSPECTION, ONE THAT IAM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE ENDS NOW,
MOTHER (BLEEP)!
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS IN TOWN,AND I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
ENGLAND CLINGS TO THISANTIQUATED RELIC OF A MORE
PRIMITIVE TIME.
BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY, THEYARE SHINY, AND THEY ARE MORE FUN
TO LOOK AT THAN THE SHAME THATLIVES INSIDE OF US ALL!
(LAUGHTER)JOIN ME, WON'T YOU?
AS WE EMBARK ON A WONDEROUSJOURNEY WE CALL...
WILL AND KATE'S FORCEDRECTAL-FEEDING FREE AMERICAN
ADVENTURE!

THEY'VE BROUGHT TO OUR CITY.

COUPLE!
THEY ONLY DO THAT FOR THESPECIAL-EST OF OCCASIONS!
LIKE CANADA DAY. AND ALICIA KEYSRECORD RELEASE AND THE
GRAND OPENING OF THE GRILLINSIDE OF THE BUILDING.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THOSE TWO?
I ASSUME THE ROYAL COUPLESPENT THEIR TIME IN NEW YORK
LIKE ANY OTHER TOURISTS.
HIT UP THE M&M STORE, THENSPEND THE REST OF THE TRIP
WATCHING RERUNS OF "FRIENDS" INYOUR HOTEL ROOM BECAUSE A
HOMELESS GUY CALLED YOU A WHITEDEVIL.
(LAUGHTER)OR, OR DID THEY KICK THINGS OFF
ANOTHER WAY?

OFFICE.
>> KATE AS YOU CAN SEE,STAYED IN NEW YORK WHERE
SHE VISITED WITH A CHILDHOODDEVELOPMENT CENTER IN HARLEM.
>> DID SOME ARTS AND CRAFTS,APPARENTLY WRAPPED SOME
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
>> Jon: YES!
BECAUSE WHAT TRIP TO AMERICA ISCOMPLETE WITHOUT A...
REINFORCEMENT OF OUR TRADITIONALGENDER ROLES. COME ON, MAN!
WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY PRESIDINGOVER AN INSTITUTION THAT SEEMS
SEVERAL CENTURIES OUT OF TOUCH,MAYBE LET THE WOMEN TALK
POLITICS AND THE GUYS CAN DOARTS AND CRAFTS WITH THE
CHILDREN. COULD THAT BESOMETHING?
BUT STILL, SEEING A REAL LIVEPRINCESS MUST HAVE BEEN
THRILLING FOR THOSE LUCKY KIDS.
THEY SAW HER AND THEY SHOUTED"PRINCESS!"
AND THEY WERE SO EXCITED.
AND THEN ONE OF THEADMINISTRATORS SAID THEY
THEY ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE THEPRINCESS FROM "FROZEN."
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT'S ADORABLE!
AND RIDICULOUS.
(LAUGHTER)I MEAN, IF SHE WERE ELSA, SHE'D
BE FOLLOWED AROUND BY SOME PALE,HAIRLESS LIVING SNOW --

WE'VE GOT TO GIF THAT OR GIFTHAT OR WHATEVER YOU GUYS CALL
ON THERE. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,FOR GET ABOUT THAT.
MEME IT. LET'S MEME IT!
YEAH, THERE YOU GO!
WHEN ANOTHER GIRL TEXTS MY BAEON DATE NIGHT -- I'M LIKE --
WHATEVER. WHATEVER THISEXPRESSION IS SHE'S MAKING IN
THE PICTURE.
OF COURSE, EVEN WITH ALL THATHARD WORK, THE ROYALS MADE TIME
FOR SOME FUN AND GAMES.

BUT PERHAPS THE MOST GENUINELYTOUCHING MOMENT OF THE ROYALS'
VISIT CAME WHEN THEY MET SOME"REAL" NEW YORKERS.
