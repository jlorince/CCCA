OF RAISED REVENUE OVER TEN
YEARS AIN'T EVEN WORTH THE
EFFORT.
I ASSUME THESE FOLKS HAVE
THE SAME WHY BOTHER ATTITUDE
TOWARDS LOW LEVEL SPENDING
CUTS.
>> A NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR
THE ARTS, FOR THE
HUMANNITIES, ALL THOSE
FRIVOLOUS THINGS THOSE
SHOULD ALL BE ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.
>> FEDERAL EMPLOYEES DON'T
PAY FOR PARKING.
>> SO THAT WOULD GET THEM
$140 MILLION.
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WASTE
YOUR TAX DOLLARS AND TRAVEL
AROUND IN A 1.1 MILLION
LUXURY LINER.
>> WHY ARE WE SPENDING $6
MILLION, $1 MILLION ON THE
FIRST LADY.
>> YOU GOT TO START
SOMEWHERE.
EVEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NPR,
A MILLION DOLLARS HERE,
THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS.
>> Jon: OH, SO WHEN YOU CUT
T IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS.
BUT WHEN YOU TAX IT, IT'S OH,
$700 BILLION.
ALL WE HAD TO DO TO RAISE
$700 BILLION IS CUT $700,000
NPRs.
IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.
BUT IF IT'S REVENUE YOU WANT,
IT DOES HAPPEN TO BE ANOTHER
PLACE INSTEAD OF THE RICH
THAT YOU CAN LOOK FOR IT.
>> WARREN BUFFETT WRITING
HOW THE RICH SHOULD PAY MORE
TAX BUT SAYING NOT A WORD
ABOUT THE HALF OF AMERICAN
HOUSEHOLDS THAT PAY NO
INCOME TAXES AT ALL.
>> IS THAT FAIR WHEN HALF
THE POPULATION PAYS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
>> 51%, THAT'S A MAJORITY OF
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS PAID NO
INCOME TAX IN 2009.
ZERO.
ZIP, IN ADDITIONA.
>> MANY OF THEM GET SO MUCH
MONEY IN TAX CREDITS THAT IT
WIPES OUT ANY SOCIAL
SECURITY TAXES OR MEDICARE
TAXES THEY'RE PAYING.
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY ON A
FREE RIDE.
>> Jon: YOU HEAR THAT, POORS!
THE FREE RIDE ESTA OVER.
SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE
WALKING TO WORK.
ASSUMING YOU HAVE A JOB.
CHANCES ARE YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE A JOB.
SO WHY ARE YOU ASKING US FOR
A RIDE.
SO-- THE SOLUTION--
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: TO OUR ECONOMIC
PROBLEM IS, THE SOLUTION TO
OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEM ISN'T
TAXING THE RICH, IT'S --.
>> BROADEN THE TAX BASE.
>> EVERYONE NEEDS TO PAY
SOMETHING.
>> BEFORE YOU START
DEMANDING ONE GROUP PAY MORE,
MAYBE GET EVERYONE TO PUT
SKIN IN THE GAME.
>> Stephen: S THAT-- .
>> Jon: THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH POOR PEOPLE.
THEY STILL HAVE SOME OF
THEIR SKIN.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE FOX IS RIGHT.
MAYBE THE BOTTOM 50% OF
AMERICANS WHILE THEY ALREADY
PAY EXCISE AND PAYROLL AND
MEDICARE TAXES DO NEED TO
PAY MORE.
I MEAN THEY CAN SPARE IT,
AFTER ALL, THEY CONTROL 2.5
PERCENT OF OUR NATION'S
WEALTH.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY
THIS IS A PRETTY EASY
CALCULATION.
THE BOTTOM 50% IT IS SIMPLE
MATH.
IN DOLLAR FIGURES THE BOTTOM
50% OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE
1.45 TRILLION DOLLARS IN
EVERY THING THEY OWN ON THIS
EARTH.
SO LET'S SEE, THEY HAVE 1.45
TRILLION DOLLARS.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE I
DON'T KNOW, HALF OF THAT.
THAT WOULD BE, LOOK AT THIS,
$700 BILLION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHY DOES THAT FIGURE SOUND
SO FAMILIAR.
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
RAISE THE TOP 2 INCOME TAX
RATES WHICH WOULD RAISE
ABOUT $700 BILLION OVER TEN
YEARS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ONLY A
TINY FRACTION OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT'S DEFICIT.
>> Jon: SO RAISING THE
INCOME TAX RATE ON THE TOP
2% OF EARNERS WITH WOULD
RAISE 700 BILLION BUT TAKING
HALF OF EVERYTHING THE
BOTTOM 50% HAVE IN THIS
COUNTRY WOULD DO THE SAME.
I SEE THE PROBLEM HERE.
WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF WHAT
THE BOTTOM 50% HAVE.
ALL OF IT.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE A
SIGNIFICANT DENT.
NOW WE'RE UP TO 1.4
TRILLION.
AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT
THE POORS, DON'T.
BECAUSE THEY'RE DEFINED BY
THE CENSUS AS A FAMILY OF
FOUR MAKING LESS THAN
$22,350 A YEAR.
FOUR, 22,350 A YEAR.
THEY'LL BE FINE.
>> POOR FAMILIES IN THE
UNITED STATES ARE NOT WHAT
THEY USED TO BE.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
ACTUAL LIVING CONDITIONS OF
THE 43 MILLION PEOPLE THAT
THE CENSUS SAYS ARE POOR YOU
SEE THAT IN FACT THEY HAVE
ALL THESE MODERN
CONVENIENCES.
>> 99% OF THEM HAVE A
REFRIGERATOR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: 99% HAVE
REFRIGERATORS.
YOU FOOD SHILLING MOTHER
[BLEEP] HOW DARE YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S WHY IT MAKES COMPLETE
SENSE!
THAT'S WHY IT MAKES COMPLETE
SENSE THAT THE WORD "POOR"
IN THAT GRAPHIC IS IN
QUOTATIONS.
THESE PEOPLE AREN'T POOR.
THEY'RE-- I'M SURE THE OTHER
1% OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T
HAVE REFRIGERATORS DON'T
HAVE THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY
DON'T HAVE FOOD BECAUSE
THEY'RE ALWAYS ORDERING ROOM
SERVICE.
THESE POOR PEOPLE ARE LIVING
LIKE THEY JUST WON A
SHOWCASE SHOWDOWN.
>> 81% HAVE A MICROWAVE.
78% HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.
63% HAVE CABLE TV.
54% HAVE CELL PHONES.
48% HAVE A COFFEE MAKER.
25% HAVE A DISHWASHER.
>> Jon: 25% HAVE A
DISHWASHER!
THOUGH TO BE FAIR AFTER A 12
HOUR SHIFT OF WASHING DISHES
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS
TO BRING YOUR WORK HOME WITH
YOU.
SO YOU SEE, THE PROBLEM WITH
INCREASING THE MARGINAL TAX
RATE ON THE RICH AND CLOSING
CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES
ISN'T THAT IT ENGAGES IN
CLASS WARFARE, IT IS THAT IT
IS FIGHTING ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE WAR.
>> IT IS ALL OUT WAR ON THE
PRODUCTIVE CLASS IN OUR
SOCIETY FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THE MOOCHER CLASS.
>> THE MAKERS AND THE
TAKERS.
THEY WANT TO TAKE IT FROM
SOMEBODY ELSE.
>> EVERYBODY IS JUMPING IN
THE WAGON, NO ONE WANTS TO
PULL.
>> PARASITES WE HAVE OUT
THERE DEPENDENT ON
GOVERNMENT.
>> THE RACCOONS, THEY'RE NOT
STUPID.
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THEY
ARE GOING TO DO THE EASY WAY
IF WE MAKE IT EASY JUST LIKE
WELFARE RECIPIENTS ALL
ACROSS AMERICA.
>> WELFARE WILL CREATE A
GENERATIONS OF UTTERLY
IRRESPONSIBLE ANIMALS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
[BLEEP] THOSE PEOPLE!
THE POOR
