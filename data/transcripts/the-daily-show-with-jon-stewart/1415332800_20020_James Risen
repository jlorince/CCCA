WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT ABEST SELLING AUTHOR
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "PAY ANYPRICE
GREED, POWER, AND ENDLESS WAR."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO OURPROGRAM, JAMES RISIN.
SIR.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE,"THIS BOOK IS CALLED PAY ANY
PRICE GREED, POWER, AND ENDLESSWAR." THE LAST TIME WAS FOR
THE BOOK "STATE OF WAR " WHICHWAS SORT OF AN EXPOSE A OF
WIRELESS WARRENTS, WIRETAPPING,THE N.S.A.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> Jon: IT WAS A POWERFUL BOOK.IT HAD A LOT OF SECRETS IN IT.
I REMEMBER LEANING OVER TO YOUAFTER THE INTERVIEW AND
GOING,"ARE YOU GOING TOGET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS?"
AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOURRESPONSE WAS?
>> I SAID NO, NO, TROUBLE ATALL.
>> Jon:  TELL ME WHAT'S BEENGOING ON THE LAST COUPLE OF
YEARS?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WELL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEENAFTER ME EVER SINCE FOR THAT
BOOK, AND THEY'RE STILLAFTER ME, IN FACT.
>> Jon:  HOW-- HOW MUCHLEGAL TROUBLE ARE YOU-- ARE YOU
ACTUALLY IN NOW, OR IS THIS ANUISANCE HARASSMENT TO CAUSE YOU
PAUSE?
>> WELL, THEY'VE BEEN DOING APRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT IF IT'S
JUST A NUISANCE BECAUSE IT'SLASTED SEVEN YEARS.
THEY HAVE SUBPOENAED ME THREE ORFOUR TIMES.
AND THERE'S A TRIAL SCHEDULED INJANUARY.
>> Jon:  A TRIAL.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ON TRIAL.
>> NO, THEY WANT ME TO TESTIFYIN THE TRIAL.
>> Jon:  OH, THAT'S RIGHT,THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
YOU TESTIFY AGAINST SOMEGENTLEMAN.
>> BUT, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S ALITTLE UNCLEAR WHERE IT IS GOING
RIGHT NOW, WHAT THE GOVERNMENTIS PLANNING TO DO.
THEY SEEM LIKE THEY'RE KIND OFCONFUSED RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO WITH ME.
>> Jon:  REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )SO WHILE YOU WERE THINKING OF
THAT, YOU WROTE ANOTHER BOOK.
>> YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )THAT WAS MY ANSWER TO THE
GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon:  THIS BOOK IS AREALLY INTERESTING EXAMINATION
OF THE CORRUPTION UNDERLYING OURWAR CONFLICTS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  AND INTELLIGENCEAPPARATUS.
>> BASICALLY WHAT I REALIZEDWAS-- REMEMBER WHEN DICK CHENEY
SAID THE GLOVES COME OFF.
WHAT THAT REALLY MEANT WAS WEWERE GETTING RID OF ALL THE
RULES THAT GOVERNED THE WAR ONTERROR, AND AT THE SAME TIME WE
GOT RID OF ALL THE RULES, WEPOURED HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS INTO THE WAR ON TERROR.
SO YOU HAD A MASSIVE ENTERPRISEWITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS WITH NO RULES, AND IT'SA LOT LIKE THE BANKING CRISIS.
WE HAVE HAD A NATIONAL SECURITYCRISIS AND NOBODY HAS NOTICED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THEBANKING CRISIS.
WITH A LOT OF UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCES.
>> Jon:  AND BOTH SEEMINGLYPURPOSEFUL.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I THINKBOTH INSTITUTIONS -- IT'S AN
INTERESTING ANALOGY BECAUSEBOTH OBFUSCATE VERY MUCH IN A
DETERMINED WAY, SO THAT YOUCAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> RIGHT. YEAH,
AND THE SECRECY THAT'S LAYEREDON TOP OF THE WAR ON TERROR HAS
MADE IT SO LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVEBEEN ABLE TO COME TO WASHINGTON,
CLAIM TO BE AN EXPERT ONCOUNTER-TERRORISM, AND GOTTEN
VERY RICH.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND THEY ALL CLAIM THAT THEYHAVE THE SILVER BULLET TO FIND
OSAMA BIN LADEN OR TO SOLVE THEWAR ON TERROR-- WHATEVER.
>> Jon:  RIGHT. AND THIS GET TOSOME OF THE WHISTLED BLOWERS,
ALSO, THE CASE OF A FELLOW NAMEDDRAKE, WHO BLEW BLEW THE WHISTLE
ON GOVERNMENT EXCESS, AND THEYNEARLY PUT THAT GUY IN JAIL FOR
35 YEARS.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
THERE WERE, LIKE, FIVE PEOPLE ATTHE N.S.A., AND AT THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE COMBINED,THAT THEY ALL THOUGHT WERE
SOURCES FOR OUR STORIES IN THE"NEW YORK TIMES" ON THE N.S.A.,
INCLUDING TOM DRAKE, AND THEYWENT AFTER ALL OF THEM.
NONE OF THEM WERE OUR SOURCES.
AND THEY TURNED THEIR LIVESUPSIDE DOWN FOR YEARS.
>> Jon:  NOW, IT BRINGS UPAN INTERESTING POINT BECAUSE
THERE ARE, I WOULD ASSUME, YOUWOULD THINK THERE ARE LINES OF
NATIONAL SECURITY THAT WE SHOULDNOT CROSS IN TERMS OF GIVING
THINGS OUT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  THE QUESTION IS WHODECIDES WHAT THOSE LINES ARE AND
WHEN THEY BRING THE FULL FORCEOF THESE AGENCIES AGAINST YOU--
FOR INSTANCE, WHY IS YOUR STORYDIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE
OTHER-- THE STORY ABOUT SPYINGON GERMANY, THE STORIES
ABOUT OTHER-- WHY YOU?
WHY DRAKE?
WHY THESE OTHER WHISTLEBLOWERS?
>> WELL YOU KNOW -- ITHINK THERE IS A VERY
ARBITRARY SYSTEMIN PLACE NOW THAT GIVES THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITYAND THE WHITE HOUSE
AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANABILITY TO RANDOMLY AND
ARBITRARILY DECIDE WHICH STORIESTHEY WANT TO GO AFTER TO
INVESTIGATE AND WHICH THEYDON'T.
AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RETRYING TO CREATE IS A PATHWAY
FOR ACCEPTABLE NATIONAL SECURITYJOURNALISM.
IF YOU GO OUTSIDE THE ACCEPTEDLIMITS OF WHAT THEY WANT PEOPLE
TO REPORT ON, YOU'LL GETPUNISHED.
IF YOU STAY IN THE ACCEPTEDLIMITS THAT THEY WANT, YOU WON'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK ISDANGEROUS TO A DEMOCRACY, WHEN
YOU HAVE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTINGTHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO
LIMIT THROUGH THE USE OF THEJUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGAL
SYSTEM.
AND WITHIN THE LEGALSYSTEM, IS IT THE SPYING
APPARATUS THAT DECIDES?
CAN THEY CALL UP AND SAY-- CANTHE C.I.A. OR THE N.S.A. CALL UP
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND SAY,"HE MADE US VERY UPSET?"
>> YES, EXACTLY, THAT'S EXACTLYWHAT HAPPENS.
THE C.I.A. OR THE DIRECTOR OFNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, OR ANY
OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCY CANFILE WHAT THEY CALL A CRIMINAL
REFERRAL.
>> Jon:  A CRIMINALREFERRAL.
>> TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTDEPARTMENT AND THAT'S WHAT GETS
THE BALL ROLLING ON A LEAKINVESTIGATION IS THE C.I.A.
>> Jon:  LET ME ASK YOU AQUESTION-- IF THE C.I.A.
PURPOSEFULLY LEAKS SOMETHING ORTHE N.S.A.-- I'M NOT SUGGESTING
THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED-- BUT ITHAPPENS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  WHO CAN THEN GOAFTER THEM?
>> NOBODY.
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE OFFICIALLEAKS AND UNOFFICIAL LEAKS.
THE OFFICIAL LEAKS, NOBODY GOESAFTER.
THE UNOFFICIAL LEAKS THAT MAKETHEM LOOK BAD OR THAT THEY DON'T
LIKE, THOSE ARE THE CASES THEYPURSUE.
>> Jon:  DO YOU TRUST THEJOURNALISTIC COMMUNITY TO FIND
THAT LINE?
>> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
I MEAN, BECAUSE WE-- AT THE SAMETIME, WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
THIS CRACKDOWN ON WHISTLEBLOWERSAND REPORTERS, JOURNALISM HAS
GONE THROUGH A DRAMATICREDUCTION AND FINANCIAL CRISIS
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND BECOMING MOREDANGEROUS FOR THOSE-- IT'S SORT
OF BEEN DEMOCRATIZED AND PEOPLEPUT THEMSELVES IN TRUE DANGERS.
>> RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH. RIGHT.YEAH. THE FREELANCERS IN SYRIA,
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT BACKEDBY ANY MAJOR ORGANIZATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS TIMEFOR JOURNALISTS.
THE INDUSTRY IS REMAKING ITSELFRIGHT NOW, AND SO THE MODELS OF
HOW YOU DO THIS KIND OFREPORTING ARE BREAKING DOWN.
>> Jon:  IT'S-- IT'S REALLYA FASCINATING AND SLIGHTLY
FRIGHTENING THING.
DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTETO STICK AROUND.
>> SURE.
>> Jon: WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALKABOUT IT?
"PAY THE PRICE," IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
JAMES RISIN.
