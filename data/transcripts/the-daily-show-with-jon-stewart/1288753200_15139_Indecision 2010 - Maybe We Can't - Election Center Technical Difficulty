>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
OH, MAN, NOW FOR SOME MORE
INCOMING ELECTION RESULTS.
THINGS ARE CHANGING FAST AND
FURIOUS.
IN NEW YORK THE STATE SO NICE
THEY NAMED IT NEW YORK, CARL
PALADINO'S CAMPAIGN TO NOT BE
ELECTED GOVERNOR HAS SUCCEEDED.
ANDREW CUOMO IS THE VICTOR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
PALADINO, OF COURSE, TRIED VERY
HARD NOT TO BE GOVERNOR.
HE MUST BE FEELING VERY PLEASED
TONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
AND ANOTHER PIECE OF GOOD NEWS
ON A NIGHT THAT HAS NOT BEEN
MUCH GOOD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS, IN
WEST VIRGINIA, JOE MANCHIN, A
VERY POPULAR GOVERNOR, WAS
THERE, AND HE HAS DEFEATED JOHN
RAESE.
HE HAD BEEN PROJECTED TO WIN, AS
WELL, SO WEST VIRGINIA ALSO WILL
KEEP A DEMOCRATIC SEAT.
ONCE AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE THE
HOUSE OF...
( APPLAUSE )
BOY, THAT SOUNDED ENTHUSIASTIC.
ONCE AGAIN, UH, WHY DON'T WE
JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE
ANALYSIS SINCE THAT'S REALLY
WHAT TONIGHT IS ABOUT.
CHECK IN ONCE AGAIN WITH OUR OWN
JOHN OLIVER, JOHN, WHAT'S
HAPPENING THERE...
>> ACTUALLY, JOHN, I'M NOT QUITE
READY YET.
I'M HAVING A LITTLE TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTY HERE.
JUST...
>> Jon: I SEE THAT.
>> OH, BOY.
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO HERE,
JON?
YOU WANT ME TO SEND THE ERROR
REPORT?
>> Jon: DON'T SEND THE ERROR
REPORT.
>> DON'T WORRY.
I'LL JUST REBOOT.
>> Jon: REBOOT.
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT.
>> THERE, I'M REBOOTING.
SO HOW'S THE LIVE SHOW GOING,
JON?
>> IT WAS GOING PRETTY WELL.
>> HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.
RESULTS COMING, JON.
IT'S A SCREEN SAVER.
FORGET IT.
I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE
MYSELF TO THE GENIUS BAR.
>> Jon: INTERESTING HOW HE HAD
McINTOSH SPINNING BALL BUT
THEN ALSO A MICROSOFT REBOOT
SOUND.
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF INTERESTING
TECHNOLOGY WE'RE WORKING WITH
TONIGHT.
SPREAD AROUND MANY DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES... COMPANIES.
LET'S GO TO... THIS IS ONE OF
THE STRANGER RESULTS.
I DID NOT THINK THIS WOULD
HAPPEN.
IN WISCONSIN RUSS FEINGOLD, A
LEADING PROGRESSIVE VOICE IN
CONGRESS, HAS BEEN DEFEATED BY
RON JOHNSON.
[CROWD BOOING]
>> Jon: NOW THE CROWD HAS
TURNED ON US.
YET RUSS FEINGOLD DEFEATED FOR
PROGRESSIVE VALUES.
IN LOUISIANA DAVID VITTER HAS
ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED HIS
CHALLENGER BY GOING OUT WITH
HOOKERS.
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
SO REALLY, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE
WE'RE SENDING TO AMERICA
TONIGHT?
IT IS BETTER TO GO SEE
PROSTITUTES THAN, IN FACT,
BELIEVE SOCIAL SECURITY IS A
RIGHT.
LET'S CONTINUE WITH OUR...
>> JON, I'M READY.
I'M READY TO GO, JON.
LOCK AND LOAD.
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER BACK FOR
ANALYSIS OF TONIGHT'S RESULTS.
GIVE ME AN ANALYSIS, JOHN, OF
WHAT WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT.
>> ANALYSIS COMING FAST AND
HARD.
NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT MY LEFT LEG,
JON, THAT REPRESENTS THE TOLDING
NUMBER OF SEATS HELD BY THE
REPUBLICANS.
>> Jon: I SEE, I SEE.
>> FOR THEM TO TAKE CONTROL OF
THE HOUSE, THEY'LL NEED TO REACH
JUST BELOW MY LEFT TESTICLE.
MEANWHILE, MY RIGHT LEG THERE --
OUCH -- REPRESENTS THE
DEMOCRATS, AND FRANKLY THEY'LL
BE HAPPY IF THEY CAN JUST KEEP A
KNEE'S WORTH OF POWER AFTER
TONIGHT.
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE
DEMOGRAPHICS.
MY LEFT ARM, JON, HERE, SHOWS
THAT AMONGST VOTERS 35 TO 49รงรณ
SERIOUS RESERVATIONS EXIST AS TO
WHETHER THE TEA TWO PARTIES CAN WORK
TOGETHER, BUT IN THE 18 TO 24
DEMO, THEY'RE FEELING THE LOVE.
>> Jon: THAT'S A BIG GAP.
WHAT ABOUT 24 TO 35?
IS THE DATA IN ON ANYTHING ON
THAT?
>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
BUT I'M PRETTY MUCH OUT OF LIMBS
NOW, AREN'T I?
>> Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE YOU
SPENT ALL YOUR TIME LEARNING TO
USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND YOU
SPEND NO TIME ANALYZING DATA.
THIS HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN HELP YOU.
>> DON'T CROSS THE LASER ZONE.
DON'T TOUCH ME, DON'T TOUCH ME.
OH, NO, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
JON!
LOOK AT THIS.
OUCH, OUCH, LOOK AT THAT.
YOU'VE SHORTED THE ENTIRE
SYSTEM!
>> Jon: SORRY.
TERRIBLY SORRY.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
AND DON'T
>> Jon: I'M NOT HELPFUL.
>> NO ONE WILL GET ANY RESULTS.
YOU MUST FEEL PRETTY STUPID
STANDING THERE LOOKING LIKE AN
IDIOT LIVE ON ELECTION NIGHT IN
FRONT OF THE WHOLE OF AMERICA.
WHAT A FOOL.
>> Jon: WELL,
