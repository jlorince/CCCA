>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JONSTEWART.
WE GOT A PROGRAM FOR YOUTONIGHT.
THIS IS-- THIS IS EXCITING,ANNA KENDRICK, OH SHE'S ONE
OF OUR FAVORITES, SHE IS SOGOOD. "INTO THE WOODS",
SHE IS GOING TO BE HERE, VERYTALENTED.
BUT FIRST, YOU MAY HAVE BEENNOTICING THE
JUSTICE SYSTEM'S RECENTCONSISTENT FAILURE TO INDICT
POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVEKILLED UNARMED BLACK MEN
HAS SPARKED PROTESTS ALLOVER THE COUNTRY.
THE DEMONSTRATIONS HAVEBEEN OVERWHELMINGLY
PEACEFUL.
WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULTFOR PEOPLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT
THEM.
DIFFICULT, NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
>> WE HAVE THE RIGHT TOPROTEST, THEY GO ON THE
SIDEWALK AND MAKE NOISE ANDHOLD SIGNS AN LET PEOPLE
KNOW YOU DISAGREE.
BUT WHEN YOU BLOCK TRAFFIC,THAT'S A FORM OF VIOLENCE.
>> Jon: YES!
THANK YOU, BLOCKING TRAFFICIS A FORM OF VIOLENCE.
HOW DARE THESE MARCHERS PUTOUR STREETS IN SOME KIND
OF-- LET'S CALL IT ACHOKEHOLD OF TRAFFIC.
HOW DARE THEY!
WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TODO WITH THE STREETS BEING
BLACK, NOW, DOES IT?
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE THATCONVINCED THAT IMPEDING
MANHATTAN DRIVERS IS A FORMOF VIOLENCE, WELL, I THINK IT'S
TIME TO INDICT THE NEW YORKMARATHON.
THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAYPARADE, THE PUERTO RICAN DAY
PARADE, THE GAY PRIDE PARADE,THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE,
THE HALLOWEEN PARADE, THE GERMANAMERICAN STEUBEN PARADE OR ANY
RANDOM POP-UP STREET FAIRSELLING MYSTERY MEATS AND
TUBE SOCKS, AND I HAVEN'TEVEN GOTTEN TO THE MOST
VIOLENT OF OFFENDERS.
PLEASE, THAT TREE IS LIKE AGLITTERING BERLIN WALL
PREVENTING ANY MOVEMENT FROMEAST TO WEST.
MR. CLAUS, TEAR DOWN THATTREE.
(APPLAUSE)BUT IT'S ONE THING FOR
PROTESTORS, IT'S ONE THINGFOR PROTESTORS TO DO
VIOLENCE TO OUR CITY STREETSAND TRAFFIC.
IT IS QUITE ANOTHER FOR THEMTO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE
AGAINST CHRISTMAS ITSELF.
>> IT IS CREATING HAVOC.
AND WE'VE GOT TWO WEEKS BEFORECHRISTMAS.
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOINGTO HAVE SOME IMPACT-- I MEAN
WHO WANTS TO GO SHOPPING ATMACY'S WHEN THIS IS GOING ON.
>> Jon: PROTESTORS PREVENTINGPEOPLE FROM SHOPPING AT MACY'S.
I HOPE THESE SHOPPERS SHALLOVERCOME.
NOW THAT'S-- YES, I CAN'TBUY-- YES, YES, BLACK FRIDAY
MATTERS.
IT DOES.
THE PROTESTS HAVE EVENSPILLED OVER INTO
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS.
>> ATHLETES DONNING T-SHIRTSEXPRESSING A DESIRE FOR
JUSTICE.
NOW LAST TIME I CHECKED,T-SHIRTS DON'T BLOCK
TRAFFIC.
THEY DON'T PREVENT FROM YOUSHOPPING AT MACY'S.
THEY SHOULD BE A PERFECTLYACCEPTABLE WAY TO EXPRESS
ONE'S FEELINGS ABOUTPOLITICAL ISSUES.
>> I WONDERED TO MYSELF,WHAT IF LEBRON JAMES INSTEAD
HAD A SHIRT BE A BETTERFATHER TO YOUR DAD.
I MEAN BE A BETTER FATHER TOYOUR SON.
RAISE YOUR CHILDREN.
THOSE DIFFICULT ISSUES ARENOT BEING DEALT WITH BY THE
BLACK COMMUNITY.
>> Jon: WELL, BE A BETTERFATHER.
LEBRON ACTUALLY LIVES THATMESSAGE.
AND IF HE WANTS ADVICE ONSHIRTS I'M SURE HE WILL ASK
SOMEONE WHO WEARS ONE.
BUT POINT TAKEN.
POINT TAKEN-- NO, NOW-- WEHAVE TO RESPECT THE POINT.
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ONE OFTHESE TWO MEN HAS FIVE KIDS
IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS BYMULTIPLE BABY MOMMAS.
AND THE OTHER IS LEBRONJAMES.
BUT OBVIOUSLY, GERALDO ISN'TTHE ONLY ONE UPSET ABOUT
THE T-SHIRT PROTESTS.
>> THE CLEVELAND POLICEUNION DEMANDS AN APOLOGY
FROM THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.
ONE OF THE BROWNS PLAYERSANDREW HAWKINS WALKED ONTO
THE FIELD ON SUNDAY WEARINGTHIS T-SHIRT.
IT CALLED FOR JUSTICE FORTAMIR RICE.
THE POLICE UNION SAYS THETEAM SHOULD STICK TO WHAT IT
KNOWS BEST AND THAT WOULD BEFOOTBALL.
>> Jon: WAIT.
STICK TO WHAT THEYKNOW BEST FOOTBALL?
WE'RE TALKINGABOUT THE CLEVELAND BROWNS,
RIGHT?
I MEAN-- (LAUGHTER)
RANDOM CHEAP SHOT AT THECLEVELAND BROWNS.
LOOK, IT'S NOT AS IF THEREISN'T A CONVERSATION
WARRANTED ABOUT THECLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT
BY T-SHIRT OR OTHERWISE.
>> CLEVELAND'S POLICE FORCEHAS BEEN UNDER FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION SINCE 2013.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTEXAMINED OVER 600 CASES
>> THE CLEVELANDDIVISION OF PUBLIC POLICE
ENGAGES IN A PATTERN ANDPRACTICE OF USING EXCESSIVE
FORCE.
>> Jon: WELL, I GUESS THEONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHEN
FOOTBALL PLAYERS USEEXCESSIVE FORCE, THEY GET
PENALIZED.
AND IF THAT-- 15 YARDS, AM IWRONG?
(LAUGHTER)AND IF THAT FOOTBALL
PLAYER DISRESPECTED THEOFFICER WHO SHOT AND KILLED
TAMIR RICE, A 12-YEAR-OLDHOLD A BB GUN WITHIN 2
SECONDS OF ROLLING UP ON HIM,YOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT THIS
OFFICER'S FORMEREMPLOYER SAID ABOUT HIM.
>> AT HIS PREVIOUS JOB THEINDEPENDENCE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
OFFICER LOEHMANN'S PERSONNEL
RECORDS SHOW HE WAS IN THEPROCESS OF BEING FIRED.
HIS SUPERVISOR DESCRIBING ANEMOTIONAL MELTDOWN.
>> ADDING THAT HE WOULD NOTBE ABLE TO SUBSTANTIALLY
COPE OR MAKE GOOD DECISIONSDURING OR RESULTING FROM ANY
OTHER STRESSFUL SITUATION.
>> BUT THE CLEVELAND POLICENEVER ASKED TO SEE LOEHMANN'S
PERSONNEL RECORDS.
>> Jon: EVEN WITHOUT READINGHIS RECORD, THEY SHOULD HAVE
REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONGWHEN THEY MET HIM.
>> THESE BABIES CAN GO OFF.
>> Jon: SO WHY SHOULDN'T-- WHYSHOULDN'T THE CLEVELAND
BROWNS OR ANY OTHERCLEVELAND CITIZEN TALK ABOUT
A HUGE AND ULTIMATELY FATALDEPARTMENTAL SCREW UP?
>> THE CLEVELAND POLICEUNION HEADS ARGUED ATHLETES
HAD NO BUSINESS WEIGHING INAT ALL SAYING QUOTE IT IS
PRETTY PATHETIC WHEN ATHLETESTHINK THEY KNOW THE LAW.
>> Jon: I GET WHERE YOU'RECOMING FROM.
DUMB OLD FOOTBALL PLAYER.
I CATCH A BALL WHILE WEARINGA SHELL ON MY HEAD!
I MEAN SERIOUSLY.
WHAT MAKES THIS GUY THINKHE'S GOT AN OPINION WORTH
SHARING ON THIS COMPLICATEDISSUE?
AND THAT HE, THE FOOTBALLPLAYER, SHOULDN'T APOLOGIZE.
>> MY MOMMA'S TAUGHT ME MYENTIRE LIFE TO RESPECT LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
I HAVE FAMILY, CLOSE FRIENDSWHO ARE INCREDIBLE POLICE
OFFICERS.
AND I TELL THEM ALL THE TIMEHOW THEY ARE MUCH BRAVER
THAN ME FOR IT. UNFORTUNATELY,MY MOM ALSO TAUGHT ME THAT
JUST AS THERE ARE GOODPOLICE OFFICERS, THERE ARE
SOME NOT SO GOOD POLICEOFFICERS THAT WOULD ASSUME
THE WORST OF ME WITHOUTKNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT ME,
FOR REASONS I CAN'T CONTROL.
TO ME JUSTICE MEANS THAT THEINNOCENT SHOULD BE FOUND
INNOCENT.
IT MEANS THAT THOSE WHO DOWRONG SHOULD GET THEIR DUE
PUNISHMENT.
ULTIMATELY, IT MEANS FAIRTREATMENT.
SO A CALL FOR JUSTICESHOULDN'T OFFEND OR
DISRESPECT ANYBODY.
A CALL FOR JUSTICE SHOULDN'TWARRANT AN APOLOGY.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
