( APPLAUSE ) SO YOU KNOW, CHRIS CHRISTIE IS HARDLY-- CHRIS CHRISTIE IS
HARDLY THE ONLY POLITICIAN TO FIGURE OUT THAT MARIJUANA CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR CAREER.
WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE ITS VIEWS ABOUT THE WAR ON DRUGS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR--
>> MARIJUANA ADVOCATES ACCUSE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OF CRACKING DOWN MORE ON MEDICAL
MARIJUANA THAN GEORGE BUSH EVER DID.
>> RAIDS AND OTHER TACTICS HAVE FORCED AS MANY AS 200 GROWERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TO CEASE OPERATION.
>> WHICH IS INTERESTING CONSIDERING A NEW BIOGRAPHY THAT REVEALS DETAILS ABOUT OBAMA'S USE.
>> SOME OF HIS BUDDIES HAD THE CHEW GANG.
WHICH WAS BASICALLY BASKETBALL AND SMOKING DOPE.
>> OBAMA WAS A STONER?
SURELY THIS MUST OUTRAGE THOSE WHO REVERE THE AUTHOR OF THE PRESIDENCY, LIKE DORIS KERNS GOODWIN.
>> A REBELLIOUS STREAK IN A POTENTIAL PRESIDENT IS A VERY HEALTHY THING, AND ESPECIALLY
SOMETHING LIKE THE CHUME GANG,
WHICH WAS FUN AND THAT'S JUST FINE.
>> SOME HAVE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS MAY SEEM HYPOCRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT.
>> YOU'RE IN A VERY DIFFERENT POSITION ONCE YOU'RE PRESIDENT
VERSUS A TEENAGER WHO IS ENJOYING A WEED.
>> ARMED WITH HER INSIGHT I ASSEMBLED A PANEL OF YOUNG AND NOT-SO-YOUNG POTENTIAL
PRESIDENTS, ALL BOASTING A HEALTHY REBELLIOUS STREAKS BUT COULD THEY HANDLE THE DAY-TO-DAY
CHALLENGES A PRESIDENT MUST FACE.
YOU'RE MEETING WITH THE LEADER OF RUSSIA.
HOW DO YOU GET HIM TO ASSIST WITH THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'LL SWITCH THAT QUESTION.
WE'LL SKIP IT, THAT'S FINE.
EUROPE'S ECONOMY IS ON THE BRINK.
HOW DO YOU-- KEITH REALLY,
REALLY?
RIGHT NOW?
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon:  NO, IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT.
I'M ASKING YOU QUESTIONS!
>> THIS ONE.
>> YOU SAID ONE.
PUT IT DOWN.
>> HOW DO YOU AVOID A MELTDOWN OF THE EURO ZONE, KEITH?
THEIR ECONOMY IS ON THE BRINK.
>> UHM, VOMIT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, EAT YOUR CHIPS.
JUST EAT YOUR ( BLEEP ) CHIPS.
I NEEDED HELP SO I BROUGHT IN ROB CAMPIA A WASHINGTON POLITICAL EXPERT TO GROOM SOME
OF THESE POTENTIAL PRESIDENTS.
>> IT'S USEFUL TO PICK ONE ISSUE THAT OVERRIDES SOME OF THE OTHER
ISSUES THAT YOU'LL BE RUNNING ON.
FOR INSTANCE, WITH OBAMA, HEALTH CARE WAS HIS SIGNATURE ISSUE.
>> PANEL, WHAT WOULD YOUR SIGNATURE ISSUE BE?
>> I WOULD PROBABLY THROW A CONCERT ON THE US WHAT LAWN.
>> JOHN?
>> UHM...
>> ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU LIKE THIS, THERE'S THREE TYPES OF WEED.
YOU'VE GOT YOUR SOUR, YOUR.
>> SO YOUR PLATFORM IS THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WEED.
>> YES, YES, ACTUALLY.
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT STRIKES AS PRESIDENTIAL ABOUT THEM.
MORGAN HAS HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS.
RICK?
>> WHO THE ( BLEEP ) IS RICK.
>> RICK!
RICK!
RICK!
WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) ARE YOU DOING?
STOP PLAYING WITH THE CAMERA!
GET BACK TO YOUR SEAT, MAN.
LET'S FOCUS, GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN?
>> I WOULD JUST SAY WHY CAN'T WE JUST BE FRIENDS?
( LAUGHTER )
>> NO, DON'T SING.
DO NOT SING A SONG.
>> THAT WAS A GOOD SONG  ♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS
WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪ ♪
>> TONIGHT SING A SONG, GUYS  ♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪ ♪
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHY-- BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL A BUN OF STONERS!
THEY WERE HOPELESS.
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT.
YOU, THOUGH, SEEM TON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
HOW ABOUT?
>> MY PROBLEM IS I WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR THREE MONTHS
FOR GROWING MARIJUANA AND GOT TWO CONSPIRACY CHARGE BECAUSE I HAD TWO ROOMMATES LIVING WITH ME.
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.
>> I HAVE THREE FELONIES ON MY RECORD NOW.
>> HOLD ON FOR WHEREON SECOND.
ONE SECOND-- QUICK QUESTION, HAVE ANY PRESIDENTS EVER BEEN ELECTED WITH A FELONY ON THEIR RECORDS?
>> NOT THEY KNOW OF.
>> THIS GUY GOT BUSTED AND HE NOW CAN'T BE PRESIDENT.
>> WELL, IT SUCTION FOR THIS GUY.
HE GOT CAUGHT.
OBAMA DIDN'T.
>> I GOTTA BE HONEST-- IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR YOU TO BE PRESIDENT.
>> YES, I KNOW, EVEN THOUGH OBAMA AND I DID THE SAME THING AT THE SAME AGE, THE DIFFERENCE
IS THAT I ACTUALLY SPENT THREE MONTHS IN JAIL.
>> SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS
ISSUE, THE PRESIDENT'S NOT A KIND BUD.
WHERE DID YOU GO?
GUYS?
REALLY?
WHERE ARE YOU?
HELLO!
♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪ ♪
>> COME ON, GUYS!
PLEASE.
