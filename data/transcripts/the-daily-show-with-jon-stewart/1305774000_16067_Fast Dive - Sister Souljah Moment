MINT AND A PUNCH IN THE NUTS.
IT WAS NOT A GOOD DAY.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY
SAMANTHA BEE.
SAM, REPUBLICANS ARE OUTRAGED AT
HIM.
DEMOCRATS ARE SPRINKLING HIM
WITH GLITTER.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW BAD IS THIS FOR NEWT
GINGRICH?
>> WELL, JON, IT'S BAD.
IT IS REAL BAD.
ON THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
VIABILITY SCALE IT'S NOT JUST
JOHN KERRY'S I LOOK LIKE A SPERM
MOMENT, IT'S A FULL-ON HOWARD
DEAN.
>> WHOOOAHHH!
>> PACK IT IN, NEWT.
IT WAS A GOOD RUN.
>>.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU THINK HE CAN
COME BACK FROM THIS?
>> NO NEW YORK CITY, HE
CRITICIZED A FELLOW REPUBLICAN.
IF HE WANTS TO UNDO THAT KIND OF
DAMAGE HE NEEDS A SISTER SOULJA
MOMENT.
>> Jon: ISN'T THAT WHEN A
DEMOCRAT DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM
HIS BASE.
>> EVERY DEMOCRAT HAS TO HAVE
ONE LIKE WHEN OBAMA EXTENDED THE
BUSH CATS.
>> IS THIS HIS SISTER SOULJA
MOMENT.
WHEN BILL CLINTON TOOK ON THAT
RAP SINGER IN 1992 HE WAS TRYING
TO SAY I'M A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
DEMOCRAT, I'M NOT GOING TO COW
TOW TO THIS?
>> THAT'S WHAT NEWT GINGRICH
NEEDS TO GO THAT NOW.
>> Jon: THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS
DOING WITH THE RYAN STATEMENT
CRITICIZING THE EXTREMISM OF IT.
>> FOR DEMOCRATS IT'S ABOUT
DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE
LEFT.
FOR THE REPUBLICANS IT'S ABOUT
DISTANCING THEM SELF-FROM THE
LEFT.
AS FAR AS PUNDITS ARE CONCERNED
NO MATTER WHAT NOMINATION YOU
ARE SEEKING, IT'S IMPORTANT TO
DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM THE LEFT.
>> Jon: RYAN'S MEDICARE PLAN
IS UNPOPULAR.
PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT.
IN THIS CASE THE CENTER IS
AGAINST IT.
>> RIGHT, I GUESS I SEE WHERE
YOU ARE GOING WITH THIS.
IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT.

[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SAM, WHAT THE HELL WAS
THAT?
>> I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT THAT
ONE OF US WOULD DISAPPEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
SHOULD I JUST GO.
