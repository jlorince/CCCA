>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE"DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN, MAN DO WE HAVE A SHOWTONIGHT.
MY GUEST JOURNALISTJAMES RISIN.
HE'S SPILLING THE BEANS-- I HOPEHE'S ON THE SHOW TONIGHT.
THEY COULD BE DRAGGING HIM AWAYRIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
WE SAW HIM IN THE GREEN ROOM,BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT SECURITY IS
LIKE BACK THERE.
FIRST, TUESDAY NIGHT, THEDEMOCRATS GOT TAKEN OUT BACK AND
OLD-YELLLER'D BY THE AMERICANELECTORATE.
( LAUGHTER )IF YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU SHOULD
RENT IT.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD UP UNTIL THATPART.
( LAUGHTER )IT WAS A MAJOR REPUDIATION,
REPUDIATION OF THE PRESIDENTWHO, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, SPENT
ELECTION NIGHT IN HIS SWEATPANTS DROWNING HIS SORROWS IN
PINT FORCE ONE.
( LAUGHTER )THE NEXT DAY, THE PRESIDENT WENT
BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE PRESSCORPS TO CONFRONT THE WHY OF HIS
DEFEAT.
>> "I'M A SINGLE MOM AND AT THEEND OF THE MONTH IT'S REALLY
HARD FOR ME TO PAY THE BILLS."
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  THAT'S NOT WHY YOULOST.
ACTUALLY, THAT JOKE WAS BROUGHTTO YOU BY CONTEXT, CONTEXT.
LOOK AT HOW SILLY THE WORLDWOULD BE WITHOUT CONTEXT.
( LAUGHTER )ACTUALLY, THE DAMAGE-- THE
DAMAGE FROM THIS YEAR'S MIDTERMSPRETTY EASY TO CATALOG.
>> WELL, THIS MORNING, THE PARTYIS IN SHAMBLES.
>> THERE WILL BE A LOT OFSOUL-SEARCHING AS YOU CAN
IMAGINE.
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARESTILL IN SORT OF STAGE THREE OF
THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF.
>> Jon:  THE DEMOCRATICPARTY IS NO MORE.
IT HAS CEASED TO BE.
IT'S SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTALCOIL AND JOINED THE CHOIR
INVISIBLE.
SORRY, I HAVEN'T COME DOWN FROMJOHN CLEESE BEING ON THE SHOW
YESTERDAY.
WAIT A SECOND.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY INSHAMBLES.
A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING.
STAGES OF GRIEF.
WHY IS IT THOSE PHRASES ARE SOFAMILIAR?
>> THE LATEST SIGN OF AREPUBLICAN PARTY SIMPLY IN
SHAMBLES.
>> FOR MORE REPUBLICAN SOULSEARCHING IS NOW UNDER WAY IN
THE WAKE OF THE NOVEMBERELECTIONS.
>> THE REPUBLICANS ARE KIND OFGOING THROUGH THEIR FIVE STAGES
OF OF GRIEF AFTER THE ELECTION.
>> Jon:  OH, RIGHT!
OH!
I KNOW WHY THOSE PHRASES ARE SOIN MY HEAD BECAUSE THEY SAID THE
EXACT SAME ONES ABOUT THEREPUBLICAN PARTY WHEN ITS DEATH
WARRANT WAS SIGNED IN 2012.
A MERE 24 MONTHS, APPARENTLY,BEFORE IT BURST FORTH
FROM ITS GRAVE LIKE JESUSCHRIST.
OR A ZOMBIE, DEPENDING ON YOURPERSONAL BELIEFS.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S AS THOUGH EVERY EVENT THAT
HAPPENS IS VIEWED BY OUR MEDIASINGULARLY AS THOUGH IT DIDN'T
EXIST IN ANY PREVIOUS-- OH,WHAT'S THE WORD WE'RE LOOKING
FOR?
OH, RIGHT-- CONTEXT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
IT'S THE ( BLEEP ) YOU HAVE INYOUR TAPE LIBRARY THAT GIVES
SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTSPERSPECTIVE.
( LAUGHTER )REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY IS
CURRENTLY GRIEVING, THEY'REGOING TO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO
GET ALONG.
>> WE OUGHT TO SEE WHAT AREAS OFAGREEMENT THERE ARE AND SEE IF
WE CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS FORTHE COUNTRY.
>> I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BESPENDING A LOT MORE TIME WITH
THEM NOW BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLYWAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GET SOME STUFF DONE.
AND I-- I TAKE THEM AT THEIRWORD THAT THEY WANT TO PRODUCE.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY, THAT-- THAT ISINSPIRING.
TO SEE-- TWO LONG-TERM RIVALSCOME TOGETHER.
AFTER AN ELECTION AND UNITEAROUND A SHARED MESSAGE OF
DISINGENUOUS ( BLEEP ).
( LAUGHTER )BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THEIR
RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO CHANGE.
THIS WAS THEIR RELATIONSHIP LASTYEAR.
>> SOME FOLKS STILL DON'T THINKI SPEND ENOUGH TIME WITH
CONGRESS.
WHY DON'T YOU GET A DRINK WITHMITCH McCONNELL, THEY ASK.
REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )WHY DON'T YOU GET A DRINK WITH
MITCH McCONNELL.
>> Jon:  BOOM! DROP THE MIC.
WELL, THAT WAS THE OLDRELATIONSHIP.
THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP NOW.
>> ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE THATDRINK CAN MITCH McCONNELL NOW
YOU JOKED ABOUT AT THE WHITEHOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
>> YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I WOULDENJOY HAVING SOME KENTUCKY
BOURBON WITH MITCH McCONNELL.
>> Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, NOYOU WOULDN'T.
( LAUGHTER )AND SECOND OF ALL, WE ALL KNOW
SENATOR McCONNELL ISN'T ABOURBON FAN. HIS PREFERED DRINK
IS AN ALGAE AND POND WATERCOCKTAIL WITH A SOUCIANT OF
MUD AND GARNISHED WITH AREFRESHING LEAF OF LETTUCE.
NOW YOU KNOW, THERE'S ACTUALLYBEEN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROVERSY
THAT WE'VE BEEN LIKENING THEPRESUMPTIVE SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL TO ASLOW-TALKING TORTOISE MAN.
( LAUGHTER )I WANT TO-- I WANT TO STATE FOR
THE RECORD WE ARE NOT.
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS ASSERTINGTHAT MITCH McCONNELL IS
LITERALLY, BIOLOGICALLY, ATORTOISE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
SPECIFICALLY A 180-YEAR-OLDLIVING, BREATHING, GIANT
TORTOISE OF THE SPECIESALDABRACHELYS GIGANTEA
WHO HAS, DESPITE NOT BEINGINDIGENOUS TO NORTH AMERICA
SOMEHOW ASCENDED TO APROMINENT LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.
AND SO I SAY TO SENATORMcCONNELL, KUDOS.
SO WITH BOTH -- THAT WAS A LONGRIDE, WASN'T IT?
THAT WAS A LONG WALK.
YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WEWERE GOING ON THAT.
SO WITH BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA ANDSENATOR McCONNELL GIVING LIP
SERVICE TO ACTUALLY WORKING,MAYBE THERE CAN BE A TRUCE
BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTIES.
>> MITCH McCONNELL AND JOHNBOEHNER, THE SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE, THEY ARE CALLING FORANOTHER REPEAL OF OBAMACARE.
>> THE BATTLE OVER IMMIGRATIONREFORM AS PRESIDENT OBAMA VOWS
THAT HE WILL GET REFORM DONEWITH OR WITHOUT CONGRESS.
>> THE TEMPORARY TRUCE BETWEENPRESIDENT OBAMA AND CONGRESS
LASTED LESS THAN 24 HOURS.
♪ IT IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGEOF AQUARIUS ♪♪
♪ AGE OF AQUARIUS ♪( LAUGHTER )
REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT WHATMcCONNELL SAID YESTERDAY, IT
WAS CLEAR THIS PARTNERSHIP WASDOOMED FROM THE START.
>> THERE'S NO PERSONALITYPROBLEM HERE OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
I THINK MY ATTITUDE ABOUT ALLTHIS AT THIS POINT IS TRUST,
TRUST BUT VERIFY.
>> Jon:  TRUST BUT VERIFY.
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?
>> THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TREATYTRANSCENDS NUMBERS-- TRUST BUT
VERIFY.
>> Jon:  THERE YOU HAVE IT!
THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF OUR MIEWERA OF BIPARTISANSHIP IS THE
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER IMPLYINGHE IS TO OBAMA AS REAGAN WAS TO
THE LEADER OF OUR TOTALITARIANNUCLEAR ARMED NEMESIS-- A.K.A.,
THE EVIL EMPIRE.
( LAUGHTER )WELL, MY FEELING OF DESPAIR IS
BROUGHT TO ME BY HISTORICALCONTEXT.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S WHY OLD PEOPLE ARE SAD.
( LAUGHTER )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
