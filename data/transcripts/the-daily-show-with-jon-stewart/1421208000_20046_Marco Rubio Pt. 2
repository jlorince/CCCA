(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: THAT'S A SERIOUS PLACE.
WELCOME BACK!
WE'RE TALKING TO SENATOR MARCORUBIO.
ALL RIGHT, SO I WANT TO GET INTOSPECIFICS OF POLICY.
YOU INTRODUCE AN IDEA HERE THATI THINK IS A REALLY GOOD ONE.
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: ONE OF THE MOST POPULARTHINGS FOR PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN,
I THINK IT'S AN ENORMOUSHELP, YOU'RE INTRODUCING
A WAY TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM ANDTO GET THE MONEY MONTHLY
AS OPPOSED TO --
>> SO, THE EARNING CREDIT TAXCREDIT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN
CLAIM THROUGH YOUR TAX RETURN.>> Jon: YES.
>> AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWETAXES, YOU CAN GET IT BACK
DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLEYOU'RE SUPPORTING IN YOUR
FAMILY. >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND IT'S BASED, OBVIOUSLY YOUHAVE TO HAVE A JOB TO CLAIM IT.
WHAT I'M ARGUING IS THAT WESHOULD DO TWO THINGS.
ONE, WE SHOULD OPEN IT UPFOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CHILDLESS SO
SINGLE WORKERS SHOULD QUALIFYIT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND, SECOND, I THINK THAT WESHOULD DELIVER IT INSTEAD
OF ONCE A YEAR THROUGH A LUMPSUM PAYMENT THROUGH YOUR
TAX RETURN, WE SHOULD PUTIT INTO YOUR PAYCHECK.
>> Jon: A WAGE ENHANCEMENT.>> A WAGE ENHANCEMENT.
FOR PEOPLE MAKING LESS THAN$20,000, $25,000 A YEAR.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> UP TO $40,000 IN WAGE -- UP
TO A TOTAL OF $40,000 IN WAGEENHANCEMENT AND THE THEORY IS I
WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE SOMEONEWORKING AND SUBSIDIZE THAT
THROUGH THEIR EARNED INCOME TAXCREDIT.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THAN HAVE THEM COLLECTINGLONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT
BECAUSE THEN WHEN THEY TRY TO --
>> Jon: WELL I THINK THAT MOSTPEOPLE ON LONG-TERM
UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD AGREE WITHYOU. THE WOULD RATHER WORK.
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT GOES BACK TOTHE ISSUE THAT I TALKED ABOUT
IN THE BOOK WHICH IS STAGNANTWAGES. YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANTED TO FIND A JOB FOR$8 OR $9 AN HOUR TODAY, YOU
COULD BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TOPAY YOUR BILLS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WEHAVE IN THE COUNTRY THAT WE
HAVE TO CONFRONT.
>> Jon: SO, SO AND YOU ALSO THENWOULD LIKE TO RAISE THE
MINIMUM-WAGE, I WOULD IMAGINE,TO GET IT TO A PLACE WHERE --
>> YEAH, WELL THE PROBLEM --YEAH, WELL, THIS IS BETTER THAN
RAISING THE MINIMUM-WAGE, THEWAGE ENHANCEMENT.
>> Jon: WELL, LET'S DO BOTH.SINCE WE'RE, NOW THAT WE'VE
DRAWN AN AGREEMENT HERE, LET'SDO THIS EARNED INCOME TAX
CREDIT THING ANDRAISE THE MINIMUM-WAGE.
SUDDENLY, YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUSGROUP OF PEOPLE THAT RAISE
THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY,STIMULATE THE ECONOMY, I THINK
THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHINGPEOPLE CAN AGREE ON.
>> WELL, THE MINIMUM WAGE,BY THE WAY, $10.10 --
>> Jon: STILL NOT ENOUGH.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT IT'S A START.
>> $10.10 WILL NOT, WILLNOT RAISE YOU OUT OF POVERTY.
>> Jon: NO BUT WITH THE EARNEDTAX CREDIT AS WELL.
>> WELL, BUT MY POINT. RIGHT BUTMY POINT ON THE, THE CONCERN I
HAVE ABOUT THE MINIMUM-WAGEINCREASE IS THAT WE
HAVE BEEN TOLD BY BOTH THECONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE AND
INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS THAT ITWOULD COST CERTAIN JOBS.
IN ESSENCE SOME BUSINESSES WILLDECIDE, WELL YOU'VE NOW MADE OUR
EMPLOYEES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN AMACHINE SO WE'RE GOING TO
AUTOMATE. SO IN FIVE TO TENYEARS, THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN
ANYWAYS, BUT IT WILL ACCELERATETHIS PROCESS, WHEN YOU GO TO A
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IT WILL NOT BE A PERSONTAKING YOUR ORDER.
THERE WILL BE A TOUCHSCREENTHAT YOU WILL ORDER FROM
AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE WINDOW,THE ORDER WILL BE RIGHT, BUT --
YOU'VE MADE THE -- GOOD JOKE ---- BUT THE, BUT THE, BUT THE --
(AUDIENCE REACTS)(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SHUN HIM!>> BUT THE POINT IS --
>> Jon: YES.
>>  THE POINT IS, IF YOU MAKE ITMORE, IF YOU MAKE THAT
PERSON NOW MORE EXPENSIVETHAN THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY,
THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEWTECHNOLOGY SOONER.
>> Jon: THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE TOTHAT NEW TECHNOLOGY ANYWAY
BECAUSE CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.>> EVENTUALLY. THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Jon: BUT THEY'RE SOCIOPATHS.BUT THE POINT IS THIS,
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF IDEAS LIKETHAT THAT UTILIZE GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION IN CREATING THECONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS.
>> GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TOPLAY.
>> Jon: YES.
YOU BASE, YOUR CONSTITUENCY MOREON THE TEA PARTY TIP, ISN'T THAT
GOING TO BE A HARD SELL FOR YOU.
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT'STRUE. I MEAN LOOK, THE BOTTOM
LINE IS THAT WE'RE, YOU KNOW,WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
ANARCHY HERE.
THERE'S A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TOPLAY.
IT'S NOT THE PRIMARY ROLE INECONOMIC LIFE.
THE PRIMARY ROLE RELIES ON THEPRIVATE SECTOR.
YOUR SPONSORS ON THIS PROGRAMARE PRIVATE SECTOR SPONSORS.
>> Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULDDISAGREE WITH THAT.
I'M JUST SAYING THE RHETORICFROM THE TEA PARTY SEEMS
SOMEWHAT RESISTANT TO EVEN THEEARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
EXPANSION.>> I DON'T. NO, I THINK THAT --
>> Jon WHERE'S THAT MONEYGOING TO COME FROM?
>> I THINK THAT PEOPLE THAT FINDTHEMSELVES IN THE TEA PARTY
ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THEGROWTH OF GOVERNMENT
AND ITS UNRESPONSIVENESS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT GOVERNMENT HAS GROWN TOOBIG, TOO LARGE, AND TOO
EXPENSIVE. IT SPENDS MONEY ITDOESN'T HAVE, IT GROWS THE DEBT,
IT HAS A TAX RATE THAT'S MADE USUNCOMPETITIVE --
>> Jon: BUT WHAT'S THE EARNEDINCOME TAX CREDIT IF YOU,
IF YOU SUPER CHARGE THAT THATCOSTS MONEY, YEAH?
>> BUT THE EARNED INCOME TAXCREDIT, THE EARNED INCOME TAX
CREDIT IS A TARGETED PROGRAMTHAT ALREADY EXISTS.
I KNOW OF NO ONE THAT ISCALLING FOR ITS REPEAL.
>> Jon: NO, I'M SAYING IF YOUEXAPAND IT.
>> WHAT I DO KNOW IS PEOPLE ARECALLING -- WELL, IT'S NOT, WE'RE
NOT, IT'S NOT JUST AN EXPANSION.WE'RE TRANSFORMING IT INTO A
PROGRAM THAT NOW WILL BEDELIVERED THROUGH THE PAYCHECK.
>> Jon: AW, LOOK AT YOU, LOOK ATYOU TRAPPED BETWEEN TWO WORLDS.
>> WHAT TWO WORLDS?>> Jon: LOOK AT YOU.
>> IT'S THE SAME WORLD.
>> Jon: THE WORLD OF BEINGACTIVE IN GOVERNMENT AND
PROTECTING -- YOU KNOW, THERE ISAN UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION THAT
PEOPLE WANT SERVICES, THEY WANTEVERYTHING DELIVERED, THEY WANT
THE MONEY BUT DON'T WANT TO PAYFOR IT.
THAT'S ALWAYS, TO ME, BEEN THEDISCONNECT FOR THE TEA PARTY.
I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENTINVOLVED, YOU KNOW,
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY SOCIALSECURITY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT KIND OFTHING WHERE YOU'RE LIKE --
>> BUT THE, WELL, LOOK,  I DON'TKNOW.
ARE THERE INDIVIDUALS OUTTHERE THAT MAKE ARGUMENTS
THAT GO TOO FAR ONE DIRECTION ONTHE LEFT OR THE RIGHT?
>> Jon: INDIVIDUALS!
YOU WORK WITH THEM IN THESENATE!
(APPLAUSE)BUT FOR YOU TO BECOME PRESIDENT
AREN'T YOU GOING TO HAVE TO MOVETO THE RIGHT?
AND ISN'T THIS NOT NECESSARILY-- THIS BOOK
DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS THAT.
>>THIS IS, I BELIEVE THAT THISIS TAKING LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND
FREE ENTERPRISE AND APPLYINGIT TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE
21st CENTURY.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES OFTHE 21st CENTURY.
>> Jon: NO, I AGREE.
>> WE ALREADY HAVE AN INCOME,EARNED INCOME TAX PROGRAM.
>> Jon: WELL, LIKE YOURCOMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM HERE.
>> OKAY.>> Jon: YOU WANT -- WELL, YOU
KNOW WHAT, LET'S, DO YOU WANT TOGO TO COMMERCIAL.
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES,YOU'LL EXPLAIN THE COMMUNITY
COLLEGE PROGRAM THAT YOU TALKABOUT.
>> FIVE MINUTES? SURE.
>> ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL DO THAT.>> 10 MINUTES?
>> Jon: WHERE ARE YOU GOING TOGO?
>> YEAH, WHERE AM I GOING TOGO? IT'S NEW YORK.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. "AMERICANDREAMS,"
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
