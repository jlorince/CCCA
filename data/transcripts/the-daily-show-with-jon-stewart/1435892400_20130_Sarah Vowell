NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK -- DOESMcKINLEY DESERVE AN ALASKA
MOUNTAIN?
THEN YOU'RE JUST THROWINGMOUNTAINS AROUND TO EVERYBODY.
>> I MEAN, WELL -- DO WE REALLYWANT TO TALK ABOUT McKINLEY?
I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T, RIGHT?
>> Jon: I DO WANNA TALK ABOUTLAFYETTE BECAUSE I'M FASCINATED-
>> I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUTHIM BECAUSE OF THE NEWS OVER THE
CONFEDERATE FLAG.
YOU KNOW THE CIVIL WAR, THEPEOPLE IN THE UNION AND THE
PRESIDENT AT THE TIME, A LOT OFONES ON THAT SIDE WERE
REPUBLICANS.
>> Jon: YES.
>> AND THEN A LOT OF PEOPLETHESE DAYS WHO WANT TO KEEP THE
CONFEDERATE FLAG ON THEIR STUPIDSTATE LAWNS, SOME OF THEM ARE
REPUBLICANS.
YOU SAY WHAT HAPPENED?
IT WAS PRESIDENT McKINLEY, HEHAD A GUY LIKE MARK HANNA --
>> Jon: THE ANIMATER?
>> HE'S LIKE HIS KARL ROVE.
HE HAS A NICE TOMB IN CLEVELAND,IF YOU'RE IN TOWN.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> AND HE DECIDED, IT WAS IN THE1890s, AND HE DECIDED THERE ARE
ALL THESE WHITE GUYS DOWN SOUTHWHO CAN VOTE, WE SHOULD GET THEM
TO VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICANS.
AND SO HE  SENT McKINLEY DOWNSOUTH AND McKINLEY GAVE SPEECHES
ABOUT HOW --  McKINLEY, A CIVILWAR VETERAN, GAVE SPEECHES
ABOUT HOW THE CIVIL WAR WASABOUT AMERICAN VALOR.
AND THAT'S HOW THEY STARTED --
>> Jon: THAT'S THE SOUTHERNSTRATEDY.
>> THAT'S WHY THEY STARTEDCOURTING --
>> Jon: WHY DIDN'T THAT TAKEHOLD UNTIL GEORGE WALLACE AND
THE DIXIECRATS?
>> WELL, IT TOOK A WHILEBECAUSE THE GUY STILL REMEMBERED
BEING SHOT AT.
>> Jon: SO THEY STILL DON'TTRUST THE DEMOCRATS, THEY WERE
SHOOTING AT US.
>> IT WAS A LONG PROCESS, BUT IFEEL THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN THE
END.
>> Jon: THEY SOMEWHAT WERE.
LET'S GO BACK FURTHER NOW TO THEBEGINNING OF THIS GRAND
EXPERIEMENT AND LAFAYETTE.
>> LET'S RUIN EVERYONE'S FOURTHOF JULY.
>> Jon: LET'S NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S ENLIGHTEN THE WORLD FROMYOUR PERSPECTIVE WHY LAFAYETTE,
WHAT IS SO VALUABLE ABOUT HIMAND HOW DID A CHILD -- HE WAS A
CHILD.
>> HE WAS 19.
>> Jon: A CHILD!
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WHEN HE CAME TOBASICALLY DEFEND AMERICA.
WHY DID HE DO THAT?
>> ONE REASON, THE BRITISH HADKILLED HIS DAD IN A WAR, SO HE
HAD A GRUDGE...
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THIS SEEMS TO BE A THEMETHROUGHOUT HISTORY.
>> HE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROMHIS INLAWS --
(LAUGHTER)
AND HE BELIEVED INENLIGHTENMENT IDEALS OF
FREEDOM AND LIBERTY.
>> Jon: SO DID LAFAYETTE THENHAVE TO CONVINCE THE KING OF
FRANCE, WHY DON'T WE GETINVOLVED IN THIS, WHICH COULD
EXPOSE IT INTO A GLOBAL WAR?
>> RIGHT.
HE WAS IN ON IT.
THERE WERE SOME MINISTERSWORKING FOR THE KING OF FRANCE.
THE PRIME MINISTER VERGIN WASON OUR SIDE --
>> Jon: SURE, VERGIN, WHO WASTREMENDOUS.
>> I THINK OF YOU AS MY VERGIN.
>> Jon: I WAS GONNA SAY, YOUTINK OF ME AS YOUR PRIME
MINISTER OF VERGIN --
WHO ULTIMATELY ENDEDUP GETTING THE KING KILLED.
>> I MEAN, WELL --
BECAUSE HE SPENT HIS MONEYHELPING US, THEN THEY WENT
BANKRUPT AND THE PEASANTS WENT,LIKE, I'M HUNGRY!
(LAUGHTER)
THE FOUNDING FATHERS HADA PROBLEM WITH TAXATION WITHOUT
REPRESENTATION, IN GENERAL,BUT THEY WERE PRETTY OPEN MINDED
ABOUT THE FRENCH KING TAXINGTHE FRENCH PEOPLE --
>> Jon: WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT IS AN IRONY INEVER PICKED UP ON BUT YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY --
>> SOMEBODY SHOULD WRITE ABOOK ABOUT IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I HOPE THEY DO SOON!
VERY SOON!
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO LAFAYETTE COMESHERE, HE WANTS GLORY.
WITHOUT LAFAYETTE, IN TRUTH, YOUHAVE TO BE HONEST HERE, WITHOUT
LAFAYETTE, THERE IS NO UNITEDSTATES OF AMERICA.
WE DON'T DEFEAT THE BRITISH.
>> WELL, HE'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.
HE'S THINKING, I'M GOING TO GOHELP THESE POOR PEOPLE WHO
BELEIVE IN LIBERTY.
AND YOU KNOW, SOME OF THEMWATNED TO STAY IN GREAT
BRITTAIN, AND SOME OF THEMWANTED TO FIRE GEORGE
WATSHINGTON.
WE WERE ALWAYS A BUNCH OFBICKERERS.
>> Jon: SOYOU'RE NOT SUPRISED BYTHE TENOR IN THE COUNTRY NOW
AND THE ARGUMENTS IN THECOUNTRY -- YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED
AND  THIS HAS BEEN PART OF OURDNA FROM THE GET-GO.
>> FOR SURE AND IT'S OURSTRENGTH AND OUR WEAKNESS.
>> WELL, THERE IS THIS MOMENTWHERE THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS,
ONE GUY SAID, WE SHOULD HAVEA FAST DAY TO -- THEY DON'T EAT
TO HUMBLE THEMSELVES BEFORETHEIR GOD.
>> Jon: YEAH, JEWS DO THAT.
>> AND JEFFERSON WAS, LIKE, YOUKNOW THAT SEEMS A LITTLE
RELIGIOUS...
(LAUGHTER)
AND THEN JOHN ADAMS STANDS UPAND HE'S LIKE, "JEFFERSON!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A MAN OFPIETY AND VIRTUE!
AND NOW THIS!"
AND RIGHT AT THE MOMENT, ADAMSIS, LIKE, JEFFERSON IS MY
FRIEND, MAYBE I OFFENDED HIM ATTHAT MOMENT.
AND JEFFERSON GOT UP OUT OF HISCHAIR AND HE WENT OVER AND HE
JUST SAT NEXT TO HIS FRIEND JOHNADAMS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO, LIKE, WE CAN FIGHT AND WECAN DISAGREE BUT WE CAN STILL
SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
(LAUGHTER)
