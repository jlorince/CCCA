>> Jon:  HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO DO A SHOW LIKE YOU'RE DOING,
A COMEDY SHOW, WHEN THE STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY IS STILL IN QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S
DIFFICULT FOR ME, AND WE'RE PRETTY STABLE...
( LAUGHTER ) BUT I STILL GET THE PEOPLE, THEY
DON'T LIKE ME.
WHAT HAPPENS WITH YOU?
WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT, YOU AND I.
>> SOMETIMES I GET BEATEN-- NO,
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S ACTUALLY, IT'S BEEN QUITE A RIDE, AND WHAT WE DO HAS ACTUALLY-- WE BROKE GROUND IN
THE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE SAY, "WOW, HE ACTUALLY SAYS WHAT WE WANT TO
SAY." WE'RE TRYING TO BE FUNNY.
WE FAIL MOST OF THE TIME BUT WE TRY.

>> Jon:  YEAH.
IT'S NICE.
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE-- YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE TV.
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE IT.
HERE'S THING THAT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO ME.
YOU ARE A VERY ACCOMPLISHED HEART SURGEON AS WELL BEFORE YOU GOT INTO THIS.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, JEWS AND MUSLIMS, THERE IS TENSION AMONGST THE CULTURES AT TIMES--
2,000 YEARS-- BUT ONE THING WE PROBABLY SHARE IS THAT GOING TO YOUR MOTHER AS A HEART SURGEON
AND SAYING, "YEAH, I THINK I'M GOING TO BE A COMEDIAN,S WITH THE WOULD BE A PROBLEM.
( LAUGHTER )
>> IT WAS A PROBLEM, UNTIL SHE SAW THE MONEY.
(  LAUGHTER  ) AND-- AND SHE SAW MY NEW BIG TV
AND LIVING ROOM, SO SHE WAS OKAY WITH THAT.
>> Jon:  SO COMDEE, A LITTLE MORE LUCRATIVE THAN THE HEART SURGERY BUSINESS.
>> A LOT.
>> Jon:  I KNEW I WAS SMART NOT TO DO THAT.
>> AND YOU DON'T GET SUED EVERY FIVE SECONDS.
>> Jon:  I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY SMART, TOO.
HOW DID THIS ALL BEGIN?
DURING THE REVOLUTION, DID YOU JUST DECIDE THIS IS THE TIME TO TRY AND EXPRESS THIS THOUGHT?
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING I'VE WANTED TO TRY FOR A WHILE?
>> THE 18 DAYS OF THE ROVE HUGHES WAS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU WOULD GO TO THE SQUARE,
WOULD SEE WHOSE HAPPENED, YOU COME BACK, YOU OPEN THE TV, AND IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD.
IT'S AMAZING.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN NOW.
IT'S LIKE ALL RUMORS ABOUT ALIENS COMING DOWN.
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE DRIVING THE REVOLUTION --
>> IS IT REALLY THIS TYPE OF CONSPIRACY STUFF?
WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN HERE, DOES GLENN BECK HAVE A SHOW IN EGYPT OR NO?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> IT'S HIS EVIL TWIN.
>> Jon:  REALLY?
THE GUY WHO IS SPREADING SORT OF CONSPIRACY STUFF?
>> HE'S A LITTLE BIT KIND OF CLONED EVERYWHERE.
>> Jon:  OH, REALLY?
>> YES, EVEN IN SPORTS PROGRAMS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE GLENN BECK DOING A SPORTS SHOW, ASK THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL GET.
THAT WAS-- SOME BLU-RAY CAME FROM THE EYES --
>> BASICALLY IT'S FREE MASON AND THE AMERICANS AND ISRAEL HAVE
GATHERED TOGETHER TO HYPNOTIZE THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE TO GO TO TAHRIR SQUARE TO COMPLAIN.
>> YES.
>> Jon:  OKAY.
>> AND IRANIANS.
ALL THESE PEOPLE, YOU CAN IMAGINE, ISRAEL, HAMAS, ISRAEL,
AND AMERICA ALL --
>> WORKING TOGETHER.
>> YES, AGAINST EGYPT.
>> Jon:  HOW, HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHAT TO EAT AT THE MEETING?
KOSHER.
GOTTA BE KOSHER.
ARE THE PEOPLE RESENTFUL THATLET POWERS THAT BE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE WHERE
WITH ALL TO STAND UP ON THEIR OWN?
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BELIEVE.
THEY-- THEY WANT TO BELIEVE,
BUT, LIKE, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MEDIA, KIND OF POUNDING ON THEM WITH ALL THESE CONSPIRACIES, YOU
WILL FIND PEOPLE THAT WILL FALL FOR THAT.
I MEAN, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE-- WHAT'S HIS NAME, KRAMER, LIKE "MAD MONEY?"
>> Jon:  YES.
>> PEOPLE STILL WATCH HIM.
THE GUY WHO BANKRUPTED THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
AND STILL PEOPLE WATCH HIS SHOW.
IT'S INSANE.
>> Jon:  IT'S HAVE INTERESTING THAT THE MEDIA IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE-- THERE'S SORT
OF AN ESTABLISHED MEDIA AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STREET AND THE TWAIN DENT MEET?
>> YES.
>> Jon:  AND YOU TRY TO OCCUPY THAT SPACE IN BETWEEN IT.
>> IT'S BEEN FUN TOW WATCH THE MEDIA BACK IN EGYPT.
WE'RE NOT VERY MUCH DIFFERENT.
>> Jon:  NO, I THINK YOU LOOK BETTER IN A SUIT BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE'RE THE SAME.
>> IT'S AN ARMANI.
>> Jon:  LOOK AT YOU!
( APPLAUSE ) VERY SHARP.
>> I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT!
HE GETS HIS FOR FREE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  GIVE IT 14 YEARS,
MY FRIEND.
IT WILL COME, IT WILL COME.
I CAN'T TELL YOU-- HERE'S THE THING, I WATCH YOUR PROGRAM.
I HAD IT TRANSLATED.
I DON'T KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT EGYPTIAN POLITICS BECAUSE,
OBVIOUSLY, AS AN AMERICAN, WE PREFER NOT TO KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT COUNTRIES WE MEDDLE IN.
BUT I DO KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMOR BUSINESS.
YOUR SHOW IS SHARP.
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD ON IT.
IT'S SMART.
IT'S WELL EXECUTED.
I JUST-- I THINK THE WORLD OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING DOWN THERE AND
I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASE SAID THAT YOU'RE HERE.
COULD YOU STICK AROUND.
WE'LL THROW A LITTLE MORE UP ON THE WEB AND HAVE A NICE TALK.
