FARCE AND FICTION...

NEED A BROADER EFFORT.
>> NEARLY 40 NATIONS HAVENOW AGREED TO JOIN THE
INTERNATIONAL COALITION.
>> EGYPT, JORDAN, LEBANONAND IRAQ, KUWAIT, BAHRAIN,
SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, THE UAEAND OMAN.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT. NOW THAT IS A WHO'S
WHO OF MOST OF US DON'T KNOWWHERE.
(LAUGHTER)IN YOUR FACE, CRITICS.
I WILL BET THIS BOLD NEWBROAD COALITION HAS SILENCED
YOU.
>> THE COALITION IS NOT AREAL COALITION.
>> THIS COALITION IS LOOKINGDICEY AT BEST.
>> ENTIRELY UNRELIABLE.
>> THE COALITION OF THEUNWILLING, THE DISABLED AND
THE SELF-INTERESTED.
>> I UNDERSTAND IT TAKESSOME TIME TO GET A COALITION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYINGWHERE'S THE URGENCY.
>> Jon: WHO THE [BLEEP]SAYS WHERE IS THE URGENCY?
YOU SAID IT!
(LAUGHTER)WE PICKED UP 30 COUNTRIES IN
THREE DAYS.
AT THAT RATE I WOULDN'T BESURPRISED IF ISIS JOINS THE
COALITION.
(LAUGHTER)OUT OF PURE PEER PRESSURE.
I MEAN WE'RE GETTING A LOTMORE REGIONAL COOPERATION
NOW, YEAH?
>> SEVERAL ARAB NATIONS HAVEOFFERED TO FLY AIR
STRIKES AGAINST ISIS.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONIS SO FAR UNWILLING TO NAME
THOSE ARAB PARTNERS.
>> Jon: OH REALLY? OUR PARTNERS,THEY DON'T WANT TO BE NAMED,
HUH? HMM, THAT'S INTERESTING.
(LAUGHTER)SO YOU'LL JOIN THE COALITION
AS LONG AS NOBODY KNOWSYOU'RE JOINING IT. ON THE DL.
JUST AS LONG AS NONE OF YOURBUDDIES FIND OUT.
IT'S LIKE OUR COALITION ISYOUR HOOKUP, THAT YOU PRETEND
NOT TO RECOGNIZE AT PARTIES BUTAS ARE YOU WALKING BEHIND US,
YOU GO I WILL SEE YOU INKURDISTAN AT 3 A.M.
WELL, GUESS WHAT, GUESS WHATMISTER,-- WE'LL TAKE IT.
ANYTHING THAT HELPS US AVOIDANOTHER MIDDLE EAST WALK OF
SHAME.
WELL, WHOEVER OUR MYSTERIOUSARAB PARTNERS ARE AT LEAST WE
HAVE A COALITION TO GO TOWAR WITH.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUWANT TO CALL IT A WAR, OR A
SUSTAINED COUNTERTERRORISMCAMPAIGN-- .
>> Jon: IT'S NOT A WAR?
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU'RE THENATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL HEAD
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A WAR WITH ALLTHE COALITIONS AND THE TALKING
TO THE NATION ON TELEVISION ANDTHE, ALL RIGHT.
HIGH RANKING OBAMA OFFICIALSAYS NOT A WAR.
>> WE ARE AT WAR WITH ISILIN THE SAME WAY WE ARE AT
WAR AND CONTINUE TO BE ATWAR WITH AL QAEDA.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: SO IT'S A WAR.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT TO ADMIT IT SOUNDSBETTER, WAR, IMAGINE IF
GEORGE LUCAS HAD CALLED HISMOVIE, STAR SUSTAINED
COUNTER-TERRORISM CAMPAIGN.WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME POP.
I GOT TO SAY, THOUGH.
THE-- IT SOUNDS LIKE-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION, SOUNDS LIKE
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ISA LITTLE CONFUSED OVER OUR
CURRENT SITUATION VIS-A-VISWHETHER IT'S A WAR OR NOT.
AND HERE'S HOW CONFUSED THEYARE.
YOU CAN GET BOTH POINTS OFVIEW FROM ONE GUY.
>> IS THE U.S. AT WAR WITHISIS?
>> WE'RE ENGAGED IN A MAJORCOUNTERTERRORISM OPERATION.
>> NOT A WAR.
>> AND IT'S GOING TO BE ALONG-TERM COUNTERTERRORISM
OPERATION.
>> WE'RE AT WAR WITH ALQAEDA AND ITS AFFILIATES AND
IN THE SAME CONTEXT, IF YOUWANT TO USE IT, YES, WE'RE
AT WAR WITH ISIL IN THATSENSE.
>> Jon: I LOVE THAT PASSIVEAGGRESSIVE TONE. HEY, MAN, IF
YOU ARE UNHUNG UP ONLABELS --
(LAUGHTER)
IF YOU NEED TO CALL ITSOMETHING, I GUESS WAR WILL
DO.
(LAUGHTER)ME, I JUST THINK WE'RE ALL
JUST PEOPLE ON THIS EARTHTRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER
BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE GET ACHANCE TO DO IT.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHY IT'SIMPORTANT, BECAUSE
THERE ARE LEGALRAMIFICATIONS TO THIS.
HOW WE DEFINE THE CONFLICTWILL INFORM WHO HAS THE
AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THETHREAT FROM ISIS-ISIL.
>> I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TOADDRESS THE THREAT FROM
ISIL.
>> I SEE, AND YOU ARE?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WOULD HAVE WORKEDBETTER WITH GLASSES,
PROBABLY.
WOULD SOMEONE CARE TOEXPLAIN WHY YOU HAVE THE
AUTHORITY?
>> THE PRESIDENT'S RELYINGON THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE
OF MILITARY FORCE
PRESIDENT BUSH HAD SIGNED IN2001 AND 2002,
TO DO THIS.
>> Jon: OH [BLEEP], 13 YEARSAGO, YOU KNOW WHAT, AIN'T NO
WAR LIKE A MIDEAST WARBECAUSE A MIDEAST WAR DON'T
STOP.
THE ROOF, THE ROOF!
THE ROOF HAS BEEN TARGETEDFOR CONFLAGRATION BY
UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES.
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOWS WHAT'S SAD AT A
BAR MITZVAH I'M CONSIDERED AGOOD DANCER.
(LAUGHTER)ISN'T THAT SAD?
ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TOGO AFTER ISIS BASED ON
PRESIDENT BUSH'S 2001AUTHORIZATION OR AUMF FOR
GOING AFTER AL QAEDA.
BUT THERE ISN'T AL QAEDA, THISIS ISIS-ISIL.
>> NOT EVERY COLLECTION OF THUGSTHAT LABELS THEMSELVES
AL QAEDA WILL POSE A CREDIBLETHREAT TO THE UNITED STATES.
SO I LOOK FORWARD TOENGAGING CONGRESS AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN EFFORTSTO REFINE AND ULTIMATELY
REPEAL THE AUMF'S MANDATE.
>> Jon: WELL, THEN YOU ARELUCKY THAT CONGRESS NEVER DOES
ANYTHING YOU ASK.
BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WOULDBE SCREWED RIGHT NOW!
(APPLAUSE)SCREWED!
BUT THIS REALLY DOES POINTOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE BUSH AND THE OBAMAADMINISTRATIONS.
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WASINCREDIBLY DISCIPLINED AND
FOCUSED WHEN THE TIME CAMETO PERSUADE THIS COUNTRY TO
DO THE WRONG THING.
WHEREAS THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE
US TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN ASCHAOTIC AND CONFUSED A WAY
AS POSSIBLE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
