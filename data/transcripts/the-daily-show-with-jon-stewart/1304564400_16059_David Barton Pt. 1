>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AMERICAN
HISTORIAN AND THE FOUNDER AND
PRESIDENT OF WALLBUILDERS, DAVID
BARTON.
SIR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
APPRECIATE IT.
SIT.
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED, SO WE HAVE MIKE
HUCKABEE ON THE SHOW.
>> RIGHT.
GOOD GUY.
>> Jon: VERY NICE GUY, GOOD
FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
WE ALWAYS HAVE REALLY
INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS.
SO I'M WATCHING HIM PRAISE YOU.
HE WAS AT A CONFERENCE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: HE SAID DAVID BARTON
IS THE GREATEST HISTORIAN IN
AMERICA AND ALL CHILDREN SHOULD
HAVE TO LEARN FROM HIM IN THEIR
CURRICULUM.
I'M PARAPHRASING.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND I THOUGHT TO
MYSELF, WELL, GEEZ, I'D LIKE THE
MEET THE GREATEST HISTORIAN IN
AMERICA.
THEN I STARTED LOOKING UP YOUR
STUFF, AND I THOUGHT, OKAY...
>> THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO
DO.
>> Jon: THIS SEEMS ODD.
SO I ASKED MIKE HUCKABEE ABOUT
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE
BEEN SAYING, AND HE SAID, WHY
DON'T YOU ASK DAVID BARTON
HIMSELF.
AND I SAID, OKAY.
AND HERE I AM.
SO HERE YOU ARE.
SO LET ME ASK YOU, JUST FOR OUR
AUDIENCE THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR
WITH WHAT YOU DORK HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS YOU DO?
>> I'D SAY HISTORICAL
RECLAMATION.
WE AND OUR COMPANY HAVE ABOUT
100,000 DOCUMENTS FROM BEFORE
1812.
SO DOCUMENTS OUT OF BLACK
HISTORY, OUT OF RELIGIOUS
HISTORY, CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY,
YOU NAME IT.
WE'VE GOT 100,000 ORIGINALS.
THAT'S WHAT WE TAKE A LOT OF
HISTORY BACK TO, THOSE ORIGINAL
THINGS THAT HAPPENED.
>> Jon: BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS
THE HISTORY YOU TAKE COMES BACK
TO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE A MORE
CHRISTIAN NATION THAN WE ARE
LIVING.
IS THAT...
>> THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO POINT THAT
OUT, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD
EXAMPLE.
IN TEXAS I WAS APPOINTED AS AN
EXPERT TO DO HISTORY IN
GOVERNMENT STANDARDS THERE.
>> Jon: SO YOU ARE A
CURRICULUM AUTHORITY?
>> FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS,
CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, ALL THESE
STATEDS, I DO THEIR HISTORY AND
SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS.
SO I'M ASKED BY THE GOUGH OR BY
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO
DO THAT.
>> AND THIS MAY BE A
MISCONCEPTION, BUT YOU DON'T...
YOU ARE NOT A HISTORIAN IN TERMS
OF ACADEMIC HISTORIAN.
YOU DON'T HAVE A DOCTORATE.
>> NO.
I'VE GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS.
THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN
BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH HISTORY
AND SCHOOL AND WHAT I GOT TAUGHT
AND WHAT I SEE IN THE ACTUAL
DOCUMENTS AREN'T THE SAME THING.
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME STARTED.
SOME REALLY OLD DOCUMENTS CONTRA
DINGTED MY SCHOOL BOOKS.
SO WE SAY PUBLISHERS, HERE'S
WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS ARE,
PRINT THE DOCUMENTS.
GO BACK TO THE ORIGINALS.
ON THE ISSUE OF RELIGION, BEING
ONE OF THE GUYS APPOINTED IN
TEXAS, ALL MY REVIEWS ARE
ONLINE.
THERE'S 43,000 WORDS ONLINE OF
MY REVIEWS OVER THE LAST SET OF
STANDARDS.
ONLY TWO SUBJECTS DO I EVER
MENTION CHRISTIANITY.
ONE WAS THE TEACHER'S
RECOMMENDED TAKING THE STUDY OF
CHRISTMAS OUT OF THE HOLIDAY.
>> YOU ARE SAYING YOU ARE NOT
INTERESTED IN...
>> OH, I AM.
I AM.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> AS AN EMPHASIS.
>> Jon: THAT'S YOUR ALMOST
TOTAL EMPHASIS.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
>> Jon: OH.
>> I KNOW THE KIND OF PEOPLE
THAT GO AFTER ME.
AND WHEN I WAS ON THE TEXAS
BOARD, THERE'S A GROUP THAT DID
A PRESS RELEASE AND ALL OF A
SUDDEN MSNBC AND THE "TIMES,"
ALL THESE GROUPS...
>> BARTON IS CRAMMING
CHRISTIANITY DOWN THEIR THROATS
IN TEXAS.
NO, THERE'S 43,000 WORDS, TWO
REFERENCES TO CHRISTIANITY.
THAT'S NOT A SUPER BIG EMPHASIS,
NOT THAT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO
ME, BUT WHAT I TEACH...
>> I WOULD SAY IN LEVITICUS,
BEING DAY IS MENTIONED TWICE,
BUT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT KIND OF
MAKE A BIG EMPHASIS OUT OF THAT.
>> THAT'S NOT A HISTORY ISSUE.
>> Jon:, NO BUT I'M SAYING I
DON'T KNOW THAT...
>> LETS ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.
>> Jon: PLEASE.
>> PUBLISHERS COME TO ME AND SAY
YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE STANDARDS.
AND I WHAWNS MY NAME EVOKES, SO
I TOLD THE PUBLISHERS, I'LL BE
THE EDITOR, BUT DON'T PUT MY
NAME IN THE NEXT BOOK.
THAT TEXTBOOK I EDITED IS THE
BESTSELLING PUBLISHED SCHOOL
TEXTBOOK MANY AMERICA.
HISTORIANS THINK IT'S A GREAT
BOOK.
THEY DON'T KNOW I DID IT.
>> Jon: WELL, NOT HISTORIANS.
>> TEACHERSEN
>> Jon: WHEN TEXAS MAKES A
BOOK, IT'S NOT A FREE MARKET
THING.
>> IT WAS BECAUSE I WORKED AT
THE PUBLISHERS, NOT THE STANDARD
IN TEXAS.
THE PUBLISHERS CAME TO ME.
>> Jon: MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING
IT, IT'S CLEARLY BETTER.
>> WELL, YEAH, EXACTLY.
BUT...
