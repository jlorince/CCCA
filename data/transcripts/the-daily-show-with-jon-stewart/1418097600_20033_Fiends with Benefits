BUT FIRST, FROM TIME TO TIMEIN THE PROGRAM I LIKE TO
CHECK IN WITH CONGRESS.
AND WHEN I SAY,OBVIOUSLY LIKE TO CHECK IN,
I MEAN FORCE OURSELVES.
WHILE GAGGING. THE, THE, YOUKNOW,
CONGRESS'S APPROVAL RATINGRECENTLY HAS SURGED FROM A
PATHETIC 10% ALL THE WAY UPTO -- YEAH, 11%.
(LAUGHTER)BASICALLY, PUTS THEM RIGHT BELOW
EXPLOSIVE CRUISE SHIPDIARRHEA AND RIGHT ABOVE
TIME WARNER CABLE.
(LAUGHTER)SO 9% APPROVAL, THEY MUST
HAVE GOTTEN BETTER.
BUT 11% IS STILL A LONG WAYFROM A PASSING GRADE.
TO REACH THAT CONGRESS IS GOINGTO HAVE TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION
THAT IS SO POPULAR, SONONPARTISAN, SO TOTALLY
UNOJECTIONABLE THAT THEWHOLE COUNTRY COULD UNITE
BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS?
>> I RISE TODAY TO URGEPASSAGE OF HR 5739, THE NO
SOCIAL SECURITY FOR NAZI'S ACT.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THAT WILL DO.
(LAUGHTER)THE NO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR
NAZIS ACT.
A BILL SO UNCONTROVERSIALCONGRESS DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO
HIDE IT.
ITS TRUE PURPOSE BEHIND ADISINGENUOUS MADE UP
NAME LIKE PATRIOT ACT, ORFREEDOM ACT, OR BALD
PATRIOTIC USA FREEDOM ACT FORFREE PATRIOTS LIBERTY BALD
EAGLE BASEBALL HAMBURGERACT.
THIS SEEMS PRETTYNONDEBATABLE.
(LAUGHTER)SO LET'S-- LET'S GO TO THE
DEBATE.
>> SOCIAL SECURITY IS ANEARNED BENEFIT THAT WAS
NEVER INTENDED FOR THOSE WHOPARTICIPATED IN HORRIFIC
ACTS OF THE HOLOCAUST.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I WOULD IMAGINE MOST
GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAMSARE NOT INTENDED TO DIRECTLY
BENEFIT THE NAZIS.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
CASH FOR KLINKERS. THANK YOU.THANK YOU.
(APPLAUSE)HOGAN!
YES, CONGRESS IS HELD IN SUCHLOW ESTEEM THAT EVEN WHILE
PASSING A BILL BANNING SOCIALSECURITY PAYMENTS TO NAZIS
SEVERAL MEMBERS FELT THE NEED TOMAKE IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR
THAT THEY THEMSELVESARE ANTI-NAZI.
>> I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TOEND THIS OUTRAGE.
>> CUT OFF BENEFITS ANYONESTRIPPED OF THEIR U.S.
CITIZENSHIP RELATED TO THEIRPARTICIPATION IN NAZI
CRIMES.
>> THEY COMMITTEDHEINOUS CRIMES.
>> MR. SPEAKER, I URGE ALLMEMBERS OF THE HOUSE TO VOTE
YES AND PASS THE NO SOCIALSECURITY TO NAZIS ACT TODAY.
>> DO YOU REALLY HAVE TOURGE PEOPLE DO THIS?
WHO ARE YOU URGINGCONGRESSMAN DENNIS
WHITEPOWER?
NOW WAIT, HOLD ON THERE,LET'S NOT RUSH INTO ANYTHING,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
BUT  BRAVO CONGRESS ON YOURCOURAGEOUS ANTI-SOCIAL
SECURITY FOR NAZIS STAND.
I CANT' BELIEVE YOUWASTED THE NATION'S TIME
MAKING YOURSELF LOOK GOOD BYPASSING A BILL TO STOP
SOMETHING THAT COULD NEVERHAPPEN IN A MILLION YEARS
ANYWAY.
>> AS OF NOW THERE IS ALOOPHOLE ALLOWING FORMER
NAZIES TO COLLECT MILLIONSOF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS.
FORMER AUSCHWITZ GUARD JAKOBDENZINGER WHO FLED THE U.S.
IN 1989 BUT STILL GETS ABOUT$1500 A MONTH WHILE LIVING
IN CROATIA.
AN ASSOCIATED PRESSINVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFEREDPAYMENTS TO NAZIS AS
INCENTIVE TO LEAVE THEUNITED STATES.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: WELL, DON'T I LOOK
STUPID.
REALLY, WE HAVE NO OTHER WAYOF MAKING NAZIS GO AWAY?
BUT TO BRIBE THEM?
SEE HERE, YOU NAZI MONSTER.
I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN TO THEENDS OF THE EARTH SO THAT I
CAN DELIVER YOU THESEMONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY
CHECKS.
WE CAN PUT THEM DIRECTLY INYOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, BUT
FIRST I HAVE TO ASK YOU, ISIT SAFE?
NOW YOU GOT THE KLINK THING,I THOUGHT THE MARATHON MAN
WOULD GO TOO. SEE IT TURNSOUT THAT AFTER WORLD WAR II
WE GRANTED CITIZENSHIPTO SEVERAL THOUSANDS LET'S CALL
THEM EUROPEAN GENTLEMENONLY TO FIND OUT LATER WHEN THEY
LISTED THEIR OLD JOBAS CAMP COUNSELOR --
BUT RATHER THANGO THROUGH THE LENGTHY AND
DIFFICULT PROCESS OFDEPORTING THEM, THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT CONVINCED THEM TOSELF-DEPORT WITH A SORT OF
CITIZENSHIP SEVERANCEPACKAGE ALTHOUGH THEY CALLED
IT SOMETHING ELSE.
>> IT BECAME KNOWN AS NAZIDUMPING.
>> NAZI DUMPING.
>> NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITHTHE BEST SELLING SCAT PORN
DVD IN GERMANY WHICH IS TOSAY THE BEST SELLING DVD IN
GERMANY.
LIKE ANY DUMP WHEN YOU FLUSHIT AWAY IT JUST WASHES UP
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
>> TROUBLE WAS, ONCE THEYFOUND THEM NOBODY WANTED
THEM.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THEBLOWBACK WHEN SOMEONE-- UNWANTED
WOULD SHOW UP IN ANOTHERCOUNTRY UNANNOUNCED.
>> YEAH, YOU THINK NAZI WASBE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT BLOW
BACK.
I'M PRETTY SURE SHOWING UPUNWANTED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY
UNANNOUNCED, KIND OF THEIRCALLING CARD.
APPARENTLY OF ALL OUR ALLIESAUSTRIA WAS PARTICULARLY
FURIOUS WHEN WE SENT THEM AFORMER CONCENTRATION CAMP
GUARD WITHOUT WARNING.
THAT'S RIGHT, AUSTRIA,COMPLAINING ABOUT ANOTHER
COUNTRY FOISTING NAZIS ON IT,AUSTRIA, THE WORLD'S NUMBER
ONE EXPORTER OF ADOLFHITLERS.
