>> Jon:  IT'S BEEN A ROUGHDAY.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON HUMANITYTHESE DAYS-- PRO OR AGIN?
WHERE DO YOU HAVE US?
>> WELL, IT IS REALLY TRAGICNEWS WHAT HAPPENED, AND I HAVE
SEEN THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONSIN MY LIFE WHEN THERE'S NO
JUSTICE, WHEN THERE'S NO HUMANFEELINGS, AND THERE'S NO
HUMANITY, AND FOR A SECOND YOUTHINK THAT NO ONE HAS FEELINGS
AT ALL.
BUT WE ARE-- OUR PRAYERS AREWITH THE FAMILIES AND WE PRAY
FOR PEACE.
WE PRAY FOR THE PROSPERITY OFEVERYONE.
>> Jon:  IT'S INTERESTINGYOU SAID SOMETHING IN THE FILM
WHICH IS "ONE VOICE."
AND THERE ARE MANY VOICES, AND ITHINK THE EASY THING TO FORGET
IS HOW EASY IT IS FOR DARKNESSTO WREAK HAVOC AND TO FORGET
WE'RE REALLY MUCH MORESURROUNDED BY LIGHT AND BY
EDUCATION.
NOW, ARE YOU STILL IN SCHOOL?
>> YES.
I HAVE JUST MY EXAMS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT.
>> Jon:  THE G.S.E.?
ARE YOU IN COLLEGE?
ARE YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL?
>> I'VE BEEN TWO YEARS TOCOLLEGE.
>> Jon:  STILL TWO YEARSUNTIL COLLEGE?
>> YES.
>> Jon:  YOU MIGHT WANT TOWORK ON YOUR RESUME, BECAUSE A
LOT OF COLLEGES NOW AREREALLY-- YOU MAY GET VERY GOOD
TEST SCORES.
I'M NOT IN ANY WAY SAYING THATYOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET GOOD
TEST SCORES, BUT YOU ALSO NEEDSOME EXTRACURRICULARS.
( LAUGHTER )
WITHIN THAT, I MEAN, THE PEACEPRIZE IS GOING TO GET YOU SO
GOOD, BUT THERE IS--
( LAUGHTER )
>> NO, I HAVE ABOUT IT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE WORKEXPERIENCE FOR A WEEK AND GET
GOOD GRADES.
I HAVE ONE MONTH EXAM AND IWORKED SO HARD.

>> ONE MONTH. 12th OF MAY TO12th OF JUNE.
>> Jon:  FOR SCHOOL?

( LAUGHTER )
WHERE THEY TAKE-- I THINKIT'S, LIKE, A HALF A DAY OF
TESTS AND THEN THEY SHOW "AQEELAAND THE BEE" THE REST OF THE
WEEK.
>> I WISH I WAS HERE.
I WISH I WAS HERE.
>> Jon:  NO.
IT'S INTERESTING, WHEN I WATCHEDTHE FILM, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT--
IN SOME WAYS, THE WORLD HAS BEENSOMEWHAT UNFAIR TO YOU, IN THAT
IT HAS PLACED A BURDEN UPON YOUTHAT I THINK IS-- THAT YOU ARE
SOMEHOW AN ETHEREAL CREATURETHAT MUST SAVE US.
AND I THINK WHAT'S NICE ABOUTTHE FILM IS TO SEE YOU AS-- YOU
SAY YOURSELF AS I'M AN ORDINARYGIRL, MAYBE REPRESENTING
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OFORDINARY GIRLS, WHOSE COURAGE IS
THE SAME IN PAKISTAN AND ALLOVER THE WORLD AS THEY JUST
STRIVE FOR AN EDUCATION.
IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?
>> I THINK I HAVE THISOPPORTUNITY TO RAISE MY VOICE,
AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOTJUST-- I'M NOT JUST REPRESENTING
MYSELF BUT I AM SPEAKING UP FORALL GIRLS WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF
EDUCATION.
THERE ARE ABOUT 66 MILLIONGIRLS, AND I THINK I'M SPEAKING
UP FOR THEM.
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO THINGSTHAT IT HAS BEEN FORCED UPON ME
OR I HAVEN'T CHOSEN THIS LIFE,BUT THE REALITY IS I HAVE CHOSEN
THIS LIFE.
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IT, ICOULD HAVE SAID NO AND WOULD
HAVE SAID I DON'T WANT TO COMEOUT AND SPEAK AGAIN.
BUT I DO FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY,AND I DO FEEL THAT IT'S MY DUTY
TO SAY WHAT'S RIGHT, AND IT'SNOT THAT-- SOMETIMES WE WAIT FOR
OTHERS AND THINKING THAT MARTINLUTHER SHOULD RAISE AMONG US,
NELSON MANDELA SHOULD RAISE UPAMONG US AND SPEAK UP FOR US,
BUT WE NEVER REALIZE THERE ARENORMAL HUMANS LIKE US, AND IF WE
STEP FORWARD WE CAN ALSO BRINGCHANGE JUST LIKE THEM.
>> Jon:  NO, IT'S INSPIRING,ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO THINK-- YOU
HAVE TWO BROTHERS.
>> YES.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU THE OLDEST?
>> YES, I AM THE OLDEST.
>> Jon:  AND I HAVE TO THINKFOR THEM TO COME HOME AND SAY,
"I GOT IN THE SCHOOL PLAY!"
( LAUGHTER )
AND THEN YOU COULD JUST BE LIKE,"IS IT ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW,
BEING AWARD A NOBEL PEACEPRIZE, THIS PLAY?"
AND YOU CAN TAUNT THEM.
AND IT'S CLEAR IN THE FILM, YOUENJOY TAUNTING THEM.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I THINK THEY SHOULD BE NICETO ME.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  YES, I THINK THAT'STRUE.
THE LITTLE ONE HAS A-- THERE'S AVERY, VERY FUNNY-- YOU TWO SEEM
TO HAVE A VERY PLAYFULRELATIONSHIP.
>> YES, AND IN THE TRAILER, IPRAISED HIM BUT I'M KIND OF
REGRETTING WHY I PRAISED HIM,BECAUSE HE IS GETTING KIND OF,
NOT A GOOD BROTHER.
>> Jon:  REALLY?
HE'S A LITTLE NAUGHTY.
THE OLDER BROTHER SEEMED TO BE--HE WAS KNOWN AS WANT LAZY ONE IN
THE CLIP.
BUT THE LITTLE ONE YOU FELT WASVERY GOOD, A LITTLE BIT NAUGHTY.
HE'S GOING FULL-BLOWN NAUGHTY?
>> YES.
>> Jon:  AND WHAT I LOVEABOUT WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU LOVE
YOUR COUNTRY.
AND YOU LOVE YOUR RELIGION, ANDYOU'RE NOT LOOKING TO-- YOU'RE
LOOKING TO JUST SPEAK FOR PEOPLEWHO WANT AN EDUCATION.
>> DEFINITELY.
I HAVE TRUE LOVE FOR MY COUNTRY,AND WHEN I GOT THE NOBEL PEACE
PRIZE, KAILASH SATYARTHI, THECO-WINNER, WEHN WE WAS GOING
BACK TO HIS COUNTRY, INDIA,WHILE WE WERE GOING BACK TO THE
U.K.
SO MY MOTHER WAS REALLY SAD, ANDSHE EVEN CRIED THAT WE DON'T
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TOOUR COUNTRY.
SO I'M HOPEFUL WE WILL GET THISCHANCE TO SEE OUR COUNTRY, TO
SEE OUR LAND, TO SEE OUR PEOPLE.
AND I THINK IT'S SUCH A PRECIOUSTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU ARE
ON YOUR LAND AND YOU ARE WITHYOUR PEOPLE, WITH YOUR
RELATIVES, WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
AND I THINK WHOEVER HAS THISOPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE THANKFUL,
AND WE HOPE TO SEE OUR LAND.
>> Jon:  THE FOOTAGE FROM SWATVA LELY IS BEAUTIFUL.
IT LOOKS LIKE A SORT OF MAGICALPLACE.
>> DO YOU STILL THINK IT'S ASBEAUTIFUL AS NEW JERSEY?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW, I HAVE TOSAY, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
PAYING ATTENTION DURING THE LASTINTERVIEW.
SO NOW, NOW I HAVE TO THINK BACKTO ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS I
SAID.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK-- IWANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE
EDUCATION WORK, ESPECIALLY, THESTUFF IN THE FILM ESPECIALLY IN
AFRICA.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK MOREWITH MALALA YOUSAFZAI, RIGHT
AFTER THIS.
