WHATEVER (BLEEP) YOU WANT TO
TALK.
FOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WE'RE
JOINED BY SENIOR ARMED FORCES
CORRESPONDENT SPAN THAT BEE.
SAM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M CONFUSED.
THE WHOLE THING HAS ME VERY
CONFUSED.
RICK SANTORUM SAYS WOMEN CAN'T
BE IN COMBAT BECAUSE THEY'LL
TRIGGER MEN'S CHIVALROUS NATURE.
RIZ TROTTA SAYS FEMALE SOLDIERS
CAN'T SERVE BECAUSE THEY'LL
AROUSE MEN'S BASER INSTINCTS.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
>> WELL, JON, I KNOW YOU'RE
EXPECTING AN APOLOGY AND,
BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL GET IT.
>> Jon: FROM... FROM YOU?
AN APOLOGY FOR WHAT, SAM?
>> JON, FOR THIS.
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU GUYS CAN RAPE IT OR YOU CAN
PROTECT IT BUT YOU CAN'T IGNORE
IT.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT THIS AND THE
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THINGS LIKE
THAT LIKE IT'S A BAD HABIT THAT
MEN HAVE.
LIKE, OH, MEN ALWAYS LEAVE THEIR
SOCKS ON THE FLOOR.
MEN CAN'T PUT THE TOILET SEAT
DOWN.
>> GOD, I KNOW!
DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN GUYS DO
THAT?
AND WHEN THEY RAPE?
(LAUGHS)
LADIES, AM I RIGHT?
WHAT'S UP?
(LAUGHS)
OH, MY GOSH!
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: SO FEMALE SOLDIERS
SHOULD JUST EXPECT TO BE
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?
>> WELL, FEMALE SOLDIERS, GAL
REPORTERS, LADY DOCTORS,
TEACHERETTES, AVIATRIXES, THAT'S
JUST THE WAY IT IS WHEN YOU'RE A
WOMAN INTRUDING IN A MAN'S
WORLD.
WE EXPECT TO BE PAID SLIGHTLY
LESS AND RAPED SLIGHTLY MORE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I'M A... AS
A MAN, I'M OFFENDED.
MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE OF
WORKING IN CLOSE QUARTERS WITH
WOMEN IN AN APPROPRIATE,
RESPECTFUL MANNER.
>> UM, JON?
I'M UP HERE.
>> Jon: I'M LOOKING UP THERE!
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU DON'T BRING THE FRUIT IF YOU
DON'T WANT IT TO GET PICKED.
WOW.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY
MAN IS IN A CONSTANT BATTLE TO
SUPPRESS URGES TO PICK FRUIT
THAT DOES NOT WANT TO BE PICKED
BY THEM.
>> OH!
SO SOMEONE HATES WOMEN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I DON'T HATE WOMEN.
I DON'T...
>> OKAY, JUST LIKE FEMINISTS
HATE MEN BY ASSUMING THAT THEY
COULD BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN
PREHISTORIC RAPE MACHINES.
WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, IS THE
NAME OF MY ALL-GIRL PUNK BAND.
WE'RE GONNA BE AT THE ROXY THIS
WEEKEND AND, FELLAS, AS ALWAYS,
LADIES DRINK FREE IF YOU CATCH
MY DRIFT.
TWO FOR ONE ROOFIE-TINIS.
COME ON DOWN, PROTECT US; RAPE
