HE HAD FOUR, BUT HE DIDN'TLISTEN.
WE GOT HIM AT THREE.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS CIVILLIBERTIES.
>> YES.
>> SOMETHING YOU AND I AGREEON.
>> Jon: WE AGREE ON. IS ITSOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL--
IS IT LIKE A BEACH BODY?
CAN YOU GET IT BACK AFTERIT'S GONE?
IS IT THE KIND OF THING THATONCE IT ERODES WE HAVE NO
ABILITY TO RECLAIM IT IT ANDWHAT IS THE PROCESS OF
RECLAIMING IT?
>> WE RARELY RECLAIM ITONCE THE GOVERNMENT TAKES
IT FROM US.
WE ARE STILL PAYING OFF DEBTON WORLD WAR I.
WE ARE STILL SUFFERING UNDERLAWS THAT MAKE IT A CRIME TO
DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENTIN WORLD WAR I.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE GOVERNMENT LIKESPOWER.
IT'S EASIER FOR IT TOACCOMPLISH ITS PURPOSES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
WHEN IF DOESN'T HAVE A NASTYTHING LIKE FREEDOM OF
SPEECH IN THE WAY.
SO I WRITE THESE BOOKS.
I'M I'M AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITYCRITICIZER, AS YOU KNOW.
THIS GOES AFTER GEORGE W.
BUSH AND BARACK OBAMA.
I WRITE THESE BOOKS SO THEAMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS THAT
WITH EVERY TICK OF THE CLOCK,LIBERTY IS BEING LOST.
>> Jon: BUT IT'S NOT JUSTEXECUTIVE POWER.
FOR INSTANCE, YOU KNOW, WITHBARACK OBAMA, WITH HIS-- THE
BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN IRAQ ANDSYRIA, CONGRESS COULD HAVE
STEPPED IN.
WITH THE IMMIGRATION EDICT,CONGRESS COULD STEP IN.
WHY DON'T THEY?
>> CONGRESS IS -- CONGRESS IS ASMUCH A CULPRIT AS PRESIDENT BUSH
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAVEBEEN.
CONGRESS COULD STOP A LOT OFTHIS WITH THE MAJORITY VOTE.
THEY LACK THE POLITICAL WILLTO DO IT.
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES.
THE DEMOCRATS GIVE TOO MUCHPOWER TO --
>> Jon: THE JUDICIARY COULDSTEP IN. THEY CAN.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
LISTEN, BARACK OBAMA KILLEDAMERICANS WITH DRONES.
THE GRANDFATHER OF ONE OFTHOSE AMERICANS TRIED TO
STOP HIM BEFORE IT HAPPENED.
THE COURT SAID THE PRESIDENTWOULDN'T DO THAT.
YOU WANT TO ISSUE AN ORDERTO THE PRESIDENT TELLING HIM
NOT TO KILL PEOPLE?
WE DON'T BELIEVE HE WOULD DOIT AS SOON AS THEY THREW THE
CASE OUT, OVER WENT THEDRONES, DEAD WENT THE
AMERICANS.
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THISKIND OF STUFF IS HAPPENING.
>> Jon: BUT THERE WAS NO --AND YOU'RE SAYING THERE WAS NO
DUE PROCESS WITHIN THAT.
THE AMERICAN WAS SOMEONEAPPARENTLY WORKING WITH AL
QAEDA, AL-AWLAKI, IS THAT THEONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
>> THAT WOULD BE THE SAMEAMERICAN THAT THE PENTAGON
INVITED TO GIVE LECTURES TO.>> Jon: OH, IS THAT TRUE?
>> YEAH, SAME GUY.
AND A 16-YEAR-OLDKID. DUE PROCESS REQUIRES --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS LIFE,
LIBERTY OR PROPERTY, THEYHAVE TO TRY YOU FIRST.
>> Jon: SO WHO DOES, GIVE ME,GIVE ME AN AVATAR THAT IS
EXEMPLARY, A COUNTRY THAT DOESPROTECT-- IS THERE A COUNTRY,
IS THERE A SYSTEM THATPROTECTS THIS?
OR ARE YOU SPITTING IN THEWIND TO SOME EXTENT FOR A
WORLD THAT DOESN'T EXISTANYWHERE?
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS ACOUNTRY ON THE PLANET THAT
PROTECTS FREEDOM THE WAYAMERICA-- WE HAVE MORE
FREEDOM HERE.
>> Jon: SO WE'RE THE BEST.
WE'RE BAD, BUT WE'RE THEBEST.
>> YES. YES, BUT WE COULD BE, WECOULD BE A LOT BETTER,
MR. STEWART. YOU KNOW THAT.
>> Jon: BUT NOW, BUT NOW I'M INTROUBLE.
>> WHY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
>> Jon: BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVENUS AN ASPIRATION, WE'RE ONLY
COMPETING AGAINST OURSELVES.
>> YES, WE ARE COMPETINGAGAINST OURSELVES BECAUSE
EVERY PRESIDENT THAT DOESTHINGS THAT ARE UNLAWFUL
USES THE EXAMPLE OF HISPREDECESSORS WHO GOT
AWAY WITH IT.
>> Jon: BUT IF WE ARE THEBEST IN THIS SYSTEM --
>> YES.
>> Jon: SO THAT WOULD BE LIKESAYING, IF I MAY, LET'S GET RID
OF CAPITALISM, EVEN THOUGH IT'STHE BEST ECONOMIC SYSTEM.
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE THATFOR A MINUTE, THAT WE SHOULD
GET RID OF CAPITALISM? YOU'RETHE RICHEST GUY IN TELEVISION!
>> Jon: I'M TELLING YOU, THATIS, WHAT I AM SAYING IS YOU
HAVE THE BET -- IF WE ARE DOINGTHE BEST --
>> BUT WE COULD BE DOINGBETTER.
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT OURRIGHTS COME FROM OUR
HUMANITY, AND NOT FROM THEGOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: BUT THEN THAT-- UNDERSTANDING THAT,
BUT LET'S ALSO BE REALISTICABOUT PEOPLE.
NOW LET'S USE THE MIDDLEEAST AS AN EXAMPLE.
EGYPT AS AN EXAMPLE.>> RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> Jon: THEY HAVE THIS AMAZINGREVOLUTION.
MILLIONS TAKE TO THE STREETS,CALL FOR THE OVERTHROW OF AN
AUTOCRATIC REGIME.
THEY BRING IN A DEMOCRATICSYSTEM.
THEY ELECT THE MUSLIMBROTHERHOOD, A GROUP THAT WE
DON'T LIKE.>> CORRECT.
>> Jon: THEY INSTITUTE CERTAINTHINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE.
THEY RISE UP AGAIN.
GENERAL SISI TAKES IT OVER,REALLY CRACKS DOWN ON CIVIL
LIBERTIES, THE PEOPLECOULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THEPEOPLE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
>> Jon: HE'S VERY POPULARRIGHT NOW.
>> I THINK HE'S-- HE'SPOPULAR BECAUSE HE'S GIVING
AWAY THE STORE BUT HE'STAKEN MORE LIBERTIES THAN
MUBARAK DID.
AND THE REASON HE LET MUBARAKOUT OF JAIL IS SO THAT WHEN HE
GETS OVERTHROWN, HE WON'THAVE TO GO TO JAIL.
>> Jon: YOU THINK HE THINKS THENEXT DICTATOR.
>> YES, I DO.
>> Jon: BUT MY POINT BEINGTHIS.
IS THE PROBLEM REALLY THEGOVERNMENT?
OR DOES IT LIE IN US AND OURDESIRE FOR SAFETY AND FOR
LAW AND ORDER AND FORAUTHORITY?
>> ON THAT WE AGREE.
BECAUSE WHEN THE PEOPLE AREAFRAID, THEY WILL SURRENDER
THEIR LIBERTIES FOR SAFETY.
SO IT IS IN THE GOVERNMENT'SINTEREST --
>> Jon: BUT EVEN WHEN THEY'RENOT AFRAID --
>> TO KEEP THE PEOPLE AFRAID.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THAT WE WILL PAY MORETAXES.
LET THEM REGULATE MORE OFOUR BEHAVIOR.
AND THEY CAN PUT THEIR ARMSAROUND US AND SUPPOSEDLY
KEEP US SAFE.
>> Jon: BUT SHOULDN'T THEREBE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN
WHEN WE SHOULD BE AFRAID.
ARE THERE TIMES WE SHOULD BEAFRAID?
IS THERE NOTHING TO FEAR?
SHOULDN'T WE FEAR PEOPLEPOURING TOXINS INTO WATER?
>> OH, OF COURSE WE SHOULDFEAR THOSE THINGS.
OF COURSE THERE SHOULD BELAWS AGAINST IT.
>> Jon: SO IT IS A BALANCE.
>> BUT WE SHOULD -- NO, IT'S NOTA BALANCE.
IT'S A BIAS IN FAVOR OFFREEDOM, A BIAS IN FAVOR OF
FREEDOM.
FREEDOM AND SAFETY ARE NOTEQUALS.
>> Jon: YES.>> FREEDOM IS THE DEFAULT.
>> Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU ARESAYING.
>> BECAUSE WE ARE BORN WITHFREEDOM.
ANYBODY FROM NEW JERSEYKNOWS THAT.
>> Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY -- ITHOUGHT WE WERE BORN TO RUN.
STICK AROUND, THOUGH, BECAUSE IWANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS,
STICK AROUND, "SUICIDE PACT" ISON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE.
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
