>> WELCOME BACK TONIGHT.
WE WATCHED THE SECRETARY OF
STATE UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W.
BUSH'S, HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED
"NO HIGHER HONOR, A MEMOIR OF MY
YEARS IN WASHINGTON."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM CONDOLEEZZA RICE.
HELLO.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> OH, THIS IS THE ONE WE'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR!
(LAUGHTER)
"NO HIGHER HONOR."
I JUST WANT TO TURN IT THIS WAY.
OH, YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE NOT MESSING AROUND.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY
DO IS HOLLOW THAT OUT AND KEEP
ANOTHER BOOK INSIDE THERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LET'S START... YOU KNOW
WHAT WE DEAL?
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.
WE'LL START IN PRESENT DAY AND
WORK OUR WAY BACK TO THE POINT
WHERE YOU AND I STARTED.
(LAUGHTER)
SO MOAMMAR QADDAFI IS KILLED.
WERE YOU AWARE THAT HE HAD A
STRANGE AND, SHALL I SAY, CREEPY
FIXATION ON SECRETARY OF STATE
CONDOLEEZZA RICE?
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
>> I WAS AWARE.
SEVERAL OF MY FOREIGN MINISTER
COLLEAGUES HAD TOLD ME BEFORE I
WENT TO VISIT HIM BACK IN 2008
THAT HE HAD THIS FIXATION AND
WHEN I GOT THERE I THOUGHT "JUST
GET THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS.
JUST DO DIPLOMACY, JUST GET OUT
OF HERE."
AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING FINE
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SAID
"I HAVE THIS VIDEO FOR YOU."
(LAUGHTER)
AND I THOUGHT UH-OH, WHAT IS
THIS?
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY JUST
PICTURES OF ME WITH HU JINTAO,
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN OF RUSSIA
SAID TO A SONG HE HAD HAD
WRITTEN CALLED "BLACK FLOWER IN
THE WHITE HOUSE."
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HOW'S THE SONG GO?
>> IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SING.
>> Jon: I WOULD IMAGINE.
DID HE... WHAT DOES A GUY LIKE
HIM DO... LIKE, HOW DOES HE
DRESS TO IMPRESS?
BECAUSE NORMALLY HE'S THROUGHOUT
LOOKING LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN,
YOU KNOW, TYNE DALY AND MICHAEL
JACKSON.
>> WELL, HE WAS IN THE BIG WHITE
ROBE, BIG RED AFRICA PIN.
BLACK HAT.
I THINK IT WAS HIS FINEST.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
I WAS THERE BECAUSE HE'D GIVEN
UP HIS WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION AND, I'LL TELL YOU,
WHEN HE WAS IN THAT BUNKER AS
THE REVOLUTION WAS UNFOLDING ALL
AROUND THEM I WAS GLAD HE HAD
GIVEN UP THOSE DANGEROUS WEAPONS
I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE
USED THEM.
>> Jon: THEY SAID THAT HE STILL
HAD CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
>> HE STILL HAD SOME CHEMICAL
STOCKS, OLD CHEMICAL STOCKS BUT
THE REALLY DANGEROUS STUFF, FOR
INSTANCE, SOME OF THE WEAPONS
THAT HE'D GOTTEN THROUGH THE
A.Q. KHAN NETWORK, THE PAKISTANI
NUCLEAR SCIENTIST, THOSE HAD ALL
BEEN DISMANTLED IN OAK RIDGE,
TENNESSEE, OF ALL PLACES.
>> Jon: REALLY.
>> YES, RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU WATCH THE
EVENTS IN EGYPT AND TUNISIA AND
LIBYA AND ALL THAT DO YOU LOOK
AT THAT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF
SOME OF THE OTHER ACTIONS THAT
YOUR ADMINISTRATION TOOK THAT
OTHERS WERE MORE CRITICAL OF--
SAY ME--
(LAUGHTER)
DO YOU SEE THAT AS IF ONE
FOLLOWS NATURALLY FROM THE
OTHER...
>> I DO SEE IT AS A CHANGING
MIDDLE EAST AND I REALLY DO
BELIEVE THAT WE GOT ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE
FREEDOM AGENDA.
I REMEMBER HOW THE REALISTS SORT
OF RUSHED TO THE BARRICADES TO
SAY, WELL, NO, THE MIDDLE EAST
IS DIFFERENT, YOU WANT
STABILITY.
AND, OF COURSE, IT TURNS OUT
WHAT'S UNSTABLE IS
AUTHORITARIANISM.
SO WE TRIED TO GET AHEAD OF IT.
I REMEMBER GOING TO SEE MUBARAK
SAYING TO HIM MR. PRESIDENT
REFORM BEFORE YOUR PEOPLE ARE IN
THE STREETS AND HAD HE REFORMED
BEFORE THOSE PEOPLE IN THE
STREETS WE'D HAVE A LOT EASIER
TIME OF IT NOW IN THE MIDDLE
EAST BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE ARE
REACTING OUT OF ANGER AND
DESPERATION IT GETS A LOT MORE
CHAOTIC.
>> NOW IS IT... IN SOME WAYS THE
WAY THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS
NOW INTERVENED IN LIBYA, DOES
THAT MAYBE VINDICATE... IN OTHER
WORDS, A STRATEGY THAT PEOPLE
WANTED TO USE FOR TERRORISM AND
FOR THESE TYPES OF THINGS THAT
WAS SMALLER BORE?
YOU KNOW, SPECIAL FORCES,
INTELLIGENCE, USING THAT.
AT THE TIME THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION... I DON'T WANT
TO SAY RIDICULED IT BUT
CERTAINLY SPOKE THAT DOWN AS NOT
UNDERSTANDING.
>> WELL, EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS
DIFFERENT AND IN AFGHANISTAN WE
ACTUALLY WENT IN, IF YOU
REMEMBER, WITH A VERY LIGHT
FOOTPRINT, LARGELY AMERICAN
SPECIAL FORCES, AIR POWER, MEN
ON HORSE BACK WHO WERE THE
AFGHAN FIGHTERS.
IRAQ WAS A VERY DIFFERENT OF
CIRCUMSTANCES AND I KNOW WE'LL
TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> YES, I FIGURED WE MIGHT.
>> Jon: (WHIT WHISPERING)
BUT JUST BETWEEN US.
>> I GAVE YOU THE OPENING THERE.
BUT THE FACT IS MOAMMAR QADDAFI
WAS A MONSTER TO HIS PEOPLE AND
SUPPORTED TERRORISM, WAS TRYING
TO BUILD WEAPONS BUT NOTHING
LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN.
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY
CHANCE THAT AN ARAB SPRING
FLOURISHS IN IRAQ.
AN ARAB SPRING IN IRAQ LOOKS
LIKE SYRIA BUT MUCH, MUCH WORSE
BECAUSE, UNLIKE QADDAFI, SADDAM
HUSSEIN HAD MASSIVE ARMY, SADDAM
HUSSEIN HAD
400,000 PEOPLE IN MASS GRAVES,
HE USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS BEFORE.
SO I THINK A VERY DIFFERENT SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Jon: YOU'RE SAYING EACH
INDIVIDUAL HAS TO BE...
>> YOU DO.
YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME PRINCIPLE:
EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD OUGHT
TO LIVE IN FREEDOM.
BUT YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT
YOU MAY HAVE TO USE DIFFERENT
TOOLS TO GET THERE.
>> Jon: THAT'S AN EXCELLENT
POINT.
THAT'S THE ONE WE'LL... WE'LL
TAKE A COMMERCIAL AND TALK ABOUT
WHY CERTAIN TOOLS WERE USED HERE
AND OTHER TOOLS MAY BE UNTOOLED.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE
