GREATEST OF LOVE, OUR GUESTTONIGHT A YOUNG ACTOR NAMED
CAROL.
(LAUGHTER)CARELL, STEVE CARELL.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR BUT I HEAR GOODTHINGS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FIRST, LAST NIGHT WE
POKED A LITTLE FUN AT THEAPEC SUMMIT IN BEIJING FOR
MAKING WORLD LEADERS WEARGOOFY CLOTHES AND DISPLAYING
WHAT I BELIEVE PYROTECHNICPROFESSIONALS REFER TO AS
FIREWORKS OUT THE YINYANG.
(LAUGHTER)BUT FAIR'S FAIR.
THERE WERE SOME RESULTS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ANDPRESIDENT XI JINPING OF
CHINA ANNOUNCED A MAJOR DEALON CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> THE WORLD'S TWO BIGGESTPOLLUTERS AGREE TO REDUCE
THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'S-- IHAD NO IDEA THAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.
LESS CARBON EMISSIONS FROMTHE TWO OF THE WORLD'S
LARGEST POLLUTERS.
THIS CALLS FOR ACELEBRATION.
NO, THAT-- NO, THAT-- NO, NO,NO.
THE FIREWORKS THINGS ISACTUALLY WORKING-- OKAY.
I THINK THIS DEAL IS GOINGTO CALL FOR A BIT OF A
CULTURAL SHIFT.
BUT LISTEN, THIS IS GREAT, SOOBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T DO
ANYTHING REAL ABOUT THEENVIRONMENT WITHOUT CHINA ON
BOARD.
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEXTISSUE.
>> CHINESE GANGS ARE BEINGACCUSED OF SMUGGLING HUGE
AMOUNTS OF IVORY FROMTANZANIA, WITH THE HELP
OF TANZANIAN OFFICIALS.
>> CHINESE EMBASSY STAFFWERE MAJOR BUYERSES OF THE
IVORY.
THE CONSIGNMENTS OF IVORY WERESENT TO CHINA IN DIPLOMATIC BAGS
ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PLANE.
>> Jon: IVORY SENT INDIPLOMATIC BAGS.
WHAT-- WHAT IS THAT IN MYBAG?
NO -- NO, IT'S NOT ANELEPHANT TUSK, IT'S A GIANT
DILDO.
(LAUGHTER)NOT MADE OF IVORY.
I HAVE THIS THING FORINCREDIBLY OVERSIZED
POINTY DILDOS.
SO, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, THEPUNISHER AND I HAVE TO CATCH
A PLANE.
HOW YOU COULD, CHINA!
PROVIDING A MARKET FORILLEGAL POACHERS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU, CHINA,CAN EVEN LOOK AT YOURSELF IN
YOUR INCREDIBLY INTRICATELYCARVED GILDED IVORY MIRRORS.
WHAT KIND OF SOULLESS AMORALCOUNTRY WITH BE THE LARGEST
RETAIL MARKET FOR IVORY?
>> THE UNITED STATES IS THESECOND LARGEST RETAIL MARKET
FOR ELEPHANT IVORY.
>> HELLO.
(LAUGHTER)WAIT, HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY
BE?
UNLESS THE I STANDS FORIVORY.
(LAUGHTER)I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
WAS WHITE PLASTIC. NEEDLESS TOSAY OUR INSATIABLE HUNGER FOR
IVORY TRINKETS, DID YOU ENJOYTHAT, OUR INSATIABLE
HUNGER FOR IVORY TRINKETSIS HAVING A CATASTROPHIC
IMPACT ON THE IVORY'SORIGINAL OWNERS.
>> 100,000 ELEPHANTS WEREKILLED FOR THEIR TUSKS OVER
JUST THREE YEARS.
THE ANIMALS HAVE REACHED ATIPPING POINT.
WITH MORE ELEPHANTS KILLEDEACH YEAR THAN THOSE BEING
BORN.
IF IT CONTINUES, THEY WILLBE WIPED OUT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S CLEAR, WE'VE GOT TWOOPTIONS, PEOPLE.
EITHER WE AS HUMANS CANDECREASE OUR CONSUMPTION OF
IVORY BY NO LONGER BUYINGTRINKETS WE DON'T EVEN NEED.
OR ELSE ELEPHANTS CAN LOSE THATTWO YEAR GESTATION THING
AND START SHOOTINGOUT PUPS LIKE A T-SHIRT CANNON.
I MEAN CHOP CHOP,ELEPHANTS, YOUR CAREERS CAN
WAIT.
COME ON.
START [BLEEP] COME ON!
LOOK, CLEARLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAVE ELEPHANTS
BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHTTHING TO DO.
THAT'S JUST NOT US.
SO SWEETEN THE POT.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR US, THETUSKLESS.
>> TERRORIST GROUPS HAVEANOTHER SOURCE OF FAST CASH
TO BUY GUNS AND FUND THEREST OF THEIR ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES.
THEY'RE SLAUGHTERING AFRICANELEPHANTS AND SELLING THE
IVORY TUSKS FOR A LOT OFMONEY.
>> ONLY 1.6 TUSKS WOULD BEREQUIRED TO FUND A
SPECTACULAR DOUBLE TERRORISTATTACK ON TWO EMBASSIES IN
EAST AFRICA.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE SAVINGELEPHANTS CAN ACTUALLY KEEP US
FROM BEING VICTIMS INTERRORIST
ATTACKS.
I MEAN, IF WE WILL TAKE OFF OURSHOES AT AIRPORTS TO PREVENT
TERRORISM, SURELY WE CANSTOP BUYING SOUVENIR IVORY
FIGURINES MADE IN THELIKENESS OF THE IVORY DONOR.
APPARENTLY IVORY MONEY ISFUNDING ALMOST EVERY CIVIL
WAR, GENOCIDAL MILITIA ANDTERRORIST GROUP IN AFRICA,
FROM AL SHABAAB TO BOKOHARAM.
BUT YOU MIGHT BE SAYING TOYOURSELF,
DIDN'T THE U.S. BAN IVORYIMPORTS IN LIKE 1989, TO WHICH
I WOULD SAY OH, YOUHAVE A RESEARCH TEAM TOO?
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE OFTHAT.
BUT WE DID.
WE DID BAN IT.
BUT THAT WILL BE TUSK-SIZEDLOOPHOLES IN IT ME BROTHER.
>> YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TOWALK THE STREETS OF NEW YORK
AND FIND IVORY FOR SALE.
AND IF YOU ARE A COP AND SAYI THINK YOUR IVORY IS
ILLEGAL, THE FIRST THINGTHAT THE IVORY SELLER WILL
SAY TO YOU IS NO, NO, NO,MINE IS ANTIQUE.
>> Jon: OH, IT'S ANTIQUE,ANTIQUE IVORY IS
GRANDFATHERED, AND THATIS THE LOOPHOLE.
PEOPLE PRETEND THINGS AREANTIQUE.
WELL GUESS WHAT, THAT'S NOT HOWOUR LAWS WORK FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
YOU CAN'T SAY OH GEE, OFFICER,THAT COCAINE WAS PURCHASED
BY MY GRANDMOTHER IN 1912.
SO I THINK WE'RE GOOD HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT.
BACK THEN PEOPLE WERE POLITEAND HAD RESPECT.
WOULD YOU LIKE THE COCAINE?
THAT'S WHY EARLIER THIS YEARTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
PROPOSED A NEW BAN ON ALLCOMMERCIAL IVORY SALES
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.
AND STRICTER DOCUMENTATIONREQUIREMENTS FOR ANTIQUES.
>> THE NEW REGULATIONS THEYEFFECTIVELY CHANGE THE
BURDEN OF PROOF.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
IT SHIFTS THE BURDEN OFPROOF FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO
THE HOLDER OF THE IVORY TOPROVE ANY IVORY THEY HAVE IS
ANTIQUE.
>> Jon: NOW YOU KNOW DEMOCRATSARE GOING TO SUPPORT THESE
RULES, THERE ARE NO ANIMAL THEYWON'T PROTECT, THAT'S WHY
THOUSANDS OF SEVEN YEAR OLDS'HEADS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE AS
NATIONAL LICE PRESERVES.
BUT REPUBLICANS,REPUBLICANS?
ACCEPT A NEWREGULATION FROM THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, EVEN ONEDESIGNED TO SAVE THEIR
BELOVED MASCOT?
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU HAVE TERRORISTS AND
REBEL GROUPS CAPITALIZING ONTHIS TRADE.
>> WE NEED VERY AGGRESSIVEACTION.
>> I JUST FIND IT HORRENDOUSTHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS IN
THE 21st CENTURY.
>> NAIL THESE PEOPLE.(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WE HAVE JUST WITNESSEDSOMETHING RARER IN NATURE
THAN THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.
BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO ANISSUE.
NO-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> BUT OF COURSE, IT MAKESSENSE.
IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
ELEPHANTS GET PRESERVED,TERRORISTS GET DENIED FUNDING,
WHAT KIND OF AN ASSHOLE WOULD BEOPPOSED IT?
>> WE ARE FIRST DOING IS TRYINGTO DEFEAT THIS IVORY BAN.
>> Jon: OH, AN NR ASSHOLE. OHNRA,
IS THERE ANYTHING THATYOU WON'T TRY TO
KILL THAT KEEPS OTHERTHINGS FROM BEING KILLED?
WHY WOULD YOU BE AGAINSTSOMETHING THAT KEEPS ILLICIT
MONEY OUT OF THE HANDSOF TERRORISTS?
>> IT IS ALSO A FIREARMSISSUE.
BUT IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE FORANYBODY WHO HAS IVORY.
>> IT'S CRAZY.
>> THIS INVESTMENT THAT YOU JUSTINHERITED, IS WORTHLESS.
>> IT IS GOING TO DRIVE THEPRICE OF IVORY UP.
>> MAKE THE OWNERS CRIMINAL.
>> DESIGNED TO HURTAMERICANS.
>> Jon: SO I GUESS THE ONLYTHINGS THAT SHOULD BE HURT HERE
ARE GIANT LAND MAMMALS ANDVICTIMS OF AFRICAN
TERRORISM.
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT, BUNCH OFNUTS SITTING AROUND IN A STUDIO
YACKING IN A RADIO, THATCAN'T PUT A DENT ON THIS
JUST AND POWERFUL BIPARTISANCONGRESSIONAL RESOLVE.
NO LAWMAKER IS GOING TOTAKE THE BATHE.
>> FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNEDTHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS
TRYING TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS,WELL, THIS REGULATION COULD
ACTUALLY DO THAT.
I'VE INTRODUCEDLEGISLATION S2587.
THE LAWFUL IVORY PROTECTIONACT OF 2014 TO STOP THIS
MISGUIDED POLICY FROM GOINGFORWARD.
>> MOTHER [BLEEP].
SEE, THIS IS WHY WECAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.
LIKE ELEPHANTS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
