>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN, DO WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST  TONIGHT NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER RAY KELLY IS GOING TO JOIN US.
AND AFTER THE SHOW, DIRECTLY AFTER THE SHOW, HE AND I ARE GOING TO GO ON THE ROOF OF THIS
BUILDING AND WE'RE GOING TO SUMMON BATMAN.
ONLY THE POLICE COMMISSIONER KNOWS HOW TO DO.
THAT YOU SHINE A LIGHT AND THEN --
[LAUGHTER]
AS YOU KNOW, KIND OF A FUNNY THING HAPPENED IN THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AMIDST THE
WORST ECONOMY IN DECADES, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND A STEEP SPIRITUAL DECLINE, THE COUNTRY
CHOSE NOT A SELF MADE AND VIRTUOUS PATRIOT TO HEAL OUR WOES --
[LAUGHTER]
-- BUT THE SAME FOREIGN-BORN SOCIALIST TYRANT WHO CREATED ALL OF OUR WOES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW DID REPUBLICANS LOSE THIS EMINENTLY WINNABLE PRESIDENTIAL RACE?
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A SERIOUS MESSAGING PROBLEM.
>> I THINK OUR MESSAGING HAS NOT BEEN VERY STRONG.
>> THE MESSAGING WAS BAD.
>> Jon: MESSAGING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF ONLY PEOPLE KNEW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WERE ABOUT, WHAT THE REPUBLICANS NEED IS SOME KIND OF
24-HOUR A DAY SEVEN DAY A WEEK PERPETUAL MESSAGING REFINEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION RESOURCE,
PREFERLY ONE CLOSE TO THE TRAPPINGS OF JOURNALISTIC AUTHORITY BUT WITHOUT ANY ETHICAL CONSTRAINT.
WHAT WOULD WE CALL SUCH A PLACE?
ELEPHANT NEWS IS TOO OBVIOUS?
INSANE  CLONE POSSE IS ALREADY -- INSANE CLOWN POSSE IS ALREADY TAKEN.
FERRET, FERRET NEWS!
I'LL WORK ON IT.
I'LL WORK ON IT.
SO --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE REPUBLICANS LOST NOT BECAUSE OF POOR QUALITY OF THE IDEAS OR THE JEB RELUCTANCE TO HELP
GOVERN WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN TOTAL COMMAND OR THE RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH OF A GREAT
DEAL OF THEIR VOTING BASE, NO.
A MESSAGING PROBLEM.
WHICH MEANS THERE'S BUT ONE MAN WHO CAN SAME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW.
>> FRANK LUNDSTROM.
>> Jon: THE FAMED REPUBLICAN SPIN DOCTOR CREDITED WITH MASTERFUL MESSAGING AS CALLING
THE ESTATE TAX THE DEATH TAX AND MAKING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SOUND LIKE A (bleep) SANDWICH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU USED BEFORE, YOU ARE CALLING IT A PUBLIC OPTION WHICH IS WHAT THE
WHITE HOUSE CALLS IT, ARE YOU SURE IT ISN'T A GOVERNMENT OPTION?
IF YOU CALL THE THE GOVERNMENT OPTION THE PUBLIC AGAINST IT.
>> GREAT POINT I'LL CALL IT THE GOVERNMENT OPTION.
>> Jon: THANKS, FRANK.
I'M GOING TO CALL HEALTH CARE THE GOVERNMENT OPTION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE IT.
I APPRECIATE YOU TELLING ME HOW TO (bleep) EVERYBODY OVER.
THANK.
WHILE THAT'S BEEN PERFORMED,EL GOOD PEOPLE AT FERRELL NEWS BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY.
WE'LL START WITH REBRANDING THE OR WE WILLAN PROCESS ITSELF.
>> YOU KNOW ABOUT WORDS AND MESSAGING AND HOW TO DO IT, FRANK.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THE NUMBER ONE THING THE LANGUAGE ERRORS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT VERSUS ADJUSTMENT.
>> Jon: YOU SEE IT'S LANGUAGE ERRORS.
YOU NEED TO ADJUST YOUR LANGUAGE ERRORS.
I THINK THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY CALLED, THEY WANT THEIR DELIBERATELY OBFUSCATING
WORDS BACK.
THEY ARE NOT (bleep) YOU.
THEY ARE ADJUSTING LANGUAGE ERRORS.
ELMERS GLUE USED TO BE THEIR HORSE BOILING EM PORUM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.
SO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AT STAKE.
ERROR ME, AND ADJUST IT.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THE ERROR IS SMALLER GOVERNMENT.
THE ADJUSTMENT SHOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT.
WHY ARE THOSE WORDS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT?
>> BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T CARE WHAT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT IS.
>> Jon: SEE, GRETCHEN IF YOU SAY YOU WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTORATE REJECTS IT BUT IF
YOU WANT IT TO FUNCTION MORE EFFICIENTLY THE ELECTORATE LIKES IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S CLEARLY NOT
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
IT'S A POWER OF THE LANGUAGE.
THAT IS WHY THIS IS CALLED A BEARD AND NOT A CHIN-FAKING FACE PUBE.
I LIKE THIS GAME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TO ME FAIR, IT WOULD BE CURLIER IF THAT WERE THE CASE.
LET'S PLAY ERROR AND ADJUSTMENT.
>> THE ERROR IS MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE ADJUSTMENT IS SAVE AND
STRENGTHEN ENTITLEMENTS.
I GUESS THAT SOUNDS BETTER.
>> Jon: IT DOES (bleep) SOUND BETTER.
IT DOES SOUND BETTER FOR THE ACTUAL PLAN FOR
