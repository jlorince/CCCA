THE MOST INTERESTING TAKEPOT.
CAME FROM BILL O'REILLY'S THE OLD TIMEY
AMERICANA RESTORATION HOUR.
>> IF YOU USE ANY INTOXICATINGAGENT YOUR GOAL IS TO LEAVE
REALITY.
YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THECURRENT STATE OF MIND.
YOU WANT TO GET HIGH, BLASTED,WHATEVER.
SOME ADULTS CAN HANDLE THAT, SOME CANNOT.
IT'S LITERALLY RUSSIAN ROULETTE.
>> Jon: LITERALLY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUTLITERALLY?
I THINK THE ONLY DIFFERENCEBETWEEN A BONG HIT AND POINTING
A LOADED GUN AT YOUR OWN SKULLIS THAT THE GUN CAN KILL YOU
INSTANTLY AND MUST NEVER BECRIMINALIZED OR RESTRICTED IN
ANY WAY EVER -- EVER!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]AND THEN -- BY THE WAY, I WANT
TO POINT OUT TO THE AUDIENCE ATHOME, THEY ARE APPLAUDING
IRONICALLY.
[LAUGHTER]THEN THE JUST SAY NO PART OF THE
PROGRAM TOOK A BIT OF A HAIRPINTURN.
>> NOW MORE BAD NEWS, COMBINETHE DRUG ASPECT WITH THE
INTERNET.
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT BY THEAMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS,
75% OF 12-17 YEAR OLDS IN THEU.S. HAVE CELL PHONES AND
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM TEXT.
[LAUGHTER][LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHATTHE HELL JUST
HAPPENED?
HOW DO WE GO FROM JUST SAY NOAND WHAT IS WITH ALL THE BEEP
BEEP, BOOM BOOM MACHINES ANDWITH THE LOL AND THE TTYL AND
THE MUSIC AND THE DANCING ANDTHE PELVIS
AND WHOA!
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE ASURPRISING EXAMPLE OF A SOCIETY
AND CULTURE THAT IS GETTING ITRIGHT HERE THAT PERHAPS
UNDERCUTS THE INHERENT MESSAGEIN EVERYTHING YOU AND YOUR
COLLEAGUES AT FOX HAVE SAID.
>> IN CHINA THEY TEACH KIDS TOCOMPETE, TO BE DISCIPLINED, TO
LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD, NOTHERE.
>> Jon: WHY CAN'T AMERICA BEMORE LIKE THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]AND WHILE THE TRUTH IS THE
CHINESE USED TEXT MESSAGING MORETHAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD,
I GUESS THE THOUGHT BEHIND THISIS, YOU COULD KEEP KIDS FROM
TEXTING SO MUCH BY RESTRICTINGTHE SIZE OF THEIR FAMILIES
THROUGH CENTRAL PLANNING.
MY FAVORITE PART, HOWEVER, WASWATCHING A COLUMBIA PROFESSOR,
AN EXPERT ON DRUG POLICY TAKE INTHIS NEW DRUG AND TESTINGTAKE IN
PHENOMENON.
>> KIDS AND POT YOU DON'TRECOMMEND THAT, RIGHT?
>> OF COURSE NOT.
I DON'T RECOMMEND KIDS TAKINGALCOHOL OR SMOKING.
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.
TEXTING YOU KNOW IT'S ANADDICTION.
IT'S GOING CRAZY.
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?
>> I'M NOT AWARE IT'S ANADDICTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: WAIT, WAIT SMART BLACK
GUY WITH DREADS DISAGREES WITHME, I WILL DO THE OPPOSITE, GET
ME A BALD WHITE IDIOT.
>> TEXTING, THE INCESSANT USE OFFACEBOOK, THE USE OF MARIJUANA
NOW.
>> Jon: YOU'LL DO JUST FINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU YOU WERE
RAILING AGAINST THE MARIJUANATEXTING INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.
BY THE WAY FOR EXTRA BONUSPLEASURE WATCH THE GUESTS
REACTION TO DR. ABLOW'SEXPERTISE.
>> EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO CANIDENTIFY THIS AS A HUGE PROBLEM
ARE USING TEXTING.
IT DEPOSITS THEM IN A VIRTUALWORLD WHERE THEIR FEELINGS DON'T
NEED TO HAVE INTEGRITY.
WHERE THEIR INTENTIONS CAN BETHE SAME AS A POT SMOKERS,
NONMOTIVATIONAL, LOOKING FOR THENEXT HIGH.
YOU SAY TO THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I GUESS I COULD SAY
