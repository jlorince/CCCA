>> WHAT?>> EVERYTHING?
>> WHAT, NO? JUST WHAT ISN'TAUTOMATIC.
>> YOU SERIOUS? WELL, THAT'SPRETTY WONDERFUL ISN'T IT?

[APPLAUSE]YOUNG MAN, HOW ARE YOU?
HOW ARE YOU?>> I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: I'M DOING VERY WELL. I'MDOING VERY WELL.
THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
IN A SEASON OF WONDERFULPERFORMANCES, THIS HAS
BEEN A SEASON OFWONDERFUL PERFORMANCES IN FILMS,
YOUR PERFORMANCES, YOUR STEVEN
HAWKINGS PERFORMANCE IN THISFILM IS FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST
INCREDIBLE, I DON'T UNDERSTANDHOW YOU DID IT EVEN PHYSICALLY.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'TSEEN IT, YOU EMBODIED TO THE
POINT WHERE STEVEN HAWKINGSI THINK HAS SAID I FELT LIKE I
WAS WATCHING MYSELFWHEN I SAW YOU.
IT WAS AMAZING.
>> THAT WAS A VERY KIND THING HESAID.
BUT THANK YOU.
NO, IT WAS AN AMAZING.
FOR ME, HAVING THE PRIVILEGE TOPLAY HIM WAS JUST THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY THING.AND THE EXTRAORDINARY THING WAS
ALSO YOU, I THINK YOU WERE ATTHE PREMIERE.
>> Jon:  I WAS AT THE PREMIEREWHEN YOU GUYS PREMIERED IN
TORONTO.
>> IN TORONTO. I WAS SO NERVOUSAND I HAD LITERALLY COME OFF
STAGE AND THE REACTION HAD BEENKIND TO THE FILM --
>> Jon: YEAH, THE AUDIENCE WENTNUTTY.
>> AND YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSONI SAW, AND WE HAD NEVER MET.
AND I VIRTUALLY SNOGGED YOU. IBASICALLY ALMOST KISSED YOU
I WAS SO EXCITED.
>> Jon: HE WAS VERY EXCITEDAND THEN I BELIEVE I JUST
FOLLOWED YOU AROUND THE RESTOF THE WEEKEND.
NEVER ATTAINED THAT HEIGHTAGAIN. NEVER ATTAINED THAT --
IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERYGRATIFYING.
EVEN JUST THE PHYSICALTRANSFORMATION YOU WENT THROUGH,
HOW DO YOU, WERE THEREPROSTHETICS INVOLVED, HOW DID
YOU EMBODY HIS PHYSICAL DECLINE?
>> WELL, I CAN'T, IF YOU GETCAST IN A PART LIKE THIS,
SOMEONE AS EXTRAORDINARY ASSTEPHEN YOU KIND OF -- CHARLIE
COX IS ANOTHER ACTOR IN THE FILMAN OLD FRIEND WHO SAID WHEN I
GOT CAST IF YOU GET THATOPPORTUNITY YOU KIND OF HAVE NO
OPTION BUT TO GIVEYOUR EVERYTHING.
AND SO AS SOON AS I GOT CAST IBASICALLY WENT TO AN ALS CLINIC
AND STARTED KIND OF EDUCATINGMYSELF ON THE
DISEASE AND MEETING PEOPLE WHOSUFFERED FROM IT.
AND IT'S SUCH A BRUTALDISEASE. BUT THEN ALSO MEETING
STEVE AND GETTING TO SPEND A BITOF TIME WITH HIM.
I WORKED WITH A DANCER WHOHELPED SORT OF FIND THE
PHYSICALITY IN MY BODY.
IT WAS A LONG PROCESS, BUT AWONDERFUL ONE.
>> Jon: AND IT NEVER FEELSCONTRIVED. IT ALWAYS SEEMED
NATURAL. WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONEWITH ALS AND YOU'RE SAYING TO
THEM I'M GOING TO PLAY SOMEONEWHO SUFFERS FROM A SIMILAR
DISEASE, ARE THEY,  DOES IT GIVETHEM ANY JOY OR DOES IT HELP
THEM TO SHARE WITH YOU WHATTHEY'RE GOING THROUGH?
DO THEY FEEL LIKE OHTHAT'S GREAT, THANKS,
DRAMATIZE THAT, THAT'SWONDERFUL.
LIKE WHAT'S THEIR, WHAT'S THEIRSENSE OF IT?
>> NO, IT'S A REALLY GOODQUESTION. I MEAN, I WENT TO
THESE CLINICS EVERY WEEK OR TWOIN LONDON AND THE SPECIALISTS
WOULD MEET THE PEOPLE WHO WERESUFFERING. AND AT THE END
SHE WOULD SAY LOOK, THERE'S ANACTOR HERE WHO'S PLAYING STEPHEN
HAWKING AND BECAUSE STEPHEN WASGIVEN TWO YEARS TO LIVE BUT
HAS SORT OF BROKENALL THE RULES.
AND IT'S A REAL ANOMALY.
HE'S SURVIVED OVER 50 YEARS.HE'S ALSO A GREAT A BASTION OF
HOPE AND ACROSS THEBOARD PEOPLE WERE SO GENEROUS
AND THEY WOULD -- >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE YOU DO FEEL THATSENSITIVITY OF ARE YOU --
>> Jon: SURE.
>> BUT THEY WOULD LET ME LET ME,THINGS LIKE FEEL THEIR, FEEL
WHAT THE MUSCLES FEELLIKE. AND THERE ARE THESE THINGS
CALLED FASCICULATIONS, THESELITTLE SPASMS THAT GO THROUGH,
THAT REALLY THEY WERE SO KEEN TOEDUCATE ME. AND IT WAS --
>> Jon: DOES IT FEEL LIKE,  ISTHAT IT'S RIGID OR THAT IT
STIFFENS OR WHAT HAPPENS?
>> WELL BASICALLY YOU HAVE WHATARE CALLED UPPER NEURONS AND
LOWER NEURONS AND IF THEUPPER NEURONS GO THERE'S
KIND OF RIGIDITY. AND IF THELOWER NEURONS GO, IT'S A
SORT OF, THERE'S A SOFTNESS. ANDALS IS A COMBINATION
OF THOSE TWO. SO TRYING TO WORKOUT WHAT STEPHEN'S SPECIFIC
PROGRESSION WAS, THERE'S THISBRILLIANT VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
OF STEPHEN WHEN HEDID ZERO GRAVITY.
IT'S KIND OF THE ONLY TIME YOUCAN SEE HIM OUT OF THE CHAIR AND
YOU CAN SEE WHAT HIS UPPER ANDWHAT HIS LOWER.
>> Jon: OH MY GOODNESS.>> SO THAT WAS KIND OF HELPFUL
TO TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT HISPROGRESSION WAS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IS IT, IS THERE AREASON WHY SCIENTIFICALLY THAT
HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAINHIMSELF FOR THIS LONG.
HAVE THEY POINTED TO SOMETHINGEITHER GENETICALLY OR WITHIN THE
DIAGNOSIS.
>> WELL, THAT'S A GREATQUESTION.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
HE HAS BROKEN MANY RULES.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THESPECIFIC STRAIN OF THE ILLNESS.
STEPHEN, SINCE HE WAS DIAGNOSEDAGE 21,
HE'S HAD VERY LITTLE INTEREST.
HE'S, THE ILLNESS HAS ALWAYSBEEN SECONDARY TO HIM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT A LOT OF THE SPECIALISTSI MET ARE SO KEEN TO MEET HIM TO
SEE WHAT IT IS.
>> Jon:  IS IT STRANGE THAT INOW TALK TO YOU AS THOUGH YOU'RE
A NEUROSCIENTIST.>> IT IS, IT IS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: LIKE REALLY, YOU ARE.
NOW YOU'RE LIKE MY EXPERT.
IF EVER I HAVE LIKE ASCIENCE QUESTION OR LIKE
A HEALTH QUESTION I AMGOING TO CALL YOU.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASEFEEL FREE.
DON'T EXPECT A LENGTHY ANSWER.
I KNOW THAT YOU HAD JESSICAON LAST NIGHT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> AND PEOPLE KEEP SAYING I WANTYOU TO EXPLAIN "INTERSTELLAR"
TO ME.>> Jon: YES.
>> AND I SORT OF, I HAVEN'T SEENIT YET BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF I
DON'T SEE IT THEN I WON'T HAVETO EXPLAIN WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
>> Jon: YOU WON'T HAVE TOEXPLAIN ANYTHING. I'M HAVING,
THIS IS A WHOLE WEEK, I'MHAVING ACTORS ON OF MOVIES THAT
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEEMORE THAN MINE.
