( THEME SONG PLAYING )
( APPLAUSE )
>> JON: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT
RICHARD LEWIS.
THE GREAT RICHARD LEWIS GOING TO
BE JOINING US TONIGHT, TONIGHT
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
FIVE-MINUTE INTERVIEW, WE WILL
SOLVE ALL OF HIS PERSONAL
ISSUES.
TONIGHT!
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, OBVIOUSLY WITH ALL THE
TURMOIL AROUND THE WORLD, THE
ONE THING WE'VE ALL BEEN ABLE TO
COUNT ON THROUGHOUT THESE
DISASTERS IS INTREPID REPORTING.
AS BAD AS CABLE NEWS CAN BE,
THEY SEEM TO RISE TO THE
OCCASION WHEN THE OCCASION IS
COMPLETELY [BLEEPED]
[LAUGHTER]
BUT HAS THE RELENTLESS PACE
BEGUN THE TAKE ITS TOLL?
WE ANSWER THIS QUESTION IN OUR
NEW SEGMENT.
>> I'LL GIVE YOU LESSONS ON HOW
TO BECOME A REPORTER.
>> I'LL GIVE YOU SOME LESSONS.
>> PSYCHOTIC.
>> I DID NOT CALL THEM
PSYCHOTIC.
>> DO IT LIVE.
>> [BLEEPED] IT.
>> THIS [BLEEPED] THING SUCKS.
>> Jon: HOW DID THAT TURN INTO
A TIGER?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH, I DON'T
KNOW, NANCY GRACE.
WHEN WE LAST SAW NANCY GRACE,
SHE WAS STEALING A BABY FROM
JENNIFER CONNELLY AND
DISAPPEARING INTO HER LAB --
LABYRINTH.
SORRY.
WHAT?
THEY'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON?
ARE YOU SURE?
ABSOLUTELY UNCANNY.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, NEW YORK I'VE GOT TO GO.
WE'RE ON... I'VE GOT A SHOW ON
THE OTHER LINE.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NOW NANCY GRACE HAS TAKEN
HER PLACE ATOP THE RAMPARTS TO
PROTECT AMERICA'S SHORES FROM
THE ATOMIC MENACE.
>> STRAIGHT OUT THE BERNIE
RAYNO, SENIOR METEOROLOGIST
ACCUWEATHER.COM.
BERNIE, EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS
GOING TO AFFECT US.
>> WELL, IN THE UNITED STATES I
DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE
A BIG IMPACT AT ALL.
>> BERNIE...
>> THE RADIATION.
>> OH, BOY, HERE WE GO, NANCY...
>> NANCY, THIS IS NOT DAMAGING
RADIATION IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN
CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT I REMEMBER
FROM LAST WEEK WAS...
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THE
JAPANESE GOVERNMENT SAID, TOO,
DON'T WORRY, EVERYTHING'S FINE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SMART GUY WHO STUDIED
IT.
THERE'S NO RADIATION ON OUR
SHORES, HOW COME CALIFORNIA
HOSPITALS HAVE CREATESSED
EMERGENCY ROOMS?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU DON'T SET ASIDE A ROOM FOR
EMERGENCIES IF THERE AREN'T ANY,
ARE THERE?
SO WATCH HOW THE FORMER
PROSECUTOR REFUSES TO TAKE
SCIENCE FOR AN ANSWER.
>> YOU KNOW, NO MATTER HOW YOU
SLICE THIS, THIS IS NOT HEADED
TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES AS FAR
AS THE DAMAGE FROM RADIATION.
IT DOESN'T JUST MAGICALLY
APPEAR.
IT'S GOT TO GET HERE, AND THE
LARGE AMOUNTS AREN'T.
>> OKAY.
SPEAKING OF MAGIC, BERNIE, ALL
OF THAT IS SLIGHT OF THE HAND.
IT'S SMOKE AND MIRRORS.
THERE NIECE SUCH THING AS MAGIC.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SHE'S NOT TALKING
ABOUT MAGIC.
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT RADIATION.
HE WASN'T SAYING RADIATION WAS A
LEPRECHAUN.
HE WAS AGREEING WITH YOU THAT
THERE'S NO...
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S ONLY GIVING YOU THE
SCIENCE.
HE'S AGREEING WITH YOU THAT
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC.
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT WAS THAT, JON STEWART?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS THAT?
>> Jon: I WAS JUST SAYING
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC.
>> HEY, HEY, HEY, I DID NOT
SPEND SEVEN YEARS AT A BOARDING
SCHOOLING STUDYING SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
EXPELLIARMO VICTORIUS PATRONUM
APARECIUM!
JON, ARE YOU STILL THERE?
>> Jon: YEAH, I'M STILL HERE.
>> AM I STILL HERE?
>> Jon: YEAH, YOU ARE.
>> [BLEEPED] WIZARDS!
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: THE ROLE JOHN OLIVER
WAS BORN TO PLAY.
THAT WASN'T SHAKESPEARE.
SO WHILE NANCY GRACE VERSUS GUY
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING
ABOUT IS AN ENTERTAINING
UNDERCARD, THE TITLE MATCH WAS
AN INTERNETWORK BRAWL FEATURING
THE AGING FORMER CHAMPION CNN
VERSUS THE YOUNG KIDNEY-PUNCHING
UPSTART FOX, WHICH BEGAN WHEN
FOX SEEMED TO INSINUATE THAT CNN
WAS INADVERTENTLY AIDING AND
ABETTING MOMMAR QADDAFI BY
AGREEING TO ACCOMPANY LIBYAN
OFFICIALS TO THE SITE OF A
RECENT MISSILE ATTACK.
>> SOME NEWS CREWS DECIDED TO
GO, OTHERS, INCLUDING OUR STEVE
HARRIGAN, DID NOT GO TO THE
COMPOUND.
THEY WERE CONFUSED THEY COULD BE
USED AS HUMAN SHIELDS.
>> Jon: KUDOS FOR FOX FOR SO
PUTTING THE LIBYAN CRISIS INTO
PATRIOTIC SELF-PROMOTION.
THEY TURN IT INTO "FOX NEWS
ALONE REFUSES TO PLAY PATSIES TO
AMERICA'S ENEMY."
THEN THE STORY GOT MURKIER.
>> TONIGHT I LEARNED THAT
ALTHOUGH REPORTER STEVE HARRIGAN
OPTED NOT TO GO AND REMAINED
BACK AT HIS HOTEL, HE WANTED TO
STAY ON THE AIR I'M TOLD TO
PROVIDE FULL COVERAGE OF WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN LIBYA.
HE DID, IN FACT, SEND A SECURITY
GUARD WITH A CAMERA TO QADDAFI'S
COMPOUND WITH THE JOURNALIST
FROM THE OTHER NEWS OUTLET.
>> Jon: AH, WELL, FOX REPORTER
STEVE HARRIGAN WAS SO CONCERNED
THE JOURNALISTS WERE GOING TO BE
USED AS HUMAN SHIELDS, HE MADE
SECURITY GUARD JOEY EXPENDABLE
GO.
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, JOEY, YOU KNOW HOW YOU
ALWAYS SAID YOU WANTED TO BE A
REAL, LIVE REPORTER, WELL, HOW
ABOUT JUST A REPORTER?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, LOOK, THESE GUYS ARE ALL
BATTLE-HARDENED VETERAN
JOURNALISTS.
I'M SURE THE REPORTER IN
QUESTION, CNN'S NIC ROBERTSON,
WILL LET THIS ALLEGATION ROLL
OFF HIS BACK LIKE WATER OFF A
DUCK'S BACK.
>> THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
THE IDEA WE WERE SOME KIND OF
HUMAN SHIELDS WAS NUTS.
>> Jon: A LITTLE HOT IN THE
DESERT SUN I SEE.
KEEP IT ALL PROFESSIONAL, BOYS.
>> IF THEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN,
THERE STEVE HARRIGAN IS SOMEBODY
I'VE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS, I SEE
HIM MORE TIMES AT BREAKFAST THAN
I SEE HIM OUT ON TRIPS WITH
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HERE.
>> Jon: OH, [BLEEPED], OH NO
YOU DIDN'T.
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANINGS,
REPORTER SNAP, LET'S DO THIS,
BOYS.
ALL RIGHT.
SO ROBERTSON GETS ON HIM AND
HARRIGAN WAS ALL, "ROBERTSON, I
THINK YOU'RE DULL.
I FALL ASLEEP WHEN YOU GIVE A
REPORT."
HEY, HARRIGAN, WHAT HOTEL ARE
YOU STAYING AT, COWARD JOHNSONS?
TRIPLE CORRESPONDENT SLAM.
BY THE WAY, WHEN I MYSELF AM ON
THE ROAD, I ALWAYS SAY AT COWARD
JOHNSONS.
THEY LEAVE THE LIGHT ON FOR ME.
