>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THESHOW.
BEFORE THE BREAK PRESIDENTBARACK OBAMA WAS ABOUT TO GET
SOME GOOD NEWS.CONGRESS WAS ACTUALLY
GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO APPOINTHIS PREFERRED CANDIDATE
TO A HIGH PROFILE POSITION.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SET TO MAKEHIS PICK FOR THE NEXT SURGEON
GENERAL. THE WHITE HOUSEANNOUNCED THAT HE INTENDS
TO NOMINATE DR. VIVEKMURTHY FOR THE JOB.
>> THE FIRST INDIAN AMERICANSURGEON GENERAL.
>> HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOLINSTRUCTOR AND TECHENTREPRENEUR.
>> Jon: HOLD ON THERE INDIANAMERICANS, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR IVY
LEAGUE DOCTOR OR YOUR TECHGENIUS YOU CANNOT HAVE BOTH.
[LAUGHTER]HE SEEMS EVIDENTLY QUALIFIED.
LOOKS LIKE SMOOTH SAILING FORGOOD SHIP MURTHY.
>> THE SECOND CONCERN I HAVEALONG THE SAME LINE IS
ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT GUNS.
>> Jon: ICEBERG!
SOMEONE SAID THE WORD GUN WHICHMEANS IT'S TIME FOR THE NEW
SEGMENT:  AMERICA STANDS ITSGROUND.
SO WHAT WERE DR. MURTHY'SCOMMENTS ABOUT GUNS?
>> IN YOUR TWEETS OF OCTOBER 16,2012: TIRED OF POLITICIANS
WHO ARE SCARED OF THE NRA,THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WORDS.
I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD KNOW THATAMERICANS HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT TO ADVOCATE THE SECONDAMENDMENT.
>> Jon: YES, AMERICANS HAVE AFIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO
ADVOCATE THE SECOND AMENDMENTAND APPARENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE A
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO HAVE ADIFFERENT OPINION FROM THAT.
EVERYONE KNOWS THE FIRSTAMENDMENT ONLY APPLIES TO SAYING
POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT THE SECONDAMENDMENT.
THAT'S ALL. IT SAYSYOU HAVE A FIRST AMMENDMENT
RIGHT UNLESS YOUDON'T HAVE ANYTHING POSITIVE TO
SAY ABOUT THE SECOND AMMENDMENT.THEN YOU YOU HAVE TO SHUT THE
(bleep) UP. YOU HAVE TO SHUT THE(bleep) UP IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
IN ADDITION TO THAT TWEET MURTHYALSO SUPPORTS MAJORITY POPULAR
IDEAS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS ANDASSAULT WEAPON BANS IN OTHER
WORDS, STOP HIM?
>> THE NRA  AND RAND PAUL HAVEMANAGED TO WHIP UP QUITE AFRENZY OVER MURTHY.
>> THE SURGEON GENERAL OUGHT TOBE FOCUSED ON THE MAJOR
HEALTH ISSUES OF OUR COUNTRY,HEART DISEASE, CANCER, STROKE.
THOSE ARE THE KILLERS.
>> BEING AGAINST SMOKING,BEING AGAINST OBESITY, THINGSTHAT ARE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YOU KNOW, BULLETS --
[LAUGHTER]-- ARE NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED
SUPERFOODS.
[ LAUGHTER ]THEY ARE, AS WE HAVE LEARNED LOW
IN OMEGA 3 FATTY ACIDS ANDRELATIVELY HIGH IN LEAD.
BUT EVEN IF MURTHY WAS ANTI-GUNHE IS JUST THE SURGEON GENERAL.
HE IS THE NATION'S OFFICIALSCOLD. THE WORST HE COULD DO IS
PUT A WARNING LABEL ON BULLETS.THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DOESN'TMATTER ANYWAY REPUBLICANS, THE
SENATE RULE SAYS YOU CAN'TFILIBUSTER NOMINEES ANYMORE.
ALL THE PRESIDENT NEEDSIS A SIMPLE MAJORITY AND HE HAS
MORE THAN ENOUGH DEMOCRATSTO DO THAT.
>> ACCORDING TO THE NYTIMES QUOTE OPPOSITION FROM THENRA HAS GROWN SO INTENSE IT HAS
PLACED DEMOCRATS FROMCONSERVATIVE STATES SEVERAL OF
WHOM UP FOR REELECTION IN ADIFFICULT SPOT.
AS MANY AS TEN DEMS ARE BELIEVEDTO BE CONSIDERING A VOTE AGAINST
DR. MURTHY ON THOSE GROUNDS.
>> Jon: I GUESS THAT WILLTEACH DR. MURTHY TO MAKE WILD
ACCUSATIONS ABOUT POLITICIANSBEING SCARED OF THE NRA.
IS NOBODY IN AMERICA ABLE TOTAKE A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO
DRUGS -- GUNS?
>> A FIFTH GRADER IN OHIO ISSUSPENDED FOR THREE DAYS AFTER
POINTING HIS FINGER LIKE AGUN. THE PRINCIPAL SAID THERE
IS A ZERO TOLERNCEPOLICY AND STUDENTS
WERE WARNED ABOUTPRETEND GUN PLAY MULTIPLETIMES THIS YEAR.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: OH FOR (bleep) SAKE. ISAID COMMON SENSE.
COME ON, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SELFDEFENSE FINGER GUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]NOT LIKE HE HAS ONE OF THEM HIGH
CAPACITY MAGAZINE FINGER GUNS.
IT'S A REGULAR OLD FINGER GUN.
WHY -- IT'S NOT AN ASSAULTFINGER GUN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE][LAUGHTER]
EITHER I'M HUNGRY OR THOSE LOOKA LOT LIKE STACKED DOUGHNUTS.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.REAL WEAPONS ARE OKAY, GREAT.
COMPLETELY IMAGINARY WEAPONSWEAPONS ARE INTOLERABLE.
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING IN BETWEENTHERE.
>> A BIG TOY MANUFACTURER MAKINGWEAPONS NOW FOR GIRLS.
>> Jon: TOY WEAPONS FOR GIRLS.
MUST HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME TOFIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE A BOYS
WEAPON AND ADOPT IT FOR A GIRL.
I SEE.
OKAY, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.
TELL ME ABOUT THE GENTLER MOREFEMININE WEAPONS.
THIS IS EIGHT YEAR OLD GRACE'SFAVORITE TOY THE NERF REBELLE
HEART BREAKER A SPARKLY AND PINKBOW AND ARROW. SOME WONDER IF
TEACHING GIRLS TO PLAY WAR GAMESCOULD BE SENDING THE WRONG
MESSAGE NOT PROMOTINGEMPOWERMENT BUT VIOLENCE.
>> Jon: SHE TOTALLY NAILEDTHAT DUDE.
[LAUGHTER]AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M
ACTUALLY OKAY WITHTHAT. I HAVE KIDS.
I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING, THATKID HAD IT COMING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID --[LAUGHTER]
BUT HE KNOWS.
[LAUGHTER]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
