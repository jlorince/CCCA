>> Jon: SO THE UNREST NEAR
GROUND ZERO SHOWS NO SIGN OF
ABATING.
THIS MORNING THERE WAS GOOD NEWS
FOR U.S. MUSLIM RELATIONS.
IRANIAN PRESIDENT MAHMOUD
AHMADINEJAD HAS APPOINTED A NEW
AMBASSADOR.
>> PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD, IN
FACT, UNVEILED A PROTOTYPE OVER
THE WEEKEND OF THIS VERY WEAPON,
CALLING IT THE AMBASSADOR OF
DEATH.
>> Jon: WHAT?
THE... WHAT?
YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
CONCEPT OF DIPLOMACY, DO YOU?
AMBASSADOR OF DEATH.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE THIS DOOMSDAY MACHINE.
OH, MY GOD, THEY'VE GOT... OH,
OH, IT'S JOUST MISSILE DROP.
OH.
IT'S KIND OF CHEAP-LOOKING
ACTUALLY.
I WONDER HOW MANY BOX TOPS DID
THEY HAVE TO MAIL IN TO GET
THAT?
AND BY THE WAY, WHO UNVEILS A
NEW DEATH FROM ABOVE WEAPON BY
ACTUALLY PULLING A SHEET OFF IT?
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S NOT THE SHOWCASE SHOWDOWN.
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THE CONFETTI, SOME
PAINTED CLOUDS.
THEY GOT AN ENORMOUS HAND STAMP.
IT'S LIKE AHMADINEJAD'S SOME
SORT OF NOTARY FOR GIANTS, OR
HE'S EXTREMELY TINY.
COME ON, IRAN.
THIS IS THE AMBASSADOR OF DEATH.
YOU'RE ROLLING OUT A NEW WEAPON
SYSTEM.
YOU GOT TO GO WITH BRIGHT
LIGHTS, DANCING GIRLS.
COME ON, ROBERT DOWNEY, JR., IN
A TUX.
BUT THIS?
THIS IS [BLEEPED], DUDE.
I'VE SEEN HALLOWEEN HELL HOUSES
WITH BETTER PRODUCTION VALUE.
THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING FROM
RAMADAN GIGANTE.
OF COURSE, IRAN'S LATEST MOVE
ONLY PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON OTHER
MIDEAST DIPLOMATS.
>> I'VE INVITED ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU AND
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT
ABBAS TO MEET ON SEPTEMBER 2nd
IN WASHINGTON, D.C., TO RELAUNCH
DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE
ALL FINAL STATUS ISSUES, WHICH
WE BELIEVE CAN BE COMPLETED
WITHIN ONE YEAR.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I GUESS THIS TIME COULD BE
DIFFERENT.
[LAUGHTER]
SECRETARY CLINTON HAS SET A FIRM
DEADLINE.
YOU HAVE ONE YEAR, ISRAEL AND
PALESTINE, AND IF YOU HAVEN'T
WORKED IT ALL OUT IN A YEAR,
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.
>> ONE YEAR THEY WILL SIT DOWN
FOR DIRECT TALKS, IF NOTHING
HAPPEN, THEY COULD MAKE A
DECISION TO EXTEND IT.
>> Jon: YEAH!
YOU HEAR THAT?
TAKE A YEAR OR FOREVER.
HERE'S A THOUGHT, YOU WANT TO
KICK THIS THING INTO ACTION,
AFFECT THE NEW
