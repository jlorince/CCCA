>> Jon: SIMPLY BREATH TAKING.
NOW, OF COURSE, SOMETIMES A GAFFE CAN CONSIST NOT OF WHAT YOU SAID OR DID BUT WHAT YOU DID NOT DO.
CASE IN POINT.
LAST WEEK THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN RELEASED A TWO-AND-A-HALF MINUTE INTERNET AD SHOWED MITT ROMNEY
GREETING SUPPORTERS ALL ACROSS AMERICA
>> TO ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF GOOD AND DECENT AMERICANS I'VE
MET WHO WANT NOTHING MORE THAN A BETTER CHANCE, A FIGHTING CHANCE, HOLD ON A LITTLE LONGER.
A BETTER AMERICA BEGINS TONIGHT.
>> Jon: WITH A HUG.
LOOK AT ROMNEY.
HE CRAVES HUMAN CONTACT.
HE'S A PEOPLE-SOMETHING.
BUT CRITICS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE AD FALLS SHORT IN ONE REGARD.
>> IT'S GOT THE AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN.
IT'S GOT ALL OF THAT.
ONE THING THAT IT'S BEING CRITICIZED FOR IS ITS LACK OF DIVERSITY
>> IT'S HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
MAYBE HE'S RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF CAUCASIAN-STAN OR SOME PLACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYONE OF COLOR IN IT
>> Jon: A FUN FACT ABOUT CAUCASIAN-STAN ITS TOP EXPORTS INCLUDE GOLF SHOES AND JOSH GROBAN.
FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE.
LARRY?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: LARRY, WE SAW IN THIS AD, THIS AD IS THREE MINUTES LONG.
THREE MINUTES LONG.
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BLACK PERSON IN THIS AD.
>> NO, NO, NO.
NOT TRUE, JON.
IF YOU GO TO THE TAPE YOU'LL SEE A BROTHER RIGHT HERE.
BACK IT UP.
BACK IT UP.
FORWARD, FORWARD, FORWARD.
RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT THERE.
15 FRAMES OF THE BACK OF A BLACK GUY'S HEAD.
MOST LIKELY BLACK.
POSSIBLY INDIAN.
COULD BE MY PERSIAN FRIEND PARTHA.
DEFINITELY NOT WHITE
>> Jon: THAT'S A BIG OVERSIGHT THIS HAS TO BE DELIBERATE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO COMPILE THREE MINUTES OF FOOTAGE SHOT IN AMERICA AND NOT HAVE ANY
MINORITY END UP ON CAMERA.
THAT TAKES A LOT OF SKILL.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SHOT OF ROMNEY AT A RESTAURANT.
YOU MOVE THAT CAMERA JUST TO THE LEFT YOU'LL CATCH AT LEAST ONE BROTHER IN A HAIR NET.
HOW ABOUT THE SCENE WITH ROMNEY IN THE OFFICE?
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THERE'S NO MEXICANS JUST OFF CAMERA EMPTYING THE WASTE BIN.
CUT.
JOSE, GET OUT OF THE SHOT.
>> Jon: A MEXICAN COULD BE RUNNING THAT BUSINESS
>> IF HE'S A WASTE-BIN-EMPTYING BUSINESS, THAT MAKES SENSE
>> Jon: DON'T THINK ADDING A FEW BLACK FACES COULD HELP ROMNEY WITH THE BLACK VOTE?
>> I GUESS IT COULD HELP HIM WITH THE BLACK VOTE IN THE SAME WAY JUMPING GETS YOU CLOSER TO
THE SUN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO, NO, NO, JON.
NO.
THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT THE BLACK VOTE.
IT'S ABOUT THE WHITE VOTE.
>> Jon: IS THAT A THING?
IS THE WHITE VOTE A THING?
>> ABSOLUTELY, JON.
BACK IN 2008 OBAMA MADE A SERIOUS PLAY FOR IT.
HE WENT BOWLING, PUT ON HIS MOM JEANS, THREW HIS BLACK PREACHER UNDER THE BUS.
>> Jon: HE DID THE HOPE AND CHANGE THING
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU WHITE GUYS LOVE THAT STUFF.
>> Jon: VERY NICE TRUE IT'S NICE WHICH IS WHY HE WON WITH 43% OF THE WHITE VOTE.
BUT SINCE THEN, HE'S INVITING RAPPERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
WIFE'S GROWING COLLARD GREENS ON THE GARDEN.
GETTING ANGRY ABOUT THE ONE PERCENT AND PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE.
AND THIS.
â™ª ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> FIRST IT'S... PERFECT PITCH.
WHITE VOTERS ARE LOOKING AROUND THINKING WAS HE ALWAYS THIS BLACK?
IT ALL ADDS UP TO WHITE FLIGHT,
JON
>> Jon: WHITE FLIGHT?
SO ROMNEY IS POSITIONING HIS CANDIDACY AS?
>> THE SUBURBS.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON.
IT'S A NICE SAFE ENCLAVE WHERE WHITE PEOPLE CAN HIKE UP THEIR PANTS AND BASKETBALL COURTS
STILL HAVE NETS AND PEOPLE CAN SAY [BLEEP] LIKE THIS.
>> WHAT'S SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE IS SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
>> AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
NOW THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE WHITE VOTE.
WELL DONE, MITT ROMNEY.
MEANWHILE, OBAMA IS STILL OUT THERE POSING WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
GOD, WE GET IT.
YOU'RE DOWN.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S HIS FAMILY.
>> RIGHT, JON.
WE'RE ALL RELATED, RIGHT.
LOOK.
THE POINT IS YOU'RE NOT LOSING THE BLACK VOTE UNLESS YOU DO SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE.
WHAT?
HE...
>> Jon: NOTHING.
LARRY WILMORE,
EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
