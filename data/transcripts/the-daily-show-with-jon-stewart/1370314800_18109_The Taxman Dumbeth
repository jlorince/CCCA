PAPERWORK.
( LAUGHTER )
SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH
ODDTING, I.R.S.
YOU MAY HAVE PERFECTLY
REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS FOR
EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TOOK.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T NEED
YOU TO GO BACK HOME AND DIG
THROUGH ANOTHER COUPLE OF SHOE
BOXES UNTIL WE GET ONE DOCUMENT
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE
BEFORE WE CAN BE OKAY.
WHY?
THAT'S WHY.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT
AUDIT WORLD--
( LAUGHTER )
I AM LUCKY I'M LEAVING THE
COUNTRY SOON.
( LAUGHTER )
HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT
AUDIT WORLD.
WHILE WE'RE ALL BUSY LOOKING FOR
THE SMOKING GUN ON THE
GOVERNMENT TARGETING SCANDAL,
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE WE MIGHT
FIND?
>> THIS VIDEO MADE BY I.R.S.
EMPLOYEES TO CLOSE OUT A 2010
I.R.S. CONFERENCE.
ACCORDING TO THE VIDEO'S
NARRATOR THOSE TAKING PART ARE
COMPETING TO BECOME THE NEXT
GREAT DANCE SENSATION.
>> WE'RE TOLD THE CUPID DANCE
VIDEO COST $1600 TO MAKE.
>> Jon:  TWO THINGS--
( LAUGHTER ).
FIRST, AFTER WATCHING THAT
VOORKS I'M PRETTY CONVINCED IT
WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE
I.R.S. TO COORDINATE ANYTHING.
( LAUGHTER )
LET ALONE A MACHIAVELLIAN
POLITICAL PLOT.
AND, NUMBER TWO, HOW THE
( BLEEP ) DID THAT COST $1600?
( LAUGHTER )
DID THE GUY RECORDING IT DROP
HIS iPHONE THREE TIMES?
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
$1600!
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD.
YOU WRITE THAT OFF AS A MORALE
BOOSTER, IT'S OKAY.
>> $60,000 TO MAKE A PAIR OF
DIFFERENT VOOZ, SPOOFS OF
"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND" AND "STAR
TREK."
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  THOSE MAY BE THE
WORST PARODIES I'VE EVER SEEN.
THEY REALLY--
( APPLAUSE )
IT ACTUALLY GIVES ME A LOT
MORE-- LET ME SAY THIS.
I ACTUALLY NOW HAVE A LOT MORE
RESPECT FOR THE DIRECTORS OF
"HOW I WET YOUR MOTHER."
YOU KNOW, $1600.
REALLY?
GOING TO TAKE THAT DOWN, HUH?
1600 THERE, 60 GRAND THERE.
ANY OTHER BUSINESS EXPENSES YOU
WANT TO TRY TO DEDUCT, I.R.S.?
>> THE I.R.S. SPENT ROUGHLY $49
MILLION ON 220 EMPLOYEE
CONFERENCES.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP ).
YOU SPENT ALMOST $50 MILLION ON
220 CONFERENCES?
THAT'S--
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S ONLY IN THREE YEARS.
THAT WORKS OUT TO, LIKE, $8
MILLION A CONFERENCE.
( LAUGHTER )
OH, THAT'S NOT ON.
( LAUGHTER )
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ACTUALLY-- I THAIT THAT WAS
ON.
I THOUGHT I HAD IT ON.
IT'S $250,000 PER CONFERENCE.
EVEN THE GUYS WHO THROW THE
PLAYERS' BALL ONLY SPEND, LIKE,
20 GRAND AND THEY'RE DRINKING
OUT OF ONE OF THESE.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T CARE,
I.R.S., IF YOU KEPT THE RECEIPT.
EVEN IF THE CONFERENCES WERE FOR
A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS EXPENSE--
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS AUDIT'S GOING TO ACHE A
WHILE I.R.S. AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE I KNOW OF
WHO CAN HELP YOU THROUGH IT.
>> ARE YOU BEING AUDITED?
THE TAX MASTERS WILL SOLVE YOUR
TAX PROBLEMS.
>> Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
