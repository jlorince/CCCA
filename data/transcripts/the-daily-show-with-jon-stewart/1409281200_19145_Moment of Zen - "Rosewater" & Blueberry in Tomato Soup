>> Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW,BEFORE WE GO, QUICK THING,
AS YOU KNOW, FOR THE LAST FEWYEARS I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON
THIS PROJECT, THIS FEATURE FILM, IT WAS WHY I WAS GONE LAST
SUMMER.
AND I LEFT THE SHOW TO BE HOSTEDBY JOHN OLIVER, WHO WAS SO BAD
AT IT, I DON'T THINK HE'SEVER BEEN HEARD FROM AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
I THINK HE'S OUT OF THEBUSINESS.
BUT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A FRIEND,A JOURNALIST, MAZIAR BAHARI.
THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT HELD HIMCAPTIVE IN 2009 FOR REPORTING ON
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE'S HISTORICPROTEST FOR FREEDOM THERE.
AND WHILE HE WAS IN TEHRAN,MAZIAR HAD ALSO TAPED A
"DAILY SHOW" INTERVIEW WITH OUROWN JASON JONES, AND WHO, AND I
THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS FUNNY,IRAN'S GOVERNMENT THEN ACCUSED
OF BEING AN AMERICAN SPY.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE LAUGH THEYHAD WHEN THEY REALIZED THEIR
MISTAKE, AND BY LAUGH I MEANBRUTAL INTERROGATION OF MAZIAR
FOR WEEKS.
MAZIAR WROTE THIS INCREDIBLEBOOK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE.
WE TURNED IT INTO A FILM WITHTHE INCREDIBLE GAEL GARCIA
BERNAL AS MAZIAR.
IT'S GOING TO COME OUT INNOVEMBER, BUT THE TRAILER IS
BEING RELEASED TODAY.
IT OCCURRED TO ME SINCE I HAVE ANIGHTLY TELEVISION SHOW...
[LAUGHTER]I COULD MENTION IT AND SHOW YOU
A COUPLE OF SCENES THAT AREN'TIN THE TRAILER BUT GIVE YOU A
SENSE OF SORT OF WHY WE GOTINVOLVED.
THIS IS A QUICK ONE FROM THEMOVIE, IT'S A RE-ENACTMENT OF
MAZIAR AND JASON'SINTERVIEW IN TEHRAN.
>> ACTUALLY AMERICANS ANDIRANIANS HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN
COMMON MORE THAN THEYHAVE DIFFERENCES.
>> WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON WITHYOU?
>> WHAT IS THE NUMBER-ONE ENEMYOF THE UNITED STATES?
>> AL QAEDA.
>> AL QAEDA IS ALSO THE NUMBERONE ENEMY OF IRAN.
THE AL QAEDA MEMBERS SAY THAT IFYOU KILL AN IRANIAN OR IF YOU
KILL A SHIITE, YOU GO TO HEAVENAND YOU GET 72 VIRGINS.
>> WELL, THEY WON'T BE VIRGINSFOR TOO LONG, HUH?
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?UPSTAIRS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THAT'S JASON JONES,
VERY TALENTED ACTOR, AND IT'SWHY HERE WE MOSTLY HAVE HIM
PUTTING HIS PENIS INTOCANTALOUPES.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DO THAT.
WE REALLY HAVE TO UTILIZE HIMBETTER. AND, SO TO JUST GIVE
YOU A SENSE, THIS IS MAZIAR INPRISON AND HIS
INTERROGATOR IS CONFRONTING HIMWITH THIS DAMNING EVIDENCE.
>> SIR, YOU'RE MAKING A BIGMISTAKE.
I AM A JOURNALIST.
THAT'S IT.
NOTHING MORE.
>> JUST A JOURNALIST.
>> YES.
>> AS A SPY, I'M JUST TRYING TOFIGURE OUT WHY YOUR COUNTRY IS
SO TERRIFYING.
>> FIRST THING TO KNOW ABOUTIRAN IS THAT IT IS NOT EVEN.
AMERICANS AND IRANIANS HAVE ALOT OF THINGS IN COMMON MORE
THAN THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES.
>> WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON WITHYOU?
>> SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHYJUST A JOURNALIST WOULD MEET UP
WITH THIS AMERICAN SPY.
>> HE'S NOT A SPY.>> HE'S NOT A SPY?
>> NO, IT'S A SHOW.>> IT'S A SHOW?
>> IT'S A COMEDY SHOW.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO, IT'S STUPID.
>> IT'S VERY STUPID, YES.
>> HE'S A COMEDIAN PRETENDING TOBE A SPY.
>> SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHY ANAMERICAN PRETENDING TO BE A SPY
HAS CHOSEN TO INTERVIEW YOU?
>> AND WHY WOULD A REAL SPY HAVEA TV SHOW?
