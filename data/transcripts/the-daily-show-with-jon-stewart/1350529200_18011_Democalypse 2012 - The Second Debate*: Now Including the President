[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NICE ONE
FOR YOU TONIGHT.
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" 538
BLOCK, STATISTICIAN ALL-STAR
NATE SILVER WILL BE JOINING US
ON THE SHOW.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND THEN TOMORROW NIGHT IT'S
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
BUT STILL...
[LAUGHTER]
THESE PEOPLE GET TO...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NATE SILVER, THE PRESIDENT OF
STATISTICIAN-STAN.
AS YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAM PAN HEADED TO
HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY WHERE THE
CANDIDATES DEBATED FROM A
DIVERSE CROWD HARD OF LONG
ISLANDERS RANGING FROM ITALIAN
GUYS TO OTHER ITALIAN GUYS TO A
JEWISH GUY AND HIS MOM.
[LAUGHTER]
SUCH DIVERSITY IN LONG ISLAND.
THE FIRST QUESTION SOMEHOW ENDED
UP ON THE AUTO INDUSTRY RESCUE.
>> I KNOW YOU KEEP SAYING, YOU
WANT TO TAKE DETROIT BANKRUPT.
WELL, THE PRESIDENT TOOK DETROIT
BANKRUPT.
YOU TOOK GENERAL MOTORS
BANKRUPT.
YOU TOOK CHRYSLER BANKRUPT.
THAT WAS PRE-SIZELY WHAT I
RECOMMENDED AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
HAPPENED.
>> Jon: OKAY.
IN FACT, OBAMA'S PUBLICLY
FINANCED DETROIT AUTO INDUSTRY
MANAGED BANKRUPTCY IS NOT
PRECISELY WHAT ROMNEY
RECOMMENDED.
ROMNEY PRECISELY RECOMMENDED
PRIVATE CREDIT, WHICH AT THE
TIME WAS TO BE PRECISE
NON-EXISTENT.
MEANING UNDER HIS PLAN DETROIT'S
BANKRUPTCY WOULD HAVE BEEN
UNMANAGED AND QUITE PERMANENT.
SO THE BIG QUESTION WOULD BE:
WHICH VERSION OF BARACK OBAMA
WOULD RESPOND.
THE FIRST DEBATE, SLEEPY TIME MA
GILL CUTTY OR PRETTY TALK JONES.
>> CANDY, WHAT GOVERNOR ROMNEY
SAID JUST ISN'T TRUE.
>> Jon: IT'S ALIVE!
IT'S ALIVE!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WHOA, WHOA.
YES, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
DECIDED TO ATTEND THIS DEBATE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THE TWO CANDIDATES COULD
FINALLY HAVE A TRUTHFUL,
SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW
MUCH THEY [BLEEPED] HATE EACH
OTHER.
[LAUGHTER]
>> GOVERNOR, WE HAVE ACTUALLY
PRODUCED MORE OIL.
>> NO, NO, HOW MUCH DID YOU CUT
LICENSES AND PERMITS ON FEDERAL
LAND AND FEDERAL...
>> PRODUCTION IS UP.
>> IT'S DOWN.
>> NO IT ISN'T.
>> PRODUCTION ON GOVERNMENT LAND
AND OIL IS DOWN 14%.
>> GOVERNOR, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
JUST NOT TRUE.
>> YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE IN A
MOMENT.
I'M STILL SPEAKING.
THE ANSWER IS --
>> IF YOU'RE ASKING A QUESTION.
>> THAT WASN'T A QUESTION.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> JON JON I
