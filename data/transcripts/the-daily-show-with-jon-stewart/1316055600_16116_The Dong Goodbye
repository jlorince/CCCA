[LAUGHTER]
BUT WE TURN NOW TO A LOCAL
STORY, A SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL
ELECTION.
IT WAS HELD YESTERDAY IN NEW
YORK'S NINTH DISTRICT, A
PREDOMINANTLY JEWISH AND ASIAN
AREA OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS.
I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S FOOTAGE
FROM THE MOVIE "DISTRICT NINE."
[LAUGHTER]
I APOLOGIZE.
DO WE HAVE ANY IMAGES FROM THE
ACTUAL NINTH DISTRICT OF
BROOKLYN AND QUEENS?
THANK YOU.
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
ANY HOW -- LUCKY.
MMM, MMM.
ASK YOUR PARENTS.
ANY WHO, IF YOU REMEMBER, THE
FORMER HOLDER OF THAT
CONGRESSIONAL SEAT WAS DEMOCRAT
ANTHONY WEINER, WHO FOR SOME
REASON WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE
HIS TERM.
WHAT WAS THAT?
>> CONGRESSMAN WEINER, A
CONTRACT, IS NOW INFAMOUS FOR
SOME REVEALING SELF-PORTRAITS
SENT TO WOMEN ONLINE.
JON JON OH, YES, THE
SELF-PORTRAITS HE SENT TO WOMEN
ONLINE.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LITTLE
GRANDIOSE TO CALL THIS A
SELF-PORTRAIT.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, THESE
SELF-PORTRAITS SHOW NONE OF THE
MONOCHROMATIC GRAND -- GRANDEUR
OF PI -- PICASSO'S WORK OR
SEURAT'S WORKS.
IF YOU ENJOY THESE, THERE'S
PLENTY MORE IN OUR BOOK, "JOKES
FOR HISTORY MAJORS."
[APPLAUSE]
BY THE WAY, THAT'S... IT'S
PRONOUNCED [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY.
I JUST DO IMAGINE AN ART HISTORY
MAJOR WATCHING THE SHOW RIGHT
NOW GOING, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY
GOD, OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT US.
ANYWAY, SPECIAL ELECTIONS, BUT
STILL IT'S A FAIT ACCOMPLI.
WHOEVER THE DEMOCRATS RAN ARE
GOING TO TAKE THAT SEAT.
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE BLUEST
DISTRICTS IN THE NATION.
THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS
OUTNUMBER REPUBLICANS THREE TO
ONE, HASN'T SENT A REPUBLICAN TO
WASHINGTON IN 1923.
>> 1923.
88 YEARS.
THE LAST TIME THAT NINTH
DISTRICT HAD A REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN, HARLEM CONGRESSMAN
CHARLIE RANGEL HADN'T EVEN
STARTED HIS 15th
CONGRESSIONAL TERM YET.
HE'S BEEN THERE A WHILE.
SO HOW BAD DID THE D'S SHELLAC
THE R'S.
>> REPUBLICAN BOB TURNER ON
TUESDAY WON THE HOUSE SEAT THAT
WAS VACATED BY DEMOCRAT ANTHONY
WEINER.
>> Jon: WHAT!
HOW DID THE DEMOCRATS SQUANDER A
GIMME?
THEY HAVE A POWERFUL MACHINE IN
NEW YORK.
SURELY DAVID WEPRIN MUST HAVE
PICKED UP SOME BIG-NAME, PARTY
ENDORSEMENTS.
>> THIS IS ED KOCH.
REMEMBER ME?
I WAS ONCE YOUR MAYOR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU WERE, WEREN'T YOU?
I REMEMBER.
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME?
>> YOU KNOW WHY I'M CALLING YOU?
I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR BOB
TURNER FOR CONGRESS ON TUESDAY.
>> Jon: HOLY [BLEEPED] BALL.
ED KOCH BACKED THE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE.
DID WEPRIN GET ANY ENDORSEMENTS?
♪ BOB, BA, BOB ♪♪
>> Jon: THAT'S BOWSER FROM
SHA-NA-NA.
ASK YOUR PARENTS TO ASK THEIR
PARENTS.
WANT TO KNOW HOW WEAK A
CANDIDATE DAVID WEPRIN WAS?
>> NEXT TUESDAY MORNING I'M
GOING TO VOTE.
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE CAMERAS
AROUND.
I LIVE IN THE DISTRICT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
>> FIRST OF ALL, MY MOTHER LIVES
IN THE DISTRICT.
I'LL BE HAPPY TO GO WITH HER TO
VOTE.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, YOU
DON'T LIVE IN THE DISTRICT YOU
RAN TO REPRESENT, AND TWO,
YOU'RE HAPPY TO GO WITH YOUR MOM
TO VOTE?
SURE.
DAVID, WHY ARE YOU WALKING SO
FAST?
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE, NOT PUT OUT
A FIRE.
BY THE WAY, YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHO CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY, ED
KOCH.
HE HATES YOU.
ARE YOU STILL RUNNING WITH THAT
GREASER FROM THE ACT PELL LA
GANG?
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.
THE DEMOCRATS LOSE A
CONGRESSIONAL SEAT THEY HELD FOR
88 YEARS.
THE GREAT DEPRESSION COULDN'T
WREST THE SEAT FROM THEIR HAND,
WORLD WAR II, THE RED SCARE,
EVEN THE REAGAN REVOLUTION.
THE ONLY THING POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE
DEMOCRATS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS
WAS
