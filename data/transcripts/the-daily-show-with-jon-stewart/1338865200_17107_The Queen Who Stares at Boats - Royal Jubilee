FIREWORK.
FOR MORE ON THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE CELEBRATION WE TURN TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON.
JOHN OLIVER, NICE TO SEE YOU.
OH, MY GOSH.
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS.
WHAT'S THE MOOD LIKE OVER THERE?
>> (CRYING ) DID YOU SEE THE BOAT, JON?
>> Jon: I DID.
CALM DOWN, JOHN.
>> DID YOU SEE THE ONE BOAT TURN AROUND?
DID YOU SEE THAT?
>> Jon: JUST BREATHE, JOHN.
JUST BREATHE.
>> I'M SO SORRY.
I'M GOOD.
JON, IT'S THE QUEEN AND THE BOATS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AND THE BOATS AGAIN AND THE
QUEEN ON THE BOAT.
AND THE BOAT AND THE QUEEN.
>> Jon: IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IT'S RAINING, JOHN.
>> NO, IT'S NOT RAINING HERE,
JON.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S A SUNNY DAY.
>> Jon: REALLY, BECAUSE YOU LOOK SOAKING WET?
>> NO, PROBABLY JUST EXCITEMENT SWEAT.
FROM THE BOATS AND THE QUEEN ON THE BOAT AND THE TURN.
>> Jon: NO NEGATIVES.
THERE'S NO NEGATIVES FROM THE EVENT AT ALL?
EVEN IN A TIME OF AUSTERITY IN GREAT BRITAIN.
>> JON, OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND NOT THINK
ABOUT WHAT IT REPRESENTS.
THE SAD LAST GASP OF A ONCE POWERFUL EMPIRE.
ITS BEST DAYS LONG BEHIND IT DESPERATELY TRYING TO CONJURE UP A HAPPIER TIME WHEN IT WAS
SOMETHING MORE THAN A DECAYING RELIC.
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY A PRETTY HARSH THING TO SAY ABOUT YOUR OWN HOMELAND.
>> NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT CNN.
Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
THEY SAY THE SUN NEVER SETS ON CNN'S MIGHTY NEWS EMPIRE.
REMEMBER, THIS IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT COVERED THE FIRST GULF WAR.
NOW LOOK WHAT THEY'VE BEEN REDUCED TO.
A BUTLER SPENDING TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT BARGES.
LOOK UPON YOUR WORK, TED TURNER,
AND DESPAIR.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
IT APPEARS THE RAIN IS INCREASING, JOHN.
>> NO, NO, NO.
IT REALLY ISN'T.
YOU KNOW THE CAMERA ADDS TEN POUNDS.
THIS IS JUST A LIGHT DRIZZLE,
JON.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
JOHN, IT APPEARS TO BE RAINING BAKED BEANS.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
>> (MUMBLING ).
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
WAIT, IS THAT...
>> (MUMBLING ) DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: SHOULDN'T THEY JUST CANCEL THE PARADE?
IF THE WEATHER IS GOING TO BE THIS BAD AGAIN, JUST CANCEL IT?
>> NO, WE DO NOT CANCEL IT, JON.
THIS IS ENGLAND.
WE DON'T BACK DOWN, NOT FROM NAZIS, NOT FROM RAIN, NOT FROM TOAST AND ESPECIALLY NOT FROM
[BLEEP].
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
