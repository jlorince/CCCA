BOTH LAYING NEXT TO A ROTTEN
BANANA.
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS MAGICAL
AMENDMENT THAT HAS BROUGHT
EVERYONE TOGETHER?
>> WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ONE
QUESTION FOR THE PEOPLE WE
REPRESENT.
DO WE OPPOSE THE SUSPICION LIST
COLLECTION OF EVERY AMERICANS'
PHONE RECORDS.
MY AMENDMENT MAKES A SIMPLE BUT
UPON CHANGE.
IT LIMITS THE GOVERNMENT'S
COLLECTION OF THOSE RECORDS...
OF THE RECORDS SO THOSE RECORDS
THAT PERTAIN TO A PERSON WHO IS
IS THE SUBJECT OF AN
INVESTIGATION.
>> John: NO LONGER WILL WE ALLOW
THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE OUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION.
WE WILL KEEP IT WHERE IT
BELONGS: ON FACEBOOK.
ON GOOGLE.
ON TWITTER.
ON INSTAGRAM.
ON LINKED-IN.
EVEN THOUGH I KEEP TELLING
LINKED-IN TO STOP SENDING ME
EMAILS.
LEAVE ME ALONE, LINKED-IN.
I'M ON TELEVISION.
UNSUBSCRIBE... SUBSCRIBE.
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
DO, LINKED IN.
YOU SEEM TO HAVE MONETIZED
IRRITATING PEOPLE.
NEVERTHELESS, THIS PROPOSED
AMENDMENT TRIGGERED ONE OF THE
RAREST SIGHTS IN NATURE.
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS HAS
NEVER BEEN CAUGHT ON CAMERA
BEFORE: DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS BOTH NATURAL
PREDATORS FEASTING ON THE SAME
TALKING POINT.
>> WHAT IT DOES DO IS PREVENT
THE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
NOT SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATION.
>> MANY AMERICANS FEEL THAT OUR
FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES AS A
COUNTRY AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS ARE THREATENED.
>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING VIOLATES
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.
>> BEN FRANKLIN SAID THEY WHO
GIVE UP ESSENTIAL LIBERTIES TO
OBTAIN A LITTLE TEMPORARY
SAFETY.
>> THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO TRADE
LIBERTY FOR SECURITY WILL FIND
THEY HAVE NEITHER.
>> John: SIDE NOTE.
IT TURNS OUT WATCHING C-SPAN
WITH BINOCULARS IS EXACTLY AS
BORING AS WATCHING C-SPAN
WITHOUT BINOCULARS.
SO, LOOK, THAT'S GREAT NEWS FOR
THIS BUILDING BECAUSE WE ALL
KNOW IF YOU CAN GET BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT FOR SOMETHING IT'S GOING
TO PASS.
UNLESS ANOTHER BIPARTISAN GROUP
EMERGES TO FIGHT IT.
BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.
IS THERE IN ROLL THE TAPE.
>> THE TOP THREE REPUBLICANS IN
THE HOUSE OPPOSE THE MEASURE.
>> A TOP REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT
OF THE COMMITTEE RELEASED A
JOINT STATEMENT CALLING IT
UNWISE.
A WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A
STATEMENT URGING THE HOUSE TO
REJECT IT.
>> John: JOHN BOEHNER AND
PRESIDENT OBAMA AGREE ON
SOMETHING.
THE ONLY OTHER THINGS THEY'VE
EVER AGREED ON WERE, ONE,
ESTIMATION YOU NEED A GOOD CRY.
TWO, MICHAEL KEATON IS IS A BEST
BATMAN AND THREE, BRAZIL NUTS
ARE NOTHING MORE THAN PACKING
MATERIAL FOR ALL THE OTHER NUTS
IN THE MIX.
SO THEY GOT A FOUR.
NOTHING SHOWS THOUGH JUST HOW
WEIRD THESE COALITIONS HAVE
BECOME THAN THE FACT THAT THE
PRESIDENT ALSO ENDED UP ON THE
SAME SIDE AS THIS PERSON.
>> THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
TAKING IN THE CONTENT OF
AMERICAN PHONE CALLS.
IT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
WE NEED TO DEAL IN FACTS.
LET'S DEAL IN REALITY, NOT IN
FALSE NARRATIVES.
>> John: YES, YES.
WAIT, WAIT.
YOU'RE JUMPING AHEAD.
YOU HEARD KROACTLY.
MICHELLE BACHMAN JUST ARGUED
WHAT WE SHOULDN'T DEAL IN FALSE
NARRATIVES.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FALSE NARRATIVE
THAT SAYS MICHELLE BACHMAN
DOESN'T DEAL IN FALSE
NARRATIVES.
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES WILL BE TAKING A TRIP
OVER TO INDIA THAT IS IS
EXPECTED TO COST THE TAX PAYER
DLZ 200 MILLION A DAY.
HER LITTLE DAUGHTER TOOK THAT
VACCINE, THAT INJECTION AND SHE
SUFFERED FROM MENTAL RETARDATION
THEREAFTER.
THE VERY FOUNDERS THAT WROTE
THOSE DOCUMENTS WORKED
TIRELESSLY UNTIL SLAVERY WAS NO
MORE.
THEY USE THE U.S. CENSUS
INFORMATION TO ROUND UP THE
JAPANNESE AND PUT THEM IN THE
INTERNMENT CAMPS.
THERE ISN'T EVEN ONE STUDY THAT
CAN BE PRODUCED THAT SHOWS THAT
CARBON DIOXIDE IS A HARMFUL GAS.
>> John: THAT IS A WAKE-UP CALL.
YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN
MICHELLE BACHMAN IS ON YOUR
SIDE, YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT
THE SIDE THAT YOU ARE ON.
SHE IS THE CANARY IN THE CRAZY
MINE.
I MYSELF WEAR A BRACELET
EVERYDAY THAT READS WHAT
WOULDN'T MICHELLE BACHMAN DO.
SO, LOOK, 56% OF THE PUBLIC SEEM
TO BE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT
RESTRICTING THE GOVERNMENT'S
PHONE DATA COLLECTION.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.
>> THE N.S.A.'S CONTROVERSIAL
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM IS HERE TO
STAY.
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE HOUSE VOTED
DOWN AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD
HAVE DEFUNDED THE PROGRAM THAT
COLLECTS DATA ON AMERICANS'
PHONE RECORDS.
>> John: THIS IS THE WORKS.
YES.
THIS IS THE WORKS.
ONCE AGAIN, CONGRESS FAILS TO
GET SOMETHING DONE.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THIS
TIME THEY FAILED TO GET IT DONE
TOGETHER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
