(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)YOU KNOW WHAT, I ALSO, I WANT TO
UPDATE YOU ON A STORYFROM LAST WEEK
WAS AN EPIC ONGOING BATTLEBETWEEN THE FORCES OF (BLEEP)ERY
AND THE FORCES OF DUMBASSERY ORAS THEY SOMETIMES REFER TO
THEMSELVES REPUBLICANS ANDDEMOCRATS.
NOW, WHEN WE LAST LET THISSOUL-CRUSHING TALE OF MODERN
LAWMAKING, AN ANTI-SEXTRAFFICKING BILL WAS STUCK IN
CONGRESS WHILE THE PARTIESFOUGHT OVER WHETHER FINES
COLLECTED FROM SEX TRAFFICKERSCOULD BE USED BY FORMER SEX
SLAVES FOR ABORTIONS.AND IF NOT, WHETHER THAT WOULD
BE AN EXPANSION OF THE HYDEAMMENDMENT.
DEMOCRATS RECEIVED ADDITIONALDUMBASSRY POINTS FOR NOT
ACTUALLY READING THE BILL THEHYDE AMMENDMENT WAS INSTERTED
INTO BEORE THEY VOTED IT OUT OFCOMMITTEE BECAUSE
WHY WOULD YOU DOSOMETHING THATIS YOUR LAST NAME.
ALL RIGHT, AND THE G.O.P.BOOSTED ITS (BLEEP)ERY SCORE BY
REFUSING TO CONFIRM ATTORNEYGENERAL NOMINEE LORETTA LYNCH
UNTIL THE DEMOCRATS STOPPEDBLOCKING THE SEX TRAFFICKING
BILL.
BUT GOOD NEWS.
SOME HAVE REPORTED SIGHTINGS OFTHAT RAREST OF BEASTS,
LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE.
>> LET'S MAKE THIS FUND SUBJECTTO THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS
PROCESS, SUBJECT TO THEAPPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND THE
USUAL RIDERS THAT HAVE EXISTEDFOR 39 YEARS.
IT WOULD BASICALLY, AGAIN,MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO.
>> Jon: CORNYN IS BASICALLYSAYING, ALL RIGHT, DEMOCRATS,
(BLEEP) IT.
HOW ABOUT WE DO NOTHING?
HERE'S YOUR OUT, WE'LL PASS THEANTI-SEX TRAFFICKING BILL WITH
THE ANTI-ABORTION LANGUAGE BUTHAVE IT MORE CLOSELY ADHERE TO
THE FEDERAL ANTI-ABORTION RULESTHAT DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY
ACCEPTED FOR DECADES. IS ITEVERYTHING DEMOCRATS WANT?
NO.
BUT IT'S THE BEST THEY'RE GOINGTO GET BECAUSE THEY LOST THE
ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS ANDTHEY'RE PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE IN
THE SENATE NOW SO THEYBETTER ACCEPT IT.
IT'S LIKE BEING PLAYING TWO INSUPER MARIO BROTHERS.
YOU GET TO PLAY BUT YOU'REALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TO BE
LUIGI. I KNOW IT SUCKS TO BELUIGI. NOBODY WANTS TO BE LUIGI,
GLORIFIED WING-MANSTANDING BY AS HIS MORE
POPULAR, CHARISMATIC BROTHER HASSOME WEIRD INTERACTIONS
WITH THE PRINCESS, BUT IFLUIGI'S LUCKY HE GETS TO SETTLE
FOR A LACK LUSTER HAND JOB FROMWHATEVER THE HELL THIS THING IS.
WE DON'T KNOW!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DEMOCRATS SHOULD JUST ACCEPT IT!
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?
THEY TURNED DOWN THE OFFER ANDTOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO
PUSHING LYNCH'S CONFIRMATIONTHROUGH.
>> SEVERAL DEMOCRATS AREALLEGING RACISM IN THE SENATE'S
DELAYED VOTE ON THE U.S.ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE
LORETTA LYNCH.
>> Jon: OH (BLEEP).
>> LORETTA LYNCH, THE FIRSTAFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN NOMINATED
TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ASKEDTO SIT IN THE BACK OF THE BUS
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SENATECALENDAR.
>> Jon: OH, FOR (BLEEP) SAKE.
NO, SHE'S NOT BEING ASKED.
SHE'S WAITING ON A CONFIRMATIONVOTE TIED TO ANOTHER BILL.
IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW MY GUESSIS THERE IS NOT A SENATE
PROCEDURAL MOTION YOU COULDSUBJECT A PERSON TO THAT WOULD
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF JIM CROWSEGREGATION.
CHANGING THE AMENDMENT PROCEDUREMAKES ME LIKE A CHEROKEE ON THE
PAPER TRAIL OF TEARS.
NO!
(LAUGHTER)UNLESS SOMEONE THINKS THEY CAN
OUTRACE HYPERBOLIZED SENATORDURBIN.
PERHAPS YOU, REPRESENTATIVECHARLIE RANGEL?
PERHAPS YOU, REPRESENTATIVECHARLIE RANGEL?
>> THEY JUST CAN'T STAND ANOTHERBLACK AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.
THEY COME FROM STATES THATUSED TO HAVE SLAVES AND THEY'VE
ENJOYED THE CONCEPT THAT IFYOU'RE WHITE AUTOMATICALLY
YOU'RE SUPERIOR.
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.
>> Jon: THE SAME WAY I CAN'THELP MYSELF FROM SAYING VERY
DUMB THINGS!
FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S SOMETHING ISAID -- WHAT IF BEARDS GREW
FASTER IF YOU WATERED THEM? IKNOW IT'S STUPID, BUT,
(LAUGHTER)I CAN'T HELP MYSELF!
YOU KNOW, HE IS -- HERE'S MY OWNPREJUDICE, WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES,
THAT IS MY GRANDFATHER TALKING.(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT, I FEEL PRETTYCERTAIN THAT THIS RACE IS AN
ACCUSATION THAT'S KIND OF(BLEEP) BUT I'M NOT 100% SURE.
SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND USE MY"PHONE A BLACK FRIEND."
LET ME JUST TURN REAL QUICK ANDO THAT.
YEAH, HELLO, JESSICA?
>> Jessica:  HELLO?
>> Jon: HEY JESSICA, I NEEDYOUR HELP, I'VE GOT
THIRTY SECONDS.
ARE REPUBLICANS HOLDING UPLORETTA LYNCH'S CONFIRMATION
BECAUSE THEY'RE RACIST, OR AREDEMOCRATS JUST TROLLING?
>> Jessica:  IS THIS PAUL?
>> Jon:  JESSICA, THE CLOCK ISTICKING!
>> Jessica:  I'M JUST MESSINGWITH YOU, JON!
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TROLLING,DEFINITELY.
>> Jon: SEE THAT'S WHAT ITHOUGHT!
IT'S WICKEDY-WHACK, IS IT NOT?IS IT --
HELLO?
(DIAL TONE)HELLO?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: I THOUGHT SO.
FACE IT, DEMOCRATS.
REPUBLICANS HOLDING UP LYNCH'SNOMINATION ISN'T THEM BEING
RACIST, IT'S THEM BEING THEM.
>> IN THE HISTORY OF THECOUNTRY, THERE HAVE BEEN 168
FILIBUSTERS OF PRESIDENTIALNOMINEES ABOUT HALF, 82,
HAPPENED DURING THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION.
>> Jon: THEY DON'T NEED AREASON TO HOLD UP AN OBAMA
APPOINTEE!
IT'S PART OF THEIR DAILYROUTINE.
YOU WAKE UP, YOU GO TO WORK, YOUPLEDGE ALLEGIENCE
TO THE GIANT POSTER OF REAGANAND JESUS RIDING A HORSE
TOGETHER, THAT ADORNS THE WALLOF THEIR OFFICE AND SPEND THE
REST OF THE DAY BLOCKING SOMEOBAMA APPOINTEE -- I JUST,
REALLY? REAGAN IN THE FRONT? IWOULD HAVE THOUGHT,
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE SON OFGOD WOULD BE STEERING.
YES! YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE THEGUY WHO SINGLE-HANDEDLY ENDED
THE COLD WAR RIDING INTHE BACK, THOUGH.
MAYBE WE COULD DO LIKE ATWO-HEADED JESUS-REAGAN HYBRID.
YES!
TRULY HOW GOD INTENDED.
IF ANYTHING, REPUBLICANS ARETREATING LYNCH WITH THE SAME
LOW LEVEL OF RESPECT THEYCONSISTENTLY RESERVE FOR ALL OF
OBAMA'S APPOINTEES AND BYPLAYING THE RACE CARD WHEN IT'S
NOT JUSTIFIED, DEMOCRATS RISKBIG IGNORED WHEN THE RACE
CARD IS JUSTIFIED,WHICH IT IS A LOT.
IT'S LIKE WHEN REPUBLICANS TRYTO LIMIT EARLY VOTING OR IMPOSE
VOTER I.D., LAWS THEY KNOW WILLDISPROPORTIONATELY EFFECT
MINORITY VOTERS. BUT YOUDON'T WANT TO BE THE BOY WHO
CRIED WOLF ON RACISM BECAUSELET'S BE HONEST,
EVEN WHEN THE WOLF IS REAL, MOSTPEOPLE ARE NOT GIVING A (BLEEP).
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
