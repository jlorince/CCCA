FOR MORE WE GO LIVE TO JOHN
OLIVER.
HE JOINS US FROM THE GATES OF
THE FEDERAL PRISON IN MARION,
ILLINOIS.
JOHN OLIVER, TELL US A LITTLE
BIT...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I'M SORRY.
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE
PRISON WORLD TWO ROD BLAGOJEVICH
IS VERY LIKELY ENTERING INTO.
>> HAPPY TO.
JON, THE EXCITING THING FOR ROD
BLAGOJEVICH ISN'T JUST THAT
HE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY OTHER
ILLINOIS GOVERNORS, IT'S THAT
ALL THREE BRANCHES OF ILLINOIS
GOVERNMENTS ARE WELL REPRESENTED
IN THIS PRISON.
[LAUGHTER]
PRISON LAWS CAN BE MADE BY THEIR
MANY CONVICTED LEGISLATORS.
THOSE SAME LAWS INTERPRETED BY
THEIR CONVICTED JUDGES.
IT'S REALLY ABOUT CHECKS AND
BALANCES.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR,
EX-GOVERNOR SURVIVE IN PRISON?
>> SIMPLY PUT, JON, HE BETTER
GET IN GOOD WITH THE PRISON
LOBBYISTS.
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL REQUIRE
TIRELESS CIGARETTE FUND-RAISING
AND ACCESS TO THE BEST TOILET
WINES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OUT OF RANDOM
CURIOSITY, WHAT WOULD
DISTINGUISH A GOOD TOILET WINE?
>> PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT TANNINS
AND THINGS, BUT MOST
CONNOISSEURS WILL TELL YOU IT'S
ALL ABOUT THE URINE CONTENT.
YES.
JON AND LACK THEREOF I WOULD
SUPPOSE.
ABAPPALLING RECORD OF OFFICIAL
CORRUPTION IN ILLINOIS.
HOW CAN THAT STATE BREAK THE
CYCLE OF GOVERNMENT CRIMINALITY?
>> JON, IT'S ABOUT GETTING TO
THE CHILDREN OF ILLINOIS BEFORE
THEY GET LURED INTO THE MURKY
WORLD OF ELECTED OFFICE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING.
JOHN, CAN YOU HELP US OUT AND
HELP THE PARENTS AT HOME?
WHAT ARE SOME WARNING SIGNS
PARENTS CAN KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR.
>> JON, THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT
QUESTION.
PARENTS HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN
THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES TO SPOT
THE RED FLAGS.
>> Jon: AND WHAT WOULD THOSE
BE, JOHN?
SUCH AS?
>> FOR STARTERS, JON, POSTER
BOARD, MAGIC MARKERS, THAT TYPE
OF PARAFA NAIL THAT CAN BE
INDICATIVE THAT THEY HAVE
ASPIRATIONS TO RUN FOR STUDENT
COUNCIL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO EVEN STUDENT
COUNCIL IS BAD?
>> WELL, IT'S A GATEWAY OFFICE,
JON.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: JOHN, I HAVE A FRIEND.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HIM,
A TEENAGER.
HIS SON IS A TEENAGER, RECENTLY
TURNED SULLEN AND COMBATIVE, AND
HE'S QUITE SECRETIVE.
>> WELL, LUCKY HIM, JOHN, HE'S
OKAY.
A TIME TO WORRY IS WHEN YOUR
CHILD BECOMES SUSPICIOUSLY
EXTROVERTED, IF HE'S SUDDENLY
FOND OF CORNY JOKES OR LIKES TO
WALK AROUND THE DINNER TABLE
SHAKING HANDS AND ASKING, WHAT'S
GOOD HERE?
WHAT ARE WE EATING?
WHEN THE NEIGHBORS BRING A BABY
OVER, DOES HE KISS IT REPEATEDLY
ON THE CHEEK OVER AND OVER AGAIN
LOOKING FOR THE CAMERAS?
IF SO, BING, YOU HE COULD BE
LOOKING AT FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS
IN THE ILLINOIS STATEHOUSE
FOLLOWED BY 15 TO 20 YEARS IN
PRISON.
>> Jon: TERRIFYING, JOHN.
DO YOU THINK IT'S GETTING
THROUGH TO THE NEXT GENERATION?
>> WE CAN ONLY HOPE, BUT IT'S
NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING.
ALREADY THEY'RE LAUNCHING A
STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP KIDS
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN, JON, TALK
TO YOUR KIDS BEFORE IT'S TOO
LATE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
JOHN OLIVER WITH THAT
