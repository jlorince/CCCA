RECENTLY DID A SEGMENT ABOUT HIMAFTER HE MADE SOME PRESIDENT'S
DAY TALKS ABOUT THE 16thPRESIDENT.
>> I AM A CONTRAIN ON ABRAHAMLINCOLN AND BEMOAN THE FACT THAT
HE HAS BEEN MYTHOLOGIZED ATTHE TIME HE WAS PRESIDENT
SLAVERY WAS DYING A NATURALDEATH ALL OVER THE WESTERN
WORLD. IT HAD JUST BEEN EXPIREDBY LEGISLATION IN ENGLAND AND
THE SOUTHERN PLANTATION OWNERSWERE ON THE
CUSP OF IT DYING HERE. INSTEADOF ALLOWING IT TO DIE OR
HELPING IT TO DIE ORPURCHASING THE SLAVES AND THEN
FREEING THEM WHICH WOULD HAVECOST A LOT LESS MONEY THAN THE
CIVIL WAR COST, LINCOLN SETABOUT ON THE MOST MURDEROUS WAR
IN AMERICAN HISTORYJon: WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THAT PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM JUDGE ANDREW
NAPOLITANO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

OF LIBERTY -->> THANKS.
>> Jon: OF FREEDOM TO
THEN LISTEN TO YOUR COMMENTSABOUT SLAVERY SEEMS THE
ANTITHESIS, YOU SEEM TO DISCUSSIT IN COOL, RATIONAL ECONOMIC
TERMS RATHER THAN THE TERMS YOUUSE TO DESCRIBE LIBERTY.
>> MY DISCUSSION WAS ABOUTLINCOLN.
MY CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY ISSECOND TO NONE.
YOU'VE READ MY BOOK DRED SCOTT'SREVENGE.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD. I'VE READ ITTWICE.
>> READY FOR A POP QUIZ? IT'S
THE STANDARD LIBERTARIAN ASSAULTON SLAVERY WHICH WAS THE
MOST HORRIFIC, AMORAL, UNNATURALINSTITUTION IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD.
>> Jon: THEN LET ME ASK YOUTHIS
IF IT IS THE MOST AMORAL,UNNATURAL.
>> HORRIFIC.
>> Jon: THIS IDEA THAT IT WILLDIE A NATURAL DEATH SEEMS TO ME
TO BE THE ANTITHESIS OFSOMEONE WHO PRAISES THE
FOUNDERS TO WHAT YOU HAVE CALLEDTHE TYRANNY OF ENGLAND
THERE'S NOT ONE THINGON THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE THAT RISESTO THE LEVEL OF SLAVERY.
>> THE DECLARATION OFINDEPENDENCE WAS WRITTEN AND
SIGNED BY SLAVE OWNERS.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
>> IT'S THEIR MORAL DILEMMA THESAME PERSON WHO WROTE WE'REENDOWED
BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAINUNALIENABLE RIGHTS
-- THOMASJEFFERSON OWNED SLAVES.
>> Jon: BUT HOW DO YOU SQUARETHE CIRCLE? OF
PRAISING THEREVOLUTIONARY FOUNDERS GOING TO
WAR WITH LINCOLN NOT GOING TOWAR BUT STANDING BACK FOR THE
HOPE THAT THIS INSTITUTION WILLDIE A DEATH.
>> IF THE SLAVES HAD GONE TO WAR
AGAINST THEIR SLAVE OWNERS AND IHAD BEEN ALIVE, I WOULD HAVE
BEEN WITH THEM.
I WOULD HAVE HELPED FINANCE,FUND AND LEAD THAT REVOLT.
>> Jon: ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITHSLAVERY?
>> I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT.
>> Jon: THAT IS NOT THEOPTION.
>> ACTUALLY ACTUALLY -->> Jon: WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A
MINUTE.
>> NO, NO, NO.
LINCOLN TRIED TO ARM THE SLAVES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: BEAR WITH ME YOU WOULD
SUPPORT A SLAVE REBELLION ASBEING JUST.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: BUT NOT THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT.
IF THERE'S EVER ANY REAL USE OFFEDERAL POWER THAT WOULD BE
JUSTIFIED, WOULD IT NOT BE TOEND THE MOST HORRIFIC ABHORRENT
PRACTICE IN THE HISTORY OFMANKIND?
>> AFTER IT HAD TRIED EVERYTHINGELSE LIKE ABOLISHING THE
FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT WHICH LINCOLNENFORCED AND HIS JUDGES ENFORCED
AND FEDERAL MARSHALS ENFORCEDUNTIL THE CIVIL WAR WAS OVER
LINCOLN WAS NEARLYDEAD.
>> Jon: SLAVERY WAS OUTLAWEDIN WHAT 1808.
>> YES.
>> Jon: ENGLAND OUTLAWED IT IN1833.
HOW MUCH LONGER DID PEOPLE HAVETO WAIT FOR IT TO DIE A NATURAL
DEATH?
>> BRAZIL OUTLAWED IT. SWEDENOUTLAWED IT.
>> Jon: BRAZIL IN 1890.
>> NORWAY OUTLAWED IT. THENORTHERN STATES ALL OF WHICH
HAD SLAVES OUTLAWED IT. IT WASON ITS WAY OUT.
>> Jon: WHY IS THE ONUS NOT ONLINCOLN AND NOT ON THE SOUTHERN
STATES?
THEY SECEDED?
LINCOLN DID NOT SECEDE?
THEY SECEDED FROM THE UNIONBEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE AS A
MATTER OF FACT.
>> THE LEADERS OF SOUTHERNSTATES PERPETUATED THIS IMMORAL
SYSTEM.
I HAVE NO PRAISE FOR THEMWHATSOEVER.
BUT LINCOLN COULD HAVE UNDONE ITWITHOUT SPENDING $6.6 BILLION.
>> Jon: HOW?
>> AND CAUSING DEATH OF 785,000HUMAN BEINGS.
>> Jon: HOW MANY DEATHS OFHUMAN BEINGS WERE CAUSED BY THE
AMERICAN SLAVE TRADE.
>> PROBABLY A MILLION AND AHALF.
>> Jon: TRY FIVE MILLION ORMORE, NOBODY COUNTED.
>> WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THESLAVE TRADE IS TO BE CONDEMNED.
IT WAS OVER IN LINCOLN'SINFANCY.
THE SLAVE TRADE AS YOU JUSTPOINTED OUT
WAS OUTLAWED BY THETERMS OF CONSTITUTION IN 1808.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO THAT WAS -->> LINCOLN'S JOB IS TO STOP THE
SLAVE TRADE IN THE U.S. WHICH HECOULD HAVE DONE FINANCIALLY AND
LEGALLY AND HE DIDN'T.
IF A SLAVE ESCAPED FROM SOUTHCAROLINA TO MASSACHUSETTS THE
BURDEN WAS ON MASSACHUSETTS'AUTHORITIES AND INDIVIDUALS
AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE TORETURN THAT SLAVE.
>> Jon: THAT WAS ONE OFGRIEVANCES THAT THE SOUTH PUT
OUT THERE.
>> LINCOLN PUT PEOPLE IN JAILWHO REFUSED TO DO THAT
HE COULD HAVE STOPPED ENFORCINGIT.
LINCOLN COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THESOUTH FINANCIALLY AND BOUGHT THE
SLAVES THEIR FREEDOM.
>> Jon: BUYING THE SLAVESFREEDOM I THINK IS NOT AS TRUE
AS YOU MIGHT BELIEVE.
HE TRIED TO DO IT IN THE BORDERSTATES.
HE OFFERED THEM MONEY FOR THEIRSLAVES IN THE BORDER STATES.
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT HAD NOTEVEN SECEDED YET AND THEY
REFUSED.
>> THEY DIDN'T SECEDE UNTILLINCOLN STARTED KILLING PEOPLE.
BECAUSE IN THE BORDER STATES --
>> Jon: HE STARTED KILLINGPEOPLE BECAUSE THE SOUTH -- WHY
IS THE ONUS ON LINCOLN?
>> BECAUSE HE FIRED THE SHOTS.
NOT THE FIRST SHOT.
HE TRICKED SOUTH CAROLINA TOFIRING THE FIRST SHOT.
>> Jon: SO LINCOLN TRICKEDSOUTH CAROLINA --
[LAUGHTER]-- YOUR VISION OF THE CIVIL WAR
IS LINCOLN PULLED A FAST ONE --[LAUGHTER]
-- ON THE SOUTH.
>> YES.
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT AS WELL.
>> Jon: I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]I DO NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO
BELIEVING THAT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: JUDGE NAPOLITANO'S
BOOK "THEODORE AND WOODROW" ISON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO TEST YOURKNOWLEDGE.
>> DO I HAVE TO STAY?>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE--
>> I KNOW WHAT ISCOMING.
>> Jon: IT'S FUN.
>> THEY ARE GREAT GUYS.
>> Jon: JUDGE ANDREWNAPOLITANO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
