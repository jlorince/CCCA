MEANWHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA, FINDSHIMSELF IN BEIJING FOR APEC,
THE ASIA-PACIFICECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY DRYECONOMIC CONFERENCE DEDICATED TO
PROMOTING GLOBAL PROSPERITYTHROUGH THE -- WHAT THE, WHO
THE -- WAIT. WHO BREAKS OUTJOSEPH AND THE TECHNICOLOR
DRUMMER CORPS FOR AN ECONOMICSUMMIT?
WHAT? FIREWORKS! WHAT THE --
FIREWORKS THAT SPELL OUT APEC,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, CHINA DOESTHE WHOLE FIREWORKS THING FOR
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.
THE JUST, THEY LOVE A GOODFIREWORKS. YOU KNOW,
THE SAD THING IS, I DON'T KNOWIF YOU KNOW THIS, PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S HE'S BEEN PRETTY BUMMEDOUT ABOUT HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES
HERE AT HOME. I DON'T KNOW IFHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET
INTO THE SPIRIT OF--WHAT THE (BLEEP) IS HE WEARING?!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HE DIDN'T DRESS FOR A SUMMIT, HE
DRESSED FOR THE HUNGER GAMES.
(LAUGHTER)WHY IS HE DRESSED LIKE THAT?
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, BYTRADITION, THIS IS INTERESTING,
THE HOST COUNTRY OFECONOMIC SUMMITS USUALLY CHOOSES
A FANCIFUL OUTFIT FOR ALL THEWORLD LEADERS TO WEAR.
IT'S WHY I'M GLAD THEY'RE NOTHOLDING THEM IN FRANCE AGAIN,
BECAUSE THAT -- YOU LIKE THAT?PUTIN?
(LAUGHTER)(PURRING)
PUTIN.
SO OTHER THAN COSPLAY, WHAT'S ONTHE AGENDA AT APEC?
>> CLIMATE CHANGE IS ON THEAGENDA, AND A CHINESE GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL SAID GOOD AIR QUALITYIS THE "PRIORITY OF PRIORITIES."
>> Jon: WELL, THEY THINK.THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THEOFFICIAL SAY THAT
THROUGH THE CURTAIN OFSOUND-DAMPENING SMOG THAT PASSES
FOR AIR IN BEIJING. I MEAN,HOW ARE THEY EVEN GOING TO MAKE
IT BREATHABLE FOR THE SUMMIT?
>> TO REDUCE POLLUTION BY ABOUTA THIRD, GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN CLOSED ANDFACTORIES SHUT DOWN.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, ITTAKES ME BACK, I'LL NEVER
FORGET, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP INCHINA, WE USED TO SIT AROUND
THE RADIO LISTENING INTHE MORNING HOPING WE
WOULD GET OUT OF SCHOOLFOR AN AIR DAY.
WELL, DID IT WORK?
>> THE SKIES HAVE BEEN DUBBEDAPEC BLUE BY RESIDENTS.
>> Jon: WELL, AT LEAST THERESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T FLEE IN
FEAR AT THE ENORMOUS SKY FIREBALL. WHAT IS THIS?
SAVE US MOTHER SMOG, IT BURNS!
HAVE THEY EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT HOWMAD THE PEOPLE OF BEIJING ARE
GOING TO GET AFTER THE SUMMITWHEN THEIR AIR GOES BACK TO
ABNORMAL?
>> AN EDITORIAL IN THESTATE-LINKED "CHINADAILY" SAID
BEIJING RESIDENTS "WILL NO DOUBTFEEL UNEASY WHEN THE CITY IS
ONCE AGAIN SMOTHERED IN SMOGAFTER THE APEC MEETING BUT THEY
WILL GET USED TO IT AS THEY DIDBEFORE."
>> Jon: THAT MAY BE THE WORSTCITY SLOGAN EVER!
WELCOME TO BEIJING -- YOU WILLGET USED TO IT -- AS YOU DID
BEFORE.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, THE
REAL ACTION WAS INSIDE THESUMMIT, ALL EYES WERE ON
THE LEADERS OF TWO OF THEWORLD'S SUPERPOWERS.
>> PRESIDENT PUTIN WENT UP TOPRESIDENT OBAMA IN THIS VERY
ORNATE ROOM .
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SORT OFAVERTED HIS GAZE AND AVOIDED EYE
CONTACT AS IF, NOT AGAIN, IDON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO TALK
TO YOU.
>> Jon: DON'T MAKE IT SOUNDLIKE THEY'RE MEAN GIRLS!
(LAUGHTER)AND OBAMA IS SHADING PUTIN
BECAUSE PUTIN MADE OUT WITHBRANDON WHEN HE KNEW OBAMA LIKED
BRANDON. I MEAN, ALITTLE STINK EYE FOR THE GUY
WHO IS ARMING ASSAD AND INVADINGTHE UKRAINE
IS NOT NECESSARILYINAPPROPRIATE, ALTHOUGH THE
BRANDON THING STINGS,I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, IT STINGS.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OBAMA AND
PUTIN IS FROSTY, CHECKOUT JAPAN AND CHINA
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
>> AN AWKWARD HANDSHAKE BETWEENCHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING AND
JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZOABE.
IT'S THEIR FIRST FACE-TO-FACETALKS SINCE EITHER LEADER TOOK
OFFICE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
I WOULD RATHER BE HOLDING MY OWNSEVERED PENIS THAN YOUR HAND
RIGHT NOW. WELL, REST ASSURED, IAM THINKING OF A SEVERED PENIS
JUST TO GET THROUGH HOLDING YOURHAND.
ANYWAY, I HOPEWE CAN WORK THINGS OUT.
(LAUGHTER)STILL, YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT
TO PUTIN, THOUGH. OBAMA DOESN'TWANT TO TALK TO HIM, BUT HE'S
STILL OUT THERE TRYING TO MAKEFRIENDS.
>> RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIRPUTIN RAISING SOME EYEBROWS OF
HIS OWN.
FOR THE RECENTLY DIVORCEDVLADIMIR PUTIN WAS GETTING A
LITTLE TOO FRIENDLY WITH THECHINESE FIRST LADY.
HE GALLANTLY WRAPPED A COATAROUND HER SHOULDERS AT AN APEC
EVENT.
A LITTLE BIT TOO GALLANT, IGUESS.
SHE SMILED POLITELY ANDTHEN MOMENTS LATER SLIPPED THE
COAT OFF.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, SHE THOUGHTPUTIN JUST ANNEXED THE CHINESE
PRESIDENT'S WIFE! THE GUY'S ANANNEXING MACHINE!
OF COURSE, OUR PRESIDENT DID NOTESCAPE THE WRATH OF CHINA.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ARRIVING AT ADINNER AT THE APEC SUMMIT IN
BEIJING CHEWING SOME GUM!
>> WELL CHINESE BLOGGERS, AS YOUMIGHT EXPECT, WENT BALLISTIC.
>> Jon: YEAH, CHINESE BLOGGERSWHEN BALLISTIC.
WAIT A MINUTE, YOURBLOGGERS GINNED UP OUTRAGE OVER
SOMETHING TRIVIAL?
MAYBE OUR COUNTRIES AREN'T SODIFFERENT AFTER ALL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
