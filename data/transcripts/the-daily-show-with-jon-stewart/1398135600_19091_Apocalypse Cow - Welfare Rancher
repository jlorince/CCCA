THAT LAND IS GOING TO STAYVACANT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR
CATTLE ARE ON IT OR NOT, RIGHT? WHEN YOUR CATTLE GRAZE THERE,
THAT KEEPS THE PRICE OF MEATDOWN FOR EVERY AMERICAN
CONSUMER.
>> YES, MOST GOODS ARE CHEAPERWHEN YOU STEAL THE RAW MATERIALS
NECESSARY TO MAKETHEM. IN FACT HAVE YOU SEEN THE
PRICES AT FELL OFFA TRUCK MART? SO APPARENTLY SEAN
HANNITY THINKS LAWS ARE SERVEDBUFFET STYLE, IN THAT YOU CAN
PICK AND CHOOSE THE ONES THATYOU LIKE BEST, THE ONES
YOU DON'T LIKE, YOUDON'T HAVE TO ABIDE.
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO SIT WELLWITH FOX NEWS' IMMIGRATION SLASH

EVERYBODY SHOULD OBEY THELAW? TELL ME HOW THE PRESIDENT
CAN UNILATERALLY PICK AND CHOOSEWHICH PART OF THE LAW HE WILL
UPHOLD AT WHATEVER TIME HECHOOSES.
>> Jon: I MEAN, THE GUY IS NOTEVEN WEARING A COWBOY HAT.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T GET TOCHOOSE.
>> APPARENTLY HE SELECTS COWBOYHATS WHICH LAWS YOU WILL OBEY
LIKE SOME SORT OF LEGAL SORTINGHAT.
>> BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE WORSTHARRY POTTER EVER.
>> OR MAYBE SEAN JUST RESPECTSPEOPLE WHO FIGHT FOR THEIR
PRINCIPLES, EVEN AFTER THEY LOSETHEIR CASE IN COURT.
>> A GROUP OF ATHEISTS LOSTTHEIR BATTLE WITH THE STATE OF
UTAH OVER 14 STEEL CROSS HIGHWAYMEMORIALS, AND THE JUDGE'S
RULING, YOU GUYS LOST.
>> THAT WILL BE OVERTURNED.
>> NO, YOU LOST.
>> Jon: AH.
I GUESS UNLESS YOUR FRIENDS AREARMED AND READY TO HAVE YOUR

[LAUGHTER.]>> Jon: NOW, I KNOW YOU DON'T
LIKE PEOPLE SCAMMING OFF THETAXPAYERS, SEAN.
>> MY NEXT GUEST IS A CALIFORNIASURFER, HE LIVES ON FOOD STAMPS,
I WANT YOU TO REALIZE YOU ARETAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AND
YOU ARE LIVING A SELFISH LIFE.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL --[LAUGHTER.]
>> Jon: -- THERE IS NO WAYTHAT'S (BLEEP) THAT GUY'S HAIR.
THERE'S NO WAY. THAT IS YOUNGHAIR BUT UNDERNEATH THOSE
GLASSES IS AN OLD FACE. AND IT'STOO BAD SURFER DUDE ISN'T A COW,
OTHERWISE HANNITY WOULD BEFINE WITH THE GOVERNENT PAYING
FOR HIS MEALS.
>> ALSO IT WOULD BE COOL TO SEEA SURFING COW.
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING ABOUTTHIS BUNDY FELLER IS BLINDING
HANNITY TO ALL THE THINGS THATWOULD NORMALLY DRIVE HANNITY MAD
WITH RAGE. IS IT THE HAT?BECAUSE WE CAN GIVE HIM A
DIFFERENT HAT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? AND YOU KNOWWHAT, GIVE HIM A DIFFERENT
HAIRSTYLE. AND A NEW SHIRT.
AND A PAIR OF DEVIL STICKS.
>> OH, NO, HE IS AN OCCUPY WALLSTREET PROTESTER.
>> TRESPASSING ON LAND THATDOESN'T BELONG TO HIM, GET 'EM,
SEAN!
>> YOU ARE PROTESTER OF THE DAYAND YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT AND
TAKE A SHOWER.
>> TAKE OVER A PARK AND SLEEP ONTHE STREET.
>> Jon: NOW THAT IS THE WAYYOU TALK TO A TRESPASSER WHO
VOTES DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU.
HOW OUT THERE IS HANNITY ON THISISSUE?
>> I HAVE CATTLE.
AND I HAVE PEOPLE THAT GRAZE ONMY LAND, GRAZING FEES ARE
NORMAL, AND YOU STOPPED PAYINGTHEM.
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WOULDSAY THAT YOU ARE, LET ME QUOTE A
WELFARE RANCHER.
>> Jon: SEAN HANNITY HAS NOWMADE GLENN BECK THE VOICE OF
REASON.
[LAUGHTER.][ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: IF YOU WANT, IF YOUWANT TO CHALLENGE THE AMOUNT OF
FEDERAL LAND THE GOVERNMENT OWNSIN THE STATE OF NEVADA, FINE,
MAKE YOUR CASE TO THE VOTERS, IFYOU WANT TO CHALLENGE THE
CONCEPT OF GRAZING FEES, FINEBUT HANNITY'S PUFFERY AND ARMED
FRIENDS DON'T MAKE YOU APATRIOT.
>> I GUESS MAYBE I'M A LITTLEBIT LIKE THE FOUNDINGFATHERS.
>> Jon: DUDE, YOU'RE A WELFARERANCHER TRYING TO PULL OFF
THE LARGEST CATTLE DINE ANDDASH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
