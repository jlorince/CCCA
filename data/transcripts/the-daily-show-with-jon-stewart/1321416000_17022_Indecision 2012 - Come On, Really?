(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW", MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, MY
GUEST... WE ARE EXCITED TONIGHT.
MY GUEST, ASTRONAUT-- YOU HEARD
ME CORRECTLY-- ASTRONAUT AND
AUTHOR MARK KELLY.
DID YOU KNOW, WHEN MARK KELRY
WAS A LITTLE BOY HE DREAMED OF
GROWING UP TO BE A REGIONAL
COPPER WIRING DISTRIBUTOR.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT HE WAS A FAILURE!
(LAUGHTER)
AND ENDED UP HAVING TO AS ROE
NAUGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK THAT'S A VERB FOR BEING
A ASTRONAUT.
I'M NOT SURE.
ANYWAY, JUST TWO AND A HALF
WEEKS AGO WE FOUND OUT
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE HERMAN CAIN HAD SEXUAL
HARASSMENT ISSUES WHEN THE
NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION
SETTLED SOME LAWSUITS FOR HIM
SETTING OFF A MEDIA FIRESTORM
WHICH LASTED UNTIL SIX DAYS AGO
WHEN REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE RICK PERRY FIRED THE
BRAIN FART HEARD ROUND THE
WORLD.
(LAUGHTER)
ALSO SETTING OFF A MEDIA
FIRESTORM.
BUT, AGAIN, THAT'S SIX DAYS AGO!
DADDY NEED ANOTHER HIT OF GAS
BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THE RACE TO
DETERMINE THE MOST QUALIFIED
OPPONENT TO CHALLENGE THE
CURRENT LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD
IN THE NOVEMBER 2012 GENERAL
ELECTION IS BORING ME!
ANYONE?
>> IS THIS A RICK PERRY "OOPS"
MOMENT FOR HERMAN CAIN?
(LAUGHTER)
GO ON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HERMAN CAIN CAUGHT ON CAMERA
WITH AN INCREDIBLY AWKWARD AND
RAMBLING EXPLANATION FOR HIS
POSITION ON LIBYA.
>> I CALL IT HIS DAZED AND
CONFUSED MOMENT.
>> THE CAIN TRAIN.
I TELL YOU WHAT, IT GOES OFF THE
TRACKS.
>> ANOTHER VERY AWKWARD MOMENT.
>> FINAL STRAW, MAYBE, FOR A
SINKING CAMPAIGN?
>> SERIOUS BRAIN FREEZE.
>> THAT WHOLE TAPE WAS SORT OF
LIKE A CAR CRASH.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: YOU'RE EXAGGERATING!
THERE'S NO WAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO
SHOW PEOPLE WILL LIVE UP IN MY
TRY THE HYPERBOLIC GLEE THAT WE
ARE ALL DISPLAYING.
ROLL THE TAPE.
>> SO YOU AGREE WITH PRESIDENT
OBAMA ON LIBYA OR NOT?
>> OKAY, LIBYA.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WOW!
WOW!
HOLY (BLEEP).
IT'S LIKE HE'S TRYING TO DOWN
LEAD TO ANSWER BUT...
(LAUGHTER).
IT'S STWHRAWS LITTLE BALL IS
SPINNING, HE'S JUST BUFFERING!
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SUPPORTED THE
UPRISING, CORRECT?
PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED FOR THE
REMOVAL OF QADDAFI.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING
BEFORE I SAY YES I AGREE OR NO I
DIDN'T AGREE.
>> Jon: I JUST WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING HERE.
THIS IS NOT A SPELLING BE WHERE
YOU CAN JUST ASK THE MODERATOR
FOR THE LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN TO
BUY YOURSELF SOME TIME.
"COULD YOU USE THAT IN A
SENTENCE?"
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE "MOST CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICAN VOTERS FEEL PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S HANDLING OF LIBYA WAS--"
(LAUGHTER)
BLANK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M SURE HE WAS GETTING AROUND
TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION AT
HAND.
>> I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE WAY
HE HANDLED IT FOR THE FOLLOWING
REASONS: UM... NO, THAT'S A
DIFFERENT ONE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: (WHISPERING)
I AM FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S A DIFFERENT ONE?
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT REASON... WHAT IS CAIN
GOING THROUGH IN HIS MENTAL
ROLODEX.
NO, THAT'S MY POLICY REGARDING A
WOMAN NAMED LYDIA.
ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
THIS IS... NO, THAT'S MY
POSITION ON THE LOCATION OF THE
LABIA.
THAT'S NOT IT.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, THAT'S THE FUNNY COMEDIAN
FROM THE MOVIE "HEY LADY!"
COME ON, CAIN.
YOU'RE FORGETTING THE CARDINAL
RULE: IF YOU STUDY HIGH YOU HAVE
TO BE HIGH WHEN YOU TAKE THE
TEST!
(LAUGHTER)
PULL IT TOGETHER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I'VE GOT TO GO BACK.
I'VE GOT ALL THIS STUFF TWIRLING
AROUND IN MY HEAD.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: NO, I FEEL FOR YOU,
YOU KNOW?
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TWIRLING
AROUND IN MY HEAD AS WELL.
DIFFICULT BUT YOU KNOW BEING
PRESIDENT'S A REAL NONSTOP HEAD
STUFF TWIRL FEST.
(LAUGHTER)
IF I MAY QUOTE ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
(LAUGHTER)
EVENTUALLY, THOUGH, ONCE THE
STUFF STOPS TWIRLING, HERMAN
CAIN DID COME UP WITH AN ANSWER.
>> I WOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER
JOB OF DETERMINING WHO THE
OPPOSITION IS.
AND I'M SURE THAT OUR
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE HAD THAT...
HAD SOME OF THAT INFORMATION.
BASED UPON WHO MADE UP THAT
OPPOSITION, OKAY, BASED UPON WHO
MADE UP THAT OPPOSITION, MIGHT
HAVE CAUSED ME TO MAKE SOME
DIFFERENT DECISIONS ANT HOW WE
PARTICIPATED.
>> Jon: I SEE.
SO YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
THING OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST IGNORE THE
QUESTION, SHAKE YOUR HEAD AND GO
"999?
".
>> Reporter: MR. CAIN, DO YOU
THINK THE LIBYA COMMENTS
REENFORCE...
>> LET US GO THROUGH.
>> Reporter: DHASH YOU DON'T
HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF
FOREIGN POLICY?
>> 999.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
