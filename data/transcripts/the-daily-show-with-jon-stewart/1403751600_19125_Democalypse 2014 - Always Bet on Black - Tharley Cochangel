OF COURSE, IN MISSISSIPPI'SREPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY, BEING
DOMINICAN, LESS OF AN ISSUE.
THERE VOTERS HAD TO CONSIDER THEHARD CHOICE OF WHETHER
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN THADCOCHRAN OR TEA PARTY CHALLENGER
CHRIS McDANIEL WERE BETTERSUITED TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND
REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH THEPRESIDENT.

NOT AS IMPORTANT AS PEOPLE WOULDLIKE YOU TO BELIEVE.
