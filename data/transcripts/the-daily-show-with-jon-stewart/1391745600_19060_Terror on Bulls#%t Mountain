>> SO THE THREE MAIN TALKINGPOINTS  AGAINST OBAMACARE,ACCORDING TO
THE CBO NOT TRUE.  I THINK WE KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.
♪♪
THE STORM CLOUDS GATHERED QUICKLY THAT DAY ON THE
MOUNTAIN.  AS WORD SPREAD THAT THIS NEW
OBAMACARE ACT WOULD HELP END JOB, A SCOURGE AFFECTING MANY
FAMILIES WHO DON'T TAKE ENTREPRENEURIAL CHANCES OR STAY
IN DEAD END JOBS SO THE TUMOR ONTHEIR ARSE DOESN'T LEAVE THEM
HOMELESS.  IN FACT, JOB LOCK IS SOMETHING
THE RESIDENTS OF BULL[BLEEP]MOUNTAIN USED TO OPPOSE.
>> THE KEY QUESTION THAT OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSED IN ANY HEALTH
CARE REFORM LEGISLATION IS ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE JOB LOCK OR
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS MORE CHOICE AND
PORTABILITY TO FIT THE 21st CENTURY WORK FORCE?
>> GEE, MORE CHOICE, SEEMS PRETTY GOOD.
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THAT STATEMENT?
NOW THAT WE FIND OUT THE NEW HEALTH CARE LAW DOES JUST THAT.
>> BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES, AS THE WELFARE STATE
EXPANDS, THE INCENTIVE TO WORK DECLINES.
>> ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZES INDIFFERENCE.
>> NOW IT'S FREE MEDICAL CARE THROWN AT EXTRA MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INCENTIVE TOGO  ON THAT AND NOT WORK.
>> THE GOVERNMENT IS EFFECTIVELYINCENTIVIZING AMERICANS TO STOP
WORKING.
>> YOU KNOW, LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY INCENTIVIZES AMERICANS
TO NOT DIE AT THEIR JOBS.
>> NICE TO SEE A NEW TALKINGPOINT.
IF GIVING PEOPLE HEALTH CARE ISALL IT  TAKES TO GET PEOPLE TOSTOP
SHOWING UP TO WORK, I DON'T KNOWWHY WE DON'T CHIP IN AND GET
LOU DOBBS SOME HEALTH CARE.
