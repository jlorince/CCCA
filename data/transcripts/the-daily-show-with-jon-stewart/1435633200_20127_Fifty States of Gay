LEGAL DIGNITY THAT HAD BEENDENIED THEM SO MANY YEARS.

HISTORY.

AND COMMITTED SAME-SEXCOUPLES CAN FORM LIFELONG
SOCCIETY-STABILIZING, LIFE-LONGLEGALIZEED BONDS, TRULY
VOLDEMORT HAS RISEN AND THELIVING WILL ENVY THE DEAD --
WHAT IS YOUR WORLDVIEW.
OF COURSE WE NEED NOT TAKESERIOUSLY THE HYPERBOLIC
APOCALYPTIC RANTINGS OF ASITTING UNITED STATES
SENATOR.
LUCKILY FOR SENATOR CRUZ, THEREWERE OTHER SURVIVORS
OF GOOD NEWS-MAGEDDON.
>> IT WAS A HUGE LOSS FORDEMOCRACY.
>> THEY ESSENTIALLY TURNEDTHE U.S. CONSTITUTION ITS HEAD
AND I BELIEVE PUT A NAIL INTHE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
>> THERE WILL BE AN EFFORTTO FORCE PEOPLE TO CONFORM.
>> THIS IS REDEFINING AFUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTION.
>> SUPPOSE THREE PEOPLE SAYWE WANT TO BE A MARRIAGE.
WE'RE THREE PEOPLE, AND WELOVE EACH OTHER AND WE WANT
TO BE MARRIAGE.
WHAT'S TO PREVENT THAT UNDERTHIS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BECAUSE AREN'T BORNPOLYGAMISTS.
YOU KNOW, I KNEW EVEN WHEN IWAS FIVE I WAS DIFFERENT.
WILE THE OTHER BOYS PLAYEDWITH TRUCKS AND ARMY MEN, I
WAS FIGURING OUT BED SHARINGSCHEDULES WITH MULTIPLE WIVES.
(LAUGHTER)
NOT THAT THERE AREN'TREAL VICTIMS HERE.
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO A FLORISTWHO DOESN'T WANT TO PROVIDE
FLOWERS TO A GAY WEDDING.
>> ARE THEY GOING TO BE FORCEDEITHER OUT OF BUSINESS LIKE
THE FLORIST, THE CATERERS.
>> THE EVANGELICAL FLORISTSAND BAKERS AROUND THE
COUNTRY WHO ARE COERCED -- WHERE DOES IT STOP?
>> Jon: ENOUGH!
I'M SO TIRED OF THIS OLD TROPE,THIS OLD STEREOTYPE ABOUT
ANTI-GAY FLORISTS.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S ALL WE EVER HEAR ABOUT,ANTI-GAY FLORISTS.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,ARE SOME FLORISTS ANTI-GAY,
OF COURSE, THERE'S TRUTH INEVERY STEREOTYPE.
JUST LIKE SOME SCOTTSMAN ARESTINGY AND SOME FRENCHMAN
WEAR STRIPED SHIRTS ANDCARRY AROUND LONG BREADS.
BUT NOT-- NOT ALL FLORISTSHATE GAY PEOPLE.
AND IT'S TIME WE ACCEPTTHAT.
THE REALLY ARE WEIRD PART OFTHE CONSERVATIVE REACTION IS
WHEN IT STOPS BEING BEINGWITH THE COURT MAKING THIS
DECISION AND STARTSCRITICIZING THE IDEA OF THE
COURT MAKING ANY DECISION.
>> RICK SANTORUM SAID, TODAYFIVE UNELECTED JUDGES
REDEFINED THE FOUNDATIONALUNIT OF SOCIETY.
>> AND WHAT A CRAZY SYSTEMTO HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT
ISSUES OF OUR DAY DECIDED BYUNELECTED LAWYERS.
>> FIVE UNELECTEDBLACK-ROBED LAWYERS RULE.
THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THATOUR FOUNDING FATHERS CREATED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THEN WHY DID THEY PUTTHAT ARTICLE IN THE
CONSTITUTION?
SO WHY WOULD--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THIS IS THESTUPIDEST-- THE FOUNDING
FATHERS COME UP WITH THISUNBELIEVABLE IDEA FOR A
COUNTRY, RIGHT, AND SOMEJACK ASS THROWS IN SOMETHING
ABOUT PRO EQUAL BRANCH OFGOVERNMENTS POSSESSES
JUDICIAL REVIEW OVER THELEGISLATION AND THE FOUNDING
FATHERS COME IN THE NEXT DAY,WHO THE [BLEEP] PUT THIS IN
HERE?
WHAT IS THIS?
I TOLD YOU WE HAD ARTICLE 1,2, AND 4, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
3 IS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
I DIDN'T WRITE THAT!
WHAT IS WRONG --
EVEN SOME ON THE SUPREMECOURT SEEM SHOCKED THAT
THERE IS A SUPREME COURT.
>> JOHN ROBERTS, QUOTE, THEMAJORITY'S DECISION IS AN
AGO OF WILL, NOT LEGALJUDGEMENT.
THE RIGHT IT ANNOUNCES HASNO BASIS IN THE CONSTITUTION
OR THIS COURT'S PRECEDENT,ADDING, JUST WHO DO WE THINK
WE ARE.
>> Jon: PERHAPS IT'S TIME WEGO BACK TO WHEN A SUPREME
COURT WAS JUST A COURT WITHEXTRA SOUR CREAM.
DID YOU KNOW THAT THAT WASTHE ORIGINAL COURT?
THE ORIGINAL SUPREME COURT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THE ORIGINAL SUPREMECOURT WAS A COURT WITH EXTRA
SOUR CREAM.
I AM A GOOD HISTORY TEACHER.
AND OF COURSE, JUSTICE ALITO HADTO GET IN HIS ARGUMENTS
AGAINST THE PROGRESS OFHUMANKIND.
>> HERE IS WHAT SKRUS 'TISALITO SAID IN HIS DISSENT.
I ASSUME THAT THOSE WHOCLING TO OLD BELIEFS WILL BE
ABLE TO WHISPER THEIRTHOUGHTS IN THE RESCESSES OF
THEIR HOMES BUT IF THEYREPEAT THOSE VIEWS IN PUBLIC,
THEY WILL RISK BEING LABELEDAS BIGOTS AND TREATED AS
SUCH BY GOVERNMENTS,EMPLOYERS AND SCHOOLS.
>> Jon: RIGHT, OH, YOU MEANTHAT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.
(LAUGHTER)
NOT FOR NOTHING, I'D STILLLIKE TO BE ABLE TO CALL LADY
SUGAR TITS WITHOUT PEOPLEGOING, YOU KNOW --
HEY, SLOW DOWN THERE UNCLECREEPY, THAT'S YOUR
CARDIOLOGIST. I MEAN, YOU KNOW--WHY CAN'T WE JUST CONTINUE
DISLIKING AND SHUNNING THEPEOPLE WE'VE ALWAYS DISLIKED
AND SHUNNED.
EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS OKAYWITH IT, BUT THEM.
LOOK, JUSTICES, SENATOR.
YOUR PROBLEM ISN'T JUDICIALACTIVIST OR OVERREACH OR
POLITICALLY CORRECT POLICING.
YOUR PROBLEM HERE ISBALD-FACED OUT IN THE OPEN
COMMON SENSE EXPERIENCE.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO WIN THE MARRIAGE EQUALITY
FIGHT, THIS.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT SAME-SEXMARRIAGE.
>> I'M TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
>> BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO ALESBIAN WHO IS MARRIED OR A
GAY MAN WHO IS MARRIED WHOSAYS, DONALD TRUMP, WHAT IS
TRADITIONAL ABOUT BEINGMARRIED THREE TIMES.
>> WELL, I THEY HAVE A VERYGOOD POINT.
>> Jon: YES, THEY DO.
THAT IS THE POINT.
YOU'RE TO THE GOING TO WINTHE MARRIAGE EQUALITY FIGHT
BECAUSE EVEN A MAN PATHLOGICALLYDISPOSED TO NOT UNDERSTANDING
OTHER PEOPLE'S POINTS OF VIEW,UNLESS IT'S ALSO LABELED TRUMP,
EVEN HE GETS IT.
NOT THAT HE DOESN'T TRY TOSET ASIDE WHAT WENT WRONG
WITH TRADITION IN HISPARTICULAR CASE.
>> BUT YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEENA VERY HARDWORKING PERSON.
MY TWO WIFE APPROXIMATESVERY GOOD.
AND I DON'T BLAME THEM.
>> I BLAME MYSELF BECAUSE MYBUSINESS WAS SO POWERFUL FOR
ME.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT I'MTELLING YOU.
I AM FOR TRADITIONALMARRIAGE BUT TO BE FAIR, THE
TRUMP BUSINESS IS HOTTERTHAN ANY WIFE COULD POSSIBLY
BE.
(LAUGHTER)
WOULDN'T YOU [BLEEP] ONE OF MYGOLF COURSES.
I THINK YOU WOULD.
ALL 18 HOLES.
YOU'D COME BACK FOR MORE.
THAT'S A BIRDIE, OH.
BE RIGHT BACK.
