( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: EVERYBODY, THAT'S OUR SHOW.
LISTEN TO THIS.
ON THE WEB PART OF MY INTERVIEW WITH J.O., WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RED AND BLUE STATES AND WHEN THAT FIRST STARTED.
I WAS LIKE I THINK IT USED TO BE THAT THE BLUE STATES WERE CONSERVATIVE AND THE RED LIBERAL.
WE WENT ON THE INTERNET.
IT SAYS 2000 TIM RUSSERT DID IT AND IT STUCK.
IT WENT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL 2000.
GOD BLESS THE INTERNET BECAUSE WITHOUT IT WE'D BE WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS.
JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00.
HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN
>> HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I FORGET.
I LOOKED AT MY CERTIFICATE RECENTLY AND I SAID WHY LESS A LITTLE THING LIKE THIS BOTHER ME?
IT HAPPENED SO LONG
