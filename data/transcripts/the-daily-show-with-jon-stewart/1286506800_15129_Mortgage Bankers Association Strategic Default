[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS YOU JUST LEARNED COUNTLESS
HOMEOWNERS HAVE SUFFERED AT THE
HANDS OF UNSCIEWP HRUS BANKS.
HAVE WE LOST SIGHT OF REAL
VICTIMS IN THE FORECLOSURE
CRISIS?
WYATTWYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
>> THERE'S A DANGEROUS NEW TREND
IN AMERICAN REAL ESTATE,
STRATEGIC DEFAULT.
HOMEOWNERS ARE WALKING AWAY FROM
THEIR MORTGAGES EVEN WHEN THEY
COULD AFFORD TO PAY.
THIS PRACTICE WORRIES PRESIDENT
OF MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION.
>> WHAT DOES THAT DO TO OTHER
PROPERTIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IS?
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DIRE.
>> IT'S A MORE YAM IMPERATIVE TO
KEEP YOUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT LIVING A
GOOD AND VIRTUOUS FINANCIAL
LIFE, I WENT TO THE MBA
HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
I'M THERE TO SEAT MORTGAGE
BANKERS ASSOCIATION.
>> THEY ARE NO LONGER IN THE
BUILDING.
>> WHAT THEY ARE NO LONGER HERE?
THEY PURR -- PURCHASED THIS $79
MILLION BUILDING THREE YEARS
AGO.
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
THE ASSOCIATION WALKED AWAY FROM
ITS HEADQUARTERS BUILDING WHEN
IT WENT UNDER WATER ON THE
MORTGAGE.
>> WOW, SO THEY STRATEGICALLY
DEFAULTED THEN OUR LOAN.
SINCE THEY ONLY PUT DOWN 5% THE
BLAME SHOULD FALL ON THE IDIOT
BANKERS THAT GAVE THEM THE MONEY
I CAUGHT UP WITH THE HEAD OF THE
BANKERS ASSOCIATION JOHN COPE
LAND.
IF I GET THE HOUSE HOW LONG
SHOULD I WAIT BEFORE I DEFAULT
ON IT?
>> YOU ARE GOING TO NEVER
DEFAULT.
>> THE MORTGAGE BANKERS
ASSOCIATION DEFAULTED ON THEIR
$79 MILLION HEADQUARTERS IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
>> CORRECT.
>> IF THEY DID IT, WHY CAN'T I?
>> FOR THE ASSOCIATION TO
DEFAULT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> AS PART OF THE MBA FAMILY HOW
DOES IT FEEL KNOWING YOUR DADDY
COULDN'T PAY HIS MORTGAGE?
>> KNOWING DADDY COULDN'T PAY
HIS MORTGAGE, WE'RE SYMPATHETIC.
THAT'S ALL WE CAN BE.
>> SUCKS TO FIND OUT YOUR DAD
SAY DEADBEAT.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
>> ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT
HUMILIATION HE FELT WALKING AWAY
FROM HIS PROPERTY AFTER PUBLICLY
SHAEUPLG HOMEOWNERS WHO DO THE
SAME.
>> WHERE IS THE MBA LIVING
SNOWNCH WHERE IS THE MBA AT?
>> YEAH.
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.
>> THEY ARE JUST OUT THERE ON
THE STREETS?
>> I THINK WE'RE NOT REALLY ON
THE STREET CORNER.
>> ARE THEY SAYING AT THE Y?
I HOPE THEY ARE NOT TURNING
TRICKS.
>> I WOULD THINK NOT.
I THINK WE'RE MAKING ENDS MEET
THE BEST WE CAN.
>> TURNS OUT LIKE MANY PEOPLE
THE MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION
DECIDED IT'S A BETTER TIME TO
RENT AND FOUND A NEW PLACE JUST
FIVE BLOCKS UP THE STREET FROM
THEIR OLD $79 MILLION
HEADQUARTERS.
>> I'M HERE TO TALK TO THE
MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION.
>> OKAY.
I'LL CALL UPSTAIRS.
>> SURE.
SO I WAITED BUT THEY NEVER CAME
DOWN.
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE IN
DALLAS, TEXAS, AT THE GAYLORD
HOTEL.
THEY SCRAPED TOGETHER THE MONEY
THEY SAVED NOT MAKING MORTGAGE
PAYMENTS TO HOST A CONFERENCE.
THEY WERE TRYING TO LIFT THEIR
MEMBERS SPIRITS WITH THE HOTEL'S
VINE VINEYARD, GIANT TRAIN SET
AND BY PUTTING ON WORKSHOPS LIKE
MAKING PEACE WITH PROPERTY
VALUES AND THE ETHICAL MORTGAGE
BANKERS.
CLEARLY THEY NEEDED MY HELP.
I WAS HERE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.
I HEARD THE TERRIBLE NEWS.
TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE THAT YOU
DEFAULTED ON YOUR HEADQUARTERS
IN D.C.
SO THEY WEREN'T PARTICULARLY
TALKATIVE.
>> I'M A SMALL TIME REPORTER
FROM ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE.
>> GET YOUR BACK STRAIGHT.
>> I'M HERE TO DO AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW ON JOHN COURSON.
I'M GOING TO CALL IT THEY DON'T
ALLOW STRATEGIC DEFAULTERS.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR FACTS
TRAIT.
>> I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, SIR.
>> IF YOU NEED ANYTHING I'M HERE
TO HELP.
WE JUST WANT TO HELP YOU.
>> THROUGHOUT THIS WILL
TURBULENT ECONOMY, THE MORTGAGE
BANKERS ASSOCIATION HASN'T LOST
SIGHT OF THEIR CORE VALUES.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO AVOID THAT
FORECLOSURE AND KEEP THAT LOAN
ON THE BOOKS AND THE BORROWER IN
THE HOME.
>> AND IF HOMEOWNERS KEEP
PAYING, THE
