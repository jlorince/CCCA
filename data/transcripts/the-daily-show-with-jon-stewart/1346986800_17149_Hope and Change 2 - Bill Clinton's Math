FRAUD REPUBLICANS WERE ALWAYS COMPLAINING ABOUT.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN, ONE MAN WHO COULD RESCUE THE DAY.
THE BIG DOG!
42, MR. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON!
>> WE ARE HERE TO NOMINATE A PRESIDENT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WANT BARACK OBAMA TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> FOUR MORE YEARS!
>> Jon: NO, NO YOU KNOW, I CAN'T, I ALREADY SERVED MY TWO TERMS.
NO, I GET IT, I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, MAN, BUT JUST JUST-- THE CONSTITUTION IS
WHAT-- OH, YOU ME-- OH,
OKAY.
(LAUGHTER) BILL CLINTON FEEDS OFF AN AUDIENCE LIKE SUPERMAN DRAWING POWER FROM THE EARTH.
YELLOW SUN.
THAT OBLIGATION WILL BE DETERMINED BY THEIR SALARY.
THIS WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHOO!
SO AFTER AN INSPIRING BUT TIGHT 35 MINUTES STEM WINDER-- WHAT, THAT WASN'T
THE END, NOW THAT BRINGS ME TO HEALTH CARE.
>> Jon: 35 MINUTES INTO THIS THING ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO GO TO HEALTH CARE T IS
PAST 11:00 T IS KIND OF A COMPLICATED SUBJECT, BUT HAVE AT IT.
>> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
ARE WE BETTER OFF BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUGHT FOR HEALTH-CARE REFORM?
YOU BET WE ARE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
AND GOD BLESS THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN STILL CATCH THE VERY END OF THE COWBOYS GIANTS GAME ON --
>> THERE WERE TWO OTHER ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT IN TAMPA.
>> Jon: SON OF A BITCH!
(APPLAUSE) WHAT ARE YOU DOING!
(APPLAUSE) THIS IS NOT THE EVENT FROM LAST NIGHT THAT I WANTED TO GO INTO OVERTIME.
BUT ON HE WENT, THROUGH WELFARE REFORM, MEDICARE,
THE NATIONAL DEBT,
IMMIGRATION, WITH MORE FAULT ENDINGS THAN A JAMES BROWN CONCERT.
THE HARDEST LOVING MAN IN POLITICS.
FINALLY YIELDED THE STAGE AROUND 11:30 P.M. EASTERN,
PAST MY BEDTIME.
>> GOD BLESS YOU!
AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: DON'T STOP THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW, KUSES IT'S A HALF HOUR FROM NOW.
(LAUGHTER) BUT ALONG WITH PURE STAMINA,
BILL CLINTON WEDNESDAY FIGHT BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON THAT HAS BEEN MISSING.
>> CAME FROM A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT 2 AND 2 WAS 4.
>> Jon: MATH.
NUMBERS.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS BUT I HAVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH, MATH.
>> AN AMAZING DISPLAY OF ACTUALLY SAYING STUFF, MORE SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN ONE
SPEECH LAST NIGHT THAN THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP DID IN AN ENTIRE WEEK IN TAMPA.
>> WHAT HAS THE PRESIDENT DONE.
HE HAS OFFERED A REASONABLE PLAN OF FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT REDUCTION
OVER A DECADE FOR EVERY TWO AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING CUTS, HE RAISES
A DOLLAR IN NEW REVENUE,.
>> Jon: OH RATIOS.
MATHEMATICAL PARAMETERS FROM WHICH TO EXTRAPOLATE RESULTS.
NOT THAT THE REPUBLICANS DID NOT HAVE A PLAN TO START OFF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.
>> WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THIS NATION'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.
WE NEED TO STOP SPENDING MONEY WE DON'T HAVE.
WE WILL NOT DUCK THE TOUGH ISSUES.
WE WILL LEAVE.
>> AND AS THE LAST RESORT WE WILL USE-- HOW NUMERICALLY DEFICIENT WAS THE ENTIRE RNC.
NOT ONLY DID BILL CLINTON OFFER MORE SPECIFICS THAN THE DEMOCRATIC PLAN THAN THE
REPUBLICAN PLAN, HE ENDED UP WITH MORE SPECIFICS OF THE REPUBLICAN PLAN THAN THE REPUBLICANS.
>> THEY ALSO WANT TO BLOCK GRANT MEDICAID.
AND CUT IT BY A THIRD OVER THE COMING TEN YEARS.
>> IF THEY STAY WITH THIS $5 TRILLION TAX CUT PLAN, IN A DEBT REDUCTION PLAN, THE
ARITHMETIC TELLS US MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILLS GO UP AN AVERAGE OF $2,000 WHILE
ANYBODY WHO MAKES $3 MILLION OR MORE WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILL GO DOWN $250,000.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD.
MATH.
AND HERE'S WHAT, TO HEAR A GUY MAKE SENT YENT COMMENTS USING NUMBERS ON STAGE, ARE
YOU LIKE IT'S JUST LIKE A BEAUTIFUL MIND.
WHEN REALLY, SHOULDN'T IT JUST BE, I DON'T KNOW, A MIND.
ROMNEY, RYAN, YOUR REBUTTAL.
>> WHAT AMERICA NEEDS IS JOBS.
>> LOTS OF JOBS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AND FEWER SNAKES.
LOTS OF JOBS, NO SNAKES.
ROMNEY 2012.
GENTLEMEN, BRING THIS MOTHER
[BLEEP] HOME.
>> WE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
>> IN THE LAST 29 MONTHS,
OUR ECONOMY HAS PRODUCED ABOUT 4.5 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.
>> MY PROMISE IS TO HELP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
>> DURING THIS PERIOD, MORE THAN 500,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED UNDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> IF WE ARE SERIOUS AND SMART AND WE LEAD, WE CAN DO THIS.
>> SO WHAT-- REPUBLICANS 24 MILLION, DEMOCRATS 42.
>> Jon: [BLEEP] MATH WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
