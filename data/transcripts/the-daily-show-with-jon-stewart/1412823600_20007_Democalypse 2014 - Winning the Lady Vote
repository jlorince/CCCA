AWAY.
AND THEIR OUTCOME WILL BE IN THEHANDS  OF ONE CONSTITUENCY.

>> WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE THEONES WHO DECIDE WHO CONTROLS
THE SENATE.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: SEEMED AWFULLY,
SEEMED AWFULLY HIGH PITCHED.
WOMEN ARE THE TOP INTEREST GROUP IN 2014, AND IN LAST PLACE
ONCE AGAIN -- MERMAN LAWYERS.OH, I'M SO SORRY.
NOW USUALLY WOMEN ARE A SURETHING FOR DEMOCRATS,
BUT THIS YEAR THE GOP ISLAUNCHING A BIG REBRANDING
EFFORT TO CHANGE THAT. ANDYOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
>> REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO LEVERAGE THE WOMEN'S VOTE.
>> THIS BIG REBRANDING EFFORT.
>> THE NATIONAL COLLEGEREPUBLICANS, THEY RAN AN AD --
>> WITH THE IDEA OF ATTRACTINGYOUNGER WOMEN INTO VOTING
REPUBLICAN.
>> THE BARRAGE OF TVADVERTISEMENTS SPONSORED BY A
WELL FUNDED CONSERVATIVE GROUPFEATURING WOMEN.
>> A NEARLY $1 MILLION CAMPAIGN AD TO DRAW YOUNG
FEMALE VOTERS TO THE GOP.

OUTREACH TO WOMEN GOING?
>> IT'S SO GREAT, JON.
REPUBLICANS HAVE FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT'S MOST
IMPORTANT TO WOMEN.
MEN FOLK.
WOMEN DON'T SEE CANDIDATES ASPOTENTIAL LEADERS.
WE SEE THEM AS POSSIBLE SOULMATES.
REPUBLICANS ARE FINALLYRUNNING ADS TO REFLECT THAT.
>> WELCOME TO THE CANDIDATE.BACHELORETTE ASHLEY NOW MUST
MAKE HER FINAL DECISION.MARK'S ALWAYS INVADING MY SPACE,
SPYING ON MY MESSAGES, READINGMY EMAILS.

HE'S A MESS.
>> Jon: SO FAR THE GOP GOES,WOMEN THINK ELECTIONS ARE
JUST ABOUT GETTING INTO RELATIONSHIPS?
>> NO, NO.
THAT'S INSULTING AND REDUCTIVE.
WOMEN DON'T JUST THINK ABOUT GETTING INTO RELATIONSHIPS, WE
ALSO THINK ABOUT GETTING OUT OF THEM.
LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN WITH OBAMA.

THIS WHOLE ANGLE THAT THEREPUBLICANS CAME UP WITH,
IT FEELS LIKE, YOU REMEMBER WHENTHEY WANTED MORE GIRLS TO PLAY
PACMAN SO THEN THEY JUSTSLAPPED LIP STICK AND A BOW ON
PACMAN AND THEN CALLED IT MS.PACMAN?
>> YEAH. JON, MS. PACMAN IS AFEMINIST  HERO.
SHE DOESN'T SUBSCRIBE TO YOURPATRIARCHAL IDEA OF WHAT A
WOMAN'S BODY SHOULD LOOK LIKE.SHE ATE WHATEVER SHE WANTED.
PINEAPPLES, PRETZELS, GHOSTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW HER
COURAGE.
>> I DON'T FORGIVE YOU, JON.

HOW WOMEN'S BRAINS WORK.SCIENCE SHOWS THAT THIS PART

AND THE SMALL PART HERE ISBITCHINESS.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: WERE THOSE SCIENTISTS
MEN, BY ANY CHANCE?
>> YEAH.
THEY WERE SCIENTISTS.
WOMEN SCIENTISTS?

IT'S TIME FOR EVERY LITTLEGIRL'S WET DREAM,
FINDING A WEDDING DRESS.
