SHOULDER-- BUY SHOULDER MOUNTED STINGER MISSILES.
THAT IS TODAY'S GLOBAL UPDATE.
LET'S TURN TO HAPPIER NEWS.
REMEMBER CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER F NOT-- LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.
THIS IS HIS [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S HIS [BLEEP], YUP.
MY APOLOGIES IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE HD 3-DTVS AT HOME.
PROBABLY JUST KNOCKED A LAMP ALL YOUR TABLE.
(LAUGHTER) ANYWAY IT'S BEEN AROUND A YEAR SINCE THAT SCANDAL BROKE AND HE AND HIS WIFE
HUMA ABEDIN JUST POSED FOR A LOVELY STORY FOR "NEW YORK" MAGAZINE HOW ABOUT THEY
MOVED ON WITH THEIR LIVES.
GOOD FOR THEM.
ESPECIALLY HER.
WHAT A TERRIBLE, TOUGH YEAR FOR BOTH OF THEM.
NOW THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER.
THEY HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY,.
>> REPRESENTATIVE MICHELE BACHMANN AND FOUR OF HER REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN
CONGRESS ARE CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION.
THEY POINT FINGERS AT THIS WOMAN, HUMA ABEDIN,
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON'S DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF IMPLYING THAT SHE MAY
BE SOMEHOW WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OH MY GOD.
IT'S THE PERFECT COVER.
AN AMERICAN HATING MUSLIM EXTREMISTS GETS A HIGH PROFILE STRINGENT BACKGROUND
CHECK JOB WITH THE FORMER FIRST LADIES, MARRIES A PRO ISRAELI JEWISH GUY, AND
BEGINS PRODUCING MUSLIM ZYONIST TERROR BABY ARMIES.
(LAUGHTER) HAS 9/11 TAUGHT US NOTHING,
PEOPLE.
ALL RIGHT, SLOW DOWN,
STEWART, DON'T PANIC THIS IS BACHMANN WE ARE TALK BPING.
I KNOW IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT OUT VERY REASONABLY.
LET'S HEAR HER EVIDENCE.
>> LET'S START WITH ABEDIN'S FATHER, A PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND FOUNDER
OF THE INSTITUTE OF MUSLIM MINORITY AFFAIRS IN SAUDI ARABIA DECADES AGO.
PROFESSOR ABEDIN'S INSTITUTE HAD THE SUPPORT OF ANOTHER MAN NAMED DR. UMAR ABDALLA
NASIF A FORMER GENERAL SECRETARY OF ANOTHER GROUP CALLED THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE.
BACHMANN SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO THE PEW FORUM THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE HAS A HISTORY
OF, QUOTE, BEING CLOSELY ALIGNED AND PARTNERING WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
>> Jon: THAT IS [BLEEP]
AIRTIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) WE'VE GOT TO THROW THIS ONE UP ON THE BOARD.
ALL RIGHT.
SO HER DAD WHO HAS NOW UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY A LONG TIME AGO KNEW A GUY
LONGER TIME AGO WHO USED TO KNOW ANOTHER GUY WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
IT'S LIKE 6 DEGREES OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T EAT BACON.
LET'S SEE MICHELE BACHMANN EXPLAIN THIS THEORY TO CNN'S DONNA BASH.
>> HEY, CONGRESSWOMAN, HOW ARE YOU.
>> SORRY, I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.
>> I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU,
SENATOR McCAIN WAS ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND HE SAID WHAT YOU ARE DOING, GOING
AFTER HUMANA -- -- HUMA.
>> I CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW.
>> REQUEST YOU GO AN INTERVIEW LATE-- INTERVIEW LATER.
>> YES, I CAN.
>> Jon: I CAN'T GO RIGHT NOW,
I GOT TO, JUST UP OR DOWN, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST THE STAIRS AND THEN I-- JUST BYE.
THAT BACHMANN CAN MOVE.
(LAUGHTER) I THINK SHE'S LIKE THAT BUS IN THE MOVIE SPEED.
IF SHE SLOWS DOWN TOO MUCH HER MOUTH EXPLODES WITH STUPIDITY.
(LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY F YOU WANT TO BE THAT CIRCUITOUS YOU CAN PROBABLY CONNECT ALMOST
ANYONE TO ISLAMIC TERRORIST EVEN MICHELE BACHMANN.
THE NAME BACHMANN IS ALSO THE NAME OF A COMPANY THAT MAKES PRETZELS.
THE VERY SNACK COMPLICIT IN THE FAILED 2002 ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON GEORGE W. BUSH WHEN HE
CHOKED ON A BACHMANN PRETZEL.
IF THE ASSASSINATION HAD SUCCEEDED IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED BUSH FROM INVADING
IRAQ AND KILLED SADDAM HUSSEIN.
-- THIS IS REALLY HARD.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY AND DO THIS IN A SIMPLER WAY.
EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM WE LEARNED THE BANK HSBC WORKS WITH AL QAEDA.
IF THERE WAS SOME WAY,
ISLAMIC TER WIST-- TERRORIST MONEY DIRECTLY TO MICHELE BACK PAN LET'S SAY THROUGH A
2008 CAMPAIGN DONATION.
LET'S LOOK AT THE CHART AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.
HERE'S HUMA ABEDIN'S ISLAMIC TERROR CONNECTION, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
HERE'S MICHELE BACHMANN.
HMMMM.
MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION.
NOT TO MENTION ONE MORE PIECE OF UNSETTLING EVIDENCE,
MICHELE BACHMANN IS MARRIED TO MARCUS BACHMANN WHO I THINK WE ALL KNOW IS HIDING SOMETHING.
(LAUGHTER) THAT HIS NAME IS AN ANAGRAM OF ARAB'S MANN MUNCCH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
