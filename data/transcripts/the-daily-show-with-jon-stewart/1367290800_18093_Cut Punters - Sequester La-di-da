THE BEST PART OF THIS STORY, THE
HEARING CONGRESS HELD DEMANDING
ANSWERS ABOUTñr AIRLINE DELAYS
FROM F.A.A. DIRECTOR MICHAEL
HUERTA.
>> WE'VE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS
FOR YOU THIS MORNING.
THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE HOW
COME YOU DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT
THIS BEFOREHAND, THE SEQUESTER
IMPACT ON THE LAYOFFS,
FURLOUGHS?
NOT A WORD.
NOT A BREATH.
YOU DIDN'T FORWARN US THAT THIS
WAS COMING.
>> Jon:  WE WON'T EVER GET
OLD AND WE WON'T EVER DIE.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S CONGRESSMAN HAL ROGERS
THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE
APPROPRIATIONS WILL COMMITTEE,
THE COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES ALL
FEDERAL EXPENDITURES, ASKING WHY
THEY WERE NEVER TOLDçó THAT THE
SEQUESTER, THE CUTTING OF SAID
EXPENDITURES, WOULD IMPACT AIR
TRAVEL.
AND HE'S GOT A POINT.
WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT?
ROLE MONTAGE OF EVERYONE
MENTIONING THAT.
>> NO SEQUESTER DEAL IN SIGHT.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS AIR TRAVEL
GUILTY HAYWIRE.
>> FEDERAL SPENDING CUTS
THREATEN DELAYS IN AIR TRAVEL.
>> YOU'RE GOING TO SEE LINES AT
THE AIRPORTS.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FURLOUGHS.
>> FEWER FLIGHTS AND DELAYS OF
UP TO 90 MINUTES OR MORE.
>> SOME FLIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE
CANCELED.
TOWERS SHUT DOWN FOR PERIOD OF
TIMES TO DEAL WITH THESE BUDGET
CUTS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  WHAT DO THEY MEAN
BY THAT?
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, FINE.
BUT WE NEVER HEARD THAT FROM...
THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION.
ROLL FOOTAGE OF THE SECRETARY OF
TRORS.
>> WELL, LOOK, WHEN IT COMES TO
TRANSPORTATION, WE HAVE TO CUT
$1 BILLION, $600 MILLION FROM
F.A.A., AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE
ANNOUNCED THERE'S GOING TO BE A
SLOWDOWN AND DELAYS IN FLIGHTS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FURLOUGH
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  ADDING HOW LOUD DO
I HAVE TO ( BLEEP ) SAY IT?
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
LOOK, YOU KNOW,.
( CHEERS )
-- WHAT-- THIS IS KIND OF FUN.
WATCH CONGRESSMAN ROGERS
CONFRONT WITH THE FACT THAT HE
WAS FORWARNED.
WATCH HIM ASIMULATE THIS NEW
INFORMATION AND STILL FIND A WAY
TOUE IT AGAINST HIS OPPONENT
USING SOME KIND OF DICK-JITSUE
MOVE.
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
REDUCTION IN AVAILABLE
CONTROLLER HOURS OF 10% FOR
MONTHS.
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM
WHICH AIRPORTS, WHICH AIRLINES.
>> WE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD
EXPECT SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS AT
MAJOR HUB FACILITIES.
>> WELL, LA-TI-DA.
EVERYONE KNEW THAT.
>> Jon:  "LA-TI-DA."
"I MEAN, I MEAN, MAJOR AIRPORT
HUB COULD BE-- COULD BE
ANYTHING.
I DON'T KNOW."
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
"I MEAN, ( BLEEP ) ME TWICE WITH
