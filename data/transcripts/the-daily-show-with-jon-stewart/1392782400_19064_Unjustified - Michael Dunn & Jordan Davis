WAIT.
THE CAR WAS FLEEING AND HE SHOTON IT.
HOW WAS DUNN STANDING HISGROUND?
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS ACTUALLYGAINING GROUND.
HE KILLED SOMEONE.
APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT WHAT HE ISGOING TO JAIL FOR.
>> MICHAEL DUNN WAS FOUND GUILTYTHAT'S THREE COUNTS OFATTEMPTED
MURDER FOR SHOOTING AT THE OTHERTHREE YOUNG MEN IN THE CAR, THE
ONES WHO SURVIVED.
>> THE MESSAGE IN FLORIDA ISPRETTY CLEAR.
IF YOU FIRE A GUN YOU BETTER(bleep) HIT SOMEBODY.
[ LAUGHTER ]IF THERE'S ONE THING FLORIDIANS
WON'T TOLERATE IT'S SURVIVORS.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY JESSICAWILLIAMS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THIS JURY -- ON THE MURDER
CHARGE, THE HUNG JURY IN THEMURDER CHARGE, ITS GOTTA BE HARD
TO TAKE.
>> YEAH, JON, THE DUNN VERDICTIS REALLY THE CHERRY ON TOP OF
(bleep) SUNDAE THAT IS BLACKHISTORY MONTH. FIRST WE GOT
ASSIGNED FEBRUARY THE MONTHNOBODY WANTS.
THE ONLY MONTH THAT CONTAINS THELETTERS F AND U AND THEN, IN
CASE WE DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGETHEY ROUND OUT THE MONTH BY
LETTING ANOTHER WHITE GUY OFFFOR GUNNING DOWN A BLACK KID.
YOU DO KNOW BLACK HISTORY MONTHIS NOT LIKE DEER SEASON ORTURKEY SEASON, RIGHT?
IT'S NOT THE MONTH WHEN YOU AREALLOWED TO SHOOT BLACK PEOPLE.
>> Jon: THAT'S -- OKAY.
WHY DO YOU THINK THE JURYBELIEVED HIS SELF DEFENSE CLAIM?
THE KIDS WERE UNARMED.
>> SURE, THEY LOOKED UNARMED TOUS AND THE POLICE AND OTHER EYE
WITNESSES BUT THAT'S BECAUSEWE'RE NOT WEARING FEAR GOGGLES.
>> Jon: FEAR GOGGLES?
>> THAT'S THE LENS THROUGH WHICHCHRONICALLY TERRIFIED WHITE
PEOPLE LOOK AT BLACK KIDS.
LIKE, SAY, A GUY WHO CARRIES AGUN IN HIS GLOVE COMPARTMENT AND
THINKS FLORIDA JURIES FAVORBLACK PEOPLE.
FEAR GOGGLES TURN SOMETHING LIKETHIS INTO THIS.
ONCE YOU PUT ON FEAR GOGGLESYOU'LL HIT ANYTHING WITH A
BULLET.
ANYTHING.
>> Jon:  WHAT CANYOUNG BLACK PEOPLE DO THEN IN
THE FACE OF THIS AUTOMATIC FEAR.
>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.
I'VE COME UP WITH A NEWCURRICULUM FOR BLACK HISTORYMONTH.
FORGET THAT GEORGE WASHINGTONCARVER PEANUT CRAP.
THEY NEED LIFE LESSONS THEY CANUSE.
>> Jon: LIKE WHAT?
STAY IN SCHOOL, KIDS.
>> Jon: GOOD ADVICE FORANYBODY.
>> BY WHICH I MEAN IF YOU ARE ATSCHOOL, STAY IN THE BUILDING.
IF YOU ARE AT HOME, STAY ATHOME. DON'T GO WANDERING INTOTHE
STREET WHERE YOU MIGHT SCARE AWHITE PERSON.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHATEVER YOU NEED, ORDER IT IN,
SEAMLESS, AMAZON PRIME,ZAPPOS, THOSE ARE YOUR FRIENDSNOW.
WHICH BRINGS US TO LESSON TWO,DON'T HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS
ANYMORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: STAY INSIDE -- ISN'T
THERE SAFETY IN NUMBERS?
>> NOT FOR BLACK TEENAGERS.
THE ONLY THING SCARIER THAN ONEBLACK KID IS A WHOLE PACK OF
THEM.
FOUR BLACK GUYS COULD BE TAKINGA CALCULUS TEST TOGETHER AND TO
JUMPY WHITE FOLKS IT WOULD STILLLOOK LIKE A SCENE FROM THE WIRE.
LESSON THREE, TURN THE MUSICOFF.
>> Jon: WHAT IF IT'S NOT RAP.
CAN'T THEY LISTEN TO CLASSICAL?
>> LIKE WHAT YO YO MA BECAUSETHAT SOUNDS GHETTO TO ME, JON.
>> Jon: WHAT IF THE BLACK KIDSSAID THEY FELT THREATENED
BECAUSE DUNN ACTUALLY HAD A GUNAND HE CAME AFTER THEM.
COULDN'T THEY HAVE SHOT DUNN ANDCLAIMED STAND YOUR GROUND?
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, HAVE YOU SEENTHE STATISTICS THAT WORKS FOR
BLACK PEOPLE ABOUT 1% OF THETIME.
THE STAND YOUR GROUND DEFENSE ISLIKE BLEACH.
IT WORKS MIRACLES FOR WHITES BUTIT WILL RUIN YOUR COLORS.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
