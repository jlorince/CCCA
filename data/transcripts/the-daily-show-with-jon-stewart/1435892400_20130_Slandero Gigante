>> Jon: HI, EVERYBODY!
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NATE.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF OURALL-TIME FAVORITES, SARAH VOWELL
WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT.
WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS THE LAST SHOW BEFORE WEGO ON A BREAK, A COUPLE-WEEK
BREAK.
THEN WHEN WE GET BACK, BASICALLYIT'S A THREE-WEEK RUN TO THE
FINALE.
OBVIOUSLY, I'VE GOT A LOT OFMIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT THIS, BUT I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE PERSONWHO'S BEEN THERE FOR ME, REALLY
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE RUN, BUTESPECIALLY NEAR THE END OF THE
RUN.
HIS NAME IS DONALD.
(LAUGHTER)
AND...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD MAN.
AND DONALD RECENTLY GLIDED BACKINTO MY LIFE ON HIS SOLID GOLD
UP AND DOWN PEOPLE MOVER,CRANKED UP THE UNAUTHORIZED
NEIL YOUNG, OPENED UP HIS CRAZYHOLE AND MADE A PROMISE TO ME
THAT I WOULD NEVER BE WITHOUTMATERIAL AGAIN!
(LAUGHTER)
>> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITSPEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT SENDING
THEIR BEST.
THEY'RE SENDING PEOPLE THAT HAVELOTS OF PROBLEMS, AND THEY'RE
BRINGING THOSE PROBLEMS WITH US.
THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS.
THEY'RE BRINGING CRIME.
THEY'RE RAPISTS.
AND SOME, I ASSUME, ARE GOODPEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT'S OUR DONALD TRUMPREMINDING AMERICA THAT AS MANY
AS A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE --
(LAUGHTER)
-- COMING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERNBORDER ARE NOT RAPISTS!
(LAUGHTER)
HE ASSUMES...
HE'S SURE ABOUT THE RAPIST PART.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FEELS THAT, I GUESS, BYPURE LAW OF AVERAGES, THERE ARE
PROBABLY SOME NON-RAPISTSCAUGHT UP IN THAT TIDE, WHETHER
THEY'RE UNABLE TO RAPE FORMEDICAL REASONS OR --
(LAUGHTER)
-- OR WHETHER THEY ARE JUST ALLRAPED OUT!
(LAUGHTER)
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THISSTATEMENT FROM A REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE --
(LAUGHTER)
WAS NOTICED.
>> NBC ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CUTALL BUSINESS TIES TO DONALD
TRUMP.
>> UNIVISION IS DROPPING ALLTIES WITH DONALD TRUMP.
>> MACY'S JOINS THE LIST.
>> ADD SERTA MATTRESS COMPANYTO THE LIST.
>> RICKY MARTIN IS YANKING HISFO UNDATION GOLF TOURNAMENT OFF
TRUMP PROPERTY.
>> Jon: I AM SHOCKED!
I AM SHOCKED THAT SO MANY PEOPLEWERE OKAY GOING DOING BUSINESS
WITH DONALD TRUMP UP TO THISPOINT --
(LAUGHTER)
-- BUT YOU KNOW OUR P.C.CULTURE IMMEDIATELY MOVES TO
SHUT CONTROVERSIAL SPEAKERS UPAND CENSOR THEM BY INTERVIEWING
THEM EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME.
>> BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER ORNOT YOU WOULD STICK BY THESE
COMMENTS.
>> DO YOU REGRET YOU DIDN'T HAVEA SCRIPT?
DO YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE FORANYTHING?
>> WOULD YOU TAKE ANY OF THATBACK?
>> DO YOU REGRET SAYING THATSPECIFICALLY ABOUT RAPIST OR DO
YOU STAND BY IT?
>> Jon: AND BEFORE YOU ANSWER,REMEMBER MY QUESTION INCLUDED
THE WORDS REGRET, RAPIST, ANDYOU!
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH, IN THE NEWS BUSINESS,IS CALLED A HINT!
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, MR. TRUMP WASSPEAKING EXTEMPORANEOUSLY.
DID DONALD TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITYTO WALK BACK HIS COMMENTS, TO
EXPRESS REGRET OVERMISREPRESENTING THE SITUATION OF
SAYING SOMETHING INELEGANTLY?
OF COURSE NOT.
AND YOU KNOW WHY HE'S NOTWALKING THEM BACK?
BECAUSE WALKING IS FOR LOSERS.
(LAUGHTER)
WINNERS GLIDE.
USUALLY DOWN ESCALATORS, INTOMALLS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> OF COURSE, THEY'RE CRIMINALSIN MANY CASES.
WHY WOULD I CHANGE THATSTATEMENT?
SOME ARE GOOD, RAPIST, SOMEARE KILLERS.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A SMALLPERCENTAGE.
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUTMEXIO, TALKING ABOUT ALL OVER
THE WORLD, THEY'RE COMINGTHROUGH SOUTHERN BORED.
I'M NOT KNOCKING ANYBODY.
IF I WERE DOING MEXICO, WOULD BESEDTING THE KILLERS, DRUG
DEALERS, RAPISTS --
>> Jon:IT'S AN INTERESTINGGLIMPSE INTO THE POLICIES OF
A POSSIBLE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.
I WOULD DEFINTELY AND LAWLESSLYPUT ALL OF MY COUNTRY'S CIMINAL
RAPISTS ON A BUS AND SEND THEMTO THE NEXT CLOSET COUNTRY TO
THE NORTH.
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, SUCKON THAT, CANADA.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, I KNOW IT'S A FOOL'S ERRANDTO TRY AND DISPROVE THE RAVINGS
OF A MAD MAN, BUT ACCORDINGTOA STUDY IN A PEER REVIEWED
JOURNAL CRIMINOLOGY, THERE'SNO CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASED
IMMIGRATION OF ANY KIND ANDINCREASED RAPES OR VIOLENT
CRIME.
APPARENTLY HURTING AND KILLINGIS ONE OF THOSE JOBS AMERICANS
ARE STILL VERY WILLING TO DOTHEMSELVES.
DONALD, CAN YOU POINT TOANYTHING THAT BACKS UP YOUR
STATEMENT?
>> THIS WAS AN ARTICLE BYFUSION.
SOMEBODY SAID FUSION'S OWNED BYUNIVISION.
THIS ONE SAYS 80% OF CENTRALAMERICAN WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE
RAPED CROSSING INTO THE UNITEDSTATES.
>> THAT'S ABOUT WOMEN BEINGRAPED.
IT'S NOT ABOUT CRIMINALS COMINGACROSS THE BORDER OR ENTERING
THE COUNTRY.
>> WELL, SOMEBODY'S DOING THERAPING, DON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: TOUCHE.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE OUR CAMPAIGNSLOGAN FROM 2016 -- SOMEBODY'S
DOING THE RAPING...
(APPLAUSE)
IT IS HARD TO GET MAD AT DONALDTRUMP FOR SAYING STUPID THINGS,
IN THE SAME WAY YOU DON'T GETMAD AT A MONKEY WHEN HE THROWS
POOP AT YOU AT THE ZOO.
IT'S A MONKEY.
IT'S WHAT THEY DO.
IN SOME WAYS IT'S ON YOU FORWATCHING.
WHAT DOES GET ME ANGRY IS THERIDICULOUS, DISINGENUOUS
DEFENDING OF THE POOP-THROWINGMONKEY.
>> YA KNOW, A LOT OF POLITICIANSWOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED BY NOW AND
SAID, WELL, THIS IS WHAT IREALLY MEANT.
THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE MEANT,LARGELY.
HE SAID, YA KNOW, THERE --THERE'S A PROBLEM WHEN THE
SOUTHERN BORDER IS NOT SECURE.
>> Jon: NOBODY REALLYCANCELING BUSINESS WITH DONALD
TRUMP IF HE HAD SAID IN HISSPEECH, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A
PROBLEM WHEN OUR SOUTHERNBORDERS ARE INSECURE.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID.
>> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE,THEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST.
THEY'RE RAPISTS.
AND SOME, I ASSUME, ARE GOODPEOPLE.
>> Jon: HE'S STILL NOT EVENSURE IF SOME ARE GOOD PEOPLE!
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT HAPPENSIS THAT -- THAT IT GETS
DISTORTED, PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT.
>> HE DIDN'T SAY MOST MEXICANSWERE RAPISTS.
HE SAID THEY ARE -- HE'SSPEAKING -- GENERALLY SPEAKING
OF THE CRIMINALS THAT ARE DOINGTHIS.
>> Jon: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHATTHAT MEANS, BUT I KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT HE SAID!
LET ME PLAY THIS AGAIN AT ASPEED EVEN STEVE KING CAN
UNDERSTAND.
(PLAYING SLOWLY)>> THEY'RE RAPISTS.
AND SOME, I ASSUME, ARE GOODPEOPLE.
>> Jon: GET...
IT...
STEVE?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHATPEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT?
(APPLAUSE)
SO ARE WE SETTLED?
>> SHOULD HE APOLOGIZE FOR WHATHE SAID?
>> I DON'T THINK HE SHOULDAPOLOGIZE FOR SPEAKING OUT
AGAINST THE PROBLEM THAT ISILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
I RECOGNIZE THE P.C. WORLD, THEMAINSTREAM MEDIA DON'T WANT TO
ADMIT IT --
>> Jon: THAT IS SUCH BUZZWORD NOTHING (BLEEP).
IT DOES NOTHING -- WHO DOESN'TWANT TO ADMIT WHAT?
LET'S GET STRAIGHT WHAT DONALDTRUMP SAID, ONE LAST TIME.
ALL TOGETHER NOW, FOLLOW THECLASSY BALL.
>> THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS...
THEY'RE BRINGING CRIME...
THEY'RE RAPISTS...
AND SOME, I ASSUME, ARE GOODPEOPLE.
♪♪(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: STOP PRETENDING HEDIDN'T SAY AND IS STICKING TO
WHAT HE SAID.
-- WHICH IS, MEXICO IS PURPOSELYSENDING US DRUGS, KILLERS AND
RAPISTS, AND WITHIN THAT GROUPTHERE MAY BE -- HE'S NOT SURE --
SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD.
THAT'S THE PART HE'S NOT SUREABOUT.
HE'S ONLY SURE ABOUT THEOVERWHELMING NUMBER OF KILLERS,
RAPIST AND DRUG ADDICTS MEXICOHAS SENT US.
THAT IS WHAT HE [BLEEP] SAID.
BUT, THE ONE GOOD THING TO COMEOUT OF THIS IS THE FARCE OF THIS
CANDIDACY IS FINALLY EXPOSED.
HIS UNSERIOUSNESS IS ON DISPLAYFOR ALL VOTERS TO SEE AND THE
RESULTS WILL BE OBVIOUS.
>> THE BILLIONAIRE HAS JUMPED TOSECOND PLACE AMONG REPUBLICANS
IN A RECENT NATIONAL POLL, ALSOPLACING SECOND IN THE FIRST TWO
CRITICAL BATTLE GROUNDERS OFIOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.
>> Jon: (BLEEP) ME.
WE'LL BE BACK.
