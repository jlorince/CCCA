>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME LAURAPOITRAS.
(APPLAUSE)THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, FIRST OFALL, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE
DOCUMENTARY.
SUSPENSEFUL, REVEALING.
I MEAN EVERYTHING THAT YOUWOULD LOVE TO SEE IN A
DOCUMENTARY.
BUT EXPLAIN HOW YOU GOTACCESS TO EDWARD SNOWDEN AND
HOW YOU PUT THIS ALLTOGETHER IN A HOTEL ROOM IN
HONG KONG BEFORE THIS HADEVER BECOME PUBLIC.
>> WELL, IT'S-- I'M GLAD YOULIKED THE MOVIE.
AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, ITIS VERY SUSPENSEFUL BECAUSE I
STARTED RECEIVING STRANGE,MYSTERIOUS ANONYMOUS
E-MAILS IN JANUARY 2013.
>> Jon: SURE.
I GET THOSE.
(LAUGHTER)>> YEAH, I KNOW. AND SAYING KIND
OF REALLY, YOU KNOW, BIZARRETHINGS.
SAYING LIKE THAT I HAD CHOSENMYSELF. AND THAT, YOU KNOW,
THAT I WAS WATCHED EVERY TIMETHAT I CROSSED THE BORDER.
BUT I TOOK IT PRETTYSERIOUSLY.
AND STARTED WRITING BACKAND WE CORRESPONDING OVER
THE COURSE OF FIVE MONTHS.
>> Jon: AND HE WASCALLING HIMSELF CITIZENFOUR.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WAS USING AN ANONYMOUSE-MAIL ACCOUNT.
OF COURSE I USED ANANONYMOUS E-MAIL ACCOUNT.
WE DID ALL KINDS OF CRAZYTHINGS TO KEEP THE
COMMUNICATION SECURE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN IT ENDED UP THATGLENN GREENWALD AND I
TRAVELED TO HONG KONG. WE METWITH HIM.
>> Jon: NOW THIS IS, AT THISPOINT, HE KNEW THAT THE
INTERVIEW THAT HE DID WITHGLENN WAS GOING BECOME
PUBLIC.
NOT-- HE WASN'T GOINGTO BECOME PUBLIC BUT THE
ISSUE.
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, HE HAD A BIT OFA-- I MEAN, HE BELIEVES THAT THE
ISSUE IS WHAT HE WANTS PEOPLETO CARE ABOUT -- HE
DIDN'T COME FORWARD BECAUSEHE WANTED THE ATTENTION.
BUT HE KNEW THAT WHAT WOULDHAPPEN IS THAT THE MEDIA
WOULD TALK ABOUT HIM.
SO HE MADE THE DECISION.
AND THEN GLENN AND I STARTEDPUBLISHING.
AND THEN WHEN-- ONCE IT WASCLEAR THE GOVERNMENT KNEW
THAT HE WAS PROBABLY THESOURCE, THE GOVERNMENT
VISITS HIS HOUSE WHILE WE'RESTILL IN HONG KONG.
>> Jon: THEY TALK TO HIS GIRLFRIEND.
>> YEAH, THEY TALK TOHIS GIRLFRIEND.
THERE'S SOMEBODY VISITING.
AND THEN WE PUBLISHED THEINTERVIEW.
AND THEN KIND OF THINGS GOT ALITTLE CRAZY.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT IS SOINCREDIBLE.
SO YOU ARE IN THIS LITTLEHOTEL ROOM IN HONG KONG AND
YOU ARE WATCHING AS THESTORY CATCHES FIRE IN A WAY
THAT I THINK SEEMS TO CATCHEVERYONE A LITTLE BIT OFF
GUARD.
JUST THE FEROCITY OF IT, ANDTHE EXPANSION OF IT.
>> YEAH, I MEAN GLENN AND I,I THINK WE DIDN'T EXPECT
THERE WOULD BE THE AMOUNT OFATTENTION THERE WAS ON IT,
AND FROM THE FIRST STORY THATGLENN DID ON VERIZON, WHICH
SHOWS THE NSA IS COLLECTINGALL OF OUR PHONE RECORDS IN
THE UNITED STATES.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT WAS A HUGE STORY. IT WENTEVERYWHERE.
AND SO IT WAS A LITTLE BITLIKE BEING IN A TIME CAPSULE
IN THIS HOTEL ROOM AND THENWE, YOU KNOW, THEN WE LEFT.
>> Jon: IT WAS FASCINATINGTO WATCH HIM BECAUSE KNOWING
NOTHING ABOUT HIM AND ONLYTHROUGH THE --
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SORT OFHAD A SENSE THAT SORT OF A
NARCISSISTIC GUY, A LITTLEBIT OF, YOU KNOW,
SELF-PROMOTING.
DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY ATALL.
HE SEEMS REALLY CONFLICTEDABOUT THE WHOLE THING.
>> YEAH. YEAH.
>> Jon: HE SEEMS TO NOTREALIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
OFF AT THAT SAME LEVEL.
BUT HE KNOWS IT IS GOING TOBE SOMETHING LIKE IT
PAINTS A VERY COMPLEX BUT MUCHMORE SYMPATHETIC PORTRAIT OF A
GUY.
I THINK EVERYONE HAD THIS SENSETHAT HE IS A MASTERMIND.
HE SEEMS MUCH LESS THAT IN THEFILM.
>> NO I MEAN, HE IS REALLYSOMEBODY WHO HE FELT THAT HE WAS
SEEING THINGS THE PUBLIC SHOULDKNOW ABOUT AND HE DID NOT
INTERESTED IN THE ATTENTION.
WHEN I ASKED TO FILM WITH HIM,HIS FIRST RESPONSE WAS NO,
I'M NOT THE STORY. HE SAYS THATCONSISTENTLY.
BUT I CONVINCED HIM, I KIND OFMADE A MOVIE ABOUT HIM SO I
GUESS HE'S THE STORY NOW.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I DON'TRECOMMEND DOING THAT,
MAKING -->> YEAH, I KNOW.
MAKING MOVIES IS HARD.
>> Jon: SO WHAT IS SO-- ITHINK WHAT ALMOST HEARTBREAK
ABOUT THIS, SO NOW ALL THISINFORMATION COMES OUT.
WE KNOW IT ALL.
THE GOVERNMENT LIES ABOUT IT.
THEY TESTIFY ABOUT IT,CLAPPER SAYS WE'RE NOT DOING --
WHAT ARE YOU TALKINGABOUT? HAS TO COME BACK A COUPLE
MONTHS LATER, OKAY, YEAH, WEWERE DOING THAT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT IN A WEIRD WAY ITJUST SORT OF LAYS THERE.
SO NOW WE KNOW IT AND WE'REALL, HMMMM, WELL, THAT'S
SOMETHING.
YET HIS LIFE IS IMPACTED INA WAY THAT IS DEVASTATING.
>> YES.
BUT HE KNEW THOSE RISKS.
I MEAN HE WENT IN, I THINK HEWAS READY TO ACCEPT ANY RISKS,
AND FEELING THAT THIS WAS JUSTINFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC
SHOULD KNOW.
AND I THINK HE FEELS GOODABOUT THAT.
>> Jon: IS IT HARD FOR HIM?
I MEAN, HE'S IN RUSSIA AND, YOUKNOW, YOU'RE UNDER AN
AUTHORITARIAN REGIME THAT ISFAR MORE SUPPRESSING OF
INFORMATION THAN ANYTHING WE DO.
IS THAT SEEM LIKE A CRUELIRONY TO HIM?
>> I MEAN, IT'S NOT WHERE HEEVER INTENDED TO BE.
HE WAS TRANSITTING THROUGH, HEWAS TRYING TO LEAVE HONG KONG TO
GET TO LATIN AMERICA AND HISPASSPORT WAS REVOKED AND
THAT'S HOW HE ENDED UPTHERE. IT'S, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
HIS INTENTION WAS TO MEETTHE JOURNALISTS AND TO MAKE
INFORMATION THAT HE FELT WASIN THE PUBLIC INTEREST PUBLIC.
>> Jon: WAS HE NAIVE, DO YOUTHINK?
>> I MEAN, I THINK HE WASNAIVE IN THE SENSE THAT HE
FELT THAT, SO WE LIVE IN ACOUNTRY THAT HAS A
CONSTITUTION AND THAT HE FELT --
>> Jon: NO, IT'S BEENSHREDDED, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
SAW EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM.>> I KNOW. YEAH.
>> SHREDDED A BUNCH OFDIFFERENT TIMES.
OH YEAH, THE WHOLE THING'S GONENOW.
>> IT'S GONE, YEAH. SO HESORT OF STILL BELIEVES IN THE
CONSTITUTION, AND BELIEVES-- .
>> Jon: HE SEEMS VERYIDEALISTIC.
>> HE IS VERY IDEALISTIC.
AND HE BELIEVES THE FOURTHAMENDMENT IS STILL THE LAW
AND THAT OUR PRIVACY, YOUKNOW, MATTERS.
AND SO YEAH, HE'S IDEALISTIC.
>> Jon: I WANNA -- SO, CAN YOUSTICK AROUND FOR JUST A LITTLE
BIT? >> YEAH.
>> Jon: WE'LL COME BACK.
I JUST WANT TO TALKABOUT, HOW HE MADE THE
DECISION TO DO IT IN THEMANNER THAT HE DID, AS
OPPOSED TO SORT OF, YOU KNOW,BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN, THERE
HAVE BEEN SOME WHISTLE-BLOWERCASES LIKE THE DRAKE CASE WHERE
THE GOVERNMENT THREATENED THEMWITH TREMENDOUS, LIKE A LOT OF
HEAT ON THEM.
AND IS THAT WHY HE CHOSE TOGO THE ROUTE THAT HE WENT?
BUT WE'LL GET INTO THAT IN ALITTLE BIT.
"CITIZENFOUR," IN THEATRESNOW, MAN, FASCINATING.
LAURA POITRAS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
