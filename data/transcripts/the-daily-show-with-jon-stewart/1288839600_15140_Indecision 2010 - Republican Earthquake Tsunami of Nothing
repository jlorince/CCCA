>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
I FEEL ALIVE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GREAT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR OLD FRIEND CHRIS WALLACE,
FOX NEWS SUNDAY IS MY GUEST.
THE ONLY EMPLOYEE WE KNOW OF AT FOX NEWS THAT WILL NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2012
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND.
ALTHOUGH MAYBE DEVELOP AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR -- HE WILL HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR US THIS EVENING.
OBVIOUSLY LAST NIGHT MID TERM ELECTIONS.
WE STAYED UP.
WE PARTIED DOWN.
BIG NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICANS.
THEY TOOK BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 11 SEATS STILL TO BE DECIDED.
INCREASED THEIR MARGIN OF CONTROL IN THE SENATE FROM 41 SEATS OUT OF 100 TO 47.
SOME BO ARGUE THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE SENATE.
DEMOCRATS DON'T CONTROL THE SENATE?
PEOPLE THAT ARGUE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW (bleep) THE SENATE REALLY IS.
IT'S A SILLY AND RIDICULOUS PLACE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SOME OF THE BIG WINNERS THE PARTY OF TEA.
WHERE PARTY APPROVED CANDIDATES SUCH AS RAND PAUL OF KENTUCKY,
MARCO RUBIO OF FLORIDA AND ANOTHER BIG WINNER LAST NIGHT WOMEN WHO LONG AGO PROVED THEY
COULD WIN JOINED MEN IN THE CATEGORY OF BLOWING ONE'S OWN MONEY WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.
>> MEG WHITMAN SPENT MORE THAN ANYONE IN HISTORY $140 MILLION.
>> Jon: WE DID IT, GIRLS, WE DID IT.
WE SHATTERED THE WASTE CEILING!
♪ WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE ♪ ♪ DOING IT OUR WAY ♪
WERE YOU REALLY TRYING TO FOLLOW THAT WITH A CAMERA?
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY EXCELLENT PLACE TO BUY WHITMAN-FOR-GOVERNOR SWAG.
eBAY.
TONIGHT'S SINGLE BID IS WORTH $140 MILLION IN RETURN.
WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN?
THE BIGGEST WINNER WAS JOHN BOEHNER NOW IN LINE TO BECOME SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
CAN'T SEE IT THERE BUT HE'S BLUSHING.
TAKE IT AWAY BIG MAN.
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.
>> I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE CHASING -- THE AMERICAN DREAM --
WORKING EVERY ROTTEN JOB THERE WAS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HEY, THIS IS AWKWARD.
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT.
I UNDERSTAND.
LET ME JUST VERY QUICKLY.
HERE IS SAY -- THERE WE GO.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
GET IT OUT.
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS, BABY, GIVE ME ONE MORE.
GIVE ME ONE MORE.
THAT'S ONE --
[LAUGHTER]
LISTEN, IT WAS A BIG NIGHT.
OF COURSE, EVEN THE REPUBLICANS HAD THEIR LIMITS.
IT IS A BAD NIGHT FOR OUR OVERTON WINDOW CANDIDATES, THE ONES WHO WERE THERE TO MAKE THE
OTHERS SEEM SANE IN COMPARISON.
DELAWARE'S CHRISTINE O'DONNELL LOST, IN NEVADA THEY LOST AND
OUR FAVORITE CARL PALLADINO OF THE BUFFALO PALLADINOS.
>> YOU CAN GRAB THIS HANDLE AND PULL THE PEOPLE TO ALBANY OR LEAVE IT UNTOUCHED AND RUN THE
RISK OF HAVING IT WIELDED AGAINST YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN A CANDIDATE GIVE AN AGGRESSION SPEECH.
I'VE SEEN THIS SCENE ONCE BEFORE.
>> WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SAY?
I GUESS NOWHERE UNLESS THE TEAM WINS.
>> TEAM.
>> TEAM.
>> Jon: ENTHUSIASMS IT GIVES ME ENTHUSIASMS.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU ENJOYED THAT YOU'LL ENJOY MY NEW SHOW JON STEWART MAKES A CONNECTION TO
ANYONE HOLDING A BAT TO THE UNTOUCHABLES.
ENTHUSIASMS.
HAD A OF LAUGH YOU KNOW WHAT I FORGET IN THAT MOVIE, THE SOUND WHEN THE BAT HIT THE HEAD WHEN
YOU HEAR -- REALLY NICE.
[LAUGHTER]
DEMOCRATIC VICTORY THERE'S RIGHT NOW.
JOE MANCHIN WEST VIRGINIA WON IN THE SENATE.
BARNEY FRANK WON IN THE HOUSE.
EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK STATE.
THERE WAS ONE CONSISTENT LOSING MESSAGE IN THIS ELECTION AND THAT MESSAGE WAS:  I KNOW
PRESIDENT OBAMA PERSONALLY.
V.A. HAVE LOST.
STRICKLAND OF OHIO LOST.
ILLINOIS LOST.
LOSING THE SENATE THAT I BELIEVE TWO SHORT YEARS AGO BELONGED TO A BARACK OBAMA.
[LAUGHTER]
DO WE HAVE A SOUND EFFECT FOR THAT HAPPENING?
>> UMFPH!
>> Jon: IF MILLIONS VOTED,
MILLIONS MORE HAD TO ANALYZE THE VOTE.
ABC LEAD WITH THE 12 MAN BOX.
CNN TOOK IN STUDIO HONORS CLEVERLY HOLDING TWO OR THREE SEDERS ZURRING THEIR COVERAGE.
AS ALWAYS MORE MEANT BETTER.
>> REPUBLICAN, REPUBLICAN,
REPUBLICAN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT WAS THE ANALYSIS.
FOR REPUBLICANS IT WAS ALL ABOUT SIZE.
>>?
IT'S A NICAL WAVE.
>> A TIDAL WAVE ELECTION.
>> A TIDAL WAVE OR A TSUNAMI.
>> WE HAD A TSUNAMI.
TO MES THAT AN EARTHQUAKE.
>> THIS IS LIKE 1811, 1812 WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE WAS SO DEVASTATING IT MADE THE PH *GS
MISSISSIPPI RIVER RUN BACKWARDS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU DO REALIZE ALL YOUR METAPHORS FOR REPUBLICAN VICTORY KILLED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE?
YOU DO REALIZE THAT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: TONIGHT IS A GREAT NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICANS A WIN OF BUBONIC PROPORTIONS, A BLACK
DEATH THAT HAS SWEPT THE NATION,
A TRUE NIGHT OF REPUBLICAN EBOLA.
AN HISTORIC NIGHT, EARTH SHAKING RIVER REVERSING TSUNAMI OF REPUBLICAN WINS.
OH, MY GOD, PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO THEM FOR ANSWERS.
LET THE ASS COVERING BEGIN.
>> IT IS NOT A BIG MANDATE FOR REPUBLICANS.
THEY'LL CONTROL, IF YOU WILL,
ONE SIXTH OF GOVERNMENT.
>> THE REPUBLICANS WON'T BE CONTROLLING THE GOVERNMENT.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS STILL THE BIG DUKE.
IT'S THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
THIS IS THE OBAMA ERA.
>> IT'S THE PRESIDENT WHO SETS THE AGENDA FOR THE GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE TSUNAMI OF NOTHING.
[LAUGHTER]
WE'RE STILL JUST PASSENGERS IN THE BACK OF OBAMA'S CAR/BUS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU SAW THAT, HHUH?
AT MSNBC THEY WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LEAN FORWARD AND HAND OFF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
NATION'S ECONOMIC (bleep) TACO.
>> HE HAS TO GO FIRST AND HE WILL PLEDGED TO THE TEA PARTY I'LL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.
YES, HE WILL, HE MUST.
HE CANNOT GOVERN.
>> ISN'T THE WHOLE ENERGY OF THE TEA PARTY AGAINST JOHN BOEHNER
AND NOT AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.
>> WATCH THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE INTERNALLY IN THEIR PARTY AFTER THIS ELECTION.
THEY'LL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ONES.
>> I CAN SEE THE GLINT IN YOUR EYE AS YOU SAY THAT AND WE HAVE IT HERE, TOO, ABOUT THE TOPIC.
