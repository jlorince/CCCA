[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
REGULAR VIEWERS OF THIS PROGRAM
ARE AWARE THAT WE ARE PLANNING
SOMEWHAT OF A GET-TOGETHER, A
RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY ON
OCTOBER 30th IN THE YEAR OF
OUR LORD 2010 IN WASHINGTON,
D.C.
BUT THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES
WHERE EXACTLY IN WASHINGTON,
D.C.
D.CAN K. IS A RATHER LARGE AND
QUITE FRANKLY POORLY DESIGNED
CITY.
[LAUGHTER]
SERIOUSLY, FOUR UNCONNECTED
EIGHTH STREETS?
IT'S LIKE A NEW YORK AVENUE THAT
FOR SOME REASON JUST TURNS INTO
CONNECTICUT AVENUE FOR NO
APPARENT REASON.
I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING IS...
I'M SURPRISE GRAVITY WORKS DOWN
THERE SOMETIMES.
ANYWAY, WE BELIEVE WE FINALLY
FOUND A SPACE ON THE NATIONAL
MALL THAT SEEMS USEFUL,
SUCCESSFUL AND AT THE SAME TIME
SYNONYMOUS WITH NOTHING ELSE
THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE.
IT'S NOT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL
WHERE THE HISTORIC MARTIN LUTHER
KING SPOKE OR THE HIS STAIRIC
GLENN BECK SPOKE OR WHERE FOREST
FOUND JENNY.
OH, FOREST.
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET, BUT
BECAUSE SHE'S A HIPPIE, GOD
KILLS HER.
[LAUGHTER]
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.
IT'S NOT THE STEPS OF THE
CAPITOL BUILDING WHERE THE
MILLION MAN MARCH WAS HELD OR
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT WHERE
GIANT BIZARRE ROW AND GIANT
SUPERMAN ONCE DUALED FOR
SUPREMACY.
WE WILL RALLY HERE, RIGHT HERE,
THE EAST END OF THE NATIONAL
MALL BETWEEN THIRD STREET AND
SEVENTH STREET.
AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S THE
WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
THERE'S THE REFLECTING POOL.
THERE'S THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
WE'RE IN THE BACK OF ALL THAT.
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, NO HUGE,
ICONIC EVENT HAS EVER TAKEN
PLACE THERE, AND IT'S FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM GROUND ZERO, 206
MILES, FOR US TO HAVE ASH AT THE
EVENT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AS LONG AS HE STAYS ON THE
SOUTHRENMOST PART OF THE STAGE.
SO JOIN US THERE.
AND WHILE YOU'RE PLANNING A
TRIP, CONTRIBUTE TO THE RALLY'S
DESIGNATED CHARITY, THE TRUST
FOR THE NATIONAL MALL.
YOU CAN DO IT BY CLICKING ON
DONATE AT RALLYFORSANITY.COM OR
GO TO NATIONALMALL.ORG AND CLICK
ON CONTRIBUTE.
THE NATIONAL MALL IS AN
INCREDIBLE MONUMENT FOR ALL
AMERICANS.
IT'S IN DESPERATE NEED FOR
REPAIR, ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL OF
US RALLY ON IT.
IT'S THE REASONABLE THING TO DO.
GET READY TO RALLY, AND
REMEMBER, THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S
PLACE, SO TREAT THE MALL WITH
RESPECT, WHICH MEANS DON'T TAKE
ANY PICTURES OF YOURSELVES
PRETENDING THE WASHINGTON
MONUMENT IS YOUR PENIS.
[APPLAUSE]
