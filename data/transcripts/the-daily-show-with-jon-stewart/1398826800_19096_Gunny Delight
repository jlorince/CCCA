WEAPONS HYGIENE FROM THE NRAEXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT THE IN
NO WAY UNDERMEDICATED WAYNE LAPIERRE.

KILLERS WHO SCHEME TO DESTROYEDOUR COUNTRY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: DADDY SCARED.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, I SEE THE NRA HAS CHANGED
ITS MISSION FROM FIREARM SAFETYTO DEFENDING THE ALAMO.
I GUESS THE NRA BELIEVES THATTHE THIN LINE --
[LAUGHTER]-- I GUESS THE NRA BELIEVES THE
THIN LINE BETWEEN CIVILIZATIONAND THUNDER DOME IS AN ARMED
TO CAPACITY CITIZENRY READY TOSTAND UP TO TERRORISTS AND FOR
SOME REASON AS MR. LAPIERRE STATED HATERS.
BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN TOLD MANY,MANY TIMES HATERS GONNA HATE.

ARM YOURSELF AGAINST IMMINENTPHYSICAL THREAT.
>> WHETHER THERE'S THROUGHOBAMACARE, WHETHER IT'S THROUGH
REDEFINING MARRIAGE, YOU NAME ITTHEY ARE COMING AT US.
>> Jon: AND THAT'S WHEN (bleep)GOT WEIRD.
[LAUGHTER]BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THE
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE SUPPORT FORSANE GUN OWNERSHIP GOT MIXED UP
IN THE WHOLE NATIONAL CULTUREWAR MESS.
WHY WOULD YOU BE TALKING ABOUTTHOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AT A GUN
CONVENTION UNLESS YOU THINKSOMEHOW GUNS ARE PART OF THE
SOLUTION TO THESE CULTURALDISAGREEMENTS.
>> THEY THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULDPICK YOUR SOFT DRINK, YOUR SNACK
FOOD, YOUR VICES, YOUR HOMESECURITY SYSTEM, YOUR HEALTH

WE'RE NOT THE SAME COUNTRY.
THE OTHER SIDE IS WINNING.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHY YOU NEED AGUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT, HERE IS WHAT THEY MISSED.
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS WINNINGARE ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW,
PEACEFUL CONTESTS BETWEENCOMPETING VIEWPOINTS AND YOUR
SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE LESS WENEED MORE ELECTABLE
CANDIDATES AND A MORENUANCED VIEWPOINT
AND MORE LOCK AND LOAD MOTHER(bleep).
AND THE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS,YOU KNOW, THE LACK OF
SELF AWARENESS THAT AIN'THELPING.
>> THEY LIKE TO PAINT US ASPARANOID BITTER PEOPLE.
>> NO, NO.
WE ASKED YOU TO PAINT US A SELFPORTRAIT AND THIS IS WHAT YOU
CAME UP WITH.
[ LAUGHTER ]MAYBE WE WOULD FIND YOUR MISSION
LESS PARANOID IF THE VISION OFTHE WORLD YOU PRESENT RESEMBLED
IN ANYWAY THE WORLD.

THE SAFE CARRY PROTECTION ACT.
IT'S GOT THE WORD SAFE IN ITAND GOT THE
WORD PROTECTION IN IT. THATACTUALLY SOUNDS OKAY.
>> CRITICS ARE CALLING IT THEGUNS EVERYWHERE LAW.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THAT SOUNDS WORSE.
[LAUGHTER] JUST OUT OFCURIOSITY, WHERE WILL THIS
SAFE PROTECTIVE CARRYING BETAKING PLACE?
>> WHEN THE LAW GOES INTO EFFECTON JULY 1ST, FIREARMS WILL BE
ALLOWED INSIDE UNSECUREDPUBLIC BUILDINGS LIKE
LIBRARIES AND RECREATIONALCENTERS
AND PARTS OF AIRPORTS THAT LIEOUTSIDE SECURITY CHECKPOINTS.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD YOU TAKE AGUN TO THE AIRPORT?
TRYING TO GET THE ATTENTION OFTHE PERSON YOU ARE PICKING UP.
IT'S OVER HERE AUNT PATTY.

BUT ANYWAY, THAT'S HARDLY GUNSEVERYWHERE.
>> THEY CAN BE BROUGHT INTO BARSAND HOUSES OF WORSHIP, TEACHERS
AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS CANALSO CARRY THEIR GUNS INTO
CLASSROOMS SO LONG AS THEDISTRICT ALLOWS IT.
>> Jon: CLASSROOMS.
IT'S NOT JUST GUN RIGHTS IT'SEDUCATION REFORM.
[ LAUGHTER ]YEAH, HEY YOU WANT TO COME UP
HERE AND SOLVE SIX TIMES NINE?
DO YOU, PUNK?
[LAUGHTER]DO YOU?
[LAUGHTER]DON'T WORRY EVEN GEORGIA'S
DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATUREPUT SOME
COMMON SENSE RESTRICTIONS WHEREGUNS CANNOT GO.
>> THERE IS A GOVERNMENTBUILDING
WHERE GUNS ARE NOT ALLOWEDAND THAT'S THE
STATE CAPITAL.
>> Jon: BOOYA! YOU HEARD THATRIGHT. ONE OF ONLY
PLACES GEORGIA'S LEGISLATURESDIDN'T ALLOW GUNS
IS IN THE BUILDINGWHERE THEY WORK.

YOU DO, WE JUST LIKE TO WATCH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
