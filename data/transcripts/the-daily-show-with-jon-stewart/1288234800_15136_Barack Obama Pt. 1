THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

( LAUGHTER )
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THIS IS A NICE SET.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> IT REMINDS ME OF THE
CONVENTION.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: WE ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT.
IT WAS IN A WAREHOUSE, AND WE
BOUGHT IT.
WE HAD IT CHISELED.
LET ME GIVE YOU MUG FORCE ONE.
THIS IS YOURS.
THERE'S NO WATER IN IT.
LET ME GET SOME WATER FOR YOU.
I'LL GET THAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY.
( LAUGHTER )
THERE YOU GO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DOES THAT HAPPEN TO YOU WHEREVER
YOU GO?
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GUY GOSS TO
WORK, DO PEOPLE... TYPICALLY
APPLAUD?
IT'S A NICE FEELING.
>> IT WAS A WONDERFUL WELCOME.
IT DOES NOT HAPPEN, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHEN I GO TO THE REPUBLICAN
CAUCUS MEETING.
>> Jon: SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: SO HERE YOU ARE.
>> HERE I AM.
>> Jon: YOU'RE TWO YEARS INTO
YOUR ADMINISTRATION.
AND THE QUESTION THAT ARISES IN
MY MIND: ARE WE THE PEOPLE WE
WERE WAITING FOR?
( LAUGHTER )
OR DOES IT... DOES IT TURN OUT
THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT THERE
AND WE DON'T HAVE THEIR NUMBER?
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING
GREAT ABOUT WHERE THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING WHAT
WE'VE GONE THROUGH.
I MEAN, WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE
TWO TOUGHEST YEARS OF ANY TIME
SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND
IN LIGHT OF THAT, THE FACT THAT
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RESILIENT, THAT
FOLKS ARE STILL OUT THERE
WORKING AND OPENING BUSINESSES
AND, YOU KNOW, WORKING IN THE
COMMUNITY, LOOKING AFTER THEIR
FAMILIES, TAKING CARE OF THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES, THAT'S
ENCOURAGING.
SO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF GOOD
STUFF HAPPENING, BUT PEOPLE ARE
FRUSTRATED.
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF FOLKS ARE
HURTING OUT THERE STILL.
AND, YOU KNOW, IN THAT
ENVIRONMENT, I THINK THAT
THEY'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN DO A
LITTLE BIT BETTER HERE IN
WASHINGTON THAN WE'VE BEEN
DOING.
>> Jon: NOW, DO YOU FEEL THAT
AS WELL?
BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING FROM A
PLACE, YOU RAN ON VERY HIGH
RHETORIC, HOPE AND CHANGE, AND
THE DEMOCRATS THIS YEAR SEEM TO
BE RUNNING ON, PLEASE, BABY, ONE
MORE CHANCE.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, HOW DID WE GO IN TWO YEARS
FROM HOPE AND CHANGE, WE ARE THE
PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR,
TO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE
THEM THE KEYS, ARE YOU?
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED IN HOW IT'S
GONE?
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT OTHER
PEOPLE, EVEN YOUR BASE, CAN BE
DISAPPOINTED?
OR DO YOU REJECT THEIR
NARRATIVE?
>> YOU KNOW, LOOK, WHEN I WON
AND WE STARTED THE TRANSITION
AND WE LOOKED AT WHAT WAS
HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY, A
WHOLE BUNCH OF MY POLITICAL
FOLKS CAME UP AND SAID, YOU KNOW
WHAT, ENJOY THIS NOW BECAUSE TWO
YEARS FROM NOW FOLKS ARE GOING
TO BE FRUSTRATED.
AND THIS IS, IN FACT, WHAT'S
HAPPENED.
WHEN YOU HAVE 9.6% UNEMPLOYMENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHEN FOLKS ARE SEEING THEIR
HOMES UNDERWATER, WHEN THE
ECONOMY IS GROWING BUT IS STILL
NOT GROWING AS FAST AS IT NEEDS
TO TO MAKE UP FOR THE EIGHT
MILLION JOBS THAT WERE LOST,
FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE
FRUSTRATED, AND THAT'S GOING TO
REFLECT ITSELF IN THE POLITICAL
ENVIRONMENT, BUT HAVING SAID
THAT, I LOOK OVER THE LAST 18
MONTHS, AND I SAY, WE PREVENTED
THE SECOND GREAT DEPRESSION.
WE'VE STABILIZED THE ECONOMY, AN
ECONOMY THAT WAS SHRINKING IS
NOW GROWING.
WE'VE GOT NINE MONTHS OF
CONSECUTIVE PRIVATE SECTOR JOB
GROWTH.
WE HAVE PASSED HISTORIC HEALTH
CARE REFORM, HISTORIC FINANCIAL
REGULATORY REFORM.
WE HAVE DONE THINGS THAT SOME
FOLKS DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.
>> Jon: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?
( LAUGHTER )
ARE YOU PLANNING A SURPRISE
PARTY FOR US?
FILLED WITH JOBS AND HEALTH
CARE.
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF
MAKING SURE THAT... BEFORE WE
EVEN PASSED HEALTH CARE, FOUR
MILLION KIDS GOT HEALTH
INSURANCE THAT DIDN'T HAVE IT
BEFORE THROUGH THE CHILDREN'S
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
EXPANDED NATIONAL SERVICE MORE
THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THE PEACE CORPS.
MADE SURE THAT CREDIT CARD
COMPANIES COULDN'T JACK UP YOUR
RATES WITHOUT NOTICE.
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE HAVE
MOVED FORWARD AN AGENDA THAT IS
MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S
LIVES EACH AND EVERY DAY.
NOW, IS IT ENOUGH?
NO.
AND SO I EXPECT AND I THINK MOST
DEMOCRATS OUT THERE EXPECT THAT
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE MORE
PROGRESS.
>>
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF THE
FOLKS WHO VOTED FOR ME, MY
EXPECTATION AND HOPE IS THAT IF
YOU LOOK AT THE TRACK RECORD
THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN VERY
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER THE
LAST 18 MONTHS, WE HAVE DONE AN
AWFUL LOT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND WE'RE
GOING TO DO MORE IN THE YEARS TO
COME.
JON JON THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO.
WE'LL TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THAT
PROGRESS IS, WHAT IT WAS, WHAT
THE PR
