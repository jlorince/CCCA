OF COURSE OUR OWN CAIRO BUREAU
CHIEF AASIF MANDVI HAS BEEN IN
TAHRIR SQUARE THROUGHOUT THESE
HISTORIC EVENTS.
THE SCENE THERE MUST BE
ELECTRIFYING
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
.
IF I MAY SAY, THE SCENE IN
TAHRIR SQUARE MUST BE
ELECTRIFYING.
>> WELL IT WAS LAST WEEK.
WHEN I WAS HERE STANDING BY TO
REPORT THE STORY OF A
LIFETIME.
HEY, JON, YOU KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SHOW
AND A NEWS SHOW?
>> Jon: WHAT'S THAT?
>> WELL, WHEN BIG THINGS
HAPPEN CRONKITE WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN OFF THE MOUNTAIN, TOWEL
DRIED AND FLOWN HOME.
>> Jon: WOULD HE HAVE STAYED
TO FINISH HIS TURKEY LEG?
>> NO, HE WOULD NOT.
>> Jon: WE SCHEDULED THE TRIP
A LONG TIME AGO.
LOOK, HAS THE SITUATION REALLY
CHANGED THAT MUCH SINCE LAST
FRIDAY NIGHT?
>> KINDA.
LET'S SEE.
THE ARMY TOOK CONTROL.
SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTION.
DISSOLVED THE PARLIAMENT.
CLEARED THE SQUARE.
OTHER THAN THAT, STATUS QUO.
JON BEFORE YOU LEFT REPORTERS
GOT HASSLED.
NOW THAT YOU'VE COME BACK,
THERE'S NOBODY TO TALK TO.
WHILE YOU WERE GONE, THERE WAS
A SWEET SPOT OF PURE JOY HERE
A TIME WHEN THE ARAB STREET
ROSE UP AND BEGAN KISSING
REPORTERS.
HOISTING THEM ON THEIR
SHOULDERS FOR 48 HOURS HERE
ALL A JOURNALIST NEED TO GET
LOVED UP WAS A LIVE FEED.
BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO SPEND
THE WEEK FILING MY OWN
DISPATCHES IF YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN.
>> Jon: YOU SPENT THE WEEK
MATS
