IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRYING TO
PROCESS OUR LATENT 9/11 GRIEF,
MIXED WITH A CATHARTIC SERATONIN
ECSTASY BATH OF GETTING BIN
LADEN, THE PUNDITS HAVE FINALLY
BEEN ABLE TO CRYSTALLIZE THIS
MOMENT.
>> THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN
LADEN BY U.S. SPECIAL FORCES IS
SUMMER A DEFINING MOMENT FOR
PRESIDENT OBAMA,.
>> A CLOSE-UP OF THE PRESIDENT
IN THE SITUATION ROOM YESTERDAY,
A DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIS
PROCESS.
>> IT COULD BE THE DEFINING
MOMENT IN BARACK OBAMA'S
PRESIDENCY.
>> Jon: IT COULD BE AND IT WILL
BE, UNTIL OBAMA'S
NO-HOLDS-BARRED DEATH MATCH WITH
KIM JONG IL ON THE MOON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MOON FIGHT!
MOON FIGHT!
MOON!
ON THE MOON!
PUNDITS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM
VACILLATED BETWEEN WHETHER THIS
COULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT FOR
OBAMA OR IF IT ABSOLUTELY WAS A
DEFINING MOMENT, SOMETIMES DOING
SO WITHIN THE HEAD OF THE SAME
PERSON.
>> NO DOUBT THE KILLING OF BIN
LADEN WILL BE THE DEFINING
MOMENT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
FIRST TERM, AT LEAST SO FAR.
>> Jon: FIVE MINUTES LATER...
>> WILL KILLING OSAMA BIN LADEN
PROVE TO BE THE DEFINING MOMENT
FOR THIS PRESIDENT?
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: THAT'S CHRIS MATTHEWS,
ASKING HIMSELF THE QUESTION THAT
HE HIMSELF HAD ANSWERED FIVE
MINUTES EARLIER ON HIS OWN
PROGRAM.
( LAUGHTER )
ALTHOUGH, IN HIS DEFENSE,
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP A
THOUGHT IN A HEAD THAT LARGE.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S--
( LAUGHTER )
THERE'S SO MUCH OPEN SPACE FOR
THOUGHTS TO ROAM.
YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY GOT LESS
OF A HEAD, MORE OF A FREE-RANGE
IDEA FARM.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND TO BE FAIR TO THE MEDIA,
GETTING BIN LADEN IS A MOMENTOUS
EVENT, AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A
DEFINING MOMENT OF ANYONE'S
PRESIDENCY.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE MEDIA THROWS A
PHRASE LIKE THAT AROUND FOR
PRETTY MUCH ANY EVENT.
>> THE LAME DUCK SESSION IN
CONGRESS DISTINGUISHES HIS
MOMENT IN HIS PRESIDENCY.
>> COULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT
FOR HIS PRESS AGAINST.
>> EXTENDING THE BUSH-ERA TAX
CUTS-- IS THIS A DEFINING MOMENT
FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA?
>> THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR
THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY.
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A DEFINING
MOMENT FOR HIS PRESIDENCY.
>> I THINK THIS G.M. DECISION IS
ANYTHING TO BE ONE OF THE
DEFINING MOMENTS OF THIS OBAMA
PEREZ DESPERATE.
>> AFGHANISTAN IS THE TOUGHEST
ISSUE HE'S FACED.
>> COULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT
FOR THIS PRESIDENCY?
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: EARLIER TODAY THE
PRESIDENT HAD LUNCH.
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE DEFINING
SANDWICH OR PERHAPS THE YOGURT
SHAKE IS THE PRESIDENCY'S
DEFINING BEVERAGE.
LOOK, ANY ONE OF YOU WITH A
TELEVISION SHOW, ANY ONE OF
THOSE COULD BUILD A MONTAGE IN
THE MEDIA SUGGESTING DIFFERENT
MOMENTS OF THE DEFINING MOMENT
IN OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY.
ONE NEW CASTER BOLD ENOUGH TO
ONLY USE THIS PHRASE TO DESCRIBE
ANYTHING.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU
THE DEFINER.
>> JUST VOTED TODAY TO DENY
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
I MEAN, ISN'T THIS SOMEWHAT OF A
DEFINING MOMENT FOR THE WHITE
HOUSE?
>> WHY IS SOCIAL SECURITY 99 ON
THE TABLE?
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
DEFINING MOMENTS.
>> THIS COULD BE THE DEFINING
MOMENT OF HIS PRESIDENCY.
>> I THINK THIS IS A DEFINING
MOMENT FOR THE PRESIDENT.
>> FOLKS, WE ARE AT A DEFINING
MOMENT IN THIS HEALTH CARE
DEBATE.
>> I VIEW THIS AS A REAL
DEFINING MOMENT.
>> IS THIS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR
PROGRESSIVES?
>> UNLIMITED CORPORATE CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS.
>> I BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFINING
MOMENT.
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A
DEFINING MOMENT IN MINING
HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVES A
SPEECH TOMORROW THAT MAY BE-- I
DON'T KNOW, IS IT THE DEFINING
MOMENT IN HIS FIRST TERM AS
PRESIDENT?
I THINK IT IS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: SLEEP WELL, AMERICA!
KNOW THAT WHILE YOU REST ONE,
MAN IT S OUT THERE MAKING SURE
THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS
OF EQUAL YET URGENT IMPORT.
( LAUGHTER )
DEFINER AWAY.
