REVERSE.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY OUR GREAT BLACK AMERICAN PANEL, SENIOR BLACK MEN TRAITOR, AND WYATT CENAK, LARRY WILMORE.
WATCHING THAT HANNITY PIECE, IT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE SUCH NAKED RACE-BAITING ON TELEVISION.
WHAT IS THAT IN
>> IT'S SOME BULL BELIEF BELIEF.
>> YEAH, HANNITY, YOUR OCTOBER SURPRISE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS BLACK?
>> THEY ARE SOME DESPERATE MOTHER [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT THIS ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY A RELATIVELY MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, LEFT OF CENTER, TECHNOCRAT AS SOME KIND
OF ANGRY BLACK RADICAL?
>> IT'S SOME BULL BELIEF BELIEF.
>> YEAH, BLEEP BLEEP HANNITY.
>> THEY ARE SOME DESPERATE MOTHER [BLEEPED].
JANUARY JON THAT IS THE SAM THING YOU JUST SAID.
DO YOU NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS?
>> NO, JON, WE LOVE BEING PART OF YOUR GREAT BLACK AMERICAN BLACK PANEL OF BLACKS.
BLACK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WOULD IT BE BETTER TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITHOUT THE WHITE GUY MODERATING?
>> NO, JON, THIS IS YOUR SHOW.
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE AND MODERATE THIS BLACK DISCUSSION.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT I'LL BE OVER HERE.
FINE.
I'LL JUST... I'LL READ.

JON, I'VE BEEN SIPHONING GAS FROM YOUR CAR.
♪♪  ♪♪
>> Jon: DID YOU CALL ME?
>> NOPE, NOPE, NOT AT ALL.
>> Jon: I CAN'T HEAR.
>> OKAY, SO HOW DO YOU FEEL?
DOES IT MAKE YOU ANGRY MANY
>> IT'S NOT REALLY ANGRY AS MUCH AS IT'S DEPRESSING.
I MEAN, THIS IS THE SAME DOG-WHISTLE STUFF THEY'VE BEEN PULLING ALL THE TIME, LICE IT'S ACORN AND SHIRLEY SHERROD AND
COMMON AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
IT'S THE SAME STUFF.
>> WAS HE LISTENING TO "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF"?
[LAUGHTER]
>> SERIOUSLY, I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY SAY [BLEEPED] OUT LOUD SOMETIMES.
IT'S JUST DESPERATE.
>> I CAN BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE NO RATIONAL ARGUMENT, YOU HAVE TO BYPASS THAT PART OF THE BRAIN
THAT PROCESSES RATIONAL ARGUMENTS, RIGHT?
YOU JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE REPTILE BRAIN, THE AMYGDALA, AND YOU JUST DOPE IT WITH ENOUGH COATED LANGUAGE AND RACIAL
IMAGERY TO TRIGGER THE FEAR RESPONSE.
>> BY THE WAY, IS THERE A REASON JON CAN'T HEAR THIS CONVERSATION IN
>> NO, PLEASE.
>> WE JUST WANT MORE AIR TIME.
SPEAKING OF, SHOULD WE PROBABLY...

HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL BE SEEN BY PEOPLE WHO READ THE DRUDGE REPORT?
>> I DON'T KNOW, RUN IT THROUGH THE OLD DRUDGEY CAM.
>> Jon: RIGHT, THE LENS WE FILTER ALL THEIR INFORMATION THROUGH.
CAN YOU CUE THAT UP.
>> WE'RE IN YOUR FRONT YARD AND WE'RE STILL MAD ABOUT SLAVERY.
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO BUY CRACK WITH THE FOOD STAMPS YOU'RE PAYING FOR.
>> AND THEN WE'RE GOING THE RAPE YOUR WHITE BABIES.
