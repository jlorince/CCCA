>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TONIGHT SHE'S THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE.
AMBASSADOR --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GREAT HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: DOING VERY WELL.
LAST I SAW YOU, YOU WERE EPITOMIZING THE FOCAL POINT OF OPPOSITION RAGE TOWARDS THE ADMINISTRATION.
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
>> FEELS GOOD TO BE OUT OF THE HOT SPOT.
>> Jon: IT WAS.
SO YOU HAD TO GO ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS ON I GUESS IT WAS SEPTEMBER 16, AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK IN BEN GHAZI
AND -- BENGHAZI.
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?
YOU ARE THE AMBASSADOR OF THE UNITED NATIONSES?
SHOULDN'T IT BE SOMEONE ELSE?
>> ACTUALLY, JON I SPENT MAYBE A SUNDAY DOING THE SHOWS.
SECRETARY CLINTON WAS ASKED TO DO IT.
HAVING BEEN THROUGH QUITE A PRETTY INTENSE WEEK WITH THE LOSS OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN
BENGHAZI, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR EMBASSIES ALL OVER THE ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLD AND THAT FRIDAY
HAVING TO JOIN PRESIDENT OBAMA IN GRIEVING THE FAMILIES OF FALLEN COLLEAGUES AND BRINGING
THEIR BODIES BACK.
I WAS ASKED AS I'VE BEEN IN THE PAST AND I SAID I WOULD.
>> Jon: THEY HAND YOU A -- THEY GIVE YOU A SHEET AND SAY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IS -- IN ALL INSTANCES WHEN YOU PREPARE YOU
GO THROUGH THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS ANT PREP TORY PROCESS.
>> Jon: SO YOU PREPARE FOR THE SUNDAY SHOWS?
>> YES.
>> Jon: I'VE SEEN THE SUNDAY SHOWS.
[LAUGHTER]
SO WHAT WAS THE -- ON THAT DAY, THE BASIC POINT WAS AS FAR AS WE KNOW THIS IS RELATED TO
DEMONSTRATION BASED ON APE -- ON A MOVIE.
WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE EXTREMISTS INVOLVED.
WE DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING YET.
>> I SHARED THE BASIC INFORMATION OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAD.
THEY WERE WRONG IN ONE RESPECT WE LEARNED SUBSEQUENTLY.
WE LEARNED THERE WASN'T A PROTEST.
>> Jon: MANY WERE TESTIFIED.
THEY ARE HOLDING UP HAGEL'S CONFIRMATION BECAUSE THEY WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT
BENGHAZI LIKE WHILE THE PRESIDENT CALL THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WHILE IT WAS GOING ON?
I THINK.
I DID NOT PREPARE FOR THIS SO I'M NOT SURE.
>> YOU KNOW, JON, THERE'S BEEN SOME 20 BRIEFINGS OF MEMBERS AND STAFF.
THERE'S TEN HEARINGS ON THIS TOPIC AND 10,000 DOCUMENTS, MORE THAN 10,000 DOCUMENTS PROVIDED
TO CONGRESS.
THERE'S AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON.
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOU THE PROBLEM?
TOO MANY DOCUMENTS.
>> MAYBE.
>> Jon: HERE IS MY OPINION.
THERE'S AN UNDERCOUNTRY OF WHAT THE -- UNDERCURRENT FROM THE REPUBLICANS THAT SUGGESTS A
MALEVOLENT OF THIS.
HERE IS WHAT STRIKES ME AS ODD.
YOU GET TALKING POINTS ON NOVEMBER 16.
PATREAUS TOLD CONGRESS THE C.I.A. DIDN'T CHANGE THE TALKING POINTS.
WHITE HOUSE AND STATE SAID THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
WHITE HOUSE TOLD THE NEWS CHANGES WERE MADE BECAUSE THEY PT DIDN'T WANT AL QAEDA TIPPED
OFF AND THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SAID THEY MADE THE CHANGES BECAUSE THE AL QAEDA
LINKS WERE TOO TENUOUS.
THEN THEY SAID THE F.B.I. DID IT AND THE MORRELL SAID I DID SAY F.B.I. I DIDN'T MEAN F.B.I. I
MEANT C.I.A. AND THEN PANETTA SAID HE BELIEVED AT THE TIME IT WAS A PREPLANNED TERRORIST
ATAFNLG YOU CAN SEE FOR PEOPLE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION THERE, YES?
>> THERE'S ALWAYS CONFUSION WHEN YOU HAVE A TRAGEDY OF THAT SORT AND AMERICANS ARE KILLED.
THE BIGGER, TRAGEDY, THOUGH, JON, IS WE SPENT ALL OF THESE MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
ORIGIN OF TALKING POINTS WHICH WERE CLEARED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
IN MY OPINION, NOT ENOUGH TIME DOING THE SERVICE WE OWE TO OUR FALLEN COLLEAGUES.
>> Jon: THIS GETS TO MY POINT THOUGH.
THIS GETS TO MY POINT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT.
BUT THIS GETS TO MY POINT.
IN THE LEADUP TO THE TALKING POINTS, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE POURING OVER WHAT YOU ARE GOING
TO SAY?
C.I.A. IS SAYING TAKE OUT THE WORD AL QAEDA PUT IN THE WORD EXTREMISTS.
THERE'S PASSED UP AND DOWN THE CHAIN TO SOLIDIFY WHAT SHOULD BE SAID DURING THAT PERIOD.
THAT BOW CORRECT?
>> YES, REALLY OVER THE WEEKEND.
>> Jon: FASCINATING CONVERSATION.
IT ENDED ABRUPTLY
