>> Jon: BACK HERE, WE'RE TALKINGTO TA-NEHISI COATES AND THE BOOK
IS "BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME."
THAT IS WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT TOREAD ABOUT IS THAT THE
SUBJUGATION OF PEOPLE IS THEDESIGN OF HOW THE COUNTRY
PROSPERED, NOT, AS YOU SAID, THEERROR.
AND EVERYBODY'S OPTIMISM THATIT'S GETTING BETTER IS THE THING
THAT'S DIFFICULT.
I CAN'T REMEMBER IF YOU TALKEDABOUT IN THE THE BOOKS, IF, IT
WAS THE ERIC GARNER CASE ORANOTHER CASE, YOUR SON WAS
DEVASTATED, AND YOU DECIDED TOALLOW HIM TO CRY IN HIS ROOM AND
NOT COMFORT HIM.
>> RIGHT, IT WAS THE MICHAELBROWN CASE.
>> Jon: MICHAEL BROWN.
>> I THOUGHT TO TELL HIM ITWOULD BE BETTER OR OKAY SOMEHOW
THAT THERE WAS SOME MYSTICAL GODOF HISTORY THAT WOULD MAKE
EVERYTHING OKAY FOR HIM, ITHOUGHT THAT WOULD BE TO SEND
HIM OUT IN THE WORLD ILLPREPARED, AND I THINK THAT IS,
LIKE, THE WORST THING.
IT'S THE WORST THING TO HAVE TOFIGURE IT OUT WHEN YOU'RE 25.
IT'S THE WORST THING TO GETKNOCKED UP SIDE THE HEAD BY THE
WORLD AS AN ADULT AND NOT BEREADY.
THE WAY HE FELT AT THAT MOMENT,THOSE ARE THE SORT OF BITTER
PILLS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO DEALWITH AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN
THIS COUNTRY, AND THENUNDERSTANDING THAT, YOU HAVE TO
DECIDE HOW YOU MAKE YOUR PEACE.
HOW YOU FIND YOUR MISSION, HOWYOU FIND YOUR PURPOSE WITHIN
THAT CHAOS.
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT POLICIES ORFAIRYTALES, CAN'T SOFTEN IT OR
PUT HONEY ON TOP OF IT, THIS ISTHE WORLD.
THIS IS THE WORLD.
YOU HAVE TO FIND YOUR MISSION,YOUR PURPOSE, YOUR PLACE WITHIN
THAT.
>> Jon: DO YOU EVER FIND THATBURDEN NOT WITH YOU?
DO YOU EVER MOMENTS WHERE YOUFEEL -- WHERE YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT EITHER FEAR OR WEIGHT?
>> WHEN I'M NOT IN THE COUNTRY.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU'RE NOT INTHIS COUNTRY?
>> YES, BUT I WANT TO BE VERY,VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
WHEN I GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES ANDDON'T FEEL IT, I'M SURE PEOPLE
IN THOSE COUNTRIES FEEL IT.
>> Jon: THAT BRINGS UP ANINTERESTING POINT IS DOES
JUSTICE EXIST IN ANY COUNTRY?
DOES THAT TRUE FEELING OF,,LET'S ALL BUY EACH OTHER A COKE
AND SING A SONG AND HOLD HANDS,YOU KNOW, EVERY COUNTRY HAS ITS
SUBJUGATED PEOPLE THAT IT BUILDSITS WEALTH ON, YES?
>> YES, THAT'S TRUE AND IFTHERE'S ANYTHING OPTIMISTIC AND
POSITIVE IN ME, YOU KNOW, I AMAN AMERICAN AND I DO BELIEVE IN
THE IDEALS WE SAID WE WOULDTHINK ABOUT, AND I THINK HAVING
IDEALS IS A GOOD THING.
I THINK WANTING TO EXCEPTIONALAND HAVING EXCEPTIONALISM AS AN
IDEAL IS A GOOD THING, AND ITHINK IT WOULD BE GOOD THING
TO RECOGNIZE THAT IS TRUEOF HUMAN HISTORY, BUT MAYBE WE
CAN BE A LITTLE BETTER.
MAYBE GENERATION BY GENERATIONWE CAN BE A LITTLE BETTER.
>> Jon: WHAT DOES JUSTICE LOOKLIKE?
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE, THEWORLD THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE --
OR IS THIS A REALISM THAT YOUJUST SEE IT AND IT'S FATALISM?
>> THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION.
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE END OFWHITE SUPREMACY WOULD LOOK LIKE,
BUT I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHATDEEPLY SCARES ME: DO YOU NEED
SOMEONE UNDERNEATH?
DO YOU NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO HAVETHE BOOK ON 14th CENTURY
HISTORY AND THE BOOK SAYSABOUT JEWISH PEOPLE --
>> Jon: YEAH, I READ THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT SAID IF THE JEWS WERENOT THERE, THEY WOULD HAVE
INVENTED THEM, THAT YOU NEEDEDSOMEBODY TO PLAY THAT ROLE.
SO I HOPE THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I DON'T KNOW.
>> Jon: HAS IT EVER EXISTEDWHERE IT WASN'T TRUE?
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN THINK OFA SITUATION WHERE EITHER PEOPLE
WEREN'T SUBJUGATED OR THEY BRINGIN PEOPLE TO SUBJIGATE.
>> RIGHT, BUT WE INVENT SOCIALSYSTEMS, WE INVENT TECHNOLOGY,
WE INVENT DIFFERENT THINGS ALLTHE TIME, RIGHT?
THERE'S NO REASON WE HAVE TOBE-- I DON'T BUY THAT.
I DON'T BUY BECAUSE IT HASN'TEXISTED IT CAN'T.
>> Jon: I CAN'T BELEIVE HOWOPTIMISTIC YOU ARE.
>> YOU GOT ME ALL WRONG!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT I WONDER, LET'S SAYTHE JEWS DIDN'T EXIST AND AND
THEY INVENTED SOMETHING ELSE.
LET'S SAY WHAT WOULD HAVEBEEN -- HERE'S A QUESTION.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ADIFFERENT POSITION AS SUBJIGATOR
RATHER THAN SUBJIGATED.
>> SAME THING.
AND AS I WRITE ABOUT IN THEBOOK, IT'S IMPORTANT --
I AM NOT BEING CLEAR ABOUT THEPEOPLE SAYING THEY'RE WHITE OR
CALLING THEMSELVES WHITE, ALLTHE THINGS WE ASSOCIATE WITH
THAT IDEA HAVE TO DO WITH POWERAND NOT THE FACT OF SKIN COLOR.
YOU OBVIOUSLY AREN'T LITERALLYWHITE.
IT'S DERIVED FROM SOMETHING
>> Jon: IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES,I CAN --
>> I DOUBT IT.
>> Jon: YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS.
>> Jon: NO, IT'S A CONSTRUCT.
IT'S IN SOME WAYS A CONSTRUCT ASARBITRARY AS, I'M A METS FAN,
YOU'RE A YANKEE FAN, AND WEWOULD FIND A WAY TO FIGHT ABOUT
THAT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: IF WE WERE ALL THE SAME,WE WOULD BE, METS FAN, YANKEES
FAN, BUT THAT WOULD BE WAR.
WE SOMEHOW HAVE TO FIND A WAYTO--
>> I'M HOPING THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOKBECAUSE --
(LAUGHTER)
>> I HEARD THINGS ABOUT THAT!
>> Jon: OH, IT'S GOOD.
BUT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THEBOOK IS EVERYBODY EXPECTS A
BOOK, EVERYBODY EXPECTS ASTATEMENT TO BE FINAL, TO
CONCLUDE.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHAT I FEEL LIKE IREAD IN THIS IS YOUR JOURNEY
THROUGH TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITHTHESE ISSUES, THROUGH TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND IT, AND THE OPENINGOF A CONVERSATION.
>> RIGHT.
NO, IT'S NOT FINAL.
>> Jon: THAT SEEMS EXCITING.
>> I HAVE YET TO HEAR SOMEBODYSAY THEY WERE EXCITED ABOUT THIS
BOOK.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
>> Jon: BUT DON'T YOU FEELLIKE IT IS THE ONE CONVERSATION
THAT FEELS LIKE IT COULD HEALMANY THOUSANDS OF BROKEN
HEARTS --
>> LISTEN TO YOU!
>> Jon: I GOT THAT FROM THISBOOK!
BECAUSE I WAS READING THIS BOOKABOUT 14th CENTURY...
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I AM ALSO SMART.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT, NO, IT'S THE ONE THING --
I'M NOT SAYING THAT -- LOOK, INSOUTH AFRICA THEY DIDN'T SELL
APARTHEID TO THE TRUTH ANDRECONCILIATION COMMISSION, BUT
AT LEAST THEY TRIED.
AT LEAST THEY HAD AN HONESTCONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND NOT
PRETEND THAT RACE DIDN'T EXIST.
MAYBE IT'S JUST A HOT-HEAD COP,AN UNENDING SERIES OF HOT-HEAD
COPS.
WHO JUST ALWAYS SEEM TO GETANGRY AS BLACK PEOPLE.
IT SEEMS LIKE AN UNWILLINGNESSTO EVEN ENTERTAIN IT.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I TRY TOGET ACROSS IN THE BOOK IS THIS
NOTION THAT STRUGGLE ISIMPORTANT, WHETHER SUCCESS IS
ASSURED OR NOT.
IT'S WORTH TRYING, EVEN IF YOUTHINK IT WON'T WORK.
I HAVE NO IDEA IF WE CAN LIVE INA WORLD WITHOUT, YOU KNOW,
SUBJUGATION, BUT WHEN THE FINALTALLY COMES UP, I WOULD LIKE TO
SAY I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THEPEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO NOT
LIVE IN A WORLD OF SUBJUGATION,AND I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING
IN THAT, WHETHER YOU, YOU KNOW,THINK THAT OR NOT, I THINK
THAT'S THERE.
>> Jon: I WILL HAVE TO LEAVETHAT BECUASE THAT'S A
BEAUTIFUL SENTIMENT.
