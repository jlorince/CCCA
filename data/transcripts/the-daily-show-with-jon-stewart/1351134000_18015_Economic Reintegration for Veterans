SO BEFORE THE BREAK I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE HILARIOUS STORY OF THOUSANDS OF RETURNING VETERANS NOT HAVING THE CERTIFICATION
THAT CIVILIANS WILL UNDERSTAND, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE CLEARLY GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE WORK REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU WOULD NEED
TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET HERE, SO I FIGURED WE'D DO OUR PART TO HELP REINTEGRATE THEM INTO THE WORKPLACE.
JOINING ME NOW ARE TWO IRAQ VETERAN, FIELD TRAINED MEDICS, MEG MITCHAM AND DANIEL HUTCHINSON.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, MEG, DANIEL.
ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
LET'S GET INTO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
MEG?
>> YEP.
>> DANIEL?
>> YEP.
>> Jon: OKAY.
YOU GUYS SERVED IN IRAQ?
>> YEP.
>> Jon: AND WHAT WAS YOUR JOB IN IRAQ?
>> I WAS A COMBAT MEDIC.
>> Jon: UH-HUH.
DANIEL?
>> I WAS IN IRAQ IN '06.
OUR JOB WAS TO STABILIZE CASUALTIES UNTIL THE POINT WHERE WE COULD GET MEDICAL EVACUATION FOR THEM.
>> Jon: YOURS AS WELL.
>> PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING.
GUY GETS SHOT, WE FIX IT.
>> Jon: WELL, NOW YOU'RE BACK HOME.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK.
WOULD YOU LIKE THE STILL BE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD BY ANY CHANCE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
>> COLUMBUS, OHIO.
>> Jon: WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
WASHINGTON, D.C.
>> I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU'RE FROM OHIO, THE ONLY STATE THAT MATTER.
HERE'S A VOTER REGISTRATION CARD.
PLEASE.
DID YOUR GET THIS?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THEY ALREADY GOT YOU?
YOU WANT TO VOLUNTEER AT ALL?
APPARENTLY IT'S A REQUIREMENT NOW, ANYONE FROM OHIO HAS TO...
SO OHIO AND D.C.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE TWO OPENINGS, SCHOOL NURSE.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN THAT AT ALL?
>> A JOB'S A JOB.
>> Jon: A JOB'S A JOB.
OKAY.
>> CAN I SEE VERY QUICKLY YOUR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE NURSING DEGREE.
>> I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE.
>> Jon: OH.
WELL, HOW ABOUT THE RESULTS OF YOUR NATIONAL COUNCIL LICENSING EXAM?
>> I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE EITHER.
>> Jon: WELL, WE NEED OUR PEOPLE TO BE FAMILIAR WITH BIOLOGY, ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.
>> GOT THAT.
>> Jon: WHAT WERE SOME OF YOUR EXPERIENCES?
>> YOU SEE, I WAS OVER WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS IN IRAQ, AND WE WERE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.
BIG BOMB WENT OFF, BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOT INJURED.
SO I USED THE RESOURCES THAT I HAD AT THE TIME TO SAVE LIVES OF THREE PATIENTS AT THE SAME TIME, STOP THEIR BLEED, CALL IN A
MEDIVAC REQUEST AND ENSURE THAT THEY WERE KEPT ALIVE AND SAFE UNTIL THEY COULD GET TO A HIGHER ECHELON OF CARE AT ONE OF THE
HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTRY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE A CERTIFICATION THAT SAYS THAT YOU DID ALL THIS?
>> I AM MY AMT BASIC LICENSE, WHICH IS SOME OF THAT.
>> Jon: AND THAT CERTIFIES DO YOU DO WHAT?
>> TAKE VITAL SIGNS.
>> Jon: SCHOOL NURSE.
>> LET'S DO IT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU'D LIKE THE JOB?
>> YES.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE A PROFESSIONAL PUPIL SERVICES LICENSE.
>> I DO NOT.
>> Jon: ISSUED BY THE OHIO LICENSING BOARDMENT
>> I DO NOT.
>> Jon: WHAT EXPERIENCE DO YOU HAVE IN THIS FIELD?
>> I'VE STABILIZED GUYS WITH A WOUND IN HIS CHEST, REPLENISHED FLUIDS, BREATHED FOR HIM FOR 37
MINUTES UNTIL WE COULD GET A BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER TO GET HIM TO THE NEXT ECHELON OF CARE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH KICKBALL?
[LAUGHTER]
IN THE JOB THAT I'M ASKING OF YOU, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH BRUISING.
WERE THERE TUMMY ACHES WERE YOU WERE?
>> WE HAD TUMMY ACHES IN IRAQ.
>> Jon: SO YOU ARE NOT IN ANY WAY LICENSED OR QUALIFIED TO WORK AS A SCHOOL NURSE?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
THE ONLY CERTIFICATION I HAVE IS AN EMT BASIC.
>> Jon: NOW, BUT YOU CLEARLY BOTH HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TRAINING FAR ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT ANY OF THESE JOBS
WOULD REQUIRE AND ALSO SEEM TO HAVE, AND I RECOGNIZE THIS BEFORE IN PEOPLE AND I DON'T NECESSARILY RECOGNIZE IT IN
MYSELF, COURAGE AND INTEGRITY.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH I FIND EMPLOYERS TEND TO VALUE.
SO WHAT IS THE DISCONNECT?
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE THAT IS NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE THAT ARE CLEARLY QUALIFIED, INTELLIGENT, TENACIOUS, HARD-WORKING AND
COURAGEOUS TO NOT GET THE JOBS THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY QUALIFIED FOR.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE?
>> I THINK BETWEEN WHAT WE LEARN IN THE FORMAL TRAINING AND WHAT WE LEARN IN THE FIELD AND ON THE
JOB HANDS ON JUST DOING IT BECAUSE IT HAPPENS AND SO YOU FIX IT, BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS, WE DON'T GET THE
CERTIFICATION THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING FOR.
>> Jon: HOW ABOUT YOU?
>> I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO MAJOR BREAKDOWNS.
FIRST ONE IS WE NEED A BETTER TRANSITION PROGRAM IN PLACE FOR OUR RETURNING VETERANS WITH BIG EMPHASIS ON RESUME WRITING.
A VETERAN CAN TAKE HIS JOB SKILLS THAT HE DID IN THE MILITARY AND TRANSLATE IT INTO A WAY CIVILIAN EMPLOYERS CAN UNDERSTAND.
AND THE SECOND, I BELIEVE MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD COME HOME WITH CERTIFICATIONS.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME JOB YOU DID IN THE MILITARY.
YOU CAN DO IT IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD.
>> YOU SAY YOU HAVE AN EMT BASIC.
YOU CLEARLY WOULD QUALIFY FOR AN EMT PARAMEDIC, WOULD YOU NOT?
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING, SAVING LIVES IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.
>> WE'RE PRACTICING AT THAT LEVEL.
WE PRACTICE MEDICINE AT THAT LEVEL WITHOUT THE CERTIFICATION.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU GET BACK, THEY WANT TO PUT YOU BACK THROUGH TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE TWO YEARS LONG,
HUNDREDS OF HOURS AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.
I HATE TO BE ARCH ABOUT IT, BUT IT IS SOMEWHAT STUNING TO SEE PEOPLE OF YOUR QUALIFICATIONS AND YOUR TALENTS HAVE TO
STRUGGLE WITH THE SYSTEM THAT SHOULD DO NOTHING MORE THAN RESPECT AND HONOR ALL THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO IT.
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FORMER STAFF SERGEANT MEG MITCHAM AND FORMER SPECIALIST DANIEL HUTCHINSON.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
