[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST
TONIGHT, HE IS THE PRESIDENT OFTHE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM HADI AL BAHRA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THESYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION.
WHAT, WHAT IS THAT?
AND IS THAT -- BECAUSE IT IS,WE'RE AWFULLY CONFUSED.
AND BY THE WAY, SORRY FORDESTABILIZING THE WHOLE REGION.
BUT WHAT IS THE SYRIAN NATIONALCOALITION?
WHAT IS IT MADE UPOF?
>> THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITIONIS SIMPLY PROUD SYRIANS WHO
SEEK THEIR JUSTICE TO REGAINTHEIR RIGHTS, THEIR FREEDOM, AND
TO HAVE THEIR COUNTRY WITHDEMOCRATIC RULERSHIP.
>> Jon: YOUR GOAL IS NOT JUSTTHE DEFEAT OF THIS NEW
TERRORIST GROUP, THISISIL, THIS ISIS.
WHATEVER THEY CALL THEMSELVES.
YOUR GOAL IS ALSO TO GAINJUSTICE FROM ASSAD.
>> IT IS TRUE.>> Jon: YES.
>> ASSAD IS THE SOLE CAUSE OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN
THE AREA. THIS HAS BEEN SINCETHE 80S SINCE
THE INVASION OF LEBANON BY THESYRIAN ARMY.
SINCE THE PRESENCE OF THEAMERICAN FORCES IN IRAQ.
THE ORIGIN OF ISIS ORGANIZATION,IT WAS THE STATE, THE ISLAMIC
STATE OF IRAQ AND IT WASCARRYING TERRORIST ATTACKS
AGAINST AMERICAN FORCES IN IRAQAT THAT TIME.
AGAIN HE INVESTED AND REBUILTTHIS SAME ORGANIZATION TO
TERRORIZE THE SYRIAN PEOPLE NOWIN ORDER TO BLOCK
THEIR FREE MOVEMENT FOR FREEDOMAND DEMOCRACY.
>> Jon: ASSAD DID THAT. BECAUSEOUR UNDERSTANDING OF ISIS
IS THAT THEY WERE FIGHTINGASSAD. THAT THEY WERE, ALONG
WITH THE AL-NUSRAFRONT AND THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY
WERE ALL FIGHTING TOGETHER, ORNOT NECESSARILY TOGETHER
BUT TO TRY TO DEFEAT ASSAD.
>> OPPOSITE.>> Jon: OPPOSITE.
>> ASSAD NEVER FOUGHT ISIS. ISISNEVER FOUGHT ASSAD.
SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR ANDTHE START OF THE PRESENCE OF
ISIS INSIDE SYRIA. ACTUALLY,ISIS FOUGHT ONLY THE FREE SYRIAN
ARMY. AND ASSAD HAS BOMBED,CARRIED THE AIR STRIKES
AGAINST THE FREE SYRIAN ARMYWHILE LEAVING TOTALLY ISIS
FORCES OUT. GO GOOGLE IT OUT.
SEE HOW MANY AIR RAIDS AGAINSTISIS CARRIED BY ASSAD'S REGIME
SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR.YOU'LL FIND NOTHING.
ALL THE STRIKES ARE AGAINSTCIVILIANS, AGAINST PEOPLE
INSIDE ALEPPO, USINGTNT BOMBS, AND USING EXTREME
VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE.
>> Jon: I'M A LITTLE SAD WEDON'T KNOW THAT HERE AND
THAT WE COULD GOOGLE IT AND THENWE WOULD KNOW IT.
THAT'S A LITTLE SAD.
SO IF, WHY WOULD ASSAD WHO ISESSENTIALLY, THIS IS THE ALAWITE
KINGDOM, AND HE IS SUPPORTED BYIRAN.
WHY WOULD HE UNLEASH A SUNNIFUNDAMENTALIST TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION.
WOULDN'T THEY BE HIS MORTALENEMY?
>> NO. HE WANTED FROM THE STARTOF THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION.
HE HAD A STRTEGY AND PLAN. HEWANTED THE FREE WORLD TO
SEE THAT IT'S ONLY A CHOICEBETWEEN AN EVIL TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION AND AN EVILDICTATORSHIP.
AND HE ASSUMED THE WORLD WOULDCHOOSE THE LESSER OF THE TWO
EVILS, AND THEY WOULD CHOOSEASSAD TO COOPERATE WITH.
LUCKILY THE FREE WORLD REFUSEDTO DO THIS, AND THEY UNDERSTOOD
THE GAME AND THEY STOOD BYTHE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
>> Jon: ARE YOU CONCERNED.
WHAT CHANCE, YOU KNOW, I THINKTHE SYMPATHIES OF THE WORLD
ARE WITH THIS COALITIONOF PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT
FREEDOM, THEY JUST WANT TOBE LEFT ALONE, THEY JUST WANT TO
LIVE THEIR LIVES.
HOW DO YOU COMBAT, ASSAD ISBACKED BY IRAN.
AND IN SOME WAYS BACKED BYRUSSIA.
ISIS, ISIL IS BACKEDBY MAYBE ASSAD.
MAYBE THEY'RE GETTING MONEYFROM SOME OF THE OTHER
MORE FUNDAMENTALISTREGIMES IN THE AREA.
HOW IS A GROUP LIKE THIS GOINGTO DEFEAT THEM AND CREATE
SOMETHING STABLE?
>> MAINLY BY OUR WILL AND OURPATIENCE.
THIS IS THE FUTURE OF OURKIDS, OF OUR GRAND DAUGHTERS
AND SONS.
WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THEM SINCE40 YEARS.
AND THE WORLD HAS KEPT SILENT.NOBODY MOVED. THEY MOVED ONLY
AGAINST ISIS WHILE THEY DIDN'TMOVE AND DO ANYTHING FOR ASSAD.
BUT WE THE PEOPLE OF SYRIAWILL CARRY ON OUR FIGHT AND WILL
FIGHT UNTIL WE WIN BACK OURFREEDOM AND WILL ACHIEVE OUR
QUEST INTO A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: HOW WOULD YOU -- AND I
WISH YOU VERY WELL WITH THAT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SO NOW ACOLLISION HAS FORMED THAT THEY
ARE GOING TO DO STRATEGIC AIRSTRIKES THAT THEY BELIEVE
WILL WEAKEN ISIS. WILL THEYWEAKEN THEM TO THE EXTENT
THAT -- IS THIS SOME SORT OFROUND ROBIN?
DOES THE FREE SYRIANSHAVE TO FIGHT AND
DEFEAT ISIS AND THEN TAKE ONASSAD?
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THECOALITION IS UNWILLING
TO UTILIZE THEIR POWERAGAINST ASSAD.
>> WELL IT'S UH, OUR AMERICANFRIENDS, THEY HAVE TO KNOW WE
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS SINCETHE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR.
WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TWOFRONTS.
WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS ANDTHE REGIME, ASSAD REGIME AT THE
SAME TIME WITH VERY LITTLEHELP OF THE WORLD.
WE CAN NOT CARRY ON THE FIGHT OFTWO FRONTS AT THE SAME TIME
WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF OURFRIENDS IN THE U.S. AND
OTHER FREE WORLD.
>> Jon: YOU ARE HERE FOR THEU.N. MISSION. ARE YOU GETTING
THE HELP THAT YOU THINK YOU NEEDAND THAT YOUR PEOPLE DESERVE?
>> I THINK THAT THE WORLD HASSTARTED TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION. IT'S NOT TO OUREXPECTATION AS OF YET.
BUT I THINK SLOWLY IT WILL BUILDUP TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION.
THEY NEED TO NOTICETHAT THEY CANNOT ELIMINATE
TERRORISM BY ONLY MILITARYOPERATIONS.
IT HAS TO BE MUCH, MUCH MORETHAN MILITARY OPERATIONS.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SOCIAL,POLITICAL PROGRAM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU NEED TO PROVIDE A VISIONFOR POLITICAL LIFE FOR ALL
OF THE REGION IN THE MIDDLEEAST.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S THEFASCINATING PART.
SO LET'S, CAN YOU STICK AROUNDFOR A LITTLE BIT?
>> SURE.
>> Jon: WE WILL COME BACK ANDTHEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
COULD WORK THERE BECAUSE IT'SSOMETHING THAT I THINK AMERICA
THOUGHT THEY TRIED IN IRAQ, WERENOT SUCCESSFUL WITH IT.
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING INAFGHANISTAN, WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL
WITH.
SO WHAT A WORLD LIKE THAT WOULDLOOK LIKE, I THINK THAT WOULD BE
IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT, TODELINEATE.
ALRIGHT, SO WE WILL BE RIGHTBACK. HADI AL-BAHRA.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
