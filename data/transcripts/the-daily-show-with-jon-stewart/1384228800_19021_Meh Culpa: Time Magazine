LISTEN!
I'LL SAY THIS FOR "60 MINUTES--"AS HALF-ASSED AS IT WAS, AT
LEAST THEY ADMITTED THEY WEREWRONG AND APOLOGIZED.
IT'S MORE THAN I CAN SAY FORANOTHER JOURNALISTIC ICON.
>> "TIME" MAGAZINE RELEASES ITSLATEST ISSUE THAT
HAS CHRIS CHRISTIE ON THE COVER.
THE HEADLINE IS "THE ELEPHANT INTHE ROOM."
>> Jon:  OH, I GET IT!
BECAUSE HE'S LARGE!
HE'S A LARGE MAN!
HA-HA!
THAT MUST HAVE GIVEN YOURREADERS A GOOD LAUGH, WHETHER
THEY ENCOUNTERED YOUR MAGAZINEWHILE WAITING TO SEE A
GASTROENTEROLOGIST OR USINGTHEIR GRANDPARENTS' BATHROOM.
I GUESS WE SHOULD GIVE "TIME"MAGAZINE CREDIT FOR TONING DOWN
THE ORIGINAL COVER VERSION.
THAT'S NOT EVEN A PLAY ON WORDS,NOTHING EVEN CLEVER ABOUT IT.
WHY THE FAT JOKE TIME?
>> "THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM."
DOES THIS MAKE FUN OF A SERIOUSISSUE?
>> NOT IN OUR MINDS AT ALL.
WE REALLY-- IT'S A-- IT'S AFIGURE OF SPEECH, AND THAT'S
REALLY HOW WE MEAN IT TO BEINTERPRETED.
>> Jon:  I MEAN, IT'S JUST AFIGURE OF SPEECH.
ALL WE DID WAS BLOW UP A GIANTPICTURE OF CHRIS CHRISTIE'S HEAD
IN PROFILE, LIPS AGAPE ASIF BEGGING TO BE HOT DOGGED...
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
AND WE JUXTAPOSED THAT WITH THEIDEA OF THE LARGEST LAND MAMMAL
IN EXISTENCE.
IF YOU INTERPRET THAT AS A FATIF YOU INTERPRETED THAT AS A FAT
JOKE, WELL THAT IS ON YOU.
( LAUGHTER )SO THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
CHRISTIE'S SIZE?
>> HE'S A BIG GUY, AND IT'SNOT JUST ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL
SIZE.
IT'S ABOUT HIS WHOLE POLITICALACT.
>> HE'S, OBVIOUSLY, A BIG GUY.
HE'S, OBVIOUSLY, A BIGREPUBLICAN, BUT HE'S ALSO DONE A
REALLY HUGE THING HERE THISWEEK.
>>YOU'RE STILL ZINGING THEGUY!
THAT'S NOT AN APOLOGY.
YOU'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON HIM.
HE'S A GIGANTIC FIGURE-- HISINFLUENCE IS COMICALLY OVER-- HE
IS-- HE IS MORBIDLY IMPORTANT.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING.
>> TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME,"TIME" MAGAZINE.
THE COVER OF "DAILY SHOW"MAGAZINE THIS WEEK IS A FIGURE
OFSPEECH ABOUT HOW "TIME"
PROCESSES INFORMATION, DIGESTSIT, AND THEN LEAVES ITS INSIGHTS
TO ITS READERS TO PICK THROUGH.
( LAUGHTER )IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
