GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK PAUL
PALADINO HE HAS ABE VGODA'S
BEDROOM EYES.
THERE'S ALSO THIS.

ASSOCIATES CONTAIN RACIST JOKES,
PORN AND BESTIALITY.
>> Jon: OH, RACIST JOKES, PORN
AND BESTIALITY, I WAS TOLD THIS
WAS GOING BE A TEA PARTY.
OOOOH I DIDN'T KNOW THEY
(bleep) HORSES AT TEA PARTY.
[LAUGHTER]
HE HAD A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR
THE RAUNCHY E-MAILS.
>> I FORWARDED E-MAILS.
I'M IN THE CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRY.
I GET A LOT OF THIS WILL JUNK
SENT TO ME.
>> Jon: THAT IS BROADS BANGING
HORSES.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOT
PERIOD TO IT OUT?
WHAT PART OF THE I'M IN THE
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DO YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND IN HUH?
THE OTHER VICTORY IS IN DELAWARE
WHERE CHRISTINE O'DONNELL WAS
THE QUEEN OF DELAWARE REPUBLICAN
MIKE -- SHE PAWNED HIM.
LET'S MEET HER.
>> IT'S MORE OF A CAUSE THAN THE
CAMPAIGN AND THE CAUSE IS
RESTORING AMERICA.
>> Jon: MMMMM, THE PALIN IS
STRONG IN THIS ONE.
MMMMM.
MY GOD JUST GIVE HER BANGS AND A
PAIR OF RIMMED GLASSES AND SHE'D
BE A DEAD RINGER OH, MY GOD!
NO WHICH ONE IS BRIDGET FONDA.
WHICH ONE IS JENNIFER JASON
LEESM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING
ON.
YOU HAVE BESTIALITY E-MAILS.
GOOD LUCK PINNING ANYTHING ON
SNOW WHITE OVER HERE.
>> LUST IN YOUR HEART IS COMMIT
AGRICULTURERY.
YOU CAN'T MAY HAVE THER BAIT
WITHOUT LUST.
YOU ARE PLEASING EACH OTHER.
HE KNOWS WHAT PLEASES HIM AND HE
CAN PLEASE HIMSELF THEN WHY AM I
IN THE PICTURE?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE,
MY DEAR BECAUSE AS OSCAR WILDE
ONCE SAID, "I CAN'T REACH IT
WITH MY MOUTH."
BOOM!
OW!
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME
FROM.
I WONDER HOW DEMOCRATS ARE
REACTING TO THIS SLATE OF
REPUBLICAN NEW BLOOD.
THIS SAY BOON FOR DEMOCRATS TO
HAVE THESE FAR RIGHT WING
CANDIDATES THERE.
>>S A HUGE SWING TO THE RIGHT
AND THEY ARE GOING TO SAY WE
DON'T WANT TO GO WAY OVER THERE.
>> WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A SUPER
CHANCE TO WIN.
>> Jon: THE DEMOCRATS WITH THE
GIDDY EXPECTATIONS OF SCHOOL
CHILDREN TO ARRIVE WITHOUT THEIR
HOMEWORK TO REALIZE THE TEACHER
HAS BEEN IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.
FOR MORE ON THIS STORY WE'RE
JOINED BY OUR POLITICAL EXPERTS.
HERE THEY ARE JOHN OLIVER, WYATT
CENAC.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GIDDY AT THIS
TURN OF EVENTS.
THEY ARE SO EXCITED.
THEY ARE CONVINCED THEY'VE
GUARANTEED THEMSELVES A HOLD ON
THE SENATE.
LOU THEY (bleep) THIS WILL UP,
WYATT CENAC?
>> JON, I THINK DEMOCRATS WILL
(bleep) THIS UP THROUGH
COMPLACENCY, A CLASSIC SCOTT
BROWN MASSACHUSETTS SITUATION
WHEN HIS DEMOCRATIC AND HEAVILY
FAVORED OPPONENT MARTHA COAKLEY
BEARED BOTHERED TO CAMPAIGN.
>> WHEN ASKED WHY ALL THE
BACKROLL ROOM DEALINGS SHE SAID
AS OPPOSED TO STANDING OUTSIDE
FENWAY PARK IN THE COLD, SHAKING
HANDS?
>> SHAKE HANDS BEFORE I WIN SNOW
IN THESE ARE ANY MOST ELECTION
HIGH FIVE HANDS.
>> I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
I THINK DEMOCRATS WILL (bleep)
THIS UP BY MISSING THE POINT.
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR
SENATE IN DELAWARE O'DONNELL IS
RUNNING TO RESTORE FISCAL SANITY
TO WASHINGTON YET LEAVES BEHIND
A TRAIL OF UNPAID BILLS AND
LEGAL ISSUES.
THE DEMOCRATS WILL SPEND ALL
THEIR TIME RIDICULING HER FOR
OPPOSING MASTERBATION.
I ASSUME HOPING FOR A HIGH
TURNOUT OF THE PROMAY HAVE THER
BASING CROWD.
>> GOOD G- LUCK TURNING OUT THE
MASTURBATEOR VOTE.
>> NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A LINGERIE
COMMERCIAL IS COMING ON.
>> Jon: THAT IS WHAT KILLED
MONDEAL AGAINST REAGAN.
>> YOU FORGET THAT THE DEMOCRATS
ARE A DYNAMIC INNOVATIVE PARTY
CONSTANTLY THINKING OF NEW WAYS
TO (bleep) UP A SURE THING.
I BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS WILL TRY
TO USURP THE TEA PARTY'S
FOLKIESINESS BY THROWING A FUND
RAISER WITH SEAN PENN DINING ON
DIAMOND CRUSTED MAHI MAHI WHILE
THE EAGLE THEY RENTED ATTACKED
SCHOOL CHILDREN FORCING THE
CAN'T LOSE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
TO BEAT THAT BALD EAGLE TO DEATH
IN FRONT OF LIVE TELEVISION
CAMERAS WITH THE NEWEST LARGE
BOOK HE CAN FIND WHICH IS --
>> Jon: DON'T SAY IT.
>> YOU KNOW IT.
A KORAN.
>> Jon: I COULD SEE THAT
COMING A MILE AWAY THAT IS GOING
TO BE AN AWESOME WAY TO
(bleep) THIS UP.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WYATT CENA
