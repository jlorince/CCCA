>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THESHOW.
YOU KNOW WE COVER A LOT OF BADNEWS. BUT LET'S LOOK AT
SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD ABOUTAMERICA.
FROM THE GREAT STATE OFMINNESOTA.
>> COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS WEREON THE GROUND IN THEIR
NEIGHBORHOODS CANVASSING TOENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET OUT
AND VOTE.
ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS,THE WOMAN YOU SEE HERE IN
THE PURPLE HOODIE SWEATSHIRTIS MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR BETSY
HODGES.
SHE'S POSING FOR A PHOTOWITH ANOTHER VOLUNTEER NAMED
NAVELL GORDON.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT ISAWESOME, IT'S GRASSROOTS
DEMOCRACY AT ITS FINEST.
OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
>> THIS IS A PHOTO OFMINNEAPOLIS MAYOR BETSY
HODGES ARM IN ARM WITH A MANFLASHING WHAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TELLUS A KNOWN GANG SIDE FOR A
NORTH SIDE GANG.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT'S A GANG SIGN.
ALL THIS TIME I'VE BEEN THELEAD IN FOR A NOTORIOUS
GANG MEMBER.
(LAUGHTER)TERRIBLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S IT! IDON'T WANT THAT GANG MEMBER,
I WANT THAT GUY GONE BY THEEND OF THE YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)ANYWAY, KTSP EYE WITNESS NEWS 5
HAS TAKEN THIS STORY VERYSERIOUSLY.
>> TONIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENTSOURCES ALERTED US TO A
PHOTO THAT HAS THEM FUMINGOVER THE ACTIONS OF
MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR BETSY HODGES.
>> THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY THEMAYOR WOULD TAKE A PICTURE
WITH A CONVICTED CRIMINALWHILE HE AND THE MAYOR FLASH
GANG SIGNS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I THINK IT'S
OBVIOUS.
IT'S TO WARN CLOWN ASS BITCHES,NOT TO SNITCH.
(LAUGHTER)I ASSUME.
IT'S JUST NOT ASENTENCE I SAY A LOT.
HOW ON EARTH CAN THE MAYOR'SOFFICE EXPLAIN THIS BLATANT
ENDORSEMENT OF CRIMINALACTIVITY?
>> A SPOKESPERSON CONCLUDESBY SAYING QUOTE SHE AND THE
MAN IN THE PHOTO ARE JUSTPOINTING AT ONE ANOTHER TO
WHICH THE HEAD OF THE POLICEUNION SAYS SHE'S BEEN AROUND
LONG ENOUGH, SHE KNOWSBETTER.
>> Jon: COME ON!
SHE HAS HELD ELECTIVE OFFICESINCE 2005.
WHEREAS POINTING AS AGESTURE ONLY GOES BACK TO
LITERALLY THE VERY FIRSTFORM OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION.
BY THE WAY, THAT OF COURSE-- NO,DO NOT ENCOURAGE NOTORIOUS
GANG KINGPIN HUGGIE D.
ALRIGHT, SO MAYOR BETSYHODGES WAS DOING VOTER
REGISTRATION WORK WITH A MANWHO WASN'T IN A GANG AND WAS
BRAZENLY FLASHING A NOT-GANGSIGN.
SO HOW DID THIS GET PAINTEDAS A GANG THING?
>> ONE MONTH AGO SHE TOOK ASTRONG POSITION ON LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITYRELATIONS.
SHE WROTE THIS IN AN OPENLETTER TO THE COMMUNITY.
>> QUOTE SOME OFFICERS ABUSETHE TRUST THAT IS AFFORDED
TO THEM.
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIRROLES TO DO HARM RATHER THAN
PREVENT IT.
>> OH, I GET WHAT THIS ISABOUT.
THIS ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THEMAYOR FLASHING THIS SIGN AT A
SUPPOSED GANG MEMBER,AS IT IS ABOUT THE POLICE UNION
FLASHING THIS SIGN AT THEMAYOR.
ANYWAY, THE COPS ARE MAD.
BECAUSE THE MAYOR CRITICIZEDTHEIR CONDUCT.
SO WHEN THEY CAME ACROSS THISPICTURE THEY TOLD EVERYONE
THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THISPICTURE.
WHICH MEANS UNFORTUNATELY,IT'S TIME TO ONCE AGAIN
UPDATE OUR LIST OF INNOCENTTHINGS BLACK PEOPLE DO THAT
LOOK SUSPICIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
HERE WE GO.
DON'T WEAR A HOODIE, DON'TCARRY SKITTLES.
DON'T CARRY KEYS, DON'TREACH FOR A WALLET.
DON'T DRIVE IN A CAR IN ANICE NEIGHBORHOOD.
DON'T DRIVE IN A CAR.
DON'T BE A PASSENGER IN ACAR.
DON'T KNOCK ON A WHITEPERSON'S DOOR.
AND NOW DON'T POINT.
WHICH OF COURSE FOR GOD'SSAKES MEAN BLACK PEOPLE,
WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAYFROM SPORTING EVENTS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
