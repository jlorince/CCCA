>> John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
I'M JOHN OLIVER.
JON STEWART, JON STEWART, I'M
AFRAID, IS STILL NOT HERE.
WORD IS THAT HE HAS BEEN
KIDNAPPED AND TRAPPED IN A CAVE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONSTRUCTING
HIS OWN IRON MAN SUIT.
( LAUGHTER )
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, CURRENTLY
HEAD COACH OF THE EGYPTIAN
NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM, BOB
BRADLEY WILL BE WITH US AND
AMAZING STORIES, AMAZING STORIES
TO TELL.
LET'S START TONIGHT, THOUGH
WNEWS FROM THE GAME MONOPOLY,
WHERE BIG CHANGES ARE AFOOT.
>> THEY'RE TAKING THE JAIL OUT
OF THE MONOPOLY GAME.
>> BOOO!
>> John: YOU HEARD RIGHT.
THE GAME DESIGNED TO TEACH
CHILDREN HOW CAPITALISM WORK HAS
REMOVED THE "GO TO JAIL" OPTION
TO REFLECT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
THEY'RE GOING TO GROW UP IN,
PRESUMABLY REPLACING IT WITH A
"GET IDEAL AT BY CONGRESS AND
THEN GO DIRECTLY TO THE CAYMEN
ISLANDS" OPTION.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
ALSO, ALSO THIS WEEK, WE
ACTUALLY HAVE NEWS FROM THE REAL
FINANCIAL SECTOR.
>> THE BIG STORY THIS QUARTER
HAS BEEN FINANCIAL STOCKS, THE
BANK STOCKS ALL HAD SPECTACULAR
NUMBERS.
HERE'S GOLDMAN SACHS, BY THE
WAY, WHICH HAD AN ABSOLUTELY
TERRIFIC EARNINGS REPORT.
>> PROFITS DOUBLE AT GOLDMAN
SACHS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO
$1.93 BILLION.
>> John: YES, GOLDMAN SACHS
HAVE BEEN COVERING THEIR
INVESTORS IN GOLDMAN SHOWERS.
AS AN INTERESTING SIDENOTE HERE,
ONE OF THE REASONSES THAT
GOLDMAN IS DOING SO WELL IS ITS
TRADE IN ALUMINUM.
AS OF I WILL INCORRECTLY
PRONOUNCE IT FOR YOUR COMFORT,
ALUMINUM.
FOR YEARS, ALUMINUM HAS HELPED
BUILD OUR AIRPLANES.
IT'S KEPT US FROM SIPPING BEER
OUT OF OUR HANDS.
AND PROVIDED MUCH-NEEDED
HEADGEAR FOR OUR CRAZY PEOPLE.
( LAUGHTER ).
BUT WALL STREET'S DARLING HAS
WORKED OUT THAT THERE IS GOLD IN
THAT THERE ALUMINUM.
>> HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TIMES
A DAY, THIRSTY AMERICANS OPEN A
CAN OF SODA, BEER, OR JEES
EXPEMP TIME THEY DO IT, THEY PAY
A FRACTION OF A PENNY MORE
BECAUSEAVE SHREWD MANEUVER BY
GOLDMAN SACHS.
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
REPORTING OVER THE WEEKEND THAT
GOLDMAN SACHS IS RUNNING A
SCHEME TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE
ALUMINUM PRICES.
>> John: THAT SCHEME-- TO
MARRY AN ELDERLY ALUMINUM
HEIRESS AND MURDER HER FOR HER
MONEY.
SO GOLDMAN SACHS IS RUNNING THE
CLASSIC REYNOLD WRAP GRIST ON
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH MEANS
IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER
INSTALLMENT OF JOHN OLIVER'S
DETAILS OF FOREIGN METAL PRICING
UPDATE.
WAIT, WAIT!
DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL!
I PROMISE THIS STORY IS WORTH
LISTENING TO.
MAYBE WE CAN JUST JUICE UP THE
OPENING A BIT.
♪ ♪ ♪
>> JOHN OLIVER'S ARCANE DETAILS
OF BORON GROUP METAL PRICING
UPDATE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> John: HEAVY METAL WHAT, IS
TECHNICALLY CLASSED AS LIGHT
METAL.
AHHH!
NO, SAX HAS TWO-- GOLDMAN SACHS
HAS TWO SEPARATE VENTURES IN
ALUMINUM.
HAD OANS WAREHOUSE WHERE
ALUMINUM IS STORED AND ALSO
TRADES ALUMINUM.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT
HAPPENS NEXT.
>> THE REPORT CLAIMS GOLDMAN'S
WAREHOUSE CREATES BOTTLENECKS,
LENGTHENING DELIVERY TIMES.
THE BANK PROFIT FROM EXTENDED
RENT AND BETS MADE ON THE FUTURE
OF THOSE METALS BY THEIR TRADING
ARM.
>> John: SO LET'S GET THIS
CLEAR-- IF THESE REPORTS ARE
RIGHT, GOLDMAN CAN BET ON THE
FUTURE PRICE OF ALUMINUM WHILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING THE
ABILITY TO GOOSE THE FUTURE
PRICE OF ALUMINUM IF THAT'S
SOMETHING THEY FIND INTERESTING
AND/OR PROFITABLE.
( LAUGHTER )
IN THE STOCK MARKET, THAT'S
WHAT'S KNOWN AS INSIDER TRADING.
IN THE COMMODITIES MARKET,
THAT'S KNOWN AS SIMPLY THURSDAY.
OR MONDAY OR TUESDAY, FRIDAY, OR
WEDNESDAY.
( LAUGHTER )
SO HOW MUCH IS THIS SCHEME
COSTING THE AMERICAN CITIZEN?
>> THE BEER INSTITUTE ESTIMATING
THE HIGHER PREMIUMS CAUSED BY
THE BOTTLENECKS COST THEM AN
ADDITIONAL $3.6 BILLION EACH
YEAR.
>> John: WAIT, FIRST THINGS
FIRST-- THERE'S A BEER
INSTITUTE?
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> John: THAT'S A PARTY STORE
RIGHT THERE.
I ASSUME THEIR MASCOT IS THE
FIGHTING BLAAH.
SO GOLDMAN SACHS IS MAKING US
PAY BILLIONS MORE FOR ALUMINUM
CANS AND PROFITING OFF THE BACK
OF THAT, THAT MAKES HE SO MAD.
I THINK I NEED A COLD DRINK.
OH, I'M PLAYING INTO THEIR TRAP!
EVERY TIME I USE A CAN, I MAKE
THEM MONEY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT TO CALL MY ACCOUNTANT.
HELLO, BEAR?
OH, NO!
