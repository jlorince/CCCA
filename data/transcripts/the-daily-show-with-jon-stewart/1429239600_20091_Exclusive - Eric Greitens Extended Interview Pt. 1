HE WENT THROUGH THE SEAL TEAMTRAINING WITH ME.
WENT OFF TO AFGHANISTAN.

KIND OF WELCOMED HOME AS THISWAR HERO.

HAMMERED BY HARDSHIP.
HIS BROTHER DIED.
HE LOST HIS BUSINESS, ANDTHEN ONE DAY HE DROVE HIS TRUCK
INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, HE GOT OUT,DROPPED TO THE GROUND BECAUSE HE
THOUGHT THERE WAS A SNIPERWATCHING HIM.
HE GOT UP, HE RAN INTO HISHOUSE, AND HE REALIZED HE HAD
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS THATMY BUDDY STARTED DRINKING.
ZACH DID NOTHING IN MODERATION--
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO ON THE WEEKEND IT WAS NOTA SIX-PACK BUT A COOLER FULL
OF BEER AND THEN HE CALLEDME AFTER HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED.
SO MY BUDDY WHO WAS ONCETHE NAVY SEAL WAR HERO COME HOME

THE PROSPECT OF HAVING HISKIDS COME TO VISIT HIM IN JAIL.
WE TALKED THAT NIGHT AFTER HECALLED ME AND THEN I GOT HOME
AND I STARTED WRITING HIM ALETTER ABOUT RESILIENCE, RIGHT?
ABOUT HOW YOU DEAL WITH HARDSHIPAND BECOME BETTER,
HOW YOU DEAL WITH PAIN ANDBECOME WISER,

AND HE WROTE ME BACK AND FORTHAND THE BOOK IS A SERIES OF
LETTERS TO MY FRIEND WHO I LOVEABOUT HOW YOU CAN BUILD
RESILIENCE IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSEWE ALL HAVE TO DEAL WITH PAIN.
WE ALL HAVE TO DEAL WITHHARDSHIP.

BECAUSE THE LETTERS AREINCREDIBLY ERUDITE.
INCREDIBLY HEARTFELT.
TWO MEN CONSIDERED WARRIORSREALLY OPENING UP.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WAS ZACH COMFORTABLEWITH THAT FROM THE GET-GO?
OR THERE ARE -- I MEAN, THEYSPAN THE LETTERS FROM QUOTING
ARISTOTLE TO LESSONS IN LOGGING.
WHICH IS, QUITE FRANKLY,UNUSUAL.
>> YES. YES, YES. IT'S A LITTLEUNUSUAL.
>> Jon:  BUT HOW COMFORTABLEIS, YOU KNOW-- IS HE IN OPENING
UP TO EVEN A BROTHER, EVEN AFELLOW SEAL, AND KNOWING THAT IT
MIGHT BE OUT THERE PUBLICLY?
>> LOOK, I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH FORANYBODY WHEN YOU COME BACK AND
YOU'RE STRUGGLING.
HE WAS A NAVY SEAL.
HE WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD.
AND HE WAS WAKING UP EVERY DAY,HE HAD MISSIONS TO CONDUCT.
HE HAD A TEAM AROUND HIM.
HE WAS PROUD.
AND NOW HE'S IN THIS PLACE, ANDI REMEMBER WHEN HE CALLED ME,
HE'S ON THE PHONE, AND HE'SJUST-- HE'S HURTING, RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT HE ALSO-- WHAT HAPPENSWAS YOU BUILD A BOND WITH PEOPLE
WHEN YOU SUFFER TOGETHER THE WAYTHAT WE DID, RIGHT?
YOU BUILD A BOND WITH PEOPLEWHEN YOU SERVE TOGETHER, AND YOU
SHARE TOGETHER, AND YOU STUDYTOGETHER.
AND HE KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TOBE THERE FOR HIM.
JUST LIKE I KNOW THAT HE'DALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE WEREABLE TO SHARE WITH EACH OTHER,
AND I THINK THROUGH THAT PROCESSWE BOTH BECAME STRONGER.
>> Jon:  IT WAS INTERESTING,YOU KNOW, AS YOU READ IT, SOME
OF THE DIFFICULY THAT YOUFACE -- NOT JUST, YOU KNOW, WHAT
YOU SEE IN WAR, OR WHAT YOU MAYDO IN WAR-- BUT ALSO THE
FEELING, WHEN YOU'RE A SEAL YOUREALLY ARE AT-- YOU KNOW,
IF THERE IS AN ALL-PROLEVEL OF THE MILITARY,
YOU'RE FUNCTIONINGAS AN ALL-PRO.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU'RE THE TOP LEVEL OFTHE MILITARY.
AND MUCH LIKE, LET'S SAY A PROATHLETE WHO HIS CAREER IS CUT
SHORT, OR THAT, I IMAGINETHERE'S A LOSS OF THAT IDENTITY.
>> YES.
>> Jon: THAT'S REALLY HARD TODEAL WITH.
YOU WERE THE BEST IN THE WORLDAT SOMETHING, AND NOW YOU'RE
JUST ANOTHER GUY, AND IS THATDIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO PROCESS?
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY HARD FORPEOPLE WHEN THEY COME BACK.
IT'S HARD FOR PRO ATHLETES BUTIT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY
RETIRE, RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE WHENTHEIR KIDS LEAVE FOR COLLEGE,
WHEN PEOPLE GO THROUGH THESETRANSITIONS, FOR ENTREPRENEURS
WHEN THEY LOSE A BUSINESS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE WHENTHEY LOSE A LOVED ONE.
YOUR SENSE OF LIFE IN THISMOMENT WHERE THERE'S CHAOS AND
THERE'S CHANGE AND THERE'SDIFFICULTY AND THERE'S HARDSHIP,
ALL OF THESE THINGS COME ANDPEOPLE ASK THE QUESTION,
"WHO AM I GOING TO BE NOW?"
>> Jon: RIGHT.

THEM.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDS. ANDI SAID THERE ARE PEOPLE IN YOUR
COMMUNITY WHO ARE DEALING WITHCANCER
OR THERE ARE PEOPLE IN YOURCOMMUNITY WHO HAVE LOST KIDS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE IN YOURCOMMUNITY WHO ARE REALLY
STRUGGLING AND WHO ARE WORRIEDAND ARE IN THESE PLACES OF
HARDSHIP, AND WHENYOU STEP OUTSIDE OF YOURSELF --
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND YOU GO OUT AND YOU
START SERVING, YOU'RE GOING TOGET STRONGER, ZACH, AND YOU'RE
ALSO GOING TO SEE THAT THERE AREA LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO

LIFE DOESN'T GUARANTEE YOUANYTHING, RIGHT?
AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DEALWITH HARDSHIP, BUT WHAT YOU CAN
DO IS YOU CAN BUILD RESILIENCE.
AND YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOREVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU.
LOTS OF DIFFICULT THINGS CANHAPPEN TO YOU, BUT YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW YOU REACT TOWHAT HAPPENS TO YOU.
