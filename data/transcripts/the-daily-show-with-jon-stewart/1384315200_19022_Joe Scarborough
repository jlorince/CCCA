[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST
TONIGHT COHOST OF MSNBC'SMORNING JOE HIS NEW BOOK IS
CALLED THE RIGHT PATH.
AGAIN, WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM JOE SCARBOROUGH, JOSEPH.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HOW ARE YOU?
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SOLATE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT4:00 IN THE MORNING.
>> IT'S AWFUL.
>> Jon: IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.
>> IT'S HORRIBLE.
TALKING ABOUT THE SHOW OR MEGETTING UP AT 4:00 IN THE
MORNING.
>> Jon: THE SHOW IS LOVELY.
I WATCH THE SHOW.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW.
>> IF YOU DID, WOULD YOU LOVEIT.
>> Jon: EISENHOWER AND REAGAN,IN MY BELIEF WOULD NOT WIN
PRIMARIES IN THE REPUBLICANPARTY ANYMORE, THEY WOULD BE
CONSIDERED COMMUNISTS ESPECIALLYEISENHOWER AFTER HIS MILITARY
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX COMMENT WOULDBE DRUMMED OUT.
TED CRUZ WOULD RUN A CRAZY,GENERAL EISENHOWER MADE OUT WITH
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]THOSE GUYS WOULD -- THEY WOULD
NEVER SURVIVE IN THIS CURRENTMANIFESTATION OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.
>> I ACTUALLY THINK THEY WOULDIF THEY SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE
MORE EXTREME ELEMENTS.
DURING THE 2012 CAMPAIGN, I KEPTSAYING THERE WERE SO MANY SISTER
SOLJA MOMENTS FOR MITT ROMNEY TOSTAND UP AGAINST.
TO STAND DOWN THE CRAZIES ON THEFAR RIGHT OR STAND DOWN THE
CRAZIES IN THE CONSERVATIVEENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX AND HE
NEVER DID IT.
THE THING YOU FIND IN POLITICSIS IF YOU STAND UP TO THE MORE
EXTREME ELEMENTS YOU AREREWARDED NOT ONLY BY YOUR PEOPLE
BUT THIS IS SHOCKING TO SOMEPEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
RIGHT NOW, INDEPENDENTS ANDDEMOCRATS MAY EVEN VOTE FOR YOU.
THAT USED TO BE A GOOD THING IKETHOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING.
REAGAN THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.
WE USED TO WIN 49 OUT OF 50STATES.
>> Jon: BUT YOU USE USED TONOT BE SO CRAZY.
>> WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YOU CAN TALK THE
STRATEGY.
WHEN YOU SAY THEY SHOULD SPEAKOUT AGAINST THEM.
THEY MADE THEM. THIS WAS NOTHAPPENSTANCE, THE RISE
OF TEA PARTY AND ANGRY RIGHT.
KARL ROVE THERE WAS THAT MEMO IN2004, MATTHEW DOWD WROTE ABOUT
IT.
HE DESIGNED THIS TO APPEAL TOWHAT
HE CALLED THE ANGER POINTS.
HE DECIDED THAT THERE WERE NOMORE MODERATES LEFT.
YOU CAN'T REALLY WIN ON THAT I'MGOING TO GET PEOPLE RILED UP.
I'M GOING TO PLAY TO THEIR ANGERAND TO THEIR FEAR.
FOX NEWS DID THE SAME THING.
THEY MADE THESE PEOPLE.
>> LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THOUGH.
KARL ROVE WAS THE FIRST PERSONTO EVER SAY WE'RE GOING TO WIN A
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BY GOINGTO THE HARD RIGHT.
>> Jon: NO, NIXON.
>> NIXON SAID YOU GO TO THERIGHT IN THE PRIMARY AND IN THE
GENERAL ELECTION GO TO THECENTER.
>> Jon: THE SOUTHERN STRATEGYOF NIXON WAS TO TAKE THE
DISAFFECTED OLD DEMOCRATICVOTERS THAT WERE
BIGOTED, THE OLD DIXIE-CRATS,PLAY ON THAT ANGER
DIVIDETHEM AND GET THEM TO THE PO
>> NIXON GOT A HIGHER PERCENTAGEOF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS THAN
ANY REPUBLICAN HAS GOTTEN INYEARS.
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD PUTTHE SOUTHERN STRATEGY ON NIXON.
I DO SAY A STRONG LEADER THATSPEAKS OUT AGAINST THE EXTREMES
WHETHER IT'S BILL CLINTON ORWHETHER IT'S THE REPUBLICANS.
WE CAN SAY CHRIS CHRISTIE IN NEWJERSEY FRANKLY DOESN'T GIVE A
DAMN WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT HIMON BLOGS.
OCCASIONALLY HE WILL YELL ATPEOPLE.
>> Jon: TEACHERS WHO COME UPTO HIM AND ASK QUESTIONS.
HEY, MAN, HOW ABOUT THE TEACHERSUNION, GET OUT OF HER -- HERE
YOU SON OF A BITCH --THE BIGGER POINT IS IF YOU ARE A
STRONG LEADER AND YOU CAN CALLOUT CRAZY YOU'LL GET REWARDED.
NOT ONLY BY INDEPENDENTS ANDDEMOCRATS BUT YOUR OWN PARTY.
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN A LONGTIME.
DWIGHT EISENHOWER, HE HAD THECONFIDENCE AND THE POWER TO PULL
IT OFF.
RONALD REAGAN WAS A GUY.
>> Jon: IT WAS A DIFFERENTMENTALITY.
NIXON, EISENHOWER, NOT REAGAN TOTHE SAME EXTENT, BUT THOSE WERE
PEOPLE THAT BELIEVED IN THEPOWER OF GOVERNMENT TO DO GREAT
THINGS FOR PEOPLE.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENTMANIFESTATION.
IT'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE -- IT'SLIKE -- I LIKEN IT TO THIS.
IF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, THECOUNCIL OF CARDINALS, LET'S SAY
35% OF THAT WERE ATHEISTS.
RIGHT.
>> THEY WERE LIKE LET US RUN THECATHOLIC CHURCH WE KNOW WHAT TO
DO.
>> MIGHT BE A BAD IDEA.
>> IT'S THE TYPE OF NIHILISM YOUGET.
>> HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.
A NEW DEMOCRAT ELECTED IN 1992.
WE ALL CALLED SATAN. WE GOTELECTED FOR DOING THAT IN 1994,
AMERICANS SAID YOU WENT TOO FARLEFT.
WE COME ALONG WE'RE SUPPOSED TOPULL HIM TO THE CENTER WE GO
TOO FAR RIGHT WE REELECT BILLCLINTON. YOU TALK ABOUT KARLL
ROVE IN 2004, WE SAW HOW WELL KARL ROVE DID IN
2012.
I DON'T THINK HE COULD PLAN THATFAR AHEAD TO CREATE THE TEA
PARTY IN 2010.
THAT WAS A CREATION OF WHATHAPPENED IN 2009 AND 2010.
NOT JUST WITH BARACK OBAMA BUTWITH GEORGE W. BUSH A BIG
SPENDING REPUBLICAN WHO SPENT USINTO DEBT.
HE GAVE US MEDICARE PART d.
>> Jon: BUT THEY DON'T EVERTALK ABOUT IT IN THAT MATTER.
THEY NEVER SAY THEDEFICIT IS FROM BUSH.
>> THAT PISSES ME OFF.
I WAS HERE IN 2004 HIS A BOOKBEFORE THE ELECTION IN 2004 I
SAID BUSH IS BANKRUPTING US.
HIS FOREIGN POLICY IS GOING TOBANKRUPT US.
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE NEXTELECTION AND GOING TO WRECK THE
ELECONOMY. I WAS CALLED A RINOETHEN FOR WARNING ABOUT BIG
GOVERNMENT REPUBLICANISM.
NOW I'M BEING ATTACKED FORWRITING THINGS LIKE THIS SAYING
WE SERIOUSLY WE PROBABLYSHOULDN'T DRIVE THE BEER TRUCK
OFF THE CLIFF.
I'M SAYING THE SAME EXACT THING.
I'M AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENTREPUBLICANISM.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING THEPAST TEN YEARS HAVE ALL BEEN
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU?
>> EXACTLY.
EXACTLY.
AT LEAST THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
NOW YOU KNOW!
NOT YOU.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE EVERINFLUENCED YOU BUT IT'S COMING
TOGETHER, ISN'T IT?
>> Jon: NO!
THE RIGHT PATH IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
MR. JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH
