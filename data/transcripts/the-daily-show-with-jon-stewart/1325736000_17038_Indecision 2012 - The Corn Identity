>> Jon: HI, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
WHAT A WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF
ENTHUSIASM.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR
ELIZABETH DOWLING TAYLOR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NICE.
WOW.
SUCH HARD NAME TO PRONOUNCE.
OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT WE'LL BE
DEALING WITH IOWA AND OUR
UP-TO-THE-MINUTE COVERAGE OF ALL
THE [BLEEPED] YOU ALREADY KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK, I REASON THE FIRST ONE TO
EXPRESS HOW ON SERDLY
OVERCOVERED THE IOWA CAUCUSES
ARE.
IT'S ONE POLL WIDELY
UNREPRESENTATIVE OF AMERICANS.
THAT BEING SAID, WATCHING IOWANS
STUFF HAND-WRITTEN BALLOTS INTO
REPURPOSEED GIFT BOXES AS TO
NEUTRALIZE ANY EAST COAST BIG
CITY ELITIST SMEAR, I WOULD LIKE
THE DRIZZLE ALL OVER IT LIKE
RASPBERRY BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE.
I WANT TO [BLEEPED] ON THIS, BUT
IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL.
THE ENTIRE IOWA PROCESS SEEMS
LIKE AN HISTORICAL RE-ENACTMENT
ABYET SHOCKS YOU CAN ITS
SIMPLICITY.
YOU'RE FLOODED WITH A BYGONE
ERA.
IT'S LIKE WALKING INTO A HOUSE
AND THEY'VE GOT A FIRE GOING IN
THIS WEIRD PIT AND THEY'RE LIKE,
WHAT'S THAT.
AND THEY'RE LIKE, IT'S BOOED,
BUT IT'S BURNING.
THE FIREPLACE.
BUT WHERE ARE THE GAS JETS OR
THE REMOTE.
I REALLY THINK THE IOWA CAUCUSES
ARE ONE OF THE FEW EVENTS IN OUR
CIVIC LIFE WHERE IT WOULD BE
INDESTRUCTIVE TO ALLOW IT TO
PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS
BECAUSE IT GIVES US A DEEPER
UNDERSTANDING TO OUR CONNECTION
TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
HOW DO YOU THINK CNN WILL
[BLEEPED] THAT UP.
>> CHECK OUT THESE LITTLE GUYS.
IMAGINE THEY'RE IOWA REPUBLICANS
SHOWING UP FOR CAUCUSES.
THAT'S A REPRESENTATIVE OF MITT
ROMNEY.
HE'S GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE
ROOM TO PROMOTE HIS CANDIDATE.
THE CAUCUSGOERS GET A CHANCE TO
VOTE.
THEY CAN WRITE IT DOWN OP A
PIECE OF PAPER.
>> THEY HAVE A TELEPHONE.
THEY CAN CALL AND GIVE THE
RESULTS OF THAT CAUCUS.
>> Jon: WHY!
WHY?
WHY!
THERE ARE ROOMS IN 9 9 COUNTIES
IN IOWA DEMONSTRATING THE REAL
THING AND YOU HAVE CAMERAS, WHY
THIS MULTICOLORED FEATURELESS
DILDO PEOPLE?
[LAUGHTER]
FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS IS WHY
PEOPLE... REALLY NOT THAT FOND
OF CNN AT TIMES.
AFTER SIX HOURS MOSTLY
UNNECESSARY COVERAGE, ACTUAL
CAUCUSES RESULTS TRICKLED IN.
THE TWO BIGGEST WINNERS, MICHELE
BACHMANN AND RICK PERRY, WHO
CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF MY
FAVORITE CANDIDATES FOR HIS COME
PROOTLY UNJUSTIFIED ENTHUSIASM
IN THE FACE OF A FIFTH-PLACE ASS
KICKING.
>> YEAH.
YOU BET.
YOU KIDS ARE AWESOME.
>> WE LOVE YOU, RICK.
>> ALL RIGHT.
HEY, BROTHER.
OH, MAN, THANK YOU, MAN.
YOU AN RUTH WERE AWESOME.
JON JON WHOOO.
WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY.
I SPENT A [BLEEPED] LOAD OF
MONEY IN IOWA, DIDN'T GET A
WHOLE LOT OF VOTES.
WHAT'S UP?
I HAD A HELL OF A TIME.
I THINK MY CAMPAIGN MIGHT BE
DEAD IN THE WATER, BY OUR HOTEL
IN DES MOINES WAS COOL AS
[BLEEPED].
THE FOOD WAS GREAT AND THE MAID
FOLDED THE ENDS OF THE TOILET
PAPER LIKE A FAN SHAPE.
I FELT GUILTY WIPING MY HIND
QUARTERS WITH IT TO BE HONEST.
THIS PLACE PUTS THE RAD IN
"RADISSON."
BY THE WAY, I GOT CRUSHED.
FOR MICHELE BACHMANN, HER SIXTH
PLACE FINISH WAS REFLECTED IN
HER SOMBER CONFESSION, BUT AS
ALWAYS, THERE WAS ONE SILVER
LINING.
>> I MUST THANK MY WONDERFUL
HUSBAND OF 33 YEARS MARCUS
BACHMANN.
AND YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE OUT
ON MAIN STREET IN DES MOINES, HE
WAS BUYING DOGGIE SUNGLASSES FOR
OUR DOG BOOMER WHILE WE WERE OUT
VISITING ALL OF THE MANY
BUSINESSES.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: SERIOUSLY.
LOOK AT THE FACE HE'S MAKING.
THE ONLY SOUND YOU CAN MAKE WHEN
YOUR MOUTH IS SHAPED THAT WAY IS
"HO OH," WHICH TRANSLATES TO
"SORRY I RUINED YOUR CAMPAIGN
BECAUSE OF MY OBSESSION WITH DOG
ACCESSORIES.
ALTHOUGH NOTHING SAYS SIXTH-LACE
FINISH LIKE DOG ACCESSO
