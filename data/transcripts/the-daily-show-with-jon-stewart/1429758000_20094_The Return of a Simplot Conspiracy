>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOWWHAT,
IF YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIMELOOKING AT FOOD PACKAGING AND
I DO, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHENYOU'RE HIGH YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE EATING.
( LAUGHTER )YOU MIGHT THINK THE THREE MOST
TERRIFYING LETTERS IN THEENGLISH LANGUAGE ARE G-M-O.
BUT W-H-Y?
ASSIF MANDVI INVESTIGATES.
>> POTATOES.
THESE STARCHY DELIGHTS HAVEBEEN THE STAPLE OF OUR FOOD
SINCE THE DAWN OF MAN, BUT NOWSCIENCE IS TRYING TO CHANGE ALL
THAT.
>> THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OFAGRICULTURE HAS GIVEN THE GREEN
LIGHT TO A GENETICALLY MODIFIEDPOTATO.
>> NO, POTATO!
WHY?
AND THIS DEADLY G.M.O. TUBER,DEVELOPED BY EVIL AGRICULTURE
CORPORATIONS HAS MEN LIKEJEFFREY SMITH TERRIFIED.
>> WE BELIEVE THAT GENETICALLYENGINEERED CROPS MAY BE ONE OF
THE MOST DANGEROUS INTRODUCTIONSOF AN ADDITIVE IN SUPPLY IN OUR
HISTORY.
>> SMITH, FOUNDER OF THEINSTITUTE FOR RESPONSIBLE
TECHNOLOGY AND ONE OF THELEADING ANTI-G.M.O. VOICES IN
THE WORLD, EXPLAINS EXACTLY HOWG.M.O. POTATOES WILL KILL US.
>> THE PROCESS ITSELF ISDANGEROUS.
THEY CREATE A LITTLE PIECE OFR.N.A., AND PUT IT INTO THE
POTATO SO THAT IT SILENCES SOMEGENES.
IF WE EAT THE POTATO, IT MIGHTREGULATE OUR OWN GENE
EXPRESSION, CAUTION SERIOUSPROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DEATH.
>> JESUS.
>> THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF ITGENERICALLY UNSAFE.
>> ( BLEEP ) MONSANTO, RIGHT?
>> WELL, NOT IN THE CASE OF THISPOTATO.
THIS IS SIMPLOT, J.R. SIMPLOT,THE BIG POTATO PRODUCER.
>> DID YOU SAY SIMPOT?>> I DID.
>> NO ( BLEEP ). SIMPLOT? YOUMAY NOT REMEMBER THEM,
BUT I DO.
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT TO IDAHOAND UNCOVERED A CONSPIRACY THAT
INVOLVED SIMPLOT, POLUTION, ANE.P.A. COVER-UP, A TWO-HEADED
FISH AND I WAS ALMOSTARRESTED TWICE.
IT COULD HAVE RUINED MY CAREER.
SIMPLOT!
I'M NOT DOING IT.
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT DOING SIMPOT.
OKAY.
I'VE DONE IT.
I'VE DONE THAT.
BEEN THERE. ( BLEEP ).
NO! NO! NO YOU GET THE ( BLEEP )
>> THIS IS YOUR ( BLEEP ) SHOW.>> THIS IS YOU ( BLEEP ) FAULT.
OKAY YOU ( BLEEP ). YOU DIDN'TTELL ME IT WAS ( BLEEP )
SIMPLOT.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.
BENNETT!
FINE!
FINE!
( BLEEP ) SIMPLOT.
BUT STRANGELY, ACCORDING TOCORNELL'S POTATO MOLECULAR
GENETICIST WALTER DE JONG,SIMPLOT'S DEVIL TATER
IS ACTUALLY AN ANGEL TOT.
>> THE POTATO PRODUCES LESSACRYLAMIDE WHEN FRIED.
>> RIGHT.
>> ACRYLAMIDE IS A NEUROTOXIN,A POSSIBLE CARCINOGEN.
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THE SIMPOTPOTATO CUTS DOWN ON POSSIBLE
CARCINOGENS.
>> YES.
>> BUT WHAT ABOUT LIKE WHEN THER.N.A. GETS INTO MY BODY AND
CHANGES MY D.N.A.?
IT'S MOVING ( BLEEP ) AROUND.
>> GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPSDON'T ALTER HUMAN D.N.A.
>> WHAT IF THEY DID?
>> THEY DON'T.
OUR BODIES HAVE BEEN SLICING ANDDICING D.N.A. FOR AS LONG AS
WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE.
>> SO THERE'S NO CHANGE TO THED.N.A.?
>> THERE'S NO CHANGE TO OURD.N.A.
>> SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY WHO ISWORKING FOR SIMPOT.
>> I DON'T WORK FOR SIMPLOT.
>> THEY PAY FOR YOURRESEARCH.
>> NO, THEY DON'T FUND MYRESEARCH IN ANY WAY.
>> THEN YOU GO TO THEIR PARTIESAND YOU HANG OUT WITH THEM.
>> NO, I DO NOT.
>> OKAY, OKAY, JUST BECAUSE HE'SNOT ON THE POTATO'S PAYROLL,
DOESN'T MEAN OTHER FRANKENVEGGIES WON'T KILL US.
THERE'S ALSO CORN THATPRODUCES ITS OWN TOXIC
INSECTICIDE THAT BREAK OPENLITTLE HOLES IN HUMAN CELLS AS
WELL.
>> THE BT PROTEIN THATYOU'RE REFERING TO DOES NOT
CREATE HOLES IN OUR CELLS.
>> NO, LIKE IT LIKE BURNSTHROUGH THE CELL AND CREATES
A HOLE IN YOUR CELL.
>> WHAT WOULD MAKE A HOLE INYOUR CELL?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
NO, NO I HEARD THAT SOMEWHERE.
>> IT'S-- YEAH.
>> SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THATTHESE POTATOES ARE NOT
DANGEROUS.
>> THE POTATO IS JUST AS SAFE ASCOCONVENTIONALLY DEVELOPED
POTATOES.
>> PO-TAT-O.>> POTATO.
>> REALLY, IT'S NOT DANGEROUS?THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS.
THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS.
>> PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.
>> THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS. THAT'SNOT DANGEROUS?
PRETTY DANGEROUS TO ME.
TURNS OUT THAT WALTER'S NOTALONE.
A RECENT PEW POLL SHOWS THAT 88%OF SCIENTISTS BELIEVE G.M.O.s
ARE SAFE, WHILE ONLY 37% OFAMERICANS BELIEVE THEM.
BUT LUCKY FOR US--
>> I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
I WORK-- I INTERVIEW SCIENTISTSAND TRANSLATE SCIENCE INTO
ENGLISH SO THAT EVERYONE CANUNDERSTAND.
SO, YEAH, I'VE INTERVIEWED A LOTOF SCIENTISTS, TOO.
>> SOMETIMES I PURPOSELY PLAYDUMB SO THAT THEY EXPLAIN IT IN
A WAY THAT MAKES ITREALLY CLEAR, AND--
>> I DO THE SAME THING.>> AND I -- YEAH.
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> DAVID SUZUKI, A GENETICISTAND TV PERSONALITY SAID IF ANY
SCIENTIST TELLS THAT YOUG.M.O.s ARE SAFE, THEY'RE
EITHER VERY STUPID OR LYING.
>> I SEE, SO SCIENTISTS ARE ALLSTUPID LIARS, WHICH I SUPPOSE IS
WHY NONE OF THE ACTUAL SIMPLOTPOTATO SCIENTISTS WOULD TALK TO
US.
>> NO, THEY'RE WORRIED THATTHEIR LABS AND FIELDS WILL BE
TARGETED.
>> TARGETED BY WHO?
>> G.M.O. FOES.
>> SO THE ANTI-G.M.O. PEOPLE ARETHE ASSHOLES
AND SIMPLOT ARE THE GOOD GUYS.
>> UNCHARACTERISTIC, BUT YES.
>> OKAY, OKAY, BUT THESEAGRA-BUSINESSES HAVE A MONOPOLY
ON OUR ENTIRE FOOD SUPPLY ANDTHAT IS A HORRIFYING FACT
THAT EVEN SCIENTISTSCANNOT ARGUE, RIGHT?
>> ACTUALLY, THE GREATESTDAMAGE DONE BY THE ANTI-G.M.O.
LOBBY IS THE THEINCREASED REGULATORY COSTS
THAT ANYONE NOW DEVELOPING AGENETICALLY MODIFIED CROP
HAS TO GO THROUGH MEANS THATONLY THE BIG COMPANIES WITH
THE DEEPEST POCKETS CAN PLAY ANDIT'S LEADING TO A HAND FULL OF
COMPANIES CONTROLLING SEEDS OFALL OF OUR MAJOR CROPS.
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THEANTI-GMO LOBBY IS ACTUALLY
RESULTING IN A MONOPOLY BYCOMPANIES LIKE SIMPLOT AND
MONSTANTO.
>> IT'S AN UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCE, YES.
>> THAT'S LIKE ( BLEEP ).
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.
IN THIS STORY IT'S NOTSCIENTISTS OR AGRO-BUSINESS
MESSING WITH OUR FOOD SUPPLY.
IT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVINCEDTHE WORLD THAT THE SIMPLOT
POTATO WILL TURN THIS INTO THIS.
>> IT'S MR. G.M.O POTATOHEAD.
>> I LOVE YOU G.M.O. POTATOHEAD.
>> I'M GOING TO EAT SOME NOW.
