[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN, GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST LEGENDARY BRAZILLANFOOTBALLER PELE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I'LL ASK HIM HOW HE FEELS ABOUT
ACHIEVING HIS LIFE'SGOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAALS!
[LAUGHTER]BUT FIRST BIG CAMPAIGN FINANCE
DECISION OUT OF THE NATION'SHIGHEST COURT.
>> BREAKING NEWS FROM THESUPREME COURT.
MAJOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONCASE.
>> THE CASE WAS BROUGHT BYALABAMA BUSINESSMAN SHAUN
MCCUTCHEON WHO ARGUES HESHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT
AS MANY CANDIDATES AS HEWANTS IN AN ELECTION CYCLE.
>> Jon: WHO IS STOPPING YOU?
I MEAN IT'S YOUR LAWN, RIGHT?
I MEAN --[LAUGHTER]
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU DON'T MEANSUPPORT LIKE SUPPORT, YOU MEAN
SUPPORT LIKE SUPPORT.
>> I THINK THIS IS A FUNDAMENTALFREE SPEECH ISSUE ABOUT YOUR
RIGHT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ASMANY CANDIDATES AS YOU CHOOSE.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
I'M SORRY IT'S THE WHOLE MONEYEQUALS SPEECH AS A WAY TO
FURTHER AMPLIFY BIG DONOR'SINFLUENCE ON POLITICS.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE FOR SOMEREASON MONEY EQUALING MONEY
WASN'T GETTING IT DONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> THE COURT LEFT IN TACT HOW
MUCH ANY PERSON CAN GIVE TO ASINGLE FEDERAL CANDIDATE BUT IT
DID AWAY WITH A LIMIT ON HOWMUCH ANYBODY CAN GIVE TO ALL
CANDIDATES PUT TOGETHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: VICTORY.
FINALLY WE'RE RID OF THECOROSIVE
INFLUENCE OF NOT ENOUGH MONEY INPOLITICS.
>> BASICALLY IT GIVES PEOPLE WHOHAVE A LOT OF MONEY AT THEIR
DISPOSAL THE CHANCETO SPREAD THEIR INFLUENCE EVEN
MORE WIDELY. IF YOU HAVE $1MILLION THINK OF HOW MANY
CHUNKS OF $5200 THAT MAKES.
>> YOU CAN WRITE A LOT OFCHECKS.
>> Jon: YEP. LOTS AND LOTS OF
$5200 CHECKS.
THE LAST GREAT HOPE OFPRESERVING OUR DEMOCRACY FROM
THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OFMONEY IS CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME.
[LAUGHTER]ALL RIGHT, WHAT RATIONALE --
[ APPLAUSE ]-- WHAT RATIONALE DID THE COURT
USE TO JUSTIFY THIS 5 TO 4 SPLITDECISION.
LET'S HEAR SOME DISSENT FROMLIBERAL JUSTICE KAGAN.
>> IF YOU TAKE OFF THEAGGREGATE LIMITS PEOPLE WILL
BE ALLOWED, YOU PUT TOGETHER THENATIONAL COMMITTEES
AND STATE COMMITTEES AND ALL THECANDIDATES IN THE HOUSE
AND THE SENATE IT COMES TOOVER $3.5 MILLION.
>> Jon: I AM SORRY.
THE VISUAL -- THE SUPREME COURTDOESN'T ALLOW CAMERAS INTO THE
SUPREME COURT.
I ASSUME TO PROTECT THE JUDGE'SPRIVACY FROM THOSE REVENGE
UP-ROBE PORN SITES.
[LAUGHTER]BUT WHAT YOU SAW THERE WE HAD
OUR DAILY SHOW COURT SKETCHARTIST AT THE COURT TO CAPTURE
THE ARGUMENTS.
THAT'S WHERE THOSE DRAWINGS COMEFROM.
HERE IS THE CONSERVATIVEREBUTTAL.
FIRST SCALIA SPEAKS FROM THEBENCH IN HIS HOT TUB FULL OF
MONEY.
GO.
>> JUST TO PUT THAT INPERSPECTIVE, HOW MUCH MONEY IS
SPENT BY POLITICAL PARTIES ANDPACS IN ALL ELECTIONS THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY?
WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT UP I DON'TTHINK $3.5 MILLION IS A HECK OF
A LOT OF MONEY.
>> Jon: ANTONIN SCALIA'SARGUMENT THE STRICT
CONSTRUCTIONIST JUSTICE, HISARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE SURE
$3.5 MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A DONORIS MAKING IT RAIN UNTIL YOU
COMPARE THAT TO THE MONSOONSEASON OF MONEY THAT WE
UNLEASHED IN OUR PREVIOUSCITIZENS UNITED DECISION
ALLOWING CORPORATIONSAND UNIONS TO DONATE TO
SUPER PACS. I BELIEVETHE FIGURE THERE THE
LIMIT WAS WHATEVER THE (bleep)YOU WANT.
[ LAUGHTER ]YOU MAY THINK EVEN THOUGH THERE
ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INPOLITICS, SURELY MILLIONS CAN
STILL HAVE SOME CORRUPTINGEFFECT, NO?
AND AREN'T WE, BY ATTEMPTING TOLIMIT CONTRIBUTIONS, JUST TRYING
TO LIMIT THE CORRUPTINGINFLUENCE OF MONEY OR AT LEAST
THE APPEARANCE OF THE CORRUPTINGINFLUENCE OF MONEY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THATBECAUSE IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE
(bleep) WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THISSUPREME COURT, THE ONLY KIND
OF CORRUPTION THAT MATTERSIS THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE
THOMAS NAST-LIKE MONOCLE TOPHATTED MAN HANDS A BAG OF MONEY
LABELED MONEY FOR BRIBE
TO A LITERAL FAT CAT WHILE THEAMERICAN PUBLIC STANDS BEHIND
THEM WEARING A BARREL KNOWN ASQUID PRO QUO CORRUPTION.
>> UNLESS THE MONEY ISTRANSFERRED.
YOU HAVE TO GET IT FROM THEPERSON WHO WANTS TO CORRUPT TO
THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BECORRUPTED.
UNLESS THE MONEY CAN MAKE ITFROM A TO B I DON'T SEE WHERE
THE QUID PRO QUO ARGUMENT IS.
>> Jon: IS HE (bleep) THAT BAG?
NO WONDER THEY DON'T WANTCAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM.
