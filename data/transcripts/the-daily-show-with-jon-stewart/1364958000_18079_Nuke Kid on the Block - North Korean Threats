WITH THE GOOSE STEPPING AND THE HILL CONQUERING AND -- REALLY CARDBOARD CUT OUT TARGETS AND
THERE'S A COMMANDER ON THE BRIDGE?
WHAT IS THAT, BINOCULARS?
MAGNIFIED VISION IN BOTH EYES?
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT WE'VE MOVED ON FROM THAT PAST THING.
WAR IS A LITTLE MORE MODERN NOW.
>> TWO MASSIVE B-2'S SOARED 6500 MILES FROM MISSOURI TO DROP DUMMY WEAPONS ON A BOMBING RANGE
WEST OF SOUTH KOREA AND LESS THAN 50 MILES FROM THE NORTH KOREAN BORDER AND THEN FLEW BACK
TO THE U.S.
>> Jon: FOR LUNCH MOTHER (bleep).
FOR LUNCH!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE MIDDAY MEAL [ONE PERSON IN CROWD CHANTS U.S.A.]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
YOU UNDERSTAND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LOOK, WE'RE FLATTERED, BUT WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.
WE'LL CALL YOU.
>> THIS WARNING THE NORTH VOWED TO RESTART A NUCLEAR REACTOR.
