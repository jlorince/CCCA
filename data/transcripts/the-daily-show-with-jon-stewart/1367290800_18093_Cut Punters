>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE
IS JON STEWART.MY NAME
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
FROM "MAD MEN" JON HAMM WILL BE
JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM.
HE'S KOSHER FOR PAPS OVER, THAT
MAN.
LET ME SAY THIS-- LET'S BEGIN
TONIGHT WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS.
WE ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK UP
"CONGRESS" IN THE DICTIONARY, IT
SAYS, "DO NOT ( BLEEP ) TARREDS
WHO COULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
IF IT WAS EATING THEM ALIVE ANUS
FIRST  ♪ ♪
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
HOLD ON.
I SHOULD MENTION I ONLY USE
URBAN DICTIONARIES.
BUT IT IS WHY THE DETRIMENTAL
EFFECTS OF THE SEQUESTER, THE
PAINFUL ACROSS-THE-BOARD BUDGET
CUTS THAT ARE WREAKING HAVOC ON
FEDERAL SERVICES, SEEM LIKE
THEY'RE HERE TO STAY.
EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
ARE RUNNING OUT IN WESTERN
MASSACHUSETTS.
HEAD START PROGRAMS ARE CLOSING
EARLY IN RHODE ISLAND.
JOBLESS CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE
FORGOING $1.2 BILLION EACH WEEK.
SENIORS IN MAINE ARE GOING
WITHOUT MEALS ON WHEELS, WHICH,
BY THE WAY, SEEMS LIKE A COOL
PROGRAM TO BEGIN WITH.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
HE'S HUNGRY!
HE'S SO-- THERE GOES MY-- MY
PIE.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S YET NEWS FROM CONGRESS
LAST WEEK WAS SO SURPRISING AND
SO WELCOME.
>> DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
CAME TOGETHER LATE LAST NIGHT.
>> IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE IMPACT
OF THE SEQUESTER.
>> Jon:  PRAISE IT BE OUR
ESTEEMED LEADER!
WHAT BOLD LEGISLATIVE ACTION
HAVE THEY UNDERTAKEN TO EASE
AMERICA'S BURDEN?
>> BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS MOVED
QUICKLY TO GIVE THE FEDERAL
AVIATION ADMINISTRATION MORE
FLEXIBILITY IN CUTTING THEIR
BUDGET, ALLOWING THEM TO BRING
BACK AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
STAFFING TO 100%.
>> Jon:  OH, THAT'S VERY
INTERESTING.
( LAUGHTER )
CERTAINLY, VERY HELPFUL.
WHY, PER CHANCE, THAT PART OF
THE SEQUESTER?
>> A FEW HOURS AFTER VOTING,
MEMBERS LEFT CAPITOL HILL AND
HEADED TO THE AIRPORT FOR A
WEEK-LONG RECESS.
>> Jon:  OH, RIGHT!
( APPLAUSE )
OH, RIGHT!
BECAUSE--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S THE PROBLEM FROM THE
SEQUESTER THAT AFFECTS THEM.
( LAUGHTER )
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MEALS ON
WHEELS UNLESS IT'S ROLLING DOWN
AN AISLE.
HERE'S THE BEST PART-- HOW FAST
THEY CAN GET SOMETHING DONE ARE
WHEN IT AFFECTS THEM.
>> THEY PASSED THE BILL THAT WAS
CRAFTED SO QUICKLY, PARTS OF IT
WERE HANDWRITTEN.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  LEAKS, I TAKE YOU
TO LEGISLATION THEATER.
( LAUGHTER )
OPEN ON THE HOUSE FLOOR.
WHAT TIME DOES YOUR PLANE TAKE
OFF?
"8:00."
I TONIGHT KNOW WHY THEY HAVE THE
SAME VOICE.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
HOLD ON.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
DOESN'T MATTER.
"8:00?
YOU BETTER LEAVE NOW.
THE LINES ARE VERY LONG."
"WHY?"
"YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE
INDISCRIMINATELY CUT FEDERAL
FUNDING ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE
WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD FORCE US
TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO OUR
BUDGET IMPASSE."
"OH, YEAH, YEAH."
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY LONG LINES
AT THE AIRPORT?"
"YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG
TIME."
"( BLEEP ), GIVE ME A PEN."
DONE!
"NOW LET'S GO HOME."
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT.
( APPLAUSE )
THE PLAY SOMEWHAT FELL APART IN
THE SECOND ACT.
( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, I'M NOT SURE WHY
HANDWRITING THE BILL GETS IT
DONE FASTER.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, IF YOU GIVE
CONGRESS COMPUTERS DO THEY JUST
SPEND ALL THEIR TIME ON PORN
SITES PROCRASTURBATING, USING
MASTURBATION TO OCTER WISE
OCCUPY YOURSELF.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE FILLED WITH
PROCRASTURBATERS.
I GUESS WE'RE LUCKY THEY'RE
HERE.
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, HOPEFULLY CONGRESS IS AT
LEAST SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED BY
THIS EXERCISE IN SELF-INTEREST.
>> I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE SENATE
HAS JUST PASSED A BIPARTISAN
BILL TO RESOLVE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM CONFRONTING THE AMERICAN
TRAVELING PUBLIC AND OUR
ECONOMY, AND IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER WE
REALLY CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS.
>> Jon:  YEAH, HOW NICE FOR
YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
I THINK I HAVE A NEW WORD FOR
THE URBAN DICTIONARY-- CONGRATS
BAITING.
CREATING A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, AND PRAISING
ONES FOR FIXING THE SMALL PART
OF THE PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS YOU,
AND THEN
