[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
WE'VE GOT KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL JOINING US, OBVIOUSLY NAME FOR HIS FATHER'S FAVORITE PHILOSOPHER, RAND McNALLLY.
A SHORT TIME AGO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND GOVERNOR ROMNEY WRAPPED UP THEIR FIRST DEBATE.
WHO KNOWS IF THEY EVEN HAD THE DEBATE WITH YESTERDAY'S BOMBSHELL.
FULL DAY, DRUDGE-CON ONE, BLUE SIREN ALERT, OBAMA RACE VIDEO.
HANNITY HAD THE EXCLUSIVE.
>> TONIGHT YOU WILL HEAR FROM BARACK OBAMA LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD FROM HIM BEFORE.
A VIDEO HAS BEEN UNCOVERED FROM A CAMPAIGN EVENT IN 2007 OF THEN-CANDIDATE OBAMA.
IT CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST DIVISIVE CLASS WARFARE AND RARLLY CHARGED RHETORIC EVER USE BY BARACK OBAMA.
>> Jon: CASUALLY TOSSING OUT WORDS LIKE HONKY, WHITE TRASH, O-FAY, SPF-45 WEARING MOTHER...
THE VIDEO HAD BEEN WIDELY COVERED WHEN THE EVENT OCCURRED IN 2007, BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'LL LET HANNITY'S GUEST EXPLAIN.
>> PEOPLE SAY, THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED.
WELL, IT HASN'T BEEN, AND I KNOW BECAUSE I REPORTED ON IT THE FIRST TIME.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: SO LET'S SEE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS, EXPLOSIVE VIDEO.
>> CRACKER ASS, CRACKER ASS CRACKER.
I WISH THAT CRACKER WOULD HAVE SAID SOME [BLEEPED] TO ME.
SALTINE ASS MOTHER [BLEEPED].
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST CHRIS ROCK, ONE OF HIS FINE COMEDY SKITS ON RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA.
I SHOW THAT IN LOU OF THE OBAMA TAPES BECAUSE THE OBAMA TAPES ARE FAR MORE EXPLOSIVE.
IN IT, OBAMA EXPLAINS HOW HURRICANE KATRINA HAS A RARELY COMPONENT AND SAYS...
>> WE DON'T NEED TO BUILD MORE HIGHWAYS OUT IN THE SUBURBS IF WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE CITIES RIGHT NOW WHO HAVE TO WORK BUT
HAVE NO WAY TO GET TO THE JOBS.
WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN OUR MINORITY OWNED NEIGHBORHOODS SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL.
>> Jon: IT'S A BLACK VIEW FIRST SPOKE IN 2005.
>> THERE'S DEEP, PERSISTENT POVERTY IN THIS REGION, AS WELL.
THAT POVERTY HAS ROOTS IN THE HISTORY OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN THE STREETS WERE REBUILT.
THERE SHOULD BE MANY NEW BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES, ALONG THOSE STREETS.
>> Jon: [AS GEORGE W. BUSH]: YOU SEE, WHAT I'M TRYING SAY IS THIS: WE DIDN'T LAND ON PLYMOUTH
ROCK, PLYMOUTH ROCK, YOU SEE, WON'T GET LANDED ON AGAIN.
HE HE HE.
SO DESPITE THE FACT WHAT BARACK OBAMA WAS SAYING ECHOED THE SENTIMENTSES OF OTHER MAINSTREAM POLITICIANS AND DESPITE THE FACT
THAT IT ECHOED HIS OWN SPEECH IN 2007 THAT AIRED LIVE ON CNN, OBAMA'S REAL CRIME WAS NOT THE CONTENT AND THE MESSAGE, BUT THE
RHYTHM, OH, THE RHYTHM.
THE RHYTHM IS GOING TO GET YOU.
>> YOU NOTICE THE WAY IN THE WAY HE DELIVERS THE SPEECH BEFORE A PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN?
>> THE ACCENT, HE'S SPEAKING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE, DIFFERENT CADENCE, DIFFERENT ACCENT, DIFFERENT GESTURES.
THE FALSENESS IS OVERWHELMING.
>> WE HAVE THE ACCENT.
WE HAVE ANGER.
THEY DON'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT YOU.
>> Jon: WE HAVE JIVE TALK.
WE HAVE NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.
WE'VE GOT BY ANY MEANS NESTLE WE'VE GOT SAY IT LOUD, I'M BLACK AND PROUD.
ALL THIS AND MORE ON K-TEL'S "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL RACE-BAITING." IF YOU BELIEVE A CANDIDATE SPEAKING BLACK BEFORE BLACK
VOTERS DISQUALIFIES THEM FROM BEING PRESIDENT, I HAVE UNEARTHED A VIDEO THAT JUST MIGHT TURN THIS ENTIRE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE UPSIDE DOWN.
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT, WHO, WHO?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?
DID YOU KNOW MITT ROMNEY WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL BAJA MEN?
NOT THE BAND.
HE JUST KEEPS HIS MONEY IN BAJA.
HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THIS, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, SEAN HANNITY, YOU BELIEVE THE THIS PRESIDENT TO BE WHAT?
>> HE'S THE WORST PRESIDENT WE'VE HAD IN MY LIFETIME.
A WORSE PRESIDENT THAN JIMMY CARTER.
THIS IS THE WORST PRESIDENT AMERICA HAS EVER HAD.
>> Jon: THE WORST EVER IN YOUR LIFETIME ON RECORD EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER.
AND ON THE EVE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, THE BEST, MOST EXPLOSIVE CRITIQUE THAT YOU COULD DELIVER OF THE WORST
PRESIDENT WE HAVE EVER HAD IN THIS COUNTRY IS TREATING US TO SOME REANIMATED [BLEEPED] VIDEO ALREADY BEEN SEEN AS THOUGH IT
WERE THE RODNEY KING TAPE
