MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THEWASHINGTON EDITOR OF
HARPER'S MAGAZINE, ALSO ANAUTHOR.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "KILLCHAIN: THE RISE OF THE HIGH TECH
ASSASSINS."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM ANDREW COCKBURN.
(APPLAUSE)SIR! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: TELL US, TELL US,WHAT IS, WHAT IS KILL CHAIN.
WHAT IS THE KILL CHAIN?
>> THAT'S ALL THE THINGS YOUHAVE TO GO THROUGH, OR THE
MILITARY GOES THROUGH, IT'STHEIR TERM, THEY USE IT ALL
THE TIME, FROM WHEN YOUDECIDE YOU'RE GOING TO KILL
SOMEONE OR GONNA COMMIT SOMEACT OF DESTRUCTION.
AND YOU HAVE TO GET THE, YOUKNOW, THE PLAY ON STATION, YOU
GO THROUGH ALL THE PROCEDURES.
AND THEN FINALLY THREE, FOUR,TWO, ONE AND YOU BLOW THEM
AWAY.
>> Jon: IF YOU GET THE OKAY.
AND YOU SAY THERE WERE CERTAINRULES THAT ARE DIFFERENT
LIKE IF THEY THOUGHT 30CIVILIANS MIGHT DIE OR IF THEY
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I GUESS THEOLD RULE --
>> WELL, UP TO 29 YOU WERE COOL.>> Jon: YES.
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ASKANYONE.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE TOASK ANYBODY UP TO 29 CIVILIANS.
>> THAT'S FINE. 30 YOU HAVE TOASK PERMISSION.
IN THE IRAQ WAR, THEINVASION OF IRAQ IT WAS DONALD
RUMSFELD, BUT IN NO CASESTHAT WE KNOW OF DID HE SAY
NO.
SO IT WAS REALLY KIND OF PROFORMA.
>> Jon: REALLY? HE SEEMS SOTHOUGHTFUL.
>> YEAH, BUT HE, HE,HE'S A VERY CEREBRAL FELLOW.
>> Jon: YES, VERY CEREBRAL.
YOU WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULDTHINK I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU TRACE IT BACK TO THERISE OF THIS SORT OF IDEA OF
DRONE TECHNOLOGY, TO VIETNAM,JUST ANOTHER SUCCESS FROM THE
VIETNAM ERA.
>> REALLY, YEAH. THEY, WELL THEWHOLE IDEA OF REMOTE, REMOTE
CONTROL AUTOMATED WARFARE.
AND THEY HAD THIS BRILLIANTIDEA, THE PROBLEM WAS THE ENEMY
KEPT BEING REINFORCED ON THE HOCHI MINH TRAIL.
SO THEY THOUGHT A-HA, WE'LL PUTELECTRONIC SENSORS, THOUSANDS OF
THEM, ACROSS THE JUNGLE THATCAN HEAR PEOPLE, SENSE THEIR
MOVEMENTS, SMELL THEIR URINEAND THESE WILL ALL BE SENDING
BACK RADIO SIGNALS TO AGIANT COMPUTER IN THAILAND
WHICH WILL THEN DIRECTPLANES AND DRONES TO GO AND
BLOW THEM AWAY.
>> Jon: NOW THERE WAS ONEJUST VERY MINOR, VERY MINOR
FLAW IN THIS GREAT PLAN.
WELL, TWO REALLY, BUT WHAT WERETHOSE?
>> WELL, THE BIGGEST FLAW,REALLY, WAS THE ENEMY
NOTICED WHAT WAS GOING ON.
IT'S YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ONE OFTHOSE ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPENS.
>> Jon: YES.
>> SO THEY FOR INSTANCE THEURINE, I MEAN, WHICH IS THE
SMELL OF AMMONIA, SO THEY SAIDWELL GOSH, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
WHEN WE TAKE A PISS, SOTHEY'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW
ZERO IN ON US SO THEYWERE HANGING BUCKETS OF URINE
SORT OF WAY UP IN THE JUNGLE,MILES, HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY,
THUS DISTRACTING THE SENSORS ANDTHE BOMBERS AND ALL THAT.
AND THERE WAS MORE OF THAT.
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ACOMPLETE BUST.
>> Jon: YES. AND ULTIMATELYDIDN'T EVEN END UP USING
THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL,USED TO GO AROUND I GUESS
AND USE A WATERROUTE.
>> RIGHT. OR ANYTHING ELSE. IMEAN, IT REALLY FELL APART AFTER
A FEW YEARS WHEN SUDDENLY THENORTH VIETNAMESE LAUNCHED A
HUGE OFFENSIVE IN SOUTHVIETNAM WITH THOUSANDS OF
TANKS AND TRUCKS ANDARMOURED VEHICLES WHICH THE
FAMOUS ELECTRONIC FENCE, ASTHEY CALLED IT, HAD GIVEN NO
INDICATION WAS COMING ATALL.
SO THEY SAID, HOW DID THATHAPPEN, YOU KNOW
THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY FUTILE.
SO FINALLY, I MEAN, THE FINALSORT OF LAST CHAPTER IT WAS,
SOMEONE BROUGHT BACK ATAPE FROM THIS GIANT
ENTERPRISE, BROUGHT IT BACK TOTHE STATES, A COMMEMORATIVE
TAPE, AND THEY USED TOPLAY IT AT PENTAGON PARTIES
FOR YEARS AFTERWARDS WHICHWAS THE SOUND, THE UNMISTAKABLE
SOUND OF SOMEONE TAKING A LONGAND LEISURELY PISS ON A SENSOR.
>> Jon: OH JESUS. NOW YOU WOULDHAVE THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD
SOMEWHAT DISCOURAGE THISIDEA, AND I'M WONDERING, AND
I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK OFTHIS.
IF IT IS A CYNICAL PURSUIT,SORT OF A FEEDING OF THE
MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXOR IS THERE AN INNOCENCE TO
THIS, A SORT OF NAIVEFEELING THAT WE CAN THROUGH
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTCREATE A RISKLESS WAR THAT
IS PRECISE, THAT'S NEVERHARMED CIVILIANS AND WE ARE
NEVER IN HARMS AWAY.
>> EXACTLY. I MEAN, WHAT THEY --
THE DREAM, WHICH YOU KNOW, OURPOLITICAL LEADERS GET SOLD ON
AND MILITARY LEADERS TOO.
AND WHAT THEY I THINK THEYSINCERELY BELIEVE IN OR WHAT
THEY ARE LOOKINGFOR IS CERTAINTY.
THE IDEA THAT IT'S GOING TOBE POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE
WONDERS OF COMPUTERPROCESSING AND ALL THE REST,
THAT YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING, YOUCAN KNOW EVERYTHING, AND
THEREFORE YOU CAN SORT OFMAKE IT ALL PREDICTABLE.
YOU KNOW, WE KNOW ABSOLUTELYWHO THE KINGPIN ON THE OTHER
SIDE IS.
WE CAN FIND HIM.
WE KNOW HE'S YOU KNOW IN CHARGEOF EVERYTHING.
AND WE CAN HIT HIM AN GETRID OF HIM AND THEN LIFE
WILL BE EASY.
AND THAT'S-- YOU KNOW, THATWOULD BE NICE.
>> Jon: AND YOU SHOW THOUGHHOW EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE
THEY KILL THE HEAD OF ANORGANIZATION AND IT TURNS
OUT THE GUY RIGHT BEHIND HIM,THE VICE HEAD TURNS OUT TO BE
MUCH MEANER AND YOUNGER ANDWORSE THAN THAT GUY.
>> IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.
IT'S ODD, IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST THAT WECAN THINK OF EXAMPLES AND PLUCK
THEM OUT OF THE AIR.
THERE WAS A SPECIAL MILITARYINTELLIGENCE UNIT IN MILITARY
HEADQUARTERS IN BAGHDAD, IN2007 THAT DID A STUDY, THAT A
BRILLIANT ANALYST CALLED REXRIVOLO SAID I WONDER IF THIS
REALLY WORKS.
SO HE TOOK A LIST OF 200PEOPLE THEY'D KILLED, LOCAL
INSURGENT LEADERS.
AND THEN HE LOOKED TO SEEWHAT HAPPENED IN THEIR AREA
OF OPERATIONS.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW-- .
>> Jon: AFTER THE KILL,AFTER THE DRONE STRIKE.
>> YEAH. HE'S KILLED ON THEMONDAY WHAT IS HAPPENING ON
WEDNESDAY?
WELL, IT TURNS OUT BY WEDNESDAY,ATTACKS ON AMERICANS ARE UP
40%.
SO MANY AMERICANS DIED,EXTRA, I MEAN, MORE AMERICANS,
IT TURNED OUT, DIED AS A RESULTOF THIS WHAT THEY CALL THE
HIGH VALUE TARGET STRATEGY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
CAUSE THEY FIGURED THE NEW GUYWAS IN THERE LIKE I'VE GOT TO
PROVE MY BONES. I'M GONNA, I'MGONNA RATCHET IT UP.
>> HE'S YOUNGER, HE'S OFTENA RELATIVE, WANTS TO AVENGE
UNCLE AHKMED.>> Jon: RIGH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> AND HE'S JUST GOT TOPROVE HIMSELF.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> AND IT TURNS OUT THAT'S WHATHAPPENS.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. STICK AROUNDFOR LIKE TWO SECONDS AND THEN
WE'LL EXPLAIN WHERE WETHINK THIS IS GOING.
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE IN THEAIR WITH A REMOTE CONTROL.
"KILL CHAIN," IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, ANDREW COCKBURN,
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE.
