>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FILMMAKER
EUGENE JARECKI.
THE NEW MOVIE ABOUT THE WAR ON
DRUGS.
FOR THE MANY WARS AMERICA IS
CURRENTLY FIGHTING, THE ALONG
WITH THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS, WAR
ON WOMEN AND THERE'S ONE MORE --
IT WILL COME TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AFGHANISTAN, I THINK, I DON'T
KNOW.
CHRISTMAS IS THE BIG ONE.
OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT WAS THE SECOND
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WHICH I
TOTALLY WATCHED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND IT'S NOT TAKING PLACE UNTIL
THREE HOURS AFTER WE TAPE THE
SHOW.
I CAN'T BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY CUT
OFF OBAMA'S HAND AND THEN TOLD
HIM HE WAS HIS FATHER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FIRST, ELECTION DAY THREE WEEKS
AWAY.
OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY, I
CANNOT BELIEVE THIS THING IS
STILL THREE WEEKS AWAY.
WE EXAMINE THE NATION'S
EMOTIONAL STATE IN THE NATION'S
NEW SEGMENT "PLEASE FOR THE LOVE
OF GOD, MAKE IT STOP."
CONTROVERSY ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT.
VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PAUL
RYAN AT A CAMPAIGN STOP IN
GEORGIA -- KIDDING HE WAS IN
OHIO.
IS THERE ANOTHER STATE OTHER
THAN (bleep) OHIO?
NOT IN OCTOBER THERE ISN'T.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RYAN SEEN HERE IN PHOTOS HE FOR
SOME REASON SIGNED A RELEASE
FOR --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- OR PERHAPS THESE ARE OUTTAKES
FROM HIS REAL WORLD AUDITION
TAPE.
ANYHOO HE WAS CAMPAIGNING WHEN
HE DECIDED TO VOLUNTEER AT A
HOMELESS SHELTER.
ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.
>> ACCORDING TO THE CHARITY'S
PRESIDENT THE CANDIDATE WAS
WASHING PANS THAT WERE ALREADY
CLEANED.
AND ONLY AFTER THE PATRONS HAD
LEFT THE PLACE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS TO MAKE VOLUNTEERING AT A
HOMELESS SHELTER LOOK LIKE A
NEGATIVE THING AND HOW DEAD
INSIDE DOES A NATIONAL
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MAKE YOU
THAT YOU COULD BE HANDED CLEAN
DISHES AND INSTEAD OF SAYING,
YOU KNOW THESE ARE CLEAN RIGHT,
YOU GO, WHERE IS MY SCRUBBY
SPONGE.
THERE'S MORE.
>> AS WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW THERE
WERE DIRTY DISHES LEFT FOR HIM.
IT WAS ORIGINALLY REPORTED THEY
WERE CLEAN.
OUR TEAM IS REPORTING DIRTY
DISHES.
>> Jon: GREAT WORK, TEAM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE STATUS OF
THESE DISHES LATER ON IN THE
PROGRAM.
APPARENTLY RYAN DID WASH DISHES
BUT THEY WERE SET ASIDE AND LEFT
UNCLEAN SPECIFICALLY SO THEY
COULD TAKE PICTURES OF HIM
SELFLESSLY WASHING SO SO THAT
WE -- BECAUSE WE'RE SO DO YOU
MEAN -- BELIEVE HE WAS CAUGHT IN
THE ACT OF VOLUNTEERING.
LATER FOOD WAS HELD FROM NURSING
HOME PATIENTS SO RYAN COULD AL
RIFF AND REANIMATE THEM THROUGH
THE MAGIC OF APPLESAUCE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN CYNICAL HELP IS HELP FOR
THE SHELTER.
>> THE HEAD OF THE FAITH-BASED
ORGANIZATION TOLD THE POST NO
POLITICIANS HAVE PERMISSION TO
STAGE EVENTS EVENTS.
HE ACCUSED THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN
OF QUOTE "RAMRODDING ITS WAY
INTO THE BUILDING."
>> Jon: YOU BROKE INTO A
HOMELESS SHELTER TO TAKE A
PICTURE OF YOU MAYBE OR MAYBE
NOT WASHING ALREADY CLEAN
DISHES?
ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO
MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS
THROUGH PREFABRICATED SCENARIOS
PUT SOME OOMPH INTO IT.
THAT'S THE SOCIAL CONTRACT
BETWEEN YOU AND THE VOTERS.
IF YOU DON'T GIVE A (bleep)
ABOUT YOU THE HOMELESS GIVE A
(bleep) THAT YOU GAVE A
(bleep).
DON'T PHONE IN CYNICISM.
IT'S LIKE JOE BIDEN PUTTING A
HARD HAT AND GOGGLES AND POSING
IN FRONT OF A CHEESECAKE
FACTORY.
HE'S LIKE, (ble
