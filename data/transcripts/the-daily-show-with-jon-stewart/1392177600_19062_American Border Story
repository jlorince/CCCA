SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO DEALWITH IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: JUST GOT A BUTT
TICKLE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PASS THENACHOS, I THINK THIS IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THIS IS AMAZING AFTER DECADES OFTRYING TO REFORM WHAT EVERYONE
ACKNOWLEDGES IS A BROKENIMMIGRATION SYSTEM, THE LEADERS
OF BOTH PARTIES AGREE THAT NOWIS THE RIGHT TIME.
>> ALL THE PUNDITS ARE SAYINGTHIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.
>> COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATIONREFORM SHOULD HAPPEN JUST NOTRIGHT
NOW.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU TALKINGABOUT BOLDEN.
FOR GOD SAKES WHY NOT?
>> THE PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATICPARTY WILL GET CREDIT AND
FURTHER BOLSTER THEIR HISPANICVOTE.
>> Jon: WHO CARES WHO GETSCREDIT -- FINE HOW WE CALL THE
BILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTYPRESENTS THE ONLY WE LOVE
HISPANICS ACT ANO 2014.
DOES THAT DO IT.
>> THE LAST THING ANY OF THESENATE REPUBLICANS FACINGPRIMARIES WANT IS TO OPEN UP
THE IMMIGRATION CAN OF WORMS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULDOBVIOUSLY ALIENATE THEIR BASE.
>> I THINK IT'S THE ONE THINGTHAT COULD COST REPUBLICANS THE
SENATE.
>> Jon: YES, IMMIGRATIONREFORM MIGHT ALIENATE SOME OF
YOUR BASE BUT MIGHT EMBASEN SOMEOF THE ALIENS.
REPUBLICANS COULD WIN SOMEHISPANIC SUPPORT BUT WOULD YOU
RATHER CATER TO THE VOTERS WHOWILL BE DEAD BEFORE YOU CAN SAY
THE WORD CHIPOTLE.
DAMN YOUR CYNICISM PUNDITS THISISN'T ABOUT POLITICS.
MARCO RUBIO.
>> WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUEBECAUSE THIS IS WHO WE ARE.
WE ARE THE MOST COMPASSIONATENATION ON EARTH.
WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WELCOMEDPEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THEWORLD FOR OVER
200 YEARS, EACH OF US THE DIRECTDESCENDANTS OF IMMIGRANTS HAVE
CREATED THE SINGLE GREATESTSOCIETY MAN HAS EVER KNOWN.

TIME.
THE GREATEST NATION 200 YEARS --JUST THE EASTERN EUROPEANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT HAPPENED?
>> THERE'S WIDESPREAD DOUBTABOUT WHETHER THIS
ADMINISTRATION CAN BE TRUSTED TOENFORCE OUR LAWS.
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULTTO MOVE ANY IMMIGRATION
LEGISLATION UNTIL THAT CHANGES.
>> Jon: HOW DID WE GO FROMTHIS IS THE TIME TO DEAL WITH
THIS IN TWO WEEKS THE PRESIDENTDOESN'T ENFORCE THE LAWS OF
AMERICA.
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THEPRESIDENT CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO
ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE LANDBECAUSE THAT'S HIS WHOLE JOB.
OUT OF ALL THE CONSTITUTIONALARTICLES THAT'S LIKE THE SECOND
ONE.
THAT'S RIGHT, I HAVE ACONSTITUTION -- I JUST READ IT
FOR THE ARTICLES.
[ LAUGHTER ]FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS -- FOR
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS TO SUGGESTTHAT THEY WILL NOT ENTERTAIN
IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE THEYDON'T TRUST THIS PRESIDENT TO
ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE LAND ISPERHAPS THE GREATEST PROJECTION
IN THE HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY.
I GIVE YOU THIS REPUBLICANCONGRESS'S RECORD OF ENFORCING
ENACTED LAW.
>> REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED 48TIMES TO REPEAL OBAMACARE.
>> THEY ARE MOVING TO MAKE THEIMPLEMENTATION OF IT HARDER.THEY
VOTE TO CUT DODD FRANK.
>> THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUSHED ARECORD NUMBER OF FILIBUSTERS
REPUBLICANS BLOCKED PRESIDENTOBAMA'S EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL
NOMINATIONS.
>> REPUBLICANS BLOCKEDAPPOINTMENTS AS MATTERS OF
GENERAL PRINCIPAL.
>> Jon: THE G.O.P. SAYING THEYDON'T TRUST THE THE PRESIDENT'S
ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW ISLIKE BOB COSTAS SAYING I DON'T
WANT TO BORROW YOUR GLASSES.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'VE BEEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]THE WORST PART OF THISCYNICAL GOVERNANCE, INSTEAD OFHAVING A REAL
CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE ADISINGENUOUS-OFF.
>> THEY WANT IMMIGRATION REFORMBUT THEY DON'T TRUST THE
PRESIDENT TO ENFORCE THE LAW,PARTICULARLY THE ENFORCEMENT
PARTS.
LET'S ENACT THE LAW THIS YEARBUT SIMPLY NOT LET IT START
UNTIL 2017 AFTER PRESIDENTOBAMA'S TERM IS OVER.
>> Jon: NOW THIS IS THE KINDOF PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY
OUR FOUNDERS INTENDED.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T --[LAUGHTER]
[ APPLAUSE ]-- YOU KNOW, WE GET TOGETHER IN
ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECTUNION BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK
THIS UNION IS PERFECT,EHH, YOULIKE TO FORM YOUR OWN UNION?
[LAUGHTER]WHAT SAY YOU, NOW, JOHN BOEHNER?
>> SPEAKER BOEHNER'S OFFICEREJECTED THE IDEA.
BOEHNER SPOKESMAN MICHAEL STEELESAID IT WAS ENTIRELY IMPRACTICAL
AND WOULD ELIMINATE ANYINCENTIVE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TOENFORCE THE
LAWS DURING THE REMAINDER OF HISSECOND TERM.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THISSTRAIGHT.
WE HAVE AN URGENT ISSUE,IMMIGRATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT
STRIKES AT THE HEART OF WHO WEARE AS A PEOPLE THAT WE MUST
SOLVE BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE THEONLY WAY TO KEEP THE PRESIDENT
ENFORCING OUR CURRENT DISASTROUSIMMIGRATION LAW IS TO TALK ABOUT
BUT NOT DELIVER A BETTER ONE.
