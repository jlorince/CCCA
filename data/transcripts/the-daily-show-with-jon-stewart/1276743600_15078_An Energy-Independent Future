SHOW!
OBVIOUSLY BEYOND ADDRESSING THE
CLEAN UP OF THE OIL IN THE GULF.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH HAD A
LARGER GOAL.
>> FOR DECADES WE HAVE KNOWN THE
DAYS OF CHEAP AND EASILY
ACCESSIBLE OIL WERE NUMBERED.
NOW IS THE MOMENT FOR THIS
GENERATION TO EMBARK ON A
NATIONAL MISSION TO UNLEASH
AMERICA'S INNOVATION AND SEIZE
CONTROL OF OUR OWN DESTINY.
>> Jon:.
♪ I BELIEVE WE CAN FLY USING
NONPETROLEUM BASED TECHNOLOGY OR
GIANT MAGNETS HAVING HAMSTERS
RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY OR SOME
OTHER TYPE OF ENERGY SOURCE WE
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT YET ♪
NOW IS THE MOMENT TO
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE OUR
ENVIRONMENT AND MOVE BEYOND A
PETROLEUM BASED ECONOMY.
UNLIKE IN 2006 --
>> THIS COUNTRY CAN DRAMATICALLY
IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENT, MOVE
BEYOND A PETROLEUM BASED ECONOMY
AND MAKE OUR DEPENDENCE ON
MIDDLE EASTERN OIL A THING OF
THE PAST.
>> Jon: BACK THEN IN 2006 WE
DIDN'T DO IT.
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE THAT GOT US INTO WAR.
NOW IT'S TWO WARS AND A GIANT
SPILL.
THAT IS THE PUSH WE NEEDED.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL KNOW I DON'T KNOW TWO WARS
AND A GIANT SPILL IS AN AWFUL
LOT TO OVERCOME AND GET OFF THE
OIL THING.
I WISH WE HAD TAKEN CARE OF THIS
ENERGY PROBLEM TEN YEARS AGO
WHEN THERE WAS NO WAR AND THE
ECONOMY WAS GREAT.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT
TIME TO DEVELOP A LONG-TERM
ENERGY STRATEGY.
>> WE NEED A LONG-TERM ENERGY
STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE
CONSERVATION AND THE ALTERNATIVE
SOURCES OF ENERGY.
>> Jon: AND WE WOULD HAVE DONE
IT, TOO, IF HE HADN'T GOTTEN
DISTRACTED BY THAT OTHER SPILL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHICH I SHOULD ADD ALSO TOOK
FIVE AND A HALF MILES OF BOOM
AND THE NAVY TO CLEAN UP.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM THE
BIG DOG.
IF ONLY THE GUY BEFORE CLINTON
HAD THOUGHT OF THIS.
>> THERE'S NO SECURITY FOR THE
UNITED STATES IN FURTHER
DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YES, AND HE WOULD HAVE
DONE IT, TOO, IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR THESE SHOW
ON FOREIGN OIL.
>> NEW STANDBY EMERGENCY
PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE THE
INDEPENDENCE WE WANT.
>> WE'LL BREAK THE BACK OF THE
ENERGY CRISIS.
WE'LL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR
FUTURE CAPACITY TO MEET
AMERICA'S ENERGY NEEDS FROM
AMERICA'S OWN RESOURCES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON
YOU.
FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME.
FOOL ME EIGHT TIMES, AM I A
(bleep) IDIOT?
I MUST BE AN IDIOT.
COUNTING BARACK OBAMA, THE LAST
8 PRESIDENT HAVE GONE ON
TELEVISION AND PROPLZED TO US --
PROMISED TO MOVE US TOWARDS AN
ENERGY INDEPENDENT FUTURE.
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK?
WHY COULDN'T WE DO IT?
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE
GOOD IDEAS.
>> WIND TURBINE, SOLAR ENERGY.
>> ENERGY EFFICIENT WINDOWS.
>> ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES.
>> NATURAL GAS.
HYDRO.
>> AMERICAN COAL.
>> ETHANOL NOT JUST FROM COARN.
>> ATOMIC POWER.
>> WOOD CHIPS, SWITCH GRASS.
>> NATURAL GAS.
>> ZERO EMISSION COAL FIRED PLAN
PLANTS.
>> SOLAR PANELS.
>> BETTER BATTERIES.
>> METHANOL, ETHANOL.
>> PLANT PRODUCTS FOR GASAHOL.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: (bleep) IT.
LET'S JUST USE OIL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE TO.
I WILL NOT ALLOW THE DINOSAURS
TO HAVE DIED IN VAIN.
SO WE HAVE GOOD IDEAS AND WE'RE
GOOD PEOPLE.
>> WE HAVE THE WORLD'S HIGHEST
LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY.
>> WE HAVE THE KNOW HOW.
>> WE HAVE THE ABILITY.
>> OUR UNYIELDING FAITH.
>> WORTHY OF A GREAT NATION.
>> WE HAVE THE MOST SKILLED WORK
FORCE.
>> WE'RE RESILIENT.
>> AMERICA IS SAY RISING NATION.
>> Jon: WE'RE AN UNSTOPPABLE
OIL DEPENDENCY BREAKING MACHINE.
FORTUNATELY -- UNFORTUNATELY THE
MACHINE RUNS ON OIL BUT --
BUT -- IT'S MADDENING.
MADE WE NEED A DEADLINE HARD AND
FAST LIKE THE MOON.
IN TEN YEARS WE'LL GO TO THE
MOON AND IN TEN MORE YEARS BE
SOMEWHAT BORED BY DOING SO.
[LAUGHTER]
WE JUST NEED THE FROZE LAY OUT
REASONABLE TIME PARAMEET
CANNERS.
>> AT THE END OF THIS DECADE IN
THE YEAR 1980, THE UNITED STATES
WILL NOT BE DEPENDENT ON ANY
OTHER COUNTRY FOR THE ENERGY WE
NEED.
>> BY 1985.
>> BY THE YEAR 2000.
>> WITHIN A MATTER OF THREE OR
FOUR YEARS IF WE'LL GET AFTER IT
AND TREAT IT LIKE IT'S
IMPORTANT.
>> ANOTHER GREAT GOAL TO REPLACE
75% OF THE OIL IMPORTS FROM THE
MIDDLE EAST BY 2025.
>> Jon: SO NIXON SAYS LET'S
GET OFF FOREIGN OIL BY 1980
WHICH SOMEHOW BECOMES LET'S NOT
USE AS MUCH FOREIGN OIL BY 2025.
WE HAVE REDEFINED SUCCESS AND
STILL FAILED.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH BRINGS US TO PERHAPS THE
STRANGEST ASPECT OF THIS SAD,
SOME WOULD SAY GROUNDHOG DAYISH
SAGA.
OF ALL THESE EIGHT MEN WHO TRIED
AND FAILED TO GET US OFF OF OIL,
ONE STANDS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
ABOVE THE OTHERS AS FAR AS DOING
SOMETHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
WHO?
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.
WHAT HAS FOUR FINGERS AND
RESIGNED IN DISGRACE?
THIS GUY.
HE CREATED THE E.P.A.
HE SIGNED A CLEAN WATER ACT OF
19712, THE MARINE MAMMAL
PROTECTION ACT.
WHEN THE COY CUE HOEGA RIVER -S
WAS ON FIRE HE PUT IT OUT WITH
HIS OWN URINE BUT EVEN NIXON
COULDN'T GET US OFF OIL.
AND THIS WAS A GUY, BY THE WAY,
WHO WAS NOT AFRAID TO BEND THE
RULES TO GET THINGS DONE.
COULDN'T GET IT DONE.
NIXON HAD ONE MAJOR FLAW.
NOT HE WAS AN OLD PARANOIA
LIVING IN A -- YOU KNOW WHY HE
COULDN'T GET IT DONE?
>> WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW
SYSTEM THAT MAKES HIGH QUALITY
HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO EVERY
AMERICAN IN A TK *EUG HIGH INNED
