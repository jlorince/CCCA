WE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR DAYHONESTLY IN SHOCK AND GRIEF BUT
ALSO SEARCHING FOR A SEGUE.
BACK IN TO A PROGRAM SUCH ASTHIS.
AND YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT BUTWE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE FOUND
IT, IT'S A STORY THAT COMBINESDIFFICULTY OF RIDDING SOCIETY OF
THESE TYPES OF PERSISTENT,TOXIC IDEOLOGIES.
IT COMBINES THAT WITH A CREATURETHAT HAS FOUR STOMACHS.
WE MOVE FORWARD TONIGHT WITH ASEGMENT WE CALL NAZI COWS.
>> A BRITISH FARMER HAS HAD TOPUT DOWN MOST OF HIS CATTLE HERD
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY WERE TOOAGGRESSIVE.
>> KNOWN AS NAZI COWS, THEY WEREORIGINALLY BRED AS A MASTER RACE
OF BELLIGERENT BOVINES.
[ Laughter ]>> YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEARCH LONG
ENOUGH IN A PILE OF HORSE[BLEEP] OUR GOING TO FIND A
HORSE. NAZI COWS.
BY THE WAY IS THAT REALLY THEMOST EVOCATIVE IMAGE WE CAN
HAVE FOR THIS?THERE YOU GO.
COMEDY!
NAZI COWS!
NOW COWS!
WHO ARE NAZIS!
AND BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT JUSTCALLING THESE NAZI COWS THE WAY
SEINFELD HAD, SEINFELD HAD SOUPNAZI OR LINDA IN H.R. IS A
REAL NAZI ABOUT GETTING YOURTIMESHEET FILLED OUT PROPERLY.
THESE COWS ARE ACTUAL NAZIS.
>> THE HECK CATTLE WEREDELIBERATELY CREATED BY NAZI
GENETIC EXPERTS. KEEN HUNTSMAN,HERMANN GORING HERE
WANTED AN ICONIC AND AGGRESSIVEBREED
WHICH COULD ROAM FREELY ACROSSEUROPE LIKE THE AUROCHS OF OLD.
>> HERMANN GOERINGAUROCH-LIKE NAZI COWS!
SOUNDS LIKE THE ABSOLUTEWORST POSSIBLE KNOCKOFF OF THE
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLESFRANCHISE.
[ Laughter ]NOW YOU MAY ASSUME NAZI COWS,
LIKE ALL COWS, WOULD BE EASY TOGET RID OF.
WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE SLEEPING SENDIN TIP TEAM SIX. AND UH -- WHAT
I'M SAYING IS THESE COWS ARE NOTGOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
>> IF I WAS STANDING HEREAND SOME OF THE MORE AGGRESSIVE
ONES WERE IN THISFIELD AND THEY COULD SEE ME,
THEN THEY WOULD COME RIGHTACROSS NOW AND TRY TO KILL YOU.
>> TRY TO KILL YOU?
>> OH ABSOLUTELY, YES. YEAH.THEY HAVE EVERY INTENTION
OF WIPING YOU FROM THEFACE OF THIS EARTH.
>> THAT'S HOW DELUSIONAL THESETYPES OF IDEOLOGIES ARE.
THE NAZIS WERE DEFEATED MANY,MANY YEARS AGO.
IT'S 2015, THEY'RE IN A PEN,THEY'RE [BLEEP] COWS.
THEY DON'T HAVE THUMBS.
AND THEY STILL THINK THEY CANWIN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
WHAT DIABOLICAL SCHEME DIDHITLER HAVE PLANNED FOR THESE
UBER-MOOO-NSCHES?
>> THE IDEA OF GREEK HEROES LIKEHERCULES WRESTLING THE AUROCHS
IS SORT OF WRIT LARGE INCLASSICAL MYTHOLGY
AND THE NAZIS WANTEDA PART OF THAT.
YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED THE NAZISUPERMEN TO BE ABLE, TO SORT OF,
YOU KNOW BEST THEMSELVES AGAINSTTHESE KIND OF CREATURES IN A
SORT OF POST WAR GERMANY.
>> Jon: LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IFANYONE HAS POINTED THIS OUT
BEFORE, BUT THE NAZISOBVIOUSLY WERE A LITTLE CUCKOO.
I MEAN, LET'S BREED A RACE OFSUPER COWS IS CRAZY.
LET'S BREED A RACE OF SUPER COWSSO WE CAN WRESTLE THEM IS A
WHOLE OTHER PLANET OF NUTS.
IT STRIKES ME, PEOPLE HAVEALWAYS WONDERED,
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IFHITLER HAD WON THE WAR,
WELL, NOW WE KNOW CHANNING TATUMWOULD BE STARRING IN A VERY
DIFFERENT MOVIE.
YOU KNOW, THE IMPORTANT THING IS--
