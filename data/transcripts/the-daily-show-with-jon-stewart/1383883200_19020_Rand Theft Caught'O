SUPPOSED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUTSUIS THAT RAND PAUL IS COPYING
FROM WIKIPEDIA AND NOT THATHE'S WARNING AMERICANS ABOUT THE
ROLE OF GOVERNMENT BYREFERENCING AN ETHAN HAWKE
MOVIE.
YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THISCOUNTRY NEEDS IS A PLACE WHERE
ROOKIE COPS HAVE BETTERCE WHERETRAINING. AND
ONE DAY A YEAR CRIME IS LEGALAND WHERE -- UM --
[LAUGHTER]DAYS ARE BROKEN.

WHERE THE FINEST THINGS COMEFROM BROOKLYN AND I HAVE NO
(bleep) IDEA.
I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER -- HOW MANY OF THESE --ALL RIGHT.
A LOT OF MOVIES I HAVEN'T SEENYET.
AS FAR AS PLAGIARISM GOES ANDI'M SURE THERE'S A REASONABLE
EXPLANATION.
>> I THINK THE SPOKEN WORDSHOULDN'T BE HELD TO THE SAME
SORT OF STANDARD THAT YOU HAVEIF YOU ARE GIVING A SCIENTIFIC
PAPER.

CLEAR THAT MR. PAUL HAS STOLENHIS HAIRCUT FROM
80'S ICON PATRICK DUFFY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
AT LEAST THE RAND MAN ISHANDLING THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE
APPROPRIATE MANNER.

HATERS.

IF THEY ARE TIRED OF ME I'LL GOBACK TO BE A DOCTOR AND I'LL BE
PERFECTLY CONTENT.
