ARCTIC AND A FORTRESS OFNEWSITUDE ERUPTED FROM THE
ICE. SOON YOU'LL BE TAKINGORDERS FROM A GIANT HEAD.
MY SON, YOU MUST GO LIVE AMONGSTTHE PEOPLE OF FOX THOUGH YOU ARE
NEVER FULLY ONE OF THEM BECAUSEYOUR SHOW IS ON IN THE AFTERNOON
WHEN YOU ARE MARGINALLY LESSIDEALOGICAL.
SHEP SMITH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLEAT FOX I LIKE VERY MUCH.
I THINK HE IS VERY GOOD.
I THINK I SHOULD GIVE HIM THEBENEFIT OF THE DOUBT EVEN IF HIS
NEW DIGS DO LOOK LIKE AN APPLEGENIUS BAR HAD AN ORGASM.
SPAWNING THE WORLD'S MOSTRIDICULOUSLY LARGE iPAD. DO
YOU KNOW HOW MAD THE GIANT YOUTOOK THOSE FROM IS GOING TO
BE?

THAT GUY IS LOSING ALL HIS STUFFTODAY.
WHAT MARVELS DOES THENEWS-ATARIUM BOAST BEYOND TOUCH
SCREENS.
THIS IS WHAT REMAINS OF TROPICALSTORM KAREN.
>> Jon: WOW.
THAT'S A BIG MAP.
YOU DO KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOWHUGE YOU BLOW UP YOUR MAPS AND
MONITORS FOR US OUR TELEVISIONSARE THE SAME SIZE BECAUSE WE
STILL HAVE THE SAME TVS WE HADLAST WEEK.
YOU COULD BE STANDING INFRONT OF AN IMAX BUT TO ME IT'S

WE'RE ABLE TO VET MUCH OF THISFOR YOU.
>> Jon: SO IT'S ALL FORREPORTING
NOTHING THAT YOUSAID REALLY COULDN'T BE DONE
USING A PHONE.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THE PROBLEM AT FOX NEWS HAS
NEVER BEEN ITS SCREENS.
REMEMBER KARL ROVE'S WHITE BOARDOR GLENN BECK'S CHALK BOARD.
NO ONE EVER LOOKED AT THOSE GUYSAND THOUGHT THEY ARE (bleep)
CRAZY TO BE USING SUCHANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY.
[ LAUGHTER ]THEY WERE JUST (bleep).
[LAUGHTER]BUT LISTEN, THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY
DOESN'T HAPPEN A VALUEDSKEPTICAL TO THE DETRIMENT OF
EDITORIAL JUDGMENT DOES IT?
>> WHAT IT ALLOWS ME TO DO ISSCROLL THROUGH THE MEDIA OF
THE DAY.
THIS IS A -- THIS HAPPENS TO BEA PALESTINIAN WOMAN WHO IS
HAVING A BEEF WITH AN ISRAELISOLDIER AND THIS
TONY ROMO LAST NIGHT 506YARDS PASSING AND MANAGED TO
LOSE.
THERE WAS A LATE PICK BUT WHAT AGAME.
>> Jon: TWO QUICK THINGS:TUPAC AND
BIGGIE HAD A BEEF.
THE PALESTINIAN ISRAELI CONFLICTIS MORE OF A BOTTOMLESS CUP OF
SADNESS.
WHILE THE COWBOYS LOSS ON SUNDAYMAY HAVE BEEN TRAGIC TO SOME, I
DON'T THINK THOSE PICTURESSHOULD BE NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
THIS IS WHY I'M WORRIED SHEPHERDSMITH, THIS IS WHAT WORRIES ME.
THE GIANT SCREENS ARE LITERALLYFLATTENING OUT THE NEWS.
SUDDENLY NOTHING HAS ANYDIFFERENCE OR CONTEXT.
CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONETO YOU?

THE ONLY SURE FIRE WAY THEY KNOWTO RUIN A REAL NEWS MAN.
THEY PUT YOU IN A SITUATIONROOM.
SHEP YOU'VE BEEN CNNED YOURSTAFF HAS LOST ALL RESPECT FOR
YOU.
EVERY TIME YOU TURN YOUR BACKTHEY ARE PLAYING FRUIT NINJA.
YOU SEE THAT.
SUCH A WASTE OF TIME ANDDELICIOUS FRUIT.
