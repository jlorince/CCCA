>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD SHOWFOR YOU TONIGHT.
BY POPULAR DEMAND, OUR GUESTTONIGHT SOPHIE DELAUNAY THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DOCTORSWITHOUT BOARDERS, SHE IS HERE
TONIGHT TO LOOK AT THISTHING ON MY ANKLE.
A LOVELY COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALAS THEY ALL ARE.
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO FIRST TALKTO YOU NOW ABOUT
PROFESSIONAL FUTBOL.THE AMERICAN BRAND.
IT HAS CERTAINLY SEEN ITS SHAREOF CONTROVERSY THIS YEAR FROM A
GAY PLAYER THAT APPARENTLYCOULDN'T HIT HARD ENOUGH IS
TO A STRAIGHT PLAYER THAT COULDBUT PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE,
SHOULDN'T OF HIT AT ALL, REALLY.TO A TEAM THAT ON PAPER BEFORE
THE SEASON SHOULD OFBEEN IN THE HUNT.
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES, HE'S ATWO TIME SUPERBOWL WINNING MVP.
DO WE HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE, DOWE NOT HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE?
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THEPREDICTION SCHEMES ARE NOT ONLY
ILL-DESIGNED BUT ALSOHILARIOUSLY UNDEREXECUTED?
THE POINT IS THIS [BEEP] ODELLBECKHAM JR., MAN.
OKAY.
NOT A FOOTBALL CROWD.
MORE OF A JOURNALISM CROWD.[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JOURNALISM, NO. UCB, YES.
I GIVE, BY THE WAY, THE WORSTCAREER ADVICE IN THE HISTORY.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
YOU SHOULD YOU DROP OUT OFSCHOOL AND START HANGING OUT
AROUND THAT IMPROV THEATER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, LADY.
ANYWAY MY POINT IS THIS, THEREIS MORE FOOTBALL CONTROVERSY.
>> MEMBERS OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMSCOMING ON THE FIELD WITH AN
UNEXPECTED MESSAGE.
PUTTING THEIR HANDS UP.
DON'T SHOOT.
WHAT'S BECOME A SYMBOL OF THEPROTESTS FOLLOWING FERGUSON.
>> Jon: SYMBOLE OF THE PROTESTS?
IT'S FOOTBALL. I'M PRETTY SURETHEY'RE JUST GOING,
HEY FELLAS LET'S SCORE SOMETOUCH DOWNS.
OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST PREPARINGTO DANCE AT TEVYE'S DAUGHTER'S
WEDDING.
♪ SUBMISSION♪ I'VE GOT NO GUN, SUBMISSION
A RARE INSTANCE OF SOCIALAWARENESS FROM THE NFL.
JOINING IN A COMMON SIGNAL OFSOLIDARITY.
LIKE THAT "HUNGER GAMES" KATNISSTHREE FINGER SALUTE.
OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY THEDISTRICT 11 RESIDENTS WHO HELD
UP THEIR HANDS LIKE THAT WEREIMMEDIATELY ATTACKED BY THE
POLICE, WHICH IS WHEREOUR METAPHOR -- ALRIGHT.
ANYWAY, WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?
>> THE ST. LOUIS COUNTYPOLICE ASSOCIATION CALLING THE
GESTURE TASTELESS, OFFENSIVEAND INFLAMMATORY.
THEY WANT THE NATIONAL FOOTBALLLEAGUE TO APOLOGIZE AND TO
PUNISH THE PLAYERS.
>> TO US IT SEEMS LIKE RATHERTHAN ALLOWING WOUNDS TO HEAL
THAT THEY'RE FOLKS PICKINGAT THE SCABS.
[BOOING]>> Jon: HOLY [BEEP].
SO THE ST. LOUIS POLICEASSOCIATION IS ANGRY AND
OUTRAGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHTIN THIS HAIL OF GESTURES AND
FEELS THAT THE COMMUNITY WON'TGET PAST THIS TRAGIC PANTOMINE
UNLESS SOMEONE ISHELD ACCOUNTABLE.
THAT'S THE ANGLE THEY'RE GOINGWITH.
ALRIGHT.
ST. LOUIS RAMS COACH, JEFFFISHER.
>> THEY WILL NOT BE DISCIPLINEDBY THE CLUB NOR WILL THEY
BE DISCIPLINED BY THENATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
>>Jon: LET ME ASK YOU AQUESTION WHEN DID NICK NOLTE
TAKE OVER THE RAMS.
YEAH, FISHER THAT WILL TEACHYOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING!
A NOLTE JOKE. HE'S A RAGTOPCOACH.
ALRIGHT, SO I GUESS WE'VE GOTOURSELVES AN OLD FASHION POLICE
DEPARTMENT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLTEAM STAND OFF.
WHO IS GOING TO BLINK?
>> THE RAMS CHIEF OPERATINGOFFICER CALLED THE ST. LOUIS
POLICE CHIEF CALLED TOAPOLOGIZE FOR THE RAMS' HANDS UP
DON'T SHOOT GESTURE DURINGSUNDAY'S GAME.
>> Jon: OH, I THOUGHT, ACTUALLYI THOUGHT THEY WERE NOT
GOING TO APOLOGIZE.
>> THE RAMS OFFICIAL, HOWEVER,NOW DENIES APOLOGIZING.
HE SAYS IN PART IN NONE OF THESECONVERSATIONS DID I APOLOGIZE
FOR OUR PLAYERS' ACTIONS.
>> Jon: ISN'T IT INTERESTING HOWWITNESS TESTIMONY IS SO
UNRELIABLE. WELL, HOW CAN WE,HOW CAN WE IN ANY WAY
HOW CAN WE CLEAR THIS UP?
HOW DO WE CLEAR IT UP?
>> IN A TESTY AND BIZARREEXCHANGE OF TWEETS AND
STATEMENTS OVER NIGHT POLICECLAIM THE RAMS APOLOGIZED.
BUT THE RAMS SAID NO.
THEN THE POLICE TWEETED THEDEFINITION OF APOLOGY INCLUDING
WORDS "EXPRESSION OF REGRET."
>> Jon: AND THEN, AND THEN THERAMS TWEETED
WTF POLICE? #UNFOLLOW AND THEN,AND THEN
THE POLICE WERE ALL, THANKSOBAMA #NOTALLCOPS. AND THEN,
AND THEN THE RAMS WERE LIKE THISCOULD BE US, BUT YOU PLAYING.
[LAUGHING]
LISTEN, I SEE THECONFUSION HERE.
THE RAMS MADE THE SORRY IF YOUWERE OFFENDED NON-APOLOGY NOBODY
EVER BELIEVES IS AN ACTUALAPOLOGY AND INSTEAD OF REJECTING
THE NON-APOLOGY OUTRIGHT LIKE ANORMAL GROUP, THE COPS CONFUSED
THINGS EVEN MORE ACCEPTING ITFORCING THE RAMS TO CLARIFY
THE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE NATUREOF THEIR ORIGINAL NON-APOLOGY
WHICH MEANS AT LEAST FINALLY INTHIS COUNTRY
WE'RE HAVING THE IMPORTANTNATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT
SEMANTICS, WE NEED.
