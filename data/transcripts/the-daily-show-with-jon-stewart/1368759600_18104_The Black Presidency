STUPID-- COMEDIAN.
FOR MORE ON THE BATCH OF
2016 CANDIDATES WE'RE JOINED
BY LARRY WILMORE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE
HAVE BEEN SEE ON THE AIR.
HAS THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY
OPENED THE DOOR TO THE OVAL
OFFICE TO OTHER TYPES WE
HAVEN'T SEEN AS PRESIDENT
BEFORE?
WOMEN, OTHER MINORITIES?
>> JON, SURE, EVENTUALLY.
BUT YOU KNOW, LET'S SLOW
DOWN A SECOND, EVERYBODY.
LATINOS, WOMEN, GAYS, WE'RE
NOT QUITE DONE WITH IT YET.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
YOU MEAN BLACK PEOPLE
BECAUSE THE TERM ENDS AFTER
2016 AND --
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT THE FIRST BLACK GUY'S
TURN.
LET'S NOT BE HASTY, JON.
LOOK, WHEN JACKIE ROBINSON
BROKE THE COLOURED BARRIER
IN BUSINESS BALL BLACK
PEOPLE DIDN'T JUST GET ONE
AT-BAT AND WE'RE DONE.
JACKIE PAVED THE WAY FOR
BILLIE-- WILLIE AND HANK AND
SKINNY, JELLY ROLL,
GENTLEMAN DAVE, PLUNK,
CHINO.
>> Jon: REALLY, PLUNK.
>> ACTUAL PLAYER, LOOK HIM
UP, BLACKIPEDIA.
>> Jon: BLACKIPEDIA?
IS THERE A BLACKIPEDIA?
>> THERE IS.
>> Jon: OR THERE WILL BE
NOW.
SO WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAY
NOTHING LATINO PRESIDENT OR
A WOMAN PRESIDENT.
>> NO, NO.
A BLACK LATINO WOULD BE
FINE.
>> Jon: I IMAGINE ALSO A
BLACK WOMAN.
>> YEAH BUT A STRONG BLACK
WOMAN WITH A STRONG BLACK
WOMAN NAME, YOU KNOW, LIKE
KOCHBD LEEZA ON QUVENZHANE,
SOMETHING THAT SAYS YEAH I'M
THE PRESIDENT BUT I COULD
ALSO BE A PERFUME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SO ANY ETHNICITY.
>> AS LONG AS THEY'RE BLACK.
>> Jon: FOR HOW LONG?
LARRY, HOW LONG DOES THE RUN
OF BLACK PRESIDENTS HAVE TO
GO?
I MEAN DO YOU THINK A
DEMOCRACY CAN SURVIVE WITH
THE SAME RACE DOMINATING THE
WHITE HOUSE FOR YEARS ON END
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?
I MEAN IS THAT-- THE-- NOW
THAT I HEAR THAT OUTLOUD I
REALIZE --
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: I SUPPOSE WHITE GUYS
DID HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RUN.
>> GOOD RUN?
JON, YOU HAD 43 OUT OF 44.
>> Jon: WELL, 43 AND A HALF,
REALLY, I MEAN IF YOU ARE'S
ARE'S-- [BLEEP].
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
NICE, JON.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M
SAYING.
>> EVEN BETTER.
JON, YOU GUYS ROCKED IT,
MANMENT AND NOW IT'S OUR
TURN.
LOOK, WE WANT TO RUN WITH
THE SAME DIVERSITY OF BLACK
PRESIDENTS THAT YOU HAD WITH
WHITE PRESIDENTS.
>> Jon: THAT ALMOST MADE
SENSE.
>> JON, OBAMA BLACK, COOL,
INTLRL, WOODROW WILL
INTERNATIONAL BLACK
PRESIDENT.
WE STILL NEED A WAR HERO
BLACK PRESIDENT, AN EX-MOVIE
STAR BLACK PRESIDENT, A
PEANUT FARMER BLACK
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING, CARTER LOOKED
ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE WITH
THE CORN ROWS.
>> JON, THOSE ARE PEANUT
ROWS RZ ARE THEY PEANUT
ROWS.
>> THEY ARE.
>> Stephen: HOW ABOUT A
BLACK SLAFT PRESIDENT.
>> LIKE TAFT, WE HAVE TO
HAVE A BLACK TAFT, A BLAFT.
>> Jon: YEAH!
>> THAT BLAFT WAS A BAD
MOTHA.
>> Jon: SHUT YO MOUTH.
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT BLAFT.
>> Jon: I CAN DIG IT.
>> BLAFT LAM-- .
>> Jon: THE BOTTOM LINE.
>> THAT'S MY LINE, JON.
>> Jon: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> THAT'S OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
OKAY, JON.
WE'RE HAVING FUN.
LET'S GO WITH IT.
>> Jon: I WAS THROWN BACK
INTO RICHARD ROUNDTREE MODE.
>> THREATS LET'S DO BLAFT
AGAIN.
>> BLAFT!
>> IT'S STILL OUR TURN, THE
PRESIDENCY IS LIKE THE RING.
IT'S THE PRECIOUS.
EXCUSE ME, SORRY, IT'S THE
PRECIOUS, BASED ON THE NOVEL
PUSH BY SAPPHIRE, WE'RE NOT
READY TO GIVE UP THAT KIND
OF POWER.
YOU KNOW, COME JUNE 10th
WHEN JOHN OLIVER IS SITTING
IN THAT CHAIR WILL KNOW WHAT
I AM TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: COME ON, HE'S JUST
HERE UNTIL I GET BACK, JUST
A FEW WEEKS IN THE
SUMMERTIME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> INTERNET'S RIGHT.
YOU ARE FUNNY, JON.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, LARRY,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK IS THAT
TRUE?
