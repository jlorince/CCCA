>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.
SO WHAT DID YOU GET YOURSIGNIFICANT OTHER ON VALENTINE'S
DAY?
CAN YOU REMEMBER BACK THEN?
FEBRUARY 14th.
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH.
CHANCES ARE IT'S BETTER THANWHAT RAY RICE GOT HIS FIANCEE.
>> RAY RICE IS CHARGED WITHASSAULT AFTER AN ARGUMENT WITH
HIS FIANCEE IN ATLANTIC CITY.
>> THE ALL-PRO SUPER BOWLWINNING RUNNING BACK HOVERING
OVER AND THEN DRAGGING HISTHEN-GIRLFRIEND, NOW WIFE,
UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF AN ELEVATORAFTER HE PUNCHED HER IN THE
FACE.
>> Jon: I STILL FIND SO ITSTRANGE IN THAT VIDEO.
RICE SEEMS TO BE GESTURING LIKE,HEY, ANYBODY HELP ME?
THIS WOMAN SEEMS TO HAVECOLLAPSED.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE NFL WAS NONETOO HAPPY, AS WAS EXPRESSED ON
NFL'S OWN NETWORK.
>> HE'S ABOUT TO DEAL WITH THEIRON FIST OF THE NFL.
>> Jon: REALLY COULDN'T THINKOF A NON-FIST METAPHOR FOR THIS
CASE?
YOU REALLY, YOU REALLY HAD TO GOWITH IRON FIST?
UNLESS RICE IS GOING TO BEPUNISHED BY CLETUS THE ROBOT,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REPHRASE IT.
BUT LET'S GET TO THE PUNISHMENT.
IS HE EXPELLED FOR ETERNITY ORLONGER?
>> THE NFL HAS OFFICIALLY HANDEDDOWN ITS JUDGMENT ON RICE'S
OFF-SEASON DOMESTIC VIOLENCEINCIDENT.
THE BALTIMORE RAVENS' STAR WASSUSPENDED TWO GAMES BY
COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL.
[AUDIENCE REACTS].
>> Jon: THEY'RE NOT OOHINGBECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S A LOT.
TWO GAMES?
WELL, UNLESS ONE OF THE GAMES ISPROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, WHAT KIND
OF MESSAGE DO YOU THINK THIS ISSENDING?
>> I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEARTO ALL INVOLVED THAT THE NFL
DOES NOT CONDONE DOMESTICVIOLENCE IN ANY WAY AND WILL NOT
TOLERATE IT IN OUR LEAGUE.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TOWHO?
[LAUGHTER]THE LEAGUE SUSPENDS YOU FOR FOUR
GAMES IF YOU GET CAUGHT SMOKINGPOT, WHICH IS ACTUALLY LEGAL IN
ONE OF THE CITIES THE NFLOPERATES IN.
TO BE CLEAR, THE NFL SUSPENDSYOU FOR TWICE AS LONG IF WHAT
YOU HIT IS THIS.
[LAUGHTER]ESPN SUSPENDED THIS GUY FOR A
WEEK JUST FOR TALKING ABOUT ITWRONG.
AND THEN THERE'S THIS:>> ONE ROOKIE GOT A FIVE-GAME
SUSPENSION FOR TAKING FREEBIESIN COLLEGE.
>> Jon: FIVE GAMES FOR TAKINGFREEBIES.
UNLESS FREEBIE IS ANOTHER WORDFOR COLD COCKING YOUR FIANCEE,
THE NFL PENAL CODE MIGHT NEEDSOME TWEAKING.
IN FACT, LET'S BE HONEST, NFL,THIS CASE PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN
BE GETTING THE ATTENTION IT HASIF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON CAMERA.
THE ONLY REASON THE NFL EVENFLAGGED IT IS BECAUSE WE HAD
INSTANT REPLAY IN THIS CASE.
I JUST HOPE RAY RICE UNDERSTANDSTHE SEVERITY OF WHAT HE'S DONE,
EVEN IF THE NFL DOESN'T.
>> I APOLOGIZE TO MY FANS, MY...
TO THE KIDS, TO EVERYONE WHO WASAFFECTED, YOU KNOW, BY THIS
SITUATION THAT ME AND MY WIFEWERE IN.
I WON'T CALL MYSELF A FAILURE.
FAILURE IS NOT GETTING KNOCKEDDOWN, IT'S NOT GETTING UP.
>> Jon: WHAT IS WITH THEVIOLENT METAPHORS?
[LAUGHTER]THE IRON FIST, THE KNOCK DOWN,
THE GETTING UP.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE GRASSIS ALWAYS GREENER.
IT'S NOT APPLICABLE, BUT ATLEAST NOBODY'S GETTING HIT IN
YOUR METAPHOR.
NO SENSE CRYING OVER SPILLEDMILK. OUR LANGUAGE IS RICH IN
NON-VIOLENT IMAGERY.LISTEN, FOR MORE WE TURN TO
SENIOR SPORTS CORRESPONDENTJASON JONES.
JASON, WELCOME.
JASON, THIS IS, THIS IS NOT AHARSH PUNISHMENT.
>> JON, WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECTFROM THIS LEAGUE?
IT IGNORES HEINOUS ACTIONS.
IT COVERS UP THE INJURIES THEGAME INFLICTS ON THE PLAYERS AND
IT REGULARLY SCREWS OVERTAXPAYERS ON STADIUM AND
INFRASTRUCTURE DEALS.
IT IS TIME TO SAY IT: THE NFL ISA MORALLY, INDEFENSIBLE
ORGANIZATION.
OF COURSE, THAT BEING SAID, MANAM I GLAD TRAINING CAMPS ARE
BACK.
I AM READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL!
>> Jon: WHAT?>> A SUNDAY NIGHT PARTY.
WHOO!
>> Jon: JASON, YOU JUST LAIDOUT, IN MY ESTIMATION,
AN ELOQUENT ...
>> UH-HUH.
>> Jon:, AN INCREDIBLE CASEAGAINST THE ETHICS AND THE
MORALITY OF THE NATIONALFOOTBALL LEAGUE.
>> YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING
ME YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TOSTART UP AGAIN.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLEORGANIZATION, BUT I ALREADY
ORDERED THE PARTY SUBS FOROPENNING WEEKEND.
SO INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT, BUTWHAT ARE YOU GOING DO?
>> Jon: YOU COULD FOLLOWTHROUGH, JASON, WITH YOUR
CONVICTIONS HERE, WHICH ARE WELLTAKEN.
>> OH, OH, OKAY, SO, SO NO MOREGIANTS GAMES FOR YOU THEN, JON?
>> Jon: YES, YES.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S ON INTHE BACKGROUND.
[LAUGHTER]OF THE SPORTS BAR THAT I'M IN,
>> RIGHT.>> Jon: I CAN'T ASK
THEM TO TURN iT OFF JUST BECAUSEI'M NOT GOING TO WATCH THE
NEW OFFENSE THE GIANTS HAVEINSTALLED WITH MACADOO AND A
SHORTER PASSING GAME, HIGHERCOMPLETION PERCENTAGES.
COME ON, ELI, YOU CAN DO THIS.
>> YES! EXACTLY!
AND I WILL SEE YOU AT MY HOUSEFOR KICKOFF.
