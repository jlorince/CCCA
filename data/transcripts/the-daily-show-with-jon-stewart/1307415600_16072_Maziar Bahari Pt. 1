(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A
JOURNALIST, A DOCUMENTARY FILM
MAKER AND HUMAN RIGHTS
ACTIVIST.

AS A PRISONER IN AN IRANIAN
JAIL, A FAMILY STORY OF LOVE,
CAPTIVE CAPTIVITY AND
SURVIVAL.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM.
MAZIAR BAHARI.
>> YOU START.
>> Jon: YOU'RE VERY KIND.
ALL RIGHT.
NICELY DONE.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M FINE.
BUT BEFORE WE START I'D LIKE
TO GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST.
YOU KNOW, LAST TIME I CAME
HERE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE
JOKING.
I SAID THAT YOU GOT ME IN
JAIL.
IMMEDIATELY I SAID I'M
KIDDING.
>> Jon: YOU DID SAY THAT.
>> THEN ON BLOGS AND, YOU KNOW,
IN PAPERS I SAW THAT PRISON.
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT
DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MY IMPRISONMENT, MY
ARREST.
THOSE GUYS, I WANTED TO SAY
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> Jon: WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE ON
THIS SHOW, YOUNG MAN.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SHOULD
SAY THAT OR NOT.
>> Jon: THIS IS A VERY CLASSY
OPERATION WE RUN.
>> THOSE GUYS WHO ARRESTED ME,
THEY WANTEDED TO FABRICATE
CHARGES AGAINST ME.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I COULD BE IN SESAME STREET
AND THEY WOULD ACCUSE ELMO OF
SEDITION.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE JUST BROKEN A
STORY, MY FRIEND.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, ELMO?
>> I COULD BE TWO-AND-A-HALF
MEN AND THEY COULD ACCUSE ME
OF COOPERATING WITH WHAT'S HIS
NAME?
CHARLIE SHEEN.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
>> AND CORRUPTING THE EARTH.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.
HE'S REFERRING TO WHEN HE WAS
IN IRAN, WE SENT JASON JONES
THERE.
HE INTERVIEW MAZIAR BAHARI IN
A CAFE AND JASON PRETENDED TO
BE SPY.
WHILE YOU WERE IN PRISON THEY
SHOWED A TAPE OF THAT TO YOU
AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
TO A SPY?
>> BECAUSE JASON LOOKED LIKE A
SPY.
ACTED LIKE A SPY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I GUESS HE TASTED LIKE A
SPY.
TO THEY SAY HE'S A SPY.
>> Jon: THE THING IS THEY
PROBABLY NEVER EXPLAINED IS
WHY WOULD A SPY DO THAT ON
TELEVISION?
>> AND WHY THERE ARE LAUGH
TRACKS.
>> Jon: THE LAUGHTER IS REAL.
