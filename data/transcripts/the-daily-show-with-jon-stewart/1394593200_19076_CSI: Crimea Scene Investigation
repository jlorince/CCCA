SO YOU MAY BE WONDERING, IF WEDON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YE
[LAUGHTER]WHY ARE SUCH SERIOUS PEOPLE IN
AMERICA SO SERIOUSLY SAD ABOUTTHIS DEVELOPMENT
IS IT BECAUSE HOW DEEPLY THISCOUNTRY BELIEVES IN DEMOCRACY
AND FREE PEOPLES? OR MAYBE
>> GROWING CLAIMS THAT BOTHPRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE
UNITED STATES LOOK WEAK ASRUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN
FLEXES HIS MUSCLES IN THEUKRAINE
>> WE HAVE THE CREATED AN IMAGEAROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST FOR
THE RUSSIANS OF WEAKNESS>> PUTIN SOMETIMES MAKES HIS
MOVES WHEN HE PERCEIVESAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO BEWEAK.
>> Jon: WE CARE ABOUT CRIMEAAND THE CRIMEANS
BECAUSE RUSSIA TAKING IT OVERMAKES US LOOK WEAK
AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE AFOREIGN POLICY THAT IS FOCUSED
PRIMARILY ONCOMPARATIVE PENIS SIZE
IF PUTIN IS GONNA WALK IN THEREAND ADD CRIMEA TO THE TIP OF
RUSSIA'S (bleep)
LOOK OUT MOLDOVA WE'RE COMINGFOR YOU.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THESIDE TO SIDE MOVEMENT WAS.
[LAUGHTER]I GUESS THE QUESTION IS
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REST OFUKRAINE?
>> UKRANIAN SOLDIERS AND SAILORSSTILL LOYAL TO KIEV HAVE BEEN
LEFT IN LIMBO. LAST WEEK ONEWARSHIP
CREW HAD EVEN ATTACHEDMATTRESSES TO THEIR VESSEL
TO REPEL RUSSIAN SOLDIERS.
[LAUGHTER[
Jon: I -- UH
I AM NOT A MILITARY GENERAL
[ LAUGHTER] I AM NOT A STRATEGIC DEFENSE
PLANNER, A HISTORIAN OF GREATMILITARY STRATEGIES
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, I DON'TBELIEVE YOU WILL DEFEAT RUSSIA
WITH A NAP BASED DEFENSE SYSTEM.
I TELL YOU WHAT WE COULD USE NOW
SOME GOOD ANALYSIS ABOUT WHATVLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT DO NEXT.
>> IT'S PUTIN'S ACTIONS NOW THATARE REALLY BEING SCRUTINIZED.
BY PEOPLE INCLUDING IMAGE ANDMOVEMENT ANALYST
KAREN BRADLEY.>> HE'S A VERY STRESSED PERSON
IN THIS VIDEO. HIS MOUTH ISWORKING, HE'S LOOKING AWAY FROM
THE COMMANDER. HE'S VERY MUCHINVOLVED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTSAND FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: BODY LANGUAGE? YOU'RETRYING TO FIGURE OUT BODY
LANGUAGE FROM OLD VLADY GODIVAOVER HERE?
BODY LANGUAGE? THAT'S WHAT'SYOU'RE LOOKING FOR?
ALRIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?>> PUTIN'S NOT GIVING
ANYTHING AWAY. NOTHING WILL BEGIVEN.
IT WILL BE HIS TERMS
HE IS DETERMINED TO WIN.
>> Jon: YEAH HE'S PLAYING ITCLOSE TO THE VEST
GUESS WHAT? HE DOESN'T EVEN OWNA (bleep) VEST.
HE JUST WALKS AROUND NAKED HALFTHE TIME
THIS IS WHY NEWS NETWORKS ARETHE WORST.
THANK GOD WE HAVE THE BEST ININTELLIGENCE APPARATUS IN THE
WORLD AND EVEN THOUGH IT'SMOSTLY BEEN TURNED ON US
IT COULD TURN AND USE THEHIGHEST TECH ALGORITHMS,
MASSIVE COMPUTING POWER, THEMOST INTRUSIVE SPY CAPABILITIESTHE WORLD CAN MUSTER
>> PENTAGON OFFICILS TELL USTHEY'VE DONE BODY LANGUAGE
STUDIES ON PUTIN. >> Jon: OH MY GOD.
WHAT'S WITH THE BODY LANGUAGETHING?
[LAUGHTER]I MEAN THAT'D BE GOOD
INFORMATION IF YOU WEREON A DATE WITH HIM.
TRYING TO SEE IF HE'S INTERESTEDIN  YOU OR NOT.
HE KEEPS TOUCHING HIS HAIR, ITHINK THAT MEANS HE WANTS TO
RECONSTITUTE THE SOVIET UNION.
LISTEN WHO AM I TO QUESTION THEMETHODOLOGY
OF THE PENTAGON? THEY CLEARLYKNOW
MORE THAN I. PLEASE SURPRISE US.
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
>> THE PENTAGON WON'T SAY WHATTHEY'VE CONCLUDED ABOUT
PUTIN'S BODY LANGUAGE.[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YEAH YOU WOULDN'T WANTTO GIVE AWAY HIS TELL.
THAT WOULD -- OOH HE TOUCHED HISNOSE, THAT MEANS HE'S GOING INTO
UKRAINE. C'MON THIS GUY ISSHIRTLESS HORSEBACK RIDING,
HE'S RUBBING A TIGER, HE'SKISSING SOME RANDOM KID'S BELLY
HE IS THE BODY LANGUAGEEQUIVALENT OF
TWEETING IN ALL CAPS, AND THEMESSAGE IS
I'M A NUTBIRD.
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S REALLYMOTIVATING PUTIN.
NOT OUR OWN JASON JONES COVERAGEOF HIS TRIP TO RUSSIA LAST MONTH
BUT HE SAT DOWN WITH AN AMATEURDARE DEVIL. HE ASKED
HER WHAT MAKES RUSSIANS TAKESUCH CRAZY RISKS.
>> WE HAVE A FAMOUS SAYING HEREWE LIVE BY: "DON'T BE A PUSSY".
>> Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. VLADIMIRPUTIN'S UKRAINIAN
PUPPET REGIME WAS OVERTHROWN, HELOST CONTROL OF A NEIGHBORING
NATION AND NOW
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE APUSSY
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO INVADECRIMEA,
HE COULD HAVE JUST MADE SOMEVIRAL VIDEOS.
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'SGOING TO BE AS EAGER TO LOOK
DOWN HIS SHIRT FOR FIVE STRAIGHMINUTES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
