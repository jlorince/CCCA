POORLY.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, WHILE WE WERE ALL FOCUSED
ON THE IN FIGHTING AT MSNBC AND
STEPHEN COLBERT I WONDER WHAT IS
GOING ON ON THAT NETWORK THAT
DOESN'T SUSPEND OR FIRE
CANDIDATES THEY HIRE THE
CANDIDATES THUS CUTTING OUT THE
MIDDLE MAN.
WHAT SON THEIR MINDS.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE
PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO INDIA.
>> IT'S GOING COST ABOUT $200
MILLION A DAY FOR THIS ENTOURAGE
TO GO.
>> $200 MILLION A DAY, 3,000
PEOPLE?
>> AS MUCH AS A BILLION DOLLARS
FOR THE TRIP.
>> HALF A BILLION DOLLARS.
>> IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE.
>> IT'S UP TO $2 BILLION FOR TEN
DAYS SOX THAT TRUE?
>> Jon: WHY KNOW.
HOW MANY SHIPS SNL 34 WARSHIPS
POSSIBLY.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
JUST SAYING.
THAT WAS TELEVISION'S GLENN BECK
ACTING, AS ALWAYS, AS FOX NEWS'
FORCE OF REASON.
LET'S CONSULT SOMEONE WHOSE
GRASP OF THESE EVER INCREASING
FIGURES COMES WITH NO
EQUIVOCATION OR UNCERTAINTY.
SOMEONE LIKE RADIO'S GLENN BECK
THREE HOURS EARLIER.
>> HE IS TRAVELING WITH 34 WAR
SHIPS AN ENTOURAGE OF 3,000
PEOPLE, $2 BILLION, 34 WARSHIPS,
$2 BILLION TO GO OVER TO SEE THE
FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS BECAUSE OF
PRESIDENT HE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE
IT.
>> Jon: THANK GOD TV'S GLENN
BECK DOESN'T LISTEN TO RADIO'S
GLENN BECK.
DOES ANYTHING ASK WHERE THE
NUMBERS COME FROM?
>> A PRESIDENT, 40 PLANES, 600
CARS INCLUDING THE BARACK MOW --
MOBILE, THE BEAST, THE ENTIRE
TAJ MAHAL AN ENTOURAGE OF 3,000
PEOPLE, THREE CHOPPERS, A TOTAL
OF COST $200 MILLION A DAY.
>> Jon: TWO THINGS.
ONE THE TAJ MAHAL ISN'T A HOTEL.
[LAUGHTER]
AND TWO:  40 PLANES BUT ONLY 30
DOGS THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE.
WHO IS GOING TO FLY THE OTHER
TEN PLANES?
[IMITATING SCOOBY DOO] I DON'T
KNOW.
IT'S A CONTPAOUGZ STORY.
IF YOU WANT TO DEBUNK THE
FIGURES WOULD YOU HAVE TO CALL
SOMEONE WITH AN NEWS LINE.
>> THIS TRIP DOESN'T COST $200
MILLION A DAY.
>> THAT'S JUST COME CALL.
>> JUST TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE
IT COSTS ABOUT $190 MILLION A
DAY TO EXECUTE THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN.
>> THE $200 MILLION A DAY FIGURE
WHERE DID THAT COMB FROM?
IT WAS A INN A QUOTE BY AN
ALLEGED INDIAN OFFICIAL.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD FOX IS
OUTSOURCING.
WE GO TO AASIF MANDVI LIVE IN
INDIA.
THESE REPORTS THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO INDIA IS
COSTING $200 MILLION A DAY IT
CAN BE TRACED BACK TO AN INDIAN
NEWS STORY CITING AN AMMON US IN
SOURCE.
>> KIT BE CHALKED UP TO A SIMPLE
CULTURAL MISUNDERSTANDING.
>> Jon: WHAT YOU ARE THINKING
IS SOMEONE CONFUSED 200 MILLION
RUPEEES WITH DOLLARS BECAUSE
THAT'S ABOUT 4.5 MILLION.
>> THE ORIGINAL STORY CLEARLY
STATES $200 MILLION THE MISTAKE
WAS FOR WESTERNERS TO SCEP THE
FIRST -- ACCEPT THE FIRST NUMBER
THEY HEARD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I DON'T -- I DON'T
FOLLOW.
>> THIS IS INDIA, JON.
OVER HERE THE REPORTER OPENS
WITH A WILDLY INFLATED NUMBER,
RIGHT?
THEN THE HAGGLING BEGINS.
THE NEWS CONSUMER SAYS $200
MILLION A DAY, DO I LOOK LIKE I
FELL OFF THE MANGO TRUCK.
I'LL GIVE YOU $5 MILLION A DAY.
THE REPORTER SAYS $5 MILLION A
DAY THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, THE HEAD SALAMI.
NO, NO, NO $175 MILLION IS THE
LOWEST THEY'LL GO.
>> Jon: I'M FAMILIAR WITH
HAGGLING AND THE CONCEPT BUT
THESE ARE NEWS FACTS.
I'M SURE THE INDIAN NEWS SERVICE
DOES NOT PUT FACTS UP FOR
BARTER?
>> I'M SEEING THAT YOU ARE A
SHREWD NEWS CONSUMER.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> VERY GOOD AND YOU ARE MY
FRIEND, SIR.
THE TRUTH IS IT'S NOT
INTERNATIONAL STORIES.
DOMESTIC STORIES IS WHAT THEY
DO.
THIS WAS A DOMESTIC STORY WHICH
IS WHY THEY USED HAGGLING.
I GET IT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING FROM A CORRESPONDENT
THAT I DON'T HAVE.
ALL RIGHT.
GO FIND THAT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
I'M GOING TO GO.
I'M WALKING OUT.
THIS IS IT, OKAY.
>> Jon: THANK YOU AASIF.
>> OKAY, FINE, LOOK.
I'M SURE I'M GOING TO GET FIND
FOR THIS.
IT'S LOCAL STORIES.
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?
YOU ARE KILLING ME HERE.
WE ONLY DO IT FOR LOCAL STORIES.
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ISRAELIS, I
