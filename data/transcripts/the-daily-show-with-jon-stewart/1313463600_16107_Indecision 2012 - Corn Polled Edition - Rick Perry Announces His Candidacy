SO THE REPUBLICANS MOVE INTO
THE FALL WITH MICHELE BACHMANN
THE BIG STORY.
WHAT WAS THAT?
THAT LAUGH, SO FAMILIAR, SO
REGIONAL.
I CAN'T PLACE IT.
IT CAN'T BE.
HE'S NOT ELIGIBLE TO RUN
AGAIN.
>> I DECLARE TO YOU TODAY AS A
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> SOMETIMES IT KIND OF TAKES
ME A WHILE TO GET INTO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
PRESIDENTIAL RACE, BUT LET ME
TELL YOU WHEN I'M IN, I'M IN
ALL THE WAY.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD THE JOSH
BROLIN CHARACTER FROM W BE
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
WHAT?
THAT'S A REAL GUY?
NO.
I INTERVIEWED HIM?
OH.
THREE-TERM TEXAS GOVERNOR.
I'M SURE I'M OVERREACTING.
TWO TEXAS GOVERNORS WHO SORT
OF SOUND ALIKE.
HOW SIMILAR COULD THEY BE?
>> THEY'RE TWO GUYS FROM WEST
TEXAS.
SAME TEXAS BOOTS.
SAME KIND OF IDEOLOGIES.
SIMILAR MANNERS AND SOME OF
THAT WEST TEXAS SWAGGER.
>> FORMER AIR FORCE PILOT AND
FATHER OF TWO.
>> MET HIS WIFE IN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.
HE HOLDS A DAY-PRAYER AND
CARRIES A LASER-FIRED PISTOL.
HE IS GEORGE BUSH ON STEROIDS.
>> Jon: NO.
NO, HE'S NOT!
HE'S NOT GEORGE BUSH ON
STEROIDS.
RICK PERRY IS WHAT HAPPENS IF
LEX LUTHOR DISSTILLED GEORGE
BUSH'S ESSENCE IN A LABORATORY
AND CROSSED IT WITH GUN POWDER
AND SEMEN FROM THE FINEST
THOROUGHBRED AND STRAPPEDED
THAT CONCOCTION ON TO A
NUCLEAR MISSILE AND SHOT IT
INTO THE (BEEP) SUN.
AND THEN WAITED, WAITED,
WAITED, UNTIL ONE DAY ON THE
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ALAMO A
SOLAR FLARE YADA YADA YAD RICK
PERRY.
HOW DO I KNOW THAT THIS
CREATURE IS GEORGE BUSH-PLUS-
PLUS?
OH, I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW.
>> HE'S A MAN OF TRUST IN HIS
FAMILY.
HIS FATHER-IN-LAW ACTUALLY DID
HIS VASECTOMY.
(LAUGHING)
>> Jon: MAY I REMIND YOU, HIS
FATHER-IN-LAW IS NOT A DOCTOR.
(LAUGHING)
JUST ONE OF THESE.
HOLD STILL, RICK.
WHICH WANT DO YOU WANT
