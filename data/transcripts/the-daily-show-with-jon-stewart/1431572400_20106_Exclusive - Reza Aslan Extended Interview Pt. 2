( APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  WE'RE BACK NOW, WE'RETALKING TO REZA ASLAN.
THESE CONSTRUCTS THAT WE CREATE,IF YOU REMOVE RELIGION, PEOPLE
FORGET WE CREATED THATCONSTRUCT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WHETHER YOU BELIEVE ITCAME FROM GOD OR NOT, WE'RE THE
ONES WHO CREATED THEINSTITUTIONS AROUND IT.
>> WELL, IN FACT, THAT'S THETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS THAT THESECONFLICTS ARE PRECISELY ABOUT
THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEENINSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS.
>> Jon: HUMAN FAILINGS.>> YEAH!
WHAT DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELYBANANAS IS THIS CONSTANT REFRAIN
YOU HEAR, FROM SOME OF YOURGUESTS, IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT
ISLAM REALLY NEEDS? YOU KNOWWHAT ISLAM REALLY NEES?
IT NEEDS A REFORMATION.
>> Jon:  I KNOW THE GUEST YOU'RETALKING ABOUT!
>> I KNOW YOU KNOW EXACTLY THEGUEST THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: CAN I TELLYOU SOMETHING?
I WAS HERE THAT NIGHT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> YOU WERE THERE, YOU WERETHERE, AND I REMEMBER.
AND MY ANSWER TO THAT IS LIKEOPEN YOUR EYES, MAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON?
DO YOU THINK THAT REFORMATION -->> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I SAID!
( LAUGHTER ).
>> I KNOW.
PEOPLE THINK THAT REFORMATION ISABOUT LIKE HOLDING HANDS AND
SINGING KUMBAYA.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> REFORMATION IS ABOUT ACATACLYSMIC DEBATE OVER WHO HAS
THE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE A FAITH.
IS IT THE INDIVIDUALS OR IS ITTHE INSTITUTION?
THAT DEBATE IN CHRISTIANITY LEDTO THE DEATH OF HALF THE
POPULATION OF GERMANY ALONE.
>> Jon:  YEAH. ALTHOUGH, THEYBOUNCED BACK.
>> THEY BOUNCED BACK,EVENTUALLY.
( LAUGHTER )AND STRONGER THAN EVER.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  AND GOT THEIR POUNDOF FLESH, FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND.
BUT IT'S ALL GOOD NOW.
WE'RE ALL GOOD NOW.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> MY POINT IS IS THAT--( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )MY POINT IS THAT, THAT ARGUMENT
IS PRECISELY WHAT IS AT STAKE INTHE VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE
IN THE  MIDDLE EAST.
>> Jon: BUT THAT GET TO MYPOINT.
IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE IN A CYCLEOF VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
THAT IS AKIN TO THE100 YEARS WAR --
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: BLOODY, LONG TERM,NOT EASILY SOLVABLE.
IT WILL-- IT WILL PITCH BACK ANDFORTH.
SEEING THAT COMING IS AKIN TOWATCHING A TORNADO COMING TO HIT
YOU AND YOU'RE SOMEWHATPOWERLESS--
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  TO STOP IT.
AND WHAT WE SEEM TO HAVE DONE ISOH, THOSE GUYS LOOK LIKE IT'S A
HORNET'S NEST.
WHAT IF WE -- I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU GOT A STICK?
WHY DON'T WE JUST --
>> YEAH.
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE WRONGWAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IT IS TO
JUST SIMPLY DIVORCE RELIGIONFROM IT ALL TOGETHER.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THATSENTIMENT. I UNDERSTAND  --
>> Jon: WELL, IT LENDS POWER TOIT, I THINK.
ANY TIME YOU LEND DOGMA TOSOMETHING YOU LEND POWER.
>> I GET IT. ABSOLUTELY. BUT IDO THINK THAT WE NEED TO RESIST
SAYING, YOU KNOW, ISISHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ISLAM.
OR THAT, YOU KNOW, VIOLENCE INTHE NAME OF RELIGION HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH RELIGION.
WELL OF COURSE, IT HAS TO DOWITH RELIGION.
I MEAN LOOK, IF ISIS CALLSTHEMSELVES MUSLIM, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.FINE, THEY ARE MUSLIM. GREAT.
>> Jon:  IF THAT WAS THEIRORGANIZING PRINCIPLE, BUT I
WOULD SUGGEST WITHOUT THAT, THEYWOULD FIND ANOTHER ORGANIZING
PRINCIPLE, WHETHER IT BE THROUGHA TRIBAL AFFILIATION, WHETHER
IT BE THROUGH A NATION STATE.
WE ARE VERY ADEPT AT FINDINGORGANIZATIONAL CATEGORIES FOR
OURSELVESES TO BELONG TO -->> YEAH.
>> Jon: TO FIGHT A GROUP THATBELONGS TO A DIFFERENT ONE.
>> AND RELIGION IS A VERY GOODCATEGORY.
>> Jon:  IT'S A WONDERFUL--
>> IN FACT, IT HAS THE MOSTCURRENCY FOR THE MASSES.
>> IT'S THE EASIEST WAY --
>> Jon: IT'S THAT AND SPORTSTEAMS, I THINK.
>> WHICH IS JUST A RELIGION.
>> Jon: WHICH IS REALLY INSIMILAR --
YOU WEAR A NICE SHIRT AND YOU GOEVERY SUNDAY.
>> STILL, STILL, MY WHOLE THINGIS I'M OKAY WITH YOU SAYING
THAT ISIS IS MUSLIM.
AS LONG AS YOU ALSO REALIZE THATTHE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
THAT THEY KILL ARE ALSO MUSLIMS,AND THAT THE TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGHTINGAGAINST ISIS IS ALSO MUSLIM.
SO IF ISIS IS MUSLIM, AND THEIRVICTIMS ARE MUSLIM, AND THE
PEOPLE FIGHTING THEM ARE MUSLIM--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: RIGHT, BUT IT'S THATMYOPIA.
>> YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T REALLYSAY ANYTHING ALL THAT
INTERESTING ABOUT ISLAMITSELF, CERTAINLY NOTHING THAT
YOU CAN MAKE AGENERALIZATION ABOUT.
>> Jon:  I THINK WHAT'SHAPPENED IS IN AMERICA WE HAVE
DEFINED OUR LARGEST FEAR ASISLAMIC TERRORISM.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  AND BY DEFINING,THAT BECAUSE OF THE AMERICAN
CHARACTER OF WHATEVER WE'REWORRIED ABOUT IS THE WORRY.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  THAT WE HAVE NOW--AND WE WANT EVERYONE ELSE TO
DEFINE IT IN THAT SAME WAY.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIESMAY DEFINE THE BIGGEST THREAT AS
PREJUDICE AGAINST THEM FORASSUMING THEY MIGHT BE
TERRORISTS.>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: OTHER GROUPS MAYRIGHTLY LOOK AT IT-- I REMEMBER
AFTER 9/11 ASKING GUY WHO WAS--HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE
THE HEAD OF EPIDEMIOLOGY OR THEHEAD OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE.
I SAID, YOU KNOW "WHAT CAN WE DOTO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM
TERRORISM."
AND HE SAID, "WELL, I THINK THETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY DO
IS STOP SMOKING ANDWEAR A SEAT BELT."
AND, BUT IT POINTED OUT THAT YOUGET LOCKED INTO THE IDEA THAT
THIS IS GREATEST THREAT TO US,
WHEN WE ACCEPT GREATERTHREATS EVERY DAY WITHOUT
OVERTURNING THE ENTIRE WORLDORDER.
>> ACTUALLY OTHER ACCORDING TOTHE F.B.I. ARE YOU MORE LIKELY
TO DIE FROM FAULTY FURNITURETHAN FROM TERRORISM.
>> Jon: ARE YOU SAYING--
>> SO LIKE, A LA-Z-BOY IS MOREDANGEROUS THAN ISIS.
>> Jon:  BUT, ARE YOU SAYING MEPERSONALLY.
>> YOU, ACTUALLY, YOU YOURSELF.
>> Jon: BECAUSE I HAVE TERRIBLEPROBLEMS WITH CONVERTIBLE
COUCHES.
>> I WILL SAY THOUGH ON YOURPOINT ABOUT THIS SORT OF
ANTI-MUSLIM FERVOR, I MEAN,THAT'S A VERY REAL THING.
TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS SAY THATISLAMIC AND AMERICAN VALUES
CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER.
HALF OF AMERICANS SAY THATMUSLIMS IN THIS COUNTRY CAN'T BE
LOYAL TO AMERICA.
ONE-THIRD OF AMERICANS-- THAT'S100 MILLION OF US-- BELIEVE THAT
MUSLIMS SHOULD BE FORCED TOCARRY SPECIAL I.D.s
IDENTIFYING THEM AS MUSLIM.
AND THERE'S A HISTORICAL ANALOGYTHERE SOMEWHERE.
>> Jon: I DON'T --
>> I CAN'T-- I CAN'T PUT MYFINGER ON IT.
>> Jon:  I DON'T KNOW WHATYOU'RE DRIVING AT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> YEAH. AND THAT IS THE REALITYOF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TOUNDERSTAND THAT THIS FEAR IS SO
MANUFACTURED BY, YOU KNOW, ANEWS CHANNEL THAT HAS SPUN IT
INTO RATINGS GOLD.
SOME OTHER -- I HAVE -- WE WON'TTALK ABOUT IT.
POLITICIANS WHO USE IT TO GETVOTES --
IT'S ALSO ENORMOUSLY LUCRATIVE--
>> Jon: ON BOTH SIDES, BY THEWAY.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ONEOF THE GREATEST DRIVERS OF
ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT OVERSEASARE THE THE FEAR-BASED RHETORIC
OF LEADERS OF THEIR PUNDITRY -->> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: OF EVERYTHING ELSE -->> FEAR SELLS.
>> Jon: BOTH SIDES HAVE DECIDEDTHAT TO PERPETUATE THEIR OWN
POWER IT MAKES BEST SENSE TOPLAY TO THE BASEST LEVEL OF
FEAR OF YOUR CONSTITUENCY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. HERE'S THE GOODNEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS --
>> Jon:  I WAS WAITINGFOR THIS PART.
>> YEAH. THE GOOD NEWS, FOR THE,FOR LIKE, THE SIX PEOPLE
WATCHING ONLINE, THE GOOD NEWSIS --
>> Jon: DON'T SAY THAT.
THERE'S SIX PEOPLE WATCH ONLINE,BUT THERE'S EIGHT OTHERS WHO
DIDN'T LOG IN WHO ARE ALSOWATCHING.
PROBABLY-- I WOULD SAY 14.
( LAUGHTER )>> THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
EVERYTHING THAT IS SAID ABOUTMUSLIMS TODAY, THAT THEY'RE NOT
AMERICAN, THAT THEY'RE FEARFUL,THAT THEY'RE FOREIGN, THAT THEY
DON'T BELONG HERE, EVERYTHINGTHAT WAS SAID ABOUT AMERICANS
TODAY-- ABOUT MUSLIMS TODAY WASSAID ABOUT JEWS IN THE 40s AND
50s.
WAS SAID ABOUT CATHOLICS AT THEEND OF THE 19th CENTURY.
AND THOSE TWO RELIGIONS, THROUGHTHE PASSAGE OF TIME, THROUGH THE
SLOW BUILDING OF RELATIONSHIPS,THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF
STORY, BECAME VERY MUCH A PARTOF THE RELIGIOUS FABRIC OF THIS
COUNTRY.
THE SAME THING IS GOING TOHAPPEN TO MUSLIMS.
THE BAD NEWS IS THEN WE'LL FINDSOMEBODY ELSE TO HATE.
>> Jon:  WE COULD TOTALLYACCELERATE THAT PROCESS.
>> SHOULD WE? LET'S GO RIGHT NOWTO SOMEONE.
>> Jon:  MAY I?
( BLEEP ) DUTCH.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
RIGHT?
RIGHT?
WITH THEIR-- WITH THEIR WANTINGTO SPLIT THE MONEY ON MEALS.
>> YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )
>> AND THEIR GREAT, GREAT, WEED.WAIT UH --
>> Jon:  WHAT!
>> OH, SORRY.
>> Jon:  YOU ARE A RELIGIOUSSCHOLAR.
ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.
ALWAYS A WONDERFUL DISCUSSION.
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU, AND GOODLUCK.
>> Jon:  THANK YOU VERYMUCH.
THE PAPERBACK OF "ZEALOT" IS ONTHE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
REZA ASLAN!
