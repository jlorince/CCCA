SOME WOULD SAY -- SOME WOULD SAY ISN'T OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE MORE LIKE SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE BECAUSE WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THE MILLIONS OF CITIZENS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE?
WELL, SHUT UP!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE OBAMA'S REAL SOCIALIST SCHEME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE.
>> HE'S BASICALLY SOCIALIZED THE AUTO INDUSTRY.
HE IS MOVING TO FREE MARKET CAPITALISM TO SOCIALISM.
HE SOCIALIZED AUTO CAPS.
>> I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR NEW LINE OF SOCIALIST CARS AMERICA,
THE AMC KREMLIN, THE CLIFTLESS LE BARO, THE CHE-ROLET.
NOW THAT THE TAX PAIR BAILOUT THAT ALLOWED -- ANY SOCIALISTS OUT THERE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO
TAKE THE CREDIT?
>> THAT WAS THE RIGHT COURSE.
I ARGUED FOR IT FROM THE BEGINNING.
FINALLY WHEN THAT WAS DONE AND HELP WAS GIVEN COMPANIES GOT BACK ON THEIR FEET.
I'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT THIS INDUSTRY HAS COME BACK.

>> Jon: HERE IS HOW YOU KNOW -- HERE IS HOW YOU KNOW WHEN A SOCIALIST POLICY HAS WORKED?
WHEN A STAUNCH CAPITALIST TAKES CREDIT FOR IT WITH A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.
NOT EVERY OBAMA SOCIALIST IS WORTHY OF THE ROMNEY NAME.
>> IT'S PART OF TRYING TO REMAKE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN A SOCIALIST MODEL.
YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT GOING IN PICKING WINNERS AND LOSER AND IN THE CASE OF SOLYNDRA PICKED A
CLEAR LOSER.
>> YOU ARE SOCIALIZING THIS COUNTRY.
>> Joe: YOU DON'T PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE GOVERNMENT.
YOU LET THE MARKET DECIDE AND THIS SOLAR PANEL COMPANY, NO -- ANY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY OF
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IS WRONG.
>> THAT'S A SUBSIDY, ALLOW THAT INDUSTRY TO GET UP AND RUNNING

PROFOOTBALL, AMERICA WHAT IS MORE AMERICAN THAN THE NFL.
IT'S A BUSINESS BUILT TO RUN THE RIGHT WAY.
>> THE REAL KEY IS THE UNORTHODOX BUSINESS MODEL.
UNDER LEAGUE RULES THE TEAMS ARE REQUIRED TO SHARE REVENUE WITH EACH OTHER WHICH IS ALWAYS A
STICKING POINT WITH SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISES AND THE MORE POLITCALLY CONSERVATIVE OWNERS.
>> THAT'S SOCIALIST, ISN'T IT?
>> IT'S A FORM OF SOCIALISM AND IT'S WORKED QUITE WELL FOR US.
>> Jon: BURN HIM!
BURN
