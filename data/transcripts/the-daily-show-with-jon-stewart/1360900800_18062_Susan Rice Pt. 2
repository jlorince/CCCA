IT AND THEN IT WILL BE ON THE WEB AFTER THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES INVOLVED.
THEY ARE PAGE A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO IT.
WHEN I WATCHED THE TESTIMONY OF HILLARY CLINTON THEY SAID TO HER, THE AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA
SENT AN E-MAIL SAYING, I NEED MORE SECURITY.
AND SHE SAID, YES, I DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE.
IT STRUCK ME HOW MUCH ATTENTION WAS BEING PAID TO WHAT SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT THIS YET VERY LITTLE
ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THAT E-MAIL.
WHY IS THERE A BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM IN PLACE SO TENACIOUS WITH THE EXPLANATION BUT YET
SEEMINGLY ABDICATES A LITTLE BIT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INITIAL THING.
WOULD YOU SAY IT'S A FAIR COMPARISON?
>> HERE IS WHAT I WOULD SAY, JON.
WE HAVE BRAVE AMERICANS, MEN AND WOMEN SERVING IN OUR DIPLOMATIC POSTS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
MANY OF THEM IN VERY DANGEROUS PLACES.
THEY DO THAT AT GREAT RISK AND GREAT SACRIFICE.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> TRAGICALLY WE HAVE ATTACKS AND WE LOSE AMERICANS.
WE HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW BOARD.
THE INDEPENDENT PANEL THAT IS APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE EXACTLY WHAT WENT WRONG.
WE HAD THAT IN THIS INSTANCE.
FORMER AMBASSADOR AND ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN.
THEY FOUND A LOT OF THINGS HAD GONE WRONG WELL.
RESPECT TO SECURITY PROVISIONS.
WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT, ALL OF THAT THEY MADE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW IT OUGHT TO BE RECTIFIED.
WE OUGHT TO FOCUS ON WHAT WENT WRONG, WHY IT WRONG AND HOW WE GET IT RIGHT.
>> Jon: I GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
DO YOU THINK RATHER THAN THE BUREAUCRACY THIS, GOES THROUGHOUT WASHINGTON IS MORE
TENACIOUS AND DETAIL ORIENTED WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR JOBS AND
SOMETIMES LESS EFFICACIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE MORE BRASS NUTS AND BOLTS THINGS.
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
LOOK, FOLKS WERE DOING THEIR VERY BEST WITH WHAT THEY HAD AND IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
>> Jon: DO YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE CHANGES BEING MADE?
DO YOU FEEL THEY ARE BEING MADE AND IMPLEMENTED.
>> SECRETARY CLINTON AS SHE TESTIFIED IN HER LAST WEEK IN OFFICE HAS BEEN CLEARED THAT THE
STATE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING EVERY ONE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.
THAT NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED UP AND ENSURED IT HAPPENS.
I WORK WITH THESE MEN AND WOMEN EVERY DAY.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THEY ARE COMMITTED, PATRIOTIC AMERICANS.
THEY ARE NOT LAZY.
THEY ARE NOT POLITICAL.
THEY ARE CAREER SERVANTS.
THEY FEEL IT MORE THAN ANYBODY WHEN IT'S THEIR COLLEAGUES WHO GET LOST AND KILLED.
IN THIS INSTANCE AS IN THE PAST WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE MORALE LIKE IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT FEEL THAT LOSS AND FEEL LIKE
THEY DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT JOB?
HOW ARE THEY DOING WITH THAT?
AND IS THERE CONCERN FOR THAT AMONGST THOSE FOLKS?
>> THERE'S A SENSE THAT THIS ISSUE WAS POLITICIZED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE'VE LOST WHAT MATTERS MOST.
HOW DO WE PROTECT OUR PEOPLE GOING FORWARD.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR HIS TOP PRIORITY IS PROTECT AMERICANS WHETHER THEIR DEPP
MATS, SERVING IN THE ARMED FORCES WHEREVER THEY ARE AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON.
>> Jon: IF YOU HAD A THING TO SAY TO THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THERE'S A SECRET UNDER THIS AND
ARE PUSHING FOR IT AND HOLDING THINGS UP WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO
TAKE LIKE A SAILOR, IF YOU WANT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- TALK LIKE A SAILOR, IF YOU WANT.
JUST SAYING FEEL FREE I DON'T MEAN VULGARITY I MEAN ONLY NAUTICAL TERMS.
>> THEY ARE DEAD WRONG.
>> Jon: THEY ARE DEAD WRONG.
>> THEY ARE DEAD WRONG AND DOING A DISSERVICE TO THOSE WE LOST.
