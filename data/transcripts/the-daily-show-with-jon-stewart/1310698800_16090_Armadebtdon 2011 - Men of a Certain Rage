[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT ISN'T
ALONE IN ESCALATING THE RHETORIC
IN THIS FIGHT.
CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN
HAD SOME HARSH WORDS OF HER OWN.
>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT TO
HAVE TO BE CONFRONTED WITH
PRIORITIES IN SPENDING BECAUSE
HE HAS A LOT OF CHOOTS-PAH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I GOT A
FEELING SAYING THE WORD
"CHOOTS-PAH" IS GOING TO HURT
MORE GRANDMOTHERS THAN OBAMA
CUTTING OFF THEIR SOCIAL
SECURITY.
I THINK BOTH PARTIES HAVE
ALREADY LOST FLORIDA.
"CHOOTS-PAH."
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S TALKING OUT OF
HER CHOOTCHAS.
HERE'S SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
MITCH McCONNELL LAYING OUT HIS
PLAN FOR THE DEBT CRISIS.
>> I WOULD ADVOCATE THAT WE
PASSES LEGISLATION GIVING THE
PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO
REQUEST OF US AN INCREASE IN THE
DEBT CEILING THAT WOULD TAKE US
PAST THE END OF HIS TERM.
>> Jon: [WHISPERING]: HEAP
THREAT CAL.
>> THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A
RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL.
THAT RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL
IF PASSED WOULD THEN GO TO THE
PRESIDENT.
HE COULD SIGN IT OR HE COULD
VETO IT.
>> Jon: WAIT.
WHAT?
SEE WHAT McCONNELL DID?
HE CLEVERLY SPLIT THE SENATE'S
RESPONSIBILITY IN TWO,
ADVOCATING THE UNPOPULAR DOING
IT PART TO THE PRESIDENT.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
IF RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT IS THE
RESPONSIBLE CHOICE, WHY ARE YOU
ALLOWING THE PRESIDENT TO DO IT
WHILE WIPING OFF ANY OF YOUR
FINGER AND FOOTPRINTS?
>> THE REASON DEFAULT IS NO
BETTER IDEA TODAY THAN WHEN NEWT
GINGRICH TRIED IT IN 1995 IS IT
DESTROYS YOUR BRAND AND WOULD
GIVE THE PRESIDENT AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BLAME REPUBLICANS
FOR BAD ECONOMY.
LOOK, HE OWNS THE ECONOMY.
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE ALMOST THREE
YEARS NOW, AND WE REFUSE TO LET
HIM ENTICE US IN TO COOWNSHIP OF
A BAD ECONOMY.
>> Jon: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
THE COUNTRY DEFALLING WOULD HURT
THE REPUBLICAN BRAND.
IT'S LIKE WHEN THE PINTO PEOPLE
WERE UPSET THE EXPLODING GAS
CANS WERE SINGEING THE HORSE MA
DANAL.
I FIND McCONNELL'S HONEST
DISHONESTY REFRESHING.
HE'S LAYING OUT THE CYNICAL
STRATEGIC SUBTEXT THAT WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HEARING ABOUT.
HE'S LIKE THAT GUY ON FOX WHO
RUINED MAGIC FOR EVERYONE IN THE
COUNTRY FIVE YEARS AGO.
HERE'S WHAT IT IS, KID.
I DRUG FIVE RABBITS AND I STUFF
THEM IN MY PANTDS.
DON'T CRY, TIMMY.
YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS.
SO THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER, OUR
LEADERS' INABILITY TO COMPROMISE
ON EVEN THE SMALLEST THINGS
SEEMS INEXPLICABLE, BUT WATCH AS
SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL
EXPLAINS WASHINGTON MAGIC TO THE
MUGGLES.
>> YOU SAID, "THE SINGLE MOST
IMPORTANT THING WE WANT TO
ACHIEVE IS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA
TO BE A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT."
>> WELL, THAT IS TRUE.
THAT'S MY SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT
POLITICAL GOAL.
>> Jon: WOW.
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY
THAT ON TELEVISION.
HE HAS GOT A LOT OF, WHAT IS
THAT CALLED, WHAT IS THAT...
