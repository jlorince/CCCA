>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT!
WE GOT A NICE ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NPR'S JUAN
WILLIAMS WILL BE JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
REALLY?
HE'S NOT THERE ANYMORE?
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, I'LL DEFINITELY ASK HIM
ABOUT THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT WE BEGIN, OF COURSE, WITH
OUR ONGOING NATIONAL CRISIS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
ONE WEEK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
FOR OUR TWO PARTIES TO AGREE TO
RAISE THE COUNTRY'S ARBITRARY
DEBT LIMIT FOR THE 102nd
TIME FOR THE DROP-DEAD AUGUST 2
CATASTROPHIC ULTIMATUM WE'VE
ALREADY MOVED TWICE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND SO IT WAS UNDER THESE
CONDITIONS THAT PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA INTERRUPTED A
BACHELORETTE'S SEARCH FOR
LOVE...
(LAUGHTER).
... TO TAKE THAT LONG WALK DOWN
"WE KILLED BIN LADEN" LANE.
>> TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE DEBATE WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN
WASHINGTON OVER THE NATIONAL
DEBT.
>> Jon: THE DEBATE WE'VE BEEN
HAVING?
(LAUGHTER)
IS THAT WHAT THAT NOISE OUT OF
WASHINGTON'S BEEN?
IT SOUNDED LIKE AN A ELEPHANT
SEAL TRYING TO (BLEEP) A TRUCK!
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY, THAT FOOTAGE IS FROM A
FEW YEARS AGO.
THE TWO OF THEM ARE VERY HAPPY
TOGETHER, THOUGH.
(APPLAUSE)
THAT'S AN ABOMINATION.
FUN TO RIDE.
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN FULL
EDUCATOR-IN-CHIEF MODE.
>> FOR THE LAST DECADE, WE'VE
SPENT MORE MONEY THAN WE'VE
TAKEN IN.
IF WE STAY ON THE CURRENT PATH,
OUR GROWING DEBT COULD COST US
JOBS AND DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO
THE ECONOMY.
>> Jon: HUH?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOUR FINANCIAL
AUSTERITY PATH MESSAGE MAY BE
SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT BY THE
GOLDEN-CHAIRED RED CARPET PATH
YOU WALKED DOWN TO TELL US ABOUT
IT.
ISN'T THERE ANY WAY TO DO THE
TIGHTEN THE BELT SPEECH FROM A
ROOM THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE
FOYER OF THE VATICAN?
(LAUGHTER)
JUST SAYING IF WILLY WONKA HAD
TO ADDRESS AMERICA'S CHOCOLATE
SHORTAGE, HE MIGHT NOT DO IT
FROM THE WATERFALL ROOM.
(LAUGHTER)
AUGUSTUS GLOOP!
BUT ENOUGH ON THE THEATRICS,
LET'S GET DOWN TO THE
NITTY-GRITTY.
>> BASICALLY, THE DEBATE HAS
CENTERED AROUND TWO DIFFERENT
APPROACHES.
THE FIRST APPROACH SAYS "LET'S
LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS BY MAKING
SERIOUS, HISTORIC CUTS IN
GOVERNMENT SPENDING.
LET'S CUT DOMESTIC SPENDING TO
THE LOWEST LEVEL IT'S BEEN SINCE
DWIGHT EISENHOWER WAS PRESIDENT
PRESIDENT."
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SO MASSIVE CUTS TO GOVERNMENT
SPENDING.
NO SURPRISE COMING FROM THE
REPUBLICANS.
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS' PLAN.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT THE (BLEEP)'S BEEN GOING ON
DOWN THERE?
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHAT EXACTLY DO THE
REPUBLICANS WANT?
>> REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE
INSISTING ON A DIFFERENT
APPROACH, A "CUTS-ONLY"
APPROACH.
AN APPROACH THAT DOESN'T ASK THE
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS OR BIGGEST
CORPORATIONS TO CONTRIBUTE
ANYTHING AT ALL.
HOW CAN WE ASK A STUDENT TO PAY
MORE FOR COLLEGE BEFORE WE ASK
HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO STOP
PAYING TAXES AT A LOWER RATE
THAN THEIR SECRETARIES.
>> Jon: DEATH TO THE
OLIGARCHS!
DEATH TO THE OLIGARCHS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
POWER TO THE... POWER TO THE
PEOPLE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WOW!
WOW!
COMMUNISM IS HEAVY!
(LAUGHTER)
I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH STRENGTH
IT TOOK TO BE A COMMUNIST.
(LAUGHTER)
AT LONG LAST, MR. PRESIDENT, WE
BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE GROTESQUE
INCOME AND WEALTH DISPARITY THAT
HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO METASTASIZE
TO FEALTY TO CORPORATE
OVERLORDS.
GIVE US OUR ASSIGNMENTS,
COMRADE.
WHAT IS OUR MISSION?
>> SO I'M ASKING YOU ALL TO MAKE
YOUR VOICE HEARD.
IF YOU WANT A BALANCED APPROACH
TO REDUCING THE DEFICIT, LET
YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS KNOW.
IF YOU BELIEVE WE CAN SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM THROUGH COMPROMISE, SEND
THAT MESSAGE.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT'S YOUR IDEA?
CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN?
DID THE PRESIDENT JUST QUIT?
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE THE
PRESIDENT!
YOU'RE ASKING US TO CALL
CONGRESS?
OH, YEAH, SURE, I'LL CALL THE
CONGRESS.
WHY DON'T YOU COME HERE AND MOW
MY (BLEEP)ING LAWN BECAUSE I'VE
GOT (BLEEP) TO DO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GIVEN
UP!
IT FEELS LIKE THAT MOMENT WHEN
YOU WERE A KID AND YOUR FAMILY'S
LATE FOR AN EVENT AND YOUR DAD
WON'T COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM
AND YOU MOM LOOKS AT YOU AND
SAYS "WILL YOU TALK TO HIM?
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU."
HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME, I'M
SEVEN.
AND HE'S AN IDEOLOGUE.
I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR THE
PRESIDENT NOW!
HE INTERRUPTED "THE
BACHELORETTE" TO BE LIKE
(WHISPERING)
"CAN YOU CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN?
I CAN'T TALK TO THEM!"
IT'S LIKE GOING TO THAT
RESTAURANT WHERE THEY'RE LIKE
"YOU GET TO MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA"
AND YOU'RE LIKE, YOU MAKE YOUR
OWN (BLEEP)ING PIZZA.
(LAUGHTER)
HE'S IN A TIGHT SPOT WITH THE
ECONOMY WHICH BECAME VERY
APPARENT BY THE END OF HIS
SPEECH.
>> SO LET'S SEIZE THIS MOMENT TO
SHOW WHY THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA IS STILL THE GREATEST
NATION ON EARTH.
NOT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN STILL
KEEP OUR WORD AND MEET OUR
OBLIGATIONS BUT BECAUSE WE CAN
STILL COME TOGETHER AS ONE
NATION.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.
GOD BLESS TAND M
STATES OF AMERICA.
>> Jon: OH, NOT THE GOLDEN
CHAIRS!
OH, DON'T WORRY, MR. PRESIDENT,
