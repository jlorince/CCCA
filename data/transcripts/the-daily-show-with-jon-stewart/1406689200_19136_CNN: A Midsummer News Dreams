[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO, UH,
LAST WEEK ON THE SHOW, WE WEREDISCUSSING RUPERT MURDOCH'S
INCREASINGLY WORRISOMEADDICTION, ADDICTION, TO
PURCHASING MORE MEDIA COMPANIES.
MOST RECENTLY HIS BID TO BUYTIME WARNER, IT'S SAD TO WATCH
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
AT THIS RATE HE NEEDS MEDIA SOBAD IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL WE
FIND HIM IN AN ALLEY SUCKING[BLEEPED] FOR CRACKED.
THE WEBSITE, THE WEBSITE,HE WANTS TO ADD IT TO HIS MEDIA
EMPIRE.
[LAUGHTER]SO HE'S [BLEEPED] IN AN ALLEY
FOR SOME REASON. I DON'T...
HE'S ACTUALLY RICH ENOUGH, HECOULD PROBABLY BUY THAT, BUT WE
ALSO MENTIONED HOW SINCE MURDOCHALREADY CONTROLS THE FOX NEWS
CHANNEL, WHICH IS SO GOOD, IF HEDID BUY TIME WARNER, HE WOULD
HAVE TO PUT CNN ON THE AUCTIONBLOCK, LEADING US TO ASK FOR
YOUR HELP WITH OUR $10 BILLIONKICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN TO BUY CNN.
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS: BOYTHERE WAS SOME REAL ENTHUSIASM
FOR THIS IDEA.
WE HAVE RAISED, AND THIS IS JUSTRECENTLY AS OF TONIGHT, $4.3
TRILLION.
I ASSUME ALL OF IT LEGITIMATE.
APPARENTLY EVERY ADULT PERSON INAMERICA WANTS TO MAKE THIS
HAPPEN.
SO WE WANT IT TO HAPPEN, ASWELL, BUT LAST WEEK ONE OF OUR
FUTURE EMPLOYEES EXPRESSED SOMEDOUBT.

THAT'S LONGER THAN JAMESFRANCO'S ARM WAS TRAPPED UNDER A
BOLDER.
AND HE ONLY HAD TO DEAL WITHTHAT ONCE.
I'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THISEVERY WEEK AND I'VE ONLY GOT
TWO ARMS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RECONFIDENT WE CAN DO BETTER THAN
WHOEVER IS CURRENTLYRUNNING THAT NETWORK, WHICH
I ASSUME IS JUST A ROOMFULOF ANGRY CHIMPS.

EVEN LOOK THAT ANGRY IN THATPICTURE.
THEY LOOK LIKE JUST SOME BEMUSEDCHIMPS. TRYING TO ORDER PIZZA
OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW, LOOKAT THEM.
LOOK, I KNOW WE'VE GIVEN CNN AHARD TIME IN THE PAST.
WE MAY HAVE LIGHTLY RIBBED THEIRENTHUSIASM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY,
THEIR MAGIC GIANT TOUCH SCREENSAND TALL, GRANDE AND OF COURSE
VENTI, A NEWSROOM FLOOR YOU CANPLAY TETRIS ON HOLOGRAM, A GIANT
[BLEEPED] FOR NO REASON.

WHEN YOU GO BACK IN THEARCHIVES, IT REALLY IS OVERKILL.
[LAUGHTER]LIKE WE REALLY... WHEN YOU WATCH
IT BACK TO BACK TO BACK, YOUREALLY SAY TO YOURSELF, BOY, WE
ARE DICKS. WE ARE.
WE'VE EVEN STUFFED THE CNNSUGGESTION BOX WITH OUR
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OFBRILLIANT REBRANDING IDEAS WE'VE
THROWN THEIR WAY.
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS THEIR NEWSLOGAN: CNN, WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THE [BLEEPED] WE'RE DOING.
IT'S THE SOPHIE'S CHOICE OFNEWS.

FREAKS.
THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE OF NEWS.
WHICH EXPLAINS CNN'S NEW SLOGAN.
>> CNN, WE'RE ALL LIKE, I KNOW.
>> Jon: WE'RE LIKE A GHOSTNETWORK. DOOMED TO ROAM
THE AIRWAVES WITH NO IDEA WHATWE'RE DOING FOR ALL ETERNITY.
THEY'RE NOT EVEN NEWS ANCHORSANYMORE.
YOU'RE JUST NEWS V.J.s.
BASICALLY CNN HAS BECOME THISGUY.
[LAUGHTER]I LOVE BRUNCH. WHO DOESN'T LOVE
BRUNCH?
THAT'S NEWS.
IT'S GREAT BRANDING, WAY BETTERTHAN CNN'S, IF YOU'RE WATCHING
THIS YOUR FLIGHT HAS BEENCANCELED.
PLEASE GOD, SOMEONE HELP ME FINDTHE REMOTE.
THE TV IS STUCK ON CNN AND ICAN'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL.
C'MON MAN, SERIOUSLY, YOU CANTELL ME.

NO ONE'S WATCHING.
>> THIS IS CNN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]SO HERE'S MY POINT, MOVE ON.
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN STUDYINGCNN?
HERE'S HOW LONG:>> I WENT TO THE PARTY.
THEY SAID LIQUOR IN THE FRONT,BLITZER IN THE REAR.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]LOOK WHAT WATCHING CNN FOR 15
YEARS DOES TO A PERSON.
[LAUGHTER]THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING LABEL
ON THAT NETWORK.
