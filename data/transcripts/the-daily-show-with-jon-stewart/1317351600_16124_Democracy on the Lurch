ON THE LURCH.
IT'S THE NEWS EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT.
AMERICA'S GREAT ALLY AND
FAVORITE ROMANTIC STROLL
PARTNER, SAUDI ARABIA, IS
OLDING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONSH
TODAY.
TODAY.
AND THE BIG NEWS FROM THE
ELECTION, NO, NO, NOT THE
SURPRISING STRENGTH OF THE
JEDDAH CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS.

I TRIED TO SAY THAT RIGHT.
IT'S THIS BOMBSHELL
ANNOUNCEMENT.

ARABIA, KING ADBULLAH ANNOUNCED
WOMEN WILL NOW BE ALLOWED TO

SEPTEMBER 29, SAUDI WOMEN,
PARTICIPATING IN MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS FOR THE VERY FIRST
TIME.

COULD PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.

WHAT'S FOUR YEARS WHEN YOU'RE
FINALLY GETTING A CHANCE TO
VOTE.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE
WONDERING IF EXACTLY THAT MEANS
THEY WOULD PRECISELY BE ABLE TO
VOTE.
HE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY THE
WORD "VOTE."
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  STILL, UH,
PARTICIPATION.
WOMEN CAN PARTICIPATE.
THERE ARE STILL GOING TO BE
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAUDI
WOMEN TO HAND OUT FLYERS OR BE
THE VOTING BOOTH.

OF COURSE, IN THE INTERIM, SAUDI
ARABIAIAN WOMEN DO STILL FACE
SOME MINOR RESTRICTION.
>> THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL
ABROAD WITHOUT FIRST GETTING
PERMISSION FROM A MALE GUARDIAN.

WITHOUT A MALE SHAM ROPE.

ACCOMPANIED BY A MALE GUARDIAN.
>> Jon:  MUST GET WEIRD AT
BACHELORETTE PARTIES.
( LAUGHTER )
CHAPERONES ARE PROBABLY SITTING
THERE THE WHOLE TIME LIKE... CAN
WE LEAVE YET?
ALL RIGHT, SO THERE ARE SOME
MINOR, SEEMINGLY ARCHAIC
POLICIES TOWARDS WOMEN IN SAUDI
ARABIA.
LIKE OUR BLUE LAWS.
THEY'RE ON THE BOOKES, SELDOM
ENFORCED, NOD, NOD, WINK, WINK.
>> A SAUDI WOMAN SENTENCED TO 10
LASHES FOR DRIVING A CAR.
>> Jon:  THAT'S (BEEP) UP
( APPLAUSE )
WHY DO WE LET-- WHY DO WE LET
SAUDI ARABIA GET AWAY WITH THIS
STUFF?
HOW CAN WE PUT UP WITH THEM
DENYING WOMEN BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS
AND STILL CALL THEM-- WAIT A
MINUTE-- ALLIES AND ALL THAT.
I JUST-- WHY CAN WE-- HOW CAN WE
DID THAT AND STILL-- I CAN'T
STAY MAD AT YOU.
