THE HEAD OF NCAA MARKEMMERT WOULD LIKE TO REMIND
THESE AT-TIME HUNGRY INDIVIDUALSWHAT THEY ARE REALLY
BEING PAID WITH IS THE MOSTPRECIOUS GIFT OF ALL.
>> THE GAME CHANGER FOR A YOUNGPERSON IN LIFE IS THAT THEY GET
AN EDUCATION.
THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OFWHAT THEY LEARNED AS A STUDENT
ATHLETE AND WHAT THEY GAINED INTHE CLASSROOM.
>> Jon: THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHTAND WHILE MANY BIG-TIME COLLEGE
SPORTS SCHOOLS HAVE MADE AMOCKERY OF ACADEMIC STANDARDS
FOR ATHLETES IN ORDER TOCONTINUE TO COMPETE AT THE
HIGHEST LEVELS CREATING NO SHOWCLASSES, PREDETERMINED MAJORS
AND GRADES TO MAINTAIN THEILLUSION OF ACADEMIC COMPLIANCE.
POINT TAKEN. STUDENT -- STUDENTSTILL COMES BEFORE ATHLETE.
>> PLAYERS SPEND 50-60 HOURSA WEEK ENGAGING IN FOOTBALL
RELATED ACTIVITIES.
>> Jon: ALL THAT MEANS IS THATSOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO
MANAGE YOUR TIME MORE CAREFULLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE IF THESE ATHLETES WHO HAVEJUST DIRECTLY POURED MILLIONS
INTO THE COFFERS OF THEUNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT ARE
HUNGRY, THEY COULD TAKEADVANTAGE OF THE LOCAL
BUSINESSES WHO ARE GIVING AWAYEVERYTHING FROM DRINKS TO FROYO
TO THE CRAZIEST OFBREADS TO REWARD UCONN'S
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. IF OFCOURSE THAT WAS IN ANY WAY LEGAL
UNDER NCAA RULES GOVERNING THEACCEPTANCE BY ATHLETES OF
ANYTHING OF MONETARYOR CALORIC VALUE.
>> OKLAHOMA SELFREPORTING THREE STUDENTS
RECEIVED FOOD IN EXCESS OF NCAAREGULATIONS AT
A GRADUATION BANQUET. THEYWERE PROVIDED PASTA IN
EXCESS OF THEPERMISSIBLE AMOUNT.
>> Jon: IF I MAY HERE IS ADRAMATIC REENACTMENT OF THE NCAA
ENFORCING THAT REGULATION.
HEY, HEY, (bleep).
YEAH, HALF A CUP OF PENNE,(bleep), HALF A CUP.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU CAN DUNKWITH BOTH HANDS, HALF A CUP OF
PENNE.
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS WRONG WITHPLAYERS BANDING TOGETHER TO
NEGOTIATE THEMSELVES A FAIRSITUATION?
ONCE AGAIN THE PRESIDENT OF THENCAA?
>> TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK THENOTION OF USING A UNION EMPLOYEE
MODEL TO SOMETHING THAT STRIKESMOST PEOPLE AS A GROSSLY
INAPPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THEPROBLEMS.
IT WOULD BLOW UP EVERYTHINGABOUT THE COLLEGIATE MODEL OF
ATHLETICS.
>> Jon: AND WE LIKE OUREXPLOITATIVE, OVERWHELMINGLY
FINANCIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO USDRACONIAN COLLEGIATE MODEL.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THE OLDEXPRESSION, IF THEY ARE BROKE,
WHY FIX IT? SO, THAT'S HOW THE NCAA FEELS.
BUT THAT'S JUST AN ORGANIZATION.
I'M SURE THE COACHES, THE GUYSWHO SPEND EVERY DAY WITH THESE
KIDS.
I BET THE COACHES ARE ON THEIRSIDE.
>> I'M A FOOTBALL COACH, I'M ATEACHER, I'M AN EDUCATOR. THIS
ISN'T WHAT I SIGNED UP TO BE. ISIGNED UP TO HELP THESE GUYS
TO DEVELOP TO BE THE BEST THEYCAN BE NOT TO BE AN EMPLOYER.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT TO GETTECHNICAL OF COURSE YOU ARE NOT
THE EMPLOYER, YOU'RE KIND OFTHE SUPERVISOR, THE FLOOR
MANAGER. THE FLOOR BEING100 YARDS LONG AND YOU
CAN AT YOUR WHIM GET THEM TO RUNBACK AND FORTH ON
UNTIL THEY VOMIT ORMORE SPECIFICALLY DRY HEAVE
SEEING AS THERE'S NOT A LOT OFFOOD IN THE BELLY. BUT LISTEN,
YOU ARE AN EDUCATOR, YOU'RERIGHT. BUT WITH ONE SMALL
SOMEWHAT CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE.
>> HEAD COACHES AT 44 SCHOOLS INTHE NCAA'S FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP
BOWL GAMES MAKE AN AVERAGE OF $2MILLION IN SALARIES AND IN 40 OF
THE 50 STATES PUBLIC UNIVERSITYHEAD FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL
COACHES ARE THE HIGHEST PAIDPUBLIC EMPLOYEES.
>> Jon: EXCUSE ME THEY PREFERTHE TERM EDUCATOR.
BUT ALL RIGHT, SO AS WE DO ATTHE END OF EVERY MARCH MADNESS A
SALUTE TO THE HEROES, TO THEEDUCATORS OF THESE FINE STUDENT
ATHLETES.
♪ ONE SHININGMOMENT YOU REACH FOR THE SKY ♪
♪ ONE SHINING MOMENT, YOU KNEW,ONE SHINING MOMENT YOU WERE
WILLING TO TRY ♪♪ ONE SHINING MOMENT YOU KNEW.
>> Jon: YEAH, IT GETS ME EVERYTIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
