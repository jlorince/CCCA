>> Jon: WELCOME BACK! MYGUEST TONIGHT,
HE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THECIA FROM 2009 TO 2011, AND
THEN BECAME SECRETARY OF DEFENSE UNTIL 2013.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WORTHY FIGHTS."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,SECRETARY LEON  PANETTA.
SIR. HELLO!
HOW ARE YOU SIR?
>> THANKS.>> Jon: PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
[APPLAUSE]NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU'VE WRITTEN A BOOK HERE,IT'S CALLED "WORTHY FIGHTS."
WE'LL TALK ABOUT YOU.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK.
YOU WERE WITH THE CIA, SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU ALREADY KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.
WHY?
SO, SO, WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOKLIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU WANT
TO PROMOTE IT, DOES THEPRESIDENT CALL YOU AND SAY,
"SHUT UP." OR DOES HE -- WHATHAPPENS?
WHAT IS THE PUSH BACK?
>> NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH.
>> Jon: REALLY? THERE HAS NOTBEEN,
THEY HAVEN'T CALLED TO COMPLAIN AND SAY YOU'RE
SPEAKING ILL OF OUR  STRATEGIESAND THAT SORT OF THING?
>> NO. NO.
>> Jon: REALLY?>> NO.
>> Jon: IS THAT WHY, SO WERE YOUWORRIED WHEN YOU WROTE --
>> I MEAN, AFTERALL, I WAS THECIA DIRECTOR.
>> Jon: SO THEY'RE AFRAID OF YOU?
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHAT ARE WE DOING? [ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE ARELATIVELY INCOHERENT STRATEGY,
AND WE'VE HAD IT FOR QUITE SOMETIME NOW.
AND TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE STRATEGIES LIKE THAT YOU
CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT COHERENT.
SO WE HAVE THISIDEA. WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT ISIL.
IT'S THIS INCREDIBLY EVIL GROUP.MORE EVIL THAN ANYTHING WE'VE
EVER SEEN, AND WE'REINCREDIBLY SCARED OF THEM.
BUT WE'RE ONLY GOING TO FIGHT THEM FROM THE AIR, AND ONLY IN
CERTAIN PLACES AT CERTAIN TIMES.
DOES THAT SOUND COHERENT?
>> WELL -->> Jon: YES?
>> I GUESS IT WILL DEPEND ONWHAT HAPPENS WITH KOBANI.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, WHEN YOU'REDEALING WITH SOMETHING LIKE
THIS...>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND A TERRORISM THREAT LIKETHIS THAT FRANKLY, YOU KNOW,
MOVED AS QUICKLY AS IT DID, ITHINK WHAT HAPPENS IN
WASHINGTON IS, YOUKNOW, HOW DO WE MOVE ON THIS?
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS?
HOW DO WE CONFRONT IT?
AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEPRESIDENT DECIDED IS WE'RE
GOING TO CONFRONT ISIS, WE'REGOING TO PUT TROOPS ON THE
GROUND IN IRAQ TO TRY TO TRAINTHE IRAQI SECURITY FORCE
TO DEAL WITH --
>> Jon: THEY'RE NOT TROOPS ONTHE GROUND, THOUGH.
HE'S CALLING -- WE'RE CALLINGTHEM ADVISERS.
>> YEAH, BUT THEY WEAR BOOTS.
[ LAUGHTER ][ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: ALRIGHT, SO WE HAVETROOPS IN IRAQ NOW. CRAZY.
SO WE HAVE TROOPS ON THEGROUND IN IRAQ.
BUT APPARENTLY SYRIA WHICH IS GENERALLY THEIR SAFE HAVEN IS
A TOTALLY SEPARATE ENTITY.
>> IT IS. SYRIA ISCHAOS RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NOBODY QUITE KNOWS, YOUKNOW, WHO'S IN THE OPPOSITION,
HOW MANY MEMBERS OF THEOPPOSITION THERE ARE,
HOW MANY GROUPS THERE ARE.
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW ISIS PRETTYMUCH DEVELOPED.
AND SO THAT STRATEGY IS, YOUKNOW,  WE HAVE DECIDED -- THE
PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO IN AND TRAIN
AND TRY TO ARM THOSE ELEMENTS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL REPRESENT
A MORE MODERATE OPPOSITION FORCE THAT CAN THEN HELP US IN
DEFINING THE TARGETS THERE AND GOING AFTER ISIS IN SYRIA.
IT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH TOUGHER CHALLENGE.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: SO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKEOF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
RHETORIC THAT WE HEAR AND THE REALITY?
BECAUSE THE RHETORIC IS, WE'RE IN THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES.
THIS IS AN EXTENTIAL THREAT,THAT WE MUST CONFRONT.
>> YEAH. >> Jon: BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO,
YOU KNOW, INVOLVE THE WHOLECOUNTRY.
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE GO AHEAD TO DO WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO WITHOUT MAKING THE COMMITMENT AND GETTING THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY INVOLVED IN WHATEVER THIS BATTLE IS.
>> YEAH, NO. JON, I THINK WHENWE CONFRONT THIS KIND OF THREAT,
AND BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE LONG AND SUSTAINED, THIS IS
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN -- YOUKNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO WIN THIS OVERNIGHT.
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> I THINK WE --
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS TO PREPARE THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG
AND SUSTAINED BATTLE AGAINST ISIS, AND I THINK THE BEST WAY
TO DO IT, FRANKLY, WOULD BE TO HAVE CONGRESS, REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS COME TOGETHER TO GIVE HIM THE AUTHORIZATION.
>> Jon: WHO DID, NOW WHAT WASTHAT NAME  AGAIN?
CONG - GESS?CONG - GESS?
>> THOSE GUYS THAT ARE UP ON THE HILL THAT CAN'T DECIDE
WHAT TO DO.
>> Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT YOU HEARFROM THESE GUYS.
WE'RE IN THIS EXISTENTIAL FIGHTFOR OUR  LIVES.
THEY WON'T COME BACK FROM A RECESS TO DEBATE THIS ON THE
FLOOR.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: HOW IN GOD'S NAME CANTHAT BE  OKAY?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY ISGOING THROUGH THIS DANCE AS TO
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD DO IT.
YOU KNOW, WE'D LIKE TO DO IT.
WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE WOULD WELCOME ITHAPPENING.
I THINK FRANKLY, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SAY TO THE CONGRESS,
COME BACK, LET'S MAKE A DECISION HERE WITH REGARDS TO
THE AUTHORIZATION TO TAKE THISON.
BECAUSE THIS IS WAR. THIS ISWAR.
>> Jon: BUT WAR POWERS ISCONGRESS' ACT.
THEY'RE NOT BABIES.
THEY CAN CALL THEMSELVES BACK.>> THEY CAN DO THAT TOO.
>> Jon: THEY DON'T HAVE TO BEINVITED TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING
TO DO THIS.
>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS CONGRESS HAS A HARD TIME
TRYING TO FIND THE BATHROOMS INTHE CAPITOL.
[ LAUGHTER ][ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: AND IT BRINGS UP TO THISOTHER IDEA.
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEENFLOATED THAT IF ONLY WE
HAD KEPT 5,000 TROOPSIN IRAQ AND TRAINED
SOME SYRIAN REBELS, NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING?
AND TO MY MIND, THAT SEEMS UNBELIEVABLY UNREALISTIC.
WE WERE IN IRAQ FOR 10 YEARS, WESPENT A TRILLION DOLLARS,
WE LOST MANY LIVES, WE TRAINEDTHIS WHOLE ARMY,
THE IDEA THAT THIS ONE SMALL SOLUTION WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY
AVOIDED THIS CRISIS SEEMSINCREDIBLY REDUCTIVE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YET YOU HAVE SENATORSOUT THERE CHAMPIONING IT AS
THOUGH IT'S DOGMA.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, NO ONEREALLY KNOWS WHAT THE ULTIMATE
RESULT OF THAT WOULDBE. I MEAN, I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE
THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVEMAINTAINED A PRESENCE THERE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE FRANKLY, WEDIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THE IRAQIS
SECURITY FORCE AND INTELLIGENCE FORCES WOULD, IN FACT,
CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO HELP PROTECT THEIR
COUNTRY, AND I THINK ITWOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
TO HAVE BEEN THERE...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON.
>> Jon: BUT THEY WOULDN'T,APPRENTLY THEY WOULDN'T
GIVE OUR TROOPS IMMUNITY, NO?>> NO.
>> Jon: OR THEY, THEY WOULDN'TGIVE THEM PERMISSION.
>> PRIME MINISTER MALIKI SAID WE NEED A SOFA AGREEMENT
WHICH IS A STATUS OF FORCESAGREEMENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. SURE.
>> TO PROTECT THE TROOPS, AND MALIKI CONTINUED TO RESIST IT,
SAID, YOU KNOW, YEAH, WE SHOULDHAVE YOU DO THIS, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SURE ABOUTTHE SOFA AGREEMENT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEND IT TOTHE PARLIAMENT, AND IT WAS
OBVIOUS THAT HECONTINUEED TO OPPOSE IT.
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, ITHINK PROBABLY WE COULD HAVE --
WITH THE LEVERAGE WE HAD ON HIM,WITH MILITARY ASSISTANCE,
WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE PUSHEDHIM A LITTLE MORE IN THE
DIRECTION OF PROVIDING THAT KINDOF --
>> Jon: BUT DID HE HAVE THE LEVERAGE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY,
IN HIS OWN PARLIAMENT? CLEARLYTHE, HIS COALITION WITH THE
SADRISTS WAS VERY WEAK TO BEGINWITH. THE SUNNIS DIDN'T CARE
FOR HIM IN ANY STRETCH OF THEIMAGINATION.
>> HE WAS PLAYING THE SHIAGAME WHICH IS BASICALLY,
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO CONFRONTTHE SUNNIS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I WOULD RATHER DO IT WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES PRESENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT, THE SHIITE,SHIA GAME, ONE OF THE WORST
CHILDREN GAMES EVER MADE. IDON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
[ LAUGHTER ]WILL YOU STICK AROUND?
I KNOW YOU HAVE A BOOK PARTY TO GO TO, BUT WE HAVE A FEW
MORE MINUTES.>> ABSOLUTELY.
STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF.
"WORTHY FIGHTS" IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
LEON PANETTA.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ APPLAUSE ]
