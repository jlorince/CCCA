[ LAUGHTER ]NOW, OBVIOUSLY THE FAILURE OF
THIS BILL TO HELP OUR VETERANSDID GET SOME ATTENTION AND SOME
SHAMING.
YOUR HAYES, YOUR CUOMO MADE APOINT OF DISCUSSING THIS
TRAVESTY BUT THE OUTCRYDISPARITY BETWEEN THE TRAVOLTA
NAME FLUB SHAMING AND THERELATIVE LACK OF SHAMING AIMED
AT REPUBLICAN SENATORS (bleep)OVER VETERANS SHOWS I THINK A
REAL PROBLEM WITH OUR NATION'SSHAME-O-METER.
THERE'S THE PROBLEM THERE.
IT'S OUT OF WHACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]YOU HAVE YOUR DIC PIC.
HERE IS THE PROBLEM.
YOU HAVE YOUR PICK PIC TWEETSWHERE SHAFTING VETERANS SHOULD
BE.
YOU HAVE TO FLIP THOSE.
ALL THE ELEMENTS FOR A GOODSHAMING ARE IN PLACE WITH THIS
VETERANS BILL.
HYPOCRITICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINSTIT.
>> THEY SAID $24 BILLION PRICETAG WOULD BUST THE BUDGET.
>> IT'S NOT PAID FOR IN ANY WAYIT'S ALL BORROWED MONEY.
>> IF THE V.A. IS FAILING TOMEET ITS OBLIGATIONS TO VETERANS
IS IT WISE TO EXTEND ITS MISSIONFURTHER?
OF COURSE NOT.
>> Jon: THE V.A. IS WASTEFULOFTEN INEFFECTIVE.
THIS IS TRUE.
ADDS TO THE DEBT FOR THIS BILL.
APPARENTLY THOSE ARE THINGS THATTHESE SENATORS DIDN'T WORRYABOUT IN
2008 WHEN THEY VOTED TO CONTINUEFUNDING THE IRAQ WAR DESPITE THE
PENTAGON BEING UNABLE TO ACCOUNTFOR A MISSING  $15 BILLION WORTHOF
(bleep) WE BOUGHT.
BUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT. WHEN YOUSPEND MONEY AND YOU'RE
AWAY FROM HOME YOUARE ALLOWED TO SPLURGE.
YOU ARE ON A WAR-CATION.
[ LAUGHTER ]WE'VE GOT VETERANS CONDEMNING
THIS VOTE.
>> THE AMERICAN LEGION SAYINGTHERE WAS A RIGHT WAY TO VOTE
AND A WRONG WAY TO VOTE TODAY.
41 SENATOR CHOSE THE WRONG WAYTODAY.
INEXCUSABLE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE WHOVOTED NO TODAY COULD LOOK A
VETERAN IN THE EYE ANDJUSTIFY THAT VOTE.
>> Jon: THE TRICK IS THEYDON'T LOOK THEM IN THE EYE.
THEY LOOK RIGHT HERE.
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO (bleep)PEOPLE OVER WHEN YOU JUST LOOK
AT THE FOREHEAD.WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO SHAME THESE
SENATORS? CAN I GETA NUN OUT HERE?
LET'S GET A NUN OUT HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HERE WE GO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]GIVE THEM -- RIGHT THERE.
THERE YOU GO.
IS THAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKEIS THAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
FOR YOU TO ACT RESPONSIBLY?
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT CANSAVE THIS SENATORS?
>> I HAVE IN MY BILL A PIECE OFLEGISLATION THAT'S COSPONSOREDBY 59
SENATORS, BIPARTISAN.
>> Jon: NOW YOU ARE TALKING,SISTER, YOU CAN GO.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING 59 SENATORSBIPARTISAN YOU ATTACHED ANAMENDMENT TO THE
VETERANS BILL THAT WOULD FIX ANYISSUE THAT YOU HAD WITH IT AND
YOU HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FORIT.
WHAT IS IT?
>> THE IRAN SANCTIONS BILL.
>> Jon: MOTHER (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]IRAN SANCTIONS.
YOU ARE PUTTING IN IRANSANCTIONS AMENDMENT ON THE
VETERANS BENEFITS (bleep)SISTER, COME BACK IN HERE.
COME BACK HERE IN.
COME BACK HERE IN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> WELL, YOU'VE DONE IT NOW WHO
WANTS TO TASTE SOME OF THESENUN-CHUCKS.
>> Jon: IT'S INTERESTING INJAPAN IT'S REFERRED TO AS
NUNCAHKU.
OK NUN CHUCKS IT IS.
LET'S GO OVER HERE.
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY ATTACHING THEIRAN SANCTIONS BILL TO THE
VETERANS BENEFITS BILL?
>> IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GETTHIS TO THE FLOOR.
BECAUSE WE'RE DENIED ANY OTHERATTEMPT TO DO IT.
>>[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: BOO BOO BOO YOU ARERIGHT.
YOU ARE THE VICTIM HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN DENIED SOMETHING YOUNEED BY AN IMPERSONAL GOVERNMENT
BUREAUCRACY, HOW CAN ANYONE KNOWTHE ANGUISH THAT YOU MUST FEEL?
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORSTEXPLANATION OF WHY THE IRAN
SANCTIONS BILL IS A RELEVANTADD ON TO THE VETERANS BILL THISWAS THE WORST.
>> IF THE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL AS ITRAGICALLY HAVE TO TELL YOU THEY
ARE DESTINED TO FAIL AND IRANRETAINS THE ENRICHMENT
CAPABILITY, I WOULD ARGUE TO YOUTHAT IT ACTUALLY IS RELEVANT
BECAUSE IT'S OUR MEN AND WOMENIN UNIFORM THAT WE'RE GOING TO
TURN TO WHEN THIS THING ENDS UPTHE WAY I KNOW IT WILL AND ASK
THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THISPROBLEM.
>> Jon: YOU GET IT?
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PROPERLY TAKECARE OF OUR EXISTING VETERANS
WHEN WE KNOW HOW MANY MOREVETERANS WE'RE ABOUT TO CREATE
WITH OUR INEVITABLE WAR WITHIRAN.
IT'S BAD ECONOMICS. THAT'S GOTTABE THE HIGHEST RATING ON THESHAME-O-METER
>> KANSAS SENTAOR JERRY MORANHAS BLOCKED A LONG
DELAYED FLOOR DEBATE ON THESEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY
ISSUE INSISTING IT BE LINKED TOSANCTIONS IN IRAN.
>> Jon: I STAND CORRECTEDAPPARENTLY THE SHAME-O-METER
GOES TO 11.
WHY DO THESE SENATORS GET TOSTAY IN OFFICE?
MAYBE IF WE FRAME THEIR ACTIONSIN WAYS THAT WE KNOW GENERATE
REAL OUTRAGE IN AMERICA, BYPRIORITIZING SANCTIONS IN IRAN
OVER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OFOUR EXISTING
VETERANS I THINK THESENATORS MAY HAVE
JUST TWEETED OUT A PICTUREOF THEIR ENORMOUS BALLS.
[ LAUGHTER ]NOW CAN WE --
[LAUGHTER][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW CAN WE KICK THEM OUT? WE'LLBE RIGHT BACK.
