EVEN IN YOUR OWN HOME.

THE WEIGHT ABOVE THIS ROOMALONE, THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE
FULL-SIZED GRAND PIANOS.
THAT'S ENOUGH WEIGHT TO HAVE THEROOF CAVE IN.
YOU GET TWO FEET OF SNOW UPTHERE, AND IT'S THE EQUIVALENT
OF NINE HEAVY-DUTY PICKUP TRUCKSON TOP OF THE ROOF.
AND WHEN THAT AMOUNT OF SNOWSTARTS TO SLIDE, IT CAN EASILY
DAMAGE OR DESTROY ANYTHING INITS PATH.

THE ROOF!
WHEN DID THE WEATHER CHANNEL GETMICHAEL BAY TO DIRECT ITS
VIDEOS?
SURE, I'M BEST KNOWN FOR MYFILMS ON THE DANGERS OF FIGHTING
SPACE ROBOTS, BUT MY REALPASSION IS SEASONAL
PRECIPITATION SAFETY.
(  LAUGHTER  )CLEARLY, THE STORM OF THE
CENTURY WAS ON OUR HANDS WITHENOUGH SNOW TO CRUSH US IN OUR
BED!
AND, SURE, WHILE A LOT OF NEWENGLAND DID GET HORRIBLY HIT,
NEW YORK CITY-- THE PLACE WHEREALL THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS
LIVE-- DID NOT GET HIT THATHARD.
( LAUGHTER )LEAVING THE NETWORKS WITH SOME
TOUGH CHOICES.
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CONDITIONS HAVECHANGED, EASE UP ON THE
BREATHLESS HYPE, FOCUS YOURATTENTION ON NEW ENGLAND, WHERE
IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SNOWING,OR DESPERATELY CLING TO THE
ORIGINAL NARRATIVE.

"MOBILE."
IT'S ONE THING FOR THE REPORTERSTO STAND OUTSIDE LIKE AN IDIOT
