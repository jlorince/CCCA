(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
NOW, AMERICA AND IRAN ARE STILLNEGOTIATING OVER IRAN'S
NUCLEAR PROGRAM. IT'S A FRAGILEPROCESS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENTROUHANI MUST OVERCOME THEIR
MUTUAL DISTRUST AND THE DISTRUSTOF THEIR OWN COUNTRY'S HARD
LINERS. NOW --
(LAUGHTER)THAT -- I'M SORRY.
THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT. THAT'S-- I'M --
YES, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT.
NOW, THESE NEGOTIATIONS -- YOUNEVER WANT TO LOSE YOUR POWER
BEARD.
THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE DELICATEBUT ELIMINATING THE THREAT OF
NUCLEAR IRAN WHILE BRINGINGIT INTO THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS
WOULD BE AN ENORMOUSDIPLOMATIC ACHIEVEMENT,
JUST THE SORT OF THING TORETROACTIVELY JUSTIFY
A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
AND FOR THE FIRSTTIME, A DEAL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
AS LONG AS NO ONE MAKES ANYWEIRD MOVES.
>> HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNBOEHNER INVITED ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMINNETANYAHU TO ADDRESS
CONGRESS ON IRAN ANDNETANYAHU ACCEPTED.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IS FURIOUSWITH THE ISRAELI LEADER FOR
ACCEPTING HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNBOEHNER'S INVITATION.
>> Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT HOW PETTY THIS WHOLE THINGIS, BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT IT, MEANS WE'RE GONNAHAVE TO TALK ABOUT ISRAEL,
AND WHENEVER WE DO WE GETTHE PHONE CALLS.
SO, LET ME JUST -- YOU KNOW WHAT-- LET ME JUST BRING THIS OUT.
(RINGING)HERE LET ME -- ALL RIGHT. THIS
IS THE -- IT'S ALREADY STARTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'VE GOT ASOLUTION.
LET ME JUST, LET ME JUST TURN ITOFF.
IT HAPPENS TO HAVE A BUTTON ONIT, AN OFF BUTTON.
LET ME JUST -- ALL RIGHT --THERE -- OKAY GOOD.
I'M JUST GONNA TURN IT OFF
AND NOW LET'S, WE CAN TALK ABOUTTHIS SITUATION.
WHERE WAS I?
NETANYAHU AND BOEHNER ARE ITHINK GOING TO UNDERMINE
WHATEVER PROGRESS IN FOREIGNPOLICY THAT --
(RINGING)OH FOR GOD'S SAKE.
I TURNED THIS OFF!
I -- OKAY.
I'M JUST GOING TO UNPLUG IT.
I'M SORRY.
SO ONE OF OUR CLOSEST FOREIGNALLIES IS TAKING SIDES WITH
REPUBLICANS AGAINST THEDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT,
WHICH CREATES A MAJOR CONUNDRUMFOR DEMOCRATS.
>> DOZENS OF HOUSE DEMOCRATSHAVE PRIVATELY TALKED ABOUT
SKIPPING THE MARCH 1ST ADDRESSBY BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ISAMONG THOSE WHO HAS
REPORTEDLY SAID THAT HE WILL NOTCOMMIT TO ATTENDING
THE PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.
>> DEMOCRATS COULD BE CAUGHT INTHE MIDDLE, SUPPORT THE
PRESIDENT OR SUPPORT A U.S.ALLY?
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, GREAT BEATUNDER THAT CLIP.
BOY, THAT TRULY IS A PUZZLE OFBIBLICAL PROPORTIONS.
SHOULD WE ATTEND OR SHOULD WENOT ATTEND.
I'M REMINDED OF A SIMILARSITUATION FACED BY AN ISRAELI
KING RENOWNED FOR HIS WISDOM.
WHEN FACED WITH THE SEEMINGLYIMPOSSIBLE PROBLEM OF ONE BABY
CLAIMED BY TWO MOTHERS HEPROPOSED A SIMPLE SOLUTION, CUT
THE BABY IN HALF, AND SO THEYDID.
THE WOMEN EACH TOOK THEIR HALFBABY HOME.
NOW THE HALF BABIES BOTH GREW UPTO BE FINE YOUNG MEN, ONE
WAS NAMED SCHMOOL AND BECAME ARENOWNED HAT MAKER, THE OTHER
MOISHE OPENED A KICKING FACTORY.
(LAUGHTER)I -- I ACTUALLY NEVER FINISHED
READING THE STORY, SO I'M NOTEXACTLY SURE THAT HAPPENED.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BIDENSHOWS UP, I KNOW THAT HIS BOSS
IS DEFINITELY TAKING ARAIN CHECK ON THIS ONE.
>> I'M DECLINING TO MEET WITHHIM SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR GENERAL
POLICY IS WE DON'T MEET WITH ANYWORLD LEADER TWO WEEKS BEFORE
THEIR ELECTION.
HE NEEDS TO BE FAR AWAY ENOUGHFROM THE ELECTION THAT IT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IN SOME WAYSWE'RE MEDDLING OR PUTTING OUR
THUMBS ON THE SCALE.
(LAUGHTER)YES!
YES!
AMERICA DOESN'T WANT TO MEDDLEIN A MIDDLE EASTERN NATION'S
DOMESTIC POLITICS!
I MEAN, WE DON'T DO THAT!
UNLESS, OBVIOUSLY, A COUNTRYWANTED TO NATIONALIZE ITS OWN
OIL INDUSTRY OR LOOKED LIKELY TOALLY WITH A RIVAL SUPERPOWER
OR WAS FIGHTING A PROXY WARAGAINST SOME OTHER COUNTRY
THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE OR WOULD LETUS PUT MILITARY BASES IN THEIR
COUNTRY OR SENDPRISONERS TO THEIR COUNTRY
OR WAS NEXT TO A COUNTRY WEWANTED TO SPY ON
OR FIGHT WITH OR -- BUT ASIDEFROM
THESE VERY RARE INSTANCES --(LAUGHTER)
-- WE DO NOT MEDDLE MANY MIDDLEEASTERN NATIONS.
BESIDES, NETANYAHU DOESN'T NEEDOUR MEDDLING TO WIN THE
ELECTION.
HE'S ALREADY WINNING THEINTERNET.
>> A CAMPAIGN AD FROMISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU THAT HAS NOW GONEVIRAL --
>> Jon: VIRAL! CAMPAIGN ADSALMOST NEVER GO VIRAL.
USUALLY THAT'S RESERVED FOR CATSHENANIGANS OR SKATE BOARD FAILS
OR THE EVER RARE SCAT BOARD CATSHANANAFAIL!
OLD INSPECTOR WHISKERS HAS AMILLION FOLLOWERS.
WELL I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THATTHIS AD MUST BE EPIC.
♪♪(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
>> IS MA THE BABY SITTER?
BABY SITTER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: NUMBER ONE, I'M
SURPRISED THE HEBREW WORD FORBABY SITTER IS BABY SITTER.
BUT IT'S A PUN, I GET IT! IT'SUH --
HE'S A BABY SITTER BUT HIS NAMEIS BIBI SO HE'S A BIBI SITTER.
TURNS OUT JEWS CAN'T BE FUNNY INEVERY COUNTRY.
OH, SON OF A BITCH!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
HOW IS THAT WORKING?
