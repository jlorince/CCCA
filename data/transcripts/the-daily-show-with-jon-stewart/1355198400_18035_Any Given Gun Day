>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
BISHOP GENE ROBINSON IS GOING TO BE HERE A ALL I KNOW ABOUT RELIGION IS THIS: APPARENTLY HE
CAN ONLY MOVE DIAGONALLY.
THAT'S A CHESS MOVE, BABY.
A BISHOP CHESS JOKE.
LET ME JUST GIVE YOU MY LUNCH MONEY NOW.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE WORLD OF SPORT.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HERE KNOWS THIS.
I HAPPEN TO ENJOY SPORT.
I LIKE WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEM.
I LIKE LISTENING TO PEOPLE ON THE RADIO CALL IN TO TALK ABOUT SPORTS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE?
I MAKE CAN'T-MISS BETS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH MY WINNINGS?
YOU THINK I DO NICE THINGS WITH THEM FOR SOCIETY?
NO.
I SPEND ALL MY GAMBLING WINNINGS ON THE FIRST COMMERCIAL I SEE AFTER A GAME ENDS.
HELLO, BROOKLYN LANTERN.
LOOKS LIKE SOME PEOPLE WON'T HAVE TO EAT PASTA AGAIN WITH A FLASHLIGHT.
NO!
BY THE WAY I DO WANT TO TELL THAT WOMAN YOU COULD HAVE JUST SOMEBODY HOLD THE FLASHLIGHT.
THEN YOU COULD HOLD IT FOR SOMEBODY.
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU'RE REALLY FRUSTRATED.
THE SPORTS WORLD HAS SUFFERED TRAGIC OFF THE FIELD INCIDENTS.
THE DALLAS COW BUOYS LOST A PLAYER IN A DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENT AND THE MURDER-SUICIDE
A WEEK BEFORE.
THAT LED TO SPORTS COMMENTATOR BOB COSTAS COMMENTATING ON THIS AT HALF TIME
>> YOU WANT ACTUAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS?
A BIT OF IT COMES FROM THE KANSAS CITY BASED WRITER JASON WHITTLOCK FROM THE END OF HIS ARTICLE.
"OUR CURRENT GUN CONTROL ENSURES THAT MORE AND MORE DOMESTIC DISPUTES WILL END IN THE
ULTIMATE TRAGEDY.
IN THE COMING DAYS JAVAN BELCHER'S ACTIONS AND THEIR POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO FOOTBALL
WILL BE ANALYZED.
WHO KNOWS?
BUT HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE.
IF JAVAN BELCHER DIDN'T POSSESS A GUN, HE AND CASSANDRA PERKINS WOULD BOTH BE ALIVE TODAY SNIEM
AND NOW THE MARCHING BAND.
ALL RIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TRAGEDY.
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
IF WE'RE GOING TO START ADDRESSING ISSUES YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC ABUSE,
MENTAL ILLNESS, THE HEAD TRAUMA, THE FOOTBALL AND THE DRUGS THEY GIVE THE GUYS FOR PAIN.
I'M ASSUMING THAT COSTAS IS LEAVING TO THAT CLEATUS, THE FOX ROBOT.
STILL HE WAS TRYING TO START A CONVERSATION.
HE SUCCEEDED.
>> THAT BELONGED ON NBC CABLE CHANNEL.
THEN YOU EXPECT THAT OVER THERE.
YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT DURING A FOOTBALL GAME
>> IT'S NFL SUNDAY.
IT'S HALF TIME.
GOD BLESS AMERICA IS PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND.
DO I REALLY WANT BOB COSTAS GIVING ME A DISSERTATION ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
I WANT TO WATCH FOOTBALL
>> Jon: REALLY?
THAT'S WHEN I GO TAKE A PISS.
BUT OKAY.
YES AN NFL HALF TIME SHOW IS NO TIME TO TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE IN THE NFL.
IT'S A TIME TO WATCH ENDLESS SLOW-MOTION REPLAYS OF THAT TODAY'S HARDEST HITS.
THAT WAS A GREAT HIT.
YEAH, I THINK THE GUY'S BRAIN CAME OUT OF HIS EAR HOLE ON THAT ONE.
SUCKING IT UP LIKE A MAN.
