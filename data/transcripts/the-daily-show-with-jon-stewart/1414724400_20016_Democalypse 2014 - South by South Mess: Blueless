BLUE OVER, IF TEXAS IS RIPE TOTURN BLUE,
HOW DOES REPUBLICAN CANDIDATEFOR GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT CARRY
A 20-POINT LEAD AGAINST WENDYDAVIS IN THE LATEST POLLS?
20 POINTS. 20 POINTS. I ASSUME,I ASSUME THAT THAT POPULARITY
COMES FROM ABBOTT MAYBE STARTINGTO SELL HIMSELF TO BLUE-LEANING
TEXAS VOTERS AS ANENLIGHTENING CENTRIST.
HE SUED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION30 TIMES.

THREAT TO TEXASTHAN NORTH KOREA.

A BLUE GOVERNOR -- OR A MODERATEGOVERNOR OR ANYONE WHO EVEN A
DECADE AGO WOULD BE CONSIDERED AMAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN, IS THERE
ANYONE UP FOR STATEWIDE OFFICEWHO'S TOO FAR RIGHT FOR A TEXAS
THAT MIGHT BE TURNING BLUE?
HOW ABOUT THE LIEUTENANTGOVERNOR'S RACE?

CONSERVATIVE AND EVEN WALKED OFFTHE SENATE FLOOR DURING A MUSLIM
