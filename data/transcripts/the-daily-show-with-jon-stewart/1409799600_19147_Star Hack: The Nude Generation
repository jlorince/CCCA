>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, RORY KENNEDYWILL BE JOINING US.
SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE FILM,A GREAT DOCUMENTARY,
"LAST DAYS IN VIETNAM."
AND WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHINGAWAY, WE LOSE.
WE LOSE.
[LAUGHTER]BUT FIRST, FAMOUS NAUGHTY BITS.
>> THE F.B.I. IS INVESTIGATINGTHE PHOTO HACKING THAT TARGETED
HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES.
>> DOZENS OF NUDE AND RISQUEPHOTOS POSTED.
>> THIS TARGETED EVERYONE FROMAN OSCAR WINNER TO MUSIC
SUPERSTARS AND MODELS.
>> Jon: NO STAR WAS OFFLIMITS.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE][LAUGHTER]
THOSE WERE PERSONAL PICTURESTHAT SHE TOOK FOR TRAMP'S
BIRTHDAY, AND I FOR ONE AMUPSET.
HOW THE HELL DID A HACKER STEALPRIVATE PHOTOGRAPHS?
TO FIND OUT HOW THIS WAS DONE,YOU GOTTA GO TO THE EXPERTS.
>> NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHO DIDTHIS OR EXACTLY HOW THOSE PHOTOS
WERE OBTAINED.
>> IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO HACKEDTHE PHOTOS.
>> WHO UPLOADED THOSE PHOTOS.
>> WHO POSTED THE PHOTOS?
>> WE KNOW THAT THE DATA MADE ITON TO PHONES, AND WE KNOW THE
PHONES STORED THE PHOTOGRAPHS.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHATHAPPENED NEXT.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THEN WHY ARE YOU ON MY
TELEVISION?
ONCE AGAIN I LEAVE WATCHING THENEWS SOMEHOW KNOWING LESS THAN
WHEN I STARTED.
SO EVEN THE EXPERTS CAN'TEXPLAIN HOW THIS HAPPENED, BUT
ONE COMPANY IS ALREADY TAKING ANAWFUL LOT OF HEAT.
>> DATA HIDDEN WITHIN THE FILESREVEALS MOST OF THE IMAGES WERE
TAKE WITHIN AN APPLE iPHONE,WHICH IS WHY THE COMPANY'S
POPULAR ONLINE BACK-UP SERVICEICLOUD CAME UNDER INSTANT
SCRUTINY.
>> Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME THATSOMETHING NAMED AFTER WHAT
APPEARS FIRM AND STABLE BUT ISREALLY JUST A MASS OF WATER
VAPOR MIGHT PROVIDE ONLY THEILLUSION OF SECURITY.
[LAUGHTER]INTERESTING.
SO WHAT'S THE TAKEAWAY HERE?
BETTER SECURITY IN THE CLOUD?
YOUR TWO-STEP VERIFICATIONSTHERE OR MAYBE SOMETHING I DON'T
KNOW BLAMIER?
>> IF YOU DON'T WANT NUDEPICTURES OF YOURSELF TO APPEAR
TO THE WORLD, DON'T TAKE THENUDE PICTURES IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
>> DON'T TAKE PICTURES OFYOURSELF WITH YOUR GOODS AND
YOUR FACE.
>> DON'T TAKE NUDE PHOTOS.
>> TAKING PICTURES OFTHEMSELVES NAKED,
I'M JUST SORT OF STUCK ON THAT.WHY?
WHY?
>> Jon: YES.
WHY?
WHY WOULD A HUMAN BEING WANT TOLOOK AT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING'S
NAKED BODY?
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
AND WHY, WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TOTOUCH OTHER PEOPLE WHERE THEY GO
TO THE BATHROOM?
[LAUGHTER]WHY DO PEOPLE DO THAT?
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH JUSTWORKING ALL THE TIME?
I JUST WANT TO WORK AND TAKEKLONOPIN AND JUST HOPE IT ALL
GOES AWAY.
THAT'S FROM MY ONE-MAN SHOW.
[LAUGHTER]JONNY IS ASHAMED.
BUT I GET IT.
THESE WOMEN WERE ASKING FOR IT.
IT'S LIKE THEY SAID TO THEBOSTON STRANGLER'S VICTIMS, YOU
DON'T WANT TO GET STRANGLED, YOUSHOULDN'T HAVE HAD A NECK.
[LAUGHTER]LOOK, PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO
TAKE PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES DOINGWHATEVER INTIMATE THINGS THEY
WANT FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATEENJOYMENT WITH THE REASONABLE
EXPECTATION THAT THE INTERNETWILL NOT MAKE THEIR NIPPLES THE
NEXT DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK.
WHO BY THE WAY IS ACTUALLY APRAIRIE DOG.
I WANTED TO GET THAT OUT THEREFOR A LONG TIME.
IT'S A PRAIRIE DOG. HE WAS KNOWNAS THE DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK.
THE TRUTH IS HE'S A PRAIRIE DOG.
I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME TOSAY THAT.
[LAUGHTER]NOW I GOT NOTHING LEFT THE LOOK
FORWARD TO.
THE POINT IS ACCORDING TO THESEPEOPLE, THE LAWS COVERING
PRIVATE PROPERTY AND STEALINGARE SOMEHOW NULL AND VOID WHEN
IT COMES TO RECREATIONAL NUDITY.
>> IT'S THE SAME THING THATPARENTS KEEP THEIR KIDS ABOUT
SEXTING. YOU DON'T TAKE PICTURESAND SEND THEM TO SOMEBODY
AND EXPECT THEM NOT TO SHARETHEM WITH ANYBODY.
>> Jon: THESE PICTURES WEREN'TSHARED!
THESE ARE PICTURES OF THEIRPRIVATE PARTS.
THEY WERE PASSWORD PROTECTED.
THAT IS SAFER THAN EVEN PEOPLE'SPANTS WHERE PEOPLE KEEP THEIR
MONEY AND KEYS AND THEIR ACTUALPENII AND VAGINI.
AND BY THE WAY, FOR THOSEBLAMING THE CURRENT GENERATION
FOR ALL THIS, IT'S NOT LIKESTEVE JOBS INVENTED THE NUDE
PORTRAIT.
iPHONES AND THE INTERNET AREJUST A MORE EFFICIENT NUDITY
DELIVERING MECHANISM.
IN FACT, LET ME GIVE YOU MYIMPRESSION. HERE WE GO.
THIS IS MY IMPRESSION OF, WHATDO YOU CALL IT THERE, LIKE THE
INVENTOR OF THE POLAROID HERE.LET ME JUST, HOLD ON.
TEN SECONDS AFTER INVENTING THEPOLAROID, HERE'S MY IMPRESSION.
OH, THAT'S --[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]OH, YEAH!
