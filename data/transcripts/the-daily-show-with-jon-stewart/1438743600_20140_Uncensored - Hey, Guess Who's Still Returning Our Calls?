>> OH, MY GOSH, JON.
THEY ARE REAL AND THEY DO KNOWWHO WE ARE AND THEY DON'T CARE
BECAUSE WE BRING A CAMERA WITHUS.
>> Jon: WELL, PEOPLE LOVE TOBE ON THE TV.
>> IT'S TRUE.
IT'S LIKE "GIRLS GONE WILD,"EXCEPT THEY FLASH US THE
CONTROVERSIAL IDEAS.
RECENTLY, THOUGH, I DECIDED TOCHECK IN ON SOME OF OUR OLD
FRIENDS.
CHUCK, ROLL IT!
>> THE BLACK PERSON USES THETERM NIGGER THIS AND THAT AND
IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO DO IT.
>> A LARGE PORTION OF MALEHOMOSEXUALS ENJOY DRINKING EACH
OTHER'S URINE.
>> WE STARTED A NEW PHILANTHROPYCALLED GUNS FOR TOTS.
>> IF YOU'RE POOR, STOP BEINGPOOR.
>> I'M DOING EXORCISMS ON SKYPE.
>> WHEN HEARING THE SURPRISINGPOINT OF VIEWS ALL
CORRESPONDENTS KNOW THE BESTRESPONSE IS OFTEN THE HONEST
ONE.
>> WHAT?
>> I'M SORRY?
>> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
>> WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME RIGHTNOW?
>> YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE YOU,RIGHT?
>> SO JUST WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
ARE THEY ACTORS?
DID WE TRICK THEM INTO TALKINGTO US?
AND JUST WHAT ARE NAY DOINGSAYING THESE THINGS ON
TELEVISION?
TONIGHT WE'LL FIND OUT IN "GUESSWHO'S STILL RETURNING OUR
CALLS"!
BACK IN 2009, WE MET HARLEMPASTOR JAMES DAVIS MANNING, WHO
WAS SPEAKING OUT ON ATTACKS ONPRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA IS NOTTHE ANTI-CHRIST.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WHOEVER BELEIVES THAT ISSORELY MISLED.
HE IS NOT THE ANTI-CHRIST.
>> I'VE TALKED TO SO MANYCRAZY--
>> OBAMA IS INDEED THE NEXTHITLER.
>> COME AGAIN?
>> HITLER.
>> HITLER AS IN HITLER, HITLER?
>> THE FUEHRER OF GERMANY.
>> YEESH.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW THE DAILYSHOW COULD EDIT DR. PLANNING TO
MAKE HIM SAY SOMETHING SOOUTLANDISH.
SO LAST WEEK, I PAID HIM AVISIT.
HI!
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MEETINGWITH US.
>> THIS A PEACE OFFERING FROMTHE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE?
>> YEAH, WE'RE SORRY.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, I ACCEPT THIS.
>> SO AFTER THAT SEGMENT AIRED,TELL US ABOUT HOW YOU LOST THE
CONGREGATION.
>> I DIDN'T LOSE THECONGREGATION.
I DID NOT.
>> BUT THEY SCREWED YOU.
THEY EDIT IT SO YOU SAID OBAMAWAS HITLER.
THAT'S BANANAS.
>> IT ISN'T BANANAS AND I DIDSAY HITLER, YES, I COMPARED
OBAMA TO HITLER, YEAH, I DID.
>> OKAY, BUT THAT'S WHY PENCILSHAVE ERASERS.
HAS YOUR OPINION OF PRESIDENTOBAMA CHANGED IN THE LAST SIX
YEARS?
>> YES, IT HAS.
>> GREAT!
THAT'S AWESOME!
>> I THINK HE'S ACCOMPLISHEDSOMETHING NO ONE IN HUMAN
HISTORIES HAS ACCOMPLISHED ORCOULD ACCOMPLISH.
>> THAT'S WONDERFUL.
HE DID.
HE PUSHED FOR A LOT OF REFORM,LIKE FOR GAY MARRIAGE.
>> IF I CAN COMPLETE MYTHOUGHT -- THE THINGS HE HAS
ACCOMPLISHED ARE ULTRA EVIL.
IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OFEVIL SPIRIT AND DEMENTED, IF YOU
WILL, PERSONALITY TO DO WHAT HEHAS DONE.
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THISRIGHT.
YOU'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON WHAT YOUSAID SIX YEARS AGO.
>> YOU COULD SAY THAT, YES.
>> OKAY.
>> I'M LEANING MORE TOWARDSOBAMA BEING MORE LIKE THE SON OF
SATAN.
>> I'M SORRY...
YOU BELIEVE, NOW, HE'S MORE THESON OF SATAN?
>> YES, I DO.
>> WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT HEADOF YOURS?
>> PURE, UNMITIGATED TRUTH.
>> IN 16 YEARS, WE'VEINTERVIEWED ALMOST 2800 PEOPLE.
YOU WOULD ASSUME AFTERWARDS MOSTWOULD BE UPSET -- LIKE SAY GUN
RIGHTS ACTIVIST NOELFLASTERSTEIN.
>> IF A DOCTOR IS KEEPING A LISTOF HIS PATIENTS WHO HAVE
FIREARMS, THE GREAT FEAR IS IFTHEY START COLLECTING THIS DATA,
IT LEADS TO DICTATORS, TYRANTS,HITLER.
>> HOLOCAUST 2.
>> HOLOCAUST 2, EXACTLY.
>> WHAT IS IT WITH THESEBONEHEADS AND THE HOLOCAUST?
I WENT TO VISIT NOEL IN HIS TINYASS KITCHEN WITH HIS GIANTASS
GUNS, JUST TO SEE HOW ANGRY HEWAS.
>> DOING "THE DAILY SHOW" ISGREAT.
I OBVIOUSLY PUT A LINK OF IT ONMY WEBSITE SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE
IT AND I CAN SHOW IT OVER ANDOVER TO THE ALL MY FRIENDS.
HEY!
I WAS ON "THE DAILY SHOW," ITWAS GREAT.
>> ARE YOU SOME MASTER OFSARCASM?
>> OF COURSE NOT.
I LIKED IT.
I THOUGHT I DID WELL.
>> THEY DIDN'T TWIST YOUR WORDS?
NOT AT ALL.
ARE YOU SURE?
I'M 100% POSITIVE.
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WOULD SEE SOMEHUMOR IN MY VIEWS, BUT I DON'T.
>> IN FACT, IN OUR EXPERIENCE,THE VAST MAJORITY OF "THE DAILY
SHOW" INTERVIEWEES FEEL THE SAMEWAY.
DR. MANNING, DO YOU REGRET DOINGTHIS SEGMENT WITH US SIX YEARS
AGO?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT, NO. BECAUSE IUNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO
BE ON THE SHOW EXACTLY WHAT ITWAS GOING TO BE ABOUT, IT WAS
GOING TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO MAKEMY IDEAS SEEM BUFFOONERY, BUT I
AGREED TO DO IT ANYWAY, BECAUSEI DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD SUCCEED
AT IT, AND YOU DIDN'T.
>> YOU THINK WE DIDN'T SUCCEEDAT IT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DID ITYOURSELF.
>> WELL, YOU CAN SAY THAT IF YOULIKE, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
GET THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OR THEINTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE TO AGREE
WITH YOU.
>> YEAH, WE PROBABLY WON'T.
AS WE HEAD INTO THIS NEW ERA OF"THE DAILY SHOW," ONE THING IS
CERTAIN, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILLSTILL BE COMPARED TO HISTORICAL
MADMEN AND FAR TOO MANY PEOPLEWILL STILL HOLD THEIR UNIQUE
POINTS OF VIEW.
>> I THINK THIS STARBUCKS ISRECOGNIZED THAT THE FLAVOR OF
THEIR LATTES THAT THEY ARE USINGSEMEN TO MAKE THAT LATTE MORE
FLAVORFUL.
>> YOU THINK THEY'RE USING SEMENTO FLAVOR THEIR LATTES?
>> I THINK SO, YES.
>> WHAT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE DOYOU HAVE THAT STARBUCKS IS USING
SEMEN IN THEIR LATTES?
>> WHAT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE DO IHAVE?
>> YES.
>> I THINK IF YOU'RE ASKING FORTHAT, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
FIND MY EXPLANATION SUITABLE TOMEET THE EMPIRICAL STANDARDS,
BUT LET'S JUST SAY I KNOW.
>> Jon: AND THANK YOU,JESSICE WILLIAMS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
