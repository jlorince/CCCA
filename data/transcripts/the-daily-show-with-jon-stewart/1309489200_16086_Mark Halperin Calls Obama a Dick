>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOT A BIG SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR OF "THE
WEEKLY STANDARD," WILL BE
JOINING US.
HE'S A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
YET, YET, I HOPE TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT A LESS CONTENTIOUS ISSUE
THAN THAT, LIKE AFGHANISTAN.
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT A SHOW.
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH
SOMETHING THAT I FOUND ON THE TV
BOX THIS MORNING THAT WAS MAYBE
ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS I'VE
EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
>> MARK HALPERIN.
WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S
STRATEGY?
>> ARE WE IN THE SEVEN-SECOND
DELAY TODAY?
>> OH, LORDY.
>> I WANT TO CHARACTERIZE HOW I
THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT BEHAVED.
>> WE HAVE IT.
WE CAN USE IT, RIGHT, ALEX?
>> YEAH, SURE, COME ON.
>> GO FOR IT.
>> I THOUGHT HE WAS KIND OF A
DICK YESTERDAY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: MARK HALPERIN, SENIOR
POLITICAL ANALYST, EDITOR AT
LARGE OF "TIME" MAGAZINE JUST
CALLED THE PRESIDENT A DICK.
AND THAT WASN'T LIKE A
SPONTANEOUS, LIKE, CAN'T CONTAIN
MYSELF, YOU LIE!
LIKE THIS ONE, YOU GUYS HAVE A
DELAY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO CALL
THE PRESIDENT A DICK.
NOW, PEOPLE CAN ARGUE WHETHER
THAT'S APPROPRIATE, WHETHER
HALPERIN CROSSED SOME SORT OF
LINE, WHETHER OR NOT JOURNALISM
HAS LOST ITS PROFESSIONALISM.
PERSONALLY I COULD GIVE A
( BLEEP ).
THAT HORSE LEFT THE BARN YEARS
AND YEARS AGO.
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT
WHAT HE DID IS NOT WHAT HE DID.
IT'S WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THEY
CAME BACK FROM THE COMMERCIAL.
>> JOKING ASIDE, THIS IS A PRO
FORMA APOLOGY.
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE APOLOGY.
HEARTFELT TO THE PRESIDENT AND
THE VIEWERS.
I BECAME PART OF THE JOKE BUT
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.
I MADE A MISTAKE AND I'M SORRY
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT AND
I APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESIDENT AND
TO THE VIEWERS WHO HEARD ME SAY
THAT.
>> Jon: NOW, NOW, YOU KNEW HE
WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE.
BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS HIS
APOLOGY WOULD BE CHAPERONED.
( LAUGHTER )
BY SHOW REGULAR WILLY GEIST'
DISAPPROVING GLARE.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
LOOK AT HIS FACE DURING THIS
APOLOGY.
LOOK AT IT!
IT IS A PERFECT MIX OF
DISAPPOINTMENT.
IT HAS A DASH OF SADNESS.
A SMIDGEN OF DISBELIEF.
ALL WITH JUST A HINT OF "WHY THE
( BLEEP ) AM I IN SOME SHOT?"
( LAUGHTER )
SERIOUSLY.
WHY IS HE IN THAT SHOT?
YOU CAN'T GRAB A ONE-SHOT?
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING BECAUSE
FOR MY MONEY, HAVING HIM THERE
WORKS.
IT HAS THAT LOOK OF, "NO,
MISTER!
YOU ARE GOING TO SIT HERE AND
YOU ARE GOING TO TELL
MR. FERGUSON WHY YOU BROKE HIS
( BLEEP ) WINDOW.
NOW WE'RE GOING OVER THERE RIGHT
NOW."
I ACTUALLY THINK FROM NOW OFROM
NOW ON, THIS GUY WILLY GEIST
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ALL OF OUR
APOLOGIES.
>> I HAVE MADE TERRIBLE MISTAKES
AND HURT THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT
THE MOST.
>> I'M DEEPLY SORRY FOR MY
IRRESPONSIBLE AND SELFISH
BEHAVIOR.
>> I APOLOGIZE TO THE PUBLIC,.
>> MY HURT CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE ELSE'S HURT.
>> I AM PROFOUNDLY SORRY FOR ALL
I HAVE DONE WRONG.
>> I REGRET DEEPLY ANY INJURY
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE.
>> I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WHAT?
WHAT?!
