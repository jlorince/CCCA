>> Jon: "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"CALLED THE GRAY LADY, PAPER OF
RECORD, GOLD STANDARD OFAMERICAN PRINT JOURNALISM.
OL' TIMESY.
AS WE HEAD INTO THE 2016PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NO ONE IS
ASKING HARDER QUESTIONS OF THECANDIDATES.
HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL SCANDAL.
JEB BUSH'S POSSIBLE FUNDRAISINGVIOLATIONS.
AND NOW THEY'VE SET THEIR SIGHTSON ONE OF THE HOTTEST,
FASTEST-RISING POLITICIANS INTHE RACE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE DEVASTATING.
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RAN ASTORY ABOUT SENATOR MARCO RUBIO
PARKING TICKETS AND HIS TRAFFICHISTORY.
>> SINCE 1997, THE COUPLE HASAMASSED 17 CITATIONS.
MOST OF THOSE TICKETS, 13IN ALL, WERE GIVEN TO JANET
RUBIO.
>> Jon: OH! [BLEEP].
MARCO RUBIO GOT FOUR TICKETSIN 17 YEARS.
I ASSUME "THE NEW YORK TIMES"OBTAINED THIS DAMNING
INFORMATION FROM MARCO RUBIO'SPLAQUE IN THE HALL OF BEST MIAMI
DRIVERS EVER.
[APPLAUSE]
HOW IS RUBIO GOING TO TALK HISWAY OUT OF THIS TOTAL SCANDAL?
>> I CAN TELL YOU BEING FROMMIAMI, WERE YOU DRIVER
EVERYWHERE, HAVING FOUR TICKETSIN 17 YEARS IS NOT CONSIDERED
BAD.
BUT LET ME JUST SAY, I DON'TLIKE RED LIGHT CAMERAS, THOUGH.
BIG SCAM.
>> Jon: YEAH!
AND WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?
I CAN'T CROSS THE STREET TILLTHE WHITE MAN SAYS IT'S OKAY?
THE NEW YORK CITY TIMES IS JUSTGETTING WARMED UP.
THIS MORNING, THE TIMES WROTE UPFRONT PAGE STORY THAT'S GOING
TO BLOW THE CHINOS OFF THERUBIO CAMPAIGN.
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES" THISWEEK DETAILED RUBIO'S DEBT AND
MORTGAGES, INCLUDING HISPURCHASE OF THREE HOMES, PUTTING
NO MONEY DOWN ON TWO OF THEM.AFTER A PUBLISHER PAID RUBIO
$800,000 TO WRITE A BOOK IN2012, THE SENATOR PAID OFF
$100,000 IN LAW SCHOOL LOANS.
>>  Jon: YOU BASTARD!
[LAUGHTER]
PAYING OFF LAW SCHOOL LOANS.
HOW DARE YOU?
AT LONG LAST, SENATOR, HAVE YOUNO SENSE OF INSOLVENCY?
UNLESS THERE'S MORE TO THISSTORY.
>> BUT HE ALSO PURCHASED AN$80,000, 24-FOOT FISHING BOAT
LIKE THIS, AND MORE RECENTLYLEASED A $50,000 LUXURY SUV.
>> Jon: OF COURSE HE LEASED IT.
NOT GOING TO BUY ONE.
YOU SEE THE WAY HIS WIFE DRIVES.
13 SPEEDING TICKETS.
NOW, LISTEN, THOSE MAY NOT SEEMLIKE PARTICULARLY EXTRAVAGANT
EXPENSES WORTHY OF A "NEW YORKTIMES" FRONT PAGE COVER STORY.
BUT IT'S A SLIPEPRY SLOPE.
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THEYSPLURGED ON A WHOLE HOUSE WITH
AN IN-GROUND POOL, HANDSOMEBRICK DRIVEWAY, METICULOUSLY
MANICURED SHRUBS AND OVERSIZEWINDOWS.
OVER SIZED WINDOWS!
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SENATOR, THENORMAL AMOUNT OF LIGHT ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
I'M SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, I LIKETO ROLL AROUND IN A GIANT PATCH
OF SUNLIGHT LIKE I'M A BIGOL' CAT.
HOW IS ANY OF THIS FRONT PAGENEWS.
I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE PERSONWHO WOULD BE BOTHERED BY THIS.
WELL, MAYBE ONE.
>> APPARENTLY MITT ROMNEY'SCAMPAIGN WHEN THEY WERE VETTING
HIM FOR VICE PRESIDENT FLAGGEDTHIS AS AN ISSUE.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF MITTROMNEY IS THE GUY TO VET PEOPLE
ON RESPONSIBLE SPENDING.
$80,000 ON A BOAT SLIGHTLY PALESIN COMPARISON TO $52 MILLION
ON A LOSING PIPE DREAM.
AT LEAST RUBIO HAS A BOAT TOSHOW FOR IT.
YOU MIGHT THINK "THE NEW YORKTIMES" IS WASTING TIME TREATING
INCONSEQUENTIAL GOSSIP LIKESERIOUS CONCERNS.
SURPSRINGLY, A NEW YORKTIMES REPORTER FEELS VERY
DIFFERENTLY.
>> WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT,EV ERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE
AND SPOUSE'S LIFE IS OPEN TOPUBLIC SCRUTINY.
THIS IS KIND OF THE GAME, RIGHT?
>> Jon: IT'S A GAME, IT'S A[BLEEP]ING GAME.
WHAT'S "THE NEW YORK TIMES"GOING TO DO, EXERCISE EDITORIAL
CONTROL?
NO.
IT'S LIKE T EIR MOTTO SAYS,DON'T HATE THE PAPER, HATE THE
GAME.
THE NEW YORK TIMES MIGHT THINKTHIS IS A ALL IN FUN, BECAUSE
THEY'RE PRINT.  A LITTLELIFESTYLES OF THE NOT RICH
ENOUGH AND FAMOUS.
BUT THEY FORGET WHAT A STORYLIKE THAT TURNS INTO ON THE TV.
>> SPLURGING ON LUXURY ITEMS?
NOT SAVING ENOUGH?
GET A PEEK INSIDE MARCO RUBIO'SBANK BOOK.
DO HIS PAST MONEY TROUBLESMATTER?
>> WOW.
SUDDENLY THE MAN WHO PAID OFFHIS STUDENT LOANS AND GOT A BOAT
IS PRINTING COUNTERFEIT HUNDREDSIN HIS BASEMENT.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, HE CAN'T DO IT IN HISLIVING ROOM, NOT WITH THOSE HUGE
[BLEEP] WINDOWS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
