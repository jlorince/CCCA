COMEDY CENTRAL
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW!
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER, I'M
IN FOR JON STEWART WHO IS
SPENDING THE SUMMER
UNDERCOVER POSING AS A
HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT POSING
TO BUST A DRUG RINK [BLEEP]
I THINK I JUST OUTED HIM.
NOW THEY'LL REALIZE HE IS
NOT A REAL TEENAGE GIRL.
GET OUT OF THERE REBECCA,

LEGS CAN CARRY YOU!
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO
TALK ABOUT THE FINAL BOOK BY
THE LATE, GREAT, DAVID
RACKOFF, SARAH VOWELL IS
GOING TO BE WITH US THIS
EVENING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN EGYPT,
BEST KNOWN FOR ITS
SPECTACULAR SUPPORTING ROLE
IN BRENDAN FRASIER'S THE
MUMMY AND THE MUMMY RETURNS.
HOW DID EGYPT NOT GET
NOMINATED FOR THAT MOVIE.
NOW IF YOU RECALL IN 2011
EGYPT HAD A BONA FIDE
PEACEFUL AND POPULAR
REVOLUTION ENDING THE RULE
OF LONG TIME DICTATOR HOSNI
MUBARAK AND USHERING IN
EGYPT'S FIRST FREE ELECTION
IN 5,000 YEARS.
WHEN OF COURSE A BIRD WITH
EYES WITH LINES UNDER IT WON
A COMFORTABLE EIGHT POINTS.
THEN IN 2012 MOM-- MO MAM ED
MORSI WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT
AND EGYPTIAN COULD COULD
ENJOY THE SWEET FRUITS OF
DEMOCRACY.
JUST ONE PROBLEM O EGYPT
DOES I HAVE WARM CLIMATE AND
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO
FRUIT.
>> JUST HOURS AGO THE
COUNTRY'S EXPERIMENT WITH
DEMOCRACY APPEARED TO GO UP
IN FLAMES.
THE MILITARY REMOVED
MOHAMMED MORSIST-- MORSI,
SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTION
AND INSTALLED THE COUNTRY'S
TOP JUDGE AS INTERIM
PRESIDENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, INTERIM
PRESIDENT, OR AS IT
INCREASINGLY IS BEING KNOWN,
THE ONLY KIND OF PRESIDENT
EGYPT HAS.
WELL, WE'VE GOT AN
OLD-FASHIONED MILITARY
COUPON OUR HANDS.
THE ARMY SUB VERSING THE
DEMOCRATIC WILL OF THE
PEOPLE, THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE
MUST BE DEVASTATED.
>> ARMY HELICOPTERS FLYING
EGYPTIAN FLAGS CIRCLED
OVERHEAD.
PROMPTING ROARS OF APPROVAL
FROM THE PROTESTORS IN
TAHRIR SQUARE.
>> A HEART DRAWN IN THE SKY,
MESSAGE FROM EGYPT'S
MILITARY, THEIR SUPPORTERS
ON THE SQUARE BELOW.
>> OH, EGYPTIAN AIR FORCE,
ARE YOU TRYING TO SEDUCE THE
ENTIRE POPULATION OF CAIRO?
BECAUSE FIRST THEY DID A SKY
WRITTEN VALENTINE.
THEN SOME SKY WRITTEN
FLOWERS AND THEN SOME SKY
WRITTEN HOOKUP PLANS FOR
LATER.
BUT MORSI WAS BARELY IN
POWER FOR-- GROW UP, GROW
UP.
MORSI WAS IN POWER BARELY
FOR A YEAR.
WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE
DONE TO MAKE EVERYONE SO
GLAD TO SEE HIM GO.
>> MORSI WAS GOING AROUND
PUTTING POLITICAL OPPONENTS
IN JAIL, HARASSING THEM,
PHYSICALLY INTIMIDATING
THEM.
>> IMPOSING HIS WILL AND
SIDELINING LIBERALS AND
MODERATE VOICES.
>> THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
HAVE CURVED RELIGIOUS FRO
DOM.
>> THE ECONOMY IS ON THE
BRINK OF COLLAPSE,
UNEMPLOYMENT IS TERRIBLE.
TOVER TURE IS NOW MORE UNDER
MORSI THAN MUBARAK.
>> WOW THAT IS AN IMPRESSIVE
AMOUNT OF STUFF IN JUST 12
MONTHS.
HE REALLY LIVED UP TO HIS
CAMPAIGN SLOGAN MORSI 2012,
SO WITH MORSI GONE
EVERYONE'S HAPPY EXCEPT,
HERE'S THE THING, THEY ARE
NOT.
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM A
LITTLE EARLIER MORSI WAS
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED WHICH
MEANS A LOT OF THE 13
MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT VOTED
FOR HIM ARE PRETTY PISSED
OFF.
THEY ARE PISSED OFF FIRST AT
THE ARMY AND SECONDLY
THEY'RE MAD WITH-- GUESS
WHO?
>> PROTESTORS LIKE ALLAH
REGULAR ABBY SAYS THE U.S.
TALKS ABOUT-- BUT DID
NOTHING TO PROTECT EGYPT
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
PRESIDENT.
>> MR. MORSI WILL BE BACK.
WILL BE BACK.
YES, WE CAN.
I WANT TO SAY TO OBAMA, YES,
WE CAN.
>> HEY, HEY, HEY!
THAT IS OUR UPLIFTING SLOGAN
TO BE IRONICALLY APPROPRIATED
AND SAR CASTICALLY THROWN
BACK INTO OUR PRESIDENT'S
FACE.
GET YOUR OWN!
BUT OKAY, OKAY.
SO MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IS
ANGRY WITH AMERICA.
SPOILER ALERT.
THAT'S FINE.
BECAUSE AT LEAST THIS WEEK
WE HAVE MORSI'S OPPONENTS ON
OUR SIDE.
>> THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
COMPLAINTS WITH THE U.S.
AS THIS POSTER MAKES CLEAR,
THEY BELIEVE AMERICA WAS TOO
CLOSE TO MOHAMMED MORSI AS
HIS CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC
PARTY.
>> HOLY [BLEEP].
>> SO EVEN NATIONS THOUGHT
OF ACTUAL
