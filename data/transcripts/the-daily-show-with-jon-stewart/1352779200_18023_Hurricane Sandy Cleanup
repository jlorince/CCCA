>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST MIKE HUCKABEE OF THE FOX NEWS PROGRAM HUCKABEE WILL BE ON THE PROGRAM.
HE'S CLEARLY LANDED IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR HIMSELF IN TERMS OF HOSTING.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU VERY QUICKLY, HURRICANE SANDY RELIEF EFFORTS STILL SLOWLY BUT SURELY ADVANCING.
THE RED CROSS, FEMA COMPANIES DOING A NICE JOB EXCEPT OBVIOUSLY THE POWER COMPANY IN
LONG ISLAND.
[BLEEP].
IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF YOU LOST POWER.
BUT HERE IS THE THING ABOUT THE CONDITIONS.
IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN YOU PROBABLY UNDERSTAND EVEN FROM THE VIVID AND HORRIFIC NATURE OF
THE IMAGES YOU'VE SEEN.
THE DESTRUCTION AND DEVASTATION.
THE CRAZY PART SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT AREA ARE PLACES HEAVILY POPULATED WITH OUR FIRST RESPONDERS.
FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE, SANITATION, E.M.T.s, ALL LIVE VERY HEAVILY IN THESE AREAS.
PEOPLE WE RELY ON WHEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE.
THE DEDICATION OF RESCUE WORKERS, VOLUNTEERS HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL BUT THERE'S STILL
HUGE NEEDS FOR HANDS-ON HELP OUT THERE.
WE WORK WITH A PARTICULARLY GREAT GROUP.
STATTEN ISLAND STRONG.
THEY'RE BEING FUNDED BY THE FOUNDATION THAT IS OUT IN STATTEN ISLAND.
YOU CAN DONATE.
NEEDS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING.
SO THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO HONESTLY IS SHOW UP IN PERSON WITH A CROWBAR.
OR HELP OUT AND SEND MONEY.
ALTHOUGH IF YOU DO FIND YOURSELF WITH EXTRA CROWBARS OR HEAVY GARBAGE BAGS OR GLOVES OR MASKS
OR UNDERWEAR OR SHELTER, LET PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE, BOY, THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
