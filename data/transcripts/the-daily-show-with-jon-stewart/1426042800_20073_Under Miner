YOU KNOW, FIRST, YOU MAYREMEMBER FROM LAST WEEK,
WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM THEREHOUSE REPUBLICANS
INVITED THE BIBI NETANYAHU TOCOME TO WASHINGTON
AND EXPLAIN WHY OBAMA IS SOWRONG TO TRY AND MAKE A NUCLEAR
AGREEMENT WITH IRAN!
AND THEN TO HAVE SOME CAKEBECAUSE, WHEN YOU INVITE A PRIME
MINISTER FROM ISRAEL, IT IS ONLYPOLITE AFTER A JOINT SESSION TO
PROVIDE A GANACHE.
THAT'S THE RULE OF MY PEOPLE.
I WILL COME, I WILL TALK TO YOURCONGRESS, BUT I'M HOPING THERE'S
CAKE!
(LAUGHTER)IT WAS WIDELY SEEN AS A
DISRESPECTFUL GESTURE BY HOUSEREPUBLICANS TO A SITTING
PRESIDENT, SO, NATURALLY, SENATEREPUBLICANS WANTED IN AS WELL.
>> 47 REPUBLICAN SENATORSMEANWHILE HAVE NOW WRITTEN AN
OPEN LETTER TO THE LEADERS OFIRAN WARNING THEM ABOUT ANY
NUCLEAR DEAL THEY MAY SIGN WITHPRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Jon: IRAN!
DON'T SIGN A DEAL WITH OBAMA!
YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM!
IRAN!
BE CAREFUL!
WE THINK HE MIGHT BE A MUSLIM!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
WAIT! OH, WAIT, WHAT?
NO!
WHY WOULD THEY BE WARNING IRANABOUT THIS?
>> ANYTHING NOT APPROVED BYCONGRESS IS A MERE EXECUTIVE
AGREEMENT.
>> THE NEXT PRESIDENT COULDREVOKE SUCH AN EXECUTIVE
AGREEMENT WITH A STROKE OF A PENAND FUTURE CONGRESSES COULD
MODIFY THE TERMS OF THEAGREEMENT AT ANYTIME.
>> Jon: OH, THEY'RE NOT WARNINGIRAN ABOUT OBAMA, THEY'RE
WARNING IRAN ABOUT THEMSELVES!
(LAUGHTER)YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET OBAMA TO
CONSTRUCT A FRAMEWORK OFVERIFIABLE NUCLEAR LIMITATIONS
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE LIFTING OFSANCTION BUT YOU WILL NEVER
SNEAK THIS (BLEEP) PAST US!
WE'RE (BLEEP) CUCKOO!
WE'RE CUCKOO BANANAS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'RE THE WORLD'S MOST
DELIBERATIVE BODY ANDYET WE'RE (BLEEP) NUTS.
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS, THEREPUBLICANS DIDN'T WRITE THAT
LETTER JUST TO SABOTAGE ANUCLEAR DEAL WHILE HUMILIATING
THE PRESIDENT.
THEY ALSO WANTED TO CONDESCENDTO IRAN ABOUT HOW OUR DEMOCRACY
WORKS.
>> THEIR LETTER STARTED OUT WITHTHIS "IT HAS COME TO OUR
ATTENTION WHILE OBSERVINGYOUR NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS
WITH OUR GOVERNMENT THAT YOUMAY NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM."
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL LEAVEOFFICE IN JANUARY 2017 WHILE
MOST OF US WILL REMAIN IN OFFICEWELL BEYOND THEN, PERHAPS
DECADES.
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,AYATOLLAH!
IN A DEMOCRACY, PRESIDENTS COMEAND GO, BUT SENATORS STAY IN
POWER FOREVER!
NO MATTER HOW OLD OR DANGEROUSOR SPITEFUL OR (BLEEP) THEY ARE!
AND THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CANDO ABOUT REMOVING THEM!
BUT I GUESS DICTATORS WOULDN'TUNDERSTAND THAT.
(LAUGHTER)WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS STUPID
LETTER ANYWAY?
>> TOM COTTON, THE FRESHMANSENATOR CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
BUT WHAT WAS REMARKABLE IS THATHE WAS ABLE TO GET THE ENTIRE
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, THREEPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR 2016
ON THE G.O.P. SIDE TO SIGN ON.
>> Jon: THAT IS REMARKABLE.
HOW DID COTTON CONVINCEREPUBLICANS TO PUBLICLY UNDERCUT
OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT?
HOW DID HE DO IT?
IT'S THE KIND OF PERSUASIVERHETORIC IT MIGHT TAKE TO GET,
LET'S SAY, AN UNFIXED DOG TOHUMP A PILLOW.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
WELL, GEE...
I DON'T...
UH -- ARE YOU SURE THIS IS OKAY?
THE PILLOW LOOKS PRETTYEXPENSIVE, I JUST -- OH!
OH!
THAT IS EMBROIDERED!
WHOA!
I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION HEREIS CONTEXT!
WHAT IS THE CONTEXT?
IS PRESIDENT OBAMA USINGEXECUTIVE AGREEMENT IN AN
EXCESSIVE OR UNUSUAL MANNER?
WELL THE ANSWER TO THAT APPEARSTO BE NO (BLEEP) WAY.
RONALD REAGAN, PEACE BE UPONHIM, SIGNED OVER 1,500 EXECUTIVE
AGREEMENTS INCLUDING A NUCLEARDEAL WITH CHINA AND A HOSTAGE
DEAL WITH -- OH, HOW DO IPRONOUNCE THIS -- I-RAN, IRAN!
I WONDER IF THAT IRAN IS IN ANYWAY RELATED TO THE ONE OBAMA IS
DEALING WITH?
I'M SURE IT'S COMMON NAME INTHAT PART OF THE WORLD.
I KNOW REAGAN WOULD NEVER DEALWITH SUCH A LOATHESOME REGIME.
SO PRETTY CLEAR THE PRESIDENT ISWELL WITHIN HIS CONSTITUTIONAL
PREROGATIVE.
NOW CONGRESSIONAL SUBVERSIONVIS-A-VIS FOREIGN POLICY,
HOW NEW IS THAT?
>> DEFYING WHITE HOUSEOBJECTIONS TO HER VISIT,
PELOSI MET THIS WEEK WITH SYRIANPRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD IN AN
ATTEMPT TO OPEN A DIALOGUEWITH A LEADER THE PRESIDENT HAS
SOUGHT TO ISOLATE.
>> Jon: OH, (BLEEP).
DEMOCRATS DID THE SAME THING TOPRESIDENT BUSH.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.
JUXTAPOSITIONAL SOUND BITE!
♪ JUXTAPOSITIONAL SOUNDBITE THEATER! ♪♪
>> Jon: YEAH, WE DO WORK HARDTO TRY AND MAKE THIS (BLEEP)
INTERESTING.
(LAUGHTER)SO...
HOW DID THE DEMOCRATS FEEL ABOUTPELOSI'S INTERFERENCE IN FOREIGN
POLICY IN 2007?
>> I APPLAUD SPEAKER PELOSI.
I HAVE LONG ADVOCATED ENGAGEMENTWITH COUNTRIES IN THE REGION
INCLUDING IRAN AND SYRIA.
>> TIME HAS COME FOR MEMBERS TOBEGIN TO GO TO SOME OF THESE
COUNTRIES AND ESTABLISH THEIROWN DIALOGUE.
>> WHY DID "THE WASHINGTON POST"TRASHING NANCY PELOSI FOR DOING
BASICALLY WHAT JIM BAKKER ANDLEE HAMILTON SAID TO DO, ENGAGE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OVER THERE INTHE MIDDLE EAST?
>> Jon: AND HOW DO THEY FEELABOUT THE REPUBLICAN LETTER NOW?
>> EITHER THESE SENATORS WERETRYING TO BE HELPFUL TO THE
IRANIANS OR HARMFUL TO THECOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
>> DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DIANEFEINSTEIN CALLED IT "A HIGHLY
INAPPROPRIATE AND UNPRECEDENTEDINCURSION."
>> IS THIS WHERE WE STAND IN THECOUNTRY WHERE THE OPPOSITION
REPUBLICANS WILL TRY ANYTHING TOSCUTTLE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT'S
NOBLE EFFORTS TO AVOID A WAR?
>> Jon: THOSE LOOK LIKEEXACTLY THE SAME PEOPLE!
(LAUGHTER)NOW, OF COURSE, I CAN
ONLY ASSUME CONSERVATIVES FEELTHE OPPOSITE IN BOTH INSTANCES.
>> IF THE DEAL IS THAT FRAGILE,THEY DON'T HAVE A DEAL.
SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF THEHOUSE OPINE ON FOREIGN POLICY
ALL THE TIME.
>> IT CONFUSES PEOPLE WHEN THEYSEE THE LEADER OF ONE OF THE
HOUSES OF CONGRESS OFFATTEMPTING TO CONDUCT
FOREIGN POLICY.
>> THE REPRESENTATIVES ARELOOKING FOR A WAY TO
HAVE SOME INPUT BECAUSEPRESIDENT OBAMA
HAS CUT THEM OUT OF THE PROCESS.
>> IT DOES SORT OF DEFYCOMMON SENSE.
IT DOES NOT HELP THESITUATION.
>> 47 CONGRESSMEN SENT OUT AMESSAGE TO THE IRANIAN LEADERS
EDUCATING THEM ABOUT OURCONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF
GOVERNMENT.
>> I NEVER THOUGHT IN MYLIFETIME, COLONEL, THAT I WOULD
SEE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES AGAINST THE
WISHES OF HER OWN PRESIDENT,COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF GO AND ALLOW
HERSELF TO BE USED FORPROPAGANDA PURPOSES.
>> Jon: IT'S THE SAME (BLEEP)PEOPLE AGAIN.
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, WE COULDDO THIS ALL DAY.
WE DO DO THIS ALL DAY.
(LAUGHTER)WE ARE SAD MOLE PEOPLE.
CLEARLY, THE SITUATIONAL ETHICSOF THIS COUNTRY'S LEADERSHIP IS
EASY TO CATALOG, BUT THE REALTAKEAWAY FROM THIS SEEMS TO BE
NO MATTER HOW EVIL OUR PRESIDENTOR OUR CONGRESS BELIEVES IRAN TO
BE, THEY WOULD EACH RATHER DEALWITH THE AYATOLLAH THAN EACH
OTHER.
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE THEY CAN WORKWITH.
(LAUGHTER)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
