[LAUGHTER]
THE POINT IS, IT WILL UNDENIABLY
BE ENTERTAINING TO HAVE WEINER
AND SPITZER RUNNING FOR OFFICE
AGAIN GIVING THEIR PAST, THOUGH,
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE EITHER OF
THEM ACTUALLY WINNING.
>> ANTHONY WEINER IS STEADILY
INCREASING HIS LEAD, PULLING
AHEAD OF CHRISTINE QUINN 25% TO
22%.
ELIOT SPITZER BARELY HAS BEEN IN
THE RACE FOR A WEEK AND ALREADY
HE'S LEADING MANHATTAN BOROUGH
PRESIDENT SCOTT STRINGER 48% TO
33%.
>> John: WOW.
ANTHONY WEINER AND ELIOT SPITZER
SURPRISING EVERYONE WITH THEIR
SOLID POLLING.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH, TO BE FAIR, IS KIND OF
THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES.
FOR MORE ON THIS WE'RE JOINED BY
SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT
SAMANTHA BEE.
>> YEAH.
>> John: SAM, IT LOOK LIKE
WEINER AND SPITZER COULD
ACTUALLY WIN THEIR RACES.
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE, ISN'T IT?
>> I KNOW, JOHN, IT TRULY IS A
GREAT DAY FOR CHILDREN ACROSS
THIS NATION.
>> John: SORRY.
HOW ON EARTH IS THIS A GREAT DAY
FOR CHILDREN?
>> OH, NO, JOHN, THINK ABOUT IT.
MOST OF TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE
FEEL LIKE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE
A FUTURE IN POLITICS AND IT'S
HARD TO ARGUE WITH THEM.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ON FACEBOOK
24/7.
THEY'RE SEXTING AND TWITPICKING
AND OVERSHARING EVERYTHING
THEY'VE GOT AND DESTROYING ANY
CHANCE OF A POLITICAL CAREER
BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW THEY WANT
ONE.
EVERY PARENT DREADS THAT MOMENT
WHEN THEY HAVE TO SIT THEIR
COLLEGE-AGED KID DOWN AND SAY,
HONEY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
PRESIDENT OR EVEN CITY
COMPTROLLER BECAUSE YOU LIKE
INSTAGRAM AND TEQUILA MAKES YOUR
CLOTHES FALL OFF.
>> John: I SEE.
I SEE.
SO IN A SENSE, PROSTITUTE
JOHNSON AND DICK PIC MCGEE ARE
TRAILBLAZERS?
>> YES.
WEINER AND SPITZER ARE DOING IT
FOR GENERATION JUNK SHOT.
REMEMBER THAT ICONIC PHOTO OF
THE LITTLE BOY TOUCHING OBAMA'S
HAIR BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE HIS
OWN.
JON JON I ACTUALLY REMEMBER
THAT.
THAT WAS A MOVING PHOTO.
>> WELL, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS
A THAT LONG-WAVING FRAT BOY
WAITING FOR HIS IDOL TO TELL
HIM, YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
BE AND AMERICANS WILL JUDGE YOU
BY THE COLORFULNESS OF YOUR
CHARACTER, NOT BY THE CONTENT OF
YOUR CAMERA PHONE.
>> John: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,
SAM.
THANK YOU.
SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYONE.
