I AM, I AM, I'M GONNA SAY THIS.
I AM FULL.
I AM FULL.
I MAY ACTUALLY SLEEP TONIGHT INA FLOUR TORTILLA.
I MAY JUST GO IN IT AND JUSTROLL UP.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY ASK YOUAT NIGHT.

REPRESENTING TEXAS' 20thCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
JOAQUIN CASTRO WILL BE JOININGUS A LITTLE BIT LATER.
BUT FIRST, BEFORE WE GET TOTHAT.
THE PRESIDENT.
NOBODY LIKES HIM.
EVERYONE HATES HIM.
ACCORDING TO GET WHITE HOUSEPRESS SECRETARY
JOSH EARNEST, THERE ARE REPORTSTHAT THE PRESIDENT THINKS
HE SHOULD EAT SOME WORMS.
EVEN DEMOCRATS RUNNINGFRANTICALLY FROM BARACK OBAMA
LIKE HE WAS THE BAD GUY IN ONEOF THOSE CHAIN SAW MASSACRE
MOVIES YOU HAVE HERE EVERYCOUPLE OF YEARS.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'SDEMOCALYPSE 2014:
POTUS PARTEM DEPRESSION.
HOW TOXIC IS THIS PRESIDENT?ENOUGH TO TURN EVEN THE MOST
INNOCUOUS OF QUESTIONS INTO AGOTCHA.
KENTUCKY SENATE CHALLENGERALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES.
>> DID YOU VOTE FOR PRESIDENTOBAMA 2008, 2012?
>> YOU KNOW, THIS ELECTION ISN'TABOUT THE PRESIDENT.
IT'S ABOUT -->> I KNOW.
BUT DID YOU VOTE FOR HIM? DIDYOU VOTE FOR HIM?
>> IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE --I WAS ACTUALLY AN '08 DELEGATE
FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
>> SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TOANSWER.
>> AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THAT THEPRESIDENT IS ON THE BALLOT.
>> Jon: THAT LOOKED LIKE ADEPOSITION FROM A MURDER TRIAL.
PRESIDENT WHO?
I LOVE HOW THE REPORTER JUST,WELL, WAS HE ON THE BALLOT?
HOW ABOUT THIS?[BLEEP] MARRY OR VOTE FOR
BRAD PITT, GEORGECLOONEY, BARACK OBAMA.
WHAT? GO.
ALRIGHT, SO CLEARLYOBFUSCATION IS ONE WAY
TO AVOID DESTROYING YOURCAMPAIGN BY
ASSOCIATING IT WITH THE LEADEROF YOUR PARTY.
WHEREAS ARKANSAS DEMOCRATICSENATOR MARK PRYOR WENT
FOR THE DELAY OF GAME PENALTY.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION HAS DONE AN
APPROPRIATE JOB HANDLING THEEBOLA CRISIS?
>> I WOULD SAY THAT -- IT'S HARDTO KNOW BECAUSE.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: YOU ARE ACTING LIKE SHE
FOUND YOUR PORN.
IS THIS YOUR PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE?
UHHH -- NOOOO.
I WOULD SAY --ARE YOU ASLEEP YET?
[LAUGHING]EVEN THOSE WHO MANAGED TO ADMIT
THAT YES, THEY DID VOTE FOR THEPRESIDENT CAN'T EVEN SEEM TO
SUMMON THE COURAGE TO STANDBEHIND THE DECISION.
>> SENATOR MARK BEGICH TELLINGTHE WASHINGTON EXAMINER I DID,
MEANING VOTE FOR PRESIDENTOBAMA.
BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT.
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT RELEVANT.
HE'S GONE IN TWO YEARS.
>> Jon: TWO YEARS.
HE ONLY HAD A FOUR YEAR TERM!
TWO YEARS IS HALF HIS TERM.
THE REST OF THE SUPER BOWL ISN'TRELEVANT.
IT WILL BE GONE IN TWO QUARTERS.
I'M NOT -- HOW IRRELEVANT IS THEPRESIDENT?
IRRELEVANT ENOUGH THAT EVEN HISOWN PRESS SECRETARY WON'T
MENTION HIM DURING A SPIRITEDDEFENSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
RELEVANCE.
>> SENATOR BEGICH IS CERTAINLYENTITLED TO HIS OPINION, BUT
I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OFAMERICANS WOULD AGREE THAT
WHOEVER THE SITTING PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES HAPPENS
TO BE IS RELEVANT IN A LOTOF IMPORTANT WAYS.
>> Jon: WHETHER THAT SITTINGPRESIDENT HAPPENS TO BE ABRAHAM
LINCOLN OR AS IS THE CASE NOWPRESIDENT CURRENT OCCUPANT.
NOW THE ENVIROMENT, THEENVIROMENT FOR DEMOCRATS THE
ENVIRONMENT FOR DEMOCRATS IS SOBAD RIGHT NOW THAT IN KENTUCKY
THEIR SENATE CANDIDATE ALISONLUNDERGAN GRIMES IS LOSING TO
A GUY WHO HAS TO RECRUITENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTSERS THE
SAME WAY YOU HAVE TO RECRUITPEOPLE TO A
TIME SHARE PRESENTATION.
>> ALL EXPENSES PAID TO CHEER ONSENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL.
>> AN E-MAIL FROM MCCONNELL'SCAMPAIGN STAFF ASKS FOR
VOLUNTEERS TO JOIN HIM ON A BUSTRIP THIS WEEK AND HELP
CONTRIBUTE TO ANENTHUSIASTIC ATMOSPHERE
AT CAMPAIGN EVENTS. THE MEMOSAYS THE TRIP IS FREE.
MEALS, TRANSPORTATION, HOTELSFOR TWO NIGHT TAKEN CARE OF.
>> Jon: HANDS OFF THE MINIBAR.
[LAUGHING]THERE IS NOT ENOUGH.
THIS GUY HAS BEEN IN THE SENATEFOR 30 YEARS.
HE'S ABOUT TO BE THE MOSTPOWERFUL REPUBLICAN IN THE
SENATE.
HE'S GOT TO BUY FRIENDS ANDMANIPULATE HIS LIKABILITY.
>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE TRYTO TELL ME HOW TO DO MY
COMMERCIALS. HEY MITCH, WHATABOUT USING A TALKING BABY.
THAT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE.
>> WELL AND WITH YOU ANDBLOODHOUNDS.
>> YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS ISN'TSUCH A BAD IDEA.
I'M MITCH MCCONNELL AND IAPPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
[LAUGHING]>> IT TURNS -- IT TURNS OUT,
EVEN THROUGH LINEN PANTS
A BLOOD HOUND'S TONGUE
FEELS PRETTY GOOD ON THETESTICLES.
PRETTY GOOD INDEED.
LIKE A SAND PAPER BATH FOR YOURBALL SACK.
IT'S PRETTY, PRETTY -- BUT NOTHING BETTER
ILLUSTRATES THE TURD HOLE THEDEMOCRATS ARE IN RIGHT NOW THAN
NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATE RACEBETWEEN SCOTT BROWN AND
JEANNE SHAHEEN. THISBROWN-SHAHEEN RACE HAS BEEN
UNBELIEVABLE. AND BYTHE WAY, IF THERE ISN'T ALREADY
A BROWN SHAHEENIN URBAN DICTIONARY,
I'M SURE THERE IS NOW. HOW'STHAT RACE SHAPING UP?
>> A NEW CNN RESEARCH POLLSHOWS THAT THE RACE IS EXTREMELY
TIGHT. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JEANNESHAHEEN LEADS REPUBLICAN
SCOTT BROWN BY TWO POINTS.49-47% AMONG LIKELY VOTERS.
A STATISTICAL TIE AFTER THEMARGIN OF ERROR IS INCLUDED.
>> Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]? JEANNESHAHEEN IS THE
INCUMBENT. SHE'S GOT HIGHFAVORABLES.
SHE'S POPULAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
SHE'S A POPULAR FORMER NEWHAMPSHIRE FORMER GOVERNOR.
HER NAME IS 10 TIMES FUNNER TOSAY THAN SCOTT BROWN.
SHAHEEN MACHINE! SHE IS AWOMAN SO NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT EVEN
A SNOW SHOE WEARING SLAB GRANITECOVERED IN BEAUTIFUL
FALL FOLIAGE IS LIKE, WE GET ITYOU'RE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.
AND SHE'S STATISTICALLY IS TIEDWITH THIS GUY.
>> SCOTT BROWN WAS, OF COURSE,ASKED ABOUT BEING A CARPET
BAGGER AND CROSSING THE BORDERIN MASSACHUSETTS.
AND HIS COMMENT HAS DRAWN A LOTOF ATTENTION.
HE SAID DO I HAVE THE BESTCREDENTIALS?
PROBABLY NOT.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
BUT I HAVE LONG AND STRONG TIESTO THE STATE.
>> Jon: PROBABLY NOT.
WHAT?
WHAT THE WHAT?
PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOWWHATEVER.
[LAUGHING]ARE YOU RUNNING FOR SENATE OR
ANSWERING WHETHER OR NOT MILEYIS GETTING BACK WITH LIAM.
SEEMS PRETTY CAVALIER FORSOMEONE SO CONCERNED WITH
AMERICA'S SECURITY.
>> RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTSARE THREATENING TO CAUSE THE
COLLAPSE OF OUR COUNTRY.
THERE'S DEEP CONCERNS THAT THEREARE MEMBERS OF ISIS
ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH THEBORDER RIGHT NOW.
>> I WANT TO SECURE THE BORDERAND KEEP OUT THE PEOPLE WHO
WOULD DO US HARM.
>> Jon: I MEAN, I KNOW HOWPOROUS NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER'S
ARE. I'M NOT EVEN FROM HERE ANDI'M ALMOST YOUR SENATOR.
AND BY THE WAY, SCOTT BROWN HASALREADY BEEN A SENATOR.
SO HOW WAS SCOTT BROWN'S BORDERVIGILANCE WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR?
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTSTODAY THAT BROWN MISSED ALL SIX
HEARINGS ON BORDER SECURITY WHENHE WAS A SENATOR FROM
MASSACHUSETS.
SHAHEEN IS TIED WITH THAT GUY.
THAT GUY.
BUT THAT'S WHERE THE DEMOCRATSARE AT.
NECK AND NECK WITH A REPUBLICANWHO ADMITS HE'S NOT THE BEST
CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR THE SENATEIN A STATE HE'S NOT FROM, ON A
ISSUE HE IGNORED WHEN HE WAS ASENATOR FROM THE A DIFFERENT
STATE. MY ADVICE TO DEMOCRATSTHIS ELECTION SEASON,
GRAB SOME PEANUT BUTTER AND SOMEOF THEM BLOOD HOUNDS.
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANYVOTES BUT SURE WILL FEEL NICE.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
