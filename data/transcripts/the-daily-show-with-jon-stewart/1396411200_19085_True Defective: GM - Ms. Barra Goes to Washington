[ LAUGHTER ]GM HAS KNOWN FOR OVER A DECADE
ABOUT A DEADLY DESIGN FLAW,WAITED YEARS TO ATTEMPT TO FIX
IT.
BOTCHED THE FIX.THREATENED TO RECOOP LEGAL
COSTS FROM ANYBODYWHO TRIED TO LITIGATE THE ISSUE
AND WHEN THE (bleep) HITTHE FAN DECIDED MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO PROMOTE CARGAL AND SO ON JANURY 15,
2014 MARY BARRA TOOK OVER GMAND WAS SOON THERE AFTER
MEANINGING YESTERDAY OFFEREDAN ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP TO
WASHINGTON'S ROMANTICHOUSE HEARING ROOM.
>> THIS IGNITION SWITCH ISSUEWAS FIRST -- CAME TO LIGHT IN
2006, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> IT CAME TO LIGHT TO ME ONJANUARY 31, 2014.
>> Jon: HOLY (bleep).
THEY HIRED HER AND THEN TOLD HERDURING HER ORIENTATION.
[LAUGHTER]WELCOME MS. BARRA YOU'REGONNA LOVE
THIS PLACE. THERE'S YOUR DESKOVER THERE, THERE'RE SOME
BUSINESS CARDS, STATIONARYSUPPLIES, OBVIOUSLY IN THE
CLOSET IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVEANYTHING IN THE
BREAK ROOM FRIDGE YOU'REGONNA WRITE YOUR NAME ON IT.
THAT'S EVERYTHING I THINK.
OH, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEEASILY AVOIDABLE DEATHS OF AT
LEAST 13 PEOPLE.
AND THE LADIES ROOM IS DOWN THEHALL.
OKAY.
SO HOW DID CEO BARRA HANDLE IT?
>> AS SOON AS I LEARNEDABOUT THE PROBLEM WE ACTED
WITHOUT HESITATION.
WE'LL NOT SHIRK FROM OURRESPONSIBILITIES NOW OR IN THE
FUTURE.
TODAY'S GM WILL DO THE RIGHTTHING.
>> Jon: TODAY'S GM IS NOT ASHIRKER.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND IN FACT, THEY HIRED A LAWYER
THAT SPECIALIZES IN CASES WHEREVICTIMS ARE COMPENSATED SO THEY
PROBABLY HAVE A GREAT PLAN TOMAKE THIS RIGHT.
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEHIRING OF MR. FEINBERG INDICATES
THAT GM WILL GIVE SOME KIND OFSETTLEMENT?
>> IT WILL TAKE PROBABLY 30-60DAYS TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION.
WE'VE NOT MADE ANY DECISIONS.
WE'VE JUST STARTED THIS PROCESSWITH MR. FEINBERG.
>> AND THAT MIGHT INCLUDE PEOPLEWHO HAVE BEEN INJURED AS WELL.
>> WE'VE NOT MADE ANY DECISIONS.
>> Jon: WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'SGONNA SAY.
MAYBE OUR LAWYER WILL RECOMMENDWE JUST DANGLE MONEY IN FRONT OF
PEOPLE WITHOUT GIVE THEM ANYOR MAYBE THE FAMILIES OWE US
MONEY. WE JUST HAVETO WAIT AND SEE.
AND THIS IS WHERE OUR UP TO NOWPLEASANT CRUISE OF A STORY
ENCOUNTERS AN UNEXPECTEDCATOSTROPHIC
TECHNICAL PROBLEMAND CAREENS INTO A DITCH.
WHY WOULD GM HAVE THE ABILITY TOIN ANY WAY WAIT AND SEE HOW THEY
FEEL ABOUT SETTLING THESE CASESWITH THESE CLEARLY WRONGED
FAMILIES?
HOW ARE THEY NOT AUTOMATICALLYLIABLE FOR DAMAGES?
>> UNDER THE TERMS OF THEEMERGENCE FROM FEDERAL
BANKRUPTCY PROTECTIONIN 2009 THE NEW
GENERAL MOTORS IS NOT LIABLEFOR CLAIMS FROM ACCIDENTS THAT
HAPPENED BEFORE JULY OF THATYEAR.
>> Jon: TADA. AND ONCE AGAIN WELEARNED THAT NOT ONLY ARE
CORPORATIONS PEOPLE THEYHAVE SOME SORT OF WEIRD MUTANT
POWER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DODGETHE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR
ACTIONS.
BECAUSE GM DECLARED BANKRUPTCYTHEY ARE NO LONGER LEGALLY
LIABLE FOR HUMAN DEATHS THATTHEY CAUSED THROUGH THEIR
ADMITTED NEGLIGENCE.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR A NONCORPORATEPERSON TO TRY THAT (bleep).
NO, NO, YOUR HONOR, MY NAME ISNOT JEFFREY DAHMER. JEFFREY
DAHMER DECLARED MORALBANKRUPTCY A FEW YEARS BACK.
WHILE I DEEPLY REGRET THE OLDJEFFREY DAHMER'S ACTIONS.
I, JOFF DAMER AM NOT ON THEHOOK IN ANY WAY LEGALLY FOR THE
ADMITTED EATING OFSOME OF MY NEIGHBORS, I MEAN,
HIS NEIGHBORS. SO I'M JUST GOINGTO HEAD OUT, GET IN MY
CAR AND DRIVE AWAY. IT'S A FORDI'M NOT A MANIAC.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
