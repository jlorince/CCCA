NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU, JON.
THANK YOU.
>> Jon: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
MIGHTY BE OUR POWERS.
I CAN ONLY HOPE, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT I'M NEVER IN A SITUATION
THAT YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN IN
LIBERIA.
BUT IF I WAS, THAT I WOULD
HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP
AND DO WHAT YOU DID.
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT WITHIN
YOURSELF?
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING
ME ON THE TALK SHOW WITH THE
MOST POPULAR TALK SHOW HOST IN
AMERICA.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: I TOLD HER THAT IN THE
GREEN ROOM BACK STAGE.
YOU GUYS CAN KEEP IT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS A LITTLE JOKE WE WERE
HAVING.
>> IT'S ALSO GOOD TO HAVE THE
MOST POPULAR WOMEN'S RIGHTS
ACTIVIST IN AFRICA ON YOUR
SHOW.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I TELL PEOPLE WHEN THE WAR
STARTED IN 1989 I WAS 17 YEARS
OLD.
FROM 1989 UNTIL 2003 WHEN I
WAS 31, I LIVED IN FEAR.
BETWEEN THOSE YEARS I GAVE WAY
TO ANGER.
ANGER GAVE WAY THE NEED TO
TRANSFORM THE SOCIETY.
THAT POWER THAT CAME FROM
WITHIN, NOT JUST FROM MYSELF
BUT FROM MY SISTER, WAS
SOMETHING THAT OUR BROKENNESS,
THE RAPE AND ABUSE THAT A LOT
OF MY SISTERS SAW, THE DEATH
OF OUR CHILDREN AND RELATIVES,
IS JUST TELL PEOPLE ANGER IS
FLUID LIKE THIS WATER.
IF YOU PUT IT IN A CONTAINER
IT COMES OUT SHAPED LIKE ANGER
AND VIOLENCE WILL ERUPT.
WE TOOK OUR ANGER BECAUSE WE
HAD SEEN ANGER DESTROY OUR
COMMUNITIES AND DECIDED WE'RE
GOING TO USE IT TO TRANSFORM
OUR COMMUNITIES.
EVERY MORNING WE WOKE UP WITH
A RESOLVE THAT WE WOULD DO
SOMETHING.
IF WE DIE TRYING, FINE.
IF WE SURVIVE ONE DAY, FINE.
WE'RE AT THE END OF THE DAY
LIBERIA WAS THE KEY FOCUS FOR
US AS WOMEN.
>> Jon: IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
AND THE STORE... STORY THAT
YOU TELL, YOU GATHERED THESE
WOMEN TOGETHER AND YOU SAT IN
A FIELD.
THERE WAS A SOCCER FIELD.
>> SOCCER FIELD.
OPEN PLACE.
EVERY MORNING IT WAS LIKE....
>> Jon: TWICE A DAY.
>> EVERY DAY GO TO WORK, COME
BACK.
WE FELT LIKE IF PEOPLE WERE TO
SEE US, BECAUSE THE MEDIA
REPORT OF THE WAR WAS ALL
ABOUT THE MILL TARISM, THE
BOYS WHO HAD THE GUNS.
WE ACTUALLY WANTED FOR PEOPLE
TO SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
WAR.
WOMEN WITH CHILDREN WHO HAD
WALKED MILES, WHO STAYED
HUNGRY FOR DAYS REALLY PUTTING
THEMSELVES OUT THERE TO
PROTEST THE WAR, TO DO
SOMETHING.
SO WE SAT AT THAT OPEN FIELD.
THE BLAZING SUN, 90 DEGREES
SOMETIMES, 95 DEGREES CAME.
MET US THERE.
THE RAIN FELL.
MET US THERE.
WE DID NOT SERVE FOOD.
THE ONLY THING WE SEARCHED WAS
WATER.
WE CAME FROM 6:00 IN THE
MORNING UNTIL 6:00 IN THE
EVENING PROTESTING.
>> Jon: EVERY DAY.
AND THEN THE PEACE
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND CHARLES TAYLOR, YOU
FIND IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
>> NOWHERE.
WE WENT THINKING THAT THESE
NEGOTIATIONS WOULD TAKE THREE
WEEKS.
IT WAS GOING ON THREE MONTHS,
GOING NOWHERE.
WARLORDS WERE WEARING NICE
SUITS NOW.
THEY HAD GIRLS MASSAGING THEM,
LIVING THE LIFE THAT THEY
NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD LIVE.
ONE OF THESE DAYS WE GOT ANGRY,
BARRICADED THE HALL AND THEN
THE SECURITY PEOPLE DECIDED TO
ARREST ME.
I SAID I'LL MAKE IT EASY FOR
YOU.
I'LL STRIP NAKED SO THAT WHEN
YOU TAKE ME TO PRISON, IT WILL
BE EASY FOR ME.
BY THE TIME I STARTED TAKING
MY CLOTHES OFF MAYBE THEY WERE
AFRAID OF WHAT THEY WOULD SEE,
THEY ALL RAN AWAY.
>> Jon: THAT IS HOW YOU GOT IN
TO SEE CHARLES TAYLOR.
YOU BASICALLY JUST SAT THERE
IN FRONT OF THE OFFICE AND
SAID, UNTIL WE SEE THIS MAN,
WE'RE NOT GOING.
>> WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
WE WANT TO PARLIAMENT.
WE BARRICADED WHERE THEY
PARKED THEIR CARS.
IMAGINE TAKING OVER THE
CAPITOL BUILDING.
SOMETIMES I THINK THE
AMERICANS NEED TO DO THAT,
GIVEN THE STATE OF YOUR
NATION.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WE'VE BEEN TRYING.
>> YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TRYING TOO
HARD.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE THING WE
DID WRONG.
WE TOOK OUR CLOTHES OFF FIRST.
YOU HAVE TO WAIT.
>> YOU PROBABLY TOOK YOUR
CLOTHES OFF IN THE WRONG
LOCATION.
>> Jon: THAT'S PROBABLY IT.
THAT WAS THE OTHER THING THAT
YOU DID THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
YOU DECIDED TO ASK, BECAUSE
THE WOMEN IN THE RURAL COUNTRY,
IN THE AREA THAT COULDN'T GET
TO THE CITY, SUFFERED EVEN
MORE GREATLY.
YOU ASKED THEM TO STRIKE.
TO HOLD BACK.
HOW DID THAT WORK?
>> WELL, THESE WOMEN STARTED
PROTESTING ALSO.
I MEAN, THIS WAR STARTED AND
HAD BEEN 14 YEARS.
BY THE TIME WE STARTED
PROTESTING, THEY STARTED
PROTESTING.
WE DECIDED WE WOULD DO A SEX
TRACK.
THE GOOD MEN WERE NOT DOING
MUCH TO SAVE SOCIETY.
YOU SEE SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE
IN THE URBAN AREA THEY THINK
THEY KNOW.
THEY KNOW NOTHING.
WE WENT TO OUR MEN LIKE WE
WERE HAVING A SEX STRIKE.
THE ORAL WOMEN SAID WE'RE
FASTING AND PRAYING FOR PEACE.
IN THE GOOD BOOK WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO ANYTHING.
SO IF YOU JOIN US TO PRAY,
YOUR STRUGGLE FOR THE HUSBANDS
JOIN THEM.
FOR TWO YEARS THEY WERE ON A
SEX STRIKE AND THEY DIDN'T
KNOW THEY WERE ON SEX STRIKE.
ALL THEY KNEW IS THEY WERE
FASTING AND PRAYING.
>> Jon: CAN YOU SPEND FIVE
MINUTES WITH US?
WE HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL.
WE'LL PUT UP ON THE INTERNET.
WOULD YOU MIND SPENDING
ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX MINUTES
WITH US.
FASCINATING STORY.
THE BOOK IS CALLED MIGHTY BE
OUR POWERS.
IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLY CHARMING
AND VIVACIOUS ADVOCATE FOR
THIS.
WHEN YOU READ WHAT THIS
POWERFUL WOMAN HAS GONE
THROUGH IN THE COUNTRY OF
LIBERIA, YOUR COUNTENANCE IS
EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE.
SO PLEASE READ IT AND SEE IT.
