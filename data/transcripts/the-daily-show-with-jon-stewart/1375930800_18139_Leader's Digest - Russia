>> John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
I'M JOHN OLIVER.
I AM STILL IN FOR JON STEWART
WHO IS SCOURGE COMPETING TO BE
AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL.
OH, NO, THEY VOTED HIM OUT!
THEY VOTED HIM-- DON'T LISTEN TO
THEM, JON.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL ON THE INSIDE!
AND THERE IS NO SHAME BEING MORE
CATALOG THAN EDITORIAL.
THAT'S A FACT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE WRITER,
DIRECTOR, AND STAFFER A VERY
FUNNY NEW MOVIE "IN A WORLD"
LAKE BELL WILL BE HERE.
VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
BREAKING NEWS.
>> THE BIG CHILL BETWEEN THE
U.S. AND RUSSIA MAY BE HEADING
FOR THE DEEP FREEZE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS OFFICIALLY
CANCELED HIS ONE-ON-ONE MEETING
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
>> John: CANCELED?
WOW, THAT'S A BIG DIPLOMATIC
SLAP IN THE FACE, A DIP MOVE, IF
YOU WILL.
( LAUGHTER )
ALTHOUGH IF THE PRESIDENT REALLY
WANTED TO HURT PUTIN HE WOULD
HAVE SAID HE WAS COMING AND JUST
STOOD HIM UP.
TRUST ME, THAT HURTS A LOT MORE.
OR IF YOU WANTED TO BE MORE
PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE THE PRESIDENT
COULD HAVE SAID LET'S MEET
SOMEWHERE THAT'S NOT TECHNICALLY
IN RUSSIA LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
MOSCOW AIRPORT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW-- WE ALL KNOW
WHY THIS MEETING WAS CANCELED,
RIGHT.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA FORMALLY
CANCELED NEXT MONTH'S MEETING IN
MOSCOW WITH RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT
VLADIMIR PUTIN.
WHY?
>> MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN
RIGHTS, THAT CONTROVERSIAL LAW
THERE THAT BANS GAY
RELATIONSHIPS AND A LOT OF
CONCERN ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO
IMPACT THE OLYMPICS IN SOCHI.
>> John: OH, THAT'S RIGHT
BECAUSE RUSSIA WILL NOT ALLOW A
HINT OF HOMOSWULLITY IN AN EVENT
WHERE YOU EITHER WIN A
SKIN-TIGHT LEOTARD OR SPARKLY
TUXEDO FOR YOUR ICE BALLET.
COME ON, COME ON, NOW.
IS THERE NOTHING ELSE THAT LED
AMERICA TO THIS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS CANCELLING
HIS MEETING WITH RUSSIA'S
PRESIDENT PUTIN OVER TENSIONS
BECAUSEst N.S.A. LEAKER
EDWARD SNOWDEN.
>> John: YES, THAT IS CLEARLY
THE ONLY REASON.
IT'S-- IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA
TO PAD OUT WITH WHAT YOU REALLY
WANT TO SAY WITH SELF-RIGHTEOUS
HUMAN RIGHTS STUFF LIKE,
"KIMBERLY, WE NEED A BREAK.
I DON'T LIKE YOUR STANCE ON
CHINE AND TIBETAN MONKS AND YOUR
BOOBS ARE WEIRDING ME OUT."
IF WE WANT SNOWDEN BACK ALL WE
NEED TO DO IS CONVINCE VLADIMIR
PUTIN THAT SNOWDEN IS GAY.
THAT AWAY WAYHE'LLOB A PLANE
INTO U.S. CUSTODY FASTER THAN A
DEFINITELY NOT HOMOEROTIC TEAM
OF ELASTIC CLAD MEN
