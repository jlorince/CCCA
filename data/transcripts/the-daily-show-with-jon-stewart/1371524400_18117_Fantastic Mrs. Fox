COMEDY CENTRAL
>> John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
WELCOME.
I AM JOHN OLIVER, JON STEWART
STILL NOT HERE.
HE IS AT HOME RECOVERING THERE A
STATE-OF-THE-ART PROCEDURE IN
WHICH HE SWITCHED FACES WITH
NICHOLAS CAGE.
( LAUGHTER )
THEY TOOK HIS FACE OFF.
MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM "MAD MEN,"
LINDA CARDELLINI IS HERE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
BUT FIRST, FIRST TONIGHT, I AND
THE REST OF AMERICA WOKE UP THIS
MORNING IN THE WORST WAY
IMAGINABLE.
>> GOVERNOR, WELCOME BACK TO THE
CHANNEL.
>> THANK YOU.
I GET TO BE HERE THE ENTIRE
HOUR.
>> John: WELL, WELL, WELL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELL, WELL, WELL.
LOOK WHAT THE FOX DRAGGED IN
( LAUGHTER )
SARAH PALIN HAS BEEN HIRED BACK
BY FOX NEWS, AND SHE ONLY LEFT
FIVE MONTHS AGO.
SHE'S NOW EFFECTIVELY QUIT
QUITTING.
( LAUGHTER )
SHE CAN'T EVEN COMMIT TO BEING
UNCOMMITTED.
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S BE FAIR TO HER.
PEOPLE DO CHANGE.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
>> I AM DOING GREAT, WRITING A
BOOK, A BOOK ABOUT CHRISTMAS,
AND PUSHING BACK ON THE
POLITICALLY CORRECT WHO WOULD
TRY TO TAKE CHRIST OUT OF
CHRISTMAS.
DO NEW YORKERS FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
JUST A BUNCH OF LITTLE BABIES
WITH THANK GOODNESS YOU GOT THIS
NANNY.
YOU JUST PUT THE B.S. IN CBS.
WITH BENGHAZI, THE GOVERNMENT
LIED AND PEOPLE DIED.
GOVERNMENT LIED AND GOVERNMENT
SPIED.
>> John: OKAY, DR. SEUSS.
( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, THAT LITTLE RHYME IS
FROM ONE OF SARAH'S KIDS' BOOKS,
"ALL THE PLACES YOU'LL LEAVE."
I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO
BEGIN WITH HER.
I MEAN-- HOLD ON.
I THINK I'VE JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING.
( BLEEP ).
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS.
JUST BECAUSE I WALKED INTO A
SUPERMARKET DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE
TO BUY ANYTHING.
THIS IS BRINGS US TO OUR NEW
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SEGMENT.
"WAIT A SECOND.
WE CAN JUST IGNORE HER."
( LAUGHTER )
WE CAN DO THAT.
( CHEERS )
WE CAN ALL DO THAT.
THAT IS A POWER WE HAVE.
BECAUSE, YES, WE COULD SPEND THE
WHOLE SHOW JUXTAPOSING VIDEO
CLIPS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW SARAH
PALIN'S STRONGLY FELT
CONVICTIONS ARE NOTHING MORE
THAN SELF-CONTRADICTORY
NONSENSE.
OR WE CAN JUST IGNORE HER.
YES!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE CAN RESPOND TO HER OBVIOUS
TROLLING WITH A SERIES OF
INSULTING JOKES, AND MAYBE
TOGETHER ENJOY A BRIEF MOMENT OF
CATHARSIS, OR WE CAN JUST
( BLEEP ) IGNOG HER.
I PROMISE, AMERICA, IT WILL FEEL
SO GOOD.
IT WILL BE LIKE WE GIVE OUR
BRAINS AN ENEMA TOGETHER.
I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL BE EASY.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S A TEMPTRESS.
( LAUGHTER )
OH, SARAH, IF ONLY IT WAS AS
EASY FOR US TO QUIT YOU AS IT IS
FOR YOU TO
