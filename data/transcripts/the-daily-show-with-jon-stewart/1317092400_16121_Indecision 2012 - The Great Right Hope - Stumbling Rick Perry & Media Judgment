NO DISRESPECT.
AHEAD OF RICK PERRY, PERRY HAD
MOSTLY STUMBLED THROUGH THE
TWO PREVIOUS DEBATES YET
RETAINED HIS FRONTRUNNER
STATUS.
WOULD THE THIRD TIME BE THE
CHARM?
>> I THINK AMERICANS JUST
DON'T KNOW SOMETIMES WHICH
MITT ROMNEY THEY'RE DEALING
WITH.
IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT WAS
ON THE SIDE OF AGAINST THE
SECOND AMENDMENT QUALIFY HE
WAS FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
WAS IT BEFORE HE WAS BEFORE
THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS FROM THE
STANDPOINT OF HE WAS FOR
STANDING UP FOR ROE VERSUS
WADE BEFORE HE WAS AGAINST ROE
VERSUS WADE?
HE WAS FOR RACE TO THE TOP.
HE'S FOR OBAMA CARE AND NOW
HE'S AGAINST IT.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: MITT NAILED IT.
CAN'T BELIEVE MY ADVISORS TOLD
ME NOT TO GET HIGH BEFORE THIS
DEBATE.
I'M TELLING YOU.
I'M KILLING HIM.
HOLY (BEEP).
IF I'M ROMNEY, I DON'T EVEN
ANSWER.
I JUST CEDE MY TIME BACK TO
RICK PERRY.
"NO, NO, I CEDE BACK TO PERRY.
HE'S DOING GREAT.
KEEP GOING."
THE THIRD PERRY DEBATE WAS
EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST TWO.
PERRY DEMONSTRATING AN
INCREDIBLE UNLEARNING CURVE.
HEY, MAN, IT'S EARLY.
NO HARM.
NO FOUL.
>> RICK PERRY IS NOT PREPARED
FOR THE PRESSURE OF THE
PRESIDENTIAL STAGE.
>> YOU CAN REPLACE HIM WITH A
CARDBOARD CUT OUT AND NOT
NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE.
>> PERRY DID HORRIBLE AT THIS
DEBATE.
>> RICK PERRY SUCKED THE OTHER
NIGHT.
>> YOU CAN READ IT ANY OF
THOSE THREE WAYS.
PERRY REALLY DID THROW UP ALL
OVER HIMSELF AT THE DEBATE AT
A TIME WHEN HE NEEDED TO RAISE
HIS GAME.
>> Jon: EVERYTHING HUME SAYS
HAS GRAVITAS EVEN WHEN HE'S
SAYING, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE,
CHRIS, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A
LONG TIME.
REALLY IN MY ESTIMATION THE
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY
REALLY HAD DIARRHEA IN HIS OWN
HAIR.
HE REALLY LOOKED LIKE HE HELD
IT UP FOR THE CROWD IN TERMS
OF... LOOK, LOOK.
LOOK AT MY POOP PANTS.
THAT WAS AT A TIME WHEN I
THOUGHT THAT THE GOVERNOR
REALLY NEEDED TO JUST ANSWER
THE QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF
TAKING A DUMP IN HIS OWN
PANTS.
