ENJOYING A FROSTY ONE WITHGERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL.
>> A HUGE DEBATE AS TO WHETHERTHE BEER ANGELA MERKEL AND
PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE DRINKINGCONTAINED ALCOHOL.
ACCORDING TO AP, THE MAYOR OFTHAT LITTLE TOWN CONFIRMED BOTH
BEERS WERE ALCOHOL-FREE.
>> Jon: BULL (BLEEP)!
YES, GERMAN ALCOHOL-FREE BEER.
(LAUGHTER)
OR AS IT'S KNOWN HERE INAMERICA, MOON SHINE.
(LAUGHTER)
WE ONLY GIVE THEM THE KINDER OFBEER -- THE KIND OF BEER OUR
CHILDREN DRINK AT SCHOOL LUNCH!
IT ONLY HAS THE SAME ALCOHOLCONTENT AS YOUR JIM BEAM!
(LAUGHTER)
ENOUGH POINTLESS SPECULATION ONWHAT THEY WERE DRINKING.
GERMANY IS A KEY ALLY TO THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA AND ANGELA MERKEL --CRITICAL.
AND THERE'S A PICTURE OF THEMTALKING. NOW, WE COULD PUT IN
THE LEG WORK AND INVESTIGATE ANDREPORT ON WHAT THEY WERE
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT -- OR --
>> THIS PHOTO, TAKEN OF GERMANCHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, GETTING ALLTHE BUZZ.
>> THE PREIDENT AND ANEXPRESSIVE GERMAN CHANCELLOR.
>> ANGELA MERKEL APPEARING TOALMOST BURST INTO SONGS.
>> SHE HAS HER ARMS OUT LIKEWHAT'S GOING ON.
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S SAYINGSOMETHING TO HER THERE?
THIS DOLLAR THING, GOTTA GET THEEURO MOVING.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT'SHAPPENEING.
SHE'S SAYING, I WILL REIGN HELLDOWN UPON YOU!
AND OBAMA IS ALL -- DO I  LOOKSCARED.
AND THEN SHE'S ALL -- I TOLD YOUBEFORE, I WANTED TO SIT ON THAT
BENCH!
AND HE'S ALL LIKE, YOU SHOULD'VEGOTTEN HERE EARLIER.
YOU CAN'T REALLY GET A SENSE OFHOW THAT'S GOING FROM ONE IMAGE.
DOES MERKEL LOOK A LITTLEAGITATED, OBAMA?
YES, BUT THE NEXT IMAGE -- OH!
I SEE SHE REALLY -- THAT DOESLOOK BAD.
WELL, AS HARD AS IT IS TOBELIEVE THE SPECULATION OVER A
PICTURE OF ANGELA MERKEL HOLDINGHER ARMS OUT PALED IN COMPARISON
TO SPECULATION ABOUT OBAMA'SDISS OF THE IRAQI PRIME
MINISTER.
>> IT APPEARED THAT U.S.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
SNUBBED THE IRAQI PRIMEMINISTER.
>> SITTING NEXT TO HIM IS THEIRAQI PRIME MINISTER, SITS DOING
TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT.
THE PRESIDENT AT ONE MOMENTAPPEARS TO TURN HIS HEAD,
CONTINUES HIS CONVERSATION HE'SALREADY IN THE MIDSTS OF --
WELL, THEN 40 SECONDS PASS, THEPRESIDENT GETS UP TO LEAVE.
THE IRAQI PRIME MINISTERTOO LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.
HIS TRANSLATOR THROWS HIS HANDSIN THE AIR, APPEARS HE'S PRETTY
FRUSTRATED AND EVERYBODY WALKSOFF.
>> Jon: WELL, I GUESS MYPROM-POSAL WILL HAVE TO WAIT.
I HAD EVERYTHING OUT.
THE PLANE WAS GOING TO FLY OVER.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE NO(BLEEP) IDEA IF THIS WAS A SNUB
OR OBAMA WAS UNAWARE THEIRAQI PRIME MINISTER JUST SAT
DOWN, OR WAS THE IRAQI PRIMEMINISTER WANTING TO TALK TO
THE HEAD OF THE IMF, OR IF THATWAS JUST HIS PIGEON FEEDING
BENCH AND THINKING, IT'S TIME,IT'S SUPPOSED TO FEED BEEKY
McGILLICUTTY.
SO, AGAIN, THE NEWS MEDIA CANINVESTIGATE OR --
>> THE PRESIDENT LITERALLYTURNED HIS BACK ON THE PRIME
MINISTER.
>> WAS IT A SNUB, AN OVERSIGHT?
>> AN AWKWARD MOMENT.
>> THIS WAS CLEARLY A SNUB.
>> THE SNUB HEARD THROUGHOUT THEWORLD.
>>IT WAS AWKWARD, BUT WAS IT ASNUB?
>> IT WAS MORE HASHTAG AWKWARD--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT'S MORE, LIKE, ONTHE AWK SCALE BETWEEN, LIKE,
TOTES NOT AWK AND O.M.F.G.AWK--POCALYPSE!
I'D SAY IT RATES A SOLIDAWK-A-DOODLE-DOO!
NOW, BEFORE WE ALL RUSH TOJUDGEMENT, MAYBE IT WASN'T A
SNUB AT ALL.
MAYBE HE WAS NEGGING THE PRIMEMINSTER AS AN ELABORATE GAME
OF SEDUCTION.
ABADI'S COUNTRY IS BEING TORNAPART.
HE'S FEELING INSECURE, A.K.A.THE PERFECT TIME TO SCORE.
IT'S ALL IN MY BOOK, GETTINGYOUR GLOBE WET: JON STEWART'S
GUIDE TO SEDUCING EMOTIONALLYVULNERABLE WORLD LEADERS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
BUT ALSO, MAYBE, JUST MAYBE THEPRESIDENT JUST ACTUALLY DIDN'T
SEE HIM.
>> IT'S FUN TO LOOK AT  FOOTAGEAND EVALUATE WHAT'S GOING ON.
BUT I THINK THIS IS CASE, IT'SMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
>> Jon: WELL, THERE YOU GO.
SOME ACTUAL INFORMATION FROM ANACTUAL WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL WITH
BONA FIDE KNOWLEDGE TO HAVE REALSITUATION.
THE SNUB WAS A NON-EVENT.
UNLESS --
>> I DON'T THINK OBAMA SAW HIM,BUT IT'S A METAPHOR FOR WHAT'S
GOING ON.
>> Jon: YES, A METAPHOR FORWHAT'S GOING ON.
SOMEONE IS SO ENGROSSED BYWHAT'S IN THEIR IMMEDIATE VISUAL
FIELD THEY'RE NOT PAYINGATTENTION TO THE ACTUAL ISSUES.
THAT IS A METAPHOR FOR WHAT'SGOING ON IN THE NEWS.
WAS IT SNUB, AN HONEST MISTAKE?
I DON'T WANNA GIVE THISIMPORTANT STORY SHORT TRIP.
WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR "THEDAILY SHOW" SOCIAL CUE ROUND
TABLE.
