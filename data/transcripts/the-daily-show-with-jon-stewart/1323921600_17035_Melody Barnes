>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS PRESENT
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF THE
DOMESTIC POLICY COUNCIL.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
MELODY BARNES.
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR OF THE
DOMESTIC POLICY OFFICE FOR THE
PRESIDENT, BUT YOU ARE LEAVING?
>> YES, I AM.
>> Jon: WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
>> AT THE END OF THE YEAR.
>> Jon: SO IN TWO WEEKS?
>> YES.
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU HOW I
KNOW THAT.
LOOK AT HOW HAPPY YOU ARE.
LOOK AT YOUR SMILING, RADIANT,
EXCITED FACE.
WE HAD AUSTAN GOOLSBEE ON TWO
WEEKS BEFORE HE LEFT.
HE HAD THAT SAME CREEPY GIDDY
EXCITEMENT.
>> IT'S A MIXTURE OF EMOTIONS.
>> Jon:, NO NO, IT DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A MIXTURE.
THAT AIN'T A MIXTURE.
THAT'S PURE JOY.
IF YOU COULD BOTTLE WHATEVER IT
IS AT THAT HIGH-POWERED ELATION
THAT'S THAT COMES FROM LEAVING
THE WHITE HOUSE, I THINK THE
DEFICIT COULD BE SOLVED.
>> THAT'S MY NEXT MOVE.
>> Jon: NOW, YOU WERE... WHAT
IS IN THE PURVIEW OF THE
DIRECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC POLICY
COUNCIL?
WHAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF THING
YOU'RE WORKING ON?
>> SURE.
SURE.
THAT'S BASICALLY THE QUESTION MY
PARENTS ASKED WHEN THE PRESIDENT
TAGGED ME FOR THIS JOB.
>> Jon: DO THEY HAVE A SHOW?
>> NO.
IT'S A RANGE OF THINGS.
THERE ARE EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH
CARE TO ENERGY TO EDUCATION TO
IMMIGRATION TO CIVIL RIGHTS,
NATIONAL SERVICE.
IT IS A VERY, VERY BROAD
PORTFOLIO.
>> Jon: AS YOU WALK OUT TO,
YOU MOST... THING YOU'RE
PROUDEST OF WALKING OUT THE
DOOR?
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS,
BUT THE WORK WE'VE DONE AROUND
EDUCATION HAS BEEN A GAME
CHANGER.
IT REALLY HAS.
>> Jon: YOU'VE TURNED THE
COUNTRY AROUND.
WAIT A MINUTE.
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE ARE TURNING SCHOOLS AROUND.
AN WE HAVE SET A COURSE ON
EDUCATION REFORM LIKE NO OTHER.
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED
EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND HE'S
DONE VERY COURAGEOUS THINGS.
WE PASSED A HIGHER EDUCATION
BILL AT THE SAME TIME THEY
PASSED THE HEALTH CARE BILL THAT
IS THE BIGGEST HIGHER EDUCATION
REFORM SINCE THE G.I. BILL.
IT IS REALLY CHANGING LIVES.
IT'S HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR
DEBT AND THEIR LOANS.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
THAT WAS A BIG DEAL.
WHAT ABOUT BEFORE YOU GET TO I
GUESS COLLEGE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THE TROUBLE WE HAVE READING
AND THE WRITING AND THE...
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT.
>> Jon: WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
THAT?
>> WE'RE DOING THAT TOO.
>> Jon: THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT
I HEAR FROM TEACHERS, AND BY
TEACHERS I MEAN MY MOM...
>> MY MOM'S A TEACHER, TOO.
>> A, WHY DID YOU WEAR THAT
SHIRT, AND, B, THEY'RE TEACHING
TO THE TEST.
THIS IDEA THAT THIS RACE TO THE
TOP, NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, THESE
BENCHMARKS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN
FROM WASHINGTON HAVE CAUSED
SCHOOLS TO FOCUS ENTIRELY ON
WHATEVER... MEETING WHATEVER
BENCHMARK OR REQUIREMENT THEY
NEED TO GET FUNDING, AND IT HAS
REMOVED FROM EDUCATION THE... I
GUESS YOU'D CALL IT THE
EDUCATING.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING
MY MOM TALKS ABOUT.
SHE WAS A TEACHER FOR A VERY
LONG TIME.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TURN
AROUND.
NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND HAD THAT
COOKIE CUTTER, ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL
APPROACH TO EDUCATION.
WHAT WE'VE DONE THROUGH RACE TO
THE TOP, AND MOST RECENTLY
BECAUSE CONGRESS WOULDN'T MOVE
ON REAUTHORIZING THE NO CHILD
LEFT BEHIND ACT AND TURNING IT
AROUND, WE HAVE USED OUR
FLEXIBILITY AND THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH TO SAY, YOU HAVE GOT TO
RELEASE, IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT
IN PLACE SMART REFORMS FROM
THOSE MANDATES FROM NO CHILD
LEFT BEHIND, SO THERE IS MORE
FLEXIBILITY.
THERE'S MORE INNOVATION.
THERE'S MORE CREATIVITY THAT
TEACHERS CAN, IN FACT, TEACH
>> Jon: SO YOUR FEEDBACK IS
THAT RACE TO THE TOP HAS
INTENSIFIED THE ISSUE, NOT
ALLEVIATED IT.
I GUESS THE PEOPLE I TALK TO
DON'T WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> NOW, NOW, NOW.
NO, YOU LOOK AT IT.
WE'VE BROUGHT... THE STATES THAT
HAVE WON RACE TO THE TOP GRANT,
WHICH BROUGHT THE TEACHERS
AROUND THE TABLE WITH
PRINCIPALS, WITH PARENTS, WITH
COMMUNITY LEADERS TO FOCUS ON
PLANS TO HELP REFORM EDUCATION,
TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE NEED
TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE
CAREER AND COLLEGE READY WHEN
THEY FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HOW DO
THEY DO THAT IN A WAY THAT'S GOT
HIGH STANDARDS LIKE COLLEGE AND
CAREER READY STANDARDS, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, LET STATES, LET
DISTRICTS USE THE FLEXIBILITY,
USE WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE
CLASSROOM AND ABOUT THE STUDENT
SO THEY CAN MEET THOSE
STANDARDS.
>> DO YOU THINK ULTIMATELY WE
WILL FIND OURSELVES CHANGING OUR
ENTIRE MODEL OF EDUCATION, YOU
KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND WITH
EDUCATION THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE
THE ONES THAT MAKE THE ENORMOUS
DIFFERENCE AND THE MORE THAT
YOU'RE ABLE TO EMPOWER, A GREAT
TEACHER, A GREAT PRINCIPAL, A
GREAT SUPERINTENDENT CAN MAKE
ENORMOUS DIFFERENCES.
HOW DO WE EMPOWER THE
INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THE
AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO
MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND NOT TIE
THEM TO ARBITRARY OBJECTIVE
REALITIES OR GOALS.
>> RIGHT.
WELL, I THINK YOU DO WANT TO
MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT STUDENTS
ARE COLLEGE AND CAREER READY.
PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE
HAD IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT
STATES HAVE USED ALL KINDS OF
STANDARDS AND, IN FACT, LOWERED
THEIR STANDARDS SO THEY CAN MEET
FEDERAL MANDATES.
THAT'S GOOD FOR THE STATES.
THAT'S HORRIBLE FOR THE KIDS.
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE
STANDARDS ARE HIGH, BUT AT THE
SAME TIME, WE DO WANT TO EMPOWER
TEACHERS.
AND WE ALSO WANT TO BRING
PARENTS IN.
A TEACHER, A GREAT LEADER
CHANGES A CHILD'S LIFE
SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT WE KNOW THE
PERSON THAT DOES THAT WITH
GREATEST AUTHORITY IS THE
PARENT.
SO WHAT WE'VE ENCOURAGED, WHAT
WE'VE PUT BEFORE CONGRESS IS A
PLAN THAT SAYS, WE'VE GOT TO
BRING MORE PARENTS IN.
WE'VE GOT GIVE TEACHERS GREATER
FLEXIBILITY.
GIVE THEM MORE ACCESS TO DATA
AND INFORMATION SO THAT IN REAL
TIME THEY CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO
TEACH KIDS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW MY IDEA?
>> NO.
>> Jon: SCHOOL IS OPEN 24
HOURS A DAY.
THERE ARE THESE BUILDINGS WITH
ALL THESE ROOMS FROM 3:00 ON.
WE RENT THEM OUT, I DON'T KNOW,
BROTHEL.
I DON'T KNOW, WHATEVER.
YOU GET MONEY, YOU CAN DO ALL
KINDS OF STUFF.
>> NOT THE BROTHEL PLAN.
>> Jon: PROBABLY NOT.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FIVE
MINUTES?
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PAYROLL
TAXMENT BY THE WAY,
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR UPCOMING
LEAVE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: MELODY BARNES.
WE'LL TALK MORE ON THE INTERNET.
