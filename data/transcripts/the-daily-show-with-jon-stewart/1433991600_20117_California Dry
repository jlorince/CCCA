I'M JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT.
WE'VE GOT YOUR TREMENDOUSCOMIC, COLIN QUINN WILL JOIN US
TONIGHT.
HE'S GOING TO SIT RIGHT THERE,I' M GONNA TALK TO HIM!
FIRST, AS YOU KNOW, CALIFORNIAHAS GONE THROUGH HISTORIC
UNPRECEDENTED DRY SPELL.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ORIGINALMOVIE IDEAS.
BOOM!
TAKE THAT "JURASSIC WORLD."
WHAT IF THEY BUILT ANOTHERDINOSAUR THEME PARK, BUT THIS
TIME THINGS ALSO WENT HORRIBLYWRONG?
ALL RIGHT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THECATASTROPHIC FOUR-YEAR DROUGHT.
CALIFORNIA'S RESERVOIRS AREEMPTY.
THE SNOWPACK IS GONE.
WHAT LITTLE WATER IS CONTROLLEDBY A RUTHLESS, DISFIGURED
WARLORD, DOLING OUT PRECIOUSMOISTURE FROM HIS MOUNTAIN
STRONGHOLD.
WOW.
[LAUGHTER]
JERRY BROWN HAS NOT AGED WELL.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M KIDDING OF COURSE.
JERRY BROWN HASN'T AGED AT ALL.
HE'S STILL GOOD OL' GOVERNORMOONBEAM, PUTTING THE WATER
SCARCITY ISSUE IN TERMS THATANYONE ON 'SHROOMS CAN
UNDERSTAND.
>> SOME PEOPLE CALL WATER ARIGHT, SOME PEOPLE CALL WATER
THE ESSENCE OF LIFE.
WATER IS A BAPTISM.
WATER IS A POETRY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YEAH, WATER IS POETRY.
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE BLUE,CAN I WASH MY [BLEEP] CAR OR
NOT?
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTEDMANDATORY WATER RESTRICTIONS.
WE WEREN'T THAT HAPPY WITH THAT.
YOU GUYS ARE?
I'M OKAY.
ANYWAY, THEY'VE INSTITUTEDMANDATORY WATER RESTRICTIONS.
THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO GETOVERALL WATER USAGE DOWN 25%.
OBVIOUSLY NOT INCLUDINGAGRICULTURE, WHICH IS MOST OF
THE WATER USAGE, BUT RIGHT NOWUSAGE IS ONLY DOWN 9%.
SO IT IS TIME TO GET REAL.
>> THE $623 MILLION WATERRECYCLING PLANT TURNS TREATED
SEWAGE FROM THE SANITATIONDEPARTMENT NEXT DOOR INTO
DRINKABLE WATER.
THE WATER THAT COMES OUT ISCLEANER THAN MOST TAP WATER IN
THE COUNTRY.
IT'S CALLED INDIRECT POTABLEREUSE, BUT IT'S MORE
DESCRIPTIVELY KNOWN ASTOILET-TO-TAP.
>> Jon: IT'S KNOWN ASTOILET-TO-TAP, BUT THERE ARE
STEPS IN BETWEEN.
YOU'RE NOT JUST STICKING ADRINK' STRAW UP SOMEBODY'S ASS.
JESUS, THERE'S A PROCESS IT GOESTHROUGH.
BUT OVIOUSLY WITH THE NAMETOILET-TO-TAP, PEOPLE TEND TO
REACT TO THIS GODSEND OF ADROUGHT SOLUTION LIKE THIS.
>> THAT'S DIRTY, THAT'S NASTY.
>> THAT'S DISGUSTING.
>> THE YUCK FACTOR.
>> MAJOR ICKY, GROSS FACTOR.
>> I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOODIDEA, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE
HOW IT'S DONE.
IT'S JUST THE GRAPHIC IN MY MINDOF WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE TOILET
IS SCARY.
>> Jon: GAIL?
GAIL, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN THETOILET?
THE MEMORY IS SEARED IN MY MIND.
IT WAS 1997 IN THE RENO GOLDENCORRAL.
MY GOD, IT JUST KEPT COMING. ITJUST KEPT COMING.
THE HORROR.
SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE I NEVERLEFT THERE.
CALIFORNIANS, IF YOU WANT PEOPLETO BUY SOMETHING, DON'T TELL
THEM WHAT IT REALLY IS.
SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
LIKE PORN! YOU THINK THE VALLEYWOULD HAVE PORN IF PORN
WERE RENAMED SAD ROMANIANS[BLEEP] FOR MONEY?
NO, THEY WOULDN'T.
WHILE SOME COMMUNITIES ARE USINGTECHNOLOGY TO RECYCLE WATER,
OTHERS ARE HARNESSING A FAR MORERENEWABLE RESOURCE.
SNITCHING.
>> LASSER COUNTY WATER AGENCYLAUNCHED AN APP FOR PEOPLE TO
REPORT WATER WASTERS.
>> IT WILL INCLUDE THE GPSLOCATIONS SO THEN WE CAN FOLLOW
UP.
>> CHECK OUT THIS PICTURE.
A CUSTOMER USED THE WATER APP TOREPORT A WATER WASTER.
SAME STORY HERE.
>> Jon: YEAH!
THAT WILL TEACH THOSE MOTHER[BLEEP]ERS TO HAVE IVY!
