>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
HIGH NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT,
PEOPLE.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, DIANE RAVITCH
WILL BE HERE.
AUTHOR OF A BOOK ON THE AMERICAN
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, WHICH AS YOU
KNOW, IS SECOND TO MANY.
( LAUGHTER )
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN WISCONSIN
WITH THE ONGOING COVERAGE OF
CRISIS IN THE DAIRYLAND.
♪ ♪ ♪
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE WELCOME.
( LAUGHTER )
IN HIS BATTLE TO BALANCE
WISCONSIN'S BUDGET, GOVERNOR
SCOTT WALKER HAS FINALLY PUT HIS
PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE.
HE IS, IN ADDITION TO STRIPPING
TEACHERS AND PUBLIC WORKERS OF
MOST OF THEIR COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING RIGHTS, CUTTING $800
MILLION FROM THE WISCONSIN
PUBLIC SCHOOL'S BUDGET OVER THE
NEXT TWO YEARS.
AS WELL AS RESTRICTING LOCAL
MUNICIPALITIES THE ABILITY TO
RAISE PROPERTY TAXES TO MAKE UP
FOR ANY SHORTFALLS.
IN ESSENCE, HE HAS PUT PUBLIC
SECTOR UNIONS ON NOTICE, AND
PARTICULARLY TEACHERS, THAT THE
GRAVY TRAIN IS OVER.
( LAUGHTER )
EVEN IF IT THE GRAVY IS ACTUALLY
LUNCH ROOM CAFETERIA-GRADE
GRAVY-LIKE REHYDRATED CHIPS.
>> WE CAN NO LONGER LIVE IN A
SOCIETY WHERE THE PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES ARE THE HAVES AND THE
TAXPAYERS WHO FOOT THE BILLS ARE
THE HAVE-NOTS.
>> IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES
WE'VE ALL GOT TO BE IN IT
TOGETHER.
>> Jon: WE ALL ARE IN IT
TOGETHER.
ALL OF US HAVE TO SACRIFICE--
TEACHERS, TEACHERS' ASSISTANTS,
STUDENT TEACHERS.
( LAUGHTER )
RETIRED TEACHERS.
SCHOOL JANITORS.
EVERYBODY HAS TO SACRIFICE.
WHY TEACHERS?
WELL, AS REPUBLICANS AND THEIR
KIN IN THE MEDIA KNOW, YOU GOT
TO FOLLOW THE MONEY.
>> THE AVERAGE TEACHERS' SALARY
IS MUCH GREATER THAN AVERAGE
PRIVATE SECTOR SALARY.
>> SALARY, $51,000 IN WIS CONNIN
BENEFITS $38,000 PER YEAR.
THAT COMES TO A WHOPPING 89,000
BUCKS MORE THAN THEIR PRIVATE
SECTOR COUNTER-PART PURPOSE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A $90,000
NINE MONTHS WORTH OF WORK
PACKAGE WHICH SOUNDS PRETTY DARN
GOOD TO THE 14 MILLION PEOPLE
OUT OF WORK.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT DOES SOUND GREAT TO SOMEONE
WITHOUT A JOB.
( LAUGHTER )
AND DID YOU KNOW-- YOU'RE NOT
EVEN GOING TO BELIEVE THIS--
SOME OF THESE FAT CAT PUBLIC
SCHOOL KIDS ARE GETTING A HOT
BREAKFAST FREE EVERY MORNING.
( LAUGHTER )
I'LL BET
