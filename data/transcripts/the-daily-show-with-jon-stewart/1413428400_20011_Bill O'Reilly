WHITE PRIVILEGE.>> THE RESIDUE OF THAT.
IT'S, IT'S, ALL RIGHT, IF YOUWANT TO SAY IT'S
WHITE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE WHITESDIDN'T HAVE IT AS BAD AS BLACKS.
>> Jon: I'M NOT SAYING IT'S ANEXCUSE. I'M SAYING IT EXISTS.
>> FINE.>> Jon: THAT'S IT!

GARDEN CITY.
IT'S ALL RELATIVE, YES.
IT'S HARDER IF YOU'RE A GHETTOKID.
YES, BUT CAN YOU DO IT?
YES.
>> Jon: YES, YOU CAN.
SO WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ISWHY SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT?
WHY IS IT THAT WHITE PEOPLE GETSO DEFENSIVE ABOUT THIS?
I'M NOT SAYING THAT LIFE ISN'THARD.
MIDDLE CLASS WHITE GUYS THAT AREWORKING HARD TO DO WHAT THEY CAN
AND THEY LOOK AND THEY GO I'MNOT GETTING ANY PRIVILEGE.
AT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ISA GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE
BROUGHT HERE.
THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO IMMIGRATEHERE TO GET THAT BETTER LIFE.
AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OURCOUNTRIES HAD A PROBLEM WITH
THAT, AND WE CAN MOVE --
>> PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE THATWHO ARE FAIR MINDED.
BUT YOU DON'T THEN TAKE THAT ANDTHEN CONDEMN THE MODERN SOCIETY.
