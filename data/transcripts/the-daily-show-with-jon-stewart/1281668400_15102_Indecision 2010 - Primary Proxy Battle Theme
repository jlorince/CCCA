COMEDY CENTRAL
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART,
TONIGHT'S GUEST, THE BAND
ARCADE FIRE.
A CANADIAN BAND FROM
MONTREAL.
SO BELIEVE ME, WE WILL BE
WATCHING THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: DROPPING ANY OF THEM
ANCHOR BABIES, BELIEVE ME.
COME HERE FROM CANADA, DROP
AN ANCHOR BABY, OH, I GUESS
WE HAVE TO STAY NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT WAS ODD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT WAS A SQUEAL
FROM AN ANCHOR BABIES.
TONIGHT WE BEGIN WITH AN
INDECISION 2010 UPDATE AND
RESULTS FROM TUESDAY NIGHT'S
EXCITING PRIMARY.
SO EXCITED WE NEEDED A DAY
TO COOL DOWN SO WE COULD
REPORT IT DISPASSIONATELY.
SO PRIMARIES IN CONNECTICUT,
COLORADO AND GEORGIA.
THE SMART STATES, THE PRETTY
STATE AND GEORGIA.
WHAT NARRATIVE WOULD EMERGE.
AS YOU KNOW THE LAST FEW
PRIMARYS HAD VERY CLEAR
THEMES.
A LOT OF FIRE FROM ANGRY
VOTERS COULD BE SHUTTING
DOWN A NUMBER OF INCUMBENTS.
>> ANGRY VOTERS AND
FRUSTRATED VOTERS.
>> ANGRY VOTERS.
>> WOMEN WIN BIG.
>> YOU MIGHT SAY IT WAS
LADY'S NIGHT.
>> THE ANTI-INCUMBENT MOVE.
NO OFFICIAL COULD BE
CONSIDERED SAFE.
>> MANY BELIEVE SHE WILL
STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IT.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD!
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
BLANCHE LINCOLN.
NOW OF COURSE, IN THOSE
PRIMARIES 98.5% OF INCUMBENTS
WON THEIR PRIMARIES AND 50%,
57% OF THE LADIES NIGHT
PRIMARIES WERE MEN.
JUST BECAUSE THE NARRATIVE
TURNS OUT TO BE UTTER
[BLEEP] DOESN'T MEAN WE
WON'T GET ANOTHER ONE FOR
THIS PRIMARY.
SO WHAT WAS IT THIS TUESDAY
NIGHT.
>> MANY HIGH PROFILE
ENDORSEMENTS ACTUALLY STOLE
THE SPOTLIGHT FROM THE
CANDIDATES THEMSELVES.
>> KAREN HANDEL WAS PACKED
BY SARAH PALIN.
>> FORMER CONGRESSMAN NATHAN
DEAL BACKED BY HUCKABEE AND
GINGRICH.
>> BENEFITS ROAN OF A.
>> OBAMA VERSUS CLINTON IS
THAT WHAT THIS RACE IS
BOILING DOWN TO, I WON'T GO
THERE, I WON'T GO THERE.
>> DON'T GO THERE.
RSVPRATOLFMO.
NAMBLA, DON'T KNOW.
SO THIS MONTH'S PRIMARY IS A
PROXY BATTLE THEME.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK IN
COLORADO, THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN
STATE.
BARACK OBAMA ENDORSED
MICHAEL BENNET, WON THE
SENATE PRIMARY, DEFEATING
BILL CLINTON, ENDORSED
ANDREW ROMANOFF.
DOWN GOES CLINTON.
I HOPE BENNET GAVE ALL DUE
PRAISE TO OBAMA.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE
PRIMARY VOTERS IN COLORADO
CARE AT ALL WHO ENDORSED
WHICH CANDIDATE.
>> YOU DON'T THINK THAT THAT
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT?
I MEAN COME ON, THAT'S WHAT
COLORADO WON THE NATIONAL
SCENE.
>> Jon: NOT TO BE PARTICULAR,
BUT I BELIEVE IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN THE PIKE'S PEAK GOLD
RUSH IN 1861 THAT ORIGINALLY
PUT COLORADO ON THE NATIONAL
SCENE LEADING A MERE 16
YEARS LATER TO THEIR
STATEHOOD RATIFICATION THEN
TRAGICALLY A 50 FOOT WOMAN
TAPPED ONE OF THEIR
MOUNTAINS.
(LAUGHTER)
IN THE ENSUING BEER-VALANCHE
THOUSANDS WERE KILLED.
WHAT HAPPENED IN GORGE
AR -- DORGE GA, KAREN HANDEL
AND NATHAN DEAL.
IN THIS TIME OF
ANTI-INCUMBENT ANGRY PROXY
LADIES NIGHT FERVOUR I THINK
WE KNOW HOW THIS ONE TURNS
OUT.
>> FORMER CONGRESSMAN NATHAN
DEAL DEFEATED FORMER GEORGIA
SECRETARY OF STATE KAREN
HANDEL.
[BLEEP].
>> Jon: I GUESS HANDEL'S
MESSIAH TURNED OUT TO BE A
DEAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
THE HANDEL... I'VE GOT
NOTHING ON THIS ONE.
HOW DID SARAH PALIN LOSE A
PROXY WAR.
SHE IS A GRIZZLY BEAR!
WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN GEORGIA
THAT CAN KICK A GRAZLY'S
BEAR'S ASS.
>> IN THE FIRST CAMPAIGN
KAREN HANDEL SUPPORTED GAY
PARTNER BENEFITS AND GAY
ADOPTION.
>> Jon: OH, THE GAY MONSTER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT IS WHAT BEATS
THE GRIDSLY BEAR.
NOW WHAT ABOUT THE
CONNECTICUT REPUBLICAN
SENATORIAL PRIMARY WHERE THE
PROXY WAR WAS BETWEEN THE
FREE MARKET REPRESENTED BY
PETER SCHIFF AND BEYOND
THUNDER DOME REPRESENTED BY
FORMER WORLD WRESTLING
ENTERTAINMENT C.E.O. LINDA
McMAHON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BY THE WAY, HOW DOES
A LADY CHUGGING A BEER AND
GETTING IN A BEAT DOWN WITH
STEVE AUSTEN NOT GET A SARAH
PALIN MAMA GRIZZLY
DESIGNATIONMENT WHAT DOES A
LADY GOT TO DO, KILL A MAN
WITH A SPORK.
COME ON.
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING
ABOUT McMAHON'S WIN WAS HER
ABILITY TO OVERCOME FOOTAGE
FROM HER ENTIRE LIBERAL
ADULT CAREER.
>> LINDA MAMA HON HAS KICKED
REPUBLICANS FOR YEARS.
>> THE GROUP CALLED MOTHERS
OPPOSING McMAHON WOULD MAKE
A NONWRESTLING FAN OF ANY
PARTY CRINGE.
>> THE ONE THAT STRUCK ME
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER ENTERING
THE RING AS THE CROWD CHANTS
SLUT, SLUT, SLUT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OH, THAT OLD
QUESTION.
WAIT A MINUTE, THEY TOOK
THAT FROM OUR SHOW.
SENATOR HARRY REID, SENATOR.
>> SLUT, SLUT, SLUT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: TO BE FAIR, TO BE
FAIR TO OUR AUDIENCE HARRY
REID WILL [BLEEP] TO MOVE.
LINDA MAMA HON WASN'T
ENDORSED BY OBAMA, CLINTON
OR PALIN.
SHE IS BREAKING THE SEEM.
I NEED A SEAM OR I CAN'T
FOLLOW THIS CRAP.
I HAVE TO BE HONESTMENT I'M
FREQUENT FREAKING OUT.
CHUCK DODD, I GAVE YOU A
BEARD.
>> THE ONE THING WE LEARNED
IS THAT THE CANDIDATES THAT
GOT THE MOST VOTES WON THEIR
PRIMARIES LAST NIGHT THAT
WAS TRUE.
MY POINT IS THAT THAT IS
LIKE THERE WAS NO, THAT IS
BASICALLY THERE WAS NO BIG
THEME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHY DO WE KEEP
PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU
PEOPLE!
WHY DO I ALWAYS, ALWAYS FALL
FOR IT.
I LEAN IN, WHAT DO I GET
