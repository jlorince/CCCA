HOME TO THE LEADER OF THE FREEWORLD. AND AS SUCH,
THE ULTIMATE IMPENETRABLEFORTRESS OF SECURITY -- OR NOT.
>> A FRIGHTENING SECURITY BREACHAT THE WHITE HOUSE.
42-YEAR-OLD OMAR GONZALEZ OFTEXAS JUMPED THE FENCE LAST
NIGHT AT 7:20 P.M.
HE MADE IT ALL THE WAY UP THENORTH LAWN.
HE WASN'T STOPPED UNTL HEPASSED THROUGH THE THRESHOLD OF
THE WHITE HOUSE DOORS.
>> WOW.
WELL IT'S A GOOD THING WE DON'TTREAT WHITE HOUSE INTRUDERS THE
WAY WE TREAT CUBAN REFUGEES.BECAUSE THEN, ONCE THAT GUY
REACHED THE HOUSE, PUT HISFOOT ON THE GROUND, HE
WOULD THEN AUTOMATICALLY BECOMEPRESIDENT.
THIS GUY MUST BE SOME KIND OFGENIUS CAT BURGLAR NINJA TO GET
THROUGH THE HOUSE'SMANY LAYERS OF DEFENSES.
>> GONZALES ENTERED THE UNLOCKEDFRONT DOOR OF THE FIRST
FAMILY'S RESIDENCE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: OR HE COULD BE FAST.
THEY LEAVE THE DOOR OF THE MOSTSECURE HOME IN THE COUNTRY --
UNLOCKED.
I GUESS PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHTIT WAS TOO DORKY TO CARRY THE
KEY AROUND.
IS THAT THE PROBLEM?
(LAUGHTER)WHAT WAS THE SECRET SERVICE
DOING?
>> THE INCIDENT HAPPENED JUSTFOUR MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST
FAMILY HAD LEFT THE WHITE HOUSEGROUNDS FOR THE WEEKEND.
FORMER SECRET SERVICE SPECIALAGENT SAYS IT'S POSSIBLE THE
BREECH HAPPENED BECAUSERESOURCES WERE FOCUSED ON THE
PRESIDENT'S DEPARTURE.
>> Jon: WELL THAT MAKES SENSE.
IF THEY ALL STAY AT THEIR POSTS,WHO'S GOING TO WAVE GOODBYE TO
THE PRESIDENT AS HE FLIES OFF INHIS HELICOPTER?
AND WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT LOOKEDBACK AND NOBODY WAS WAVING?
