>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT AN HISTORIAN OF
EDUCATION, A PROFESSOR AT N.Y.U.

CALLED, THE DEATH AND LIFE OF
THE GREAT AMERICAN SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM, DIANE RAVITCH.

♪ ♪ ♪
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: "THE DEATH ASK LIFE OF
THE GREAT AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM
HOW TESTING AND CHOICE ARE
UNDERMINING EDUCATION."
NOW YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME, BUT
I BELIEVE IF I'M CORRECT-- AND I
THINK I AM IT'S CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM IS TESTING AND CHOICE ARE
SAVING THE GREAT AMERICAN SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
SO I-- I THINK THE PREMISE OF
YOUR BOOK IS PROBABLY WRONG.
YOU PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE ALL
THAT BACK, DON'T YOU?
GO AHEAD.
>> WELL, LET ME ASK YOUR STUDIO
AUDIENCE.
HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE TESTING?
( BOOING )
WELL, THAT'S HALF THE ARGUMENT
RIGHT THERE.
>> Jon: I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE
WAY IT GOES.
( LAUGHTER )
SO WHY IS-- IN YOUR MIND, SO
THIS IS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND,
RACE TO THE TOP, THESE ARE THE
THINGS THAT ARE DAMAGING OUR
ABILITIES IN SCHOOLS?
IS THAT--
>> YEAH.
BASICALLY, WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE
NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND-- WHICH HAS
NOW BEEN AROUND FOR ALMOST 10
YEARS-- IS TOOLS HAVE BEEN
TURNED INTO TESTING FACTORIES
AND THERE'S LESS TIME FOR THE
ARTS.
WE HAVE SCHOOLS CUTTING THE ARTS
COMPLETELY.
LESS TIME FOR SCIENCE.
LESS TIME FOR HISTORY.
FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION, FOR
CIVICS.
ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE SCHOOL
INTERESTING --
>> YOU ALMOST SAID FUN.
>> NO I STUMBLED ON FUN, IT'S
TRUE.
KIDS HAVE TO HAVE A REASON TO
WANT TO COME TO SCHOOL.
I'VE NEVER MET ANY CHILD WHO
SAID, "I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO
SCHOOL FOR TEST PREP?"
>> Jon: THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO
HAVE IT AT SOME LEVEL.
NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND CERTAINLY
AROSE OUT OF A NEED TO FIX
SCHOOLS.
IT'S NO AS THOUGH IN THE 90s
SCHOOLS WERE GREAT.
SO WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT STEP,
OR IS IT COMPLICATED?
>> WE COULD LOOK, FOR INSTANCE,
AT FINLAND.
THEY'RE THE NUMBER ONE NATION IN
THE WORLD ON THE INTERNATIONAL
TEST.
THEY NEVER GIVE STANDARDIZED
TESTS AT ALL.
THEY FOCUS ON HAVING REALLY
TERRIFIC TEACHERS.
THEY PREPARE THEM WELL.
THEY GIVE THEM LOTS OF SUPPORT
AND THEN THE TEACHERS MAKE UP
THE TESTS AND THEY USE THE TESTS
TO SAY WHICH CHILDREN NEED HELP.
>> Jon: EVEN CRITICS, PEOPLE
THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS "WAITING
FOR SUPERMAN" THEY POINT TO
FINLAND AS WELL.
EVERYBODY POINTS TO FINLAND.
>> BUT FINLAND IS NOT
PRIVATIZING THEIR SCHOOLS.
>> Jon: VERY STRONG TEACHERS
UNION?
>> 100% TEACHER UNIONIZED.
FINLAND IS AN EXAMPLE OF A
COUNTRY THAT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL.
THE POVERTY RATE IS LESS THAN 3%
FOR CHILDREN.
IN THIS COUNTRY IT'S 20% AND
GROWING.
>> Jon: NOW WE'RE ON TO
SOMETHING.
THIS IS-- YOU KNOW, THE
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE
COUNTRY IS SUCH A COMPLEX
ECOSYSTEM, AND IT APPEARS THAT
THE TEACHERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE
THE MOST VISIBLE AND ON THE
FRONT LINES, ARE THE EASIEST
TARGETS OF THE IRE OF THOSE THAT
WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR
FRUSTRATION.
AND IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT
EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY ISN'T
IN TOUGH TIMES.
WHY DO YOU TEACHERS, DO YOU
THINK, COME UNDER SUCH FIRE AND
HOW IMPORTANT ARE THEY WITHIN
THE SCHEME OF IT?
>> WELL, JON, I'VE BEEN
TRAVELING THIS PAST YEAR SINCE
MY BOOK CAME OUT, AND I'VE GOT
TO 80 OR 90 DIFFERENT PLACES ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY, AND THE ONE
THING I'VE LEARNED IS TEACHERS
ACROSS AMERICA ARE DEMORALIZED.
THEY'RE DEMORALIZED BECAUSE
WE'VE HAD A PUBLIC RHETORIC OF
THE LAST FEW YEARS SAYING THAT
IF TEST SCORES ARE LOW, IT'S THE
TEACHERS' FAULT, AND THAT'S
RIDICULOUS.
BECAUSE IN OUR LOW-POVERTY
SCHOOLS OUR SCORES ARE BEYOND
FINLAND'S.
OUR LOW-POVERTY SCHOOLS DO
INCREDIBLYLY AND IT'S ONLY WHERE
WE HAVE INTENSE POVERTY AND
RACIAL ISOLATION IN PLACES LIKE
DETROIT, WASHINGTON, D.C., AND
BALTIMORE.
WHEREVER YOU FIND POVERTY AND
RACIAL ISOLATION YOU FIND LOW
TEST SCORES BECAUSE KIDS ARE
HOMELESS, THEY'RE HUNGRY,
THEY'RE SICK, NOT GET ANYTHING
MEDICAL CARE.
THOSE THINGS MATTER.
AND YET WE HAVE THIS CORPORATE
REFORM MOVEMENT, HEAVILY FUNDED,
POLITICALLY POWERFUL, BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT THAT SAYS POVERTY
DOESN'T MATTER.
WELL IF YOU'RE HOMELESS AND
YOU'RE HUNGRY, IT DOES MATTER.
>> Jon: ARE THEY SAYING POVERTY
DOESN'T MATTER OR THAT-- I THINK
THERE'S NO DENYING SOME OF THE
PARENTS AND A LOT OF THE PARENTS
AND THE CHILDREN IN THOSE
POVERTY-STRICKEN AREAS AND
SCHOOLS HAVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL
THAT FEELS OUT OF CONTROL TO
THEM, AND THEY WANT AN AVENUE
THAT THEY CAN GO TO.
IS CHOICE THE PROBLEM EITHER?
IT SEEMS LIKE CHARTER SCHOOLS
AREN'T NECESSARILY THE PROBLEM.
NONE OF IT DEALS WITH THE LARGER
ISSUE, WHICH IS THE ENVIRONMENT
AROUND THE SCHOOL.
>> POVERTY IS A PROBLEM.
KIDS CAN BE POOR AND STILL DO
WELL IN SCHOOL.
BUT PEOPLE WHO TEACH IN SCHOOLS
WITH A LOT OF LOW-PERFORMING
KIDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD
TEACHERS.
AND THE WHOLE PUBLIC MONOLOGUE
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN
BLAME THE TEACHERS FOR
EVERYTHING.
>> Jon: THAT THING THAT I THINK
HAS BEEN THE MOST MIND-BLOWING
FOR ME WATCHING THIS DEBATE AND
AFTER SITTING THROUGH THE WALL
STREET DEBATES AND THE TAX CUT
DEBATES, TO SEE PEOPLE BLAME THE
AVARICE OF TEACHERS OR THE
IDEA-- HEY, THEY ONLY WORK NINE
MONTHS A YEAR.
GOD FORBID YOU DO THE JOB OF A
TEACHER FOR A YEAR.
IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND AT HOW--
MY MOTHER WAS A TEACHER FOR
YEARS.
SHE WORKED IN THE EDUCATIONAL
FIELD.
SHE'S STILL IN THE EDUCATIONAL
FIELD.
I COULDN'T BE MORE IMPRESSED BY
WHAT SHE DID AND THE WORK THAT
SHE DID IN HER LIFE.
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA.
AND YET, THAT'S THE
CONVERSATION.
>> YEAH, I HAVE BEEN IN MEETINGS
WITH C.E.O.s AND GOVERNORS AND
THEY SIT AROUND SAYING, "OH,
TEACHING, IT'S ANACY JOB, AND
THEY'RE OVERPAID AND THEIR
BENEFITS ARE TOO MUCH."
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
I'VE BEEN IN STATES-- I WAS
RECENTLY IN ARIZONA WHERE THE
AVERAGE TEACHER PAY SOMEWHERE
UNDER $40,000.
I'D LIKE TO SEE A GOVERNOR LIVE
ON $40,000.
>> Jon: BUT THEY GET TO ALSO GO
TO THE DENTIST.
( LAUGHTER )
AND YOU DIDN'T-- YOU DIDN'T
MENTION THAT.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: WHAT CAN BE DONE THOUGH?
WHAT REFORMS-- LET'S SAY THERE
IS-- ARE THERE REFORMS ON THE
TEACHERS' SIDE THAT YOU THINK
ACTUALLY COULD BE IMPLEMENTED
THAT THEY COULD DO THAT COULD
ALSO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION?
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT-- IT'S GOING
TO TAKE A COOPERATIVE EFFORT.
>> WELL, LET ME JUST SAY THAT
THINK THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING
DONE NOW BY SECRETARY DUNCAN, BY
THE GATES FOUNDATION, BY ALL
THESE VERY WEALTHY, POWERFUL
PEOPLE ARE TAKING US DOWN THE
WRONG TRACK BECAUSE THEY'RE
FOCUSED SOLELY ON HOW WE FIND
THE BAD TEACHERS.
I DON'T THINK AMERICA IS OVERRUN
WITH BAD TEACHERS.
I THINK AMERICA IS OVERRUN BY
TOO MUCH POVERTY, TOO MUCH
POVERTY AMONG CHILDREN.
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT WORKS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
TALKING ABOUT WHICH TEACHERS DO
YOU FIND AND PUNISH BECAUSE
THEIR KIDS DIDN'T GET HIGH
SCORES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN
HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE AND WE
HAVE PRE-K EDUCATION, BIRTH TO
FIVE-YEAR-OLD EDUCATION.
THERE'S A GAP WHICH KIDS START
SCHOOL.
THERE'S A GAP AT AGE THREE WHERE
POOR KIDS BEGIN AND THEY'RE
ALREADY BEHIND BECAUSE THEY
DON'T HAVE ACCESS.
>> Jon: THE WHOLE BAD TEACHERS
ARGUMENT BLOWS MY MIND.
YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE WORLD?
THERE ARE BAD EVERYTHING.
HOW MANIES ARE YOU BEEN TO THE
BANK TO-- LIKE, THERE ARE CRAPPY
PEOPLE WORKING ALMOST IN EVERY
FIELD.
( LAUGHTER )
AND, YET, SOMEHOW TEACHERS DON'T
HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING A
COUPLE OF CRAPPY ONES.
SORRY.
>> WELL, I WAS-- I WAS WITH A
PRINCIPAL THE OTHER DAY IN
CALIFORNIA.
WE WERE ON A TALK SHOW IN LOS
ANGELES.
AND I SAID, "HOW MANY TEACHERS
HAVE YOU SUPERVISED?"
SHE SAID, "I'VE BEEN A PRINCIPAL
FOR 15 YEARS.
I'VE SUPERVISED 300 TEACHERS."
I SAID, "HOW MANY OF THEM WOULD
YOU SAY ARE BAD TEACHERS?"
SHE SAID, "ONE.
>> AND GOT RID OF THAT ONE
TEACHER."
>> Jon: I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
PRINCIPAL WAS ALLOWED TO KILL A
TEACHER.
( APPLAUSE )
I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK THE
UNION WOULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT ONE.
( LAUGHTER )
DIANE RAVITCH, "THE GREAT
AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM." THIS IS
MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
SUBJECTS I THI
