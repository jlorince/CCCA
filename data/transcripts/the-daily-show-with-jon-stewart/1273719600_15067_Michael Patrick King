>> Jon: MY GUEST THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR OF "SEX AND THE CITY 2".
>> I'M HAVING A HOT FLASH.
>> YOU'RE FINE.
>> SERIOUSLY, THEY'RE STARTING.
>> YOU'RE ON A CAMEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARABIAN DESERT.
IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A HOT FLASH YOU'RE DEAD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> THIS IS FABULOUS!
THAT'S MY PHONE!
>> WHO IS YOUR LONG DISTANCE PROVIDER?
>> HELLO, HARRY?
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SNI WOKE YOU UP?
HEY, WAIT, YOU'RE GOING IN AND OUT.
OH, CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

( LAUGHTER ) PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL PATRICK KING.
>> HELLO.
>> Jon: VERY NICE.
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: I HAVE KNOWN MICHAEL PATRICK KING FOR OVER 80 YEARS.
>> YOU KNOW ME SO LONG, WHEN WE MET I WAS STRAIGHT.
( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU STILL ARE.
MOVE ALONG, JON, MOVE LONG.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO EVOLVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
WE WENT TO A WEDDING-- WHERE WAS IT, MONTEREY OR SOMETHING?
>> BIG SUR.
>> Jon: YOU DROVE UP FROM L.A.,
SO I FLEW OUT TO MEET THEM, WE WERE GOING TO DRIVE UP.
IT'S A SIX-HOUR DRIVE.
>> IN MY FIRST CONVERTIBLE I EVER OWNED.
WE LIKE TO CALL IT THE DOORWAY TO HELP.
IT WAS UNDER A BROWNSTOWN.
PEOPLE USED TO PEE NEAR MY DOOR.
>> Jon: IT IS THE PLACE NOW YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR BICYCLE.
>> IT'S A SHRINE THERE NOW.
LADIES DROP BUCKETS OF SHOES THERE.
( LAUGHTER ) YOU HAVE ALL THE COMEDY CLUB STORIES.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH ENERGY A LONG TIME.
>> Jon: I'M SO EXCITED.
I HAVE SIX HOURS OF STORIES-- THREE HOURS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE A COUPLE.
>> TWO OR THREE, I'LL GET ONE IN LIKE NOW.
>> Jon: AND THE FIRST THING YOU SAY TO ME IS?
>> I'M GAY.
>> Jon: AND FOR SIX HOURS, IT WAS LIKE BEING WITH A 16-YEAR-OLD.
>> MEANING YOU.
>> Jon: NO!
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
"DO YOU LIKE ME?" "NO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IS THIS GOING TO GET UGLY?
>> Jon: THERE ARE NO COMFORTABLE THRESHOLDS IN MONTEREY.
THAT'S WHOLE THING.
>> IT WAS FANTASTIC, AND YOU'RE A GOOD LISTENER, AS YOU KNOW.
I HAD A LOT OF STUFF TO GET OUT-- LITERALLY.
( LAUGHTER ) WHAT I SURPRISE I WOUND UP ON "SEX AND THE CITY 2."
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT NEW YORK.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> NO THAT IS THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> Jon: THE PERFECT PLACE FOR A COSMOPOLITAN STORY.
>> I WAS LOOKING FOR A BIG,
EXTRAVAGANT, BLOCKBUSTER VACATIONS FOR THE LADYS IN AMERICA WHO CAN'T AFFORD
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW AND I THOUGHT WHERE DO THEY HAVE MONEY?
ADIEU DHABI.
AND I THOUGHT HOW FUNNY TO PUT SAMANTHA OVERLYLY SEXUALIZED IN ABU DHABI.
>> Jon: YOU WERE IN MOROCCO?
>> FOR MANY WEEKS.
>> Jon: HE BROUGHT DUNES WITH HIM, VERY EXCITING.
>> THAT WAS TIMES SQUARE WITH A LOT OF GREEN SCREEN-- NO.
IT WAS FILMED-- THAT'S THE EXACT SAME DUNE WHERE'S THEY FILMED
"LAWRENCE OF ARABIA."
>> Jon: I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I WAS LOOKING AT THAT THINKING, "WHY DID DOES THAT LOOK SO FAMILIAR?"
YOU COULD HAVE FILLED THAT IN NORTH CAROLINA.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS EXCITING.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD SECURITY OW ALL THE TIME.
I HAD A SECURITY GUY THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE NAMED ABDUL.
ALL THE GIRLS HAD, LIKE, FLESHY,
VERY INFORMATIVE GUYS.
I HAD, LIKE, A NAVY SEAL.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> HE GAVE ME A KNIFE AS A GIFT IN THE SECOND WEEK.
NOT LIKE HERE'S YOUR PARTING KNIFE LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS LATER.
>>.
NO TWOULD HAVE MADE SENSE AS A PARTING GIFT.
>> FOR THE AIRPLANE.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: DID YOU, AT ANY POINT,
HAVE TO GUT ANYTHING?
>> NO, I DID NOT.
JUST MY EMOTIONS.
AGAIN, LADIES, AGAIN.
GET THE HANDMAKEUP AWAY FROM THEM.
NO, I ACTUALLY-- I DIDN'T GUT ANYTHING.
I SAWA LOT OF DEAD BODYS IN MOROCCO.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT SO.
>> I SAW AT LEAST FOUR DEAD BODIES.
LIFE IS CHEAP.
NO, THERE WERE PEOPLE FALLING OFF MOPEDS LEFT AND RIGHT, AND MY DRIVER WOULD LOOK OUT THE
WINDOW AND GO, "HE IS DEAD." AND IT'S NOON.
HE'S DEAD.
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING-- WHY IS YOUR DRIVER'S STEERING WHEEL SO TINY?
>> EVERYTHING IS SMALLER OVERSEAS, JON.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BIG AMERICAN GAS GUZZ LERZ.
EVERYTHING IS TINY.
>> Jon: AMERICA IT WOULD BE THAT GUY IS DEAD.
>> I LOVE YOUR DELICATE TEAMSTER COMEDY WORK.
>> Jon: I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH MORE FUN ARE YOU GAY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING LIKE THIS.
( LAUGHTER ) IS ANYONE GUESSING ANYTHING?
SHOULD I SAY THAT WORD?
>> Jon: IT'S JUST-- I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND YOUR SUCCESS AND
EVERYTHING, JUST THE BEST.
YOU GAVE ME MY FIRST JOB EVER IN TELEVISION.
>> I HIRED YOU FOR A COMEDY SHOW.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT SOMEHOW PANNED OUT FOR YOU.
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
>> MY PLEASURE, JONNY.
>> Jon: IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU,
MY FRIEND.
