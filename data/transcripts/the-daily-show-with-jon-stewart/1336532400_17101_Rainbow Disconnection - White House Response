AHHH.
JOE BIDE MONEY IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS SAYS WHAT HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF GAY MARRIAGE.
I ASSUME HE RECOGNIZED THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
IMMEDIATELY.
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PROGRAM AIR BIDEN'S OFFICE SAID
HE WAS SPEAKING HIM R FOR HIMSELF AND NOT MAKING NEW POLICY.
>> Jon: IT'S THE OLD MOM ROUTINE.
IF IT WERE UP TO ME, HONEY, I WOULD LET YOU GO TO THE PARTY.
I WOULD BUY YOU A SIX PACK TO SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER IS.
OBVIOUSLY BIDE SEASON SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF AND NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> DAVID AXELROD TWEETED THIS "WHAT VP SAID THAT ALL MARRIED
COUPLES SHOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME LEGAL RIGHTS IS PRECISELY THE POSITION."
>> Jon: HASH TAG BIEBER JUST A REFRESM.
HE SAID IT'S THE POSITION BECAUSE VP SAID HASH TAG GAY MARRIAGE GOOD LOL.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS SIMPLE AS VP AND POTUS HAVE SAME POSITION.
JAY CARNEY.
>> LET ME BE CLEAR.
THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT THE SAID ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS WITH CITIZENS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON THIS ISSUE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THIS.
THE PRESIDENT IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO DESCRIBE HIS OWN PERSONAL VIEWS.
HE, AS YOU KNOW SAID HIS VIEWS ON THIS WERE EVOLVING.
>> Jon: AH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO WITH REGARDS TO GAY MARRIAGE THE VICE PRESIDENT'S NEW POSITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
PRESIDENT'S POSITION WHICH HAS NOT CHANGED AND IS ALSO CHANGING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S NOT A SOCIAL POLICY THAT'S A ZEN CONE.
MR. CARNEY --
>> IT IS AS IT WAS, YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: IT IS AS IT WAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND WHAT MASTER IS THE SOUND OF ONE MAN SWEATING?
AND WHY ARE THEY SWEATING PHYSICAL SO HARD.
>> SO SENSITIVE TO BIDEN DOING THIS BECAUSE NUMBER ONE GAY MONEY IN THIS ELECTION HAS
REPLACED WALL STREET MONEY.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GAY MONEY AND WALL STREET MONEY IS WHEN YOU
PUT GAY MONEY IN ONE
