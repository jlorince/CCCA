FOR THE FIRST TIME.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  THE CONGRESS MET
FOR THE FIRST TIME, RIGHT ON ATUESDAY, A TUESDAY.
COULDN'T GO BACK TO WORK ON AMONDAY?
WHY WOULD YOU GO BACK TO WORK ONMONDAY?
MONDAY WAS KAMAKURA JAPAN'SFESTIVAL OF JOMA SHINJI.
YOU COULDN'T WORK ON THAT DAY ORIT WAS THE 12th DAY OF
CHRISTMAS.
IF YOU'RE NOT HOME TO SIGN FORYOUR DELIVERY OF 12 DRUMMERS
DRUMMING.
YOU KNOW, FEDEX JUST LEAVES THEMON YOUR DOORSTEP.
OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T -- COME ON,CONGRESS!
YOUR FIRST DAY BACK FROM THEHOLIDAY BREAK IS A TUESDAY?
EVEN WE CAME BACK ON MONDAY, ANDWE'RE SO LAZY, DOT, DOT, DOT.
( LAUGHTER )NOBODY-- NOBODY FINISHED WRITING
THAT? THEY JUST --
( LAUGHTER )IT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD PREMISE.
THERE'S REALLY -- YOU KNOWWHAT, I'D FIRE THOSE PEOPLE IF
THEY DIDN'T WORK ON A DIFFERENTFLOOR AND I'D HAVE TO GO
ALL THE WAY UP THERE...
( LAUGHTER )ALL RIGHT, CONGRESS TOOK AN
EXTRA DAY OF VACATION.
FINE.
BUT ONCE TUESDAY ROLLED AROUND,BAM!
CRACK OF DAWN, NATION'SBUSINESS, GAVEL IT IN.
>> MANY LAWMAKERS HAVE UNTILNOON TO MAKE IT TO THE HILL.
THAT'S WHEN THE 114thCONGRESS WILL BE SWORN IN.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU BLEEPSERIOUS?
( LAUGHTER )NOON!
YOU HAD TO GET THERE AT NOON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NORMALLY THAT WOULD MAKE ME MADBUT SINCE CONGRESS PROBABLY
ISN'T GOING TO BE DOING ANYTHINGANYWAY, ALL RIGHT, WHY NOT GET A
LATE START?
HELL, WHY NOT JUST SERVE THEMLEGISLATION IN BED FOR GOD'S
SAKE.
( LAUGHTER )NO WONDER YOU FOLKS HAVE A 14%
APPROVAL RATING.
AND APPARENTLY A ROUGHLY 95%INCUMBENCY RATE.
YOU KNOW, 14% DISAPPROVAL TO 95%INCUMBENCY, IT'S THE SAME
DISAPPROVAL-TO-RECURRENCE RATIOCURRENTLY ENJOYED BY THE HERPES
VIRUS.
HERPES-- IT'S LIKE CONGRESS ONYOUR DICK.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )WHAT'S THAT?
IS THAT THE ARBY'S FONT?
THAT'S JUST A CHEAP SHOT.
SO OTHER THAN THE REPUBLICANSNOW TAKING CONTROL OF THE
SENATE, AS WELL AS THE HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES, NOTHING MUCH
HAS CHANGED ON CAPITOL HILL.
EXCEPT ON ME, GOD!
THAT'S A KORAN!
THEY'RE SWEARING IN ON A KORAN.
OH, NO, NO, WAIT. CHRISTIANBIBLE. CHRISTIAN BIBLE.
EVERYBODY, LOOKS LIKEWE'VE STAVED OFF THE THREAT OF
SHARIA LAW FOR MAYBE ONE MORECONGRESSIONAL SEASON,
BUT IT'S COMING.
ALL RIGHT THE SENATE CHANGEDHANDS,
IT'S BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPENBEFORE.
AND NOW THAT THE REPUBLICANSHOLD THE NATION'S MOST
DELIBERATIVE BODY, TO WHAT LOFTYGOALS DOES THE SENATE ASPIRE?
>> SENATE MAJORITY LEADERINCOMING MITCH McCONNELL SAID
TO THE "WASHINGTON POST" THATHE WANTS REPUBLICANS TO
NOT APPEAR SCARY, HIS WORDS.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  SURE WOULDN'T WANT
TO -- SURE WOULDN'T WANT TOSTARTLE FOLKS.
( LAUGHTER )WITH ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
OH LOOK AT THAT, HE'S WEARINGHIS -- THAT'S EXCITING.
HE'S WEARING HIS-- HE'S WEARINGHIS FESTIVE SWEARING IN SHELL.
IT'S A REPLICA OF THE ROTUNDA.
CAPITOL DOME.
WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE, A PARTYCHANGE WILL AT LEAST BRING SOME
FRESH NEW BLOOD TO SENATELEADERSHIP. NEW FINANCE
COMMITTEE CHAIR WILL BE--80-YEAR-OLD ORRIN HATCH.
THE NEW JUDICIARY CHAIR WILL BE81-YEAR-OLD CHUCK GRASSLEY.
THE NEW ARMED SERVICES CHAIR,78-YEAR-OLD JOHN McCAIN.
THE NEW AGRICULTURE CHAIR,78-YEAR-OLD PAT ROBERTS.
AND FINALLY, NEW ENVIRONMENTCHAIR, 80-YEAR-OLD JAMES INHOFE.
WHY DO I GET THE IDEA THESECHAIRS ARE MOTORIZED AND SLOWLY
ASCEND STAIRCASES.
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO! NO! NO!
I'M NOT GOING TO BE AGEIST.
MAYBE THESE YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPERS HAVE FRESH NEW IDEAS
LIKE THE NEW ENVIRONMENTCHAIR INHOFE.
>> THE ASSERTION THAT GLOBALWARMING IS OCCURRING TODAY, THAT
IT'S OCCURRING BECAUSE OF THERELEASE OF C.O.2.
I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S THEGREATEST HOAX EVER PERPETRATED
ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> Jon:  WE ARE DOOMED!
NOW, WAIT, IN HIS DEFENSE, IT'SHARD TO BELIEVABLE IN GLOBAL
WARMING WHEN YOU ALWAYS FEELDRAFTY.
( LAUGHTER )NOW IT'S TOO HOT.
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE CRUSTY OLDSENATE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WHERETWO-TIME HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN
BOEHNER BECAME THREE-TIME HOUSESPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER AFTER
FENDING OFF A MINOR CHALLENGEFROM... AN IDIOT.
BOEHNER GAVELED -- OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD, JOHN BOEHNER HASBECOME THE WOOD OF HIS OWN
GAVEL!
( LAUGHTER )JOHN BOEHNER-- HE-- HE IS GROOT.
HE IS GROOT.
( APPLAUSE )WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.
YOUR NEW HOUSE AND SENATEREPUBLICAN MAJORITY, SMOOTH
SAILING FOR THEM FROM HERE ONOUT.
>> REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISEIS FACING BACKLASH AFTER IT WAS
REVEALED HE SPOKE BEFORE A WHITESUPREMACIST ORGANIZATION IN
2002.
>> Jon: OH REALLY, ALITTLE BACKLASH?
WELL, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT WITHA LITTLE HISTORICAL CONTENT.
I MEAN, BACK IN2002, I MEAN, BACK THEN,
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HAD ONLYBEEN
IN EFFECT FOR A REALLY LONGTIME.
GOOD LUCK SPINNING YOUR WAY OUTOF THIS ONE, SCALISE.
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHOTHAT GROUP WAS BUT FROM WHAT
I'VE SEEN ABOUT THEM THEY DON'TREPRESENT THE VALUES THAT I
REPRESENT.
I DETEST HATE GROUPS OF ANYKIND.
>> Jon:  SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE
TALKING TO A WHITE SUPREMACISTGROUP?
WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS JUSTAN ODDLY MUSIC-LESS TOGA PARTY?
>> HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW?
THE GROUP WAS FOUNDED BY FORMERKU KLUX KLAN GRAND WIZARD DAVID
DUKE. CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS CALLEDDUKE'S ORGANIZATION A
LEADING HATE GROUP.
>> Jon:  YES, IT'S ONE OF THELEADING, IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE
TOP HATE GROUPS.
IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE SAFETYHATE GROUPS PEOPLE DON'T GET IN
WHEN THEY DON'THATE WELL ENOUGH.
AND BY THE WAY, THAT'S NO BULL(BLEEP) RANKINGS.
THOSE RANKINGS ARE DETERMINED BYJ.D. WHITE POWER AND ASSOCIATES.
SO THE REPUBLICANS, THEY HAVESOME ISSUES, BUT WITH THE WHOLE
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO COMMANDTHEY CAN FINALLY RAMP THEIR
AGENDA UP AND GET IT THROUGH.
>> EXPECT PRESIDENT OBAMA TODUST OFF THE VETO PEN.
HE'S ONLY USED IT TWICE.
THAT'S THE LEAST OF ANYPRESIDENT IN 130 YEARS SINCE
JAMES GARFIELD.
BUT GARFIELD HAD A PRETTY GOOD
REASON FOR NOT ISSUING ANYVETOES.
HE WAS SHOT JUST FOUR MONTHSINTO OFFICE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WHAT? PRETTY GOODREASON?
YOU HAVE A HIGH VETO BAR, MYFRIEND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
