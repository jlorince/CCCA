THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE
JUDICIOUS PLACEMENT.
DOESN'T ANYBODY HAVE A REAL
OBJECTION?
>> DO NOT ASK ME TO ENTER
THE MIND OF THE
TOTALITARIANS RUNNING THIS
GOVERNMENT, OR THE CITY.
THIS MEANS SOMETHING MUCH
MORE THAN THE SPECIFICS OF
THIS DREADFUL PROGRAM.
IT MEANS, ENVISION WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A
GOVERNMENT THAT IS RUN BY AN
AUTOCRATIC MAYOR OR OTHER
LEADER AND A GOVERNMENT
BEFORE WHICH YOU WERE
HELPLESS.

COMPLAINTS TO BE MADE AND TO

NEIGHBORHOOD BEING
DESECRATED BY THESE UGLY

THAT BLOOMBERG HAS DONE
THIS.
>> APART FROM THE 159
MEETINGS, HE DIDN'T SAY A
WORD.
>> OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS SOME
COMMUNITY OUTREACH BUT THEY
PUT THESE STATIONS DOWN
WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS.
FOR EXAMPLE, ON WEST FOURTH
STREET.
>> OKAY, WELL, EVEN THOUGH
THAT IS NOT TRUE, WHY IS IT?
>> YES, EVERYONE HATES CITY
BIKE, EVEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS
THAT DON'T HAVE IT.
>> LIKE BROOKLYN'S BEN.
>> WHERE CITY BIKE WHERE WE
REALLY NEED A CITY BOOK.
AIN'T NO CITY BIKE IN THE
HOOD.
>> YOU ARE SAYING PEOPLE IN
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD NEED THE
BIKES.
