( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  AS WE HAVE HEARD,
THE 114th CONGRESS IS NOWOFFICIALLY IN SESSION.
100 SENATORS, 435 CONGRESSPEOPLE SET TO DO THE NATION'S
BUSINESS.
>> LESS THAN A WEEK AFTERPLEADING GUILTY TO TAX EVASION,
CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMM SAYSHE'S RESIGNING.
>> HE DECIDED TO RESIGNBECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELIEVE HE
CAN CONTINUE TO BE 100%EFFECTIVE.
>> Jon:  BECAUSE HE WILL BEIN JAIL.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW -- IT'S SAD THAT BEINGIN JAIL AND HE STILL
HAS TO THINK LIKE, I COULDSTILL DO THIS, RIGHT?
( LAUGHTER )I COULD BE, LIKE, 92%, 93%
CONGRESS PERSON FROM JAIL.I MEAN, HOW HARD IS IT?
YOU MAY REMEMBER STATENISLAND'S MICHAEL GRIMM
AS THE GENTLEMAN WHO THREATENEDTO THROW ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
OFF THE BALCONY AND BREAK HIMLIKE A BOY WHEN HE HAD THE GALL
TO ASK GRIMM A QUESTION BECAUSEHE'S A REPORTER.
IT WAS DURING A TELEVISIONINTERVIEW.
OH I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SWEETBOY-BREAKING PRINCE.
>> GRIMM COPPED TO A SINGLE
COUNT OF HIDING NEARLY $1MILLION IN REVENUE FROM A
MANHATTAN RESTAURANT HE OWNED.
>> Jon:  A MILLION DOLLARS?
WOW!
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.
HOW DID HE PULL THAT OFF?
>> I HAD, FOR EXAMPLE, DELIVERYBOYS THAT WERE PAID OFF THE
BOOKS, AND AS A RESULT THE TAXESWERE NOT ACCURATE.
EVERYONE PAYS PEOPLE OFF THEBOOKS AND IT'S VERY COMMON BUT
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR -- IT'SWRONG.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  WHAT KIND OF
APOLOGY IS THAT?
"BUT EVERYBODY DOES IT.
LOOK, DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T DOIT.
YOU DO IT.
YOU PAY PEOPLE OFF THE BOOKS.
WHO DOESN'T COMMIT A LITTLE TAXFRAUD.
YOU KNOW! BUT I'M TAKING THEFALL FOR IT,
YOU SONS OF ( BLEEP )." BY THEWAY, EXCONGRESSMAN, YOUR
HEALTHALICIOUS ESTABLISHMENTDEFRAUDED THE GOVERNMENT OF
TAXES ON NEARLY $1 MILLION OFUNREPORTED REVENUE WAGES.
SO DON'T ACT LIKE THAT'SEXPLAINED BY A COUPLE OF
OFF THE BOOKS DELIVERY BOYS.
I MEAN, JESUS, LET'S SAYYOU PAID EACH DELIVERY BOY
AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE, WHICHI'M SURE YOU DIDN'T.
AND LET'S SAY THAT THESEWORKERS PUT IN AT LEAST 40 HOURS
A WEEK FOR FOUR YEARS.
AND THAT GRIMM OWED THE FEDS,STATE, AND CITY ABOUT, OH, I
DON'T KNOW, 16% ON THOSESALARIES.
THAT'S ROUGHLY 7 BUCKS AN HOURTIMES 40 HOURS, TIMES 52 WEEKS
TIMES FOUR YEARS, TIMES 16%.
DIVIDE A MILLION DOLLARS BY THATNUMBER, AND MICHAEL GRIMM'S
HEALTHALICIOUS RESTAURANT WASAPPARENTLY EMPLOYING 107
FULL-TIME DELIVERY BOYS.
WHERE DID THEY KEEP THEBICYCLES?
AND WHILE THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE AFACELESS FINANCIAL CRIME,
ITS VICTIMS ARE ALL TOO FACEFUL.
>> ON THIS FIRST DAYBACK-TO-WORK ON THE CAPITOL,
STATEN ISLAND RESIDENTS WILLHAVE NO REPRESENTATION
IN CONGRESS.
>> FOR MORE WE TURN TO JASONJONES IN FORMER CONGRESSMAN

>> JON, IT IS A DISASTER.
ONE DAY WITHOUT CONGRESSIONALREPRESENTATION, AND STATEN
ISLAND HAS BECOME A WASTELANDOF -- A WASTELAND OF NAIL SALONS
AND TASTELESS LAWN ORNAMENTS.
>> Jon:  ACTUALLY, JASON, ITHINK THAT THAT'S --
>> CONDITIONS HERE HAVEDETERIORATED SO FAST, THE MEN
HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SELL THESLEEVES OFF THEIR SHIRTS.
SURVIVING SOLELY ON GARLIC KNOTSAND MUSCLE MILKS.

>> Jon: THAT IS A VERY SERIOUSTOPIC, VERY SERIOUS TOPIC AND
IT SOUNDS LIKE ACOMPETITIVE RACE.
>> IT IS.
BUT, OF COURSE, THE FRONT-RUNNERIS STATEN ISLAND DISTRICT
ATTORNEY DAN DONOVAN.
>> Jon: ARE YOU -- THEPROSECUTOR WHO COULDN'T
OR WOULDN'T GET A GRAND JURYTO INDICT THE COP THAT
CHOKED OUT ERIC GARNER?>> YEAH.

IT'S LIKE A JOKE, THEWASHER-DRYER THING.
VERY DROLL, JASON.

>> YEAH, IT'S NO JOKE.
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ELECTDAN DONOVAN.

SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU CANLAUNDER THROUGH YOUR AVERAGE
