(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
OF COURSE ONE KEY QUESTIONABOUT LAST WEEK'S PARIS
BRUTALITY IS WHO BEARSRESPONSIBILITY.
AND AN EASIER QUESTION TO THATIS WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO
UTTERLY BOTCH THAT FIRSTQUESTION?
>> I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT ATWEET, IT'S BY BUSINESS AND
MEDIA MAGNATE RUPERT MURDOCH.
"MAYBE MOST MUSLIMS AREPEACEFUL BUT UNTIL THEY
RECOGNIZE AND DESTROY THEIRGROWING JIHADIST
CANCER THEY MUST BEHELD RESPONSIBLE."
>> HIS EXCELLENCY FROM THEREPUBLIC OF MEDIA CONGLOMI-STAN.
HE HAS SPOKE-TWEETED,
MODERATE MUSLIMS, UNTIL YOUHAVE COMPLETELY WIPED
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS FROM THISEARTH, THIS [BLEEP] IS ON YOU.
BECAUSE YOU SEE RUPERTMURDOCH HAS A VERY FIRM
STANCE THAT WHEN SOMESMALL SUBSET OF ANY GROUP
COMMITS TERRIBLE CRIMINALACTS, ALL MEMBERS OF THAT
GROUP SHOULD BE CONSIDEREDGUILTY BY ASSOCIATION AND HELD
RESPONSIBLE.
EXCEPT IF THE CRIMINAL ACTSARE NEWSPAPERS HACKING DEAD
PEOPLE'S PHONES AND IF THEHEAD OF THAT NEWSPAPER
COMPANY IS RUPERT MURDOCH.
>> MR. MURDOCH, DO YOUACCEPT THAT ULTIMATELY YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FORTHIS WHOLE FIASCO?
>> NO.
>> YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
>> THE PEOPLE THAT I TRUSTEDTO RUN IT AND THEN MAYBE THE
PEOPLE THEY TRUSTED.
>> Jon: AND THEN MAYBE, IDON'T KNOW, MAYBE THEN
MUSLIMS.
HOW ABOUT THAT? MUSLIMS.
BUT MURDOCH WASN'T ALONE INDEMANDING ANSWERS.
>> MODERATE MUSLIMS KNOW WHOTHE RADICALS ARE.
WHY DON'T THEY DRUM THEMOUT?
>> THIS HAS GOT TO BE STOPPED BYOTHER MUSLIMS, MODERATE
MUSLIMS.
>> THEIR SILENCE NOT ONLY ISDEAFENING BUT TO A CERTAIN
DEGREE ENCOURAGING OF THISRADICAL ISLAMIC ATTACKS.
>> YOU SEE PLENTY OF MUSLIMSTHAT ARE MODERATE.
WHY AREN'T THEY MARCHING INTHE STREETS SAYING END THIS
RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: I THINK THE MUSLIMMUSLIMS SHOULD DO THAT.
