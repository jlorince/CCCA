>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREATDIRECTOR MR. TIM BURTON IS GOING
TO BE JOINING US FOR HIS FILM,"BIG EYES".
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
BUT FIRST, THIS WEEKEND PEOPLEALL OVER THE COUNTRY CAME
TOGETHER TO STATE UNEQUIVOCALLYEVEN THE MOST DEPRAVED VIOLENCE
IS JUSTIFIED IN THE FACE OFFEAR.
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S NOTTHEM. THAT'S -- NO, THOSE ARE
PROTESTS AGAINST FEAR-BASEDVIOLENCE. I, WHERE'S MY,
WHERE'S MY EXCUSING FEAR-BASEDVIOLENCE? -- THERE WE GO!
YES, THE DIRECTORS OF THE C.I.A.
CURRENT AND FORMER APPROACHEDTHE BENCH AND ARGUED THE PRO
CASE REBUTTING THE SENATE BLACKSITE TORTURE PRISON REPORT.
FIRST UP, FORMER CIADIRECTOR MICHAEL HAYDEN.
>> THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOURATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE DEFINED
THIS AS NOT BEING TORTURE.
SO LET'S GET THE LEGALDEFINITION OFF THE TABLE.
>> Jon: THREE OUT OF FOUR! OURINTERROGATION PRACTICES DON'T
EVEN MAKE IT TOSUGARLESS GUM APPROVAL
PERCENTAGES! (LAUGHTER)
I DID THE MATH ON THEFRACTIONS THERE.
BY THE WAY, COINCIDENTALLY,THE THREE OUT OF THE FOUR
ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALL, I'M SUREIT'S A COINCIDENCE HAPPENED TO
BE PRESIDENT GEORGEW. BUSH'S ATTORNEY GENERAL.
SO IF YOU WANTED AN EVENSTRONGER STATISTIC, YOU COULD
SAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OFATTORNEYS GENERAL TOLD
TO SAY WHATEVER WE DID WASN'TTORTURE SAID THAT.
MATH!
CURRENT C.I.A. DIRECTOR BRENNAN.
>> I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THEREWERE TIMES WHEN C.I.A. OFFICERS
EXCEEDED THE POLICY GUIDANCETHAT WAS GIVEN, BUT WE ARE NOT A
PERFECT INSTITUTION.
>> Jon: DO NOT JUDGE LEST YEBE JUDGED.
FOR LET HE WHO HAS NEVER SHOVEDA TUBE OF PUREED HUMMUS
UP A MAN'S ARSE CAST THE FIRSTSTONE.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE GUYS?
IT FEELS LIKE THEY'REINTRODUCING EVEN THE SMALLEST
HINT OF NUANCE TOTHE CONVERSATION.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEETHOSE TWO GIVING AID AND COMFORT
TO THE ENEMY.
PERHAPS IT'S TIME FOR ANAMERICAN TO DEFEND THE PROGRAM.
ONE OF OUR NATION'S FOUNDINGFATHERS.
ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS?
AND NOW!
STEPPING INTO THE RING!
A 5'8", TWO-TIME VICE PRESIDENT,MULTIPLE TIME DRAFT DEFEREE,
HAILING FROM AN UNDISCLOSEDLOCATION,
A MAN SO MEAN, HIS OWN HEART RANAWAY,
THE DARK CURTAIN FROMHALLIBURTON, THE IRAQ BLASTER
FROM CASPER, THEPRESIDENTIAL PUPPET MASTER,
MORE MACHINE THAN MAN! DICK "THEDICK" CHENEY!
PRESS THE MEAT! WM-DEFEND THISPROGRAM
>> NOW, YOU SAID EARLIER THISWEEK TORTURE WAS SOMETHING THAT
WAS VERY CAREFULLY AVOIDED.
IT IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE ADEFINITION OF WHAT TORTURE IS.
WHAT IS IT?
>> WELL, TORTURE TO ME, CHUCK,IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN ON A CELL
PHONE MAKING THE LAST CALL TOHIS FOUR YOUNG DAUGHTERS SHORTLY
BEFORE HE BURNS TO DEATH IN THEUPPER LEVELS OF THE TRADE CENTER
IN NEW YORK CITY ON 9/11.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: AND THAT IS WHY HE IS
THE BEST WORST.
DICK CHENEY SETTING THISNATION'S MORAL BAR AT ANYTHING
INCREMENTALLY BETTER THAN THEMOST DESPICABLE THING THAT HAS
EVER BEEN DONE TO US.
AND BY THE WAY, THAT WAS OUT OFTHE GATE.
THE WAS THE FIRST QUESTION HEWAS ASKED.
HE HAD JUST MET THE PRESS AND HEOPENED WITH 9/11.
THAT'S LIKE LYNYRD SKYNYRDWALKING OUT AND GOING HEY, WHY
DON'T WE JUST KICK IT OFF WITH ALITTLE "FREE BIRD." HOW ABOUT
THAT?
SEE IF THAT CAN SAVE YOU ALITTLE LIGHTER FLUID AND YOUR
SHOUTING VOICES THERE. OFCOURSE, THE PROBLEM WITH DOING
THAT IS YOU DON'T REALLY GIVEYOURSELF ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.
>> YOU WON'T CALL IT TORTURE?
>> I COME BACK TO THEPROPOSITION TORTURE WAS WHAT
AL QAEDA TERRORISTS DID TO 3,000AMERICANS ON 9/11.
IN MY MIND I'VE TOLD YOU WHATMEETS THE DEFINITION OF TORTURE.
IT'S THE WHAT 19 GUYS ARMEDWITH AIRLINE TICKETS
AND BOX CUTTERS DID TO 3,000AMERICANS ON 9/11.
>> NO, I SEE. THAT'S JUST WHATMEETS THE DEFINITION OF TORTURE
IN HIS MIND.
HIS MIND, I ASSUME BEING THESCARIEST (BLEEP) PLACE IN THE
UNIVERSE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?  I'M SORRY.
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA HAUNT MYNIGHTMARES.
I DON'T CARE. I'VE GOTTA KNOW.
CHUCK, CAN WE ZOOM INSIDE DICKCHENEY'S MIND?
>> DOES THAT MEET THE DEFINITIONOF TORTURE IN YOUR MIND?
>> IN MY MIND --
♪ SUCH A PRETTY SIGHT TO SEE  ♪  WHAT A JOY IT IS TO BE
♪  HERE IN UNICORNIA
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: HMM, NEVER -- NEVER TOOK
HIM FOR A BRONY.
EVERY TIME I THINK THIS MANCAN'T GET MORE FASCINATING.
SO, I GUESS WE CAN TEST. ISDICK CHENEY A RIGHTEOUS WARRIOR
OR A PSYCHOPATH?
IT'S ONE THING TO FEELREMORSELESS VENGEANCE AGAINST
THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED US.
WHICH IS WHY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ANATION THAT'S FOLLOWED THE
VIGILANTE'S CODE -- I'MSORRY, RULE OF LAW.
RULE OF LAW.
BUT WHAT IF HYPOTHETICALLY, THISTREATMENT WAS PERPETRATED ON
SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN DETAINEDWRONGLY, SURELY THAT WOULD
SOFTEN CHENEY'S BRONSON-LIKETORTURE BONER.
>> LET ME GO TOGUL RAHMAN.
HE WAS CHAINED TO THE WALL OFHIS CELL, DOUSED WITH WATER,
FROZE TO DEATH IN C.I.A.
CUSTODY.
AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A CASEOF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
>> Jon: DICK?
>> RIGHT.
BUT THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITHALL THE FOLKS THAT WE DID
RELEASE THAT ENDED UPBACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD.
I'M MORE CONCERNED WITH BAD GUYSWHO GOT OUT AND RELEASED THAN I
AM WITH A FEW THAT, IN FACT,WERE INNOCENT.
>> Jon: IT'S LIKE THIS GUY'STHE VICE PRESIDENT IN A
CORMAC McCARTHY NOVEL.
CALL IT, CALL IT, FRIENDO!
WAA -- CALL IT, FRIENDO -- WAA-- HEADS -- WAAA.
BUT LOOK, PERHAPS WE'RE BEINGUNFAIR, I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT
DICK CHENEY IS USING THETERRIBLE SPECTER OF WHAT
HAPPENED ON 9/11 ROBOTICALLY, ASA CUDGEL TO BEAT DOWN ARGUMENT,
DRAINING ALL EMOTION ANDMEANING OUT OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY
AS HE USES IT IN SERVICE OFAVOIDING CULPABILITY.
YEAH, I'M NOT DOING THAT.
CHENEY DOES FEEL UPSET.
CHENEY DOES FEEL HURT, ANGRYEVEN AT HAVING TO ANSWER THINGS.
>> WHEN YOU SAY WATERBOARDING ISNOT TORTURE THEN WHY DID WE
PROSECUTE JAPANESESOLDIERS IN WORLD WAR II?
>> FOR, FOR A LOT OF STUFF. NOTFOR WATERBOARDING.
THEY DID AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHERSTUFF.
IT'S A REALLY CHEAP SHOT, CHUCK,TO EVEN TRY TO DRAW A PARALLEL.
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S TOO FARCHARLES DAVID CHUCK TODD!
THAT WAS A LOADED QUESTION.
YOU CAN'T JUST POP UP OUT OFNOWHERE AND SHOOT AN OLD MAN
IN THE FACE WITH A QUESTION LIKETHAT! HOW DARE YOU, CHUCK TODD!
AT LONG LAST, WHY WOULD YOU ASKABOUT DECENCY? SO WITH THE
MORAL CONTROVERSY PUT TO BED,LET'S FOCUS ON EFFICACY.
THE MUCH RESEARCHED SENATEC.I.A. REPORT SUGGESTED THE
INFORMATION COULD HAVE AND INMANY CASES WAS
OBTAINED BY DIFFERENT MOREGENEVA CONVENTION-Y, LESS
BUTT FEED-Y METHODS.
>> IT WORKED. IT WORKED NOW FOR13 YEARS.
IT ABSOLUTELY DID WORK.
I'D DO IT AGAIN IN A MINUTE.
>> Jon: WOULDN'T GIVE IT ATHOUGHT. WAA.
(LAUGHTER)AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUTDICK CHENEY.
HE'S IMPERVIOUS TO DOUBT.
NEVER ENTERS HIS MIND.PROBABLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE
LITTLE PONIES RUNNING AROUND UPTHERE, BUT
NEVER ENTERS HIS MIND THAT THECONFIDENT, PLAIN-SPOKEN
PRONOUNCEMENTS OF TRUTH AREOFTENTIMES COMPLETE (BLEEP).
JUST FROM HIS APPEARANCES ON"MEET THE PRESS."
>> THAT REPORT HAS BEEN PRETTYWELL CONFIRMED THAT HE DID GO TO
PRAGUE AND HE DID MEET WITHTHE SENIOR OFFICIAL OF THE
IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. ANDSADDAM HUSSEIN HAS A LONG
STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITHVARIOUS TERRORIST GROUPS
INCLUDING THE AL QAEDAORGANIZATION.
WE BELIEVE HE HAS IN FACTRECONSTITUTED NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
HE HAS BEEN SEEKING TO ACQUIRETHE KIND OF TUBES THAT ARE
NECESSARY TO BUILD A CENTRIFUGE.
THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT I THINKWOULD BE ONE OF THE LEADING,
PERHAPS THE LEADING STATE INTHAT PART OF THE WORLD.
MY BELIEF IS WE WILL IN FACT BEGREETED AS LIBERATORS.
>> Jon: GUESS WHAT, THEYLOVED IT SO MUCH THEY WOULDN'T
LET US LEAVE FOR OVER A DECADE.
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST BECAUSE HE'S SO BITTER ANDANGRY DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO BE.
I'M GOING TO END ON A NOTE OFGRATITUDE, WITH SOMETHING THAT I
NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SAY:GEORGE W. BUSH, THANK YOU FOR
NOT DYING WHILE YOUWERE IN OFFICE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
