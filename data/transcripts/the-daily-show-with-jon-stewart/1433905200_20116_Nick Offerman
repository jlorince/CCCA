>> Jon:  "GUMPTION"!
SO THIS BOOK, AND I HAVE READIT--
>> THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
>> Jon: -- INCLUDES PROFILESOF INDIVIDUALS YOU ADMIRE.
THE WRITING IS FUNNY.
IT IS WITTY, IT ISURBANE, IT IS INSIGHTFUL, BUT
THE SENTIMENT IS SINCERE.
IT IS A REAL PAY-IN TO THESEINDIVIDUALS.
NO MATTER WHERE I PICKED IT UP,I HAD TO FINISH WHO YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT WHETHER YOKO ONOOR GEORGE SANDERS OR --
>> THANK YOU.
THAT'S MY INTENTION.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO PLAY OUT LIKE AMIXED TAPE, WHERE EACH BAND
BE IT ROOSEVELT, OR CONANO'BRIAN OR CAROLL BURNET, YOU
SAY, OH, MY GOD, I HAVE TO GETTHE REST OF THESE PEOPLE'S
RECORDS.
>> Jon: AND I READ IT LIKE AMIXED TAPE IN THAT WHEN I WAS
DONE WITH IT, I CALLED MY OLDGIRLFRIEND FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
>> THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION.
>> Jon: WHO WAS -- AND YOU GOTTHE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH
MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS,OBVIOUSLY NOT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.
>> NO.
COULD NOT GET THROUGH HERPEOPLE.
>> Jon: NO, YOU COULD NOT.
HOW DID YOU GET -- YOU WOULDJUST CONTACT SOMEONE AND SAY MY
NAME IS NICK OFFERMAN AND IADMIRE YOU.
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK IN GEORGESAUNDERS' CHAPTER, IT LAYS OUT
THE FORM EMAIL I WOULD SEND THATSAYS I'M WRITING THIS BOOK, IT'S
THIS AND THIS, I WOULD LIKE TOLIONIZE YOU, THAT WILL
OSTENSIVELY SELL MORE OF YOURBOOKS AND RECORDS.
AND GENERALLY, I HONESTLY TRIEDTO SOLICIT BOTH OPRAH AND
HILLARY CLINTON AND COULD NOTGET THROUGH TO EITHER OF THOSE
TWO HEROS.
BUT THE PEOPLE THAT RESPONDEDWERE REALLY GENEROUS, AND I'M
VERY GRATEFUL TO THEM.
>> Jon: FOR YOU, WHAT WAS THEBIGGEST THRILL?
>> I GUESS TWO OF THEM, WENDELLBARRY, THE KENTUCKY AGRARIAN
WRITER IS KIND OF MY GREATESTHERO.
I REALLY ADMIRE HIS WORK ANDSENSIBILITY.
>> Jon: VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDYET POETIC.,
>> YEAH, AND I KIND OF DIDN'TWANT TO BUG HIM BECAUSE PART OF
HIS WRITING IS I JUST STAY ON MYFARM AND WRITE ABOUT HOW DUMB WE
ALL  ARE, IN A VERY MOVING ANDFUNNY WAY.
BUT HE GENEROUSLY, HE AND HISWIFE SAT DOWN WITH ME FOR AN
AFTERNOON, AND ALSO LORIEANDERSON, THE GREAT PERFORMANCE
ARTIST, MUSICIAN, SHE'S SOMEBODYI'VE ADMIRED FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS,
AND SHE HAS A SORT OF CACHET --IT'S LIKE TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF
DAVID BOWIE WHERE YOU'RE, LIKE,CAN WE JUST GET A SANDWICH AND I
CAN ASK YOU STUFF ABOUT YOURVIOLINS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THERE IS A MYTHOLOGYABOUT ICONS LIKE THAT, THAT YOU
DON'T IMAGINE THEY EATSANDWICHES.
YOU'D EAT A SANDWHICH, BUT THEYGET A SMALL TUBE OR SOMETHING.
THEY'D BE GETTING LITTLECREATIVE LIQUID -- MM, MM, MM --
>> YEAH, SHE SEEMS LIKE SHEWOULD BE FED ELECTRONICALLY.
SHE'S REALLY INTO HER GEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AND IT WAS --
YOU WOULD SPEND SOME TIME WITHTHEM AND WRITE ABOUT -- OTHER
THAN GUMPTION, WHAT'S THE THINGYOU THINK TIES IT TOGETHER?
BECAUSE IN MY MIND, IT'S THOSETHAT TOOK THEIR VERY ECCENTRIC
AND UNIQUE ABILITIES ANDATTEMPTED TO ACTUALLY MAKE
THINGS BETTER FOR PEOPLE.
>> KIND OF, YEAH.
THEY ALL ARE THE EPITOME OF GOODART TO ME.
AND WENDELL BARRY PUTS IT VERYWELL.
HE SAYS IT'S PEOPLE WHO SEE THEWORK THAT NEEDS DOING, AND THEY
DO IT.
TO ME, THE BOOK REMINDS ME, ASWELL AS HOPEFULLY MY READERSHIP,
TO JUST GET OFF MY ASS.
WE'RE SO COMFORTABLE THESE DAYSWE COULD SAY, WELL, MAYBE I,
SHOULD JUST BINGE WATCH ALLTHESE GREAT ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS
THE REST OF MY LIFE AND THAT'S ACHOICE WE CAN MAKE AND GET AWAY
WITH.
BUT THAT'S DEPRESSING, AND THENI DRINK TOO MUCH LIQUOR.
I WOULD SAY, YEAH, WHAT'S THATBOOK I WROTE?
I SHOULD MAKE MORE TABLES.
>> Jon: THAT, MY FRIEND -- ISHOULD MAKE MORE TABLES.
BY THE WAY, GEORGE NAKASHIMA ISIN THIS, TOO.
YOU SAT DOWN WITHHER, MIRA, HIS DAUGHTER, WHO
STILL MAKES SUCH BEAUTIFULTABLES.
>> IN A WAY, I THINK SHE'S TAKEN HIS FURNITURE OPERATION AND
TAKEN IT UP A FEW NOTCHES.
>> Jon :NEXT LEVEL.
YOU'RE SO LIKE RON SWANSON, IT'SCRAZY.
>> HE DOESN'T GIGGLE AS MUCH ASI DO.
>> Jon: YOU'RE BOTH ADORABLE.
