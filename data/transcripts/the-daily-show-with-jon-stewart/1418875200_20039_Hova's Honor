AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
I SOLD CRACK TO ADDICTS WHOWERE KILLING THEMSELVES,
COLLECTING THE WRINKLEDBILLS THEY GOT FROM GOD

WHY WOULD THE GOVERNOR PICKHIM?
HE CAN'T DO BETTER THAN THEFORMER CRACK DEALER?

>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT,I'M JUST --
>> BUT ARE YOU RIGHT, JON.HOVA HAS DONE QUITE A FEW
OTHER THINGS SINCE HISDEALING DAYS. YOU THINK THAT
WOULD HAVE IMPRESSED PEOPLE ONFOX BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH
THEY LIKE TO PREACH TO BLACKFOLKS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY
AND SELF-IMPROVEMENT ANDABOUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE
BLACK COMMUNITY.
>> BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO STEPUP AND START ACTING LIKE
FIRST CLASS CITIZENS.
>> TO DAVID'S POINT WHAT HEWAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY,THERE SIMPLY IS NO FATHER IN THE
FAMILY.
>> YOU HAD ME ON THE FACTTHAT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO
CLEAN UP THEIR OWNCOMMUNITIES.
>> WHAT HE NEVER MENTIONED WASTHE OUT OF WEDLOCK BIRTH
RATE IS OVER 70%.
>> THE DESERTION RATE FORAFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN,
ASTRONOMICAL.
>> THIS PRESIDENT COULD BE APHENOMENAL ROLE MODEL WITHIN
THE AFRICAN-AMERICANCOMMUNITY TO SAY GET MARRIED,
STAY MARRIED, BE THERE FORYOUR KIDS.
>> THEY NEED TO STAY OUT OFTROUBLE WITH THE LAW.
THEY NEED TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLEWITH THE LAW,
THEY NEED TO PULL UP THEIRPANTS AND FINISH SCHOOL.
>> I MEAN, LOOK, JON, IF YOUGO OVER THEIR BLACK MALE TO
DO LIST JAY Z HAS IT COVERED.
GOOD JOB, CHECK, STABLEMARRIAGE, CHECK.
I MEAN, YEAH, I MEAN SURE IT HASITS UPS AND DOWNS, KIND OF LIKE
AN ELEVATOR.

AND HE'S NOT JUST PULLINGHIS PANTS UP, THE GUY
ACTUALLY SELLS BELTS.
THAT'S HOW DEVOTED HE IS TOTHE CAUSE OF RAISED PANTS!
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: IT'S TRUE.
>> JON, JAY Z IS THE GUYTHEY KEEP SAYING THEY WANT
ALL OTHER BLACK GUYS TO BE.
BUT TO THEM HE'S STILL JUSTA CRACK DEALER.
>> Jon: AND IT IS APPALLING. ANDHIS WIFE IS THIS POWERHOUSE --
>> OKAY, STOP. NO, STOP, YOUHAVE
NOTHING TO ADD ABOUT HER.
DO NOT BRING HER INTO THIS.
THE ONLY THING I CAN IMAGINEIS THAT FOX HAS A NEW RULE
WHERE PEOPLE MUST BE LABELEDACCORDING TO THE WORST THING
THEY'VE EVER DONE.
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THENWE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX SOME
CHYRONS ON FOX NEWS. SO LET'SSTART WITH OJ DETECTIVE MARK
FUHRMAN, HE HAD HAS BEEN ONFOX A LOT SINCE FERGUSON BUT
THEY ALWAYS FORGET TO LABELHIM PROPERLY.
AND WHAT ABOUT RUSH LIMBAUGH,THE CONSERVATIVE PATRON
SAINT? HE IS NOT JUST ARADIO HOST NOW.
HE IS A PRESCRIPTION DRUGADDICT.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW IT SEEMSHARDLY FAIR TO DO THIS, THOUGH?
>> WHY NOT?
>> Jon: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'SFINE.
(APPLAUSE)>> AND REMEMBER, JON,
THEY'RE CALLING JAY Z ACRACK DEALER NOT BECAUSE HE
WAS CONVICTED.
HE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT INHIS MUSIC SO, BY THAT
STANDARD THEN THEIR BOY TEDNUGENT DEFINITELY NEEDS A NEW
CREDIT.
(LAUGHTER)WE KNOW, WE KNOW THAT OLLIE
NORTH DID TERRIBLE THINGSFOR REAGAN AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO THIS BALD MOTHER[BLEEP] IS BUT HE CLEARLY HAS A
RAP SHEET LONGER THAN ANYRAPPERS.
