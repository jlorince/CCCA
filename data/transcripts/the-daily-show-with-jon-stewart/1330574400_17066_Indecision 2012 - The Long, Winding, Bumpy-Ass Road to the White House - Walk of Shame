>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW" .N MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, MASHA GESSEN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT IS A CLUED IN AUDIENCE, MY
FRIENDS.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND, YOU
KNOW, SOME SEXY PICTURES IN
THERE.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY
THE BOOK.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
LONG WINDING BUMPY ASS ROAD TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.
YESTERDAY ANOTHER PRIMARY NIGHT.
SO AT 9:00 P.M. THE POLLS CLOSED
AND I TUNED IN FOR THE LATEST
RESULTS.
>> POLLS CLOSING.
SEVEN SECONDS AND WE CAN MAKE A
CALL IN THREE SECONDS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: CHIH SECONDS?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THREE SECOND?
WHO'S GOT THAT TIME!
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT.
TWITTER ALREADY TOLD ME WHO WON
THE 2016 ELECTION.
(LAUGHTER)
CONGRATULATIONS, GATT TKPWA.
(LAUGHTER)
GAGA.
I'M KIDDING.
TELL US THE RESULTS.
>> WE AT FOX NEWS CAN PROJECT
THAT MITT ROMNEY WILL EASILY WIN
ARIZONA.
>> Jon: YES, ROMNEY WINS
ARIZONA BY 9:00!
FINALLY A PRIMARY NIGHT THAT
ENDS EARLY.
GOING TO BED WITHOUT HAVING TO
WAIT UP AND THINK ABOUT ALL
THE...
>> IN MICHIGAN, ROMNEY'S NATIVE
STATE, HE HOLDS A SLIGHT LEAD
OVER SANTORUM BUT IT'S TOO EARLY
TO PROJECT.
>> Jon: MICHIGAN!
(LAUGHTER)
OH, I'M MICHIGAN!
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SLOW IN MY PRIMARY RESULTS!
I'M YOUR UPPER PENINSULA.
(LAUGHTER)
I GOT MY RESULTS IN EARLY.
YOU'RE NOT DENSELY POPULATED!
WELL YOU'RE NOT DENSELY...
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: FOR YOU KIDS AT HOME
THAT DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST
HAPPENED, MY HAND JUST
(BLEEP)ED.
(LAUGHTER)
YES, AS IT TURNED OUT, MICHIGAN
WAS NOT CALLED UNTIL WELL AFTER
10:30 P.M. WHICH MEANT THE
24-HOUR NETWORKS HAD SOME TIME
ON THEIR HANDS.
OF COURSE, BEING SERIOUS NEWS
NETWORKS AND REALIZING IN THE
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS A NEAR
TIE IN A STATE PRIMARY THAT
ASSIGNS DELEGATES
PROPORTIONATELY ISN'T ALL THAT
IMPORTANT, THEY FILLED THAT TIME
WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTS ON SYRIA
AND THE GEOPOLITICAL
RAMIFICATIONS OF THE
INCIPIENT... I'M (BLEEP)ING
WITH
YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY JUST KILLED TIME.
>> WE GOT SOME VOTES COMING IN
FROM MICHIGAN RIGHT NOW.
VERY, VERY EARLY THE PROCESS,
ONLY 1% OF THE VOTE NOW IN.
BUT IT'S JUST CHANGED!
>> IN MICHIGAN... I KNOW MEGAN
DOESN'T LIKE TO CALL IT HIS HOME
STATE BUT THE MAN WAS BORN
THERE.
>> NATIVE STATE.
>> SOMETHING WE HAVE FIRST ON
CNN RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SCREEN...
>> I WAS BORN IN ILLINOIS, THAT
IS MY NATIVE STATE.
BUT IT'S NOT MY HOME STATE.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
>> ALL THE INFORMATION IS COMING
THROUGH THOSE PARTICULAR LINES
ERE THOSE RED BULBS ARE.LINESWH
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE'VE JUMPED THE SHARK.
IT'S OFFICIAL.
>> 18,397 FOR ROMNEY BUT, LOOK
IT JUST CHANGED!
(LAUGHTER)
>> OH, MY GOD, IT JUST CHANGED!
THE ELECTION BOARD!
BLITZER, DO YOU HAVE NO
SHORT-TERM MEMORY?
YOU JUST TOLD US THE VOTES ARE
GOING TO BE CHANGING ALL NIGHT
AND THEN YOU TURNED AROUND AND
WET "OH!
IT CHANGED!" LAST TIME I SAW
SOMEONE THIS EXCITED ABOUT
NUMBERS CHANGING IS A VAMPIRE
MADE OUT OF FELT.
AT LEAST SOME CNN ANCHORS CHOSE
TO KILL TIME THE OLD-FASHIONED
WAY-- A LEISURELY STROLL TO THE
CUBE.
>> LET'S GO OVER TO THE CUBE TO
OUR POLITICAL DIRECTOR MARK AND
CHECK IN WITH HIM, GET A SENSE
OF WHEN WE MAY BE ABLE TO
PROJECT AN ACTUAL WINNER IN THE
STATE OF MICHIGAN NOW THAT
OBVIOUSLY THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED
AND WE'VE GOT SON MANY VOTES IN.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: SO CNN'S CUBE, OR NERD
TERRARIUM, IF YOU WILL, IS POP
YOU LATED WITH INDIVIDUALS ON
HEADSETS, YET TO GET INFORMATION
FROM THEM YOU MUST PACK SOME
GORP AND HIKE THE CANYON.
(LAUGHTER)
I THINK COOP'S THE ONLY GUY OVER
THERE FIT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE
JOURNEY.
I ASSUME THE TREK WAS WORTH
ANDERSON'S WHILE.
>> WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?
>> WE GOT SOME BREAKING NEWS OUT
OF MICHIGAN RIGHT NOW, ANDER
SON.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO WIN
MICHIGAN AND A BULK OF THE
DELEGATES.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: YOU BETTER BE GOING
SOMEWHERE WITH THIS, POINDEXTER.
>> WE CAN NOW BASED UPON OUR
CALCULATIONS FROM WHAT OUR
DECISION TEAM HAS FOUND OUT IS
AWARD THREE DELEGATES NOT ONLY
TO MITT ROMNEY BUT ALSO TO RICK
SANTORUM.
>> SO THEY EACH GET THREE AT
THIS POINT.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: COOPER ADDED "DON'T
EVER (BLEEP)ING CALL KNOW THE
CUBE AGAIN, UNDERSTAND ME?"
NEVER.
SO NOTHING'S CHANGED.
BUT HERE COMES MY FAVORITE PART.
>> I WANT TO CHECK IN ALSO WITH
OUR CONTRIBUTORS, OUR ANALYSTS
ABOUT THE DELEGATE COUNT.
>> Jon: ANDERSON COOPER NOW
HAS TO DO THE POST-CUBE NO
INFORMATION WALK OF SHAME BACK
TO THE BASE CAMP!
WHAT WAS CNN THINKING WITH THAT
ONE?
(LAUGHTER)
TO FIND OUT, LET'S CHECK IN WITH
THE BEST (BLEEP)ING NEWS BOX ON
TELEVISION.
WHAT WE DID IS WE HAD... NO, WE
HAD OUR ENGINEERS PUT TOGETHER
WHAT WE CALL A CONVEX
POLYHEDRON.
THEY PUT TOGETHER, SOME OF THE
ANALYTICS ARE THERE WHERE PEOPLE
GO AND THEN THEY WALK IT DOWN...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
AS THEY GO THROUGH TO GET... AND
THEN WE GO... OVER HERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND I'M IN A BOX.
OKAY.
THIS WAY.
AND THEN WE COME DOWN IN.
OKAY.
WE'RE AT THE NEWS CENTER RIGHT
NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
DO YOU GUYS... OBVIOUSLY A LOT
OF DATA IS COMING THROUGH.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY INFORMATION
FOR ME THAT MIGHT CLARIFY THESE
ELECTION RESULTS IN MICHIGAN
LAST NIGHT THIS BIG PRIMARY?
>> NO.
>> NO WE HAVE NOTHING.
>> I HAVE NOTHING.
NO.
>> Jon: THANKS, GUYS,
APPRECIATE IT.
WE'LL CHECK IN OUR POLYHEDRON A
LITTLE LATER.
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
THANKS, GUYS.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
