[APPLAUSE][CHEERING]
>> Jon: HELLO,EVERYBODY.
I'M JON STEWART, AND BOYDID WE PUT ON A PROGRAM
FOR YOU TONIGHT, OUR GUEST MR.BOB ODENKIRK AND
MR. DAVID CROSS.
I'M VERY EXCITED.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT, OFCOURSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
ADDRESS ON SYRIA.
I'M KIDDING AROUND.
THAT'S NOT THE BIG STORY.
THE BIG NEWS LAST NIGHTWAS NOT SYRIA, BUT THE RESULTS
OF NEW YORK'S MAYORALPRIMARY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.
PUBLIC ADVOCATE BILL DE BLASIOWON THE NIGHT WITH THE HELP
OF HIS INCREDIBLY AWESOME FAMILY.
>> THEY'RE BLOWING KISSESTO THE CROWD.
A VERY PHOTOGENIC FAMILY.
>> Jon: THEY'RE A PHOTOGENICFAMILY? I RARELY SAY
THIS ABOUT THE MEDIA, BUTYOU'RE UNDERSELLING IT.
PHOTOGENIC DOESN'T GOANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THESE
FOLKS ARE.
CHECK OUT THIS VICTORY PARTYMOVE THEY PULLED.
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,AND NOW THE SMACKDOWN.
>> Reporter: THE ENTIRE DEBLASIO
FAMILY, INCLUDING SONDANTE AND DAUGHTER KIARA
DID A WEIRD GYMNASTIC MOVETHAT BROUGHT HUGE CHEERS
FROM THE CROWD.
[APPLAUSE][LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ADOPT ME.
YES, SOMEHOW AFTER 12YEARS OF CAPTAIN SODA
NARC, I THINK NEW YORKCITY MIGHT BE READY FOR A
CHARISMATIC BIRACIALFAMILY WITH THEIR OWN
SYNCHRONIZED DANCE MOVES,THAT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN
BEAMED HERE FROM THE1970s MUSIC VARIETY
SPECIAL.
WHO IS BETTER THAN THISFAMILY?
NOBODY IS BETTER THAN THISFAMILY.
YOU'VE GOT KIARA, THECONFIDENT DAUGHTER.
YOU'VE GOT DANTE, THE SONWHO IS SO CHARMING AND SO
CHARISMATIC.
I MEAN, HE ISUNBELIEVABLE.
[LAUGHTER][CHEERING]
[APPLAUSE]>> Jon: HOW DID HE DO
THAT?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: JUST BY WATCHING
HIM, IT SPROUTED.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
OH!
THAT IS TRULYDISAPPOINTING.
OH, LOOK EVERYBODY.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
[CHEERING]>> HEY, TURN THAT DOWN!
TURN THAT DOWN!
[BLEEP][LAUGHTER]
[BOOING]>> Jon: AND FORGET ABOUT
ALL OF THAT, THERE IS HISWIFE, CHIRLANE MCCRAY, WHO, AND
THIS IS TRUE, UNTIL SHE MET HERHUSBAND WAS AN AVOWED
LESBIAN, WHICH WE KNOWFROM HER 1979 ESSENCE MAGAZINE
ARTICLE, "I AM A LESBIAN."
THIS IS WHY DE BLASIO CANWIN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. THE
DEMOCRATS LOVEHIM BECAUSE HE IS AN
OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORKPROGRESSIVE, AND THE
REPUBLICANS LOVE HIM,BECAUSE HE CAN TURN GAY
PEOPLE STRAIGHT.
WHAT'S BETTER THAN THAT?
