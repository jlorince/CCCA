(LAUGHTER)
NATIONAL SECURITY OVERREACH?
WHAT OTHER GROUPS HAVE THE FEDS
PRIORITIZED FOR SCRUTINY?
>> COMPUTER HACKER WHO BROKE
INTO ONLINE ACCOUNTS OF
CHRISTINA AGUILERA SENTENCE
MONDAY TO TEN YEARS IN PRISON.
>> MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ARE RIGHT
NOW CRACKING DOWN ON LEGAL
DISPENSARIES.
>> A SECOND MAN ACCUSED OF
HACKING AT&T SERVERS AND
STEALING DATA NOW FACING
CONSPIRACY AND IDENTITY THEFT
CHARGES.
>> THE F.B.I. GOING AFTER
HACKERS.
MORE THAN 40 SEARCH WARRANTS ON
USPECTS WHO MAY HAVE HACKEDS
INTO MASTERCARD, VISA, AND
PAYPAL.
>> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND
PROSECUTORS SAY A HACKER USED
THE INFO SABOTAGE A STORY ON THE
"L.A. TIMES" WEB SITE.
HE COULD GET UP TO 25 YEARS IN
PRISON.
>> Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP)?
(LAUGHTER)
SO THAT'S WHAT THE D.O.J. IS UP
TO.
THEY'RE GOING AFTER POT HEADS
AND HACKERS.
BASICALLY IF YOU COULD BE PLAYED
IN THE MOVIE BY KEVIN SMITH --
(LAUGHTER).
-- THE FEDS WOULD LIKE A WORD
WITH YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
SO AT THIS POINT --
(APPLAUSE).
AT THIS POINT ADMINISTRATION
PRIORITIES SEEM TO BE TILTED
TOWARDS UNUSUALLY HARSH
PUNISHMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS
WHOSE CRIMES DON'T REALLY SEEM
TO MERIT THEM.
HAVE THEY HAD ANYTHING TO OFFER
ON SLIGHTLY LARGER FISH?
>> LET ME MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT THERE IS NO BANK, THERE'S
NO INSTITUTION, THERE'S NO
INDIVIDUAL WHO CANNOT BE
INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED BY
THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE.
>> Jon: YES!
THE INSTITUTIONS THAT NEARLY
BROKE THE WORLD.
HOW'S THAT BANK PROSECUTION
GOING, BY THE WAY?
>> MORE THAN FOUR YEARS SINCE
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008,
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS OF
THINK SENIOR WALL STREET
EXECUTIVES.
>> Jon: NO ARRESTS.
YOU SEE HOW SAD THAT MADE THE
VOICEOVER GUY?
(LAUGHTER)
(AS VOICEOVER GUY)
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS AS
ANYBODY!
WHY NOT?
WHY HAVEN'T YOU ARRESTED THOSE
GUYS?
NONE OF THEM BOUGHT POT?
AND IF THEY DIDN'T BUY POT
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY BLEW
ALL THEIR MONEY ON COCAINE!
(LAUGHTER)
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE AFTER THEM?
WHAT ARE THEY TOO BIG TO JAIL?
>> LET ME BE VERY, VERY, VERY
CLEAR: BANKS ARE NOT TOO BIG TO
JAIL IF WE FIND A BANK OR A
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT HAS
DONE SOMETHING WRONG, IF WE CAN
PROVE IT BEYOND A REASONABLE
DOUBT, THOSE CASES WILL BE
BROUGHT.
>> Jon: BEAUTIFUL.
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN HOLDER'S
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRODUCED A
30-PAGE DOCUMENT SAYING
EXPLICITLY THAT IT COULD PROVE
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT
H.S.B.C. VIOLATED FEDERAL MONEY
LAWS BY FAILING TO MONITOR OVER
$220 TRILLION IN WIRE TRANSFERS
IT MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO --
STRIKE A DEAL ALLOWING THEM PAY
A FINE EQUAL TO ONE MONTH'S
PROFITS.
SCARED STRAIGHT!
(LAUGHTER)
SO THAT'S WHAT WE FIGURED OUT TO
DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, TAX FRAUD.
HAY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHAT
OUTSIDE EXPERTS TOLD YOU ABOUT
HOW MUCH DAMAGE PROSECUTING
THESE BIG BANKS WOULD DO.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS
NOT RECEIVED ANY MATERIAL
INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE EXPERTS
WHEN MAKING PROSECUTORIAL
DECISIONS IN CASES INVOLVING
LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
>> FIRST OF ALL --
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-- I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO
LEAVE YOUR PROM TO COME TO DO
THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SECOND OF ALL, SO THEY
DIDN'T EVEN GET INFORMATION
ABOUT WHAT TWO BIG TO JAIL EVEN
MEANS?
TOO BIG TO JAIL WAS REALLY TOO
HARD TO KNOW?
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
NOT ONE PERSON WENT TO PRISON
FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE WHOLE
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
ISN'T THERE ANYBODY?
JUST ONE GUY?
>> CHARLIE ENGEL WENT TO PRISON
FOR HIS ROLE IN THE FINANCIAL
CRISIS.
>> Jon: WHAT IS WITH THE
(BLEEP)ING BOW TIE?
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, THANK YOU.
WHO IS CHARLIE ENGEL?
WHAT IS HE SOME WALL STREET
WHEELER DEALER BIG-TIME BANKER?
>> HE DIDN'T WORK HERE ON WALL
STREET.
HE WAS NOT A BIG-TIME BANKER.
HE WAS CONVICTED OF DOING
SOMETHING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF OTHER AMERICANS LIKELY DID
DURING THE HOUSING BOOM: HE
EXAGGERATED HIS INCOME ON HIS
MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS.
>> Jon: PRIORITIES U.S.A.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
