RECORDING.
(LAUGHTER) OF COURSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED PEER PRESSURE, SOMETIMES YOU CAN
BEND AMERICANS TO YOUR WILL WITH BRUTE FORCE AS WHAT HAPPENED TO AN ICON IN LONDON.
>> BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, PAUL McCARTNEY.
OVER THE WEEKEND THEY THRILLED FANS AT A CONCERT IN LONDON.
THAT IS UNTIL ORGANIZERS PULLED THE PLUG (AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: YOU (BLEEP)ED WITH THE WRONG DUDE.
(LAUGHTER) THEY CUT SPRINGSTEEN'S MIC THREE HOURS INTO THE SHOW?
THAT'S HALF TIME!
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
>> APPARENTLY THE FOLKS WHO LIVE HERE IN THE AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDING HYDE
PARK WHO HAVE DEMANDED A NOISE CURFEW AND THIS CONCERT HAD GONE PAST THE TIME LIMIT PROMPTING
SOMEONE TO SHUT THEM DOWN.
>> Jon: OH, IT WAS ANGRY OLD RICH PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) CAME OUT OF THEIR HOUSES AND WENT "YOU KIDS!
TURN DOWN THAT!" OH, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE 70.
I DIDN'T REALIZE.
(LAUGHTER) LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
ENGLAND, NOBODY PUTS BRUCEY IN A CORNER!
SPRINGSTEEN GETS TO SING AS LONG AS HE WANTS AS LOUD AS HE WANTS
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO... CAN DO...
BE WHAT'S THIS?
>> BE QUIET, JON!
BE QUIET!
KEEP IT DOWN.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> IT'S NIGHT, JON.
BRITAIN HAS GOT THE OLYMPICS COMING UP.
WE NEED OUR REST!

>> WHICH EVENTS?
JAVELIN AND SYNCHRONIZED SINKING.

SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.
>> REALLY.
(BLEEP) THERE GOES ONE BRONZE.
LOOK, YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD.
CUT HIS MIC.
CUT HIS MIC NOW.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU DARE!
>> CUT IT!
YOU BE QUIET NOW.
YOU BE QUIET!
NO, BE QUIET!
YOU'VE BEEN TOO NOISY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NO, NO, NO.
>> Jon: THIS IS AMERICA.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> Jon: WE DON'T LET BRITISH PEOPLE TELL US HOW LOUD WE CAN BE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A LITTLE BIT BREEZYN'T N HERE,
ISN'T IT, OLIVER?
WHO THE HELL DO YOU PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE CUTTING OFFSPRING AND SEEN THE'S MIC?
HE'S THE BOSS.
>> OH, YEAH, WELL, WE HAVE THE QUEEN, JON.
THE ACTUAL QUEEN.
AND YOU DO NOT KEEP HER UP PAST HER BEDTIME.
>> Jon: OH (BLEEP)
>> LET ME TELL YOU...
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) IT'S GETTING REAL NOW.
JON, LET ME TELL YOU....
>> Jon: ♪ ♪ (SINGING)
>> IF SHE DOESN'T GET 15 HOURS UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP SHE'S A (BLEEP)ING MONSTER!
SO YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!
>> Jon: ♪ COME TAKE MY HANDS ♪
>> KEEP IT DOWN!
>> Jon: IF THE QUEEN EVER COMES TO NEW JERSEY, BUDDY...
>> OH, JON, THE QUEEN IS NEVER COMING TO NEW JERSEY.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHY NOT?
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY, JON, BECAUSE THE QUEEN IS A LADY WHO HAS NO BUSINESS ASSOCIATING HERSELF
WITH HUMAN FILTH.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: I HEAR OTHERWISE.
LISTEN, IF SHE DID, WE'D NEVER TURN HER T MIC OFF.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA.
WE'RE ABOUT FREEDOM.
ONE NATION INDWIZABLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
AND THAT FREEDOM...
>> OH, THAT'S NICE, JON.
FREEDOM?
FREEDOM, REMIND ME, WHAT SOLDIERS ARE YOU ALLOWED?
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: (BLEEP)
>> QUIET!
JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
