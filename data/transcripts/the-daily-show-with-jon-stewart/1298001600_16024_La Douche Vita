>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT PROGRAM FOR
YOU TONIGHT.
THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING HERE
IN... NO?
IT'S LIKE 60 DEGREES OUTSIDE
TODAY, ISN'T IT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THOUGHT IT WAS NICE.
(LAUGHTER)
FORMER R.N.C. CHAIR ED GILLESPIE
IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TODAY
TO ASK WHY WE NEVER MADE A
MUPPET OF HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF I IT.
STEELE WAS SO MUCH MORE OF A
COMPELLING FELT FIGURE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT FIRST, WE'VE ALL BEEN MOVED
BY THE IMAGES FROM THE MIDDLE
EAST, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
NON-AMERICAN FLAG BURNING
CITIZENS CRY OUT FOR NEW
LEADERSHIP.
PEOPLE DRIVEN INTO THE PUBLIC
SQUARE BY YEARS OF REPRESSIVE
RULE.
AND THEN THERE'S ITALY.
>> A DAY OF PROTEST CALLING FOR
AN ENTRENCHED LEADER TO STEP
DOWN.
>> ONE BANNER READS "RESIGN AND
GET YOUR HEAD CHECKED."
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: FINALLY IT APPEARS THE
ITALIAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH
OF SILVIO BERLUSCONI.
THROUGH THREE TERMS AND ABOUT
NINE YEARS AS ITALY'S PRIME
MINISTER, THROUGH A TAX FRAUD
CASE RELATING TO A SPANISH
TELEVISION COMPANY, THROUGH AN
INFLUENCE PEDDLING SCANDAL
CONCERNING CONSTRUCTION
CONTRACTS ARE.
THROUGH ALLEGATION OF BRIBERY,
EMBEZZLEMENT, TIES TO ORGANIZED
CRIME, USING OLIVE OIL THAT WAS
NOT EXACTLY VIRGIN.
(LAUGHTER)
ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE
DE-EMPHASIZED THANKS TO A NEAR
MONOPOLY BERLUSCONI HOLDS ON
ITALY'S NEWS MEDIA AND RENDERED
MOOT ANYWAY BY A LAW BERLUSCONI
PASSED EXEMPTING HIMSELF FROM
PROSECUTION WHILE IN OFFICE.
NOW I KNOW WHY VENICE IS SINKING
IT'S UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SILVIO
BERLUSCONI'S GIANT BALLS.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE GIGANTIC.
I WAS IN ONE OF THEM ONCE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GONDOLA.
(LAUGHTER)
WAIT A MINUTE.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S
PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT APPARENTLY ONLY NOW-- ONLY
NOW-- HAS HE GONE TOO FAR.
>> THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER,
SILVIO BERLUSCONI, WHO COMMENTED
TODAY ON CHARGES HE HAD SEX WITH
AN UNDERAGE PROSECUTE AT ONE OF
HIS BUNGA BUNGA SEX PARTIES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE
PROBABLY FOCUSING ON THE
COMPOUND ADJECTIVE BUNGA-BUNGA.
BUT IF I MAY, I'D LIKE TO DRAW
YOUR ATTENTION TO THE EARLIER
PHRASE "WITH AN UNDERAGE
PROSTITUTE."
WHICH IS ONE OF THE RARE PHRASES
THAT SOUNDS NO MORE ROMANTIC IN
ITS NATURAL ITALIAN.
I BELIEVE THE PHRASE IS
"A-STATUTORIO-RAPE."
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, BERLUSCONI NOW MUST
BE VERY WORRIED.
>> BERLUSCONI DENIES THE CHARGES
IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT ON
THE ISSUE SINCE THE JUDGE'S
ORDER.
HE SAID, AMONG OTHER THINGS, "I
AM NOT WORRIED IN THE LEAST."
>> Jon: WOW.
NOTHING STICKS TO THIS GUY.
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE,
AFTER ALL THE ALLEGATIONS YOU'VE
HEARD ABOUT HIM, IT SEEMS LIKE
HE WOULD BE QUITE STICKY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE GUY'S LIKE CHARLIE SHEEN
WITH DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND INSTEAD OF RAISING HALF A
MAN, HE'S RUNNING ITALY.
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF
BERLUSCONI'S LOVE-AGE FRIENDS
WITH BUNGA FITS.
>> HOW MUCH MONEY DID HE GIVE
YOU?
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THAT'S NOT THE MATTER.
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE SAY IT DOES
MATTER BECAUSE IT WOULD SUGGEST
THAT HE WAS EITHER PAYING FOR
YOUR SERVICES OR PAYING TO KEEP
YOU QUIET.
>> OR HE WAS HELPING ME JUST
BECAUSE HE CARED FOR ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YEAH.
YEAH.
YOU'RE LIKE THE DAUGH
