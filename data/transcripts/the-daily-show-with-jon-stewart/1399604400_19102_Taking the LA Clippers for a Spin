>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
SO, WHEN WE LAST LEFT WE WERETALKING ABOUT THE APPLE MUFFIN.
( LAUGHTER )A WEEK AFTER THE N.B.A. SAID IT
WOULD TRY TO FORCE L.A. CLIPPERSOWNER DONALD STERILING TO SELL
HIS TEAM, THE FRANCHISE HAS NOSHORTAGE OF WEALTHY SUITORS.
>> OPRAH WINFREY SAYS SHE'SINTERESTED IN BUYING THE
CLIPPERS, PARTNERING WITH DAVID
GEFFEN AND ORACLE OWNER LARRYELLISON.
>> THEN THERE'S RAPPERRICK ROSS.
>> SEAN P. DIDDY COMBS.>> FRANKIE MUNIZ.
>> MATT DAMON.
>> EVEN BOXERS, FLOYDMAYWEATHER, OSCAR DELA HOYA.
>> MAGIC JOHNSON CONFIRMING HE'SA POTENTIAL BUYER AS WELL.
>> Jon:  WOW, THAT IS ANECLECTIC GROUP OF INVESTORS.
OR THE WEIRDEST AWARD SHOWLINEUP EVER.
LIKE A RANDOM CELEBRITYNAME GENERATOR.
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEALTHYDILETTANTE IN AMERICA WANTS TO
BUY THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS.NOW,
>> AREN'T YOU FORGETTINGSOMEONE, JON?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon: DERANGED MILLIONAIRE
JOHN HODGMAN.
>> YES, THAT'S RIGHT. AND ITHINK I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE L.A.
CLIPPERS FOR A SPIN. ( LAUGHTER )
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
>> Jon:  COME AND SIT DOWN.
>> OKAY.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU TRYING TOBUY THE CLIPPERS FROM 1972?
>> OH, I LIKE TO GET,
I LIKE TO LET THE BOYSBREATHE, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT.
>> OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE TO BUY THECLIPPERS, JON, BECAUSE I,
OBVIOUSLY, OWN THE CALVESALREADY.
>> OOOOOH!
>> Jon:  I HOPE WE WHITEBALANCE THE SCREEN TONIGHT
BECAUSE OF THAT.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> I'M BLOWING OUT FLAT SCREENSALL OVER AMERICA.
>> Jon: YOU ARE BLOWINGOUT-- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SHOULD
TRY AND -- IT'S GRADE ALEG MEAT.
YOU WANT TO MOVE THAT OFF THETHING THERE?
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST INBASKETBALL, IF YOU WILL?
>> OH, I DON'T CARE ABOUTBASKETBALL.
BUT OWNING A SPORTS TEAM IS THELAST REMNANT OF CAPITALISM'S
GOLDEN AGE, WHEN OWNERSCONTROLLED EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR
WORKERS' LIVES AND AS ANOLIGARCH AMERICAN IT'S TIME I
ACQUIRED MY OWN HERD OF HUMANS( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon: YOU, YOU,  I THINK YOUHAVE THE WRONG IDEA HERE.
YOU JUST OWN A TEAM, BUT IT'SNOT, YOU DON'T OWN THE HUMANS.
THEY PLAY ON IT.
>> OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING I AND MYWEALTHY FRIENDS WON'T TAKE TURNS
SELECTING WHICH OF THESE YOUNGMEN WE WANT?
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  AH... TECHNICALLY,
THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO.
THAT'S HOW THE DRAFTWORKS. BUT IT'S NOT--
>> BUT, I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDNEVER ARRANGE A
PUBLIC INSPECTION OF THEIRBODIES' STRENGTH AND
AGILITY. YES OR NO.( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: THEY DO-- THEY DO
SCOUT PLAYERS IN THAT MANNER INSOME REGARD.
>> OH, I SEE. WELL,
OBVIOUSLY, ONCE I DRAFT THEM, IWOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DICTATE
THEIR HOME CITY?
>> Jon:  YOU PROBABLY WOULD BEABLE TO DICTATE THEIR HOMECITY.
>> OK, SO TO RECAP I TAKE THEMFROM THEIR HOMES AND COMPEL THEM
TO PERFORM PHYSICAL FEATS FOR MYPLEASURE AND PROFIT IN A PLACE
OF MY CHOOSING AND WHEN ITIRE OF THEM I CAN TRADE
THEM WITH MY WEALTHY FRIENDSWITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.
IS THAT RIGHT, JON?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  YOU KNOW, THIS IS
REALLY-- THIS IS REALLY WHY I'MNOT SURE YOU'RE THE BEST
CANDIDATE TO MOVE THE CLIPPERS,PAST THE LEGACY OF DONALD
STERLING.
>> MOVE PAST THE LEGACY? WHYWOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?
>> Jon:  WELL, HE'S A RACISTAND BEING STRIPPED OF HIS TEAM
IN DISGRACE.
>> A TEAM THAT HE BOUGHT FOR $12MILLION THAT HE'S NOW BEING
FORCED TO SELL FOR OVER HALF ABILLION DOLLARS.
JON, THAT'S NOT DISGRACE.
THAT'S A BUSINESS MODEL. AND, ICAN DO BETTER.
IF HE CAN MAKE HALF A BILLION BYBEING SECRETLY RACIST, IMAGINE
HOW MUCH MORE I'LL MAKE WITH THECLIPPERS BY BEING OPENLY RACIST.
>> Jon: NO, I DON'T, I DON'T, IDON'T THINK YOUR MOSTLY BLACK
BASKETBALL TEAM IS GOING TOAPPRECIATE THAT STANCE.
>> OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM.I'M GOING TO FIRE ALL THE BLACK
PLAYERS. DAY ONE.
I'M TAKING THE CLIPPERS ALLWHITE.
>> Jon:  SORRY, SAY THATAGAIN?
>> ALL WHITE. YOU KNOW.LIKE MITT ROMNEY BUYING
MAYONNAISE ON HIS WAY TO ACOLDPLAY CONCERT.
>> Jon:  I THINK IF YOUDO THAT TO THE LOS ANGELES
CLIPPERS, LOS ANGELES WILL TEARYOU APART.
>> OH, JON I'LLALREADY BE LONG GONE.

CAUCASIAN BASKETBALL.

THEIR SKIN COLOR BUT WHITESCAN'T?
WELL, THAT'S REVERSE RACISM,JON.
THAT'S OFFENSIVE.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon: REDSKINS AREN'T THENATIVE AMERICANS' TEAM AND THEY
REALLY DON'T LIKE THE NAME, SOIT'S NOT.
>> WELL, MAYBE THEYWOULD LIKE IT MORE IF
THEY HAD A LOVEABLE MASCOT LIKEOURS. MEET SKINNY THE SKINHEAD.
