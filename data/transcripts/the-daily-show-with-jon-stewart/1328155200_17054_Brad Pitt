( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT,
AN ACTOR NOMINATED FOR AN
ACADEMY AWARD FOR HIS WORK IN
"MONIED BALL."
>> IF WE DON'T WIN THE LAST GAME
OF THE SERIES, THEY'LL DISMISS
US.
>> I KNOW THESE GUYS.
I KNOW THE WAY THEY THINK.
AND THEY WILL ERASE US.
AND EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE HERE,
NONE OF IT WILL MATTER.
ANY OTHER TEAM WINS THE WORLD
SERIES, GOOD FOR THEM.
THEY'RE DRINKING CHAMPAGNE.
THEY GET A RING.
BUT IF WE WIN, ON OUR BUDGET
WITH THIS TEAM, WE'LL CHANGE THE
GAME.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT'S
AMAZING?
JONAH HILL DOESN'T TALK IN THAT
ENTIRE MOVIE.
JUST SITS THERE BLINKING.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,
BRAD PITT N!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )
>> Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING FUNNY?
THEY NEVER GET TIRED OF SEEING
ME.
IT'S WEIRD.
THEY NEVER GET-- IT'S THE--
EVERY TIME WE COME BACK FROM
COMMERCIAL, IT'S THAT.
>> I'M HAVING THE SAME REACTION.
>> Jon:  ISN'T IT HARD
SOMETIMES?
>> VERY.
>> Jon:  HOW ARE YOU DOING?
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> DOING ALL RIGHT, DOING ALL
RIGHT, THANKS.
>> Jon:  THIS "MONEYBALL."
YOU HAVE TWO FILMS NOMINATED FOR
BEST PICTURE, YES.
>> YES, THIS AND "TREE OF LIFE."
>> Jon:  BUT YOU ARE
NOMINATED AS AN ACTOR IN
"MONEYBALL."
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Jon:  SO WE CAN TALK
ABOUT "MONEYBALL" AND NOT "TREE
OF LIFE" BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.
I'VE SEEN IT FIVE TIMES AND I'M
HONING IN ON WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
>> LET'S DO "MONEYBALL."
>> Jon:  THIS MOVIE WAS NOT
GOING TO BE MADE.
WHAT MADE YOU STAY WITH US?
>> WE DEVELOPED-- TO DEVELOP A
STORY THAT HAS ECONOMICS AND
SCIENCE, SABER METRICS AT THE
FRONT, IS A DIFFICULT ENDEAVOR,
SO IT TOOK US A LONG TIME, I
THINK, TO GET IT RIGHT.
BUT IT WAS THE STORY OF THIS
SMALL-MARKET TEAM THAT FOUND THE
GAME UNFAIR.
THEY COULD NOT COMPETE.
THEY COULDN'T BUY THE TALENT.
>> Jon:  THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE MONEY.
>> AND IF THEY DEVELOPED THE
TALENT IT WAS POACHED BY THE
RICH TEAMS SO WHAT WERE THEY
GOING TO DO TO CHALLENGE THEM.
THEY BEGAN QUESTIONING 150 YEARS
OF BASEBALL KNOWLEDGE AND
STARTED WITH THE QUESTION, JUST
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT THIS
WAY FOR SO LONG, DOES THAT MEAN
IT'S RIGHT?   -- I-- EQUATE IT
TO THE AUTOMOBILE.
IF WE INVENTED THE AUTOMOBILE
TODAY WOULD WE INVENT A CAR--
WOULD WE SAY, "I KNOW, WE'LL RUN
IT ON A FINITE FOSSIL FUEL,
EXPORT HAL A TRILLION DOLLARS OF
G.D.P., SPEND HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE
MILITARY TO PROTECT OUR
INVESTMENT AND IT POLLUTES OF
ENVIRONMENT.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
>> Jon:  JUST DO JET PACKS.
>> THAT WOULD BE SERIOUSLY COOL.
>> Jon:  I'M WAITING FOR
THAT THIS SABER METRICS,
THOUGH-- DO YOU THINK THEY'LL
EVER MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT A
BIG-MARKET TEAM THAT HAS THE
MONEY TO SPEND BUT STILL SUCKS?
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S SAY, WE COULD CALL IT
SOMETHING FICTITIOUS, LIKE "THE
METS."
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
ARE YOU-- DID YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND THE ALGORITHMS THAT
THEY USED IN THE SABER METRICS?
>> NO, I ONLY PLAY A GUY WHO
UNDERSTANDS BASEBALL.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  BECAUSE IT IS--
IT'S COMPLICATED.
>> IT IS COMPLICATED WHAT THESE
GUYS ARE BREAKING DOWN.
BUT IN THE OUTCOME, THEY
IDENTIFIED AN ENTIRE POOL OF
TALENT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN
DEVALED, DECOMMISSIONED, AND PUT
TOGETHER A FORMIDABLE TEAM AND
THESE GUYS GOT A SECOND CHANCE
OUT OF IT.
AND IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING
STORY THAT MICHAEL LEWIS SAW IN
'02, SAW THIS HAPPENING AND GOT
IN THERE AND CAPTURED IT.
>> Jon:  ONE OF MY FAVORITE
SCENES IS THE SCOUT, THIS GUY IS
NOT HANDSOME.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE.
LOOK AT HIS GIRLFRIEND.
THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE MAKING
THEIR DECISIONS.
>> THAT CAME-- 30 SCOUTS CAME
AND WE HAD A WOK SHOP AND THEY
GAVE UP THEIR DAY TO KIND OF
SCHOOL US ON IT.
WHAT THE GUY ACTUALLY SAID IS,
"UGLY GIRLFRIEND."
AND A GUY SAID, "WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?"
AND HE SAID, "BAD EYESIGHT."
>> Jon:  WAS THAT THE BEST
DAY HAVING THE SCOUTS AROUND?
>> OH, IT WAS A GREAT DAY, AND
IN FACT, A LOT OF THEM ENDED UP
IN THE SCENES.
THOSE ARE REAL BASEBALL
INSIDERS.
THEY WERE REALLY GRACIOUS TO
COME IN AND PLAY BALL WITH US.
>> Jon:  GRACIOUS TO COME
IN?
THAT'S THE GREATEST DAY OF THEIR
LIVES.
THOSE GUYS SPEND THEIR DAY LIKE
TROLLING FIELDS IN THE MIDWEST.
TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND DO
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOT OF FUN
FOR THEM.
SOME OF THE GUYS LIKE BART HOW,
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE THOSE GUYS
AREN'T SO HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY
IT'S PORTRAYED.
>> FAIR ENOUGH.
>> Jon:  BULL BUTT ALSO THE
As DIDN'T WIN.
THEY DIDN'T WIN THE WORLD
SERIES.
HERE YOU HAVE THIS MOVIE AND
TYPICALLY WITH THE MOVIE IT END
WITH WORLD SERIES, GAME SEVEN,
BOTTOM OF THE NINTH, AND ONE OF
THE GUYS THAT, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY OVERLOOKS KNOCKS ONE--
AND THEY SCORE.
DID THAT EVER COME INTO PLAY
WHERE YOU FELT LIKE ( BLEEP )
LET'S JUST MAKE THE As WORLD
CHAMPIONS?
DID THAT EVER?
>> PUT THE YANKEES IN THERE AND
BEAT THE YANKEES.
>> I THINK THERE WAS SOME
VERSION OF THAT IN THE FIRST
ATTEMPT.
THIS STORY WAS MORE INTERESTING
BECAUSE IT WAS A QUEST FOR VALUE
AND OUR MAIN CHARACTER DOESN'T
WIN-- DOESN'T WIN THE TROPHY BUT
HE DOES FIND A VALUE, HIS OWN
VALUE IN THE PROCESS.
>> Jon:  WHY DON'T OSCAR
MOVIES-- YOU KNOW, WE SEE IT SO
MUCH NOW LIKE WITH THE RACE IN
FLORIDA, WHY DON'T THEY GO
NEGATIVE ON OTHER MOVIES?
THE OSCAR RACE IS ALWAYS, "FOR
YOUR CONSIDERATION,
'MONEYBALL'."
WHY NOT THE ARTISTS LIKE GO
( BLEEP ) YOURSELF?
WHY NOT GO NEGATIVE ON THESE
GUYS.
>> I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
CLOONEY TOOK IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE
HAMPSHIRE.
JON TOOK-- HE TOOK SOUTH
CAROLINA.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> FLORIDA WOULD PROBABLY GO
TOOLEMAN.
I'M GOING TO BE HANGING OUT WITH
RON PAUL SO I HAVE TO GET IN
THERE AND MIX IT UP A BIT, I
THINK.
>> Jon:  SEE, IT'S GOOD THAT
YOU AND I TALK.
BECAUSE IS IT NOT--
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE
SHOULD DO?
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST PUT A
TROVE OAT TABLE AND LIKE ONE OF
THOSE CARD CONTESTS WE SHOULD
ALL PUT OUR HAND ON IT AND SEE
WHO CAN HOLD IT THE LONGEST.
>> Jon:  THAT IS THE MOST
AWESOME IDEA I HAVE EVER HEARD.
>> LAST MAN STANDING TAKES THE
TROPHY.
>> Jon:  THAT'S A TREMENDOUS
IDEA.
>> HANDS ON THE OSCAR.
>> Jon:  WHY ISN'T THAT A
MOVIE RIGHT NOW?
DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NEW
ORLEANS.
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE ABOUT NEW
ORLEANS.
ALL RIGHT BRAD FIT, EVERYBODY.
