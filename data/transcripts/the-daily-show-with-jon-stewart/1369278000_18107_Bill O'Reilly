>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE
HOST-OF-THE-FOX NEWS CHANNEL'S
"THE O'REILLY FACTOR."
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "KEEP IT
PITHY: USEFUL OBSERVATIONS IN A
TOUGH WORLD."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM, BILL O'REILLY.
( APPLAUSE )
I THINK I'M RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
>> YOU KNOW, JUST THE USUAL.
FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENTS GETTING
ARRESTED.
THEY'RE LOOTING THE BUILDING
OVER THERE.
>> Jon:  FINALLY, YOU ARE
RECOGNIZED AS THE ENEMY OF THE
STATE YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon:  I HESITATE TO SAY
THIS, BUT, BOY, IS THAT A
TROUBLING SCANDAL.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS
IS, BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS REALLY
OVER-REACHING WITH JOURNALISTS.
AND THAT IS UPSETTING.
>> JAMES ROSE SEWN HIS WAY TO
GUANTANAMO NOW.
>> Jon:  DO YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE JUMPSUIT?
>> I DO.
>> Jon:  IT IS YOUR FIFTH
BOOK THIS MONTH.
I SWEAR TO GOD--
>> THEY'RE ALL ON THE BESTSELLER
LIST.
>> Jon:  I FEEL LIKE STEPHEN
KING LOOKS AT YOU AND GOES,
"SLOW DOWN, BUDDY."
>> THEY JUST COME OUT.
THIS IS A COMPILATION OF ALL THE
WISDOM THAT HAS COME OUT OF THE
"FACTOR."
SET YOU UP FOR THAT.
>> Jon:  IS THAT ALL ALL THE
WISDOM?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOW IS IT GOING OVER THERE?
SO, SO, FOR 55 YEARS.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  YOU'RE ALWAYS ON
RED ALERT.
THE PRESIDENT SAY SOCIALIST.
HE IS DESTROYING THE COUNTRY.
YOU'RE THROWING EVERYTHING
AGAINST THE WALL, TRYING TO--
MUSLIMS AND THINGS.
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
YOU FINALLY HAVE A FEW THINGS
THAT REALLY LOOK WORTH
INVESTIGATING.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  IS IT-- IS IT JOY?
IS IT SEXUAL AROUSAL?
LIKE-- WHAT IS-- WHAT IS THE
FEELING OVER THERE?
>> LOOK-- I HAVE BEEN TOO EASY
ON THE MAN, AND NOW I'M IT'S
REAL PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM.
"I TOLD YOU!"
THEY'RE GIVING THAT TO ME.
>> Jon:  I KNOW.
>> AND THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE
PRESIDENT JUST SIMPLY DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN HIS
NRGZ.
>> Jon:  DON'T YOU THINK
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE
FOR PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.
>> OF COURSE.
AND I SAID THAT TODAY.
THAT'S NOT ONLY IN POLITICS BUT
IN CORPORATIONS AS WELL.
KEEP IT AWAY FROM HIM, THIS AND
THAT.
BUT THE PRESIDENT SETS A TONE.
LIKE YOU SET A TONE FOR THIS
PROGRAM.
>> Jon:  I APPRECIATE THAT.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WHAT IS IT-- THE ONE-- THE
I.R.S. ONE, DO YOU FEEL LIKE
CONSERVATIVES WERE CLEARLY
SINGLED OUT, BASED ON THEIR
POLITICAL BELIEVES?
>> NO.
IT WAS-- IT'S WHAT THEY ATE FOR
DINNER.
COME ON, OF COURSE THEY DID.
TEA PARTY DOES VERY WELL IN THE
MIDTERMS, RIGHT?
DO THE MATH.
TEA PARTY IS GETTING MOMENTUM.
THEY DO VERY WELL.
THE PRESIDENT LOSES THE HOUSE.
BUM-BUM-BUM.
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN HIS GUYS
START TO SAY WE HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF THE TEA PARTY.
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO TAKE CARE
OF THEM?
SCARE THEM A LITTLE BIT.
AND THEN IT TAKES ON A LIFE OF
ITS OWN.
THIS IS SPECULATION BUT IT'S
EDUCATED SPECULATION, BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT I THINK HAPPENED.
>> YOU'RE PULLING IT OUT OF YOUR
BUTT.
OH, I'M SORRY, LENNY.
>> Jon:  THE HAND MOTION IS
LOWER BUT IT'S FINE.
SO THE FEEL OVER THERE, THAT
THIS--
>> OVER WHERE?
>> Jon:  WHERE YOU WORK?
>> WHERE I WORK.
SAY THE WORD.
>> Jon:  UHTHE--
>> SAY IT.
WHERE DO I WORK?
>> Jon:  WHAT IS THE SHAH'S
SECRET POLICE ORGANIZATION?
WHAT IS THAT?
SO YOU'RE OVER THERE.
>> I'M OVER THERE IN HELL.
>> Jon:  IN HELL, RIGHT.
I'LL SAY THE ORGANIZATION,
SORON.
AND-- SO THERE'S THE SENSE THEY
HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT PURELY
BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL
BELIEFS.
TO BE PROFILED LIKE THAT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  IT MUST BE VERY
UPSET.
>> WELL, WE SET BONFIRES AND
HOMES LIGHT UP.
>> Jon:  JUST TO BE LUMPED
IN WITH PEOPLE BASED SOLELY ON
ONE FACTOR, IS UNFAIR, I GUESS
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
IT'S UNFAIR.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  IT WOULD BE LIKE--
LET'S SAY SOMEBODY COMMITTED AN
ACT OF TERROR, AND WE TOOK THEIR
WHOLE RELIGION.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon:  AND WE LUMPED THEM
ALL IN FOR SPECIAL SINGLING OUT.
>> THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING
ANALOGY.
SO, A, ACT OF TERROR, NOT 14,600
ACTS OF TERROR, ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon:  WELL.
>> I'M JUST DOING THE MATH HERE.
IF THEY KEEP MOUNTING UP, MAYBE
YOU DO A LITTLE PROFILING,
MAYBE.
>> Jon:  SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH
PROFILING AS LONG AS--
>> ONCE IT GETS OVER 14,000 ACTS
OF TERROR, I THINK WE WANT TO
MOVE IN A LITTLE.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT.
SO 14,000 IS THE LIMIT.
>> YOU LEAVE THE BULGARIANS
EXPLOON GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST.
>> Jon:  HOW MANY SHOOTINGS
ARE IN THIS COUNTRY?
>> IN THIS COUNTRY?
>> Jon:  YES.
>> EVERY YEAR?
I'M NOT SURE, HOW MANY.
>> Jon:  30,000 BETWEEN
HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE.
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD START
PROFILING?
>> OF WHO?
DEAD PEOPLE?
>> Jon:  THE PEOPLE WITH THE
GUN.
IT RAISED ABOVE YOURÃ±r 14,000
INCIDENT THRESHOLD IS WHAT I'M
SAYING.
>> HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROFILE
THEM?
WHAT GROUP DO YOU WANT TO ZERO
IN ON, ON THE GUN CRIME.
FOX VIEWERS.
>> Jon:  IS THAT TOO BROAD.
>> NO, I KNOW.
I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU-- DO
WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE QUESTION.
>> Jon:  WE HAVE TIME FOR
MANY.
>> DID THEY FIRE YOU HERE?
>> GL WHAT!
>> ARE YOU GONE?
>> Jon:  NO, I'M LEAVING IN
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
I'M GOING TO A MISSION.
>> I HEARD YOU'RE GOING TO
DIRECT SOME WEREWOLF MOVIE OR
SOMETHING.
>> Jon:  I'VE JOINED THE
MORMON CHURCH.
AND-- IT'S REQUIRED THAT YOU GO
AWAY FOR 10 WEEKS.
>> AND YOU HAVE TO PROSELYTIZE.
>> Jon:  WOULD YOU MISS ME?
>> I WOULD.
I WAS SHOCKED --
>> YOU HAVE GREAT AFFECTION FOR
ME.
I DID NOT GET FIRED.
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
>> Jon:  I'M GOING TO THE
MIDDLE EAST.
>> TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
AND SET UP AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM
WITH-- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO DO GR I'M SETTING UP A
CHARITY.
I'M SURE IT WILL BE FINE.
IT WILL BE ABOVE BOARD.
>> BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
HERE.
WHO WILL BE HERE?
>> Jon:  A YOUNG MAN NAMED
JOHN OLIVER.
A BRITISH GENTLEMAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.
YOU SHOULD-- YOU SHOULD COME IN
AND CHECK UP ON ME.
>> IS HE A MUSLIM, OLIVER?
YOU'RE BRINGING IN A MUSLIM GUY.
>> Jon:  THAT'S RIGHT, I'M
BRING NAIG MUSLIM.
>> IF YOU REALLY WERE SINCERE,
YOU WOULD.
>> Jon:  WHAT?  !
>> IF YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT THE
MUSLIM COMMUNITY, YOU'D BRING IN
A SUBSTITUTE MUSLIM HOST!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LET'S CALL IT FOR WHAT IT IS!
PUT UP OR SHUT UP!
STEWART.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW, IT HURTS
ME TO SAY THIS, BUT SOME OF THE
E-MAILS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE IS FINDING FOR FOX NEWS
IS PROBABLY BETWEEN YOU AND I.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I'D DELETE THEM RIGHT AWAY.
>> Jon:  AND I JUST WANT TO
SAY THAT I DID NOT KNOW THAT
THAT HANUKKAH CARD HAD
PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES ON IT, AND I
APOLOGIZE SINCERELY FOR
BESMIRCHING YOUR SERVER.
NOW WHAT BOOK ARE YOU COMING OUT
WITH NEXT WEEK?
ARE WE ALMOST DONE WITH THIS
ALREADY?
>> THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER BOOK
FOR THREE MONTHS.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THREE MONTHS?
>> THREE MONTHS YOU'LL HAVE TO
WAIT.
AND THEN THE MY NEXT BOOK IS --
>> WHAT IS THE BOOK IN THREE
MONTHS?
>> HOW TO GET MORE MUSLIM
EXCHANGE STUDENTS.
>> Jon:  YOU DON'T CARE.
HE DISTRIBUTE CARE.
"KEEP IT PITHY" IS ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW.
LOOK FOR IT NEXT TO THE 10 OTHER
( BLEEP ) BOOKS HE WRITES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
