(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, MIDTERMELECTIONS RIGHT AROUND THE
CORNER, CONGRESS'S APPROVALRATING IS IN THE TWEENS.
IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN TO RAISE ACRY OF "THROW THE BUMS OUT."
AND THEN RE-ELECT 90% OF SAIDBUMS.
HOW DO THESE GUYS KEEP GETTINGRE-ELECTED TERM AFTER TERM?
WELL, LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OFNEW YORK CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE
RANGEL, 83 YEARS OLD AND 43YEARS IN OFFICE, CENSURED
BY CONGRESS IN 2010 AFTER APHOTO OF HIM ASLEEP IN FRONT
OF HIS DOMINICAN VILLA ON WHICHHE FAILED TO PAY TAXES BECAME
THE SYMBOL OF HIS EXTENSIVEFINANCIAL MALFEASANCE.
HERE'S HOW CONFIDENT HE WAS INBEING RELECTED ANYWAY.
HE USED THAT PHOTO AS HISCAMPAIGN POSTER.
THAT'S WHAT HE DID. HE DOESN'TCARE. THIS YEAR CHARLIE RANGEL
IS LOCKED IN A TIGHT PRIMARYCAMPAIGN AGAINST STATE SENATOR
ADRIANO ESPAILLAT ANDREVEREND MICHAEL WALROND WHO ARE
DETERMINED TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWNIN A MAJOR DEBATE LAST NIGHT.
WHAT COULD RANGEL DO TOCOME OUT A WINNER?
CHECK YOUR POCKETS MACGYVER,
BECAUSE THE CLOCK ISTICKING AND HE'S GOT TO COME
UP WITH SOMETHING.
>> I UNDERSTAND I ONLY HAVETHREE MINUTES AND, JUST ONE
MINUTE(ANSWERS BLACKBERY)
NO I'M THE IN THE MIDDLE OF ADEBATE.
YES, NO IT'S FOR UNITEDSTATES CONGRESS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, THAT WAS QUITE THEMYSTERY RING ON HIS PHONE.
EITHER HE HAD TO TAKE A VERYIMPORTANT CALL FROM HIS
UROLOGIST DURING THE DEBATEOR HE'S ABOUT TO LAUNCH INTO A
BIT.
YES, IN THE GREATEST DEBATETACTIC SINCE LINCOLN ASKED
DOUGLAS, "WHOREMONGER SAYSWHAT?"
CHARLIE RANGEL DID HIS ENTIREOPENING STATEMENT IN THE FORM OF
A GAG  PHONE CALL WITH SOMEONEWHO JUST HAPPENED TO WANT TO
KNOW REALLY TERRIBLE THINGSABOUT THE TWO OTHER
CANDIDATES SITTING NEXT TO HIM.
>> NO, NO, NO, HE'S BEEN HERE 18YEARS BUT HE DIDN'T SAY HE
PASSED ANY BILLS AT ALL.
WELL THE GUY WAS ONLY THERE HALFOF THE TIME.
(RANGEL ON PHONE)LISTEN, HOW CAN HE REGISTER TO
VOTE IN NEW YORK WHENHE LIVES IN JERSEY?
>> Jon: NO, I'M AS CONFUSEDABOUT IT AS YOU ARE, PERSON I
MADE UP!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THIS IS HOW CHARLIERANGEL STAYS IN OFFICE SO LONG.
YES, HE'S CORRUPT BUT HE'S VERYLIKABLE.
I MEAN, HE FIGUREDOUT HOW TO BE A TOTAL
DICK TO THE GUYS SITTING RIGHT
NEXT TO HIM, WITHOUT HAVING TOHAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAID
DICKISHNESS.
>> THEY LOVE HIM AT THE, HE'SVERY ACTIVE AT THE NATIONAL
ACTION NETWORK AND THEY LIKEHIM.
THEY HAVEN'T ENDORSED HIM, OFCOURSE NOT.
>> WHY DIDN'T THEY ENDORSEHIM? I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE
KILLED SOMEONE. THAT I KNOW OF.I MEAN, EVEN IF HE HAD
I'M SURE HE WOULD DISPOSE THEBODY IN A TRADITIONAL --
CANNIBALISM? NO. I DON'T THINKSO. WHAT -- I DON'T KNOW.
NO WONDER HE'S STILL INCONGRESS.
IN FACT, THERE MAY BE NO WAY ATALL TO GET THESE
AGING INCUMBENTS OUT OF OFFICE.
>> CONGRESSMAN JOHN CONYERSEXPECTED TO RUN FOR HIS 26TH
TERM IN NOVEMBER IS BEING KEPTOFF THE BALLOT IN THE PRIMARY
BECAUSE OF INVALID SIGNATURES ONA PETITION.
>> Jon: WOW, SO WITHOUT TERMLIMITS, WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL CONGRESS PEOPLE GET SO OLDTHEYLOSE SIGNATURES LIKE KEYS.
HOW DOES THE CONSTITUTION EVENALLOW FOR THIS TYPE OF
ENTRENCHED INCUMBENCY?
RING, RING.
HELLO?
WHAT'S THAT?
FOUNDING FATHER JAMES MADISON!
WHAT?
YOU NEVER INTENDED FOR ANYONE TOSERVE THAT LONG IN CONGRESS?
WELL, OH, WHEN YOU WERE DRAFTINGTHE CONSTITUTION, LIFE EXPECTY
WAS 48.
I SEE.
AND HOW ARE YOU CALLING ME FROMBEYOND THE -- REALLY?
HEAVEN IS FOR REAL!
AND IT'S ALL JUST (BLEEP).
ALRIGHT. WELL,
YEAH.
NO, HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT.

WELL, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S NICE.
