(LAUGHTER)
I HOPE THEY HAVE-- BUT FIRST
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY
THAT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA
BEGAN HIS SECOND TERM AS
PRESIDENT WITH HIGH HOPES.
BUT NOW JUST FOUR MONTHS
LATER HE FINDS HIMSELF MIRED
IN AN INDEX CASEABLE
DOWNWARD FALL WHERE THE ONLY
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION CAN
COUNT ON IS PUNITIVE IN
NATURE.
HE HAS ENTERED INTO A THREE
AND A HALF YEAR RACE OF
[BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)
HIS ONLY HOPE, THE MEDIA.
(LAUGHTER)
WITH THE ATTENTION SPAN OF A
CONCUSSED GOLDFISH.
MORE OF A PROBLEM THAN WOULD
YOU THINK FOR GOLDFISH.
IT'S NOT THE BOWL AS MUCH AS
SOMETIMES THE THRESHURE
CHEST THEY CAN RUN INTO.
>> THE RACE FOR 2016 ALREADY
HEATING UP.
>> THE RACE FOR 2016.
>> 12016.
>> 2016.
>> 2016.
>> FAST APPROACHING.
>> THERE'S STILL ALMOST A
THOUSAND DAYS BEFORE THE
FIRST VOTE IN THE 2016
CONTEST.
>> Jon: SQUIRREL!
SQUIRREL!
YES, A THOUSAND DAYS UNTIL
THE FIRST PRIMARY VOTES AND
WHILE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN,
THEY'RE PRETTY SURE THEY
KNOW WHAT WILL.

PRESIDENT IN 2016.
>> LOTS OF BUZZ ABOUT TED
CRUZ RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
>> HILLARY CURRENT TON IS
THE ODDS ON FAVORITE TO
BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE.
>> Jon: WOW.
SO 1,000 DAYS BEFORE THE
FIRST PRIMARY WITH ZERO
STATES REPORTING OR CARING.
I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
CALLING THE DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
SHE'S THE WINNER, HILLARY
RODHAM CLINTON.
IT IS CLINTON'S SECOND
VICTORY.
IT'S HER SECOND VICTORY IN
THE RIDICULOUSLY PREMATURE
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
>> HILL ROE CLINTON WILL BE
THE NOMINEE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
SHE WILL CRUSH BARACK OBAMA.
SHE-- BARACK JUST SIT IT
OUT.
IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY, I
PROMISE YOU, YOU HEARD IT
HERE FIRST.
>> Jon: AND THE REST WAS
ALTERNATE HISTORY.
I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING
ABOUT THIS OBAMA PRESIDENCY,
HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT, IT HAS
FOREVER CHANGED THE
EXPECTATION OF WHAT AN
AMERICAN PRESIDENT CAN LOOK
LIKE.
>> FOR MY GENERATION BUT FOR
MY KIDS, BY THE TIME THEY
ARE ABLE TO VOTE THE IDEA OF
A BLACK PRESIDENT WILL BE
ALMOST PASSE T WILL BE
SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY
OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN HAPPEN, A
LATINO PRESIDENT, A WOMAN.
>> THERE WILL BE A FIRST
LATINO PRESIDENT OR LATINA
PRESIDENT.
THERE WILL BE A FIRST GAY
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: WELL, OPENLY GAY.
(LAUGHTER)
GAY.
I THINK WE JUST CHOSE LIKE
FIVE RANDOM PRESIDENTS.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, IT'S A NUMBERS
GAME, REALLY.
NOW FOR FANS OF THE
TRADITIONAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENCY DON'T WORRY.
THERE IS STILL ONE OR TWO
OLD WHITE FELLAS ON THE
MENU.
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN
MAYBE CONSIDERING A
PRESIDENTIAL BID OF HIS OWN.
>> DON'T MISS THE INTERVIEWS
UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE IN KROTS
LIKE THIS ONE.
QUOTE, I JUST HAD LUNCH WITH
THE PRESIDENT.
I SPENT AN AVERAGE OF 4 TO 5
HOURS A DAY WITH HIM, EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
WHEN I SPEAK NO ONE DOUBTS
THAT I SPEAK FOR THE
PRESIDENT.
LIGHT RALLY EVERY MEETING HE
HAS I'M IN.
(LAUGHTER)
DID JUST READ LITERALLY AS
WHITE RALLY?
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SAY
ON LIVE TV LIKE IF YOU DID
THAT'S AWESOME.
I'M SORRY SAW-SO-ME.
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE THAT KIND
