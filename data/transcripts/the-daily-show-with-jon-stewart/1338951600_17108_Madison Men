( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE GARY JOHNSON.
VYING TO BE THE THIRD AMERICAN PRESIDENT NAMED JOHNSON AND THE FIRST NAMED GARY.
(LAUGHTER) LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL IN
AMERICA'S DAIRYLAND, WISCONSIN.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S...
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU PEOPLE BUT HERE WE GO.
LET'S HEAR WHAT'S AT STEAK.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> IT'S A CRUCIAL DAY FOR VOTERS IN WISCONSIN.
>> A RECALL ELECTION IS BEING HELD.
>> SCOTT WALKER IS A VILLAIN TO SOME AND A HERO TO OTHERS.
>> THE REPUBLICAN WILL EITHER STAY IN CHARGE OF THE STATE OR SUFFER ONE OF THE WORST
INDIGNITIES FOR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL: LOSING IN A RECALL ELECTION.
>> WHAT?
THAT'S NOT THE WORST INDIGNITY.
THE I WORST INDIGGITY WOULD BE GIVING A SPEECH AND REALIZING YOU'RE NAKED FROM THE WAIST DOWN.
RIGHT, MR. LINCOLN?
YEAH!
(AUDIENCE REACTS) I NEVER NOTICED THIS BEFORE.
CAN YOU MAKE THAT PENIS BIGGER AND BRING IT CLOSER TO MY FACE,
PLEASE?
(LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, IS THERE ANY NEWS ORGANIZATION WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE HERE?
>> WE LIVED IN CHINA, A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME
FREEDOMS AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AND HOW DO YOU RELATE IT TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN WISCONSIN?
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT'S AN ENTIRELY REASONABLE WAY OF FRAMING THIS DISCUSSION
WITH A PRO-WALKER WISCONSIN SCHOOLTEACHER.
>> GOVERNOR WALKER'S NOT REELECTED AND THE UNIONS CONTINUE TO THRIVE I SEE A LOT
OF FREEDOMS AND CHOICES FOR TEACHERS FOR WISCONSIN FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE TO
BE TAKEN AWAY.
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET AS EXTREME AS COMMUNISM BUT THOSE CHOICES WILL SLOWLY GO AWAY.
>> Jon: IT WILL BE LIKE COMMUNIST CHINA.
(LAUGHTER) IF WALKER LOSES WE'LL ALL BE FORCED TO JOIN UNIONS-- LIKE IN CHINA.
(LAUGHTER) SO GRETCHEN CARLSON BRAVELY STANDING UP TO WISCONSIN'S
MONTEREY JACKBOOTED UNION THUGS.
BUT LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THERE WAS A TRAITOR IN THE FOX MIDST.
A CERTAIN PROPAGANDA MASTER/POLLSTER NAMED FRANK LUNTZ WHOSE CAREFULLY SELECTED
FOCUS GROUP OF WISCONSIN VOTERS STRATEGICALLY FRAMED BY PRESIDENTIAL PORTRAITS FEATURED
AN INCREDIBLY SUBVERSIVE MESSAGE DELIVERED UNWITTINGLY BY THIS WOMAN RIGHT THERE.
SEE IT?
CAN I GET A CLOSEUP OF THAT PLEASE?
NOTICE ANYTHING?
(LAUGHTER) HOW THAT WOMAN'S HAIR TRANSFORMS OUR GREATEST CONSERVATIVE HERO
RONALD REAGAN'S PORTRAIT TURNING IT INTO, I DON'T KNOW, STALIN?
(LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.
STUMBLING UPON THIS MADE FOR A VERY ENJOYABLE MORNING WRITER'S MEETING, I MIGHT ADD.
(LAUGHTER) IF SHE HAD GRAY HAIR REAGAN
