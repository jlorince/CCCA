OF -- YOU KNOW, WE SPEND AN
AWFUL LOT OF TIME HERE TALKING
ABOUT SOUTH CAROLINA.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY GIVE SO MUCH.
BUT IT'S EASY TO FORGET ABOUT
THE OTHER MARGINALLY SANER
CAROLINA, WESTERN -- NORTH,
NORTH CAROLINA.
WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN THERE THIS
ELECTION SEASON?
>> PUBLIC POLICY POLLING SAID
ANDY GRIFFITH'S POLL NUMBERS IN
NORTH CAROLINA HAVE DROPPED BY
25 POINTS IN TWO YEARS.
>> Jon: TWO THINGS:  ONE, ANDY
GRIFFITH IS STILL ALIVE?
YES!
I LOVE THAT GUY.
AND TWO, HOW DO YOU TURN AGAINST
OPIE'S PA.
MATLOCK A PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF
FREEDOM, WINNER --
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT HAPPENED, NORTH CAROLINA D
GRIFFITH WIPE HIS ASS ON ONE OF
DEAN SMITH'S JACKETS?
>> GRIFFITH WAS FEATURED IN A
JULY AD FOR THE GOVERNMENT
PROMISE GOING THINGS FROM THE
HEALTH CARE LAW.
>> Jon: HE HAS THAT OBAMA
STINK ON HIM NOW.
THIS AD MUST BE VERY DIVISIVE.
>> WITH THE NEW HEALTH CARE LAW
MORE GOOD THINGS ARE COMING.
FREE CHECKUPS, LOWER
PRESCRIPTION COSTS AND BETTER
WAYS TO PROTECT US THAN
MEDICARE.
SEE WHAT ELSE IS NEW.
I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE
IT.
>> Jon: MUST KILL ANDY
GRIFFITH --
[LAUGHTER]
WOW, THAT'S A POWERFUL AD.
THAT IS WHAT GOT PEOPLE IN NORTH
CAROLINA SO UPSET?
YET WILFORD BRIMLEY HAS BEEN
THREATING TO GIVE US ALL
DIABETES FOR YEARS.
HIS (bleep) STILL SMELLS LIKE
ROSES.
FOR ANDY GRIFF GRIFFITH SUPERFAN
BILL O'REILLY THE SADDEST THING
IS THAT ONE SPECIFIC NORTH
CAROLINIAN MIGHT HAVE TURNED HER
BACK AGAINST ANDY.
>> NUMBER ONE, SELMA HAS TURNED
AGAINST ANDY.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT?
>> I KNEW IT.
THAT WAS ANDY'S SQUEEZE.
>> I REMEMBER BARNEY FIFE.
>> HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND?
>> I HOPE SO.
I HOPE HE WASN'T JUST HIM AND
BARNEY AND FLOYD.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT, A GAY
WEDDING?
I DON'T KNOW, ANDY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OH, REALLY, BILL.
WAS SHE ANDY'S GIRLFRIEND.
>> IT WAS ONE OF THEM NUTTY
THINGS.
IT WAS ONE OF THEM NUTTY
SITUATIONS I GET MYSELF INTO AND
YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL I LOVE.
>> Jon: THAT WAS BARNEY'S
GIRLFRIEND.
ANDY WENT OUT WITH HELEN
STARTING IN SEASON THREE.
BUSTED O'REILLY.
WHO IS THE PEA HEAD NOW.
CHECK YOUR FACTS, OLD MAN.
WE'RE HOLDING YOUR FEET TO THE
FIRE!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
I EXPECT A FULL RESTRAKS ON
AIR -- RETRACTION ON AIR
OTHERWISE I MIGHT NEVER TRUST
FOX AGAIN.
BUT YOUR LARGER POINT IS SOUND,
ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A
GIRLFRIEND IS GAY.
AND THAT IS GROSS AND WRONG.
RIGHT, BARNEY?
>> YOU'VE HAD IDEAS IN YOUR TIME
BUT THIS ONE IS THE WORST!
>> Jon: WELL, THE WORST
