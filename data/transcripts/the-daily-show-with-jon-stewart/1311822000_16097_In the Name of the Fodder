COMEDY CENTRAL
[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM
FOR YOU TONIGHT THAT I THINK
WILL DELIGHT AND ENTERTAIN.
MY GUEST RACHEL WEISZ HERE TO
TALK ABOUT HER NEW FILM.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HER NEW FILM IS CALLED "THE
WHISTLEBLOWER."
IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL WHO
FINDS A WHISTLE.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE
REST.
[LAUGHTER]
SHE BLOWS THE WHISTLE.
SHE ULTIMATELY BLOWS THE
WHISTLE.
BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN
NORWAY.
OBVIOUSLY WHAT NORWAY'S GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW IS JUST AWFUL.
PEOPLE ARE UPSET, ANGRY,
OUTRAGED, ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE'S
UPSET, ANGER AND OUTRAGE, AT
LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY, EXTENDS
INTO AREAS THAT MAY SURPRISE
YOU.
>> WHY IS THE LIBERAL PRESS
PLAYING UP THE CHRISTIAN ANGLE
IN THE NORWAY SHOOTING CASE?
>> THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WAS
QUICK TO PORTRAY THE SUSPECT AS
A CHRISTIAN EXTREMIST.
>> THEY LAY DOWN THIS NARRATIVE
EVERY TIME THERE'S A PSYCHOOUT
THERE.
HE'S A FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIAN
THAT.
IS NOT THE CASE ABSOLUTELY AT
ALL.
>> THEY QUICKLY LABELED HIM
CHRISTIAN WHEN THERE'S NOTHING
RELIGIOUS ACTED HIS APPROACH.
>> THE IDEA IN ANY WAY HE
REPRESENTS ANY MAINSTREAM OR
EVEN FRINGE SENTIMENT IN THE
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS
RIDICULOUS.
>> Jon: YES.
[LAUGHTER]
THE MASSACRE IN NORWAY IS A
TRAGIC STORY ABOUT THE
PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK, I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A
LIMB HERE.
LAURA INGRAM, MMM, IS RIGHT.
THE IDEA THAT THIS KILLER
REPRESENTS MAINSTREAM SENTIMENT
IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS
RIDICULOUS.
THAT BEING SAID, PEOPLE DRAWING
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A
PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNING OF
HIS MADNESS TO A CHRISTIAN
CRUSADER MENTALITY ARE NOT DOING
IT TO GET AT YOU.
THE CONNECTION STEMS MOSTLY FROM
TWO THINGS: THE SHOOTER'S
1,500-PAGE, CRUCIFIX DRENCHED
CALL TO RECLAIM WESTERN
CHRISTIAN COME FROM THE
INFIDELS, AND TWO, THE
SHOOTERS'S KNIGHTS TEMPLAR 2083
POWER POINT PAYING TRIBUTE TO
CHARLES THE EMPEROR TO VLAD THE
IMPALER.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HAVE MORE
SYMPATHY FOR THE...
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HAVE MORE
SYMPATHY FOR THE FOX RAPID
RESPONSE TEAM'S NUANCED CONCERNS
IF THEIR PLEA TO DISTINGUISH
VIOLENCE PROCLAIM IN THE NAME OF
A RELIGION FROM THE
PRACTITIONERS AND TENETS OF SAID
RELIGION WERE APPLIED TO, UH,
LET'S SAY MORE THAN JUST ONE
LIDGE -- RELIGION.
BILL O'REILLY IS VERY CLEAR AS
TO WHY THIS NORWAY KILLER IS
CHRISTIAN.
>> BREIVIK IS NOT A CHRISTIAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE BELIEVING IN JESUS
COMMITS MASS MURDER.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THIS MAN
WAS A MEMBER OF A CHURCH.
NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.
WE CAN FIND NO EVIDENCE, NONE,
THAT THIS KILLER PRACTICED
CHRISTIANITY IN ANY WAY.
THEY CALL HIM A CHRISTIAN
BECAUSE HE SAYS HE IS?
COME ON.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: COME ON!
AND LET ME SAY THIS IN DEFENSE
OF MR. O'REILLY, ISN'T IT ENOUGH
FOR ONE MAN TO HAVE THE BURDEN
OF DETERMINING WHO AMONGST US IS
EITHER A PINHEAD OR A PATRIOT?
BUT TO ASK HIM TO ALSO SEPARATE
CHRISTIAN FROM HEATHEN, IT'S TOO
MUCH OF A BURDEN.
[LAUGHTER]
HE'S BUT ONE VERY TALL MAN, OR
AS I'M CONVINCED, A SHORT MAN ON
ANOTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS WEARING
AN OVERSIZED SUIT.
MY POINT IS THIS: CLEARLY...
[APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
CLEARLY O'REILLY DID NOT BELIEVE
THIS KILLER'S ACTIONS OR PROFILE
QUALIFY HIM AS CHRISTIAN, WHICH
I WOULD AGREE WITH, BUT HIS
BARRIER TO ENTRY IS SOMEWHAT
LESS STRICT WHEN IT COMES TO
LINKING THE FORT HOOD MANIAC AND
ISLAM.
>> I'M SAYING THAT HE WAS A
MUSLIM TERRORIST BECAUSE HE
CARRIED A BUSINESS CARD THAT
SAID "SOLDIER OF ALLAH."
AND HE COMMITTED HIS CRIMES IN
THE NAME OF ALLAH.
>> Jon: SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT GUY PRINTED UP SOLDIER OF
ALLAH BUSINESS CARDS.
THE OTHER GUY ONLY PRINTED UP AN
ARMY OF CHRIST MANIFESTO.
I GUESS THE ONLY CONNECTION IS
BOTH PSYCHOS FOR SOME REASON
SPENT THE DAY AT
