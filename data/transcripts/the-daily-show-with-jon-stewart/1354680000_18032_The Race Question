WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, NEW YORK METS PITCHER AND RECENT CY YOUNG RECIPIENT-- CY YOUNG RECIPIENT--
R.A. DICKEY IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE MAN.
MAY BE THE FIRST GUEST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PROGRAM TO BE TRADED WHILE I AM TALKING TO HIM.
(LAUGHTER) THEY MAY JUST -- THEY MAY COME IN AND TAKE HIM AWAY.
(LAUGHTER) I THINK I'LL ASK HIM WHAT RACE HE'D LIKE TO BE.
(LAUGHTER) SOMEBODY ASKED ME THAT BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED.
(LAUGHTER) WE WERE TALKING BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED AND EVERYBODY'S GOT A QUESTION AND "WHO WOULD WIN IN A
FIGHT, FROG OR SHARK?" THAT KIND OF THING.
SOMEONE JUST SAID TO ME "WHAT RACE WOULD YOU BE IF YOU COULD BE -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY A JEW IS
FINE BUT, I MEAN -- IF YOU HAD A CHANCE, I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU GO ASIAN JUST FOR A DAY?"
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S FINE.
THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE!
