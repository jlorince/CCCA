(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN, DO WE HAVE A SHOW FORYOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OUR OLDPAL JAKE GYLLENHAAL IS
JOIN US IN A LITTLE BITMENTAN WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT
THAT.
>> Jon: BUT I DID WANT TO-- RECENTLY, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE SHOWRECENTLY.
WE'VE ONLY BEEN NOW A COUPLE OFDAYS, WE HAD A LITTLE BREAK.
BUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOTABOUT A CERTAIN REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHOSE CAMPAIGN HAS CAPTUREDAMERICA'S INABILITY TO TURN
AWAY FROM SPECTACULARMAN-MADE DISASTERS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AT WHAT PRICE, AS OUR GOODFRIEND MAXIMUS ONCE SAID, ARE
YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!
OF COURSE WE ARE.
BUT MUCH LIKE INCESSANTMASTURBATION, EVENTUALLY YOU
FEEL A DEEP SENSE OF SHAME.
(LAUGHTER)
NOT ENOUGH TO STOP YOU FROMDOING IT ENTIRELY, BUT ENOUGH TO
SLOW YOU DOWN A BIT AND, IF THATGIVES THE ONLINE PORN SITES A
CHANCE TO UPDATE THEIR VIDEOSTOCK, ALL THE BETTER.
MY POINT IS THIS: OURINCESSANT TRUMP-GAZING HAS
CAUSED US TO MISS IMPORTANTNON-TRUMP NEWS.
>> HISTORIC DEAL, THENUCLEAR AGREEMENT THAT COULD
CHANGE THE WORLD.
>> THE ACCORD AGREED TO BYIRAN AND SIX WORLD POWERS IS
INTENDED ON KEEPING IRANFROM PRODUCING A NUCLEAR
WEAPON FOR AT LEAST ADECADE.
>> AFTER 20 MONTHS OFNEGOTIATIONS, AFTER YEARS OF
OF SANCTIONS, THE PRESIDENT SAIDTODAY THAT DIPLOMACY HAD
TRIUMPHED.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'SSUCH GREAT NEWS!
UNLESS -- IS DIPLOMACY THE NAMEOF OUR NEW DRONE BY ANY
CHANCE?
IS THAT-- OF COURSE NOT.
WELCOME BACK, IRAN.
A HUGE MILESTONE, COULD BRINGYOU BACK INTO THE GLOBAL
COMMUNITY WHILE ALSO HELPINGTO EASE FEARS THAT YOU WILL
BLOW UP SAID GLOBALCOMMUNITY.
(LAUGHTER)
IRAN HAS PROMISED TO FREEZETHEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM, DISABLE
THEIR PLUTONIUM REACTOR, CUTTHEIR CENTRIFUGES.
IT IS A LANDMARK DIPLOMATICACCOMPLISHMENT.
OR, TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY --
>> THIS IS A BAD DEAL.
>> AWFUL DEAL.
>> TERRIBLE DEAL.
>> WHAT A STUNNING HISTORICMISTAKE.
>> HISTORICALLY BAD DEAL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HISTORICALLY BAD DEAL.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ASA METS FAN.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUTHISTORICALLY BAD DEALS.
AS A FAN OF A BASEBALL TEAMTHAT ONCE TRADED FUTURE HALL
OF FAME PITCHER NOLAN RYANAWAY FOR FUTURE NOT SO HALL
OF FAMER JIM FREGOSI, I KNOWA BAD DEAL WHEN I SEE ONE.
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THISDEAL?
>> YOU HAVE NOW INSUREDTHERE THEY WILL BECOME A
NUCLEAR NATION. THIS IS A BADDEAL, THE WORST POSSIBLE
OUTCOME, AS YOU CREATED ANUCLEAR ARMS RACE IN THE
MIDEAST, YOU PUT ISRAEL ATRISK AND US AT RISK.
>> Jon: OKAY THAT'S A [BLEEP]UP DEAL.
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE A BADDEAL.
WOW, I'M SORRY, SENATORGRAHAM, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
SHOCKED WHEN YOU SAW THOSEDETAILS IN THE COPY OF THE
DEAL THAT YOU READ.
>> THE ONLY OTHER THING THATI WOULD ADD IS THAT WE DON'T
KNOW ALL THE SPECIFICS TOTHIS PLAN.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> BUT YOU YOURSELF HAVEN'TREAD ANYTHING.
>> THAT'S TRUE, BUT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I HAVE NOT-- I HAVENOT READ IT, I HAVE NOT READ
THIS DEAL, BUT AS GOD IS MYWITNESS, I FEEL THIS DEAL AS
STRONGLY AS ONE COULD FEELTHAT A LOVED ONE HAS BEEN
FELLED AT THE BATTLE OFVICKSBURG.
AND NOW THE PLANTATIONHAS TO BE RUN BY YOU AND YOU
ALONE.
OH, LINCOLN.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN READ THE DEAL?
BASICALLY YOU'RE TREATINGTHIS CRITICAL INTERNATIONAL
ACCORD LIKE SOME KIND OF BYBIZARRE-O iTUNES USER
AGREEMENT -- BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,SKIP ALL THE DETAILS, GO TO
THE BOTTOM AND CLICK,DISAGREE.
I THOUGHT TAKING WAY THEKEYS TO IRAN'S NUKES WOULD
BE A GOOD THING.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?
>> THIS DEAL PUTS THEM ONTHE PATH TO BE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON STATE IN EIGHT TO 10YEARS.
>> THEY'LL HAVE A BOMBPROBABLY WITHIN 15 YEARS.
>> NUCLEAR WARHEADS WITHIN10 OR 15 YEARS.
>> Jon: 10 OR 15 YEARS?
WITH THE WAY THE WORLD'SGOING?
[BLEEP], A NUCLEAR IRAN ISGOING TO BE THE LEAST OF OUR
PROBLEMS IN 10 OR 15 YEARS.
IRANIAN NUKES WILL BE ABLINK FROM SWIMMING THROUGH
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE-FLOODEDCITIES FIGHTING, EBOLA ZOMBIES
WITH OUR TEETH BECAUSE WE CAN'THOLD GUNS, THANKS TO OUR iPHONE-
SHAPED HAND TUMORS.
THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO BEEXTREME.
(APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY.
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHUSEEMS VERY UP SET IRAN MIGHT
HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN TENYEARS SINCE HIS PRE-DEAL
ESTIMATE WAS SLIGHTLY LESSOPTIMISTIC.
>> BY NEXT SPRING, AT MOST,BY NEXT SUMMER, AT CURRENT
ENRICHMENT RATES, THEY WILLHAVE FINISHED THE MEDIUM
ENRICHMENT AND MOVE ON TOTHE FINAL STAGE.
FROM THERE IT'S ONLY A FEWMONTHS, POSSIBLY A FEW WEEKS
BEFORE THEY GET ENOUGHENRICHED URANIUM FOR THE
FIRST BOMB.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUTIRAN OR WILE E. COYOTE, WHO ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
SO, LISTEN, SIR, BY YOUR OWNMATH, THIS DEAL JUST BOUGHT
US ABOUT NINE YEARS.
I'M SURE THIS DEAL AIN'TPERFECT.
LIFTING SANCTIONS COULDEMPOWER IRAN TO FURTHER FUND
DESTABILIZING TERROR GROUPS INTHE REGION, THERE ARE STILL
FOUR AMERICANS BEING HELD THERE.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HASTO BE DEALT WITH.
BUT WHAT IS OUR ALTERNATIVE.
>> I THINK THE ALTERNATIVEIS FOR CONGRESS TO REJECT
THIS DEAL AND DEMAND ABETTER DEAL.
>> MY ANSWER IS A BETTERDEAL, GO BACK AND MAKE A
BETTER DEAL.
>> Jon: AH, BETTER.
YES.
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT.
A BETTER DEAL WOULD BEBETTER.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT WOULDTHIS BETTER DEAL ENTAIL?
>> WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANACCEPTABLE DEAL, IN YOUR
MIND?
>> DESCRIBING THE PERFECTDEAL, I GUESS WOULD BE A
DEAL UNDER WHICH IRAN WOULDNOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SOME WOULD SAY THAT'STOTAL LOGICAL REASON.
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE A TURTLE FLIPPED ONITS BACK.
(APPLAUSE)
CLEARLY, I THINK THE REPUBLICANSJUST NEED TO GET BEHIND SOMEONE
WHO UNDERSTANDS DEAL MAKING--
UNLEASH THE KRAKEN!
>> YOU LOOK AT THIS IRANDEAL, WHICH IS A TOTAL
DISASTER AND WE DONE EVENGET OUR PRISONERS BACK.
IF YOU HAD THE RIGHTMESSENGER, LIKE IF I DID OR
IF I PICKED SOMEBODY THATDID IT THAT KNEW ABOUT
NEGOTIATION, NOT SOMEBODYTHAT GOES INTO A BICYCLE
RACE AND BLEAKS HIS LEG AT73 YEARS OLD.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T TRUSTKERRY, THAT FRAGILE PRICK.
YOU CAN'T SEND AN OLDHANDICAPPED MAN TO MAKE A DEAL,
LIKE WHEN WE SENT THAT POLIO-RIDDLED LOSER TO YALTA.
[BLEEP] THAT PRICK.
I WOULD HAVE WON US EAST ANDWEST GERMANY.
BE REALISTIC, ONE COUNTRYCANNOT JUST FORCE ANOTHER
COUNTRY TO DO WHAT IT WANTS.
WHEN HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED?
>> GREECE IS NOW A WHOLLYOWNED PROTECTORATE, OWNED BY
GERMANY AND ANGELA MERKEL.
>> GREECE DIDN'T HAVE A LOTOF CHOICE BECAUSE ITS
MASTERS ARE IN GERMANY ANDTHEY HAVE TO ANSWER TO THE
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS.
>> Jon: OF COURSE.
GREECE!
THE WAY TO BRING A COUNTRYTO HEAL IS NOT TO ISOLATE
THEM ECONOMICALLY, BUT TOMAKE THEM DEPENDENT ON YOU
ECONOMICALLY THROUGH ASERIES OF CRIPPLING,
UNPAYABLE, PREDATORY LOANS.
AND I BELIEVE IN THATAREA I CAN SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY:
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
>> GOLDMAN-SACHS ENGAGED INA SERIES OF APPARENTLY LEGAL
TRANSACTIONS THAT WEREDESIGNED TO HIDE THE TRUE
LEVEL OF GREEK DEBT.
AND THAT'S HOW THE TROUBLESTARTED.
>> Jon: YEAH, MOTHER [BLEEP].
WE DON'T NEED TO ISOLATEIRAN, WE NEED TO HIT THEM
WITH A LOAN STRIKE.
YEAH, I LIKE THIS.
I LIKE THIS STRATEGY.
GIVE OUR MILITARY A REST ANDDESTROY IRAN PURELY THROUGH
ECONOMIC RELATION.
THINK IT WON'T WORK?
IT ALREADY IS.
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,FOLLOW THE MONEY.
>> McDONALD'S WANTS TO OPENA FRANCHISE IN TEHRAN.
>> Jon: McDONALD'S IN TEHRAN!
TRUST ME, AFTER THE COMPLETEAMERICANIZATION OF IRAN, THE
ONLY THING THEY WILL BE SIXMONTHS AWAY FROM DEVELOPING
IS DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
