>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS LINDA
POLMAN, THE AUTHOR OF "CRISIS
CARAVAN", IT'S BEEN A CARAVAN
THAT IS NOT DOING WELL.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR CHARITY
DOLLARS AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH BLOW THE RED CROSS IS
DOING.
[LAUGHTER]
WITH FIVE WEEKS TO GO UNTIL THE
ELECTION THERE'S A TALK ABOUT AN
ENTHUSIASM GAP BETWEEN THE
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
BASICALLY SAL RATE ISING
REPUBLICANS ARE CAMPING OUT IN
FRONT OF THE POLLS LIKE THEY ARE
WAITING FOR THE NEXT HARRY
POTTER BOOK.
[LAUGHTER]
WHILE DEMOCRATS REMAIN AT HOME
WATCHING TAPES OF OBAMA'S 2004
RED AND BLUE AMERICA SPEECH
WAOEPG AND -- WEEPING AND
PICKING FUNYAN DUST OUT OF THEIR
BELLY BUTTON.
THE DEMS ARE GOING TO STEP INTO
CAMPAIGN MODE AND MOTIVATE THE
TROOPS.
>> VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TOLD A
FUND RAISER THAT THEY NEED
REMIND THE BASE TO STOP WHINING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE VICE PRESIDENT JOE
BIDEN UNVEILING THE NEW SLOGAN
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, WALK IT
OFF YOU PUSSIES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S BIDEN FROM THE GUT
ADDRESSING DEMOCRATIC -- YOU
LIKE THAT?
IS IT THE FONT OR THE PICTURE?
[LAUGHTER]
BIDEN FROM THE GUT IS ADDRESSING
DEMOCRATIC VOTER COMPLAINTS THAT
RATHER THAN BEING
TRANSFORMATIVE, THIS
ADMINISTRATION HAS LAYERED A
MIXED BAG OF REFORMS OVER A CORE
RODED FOUNDATION OF BUSINESS AS
USUAL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK A MORE
CEREBRAL APPROACH OF VOTER APATH
Y.
>> IT'S INEXCUSABLE FOR A
DEMOCRAT OR PROGRESSIVE RIGHT
NOW TO STAND ON THE SIDELINES IN
THIS MID TERM ELECTION.
PEOPLE ARE SITTING ON THEIR
HANDS COMPLAINING IS JUST
IRRESPONSIBLE.
>> Jon: OBAMA'S MESSAGE:  YOU
ARE DISAPPOINTED IN ME?
WELL, I'M DOUBLY DISAPPOINTED IN
YOU QUITE FRANKLY.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, YOU KNOW THE MOST
DISAPPOINTING THING ABOUT YOU?
YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT IN ME.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT CAN
STILL CONNECT, CAN STILL BRING
THE MAGIC ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
AS HE PROVED YESTERDAY AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON
GETTING THE KIND OF RECEPTION
NORMALLY RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO
WOULD LIKE TO, AND I'M QUOTING
HERE, BEAT MINNESOTA.
>> I HAD SOME FUN TIMES UP NEAR
MADISON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I CAN'T GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I HAVE GOOD MEMORIES HERE.
>> Jon: KIND OF FUZZY, IT'S
KIND OF FUZZY BUT I REMEMBER
THIS ONE NIGHT, ME AND MY BOY
BILLY A *EURZ WERE PLAYING BEER
PONG WITH THE TRI DEALTS AND HE
GOES WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF ONE
OF US OR BOTH OF US SUBVERTED
THE CONSTITUTION FROM INSIDE THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.
CONDOOR 4 CUT HIS MIC, CONDOR
FOUR -- I DON'T SCREEN A WATCH.
ONCE THE PRESIDENT PROVED HE
WASN'T A NARC HE TOOK THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HIS CRITICS
HE WAS JUST GETTING WARMED UP.
>> I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE TWO YEARS
GUYS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHECKLIST
WE'VE ALREADY COVERED ABOUT 70%
SO I FIGURED I NEED TO HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF YEARS.
>> Jon: 70%?
LET'S CHECK THE LIST.
OKAY.
YEAH, MADE A CHECKLIST HE WORKED
OUT.
DID MEET STEVIE WONDER.
WON A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
GOT AN iPAD AND SELECTED --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
SO HE'S RIGHT.
HE ONLY HAS THREE MORE ON THE
LIST.
[LAUGHTER]
PROBABLY KNOCK OUT THAT OTHER
30% BY JANUARY.
COME ON, OBAMA.
THESE ARE COLLEGE KIDS.
I'LL TALK TO THEM ABOUT MAKING
LISTS OR PERCENTAGES.
GIVE THEM A METAPHOR THEY CAN
DIG THEIR BADGER PAWS INTO.
>> MANY OF THE FOLKS IN THE
OTHER PARTY WHO ARE RUNNING
TODAY ARE THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE
WHO SPENT THE LAST DECADE
DRIVING OUR ECONOMY INTO THE
DITCH.
>> Jon: THERE YOU GO.
WHAT COLLEGE STUDENT CAN'T
RELATE TO IRRESPONSIBLE
VEHICULAR OPERATION?
>> WE ALL WENT DOWN INTO THE
DITCH AND WE PUT ON OUR BOOTS.
IT WAS MUDDY DOWN THERE AND
DIRTY AND DUSTY.
WE WERE SWEATING AND WE WERE
PUSHING THE CAR OUT OF DITCH.
EVERY SO OFTEN WE WOULD LOOK UP
AND SEEING THE REPUBLICANS
STANDING THERE, THEY ARE JUST
STANDING THERE SIPPING ON A
SHRURPY AND WAVING AT US.
>> Jon: WE'RE TRYING TO GET
THE CAR OUT OF DITCH AND THE
REPUBLICANS WERE LIKE, I'VE GOT
BRAIN FREEZE.
AND THEN WE'RE IN THE DITCH,
SAVE THE WORLD.
THEY ARE RUBBING THEIR HEADS
LIKE THIS.
OH, MY HEAD IS -- AHHH!
>> FINALLY BE GET IT UP ON LEVEL
GROUND AND SUDDENLY WE GET A TAP
ON THE SHOULDER.
WE LOOK BEHIND US AND WHO IS IT?
IT'S THE REPUBLICANS AND THEY
ARE ASKING FOR THE KEYS BACK.
AND WE'VE GOT TO TELL THEM, YOU
CAN'T HAVE THE KEYS BACK.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE!
>> Jon: BUT THE REPUBLICANS
DON'T LIST AND THEY GET IN THE
CAR AND THEY START IT.
THEY DRIVE AWAY.
WE'RE LIKE MY GOD INJURE SLURPEE
IS ON THE CAR.
THE POINT IS CASH FOR CLUNKERS.
IT WAS A FINE METAPHOR.
OWE BALM WHY'S MESSAGE IS THAT
THE GRUELING LEGISLATIVE
ACHIEVEMENTS PUSHED WILL YOU THE
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS MAY NOT HAVE
GOTTEN US ALL THE WAY UP THE
HILL OR EVEN ON TO, LET'S SAY A
PAVED ROAD, BUT IT'S GOTTEN US
OUT OF THE DITCH.
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SO MANY
DEMOCRATS RUNNING ADS PROUDLY
TOUTING THEIR PARTY'S
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
>> WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
NANCY PELOSI PRESSURED CHET HE
HAD YARDS -- EDWARDS, CHET STOOD
UP TO THEM.
>> BOBBY VOTED AGAINST THE
TRILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL BUDGET.
WHEN WASHINGTON LIBERALS WANTED
TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS CHET SAID
NO.
>> Jon: OHILY -- HOLY
(bleep), THOSE ARE THE ADS
THAT DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING?
WHAT ADS ARE THE REPUBLICANS
RUNNING?
[LAUGHTER]
>> VOTE FOR ME AND I'LL PUNCH
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE BALLS.
>> JIMMY DON FOR CONGRESS.
>> IN THE BALLS!
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I BELIEVE THAT
GENTLEMAN WOULD TRY THAT.
ROUGH TIMES FOR DEMOCRATS BUT
I'LL TELL YOU ONE OCTOBER
SURPRISE THAT IS A NO BRAINER
FOR THEM.
EXTEND THE TAX CUTS FOR THE
BOTTOM 98% OF INCOME EARNERS
BEFORE THE ELECTION STENY HOYER
SEIZING THE MOMENT.
>> WILL THEY VOTE THIS WEEK ON
WHETHER OR NOT TO EXTEND THE
BUSH TAX CUT?
>> I DOUBT THAT WE WILL, LET ME
TELL YOU WHY.
>> Jon: BECAUSE WE SUCK.
