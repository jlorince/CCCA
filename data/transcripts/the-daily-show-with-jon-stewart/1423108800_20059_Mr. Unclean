( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WELCOME BACK.
NOW, AS WE'VE SEEN OUR CURRENTCONGRESS, THE 114th,
IS A WASTE-FILLED PIG LAGOON OFANIMOSITY AND CYNICISM.
LUCKILY, THERE'S SOME NEW BLOODIN TOWN WITH CONVICTIONS AS YET
UNSPOILED BY WASHINGTON.
TAKE FRESHMAN SENATOR THOMTILLIS WHOSE MESSAGE TO
NORTH CAROLINA VOTERS HASALWAYS BEEN CLEAR.
>> TILLIS IS A FREE-MARKETCONSERVATIVE.
>> A CONSERVATIVE BUSINESSMANWHO CUT RED TAPE TO CREATE
GOOD-PAYING JOBS.
>> WE NEED TO REDUCEREGULATIONS.
THE OVER-REACH IS DESTROYING OUROPPORTUNITIES.
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET OUT OFTHE WAY.
>> Jon: IT'S GETTING TO THEPOINT WHERE A MAN CAN'T EVEN
OPEN A CAR WASH, A CAFE, OR ABIG LEAF-COVERED PIT WITH
SPIKES AT THE BOTTOM OF ITOR A TATTOO BABY PARLOR.
( LAUGHTER )DAMN YOU, GOVERNMENT!
OF COURSE, A LOT OFPOLITICIANS SPOUT THIS FREE
MARKET IDEOLOGY WHEN IT SERVESTHEIR PURPOSE.
IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO DO INPRACTICE.
>> I WAS HAVING THIS DISCUSSIONWITH-- WITH SOMEONE, AND WE WERE
AT A STARBUCKS IN MY DISTRICT,AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
CERTAIN REGULATIONS.
SHE SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, DON'T YOUBELIEVE THAT THIS REGULATION
THAT REQUIRES THIS GENTLEMAN TOWASH HIS HANDS BEFORE HE SERVES
YOUR FOOD IS IMPORTANT?
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SAID FREE MARKET.
YOU'RE A FREE-MARKET GUY.
YOU WANT GOVERNMENT OUT OF THEWAY.
SENATOR TILLIS, IT'S NOT GOINGTO BE EASY TO FLOP THIS BEDROCK
PRINCIPLE OF MODERN SANITATIONREGULATION BUT AS A FREE
MARKETEER, GO AHEAD.
I DARE YOU.
>> I SAID I DON'T HAVE ANYPROBLEM WITH STARBUCKS IF THEY
CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THISPOLICY.
>> Jon:  BOOM!
THIS GUY WALKS THE WALK! LADIESAND GENTLEMEN, THE TITLE OF
MR. AYN RAND OF2015 GOES TO THOM TILLIS.
I WOULD HIGH-5 HIM BUT I DON'TWANT TO DIE LIKE A CHARACTER IN
THE GAME OREGON TRAIL.
SENATOR!
REALLY?
YOU DON'T WANT THE GUY TO HAVETO WASH HIS HANDS AFTER USING
THE BATHROOM?
MAYBE YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THENEED FOR BASIC HYGIENE STANDARDS
BECAUSE YOU'RE USED TO THERELATIVELY NOT VOMIT-SOAKED
STARBUCKS.
BUT YOU GO ANYWHERE ELSE, YOU'LLSEE THAT OUR FOOD SERVICE
INDUSTRY IS BARELY HANGINGON BY A THREAD.
>> I WATCHED YOU PICK UP RAWCHICKEN ALL NIGHT IN YOUR HANDS
AND THEN TOUCH COOKED FOODS.
>> I'M POURING COCKROACHES OUTOF GLASSES.
YOU DON'T SERVE BUGS TO YOURCUSTOMERS.
>> GET A RAG AND PICK THIS( BLEEP ) THING UP!
LOOK AT THIS.>> OH MY GOD.
>> A HORSE TOOK A CRAP IN THEMIDDLE OF THIS BAR TONIGHT, AND
THEY DIDN'T EVEN CLEAN IT UP.
SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN! ( BLEEP )!
>> Jon:  THAT'S WHAT YOURLOCAL BAR LOOKS LIKE WHEN THEY
TRY TO FOLLOW THE RULES.
BUT ALRIGHT, IF TILLIS THINKSMAKING EMPLOYEES WASH HANDS IS
TOO ONEROUS BY THEGOVERNMENT, I-- I CAN'T
FAULT HIM FOR STICKING TO HISUNREGULATED GUNS.
>> AS LONG AS THEY POST A SIGNTHAT SAYS WE DON'T REQUIRE OUR
EMPLOYEES TO WASH THEIR HANDSAFTER LEAVING THE RESTROOM, THE
MARKET WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  YOU DO REALIZE THAT
THAT'S A REGULATION, TOO, RIGHT?
( LAUGHTER )ALL YOU DID WAS CHANGE THIS TO
THIS.
( LAUGHTER )THAT'S NOT GETTING RID OF
REGULATION.
THAT JUST MAKES YOU ANINCONSISTENT IDEOLOGUE WITH A
LIGHT FECAL DUSTING IN YOURLATTE.
SEE, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IN YOUR TRULY FREE MARKETUTOPIAN WORLD, THE RESTAURANT
WOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL YOU IFEMPLOYEES' HANDS ARE WASHED OR
NOT.
AND BY THE TIME THE MARKETFIGURED OUT JUST WHICH
ESTABLISHMENTS' VENTE PUMPKINSPICE CAME WITH THE
TURD-I-CCINO-- THAT'SCOPYRIGHTED -- IT REALLY
WOULDN'T MATTER BECAUSE WE WOULDBE FAR MORE CONCERNED WITH THE
FREE-MARKET PRICE SPIKE INCHOLERA MEDICINE.
YOU KNOW, THIS ALL REMINDS ME OFKIND OF A WONDERFUL BEDTIME
STORY THAT MY BUBBY USED TO TELLME, MY GRANDMOTHER.
SHE USED TO SAY, "THERE WAS AWOMAN, JONATHAN, WHO HAD
TYPHOID.
HER NAME WAS MARY.
SHE WAS A COOK, AND BECAUSE SHEHAD TYPHOID AND DIDN'T WASH HER
HANDS, SHE KILLED EVERYONE."
( LAUGHTER )"GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PEA."
SO, LISTEN, SENATOR-- LISTENSENATOR DUNG HANDS VON FECAL
FINGERS, YOU THINK WE COULD DO ABETTER JOB OF ENFORCING
REGULATIONS OR STREAMLININGREGULATIONS OR CREATING
REGULATIONS THAT MAKE SENSE ANDAREN'T ONEROUS?
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
BUT EMPLOYEES MUST DE-POOP
BEFORE SERVING FOOD TO THEPUBLIC AND MOST OF THE RULES
LIKE THAT DIDN'T COME UP BECAUSEGOVERNMENT IS ONEROUS OR IN THE
POCKET OF BIG SOFT SOAP.
SO DON'T PRETEND LIKE WE DON'TNEED ANY OF THEM.
BECAUSE TRUST ME-- IF THIS LADYIS MAKING YOUR MORNING ROAST,
YOU WANT HER TO WASH HER HANDS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
