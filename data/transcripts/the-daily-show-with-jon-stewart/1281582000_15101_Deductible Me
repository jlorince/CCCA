>> Jon: THOMAS JEFFERSON!
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW", MY
NAME IS JON STEWART, WE'VE GOT A
SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
THE VERY TALENTED LAURA LINNEY
IS HERE.
WE BROUGHTER IN TONIGHT
SPECIFICALLY TO CLASS THE JOINT
UP.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE'S VERY CLASSY AND WE'RE
HOPING THAT I WILL SOMEHOW
BALANCE HER OUT AND WE'LL HAVE A
NEUTRAL PROGRAM.
VERY CLASSY AND BEARDIE
McIDIOT.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN
WASHINGTON, D.C
IT'S OUR NATION'S CAPITAL.
FOR THE LAST 18 OR SO MONTHS
BARACK OBAMA'S BEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATS HAVE
CONTROLLED BOTH HOUSES OF
CONGRESS.
PURELY BY COINCIDENCE, THAT'S
THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE EXPRESSED
A NEWFOUND CONCERN FOR OUR
NATION'S FINANCIAL STABILITY.
(LAUGHTER).
>> SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL.
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEFICIT
THIS YEAR $1.8 TRILLION.
>> PEOPLE ARE AGHAST.
>> THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH ABOUT
THE FUTURE FOR THEIR KIDS AND
THEIR GRAND KIDS.
>> GENUINELY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN BEING
CRUSHED.
>> Jon: THE DEFICIT WANTS TO
SKULL [NO AUDIO] YOUR MOTHER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT WANTS TO EAT YOUR CHILDREN!
AFTER IT SHOWS YOUR WIFE A LEVEL
OF PHYSICAL PASSION YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO GIVE.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S A POWERFUL DEFICIT IS WHAT
I'M SAYING.
WELL, THERE IS GOOD NEWS FOR
CONCERNED REPUBLICANS.
YOUR PRAYERS TO THE GOD OF
UNCRUSHED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN
ANSWERED.
>> YOU SEE, GEORGE BUSH'S
MASSIVE TAX CUTS ARE THE
SINGLE-LARGEST CHUNK OF OUR
STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT.
WERE THE TAX CUTS TO EXPIRE, THE
BUDGET DEFICIT WOULD INSTANTLY
SHRINK BY ABOUT 30%, OR MORE
THAN $300 BILLION.
>> Jon: THAT 3D ANIMATRONIC
VERSION OF FAREED SAA CAR YA IS
RIGHT.
HANDSOME.
LETTING THE BUSH TAX CUTS EXPIRE
SHRINK IT IS DEFICIT BY 30%.
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THE BUSH
TAX CUTS ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE
AT THE END OF 2010, THE VERY
YEAR REPUBLICANS HAVE EXPRESSED
CONCERN ABOUT DEFICIT REDUCTION.
I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES
TOGETHER!
>> LET'S EXTEND THE TAX CUTS.
>> LET'S GO WITH KENT CONRAD'S
PLAN AND EXTEND THE TAX CUTS FOR
TWO YEARS.
>> I AM NOT FOR RAISING TAXES ON
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> WE CAN NOT ALLOW OR EVEN TALK
OF RAISING TAXES RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: OH MY... DO THEY NOT
REALIZE THAT THE TAX CUTS
STRENGTHEN THE DEFICIT MONSTER
THAT'S GOING TO EAT OUR BABIES?
(LAUGHTER)
HOW EXACTLY CAN YOU BE FOR
DEFICIT REDUCTION AND EXTENDING
TAX CUTS?
HOW THE DO THOSE TWO
DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED THOUGHTS
EXIST IN THE SAME PARTY
PLATFORM.
>> THEY KNOW WE HAVE TO EXTEND
THE BUSH TAX CUTS, THEY HAVE TO
REPEAL THE BUDGET-BUSTING BILLS
LIKE OBAMA-CARE.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
SHE'S GOT THEM EXISTING IN THE
SAME SENTENCE!
(LAUGHTER)
AND I SAY TO YOU SARAH PALIN
THAT A SENTENCE DIVIDED AGAINST
CANNOT STAND.
COMMA, PERIOD, EXCLAMATION
POINT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHY LINCOLN'S WORDS ARE IN
KENNEDY'S MOUTH...
(LAUGHTER).
NOT REALLY SURE WHY THAT
HAPPENED.
I GUESS IT'S BETTER THAN DOING
IT AS JACKIE MASON.
(AS JACKIE MASON)
WE CAN'T LET THE SENTENCE
DIVIDE...
(LAUGHTER).
HOW CAN YOU ARGUE THAT?
IT JUST... MY THINKING BEARD IS
GONE!
WELL, THE... THEY MUST HAVE AN
EXPLANATION FOR THIS.
>> YOU'RE SAYING EXTEND THE TAX
CUTS THAT AREN'T PAID FOR AND
CUT THE DEFICIT?
>> I THINK IT'S APPLES AND
ORANGES.
>> Jon: YES, YES.
IN THE SENSE THAT FOR NO
DISCERNIBLE REASON YOU LOVE
APPLES AND THINK ORANGES ARE
RUINING THE COUNTRY.
(LAUGHTER)
TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT THIS.
WHY ARE THEY DIFFERENT?
>> THEY TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS THE
SAME WAY THEY TALK ABOUT
SPENDING INCREASES AS THOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT OWNED ALL OF THE
MONEY.
THEY SAY ARE THEY PAID FOR?
WELL, I THINK DECIDING ON A
GOVERNMENT SPENDING INCREASE IS
VERY DIFFERENT ON WHETHER OR NOT
WE ALLOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO
KEEP MORE OF THEIR HARD-EARNED
TAX DOLLARS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
MONEY THE GOVERNMENT GETS IS
VERY IF HE WANT THAN MONEY THE
GOVERNMENT SPENDS?
OKAY.
BUT YOU'RE FOR DEFICIT
REDUCTION.
AND I BELIEVE THE DEFICIT'S
OPINION ON THAT ISSUE CAN BEST
BE SUMMED UP WITH THIS.
>> BUSINESS BAD?
[NO AUDIO], PAY ME.
YOU HAD A FIRE?
[NO AUDIO] YOU, PAY ME.
PLACE GOT HIT BY LIGHTNING, HUH?
[NO AUDIO] YOU, PAY ME.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: DEFICIT DOESN'T CARE
WHERE IT COMES FROM.
ULTIMATELY, IT BOILS DOWN TO, IN
MIKE SPENCE'S OPINION, APPLES
AND ORANGES.
AND SPEAKING OF ORANGES, WHAT
DOES HOUSE MINORITY LEADER AND
RETIRED SYRACUSE MASCOT JOHN
BOEHNER THINK IS THE ANSWER?
>> THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO
GET OUR ECONOMY GOING AGAIN AND
SO OUR BUDGET PROBLEMS IS TO GET
THE ECONOMY MOVING.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: THE ONLY WAY TO GET
OUR ECONOMY GOING IS TO GET IT
MOVING?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS EITHER THE MOST PROFOUND
OR MOST RETARDED STATEMENT I'VE
EVER HEARD.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY... NO, WAIT.
WAIT.
IN FACT, IT'S THE MOST
PROFOUNDLY RETARDED STATEMENT
I'VE EVER HEARD
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S THE KIND OF STATEMENT YOU
THINK WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE
PHRASE "IN BED."
(LAUGHTER)
IT MAKES... BY THE WAY, DIDN'T
THAT CAT USED TO BE ORANGE?
(LAUGHTER)
NOW HE'S LIKE A DIFFERENT
BROWNISH... EITHER HE'S GETTING
READY TO PLAY AN ININDIAN IN A
1950s WESTERN...
(LAUGHTER).
... OR JOHN BOEHNER-- AND I
BELIEVE THIS MAY BE THE CASE--
IS NOT HUMAN BUT ACTUALLY MADE
ENTIRELY OF CURED MEATS.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M SAYING.
(APPLAUSE)
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HE IS... HE IS PERHAPS SKWERBGY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE LACK OF SPES F.I.S. CITY
JUST ONE PART OF THE REPUBLICAN
ECONOMIC PLAN, NOW FIND THE
CREAMY CARAMEL NOUGATY CENTER
YOU MUST FIND THE UNDERPINNINGS
OF THE REPUBLICAN ECONOMIC PLAN.
FOR THAT, WE GO TO ONE OF THE
BRAINS OF THE OPERATION.
>> THE JOB-KILLING NATURE OF THE
OEUB/REID/PELOSI TEAM IS THE
FIRST BIG CHALLENGE WE'RE FACED
WITH AS A COUNTRY.
PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T
KNOW AND PART OF IT IS FRANKLY
BECAUSE THEY'RE SOCIALIST AND
THEY DON'T CARE.
>> Jon: WOW, SO TO THE PLAN TO
RETURN THE TAX RATE FOR ANY
HOUSEHOLD MAKING OVER $250,000
IN 2010 STILL LOWER THAN UNDER
RONALD REAGAN IS AN ACTIVE
SOCIALIST PLOT TO RUIN THE
ECONOMY.
AND WE ALL KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO COUNTER A SOCIALIST PLOT.
>> YOU WANT TO CREATE JOBS AS
RAPIDLY AS CHINA?
THE CHINESE PAY ZERO CAPITAL
GAINS TAX.
IF WE HAD ZERO CAPITAL GAINS TAX
IN THE UNITED STATES, WE'D BE
BUILDING FACTORIES, FOUNDING
COMPANIES, CREATING JOBS.
WE'D BE DRAMATICALLY BETTER OFF.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: SO THAT'S THE
REPUBLICAN PLAN.
TO FIGHT SOCIALISM, WE MUST
