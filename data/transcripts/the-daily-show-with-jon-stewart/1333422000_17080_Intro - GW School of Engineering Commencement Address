>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BOOM.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
MY GUEST, MOHAMMED NASHEED,
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE MALDIVES.
AND CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS.
CLIMATE CHANGE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MALDIVES BECAUSE THEY WERE ALMOST UNDERWATER.
I WAS IN WASHINGTON D.C. THIS WEEK AT THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOCIAL CAUSES
AND COMMIT MANYS THAT THEY'RE ALL WORKING ON FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE
WORLD WERE GATHERED THERE.
I MET THIS KID WHO HAD MADE...
HE AND HIS TWO FRIENDS MADE BAMBOO BICYCLES.
IT WON THE LITTLE COMPETITION THEY HAD AMONGST ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS.
INCREDIBLE.
BACK STAGE HE SAYS TO ME, HEY,
LISTEN, YOU KNOW, I'M FROM THE G.W.SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING.
WE'RE HAVING OUR COMMENCEMENT.
I WAS LIKE, HERE WE GO.
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO EXPLAIN NOW I THINK I'M BUSY THAT...
THAT SEASON.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HE GOES, SO, DO YOU KNOW NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON?
COULD YOU ASK HIM IF HE WOULD DO OUR COMMENCEMENT?
SO, CONSIDER HIM ASKED.
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON,
G.W.SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING.
THEY MAKE BAMBOO
