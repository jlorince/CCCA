WE WERE THINKING 1980 IS APERIOD PIECE.
BECAUSE THE DISTANCE OF TIMEBETWEEN 1980 AND NOW IS THE SAME
AMOUNT BETWEEN 1980 AND WORLDWAR II.
>> HURTS, DOESN'T IT?
>> Jon: IT REALLY...

A PERIOD PIECE AND MY MOTHER WASMORTIFIED.

HAD DONE THE YEAR BEFORE.
I KNOW I'M SLOW TO CATCH UP ONTHINGS.

LITTLE BIT MORE AHEAD OF THINGSTHAN THAT.
I'M PLAYING A SPY, I'M AN ACTIONHERO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon: THIS IS THE FIRST...
>> THEY APPLAUD BEFORE THEY'VESEEN IT.
>> Jon: THIS IS EXCITING. THISSTORY, THE ONE IN THIS,
THE GENTLEMAN YOU AREPORTRAYING, THIS IS A TRUE STORY
THIS IS A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS HELDIN THAILAND.
>> CAPTURED IN SINGAPORE, TAKENTO THAILAND BASICALLY AS AN ARMY
OF SLAVES TO DO THIS IMPOSSIBLETASK OF BUILDING A RAILWAY
THROUGH THE JUNGLE.
IT WAS AN ACT OF MASS MURDER.
AND MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE DIDDIE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS.
IT'S THE MOST EXTREME BRUTALITYYOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
HE SURVIVED IT.
HE, LIKE MOST PEOPLE, VETERANSOF THAT EXPERIENCE, BOTTLED IT
UP FOR DECADES.
HE THRIVED ON HATRED. HE WANTEDVENGENCE.
>> Jon: WELL, THIS IS ABOUT THETRAUMA, THE P.T.S.D. THAT HE
EXPERIENCES IN FLASHBACKS.
>> EXACTLY, WHICH PROBABLYDIDN'T HAVE A NAME AT THE TIME.
HE FOUND RATHER MIRACULOUSLYFOUND THE GUY HE WAS LOOKING
FOR.
FOUND HIM TO STILL BE ALIVE ANDWENT OUT TO KILL HIM.
THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO THE SCENEYOU SAW THERE.
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU HOW THATSCENE ENDS.
IT'S PHENOMENAL.
( LAUGHTER )THE GENTLEMAN IS NO LONGER WITH
US, BUT HIS WIFE IS.
YOU MET HER.
>> I MET THEM BOTH.
ERIC PASSED AWAY ABOUT A YEARAND A HALF AGO.
>> Jon: OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE.

WAS MOST...
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: ...IN THE FRONT OF YOURMIND.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WHEN THAT WAS DELIVEREDTO YOU IN I'M ASSUMING A
POSITIVE FASHION BECAUSESHE'S STILL WITH THE THING,
WAS THAT A WEIGHT OFFYOUR SHOULDERS?
>> A WEIGHT OFF AND THEN ON.
BECAUSE OF COURSE, IF SHE HADWITHHELD APPROVAL, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW WE WOULDHAVE GOT GOING.
THE FACT THAT WE WERE THENTRUSTED TO TAKE THIS PRECIOUS
STORY.
AND THE REASON IT'S PRECIOUS ISTHAT OUT OF THIS WALL OF
SILENCE THIS MANSPOKE. AND IT WAS AT GREAT COST
TO HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUTWHAT HAPPENED.
HE WAS SPEAKING FOR THOUSANDS OFPEOPLE WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN AND
HE'S SAYING OVER TO YOU.
A GUY TO WHOM NOTHING HASHAPPENED EVER.
>> Jon: I HEARD YOU WENT JOGGINGONCE.
>> I WENT JOGGING AND SOMEBODYWAS MEAN TO ME AT SCHOOL ONCE.
( LAUGHTER )SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO
DRAW ON.
AND, YOU KNOW, TO TAKE THIS HUGESTORY AND YOU'VE GOT 90 MINUTES
OF SCREEN TIME TO BE TRUE TO ITWAS... IT WAS AN INCENTIVE BUT,
YEAH THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT ONONE SHOULDER.
