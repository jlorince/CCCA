I AM ANNOUNCING A PROGRAMTONIGHT TO SAVE THE ENDANGERED
GUINEA WORM.
THERE ARE ONLY 129 OF THEMLEFT IN THIS --
>> 126.
>> Jon: 6.
YOU'RE, YOU'RE,YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
OBVIOUSLY THE EVENTS INTHE WORLD THIS WEEK WERE
TRAGIC.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TAKING ALOT OF STICK FOR NOT GOING TO
PARIS TO MARCH IN SOLIDARITY.WHEN TITO DIED IN YUGOSLAVIA
YOU DID NOT GO.>> YES.
>> YOU ALSO TOOK A FAIR AMOUNTOF HEAT FOR THAT. WHAT DOES
THAT FEEL LIKE AND WHAT ISTHE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
TO SAY YEAH I'M GOING TO GO,I'M NOT GOING TO GO?
IS IT POLITICAL, IS IT PERSONAL?WHAT'S -- HOW DOES THAT GO?
>> I THINK IT'S BOTH.
POLITICAL AND PERSONAL.
FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS ATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT
THAT HAS TO BE MADE FOR APRESIDENT TO GO SOMEWHERE WITH
A 36 HOUR NOTICE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW ITWOULD BE VERY
DIFFICULT FOR PRESIDENTOBAMA TO GO AT THE LAST
MINUTE.
SECONDLY, HE HAS A LOT OFOTHER DUTIES TO PERFORM.
YOU KNOW, HE HAS BEEN ONVACATION FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
I'M SURE HIS REQUESTS HAVE PILEDUP THIS HIGH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO I DON'T BLAME HIM AT ALLFOR NOT GOING.
AND AS YOU KNOW, JOHN KERRY, THESECRETARY OF STATE SPEAKS
FLUENT FRENCH AND HE WAS THEFIRST ONE WHO SENT CONDOLENCES
AND A BOND OF COMMONCOMMITMENT TO FREEDOM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO THE FRENCH PEOPLE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW,
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO ME, WHENYOU THINK BACK TO THE LAST,
I MEAN, OSLO THERE WAS ACERTAIN HOPE, BUT THAT
CAMP DAVID PEACE ACCORD.
THERE WAS A REAL SENSE OFHOPE DURING THAT TIME.
>> THERE WAS.
>> Jon: THAT IT, IS ITHEARTENING TO YOU TO THINK
WE CAN GET BACK TO THATFEELING OR DISHEARTENING TO
SEE HOW MANY YEARS HAVE GONEBY WITH THE REDUNDANCY OF
THIS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE?
>> DISHEARTERNING.
>> Jon: DISHEARTENING.
>> ABSOLUTELY. WELL, AT LEASTTHE PALESTINIAN LEADER AND THE
ISRAELI ARE AT OPPOSITE ENDSOF THE LINE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> MAYBE SOME DAY THEY WILLCOME TOGETHER.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THEY WERE BOTH INPARIS MARCHING.
>> THEY WERE BOTH THERE.
AND WE STILL HAVE A HOPEFOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
BUT IT'S A DISTANT HOPE. AND ITHINK THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE
THAT HAPPEN, THE UNITED STATESHAS GOT TO
BE IN THE FOREFRONT OFDEMANDING THAT BOTH THE
PALESTINIANS AND THEISRAELIS COME TOGETHER AND
ACCEPT A REASONABLE SOLUTIONTO THE PROBLEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ISRAELIES HAVE TO WITHDRAWFROM THE WEST BANK AND GAZA
AND EAST JERUSALEM AS WELLAND THE PALESTINIANS HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT THEY COMMITTHEMSELVES WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION
TO THE FREEDOM OF ISRAEL TO LIVEIN PEACE ALONGSIDE OF THEM.
>> Jon: NOW THIS EXTREMISMIN THAT REGION WAS AROUND
DURING SADAT'S TIME.
>> OH YES, IT WAS.>> Jon: AS WELL.
>> THEY HAD FOUR WARS IN 25YEARS BEFORE I BECAME
PRESIDENT.
AND WHEN I GOT BEGIN ANDSADAT TOGETHER AT CAMP DAVID,
IN ONE OF THE ROOMS IN MY CABINWHERE ROSE AND I LIVED,
FOR THE FIRST THREE DAYS,ALL THEY DID WAS SHOUT AT
EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT HADHAPPENED IN THOSE FOUR WARS.
SOMETIMES THEY WENT BACK TOOLD TESTAMENT TIMES,
BUT THEY SHOUTED. SO THEY --
>> Jon: WOULD THEY REALLY? THEYWOULD CARRY IT BACK.
>> AFTER THREE DAYS, I GAVE UPON THEM.
SO I TOLD THEM, BEGIN YOU STAYIN YOUR CABIN, SADAT YOU STAY IN
YOUR CABIN AND I WILL GO BACKAND FORTH BETWEEN THEM.
SO FOR TEN DAYS THEY DIDTHAT.
>> Jon: CAN YOU GIVE WORLDLEADERS A TIME OUT?
IS THAT, IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> WELL, NOT NOW.
>> Jon: NOT NOW. IT DOESN'TWORK.
>> NOT NOW AT THE CARTERCENTER.
WHEN I WAS IN THE WHITEHOUSE, MAYBE I COULD.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK --EXACTLY.
WHY DO YOU THINK, YOU KNOW,I VIEW THIS EXTREMISM
AS A FUNCTION OF, SORT OF APRETEXT. YOU KNOW, THEY, IT'S,
THIS IDEA THAT IT'S ARELIGIOUS BACKING SEEMS A
PRETEXT FOR JUST POWERLESS --YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ANGRY,
NIHILISTIC, IT DOESN'TSEEM --
>> THAT'S TRUE.>> Jon: IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A
RELIGIOUS PART TO IT, ITWOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE.
THEY WOULD USE SOME OTHERPRETEXT TO BE VIOLENT IN
THIS WAY. DO, IS THAT --
>> WELL, ONE OF THE ORIGINS FORIT IS THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM.
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS AGGRAVATESPEOPLE WHO ARE AFFILIATED ANY
WAY WITH THE ARAB PEOPLE WHOLIVE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA.
WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW,WHAT'S BEING DONE TO THEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK THAT'S PART OFIT. BUT I THINK THIS IS A NEW
EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT INTERRORISM.
WHERE PEOPLE GO INTO SYRIA,THEY GET TRAINED THERE, THEY
HAVE A PASSPORT FROM FRANCE,FROM GREAT BRITAIN OR FROM THE
UNITED STATES.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY STAY THERE FOR A FEWMONTHS, LEARN HOW TO BE A
TERRORIST, AND THEN THEY COMEBACK THROUGH TURKEY AND YOU
KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN THEREAND YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
AND I THINK THIS EVENT, ANDPARIS IS GOING TO WAKEN UP
THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OFSECURITY TO WATCH THOSE
PEOPLE MORE CLOSELY THANTHEY HAVE IN THE PAST.
AND NOT SINGLE OUT ALL OFTHE, ALL OF THE MUSLIMS IN
OUR COUNTRY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NO, AND IT ISHARD, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE A
VERY SMALL AMOUNT OFPEOPLE CAN NOW DO A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DAMAGE.
BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE THEMGOING ANY FURTHER THAN THAT,
IN TERMS OF THEIR SELLINGPOINT TO THE WORLD.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THIS IS A BIGPROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN BUT THEIR
SELLING POINT TO THE WORLD SEEMSTO BE JOIN US, WE'RE CRAZY.
>> YEAH.>> Jon: WE'LL KILL EVERYBODY.
>> I KNOW --
>> Jon: THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BEA GOVERNINGING PHILOSOPHY.
>> I WAS ENCOURAGED, THOUGH,  AFEW MINUTES AGO TO SEE THIS
MUSLIM REALLY CONDEMN -- .
>> Jon: NO, I THINK YOU'RERIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE TERRORISM. WELL, THIS ISA GOOD OMEN, YOU KNOW --
>> Jon: YEAH.>> FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE I KNOW
ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE WATCHTHIS PROGRAM AND SO THERE'S
GOING TO BE A TRANSFORMATION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NO, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IHAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT,
WE'RE PART OF THE SOLUTION.
SO, ALWAYS SAID THAT. IT'SALWAYS A DELIGHT TO SEE YOU.
ANY DISEASES ON THE HORIZONYOU ARE GOING TO BE CURING?
ANYTHING WESHOULD KEEP OUR EYES OUT FOR?
>> OH, YOU KNOW,
RIVER BLINDNESS ANDONCHOCERCIASIS, AS WELL AS
TRACHOMA AND LYMPHATICFILARIASIS AND SCHISTOSOMIASIS.
JUST A FEW OF THOSE STILL OVERTHERE. WE WORK --
>> Jon: WILL YOU ADOPT ME? ISTHERE ANY?
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO, DEFEATINGDISEASE.
