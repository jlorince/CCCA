LAST WEEK WE CONFIDENT THE CANDIDATES FIRST EVER AMERICAN STYLE DEBATE BETWEEN LABOR PRIME
MINISTER GORDAN BROWN AND CANDIDATES.
IN THE SECOND DEBATE THE CANDIDATES CAME OUT SWINGING.
>> WITH YOU NOW WITHDRAW?
WILL YOU WITHDRAW THE LEAFLETS THAT ARE GOING OUT ROUND THE COUNTRY?
>> Jon: OH, (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
I HOPE I AVOIDED THE BLEEP ON THAT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE CAMERON WENT TO THE LEAFLETS.
I BET THEY ACCUSED CAMERON OF SOMETHING TERRIBLE LIKE SELLING OUT BRITISH INTEREST TO THE EU
OR PALLING AROUND WITH IRA TERRORISTS LIKE BILL O'AYERS.
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
>> WILL YOU WITHDRAW THE LEAFLETS GOING OUT SAYING THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD TAKE AWAY
THINGS LIKE THE FREE BUS PASS?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THERE'S A DEBATE OVER WHO CONTROLS ENGLAND COMES DOWN
TO THE EXPLOSIVE FREE BUS PASS ISSUE.

YOU DO KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
THE HEIRS OF CHURCHILL ARE FIGHTING OVER THE 70P FARE FROM FROM -- NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF
TRAVEL HAVE SO MANY PAID SO LITTLE TO TRAVEL SO FAR.
AS MY CHURCHILL SOUNDS LIKE KENNEDY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT -- I DON'T KNOW WHY.

[LAUGHTER]
I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH THAT BUS PASS.
[LAUGHTER]
BUS LEWINSKY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
THE STORY OF FIRST DEBATE WAS THE RISE OF LIB-DEM NICK KLEG AND THE CORRESPONDING FALL OF
LABOR'S GORDON BROWN.
THE BIG QUESTION IN DEBATE NUMBER TWO WOULD THE PRIME MINISTER RECOVER?
>> DAVID YOU ARE A RISK TO THE ECONOMY.
NICK YOU ARE A RISK BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ON IRAN AND NUCLEAR SECURITY.
NICK WOULD YOU LEAVE US WEAK.
DAVID YOU WOULD LEAVE US ISOLATED IN EUROPE.
>> Jon: DAVID YOU ARE BANGERS HAVE NO MASH AND YOUR DICKS BOTH SPOTTED.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YES, GORDON BROWN HAS REBROWNED AFTER THE SECOND DEBATE.
HE LOOKED TO KEEP THAT MOMENTUM GOING WITH A LITTLE WALKING TOUR AROUND LABOR'S STRONGHOLD.
HELLO, NICE TO SIGH.
LOVELY.
HELLO, HERE IS THE LOVELY LADY LET'S HAVE A CHAT, SHALL WE?
>> I'M THINKING ABOUT MY GRANDCHILDREN.
