FEATURED IN THE NEW DOCUMENTARYFILM, "RED ARMY."
>> I BELONG TO THE RED NATION.
IF YOU WEAR THE NATIONALUNIFORM, THAT'S YOUR DUTY TO
DO YOUR BEST TO REPRESENT YOURCOUNTRY.
FOR THE SOVIETS, SPORTS WEREIN A WAY A KIND OF WARFARE.

BECAUSE OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM,BECAUSE OF SOCIALISM, THAT'S
WHY WE'RE THE BEST.

I AM A GREAT ADMIRER OF YOU.
NOT JUST AS A HOCKEY PLAYER,BUT FOR YOUR COURAGE.
HOCKEY IN THE '80s AND '90sREALLY DID STAND IN FOR BOTH
OUR COUNTRIES AS A KIND OFPROXY BATTLE OF IDEOLOGIES.

GAMES AND TO REPRESESNT YOURCOUNTRIES.

THE UNITED STATES.

CONDITIONS.
