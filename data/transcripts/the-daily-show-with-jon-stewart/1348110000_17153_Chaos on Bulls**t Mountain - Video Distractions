DON'T SUMMIT BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND A TURD OR TWO.
THIS VERY POPULAR, DEFINITELY EFFECTIVE WINNING POLITICAL ARGUMENT THAT ROMNEY'S MAKING...
>> IT'S ANOTHERRERFECT DISTRACTION FROM THE 14% UNEMPLOYMENT, INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE
DAY, LIKE $6 TRILLION IN DEBT AND THE MIDDLE EAST IS BURNING.
INSTEAD WE'RE SITTING AROUND GOING, DID ROMNEY INSULT THE COUNTRY OR NOT.
>> YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DISCUSS SERIOUS ISSUES TODAY ON THE CAMPAIGN.
YOU HAVE THE MOVE ON THE SECRETLY RECORDED VIDEOS.
>> Jon: YOU JUST WANT THE TALK ABOUT REAL ISSUES, SO HAVE AT IT.
>> A NEW RECORDING SURFACES, THIS TIME IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO GETS CAUGHT.
>> IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TURN TO BE HAUNTED BY SOMETHING HE SAID ONCE UPON A TIME.
>> Jon: ARE THERE NO RULES ON BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN?
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, I EXPECT THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR FROM PEOPLE LIVING AT ASSHOLE COVE, BUT NOT... SO RECORDED VIDEOS ARE A DISTRACTION.
HERE'S ONE FROM OBAMA.
THE OBAMA VIDEO IS PERTINENT, BUT THE ROMNEY VIDEO IS A DISTRACTION.
WHY?
>> IT FEATURES GOVERNOR ROMNEY SPEAKING TO SUPPORTERS AT A FUND-RAISER WAY BACK IN MAY.
>> Jon: OH, THIS VIDEO IS FROM WAY BACK IN MAY, MAY, OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS LIKE BEFORE JUNE.
[LAUGHTER]
WHO EVEN REMEMBERS MAY.
GRANDFATHER, MAY I SIT ON YOUR KNEE AND HERE YOU TELLTALE OF WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE WAY BACK IN MAY?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, KIDDY, HOLD ON NOW.
I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
THE iPHONE 5 WAS BUT A GLIMMER IN THE iPHONE 4S'S EYE.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME.
NOW IN HANNITY'S DEFENSE, FOUR MONTHS IS TYPICALLY ENOUGH TIME FOR ROMNEY TO RADICALLY CHANGE HIS POSITION.
BY THE WAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS NEW VERY PERTINENT VIDEO OF OBAMA THAT FOX HAS MADE HAY OF ALL DAY, WHEN WAS THAT VIDEO RECORDED?
>> 1998.
>> Jon: MY GOD!
THAT'S MORE THAN 14 MAYS AGO.
