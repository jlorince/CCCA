>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS WILL BE JOINING US.
MR. STEPHANAPOLOUS WILL BE OUT HERE IN A LITTLE BIT.
WE'LL TALK TO HIM VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO BE UP IN LIKE TWO HOURS.
BIG NEWS FROM VATICAN CITY TONIGHT.
>> POPE BENEDICT XVI ANNOUNCING HE IS STEPPING DOWN AS LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
>> Jon: POPES CAN DO THAT?
I ASSUMED THE PAPACY WAS LIKE A LIFETIME COMMITMENT LIKE BEING IN THE MOB OR BEING A
CORRESPONDENT ON "60 MINUTES." IN ANY CASE WE'LL BRING YOU FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF THE POPE'S
RESIGNATION IN "HOLY QUIT." HOW IS IT GOING WITH THAT POPEY CHANGEY THING?
NOW, THE POPE HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT CITING THE GROWING TOLL OF HIS ADVANCED AGE LEAVING
HIM ILL SUITED FOR HIS MINISTRY.
BUT POPES USUALLY DON'T RETIRE UNTIL THEY ARE CALLED BACK TO THE HOME OFFICE.
THIS HASN'T HAPPENED IN 600 YEARS.
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION WOULD BE...
>> WHAT DOES A RETIRED POPE DO?
'S A RETIRED POPE TO DO?
DO RETIRED POPES DO?
Jon: I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR BUT IF I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RETIRED PEOPLE PROBABLY
THE SAME AS WHAT THEY ALL DO.
â™ª WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DOES HE DO?
HE'S AN 85-YEAR-OLD.
WHAT DOES HE DO?
HE SITS ON HIS PORCH IN A TRACK SUIT AND WRAP-AROUND SUNGLASSES AND HE YELLS AT THE NEIGHBOR'S KIDS.
MAYBE HE PUTTERS AROUND IN GARDEN WATCHING A LITTLE DAYTIME TV AND SOMEONE NOTICES THAT THE
MAIL HAS PILED UP FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THE HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET.
THE CYCLE... YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO 85 YEAR OLDS.
WAIT FOR THE WHITE SMOKE TO COME OUT OF THE CHIMNEY.
BUT SINCE YOU BRING IT UP, WHAT IS THE POPE'S PLAN
>> HE'LL DO WHAT HE'S BEEN WANTING TO DO FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS TO READ BOOKS AND TO PRAY.
>> Jon: ISN'T THAT WHAT THE POPE WAS DOING?
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE ONLY THING HE'S LOSING
