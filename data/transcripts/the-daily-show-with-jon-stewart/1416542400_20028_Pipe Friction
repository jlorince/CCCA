>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW.
MY NAME'S JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM "THETHEORY OF EVERYTHING" INCREDIBLE
PERFORMANCE EDDIE REDMAYNE ISGONNA BE JOINING US ON THE
PROGRAM TONIGHT.
BUT FIRST, AS YOU MAY REMEMBERDEMOCRATS TOOK A BIT OF A BALL
SMASHING.
[LAUGHTER]IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION BUT ONE
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR STILL HAS ACHANCE.
>> IN LOUISIANA DEMOCRATICINCUMBENT SENATOR
MARY LANDRIEU IS FACING ADECEMBER RUNOFF ELECTION AGAINST
REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERBILL CASSIDY.
>> HER OPPONENTS POLL SHOW HIMUP BY 16 POINTS AND ANOTHER
POLL SHOWED HIM UP BY ABOUT 20.
>> Jon:  SO, HE'S UP BY 20POINTS.
SENATOR LANDRIEU FACES A RUNOFFELECTION WITH BILL CASSIDY
IN MUCH THE SAME WAY A SKIERMIGHT FACE A RUNOFF
ELECTION WITH AN AVALANCHE. BUTTHE RACE ISN'T OVER YET!
THERE'S STILL TIME FOR ONE LASTHAIL MARY LANDRIEU.
>> THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN SIXYEARS IN THE MAKING BUT THE
TIMING OF THE HOUSE AND SENATEVOTES WERE POLITICS PURE AND
SIMPLE.
THE HOUSE WILL BASS INTRODUCEDBY LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN BILL
CASSIDY.
THE SENATE BILL BY LOUISIANADEMOCRAT MARY LANDRIEU.
>> Jon:  OH MY GOD, THAT'S SOEMBARRASSING.
THEY BOTH WORE THE SAMETRANSPARENT PLOY TO CONGRESS.
THAT'S JUST A SHAME.
BUT YOU KNOW THE KEYSTONEPIPELINE'S LONG BEEN AN
ENVIRONMENTAL BUGABOO.
YOU CAN NEVER PASS THEDEMOCRATICALLY HELD SENATE,
UNLESS THEY WERE WILLING TO SELLOUT A CORE CONSTITUENCY AND VOTE
FOR THIS KEYSTONE PIPELINE BILLJUST TO SAVE ONE SENATE SEAT
THAT DOESN'T EVEN CHANGE THEBALANCE OF POWER.
>> TO BOOST LANDRIEU'S CHANCESAT THE POLLS SOME OF HER FELLOW
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE DROPPEDTHEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon:  BUT I JUST SAID THAT
WOULD BE A STUPID THING TO DO.
[LAUGHTER]SO THE PARTY THAT LOST THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS BECAUSE ITDIDN'T STAND FOR ANYTHING, HAS
DECIDED OH I'VE GOT AN IDEA!
WHAT IF WE STOOD FOR LESS?
[LAUGHTER]OR MAYBE THE RIGHT TO DROP THEIR
OBJECTIONS.
WHAT EXACTLY IS THEKEYSTONE XL PIPELINE?
>> THE PIPELINE WOULD SEND TARSANDS OIL FROM ALBERTA, CANADA
TO NEBRASKA WHERE IT WOULDHOOK UP WITH EXISTING
PIPELINE TO GO TO REFINERIES ONTHE GULF COAST.
IT WOULD CARRY MORE THAN 800,000BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL A DAY.
>> Jon:  BECAUSE APPARENTLYTHE OLD METHOD OF SIMPLY
OVERNIGHTING OIL WASN'T WORKINGOUT VERY WELL.
[LAUGHTER]ANY PROJECT THIS LARGE AND
CONTROVERSIAL IS BOUND TO BECOMPLICATED.
SO I THINK BEFORE WE ALL MAKE UPOUR MINDS, I THINK WE SHOULD
HEAR THE PROS AND CONS.
HOW MANY JOBS WOULD THIS PROJECTCREATE?
>> WE CAN BILL THE KEYSTONEPIPELINE CREATING THOUSANDS OF
TEMPORARY AND MILLIONS OFPERMANENT JOBS,
>> THE CEO WHO RUNSTHE PIPELINE SAYS THERE WILL BE
35 PERMANENT JOBS.
>> Jon:  OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]SOMEWHERE BETWEEN...
[LAUGHTER]... MILLIONS OF JOBS AND 35.
[LAUGHTER]SO, LET'S JUST SAY THE KEYSTONE
PIPELINE WILL CREATE SOME JOBSWITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF ...
[LAUGHTER]... ALMOST ALL NUMBERS.
[LAUGHTER]ALTHOUGH JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING
COULD CREATE JOBS DOESN'T MEANIT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU COULD HIREAT LEAST A HUNDRED PEOPLE TO
CHISEL DICKS ON MOUNT RUSHMORE.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD DOIT. OF COURSE --
[APPLAUSE]HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
HAVE YOU BEEN TO MOUNTRUSHMORE? HAVE YOU SEEN THAT?
IT'S A BIG TOURIST ATTRACTION.AND BY THE WAY, BY SAYING THIS I
MEAN NO DISRESPECT TO THE BOLDMEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK
LONG HOURS AT HIGH ALTITUDES INDANGEROUS CONDITIONS.
ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT OFENGINEERING.
MAY HISTORY NEVER FORGET THOSETHAT IT KNOWS ONLY AS THE CHISEL
DICKS.
THEIR FASCINATING STORY IS ALLIN MY NEW BOOK "CHISEL DICKS:
THE STORY OF DRAWINGDICKS ON MOUNT RUSHMORE."
SOON TO BE A DOCUMENTARY FILM BYKEITH BURNS.
NO RELATIONSHIP.
TELL ME MORE ABOUT THISPIPELINE.
>> KEYSTONE TAR SANDS PIPELINEWILL BE HARMFUL TO OUR FAMILY'S
HEALTH. IT WILL HURTTHE ENVIRONMENT.
>> PRESIDENT'S OWN STATEDEPARTMENT HAD FOUND THE
PIPELINE POSES NO MEANINGFULRISK TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
>> THIS GIVES US A CHANCE TO BEMORE SECURE AS A NATION AND MORE
INDEPENDENT FROM FOREIGN OIL.
>> IT DOES NOTHING FOR AMERICANENERGY SECURITY.
>> Jon: GREAT! SO IT LOOKS LIKETHE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS EITHER
A 1200 MILE LONG JOB CREATINGSLIP AND SLIDE MADE ON
OF OUT OF RAINBOWS ANDCHILDREN'S DREAMS.
OR THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER-SIZEDPOISON LADEN URETHRA OF SATAN
HIMSELF. THE TWO ARGUMENTS COULDNOT BE FURTHER APART, YOU HAVE
TO ASSUME THAT THE TRUTH ISPROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE
MIDDLE. I MEAN, ODDS ARE THISWILL CREATE JOBS AND HAVE
SOME SPILLS. WHAT'S ONESPILL HERE AND THERE?
>> ONE SPILL INTO OUR AQUIFERS,YOU KNOW, IT CAN SPREAD MILES.
IF OUR WATER IS CONTAMINATED WEHAVE NO WATER FOR THE CATTLE.
>> Jon: WELL THAT'S THE PROBLEMRIGHT THERE. YOU'RE STILL USING
THEM WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERETHOSE WATER BASE COWS.
YOUR PROBLEM THERE IS YOU GOT TOUPGRADE TO WHAT DO YOU CALL IT,
THE OIL BURNING COWS. GOT THEMOIL BURNING COWS.
THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.
PROBLEM SOLVED.
YOU JUST GOT TO GET THOSE COWSWITH THE TWO SMOKE --
DID YOU EVER SEE THOSE WHENYOU'RE DRIVING?
SO SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIESBATTLED FOR HOURS TO SWAY THE
PIPELINE VOTES AND APARENTLYALSO TO SEE IF THEY COULD MAKE
THE SENATE'S GIANT PRINTER RUNOUT OF TONER AND INK.
YOU KNOW, THE SADDEST THINGABOUT THAT RIGHT THERE ISN'T
THE PICTURE OF POLLUTED SKIES,I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE
THAT PICTURE, IT'S THAT SENATORBOXER MADE THAT AIDE HOLD
THAT GIANT PHOTO ASTHOUGH HE WERE A HUMAN EASEL.
WHEN THERE IS VERY CLEARLY AREGULAR NON-HUMAN EASEL JUST
TWO ROWS BACK.
IT IS UPSETTING.
BUT I GUESS THAT'S A WIN FOR THEREPUBLICANS.
PIPELINE NOT EVEN BUILT YET,ALREADY CREATED A JOB.
BUT HERE WE GO.
IT'S MARY LANDRIEU THAT'S GOTTHE MOST AT STAKE HERE, SO ASIDE
FROM THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHOARE ABOUT TO LIVE ON ENORMOUS
PIPELINE AVENUE, I'M SURE SHE'SGOT THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT.
LET'S LISTEN.
>> WE'VE BEEN BUILDING PIPELINESIN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE MOST OF
US WERE BORN.
ALL OF US WERE BORN.
THAT'S WHAT'S SO OUTRAGEOUSABOUT THIS DEBATE.
>> AND I SAY TO YOU TONIGHT MYFELLOW AMERICANS WE NEED TO
RETURN TO DOING THINGS THE WAYTHAT THEY WERE BEFORE WE WERE
ALL BORN.
LIKE SLAVERY.
BRING THAT BACK.
WHAT AM I EVEN DOING  STANDINGHERE VOTING LIKE I WAS A MAN OR
SOMETHING.
WE HAVE LAWS. OUR WAY.
RETURN TO HOW THINGS WERE WHENWE WERE NOT BORN.
[LAUGHTER]SO WE'VE ALWAYS BUILT PIPELINES,
WHY STOP NOW IS THE MOSTCONVINCING LINE OF REASONING.
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT?
>> WHAT PEOPLE IN LOUISIANAWANT, WHAT PEOPLE IN TEXAS WANT,
WHAT PEOPLE IN MISSISSIPPI WANT,WHAT PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY WANT,
WHAT PEOPLE IN SOUTH DAKOTA ANDILLINOIS AND KANSAS AND VERMONT,
ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU GOING TO NAMETHEM ALL?
ARE YOU GOING TO NAME ALL THESTATES?
BECAUSE ARE THERE STATES THATDON'T WANT GOOD PAYING JOBS?
[LAUGHTER]OF COURSE THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE
VALID  IN OREGON. THEY JUST BAGGROCERIES AND ENTER DATA
FOR THE RUSH.
ALRIGHT SO LANDRIEU'SLEGISLATIVE LIFE IS ON THE LINE.
BASES LOADED. BOTTOM OF THENINTH. AND THE PITCH.
>> THE BILL FAILED BY ONE VOTE.
>> Jon: SO CLOSE! IT'S LIKE MYDAD ALWAYS SAID YOU'RE JUST NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.
[LAUGHTER] YEAH.
SO THAT'S IT.
LANDRIEU'S ALMOST CERTAINLYGONE.
THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE'S BEENVOTED DOWN NEVER TO BE SEEN
AGAIN.
>> REPUBLICANS TAKE OVER THECONGRESS, THE SENATE IN JANUARY.
THEY WILL BRING THIS UP FIRSTORDER OF BUSINESS AND IT WILL
PASS.
>> Jon: AND WHEN IT DOESSOMEWHERE, EX-SENATOR MARY
LANDRIEU WILL BE THANKFUL THATEVEN THOUGH THE PIPELINE
DIDN'T SAVE HER JOB,SHE CAN NOW APPLY FOR ONE OF ITS
35 TO MILLIONS OF NEW ONES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
