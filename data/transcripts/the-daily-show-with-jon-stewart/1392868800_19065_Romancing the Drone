>> THE UNITED STATES HAS BEENCONDUCTING TARGETED KILLINGS
OUTSIDE OF BATTLEFIELDS FOR 10.5YEARS. KILLING SOMETHING LIKE3,500 PEOPLE
425 STRIKES, 375 UNDERPRESIDENT OBAMA.

OUTSIDE BATTLEFIELD SKY KILLINGOR BSK FOR THOSE OF YOU -- HE'S
LIKE BARRY BOMBS.
[LAUGHTER]
OF DRONE STRIKES, IF YOU WILL.
BUT THERE ARE LIMITS TO THISPRACTICE.
>> FOR THE RECORD, I DO NOTBELIEVE IT WOULD BE
CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THEGOVERNMENT TO TARGET AND KILL
ANY UNITED STATES CITIZEN WITH ADRONE OR WITH A SHOTGUN WITHOUT
DUE PROCESS.
>> Jon: WHAT A RELIEF.
[ LAUGHTER ]OF COURSE, THAT WAS IN MAY.
HOW DOES THAT STATEMENT HOLD UPIN FEBRUARY?
>> OFFICIALS CONFIRM THAT INDEEDTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS
TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER IT CANLEGALLY LAUNCH A DRONE STRIKE
AGAINST AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHOIS WORKING WITH AL QAEDA IN AN
UNNAMED FOREIGN COUNTRY.
>> Jon: THAT'S OUR DILEMMA.
IT'S NOT CONSTITUTIONAL TO KILL
AN AMERICAN WITHOUT DUE
PROCESS BUT THERE'S THISAMERICAN THAT WE WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO KILL.

PROCESS IS SUCH A PROCESS.

>> Jon: THANK YOU.
TORTURE, IT WASN'T A MORAL

BUT THEIR DECISION-MAKING NEVERWAS.
BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONWON'T SAY WE'RE NOT DOING A
TARGETED ASSASSINATION OF ANAMERICAN WITHOUT DUE PROCESS
WHEN THEY COULD SAY WE'RECONDUCTING AN AERIAL CITIZEN

THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES ABOVETHAT KIND OF SIMPLISTIC
