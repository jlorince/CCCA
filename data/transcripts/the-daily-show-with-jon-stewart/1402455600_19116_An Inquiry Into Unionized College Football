AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO WERESEEKING COMPENSATION FOR THE
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFITTHE NCAA HAD MADE OFF THEIR
LIKENESS AND VIDEO GAMES.
SO NOW THE NCAA ADVANCES IN THEBRACKET TO THEIR NEXT LAWSUIT.
BUT WHERE WILL IT END?
WITH FAIRLY COMPENSATINGATHLETES FOR THE UNGODLY AMOUNTS
OF MONEY THEY BRING INTO THENCAA?
I HOPE NOT.
THIS IS AMERICA.

OUR MEDICAL EXPENSES.

THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS WHEN THEY'VEBEEN INJURED.
WHAT ARE THESE KIDS GOING DO?

WE DON'T HAVE TIME GET A SECONDJOB.
>> OK, WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOUJUST SELL KAIN COLTER JERSEYS,
MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH.

DOCTOR INSTEAD OF MONEYWILL ACCEPT A NICE
LITTLE ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW FUNIT WAS TO BEAT WISCONSIN?

>> OH.
WELL, THAT'S ON YOU.
WHETHER IT'S COULTER AND OTHERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETES ONCE AGAIN
WHINING THAT THEY DESERVE A CUTOF NCAA PROFIT OR BRAND-NEW
COMPLAINTS ABOUT LOSING THEIRELIGIBILITY BECAUSE THEY PLAYED
PICK-UP FOOTBALL WHILE SERVINGIN THE MILITARY...
>> IT WAS JUST AN INTRAMURALLEAGUE, YOU KNOW, TO BUILD
CAMARADERIE BETWEEN TROOPS.
I DIDN'T FIGURE THEY WOULDPENALIZE ME FOR THAT.
BUT THEN COULTER DID SOMETHINGTRULY DESPICABLE.
>> NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY'SFOOTBALL TEAM IS ASKING TO BE
REPRESENTED BY A LABOR UNION.

COULTER IS ACTUALLY TRYING CLAIMTHAT HE'S AN EMPLOYEE OF THE
UNIVERSITY.

COMPENSATION OF ANY KIND WOULDDESTROY THIS BELOVED SPORT.

ROOM.
>> WELL, THAT'S UP TO THEM.
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO PLAYFOOTBALL, THEY CAN DO SOMETHING
ELSE.
THESE FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOULD BEPLAYING FOR THE LOVE OF THE
GAME.
>> EXACTLY.
TAKE A LESSON FROM THE NCAA ANDTHEIR SPONSORS WHO PUT ON THEIR
ANNUAL BOWL GAME SERIES FOR THELOVE OF THE -- WAIT.
WHO THE [BLEEPED] IS BEEF 'O'BRADY?
OK, MAYBE THE NCAA DOES MAKE $11BILLION A YEAR, BUT UNIONS ARE
NOT THE ANSWER.
SAYS THE NCAA.
>> USING A UNION EMPLOYEE MODELSTRIKES MOST PEOPLE AS GROSSLY
INAPPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THEPROBLEM.
>> AND THESE PLAYERS HAD NO IDEAHOW INAPPROPRIATE.

UNIONIZE?
DO THEY GET A MANDATORY SMOKEBREAK EVERY HOUR?
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY STRIKE?
UNIONS ARE OVERBEARING. THEY'REWORTHLESS.
THEY WANT TO CONTROL EVERYTHING.
THEY JUST TRY TO BE MONEYGRABBING LOSERS AND TRY TAKE THE
MONEY OUT OF HARD-WORKINGAMERICANS' POCKETS.

ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE THIS TOTHE COURT, FORCING CRITICS
LIKE BENKIE TO SEE THAT,OKAY, MAYBE THESE
PLAYERS SHOULD GET A SMALL,SMALL, TINY SLICE OF THE PIE.
>> THE NCAA, THEY HAVE A TON OFCASH.
THEY NEED TO BEEF UP THESCHOLARSHIPS.
I AGREE WITH THAT.
I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO.
>> THEY NEED TO BEEF UP THESCHOLARSHIPS A LITTLE BIT.
THEY JUST NEED SOME GROUP THATCOULD MAYBE COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN
ON THEIR BEHALF.
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT.
NO. KEEP THE UNIONS OUT OF IT.
>> KEEP THE UNIONS OUT OF IT.
NOW IS THE TIME TO SHOW COLTERWHAT UNIONIZED COLLEGE FOOTBALL
WOULD REALLY LOOK LIKE.
>> WHOA, YOU DON'T RUN ALL THEWAY.
YOU ARE 40 TO 30, YOU HAND ITOFF TO MY MAN HERE, HE'S 30 TO
20.

SMOKE BREAKS.
