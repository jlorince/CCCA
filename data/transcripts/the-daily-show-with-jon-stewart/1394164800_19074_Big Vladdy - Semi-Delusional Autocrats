NIGHT THAT AFTER SPEAKING TOPUTIN SHE DIDN'T THINK HE
WAS IN TOUCH WITH REALITYSAYING PUTIN WAS IN ANOTHER
WORLD.

HEADLINE.
MUCH OF THE WORLD NOW SEESPUTIN FOR WHAT HE IS, A SEMI
DELUSIONAL AUTOCRAT WHOVIEWS THE DISSOLUTION OF THE
SOVIET UNION AS ONE OF THEGREATEST TRAGEDIES OF THE
LATE 20TH CENTURY AND HASCONFUSED HIS OWNS GEO
POLITICAL PROPAGANDA FORREALITY.
WHO WOULD BE FOOLED BY THISGUY'S [BLEEP].
>> RUSSIA HAS A REAL LEADER.
AND OUR PRESIDENT JUSTIS-- IS INCAPABLE AND
UNWILLING TO LEAD.

AND HE DOES IT IN HALF ADAY.
HE MAKES A DECISION AND HEEXECUTES IT.
QUICKLY, THEN EVERYBODYREACTS THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL
A LEADER.
>> Jon: THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUCALL A LEADER.
MAKE THE QUICK DECISION ANDEVERYBODY REACTS?
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL ATODDLER.
(LAUGHTER)HONESTLY.
I GOT TO TELL YOU.
THE WEIRDEST THING ABOUTTHIS ISN'T PUTIN INVADING
UKRAINE.
YOU EXPECT A CRAZY GUY TOACT CRAZY.
THE WEIRDEST THING IS SEEINGCONSERVATIVES IN OUR COUNTRY
POINT AT THE CRAZY GUY ANDGO I'LL HAVE WHAT THEY'RE
HAVING.
PUTIN LIKES TO HANG OUT WITHHIS SHIRT OFF.
OBAMA WEARS MOM JEANS, PUTINTELLS THE WEST IF YOU MESS
WITH ME I WILL KILL YOU ALL.
>> PEOPLE ARE LOOKING ATPUTIN AS ONE WHO WRESTLES
BEARS AND DRILLS FOR OIL.
THEY LOOK AT OUR PRESIDENTAS ONE WHO WEARS MOM JEANS
AND EQUIVOCATES.
>> THIS IS A GUY THATWRESTLES TIGERS WHILE THE
PRESIDENT WEARS MOM PANTS.
>> Jon: WHAT A GREAT TALKINGPOINT THAT MOM JEANS TURNED
OUT TO BE.
HERE'S THE THING YOU GOT TOREMEMBER.
PUTIN DOESN'T ACTUALLYWRESTLE BEARS AND TIGERS.
THAT'S PROPAGANDA.
HE DID ONCE SHOOT A TIGER.
BUT ONLY AFTER THAT TIGERHAD BEEN PRETRANQUILIZED AND
TRAPPED IN A SNARE FOR HIM.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, HOW INONE 24 NEWS CYCLE DO YOU
UPGRADE PUTIN FROM WRESTLINGBEARS TO TIGERS ANYHOW, BYTOMORROW
IT WILL BE PUTIN ONCE SNAPPEDTHE TEETH OUT OF A GREAT WHITESHARK
AND MADE HIM BLOW HIM WHILEOBAMA SAT THERE WRISTFULLY
WEARING CAPRI PANTS AND ABABY BONNETT.
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THERE ISSOMETHING RIDICULOUS ABOUT A
MIDDLE-AGED WORLD LEADERRIDING AROUND SHIRTLESS ON A
HORSE LIKE CONAN THEBARBARIAN AFTER A DOZEN
DONUTS.
WHO THINKS THIS LOOKS GOOD?
>> IT'S LIKE THEY WANT OBAMATO SEEM WEAK TO THE RUSSIAN
PEOPLE.
THEY DON'T RESPECT WEAKNESS.
>> PUTIN, BIG, STRONG,MUSCULAR ON A HORSE.
>> Jon: BIG, STRONG,MUSCULAR ON A HORSE THAT IS
AN IMAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE ITSHOULD BE AIR BRUSHED ON TO
THE SIDE OF A VAN IN A NEWJERSEY REST AREA.
(LAUGHTER)I HAVE BEEN TO THAT REST
AREA.
IT'S NICE.
BUT FINE, YOU WANT OBAMA TOBE MORE LIKE PUTIN.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF OBAMADID ACT A BIT MORE
AUTHORITARIAN.
>> DID PRESIDENT OBAMA MISSTHE CLASS ABOUT THE THREE
EQUAL BRANCHES OFGOVERNMENT.
>> DOESN'T HE ACT MORE LIKEKING THAN PRESIDENT.
>> HE'S NOT THE KING.
>> EMPEROR OBAMA DOES WHATHE WANTS TO DO.
>> AN IMPERIAL PRESIDENTSHREDDING THE CONSTITUTION.
>> HE GUTTED THECONSTITUTION WITH OBAMA
CARE.
>> SHOVED DOWN THE THROATSOF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> THAT'S A FORM OF TYRANNY.
>> THOSE ARE THE ACTIONS OFA DICTATOR.
>> BARACK OBAMA NEEDS TO BEREMINDED HE IS NOT A
DICTATOR.
>> Jon: FASCINATING.
LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THISSTRAIGHT.
OBAMA IS A WEAK, MOM JEANSWEARING DICTATOR KING!
WEAK, WEAK MOM JEANS, TYRANTS,OF THE WORST TYRANTS OF ALL.
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITHTHESE PEOPLE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THESEPEOPLE AS CHILDREN.
THAT HAS ENABLED THISLOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH
AUTHORITARIAN FIGURES ANDTHE INHERENT COGNITIVE
DISSONANCE THAT GOESALONG WITH SUCH A SCHISM.
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKINGABOUT FOX CONTRIBUTOR RALPHPETERS
>> IT IS FUNNY, PUTINACTUALLY REMINDED ME IN A
PECULIAR WAY OF MY MOTHER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: GO ON.
>> MY MOTHER HAS A BRILLIANT,UNCANNY ABILITY TO MEET
SOMEONE AND WITHIN FIVEMINUTES SHE CAN IDENTIFY
THEIR WEAKNESS.
SHE KNOWS THEIR WEAK POINTS.
