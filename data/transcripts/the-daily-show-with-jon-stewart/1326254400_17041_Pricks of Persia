GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.
WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON THE UP
TO THE MINUTE MICROCHANGES OF
EARLY PRIMARY STATES.
I WONDER WHAT GOING IS ON IN THE
WORLD.
>> IRAN IS DEFYING THE REST OF
THE WORLD STARTING PRODUCTION AT
A SECOND URANIUM ENRICHMENT
SITE.
>> THIS URANIUM ENRICHMENT IS
TAKING PLACE AT A SITE CALLED
FORDO.
>> Jon: AH, FORDO NAMED FOR
THE FAMED HERO OF LORD OF THE
RINGS KNOCKOFF STREET VENDOR
TRILOGY.
WE WENT THERE.
A LIGHT FRIGHTENING.
>> IRAN IS SAYING, LOOK, IT'S
OKAY BEGUN EVERYBODY RELAX
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET
RADIO ISOTOPES BY ENRICHING THIS
URANIUM BECAUSE THERE ARE
800,000 CANCER PATIENTS WHO NEED
IT.
>> Jon: SORIC I THOUGHT YOU
WERE BUILDING A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS FOR
MEDICAL REASONS.
MAYBE YOUR PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE
SUCH A HIGH CANCER RATE IF YOU
DIDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TIME
ENRICHING URANIUM.
CAN A BROTHER GET A HAZMAT SUIT?
ARE YOU TOURING A NUCLEAR PLANT
OR FILLING MY XANAX PRESCRIPTION
AT RITE AID?
YOU'RE IN A -- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TO TAKE IRAN AT ITS WORLD
IT'S NOT A HOSTILE ACT TO ENRICH
IT WE'RE COOL.
>> THEY ARE THREATENING TO BLOCK
THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ.
>> A FIFTH OF THE WORL'S WATER
PASSES THROUGH THERE.
>> IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
WATERWAY ON THE PLANET.
>> Jon: I KNOW THE BERING
STRAIT IS RIGHT NOW LIKE OH, NO
YOU DIDN'T.
AND THE SUEZ CANAL IS WHAT LIKE
AM I CHOPPED LIVER?
PANAMA CALL NAL IS LIKE WHAT?
IF YOU LIKE THIS YOU'LL LOVE THE
CD COLLECTION STEWART
ANTHROPOMORPHIZES THE WORLD'S
WATER WAYS.
ERIE CANAL WHAT IS -- I'LL GIVE
YOU A MOMENT TO MAKE THE CALL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE WAS I?
ALL RIGHT THE GATHERING CLOUDS
OF WAR.
WHAT SUP IRAN?
I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO BE
COOL?
SEEMS LIKE THE PERSIAN GULF
MILITARY PRESENCE IS HOOKING YOU
UP SWEETLY.
>> THE U.S. COAST GUARD COMING
TO THE RESCUE OF AN AN RAYAN
SHIP IN THE GULF STRANDED.
>> Jon: THAT'S AFTER THE U.S.
RESCUING IRANIAN FISHERMEN FROM
SOMALI PIRATES.
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD
LIKE TO SAY TO US, IRAN?
>> IRAN SENTENCES AN AMERICAN TO
DEATH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: IS THERE SOMETHING
ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO
US?
>> IRAN CLAIMS HE WAS SENT BY
THE C.I.A. CONTINUE TO FILTRATE
THAT COUNTRY'S INTELLIGENCE AND
DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY.
HIS FAMILY SAID HE WAS VISITING
GRANDPARENTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: SPIES SPENT TO
DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY GOING TO
GRANDMAS.
I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS
HEADED.
TO HOLLYWOOD, THE SPY WHO LOVED
HIS BUBBY?
NO, OCTOGENARIAN?
NO THE HUNT FOR RED HEART CANDY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT SURE YOU DESERVE
ANOTHER -- ALL RIGHT FINE.
THREE DAYS IN THE CONDO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I SEE WE WASTED OUR AFTERNOON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IRAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHY ARE YOU POKING AT US?
YOU KNOW IRAN MEET ME AT CAMERA
THREE.
WHAT SUP, IRAN?
I KNOW IT'S FUN TO ANNOY US,
PULL ON THE GREAT SATAN'S BEARD.
YOU DO REALIZE THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO
WOULD LIKE TO BOMB YOU.
HAVE YOU PAID ATTENTION TO YOUR
REGION'S HISTORY IN THE PAST TEN
YEARS OR SO?
DO YOU WANT US TO BOMB YOU?
DID YOU LOOK AT IRAQ AND THINK,
HOW DO WE GET IN ON THAT SNAKS
WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY WORKING
ROADS AND EREKD BUILDINGS.
I HEAR THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE
IN THE RUBBLE BUSINESS.
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW
THIS BUT SINCE OUR MANUFACTURING
BASE DEPARTED IN THE 70s,
BOMBING (bleep) IN THE DESERT
IS KIND OF OUR THING NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES
OUR CHIEF EXPORT IS BOOMS!
AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
DOESN'T PLAY.
>> DO NOT DEVELOP A NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
THAT'S A RED LINE FOR US.
>> Jon: YOU DO NOT WANT TO
CROSS ONE OF OUR RED LINES.
WE LAY ONE RED LINE DOWN IT'S
UNCROSSABLE.
>> THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT
TOLERATE THE BLOCKING OF THE
STRAITS OF HORMUZ.
THAT'S ANOTHER RED LINE FOR US.
>> Jon: OKAY TWO.
YOU GET TWO RED LINES.
ONE MORE AND WE'LL DRAW A BLUE
CIRCLE AROUND YOU SO FAST.
I'LL GRANT YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT
GREAT WITH THE TOUGH TALK BUT HE
MIGHT NOT BE AROUND FOR MUCH
LONGER.
THERE'S AN ELECTION GOING ON
HERE.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT LIKE YOU, WE
DON'T KEEP THESE GUYS FOREVER.
AND THE GUYS WHO ARE LOOKING TO
TAKE OBAMA'S PLACE, THEY ARE NOT
ALL COOL BLACK GUYS WHO SMOKE
CIGARETTE AND DRAW LINES.
>> IRAN MUST NOT GET A NUCLEAR
WEAPON AND WE'LL GO ABOUT
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE
IT HAPPENS.
>> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
IS WILLING IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS
IF NECESSARY TO KEEP THEM FRYING
A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
>> WE COULD BREAK THE REGIME
WITHIN A YEAR.
>> I WOULD SEND TROOPS BACK INTO
IRAQ.
>> Jon: THAT'S HOW CRAZY THESE
(bleep) GUYS ARE.
THEY'LL BOOM BOMB YOU, THE
COUNTRY WE GOT OUT OF.
IF THERE'S AN IRA WE'RE BOMBING
IT.
WE DON'T CARE WHAT LETTER IT END
THES WITH!
THIS IS HOW MUCH THE NEW GUYS
HATE THE IDEA OF YOU DEVELOPING
NUKES.
>> THERE'S SCIENTISTS TURN UP
DEAD IN RUSSIA AND IRAN.
THERE'S BEEN COMPUTER VIRUSES,
PROBLEMS AT THEIR FACILITY.
THE HOPE THAT THE UNITED STATES
HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THAT.
>> Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT?
THAT IS A CANDIDATE FOR A MAJOR
POLITICAL PARTY EXPRESSING HIS
HOPE THAT WE'RE SECRETLY
MURDERING YOUR SCIENTISTS.
BY THE WAY, THAT DUDE SANTORUM
THAT IS WHAT WE CALL IN THIS
COUNTRY PROLIFE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE ONLY GUY WHOP -- WHO WON'T
BOMB YOU IS RON PAUL AND BELIEVE
THEY
ME THEY ARE GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING THEY CANNOT TO LET
THAT GUY WIN.
IRAN KEEP THIS US, I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF OBAMA HAS TO BOMB
YOU HIMSELF TO KEEP THESE OTHER
GUYS FROM CALLING HIM CHICKEN
(bleep).
AMERICANS DON'T HATE YOU AND I
HOPE IRANIANS DON'T WANT US BUT
IF YOU REALLY WANT A WAR
(bleep) WITH AMERICA DURING
ELECTION SEASON.
GET IN BETWEEN SEVEN POWERFUL
MEN AND HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE AN
OFFICER WITH NO CORNERS AND
POWER TO 24 HOURS A DAY PICK
YOU PHONE AND ANY (bleep) SAND
WIHCH THEY WANT.
THERE ISN'T
