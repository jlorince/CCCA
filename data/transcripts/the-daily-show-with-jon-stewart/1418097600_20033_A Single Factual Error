(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
NOW SOME OF YOU MAY HAVENOTICED LAST WEEK WE HAD
SORT OF AN IMPROMPTU THEMEWEEK FOCUSING ON SYSTEMIC
INJUSTICE.
AND ONE OF ITS PURPORTED SIDEEFFECTS, REMEMBER?
THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT,LIKE THE POLICE SHOOTING OF
TAMIR RICE IN CLEVELAND ORDANTE PARKER IN SAN BERNARDINO
COUNTY OR KENDRECMcDADE IN PASADENA OR
ARNAND BENNETT IN NEWORLEANS OR JOHN
CRAWFORD-- WHAT TIME DOESCOLBERT START? WHAT TIME DOES
HIS SHOW START?
(LAUGHTER)I'M SO DROLL.
NOW AS YOU SAW, ONE OF THESEEXAMPLES THAT WE USED OUT OF
MANY CAME FROM SANBERNARDINO COUNTY,
CALIFORNIA.
NOW THE DA THERE HAD SOMEISSUES WITH THIS JON STEWART
FELLER'S REPORT.
>> JON STEWART, HE TALKEDABOUT SHERIFF DEPUTIES
SHOOTING DANTE PARKER IN OURCOUNTY.
HE WAS SO WRONG ABOUT THOSEFACTS.
THEY DID NOT SHOOT HIM, THEYTASERED HIM, AFTER HE HAD
COMMITTED A BURGLARY AND HEWAS ATTEMPTING TO ASSAULT A
DEPUTY SHERIFF.
WE LATER FOUND THAT HE WASUNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MANY
TYPES OF DRUGS, WHICH WASTHE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH.
WE NEED TO GET OUR FACTSSTRAIGHT BEFORE WE START
MAKING STATEMENTS LIKE THAT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, TWOTHINGS.
ONE, WHY IS YOUR SET NICERTHAN MINE?
AND TWO,(LAUGHTER)
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RAMOS WASRIGHT.
WE WERE WRONG. IN OURLIST OF UNARMED BLACK MEN
SHOT BY POLICE, WE SHOULDNOT HAVE INCLUDED DANTE
PARKER WHO, ACCORDING TO THECOUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER,
DIED OF A PCP OVERDOSE.
SO I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
(LAUGHTER)I [BLEEP] HATE MAKING
UNFORCED ERRORS LIKE THIS.
I HATE IT I GET SO MAD ATMYSELF.
STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!
BECAUSE HERE'S MY GUESS. HERE ISWHY I SO HATE THIS. NOW RATHER
THAN HAVING TO HAVE THEUNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION
ABOUT A JUDICIAL SYSTEM THATMAY BE BIASED OR DISTURBING
PATTERN OF UNARMED BLACK MENBEING SHOT BY POLICE OR A
CERTAIN ELEMENT OFMILITARIZATION AND FORCE THAT'S
CREPT INTO SOME ASPECTS OFLAW ENFORCEMENT CULTURE, MY
STUPIDITY, MY SLOPPINESS, IDID THIS TO ME, CAN BECOME
AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGATETHAT ENTIRE CONVERSATION.
AND SHIFT IT BACK TOSLIGHTLY SAFER, LET'S SAY,
LESS NUANCED GROUND.
>> COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM,JON STEWART USES HIS SHOW TO
SLAM THE COPS.
>> Jon: SON OF A BITCH!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT.
AND I CAN'T EVEN FIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)AAHH!
AND I DESERVE THAT.
I DESERVE THAT.
THAT'S JUST WHAT I DID WITHTHE ONE FACTUAL ERROR THAT
IN NO WAY CHANGED THEPREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE OF
THE PIECE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOT NOONE TO BLAME BUT ME.
PLEASE, SIR, MAY I HAVEANOTHER?
>> OUT OF ALL THAT GLIBNESSAND SMUGNESS, DO THE FACTS
REALLY MATTER?
WELL, EVIDENTLY FOR JON STEWARTTHEY DON'T REALLY MATTER.
>> Jon: IT WAS ONE FACT!
YOU'RE BEING GLIB AND SMUGAND IGNORING ALL THE FACTS
RIGHT NOW!
BUT SEE THAT'S WHAT IS SOTOUGH ABOUT WORKING IN MEDIA
COUNTER ERRORISM.
(LAUGHTER)THE DAILY SHOW-- NO LISTEN
TO ME! HEAR ME OUT! THE DAILYSHOW
HAS TO BE RIGHT 100% OF THETIME.
FOX ONLY HAS TO BE RIGHTONCE.  BUT STILL, THIS IS
MY FAULT.
I DID IT TO ME.
I DID IT TO ME.
ALL THE STUFF COMING AT ME,I JUST GOT TO ACCEPT IT,
BRING IT ON.
>> IF YOU WANT TO FINE-TUNECOMMUNITY RELATIONS WITH
OFFICERS, FINE.
BUT NOW IT'S EVERYBODYFEASTING ON YOU GUYS.
JUST SO YOU KNOW, JUST TO PUTTHESE STATS IN CASE JON
STEWART WANTS TO INCLUDETHIS TONIGHT, 85 NYPD
OFFICERS WERE KILLED AFTER9/11.
>> Jon: [BLEEP] YOU.
SERIOUSLY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)[BLEEP] YOU.
THAT IS SO FAR OUT OF LINETHAT EVEN WITHIN THE
CONFINES OF THIS BIT,OSTENSIBLY ACCEPTING BLAME
FOR EVERYTHING THAT ISCOMING MY WAY FOR THE
FACTUAL ERROR I REALLY DOREGRET, [BLEEP] YOU.
EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT.
IN FACT, IF I HADN'T TOLDYOU TO [BLEEP] OFF I WOULD
HAVE HAD TO APOLOGIZE ONTOMORROW'S NIGHT'S SHOW FOR
BEING FACTUALLY INCORRECT.
BY THE WAY JACK ASS, YOU CANTRULY GRIEVE FOR EVERY
OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN LOST INTHE LINE OF DUTY IN THIS
COUNTRY AND STILL BETROUBLED BY CASES OF POLICE
OVERREACH.
THOSE TWO IDEAS ARE NOTMUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
YOU CAN HAVE GREAT REGARDFOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
STILL WANT THEM TO BE HELDTO HIGH STANDARDS.
BUT THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TOTOWN HERE
THIS ALL SOUNDS WAY WORSETHAN WHAT I THOUGHT I
ACTUALLY EVEN SAID ON THESHOW.
MAYBE I AM MISREMEMBERINGIT.
MAYBE-- CAN WE ROLL THE CLIPFROM MONDAY AGAIN?
>> I'M NOT SAYING ALL WENEED TO DO IS RE-EXAMINE A
SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES THESETYPES OF RESULTS, ALL I'M
SAYING IS COPS ARE EVIL.
EVERY ONE OF THEM.
AND WE MUST BURN THE COUNTRYTO THE GROUND.
ANARCHY, ANARCHY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: THE CAMERA REALLY
DOES ADD A CAPE AND AMUSTACHE.
(LAUGHTER)THE POINT IS THIS, RAISING
THESE ISSUES IS NOT THE SAMETHING AS DENIGRATING THE
POLICE.
IT'S A PLEA TO PUSH PAST THEDEFENSIVENESS AND TRY AND
GET TO THE REALITY TO MAKETHINGS BETTER, BUT MY
GUESS IS THAT AIN'T REALLYHAPPENING, IS IT?
>> HE TALKS ABOUT A BIGGERPICTURE.
THE BIGGER PICTURE FOR MEARE THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE
HONORABLE PROFESSION OF LAWENFORCEMENT, AND HOW THEY'RE
BEING ATTACKED IN THIS TIMEPERIOD IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
>> Jon: WELL, MR. DA,RESPECTFULLY, I THINK WE
DISAGREE.
I DON'T THINK SCRUTINY ISTHE SAME AS ATTACK.
AND WHILE I MAY DISAGREE WITHYOUR POINT OF VIEW, I
RESPECT THAT YOU DID GOTHROUGH THE TROUBLE OF
PROMOTING MY MOVIE WHILEMAKING IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
