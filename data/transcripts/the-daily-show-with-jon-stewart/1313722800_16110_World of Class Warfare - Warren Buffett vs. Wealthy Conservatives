>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: NO, NO!
I APPLAUD YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
OUR GUEST THE MULTITALENTED
ANNE HATHAWAY, VERY PLEASED
ABOUT THAT.
BUT FIRST, THERE IS AN
ONGOING ARGUMENT IN THIS
VERY COUNTRY, ABOUT HOW BEST
TO CLOSE THE ENORMOUS
DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE
INCURRED.
REPUBLICANS HAVE PROPOSED
DOING IT ENTIRELY THROUGH
SPENDING CUTS.
WHEREAS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
BRAVELY FOUGHT BACK
INSISTING WE DO IT ALMOST
ENTIRELY THROUGH SPENDING
CUTS.
WELL, THIS WEEK BIZARRELY
UNECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE
WARREN BUFF AT THE TIME
ENTERED THE FREY.
>> THE BILLIONAIRE SAYS
WHILE MOST AMERICANS
STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET,
WE MEGARICH CONTINUE TO GET
OUR EXTRAORDINARY TAX
BREAKS.
MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE BEEN
CODDLED LONG ENOUGH.
>> I PAY LOWER TAX RATE ON
MUCH OF MY INCOME THAN MY
CLEANING LADY DOES.
>> Jon: WELL, TO BE FAIR,
WARREN BUFFETT'S CLEANING
LADY IS ALSO A BILLIONAIRE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WARREN BUFFETT'S OP
ED WAS A THOUGHTFUL TREATISE
ON THE ADVANTAGES THE
SUPERWEALTHY CURRENTLY ENJOY
AT THE HANDS AT THE TAX
CODE.
OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
>> UP NEXT TONIGHT, WARREN
BUFFETT, CLASS WARFARE.
>> MORE CLASS WARFARE FROM
AN A FABL BILLIONAIRE WHO
SHOULD STOP ASSUMING THE
RICH ARE ALL BILLIONAIRES.
>> WARREN BUFFETT WROTE AN
OP ED, IS HE COMPLETELY A
SOCIALIST?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IS WARREN BUFFETT A
SOCIALIST?
YOU HAVE NO [BLEEP] CLUE
WHAT SOCIALIST IS, DO YOU.
HEY, THAT GEORGE CLOONEY
ALWAYS BANGING DIFFERENT
BROADS WHAT A YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)
-- WHAT A QUEER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SO CLOSING A FEW
CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES AND
RETURNING THE TOP MARGINAL
TAX RATE TO THE 90s ECONOMIC
BOOM TIME LEVELS IS CLASS
WARFARE.
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THE
RICH HAVE LEARNED, IT'S THAT
CLASS WARFARE IS HELL.
>> HE INVOKED THE CORPORATE
JET CLASS.
>> SO THAT'S A WHOLE NEW
CATEGORY OF PEOPLE TO
DEMONIZE, RIGHT.
>> SOAK THE RICH, IT'S THEIR
FAULT.
>> BARACK OBAMA'S TAX ON
THESE EVIL, DISGUSTING
CORPORATE JET OWNERS.
>> DEMONIZING THE RICH AS
EVIL, AS LAZY, AS INHERITERS
OF THEIR WEALTH.
>> HE'S SAYING FAT CATS.
>> IT'S DISAPPOINTING.
IT'S CLASS WARFARE AND THE
KIND OF LANGUAGE YOU WOULD
EXPECT FROM A LEADER OF A
THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY, NOT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
>> Jon: TRUE, BECAUSE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA IS NOT A
THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.
BY ANY MEASURE.
EXCEPT PERHAPS INCOME IN
EQUALITY WHERE WE RANK-- WORSE
THAN THE IVORY COAST, WORSE
THAN CAMEROON-- 64th.
AH.
IN YOUR FACE URUGUAY,
JAMAICA AND UGANDA.
(APPLAUSE)
UGANDA?
YEAH, UGANDA, YEAH.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: KEEP TRYING, RWANDA.
(LAUGHTER)
WOW.
AND BY THE WAY, NOT ONLY IS
CLOSING CORPORATE LOOPHOLES--
(LAUGHTER)
YOU ARE A NERD CROWD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THERE'S NO DOUBT IN
MY MIND.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY, NOT ONLY IS
CLOSING CORPORATE LOOPHOLES
AND RAISING THE MARGINAL TAX
RATE CLASS WARFARE, IT
TOTALLY WOULDN'T EVEN WORK.
>> YOU CAN TAX RICH PEOPLE
ALL YOU WANT.
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO --
>> THE IDEA THAT IF WE RAISE
TAXES AS THE PRESIDENT SAID
ON MILLIONAIRES AND
BILLIONAIRES, RAISE TAXES ON
OIL COMPANIES, RAISE TAXES
ON OWNERS OF PRIVATE JETS,
THAT THAT SOMEHOW IS GOING
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
RAISE THE TOP 2 INCOME TAX
RATES WHICH WOULD RAISE
ABOUT $700 BILLION OVER TEN
YEARS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ONLY A
TINY FRACTION OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT'S DEFICIT.
>> Jon: $700 BILLION OVER
TEN YEARS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S LESS MONEY THAN
WARREN BUFFETT'S CLEANING
LADY PULLS OUT OF HIS SHOWER
DRAIN EVERY WEEK.
(LAUGHTER)
