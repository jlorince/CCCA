>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
A LOT TO COVER.
WE'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT TO IT.
FIRST OF ALL, THE OLYMPICS, THE GAMES ENDED YESTERDAY.
HUGE SUCCESS THREE WAYS.
ONE, THE GAMES WERE EXCITING,
EMOTIONAL, COMPELLING AND VERY WELL EXECUTED BY THE HOST CITY.
NUMBER TWO, BRITAIN GOT TO DO WHAT EVERYONE HAS WANTED TO DO: DRIVE THE SPICE GIRLS OFF A
CLIFF THELMA AND LOUISE STYLE.
SLOW DOWN.
SHE'S JUST A BABY.
ROBERT PATTINSON IS OUR GUEST TONIGHT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN WHAT HE WILL SAY ABOUT THE OLYMPICS.
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING THIS SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME.
SO, LET ME ASSURE YOU,
MR. PATTINSON WILL COME OUT.
BUT YOU DO HAVE ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF VICE PRESIDENT SHALL JOKES TO PLOW THROUGH.
WE HAVE TO CATCH UP ON THE WEEKEND'S POLITICAL EVENTS.
THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW DEALING MOSTLY WITH POLITICS.
IN POLITICS, THERE WAS ONLY ONE STORY TO COVER THIS WEEKEND.
>> BREAKING NEWS.
MITT ROMNEY CHOOSES WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
>> Jon: WAIT.
WHAT?
THAT GUY NEXT TO ROMNEY IS NOT ALREADY A ROMNEY?
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S NOT LIKE RICK ROMNEY OR CHAD OR BUZZ ROMNEY?
APPARENTLY ROMNEY UNVEILED HIS VICE PRESIDENT SHALL CHOICE AT A RALLY ON SATURDAY MORNING ON ON
THE DECK OF THE BATTLESHIP U.S.S. WISCONSIN A SHIP ON WHICH BOTH MEN SERVED I'M SORRY A SHIP
WHERE THEY WERE SERVED REFRESHMENT.
>> PLEASE WELCOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
GOVERNOR MITT LOMB KNEE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: OKAY.
HERE I COME.
OH, BOY, GOLLY, THAT'S A LOT OF STAIRS.
OH, YES, OH, IS THAT ANOTHER ESCALATOR.
OKAY.
CAN I GET A ZIP LINE TO THIS
[BLEEP].
THE MAIN EVENT
>> JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
PAUL RYAN.
>> Jon: THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S FUNNY.
A LITTLE BIT OF A SMALL GAFFE.
OBAMA ACTUALLY DID THE SAME THING IN 200.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL UNLESS THE CROWD HAS A REALLY LONG TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW AWKWARD THE
MISTAKE IS WHILE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MAKES HIS WAY DOWN THE STAIRS
AND OVER THE MONKEY BARS, DOWN THE ROPE SWING.
DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE...
WOW.
LET ME SAY THIS.
A GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T PICK CHRIS CHRISTIE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
