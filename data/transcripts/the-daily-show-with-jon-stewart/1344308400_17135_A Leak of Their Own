[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAIL SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
IT'S A BIG ONE TONIGHT.
OUR OLD PAL TIM GUNN GOING TO BE JOINING US.
TIM GUNN'S GOING TO BE JOINING US.
I ASSUME FROM HIS NAME HE'S A HARDSCRABBLE PRIVATE DETECTIVE OR SOMETHING.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT OUR TOP STORY.
LISTEN, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HAD SOME NATIONAL SECURITY SUCCESS OVER SEAS, HELPING NATO TOP
QADDAFI, FINDING AND KILLING OSAMA BIN LADEN AND, OF COURSE,
THE LESSER-KNOWN FINDING AND KILLING OF WALDO.
ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY, GREAT NEW BOOK OUT,
"WHERE'S WALDO'S BODY." DON'T LOOK FOR WALDO.
REMEMBER.
HE'S DEAD.
LOOK FOR THE BODY BAG.
YOU CAN GO BACK LATER AND CHECK FOR IT.
BUT IT IS NOT OBAMA'S SECURITY SUCCESSES THAT HAVE HIS CRITICS
UPSET, BUT IT'S THAT WE KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THESE SUCCESSES.
THE ADMINISTRATION IS BEING ACCUSED OF ALLOWING DAMAGING SECURITY LEAKS TO BURNISH THEIR
OWN REPUTATION, AND THIS IS A PROBLEM.
>> THIS IS THE PROBLEM.
THESE LEAKS, ESPECIALLY THE KIND OF LEAKS THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED NOW BY NOT ONE BUT
TWO SPECIAL PROSECUTORS, THEY ARE TRULY INJURIOUS TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY.
THEY JEOPARDIZE OUR SECURITY AS A NATION.
THEY MAKE IT HARDER TO IMPLEMENT FOREIGN POLICY.
>> Jon: THEY ARE JEOPARDIZINGLY INJURIOUS.
LAUGHTER.
THANK YOU, JUDY MILLER, FORMERLY OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES."
LET'S SHOW HOW AN EXAMPLE OF THESE INJURIOUS LEAKS COULD BE USED IN A DAMAGING WAY.
LET'S USE AN EXAMPLE FROM, I DON'T KNOW, SEPTEMBER 8, 2002.
LET'S SAY SOMEBODY IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WANTS THE PUBLIC TO BELIEVE THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN
IS ACTIVELY RECONSTITUTING HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROGRAM.
WE'LL CALL THAT GUY VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY.
[LAUGHTER]
THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LEAK THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUCLEAR RECONSTITUTION TO A
HIGH-RANKING "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER.
LET'S CALL THAT PERSON, MMM,
JUDY MILLER.
[LAUGHTER]
JUDY MILLER WOULD THEN REPORT THAT INFORMATION IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
AT WHICH POINT THE VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY WOULD GO ON "MEET THE PRESS."
>> THERE'S A STORY IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THIS MORNING.
I WANT TO ATTRIBUTE THE "TIMES." "HE NOW IS TRYING THROUGH HIS
ILLICIT PROCUREMENT NETWORK TO ACQUIRE THE EQUIPMENT HE NEEDS TO ENRICH URANIUM."
>> Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT THIS
[BLEEPED] JUST DID.
YOU SEE WHAT THISSON OF A BITCH JUST DID.
THIS GUY WITH THE HUGE... THE STORY THAT CHENEY IS CITING ABOUT THIS RECONSTITUTED PROGRAM
IS THE ONE HIS ADMINISTRATION PLANTED THROUGH JUDY MILLER IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
AND NOW TO BRING THE WHOLE THING FULL CIRCLE SHE'S ON THE TV AS THE EXPERT ON WHY OTHER PEOPLE
DOING IT IS NOT GOOD WHEN IN REALITY THE MOVE SHE'S DESCRIBING SHOULD BE CALLED
"PULLING A MILLER." HEY, I GOT SOME DAMAGING NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION I
WANT TO GET OUT THERE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I GOT SOME NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION I WANT TO GET OUT
