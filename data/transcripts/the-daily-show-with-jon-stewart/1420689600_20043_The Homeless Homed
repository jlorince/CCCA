[ Applause ]>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK!
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU ONETHING, NOBODY LIKES
HOMELESSNESS. I'M VERYCONTROVERSIAL.
LEAST OF ALL THE HOMELESS.
BUT WHAT CAN BE DO DONE?
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH HAS APLAN THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.
HASAN MINHAJ REPORTS.
>> ACROSS AMERICA, NEW ANDINNOVATIVE WAYS TO ALLEVIATE
HOMELESSNESS ARE BEINGINTRODUCED, LIKE BANNING THE
HOMELESS BECAUSE OF BODY ODOR.
FINING THEM FOR SLEEPINGOUTDOORS.
AND ARRESTING THEM FORSITTING DOWN.
BUT SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH HASTAKEN THE NEXT STEP BY REMOVING
THE HOMELESS FROM THEIRSTREETS ALL TOGETHER.
SIR, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY HOMELESSPEOPLE?
>> NOPE.
>> HAVE YOU SEEN A SINGLE PERSONLIVING IN CARDBOARD BOX?
>> NO, SORRY.
>> WHERE THE HELL DID THEY PUTEVERYBODY?
TO FIND OUT I SAT DOWN WITH THEDIRECTOR OF THIS INITIATIVE
LLOYD PENDLETON.
>> WE HAVE REDUCED OURCHRONIC HOMELESS COUNT BY 72%
SINCE 2005.
>> DID YOU HIDE THEMUNDERGROUND?
>> WE DID NOT HIDE THE HOMELESSPEOPLE UNDERGROUND.
>> DID YOU CONVERT FROM MORMONTO GAY?
>> WE DID NOT CONVERT THEM FROMMORMON TO GAY OR GAY TO MORMON.
>> SO HOW DID THEY DO IT?
>> WE DID IT BY GIVING HOMES TOHOMELESS PEOPLE.
>> WHOSE -- YOU DID WHAT?
>> GAVE HOMES TO THE HOMELESS.
YES, IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU GIVE THEM HOUSING.
AND YOU END HOMELESSNESS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AS PART OF PROGRAM CALLEDHOUSING FIRST, SALT LAKE CITY IS
JUST GIVING APARTMENTS TO THEHOMELESS.
YOU GAVE A HOMELESS PERSON -->> A HOME.
>> OKAY, SO YOU GAVE A HOME TOTHE HOMELESS PERSON, BUT THAT
STILL MAKES THEM HOMELESS.
>> NO. THEY'RE HOUSED.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE HOMELESSYOU DO NOT HAVE A HOME.
THAT'S WHAT THE WORD MEANS.
>> I'M GOING TO BE HONESTWITH YOU, I SAW THE MOVIE
"INTERSTELLAR" AND THATMAKES MORE SENSE THAN
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
>> WELL YOU MAY THINK IT MAYNOT BE ADDING UP, BUT IT ADDS UP
TO US.
>> SURE.
GIVING HOMELESS PEOPLE HOMESSOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA, JUST
LIKE FEEDING PEOPLE ANDPROVIDING HEALTH CARE SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
BUT EVERYONE KNOWS WE JUST CAN'TAFFORD IT.
>> 22% OF AMERICANS ARECURRENTLY RECEIVING SOME KIND OF
GOVERNMENT ENTITLEMENT, THAT IS67 MILLION PEOPLE.
AND THE TRUTH IS, WE CAN'TAFFORD IT.
>> WHAT DO ALL OF THESE HANDOUTSCOST THE GOOD HARD WORKING
PEOPLE OF UTAH?
>> THESE HANDOUTS COSTS PROBABLY$12,000,
$10,000-$12,000 PER PERSONHOUSED.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> COMPARED WITH $20,000 A YEARON THE STREETS.
>> WAIT, WHAT?
>> WHAT WE GIVE THEM IS MOREEFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THAN THE
EMERGENCY SYSTEM, EMERGENCYROOM VISITS, EMT RUNS AND JAIL
TIME.
>> BUT, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUSTGIVING THEM A HOME.
>> YES.
>> OKAY, OKAY, SO IT MAKESFINANCIAL SENSE.
BUT THE FACT IS IT'S GOING TOMAKE THEM LAZY.
>> THEY DISINCENTIVIZE YOU TOGET OFF WELFARE.
>> RIGHT.>> ACTUALLY GO AND WORK.
>> I'LL GET MY RENT PAID, I'LLGET FOOD, WHY WOULD I WORK?
>> WHY WOULD I WORK WHEN THEGOVERNMENT PAYS ME NOT TO WORK?
WHY INDEED?
>> WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING ISINCENTIVIZING MOOCHING.
>> WE DON'T SEE THEM ASMOOCHERS.
WE SEE THEM AS PEOPLE IN GREATNEED OF SOME SUPPORT TO FULFILL
THEIR LIVES.
>> IT'S ALMOST ALMOST AS IFPENDLETON SEES THE POOR AND
HOMELESS AS ACTUAL PEOPLE.
THIS WAS GETTING COMPLICATED, SOI WENT TO VISIT ONE OF THESE
MOOCHERS AND THEIR MOOCHATORIUM.
>> THIS APARTMENT HAS GIVEN ME AJOB.
WITH THAT JOB I CAN MOVE BACK TOCHICAGO AND BE WITH MY SON, MY
DAUGHTER, AND MY FAMILY.
>> DO YOU SEE HOW THIS IS ASLIPPERY SLOPE?
DOESN'T IT SEEM THAT YOU'RETOTALLY DEPENDENT NOW ON FOUR
WALLS AND HAVING A ROOF OVERYOUR HEAD?
>> YES.
>> YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO WANT TOSLEEP ON CONCRETE EVER AGAIN.
>> WHY WOULD I WANT TO SLEEP ONCONCRETE?
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT WHEN IWAS OUT THERE.
>> BUT IF YOU JUST GIVE PEOPLETHESE APARTMENTS THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS GOING TOWANT TO BE POOR.
>> NO ONE WANTS TO BE POOR.
EVERYBODY NEEDS A HAND SOMETIME.
>> THIS WAS GETTING A BITCONFUSING.
IF YOU'RE A POOR PERSON YOU ARESUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THIS.
BUT THIS GUY HAS A JOB, ANAPARTMENT,
AND GENERAL SELF-ESTEEM.
>> THE IMAGE WE HAVE OF POORPEOPLE AS STARVING AND LIVING IN
SQUALOR REALLYIS NOT ACCURATE.
MANY HAVE THINGS, 99% OF THEMHAVE A REFRIGERATOR.
81% HAVE A MICROWAVE.
78% HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.
>> WHAT?
SO THEY'RE EATING FOOD THAT'SBEEN CHILLED?
AND THEN HEATED?
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKEUS.
RUSSELL, THEY GAVE YOU A PANINIPRESS?
>> I THINK I BOUGHT THAT.
>> NOW I'M TOTALLY LOST.
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM A HOME.
HE'S GOTTEN HIS LIFE BACKTOGETHER, HE'S BECOME A
PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY.
AND IT'S COSTING US LESS?
>> SO, WHAT'S THE CATCH?
>> WHAT IS THE CATCH>
>> YES, THERE HAS TO BE A CATCH.
IS THIS LIKE A HOMELESS TIMESHARES.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ATIME SHARE FEE EVERY YEAR,
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
IT WORKS.
>> SO IF YOU SEE A HOMELESSPERSON DON'T FEEL BAD.
KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET A SECONDSHOT AT LIFE.
ALL THEY HAVE TO DOIS LIVE IN UTAH.
