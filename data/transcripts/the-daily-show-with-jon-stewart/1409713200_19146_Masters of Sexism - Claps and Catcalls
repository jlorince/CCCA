FOR MORE WE GO TO JESSICAWILLIAMS LIVE TONIGHT OUTSIDETHE
SENATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT IS YOUR... YOU'RE A WOMAN.
JESSICA.
WHAT IS YOUR... WHAT IS YOURTAKE ON ALL OF THIS?
YOU'RE CLAPPING, I GET IT, THATGUY WAS CLAPPING, SO NOW YOU'RE
CLAPPING.
>> OH, NO, JON, YOU KNOW, THISIS JUST HOW WE WOMEN SHOW OUR
APPRECIATION FOR THE MALEGAZE, AND IF YOU MAY OFFER
MY OWN UNSOLICITED COMMENTS TOTHAT GUY, THOUGH SMILES
DO NOT INDICATE A90% SUCCESS RATE.
>> Jon: THEY DON'T?
BUT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DOTHE SMILES MEAN?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, IT MEANSTHAT THE WOMAN IS TRYING HER
BEST TO END THIS INTERACTION,BECAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T SMILE, HE
MIGHT TELL HER TO SMILE.
IF SHE TELLS YOU TO LEAVE HERALONE, YOU'LL PROBABLY CALL HER
A BITCH. AND I KNOW HE THINKSHE'S DIFFERENT, THAT HE'S
CLASSY, HE'S CHARMING,BUT SINCE GOING TO WORK
ISN'T A PERFORMANCE, WE'RE NOTLOOKING FOR APPLAUSE, AND WHAT
HE'S DOING IS BASICALLY JUST AHIGH-MINDED LINCOLN CENTER
VERSION OF HEY, SWEET TITS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I SEE YOU SEEM TO HAVE
STRUCK A NERVE WITH OURAUDIENCE.
>> MMM.
>> Jon: WELL, ON BEHALF OF MYGENDER, I, I AM, I AM SO SORRY.
>> OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, I'VEACTUALLY HEARD A LOT WORSE.
ONE TIME THIS GUY WITH AHAIRLESS CAT STANDING ON THE

>> Jon: DON'T FINISH THIS, DON'TFINISH THIS BECAUSE I KNOW
WHERE THAT'S GOING.
>> OK, DEAL. DEAL, DEAL. THAT'SFINE, BUT MY POINT IS, THIS
TELLY SAVALAS-LOOKINGMOTHER [BLEEPED], AND YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT, I KNOW WHO TELLYSAVALAS IS. HE'S KOJAK, RIGHT?
CAUSE MY GRANDMA, MY GRANDMAUSED TO WATCH IT AND SHE WOULD
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT. I GUESSHE WAS LIKE A SEXY GUY,
LIKE AN NYPD OFFICER. HE HAD ATOOTHPICK.
>> Jon: HE WAS VERY SEXY. THAT'SRIGHT.
>> HE WAS BALD.>> Jon: YES.
>> OKAY.
WHATEVER. ANYWAY,
THAT TELLY SAVALAS-LOOKINGMOTHER [BLEEPED] SHOULD HOLD HIS
APPLAUSE BECAUSE OUR WALK TOWORK IS NOT THERE FOR HIM TO
COMMENT ON.
IT'S NOT A RED CARPET.
IT'S NOT A FASHION WEEKRUNWAY.
IT'S A SIDEWALK.
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, GETTINGTHE HORNY CLAP OF APPROVAL FROM
ANY GUY DOES NOT IMPROVE MY DAY.
IT ACTUALLY CREEPS ME OUT.
SO GUYS, GET SOME IMPULSECONTROL.
CAUSE I'VE GOT SOME [BLEEPED] TODO.
>> Jon: ALRIGHT. JESSICAWILLIAMS, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
