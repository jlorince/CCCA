NOW, THANK YOU.
BESIDES ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING IN THE FIRST ACT, THE COUNTRY IS ALSO FACING
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IMMIGRATION ISSUES.
HOW REALISTIC ARE THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS?
JASON JONES FILED THIS REPORT.
>> ARIZONA'S NEW IMMIGRATION LAW REQUIRES POLICE TO QUESTION
ANYONE THEY REASONABLY SUSPECT OF BEING AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.
BUT HOW EXACTLY DO YOU SPOT ILLEGALS?
I WENT OUT ON MAY 5th TO FIND OUT.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU THINK CONSTITUTES REASONABLE SUSPICION?
>> REASONABLE SUSPICION I WOULD SAY IS THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
>> IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF THIS, A LITTLE BIT OF CORONA.
>> PERCEPTION.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU PERCEIVE AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TO LOOK LIKE?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> MAYBE THEY'D BE WEARING SOMBREROS OR DRINKING OR EATING SPICY FOOD OR SPEAKING BROKEN ENGLISH.
>> DRINKING.
>> OH, MY GOD, SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR WAS EVERYWHERE.
BUT HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DETERMINING WHO IS ILLEGAL.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, HOMBRE?
>> RICH.
>> RICH?
>> YEAH.
>> SURE IT IS.
>> IT IS.
>> HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
>> I WALKED.
>> YOU WALKED ALL THE WAY HERE?
>> YEAH, FROM MY WORK.
>> WHAT, PICKING STRAWBERRIES?
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
>> GRABBED A CAB FROM PENN STATION.
>> SO A FOREIGNER SMUGGLED YOU IN THE BACK OF HIS CAR ALL THE WAY HERE?
>> A FOREIGNER?
NO, I TOOK A CAB FROM PENN STATION.
>> OF COURSE, ESTABLISHING REASONABLE SUSPICION IS JUST THE FIRST STEP.
I'M GOING TO NEED TO SEE YOUR PAPERS.
>> I DON'T HAVE MY WALLET ON ME.
>> I'M FROM THE UNITED STATES.
>> OH, REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> MOVE IT.
>> HOW DO I PROVE IT.
>> WHICH AMENDMENT PROTECTS CITIZENS FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES?
>> SEVEN.
>> CHECK THIS OUT.
GUYS, GUYS, UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURES, WHAT AMENDMENT?
>> QUATRO.
>> THAT'S A BUNCH OF JOHNNY AMERICANS IN THERE.
IF OUR POLITICIANS DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT THEY DID IN ARIZONA, THEN OUR STREETS
WILL BE OVERRUN BY LAZINESS AND LOUD ETHNIC MUSIC.
♪ ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ♪♪
HOWEVER, WE MUST TREAD CAREFULLY BECAUSE ILLEGALS ARE ON A HAIR TRIGGER.
ANYTHING CAN SET THEM OFF.
>> YOU'RE AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.
>> ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME.
I WENT TO COLLEGE.
WHAT THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.
[BLEEP] YOU, MAN.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, THE TRUE FACE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
>> [BLEEP]
>> IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A LINE YOU CAN'T CROSS.
AS AN ILLEGAL, DO YOU FEEL YOUR RIGHTS ARE BEING INFRINGED UPON.
♪ ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ♪♪
>> SADLY, IF ILLEGALS CONTINUE TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AT WILL,
THE AMERICAN VALUES WE HOLD SO DEAR WILL BE DESTROYED.
>> HEY, LOOK AT MY TWO NEW MEXICAN WIVES.
TIME TO KISS THE BRIDES.
CINCO DE MAYO!
>> BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON IS...
♪ ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ♪♪||||
