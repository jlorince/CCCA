>> WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW!
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER!
I'M STILL HERE.
JON STEWART HAS BEEN
SPENDING HIS SUMMER IN THE
MIDDLE EAST DIRECTING A
MOVIE THAT HE WROTE.
THAT IMAGE IS NOT PHOTO SHOP
THAT IS A REAL PICTURE.
I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT I LEVEL WITH ALL OF
YOU.
I HAVE BEEN LYING ABOUT
WHERE JON STEWART'S BEEN ALL
SUMMER.
IN FACT, I'VE LIED TO YOU
EXACTLY 31 TIMES IT SEEMED
APPROPRIATE TO CONFESS
TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS MY
LAST SHOW AT INTERIM HOST.
STOP HIDING YOUR JOY.
JON STEWART WILL BE BACK IN
SEPTEMBER.
WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO
SEEING HIM SO MUCH.
BEFORE WE GO INTO OUR TOP
STORY TONIGHT WE JUST WANTED
TO TAKE A MOMENT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THE HORRIFYING
EVENTS UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW
IN EGYPT.
OUR DEEPEST THOUGHTS ARE
WITH EVERYONE OVER THERE FOR
MORE ON THAT DEVELOPING
STORY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
WATCH THE REAL NEWS.
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THEY'RE
BUILT FOR.
IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GOING
TO PUSH AHEAD WITH OUR FINAL
SILLY SHOW OF THE SUMMER,
OUR GUEST TONIGHT WRITER AND
OF THE SILLY SHOW SIMON PEG
WILL BE WITH US.
FRANKLY, SIMON HAS A LOT TO
LIVE UP TO TONIGHT GUEST
WISEMENT I DON'T KNOW IF HE
SAW LAST NIGHT'S SHOW BUT
REGIS PHIL PYNN ENDED THE
INTERVIEW IN A SLIGHTLY
UNEXPECTED MANNER.
♪ LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT ♪
♪ HE KISSED ME ON THE HEAD.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOKE UP
THIS MORNING AND HI A GRAY
PATCH OF HAIR IN THE EXACT
SHAPE OF REGIS'S LIPS.
AND I REALIZED HE JUST SAPD
MY YOUTH.
THAT'S HOW HE STILL LOOKS SO
INCREDIBLE.
HE SUCKS YEARS FROM THE
HEADS OF MEN THROUGH HIS
LIPS.
HE TOOK TEN YEARS FROM MY
LIFE.
AND I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING
T WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!
EVERYTHING FELT BETTER IN
THAT MOMENT.
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A FUN
SUMMER SO MANY MEMORIES.
TRADITIONALLY THIS CAN BE A
SLOW TIME FOR NEWS BUT THIS
PARTICULAR SUMMER HAS BEEN
JUST ONE STORY AFTER
ANOTHER.
WE HAD THE VOTING RIGHTS
ACT.
GAY MARRIAGE.
PAULA DEEN.
WE DID IMMIGRATION.
THERE WAS A ROYAL BABY WITH
JASON JONES PUNCHING A HORSE
IN THE FACE.
WE HAD A MID SHOW BLACKOUT
FORCING ME TO INTERVIEW ERIC
IN THE DARK.
THEN THERE WAS, OF COURSE,
THAT NIGHT THE DARK PUNK
PLAYED LIVE IN OUR STUDIO
INSTEAD OF GOING ON COLBERT.
THAT WAS FUN.
THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS
THAT AMAZING MOMENT WHERE
HELEN MIRIN WAS A GUEST AND
SHE DECIDED TO SLIP AND
SLIDE OVER TO THE DESK.
