>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE LOVE,WE LOVE THIS WOMAN,
MELISSA McCARTHY IS GOING TO BEJOINING US TONIGHT.
WE'RE SO PLEASED ABOUT THAT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]BUT FIRST, IT'S A FUNNY STORY,
REMEMBER THAT TIME WEINVADED IRAQ TO REMOVE THE
THREAT OF THE WORLD'S MOSTDANGEROUS PEOPLE USING THE
WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONSAND IT TURNED OUT THE THREAT
WASN'T THERE? WELL, GOODNEWS, THE THREAT'S THERE NOW.
[LAUGHTER]IN SOME MEASURE DUE TO THE
DESTABILIZING EFFECT OF OURINTERVENTION.
AND, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THEPEOPLE WHO HYPED THE ORIGINAL
PLAN WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW.
>> WE MUST GRAPPLE WITH HOW BESTTO HELP IRAQ MEET THIS THREAT.
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIALTHAT WE STOP ISIS FROM GAINING
THIS FOOTHOLD IN IRAQ.
>> WE NEED AIR POWER IMMEDIATELYTO STOP THE ADVANCE.
>> WE HAVE TO ACT.
WE MUST ACT.
>> Jon: WE MUST.
[LAUGHTER]ACT.
WELL, IF WE DO, I THINK YOU'REGOING TO NEED ACTING LESSONS.
LOOK. BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TOYOU AND YOUR FRIENDS STARRING IN
A NEW PLAY CALLED "A STREETCARNAMED WE'RE ALWAYS WRONG."
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN UP.
HERE'S HOW WE DO IT -- BY THEWAY, IRAQ ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE
THAT THESE GUYS WANT THE PLAY TOOPEN.
>> I SUPPORT PUTTING PEOPLE INAFRICA.
THAT'S WHERE THIS WAR IS HEADED.
>> CHAD HAS BEEN SCREAMING FORHELP FROM THE UNITED STATES.
>> IN LIBYA WE CAN HAVE AINFLUENCE.
>> HELPING THE RESISTANCE INSYRIA.
>> WHATEVER THE KURDS NEED WESHOULD PROVIDE THEM.
>> HELP ARM THE UKRAINIANPEOPLE.
>> Jon: THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTEFOR AMERICAN MILITARY
ASSISTANCE.
IN FACT, IN A BLIND WEAPONSTEST, NINE OUT OF TEN CLIENT
STATES PREFER WEAPONS FROM THEUNITED STATES TO THOSE FROM I
CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT AMERICA.
YES, THERE IS APPARENTLY NOCOUNTRY REPUBLICANS WILL NOT PUT
UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THEUNITED STATES.
EXCEPT ONE.
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS TODAYDEFEATED A $60 BILLION PLAN FOR
INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS.
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKING ABILL THAT WOULD RENEW EXPIRED
TAX BREAKS.
>> BLOCKED A $21 BILLIONVETERANS BILL.
>> BLOCKED AN INCREASE IN THEMINIMUM WAGE.
>> BLOCKED THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESSACT.
>> BLOCK UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
>> NO IS WHAT THE AMERICANPEOPLE WANT.
>> WE'RE THE PARTY OF HELL NO.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: WELL, I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE ATERRIBLE PARTY.
I MEAN, WITH WILL THERE BEDANCING AND PIZZA?
>> HELL NO.
>> Jon: OH! I GOT AN IDEA.
I GOT AN IDEA.
HOW ABOUT NOT MAKING IT HARDERFOR PEOPLE TO GET FOOD STAMPS.
>> HELL NO.
>> Jon: OKAY.
DO YOU DO ANYTHING BUT COMPLAINBITTERLY ANYMORE?
>> HELL NO.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: IF YOU'RE A DOODIE
HEAD, SAY "HELL NO."
>> HELL NO.[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NOW, BUT SERIOUSLY, THEYMUST HAVE... THE REPUBLICANS
MUST HAVE GOOD REASONS FORBLOCKING EVERY DOMESTIC BILL
THAT COMES ACROSS THEIR DESKS.
>> WE CANNOT AFFORD IT.
WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.
>> AMERICA'S GOING BROKE.
>> THE GOVERNMENT IS BROKE.
>> YOU CAN'T KEEP SPENDING MOREMONEY THAN YOU HAVE.
>> Jon: WE'RE SPENDING MONEYWILLY-NILLY.
AND DID YOU KNOW WE'RE SAVING UPTO GET A MORE PATRIOTIC
AMERICAN STATUE OF LIBERTY.
BA-BAM!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL KINDS OFREASONS WHY REPUBLICANS BELIEVE
DOMESTIC SPENDING IS FOLLY.
>> BIG GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK.
>> MASSIVE GOVERNMENT SPENDING,PARTICULARLY DEBT SPENDING, IS
NOT THE SOLUTION.
>> LAST THING WE WANT DO IS ADDTO THE DEBT AND DEFICIT.
>> THE NEGATIVE UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCES OF OUR GOODINTENTIONS.
>> RAMPANT WASTE, FRAUD ANDABUSE.
>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OURPROGRAMS ENCOURAGE WORK, NOT
DEPENDENCE.
>> OUR POLICY CANNOT BE TOSIMPLY RELEGATE MORE AND MORE OF
OUR CITIZENS TO DEPENDENCEON THE GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: BY THE WAY, DOES OUT OFCONTROL GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAVE
THE SAME CORRUPTING EFFECT ONNON-AMERICANS.
>> AMERICA'S GOAL IN IRAQ WAS TOHELP THE IRAQI PEOPLE TO
BUILD A DEMOCRATIC NATION THATCAN GOVERN ITSELF.
>> CREATE REAL DEMOCRACY FORPEOPLE WHO WANT IT.
>> WE HELP AFGHANS BEGIN TOBUILD A NEW DEMOCRACY, BUILD
THEIR ECONOMY AND PROVIDE BASICSERVICE AND EXPAND HEALTH CARE
AS WELL AS OPEN UP SCHOOLS.
>> AND ALLOWING FOR FREEDOM TOSPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Jon: SO BASICALLY WHEN WEGIVE OTHER COUNTRIES GOVERNMENT
ASSISTANCE, THEY HANDLE ITGREAT.
BUT WHEN WE GET IT OURSELVES, WE[BLEEPED] IT ALL UP.
[LAUGHTER]WHY IS IT YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE
ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES,WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE AND
CULTURE DEPENDENCY WHEN IT COMESTO THE UNLIMITED CHECKBOOK WE
HAVE FOR FOREIGNMILITARY ADVENTURES?
>> OF COURSE THE WAR HAS BEENCOSTLY, BUT WE'VE BEEN PROTECTED
FROM ATTACK HERE AT HOME.
>> Jon: BULL [BLEEPED].
PUTTING ASIDE THE QUESTIONABLECONTENTION THAT THE WARS IN IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN HAVE KEPT USSAFE HERE AT HOME, YOU DO KNOW
TERRORISM ISN'T THE ONLY THINGAMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO BE
PROTECTED FROM.
>> THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVILENGINEERS GIVES AMERICA'S
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AD-PLUS.
>> THE V.A. SAYS AT LEAST 23PEOPLE HAVE DIED WAITING FOR
CARE.
>> 50 MILLION AMERICANS LIVINGBELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.
>> TEMPERATURES COULD GO UP BY 9DEGREES THIS CENTURY, AND SEA
LEVELS COULD RISE AN EXTRA 10 TO21 INCHES.
>> 30 AMERICANS DIE FROM GUNVIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
>> Jon: NONE OF IT ISTERRORISM, RIGHT?
BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE DOSOMETHING ABOUT IT.
IF THERE WAS ONE MAN WHOEMBODIED THE ETHOS OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THIS REGARD,I'D HAVE TO SAY, IT'S OUR OLD
FRIEND JEFF SESSIONS OF ALABAMA.NEVER MET A WAR APPROPRIATIONS
BILL HE DIDN'T LIKE. HAPPY TOSPEND THE MONEY OVERSEAS.
>> WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO OURTROOPS, AND THEY'RE PREPARED TO
PUT THEIR LIVES AT STAKE FOR US.
AND, I DON'T THINK THEY OUGHT TOBE THE SLIGHTEST SUGGESTION IN
ANY WAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TOHONOR THAT COMMITMENT.
>> WHO DO I MAKE THE CHECK OUTTO, SIR?
AND OF COURSE, HE'S NOT TOOWORRIED ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO
WORK OUT.
>> SO YOU HAVE FAITH THAT THECOST OF THIS WAR IN CASUALTIES
AND THE COST OF LIKE HALF ATRILLION DOLLARS OF RISKS IN
TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE IN THEWORLD NOT LIKING WHAT WE'RE
DOING WHICH IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS ISALL WORTH IT BECAUSE IF WE DO
FAIL, THINGS FAIL, AND WE COMEHOME OR WE COME HOME AND AFTER
WE COME HOME, IT FAILS OVERTHERE, THEY GO BACK TO
SOME MILITARY COUP.
ISN'T THAT DANGER THAT WE CAN'TCHANGE THE COURSE OF A COUNTRY
IF WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE THEREA LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME?
>> WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'SGOING TO HAPPEN.
>> Jon: OH, HE DOESN'T BELIEVEIT!
WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]UNLIMITED MONEY TO GO OVER
THERE.
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING BAD'SGOING TO HAPPEN.
WELL, HOW ABOUT SPENDING SOMEMONEY ON CLEANING UP THE MESS
YOU MADE HERE AT HOME FOR THEVETERANS.
>> WE NEED TO RESIST THETEMPTATION TO CREATE MORE
ENTITLEMENTS AND MOREENTITLEMENTS, WHICH IS ONE OF
THE REASONS THAT WE'RE HEADINGRECKLESSLY TO A FISCAL CRISIS.
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULDCREATE A BLANK CHECK, AN
UNLIMITED ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMNOW.
>> Jon: GO [BLEEPED] YOURSELF.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M WORRIED.
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THEREPUBLICANS.
THEIR INABILITY TO WEANTHEMSELVES OFF OF MILITARY
INTERVENTION.
THEY HAVE A CULTURE OFDEFENDANCY, IF YOU, WILL AND I
BELIEVE IT'S TURNED THEM ALLINTO WARFARE QUEENS.
AND, I THINK WE NEED TO CUT THEMOFF FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
