[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WE'RE BACK WITH
GOVERNOR PERRY.
IN YOUR MIND WHEN DID WASHINGTON
GOOD OFF THE RAILS?
>> A-A CENTURY AGO ACTUALLY
LITERALLY.
>> Jon: SERIOUSLY?
>> WILSON AND THE PROGRESSIVE
MOVEMENT STARTED THE 16th
AMENDMENT.
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN
WASHINGTON GOT OFF THE TRACK IS
THE 16th AMENDMENT GIVING THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE YOUR
MONEY WITH THE INCOME TAX.
THAT'S THE REASON CLIFF LEE IS
STAYING IN TEXAS.
YOU THEY THAT?
>> Jon: HE DOESN'T REALIZE
YOU'RE A YANKEE HERE.
>> OW!
>> Jon: THERE ARE VERY FEW
PEOPLE THAT WOULD GOOD TO BOOK A
A PRE1920 UNITED STATES.
>> SURE.
>> Jon: THAT MOVEMENT DIDN'T
ARISE OUT OF NOTHING.
CHILDREN WORKED IN STPABGTRYS.
WOMEN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE.
THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT THERE
THAT --
>> I GET THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
SKWROFRPLGTS YOU MAY GET IT BUT
THAT AIN'T RIGHT!
>> THE FACT IS THEN YOU HAD THE
GREAT DEPRESSION.
AGAIN GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AFTER
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT LOOKING
BACK ON IT NOW DIDN'T WORK.
YOU GO INTO -- BIG GOVERNMENT
HAS REALLY NOT HELPED THIS
COUNTRY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF
ECONOMICALLY.
COMPETENT STEUGS HOW WE --
COMPETITION IS HOW WE BECOME
STRONG.
>> Jon: YOU SAID TO ME TEXAS
HAS GIRLFRIEND A NUMBER -- HAS
GAINED 153 --
>> 153 BUSINESSES HAVE MOVED OUT
OF CALIFORNIA TO TEXAS SINCE THE
FIRST OF THE YEAR THROUGH
AUGUST.
850,000 JOBS WERE CREATED IN THE
TEXAS IN THE DECADE OF 2000.
FOUR OUT OF FIVE PRIVATE SECTOR
JOBS NOW CREATED IN TEXAS.
>> Jon: WHY?
>> BECAUSE WE LET PEOPLE KEEP
MORE OF THEIR MONEY.
WE HAVE A TAX STRUCTURE THAT IS
FAIR AND PREDICABLE.
A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T
ALLOW FOR OVERSUING AND AN
ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
>> Jon: COULDN'T YOU MAKE THE
SAME ARGUMENT FOR COMPANIES
GOING TO INDIA AND CHINA.
IF YOU ARE THE PRESSURE VALVE
RELEASE FOR COMPANIES IN
CALIFORNIA WOULD YOU CRITICIZE
TEXAS COMPANIES --
>> DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN INDIA
OR TEXAS?
>> Jon: FOR REAL?
[LAUGHTER]
I REAM -- REALLY LIKE WHERE I
LIVE NOW BUT THANK THANK YOU.
WHAT I'M WONDERING IS THIS.
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PROGRESSIVE
INCOME TAX THAT WILSON DID BUT
THE FACT OF CONGRESS BEING ABLE
TO LEVY TAXES WAS THE
CONSTITUTION.
WE HAD THE ARTICLES OF THE
CONFEDDATION.
YOU MIGHT BE MORE COMFORTABLE
WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE
ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.
>> I WOULD LIKE WASHINGTON TO DO
THEIR BASIC RESPONSIBILITY LIKE
SECURE THE BORDER WITH MEXICO.
I HAD FIVE CITIZENS KILLED LAST
WEEK.
I'VE ASKED TWO ADMINISTRATIONS
TO BUT PUT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND
TO SECURE THAT BORDER.
THAT SAY BASE RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU LOOK OVER IN ARTICLE 4 OF
THE CONSTITUTION IT'S TO PROTECT
AND DEFEND IT.
THEY ARE NOT DOING IT.
I'VE ASKED THIS SECRETARY OF
HOMELAND SECURITY AND BASICALLY
GOT THE ANSWER OF LISTEN, PERRY,
IF YOU WANT NATIONAL GUARD
TROOPS ON THE BORDER SEND THEM
YOURSELF AND PAY FOR THEM.
>> Jon: SHE DIDN'T EVEN SAY
MISTER OR GOVERNOR.
LISTEN TO ME MR. P.
>> I GET THAT A LOT.
>> Jon: WE'LL TAKE A
COMMERCIAL.
DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES?
>> YES
