I'M PARAPHRASING.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ANYWAY SO THAT GOES DOWN.
AND THEN CAME THIS CLIP UNEARTHED BY A CONSERVATIVE WEB SITE.
>> I THINK YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT,
JON.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY CORRECT.
I WOULD SAY I'M MORE OF A SOCIALISM OR INDEPENDENT.
OH, MY GOD!
I LOOK GREAT.
WOW!
DHAWZ.
WOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST REALIZED THAT INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED JUST MOMENTS -- MOMENTS BEFORE
LARRY KING DRAINED ME OF MY YOUTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHEN I THINK I MEANT BY THE COMMENT ON THAT SHOW SEEING I HAVE AT
VARIOUS TIMES DESCRIBED MYSELF AS SOCIALIST, INDEPENDENT, WIG,
ROCKEFELLER INDEPENDENT P TEDDY ROOSEVELT DEMOCRAT AND (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T BELIEVE IN STATE CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL OR COLLECTIZING -- COLLECTIVIZING FARMS BUT I
BELIEVE THERE'S VALUE IN POLICIES THAT DERIVE FROM A MORE SOCIALIST ETHOS.
>> I THINK SOCIAL SECURITY IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM.
>> Jon: LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY.
THANK YOU COURAGEOUS COMRADE.
I BELIEVE IN THAT A SOCIALIZED PROGRAM TO EASE POFERLY AMONG THE ELDERLY THAT WE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO.
WHAT ELSE WOULD BE SOCIALIST?
>> MEDICARE WILL SAVE THE SAFETY NET OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT
OUR ESTEEMED ELDERS IN COUNTRY NEED.
>> Jon: SEE YOU AT THE MEETING, SISTER SARA.
I USED THE TERM SOCIALISM IN THE YEAR 2000 BEFORE OBAMA RUINED IT FOR EVERYBODY.
>> BARACK OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
>> HE'S OBVIOUSLY A SOCIALIST.
>> HIS SOCIALIST POLICIES ARE BANKRUPTING AMERICA.
>> HIS SOCIALIST POLICIES ARE RUINING AMERICA.
>> Jon: YES, SOCIALISM IS A NEW S WORD.
THE WORSE THING YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE.
IT'S LIKE IF THE C WORD AND THE N WORD HAD A BABY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT BABY'S NAME:  OBAMA.
>> OBAMA CARE IS QUITE CLEARLY THE CROWN JEWEL OF SOCIALISM.
>> OBAMA CARE IS THE FLAGSHIP OF SOCIALISM.
IT'S PURE UNADULT RATED SOCIALISM.
>> Jon: UNCUT, GOT STUFF.
[ LAUGHTER ]
APPARENTLY SOCIALISM IS LIKE CHOLESTEROL SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE THE GOOD KIND.
OBAMA CARE IS THE BAD KIND,
UNADULT RATED SOCIALISM, A PROGRAM WHERE EVERYONE WILL BE FORGED TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE
IN A COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE OF PRIVATE PROFIT INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE MARXIST DREAM.
