COMEDY CENTRAL
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JON--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH,
TONIGHT'S PROGRAM SAY GOOD
ONE, MY GUEST MINDY KALING,
TRIPLE THREAT!
WRITER, PRODUCER, STAR.
SHE'S VERY SUCCESSFUL.
ALTHOUGH SHE WAS VERY
SUCCESSFUL WHEN SHE WAS JUST
ON ITS OFFICE.
SHE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR A
VERY LONG TIME.
I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO-- LET'S GET TO OUR
TOP STORY TONIGHT.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, AS
THOUGH WE HAVE A TOP STORY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR
CHRIS CHRISTIE, IS LOSING
WEIGHT.
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE ANNOUNCING
THAT AFTER STRUGGLING WITH
OBESITY FOR YEARS HE
REVEALED HE SECRETLY HAD LAP
BAND STOMACH SURGERY.
>> SOME SAY IT IS A SIGN
WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN
2016.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OF COURSE SOME SAY
THAT.
SOME SAY THAT HE'S RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT, IT'S A SURE
SIGN.
BECAUSE WHY ELSE WOULD A
50-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH YOUNG
CHILDREN AND A LOVING FAMILY
TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS
OBESITY AND EXTEND HIS LIFE.
WHY ELSE?
IT IS A CLASSIC PRESIDENTIAL
RUN TELL.
(LAUGHTER)
GOES BACK TO THE DAYS OF
EISENHOWER WHEN EVERYBODY
KNEW HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE
A PRESIDENT.
OF COURSE THE PHYSICAL
TRANSFORMATION THAT
EISENHOWER UNDERWENT FORCED
HIM TO CHANGE HIS ORIGINAL
CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CAN'T A GUY GET HEALTHY
WITHOUT PROGNOSTICATORS?
>> OH WHAT DOES IT MEAN.
IT MEANS HE DOESN'T FEEL
WELL!
AND WANTS TO FEEL BETTER.
BUT YOU KNOW, YOUNG CHRISTIE,
IF YOU DO WISH TO BECOME
PRESIDENT, IT WILL TAKE MORE
THAN TRIMMING DOWN AN
OCCASIONAL BOUGHTS OF
REASONABLENESS.
TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF YOU
MUST HAVE THE REFLEXES OF A
NINJA.
>> NICE!
>> Jon: NOW, WHERE WERE WE?
(APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY NOW THAT
JOB WOULD BE HANDLED BY
DRONES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH, I'M
MAKING THAT UP, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE
PRESIDENT, CHRISTIE.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
NO, DID HE-- NO, COULD IT
BE-- IT BE?
>> A GROUP OF SCHOOLCHILDREN
WAS VISITING IF YOU JERSEY
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE WHEN
THE SPIDER CRAWLED ON HIS
DESK.
HE QUICKLY SQUASHED THE
PROBLEM.
>> Jon: ONLY IT WASN'T AN
ODE SPIDER.
IT WAS THE FAMOUS
DR. ARACHNO, WHO WAS AT THAT
MOMENT RUSHING TO CHRISTIE'S
OFFICE TO TELL HIM OF THE
CAN SUR-- CANCER CURE
BREAKTHROUGH THAT HE HAD
DISCOVERED.
(LAUGHTER)
SADLY, I GUESS BECAUSE OF
CHRIS CHRISTIE, KWAN
CERTIFICATE-- CANCER WILL
ALWAYS BE WITH US.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
HONESTLY, I DON'T-- I DON'T
KNOW THAT THAT WAS
DR. ARACHNO.
JUST KIDDING.
OR THAT HE WAS WORKING, AND
WHY WOULD HE WORK ON HUMAN
CANCER.
HE WOULD BE WORK ON SPIDER
CANCER, I WITHOUT THINK, AT
THE TIME.
REALLY THE WHOLE THING IS
SOMEWHAT FARFETCHED.
THE POINT IS THIS BY THE WAY,
IF YOU WERE CONCERNED AT ALL
THAT GOVERNOR CHRIS YEAUX
SET A POOR EXAMPLE FOR THE
CHILDREN WHO WERE VISITING
HIS OFFICE, OR WOULD RUN
AFOUL OF PETA, PLEASE KNOW
THAT THE GOVERNOR SAVED THAT
SPIDER FROM A FAR WORSE
FAITH.
>>
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YUP.
HEY, THEY BRING A SPIDER,
YOU BRING A STAPLER.
