(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
VERY KIND.
WE HAVE A GREAT MONDAY NIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
JOINT CHIEF OF STAFFS ADMIRAL
MIKE MULLEN WILL BE JOINING US
LATER.
IT'S OUR THIRD TIME TALKING TO
HIM WHICH I BELIEVE MAKES ME A
SERGEANT.
(LAUGHING)
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
OBVIOUSLY THE BIG STORY FROM
THIS WEEKEND.
OBVIOUSLY WHAT EVERYONE WAS
TALKING AND THINKING ABOUT:
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S JOBS BILL.
A BILL SO IMPORTANT THAT ITS
UNVEILING LAST THURSDAY NIGHT
PREEMPTED THE PACKERS'-SAINTS
GAME PRE-GAME THROUGH.
TWO TEAMS WITH HIGH
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE COMING
SEASON.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
JOBS BILL.
WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS
THAT IT PREEMPTED MY PRE-GAME
SHOW?
>> IT WILL CREATE MORE JOBS
FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, MORE
JOBS FOR TEACHERS, MORE JOBS
FOR VETERANS AND MORE JOBS FOR
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED.
REPAIR AND MODERNIZE AT LEAST
35,000 SCHOOLS.
IT WILL PROVIDE A TAX BREAK
FOR COMPANIES WHO HIRE NEW
WORKERS AND CUT PAYROLL TAXES
IN HALF FOR EVERY WORKING
AMERICAN AND EVERY SMALL
BUSINESS.
>> Jon: IT WILL TRIPLE
GUARANTEE THAT ALL CHILDREN
GET TO BE THE THING THEY
WANTED TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP,
INCLUDING ASTRONAUTS,
BALLERINA, LION-TAMER, AND
MOST OF ALL BATMAN.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THEY
CAN BECOME MR. PRESIDENT.
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS PLAN?
THAT DOES SO MUCH FOR SO MANY?
>> IT'S CALLED THE AMERICAN
JOBS ACT.
>> Jon: THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?
THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT?
WAS EMPLOYMENT IDEAS
T.B.D.ALREADY TAKEN?
COME ON, EVEN YOUR CRAPPY
BILLS HAVE ASPIRATIONAL
QUALITIES TO THEM.
THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND
REINVESTMENT ACT.
WE DIDN'T AND IT WASN'T.
BUT IT WAS TRYING.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BUSH ERA
ORWELLIAN OPPOSITE DAY
NOMENCLATURE.
ALLOWING COMPANIES TO
INCINERATE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND
CALL IT THE CLEAR SKIES ACT.
GIVE US SOME SPIN.
A LITTLE HUMOR.
A LITTLE ZING.
THE AMERICANS TAKE THIS JOB
AND LOVE IT ACT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE MAKE IT RAIN ACT.
THE REMEMBER ME, I (BEEP) BIN
LADEN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 2001.
GIVE US SOMETHING.
BRANDING ISSUES ASIDE, OBAMA
WAS ON A TEAR THURSDAY NIGHT.
>> WHAT I WILL NOT DO IS LET
THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS BE USED
AS AN EXCUSE TO WIPE OUT THE
BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT
AMERICANS HAVE COUNTED ON FOR
DECADES.
THIS ISN'T CLASS WARFARE.
THIS IS SIMPLE MATH.
THIS LARGER NOTION THAT THE
ONLY THING WE CAN DO TO
RESTORE PROSPERITY IS JUST
DISMANTLE GOVERNMENT, REFUND
EVERYBODY'S MONEY AND LET
EVERYONE WRITE THEIR OWN RULES
AND TELL EVERYONE THEY'RE ON
THEIR OWN, THAT'S NOT WHO WE
ARE.
>> Jon: FELT PRETTY GOOD.
DIDN'T IT?
WAS THAT SO HARD,
MR. PRESIDENT?
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS
WHOLE "HIT 'EM WHERE IT HURTS"
THING BEFORE THE COUNTRY SLID
INTO AN UNSTOPPABLE (BEEP)
SPIRAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE MOST?
(LAUGHING) YOU KNOW WHAT I
LOVE MOST ABOUT THAT SPEECH TO
THE CONGRESSIONAL JOINT
SESSION, THE AWESOME CUT-AWAYS
TO UNCOMFORTABLE REPUBLICANS.
LOOK AT THOSE FACES.
IT IS A VERITABLE SPECTRUM OF
POORLY CONCEALED DISCOMFORT.
EVERY SHADE OF DISCOMFORT
REPRESENTED.
ERIC CANTOR LOOKS LIKE HE'S
THINKING, "MAYBE I DON'T MOVE,
THE T-REX WON'T SEE ME."
RAND PAUL TRYING NOT TO LOOK
DISGUSTED LIKE IF HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS SHOWING OFF
BELLY DANCE LESSONS AS A
FRIEND'S CONFIRMATION.
MITCH McCONNELL LOOKS STUNNED
AND FAT LIKE A GUY WHO JUST
SAW A DOG WITH WHEELS INSTEAD
OF BACK LEGS ROLL BY.
AND JOHN McCAIN HAS THE LOOK
OF A MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA THE
PLAY HE WAS WATCHING WOULD
FEATURE SO MUCH FULL FRONTAL
MALE NUDITY.
PUPPETRY OF THE PENIS.
I THOUGHT THE FOCUS WOULD BE
ON THE PUPPETRY.
