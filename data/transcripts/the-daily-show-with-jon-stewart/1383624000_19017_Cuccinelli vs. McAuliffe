LEADERS. AND IN TOMORROW'S GOVERNOR'S RACE SHE COULD GIVE
BIRTH TO ANOTHER.
REPUBLICAN KEN CUCINELLI ORDEMOCRAT TERRY McAULIFFE.

>> FOR VIRGINIANS IT'S A CHOICEBETWEEN A FAR RIGHT WING TEA
PARTY SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE AND ADEMOCRAT WHO HAS BEEN GUILTY OF
SLEAZY BUSINESS DEALS ANDQUESTIONABLE FUNDRAISING..
>> Reporter: PROFESSORWE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE.
HOW BAD COULD THEY ACTUALLY BE?
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN UNFAVORABLERATINGS THIS HIGH FOR BOTH
OF THE MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES.
LESS THAN 30% OF VIRGINIANS HAVELESA FAVORABLE VIEW OF EITHERAVE
CANDIDATE.
IF THEY WERE THAT BAD I HAD TOSEE IT FOR MYSELF, SO I HEADED
TO THEIR FINAL DEBATE. >> THEY ARE TRYING TO OUTLAW
COMMON FORMS OF CONTRACEPTIONAND WANT TO MAKE THE PILL
ILLEGAL.
>> TERRY SAID YOU HELP ME, IHELP YOU.
IT'S POLITICS.
>> Reporter: THEY SEEM LIKEYOUR RUN OF THE MILL JERKOFF
POLITICIANS.
>> TWO (bleep).
[LAUGHTER]>>  MAYBE I JUST WASN'T PAYING
CLOSE ENOUGH ATTENTION.
THIS SEEMED FAMILIAR.
THE CUCH IS A TYPICAL TEAPARTYER AND TEFLON TERRY MIXES
POLITICS AND MONEY.
POL>> WITH CUCCINELLI THERE'SSOMETHING CALLED GIFT
GATE WHERE HE ACCEPTED MONEY.
>> YOU MEAN McAULIFFE.
>> THIS IS CUCINELLI. CUCCINELLIDOES THE EXACT SAME THING?
>> ANYTHING ELSE.
>> McAULIFFE HE WAS TAKING HISWIFE AND NEWBORN SON BACK FROM
THE HOSPITAL TO HOME BUT HESTOPPED AT A DEMOCRATIC FUND
RAISER FOR AN HOUR WHILE THEWIFE AND NEWBORN STAYED IN THE
CAR.
>> WHAT?
PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
>> YES, HE BRAGGED ABOUT IT INHIS OWN BOOK.
>> SORRY, I JUST VOMITED IN MYMOUTH.
WAIT THERE'S MORE.
>> TERRY McAULIFFE IS A WALKINGNEGATIVE AD.
>> KEN CUCCINELLI IS OUT THERE.
>> HOMOPHOBIC AND ANTI-CHOICE.
>> THERE'S A QUESTION OF PRIVATEJETS AND VACATION HOMES.
>> THIS WILL IS NOT -->> HOLY (bleep) THIS IS A
NIGHTMARE.
EVEN MAJOR NEWSPAPERS AREENBORISSING NONE OF THE --
ENDORSING NONE OF THE ABOVE ANDGUY WHO IS NOT EVEN RUNNING.
>> YOU SEE WHY SO MANYVIRGINIANS ARE FLUMMOXED.
FLUMMOXED?
IS THAT A SOUTHERN TERM THAT MEANS THE SAME AS
(bleep)?
>> I HAD ONE VOTER TELL ME ITWAS A CHOICE BETWEEN A HEART
ATTACK AND CANCER.
>> TOMORROW VIRGINIANS WILLENTER A POLLING STATION AND
ACTUALLY HAVE TO PICK A HEART ATTACK OR CANCER TO
BE THE GOVERNOR.
WHAT INVOLUNTARY LOOKS OFHORRIBLE DISGUST RUN ACROSS EACH
VOTERS FACE WHEN MAKING THISDECISION. TO FIND OUT
WE MADE TWO DRINKS A TERRYMcAULIFFE, A GREASY MIX OF BEAT
JUICE, VINEGAR, ANCHOVIES, ANDCOMMERCIAL WASTE, AND THE
KEN CUCINELLI, A HAZARDOUSCOMBINATION OF IRISH CREAM,
VINEGAR, LIME JUICE, AND ANENTIRE BOTTLE OF WINDEX.
WE TOOK OUR SAMPLES TO THESTREETS.
FIRST UP THE CUCINELLI.
LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN IN SLOWMOTION.
HOW ABOUT THE McAULIFFE.
DID YOU JUST VOMIT RIGHTTHERE?
>> JUST A LITTLE.
>> NO ONE WAS PREPARED TO MAKETHE CHOICE.
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU RATHER DRINKFOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS?
>> THEY ARE BOTH HORRIBLE.
I LOVE VIRGINIA BUT I DON'T KNOWWHAT PART OF VIRGINIA THIS
REPRESENTS.
PERHAPS WE WE HAVE TO FIND MORESUITABLE STAND-INS FOR PEOPLE
TO INGEST. BECAUSE NO CREDIBLECHOICES RAN IN YOUR STATE.
THE POLLS SAY 36% OF LIKELYVOTERS WILL CHOOSE POND SCUM
WHILE 43% ARE SUPPORTINGDOG
POOP.
WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THECURRENT STATE OF POLITICS.
IT WAS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABESWHERE TRUE WISDOM CAME.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANYPEOPLE EAT DOG POOP.
>> CRAZY WORLD WE LIVE IN?
>> YES, IT IS.
>>YES IT IS, SON. YES IT IS.
