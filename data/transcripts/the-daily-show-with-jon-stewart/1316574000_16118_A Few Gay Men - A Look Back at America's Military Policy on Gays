(LAUGHTER)
THE END OF THE POLICY OF "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL," OF COURSE, DID
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK
BACK AT EXACTLY HOW FAR THE
MILITARY HAD COME ON THE ISSUE
OF GAY SOLDIERS.
>> IT BEGINS IN 1950 WHEN
PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN SIGNS
INTO LAW THE UNIFORM CODE OF
MILITARY JUSTICE MAKING SODOMY
ITSELF A CRIME.
>> Jon: OH, YES!
HARRY TRUMAN'S FAMOUS POLICY OF
THE (BLEEP) STOPPED HERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> YEARS LATER UNDER PRESIDENT
RONALD REAGAN THE PENTAGON
ISSUES A DIRECTIVE STATING THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY IS INCOMPATIBLE
WITH MILITARY SERVICE.
>> Jon: SO THE MILITARY NEEDS
DISCIPLINED WELL-GROOMED
INDIVIDUALS COMFORTABLE IN
CRISPLY PRESSED COLORFUL
UNIFORMS.
NO PLACE FOR GAYS!
(LAUGHTER)
TELL 'EM, BOYS.
♪ THE PEOPLE RIDE IN A HOLE IN
THE GROUND, NEW YORK, NEW
YORK... ♪
>> Jon: GO OUT THERE AND ENJOY
SOME VAGINA.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE WAS
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL."
>> IN 1993, A COMPROMISE
EMERGES.
>> THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
HAVE AGREED TO REMOVE THE
QUESTION REGARDING ONE'S SEXUAL
ORIENTATION FROM FUTURE VERSIONS
OF THE ENLISTMENT APPLICATION.
AND IT WILL NOT BE ASKED IN THE
INTERIM.
>> Jon: (AS BILL CLINTON)
I MEAN, IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS
WHERE YOU'RE STICKING IT, RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE, YOU
KNOW?
>> JON.
>> Jon: (AS B.C.)
JON?
>> EMMY?
>> Jon: DID SUNDAY NIGHT MEAN
NOTHING TO YOU?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT WAS A WONDERFUL EVENING, IT
MEANT A LOT TO ME.
>> HERE WE ARE NOT 48 HOURS LATE
WE ARE A REHEATED CLINTON JOKE
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STALE
LEFTOVER IN 2000.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY HAVE TO
SUBMIT ONE EPISODE SO IT'S NOT
LIKE...
>> I SHOULD HAVE SLEPT WITH
COLBERT WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I BEAT YOU TO THAT, TOO,
HUH?
>> YOU MONSTER!
>> Jon: OF COURSE THE REAL
CONCERN WITH REPEALING "DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL" WAS HOW IT
WOULD ENCOURAGE IMMORALITY AND
INDECENCY AND NOT A DAY AFTER
ITS REPEAL WE ALREADY SEE THE
TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT NOW FEEL
FREE TO FLAUNT THEIR LIFE-STYLE.
>> ONE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN
POST-ING ANONYMOUS VIDEOS ABOUT
HIS EXPERIENCE UNDER "DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL" CALLED HIS FATHER
JUST HOURS AFTER THE REPEAL.
>> HELLO?
>> HEY, DADDY.
>> HEY, BUD!
>> CAN I TELL YOUING?
>> YEAH.
>> WILL YOU LOVE ME REGARDLESS?
>> YES.
>> YOU'LL ALWAYS LOVE ME?
AS LONG AS I'M...
>> OF COURSE.
>> DAD, I'M GAY.
>> I STILL LOVE YOU AND I WILL
ALWAYS LOVE YOU.
I WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD OF YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS, DAD.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WHAT KIND OF MONSTERS--
(LAUGHTER)
-- HAVE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE?
AND HOW DO I GET MY DAD TO
