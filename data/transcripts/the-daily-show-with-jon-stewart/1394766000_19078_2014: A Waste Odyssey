LET'S TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD.
PERHAPS YOU ARE MERELY AWATCHDOG FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND LIKE WATCH DOGS YOU DOOCCASIONALLY BARK AT BURGLARS
BUT MOSTLY JUST THE DISHWASHERAND SHADOWS.
FOR INSTANCE,, WHAT IS THEWASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE IN THE
FOOD STAMP PROGRAM?
>> MORE THAN $3 BILLION HAS BEENLOST TO TRAFFICKING.
FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS EACHYEAR.
>> Jon: THAT AIN'T NOTHING.THAT IS A LOT AND I IMAGINE
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT $3BILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY.
>> YOU AND I KNOW NUMBERS.
I KNOW YOU KNOW NUMBERS.
I ASSUME YOU KNOW I KNOWNUMBERS.
>> Jon: OKAY, FINE.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO KNOWING NUMBERS AND HATING
WASTE AND FRAUD AS YOU DO.
WHEN DEMOCRATS WERE LOOKING TORAISE $1 TRILLION IN REVENUE IN
PART BY ENDING THE WASTEFUL $4BILLION IN TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES
THAT GO TO ALREADY PROFITABLEOIL COMPANIES YOU SAID WHAT?
>> THE TAX BREAKS OR LOOPHOLESOR TAX CREDITS YOU GIVE TO OIL
COMPANIES AMOUNT TO $4 BILLION AYEAR.
THEIR A PITTANCE COMPARED TOWHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: OH, $4 BILLION IS A
PITTANCE, A PITTANCE FOR THEREFRIGERATOR SET.
[ LAUGHTER ]SO WHAT I HAVE LEARNED TODAY
FROM MY TEACHER IS THAT $3BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY IS
GREATER THAN $4 BILLION INTAXPAYER MONEY.
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.
I THINK WE'RE DONE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]YOU ARE THE WORST MATH TEACHER I
EVER HAD SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVETO DO THE BIT ANYMORE.
BUT (bleep) IT WE'RE GONNA KEEPDOING THE BIT. LET'S KEEP GOING.
IS $3 BILLION GREATER THAN THIS?
>> THE UNITED STATESLOSES AN ESTIMATED
$150 BILLION ANNUALLY TO TAXAVOIDANCE SCHEMES INVOLVING TAX
HAVENS.
>> A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE ONLYPAYING HALF THE CURRENT TAX RATE
FOR CORPORATIONS AND SOME AREN'TPAYING ANY INCOME TAXES AT ALL.
>> SOME COMPANIES HAD SO MANYTAX BREAKS THEIR TAX BURDEN WENT
NEGATIVE MEANING THEY GOT MONEYBACK.
>> Jon: WHICH THEY USED TOHIRE LOBBYISTS TO CREATE MORE
TAX LOOPHOLES AND IT'S THECIRCLE OF LIFE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]IF SURFER GUY IS A PARASITE
AND A RAT AND I CAN'T IMAGINEWHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT
CORPORATIONS THAT TAKE FULLADVANTAGE OF OUR TAX LAWS AND
AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. I GOTMY MONEY ON LEECH VULTURES.
>> WHETHER THEY NEED IT OR NOTIT WAS AVAILABLE SO THEY WENTAND GOT IT.
WHY DO WE VILIFY? WHY DO WE LOOKFOR THESE COMPANIES?
THEY TOOK CHEAP MONEY.
>> I PAY ALL THE TAXESTHAT ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED NOT A
DOLLAR MORE.
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT SOMEONEAS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO
PAYS MORE TAXES THAN HE OWES.
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEMONIZESUCCESS.
EVERY ONE OF US WALKS INTO H ANDR BLOCK IN APRIL AND TAKES EVERY
DEDUCTION AVAILABLE US TO.
IF THEY ARE DOING IT LEGALLYWHAT IS WRONG WITH IT?
THAT IS WRONG WITH THEGOVERNMENT THAT SET UP THE TAX
CODE THAT IS SO CONVOLUTED ANDTHEY WROTE IN THOSE LOOPHOLES.
>> IT'S COMPLETELY LEGAL, ANDGOOD FOR THEM.
>> Jon: JUST TO BE CLEAR SO ON(bleep) MOUNTAIN THIS
(bleep)'S NARCISSISMREPRESENTS ALL
THE AMERICANS WHOARE IMPOVERISHED AND NEED FOOD
ASSISTANCE BUT THESE (bleep)'SNARCISSISM
REPRESENTS ALL THAT IS GOOD ANDDECENT ABOUT AMERICA. WHY THE
DISTINCTION?
>> AS THE RICH GET RICHER, ITFLOATS ALL BOATS.
>> LET OUR JOB CREATORS KEEPMORE OF WHAT WE EARN AND
PRODUCE SO WE CAN HIRE MOREPEOPLE AND THAT WILL GET THE
ECONOMY ROLLING ALONG.
>> WE SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHING THEJOB CREATORS.
>> EMPLOY MILLIONS OFAMERICANS. WHY GO AFTER THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE JOB CREATORS.
>> Jon: JUST BECAUSE THEYOCCASIONALLY ALSO DESTROY THE
ECONOMY.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT AT LEAST HALF THE TIME THEY
ARE CREATING JOBS.
IF ONLY THERE WAS ONE STORY THATCOULD EXEMPLIFY THE CORPORATE
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE JOBCREATION NEXUS.
>> JP MORGAN CHASE PROVIDES FOODSTAMP DEBIT CARDS IN 26 STATES
AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
THE FIRM IS PAID PER CUSTOMERAND IN THE STATE OF INDIANA JP
MORGAN MAKES ROUGHLY $186,000PER MONTH.
>> Jon: WHOA IN FACT IT'SKIND OF GENIUS.
SINCE 2004 18 OF THE 24 STATESJP MORGAN HANDLES HAVE BEEN
CONTRACTED TO PAY THECOMPANY OVER $560 MILLION.
IT'S A BRILLIANT BUSINESS MODEL.
YOU MAKE A TON OF MONEY SELLINGSUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND
DERIVATIVES AND THEN WHEN THATBUSINESS CRASHES THE ECONOMY AND
MILLIONS OF HOMEOWNERS FINDTHEMSELVES UNDERWATER AND
FORECLOSED UPON AND HAVE TO GOON FOOD STAMPS YOU GET A LITTLE
TASTE OF THAT TOO. BUT DON'TTHINK OF IT AS JP MORGAN
SHORTING HOMEOWNERS THINK OFTHEM AS
GOING LONG ON HUNGER.
[LAUGHTER]BUT I ASSUME THEY THEN PUTSOME OF THAT MONEY
THAT THEY GOT INTO CREATING JOBSFOR THE FEW NONLAZY AMERICANS
LEFT.
>> TO SAVE MONEY, JP MORGAN HASBEEN ROUTING BENEFIT CARD
CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL TO INDIAWHERE EMPLOYEES REPORTEDLY EARN
NO MORE THAN $3.50 AN HOUR.
>> Jon: WELL THAT MAKESSENSE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HIRE
AMERICANS THAT WOULD CUT INTOYOUR LUCRATIVE FOOD STAMP
BUSINESS. YOU HAVE TOMAINTAIN YOUR BASE.
SO WHAT I'M GETTING FROM FOX ISTHIS, EXPLOITING GOVERNMENT
LARGESSE WHILE REPREHENSIVEAND MORALLY CORRUPTING FOR
AN INDIVIDUAL IS OKAYFOR CORPORATIONS.
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP. DON'TTHINK ABOUT FOODSTAMPS AND
HEADSTART AND PROGRAMSLIKE THAT AS FEEDING AND
HELPING A SMALL CHILD. THINKABOUT IT AS INVESTING
IN A PROMISING START-UP WITH ALIQUIDITY PROBLEM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
