DO YOU KNOW HIS MOTHER IS
WHITE?

HE ASSOCIATES WITH
UNREPENTANT CAPITALISTS AND THE
RADICAL MADRASAH HE WENT TO IS
HARVARD LAW, WHICH AS FAR AS
MADRASAHS go,
IS VERY LIBERAL.

GO AHEAD.
>> SO THEY ARE PULLING FOR
McCAIN OVER THERE?
>> WELL, HE POLLED STRONGLY IN
THE TRADITIONAL RED CAVES, BUT
IT COMES DOWN TO DEMOGRAPHICS,
THE YOUNGER TERRORISTS SUPPORT
OBAMA, TERRORISTS BETWEEN 25 AND
30 LIKE McCAIN.

>> YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
TERRORISM, DO YOU, JON?
