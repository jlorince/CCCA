>> Jon: WELCOMEBACK. NOW 13 YEARS AGO,
WAS IT 13 YEARS AGO, 13 YEARSAGO WHEN AL QAEDA WAS OUR
TOP TERRORIST ENEMY WE KNEWAL QAEDA WANTED TO ATTACK
AMERICA.
THEY HAD ALREADY BOMBED THEWORLD TRADE CENTER IN 1993.
AND TWO, WE GOT A MEMO THATSAID THAT THEY WANTED TO DO
THAT.
KIND OF A GIVEAWAY.
IS ISIS THE SAME KIND OFTHREAT TO AMERICA?
>> WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY, OFCOURSE, THAT INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS DON'T BELIEVEISIS RIGHT NOW POSES A
THREAT TO THE U.S. HOMELAND.
>> Jon: OR TO PUT THAT IN ADIFFERENT WAY.
>> THIS IS NOT SOMALIA THISIS NOT YEMEN, THIS IS A
TURNING POINT IN THE WAR ONTERROR.
OUR STRATEGY WILL FAIL YETAGAIN.
THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISETO THE OCCASION BEFORE WE
ALL GET KILLED BACK HERE ATHOME.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: HERE'S MY IMPRESSION
OF EVERYONE WHO CRAWLED OUT OFBED HUNGOVER SUNDAY MORNING
AND TURNED ON THE TV TO SEELINDSEY GRAHAM.
>> BEFORE WE ALL GET KILLEDBACK HERE AT HOME.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: REALLY?
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ALL OF US?
(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE-- OF COURSE WE
HAVE TO TAKE THE-- WE'RE ALLGOING TO DIE-- WE HAVE TO
TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLYBECAUSE OF LINDSEY GRAHAM'S
REPUTATION FOR EVEN-KEELEDUNDERSTATEMENT, LIKE WHEN HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT NOTLETTING PEOPLE HAVE ASSAULT
WEAPONS.
>> IF MY FAMILY WAS IN THECROSS HAIRS OF GANGS THAT
WERE ROAMING AROUNDNEIGHBORHOODS IN NEW ORLEANS
OR ANY OTHER LOCATION, THEDETERRENT EFFECT OF AN AR-15
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY I THINKIS GREATER THAN A DOUBLE
BARREL SHOTGUN.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: ON BALANCING THE
BUDGET.
>> ALL THIS TALK ABOUT FEAR,IT'S REAL.
WE'RE ON AN UNSUSTAINABLEPATH WHEN IT COMES TO OUR
NATION.
>> Jon: ON IRAN'S NUCLEARPROGRAM.
>> WE'RE WALKING DOWN THEROAD TO ARMAGEDDON.
>> Jon: THE POOR MAN LIVESHIS ENTIRE LIFE TRAPPED IN
THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, I HAVE SEEN
CHIHUAHUAS IN HANDBAGS WHO ARE
LESS FRETFUL AND SHAKING.
(LAUGHTER)BUT EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE,
LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS SUSTAINEDTHIS LEVEL OF PANIC FOR 13
YEARS. EVEN THOUGHMANY OF THE BOOGEYMEN THAT LIVE
UNDER HIS BED, AREN'T REALLYTHERE AT ALL.
>> THERE WILL BE NO PEACE IN
OUR TIME AS LONG AS WE HAVETHE POLITICS OF APPEASEMENT
AND LET A GUY LIKE SADDAMHUSSEIN GET AWAY WITH
BUILDING MOBILE BIOLOGICALWEAPONS SYSTEMS, LARGER
MISSILES, PROCURRING MATERIALSTHAT COULD ONLY BE USED IN
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
FOR US TO SIT BACK WOULD BE ANATIONAL TRAVESTY.
>> ACT NOW OR WE WILL PAYLATER.
>> Jon: DID I SAY OR, IMEANT AND.

THOUGHT IT WAS SADDAMHUSSEIN.
>> Jon: ALRIGHT, LOOK. THISIS...
>> STAY BACK YOU! DON'T COME...OH WAIT, MERCY ME, I THOUGHT WAS
