[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU THISEVENING.
MY GUEST TONIGHT COLUMNISTCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER
IS JOINING US.
BUT FIRST 50 YEARS AGO IN DALLASAN ASSASSINATION THAT CHANGED --
SORRY I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING ADISCUSSION EARLIER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]EARLIER TONIGHT WE WERE HAVING A
SPIRITED AND INTERESTINGDISCUSSION.
I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A WITTYJOKE ABOUT IT.
WE BEGIN ON WALL STREET.
IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE THEFINANCIAL COLLAPSE THAT TANKED
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
WHILE NO ONE HAS BEEN SENT TOJAIL OR COMMUNITY SERVICE OR
EVEN HAD A ONE HOUR TIME OUT INA ROOM OR FACED THE REALITY
OF CAUSING A SELF INFLICTEDECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. MAYBE
IT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.
>> JP MORGAN AND THE JUSTICEDEPARTMENT HAVE TENTATIVELY
AGREED TO A 13 BILLIONCIVEL SETTLEMENT.
>> $13 BILLION SETTLEMENT WITH>> $1THE GOVERNMENT TO ENDWITH
INVESTIGATIONS INTOBAD LOANS.
>> THEY SAY JP MORGAN KNOWINGLY>>MISLED INVESTORS BY SELLINGLY
SECURITIES THAT WEREBACKED BY RISKY MORTGAGES.
>> Jon: RISKY MORTGAGES.
IT SEEMS SO MUCH COOLER WHEN TOMCRUISE WAS IN THAT MOVIE. HIS
PARENTS WERE OUT OF TOWN AND HIMAND HIS FRIENDS CONVINCED PEOPLE
TO TAKE ON IMPROPERLYCOLLATERALIZED LOANS AND THEN
PACKAGED THE LOANS WITH A SULTRYDERIVATIVES TRADER. I REMEMBER
HER. AND THAT GUY WHO WENT ON TOPLAY BOOGER.
THAT'S WHY SO MANY TRADERS WORKIN A BUTTON DOWN AND UNDERPANTS.
$13 BILLION WHAT LUCKY BASTARDSARE GETTING A BITE OF THAT
CHEESE.
$6 BILLION GOES TOWARDS INVESTORCOMPENSATION $4 BILLION FOR
HOMEOWNER RELIEF AND $2 BILLIONIN PENALTY FINES BUT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS TO PAY JPMORGAN'S $8 SETTLEMENT
PROCESSING FEES.
DAMN YOU BANK FEES.
DAMN YOU AND YOUR BANK!
YOU KNOW WHO MUST BE THRILLED TOYOUHEAR THIS NEWS? FINANCIALD TO
ANALYSTS AND BUSINESS REPORTERS
WHO AFTER YEARS OF COVERINGCORPORATE MISDEEDS ARE SEEING
JUSTICE SERVED.
>> WHAT IS UP WITH THISINCREDIBLE $13 BILLION SHAKE
DOWN OF JP MORGAN.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FEELSLIKE IT NEEDS SCALPS.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS ATWAR.
>> IS IT A WITCH HUNT.
>> IT'S A JIHAD AGAINST JPMORGAN.
>> Jon: IT'S A SHAKE DOWN,WITCHHUNT SCALPING JIHAD.
SO WAIT, WHAT I SAW IS AMUTUALLY NEGOTIATED COMPENSATORY
AGREEMENT RELATED TO SHAKYBUSINESS DEALINGS YOU SEE IT
AS A SHAKEDOWN WITCHHUNTSCALPING JIHAD.
IT'S LIKE IF THE HOLOCAUST HADSEX WITH SLAVERY WHILE THE LAST
TEN SECONDS OF HUMAN CENTIPEDEWATCHED.
I'LL BITE.
WHAT IS THE GREAT INJUSTICE DONETO JP MORGAN CHASE HERE?
>> 80% OF THE MORTGAGE BACKEDSECURITIES THEY ARE PUNISHED FOR
WERE ACQUIRED WHEN THEY GOT BEARSTERNS --
TO SOME DEGREE IT SEEMS WRONGTHAT JP MORGAN HAS TO PAY FOR
WHAT HAPPENED.
>> WHAT JURY IS GOING TO HOLD JPMORGAN CHASE LIABLE FOR THE
DOCUMENTS THAT BEAR STERNS SOLD TO PEOPLE
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING WHY ISRESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOCUMENTS OF
OF ACOMPANY THAT THEY BOUGHT?
BUT I GUESS BECAUSE THEY BOUGHTTHE COMPANY. BUT IF THIS
IS NEW WAY YOUWANT TO RUN IT NOW.
I OWE JP MORGAN CHASE $500,000ON MY MORTGAGE AND I DECIDED
(bleep) THIS PLACE.
I'M GOING TO SELL IT FOR 50,000AND WALK AWAY
WITH THE MONEY.
UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM THEGUY WHO BUYS IT DOESN'T OWE YOU
GUYS (bleep).
PROBLEMS YOU CAUSE DON'TDISAPPEAR BECAUSE SOMEONE BUYS
YOU.
THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRICE.
YOU KNOW WHO KNEW THAT?
JAMIE DIMON FROM JP MORGANCHASE.
HE TOLD INVESTORS ANY LIABILITYRELATED TO THE ASSETS WILL COME
WITH US.
HE BRACED HIS COMPANY FOR BYSETTING ASIDE A 28 BILLION
RAINY DAY SETTLEMENT FUND ANDGUESS WHAT?
IT'S RAINING (bleep).
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THIS GOVERNMENTSETTLEMENT IS $15 BILLION LESS
THAN WHAT DIMON THOUGHT ITMIGHT BE.
THE ONLY WAY THIS SETTLEMENTCOULD GET SWEETER IS IT IF IT
WAS TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
>> IT COULD BE DOWN TO $9BILLION.
>> BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF DEALIS EXPECTED TO BE TAX
DEDUCTIBLE.
>> SON OF A BITCH. THISCONFIRMS WHAT I SAID SETTLEMENTS
FOR CORPORATE FRAUD ANDMALFEASANCE
AND DONATIONS TO BREASTCANCER CHARITIES
