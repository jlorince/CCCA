OF COURSE INVOLUNTARY HORSE SNACKING ONE OF THE THINGS AMERICANS DIDN'T HAVE TONE
DURING LAST WEEK.
>> IN A REMOTE PART OF RUSSIA A METEOR TRAVELED TO EARTH AND EXPLODED.
>> IT CARRIED A CONTRAIL AND HIT THE ATMOSPHERE AND EXPLODED WITH THE FORCE OF AN ATOMIC BOMB.
>> Jon: ON THE BRIGHT SIDE DID IT PROVIDE RUSSIA WITH A FLEETING SENSE OF WARMTH.
[LAUGHTER]
THIS WAS SCARY NOT LIKE A SOLAR ECLIPSE.
YEAH.
WASN'T LIKE A SOLAR ECLIPSE.
NO ONE KNEW IT WAS COMING.
HOW DID THESE RUSSIANS GET THE FOOTAGE?
>> A MAJORITY WAS RECORDED PURELY BY CHANCE, CAPTURED BY SMALL DASH MOUNTED CAMERAS THAT
ARE THE LATEST FAD AMONG RUSSIAN CAR OWNERS.
>> Jon: LET'S ROLL THE CAMERA AGAIN WITH THE SOUND UP.
I'M GOING TO LEARN THE RUSSIAN FOR HOLY (bleep) BALL.
[RADIO NOISE]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE GUY IN THE CAR DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING.
THAT'S MORE AMAZING THAN THE FOOTAGE ITSELF.
THE GUY IN THE CAR IS COMPLETELY UNIMPRESSED BY A DEATH ROCK HURLING TOWARDS THE CITY.
IS EVERYONE IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY JUST THAT JADED?
>> MOTORISTS HAVE TURNED TO DASH CAMS FOR SELF PROTECTION.
VISUAL PROOF TO FEND OFF CHARGES FROM POSSIBLEIBLY CORRUPT POLICE OFFICERS AND FROM INSURANCE
SCAMMERS WHO OFTEN STAGE ACCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE CAPTURED HERE.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD, THAT MAN NEEDS HELP.
GET HIM TO ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER STAT.
HE NEEDS 300CC'S OF ACTOR-ALL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK WHAT WE SEEM TO BE LEARNING IS THAT RUSSIANS IN THE COURSE OF THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES
SEE SO MUCH CRAZY (bleep) THEY'VE BECOME UNPHASABLE.
THEY'VE LONG BEEN ACCUSTOM TO THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE RUSSIAN CAR CAN EASILY BE TORN
APART BY YOUR AVERAGE RUSSIAN WOMAN.
I WANT BUMPER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PUT CHEESE ON, EAT.
MMMMM.
I MEAN THIS TYPICAL ROADSIDE SCENE TWO DRIVERS CONFRONT EACH OTHER WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND
YES, THAT IS A HATCHET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RUSSIA IS LIKE A LIVE ACTION GRAND THEFT AUTO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF THERE'S A SURPRISING PART OF THE VIDEO IS THAT THOSE GENTLEMEN ARRIVED AT SOME SORT
OF AGREEMENT NOT TO BAT AND HATCHET EACH OTHER TO DEATH.
APPARENTLY IN RUSSIA IT'S COMMON FOR YOUR COMMUTE TO INVOLVE A HATCHET BAT DISPUTE, A FIGHTER
JET FLY BY OR I DON'T KNOW BANG!
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW UNPHASED ARE RUSSIANS?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: EVEN THE COWS -- THIS IS HOW UNPHASED RUSSIANS ARE, EVEN THEIR COWS IN A MASS COW
TIPPING JUST (bleep) GET UP AND ARE LIKE --
[LAUGHTER]
YES, FOLKS AMERICA MAY BE (bleep) BUT NOT AS BAD AS THIS.
