SWEETNESS YOU FEEL IS MERELY A
BUBBLE YOUR MOM AND I HAVE
CREATED.
WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR
CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE VIDEO HAS GOTTEN A HUGE
REACTION ONLINE.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
>> TWO WORDS, JON.
CYBER BULLYING.
>> Jon: WAIT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SOME POOR GUY NAMED JOEY
MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS IN
AFRICA AND SUDDENLY 74 MILLION
PEOPLE ARE MAKING HIM FEEL
LIKE AN OUTCAST.
AND WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: AL, I DON'T THINK IT'S
BECAUSE EELS DIFFERENT.
>> THIS IS A....
>> I KNOW, JON.
BUT THIS VIDEO IS VERY
DANGEROUS.
>> Jon: HOW IS IT DANGEROUS?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
>> BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE
LEARNING FROM IT AND WANTING
TO GET INVOLVED.
IT THREATENS AMERICA'S LONG
TRADITION OF IGNORANCE-BASED
FOREIGN POLICY.
( APPLAUSE )
SEE GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME, JON,
WE CAN BE TRUSTED WITH
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STUFF LIKE
THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TOO TIRED
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
OUR HOPES AND DREAMS HAVE DIED
YEARS AGO.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> WE ARE DEAD INSIDE.
BUT YOUNG PEOPLE, I MEAN, THEY
THINK THEY CAN CHANGE THE
WORLD.
AND THEY HAVE THE ENERGY TO DO
IT.
ALL IT TAKES A ONE HOT DAD ON
YOU-TUBE AND SUDDENLY UGANDA
IS OUR PROBLEM?
YOU KNOW, DRUG GANGS ARE DOING
THE SAME (BEEP) DOWN IN MEXICO
AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS.
>> Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> LET'S JUST HOPE NOBODY
MAKES A CATCHY VIDEO ABOUT IT
OR THE YOUNGS WILL BE UP OUR
COOL-OS... THAT MEANS DO
SOMETHING (BEEP).
>> Jon: I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE OVERREACTING HERE.
I DON'T THINK YOUNG PEOPLE ARE
THAT IMPRESSIONABLE.
LET'S BRING IN JESSICA
WILLIAMS OUR SENIOR YOUTH
CORRESPONDENT TO GET HER TAKE.
>> DID YOU SEE THIS KONY
VIDEO?
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS GUY.
WHO WANTS TO GO ALL NIGHT WITH
ME AND HANG UP SOME POSTERS?
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: DUDE, THIS IS SERIOUS.
>> I TOLD YOU.
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE POWERLESS
BEFORE VIRAL VIDEOS.
IT'S HOW THEY LEARN ABOUT THE
WORLD.
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK THERE ARE
OTHER PLACES THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO WANT US TO CARE
ABOUT?
>> THINK?
WATCH THIS.
HEY, JESSICA,.
>> YEAH.
>> TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT SYRIA.
>> SYRIA.
OH, YES, HE TELLS ME WHAT TO
DO WHEN I'M TALKING TO MY
PHONE.
>> Jon: SYRIA IS A COUNTRY IN
THE MIDDLE EAST, AN UPRISING
THERE IS BEING BRUTALLY
SUPPRESSED.
MANY ARE DYING.
SHE DIDN'T GIVE A (BEEP) ABOUT
SYRIA.
>> JON, ALLOW ME.
HEY, JESSICA.
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT NEW VIDEO
WITH THE DOG?
>> WHAT?
A NEW VIDEO WITH A DOG.
COUNT ME IN.
>> SYRIA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT?
THE ARAB SPRING CAME AND THE
SYRIANS STARTEDED PROTESTING
FOR THEIR RIGHTS.
>> COOL.
FREEDOM IS GREAT.
>> FREEDOM IS GREAT.
>> BUT THERE'S A STILL CALLS
HOMS.
>> NORTH OF LEBANON, SURE.
>> PEOPLE THERE PROTESTED AND
THE ARMY SHOWED UP.
>> YEAH.
INSTEAD OF LETTING THE SYRIANS
VOICE THEIR DISCONTENT THEY
STARTED SHELLING HOMS.
>> IT'S A WAR CRIME.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
SYRIA.
DO SOMETHING WITH SYRIA.
>> LET ME CHECK ON THAT.
>> Jon: WELL DONE.
AL MADRIGAL.
JESSICA WILLIAMS, YOU WERE
RIGHT.
I HAD NO IDEA.
