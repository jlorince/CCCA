>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I AM SO
EXCITED TO BE BACK.
I LEARNED AN AWFUL LOT THIS
SUMMER.
ONE, I LEARNED I HAVE THE BARD
OF A 90-YEAR-OLD PROSPECTOR.
I LEARNED THAT I AM WESTERN.
BECAUSE FOR ALL THAT I
APPRECIATED AND LEARNED ABOUT
THE CULTURE THAT I WAS IMMERSED
IN, BOY, I AM WESTERN.
IN ALL ITS GLORIOUS DECADENT
IMPER TECH SHUNLS, I RECALL
DRIVING BACK TO NEW YORK CITY
THINKING, HELLO DILDO SHOP NEAR
A SCHOOL.
I LEARNED SOMETHING I ALREADY
KNEW WHICH IS I TRULY HAVE THE
FINEST STAFF AND CREW IN ALL OF
TELEVISION AND I WANT TO THANK
THEM.
THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> I WILL SAY THIS.
HERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I KNEW.
I KNEW JOHN OLIVER WAS
INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND DO
GREAT.
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT JOHN
OLIVER HAS DIMPLES YOU CAN LOSE
YOURSELF IN.
I WOULD LIKE TO BRING OUR THE
MAN OF THE SUMMER, MR. JOHN
OLIVER.

GENTLEMEN!

REGIS PHILBIN KISSED ME ON THE
HEAD.
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.
REMEMBER YOUR FRIEND ANTHONY
WEINER?
>> YES, YES!  HOW IS HE DOING?
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN WITH HIM IN A
WHILE,?
>> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION.
FOR A START, NO ONE REALLY CALLS
HIM ANTHONY WEINER ANYMORE.
>> Stewart: OH, GO AHEAD, GO
AHEAD.
>> THEY CALL HIM MR. MAYOR IS
THAT WHAT IT IS?
>> SOME SORT OF ALTER EGO.
>> HE ACTUALLY DOES, A VERY REAL
ALTER EGO.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
HE DOES HAVE THAT.
>> Stewart: WHAT IS THAT?
>> DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT.
>> Stewart: NO.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

COULD BIT?
>> WELL, LET ME TELL YOU.
IT IS CARLOS DANGER!
>> DANGER!
>>
>> Stewart: WHY DID THAT JUST
HAPPEN?  WHAT WAS THAT?
>> LISTEN, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
GOING.
WHAT KIND OF FUN STORY AM I
GETTING BACK TO?  LIKE A
COMPTROLLER IN NEW YORK THAT
TAKES SELFIES OF HIMSELF?
RACIAL RAGE?  SOMETHING TERRIBLE
ABOUT CHINESE PEOPLE?  WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT LINED UP FOR TODAY.
>> AFTER NEARLY TWO AND A HALF
YEARS OF CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA,
MULTIPLE REPORTS OF LARGE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACKS IN 25
YEARS, THE WHITE HOUSE IS POISED
FOR ACTION AGAINST PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
>> Stewart: GOOD LUCK WITH
THAT!  WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
MAYBE WE CAN STILL HAVE SOME
FUN.
THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA SEEM TO BE
IN A LOT OF DANGER.
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT DOES NOT WORK LIKE THAT!
ANYWAY YOU CAN HAVE FUN AND IT
IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK.
ONE MORE THING.
