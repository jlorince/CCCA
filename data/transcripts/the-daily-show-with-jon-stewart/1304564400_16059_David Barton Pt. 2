SAY ABOUT THAT.
BUT LET'S GET TO YOU BECAUSE I
DO... YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT
FIGURE.
YOU GO IN AND YOU ARGUE IN FRONT
OF THE SUPREME COURT.
YOU GO IN AND YOU WORK WITH OUR
CONGRESS.
YOU WORK WITH CONGRESS PEOPLE.
YOU GO IN AND YOU WRITE
CURRICULUM, AND I CAN'T HELP BUT
THINK THAT, AND IN YOUR
WRITINGS, YOU TALK ABOUT
RECLAIMING OUR FORGOTTEN
HISTORY.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHEN IT SEEMS TO ME
SOMEONE WHO PROBABLY HAS A VERY
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THIS
NATION'S HISTORY THAT YOU ARE
REWRITING MORE THAN RECLAIMING.
>> LET ME GIVE A SHOT AT THAT.
ONE THING I'M REALLY PROUD ABOUT
THAT WE GOT DONE IN TEXAS IS WE
TOOK THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES
WHO ARE COVERED IN THE STANDARDS
FROM 9% TO 25%.
THE WAY I DID IT IS SAID WE'RE
NOT COVERING ANY OF THE JEWISH
FOUNDING FATHERS OR THE BLACK
FOUNDING FATHERS, THE WOMEN OF
THE REVOLUTION.
WE'RE ALSO NOT COVERING
HISPANICS IN THE REVOLUTION.
THAT'S FORGOTTEN HISTORY.
I BET YOU MOST JEWISH PEOPLE
CAN'T NAME THE JEWISH FOUNDING
FATHERS.
>> Jon: I CAN.
SANDY KOUFAX.
>> EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SANDY KOUFAX.
THAT'S ALL I GOT.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: SO I AM INCORRECT IN
SAYING THAT YOU... I'VE SEEN
TAPES OF YOU SPEAKING WHERE YOU
MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
BASED ON THE BIBLE, THINGS LIKE
I WOULD LIKE THE SEE THE CAPITAL
GAINS TAX AND THE ESTATE TAX
GONE BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT THOSE ARE ALSO SPEECHES
GIVEN TO GROUPS OF MINISTERS,
AND I'M SPEAKING TO MINISTERS.
THAT'S NOT A TEXTBOOK.
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
SETTING.
FOR EXAMPLE...
>> Jon: YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS
A WALL OF SEPARATION?
>> THERE IS.
AND THAT IS... YOU GOT TO
UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT CAME FROM,
TOO.
>> Jon: A WALL OF SEPARATION
WITHIN YOU OF CHURCH AND STATE?
>> NO, NO, ANY MORE THAN THE
FOUNDERS WANTED IT.
THEY WANTED SEPARATION OF THE
INSTITUTIONS, NEVER SEPARATION
OF THE INFLUENCE.
NEVER AT ANY POINT DID THEY
SAY...
>> THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS
THE ROAD HERE BECAUSE THAT'S
KIND OF WHAT I'M GETTING TO.
AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT PROTEST
THAT YOUR MAIN THRUST IS NOT TO
GET US BACK TO THIS IDEA THAT
THE FOUNDERS DIDN'T WANT
RELIGION SEPARATED FROM THE
STATE, THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU
PULL, GOING OFF THE
CONSTITUTION, IT DOESN'T MENTION
THE CREATOR.
IT DOESN'T MENTION JESUS.
IT DOESN'T MENTION PRAYING IN
ANY WAY.
SO WOULDN'T THEY BE EXPLICIT IN
THE MENTION OF RELIGION IF THEY
HAD WANTED IT SO BECAUSE THEY
WERE NOT COY PEOPLE FOR THE MOST
PART.
>> THEY WERE NOT COY.
THEY WERE VERY BLUNT.
WHEN YOU READ THE FEDERALIST
PAPERS, THEY SAID RELIGION
BELONGS TO THE STATE.
YOU READ THE STATE
CONSTITUTIONS, THEY'RE EXTREMELY
GRAPHIC ON RELIGION, BUT THERE
ARE SEVEN REFERENCES IN THE
CONSTITUTION TO RELIGION,
WHETHER IT BE ARTICLE 7.
AND BY THE WAY, THE DECLARATION
IS INCORPORATED INTO THE
CONSTITUTION, SO THERE'S FOUR
REFERENCES TO GODS IN ARTICLE 7.
>> Jon: REFERENCES TO GOD ARE
VERY DIFFERENT THAN EXPLICIT...
THEY WERE SO EXPLICIT THAT IF
YOU WANT TO HOLD THIS OFFICE,
YOU HAVE TO BE THIS AGE.
BLACK PEOPLE COUNTED FOR
THREE-FIFTHS.
THEY USED FRACTIONS.
>> THAT'S ONLY FEDERAL OFFICE.
THAT'S NOT RELIGION.
>> Jon: BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN
SAY... THERE IS AN OATH OF
OFFICE FOR THE PRESIDENT IS
TRANSCRIBED WORD FOR WORD IN THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT THEY DON'T SAY YOU
HAVE TO DO IT ON A BIBLE, AND
THEY DON'T MENTION GOD.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT THE STATE LAWS IN ALL 13
STATES REQUIRED EVERY OATH TO BE
DONE ON A BIBLE AND MENTION GOD.
>> Jon: BUT ONLY THREE OF THEM
WERE STILL THERE.
THAT LITMUS TEST WAS ONLY THERE
WHEN THE BILL OF RIGHTS CAME
INTO EFFECTED, ONLY THREE STATES
STILL HAD THOSE LAWS AND THE
FOUNDERS HAD BEEN TRYING THE
PHASE THAT OUT.
>> LET'S TAKE THE RELIGION SIDE.
THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS
"CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW
RESPECTING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF
RELIGION."
ONE CASE IN THE U.S. SUPREME
COURT WAS RABBILESSLY GUTTERMAN
WAS ASKED IF PROVIDENCE, RHODE
ISLAND TO, GIVE A PRAYER AT A
GRADUATION, AND HE WASN'T
ALLOWED TO.
NOW, TELL ME HOW CONGRESS SHALL
MAKE NO LAW MEANS THAT A RABBI
CAN'T SAY THE WORD "GOD" AT A
PRAYERMENT THAT'S A PRETTY
STRANGE PARSING OF THE
CONSTITUTION.
AND THAT'S WHAT I ARGUE IS
CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW AS A
RESTRICTION ON CONGRESS.
IT'S NOT A RESTRICTION ON THE
RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO SAY THE WORD
"GOD" IN PUBLIC.
>> Jon: DO WE HAVE TO GO?
DAMMIT.
CAN WE GO AND THEN COME BACK?
DO YOU MIND STICKING AROUND?
>> HAPPY TO.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE KIND OF
CONVERSATION THAT I DON'T GET.
SO I'M GOING TO
