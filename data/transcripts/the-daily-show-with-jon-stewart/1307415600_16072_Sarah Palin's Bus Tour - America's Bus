SO IT'S A GOTCHA QUESTION.
MEANWHILE THE BUS TOUR ROLLS
ON.
JOHN OLIVER HAS THIS REPORT.
>> Reporter: LAST WEEK SARAH
PALIN'S NON-SEEKING AMERICANA
VACATION TOUR HIT THE MOST
HISTORIC SIGHTS ON THE EAST
COAST.
BUT THE MEDIA MISSED THE
BIGGEST STORY OF ALL.
THE BUS ITSELF.
THIS 46-FEET FLAG DIPPED
LIBERTY COACH TOOK OUR
GREATEST TREASURES AND PUT
THEM IN A SPACE NORMALLY
RESERVED FOR OUR FIGHTERS.
THOSE WHO SAW IT WERE HUMBLED
BY ITS POWER.
>> I WILL NEVER FORGET IT.
THE BUS WAS JUST GORGEOUS.
BEAUTIFUL.
>> HAS THE CONSTITUTION EVER
LOOKED BETTER THAN SPLASHED ON
THE SIDE OF A BUS?
>> IF IT HAS, I HAVEN'T SEEN
IT.
>> BECAUSE THE BUS DRIVES INTO
YOUR MEMORY AND PARKS AND THEN
NEVER LEAVES.
>> RIGHT.
I'LL SEE THAT BUS FOREVER.
>> SARAH PALIN'S BUS WAS A
FEAST FOR THE SENSES.
YOU JUST WANT TO GET ON HER
AND RIDE HER FOR HOURS AND
HOURS AND HOURS.
>> STAY ON HER FOREVER.
>> RIGHT.
>> YEP.
ABSOLUTELY.
>> WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
NOW?
>> THE BUS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THE BUS.
THE BUS.
>> YEAH.
>> SHE'S SPACIOUS ONCE YOU GET
INSIDE HER.
>> JUST LOOKING AT HER, I'D
SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
>> JUST TO BE SAFE, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE BUS.
>> THE BUS.
>> OF COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA DIDN'T APPRECIATE THIS
OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.
>> IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING
FOLLOWING HER.
NO ADDRESSES, NO EYE TIN RE,
NO INFORMATION.
>> SHE'S THROWING US TINY
CRUMBS.
>> WE PROBABLY DESERVE A
SCHEDULE AT THE VERY LEAST.
>> THEY COULDN'T EVEN CATCH A
STORY IF IT FELL RIGHT INTO
THEIR LAPS.
>> AT THE VERY LEAST YOU'VE
INTERVIEWED THIS BUS'S BIGGEST
SUPER FAN.
>> WHO IS THAT?
>> SO YOU HAVEN'T INTERVIEWED
HIM EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LOOKING
AT HIM RIGHT NOW.
INTERVIEW HIM ABOUT THE BUS.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
BUS?
>> I (BEEP) LOVE THE BUS.
QUESTION TWO.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
WAS THAT IT?
OKAY.
>> HOW MANY PSIs ARE IN THE
TIRES OF THIS BUS.
>> THAT'S JUST EXACTLY THE
KIND OF GOTCHA JOURNALISM THAT
YOU MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAVE
BECOME FAMOUS FOR.
BUT IF THIS BUS TOUR WAS ABOUT
ANYTHING IT WAS ABOUT
EDUCATING AMERICA.
HAVE YOU EVER READ THE
CONSTITUTION?
>> YES.
>> HAVE YOU EVERY READ THE
CONSTITUTION ON THE SIDE OF A
BUS?
>> NO.
>> EXACTLY.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
IT WAS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.
>> I READ "WE THE PEOPLE" BUT
THE REST OF THE WORDS WERE
KIND OF BLURRY AND TOO SMALL
TO READ.
>> THE BUS TRULY REPRESENTS
EVERYTHING GREAT ABOUT
AMERICA.
IT'S BIG.
IT'S BRASH.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SMCHLT...
(BEEP) ON IT.
NO MATTER HOW FAR IT ROAMS IT
WILL ALWAYS BE CLOSE TO US.
>> WHERE IS THE BUS?
>> THE BUS IS A COUPLE MILES
AWAY I BELIEVE.
>> SURE.
IT WAS JUST A COUPLE MILES
AWAY IN OUR HEARTS.
