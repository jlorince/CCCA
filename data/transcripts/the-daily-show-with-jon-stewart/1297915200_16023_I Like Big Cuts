MEANWHILE, BACK IN WASHINGTON
PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED HIS
BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012.
APPARENTLY IN PHONEBOOK FORM.
[LAUGHTER]
THE BUDGET CALL TOWARDS $3.7
TRILLION IN SPENDING WHICH IS, I
KNOW, A DIFFICULT NUMBER TO WRAP
YOUR HEADS AROUND.
PERHAPS THIS DEMONSTRATION WILL
IN NO WAY CLARIFY THINGS FOR
YOU.
>> WE GOT THE PENNIES AND
STACKED THEM UNTIL WE GOT THIS
BUDGET.
EACH ONE STACK OF THESE FIVE
PENNIES REPRESENTS $2 BILLION.
>> Jon: THAT DOESN'T HELP US
IN ANYWAY.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME DO A QUICK IMPRESSION OF
YOU OF AN EMPLOYEE AT ABC WORLD
NEWS.
I WENT TO COLOMBIA UNIVERSITY --
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND NOW I'M
STACKING PENNIES PENNIES TO MAKE A PIE
CHART.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
LET'S GET TO THE BUDGET.
$3.7 BILLION.
THE TRICK IS TO GET IT TO VASTLY
INCREASE THE DEFICIT WHILE
GIVING AMERICANS THE SHOTY
DEMOCRACY WE EXPECT OR ARE AT
LEAST NUMB TO.
>> SOME OF THE SAVINGS COME
THROUGH LESS WASTE AND MORE
EFFICIENCY.
WE'LL SPEND BILLIONS OF GETTING
RID OF 14,000 OFFICE BUILDINGS,
LOTS AND GOVERNMENT-OWNED
PROPERTIES WE NO LONGER NEED.
>> Jon: FROM NOW ON WHEN WE
BUY OFFICE SUPPLIES WE'LL JOIN
UP WITH CANADA AND MEXICO TO
LOOK FOR DEALS ON GROUPON.
[LAUGHTER]
THE BUDGET WOULD CUT SUCH
ENTITLEMENT STAPLES AS THE HOME
HEATING ASSISTANCE AND PELL
GRANTS.
MAYBE REPUBLICANS HAVE A
STRONGER PLAN FOR GETTING THE
DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL.
>> REPUBLICANS WANT TO TAKE OUT
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
>> THE ELIMINATION OFMEN CORPS,
FOR EXAMPLE.
>> THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A NEW
TARGET PBS AND NPR.
>> Jon: AT LEAST WE AGREE THAT
THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS SPHES
TO EFFECT PROGRAMS OF PEOPLE
THAT VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS.
OBAMA WOULD SAVE $1.1 TRILLION.
JEFF SESSIONS, RANKING
REPUBLICAN ON THE SENATE BUDGET
COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH BEST KNOWN
FOR HIS 1996 COLLABORATION WITH
BOB DYLAN.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WILL BRING BACK (bleep)
PICTURE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT GUY HAS GOT TO BE PLEASED
WITH THE CUTS.
>> WHEN YOU HEAR THE $1.1
TRILLION IN SAVINGS OVER TEN
YEARS, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE?
IS THAT A GOOD START, SENATOR?
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
I EXPECT ACCORDING TO
PROJECTIONS $12 TRILLION TO $14
TRILLION IN NEW ADDED DURING
THAT TIME.
SO A $1 TRILLION REDUCTION IS
INSIGNIFICANT AND DOES NOT GET
US OFF TO THE RIGHT COURSE.
>> Jon: WOW HE SAID THE
TRILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS IS
INSIGNIFICANT.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
REPUBLICAN PLAN TO SAVE THE
IDENTICAL AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER
THE SAME TIME.
>> $100 BILLION MEANS OVER TEN
YEARS YOU WOULD HAVE A $1
TRILLION SAVINGS.
THIS IS THE WAY YOU GET THE
BUDGET BALANCED:
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SERIOUSLY WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO BUY A FORD?
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
IT'S A PIECE OF (bleep).
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS BUY ONE
OF I HAD FORD'S.
[LAUGHTER]
I CAN'T BELIEVE DYLAN DID AN
ALBUM WITH THAT GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S CLEAR THAT NONE OF YOU
GUYS, REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT,
HAVE TAKEN THIS SERIOUS.
I'M GOING TO DO IT MYSELF.
I'M GOING CHARLES TKPWROEDEN AND
DAVE ON YOUR ASS AND THAT IS MY
LAST REFERENCE TONIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
HOW BIG IS THE BUDGET?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BUDGET
PROPOSAL FOR THE NEXT FISCAL
YEAR CAME IN AT MORE THAN $3.7
TRILLION.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT $3.7 TRILLION.
WHAT IS THE DEFICIT?
>> THE DEFICIT $1.1 TRILLION.
>> Jon: OKAY $1.1 -- YOU KNOW
WHAT, HOLD ON?
YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.
SOMETIMES THEY NEED TO WARM UP.
[LAUGHTER]
WE'VE GOT $3.7 TRILLION UP FOR
GRABS.
88% OF THE BUDGET IS NOT
EFFECTED BY THESE CUTS.
THEY ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON THE
CUTS -- FOCUSING THE CUTS ON 12%
OF THE BUDGET.
>> Jon: WE CAN ONLY CUT FROM
12% OF THE BUDGET.
$12% IS $440 BILLION.
HERE IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
WE NEED TO GET $1.1 TRILLION OF
SPENDING CUTS OUT OF $440
BILLION.
[LAUGHTER]
SO I'M JUST GOING TO VERY
QUICKLY -- WATSON?
