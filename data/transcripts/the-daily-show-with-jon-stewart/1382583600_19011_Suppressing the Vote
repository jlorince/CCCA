>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SUPREMECOURT EFFECTIVELY STRUCK DOWN
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT SAYING ITHAD BEEN IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL AT
REDRESSING RACIAL DISCRIMINATIONSO BASICALLY SAYING ENOUGH IS
ENOUGH.
I MEAN, WHY RUIN A GOOD THING BYCONTINUING IT?
[LAUGHTER]ASSIF MANDVI REPORTS.
>> THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF1965 PROTECTED VOTERS FROM
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION UNTIL JUNEWHEN THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK
DOWN A KEY PROVISION SAYING ITWAS NO LONGER NECESSARY WHICH
RED STATES CELEBRATED BYINTRODUCING CONSTITUTIONAL
RESTRICTIVE VOTING LAWS.
>> THESE LAWS ARE JUST AS RACISTAS THEY CAN BE.
>> CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWISAPPARENTLY DOESN'T LIKE
PROGRESS.
>> IN ANOTHER TIME AND ANOTHERPERIOD, THESE DEVICES WAS USED
TO MAKE IT HARDER, MAKE ITDIFFICULT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
DOF COLOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THENPROCESS.
>> I DON'T THINK ANY PART OF LAWIS RACIST.
>> NORTH CAROLINA PRECINCTCHAIRMAN AND GOP
COMMITTEE MEMBER DON YELTINTHINKS HIS STATE'S VOTING
RESTRICTIONS ARE JUST FINE.
>> THE PROCESS WILL HAVE MOREINTEGRITY.
RIGHT HERE IN BUNKHAM COUNTYTHERE'S ONE OR TWO THAT VOTED
TWICE A YEAR.
>> ONE OR TWO MILLION PEOPLE?
>> ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.
>> ONE OR TWO OUT OF HOW MANY?
>> THAT'S JUST ONE OR TWO OUT OF60,000.
>> SO STATISTICALLY THERE'S ENOUGH
VOTER FRAUD TO SWAY ZEROELECTIONS.
>> THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
>> THE POINT IS VOTER FRAUDDOES JUST BARELY EXIST WHILE
RACISM, ACCORDING TO THE SUPREMECOURT IS A THING OF THE PAST.
>> THE SCARS AND STAINS OFRACISM ARE STILL DEEPLY EMBEDDED
IN EVERY CORNER OF AMERICANSOCIETY.
>> BUT YOU ARE JUST TALKINGABOUT RACISM, RACISM, RACISM AS
IF IT'S THE 1960'S.
IT'S NOT THE 1960'S ANYMORE.
I THINK THE MEN IN THIS PICTUREWOULD BE ASHAMED YOU ARE
THROWING AROUND THE WORD RACISMSO CAVALIERLY.
>> I AM IN THAT PICTURE.
>> WHAT?
>> I'M THERE.
>> SEE, THIS IS WHY YOU PEOPLENEED I.D.'S BECAUSE WE CAN'T
TELL YOU APART.
I MEAN, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS.
>> WE ALL DON'T LOOK ALIKE.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ALL HAVE?
THE SAME AURA OF HOPE.
>> WE NEVER GAVE UP OR BECAMEBITTER. IS THAT DENZEL
WASHINGTON?
>> NO THERE WAS THE HEAD OFNAACP.
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE LAW ISNOT RACIST.
>> OF COURSE THE LAW IS NOTRACIST AND YOU ARE NOT RACIST.
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN CALLED ABIGOT BEFORE.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ME BUT I'VETREATED YOU LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF MYBEST FRIENDS IS BLACK.
>> ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS ISBLACK?
>> YES.
>> AND THERE'S MORE.
>> WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN, YOUDIDN'T CALL A BLACK A BLACK.
YOU CALLED HIM A NEGRO.
I HAD A PICTURE OF OBAMA SITTINGON A STUMP AS A WITCH DR.
FOR YOUR INFORMATION I WASMAKING FUN OF MY WHITE HALF OF
OBAMA, NOT THE BLACK HALF.
AND NOW YOU HAVE A BLACK PERSONUSING THE TERM [BLEEP] THIS,
[BLEEP] THAT.
ANT IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO DO IT.
>> YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN HEARYOU, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN HEARYOU?
>> YES.
>> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
THEN I FOUND OUT FOR THE REALREASON FOR THE LAW.
>> THE LAW IS GOING TO KICKDEMOCRATS IN THE BUTT.
>> WOW AN EXECUTIVE G.O.P.
COMMITTEE MEMBER ADMITTED THATTHIS LAW ISN'T DESIGNED TO HURT
BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S DESIGNEDTO HURT DEMOCRATS.
>> IF IT HURTS A BUNCH OFCOLLEGE KIDS TOO LAZY TO GET UP
OFF HER BOHUNKUS AND GET A PHOTOI.D., SO BE IT.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> IF IT HURTS THE WHITES SO BEIT.
IF IT HURTS A BUNCH OF LAZYBLACKS THAT WANTS THE GOVERNMENT
TO GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, SO BEIT.
>> IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT A LOTOF THOSE PEOPLE VOTE DEMOCRAT.
>> GEE!
THAT'S RIGHT TO SUPPOSEDLYPREVENT ONE OR TWO CASES OF
FRAUD THIS LAW COULD SUPPRESSHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACTUAL
VOTERS.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THATMANY STUPID PEOPLE IN NORTH
CAROLINA AND PEOPLE THAT DON'TKNOW HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS
THAT GO DOWN THERE AND GET APHOTO I.D. FOR FREE AT THE DMV.
DO YOU WANT THOSE PEOPLE PICKINGYOUR PRESIDENT?
>> NO, WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANTSTUPID PEOPLE PICKING OUR
PRESIDENT OR DEMOCRATSAPPARENTLY.
RACISM IS OVER, YES.
>> IT'S NOT THERE YET.
>> OH, OKAY.
>> EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE SAMEOPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.
>> SO THE PLAYING FIELD SHOULDBE LEVEL?
>> MUST BE LEVEL.
THE PLAYING FIELD MUST BE LEVEL.
>> SINCE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYINGTO SUPPRESS DEMOCRATIC VOTES
PERHAPS THE ONLY FAIR WAY TOLEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IS TO
TRY TO SUPPRESS REPUBLICANVOTES.
DO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS COME INHERE?
>> NO.
>> WHEEL IT IN.
MOVE VOTING BOOTHS TO BLACK HAIRSALONS AND HERE.
ADD MANDATORY FRIENDREQUIREMENTS.
TELL REPUBLICANS TO DO WHATJESUS WOULD DO AND REMEMBER MOST
IMPORTANTLY -->> VOTE, VOTE.
>> BECAUSE I VOTED AND NOW I'MGAY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT REPUBLICANS,VOTING MAKES YOU GAY.
