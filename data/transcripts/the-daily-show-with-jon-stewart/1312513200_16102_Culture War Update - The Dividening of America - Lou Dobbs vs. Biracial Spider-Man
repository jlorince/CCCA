YOU KNOW, AMERICA'S RECENT
FISCAL TROUBLES AND STAGNATING
ECONOMY SHOULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM
THE FACT AND SHOULDN'T LET US
FORGET THAT WE ALL HATE EACH
OTHER.
[LAUGHTER]
A QUICK REMINDER OF THAT IN OUR
NEW SEGMENT "CULTURE WAR UPDATE:
THE DIVIDENING OF AMERICA."
OUR FIRST DISPATCH COMES FROM A
VETERAN CULTURE WARRIOR, MR. LOU
DOBBS, WHO SEEMED A LITTLE
ALARMED LAST NIGHT OVER A RECENT
DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD OF
COMIC BOOKS.
>> PETER PARKER, WHO WAS A WHITE
ORPHAN FROM QUEENS, WAS KILLED
OFF IN JUNE DURING A FIGHT WITH
HIS NEMESIS, THE GREEN GOBLIN.
MARVEL COMICS SAYING IT'S
REPLACING THE ICONIC CHARACTER
WITH MILES MORALES, WHO IS PART
LATINO AND PART BLACK.
>> Jon: MY GOD, IT'S LOU
DOBBS' WORST NIGHTMARE, A LATINO
THAT CAN CLIMB WALLS.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
NOT TO IN ANY WAY SUN ON HIS
PARADE, BUT THE NEW MULTIRACIAL
SPIDER-MAN APPEARS IN THE COMIC
"ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN," WHICH IS
ACTUALLY SET IN A DIFFERENT
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THAN THAT OF
THE REAL SPIDER-MAN, WHO STILL
EXISTS AND IS STILL CAUCASIAN
AND ALSO IS NOT REAL.
[LAUGHTER]
