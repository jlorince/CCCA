ALL RIGHT.
YOU MAY REMEMBER IN DECEMBER OF
2008 U.S. ATTORNEY PATRICK
FITZGERALD MADE THIS STUNNING
ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING AT THAT
TIME THE SITTING GOVERNOR OF
ILLINOIS.
>> GOVERNOR BLAGOJEVICH HAS BEEN
ARRESTED IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT
WE CAN DESCRIBE AS A POLITICAL
CORRUPTION CRIME SPREE.
THE CONDUCT WOULD MAKE LINCOLN
ROLL OVER IN HIS GRAVE.
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO TESTIFY TO
SET THE REPORT STRAIGHT.
I'M DIEING TO ANSWER THE
CHARGES.
>> Jon: SO THE STAGE WAS SET.
A YOUNG PROSECUTOR A SEEMINGLY
STUPID GOVERNOR.
IT'S LIKE.
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHO HAS THE
RIGHTS FOR MADE FOR TV MOVIE.
THIS JUST SCREAMS MADE FOR TV
MOVIE.
>> Jon: SURE, WHY NOT.
EVEN THOUGH THE HOT PROSECUTOR
PLAYED BY JERRY O'COBBLE FROM
SLIDERS NEVER PRODUCED THE
EVIDENCE HE INTIMATED HE
POSSESSED AND THE ANGRY GOVERNOR
PLAYED BY JERRY O'CONNELL'S
DUFUS BROTHER FROM THE BACHELOR,
CHARLIE, NEVER MADE IT TO THE
WITNESS STAND.
THE WITNESS PLAYED BY BLAIR
UNDERWOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M REALLY HOPING THAT THAT IS
TPOET -- PHOTO SHOPPED.
A BATTLE SURE TO HAVE A DRAMATIC
ENDING WHICH WE GOT YESTERDAY.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> FOR ROD BLAGOJEVICH, THE
FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS IS
FOUND GUILTY OF ONE COUNT MAKING
FALSE STATEMENTS TO THE F.B.I.
BUT ON 23 OTHER COUNTS THERE WAS
A DEADLOCK, A HUNG JURY.
>> Jon: THE ENDING OF THIS
MOVIE SUCKED.
WHO MADE THIS MOVIE M. NIGHT
SHAMALAN?
OH, NO I'M WRONG.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOOK AT THESE CHARGES.
RACKETEERING, MAIL FRAUD,
BRIBERY, ATTEMPTED EXTORTION,
BRIBERY SCPEERCY, ATTEMPTING
BRIBERY EXTORTION.
FILLING CHILDREN'S PARTY PINATAS
WITH NOTHING BUT SCHOOL SUPPLIES
ERASERS?
DID THE PROSECUTION EVEN COME
CLOSE IN.
>> ON THE -- COME CLOSE?
>> OWE THE MOST EXPLOSIVE CHARGE
TRYING TO SELL BARACK OBAMA'S
SEAT THE VOTE WAS 11-1 TO
CONVICT.
>> Jon: I WONDER WHICH JUROR
SIDED WITH BLAGOJEVICH?
OH, OH, WAIT.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T TRUST THE BIG KID WITH
THE FUNNY HAIR.
THAT'S IT, I GUESS.
>> THEY COULD NOT AGREE THAT WE
HAD PROVEN OR NOT PROVEN THOSE
COUNTS.
AS YOU KNOW, WE INTEND TO RETRY
THOSE CHARGES IN THE NEAR
FUTURE.
>> Jon: OH, FOR (bleep)
SAKE.
SO THE CHARGES THAT ORIGINALLY
MADE LINCOLN ROLL OVER IN HIS
GRAVE, THESE CHARGES, WHICH HAD
REANIMATED THE 150-YEAR-OLD
CORPORATION OF OUR MOST HONEST
PRESIDENT.
THIS ISN'T A MOVIE THIS IS AN
EPISODIC SERIES.
THIS IS LAW AND ORDER:  TIME
WAFTERS -- WASTERS UNITE.
BLAGOJEVICH DIDN'T GET AWAY
SCOTT FREE CONVICTED OF LYING TO
F.B.I.
THE KIND OF CRIME THAT WOULD
MAKE VAN VAN BUREN'S VICE
PRESIDENT SHIFT IN HIS GRAVE.
>> I WANT 20 EXPRESS MY
GRATITUDE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF THE JURY AND REMIND THE
PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS I DIDN'T LET
YOU DOWN.
THE JURY HAS SHOWN THAT I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.
>> Jon: EXCEPT FOR THE LYING
THING.
THE LIE TOGETHER F.B.I. THAT WAS
A SLAM DOWN.
WEAN A BONE HEAD PROSECUTOR AND
A BOUGHT AND PAID FOR JURY.
OOPS.
IF THERE'S ONE WINNER HERE IT'S
GOT TO BE BLAGOJEVICH'S LEGAL
TEAM.
THE ENTHUSIASM AND VIGOR THAT
THE STATE HAD FOR BLAGOJEVICH TO
WALK AWAY WITH ONLY ONE
CONVICTION.
HIS LAWYERS WHO APPARENTLY ARE
FROM THE FIRM RICKELS AND
PALPATINE.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY MUST HAVE WORKED REALLY
HARD FOR THAT VERDICT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WE DIDN'T PUT ON ANY DEFENSE,
NONE, ZERO, ZIP, NOTHING AND
THEY COULDN'T GET A CONVICTION.
>> Jon: I WAS DRUNK EVERY
SINGLE DAY OF THE TRIAL.
I DON'T SCREEN A LAW DEGREE.
I WASN'T EVEN AWAKE HALF THE
TIME.
I PAINTED EYEBALLS ON MY
EYELIDS.
THIS IS HOW LIT
