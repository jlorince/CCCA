PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, MAYOR BILL DeBLASIO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
HOW ARE YOU?
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
>> IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE.
>> Jon: THIS IS AN EXCITINGTIME FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLYMAYOR OF NEW YORK BUT ALSO
TAKING A MORE NATIONAL PLATFORMON THE ISSUE OF INCOME
INEQUALITY.
YOU FEEL THAT'S A REAL INJUSTICEAND I WANT TO ASK YOU BEFORE WE
GET INTO THAT, WHAT ALSO ABOUTHEIGHT INEQUALITY?
(LAUGHTER)WHAT ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE THE
1 PERCENTERS TOWER IN THEIRIVORY LEGS OVER THE PROLATARION
WHO ARE MAYBE CLOSER TO THERATS, THE GUTTER, THE SUBWAY?
HOW DO YOU REDISTRIBUTE?
>> I'M KIND OF DARWINIAN ON THISONE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)THIS INCOME INEQUALITY, YOU PUT
TOGETHER WHAT WAS CALLED ANPROGRESSIVE AGENDA TO ADDRESS
INCOME INEQUALITY.
BASIC TENT POST, WHAT CAN BEDONE.
>> RAISE OF WAGES AND BENEFITS.
$15 MINIMUM WAGE AS THE NORMIN AMERICA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: IS THERE SMALL
BUSINESSES ON THE MARKETS WHOMAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO
THAT?
IS THAT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ORIS THAT THE IDEA IT'S OKAY?
>> YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE LOCALVARIATIONS AND SOME EXCEPTIONS
BUT THE CORE POINT, MINIMUM-WAGEMEANS WHAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY
LIVE ON.
NEW YORK CITY TODAY MINIMUMWAGE, $8.75.
CAN YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY ONTHAT?
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK YOU CANLIVE ANYWHERE ON THAT.
ALSO THE LARGER CORPORATIONS,WALMARTS, THEY PAY VERY LITTLE
AND THE STATE AND FEDERALGOVERNMENT PICK UP THE TAB FOR
THE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BERENDERED WHO CAN'T LIVE.
FOOD STAMPS A, ET CETERA.
>> $15 MINIMUM WAGE, GIVE PEOPLEBASIC BENEFITS, PAID SICK DAYS,
PAID FAMILY LEAVE, THE KIND OFTHING WE SEE IN
INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS ALL OVERTHE WORLD, TAX THE WEALTHY.
>> Jon: OKAY, SO HERE'S ONEWE'LL THROW TO YOU.
1982 THE S.E.C. DEREGULATED THESTOCK OPTION BUYBACK FOR
CORPORATE INVESTMENT.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR REIN THAT IN, SOMUCH OF THE PROFITS -- WE HAVE
SOME STATISTICS -- THIS IS, BYTHE WAY, HARVARD BUSINESS
REVIEW, NO LEFTEST RAG -- ARESUGGESTING IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE
BUYBACK FEVER ON THE OPEN MARKETIT INADVERTENTLY INFLATES THE
STOCK MARKET, SO MUCH WAGE ISPULLED OUT, NOT REINVESTED INTO
THE COMPANY BUT GOES TO THEBOARDS AND STOCKHOLDERS, WOULD
YOU SUPPORT THAT TYPE OFPROGRAM?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IN THE PROGRESSIVE AGENDAAVAILABLE AT PROGRESSIVE
AGENDA..com, THE TAX ADVANTAGEIS FOR PERFORMANCE PAY, EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO WITHTHE STOCK.
C.E.O.s MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OFMONEY AND THEN IT'S TAX
SHELTERED CURRENTLY AND WHAT ITDOES, AS YOU INDICATE CIRCUITS
MAKES MATTERS WORSE BECAUSE THEMONEY DOESN'T GO BACK INTO THE
COMPANY, DOESN'T GO TO WORK ORINVESTMENTS IN THE ECONOMY,
BUILD THE ECONOMY, BUILD MOREJOBS, NO, IT GOES THE FEW.
HERE'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM IN THECOUNTRY.
THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH ANDPOWER IN THE HANDS OF A VERY FEW
IS ACTUALLY PULLING DOWN THECOUNTRY.
THE GREATEST INCOME DISPARITYSINCE BEFORE THE GREAT
DEPRESSION.
WE HAVE THE LAST 25 YEARS OR SOTHE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY
LITERALLY ADJUSTED FORINFLATION, LITERALLY HAS GONE
BACKWARDS ECONOMICALLY.
WE HAD A RECOVERY.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF GAINS THETOP 1%.
BUT WITH THESE BEING SO STARK,WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT, IS IT
PEOPLE DO NOT TRUST THAT WHENTHAT MONEY GOES BACK TO THE
GOVERNMENT THAT IT WILL BE SPENTWISELY?
THAT IT WON'T BE SQUANDERED?
DO THEY ALMOST PREFER IT BEINGSQUANDERED TO THE WEALTHY
C.E.O.s THAN TO THEGOVERNMENT?
HOW DO YOU REBUILD TRUST?
IT'S YOUR PLATFORM THAT THATMONEY IS UTILIZED CORRECTLY?
>> I THINK WHEN PEOPLE OF THISCOUNTRY SEE THEIR GOVERNMENT AND
ASSURE A DECENT STANDARD OFLIVING, $15 MINIMUM-WAGE, PAID
SICK LEAVE, PRE-K, WHICH SHOULDBE UNIVERSAL FOR FAMILIES IN
THIS COUNTRY. WHEN THEGOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING THOSE
KIND OF FUNDAMENTALS, THERE WILLBE AN INCREASE IN THE TRUST.
THE OTHER PART OF THE EQUATIONIS PEOPLE DIDN'T GET TO VOTE ON
A LOT OF THESE THINGS.
THESE WERE CHANGES IN THEPRIVATE SECTOR ECONOMY THAT
HAPPENED WITHOUT PUBLIC DEBATE.
IF I SAID TO THE AVERAGEAMERICAN, THE BUFFET RULE, HE
PAYS A LOWER TAX RATE THAN THESECRETARIES OR CLERKS IN HIS
OFFICE.
HE AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SAYTHAT'S WRONG.
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SAYS CLOSETHE HEDGE FUND LOOPHOLE.
WHY DOES A BILLIONAIRE HEDGEFUND MANAGER PAY LESS IN TAXES
THAN THE WOMAN WHO CLEANS HISBEACH HOUSE OR MAN WHO FLIES HIS
PRIVATE JET? THAT WOULD BE ACONSENSUS POSITION IN THIS
COUNTRY THEY SHOULDN'T BE
ALLOWED BUT WE DIDN'T GET TOVOTE ON THOSE.
>> Jon: THE OTHER SIDE PEOPLESAY THE FEDERAL AND CITY
GOVERNMENTS HAVE A TREMENDOUSAMOUNT OF MONEY, SPENT IT ALL IN
THE PAST 40 YEARS, YET WE STILLHAVE INTRACTABLE POVERTY AND
AREAS THAT SEEMINGLY WE CAN'TFIX WITH MONEY AND EVERYTHING
ELSE, HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THEMTHAT MORE INTERVENTION -- WHAT
DO WE DO WITH THOSE AREAS THATSEEM TO BE IMPERVIOUS TO THOSE
KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS?
>> HAVE THERE BEEN INSTANCESWHERE GOVERNMENT WAS
BUREAUCRATIC, INSUFFICIENT ORPOLITICS AND MONEY WASN'T SPENT
WELL?
OF COURSE.
BUT INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION ANDINFRASTRUCTURE WORKS.
IT HAS HISTORICALLY FOR THISCOUNTRY FROM THE END OF WORLD
WAR II THROUGH THE END OF THE1970s THERE WAS A MIDDLE CLASS
BECAUSE WE INVESTED.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT BREAKINGUP?
WE'VE CREATED NEIGHBORHOODSTHROUGH POLICIES, SEGREGATIONIST
POLICIES, ECONOMICPOLICIES, ET CETERA, THAT MADE
IT VERY DIFFICULT FORINTERVENTIONS TO PERMEATE THOSE
AREAS.
>> CORRECT.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT BREAKINGTHOSE UP SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T
FEEL SO TRAPPED?
>> ONE OF THE THINGS -- I THINKYOU'RE RIGHT.
ONE OF THE WAYS YOU DO IT YOUBUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
IN THIS CITY WE HAVE 200,000UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY NEW YORKCITY WILL BE A CITY FOR ALL
KINDS OF PEOPLE IF WE CREATEAFFORDABLE HOUSING.
IN THE PROCESS YOU BRINGDIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TOGETHER
IN THE SAME PLACE.
YOU START TO INTEGRATE.
THAT IS A BEGINNING OF A CHANGE.
>> Jon: IT WOULD BE NICE TOSEE 200,000 AFFORDABLE UNITS IN
WORK BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRINGTHE TOTAL 200,000.
(LAUGHTER)DONE YOUR BACKGROUND RESEARCH.
I AM IMPRESSED.
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL PUT THIS ON THE WE HAVEN'TSTICK AROUND, WE'LL TALK ABOUT
HOW YOU HAVE RUINED THE CITY.
AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DIESOON.
MAYOR BILL DeBLASIO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU.
