HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF
INDECISION 2010, MID-TERM
MADNESS.
IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT
REPUBLICANS IN THIS SEASON OF
VOTER ANGER AND CHANGE WILL
CLAIM THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
BUT WHAT OF THE SENATE, THE
WORLD'S MOST DELIBERATIVE BODY,
THE SAUCER THAT COOLS THE
HOUSE'S HOT TEA AND, OF COURSE,
KILLS MOST OF ITS LEGISLATION?
COULD THE DEMOCRATS ALSO LOSE
THE SENATE AS WELL AS THE
UNDERGROUND SECRET THIRD HOUSE
OF CONGRESS, WHERE... WHOOPS.
[LAUGHTER]
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.
SO HOW BAD IS IT FOR THE DEMS IN
THE SENATE?
>> THE MAGIC NUMBER IS TEN.
>> THERE ARE NO REPUBLICAN
SENATE SEATS REALLY IN DANGER,
BUT THERE ARE 13 DEMOCRATIC
SEATS IN DANGER.
>> Jon: 13 DEMOCRATIC SEATS
ARE IN DANGER.
SO THAT'S WHAT LASSIE WAS TRYING
TO TELL ME.
[LAUGHTER]
WOOF, WOOF, WOOF.
TROUBLE FOR THE DEMOCRATS AT THE
OLD MILL?
SHOULDN'T LASSIE BE...
[LAUGHTER]
WE ADDED THAT PICTURE AFTER
REHEARSAL, AND I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE, OH, SHOULD
HAVE.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL... SO HOW MUCH TROUBLE ARE
THE DEMOCRATS IN?
EVEN SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
HARRY REID, THAT EXCITING AND
CHARISMATIC LEADER, IS FACING A
TOUGH CHALLENGE FOR HIS SEAT IN
NEVADA.
>> REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR U.S.
SENATE SHARRON ANGLE.
>> SHE SUGGESTED ENTITLEMENT
PROGRAMS HAVE SPOILED OUR
CITIZENRY.
>> SHE SAYS GAY AMERICANS SHOULD
NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE CHILDREN.
>> IT MAY BE PART OF GOD'S PLAN
IF RAPE VICTIMS GET PREGNANT.
>> SHE DOES NOT BELIEVE BELIEVE
IN SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND
STATE.
>> SHE'S ADVOCATED WITHDRAWING
FROM THE UNITED NATIONS,
ABOLISHING THE E.P.A. AND MUCH
OF THE TAX CODE.
>> Jon: SHE WANTS TO ABOLISH
THE DEPARTMENT OF WEIGHTS AND
MEASURES.
FROM NOW ON JUST DO BUSINESS
LIKE THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
SHE WANTS TO DISSOLVE THE POST
OFFICE AND SEND ALL HER MESSAGES
THROUGH ANGELS.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO HERE'S THE THING: REID IS
TIED WITH HER.
WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING,
NEVADAIANS MUST REALLY HATE THE
E.P.A. OR HARRY REID.
SO IF REPUBLICANS REGAIN THE
SENATE, WHO COULD BE THE NEW
MAJORITY LEADER?
JIM DeMINT WOULD THEN BE
COUNTED ON TO REIN IN
IDEOLOGICAL MUSTANGS LIKE ANGLE.
>> HE'S TAKING A LOT OF HEAT FOR
SOME COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT GAYS
AND UNWED MOTHERS.
HE SAID ON SATURDAY THAT THEY
SHOULD BE BANNED FROM TEACHING.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, DID JIM
DeMINT JUST OUTLAW GLEE CLUBS?
[LAUGHTER]
NOT TO BE RUDE TO SOUTH
CAROLINA, BUT IF YOU RULE OUT
GAYS AND UNWED MOTHERS FROM
TEACHING YOU DOWN THERE, YOU'RE
REALLY ONLY LEFT WITH CREEPY
OUT-OF-TOUCH BASEMENT DWELLERS
WHO SEEM A LITTLE OFF, YOU KNOW,
DeMINT'S OPPONENT.
[LAUGHTER]
40 POINTS BEHIND.
IN THIS CLIMATE, IS THERE ANY
EXTREME A REPUBLICAN CAN GO TO
THAT WILL HURT THEIR CHANCES IN
NOVEMBER?
>> I'M NOT A WITCH.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I KNOW THIS GAME.
I KNOW THIS GAME.
I AM NOT A CENATUR.
YOUR TURN.
>> I'M IN THE A WITCH.
I'M NOTHING YOU'VE HEARD.
I'M YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU'RE ME?
BECAUSE I DON'T RECALL THE LAST
TIME I HAD TO DENY I WAS A
WITCH.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S CHRISTIE O'DONNELL, THE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR
IN DELAWARE.
SHE'S CURRENTLY ABOUT 16 POINTS
DOWN IN THE POLLS, PROBABLY
BECAUSE SHE EXHIBITS THE TYPE OF
JUDGMENT THAT HAS HER DENYING
SHE IS A WITCH WHILE STANDING IN
FRONT OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE
STEAM FROM A BUBBLING CAULDRON.
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, WHERE WE GOING TO SHOOT
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL'S COMMERCIAL
WHERE SHE DENIES A WITCH?
HEY, ELVIRA'S SET IS AVAILABLE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S A ME -- PECULIAR ELECTION
SEASON WHERE ONCE AGAIN
AMERICANS ARE BEING TOLD JUST
HOW DIVIDED WE ARE FROM A
NATION, AND HOW WAS MUST PICK
FROM ONE OF TWO DOCTRINE
CHOICES.
ASHJIAN EXPLORES THE O'DONNELL
RACE WHICH EPITOMIZES THE
CONFLICT.
>> MORE THAN ANY STATE DELAWARE
HAS BECOME A MICROCOSM OF THE
WAY WE ARE POLITICALLY.
>> CHRISTINE O'DONNELL, IS SHE A
WITCH?
>> DEMOCRATS ARE COMING OUT OF
THE WOODWORK TO SUPPORT
DELAWARE'S MARXIST.
>> SHE ONCE SAID SHE DABBLED IN
WITCHCRAFT.
>> HOW DID WE REACH A POINT
WHERE EVERYTHING IS REDUCED TO A
POLITICAL CARICATURE?
IN DELAWARE, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
THAT WAY, ACCORDING TO
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR JASON
MIKEOFF.
>> CHRISTINE O'DONNELL WON THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY PRIMARILY
BECAUSE OF THE SOUTH.
VOTERS IN THE SOUTH ARE MUCH
MORE CONSERVATIVE, AGRARIAN.
THEY TEND TO BE MORE RELIGIOUS.
THEY TEND TO BE WHITE.
>> THE SOUTH.
YOU MEAN PEOPLE COMING UP FROM
GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA TO
VOTE?
>> NO, THE SOUTH IS DELAWARE.
>> WHEN YOU SAY THERE'S A SOUTH
IN DELAWARE...
>> YEAH?
>> DELAWARE?
>> DELAWARE.
>> IS IT REALLY CALLED SOUTH, OR
IS IT JUST CALLED LIKE OVER
THERE?
WAS THE NORTH REALLY FILLED WITH
MONEYED LIBERAL ELITISTS AND THE
SOUTH WITH GOD-FEARING PATRIOTS?
I'D SOMEHOW HAVE TO TRAVEL THE
LENGTH OF THE STATE AND... WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, TOO FAR.
LOOP BACK AROUND.
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
>> WE HAVE THE UNIVERSITY, AND
WE HAVE BIG INDUSTRIAL PLACES.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PEOPLE
FROM DOWN SOUTH?
>> I THINK OF THE SOUTH, I THINK
OF HILLBILLY, REDNECK, IF YOU
WILL.
>> AND WHAT ARE YOU?
>> I CONSIDER MYSELF A CIVILIZED
HUMAN BEING.
>> REALLY?
>> YEAH.
>> WAS SOUTHERN DELAWARE REALLY
SUCH A BACKWATER?
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND
OUT, SO I HEADED DOWN TO DIXIE
TO --
>> YOU'VE ARRIVED AT YOUR
DESTINATION.
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WE JUST WENT LIKE FIVE FEET.
>> OUR VALUES ARE DEFINITELY
MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THEY ARE
UP NORTH.
>> THEY DON'T LIKE NORTHERNERS
DOWN HERE DOWN HERE SO MUCH.
>> NO?
>> NO, NO, THEY THINK THEY'RE
INVADING THEIR SACRED LAND DOWN
HERE.
>> IT'S ONLY 40 MINUTES AWAY,
BUT YOU'D THINK YOU WENT TO
ARKANSAS OR ALABAMA.
>> IT'S A DIFFERENT BREED OF
PEOPLE UP THERE.
>> DOWN SOUTH THEY DON'T HAVE
UNIVERSITIES OR THEATERS OR
PLAYHOUSES.
>> NO, THEY DON'T.
WHILE THE SOUTH HAS ONLY TWO
MUSEUMS AND A SATELLITE CAMPUS
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,
THE NORTH BOASTS THREE MUSEUMS
AND THE MAIN CAMPUS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE.
IT'S AS IF THEY'RE TWO
COMPLETELY SEPARATE STATES.
>> DOWN HERE WE GO TO THE FLEA
MARKETS.
>> WHAT DO THEY DO?
>> THEY GO TO THE FLEA MALLS.
>> THE FLEA MALLS?
>> THE FLEA MALLS.
>> DOWN HERE IT'S THE FLEA
MARKET.
>> THE FLEA MARKET.
>> AND AS I DISCOVERED, THAT'S
NOT THE ONLY RADICAL DIFFERENCE.
I'M GOING TO GET A CHEF SALAD.
>> OKAY.
>> WHAT DO YOU CALL A
CHEESESTEAK DOWN HERE?
>> CHEESESTEAK.
>> OH, YOU CALL IT WHAT?
>> CHEESESTEAK.
>> A CHEESESTEAK?
BECAUSE UP NORTH THEY CALL IT A
CHEESESTEAK.
>> OH.
OKAY.
WE CALL IT A CHEESESTEAK.
>> A CHEESESTEAK.
A CHEESESTEAK.
>> YES.
>> BECAUSE WE CALL IT A
CHEESESTEAK.
WE DON'T CALL IT A CHEEEEZ
STEAK.
WE CALL IT A CHEESE STEAK.
>> WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
>> CHEEESE STEAK.
>> WE CALL IT A CHEESESTEAK.
>> OKAY.
>> CLEARLY THE BATTLELINES IN
THE STATE OF DELAWARE HAVE BEEN
DRAWN, YET AS OFTEN THE CASE,
THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER THE MOST
AREN'T THOSE IN THE NORTH OR THE
SOUTH, BUT THOSE ON THE BORDER.
>> I TRY NOT TO, YOU KNOW, GET
IN THE BATTLE OF NORTH AND
SOUTH, BUT I GOT SOME FAMILY
THAT LIVES UP NORTH HERE, AND
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT PACE
DOWN HERE.
>> YOU LIVE ON THE BORDER, BUT
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KIND OF
IDENTIFY WITH THE SOUTH?
>> YEAH, YEAH, I WOULD SAY SO.
>> LOOKING AT YOU, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD BE REDNECK, BE A
REDNECK, AND IF YOU STAND OVER
HERE, NOW YOU'RE A DOUCHEBAG
HIPSTER.
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
>> FROM THE NORTH.
>> FROM THE NORTH, RIGHT?
IT'S UNCLEAR IF EITHER CANDIDATE
CAN UNITE THIS WAR-TORN STATE,
AND CERTAINLY THERE'S ONE THING
THAT WILL NEVER BE RESOLVED.
A CHEESE STEAK?
>> YEAH.
>> SO YOU DON'T CALL IT A
CHEESESTEAK?
>> IT'S A CHEESESTEAK.
>> YOU CALL IT A CHEESESTEAK?
>> YES.
>> BECAUSE WE CALL IT A CHEESE
STEAK.
