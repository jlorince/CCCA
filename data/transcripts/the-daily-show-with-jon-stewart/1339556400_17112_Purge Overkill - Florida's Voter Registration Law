(LAUGHTER) A VOTER PURGE WEIGHTED AGAINST HISPANIC VOTERS, CLOSING THE POLLS ON A DAY MANY AFRICAN
AMERICAN VOTERS CAST THEIR BALLOTS.
NICE TRY, GOVERNOR!
AND TALLER OF THE TWO TWIN PEAKS BACKWARDS TALKING GUYS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT, GOVERNOR, YOU HEARD ME!
YOU MILDLY RESEMBLE CHARACTER ACTOR CAROL FRANKEN.
BOOM!
IT'S THAT EASY!
ANYWAY YOUR LITTLE PLAN DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU FORGOT TO SUPPRESS ANOTHER POWERFUL INFLUX
VOTERS-- THE NEWLY REGISTERED.
>> FLORIDA'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SIGNED A NEW LAW LAST
YEAR, ANYONE WHO REGISTERS VOTERS IN THE STATE HAVE TO HAND IN ALL COMPLETED FORMS NO LATER
THAN 48 HOURS TO THE MINUTE AFTER THE APPLICANTS HAVE ORIGINALLY FILLED THEM OUT.
>> Jon: IS THAT TOUR FROM LAW NECESSARY?
HOW WOULD IT EVEN WORK?
WE SENT JOHN OLIVER TOï¿½ï¿½ FLORIDA TO INVESTIGATE.
>> MOST RATIONAL PEOPLE VIEW FLORIDA'S NEW TOUR FROM VOTER REGISTRATION LAW AS A
COMMON-SENSED BULWARK AGAINST FRAUD.
BUT SOME CRACKPOTS LIKE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS PRESIDENT DIEDRE McNABB FAIL TO SEE HOW
GREAT IT IS.
>> THIS TOUR FROM TIMELINE I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER.
OUR VOLUNTEERS DON'T HAVE TIME TO RUN DOWN TO THEIR SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS OFFICE EVERY TIME
WE GET VOTER REGISTRATIONS.
>> BUT YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH THOSE FORMS FOR LONGER THAN 48 HOURS.
>> I THINK OUR RECORD OF 72 YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS,
BLEMISH-FREE RECORD SHOWS THAT WE ARE TRUSTWORTHY.
>> WELL, 72 YEARS OF NOT GETTING CAUGHT AND FOR THAT I'LL CONGRATULATE YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THANK YOU.
>> AND BECAUSE OF THIS LAW,
THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION GROUPS LIKE THE LEAGUE HAVE LEFT FLORIDA AND NEW VOTER
REGISTRATIONS ARE DOWN ALMOST 20%.
BUT THEï¿½ï¿½g THIS IS A NECESSARY SACRIFICE TO PROTECT THE SANTTY OF OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS.
>> IT'S A BALANCE.
WE WANT TO MAKE IT'S EASY TO VOTE AND HARD TO CHEAT.
I THINK THIS WILL HELP IN THAT EFFORT.
>> SO YOU WANT TO INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT BYPASSING THIS LAW EVEN
THOUGH IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE REGISTERING TO VOTE.
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.
IT JUST DOES.
(LAUGHTER) SFRNLT WELL, THE POINT IS ANY AMOUNT OF VOTER FRAUD IS TOO MUCH.
>> EXACTLY!
AND SACRIFICING 20% OF NEWyKï¿½ VOTER PARTICIPATION IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE HORRORS OF VOTER
FRAUD WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE,
HAPPENS AT A TERRIFYING RATE OF .0004%!
(LAUGHTER)
>> ANY GROUP THAT COMES UP WITH A NUMBER THAT SPECIFIC IS BLOWING SMOKE THROUGH THEIR ASS.
>> RIGHT.
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF SPECIFIC NUMBERS.
>> LOOK, THE DETECTED VOTER FRAUD THAT YOU PROSECUTE AND PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR MAY BE ONE NUMBER.
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VOTER FRAUD OUT THERE YOU CAN NEVER CATCH
BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO DO!
>> SO VOTER FRAUD STATISTICS ARE LIMITED ONLY AS MUCH AS YOUR IMAGINATION.
(LAUGHTER) AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CATCH FRAUD-- LIKE ELECTIONS
SUPERVISOR ANN McFALL COULDN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS LAW IN PLACE.
>> THE LAW DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
I DON'T SEE THE FRAUD IN VOTER REGISTRATION.
IT JUST ISN'T HAPPENING.
>> BUT, ANNE, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT VOTER FRAUD THAT HAS HAPPENED.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VOTER FRAUD THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.
>> WHERE DID YOU GET THESE IDEAS?
>> JOHN FUND.
>> WHO?
>> HAVING A SHORT WINDOW SO YOU HAVE TO TURN IN THE FORM QUICKLY LESSEN IT IS CHANCE FOR MISCHIEF.
>> RIGHT.
MISCHIEF.
>> THESE ARE GOVERNMENT FORMS.
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT THEM FLOATING OUT THERE FOR TOO LONG.
>> IF YOU GIVE THEM ANYTHING LONGER THAN 48 HOURS THEY WILL GO ON A HELL-BOUND BENDER THAT
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW.
BUT THE LONGER YOU DON'T TURN SOMETHING IN THE MORE YOU JUST MISPLACE IT ACCIDENTALLY.
YOU DON'T TURN SOME OF THEM IN IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.
THERE'S A DANGER.
THEY COULD MISUSE THAT INFORMATION.
>> WELL, THAT 48 HOURS NOW SEEMS FAR TOO LONG.
WHAT ABOUT 12 HOURS?
SURE THEY'S MUCH SAFER.
>> THE POINT IS THEY MADE IT 48 HOURS.
THAT
>> THAT'S THE PERFECT BALANCE OF HOURS.
>> YES.
>> HE WAS RIGHT.
FLORIDA LAWMAKERS HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO STOP ALL THIS POST-TOUR FROM MISCHIEF.
>> WHAT!
>> IT'S A FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION.
>> EXACTLY!
AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY IMAGINATION.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
IMAGINE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF CASES OF VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ CAN YOU SEE IT?
>> NO.
>> SO YOU DON'T SEE A GOAT WALKING OFF WITH A VOTER REGISTRATION FORM?
>> NO, NOT IN THIS STATE.
>> BUT, ANNE, NO OFFENSE, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.
>> THAT SHOWS YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR HOME WORK.
I'M A REPUBLICAN.
>> REGARDLESS, THE FRAUD DENIERS IN THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE MANAGED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND
THIS TOUR FROM RULE, LEAVING GROUPS LIKE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS FREE TO GET INTO
HYPOTHETICAL MISCHIR LIKE THIS.
THIS HASN'T HAPPENED AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AND THAT IS WHY IT MUST BE STOPPED.
