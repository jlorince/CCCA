>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, I AMRANDY WEBER...
[LAUGHTER]YOU KNOW, THE STRENGTH OF OUR
MILITARY IS THE BRAVE MEN ANDWOMEN WHO SERVE IN IT.
THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO MAKETHE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE TO DEFEND
THEIR COUNTRY, AND BLACK WOMENHAVE HAIR.
NOW, THOSE TWO THINGS MAY NOTSEEM CONNECTED TO YOU, BUT
JESSICA WILLIAMS EXPLAINS.
>> THE U.S. ARMY RECENTLYRELEASED A NEW SET OF UNIFORM
REGULATIONS, AR670-1, WHICH,AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT
OPTIONS FOR BLACK WOMEN'SHAIRSTYLES, PROMPTING ONE BLACK
SERVICE WOMAN TO RESPOND, OH,NO, THEY DIDN'T, IN THE FORM OF
A WHITEHOUSE.GOV PETITION WHICHRECEIVED OVER 17,000 SIGNATURES.
SERGEANT JASMINE JACOBS.
>> THE NEW REGULATIONS AREBASICALLY STATING THAT THE
CURRENT HAIRSTYLES FOR BLACKFEMALES ARE NOW UNAUTHORIZED,
SUCH AS TWO-STRAND TWIST, NEATLYKEPT DREADLOCKS, FLAT TWIST AND
BASICALLY ALMOST ANY NATURALHAIRSTYLE.
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
OKAY. OKAY. WAIT.
WE'RE THROWING AROUND A LOT OFWORDS HERE.
LET'S TAKE A SECOND AND LET THEWHITE PEOPLE CATCH UP.
[LAUGHTER]
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY'RENEVER GOING TO CATCH UP.
WHITE PEOPLE, THESE ARE THEHAIRSTYLES THE ARMY HAS BANNED.
>> TWO-STRAND TWIST.
>> TWISTS ARE JUST TWISTED HAIR.
>> NEATLY KEPT DREADLOCKS.
>> THAT'S WHEN BLACK HAIR LOCKSTOGETHER.
>> BASICALLY ALMOST ANY NATURALHAIRSTYLE.
>> NATURAL MEANS HOW OUR HAIRNATURALLY GROWS, CRAZY, RIGHT?
AND THESE ARE THE INCREDIBLYDIFFICULT HAIRSTYLES THE ARMY
ALLOWS, CHEMICALLY STRAIGHTENEDHAIR THAT BURNS LIKE HELL,
WEAVES THAT ARE SEWN ONTO YOURHEAD, MICROBRAIDS THAT TAKE
FOREVER, WIGS, YEAH, WIGS, ANDCORN ROWS.
PSHT, I'VE SEEN YOU GUYSAT MYRTLE BEACH.
YOU KNOW WHAT CORN ROWS ARE.
BASICALLY THE ONLY HAIRSTYLESTHE ARMY ALLOWS COST A TON OF
MONEY AND PUT YOUR ASS IN ASALON FOR HOURS.
NOW THAT THE WHITE PEOPLE ARECAUGHT UP, LET'S CONTINUE.
>> WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THEREGULATIONS, I DEFINITELY WAS IN
A PANIC. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IWAS GOING TO DO WITH MY HAIR.
>> RIGHT. YOU WERE PROBABLYSTRESSED BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANT
TO LOOK FLY, RIGHT?
>> WELL, NO. IT DOESN'T HAVEANYTHING TO DO WITH LOOKING FLY,
ACTUALLY. YOU HAVE TO ACCOMPLISHYOUR MISSION. THE HAIRSTYLES
THAT WE'RE LEFT WITH ARECOSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING
AND, HONESTLY, GET IN THE WAY OFYOU DOING YOUR JOB PROPERLY.
>> BUT SOME PEOPLE IN THEMILITARY THINK SERGEANT JACOBS
HAS STEPPED OUT OF LINE, LIKEFORMER LIEUTENANT COMMANDER
THOMAS CHEEVER. AND HE'S GOTSOME MUCH-NEED ADVICE FOR
BLACK SERVICE WOMEN.
>> SOLDIER, IT'S TIME TO SUCK ITUP.
THEY'RE CALLED UNIFORMREGULATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF
MAKING PEOPLE LOOK UNIFORM.
>> OF COURSE, EVERYONE IN THEARMY SHOULD LOOK THE
SAME, WHETHER YOU LOOK LIKE, TOTAKE TWO TOTALLY RANDOM
EXAMPLES, WILFORD BRIMLEY ORBEYONCE'S PRETTIER SISTER.
>> BUT ALSO, THERE ARE SAFETYISSUES IN THAT WHETHER IT BE
KEVLAR HELMETS, WHETHER IT BE AGAS MASK, WHETHER IT BE AN
OXYGEN MASK FOR AN AVIATOR ANDTHINGS OF THAT NATURE, MUST FIT
PROPERLY.
>> SO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUTON A GAS MASK?
>> YES.>> LIKE THIS?
>> YES.
>> AND YOU NEED TO HAVE ANAPPROVED HAIRSTYLE?
>> CORRECT.
>> LIKE A WIG, LIKE THIS?
WELL, LET'S TRY TO PUT THIS ONAND THIS ON RIGHT NOW AND SEE
HOW IT FEELS.
GO AHEAD.
>> PRESUMABLY THE WIG WOULDALREADY BE ON.
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S MINUS ONEDEMERIT.
MEETING A WHITE STANDARD OFBEAUTY CAN GIVE YOU A THREE
STOOGES STANDARD OF COMBATREADINESS.
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?>> IT FEELS TERRIBLE.
>> NOW, WAS THAT BATTLE READYHAIR?
>> NO.
>> SO WHY CHANGE THE REGULATIONSNOW?
IT'S FUNNY, BACK WHEN THE ARMYWAS FIGHTING TWO WARS, THEY
NEEDED BLACK WOMEN.
BUT NOW THEY CAN SUDDENTLYAFFORD TO BE A LITTLE PICKIER.
>> THESE NEW REGULATIONS COULDDEFINITELY DETER BLACK FEMALES
FROM JOINING THE MILITARYBECAUSE IT'S WAS LIKE, YOU'RE
GOOD ENOUGH TO GO TO IRAQ AND,YOU KNOW, LIKE RISK YOUR LIFE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGHTO WEAR YOUR HAIR THE WAY
IT NATURALLY GROWS OUT OF YOURHAIR.
>> WELL, WHAT IF THE ARMYRECOGNIZED HOW PAINFUL HAIR
RELAXERS ARE AND THEN REWARDEDYOU WITH A MEDAL? GREAT HAIR,
SERGEANT JAMES. WE'RE AWARDINGYOU WITH A PURPLE SCALP?
>> UM, I DON'T WANT A PURPLESCALP.
I THINK THEY REALLY NEED TOEDUCATE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE
COMPLEXITY OF BLACK HAIR.
THEY'RE NOT AWARE ANDPROBABLY DIDN'T FEEL A NEED TO
GO FIND OUT ABOUT IT.
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?SOMEONE TO EDUCATE AND INSPIRE
NOT JUST THE MILITARY BUT THEENTIRE COUNTRY.
SOMEONE WHO CAN RAISE AWARENESS.
>> RIGHT.
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I'VE BEENTRYING DO WITH MY PETITION.
>> NO, NOT YOU, SOMEBODY WITHMAGNETIC PERSONALITY, A TALENTED
TV PERSON.
LUCKILY I KNEW JUST THE PERSON.
IT WAS GO TIME.
COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TOLIVE. IN AN ARMY
WITHOUT A LOT OF PISSED-OFFBLACK LADIES. LET'S GO.
LET'S COMMENCE WITH OPERATIONBLACK HAIR.
OILS, SERUMS, POMADES, THESEARE TOOLS OF THE TRADE,
THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW.
A RECON MISSION TO UNCOVER JUSTWHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE BLACK HAIR
ARMY READY.
>> I NEED DO YOU TALK TO HIMABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS
AND DON'T SAY IT'S BECAUSE YOUHAVE A NATIVE AMERICAN GRANDMA.
HOT COMB. KNOW IT.
RESPECT IT.
>> WHAT THIS IS, IT'S EXTENSION,HAIR EXTENSIONS.
>> DOES IT HURT?
>> DOES IT HURT?
>> YEAH, YEAH, IT HURTS.
>> THIS IS RELAXER.
IT WILL LAY YOUR [BLEEPED] OUT.
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT HERE ANDYOU'RE GOING TO WATCH HER GET
HER BRAIDS DONE. IT'S GOING TOTAKE FOUR HOURS.
OKAY.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
EYES ON TARGET.
THIS ISN'T A 20-MINUTETACTICAL CREWCUT.
THIS IS BOOTS ON THE GROUND,HANDS IN THE HAIR, ALL DAMN DAY.
BUT WAS THIS WORKING?
WHAT IS THIS?
>> RELAXER.
>> WHAT DOES IT DO?>> LAY YOUR [BLEEPED] OUT.
>> YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME TODAY.
>> YES, MA'AM.
I'M WEARING A BLIND FOLD, NOTEARPLUGS.
PLEASE.
>> MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
ONE WHITE GUY IS PROBABLYCONVINCED.
BUT I COULDN'T STOP THERE.
I HAD TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE OFINSPIRATION TO THE ENTIRE
NATION.
I HAVE A WEAVE.
I HAVE A WEAVE THAT WE BE JUDGENOT BY WHAT GROWS OUT OF OUR
HEAD BUT BY THE CONTENTS WITHINIT.
I HAVE BEEN TO THE BEAUTY SHOP.
DAMN, YOU STILL NOT DONE WITHTHEM BRAIDS?
[BLEEPED].
