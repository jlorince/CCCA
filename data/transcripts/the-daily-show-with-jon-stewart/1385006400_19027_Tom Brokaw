[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]I WAS STRUCK WATCHING SOME OF
THE SPECIAL AT HOW EMOTIONAL ALOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
AROUND THE SCENE OF IT.
YOU TALKED TO NOT JUST THE WIDOWOF LIKE THE POLICE OFFICER THAT
WAS KILLED BUT THE SURGEON THATWAS IN -- THE 31-YEAR-OLD
SURGEON.
>> IT WAS A DEFINING MOMENTIN THE LIVES OF A LOT OF
PEOPLE, JON.
I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS FORMORE THAN A YEAR.
I WAS 20 WHEN HE WAS ELECTED.
IT WAS A BIG MOMENT IN MY LIFEBECAUSE IT CHANGED POLITICS IN
THIS COUNTRY.
IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THIS WASTHE FIRST PRESIDENT WE ALL
SHARED BECAUSE OF TELEVISION.
HE WAS IN EVERYONE'S HOME EVERYNIGHT.
WE HAD NOT HAD THAT PHENOMENONBEFORE
HE WAS SO CHARISMATIC.
BY THAT STAGE OF HIS PRESIDENCYHIS NUMBERS WERE GOING UP.
HE HAD BECOME POPULAR AGAINAFTER THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS.
IT WAS A REAL TRANSITION IN HOWWE PERCEIVED POLITICANS AND THE
CONNECTION WE FELT TO THEM.
IT WAS SUCH A VIOLENT ENDING. IWAS A REPORTER IN OMAHA AND I
REMEMBER READING IT ON THE AIR.
I HAD TWO PARTS OF MY MINDWORKING PERSONAL AND ALSO
THINKING THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN INTHIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: IT USHERED IN AN ERAOF VIOLENCE AND UPHEAVEL BUT IT
WAS THE IGNITION POINT FOR THAT.
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO GO ALL THEWAY BACK TO -- I GUESS YOU WOULD
GO -- WHO WAS THE LAST PRESIDENTTO HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED FROM
THAT POINT McKINLEY.
>> YES.
>> Jon: NOBODY -->> SHOTS WERE FIRED AT
ROOSEVELT.
TRUMAN, THE PUERTO RICANNATIONALS CAME UP AND GOT INTO
THE -- THIS GUY SEEMED TO USWATCHING HIM AT THAT TIME LIKE
HE WAS INVULNERABLE.
HE WAS SO GREAT LOOKING.
THE PRESIDENCY WAS GOING WELL.
JACKIE SITTING BESIDE HIM.
SUDDENLY RIFLE SHOTS AND AMERICACHANGED PROFOUNDLY.
WE WENT BACK TO THE KIND OFOLDER -- LYNDON JOHNSON TAKING
THE OVAL OFFICE AND THE KENNEDYADMINISTRATION WAS OVER.
>> Jon: YOU REMEMBER THETRANSFORMATION THAT BOBBY
KENNEDY UNDERWENT AFTER THATASSASSINATION.
I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN BOBBYKENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING
WERE ASSASSINATED.
I REMEMBER THOSE EVENTS VIVIDLY.
THE DEFINING MOMENTS I REMEMBERAS A KID AND THERE WAS TAUNTING
IN THERE BUT MOSTLY THEASSASSINATIONS.
>> I THINK NO ONE MADE A MOREIMPRESSIVE TRANSITION
MIDSTREAM THAN BOBBY KENNEDY.
HE WAS JACK KENNEDY'S ENFORCER,HIS CLOSEST COUNSELOR, A TOUGH
GUY BEHIND THE SCENES.
IT WAS ALWAYS BOBBY PUTTING HISFINGER IN SOMEBODY'S CHEST.
OBVIOUSLY IN 1968 BECAUSE OF WARAND CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND
SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT COULDYOU SEE DEVELOP ON THE FLY
ALMOST HE BECAME THE MOSTINTERESTING POLITICIAN OF
THAT ERA.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU ARE TALKINGTO PEOPLE WHO WERE DOWN THERE,
AS YOU SPEAK TO THEM, ARE THEIRMEMORIES DO THEY FEEL PERSONAL
OR ALMOST A NARRATIVE CREATEDFROM THE DAY, FROM ALL THE
EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCEDFROM THAT DAY?
IS IT DIFFICULT TO SEPARATETHOSE THINGS?
>> I THINK FOR THEM IT'S VERYPERSONAL.
THEY RESERVED A PARTOF THEIR MEMORY BANK
AND EMOTION FROM THAT DAY.
EMJOHN BREWER YEAR WHO YOU SAWTHERE
HE DID MAKE IT POSSIBLE TOGET OSWALD EARLY BECAUSE HE
FOLLOWED HIM TO THEMOVIE THEATER.
HE CHANGED HIS LIFE.
HE GOT OUT OF DALLAS, WENT INTHE NAVY FOR A WHILE.
THIT'S JUST BEEN RECENTLY THATHE'S BEEN ABLE TO COPE AGAIN
WITHTHE IDEA OF JOHN BREWER THAT
FOUND OSWALD AND HE COULD HAVE ALIFE.
NFL FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHODIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ON THAT
SUNDAY BUT THEY WERE TOLD TO.
>> Jon: PEOPLE FORGET, TOO,THE REACTION TO DALLAS IN
GENERAL WAS HARSH.
THE CITY ITSELF IT'S ATHLETICTEAMS IT'S PEOPLE.
PEOPLE WERE -- THEY DIDN'T KNOWWHERE TO PUT THEIR ANGER AND
DISTRESS AND THEY DIRECTED ITSOMETHING AT A CITY.
>> IT TURNS OUT DALLAS HADNOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
LEE HARVEY OSWALD HAD A BROTHERTHERE.
>> Jon: ONE OF THE GUYSOBVIOUSLY.
>> WE DO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL.
>> Jon: YOU DEAL WITH THECONSPIRACY THEORIES.
WHEN THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITHTHE WIDOW OF THE COP THAT OSWALD
KILLED, HOW DO THEY RECONCILETHAT?
>> THERE'S A CIRCUS OFCONSPIRACY, PEOPLE WITH CARD
TABLES TELLING YOU THE VIDEOTAPES, PICTURES OF THE AUTOPSY
OR HIM ON THE EXAMINATION TABLEI SAY THERE WERE SIX EYE
WITNESSES THAT SAW HIM SHOT.
THEY SAY YEAH BUT HE HAD AN AUTOMATIC AND IT WAS A
REVOLVER AND ALMOST NONE OF ITADDS UP IN THAT CASE.
I'M PERSUADED IT WAS OSWALD.
