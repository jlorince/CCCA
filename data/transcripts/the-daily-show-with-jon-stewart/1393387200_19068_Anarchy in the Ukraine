[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE
DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THE PROGRAM TONIGHT WILL BEEXCEPTIONAL.
MY GUEST TONIGHT MICHIO KAKU.
HE IS A THEORETICAL QUANTUMPHYSICIST POSTULATING ON THE
NEUROSCIENCES.
I WILL ASK HIM TO GIVE ME HISLUNCH MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S BEGIN IN THE UKRAINE. ACOUNTRY PRECARIOUSLY BALANCEDBETWEEN RUSSIAN AND EUROPEANINFLUENCES.
A BARRIER TWIXT EAST ANDWEST, A THIN BORSCHT WALL IF YOU
WILL SEPARATING THE KREMLIN'SDOMINANT INFLUENCE, REPRESENTEDHERE BY THE GIANTANIMATRONIC CRYING
BEAR, A CLASSIC ICON OF RUSSIANPOWER AND EUROPEAN INFLUENCE
REPRESENTED BY AN (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]WHO THINKS HIS TINY COFFEE IS
SO MUCH BETTER THAN  ANYBODYELSE'S COFFEE.
IF IT WAS SO GREAT, WHY DON'TYOU DRINK MORE OF IT?
[LAUGHTER]>> ANYWAY MY POINT IS UKRAINE
HAS DESCENDED TO CHAOS.
>> THE TROUBLE BEGAN IN NOVEMBERWHEN PRESIDENT YANUKOVYCHREJECTED AN ECONOMIC DEAL WITH
THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FAVOR OFCLOSER TIES WITH RUSSIA.
THE COUNTRY SPLIT IN TWO UNTILDEMONSTRATORS FINALLY CALLED FOR
PRESIDENT YANUKOVYCH TO STEPDOWN.
>> RIOT POLICE AND PROTESTERSCLASHED AGAIN IN KIEV'S
INDEPENDENCE SQUARE.
>> Jon: FIRST THING I'M GOINGTO DO WHEN I'M A DICTATOR, I'M
GOING GET RID OF ALL THESE(bleep) SQUARES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS FORDICTATORS IN SQUARES.
[LAUGHTER]YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT UPRISINGS
IN TAHIR TRIANGLE OR TIANNANMENRHOMBUS.
YOU NEVER HEAR THAT.
IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION, ACOMPLICATED SITUATION.
THERE ARE HISTORIC DIVISIONSAMONGST WEST LEANING UKRAINIANS
AND THOSE WHO STILL CONSIDERTHEMSELVES RUSSIAN.
THERE'S FALLOUT FROM UKRAINE'S2004 ORANGE REVOLUTION.
THERE'S PARALLELS HERE WITH THEARAB SPRING OR TO PUT ALL THISIN
PARLANCE OUR MEDIA CANUNDERSTAND.
>> I WONDER HOW IT WILL PLAY IN2014 OR EVEN IN 2016.
>> Jon: YES.
THE CRUCIAL QUESTION ASUKRAINIANS BRAVELY TAKE TO THE
STREETS AS ALWAYS, WHAT DOES ITMEAN FOR OUR MID TERMS OR
PERHAPS OUR PRESIDENTIALELECTION?
AFTER ALL UKRAINE DOES RANK ASAN ISSUE VOTERS CARE ABOUT JUST
UNDER EQUAL RIGHTS FORGHOSTS AND SHOULD
EVOLUTION BE TAUGHT IN POOLS.
I'M SURE UKRAINE IS EQUALLY ASFIXATED ON AMERICAN POLITICS.
>> I BELIEVE THIS UPRISING WILLHELP CHRISTIE.
WE'VE DONE IT TO DISTRACTAMERICANS FROM BRIDGEGATE. THISWILL HELP CHRISTIE IN THE IOWACAUCASIAN.
