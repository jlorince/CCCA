I STAND CORRECTED.
PROBLEM SOLVED.
(LAUGHTER) THERE IS ONE AREA OF THIS MESS THAT I THINK IS ALSO WORTHY OF COMMENT.
AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW EGG SYSTEM "WHAT STORY DOES A GUY HAVE TO BLOW TO GET IN
TROUBLE WITH ABC?" (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WHEN THESE TYPES OF STORIES OCCUR NEWS
ORGANIZATIONS ARE SCRAMBLING TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE EVENT.
>> I WANT TO GO TO BRIAN ROSS WHO'S BEEN INVESTIGATING THE BACKGROUND OF JIM HOLMES.
YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT.
>> Jon: OOH!
THAT'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ANCHORING THE COVERAGE, THROWING TO HIS COLLEAGUE BRIAN ROSS WHO
FOUND SOMETHING... I BELIEVE GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS USED THE PHRASE "THAT MIGHT BE
SIGNIFICANT." GO!
>> THERE'S A JIM HOLMES IN THE AURORA TEA PARTY SITE TALKING
ABOUT HIM JOINING THE TEA PARTY LAST YEAR.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE SAME JIM HOLMES, BUT IT'S A JIM HOLMES OF ROERZ, COLORADO.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY CORRECT RESPONSE TO THAT STATEMENT IS BRIAN, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
HAD SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT!
(LAUGHTER) NOT "HEY, GEORGE, LET ME INTERRUPT YOU, I PUT THE NAME JAMES HOLMES INTO MY SEARCH
ENGINE AND HIT THE "I'M FEELING LAZY BUTTON." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
OF COURSE STEPHANOPOULOS IS IN THE MIDDLE... STEPHANOPOULOS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING A LOT OF
THINGS AND I'M ASSUMING HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT BRIAN ROSS CHECKED OUT THIS (BLEEP)
HE'S SAYING ON AIR BEFORE SAYING IT.
BECAUSE BRIAN ROSS IS THE CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT AND NOT, LET'S SAY, THE OFFICE GOSSIP.
(LAUGHTER) YEAH, JIM HUMS AND HE'S TOTALLY A PORN STAR AND I...
(LAUGHTER) I'M JUST... GEORGE, I'M JUST SAYING THE KILLER IS A PORN STAR.
(LAUGHTER) OH, WAIT, I'M SORRY, THAT'S TOTALLY JOHN HOLMES BUT, UM,
WHATEVER.
(LAUGHTER) SO OF COURSE TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER...
>> AN EARLIER REPORT THAT I HAD WAS INCORRECT THAT HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE TEA PARTY IN
FACT, THAT'S A DIFFERENT JIM HOLMES.
HE IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TEA PARTY.
>> Jon: AND?
AND?
>> AND WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE'S A 24-YEAR-OLD WHITE
MALE WHO WENT TO COLORADO FOR A Ph.D..
>> Jon: NO.
NO.
THE AND "I AM REALLY (BLEEP)ING SORRY." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "REALLY SORRY.
DEEPLY SORRY." (APPLAUSE) "DEEPLY, IRREVOCABLY SORRY TO THE INNOCENT MAN THAT I CASUALLY
BASELESSLY, AND PUBLICLY ACCUSED OF, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE BEING A MASS MURDERER."
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GOOGLING HIS NAME I SAW THE NAME "THE TEA
PARTY" AND I THOUGHT "OOH,
THAT'S AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE,
I SHOULD GET THAT ON THE T.V." (LAUGHTER) THIS KILLER MAY HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE TEA PARTY.
WHO GIVES A (BLEEP)?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
WHY IS THAT?
HU?
GEORGE, TEA PARTY?
LOW TAXES?
MAD MEN?
(LAUGHTER) YOU DO THE MATH.
(LAUGHTER) NO HARM, NO FOUL, RIGHT?
EXCEPT HARM!
(LAUGHTER) AND THIS DUDE ISN'T EVEN GROUNDD?
DOESN'T GET DETENTION?
YOU'RE ABC!
SENTENCE HIM TO "WIPEOUT." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR SEGMENT
"CAN A BROTHER GET A
