HE REALLY PULLED HIMSELF UP
BY HIS BOOT STAPS.
NOW TO BE FAIR, WHEN THEY
SAW THAT SOME OF THESE
PROTESTORS WERE ADULTS WITH
CHILDREN SOME FOLKS,
COMMENTATORS DID ACKNOWLEDGE
IT.
BUT IT'S SOMEHOW SEEMED TO
MAKE THEM EVEN MORE ANGRY.
>> THE GUY THERE HE HAS A
WOMAN NEXT TO HIM WAY BABY,
SHE WAS CRAD KRAED ELLING A
BABY AND TALKING ABOUT NOT
FEEDING HIS KIDS.
SOMEHOW IT'S McDONALD'S
RESPONSIBILITY TO FEED ALL
HER KID THOSE MATTER HOW
MANY SHE HAS.
>> WHOA, NO MATTER HOW MANY
SHE HAS.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN
ADULT, NOT A POODLE.
OH, I'M SO SICK OF THESE GET
RICH WELFARE MOTHERS ASKING
FOR HANDOUTS, MOOCHING
PAYCHECKS FROM THEIR
EMPLOYERS IN EXCHANGE FOR
THE WORK THEY JUST HAVE DONE
FOR THEM.
IT SICKENS ME, THE GENERAL
CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS LIKE A
THAI MASSAGE F 2 DOESN'T
HURT, IT'S NOT WORK.
AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BET
THEIR FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR
TRACY BYRNES WRNLS THE GOAL
IS LIFE IS NOT TO BE ON
MINIMUM WAGE FOREVER.
YOUR GOAL IS TO DO A GREAT
JOB AND GET PROMOTED AND
MOVE OUT OF IT.
SO THIS NOTION THAT WE WILL
KEEP RAISING IT JUST TO
SHARE THE WEALTH BECAUSE,
WELL, WE'RE ALMOST
SOCIALISTS ANYWAY AT THIS
POINT IS RIDICULOUS.
>> WOW, WOE WHOA, WHOA,
THAT'S FERR FEWING WHAT SHE
JUST SAID WOCHLT WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT THE LINE
BETWEEN CAPITALISM AND
COMMUNISM IN AMERICA IS A
DOUBLE DIGIT MINIMUM WAGE.
I HAVE TO SAY THAT BOMB
LOOKS FAMILIAR.
I THINK I'VE SEEN HER
EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR LOW
WAGE EARNERS AND THE POOR
BEFORE.
>> IT'S INTERESTING WHENEVER
THE RICH WANT A TAX CUT
SOMEHOW WE CAN AFFORD IT BUT
WHEN WE HAVE TO --
>> 250,000 IS NOT RICH.
YOU LIVED IN THE CITY LONG
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT, IT IS
NOT RICH FOR A FAMILY OF
FOUR SENDING KIDS TO
COLLEGE.
IT ACTUALLY IS CLOSE TO
POVERTY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S
RIGHT, HEY, SHE'S RIGHT!
SHE'S RIGHT.
IF YOU WANT TO EARN TRACY
BYRNES SYMPATHY COME BACK
WHEN ARE YOU MAKING A
QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS A
YEAR.
THEN WILL YOU KNOW WHAT
POVERTY IS REALLY ALL ABOUT.
CLEARLY TRACY BYRNES APPLE
DID NOT FALL FAR FROM THE
TREE.
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
I DON'T OFTEN LIKE TO DABBLE
IN SERVICE JOURNALISM.
FRANKLY I THINK IT'S BENEATH
ME.
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DO THE
FAST FOOD WORKERS OF AMERICA
A FAVOR RIGHT NOW.
YOU SEE THESE FACES NEXT TO
ME, ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN SAYING TERRIBLE THINGS
ABOUT YOU.
SO I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
THESE FACES.
AND IF ANY OF THESE PEOPLE
HAPPEN TO COME INTO YOUR
RESTAURANT, I'M NOT SAY
SHALL DID -- I'M NOT SAYING
YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM THE
SPECIAL SAUCE, I'M JUST
SAYING I THINK IT'S PRETTY
CLEAR THEY DESERVE
TELEPHONE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
