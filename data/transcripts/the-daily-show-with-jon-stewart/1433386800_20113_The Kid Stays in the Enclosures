PSYCHO THERAPIST DR. KARENRUSSKIN.
>> WHEN I FIRST HEARD THEPHRASE FREE RANGE PARENTING,
WHAT I FOUND MYSELF THINKINGWAS HOW ANNOYED AND
DISTURBED I WAS.
THOSE PARENTS THINK MY KIDCAN HANDLE IT. WHY?
BECAUSE NOTHING IS GOING TOHAPPEN AND IF SOMETHING DOES
HAPPEN, MY KID IS SO SMART.
>> PEOPLE JUST DON'T REALIZEHOW [BLEEP] STUPID THEIR KIDS
ARE, I AGREE.
>> SEE, AS COMPARED WITHJUST 25 YEARS AGO, TODAY'S
CHILDREN ARE EXPONENTIALLYDUMBER.
>> FREE RANGE KIDS IS REALLYAN OLD-FASHIONED WAY OF
RAISING KIDS TO LET KIDSPLAY OUTSIDE SO WHEN YOUR
PARENTS PROBABLY LET YOU.

TO PUT THEMSELVES IN UTTERPERIL.
MOM, UGH.
>> IF YOU NEED HELP, TALK TOSTRANGERS.
>> WHAT.
YOU WANT KIDS TO TALK TOSTRANGERS?
>> I DO, BECAUSE, GOD FORBID,YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET
YOU ARE A KID AND THERE IS SOMEGUY FOLLOWING YOU VERY SLOWLY
IN A WHITE VAN WITH NO WINDOWS.
I WANT THAT KID TO FEELTOTALLY CONFIDENT RUNNING
ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GUYRAKING HIS LEAVES.
>> YOU WANT A KID TO GOACROSS THE STREET AND TALK
TO A RAKIST, JESUS.
BUT IT WAS JUST THIS KINDOF VISION THAT CREATED A
NIGHTMARE FOR A MARYLANDCOUPLE WHO THOUGHT THEIR SIX
AND TEN YEAR OLDS WERE SMARTENOUGH TO WALK HOME ALONE
THREE ENTIRE BLOCKS FROM APLAYGROUND.

911.

BEEN WALKING AROUND FORPROBABLY 20 MINUTES BY
THEMSELVES.
>> BUT LUCKILY,  AUTHORITIESCAME TO THE RESCUE.
>> CPS FOUND THE FAMILY GUILTYOF UNSUBSTANTIATED CHILD
NEGLECT.
>> THOSE MADE UP SOUNDINGCHARGES WERE LATER REVERSED
BUT NOT TO WORRY, THEPARENTS ARE STILL UNDER
INVESTIGATION.
NO DOUBT FOR EVEN MOREUNSUBSTANTIATED CHARGES.
>> PARENTS ARE ALLOWED TOLET THEIR CHILDREN GO OUT TO
THE PARK ALONE IF THEY WANTTO.
>> BUT THEY MAY SUFFER THECONSEQUENCES OF ARREST.
>> THERE IS A POSSIBILITY,OF COURSE.
>> BUT SKENAZY THINKS TIMES,THEY ARE A-CHANGING.
>> KIDS TODAY ARE SAFER THANPROBABLY WHEN YOU WERE GROWING
UP.
>> YES, BECAUSE SMART PEOPLEARE LOCKING THEIR KIDS
INSIDE.
>> THOSE PARENTS ARE FORGETTINGTHAT ALL CRIME IS DOWN.
CRIME IS DOWN AGAINST ADULTS.

IT'S THE GOLDEN AGE OFTELEVISION.
>> THE REST OF THE WORLDSENDS THEIR KIDS WALKING TO
SCHOOL AT AGE 7 AND IN JAPANTHEY ARE TAKING THE SUBWAY.
>> IN JAPAN THEY CRUSH FROGSFOR SEXUAL PLEASURE SO --
>> SKENAZY BRAZENLY USESSTATISTICS AND FACTS ABOUT
CRIME GOING DOWN TO PUSH HERPRO CHILD UPDUCTION IDEOLOGY,
BUT DR. RUSKIN KNOWS BETTER.
>> HOW ABOUT THE CHILD WHOWAS CHOPPED UP INTO PIECES
BECAUSE HE GOT LOST. WELL, HE'SDEAD.
>> THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
>> ALTHOUGH CRIME DOESN'THAPPEN ALL THE TIME --
>> MOST OF THE TIME.
>> ALTHOUGH CRIME DOESN'THAPPEN ALL THE TIME OR MOST
OF THE TIME, WHATEVER STATSYOU WANT TO PULL OUT-- IT
DOESN'T MATTER THE QUANTITY.
>> IT'S THE QUALITY.
>> CRIME HAPPENS.
>> LESS THAN IT USED TOHAPPEN BEFORE, BIG DEAL.
>> SOME PEOPLE SAY THATCRIME HAPPENS LESS THAN IT
USED TO HAPPEN BEFORE.>> STATISTICIANS.
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THATTHERE IS NO CRIME.
>> AND WHEN THERE IS NO CRIME,THEN THOSE KIDS CAN RUN OUT
AND PLAY BUT UNTIL THAT DAY, --
>> IN THE END, IT'S UP TOPARENTS TO DECIDE IF GAMBLING
WITH THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES ISRIGHT FOR THEM.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MYFAMILY, WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT.
