(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
WE'RE TALKING WITHGENERAL TONY ZINNI.
THE BOOK IS "BEFORE THE FIRSTSHOTS ARE FIRED," AND,
OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST SHOTS HAVEBEEN FIRED HERE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT AMERICA'SSTRATEGY AS, YOU KNOW, THE
WORLD'S SUPERPOWER.
ARE WE SEEING THE LIMITS OF OURPOWER, THAT WE CANNOT GO IN,
CREATE THESE POWER VACUUMS ANDTHEN NATION BUILD TO THE POINT
WHERE A COUNTRY IS STABLE ENOUGHAND FRIENDLY ENOUGH TO OUR
PURPOSES THAT WE CAN PROJECT OURPOWER EFFECTIVELY IN THAT
REGARD?
>> I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLYSEEING THE LIMITS OF OUR ABILITY
TO TRANSITION NATIONS THAT MAYBE LOCKED IN THE NINTH OR TENTH
CENTURY INTO SOMETHING LIKEJEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRACY,
FREE MARKET ECONOMY.
WE KID OURSELVES WITH THE SHAKEAND BAKE DEMOCRACY THAT WE
TRY TO IMPOSE AND ELECTION DOESNOT EQUAL DEMOCRACY.
WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS WE'RETRYING TO DO IT ON THE CHEAP.
I THINK CERTAINLYBACK AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II,
GEORGE MARSHALL, TRUMAN,KENNON, OTHERS
UNDERSTOOD YOU CAN'T DO THIS ONTHE CHEAP.
YOU HAVE TO COMMIT TO IT.
FOR US TO GO IN AND MILITARIZE ASOLUTION, OUR SOLDIERS ARE
TRYING TO REBUILD NATIONS, WEDON'T EVEN HAVE THE EXPERTISE
FROM OUR OTHER AGENCIES OFGOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE THE SIZE AND THE RESOURCESTO DO THIS.
AND WE GET MIRED DOWN AND WEDON'T HAVE THE COST OR BE
WILLING TO EXPEND THE COSTNECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THIS.
YOU KNOW, SO WE'VE FORGOTTEN HOWIT SHOULD BE DONE.
WE'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO APPLY ALLOUR ELEMENTS OF POWER.
>> Jon: HAVE WE FALLEN TOO INLOVE WITH THE MARSHALL PLAN
MENTALITY? YOU KNOW,
GERMANY AND JAPAN, FOR ALL THEIRISSUES, WERE HOMOGENOUS AREAS
WHERE THERE WAS A REAL NATIONSTATE THAT HELD TOGETHER.
THESE ARE MUCH MORE FRACTIOUS,MUCH MORE TRIBAL.
IN MANY RESPECTS, WESTERNINVENTIONS OF BORDERS, THE IDEA
THAT WE CAN CREATE POWER VACUUMSAND REBUILD THEM TO SEEM STABLE
SEEMS FOOLHEARTY.>> WELL, IT ABSOLUTLY IS.
I MEAN, YOUR POINT ABOUTTHE BORDERS, THIS IS SYKES-PICOT
AT THE END OF THE WORLD WAR I
WHERE THE FRENCH AND BRITISHCARVED UP NATIONS ACROSS TRIBAL
AND RELIGIOUS LINES, THAT WE'REPAYING FOR TODAY.
I THINK OUR INVOLVEMENT OUTTHERE CAN'T BE ALONE.
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILDPARTNERSHIPS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS,INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS.
I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE U.N.RESOLUTION THAT AUTHORIZES US TO
USE FORCE HERE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I MEAN, IN THE FIRST GULFWAR, WE HAD IT.
>> Jon: IT'S THE GREATESTTHREAT TO THE WORLD WE'VE EVER
SEEN, AND YET WE CAN'T GET EVENA PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS THIS
ISN'T SO GOOD OUT OF THE UNITEDNATIONS.
>> AND WHERE ARE THE EUROPEANNATIONS IN THIS ALLIANCE?
BESIDES THE FRENCH, THERE'SNOBODY ELSE THAT SHOWING UP.
>> Jon: BUT EVEN THEN THAT'SSTILL A WESTERN POWER THAT'S
IMPOSING IT'S VALUEAND ITS MILITARY SOLUTIONS.
WHERE ARE THE NATIONS WHO BEARSOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE FUNDING AND CREATION OFTHESE GROUPS?
SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, TURKEY,TURKEY'S BORDER REMAINS OPEN.
THE QATARIS FOR GOD SAKES HAVECERTAINLY FUNNELED MONEY TO SOME
OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS. THESAUDIS AS WELL.
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY ONTHAT REGARD.
>> I THINK IN MANY CASES YOU'RESEEING NATIONS THAT ARE TRYING
TO PLAY BOTH SIDES. YOU KNOW,BECAUSE I.S.I.S. WOULD DESTROY
THE ROYAL FAMILY INSAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER EMIRS
IN THE REGION IN A HEARTBEAT AND THEY'RE CAUGHT BETWEEN
TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO USEFORCE AND REMOVE THEM, TRYING TO
BUY THEM OFF AND THEY'RECONFUSED.
DO THEY FOLLOW US?
WILL WE BE THERE?
WILL WE ENDURE THROUGH ALL THIS?SO, YOU KNOW, THEIR PROBLEM
IS THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGUREOUT HOW TO SHUT THEIR EYES
TO THIS PROBLEM AND THEIR TRYINGEVERY METHOD POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE
IT MANY OF WHICH JUST EXACERBATETHE PROBLEM THEY'RE FACING.
>> Jon: UNTIL THEY HAVECLARITY IN THE FIGHT, HOW CAN WE
BE EXPECTED TO EVEN BE INSERVICE OF STABILIZING OR
HELPING?
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T IF YOU DON'TUNDERSTAND THE CULTURE, AND IF
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THESITUATION.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I WAS IN THE UNITED ARABEMIRATES WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH,
GEORGE BUSH MADE THE CASEFOR THE WAR IN IRAQ.
>> Jon: I'M NOT FAMILIAR BUT GOAHEAD.
>> YEAH. HE SAID SOMETHING TOTHE EFFECT THIS WAS ABOUT
THE FORCES OF FREEDOM ANDDEMOCRACY AGAINST THE FORCES
OF AUTHORITARIANISMAND EVIL. I HAD AN ARAB FRIEND
NUDGE ME AND SAY THISIS ABOUT PERSIANS VERSUS ARABS.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO RELEASE A DEVILTHAT WE'VE TRIED TO KEEP
CONTAINED. THE ARABON THE OTHER SIDE NUDGED ME
AND HE SAIDTHIS IS ABOUT SHIA VERSUS SUNNI,
YOU'RE GOING TO RELEASE ARELIGIOUS WAR.
WELL, THEY WERE ALL RIGHT. BUT IDON'T KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT
UNDERSTOOD THOSE TWO OTHERLEVELS AND THE SETS OF
CONSEQUENCES.
>> Jon: MAN, WE WERE TWO WEEKSINTO THE BOMBING, I THINK,
BEFORE AMERICA REALIZED THEREWERE TWO FORMS OF ISLAM.
I DON'T EVEN THINK WE KNEW SUNNIAND SHIA. PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
WHERE'S SYRIA AGAIN?WHAT'S HAPPENING?
YOU KNOW, WE SEEMED TO LEARNABOUT RELIGION AND GEOGRAPHY
AFTER WE BOMB IT. IT'S REALLY,IT'S NUTS.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF
MINUTES, YOU'LL STICKAROUND TO EXPLAIN?
>> YEP.>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
"BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS AREFIRED" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES
NOW. GENERAL TONY ZINNI.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
