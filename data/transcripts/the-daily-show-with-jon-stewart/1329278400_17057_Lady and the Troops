>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST, OH, SO APROPOS.
RICKEY JER VASE.
YOU KNOW WHY?
VALENTINE'S DAY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
TREAT CUPID'S GOT FOR THE FAIRER
SEX.
OH, NO, DON'T!
DON'T.
YOU DESERVE THIS.
LADIES?
>> AMERICA'S WOMEN IN UNIFORM
MAY SOON HAVE NEW RULES ON THE
BATTLEFIELD.
THE PENTAGON TODAY CHANGED ITS
RULES TO GIVE WOMEN JOBS IN MORE
FORWARD POSITIONS, CLOSER TO THE
FRONT LINES.
>> Jon: DO YOU LIKE IT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S RIGHT, LADIES, FRONT LINE
COMBAT ROLES, TRY IT ON!
THE HELMET'S SUPPOSED TO BE
SNUG.
ALL US GUYS THOUGHT IT WAS A
PRETTY SWELL IDEA.
YOU'VE EARNED IT.
WELL, ALMOST ALL US GUYS.
>> I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
WOMEN IN FRONT-LINE COMBAT.
>> Jon: OH, WHAT A SURPRISE.
PRINCE VON STICK UP HIS ASS.
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY, THAT WAS NOT FAIR.
THAT WAS CRASS.
I APOLOGIZE.
THE MAN'S A FORMER SENATOR, HAS
EXPERIENCE HANDLING MILITARY
ISSUES.
LET'S GO RIGHT TO THE PENTAGON
AND ASK.
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
>> I'VE SEEN WOMEN IN COMBAT
PERFORM AN EXPANDED ROLE AND I'M
VERY PROUD OF THEM.
THEY'RE BRAVE WOMEN ALONG WITH
THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS AND A
LOT TO BE SAID FOR THEIR
CONTRIBUTION AND EXPERIENCES
OVER THE LAST DECADE OF WAR.
AND I'M... I'M PROUD OF WHAT
WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY.
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT ALL SOUNDS
VERY THOROUGH.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY KNOW
ABOUT THE MILITARY, GENERAL
PATTON?
(LAUGHTER)
HELP ME OUT, SANTORUM.
>> YOU HAVE MEN AND WILL
TOGETHER IN COMBAT, I THINK
THERE'S... MEN HAVE EMOTIONS
WHEN YOU SEE A WOMAN IN HARM'S
WAY.
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
NATURAL, THAT'S VERY MUCH IN OUR
CULTURE TO BE PROTECTIVE.
THE ISSUE IS HOW MEN WOULD REACT
TO SEEING WOMEN IN HARM'S WAY OR
POTENTIALLY BEING INJURED OR IN
A VULNERABLE POSITION AND NOT BE
CONCERNED ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING
THE MISSION.
>> Jon: THAT'S IT.
IT'S NOT THE WOMEN!
SANTORUM IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE
MEN.
(LAUGHTER)
AND HOW CONCERNED THEY'LL BE
ABOUT THE WOMEN!
LIKE THE RAID ON BIN LADEN'S
SAFE HOUSE.
TEAM OF MEN.
LAND A CHOPPER IN THE COMPOUND.
THEY BREAK IN THE DOOR.
THEY CHARGE UP THE STAIRS.
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
BUT IMAGINE A WOMAN WAS THERE.
THEY LAND IN THE COMPOUND.
THEY HEAD OFF TO THE SAFE HOUSE.
THERE'S A PUDDLE.
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE
RIGHT THING.
THERE YOU GO.
THEN WHEN THEY BREAK DOWN THE
DOOR THEY GO "LADIES FIRST."
SHE WALKS BY, THE SCENT OF HER
PERFUME, HE'S ATTRACTED.
OH, MISSION UNACCOMPLISHED!
IT'S UNAVOIDABLE!
LET'S FACE IT.
WAR IS EASIER WHEN IT'S ALL
DUDES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT
EACH OTHER.
IT'S LIKE THE MARINE CORPS MOTTO
SAYS: LEAVE AS MANY MEN BEHIND
AS YOU WANT.
NO BIG DEAL.
WE'RE ALL DUDES.
