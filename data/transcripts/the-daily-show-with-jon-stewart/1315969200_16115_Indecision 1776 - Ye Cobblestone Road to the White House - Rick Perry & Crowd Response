CNN SLAM!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
BUT I BELIEVE THERE WAS A POINT
TO LAST NIGHT'S APAIR GASM.
(LAUGHTER)
NIGHT'S... AMERI-GASM.
WHICH WAS FOR SEVEN AMBITIOUS
REPUBLICANS TO GIVE A
JEWELSY-FUELED BEAT DOWN
FOR-TO-ONE OTHER REPUBLICAN.
>> FOR RICK TO SAY YOU CAN'T
SECURE THE BOARDER IS A
TREASONOUS COMMENT.
>> GOVERNOR PERRY PROVIDED BY
IN-STATE TUITION FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.
MAYBE THAT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO
ATTRACT THE VOTE.
>> GOVERNOR PERRY POINTED OUT IN
HIS VIEW SOCIAL SECURITY IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND THE
GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE MIGHT RAISE
MY TAXES OR SOMETHING!
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE DRUG COMPANY GAVE
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN
POLITICAL DONATIONS TO THE
GOVERNOR AND THIS IS HIS FLAT...
THIS IS FLAT OUT WRONG.
>> Jon: THROUGH IT ALL PERRY
KEPT GRINNING AND SCRIBBLING
AWAY ON HIS PAD.
WHAT'S HE WRITING, ANYWAY?
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT... OH!
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S... HMM.
SURPRISING.
QUITE TALENTED.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WILL THE ATTACKS ON PERRY
SLOW HIS MOMENTUM?
WHO THE HELL KNOWS.
PERRY'S ALREADY LEADING THE RACE
WITHOUT MAKING ANY SENSE.
>> $2 BILLION A WEEK.
IS THAT MONEY WELL SPENT BY U.S.
TAXPAYERS IN AFGHANISTAN?
>> IT'S TIME TO BRING OUR YOUNG
MEN AND WOMEN HOME AS SOON AND,
OBVIOUSLY, AS SAFELY AS WE CAN.
BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A
PRESENCE THERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: (IN TEXAS ACCENT)
WOLF, WE'VE GOT TO BRING THEM
HOME.
AND STAY.
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE BUT I DON'T
THINK ANYBODY WOULD ARGUE WE
SHOULD STAY.
BUT HE DELIVERS IT IN SUCH A
HOME-SPUN LIKABLE WAY YOU'RE
ALREADY HALFWAY HOME BEFORE YOU
REALIZE, "HEY, THAT MADE NO
(BLEEP)ING SENSE.
OH, WHAT THE HELL, I'LL VOTE FOR
HIM ANYWAY."
OF COURSE, THE REAL STAR OF THE
NIGHT, THE TEA PARTY ITSELF WHO,
WHILE LARGELY OFF CAMERA WERE
CLEARLY MICKED.
>> I WILL USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
TO GET RID OF AS MUCH OF
OBAMACARE AS I CAN ON DAY ONE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: YEAH!
OBAMACARE, BOO!
>> WELL, I WAS GOING SAY, MITT,
YOU WERE DOING PRETTY GOOD UNTIL
YOU GOT TO TALKING POKER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> POKER!
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.
A HEALTHY 30-YEAR-OLD YOUNG MAN
HAS A GOOD JOB BUT DECIDES, YOU
KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND $200 OR
$300 A MONTH FOR HEALTH
INSURANCE BECAUSE I'M HEALTHY, I
DON'T NEED IT.
BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAPPENS.
WHO'S GOING TO PAY IF HE GOES
INTO A COMA.
>> THAT'S WHAT FREEDOM IS ALL
ABOUT.
TAKING YOUR OWN RISKS.
THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE
TO...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
... PREPARE AND TAKE CARE OF
EVERYBODY.
>> FREEDOM IS RISKY!
YAY!
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT SOCIETY
SHOULD JUST LET HIM DIE?
>> YES!
>> YES!
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF
EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE
SHOUTING "YES" HEARD DR. PAUL
SAY "NO," BUT YAY FOR UNINSURED
PATIENTS BEING... I'M CONFUSED.
(LAUGHTER)
I REALLY HOPE THE PERSON WHO
JUST SHOUTED "KILL THE MOTHER
(BLEEP)ER".
(LAUGHTER)
TURNED TO THE PERSON NEXT TO HIM
AND WENT "WE'RE STILL CHEERING
FOR POKER, RIGHT?"
(LAUGHTER)
"OTHERWISE I'D SOUND KIND OF
LIKE A
