THAT'S JOHN LEWIS! THAT'S HIM!
HE WAS LIKE THE FIRST GUYOVER THE BRIDGE.
ON HIS WAY TO BILLY CLUBALLEY, MARCHING IN GREAT
DANGER FOR CIVIL RIGHTS.
LOOK AT YOU, JUST SITTINGTHERE ON YOUR [BLEEP] COUCH.
YEAH, I SEE YOU.
HOW'S THE BEN & JERRY'S,HERO?
SORRY.
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T KNOW WHY I TURNED
THAT INTO A PERSONAL ATTACKON YOU THE VIEWER.
THE 15-TERM GEORGIA CONGRESSMANIS NOW 75 YEARS OLD.
BUT SATURDAY HIS 25-YEAR-OLDSATURDAY WAS NOT FAR FROM
HIS THOUGHTS.
>> IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD METHAT WE WERE CROSSING THIS
BRIDGE, THAT ONE DAY I WOULDBE BACK HERE INTRODUCED AS
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICANPRESIDENT, I WOULD HAVE SAID
YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RETALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: THAT'S INSPIRING.
I THINK THAT IS A VERYINSPIRING THING.
I'M NOT GOING TOOBVIOUSLY TELL THE PEOPLE
WHO RAN THE COMMEMORATION, THE50TH COMMEMORATION OF SELMA
HOW TO DO THEIR JOB.
IF IT'S ME, I GET THE FIRSTGUY OVER THE BRIDGE FIGHTING
FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AN APPLEBOX.
I GET HIM AN APPLE BOX.
I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENTIS THERE, HE'S VERY TALL AND
THEY SET UP THE MICROPHONEFOR HIM.
BUT-- (LAUGHTER)
AS A MAN OF SIMILARSTATURE, I'M SORRY, I'M VERY
SENSITIVE TO THIS TYPE OFTHING.
I FEEL LIKE-- CAN ABROTHER GET A PHONE BOOK IS
WHAT I'M SAYING.
JUST TO STAND ON.
AND THEN, AND THEN IT WAS TIMEFOR THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN
PRESIDENT TO DELIVER THEREMARKS A YOUNG JOHN LEWIS
THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER HEAR.
>> WHAT GREATER FORM OFPATRIOTISM IS IT THAN THE
BELIEF THAT AMERICA IS NOTYET FINISHED.
THAT WE ARE STRONG ENOUGH TOBE SELF-CRITICAL.
THAT EACH SUCCESSIVEGENERATION CAN LOOK UPON OUR
IMPERFECTIONS AND DECIDETHAT IT IS IN OUR POWER TO
REMAKE THIS NATION TO MORECLOSELY ALIGN WITH OUR
HIGHEST IDEALS.
>> Jon: NO, ONCE AGAIN,BARACK HUSSEIN O-POLOGY
REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE AMERICANEXCEPTIONALISM.
EVERYONE KNOWS THE GREATEST FORMOF PATRIOTISM IS
HAVING THE COURAGE TO ADMIT OUR
PERFECTION.
PREFERABLY IN FLAG PIN FORM.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,IF WE WEREN'T NUMBER ONE,
WOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TOSELL THOSE? I DON'T THINK SO.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE CONTINUE, MR. PRESIDENT,
YOUR ASSAULT ON REAL AMERICA.
>> WHEN IT FEELS THE ROAD'STOO HARD, WHEN THE TORCH
WE'VE BEEN PASSED FEELS TOOHEAVY, WE WILL REMEMBER
THESE EARLY TRAVELERS, ANDDRAW STRENGTH FROM THEIR
EXAMPLE.
AND HOLD FIRMLY TO THE WORDSOF THE PROPHET ISAIAH.
THOSE WHO HOPE IN THE LORDWILL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH.
THEY WILL SOAR ON THE WINGSLIKE EAGLES.
THEY WILL RUN AND NOT GROWWEARY.
THEY WILL WALK AND NOT BEFAINT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SORRY, SORRY.
I'M NOT CRYING.
I ALLERGIC TO BEING INSPIRED.
WOW!
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THEBLOODY SUNDAY MARCH IS AN
IMPORTANT AND INSPIRINGMOMENT IN HISTORY.
IT'S RELEVANCE NOT LOST ONTHOSE SENT TO COVER IT.
>> EXCLUSIVE CNN DRONE VIDEO.
>> THIS EXCLUSIVE CNN DRONEVIDEO STANDS AS A TESTAMENT TO
AND A REMINDER OF THE COURAGEOUSPEOPLE.
>> TAKEN BY A CNN DRONECAMERA.
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME CNNHAS USED A DRONE DURING OUR
SHOOTING OF THIS STORY OF
THE NEW FAAREGULATIONS.
>> THAT FOOTAGE WASEXTRAORDINARY AND REALLY
HELPED TELL THE STORY.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YES, WHAT
EXTRAORDINARY BRIDGE DRONEFOOTAGE.
WITHOUT THAT FOOTAGE, WEWOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHAT
KIND OF BRIDGE THEY MARCHEDACROSS.
A DENTAL BRIDGE, JEFFBRIDGES.
BRIDGET FONDA-- WEDON'T-- BUT YOU KNOW,
GETTING BRIDGE FOOTAGE ISNOTORIOUSLY TRICKY BASE ON HOW
SHAKY BRIDGES CAN BE.
CAN WE GET BACK TO THEHISTORICAL COMMEMORATION OF
THE MARCH?
>> TELL US HOW THIS CAME TOBE.
>> I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLETEAM WORKED VERY HARD TO SHOW
PEOPLE THE IMAGES OF THATBRIDGE.
WOW, IT REALLY KIND OF--REMEMBERS YOU 50 YEARS AGO HOW
POWERFUL VIDEO WAS INTERMS OF LETTING THE COUNTRY
TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.
WE TALKED TO SO MANY PEOPLEWHO WATCHED THAT DRONE GO UP
AND THEY WERE HAPPY WE WERETAKING THAT LOOK WITH THAT
SPECIAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: ONE MAN, ONE MAN WAS
SO MOVED HE REMARKED, I HAVEA DRONE!
(LAUGHTER)THAT ONE DAY-- THAT ONE DAY
SONS OF SLAVES AND SONS OFSLAVE OWNERS COULD SIT
TOGETHER AND SAY OH, YEAH,LOOK AT THAT.
I HAVE A DRONE!
THAT A NEWS CHANNEL WILL BEJUDGED NOT BY THE CONTENT OF
ITS CONTENT, BUT BY THEUSELESSNESS OF ITS GIZMOS.
CAN WE JUST GET BACK TO THECOMMEMORATION OF THE
STRUGGLE.
>> SO RYAN, WHILE THAT ISINCREDIBLE VIEW,
IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT EXEMPLIFYTHAT IT IS JUST THAT EASY
FOR ANYONE TO PUT A DRONE UPWITH A CAMERA AND START
TAKING PICTURES.
>> Jon: NOT THAT STRUGGLE!
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW, CNN, I PROMISE YOU,
EVERYONE WOULD BE FINE WITHYOUR CNN TECHNOLOGY IF YOU
WOULD JUST SHUT THE [BLEEP]UP ABOUT IT.
STOP ACTING-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LIKE YOU-- YOU HAVETO-- STOP ACTING LIKE YOU
LAUNCHED A SPACE STATION ORMADE AN APPLE WATCH.
YOU GOT DRONE FOOTAGE.
WHICH WE CAN NOW ADD TO THE495,000 OTHER DRONE FOOTAGE
VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE.
OR SAY EVERY DAD WHO FOUNDTHE BEST BUY INSERT IN THE
NEWSPAPER.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, THE DAILYSHOWED USED A DRONE IN A
FIELD PIECE AND WE'RE IDIOTS.BUT IT MAKES ME WONDER,
IF CNN WAS ABLE TO MAKE THECOMMEMORATION ABOUT HOW COOL
THEIR COVERAGE WAS, COULDTHEIR COMPETITION BE EQUALLY
TRUE TO THEIR ESSENCE, THEIRSIGNATURE STYLE.
FOR INSTANCE, COULD FOX TAKETHIS COMMEMORATION OF
COURAGEOUS CIVIL RIGHTSMARCHERS AND SOMEHOW TURN IT
INTO WHITE CONSERVATIVEVICTIMIZATION?
>> CRITICS ONCE AGAIN AREACCUSING "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" OF HAVING A LIBERALBIAS.
>> NOTICE ANYTHING MISSING FROMTHE FRONT PAGE OF THE "NEW
YORK TIMES".
>> THE PAPER CROPPEDPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AND
HIS WIVE LAURA OUT OF THEFRONT PAGE PICTURE FROM THE
SELMA ALABAMA ANNIVERSARYMARCH.
>> OVERSIGHT?
OR ON PURPOSE?
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: YOU ARE AMAZING.
YOU KNOW, FOR ME, IT'S KINDOF READILY APPARENT WHEN YOU
SEE THE TWO PHOTOSSIDE-BY-SIDE, THAT "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" HAS A DISTINCTBIAS AGAINST [BLEEP]
PICTURES.
BOTTOM PICTURE YOU CAN'T REALLYTELL WHAT IS GOING ON,
BUT THE TOP IT'S OKAY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROMFINDING THE AGGRIEVED WHITE
MAN ANGLE.
CNN MAY HAVE FLYING ROBOTCAMERAS, BUT FOX HAS DRONES.
OH, NO, PLEASE DON'T --PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THAT-- OH,
CNN, WE GET IT.
YOU HAVE A DRONE.
SOMEBODY GET ME A NET AND ABASEBALL BAT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
