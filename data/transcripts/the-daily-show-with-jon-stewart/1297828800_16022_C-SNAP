(BEEP) DICTATOR.
OOPS.
BUT OF COURSE THE MIDDLE EAST
ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE WHERE
CITIZENS ARE CALLING FOR AN
OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT.
THERE WAS A GROUP OF
REVOLUTIONARIES CLOSER TO HOME
SPECIFICALLY AT WASHINGTON
D.C. WHERE REPUBLICANS
GATHERED FOR C-PAC, THE
CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION
CONFERENCE THAT WAS LAST YEAR
REFERRED TO AS THE REPUBLICAN
WOOD STOCK.
WHAT THIS YEAR'S THEME.
>> THE PRESIDENT WENT FROM
CHANGE YOU CAN BELIEVE IN TO
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS CHANGE?
>> THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING,
OBAMA MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO
BECOMING THE PRESIDENT OF
EGYPT.
NOBODY WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT
HIM BEING A MUSLIM THEN.
>> Jon: BOOM!
IT'S LIKE A ROAST.
THIS YEAR IT'S A ROAST.
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THEM COMEDY
CENTRAL THINGS ONLY WITH
BARACK OBAMA AS THEIR PAMELA
ANDERSON AND SOCIALISM AS
THOUGH SHE WAS MARRIED TO
SOMEONE WITH A COMICALLY LARGE
PENIS.
LIKE ALL ROASTS, COMICS WITH
DIFFERENT STYLES GATHERED.
LET'S GO WITH THE OLD PRO
FREDDY ROMAN.
>> WASHINGTON HAS UNDERGONE A
RATHER BIZARRE TRANSFORMATION.
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS.
OL BER MAN IS OUT AND REAGAN
IS IN.
>> Jon: THAT WAS A GREAT JOKE
FROM SOMEONE BEST KNOWN FOR
BEING WHAT YOU HAVE TO DRAW TO
GET INTO ART SCHOOL.
BOOM!
GOOD STUFF.
LET'S SEE HOW THE C-PAC GAME
COOK WOULD FAIR, THE GUY WHO
IS HUNKY BUT NOBODY EVER
ADMITS TO LIKING.
>> THIS IS THE LEADER OF THE
FREE WORLD'S ANSWER TO THE
GREATEST JOB CRISIS SINCE THE
GREAT DEPRESSION?
WHAT'S NEXT?
LET THEM EAT CAKE?
EXCUSE ME.
LET THEM EAT ORGANIC CAKE?
>> Jon: BANG!
HE STOLE THAT JOKE.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I'M
IMPRESSED SO FAR WITH THE
MATERIAL AND THE PERFORMANCES.
WHERE IS THE COMIC YOU
SECRETLY FIND REALLY HOT BUT
HOPE NEVER EVER BECOMES
PRESIDENT.
>> YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE
PRESIDENT OF CHINA IS NAMED
HU.
HIS NAME IS PRESIDENT HU.
AND WITH ALL THE MONEY THAT WE
OWE CHINA, I THINK WE MIGHT
RIGHTLY SAY HU'S YOUR DADDY.
>> Jon: OKAY.
SO NOW WE KNOW HOW YOU WOULD
TELL A JOKE TO
KINDERGARTENERS.
OR AN ENGLISH AS A SECOND
LANGUAGE CLASS.
NEITHER OF THEM ARE THERE.
OF COURSE LIKE ALL ROASTS
CERTAIN THEMES GET BEATEN TO
THE GROUND.
JOAN RIVERS HAD SOME WORK
DONE.
THE GUY IS SO OLD HE TAKES HIS
TEETH OUT WHEN YOU'RE BLOWING
HIM.
(LAUGHING)
SO WHAT'S THE LINE ON OBAMA?
>> I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN BY BIRTH.
AND I DO HAVE THE BIRTH
CERTIFICATE TO PROVE IT.
>> I'M NOT ONE WHO QUESTIONS
THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH
CERTIFICATE AND THE EXISTENCE
OF HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIS
POLICY, DON'T YOU AT LEAST
WONDER WHAT PLANET HE'S FROM?
>> Jon: YOU'RE JUST SAYING HE
WASN'T BORN HERE.
COME ON.
HEY, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
THE "NEW YORK TIMES"?
ONE IS BLACK AND WHITE AND
FULL OF LIES.
THE OTHER IS A PUBLICATION
I'VE NEVER READ.
BOOM!
I'M NOT SAYING MALCOLM X IS
HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER BUT THAT
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS
GOING TO BE A HECKLERS BUT A
REAL PRO HANDLES IT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
(BEEP).
LIKE...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE TOTALLY
RANDOM CELEBRITY.
MUHAMMAD ALI OR GEORGE
HAMILTON FOR SOME REASON ON
THE ROAST OF DAVID HASSLEHOFF.
C-PACK BOASTED A SPECIAL
APPEARANCE FROM A REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPER WHO IS BEGINNING TO
REPRESENT A VERSION OF
HIMSELF.
>> I WISH... BY THE WAY RON
PAUL CANNOT GET ELECTED.
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, IF I RUN
AND IF I WIN, THIS COUNTRY
WILL BE RESPECTED AGAIN.
>> Jon: OH, YEAH.
YOU'D REALLY CLASS UP
WASHINGTON.
YEAH.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'D DO TO.
I WOULD GET THIS COUNTRY OUT
OF BANKRUPTCY.
THEN I'LL PUT IT BACK INTO
BANKRUPTCY.
THEN OUT AGAIN.
THEN IN AGAIN AND SO-AND-SO
FORTH UNTIL, BOOM, IT'S THE
FUTURE.
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.
