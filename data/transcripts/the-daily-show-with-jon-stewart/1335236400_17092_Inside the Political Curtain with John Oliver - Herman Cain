MAY 21st, 2011, CENTENNIAL
OLYMPIC PARK IN ATLANTA, ARE
YOU ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE YOUR
CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES, A
SOMBER HUMBLING MOMENT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> LOVE Y'ALL!
MY, MY, MY!
LOVIA!
AH, SCHUKY DUCKY IS THE MAN
TODAY.
>> WHAT THOUGHTS WERE GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND AT THAT
TIME?
ANY?
>> AH SCHUKY DUCKY WAS A WAY
FOR ME TO SAY I AM THRILLED
TO BE HERE, AND I AM HAPPY
THAT YOU ARE HAPPY THAT I'M
HERE.
>> WHY NOT JUST SAY THAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT WOULD BE TOO FORMAL.
>> SO IT WAS TOO FORMAL FOR
A SPEECH IN WHICH YOU ARE
ANNOUNCING YOU ARE RUNNING
FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN
THE LAJD.
>> YES, YES.
ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY I DID
NOT HAVE A SCRIPT.
>> WHY WRITE A SPEECH WHEN
YOU CAN JUST SAY THE FIRST
THING THAT COMES INTO YOUR
HEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT IS TRUE.
INFORMALITY, I FIND,
CONNECTS MUCH MORE WITH
PEOPLE THAN FORMALITY.
>> HERMAN CAIN SHOWED US
THAT IMPRO I HAVIZATION ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL CAN LEAD
TO SOME MEMORABLE MOMENTS.
>> WHEN THEY ASKED ME WHO IS
THE OF THE UBEKBEKBEKI
STANOZOLOL I'M GOING TO SAY
KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU
KNOW.
THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN KNOW
THE HEAD OF STATE FOR ALL OF
THE NEARLY 200 NATIONS ON
THE PLANET.
>> IT CAN'T BE DONE.
>> NO.
>> NO HUMAN COULD REMEMBER.
>> YOU POSSIBLY COULD BUT
YOU WOULD SPEND ALL OF YOUR
TIME TRYING TO REMEMBER WHO
THE HEAD OF UZBEK STAN.
>> I HAVE A QUESTION, I HOPE
YOU DON'T DISAPPOINT.
WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF
UZBEKISTAN?
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE PRESIDENT OF UZBEKISTAN
UZBEKISTAN--
(LAUGHTER)
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THEM
AND HAVE NOT FOUND OUT
SINCE.
>> I DID GO AND LOOK IT UP.
AND AT ONE POINT I KNEW HIS
NAME.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SINCE IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I USE EVERY DAY, IT'S
GONE AGAIN AND THEN --
>> YOU AGREED WITH PRESIDENT
OBAMA ON LIBYA OR NOT?
>> OKAY, LIBYA, PRESIDENT
OBAMA SUPPORTED ITS UPRISING,
CORRECT?
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING
BEFORE I AM SAYING YES I
AGREE OR NO, I DIDN'T AGREE.
>> THAT WAS AN AWKWARD
MOMENT.
>> WAS IT?
>> YES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT T WAS.
>> IT WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.
>> EXTREMELY AWKWARD.
>> AND I ADMIT.
>> YOU BELIEVEABLY AWKWARD.
>> YES.
>> BESIDES HERMAN CAIN WHO
IS YOUR FAVORITE FICTIONAL
PRESIDENT?
>> FAVORITE FICTIONAL
PRESIDENT.
>> OF THE MOVIES, OF
TELEVISION.
>> THERE ARE NO FICTIONAL
PRESIDENTS.
>> YOU MEAN MY FAVORITE
PRESIDENT THAT WAS PORTRAYED
IN A MOVIE?
IS THAT WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?
>> WE'RE BACK INTO THAT
LIBYA SITUATION AGAIN.
AND THIS QUESTION IF IT'S
POSSIBLE IS EVEN EASIER THAN
THAT ONE.
>> YOU SHOULD NOT ANSWER
QUESTIONS TOO QUICKLY, IF
YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE
QUESTION.
>> IF WILL YOU HUMOR ME, LET
US END OUR JOURNEY TONIGHT
WITH A ROLE PLAY EXPLORING
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
YOU ARE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
RERT IS BEING ATTACKED BY
ALIENS.
YOU ARE STANDING ON THE
SMOLTEDERING REMAINS OF WHAT
USED TO BE THE OVAL OFFICE.
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO
ADDRESS THE EARTH'S
INHABITANT ITS, TO INSPIRE
THEM TO RISE UP AND RAPEL
THEIR ALIEN IN-- INVADERS,
LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA AND
ACTION.
>> CITIZENS OF EARTH, IT WAS
THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT
BUILT THIS PLANITY.
IT IS THAT SAME SPIRIT OF
HUMAN NATURE WILL ALLOW US
TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST
UNKNOWN ENEMIES.
IT IS THAT SAME SPIRIT OF
HUMANITY THAT WILL ALLOW US
TO DESTROY THE ALIENS.
