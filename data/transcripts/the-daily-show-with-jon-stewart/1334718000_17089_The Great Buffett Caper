SO JUST AS AMERICANS ARE WRITING THEIR CHECKS TO THE I.R.S.,
SENATE DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED TO BRING TO A VOTE THE BUFFETT RULE THAT ENSURINGS PEOPLE EARNING
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PAY AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 30% INCLUDING INVESTMENT INCOME AS
OPPOSED TO THE JIMMY BUFFETT RULE WHICH IS WHICH ASSURES THAT... WHAT'S THAT?
OH, EVERYBODY'S DONE THAT JOKE ALREADY?
ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) HOW ABOUT THE BUFFET RULE THAT SAYS YOU SHOULD USE THE TONGS FOR...
(LAUGHTER).
I'M JUST BEING STUPID.
I UNDERSTAND.
TO THE SENATE FLOOR.
>> THE BUFFETT TAX WOULD RAISE A MERE PITTANCE IN THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL BUDGETS.
>> IT WOULD COVER ABOUT TWO DAY'S WORTH OF THE DEFICITS.
>> IT WOULD RAISE ABOUT HALF OF ONE DAY'S WORTH OF FEDERAL SPENDING.
>> Jon: THAT WOULDN'T PAY FOR A HALF DAY'S WORK ON THE SECRET
REANIMATE RONALD REAGAN PROJECT... OOPS.

IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
(BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE, THE REPUBLICANS SUCCESSFULLY FILIBUSTER IT HAD BUFFETT RULE
USING 45 VOTES TO BLOCK IT FROM COMING TO THE FLOOR FOR A DEBATE.
EVEN IF THEY HAD PASSED IT REPUBLICANS KNEW IT WOULDN'T MATTER ANYWAY.
>> THE WEALTHY HAVE AN ARMY OF LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS WHO CAN HELP THEM WORK AROUND THIS

>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I DON'T GIVE THE REPUBLICANS ENOUGH CREDIT FOR BEING DEEP.
THAT'S SOME NO EXIT (BLEEP).
"THEY JUST WORK AROUND IT ANYWAY, WHAT'S THE POINT, WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.
