IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon:  HOW DID IT FEEL INTHE THEATER?
>> IT WAS A WONDERFUL FEELING.
IT FELT SPIRITUAL.
IT FELT LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO--WE WANTED TO REPRESENT SELMA AND
THAT MOVEMENT AND THE SONG"GLORY," WE WANTED TO REPRESENT
IT ON A HIGH LEVEL, AND WE FELTGREAT ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE
RESPONDED.
>> Jon:  THEY RESPONDEDAMAZINGLY.
AND THEN, WHEN YOU WON-->> THAT WAS-- I MEAN THAT'S ONE
OF THOSE FEELINGS LIKE YOU STILLDON'T REMEMBER EVERY MOMENT
BECAUSE IT WAS THINGS THATHAPPENED LIKE-- THEY SAID I
SKIPPED OVER OPRAH'S HANDCLAP-- LIKE, SHE WAS ABOUT TO
GIVE ME A LITTLE TAP AND I WENTPAST HER.
BUT I WAS-- YOU KNOW, I WAS JUSTIN THE MOMENT.
MY MOTHER WAS RIGHT THERE.
AND WHEN WE GOT UP ON THATSTAGE, IT JUST WAS LIKE, WOW,
WE ARE, THEY ANNOUNCED OUR NAMESTO WIN AN ACADEMY AWARD.
IT'S OVERWHELMING.
I'M STILL JUST SUPER GRATEFUL.
>> Jon:  IT WAS-- IT WASAMAZING AND WELL EARNED.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WHEN YOU SAY YOU DON'T REMEMBER
EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT WAS, LIKE,WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED YOUR NAME--
AND MAYBE YOU DON'T REMEMBERTHIS-- BUT AS YOU TURNED TO-- I
DON'T REMEMBER THE LEGO SONGPEOPLE-- AND YOU WENT "IN YOUR
FACE MOTHER ( BLEEP )."
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS JUST WEIRD.
I WAS LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVECOMMON JUST DID THAT.
>> YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT PART?
>> Jon: OH YOU DON'T REMEMBERTHAT?
>> NO, NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
>> NO, IT WAS GREAT.
IS IT, TO BE A PART, YOU KNOW,THIS MOVIE COMING OUT ON THE
50th ANNIVERSARY OF SELMA, ANDALL THE OCCASIONS, DOES IT BRING
YOU CLOSER TO THOSE EVENTS OFHISTORY?
DO YOU FEEL MORE CONNECTED TOIT, MORE A PART OF IT, SPENDING
TIME WITH GUYS LIKE JOHN LEWISAND REENACTING THOSE TYPES OF
THINGS?
>> YES.
YOU KNOW, I KNEW ABOUT THEHISTORY, BUT BEING ABLE TO BE AN
ACTOR IN IT AND NOW WITH SO MUCHEDUCATION ON IT AND GETTING TO
MEET JOHN LEWIS AND AMBASSADORANDREW YOUNG AND DIANE NASH.
AND SOME NAMES THAT WERE UNKNOWNBUT WE GOT TO MEET THE PEOPLE.
IT WAS LIKE WOW, WE ARECONNECTED TO THIS MOVEMENT.
I FELT LIKE "SELMA" THE FILM ISAN EXTENSION OF WHAT THEY
CREATED DURING THAT TIME PERIODBECAUSE NOW THAT FILM
IS EDUCATING LIKE YOUNGERPEOPLE ON WHAT HAPPENED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T KNOW. ANDIT'S ALSO RAISING THE
CONVERSATION OF LIKE WHAT,WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
AND OBVIOUSLY, ALL THESESITUATIONS HAPPENING IN AMERICA
ARE RAISING THE CONVERSATION.
>> Jon:  YOU MEAN THATRACISM IS OVER.
YEAH, IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S OVER.YEAH.
>> YEAH, YEAH. IS THAT WHATIT IS?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT,HUH?
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, IT JUST, ITJUST, WHAT IT IS, WE JUST
HAPPENED TO CATCH THE LAST,THE LAST ONE OF IT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: ON ANiPHONE. THAT'S ALL. JUST--
>> YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S THE LAST--THAT'S THE
END OF IT THE CREDITS GO RIGHTTHERE.
>> Jon: THE WAS THE LAST, THEYSAID, I THINK WHAT THE YOUNG
BOYS ON THE BUS WENT, "YOUKNOW WHAT, RACISM IS OVER BUT
LET'S JUST DO THE LAST ONE?
YOU GUYS TO WANT TO BE LAST?"
>> THAT WAS THE LASTSONG,
THAT WAS THE LAST SONG FORRACISM.
>> Jon:  THAT WAS THE LAST SONGFOR RACISM.
>> WE HOPE SO.
>> Jon:  YEAH, NO.
IT MUST BE ODD-- WHAT I ALWAYSFIND INTERESTING IS THAT THERE
IS THE MOVEMENT NOW TO TAKE THEINJURIES AND THE BITTERNESS OF
RACISM AND RETURN THEM TO WHITEPEOPLE, THE DOMINANT CULTURE,
THE MAJORITY CULTURE.
THERE'S A REAL ANGER, A REALVEIN OF ANGER OF LIKE,
HEY, MAN I DIDN'T HAVE SLAVES.
AND YOU'RE LIKE NO, NOTHAT'S BUT THEY'RE IS,
THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUTTHAT. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A
POWER STRUCTURE.
>> YEAH, WELL MY THING IS NOW ISLIKE HEY, WE ALL KNOW THERE'S
BEEN SOME BAD HISTORYIN OUR COUNTRY.
WE KNOW THAT RACISM EXISTS.
I'M, LIKE, SAYING, HEY, Y'ALL,I'M EXTENDING A HAND AND
I'M HOPING I THINK A LOT OF THEGENERATIONS IN DIFFERENT
CULTURES ARE SAYING, HEY,WE WANT TO GET PAST THIS.
WE'VE BEEN BULLIED, WE'VE BEENBEAT DOWN, BUT WE DON'T WANT IT
ANYMORE, AND WE'RE NOT EXTENDINGA FIST.
WE'RE NOT SAYING, HEY, YOU DIDTHIS, YOU DID US WRONG.
IT'S MORE LIKE, HEY, I'MEXTENDING MY HAND IN LOVE.
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE PAST ASMUCH AS WE CAN AND MOVE FROM
WHERE WE ARE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NOW HOW CAN WE HELP EACHOTHER?
YOU CAN TRY TO HELP US BECAUSEWE'RE GOING TO HELP OURSELVES,
TOO?
THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHTNOW.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon: HOW, HOW AND I THINKTHAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
AND I THINK-- I THINK THATDEFENSIVENESS FROM THE MAJORITY
CULTURE IS THE PART THAT-- ITHINK ALL IT WOULD TAKE IN THAT
INSTANCE IS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OFTHAT HAND, OF THAT INJURY, AND
TO SAY, "LOOK, I MAY NOT FEELNECESSARILY A PART OF THAT, BUT
I GET IT.">> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND THAT'S THE WAY TOMOVE FORWARD.
>> BUT THAT'S WHY I FEEL IT'SVERY IMPORTANT FOR US-- LIKE, ME
AS A BLACK MAN, I'M NOT SITTINGTHERE, LIKE, "HEY, WHITE PEOPLE,
YOU ALL DID US WRONG."
I MEAN, WE KNOW THAT THATEXISTED.
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO KEEPBRINGING THAT UP.
IT'S LIKE BEING IN ARELATIONSHIP AND CONTINUING
TO BRING UP THE PERSON'S ISSUES.NOW I'M SAYING,
"HEY, I LOVE YOU. LET'SMOVE PAST THIS." "COME ON,
BABY, LET'S GET PAST THIS." YOUKNOW?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  I KIND OF LIKETHAT.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING AMERICACOULD BE HEALED BY-- AND TELL
ME IF I'M PUTTING WORDS IN YOURMOUTH-- MAKE AN INCENSE CANDLE.
LOWER THE LIGHTS, A LITTLE BARRYWHITE MUSIC AND LET'S GET IT ON.
>> LET'S GET IT ON, MAN.
>> Jon: OKAY. WELL, I APPRECIATETHAT.
AND THE MOVIE, BY THE WAY,YOU GO FROM "SELMA" TO TRYING TO
KILL LIAM NIECEOM.
>> YES, IT'S A GREAT TRANSITION,MAN.
I MUST SAY.
AND THE MOVIE "RUN ALL NIGHT" ISINCREDIBLE.
IT'S LIKE, IT'S A GREATEXPERIENCE FOR ME,
BUT IT'S A GREAT LIKE FILM ASFAR AS JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE
CLASSIC GANGSTER FILMS THATREALLY HAS A RELATIONSHIP TO
IT.>> Jon: NOIR. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> AND IT MADE ME THINK OF,LIKE, "FRENCH CONNECTION" AND
"DOG DAY AFTERNOON".>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT WITH A LOT OF ACTION, ANDLIAM NEESON,
ME AND HIM GOING TOE TO TOE.
AND, OF COURSE, HE KICKS MY ASSA LITTLE AND I KICK HIS ASS A
LITTLE BUT IT WORKS OUT.
>> Jon: MY FAVORITE IS TO GO INAS AN ACTOR FROM ONE YEAR OF
NONVIOLENT PROTEST TO "I WILLKILL THAT MOTHER ( BLEEP )
FOR FREE." "RUN ALL NIGHT" IT'SIN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY.
IT'S COMMON!
