BUT FIRST, IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE APHONE DATA SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM -- WELL, MY CONDOLENCESTO YOU.
THIS IS NOT YOUR MONTH.
>> A FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT RULEDTHE CONTROVERSIAL N.S.A. PROGRAM
IS ILLEGAL THURSDAY.
>> THE COLLECTION OF BULK PHONEDATA AT THE N.S.A. EXCEEDS WHAT
WAS AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS ANDTHE PATRIOT ACT.
>> Jon: WOW!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW YOUR SURVEILLANCEPROGRAM HAS GONE TOO FAR WHEN
YOU CANNOT GET PERMISSION FROMTHE PATRIOT ACT!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S LIKE GETTING THROWN OUTOF AN OLIVE GARDEN FOR EATING
TOO MANY BREAD STICKS!
LISTEN, BUDDY. WE SAIDUNLIMITED, BUDDY, NOT INFINITY!
LOOK HOW GENUINELY UPSET ANDNAUSEOUS BOTH MEN LOOK!
(LAUGHTER)
ARE BREAD STICKS THAT (BLEEP)BIG?
(LAUGHTER)
THOSE LOOK MORE LIKE BREADREDWOODS.
THOSE ARE BIG.
IT'S LIKE A BAT.
ANYWAY, BACK TO SURVEILLANCE.
ACCORDING TO THE COURTS, THEGOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE
PERMISSION TO VACUUM UP CELLPHONE METADATA LIKE CELL
NUMBERS, LOCATIONS, CALL TIMESAND THE FREQUENCY WITH WICH
YOU USE THE EGGPLANT EMOJI AS ASTAND-IN FOR A PENIS.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TODO IT!
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
I KNOW IT'S SUPPSOED TO BE APENIS -- AND I SAY THIS AGAIN,
LIKE -- I'M NOT ON THE AIR MUCHLONGER AND I THINK I SHOULD
SHARE AS MUCH ABOUT MYSELFPOSSIBLE --
(LAUGHTER)
BUT -- MY PENIS IS CROWNED BYLITTLE GREEN CLOVER.
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME THING ONMY PENIS.
-- AND I WAS ALWAYS ASHAMEDUNTIL NOW.
NOW I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE.
WHERE DID THE COURT PLACE THECOLLECTION PROGRAM'S FATE?
WELL, THEY PLACED IT INCONGRESS' WRINKLY, ARTHRITIC,
GOD BOND-SCENTED HANDS.
YOU SEEE, THE PATRIOT ACTPROVISIONS RELATIVE TO THIS
PROGRAM EXPIRE JUNE 1, AND THESENATE NEEDS TO VOTE TO
EXTEND PATRIOT ACT.
HOW'S THAT GOING?
>> REPUBLICAN RAND PAUL HAS BEENTRYING TO BLOCK THE EXTENSION ON
CIVIL LIBERTIES GROUNDS.
HE FILIBUSTERED YESTERDAY FORNEARLY 11 HOURS.
>> Jon: NEARLY 11 HOURS!
SO CLOSE TO GETTING THE T-SHIRT.
YOU HAVE TO DO THE FULL, YOUHAVE TO DO THE FULL 11 HOURS.
BUT, HEY!
MAYBE WITH THE 11 HOURS, SENATORRAND PAUL MANAGED TO CHANGE SOME
MINDS.
>> WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AMOMENTOUS DEBATE.
THIS IS A DEBARE ABOUT WHETHEROR NOT A WARRANT WITH A SINGLE
NAME --
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELL!
WHY, RANDALL J. PAUL!
I DO DECLARE!
IF YOU DO NOT STOP THIS NONSENSEIMMEDIATELY!
WELL, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TOTAKE MY PUPILS AND ROTATE THEM
FROM ONE SIDE OF MY ORBITALSOCKET TWIXT TO THE OTHER!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT, RANDALL PAUL. LOOKUPON THE WHITES OF THE CORNER
OF MY EYE AND KNOW TAHT I AM SOOVER THIS!
(APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
THE FILIBUSTERSPEACH WAS METWITH A TOUCH OF SKEPTICISM, BUT
SURELY THERE ARE GOOD INTENTIONSBEHIND IT.
>> SENATOR McCAIN AND SENATORLINDSEY GRAHAM HAVE BOTH
SUGGESTED THAT THIS ISREVENUE-RAISING, THAT IT IS A
PERFORMANCE MORE THAN ASUBSTANTIVE EFFORT.
>> Jon: OF ALL THE BASE,PETTY, CYNICAL ACCUSATIONS, IT'S
NOT LIKE SENATOR RAND PAUL'SCAMPAIGN WEBSITE PUT OUT SOME
SORT OF FILIBUSTER PACK THATTHEY WERE SELLING --
OH, THEY DID, OH...
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT'S GOING A LITTLE FAR WITH"STAND THE RAND 2016 FILIBUSTER
CATHETER."
(LAUGHTER)
WAIT, I HAVE THE TAG TO IT!
DON'T JUMP THE GUN!
GIVE ME LIBER-PEE OR --
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT.
SO, OF COURSE, COME ON, MAN,WE'RE ON VACATION.
A COURT ALREADY SAID THEMETADATA COLLECTION PROGRAM GOES
FURTHER THAN THE PATRIOT ACTMANDATES.
THE PATRIOT ACT IS EXPIRINGJUNE 1, ANYWAY.
IT WAS PUT IN PLACE AFTERSEPTEMBER 11.
IT WAS ALWAYS DESIGNED TOEXPIRE.
WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW THE UNITEDSTATES GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO
INFRINGE UPON LIBERTY?
>> THE N.S.A.'S TELEPHONEMETADATA PROGRAM IS A CRITICAL
TOOL THAT OUR NATIONAL SECURITYPROFESSIONALS NEED TO KEEP US
SAFE.
>>  THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITYNEEDS THESE TOOLS TO PROTECT US.
>> LEGITIMATE TOOLS OFINTELLIGENCE --
>> IF THIS PROGRAM HAD EXISTEDBEFORE 9/11, AMERICAN LIVES
COULD'VE BEEN SAVED.
>> THE FOUNDERS MADE SURE THEFIRST OBLIGATION OF THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT WAS TO PROTECT THELIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
YOU CAN'T ENJOY YOUR CIVILLIBERTIES IF YOU'RE IN A COFFIN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: A STERN WARNING ABOUTCOFFINS FROM THE GUY WHO WON'T
LET NEW JERSEY PIGS TURNAROUND.
(APPLAUSE)
BY THE WAY -- TONIGHT'S SHOW --
TONIGHT'S SHOW IS BROUGHT TO YOUBY HOG GESTATION CRATES!
HOG GESTATION GRATES: THEY'RELIKE COFFINS FOR PIGS WHO ARE
STILL ALIVE.
BUT I GUESS THE LESSON IS SAVINGAMERICAN LIVES IS SOMETIMES MORE
IMPORTANT THAN CIVIL LIBERTIESAND GOVERNMENT OVERREACH.
YOU KNOW, UNLESS YOU'REOBVIOUSLY TRYING TO SAVE LIVES
BY PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE.
>> AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS ANUNPRECIDENTED OVERREACH.
>> AMERICANS AS A WHOLE ARE VERYUPSET ABOUT THE SIZE AND SCOPE
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
>> THIS MASSIVE GOVERNMENTINTERVENTION.
>> EXPENSIVE AND INTRUSIVE TOBLATANTLY IGNORE THE WILL OF THE
PEOPLE.
>> WE DON'T WANT POLITICIANSAND BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON
MAKING THE MOST INTIMATEDECISIONS WE FACE IN OUR LIVES
ABOUT HEALTHCARE.
>> Jon: WE ONLY WANT TO COLLECTPHONE CALLS TO THE DOCTORS WHILE
THEY'RE SCHEDULING THESEINTIMATE DECISIONS.
I GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSEGOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE
OVERREACH IS BAD BECAUSECOMPARED TO TERRORISM,
ONE IS A CLEAR AND PRESENTDANGER.
>> A 2009 HARVARD STUDYESTIMATED THAT 45,000 PEOPLE DIE
EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THEY DON'THAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.
>> Jon: 45,000 PEOPLE A YEAR.
(BLEEP)!
(LAUGHTER)
HOW DO WE MAKE THAT THE THINGTHE GOVERNMENT CARES ABOUT?
DO WE HAVE TO RENAME TYPE TWODIABETES OSAMA BIN UNABLE
TO PROCESS INSILIN.
(LAUGHTER)
SO I GUESS WHILE WE NEED THEPATRIOT ACT IN ITS PRESENT
FORM, THE GOVERNMENT ISOVERSTEPPING AUTHORITY.
SO WE HAVE TO FIX IT,PREFERRABLY IN A WAY THAT REINS
IN SOME OF ITS EXCESSES, BUTDOESN'T MAKE US SOUND LIKE
WIMPY, UNAMERICAN BABIES.
>> I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OFTHE USA FREEDOM ACT.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT.
THE U.S.A. FREEDOM ACT.
JUST THE NAME IS THELEGISTALTIVE EQUIVALENT OF
WICKED GUITAR SOLO OR BALLSHANGING FROM YOUR TRUCK.
IT'S PERFECT!
>> IT STANDS FOR THE UNITING ANDSTRENGTHENING OF AMERICA BY
FULFILLING RIGHTS AND ENDINGEAVESDROPPING
DRAGNET-COLLECTION, AND ONLINEMONITORING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU KNOW?
IN THE 14-YEAR HISTORY OF THEWAR ON TERROR, WE'VE HEARD ABOUT
GUANTANAMO, WATER BOARDINGRENDITION, ABU GHRAIB.
NOTHING HAS BEEN MORE TORTUREDTHAN THAT ACRONYM.
WELL, AT LEAST THE FREEDOM ACTFIXED THE GOVERNMENT METADATA
ISSUE.
>> THE U.S.A. FREEDOM ACT INEFFECT WOULD GO BACK TO THE
STATUS QUO.
>> THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES HOLDTHE DATA AND PUT ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS ON THEADMINISTRATION TO SEARCH FOR THE
HAYSTACK, BUT WILL ALLOW THEHAYSTACK TO CONTINUE.
>> Jon: OH, IT DOESN'T GET RIDOF THE HAYSTACK.
WELL, I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTERWHAT WE CALL THE METADATA,  WE
NEED TO COLLECT THE METADATABECAUSE THAT'S BEEN KEEPING
US SAFE AND THWARTING TERRORISMPLOTS.
>> JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS AND THEINSPECTOR GENERAL THIS WEEK
ISSUED A REPORT THAT SAYS THEF.B.I. CAN'T REPORT TO A SINGLE
TERRORIST PLOT THAT WAS BROKENUP AS A RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM.
>> Jon: OKAY.
SO BASICALLY IT BOILS DOWN TO ASENATE DEBATE BETWEEN THOSE WHO
SAY WE MUST GIVE UP LIBERTY TOKEEP US SAFE, EVEN THOUGH IT
DOESN'T, AND THOSE WHO BELIEVEWE MUST PROTECT OUR LIBERTIES,
EVEN THOUGH THEY WON'T.
OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY,BRING ME MY FAINTIN' COUCH!
(APPLAUSE)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
