COMEDY CENTRAL
[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BIG ONE TONIGHT.
OH, YEAH, BABY.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON STEWART, HOST
OF "THE DAILY SHOW" IN 2011.
AND YET I'VE BEEN IN THE
BUSINESS FOR OVER 20 YEARS, SO
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT I'VE
DONE THAT YOU COULD MENTION.
[LAUGHTER]
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I FEEL LIKE THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT
JUST LOOKED ME UP ON WIKIPEDIA.
WHEN THEY'RE ASKING ME
QUESTIONS.
YOU WERE IN ELMO PALOOZA 2002.
ON THE SHOW TONIGHT, TREY PARKER
AND MATT STONE.
NO, NO!
YOU KNOW WHAT, MATT STONE AND
TREY PARKER ARE ON THE SHOW.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT ENDS TONIGHT.
EARLIER THIS WEEK, EARLIER THIS
WEEK WHILST REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES SPARRED OVER WHO BEST
COULD EVEN SLIGHTLY DELAY THE
INEVITABLE DECAY OF AMERICA INTO
A GAY, ISLAMIC CALIFANT,
PRESIDENT OBAMA FULFILLED A
CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO RETURN TO
THE ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO,
THOUGH LIKE MOST NEW YORKERS, I
ASSUMED IT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S
WAY OF TRYING TO AVOID THE
TRAFFIC FROM SUNDAY'S PUERTO
RICAN DAY PARADE.
WORST DRIVING KAY OF THE YEAR,
ASIDE FROM OBVIOUSLY ST.
PATRICK'S DAY AND THE GAY PRIDE
PARADE, AND, OF COURSE, THE
TRAFFIC DAY PARADE THAT.
IS THE WORST OF THE... WHY WOULD
YOU HAVE A PARADE CELEBRATING...
OKAY.
[LAUGHTER]
OBAMA'S TRIP MARKED FIRST
OFFICIAL VISIT TO PUERTO RICO BY
A SITTING PRESIDENT SINCE JOHN
F. KENNEDY, AND HIS FAMOUS
SPEECH 50 YEARS AGO, "ESTOY EIN
PUERTO RICAN, UH, OR SAN JUANA,
UH."
CLEARLY THIS WOULD BE AN
HISTORIC OCCASION.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SPENDING
ABOUT FIVE HOURS IN THE U.S.
TERRITORY.
>> Jon: OH, FIVE HOURS.
WELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS
ISN'T REALLY A PRESIDENTIAL
VISIT, MORE OF A LAYOVER ON HIS
WAY TO ST. BART'S, BUT NO
HISTORIC FIVE-HOUR STATE VISIT
WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A
STIRRING ADDRESS AND N A
FLAG-DRAPED AIRPORT HANGAR JUST
FEET FROM THE STILL-IDLING PLANE
THE PRESIDENT JUST LANDED IN.
>> IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN
PUERTO RICO.
>> Jon: QUE BUENO.
BARACK OBAMA, QUE BUENO, PUERTO
RICO.
ADDED SOME SPICY PRONUNCIATION.
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BE
ABLE TO KEEP THAT UP.
>> OUR HEALTH CARE REFORM
INCLUDED HELP FROM PUERTO RICO.
THESE PROBLEMS DIDN'T DEVELOP
OVER NIGHT HERE IN PUERTO RICO,
HERE IN PUERTO RICO.
HERE IN PUERTO RICO AND ALL
ACROSS AMERICA.
>> Jon: THERE YOU GO, FOLKS.
"PUERTO" TO "PORTO" IN JUST
UNDER EIGHT MINUTES.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP UP THE
"PUERTO," YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE
HABIT OF SAYING PARROTS PATIENT
ALL THE TIME.
"PUERTO POTTY."
I WILL PICK YOU UP AT THE "PUERT
AUTHORITY."
OF COURSE, THE ACT SENGTD
PRONUNCIATION ON THEIR HOME
ISLAND IS NOT THE ONLY TRICK
ROLLED UP THE PRESIDENT'S
SLEEVE.
>> EVERY BORIQUAS IS HERE.
MARC ANTHONY SHOWED UP TODAY.
EVEN IN THE NBA FINALS JJ BAREA
IS DOING GOOD ON THE HOOPS.
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE
IS AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE, OR
AS ARROZ CON GANDULES.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HE NAILED THAT ONE,
HUH?
HE HAD TO CHECK HIS PAPER THREE
TIMES ON THAT ONE.
ARROZ...
CON...
[LAUGHTER]
[BLEEPED]
GANDULES.
ALL RIGHT.
SO HE NAILED IT.
WHAT'S NEXT?
>> NOW THE PRESIDENT LEFT ABOUT
AN HOUR EARLIER THAN EXPECTED SO
HE SPENT A TOTAL OF FOUR HOURS
HERE.
>> Jon: FOUR HOURS.
SEE, THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO
WHEN YOU DON'T BRING BIDEN
ALONG.
YOU CAN JUST GET IN AND OUT AND
SALE TEAM SIX THAT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND TIME
SITTING ON THE TARMAC WHILE OLD
J.P. GOES BO DEREK.
SEVEN HOURS ON A PLANE TO SPEND
FOUR HOURS IN PUERTO RICO.
THE PRESIDENT MUST BE REALLY
DRIVEN TO FULFILL ALL OF HIS OLD
CAMPAIGN PROMISES.
OR...
>> THE 11 STATES WITH THE
HIGHEST PUERTO RICAN POPULATION
ALSO HAVE MOST OF THE ELECTORAL
VOTES HE WOULD NEED TO BE
REELECTED.
>> I MEAN, FLORIDA WOULD
PROBABLY BE THE BIGGEST PRIZE
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS EYES
ON.
OF COURSE, ALWAYS A
BATTLEGROUND.
847,000 PUERTO RICANS.
YOU LOOK AT STATES LIKE NEW
JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, OTHER KEY
BATTLEGROUNDS, 366,000 PUERTO
RICANS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ANYONE ELSE WEIRDED
OUT ABOUT JUST HOW "RAIN MAN"
SPECIFIC ED HENRY'S NUMBER OF
PUERTO RICANS IN AMERICA
KNOWLEDGE IS?
[AS ED HENRY]: "THEN THE
PRESIDENT LANDED AT DULLES
AIRPORT, EMPLOYER OF 78 PUERTO
RICANS.
[LAUGHTER]
HEADED BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
PASSING 3,700 PUERTO RICANS.
IN HIS 22-MINUTE DRIVE.
I HAVE THEIR NAMES."
