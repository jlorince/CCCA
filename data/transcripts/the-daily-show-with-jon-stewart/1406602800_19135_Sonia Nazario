MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THEPULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR OF
"ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY, THE STORYOF A BOY'S DANGEROUS ODYSSEY TO
REUNITE WITH HIS MOTHER."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMSONIA NAZARIO.
HELLO.
NICE SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY WE'D LOVE TOSAY THAT THIS SITUATION HAS
GOTTEN BETTER SINCE THE TIME OFTHIS VERY ACCLAIMED "ENRIQUE'S
JOURNEY."
WHEN, WHEN DID YOU, DID YOUWRITE THIS, ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO?
>> YEAH, I WENT TO HONDURAS 13AND TEN YEARS AGO...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND WAS WRITING ABOUT, YOUKNOW, THESE WOMEN WHO COME HERE,
SINGLE MOTHERS, LEAVE THEIRCHILDREN BEHIND IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, MEXICO, AND THECHILDREN WHO FOLLOW THEM AND
MAKE THIS MODERN-DAY ODYSSEY ONTOP OF FREIGHT TRAINS TO COME
SEARCHING FOR THEIRMOTHERS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I WROTE ABOUT IT THROUGHTHE STORY OF ONE BOY WHO DOES
THIS. HE DOESN'T SEE HIS MOM FOR11 YEARS. SHE LEAVE HIM WHEN
HE'S FIVE YEARS OLD.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND AFTER 11 YEARS HE'SDESPERATE TO BE WITH HER, AND HE
MAKES THIS INCREDIBLE JOURNEY ONTOP OF FREIGHT TRAINS.
>> Jon: DANGER AND FILLEDWITH BEATINGS AND VIOLENCE AND
ALL KINDS OF TERRIBLE THINGSHAPPEN TO THESE KIDS AS THEY'RE
MAKING THIS JOURNEY.
>> YEAH, INCREDIBLE DANGER.
I, I DID THE JOURNEY FOR THREEMONTHS ON TOP OF FREIGHT
TRAINS TO WRITE ABOUT WHATTHIS IS LIKE. AND THEY FACE
BANDITS ALONGSIDE THERAILS, GANGS THAT I WOULD SEE
CONTROLLING THE TRAIN TOPS,ROAMING FROM CAR TO CAR...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> RAPING, KILLING THESECHILDREN.
>> Jon: TERRIBLE.
>> I RODE WITH A 12-YEAR-OLDBOY. THERE WERE
7-YEAR-OLD BOYS MAKING THISJOURNEY ALONE ACROSS
FOUR COUNTRIES COMING IN SEARCHOF THEIR PARENTS.
>> Jon: AND THIS, FOR THE MOSTPART BACK THEN, THE ISSUE WAS
POVERTY.
>> POVERTY AND REUNITING WITHTHE PARENT.
>> Jon: AND REUNITING WITH THEPARENT...
>> YES.
>> Jon: BUT THE PARENT HADGONE FOR POVERTY.
HOW HAS THE CONDITION CHANGED INHONDURAS NOW?
>> WELL, SO I WENT BACK TOHONDURAS...
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> TO THIS BOY'SNEIGHBORHOOD LAST MONTH...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I WAS JUST SHOCKED BYTHE CHANGE THAT I SAW, ENORMOUS
GROWTH IN VIOLENCE BECAUSE,YOU KNOW, THERE WERE GANGS BACK
THEN, BUT NOW IN THE LAST FEWYEARS, THESE NARCO CARTELS,
WE'VE, WE STOPPED THE FLOW OFCOCAINE FROM COLOMBIA UP THE
CARIBBEAN TO THE UNITED STATES.WE SPENT $8 BILLION TO DO THAT,
BUT IT SIMPLY REROUTEDINLAND TO HONDURAS.
SO ALL THESE COCAINE FLIGHTSGOING TO THE U.S. LAND THERE,
AND THESE NARCO CARTELS, MOSTLYMEXICAN, ARE REALLY FIGHTING FOR
CONTROL OVER THIS TURF.
AND THESE CHILDREN HAVE BECOMETHEIR FOOT SOLDIERS.
>>Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THEY'RE TRYING TO RECRUITTHESE CHILDREN AT A VERY YOUNG
AGE TO USE DRUGS, DISTRIBUTEDRUGS, SERVE AS LOOKOUTS AND
ULTIMATELY SERVE AS HITMEN FORTHESE CARTELS.
SO THEY HAD A GRIP ON HISNEIGHBORHOOD NOW, AND CHILDREN
LIVING IN JUST ENORMOUS FEAR,HAD BEEN THREATENED MULTIPLE
TIMES BY THE TIME THEY WERE 11YEARS OLD.
>> Jon: AND NOW THESE KIDS,SO, SO THIS IS THE SITUATION
WE'RE IN NOW WITH 40,000 KIDS,45,000 KIDS THAT HAVE COME UP
FROM CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAS
BEEN INUNDATED WITH THESE TURFWARS, THESE DRUG TURF WARS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND THEY GET TO OURBORDER, AND WE DO WHAT?
>> WELL, I THINK WE NEED TO SEETHESE CHILDREN FOR WHAT THEY
ARE.
THEY ARE REFUGEES.
THEY ARE FLEEING... AN IMMIGRANTWHO COMES HERE FOR ECONOMIC
REASONS, FOR A BETTER LIFE...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE TODEPORT THAT PERSON.
I'M NOT AN OPEN-BORDERS GAL, BUTTHESE CHILDREN, AND I TALKED TO
AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO SAID, YOUKNOW, THEY ARE BEATING ME IN MY
SCHOOL TRYING TO FORCE ME TO USEDRUGS.
I KNOW THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVEBEEN KILLED THIS YEAR.
MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THESE12-YEAR-OLD NARCOS SHOW UP AND
THEY SAY, ALL OF THESE KIDS HAVETO GO WITH ME, THESE
TEN-YEAR-OLDS, TO DISTRIBUTECRACK IN MY SCHOOL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THESE CHILDREN ARE FLEEINGFOR THEIR LIVES, AND I THINK
IT'S REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARYMOMENT FOR US TO STAND UP AND DO
THE RIGHT THING FOR THESECHILDREN.
>> Jon: AND WHY IS IT SO HARD TODO THAT? YOU KNOW, IT'S...
[APPLAUSE]YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THESE
IMMIGRANTS, I, I, THIS IS,YOU KNOW, MAY BE A BIT OF
A RIGHT TURN, BUT I SPENTA LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN
JORDAN LAST SUMMER. THIS IS ACOUNTRY WITH IT MUST
HAVE BEEN SIX MILLIONPEOPLE IN IT.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE INTERMS OF RESOURCES, WATER, OIL,
THEY DON'T HAVE IN THAT COUNTRY.
REFUGEES ARE POURING IN BY THEHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FROM
SYRIA, FROM IRAQ, AND THEY DOEVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO
GIVE THOSE PEOPLE REFUGE ANDASYLUM.
>> AND WE TELL THEM TO.
>> Jon: AND WHY, AND WE LINE UPAT THE BORDER AND YELL AT THEM.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: SO IT'S,  I THINK IT'SEMBARRASSING FOR OUR COUNTRY.
>> IT IS EMBARRASSING. I MEAN,
I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE USEDTHESE SIX YEAR OLDS AS PUNCHING
BAGS AHEAD OF THE PRIMARYPLAYING TO THEIR BASE, SAYING
THAT THESE KIDS ARE CRIMINALSAND THEY'RE CARRYING EBOLA.
AND THEY'RE SIMPLY PLAYING TOTHE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR,
THESE ANTI-IMMIGRANT FEELINGS,AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, INSTEAD OF
SAYING, LET'S GIVE THESE KIDS AREAL DUE PROCESS, LET'S LET THEM
GO TO COURT AND SEE IF THEY'REREFUGEES.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WHICH IS THE LAW,BY THE WAY, THE 2008 LAW THAT...
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNEDWAS THAT IF YOU COME FROM
CENTRAL AMERICA AND YOU'RESEEKING ASYLUM, YOU ARE, YOU ARE
OWED DUE PROCESS.
>> AND SHAME ON HIM FOR TRYINGTO CHANGE THAT LAW.
BECAUSE HE'S TRYING EXPEDITETHEIR REMOVAL.
>> Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TOCHANGE THAT LAW SO THESE KIDS
ARE NOT GIVEN THEIR FAIR DAY INCOURT WHERE THEY CAN ARGUE
WHETHER THEY'RE REFUGEES OR NOT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN AFULL, FAIR HEARING WITH AN
ATTORNEY BY THEIRSIDE. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IN THESE
COURTROOMS, YOU KNOW, WEALLOW MURDERERS IN THIS COUNTRY,
WE PROVIDE THEM WITH A PUBLICDEFENDER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT AN IMMIGRANT CHILD IS NOTPROVIDED WITH THAT.
AND SO MANY OF THEM CAN'T AFFORDAN ATTORNEY.
>> Jon: WHAT DOES A SIX YEAROLD WHO ONLY SPEAKS SPANISH NEED
WITH AN ATTORNEY?
I'M SURE OUR COURT SYSTEM WILLSORT IT ALL OUT.
>> YEAH. I'M SURE THEY CAN, THEYCAN PRESENT A COMPLEX
IMMIGRATION CASEALL BY THEMSELVES.
RIGHT?
NO PROBLEM.
>> Jon: IS THERE, IS THERE AHUMANITARIAN MOMENTUM BUILDING
TO BEGIN TO STATES SAYING,LOOK, WE'LL STEP IN, WE
WILL HOUSE THEM OR AT LEAST GIVETHEM REASONABLE
LIVING CONDITIONS UNTIL THISCAN BE SORTED OUT?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE SEENTHE GRASSROOTS, MANY
ACTUALLY CHRISTIAN, EVANGELICAL,BAPTIST GROUPS...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT HAVE REALLY STOOD UP ANDSAID, WE CAN HELP
THESE CHILDREN IN THESEDETENTION FACILITIES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHTTHING.
BUT I THINK ON A POLITICALLEVEL, THESE CHILDREN ARE BEING
USED AS FOOTBALLS AND MANYPEOPLE ARE SAYING, HOW FAST CAN
WE GET RID OF THEM.
AND THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TOPUSH MEXICO AND GUATEMALA TO
STOP THESE CHILDREN, TOBASICALLY SEAL THEM INTO THESE
COUNTRIES WHERE MANY OFTHESE CHILDREN FACE DEATH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE WITHTHESE CHILDREN.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY HAVE BEEN THREATENEDMULTIPLE TIMES.
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO SEETHESE CHILDREN NOT AS AN
IMMIGRATION ISSUE, BUT AS AREFUGEE ISSUE,
>> Jon: REFUGEE ISSUE, YEAH.
>> LIKE WE DID WITH CUBANS, LIKEWE HAVE WITH HAITIANS.
THERE HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARYMOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY WHERE WE
HAVE STOOD UP AND SAID, WE NEEDTO DO THE RIGHT THING.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITHTHESE KIDS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THE RIGHT THING.
THE RIGHT THING.
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN A WHILE,HAVE WE?
"ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY" IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEINGHERE.
SONIA NAZARIO.>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
