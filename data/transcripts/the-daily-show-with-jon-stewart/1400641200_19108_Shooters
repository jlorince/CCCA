(LAUGHTER)OF COURSE, CHIPOTLE'S ASSAULT ON
ASSAULT RIFLES IS JUST ONE PARTOF A LARGER ATTACK ON FIREARMS
SUPPORTERS, AS MARYLAND GUNSTORE OWNER ANDY RAYMOND LEARNED
WHEN HE WAS TARGETED BYEXTREMISTS JUST FOR TRYING TO
SELL GUNS.
>> ONE CALLER WARNED RAYMOND'SBUSINESS WOULD BE BURNED TO THE
GROUND AND ANOTHERTHREATENED RAYMOND WOULD
GET WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM.
>> SO, ANYWAY, OBVIOUSLY IRECEIVED NUMEROUS DEATH THREATS
TODAY.
I REALLY [BLEEP] APPRECIATE IT.
IT WAS [BLEEP] CLASSY.
>> Jon: FOR THE RECORD, THEDEATH THREATS HE RECEIVED,
THEY WERE REALLY (BLEEP) CLASSY.THEY WERE GLOSS EMBOSSED,
80 POUND PAPER,VERY THICK. LOOK, I SUPPORT
REASONABLE GUN SAFETY MEASURESAS MUCH AS THE OTHER 90% OF ALL
AMERICANS, BUT THERE'S "NO"EXCUSE FOR ANTI-GUN PEOPLE TO
THREATEN ANYONE.
>> THE HATE MAIL WASN'T FROMANTI-GUN FOLKS BUT FROM GUN
OWNERS ACCUSING ANDY OF BEINGA GUN RIGHTS TRAITOR FOR BEING
WILLING TO SELL A WEAPON SOMEOWNERS SEE AS
THREAT TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
>> WHAT THE (BLEEP).
WHAT KIND OF GUN IS A THREATTO THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
A GUN THAT SHOOTS OTHER GUNS?
A GUN THAT GOES BACK IN TIME ANDKILLS AMENDMENTS?
>> A NEW WEAPON CALLED THESMARTGUN USES COMPUTER
TECHNOLOGY THAT PREVENTS ANYONEOTHER THAN THE GUN'S OWNER FROM
SHOOTING.
>> MADE IN GERMANY, IT REQUIRESUSERS TO WEAR A RADIO-CONTROLLED
WATCH TO FIRE IT.
>> BELINDA LEADS THE AMERICANDIVISION OF ARMATEX. SHE MET ME
AT A MARYLAND GUN RANGE.
>> SO, RED MEANS YOU ARE NOT THEAUTHORIZED USER.
>> PUTTING THE AMMUNITION IN.
I CAN FIRE."
>> WOW, THAT'S LIKE SOMETHINGI NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD LIVE TO
SEE,AN MSNBC HOST AT A SHOOTING
RANGE!
(LAUGHTER)BUT THIS SMART GUN SOUNDS GOOD,
TOO!
IT PROTECTS YOUR HOME, IT DOESYOUR KID'S ALGEBRA, AND
IT CAN'T BE TURNED AGAINST YOU.
WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT?
>> NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THENIGHT WHEN SOMEBODY BREAKS IN,
BEFORE I CAN SHOOT MY GUN,"WHERE'S MY BRACELET!?
I'VE GOT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS!"(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YEAH!
(BLEEP) YEAH!
NO, THAT DOES SEEM LIKE AN AWFULLOT OF HASSLE TO GO THROUGH
BEFORE GETTING TO SHOOT SOMEONE.
IT'S SO ONEROUS.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,REACH WITH MY GUN WITH THIS HAND
AND USE MY OTHER HANDTO GET THIS OTHER THING?
IT'S A [BLEEP] WRIST BAND,IT'S NOT A VICTORIAN CORSET!
HOLD ON!
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT A SMARTGUN, DON'T BUY THEM.
HOW IS THIS A SECOND AMENDMENTTHREAT?
>> IN 2002, NEW JERSEY PASSED ALAW REQUIRING THAT ONCE A SMART
GUN GOES ON THE MARKET ANYWHEREIN THE COUNTRY, GUN SELLERS IN
NEW JERSEY MUST MOVE WITHINTHREE YEARS TO ONLY SELL SMART
GUNS, TAKING TRADITIONAL GUNSOFF THE SHELVES.
>> Jon: WHOA...
POINT, GUN NUTS.
UNLESS ONCE THAT NEW JERSEYLAW'S SPONSOR REALIZED HER LAW
WAS NOT MAKING "ALL" GUNS SAFER,BUT PREVENTING "ANY"
SAFE GUN FROM BEING SOLD, ANDSHE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.
>> NEW JERSEY STATE SENATEMAJORITY LEADER LORETTA WEINBERG
IS OFFERING TO REPEAL A GUN LAWSHE SPONSORED 12 YEARS AGO IF
THE NRA AGREES TO STOP ITSOPPOSITION TO SMART GUNS.
>> Jon: YES!
IT'S A WIN-WIN!
EVERYONE IS HOLDING HANDS ANDSINGING "GUN-BAYA!"
(LAUGHTER)IT'S LIKE KUMBAYA BUT WITH
SHOOTING.
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR --N.R.A., THIS IS A
DEAL WHERE NEW JERSEY WILLREPEAL A GUN CONTROL LAW IF, IN
RETURN, YOU CONSENT TO LETPEOPLE SELL "MORE" GUNS!
IT'S LIKE YOUR WET DREAM.
I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW HOWPRO-CHOICE YOU ARE GUN-WISE.
>> THE FACT IS WE BELIEVE INFREE MARKETS AND FREE CHOICE.
THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY ISABOUT.
>> THERE IS NO GREATER FREEDOMTHAN THE RIGHT TO SURVIVE AND
PROTECT OUR FAMILIES WITH ALLTHE RIFLES, SHOTGUNS AND
HANDGUNS WE WANT.
>> Jon: SO IT'S A DEAL!
>> THE NRA FOR ITS PART IS NOTSHOWING ANY SIGNS IT WILL BACK
OFF ITS TOUGH STANCE AGAINST THESMART GUNS.
>> Jon: HOLY (BLEEP)!FINALLY, THE N.R.A.'S FIGHT TO
PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENTHAS MET ITS MATCH -- THE N.R.A.!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
