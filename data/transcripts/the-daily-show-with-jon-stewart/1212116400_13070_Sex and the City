>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SHOW.
NOW OCCASIONALLY WE COVER
THE TOPIC -- OCCASIONALLY WE
COVER THE TOPIC OF
REPRODUCTION OR SEX AS WELL
AS THAT OF OUR NATIVE LOCALE
OF THE CITY.
BUT IT ALL TOO RARE THAT
HISTORY OFFERS US A
JUXTAPOSITION OF BOTH TOPICS.
[BLEEP] LET'S JUST START THE
VIBE RA PHONE.
YES, THE LONG ANTICIPATED
"SEX AND THE CITY" MOVIE
OPENS THIS WEEK.
SAMANTHA BEE WAS AT THE NEW
YORK PREMIER AND JOINS US
NOW.
SAM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: EXCITING.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: IT'S QUITE A
PHENOMENON.
>> YES.
>> Jon: QUITE A PHENOMENON,
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY FOR
ONE MOVIE.
HOW WAS IT?
>> OKAY, HONESTLY, JON, I
DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.
I MEAN I KNOW EVERYONE IS
EXCITED ABOUT THE MOVIE.
AND FROM THE PREMIER --
PREVIEW -- PREVIEWS I
EXPECTED IT TO BE SOME SORT
OF DRAMA ABOUT FOUR
MIDDLE-AGED ALCOHOLICS WHO
SPEND THEIR TIME WEARING
CRAZE CLOTHES AND WALKING
PLACES IN A LINE.
AND I GUESS ON THAT FRONT,
IT DELIVERED.
BUT I HAD NO IDEA THERE
WOULD BE SUCH A SAMUEL
BECKETT VIBE TO THE WHOLE
THING.
I MEAN THEY TALK ABOUT MEN
FOR OVER TWO HOURS, BUT THEN
IN THE END THEY DECIDE THEY
ARE HAPPIER JUST HAVING LADY
FRIENDSING LOTS OF MONEY AND
ALCOHOL.
AH, SO DEPRESSING.
SORT OF LIKE A NO EXIT WITH
FEATHERED HATS.
>> Jon: NOT REALLY ALL THAT
YOU EXPECTED.
>> OH MY GOD!
NO.
AND HERE IS ANOTHER SURPRISE,
JON.
DID YOU REALIZE THE CITY IN
THE TITLE IS ACTUALLY
SUPPOSED TO BE NEW YORK
CITY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I THINK PRETTY MUCH
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT, SAM.
>> OH, REALLY?
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN HERE SIX
YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANY ONE EVEN REMOTELY LIKE
THAT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME
FICTIONAL TOWN LIKE
SHALLOWSBURG OR BALANCE A
WHORE OR FILL -- OR AND THE
GAY THING, ONE OF THE WOMEN
STARTS OUT ENGAGED RIGHT AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE
TO THIS GUY THEY CALL BIG
WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION.
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CARE?
WE DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE
CHARACTERS AND THEIR HISTORY,
HELLO.
A LITTLE BACKGROUND HERE.
-- LIKE IT I WAS WATCHING
SEX AND THE CITY II.
>> Jon: SAM, YOU ARE AWARE
THIS IS BASED ON A
TELEVISION SHOW?
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT?
>> Jon: A VERY POPULAR SHOW,
RAN FOR SIX SEASON, ONE OF
THE BIGGEST HITS HBO EVER
HAD.
IT WAS --
>> OOOHHH!
OH, THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS?
I FLIPPED PAST IT A COUPLE
OF TIMES BUT I THOUGHT IT
WAS JUST TAXI CAB
CONFESSIONS WITH BETTER
LIGHTING.
WEIRD.
>> Jon: SO NOTHING, IT
DIDN'T -- I MEAN I FEEL
STUPID.
WE SENT YOU THERE BECAUSE I
THOUGHT THE ISN'T MATTER WAS
APPELING TO YOUR AGE GROUP
AND DEMOGRAPHIC AND STUFF.
>> OH, ME?
(LAUGHTER)
>> NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE CONFUSING ME WITH MY
HUSBAND JASON.
HE IS SUCH A CHARLOTTE.
I THINK I ACTUALLY HAVE A
CLIP.
>> SORRY I'M LATE, ALWAYS
HAVING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
AND I COMPLETELY LOST TRACK
OF TIME.
>> INSERT SMALL GENITALIA.
>> I'M SO -- SAM.
>> ONE OF THOSE NECKTIES.
>> THIS WAS A $600 NECKTIE.
>> OH, I SHOULD HAD A
NECKTIE-GASM.
>> TO --
>> VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.
>> I [BLEEP]
