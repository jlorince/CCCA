OBVIOUSLY IT IS STILL VERY
EARLY IN THE EVENING, BUT
CERTAINLY THIS NIGHT IS PLAYING
OUT ACCORDING TO BARACK OBAMA'S
GAME PLAN.
NOW, STEPHEN...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU HAVE SOME NUMBERS, BIG
FAN OF GAME PLANS.
YOU HAVE TRACKING NUMBERS ON
SOME OF THE REMAINING BELLWETHER
STATES.
>> I CERTAINLY DO, JON, AND I
WILL GET TO THAT IN JUST A
MOMENT.
BUT FIRST BREAKING NEWS, IT
APPEARS THAT THIS ELECTION DAY
ACROSS THE NATION WE ARE GETTING
REPORTS ON SOME WONDERFUL LADIES
TURNING 100 YEARS YOUNG TODAY.
LADIES LIKE CLAIRE VAN RYAN
OF WILFORD, TENNESSEE WHO IS
DOING THE BIRTHDAY DO.
CREDITS HER PEP TO LONG WALKS
THREE SERVINGS OF MEAT AT
BREAKFAST.
NEXT IS MARILYN CLAIRE OF
VERMONT.
MARILYN IS A BIT OF A
DRINKER, BUT SHE STILL PACKS HER
OWN SHOTGUN SHELLS.
I SALUTE THE TWO LADIES WITH
THE EXTREME TASTE OF MOUNTAIN
DEW BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY
SUSCEPTIBLE TO OSTEOPOROSIS!
>> Jon: LOOK, YOU MADE THESE
LADIES UP, DIDN'T YOU?
>> Stephen: THEY ARE COMPOSITE
CHARACTERS, JON, BUT I THINK I
CAPTURED IN A SENSE A TRUTH.
>> Jon: STEPHEN, I KNOW THIS IS
NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY NIGHT
FOR YOU, BUT, PLEASE LET'S JUST
DO THE RESULTS, NO MORE
STALLING.
>> Stephen: IN A MINUTE, JON,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP OUR
GUEST WAITING.
JERRY HERE WITH WILDLIFE
EXPERT WHO BROUGHT ALONG SOME
FUNNY AND FURY FRIENDS.
NOW, WHAT THE-- WHAT KIND OF
ANIMAL DO WE HAVE HERE, JERRY?
>> THIS IS A COCKATOO
>> Stephen: A COCKATOO?
CAN YOU EVEN SAY THAT ON TV?
>> HA, HA.
>> Jon: JESUS CHRIST, I DON'T
THINK COCKATOOS, SUCK IT UP, BE
A MAN!
EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT IS
HAPPENING, REPORT WHAT IS A VERY
CUTE BIRD, REPORT WHAT IS
HAPPENING.
>> Stephen: OKAY.
JON, LET ME PUT THIS GUY UP HERE
ON MY SHOULDER, OKAY?  AND YOU
KNOW WHILE YOU ARE UP THERE,
ROSCOE, YOU COULD CUT MY THROAT
TO MAKE THESE FEELINGS END.
>> Jon: STEPHEN, LET'S JUST GET
TO SOME UPDATES I WANT TO GET TO
BIG, BIG RESULTS THAT ARE COMING
IN.
THE FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
IS THE STATE OF OHIO.
THE STATE OF OHIO...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FOR BARACK OBAMA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BARACK OBAMA HAS WON THE
STATE OF OHIO.
NO REPUBLICAN EVER WON THE
WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT OHIO, BUT
THE OXYGEN BUT THE PUNDITS WON'T
JIB JAB ABOUT THAT.
>> Stephen: WHY WOULD ZERO HIGH
ZERO ANES WOULD GO FOR A KNOWN
SOCIALIST?
WAIT A SECOND THAT IS OHIO'S
FLAG, PUT UP CUBA'S FLAG, I KNEW
IT.
LET ME DO NEW YORK AS WELL.
NEW YORK HAS GONE FOR BARACK
OBAMA 72%.
NEW YORK CLEARLY ONCE AGAIN NOT
UNDERSTANDING THE DANGER IT IS
FROM TERRORISTS.
THIS IS NO SURPRISE, JON,
MCCAIN WAS NEVER GOING TO WIN
NEW YORK THE CITY THAT NEVER
SLEEPS WILL NOT SUPPORT A MAN
THAT GOES TO BED AT 7:30.
>> Jon: THAT IS PROBABLY RIGHT.
ANYMORE NEWS?
>> Stephen: YES, JON.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN,
BARACK OBAMA HAS WON
PENNSYLVANIA.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THIS IS A PERSONAL
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME AND
ROSCOE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND... WHY GIVE
PEOPLE GUNS OR RELIGION IF THEY
WILL NOT CLING TO THEM?
MAYBE THAT WAS THE ISSUE.
THEY GOT THE GUNS IN THE ONE
HAND AND THE RELIGION IN THE
OTHER AND WHAT DO YOU DO, VOTE
WITH YOUR FACE?
YOU CAN'T DO IT.
>> I DID IT TODAY.
>> OH, REALLY?
>> I VOTE WITH MY TONGUE.
>> WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE?
>> WE ALSO HAVE THE STATE OF NEW
JERSEY.
WITH 26% REPORTING IS
BEING CALLED FOR BARACK OBAMA!
>> jON: I AM FROM NEW JERSEY.
WE HAVE LOST A LOT OF GREAT
CANDIDATES IN THE BACK OF THAT
OLDS.
THAT GRAPHIC TO ME TELLS THE
STORY.
>> Jon: HOW ABOUT YOUR HOME
STATE, SOUTH CAROLINA?
>> Stephen: MY HOME STATE OF
SOUTH CAROLINA, OH, WELL THIS IS
ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS FOR McCAIN
WITH 34% REPORTING IT HAS
GONE FOR JOHN McCAIN!
NOW THIS IS A ESPECIALLY GOOD
BECAUSE THIS YEAR SOUTH CAROLINA
IS THE BONUS STATE.
IT TRIPLES YOUR ELECTORAL
COUNT.
THIS IS FAR FROM OVER, JON.
>> Jon: YES.
IT IS FAR FROM OVER.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
