BUT TODAY IS A DAY FOR HER TOCELEBRATE.
>> ABC NEWS CAN CONFIRM THATNANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN REELECTED
MINORITY LEADER.
>> Jon: HUZZAH! AND WHAT AMINORITY THE DEMOCRATS ARE.
I THINK AT THIS POINT THEREMIGHT ONLY BE THREE OF THEM
LEFT. IN FACT, AFTER THEDRUBBING THE DEMOCRATS TOOK
IN THE MIDTERM, A LOT OF PEOPLEWERE ASKING IF
NANCY PELOSI WOULD STEP DOWN.
>> AREN'T YOU GETTING A LITTLEOLD, MITCH? SHOULDN'T YOU STEP
ASIDE, YOU HAVE ASKED HIM THATQUESTION?

HE'S ONLY 72 YEARS OLD.
THAT'S BARELY A THIRD OF HISNATURAL LIFESPAN. I DON'T KNOW
WHY -- WHY WOULD YOU --HE'S BUT A TEENAGER.
I'M GONNA LIVE TO BE 208.
[LAUGHING]AND BY THE WAY WHAT IS YOUR
BEEF WITH MCCONNELL.
>> I WAS NEVER ON THE COVER OFTIME MAGAZINE EVEN THOUGH I WAS
THE FIRST WOMAN -- ISN'TTHAT A CURIOSITY THAT
THE REPUBLICANS WIN BOEHNER'S ONTHE FRONT OF TIME MAGAZINE.
MITCH MCCONNEL WINS, HE'S ON THEFRONT OF TIME MAGAZINE.
ISN'T THERE A PATTERN HERE?
AS A WOMAN IT'S LIKE, IS THERE AMESSAGE HERE?
>> Jon: NO, I HEAR YOU.
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THESAME REVERED COMPANY AS HITLER
AND DARKENED OJ.
BUT SO WHAT, YOU DIDN'T GET THETIME MAGAZINE COVER. BUT YOU DID
GET AN AWARD FROM THENATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR WOMEN
AND FAMILIES FOR YOUR LEADERSHIPIN FIGHTING FOR WORKING WOMEN.
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, NANCYPELOSI.
I DON'T THINK HITLER OR OJ EVERGOT HONORED BY THOSE PEOPLE.
YOU'RE A RECOGNIZED CHAMPION OFWORKING WOMEN AND VOTING RIGHTS.
>> RIGHT TO VOTE MUST REMAIN THECORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICASUCCEEDS.
EARLY VOTING IS OUR FRIEND.
RESPECT TO THE NEEDS OF WOMENAND FAMILIES.

ILLINOIS REPRESENTATIVE TAMMYDUCKWORTH DISABLED IRAQ WAR
