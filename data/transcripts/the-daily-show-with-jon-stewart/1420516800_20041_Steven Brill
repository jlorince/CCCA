WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM,STEVEN BRILL.
SIR! NICE TO SEE YOU. WELCOME.
(APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.>> GLAD TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED"AMERICA'S BITTER PILL."
SO LAST TIME YOU WERE HEREYOU HAD WRITTEN THIS SORT OF
INCREDIBLE ARTICLE FOR"TIME" MAGAZINE, WHICH WAS
AN OLD -- BACK IN THE OLDDAYS WAS MAGAZINE PEOPLE WOULD
BUY IN THE NEWSSTANDS.>> RIGHT. WEEKLY. WEEKLY --
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
BUT IT DETAILED AN AWFUL LOTOF THE INHERENT COST
FLUCTIATIONS IN OUR SYSTEMTHAT WERE NOT BEING
ADDRESSED.
IS THIS THE -- THE FLESHEDOUT VERSION OF THAT?
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S MUCH MORETHAN THAT.
>> Jon: YES, SIR.
>> IT USES THE SAGA OF THEFIGHT OVER THE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT, OBAMACARE, TO TELLTHE STORY OF DYSFUNCTIONAL
GOVERNMENT TRYING TO FIX ADYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH-CARE
SYSTEM.
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHATHAPPENS.
>> Jon: BLIND LEADING THEBLIND.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WHAT IS SO INTERESTINGTO ME.
SO YOU COME ON, YOU WRITETHIS REALLY REVEALING EXPOSE
ABOUT THE MEDICAL SYSTEM,COME ON THE PROGRAM.
HOW MUCH LATER, A LITTLE BITLATER, YOU FIND YOURSELF IN
THE HOSPITAL.
>> RIGHT. AS I WAS FINISHING THEREPORTING FOR THE BOOK,
LITERALLY ON THE LAST DAY OF
ENROLLMENT ON THE EXCHANGESFOR OBAMACARE WHICH WAS WHAT A
LOT OF MY REPORTING WAS ABOUT, IWAS TOLD BY A DOCTOR DURING
ROUTINE CHECKUP THAT I NEEDED ANEMERGENCY OPEN HEART SURGERY.
SO OBVIOUSLY I FIGURED THIS GUYWAS TRYING TO EXPLOIT
THE CHARGE AND EVERYTHING I WASDOING.
THIS WAS JUST HIS REVENGE. BUTIT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE.
I HAD THIS THING CALLED ANANEURYSM, YOU HAVE NO SYMPTOMS.
I FELT FINE.
I WORKED OUT THE DAY I HAD THECHECKUP.
>> Jon: IN YOUR HEART. ANANEURYSM IN YOUR HEART.
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE A BUBBLERIGHT ON YOUR HEART,
ON YOUR CHEST.
AND IF IT BURSTS, YOU DON'TGO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM,
YOU'RE JUST DEAD.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINKPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TRYING
TO KILL YOU?
>> I THOUGHT -- I THOUGHT A LOTABOUT THAT.
AND I THINK HE WAS JUST UPSETWITH, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN WITH THE BOOK,BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO WRITE
ABOUT -- HOW THE WEB SITEDIDN'T LAUNCH AND WHY IT
DIDN'T LAUNCH.
HOW HE WAS TOLD IT WASN'T GOINGTO LAUNCH WELL BUT HE WENT
AHEAD ANYWAY.
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY MOSTOF IT.
>> Jon: SO THE NSA AT NIGHTMINIATURIZED, CRAWLED THROUGH
YOUR NASAL SYSTEM, BLEW A BUBBLEIN YOUR HEART.
>> I HOPE IT WAS MY NASALSYSTEM.
>> Jon: EXACTLY THERE ARETOO MANY WAYS TO GET IN
THERE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. SO HAS --SETTLE DOWN.
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU GOT THAT.
>> Jon: FANTASTIC VOYAGE.FANTASTIC VOYAGE.
HAS THE AFFORDABLE CAREACT DONE -- SO SOME OF THE
PROBLEMS THAT WERE IN THERE ISWE AS A NATION COULD NOT
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FORDRUG PRICES.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> SO OUR DRUG PRICES WEREUNREASONABLY HIGH AS
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THEWORLD.
OUR STANDING ON HEALTH CARE WASENORMOUS COMPARED TO THE REST
OF THE WORLD AND YET THE HEALTHRESULTS WERE NOT THE SAME.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: HAVE WE ADDRESSED ANY OFTHESE?
>> WELL, THE WHOLE REFORMWAS SUPPOSED TO DO TWO
THINGS.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GET MOREPEOPLE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE
ONE OF THE SCANDALS IS THAT WEARE THE ONLY DEVELOPED
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERETENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
CAN'T GET HEALTH CARE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. IT SEEMSTO HAVE DONE THAT.
>> AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVECUT COST.
>> Jon: YES.
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS IT GOT MOREPEOPLE HEALTH CARE.
>> Jon: YES.
>> THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THETAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR
THAT HEALTH CARE BY PAYINGTHE SAME EXORBITANT PRICES
AND ALLOWING THE DRUGCOMPANIES AND THE SO-CALLED
NONPROFIT HOSPITALS -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND MEDICAL-DEVICE MAKERS TOMAKE THE SAME EXORBITANT
PROFITS THAT ARE UNSEEN ANYWHEREELSE IN THE WORLD.
SO WE'RE ALL ON THE LINE FORTHAT.
>> Jon: IT HAS NOTCONTROLLED THE PRICES.
BUT YET -->> IT JUST CREATED A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW CUSTOMERS FORTHIS RIDICULOUS
NONFUNCTIONAL MARKETPLACE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT DOESN'T THEFACT THAT IT CREATES ALL
THESE NEW CUSTOMERS DRIVE DOWNTHE PRICES OF THE HEALTH PLANS.
>> NO, WHY WOULD IT?
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DRIVENDOWN.
THEY HAVE NO MARKETCONTROLS.
IT IS NOT A FREE MARKET.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO ONE INTHIS AUDIENCE, YOU OR I, WHO
CAN BE ANY KIND OF A SAVVYCUSTOMER WHEN WE'RE GETTING
HEALTH CARE.
>> Jon: BUT YET HASN'THEALTH CARE SPENDING GONE
DOWN IN 2014? DIDN'T -- IN THE--
>> NO. THE RATE OFINCREASE HAS SLOWED --
>> Jon: SLOWED -->> SLIGHTLY.
>> Jon: THAT'S SOMETHING.
>> THAT'S SOMETHING.
(LAUGHTER) BUT IF YOU READ --
>> Jon: THE RATE OF INCREASE.
>> THE 965 PAGES OF THEAFFORDABLE CARE ACT --
>> Jon: I'M ABOUT THREE QUARTERSOF THE WAY THROUGH.
>> I'M THE ONLY NERD -- YEAH,WELL, I'M ACTUALLY AHEAD OF YOU.
I'M A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF YOU.
THERE IS ISN'T ANYTHINGIN THAT BILL THAT DOES
ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE HIGHCOST OF DRUGS, THE PROFITS
MADE BY NONPROFIT HOSPITALS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WELL, THOSE WERETHE DEALS THEY MADE TO GET IT
PASSED.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT HAVEN'T THEY, WHATI'VE READ IS THAT THE HIGHER
DEDUCTIBLES FOR THESE POLICIES-->> RIGHT.
>> Jon: THE FACT THATPEOPLE NOW WILL HAVE TO GO
MORE OUT OF POCKET FOR THEHIGHER DEDUCTIBLES HAS
CAUSED PEOPLE TO THINK TWICEABOUT THE TYPES OF CARE THAT
WERE MORE ROUTINE, THAT THEYHAVE SLOWED THEIR SPENDING
IN THAT REGARD.
>> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.
THAT IS A NICE THOUGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, THE SECOND PARTOF THAT NICE THOUGHT IS IT MAY
CAUSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THEMEANS, NOT TO GET THE HEALTH
CARE THEY NEED.
BUT THE, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEMWITH HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED
STATES IS VERY SIMPLE.>> Jon: YES.
>> THE PRICES ARE TOO DAMNHIGH.
IT'S LIKE THAT GUY WHO RAN FORMAYOR OR SOMETHING WHO SAID THE
RENT IS TOO HIGH.>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> THE PRICES ARE ALL TOOHIGH.
AND-- .
>> Jon: YOU JUST WROTE THATGUY'S NEXT MAYORAL
CAMPAIGN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. I HOPE.
THIS LAW DOES NOTHING TODEAL WITH THAT.
BUT IT DOES DO A VERY GOODTHING WHICH IS IT GIVES
PEOPLE FROM THETREASURY THE MONEY --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO GO BUY HEALTH CAREAT THOSE SAME RIDICULOUS
PRICES.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND DOES IT NOT ALLEVIATETHE SPENDING ON EMERGENCY
ROOM CARE THOUGH WHERE PEOPLEWITHOUT INSURANCE WOULD JUST
FLOOD WHEN THEY WERE UNABLETO GET INSURANCE?
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENS NOW ISBECAUSE THEY HAVE INSURANCE,
THE HOSPITALS CAN COLLECTMORE MONEY FROM THEM BECAUSE
THEY CAN COLLECT IT FROM THEINSURANCE COMPANY.
>> Jon: SO THEY ARE DOINGBETTER.
>> ALL THE HOSPITALS AREMAKING MUCH MORE MONEY
BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
>> Jon: SON OF A BITCH! ALRIGHT,WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELLUS.
YOU HAVE A NICE FIX FORTHIS.
>> GREAT.
>> WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT ALITTLE BIT WHEN WE COME BACK.
WE'LL COME BACK.
