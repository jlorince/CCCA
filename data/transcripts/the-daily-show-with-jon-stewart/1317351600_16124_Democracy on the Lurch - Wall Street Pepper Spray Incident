ALL RIGHT.
OF COURSE, IT'S OVERSEAS.
DEMOCRACY OVERSEAS CAN BE A
LITTLE MESSY.
IT'S NEW.
HERE, AMERICA, THE CRADLE OF
LIBERTY, WE'RE LONG PAST THOSE
FITS AND STARTS.
WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) WAS THAT ALL
ABOUT?
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID THOSE LADIES TRY AND DRIVE?
WHAT?
THAT'S HERE IN AMERICA?
APPARENTLY, THAT FOOTAGE CAME
FROM THE MARCH ON WALL STREET
THIS PAST SATURDAY DURING AN
ONGOING DEMONSTRATION CALLED,
ODDLY ENOUGH, OCCUPY WALL
STREET.
>> THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS
LIKE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOK LOOK
LIKEES, ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR,
IT'S WHAT BONARU LOOKS LIKE.
WAIT A MINUTE, YOUNG, IDEALISTIC
PROTESTERS, RHYTHMIC DRUMMING,
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF MEDIA
ATTENTION.
WHY, THAT'S THE MATING CALL OF
THE GREEN-CAPPED MICHIGANIAN
WARBLER.
YES, LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME.
DIRECTOR CHAIR MICHAEL MOORE LET
LAWRENCE O'DONNELL KNOW THIS
PROTEST WASN'T ABOUT HIM.
>> THERE'S NO ONE PERSON THAT
COMES IN HERE AND SAYS, "NOW,
THIS IS OUR AGENDA AND THIS IS
THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE."
THERE ARE-- THERE ARE A VARIETY
OF DEMANDS, AND-- AND CONCERNS
WITHIN THIS GROUP.
>> Jon:  SOME WANT TO REFORM
THE SYSTEM OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE.
SOME HAVE AN ISSUE WITH OUR
POLICY TOWARDS ISRAEL.
ONE GIRL OVER THERE IS DRESSED
LIKE A ( BLEEP ) COIN.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT'S
CAN ABOUT.
I GUESS SHE'S TAKING ON SOME
TYPE OF PRO OR ANTI-CHANGE
POSITION.
STILL, AGREE OR DISAGREE, OR NOT
KNOW THE PROTESTERS' GOALS OR
MESSAGE.
ONE THING ALL PEOPLE CAN AGREE
ON IS AT LEAST ONE REACTION TO
THE MOVEMENT WAS UNACCEPTABLE.
>> VIDEO HAS SURFACED OF A
POLICE OFFICER USING PEPPER
SPRAY ON WOMEN DURING THAT
STANDOFF SATURDAY.
>> THERE WERE FIVE YOUNG WOMEN
ON A SIDEWALK STANDING THERE WHO
WERE CONTAINED IN A PEN, AN
ORANGE PLASTIC PEN, JUST
OBSERVING THE PROTEST ON THE
SIDEWALK.
>> THE POLICE COMMANDER USING
PEPPER SPRAY AGAINST SOME YOUNG
WOMEN.
>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT, THAT
LOOKS BAD.
BUT MAYBE THAT COP HAD A GOOD
REASON TO USE A BLINDING,
STINGING CHEMICAL ON FIVE
APPARENTLY ALREADY PENNED IN
WOMEN AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE HIS
FELLOW OFFICERS WHO WERE
SURROUNDING THEM.
MAYBE THE PEPPER SPRAY WAS A
MISTAKE.
IT WAS A HOT DAY.
MAYBE THAT OFFICER WAS REACHING
FOR HIS CANISTER OF COOLING
CUCUMBER MIST SPRAY
( LAUGHTER )
AND GRABBED THE PEPPER SPRAY BY
ACCIDENT.
I'M SURE IF WE JUST FILMED HIM
LATER--
>> Jon:  ( BLEEP )!
HE SPRAYED THE CAM RONOW!
I'M STARTING TO THINK THIS GUY
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE CUCUMBER MIST
SPRAY
( LAUGHTER )
SO WHO EXACTLY WAS THIS HUMAN
CROPDUSTER RAINING HABANERO
MISERY ON THE CROWD?
>> WE NOW KNOW HIS NAME AND
RANK.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAS
CONFIRMED THAT THE
OUT-OF-CONTROL OFFICER IS THE
HIGH-RANKING DEPUTY INSPECTOR
ANTHONY BALOANIA.
( LAUGHTER )
COME ON
( APPLAUSE ).
COME ON.
ANTHONY BALOGNA.
( LAUGHTER )
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT GUY'S
NAME IS TONY BALONEY
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
YOU AND I KNOW.
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY.
TONY BALONEY.
THE GUY'S NAME IS TONY BALONEY.
FAVORITE PASTA, RIGATONI.
FAVORITE ISLAND, CONEY.
FIREFIGHTER ITALIAN PRIME
MINISTER, BERLUSCONI.
FAVORITE RESTAURANT, SHONEY'S.
FAVORITE DESSERT, FRESHED MIXED
BERRIES.
YOU THOUGHT I'D SAY SPUMONI OR
TORTONI.
NO, HE'S LACTOSE INTOLARONI.
THIS GIVES ME AN IDEA.
THIS TONY BALONEY IS A
TELEVISION SERIES WAITING TO
HAPPEN
( LAUGHTER )
AND I'M ABOUT TO HAPPEN IT.
>> IN A CITY GONE MAD, TONY
BALONEY WAS THE FINE MIST OF THE
LAW.
BUT THEN HE WENT TOO FAR.
>> YOU PEPPER SPRAYED FIVE
LADIES IN THE FACE?
>> I GOT RESULTS.
>> YOU'RE A LOOSE NOZZLE,
BALONEY.
TURN IN YOUR BADGE.
AND YOUR SPRAY CAN.
ALL OF IT.
>> LUCKY FOR NEW YORK, BILINI
DOESN'T NEED A BADGE.
>> IT'S BALONEY, CHIEF.
HE'S GONE ROGUE.
>> THAT'S BAD NEWS, NO MATTER
HOW YOU SPLICE IT.
>> AAHH!
>> MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> THIS FALL, JUSTICE HAS A
FIRST NAME.
IT'S SPELLED T-O-N-Y.
AND IT'S GONNA BURN.
CHRIS BALONEY IS TONY BALONEY IN
"THE VIGALONI."
