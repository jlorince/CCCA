ESTIMATED 8 TRILLION
JOURNALISTS HAVE DESCENDED
ON LONDON TO COVER ACCOUNT
ROYAL WEDDING FORCING EVEN
LOVELY LADIES TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.
WE SENT OUR OWN JOHN OLVER
BACK TO ENGLAND TO REPORT ON
THIS VERY SPECIAL DAY.
>> TOMORROW WE WILL ALL
WITNESS THE MOST MAGICAL DAY
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
THE MARRIAGE OF PRINCE
WILLIAM TO KATE MIDDLETON IN
LONDON ENGLAND.
MY HOME TOWN.
NOTHING WAS GOING TO KEEP ME
AWAY.
HELLO, LONDON.
GUESS WHO'S BACK?
JUST HOURS FROM NOW ALL EYES
WILL BE ON BRITAIN.
AND NO ONE IS MORE EXCITED
FOR THIS SPECTACULAR EVENT
THAN THE BRITISH PEOPLE
THEMSELVES.
>> WHY DO WE NEED THE ROYAL
WEDDING?
>> I THINK IT MAKES A
MOCKERY OF OUR COUNTRY, I
THINK IT IS A CHARADE.
I THINK IN THE CURRENT
ECONOMIC CLIMATE I FIND IT
SLIGHTLY DISTASTEFUL THAT WE
ARE PAYING AS THE PUBLIC FOR
PART OF THE WEDDING.
I THINK IT IS UTTER [BLEEP]
BOLLOCKS.
IT SHOULDN'T COST US A
PENNY.
I DON'T NEED TO SEE THIS
[BLEEP], [BLEEP].
>> HAVING SAID THAT IT IS A
MAGICAL DAY AND WE ARE ALL
LOOKING FOR TO, RIGHT, MIKE?
>> NO.
>> BUT REAL QUALITY ENGLISH
PEOPLE LIKE FRIEND OF THE
ROYAL FAMILY ARE HAVING NONE
OF THAT UTTER [BLEEP]
BOLLOCKS.
>> I THINK THE BRITISH
TAXPAYER IS BEING VERY MEAN
ABOUT PAYING FOR THIS
WEDDING.
I MEAN IT IS A PRIVILEGE.
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY EXCITED.
JUST LOOK AT ALL OF THESE
IDIOTS?
>> YES, THEY ARE EXCITED
BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEING
SOMETHING WHICH IS GLAMOROUS,.
>> RIGHT.
>> I PREFER TO BE PAYING FOR
THE ROYAL WEDDING AND CLEAN
THE STREETS AFTERWARDS AND
ALL THE SECURITY THAN TO BE
PAYING FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS TO CLAIM BENEFITS
AND LIVE THIS --
>> WHY NOT MAKE IT A RACE
ISSUE.
>> YES.
>> WHY NOT?
>> WHY NOT.
>> AND I FOUND THIS AVERAGE
JOE SIX PINT WHO WAS ALSO
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
FESTIVITIES.
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
A GREAT DAY.
I AM HAVING TEA, CELEBRATING
WITH SOME FRIENDS, IN FACT.
>> UH-HUH.
>> ROBERT, ARE YOU [BLEEP]
KIDDING ME?
>> YOU ARE THE MOST ENGLISH
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
>> RIGHT.
>> IT'S INTERESTING WAY OF
PUTTING IT BUT I'M A VERY
TRADITIONAL PERSON AND YOU
KNOW, WHEN I GO TO WORK IN
CENTRAL LONDON, I DRESS AS I
THINK IS APPROPRIATE TO WORK
IN CENTRAL LONDON.
>> IN THE 17th CENTURY.
WELL, THE WEDDING IS
ESTIMATED TO COST TAXPAYERS
ROUGHLY $20 MILLION POUNDS.
SURELY EVEN GRAHAM SMITH OF
THE REFORM GROUP REPUBLIC
COULD SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF
THIS OCCASION.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
OBSESSING OVER STUFF THAT
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
WE ARE FACING HUGE AUSTERITY
MEASURES,
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR POUND
CUTS TO SERVICES FOR A MAJOR
CIVIL WAR IN LIBYA, AND
REVOLUTIONS RIGHT ACROSS
ACCOUNT MIDDLE EAST.
MASSIVE EARTHQUAKES IN
JAPAN.
AND YET THE WEDDING, QUITE
OFTEN IS LEADING THE NEWS.
>> RIGHT, YEAH, IT'S
TERRIBLE, ISN'T IT?
>> HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
KATE'S STYLE.
WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS
EFFORTLESS?
>> I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT AT
ALL.
>> LUCKILY, CRITICS LIKE
SMITH MAKE UP JUST AN 80%
MINORITY OF BRITISH OPINION.
WHAT THEY FAIL TO GRASP IS
THAT THE MONARCHY IS NEVER
MORE RELEVANT THAN IN TIMES
OF GREAT CRISIS.
THE ROYAL FAMILY HAVE ALWAYS
STEPPED UP TO DISTRACT US
WHEN THE WORLD HAS BECOME
TOO HORRIBLE.
LOOK AT 1981.
AIDS WAS DISCOVERED.
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED THAT YEAR?
>> CHARLES MARRIED DIANA.
>> EXACTLY.
>> 1986, CHERN NOBLE, A
DISASTER ON AN UNPRECEDENTED
SCALE, THE AFTERAFFECTS OF
WHICH WE ARE STILL FEELING
TODAY.
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN '86.
>> WELL N '86 PRINCE ANDREW
MARRIED SARAH FERGUSON.
>> THANK YOU.
>> SHE IS A DISASTER
POSSIBLY ON THE SAME LEVEL
OF CHERNOBYL.
>> THE WEDDING PROCESSION
WILL TRAVEL FROM WESTMINSTER
ABBEY TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE
RIGHT PAST ANTI-WAR
ACTIVISTS WHO HAVE BEEN
CAMPED OUT THERE FOR YEARS.
>> I AM DISTURBED BECAUSE
THIS USED TO BE PUBLIC SPACE
IT IS A NICE PLACE TO GATHER
AND PRACTICE FREE SPEECH AND
THE POLICE HAVE MOVED US TO
THE CURB NOW AND THAT'S
PRETTY DISTRESSFUL.
>> IS THAT NOT WHY WE NEED
THIS WEDDING, TO HELP THE
WORLD FORGET PEOPLE LIKE
YOU?
>> WE'RE TO THE GOING
ANYWHERE UNTIL THIS WAR IS
OVER.
>> WHAT HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
IS THAT THE ROYAL WEDDING IS
SO MAGICAL IT'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THAT
PROBLEM AS WELL.
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE A
A-- EVERY FIVE SEATS BETWEEN
WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND
BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
PEOPLE ARE ARE BEING BROUGHT
BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN TO
SERVE THIS WEDDING.
>> BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.
>> BECAUSE THIS IS
IMPORTANT.
>> THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
OCCASION.
THE QUEEN WILL BE ON THE
BALCONY WITH HER GRANDSON
AND HER NEW GRANDDAUGHTER IN
LAW.
>> AND WILL THE QUEEN BE
THANKING THE TAXPAYER FROM
UP THERE?
>> I THINK JUST SEEING HER
IS ENOUGH TO PAY GOOD MONEY
FOR.
I THINK THE TAXPAYER GETS
THEIR MONEY WITH FROM THE
QUEEN WHEN SHE APPEARS ON
THE BALCONY.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> IN JUST HOURS, THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE WILL BE LINING
THESE STREETS ENJOYING THE
MOST SPECTACULAR WEDDING THE
WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.
AND THE NEXT DAY, THOSE SAME
PEOPLE WILL WAKE UP BLEERY
EYED SAYING OH [BLEEP], HOW
MUCH DID THAT JUST
