( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
.
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
VERY EXCITED TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERY
EXCITED, KING ABDULLAH OF JORDAN
IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE
PROGRAM TONIGHT, VERY EXCITED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT FIRST-- BUT FIRST I HAVE A
QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
A FELLOW IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT
BEFORE THE SHOW, A FELLOW IN THE
AUDIENCE ASKED A NICE LADY TO
MARRY HIM.
HERE'S THE CRAZY PART: MET HER
IN LINE.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NO.
EIGHT YEARS.
THEY'VE BEEN GOING OUT FOR EIGHT
YEARS.
IT WAS--
(APPLAUSE).
IT WAS A VERY MOVING AND HEART
FELT MOMENT.
I THOUGHT PUNCTUATED BY THE
PHRASE-- WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE
A HALLMARK CARD--
(LAUGHTER)
"(BLEEP) YEAH I'LL MARRY YOU."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BEAUTIFUL.
GOT YOU RIGHT HERE.
GOT YOU RIGHT HERE.
VERY EXCITING.
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE CANADIAN
SO THEIR BABIES, I'M SURE, WILL
BE GAY SOCIALISTS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHATEVER IT IS CANADIANS MAKE UP
THERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, KING ABDULLAH, OF
COURSE, HE IS IN NEW YORK CITY
FOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY,
OR, AS WE LIKE TO THINK OF IT,
THE REASON I CAN'T GET TO WORK
BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC!
(LAUGHTER)
THE EVENT HAS S A GATHERING IN
THE INTERNATIONAL JUGGALOS.
WITH LIBYA IN TURMOIL, SYRIA IN
FLAMES, IRAN ON THE VERGE OF A
NUCLEAR WEAPON, AN INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR PRESIDENT
NOT JUST TO ADDRESS THE WORLD
COMMUNITY BUT FOR SOME
HIGH-LEVEL PRES-ON-PRES ACTION.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS HE HAS
NO PLANS TO HAVE ANY PRIVATE
LEADINGS WITH WORLD LEADERS.
>> Jon: OH.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S-- PROBABLY
PROTOCOL.
IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR ONE-ON-ONE
MEETINGS WITH OTHER WORLD
LEADERS!
>> OUR RESEARCH SHOWS IT'S BEEN
20 YEARS SINCE A PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN TO THAT MEETING AND NOT MET
ONE ON ONE WITH A FOREIGN
LEADER.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: OH.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, I GUESS IF THE WORLD
LEADERS WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH
HIM PERSONALLY THEY CAN JUST
DONATE $5 TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND
TAKE THEIR CHANCES LIKE THE REST
OF US.
(LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY.
I'M SURE THERE'S A GOOD REASON
WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOT GOING
TO BE FACE TO FACE WITH WORLD
LEADERS IN THESE DIFFICULT AND
HISTORIC TIMES.
>> THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY HAS A
BUSY SCHEDULE.
HE HAS A BUSY SCHEDULE ALL TIME.
>> Jon: YEAH, HE'S GOT A BUSY
SCHEDULE!
(LAUGHTER)
HE CAN'T JUST BE MEETING EVERY
WORLD LEADER WILLY-NILLY!
(LAUGHTER)
JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT MEETING
THEM FACE TO FACE DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S NOT FILLED WITH HIGH LEVEL
STRATEGIC ROOM DEFCON ECONOMIC
SIMULATIONS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL APPEAR
ON "THE VIEW" THIS
