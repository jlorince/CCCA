[THEME SONG PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JIEWRTDMENT WE EACH
GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
I'M TELLING YOU, IT IS A SHOW
THE POPE WOULD TWEET ABOUT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS LOUIS CK.
VERY FEW OF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT
THE CK IS SHORT FOR [BLEEPED]
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH, MAN.
ALL DAY WE'RE HERE WRITING, ALL
DAY.
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH NEWS
OUT OF ILLINOIS.
YOU MAY REMEMBER ABOUT A YEAR
AGO FORMER GOVERNOR ROD BLAH...
[STUMBLES OVER NAME] TOURED THE
COUNTRY PROMISING HE'D BE
VINDICATED OF ALL CHARGES.
HE VISITED THE "DAILY SHOW"
WHERE I MADE A PROMISE TO HIM.
AGAIN, IF YOU GET OFF SCOT-FREE,
THERE'S A HUG WAITING FOR YOU.
>> I'M DETERMINED TO WORK EVEN
HARDER TO GET THAT.
>> Jon: WELL, TONIGHT I HAVE
SOME VERY GOOD NEWS TO REPORT.
I WILL NOT HAVE TO HUG ROD
BLAGOJEVICH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND HERE'S WHY:
>> IN CHICAGO TODAY, THE JURY
SAID GUILTY 17 TIMES AS THE
FORMER ILLINOIS GOVERNOR ROD
BLAGOJEVICH WAS CONVICTED OF
ATTEMPTED DISTORTION, BRIBERY,
CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD.
>> Jon: 17 FELONY CONVICTIONS,
OR AS THAT'S KNOWN, A CHICAGO
DOZEN.
[LAUGHTER]
ON HIS WAY TO THE KRAUS TO HEAR
THE VERDICT, BLAH...
[STUMBLES OVER NAME] WAS
UNUSUALLY CIRCUMSPECT
>> MY HANDS ARE SHAKY, MY NEEMS
ARE WEEK, I CAN'T SEEM TO STAND
ON MY OWN TWO FEET.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: QUOTING ELVIS ON YOUR
WAY TO HEAR A CRIMINAL VERDICT
AND YOU GO WITH "ALL SHOOK UP"?
"JAILHOUSE ROCK" DOESN'T COME UP
IN THAT?
"SUSPICIOUS MINDS"?
♪♪
I'M CAUGHT IN A TRAP ♪♪
NOTHING.
OF COURSE, THAT WAS ON HIS WAY
TO THE VERDICT BEING READ.
AFTER WORDS, BLAH...
[STUMBLES OVER NAME] WANTED
PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT HE'D LEARNED
HIS LESSON.
>> AMONG THE MANY LESSONS I'VE
LEARNED FROM THIS WHOLE
EXPERIENCE IS TO TRY TO SPEAK A
LITTLE BIT LESS, SO I'M GOING TO
KEEP MY REMARKS KIND OF SHORT.
>> Jon: YOU WEREN'T CONVICTED
OF NOT BEING CONCISE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOUR WORDS ON OBAMA'S SENATE
SEAT, "I'VE GOT THIS THING AND
IT'S [BLEEPED] GOLDEN AND I'M
JUST NOT GIVING IT UP FOR
[BLEEPED] NOTHING."
THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SUCCINCT.
BUT ROD BLAH...
[STUMBLES OVER NAME], HIS
BEFORE-AND-AFTER REANGSTS ARE
BUT SMALL PART OF WHAT'S TRULY
ASTONISHING THING ABOUT THIS
STORY.
THE TRULY ASTONISHING PART OF
THIS STORY IS ROD BLAGOJEVICH IS
THE FOURTH OUT OF THE LAST SEVEN
ELECTEDDED GOVERNORS OF ILLINOIS
TO BE CONVICTED OF A FELONY.
FOUR OUT OF THE LAST SEVEN.
57%.
IF YOU WERE AN INDIVIDUAL IN
ILLINOIS, YOU WOULD HAVE A
BETTER CHANCE OF AVOIDING JAIL
BY FLIPPING A COIN, HEADS BEING
JAIL, TAILS BEING NO JAIL, THAN
BY BEING ELECTED GOVERNOR OF
ILLINOIS.
LET'S SAY YOU'RE THE PRESENT
GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS AND YOU'RE
IN A ROOM WITH A FORMER GOVERNOR
OF ILLINOIS ON YOUR RIGHT AND A
FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS ON
YOUR LEFT.
CHANCES ARE THE ROOM YOU'RE IN
IS JAIL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
