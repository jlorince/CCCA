>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF MYFAVORITES.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIANS INTHE ENTIRE
UNIVERSE, YOUNG JERRY SEINFELDWILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
HE'S VERY TALENTED.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]A TOP DOG.
BUT FIRST, IF YOU'RE LIKE MANYOF OUR VIEWERS, YOU ASK ME IF I
LIKE GETTING BLOWN.
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
[LAUGHTER]WEIRD.
SOMETIMES THE Q&A IN THEBEGINNING GETS A LITTLE OUT OF
HAND IS WHAT I'M SAYING, BUT IFYOU'RE LIKE MANY OF OUR VIEWERS,
YOU'RE PROBABLY WATCHING THISSHOW RIGHT NOW WHILE DRIVING.
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, STOP!
VERY DANGEROUS, NOT BECAUSE ITPULLS YOUR FOCUS FROM THE ROAD
BUT BECAUSE OF THE ROAD ITSELF.
>> THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY TRUSTFUND IS ABOUT TO BECOME
INSOLVENT.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
[LAUGHTER]FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
OUR FEDERAL HIGHWAYS HAVE ATRUST FUND.
GET A JOB.
YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T PULLTHEMSELVES UP FROM GRAVEL JUST
TO HAVE YOU LAY THERE.
WELL, ACTUALLY... NOW, I KNOWOUR FEDERAL HIGHWAYS ARE THE
VITAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF OURNATION'S COMMERCE, BUT WHAT
EXACTLY HAPPENS IF IT LOSES ITSTRUST FUND?
>> THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RUNSDRY NEXT MONTH.
UPKEEP AND REPAIRS NEEDED FOR ANAGING HIGHWAY SYSTEM.
65% OF ROADS ARE INLESS-THAN-GOOD CONDITION.
25% OF BRIDGES NEED SIGNIFICANTREPAIR.
THIS BRIDGE COLLAPSE INWASHINGTON STATE IS A CAUTIONARY
TALE.
>> Jon: HMM.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, WHAT IF INSTEAD OF FUNDING
OUR HIGHWAY SYSTEM, WE JUSTDON'T TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON
STATE?
[LAUGHTER]>> IF WE DON'T PASS THIS
TRANSPORTATION BILL NOW, A LOTOF VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN VERY
SOON.
>> Jon: DID YOU JUST [BLEEPED]THREATEN ME?
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID?
"YOU KNOW WHAT OUR HIGHWAYSYSTEM GIVES ME?
ENTHUSIASMS."
[LAUGHTER]WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS... UH, UH,
UH... THAT'S NICE... I'LL GIVEYOU THAT. THAT'S A NICE ONE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
LOOK, THIS WHOLE CRUMBLINGINFRASTRUCTURE THING, WE HAVE
BEEN DOWN THIS, UM, WHAT DO THEYCALL THOSE, IT'S LIKE A FLAT
THING?
YOU DRIVE ON THEM?
THERE'S ONE THAT HAS YELLOWBRICKS.
WHERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T NEEDTHEM.
ONE OF THEM GOES TO WELLVILLE.
ANYWAY, CONGRESS IS PRESENTEDWITH A PRESSING PROBLEM THAT
REQUIRES SOME MONEY.
WE KNOWS HOW THIS GOES, A YEARAND A HALF AND TWO GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWNS LATER THE PROBLEM ISSTILL THERE AND A COUPLE OF
80-YEAR-OLDS ARE CAUGHT TRYINGTO BREAK INTO THE WORLD WAR II
MEMORIAL.
>> LAWMAKERS IN THE HOUSE VOTEDOVERWHELMINGLY TO EXTEND HIGHWAY
FUNDING WITH NEARLY $11BILLION.
>> THAT KEEPS TRANSPORTATIONFUNDING GOING THROUGH MAY OF
NEXT YEAR.
>> PUTTING OFF THE LARGER ISSUESO IT CAN BE FOUGHT OVER YET
AGAIN.
[BLEEPED][LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO THEY THREW A LITTLEMONEY IT, JUST A LITTLE BIT,
AND THEN JUST KICKED THE CANDOWN THE -- OH, WHAT IS THAT
THING CALLED THAT YOU KICKTHE...
IT'S PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS?
I WENT TO PERDITION ON IT.
NO. THAT'S JUST... BOY...[LAUGHTER]
I HAVE...NO, NO, NO, I HAVELIKE, HONESTLY, WE WROTE
LIKE 100 OF THESE. I CAN'TEVEN...
I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT ICAN'T EVEN PUT YOU THROUGH IT
ANYMORE.
I MEAN TO REMEMBER THIS WORDYOU'D HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF,
OH, WHAT KIND OF SCHOLAR ISTHAT?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I FEEL DIRTY.
[LAUGHTER]SO WHY DID THE HIGHWAY TRUST
FUND RUN OUT OF MONEY ANYWAY?
HOW DO WE NORMALLY FUND THISTHING?
>> THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND GETSREVENUE FROM AN 18.4 CENT PER
GALLON GAS TAX SET BACK IN 1993.
BUT 21 YEARS LATER, THE TAX HASSTAYED FLAT.
>> WHAT? 1993.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, BACK THEN GASWAS $1.70 A GALLON, A CAR WAS
$11,000 AND GETTING BLOWNIN THE BACK OF ONE WAS
CONSIDERED THE HEIGHTOF SOPHISTICATION.
[LAUGHTER]SO WAIT.
THIS IS, THIS IS EASY THEN. TOFUND THE HIGHWAYS, ALL YOU GOT
TO DO IS RAISE THE GAS TAX, ANDTHAT WOULD --
[ALARM SOUNDS] SHUT THAT OFF!
I'M JUST SAYING, IF WE TRACKEDIT WITH INFLATION IT WOULD BE UP
TO 30 CENTS A GALLON NOW, SOJUST BY RAISING THE GAS TAX --
[ALARM SOUNDS]OH, SON OF A BITCH.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, IT IS?
>> I'VE NEVER SUPPORTEDRAISING THE GAS TAX.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GETTO A LONG-TERM HIGHWAY BILL HERE
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS.
>> THIS IS SO STUPID.
WE'VE PAID FOR OUR HIGHWAYS WITHTHE GAS TAX SINCE THE START OF
THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM.
PRESIDENT OBAMA, TELL THEREPUBLICANS TO SUCK IT UP AND
GET THAT GAS TAX BACK UP TOWHERE IT'S MEANT TO BE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN ALSOMAKES NO MENTION OF THE GAS TAX.
>> Jon: SON OF A... AND YOUCALL YOURSELF A TAX-AND-SPEND
LIBERAL.
HOW YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THIS?
>> WE PAY FOR THISTRANSPORTATION PROJECT IN PART
BY CLOSING TAX LOOPHOLES FORCOMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS
OVERSEAS AND AVOID PAYING THEIRFAIR SHARE OF TAXES.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
CERTAINLY TO ONE WOMAN IN THEAUDIENCE.
[LAUGHTER]WHO SEEMINGLY FORGOT THAT SHE
WAS NO LONGER IN HER LIVING ROOMAND THOUGHT, WHY NOT JUST SHOUT
AT THE TV WHILE I'M AT IT.
[LAUGHTER]AMAZINGLY, IF WE WANT TO GET TO
POINT A IN SOLVING TRUST FUNDWITH CRUMBLING BRIDGES TO POINT
B, SOLVENT TRUST FUND WITH FIXEDBRIDGES, WE CAN TAKE A DIRECT
ROUTE, RAISE THE GAS TAX WITHTHE RATE OF INFLATION, OR MAKE A
SLIGHT DETOUR THROUGH OFF-SHORELOOPHOLE BOULEVARD.
THESE ARE TWO REASONABLE ANDEFFICACIOUS WAYS OF FIXING OUR
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.
SO HOW DID WE ACTUALLY RAISE THE$11 BILLION STOPGAP MEASURE, A
MORE ECONOMICAL FIX THAT DOESN'TCOME WITH ALL THE
FEATURES LIKE POWER WINDOWSOR FIXED BRIDGES?
>> TO RAISE THAT MONEY THE PLANWOULD USE AN APPROACH CALLED
PENSION SMOOTHING, WHICH ALLOWSEMPLOYERS TO DELAY CONTRIBUTIONS
TO PENSIONS PLANS.
THAT GENERATES MORE TAX DOLLARSSINCE PENSION PAYMENTS ARE TAX
DEDUCTIBLE.
>> Jon: OH, PENSION SMOOTHING.
I'VE NEVER HEARD [BLEEPED]CALLED "SMOOTHING" BEFORE.
SO INSTEAD OF GOING DIRECTLYFROM POINT A TO POINT B, WHICH
IS HOW WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT,INSTEAD OF GOING DIRECTLY FROM
POINT A TO POINT B OR EVENJUST TAKING A ONE MINOR ROUTE,
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLYDOING, PENSION SMOOTHING.
BASICALLY COMPANIES ARE ALLOWEDTO REDUCE THEIR PENSION
OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES,THUS GIVING THEM A HIGHER PROFIT
MARGIN ON WHICH THEY PAY MORETAX.
FOR THIS YEAR, TO THE TUNE OF$11 BILLION.
OF COURSE, IF THEY'REEVENTUALLY TO MAKE GOOD ON THOSE
PENSION OBLIGATIONS, THEYWILL GET TO CLAIM MUCH
HIGHER TAX BREAKS IN THE FUTURE,AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL
LOSE THAT MONEY.
ONCE AGAIN LIVING UP TO THEMOTTO, OVER THE CAPITOL
BUILDING'S DOOR A LATIN PHRASEMEANING:
[BLEEPED] IT, WE'LL PROBABLY ALLBE DEAD IN TEN YEARS ANYWAY.
ALRIGHT, YOU KNOW, IT'S CRAZYHOW THE WEALTHIEST MOST POWERFUL
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ALWAYSSEEMS TO BE EXPENDING ALL ITS
ENERGY TO GETABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.
IF ONLY THIS HIGHWAY FUNDINGSITUATION PROVIDED MAYBE A
VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW WEOPERATE.
>> IT'S SO EXCITING.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE ROAD IN ALONG TIME.
>> MR. OBAMA SEEMED TO ENJOY HISMOMENT OF VIRTUAL FREEDOM.
THE PRESIDENT DROVE EVEN IF ITWAS ONLY IN A SIMULATOR.
HE BUCKLED UP AND CRUISED DOWN AVIRTUAL HIGHWAY.
>> Jon: YEP.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GETTINGSOMEWHERE, BUT WE AIN'T.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
