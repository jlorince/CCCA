WELL BOOKED, TODAY'S SHOW.
WELL BOOKED.
AGE-OLD STORY.
BOY MEETS GIRL.
BOY MARRIES HER.
BOY GETS PROMOTED.
BOY BANGS UNDERLING.
NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS OR IS THERE IN
>> THIS WAS ANNOUNCED THREE DAYS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
WAS IT HELD?
>> WHEN WAS THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD?
YOU JUST HAVE TO WONDER WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?
>> TO BE TOLD ON TUESDAY AT 5:00 P.M. OF ELECTION DAY WHICH IS THE STORY NOW.
FRANK HE LOO IT DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST.
>> Jon: IT HAS A YUCKY SMELL.
CONSPIRACY NUMBER ONE.
THE F.B.I. HELD BACK THE PETRAEUS AFFAIR STORY TO PREVENT OBAMA FROM LOSING THE ELECTION.
WHY WE TRAY US' AFFAIR WOULD HAVE HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE ELECTION I'M NOT SURE.
THE POINT IS IF ONLY A REPUBLICAN HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS PRIOR TO ELECTION DAY.
>> HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR SAID AN F.B.I. EMPLOYEE TOLD HIM IN OCTOBER ABOUT THE
PETRAEUS AFFAIR.
>> Jon: OH.
THE REAL QUESTION IS, WHY IS ERIC CANTOR PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT?
WHY?
CONSPIRACY ONE DOWN.
WHY WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION WANT TO TAKE OUT PETRAEUS NOW?
>> THIS IS HIGHLY SUS SPUSH US IN ITS TIMING
>> A FEW DAYS BEFORE PETRAEUS IS SET TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT BENGHAZI AND WHAT THE
C.I.A. DID IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
>> SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS
>> THIS IS VERY SUSPICIOUS E FACT THAT HE NO LONGER WILL HAVE TO TESTIFY
>> NOW HE WON'T TESTIFY, FOLKS.
Jon: RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS ABOUT TO TESTIFY ON BENGHAZI, CONSPIRACY NUMBER TWO, NOW WE'LL
NEVER KNOW WHAT PETRAEUS KNEW UNLESS QUITTING IS DIFFERENT FROM DYING.
AND HAS NO BEARING ON WHETHER PETRAEUS WILL HAVE TO TESTIFY.
>> THAT'S A LITTLE BIT NONSENSE BECAUSE HE WILL BE SUMMONED UP TO THE HILL.
HE WILL TESTIFY.
>> Jon: OR WILL HE?
OH, HE WILL.
OF COURSE PETRAEUS HAS ALREADY SPOKEN ONCE TO THE CONGRESS ABOUT BENGHAZI.
WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS WORTH
>> WHAT DID DAVID PETRAEUS DO RIGHT AFTER WE STARTED FINDING OUT ABOUT BENGHAZI.
HE SEEMED TO SIDE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT IT WAS THE VIDEOTAPE.
WHY DID DAVID PETRAEUS SIDE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE IN THAT TESTIMONY?
HE KNEW HE WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS PERSONAL LIFE.
BUT IS THERE MORE TO THIS STORY ABOUT WHY HE SAID THAT?
>> Jon: CONSPIRACY NUMBER 3.
EITHER THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BLACKMAILED THE HEAD OF THE C.I.A., FORCING HIM
TO AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S LIE, OR THAT THEORY IS STUPID.
CAN'T BE BOTH.
STILL THOUGH...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ... WHILE WE DON'T HAVE FACTS, WHILE WE DON'T HAVE FACTS, WE DO
HAVE FEELINGS
>> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE "WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON" KIND OF MOMENTS.
THIS FEELS A LITTLE HOMELAND.
>> Jon: REALLY LIKE THE SHOW HOMELAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT HOMELAND.
IT'S MELROSE PLACE.
HERE'S THE CONSPIRACY.
A POWERFUL MAN HAD AN AFFAIR WITH A PHONY ADMIRER.
ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE SAW ANOTHER GIRL FLIRTING WITH HIM AND SHE WAS LIKE EMAIL WHY ARE YOU
FLIRTING WITH MY MAN?
BECAUSE I SAW HIM FIRST.
THE OTHER GIRL IS IS I'M GOING TO CALL MY FRIEND WHO WORKS AT THE F.B.I. BECAUSE YOU'RE
SCARING THE [BLEEP] OUT OF ME.
MY GOD, THIS GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.
WELL NOT NECESSARILY THE TOP.
TO THAT AREA BETWEEN THE PELVIS AND THE UPPER THIGHS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
