ACTUALLY, PRIEBUS WAS SOUNDING WHAT WAS THE MAIN MOTIF OF THE EVENING: THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE
(BLEEP)ED LIVES, TOO.
>> MY DAD AND MY UNCLES OWNED A BAR IN CINCINNATI.
I WORKED THERE GROWING UP,
MOPPING FLOORS, WAITING TABLES.
IN COLLEGE I WORKED IN A HOSPITAL CAFETERIA.
>> MY PARENTS IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY WITH $10 IN THEIR POCKETS.
>> DAD GREW UP IN POVERTY.
>> FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS I BUILT A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
>> I BUILT BUSINESSES AND CREATED HUNDREDS OF JOBS.
>> Jon: I WAS BORN INSIDE A BLOATED DEAD RABBIT CARCASS!
(LAUGHTER) AND I WAS RAISED BY MAGGOTS!
(LAUGHTER) TODAY I OWN THREE WENDY'S FRANCHISES.
(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE...
(LAUGHTER).
AT HOME I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO SPEAK MAGGOT.
IT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THE NIGHT'S THEME: SELF-RELIANCE ENCAPSULATED BY A NEW REPUBLICAN
CALL TO ARMS.
SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH IT.
>> HE THINKS THAT IF YOU STARTED A BUSINESS "YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT."
YOU DID BUILD THAT!
>> WE BUILT IT!
>> THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T BUILD IT, THEY BUILT IT!
>> THEY REALLY DID BUILD IT!
>> WE BUILT IT!
WE BUILT IT!
>> MITT ROMNEY WAS NOT HANDED SUCCESS.
HE BUILT IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: EMPHASIS WAS A LITTLE OFF THERE.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HEARD A CATCH PHRASE THAT WAS SUCH A PECULIAR MIX OF BRAGGADOCIO AND
WHINEY PETULANCE.
>> WOW, WINNING!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: YEAH, I THINK THAT WAS IT.
WE BUILT THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN RETORT TO BARACK OBAMA'S COLLECTIVISM.
AND IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST POLITICAL MANTRAS I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME THAT SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THE WORD "DUH" BEFOREHAND.
DUH, WE BUILT IT!
(LAUGHTER) ONLY ONE PROBLEM: THIS DEFINING THEME OF THE CAMPAIGN IS BASED ON A STATEMENT THAT THE
PRESIDENT MADE.
>> YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
>> Jon: BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO...
>> SOMEBODY HELPED TO CREATE THIS UNBELIEVABLE AMERICAN SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THAT ALLOWS
YOU TO THRIVE.
SOMEBODY INVESTED IN ROADS AND BRIDGES.
IF YOU GOT A BUSINESS, THAT...
YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
>> Jon: SEE, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ROADS, BRIDGES, CONVENTION CENTERS, THE INFRASTRUCTURE,
THAT GOVERNMENT HAS A HAND IN BUILDING THAT HELPS CREATE THE STABLE CONDITIONS THAT AID ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BRING SOME NUANCE AND NOT OVERPLAY YOUR HAND ON THIS
"WE BUILT IT...".
>> PERFORMING "I BUILT IT," LANE TURNER!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
HOW DO YOU BUILD A SONG...
(BLEEP) JUST PLAY IT.
♪ I BUILT IT WITH NO HELP FROM UNCLE SAM... ♪ (AUDIENCE REACTS).
>> Jon: WOW.
I OWE YOU WILL I. AM'S "YES, WE CAN" SONG A HUGE APOLOGY.
WOW, T-SHIRTS, SONGS, I IMAGINE SOON "WE BUILT IT" WILL HAVE ITS
OWN BREAKFAST CEREAL... REALLY?
ALREADY?
(LAUGHTER) WE BUILT THAT, THE FREE MARKET CEREAL WHERE EVERY BOX COMES WITH A PRIZE INSIDE.
THE PRIZE IS RAT FECES BECAUSE THE F.D.A. CAN
