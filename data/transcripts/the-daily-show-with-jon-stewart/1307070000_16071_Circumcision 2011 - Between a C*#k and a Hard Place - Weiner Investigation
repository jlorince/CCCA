(LAUGHTER)
A GUY CAN'T WIN.
LOOK, I KNOW CONGRESSMAN
WEINER.
AS OF TUESDAY, HE, I'M SURE,
WOULD PREFER THIS ALL GO
AWAY.
LET'S WATCH.
>> -- RETURN TO, WITHOUTING
ON THE THINGS I CARE ABOUT.
I HAVE BEEN IN THE STORY A
COUPLE OF DAYS NOW, HAVE
GIVEN COMMENTS ON IT, THIS
IS A DISTRACK AND I'M TO THE
GOING TO LET IT DISTRACT ME.
>> Jon: DISTRACTION?
NO DISRESPECT, A DISTRACTION
IS A CELL PHONE GOING OFF IN
A MEETING.
THIS IS LIKE HAVING AN
INFLATABLE NOODLE MAN AT A
BRIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, YOU
KNOW?
(LAUGHTER)
JUST SAYING.
BY THE WAY, AUNT DORIS,
AGAIN, I CAN'T APOLOGISE
ENOUGH.
SO-- THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE
THE WHOLE AFFAIR FESTIVE.
ANYWAY, THE CONGRESSMAN'S
VOW OF ABSTINENCE FROM
TALKING ABOUT THE SCANDAL--
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, HIS ABSTINENCE TALKING
ABOUT IT LASTED LESS THAN 24
HOURS.
>> NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN
ANTHONY WEINER SITS DOWN
WITH NBC'S LUKE RUSSERT.
>> HERE NOW FOR THE
INTERVIEW CONGRESSMAN
WEINER.
>> I TALKED WITH CONGRESSMAN
LATE THIS AFTERNOON.
>> DID YOU SEND THAT PICTURE
TO THAT COLLEGE STUDENT IN
WASHINGTON STATE.
>> I DID NOT.
>> Jon: BOOM!
DONE!
THANK YOU.
A DIRECT ANSWER.
>> BUT YOU'RE NOT 100% SURE
WHETHER THE PHOTO IS
ACTUALLY YOU.
>> WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IS
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT
QUESTION.
BUT WE'RE DOING AN
INVESTIGATION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OKAY THAT LAST PART
DIDN'T HELP.
AN INVESTIGATION.
YOU KNOW, I'M NO BIG CITY
DETECTIVE BUT WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CHECK INSIDE YOUR
PANTS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHERE I BELIEVE YOU KEEP THE
ITEM IN QUESTION.
SERIOUSLY, AN INVESTIGATION?
YOUR PENIS DIDN'T ROB THE
BELLAGIO.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WOULD MAKE SUCH A GREAT
CLOONEY MOVIE.
(LAUGHTER)
SO YOU ARE SAYING A
COUNTERFEIT PENIS BECAUSE
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN
THAT SITUATION WAS ADD A
WATERMARK.
>> WE WANT TO RESOLVE IT
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
WOULD YOU KNOW IF THIS IS
YOUR UNDERPANTS.
>> THE QUESTION IS SHALL
DID -- I APPRECIATE YOU
CONTINUING TO FLASH THAT AT
ME.

AWKWARD THAN THAT INCIDENT
WAS THE SCENE IN HOUR
