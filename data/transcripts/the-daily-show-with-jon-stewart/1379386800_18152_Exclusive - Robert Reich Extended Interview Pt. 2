ALL RIGHT.
WE ALWAYS-- EVERYBODY ALWAYSSAYS LET'S GETS BIG MONEY
OUT OF POLITICS.
IN WHAT UNIVERSE HAS BIGMONEY EVER BEEN OUT OF
POLITICS FROM THE HISTORY OFMAN, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
THE MOST CONTROL THE LEVERSOF POWER.
THAT SEEMS LIKE A UTOPIANIDEAL THAT WILL NEVER OCCUR.
BUT CAN'T WE PUT SAFETY INTOTHE SYSTEM FOR THOSE THAT
DON'T HAVE IT?
>> WELL, IT'S A UTOPIANIDEAL IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE
IDEAL IS TO GET MONEY, BIGMONEY OUT OF POLITICS
FOREVER.
BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TOFIGHT, LOOK AT
McCAIN-FEINGOLD.
WE GOT A LOT OF BIG MONEYOUT FOR ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN
YEARS.
LOOK AT SOME OF THEPROGRESSIVE, EARLY
PROGRESSIVE REFORMS THAT GOTBIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS
FOR 8, 9, TEN YEARS.
IT'S A CONSCIOUS FIGHT, ITIS A CONSTANT FIGHT AND YOU
HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING.
>> Jon: I THINK PEOPLE NEEDTO VIEW IT IN THAT MANNER.
ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGSIS IF SOMETHING ISN'T GOING
TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMCOMPLETELY, THEN IT FEELS
AS THOUGH IT'S NOT WORTHDOING.
AND THE SECOND PART OF THATQUESTION IS YOU HAVE A HUGE
CHUNK OF PEOPLE IN THEGOVERNMENT NOW, WHO HAVE A
VERY EASY JOB, WHICH IS THEYSAY GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK.
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HELPPEOPLE.
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE OF IT,I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT
ANY SUGGESTION OR PROGRAMTHAT THEY CREATE I CAN
SABOTAGE AND SUBVERT ANDTHEN POINT TO THAT PROGRAM'S
FAILURE AS MORE EVIDENCE OFMY PREVIOUS THEORY THAT
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WORK.
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
>> Jon: SO IF YOU ARE ABLETO DO THAT, THEN OF COURSE
THERE WILL BE NO LEGISLATIVE -->> AND IF YOU CONVINCE
PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THEPEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE
BE ACTIVIST THAT THERE IS NOHOPE, THAT THEY, THEY OUGHT
TO BE CYNICAL BECAUSEEVERYTHING IS JUST CRAP.
>> Jon: UH-HUH.
>> WELL, THEN YOU ARECREATING SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY BECAUSE IF PEOPLEGIVE UP ON POLITICS,
FIGURING THEY ARE GIVING UPON DEMOCRACY WHICH IS THE
APPLIED FORM OF POLITICS ANDIF THEY GIVE UP ON
DEMOCRACY -- THEY ARE CEDING THE ENTIRE
GAME TO THE BIG VESTEDINTEREST, THE MONEYED
INTEREST, THE PEOPLE WHOREALLY ARE USING POLITICS
RIGHT NOW TO ENTRENCH THEIROWN SELF AND THEIR OWN
SELF-INTEREST.
>> Jon: I AM GOING TO THROWSOMETHING OUT HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS.
THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF ARADICAL IDEA.
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN USEDOR AT LEAST FLOATED IN
AFRICA.
IT'S A WAY AS A BULWARKAGAINST CORRUPTION.
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TO SOMEOF THE STRONGMEN IN AFRICA
IS RUN YOUR COUNTRY ANDREACH A CERTAIN METRIC IN
TERMS OF ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT AND THE MONEY
THAT IS GIVEN TO YOU, ORTHAT YOU RAISE IN YOUR
COUNTRY THAT GETS TO THEPEOPLE, AND DIMINISH
CORRUPTION.
AND THERE IS A PILE OF MONEYWAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE
DONE.
THERE'S A -->> YOU INCENTIVIZE-- .
>> Jon: CORRECT.
>> NONCORRUPTION.
>> Jon: CORRECT.
>> YOU CORRUPT PEOPLE WITHNONCORRUPTION.
>> Jon: CORRECT, YEAH, YOUCORRUPT THEM WITH
NON-- HERE'S THE THING.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.
THEY WANT THAT CASH.
>> THEY WANT MONEY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
SO SAY IF YOU DO THE RIGHTTHING FOR FIVE YEARS, HERE'S
SOME MONEY.
WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR CONGRESSPEOPLE.
>> WELL, THEY ALREADY HAVEIT.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO,.
BUT THEY HAVE IT ASLOBBYISTS TO GO BACK INTO
THE GOVERNMENT TO CORRODEIT FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
WHAT IF WE SAID INSTEAD OFHAVING TO TAKE WHATEVER
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU'REGOING TO GET FROM WHATEVER
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY,WHATEVER, IS GOING TO PAY TO
LOBBY, WE SET UP A FUND THATIF YOU SERVE FOR FIVE YEARS
OR TEN YEARS WITHDISTINCTION FOR THE PEOPLE,
THERE IS MONEY WAITING FORYOU THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE FROM SHITHEADS.
(APPLAUSE)WHAT ABOUT THAT?
>> IN OTHER WORDS,.
>> Jon: WE INCENTIVIZE THEM.
>> IT'S A BE RESPONSIBLE THEWAY YOU SHOULD BE FUND
AND-- .
>> Jon: IT'S PAY PEOPLE TOACT LIKE THEY SHOULD BE
ACTING ON OUR BEHALF RATHERTHAN USING THEIR
CONGRESSIONAL -->> BUT WHY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE
BE ACTING ON OUR BEHALF THEWAY THEY OUGHT TO BE DOING
IT ANYWAY.
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAYTHEM TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF.
>> Jon: BUT-- LISTEN, TINKERBELL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO TELLYOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE REAL
WORLD.
BECAUSE THAT HASN'T WORKED.
LOOK IT, THERE'S TOO MUCHOUT THERE FOR THAT.
>> I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARESAYING, JON, BUT I'LL TELL
YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,I WAS AN INTERN, YOU TALK
ABOUT INTERNSBEFORE ON THE SHOW, FOR
ROBERT KENNEDY IN 1967.
>> Jon: HOW AMAZING-- CAN IJUST STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
HE'S MY IDOL, HE'S MYIDOL IN POLITICAL TIMES AND
MORAL TIMES, WHAT WAS THATLIKE?
>> IT WAS FABULOUS.
IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
IT WAS WHERE I GOT MYIDEALISM FROM.
I MEAN IF YOU-- WE HADGIANTS WALKING IN THIS
COUNTRY, MARTIN LUTHER KING,ROBERT KENNEDY.
WE HAD PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLYCARED ABOUT THE PUBLIC
INTEREST BUT WERE WILLING TOGIVE IT ALL, ULTIMATELY,
SADLY, TRAGICALLY THEY DIDGIVE IT ALL.
BUT WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THATNOW?
WHY CAN'T WE EXPECT OURPUBLIC SERVANTS TO BE TRULY
GREAT.
>> Jon: DO WE ALLOW THAT,UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT AND THE
GLARE THAT THEY FACE NOW,WOULD OUR GIANTS HAVE BEEN
GIANTS.
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT WEB SITESAND THINGS AND SHITHEADS
LIKE ME.
YOU GOT ALL THIS STUFF GOINGAT THEM AT ALL TIMES, WOULD
THEY BE THE GIANTS WEREMEMBER THEM AS?
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTINGQUESTION.
I MEAN THE 24/7 NEWS CYCLEAND THE KIND OF GOTCHA
JOURNALISM DOES CUTEVERYBODY DOWN TO SIZE.
BUT I DO THINK THE PUBLICNOT ONLY HATES THE KIND OF
ANTAGONISM, VITRIOL,PARTISANSHIP
THE PUBLIC ISALSO DESPERATE FOR PEOPLE
WITH INTEGRITY.
>> Jon: BUT THERE WAS AMORAL CLARITY TO THOSE TIMES
THAT I FEEL LIKE WE DON'THAVE.
AND I'M NOT A GLASSY EYEDNOSTALGIST. I
DON'T THINK BACK LIKE THE'60s MAN, THAT IS WHERE IT
WAS IT.
>> IT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME INTHIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: AND THE DIVISION.
I GOT SOME CLARITY OVERSEASA LITTLE BIT.
AND I CAN'T PRETEND THATBEING IMMERSED IN THE
CULTURE OF THEMIDDLE EASTFOR TWO MONTHS IS A REAL
EDUCATION IN THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW, IN THE SENSEOF IN THIS COUNTRY WE PLAY
UP THE DIVIDE.
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE DIVIDEIN THIS COUNTRY.
SOME PEOPLE WATCH DUCKDYNASTY BUT OTHER PEOPLE
WATCH JERSEY SHORE, YOUKNOW.
IN THOSE COUNTRIES THEY'REGRAPPLING WITH THINGS LIKE
SOME PEOPLE THINK WOMENSHOULD BE KILLED IF THEY
CHEAT ON THEIR HUSBANDS, YOUKNOW.
THAT'S A DIVIDE.
WE'VE ANSWERED IN THISCOUNTRY A LOT OF THE REALLY
BIG QUESTIONS.
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD ALSO GETSOME PERSPECTIVE.
>> BUT I THINK THAT'SEXACTLY RIGHT.
IN THE 1960s, THAT CIVILRIGHTS STRUGGLE, THAT WAS A
HUGE DIVIDE.
GO BACK TO THE 50s, JOEMcCARTHY AND HIS COMMUNIST
WITCH-HUNTS OR THE VIETNAMWAR, WHICH I REMEMBER
DISTINCTLY AND REMEMBERPEOPLE, FAMILIES SPLIT.
THOSE WERE ERAS WHEN WE HADBIG DIVIDES.
RIGHT NOW, COME ON.
I MEAN WE HAVE PARTISANSHIP,WE HAVE VITRIOL BUT THE
THINGS THAT DIVIDE US ARE SOMUCH SMALLER.
I THINK THE VITRIOL,HONESTLY, JON, COMES FROM SO
MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO GETAHEAD, WORKING SO HARD,
GETTING NOWHERE.
THEY ARE ANGRY, FRUSTRATED.
AND THEY ARE VERYSUSCEPTIBLE TO DEMAGOGUES.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU THINK SOMEOF THE VITRIOL ALSO
RELATES TO THE IDEA THATTHAT IS WHAT SELLS IN THIS
TIME?
THAT CONFLICT IS A WONDERFULMOTIVATOR FOR RATINGS AND
CABLE AND THOSE TYPES OFTHINGS.
AND THAT ENDS UP BEINGREFLECTED IN THE ATTITUDES
AND MENTALITY OF A LOT OFPEOPLE WHO THEN BELIEVE
WE'RE MAYBE A LITTLE MOREDIVIDED THAT THAN WE MIGHT
POSSIBLY BE.
>> A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IWAS ON A NEWS SHOW,
REPORTEDLY A NEWS SHOWDEBATING AN ECONOMIST WHO
WAS A REPUBLICAN ECONOMIST.
AND WE ACTUALLY AGREED ON ALOT OF STUFF.
AND WE CAME TO THE STATIONBREAK AND IN MY EAR BUD, IN
MY EAR PIECE THE PRODUCERSAID BE ANGRIER.
I SAID I DON'T WANT TO BEANGRIER.
THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD FORTHE PUBLIC TO SEE IT.
WHY SHOULD I BE ANGRIER.
BECAUSE YOU GOT MILLIONS OFPEOPLE SURFING THROUGH
HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS ANDWILL ONLY STOP WHEN THEY SEE
A GLADIATOR CONTEST.
MUD WRESTLING.
SO YOU HAVE TO BE ANGRIER.
WE HAVE 10 SECONDS.
I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BEANGRY.
SHE SAID YOU HAVE TO BE.
AND THAT'S WHEN I LOST MYTEMPER.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: INEQUALITY FOR ALL.
PLAYS IN SELECT CITIESBEGINNING SEPTEMBER 27th.
