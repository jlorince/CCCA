THE PRESIDENT'S DUE PROCESS ONTARGETING AN AMERICAN IS.
>> WE ACT AGAINST TERRORISTS WHOPOSE A CONTINUING AND IMMINENT
THREAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> IT HAS TO BE A THREAT THAT ISSERIOUS AND THE NOT SPECULATIVE.
>> Jon: IT'S KIND OF A HIGHBAR BUT PERHAPS IF ONE
WERE TO GET MORE RABBINICAL.
>> AN IMMINENT THREAT DOES NOTREQUIRE THE UNITED STATES TO
HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT ASPECIFIC ATTACK ON U.S. PERSONS
AND INTERESTS WILL TAKE PLACE INTHE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
>> Jon: IT'S TRUE THAT THETORAH SAYS --
[LAUGHTER]-- THE THREAT MUST BE IMMINENT
AND NOT SPECULATIVE BUT TO ANALL-KNOWING OMNIPOTENT GOD A
HUNDRED YEARS PASS IN A SECONDSO ARE ALL THINGS NOT IMMINENT?
PERHAPS, I THINK --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PAPA CAN YOU HEAR ME?
[LAUGHTER]WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE TO HOLD
OURSELVES TO?
>> BEFORE ANY STRIKE IS TAKENTHERE MUST BE NEAR CERTAINTY
THAT NO CIVILIANS WILL BE KILLEDOR INJURED.
>> Jon: NEAR CERTAINTY.
HERE IS CERTAINTY AND HERE ISUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]NEAR CERTAINTY WHICH IN THE CASE
OF DRONE STRIKES IN YEMEN SINCETHAT SPEECH EQUATES TO 66%
CERTAINTY.
YES, BUT FOUR OUT OF 12 DID KILLCIVILIANS SO BASICALLY IT IS
CERTAINTY IF WE'RE TAKINGCERTAINTY PASS FAIL.
THAT'S RIGHT 66% WE GET AGENTLEMEN'S D.
BUT HERE IS THE THING.
[LAUGHTER]I THINK I'VE LEARNED THAT
THERE'S NOTHING AN AUDIENCELOVES MORE THAN A MATH JOKE
ABOUT KILLING.
[ LAUGHTER ]HERE IS THE THING --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WOW, THAT COMBINES EVERYTHING
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE US ALLHERPES?
[LAUGHTER]SO --
[LAUGHTER]-- BELIEVE ME I'M SURE THAT
TECHNOLOGY WILL COME OUT ONTELEVISIONS VERY SOON.
CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS HASAFFORDED THE ADMINISTRATION AN
AWFUL LOT OF INTERPRETIVEROOM BUT AT LEAST THIS
ADMINISTRATION KNOWS IT HAS APROBLEM AS OBAMA EXPLAINED TO
LARRY KING.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TODO IS PUT A LEGAL ARCHITECTURE
IN PLACE AND WE NEEDCONGRESSIONAL HELP TO DO THAT TO
MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY AM IREINED IN BUT ANY PRESIDENT IS
REINED IN SOME TERMS OF SOME OFTHE DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING.
>> Jon: WOW, LARRY KING LOOKSLIKE (bleep) EVEN FOR HIM.
HE LOOKS --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT IS IN THAT?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME?
[LAUGHTER]I WAS YOUNG ONCE.
[LAUGHTER]BUT THE POINT IS THE PRESIDENT
WANTS CONGRESS TO HELP STOP THISMADNESS.
WHICH IS WHY LAST WEEK WHICHSENATOR CARL LEVIN OF MICHIGAN
TRIED TO HOLD A HEARING ON THETOPIC THE WHITE HOUSE DID
NOT ALLOW C.I.A. OFFICIALS TOATTEND AND DID NOT GIVE
SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR THOSEBRIEFED ON DRONES.
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE FIRSTSTEP TO GETTING HELP IS MAKING
SURE NO ONE SHOWS UP TO THEINTERVENTION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
