>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE DIRECTOR OF MANY GREAT FILMS.
HIS LATEST IS CALLED "TRANCE."
>> STOP RIGHT THERE.
STEP BACK.
REMEMBER DO NOT BE A HERO.
>> PUT IT DOWN.
NO PIECE OF ART IS WORTH A HUMAN LIFE.
>> ARGH!
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK DANNY BOYLE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> AND YOU, VERY NICE TO BE HERE.
THANK YOU.
>> Jon: BIG FAN OF YOURS, MY FRIEND.
THIS FILM, WOW.
IT IS --
>>
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: IT'S -- HOW DID YOU COME TO FIND THIS BIT OF -- IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN
TOYING WITH A LITTLE BIT, THIS IDEA OF WHAT REALITY IS?
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU ARE FASCINATED WITH?
>> I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WONDERFUL ABOUT CINEMA THAT AUTOMATICALLY BLURS THAT
BOUNDARY WE IMAGINE EXISTS BETWEEN REALITY AND ILLUSION.
IT'S ALWAYS AN ILLUSION.
YOU CRY AND LAST.
THEY ARE JUST ACTORS, YOU KNOW.
YOU KIND OF GET INVOLVED IN THE STORIES SO YOU -- IT'S THE TRANCE REALLY.
IT'S A CHANCE TO MAKE A FILM THAT SAY SERIES OF TRANCES THAT GO ON AND TAKE YOU DEEPER AND
DEEPER INSIDE THE HUMAN MIND.
>> Jon: HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THAT PUZZLE?
IS IT SOMETHING YOU HAVE IN THE PREPLANNING OR SOMETHING YOU FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH AS YOU GO ALONG?
DO YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE TWISTS AND TURNS LIE?
>> WHEN YOU DO A MOVIE LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHRONOLOGY, HOW IT REALLY WORKS OUT.
WE MESS WITH TIME, PAST, FUTURE AND PRESENT.
THEY ARE MIXED UP.
THERE'S ONE TO TELL YOU WHICH IS WHICH.
YOU NEED A CHRONOLOGY TO KNOW THERE'S A PATTERN THAT MAKES SENSE.
WHEN THE ACTORS GET CONFUSED -- AND THEY DID -- THEY COULD LOOK AT THE MAP ON THE WALL OF WHERE
THEY WERE MEANT TO BE AND THEY ARE LIKE I'M THERE.
THEY WERE FINE.
>> Jon: THEY NEVER SAID, DANNY IS THIS SNREEL DID THIS HAPPEN?
AT THE SAME TIME YOU WERE DOING THE OLYMPICS?
YES?
>> YES, THE OPENING CEREMONY.
WE TOOK A HIATUS.
WE TOOK EIGHT WEEKS OFF FROM THE OLYMPICS TO MAKE THE FILM.
>> Jon: IN YOUR MIND WHAT TOOK MORE PLANNING THE OLYMPICS.
YOU HAD ONE NIGHT TO GET IT DONE?
THIS SAY LIVE EVENT.
WHERE DO YOU FEEL MORE PRESSURE?
THE ONE NIGHT EVENT OR THE LONGER FORM PIECES THAT STAND?
>> I THOUGHT MOVIE MAKING IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.
IT'S SUCH A HUGE THING THE OLYMPIC THING.
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED.
IT'S A LABORIOUS PROCESS, TOOK SO LONG.
IT TOOK TWO AND A HALF YEARS.
PROVIDED YOU CAN DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO PEOPLE TALKING IN ACRONYMS.
>> Jon: IS THAT WHAT THEY DO?
>> YOU SPEND MOST OF THE MEETING TRYING TO WOK OUT WHAT THE ACRONYM MEANT.
BY THE TIME YOU'VE DONE THAT IT'S TIME FOR THE NEXT MEETING.
>> Jon: DO THEY INTERFERE WITH CONTENT?
DO THEY GIVE YOU NOTES LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE DO BETTER WITH THE AZERBAIJAN CONTINGENT?
>> THE SUCCESS WE HAD WITH SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE IS WHAT I GOT THE JOB.
YOU SAY IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT I'LL WALK AWAY.
AND YOU SEE THEM AND GO MAYBE THAT WON'T READ GOOD IN THE PAPERS TOMORROW IF I'M THE GUY
BLAMED FOR MAKING HIM WALK AWAY.
>> Jon: WAS IT HARD TO FIGURE OUT THAT WAS WHAT COULD YOU USE?
>> NO, YOU KNEW THAT STRAIGHT AWAY.
>> Jon: YOU WORKED WITH THE QUEEN.
YES.
>> YES, WE DID.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T PULL THAT (bleep) WITH HER.
I ASSUME SHE'S A CHARMING WOMAN.
>> SHE'S TERRIFIC ACTUALLY.
SHE ANSWERS ANYTHING.
INITIALLY WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THE IDEA.
>> Jon: DANIEL CRAIG JUMPING OUT OF THE PLANE.
>> WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE -- WE SAID WE'LL USE A DOUBLE AND GET HELEN MIRREN AND THEY SAID
NO WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT AND HER MAJESTY WOULD LIKE TO PLAY HERSELF.
THAT WAS A SURREAL MOMENT.
YOU GO, NO I THINK WE'VE BEEN HACKED BY A NEWSPAPER IN BRITAIN.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> SHE DID IT AND WE WENT THERE ON THE DAY AND WE SHOT THE SCENE IN THE KIND OF GREETING ROOM,
THE PRESENTATIONAL ROOM WHERE SHE MEETS HEADS OF STATE.
SHE LIVES NEXT DOOR.
SHE ASKED ME TO GO THERE.
IT'S LIKE A REGULAR PLACE CUSHIONS AND TEA TRAYS AND NEWSPAPERS EVERY WHERE.
SHE GOT UP AND SAID HELLO.
>> Jon: IS IT A NECESSARY IS LIKE WHEN YOU WALK IN ARE YOU LIKE?
[LAUGHTER]
REALLY, YOU DON'T HAVE A JAR FOR THE HARD CANDY, YOU LEAVE IT ON THE FLOOR.
>> SHE GOT UP AND SAID, I'VE BEEN AT THE DENTIST ALL MORNING SO I'M NOT IN A VERY GOOD MOOD.
WHAT DO YOU WANT KNOW DO.
AND SHE DID IT.
IT WAS FANTASTIC.
I THINK THE REASON SHE DID IT IS I THINK SHE WANTED A DAY OUT OF THE DAY JOB.
SHE WANTED TIME OFF LIKE TO MAKE A MOVIE WITH A MANY OFY STAR DANIEL CRAIG.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> IT WAS GREAT.
SHE WANTED ALL HER STAFF IN IT.
I LOVED HER FOR.
THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED HER FOR 20, 30 YEARS SHE WANTED THEM TO HAVE THEIR PICTURE TAKE WITHIN
DANIEL CRAIG.
THEY PUT IT ON ROYAL FACEBOOK, WHATEVER IT IS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
WE DON'T GET ACCESS TO THAT.
THEY SEND THE PICTURE AROUND.
IT WAS A DAY OUT, YOU KNOW?
>> Jon: YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTING TO BE THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND.
WILD STORY.
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN MEMORIES OF A LIFETIME IF THEY DID IN FACT OCCUR.
>> YES IT WAS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU HAVE TO SEE "TRANCE" IT'S IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY.
DANNY BOYLE, EVERYBODY.
