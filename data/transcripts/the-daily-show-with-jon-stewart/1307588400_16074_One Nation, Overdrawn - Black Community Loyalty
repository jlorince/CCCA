[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HE WAS HALF RIGHT.
FOR MORE ON THE RECESSION'S
EFFECT ON AFRICAN AMERICAN, WE
GO TO OUR SENIOR BLACK
CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE.
LARRY?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LARRY, 96% OF BLACKS WHO COULD
VOTE VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA.
96%.
NOW THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY
BEING LEFT OUT IN THE COLD
ECONOMICALLY.
>> HE COULD LOSE THE BLACK VOTE.
>> Jon: YES, LOSE IT.
REALLY?
>> OH, YEAH, JON.
IF HE CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THIS
ECONOMY, THEN GOOD BUY 96%,
HELLO 94%.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO ECONOMY BE DAMNED.
BLACK COMMUNITY IS STILL
SUPPORTING THIS GUY.
>> LET ME CLEAR SOMETHING UP,
JON, I VOTED FOR OBAMA BECAUSE
HE WAS BLACK.
IS HE STILL BLACK?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I THINK HE'S STILL
BLACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER
WHAT, THE BLACK COMMUNITY WOULD
STAY LOYAL TO A BLACK PRESIDENT?
>> WELL, NOT JUST A BLACK
PRESIDENT, JON, A DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: WHAT?
WHY?
>> LOYALTY.
WE DANCE WITH WHO BROUGHT US.
LOOK, THE REPUBLICANS FREED THE
SLAVES, WE VOTED FOR THEM FOR
100 YEARS.
THEN THE DEMOCRATS PASSED THE
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, SO THAT'S BEEN
GOOD FOR DAMN NEAR FIDDY.
>> Jon: HOW DO THEY ENFORCE
THIS UNIFORMITY, THIS BLOC?
>> MOSTLY PEER PRESSURE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HOW IS PEER
PRESSURE... IT'S A SECRET
BALLOT?
>> NOT IN BLACK PRECINCTS IT'S
NOT, JON.
OH, NO.
SEE, JON, WHITE PEOPLE VOTE LIKE
THIS.
BUT BROTHERS, MAN, BROTHERS BE
TALKING AT THE BALLOT BOX, "YOU
BETTER BE VOTING FOR THE BLACK
PRESIDENT, NEGRO.
DON'T MAKE ME COME IN THERE."
>> Jon: LARRY, PLEASE.
>> THEY'RE HAVING A DEF JAM
REUNION.
I WAS WORKING OUT SOME STUFF.
>> Jon: ARE THERE STILL
CONCERNS FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY
AS UNIFYING AS SLAVERY AND
SETTING RATION?
>> NOT REALLY.
THESE DAYS CLASS IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN RACE.
LIKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
MY KIDS DON'T NEED IT.
MY DAUGHTER TOOK A SPOT FROM A
WHITE KID AT PRINCETON, HE HAS A
RIGHT TO BE UPSET.
GOOD LUCK, BABY.
>> Jon: SO YOU THINK VOTING
MONOWILLITICALLY HAS HURT THE
BLACK COMMUNITY'S VOTING POWER?
>> OF COURSE, JON.
THIS IS THE LAST TIME.
IT'S TIME THAT THE BLACK
COMMUNITY'S POLITICAL STRUCTURE
REFLECT THE I HAVE TERSE -- THE
DIVERSITY.
IF YOU'RE A BLACK CONSERVATIVE
GUN-SHY ABOUT JOINING THE TEA
PARTY, START THE SWEET TEA
PARTY.
I DON'T CARE.
>> Jon: AND LIBERAL BLACKS
COULD HAVE LIKE
MOVIN'-ON-UP-DOT-ORG.
>> UH-UH.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO YOU THINK THE BLACK
COMMUNITY SHOULD VOTE THEIR
INDIVIDUAL SELF-INTEREST, EVEN
IF THAT MEANINGS VOTING
REPUBLICAN?
>> SURE, JON.
THERE'S A LOT OF REPUBLICANS I
CAN SEE SUPPORTING.
WHO IS THAT BROTHER WHO DELIVERS
THE PIZZA?
>> Jon: THAT'S HERMAN CAIN.
HE'S NOT A DELIVERY GUY.
HE'S THE FORMER C.E.O. OF
GODFATHER'S PIZZA.
>> DOES HE STILL HAVE ACCESS TO
PIZZAS?
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
>> I COULD SUPPORT HIM.
MAYBE THEY CAN THROW IN A TWO
LITER...
>> Jon: ARE YOU PLACING AN
ORDER, LARRY IN
>> YEAH, DAMN RIGHT, JON.
YOU WANT SOMETHING?
>> Jon: NO, I DON'T.
LARRY, THANK YOU.
LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY.
