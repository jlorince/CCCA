>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT.
MY GUEST ROBIN ROBERTS.
AS ALWAYS BEFORE THE SHOW I'MJUST SCRIBBLING THE PHRASE
"NI HAO" FOR NO APPARENT REASON.BUT FIRST, THERE'S NOT MUCH IN
THE WORLD I TRULY LOVE IN THISWORLD, MY FAMILY, MY
COUNTRY, MY PRICELESS COLLECTIONOF ANTIQUE CERAMIC CATS.
HELLO MORRIS AND MORRIS.
BUT ABOVE ALL MY HEART BELONGSTO MY BELOVED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]SO WHEN I TUNED INTO HIS PROGRAM
LAST NIGHT, AS I DO EVERYNIGHT --
[LAUGHTER]-- IT WAS KIND OF A GOOD NEWS,
BAD NEWS SITUATION.
>> TONIGHT I'M TAKING ON THEEVER SO FUNNY JON STEWART OF THE
"THE DAILY SHOW".STEWART AND HIS FRIENDS AT
COMEDY CENTRAL,THEY ARE THE CHIEF APOLOGISTS
FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.HE DOES SUCK UP A LOT.
YOU KNOW THE MORE I THINK ABOUTIT, I GUESS,
I CAN'T EXPECT A COMEDIC HACKAND HIS ARMY OF WRITERS, I CAN'T
TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OHMY GOD, OH MY GOD. WAIT!
WAIT. WAIT WAIT.
JUST WAIT.
SEAN HANNITY KNOWS MY NAME.
[ LAUGHTER ]I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE
HACK THING HURTS A LITTLE, BUTTHE WOUND IS HEALED BY THE
OINTMENT OF YOUR ATTENTION. YOUSEE WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
[LAUGHTER]SEAN THERE, WELL, HE WAS UPSET
THAT ON MONDAY I MAY HAVEMENTIONED THAT HE WAS BEING
HYPOCRITICAL IN DEFENDING THENEVADA RANCHER AND MILITANT
FEDERAL GRAZING FEE NOT PAYERCLIVEN BUNDY.
I AM SYMPATHETIC TO CRITICS OFEMINENT DOMAIN AND THOSE WHO
FEEL THAT OBAMA'S JACK BOOTEDTHUGS SHOULD NEVER HAVE SIGNED
THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER EXTENDING
THOSE FEDERAL GRAZING FEESINDEFINITELY.
I'M SORRY, DID I SAY OBAMA?
I MEANT RONALD REAGAN.
[LAUGHTER]THAT'S BESIDES THE THE POINT.
OF COURSE, ACCORDING TO HANNITYHIS SUPPORT OF CLIVEN ISN'T EVEN
ABOUT RULE OF LAW.
>> CAN I MAKE MY POSITION MORECLEAR TO MR. STEWART?  I STAND
FOR PROPORTIONALITY.I THOUGHT THERE WAS A LACK OF
PROPORTIONALITY HERE BY THEGOVERNMENT, AND SNIPERS
IN SURROUNDING YOUR RANCH ANDTAKING YOUR CATTLE.
>> Jon: IT'S PROPORTIONALITY HEIS UPSET ABOUT. PORTION CONTROL.
THE GOVERNMENT IS OVERREACTINGWHICH THEY TEND TO DO WHEN 20
YEARS OF ATTEMPTS TO COLLECTMONEY INCLUDING FOUR SEPARATE
COURT JUDGMENTS ARE IGNORED ANDTHE OWER MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED HE
HAS WEAPONS AND IS VOWING TO DOWHATEVER IT TAKES WITH HIS WIFE
ADDING THAT SHE HAS A LOADEDSHOTGUN AND IS READY TO DO WHAT
WE HAVE TO DO.
I'M SURE THE GOVERNMENT IF THEYTRIED ONE MORE TIME SENT A
COUPLE MORE GUYS UP THERE WITH ASWISS ARMY KNIFE AND ONE OF
THOSE CREDIT CARD SWIPERS, I'MSURE WE COULD SETTLE THIS
REASONABLY.
BECAUSE SEAN HANNITY IS FORPROPORTIONALITY WHEN DEALING
WITH DISSENT. LIKEWHEN A POLICE OFFICER
GENERALLY SEASONED NONVIOLENTPROTESTERS AT UC DAVIS.
>> IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THAT'SA LOT OF PEPPER SPRAY.
>> IT WAS A LOT OF PEPPER SPRAY.
>> DID THEY CROSS THE LINE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
[AUDIENCE BOOS]>> Jon: NO, THAT WAS
PROPORTIONAL.
IN FACT, THEY COULDN'T HAVECROSSED THE LINE BECAUSE I
DIDN'T EVEN SEE A LINE BECAUSEMY (bleep) EYES WERE BURNING
BECAUSE I HAD JUST HAD A PEPPERSPRAY SHOWER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]SO THAT -- THAT IS A RESPONSIBLE
EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY.
I MEAN THOSE PEOPLE WERE CLEARLYTHERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHICH I BELIEVE IS PROVOCATION
ENOUGH. THE PROTESTERS WERE
IN POSSESSION OF BUTTSWITH INTENT TO SIT.
SO THAT SRIRACHA BOUCHACHI WASENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. SRIRACHA,
BY THE WAY, TRADEMARK PHRASE.
