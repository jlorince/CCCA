BUT WAIT -- HOW DID THESEINCREDIBLY NOT RACIST PEOPLE
FIND THEMSELVES IN THECROSSHAIRS OF HAVING TO EXPLAIN
HOW RACIST THEY AREN'T.
>> THE MEDIA MAYBE TWISTS THINGA LITTLE BIT.
>> YOU GUYS TRY TO MAKEEVERYBODY IN THE WORLD THINK I'M
PREJUDICED. I'M NOT PREJUDICED.
>> Jon: AH THE MEDIA IS TWISTINGIT AROUND TO MAKE YOU SEEM --
THEY'RE JUST TAKING IT OVERHERE, TAKING IT OVER HERE --BLOOP.
I MEAN IF THEY WOULD JUST PLAYTHE WHOLE TAPE THEY WOULD SEE HE
SAYS THE NEGRO MAY HAVE BEENBETTER UNDER SLAVERY WHICH IS
A LINE HE WROTE IN A NEW PLAYCALLED LES MISERACISTS.
SO IF YOU KNOW ANY JEWTHEATER PRODUCERS -- WHAT STOP
TWISTING MY WORDS! NOW, OFCOURSE, DONALD STERLING HAS YET
TO EXPLAIN WHY HE IS NOTTO BLAME FOR HIS RACIST
STATEMENTS. BUT ANOTHERBILLIONAIRE DONALD IS MORE THAN
HAPPY TO SUGGEST -- WAIT --[LAUGHTER]
-- MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUGGESTSTERLING IS NOT THE ONLY ONE AT
FAULT HERE.
>> HE GOT SET UP BY A VERY, VERYBAD GIRLFRIEND, LET'S FACE IT.
SHE WAS BAITING HIM.
SHE'S A TERRIBLE HUMAN BEING ANDSHE'S CALLED THE GIRLFRIEND FROM
HELL.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHY I RECOMMENDTO ALL MY WEALTHY OLD FRIENDS
THAT THEY DATE TRUMP BRAND GOLDDIGGING GIRLFRIENDS. I PROMISE
THE BEST GIRLFRIENDS GOLDDIGGING MONEY CAN BUY.
RETURN POLICY CAN'T BE BEAT. WHOAM I KIDDING?
WE ALL KNOW WHERE THE BLAME FORRACISM REALLY BELONGS.
>> IF I SAY NEGRO OR BLACK BOYOR SLAVE, I'M NOT -- IF THOSE
PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE THOSE KIND OFWORDS AND NOT BE OFFENSIVE THEN
MARTIN LUTHER KING HASN'T GOTHIS JOB DONE YET.
>> Jon: YEAH!
IT'S HIS FAULT.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHY DID THAT GUY QUIT BEFORE
FINISHING HIS JOB?
[LAUGHTER]SOMEBODY SHOULD CALL HIM AND
TELL HIM TO STOP SLACKING ANDGET BACK TO WORK ON THE JOB OF
ENDING RACISM.
HERE IS THE THING ABOUT RACISMIN THIS COUNTRY, THE REACTION TO
STERLING AND BUNDY, THEOVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION MAKES
IT CLEAR WE HAVE MADEENORMOUS PROGRESS IN TEACHING
EVERYONE THAT RACISM IS BAD.
WHERE WE SEEM TO HAVE DROPPEDTHE BALL IS IN TEACHING PEOPLE
WHAT RACISM ACTUALLY IS, WHICHALLOWS PEOPLE TO SAY THESE
INCREDIBLY RACIST THINGS WHILSTINSISTING THEY WOULD NEVER.
I BELIEVE THE BEST ENCAPSULATIONOF THIS COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
COMES IN ALMOST CARTOON FORM.
I GIVE YOU TWO KLANSMENDISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM A
MURDEROUS WHITE SUPREMACIST WHOWENT ON A SHOOTING SPREE AT A
JEWISH CENTER.
>> WE ARE NOT A HATE GROUP.
I HAVE A LOT OF BLACKFRIENDS.
I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMESTO LAYING DOWN WITH THEM WE
SHOULD BE SEPARATE.
BUT AS FOR AS A HATE GROUP, WEDID NOT HATE ANYONE.
>> Jon: OH, SO I GUESS THE ROBES  ARE A KIND OF A KITSCH HIPSTER
THING.
YOU ARE NOT KLANSMEN YOU ARE IN"KLANSMEN."
COME BACK TO MY PLACEI'VE GOT SOME VINTAGE MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS IN REAL 40s MILKBOTTLES.
AND THAT BURNING CROSS?
RECLAIMED FREE TRADE BARN WOOD.
[LAUGHTER]BUT THE REAL KEY HERE WAS THEIR
STATEMENT THAT THEY HAVE BLACKFRIENDS, THEY JUST DON'T BELIEVE
IN SEXUAL MIXING, WHICH SHOWS, ITHINK, THE RICH TAPESTRY, THE
GORGEOUS MOSAIC OF RACISM INAMERICA, ALL THE WAY FROM
THOSE WHO SAY YOUCAN (bleep)
THEM, JUST DON'T BE SEEN WITHTHEM TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU CAN BE
SEEN WITH THEM, JUST DON'T(bleep) THEM.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
