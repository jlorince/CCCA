>> Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT,AUTHOR HIS NEW BOOK IS
CALLED JIM HENSON, THEBIOGRAPHY, WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM BRIAN JAY JONES.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANKS, GREAT TO BE HERE.
>> YOU KNOW, JIM HENSON, THEBIOGRAPHY, HERE WAS FOR ME I
THINK ALMOST THE MOSTSTUNNING PART.
IT'S BEEN OVER 20 YEARS.
>> YEAH.
>> SINCE JIM HENSON'S DEATH.
>> YEAH, AND FOR A LOT OFPEOPLE IT STILL SEEMS LIKE
YESTERDAY.
THAT MATH I THINK REALLYSTUNS PEOPLE SOMETIMES.
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE.
AND I STILL REMEMBER, YOUKNOW, THERE ARE ALWAYS
PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY PASSAWAY YOU THINK OH, THAT WAS
A GOOD MAN, THAT'S A SHAME.
BUT BOY, HE LEFT A BIG HOLE.
>> MAN.
>> YEAH.
>> IN EVERYBODY'S HEART.
I MEAN IT WAS REALLY VERYSPECIAL GUY.
>> YEAH.
I MEAN THERE IS A REASONTHAT EVERYONE STILL KNOWS
AND LOVES THE MUPPETS ANDTHAT DISNEY IS REBOOTING
THEM AND TRYING TO GET THEMBACK IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS.
IT'S A HUGE LEGACY, THAT HEDID AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT IT IN AVERY SHORT TIME.
>> AND WHAT'S FUNNY, YOUKNOW, WE HAVE SUCH MEMORIES
OF IT.
AND YET AS YOU GO THROUGHTHE BOOK YOU GO OH, RIGHT,
THE ORIGINAL SHOW WAS HOSTEDBY A PUPPET NAMED NIGEL.
>> RIGHT.
AND HE CALLED IT SEX ANDVIOLENCE.
>>I REMEMBERTHINKING THAT DOESN'T
SOUND RIGHT AT ALL.
THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK.
>> THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK.
>> IT TOOK HIM, THAT WAS AREAL STUDY IN STICK TO
ITIVENESS FOR HIM.
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLEWHO WOULD PUT OUT A PILOT, HAVE
IT FAIL, AND ANOTHER AND ITDOESN'T TAKE HOLD AND
DOES IT AGAIN AND ITFINALLY CATCHES ON.
>> AND THE STRANGE THING ISHOW IT CATCHES ON.
YOU KNOW, "SATURDAY NIGHTLIVE" WHICH IS THIS
INCREDIBLE COUNTERCULTUREAND EXPLOSIVE, SATIRICAL NEW
WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS, IMEAN REALLY CREATED A WHOLE
DIFFERENT GENRE OFTELEVISION AND THEN HERE IS
THIS GUY WITH HIS PUPPETS.
>> YEAH, HE'S ON THERE.
AND JOHN BELUSHI CALLED THEMTHE MUCKING FUPPETS
THEY HATED SHARING AIRTIME WITH THEM AND IT WAS
SORT OF A BAD DNA BETWEENTHE MUPPETS AND SNL
MENTALITY.
IT TURNED OUT OKAY.
THE MUPPET SHOW CAME ALONG THEFIRST SEASON AND THEY COULD
WAVE GOOD-BYE NICELY.
BUT THE TEAM DID SEND APOSTCARD BACK FROM LONDON
AND SAY WHATEVER HAPPENED TOTHE MUCKING FUPPETS, HERE WE
ARE, BIGGEST SHOW IN THEWORLD.
AND JIM HENSON HAD THE SOUL,THIS GUY HAD ARTIST SOUL AND
INVENTOR SOUL AND REALLY ABIT OF A RENAISSANCE MAN.
>> YEAH.
AND DID IT ALL IT WAS SORTOF CREATIVELY RESTLESS.
THROUGHOUT THE '60s HEWANTED TO DO AN INFLATABLE
NIGHTCLUB AND DROP IT IN ANALLEY IN NEW YORK CITY AND
BRING DOWN WOMEN IN WHITELEOTARDS AND
PROJECT MOVIES ON THEM ANDPLAY MUSIC.
>> EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCEWAS GOING, WHERE IS THIS
PLACE.
I WILL GO THERE.
>> AND THE TECHNOLOGY WASN'TTHERE FOR HIM YET.
HE WAS A LITTLE TOO FARAHEAD OF THE CURVE A LOT OF
THE TIME.
HE IS DOING SORT OF HIPPIEDOCUMENTARIES AND HE'S DOING
SORT OF TWILIGHT ZONIE SHORTSPECIALS FOR NBC.
AND FINALLY THE EXCLAMATIONPOINT AT THE END OF THE '60s
IS WE KNOW "SESAME STREET"COMES ALONG. BUT EVEN HE SAYS IN
THE 60S, YOU KNOW I HAD TWOCAREERS GOING, I WAS AN
EXPERIMENTAL FILMMAKER ANDTHEN I HAD THE MUPPETS.
THE MUPPETS FINALLY TOOKHOLD.
>> BUT THE FUSION OF THE TWOIS ALMOST WHY IT WORKED.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WATCH THEMUPPETS, THERE WAS-- IT
DIDN'T HAVE THECONDESCENSION OR THE SORT OF
STRANGE ADOLESCENT NATURE OFMAY BE SOME OF THE OTHER
PUPPET THINGS.
IT WAS INFUSED WITH A VERYSOPHISTICATED AND
SUBVERSIVE SENSE.
>> NOT TOO TIRED AN NOT TOOSWEET.
THAT SWEET SPOT BETWEENLOONEY TUNES AND DISNEY, AND
YOU KNOW, THE MUPPETS AREFUN AND THEY'RE FAMILY.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHYPEOPLE REALLY ENDED UP
LOVING THEM.
THE RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE,THE MUPPET SHOW WITH KERMIT
IS KIND OF THE EYE OF THEHURRICANE, THAT WAS THE WAY
IT WAS WITH JIM.
HE WAS THE EYE OF THAT HURRICANE THE GLUE THAT HELD
THEM ALL TOGETHER.
IT WAS CRAZY, HE WASINSTIGATING SOMETIMES BUT
BROUGHT THEM ALL BACKTOGETHER AND THAT IS REALLY
WHAT MADE THEM ALL WORK, JIMLOVED TO WORK.
IT WAS ALWAYS FUN AND THATSHOWS UP.
>> AND HE WAS THE IRON MAN.
THAT IS WHY I THINK HISDEATH WAS SO STUNNING, A,
THAT IT WAS SO ABRUPT ANDSUDDEN AND HE HAD BEEN SO
HEALTHY.
AND I STILL REMEMBER, BOY,IF YOU WANT A GOOD CRYFEST
GO ON YOUTUBE AND FINDHENSON FUNERAL BECAUSE
THIS IS, PEOPLE ARE INSHOCK.
AND THERE'S THE PUPPETS.
I MEAN IT IS ONE OF THE FEWTIMES YOU CAN REALLY BRING A
PUPPET TO A FUNERAL.
>> RIGHT.
>> AND IN HIS ABSENCE IS NOTABLE IN THERE YOU
I MEAN YOU AREREALLY MISSING HIM WHEN
YOU SEE THAT IT ISHEARTBREAKING.
>> IT IS HEARTBREAKING.
AND IT IS, I ALWAYS USED TOTHINK I WILL GO TO THE
DOCTOR, LIKE THREE DAYSEARLIER THAT IS NOT REALLY
THE CASE.
>> IT WAS SO SEVERE, BY THETIME THE SYMPTOMS WERE
SHOWING SOME SAID IT WAS SOSTRONG BY THE TIME SYMPTOMS
SHOWED UP IT WAS PROBABLYTOO LATE ANYWAY. IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE THINGS, MOSTGUYS WOULD SAY RIDE IT OUT.
I'LL BE FINE.
>> I'M THAT WAY, IF I GETSICK, NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.
I WILL SLEEP THERE.
>> EXACTLY.
>> WELL, I'M REALLY GLAD,YOU KNOW, IT STRIKES ME THE
FIRST TIME ANYBODY HASREALLY CATALOGED HIS LIFE
AND PUT IT OUT THERE AND ITIS A WONDERFUL MEMOIR.
>> THANK YOU.
>> A WONDERFUL MEMORY FORHIM.
