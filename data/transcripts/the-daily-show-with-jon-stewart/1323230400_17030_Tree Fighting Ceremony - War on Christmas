7-ELEVEN DOES TODAY.
YEAH, WE'RE OPEN.
FOX, YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED THE
UBIQUITY OF CHRISTMAS.
BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN A WAR,
CHRISTMAS IS THE AGGRESSOR
NATION.
RIGHT NOW EVERY PUBLIC SPACE IN
THE COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE IT GOT
HIT WITH A 500-POUND TINSEL
BOMB.
THE WHITE HOUSE LOOKS LIKE A
YULETIDE EPISODE OF HOARDERS."
(LAUGHTER)
MANY OF THESE DISPLAYS ARE
SUBSIDIZED BY... WHAT'S THAT
THING YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND ON
ANYTHING?
TAXPAYER MONEY!
YOU WANT TO FIGHT ABOUT
SOMETHING TAKING THE CHRIST OUT
OF CHRISTMAS?
♪ ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS
YOU... ♪
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS THE REASON
FOR THE SEASON, IT DOES NOT
INVOLVE MARIAH CAREY IN A HALF A
SANTA SUIT PRESENTING HER ASS TO
JUSTIN BIEBER LIKE A HORNY BONO
BOW.
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE WAY, WHAT IF WE ALL DID
GO BACK TO ALWAYS CALLING THEM
AS CHRISTMAS TREES AND SAYING
"MERRY CHRISTMAS"?
WOULD THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS, NOW SOME
RETAILERS ARE GOING BACK TO
USING THE WORD "CHRISTMAS"
AGAIN, BUT ARE THEY DOING IT
JUST TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK?
AND IF SO, ARE YOU OKAY WITH
THAT?
>> Jon: WE CAN'T WIN.
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, SURE THEY'RE SAYING
"MERRY CHRISTMAS" BUT DO THEY
MEAN IT?
AND THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO MEAN
IT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT JESUS IS
THEIR SAVIOR?
THAT IS WHY TONIGHT I MUST MAKE
THE HARDEST DECISION THAT ANY
ANCHOR OF A FAKE NEWS PROGRAM
HAS TO MAKE.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE UNUSUALLY BOISTEROUS FOR
AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF WAR.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, TONIGHT I
HUMBLY COME BEFORE YOU TO
DECLARE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
WE DID NOT... SURE.
WE DID NOT ASK FOR THIS WAR, BUT
NEITHER WILL WE SHRINK FROM IT.
IT IS SAID THAT WE PROVOKED
THESE HOSTILITIES THROUGH OUR
USE OF THE PHRASE "HAPPY
HOLIDAYS."
THIS IS A LIE.
THAT WAS A PHRASE BORNE NOT OF
AGGRESSION BUT OF CONVENIENCE.
BUT AS LONG AS OUR ENEMIES VIEW
THE WORD HAPPY HOLIDAYS NOT AS A
WAY TO AVOID THE TIME SUCKING
DOUBLE SALUTATION "I WISH YOU A
HEARRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW
YEAR" BUT RATHER AS A SUBTEX
WALL "(BLEEP) YOU AND YOUR BABY
JESUS" THERE CAN BE NO PEACE!
(LAUGHTER)
WE NOW ASK THAT CHRISTMAS
IMMEDIATELY AND UNILATERALLY
WITHDRAW TO ITS PRE-'67 BORDERS.
PRE1667 BORDERS.
DO THIS NOW.
THAT WAS MY NIXON!
NO!
NO!
YOU DON'T DESERVE MY NIXON.
(LAUGHTER).
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DO THIS NOW OR FACE THE FULL
NIGHT OF OUR SECULAR
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
IT'S A... NO, THAT'S NOT A
PRESIDENT.
IT'S A WORLD WHERE CHRISTMAS
WILL HAVE TO SHARE STATEHOUSE
ROTUNDAS NOT JUST WITH JEWS BUT
WITH HINDUS, BUDDHISTS, WICCANS,
SANTERIA, ATHEISTS AND, OF
COURSE, MUSLIMS.
(LAUGHTER)
WE WILL FIGHT UNTIL WE LIVE IN A
WORLD WHERE FREE AMERICANS
EVERYWHERE SEEK NOT VALIDATION
OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
THROUGH MACY'S SIGNAGE.
WHERE NONSECTARIAN GREETINGS ARE
NOT SEEN AS DIMINISHING THE THE
MOST UBIQUITOUS TWO-MONTH
HOLIDAY IMMERSION SINCE
CALIGULA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.
(LAUGHTER)
UNTIL THAT DAY, I WISH YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY IN THIS SEASON A
HAPPY AND HEART FELT END OF THE
FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
