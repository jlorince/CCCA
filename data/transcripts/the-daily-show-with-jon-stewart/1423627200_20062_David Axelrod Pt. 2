>> Jon: WELCOME BACK! WE'RE HEREWITH DAVID AXELROD!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BELIEVE,
"BELIEVER," YOUR BOOK.
WHO DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENTHATES MORE, THE MEDIA OR THE
CONGRESS?
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY JUST IN TERMSOF PURE, UNADULTERATED WOULD
LIKE TO RIP THEIR FACES OFF?
>> IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THEDAY, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: SO IT'S AN UP AND DOWN.AN UP AND DOWN.
>> LOOK, THERE'S NO DOUBT THATTHERE ARE A LOT OF FRUSTRATIONS
ASSOCIATED -- YOU KNOW,ESPECIALLY --
HIS BASIC VIEW IS WE'VE GOTEIGHT YEARS TO TRY AND DEAL WITH
BIG PROBLEMS.
WHEN HE RAN HE SAID WE'VE GOT TOFOCUS ON THE NEXT GENERATION AND
NOT JUST THE NEXT ELECTION.HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT,
THAT WASN'T JUST A LINE IN ACAMPAIGN.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO HE GETS FRUSTRATED --
>> Jon: BUT HE'S NOT UNWILLINGTO BE PRAGMATIC OR TO --
>> HAVE TO BE.
>> Jon: TO SUBVERT THE IDEALSFOR POLITICAL, YOU KNOW,
THE GAY MARRIAGE SITUATION,HE BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE OKAY
BUT HAS TO TAKE APOSITION THAT HE DOESN'T.
>> BUT ENDS UP, BUT ENDSUP MOVING GAY RIGHTS MORE THAN
ANY PRESIDENT EVER HAS.
GOT RID OF DON'T ASK DON'TTELL --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)GOT RID OF DOMA --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND ULTIMATELY PUT GAY
MARRIAGE IN A POSITION TOSUCCEED, SO YOU KNOW,
THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE TODO IN POLITICS BUT THAT IS
DIFFERENT THAN THE SMALLPOLITICS OF WASHINGTON THAT WE
GET SO CONSUMED IN -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITHANYTHING IN THE LONG TERM.
THE OTHER DAY I WAS ON A SHOWAND SOMEONE SAID, WHY IS THE
PRESIDENT FOCUSING ON CLIMATECHANGE?
IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL NBC POLL ON
PEOPLE'S CONCERNS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I HAD JUST HAD AGRANDDAUGHTER AND I WAS THINKING
TO MYSELF, WHAT ARE WE -- AM IGOING TO TELL HER
FROM THE GRAVE AT THE END OF THECENTURY WHEN SHE'S STILL ALIVE
AND THE PLANET IS DEGRADED, YOUKNOW, WE WOULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, BUT ITJUST DIDN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF
IMPORTANCE OF THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL NBC POLL?
BUT THAT'S HOW, THAT'SHOW WASHINGTON THINKS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THAT'S HIS FRUSTRATION.
>> Jon: YOU'RE A, YOU'RE A DARKDUDE.
(APPLAUSE)WHEN HE GETS IN THERE, IT SEEMS
LIKE HE EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THEDEMOCRATIC PARTY TO SOME EXTENT.
HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE LEADEROF THE PARTY.
THEY ALL RAN AWAY FROM HIM INTHE MIDTERMS.
HE -- YOU KNOW, WHO DOES HECALL?
YOU KNOW, FAMOUSLY, BILL CLINTONHAD A TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH
REPUBLICANS, BUT HE WOULDCALL NEWT GINGRICH AT NIGHT.
WHO'S THAT GUY FOR PRESIDENTOBAMA?
IS IT A DEMOCRAT, A REPUBLICAN?
I DON'T SENSE ANY RAPPORT WITHANY PARTICULAR POLITICIAN OR
LEGISLATOR DOWN THERE.
>> YEAH. NO, I DON'T THINK-- LOOK, HE HAS ASSOCIATIONS
IN CONGRESS. YOU KNOW, SENATORCOBURN, WHO IS QUITE
CONSERVATIVE WAS A FRIEND OF HISAND HE TALKED WITH HIM FROM TIME
TO TIME.
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND HE'S GONE.
>> HE IS GONE.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT UMM -- >> Jon: SO THERE WAS THAT GUY.
>> YES. YEAH. HE --
>> Jon: NOBODY ELSE?
>> IT'S VERY LONELY NOW.>> Jon: REALLY?
>> NO. NO, NO. YOU KNOW, I --
LOOK, HE TALKS TO PELOSI, HETALKS TO OTHER MEMBERS,
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN AND SO ON.
>> Jon: BUT THERE'S TENSION. ITFEELS LIKE, IT FEELS LIKE THEY
DON'T NECESSARILY GETALONG, THERE'S AN ISSUE THERE.
>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY AS ISAID BEFORE THAT THERE'S
FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT SORT OF WHATMOTIVATES SOME OF THE FOLKS ON
THE HILL. AND YOU KNOW, SENATORSCHUMER SAID, YOU PROBABLY SAW
THE SPEECH, HE SAID, WELL, YOUKNOW, HEALTHCARE WAS A GREAT
THING BUT HE SHOULDN'THAVE DONE IT BECAUSE
THE POLITICS WERE BAD.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE PRESIDENT JUST DOESN'T --HE DOESN'T THINK THAT WAY.
AND, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF --
>> Jon: BUT EVEN YOU SAID THAT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED HIM TODO.
>> RIGHT, AND HE OVERROAD ME.
AND I ALWAYS SAY I LIKE HIM SOMUCH BECAUSE HE
LISTENED TO ME SO LITTLE.
>> Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE HESEEMS LIBERATED BY THE DEMOCRATS
LOSS OF CONGRESS REALLY IT LOOKSLIKE A GUY YOUR SENIOR YEAR,
MAYBE THOSE LAST THREE MONTHS,YOU KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY
BEEN ACCEPTED TO A UNIVERSITY --MAYBE, MAYBE --
>> EXCEPT HE'LL STILLSHOW UP FOR CLASS. YEAH, YEAH.
>> Jon: HE STILL SHOWS UP FORCLASS, BUT HE'S GOT, YOU'VE GOT
THAT SENSE LIKE HE'S LIKE HEY,I'M OUT OF HERE --
>> OH, TOTALLY. I HAVE TO SAY,I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR 20-SOME-ODD
YEARS -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM MOREENERGIZED THEN HE IS RIGHT NOW.
AND PART OF IT IS THAT HE MAYSNIFF THE FINISH LINE.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT I THINK A LOT OF IT ISTHAT HE THINKS HE CAN GET
BIG THINGS DONE.
JUST SINCE THE ELECTION WHEN HEWAS PRONOUNCED DEAD --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> HE MADE A MAJOR ADVANCEON CLIMATE CHANGE,
HE BEGAN TO NORMALIZERELATIONS WITH CUBA.
HE TOOK A BIG STEP ONIMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> Jon: DID HE HAVE TO WAITTILL THE MIDTERMS FOR THAT?
IS THAT SOMETHING BECAUSE THEPOLITICS CHANGED HE ACTUALLY
COULDN'T HAVE PULLED THE TRIGGERON THOSE THINGS BEFORE THE
MIDTERMS?
>> I THINK HE WAS ASKED AND THISHAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HIM,
I'M NOT REVEALING ANYTHING, THESENATE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO MOVE ON IMMIGRATION REFORMUNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION AND HE
HONORED THAT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATEFOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
SENATOR MENENDEZ WAS DEEPLYOPPOSED TO ANY CHANGE
IN THE CUBA POLICY. HE WASNO LONGER THE CHAIRMAN
AFTER THE ELECTION. THATMADE THAT EASIER.
SO HE MADE, THERE'S NO DOUBTTHAT HE MADE ACCOMMODATIONS TO
HIS MAJORITY, HIS PARTY'SMAJORITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND HE DOESN'T HAVETHAT BURDEN RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND IS IT GOINGTO BE HARD FOR HIM, BEFORE HE
GOES BECAUSE THE TIME IS RUNNINGOUT TO IMPOSE SHARIA LAW?
IS THAT GOING TO BE DIFFICULTFOR HIM AS A TYRANNICAL KING?
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM GOINGTO STUDY HOW YOU GET 97% OF THE
VOTE.(LAUGHTER)
I NEVER WAS ABLE TO --
>> Jon: THE GUY HAD EXCELLENTADVISORS.
