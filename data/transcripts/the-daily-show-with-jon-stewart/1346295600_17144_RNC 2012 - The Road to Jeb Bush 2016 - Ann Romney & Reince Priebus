MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE'S REPUBLICAN OF TAMPA THE
REPUBLICANS FACED THE DIFFICULT CHALLENGE OF THEIR OWN.
COULD THEY FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD MAKE AMERICA LOVE MITT ROMNEY?
>> I COULD TELL YOU WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM.
HE WAS TALL, LAUGHED A LOT.
HE WAS NERVOUS, GIRLS LIKED THAT, IT SHOWS THE GUY'S A LITTLE INTIMIDATED.
HE WAS NICE TO MY PARENTS BUT HE WAS ALSO REALLY GLAD WHEN THEY WEREN'T AROUND.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WELL, LISTEN, YOU SEEM KIND OF CHARMING SO I CAN GET WHY HE'S INTO YOU.
BUT UNLESS THERE'S TIME IN THIS CAMPAIGN FOR MITT ROMNEY TO TAKE
US ALL TO A DANCE I DON'T THINK THE LOVE THING IS HAPPENING.
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE US FALL IN LOVE WITH MITT ROMNEY, WHAT ABOUT HATE FOR THE OTHER GUY?
R.N.C. CHAIR REINCE PRIEBUS.
>> BARACK OBAMA THINKS THE GOVERNMENT IS AT THE CENTER OF THE ECONOMIC UNIVERSE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NEVER RUN A COMPANY!
HE HASN'T EVEN RUN A GARAGE SALE OR SEEN THE INSIDE OF A LEM NATE STAND!
>> Jon: WOW.
I GOTTA SAY, IF THE TONE YOU WERE GOING FOR THERE WAS ANGRY DRUNK GUY...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ... YOU NAILED IT.
(AS ANGRY DRUNK GUY) AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT... I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT BARACK OBAMA.
(LAUGHTER) HE'S AN ASS (BLEEP).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THIS GUY'S NAME ISN'T REINCE PRIEBUS,
IT'S RYAN PETERSON AND HE'S ALWAYS TOO (BLEEP)ED UP WHEN HE SAYS IT TO PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) (AS DRUNK GUY) WHAT'S MY NAME?
MY NAME IS REINCE PRIEBUS.
(LAUGHTER)
