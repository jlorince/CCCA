IT'S ACTUALLY JUST 16 LONDON LUNCH BUDDIES.
(LAUGHTER) JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHAT WOULD PUBLIC E-MAILS LOOK LIKE WITH A SCHEME SUCH AS THIS?
>> TRADERS E-MAILING EACH OTHER SAYING "HEY, I REALLY NEED YOU
TO... I REALLY NEED MY RATES TO COME IN AT A CERTAIN RATE.
IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN I'M GOING TO GET KILLED." (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SO THESE E-MAILS,
TRADERS FOR THESE BANKS WOULD CALL UP THE BANK OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH REPORTING THEIR
BANK'S LIBOR BORROWING RATE AND ASK THESE INDIVIDUALS TO LIE.
JUST A LITTLE.
ABOUT THE RATE.
WHAT DO E-MAILS LOOK LIKE POST-LYE.
>> QUOTE, DUDE, I OWE YOU BIG TIME.
COME OVER AFTER WORK AND I'M OPENING A BOTTLE OF BOLLINGER.
>>"
>> WHEN I WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THIS YOUR NAME WILL BE IN GOLDEN LETTERS.
THE REPLY FROM LONDON?
"I WOULD PREFER THIS NOT BE IN ANY BOOK." (APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT IT BEING IN AN INDICTMENT?
(LAUGHTER) WHO WHO IS RUNNING THESE BANKS?
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?
>> RICH RICHIE, HE IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENIOR PERSON AT BARCLAYS.
BOB DIMON FIRED AMID THE LIBOR SCANDAL.
>> Jon: ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING ME?
NO.
RICH RICHIE?
AND MR. DIAMOND?
(LAUGHTER) IS THIS REAL OR A DICKENS NOVEL?
HERE'S HOW WEIRD THIS STORY IS.
ONE OF THE FEW GOOD GUYS IN THE STORY IS A BANKER WHO DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE RIGGING OF RATES.
HIS NAME?
ALEXANDER HOARE.
(LAUGHTER) HE'S A SCION OF LONDON'S ESTEEM HOARE AND COMPANY.
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
EVEN THE HOARES ARE DISGUSTED.
AN EIGHTH-GENERATION HOARE FROM A LONG LINE OF LONDON HOARES.
>> EARLIER WE TOLD YOU THE THREE THINGS WE'D ALL HEARD ABOUT THAT
WERE KILLING OUR ECONOMY WERE,
NUMBER ONE OVERREGULATION.
>> THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THE BANKS SUBMIT THAT DATA.
>> Jon: OKAY, SO NOT OVERREGULATION IN THIS CASE.
SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE LIKE UNDERREGULATION.
SO IT MUST BE THE NUMBER-TWO REASON, THE UNCERTAINTY IN THINGS LIKE OBAMACARE AND
DODD-FRANK THAT'S KILLING US.
>> THEY'RE MONK KISS AROUND WITH LIBOR.
I TALKED TO ONE FRIEND WHO WORKS ON WALL STREET HE SAID "THIS IS
LIKE FINDING OUT THE WHOLE WORLD IS BUILT ON QUICKSAND."
>> Jon: OKAY, SO AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT'S BUILT ON.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S A TYPE OF CERTAINTY SO AN UNREGULATED FREE MARKET CAN ALSO
APPARENTLY CREATE UNCERTAINTY AND SOME BANKERS MADE A FEW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
BETWEEN EACH OTHER RIGGING THEIR BESTS ON INTEREST RATES AND KEPT INTEREST RATES ARTIFICIALLY LOW
DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.
IT STILL DOESN'T EXCUSE ECONOMY-WRECKING REASON NUMBER THREE-- PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS AND
THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE WITH THEIR MASSIVE PENSION DEMANDS.
>> THE VICTIMS IN THIS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT ARE THE MUNICIPALITIES AND THE CITIES
AND ANYBODY WHO GOT PAID LESS THAN A FAIR MARKET INTEREST RATE ON BONDS
>> OH, RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) THE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS ARE UNDERFUNDED IN PART BECAUSE THE
BONDS THEY OWN ARE PAYING TOO LOW A YIELD THANKS TO 16 SUITED TURD MONKEYS IN LONDON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THE CITY OF BALTIMORE AND THE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE UNION OF
NEW BRITAIN, CONNECTICUT, HAVE ALREADY FILED A LAWSUIT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OR TWO MILLION
DOLLARS, THAT'S A FIRE COMPANY.
>> Jon: YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU TAKE OUT A MORTGAGE TO REBUILD YOUR BURNED-DOWN HOUSE
