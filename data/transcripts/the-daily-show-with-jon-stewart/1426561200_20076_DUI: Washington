>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, EARLIERTHIS MONTH, THIS VERY MONTH,
THERE WAS A BIT OF AN INCIDENTINVOLVING THE SECRET SERVICE
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

>> TWO AGENTS CRASHED INTOTHE WHITE HOUSE.
>> OUT OF CONTROL.>> STUNNING NEW DETAILS.

>> RAN INTO A BARRICADE.>> SLAMMED --
>> PLOWED THEIRGOVERNMENT CAR --
>> WASTED, DRIVING,RUNNING INTO THINGS.
>> A DRUNKEN CRASH, REALLY.
>> Jon: THE WHITE HOUSEUNDER SIEGE BY JEALOUS
KILLER CAR.
THIS STORY PUTS THE FOCUS ONTWO MAJOR INSTITUTIONS.
THE SECRET SERVICE AND AND THENEWS MEDIA.
(LAUGHTER)
IT TURNS OUT, NEITHER OF THEMARE VERY GOOD AT THEIR JOBS.
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT RIGMAROLEUP TOP THERE,
HERE'S WHAT ACTUALLYHAPPENED.
>> TWO SENIOR AGENTS ALLEGEDLYDROVE A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE
INTO A WHITE HOUSE BARRICADELAST WEEK AFTER A NIGHT OF
DRINKING.
>> THEY ARE MOVING-- PRETTYGLACIAL PACE IN THIS
CAR, THEY ARE GOING PRETTYSLOW.
THEY PUSH AND NUDGE ATEMPORARY BARRELS WITH THEIR
CAR.
>> THERE WAS NO CRASH, NODAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE.
>> Jon: HOW COULD THERE BENO CRASH AND NO DAMAGE DID
YOU HEAR EARLIER, DID YOUHEAR THAT THUMPING DAMAGE
BEAT.
>> TWO AGENTS CRASHED INTOTHE WHITE HOUSE, ALLEGEDLY
DRIVING DRUNK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LOOK, DRUNK DRIVING ISINEXCUSABLE BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE THESE GUYS LITERALLYCRASHED INTO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
EVEN THE ANIMATEDSIMULATIONS OF THE ACCIDENT
MAKE IT APPEAR LESSDANGEROUS--
(LAUGHTER) THEN WHEN A
PERFECTLY GOOD DRIVER ISJUST TRYING TO GET HIS KIDS
TO SCHOOL ON TIME.
SO THEY DON'T GET HIT WITHANOTHER LATE SLIP, AND THERE HAS
TO BE A PARENT'S MEETINGWITH THE VICE PRINCIPAL.
I'M TOLD.
SO HOW COME WHEN THE NEWSREPORTED AND THIS, IT
SOUNDED MORE LIKE THIS?
>> I'M CRASHING THE GATE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I KNOW IT'S
CONFUSING BECAUSE BOTH "WHITEHOUSE DOWN" AND NOW HAVE
BLACK PRESIDENTS BUT THATWAS A MOVIE.
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
AS FOR THE SECRET SERVICE, IT'SREALLY JUST THE LATEST IN A
STRING OF PROBLEMS INCLUDINGTHE RECENT WHITE HOUSE FENCE
JUMPER, AN AGENT PASSING OUTDRUNK IN A DUTCH HOTEL
HALLWAY, AND A PROSTITUTIONSCANDAL IN CARTAGENA WHERE
AGENTS BROKE THE SACRED RULEOF PLACING O'S BEFORE HOS.
AND OF COURSE THERE WASTHAT TIME WHEN THEY
MISPLACED ALL THEIR SUNGLASSESAND HAD TO WEAR THE GOOGLEY
EYES.
CLEARLY BOTH OF THESEORGANIZATIONS NEED AN
INTERVENTION.
SECRET SERVICE, NEWS MEDIA,MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE.
SECRET SERVICE, STOP DRINKING SO
[BLEEP] MUCH.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS, YOUCOULD BE THE GREAT AGENCY YOU
ONCE WERE.
NOW TO THE NEWS MEDIA.
WHAT ARE YOU [BLEEP] DRUNK?
I WISH YOU WERE DRUNK.
IT WOULD EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS.
ALL YOUR HYPERBOLE ANDEVERYTHING ELSE, BECAUSE I
COULD JUST IMAGINE THE NEWSMEDIA IN THE BACK ALL DRUNK
GOING HEY, [BLEEP] WHAT,  THEREWAS A CRASH AT THE WHITE HOUSE,
SOME DUDE, DOING 80, LET'SORDER A PIZZA AND NOW WE'RE ALL
[BLEEP] UP, GIVE PIERS ISMORGAN A SHOW, WHY NOT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
