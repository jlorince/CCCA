SO WITH SENATORS APPARENTLY
RIPPING ONE ANOTHER HEARTS OUT,
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SENATE IS
GOING NUCLEAR.
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET A FEW
THINGS OFF MY CHEST MYSELF.
I HAD A GAY EXPERIENCE IN
COLLEGE.
TECHNICALLY I WAS 31 BUT IT
HAPPENED AT THE COLLEGE.
WHAT ELSE?
I DON'T LIKE ARTICHOKES.
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.
AND IF ANYONE EVER DISCOVERS THE
MUTILATED BODY OF A VAGRANT.
>> THE SENATE HAS REACHED A DEAL
TO REACH THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR
OPTION.
>> THEN I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
SERIOUSLY?
HOW DID THE NUCLEAR OPTION GET
AVERTED?
>> A SMALLER GROUP OF SENATORS
LIKE BY McCAIN AND SHEUMER
HAVE HAMMERED THIS OUT.
TWO OF THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES
WILL BE WITHDRAWN.
TWO NEW NAMES OFFERED AND FIVE
OTHERS WILL GO FORWARD.
>> John: SO A ROUTINE BIT OF
HORSE TRADING.
ALL IT TOOK TO GET THERE WAS
WEEKS OF THREATS AND HYPERBOLIC
RHETORIC ABOUT ENDING THE
SENATE.
I PRESUME YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.
>> THERE'S GOOD NEWS.
WHAT IT REFLECTS IS NOT ONLY
RESPECT FOR THE SENATE RULES BUT
REALLY AN UNDERSTANDING THAT TO
GET SOLUTIONS, WE'VE GOT TO WORK
IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.
>> THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN
IN A LONG TIME SENATORS OF BOTH
POLITICAL PEARS SIT DOWN AND
HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT.
>> John: I GUESS THAT IS
TECHNICALLY BETTER.
YES, WE HAVE COME TO REACH NEXT
TO NOTHING BUT WE DID IT
TOGETHER.
FOR MORE ON THIS, WE TURN TO
SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL
CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES WHO IS
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.
JASON, THE FILIBUSTER HAS BEEN
PRESERVED FOR NOW.
SO IT SEEMS WE WON'T SEE THE
PREDICTED DISSENT INTO GRIDLOCK
AND CHAOS THEN.
>> GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS.
HOW WOULD THAT BE WORSE THAN THE
CURRENT SITUATION?
THE SENATE DREAMS OF THE DAY
THINGS IMPROVE TO A STATE OF
GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS.
>> John: IS IT REALLY THAT BAD
THERE?
>> JOHN, JOHN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
ALL THIS STUFF IS?
THESE ARE SENATE BILLS WAITING
TO COME UP TO THE FLOOR FOR A
VOTE.
LOOK HOW OLD THEY ARE.
LOOK AT THIS THING HERE.
LOOK AT THIS.
THE FAIR SLAVE PRICING ACT OF
1852.
THIS ONE HERE.
BAN THIS NEW JAZZ CRAZE BILL.
LOOK AT THIS ONE.
A BILL TO GRANT THE
CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF ALL
AROUND GREAT GUYS TO O.J.
[BLEEP] SIMPSON.
IF THE SENATORS WERE SMART THEY
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THE
FILIBUSTER COMPLETELY.
>> John: NOT PROPOSING TO GET
RID OF ALL FILIBUSTERS JUST ONES
BLOCKING NON-LIFETIME EXECUTIVE
APPOINTMENTS.
>> THAT'S TRYING TO CURB FIREARM
VIOLENCE BY BANNING T-SHIRT
GUNS.
TRYING TO PUT OUT A VOLCANO BY
TAKING A PISS IN IT.
THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD
SCHOOL FILIBUSTER.
>> John: WHEN THEY HAD TO TALK
FOR HOURS AND HOURS WITHOUT
GETTING A BATHROOM BREAK.
>> LIKE REAL MEN.
LIKE WENDY DAVIS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> John: I HONORLY DON'T KNOW IF
THEY CAN DO THAT, JASON.
REMEMBER THESE ARE MOSTLY OLD
MEN.
THERE IS NO WAY THEY CAN STAND
THERE FOR HOURS WITHOUT LEAVING
TO GET TO A BATHROOM.
>> Reporter: YES, THEY CAN.
WE REPORTERS, WE DO IT ALL THE
TIME.
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, JASON,
JASON.
HOW ARE YOU LOOPING THAT?
JASON, WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT
DIAPER?
>> Reporter: I CAN'T HAVE YOU
THROW TO DEAD AIR BECAUSE I'M IN
THE BATHROOM DRAINING THE SNAKE.
THE SNAKE DID DRAINED ANYWHERE.
SNAKE DON'T MIND.
SNAKE'S COOL.
>> John: PLEASE, PLEASE.
STOP REFERRING TO YOUR PENIS AS
A SNAKE.
>> Reporter: SHHH.
HE CAN HEAR YOU.
BUT THE POINT IS, IF I CAN BE
OUT HERE IN A DIAPER, WHY CAN'T
MITCH McCONNELL?
SNON BECAUSE THAT SEEMS BENEATH
THE DIGNITY OF THE SENATE.
>> Reporter: YOU REALLY THINK
MITCH McCONNELL [BLEEP] INTO
AN ADULT-SIZED HUGEES IS LESS
DIGNIFIED THAN THE WAY THE
CURRENT IS OPERATING.
>> John: YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT A
POINT THERE,
