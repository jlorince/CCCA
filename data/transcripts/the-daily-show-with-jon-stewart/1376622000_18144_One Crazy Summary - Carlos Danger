SAID.
AND FINALLY--
(APPLAUSE)
>> FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO
PERSONALLY SAY A BIG THANK
YOU TONIGHT BECAUSE THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE
GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO
MAKE MY JOB SO MUCH EASIER
THIS SUMMER THAN IT COULD
HAVE BEEN.
AND ONE IN PARTICULAR.
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE B
ANTHONY WEINER.
OR-- OR SHOULD I SAY CARLOS
DANGER.
>> DANGER.
>> THE REAL-- NOW THIS WEEK
HE JOINS THE OTHER
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR
MAYOR IN A TELEVISED DEBATE
USING HIS TIME TO SAY THIS.
>> MY NAME IS ANTHONY WEINER
AND I WANT TO BE YOUR MAYOR.
>> NOW A COUPLE OF THINGS
STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT, FIRST,
DOES ANTHONY WEINER REALLY
THINKS HE NEEDS TO TELL
PEOPLE HIS NAME ANY MORE?
BECAUSE WHILE THERE ARE MANY
OBSTACLES TO HIS GETTING
ELECTED, NAME RECOGNITION IS
DEFINITELY NOT ONE OF THEM.
AND SECOND, DOES HE WANT TO
BE MAYOR?
BECAUSE THE WAY HE IS BEEN
CAMPAIGNING RECENTLY IT KIND
OF SEEMS LIKE HE MIGHT NOT.
CASE IN POINT, EARLIER THIS
WEEK HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO
THE WEB SITE BUZZ FEED.
>> I THINK YOU CAN DO THIS.
>> I THINK IS
SOMETHING-- YOU CAN DO THIS
OR SHOW VIDEOS OF CATS,
WHATEVER YOU DO AT BUZZ FEED
BUT --
>> WHAT'S HE DOING?
IT IS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO
MAKE PEOPLE HATE HIM NOW.
I CAN'T TELL IF HE WANTS TO
BE MAYOR OR A HEEL IN THE
WWF.
SHOCKING NEW YORK, YOUR TOWN
SMELLS LIKE PISS.
CHICAGO'S GOT BETTER-- THAN
THE RED SOX.
WEINER 2013!
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS ON
THIS ABOUT THIS SUMMER.
BUT ON THIS YOU MOST OF
ALL-- MISS YOU MOST OF ALL
CARLOS DANGER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
