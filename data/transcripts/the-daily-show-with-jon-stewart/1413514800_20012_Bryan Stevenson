>> WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTTONIGHT, HE IS THE DIRECTOR
OF THE EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE,HE'S A PROFESSOR AT
NYU LAW SCHOOL, HIS NEW BOOK ISCALLED "JUST MERCY: A STORY OF
JUSTICE AND REDEMPTION."PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,
BRYAN STEVENSON. SIR!HELLO!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  [APPLAUSE]
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?  >> I'M WELL, THANK YOU.
>> Jon:  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THE BOOK IS CALLED JUST MERCY.  TELL ME ABOUT THE WORK YOU DO,
THE FOUNDATION OF THIS BOOK.  TELL ME ABOUT THE VARIETY OF
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON.
>> WELL, THE BOOK IS ABOUT MASS INCARCERATION IN AMERICA AND THE
WAY WE'VE DISCONNECTED FROM SOMANY OF THE REALITIES. IT TELLS
THE STORY OF A MAN WHO WASWRONGLY CONVICTED AND
PUT ON DEATH ROW.
AND YOU THINK THE SYSTEM WORKSONE WAY BUT ACTUALLY WORKS A
VERY DIFFERENT WAY.AND I MET THIS MAN WHO WHEN I
WENT TO THE PRISON, TOLD ME HEHAD BEEN PUT ON DEATH ROW FOR 15
MONTHS BEFORE THE TRIAL, ANDI THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TOWORK. AND THEN I GOT BACK TO MY
OFFICE AND A JUDGE NAMED ROBERTE. LEE CALLED AND TOLD
ME NOT TO TAKE THE CASE.AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S
SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND THENI WENT INTO THIS COMMUNITY WHERE
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE TELLINGME THAT THEY WERE THIS MAN 11
MILES AWAY FROM THE CRIME SCENEWHEN THE CRIME TOOK PLACE
AND HE WAS STILL CONVICTED ANDSTILL SENTENCED TO DEATH.
THE JURY RETURED 25 TO LIFE.
THE JUDGE OVERRODE IT, IMPOSED THE DEATH PENALTY.
SO THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT, ANDI THINK THE BOOK IS AN EFFORT TO
TRY TO KIND OF EXPOSE PEOPLE TOTHAT DISCONNECT.
WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT TALKS ABOUT BEING THE HOME OF THE
BRAVE AND THE LAND OF THE FREE AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
INCARCERATION RATE IN THE WORLD.
>> Jon: AND EVEN IN, YOUKNOW, JUST TODAY IN NEW YORK
CITY, A GENTLEMAN CONVICTED OFMURDER AT 16 YEARS OLD, WRONGLY
CONVICTED, IT IS 30 YEARS LATER,HE'S JUST GETTING OUT TODAY.
HIS FRIEND WHO WAS CONVICTEDWITH HIM, DIED IN PRISON.
>> YEAH.>> Jon: THERE'S A 10-YEAR-OLD
BOY NOW APPARENTLY BEING CHARGEDAS AN ADULT FOR A MURDER.
>> YEAH. YEAH. >> Jon: HOW ARE
WE AS A COLLECTION ALLOWING ITTO HAPPEN?
>> WELL, I THINK WE DON'T APPRECIATE THE OBLIGATION TO BE
JUST IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.  THERE IS THIS DISCONNECT.
AND THERE IS THIS NARRATIVE OUTTHERE CORRUPTED BY THE
POLITICS OF FEAR AND ANGER.
I MEAN, WE CHANGED DRAMATICALLYIN THE LAST 40 YEARS.
IN 1972, THERE WERE 300,000PEOPLE IN JAILS AND PRISONS.
TODAY THERE ARE 2.3 MILLION.AND THAT DISCONNECT IS
PART OF THE PROBLEM.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, WEPROTECT CHILD STATUS IN AMERICA,
AND WE'RE BEING DISHONEST  WHENWE SAY KIDS CAN'T VOTE,
CAN'T DRINK, CAN'T SMOKE BUT IF THEY COMMIT A CRIME, WE CAN
IGNORE THEIR CHILD STATUS. ANDTHAT'S WHO WE ENDED UP WITH 13
AND 14-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN SENTENCED TO DIE IN PRISON.
>> Jon: AND IT'S ALMOST NOT EVENA DISCONNECT BUT IT'S
PURPOSEFUL. I CAN REMEMBER THEPOLITICS OF FEAR THROUGHOUT
THE '70s AND EARLY '80s.>> YEAH, YEAH. SURE.
>> Jon: THAT WE WERE UNDERATTACK BY, I REMEMBER THEY USED
TO CALL THEM THE SUPER PREDATORS.
>> SUPER PREDATORS.>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT .
>> Jon:  AND WE HAD TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM SUPER PREDATORS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND THEN THE THREESTRIKES RULE  CAME IN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND ALL THESE OTHERTHINGS THAT WERE INSTITUTED.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S ANARRATIVE THAT WAS INTRODUCED.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, THESECRIMINOLOGISTS STARTED
TALKING ABOUT SUPER PREDATORS,AND THEY WERE TALKING MOSTLY
ABOUT YOUNG BLACK AND BROWN BOYSAND THEY MADE THESE PREDICTIONS,
AND WE STARTEDELIMINATING THE MINIMUM AGE
FOR TRYING A CHILD AS AN ADULT,
THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE 10-YEAR-OLDSFACING ADULT IMPRISONMENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WE MADE IT EASIER TO PUT
THESE KIDS IN PRISON FOREVER,AND THEN WE STARTED PASSING
MANDATORY SENTENCES LAWS, ANDTHAT MEANT THAT WE'VE GOT
PEOPLE SERVINGLIFE SENTENCES FOR
WRITING A BADCHECK OR DRUG USE, SIMPLE
POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND IT'S CRAZY.
BUT I THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLYBEEN  OUTRAGED ENOUGH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCARCERATION IN THE WORLD AND
WE'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THAT.
>> Jon:  NOT ONLY NOT OUTRAGED. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A
DEFENSIVENESS IN THE COMMUNITY. I HAD A GENTLEMAN ON LAST NIGHT
THAT I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH, WHO IS VERY
ADAMANT THAT RACE WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN THESE.
AND YET DISPROPORTIONATELY, ANDSTATISTICALLY IT IS.
AND WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I WASN'T TRYING
TO BLAME HIM.  JUST MERELY AND NOT VERY
ARTICULATELY, POINT OUT IT WAS REAL.
>> SURE.>> Jon: WHY IS IT SO HARD
TO GET PAST THAT DEFENSIVENESSAND ANGER?
>> WELL, WE'VE NEVER EVER COMMITTED OURSELVES TO A PROCESS
OF TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION OF OUR HISTORY.
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF A MYTH THAT
CREATED SLAVERY AND BECAUSE OF THAT SLAVERY DIDN'T END, IT
EVOLVED.  WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WHAT IT
MEANT TO TERRORIZE PEOPLE BETWEEN THE END OF
RECONSTRUCTION AND WORLD WAR II.
AND THEN WE HAD JIM CROW AND SEGREGATION AND WE DOMINATED AND
HUMILIATED PEOPLE FOR DECADES WITHOUT APPRECIATING THE HARM
DONE BY THAT. AND NOW WE'RE INAN ERA WHERE OUR FAILURE TO TALK
HONESTLY ABOUT RACE AND THELEGACY OF RACIAL INEQUALITY
CONTINUES TO HAUNT  US. THEREARE THESE PRESUMPTIONS OF
DANGEROUSNESS AND GUILT THAT AREASSIGNED TO
PEOPLE OF  COLOR, THAT'S HOWMR. MCMILLAN GOT
CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND WE'RE SO KIND OF TRAPPEDBY SILENCE, THAT IT'S HARD FOR
US, BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGETHAT. YOU KNOW, IN GERMANY,
THERE WAS THE HOLOCAUST, AHORRIFIC, HORRIFIC HISTORY.
BUT IF YOU GO THERE, YOU AREREQUIRED TO CONFRONT THAT
LEGACY.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE ARE MONUMENTS AND MEMORIALS AND THERE ARE TOTEMS
THAT MAKE YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.
IN THIS COUNTRY WE TRY TO HIDE THAT HISTORY.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND IT MANIFESTS ITSELF INTRAGIC WAYS.
>> Jon: AND THERE'S THIS SENSEOF WELL, BUT WE DON'T HAVE
SLAVERY ANYMORE, AND WE DON'THAVE SEGREGATION,
SO GET OVER IT.
THE GENTLEMAN I REFERRED TO FROMLAST NIGHT SPOKE OF THE CODIFIED
SEGREGATION OF THE 50sAND 60s AS THOUGH IT WERE
THE MIDDLE AGES -- BUT THAT WASTHE 50s AND '60s.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I STARTED MYEDUCATION IN A COLORED SCHOOL
BECAUSE SCHOOLS WERE STILLRACIALLY SEGREGATED.
THE COUNTY WHERE MY FATHERGREW UP DIDN'T HAVE A
BLACK HIGH SCHOOL.HE HAD TO LEAVE.
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS THE DAUGHTEROF PEOPLE WHO WERE ENSLAVED.
AND ALL OF THESE REALITIES HAVELASTING CONSEQUENCES.
A BLACK MALE BABY BORN INTHE 21 CENTURY, ONE IN THREE
BLACK MALE BABIES BORN INTHE 21ST CENTURY IS EXPECTED
TO GO THE JAIL OR PRISON. THATWASN'T TRUE IN THE 20th CENTURY.
THAT WASN'T TRUE IN THE 19thCENTURY.
NOW WE'VE CREATED THISENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE TO
CONFRONT MORE HONESTLY. ANDTHAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE,
TO TALK MORE HONESTLYABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> Jon: WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'REGOING TO SHOW, SO IF YOU CAN
STICK AROUND, WHEN WE COMEBACK WE'LL TALK A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT HOW THIS CONVERSATIONTAKES PLACE BECAUSE I ALMOST
THINK WE NEED INSTRUCTIONS.>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Jon: BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEENTAKING PLACE EXCEPT AMONGST
WHITE PEOPLE YELLING AT EACH OTHER.
"JUST MERCY" WILL BE ON THE BOOK SHELVES ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY.  BRYAN STEVENSON, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
