>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE.
WE'VE GOT A BIG ONE.
IT'S BIG!
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT FROZEN IN
VAIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OUR GUEST TONIGHT -- OH!
I LOST A TOE.
[LAUGHTER]
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FORMER
CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF HUGE SHELTON.
I'M GOING TO DO SOME ASKING
PERHAPS HE WILL DO SOME TELLING.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW INTERVIEWS
WORK.
BY THE WAY, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL
YOU PEOPLE SIXTH NIGHT OF
HANUKKAH.
HUH?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
REALLY?
[LAUGHTER]
PEOPLE AREN'T USUALLY THAT
ENTHUSIASTIC THIS MANY DAYS IN.
IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS THE [SPEAKING
HEBREW] THAT'S HEBREW FOR THE
NIGHT YOU GET A JIGSAW PUZZLE.
IT'S THE SIXTH NIGHT.
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS.
IN ALL.HUBBUB, THE-YEAR-OLD HANN
U-CHAOS IF YOU WILL.
THE DREIDEL BASED GAMBLING
ADDICTIONS.
COME ON GIMMEL DADDY NEEDS A NEW
LATKE GRINDER.
FUNNY LANGUAGE.
JEWS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES
CELEBRATING THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.
WHO COULD BLAME US?
THE OTHER SEASONAL HOLIDAY HAS
BEEN ALL BUT CRUSHED BY FORCES
BANDED AGAINST IT.
>> THE TULSA CHRISTMAS PARADE OF
LIGHTS HAS BEEN A TRADITION IN
OKLAHOMA FOR 70 YEARS BUT PARADE
ORGANIZERS HAVE STRIPPED THE
WORD CHRISTMAS FROM THE EVENT'S
TITLE AND CHANGED IT TO HOLIDAY
PARADE OF LIGHTS DESPITE OUTRAGE
FROM THE COMMUNITY.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!
[LAUGHTER]
THE SEASONAL PARADE IN AMERICA'S
47th LARGEST CITY CHANGED ITS
NAME.
[LAUGHTER]
LAST YEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
AND GRETCHEN APPARENTLY JUST
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND IS ABOUT TO OPEN UP A CAN OF
FREEDOM ASS ON THE CHAIRMAN OF
TULSA'S PARADE OF LIGHTS.
>> I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET A
SENSE OF WHY AFTER 70 YEARS YOU
WOULD CHANGE THE NAME.
>> WELL, AGAIN, I THINK IT WAS
TO BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT WE
WERE.
PEOPLE MAKE WAY TOO MUCH OF THE
NAME.
>> REALLY?
BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE FEEL JUST
THE OPPOSITE, LARRY.
>> WHY?
>> WHY CHANGE THE NAME.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUSINESS
DECISION LIKE A SPONSOR WAS
GOING TO PULL SUPPORTING IT
UNLESS YOU CHANGED IT TO
HOLIDAY.
>> I THINK THAT'S AN
OVERSTATEMENT.
>> WELL, THEN WHAT IS IT?
>> Jon: THEN WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A HOLIDAY PARADE TO MAKE
THE CHILDREN OF TULSA SMILE.
SANTA COMES IN AND THROWS THEM
CANADA.
WHAT -- THEM CANDY.
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO TULSA?
I'VE RUINED CHRISTMAS.
[LAUGHTER]
DBRECH SEASON NOT THROWING THE
FIRST STONE.
SHE'S THROWING --
[LAUGHTER]
REALLY?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SHE EVEN LOOKS PRETTY LIKE THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
SHE'S PRETTY.
[LAUGHTER]
SHE'S NOT THROWING THE FIRST
STONE.
SHE'S THROWING THE THIRD STONE.
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO
PARTICIPATE AS A RESULT OF IT
NOT BEING CALLED THE CHRISTMAS
PARADE.
THE ACRES OF LOVE ALPACA FARM IS
NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE AND
SENATOR JAMES INHOFE IS NOT
GOING TO PARTICIPATE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NO ALPACAS AND NO JIM
INHOFE.
NIETZSCHE WAS RIGHT, GOD IS
DEAD.
THE PARADE ISN'T THE ONLY VICTIM
HERE.
>> THE PARADE WILL NOT SUFFER IN
TERMS OF QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF
ENTERRIES.
>> MANY PEOPLE ARGUE JUST
CHRISTMAS WILL SUFFER.
>> Jon: MANY?
[LAUGHTER]
BY MANY PEOPLE DO YOU MEAN ONE
PRETTY LADY WEARING A PURPLE
SWEATER?
GRETCHEN, CHRISTMAS SURVIVED THE
ROMAN EMPIRE.
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK IT WILL HANDLE THE
RENAMING OF TULSA PRAYED.
FRANKLY, GRETCHEN, I THINK THE
BEARDED GUY YOU ARE PROTECTING
MIGHT BE THE WRONG BEARDED GUY
BUT I ADMIT THE SEASON WOULDN'T
FEEL THE SAME WITHOUT PEOPLE
GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BE
OFFENDED BY NOTHING.
[LAUGHTER]
WHEN DID ALL IN A BEGIN?
-- ALL THAT BEGIN?
WELL, HELLO, BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT?
YES,YES, SIR, I'D SAY THIS IS
SHAPING UP TO BE THE BEST
BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR JESUS YET.
THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID JESUS.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
I HOPE YOU DO BECAUSE PETTY
ARGUMENTS ABOUT A HOLIDAY
CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF OUR
SAVIOR IS AS AMERICAN AS APPLE
PIE.
IT'S CALLED THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS
AND IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR BUT IT
WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY.
STARTED OFF LIKE ANY OTHER
CHRISTMAS.
TREES WERE TRIMMED.
STOCKINGS HUNG BY THE FIREPLACE.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM, IT
SEEMED WITH ALL THE PEACE ON
EARTH AND GOODWILL TOWARDS MEN
PEOPLE PLUM FORGOT TO BE OFFEND
BY THE PETTY (bleep) THAT
DIVIDES US.
THAT'S RIGHT I SAID (bleep).
>> THIS SAYS HAPPY HOLIDAYS I'LL
TAKE THAT AS A GREETING RATHER
THAN A REJECTION OF MY FAITH.
>> CAN I PUT OUT KWANZA
DECORATIONS.
>> SURE, NO PROBLEM.
>> PULL OVER IT'S THE PC POLICE.
WHAT IS WRONG, OFFICER ARE YOU
GOING TO GIVE US A TICKET FOR
NOT INCLUDING A MENORAH IN OUR
RELIGIOUS DISPLAY?
>> NO, EVEN THOUGH I'M JEWISH
I'M SECURE ENOUGH IF MY OWN
BELIEFS THAT I DON'T NEED TO BE
INCLUDED IN ANY HOLIDAY.
>> IT LOOKED LIKE CHRISTMAS WAS
GOING TO COME AND GO WITHOUT
OUTRAGE ABOUT A CITY COUNCIL
RENAMING THE NATIVITY SCENE A
MULTIDENOMINATIONAL PARTY.
NO ONE EVEN NOTICED EXCEPT FOR
ONE SAD LITTLE BOY BECAUSE EVEN
THOUGH CHRISTMAS WAS THE MOST
DOME NANT CULTURAL EVENT IN THE
HISTORY OF CULTURAL EVENT HE
FELT EMPTY WITHOUT SOME SENSE
THAT THE PEOPLE CELEBRATING WERE
SOMEHOW BEING PERSECUTED SO HE
PRAYED.
THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID PRAYED.
BUT SAIDLY -- SADLY IT WAS ALL
FOR NOT UNTIL SOMETHING MAGICAL
HAPPENED.
FIRST IN THE DARK OF NIGHT CAME
A FLICKER.
AND THEN JUST A TICKER AND THEN
A GREAT NOISE LIKE SOMEONE JUMP
ED ON A CLICKER.
>> YOU CAN'T SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS.
AND YOU SUPPORT THE BAND.
YOU ARE THE FAISHIST.
>> THERE'S BEEN A WAR ON
CHRISTMAS FROM THE SECULAR
CHRISTMAS FOR FLEE OR FOUR
DECADES NOW.
>> THERE'S A WAR ON CHRISTMAS
WITH ATHEISTS.
>> ANTIRELIGION SIGN RIGHT NEXT
TO THE NATIVITY SCENE.
>> THE MORE PEOPLE WATCHED, THE
MORE THEY GOT SICKER, SICKER AND
SICKER UNTIL EVERY LAST ONE CAME
TO QUARREL AND BICKER.
>> ATHEIST.
>> SOCIALIST.
>> PAGAN.
>> OLD ROGER COULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT HE HEARD.
HE TOOK DELIGHT IN EACH UNKIND
WORD.
PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE SAID HIS
HEART SHE RUFRPBG THREE --
SHRUNK THREE SIZES THAT DAY.
IT IS A WERE ON CHRISTMAS
MIRACLE.
AS FOR THE LITTLE BOY WHOSE
PRAYERS HAD UNUSE THISSED HE WAS
GIVEN A SHOW RIGHT THERE ON FOX
NEWS.
>> TONIGHT ARE CHRISTIANS AN
ENDANGERED SPECIES?
ARE THE FOUNDING FATHERS WISHES
FOR CHRISTIAN AMERICA BE TRAMPLE
D UPON?
I'LL TALK TO MY ALL AMERICAN
PANEL INCLUDING SNOOPY, PIGPEN
AND STEVEN BALDWIN.
SUCK IT, CHARLIE BROWN.
>> YEAH, CHRISTMAS IS SAVED!
