WITH ROMNEY.
ALL RIGHT, NOW-- YEMEN'S A
BIT OF A DOWNER.
LET'S TRY AGAIN.
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, OW,
OW, OW, STOP, STOP OH.
>> Jon: OH, SYRIA.
DAMMIT.
>> NOW THE UPRISING OF SYRIA
DRAMATIC NEW DEECHLTS
DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING A
REVERSAL OF THE GOVERNMENT
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD,
THE SYRIAN LEADER SAYING
WILL GRANT AMNESTY TO
PROTESTORS ARRESTED FOR
VARIOUS ALLEGED CRIMES.
>> Jon: WOW.
THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF GOOD
NEWS.
ASSAD IS A BRUTAL DICTATOR
AND I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO
OFFER UP AMNESTY.
>> THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY
AN AMNESTY AS ONE WOULD
UNDERSTAND THE WORLD IN THE
SENSE THAT IT IS NOT A
BLANKET PARDON.
THOSE WHO HAD RECEIVED A
LIFE SENTENCE, FOR EXAMPLE,
WOULD BE IMPRISONED FOR 20
YEARS.
HE WOULD SEE THAT REDUCED TO
SERVING OUT A LIFE SENTENCE.
>> I SEE.
SO I THINK SOMEONE DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW WHAT THE WORD
AMNESTY MEANS.
SLOW DOWN THERE, RAINBOW
BRIGHT, THAT'S GOING TO
LEAVE YOUR RE-ELECTION
CHANCES VULNERABLE TO BEING
SOFT ON CRIME.
I GUESS TO ASSAD SAM NEST
ASH-- ADD NESTY IS JUST THE
RETURN ADDRESS ON ALL THE
JUNK MAIL HE T
