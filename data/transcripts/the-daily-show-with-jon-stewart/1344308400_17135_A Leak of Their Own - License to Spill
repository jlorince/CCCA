THERE.
IT MIGHT BE DAMAGING.
OH, YOU MEAN IT'S MILLER TIME.
DID THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LEAK CERTAIN FLATTERING INFORMATION?
I HIGHLY THINK YES.
AND I WILL SAY THIS, TOO.
ON THE FLIP SIDE, WHEN IT'S INFORMATION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION NO LIKEY, THE
SONS OF BITCHES ARE GOVERNMENT WHITION L BLOWERS.
IN FACT, OUR OWN JASON JONES HAS MORE.
>> WE HEAR A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT GOVERNMENT WASTE, BUT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE
FIGHTING FOR THE TAXPAYER, LIKE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY ANALYST THOMAS DRAKE.
>> WHEN I WAS EMPLOYED AT THE M.F.A., ONE OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES WAS TO DISCOVER
THE VERY BEST THAT EXISTED AND PUT IT INTO THE FIGHT.
AND ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS WAS SPIN THREAD.
>> AN EFFICIENT $4 MILLION INTELLIGENCE GATHERING PROGRAM.
THE PROBLEM WAS THE N.S.A.
ALREADY HAD A PROGRAM CALLED "TRAILBLAZER" THAT DIDN'T QUITE
WORK, SPIED ON AMERICANS AND WAS A TINY BIT MORE EXPENSIVE.
>> $A 3 MILLION PROGRAM MADE A $4 BILLION PROGRAM LOOK PRETTY BAD.
>> AND AFTER HE SHOWED HIS SUPERIORS HOW MUCH MONEY THEY COULD SAVE BY IMPLEMENTING THIN
THREAD, HE RECEIVED THE GOVERNMENT'S HIGHEST HONOR.
>> I WAS CHARGED As A SPY.
>> SORRY.
YOU MISSPOKE.
>> I WAS CHARGED UNDER THE ESPIONAGE ACT FOR BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON MASSIVE FRAUD, WASTE
AND ABUSE AND ILLEGALITIES COMMITTED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT.
>> WHOA!
THIS GUY WASN'T SOME PENCIL PUSHING COST BENEFIT ANALYST.
HE WAS A SUPER SPY AT WAR WITH THE BUM ADMINISTRATION.
WE NEEDED TO MEET MORE DISCREETLY.
>> I THINK THIS IS A SAFE PLACE WE CAN TALK.
>> I HOPE SO.
DO YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE A PERMIT?
>> PARDON ME?
>> YOU NEED A PERMIT TO FILM HERE.
>> THE GOVERNMENT HAD US TAILED.
SO WE MET AGAIN FAR FROM THE WATCHFUL EYE OF BIG BROTHER.
>> GUYS, SERIALLY.
I TOLD YOU, YOU CAN'T BE HERE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
>> WHERE THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SHOOT IN THIS STUPID CITY THEN?
ALL RIGHT.
WE WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL.
LIKE ANY GOOD SPY, HE BROUGHT HIS LAWYER TO HELP HIM EXPLAIN WHY HE WASN'T A SPY.
>> THIN THREAD WAS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED WITH JUST A FEW MILLION DOLLARS.
YET THEY SHUT DOWN THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S TOO EFFECTIVEMENT IT SEVERELY EMBARRASSED HIM.
>> WHAT DID YOU DO IN
>> I BROUGHT THIN THREAD TO MY REPORTING OFFICIALS.
>> HE SAID, YOU DON'T WANT TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS,
MR. DRAKE.
LEAVE IT ALONE.
>> HOLY [BLEEPED].
THAT MEETING WOULD MAKE ABAWESOME MOVIE.
>> I WARRANT TO THE FAR ENDS TO FIND THE TRUTH.
>> JASON JONES AS THOMAS DRAKE.
>> I TOOK OFF THE BINNER.
>> IN "THE WHISTLE-BLOWER]
[GUNFIRE]
>> IT'S MY WAY OR THE SKYWAY.
>> THERE WERE NO GUNS.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO GUNS?
THIS IS THE N.S.A.
>> NO GUNS.
>> THIS DOESN'T SOUND VERY SPY-LIKE.
>> WELL, I HAD MY TWO PIECES OF PAPER OUT.
>> SO YOU WENT IN THERE TWO PAPERS ABLAZING.
I'M HERE TO CUT COSTS AND KICK ASS.
LOOKS LIKE I'M ALL OUT OF COSTS.

[LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER]
NO FIGHTING IS ALLOWED ON THE N.S.A. PREMISES.
>> OH, COME ON, THAT WAS BAD AS.
>> LOOK AT THAT.
>> DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET WITH THEM.
>> GOTCHA.
>> I WAS JUST WONDERING IF HE'S AVAILABLE ON ON THE 3rd.
>>ALL RIGHT.
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.
>> IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD SPY STORY.
>> IT'S REAL LIFE.
>> SO WHAT CAME NEXT?
WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?
>> WELL, I WAS NOT GOING TO REMAIN SILENT.
I MADE A FATEFUL DECISION TO CONTACT A REPORTER AT THE "BALTIMORE SUN."
>> HOW DID YOU GET THE SECRET OUT, MICROSCOPIC DOT ON YOUR SHOE?
>>
>> YOUR ESOPHAGUS?
>> USING A SECURE E-MAIL SYSTEM.
>> I USED MY E-MAIL.
>> I SHARED INFORMATION REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF A PROGRAM CALLED THIN THREAD BUT
MASSIVE FRAUD, WASTE AND ABUSE.
>> THIS DESK JOCKEY ALSO REVEALED AN INTERNAL TEST OF THIN THREAD DISCOVERED
INFORMATION IN N.S.A.'S OWN DAY PA BASE THAT MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED 9/11.
AND THAT IS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SENT IN THEIR NINJA.
>> ACTUALLY, THERE ARE NO NINJAS EMPLOYED BY N.S.A.M.
>> WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD THINK THIS GUY IS A [BLEEPED]
SPY?
HE'S TERRIBLE.
>> I WAS AN AMERICAN WHO TOOK AN TOAT DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.
IT'S NOT CRIMINAL TO HAVE CONTACT WITH A REPORTER.
>> BUT ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT, IT IS, SO THEY ARRESTED HIM.
>> HERE I AM FACING THE PROSPECT OF A PUBLIC TRIAL IN WHICH IF I WERE FOUND GUILTY I WOULD
ESSENTIALLY SPEND THE REST OF MY NATURAL LIFE IN PRISON.
>> BUT WHEN THE MEDIA STARTED PUBLICIZING DRAKE'S CASE AND THE
N.S.A.'S INCOMPETENCE BECAME PUBLIC, IT WAS CLEAR THE TEN FELONY COUNTS WERE UTTER BULL
[BLEEPED], BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL MANAGED TO GET HIM TO PLEAD TO THE MOST DAMNING CHARGE
THEY COULD MUSTER.
>> TO EXCEEDING AUTHORIZED USE OF A COMPUTER.
>> IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PLAYING TOO MUCH FACEBOOK ON YOUR WORK COMPUTER.
>> THAT'S NOT A GREAT NAME FAR MOVIE TITLE.
THIS IS NOT A MOVIE.
>> YOU BET YOUR ASS IT'S NOT.
>> DRAKE RUINED EVERYTHING FOR MY MOVIE CAREER.
OH, AND ALSO THE N.S.A.
>> THEY'VE CRIMINALIZE FIRM ACTIVITIES.
THEY'VE CRIMINALIZED THE EXPOSURE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS
OF OUR OWN GOVERNMENT.
>> OR THE PUT THAT IN LEGAL TERMS...
>> IT'S [BLEEPED] UP.
>> NOW THAT IS A MUSH BETTER TITLE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> JASON JONES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
