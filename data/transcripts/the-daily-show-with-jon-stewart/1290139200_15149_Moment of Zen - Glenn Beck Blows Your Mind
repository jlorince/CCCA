BY THE WAY, BEFORE WE GO, I WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW, OUR VERY OWN
AASIF MANDVI IS A FINE
CORRESPONDENT AND A TERRIFIC
ACTOR IN HIS OWN RIGHT.
HE'S IN THE FILM "TODAY'S
SPECIAL."
IF YOU LIKE THINGS THAT ARE MADE
WELL AND EXECUTED WELL, YOU
MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
OR IF YOU LIKE PIECES OF
[BLEEPED], I WOULD STAY HOME
BECAUSE HE'S GOOD AND HE'S GOOD
IN IT.
HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
>> CRIME OF THE CENTURY AND
COVER-UP.
THE COVER-UP WILL BLOW YOUR
MIND.
TOMORROW AN HOUR THAT WILL BLOW
YOUR MIND.
THE NEXT TEN MINUTES WILL BLOW
YOUR MIND.
THE ACTUAL PICTURE OF THE TOWER
