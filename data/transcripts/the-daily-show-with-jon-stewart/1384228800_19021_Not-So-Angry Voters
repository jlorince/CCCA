OF THE PEOPLE IS THE ONLYLEGITIMATE FOUNDATION OF ANY
GOVERNMENT.

WHAT HAPPENS THOSE WHODON'T?
JASON JONES FILES THIS REPORT.
>> AMERICAN POLITICIANS SERVE ATTHE PLEASURE OF THE PEOPLE, AND
JUST ONE WRONG MOVE CAN END YOURCAREER, WHETHER IT BE THIS OR
SOMETHING FAR WORSE.
-- VOTING YOUR CONSCIENCE.
>> I WAS SERVING AS THEPRESIDENT OF THE COLORADO STATE
SENATE.
WE PASSED COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETYLEGISLATION AND I WAS RECALLED
FOR THAT.
>> YOU LIVE IN COLORADO.
WHY WOULD DO YOU THAT?
>> BECAUSE IT WAS THE THE RIGHTTHING TO DO.
>> IN THE WAKE OF A TRAGEDYMORSE FORCED GUN SAFETY
REGULATION ON AN UNWILLINGPOPULOUS AND WAS BOOTED FROM
OFFICE IN A RECALL ELECTION.
POLITICAL STRATEGIST JIM SPENCERTHINKS PASSING THOSE LAWS WAS
( BLEEP ) STUPID.
HOW DANGEROUS IS IT TO VOTEAGAINST POPULAR OPINION?
>> IT'S USUALLY POLITICALSUICIDE.
>> YOU COULD SHOOT YOURSELF INTHE
FOOT TRYING TO PROTECT OTHERPEOPLE FROM GETTING SHOT ALL
OVER.
>> YOU CAN DO THE WRONG THING BYDOING THE RIGHT THING.
>> A NEEDLESS LOSS OF POLITICALLIFE.
IF ONLY MORRIS HAD LISTENED TOTHE PEOPLE.
>> DON'T TAKE AWAY MY GUNS.
AND NOBODY'S TAKING AWAYANYBODY'S GUNS--
>> SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
I HAVE THEM.
DON'T TAKE THEM AWAY.
>> NOBODY WOULD TOUCH YOURSECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, BUT YOU
WOULD NEED A BACKGROUND CHECK TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL BEFORE YOUGET A GUN.
>> OF COURSE.
>> IF YOU WANT CONCEALED WEAPONSPERMIT YOU HAVE TO GET SOME OF
THAT TRAINING IN PERSON, NOTJUST ON THE INTERNET.
>> IT SAYS RIGHT HERE THEMAJORITY OF THE STATE APPROVED
OF EVERY SINGLE LAW MORRISHELPED PASS.

LEVEL-HEADED GUN SAFETYLEGISLATION.

>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> DID YOU?
>> I DID NOT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> YUP.
>> OKAY.
>> 80% OF THE PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOWUP TO VOTE.
IF I COULD HAVEN GOTTEN EVENTHIS MUCH OF THAT 80% TO SHOW UP
THE ELECTION WOULD HAVE TURNEDOUT VERY DIFFERENTLY.
>> WHO WAS THE, 20%?
>> THE NEW LAWS I DON'T THINKSHOULD EXIST AT ALL.
>> 15-ROUND LIMIT.
WHY CAN'T I HAVE 16?
WHO ARE-- WHO ARE THEY TO TELLME I CAN'T HAVE 16.

>> EXACTLY.
>> AND GUESS WHAT?
DID YOU VOTE IN THE RECALLELECTION.
>> YES I DID.
>>TURNS OUT GETTING THE ANTI GUNCONTROL PRO CHIN BRAID CROWD TO
THE POLLS WASN'T HARD AT ALL.
>> I THINK THAT THE N.R.A. ANDGUN GROUPS WERE VERY STRATEGIC.
ALL OUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWNNEGATIVE EMOTIONS MOTIVATE
PEOPLE MORE THAN POSITIVEEMOTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED IN COLORADO.
>> HOW DO YOU MOTIVATEREASONABLE PEOPLE TO COME OUT
AND VOTE?
>> THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE TUNEDIN ARE THE ANGRIEST PEOPLE.
>> SO MAKE THEM ANGRY.
>> YEAH, MAKE THEM ANGRY.
>> IF IMAGINARY TERRIBLE THINGSARE WHAT GET PEOPLE ANGRY ENOUGH
TO VOTE, I KNEW WHAT I HAD TODO.
