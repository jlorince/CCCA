>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE IRANIAN
AMERICAN COUNCIL, HIS NEW
BOOK IS CALLED A SINGLE ROLL
OF THE DICE.
BAMA'S DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN,
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW
TRINA PARSI, SIR.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Stephen: .
>> Jon: SINGLE ROLE OF THE
DICE.
YOU KNOW WHAT IS NICE ABOUT
THIS BOOK,IERS FROM NOW
AFTER THE ENORMOUS WAR WE
HAD WITH IRAN, PEOPLE CAN
LACK BACK ON THIS AND GO OH,
WE ALMOST HAD PEACE WITH
THEM.
IT IS INTERESTING, YOU START
THE BOOK IN 1993.
OR 2003.
>> 2003.
>> THE IRANIANS SEND US A
LETTER AFTER WE HAVE JUST
KNOCKED OUT SADDAM HUSSEIN.
AND WHAT DO THEY SAY TO NEWS
THIS LETTER.
>> THEY SEND A PROPOSAL, AN
UNPRECEDENTED PROPOSAL TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.
ALL THREE ESSENTIALLY
NEGOTIATIONS ON ALMOST ALL
OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT
THE U.S. HAVE DIFFICULTY
WITH.
WHAT HAPPENS, THOUGH, IS
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T
EVEN CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL
AT THE TIME BECAUSE AT THE
TIME, THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT
WHATEVER WE COULD GET OUT OF
NEGOTIATIONS AND DIPLOMACY,
WE COULD GET EVEN MORE BY
SIMPLY REMOVING THE REGIME
AND INVADING IRAN.
BECAUSE THIS IS RIGHT AFTER
IRAQ, AND YOU KNOW THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION WAS ON THE
ROAD AND THEY THOUGHT THAT
THEY COULD JUST GO FORWARD
AND CHANGE THE VISION
EXACTLY AS THEY WISH.
>> WE WERE RIDING HIGH ON
AMERICAN POWER.
WAS THAT IDEA THAT THIS WAS
THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY AND
WE COULDN'T BE STOPPED.
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING
IN THE PROPOSAL THEY SENT,
THEY BASICALLY ADMIT TO ALL
THE PROXY DEALINGS THAT WE
ACCUSE THEM OF.
HEZBOLLAH, ALL THE SORT OF
WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER
ACTIVITIES LIKE MEDDLING IN
OTHER COUNTRIES.
THEY BASICALLY SAY LIKE YEAH,
WE'LL STOP THAT.
>> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING
BECAUSE THEY GO FOR IT AND
THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD
OFFER TO END ALL SUPPORT FOR
ISLAMIC JIHAD AND HAMAS AND
PRES-- USING VIOLENCE
AGAINST ISRAEL OUTSIDE OF
THE GREEN LINE AND TO EP O
UP THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR
FULL TRANSPARENCY.
>> RIGHT.
>> NOW THERE IS AN ARGUE
THAT SAYS THAT WE DON'T KNOW
IF THIS ACTUALLY WOULD
HAPPEN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
WOULD SUCCEEDS OR NOT BUT
THE PROBLEM IS THIS, AND
THIS IS RECURING EVEN UNDER
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY, WE'RE SO
SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT THAT WE
MAY ACTUALLY MISS IT, BY
ESSENTIALLY HAVING A
SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY OF
NEVER BELIEVING THAT IT'S
POSSIBLE.
AND THE IRANIAN,
INCIDENTALLY, DO THE SAME
THING FLECHLT VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT OBAMA.
THEY DID TO THE DARE TO TAKE
A RISK FOR PEACEMAKING,
SIMILAR TO THE RISKS THAT
THEY ARE TAKING FOR THE
STATUS QUO OF THE
CONFRONTATION.
>> Jon: IT'S REALLY HOW YOU
SHOW AN WEAVE IT IN REALLY
WELL ALL THE NARROW
SELF-INTERESTS THAT EACH
COUNTRY IS PLAYING THEIR
HAND WITH.
AND NOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO
BALANCE THOSE.
SO IT BRINGS US UP TO TODAY
AS A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK
ARE STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
THERE IS A NEW GROUNDSWELL
FROM OUR POLITICIANS FOR
REALLY MOVING HARD ACTION ON
IRAN.
THAT THERE IS ANOTHER DEAL
THAT WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR WITH
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
WHAT IS THAT DEAL.
>> I DESCRIBE IN THE BOOK, I
DID A LOT OF INTERVIEWS WITH
ALMOST ALL OF THE DIFFERENT
ACKERS INVOLVED IN THIS,
RANGING FROM THE ISRAELIS TO
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS TO ALSO THE
IRANIAN NEGOTIATIONERS TO
GETS THEIR PERSPECTIVE.
BUT ALSO TURKEY AND BRAZIL.
BECAUSE AT THE LAST MOMENT
IN 2010, MAY OF THAT YEAR,
RIGHT BEFORE THE
ADMINISTRATION ALMOST
MANAGED TO GET SANCTION
SANCTIONS AT THE SECURITY
COUNCIL, TURKEY AND BRAZIL
STEP UP.
THEY MANAGE TO NEGOTIATE
WITH THE IRANIANS TO GET
THEM TO AGREE TO THE DEAL
THAT IS BUILT ON THE
BENCHMARK OF THE PREVIOUS
DEAL THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION HAD PUT IN
FRONT OF THE IRANIANS, THAT
THE IRANIANS HAD REJECTED
SIX MONTHS EARLIER, BUT THEY
MANAGED TO GET A YES FROM
THE IRANIANS.
WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW,
THOUGH, THAT TWO DAYS BEFORE
THE TURKISH AND BRAZILIAN
PRESIDENT WENT TO IRAN,
RUSSIA AND CHINA HAD ALREADY
AGREED TO NEW SANCTIONS.
SO BY THE TIME THE TURKS AND
BRAZILIANS, ECSTATIC, GOING
TO THE U.S. AND SAYING LOOK,
WE MANAGED TO GET THE
IRANIANS TO PUT A YES AND
THEIR SIGNATURES ON THE DEAL,
THE ADMINISTRATION HAD TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN A DIPLOMATIC
BREAKTHROUGH ON THE NUCLEAR
ISSUE OR FOR SANCTIONS IN
THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
AND THEY CHOSE THE
SANCTIONS.
AND HERE WE ARE.
IT DOESN'T.
>> Jon: THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE US.
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S WHAT WE
DID?
WAS IT FULLY EXPLAINED TO
US.
WELL, BACK IT UP, SO THE
DEAL IS THIS, AND IT WAS
2008 OR 2009.
WE OFFERED TO TAKE FROM IRAN
THEIR LEU WHICH IS THE LOWER
ENRICHED URANIUM.
THEY NEED URANIUM FOR
RADIATION TREATMENT FORCE
CANCER PATIENTS.
WE OFFER TO TAKE THAT FUEL
AND GET THEM FUEL PADS THAT
THEY CAN USE FOR --
>> CREATING THE MEDICAL
ISOTOPES.
AND INCIDENTALLY THAT
REACTOR WAS GIVEN TO IRAN
ABOUT 40 OR SO AREAS AGO BY
THE UNITED STATES.
>> Jon: IF YOU ARE LOOKING
TO GIVE A COUNTRY A PRESENT,
REALLY, A NUCLEAR REACTOR,
JUST THE WAY TO GO.
>> SO.
>> Jon: SO WE ARE GOING TO
TAKE IT FROM THE IRANIANS.
GIVE IT TO US.
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO
RUSSIA.
RUSH L -- RUSSIA WILL TURN
INTO THE FUEL PAD, SEND IT
TO FRANCE, FRANCE WILL SEND
IT TIE RAN BECAUSE THE WHOLE
THING IS-- BUT THEY DECIDE
AT THE LAST MINUTE NOT TO DO
THAT DEAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T
LIKE FRANCE, THE IRANIANS
WITHIN THE IRANIANS MESSED
IT UP IN OCTOBER '09.
THEY WENT TO THE
NEGOTIATIONS.
THE FIRST DAY OF THE
NEGOTIATIONS WAS SPENT ON
TRYING TO CUT THE FRENCH OUT
OF THE DEAL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHICH I THINK THERE ARE
SYMPATHIES AMONGST THE OTHER
ISSUES.
>> Jon: NOBODY LIKES THE
FRENCH.
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN.
>> EVEN ENEMIES CAN AGREE,
NOBODY LIKES THE FRENCH.
>> THEY FAILED AT DOING THAT
BUT AT THE END OF IT THEY
HAD AN ISSUE BECAUSE THEY
FELT THAT THE RISK WAS MORE
ON THEIR SHOULDERS.
BUT THE REAL ISSUE WAS THE
IRANIAN
POLITICAL-- POLITICAL A LET
AT THE TIME WAS AT WAR WITH
ITSELF BECAUSE OF THE
FRAUDULENT SECTIONS A FEW
MONTHS YERLER, MASSIVE HUMAN
RIGHT AS BECAUSE,.
IRAN WAS NOT IN A POSITION
TO NEGOTIATE.
THEY MESS TDZ UP.
BUT SIX MONTHS LATER WE HAVE
AN OPENING.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE BRAZIL
TUR KAE ONE.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: AND THAT WAS BASED
ON OH, WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF-- YOU CAN STICK AROUND.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING STICK
AROUND.
IT'S BASED ON THE REMEMBER
THAT OBAMA SENT TO BRAZIL
THIS IS IN THE SOMETHING
THEY DID ON THEIR OWN.
THEY WERE DOING IT AT THE
BEHEST OF THE PRESIDENT AND
THEY PUBLISHED THAT LETTER.
>> YES, PRETTY MUCH SO.
>> Jon: IT'S REALLY GETTING
GOOD NOW.
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO GET
THIS, SINGLE ROLL OF THE
DICE.
ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
REALLY, IT IS AN AMAZING
PERSPECTIVE ON ALL THE
ELEMENTS THAT GO INTO EVEN
THE SMALLEST OF DIPLOMATIC
DEALS.
THANK YOU IS SOME OF FOR
BEING HERE.
WE'LL COME BACK.
