LET'S SEE.
THERE WE GO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JUST A FEW HOURS VOTING WILL
START AT THE BIGGEST ELECTION IN
THIS COUNTRY SINCE TWO YEARS AGO
WITH BOTH SIDES CAMPAIGNING
FURIOUSLY TO GET THEIR BASE TO
THE POLLS.
REPUBLICANS YOU ARE UP.
THEY'VE BEEN DECRYING THE LACK
OF BIPARTISANSHIP IN WASHINGTON
WHICH THEY APPARENTLY WILL DECRY
UNTIL THEY TAKE CONTROL OF IT.
THERE'S NO COMPROMISE ON ENDING
THE ERA OF RUNAWAY SPENDING.
WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON OUR
PRINCIPLES AND WE WILL NOT
COMPROMISE ON THE WILL OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> WE CAN'T AFFORD TO COMPROMISE
ON PRINCIPLE.
>> I READ SOME THE MEDIA
PROMOTING THAT THE MISTAKES OF
THE PAST REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
WERE THAT THEY DIDN'T COMPROMISE
ENOUGH.
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS FAILS
BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH
COMPROMISE.
>> GOOD HEAVENS.
MY STARS AND GARTERS.
THIS TIME WE WON'T EVEN TALK TO
THE DEMOCRATS.
WERE YOU AWARE RICH PEOPLE STILL
PAY TAXES?
A SAY -- THE DEMOCRATS ARE
STRIKING BACK WITH THEIR MOST
POWERFUL WEAPON.
TOTAL DELUSION.
>> I BELIEVE WE'LL HOLD ON TO
BOTH HOUSES.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING
TO HOLD ON TO THE HOUSE.
>> IT'S A DEMOCRATIC TIDAL WAVE.
THERE'S AN UNDERTOE.
>> Jon: IF YOU WANT TO STOP A
RED WAVE, YOU DON'T USE BLUE
THUNDER, YOU USE A BLUE SEA WALL
OR RETAINING AREA.
THUNDER IS ONLY GOOD IF YOU ARE
TRYING TO SCARE DOGS.
HOW BAD HAS IT GOTTEN FOR THE
DEMOCRATS?
THEY DESCENDED FORMER PRESIDENT
CLINTON TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST
OTHER DEMOCRATS.
>> BILL CLINTON TRIED TO
PERSUADE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
KENDRICK MEEK TO DROP OUT OF
RUNNING IN THE THREE-WAY RACE
FOR THE FLORIDA SENATE SEAT.
>> Jon: HISTORIC NOTE:  IT'S
THE FIRST TIME BILL CLINTON HAS
EVER TRIED TO TALK SOMEONE OUT
OF A THREE-WAY.
BOOM!
BOOYA!
[LAUGHTER]
RALLY TO RESTORE WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
LE IS CLINTON -- WHY IS CLINTON
BACK LIFE LONG REPUBLICAN
CHARLIE CRIST OVER THE
DEMOCRATS?
>> CLINTON AND THE TOP AIDES
THOUGHT THEY CONVINCED MEEK TO
DROP OUT THUS DELIVERING
MODERATES TO CHARLIE CRIST AND
PREVENTING MARCO RUBIO FROM
WINNING.
>> Joe: RATHER THAN VOTE FOR
THE GUY WHO WOULD AGREE FOR THEM
ON MOST THINGS THEY'LL SETTLE
FOR THE GUY WHO NEVER REALLY
AGREED ON ANYTHING TO KEEP OUT
THE GUY WHO WON'T TALK TO THEM.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYING TO A
HALF EMPTY ARENA IN ULTRA BLUE
CLEVELAND.
>> THE NUMBER OF EMPTY SEATS
CAUGHT AT TENSION.
>> 8,000 IN AN ARENA THAT HOLDS
13,00.
>> Jon: I WONDER WAS THE
TURNOUT WAS SO BAD IN CLEVELAND.
UNLESS YOU WORE DOCTOR THAT'S
THE MISTAKE.
LE BEFORE ON JERSEY.
HE IS NOT -- LEBRON JERSEY.
SOMEONE SHOULD WARN THAT GUY.
DESPITE THE PRESIDENT STICKING
WITH THE METAPHOR OF REPUBLICANS
WANTING THE KEYS BACK.
>> WE DON'T MIND THE REPUBLICANS
JOINING US.
THEY CAN COMFORT RIDE BUT THEY
HAVE TO SIT IN BACK.
>> Jon: YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
I MEAN THEY CAN SIT IN THE CAR
BUT YOU CAN'T -- YOU KNOW --
PRETTY INNOCUOUS OR WAS IT?
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT STORY THE
FOX WAY?
>> IN THE BACK, NOT EXACTLY THE
TASTEFUL REFERENCE THERE, MR.
PRESIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU THINK THE
PRESIDENT IS SAYING REPUBLICANS
HAVE TO TAKE IT IN THE BUTT?
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S FILTHY.
THAT'S -- OR IS IT SOMETHING
EVEN STUPIDER.
>> PRESIDENT.
BARACK ACTUALLY SAID REPUBLICANS
CAN GOOD TO THE BACK OF THE BUS.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HEARD THE
COMMENT.
>> Jon: NO, NO.
I'M NOT SURE YOU HEARD THE
COMMENT.
HE SAID CAR, NOT BUS.
IF THIS THIS IS A RACIAL METAPHOR YOU
ARE NOT ROSA PARKS, YOU ARE MISS
DAISY.
IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE END HE
FEEDS YOU PIE.
>> WHAT WE'RE REALLY SAYING IS A
REFERENCE TO THE NOTION OF BEING
IN THE BACK OF THE BUS.
>> I KNOW THAT THE ASSOCIATION
THAT THAT WAS BRINGING TO THE
PUBLIC MIND.
>> MAYBE AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS
MOVEMENT OF THE 1960'S RIDING IN
THE BACK HAS CIVIL RIGHTS,
RACIAL OVERTONES TO IT.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT
AWARE OF THAT.
>> THAT THOUGHT FLEW THROUGH MY
MIND AS HE WATCHED IT.
YOU ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE
PEOPLE MENTIONING THAT THAT WAS
THE CONNECTION THEY MADE.
>> Jon: UNLESS YOU CHANGE THE
CHANNEL.
AND THEN YOU ARE HEARING NO ONE
MENTIONING THAT.
OH, MY GOD IT'S A FOX NEWS
EXCLUSIVE.
[LAUGHTER]
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A CAR.
WATCH PETER JON DOING THE
NECESSARY VERBAL GYMNASTICS TO
TURN THIS INTO THE ROSA PARKS
METAPHOR.
>> ONCE THE CAR IS OUT OF DITCH
AND THE REPUBLICANS DEMAND THE
KEYS, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE KEYS
BUT WE'LL LET YOU SIT UNTIL THE
BACK OF THE BUS.
THE AMERICAN CAR IS A BUS AND A
CAR FOR ALL AMERICANS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: PROBLEM SOLVED.
IT'S A BUS-SCAR.
[LAUGHTER]
-- BUS-CAR.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S ALSO A SUBMARINE AND A TIME
MACHINE.
OOOH.
POINT IS OBAMA IS A RACIST.
AT LEAST WEEK ALL AGREE HOW
OFFENSIVE IT WOULD BE FOR ANY
MAJOR POLITICAL FIGURE TO INVOKE
THE UGLY HISTORY OF SEGMENT FOR
AN ELECTION IN 2010 IN THE FALL
UNLESS IT WAS MICHAEL STEELE IN
THE SUMMER OF 20810.
>> WE'RE GOING TO WIN IN
NOVEMBER AND NANCY PELOSI WILL
BE IN THE BACK OF THE BUS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I BET HE WOULD LIKE TO
