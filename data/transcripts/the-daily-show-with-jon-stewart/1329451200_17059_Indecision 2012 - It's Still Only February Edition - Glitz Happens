ALL RIGHT.
ACTUALLY THE WHOLE SECOND
MEANING OF SANTORUM THING
WAS STARTED AS A PROTEST OF
THE SENATOR'S VIEWS ON GAY
MARRIAGE.
BUT LATELY, ACTIVISTS HAVE
TAKEN AN EVEN MORE SUBTLE
APPROACH TO THAT ISSUE.
>> RICK SANTORUM'S TRIP TO
WASHINGTON STATE LAST NIGHT
WASN'T ALL SMOOTH SAILING.
>> IT'S CALLED GLITTER
BOMBING.
>> PROTESTORS CRASHED THE
EVENT AND HE FELL VICTIM TO
ANOTHER GLITTER BOMB.
>> Jon: NO WORD WHETHER THIS
WAS DETONATED REMOTELY OR
THE WORK OF A SUICIDE
GLITTER BOMBER.
(LAUGHTER)
THE GLITTER BOMB HAS EMERGED
AS A WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR
GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS LOOKING
FOR A FORM OF PROTEST THAT'S
MORE CLEVER THAN A PIE IN
THE FACE, BUT LESS CLEVER
THAN SOMETHING ACTUALLY
CLEVER.
(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT
ONE COMING, DID YOU?
ALMOST ALL THE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN HIT.
INCLUDING MITT ROMNEY, NEWT
GINGRICH AND MICHELEBACK
MANN, BLIRT-- GLITTER
BOMBING IS SUCH A CONCERN
THE SECRET SERVICE USED
SPECIALLY TRAINED GLITTER
BOMB SNIFFING DOGS.
(LAUGHTER)
IF NOTHING ELSE THESE
INCIDENTS GIVE VOTERS A
CHANCE TO SEE HOW CANDIDATES
HANDLE THEMSELVES UNDER
FIRE.
MAY FAVORITE RESPONSE HAS TO
BE MITT ROMNEY'S.
>> OH, I'VE GOT GLITTER IN
MY HAIR.
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT IS IN MY
HAIR, I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE,
ANYBODY SEEN SOMETHING ABOUT
MARY?
SERIOUSLY, THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF STUFF IN MY HAIR.
ANYWAY.
STILL, I DO HAVE TO HAND IT
TO THE GAY ACTIVISTS WHO
CARRY OUT THESE GLITTER
BOMBINGS.
REALLY TERRIFIC WAY TO WIN
PEOPLE TO YOUR SIDE.
IT'S A CLEAR UNEQUIVOCAL
STATEMENT.
WE ARE DESERVING OF DIGNITY,
RESPECT, AND EQUAL RIGHTS.
AND UNTIL WE GET IT, WE WILL
ACT LIKE PET LENT
