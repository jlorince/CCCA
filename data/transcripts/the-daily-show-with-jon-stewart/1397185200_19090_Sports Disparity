TURNING TO THE WORLD OF SPORT --BAD SEGUE.
THIS WEEK SAW MARCH MADNESS DRAWTO A CLOSE WITH CHAMPIONSHIP
WINS FOR BOTH THE UNIVERSITY OFCONNECTICUT MEN'S AND WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL TEAMS.
WOOF -- THEY ARE THE HUSKIES.
LET'S GO RIGHT OUT TO HEAR FROMTHE MOST OUTSTANDING PLAYER OF
FINAL FOUR, SHABAZZ NAPIER.
>> WE DO HAVE HUNGRY NIGHTS THATWE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO
GET FOOD. THERE ARE HUNGRYNIGHTS WHERE I'M NOT ABLE TO EAT
AND I STILL HAVE TO PLAY UP TOMY CAPABILITIES.
THERE ARE HUNGRY NIGHTS THAT IGO TO BED AND I'M STARVING.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY, I DON'TUNDERSTAND SURELY YOUR WEALTHY
PARENTS AND OR LOCAL BASKETBALLPATRONS CAN SEND YOU A
LOT OF MONEY SO YOUCAN ORDER FOOD.
HOW COULD A GUY PLAYING ON THEBIGGEST STAGE IN COLLEGE SPORTS
BE GOING HUNGRY.
>> IF YOU COME FROM A LOW INCOMEURBAN ENVIRONMENT THERE'S NO MOM
SEND ME A MEAL CARD.
SEND ME MONEY.
I RAN OUT OF CASH.
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FALL BACKON THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THESE
GUYS END UP GOING TO BED HUNGRY.
>> Jon: SOME OF THE PLAYERSINTEGRAL TO THE NCAA TOURNAMENT
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO EAT.
BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE PRICE YOUPAY TO BE INVOLVED IN A
STRUGGLING START-UP CHARITYTOURNAMENT LIKE MARCH MADNESS.
>> THE NCAA SIGNING THISLANDMARK 14 YEAR DEAL WITH
TURNER BROADCASTING AND CBSSPORTS. GET THIS.
$10.8 BILLION AGREEMENT.
>> ESTIMATES SUGGEST THE COLLEGESPORTS INDUSTRY GENERATES ON
AVERAGE $11 BILLION IN REVENUEANNUALLY.
>> Jon: OKAY, BUT WAIT, THATIS PRETAX.
[ LAUGHTER ]THAT IS PRETAX.
THAT IS GROSS.
[ LAUGHTER ]IT'S GROSS.
IT'S -- IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOWWHAT, WAIT A MINUTE, I FORGOT,
ACTUALLY IT'S $11 BILLIONBECAUSE ANYWAY THEY ARE A
NONPROFIT. THE NCAAIS A NONPROFIT.
SO $11 BILLION IN I GUESSNOTHING BUT NET WOULD BE THE
PHRASE.
[LAUGHTER]IT SOUNDS LIKE GOING UP AGAINST
A NONPROFIT MONOPOLY LIKE THENCAA WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT
FOR ATHLETES TO IMPROVE THEIRCONDITIONS.
IN A GAME CHANGING DECISION ANATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
FOUND FOOTBALL PLAYERS ATNORTHWESTERN NOW QUALIFY AS
UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANSTHEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE.
>> Jon: UNIONS?
[LAUGHTER]SINCE WHEN DO UNIONS BELONG IN
COLLEGE SPORTS?
THEY ARE SOCIALIST AND COMMUNISTCOLLECTIVES.
SPORTS ARE ABOUT PEOPLE COMINGTOGETHER AS A GROUP WORKING
TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL FROM EACHACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY,
PUTTING THE TEAM AHEAD OF THE --OH, MY GOD!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
I KNEW THAT PICTURE OF STALINLOOKED FAMILIAR.
HOW DID THE NCAA REACT TO THISDECISION?
>> THE NCAA SAYS IT'SDISAPPOINTED WITH THE RULING
ADDING STUDENTS PLAY FOR THELOVE OF SPORT NOT FOR A SALARY.
>> Jon: YES, THE LOVE OF SPORTMUCH LIKE THE NCAA BROADCASTS
MARCH MADNESS FOR THE LOVE OFTHE SPORT.
NOT FOR A $10.8 BILLION CONTRACTWHICH THEY ALSO LOVE.
