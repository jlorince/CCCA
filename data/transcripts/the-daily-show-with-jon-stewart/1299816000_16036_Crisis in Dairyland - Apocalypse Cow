( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
TIME TO CHECK IN ONCE AGAIN ON
THE FAST-CHANGING SITUATION IN
WISCONSIN.
THREE WEEKS INTO A SEEMINGLY
ENDLESS STANDOFF BETWEEN
WISCONSIN GOVERNOR WALKER AND
STATE DEMOCRATIC SNEEFRTZ A NEW
LAW THAT WOULD STRIP TEACHERS
AND STATE WORKERS OF MOST OF
THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
RIGHTS, THE STANDOFF CAME ON 2
AN ABRUPT END.
DID THE AWOL SENATORS RETURN
HANDING THE GOVERNOR A VICTORY
AND QUORUM?
DID THE GOVERNOR CAVE AND
PROMISE TO REMOVE THE
RESTRICTIONS ON COLLECTIVE PRG
IN EXCHANGE FOR FINANCIAL
CONCESSIONS.
>> Reporter: THE REPUBLICANS
USED A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWED
THEM TO VOTE WITHOUT THE
DEMOCRATS.
>> Jon: THAT'S A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING.
IT'S LIKE SPENDING THREE WEEKS
PUSHING AGAINST THE DOOR UNTIL
FINALLY SOMEONE GOES, "DID YOU
TRY PULLING IT?"
( LAUGHTER )
NOT THAT THE DEMS WENT DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT-- OR SHOULD I
SAY THE DEM?
>> AND THAT IS WRONG.
NOW, I-- MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS IS A
VIOLATION OF LAW.
THIS IS NOT JUST A RULE.
IT'S A LAW.
>> ADJOURNED.
>> NO, MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS IS A
VIOLATION OF THE OPEN MEETINGS
LAW.
IT REQUIRES 24-- AT LEAST TWO
HOURS' NOTICE.
>> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE?
>> EXCUSE ME.
>> Jon: MR. CHAIRMAN!
( LAUGHTER )
WHERE IS EVERYBODY GOING?
I'M STILL HOLDING PAPERS.

IMPRESSIVE HOW POLITE
WISCONSINITES REMAIN IN FACE OF
EXPLOSIVE SITUATION.
SERIOUSLY, THEY FUMBLE YOUR
ORDER IN A NEW YORK CITY
STARBUCKS AND WATCH HOW QUICKLY
( BLEEP ) HITS THE FAN THERE.
MEANWHILE, THE REAL VILLAINS IN
THIS ENTIRE SITUATION THE

CAVALIERLY DRAINED WISCONSIN AND
