GREEN -- THAT CAUGHT EVERYONE
OFF GUARD.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN CHICAGO, THE
CITY OF BROAD SHOULDERS, THE
BRAWLING HOME OF GANGSTERS,
TOUGH GUYS AND FOOD THAT WOULD
KILL I MAN JUST AS SOON AS LOOK
AT HIM.
SEE THAT SANDWICH?
WE'VE GOT A NAME FOR THAT
SANDWICH IN CHICAGO, IT'S CALLED
THE LITTLE BALLERINA SANDWICH.
THEY LIKE TO EAT.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR DECADES IT WAS RULED BY THE
IRON FIST OF MAYOR J.DALEY
FOLLOWED BY HIS SON.
THIS YEAR THE SEAT IS OPEN AND
ONE CANDIDATE SEEMS UNIQUELY
CALLIFIED TO PULL THE TOMMY GUNN
FROM THE STONE AND CLAIM HIS
PLACE.
>> RAHM EMANUEL IS KNOWNÑi FOR A
TOUGH STYLE.
>> KNOWN FOR HIS TAKE NO
PRISONERS STYLE.
>> NOT AFRAID TO DROP F-BOMBS
ALONG THE WAY.
>> I GUESS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
IS HE IS KIND OF A PRICK.
I THAT'S THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE
SAYING.
EVEN HIS COMPLAIN SLOGAN SEEMS
RIGHT FOR THE CITY AND THE TIME.
CHANGE YOU (bleep) CAN BELIEVE
IN.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHY HAVE THE ELECTION.
LET'S CALL HIM MR. MAYOR.
>> STUNNING DEVELOPMENT RAHM
EMANUEL HAS BEEN THROWN OFF THE
BATTLE.
>> THEY FOUND THE TRAIL OF
MUTILATED HENCHMEN LEFT IN THE
WAKE OF HIS LUST FOR POWER,
HUMAN PARTS EMBEDDED IN THE
FOUNDATION OF CHICAGO'S TALLEST
BUILDING.
MAYBE CONFUSING THIS WITH A
BATMAN EPISODE I SAW OR RAHM'S
BROTHER ARI.
BOOM!
I BET THEY GOT SOMETHING BAD ON
HIM.
>> THE ISSUE IS WHETHER HE MEETS
THE STATE LAW REQUIREMENT THAT
ANY CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR BE A
RESIDENT FOR A YEAR BEFORE THE
ELECTION.
>> Jon: THE CHICAGOAN.
NO, THAT'S NOT THE CHICAGO WAY.
IT'S NOT THEY BRING YOU AYOU
KNIFE YOU BRING A GUN NOT YOU
BRING A BRIEF BASED ON THE COOK
COUNTY CODE.
RAHM HAS ALWAYS LIVED IN CHICAGO
BUT HE WENT TO WORK AS THE
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF.
WHILE HE WAS THERE IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. HE RENTED OUT
HIS HOUSE TO PEOPLE WHO DECIDED
THAT WHEN RAHM WANTED TO COME
BACK TO RUN FOR MAYOR THEY
WOULDN'T LET HIM HAVE THE HOUSE
BACK.
BY THE WAY --
>> THE CHICAGO WAY.
>> Jon: YEAH.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T
HAVE EVIDENCE OF HIS CONTINUED
INTENT TO RESIDE IN CHICAGO.
ONE WAY HE COULD PROVE IT IS
THAT HE LEFT HIS WIFE'S WE HAD
BEGUN DRESS AT THEIR -- WEDDING
DRESS AT THEIR HOUSE.
>> THERE'S ALSO A COAT THAT MY
GRANDFATHER ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE
WHO CAME TO CHICAGO IN 1917 FROM
THE RUSSIAN ROMANIAN BORDER.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HAY, HAY, BUD -- HEY,
HEY, BUDDY I ONCE FORGOT MY
BOOKBAG IN THE OLIVE GARDEN.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME THE MAYOR
OF ITALY.
I'M BEING TOLD ITALY DOESN'T
HAVE A MAYOR AND I DON'T HAVE A
BOOKBAG.
[LAUGHTER]
UNLIMITED PASTA, SALAD AND PAIR
GORGONZOLA RAV DEVELOPY.
YOU CAN EAT FOR $68 CENTS.
GET THE (bleep) OUT OF HERE.
THAT IS FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.
[LAUGHTER]
I WONDER HOW RAHM TOOK THE NEWS.
>> ANYTHING IN THE NEWS YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WOW.
THE ONLY THING SCARIER THAN RAHM
EMANUEL ANGRY IS RAHM EMANUEL
SMILING THROUGH HIS ANGER.
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE
HOW IT TOOK THE NEWS IN THE
PRIVACY OF HIS OWN HOME.
[LAUGHTER]
PUT A SHIRT ON!
FOR MORE ON THE COURT RULING AND
HIS MAYORAL BID WE GO TO JOHN
OLIVER LIVE IN CHICAGO.
JOHN, THANKS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:  ARE
THESE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS TO
BYZANTINE AND STRICT?
>> NOT AT ALL, JON.
THIS IS CHICAGO.
POLITICIANS ARE STICKLERS,
PARAGONS OF VIRTUE DEMANDING
STRICT ADHERENCE TO A CODE OF
CONDUCT.
>> Jon: I THINK THINK CHICAGO
AND ILLINOIS POLITICS IN GENERAL
IS CONSIDERED THE DIRTIEST IN
THE NATION.
>> WHOA WHOA, I'LL HAVE YOU
KNOW, SIR, THAT LESS THAN 60% OF
THEIR LAST SEVEN GOVERNORS HAVE
BEEN CONVICTED OF FELONY.
LESS THAN 60%, JON!
>> Jon: THAT'S ACTUALLY FOUR
OF THE LAST SEVEN THAT'S MORE
THAN HALF.
>> THAT'S BASICALLYt( WHAT I JUST
SAID UNDER 60%.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ROD BLAGOJEVICH, SOME
PEOPLE THINK JOHN F. KENNEDY
ONLY ONE ILLINOIS AND THE
PRESIDENCY IN 1960 BECAUSE OF
VOTES CAST BY PEOPLE IN CHICAGO
WHO WERE DECEASED.
>> HERE WE GO, JON, DEAD
CHICAGOANS FRAUDLY ELECTED
KENNEDY.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHAT ABOUT
THE ALL THE FRAUD CHICAGOANS WHO
HELPED LYNDON JOHNSON PASS THE
CIVIL RIGHTS OF ACT OF 1964.
>> Jon: WHAT HAPPENED TOÑi YOUR
COAT?
>> WHAT.
>> Jon: I THINK SOMEONE STOLE
YOUR COAT.
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, JON,
I'M SURE THEY'LL BRING IT BACK.
EVERYONE HERES WORKS ON AN
HORROR CODE.
>> Jon: I ADMIRE YOUR FAITH IN
THE GOODNESS OF PEOPLE BUT
CHICAGO MAY NOT BE THE PLACE TO
BE EXERCISING THAT FAITH IN
PEOPLE.
>> OKAY.
I DISAGREE, JON.
THAT IS SAY SIMPLIFICATION OF
A --
>> Jon: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
SHIRT?
>> YEAH, JON U I GOT -- I GOT
ATTACKED.
I'M NOW ESSENTIALLY THE PROPERTY
OF THE INSANE SPANISH COBRAS.
NORTH SIDE, JON!
NORTH SIDE!
>> Jon: COME HOME.
>> I LOVE IT HERE.
THE PEOPLE ARE SO WARM EVEN
THOUGH THE CITY HERE IS SO VERY,
VERY COLD!
