E.P.A. OFFICIAL THERE IS AND ONEOF ITS TOP EXPERTS IN CLIMATE

I'M LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OFTHIS STORY.
HOOK ME.
>> HE TOLD HIS BOSSES THAT HEWAS WORKING UNDERCOVER FOR THE
C.I.A., SPENDING A LOT OF TIMEIN PAKISTAN DEALING WITH THE
TALIBAN.
IN FACT, INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOWDISCOVERED HE WAS ACTUALLY AT
HOME IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA RIDINGBICYCLES, READING BOOKS.

WONDERFUL ABOUT THIS STORY: THISMAN IS A LIAR AND BORING AS

>> EXACTLY!
[AUDIENCE BOOS]>> Jon:, NO I SCOFF AT YOUR
BOOS AND, IN FACT, SAY YAY.
HE DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO ALL THATTROUBLE.
HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN AHANDICAPPED PARKING SPACE FOR A
LEGITIMATE MEDICAL REASON -- HISGIGANTIC BALLS.

JUST DRIVE UP ON THE SIDEWALK.
