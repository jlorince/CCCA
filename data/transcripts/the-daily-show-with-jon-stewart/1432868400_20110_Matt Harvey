>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!

THE GAME TODAY. HE'S THE FACE OFNEW YORK METROPOLITANS.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMMATT HARVEY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE! LOOK ATTHAT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> SO THAT'S WHAT, 17 SEASONS,HUH?
>> Jon: THIS IS PERFECT.
IT'S EXACTLY MY SIZE IN THAT ITCAN FUNCTION AS A SHIRT AND
PANTS FOR ME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I AM THRILLED TO HAVE YOU ON THEPROGRAM.
>> THAT'S FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: OH JESUS, COME ON. WHATARE YOU DOING?
JUST GET IT ON THERE, PLEASE.
PERFECT.
(LAUGHTER)
JUST --
(LAUGHTER)
IF IT GETS THIRSTY, JUST GIVEIT A LITTLE WATER.
>> PERFECT.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE TO PROTECTTHE MONEY MAKER, MY FRIEND.
THERE YOU GO.
NICELY DONE.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, HOWOLD ARE YOU?
>> 26.
>> Jon: YOU'RE 26 YEARS OLD.
YOU'VE GOT NEW YORK CITY --
WE'VE NOT SEEN A PLAYER OF YOURABILITY IN MANY YEARS.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE DOC GOODEN,DARYL STRAWBERRY, BACK IN THE
MID '80s, THE LAST TIME WEEXPERIENCED I GUESS WHAT SOME
PEOPLE WOULD CALL -- IT'S BEENSO LONG -- SUCCESS!
(LAUGHTER)
DOES IT FEEL LIKEA RESPONSIBILITY?
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?
ALL EXCITEMENT?
ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF?
>> I THINK IT'S EXCITEMENT. ITHINK FOR US AND THE WHOLE
STAFF, I THINK WE'RE EXCITEDABOUT THE FUTURE. WE'RE EXCITED
ABOUT NOW AND I THINK THE MOSTIMPORTANT THING IS TO FOCUS ON
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AND, YOUKNOW, WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO NEXT
YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER.
WE'RE TRYING TO WIN THAT.
>> Jon: YOU'RE IN THE MOMENT.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HURT BEFORE.
IS IT STRANGE -- DO YOU FEEL THEPESSIMISM OF THE MET FAN?
WE ARE A BEATEN CREATURE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK I SAW AN ARTICLETODAY HOW I SHOULD BE PITCHED
TILL I'M ABUSED ALMOST, SO ITHINK --
>> Jon: WHY, BECAUSE THEYTHINK YOU WILL LEAVE?
>> YES.
>> Jon: BECAUSE YOU'RE WITHTHE METS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU THINK -- ITIS THE METS.
HERE'S MY THOUGHT -- YOUDOMINATE THE LEAGUE FOR TWO
YEARS AND THEY TRADE YOU FOR AMILKING GOAT AND MAGIC BEANS.
BECAUSE THAT IS GENERALLY THEWAY THEY HANDLE EXCELLENT BALL
PLAYERS.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY THIS --THE TEAM IS, WHAT, 27-21?
IF YOU TOLD THEM THE NEW YORKMETS WERE GOING TO BE 27  AND 21
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASONAT THIS POINT, I THINK  ANYONE
WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT.
BUT THE WAY THE YOUNG ARMS HAVEPITCHED, IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE
IT CULD BE MORE, IT COULD BEBETTER.
HOW'S IT FEELING IN THECLUBHOUSE?
>> I THINK WE DEFINITELY FEEL WESHOULD HAVE WON A FEW GAMES WE
DIDN'T, BUT YOU KNOW, WE'RECLOSE.
I THINK THE NATIONALS OBVIOUSLYHAD A SLOW START AND --
>> Jon: OH, THEY'VE BEENPLAYING. THEY GOT SOME BANGERS.
IS IT FRUSTRATING FOR APITCHER--
YOU THROW EIGHT SHUT-OUT INNINGSAND THE OFFENSE MAYBE GETS YOU A
RUN, OR THEY DON'T GET YOU ARUN.
DOES THAT FEEL FRUSTRATING TOPUT IN THAT TYPE OF PERFORMANCE
BUT THE HITTING LAGS BEHIND?
IS THERE A SPLIT BETWEEN OFFENSEAND PITCHING IN THE CLUBHOUSE,
OR DO YOU GUYS JUST TRY TO PICKEACH OTHER UP AND EVERYBODY HAS
PATIENCE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE?
>> I THINK IT'S PATIENCE.
I COULD SAY MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO,I THINK I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
UPSET IN THE MOMENT --
>> Jon: YOU WERE 24.
NOW YOU'RE 26
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: JUST KEEP IT,  WILLYOU PLEASE -- YOU DON'T KNOW.
THIS LUCITE COULD VER MUCHDAMAGE THE ELBOW.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPENTO YOU.
YOU'RE MY FUTURE.
I'M LEAVING THE SHOW.
YOU'RE ALL I HAVE LEFT.
>> I KNOW, WHEN WE WERE TALKING,I WAS, LIKE, WE HAVE TO GET YOU
OUT AND GET SOME .B.P. ORSOMETHING.
>> Jon: ME?>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT WOULD NOT BE ADREAM COME TRUE.
IS IT COMPETITIVE WITH THE OTHERYOUNG PITCHERS?
YOU HAVE CINDERGUARD OUT THERE,22, THROWS SHUT-OUT BALL AND
HITS A HOME RUN.
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I THINK MY FACE -- I SAW IT ONTIWTTER A BUNCH OF TIMES.
I THINK THE FACE I HAD AFTERTHE HOME RUN WAS JUST SHOCK.
>> Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
YOU, DEGROM, DARNO, THIS IS AREALLY YOUNG CORE.
DO YOU FEEL YOU CAN CHANGE THECULTURE OF A TEAM?
IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE TO PUTON--
YOU HAVE THE YANKEES ACROSS TOWNAND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS.
DO YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT THAT, ORREALLY IS IT JUST ABOUT, OR
IS IT LET'S GO OUT AND HAVE FUNAND REMEMBER WHY WE LOVE
THIS GAME?
>> I THINK OUR MINDSET AND HASBEEN FOR, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THIS
YEAR, ESPECIALLY I THINK COMINGINTO SPRING TRAINING, WE HAD ONE
GOAL AND THAT WAS TO WIN.
AND I THINK WE ALL BELIEVEDTHAT.
I THINK IT WAS A LOT DIFFERENTTHAN IN YEARS' PAST, SPRING
TRAINING.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE CARRIED THAT TOALMOST EVERY GAME.
SO I THINK FOR US BEING A YOUNGSTAFF, I THINK WE, YOU KNOW, TRY
TO BRING A LOT OF ENERGY TO THECLUBHOUSE.
>> Jon: I'M SO EXCITED -- I'MGOING TO BRING MY FAMILY DOWN.
WE LOVE GOING TO THE GAMES, WELOVE WATCHING THE TEAM.
YOU HAVE GIVEN US A REASON TO BEHOPEFUL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A
LONG TIME, AND I REALLY DOAPPRECIATE IT.
YOU'RE A BEAST OUT THERE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOUPITCH MORE. THANKS FOR COMING
ON.
>> THANK YOU.
