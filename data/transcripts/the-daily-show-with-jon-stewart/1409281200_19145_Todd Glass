YOU WERE ALWAYS ONE OF THE TOPCOMICS, FUNNY AS HELL, WHAT I

MOST COMEDIANS ARE HIDING HOWMUCH THEY DRINK.

CONFLICT. THAT'S ALLI WANT TO KNOW.
>> YEAH WELL, ABOUT TWO YEARSAGO I... A LOT OF MY COMEDIAN
FRIENDS KNEW THAT I WAS SORT OFIN THE CLOSET, WHICH IS A TERM
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT.
I HAVE AFFECTIONATELY SAID THATI WOULD RATHER IT BE SOMETHING
TOUGHER LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAYBEBUSTING OUT OF THE SHED OR
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.>> Jon: THERE YOU GO.
>> YEAH. STILL GOT A LITTLEOF...
>> Jon: BOOM, YEAH.
>> I'M STILL A GUY, RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT SOUND SOFEMININE. SO, SO YEAH ABOUT
TWO YEARS AGO, AND YOU KNOW, IWAS, BEFORE THE SHOW WE WERE
SAYING THAT IT'S FUNNY BECAUSEAS I'M PROMOTING THE BOOK, I'M
TALKING ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, BUTBEFORE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME
OUT BECAUSE I WAS REALLY AFRAIDIT WOULD BECOME MY IDENTITY.
YOU KNOW. AND I DIDN'T WANT TOSAY BECOME MY IDENTITY,
WHICH IT HASN'T.
>> Jon: SO YOU WERE, YOU KNOW,SO NATURAL ON STAGE, SO
CHARISMATIC, SO FUNNY, BUT ICAN'T IMAGINE AS A PERFORMER,
NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS LIKETHE WHOLE OF YOURSELF ON STAGE.
WAS THAT EXHAUSTING AS APERFORMER, AS SOMEONE WHO EVEN
WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THECONFUSION YOU FACED ABOUT IT OR
NOT WANTING THAT TO BE YOURIDENTITY.
WAS THAT THE MOST DIFFICULTPART?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WASBECAUSE I COULD NEVER TALK
ABOUT IT. I MEAN, I COULDN'TEVEN... LIKE
IF I GOT IN AN ARGUMENTWITH SOMEONE I WAS DATING,
WHICH WAS CHRIS, WHOIS HERE TONIGHT, AND HE'S SO
NERVOUS, HE SAYS, DON'T TALKABOUT MY NAME ON THE SHOW, MY
FRIENDS IN FLORIDA WILL FINDOUT.
>> Jon: WELL, HOW MANY CHRISESCAN THERE BE IN FLORIDA?
>> RIGHT, RIGHT. THERE'S ONE.
IT'S HIM, EVERYBODY.
[LAUGHTER]SO, I KNOW HE HATES THAT.
BUT, YEAH, BECAUSE ON STAGE,LIKE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD TELL
STORIES ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND.
I HAD MORE STORIES ABOUT MYGIRLFRIEND FROM A GUY THAN GUYS
THAT HAD GIRLFRIENDS, BUTTHEY WERE TRUE STORIES.
I JUST SWITCHED THE SEX.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> WHICH PROVES HOW THERELATIONSHIPS ARE THE SAME.
>> Jon: IT'S UNIVERSAL.
>> BECAUSE NEVER ONCE DID I TELLA STORY WHICH WAS ABOUT A GUY
BUT SAYING IT WAS A GIRL AND THE
AUDIENCE WENT, THAT'S WEIRD. YOUKNOW.
WE WOULD ALWAYS JOKE THAT THEONLY TIME I WOULD GET CAUGHT IN
THAT IS ON A SPECIFIC SITUATIONLIKE IF I SAID, YOU KNOW, I'M AT
THE AIRPORT AND I HADTHE USE THE BATHROOM AND
I WAS TALKING TO MY GIRLFRIENDWHO WAS PEEING NEXT TO ME.
WAIT A SECOND.
>> Jon: YEAH, I COULD SEE THATBEING PROBLEMATIC.
>> YEAH, THEN I WOULD GETCAUGHT.
>> Jon: DID YOU, YOU KNOW, IKNOW THAT YOU, SO YOU'VE GOT
THIS LIVING SITUATION. YOU'RELIVING WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND
CHRIS, AND THEN A WOMAN.
>> I LIKE TO SAY, WHAT I LIKETHE SAY IS PARTNER IN CRIME.
>> PARTNER IN CRIME.
>> AND OUR CRIME IS WE DISOBEY AFAKE GOD.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT WORKS OUT.THAT'S FINE.
>> HUH?
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: DO YOU FEEL... WHAT ISTHE FEELING?
WHAT IS... IS THERE A SENSE OFUNBURDENING?
IS THERE A SENSE OF... WHAT ISIT YOU'RE FEELING?
ARE YOU STILL CONFLICTED?ARE YOU NOT CONFLICTED?
>> NO, NO, IT'S...>> DO YOU FEEL FREE?
WHAT'S THE FEELING?
>> IT'S, IT'S, YOU KNOW WHAT, IWAS HAPPY BEFORE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I REALLYWAS, YOU KNOW,
BUT, JON, IT'S SO MUCH BETTER.
IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY I'LL BETALKING ABOUT SOMETHING, EVEN
CASUALLY TO A FRIEND, AND I HAVEA PODCAST.
SOME OF THE KIDS THAT WORK ON ITARE LIKE 20, 21 YEARS OLD.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT IT, NOT EVEN IN DEPTHCONVERSATIONS, YOU KNOW,
JUST HONEST CONVERSATIONS,YOU KNOW.
AND IT'S SO MUCH BETTER.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IT REALLY IS A BETTER WAY.THE PLATE'S SPINNING.
I THINK WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE,EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE,
DON'T REALIZE THE PLATE SPINNINGTHAT GOES ON WITH HIDING IT.
LIKE WHEN WE WOULD HAVE DINNERPARTIES, I TRIED TO TOUGHEN IT
UP, TAKE OUT THE PARTY PART, ITSOUNDS GAY.
DINNERS. WE HAD DINNERS!
WE ATE STEAK.

LIKE IF YOU'RE HAVING A BIGDINNER.
>> Jon: YEAH. MAKE IT LOOK NICE.
>> I LIKE THE LOOK OFIT. I LIKE TO DO IT. YOU KNOW,
NO SODA CANS. BUT, I WOULD BE SOMORTIFIED THAT MY FRIENDS WOULD
FIGURE ME OUT, THAT WE HAD AFRIEND ANDREA AND
I WOULD SAY, BEFORE EVERYONECAME OVER, IT WAS LIKE I WAS
INTERROGATING HER. I WOULD GO,ANDREA, NOW PEOPLE ASK,
WHO SET THE TABLE,WHAT DO YOU SAY?
