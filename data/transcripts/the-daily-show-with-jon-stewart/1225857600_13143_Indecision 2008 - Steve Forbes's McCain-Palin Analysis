( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WE ARE BACK TO THE,
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM.
WE ARE JOINED BY THE EDITOR IN
CHIEF OF FORBES MAGAZINES, STEVE
FORBES, CEO OF FORBES MAGAZINE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WE ARE GOING TO BE WITH
YOU IN A MOMENT.
WOULD YOU CARE?
WE ARE GOING TO DO SOME QUICK
RESULTS HERE.
GEORGIA HAS COME IN AND BEEN
CALLED...
>> YES.
WITH 10% REPORTING, GEORGIA IS
NOW GOING FOR JOHN McCAIN!
JOHN McCAIN.
THIS WAS A HARD-FOUGHT RACE,
JON.
THE LAST TIME SOMEONE SAW A
DOGFIGHT THIS HARD... IT WAS IN
MICHAEL VICK'S BASEMENT.
BY THE WAY, THE CROWD IS
REALLY GOING FOR THE ANIMAL
ABUSE JOKES TONIGHT.
REALLY LOVING THEM.
>> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE
PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.
>> Jon: YOU REALLY HAVE TO.
NOW, IOWA IS A BUSH STATE,
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT WOULD GO
IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE-- AND
PRETEND YOU ARE NOT WATCHING NBC
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
>> WELL, IT WENT FOR GORE IN
2000.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> SO NO SURPRISE IT WILL GO
DEMOCRAT THIS TIME.
>> Jon: WELL, SIR YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
IOWA HAS GONE FOR BARACK
OBAMA.
( APPLAUSE )
I AM SURPRISED IT WENT THAT WAY.
>> Stephen: ME, TOO.
I MEAN...
>> Jon: JUST FOR THE PEOPLE THAT
ARE ENTHRALLED BY WATCHING CORN
GROW, YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD
HAVE GONE FOR McCAIN.
( APPLAUSE )
I AM ALSO GOING TO GO WITH
VERMONT.
STEPHEN, YOU HAVE BEEN TO
VERMONT.
>> Stephen: I HAVE, JON.
VERMONT, VERMONT IS GOING FOR
BARACK OBAMA, JON.
( APPLAUSE )
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SAY THAT'S THE FINAL STRAW--
WE CUT THAT STATE LOOSE.
WE DO NOT NEED THEM.
WE CAN GET OUR CHEDDAR FROM
VERMONT AND I CAN PUNCH A HIPPY
AT WHOLE FOODS, LET THEM GO.
>> Jon: WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO
GET YOUR SYRUP, THOUGH?
>> Stephen: MY SYRUP?
I USE HONEY, SIR.
>> Jon: IS THAT REALLY TRUE?
>> Stephen: YES, I DO.
>> Jon: SO YOU STILL HAVE THAT
BEE FARM?
>> Stephen: UH-HUH.
>> Jon: THAT'S NICE.
WHY DON'T YOU DO THE NEXT
ONE?
>> Stephen: OKAY.
RHODE ISLAND, THIS WAS A
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO
THEY...
OH, NO.
REALLY?
>> Jon: THAT IS THE ENTIRE
POPULATION THERE TONIGHT.
>> Stephen: WHOA!
( APPLAUSE )
GOES FOR BARACK OBAMA.
THE RHINO AND THE GOLDEN
HELMET FOR BARACK OBAMA DON'T
MEAN ANYTHING, BUT I PERSONALLY
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RHODE
ISLAND, SO THAT'S THE BEST WE
COULD DO ON THAT.
I THINK I STEPPED ON THAT BAD
BOY.
>> NOT AT ALL.
>> Jon: TELL ME ABOUT THIS.
ARE YOU CONFUSED ABOUT TONIGHT?
DID YOU THINK IT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN?
YOU WERE AN ADVISOR TO
SENATOR McCAIN ON ECONOMIC
ISSUES.
HE SEEMED TO BE A REALLY QUICK
STUDY ON THAT.
WHAT... WHAT WENT WRONG FOR THIS
GUY?
>> Stephen: YOU SOUND LIKE MY
TEACHERS IN GRADE SCHOOL.
>> THE CREDIT CRISIS DID HIM IN.
AND WHEN HE WENT TO WASHINGTON,
UNFORTUNATELY, HE DIDN'T HAVE A
FIRM PLAN, DIFFERENTIATE HIMSELF
FROM GEORGE BUSH, AND THIS WAS A
REFERENDUM AGAINST GEORGE BUSH.
IF IT HAD BEEN ABOUT NATIONAL
SECURITY, I THINK JOHN McCAIN
WOULD HAVE WON.
HE WAS AHEAD UNTIL THE CREDIT
CRISIS HID IN MID SEPTEMBER,
WHEN THAT HIT HE COULDN'T
EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM THAT
MESS.
>> Stephen: ISN'T IT INTERESTING
WITH A GUY WITH 14 HOUSES IS
DONE IN BY A CREDIT CRISIS?
>> THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
DON'T MEET THE MINIMUM PAYMENTS.
>> Jon: AT THIS POINT, IT IS NOT
LOOKING ALL THAT GOOD FOR McCAIN
YET.
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.
YOU KNOW, MEAT COULD GROW ON
TREES.
>> CALIFORNIA COULD HAVE AN
EARTHQUAKE, AND SNAP OFF LIKE A
GRAHAM CRACKER INTO THE
OCEAN.
>> IT IS THE PALIN 2012 PARTY
RIGHT NOW.
>> PALIN MAY BE THE
PRONUNCIATION, MAYBE PELON.
>> FRENCH?
>> MAYBE SO.
>> BUT YOU ARE THE FLAT TAX MAN,
RIGHT?
>> I AM, INDEED.
>> IN 2012 WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO
HAVE PALIN ON THE STUMP SAYING
"FLAT TAX"?
>> DOESN'T THAT SOUND WONDERFUL.
>> ( IMMITATING PALIN )
FLAT TAX!
>> WE COULD HAVE A BULL MOOSE
PARTY LIKE TEDDY ROOSEVELT HAD.
>> Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO RUN
AGAIN?
BECAUSE NOW WILL IS A HUGE POWER
VACUUM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.
IS THERE A CHANCE THAT
YOU STEP INTO THE VOID?
>> NO.
I AM AN AGITATOR NOW, WHICH WILL
BE GOOD NEWS...
>> Jon: I NEVER MET ANYONE WHO
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN AGITATOR
MORE THAN YOU.
YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR
PERSPECTIVE.
YOU RAN IN '96 AND
2000, AND NO SECRET YOU LOST
BOTH TIMES.
BUT IF McCAIN...
>> TO GEORGE BUSH.
IF McCAIN LOSES TONIGHT, GIVE
HIM SOME ADVICE.
HOW CAN HE SOOTHE HIMSELF WITH
HIS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS?
>> WELL, HE BETTER BE REALLY
NICE TO MRS. McCAIN,
AND PERHAPS JUST GO
ON A VACATION, READ THE "FORBES
MAGAZINE" AND HE WILL BE FINE.
( APPLAUSE )
GOOD ADVICE FOR ALL OF US, JOHN.
THAT'S ADVICE FOR ALL OF US.
>> Jon: WILL YOUR PLANS, DO YOU
PLAN ON SORT OF WORKING WITH THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HELPING
THEM RETOOL THEIR ECONOMIC BONA
FIDES, BECAUSE THAT REALLY
APPEARS TO BE WHAT DID THEM IN
IN THIS...
>> YES, IN WASHINGTON THEY GOT
MORE INTERESTING IN THE PAIN
TROJ IMAGINE PATRONAGE THAT
PRINCIPALS AND A LOT ARE BACK ON
THE PATH.
BOBBY GENERAL DELL, THE GOVERNOR
OF... AND THE PATH AND THE
PENDLE.
THE PATH, THE PENDLE AND THE
PALIN.
>> Jon: NICELY DONE.
WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY.
>> Stephen: I WILL TAKE THE
OTHER HAND.
>> LET'S DO BOTH.
>> Jon: STEVE FORBES, WHEN WE
COME BACK.
THANK YOU.
