"I AM BIN LADEN!
."
OF COURSE IN ALL THE HUBBUB
OVER THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN
WE CAN'T SELECT THE RACE TO
SELECT THE NEXT AMERICAN.
THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S INDECISION 2012.
GOOD LUCK, MY (BEEP) EDITION.
LAST WEEK FOX HOSTED THE FIRST
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
DEBATE.
AND THE OPEN STRUCK JUST THE
RIGHT TONE.
>> THE DEFINING ISSUES FACING
OUR NATION.
FROM TAKING DOWN THE MOST
WANTED MAN IN THE WORLD TO OUR
EXPLODING DEBT.
>> IS IT IMMORAL TO ROB OUR
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN'S
FUTURES.
>> JOBS.
AND SPIKING GAS PRICES.
NOW THE CANDIDATES ON WHAT
THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Jon: AND NOW PLEASE WELCOME
THE CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE POST APOCALYPTIC HELL
SCAPE.
THE FIRST QUESTION, HOW WOULD
YOU AS PRESIDENT WHEN OUR
DESPERATE CITIZENS BEGIN
EATING HUMAN FLESH, WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?
FOX, WE REPORT.
YOU RUN AND HIDE.
THIS SHOWDOWN HAS THE MOST
NOTABLE FOR WHO WASN'T THERE.
NAMES LIKE MITT ROMNEY SARAH
PALIN, NEWT GINGRICH, MICHELLE
BACHMANN, MITCH DANIELS,
DONALD TRUMP.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE GOING TO THROW THE REST
OF THE NAMES UP ON THE WEBB.
AS A RESULT, AMERICA GOT TO
MEET SOME OF THE LESSER KNOWN
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.
>> CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL OF
TEXAS, HERMAN CANE, FORMER
CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF GOD
MATTER'S PIZZA.
TIM PAWLENTY OF MINNESOTA.
RICK SANTORUM.
>> Jon: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
GOOGLE SOME OF THOSE
CANDIDATES.
ALTHOUGH I GUESS FOR THE LAST
GUY I PREFER YOU DIDN'T DO
THAT.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU DIDN'T GET
THAT JOKE, GO GOOGLE SAMTORUM
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL WAIT.
YEAH.
(BEEP) BELIEVE THAT?
SANTORUM MIGHT AS WELL CHANGE
HIS LAST NAME TO LEMON PARTY.
GO AHEAD.
GOOGLE THAT.
I'LL WAIT.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON.
PERHAPS THE MOST WELL KNOWN
CANDIDATE WAS 12th TERM TEXAS
CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL THE ONLY
PARTICIPANT CURRENTLY HOLDING
OFFICE.
>> WE DO NOT NEED SECRET
PRISONS NOR DO WE NEED THE
TORTURE THAT GOES ON IN THE
SECRET MILITARY PRISONS.
MAYBE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF SOME
PEOPLE BACK HERE AT HOME IF WE
WEREN'T SPENDING $1.5 TRILLION
A YEAR ON OUR MILL TARISM.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS A WEAK REPUBLICAN
FIELD.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
COMPROMISE YOUR LIBERTARIAN
PRINCIPLES A LITTLE BIT, FEED
THESE PEOPLE CHRISTIAN
CONSERVATIVE RED MEAT LIKE THE
THREE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN
THE WORLD ARE REAGAN, JESUS
AND REAGAN AGAIN.
GAYS CAN GET MARRIAGE LICENSES
WHEN THEY PRY THEM FROM MY
COLD DEAD HANDS.
(BEEP) COME ON.
GIVE IT TO THEM.
>> CONGRESSMAN PAUL, YOU SAY
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD
STAY OUT OF PEOPLE'S PERSONAL
HABITS.
MARIJUANA, COCAINE, EVEN
HEROIN SHOULD BE LEGAL IF
STATES WANT TO PERMIT IT.
YOU FEEL THE SAME ABOUT
PROSTITUTION AND GAY MARRIAGE.
>> Jon: HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.
WWW-JMD, WHAT WOULD JOHN
McCAIN DO.
THE NOMINATION CAN BE YOURS.
JUST TAKE THE PRINCIPLES THAT
MAKE YOU RESPECTED AND
DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM THEM.
>> WHAT YOU'RE INFERING IS YOU
KNOW WHAT?
IF WE LEGALIZE HEROIN TOMORROW
EVERYBODY WILL USE IT.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE WOULD USE
IT IF IT WAS LEGAL?
I BET NOBODY WOULD.
OH, YEAH, I NEED THE
GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
I DON'T WANT TO USE HAIR WIN
SO I NEED THESE LAWS.
>> Jon: NO!
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS PRAYER
IN SCHOOLS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU KEEP THIS UP AND YOU'LL
NEVER END UP A SHELL OF YOUR
FORMER SELF.
HELLO, OLD FRIEND.
I KNOW YOU'LL BE WATCHING
TONIGHT.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, YOU'RE A REAL MAVERICK.
WILL NO TRAGICALLY AMBITIOUS
POLITICIAN SPEED WALK AWAY
FROM THE MILDLY CENTRIST
POSITIONS THEY ONCE HELD
PERHAPS SOMEONE FOR WHOM THIS
CRAVEN REVERSAL PRINCIPLE NET
A SHORT-LIVED APPEARANCE AT
BEST?
>> YES, YOU.
>> TWO YEARS AGO YOU WOULD NOT
ENDORSE WATER BOARDING OF HIGH-
VALUE DETAINEES.
>> I SUPPORT ENHANCED
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES UNDER
LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> YOU DON'T OPPOSE GOVERNMENT
FUNDING FOR RESEARCH ON
EXISTING STEM CELL LINES
ALREADY DERIVED FROM EMBRYOS.
>> AS TO EMBRYONIC STEM CELL
RESEARCH I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD PURSUE THAT?
?
>> IN 2008 YOU SAID I SUPPORT
A REASONAL CAP-AND-TRADE
SYSTEM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.
>> I'VE MADE A MISTAKE AND
I'VE OPPOSED THAT
CAP-AND-TRADE MISS MISTAKE
SINCE.
>> Jon: WELL PLAYED McCAIN Jr.
LET'S SEE IF YOUR DIVE INTO
ABYSS HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS.
>> HOW MANY OF YOU THINK HE
WON THE DEBATE?
WELL, WE CAN STOP RIGHT THERE.
>> Jon: WHAT?
HERMAN KAINE, THE PIZZA GUY?
THE PIZZA GUY WHOSE PIZZA
CHAIN IS NAMED AFTER THE HEAD
OF THE MAFIA, THAT GUY?
EITHER HE'S AN EFFORTLESS
TALKING POINT MACHINE OR THE
DELICIOUSNESS OF HIS PIZZA HAS
CLOUDED VOTERS' MINDS.
>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS
WE HAVE THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW
TODAY IS TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION.
WE NEED TO GET GOVERNMENT OUT
OF THE WAY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION IT IS THE WORST
IN CURRENT HISTORY.
I STRONGLY SUPPORT TOTAL
REPLACING THE CURRENT CODE
WITH THE FAIR TAX.
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CREATE
JOBS.
BUSINESSES CREATE JOBS.
>> Jon: YEAH, I KNEW IT WASN'T
THE PIZZA.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
REPUBLICANS HAVE SURVEYED THE
FIELD AND BELIEVE THEIR BEST
CHANCE TO WIN IS A CHARISMATIC
BLACK GUY WITH A FUNNY NAME.
I MEAN, HERMAN.
YEAH, AMERICANS WILL VOTE FOR
