MY GUEST TONIGHT AN HISTORIAN
WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED HOT
TIME IN THE OLD TOWN, THE GREAT
HEAT WAVE OF 18896 -- 186996 AND
THE MAKING OF THEODORE
ROOSEVELT.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
EDWARD KOHN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
"HOT TIME IN THE OLD TOWN:  THE
GREAT HEAT WAVE OF 1896 AND THE
MAKING OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE HE IS AN
ICE SCULPTURE.
>> ICE DOES PLAY A ROLE IN THIS.
IT WAS A LIFE SAVING LUXURY AT
THE TIME AND HE CHAMPIONED THE
IDEA OF GIVING AWAY FREE ICE TO
THE POOR ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE.
>> Jon: THAT'S HOW HE MADE HIS
BONES.
THIS HEAT WAVE RELATED TO THE
HEAT WAVE WE HAD THIS SUMMER IN
TERMS OF TEMPERATURE.
LRN 103, 104 HIGH HUMIDITY.
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?
>> THAT IS ABOUT RIGHT.
THE PAST SUMMER WE'VE HAD IT
PRETTY BAD.
THREE DAY HEAT WAVES, THIS WAS
TEN DAYS, A WEEK AND A HALF OF
TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 90s
AT STREET LEAVE -- LEVEL AND
INSIDE THE TENMENTS ON THE LOWER
EAST SIDE THE TEMPERATURE COULD
EASILY REACH 120 DEGREES.
>> Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
THE WEATHERMAN, THE GUY WHO KEPT
CALLING IN, WOULD SAY IT WAS
LIKE 90 DEGREES AND LEFT HALF
WAY THROUGH IT AND WENT TO
MONTAUK.
>> THE OFFICIAL WEATHER GUYS WAS
TAKING THE READINGS ABOVE STREET
LEVEL.
WHENEVER THE NEW YORKERS READ
THEM THEY WERE LAUGH.
THEY WERE COMPLETELY
UNREALISTIC.
>> Jon: PEOPLE BY THE
THOUSANDS DIED DURING THIS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
1300 PEOPLE DIED DURING THIS
TEN-DAY HEAT WAVE, MOST OF THEM
THE WORKING POOR LIVING IN
TENMENTS ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE.
THEY WORKED THEMSELVES TO DEATH.
>> Jon: WEREN'T THERE
COMPLAINTS THAT THEY CONTRIBUTED
TO THEIR OWN DEATH BY BEING ON
THE ROOF.
THE ROOFS BAKED THEM AND MADE SO
IT THEY COULDN'T WORK AS WELL.
>> ONE PART OF THIS IS THAT THE
CITY DOES VIRTUALLY NOTHING
DURING THE HEAT WAVE.
ONE OF THE SIMPLEST THINGS THEY
COULD HAVE DONE WAS TO LIFT THE
BAN BY SLEEPING IN PARKS.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WENT TO
CENTRAL PARK, GOTTEN A BREATH OF
FRESH AIR.
NEW YORKERS SLEPT IN THE
STREETS, SIDEWALKS, GARBAGE
PWEUPBZ AND ON THE ROOFTOPS,
MADE OF BLACK TAR PAPER THAT
CONTINUED TO RADIATE HEAT DURING
THE NIGHT.
LOTS OF PEOPLE FELL TO THEIR
DEATHS.
>> Jon: ROSE VOLT AT THAT TIME
MADE A BOLD MOVE.
HE SAID WHAT IF WE TRIED TO SAVE
POOR PEOPLE'S LIVES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> SHOCKING IDEA.
>> Jon: WHAT IF THE GOVERNMENT
MAYBE WENT TO THESE -- AT THAT
TIME THERE WAS A BIG PROBLEM
WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS,
OBVIOUSLY, THE IRISH.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY APPARENTLY NOW FIT IN.
>> MORE OR LESS.
>> Jon: BUT BACK THEN WERE
AGITATED AGAINST.
THEY COULDN'T BUILD IRISH
CHURCHES OR I GUESS PUBS AS THEY
WOULD CALL THEM.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE WAS ANTI-IRISH SENTIMENT.
IT HAS NO BEARING ON TODAY.
WE'VE MOVED PAST THAT SORT OF
THING.
[LAUGHTER]
DID HE TAKE ANY -- WAS IT
DIFFICULT FOR HIM POLITCALLY TO
GET THIS TYPE OF PROGRESSIVE
MOVE MOVEMENT GOING?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS WAS A TIME WHERE GOVERNMENT
AT ALL LEVELS ABSOLUTELY REJECTS
ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR
INTERVENING INTO THE ECONOMY,
FOR ALLEVIATING THE PHRAOEULGT
OF THE POOR.
WHAT IMPRESSED ME WAS AT THE END
OF THE DAY IT WASN'T IMMIGRANT
WORKERS ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE
GOING TO VOTE FOR BROWNSTONE
BORN REPUBLICAN ROOSEVELT BUT
THIS WAS REAL AT TOURISM BY
ROOSEVELT.
HE TOURED THE WORST TENEMENT
DISTRICTS IN ON THE EAST SIDE TO
SEE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE ICE.
HE WATCHED AS MOTHERS WRAPPED
ICE AROUND THE FOREHEADS OF THE
BABIES.
HOW MANY PRESIDENTS BESIDES
BARACK OBAMA HAVE HAD SUCH
INTERMENT CONTACT WITH THE URBAN
POOR.
>> Jon: NIXON HAD A PARTICLON
GAME WHERE HE WOULD WRAP BABIES
HEADS IN ICE.
I BELIEVE IT WAS CONSIDERED
THANKSGIVING ENTERTAINMENT.
>> DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> Jon: I'M AN HISTORIAN.
WILLIAMS JENNINGS BRYANT
INTERSECTS AT THIS TIME.
HE COMES TO NEW YORK AT THE SAME
TIME.
THIS UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE
RUINATION OF HIS CAREER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
HE HAS WON THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION JUST A MONTH BEFORE.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM -- HE IS A
WESTERN POPULOUS.
HE REPRESENTS FARMERS AND AGRI
INTERESTS.
PEOPLE IN THE EAST AND NEW YORK
WERE SKEPTICAL OF HIS
NOMINATION.
HE TAKES THE BOLD MOVE DECIDING
TO COME TO NEW YORK, A PLACE HE
REFERS TO AS THE ENEMY'S
COUNTRY.
HE DOES THIS AT THE HEIGHT OF
HEAT WAVE TO GIVE A RALLY IN
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.
>> Jon: THEY THINK THEY ARE
GOING TO GET ANOTHER CROSS OF
GOLD SPEECH.
THEY DON'T GET IT.
TWO MINUTES INTO THE SPEECH WHAT
HAPPENS?
>> THOUSANDS OF NEW YORKERS
BEGIN TO LEAVE AND EVEN THE
SYMPATHETIC DEMOCRATIC PAPERS
SAY THE SPEECH WAS AN ABSOLUTE
FAILURE.
>> Jon: AND THAT WAS THE END
OF THAT.
>> THAT WAS THE END OF THAT.
>> Jon: IT'S A FASCINATING
CONFLEWENCE OF ALL DIFFERENT
THINGS AND AL GORE'S CRUSADE
AGAINST TKPWORPLG AT THE TIME
STILL NOT SUCCESSFUL.
