>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
WE GOT THE AUTHOR MICHAEL LEWIS
WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THE
PROGRAM.
HE'S GOING TO BE HERE TO TALK
ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK CALLED
"BOOMERANG" SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE DOING AND... OH,
WOW!
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WORKED ON THAT
FOR THREE HOURS.
(LAUGHTER)
LIKE "PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANNY."
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON
THIS, I DON'T KNOW WHY.
REALLY?
ALL RIGHT.
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE,
REPUBLICAN OF NEW JERSEY IN
TRENTON, NEW JERSEY, TODAY AT
1:00 P.M. EASTERN (BLEEP) HOLE
TIME MAKING A STUNNING
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> .
>> WHAT I'VE ALWAYS FELT WAS THE
RIGHT DECISION REMAINS THE RIGHT
DECISION TODAY.
NOW IS NOT MY TIME.
THE ANSWER WAS NEVER ANYTHING
BUT NO.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, CHRIS
CHRISTIE 2012!
CHRIS... WAIT.
WHAT?
(LAUGHTER)
NO?
OH.
WELL, HAVING SAID HE WASN'T
GOING TO RUN IN PRIVATE, HAVING
SAID IT ON THE TELEVISION,
HAVING SAID IT TO PRINT
REPORTERS, HAVING TAGGED IT ON
WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A
CONDEMNED TRENTON BUILDING...
(LAUGHTER).
HAVING DEMONSTRATED HIS POSITION
WHILE ATTENDING A DEVILS GAME.
(LAUGHTER)
WHO PAYS FOR PRESEASON GAMES?
IT'S OVER.
FINALLY CHRISTIE COULD PROCEED
WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE
DEDICATED TO MORE PRESSING
ISSUES.
>> WHAT I SAID WAS I'D
RECONSIDER MY NO AND I DID.
BUT THE NO NEVER CHANGED.
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
ELSE, IT'S NOT THERE.
IT'S A NO.
NO.
BECAUSE I SAID NO.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS JOB.
I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
THIS MORNING AND TOLD THEM THE
ANSWER IS NO.
THAT'S NOT EVEN A RELEVANT
QUESTION ANYMORE BECAUSE I'VE
MADE THE DECISION NOT TO RUN.
I KNOW IT'S YOUR GUYS JOB TO ASK
ME THIS QUESTION A DOZEN
DIFFERENT WAYS AND I'LL ANSWER
IT ALMOST A DOZEN DIFFERENT
WAYS.
IN THE END, THE ANSWER REMAINS
THE SAME AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
>> Jon: GOVERNOR CHRISTIE,
OVER HERE, ONE QUESTION OVER
HERE.
I'M FROM THE "TRENTON WASN'T
LISTENING TIMES" AND THE
SECAUCUS "CAN'T GET IT THROUGH
MY (BLEEP)ING HEAD" MONTHLY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO SAY
YOU SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN
2012?
(LAUGHTER)
WE'RE ONLY PIECING TOGETHER THAT
AFTER CHRISTIE STATED HE WOULD
NOT RUN.
THE REPORTERS CONTINUED TO
REPEATEDLY ASK HIM IF HE MIGHT
RUN BECAUSE WE COULDN'T ACTUALLY
HEAR THEIR QUESTIONS.
WE COULD ONLY GAUGE THE
RIDICULOUSNESS OF THEIR
QUESTIONS BY CHRISTIE'S ANSWERS.
LET'S TRY ANOTHER ANSWER.
>> IT'S NOT A NEWS FLASH TO ME
THAT I'M OVERWEIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I GUESS THE QUESTION
THERE WAS "IS IT A NEWS FLASH TO
YOU THAT YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT?"
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY THAT, QUESTION WAS
ABOUT WHETHER GOVERNOR CHRISTIE
APPRECIATES THE MULTITUDE OF
WEIGHT-BASE HUED MORTAR ON
TELEVISION PROGRAMS.
>> FOR ME THEIR JOB IS TO BE
FUNNY AND IF ONE OF THE THINGS
THEY WANT TO MAKE FUN OF IS MY
WEIGHT IT'S FAIR GAME.
I'M A PUBLIC FIGURE.
THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF IT.
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY
ACTUALLY ARE FUNNY.
SO THAT I CAN AT LEAST LAUGH
ABOUT IT WHILE THEY'RE MOCKING
ME, YOU KNOW?
SOME OF THE STUFF I DIDN'T SEE
INITIALLY AND MY SON WOULD GO
"DAD, DID YOU SEE THIS ONE?"
SO HE'D BEEN GROUNDED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BOOM!
NOW THAT'S A JERSEY GUY.
I GOT TO SAY, I LIKE THIS GUY,
HE'S A STRAIGHT TALKER, DOESN'T
SPEAK IN TALKING POINTS.
HE'S AUTHENTIC.
HE SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD HE LEFT THE
