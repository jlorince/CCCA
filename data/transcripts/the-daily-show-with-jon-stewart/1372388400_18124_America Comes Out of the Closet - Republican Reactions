BUT LOOK, LOOK, JUSTICE
SCALIA IS FAR FROM ALONE IN
HIS DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE
RULING.
YESTERDAY MORE THAN A DOZEN
MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN
STUDY COMMITTEE GOT TOGETHER
IN FRONT OF LESS THAN A
DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PRESS
TO SHARE THEIR FEELINGS.
>> THE SUPREME COURT WANT TO
ITS DICTATE TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WHAT ELECTED
LEGISLATORS CAN DO REGARDING
FEDERAL LAW.
>> AND NOW WE HAVE AN
EFFECTIVE OLIGARCHEE OF FIVE
WITHOUT DECIDE WHAT THE MOST
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF OUR
DAY.
>> IT'S A SAD DAY WHEN
UNELECTED JUDGES CHANGE THE
DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE AND
TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE WILL
OF VOTERS.
>> YEAH, BUT HERE'S THE
THING ABOUT THAT.
IF WE DID EVERYTHING
AMERICAN VOTESERS WANTED, WE
WOULD LONG AGO HAVE REPLACED
OUR CLEAN WATER SUPPLY WITH
MOUNTAIN DEW AND RED BULL.
ED WHOLE-- THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE SUPREME COURT IS TO
KEEP US IN CHECK.
SOMETIMES WE AS A NATION
MAKE BAD DECISIONS.
AND THE COURT HAS TO COME IN
AND SAY SORRY, BUDDY, GIVE
US YOUR KEYS, YOU'RE REALLY
GOING REGRET SEGREGATING
SCHOOLS TOMORROW MORNING.
THERE IS A REASON THAT LADY
JUSTICE IS BLINDFOLDED
HOLDING SCALES AND NOT
GIVING A WINK AND A THUMBS
UP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S THE POINT OF THE
SUPREME COURT.
BUT LOOK, I FIND IT HARD TO
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS JUST
STRICTLY AN INTELLECTUAL
ARGUMENT.
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS ANGER AT
THE SUPREME COURT MIGHT BE
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
>> THE SUPREME COURT THOUGH
THEY MAY THINK SO, HAVE NOT
YET ARISEN TO THE LEVEL OF
GOD.
>> THEY WERE NOT AWARE THAT
THE MOST WISE MAN IN HISTORY
SOLOMAN SAID THERE'S NOTHING
NEW UNDER THE SUN.
>> NOW, NOW, NOW, LET'S BE
FAIR, HOLD ON.
SALOMON DID SAY THAT, IN
FACT, HE MIGHT HAVE SAID IT
TO ONE OF HIS 700 WIVES OR
ONE OF HIS 300 CONCUBINES
BUT I'M SORRY YOU WERE
CLEARLY WARMING UP TO
SOMETHING.
>> WHAT WE NOW HAVE TODAY IS
A HOLY QUINTET WITHOUT GOES
AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE
AND NATURE'S GUIDE.
>> REALLY?
IF YOUR BRAIN CAN'T PROCESS
GOD'S CREATURES ENJOYING
DIFFERENT KINDS OF SEX, YOU
DON'T WANT TO BRING NATURE
INTO THIS.
BECAUSE NATURE IS WHERE DOGS
HUMP EACH OTHER IN THE FACE,
IN THE FACE, THAT'S NATURE
THAT IS ALL NATURAL, MY
FRIEND.
JUST AS GOD INTENDED.
WHOA, WHOA!
(APPLAUSE)
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
LET'S TRY AND ELEVATE THIS
DECADE-- DECADE-- DEBATE,
ENOUGH WITH YOU CANNOT UNSEE
WHAT YOU JUST SAW.
LET'S ELEVATE THIS DEBATE.
ENOUGH FROM THE HOUSE MBS.
LET'S HEAR FROM A UNITED
STATES SENATOR.
>> I THINK THIS IS A
CONUNDRUM.
>> IF WE HAVE NO LAWS ON
THIS PEOPLE TAKE IT TO ONE
EXTENSION FURTHER, DOES IT
HAVE TO BE HUMANS.
>> WHAT IS IT-- WHAT IS IT
WITH THESE PEOPLE AND ANIMALS?
EVERY TIME, THIS IS THE ONLY
ISSUE AS WELL WHERE YOU GO
THERE, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GO
THERE WITH O BAM ARCARE, OH,
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT,
WHAT IS NEXT, ARE WE GOING
TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO
TURTLES?
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT SEX THAT YOU
ARE DEFINITELY NOT PERVERTED
BRAINS GO STRAIGHT TO
ANIMALS.
LOOK, LOOK, SENATOR, IT
SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A
PERSONAL FIGHT FOR YOU.
PERHAPS AND I'M JUST
GUESSING, YOU'RE IN A
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANIMAL AND
YOU FEAR THAT THIS COURT
RULING IS PUSHING YOU IN A
DIRECTION WHERE YOU WILL BE
PRESSURED TO GET MARRIED.
BUT RELAX.
YOU DON'T NEED A PIECE OF
PAPER TO DEFINE YOUR LOVE.
AS A WISEMAN ONCE SAID, KEEP--
(LAU
