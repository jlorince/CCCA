>> HELLO.
THANK YOU!
YOU'RE HAVING KIND.
WELCOME THE "DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A FINE PROGRAM.
MAZ, AUTHOR OF "THE WAY OF THE
KNIFE," STUNY EXPOAS A ON OUR
NATION'S TOP SPIES, CHEF.
AS YOU KNOW, THIS COUNTRY HAS
SUFFERED.
AND OF COURSE THE CONTINUING
SCOURGE OF GUN VIOLENCE.
ALONG WITH THE TERRIBLE STORIES
ARE SOME UPLIFTING STORIES OF SO
MANY HEROS THAT HAVE EMERGED
FROM THESE TRAGEDIES SO WE CAN
TAKE SOLACE THAT THOSE PEOPLE
ARE OUT THERE AND THAT OUR
NATION'S LEADERS ARE ALSO ON THE
CASE.
>> ON WEDNESDAY, THE SENATE
BLOCKED THE MOST FAR-REACHING
GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION IN TWO
DECADES.
>> Jon:  I'M SORRY, DID I
SAY ON THE CASE?
I MEAN KILL MY SOUL.
>> SENATORS VOTED DOWN AN SWP
BAN.
>> AND AGAINST A BAN ON
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE.
>> THE U.S. SENATE HAS VOTED
DOWN THE COMPROMISE DEAL ON
EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS.
THE VOTE WAS 54 FOR THE EXTENDED
BACKGROUND CHECKS, 46 AGAINST.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  AS TO THAT LAST
ONE, EXPANDING BACKGROUND CHECKS
TO COVER GUN SHOWS AND INTERNET
SALES.
ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
COULD TAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS
86% SUPPORT OF ALL AMERICANS AND
AN EIGHT-VOTE MAJORITY IN THE
SENATE ITSELF AS A NO.
THAT'S A NO.
DID THESE ( BLEEP )-- I THINK
THAT'S TRADEMARKED BY DELTA
GAMMA.
( LAUGHTER ).
DID-- REALLY?
YOU ALREADY READ-- GOTTA TELL
YOU.
THE THE INTERNET MOVES FAST!
( LAUGHTER )
DID THESE GUYS PASS ANYTHING OF
SUBSTANCE?
>> THIS AMENDMENT WILL ENSURE
THAT GUN OWNERS ACROSS THE
NATION DO NOT HAVE THEIR PRIVATE
GUN OWNER INFORMATION PUBLICLY
RELEASED.
>> THE YAYS ARE 67, THE NAYS ARE
30.
THE AMENDMENT IS AGREESED TO.
>> Jon:  WE CAN'T PUBLISH
WITH GUN
