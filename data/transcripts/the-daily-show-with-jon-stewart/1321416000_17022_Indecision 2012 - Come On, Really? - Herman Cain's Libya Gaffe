>> Jon: MORE FOR MORE ON THE
FALLOUT, WE TURN SENIOR
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JASON
JONES WHO'S AT CAMPAIGN
HEADQUARTERS.
AS YOU HEARD IN THE QUESTION
PREVIOUSLY, DOES HERMAN CAIN'S
ANSWER ON LIBYA CONTINUE TO JUST
REINFORCE THE IDEA HE'S NOT YET
READY TO COMPETE ON A POLICY
LEVEL WITH THE OTHER G.O.P.
CANDIDATES?
>> JON, BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT LIB
YARKS CAIN'S ADVISORS ARE
ADAMANTLY INSISTING THAT THIS
SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL IS NOT
OVER AND THAT WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
MORE WOMEN COULD STILL BE OUT
THERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: CAIN'S ADVISORS?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES HERE,
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT SOME OBSCURE
FOREIGN WAR!
THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE
ISSUES THAT MATTER: LIKE HERMAN
CAIN'S POSSIBLY UNSTOPPABLE URGE
TO PUT HIS HAND-- OR HANDS, OR
FEET-- UP LADIES' SKIRTS.
>> Jon: HERMAN CAIN'S ADVISORS
WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM
LIBYA TO HERMAN CAIN'S SEXUAL
HARASSMENT SCANDAL?
>> YES.
THEAFL THE LONGER THE LAMESTREAM
MEDIA FOCUSES ON FOREIGN
POLICY-- OR REALLY POLICY IN
GENERAL-- THE MORE IT HURTS
THEIR GUY.
>> Jon: RIGHT, BUT I'M NOT
SURE THAT CHARGES OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AND CONFUSION OTHER
HIS CAMPAIGN'S HANDLING OF IT
HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HELP TO
FEEL CAIN, EITHER.
>> RIGHT.
RIGHT.
BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING
REAL QUICK.
>> LIBYA.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: PEOPLE CAN TAKE A
SEXUAL CREEP IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
BUT NOBODY'S GOING FOR THAT!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE...
WHAT'S THE CAMPAIGN DO NOW?
>> WELL, THEY'RE GOING REJIGGER
THEIR STRATEGY.
IT'S ALREADY STARTING WITH NEW
CAMPAIGN SLOGANS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
THEY'RE ALSO CONSIDERING THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
OR, JON, MAYBE SOMETHING A
LITTLE MORE CLASSIC.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: NONE OF THOSE SEEM
PARTICULARLY HELPFUL.
SNEUM OR HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK
TO TALKING ABOUT LIBYA.
>> Jon: POINT TAKEN, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH,
