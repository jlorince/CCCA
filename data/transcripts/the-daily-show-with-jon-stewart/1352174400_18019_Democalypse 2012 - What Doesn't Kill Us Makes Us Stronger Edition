>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST JOURNALIST MARTHA RADDATZ WILL BE HERE, MODERATOR AND THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S
VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.
A VERY ROUGH WEEKEND IN THE TRI-STATE AREA.
I'M SURE BY NOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE.
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT.
THESE ARE MARATHON RUNNERS WHO CHANNELED THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE
MARATHON INTO VOLUNTEERING TO HELP STORM CLEAN-UP.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS VERY, VERY MOVING.
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU NOT THAT ANNOYED BY MARATHON RUNNERS.
NOT QUITE.
OBVIOUSLY ALL DONATIONS STILL GREATLY APPRECIATED.
THE SANDY RELIEF FUND DOT-ORG.
YOUR I-TUNES DOT-COM SLASH RED CROSS.
YOU HAVE YOUR UNITED WAY NYC DOT-ORGAN THE SALVATION ARMY USA DOT-ORG.
WE'LL GIVE YOU THE WEBSITES FOR THE GIANT NOR'EASTER COMING ON WEDNESDAY.
SOMEHOW WE HAVE ANNOYED GOD.
WE'LL BEGIN TONIGHT AN HOUR AWAY FROM ELECTION DAY.
SHOULD ALREADY BE ELECTION DAY BUT OF COURSE SATURDAY NIGHT THEY ADDED ANOTHER [BLEEP] HOUR
SO WE COULD STRETCH THIS THING OUT.
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME IS TAKEN AWAY.
THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER HOUR SO THE ELECTION TAKES LONGER.
STARTING TO WONDER IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET TO THE ELECTION OR IF THEY'LL KEEP ADDING HOURS THE
CLOSER WE GET LIKE XENO'S ELECTORAL PARADOX.
YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP.
>> THE CANDIDATES ARE CRISS-CROSSING THESE BATTLE GROUND STATES
>> QUITE A VIRGINIA BEACH WE WELCOME
>> 17,000 HELLO BOLDER 25,000 PEOPLE QUITE A WELCOME 30-35,000 HELLO VIRGINIA!
JOE BIDEN HAD 090 IN COLORADO.
>> Jon: 900.
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HIGH FOR BIDEN, BUT TO BE FAIR THEY WERE GIVING OUT FOOD AND BALLOONS.
THE CANDIDATES ARE TAKING A CHANCE TO MAKE FINAL ARGUMENT TO AMERICA'S VOTERS
>> MITT ROMNEY...
CROWD: BOO!
DON'T BOO.
VOTE.
VOTE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VOTING IS THE BEST REVENGE.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED HIS SUPPORTERS TO VOTE FOR REVENGE.
>> CROWD: BOO!
INSTEAD I ASK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: I WANT THIS OVER!
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT COMMENT OR MAYBE THIS IS THE MILK I DRANK FROM A BODEGO THAT
LOST POWER DURING THE BLACKOUT BUT I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT.
IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN REALLY VOTE FOR REVENGE OR LOVE OF COUNTRY, THEY'D BE KICKING
BOTH YOUR ASSES IN THE POLLS.
FOR MORE ON THE CAMPAIGN CLOSING HOURS LET'S GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS AND AASIF MANDVI.
THEY ARE WITH THE CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW.
JESSICA, YOU'RE AT OBAMA'S FINAL RALLY IN DES MOINES
>> THE MOOD HERE IS POSITIVELY ELECTRIC.
J-Z IS KILLING IT.
AND SINCE THIS IS IOWA, THEY THINK HE'S ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT CHEESE.
WHICH THEY REALLY LIKE SO IT'S A VERY POSITIVE MESSAGE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AASIF MANDVI YOU'RE WITH THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN IN MANCHESTER NEW HAMPSHIRE
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JON.
DIFFERENT FEELING HERE.
ROMNEY IS TALKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF RE-ELECTING OBAMA: HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, SLOW GROWTH.
SOMETHING WILL RISE FROM THE SEA AND DESTROY THE CITY.
STANDARD SPEECH
>> Jon: WHAT IS THAT IN THE BACKGROUND?
>> YOU HEAR THAT TOO.
BECAUSE NOBODY IS PLAYING IT.
THERE IS NO DJ, NOTHING.
THERE IS NO SOUND SYSTEM.
IT'S REALLY KIND OF EERIE
>> Jon: HAVE YOU SEEN THE HEADLINER YET?
>> NO.
SPRINGSTEEN DOESN'T GO ON FOR ANOTHER HOUR.
DAVE MATTHEWS WAS HERE.
KATIE PERRY ROCKED IT.
>> Jon: AASIF MANDVI, WHAT IS IT LIKE WHERE YOU ARE?
>> A MEATLOAF SIGHTING A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
♪ FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA ♪♪
>> SO I THINK HE'S NOT COMING BACK UNTIL HE'S NO LONGER IN HEAT.
>> Jon: BOTH CANDIDATES REALLY LOOK PRETTY EXHAUSTED AT THIS POINT
>> TRY BROKEN.
TWO YEARS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WILL DO THAT TO YOU
>> TRY SEVEN YEARS.
WHEN ROMNEY STARTED RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO HAD THE NUMBER ONE RECORD?
AND THE GUY STILL WON'T TRY COFFEE.
>> YES, JON.
NO MATTER WHO WINS TOMORROW'S ELECTION, ONE THING IS SURE
>> THAT PERSON WILL BE A SAD, EMPTY 'EM BITTERED HUSK OF A MAN.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
