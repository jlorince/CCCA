>> Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE'S
THE GOVERNOR OF GREAT STATE OF
TEXAS.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED FED UP
OUR FIGHT TO SAVE AMERICA FROM
WASHINGTON.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY.
SIR --
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> YOU'LL FIRED UP TONIGHT.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR BEING HERE.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, SIR.
>> Jon: TAKING THE TIME.
I KNOW YOU ARE A BUSY MAN WITH
WHAT RUNNING A STATE.
>> YES.
>> Jon: WHAT HAS YOU, GOVERNOR
FED UP SUCK -- WHAT WOULD YOU
SAY?
>> BEING TOLD HOW TO RUN OUR
BUSINESS.
WHETHER YOU PUT TOO MUCH SALT ON
THE FOOD AND UP TO THE
LIGHTBULLINGS IN YOUR HOUSE.
>> Jon: THE SALT PART OR THE
LIGHT BULB PART?
>> SERIOUSLY.
IT DOCUMENTS -- JORCH SHOULD
THEY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU HOW
MUCH LEAD CAN BE IN YOUR PAINT
OR -- SALMONELLA CAN BE --
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE E.P.A. FLEXIBLE
PERMITTING IN THE STATE OF TEXAS
WE CLEANED UP OUR AIR IN TEXAS
OVER THE LAST DECADE MORE THAN
ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION.
FLEXIBLE PROCESS PUT INTO PLACE
BY ANN RICHARDS, A DEMOCRAT
GOVERNOR AND APPROVED BY THE
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.
THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRAT VERSUS
REPUBLICAN THING.
THIS ADMINISTRATION CAME IN
ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND YOU SAID,
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T REALLY THINK
WE LIKE THE WAY YOU ARE DOING
THE PERMITTING AND WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE IT OVER.
I SAID WAIT A MINUTE, WE CLEANED
OUR AIR UP MORE THAN ANY OTHER
STATE IN THE NATION WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF GEORGIA.
>> Jon: THEY HAD SOME -- TO BE
FAIR -- VERY DIRTY AIR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WE DID A GOOD JOB.
WE DID IT OUR WAY.
THE FLEXIBLE PERMITTING.
AND -- I MIGHT ADD --
>> Jon: WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T
CLEAN UP THE AIR.
WOULD YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT
CLEAN IT UP.
IS YOUR SUGGESTION THAT THE
STATES SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO
EITHER CLEAN UP THEIR AIR OR
NOT?
>> HERE IS WHAT I THINK:  THE
STATES ARE BY AND LARGE RUN BY
THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN
WHO AREN'T GOING TO LET THEIR
ENVIRONMENT GOOD TO HELL IN A
HAND BASKET.
IF YOU HAD A GOVERNOR OR
GOVERNMENT IN THERE THAT WAS
DOING THAT PEOPLE WOULD KICK
THEM OUT.
THIS BOOK IS ABOUT FREEDOM.
>> Jon: THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR
STATE WAS GEORGE BUSH BEFORE
YOU.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Jon: WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR
OF TEXAS I'M ASSUMING YOU
BELIEVE HE WAS A THOUGHTFUL AND
I CAN'T GET THE WORD YOU USED
INDIVIDUAL.
WHEN HE WENT TO WASHINGTON DID
HE LOSE HIS MIND?
OR IS IT --
[LAUGHTER]
-- BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME
PERSON.
IF YOU WERE THE GOVERNOR OF
TEXAS AND YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF
A SMART AND THOUGHTFUL MAN, WHEN
DBU TO WASHINGTON DO THEY
CLASSIFY YOUR PLAIN -- CALCIFY
YOUR BRING?
>> I'VE SAID THAT FROM TIME TO
TIME.
PEOPLE AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
PRESIDENT BUSH BUT I'M TALKING
ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY
CROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER
SOMETHING HAPPENS FROM TIME TO
TIME.
IT'S LIKE A VIRUS.
MAYBE THEY SPEW IT OUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.
>> Jon: YOU BELIEVE WASHINGTON
IS A HOME OF A TYPE OF EBOLA.
GETS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM
AND --
[LAUGHTER]
>> I CAN'T SAY --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU UNDERSTAND MY
POINT.
>> I THINK THEY GET ABSORBED
WITH THE WASHINGTON CULTURE, THE
LOBBYISTS, THE PROFIT -- SPECIAL
INTERESTS, ALL THE THINGS IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
THEY ARE LIVING UP THERE VERY
REMOVED FROM THE STATE.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT GOVERNORS
IS WE'RE RIGHT THERE WITH THE
PEOPLE.
WE'RE TALKING TO THEM.
I GOOD TO CHURCH WITH THEM.
I SHOP WITH THEM I'M TRAVELING
THE STATE.
>> Jon: DOES THAT FREAK THEM
OUT.
IF A GUY IS LIKE I GOTTA PICK UP
MILK.
PERRY IS THE CAR AND HE'S
WALKING TO THE CART.
IT'S FREAKY.
>> I'M A BASKET GUY.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
HERE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
WE'LL TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK MORE
ABOUT THIS IDEA OF STATE CONTROL
VERSUS FEDERAL CONTROL.
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE
