>> Jon:  HEY, EVERYBODY,WELCOME BACK.
THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW UNTIL --WE'RE OFF ALL NEXT WEEK.
AND NEXT WEEK-->> Audience: OOOH!
>> Jon:  REALLY?
HOW MUCH ENTERTAINMENT DO YOUPEOPLE NEED?
WE'RE OFF ALL NEXT WEEK, SO WEWILL MISS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT,
A YOUNG MAN NAMED DAVIDLETTERMAN, WILL BE SIGNING OFF
FROM HIS PROGRAM.
WE WILL NOT BE HERE FOR THAT,AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY WHAT A
REMARKABLE HONOR IT HAS BEEN FORME TO HAVE GONE ON HIS SHOW.
HE WAS FOR ME-- AND I THINK MANYCOMICS IN MY GENERATION-- AN
INCREDIBLE EPIPHANY OF HOW ATALK SHOW-- OR HOW
ENTERTAINMENT, OR HOW TELEVISION-- FOR GOD'S SAKE, THE MAN PUT A
CAMERA ON A MONKEY.
IT SEEMS SO SIMPLE NOW!
( LAUGHTER )BUT BACK THEN, IT WAS MIND
BLOWING.
AND I USED TO WATCH THAT SHOWSINCE THE EARLY 80s, AND JUST
FELL IN LOVE WITH THE JOY THATTHEY HAD AND THAT THEY BROUGHT.
THERE ARE SO FEW PEOPLE THAT CANINNOVATE THAT FORMAT AND THEN TO
HAVE THE THE KIND OF LONGEVITY--TO BE AN INNOVATOR WITH
LONGEVITY IS-- I MEAN, DAMN, THELIST IS, I THINK, DAVE.
I THINK THE LIST IS DAVE.
LORNE, ON A WHOLE OTHER THING,BUT DAVE AS A PERFORMER.
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I HAD A SHOWVERY SIMILAR TO HIS THAT DID NOT
SHARE EITHER THE INNOVATION PARTOR CERTAINLY THE LONGEVITY PART
( LAUGHTER )AND DAVE LETTERMAN WAS KIND
ENOUGH TO COME TO OUR FINALBROADCAST AND BE THE GUEST, AND
HE SINGLEHANDEDLY TURNED WHATWAS A FUNERIAL ATMOSPHERE INTO A
CELEBRATION JUST BY HISPRESENCE.
HE LIFTED ALL OF OUR SPIRITS,AND HE SAID TO ME-- I'LL NEVER
FORGET-- "DO NOT CONFUSECANCELLATION WITH FAILURE."
AND I THANK HIM FOR ALL THEAMAZING YEARS OF TELEVISION AND
FOR THAT WONDERFUL PIECE OFADVICE.
SO CHEERS TO YOU.
GODSPEED, YOUNG MAN.
HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
>> YOU KNOW, IF THEY WANTED THEYCOULD ARREST ME.
I SCREWED UP THE ACADEMY AWARDS.
IS THAT A VIOLATION.
THEY COULD ARREST ME, AND SO ITOOK A COUPLE OF DAYS AND
THOUGHT, ALL RIGHT, I SCREWEDUP THE ACADEMY AWARDS.
I DON'T CARE.
( LAUGHTER )AND NOW, I SCREWED UP THE
ACADEMY AWARDS, AND I COULDN'TBE MORE PROUD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> WELL, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.
