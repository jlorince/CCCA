>> OH, I HAVE TO DO A LOT OFMAKING UP WITH HIM AFTER I DO
"THE HOWARD STERN SHOW."
>> Jon: OH NO, I CAN IMAGINE.>> BUT ON THIS SHOW...
TOO FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THATDARK CHAPTER OF AMERICAN
HISTORY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHEN AMERICAN CITIZENS OFJAPANESE ANCESTRY WERE SUMMARILY
ROUNDED UP WITH NO CHARGES, NOTRIAL, NO DUE PROCESS, YOU KNOW,
THE CORE PILLAR OF OURJUSTICE SYSTEM, AND PUT
IN BARBWIRE PRISON CAMPS SIMPLYBECAUSE WE HAPPENED TO LOOK LIKE
THE THE PEOPLE WHO BOMBEDPEARL HARBOR.
NOW, I WAS, I HAD JUST TURNEDFIVE YEARS OLD.
BUT I STILL REMEMBER THAT DAYWHEN MY PARENTS DRESSED MY
BROTHER AND MY BABY SISTER ANDME. THEY GOT US UP VERY EARLY
IN THE MORNING AND DRESSED USHURRIEDLY.
WE WERE IN THE LIVING ROOM, MYBROTHER AND I, LOOKING OUT THE
WINDOW, AND WE SAW TWO AMERICANSOLDIERS MARCHING UP THE
DRIVEWAY WITH BAYONETS ON THEIRRIFLES.
THEY STOMPED UP THE FRONT PORCH,BANGED ON THE DOOR, AND MY
FATHER ANSWERED IT AND WE WERELITERALLY ORDERED OUT OF OUR
HOMES AT GUNPOINT.
MY PARENTS HAD LITTLE LUGGAGESFOR US TO CARRY.
AND WE WENT OUT AND WE WERESTANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY WAITING
FOR MY MOTHER TO COME OUT.
AND WHEN SHE DID COME OUT, SHEWAS CARRYING THE BABY IN ONE
ARM, A HUGE DUFFEL BAG IN THEOTHER AND TEARS WERE
STREAMING DOWN HER FACE.
IT'S A PICTURE I'LL NEVER BEABLE TO FORGET.
AND WE WERE BEHIND THOSEBARBWIRE FENCES FOR THE DURATION
OF THE WAR.
WE WERE SENT... THERE WERE TENCAMPS ALL TOGETHER, ALL IN THE
MOST DESOLATE PLACES, HELLISHPLACES.
THERE WERE TWO ON THE BLISTERINGHOT DESERT OF ARIZONA, IF YOU
CAN IMAGINE THAT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE WERE SENT TO THE SWAMPS OFARKANSAS.
AND THERE WERE OTHERS IN THEWASTELANDS OF WYOMING, IDAHO,
UTAH, COLORADO.
IT WAS A DARK CHAPTER OFAMERICAN HISTORY.
>> Jon: COULD YOU UNDERSTAND ASA CHILD WHAT HAD HAPPENED?
DID YOUR, DID YOUR FATHER, DIDYOUR MOTHER, WERE THEY ABLE TO
IMPART TO YOU WHAT THIS WAS?
I MEAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WOULDMAKE ANY SENSE.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOW, BUTWHAT DID YOU THINK WAS
HAPPENING?
>> WELL, MY PARENTS TOLD US THATWE WERE GOING FOR A LONG
VACATION TO A PLACE CALLEDARKANSAS, AND THAT SOUNDED
EXOTIC, ARKANSAS.
[LAUGHTER]WE'D NEVER HEARD OF THAT PLACE.
AND A VACATION.AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN
WE PUT ON THESE TRAINSWITH ARMED GUARDS AT BOTH
ENDS OF EACH CAR, BEING TREATEDLIKE CRIMINALS, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: AMERICAN CITIZENS.
>> INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NO CHARGES. YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT EVERYONE TOOK THEIRVACATIONS WITH GUARDS LIKE THAT.
I WAS AN INNOCENT CHILD.
AND, ANOTHER SCENE I REMEMBERNOW AS AN ADULT IS EVERY MORNING
AT SCHOOL, AND THEY HAD SCHOOLSIN THOSE BARRACKS, WE STARTED
AT SCHOOL, AND THEY HAD SCHOOLSIN THOSE BARRACKS, WE STARTED
THE DAY WITH THE PLEDGE OFALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG.
I COULD SEE THE BARBWIREFENCE...
>> Jon: IN THIS CAMP.
>> IN THIS CAMP.
>> Jon: THAT THEY HADTAKEN YOU TO.
TAKEN YOU FROM YOUR HOME AND PUTYOU IN THIS CAMP.
>> AND THERE WAS THE AMERICANFLAG FLYING OVER THE CAMP, BUT I
COULD ALSO SEE THE BARBWIREFENCE AND THE SENTRY TOWERS WITH
THE MACHINE GUNS POINTED AT USFROM MY SCHOOLHOUSE WINDOW
AS I RECITED THE WORDS "WITHLIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL,"
AN NNOCENT KID,RECITING WORDS THAT --
>> Jon: IT'S STUNNING. DID, DOYOU REMEMBER YOUR
PARENTS CARRYING ANYTHING WITHTHEM, LIKE ANGER OR BITTERNESS?
IT'S THE TYPE OF THING I CAN'TIMAGINE EVER GETTING OVER
EMOTIONALLY OR FORGIVING?
>> WHEN I BECAME A TEENAGER, IREALLY BECAME CURIOUS ABOUT MY
CHILDHOOD INCARCERATION. AND WEHAD, MY FATHER
AND I HAD LONG AFTER-DINNERCONVERSATIONS.
AND WHAT I REMEMBER FROM THOSECONVERSATIONS IS THAT HE SAID,
"OUR DEMOCRACY IS A PEOPLE'SDEMOCRACY, AND IT CAN BE AS
GREAT AS THE PEOPLE CAN BE, BUTIT'S ALSO AS FALLIBLE AS PEOPLE
ARE."
AND HE USED THIS EXAMPLE.
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD AN ATTORNEYGENERAL, A LAWYER WHO KNOWS THE
CONSTITUTION, BUT HE WASAMBITIOUS.
HE WANTED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR.
AND HE FOUND THAT THE SINGLEMOST POPULAR ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA
WAS THE GET RID OF THE JAPSISSUE, AND HE RAN ON IT, WON,
BECAME THE GOVERNOR, WASREELECTED AND THEN WAS REELECTED
AGAIN, ONE OF THE FEW GOVERNORSTO SERVE THREE TERMS IN
CALIFORNIA, AND THEN HE WASAPPOINTED TO BE THE CHIEF
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATESSUPREME COURT.
HIS NAME IS EARL WARREN.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> GREAT MAN BUT A FALLIBLEHUMAN BEING.
>> Jon:  IT'S A REMARKABLESTORY.
AND I HESITATE, YOU KNOW...
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT...THERE'S TONS OF JOY AND
FUN AND LAUGHTER IN THEDOCUMENTARY. IT'S GREAT.
>> IT'S ENTERTAINING.
>> Jon: I JUST PERSONALLY WASFASCINATED BY THAT ONE ASPECT OF
IT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCHFOR SHARING THAT.
HE SOUNDS LIKE A REMARKABLE GUY,YOUR DAD.
YOU CAN SEE "TO BE TAKEI," IT'SON DIRECTV THROUGH AUGUST
5TH, SELECT THEATERS ANDITUNES AUGUST 22ND.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: GEORGE TAKEI, EVERYBODY.
