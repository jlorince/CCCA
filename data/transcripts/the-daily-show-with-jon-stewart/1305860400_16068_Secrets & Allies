SO-- NO, THAT'S-- NOW THAT
WE'VE COME OFF THE THOR
LOCOVIAN HIGH THAT WAS OUR
BALLS OUT SEAL TEAM 6 O
IN-- OSAMA BIN LADEN ASSAULT
AND EVILECT OMEE, SOME
TROUBLING QUESTIONS LINGER
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE COUNTRY THAT WE WERE SO
CLOSE WE COULDN'T TELL THEM
WE WERE ABOUT TO INVADE
THEM.
>> HOW COULD BIN LADEN
HIDEOUT FOR SO LONG RIGHT
UNDER THEIR NOSES.
>> Jon: DUPLICITY-- DUPLICITY
OR INCOMPETENCE, WHICH IS
MORE EMBARRASSING THAT OSAMA
BIN LADEN WAS HIDING IF
PLAIN SIGHT IN PAKISTAN OR
THAT THE AMERICANS ENTERED
WITHOUT TELLING THE
PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT?
>> Jon: WOW, THAT'S A ROUGH
TWO OPTIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: PAKISTAN WHAT DOW
HATE MORING HAVING A TINNY
PENIS OR BEING TOO FAT TO
SEE IT.
BOOM, BOOM.
HOW YOU DOING.
BOOM.
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BOOM, NO
DISRESPECT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, PAKISTAN WAS
IN A TRICKY SPOT AS WELL.
PERHAPS NOW UPON REFLECTION,
TIME TO LET BYGONES BE
BYGONES.
>> PAKISTAN HASN'T GIVEN
BACK A SECRET U.S.
HELICOPTER LOST ON THE RAID
IN BIN LADEN'S HOME.
>> THERE IS UNIQUE
TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS ON
THE HELICOPTER THAT THE U.S.
DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO THE
WRONG HANDS.
>> Jon: OH, YES, DON'T HAVE
THAT SECRET TECHNOLOGY IN
THE WRONG HANDS, AKA
PAKISTAN.
NOT THAT THEY DON'T DESERVE
OUR TRUST.
THEY TOOK GREAT CARE OF OUR
VERY SENSITIVE HELICOPTER,
HIDING IT BEHIND WHAT
APPEARS TO BE--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I SWEAR THAT'S A
REAL PICTURE, THEY'RE HIDING
IT BEHIND A ROOM DIVIDER
FROM WESTELL AM.
I MEAN-- IS THE BEST WAY TO
CAMOUFLAGE SECRET MILITARY
TECHNOLOGY THE SAME AS THE
WAY YOU PRETEND YOUR FIRST
APARTMENT HAS A WALL IN IT?
WHAT?
NO, MY BATHROOM'S NOT IN MY
KITCHEN THIS IS A ONE
BEDROOM.
MAGIC.
YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST TEN
YEARS PAKISTAN'S TAKEN LIKE
$20 BILLION OF OUR MONEY,
OSTENSIBLY TO HELP US ALL
WHILE CONTINUING TO BOLSTER
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM,
CONTINUING TO PROVIDE SOME
LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO THE
TALIBAN AND LETTING OUR
NUMBER ONE ENEMY OSAMA BIN
LADEN CRASH IN THEIR GUEST
HOUSE LIKE SOME SORT OF
TURBANNED CATO CAMESCH-- KATO
KAELIN AND NOW HOLDING ON TO
OUR HELICOPTER TAIL.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IS THE
BEST PART OF THE HELICOPTER.
IT'S WHERE THE MEAT IS.
SEND NOW, SEND IN SEAL TIME
ONE.

PREPARING TO TRAVEL TO
PAKISTAN.

UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT GIVEN
MY PROCLIVITY FOR THESE

TWO VOICES I CAN DO.
