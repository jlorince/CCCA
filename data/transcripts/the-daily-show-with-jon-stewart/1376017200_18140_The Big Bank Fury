>> WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
I'M STILL HERE FOR JON
STEWART WHO IS SPENDING THE
SUMMER FULFILLING THE TERMS
OF HIS CRAZY UNCLE'S WILL BY
SPENDING THE WHOLE TIME IN A
HAUNTED HOUSE.
HE DOESN'T LIKE G-G-G
GOSSES.
MY JEST A JUNIOR SENATOR
FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
KIRSTEN GUILT HE BRAND WILL
BE WITH US.
BUT FIRST WE START TONIGHT
WITH MEMORIES.
WHO REMEMBERS WHEN THE WALL
STREET BANKERS TURNED OUR
FINANCIAL SYSTEM INTO A FREE
WILLING CASINO WITH A GLOBAL
CRASH IN WHICH OUR MONEY
DISAPPEARED.
DO YOU REMEMBER?
YEAH, YEAH.
I REMEMBER THAT TOO.
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
THE CHICKENS ARE FINALLY
COMING HOME TO ROOST.
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
ANNOUNCED TODAY IT IS GOING
AFTER BANK OF AMERICA, DOJ
SAYS AMERICA'S SECOND
LARGEST BANK LIED ABOUT THE
RISKINESS OF 850 MILLION
DOLLARS IN SHARES OF HOME
LOANS THAT WERE SOLD TO
INVESTORS.
>> ANOTHER BIG BANK COULD BE
FACING TROUBLE FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
>> JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTS
THAT A PRELIMINARY JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION
FOUND THE BANK DID INDEED
BREAK THE LAW WHILE SELLING
RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BONDS
FROM 2005 TO 2007.
>> YES!
ACCOUNTABILITY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE GOT THEM, BABY!
WHOOO!
>> ACCOUNTABILITY.
>> YES!
YES, SURE, JUSTICE HAS BEEN
A LONG TIME COMING BUT THAT
IS JUST GOING TO MAKE IT ALL
THE SWEETER NOW.
SO LET'S START WITH BANK OF
AMERICA.
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
JAIL?
AND JUST FOR THE SAKE OF
SIMPLICITY ROUND IT UP TO
THE NEAREST 100.
>> THIS IS A CIVIL SUIT SO
NO ONE IS GOING TO JAIL.
(LAUGHTER)
NO ONE, REALLY?
THAT'S-- NOW I'M TO THE
GOING TO BE NEEDING THESE
CELEBRATION DOVES I WAS
GOING TO RELEASE.
(LAUGHTER)
WE DIDN'T DRILL HOLES IN THE
BOX-- HOLD ON, HOLD ON, NO,
THERE'S A NOTE TO.
TO WHOMEVER FINDS US.
I THINK IT WAS A SUICIDE.
THE LACK OF WALL STREET
ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMPLETE
BULL [BLEEP].
WE CAN'T GO ON, LOVE THE
DOVES.
COME ON.
IS THIS-- I'M SORRY, DOVES.
I'M SORRY.
I'M DISAPPOINTED TOO.
IS THIS REALLY ANY SURPRISE,
THOUGH.
EVERY TIME REGULATOR DOES GO
AFTER WALL STREET IT ALWAYS
ENDS THE SAME WAY.
>> PART OF A SETTLEMENT
JPMORGAN DID NOT ADMIT OR
DENY WRONGDOING.
>> CITIBANK DENIES ANY
WRONGDOING BUT SAYS IT WAS
IN THE BANG'S BEST INTEREST
TO SETTLE.
>> UBS DID NOT ADMIT
WRONGDOING.
>> GOLDMAN SACHS SETTLED
EARLY WITHOUT ADMITTING
WRONGDOING.
>> SETTLED.
SO IT SEEMS WALL STREET
REGULATION IS REALLY JUST
LIKE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE
PROCESS.
NO ONE GOES TO JAIL AND IT
ALL ENDS WITH A BUNCH OF
HALF ASSED SETTLEMENTS THAT
SEEM TO MAKE EVERYONE ANGRY.
(APPLAUSE)
>> SO WE MIGHT NOT GET THE
EMOTIONAL CLOSURE OF HAVING
THEM ADMIT WHAT THEY DID OR
THE PHYSICAL CLOSURE OF
HAVING THEM GO TO JAIL SO
HOW ABOUT SOME FINANCIAL
JUSTICE.
CAN WE AT LEAST HIT THEM
WHERE IT HURTS.
>> GOLDMAN SACHS THE GIANT
WALL STREET FIRM HAS AGREED
TO PAY $550 MILLION IN A
SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC.
>> OKAY, THAT'S NOT NOTHING,
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS, I
DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, THAT
HAS GOT TO HURT.
>> 550 MILLION, BY THE WAY,
IS ABOUT THREE DAYS REVENUE
FOR GOLDMAN.
>> THREE DAYS?
A STOMACH FLU LASTS LONGER
THAN THREE DAYS.
IF FEDERAL REGULATORS REALLY
WANTED TO PUNISH THE BANKERS
THEY WOULD HAVE SKIPPED THE
FINE ALL TOGETHER AND JUST
FED THEM SOME OLD SUSHI
INSTEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
ARE WE SOMEHOW SUPPOSED TO
FEEL SATISFIED WITH THIS
KIND OF JUSTICE?
BECAUSE THIS FEELS LIKE, UM,
YEAH, WHAT'S ANOTHER ANALOGY
T FEELS LIKE THE BANKING
EQUIVALENT OF HEY, I DON'T
KNOW WHO GAVE HER THAT BLACK
EYE BUT I'M A NICE GUY SO
HERE'S 20 BUCKS, GO BUY SOME
MAKEUP.
THESE SETTLEMENTS MUST HAVE
FELT LIKE A HOLLOW VICTORY
FOR FEDERAL REGULATORS.
>> TODAY SETTLEMENT IS A
STARK REMINDER, A VERY STARK
REMINDER THAT THERE WILL BE
A HEAVY PRICE TO BE PAID IF
FIRMS VIOLATE THE
PRINCIPLESES FUNDAMENTAL TO
THE SECURITIES LAWS.
>> TODAY'S SETTLEMENT SENDS
A POWERFUL MESSAGE OF
DETERANCE AND ACCOUNT
ABLINGTED.
>> WAIT, YOU SETTLED.
AND NOW YOU'RE BRAGGING
ABOUT IT, SETTLING IS NOT
SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF.
SETTLING IS SOMETHING YOU DO
WHEN YOU BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS
TICKING AND YOU'RE SICK OF
DATING --
>> SURE, SURE, HE'S NOT BRAD
PITT BUT HE HAS A JOB AND MY
