>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST IS DONNIE WAHLBERG GOING TO BE JOINING US LATER ON THE PROGRAM ON THE... LONNIE ANDERSON.
THAT'S THE WOMAN I WOULD BE.
( APPLAUSE ) IF YOU CAN BE ANY ANIMAL, IF YOU CAN BE ANY WOMAN BUT NOBODY EVER
ASKED ME ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH YOU?
(LAUGHING) A LITTLE BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING.
LAST WEEK WE DID A VERY CLEVER BIT ON OUR PROGRAM CALLED 19th CENTURY NEWS.
WITHIN THE BIT WE HAD VERY WITTY FUN CONCERNING MISSISSIPPI'S JUST RECENTLY RATIFYING THE
13th AMENDMENT.
AGREEING TO END SLAVERY, A MERE 148 YEARS AFTER.
AFTER THE REST OF US.
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, IF I AM BRINGING UP SOMETHING THAT WE DID ON THE SHOW LAST WEEK, I'M
PROBABLY ABOUT TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT.
MAYBE I'M APOLOGIZING TO MISSISSIPPI AS PAINTING IT TO SOME KIND OF RELUCTANT ENTRANT
TO MODERN MORALITY.
YES, NO.
IT CONCERNS A FORMER MISSISSIPPI SECRETARY OF STATE WHO PRESIDED OVER A 1995 ATTEMPT TO RATIFY
THE 13th AMENDMENT.
IT FAILED DUE TO A BUREAUCRATIC SNAFU
>> THEIR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE FAILED TO SEND A COPY OF THE RESOLUTION TO THE FEDERAL REGISTRAR.
>> Jon: CLASSIC.
HERE'S MY IMPRESSION OF HIM MAILING MISSISSIPPI'S 13th AMENDMENT RATIFICATION TO THE
FEDERAL REGISTRAR.
"SO GLAD WE DID THIS.
THAT'S REALLY NICE.
LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN THE MAILBOX." OH, WHAT FUN!
LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT WE DID JUST THERE.
WE USED THE GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF DICK MOLFUSS LARGELY BECAUSE HIS NAME WAS DICK
MOLFUSS AS AN AVITAR FOR CASUAL BIGOTRY FORGETTING THAT PERHAPS DICK MOLFUSS IS A REAL PERSON
WITH A REAL RECORD ON CIVIL RIGHTS.
YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF, COULDN'T YOU JUST LOOK THAT UP?
YEAH, WE COULD HAVE.
OR, OR WE COULD HAVE REMAINED SMUGLY SATISFIED WITH THE FUNNY NAME.
WE WENT WITH B MAINLY BECAUSE I AM A MADE 12-YEAR-OLD BOY TRAPPED IN A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN'S BODY.
SO AS IT TURNS OUT DICK MOLFUSS -- DON'T GET TICKLED BY THE NAME, JOHNNY BOY -- IT TURNS
OUT DICK MOLFUSS HAS A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED RECORD OF SPEAKING OUT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN MISSISSIPPI.
HE'S AN HONORABLE AND GOOD MAN.
WHO IN THE '90s LED THE CHARGE ON BIG VOTING RIGHTS REFORMS THERE.
IN 1989 HE SPOKE AT A 25th ANNIVERSARY MEMORIAL FOR THE THREE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS
MURDERED OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA MISSISSIPPI DURING THE SUMMER, A SPEECH THAT EARNED MR. MOLPUS
DEATH THREATS.
APPARENTLY BITTER RACISTS LIVE LONGER THAN YOU WOULD THINK.
ANYWAY, WE FOUND OUT ALL THIS, I'D SAY, ABOUT A HALF HOUR AFTER IT AIRED ON A THURSDAY NIGHT I
MIGHT ADD.
NOT THE BEST NIGHT FOR US TO MAKE A MISTAKE.
SINCERE APOLOGIES TO MR. MOLPUS.
HE DID NOT ASK US FOR APOLOGIZE.
NO ONE CONTACTED US TO COMPLAIN.
MY GUESS IS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE ALIVE AND ARE PROBABLY TOO BUSY TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THIS WORLD, TO CARE.
WE APOLOGIZE BECAUSE, WELL, WE LIKE TO BELIEVE THERE'S STILL A LITTLE DICK MOLPUS IN ALL OF US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THAT EVEN ELITIST PRICKS LIKE ME CAN SOMETIMES STILL PICK
UP THAT 3:00 A.M. CONSCIENCE WAKE-UP CALL AND
