TO ADD, MOTHER [BLEEPED].
ROMNEY WAS SHARP AND DREW BLOOD.
>> HE SAID THAT BY NOW WE'D HAVE
UNEMPLOYMENT AT 5.4%.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE IT
IS AND 5.4% IS MILLION AMERICANS
WORK, 9 MILLION.
>> Jon: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE
A MARK.
BUT FOR EVERY POINT ROMNEY MADE,
THE PRESIDENT MADE MORE.
>> ROMNEY WAS FOR A ASSAULT
WEAPONS BAN BEFORE HE WAS
AGAINST IT.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY DOESN'T HAVE A
FIVE-POINT PLAN.
HE HAS A ONE-POINT PLAN.
MY PENSION ISN'T AS BIG AS
YOURS.
GOVERNOR, YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
WHO IS GOING TO GET TOUGH ON
CHINA.
>> THE LAST PERSON WHO IS GOING
TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA IS THAT
GUY, ROMNEY.
FOR GOD SAKE, ROMNEY WAS
ASSEMBLED AT A FACTORY IN
BEIJING.
THAT'S WHY HE'S SO WELL
DESIGNED.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ROMNEY ALSO... ROMNEY HAD SOME
OTHER ISSUES.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON SHOULD
TELL SOMEONE WHETHER THEY CAN
USE CONTRACEPTIVES OR NOT.
>> YEAH, YOU SHOULD TELL THAT TO
YOUR DISEMBODIED VOICE THAT
SUPPORTED THE BLUNT MENTAL WHICH
DOES LIMIT CHOICE.
>> OF COURSE I SUPPORT THE BLUNT
AMENDMENT.
SOME STATE LAW.
I TALKED ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVES.
I MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION.
>> FOR THOSE OF YOU IN YOUR DORM
ROOMS CARVING AN APPLE WHOSE
EARS MAY HAVE PERKED UP AT THE
MENTION OF A BLUNT AMENDMENT, IT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
LAUGH LAUGHTER AND ROMNEY HAD
SOME ODD MOMENT, LIKE WHEN
DESCRIBING HIS EFFORTs AS
GOVERNOR TO RECRUIT MORE WOMEN
FOR CABINET POSITIONS.
>> I WENT TO A NUMBER OF WOMEN'S
GROUPS AND SAID, CAN YOU HELP US
FIND GROUPS.
THEY BROUGHT US BINDERS FULL OF
WOMEN.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: A COUPLE THINGS.
[LAUGHTER]
ONE, THE WOMEN'S GROUP WAS
CALLED MASCAP, AN THEY
APPROACHED GOVERNOR ROMNEY, NOT
OTHER WAY AROUND, AND, TWO, MY
GUESS IS THEY DID NOT REFER TO
WHAT THEY PRESENTED AS "WHOLE
BINDERS FULL OF WOMEN."
[LAUGHTER]
BUT PERHAPS REFERRED TO IT AS A
WELL-ORGANIZED COLLECTION OF
QUALIFIED RESUMES.
BUT HEY, BINDER OF WOMEN, BOOK
OF BROADS,
