YOU TONIGHT.
WE HAVE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN.

OUR GUEST TONIGHT, HOWARD
WASDIN, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK
ABOUT SEAL TEAM 6 AND WINNER
OF THIS YEAR'S INCREDIBLY
WELL TIMED BOOK RELEASE
PRIZE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: TO TURN TO A MORE
SERIOUS TOPIC, FOR THE PAST
TWO WEEKS THE NEWS HAS BEEN
DOMINATED BY SCANDAL OF A
PARTICULARLY PUR YENT
NATURE.
-- PURE YENT NATURE.
I FOR ONE BELIEVE THAT IT'S
TIME THAT WE LIFT OUR GAZE
FROM THE GOSSIP FILLED
GUTTER.
THE REAL CHALLENGE FOR NEWT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE REAL CHALLENGE
FOR A NEWS PROGRAM SUCH AS
OURS IS NOT HOW BEST TO
INDULGE OUR MOST BASE AND
CALLOW INSTINCTS BUT HOW
BEST TO CHOOSE WHICH
IMPORTANT BUT NOW OVERLOOKED
STORY OF IMPORTANCE TO DO
FIRST.
SIMPLE.
A LITTLE EDITORIAL AUTHORITY,
WITH THE HELP OF OUR FRIEND,
A GIANT--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GIANT-- OUGHT TO DO IT.
NOW I GIVE YOU NOW THE DAILY
SHOW [BLEEP] BLOCKED STORIES
ROUNDUP.
THESE ARE OUR STORIES.
NOW THESE ARE ALL STORIES
THAT HAVE BEEN [BLEEP]
BLOCKED BY THIS RECENT
SCANDAL.
BY THE WAY, LES YOU THINK ME
CRASS, THIS IS THE EXACT
RUBBER PENIS WHEEL EDWARD R.
MURROW USED.
(LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW
THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
KNEW THIS.
MURROW'S ORIGINAL SIGNOFF
PHRASE WAS GOOD NIGHT AND
GOOD LICK-- LUCK [BLEEP]
WHAT?
WE ACTUALLY GOT THIS FROM
THE RADIO OF MUSEUM, AND
TELEVISION AND DILDO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHILE THIS IS ON
LOAN THE MUSEUM IS CLOSED.
IT WAS REALLY THEIR ONLY
EXHIBIT.
SO ANY WAY--
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LET'S GIVE HIM A
SPIN.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, OH, OH, NO JRZ IT'S
GOING TO BE-- OH, OUR THREE
WARS, WELL, A WORTHY START
SO I'M SORRY, A WORTHY START
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING.
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, LIBYA.
>> THE UNITED STATES
REPORTEDLY RAMPING UP AIR
STRIKES AGAINST AL QAEDA IN
YEMEN.
>> WAIT, WE'RE BOMBING YEMEN
NOW TOO?
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS THE
PRESIDENT'S NEW BANNER.
>> OH.
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN SECRETLY
HITTING TERROR COMPOUNDS IN
YEMEN WITH THE COOPERATION
OF THEIR PRESIDENT SALEH.
HOW'S HE DOING?
>> A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL
SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAD
SHRAPNEL WOUNDS AND SEVERE
BURNS TO HIS FACE AND CHEST
FROM AN ATTACK ON THE
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE FRIDAY.
THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS HE'LL
RETURN AFTER UNDERGOING
TREATMENT IN SAUDI ARABIA.
>> Jon: REALLY?
HE'S COMING BACK.
I SEE YEMEN'S PRESIDENT
SALEH FEELS THE YEMENI
INSURGENTS WHO LAUNCHED A
MORTAR ATTACK ON HIM WHILE
HE WAS PRAYING WAS A
TEMPORARY SETBACK.
BUT HE STILLS HAS THE
PEOPLE'S SUPPORT ALTHOUGH IF
YOU LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF
THE LATEST PRESIDENTIAL
POPULARITY POLL IN YEMEN, I
BELIEVE THAT'S YEMEN FOR
STRONGLY DISAPPROVE.
BUT IT'S INTERESTING SALEH
STILL WINS
