[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]>> Jon: WELCOME TO
"THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE.
WE GOT A GOOD ONE.
WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MY MANCRUSH...
[LAUGHTER]MR. HUGH JACKMAN WILL BE JOINING
US.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT, THOUGH,WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM
EXCITEMENT TO NOT AS MUCH.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OURSADLY RECURRING SEGMENT,
DEPRESSINGLY FAMILIARPOST-TRAGEDY
ANALYSIS. SO, THE GUY WHOKILLED ALL THOSE PEOPLEMONDAY WITH A SHOTGUN HE
LEGALLY PURCHASED TWO DAYSBEFORE THAT, WARNING SIGNS?
>> ALEXIS' FAMILY HAS TOLDINVESTIGATORS HE SUFFERED FROM
MENTAL ILLNESS FOR A DECADE.
>> Jon: A DECADE OF MENTALILLNESS.
THAT'S PECULIAR.
WOULDN'T THERE BE A PAPER TRAILFOR TEN YEARS OF PSYCHIATRIC
ISSUES.
>> HE SOUGHT AND RECEIVEDTREATMENT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT
OF VETERANS' AFFAIRS.
>>>> Jon: OH.
[LAUGHTER]SO THE V.A.
LOTS OF PAPER, NOT A LOT OFTRAIL.
WELL, AT LEAST THE SHOOTER HADNO LEGAL ISSUES THAT MIGHT
PRECLUDE HIM FROM GUN OWNERSHIP.
>> TWICE HE WAS ARRESTED INMINOR SHOOTING INCIDENTS, IN
SEATTLE UNTIL 2004 AND IN TEXASIN
2010.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, IF I WANTEDTO PICK OUT ONE THING THAT BEST
EXEMPLIFIES OUR COUNTRY'SPECULIAR
RELATIONSHIP WITH GUNS, IT MIGHTBE THAT THE PHRASE "MINOR
SHOOTING INCIDENT" EXISTS.
IT WAS JUST A COUPLE BULLETS,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I HAD TO TURN THE TV OFF AND IDIDN'T WANT TO GET UP AND GET
THE REMOTE SO... WHAT EXACTLYCONSTITUTES A MINOR SHOOTING
INCIDENT?
>> SHOOTING IN AN APARTMENT,HARASSING A COWORKER BY SHOOTING
OUT HIS TIRES.
>> Jon: SHOOTING SOMEONE'STIRES OUT IS NOT HARASSMENT.
HARASSMENT OF A CONSTRUCTIONWORKER, IS HEY, THAT'S A NICE
HARD HAT, DOES IT COME IN MEN'SCOLORS.
THAT'S HARASSMENT.
>> THE TEXAS SHOOTING CASE LEDTO ALEXIS' DISCHARGE FROM THE
NAVY RESERVES.
>> .
>> Jon: OH, WELL THEN I GUESSTHE NAVY AS PER STANDARD
PROCEDURE HAD THOSE RECORDSMULCHED AND FED TO HUNGRY
DOLPHINS WHERE THE RECORDS WEREPOOPED ON TO THE OCEAN FLOOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ALL IN THEPAST.
THAT'S THE PAST.
THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING WITHINTHE PAST MONTH THAT WOULD HAVE
GIVEN PAUSE TO THE SHOT GUNBACKGROUND CHECKERS.
>> JUST LAST MONTH THERE WAS ANINCIDENT IN NEWPORT, RHODE
ISLAND.
ALEXIS CALLED POLICE THERE ONAUGUST 7th TO SAY HE WAS
HEARING VOICES AND THAT PEOPLEWERE STALKING HIM AND USING A
MICROWAVE TO SEND VIBRATIONSINTO HIS BODY.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THIS IS WHY I USE A
HIBACHI.
[LAUGHTER]BECAUSE WHEN IT TELLS ME TO KILL
PEOPLE, IT SPEAKS IN A LANGUAGEI DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SO IF ONLY ALL OUR LAWENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS HAD BEEN
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONEANOTHER AND SHARE ALL THIS VERY
PERTINENT INFORMATION, AREASONABLE PERSON MIGHT CONCLUDE
THESHOOTER NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
HIS HANDS ON THAT SHOTGUN.
UNLESS THAT REASONABLE PERSON ISFAMILIAR WITH OUR NATION'S
BACKGROUND GUN CHECK LAWS.
>> UNDER THE GUN CONTROL ACT,THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT
PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASINGFIREARMS.
HE WASN'T A CONVICTED FELON.
HE WAS NOT AN ILLEGAL ALIEN.
HE WAS NOT DISHONORABLYDISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY,
NOR WAS HE FOUND MENTALLYDEFECTIVE BY A COURT, SO
THEREFORE HE WAS ABLE TO GO INTOA GUN STORE AND BUY A GUN.
>> Jon: GET IT.
EVEN IF THE GUN STORE OWNER WASAWARE THAT THIS GUY HEARD VOICES
AND HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON GUNCHARGES THAT HAD GOTTEN HIM
DISCHARGED FROM THE NAVYRESERVES, THAT MAN STILL WOULD
HAVE PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECKWITH FLYING CRAZY.
