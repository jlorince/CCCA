>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE HOST OFMSNBC'S RACHEL MADDOW SHOW
HER NEW DOCUMENTARY FOR MSNBC ISCALLED
"WHY WE DID IT."
THE GENERAL SELECTED BY THEPENTAGON TO STABILIZE THE
SITUATION AND QUICKLY TURN OVERPOWER TO THE IRAQIS FINDS THAT
HIS MISSION HAS CHANGED.
>> I DID NOT WANT TO SLIP FROMLIBERATION TO OCCUPATION.
I THOUGHT IT'S THE WORST THINGTO DO.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS FROMRUMSFELD TO THE WHITE HOUSE FROM
EVERYWHERE THAT WE WERE GOING TOGO IN THERE AND SET UP AN
INTERIM GOVERNMENT ASRAPID AS WE COULD.
WHEN THE AMBASSADOR BREMER CAMEOVER THAT DIRECTION HAD CHANGED.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TOTHE PROGRAM RACHEL MADDOW.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HOW ARE YOU?
>> HI, I'M GREAT.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: I HAVE TO GLUE THATDOWN.
SO THERE'S A -- YOU'VE DONE THISA DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHY WE WENT
TO WAR IN IRAQ.
THERE'S A SAYING, "THOSE WHOFORGET -- NO "THOSE WHO REVISIT
HISTORY WILL GET SAD."
[LAUGHTER]WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?
WHY DID YOU DELVE BACK INTOTHE
MORASS, THE ABYSS THAT IS THEIRAQ WAR?
>> IT IS HISTORY BUT I FEEL LIKEIT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT
UNANSWERED QUESTION IN THEMODERN HISTORY WHICH IS WHY WE
WENT TO THAT WAR.
I DID A DOCUMENTARY A LITTLEMORE THAN A YEAR AGO ABOUT HOW
WE WERE LIED TO, ABOUT HOW THEADMINISTRATION'S CASE ABOUT WHY
WE HAD TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQWASN'T TRUE AND THEY SOLD US A
FALSE CASE?
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> IT LEADS RIGHT AWAY TO THENEXT QUESTION:  IF THE CASE
WASN'T REALLY WHY THEY WANTED TOGO, WHY DID THEY REALLY WANT TO
GO?
TWO MILLION AMERICANS SERVEDTHERE AND 4,000 AMERICANS DIED
THERE. WE OWE IT TOTHEM IF NOTHING ELSE TO
KNOW WHERE THEY SERVED THERE ANDTHAT HASN'T BEEN ANSWERED YET.
AND NOW THAT IT'S TEN YEARS ONTHERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT
WOULDN'T TALK BEFORE WHO NOWWILL TALK ABOUT THEIR ROLE IN
IT AND A BUNCH OF DOCUMENTS WECOULDN'T GET OUR HANDS ON
BEFORETHAT WE NOW HAVE.
>> Jon: WHAT IS IT ABOUT THATTEN YEAR PERIOD? I WOULD THINK
THAT TEN YEARS IS STILLRECENT ENOUGH THAT THESE
INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLYLIKE -- YOU IMAGINESOMEBODY WRITING A
LETTER AND GOING "WHEN I DIEWAIT 25 YEARS TO OPEN THIS."
IT'S INTERESTING THEY WOULD PUTTHEMSELVES OUT THERE FOR IT.
>> YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN WESTARTED THE DOCUMENTARY IF WE
WOULD BE BASING IT ON DOCUMENTSAND NOBODY WOULD TALK TO US.
BUT IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE AREWILLING TO TALK TO US.
THERE'S SORT OF UNLIKELY HEROES,SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN
HIGH PROFILE FOLKS THAT WERESENT TO IRAQ AND
BELIEVED THE PUBLIC CASEAND REALIZED OH THAT IS NOT WHY
WE'RE HERE AND HAVE BEENCARRYING THAT EVER SINCE.
>> Jon: WOULD ZINNI BE ONE OFTHOSE CHARACTERS?
>> IN A WAY, YEAH.
I THINK ANYBODY WITH POLITICALASPIRATIONS KNOWS THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO COME TO FRUITIONTHROUGH BEING VETERANS OF
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEREPUBLICAN PARTY WORKED OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]MAYBE THAT FANTASY IS EXPIRED.
>> Jon: ARE THEY FEELING -- ISTHERE A BITTERNESS THERE AMONGST
THOSE THAT WERE QUOTE UNQUOTEGOOD SOLDIERS THAT FEEL LEFT
BEHIND?
>> THERE'S A DESIRE, I THINK, TOHEAR THE TRUTH TOLD
THERE ARE TWO MILLION IRAQ WARVETERANS IN THIS COUNTRY AND
4,000 FAMILIES WHO LOSTSOMEBODY. AND WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK ATWOUNDED WARRIORS, YOU LOOK AT
THE PEOPLE WHO ARECARRYING THIS WITH THEM
THE REST OF THEIR LIVESI THINK PEOPLE WHO WERE
PART OF IT IN SOME WAYSWANT TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE AND
HEAR THE TRUTH.
IT HAS NEVER BEEN EXPLAINED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: THE QUESTION I HAVE IS
THERE'S BEEN AN UNDERCURRENT OFTHIS FOR TEN YEARS DOES IT NEED
BE RELENTLESSLY TOLD OVER ANDOVER AGAIN?
WHO OWNS THE HISTORY OF THIS ANDHOW DOES THAT SHAPE OUR
PERCEPTION OF THIS AND HOW HAVETHEY TRIED TO SHAPE IT IN A
MANNER THAT IS MUCH MOREPOSITIVE TO THEIR PERSPECTIVE?
>> I THINK THE MOST INSIDIOUSWAY THEY'VE TRIED TO SHAPE IS TO
SAY LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THISANYMORE.
I KNOW WE NEVER ANSWERED THATQUESTION BUT LET'S LET IT GO.
THE IRAQ WAR LOOMS VERY LARGEOVER THE DECISIONS WE MAKE NOW
OVER NATIONAL SECURITY.
NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO WARAGAINST RUSSIA OVER THIS CRIMEA
THING.
>> Jon: I'VE BEEN WATCHING THENEWS.
>> WE ARE ALL UKRAINIANS NOWACCORDING TO SENATOR McCAIN.
>> Jon: IT'S INCREDIBLE, TOO,HOW QUICKLY THEY JUMP.
WE LISTEN TO ALL THESEINDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SO WRONG,
LED US SO AWRY IN THE IRAQ WARAND THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY ON
TELEVISION WITH GREATCONFIDENCE.
WE'RE SO NAIVE.
IT'S BEEN 48 HOURS ATTACK!
THE HUBRIS IS INCREDIBLE.
>> YEAH.
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE HADN'TBEEN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONG THE FIRSTTIME.
THE PEOPLE WHO SAID WE OUGHT TOGO. IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE MANY
PEOPLE. IT'S GOINGTO PAY FOR IT IS. IT DOESN'T
MATTER THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA SETUP A GOVERNMENT. IRAQ
IT WILL BE A JEFFERSONIANDEMOCRACY IN THE HEART OF MIDDLE
EAST.
THOSE GUYS -- PAUL WOLFOWITZ GOTTO GO RUN THE WORLD BANK?
REALLY? YOU SHOULDN'T BE RUNNINGA LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM IN A SMALL
TOWN IN A COUNTRY OTHER THANTHIS ONE THAT WE DISLIKE.
[LAUGHTER]YOU CAN'T HAVE CREDIBILITY ON
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES YOUCAN'T BE BILL KRISTOL WHO'S
BANGING THE DRUMS HARDER THANANYONE ELSE THAT WE OUGHT TO GO
TO IRAQ AND NOW BANGING THEDRUMS FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT WAR.
SHAME ON US FOR EVEN ASKINGTHEIR OPINION.
>> Jon: IT SHOCKS ME --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- WHEN YOU GO, YOU KNOW, WE'VEGOT DICK CHENEY ON THE LINE.
THESE GUYS DON'T UNDERSTANDWHAT -- ON THE THING -- YOU JUST
WANT SOMEBODY TO SAY YOU'VE BEENWRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I ALWAYS SAY THIS TO PEOPLEIMAGINE GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY
FOR EIGHT YEARS AND BEING WRONGAND TOWARDS THE END OF THAT TIME
SHOOTING AN OLD MAN IN THE FACEAND STILL PEOPLE ASK YOUR
OPINION ABOUT THINGS.
>> PEOPLE ASK YOUR OPINIONSPECIFICALLY ABOUT EXECUTIVE
POWER AND USE OF FORCE AND LYINGTO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT'S TOUGH.
I FEEL LIKE THE REASON IRAQLOOMS OVER WHAT WE DO IS IT'S
THE ORIGINAL SIN OF 21ST CENTURYAND  UNTIL WE RECKON HONESTLYWITH
WHY WE DID IT, WE'RE GOING --NEVER GOING TO ESCAPE IT AND WE
OWE IT TO OURSELVES TO GET PASTIT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I APPRECIATE IT VERYMUCH. I CANNOT WAIT, I SAY
THIS IN ALL SINCERITY.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEDOCUMENTARIES ABOUT WHY WE WENT
TO WAR WITH RUSSIA AND IRAN. ITHINK THOSE WILL BE GREAT
DOCUMENTARIES AS WELL.
WHY WE DID IT. PREMIERES ONMSNBC MARCH 6, 9:00 P.M.
RACHEL MADDOW.
THANK YOU.
