(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE
WAS THE FIRST CHIEF TECHNOLOGYOFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT, A POST HE HELD FROM2009 TO 2012.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED"INNOVATIVE STATE:  HOW NEW
TECHNOLOGIES CAN TRANSFORMGOVERNMENT."
PLEASE WELCOME ANEESH CHOPRA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT.
EXCITING!
>> Jon: INDIAN CLOONEY!
WAS I WRONG?
NO, "INNOVATIVE STATE:  HOW NEWTECHNOLOGIES CAN TRANSFORM
GOVERNMENT" I GUESS MY QUESTIONWOULD BE WHY HAVEN'T THEY?
WHAT'S TAKING NEW TECHNOLOGY SOLONG?
IS GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY IMMUNETO SOME EXTENT?
>> WELL, LET'S PUT OURSELVES INSOME HISTORICAL CONTEXT, JON.
>> Jon: YOU AND I?
>> YES, SIR!
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> IF YOU LOOK BACK THROUGHOUTHISTORY WE'VE HAD LONG PERIODS
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HASACTUALLY LED THE PRIVATE SECTOR
IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGIES.IN FACT, ONE OF THE FOUNDING
TECHNOLOGIES FOR I.B.M.HAD ITS ORIGINS IN A CENSUS
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE. AND YOU SEETHAT --
>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
>> YES, SIR, DID YOU KNOW THAT?
THE 1870 CENSUS.
>> Jon: SURE, I KNEW THAT.
>> YES, SIR.
>> Jon: SO WHY DID IT FALLBEHIND?
>> IF YOU TAKE THE LONG VIEW, WEHAVE BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE,
IT'S THE LAST 20 YEARS WHERE THEPACE OF INNOVATION AND THE
PRIVATE SECTOR, CLOUD COMPUTING,BIG DATA, MOBILE BROADBAND,
THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEENHARDER TO INGEST INTO THE
GOVERNMENT LARGELY BECAUSE WE'VEHAD A DIFFICULT PROCESS TO
BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN.
WE WALKED INTO THE DOOR OF THEWHITE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, I
STILL HAD MY OLD INTERNETEXPLORER 6 ON THE COMPUTER.
>> Jon: YOU WERE USING 6!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
>> WE HAVE TO BRING NEWTECHNOLOGY IN.
IT WAS THE BUGGY VERSION.
>> Jon: IN THE THREE YEARS YOUWERE THERE, IT'S HARD TO
RECONCILE, I THINK, FOR ME, ASADVANCED AS THE THE OBAMA
CAMPAIGN WAS WITH THEIRTECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF GETTING
REELECTED, WHY THEY HAD SO MUCHDIFFICULTY.
LET'S USE THE V.A. AS ANEXAMPLE.
>> SURE.
>> Jon: THEY'VE KNOWN FORYEARS THAT THE SYSTEM THERE IS
ANTIQUATED.
WE CLEARLY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGYTO UPDATE IT AND MAKE IT WORK
MORE EFFICIENTLY.
WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN ABLE TO?
CLEARLY, THEY THREW A LOT OFRESOURCES AT healthcare.gov
ONCE THEY REALIZEDTHAT WAS WONKY.
WHY CAN'T THEY THROW EVERYTHINGAT THE V.A.?
>> LET ME BEGIN WITHSOME PERSONAL CONTEXT.
I WAS IN THE CABINET INVIRGINIA
BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO COME TOWASHINGTON.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> I HAD A COLLEAGUE IN THECABINET WHOSE SON HAD BEEN
ATTACKED BY A MISSILE IN BAGHDADAND SHE SHARED WITH ME THE
CHALLENGES AS HER SON CAME BACKTO HEALTH OF THE RECORDS SHE HAD
ON PAPER AND HIS FAMILY HAD TOTRUCK AROUND BETWEEN THE
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.
SO WE CAME IN AND MADE IT ACLEAR PRIORITY TO DIGITIZE AND
OPEN UP SOME OF THOSE RECORDS.
SO NOW, TODAY, OVER A MILLIONVETERANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
DOWNLOAD SAFELY AND SECURELYELECTRONIC COPIES OF THE SAME
RECORDS.
SO WE'VE MODERNIZED A NUMBER OFTHE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN
PLACE.
>> Jon: 90% OF THESE GUYS ARESTILL WORKING ON PAPER RECORDS.
>> ACTUALLY, THE CLAIMS BACKLOGWHICH IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT QUITE A BIT.
>> Jon: DOWN TO 300,000.
>> WE ACTUALLY HAD A CENTER INVIRGINIA WHERE THE FIRE MARSHAL
HAD TO BADICALLY DECLARE THEBUILDING LIKE UNINHABITABLE
BECAUSE OF THE PAPER. WE NOWHAVE THOSE CENTERS
SCANNED OUT, ELECTRONIC FORMSHAVE COME IN
AND THE BACKLOG IS DOWN 50%BECAUSE WE'VE PUT IN A LOT OF
FOCUS AND ATTENTION.
WHEN WE LEARN OF PROBLEMS --PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THETHEM AND FIX THEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
HERE'S THE THING...
(LAUGHTER)WE KNEW THE PROBLEMS GOING IN IN
2007, AND IT'S 2014.
AND IT'S HARD TO -- AND,LISTEN --
>> I HEAR YOU.
>> Jon: -- IT'S NOT AN ATTACKON THE GOOD-HEARTED PEOPLE WHO
HAVE TRIED TO WORK TO FIX IT,BUT IT IS HARD TO SWALLOW THE
IDEA THAT, HEY, WE'VE CUT IT 50%IN SEVEN YEARS, YOU KNOW.
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, ISTHERE SOMETHING WITHIN THE
PROCESS?
YOU'RE A GUY WHO UNDERSTANDSTHIS TECHNOLOGY.
>> YES.
>> Jon: MY GUESS IS YOU COULDDESIGN A SYSTEM THAT COULD BE
IMPLEMENTED FAR MORE CHEAPLYTHAN THE BILLION DOLLARS THEY
SPENT TO CREATE THE TWO PROGRAMSAT D.O.D. AND V.A. THAT DON'T
EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER, YOUCOULD DO IT FOR MUCH LESS AND
MUCH FASTER.
WHY CAN'T THEY?
>> LET ME BE CAREFUL.IN THE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE
SYSTEM WRIT LARGE THE ABILITYFOR TWO NON-CONNECTED
SYSTEMS TO TALK TO EACHOTHER IS STILL  A PROBLEM.
BECAUSE THE DATABASES WHEN THEYWERE BUILT JUST FOR THEIR
PRIMARY USE, THE ABILITY TO TAKEINFORMATION AND SHARE IT WITH
OTHERS WAS NOT PART OF THEORIGINAL DESIGN.
SO AFTER THE FACT, IF YOU TRY TOSTITCH THESE THINGS TOGETHER,
YOU DON'T WANT TO INTRODUCEERROR.
YOU DON'T WANT TO STITCH THEMTOGETHER BY BRUTE FORCE AND SAY,
HEY, IS THIS WORKING AND RUN THERISK YOU HAVE THE WRONG
MEDICATION FOR THE PATIENT ANDISSUED THE WRONG DOSE.
THAT'S INTRODUCINGHARM. SO, THE REASON WHY I SAID
EMPOWER THEM DIRECTLY,THE SYSTEMS WHO HAVE THE
DATA CAN GIVE IT TO YOU.
>> Jon: WHO'S GOT THE DATA?
>> EACH INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM, THEDoD HAS ITS DATA, THE V.A. HAS
ITS DATA. IN THE PRIVATE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THEY HAVE THEIR
DATA. I HEAR YOU.YOU DON'T WANT THE
VETERAN OF HAVING TO GOTHROUGH THE WORK.
>> Jon: THEY'RE ALREADY DOINGIT.
>> IT IS SAFE, SECURE, AND THEIRFAMILIES -- I WOULD RATHER MY
COLLEAGUE -->> Jon: YOU WOULD RECOMMEND
NOT HAVING A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM?
>> THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONGTIME. LOTS OF MONEY.
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK THROUGHTHAT PROCESS.
>> Jon: WHY IS THAT?
I GUESS, THAT'S MY POINT.
WHY IS THAT GOING TO TAKE SOLONG?
>> YOU HAVE A LEGACY DATABASEYOU WILL HAVE TO MODERNIZE.
MANY OF THESE INITIAL SYSTEMSWEREN'T BUILT WITH THESE MODERN
APPROCHES. NOT A GOVERNMENTSYSTEM,
EVERY SYSTEM IN THE UNITEDSTATES, PUBLIC SECTOR,
PRIVATE SECTOR. SO,WHAT I WANT TO DO IS
EMPOWER PEOPLE TO LIVEBETTER LIVES AND ALLOW THEM TO
LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE BETTER THAN AN INDIANCLOONEY.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN CLOONEY!
INNOVATIVE STATE IS ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
OBVIOUSLY, THE INTERVIEW THAT WEDID IS VERY LONG.
SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONLY SEENA FEW MINUTES OF IT AND
ARE THINKING, THAT DIDN'T MAKEANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.
IF YOU GO TO THE WEB, NOW -- AREYOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WEB?
>> I THINK SO.
AN INNOVATION FROMGOVERNMENT, I MIGHT ADD.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT IS TRUE, I'LL
GIVE YOU THAT.
"INNOVATIVE STATE:  HOW NEWTECHNOLOGIES CAN TRANSFORM
GOVERNMENT."
GO TO THE WEB!
ANEESH CHOPRA!
