>> Jon: WELCOME!
-- WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WEHAVE PUT TOGETHER TONIGHT.
TONIGHT WE HAVE WITH US THEMAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND,
MR. BILLY CRYSTAL IS GOINGTO BE JOINING US TONIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)FUNNY MAN, FUNNY MAN!
WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO THEINTERNATIONAL SITUATION.
FOR YEARS NOW SYRIA HASINSISTED THAT NOT ONLY HAS
IT NOT USED CHEMICALWEAPONS--
(LAUGHTER)-- WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?
(LAUGHTER)SO AFTER A RECENT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS INCIDENT IN SYRIATHE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO
SEE IF WE COULD BOMB THETRUTH OUT OF THEM.
(LAUGHTER)SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY TO THE
MUNITIONS DEPOT THE PLAN HITA SNAG.
RUSSIA SUGGESTED THATPERHAPS IF SYRIA WERE TO
GIVE UP THE CHEMICAL WEAPONSIT DOES NOT HAVE, AND
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT.
>> THE U.N. HAS CONFIRMED TOUS THAT THE SYRIAN MISSION
HERE HAS SENT TO THEM ALETTER IN WHICH THEY ASK TO
ACCEDE TO JOIN THE CHEMICALWEAPONS CONVENTION OF 1993.
THE TERMS OF THAT BASICALLYSAY A COUNTRY HAS TO GET RID
OF ALL ITS STOCKPILES OFCHEMICAL WEAPONS.
>> Jon: OH, OH, YOU SAIDSARIN -- SARIN GAS, OH, YEAH,
WE HAVE THAT.
(LAUGHTER)WE THOUGHT YOU SAID GIVE UP
YOUR STOCKPILES OF SARANWRAP.
(LAUGHTER)WE DON'T HAVE THAT, WE'RE A
TUPPERWARE PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)NOW WHILE THIS DEVELOPMENT
PUTS A CRIMP IN WHAT HASBEEN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S PUSH TORALLY THE NATION BEHIND ONE
OF THOSE NOT WARS WE LIKE TOENGAGE IN FROM TIME TO
TIME-- (LAUGHTER)
THE PRESIDENT STILL ONTUESDAY NIGHT INTERRUPTED
THE PRIME TIME SCHEDULES OFEVERY MAJOR TELEVISION
NETWORK TO WALK DOWN IKILLED BIN LADEN LANE--
(LAUGHTER)AND MAKE THE CASE FOR
AMERICAN INTERVENTION INSYRIA!
BECAUSE GOING AHEAD ANDMAKING THE SPEECH EVEN AFTER
THE RUSSIANS MADE THAT OFFER,AND THE SYRIANS ACCEPTED IT,
WAS THE BEST THING TO DO.
NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD PUT ADEPOSIT DOWN ON THAT TIME--
(LAUGHTER)BEFORE MOMENTUM SWUNG TO A
MORE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION.
AND APPARENTLY THEY CAN'TGET THEIR MONEY BACK.
(LAUGHTER)THE HEART OF THE PRESIDENT'S
ARGUMENT WAS SIMPLE.
>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS, FORNEARLY SEVEN DECADES THE
UNITEDSTATES HAS BEEN THE ANCHOR
OF GLOBAL SECURITY THIS HASMEANT DOING MORE THAN
FORGING INTERNATIONALAGREEMENTS.
IT HAS MEANTENFORCING THEM.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICADIFFERENT, THAT'S WHAT MAKES
US EXCEPTIONAL.
>> Jon: WELL-- NO.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT AND OUR
SCULPTURES OF ELVIS PRESLEYMADE OUT OF BUTTER.
THAT'S SOMETHING.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: NOT A LOT OF
COUNTRIES HAVE.
(LAUGHTER)ELVIS.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONSVIOLATED INTERNATIONAL
NORMS.
INDEED IF THERE IS ONE THINGPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALWAYS
BEEN CLEAR ABOUT IT IS THATVIOLATIONS OF HALLOWED
INTERNATIONAL LAW LIKE THEGENEVA PROTOCOLS MUST BE
PUNISHED WHETHER IT BE USE OFCHEMICAL WEAPONS OR TORTURE.
>> WILL YOU APPOINT ASPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO
INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGATETHE GRAVEST CRIMES OF THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATIONINCLUDING TORTURE AND
WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THATANYBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW.
>> Jon: SEE THAT EVEN YOUNGWHIPPERSNAPPER OBAMA
WOULDN'T EVEN LET THAT GO.
NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW ANDI'M SURE THAT THAT CLIP
DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE ON IT.
>> ON THE OTHER HAND-- (LAUGHTER)
>> GO ON.
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, I ALSOHAVE A BELIEF THAT WE NEED
TO LOOK FORWARD AS OPPOSEDTO LOOKING BACKWARDS.
>> Jon: I MEAN IF LOOKINGBACKWARDS HAD ANY VALUE
WHATSOEVER, CARS WOULD HAVEREARVIEW MIRRORS.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THEY-- LOOK, I'M NOT
SAYING ENHANCEDINTERROGATION IS THE SAME AS
GASSING YOUR OWN PEOPLE.
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IT ISTOUGH TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT
THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO WAR TOALWAYS UPHELD INTERNATIONALLY
AGREED UPONNORMS SO SOON AS WHEN WE
OURSELVES PLAYED A GET OUTOF INTERNATIONAL NORMS FREE
CARD.
BUT IF THE SYRIAN CRISISDOES END, AND BY THE WAY,
THAT'S THE CARD THAT I NEVERSAW IN THE MONOPOLY GAME,
THAT WOULD HAVE-- WOULDN'TTHAT HAVE BEEN A NICE THING
