WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM
THE STRAZ CENTER OF THE
PERFORMING ARTS IN FAMILIAR BA
FLORIDA.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
I AM I AM NOT GOING TO WASTE ANY
OF YOUR TIME.
WE WILL GET DOWN TO COVERAGE OF
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
CONVENTION AND START WITH OLIVER
IN THE GRANT PARK AREA OF TAMPA.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> JON, TROPICAL STORM ISAAC HAS
PASSED, RETURNING THIS CITY BACK
TO ITS NORMAL ATMOSPHERIC
CONDITIONS.
>> SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FRIARS CLUB
STEAM ROOM AND A SUBWAY PLATFORM
IN HAITI.
>> IT IS.
>> Jon: IT IS A BIT MUGGY.
>> A BIT MUGGY, JON?  THE AMAZON
IS A BIT MUGGY.
THIS IS THE LAND THAT TIME
FORGOT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL CONVENTION IN TAMPA,
FLORIDA AT THE END OF AUGUST.
THERE IS NO PLACE THAT YOU WOULD
RATHER BE.
PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE AN
INSECT FROM AN INDIANA JONES
FILM OR A STRUGGLING STRAND OF
STREPTOCOCCUS.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK THE
REPUBLICANS WOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE
THEIR CONVENTION HERE IN TAMPA
AT THE END OF AUGUST?
>> THAT IS EASY, BECAUSE TAMPA
IS A PERFECT SYMBOL OF WHAT
OBAMA HAS DONE TO AMERICA.
IN JUST THREE AND A HALF YEARS,
THIS ONCE BUSTLING METROPOLIS IS
NOW A WIND AND RAIN SOAKED
FORECLOSED SHELL OF ITSELF.
ITS DENIZENS BARRICADING
THEMSELVES IN THEIR HOME, THE
DESPERATELY TRYING TO PROTECT
WHATEVER RAT-URINE-SOAKED METH
EQUIPMENT THEY STILL OWN.
>> Jon: NOW, JOHN, THAT IS A
BIT HYPERBOLIC, NOT EVERY SINGLE
PERSON WHO LIVES IN TAMPA
MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES
METHAMPHETAMINE.
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT, JON.
SOME OF THEM HAVE TO BUY IT.
IT'S NOT A PONZI SCHEME.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT TO
JESSICA WILLIAMS.
JESSICA HAS BEEN KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE STORM TRACK FOR HURRICANE
ISAAC SCHEDULED TO MAKE LANDFALL
IN NEW ORLEANS.
JESSICA.
>> BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.
>> Jon: WAIT, WHAT?  I'M
SORRY.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
>> I'M SORRY.
I KNOW, I WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO
BE DOING THE WEATHER BUT, JON,
THIS IS OBAMA'S AMERICA.
STORM, DROUGHT, AND ALL BECAUSE
HE HAS DONE NOTHING TO STEM THIS
EXPLOSION OF GAY MARRIAGE.
>> Jon: OH.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> WHAT NOW?  JON, I AM GLAD THE
REPUBLICANS ARE HERE IN FAMILIAR
PARKS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT
THAT NO HURRICANE WOULD HAVE
DARED TO BARREL DOWN ON NEW
ORLEANS UNDER REPUBLICAN'S
WATCH.
>> Jon: WANT KATRINA.
>>
>> BUSH INHERITED THAT FROM
CLINTON.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, JESSICA.
LET'S GO OUT TO JASON JONES.
JASON JONES.
YES, JASON.
JASON.
>> YES.
>> JON, I AM HERE IN TAMPA'S
FAMOUS STRIP CLUB DRINK.
OR AS THEY CALL IT HERE, TAMPA.
AND THANKS TO THE ANYTHING GOES
LIBERALISM OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION THIS WHOLE TOWN
HAS BECOME A THROBBING DEN OF
MORAL DEPRAVITY.
UGH.
WHERE ONCE CHURCHES AND MOM AND
POP PIE STORES, NOW YOU HAVE GOT
A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF STORE.
SHRINKING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
PIE.
>> JUST LOOK AT THESE BARE
ASSETS, BOTTOMS UP, FOXY'S,
MONLS VENUS, TEASERS, MISS
BEHAVIN', THE VAGINA FARM, LADY
--
>> Jon: THERE ARE A LOT OF
STRIP CLUBS BUT YOU THINK THAT
IS ALL OBAMA'S FAULT?
>> OH, OH, BLAME IT ON BUSH.
>> Jon: NO, I AM NOT BLAMING
IT ON BUSH.
I AM JUST SAYING --
>> SORRY, SORRY, JON, BLAME IT
ON BUSH IS JUST ANOTHER STRIP
CLUB.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
>> JON AS YOU KNOW IT IS ALL
OBAMA'S FAULT.
>> Jon: SO EVERYTHING IN
TAMPA, THE WEATHER, THE STRIP
CLUB, ECONOMIC HARD SHIM.
>> YES, YES.
THE FAKE PIRATE MARDI GRAS, ALL
OBAMA'S FAULT.
>> Jon: I FIND THIS VERY HARD
TO BELIEVE.
I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.
>> PERHAPS THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR
MIND.
>> Jon: SAMANTHA --
>> IN MIDAIR, JON.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!  HOECALLY
CLAP, WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WELL, JON, I WAS COMING OUT
OF A WAFFLE HOUSE, APPARENTLY
THE SCENT OF STIRRUP AND
CIGARETTE ASH PROVED
IRRESISTIBLE TO THIS, THE LOCALS
HAVE ASSURED ME IS A JUVENILE
PALMETTO BUG.
>> THAT IS NOT AN ADULT PALMETTO
BUG?
>> NO, NO, BUT IT WILL BE SOON.
THERE IS A CERTAIN SOCIALIST
TREE HUGGER PRESIDENT THAT
BANNED DDT.
>> Jon: I TELL YOU, I THINK
NIXON BANNED DDT.
>> WELL, IT WAS SOME DEMOCRAT, I
DON'T KNOW.
>> Jon: WELL, GOOD LUCK,
SAMANTHA.
