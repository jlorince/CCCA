AND EMPTY SOMETHING INTO MY FEED
BAG."
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE MEDIA
WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE THIS BABY
ARRIVE SO THEY COULD TURN THEIR
ATTENTION TO OTHER PRESSING
ISSUES.
>> I HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTION.
WHEN DO WE GET TO FIND OUT THE
NAME OF THE BABY?
>> WHAT IS HIS NAME?
GEORGE IS THE NAME.
EVERYONE SAYS IT'S GEORGE.
>> SOME OF THE HEAVY BETTING IS
ON JAMES.
>> ARTHUR.
PHILIP.
LOUIS ARE ALL TOP CONTENDERS.
IT MIGHT BE PRINCE CHARLES'
UNCLE LOUIS PRINCE MOUNT BATTON.
>> PRINCE CHARLES' NAME WASN'T
ANNOUNCED FOR ALMOST A MONTH.
THEY DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT IN
ENGLAND.
>> WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY.
I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU
RIGHT UP UNTIL I SAW THAT HORSE
IN A BAR.
BUT SOMETHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY
WHICH WAS JUST FALSE.
>> THE QUEEN HAS TO BE
DELIGHTED.
>> John: NO.
JUST NO.
THE QUEEN IS IS NOT NECESSARILY
DELIGHTED BY THIS BECAUSE SHE IS
NO LONGER DELIGHTED BY ANYTHING.
HER FACE WILL ALWAYS LOOK
EXACTLY HOW IT ALWAYS LOOKS.
A MIXTURE OF BOREDOM.
WHETHER IT'S WATCHING THE
SPECTACULAR OPENING CEREMONIES
OF THE OLYMPICS IN HER HOMETOWN
OR ATTENDING THE WEDDING OF HER
ELDEST GRANDSON OR BEHOLDING A
MASSIVE FLOTILLA JUST TO
CELEBRATE HER.
WHATEVER THE OCCASION, SHE HAS A
FACE WHICH DEMONSTRABLY SAYS I
DON'T GIVE A ROYAL [BLEEP].
WHICH BRINGS US TO A MUCH LARGER
QUESTION HERE.
WHY DO WE... WHY HAS COVERAGE OF
THE ROYAL BABY BEEN LIKE A NEW
SCREEN SAVER FOR THE WHOLE LAST
WEEK?
CNN WAS JUST BOTHERING BRITISH
LADIES.
>> I'M HERE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM
WITH A WOMAN ABOUT TO HAVE A
BABY.
SHE'S TAKING LAUGHING GAS FOR
PAIN.
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU LAUGH.
NOTHING IS FUNNY RIGHT NOW.
, NOTHING IS FUNNY.
John: REALLY?
NOTHING IS FUNNY.
NOT EVEN A SPECTACLE OF A NEWS
ORGANIZATION SHOVING MICROPHONES
IN THE FACE OF WOMEN IN LABOR?
ONLY TODAY CNN AND MS-NBC
LITERALLY AIRED THE CANNON
SALUTE IN ITS ENTIRE TEE.
NOW, THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT
ACTUALLY MEANS.
FOR THREE SOLID MINUTES OF THIS.
>> FIRE!
FNG.
>> John: I THINK IT WAS AROUND
THE TIME OF THE 48th CANNON
BLAST THAT YOU REALIZED, OH, NOW
I GET IT.
THE ROYAL BIRTH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
