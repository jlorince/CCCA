>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT ADOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, HIS
LATEST IS PBS'S "THE ROOSEVELTS:AN INTIMATE HISTORY."
>> THEY BELONGED TODIFFERENT PARTIES.
THEY OVERCAME DIFFERENTOBSTACLES.
THEY HAD DIFFERENTTEMPERMENTS AND STYLES OF
LEADERSHIP.
BUT IT WAS THE SIMILARITIESAND NOT THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE TWO THAT MEANTTHE MOST TO HISTORY.
BOTH WERE CHILDREN OFPRIVILEGE WHO CAME TO SEE
THEMSELVES AS CHAMPIONS OFTHE WORKING MAN AND EARNED
THE UNDYING ENMITY OF MANYOF THOSE AMONG WHOM THEY'D
GROWN TO MANHOOD.
THEY SHARED A SENSE OFSTEWARTSHIP OF THE
AMERICAN LAND, AN UNFAMEDLOVE FOR PEOPLE AND POLITICS.
>> Jon: PEOPLE SHOULD HAVEBOUGHT COLORED SHIRTS BACK THEN.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEYWOULDN'T.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM KEN BURNS.
TAKE IT IN, TAKE IT IN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KEN BURNS, IN A CAREER OF
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)KEN BURNS, IN A CAREER OF
WONDERFUL FILMS, THISIS-- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
THE PINNACLE BECAUSE YOUWILL PROBABLY GO HIGHER.
BUT THIS IS A REMARKABLEPIECE OF WORK.
>> THESE ARE THREE GREATPEOPLE THAT WE JUST DON'T
HAVE AROUND THIS KIND OF FOLKAND CALIBER TODAY.
AND THEY WERE AMAZING LEADERSAND THEY WERE ALL FOR THE
IDEA THAT WHEN WE ALL DOWELL, WE ALL DO WELL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
BUT YOU KNOW IT'SINTERESTING, YOU BRING UP,
WE DON'T HAVE THIS CALIBEROF LEADER ANY MORE.
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT WEPROBABLY MAKE THESE KIND OF
PEOPLE.
BUT WE DESTROY THEM.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE DON'T-- I'M WRONG.
WE DON'T SELECT FOR THEM.>> Jon: YES.
>> WE THINK THAT HEROES HAVE TOBE PERFECT AND WHEN WE DISCOVER
THE FIRST FLAW WE'RE LIKETHE SKY IS FALLING, LINDSEY
GRAHAM.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT WHEN WE DISCOVER...(LAUGHTER)
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE...
>> Jon: HOW WOULD TEDDYROOSEVELT BE KNOCKED
DOWN AND NOT BE ELECTABLE TODAY?
>> WELL, HE'S TOO HOT FORTHIS COOL MEDIUM OF
TELEVISION.
YOU KNOW, HE WOULDN'T MAKEIT OUT OF IOWA BECAUSE HE'D HAVE
TEN HOWARD DEANMOMENTS A DAY, YOU KNOW.
DELIGHTED! AND HE WOULDN'T DOIT...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND FRANKLIN ROOSEVELTOBVIOUSY IS IN A WHEELCHAIR
SO HE COULDN'T LIFT US UPTHROUGH THE DEPRESSION AND
GET US THROUGH THE SECONDWORLD WAR, THE TWO GREAT
CRISES OF THE CIVIL WAR.
I THINK WE HAVE FORGOTTENTHAT HEROISM IS ACTUALLY THIS
NEGOTIATION, SOMETIMES EVENA WAR BETWEEN A PERSON'S
VERY OBVIOUS STRENGTHS ANDTHEIR MAYBE NOT SO OBVIOUS
WEAKNESSES.
AND IT IS THAT NEGOTIATIONTHAT DEFINES HEROISM.
AND THEN WE'RE JUST READY TOTHROW THEM OUT THE FIRST
TIME THEY ARE ONE STEP SHORTOF PERFECTION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND OF COURSE THAT MEANSTHERE IS NOBODY OUT THERE
THAT WE COULD TRUST.
BUT YOU MEET THESE PEOPLE.
ALL OF THE ISSUES OF THEIRDAY ARE THE ISSUES OF OUR DAY.
WHAT IS THE ROLE OFGOVERNMENT?
WHAT IS THE NATUREOF LEADERSHIP?
HOW DO YOU BALANCE IDEALISMAND PRAGMATISM, THIS IS THE
STUFF OF NOW.
AND ELEANOR IS DEALING WITHTHINGS WITH WOMEN AND
POVERTY...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND CHILDREN AND IMMIGRATIONAND ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
AND SHE'S RIGHT ON ALL OFTHESE THINGS AND SHE'S 30
YEARS EARLY, 40 YEARS, 50YEARS.
WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUTTHE SAME ISSUES.
AND SO I THINK THAT IN MANYWAYS, THEIR LIVES, AS DEEP
FLAWED AS ALL THREE OF THEMARE, AS DEEPLY WOUNDED.
AND THEY ALL HAD TO ESCAPETHE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF
THESE CHILDHOOD WOUNDS, THEYREMAIN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
FOR US TO REMEMBER INPUTTING SOME SORT OF
PANTHEON...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND REMEMBER HOWTHEY DEALT WITH STUFF.
>> Jon: I'M STRUCK BY THEAUDACITY OF EACH OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS.
THE SPECTACULAR FAILURES.
>> YES.
>> Jon: THERE WAS VERYLITTLE THAT WAS THE
POLITICAL OR THE PRAGMATIC.>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD TOWORK THEIR WAY THROUGH VARIOUS
CHECKS ON PRESIDENT POWER.
BUT THE AUDACITY OF WHATTHEY WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH IS
VERY STRIKING, AND HOW THEYUSED THE PRESIDENTIAL
PULPIT, YOU KNOW, WE LEARN A LOTABOUT WELL, YOU CAN'T, THROUGH
CONGRESS...>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND EVERYBODY.
MAN, TEDDY ROOSEVELT WENTAFTER BIG BUSINESS.
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, GOOD,HATE ME, I DON'T CARE.
>> YES, EXACTLY.
THE MALEFACTORS OF GREATWEALTH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> I WELCOME YOUR HATRED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NO, NO, AND HE'S ONEOF, AND THEN THE GREAT
THING IS THE FLEXIBILITY.
HE TURNS AROUND, FRANKLIN TURNSAROUND AFTER MAKING
ENEMIES ALL THROUGH THE '30sAND SAYS, HEY, GUESS WHAT, I'M
GOING TO MAKE YOU A LOT OFMONEY.
YOU NEED TO OUTPRODUCEEVERYBODY ELSE AND BY THE
END OF WORLD WAR II MORETHAN 50% OF ALL THE
MANUFACTURING IS HAPPENINGIN THE UNITED STATES.
AND THAT'S FRANKLINROOSEVELT SAYING NOPE, 5,000
PLANES IS NOT ENOUGH THISYEAR, I NEED 50,000 PLANES,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,MR. PRESIDENT.
YOU WILL DO IT, AND THEY DID DOIT.
AND IT WAS BECAUSE YOU HADSOMEBODY SAYING YOU WILL DO IT.
IT IS THAT AUDACITY.
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM SOREMARKABLE.
THE KEY IS FEAR.
ALL OF THEM HAD TO FACE FEARIN SOME WAY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WELL, TEDDY HADTHE HEALTH ISSUES AS A CHILD,
HE WAS AN ASTHMATIC.
>> HEALTH AND UNBELIEVABLETRAGEDY.
HIS WIFE AND HIS MOTHER...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> DIED ON THE SAME DAY IN THESAME HOUSE ON 20th STREET.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IT WASVALENTINE'S DAY, RIGHT?
>> IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY.>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
>> I MEAN, IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.
AND HE WAS HIMSELFSUSCEPTIBLE TO DEPRESSION.
HE CAME FROM A FAMILY OFMENTAL ILLNESS AND
ALCOHOLISM.
AND SO HE SAID BLACK CARECAN RARELY SIT BEHIND A
RIDER WHOSE PACE IS FASTENOUGH, WHICH IS A NICE 19th
CENTURY WAY OF SAYING YOUCAN OUTRUN YOUR DEMONS.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> AND HIS FAVORITE NIECEELEANOR WAS THE SAME WAY.
THEY WERE IN CONSTANT MOTION,WHICH MAKES FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT
EVEN MORE SPECTACULAR BECAUSEWHEN HE COULD
LONGER TAKE A STEP, UNAIDED.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> HE'S, HE CAN'T OUTRUN ANYDEMONS.
HE'S STILL WILLING TO FACETHAT FEAR IN THE BEST SORT
OF WAY.
AND ELEANOR HAS THISHORRIBLE CHILDHOOD.
YOU KNOW, BOTH PARENTS ARE GONEBY THE TIME SHE'S TEN.
SHE'S WITH REPRESSIVE, PIOUSRELATIVES THAT WITH TWO, WITH A
AN ABUSIVE NURSE AND TWOALCOHOLIC UNCLES.
AND SHE IS A FEARFUL PERSONWHO DECIDES TO WAKE UP EVERY
DAY.
EVERY SINGLE DAY OF HER LIFEAND FACE THE FEAR.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> AND WHICH IS AN AMAZING,AMAZING THING.
>> I MEAN, I THINK THE LESSONHERE IS RELATIVELY CLEAR IN THAT
WE HAVE BEEN TREATING OURCHILDREN TOO WELL.
>> YES.
RIGHT. EXACTLY.
>> AND THAT IF WE WANTGREATNESS.
>> WE NEED TO HAVE TRAGEDY.
>>Jon: WE NEED TO ABANDON.
>> AND CORPORAL PUNISHMENT.
>> Jon: WILL YOU, WILL YOU STICKAROUND.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLE MOREABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE
PROJECT AND HOW YOU WENT ABOUTCREATING IT.
BECAUSE IT IS, I MEAN, IT'SMAGNIFICENT.
