>> John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON
STEWART WHO IS SPENDING THE
SUMMER WITH A LONELY
MILLIONAIRE.
SIGH WHAT YOU WILL-- HE'S MAKING
$3,000 AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
KISS ON THE MOUTH.
SO DON'T JUDGE.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN
"LOVELACE," HANK AZARIA IS WITH
US.
VERY, VERY GOOD.
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
CONGRESS.
>> A NEW CNN POLL SHOWS JUST HOW
FED UP WE ARE WITH CONGRESS.
77% DISAPPROVE OF HOW CONGRESS
IS HANDLING ITS JOB.
>> John: CONGRATULATIONS,
CONGRESS.
77%.
YOU MAY BE ABOUT TO BECOME THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE'S MOST OFFENSE
OF THE "C" WORD.
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AFTER ( BLEEP ).
BUT, LOOK, THERE'S STILL TWO
DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE AUGUST
RECESS.
THE "C" WORD COULD STILL PULL
THIS AROUND.
THEY COULD PASS IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
IT'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THE
SENATE, SO COME O"C" WORD, LET'S
DO THIS.
>> IMMIGRATION REFORM.
THAT'S STUCK AND IT HAS A VERY
DIFFICULT ROAD OF GETTING
ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE.
>> John: OKAY, LET'S JUST BE
HONEST NOW-- THE HOUSE IS
CLEARLY WHERE THINGS GO TO DIE.
IT'S WHERE PARENTS ARE GOING TO
START TELLING THEIR KIDS THEIR
AGING PETS WENT.
"OH, NOW, FLUFFY'S FINE,
DARLING.
SHE JUST GOT STUCK IN COMMITTEE
COMMITTEE."
( LAUGHTER )
ONE CHALLENGE FACING THIS
IMMIGRATION BILL IS--
( LAUGHTER )
ONE CHALLENGE FACING THIS
IMMIGRATION BILL IS A CERTAIN
LEVEL OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT
THE PEOPLE THAT IT IS INTENDED
TO HELP.
>> THEY WILL SAY TO ME AND
OTHERS WHO WOULD DEFEND THE RULE
OF LAW, "WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE 11 MILLION.
SOME OF THEM ARE
VALEDICTORIANS."
WELL, MY ANSWER TO THAT IS FOR
EVERY ONE WHO IS A VALEDICTORIAN
THERE ARE ANOTHER 100 OUT THERE
THEY WAY 130 POUNDS AND HAVE
CALVES THE SIZE OF CANTALOUPES
BECAUSE THEY'RE HAULING 75
POUNDS OF MARIJUANA ACROSS THE
DESERT.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> John: WHAT?
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN
TO UNPACK A STATEMENT LIKE THAT.
FIRST, I THINK THAT IS HARD
PROOF THAT STEVE KING DOES NOT
USE DRUGS.
BECAUSE-- DOES HE HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT 75 POUNDS OF MARIJUANA
WOULD LOOK LIKE?
( LAUGHTER )
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO
HAUL ACROSS A DESERT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN FACT, COULD WE SEE A LITTLE
BIT MORE OF THAT PICTURE?
OKAY, SO HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE
THING.
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BLAME
STEVE KING.
THIS IS PROBABLY JUST WHAT HIS
CONSTITUENTS WANT, RIGHT?
>> 69% OF STEVE KING'S
CONSTITUENTS IN IOWA'S FOURTH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WANT
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
59% SUPPORT A PATHWAY TO
PERMANENT RESIDENTS FOR
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS UNDER
THE AGE OF 15.
>> John: WOW!
TO GO THIS HARD AGAINST YOUR OWN
CONSTITUENCY AND BASIC REASON,
YOU REALLY MUST HAVE BALLS THE
SIZE OF CANTALOUPES.
( LAUGHTER )
AND UNREPRESENTATIVE KING IS NOT
ALONE IN HIS DISTRUST OF THESE
IMMIGRANTS.
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY
OF THEM WHO COME HERE ILLEGALLY
COME SO ILL PREPARED FOR SUCCESS
SUCCESS.
THEY COME WITH LACK OF
EDUCATION.
THEY COME WITH LACK OF SKILL.
THEY COME WITH LACK OF ABILITY
OR UNWILLINGNESS TO ASIMULATE
INTO THE CULTURE.
>> John: EXACTLY.
DO WE REALLY WANT THESE TIRED,
POOR, HUDDLE MASSES IN THIS
COUNTRY?
SHOW ME THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.
SHOW ME THE PLACE!
SHOW IT TO
