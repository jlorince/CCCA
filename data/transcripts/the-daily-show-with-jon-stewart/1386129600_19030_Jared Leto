OTHER THAN OBVIOUSLY BEING AGOOD ACTOR --
[LAUGHTER]WOULD BE WHEN NOT WORKING, NOT
DOING FOODSTUFF.
SO MUCH OF MY DOWNTIME IS FOODBASED.
IT'S BASED ON LIKE -- I'M GOINGTO SIT, SPORTS CENTER IS ON AND
THAT LOOKS LIKE A PIZZAI'M GOING
TOHAVE SPORTS
CENTERAND PIZZA.

WE LOOKED INTO IT AND THEYPROMPTLY SUED US FOR $30
MILLION.
WE FOUGHT THEM FORA FEW YEARS AND
FILMED IT ALL.
>> Jon: WHEN THEY INFORMED YOUYOU SOLD MILLIONS OF RECORDS AND
OWED THEM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,AND THEY SAID, OH YOU
FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT?
>> THEY TALK ABOUT THIS CRAZYBUSINESS AND THAT UNHOLY
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ART ANDCOMMERCE.
>> Jon: THE RECORD COMPANIESARE GOING AWAY.
THE DISTRIBUTION MODEL, THEY'REGOING TO BE A
THING OF THE PAST.
THAT'S WHY THEY WANT $30 MILLIONBECAUSE THEY REALIZE IN A COUPLE
OF YEARS THEY ARE OUT THE DOOR.
