PRIZE WINNING REPORTER, HERNEW BOOK IS CALLED FIVE DAYS
AT MEMORIAL LIFE-AND-DEATHIN A STORM RAVAGED HOSPITAL.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM SHERI FINK.
(APPLAUSE)THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THE BOOK IS CALLED FIVE DAYSAT MEMORIAL.
IT INVOLVES A HOSPITAL INNEW ORLEANS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AFTER KATRINA IT ISPERHAPS THE DARKEST BOOK, I
HAD TO READ LORD OF THEFLIES AFTER THIS TO REGAIN
MY LOVE OF HUMANITY.
>> I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T READMY FIRST BOOK ABOUT A
HOSPITAL IN THE GENOCIDE.
>> Jon: IS THAT YOUR FIRSTBOOK.
>> YEAH SO THIS IS LIGHTER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: CAN'T YOU WRITE
ABOUT JUST LIKE, I DON'TKNOW A MUMPS OUTBREAK.
THIS WAS I KEPT WAITING FORA HERO TO EMERGE IN THIS
STORY AT THE HOSPITAL,WHETHER IT BE A PLANNER OR
RESPONDER OR DOCTOR.
AND THEY DON'T EVER SEEM TOEMERGE.
>> THERE'S NO ONE HERO ANDTHERE'S NO ONE VILLAIN HERE.
>> Jon: YES.
>> YES, AND IF I HAVE ONETHING TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT
THIS, IT IS BE PREPARED FOREVERYTHING TO FAIL IN A
DISASTER.
AND THAT'S WHY THE BOOK LOOKSA LOT AT LIKE INDIVIDUAL
DECISIONS, WHAT HAPPENS WHENEVERYTHING FAILS.
BECAUSE PREPAREDNESSRESPONSE IS ALL ABOUT
INFRASTRUCTURE,ORGANIZATIONS AND
INDIVIDUALS.
AND THIS IS REALLY LIKE HOWCAN WE BE MORE PREPARED.
>> Jon: WELL, YOU WOULDTHINK LIKE YOU COULD LOOK AT
THIS AND THINK OH NEWORLEANS IT'S SO CHAOTIC DOWN
THERE OF COURSE THEY'RE NOTPREPARED.
THE EXACT SAME THING, LIKENO GENERATORS OR ALL LOCATED
BELOW SEA LEVEL HAPPENED INNEW YORK CITY DURING
HURRICANE SANDY DOWN AT NYU.
>> WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED,EIGHT YEARS LATER.
IT'S CRAZY.
I MEAN I THINK THAT IN NEWORLEANS THEY LEARNED.
HOSPITALS ARE ABOUT POWERAND WATER.
YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT.
AND WE LOST THAT IN NEWYORK.
AND IT WAS CRAZY TO SEEAFTER ALL THE LESSONS WE
SHOULD HAVE LEARNED FROMKATRINA, THAT AGAIN WE'RE
SEEING BABIES BEING CARRIEDDOWN DARKENED STAIRCASES, SO
YES WE'VE GOT INFRASTRUCTUREALL OVER THIS COUNTRY
WHETHER IT'S IN, YOU KNOW,TORNADO ALLEY, HOSPITALS UP
TO CODE, EARTHQUAKE ZONES.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M GOING TOBE CHECKED INTO A HOSPITAL IF
I HAVE SOMETHING THAT NEEDSTO BE DONE, I WANT TO ASK.
SO WE NEED TO BE ASKINGTOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR
HOSPITALS.
WE NEED TO BE ASKING TOUGHQUESTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT,
ABOUT REGULATIONS THAT MAYBENEED TO BE STRENGTHENED THAT
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS SAIDAFTER KATRINA, NEED TO BE
STRENGTHENED.
STILL HAVEN'T BEEN RELEASEDALL THESE YEARS LATER.
SO WE HAVE MAJOR THINGS TOLEARN AND THAT'S WHY I WROTE
THIS FIVE DAYS ATMEMORIAL.
>> Jon: IF YOU ASKED, IF IGO INTO THE HOSPITAL AND SAY
TO THEM, LIKE, SO HOW'S YOURGENERATOR SITUATION.
>> YES, ASK THEM.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T GETSOMEONE TO SEE YOU LET ALONE
TO DISCUSS, CAN I JUST SAY,LIKE THAT BIG GUY OVER THERE,
IF IT ALL GOES TO HELL, CANHE CARRY ME DOWN THE STAIRS.
LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD ASK.
>> THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED INTHIS HOSPITAL, TOO.
THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WASHEAVYSET AND THEY DECIDED WE
CAN'T RESCUE HIM BECAUSE HEWEIGHS TOO MUCH.
THERE IS A LOT OF OBESEPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THESETHINGS BEFOREHAND.
BUT THAT'S WHY MAYBE WE NEEDREGULATIONS.
BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR US TOASK THOSE QUESTIONS.
BUT WE SHOULD.
ARE YOUR-- YOU'RE IN A FLOODZONE, ARE THE GENERATORS IN
THE BASEMENT?
>> Jon: YES THAT'S WHERE WEKEEP OUR GENERATORS, MA'AM.
SO LIKE YOU COME IN AND I'MHAVING A HEART ATTACK, WHERE
ARE YOUR GENERATORS, THEY'REIN THE BASEMENT, YOU GO ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WELLWHAT'S THE WEATHER GOING TO
BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.
BECAUSE I GOT-- IT TRULY IS-- IT'S MIND-BOGGLING.
AND THE THING THAT HAPPENSHERE THAT I THINK IS SO
ASTONISHING AND BOY, IT'SHARD NOT TO JUDGE IT, IS SO
ONE OF THE DOCTORS STARTSKILLING PEOPLE.
I MEAN IF I MAY -->> I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO DO.
>> Jon: HE STARTS-- HESTARTS EUTHANIZING, HE
STARTS EUTHANIZING PEOPLETHINKING LIKE OH, THIS ISN'T
GOING TO WORK.
>> THIS IS THE STAKES OFTHE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS.
IS THAT THERE WERE DECENT,HARDWORKING, WELL RESPECTED
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHOLITERALLY FELT LIKE THAT WAS
THEIR CHOICE.
NOW WAS THAT THE RIGHTCHOICE?
I THINK A LOT OF US WOULDSAY NO, THERE WERE 20 PEOPLE
IN THE END WHO A FORENSICPATHOLOGIST THOUGHT RECEIVED
THESE DRUGS AND DIED, 20PEOPLE, THAT'S LIKE IN
BETWEEN COLUMBINE AND YOUKNOW, THE LATEST SHOOTING,
MASS SHOOTINGS IN NEWTOWN.
>> Jon: YOU LIVE IN A DARK,DARK PLACE.
>> SO I'M SAYING WE NEEDPREPAREDNESS.
THESE ARE THE STAKES BUTYOU KNOW, THEY FELT LIKE AT
THAT POINT THEY WERE DOINGSOMETHING MERCIFUL.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT IT WASINTERESTING WHEN THEY CAME
OUT, EVERYBODY SORT OF, YOUKNOW, IT'S LIKE AT THE END
OF THAT DISASTER MOVIE, THEYALWAYS CLIMB OUT OF THE
OVERTURNED SHIP TO THESUNLIGHT.
AND THEY ALL WERE LIKE THEYTOOK LIKE A VOW TO NEVER
TALK ABOUT IT.
AND TO SAY, AND NOTHINGHAPPENED, WE WILL NEVER TALK
ABOUT THIS.
>> THANK YOU FOR SAYINGTHAT.
IT IS LIKE A CODE OF SILENCEBECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID.
A DOCTOR ENDED UPGETTING ARRESTED AND ACCUSED
OF HAVING KILLING THEPATIENTS.
I THINK IT ALL COMES DOWN TOIN A DISASTER DO WE THINK
THAT EXCEPTIONAL TIMES ARETIMES WHEN WE-- YOU KNOW,
SHOULD LET SOME OF OUR MORALVALUES SLIP OR IS IT A TIME
WHEN WE WANT TO HOLD EVENMORE TIGHTLY TO OUR DEEPEST
MORAL VALUES.
AND I DON'T THINK THEDOCTORS-- .
>> Jon: HOLD MORE TIGHTLY,OH, DID I GIVE AWAY THE
ENDING?
AND THAT'S WHY HERE IS WHATIS SO GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK,
IT'S ACTUALLY FREEZE DRIEDFOOD, YOU CAN EAT IT.
IT IS A GENERATOR.
I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S A WILDSTORY.
AND THIS WILL BE A MOVIE.
THIS WILL BE A MOVIE ANDSOMEONE WILL WIN AN OSCAR
BECAUSE THEY'LL PLAY LIKE ADARK, DARK-- DARK, THIS IS-- YOU
KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TOSEE BRAD PITT AND ANGELINA
JOLIE, I WOULD LIKE TOSEE REALLY GOOD LOOKING
PEOPLE GO TO THIS DARK, DARKPLACE.
>> BUT LET'S LEARN FROM IT.
LET'S COME OUT OF THIS TOTHE LIGHT.
>> Jon: YES, WE SHOULD ALSOLEARN FROMS IT, BUT SHOULD
GET A REALLY GOOD MOVIE OUTOF THIS.
AND THEN LEARN FROM IT.
>> AT LEAST.
>> Jon: FIVE DAYS ATMEMORIAL, ON THE BOOK
SHELVES NOW, SHERI FINK THANKYOU
