>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.
I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE BACK ON THE AIR.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED OUR SHOW, WE WERE ON A LITTLE BIT OF A HIATUS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS
BECAUSE WE POSSESS THE SAME WORK ETHIC AS CHILDREN IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU BECAUSE WHILE WE WERE GONE IN JUST THREE WEEKS EVERYTHING
HAPPENED EVER.
TRAGEDIES, INCOMPETENCY.
I DON'T KNOW EVEN KNOW WHERE TO
[BLEEP] START TONIGHT.
GUN DEBATE?
HILLARY CLINTON'S FAKE FAKE BRAIN BLOOD CLOT?
BARACK OBAMA IS FILLING UP HIS CABINET WITH OLD WHITE GUYS AND REPUBLICANS LIKE CHUCK HAGEL?
MEANWHILE SOME REPUBLICANS ARE UP WITH THE HAGEL PICK BECAUSE OF HIS POSSIBLE ANTIGAY VIEWS.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FILLING IN WITH THE OLD WHITE GUYS AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE HELPING THE THE GAYS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE DAILY SHOW IS GOING TO DO WITH THAT STORY.
THERE'S NO TIME.
THERE'S TOO MUCH.
DAM DAMN YOU MAYANS.
WHY COULDN'T THE WORLD HAVE ENDED WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO END BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WAS
PLANNING ON.
NOW I'VE GOT THREE TRILLION CANS OF CREAMED CORN IN MY BASEMENT.
WAAA!
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO ALL THAT IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO BECAUSE AFTER THAT WE HAVE A TWO-MONTH
MIDWINTER HIATUS.
BUT WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE.
HERE WE GO.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, WORLD RENOWN THES PEE AND GERARD DEPARDIEU HAS DECIDE
