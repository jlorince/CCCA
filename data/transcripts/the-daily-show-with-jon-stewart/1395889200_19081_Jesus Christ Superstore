[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
TONIGHT'S GUEST JUDE LAW WILL BEJOINING US.
BUT FIRST, AS YOU KNOW,AMERICA'S RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED A
BRAND NEW HEALTH CARE LAWDESIGNED BY OUR PRESIDENT TO
KILL OLD PEOPLE AND ALLOW RUSSIATO INVADE CRIMEA.
[LAUGHTER]NOW. BUT SOME AMERICANS AREWILLING TO
FIGHT THIS LAW ALL THE WAY TOTHE SUPREME COURT.
AND WHILE THEY DON'T CITECOMMUNISM AND ELDERICIDEAS THE REASON
FOR THEIR OBJECTION I THINK WECAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES.
>> THE NEW HEALTH CARE LAWREQUIRES COMPANIES TO OFFER
INSURANCE THAT INCLUDESFREE BIRTH CONTROL.
RELIGIOUS EMPLOYERS ACROSS THECOUNTRY STARTED FILING LAWSUITS.
THEY SAY THAT VIOLATESOUR RELIGIOUS BEEIEFS.
THE COURT AGREED TO DECIDE THATISSUE IN A CASE INVOLVING
HOBBY LOBBY. IT'S A NATION WIDECHAIN OF CRAFT SUPPLY STORES.
>> Jon: THIS IS A SUPREME COURTCASE, IT IS HOBBY LOBBY V.SEBELIUS, THE
SILLIEST SOUNDING SUPREME COURTPLAINTIFF SINCE 1954'S BROWN V
BOARD OF TITTY FARTS.
NOW -- IT'S A REAL CASE.
[LAUGHTER]TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS LOBBY OF
HOBBIES.>> HOBBY LOBBY IS FAMILY-RUN
BUSINESS IT'S OWNERS SAY ISBASED ON BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES
FOUNDED 38 YEARS AGO BY DAVIDAND BARBARA GREEN.
>> Jon: HOW IS IT BASED ONBIBILCAL PRINCIPLES? I'M A
LITTLE RUSTY ON THE NEWTESTAMENT, WHERE THE BIBLE
DOES IT MENTION CRAFT STORES?I'M FAMILIAR WITH JESUS.
THIS JESUS.
NOT SO MUCH WITH THIS JESUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]WITH A --
[LAUGHTER]WHAT IS THE LARGER PRINCIPLE AT
PLAY HERE?
>> THEY ARE ASKING THE COURT TOFIND THAT THEIR FOR-PROFIT
COMPANY HAS THE SAME RELIGIOUSFREEDOM AS A CHURCH OR
INDIVIDUAL.
>> Jon: SURE, WHY -- OF COURSEHOBBY LOBBY WANTS THAT.
THEY ARE A PIOUS CORPORATION.
THERE WOULD NEVER BE A CASEEMANATING FROM THAT OTHER CRAFT
STORE MICHAELS. FOR GOD SAKES
THAT PLACE IS SAY GODLESS(bleep) PALACE WITH YARN.
[LAUGHTER]THAT JOKE BROUGHT TO YOU BY
MICHAELS.
MICHAEL'S IT'S A GODLESS (bleep)PALACE WITH YARN.
[ LAUGHTER ]SEE--
SOME OF THE AUDIENCE HASOBVIOUSLY BEEN THERE. SO WHAT
SAYETH THE LIBERAL JUSTICETO THIS ARGUMENT.
>> JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR SAID WHATABOUT YOU KNOWRELIGIOUS ADHERENTS
THAT DON'T BELIEVE INTRANSFUSIONS, BLOOD
TRANSFUSIONS,VACCINATIONS. AND MR. CLEMENT
RESPONDED WELL IT DOES DEPEND ONTHE BURDEN THAT'S BEING PLACED.
IT'S POSSIBLE THE GOVERNMENTWOULD HAVE A COMPELLING INTEREST
IN IMPOSING THAT BURDEN BUTTHERE'S NO COMPELLING INTEREST
HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.
>> Jon: SURE THERE'S NOCOMPELLING INTEREST TO HOBBY
LOBBY'S LAWYER PAUL CLEMENT,HE'S GOT A PENIS.
BABIES RARELY GROW INSIDE OFTHOSE EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE
TERRIBLE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGERMOVIE. LOOK WHO'S IN MY PENIS.
IT'S NOT A TUMOR.
GET INTO MY PENIS IF YOU WANT TOLIVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]ALL RIGHT, WHAT SAYETH THE MAN
THAT WILL ACTUALLY DECIDE THISCASE SWING JUSTICE KENNEDY.
>> JUSTICE KENNEDY FOCUSED ONEMPLOYERS RIGHTS SAYING IF A
BUSINESS CAN BE FORCED TO PAYFOR ALL TYPES OF CONTRACEPTION
THEY CAN QUOTE BE FORCED INPRINCIPLE TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS.
>> Jon: RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE.
IN FACT IT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITEOF YES FOR THAT WHICH I BELIEVE
IS NO BECAUSE CONTRACEPTION ISNOT THE SAME THING AS ABORTION.
THAT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT.
>> THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO TAKEHOBBY LOBBY'S RELIGIOUS VIEWS AS
THEY COME. SO OFF THE TABLE ISANY QUESTION ABOUT THE ACCURACY
OF HOW HOBBY LOBBY AND ANOTHERCOMPANY CONESTOGA WOOD
VIEW THESE CONTRACEPTIVES ASAGENTS OF CAUSING ABORTION.
>> Jon: LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT, CORPORATIONS AREN'T
JUST PEOPLE, THEY AREILL-INFORMED PEOPLE WHOSE
FACTUALLY INCORRECT BELIEFS MUSTBE UPHELD  BECAUSE THEY
SINCEREISLY BELIEVE THEM ANYWAY.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY AT HOBBYLOBBY THEY FEED THEIR 16,000
EMPLOYEES WITH BUT FIVE LOAVESAND TWO FISH.
WHAT? THE EMPLOYEES ARE STILLHUNGRY? THEY BELIEVE YOU AREN'T.
