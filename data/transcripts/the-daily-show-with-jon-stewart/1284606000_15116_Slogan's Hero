PALIN.
JOHN OLIVER FILED THIS REPORT.

OPPORTUNITY.

NOT THE WHITE MAN'S BITCH.

>> NOT THE WHITE MAN'S BITCH.
>> LET ME JUST CHECK, I ASKED
YOU FOR YOUR STATEMENT OF
PRINCIPLE, DIDN'T I?

POSSIBLE TITLE FOR THE NEXT LI'L
KIM ALBUM THANK IS MY STATEMENT
OF PRINCIPLE.
I'M EAGER TO BRING FORTH THE
ISSUES EFFECTING THE COMMUNITY
AND THE PLACES I LIVE IN.
>> THIS ISN'T SITTING WELL WITH
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT STEPHANY
FINLEY.

I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT
PLACE.

DO YOU WANT TO ADDED BITCH TO THE
END?
IT MIGHT GIVE IT MORE PUNCH, I
SPECIALIZE IN RESULTS, BITCH!
>> I DON'T NEED THAT KIND OF
PUNCH.
I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PART
OF THE STATEMENT IS OFFENSIVE
AND WHY IT'S OFFENSIVE.
WHITEMEN ARE PUT TOGETHER AS ONE
WORD MEANING AN ENTITY NOT A
COLOR.
THE WHITE MAN IS DEFINED AS
POWER STRUCTURE OR THOSE IN
POWER.
INTICH SAY FEMALE DOG AND A
FEMALE DOG MADE TO BREED WHEN
TOLD TO AND TO ROLL OVER.
>>
>> ARE YOU SURE IS THIS NOT
(bleep) CRAZY WITH CRAZY BEING
AN IRRATIONAL ACT (bleep)
BEING AN INTENSIFIER, THIS BEING
THE ACTION WHICH YOU ARE DOING?
>> IT'S DEFINITELY CRAZY OR OUT
OF THE ORDINARY OR IRRATIONAL.
I'M STATING I'M NOT YOUR AVERAGE
POLITICIAN, NOT A TOKEN OR
ROLLOVER TO THE POWER STRUCTURE.
>> I HEAD THE OUT TO SEE HOW HER
MESSAGE WAS POLLING.

BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO
STAND ON YOUR ISSUES.

HER WILLINGNESS TO TAKE IT ON.
>> WHAT IS A BETTER CAMPAIGN
PHRASE I SPECIALIZE IN RESULTS
OR NOT THE WHITE MAN'S BITCH?
>> NOT THE WHITE MAN'S BITCH.
>> YOU SUPPORT THAT MESSAGE AS A
WHITE MAN.
YOU KNOW THIS MEANS YOU GET LESS
BITCHES.
>> I CAN DEAL WIT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE REST OF THE
WORLD CAN BUT CAN I DEAL WITH
IT.
>> WHAT DID THESE VOTERS KNOW
ABOUT ELECTIONS?
I NEEDED AN EXPERT SO I SAT DOWN
WITH FORMER GIULIANI
COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER MIKE
McCOIN.
>> IT'S A RIDICULOUS STATEMENT
AND ONE LIKELY TO BE MET WITH
GREAT FAILURE.
PLAYING THE RACE CARD OVERTLY IS
OFFENSIVE.
>> DON'T PLAY IT SO OVERTLY.
BE MORE SUBTLE ABOUT IT.
>> IF THERE'S A POWERFUL WHITE
POLITICIAN RECOGNIZABLE TO THE
COMMUNITY GO AFTER THAT PERSON,
ATTACK THAT PERSON.
>> DON'T BE SO GENERALLY RACIVE,
BE MORE SPECIFICALLY RACIST?
>> RIGHT.
>> CLEARLY SHE NEEDED A PLAN B.
BEFORE YOU PUT NOT THE WHITE
MAN'S BITCH ON THE PWHAOLT DID
YOU EVER THINK OF OTHER OPTIONS?

MY STATEMENT WAS TWO WORDS BUT I
THOUGHT THAT THIS STATEMENT MUST
BE OWE OFFENSIVE -- OFFENSIVE TO
THE PEOPLE:  NEW BOOTY.

THE SAME OLD ASS IN OFFICE.

NEW BOOTY IS NOT GOING TO WORK.
SHE WOULD GO OVER LIKE A
TERRIBLE -- IT WOULD BE THE
HINDENBERG.

>> CAN YOU NOT PICTURE AN OLD
COUPLE SITTING AROUND THE TABLE.
>> HONEY WHAT IS WRONG?
>> IT'S POLITICS AS USUAL IN
WISCONSIN.
>> I KNOW THE TAXES.
>> AND THE SPENDING.
>> WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL
REPRESENT US.
>> WE NEED CHANGE.
WE NEED NEW BOOTY.
>> IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AD
BUT I DON'T THINK IT RESONATES.
NEW BOOTY IS NOT GOING TO WORK.
I DON'T GET THE LANGUAGE.
>> NEW BOOTY.
>> NEW BOOTY.
>> YEAH.
>> I LIKE IT WHEN YOU SAY IT.
>> NEW BOOTY.
