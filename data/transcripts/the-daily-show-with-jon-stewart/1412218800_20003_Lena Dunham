PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, LENA DUNHAM.
[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
>> HI.
>> Jon: I LOVE THIS BOOK. YOU'REA VERY GOOD WRITER.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: FUNNY ESSAYS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT IVER MUCH ADMIRE ABOUT YOU?
YOUR ABILITY AT A YOUNG AGE TO ARTICULATE MOTIVATIONS OF YOUR
BEHAVIOR THAT EVEN YOU DON'T -- THAT TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF
WELL, AND THE REASONS YOUBEHAVE IN WAYS THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU END UP BEING SELF-CRITICALOF OR THINGS LIKE THAT.
LIKE, YOUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> WELL, THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?
>> PROBABLY IF I HAD A LITTLEMORE OF THAT ABILITY,
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THETHINGS IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND IT WOULD NOT HAVENECESSITATED WRITING THIS
DISASTROUS TOME.
>> Jon: POST, POST-ABILITY. NOTAT ALL.
>> BUT, UMM, WELL, I'VE BEEN INA LOT OF THERAPY.
>> Jon: OH.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.
IT'S DEFINITELY A PART OF THEEQUATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I JUST, IHAVE THIS SENSE THAT IF I DON'T
MAKE SOME SORT OF -- IF I DON'TMAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THESE
EVENTS THEN THEY HAPPENED INVAIN, AND I MIGHT AS WELL JUST,
YOU KNOW, GO BURY MYSELF IN AYARD.
>> Jon: IS IT THAT WHEN YOU ARE,SO, WHEN YOU WERE OUT
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, WEREYOU ALWAYS IN SOME WAYS
OBSERVING YOURSELF AS YOU WEREIN THESE SITUATIONS?
OR IS THIS ALL KIND OF A POST MORTEM ON THESE EVENTS?
>> I WISH IT WAS MORE OF A POST MORTEM. I MEAN, ONE OF MY,
ONE OF THE LIKE PRIMARYCRITICISMS THAT PEOPLE IN MY
LIFE HAVE OF ME IS LIKE YOUHAVE JUST GONE INTO THAT GLAZED
PLACE WHERE I KNOW YOU'RELOOKING AT THIS AND LIKE
KIND OF LIKE MOVING THE DETAILSAROUND IN YOUR HEAD AND
DECIDING THAT THIS IS A SCENE,AND IT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE WE'RE
PEOPLE AND WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW.
SO, I TRY TO FIGHT THAT, BUTIT'S  CHALLENGING.
>> Jon: PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFEDO KNOW THAT? THEY'LL SAY,
OH YOU'RE WRITING THISDOWN, AREN'T YOU?
>> MY DAD 100% KNOWS THIS.LIKE, HE'S LIKE,
YOU'RE GETTING DISASSOCIATEIVE HERE.
HE'S GOT A THING HE SAYS WHEREHE LOOKS AT ME AND IS LIKE,
NO, DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.
>> Jon: AND, I'M AMAZED.
AND HE'S STILL ENGAGED IN THAT WAY.
LIKE, I'M A DAD, AND I CHECKEDOUT LIKE THREE YEARS AGO.
LIKE THAT'S, THAT'S AWESOME.
>> HE'S LIKE TOO ENGAGED.>> Jon: OH REALLY?
>> HE CALLED ME LIKE SEVEN TIMESON THE WAY HERE.
I MEAN, HE'S MY FAVORITE.
SO IT'S WORKING OUT FINE BUT --
>> Jon: WAIT, DOES YOUR MOM KNOW THAT?
>> SHE'S MY OTHER FAVORITE.
THEY CURRY FAVOR ATDIFFERENT TIMES.
TODAY MY DAD'S REALLY GREAT, BUT
YESTERDAY MY MOM WAS KIND OFWORKING OUT BETTER FOR ME.
>> Jon: OKAY.
DO YOU USE THAT COMPETITION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE?
BECAUSE I COULD THINK THAT WOULD-- I MEAN  --
>> I CAN'T REMEMBER EVER EXCEPTONCE WHEN I WAS LITTLE.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IN THE SUPERMARKET MY MOMSAID I COULDN'T HAVE A TOY.
AND I WALKED OVER TO MY DAD ANDWAS LIKE MOM SAID I COULD HAVE
IT, AND I GOT IT, AND WAS LIKE,OH THAT WORKS GREAT.
THAT'S A THING YOU CAN DO.
>> Jon: THE LESSON THERE IS LIEOUT OF EAR SHOT.
>> YEP. TOTALLY.>> Jon: OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I'M VERYIMPRESSED BY YOU WITH?
IS YOU TAKE MORE CRITICISM, ANDMORE VITRIOLIC CRITICISM THAN
ALMOST ANY PERFORMER AND WRITERI'VE EVER SEEN,
AND YOU HANDLE IT WITHA GRACE THAT BELIES THE
TYPES OF THINGS THAT IS COMEYOUR WAY.
AND I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO FATHOM, BECAUSE I THINK YOUR
WORK IS REALLY SPECIAL, REALLY INTERESTING, REALLY FUNNY.
YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON.
I DON'T GET IT.
DO YOU, DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF IT?
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
I AM, I CALLED GILBERTGOTTFRIED, AND HE OFFERED ME A
LOT OF SUPPORT ABOUT HOW TOHANDLE, YOU KNOW...
>> Jon: YES.
>> LIFE IN THE SPOTLIGHT, AND IFEEL REALLY EQUIPPED NOW.
NO, I, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT CAN DEFINITELY BECHALLENGING.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHENYOU'RE SORT OF YOU KNOW WRITING
IN YOUR ROOM AND DREAMING OFTHIS CAREER THAT YOU NECESSARILY
THINK ABOUT, AS LIKE I'MGOING TO HAVE A TV SHOW,
AND I'M GOING TO WRITE ABOOK AND EVERYONE IS GOING TO
HATE ME IN THE INTERNET.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOUKNOW, IT'S LIKE, IT THIS DOUBLE
EDGED SWORD OF LIKE YOU HAVETHIS GIFT OF PEOPLE PAYING
SERIOUS ATTENTION TO YOUR WORK,AND I FEEL SO LUCKY
ABOUT THAT, AND IT'S GIVEN METHIS SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN
MY LIFE THAT I NEVERIMAGINED I'D HAVE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO I HAVE, IF I HAVE TO KINDOF TAKE THE BAD WITH THE GOOD,
I TRY TO REACT. MY, MY MOTTOWOULD BE,
I TRY TO REACT WITH CLASS AND ALITTLE BIT OF SASS.
I HAVEN'T TESTED THAT ONE OUT ON ANYONE YET.
>> Jon: THAT RHYMES, SO I WOULDGO WITH THAT.
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE GONE WITHDOUBLE GUNS. I WOULD HAVE GONE
WITH JUST LIKE A PICTURE ON THEINTERNET OF ME JUST LIKE BOOM!
>> THERE HAVE DEFINITELY BEENTIMES WHEN I'VE BEEN TEMPTED.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT I KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'TALSO ELICIT THE DESIRED RESULT,
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN YOU END UP LOOKINGLIKE THIS LIKE CRAZY GNOME
THROWING ROCKS OUT OF A CAVEAT THE CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE.
AND I CAN'T DO THAT.
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOUSOMETHING THOUGH?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT SHOULD BE YOUR NEXT SHOW. JUST CALL IT GNOMES.
AND IT'S JUST GNOMES.
>> THERE'S THIS CLASSY SASSYGNOME WHO JUST THROWS STUFF OUT
OF A CAVE.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT!
BUT IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOUALSO, YOU CHART THAT GROWTH.
WHEN I WATCH THE SHOW, IN SOMERESPECTS, YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING A VERSION OF -- A LESS ACTUALIZED
VERSION OF YOU.
>> WELL THAT SORT OF, I ALWAYSSORT OF -- THANK YOU AGAIN.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT I ALWAYS SORT OF THINK OFMY CHARACTER ON THE SHOW AS
BEING SORT OF ME, LIKE TWO AND AHALF YEARS BEHIND.
>> Jon: OH OKAY.>> SO IT'S FUN. I'M LIKE GETTING
TO SAY, LIKE TO SAY ALL THESTUFF I WISH I'D SAID IN
THE MOMENT, AND HANDLE THE SITUATION SLIGHTLY BETTER.
WHICH MEANS THAT I -- IN THEFIRST INSTALLMENT, MUST HAVE
HANDLED THE SITUATION PRETTYBADLY BECAUSE MY CHARACTER
IS A TOTAL ASSHOLE. BUT I REALLY-- I LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SORT OF LIKE GOBACK AND AS YOU SAID,
DO THE POST MORTEM ON THE THINGSI'VE BEEN THROUGH.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I GOT TO DO IT ON THE SHOW.THE BOOK IS A REALLY DIFFERENT
WAY OF GOING ABOUT THATBECAUSE YOU GET TO HAVE THIS
REALLY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPWITH THE PAGE, AND THIS SORT OF
LIKE FIRST PERSON NARRATION ANDYOU CAN TALK ABOUT MOTIVATIONS,
IN A WAY THAT IT WOULDN'T REALLYBE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO STOP
IN THE MIDDLE "GIRLS" AND BELIKE, AND THEN I LEARNED,
BUT -- IN A BOOK,CAN YOU DO THAT.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT WAS "SEX &THE CITY" I THINK.
THEY JUST HAD SOMEBODY TYPETHAT.
>> AND "SEX & THE CITY," THEYDID IT SO EFFECTIVELY, AND WITH
SO MANY PUNS THAT I --
>> Jon: WITH SASS AND CLASS.
>> YEAH. WITH SASS AND CLASS.
>> Jon: YES, WELL, IT'S, IT'SEXCELLENT.
I WISH YOU NOTHING BUT THE BEST.
I MEAN, THIS IS, IT'S ATERRIFIC PIECE MUCH  WORK.
