>> WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
I'M STILL HERE,
UNFORTUNATELY, FOR JON
STEWART WHO IS CURRENTLY
ATTEMPTING TO BREAK THE
WORLD RECORD FOR SMASHING
THE MOST WATERMELONS WITH
HIS HEAD IN UNDER TWO
MINUTES.
HE'S--
(LAUGHTER)
ES HE'S GOOD.
HE SPENT THE TIME WELL.
MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR OF A
NEW BOOK ABOUT THE LIFE OF
RIPLY'S BELIEVE IF OR NOT
CREATOR ROBERT RIPLY NEAL
THOMPSON IS HERE.
BUT BEFORE WE LEFT LAST WEEK
WE DISCUSSED HOW RIDICULOUS
IT WAS THAT THE 2016
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
SPECULATION HAD ALREADY
BEGUN.
COULD IT BE HILL ROE
CLINTON, PROBABLY.
COULD IT BE CHRIS CHRISTIE,
POSSIBLY.
COULD IT BE RAND PAUL,
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT IS NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN.
BUT ALL THIS SPECULATION
LAUNCHED OUR NEW SEGMENT
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST WAIT
UNTIL JON STEWART COMES
BACK.
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, 2016 IS
THREE YEARS AWAY.
AND I'M ONLY HERE FOR TWO
MORE WEEKS.
SO IT IS NOT TOO LONG TO
WAIT.
BUT THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES
JUST KEEP COMING.
>> NEXT PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION IS NEARLY THREE AND
A HALF YEARS AWAY BUT
SENATOR CRUZ'S TRAVEL
ITINERARY LOOKS MORE LIKE A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAN
A FRESHMAN SENATOR.
>> WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
ARE YOU RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT?
>> JOHN, WE ARE HAVING A
NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT WHICH
DIRECTION THE COUNTRY SHOULD
GO.
>> YOU WERE BORN IN CANADA.
COULD YOU-- ARE YOU EVEN
ELIGIBLE TO BE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
>> MY MOTHER IS BORN IN
DELAWARE, SHE IS A U.S.
CITIZEN SO I'M A U.S.
CITIZEN BY BIRTH.
>> THAT SHOULDN'T BE A
PROBLEM THEN.
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW
REPUBLICANS ARE NOTHING IF
NOT UNDERSTANDING ON THAT
PARTICULAR ISSUE.
AS LONG AS YOUR MOTHER WAS
BORN IN THE UNITED STATES,
YOU COULD BE BORN ANYWHERE
ON EARTH AND BE COMPLETELY
ACCEPTED AS A VIABLE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
OKAY.
SO CRUZ IS KIND OF IN.
OR HE REALLY LOVES SPENDING
TIME IN IOWA SO HE'S
DEFINITELY IN.
ANYONE ELSE?
>> ARE YOU LAYING THE
GROUNDWORK NOW FOR 2016.
>> I'M OPEN TO LOOKING AT A
PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN 2016
BUT GOT A LITTLE WAYS, GOT
ELECTIONS IN 2014.
>> AH, SEND YOUR SWEATER
VEST.
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO
RUN AGAIN BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO FRESHEN UP YOUR CAMPAIGN
A BIT.
HOW ABOUT THIS TIME YOU ONLY
WEAR SWEATER SLEEVES.
>> YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A
CLOSET FULL SOMEWHERE.
THAT IS FISCALLY
RESPONSIBLE.
NOW AT THIS POINT YOU ARE
PROBABLY THINKING THE CLOWN
CAR IS FULL.
BUT--
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S THE THING ABOUT
CLOWN CARS.
JUST REMEMBER, THE LEGENDARY
LIST OF CANDIDATES THERE
2012.
MANY OF WHOM, LEAD IN THE
POLLS AT ONE POINT.
REMEMBER HERRMANN CAIN ONCE
LEAD IN THE POLLS.
DID HE HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL
OF BECOMING PRESIDENT?
AND PLEASE ANSWER IN GERMAN.
>> NINE, NINE, NINE.
>> WHY DANKA.
DANKA SHUN.
SO FRANKLY THE REPUBLICANS
BETTER HAVE SOMETHING PRETTY
SPECIAL UP THEIR SLEEVE IF
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND
BEAT WHAT THEY DID LAST
TIME.
>> DONALD TRUMP LAST WEEK
CONFIRMED THE NATIONAL
REVIEW THAT HE IS AGAIN
CONSIDERING A RUN IN 2016.
>> DO IT.
JUST DO IT.
LOOK AT THIS.
DO IT.
I WILL PERSONALLY WRITE YOU
A CAMPAIGN CHECK NOW ON
BEHALF OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH
DOES NOT WANT YOU TO BE
PRESIDENT BUT WH
