[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS
PLAYING OUR FIRST WORLD CUP
MATCH AGAINST OUR FRENEMIES
ACROSS THE POND ENGLAND.
NO ONE IS MORE EXCITED THAN OUR
VERY OWN JOHN OLIVER.

>> EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE
BIG GAME ON SATURDAY.
>> THE AMERICANS WILL TAKE ON
ONE OF TOURNAMENTS FAVORITES,
ENGLAND.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ENGLAND.
THE COUNTRY THAT LIVES AND
BREATHES THE SPORT, HOME OF
PREMIERE LEAGUE.
WE LITERALLY INVENTED THE GAME.
AND ON JUNE 12, WE'LL FACE OFF
AGAINST THE U.S.A., THE CLOWN
COLLEGE OF FOOTBALL SOX WHEN I
WAS GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF
REPORTING FROM THE U.S. WORLD
CUP TRAINING CAMP.
I APPROACHED IT WITH THE
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF REFERENCE.
I'M HERE WITH THE MAGNIFICENT
U.S. --
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY, I'LL TRY AGAIN.
UNITED STATES SOCCER --

[LAUGHTER]
>> JOHN?
>> I GOT IT.
I'M HERE WITH THE UNITED STATES
SOCCER TEAM.
THERE WE GO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> STILL THEY HAD TECHNICALLY
QUALIFIED FOR THIS WORLD CUP AND
DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH
RESPECT.
>> A CHANCE TO PLAY ENGLAND IN
THE FIRST GAME IS AWESOME.
>> DO YOU HAVE A POSITIVE
MIND-SET GOING INTO THE GAME?
>> DEFINITELY?
>> WHY, WHY DO YOU HAVE A
POSITIVE MIND-SET WHEN YOU ARE
STARING INTO THE ABYSS OF
INEVITABLE DEFEAT.
>> THERE ARE NO EASY GAMES IN
FOOTBALL NAME APART FROM THE
U.S. AND YOU NEVER GET TO PLAY
YOURSELF.
IS THAT FAIR?
OF COURSE BEING AN AMERICAN
SOCCER PLAYER PRESENTS ITS OWN
UNIQUE CHALLENGES.
HOW DID YOU TELL YOUR PAR
PARENTS YOU WANTED TO BE AN
AMERICAN SOCCER PLAYER.
>> IT WAS EASY.
THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE.
>> YOUR DAD WAS SAYING, PLEASE,
SON, TELL ME YOU ARE GAY.
>> THAT'S NOW -- NOT
HOW.CONVERSATION WENT.
>> YOU HAVEN'T (bleep) TOLD
THEM YET.
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE TO TAKE THE
BOLD STEP.
LOOK IN THE CAMERA AND SAY, MOM,
I'M A U.S. IS SOCCER PLAYER.
>> MOM, I'M A U.S. SOCCER.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CALL THEM
BEFORE THIS GOES OUT THOUGH,
YEAH.
TO SAVE THEM FROM FURTHER
HUMILIATION, I DECIDED TO TEACH
THEM BASIC FUNDAMENTALS.
THIS IS CALLED JUGGLING.
ONE AND ONE.
YOU TRY IT.
>> ONE, --
>> NO NOT LIKE THAT.
HOLD ON, NO, NO, NO, THAT'S NOT
IT.
DON'T OVER COMPLICATE IT.
GIVE ME THE BALL.
YOU GIVE ME THE BALL.
STOP IT.
GIVE ME THAT.
LEAVE IT ALONE.
SO THEY CAN DO CIRCUS TRICKS,
THAT HARDLY MAKES THEM REAL
FOOTBALLERS.
JUST TO BE CERTAIN THIS WAS
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT I WENT TO
A U.S. WORLD CUP WARM UP MATCH.
THERE WERE A FEW MORE FANS THAN
I WAS EXPECTED AND THEY WERE
PLAYING AT A SURPRISINGLY HIGH
LEVEL.
>> ENGLAND SUCKS!
>> THEY'VE HAD THEIR FUN BUT NOW
THEY'LL BE PLAYING AN ACTUAL
EUROPEAN TEAM, THE CZECH
REPUBLIC.
THIS OUGHT TO BE HILARIOUS.
OKAY.
ONE NICE DROP, BIG DEAL.
AND A PRETTY GOOD ONE DOWN THE
LINE.
WHOA, NICE THROUGH BALL.
OKAY.
HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO
THAT.
WHAT THE (bleep) IS GOING ON?
OKAY, ONE LUCKY GOAL, LET'S NOT
GET CARRIED AWAY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG.
WITH THE ENGLAND GAME OR THE
HORIZON, I HEADED BACK TO CAMP
KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO
DO.
I'LL TELL WHAT YOU YOU MUST DO
IN SOUTH AFRICA, A MIDNIGHT
STROLL WEAR AS MUCH EXPENSIVE
JEWELRY AS YOU CAN.
APPARENTLY A DELICACY IS RIVER
WATER.
DRINK GALLONS OF GALLONS OF
UNFILTERED RIVER WATER.
ALSO THEY NEEDED TO LEARN THE
LOCAL LANGUAGE.
I HAVE A FEW PHRASES YOU'LL
NEED.
THAT'S GREAT.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> IT MEANS IT'S A PLEASURE AND
AN HONOR TO BE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS I HAVE A
HEARTFELT MESSAGE FOR MY ADOPTED
COUNTRY.
JOKING APART, THE U.S.A. IS MY
HOME FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.
I'M A HUGE FOOTBALL FAN.
I WANT TO WISH YOU THE BEST.
GOOD LUCK.
ALL THE BEST.
LET ME BE CLEAR IT'S NOT STUART
HOLDEN OR THE ENTIRE U.S.
FOOTBALL TEAM THAT CAN SUCK IT
AS FAR AS THIS REPORTER IS
CONCERNED COME JUNE THE 12th
IT'S ALL OF YOU, IT'S AMERICA.
YOU CAN ALL GO SUCK IT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER.
TUNE IN MONDAY, JOHN
