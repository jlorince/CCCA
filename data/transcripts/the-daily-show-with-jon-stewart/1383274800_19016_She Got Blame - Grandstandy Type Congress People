ARE WE REALLY GOING TO SPENDTHREE HOURS OF HAVING PRODUCTIVE
DISCOURSE?
>> THERE IS A FAMOUS MOVIECALLED "THE WIZARD OF OZ" --
>> Stewart: WHOA!  DO GO ON.
>> IN "THE WIZARD OF OZ" THEREIS A GREAT LINE, DOROTHY, AT
SOME POINT IN THE MOVIE TURNS TOHER LITTLE DOG TOTO AND SAYS,
TOTO, WE ARE NOT IN KANSASANYMORE.

KANSAS ANYMORE.
>> Stewart: LET ME JUST STOPYOU RIGHT THERE.

>> Stewart: FOR THE LOVE OFGOD!
>> AND PEOPLE WENT TO SEE THEWIZARD BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL
THINGS HE DID.
AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ISDOING A LOT OF GREAT THINGS IN
IOWA.
>> Stewart: YOU ARE REALLYGOING TO USE THE WIZARD TO
DEFEND YOUR PROGRAM TO SAY HOWGREAT IT IS?  DID YOU WATCH THE
MOVIE?  THE WIZARD IS A CHARLATAN
HE IS A TWO BIT HUCKSTER WHONEVER GAVE PEOPLE ANYTHING THEY
DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE ..
SO FOR THE MOST PART THE HEARINGWAS SUBSTANTIVE WITH A
SMATTERING OF SILLY, THATDOESN'T MEAN THERE WAS NOBODY
THERE JUST TO FILL THE NEXTCAMPAIGN AD LIKE CORY GARDNER
WHO SPENT THE FIRST TWO HOURS OFTHE HEARING DRINKING RED BULL
AND SNORTING COFFEE GROUNDS TOWAIT HIS TURN.

LAW AND IN CHARGE OF THIS LAWSHOULD YOU BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN
THE OTHER AMERICANS OUT THEREWHO ARE LOSING THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE?

HEALTHCARE IF I HAVE AFFORDABLEWORK COVERAGE IN MY WORKPLACE I
AM NOT ELIGIBLE TO GO INTO THEMARKETPLACE.
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO BEJUST LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND ENTER THE EXCHANGE AND AGREETO FIND A WAY TO DO THAT.
I DON'T CARE.
>> IT IS ILLEGAL.
>> Stewart: DID YOU HEAR HER? IT IS ILLEGAL.
DOESN'T STOP HIM.
WELL, BREAK THE LAW!  IENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHOBREAK THE LAW EVERY DAY.
THAT WAS SOME IMPRESSIVEGRANDSTANDING POPULIST NONSENSE,
YOUNG MAN,DELIVERED WITH PASSION, BUT
LET THIS MISSOURI CONGRESSMANTELL YOU HOW NOT TO TAKE NO
HYPOTHETICALS FOR AN ANSWER.
>> IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TOGO INTO THE EXCHANGE, LIKE ALL
OF THESE MILLIONS OF AMERICANSTHAT ARE GOING TO THE EXCHANGES,
WILL YOU COMMIT TO FOREGO YOURGOVERNMENT INSURANCE PLAN YOU

>> SIR, THE WAY THE LAW ISWRITTEN --
>> IT IS A YES OR NO. LET'S SAYYOU ARE WRONG ON THAT.
YES OR NO, IF YOU ARE WRONG -->> I DON'T WANT TO --
>> Stewart: MADAM SECRETARY,AR, AR, A R, THE LET'S SAY

MADAM SECRETARY, I YIELD MYTIME.
OF COURSE THE MASTER OFANTI-OBAMACARE GRANDSTANDING,
TENNESSEE CONGRESSMAN MARCIABLACKBURN NO MATTER HOW (BLEEP)
AN INSURANCE PLANIS, SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT.
>> HOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MARK &LUCINDA, THEY LIKED THE PLAN, IT
WAS AFFORDABLE AND LIKED IT BUTIT IS BEING TERMINATED AND NOW
THEY DO NOT HAVE HEALTHINSURANCE?
>> I WILL REMIND YOU, SOMEPEOPLE LIKE TO DRIVE A FORD, NOT
A FERRARI AND SOME PEOPLE LIKETO DRINK OUT OF A RED SOLO CUP
AND NOT A CRYSTAL STEM, YOU ARETAKING AWAY THEIR CHOICE.
>> Stewart: I BELIEVE INCHOICE EXCEPT IN MARRIAGE AND
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BUT ACTUALLYYOU KNOW, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT
IT, HOLD ON.
LET ME JUST -- REALLY, IACTUALLY ONLY BELIEVE IN CUP OR
CAR CHOICE, THAT'S IT.
IT IS JUST THOSE TWO.
BUT, IT IS HARDLY SURPRISINGTHAT BLACKBURN CAME TO THE
HEARING WITH A WITTY LINEPREPARED LIKE THAT.
SHE HAS BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TOTHIS HEARING FOR A WHILE.
>> THE MORE WE HEARD TODAY, THEMORE QUESTIONS WE HAD, SO WE
WILL BE READY FOR SECRETARYSEBELIUS WHEN SHE COMES BEFORE
US NEXT WEEK.
>> WE WANT HER TO TALK WITH USBEFORE SHE IS OUT THE DOOR.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.
>> SHE HAS GOT TIME FOR JONSTEWART AND "THE DAILY SHOW" BUT
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO COME TOTHOSE OF US WHO ARE TASKED WITH
OVERSEEING THIS.
>> Stewart: (BLEEP) TO DO WITHTHIS?  WHAT?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> Stewart: I AM JUST TRYING
TO -- HUH?  KATHLEEN SEBELIUSCHOSE TO COME HERE, IT WAS HER
CHOICE.
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO GO BEFORECONGRESS AND DRINK OUT OF A RED
SOLO -- FREEDOM HATER!  SEEMSLIKE BLACKBURN HAS A LOT OF
QUESTIONS FOR SEBELIUS,HOPEFULLY THREE HOURS WILL BE
ENOUGH TIME.
THE CONGRESSWOMAN TO GET ALL THEINFORMATION SHE SO DESPERATELY
-- WAIT, SHE IS GETTING UP.
THAT IS WEIRD.
10:21 SHE IS GETTING UP AND ISSHE LEAVING?  OH, MY GOD SHE IS
WALKING OUT OF THE ROOM, IS SHEGOING BACK TO RESEARCH SOME
INSURANCE FACTS PERHAPS TOREFILL
HER RED SOLO CUP?  JOINING USNOW IS REPRESENTATIVE MARCIA
BLACKBURN WHO WAS IN THEHEARING, ASKED SOME TERRIFIC
QUESTIONS.
SHE JOINS US NOW FROM OUR CAMERARIGHT THERE ON CAPITOL HILL.
>> Stewart: NOT A PROBLEM ATALL, STEWART, HAPPY TO BE HERE.
>> YOU ARE NOT INTERRUPTINGANYTHING.
>> WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TELLTHE TINY AMOUNT OF AMERICANS WHO
WATCH FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ITCOULDN'T WAIT UNTIL THE HEARING
YOU DEMANDED WAS OVER?
>> SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BESIPPING CHARDONNAY FROM A
CRYSTALSTEM, THEY WANT BEER FROM A
RED SOLO CUP, YOU KNOW.
IT IS A CHOICE.
>> Stewart: RED SOLO CUP!  WEWILL BE RIGHT BACK.
