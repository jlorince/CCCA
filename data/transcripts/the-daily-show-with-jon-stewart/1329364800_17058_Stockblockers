>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT REPRESENTATIVE
LOUISE SLAUGHTER WILL BE HERE
VIA SATELLITE.
SATELLITE.
THAT'S RIGHT, SPACE.
(LAUGHTER)
OOH.
HAPPY OH MY GOD YESTERDAY WAS
VALENTINE'S DAY (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S THE DAY WHEN YOU REMEMBER
THAT YESTERDAY WAS VALENTINE'S
DAY.
AND NOW YOU'RE ALONE.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
STATE OF OUR CAPITAL MARKET.
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT
OF REQUESTS ON THE SHOW TO DO
MORE CAPITAL MARKETS BITS.
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH A BIT OF A
ROUGH PATCH.
REPUTATIONS HAVE SUFFERED.
NOT LEAST OF WHICH DUE TO A RASH
OF INSIDER TRADING.
WE KNOW INSIDER TRADING IS BAD.
WHY ELSE WOULD JOHN CRYER'S DEAD
BROTHER HAVE GONE TO JAIL IN
THAT '80s MOVIE.
YOU KNOW, THE MOVIE ABOUT...
WALL STREET.
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF
THAT MOVIE.
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT
WAS NOT TOLERATED.
>> GOLDMAN SACHS TECHNOLOGY
ANALYST IS REPORTED UNDER
INVESTIGATION BY FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES FOR LEAKING INSIDE
INFORMATION TO HEDGE FUNDS.
>> Jon: GOOD!
(LAUGHTER)
I'M GLAD.
NOT THAT HE'S LEAKING.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M GLAD THAT PEOPLE TRADING ON
SECRET INFORMATION WHICH
UNDERMINES THE VERY INTEGRITY OF
OUR MARKETS IS A PROBLEM.
YOU TRADE ON NONPUBLIC
INFORMATION, YOU GET IN TROUBLE.
THAT'S SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD INVESTIGATE.
UNLESS THEY'RE DOING IT.
FOR EXAMPLE, INSIDER TRADING ON
THE STOCK MARKET.
IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS,
THOSE LAWS ARE DEEMED NOT TO
APPLY.
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF FORMS OF
HONEST GRAFTS THAT CONGRESSMEN
ENGAGE IN THAT ALLOW THEM TO
BECOME VERY, VERY WEALTHY.
>> Jon: JUST LIKE THE FOUNDING
FATHERS INTENDED.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND
BALANCES.
THEY T DEPOSIT CHECKS, IT
INCREASES THEIR BALANCES.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK, CONGRESSIONAL TRADING ON
NONPUBLIC INFORMATION IS
SURPRISINGLY COMMON.
"60 MINUTES" REPORTED IN
NOVEMBER FINANCIAL SERVICES
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SPENCER
BACHUS MADE INVESTMENTS AFTER
CLOSED-DOOR BRIEFINGS ON THE
ECONOMY.
JOHN BOEHNER DABBLED IN
INSURANCE STOCKS DURING THE
HEALTH CARE DEBATE AND NANCY
PELOSI TOOK PART IN AN EXCLUSIVE
VISA I.P.O. WHILE CONSIDERING
LEGISLATION ON CREDIT CARDS.
AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
ITTY-BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE ARE
SHORTING THE OVER THE SHOULDER
BOLDER HOLDER MARKET AND HOW IS
THAT NOT ILLEGAL AND HOW DID I
STAY THAT WITHOUT TRIPPING UP ON
THE WORDS?
I DON'T KNOW.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
REALLY?
ARE YOUR STANDARDS FOR ME THAT
LOW?
(LAUGHTER)
THIS GENTLEMAN GOT THROUGH
ITTY-BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE.
I SAY WE CARRY HIM OUT ON OUR
SHOULDERS.
LOOK, THE REPORT ON "60 MINUTES"
MADE SOME REAL WAVES ON CAPITOL
HILL.
MEMBERS VOWED ACTION.
WE MUST MAKE IT UNAMBIGUOUS THAT
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS
ILLEGAL.
>> WE SHOULD NOT BE SHIELDING
CONGRESS FROM LAWS THAT APPLY TO
OTHER AMERICANS.
>> Jon: YES!
CONGRESS SHOULD OBEY THE SAME
LAWS AS EVERYONE ELSE.
I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN THE NO
(BLEEP) SHERLOCK ACT OF 2000 AND
ALWAYS.
THAT'S WHY LAST THURSDAY
CONGRESS PASSED SOMETHING CALLED
THE STOP TRADING ON
CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE, OR
STOCK ACT.
IT'S AN ACRONYM.
IT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT
CONGRESS PEOPLE OR THEIR STAFF
FROM BENEFITING FINANCIALLY FROM
INFORMATION THEY LEARNED IN THE
COURSE OF BEING IN CONGRESS.
SO NOW AT LONG LAST IF YOU'RE ON
THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE YOU
CAN'T TRADE BANK STOCKS.
>> IF YOU'RE ON THE SENATE
BANKING COMMITTEE, YOU'RE GOING
TO STILL BE ABLE TO TRADE BANK
STOCK.
(AUDIENCE REACTS).
(LAUGHTER)
