TRUMP'S COMMENTS CLEARLYCAUGHT ON TAPE.
TRUMP HAD NO CHOICE BUT TORECOGNIZE HE HAD MISSPOKEN AND
TAKE THE HONORABLE WAY OUT.
I'M JUST (BLEEP) WITH YA!
HERE'S WHAT HE DID.
>> WHY DID SAVANNAH START OUT BYSAYING I SAID HE WASN'T A WAR
HERO, I NEVER SAID THAT.
HE WAS A WAR HERO.
SAVANNAH STARTED IT OFF BYSAYING I SAID HE WASN'T A WAR
HERO.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

LET ME JUST LISTEN TO THE TAPEAGAIN REAL QUICK.

LET'S WATCH IT UPSIDE DOWN.,BECAUSE MAYBE I DIDN'T--
>> HE IS NOT A WAR HERO.

SAID HE'S NOT A WAR HERO.
LET ME SEE A LITTLE "SESAMESTREET" VIBE --
>> HE'S NOT A WAR HERO.

"YOU SAID IT"!
SO YOU SAID IT.
>> THE NEXT SENTECE WAS, HE IS AWAR HERO.
I SAID THAT.
BUT THEY NEVER WANT TO PLAY IT,AND YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IT.
IF YOU WOULD HAVE LET IT RUNANOTHER THREE SECONDS, YOU WOULD

HE'S NOTA WAR HERO. HE'S A WARHERO BECAUSE HE WAS CAPTURED.
>> Jon: SO YOU SAID HE'S NOT AWAR HERO.
THE GUY NEXT TO YOU GOES, HE'S AWAR HERO.
AND YOU GO, WELL, HE'S A WARHERO BECAUSE HE GOT CAPTURED.
SO, REALLY, DOES CALLING SOMEONEA WAR HERO COUNT IF YOU'RE DOING
IT SARCASTICALLY?
HE'S NOT A WAR HERO, BUT, ALLRIGHT, HE IS A WAR HERO, FINE,
HE GOT CAPTURED.
WHATEVER.
(APPLAUSE)
BUT, OF COURSE, WHO BETTERTO TALK ABOUT SACRIFICE IN
WARTIME THAN ONE DONALD TRUMP.

ULTIMATELY HAD A MEDICALDEFERMENT BECAUSE OF MY FEET.

(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S THE THING I DON'T GET.
WHY IS ANYONE ACTING SURPRISEDABOUT TRUMP?
THE ONLY THING YOU LIKE HIM ISBECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS
HE'S WILLING TO SAY ABOUT OBAMA.
BUT TRUMP HAS NO CONTROL OVERTHE VOMIT OF DICKISHNESS THAT
COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH EVERYTIME HE OPENS IT.
IT WAS INEVITABLE SOME OF HISWORD-PUKE WAS GOING TO GET ON
YOU!
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT, YOUHAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE!
