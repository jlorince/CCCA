WHO KNOWS WHICH ONE THEY'LL VOICE.
BUT NO, NO, RESIST, RESIST, STAY FOCUSED.
WE'RE DOING IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THAT IS THE ISSUE OUR PRESIDENT
CHOSE TO FOCUS ON JUST AFTER HE FLEW TO PAKISTAN AND KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN WITH HIS BARE HANDS.
IN THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTION SINCE F.D.R. ROLLED OVER HITLER IN A WHEELCHAIR.
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING DOWN, HITLER!
REALLY?
NOBODY WATCHES THE HISTORY CHANNEL?
NOBODY?
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, DON'T.
LISTEN TO BARACK OBAMA IN HIS FIRST NON-BIN LADEN DEATH-RELATED APPEARANCE.
>> WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT TO PASS GENUINE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM.
LOOK AT YOU, SPENDING ALL THAT BIN LADEN CAPITAL ON AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL ISSUE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
>> STOPPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ALSO DEPENDS ON REFORMING OUR OUTDATED SYSTEM OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION.
BUSINESSES HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY EXPLOIT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS SO THAT
THERE'S NO LONGER A MASSIVE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT EXPLOITS A CHEAP SOURCE OF LABOR.
WE NEED TO PROVIDE OUR FARMS A LEGAL WAY TO HIRE WORKERS.
WE SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST.
WE NEED TO PASS THE DREAM ACT.
>> Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF TO DO.
I MEAN, THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE LIST, BUT HERE'S THE THING, ARE
YOU THE "KILL BIN LADEN" OBAMA SAYIN
