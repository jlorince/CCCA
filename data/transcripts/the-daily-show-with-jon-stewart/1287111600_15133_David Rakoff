AUTHOR.

DAVID RAKOFF.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
>> NOT MUCH THANK YOU FOR HAVING
ME.
>> Jon: PLEASE, WHAT HAVE YOU
BROUGHT FOR OUR AUDIENCE TONIGHT
[LAUGHTER]
>> I'VE BEEN EATING SO MUCH
CANDY BACK STAGE THAT I'M ABOUT
TO BURST INTO TEARS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ONCE AGAIN HILARIOUS
BOOK.
THERE'S A WARNING ON THE BOOK:
NO INSPIRATIONAL LIFE LESSONS
WILL BE FOUND IN THESE PAGE.
IT TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE
ACTUALLY.
>> Jon: TELL ME ABOUT THE
PHILOSOPHY OF THE BOOK?
>> THE BOOK IS MEANT TO BE A
DEFENSE OF PESSIMISM, MELAN
COLLIE, ALL OF EMOTIONS A SELF
SELECTING GROUP SHALL WE CAN
JUST CALL THEM JEWS --
[LAUGHTER]
-- MIGHT FEEL IS THEIR SORT OF
BASELINE.
>> Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT
COMING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> THE BASELINE -- THE BASELINE
WAY YOU WOULD SEE THE WORLD
TURNS OUT TO BE AS VALUE NEUTRAL
AS HAVING BRORN BROWN EYES.
OPTIMISM IS BROAD BASED
NONDETAIL ORIENTED THINKING.
>> Jon: I'M PESSIMISTIC BY
NATURE BUT OPTIMISTIC BY FORCE.
I FORCE MYSELF TO GO THROUGH
HISTORY.
I HAVE P, RELL BUT I REALIZE 200
YEARS AGO WE POOPED IN THE WATER
WE DRANK.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: SO I LOOK AT IT --
WHAT I DO IS I DEAL WITH MY OWN
NEUROSES AND TRY TO PLACE THEM.
>> THE ONLY THING THAT GIVES ME
HOPE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THINGS
ARE CYCLICAL.
THAT GIVES ME HOPE.
>> Jon: REALLY?
DON'T YOU THINK PEOPLE IN
ANCIENT TIMES, BUBONIC PLAGUE
THEY DON'T HAVE NEUROROTTIC
PEOPLE THEN.
I MIGHT GET THE TYPHOID.
NEUROSES IS A LUXURY TO SOME
EXTENT.
>> I THINK THE MORE PESSIMISTIC
PEOPLE STAYED ILLUMINATING
MANUSCRIPTS OR MAKING
TELESCOPES.
>> Jon: TO MAKE SURE THERE
WERE NO ASTROIDS GOING TO HIT
US.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: WAS YOUR WORLD VIEW IN
ANY WAY VALID DATED AS YOU WERE
THIS -- THIS PESSIMISTIC WORLD
THROUGH THIS WILL MELAN ALCOHOLY
DID -- MEL ANDCHOLY.
>> MY EDITOR SAID YOU SEEM TO
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ACCESSION
PLEASURE OR FEELING JOY.
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ABOUT THAT.
THE BOOK WAS UNDERWAY AND IT WAS
LATE FOR A LONG TIME.
I HAD A PINCHED NERVE IN MY ARM
SOEUFS LIKE TWO YEARS -- SO I
WAS TWO YEARS LATE.
MY EDITOR WAS SYMPATHETIC TO A
POINT BUT IT WAS A PINCHED NERVE
MY ARM WAS ON FIRE FOR TWO
YEARS.
TURNS OUT A TUMOR WAS PINCHING
MY NERVE.
IT WAS GREAT THOUGH --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: CAN I JUST SAFER THAT
THOSE TWO SENTENCES JUSM AT THAT
POSES.
IT WAS A TUMOR BUT IT WAS GREAT.
>> IF YOU WRITE ABOUT LOOK AT
THE WORLD IN ALL OF ITS FLINTY
AFFLICTED DARK REALITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE ULTIMATE MONEY WHERE WRUR
MOUTH IS MOST REALLY MR. SMART
GUY, MR. NEGATIVE, MR. I FEEL SO
BAD, BOOM, TUMOR.
[LAUGHTER]
SO IT AT LEAST --
[LAUGHTER]
SO THAT POINT YOU CAN TO YOUR
EDITOR AND GO, I TOLD YOU SO.
>> EXACTLY.
SO THE BOOK WAS REALLY LATE
BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE THEN I
HAD RADIATION AND SURGERY AND
CHEMO.
>> Jon: TO ME, AGAIN, YOU LOOK
GREAT.
YOU LOOK HEALTHY AND VITAL.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
>> I FEEL FINE.
I'M CURRENTLY IN CHEMOTHERAPY.
>> Jon: RIGHT NOW.
>> NOT IMMEDIATELY RIGHT NOW BUT
YES.
>> Jon: RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK
YOU ARE HAVING CHEMO?
THIS IS WHAT I WONDER ABOUT SORT
OF OLD WELL WOODY ALLEN CONNUMB
DRUM PEOPLE THAT WORRY, WHEN
THEY HAPPEN --
>> >> A RELIEF?
>> Jon: YES.
>> YES, IT'S LIKE WAITING FOR
RAIN AND THEN IT RAINS.
AH.
KINDS OF.
>> Jon: DO YOU GO I BET IT
TURNS IN A TORNADO.
WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT?
>> HERE IS THE THING:  WHEN IT
TURNS OUT TO BE YOUR OWN
MORTALITY ON THE LINE PEOPLE
TEND TO BE QUITE OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT THEIR LONG-TERM CHANCES OF
SURVIVAL.
THE WILL TO KEEP ON GOING IS
INCREDIBLY STRONG.
I DO FEEL -- THEREFORE DOES IT
EXTEND TO OPTIMISM ABOUT THE
ROBERTS COURT?
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU FEEL LIKE THE
CANCER YOU CAN TAKE CARE, THE
ROBERTS COURT --
>> CITIZENS UNITED WE'RE JUST
COMPLETELY SCREWED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THAT HAS MIDWEST TAFT
SIZED -- MA TAFT SIDES.
>> PRECISELY.
>>.
>> Jon: DO YOU LIKE YOUR
CAREGIVERS?
THEY THEY PUMP YOU UP?
>> THEY DON'T.
THEY RECOGNIZE ME FOR WHAT AND
WHO I AM.
THERE WAS A STUDY THAT SHOWS
THAT THE LONG-TERM MORTALITY
WITH PEOPLE WITH LOUSY ATTITUDES
IS NO DIFFERENT THAN PEOPLE WITH
GREAT ATTITUDES.
YOU CAN BE THE WORST BASTARD ON
THE WARD AND YOU WILL NOT DIE AT
ANY GREATER RATE THAN OTHERS.
PEOPLE WILL SIMPLY BE GLADDER
WHEN YOU DO.
[LAUGHTER]
ALL THAT POSITIVE OUTLOOK I'M
NOT -- ALL OF THAT SORT OF I'M
GOING TO CHEMOTHERAPY IN MY
SKY-HIGH JIMMY CHOO, CRAZY SEXY
CANCER.
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT, IF YOU
CAN'T ENACT A SEX IN THE CITY
EPISODE ON YOUR WAY, IF YOU FEEL
LOUSY ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT YOUR
FAULT.
I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THAT.
IT'S BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT
VICTIMY TO ME.
>> Jon: THAT'S AN INTERESTING
TAKE ON IT.
WHEN YOU ARE A BASTARD YOU ARE
REQUIRING -- YOU ARE CALLING
UPON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS.
THERE'S THE NURSE COMING IN --
>> YOU WILL GET BED SORES.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S GIVE HIM A SPONGE BADGE
WITH THE BRILLOWS.
>> YOUR ROOM WILL SMELL LIKE A
HOBO CAMP.
BELIEVE ME.
>> Jon: THAT HAS TO BE YOUR
NEXT BOOK.
>> IT IS.
>> Jon: YOUR ROOM WILL SMELL
LIKE A HOBO CAMP.
I'M PLEASED TO SEE YOU LOOKING
SO GOOD AND BEING SO SHARP.
>> THANKS, MAN.
>> Jon: ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE
YOU.
HALF EMPTY IS ON THE BOOKSHEL
