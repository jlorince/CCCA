OF COURSE HE'LL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.
HALF TIME ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME.
WHAT ABOUT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE?
WHAT ABOUT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE LIKE AFTER THE AURORA SHOOTING S WHEN THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK
CALLED FOR AN EXAMINATION OF GUN LAWS?
>> THE BODY IS NOT EVEN OUT OF THE THEATER BEFORE HE STARTED TO JUMP INTO THIS DEBATE.
I THINK THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF POLITICAL PROTOCOL THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IN A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS
WHERE YOU WAIT.
BE QUIET FOR 24 HOURS AT LEAST.
>> Jon: THAT'S CLEARLY IN THAT SITUATION IT'S NOT WHERE IT IS BEING DISCUSSED BUT WHEN.
I'M ASSUMING THAT THE VENUE WAS GOOD.
IT'S JUST THAT THE MAYOR DID NOT OBEY THE COMMON SENSE WAITING PERIOD WE PLACE ON GUN...
AMMMM... CONVERSATIONS.
YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY IN AN EMOTIONAL STATE JUST SHOOTING OFF THEIR MOUTHS ABOUT GUNS.
IT'S NOT JUST THE WHERE AND THE WHEN OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.
IT'S THE WHO
>> IS THIS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR AT HALF TIME?
SPORTSCASTER BOB COSTAS LECTURING FOOTBALL FANS -- THAT MEANS YOU -- ABOUT GUN CONTROL?
>> MR. COSTAS, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
STICK TO THE AREA THAT YOU'RE REALLY SMART ABOUT WHICH IS SPORTS.
I WROTE A BOOK CALLED SHUT UP AND SING.
THIS WOULD BE SHUT UP AND COMMENT ON SPORTS.
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT BOB COSTAS THINKS ABOUT GUNS
>> Jon: BUT WHY DO YOU GET TO TALK?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO DISRESPECT, I DON'T MUCH CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING.
YET WHENEVER I TURN ON THE TV, YOU'RE THERE TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING.
THAT'S A SUBJECT OF MY BOOK: SHUT UP AND SHUT UP.
SO CLEARLY...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT ONE WAS EASY.
CLEARLY SPORTS COMMENTATORS THEY DON'T GET TO COMMENT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND SINGERS DON'T GET
TO COMMENT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE EITHER.
RIGHT, BOB?
>> TED NUGENT ISSUED A QUOTE SAYING WE THOUGHT BOB COSTAS WAS SMARTER THAN THAT.
ONLY FOOLS BLAME TOOLS INSTEAD OF HUMAN FAILINGS.
>> Jon: HOW COME THAT GUY DOESN'T HAVE TO SHUT UP AND SING?
OR SHUT UP AND WHATEVER IT IS THAT HE DOES.
I'M BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT THE RULES THOUGH.
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GHOUL VIOLENCE, GUN CULTURE, GUN CONTROL YOU HAVE TO BE A GUN
EXPERT NOT JUST A SPORTS CAST OR AMUSE I CANNIAN.
EVEN THE RIGHT PERSON CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT TOO SOON AFTER A TRAGEDY.
DISRESPECTFUL.
HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO SAY THERE SHOULD BE MORE GUNS AFTER A TRAGEDY?
LIKE THE SHOOTING IN OSLO.
>> YOU HAVE 600 PEOPLE THERE ON THAT ISLAND, AND THE SECURITY PROCEDURES THAT WERE THERE WERE
NOT NONEFFECTIVE.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN, YOU DON'T HAVE SECURITY.
I HAVE A BIG LAUGH WHEN THEY ASK ME FOR SECURITY GUARDS BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE A GUN.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE SECURITY WITH A GUN THEN YOU'RE NOT HAVING SECURITY.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE THING ABOUT THESE NORWEGIANS.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH YOU NEED GUNS.
IT'S A HARPOON CULTURE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?
THEY SHOOT WHALES.
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT [BLEEP].
THAT WAS ABOUT THE MASS KILLING IN NORWAY.
BUT AT LEAST THEY RESPECTFULLY WAITED UNTIL 48 HOURS AFTERWARDS.
IN FACT, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR GUN CULTURE, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
YOU'RE BEING TASTEFUL IN RESPECTING THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
OF COURSE IF YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION...
>> THIS GUY IS SIX-FOUR, 320, HE COULD HAVE KILLED HER WITH HIS BARE HANDS
>> BELCHER KILLED HER I GUESS COSTAS DOES NOT THINK BELCHER IS STRONG ENOUGH TO
ASPHYXIATE HIS GIRLFRIEND OR SMART ENOUGH TO HOOK UP A HOSE INTO HIS GARAGE AND KILL HER
THROUGH ASPHYXIATION
>> LOOK AT O.J. SIMPSON.
HE WENT OVER THERE WITH A KNIFE.
MURDERED HIS EX-WIFE AND HER FRIEND.
>> WAS SHE KILLED WITH A GUN OR WITH A KNIFE?
>> Jon: YEAH.
KNIFE, KNIFE, KNIFE, KNIFE!
NICOLE SIMPSON WAS MURDERED WITH A KNIFE.
DOES COSTAS WANT TO BAN KNIVES BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE TO CUT STEAK WITH OUR GUN AND THAT
WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
STI, I THINK I GET THE RULES NOW.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE RULES.
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT GUNS JUST NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE WAKE OF ANY EVENT INVOLVING GUNS.
WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 GUN-RELATED MURDERS DAILY IN THE UNITED STATES WHEN WILL IT EVER
BE THE RIGHT TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES?
>> A RARE MOMENT IN NEW YORK CITY.
POLICE SAY THERE WERE NO REPORTED SLAYINGS, STABBINGS, SHOOTINGORS OR KNIFINGS DURING A
36-HOUR PERIOD FROM SUNDAY NIGHT UNTIL TUESDAY MORNING.
SNIEM THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO.
WE MISSED OUR [BLEEP] WINDOW.
WHY RUIN THE CELEBRATION?
WE'LL BE RIGHT
