STILL GOT IT.
LOOK, LITTLE MESSAGE TO THE G.S.A., YOU DON'T WANT TO SCREW WITH THE GOVERNMENT.
ARE YOU FORGETTING WHAT HAPPENED WHEN GOOGLE TRIED TO STOLE WALL THESE MANIACS?
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GOOGLE CASE, YOU COULD ALWAYS...
(LAUGHTER).
REMEMBER?
>> GOOGLE IS COMING UNDER FIRE IN A NEW BATTLE OVER PRIVACY.
>> GOOGLE'S FACING HEAT FOR ITS PREVIOUS PROGRAM.
GOOGLE ALSO GOT ACCESS TO E-MAILS, PASSWORDS, INTERNET USAGE HISTORY USING UNSECURED
WI-FI FETE WORK ACCESS.
>> Jon: GOOGLE, I AM SHOCKED.
YOU STOLE PEOPLE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION?
THAT IS FACEBOOK'S JOB!
(LAUGHTER) THE F.C.C. INVESTIGATED THESE SHENANIGANS AND THAT'S WHEN (BLEEP) GOT REAL.
>> THE F.C.C. SAYING THEY WANTED TO KNOW FROM GOOGLE WHO ARE THE
EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE ENGINEERING OF THIS AND WHAT TEAMS WERE THEY WORKING ON AND
WHAT SORT OF CORRESPONDENTS?
GOOGLE SAYING BASICALLY WE DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT.
>> Jon: OH!
OH!
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY YOU SHOULD JUST PUT THAT INFORMATION ON GOOGLE+ BECAUSE...
(LAUGHTER).
NOBODY WILL EVER!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COME AND GET ME GOOGLE!
YEAH, GOOGLE, WHAT'S UP?
YEAH, I'M A LYCOS MAN.
ALTAVISTA?
WHAT?
I GUESS I'M OLD IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
GOOGLE, GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO COME DOWN ON YOU LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.
I HOPE YOU GOT DISASTER INSURANCE BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET TORE UP.
>> THE F.C.C. DID SLAP A FINE ON GOOGLE OF $25,000 FOR FAILING TO
RESPOND TO THEIR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.
>> Jon: BOOM!
25 LARGE!
THAT'S... NOTHING.
(LAUGHTER) FOR GOOGLE.
GOOGLE MAKES $25,000 IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK KNOW SAY THE WORDS "TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS." THEY WON'T COOPERATE WITH AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THE INADVERTENT-- OR NOT--
COLLECTING OF CITIZENS' PERSONAL DATA AND THE FINE IS LESS THAN WHAT YOU WOULD GET FOR A
PARTICULARLY FLASHY N.F.L.
TOUCHDOWN DANCE.
(LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, WE WOULD SHOW YOU FOOTAGE OF SOMEONE DOING AN N.F.L. TOUCHDOWN DANCE BUT THE
N.F.L. WOULD CHARGE US MORE THAN $25,000 TO DO THAT.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE THE N.F.L. RUN THESE INQUIRIES.
LOOK, COMICALLY LOW FINES ASIDE,
OOGLE AND JEFF NEELY BETTERG CHECK THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY WRECK THEMSELVES.
THEY'RE ASKING FAR DATE WITH THE A.G., THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
NATION'S TOP PROSECUTOR, OUR LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.
NO STONEWALL JACKSON IS WHAT THEY CALL HIM.
YOU GO IN FRONT OF THAT GUY...
LOOK HOW HE BACKED UP CONGRESS WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE A.T.F.'S
FAST AND FURIOUS MEXICAN GUN RUNNING SCANDAL.
>> THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL DELIBERATIVE MATERIALS.
CANDID, INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE, THE INTEGRITY, AND
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND WOULD BE CHILLED
BY DISCLOSURE TO CONGRESS.
>> Jon: WE'RE COMPLETELY (BLEEP)ED.
(LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT
