>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
YOU KNOW --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE HYPER
BOLLIC RHETORIC IN THE PUBLIC
SWEAR AND HOW IT MAY NOT SERVE
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF GETTING
(bleep) DONE.
BUT HOW WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE THIS
TYPE OF RHETORIC?
IS IT AS JUSTICE OLIVER WENDELL
HOLMES SAID OF OBSCENEITY, THAT
WHICH GIVES YOU WOOD?
[LAUGHTER]
PARAPHRASI
PARAPHRASI
PARAPHRASI
[LAUGHTER]
HERE IS SOMETHING THAT MAY
QUALIFY.
IT'S THE LATEST CAMPAIGN AD FROM
FLORIDA DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
AND BATMAN WARD ALAN GRAYSON.
>> DANIEL WARD WANTS TO FORCE
THAT ON US.
>> SHE SHOULD SUBMIT TO ME.
>> TAL DAN WEBSTER.
HANDS OFF OUR BODIES AND OUR
LAWS.
>> Jon: TALIBAN DAN --?
YOUR OPPONENT IN THE EIGHTH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF
FLORIDA SAY FUNDAMENTAL
RELIGIOUS ZEALOT THAT BEHEADS
AND BEFOOTS AND BEHANDS AND
BEGENITALS AND PERHAPS BEDAZZLES
ALL OF THOSE WHO WOULD DISAGREE
WITH HIS MEDIEVAL WORLD VIEW AND
SECOND ALL, TALIBAN DAN, AREN'T
YOU GOING TO BE SUED BY THE
RESTAURANT CHAIN?
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY, THEIR GO-TACHOS ARE
EXCELLENT TO.
BE FAIR TO CONGRESSMAN GRAYSON
THIS SUBMIT TO ME QUOTING THE
FWIEBL JUSTIFY OPPRESSING WOMEN
IS PRETTY -- THE BIBLE TO
JUSTIFY OPPRESSING WOMEN IS
AWFUL.
>> I HAVE VERSES TOUR MY WIFE.
DON'T -- VERSES FOR MY WIFE.
DON'T PICK THE ONES THAT SAY SHE
SHOULD SUBMIT TO ME.
THAT'S IN THE BIBLE.
PICK THE ONES YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO DO.
SO INSTEAD THAT YOU LOVE YOUR
WIFE.
>> Jon: OH, I'M MISSION THE
ENTIRE -- MISSING THE ENTIRE
CONTEXT.
IN FACT, HE SAID THE OPPOSITE.
THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A
CANDIDATE WHOSE LEGISLATIVE
PRIORITIES YOU MAY AGREE WITH
BUT WOULD PREFER THAT HE WIN THE
DAY THROUGH THE SUPERIORITY OF
HIS IDEAS AAS OPPOSED TO THE
SUPERIORITY OF HIS EDITING.
THERE'S A KIND OF THING THAT
RAISES THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
ISSUES OF DAY AND THE MOST
POWERFUL POLITICAL FIGURES OF
THIS COUNTY.
QUESTIONS LIKE?
>> WAS SARAH PALIN BOOED OR NOT
INTRODUCED ON DANCING WITH
STARS.
>> Jon: WHAT SNOW WHO CARES?
>> PEOPLE WONDERED WONDERED IF SARAH
PALIN WAS GETTING BOOED.
>> SARAH PALIN WAS PWAOD.
>> WAS SHE BOOED BY THE
AUDIENCE?
>> WAS SARAH PALIN BOOED?
>> Jon: WHO, WHO, WHO GIVES A
(bleep)?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHO GIVES A (bleep)?
WHAT DIFFERENCE DID IT MAKE?
DO YOU THINK SHE'S A POLARIZING
FIGURE?
YES, THIS FINALLY PUTS TO REST
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT
SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE OF
DANCING WITH THE STARS
DISAPPROVES WITH SARAH PALIN.
COMING UP NEXT ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE EXSTRAP LATE ABLE OR
MEANINGLESSFUL.
THE MEDIA IS TREATING THIS LIKE
IT'S A NATIONAL SCANDAL.
WE'RE CALLING IT BOO GATE.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: DON'T MAKE ME
SYMPATHIZE WITH HER.
[LAUGHTER]
DON'T.
I SAY IT'S TIME WE FIGHT BACK
AGAINST THE OUTRAGEOUS
DISTORTIONS AND MEANINGLESS
DISTRACTIONS.
RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY ON THE
NATIONAL MALL ON OCTOBER OWE --
30.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
COME TO THE RALLY TO RESTORE
SANITY.
THERE WAS A STARTLING
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT HOW SOME
PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CAN GET
THERE.
>> COME TO THE HAD YOU EVERRING
PARK 560 BROADWAY IN SOHO THE
BUS WILL BE THERE.
WE'LL TAKE YOU WITH US.
WE HAVE AS MANY BUSES AS THERE
ARE PEOPLE TO FILL THEM.
THAT'S OUR PROMISE.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD ARREST
RIHANNA HUFFINGTON OPRAHED THE
BUSES.
DARLING, YOU GET A BUS.
EVERYBODY GETS A BUS.
EVERYBODY GETS A BUS!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BY THE WAY -- I HOPE THAT HER
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS REAL AND NOT
HUFFINGTON POST IT'S NOT ACTUAL
TRANSPORTATION IT'S NOT JUST
EMBEDDING A LINK TO GREYHOUND.
I HOPE THEY ARE NOT -- FUR
ATTENDING STEPHEN COLBERT'S
MARCH TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE I HEARD
THE DRUDGE REPORT IS PROVIDING
TRANSPORTATION WITH THE MOTOR
COACH OF TERROR.
