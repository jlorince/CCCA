THAT IS NOT WHAT I DO.
LAST NIGHT WAS THE STATE OFTHE UNION ADDRESS.
IN MY TIME HERE, IN MY TIMEHERE AT THE LET'S CALL IT
ANCHOR DESK, I HAVE COVEREDPROBABLY 62 OF THESE.
IT'S BECOME AS MUCH ASJANUARY RITUAL FOR ME AS MY
MIDDAY FOUR-HOUR SEASONALEFFECTIVE DISORDER NAP.
SO TO BE HONEST, I'M ALITTLE OVER IT WITH THE
PROMISING AND THE CLAPPINGAND THE -- WAIT, WHO, IS THAT

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SO GOING INTO LAST NIGHT,
I GOT TO TELL YOU, LESS THANEXCITED.
UNTIL I HEARD WHAT WAS GOINGTO HAPPEN.
>> THIS IS THE BIGGEST NIGHTOF THE YEAR IN AMERICAN
POLITICS.
>> TONIGHT'S THE BIG NIGHTIN WASHINGTON.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL TAKEON TAX REFORM IN THIS YEAR'S
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESSIN A BIG WAY.
>> AN EXCITING NIGHT IN THENATION'S CAPITOL.
>> Jon: OH MY GOSH, TAXREFORM, OH MY GOD,
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD!
(LAUGHTER)YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN.
EVEN IF THEY STAGEDRELATIVELY ROTE EXERCISE AND
POLITICAL THEATER PASSINGFOR AN EXCITING NIGHT IN
YOUR TOWN MAKES ME SAD, ITMAKES ME WANT TO TAKE
WASHINGTON D.C. TO THAILANDWITH LEONARDO DiCAPRIO AND
AN EIGHT BALL AND SHOW YOUWHAT LIFE COULD REALLY BE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBETHIS WILL BE EXCITING.
IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'SSECOND TO LAST STATE OF THE
UNION, FIRST TIME PRESIDINGOVER A FULLY REPUBLICAN
CONGRESS.
HE'S TAKING ON TAX REFORM INA BIG WAY.
SO I HEAR.
LET'S DO THIS [BLEEP].
>> LET'S CLOSE THE LOOPHOLESTHAT LEAD TO INEQUALITY BY
ALLOWING THE TOP 1% TO AVOIDPAYING TAXES ON THEIR
ACCUMULATED WEALTH.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: IS -- IS THAT IT? IS
THAT -- CAUSE THE NEWS PEOPLE,THE NEWS PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE
UNVEILING A BIG TAX REFORMPROPOSAL AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS GOING TO BE LIKE ELIZABETHWARREN IS GOING TO GET A
STUN GUN AN WE'RE LETTINGHER LOOSE ON WALL STREET!
EVEN THOUGH I THINK THAT ISLIKE A BOLT GUN.
OR MAYBE THERE'S GOING TO BEA NEW SO-CALLED ROMNEY TAX
WHICH IS A TAX ON ROMNEYS!
BUT AS FREE AS HE FELT, THEPRESIDENT NEVER FORGOT WHERE
HE CAME FROM.
>> YOU KNOW, JUST OVER ADECADE AGO I GAVE A SPEECH
IN BOSTON WHERE I SAID THEREWASN'T A LIBERAL AMERICA, OR
A CONSERVATIVE AMERICA, ABLACK AMERICA, OR WHITE
AMERICA, BUT A UNITED STATESOF AMERICA.
I STILL BELIEVE THAT WE AREONE PEOPLE.
>> Jon: MR. PRESIDENT, JONSTEWART, NEW ORLEANS TIMES
PICAYUNE.
I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU,BEING PRESIDENT FOR SIX
YEARS IN WASHINGTON D.C. FORTEN YEARS, WHY WOULD YOU
STILL THINK THAT?
(LAUGHTER)IT'S AMAZING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU'VE BEENIN WASHINGTON D.C.
HOW DO YOU STILL HAVE THATHOPE?
YOU LIVE IN THE CITY AMERICAINVENTED FOR THE SOLE
PURPOSE OF SENDING ITS MOSTPETTY, MOST PARTISAN,
ARGUMENTATIVE ASSHOLES, APLACE EVIDENTLY SO TERRIBLE,
THE HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVESES WHO SOLE
PURPOSE IS TO HAVEREPRESENTATION, WILL NOT
ALLOW IT TO BE REPRESENTED.
LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE YOUDEAL WITH EVERY DAY.
LOOK AT THEM NOT REACT TOWHAT UNDER NORMAL HUMAN
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BEUNANIMOUS APPLAUSE LINES.
>> THIS CONGRESS STILL NEEDSTO PASS A LAW THAT MAKES
SURE A WOMAN IS PAID THESAME AS A MAN FOR DOING THE
SAME WORK.
11 MILLION NEW JOBS.
A STOCK MARKET THAT HASDOUBLED AND HEALTH CARE
INFLATION AT ITS LOWEST RATEIN 50 YEARS.
(APPLAUSE)VOTE TO GIVE MILLIONS OF THE
HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE INAMERICA A RAISE.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
ARE YOU SITTING BECAUSE YOUPREFER A LOWER STOCK MARKET
AND FEWER JOBS?
DO YOU SIT BECAUSE YOU WANTHIGHER INFLATION?
NO.
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THEGLUE THAT HOLDS
US TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE ISNOT NEARLY AS STRONG AS THE
GLUE HOLDING THE WOOD OFJOHN BOEHNER'S CHAIR TO THE
WOOD OF JOHN BOEHNER'S ASS!
I SAY THAT HE HAS WOODTHERE AND HIS CHAIR
(APPLAUSE)AND LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN,
AND I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE,AND I SAY THIS TO YOU
TONIGHT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,JOHN BOEHNER, IS GROOT.
I BELIEVE HE IS GROOT. HE LOOKSLIKE GROOT.
WATCH, WATCH, AS THEPRESIDENT HAS TO GO REMEDIAL
ON THESE FOLKS.
>> THIS IS GOOD NEWS, PEOPLE.
>> Jon: THIS IS GOOD NEWS.
YOU [BLEEP] IDIOTS!
AFTER THE SPEECH WE'RE GOINGTO EAT FOOD.
IT GOES IN YOUR MOUTH HOLE.
NOT IF YOU MADE IT.
BLEH.
AND INCIDENTALLY,DEMOCRATS DIDN'T MENTION
THIS GOOD NEWS DURING THEMIDTERMS, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY WANTED TO KEEP CONTROLOF THE SENATE BUT NOT AT THE
COST OF GIVING AWAY ANYSTATE OF THE UNION SPOILERS.
LAST NIGHT IT WAS LIKETHE ENTIRE GOP REALIZED IT
WAS ALLERGIC TO APPLAUDINGTHINGS.
ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, TO ONEREPUBLICAN, SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER  MITCH McCONNELL WASUNABLE TO STAND AND APPLAUD
BECAUSE HE HAD ACCIDENTALLYROLLED ON TO
HIS BACK AND COULD NOT BETURNED OVER UNAIDED.
HE WAS-- (APPLAUSE)
LOOK, EVEN THOUGH -- I GOTTIRED OF WATCHING THIS -- EVEN
THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SPEAKSWITH AFFECTION FOR HOW OUR
COUNTRY REALLY IS UNIFIED,JUST WATCH HOW CLOSE TO THE
EDGE THIS MAN'S TRUEEMOTIONS ABOUT THE PEOPLE HE
WORKS WITH REALLY ARE.
>> I HAVE NO MORE CAMPAIGNSTO RUN.
MY ONLY AGENDA-- (APPLAUSE)
I KNOW CAUSE I WON BOTH OFTHEM.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: THAT IS, FOR MY
MONEY, THAT IS AS CLOSE ASYOU WILL EVER HEAR TO I
DON'T GO DOWN TO WHERE YOUWORK AND KNOCK THE [BLEEP]
OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS, FROM ASITTING UNITED STATES
PRESIDENT, WITH THEEXCEPTION OF COURSE OF
PRESIDENT DANGERFIELD.
IT HAPPENED.
LOOK IT UP.
HE RAN ON A PLATFORM OF LACKOF PERSPECTIVE.
BUT DESPITE ALL THE TALK OFTAX POLICY, TRADE AGREEMENTS
AND VERBAL DICK SLAPS,
AMERICANS REALLY JUST WANT APERSONAL STORY THAT FEELS
SIMILAR TO THEIR OWN.
SO THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT THESPEECH HOME WITH SOME REAL
PEOPLE.
>> SEVEN YEARS AGO REBEKAHAND BEN ERLER OF MINNEAPOLIS
WERE NEWLY-WEDS.
SHE WAITED TABLES.
HE WORKED CONSTRUCTION.
BEN'S BUSINESS DRIED UP.
REBEKAH TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANSAN ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY
COLLEGE AND RETRAINED FOR ANEW CAREER.
REBEKAH GOT A BETTER JOB ANDTHEN A RAISE, THEY BOUGHT THEIR
FIRST HOME. AMERICA, REBEKAH ANDBEN'S STORY IS OUR STORY.
>> Jon: WHAT?
THEIR STORY IS AMERICA'SSTORY?
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WAY TOOMUCH PRESSURE TO PUT ON A
COUPLE.
NOW THEY HAVE TO STAYTOGETHER.
HONEY, I FEEL LIKE IT'S NOTWORKING OUT.
GO AHEAD.
WALK OUT ON AMERICA.
