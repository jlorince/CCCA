TURNED THAT ON ITS HEAD.
(LAUGHTER) NOW YOU MAY WONDER, HOW DID WE GET HERE.
IT ALL STARTED TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN PEOPLE GOT WIND OF THE CHICK-FIL-A C.E.O.s FEELINGS
ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE.
>> I THINK WE'RE INVITING GOD'S JUDGEMENT ON OUR NATION WHEN WE SHAKE OUR
FIST AT HIM AND SAY WE KNOW BETTER THAN YOU AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A MARRIAGE AND I
PRAY GOD'S MERCY ON OUR GENERATION THAT HAS SUCH A PRIDEFUL, ARROGANT ATTITUDE
TO THINK THAT WE HAD THE AWE DOSIT OT TRY TO REDE-- ODD ASITY TO TRY TO REDEFINE
WHAT MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT.
>> Jon: OF COURSE IT IS PERFECTLY OKAY TO HAVE THE ODD ASITY TO REENGINEER
GOD'S CHICKEN DESIGN TO MAKE THEM 95% BREAST MEAT AND DROP A COUPLE OF STRIPS OF
BACON AND CHEESE ON TOP OF THEM BAD BOYS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TAKE EVERYTHING-- BUT
STILL THIS MAN SAY PRIVATE CITIZEN.
HE'S A PRIVATE CITIZEN.
HE IS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, A PRIVATE BUSINESS.
HE'S GOT EVERY RIGHT TO HIS OPINION.
JUST LIKE OTHER PRIVATE CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIRS.
>> TO TOP THE WORD BIBLICAL AS A PR DECISION AND FEEL GOOD WAY OF SAYING YOU ARE
HOME PHOBIC WITHOUT RISKING YOUR BUSINESS NOT ONLY CHEAPENS YOUR BIBLE BUT DISRESPECTS YOUR GOD.
>> THOSE KIND ARE OF MESSAGES AND RHETORIC IS HURTFUL.
>> IF YOU LIKE MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND ARE FOR IT, YOU ARE A CHICKEN-- AND YOU GO
THERE THAT DAY ARE YOU A CHICKEN EATING JUDAS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IS THERE REALLY ANY OTHER KIND OF JUDAS?
LET ME PRESENT TO YOU MY ONE MAN PLAY.
I GIVE YOU THE LAST SUPPER.
(LAUGHTER) ONE OF YOU-- HOLD ON.
(APPLAUSE) ONE OF YOU WILL BETRAY ME.
>> WHO, ME?
PLAY DIDN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE.
SO BASICALLY SO FAR WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A PRETTY TYPICAL CULTURE WAR SKIRMISH.
DOESN'T SEEM ENOUGH TO WARRANT A MILLION MOUTH MARCH.
UNTIL.
>> BOSTON MAYOR THOMAS MENINO IS PROMISING TO BLOCK CHICK-FIL-A TO OPEN A STORE IN BOSTON.
>> THE MAYOR RAHM EMMANUEL THREATENS HE IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW CHICK-FIL-A IN CHICAGO.
>> AND NOW SAN FRAN IS TELLING CHICK FILL AYE IT IS NOT WELCOME.
>> OH BOY.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW HOW THE RIGHT IS ALWAYS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT
PERSECUTING THEM FOR THEIR BELIEF?
MISTAKING NOT BEING ABLE TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WHENEVER THEY WANT FOR CENSORSHIP?
WELL, IN THIS CASE, I'M PRETTY SURE THEY GOT SOMETHING.
PRETTY SURE YOU CAN'T OUTLAW A COMPANY WITH PERFECTLY LEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
BECAUSE YOU KIND THEIR C.E.O.s VIEWS REPELLENT.
NOT SURE WHICH AMENDMENT COVERS THAT BUT IT'S PROBABLY IN THE TOP ONE.
(LAUGHTER) I THINK MAYBE THE MAYORS HADN'T THOUGHT THIS THING THROUGH.
>> I DON'T WANT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE AGAINST PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.
AND THAT'S WHO I AM AND THAT IS WHAT BOSTON IS ALL ABOUT.
>> CHICK-FIL-A'S VALUES ARE NOT CHICAGO VALUES.
>> REALLY S BEING AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE YOUR STANDARD OF VALUES?
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THERE IS ALREADY ANOTHER FRANCHISE-BASED ANTI-GAY
MARRIAGE ORGANIZATION WHICH BRANCHES THROUGHOUT YOUR CITY.
YOU MORE THAN LIKELY EMBRACE.
THERE IT IS.
(LAUGHTER) THAT'S THE ONE, OVER1 BILLION SERVED.
ALBEIT VERY SMALL PORTIONS.
NOT THAT THE CHICK-FIL-A-TERS THEMSELVES-- IS THAT-- IS THE T SILENT?
DID NOT HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES WITH OVERREACH.
>> THIS IS A BIG DAY, NOT FOR CHICK-FIL-A BUT FOR AMERICA, AND FOR PEOPLE WHO
BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY, INCLUDING CHRISTIANS.
>> Jon: YOU GO, CHRISTIANS.
DON'T YOU STOP UNTIL THERE'S A CHURCH IN EVERY TOWN IN AMERICA.
OH, REALLY?
WELL, HOW ABOUT EVERY BLOCK.
REALLY?
(LAUGHTER) OH WELL.
(LAUGHTER) LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ACTUALLY DROVE PEOPLE TO THE CHICK-FIL-A'S YESTERDAY.
SUPPORTING THE FIRST AMENDMENT, GREAT.
A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW YOU'RE TIRED OF GETTING PUSHED AROUND BY THE GAY AGENDA,
LAME.
YOU REALLY LIKE CHICKEN SANDWICHES AND HAD NO IDEA YESTERDAY WAS LITMUS TEST LUNCH DAY.
(LAUGHTER) ALL I KNOW IS THIS, IF THE MASSIVE CULTURE WAR ARMAGEDDON WE HAVE BEEN
DREADING FOR YEARS TAKES THE FORM OF RECORD ONE DAY CHICKEN SANDWICH SALES,
MAYBE EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY FROM THIS A WINNER.
THE RIGHT FINALLY HAS GOT THEMSELVES A LEGITIMATE FIRST AMENDMENT GRIPE.
AND AS A BONUS, A FRIED MEAT SANDWICH BASS PRODUCT TEST THAT CAN ALSO BE SEEN AS A
LITTLE BIT OF A [BLEEP] TO A CERTAIN SOMEONE'S HEALTHY EATING INITIATIVE.
AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY OR SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE, I GET HOW SEEING THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE COME OUT TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT IS INCREDIBLY DISHEARTENING.
BUT TAKE SOLAS IN THIS, GAY MARRIAGE IS HAPPENING.
LIKE MANY DRIVE-THREW WINDOW LANES CONTINUATION AIN'T GOING BACKWARDS.
AND YOUR BON SUS THIS.
YOU GET GAY MARRIAGE.
ALL YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS ARE GOING TO GET IS TYPE II DIABETES.
(LAUGHTER) SO HERE'S MY PREDICTION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN TEN YEARS-- HERE IS MY PREDICTION.
I AM THE AMAZING CARNAC.
IN TEN YEARS AMERICA WILL HAVE A LOT MORE GAY MARRIAGE AND A LOT MORE CHICK-FIL-A
RESTAURANTS BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH QUALITY PRODUCTS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
