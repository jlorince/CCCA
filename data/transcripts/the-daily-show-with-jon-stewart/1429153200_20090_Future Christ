WELCOME BACK.
NOW, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, WE WERETALKING EARLIER,
CHRISTIANITY HAS A LONG HISTORY,
ALMOST AS LONG AS THE JEWS--NOT THAT, OBVIOUSLY, NOT THAT
IT'S A COMPETITION OR ANYTHING.
WE'VE JUST OBVIOUSLY BEEN AROUNDFOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS LONG.
THE POINT IS THIS, WHAT IS THEFUTURE OF CHRISTIANITY?
JORDAN KLEPPER INVESTIGATES.
>> CHRISTIAN CHURCH ATTENDANCEIN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES
TO DWINDLE, BUT ACCORDING TO THENEW YORK TIMES, THERE WAS ONE
PASTOR CARL LENTZ WHO WASDRAWING RECORD CROWDS
WITH AN INNOVATIVE STYLE.
BUT WAS HE THE REAL DEAL?
EXCUSE ME, YOUNG ROCK BANDMEMBER, I'M LOOKING FOR A STUFFY
OLD PASTOR WHO SAYS HE HASA MODERN TWIST ON CHRISTIANITY.
>> I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FORME.
>> THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT.
>> YEAH, YEAH. WE'RE GOING TO--LET'S JUST HUG IT OUT.
>> YEAH, THAT. YEAH.
THAT FEELS RIGHT.
>> GREAT TO MEET YOU.
>> YEAH, GOOD TO HANG OUT WITHYOU, MEET YOU.
>> YEAH. YEAH.
>> COOL.
WAS I FACE TO FACE WITH THEFUTURE OF CHRISTIANITY?
FUTURE CHRIST.
COPYRIGHT JORDAN KLEPPER.
PASTOR LENTZ HAD IT ALL.
SKINNY JEANS, THE DOUCHE BEANIEAND HE PLAYED GRAND THEFT AUTO
IN GORE MODE.
IN SOLD-OUT STADIUMS ACROSSTHE COUNTRY THIS GUY HAD BOTH
BELIEVERS AND BELIEBERS.
IF YOU HAD TO DESCRIBE YOURCHURCH EXPERIENCE IN FOUR WORDS,
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT?
>> SUPER, SUPER, SUPER, DOPE.
>> YEAH.
SO IS THIS THE FUTURE OFCHRISTIANITY?
>> I THINK, YEAH.
OUR CHURCH, WE'RE GOING TO GETDOWN TO IT.
YOU CAN GET BIBLE VERSES ON YOURPHONE.
YOU CAN WATCH A LIVE LINK.
SO IF YOU CAN'T COME TO CHURCH,YOU CAN, LIKE, GET ON YOUR SMART
PHONE.
>> OH, SWEET.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME DOPEBEATS.
>> YEAH.
>> RESPECT.
>> ONE LOVE.
>> COOL.
>> HOLLER.
ROCK ON.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP SAYINGTHOSE THINGS.
CARL'S TURNING CHRIST UP TOELEVEN.
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOMERELIGIOUS LEADERS, LIKE REVEREND
DR. CHRISTOPHER BENEK, AREN'TDIGGING ON CARL'S DOPE SAUCE.
>> I HAVE SEEN SOME HIPSTERPASTORS AND I THINK THEY'RE
MISSING THE BOAT IF THEY'RETRYING TO SENSATIONALIZE
THE CHURCH.
>> SO WHAT DOES THIS GUY THINKWILL REVOLUTIONIZE CHRISTIANITY?
>> ROBOTS.
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THE FUTUREOF CHRISTIANITY INCLUDES ROBOTS?
>> POTENTIALLY.
>> HOW DOES A ROBOT BECOMECHRISTIAN?
>> WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUTA ROOMBA, OR YOUR iPHONE
OR TALKING TO SIRI.
WE'RE TALKING SOMETHING THAT'SYOU KNOW EXPONENTIALLY MORE
INTELLIGENT THAN WE ARE.
SO ROBOTS WILL CHOOSE TO BECHRISTIANS.
>> YOU'RE SAYING ROBOTS.
GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVEHIGHER THOUGHT, THEY WILL
CHOOSE CHRISTIANITY?
>> YEAH.
I THINK-- I THINK IT'S REASONEDARGUMENT.
>> THIS SOUNDED AWESOME.
CARL MUST BE PUMPED.
DOMO ARIGATO MR. CHRIST!
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I COULDREALLY CARE ABOUT A ROBOT AT
ALL.
>> YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THEFUTURE, THOUGH.
>> SO BE IT.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL GOINGOLD-SCHOOL PRAYER.
>> BUT IS OLD-SCHOOL PRAYER THEFUTURE OR WILL ROBOTS REMIX
THOSE JAMS?
>> IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TOPROCESS ALL OF THE INFORMATION
ON EARTH INSTANTANEOUSLY, YOUCOULD WRITE A PRETTY GOOD
SERMON.
>> SWEET.
>> YEAH.
>> A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AGUY WITH A TATTOOS AND A KICK
DRUM.
>> YEAH, SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ASFAR AS INTELLIGENCE GOES.
>> HIPSTER PASTOR SLAM.
>> AM I MISSING SOMETHING?
LIKE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- LIKE,A ROBOT IS CREATED -- I DON'T
THINK A ROBOT COULD HAVE FAITH.
>> SURE, ROBOTS COULD HAVEFAITH.
ABSOLUTELY, WHY NOT?
THE HOPE WOULD BE YOUKNOW BEINGS THAT WOULD
ESSENTIALLY LEAD TO US A NEWPATH OF HOLINESS.
>> NEW PATH OF HOLINESS SOUNDSFUTURE CRUNK, RIGHT.
I MEAN, CLEARLY JESUS IS INNEED OF A REBOOT.
IS THERE A NEW SON OF GOD WESHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR?
IS THERE A CODY.
>> I FEEL LIKE HE TRANSCENDSTIME.
>> HEAR ME OUT -->> OKAY.
>> FATHER, SON,HOLY GHOST, AND CODY.
>> WHO'S CODY IN THAT?
>> EXACTLY, MAN, THAT GUY IS AMYSTERY.
>> I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE JESUSISN'T IN NEEED OF A REBOOT
AT ALL.
I THINK HIP STUFF GOES OUT OFSTYLE.
THAT'S THE THING.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'RE STILL WEARING FONZI'SJACKET.
OKAY ROBO DORK, SHOW ME THEFUTURE.
>> I THINK AS A SPECIES, THEYCAN USE THEIR GIFTS TO FURTHER
JESUS' REDEMPTIVE PURPOSES.
>> ARE YOU CALLING A ROBOT ADIFFERENT SPECIES?
>> YEAH POTENTIALLY, UNLESSWE'RE INTEGRATED WITH THEM.
>> ( BLEEP ) ROBOTS?
>> NO, NO, NO. LIKE A CYBORG.
>> LIKE IF HUMANS ARE GOING TOMAKE SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE
THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUTA WAY TO GIVE IT A GENDER
AND ( BLEEP ) IT.
CHRISTIAN ROBOTS ARE GOING TOBLOW YOUR MIND.

AND ONCE HE DOWNLOADED THEBIBLE, HE DID HAVE A FEW
QUESTIONS.
>> WHERE CAN I BUY MYHEBREW SLAVE?
>> YOU CAN'T.
>> SERIOUSLY.
>> SORRY, IT'S NOT AN OPTION.
>> THE BIBLE SAYS I CAN HAVE ONEIN EXODUS 21.
IT'S HALF THE REASON I SIGNEDUP.
>> THIS WAS NOT GOING WELL.
>> CAN GOD CREATE SOMETHING SOHEAVY HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
LIFT IT?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TOTHAT. I'M SORRY.
>> IF GOD WANTS TO QUIT SMOKING,CAN HE HIDE CIGARETTES FROM
HIMSELF?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TOTHAT. I'M SORRY.
>> WHY DOES GOD GIVE BABIESCANCER?
>> IT'S NOT JESUS-- JESUSADVOCATE--
