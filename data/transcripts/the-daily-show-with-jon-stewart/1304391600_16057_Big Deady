>> Jon: WELCOME, WELCOME.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
I APPLAUD YOU.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD SHOW FOR
YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT PHILIP
K.HOWARD IS FILLING IN FOR
OUR... WE HAD AN ORIGINALLY
SCHEDULED GUEST OSAMA BIN
LADEN WHO IS...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT IT WAS
A PRETTY SPECIAL BOOKING.
I KNEW HE WOULD PUSS OUT.
LET ME TELL YOU HOW I HEARD
THE NEWS OF OSAMA BIN LADEN'S
DEMISE.
I'M WATCHING CELEBRITY
APPRENTICE.
NOW I'M WATCHING IT.
I'M WATCHING IT TO SEE IF
OBAMA AND SETH MYERS' ABSOLUTE
SHELLACKING OF DONALD TRUMP AT
THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER ON
SATURDAY HAD LEFT A VISIBLE
MARK.
I'M WATCHING THIS APPRENTICE
EPISODE, EVEN THOUGH THE
EPISODE HAD BEEN TAPED PRIOR
TO THE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER,
THE DEMOLITION OF TRUMP AT THE
CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER WAS SO
THOROUGH I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
ACTUALLY SUPERSEDE THE RULES
OF DIMENSIONAL TIME AND SPACE
AND LEAVE A MARK ON FUTURE
EPISODES OF THE APPRENTICE.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
SO ON THE APPRENTICE JUST WHEN
IT LOOKED LIKE THE SAD, DARK-
HAIRED LADY WAS ABOUT TO BE
RITUALLY SACRIFICED BY THE
LADY WHO USED TO RUIN THE VIEW
>> THIS IS AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL
REPORT.
>> GOOD EVENING FROM
WASHINGTON.
WE WILL HEAR FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
HE WILL ADDRESS THE COUNTRY.
>> Jon: BOOM!
THEY BREAK INTO CELEBRITY
APPRENTICE?
THIS IS LIKE 10:30 AT NIGHT.
OUT OF NOWHERE.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS AN
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> Jon: SO IMMEDIATELY YOU
START THINKING THERE'S ONLY
TWO THINGS THIS COULD PROBABLY
BE.
A, THE PRESIDENT IS
INTERRUPTING CELEBRITY
APPRENTICE TO DELIVER MORE
JOKES, THE ONES THAT HE HAD
NOT QUITE FINISHED, ABOUT
DONALD TRUMP.
HE JUST POPPED UP ON SUNDAY
AND WENT LIKE, "OH, (BEEP),
THAT WAS A GREAT ONE."
HE WAS GOING TO INTERRUPT THE
SHOW TO GET HIM SOME MORE.
OR, B, THE MORE LIKELY
SCENARIO, AS HOLLYWOOD HAS
TAUGHT US, WHEN A BLACK
PRESIDENT INTERRUPTS YOUR SHOW
A METEOR IS HEADED TOWARDS THE
EARTH.
SO I START FLIPPING AROUND.
I'M FLIPPING AROUND, RIGHT?
I'M FLIPPING AROUND.
IT'S CLEAR ALL THE NEWS PEOPLE
KNOW WHAT THIS IS BUT THEY
CAN'T SAY IT YET.
AND THIS GOES ON FOR LIKE A
HALF AN HOUR.
>> IT'S GOING TO BE THE
PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE
NATION FROM THE EAST ROOM AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ON WHAT
THAT MIGHT BE.
>> WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THIS IS
THE RESULT OF AN INCIDENT THAT
THE UNITED STATES INITIATED.
>> WE THINK, WE THINK WHAT?
WHAT DO WE THINK?
>> A C.I.A. OPERATION... CAN I
SAY OVERSEAS?
>> YES, YES, YES.
>> I CAN SAY IT HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH SOMETHING OVERSEAS.
YES.
A BRAVE, SERIOUS C.I.A.
OPERATION OVERSEAS.
>> Jon: CAN I SAY THAT IT
INVOLVES A BEARDED DIALYSIS
PATIENT?
CAN I SAY IT'S MORE EXTREMIST
THAN A BREAD BOX?
NO?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, SEACREST
DOESN'T DRAW OUT AN
ELIMINATION THIS LONG.
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO
BREAK THE NEWS HIMSELF.
BUT AT LEAST COULDN'T THE NEWS
LET US KNOW THAT WE COULD ALL
RELAX.
ALL WE KNEW WAS THE PRESIDENT
WAS GOING TO TELL US SOMETHING
ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR MOM LEAVES
YOU THAT SUPER EARLY MORNING
VOICE MAIL CONSISTING OF,
"IT'S YOUR MOTHER.
CALL ME."
AND THAT'S IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW, IS IT
MALIGNANT OR DID THE
NEIGHBOR'S KID GET INTO BROWN?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS.
BUT JUST GO AND, "BY THE WAY,
DON'T WORRY."
BUT THEN FINALLY AT 11:35 P.M.
EASTERN JUSTICE TIME, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
>> TONIGHT, I CAN REPORT TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO THE
WORLD THAT THE UNITED STATES
HAS CONDUCTED AN OPERATION
THAT KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
GIVE HIM A LITTLE MUSICAL
THEATER THERE.
YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
I COULD DO THAT.
A LOT OF FANS HERE OF MY LESS
THAN IMPRESSIVE MOVIE CAREER.
WHY DON'T WE?
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
AS AN AMERICAN, AS A NEW
YORKER, YOU FELT LIKE THE NEWS
COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER AND
THEN IT DID.
>> TODAY AT MY DIRECTION, THE
UNITED STATES LAUNCHED A
TARGETED OPERATION AGAINST
THAT COMPOUND IN ABBOTTABAD
PAKISTAN.
>> Jon: WHAT?
NOT ONLY DO WE KILL BIN LADEN,
WE KILL HIM IN ABBOTTABAD.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE NAME MOST
NEW YORKERS WOULD HAVE
INVENTED FOR THE FICTIONAL
PLACE THEY WOULD HAVE LOVED TO
KILL BIN LADEN.
ABBOTTABAD.
THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY
MIND.
"HEY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I
WOULD DO.
YOU GIVE ME A GUN, YOU DROP ME
INTO (BEEP) ABBOTTABAD OR
WHATEVER THEY CALL THEIR
(BEEP) CITIES OVER THERE.
I'LL GIVE HIM A SHOT.
I'LL GO OVER THERE.
I'LL GO TO (BEEP) AABBOTTABAD
AND SHOOT HIM IN HIS
ABBOTTABAD."
I HAVE TO TELL YOU A UNITED
STATES RAID TO GET BIN LADEN
