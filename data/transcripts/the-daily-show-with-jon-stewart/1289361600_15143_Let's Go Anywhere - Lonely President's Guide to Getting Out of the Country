BOBA ESCAPED -- I'M BEING TOLD
HE'S LEAVING.
I'M SORRY.
NO!
LET'S RETURN IF WE CAN TO THE
YEAR 2010.
IT WAS A ROUGH WEEK FOR OUR
PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA.
A MID-TERM ELECTION SHELLACKING,
A POST-MID-TERM ELECTION POST
OFFICE, LET'S SAY SHELLACKING,
NOT TO MENTION RECEIVING FREE
WEDGE I HAVES FROM WHITE HOUSE
BULLY JEFF DUGGAN.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
NOBODY?
"GOOD WILL HUNTING."
NOBODY?
AS EVERYBODY KNOWS, WHEN THE
GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GET
GOING, OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR
ABOUT TEN DAYS.
WE PRESENT TO YOU THE LATEST IN
"THE DAILY SHOW" PRESIDENTIAL
TRAVELOGUE.
ROLL THE CLIP.
♪♪
♪♪
THAT WAS NICE MUSIC.
OBAMA... THEY LOVE ANYTHING WITH
GRAPHICS.
( LAUGHTER )
OBAMA'S FIRST STOP, INDIA, THE
WORLD'S BIGGEST DEMOCRACY,
DEEPLY COMPLEX NATION WITH A
RICH HISTORY AND AN INCREDIBLY
DYNAMIC FUTURE.
WHEN WE THINK OF INDIA, THE MIND
IS FLOODED WITH IMAGES FROM
GANDHIED TO GANGES, FROM THE
SPECTACLE OF BOLLYWOOD TO THE
BUSTLING FINANCIAL CENTERS OF
MUMBAI.
BY THE WAY, DID YOU KNOW CNN'S
ALI BELCHI IS OF INDIAN DECENT.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF
NEPAL, THE AIRLINE, FIXING YOUR
COMPUTER, AND THEY HAVE HARD
TIME UNDERSTANDING.
>> Jon: HE'S SITTING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF YOU.
>> IT'S EVEN THE CENTER OF A NEW
SITCOM ON NBC CALLED
"OUTSOURCED" WHICH HAS BEEN VERY
CONTROVERSIAL.
BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.
I'M CURIOUS IF IT'S OFFENSIVE TO
YOU, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER
DISCUSSION.
>> Jon: I'M CURIOUS IF IT'S
OFFENSIVE TO YOU OR MAYBE IF YOU
FOUND THE [BLEEPED] I SAID
EARLIER OFFENSIVE.
I DON'T KNOW.
ANYWAY, MY POINT IS TO THE
VIEWERS AT HOME, IF YOU HAVE ANY
PROBLEMS WITH YOUR COMPUTERS,
JUST CALL ALI.
I'M SURE HE CAN HANDLE IT.
THE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN NEW
DELHI ON SUNDAY, WHERE HE
RECEIVED A FULL STATE WELCOME,
INCLUDING AN EQUESTRIAN ESCORT,
A 21-GUN SALUTE AND TWO HUMAN
TISSUE DISPENSERS.
IN CASE HE WAS OVERCOME WITH
EMOTION.
I UH... I JUST WISH THOSE GUYS
WERE WITH ME WHEN I WATCHED
"STEEL MAGNOLIAS" LAST NIGHT.
THOSE POOR WOMEN, SO FRAGILE YET
SO STRONG.
THANK YOU, TISSUE MAN.
OH, HE'S AN ILLUSION.
DON'T WORRY, JULIA.
I KNOW YOU DIE, BUT YOU COME
BACK NEXT TIME AS RICHARD GERE'S
BRIDE.
IT'S ALL GOING TO BE OKAY.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
AH, INDIA.
NOW, TYPICALLY, AS YOU KNOW,
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA TRAVELS
OVERSEAS, IT IS TO APOLOGIZE FOR
A GRIEVOUS ERROR THAT HE
BELIEVES AMERICA IN ITS INFINITE
WRONGNESS HAS COMMITTED, OR TO
BOW OBSEQUIOUSLY TO LESSER HEADS
OF STATE.
WHAT INDIGNITY WILL THIS TRIP
HEAP UPON THE OVERBURDENED
SHOULDERS OF OUR OWN UNCLE SAM?
>> I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY
ASK ME, WELL, WHY ARE YOU
SPENDING TIME WITH INDIA, AREN'T
THEY TAKING OUR JOBS, I WANT TO
BE ABLE TO SAY, ACTUALLY, YOU
KNOW WHAT, THEY JUST CREATED
50,000 JOBS.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, HE'S GONE
TO INDIA TO GET OUR JOBS BACK.
HE'S THE RAMBO OF GETTING OUR
JOBS BACK.
HE'S NOT JUST THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
HE'S THE HEAD HUNTER-IN-CHIEF.
I WONDER IF HE'S GOING TO BE
ASKING FOR RESUMES.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
OBAMA IS GETTING OUR JOBS BACK.
WHICH JOBS IS HE GETTING BACK?
IS HE JUST GETTING BACK OUR
[BLEEPED] CALLER IN JOBS?
BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE,
MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
OF GOING TO SPAIN AND GETTING US
ONE OF THOSE THREE-HOUR SIESTA
JOBS.
I'M PUNCHING OUT, BOYS, IT'S
PAELLA TIME.
CLEARLY IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.
SO HOW HAS HE DONE SO FAR?
>> TODAY I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE
INDIA'S PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT TO
PURCHASE TEN C-7 CARGO PLANES,
WHICH WILL SUPPORT 22,000 JOBS
BACK IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> Jon: WE'RE BACK, BABY!
AND THAT'S JUST TO MAKE THE
PLANES, NOT TO MENTION ALL THE
TECH SUPPORT CALL CENTER JOBS IN
THE UNITED STATES FOR WHEN THE
PLANES [BLEEPED] UP.
OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE TO DO TO
MAKE OUR INDIAN CUSTOMERS
COMFORTABLE.
[SPEAKING WITH BROOKLYN ACCENT]:
"HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'.
IT'S RAJEEV IN MUMBAI.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS THE
TROUBLE WITH YOUR PLANE?"
22,000 JOBS, THAT'S A START.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO NOW IS KEEP
HIS NOSE CLEAN, A REPUBLICAN
RELATIONS WIN.
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS.
ADORABLE DANCING CHILDREN.
MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S A TRAP.
OH, WAIT, THIS IS BARACK OBAMA.
IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE KIDS WERE
BOWLING.
THEY'RE DANCING.
AND IF I RECALL, IN THE CAMPAIGN
OUR PRESIDENT'S GOT SOME MOVES.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WOULD
CALL HIM WILLIAM HOWARD SHAFT.
JAMES K. POLKA.
( LAUGHTER )
ANDREW JACKSON FIVE.
NO, NO, DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS.
( LAUGHTER )
DWIGHT D. EISEN-FOOTLOOSE.
I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING SAD?
THIS IS THE REST OF THE SHOW.
I HAVE 50 OF THESE.
AND THERE'S ONLY 44 PRESIDENTS.
MY POINT IS THIS: HE'S GOT IT,
SO JUMP IN, BABY.
THIS IS MICHELLE SHAKING IT UP
IN STYLE, CAPTURING THE HEARTS
AND MINDS OF THE INDIAN PUBLIC,
DOING IT RIGHT.
AND HERE'S THE PRESIDENT
BEING... WHAT THE [BLEEPED]
HAPPENED TO THE PRESIDENT.
WHAT?
YOU'RE... ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU'RE MOVING LIKE JOHN F. CAN'T
DANCITY.
FRANKLIN DELANO-MOVES-AVELT.
I HAVE 50 OF THESE.
I GUESS IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY,
YOU CAMPAIGN WITH RHYTHM, BUT
YOU GOVERN LIKE AN OLD WHITE MAN
AT A WEDDING.
( LAUGHTER )
HEY, REST OF THE WORLD, MAY I
ASK YOU A QUESTION?
WHY DO OUR GUYS ALWAYS HAVE TO
DANCE FOR YOUR CULTURAL
AMUSEMENT?
REMEMBER THIS?
♪♪
♪♪
THAT IS GOLD.
THAT IS GOLD.
THAT IS... THAT IS GOOD TIMES.
YOU KNOW, AMERICA MAY HAVE ITS
PROBLEMS AND THE WORLD MAY FIND
OUR POLITICS ONEROUS AT TIMES,
BUT ONE THING WE DON'T DO IS
MAKE YOUR LEADERS LITERALLY
DANCE FOR US.
OH, PRESIDENT SARKOZY, THANKS SO
MUCH FOR COMING.
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
MRS. BOYLE'S FIFTH GRADE CLASS
WOULD LIKE THE SEE YOU
GRAPEVINE.
CHANCELLOR MERKEL, PUT YOUR HAND
ON MY HIP, WHEN
