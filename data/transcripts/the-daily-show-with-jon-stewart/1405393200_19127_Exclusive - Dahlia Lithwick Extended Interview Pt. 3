>> Jon: IS THIS ALL BASED ONTHIS RFRA, THIS RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT THAT WASSIGNED IN 1993? IS THE IDEA THAT
BECAUSE THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED,THERE ARE REALLY ARE NOW
RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS?
I GUESS, FOR ME IT'S NOTEVEN THE INDIVIDUAL.
IT'S SUDDENLY APPLYING THATRIGHT TO A CORPORATION IS
STUNING TO ME THAT WHEN YOU GOTO WORK FOR A CORPORATION, YOU
NOW OWN ALL OF THEIR BELIEFSYSTEM THAT THEY WANT YOU TO
OWN.
BUT WITH NONE OF THE RECOURSE.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OF THERESPONSIBILITY, BUT THEY GET ALL
THE PROTECTIONS.
>> RIGHT.
AND THIS CASE IS EXTRAORDINARYIN MANY WAYS, BUT THE SINGLE
MOST EXTRAORDINARY WAY IS THATTHEY READ RFRA, WHICH HAS THE
WORD PERSONS IN IT TO INCLUDENOT JUST CORPORATIONS RIGHT?
THIS ISN'T THE LITTLE SISTERS ORWHEATON COLLEGE.
THIS IS A FOR-PROFIT CORPORATIONTHAT SELLS SCRAPBOOKING
MATERIALS.
THEY'RE PERSONS FOR THISSTATUTE.
AND THAT'S VERY DRAMATIC.
BUT THE THING THAT YOU'RE SAYINGTHAT IS SO RIGHT AND THAT I
THINK FALLS OUT OFTHE CONVERSATION...
>> Jon: OH, LET'S HEAR THIS.>> THIS IS A SENTENCE MY HUSBAND
HAS NEVER HEARD, BY THE WAY.YOU'RE SO RIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING.
>> Jon: I'M EXCITED. I'MEXCITED.
>> BUT WHAT FALLS OUT OF THECASE AND WHAT'S REALLY SCARY IS
THIS IS FRAMED AS A CASETHAT'S ABOUT HOBBY LOBBY'S
RIGHT'S AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT'SRIGHTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THERE ARE THESE THIRDPARTIES. THEY HAVE 15,000
EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT SHARE THEIRRELIGIOUS BELIEFS
AND THE COURT HAS NEVER HELDTHAT YOUR RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE
CAN TRUMP THE RIGHTS OF THIRDPARTIES WHO ALMOST FALL OUT OF
THE CASE AND ARE NOT EVEN TALKEDABOUT.
>> YEAH. IT'S GONNA BE A VERYINTERESTING TO SEE HOW
CORPORATIONS THEN EXPANDWHATEVER THEIR RIGHTS ARE.
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEEHOBBY LOBBY GET A CHANCE TO OPEN
CARRY. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE STORES NOWWITH GIANT RIFLES ON TOP OF
THEM.
SCARING PEOPLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS... IS THEREANYTHING DOWN THE PIKE COMING
THAT YOU LOOK AT AND GO, THATWILL BE THE NEXT CRUCIAL TEST OF
THESE PRINCIPLES?
>> YEAH, BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLEBUNCH OF CASES THAT GOT KICK
BACKED TO THE COURT OF APPEALS,INCLUDING, YOU KNOW,
AN EDEN FOODS CASE. THERE'SA WHOLE BUNCH THAT THE COURT
SAID, WAIT WHILETHIS IS PENDING.
AND SO THOSE ARE ALL GOING TOOCOME BACK IN.
>> DOES THIS PUT THE ONUS ON THEGOVERNMENT NOW IN A
PICK-AND-CHOOSE TERM?
IF I'M A CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORAGAINST THE IRAQ WAR, DO I THEN
SAY, NONE OF MY EMPLOYEES OR
MYSELF HAVE TO PAY TAXES DURINGTHAT PERIOD BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
MY MONEY USED CONSCIENTIOUSLY TOBOMB IRAQ?
>> IT GOES BACK TO... IT GOESBACK TO THE SAME... YOU KNOW,
THERE IS A LONG STRING OFEMPLOYERS WHO HAVE OBJECTED
FROM DEEP, DEEPLY FELT RELIGIOUSFAITHS TO A LOT OF THINGS...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND WE HAVE GENERALLY
SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT NEUTRALGENERALLY APPLICABLE LAWS, THEY
APPLY TO YOU WHETHER YOULIKE IT OR NOT.
THE SOCIETY CANNOT FUNCTION IFEVERYBODY GETS TO OPT OUT OF
THINGS THAT OFFEND THEM.
AND SO I THINK THAT THE WHOLEQUESTION OF HOBBY LOBBY, AND
IT'S A THING THAT WE'RE GOING TOFIND OUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE
YEARS, IS WHETHER THE COURT CANCABINET AS SMALL AS THEY TRY TO.
>> Jon: IS THE REAL TRAGEDYHERE THE RHYMING NATURE OF...
[LAUGHTER]BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF A
COURT CASE, MARBURYVERSUS MADISON, YOU THINK OF
THESE, THE DRED SCOT DECISION,THESE ARE SEMINAL COURSES IN
AMERICAN HISTORY,THESE ARE STATEMENTS OF
PRINCIPLE, BEDROCKS OF THEJUDICIAL SYSTEM, AND YET IT
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULDORDER AT A DENNY'S.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I'LL HAVE THE HOBBYLOBBY.
[LAUGHTER]>> IT'S A PROBLEM.
>> Jon: YOU DO FEEL LIKE WHENYOU SAY IT YOU HAVE TO WEAR A
CHILD'S HAT.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FORCOMING ON AND EXPLAINING A LOT
OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S AWFULLYCONFUSING.
PLEASE READ DAHLIA'S ARTICLE,SLATE.COM.
DAHLIA LITHWICK, THANK YOU SOMUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
