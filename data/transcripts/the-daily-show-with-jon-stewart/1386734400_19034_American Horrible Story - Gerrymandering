[ LAUGHTER ]YOU MIGHT WONDER WHICH POLITICAL
PARTY BEARS MORE RESPONSIBILITYFOR NOTHING GETTING DONE.
OBVIOUSLY EACH SIDE IS BLAMINGTHE OTHER.
BUT HERE'S A TIP. THEPARTY MORE RESPONSIBLE MIGHT BE
THE ONE THAT DEFINED ITS MISSIONTHUSLY.
>> WE SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED ONHOW MANY NEW LAWS WE CREATE.
WE OUGHT TO BE JUDGED ON HOWMANY LAWS WE REPEAL.
>> ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CANDO FOR YOU, ASK WHAT YOU CAN
STOP YOUR COUNTRY FROM DOING!
[LAUGHTER]BUT ALL RIGHT --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]HOW DID THIS LEGISLATIVE CLUSTER
(bleep) HAPPEN?
WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THEWORST CONGRESS OF ALL TIME?
WE SENT JASON JONES TO FINDOUT.
>> THE GRIDLOCK IN CONGRESSEXISTS LARGELY BECAUSE OF ONE
THING.
GERRYMANDERING HAS BECOME AMASSIVE PROBLEM.
>> CONGRESS DOESN'T REALLY LOOKLIKE AMERICA.
>> YES GERRYMANDERING, THEREDRAWING OF
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS TO GIVE APOLITICAL ADVANTAGE TO ONE
PARTY HAS MADE MOST DISTRICTS SOSECURE THAT ONLY 35 TRUE SWING
DISTRICTS REMAIN.
YET THE GERRYMANDERERS WHODRAW THE LINES THINK THEIR WORK
IS DEEPLY MISUNDERSTOOD.
>> PEOPLE MIGHT CRITICIZE WHAT IDO BUT IN ORDER TO BE AN ARTIST
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEMECHANISMS THAT YOU ARE USING,
THE MEDIUM YOU ARE USING.
>> EXACTLY.
WHOA, DID THAT GUY JUST CALLHIMSELF AN ARTIST?
>> IT'S NOT JUST LINES.
THERE'S A STORY BEHIND EACHLINE.
>> THAT'S MIND BLOWING, MAN.
SO YOU ARE JUST A NATURAL BORNARTIST?
>> IT'S -- IT JUST -- WHEN YOUSTUDY DATA.
>> YEAH.
>> YOU END UP SEEING DATA.
>> HIS ARTWORKS ARE ON DISPLAYIN DOZENS OF STATES BUT SADLY
CRITICS LIKE MELANIE SLOANE LONGFOR A DAY WHEN PEOPLE
VOTE IN BORING EQUALLY BASEDPOPULATION SQUARES.
>> THEY ARE NOT ARTISTS.
THEY ARE A CANCER ON GOVERNMENT.
THEIR WHOLE AIM IS TO UNDERMINETHE DEMOCRACY.
>> PEOPLE SAY THE SAME THINGABOUT PICASSO.
>> I REALLY DOUBT THAT THEY DID.
>> LIKE PICASSO HE HAS WEALTHYPOLITCALLY CONNECTED PATRONS.
THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HISWORK.
>> TALK TO ME ABOUT YOURCREATIVE PROCESS.
CR>> WE'RE CREATING THE WHOLEMELIEU
OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FORREDISTRICTING.
>> YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ALOT OF BROWN, A LOT OF HISPANIC
POPULATION.
>> YES, THE HISPANIC POPULATIONHAS ITS OWN FACTORS.
DIFFERENT SHADES, MEXICAN,PUERTO RICAN, CUBAN.
>> HOW WOULD YOU MIX A TOASTEDSESAME CUBAN IN WITH A DARKER
CHOCOLATE DOMINICAN?
>> THAT'S THE ART OFREDISTRICTING, COMING UP WITH
THAT MIX OF LINES.
>> PEOPLE MUST GO CRAZY FOR THISWORK.
>> UM, I DON'T KNOW IF GO CRAZYIF THE RIGHT TERM.
>> WELL, THEY CERTAINLY GO CRAZYAT IT.
AND THEY CERTAINLY DID FORILLINOIS'S FOURTH CONSIDERED THE
MOST GERRYMANDERED DISTRICTIN AMERICA.
>> THIS IS MARRYING THE PUERTORICAN PART OF CHICAGO WITH THE
MEXICAN AND SOUTHERN PART OF THECHICAGO.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE AWHOLE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY
IN THE MIDDLE.
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND AROUNDIT.
>> TO MELANIE THIS IS ANABOMINATION.
WHILE I SEE SOME OF THEDISTRICTS MAY BE INTERESTING TO
LOOK AT THEY ARE OFTEN LINESTHAT DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
>> DOESN'T ALL GOOD ART EFFECTCHANGE?
>> I SUPPOSE GOOD ART CAN EFFECTCHANGE.
>> IS ART PROVOCATIVE?
WHAT AREN'T YOU GETTING MAN?
>> I DON'T AGREE IT'S ART.
>> WHAT IS ART TO YOU?
>> ART IS -- WHAT IS ART?
HMMMM, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
ART IS AH -->> YOU CALL YOURSELF A CRITIC.
WITH SUCH CRITICISM OF GERRYMANDERING GROWING THERE WAS ONLY
ONE WAY TO GET THE RESPECT FORTHE ARTISTS THEY SO RICHLY
DESERVE WITH A NONPARTISANSHOWING.
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?
ART LOVERS MARVELED ATVIRGINIA'S THIRD.
>> I SEE ANGER.
>> PENNSYLVANIA'S SIXTH.
>> LOOKING LIKE ME.
>> AND MARYLAND'S THIRD.
>> IT'S A LARGER FIGURED PERSONTHAT IS TO BE DOMINATING THE
SMALLER FIGURE ON THE RIGHT.
>> WOW THAT'S -- YOU AREOVERTHINKING IT NOW.
>> IT WAS A GRAND DISPLAY OF THEOPTICAL ILLUSION OF FAIRNESS.
YOU TWO MUST LOVE WHAT HE HASDONE WITH BROWN.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THOSE INPOWER CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE
ARTS AND VISIONARIES LIKE HIM.
>> ART IS IN THE EYES OF THEBEHOLDER.
>> WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL STOPWHEN THE COUNTRY IS RUINED?
>> NO, PROBABLY NOT.
>> KEEP DRIVING IT INTO THEGROUND?
>> NO, THE COUNTRY IS VERYRESILIENT.
>> VERY NICE.
