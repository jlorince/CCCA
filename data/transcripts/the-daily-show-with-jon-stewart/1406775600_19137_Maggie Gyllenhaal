THIS THING, THIS, THISMINISERIES?
>> IN 2013.
>> Jon: 2013.>> YEAH.
>> AND YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT TOYOU'RE, WELL, JEEZ WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE THIS AND THENPROBABLY BE OBSOLETE
BECAUSE BY THE TIME IT COMESOUT, THIS WHOLE CONFLICT
WILL BE SOLVED.
>> RIGHT.
RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND PEOPLE WILL SEE ITAS A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT.
>> NO, NOT EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]IT WAS A RELATIVELY QUIET TIME
WHEN WE MADE IT, BUT RIGHT,OBVIOUSLY...
>> Jon: RIGHT. WHERE DID YOUMAKE IT?
>> WE MADE IT IN LONDON ANDMOROCCO.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT'S PROBABLYWHY IT WAS QUIETER.
LONDON AND MOROCCO.
>> BUT 2013 WAS QUIET IN ISRAELAND PALESTINE, TOO, QUIETER.
>> Jon: 20 YEARS. IT'S KINDA NOTQUIET.
>> NO, IT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, YOU,YOU, YOU GIVE A SPEECH IN THE
BEGINNING OF IT. YOURCHARACTER GIVES A SPEECH
ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEENISRAEL AND PALESTINE.
AND NO ONE SHOUTS YOU DOWN.
>> ARE PEOPLE GONNA POP UP WHENWE TALK ABOUT IT?
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO. BUT NOBODYSHOUTED YOU DOWN.
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IUNDERSTAND ARTISTIC LICENSE, BUT
PUSHING FICTION THAT FAR I THINKREALLY CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE.
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
SO FAR ACTUALLY ABOUT THIS SHOW,AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.
AND I'VE WATCHED YOU SHOW.
I KNOW IT'S BEENCOMPLICATED. AND I,
I HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY PUSHBACK AT ME AND BE REALLY UPSET.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.BUT I FEEL...
>> Jon: YOU HAVE VERYTHOUGHTFUL FRIENDS.
>> YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHATHAPPENS.
I THINK THERE WILL BE MOMENTS INIT WHEN PEOPLE THINK WE'VE GONE
TOO FAR...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO ONE SIDE OR TOO FARTO THE OTHER, BUT I THINK
ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW...
>> Jon: IT'S ABOUTUNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER AND
DRAMATIZING THAT.
>> WELL, IT'S ABOUT LAYING OUTASPECTS OF THE CONFLICT I THINK
AND ASKING THE AUDIENCE TO THINKABOUT IT.
>> Jon: UH-HUH.
>> AND SO FAR, ANYWAY, I MEAN,YOU KNOW, FOUR EPISODES HAVE
PLAYED IN LONDON, AND ACTUALLYTHE FOURTH EPISODE TAKES
PLACE IN GAZA AND PLAYEDLAST THURSDAY.
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS REALLYCURIOUS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND
HOW PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND.
AND I THINK... I DON'T KNOW.
SO FAR, I HOPE IT IS MAKINGPEOPLE THINK AND FEEL.
I DON'T KNOW.
>> Jon: THERE'S SOMETHINGCALLED TWITTER.
I THINK IF YOU CHECK IT, I THINKYOU'LL SEE.
>> YEAH, I KNOW.
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOUABOUT THE CHARACTER,
BECAUSE I'M ALMOST MOREINTERESTED IN, THOUGH, IN WHEN
YOU'RE MAKING IT, BECAUSE SOMUCH OF THIS IS... WHEN YOU'RE
CREATING SOMETHING ALONG THESELINES, IT'S ABOUT THE
PARTICIPANTS, THE ACTORS, THEWRITERS, THE DIRECTOR DISCUSSING
THESE ISSUES.
I IMAGINE THERE WAS A WIDEVARIETY OF OPINION ON SET.
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT THATMANIFESTED ITSELF?
AND WAS THAT AN INTERESTINGCONVERSATION?
>> I MEAN, I MEAN, I THINK INSOME WAYS THE WAY YOU'RE GOING
IN IS THE RIGHT WAY. LIKEBASICALLY,
WE MADE A PIECE OF ART. ICREATED A CHARACTER.
I TRIED TO CREATE A CHARACTERTHAT I HOPED WOULD SPEAK TO BOTH
SIDES. NOW, MAYBETHAT'S A FANTASY.
BUT I DO THINK IT'S A FANTASYTHAT'S WORTH HAVING,
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THAT'S WORTH EXPLORING,THAT'S WORTH CONSIDERING.
AND, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY NOW ATTHIS MOMENT WHERE IT FEELS
IMPOSSIBLE, WHERE IT'S REALLYSCARY TO TALK ABOUT, ESPECIALLY
IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, ITHINK, I THINK ART CAN BE ONE
WAY IN TO START TO THINKAND FEEL ABOUT THIS,
NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO,YOU KNOW, SOLVE ANYTHING...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT IF YOU CAN, IF YOU CANSHIFT SOMEONE A LITTLE TINY BIT,
IF THERE'S, YOU KNOW, IF YOUHAVE A, IF IT'S TOO SCARY TO
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SO MANYPEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S,
PEOPLE GET SO ANGRY ANDSTOP LISTENING, MAYBE, MAYBE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN MAKE YOUFEEL ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT
MAKES YOU THINK.
>> Jon: IS THAT WHEN YOU FIRSTINVOLVE YOURSELF IN IT, IS THAT
PART OF THE CALCULATION AND THEEQUATION? DO YOU THINK TO
YOURSELF, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT,THIS IS, THIS... THIS IS A NICE,
THIS IS A PARTICULARLYFRUITFUL AREA FOR ART TO
DELVE INTO BECAUSE IT'STOUCHING, YOU KNOW, THE MOST
VOLATILE HEART, YOU KNOW,IN SOME WAYS ON THE PLANET.
>> THAT'S WHY I THINK HUGO, WHOIS THE DIRECTOR, WHO IS A
GENIUS, IN MY OPINION, THAT'SWHY HE SET IT HERE ON SOME LEVEL
BECAUSE THERE IS ANIMPOSSIBILITY ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE IT IS THE HEART OFSOMETHING. AND IT, BUT
FOR ME, TO BE HONEST, I GOTINVOLVED AND EMOTIONALLY
ATTACHED TO WHAT'S HAPPENINGTHERE THROUGH MAKING IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I KNEW ABOUT AS MUCH AS YOUKNOW IF YOU KIND OF TRY READ THE
NEWSPAPER, LIKE I DO.
I DO MY BEST.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I HAVE TWO LITTLE KIDS, ANDI, YOU KNOW, I...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I, I NOW I AMCOMPULSIVELY READING ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
TRY TO KEEP THE KIDS AWAY FROMTHAT BECAUSE THAT, THAT IS A
TOUGH ONE TO EXPLAIN.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
>> TO THE LITTLE ONES.
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEEYOU. NEXT TIME WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT LIKE A KIDS'ANIMATED SERIES? SOMETHING LIKE
THAT. YOU COME BACK AND TALKABOUT THAT FOR A LITTLE?
>> SURE.
>> Jon: MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW...
>> I JUST CAME THE CHALLENGE YOUA LITTLE.
>> Jon: I KNOW.
