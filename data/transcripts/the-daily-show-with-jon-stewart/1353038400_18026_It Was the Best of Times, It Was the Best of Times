WOMEN.
>> Jon:  YEAH, THEY LOVED ( BLEEP ).
WHILE MITT ROMNEY BLAMED HIS LOSS ON OBAMA VOTERS' BRIBABILITY.
>> IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL AMERICA ANYMORE.
>> TRADITIONAL AMERICA AS WE KNEW IT IS GONE.
>> WARD, JUNE, WALLY, AND THE BEAV, OUT OF HERE.
>> YEAH, PRET MUCH.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YES.
YES, BILL.
OBAMA'S REELECTION MARKED THE MOMENT THAT TRADITIONAL AMERICA ENDED.
THE MOMENT WHEN THE FAMILY FROM THE 1950s SITCOM "LEAVE IT TO BEAVER," CEASED TO BE REAL.
YES, IT WAS A MOMENT WHEN--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRADITIONAL AMERICA-- OBAMA'S
REELECTION WAS THE MOMENT WHEN TRADITIONAL MREALIZED EVEN THEIR RICH WIVES COULDN'T SAVE THEM
FROM BEING REPLACED.
BILL O'REILLY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!
>> THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHANGING  CHANGING.
THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IS NOW THE MINORITY.
>> Jon:  YES, AS AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CHANGING.
AND THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT ALWAYS GIVING WAY TO-- AND PRESENTING-- A NEW ESTABLISHMENT,
MR. O'REILLY AND MR. GOLDBERG.
( LAUGHTER ) OR PERHAPS MR. O'REILLY IS FORGETTING THE-- HOLD ON-- 19th CENTURY.
(  LAUGHTER  ) WHEN PEOPLE WITH NAMES LIKE O'REILLY WERE DESCRIBED IN THE "CHRISTIAN EXAMINER" NEWSPAPER
WITH PHRASE LIKE, "THE ILL-CLAD IRISH MAN IS REPULSIVE TO OUR HABITS AND TASTES."
BY THE WAY, THE "CHRISTIAN EXAMINER" NEWSPAPER AT THAT TIME CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MORE
PROGRESSIVE NEWSPAPERS BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE IRISH TO BE HUMAN.
(  LAUGHTER  ) HERE'S "HARPER'S WEEKLY" ON THE 19th CENTURY THREAT TO TRADITIONAL WHITE MESH.
WE GAVE THEM LAND FWAGES FAR BETTER THAN THEY COULD OBTAIN AT HOME AND COME TO US STEEPED IN
IGNORANCE AND SUPERISTITION.
NEARLY 75% OF OUR CRIMINALS AND PAUPERS ARE IRISH." SEE, BILL, YOU GUYS TURNED MOST
OF THAT AROUND.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) AS FOR YOUR FRIEND BERNIE, I DID SEARCH MIGHT BE ROFEAR, THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND COULD NOT FIND ANY INSTANCES AT ANY POINT IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE
TRADITIONAL AMERICANS DIDN'T LIKE JEWS.
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.
I TRIED.
TURNS OUT, APPARENTLY, JEWS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN AMERICA AND ALWAYS BEEN LOVED AND ACCEPTED.
( LAUGHTER ) WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR CATHOLICISM.
>> ONLY ABOUT 30% OF AMERICANICALS NOW ATTEND WEEKLY MASS.
YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF CREEPING SECULARISM ON THE RELIGIOUS VOTE.
ON PAPER, THE STATS LOOK HOPELESS FOR TRADITIONAL AMERICANS.
>> Jon:  RIGHT, AS STATS ABOUT CREEPING CATHOLICISM IN THE 1840s LOOKED TO THE
AMERICAN SOCIETY TO PROMOTE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION OR A.S.P.P.P.R.
THEY HADN'T CRACKED THE ACRONYM THING THEN.
THEY FELT THE EXTENSION OF CATHOLICISM ENDANGERED AMERICAN FREEDOM AND BACK IN THE "LEAVE
IT TO BEAVER" DAYS THEY WOULDN'T EVEN ELECT A CATHOLIC PRESIDENT UNTIL J.F.K. GAVE A SPEECH
ENSURING PROTESTANT CLERGY HE WOULDN'T TAKE ORDERS FROM THE POPE.
HE WOULD TAKE ORDERS FROM SOMETHING THAT STARTS WITH A "P" AND RESEMBLES A WRINKLED OLD MAN
WEARING A HAT.
(  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) "ASK NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
LET'S JUST FIND SOME CHICKS." HOW DO YOU THINK TRADITIONAL AMERICANS WOULD HAVE REACTED TO
A MORMON CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT?
SEEING AS IN 1857, PRESIDENT BUCHANAN SENT THE ARMY TO UTAH TO FIGHT THEM.
BERNIE, BERNIE, BILL, FOX, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY SO MUCH.
... WHAT YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING IS THE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF AMERICA'S GREATEST TRADITION-- A
FEVERED RULING CLASS LAMENTING THE RISE OF A NEW ET CETERA NICKLY DIVERSE NEW CLASS ONE
THAT WILL DESTROY ALL THAT IS VIRTUOUS AND GOOD AND BRING THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT CRASHING TO
THE GROUND.
EXCEPT YOU'RE FORGETTING ONE THING-- THAT IS THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT.
AP ETHNIC GROUP ARRIVING ON AMERICA'S SHORES, TO BE REVILED, LIVING IN SCALLOR, OR IF THEY'RE
LUCKY, SCALLOR HEIGHTS.
(  LAUGHTER  ) WORKING HARD TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ( BLEEP ) ON THE
NEXT GROUP LANDING ON OUR SHORES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SO ENOUGH.
ENOUGH!
RELAX!
ENOUGH WITH THE LAMENTATIONS.
UNLESS YOUR REAL NAME IS SITTING BILL, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.
( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
