[APPLAUSE]JON:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.  WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, TORONTO STAR REPORTER ROBYN DOOLITTLE, HAS
WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT -- A GENTLEMAN NAMED ROB FORD,
APPARENTLY HE'S THE MAYOR OF TORONTO AND A CRACK AFICIONADO.
>> A STUNNING REPORT RELEASED BYTHE  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGETOFFICE.
>> A POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE CONGRESSIONAL REPORT.
>> A REPORT.
>> OH, MY GOD!  COULD IT BE TRUE?
HAVE THEY ACTUALLY RELEASED THE BIANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
OFFICE'S OUTLOOK ON THE BUDGET AND ECONOMY ENTITLED THE BUDGET
AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 2014 TO 2024, APPENDIX -- SNORING.
LABOR MARKET EFFECT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, A JACKREACHER
MYSTERY.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL ASLEEP
DURING THAT.  I WAS NEARLY A THIRD OF THE WAY
THROUGH THE TITLE.  I WONDER WHY THERE'S SO MUCH
EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE CBO REPORT.
>> CBO PROJECTING THE DEBACLE WILL COST NEARLY 2 1/2 MILLION
JOBS.
>> IS OBAMACARE KILLING THE AMERICAN DREAM.
>> AN EXTRA 1 TRILLION DOLLARS ADDED TO THE DEFICIT.
>> 10 TRILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEFICIT.
>> THEY WILL EMPLOY FAR FEWER FULL-TIME PEOPLE, MORE PART-TIME
PEOPLE.
>> IS THIS IS THE AMERICAN WAY?  I'M NOT SURE.
>> YOU SEEMED PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S NOT.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SMALL PROBLEM WITH THE APOCALYPTIC PREDICTIONS
FROM THE CBO IN THAT THE REPORT DID NOT IN ANY WAY SAY ANY OF
THOSE THINGS.
>> THE NET EFFECTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS TO REDUCE
OUR NATIONAL DEFICITS, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN.  >> YOU POINT OUT THERE'S NO
COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT HAS
INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, IS THAT
RIGHT?  >> YES, THAT'S RIGHT,
CONGRESSMAN.
>> IN OTHER WORDS, THIS ISN'T EMPLOYERS CUTTING JOBS, NEWLY
EMPOWERED WORKERS CHOOSING TO GOA DIFFERENT PATH.
>> YES.
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GUY WHO ISREADY TO GET [BLEEP] OUT OFTHERE
