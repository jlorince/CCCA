>> Jon: WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, GEORGE TAKEIIS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE
PROGRAM.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]OH, WHAT A DAY IN NEW YORK CITY.
NOW I KNOW THE TEMPERATURE ATWHICH TESTICLES MELT.
[LAUGHTER]IT IS NOT PLEASANT OUT, BUT
KUDOS TO THE AUDIENCE FOR EVENSHOWING UP HERE TONIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]ALTHOUGH, SAVE YOUR ENERGY
CAUSE YOU CAN'T STAY IN HEREALL NIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]WE HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OBAMACARE,WHICH...
[LAUGHTER]AFTER A NUMBER OF SETBACKS,
APPEARS TO BE OPERATING AS ITWAS INTENDED.
IT'S SMOOTH SAILING FOROBAMACARE.
>> BREAKING NEWS, THIS TIME ITCONCERNS OBAMACARE, AND
A DRAMATIC BLOW BYFEDERAL APPEALS COURT.
>> THIS IS A BIG BLOW TOOBAMACARE.
>> A HUGE BLOW.
>> HUGE BLOW TO THEADMINISTRATION.
>> BAD BLOW.
>> A MAJOR BLOW.
>> TOUGH BLOW.
>> SERIOUS BLOW.
>> A DEVASTATING BLOW.
>> AN ENORMOUS BLOW.
>> Jon: A LOT OF BLOWING!
[LAUGHTER]THERE IS SO MUCH BLOWING.
EVERYBODY IS BLOWING OBAMACARE.
[LAUGHTER]WHAT? WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
THAT WOULD SO DRAMATICALLY...ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
GET READY TO BE BLOWN.
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AFFORDABLECARE ACT PROVIDED FEDERAL TAX
CREDIT SUBSIDIES TO QUALIFIEDLOWER-INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO
SIGNED UP IN EXCHANGESESTABLISHED BY THE STATES.
BUT AS YOU KNOW, 36 STATES --THE REDDER ONES -- OPTED TO NOT
SET UP THOSE EXCHANGES, FORCINGTHEIR RESIDENTS ONTO FEDERAL
EXCHANGES, WHICH CAUSED ALAWSUIT AND THUS...
>> THE LAW DOESN'T EXPRESSLY SAYPEOPLE WHO GET THEIR INSURANCE
THROUGH FEDERAL EXCHANGES ALSOGET THOSE TAX CREDITS.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, I'M BEINGBLOWN.
YES, THEY... THEY FINALLY GOTOBAMACARE.
SEE, THE LAW SAYS YOU MUST BEENROLLED IN THROUGH AN EXCHANGE
ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE.
NOW, A NORMAL PERSON MIGHT SAY,DO YOU REALLY THINK THE LAW
INTENDED SUBSIDIES ONLY FORLOWER-INCOME CITIZENS OF STATES
THAT WEREN'T BEING DICKS ABOUTTHE EXCHANGES?
WELL, TWO OF THE THREE JUDGES INTHIS INSTANCE SAID, UH, YEAH.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT SENTENCELITERALLY.
I'M JUST HAPPY BOTH JUDGES GOTTO WORK THAT MORNING ASSUMING
THAT ONCE THEY HIT STOP SIGNSTHEIR DAY ENDS.
[LAUGHTER]NO, I HAVE TO... UNTIL THE LAW
EXPRESSLY PROVIDES A GOSIGN, WE CAN IN NO WAY
ASCERTAIN THE INTENT OFTHE FRAMERS OF THE SIGN.
SURELY THE PEOPLE HONKING BEHINDME APPRECIATE THE RIGOR OF MY
JUDICIAL  ACUMEN.
[BLEEPED] YOU TOO!
SO, NOW THAT THE TWO JUDGES MORELITERAL THAN AMELIA BEDELIA HAVE
RULED, WHAT NOW?
>> THIS RULING CREATES MOREPROBLEMS.
>> IT'S CHAOS, ISN'T IT?
>> THIS IS A MESS.
>> THIS IS A BLOODY MESS.
>> DEFINITELY SCRAMBLED THINGSUP.
>> CHAOS FOR THE INSURERS.
>> CHAOS AND CONFUSION.
>> CHAOS IN OBAMACARE.
>> ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE.
>> Jon: [SCREAMING] NOOO! THEREIS NO LAW.
EVERYONE FOR THEMSELVES.
IT IS THE END OF THE WORLD.
YOU BLEW IT UP.
OBAMACARE IS MADE OF PEOPLE.
[SCREAMING]>> BREAKING NEWS NOW, A SECOND
FEDERAL APPEALS COURT HASREACHED A CONFLICTING OPINION,
ANOTHER DECISION.
>> THEY DECIDED THAT THEOBAMACARE SUBSIDIES ARE LEGAL.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: [LAUGHING]
I HOPE YOU HAVE INSURANCE.
SO I GUESS AMERICA HASN'TDEVOLVED INTO A STATE OF
APOCALYPTIC CHAOS, BUT THE STATEEXCHANGE CLAUSE, OTHER APPEALS
COURT, PLEASE, WHAT ABOUT THESTATE EXCHANGE CLAUSE?
>> WHAT THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURTSAYS IS WHEN YOU READ THE
STATUTE AS A WHOLE, ANDTHIS WAS THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENT,IT SEEMS PRETTY
CLEAR THAT THAT'S CONGRESS,THAT'S WHAT CONGRESS WANTED.
>> Jon: RIGHT, BUT HOW ARE WESUPPOSED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
CONGRESS WANTED.
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING WHATOUR OBAMACARE FOREFATHERS
ORIGINALLY INTENDED.
I MEAN, THAT WAS WRITTEN BACK IN20 OT 9.
YOU'D NEED SOME SORT OF TIMEMACHINE TO FIND OUT WHAT
CONGRESS INTENDED OR A TIVO OR AWORKING TELEPHONE OR LEGS TO
WALK OVER AND ASK THEM.
SO WHAT EXPLAINS HOW TWODIFFERENT COURTS OFFER TWO
ENTIRELY DIFFERENTINTERPRETATIONS OF THE EXACT
SAME CLAUSE ON THE SAME EXACTDAY?
>> IN THE FIRST RULING TODAY, ATHREE-JUDGE PANEL, TWO
REPUBLICAN APPOINTED MEMBERS OFTHE FEDERAL D.C. CIRCUIT COURT,
IN THE OTHER FEDERALDECISION TODAY, THIS ONE
FROM THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OFAPPEALS, A THREE-JUDGE PANEL,
ALL APOINTED BY DEMOCRATS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
SO HOW DID THE REPUBLICAN JUDGESNOT UPHOLD OBAMACARE YET THE
DEMOCRATIC JUDGES DID?
I MEAN, I JUST WONDER WHAT --OH.
[LAUGHTER]OH, I GET IT NOW.
THE COURTS ARE JUST AN EXTENSIONOF OUR OWN BROKEN -- [CRYING]
IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT ONE OFTHOSE MAGIC EYE POSTERS.
AND YOU'RE LOOKING AND LOOKINGAND THEN FINALLY THE DOLPHIN
JUMPS OUT AT YOU, BUT INSTEAD OFA DOLPHIN, IT'S AN EVIL CLOWN
THAT SKULL [BLEEPED] OURFUNCTIONING OUR 200 AND SOME ODD
YEAR DEMOCRACY.
THE LAW IS ROTTEN. OUR JUDICIARY IS ROTTEN.
IS THERE ANYTHING, I SAY TOTHEE, THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY,
OUR WAY OF LIFE?
>> CONGRESS COULD CHANGE THEWORDING OF THE LAW ITSELF.
>> Jon: GO ON.
>> THE SECTION OF THE LAW THATAPPLIED TO CREATING A
STATE-BASED EXCHANGE IF THEY HADJUST ADDED ONE MORE SENTENCE,
YOU KNOW, OR ONE MORE CITATIONTO APPLY TO THOSE THAT ARE
EITHER IN PARTNERSHIP OR CREATEDBY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THIS
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE TELLING METHAT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN 36
STATES CAN BE SAVED FROMPOSSIBLE BANKRUPTCY OR
DEBILITATING LACK OF MEDICALCOVERAGE WITH THE ADDITION OF
ONE SENTENCE THAT SAYS, "YOU CANGET SUBSIDIES THROUGH EXCHANGE
SET UP BY THE STATE OR THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES."
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A FULLSENTENCE.
JUST ADD "OR HHS" ON THE END...
JUST TWO WORDS.
YOU COULD SALVAGE THIS ENTIRE[BLEEPED] THING WITH A MEDIOCRE
SCRABBLE HAND.
WELL, LET'S DO IT!
THAT'S...COME ON!
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT... ITELL YOU THIS, AS I STAND HERE
TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO MAKEIT, EVERYBODY.
>> THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAIDTODAY'S RULING IS ALSO FURTHER
PROOF THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'SHEALTH CARE LAW IS COMPLETELY
UNWORKABLE.
IT CANNOT BE FIXED.
>> Jon: WELL, I GUESS IT'SJUST YOU AND ME, OLD FRIEND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
