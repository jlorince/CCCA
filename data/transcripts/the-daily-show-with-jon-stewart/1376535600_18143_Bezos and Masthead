>> John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON
STEWART WHO HAS BEEN SPENDING
THE ENTIRE SUMMER AT TRAINING
CAMP WITH THE NEW YORK GIANTS.
APPARENTLY HE'S EXTREMELY HAPPY
AND IN ALMOST CONSTANT PAIN.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT TV LEGEND AND
HOST OF THE NEW SHOW CROWD GOES
WILD ON FOX 1 REGIS PHILBIN IS
HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, YES, INDEED.
WE START TONIGHT WITH THE NEWS
MEDIA.
NOW, PERSONALLY I GET ALL MY
NEWS FROM JON STEWART AND THE
DAILY SHOW.
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
THIS SUMMER.
BUT APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE GET
THEIR CURRENT AFFAIRS FROM
NEWSPAPERS.
OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM PAPER
TELEVISION.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE
THE "NEW YORK TIMES," THE WALL
STREET JOURNAL, OR WHATEVER THE
[BLEEP] THAT FREE THING IS THAT
PEOPLE SHOVE IN YOUR FACE
WHENEVER YOU GET INTO THE
SUBWAY.
THE POINT IS A FREE PRESS IS OF
COURSE THE BACKBONE OF A
DEMOCRACY.
BUT INCREASINGLY THAT FREE PRESS
HAS HAD QUITE A HIGH PRICE TAG.
>> THE "WASHINGTON POST," THE
CITY'S LEGENDARY YET STRUGGLING
NEWSPAPER SOLD TO ONE OF THE
COUNTRY'S WEALTHIEST MEN,
AMAZON.COM CHAIRMAN JEFF BEZOS.
>> THE "WASHINGTON POST" IS IS
NOW OWNED BY THE HEAD OF AMAZON
AND ITS 14 PRINT SUBSCRIBERS ARE
ALREADY NOTICING ONE DIFFERENCE
BECAUSE THE PAPER NOW COMES IN
LUDICROUSLY WASTEFUL PACKAGING.
BUT I WILL SAY THEY'VE MADE IT
MUCH EASIER TO RETURN THE NEWS
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
STILL, THIS ACQUISITION RAISES
SOME BIG QUESTIONS.
FIRST, HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE THAT
GUY'S NAME?
(PRONOUNCING IT DIFFERENTLY N) I
DON'T KNOW.
SECONDLY, ARE YOU SURE THAT THIS
IS A GOOD INVESTMENT?
>> FOR 0 YEARS THE "WASHINGTON
POST" HAS BEEN OWNED BY THE
GRAND FAMILY EARNING A
REPUTATION FOR TOP INVESTIGATIVE
JOURNALISM.
BUT LIKE MOST PAPERS, IT
STRUGGLED OVER THE PAST TEN
YEARS.
>> ITS CIRCULATION IS HALF WHAT
IT WAS IN '93.
>> IT LOST MORE THAN $50 MILLION
LAST YEAR.
>> John: OH, MY GOD.
I THINK I GET IT.
THIS IS JUST BEZOS' CAR WASH.
IT'S A FRONT FOR A MASSIVE METH
OPERATION.
SAY HIS NAME IT'S HE EUVMENT
SENBEZOS.
SO IF THIS IS NOT A MONEY MAKER,
WHY IS HE DOING THIS?
>> BEZOS CAN SPEND AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE
"WASHINGTON POST" WITHOUT REALLY
TAKING TOO MUCH OF A DENT IN HIS
OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE SO HE HAS
THE LEEWAY TO MAKE MAJOR
EXPERIMENTS.
>> John: NOW IT MAKES SENSE.
HE'S SO RICH IT JUST DOESN'T
MATTER.
IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION OF
WHY SO MUCH AS IT IS WHY THE
[BLEEP] NOT?
LET'S ALL JUST BE HAPPY THAT ALL
HE'S EXPERIMENTING ON IS PRINT
JOURNALISM AND HE'S NOT SPENDING
$250 MILLION TO CROSS BREED A
ROTWEILLER WITH A PEACH.
DELICIOUS AND VICIOUS.
SAY HELLO TO GEORGIA'S STATE
ANIMAL.
PART OF ME WONDERS, IF HE'S JUST
DOING THIS SO THAT HE CAN RUSH
INTO THE PRINTING ROOM AT 3:00
IN THE MORNING AND SCREAM, "STOP
THE PRESS" AND THEN CHUCKLE TO
HIMSELF AND SAY, IT WAS TOTALLY
WORTH IT AND THEN SHUT DOWN THE
NEWSPAPER.
I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT.
OR MAYBE HE GOT THE IDEA FROM
SOME OF HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS.
>> THE OWNER OF THE BOSTON RED
SOX IS BUYING THE GLOBE.
ERIC CURBNER HAS BOUGHT THE
REGISTER AND BILLIONAIRE WARREN
BUFFET HAS BOUGHT DOZENS OF
PAPERS.
>> John: BASICALLY THERE ARE
MORE PEOPLE CURRENT
