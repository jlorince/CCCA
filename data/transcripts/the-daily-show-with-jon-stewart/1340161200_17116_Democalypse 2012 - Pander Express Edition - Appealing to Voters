IOWA BEGINS THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND FLORIDA (bleep)S ALL OVER IT.
WE'RE JOINED BY WYATT AND JOHN OLIVER.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING HE IS.
WYATT YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN, JOHN YOU ARE EM EMBEDDED WITH THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN.
HOW DOES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAY IT'S JUST ELECTION YEAR PANDERING?
>> WHO WHO WHO, THEY WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THEY DIDN'T DO THIS FOR VOTES.
THEY DID IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
THAT BEING SAID, IMMIGRANT VOTERS WISH TO EXPRESS THEIR GRATITUDE AT THE POLLS THIS
NOVEMBER, THAT WOULD BE MUY, MUY BUENO, COMPREND SNERKS.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE RESPONSE FROM REPUBLICANS?
IS RESTRICTING VOTER ACCESS TO THE POLLS THE IDEA FOR THEM?
>> REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO STOP PEOPLE FROM VOTING THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE COLLEGE
STUDENT DOZEN IT SAFELY.
THEY'LL MERELY BE ASKED TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN URINE FOR DRUG TESTING PURPOSES, FOUR GALLONS
OF IT.
>> Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF URINE.
>> EXACTLY, JON, WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT IS ANNOUNCING TOMORROW THAT ALL CHILDREN OF
JEWISH MOTHERS ARE NOW DOCTORS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: WHAT?
CAN THE PRESIDENT DO IN A?
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO THAT?
>> OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT CAN DO THAT DR. STEWART.
CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY.
IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE.
IN 1954 PRESIDENT TRUMAN TURNED ALL OF AMERICANS FILIPINOS INTO PODIATRISTS.
>> Jon: I THINK THE DEMOCRATS TOOK FLORIDA WITH IN A.
THAT'S REALLY --
>> REPUBLICANS ARE RAISING THE VOTING AGE.
>> Jon: TO WHAT?
>> TO THAT PERIOD WHERE YOU ARE DEAD BUT YOUR FINGER NAILS AND HAIR STILL GROW.
ROMNEY BAPTIZED THOSE DEAD PEOPLE.
>> Jon: JOHN?
>> CATS CAN VOTE.
BIG ONES, LITTLE ONES, HOUSE AND WILD.
THEY CAN ADOPT CHILDREN AND GET MARRIED BUT THEY CAN VOTE.
REMEMBER KITTIES YES WE MEOW!
>> ALL POLLING PLACES ARE IN DOG HOUSES.
>> WE DON'T DO THAT TO THAT WOULD DELIBERATELY AILENCATE THE CAT VOTE!
>> Jon: AREN'T THEY CONCERNED THAT THIS TYPE OF SCORCHED EARTH
POLITICKING WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FIX THE PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA?
>> FIX THE PROBLEMS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> JON, THE PURPOSE OF ELECTION ISN'T TO FIX THE PROBLEMS FACING THE COUNTRY.
IT'S TO WIN!
>> RIGHT!
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
