>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE FORMER
CHAIR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL
OVERSIGHT PANEL FOR TARP.
SHE'S RUNNING FOR SENATE IN THE
GREAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM ELIZABETH WARREN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO SIGH.
>> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> Jon: LISTEN, YOU KNOW YOUR
OPPONENT SCOTT BROWN IN THE
SENATE RACE HAS SAID THE MEDIA
DOESN'T GIVE YOU TOUGH QUESTIONS
SO I'M GOING TO START YOU OFF
WITH ONE THAT I THINK IS VERY
DIFFICULT AND SOMEWHAT COMPLEX.
YOU ARE RUNNING FOR SENATE IN
MASSACHUSETTS.
YOU ARE IN NEW YORK RIGHT NEW.
WHO SAY BETTER QUARTERBACK TOM
BRADY OR ALLY MANNING.
>> I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT
TOM BRADY.
THE PATS ARE GOING TO SPANK THE
GIANTS.
>> Jon: NO!
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU.
SORRY IT'S JUST REALITY.
>> Jon: IT'S JUST REALITY.
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO WAFFLE
LIKE A LITTLE.
DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
BEING A PL TITION YET?
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO I RESPECT
THE GIANTS GREATLY.
>> BUT I DON'T.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S PATS ALL THE WAY.
>> Jon: ELI MANNING HAS
LEPROSY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
WE DID EARLY ON IN THE SHOW
ABOUT THE TAX ISSUE WITH MITT
ROMNEY.
THIS IS THE THING SO FRUSTRATING
TO ME.
MITT ROMNEY SAYS LOOK I'M
LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PAY THIS
AMOUNT.
I DON'T PAY A DOLLAR MORE.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IF YOU CHANGE THE SYSTEM.
THEY TRIED.
THAT'S THE PART HE DOESN'T
INCLUDE.
THEY TRIED TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM.
THEY TRIED TO REPEAL THAT
CARRIED INTEREST IS ONLY TAX AT
15%.
HE AND THE OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY
FUNDS FOUGHT IT TOOTH AND NAIL.
LE IS THAT -- HOW -- WHY IS
THAT -- HOW ARE THEY ALLOWED TO
MAKE THAT HAPPEN?
TNCHES A BIG AND SYSTEMIC
PROBLEM HERE.
I GREW UP IN AN AMERICA THAT WAS
STILL INVESTING IN THE MIDDLE
CLASS.
THAT WAS THE PRINCIPLE FUNCTION
OF WASHINGTON AND HOW IT SPENT
MONEY.
IT SAID WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN
AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS.
THE DAUGHTER OF A GUY WHO SOLD
FENCING.
>> Jon: YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIS
NAME?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT WE
CHANGED FROM THAT WORLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> Jon: WE'RE BACK NOW.
>> ALL RIGHT WE'RE BACK.
>> Jon: ARE YOU SAYING THAT --
WHY ARE YOU SAYING WE DON'T
INVEST ANYMORE?
HAS THE GOVERNMENT ABDICATED
THAT RESPONSIBILITY?
DO WE NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO DO
IT?
DO WE NOT THINK IT'S A PRIORITY?
>> WHAT HAPPENED IS WASHINGTON
NOW WORKS FOR THOSE WHO CAN HIRE
AN ARMY OF LOBBYISTS AND
LAWYERS.
IF YOU ARE IN THE DRUG BUSINESS
AND YOU ARE SELLING
PRESCRIPTIONS TO SENIORS AND YOU
DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
OVER THE PRICES, WASHINGTON
WORKS BEAUTIFULLY FOR YOU.
IF YOU WANT SUBSIDIES TO DRILL
FOR OIL, WASHINGTON IS WORKING
FOR YOU.
IF YOU RUN A HEDGE FUND AND WANT
TO PAY THE LOWEST POSSIBLE
TAXES, WASHINGTON IS WORKING FOR
YOU.
THERE WAS A RECENT WILL YOU A
STUDY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
WEEKS.
THERE WAS A STUDY IN WHICH IT
COMES OUT THAT 30 OF THE LARGEST
COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES
ARE NOW SPENDING MORE ON
LOBBYING THAN THEY PAY IN
FEDERAL TAXES.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
THINK ABOUT THAT.
THAT IS THE INVESTMENT AND
THAT'S WHAT THEY SEE AS THE
FUTURE.
>> Jon: THEY ARE THE ONES
WRITING THE COMPLEX TAX CODE.
THEY WOULD PRETEND SEE THIS IS
SO ONEROUS FOR US.
WE HAVE TO HIRE THOSE PEOPLE.
THEY HIRE THOSE PEOPLE TO MAKE
IT ONEROUS SO THEY CAN WORM
THEIR WAY THROUGH, YES?
>> THAT'S RIGHT BUT HERE IS THE
OTHER PART TO THE STORY.
WHO REALLY PAYS FOR THAT?
THE ANSWER IS AMERICA'S MIDDLE
CLASS.
THEY ARE THE ONES LEFT TO PICK
UP ALL THE PIECES TO PAY THE
TAXES TO KEEP THE COUNTRY
RUNNING.
AND MORE TO THE POINT, THEY ARE
THE ONES WHO ARE NOW PAYING FOR
THE FACT THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
MONEY LEFT TO INVEST IN OUR
KIDS' FUTURE.
LISTEN TO THIS --
>> Jon: YOU ARE NOT MAD AT ME
ABOUT THIS?
IT SEEMS LIKE -- FOR A SECOND IT
SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE A LITTLE MAD
AT ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS.
RIGHT NOW CHINA INVESTS 9% OF
THE ITS G.D.P. IN
INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, BRIDGES
THINGS THAT BUILD THE FUTURE.
EUROPE INVESTING 5% OF ITS
G.D.P. IN INFRASTRUCTURE.
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES 2 HAD
THE 4% AND TRYING TO -- 2.4% AND
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CUT.
RESEARCH -- WAIT RESEARCH!
>> Jon: I'M IN THE LEAVING.
THIS IS MY SHOW.
>> GOOD.
>> Jon: I'M NOT GOING TO GO
ANYWHERE.
>> RESEARCH, A KEY PART, RIGHT,
OF WHAT GIVES YOU THE PIPELINE
FOR GREAT IDEAS OF THE FUTURE.
AS A PROPORTION OF G.D.P. WE CUT
IT IN HALF FROM WHAT WE WERE
SPENDING IN THE 60s.
IN EDUCATION WE'RE SLASHING WHAT
WE SPEND ON PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, THE THINGS
THAT GIVE BOOT STRAPPER KIDS A
CHANCE TO MAKE IT.
>> Jon: WHY ARE WE CHASING
CORPORATION CONDITIONS TO
COMPETE WITH CHINA?
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO.
WE SAW IT ON FOX THEY LIVE IN
DORMS AND THEY GET PEOPLE TO
WORK 12 HOUR SHIFTS FOR A
BISCUIT AND CUP OF TEA.
WE CAN'T CUT THE CORPORATE RATE.
IT AIN'T COMING BACK.
WE HAVE TO SOMETHING OUT, RIGHT?
NOW I'M MAD AT YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WE ONLY FIGURE SOMETHING OUT
IF WE INVEST IN THE MIDDLE
CLASS, INVEST IN OURSELVES AND
OUR FUTURE.
WE LIVE IN A WORLD --
>> Jon: YES.
>> YOU WATCH IT.
>> Jon: LET ME GO TO
COMMERCIAL.
CAN YOU STAY FOR TWO SECONDS AND
IT WILL GO ON THE WEB.
IT'S A GREAT TEASER IT'S LIKE
ONE OF SOAP OPERAS LIKE OH, MY
GOD DID THEY DIE?
WE'LL DO IT LIKE THAT.
WILL YOU STAY?
>> I'LL STAY.
