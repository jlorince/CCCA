THE POINT IS, THESE OPEN CARRYDEMONSTRATIONS DREW A LOT OF
ATTENTION, INCLUDE FROM THE OPENCARRY DEATH STAR ITSELF THEN.R.A.
>> THE NATION'S MOST VOCAL GUNADVOCACY GROUP CONDEMNED THE
ACTIVISTS SAYING USING GUNSMERELY TO DRAW ATTENTION TO
YOURSELF IN PUBLICNOT ONLY DEFIES
COMMON SENSE, IT SHOWS A LACK OFCONSIDERATION AND MANNERS.
>> Jon: ONCE AGAIN, THE N.R.A.
BLINDLY -- WAIT WHAT?
THAT SOUNDED VAGUELY REASONABLE!
(LAUGHTER)WILL OPEN CARRY LISTEN?
>> ON MONDAY, OPEN CARRY TEXASTHREATENED TO WITHDRAW ITS
SUPPORT FOR THE N.R.A. AND, TOUNDERSCORE THAT POINT, IT POSTED
A PHOTO OF AN N.R.A. MEMBERSHIPCARD CUT UP.
>> Jon: OPEN CARRY, I DON'TWANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR
BUSINESS, BUT YOU'RE SITTING ONA BUNKER FULL OF ASSAULT RIFLES
AND YOU USE SCISSORS? THAT'S HOWYOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)SHOULDN'T THAT NRA CARD HAVE A
HOLE THROUGH IT SOMEWHERE?
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF SYMBOLISMPLEASE?
WELL, GUESS WHAT, BUDDIES?
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUINSTAGRAMED YOUR LITTER TO THE
N.R.A. -- IT'S IS THE N.R.A.!
THEY STAND THEIR GROUND!
>> THE TRUTH IS AN ALERT WENTOUT THAT REFERRED TO THIS TYPE
OF BEHAVIOR AS WEIRD OR SOMEHOWNOT NORMAL, AND THAT WAS A
MISTAKE.
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
THE TRUTH IS -- AND I'LL BECRYSTAL CLEAR -- THE NATIONAL
RIFLE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS OPENCARRY.
>> Jon: WOW.
EVERYONE IS SCARED OF GUN NUTS.
EVEN OTHER GUN NUTS.
(LAUGHTER)GUN NUTS -- THAT'S FUNNY!
GUN NUTS ARE FUNNY!
(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
WHAT IF YOU GOT GUN NUTS FOR ANEW GUN?
(LAUGHTER)YEAH, AS THEY GET OLDER -- WHAT
WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
YOU KNOW, THE ONE GROUP THAT WEHAVEN'T HEARD FROM IN THIS
SCENARIO ARE THE PEOPLE WHOWITNESS THESE OPEN CARRY
DEMONSTRATIONS, HOW DO THEYFEEL?
>> IT SCARED ME JUST SEEING THEMOUT THERE.
THEY HAVE GUNS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW HOW TOUSE IT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE BADINTENTIONS.
>> Jon: THAT IS A GOOD POINT.
YOU AS AN OPEN CARRY GUY MAYKNOW YOU'RE A GOOD GUY WITH A
GUN, BUT MEMBERS OF THE NATIONALEVERYBODY ELSE ASSOCIATION, THEY
HAVE NO IDEA.
KIND OF WHY THE POLICE WEARUNIFORMS.
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPENDTHEIR ENTIRE DAY GOING,
"EVERYBODY IT'S OK!
I'M A GOOD GUY!
STOP RUNNING!"
(LAUGHTER)SO WHEN YOU GO INTO THESE PLACES
OPEN CARRYING, CLEARLY OTHERPEOPLE FEEL THREATENED.
WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BEALARMED, AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO
THEIR OWN FEELINGS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: AND, SO, WE HAVE
ARRIVED AT OUR DESTINATION.
WHERE THE N.R.A. HAS PUT US INSOMEWHAT OF A QUANDARY, A
CONUNDRUM, A PICKLE.
BY THE WAY, TRY TO PICKLECONUNDRUMS AND CHILES, THEY
TAKE ALL THE PORKCHACHOS YOUDIDN'T EAT SOAK THEM IN CHEESE
BRINE, SEDATE YOU ANDFORCE THE MIXTURE THROUGH A
CATHETER IN YOUR PEE HOLE(LAUGHTER)
IT'S CALLED THE DEVIL'SAPPETIZER AND IT'S $4.95!
ARBY'S, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
THE N.R.A. HERE'S WHERE WE ARE,THE N.R.A.
AND THE OPEN CARRY FOLKS SUPPORTTHE RIGHT TO CARRY WEAPONS
WHEREVER YOU WANT, EVEN IF THOSEWEAPONS ARE GOING TO TERRIFY
EVERYONE AROUND YOU.
HERE'S WHAT ELSE THEY SUPPORT.
>> THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS ABAD GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY
WITH A GUN.
>> Jon: SEE WHERE WE ARE?
WE HAVE A MEXICAN STANDOFFHERE.
WELL, A TEX-MEXICAN REALLY. WEARE AT THE INTERSECTION OF OPEN
CARRY ROAD AND STANDYOUR GROUND PLACE.
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.
>> THIS IS LEGAL. IF YOU WANT TODO THIS, YOU CAN.
IF YOU DON'T USE YOUR RIGHTS,YOU'LL LOSE THEM.
>> IT SCARES PEOPLE TO SEE ABUNCH OF GUYS WITH HUGE GUNS.
>> STAND YOUR GROUND.
WHAT THAT LAW SAYS IS IF YOU'REACTING IN REASONABLE BELIEF OF
FEAR OF GREAT BODILY INJURY ORDEATH, THEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO
RESPOND TO THAT WITH DEADLYFORCE.
>> THIS DUTY TO RETREAT MAYSOUND FINE IN AN IVY LEAGUE
COCKTAIL PARTY, BUT IT DOESN'TWORK VERY WELL IN THE REAL WORLD
OF CRIME VICTIMS.
SO WHAT THE (BLEEP) ARE WESUPPOSED TO DO NOW!
ACCORDING TO THE N.R.A.'S BASICPRINCIPLES, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO
CARRY A WEAPON THAT MAY CAUSE AREASONABLE PERSON TO BELIEVE
THEY ARE IN DANGER OF GREATBODILY INJURY, AND THEY HAVE A
RIGHT, IF THEY FEEL THAT WAY, TORESPOND WITH DEADLY FORCE!
IT'S A PERPETUAL VIOLENCEMACHINE!
IT'S GUN FIGHT AT THE GOLDENCORRAL!
WAIT A MINUTE...
THIS ISN'T AN ARGUMENT ABOUTFREEDOM AT ALL, IS IT?
THIS WHOLE THING'S A [BEEP]BUSINESS PLAN FOR ARMS DEALERS!
SON OF A -- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
