>> Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY!
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
WE'VE GOT --
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
EIGHT MORE SHOWS!
HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, MY GUESTTONIGHT WAS GOING TO BE TEXAS
REPUBLICAN SENATOR TED CRUZ!
GUESS WHAT?
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT!
APPARENTLY, HE HAD TO BE IN THESENATE TO VOTE ON SOME --
(BLEEP).
SO HE COULDN'T MAKE IT!
SO WE CALL HIM, NOW -- HERE'STHE THING -- TYPICALLY, IF
SOMEBODY CANCELS AT THE LASTMINUTE, YOU THINK, I'LL NEVER
GET ANYBODY INTERESTING TO TALKTO.
THERE'S A GUY RUNS A SUBWAYSANDWICH SHOP RIGHT UP THE BLOCK
THERE.
I GO IN THERE AND I WILL BE,LIKE, WHAT IS THAT SMELL?
HE WOULD BE, LIKE, BREAD, ANDTHEN WE ALSO HAVE THE HORSE
CARRIAGE OVER THERE.
SO WHENEVER I WALK INTO THEBUILDING, THE TWO ODORS
GENERALLY COME TOGETHER AT THEDOOR, AND I END UP THINKING TO
MYSELF, " I COULD REALLY GO FORA (BLEEP) SANDWICH RIGHT NOW."
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSEWE HAVE AN EVEN BETTER GUEST!
THE GREAT HISTORIAN, ONE OF MYFAVORITES, DAVID McCULLOUGH,
IS GONNE BE JOINING US WITH HIS BOOK "THE WRIGHT BROTHERS"!
SO, YES!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT COULD BE A BETTER GIFT ON AMONDAY KICKING OFF MY FINAL
EIGHT SHOWS.
MAN, THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THANTALKING TO AN HISTORIAN, A
NON-FICTION WRITER.
A GREAT WAY TO START THE FINALRUN.
BUT, WE MUST TURN  FIRST --  AND I'M SORRY TO DO THIS, BUT AS
A HARD-HITTING NEWS PROGRAM,WE TURN TO I.S.I.S., OR AS
THEY'RE THEIR OWN I.S.I.L ORDA'ISH OR THE WORST PEOPLE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN ON YouTube.
>> THE NEW TERROR WARNING FROMTHE HEAD OF THE F.B.I.
I.S.I.S. IS NOW A  BIGGER THREATTO THE UNITED STATES THAT
AL QAEDA.
>> I.S.I.L. IS NOT YOUR PARENTSAL QAEDA.
>> Jon: ARE YOU ACCUSING MYPARENTS OF BEING AL QUAED?
BECAUSE THAT WOULD NOT HAVEGONE OVER WELL AT THEIR TEMPLE.
MMMM... MA NISHTA-WHA?
SO WHAT MAKES THE F.B.I. -- THEFEDERAL BEURU OF INVESTIGATION
-- THINK I.S.I.S. ISN'T LAMELIKE AL QAEDA AND DOESN'T DRIVE
AN OLDSMOBILE?
>> THE REASON I.S.I.S. HASSURPASSED AL QAEDA AS A DANGER
TO THE U.S. IS BECAUSE IT HASMASTERED TWITTER AND OTHER
SOCIAL MEDIA.
>> THE I.S.I.L TWEETERS IN SYRIAHAVE 21,000 ENGLISH LANGUAGE
FOLLOWERS.
>> Jon: OOH!
21,000!
GUESS WHAT?
PINK BERR'S GOT 49,000.
MY GUESS, OUT OF THE 21,000 MOSTIS FOLLOWBACKS FROM MORNING SHOW
DJs.
"HEY! IT'S FOLLOW-BACK MONDAY!"
>> IF YOU WANT TO TALK WITHTERRORISTS, THEY'RE RIGHT THERE
DIRECT MESSAGING FOR YOU TOCOMMUNICATE WITH.
>> Jon: OH.
TERRORISTS HAVE ONLINE CUSTOMERSUPPORT!
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY SURPASSEDAL QAEDA, BUT THEY'RE BEATING
THE (BLEEP) OUT OF TIME WARNER!
BOOM!
WAHH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT HAD TO HURT.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO FIGHTBACK AGAINST I.S.I.L'S TECHNICAL
SUPREMACY?
PERHAPS A VIRUS TO WIPE OUTCOMPUTERS?
HIJACK THEIR SOCIAL MEDIAACCOUNTS?
SOME KIND OF TARGETEDELECTROMAGNET PULSING?
>> THESE LEAFLETS, AIR-DROPPEDIN  TARAFA BY THE U.S., THE
MESSAGE: FREEDOM WILL RISE -- ANOT SO SUBTLE WARNING TO
I.S.I.S., WATCH OUT.
>> Jon: ARE YOU (BLEEP)KIDDING ME?
LEAFLETS?
LEAFLETS?
THAT IS OUR NEWEST COMMUNICATIONWEAPON IN THE GREATEST WAR OF
THE 21st CENTURY, DROPPEDLEAFLETS, FLOATING PAPER.
(LAUGHTER)
REALLY, I.S.I.S.?
YOU'RE DOMINATING SOCIALMEDIA, WELL, LET'S JUST SEE IF
CRANKING UP THE OLD MIMEOGRAPHCAN TAKE CARE OF THAT!
EVERY TURN OF THE HANDLE IS --OH, I'M SORRY.
WE'RE OUT OF INK AND I'M TIREDAND, TURNS OUT, NOBODY READS
LEAFLETS.
WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE NOT MYPARENTS' AL QAEDA.
SO AMERICA, ARMED WITH DITTOMACHINES, IS UP AGAINST A GROUP
THAT IS DISRUPTING THE WHOLECONCEPT OF DISRUPTION!
>> THEY PUT OUT A GENERALIZEDMESSAGE, IT'S THE MONTH OF
RAMADAN, IF YOU SEE AN INFIDELOR QUFAR WHERE YOU ARE, TAKE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO KILL THEM AND DOTHIS.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
I.S.I.S. FAN-BOYS ARE GOING INTOOPERATION FROM BOTTOM UP.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CALL CROWDSOURCE JIHAD.
>> Jon: INTERESTING.
SO THROUGH TECHNOLOGY, I.S.I.S.DOESN'T CARRY OUT ACTUAL JIHAD
THEMSELVES, THEY PUT TERRORINDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TOGETHER
WITH TERROR VICTIMS.
THEY'RE A TERROR UBER, IF YOUWILL.
(LAUGHTER)
12 MINUTES TO A CAR BOMB?
I'LL JUST WALK.
BUT WHO HAS TIME --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD NIGHT -- I'M JUST GOING TOLEAVE NOW.
I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE NOW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR A GOODHIGH NOTE AND JUST (BLEEP) BOLT.
I WANT TO GO OUT ON A HIGH NOTE.
OF COURSE, I.S.I.S. CLAIMS TO BEDOING ALL THESE THINGS.
BUT WHAT DOES THE AVERAGE JOESIX-PACKS-ARE-FORBIDDEN THINK?
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MOSUL WHOSAY THEY ARE BETTER OFF UNDER
THE ISLAMIC STATE.
ALMOST ALL ARE SUNNI AND THEYHAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF
THE IRAQ SHIITE GOVERNMENT.
>> PEOPLE DON'T LIKE I.S., BUTTHEY LIKE THEY'RE SECUIRTY.
INSTEAD OF ANARCHY, THEY HAVENOW LAW AND ORDER.
>> Jon: LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT -- SUNNI PEOPLE IN IRAQ
ARE ACCEPTING A BRUTALLYREPRESSIVE MURDEROUS, MEDIEVAL
TALIBAN-LIKE STATE BECAUSE IT'SBETTER THAN THE GOVERNMENT WE
LEFT THEM WITH?
(LAUGHTER)
GUESS WHAT -- THIS GATEDTERRORIST COMMUNITY HERE IS
ABOUT TO COME-A-TUMBLING DOWN.
>> TURKEY STEPS UP ITS FIGHTAGAINST I.S.I.S.
>> Jon: BOOM!
ACTUALLY, I WAS UNDER THEIMPRESSION TURKEY ALREADY HAD
SINCE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NEXTDOOR NEIGHBORS.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ISTURKEY'S ANIT-I.S.I.S
CAPABILITIES JUMPED UP FROM"STEP UP 2" STATUS, ALL THE WAY
TO "STEP UP REVOLUTION," NOTEVEN BOTHERING TO STOP AT "STEP
UP 3-D," THOUGH THE LASER GLOVESWOULD COME IN HANDY HAS TURKEY
STEPS IT'S STRATEGY TO THEMAXIMUM OR "ALL-IN" LEVEL.
SO WHAT DOES TURKEY STEPPING UPENTAIL.
>> IN SYRIA TURKISH WARPLANESBOMBED I.S.I.S. FOR THE FIRST
TIME.
A MAJOR TACTICAL SHIFT FOR THETURKS.
>> IN WHAT IS CALLED A GAMECHANGER, TURKEY GAVE THE  U.S.
PERMISSION TO USE A BASE IN THATCOUNTRY TO CRAIR OUT AER
AIRSTRIKES AGAINST I.S.I.S.
>> THE INVOLVEMENT OF TURKEY ISA GAME CHANGER.
>> Jon: OH, (BLEEP)!
WE JUST CHANGED THE GAME!
YOU THOUGHT WE WERE PLAYINGRISK, I.S.I.S.!
BUT WE'RE NOT!
WE'RE PLAYING LIKE SETTLERS OFCATAN.
AND THE GOOD GUYS JUST CORNEDTHE MARKET ON MOTHER(BLEEP)
SHEEP.
BY THE WAY, THAT STRATEGY BOARDGAME WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
NERDS.
NERDS: THEY LIKE TO HAVE FUN,INSIDE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND NOW -- AND NOW YOU KNOW OURCORE AUDIENCE.
TELL ME ABOUT THIS GAME CHANGINGAIRSTRIKE TURKEY IS LAUNCHING.
>> SO FA, MOST OF TURKEY'SAIRSTRIKES HAVE BEEN AGAINST
THE PRO-AMERICAN KURDS.
>> Jon: SO THEY'RE STEPPING UPTHE FIGHT AGAINST I.S.I.S. BY
TAKING OUT THE PEOPLE MOSTEFFECTIVELY FIGHTING
I.S.I.S.?
BRILLIANT STRATEGY.
CERTAINLY NO ONE WILL SEE THATCOMING.
>> THE TURKS SEE THE KURDS ASSEPARATISTS AND TERRORISTS.
THE U.S. VIEWs THE KURDS AS veryEFFECTIVE FIGHTERS.
IT'S MAKING THIS A VERY COMPLEX BATTLEFIELD, AVERY DELICATE
MILITARY DANCE FOR THE UNITEDSTATES.
>> Jon: -- VERY DELICATE DANCE.
MUCH LIKE WHEN ELIZABETHBENNETT ATTENDED THE
NETHERFIELD BALL HOPING TO DANCEWITH WICKHAM ONLY TO FIND OUT
DOROTHY SCARED HIM AWAY,REQUIRING HER TO SPEND ENTIRELY
TOO MUCH TIME PAIRED OFF WITHMR. COLLINS, AND THEN EVERYONE
PULLED OUT A KNIFE ANDDECAPITATED EACH OTHER!
(LAUGHTER)
SPOILER ALERT!
SO TURKEY IS HELPING US IN THEFIGHT AGAINST I.S.I.S. WHILE
BOMBING OUR ALLIES IN THE FIGHTAGAINST I.S.I.S.
AS CONFUSING AS IT GETS, WE CANREST ASSURED THAT NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS, THE KURDSULTIMATELY GET (BLEEP).
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
