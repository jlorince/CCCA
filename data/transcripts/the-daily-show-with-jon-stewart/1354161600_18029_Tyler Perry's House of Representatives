CAMPAIGN LOSS?
IT'S UNIMAGINABLE.
(LAUGHTER) SO WHY IS JOHN McCAIN DOING THIS?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS REPRESENTATIVE MARCIA
FUDGE-- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME-- (LAUGHTER) MARCIA.
(LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, CONGRESSWOMAN FUDGE IS ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST HARDWORKING AND I CAN ONLY
ASSUME DELICIOUS CONGRESS PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER) SHE HAD A THEORY ABOUT AMBASSADOR RICE.
>> ANY TIME SOMETHING GOES WRONG THEY PICK ON WOMEN AND MINORITIES.
>> COME ON NOW!
>> I HAVE A REAL ISSUE WITH THAT.
SUSAN RICE'S COMMENTS DIDN'T SEND US TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
>> UH-HUH!
>> WELL --
>> SOMEBODY ELSE'S DID.
I'M PROBABLY NOT THE MOST EDUCATED PERSON IN THIS HOUSE.
>> YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY.
>> BUT I'M CLOSE.
JUST GO ON AND HATE ON.
BUT LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND HATE YOURSELF, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK.
THANK YOU.
UH-HUH!
>> Jon:OOOH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST OF ALL, WHY ISN'T EVERY PRESS CONFERENCE LIKE THAT?
(LAUGHTER) A PRESS CONFERENCE INFUSED WITH LIFE AND EMOTION.
SHE JUST TURNED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES INTO TYLER PERRY'S "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ONLY PROBLEM IS -- THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I THINK THEY MIGHT BE WRONG.
>> UH-HUH.
>> YOU KNOW IT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
UH-HUH.
>> Jon: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I HUMBLY DISAGREE THE CAUCUS.
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, HE HUMBLY DISAGREES WITH THE CAUCUS, UH-HUH.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT -- JOHN, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING.
YOU JUST REPEATED WHAT I SAID.
>> I'M JUST REPEATING WHAT HE SAYS, UH-HUH.
I DO IT.
I DO IT.
>> JON, CAN I HELP HERE?
>> Jon: JESSICA, COULD YOU PLEASE?
>> I COME FROM BLACK CHURCHES.
IT'S NOT ABOUT REPEATING SOMETHING, IT'S ABOUT FEELING SOMETHING.
>> YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL IT!
>> YOU CAN'T FORCE IT!
>> IT'S A CALL AND RESPONSE.
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION WHEN REALLY YOU'RE NOT.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
>> HEY, I DO NOT HEAR A WORD YOU SAID!
>> Jon: .
>> WHOA!
YOU DON'T THINK I'LL GET THIS?
BELIEVE ME, HAVE YOU GUYS EVER SEEN THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IN BRITAIN?
THAT PLACE IS THE WHITEST BLACK CHURCH YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
(APPLAUSE)
>> FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MARGARET THATCHER.
>> HERE!
>> YES!
>> HERE, HERE!
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> OKAY, NOW, ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: I LOVE IT.
NOW, LISTEN, I'M NOT SAYING THE NOVA SCOTIA OVER AMBASSADOR RICE DOESN'T HAVE RACE AS AN INGREDIENT.
>> COME ON NOW, COME ON.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT ONLY IN THE SAME WAY THAT RACE AND SEXISM PLAY A SUBTLY CORROSIVE PART IN NEARLY
ALL OF OUR DISCOURSE.
>> PREACH!
>> TELL THE TRUTH.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Jon: THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, INCLUDING THE BEAUTIFULLY NAMED REPRESENTATIVE
FUDGE --
>> OH, YEAH, FUDGE.
FUDGE.
>> COME ON, KEEP IT COMING!
>> WHAT YOU GOT NOW?
(LAUGHTER)
>> SO MUCH FUDGE!
(LAUGHTER)
>> FORGET ABOUT IT!
>> FUDGE IT OUT.
>> Jon: THEY GET EXCITED ABOUT FUDGE.
>> UH-HUH.
>> Jon: BUT, SEE, THEY'RE JUST -- THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS IS JUST TRYING TO PUT
McCAIN AND GRAHAM'S INCOHERENT ATTACK ON RICE IN A COHERENT FRAME.
THIS ISN'T RACISM OR SEXISM.
>> NO, IT AIN'T!
>> Jon: IT'S INDISKRIM THAT THE BILE.
MEANING IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE.
>> NO, IT DON'T.
>> Jon: NOW, I'M PROBABLY NOT THE MOST EDUCATED PERSON ON COMEDY CENTRAL.
>> NO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE COLBERT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: .
>> YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT!
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT!
>> Jon: I'M PROBABLY THE SECOND.
>> THAT'S THE SOUTH PARK GUYS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: PROBABLY THE THIRD, I THINK I'M THE THIRD.
>> NO, THERE'S TWO OF THEM!
>> Jon: I'M THE FORTH.
>> DON'T FORGET MY BOY TOSH.
>> I'M THE FIFTH!
>> TOSH IS HELL LA SMART, Y'ALL.
>> Jon: MOTHER (BLEEP).
I'M STARTING TO THINK THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL.
>> THAT SPUN OUT OF CONTROL REAL QUICK, DIDN'T IT?
>> WITH THE QUICKNESS!
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU STOP HYPE CREWS, BY ANY CHANCE?
>> YOU DON'T, THIS TRAIN IS GONE.
TOOT TOOT CHUGA-CHUGA.
>> CAN'T STOP IT.
>> COME ON!
>> I'LL KEEP IT ROLLING.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> COME ON NOW!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
