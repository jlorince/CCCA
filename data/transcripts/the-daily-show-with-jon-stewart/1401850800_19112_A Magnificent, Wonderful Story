VERY EXCITING.
BUT FIRST, VERY BIG STORY BROKECONCERNING OUR NOW TEENAGE WAR
IN AFGHANISTAN. OBVIOUSLY, THE
TEENAGE YEARS ARE TOUGH FOREVERYBODY ESPECIALLY WARS.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED.

ABOUT FIVE YEARS WAS RELEASED BYTHE TALIBAN.

WONDERFUL.
SO IF IT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONEHERE I THINK WE SHOULD RIDE THIS
PATRIOT TRAIN TO [BEEP] YEAHJUNCTION.

HE WILL GET TO GO BACK TO HISLOVING PARENTS IN IDAHO.
BUT, IT'S A COMPLICATED CASE.

WHAT'S COMPLICATED ABOUTAMERICA RULES?
WE GOT OUR LAST P.O.W. BACK.
DID YOU NOT SEE THE BLUE BIRD?

COMPLICATED HOW?
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ISSTANDING BY IT'S DECISION
TO RELEASE FIVE SENIOR MEMBERSFROM GUANTANAMO BAY IN
A PRISONER EXCHANGE FORBERGDAHL.
>> THEY HAVE, IN FACT,NEGOTIATED WITH TERRORISTS.
AND, I DON'T THINK THEYGOT A VERY GOOD DEAL.
>> JON:  WOW, I DON'T KNOW WHICHOF THOSE PICTURES WAS SCARIER.
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKINGABOUT? WE ALWAYS NEGOTIATE WITH
TERRORISTS. SAYING WE DON'TNEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
IS OUR OPENING NEGOTIATION PIT.
WE ARE NOT NEGOTIATING WITH YOU,TERRORISTS.
AND YOUR RESPONSE IS.
THAT'S PATHETIC.
THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS SWAPIS A CLICHE.
YOU WOULDN'T CATCH THEADMINISTRATION COUNTERING WITH A
CLICHE.

IN UNIFORM BEHIND.

>> THE UNITED STATES DOES NOTNEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS.
>>YOU NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND.
>> WE DON'T NEGOTIATE WITHTERRORISTS.
>>A GOOD SOLDIER NEVER LEAVES AMAN BEHIND.
>> JON: YOU KNOW, THE ONLYWAY --  THE ONLY WAY TO
REALLY END A CLICHE-OFF IS TOAGREE TO DISAGREE.
