(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY
GUEST TONIGHT THE DIRECTOROF THE HUMAN MICROBIOME
PROGRAM AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITYHIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED
MISSING MICROBES: HOW THEOVERUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS IS
FUELING OUR MODERN PLAGUES.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
MARTIN BLASER, SIR!
(LAUGHTER)
SORRY.
MISSING MICROBES THIS ISSOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HEARD
ABOUT FOR SOME TIME.
BUT THERE'S APPARENTLY AGOOD DEAL OF SCIENCE BEHIND
THE IDEA THAT I SHOULDN'T BETAKING Z-PAKS BECAUSE I'M
TIRED.
WHAT IS THE OVERUSE OFANTI-BIOTICS, WHAT HAS BEEN
HAPPENING?
>> YOU KNOW, ANTI-BIOTICS AREMIRACULOUS.
THEY HAVE SAVED SO MANYLIVES.
BUT WE'VE BEEN USING THEMMORE AND MORE AND MORE.
AND WE HAVE REACHED THEPOINT WHERE MAYBE WE'RE
DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
>> Jon: HOW DO WE KNOW?
BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULTFOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT DOING SOMETHING, YOUSEE THE SAME THING WITH THE
ANTI-VACCINE CROWD.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THATTHEIR BEHAVIOR IS EFFECTING
A MUCH LARGER GROUP BECAUSEIT'S NOT IMMEDIATE AND IT
DOESN'T AFFECT US.
>> WELL, TAKING ANTI-BIOTICSHAS A LOT OF EFFECTS.
ONE OF THEM IS LIKE WITH THEVACCINES, IS THAT IF YOU TAKE
ANTI-BIOTICS IT'S GONNA MAKEALL THE BACTERIA IN THE WORLD
RESISTANT. IT'S GOING TO MAKEIT HARDER FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.
BUT WHAT I AM ESPECIALLYCONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FACT
THAT ANTI-BIOTICS ESPECIALLYFOR YOUNG CHILDREN IS MAKING
THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALLTHESE DISEASES THAT HAVE
BEEN RISING, DIABETES, OBESITYALLERGIES, FOOD
ALLERGIES.
>> Jon: BUT THAT'S THE PART IDON'T UNDERSTAND. SO LET'S
SAY MY DAUGHTER GETS STREPTHROAT.
HAS THE LITTLE SWAB IN HERMOUTH, COMES UP POSITIVE.
YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THATMIGHT NOT ACTUALLY BE A REAL
STREP INFECTION BUT IT JUSTMAY BE THAT THERE IS A
COLONIZATION OF STREP NOTCAUSING THE SYMPTOMS.
>> YEAH. SHE IS-- SHE'S ATLEAST CARRYING STREP. WE KNOW
THAT EVERY WINTER 20% OF THEKIDS ARE CARRYING STREP.
IN THE SUMMER IT GOES DOWNTO 10%.
SO IF YOU RANDOMLY CHECK THETHROAT OF KIDS, 20% OF THEM
ARE GOING TO BE POSITIVE.
SO WE DON'T KNOW A PRIORI IFTHAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING HER
INFECTION.
>> Jon: I WOULD NOT LIKE TOHAVE THE JOB TO RANDOMLY
CHECK KID'S THROATS BECAUSETHAT IS, THAT IS THE THING
IN THE DOCTOR WHERE YOU GO,YOU CAN HOLD HER ARMS AND DO
THIS.
WHEN WE DO THAT, YOU KNOW,YOU MENTION OBESITY,
ALLERGIES, ASTHMA.
TO ME IF THOSE ARE NOTBACTERIAL INFECTIONS, HOW IS
IT THAT USING ANTI-BIOTICSWOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON AN
ALLERGY.
>> BECAUSE, BECAUSE OF THE HUMANMICROBIOME.
BECAUSE MOST OF THE CELLS INOUR BODY ARE BACTERIA.
AND WE'VE HAD IT SINCE WEWERE BORN AND OUR MOTHERS
GAVE ITS TO US AND THEIRMOTHERS.
AND THEY'RE DOING IMPORTANTJOBS FOR US.
>> Jon: NOW YOU WRITE, IT'S10 TO 1, THAT WE ARE
OUTNUMBERED IN OUR OWN BODIES -->> YES.
>> Jon: CELLULARLY 10 TO 1 BYBACTERIA.
>> YEAH. AND THEY'RE HELPING US,TRAINING OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM,
HELPING US DIGEST FOOD -->> Jon: RIGHT.
MAKING VITAMINS FOR US.SO WE NEED THEM.
THEY'RE GOOD FOR US.
AND IF WE KEEP PILING ON WITHTHE ANTI-BIOTICS THAN WE ARE
SUPPRESSING THEM.
AND SOME OF THEM ARE GOINGAWAY, PROBABLY FOR GOOD.
>> Jon: CAN'T WE JUST IN THEWAY THAT YOU TARGET IT --
YOU KNOW, CANCER TREATMENTIS VERY SIMILAR, CHEMO KILLS
EVERYBODY. CANCER CELLS BUT ALSOALL THE HEALTHY CELLS.
ISN'T THERE SOME WAY THATTHE ANTI-BIOTICS CAN BE USED
TO KILL THE STREP BUT THERECAN BE SOME WAY OF
REJUVENATING THE MICROBIOMETHAT THAT WAS DOING ALL
THOSE OTHER JOBS?
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDTO DO.
WE NEED TO MAKE NARROWSPECTRUM ANTI-BIOTICS.
WE HAVE BROAD SPECTRUM THATATTACK EVERYTHING.
BUT WE HAVE THE SCIENCE THATWE COULD DEVELOP NARROW
SPECTRUM ANTI-BIOTICS THATWILL JUST TARGET THE ONE
ORGANISM, MAYBE IT'S STREP,MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT
ORGANISM -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THEN WE NEED THEDIAGNOSTIC SO THAT SOMEBODY
GOING TO A DOCTOR THEY'LL SAYYOU HAVE A VIRUS, YOU HAVE A
BACTERIA.
IF YOU HAVE A BACTERIA,WHICH ONE IS IT.
>> NOW, ISN'T THIS WHERE THEGENOME TYPE PROJECTS WILL GO
ON, BECAUSE FINDING THEGENETIC MAKEUP OF THESE
BACTERIA, WON'T THAT ALLOWUS TO TARGET THESE THINGS
MORE SPECIFICALLY?
>> YEAH, WE HAVE SO MUCHGENOMIC INFORMATION, WE CAN
HARNESS THAT TO MAKE BETTERMEDICINE.
>> Jon: SO, WHY -- OKAY, LET'SDO THAT.
>> YEAH.
SO WE HAVE TO RIGHT NOWANTI-BIOTICS ARE SEEM TO BE VERY
INEXPENSIVE. AND DOCTORSVISITS ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE.
>> Jon: YES.
BUT IF WE'RE NOT DOING THERIGHT THING THEN ULTIMATELY
IT'S GONNA COST US MUCH MORE.
>> WHO WOULD DO THE THINGYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, COME
UP WITH THE TARGETED-- ISTHAT DRUG COMPANIES, IS THAT
IT CAN ONLY ON DONE THROUGHTHE CDC?
LIKE WHO WOULD DO THAT,WOULD YOU DO IT, CAN I ASK
YOU TO DO IT NOW IN FRONT OFUS? WHAT, WHAT --
HOW IS IT THAT WE TAKE THATON?
>> THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDTAXES FOR.
THAT'S OUR TAX DOLLARS, JUSTWHEN WE NEED TAXES TO BUILD A
ROAD THAT EVERYBODY USES.
WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE DRUGSTHAT OUR KIDS AND OUR
GRANDKIDS ARE GOING TO USESO THAT THESE EPIDEMICS CAN
BE STOPPED.
>> Jon: LET'S SAY SO COULDTHERE BE A MANHATTAN PROJECT?
SINCE THAT'S THE CATCHALL FORTHESE TYPES OF, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE GOING TO PUT US ON THEMOON.
SOME WOULD SUGGEST IN TENYEARS IS THAT A REALISTIC
GOAL?
>> I THINK IT IS. I THINK IT IS.
WE NEED BOTH DIAGNOSTICS AND WENEED NARROW SPECTRUM AGENTS.
AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THEECONOMIC BASE OF HOW WE
ASSESS ILLNESS IN KIDS ANDHOW WE TREAT KIDS, HOW WE
PAY DOCTORS SO THAT WEREALLY VALUE THAT MORE.
>> Jon: SEE, WHEN YOU THREW INTHAT LAST PART, THAT MAKES
ME FEEL LIKE OH THAT WILLNEVER GET DONE.
BUT THE SCIENCE PART OF ITFEELS LIKE IT COULD.
BUT THE SYSTEM'S END OF ITFEELS LIKE IT'S IN-- IT'S
MUCH MORE RECALCITRANT THAN THEREST OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
MUCH HARDER TO MOVE.
>> IT IS HARD TO MOVE.
BUT THAT'S WHY I WROTE THEBOOK.
>> Jon: SO THIS BOOK IS --(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)VERY, VERY INTERESTING.
SO YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AND YOU DON'T MINDTHAT I'M STILL GOING TO TAKE
ANTI-BIOTICS AND USE PUREL.
>> OF COURSE THAT'S YOURDECISION.
>> Jon: ALREADY MADE.
MISSING MICROBES IS ON THEBOOK SHELVES NOW,
IT'S FASCINATING STUFF, THANKYOU, SIR.
DOCTOR, NICE TO SEE YOU.
