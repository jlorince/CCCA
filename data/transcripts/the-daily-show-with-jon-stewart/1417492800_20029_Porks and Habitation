(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK. OBVIOUSLY,
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VERY HEAVYAND EMOTIONAL FIRST ACT.
YOU KNOW, BUT BRACE YOURSELVES.
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO THEHEART OF DARKNESS, THAT'S
RIGHT, PIGS.
NO, DON'T LOOK AWAY.
LOOK INTO THE FACE OFHORROR.
LOOK AT IT!
LOOK AT HORROR'S TINYGALOSHES, ALL FOUR OF THEM.
YOU KNOW, LAST MONTH WE TALKEDABOUT A NEW JERSEY STATE BILL
THAT WOULD BAN PIG GESTATIONSCRATES THAT WERE UNBELIEVABLY
SMALL.
THEY COULDN'T MOVE, THEYCOULDN'T TURN TARND.
YEAH, AWW.
WELL, APPARENTLY ONE OF THEINTERESTING QUIRKS OF ANIMALS IS
THAT THEY LIKE TO MOVEAROUND.
THE BILL PASSED THE NEWJERSEY LEGISLATURE EASILY
SO FINALLY I HAVE TO IMAGINE ITIS GOING TO BE A VERY MERRY
CHRISTMAS FOR THE PIGS IN NEWJERSEY.
>> TODAY GOVERNOR CHRISTIEVETOED A CONTROVERSIAL BAN
ON CERTAIN PIG CRATESCALLING THE BILL PARTISAN
POLITICS.
>> WHAT? WHAT THE -- WHAT?
HE VETOED IT?
CONTROVERSIAL BILL, PARTISANPOLITICS?
THE BILL PASSED THE NEW JERSEYSTATE ASSEMBLY 53-13.
THE NEW JERSEY STATE SENATE,32-1.
WHEN DID THE THRESHOLD FORNONPARTISAN BECOME
UNANIMOUS.
THIS BILL WAS FAVORED BY 93%OF NEW JERSIANS.
THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHINGELSE IN THE STATE THAT GETS
THAT KIND OF SUPPORT.
GOING FOR CHEESE STEAKS DOWNTHE SHORE WITH BRUCE
SPRINGSTEIN, ONLY 86%.
TRACK SUITS, TOP-OUT AT 88%.
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IN NEWJERSEY, IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE
COMFORTABLE.
SO UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES ISTHAT BILL PARTISAN OR
CONTROVERSIAL?
>> CHRISTIE HAS GOTTENPRESSURE FROM IOWA'S
GOVERNOR TO NOT SIGNTHE BILL.
>> IOWA, OF COURSE, IS HOME TOTHE FIRST IN THE NATION
PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUSES ANDALSO ABOUT 20 MILLION PIGS.
>> SO THAT IS WHY IT ISCONTROVERSIAL AND
PARTISAN.
YOUR CHOICE WAS EITHERLISTENING TO THE NEARLY
UNANIMOUS VOICE OF THEPEOPLE THAT ELECTED YOU OR
SAYING [BLEEP] THEM, ANDKOWTOWING TO A STATE A
THOUSAND MILES AWAY INEXCHANGE FOR REALLY, LET'S
BE HONEST, THE SLIMMESTCHANCE OF POLITICAL GAIN
IN A CAUCUS YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO WIN.
SIR, SIR, YOU'RE NOT WINNING.
YOU COULD RIDE INTO SIOUX CITYON A TRACTOR MADE OF CORN WHILE
[BLEEP] A "FIELD OF DREAMS" DVD,YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN.
I MEAN HONESTLY.
LET THE PIGS TURN AROUND.
I MEAN THE WAY CHRISTIEDECIDED THIS THING, YOU'D
THINK, YOU'D THINK WE WERE ONTHE PRECIPICE OF PIGS
RUNNING AMOK THROUGHOUTSOCIETY.
A WOMAN WAS BOOTED FROM HERU.S. AIRWAYS PLANE.
>> ESCORTED OFF AFTER HERPIG BECAME DISRUPTIVE.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, I APOLOGIZE,WE SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO
YOU CHRIS CHRISTIE, WILL YOUBE PRESIDENT.
YOU'RE LIKE THE SCIENTIST IN ADISASTER MOVIE THAT NO ONE
BELIEVED UNTIL IT WAS TOOLATE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT PIGS WERERUNNING AROUND ON PLANES.
SO IF I MAY, WHAT'S WITHTHIS MOTHER [BLEEP] PIG ON
THIS MOTHER [BLEEP] PLANE.
>> THE WOMAN STUCK THE 70POUND POTBELLIED PIG IN A
DUFFLE BAG.
SHE CALLS HIM HER EMOTIONALSUPPORT ANIMAL.
>> Jon: LOOK, I GET THAT SOMEPEOPLE NEED EMOTIONAL
SUPPORT ANIMALS, THAT'S FINE.BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE PUTTINGA PIG IN A DUFFLE BAG AND
LAUNCHING IT INTO THE SKY,IF ANYBODY NEEDS EMOTIONAL
SUPPORT IN THAT SITUATION, ITHINK IT'S THE CREATURE THAT
HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE [BLEEP]IS GOING ON.
HE'S IN A BAG.
HIS EARS ARE POPPING.
I THINK YOUR PIG NEEDS HISOWN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PIG.
I THINK-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT, BY THE WAY, THAT SMALLER PIG
APPARENTLY FLIES ALL THETIME, A LITTLE
XANAX, NECK PILLOW, HE'S ALLRIGHT.
ALRIGHT, MAYBE PIGS SHOULDN'TBE FLYING BUT THERE HAS TO BE A
MIDDLE GROUND BETWEENLOCKING PIGS IN TINY CAGES
AND LETTING THEM RUN AMOK ONAIRPLANES.
SOMETHING THAT COMBINESSPACE WITH ECONOMY, MAYBE
THE BACKSEAT OF A FORDFIESTA.
FORD FIESTA, KEEP YOUR PIGIN ONE.
BUT HOW BAD COULD THE PIGEVEN HAVE BEEN?
>> ANOTHER PASSENGER SAIDTHE PIG DIDN'T SMELL SO
GOOD.
AND THEN IT BECAMEINCONTINENT.
>> AS THE OWNER TRIED TOCLEAN UP THE MESS, THE PIG
BEGAN RUNNING BACK ANDFORTH.
>> Jon: YEAH, THIS IS -- THIS ISYOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.
IF YOU LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT YOUWILL SEE THE GRAND CANYON, IF
YOU LOOK TO YOUR LEFT, YOUWILL SEE A SQUEALING PIG
TAKING A PANIC DUMP ON THE DRINKCART.
ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHEN ARE YOUSITTING ON A FLIGHT,
WATCHING A [BLEEP] PIG RUNUP AND DOWN THE AISLE, OR
WATCHING ANY GOVERNOR[BLEEP] ALL OVER A CHANCE TO
DO THE RIGHT THING, THAT'STHE TIME YOU JUST WANT
SOMEONE TO WALK IN AND SAY -->> THAT WILL DO, PIG, THAT
WILL DO.
(LAUGHTER)>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
