>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
OH, WE HAVE A NICE SHOW
TONIGHT.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
ENJOY YOURSELF, OUR GUEST
JASON SUDEIKIS HERE TO PRO
NOTE-- PROMOTE A NEW PROGRAM
HE'S ON SATURDAY,-- ON
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", GOD
BLESS HIM.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS THOUGH
IS GOING TO LAST, EVERYBODY
KNOWS, SATURDAY NIGHT IS
BRIDGE NIGHT.
EVERYBODY THAT WATCHES THE
PROGRAM WE RECENTLY SPENT
TIME ANALYZING HOW SARAH
PALIN HAS BEEN TRAVELING THE
COUNTRY IN A CONSTITUTION
WRAPPED BUS FREQUENTING
EARLY PRIMARY STATES AND
TALKING ABOUT HER PLANS TO
SAVE AMERICA WHICH SUGGESTED
TWO VERY DISTINCT
REQUESTEDS.
>> YOU ARE EITHER RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OR YOU ARE A CRAZY
PERSON.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, LAST NIGHT SARAH PALIN
WENT ON FOX NEWS, BRAVELY
SUPPORTING-- THAT COULD HAVE
EASILY CAR KEYED HER AWAY
IN -- TO PROVIDE THE ANSWER.
>> NO, I'M NOT RUNNING.
>> Jon: SO I'M READY TO CALL
IT WITH 100% OF SARAH
PALIN'S REPORTING TONIGHT.
THE WINNER IS CRAZY PERSON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CRAZY PERSON WAS THE OBVIOUS
FRONT-RUNNER.
ONLY THING NOW IS FOR SARAH
PALIN TO MAKE HER CONCESSION
SPEECH.
BUT UNLIKE CERTAIN ATTENTION
WHORES WHO WILL REMAIN THE
GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY,
SARAH PALIN PLAYED IT IN HER
TYPICAL LOW KEY FASHION.
STATEMENT RELEASED FOR THE
RADIO THEN A FEW HOURS LATER
ON THE PEOPLE.
>> TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I
MADE MY ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY
IN THE FORMAT THAT I DID
BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS 7
1,000,000, NO AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL OF
THAT.
I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, JUST
KIND OF PUT THE MARKER DOWN
AND SAY NO, I'M NOT RUNG.
NOT HAVE A BIG PRESS
CONFERENCE, NOT MAKE A BIG
DARN DEAL ABOUT IT, BECAUSE
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.
ALTHOUGH TRUTH BE TOLD YOU
CAN'T SPELL AMERICA WITHOUT--
(LAUGHTER)
OR IF I MAY ASK YOU GOVERNOR
PALIN, THAN WHAT WERE YOU
DOING.
>> SARAH PALIN HAS STARTED
THE NATIONWIDE BUS TOUR.
>> SHE CASHED MITT ROMNEY'S
PARTY BRINGING HER BUS TOUR
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE ON THE SAME
DAY THE FORMER MASSACHUSETTS
GOVERNOR WAS THERE TO
ANNOUNCE FOR PRESIDENT.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKES HIS
FIRST 2011 VISIT IN IOWA,
AND AT THE SAME TIME SARAH
PALIN MAKES AN APPEARANCE.
>> SARAH PALIN WASN'T IN THE
BIG DEBATE AND SHE IS NOT ON
SATURDAY'S IOWA EXTRAPOLL
BALLOT BUT ROLLED INTO THE
STATE FAIR.
>> THE TOUR IS REALLY
STEALING THE POLITICAL
CENTER FROM SO OTHER
PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES
WITHIN THE WORST PART ISN'T
SHE IS LIKE A GUEST AT A
WEDDING THAT SHOWS UP
WEARING A WEDDING DRESS BUT
INSISTS, HEY, I AM NOT HERE
SPOILING YOUR BIG DAY, I'M
JUST HERE TO HELP YOU GET
YOUR MESSAGE OUT ABOUT
FIDDLITY.
(LAUGHTER)
OH, AND IF YOU DON'T MIND, I
HAVE SOME VOWS I WANT TO
READ, IT WON'T TAKE A
MINUTE.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
THAT-- FOR THE MOST PART HER
NARCISSISM IS VICTIMLESS
CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THIS.
>> TWO WEEKS AGO PALIN
SUPPORTERS GOT A LETTER FROM
SARAHPAC CURIOUSLY SPECIFIC
ABOUT ITS PURPOSE.
AS YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR PALIN
IS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING
HER DECISION OF WHETHER OR
NOT TO RUN FOR OFFICE.
SOMEONE MUST SAVE OUR NATION
FROM THE ROAD TO EUROPEAN
SOCIAL ILL, DO YOU THINK IT
SHOULD BE GOFF TER PALIN.
IF SO, CAN YOU SEND YOUR
BEST ONE TIME GIFT TO
SARAHPAC AND SHOW HER WE
SUPPORT HER IF SHE DECIDES
TO RUN.
SO EVERYONE, LET ME
TRANSLATE THAT, IF YOU WANT
TINKER BELL TO LIVE, CLAP
HARRER.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW SARAHPAC ISN'T JUST SOME
GRASS ROOTS PALIN FAN CLUB
THAT SPROUTED UP NATURALLY
OUT OF THE MANURE FIELDS OF
WASILLA.
IT'S SARAH PALIN'S PAC AND
BY PAC I MEAN PACK OF MONEY.
IT'S HER MONEY, SHE CONTROLS
IT, SHE ALREADY USED
PREVIOUS DONATIONS FOR HER
FAMILY VACATION NECESSITIES
LIKE THE 14,000 DOLLAR
CONSTITUTION BUS ART,
$10,000 ON LOGISTICAL TRIP
CONSULTING.
$7,000 ON LODGING AND $3200
THAT WANT TO HER PARENTS,
CHUCK AND SALLIE HEATH FOR
PURPOSE OF DISBURSEMENT
CORRESPONDENCE AND CARD
MAILING.
NOW YOU MAY SAY TO YOURSELF,
WOW, THAT IS [BLEEP] CRAZY.
BUT THOSE ARE THE RULES THAT
ARE SET UP.
THE ONLY WAY THAT THE LITTLE
SCHEME WOULD BE DISHONORABLE
OR SHADY IS IF PALIN HAD
KNOWN ALL ALONG WHAT HER
DECISION WAS YET CONTINUED
TO DANGLE HER INDECISION AS
A LURE.
TO UNSUSPECTING DONORS.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROVE
THAT.
YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE CLOSE TO THE
OPERATION BUT PERHAPS TOO
NAIVE TO REALIZE SHE HAS
INADVERTENTLY SPILLED THE
BEANS ON LET'S SAY JUNE
28th.
>> DO YOU GET THE SENSE THAT
YOUR MOM HAS NOT MADE UP HER
MIND OR DO YOU THINK SHE
KNOWS AND HASN'T TOLD US.
>> YOU KNOW, SHE DEFINITELY
KNOWS.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE,
BUT SOME THINGS JUST NEED TO
STAY IN THE FAMILY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SEE, THAT KIND OF
TAKES THE OUT OF THE
SELF-LESS CATEGORY AND PUTS
