AUDIENCE BIG FANS OF THE
PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.
REMEMBER WHEN SARAH PALIN
TOOK THAT EAST COAST
CONSTITUTION BUS TOUR
MEETING HONEST, HARDWORKING
AMERICANS AND DONALD TRUMP?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
WELL ARC PARENTLY SHE WAS
TRAVELING WITH A PRO BECAUSE
PALIN AND HER POLITICAL
ACTION COMMITTEE HAVE TURNED
AROUND IN JUST ONE WEEK THE
MOST OVERPRODUCED VACATION I
IMOVIE OF ALL TIME.
>> THIS WEEK OF TOURING HAS
BEEN ONE OF THE BEST WEEKS
OF MY LIFE.
>> SARAH PALIN ROLLED INTO
THE BELLY OF THE BEAST.
MAMA GRIZZLY IN WASHINGTON.
>> WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING WHAT
IT IS THAT BUILT AMERICA,
OUR STRONG FOUNDATION.
EVEN THE BUS HAS GOT THE
WORDS FROM THE PREAMBLE OF
THE CONSTITUTION, WE THE
PEOPLE ON IT.
SO THAT WE CAN TELL THE REST
OF AMERICA HOW IMPORTANT IT
IS THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR
FOUNDATION IS ALL ABOUT.
>> HOPEFULLY I CAN INSPIRE
OTHERS IN ORDER TO AFFECT
POSITIVE CHANGE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THESE'S-- SHE'S NOT
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, SHE'S
RUNNING FOR RUSH MORE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE VIDEO PEERS TO DETAIL
HOW THE HALF TERM ALASKAN
GOVERNOR FIRST IMMIGRATED TO
THIS GREAT NATION, BEFORE
SHE SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION,
SHE RANG THE LIBERTY BELL
AND THEN SHE KILLED A MAN AT
ALTAMONT.
ALL WHILE ONE COLDPLAY SOUND
ALIKE SONG PLAYS.
HOW PROPAGANDAI WAS IT, THEY
FOUND SOUND BITES FROM LAME
STREAM MEDIA REPORTERS WHILE
SMOOTHLY EDITING OUT SIGN OF
THEIR BEWILDERMENT OR
CONTEMPT.
>> AS THE TOUR ROLLS ON.
>> STOPPING AT HIS HISTORIC
PLACES LIKE GETTYSBURG.
>> AND PHILADELPHIA TO SEE
THE LIBERTY BELL.
>> TODAY TO ELLIS ISLAND IN
NEW YORK.
>> AND THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY.
>> I GUARANTEE YOU THERE IS
AN EDITING ROOM FLOOR
LITTERED WITH PHRASES LIKE
FOR SOME REASON.
AND "WHY?
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS COOL, MAN?
THE WAY THEY HAVE REPORTERS
FINISHING EACH OTHER'S
SENTENCES.
WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT
TECHNIQUE BEFORE.
>> I HAVE GENITAL HERPES.
AND I TRIED TO BE CAREFUL.
>> VERY CAREFUL.
>> VERY CAREFUL.
>> NOW I TAKE ONCE DAILY
VALTREX TO REDUCE MY RISK OF
PASSING IT ON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE OLD FINISHING
EACH OTHER'SS HERPES
COMMERCIAL TECHNIQUE.
WELL-- THEY BOTH
