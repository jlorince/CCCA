ATM.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
SO CARRY ON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT EVERY UPDATE IN THIS SEGMENT INVOLVES CRIME AND GREED.
THERE'S ALSO ARROGANCE AND GENERAL DOWCH -- DOUCHEERY.
I GIVE YOU AIG.
THE COMPANY WE BAILED OUT.
THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A MESSAGE FOR AMERICA AND CONTRARY TO COMMERCIALS IT'S NOT THANK YOU.
>> THERE ARE SOME AIG SHAREHOLDERS BRING A $25 BILLION SUIT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THE TERMS OF BAILOUT WERE TOO ONEROUS.
>> Jon: SUING THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE YOU $182 BILLION AND SAVED YOUR COMPANY.
I CAN ONLY ASSUME BECAUSE THAT ACT FILLED YOUR HEARTS AT AIG WITH GRATITUDE AND THEN YOUR
IMMUNE SYSTEM THEN ATTACKED THAT AS A FOREIGN SUB STANCE BECAUSE LIKE NATIVE AMERICANS WITH SMALL
POX YOU HAD NO PREVIOUS EXPOSURE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO IS THE GREEDY MOTHER (bleep) BEHIND THIS LAWSUIT PLEASE DON'T BE A JEW.
PLEASE DON'T BE A JEW.
>> THE MAN WHO FILED THE LAWSUIT IS FORMER AIG C.E.O. HANK GREENBERG.
>> Jon: NOO!
HANK GREENBERG!
ALL RIGHT NOT NECESSARILY JEWISH.
HE COULD HAVE CHANGED HIS NAME FROM STUART.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BY THE WAY, I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN CLOSER TO SAYING THE WORDS RELEASE THE HOUNDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
INTERESTING SIDE NOTE, MAURICE HANK GREENBERG IS NOT ONLY SUING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR SO
RUDELY SAVING HIS COMPANY, HE IS ALSO ATTACKING THEM IN A NEW BOOK SET TO BE PUNISHED JANUARY 29.
IT'S THE EXACT SAME DAY THAT I'M RELEASING MY BOOK WHICH IS IS CALLED "DON'T BUY MAURICE
GREENBERG'S (bleep) BOOK." IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE BOOK THIS YEAR ABOUT THE STUPIDITY OF A
BOOK MAKE IT" DON'T BUY MAURICE GREENBERG'S (bleep) BOOK."
>> IT'S A LUDICROUS ARGUMENT.
>> TALK ABOUT THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU.
>> THEY HAD A CHOICE.
THEY COULD HAVE GONE BANKRUPT THEY TOOK OUR CASH.
>> I WAS STUNNED ABOUT.
THIS I THINK IT'S CRAZY.
>> Jon: LET'S REIN IT IN HERE.
WHAT AIG SHAREHOLDERS ARE DOING IS OBJECTIVELY ALL OF, BUT SHOCK, SURPRISING?
AIG, THEY PUT THE A IN (bleep).
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER WE GAVE THEM THE BAILOUT MONEY IN 2008?
>> ONLY DAYS AFTER TAXPAYERS PROVIDED $85 BILLION TO BAILOUT AIG, COMPANY EXECUTIVES CAME
HERE FOR A WEEK-LONG RETREAT, WINING, DINING AND GOLF.
>> Jon: IF ANYTHING THE ONLY THING AIG IS GUILTY OF IS CONSISTENCY, THAT AND A SERIES
OF CATASTROPHIC INVESTMENTS THAT BROUGHT THE WORLD TO THE BRINK OF ARMAGEDDON BUT THAT WAS
PRETTY CONSISTENT.
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THE LAWSUIT IS BASED ON.
>> THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THE TERMS OF BAILOUT INCLUDING THE HIGH INTEREST RATE IT HAD TO PAY WERE
UNFAIR TO SHAREHOLDERS.
THIS SATE TERMS DEPRIVED SHAREHOLDERS OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
>> Jon: GUY WHO USED TO RUN AIG IS MAD BECAUSE WHEN HIS COMPANY WAS HIT BY A CALAMITY
THEY CLEARLY WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THEM THE GROUP THAT STEPPED IN TO PROVIDE FUNDS THIS THEY
NEED ASSESSED THE COMPANY AND THOUGHT THEY HAD A PREEXISTING CONDITION CALLED THE MONEY IS
ALL GONE REA SO THEY CHARGED THEM A HIGHER RATE ALMOST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPANY,
PROFITING FROM THEIR MISFORTUNE IF YOU WILL CSM DID THAT UPSET YOU, AIG,?
IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
SUE ME?
NO, NO SUE YOU.
