>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
YES, WE'RE BACK, BABY, SO NICE
TO SEE YOU.
I HOPE YOU HAD A NICE NEW
YEAR'S.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE NO LONGER
ROUND MOUND OF REBOUND, SIR
CHARLES BARKLEY.
I SAW HIM BACKSTAGE, HE LOOKS
UNBELIEVABLE.
(APPLAUSE)
HE LOOKS UNBELIEVABLE.
I WANT TO START BY SAYING
CHARLES BARKLEY'S NEW YEAR'S
RESOLUTION SHOULD BE TO LET
HIMSELF GO BECAUSE HE LOOKS
TREMENDOUS.
OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THAT TONIGHT
YOU'RE EXCITED TO HEAR THE
RESULTS OF TODAY'S IOWA CAUCUS.
I DO NOT KNOW THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I AM BROADCASTING TO YOU
FROM THE PAST.
(LAUGHTER)
IN MY WORLD, IT IS 6:00 P.M.,
JANUARY 3.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I DO
KNOW.
THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE
AND THE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS'
DESPERATE EFFORT TO EXPLORE
EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE OPTION--
LIVING OR OTHERWISE-- BEFORE
ULTIMATELY AND UNHAPPILY VOTING
FOR MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
THE RITE OF PASSAGE FOR
REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOWN AS
ROMSPRINGA.
(LAUGHTER)
YES, REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOW
THEY'RE GOING TO END UP WITH
ROMNEY MUCH IN THE WAY A
16-YEAR-OLD AMISH BOY KNOWS HIS
SIX MONTHS WITH AN IPOD WILL
ULTIMATELY GIVE WAY TO SEVERAL
DECADES OF HAND-TOOLED BARN
BUILDING.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, WHEN OUR SHOW LEFT IN
DECEMBER.
NEWT GINGRICH WAS REPUBLICANS'
TEMPORARY VICE.
WHICH ENDED MUCH IN THE WAY THE
YOUNG AMISH'S FIRST ENCOUNTER
WITH ALCOHOL ENDS-- NAUSEA,
VOMITING AND A VOW TO THE LORD
NEVER TO GO NEAR THAT (BLEEP)
AGAIN.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
WHICH BRING US TO RON PAUL.
RON PAUL.
COULD HE-- THE PRODRUG
LEGALIZATION ANTIWAR
OBSTETRICIAN BE THE BRIEF
REPUBLICAN FLIRTATION THAT COULD
LEAD THE FLOCK ASTRAY?
>> RON PAUL HAS DISAVOWED
NEWSLETTERS WITH HIS NAME ON
THEM.
NEWSLETTERS FROM THE 1980s AND
'90s WITH RACIAL INSULTS
TOWARD AFRICAN AMERICANS AND
OTHERS.
>> Jon: OKAY, PROBABLY NOT.
THE NEWSLETTER!
DID YOU PEOPLE KNOW THAT BEFORE
YOU COULD WRITE CRAZY (BLEEP) ON
TUMBLER AND WORD PRESS PEOPLE
HAD TO TYPE THEIR CRAZY (BLEEP)
UP AND PRINT IT OUT ON WHAT WAS
CALLED PAPER.
(LAUGHTER)
AND DISTRIBUTED BY HAND REACHING
ONLY TO A FEW PARANOID SPIR
CYSTS WHO LIVED WITHIN WALKING
DISTANCE OF YOUR... I GUESS WHAT
YOU WOULD CALL LAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, SO THE FUSE LETTER IS
NOT GOOD.
I WOULD PREFER RON PAUL DO A
BETTER JOB OF OWNING THIS
TERRIBLE MISTAKE WITH THESE
NEWSLETTERS.
HERE'S WHY THE DOCTOR STILL HAS
FANS: HIS OPPONENTS, HOW WILL
THEY ATTACK PAUL OVER THESE
NEWSLETTERS?
>> I TOOK IT TO RON PAUL OVER
THE ISSUE OF A NUCLEAR IRAN.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR A
CANDIDATE WHO WOULD ALLOW IRAN
TO BE ARMED AND TO WIPE OUT
ISRAEL.
>> ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE PEOPLE
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THINKS
IT'S OKAY FOR IRAN TO HAVE A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
I DON'T.
>> Jon: THEIR MAIN PROBLEM
WITH RON PAUL ISN'T THE RACIST
CONSPIRACY MONGERING NEWSLETTER,
IT'S BECAUSE HE WON'T PRE-AGREE
TO START A WAR WITH IRAN.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S LIKE HATING THE T.V. SHOW
"WORK IT" BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A
HALF HOUR
