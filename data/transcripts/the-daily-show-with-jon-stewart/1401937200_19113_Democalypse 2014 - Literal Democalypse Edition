>> JON: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT. WE HAVE PREPARED A
PROGRAM MY GUEST TONIGHT,EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST
AND ACTIVIST GIGI IBRAHIMWILL BE HERE.
WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUTTHE SITUATION IN EGYPT.
AS YOU KNOW, THEY RECENTLYHAD AN ELECTION THERE
WHERE EGYPTIANS TOOK TO THEPOLLS TO USHER IN A NEW ERA OF
DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL CHANGE.
THEY SWEPT OUT THE MILITARY COUPCOMMANDANT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI
THEY SWEPT OUT THE MILITARY COUPCOMMANDANT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI
AND REPLACED HIM WITHDEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI. WELL,THAT'S WEIRD. THE STRONG MAN
THEY'RE THROWING OUT OF OFFICEHAS THE SAME NAME AND FACE
AS THE NEW PRESIDENT. PERHAPSTHAT WILL BE MY FIRST QUESTION
TO GIGI. OF COURSE, EGYPT RIGHTNOW IS JUST A NUBILE, YOUNG
DEMOCRACY MERELY TOYINGWITH THE LEVERS OF SELF
DETERMINATION TO ENJOY THESOPHISTICATED AND MATURE BOUQUET
OF REPRESENTATION YOU MUSTTURN TO THESE UNITED STATES
WHERE, FOR INSTANCEIN LAST NIGHT'S IOWA REPUBLICAN
SENATE RACE OUR HIGH MINDEDRHETORIC WAS SECOND TO NONE.
>> I'M JONI ERNST.
I GREW UP CASTRATING HOGS ON ANIOWA FARM.
>> JON: AS OUR FOUNDINGFATHERS INTEDED IT TO BE.
BY THE WAY, SHE WON THE PRIMARY.I BELIEVE THE LOSERS OPENING
STATEMENT WAS I USE TO FART INTOMY HAND AND THEN SMELL IT.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
ALRIGHT. MAYBE WEDON'T HAVE AS A MATURE DEMOCRACY
AS WE WOULD LIKE. DOES ANYONEOUT THERE GOT A
DEMOCRACY THAT'S REALLY,TRULY BLOOMING?
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 50YEARS SYRIANS HAVE A CHOICE
AMONG CANDIDATES IN APRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TODAY.
>> JON: NOW WE'RE GETTINGSOMEWHERE.
SYRIA. YES, AS IT TURNSOUT THE EPICENTER OF ONE OF THE
WORLD'S HARSHEST AND BLOODIESTCIVIL WARS IS NOW A MUST VISIT
FOR DEMOCRACY CONNOISSEURS.IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S
DEMOCALYPSE 2014: LITERALDEMOCALPYSE EDITION.
SO, WHAT ARE THE HALLMARKS OFSYRIAN DEMOCRACY?
>> VOTING IS RESTRICTED TO AREASCONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
>> JON: SAME HERE:SCHOOLS, GYMNASIUMS AND SUCH.
>> THE SYMBOLIC WAYTO DECLARE
ALLEGIANCE IS TO CAST THEIRBALLOT IN BLOOD.
>> JON: THAT'S DIFFERENT.
ALTHOUGH DO SYRIANS GET AN IVOTED STICKER? SO, I GUESS YOU
GET TEN ELECTIONS IN SYRIA ANDYOU'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE VOTING.
WHAT TYPE OF CAMPAIGNSIGNAGE MAY REPRESENT THE SYRIAN
ELECTION SEASON.
>> PERHAPS THE MOSTCONTROVERSIAL ELECTION POSTER IN
THE WORLD. BASHAR AL-ASSADON A BURNT OUT BUILDING IN THE
BATTLE SCARRED TOWN OF HOMS.
>> JON: OK, THAT SEEMSTONE DEAF. BUT MAKES SENSE
IF YOU KNOW ASSAD'S SLOGAN. I'MSOMEWHAT HESITANT TO COMPARE
WITH MY PARALLEL DEMOCRACYSTUDY. OUT OF CURIOSITY,
THE INCUMBENT BASHARAL-ASSAD, WHAT'S HIS STANCE ON
I DON'T KNOW, GREEN HOUSE GASES?
>> THE REGIME HAS HUNDREDSOF TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND LARGE
STOCK PILES OF SARIN.
>> ATTACKING HIS OWN PEOPLE WITHCHLORINE GAS.
>> JON: OKAY.
I WILL PUT YOU DOWN ASREGULATION AVERSE.
LOOK, I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT ACAMPAIGN ADVISOR OR POLITICAL
STRATEGIST IN ANY WAY, BUTI THINK THIS CANDIDATE
AL-ASSAD IS VULNERABLE ON ANUMBER OF SPOT HERE.
WHAT DOES HIS OPPONENTHASSAN AL NOURI HAVE TO SAY?
BECAUSE UNLESS THIS GUY'S ATOTAL TOOL, I THINK HE'S GOING
TO CRUSH AL-ASSAD.
>> HASSAN AL NOURI CALLEDAL-ASSAD A VERY STRONG LEADER
AND HE SAID QUOTE YOU HAVE TORESPECT WHAT ASSAD IS DOING.
>> POLITICALLY I THINK HE ISDOING WHAT HE HAS TO DO,
ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THECRISIS.
>> I DO AGREE WITH PRESIDENTASSAD IN MANY ISSUES.
>> I'M NOT ANTI-ASSAD.
AND NO ONE IS PERFECT.
>> JON: IN FACT I AM VOTING FORHIM.
