SCHEDULE."
ANYWAY CONGRESSMAN PAUL, OF
COURSE, TURNING IN ANOTHER
FINE PERFORMANCE LAST THURSDAY
WHEN THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
GATHERED IN FLORIDA FOR THE
FOX NEWS GOOGLE DEBATE.
THE 83rd SUCH DEBATE SO FAR
THIS YEAR FOLLOWING OF COURSE
THE PREVIOUS CNN TEA PARTY
DEBATE, THE REAGAN LIBRARY
DEBATE, THE HISTORY CHANNEL
CIVIL WAR RECREATIONIST DEBATE,
THE TRON DEBATE.
THE "ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE
DARK" DEBATE, AND THE "DON'T
TELL RICK SANTORUM WE'RE
CANCELING THE DEBATE" DEBATE.
BY THE WAY, SANTORUM...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
SANTORUM STILL CAME IN FIFTH
IN THAT DEBATE.
THINGS AREN'T GOING HIS WAY.
SO WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY LEARN
ABOUT THE CANDIDATES DURING
THEIR THIRD DEBATE IN 15 DAYS?
PROBABLY NOTHING.
BUT THE AUDIENCE CONTINUES TO
SURPRISE.
>> IN 2010 WHEN I WAS DEPLOYED
TO IRAQ I HAD TO LIE ABOUT WHO
I WAS BECAUSE I'M A GAY
SOLDIER.
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB.
MY QUESTION IS, UNDER ONE OF
YOUR PRESIDENCIES, DO YOU
INTEND TO CIRCUMVENT THE
PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE FOR
GAY AND LESBIAN SOLDIERS IN
THE MILITARY?
>> (AUDIENCE: (BOOING).
>> Jon: YEAH, BOO.
I GIVE THE AUDIENCE CREDIT.
IT TAKES A LOT OF BALLS TO BOO
A GUY WHO CAN STICK YOUR HEAD
IN HIS BICEPS AND CRACK IT
LIKE A WALNUT.
LOOK AT THOSE THINGS.
THOSE AREN'T BICPEPS.
IF I'M SURE IF THIS GUY TURNED
INTO THE HULK, HIS ARMS WOULD
STAY THE SAME SIZE.
THEY WOULD JUST TURN GREEN.
BUT OF COURSE RICK SANTORUM
HANDLED THIS UGLY INCIDENT
BEAUTIFULLY.
NO, HE DID NOT CHASTISE ANY
INDIVIDUALS IN THE CROWD FOR
THEIR DISGRACEFUL OUTBURSTS,
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE DON'T ASK
DON'T TELL.
>> THAT POLICY WOULD BE
REINSTITUTED.
AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN, I
WOULD NOT THROW THEM OUT
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR
TO THEM BECAUSE OF THE POLICY
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.
BUT WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD IN
CONFORMITY WITH WHAT WAS
HAPPENING IN THE PAST WHICH
WAS SEX IS NOT AN ISSUE.
IT SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.
LEAVE IT ALONE.
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.
WHETHER YOU'RE HETEROSEXUAL OR
HOMOSEXUAL.
>> Jon: WHAT PLANET DO YOU
(BEEP) LIVE ON?
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HONESTLY.
WHAT PLANET?
THAT SEX IS NOT AN ISSUE?
YES, THE ARMY HAS NEVER
MENTIONED SPOUSES HETEROSEXUAL
OR HOMOSEXUAL.
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO AN ARMY
WHERE SOLDIERS NEVER SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
LIKE THIS CHANT: I DON'T KNOW
KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD ESKIMO
GENITALIA ARE MIGHTY COLD.
THE CLASSIC AIRCRAFT, THE
MEMPHIS PAT.
AND THE PLANE THAT DROPPED THE
ATOMIC BOMB, THE ENOLA "NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS."
THE GUY IS AN I
