WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM
AS AUDIENCES FOR NEWS SHOWS AGE,AND LET'S FACE FACTS, DIE,
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TOSTAY CONNECTED WITH THE YOUTH
DEMOGRAPHIC. WE AT "THE DAILYSHOW' HAVE HIRED OUR OWN
YOUTH CORRESPONDENT -- A"YOUTH-SPERT," IF YOU WILL
TO HELP US KEEP CONNECTED TO,FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND,
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO BUYTHINGS.
PLEASE WELCOME OUR"TRENDSPOTTER," DEMETRI MARTIN.
WE ALL KNOW THE YOUTHDEMOGRAPHIC IS THE COOLEST
ONE TO HAVE. CIGARETTE COMPANIESWERE THE FIRST TO IDENTIFY
THIS LUCRATIVE MARKET,ADVERTISING WITH CHILD-FRIENDLY
CHARACTERS LIKE JOE CAMEL, THEKOOL PENGUIN AND...
WELL ACTUALLY THOSE ARE TWO GOODEXAMPLES RIGHT THERE.
BIG TOBACCO RAKED IN HUGEPROFITS THANKS TO THOSE MASCOTS
AND THE FACT THAT NICOTINE ISREEEEALLY ADDICTIVE.
BEER COMPANIES WENT ONE STEPFURTHER: GENETRICALLY
ENGINEERED TALKING MASCOTS.
"BUD-WEI-SER."
THAT'S SO EFFECTIVE. BUT NOWIT'S WINE'S TURN.
INTEREST HAS PEAKED SINCE LASTYEAR'S HIT FILM SIDEWAYS,
A MOVIE ABOUT A KIND OF CHUBBYGUY WHO DRINKS WINE...
AND WITH RECENT TRENDS LIKECOLD WEATHER AND WAR,
THE INDUSTRY WANTS YOUNG PEOPLETO TURN TO WINE TO NUMB THEIR
PAIN. ONE MORNING DURINGBREAKFAST I WENT TO ONE OF NEW
YORK CITY'S TRENDIEST WINE SHOPSTO FIND OUT HOW THEY'RE GETTING
KIDS TO DRINK MORE WINE.
LG: WINE IS BEING MARKETED TOYOUNG PEPLE BY FRESH EXCITING
LABELS, ARTISTIC LABELS, UM,TETRA PACKS, SCREW TOPS.
UM, THE WINE COMPANIES REALIZETHERE'S A MARKET THERE.
DM: DO YOU THINK WINE MAKES APERSON PEE AS MUCH AS
BEER DOES?LG: NO.
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING.
MY STATISTICS SHOW IN THE LAST 6MONTHS, 98% OF ALL AMERICANS
UNDER THE AGE OF 25 HAVE HAD ATLEAST TWO GLASSES OF WINE
EVERY DAY.
WHILE THAT STATISTIC IS BASED ONA GUESS, IT'S PROBABLY TRUE.
BUT WHY IS WINE SO POPULAR WHENEVERONE KNOWS MERLOT
IS FOR PUSSIES?
LG: WE HAVE A WINE IN THE SHOPCALLED GNARLY HEAD. OBVIOUSLY
THE NAME IS GEARED TOWARDS AYOUNGER CROWD.
WITH OTHER BRANDS CALLED "JAKE'SFAULT" AND "RAZOR'S EDGE,"
THE NAMES SOUND LESS LIKE WINEAND MORE LIKE THE LINEUP AT
A SUBURBAN JAM BAND FEST.
I WOULD TOTALLY DRINK THOSEBANDS. BUT IS THE SWEET-ASS
LABEL AND A 14% ALCOHOL CONTENTENOUGH TO PERSUADE KIDS?
LD: VIRAL MARKETING IS WHERELEQUOR COMPANIES SEND
INDIVIDUALS THAT WORK FOR THEMINTO BARS AND UM TO PROMOTE
THEIR BRAND.
LATE ONE AFTERNOON I HEADED TOMIDTOWN TO ONE OF NEW YORK
CITY'S TRENDIEST BARS. I WANTEDTO HANG WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE
AND FEEL THIS TREND FIRST HAND.
YOU GUYS MIND IF I HANG OUT?
SURE. COME ON IN.
COOL COOL I JUST BROUGHT SOMESTUFF. IM KINDA JUST LIKE
YOU GUYS, IM JUST LIKE HANGINGOUT YOU KNOW. CHILLING.
WE'RE CHILLIN. SOMETIMES IDON'T EVEN SAY THE G EVEN AT
THE END.
BUT IT'S FUNNY IVE BEEN DRINKINGWINE LATELY I DON'T KNOW
IT'S JUST, THE NAME'S AWESOMETOO. IT'S "RAZOR'S EDGE."
WHICH IS KINDA COOL IT'S SHARP,YEAH.
IT'S PRETTY RAD.
YEAH IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL LIKEI'M MAKING MOVES LIKE CUTTING
STUFF UP, YOU KNOW.
WHILE NOT EVERYONE BOUGHT THISSALES PITCH, I DID GET THE GIRL
TO CHUG SOME WINE.
NOT BAD, EY?
DELICIOUS.
BUT I NEEDED A LITTLE MORE HELPTO CLOSE THE DEAL.
CAN WE GET, CAN I GET A LONGISLAND ICE TEA, MAYBE,
AND A KAMIKAZE?
PRETTY SWEET NIGHT, JON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THATREPORT DEMETRI. NOW UH,
IT'S HARD FOR US AS OLDER PEOPLETO SEE THE YOUTH TRENDS BUT
IS THERE ANY THINGS THAT OURVIEWERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF
THAT CAN HELP THEM STAY ON TOPOF THIS HOT NEW TREND?
OH YEAH ABSOLUTELY JON, HERE ARESOME TREND TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND
WHILE ENJOYING YOUR WINE,ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
A YOUNG PERSON. IF YOU'RE EATINGPASTA, CHOOSE WHITE WINE.
IF YOU'RE EATING MEAT, RED WINE.AND IF YOU'RE VEGAN,
YOU'RE ANNOYING.
OH, DON'T BE FOOLED BY "WINECOOLERS"
EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'SCOOLER, IT'S JUST GAY WINE.
