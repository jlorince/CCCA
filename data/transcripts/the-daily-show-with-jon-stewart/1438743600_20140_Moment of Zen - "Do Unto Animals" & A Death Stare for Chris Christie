>> Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW.
BEFORE WE GO, I WANT TO TELL YOUSOMETHING.
ONE OF THE GREAT PLEASURES OFTHIS SHOW IS HAVING A PULPIT TO
INTRODUCE AN AUDIENCE TO BOOKS ICARE ABOUT, BOOKS I LOVE.
I'M GOING TO MISS THAT.
BEFORE I GO, I'M GOING TO DO ITONE MORE TIME.
I HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK, THISINCREDIBLE YOUNG AUTHOR, HER
NAME IS MY WIFE.
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY, MY WIFE, SHE ACTUALLYWROTE THIS BOOK, IT'S CALLED "DO
UNTO ANIMALS."
IT'S INCREDIBLE ILLUSTRATIONS,BY THIS WOMAN LISEL ASHLOCK.
IT'S ABOUT MY WIFE'S JOURNEYIN FINDING HER PASSION TO WORK
WITH ANIMALS, ABOUT HOW YOU CANIMPROVE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE ANIMALS IN YOUR HOUSE AND INYOUR YARD.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN -- LISTEN, I'MSO PROUD, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT
MY WIFE IS A KINDER AND NICERPERSON THAN I AM.
BUT TO KNOW THAT SHE IS FUNNIERAND A BETTER WRITER?
(LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YA,STINGS A LITTLE BIT.
BUT THE BOOK IS CALLED "DO UNTOANIMALS."
IT'S NOT OUT RIGHT NOW, BUT WHENIT COMES OUT, I'M NOT GOING TO
HAVE A SHOW, AND HOLDING IT UPAT HOME, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
DOESN'T DO (BLEEP).
SO YOU CAN PRE-ORDER IT OR,BETTER YET, MAYBE HEAD DOWN TO
YOUR LOCAL BOOK STORE, MAYBEYOUR INDEPENDENT BOOK STORE, ASK
THEM TO ORDER IT FOR YOU.
IT'S A REMARKABLE, HEARTFELT,FUNNY.
JANE GOODALL SAYS NICE THINGSABOUT IT!
SO I HOPE YOU DO THAT.
ALL THE PROCEEDS GO TO FARMSANCTUARY, WHICH IS A WONDERFUL
ORGANIZATION THAT RESCUES FARMANIMALS AND GIVE THEM THE TYPE
OF LIFE THESE INDIVIDUALSDESERVE.
SO "DO UNTO ANIMALS," GET YOURCOPY NOW.
HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
>> DONALD HAS LOTS OF SKILLSAND TALENTS THAT MADE HIM AND
MEME AROUND HIM WEALTHY.
THAT'S A GREAT THING.
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAMESKILLS TRANSFERABLE TO
GOVERNING.
SO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOWYOU HAVE TO WORK WITH OTHER
PEOPLE.
