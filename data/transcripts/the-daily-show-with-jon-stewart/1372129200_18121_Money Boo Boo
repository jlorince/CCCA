COMEDY CENTRAL
>> John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
I AM JOHN OLIVER.
STILL HERE FOR JON STEWART WHO
IS CURRENTLY IN MOSCOW OR
ECUADOR OR ON A FLIGHT SOMEWHERE
OR ESCAPED FROM THE NATIONAL
ZOO.
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ACTRESS MAGGIE
GYLLENHAAL IS HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT FIRST, BUT FIRST TONIGHT,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY!
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FIVE YEARS
AGO WHEN BANKS NEARLY DESTROYED
THE WORLD.
DO YOU REMEMBER THINKING, I
COULDN'T GET ANY MORE PISSED OFF
AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAN I
AM RIGHT NOW.
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
[BLEEP].
>> BOMBSHELL EMAILS REPORTEDLY
SHOW HOW TWO BIG CREDIT RATING
AGENCIES ACCEPTED CASH IN
EXCHANGE FOR GREEN-LIGHTING THE
RISKY PRACTICES THAT GOT US INTO
THIS LONG MESS.
ONE S&P OFFICIAL REPORTEDLY
EMAILED, "LET'S HOPE WE ARE ALL
WEALTHY AND RETIRED BY THE TIME
THIS HOUSE OF CARDS FAULTERS."
AND ANOTHER QUOTE, "LORD HELP
OUR EXPLETIVE SCAM.
THIS HAS TO BE THE STUPIDEST
PLACE I HAVE WORKED AT."
>> John: BY THE WAY JUST
INCIDENTALLY I'M GUESSING THAT'S
NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE
SMITH HAS HAD TO SAY, "THIS HAS
TO BE THE STUPIDEST PLACE I'VE
EVER WORKED AT."
BUT NOW, LOOK, LOOK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIM DURING
THAT REPORT SAY CREDIT RATING
AGENCIES ACCEPTED CASH IN
EXCHANGE FOR TRIPLE-A RATINGS.
THAT MIGHT SOUND TO YOU LIKE A
BRIBE WHEN ACTUALLY IT'S MUCH
WORSE THAN THAT.
IT'S STANDARD BUSINESS PRACTICE.
AND DON'T TAKE THAT FROM A
POLITICAL IS A TIRIST.
TAKE IT FROM A SATIRICAL
POLITICIAN.
>> THE "WASHINGTON POST" DEPICTS
THE PROBLEM QUITE WELL IN THIS
SATIRICAL CARTOON.
NOW HERE YOU SEE THE RATING
AGENCIES GIVING THREE TENs TO
A FIGURE SKATER LABELEDDED WALL
STREET.
HE SAYS, "I PAY THEIR SALARIES."
THAT'S WHY HE'S GETTING THE
THREE TENs OR TRIPLE-A.
AND, YES, HE'S A FIGURE SKATER
AND HE'S DUMPING TRASH REALLY.
THERE YOU SEE AN APPLE CORE.
THERE'S A FISH.
HEAD.
SKELETON.
A BANANA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE DO ON THE
ICE.
YOU JUST DON'T WANT THAT.
THAT'S BAD.
>> John: HOW DO YOU NOT LOVE
THAT?
AL FRANKEN HAS CRACKD THE CODE
ON HOW TO TALK TO SENATORS.
AS THOUGH THEY WERE SIX-YEAR-OLD
CHILDREN.
NOW, THAT WAS BACK IN 2010 WHEN
SENATOR FRANKEN WAS PROPOSING A
CRAZY NEW SYSTEM WHERE RATING
AGENCIES WOULD NO LONGER BE
DIRECTLY PAID BY THE BANKS IN
DEALS THEY WERE RAISING.
MOST AMERICANS WOULD SAY THAT
SOUNDS SENSIBLE AND OBVIOUS.
WHAT WOULD THE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THOSE AMERICANS SAY?
>> HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS
ARE VOTED TO STRIP OUT SENATOR
AL FRANKEN'S CREDIT RATING
AGENCY AMENDMENT.
>> John: THAT'S.
THEY SAY GET THAT [BLEEP] OUT OF
OUR FINANCIAL REFORM BILL.
SO FRANKEN DIDN'T GET THE
AMENDMENT BUT HE DID GET THE
NEXT BEST THING.
A STUDY BY THE S.E.C. THAT
ULTIMATELY PROVES HE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THERE BEING A CONFLICT OF
INTEREST.
HOW DID THEY COVER THAT?
ON THE NATION'S PREMIERE
FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK?
>> THE FRANKEN PROVISION, YES,
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS PROBABLY
NAMED AFTER, REQUIRED THE S.E.C.
TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF THE
FEASIBILITY OF A NEW SYSTEM IN
WHICH A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE
UTILITY OR BOARD WOULD ASSIGN
WORK TO THE AGENCIES ON
STRUCTURED PRODUCT RATINGS.
>> UH?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANY OF
THAT?
>> IT'S TOUGH TO MAKE THE JUMP
WITHOUT LIKE THE BILL MURRAY
AMENDMENT.
>> GRANDE DID IT.
THE BILL MURRAY AMENDMENT.
YOU KIND OF LAUGH AT THE BILL
MURRAY AMENDMENT.
>> John: TWO POINTS THERE.
FIRST YOU'RE A FINANCIAL
ANALYST.
YOUR ONE JOB IS TO UNDERSTAND
STUFF LIKE THIS ARCH EXPLAIN IT
TO US.
THAT'S LIKE A PILOT COMING ON
OVER THE P.A. SAYING, OH, THERE
ARE SO MANY BUTTONS UP THERE.
HOW DO YOU FLY THIS THING?
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TOO MANY BUTTONS.
WHO DESIGNED THIS?
AND, TWO, IF THE GUY WHO DOES
UNDERSTAND IT USED TO BE A
COMEDIAN, THAT MAKES YOU LOOK
