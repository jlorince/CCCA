IT'S WHY MITT ROMNEY FACED A BIT OF A CHALLENGE WHEN HE AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA BOTH
SPOKE LAST WEEK AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LATINO-ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS NELEO AS
WE FOUND OUT IN ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF OUR LATIN GRAMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES, THE
PANDERERS OR LOS PANDEROS.
YES.
YES.
NOW, THE GREETING AT THESE EVENTS IS EVERYTHING.
YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION.
FIRST UP, MITT ROMNEY
>> I COME TO YOU AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
OF AMERICA.
>> Jon: OOO.
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT WAS A PLEA FOR UNITY AS MUCH AS A GUY ADDRESSING A ROOM OR HE'S NOT
SURE EVERYBODY SPEAKS ENGLISH.
ARE YOU COMFORT-A-BLE YOUR CHAIR-O... CHAIR-O.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE OBAMA'S OPEN
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK AT NALEO.
(SPEAKING SPANISH) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: NOW I KNOW WHY THE ECONOMY ISN'T DOING SO WELL.
HE SPENT THE PAST THREE YEARS DOING ROSETTA STONE TAPES.
FIRST ONE GOES TO OBAMA.
NEXT UP, CONNECTION TO AND COMFORT WITH THE COMMUNITY.
MR. PRESIDENT?
>> I WANT TO THANK THE SECRETARY FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND FOR HER HARD WORK.
SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST LABOR SECRETARIES WE HAVE EVER HAD,
AND SHE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU EACH AND EVERY DAY.
>> Jon: WOW.
SOME OF MY BEST SECRETARIES OF LABOR ARE LATINO.
WELL DONE.
ROMNEY?
>> THROUGHOUT MY CAMPAIGN I'VE OFTEN HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK
ABOUT MY DAD AND HOW PROUD I AM OF HIM.
HE WAS BORN TO PARENTS, AMERICAN PARENTS LIVING IN MEXICO.
>> Jon: BING, BING, BING, BING,
MY DAD IS MEXICAN-ISH.
MEXICAN-ISH.
NOTE TO SELF.
THE JEWISH POTATO TREAT WITH THE FLAVOR OF THE SOUTHWEST, I CALL IT THE MEXICAN-ISH.
I'LL MAKE NOTHING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT ROUND CLEARLY GOES TO ROMNEY.
WE MOVE NOW TO OUR FINAL ROUND WORTH DOUBLE POINTS.
THE LEGISLATIVE PANDEROS.
BARACK OBAMA
>> ON FRIDAY WE ANNOUNCED WE'RE LIFTING THE SHADOW OF DEPORTATION FROM DESERVING YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO WERE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AS CHILDREN.
THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
>> Jon: THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
ONE WEEK BEFORE COMING HERE WAS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT.
GOT TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT.
MITT ROMNEY
>> SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED IF I WILL LET STAND THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER.
THE ANSWER IS THAT I WILL PUT IN PLACE MY OWN LONG-TERM SOLUTION THAT WILL REPLACE AND SUPERSEDE
THE PRESIDENT'S TEMPORARY MEASURE.
>> Jon: SUPERSEDING THE PRESIDENT'S TEMPORARY MEASURE.
WOW.
HERE'S THE ONLY WAY HE COULD HAVE SAID THAT TO LESS EXCITEMENT.
LIKE A TATTOO, AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS GET ON A SPRING BREAK MEXICAN BENDER, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS YET.
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE IT.
BUT IT WILL BE PERMANENT.
