FOR GOD'S SAKE, LOOK AT YOU!
WHAT, DID YOU START WHEN YOUWERE NINE? COME ON!
>> READ THE BOOK, MAN. I STARTEDWHEN I WAS FIVE.
>> Jon: IT IS -- THAT'SINTERESTING.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: YOUR FORMATIVE YEARS,YOU RECALL SEEING A WHAT WAS IT,
A J.F.K. RALLY?
>> J.F.K. RIGHT HERE IN NEWYORK IN STUYVESANT TOWN.
>> Jon: RIGHT, CAME TOSTUY-TOWN.
>> Jon: A WONDERFUL PICTURE INTHE BOOK ABOUT THAT.
>> A WOMAN WHO LOOKED AFTERME WHEN MY MOTHER WAS AT WORK,
GREAT WOMAN NAMED JESSE BERRY,AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN TOOK
CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS SOSHE COULD TAKE CARE OF HER OWN,
HEARD THAT J.F.K. WAS COMING 10DAYS BEFORE THE 1960 ELECTION,
AND SHE SAID LET'S GO OUT ANDSEE.
AND SHE PUT ME ON A MAILBOX.
I WATCHED THIS INCREDIBLE SCENE.
AND, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'TUNDERSTAND ALL OF IT BUT IT JUST
SEEMED SO IMPORTANT TO ME -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THAT GOT ME GOING INPOLITICS.
AND I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THETIME BECAUSE SHE'S LONG GONE,
BUT I WONDER WHAT SHE WOULDTHINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT I
ENDED UP WORKING FOR THE FIRSTAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES WHICH WASUNIMAGINABLE AT THAT TIME.
>> Jon: RIGHT. MY GUESS IS SHEWOULD BE INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU.
>> THAT WAS, THAT WAS MY HUNCHAS WELL.
PROBABLY BEST SHE DOESN'T KNOW.
>> Jon: YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. ITHINK IT'S BEST.
>> YES, YES.
>> Jon: I HAD THE SAMEEXPERIENCE.
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT, IT'SINTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WERE
FORMED IN THE CRUCIBLEOF IDEALISM.
THAT SORT OF WAR ON POVERTY, THECIVIL RIGHTS,
ALL THESE INCREDIBLE LEGISLATIVEACHIEVEMENTS.
MY FIRST SORT OF POLITICALAWAKENING WAS WATERGATE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: I CAN REMEMBER BEING INA HOTEL IN NEW YORK CITY ON
ELECTION DAY, McGOVERN/NIXONIN '72 AND I REMEMBER THOSE VANS
THAT USED TO DRIVE THROUGH THESTREETS AND CALL OUT FOR
PEOPLE TO COME AND VOTE.
BUT THE BOOK'S TITLE SORT OFINSINUATES YOUR HOPE, THE FACT
THAT YOU REALLY STILL, EVENSPENDING TIME IN WASHINGTON,
BELIEVE IN THIS PROCESS.
>> I REALLY DO. YOUKNOW, THE EPIGRAM ON THE BOOK
IS FROM ROBERT KENNEDY, ANDIT SAYS "THE FUTURE IS NOT
A GIFT, IT'S AN ACHIEVEMENT."
AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE. AND ITHINK POLITICS IS THE WAY,
AS MESSY AND AS FRUSTRATING ANDAS AGGRAVATING, AND AS MUCH AS
IT GENERATES MATERIALFOR YOU EVERY NIGHT.
>> Jon: I APPRECIATE THAT.
>> IT IS, IT IS ALSO THE VEHICLEBY WHICH WE MAKE PROGRESS AND
MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE HAD A ROUGH SIX YEARS WITHTHE PRESIDENT IN WASHINGTON AND,
YET, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE PEOPLEWHO HAVE HEALTHCARE TODAY WHO
DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> WE HAVE 160,000 --
>> Jon: BUT SEE THIS -- THISBRINGS UP A GOOD POINT.
SO IN THE BOOK, YOU DESCRIBE ASA POLITICAL STRATEGIST, YOU SAID
TO THE PRESIDENT, DON'T DO THIS.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: DO NOT DO THISHEALTHCARE.
YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON EDUCATION.>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AS A FATHER, AS A HUMAN,IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL
TO YOUR FAMILY.
>> RIGHT.
WELL, IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TOFAMILIES LIKE MY FAMILY WAS WHEN
MY DAUGHTER WAS YOUNG. I HAVE ADAUGHTER, LAUREN, WHO AT
SEVEN MONTHS OLD STARTED HAVINGSEIZURES --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND DIDN'T STOP FOR 19YEARS. AND AT THAT TIME I WAS
A REPORTER AT THE CHICAGOTRIBUNE, AND WASN'T MAKING MUCH
MONEY, AND WE HAD TO PAY $10,000OR MORE OUT OF POCKET EVERY
YEAR -- >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> FOR HER MEDICATIONS AND OTHERTHINGS THAT INSURANCE WOULDN'T
COVER. COULDN'T GETOTHER INSURANCE BECAUSE
SHE HAD A PREEXISTING CONDITION,ALMOST WENT BANKRUPT.
SO I KNEW WHY WE NEEDED TOREFORM THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
BUT MY JOB WAS TO TELL HIMWHAT THE POLITICS OF IT WERE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND I DID, AND YOU KNOW,SEVEN PRESIDENTS HAD TRIED,
SEVEN HAD FAILED, VERYDIFFICULT.
AND HE -- AND, I'LL NEVER FORGETIT.
HE SAID, I GET ALL THAT, BUT,WHAT, ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SIT
HERE EIGHT YEARS, AND PUT OURAPPROVAL RATING ON THE SHELF
AND JUSTADMIRE IT OR ARE WEGOING TO DRAW DOWN ON IT
AND DO SOME THINGS THATMEAN SOMETHING?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND HE SAID, IF WE DON'T DOIT NOW, WE'LL NEVER GET IT DONE.
AND JON, THE NIGHT THAT ITPASSED AFTER THIS EPIC FIGHT,
I WENT INTO MY OFFICE, WE WEREALL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND I BROKE DOWN AND
I CRIED BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUTALL THE FAMILIES WHO WOULDN'T
HAVE TO GO WHAT MY FAMILY DIDAND I WENT AND FOUND THE
PRESIDENT, I THANKED HIM, AND HEPUT HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND
HE SAID, THAT'S WHY WE DO THEWORK.
AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
>> Jon: WOW, SEE IF I WERE HIM IWOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY LIKE,
I TOLD YOU...>>THAT WAS IMPLIED.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: AND THEN I WOULD HAVE
BEEN, LIKE, BOOM!AND DROPPEDTHE MIC.
THAT'S JUST ME.
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT WAS IMPLIED, YEAH.
>> Jon: THAT WAS IMPLIED.>> YEAH.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD.
WE'LL COME BACK. WE'LL TALKA LITTLE BIT MORE WITH
DAVID AXELROD RIGHT AFTER THIS.
