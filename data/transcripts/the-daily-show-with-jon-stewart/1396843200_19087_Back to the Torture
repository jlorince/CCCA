[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SHOWTONIGHT.
WE'VE A BEAUTIFUL SHOW TONIGHT.
TONIGHT'S GUEST MATT TAIBBI, AJOURNALIST, AUTHOR OF "THE
DIVIDE:  AMERICAN INJUSTICE INTHE AGE OF THE WEALTH GAP."
IT'S A LOVE STORY.
IT'S QUITE LOVELY.
I ADDED THAT LAST PART.
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT OF COURSEBEGINS IN CONGRESS.
LAST WEEK THE SENATEINTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE VOTED TO
DECLASSIFY A COMPREHENSIVEREPORT ON OUR COUNTRY'S USE OF
UM -- I GUESS WHAT THE C.I.A.
WOULD CALLED SUPERAGGRESSIVE TERRORIST SUSPECT SPA
TREATMENTS DURING THE BUSHADMINISTRATION.
[LAUGHTER]ANYWAY I ASSUME THAT THE
DECLASSIFIED REPORT ISEXCULPATORY AND REAFFIRMS THIS
NATION'S COMMITMENT TO THEAMERICAN VALUES.
>> THE REPORT EXPOSES BRUTALITYTHAT STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO
OUR VALUES AS A NATION.
IT CHRONICLES A STAIN ON OURHISTORY THAT MUST NEVER BE
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN.
THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICANS DO.
>> YES, THIS IS NOT WHATAMERICANS -- EXCEPT WE DID.
WE DON'T -- -- WE DON'T DO BUTWE -- LIKE WITH YOUR INTERNMENT
CAMPS OR WHAT DO YOU CALL ITTHERE -- SLAVERY -- AMERICA HAS
A HISTORY OF DOING A TREMENDOUSAMOUNT OF STUFF THAT WE DON'T
DO.
[LAUGHTER]WE ARE A MORAL PEOPLE IN
HINDSIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT SINCE THE SENATE IS BRINGING
ENHANCED INTERROGATION ORFREEDOM QUIZZES UP,
[LAUGHTER]LET'S TAKE A STROLL DOWN THINGS
WE WOULD LIKE TO ERASE FROMOUR MEMORY LANE AND CHECK IN ON
HOW THE GENTLEMEN BEHIND THEENHANCED INTERROGATION PROGRAM
ARE DEALING WITH THEIR TWISTEDLEGACY.
I WAS A STRONG ADVOCATE OF HOWPUT TOGETHER THE ENHANCED
INTERROGATION PROGRAM.
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT TORTURE.
IT WASN'T TORTURE.
[LAUGHTER]>> IF IT WERE TORTURE I WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE PERSON AND -- BUT I'MNOT A TERRIBLE PERSON.
I'M LOVELY.
[ LAUGHTER ]I'M WARM, I'M ENGAGING, I'M THE
TOTAL PACKAGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]QUACK.
BY THE WAY THAT'S DICK CHENEYDENYING THAT HE TORTURED FROM A
ROOM THAT LOOKS LIKE A PLACEWHERE YOU WOULD TORTUREPEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]PERHAPS DANK IS HIS COLOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT I KNOW THAT MR. CHENEY SAYS
IT WASN'T TORTURE BUT THISREPORT MADE IT SEEM AWFUL
TORTURE-ISH.
>> THE REPORT ALSO REVEALS A NEWCASE OF ABUSE NEVER BEFORE
DISCLOSED. IN 2003A DETAINEE WAS TAKEN TO A C.I.A.
SECRET PRISON NEAR KABULWHERE HE WAS DUNKED
INTO A TUB OF ICE WATER, HELDFORCIBLY UNDER WATER AND
REPEATEDLY BEATEN.
>> SEE UH WE'RE HELPING HIM.
THE ICE WATER ACTS AS ANANTI-INFLAMMATORY
TO HELP THE BEATINGS HEAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: DOES THE VICE
PRESIDENT HAVE ANY REGRETS?
>> CHENEY WENT ON TO TELL THENEWSPAPER QUOTE, IF I WOULD
HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVERAGAIN, I WOULD.
THE RESULTS SPEAK FORTHEMSELVES.
>> Jon: HE'S LIKE THE WILFORDBRIMLEY OF TORTURE.
HI THIS, IS DICK CHENEY FORWATERBOARDING.
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
[LAUGHTER]WE KNOW THE USE OF WORD TORTURE
IS DISPUTED BUT CHENEY SPEAKSABOUT RESULTS.
WHAT ABOUT THESE RESULTS?
>> THE C.I.A. DESCRIBED ITSPROGRAM REPEATEDLY BOTH TO THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANDEVENTUALLY TO CONGRESS AS
GETTING UNIQUE OTHERWISEUNOBTAINABLE INTELLIGENCE
THAT HELPED DISRUPTTERRORIST PLOTS AND SAVE
THOUSANDS OF LIVES.WAS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE?
VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY SAID ITWAS TRUE SO I HAVE NO REASON TO
DOUBT IT WASN'T TRUE. I MEAN,
IF YOU CAN'T TRUST A MAN THATSHOT HIS OWN FRIEND IN THE FACE
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS A BIRDI DON'T KNOW WHO --
>> THE ANSWER IS NO.
>> Jon: I'M SO NAIVE.
YOU GOT ME AGAIN.
YOU OLD FACE SHOOTING FELLA.
[ LAUGHTER ]ALL RIGHT.
SO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY'SRESPONSE TO HIS ROLE, YOU LIKE
THAT?
VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY'S RESPONSETO HIS ROLE IN THIS SHAMEFUL
EPISODE OF AMERICAN HISTORY ISABJECT BLACK AND WHITE REALITY
DENIAL.
HOW DOES HIS COHORT DONALDRUMSFELD LIVE WITH HIMSELF,
I'M SORRY DEAL WITH IT.
LET'S FIND OUT IN A CLIPFROM THIS NEW
ERROL MORRIS DOCUMENTARYTHE UNKNOWN KNOWN.
>> WHAT ABOUT THESE SO-CALLEDTORTURE MEMOS?
>> THERE WERE WHAT?
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OR THREE?
I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUTTHERE WERE NOT ALL OF THESE
SO-CALLED MEMOS.
>> Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT HEDID?
THROUGH SHEER SEMANTIC WILL THEMAN DEFLECTED THE QUESTION OF
WHETHER OR NOT WE TORTURED TOACCUSE HIS QUESTIONER OF THE
HIGHER CRIME:  EXAGGERATION OF AMEMO COUNT.
AT LONG LAST ERROL MORRIS HAVEYOU NO SHAME?
I'M SORRY MR. RUMSFELD. YOU WEREMID TURD POLISH?
>> THEY WERE MISCHARACTERIZED ASTORTURE MEMOS AND THEY CAME NOT
OUT OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATIONPER SE BUT OUT OF THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OFJUSTICE BLESSED BY THE
ATTORNEY GENERL THE SENIOR LEGALOFFICIAL OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA HAVING BEENNOMINATED BY A PRESIDENT
AND CONFIRMED BY THE UNITEDSTATES SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY.
LITTLE DIFFERENT CAST I JUST PUTON IT THAN THE ONE YOU DID.
I'LL CHALK THAT ONE UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: MOMMY?
MOMMY, I DON'T WANT TO GO TOGRANDPA'S HE'S GOING TO DO THAT
FINGER THING AGAIN.
LOOK AT (bleep) PROUD HE IS OFHAVING PUT A LOT OF
DIFFERENT WORDS IN BETWEEN BUSHADMINISTRATION AND TORTURE WHILE
NOT IN ANY EXPLICIT WAYCHANGING THE MEANINGS OF THOSE
WORDS OR REFUTING THE CHARGE.BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE
HAPPY, I'M HAPPY AND IASSUME THAT IS HAPPINESS AND NOT
HIS TEETH TRYING DESPERATELY TOESCAPE HIS FACE.
