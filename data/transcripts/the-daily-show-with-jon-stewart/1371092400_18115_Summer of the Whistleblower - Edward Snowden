EMOTIONALLY MA N MANIPULATED
THAN THIS.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS IT'S CLEARLY
NOT YET ON THE LEVEL OF, SAY,
EDWARD SNOWDEN'S REVELATIONS.
SNOWDEN, OF COURSE, THE N.S.A.
CONTRACTOR WHO REVEALED THE
DETAILS OF THEIR CLASSIFIED
PRISM PROGRAM.
NOW, THAT IS A WHISTLE THAT HAS
CAUSED TROUBLE.
NOT JUST TO THE N.S.A. BUT FOR
THE MEDIA.
THEY FACE A VERY DIFFICULT
QUESTION: DO THEY PRIORITIZE THE
LEGAL AND ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS
OF AN UNPRECEDENTED GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM OR DO THEY
GO U.S. WEEKLY ON THE MESSENGER?
I'M JUST GOING TO WRITE DOWN
WHICH ONE I THINK AND PUT MY
ANSWER INTO THIS ENVELOPE.
>> WHO IS EDWARD SNOWEDEN?
>> THE CIVILIAN CONTRACTOR
WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AT THE
N.S.A..
>> A 29-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL
DROPOUT.
HE WENT TO ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE
SCHOOL IN COF ON THE, MARYLAND.
>> I THINK HE GOT HIS G.E.D..
>> HE GAVE TO THE LIBERTARIAN
CANDIDATE RON PAUL.
>> HE WAS LIVING IN HAWAII WITH
HIS GIRLFRIEND WHO TURNS OUT IS
SOME SORT OF -- LIKE AN ACROBAT
OR GYMNAST.
>> John: OH, LOOK AT THAT!
MAYBE I'M GETTING THE HANG OF
THIS JOB.
MAYBE I WAS RIGHT.
HONESTLY I CAN'T THINK OF
ANYTHING LESS RELEVANT TO BE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW THAN
WHERE EDWARD SNOWDEN WENT TO
MIDDLE SCHOOL.
>> THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF THE
U.S. INTELLIGENCE LEAKS IS STILL
IN HIDING BUT HIS GIRLFRIEND AND
HER POLE-DANCING YOUTUBE CHANNEL
ARE FRONT AND CENTER.
>> John: OH FOR (BLEEP)'S SAKE!
(LAUGHTER)
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR MYSELF
SAY THIS BUT I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN ANY POLE DANCING YOUTUBE
CHANNELS RIGHT NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
STILL I GUESS WE NEED ALL THAT
INFORMATION ON SNOWDEN OTHERWISE
WE WON'T KNOW WHICH INCREDIBLY
REDUCTIVE LABEL TO PIN ON HIM.
>> EDWARD SNOWED SEASON A HERO
TO MANY PEOPLE.
HE'S A PUJ.
HE'S A LOSER.
>> THIS MAN IS AN AMERICAN HERO.
>> HELL KNOW HE'S NOT A HERO.
>> HE'S DONE A GREAT SERVICE.
>> INCREDIBLY BRAVE.
>> HE'S A TRAITOR.
>> A DEFECTOR OR TRAITOR.
>> LOOK AT THAT GUY.
HE'S A WEASEL.
CAN WE PUT HIS FACE ON THE
SCREEN.
>> WITH WE ALLOWED TO SAY THAT?
>> HE LOOKS LIKE A WEASEL.
>> OKAY.
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D BE SO
QUICK TO JUMP TO THE ARGUMENT
THAT HE MUST BE WHAT HE LOOKS
LIKE.
ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN WHAT YOU
LOOK LIKE IS THE GUY IN THE FRAT
HOUSE WHO CAN GET YOU ROOFIES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
