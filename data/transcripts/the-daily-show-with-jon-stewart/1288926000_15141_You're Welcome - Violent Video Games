>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
THIS TUESDAY -- THIS TUESDAY
WHICH WAS ELECTION DAY WHILE
DEMOCRATS WERE GETTING THEIR
ASSES HANDED TO THEM BY
REPUBLICANS OUR THIRD BRANCH OF
GOVERNMENT WAS DEALING WITH A
DIFFERENT TYPE OF BLOODBATH.
>> DO CHILDREN NEED PROTECTION
FROM VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES OR IS
VIRTUAL VIOLENCE A FORM OF FREE
SPEECH.
THE SPORT IS LOOKING AT BANNING
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES FOR KIDS
YOUNGER THAN 18.
>> Jon: I LOVE THAT GAME HOW
TO WE KEEP VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES
OUT OF THE HANDS OF CHILDREN.
WE TURN TO JOHN HODGMAN AND HIS
SEGMENT YOU'RE WELCOME.

>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH
JOHN, FOR JOIN US TONIGHT.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
SHOULD THE SUPREME COURT BAN
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES FOR
CHILDREN?
>> THAT'S ABSURD, JON.
THEY ARE A FORM OF EXPRESSION.
THEY ARE THE NOVELS OF THE NEXT
GENERATION TO.
BAN THEM WOULD BE LIKE MANNING
MOBY DICK BECAUSE CAPTAIN AHAB
TEARS THE WHALES HEAD OFF, SET
SETS HIS HEAD ON FIRE.
WHICH HAPPENS ACCORDING TO THE
GAME I PLAYED.
>> Jon: IT'S A FIRST AMENDMENT
ISSUE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE JUSTICES DON'T UNDERSTAND
THIS BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT THEY
PROBABLY NEVER PLAYED A
INDIVIDUAL YES GAME THEY WOULD
EVER LIKE WHICH BRINGS ME MY
FIRST SOLUTION.
>> Jon: SHOWS NOT ALL GAMES
ARE VIOLENT.
>> SHOW THEM ONE AWESOME GAME TO
INN WHICH SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
GET TO BE VIOLENT.
GIVE THEM A TASTE OF WHAT IT'S
LIKE.
WITH JUSTICE SCALIA IT'S EASY.
WE HAVE A VIDEO GAME IN WHICH AN
ITALIAN AMERICAN DISPENSES HARSH
JUSTICES WITH A HEAVY GAVEL.
>> Jon: THAT'S DONKEY KONG.
>> IT'S STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST
MAN VERSUS THE EVIL APE KONG.
>> Jon: VERSUS THE REST OF THE
COURT?
>> YOU KNOW I HAVE A VIDEO GYM,
RIGHT, JON?
>> WE'VE GOT BETA ON A GAME THE
SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO LOVE
HABEAS CORPSUS BLOOD VERSUS THE
BOARD OF ZOMBIES.
IT'S THE FIRST NINE PERSON
SHOOTER.
>> JUSTICE IS BLIND AND NOW YOU
ARE, TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK
FLATTERING THE JUSTICES WITH A
NINE PERSON SHOOTER IS GOING TO
WIN THEM OVER.
>> WELL, OKAY IF THE FIRST
AMENDMENT WON'T WORK JOHN LET'S
MOVE ON TO SECOND AMENDMENT
REMEDIES.
GUNS, JON.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FOR THE
FIRST TIME EVER COMBINING VIDEO
GAMES WITH GUNS.
>> Jon: THEY'VE GUNS.
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT REAL GUNS,
JON.
WAL-MART WOULD NEVER DREAM OF
BANNING ACTUAL FIREARMS FROM
THEIR STORE.
THEY SELL VIDEO GAMES THERE.
>> ASSUMING THEY SELL SCOTCH
TAPE, WELCOME TO THE NEW FAMILY
GAME NIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WHY WOULD YOU NEED AN
ASSAULT RIFLE FOR FAMILY GAME
NIGHT?
>> WHAT, JON, YOU ARE SAYING I
CAN'T EVEN DEFEND MY FAMILY
ANYMORE ON GAME NIGHT WHEN WE'RE
MOST VULNERABLE?
>> Jon: JOHN, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOUR SOLUTIONS STILL JUST MAKE
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES AVAILABLE TO
CHILDREN.
>> AVAILABLE, JON.
THE KEY IS TO MAKE THEM LESS
ASSURING TO CHILDREN -- ALLURING
TO CHILDREN.
WHICH YOUNGSTER WOULDN'T WANT TO
BE THE THUG IN GRAND THEFT AUTO?
IT'S EVERY KID'S DREAM.
WHAT IF WE COULD USE TECHNOLOGY
TO TAKE OUT THE SO CALLED HEROS
OF THE MOST VIOLENT GAMES AND
REPLACE THEM WITH THE
SOPHISTICATED MUSINGS OF PUBLIC
RADIO'S IRA GLASS.
>> Jon: EVEN JOHN, IF THAT
WERE A GOOD IDEA, I'M NOT SURE
IT'S POSSIBLE.
>> JORNG AT MY COMPANY WE DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE MEANINGS OF THE
WORDS EVEN IF IT WERE A GOOD
IDEA I'M NOT SURE IT'S POSSIBLE.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> THIS SAY CARJACK MOTHER
(bleep) I'M GOING TO SHOOT
YOUR PENIS OFF.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> THAT WORKS.
IT'S ADULTS IT'S MATURE,
SOPHISTICATED.
DO ANOTHER ONE.
>> LET'S ROLL!
>> Jon: THAT'S ACTUALLY --
THAT WAS IRA GLASS.
>> YES, OF COURSE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU AND I LOVE IRA GLASS BUT TO
CHILDREN IT'S CATNIP IF KIDS
WERE CATS AND NIP
