HOOKER'S TEET, IT AIN'T WORTH KNOW APPROXIMATING ABOUT.
BUT ACTUALLY-- THE LEGALLIZATION OF MARIJUANA IS A SERIOUS ISSUE.
IT'S GOT MAJOR RAM ANY SITUATION-- RAM MI MI-- RAMIFICATIONS FOR AMERICA'S FAILED WAR ON DRUGS.
ALING TAKES US THROUGH THE NEW LAW AND WHAT THIS MEANS.
>> JON, I'M HERE IN THE MILE HIGH CITY, CAPITAL OF WHAT JUST BECAME THE MILE HIGH STATE.
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
ALL THIS POT JARGON IS FOREIGN TO ME.
PASS THE DUTCHIE ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE?
I MEAN WHY DON'T THEY PASS IT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SMOKED POT.
4R56 (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SETTLE DOWN WITH THE WORD PLAY AND TELL US ABOUT THE REFERENDUM.
>> FINE, WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY.
AS OF TUESDAY IN COLORADO YOU CAN NOW CARRY WITHOUT PENALTY UP TO AN OUNCE OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA.
HOWEVER MUCH THAT IS.
I DON'T KNOW.
IS THAT A LOT?
I DON'T SMOKE POT OR HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF SECOND GRADE LEVEL WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH AN OUNCE IS, IT IS ENOUGH TO SEND YOU A JAIL
FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS IN FLORIDA.
>> SOUNDS LIKE FLORIDA COULD USE A REEFER REN DUMB OF THEIR OWN.
SINCE THEY CAN'T VOTE WITH A FELONY CONVICTION ON THE RECORD.
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
MUNCHIES, COTTON MOUTH.
>> Jon: IT'S NOT FUNNY, ANCHORS ARE MAKING A JOKE ABOUT POT, IT'S KIND OF CUTE
HOW THEY USED TO SMOKE POT BUT NOW THEY DON'T.
EVEN THOUGH NEARLY HALF OF AMERICAN TEENAGER SMOKED POT BUT ONLY CERTAIN GET ARRESTED AND HAVE THEIR
LIVES RUINED.
DISPROPORTIONAL LEITH HURTS PEOPLE OF COLOR.
SIMPLE POSSESSION PEOPLE IN COLORADO.
>> YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE READ THOSE INCARCERATION STATS ON WEED?
>> Jon: IT NICE, LOOK, WE SPENT $8 BILLION A YEAR LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR MARIJUANA.
>> VERY TRUE, IN FACT I MET TWO VICTIMS OF THESE DRACONIAN LAWS.
>> Jon: GOOD.
>> NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS BRUTALLY ARRESTED FOR TOCQUING JUST THE TINY BIT OF LABRADOR WHICH I'M
GUESSING IS SOME SORT OF NARCOTIC.
>> Jon: THERE IS NO WAY WILL YOU COVER THIS STORY SERIOUSLY, IS THERE.
>> LOOK THIS IS HOW WE DO TV NEWS, JON.
YOU WANT A WELL RESEARCHED REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE OR YOU WANT FOOTAGE OF ME ON A
WINDBREAKER ON THE BEACH CLINGING TO A LAMPPOST WHILE WAVES TICKLE ME ASS?
HUH?
>> Jon: LAMPPOST.
>> DAMN RIGHT YOU WANT THE LAMPPOST.
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO JOIN SOME GUYS FOR A VAPORIZER SESSION.
WHICH I BELIEVE IS A NEW WAY OF GETTING POTTED UP.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I DIDN'T
