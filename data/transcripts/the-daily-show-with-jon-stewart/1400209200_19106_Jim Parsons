>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THIS FILM, THIS FILM ISVERY QUICKLY SOMETHING
LARRY KRAMER PUT TOGETHER IN 80-- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
>> I BELIEVE THE STAGE PLAY OFIT WAS FIRST DONE IN '84, '85.
IT WAS REALLY -- IT WAS SO GOINGON RIGHT THEN, WHAT WAS
HAPPENING IN THE MOVIE, THESTAGE PLAY ACTUALLY HAD THE SET
WAS LIKE THESE WHITE WALLSWHERE THEY ADDED THE
NAMES OF THE DYINGAS THEY WERE DYING.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THIS WAS THEEARLY PART OF THE TERRIBLE AIDSCRISIS.
>> THE AIDS CRISIS. YES. RIGHT.
>> Jon: BEFORE EVEN REAGAN ITHINK HAD EVER MENTIONED IT
PUBLICLY, LARRY KRAMER HADALREADY WRITTEN THIS BRILLIANTPLAY.
>> YES. YES. ANDSO EVERYTHING WAS STILL
OBVIOUSLY SHUFFLING AROUNDFIGURING OUT,
THE EMERGENCY WAS IN ITSGREATEST THROES AT THAT MOMENT.
NOW HERE WE ARE 30 YEARS LATERAND IT'S, IN SOME WAYS, ALL THE
MORE, TO ME, POWERFUL ANDINTERESTING TO SEE THIS STORY
NOW.
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHODON'T KNOW WHAT WENT ON.
YOU KNOW, MYSELFINCLUDED. AND EVEN IF YOU KNOW
INTELLECTUALLY, TO SEE ITPERSONIFIED IN THIS
WAY, YOU LEARN IT IN A WAY INYOUR HEART THAT YOU DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW. IT IS SAD BUT IT'SWONDERFUL.
IT'S WONDERFUL.
YOU FEEL -- WHEN I SEE IT, IFEEL SOMEWHAT SAD WHEN IT'S
OVER, BUT YOU FEEL -- I DON'TKNOW, A CERTAIN PEACE, TOO, AND
A CONNECTION TO HUMANITY, IFTHAT DOESN'T SOUND RIDICULOUS TO
YOU.
>> Jon: NO.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THOUGH?
>> Jon: WE HAVE FEELINGS.
>> I KNOW YOU DO.
YOU'RE A VERY WARM, SENSITIVEMAN.
>> Jon: BUT THE URGENCY, THEURGENCY IS WHAT'S SO INTERESTING
TO ME. >> YEAH.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THE PLAYCAPTURES THAT CONFUSION OF THAT
TIME AND THE URGENCY OF ACTION.
>> UTTER CONFUSION. WELL,EXACTLY.
AND THE THING WE ALWAYS TALKEDABOUT WHEN I WAS DOING THE STAGE
PLAY WITH GEORGE WOLFE, WHEN IDID THE MOVIE WITH RYAN MURPHY,
EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT, IT'S AREAL, LIVE HORROR FILM. THERE IS
LITERALLY A KILLER ON THE LOOSE,WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING
FROM, WE DON'T WHAT IT IS ANDEVERYONE IS RUNNING AS FAST AS
THEY CAN. ONE OF THE FUNTHINGS ABOUT DOING IT WAS --
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: WELL, GO ON.
>> WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, I FOUND THE HUMOR IN THENORMAL HEART. BUT SERIOUSLY,
IT WAS GOING THROUGH ALL THESETHINGS AND TRYING TO -- I
HAD TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF, NOE-MAILS, NO CELL PHONES, NO
INTERNET, AND IT SEEMS SOOBVIOUS UNTIL YOU'RE IN THOSE
SCENES WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TOHELP PEOPLE, WARN PEOPLE, GET
PEOPLE TO A HOSPITAL, AND YOUREALIZE HOW FEW THINGS IN
COMPARISON WE HAD.
TIMES HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH. SOQUICKLY.
>> Jon: SO MUCH OF IT WASABOUT INFORMATION.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATIONAND FINDING IT.
AND I FIND MYSELF THIS WAY WITHMY KIDS.
THEY'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE, ARETHERE PIGMY GOATS?
AND I WILL HAVE TO SAY, WELL,WHY DON'T YOU LOOK IT UP?
BUT IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULD HAVEWENT, I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
>> YEAH. COMPLETELY. (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LIKE YOU JUST WOULD,THAT'D BE IT?
LIKE YOU JUST, I DON'T KNOW!>> NO.
>> LET'S DO SOMETHING ELSE.
>> I MEAN, WHEN YOU, WHENBOTH OF US, I'M SURE, WENT
THROUGH SCHOOL, IT WAS TRIPSTO THE LIBRARY.
>> Jon: SURE. YEP.
>> THAT'S HOW YOU FOUNDEVERYTHING. YOU CHECKED OUT
REALLY HEAVY BOOKS AND WROTEREALLY BAD PAPERS, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: AND WE DID THEM ON,DID YOU DO THEM, WELL, I'M OLDERTHAN
YOU, BUT WE USEDTO DO THEM ON THE
TYPE WRITER AND WHEN YOU MADE AMISTAKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO
BACK WITH THE WHITEOUT ANDTYPE IT AGAIN.
>> I TRANSITIONED TO A WORDPROCESSOR BEFORE I FINISHED WITH
SCHOOL, SO I DIDN'T, IDIDN'T, BUT I DID IT WHILE
I, THERE WERE WHITEOUT SHEETSYOU COULD DO.
>> Jon: EXACTLY, AND I WOULDWORK ON MY ABACUS.
AGAIN, I'M OLDER THEN YOU.
>> I KNOW, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT.THOSE WERE GONE WHEN I WAS --
>> Jon: I WANTED TO ASK YOU,THOUGH, BECAUSE
DOING A PIECE LIKE THIS FOR THESTAGE IS SUCH A DIFFERENT
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: PERFORMANCE THAN DOINGSOMETHING THAT IS BEING FILMED
FOR TELEVISION, HAVING DONE ITAS A PLAY, DID YOU HAVE TO
RECALIBRATE? WHAT WAS, >> TO A DEGREE --
>> Jon: WHAT'S THE PROCESS OFTRYING TO TRANSLATE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?
>> WELL, THE HARDEST THING WAS AVERY KIND OF SILLY-SOUNDING
THING, BUT THERE WAS ONLYONE OTHER GUY WHO WAS IN
THE PLAY WITH ME, YOU KNOW, JOEMANTELLO,
AND HE ACTUALLY CHANGED PARTSFOR THE MOVIE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE IN THE SAMEPART.
>> I AM IN THE SAME PART.
BUT SO MUCH OF THE SCRIPT WASTHE SAME, THAT IT WAS HARD TO
GET USE TO HEARING PEOPLE WITHNEW VOICES WITH LINES
THAT'D YOU'D HEARDSAID OVER AND OVER.
BUT IT WAS BEING DONE SO WELLTHAT THAT QUICKLY WENT AWAY.
WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING,THOUGH, WAS, YOU KNOW, LIKE
HERE WE ARE NOW, AND EVERY TIMETHEY LAUGH, YOU FEEL IT AND IT
AFFECTS THINGS.
IN THIS CASE, IT WAS OBVIOUSLY,IT WAS A DRAMA, BUT THEY WERE SO
MOVED -- I GUESS PARTLY BECAUSEWE WERE PERFORMING -- IT WAS A
POWERFUL PIECE BUT PARTLYBECAUSE WE WERE PERFORMING AT
GROUND ZERO FOR ALL THECATASTROPHY
WE WERE IN NEW YORK.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I HAVE NEVER HEARD CRYINGLIKE THIS.
SO THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING TOKNOW AS WE WERE MAKING THIS
MOVIE THE POSSIBILITY OF THEPOWERFUL EFFECT THAT THIS COULD
DEFINITELY HAVE WHEN PEOPLE SAWIT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NORMALLY, I DON'T WORK ONSOMETHING WHERE YOU KIND OF HAVE
ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCETHAT AND FEEL THAT AND CARRY IT
WITH YOU INTO THE PROJECT.
>> Jon: YOU FELT ITS ABSENCEAS YOU --
>> NO, I FELT LIKE I KNOW WHATWE'RE HEADING TOWARDS.
>> Jon: OKAY.
>> I FELT LIKE, IF WE TELL THISSTORY CORRECTLY, THIS IS A
DEVASTATING LITTLE TALE.
>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> I WISH I COULD SAY SOMETHINGFUNNY HERE.
>> Jon: NOT AT ALL.
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WERE ABLETO IMPART ALSO TO THE OTHER
ACTORS WHO MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIARWITH ITS IMPACT IN THAT WAY?
>> I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
NOBODY ASKED ME TO. YOU KNOWWHAT, RYAN,
RYAN IS A WONDERFUL DIRECTOR,MURPHY, AND HE WOULD ASK A
COUPLE OF TIMES OF ME AND JOE,WHO HAD DONE IT, WHEN YOU DID
THE PLAY, WHAT HAPPENED HERE,BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
BUT IT WAS MORE OF THAT.EVERYBODY WAS, EVERYBODY WAS,
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEMWHY THEY JOINED UP, LIKE
MARK RUFFALO, ANDTAYLOR KITSCH, AND MATT BONER,
YOU KNOW, THEY KNEW WHYTHEY WERE THERE.
>> Jon: YOU ALWAYS DO TERRIFICWORK.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: "THE NORMAL HEART"APPEARS MAY 25.
>> MAY 25TH.
>> Jon: IT'S RYAN MURPHY OF"GLEE" SO THERE'S A LOT OF
SONGS IN IT. IT'S VERY --
