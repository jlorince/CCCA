>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A JOURNALIST
WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "CRISIS
CARAVAN", WHAT IS WRONG WITH
HUMANITARIAN AID?
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
LINDA POLMAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: IT'S ABSOLUTELY OUR
PLEASURE.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "CRISIS
CARAVAN" WHAT IS WRONG WITH
HUMANITARIAN AID.
I'VE BEEN TEAMING SOMEWHAT
BEREFT AT TIMES ABOUT CORRUPTION
WITHIN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND
WITHIN THE MEDIA.
IT'S NICE SEE IT'S ALSO IN
CHARITY.
>> HA, HA.
YES IT IS.
CHARITY LIKES TO HIDE BEHIND
KRUPS OF LOCAL POLITICS --
CORRUPTION OF LOCAL POLITICIANS.
IT GOES TO AFRICA AND WHEN AID
PROJECTS GO WRONG THEY BLAME THE
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.
IT'S THE HAITIAN GOVERNMENT
POCKETING MONEY THAT IS
HAPPENING BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT
OF CORRUPTION WITHIN OUR OWN
GOVERNANCE LIKE WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN HAITI RIGHT NOW
WITH THE AMERICAN MONEY.
>> Jon: THIS BRINGS UP AN
INTERESTING, A BILLION DOLLARS,
THEY SAY?
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS ALREADY
DONATED A BILLION DOLLAR TO
HAITI AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE TO
HELP PEOPLE HAVE TENTS AND FOOD,
FOR EXAMPLE.
BUT THAT'S THE EASY PART TO GIVE
PEOPLE FOOD AND TENTS.
NOW THE DIFFICULT PART SHOULD BE
STARTING, REBUILDING HAITI.
>> Jon: YOU UNDERSTAND OUR
GOVERNMENT IS ALSO BROKE.
[LAUGHTER]
THEY MAY BE HOLDING ON TO THE
MONEY BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY AND WATER
IN CONGRESS BEING TURNED OFF.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YES, WELL, PERHAPS THEY
SHOULD BE, YES.
BUT $1 BILLION IS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING.
IT'S PEANUTS.
>> Jon: THEY SAID $1 BILLION
IS BEING HELD.
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT
A GREAT DEAL OF THE DIFFICULTY
IN HUMANITARIAN AID IS
CORRUPTION IN THE REGIMES WHEN
YOU GO INTO A WAR-TORN AREA AND
YOU HAVE MONEY AND AID THAT IS
USED BY THE MILITARY OR THOSE
PEOPLE TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE.
>> YES, YES.
ASSED A ORGANIZATIONS YOU ARE
DEPENDENT ON -- AS AN
ORGANIZATION YOU ARE DEPENDENT
ON WHAT IS IN CHARGE -- WHO IS
IN CHARGE WHERE YOU GO.
AS A REFUGEE GEE CAMP YOU ARE
NOT IN CHARGE.
YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE YOUR WAY
INTO THE CAMP OR AN AREA.
IT DEPENDS ON WHO IS IN CHARGE
THERE HOW HIGH THE ENTRANCE FEE
IS.
>> Jon: YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT
SOMETIME THE AID PROJECT PROLONG
WAR.
>> WELL, I MEAN IF YOU -- FOR
EXAMPLE, NOW IN SOMALIA THERE'S
A HUGE INVESTIGATION GOING ON
ABOUT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM
WHICH IS A U.N. CHARITY.
THE WORLD FOOD PRAM IS INSIDE --
PROGRAM IS INSIDE SOMALIA WITH A
PROGRAM WORTH $425 MILLION PER
YEAR.
THE RESEARCHERS THAT LOOKED INTO
THE PROGRAM SAY THEY HAVE PROOF
THAT MORE THAN $200 MILLION OF
THE DOLLARS ARE DISAER PAOG
STRAIGHT INTO THE --
DISAPPEARING INTO THE POCKETS OF
WARLORDS.
$200 MILLION FOR WARLORDS IN
SOMALIA IS A LOT OF MONEY.
THEY CAN CONVERT TO WEAPONS,
THEY CAN RECRUIT SOLE SOLDIERS
SOX AID MONEY IS HELPING
WARLORDS TO FILL THEIR WAR
CHEST.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU THING BRING
UP WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HAITI AND
SOMALIA THE DIFFICULTY HERE.
IN HAITI THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING
ON TOP OF RUBBLE.
THEY NEED HOUSING, THEY NEED
REKRUGS.
YOU HAVE SOMALIA PEOPLE LIVING
IN THE SAME TERRIBLE CONDITIONS,
THE MONEY NEEDS TO GET THERE
IMMEDIATELY BUT IT'S BEING USED.
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN INCONQUERABLE
DILEMMA.
>> IF YOU WORK TOGETHER AS
DONORS ANDED A ORGANIZATIONS YOU
COULD MAKE A CHANGE.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS 64 DONORS
AND 10,000ED A ORGANIZATIONS ARE
DOING THEIR OWN THING THERE.
THEY ARE NOT COOPERATING.
THEY ARE NOT MAKING THIS
STRENGTH THERE.
THEY ARE NOT PUTTING THEIR MONEY
TOGETHER.
THEY ARE NOT DEFINING A CENTRAL
DPOAL -- GOAL.
WHAT ARE THEY WORKING TOWARDS IN
HAITI?
THEY DO THEIR OWN THING.
THEY RUSH THERE AND START DOING
THEIR OWN PROJECTS.
>> Jon: IS THAT ASKING TOO
MUCH OF A HUMANITARIAN GROUP TO
ALSO FUNCTION AS A NEGOTIATOR IN
A WAR TORN AREA TO BE THE FIST.
IF YOU ARE HOLDING SOMETHING OUT
IN YOUR HAND CAN YOU ALSO BE THE
FIST -- YOU KNOW, HOW CAN THEY
POSSIBLY ACCOMPLISH THAT?
ISN'T THAT THE U.N. OR WHOEVER
ELSE IS IN THERE KEEPING
STABILITY, ISN'T THAT THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY?
>> WE COULD MAKE IT THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF UNITED
NATIONS.
THE UNITED NATIONS IS ONLY THE
SUM OF WHAT MEMBERS STATES ALLOW
IT TO BE.
WE COULD MAKE THE UNITED NATIONS
RESPONSIBLE TO DO THOSE
NEGOTIATIONS AND WE -- THE
DONORS HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT IN
HAITI, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT THEN
IT'S DONOR COUNTRIES AND THE AID
ORGANIZATIONS ARE FREE TO IGNORE
THE UNITED NATIONS.
THEY ARE FREE TO DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT INSIDE THOSE
COUNTRIES.
ARE YOU WORRIED AT ALL THAT THIS
WILL SLOW DOWN AID OR PEOPLE
WON'T GIVE.
ARE YOU SAYING DON'T
GIVE?
>> IT'S GOING TO TAKE A
LOT OF WORK TO CHANGE IT
TO MAKE THEM WORK
TOGETHER, TO MAKE DONORS
AND THE ORGANIZATIONS
WORK TOGETHER.
UNTIL THAT TIME WE
SHOULD ASK THEM VERY,
VERY CRITICAL QUESTIONS.
IF THEY WANT OUR MONEY
FOR HAITI, ASK THEM IF
THEY ARE WORKING TOWARDS
A SHARED GOAL, IF THEY
ARE WORKING TO --
>> DIDN'T YOU JUST
CRITICIZE CONGRESS FOR
HOLDING THE MONEY BEFORE
ASKING QUESTIONS?
>> YES, BUT THE CONGRESS
IS --
>> Jon: YOU CAN SEE
HOW I'M CONFUSED.
>> YOUR CONGRESS IS NOT
WORKING TOGETHER WITH
THE 64 OTHER DONORS WHO
ARE WORKING INSIDE
HAITI.
THE AMERICAN CONGRESS
MAKE ISING ITS OWN
DECISIONS ABOUT ITS OWN
MONEY.
IT'S NOT WORKING
TOGETHER WITH THE 64
OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE
ALSO PUTTING -- PROMISED
TO PUT IN $8 BILLION
INTO HAITI.
IF AMERICAN CONGRESS
WOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH
OTHER CONGRESSES THAT
SAY THEY WANT TO HELP
HAITI THEN WOULD YOU
HAVE THIS ONE GOAL AND
THIS ONE CHEST AND WOULD
YOU COMBINE THE MONEY.
>> Jon: PUT IT ALL IN
THE KITTY.
>> YES, SIMPLY SAID,
YES.
>> Jon: WE GET IT ALL
TOGETHER AND WE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
CORRUPTION.
>> THAT WOULD BE NICE.
>> Jon: GOOD LUCK WITH
