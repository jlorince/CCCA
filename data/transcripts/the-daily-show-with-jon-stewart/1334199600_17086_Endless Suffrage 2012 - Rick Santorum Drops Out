COMEDY CENTRAL
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, YOUNG RICKY GERVAIS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, WE CAN ALL START TAKING BETS NOW ON WHAT ANIMAL HE'S GOING TO
MIME HAVING SEX WITH.
( LAUGHTER ).
MARSUPIAL.
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER ).
SO, LISTEN, FOLKS, IT'S OVER.
RICK SANTORUM, RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE, THE PENNSYLVANIA PRUDE SWEATER VEST JOHNSON, THE
KEYSTONE ( BLEEP ), ENDED HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN A
HEARTFELT CONCESSION SPEECH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
>> OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE WERE TOLD, "FORGET IT, YOU CAN'T WIN."
WE WERE WINNING.
WE WERE WINNING IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  IN FACT, YOU MAY KNOW IT AS LOSING.
( LAUGHTER ).
LIKE WIN, BUT IN REVERSE.
( LAUGHTER ) HANGING UPSIDE DOWN.
BUT EVEN IN DEFEAT, SANTORUM WAS CLEAR ON JUST HOW IMPRESSED WE SHOULD ALL BE THAT A WELL-KNOWN
FORMER TWO-TERM SENATOR LOBBYIST AND TELEVISION ANALYST EVEN GOT THIS FAR.
>> MIRACLE AFTER MIRACLE, THIS RACE WAS AS IMPROBABLE AS ANY RACE THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE FOR PRESIDENT.
>> Jon:  REALLY!
ANY RACE?
EVER, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, WERE YOU ALIVE IN 2008?
( LAUGHTER ) WHEN A BLACK GUY NAMED BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA BEAT A 48-TERM WAR
HERO SENATOR AND HIS FLAG PIN OF A RUNNING MATE?
WERE YOU ALIVE THEN?
BECAUSE THAT WAS PRETTY ( BLEEP ) WEIRD.
( LAUGHTER ).
SENATOR, YOU WEREN'T EVEN THE MOST IMPROBABLE THING IN THIS G.O.P. PRIMARY.
THAT TITLE I BELIEVE STILL GOES TO A POKE MAN-SINGING PITA MAGNATE, WHOSE BIG IDEA IN THIS
RACE WAS A NUMBER.
>> 9-9-9.
>> Jon:  9-9-9, BECAUSE TWO 9s WOULD BE STUPID.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND FOUR WOULD BE
