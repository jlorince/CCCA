AN EXCITING WEEK ININTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

SIX MILLION SEAT STADIUM.

POPE LEFT HOME TO SPREAD HISMESSAGE OF PEACE.
U.K. PRIME MINISTER DAVIDCAMERON VISITED THE
UNITED STATES LAST WEEKTO DISCUSS A WORLD ON
THE BRINK OF WIDER WAR.
WELL, I STILL THINK THOSETWO MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE
FREE WORLD ARE SQUANDERINGTHEIR CHANCE AT A HILARIOUS
BUDDY COP MOVIE.
I JUST THINK THE TWO OF THEM,ONE IS BLACK, ONE IS WHITE.
THEY'RE FROM DIFFERENT WORLD,JOHN BANGERS WAS AN UPTIGHT
PRIME MINISTER WHO ALWAYSPLAYED BY THE RULES UNTIL HE
MET HIS MASH, HENRY MASH.
NOW THEY FIGHT CRIME ANDARGUE ABOUT POP CULTURE.
THE TIRED STEREOTYPES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY I JEST.
THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES FORTHE TWO LEADERS TO DISCUSS,
AS WE LEARNED IN THISINTERVIEW ON FACE THE NATION.

AGAIN THERE'S BEEN SOMEOTHER THINGS THROWN AROUND

I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.
CALL ME BRO, BROSEPHUS.
I JUST LOVE HIS ACCENT, YOUKNOW.
YOU KNOW, IT IS NICE, YOUKNOW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO THERE? OF COURSE THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN RETICENT
TO USE CERTAIN WORDS TO DESCRIBETHE CAUSE OF OUR CURRENT
SECURITY ISSUE. YOU REMEMBERTHAT.
>> OTHERS OF YOUR ALLIESHAVE DESCRIBED THE IDEOLOGY
THAT YOU CALL A WARPED VIEW OFISLAM BY CALLING IT
RADICAL ISLAM.
>> THESE ARE INDIVIDUALSWHO CARRIED OUT AN ACT OF
TERRORISM AND THEY LATER TRIEDTO JUSTIFY THAT ACT OF
TERRORISM BY INVOKING THERELIGION OF ISLAM.
>> Jon: WELL, LATER THEY DIDTRY AND -- BUT ALSO BEFORE.
AND DURING.
COME ON, PRESS SECRETARYJOSH EARNEST, IF THAT IS HOW
THE BRASH -- THAT'S JOHN ERNEST.SO DESCRIBING HIS MANNER.
IF THAT IS HOW THE BRASH COWBOY
SHOOT THEM UP AMERICANS AREDESCRIBING THESE TERRORISTS,
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOWTIPTOY THIS IS GOING TO SOUND
COMING FROM OLD DOWNTONABBEY CAMERON.
>> IT MEANS COUNTERINGTHIS POISONOUS FANATICAL
DEATH CULT OF A NARRATIVE
THAT IS PERVERTING THERELIGION OF ISLAM.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: OKAY.
I GUESS THAT REALLY SHOWSTHE IMPOTENCE OF
BEING ERNEST, ANYBODY?
ANYBODY?
IS THAT -->> I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY HER
MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT TOTHANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THANK YOU.
SO PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD ASUCCESSFUL BRO-TIME HANGOUT
WITH THE BRITISH PRIMEMINISTER.
BUT HOW ARE WE MAKING UP FORLAST WEEK'S NO-SHOW ON THE
CHAMPS-ELYSEES.
>> SECRETARY OF STATE JOHNKERRY IS ON A CHARM
OFFENSIVE THIS MORNING INPARIS.
>> Jon: NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU ARETHINKING.
IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO SEND AMAN WHO APPEARS TO BE A LOVE
CHILD OF ANDREW JACKSON ANDA WOODEN CIGAR STORE
INDIAN-- (LAUGHTER)
ON A CHARM OFFENSIVE.
(LAUGHTER)IT IS A GOOD IDEA IF HE'S
GOING TO FRANCE.
>> JOHN KERRY SPEAKS FRENCH,LOVES FRANCE, STUDIED IN
FRANCE.
>> Jon: FAVORITE TYPE OFFRIES? FRENCH!
FAVORITE TYPE OF BULL DOG,FRENCH.
FAVORITE KIND OF MAID,FRENCH.
FAVORITE MUSTARD?
HEINZ.
COME ON, HE'S NOT GOING TOJEOPARDIZE HIS MARRIAGE OVER
MUSTARD.
(APPLAUSE)I WILL TELL YOU THIS, THOUGH,
LATE AT NIGHT, LATE AT NIGHTWHEN JOHN KERRY'S WIFE
TERESA HEINZ KERRY IS SLEEPING,
WHAT CONDIMENT DOES THESECRETARY SECRETLY RETRIEVE
FROM THE HIDING SPACE BEHINDTHAT LOOSE TILE UNDER THE
TOILET TANK -- WINK.
DON'T YOU SEE, THIS IS ABRILLIANT MOVE.
KERRY'S GENERAL FRENCHINESS,THE THING THAT LOST HIM OUR
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ISWHAT MAKES HIM OUR PERFECT
ENVOY.  ALL RIGHT, HERE HECOMES,
HERE IS HE MEETING FRENCHPRESIDENT HOLLANDE, AND
HE'S GOING, NO, I DON'T THINKHE WANTS -- NO, NO, I DON'T
THINK -- HE DOESN'T WANT TOTOUCH -- PULL OUT.
NO!
HE'S NOT WANTING THAT.
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO CHECK OUTTHAT HUG, UTILIZING NFL'S
REPLAY TECHNOLOGY.
BECAUSE HOLLANDE'S FACE IS OFA FRENCHMAN NOT BEING HEALED
BUT BEING FORCED TO EAT HISFIRST VELVEETA
WONDERBREAD SANDWICH.
LET'S SEE, ALL RIGHT,HE'S WALKING IN. THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT, KERRY'S GOING IN. NOWTHE FRENCH PRESIDENT
GOES WITH THE OPRAH HANDS. IT'STHE OPRAH HANDS.
I JUST WANT TO TOUCH HANDS,I JUST WANT TO TOUCH HANDS,
THIS IS THE DISTANCE.
KEEP IT AT THIS DISTANCE BUTKERRY SAYS [BLEEP] THAT,
COME ON, BABY, BRING IT IN,WE'RE BROS.
COUPLE OF CASUAL DUDES.
NOW, THE FRENCH PRESIDENTSAID OKAY, I'VE HAD ENOUGH
AND -- NO, HE'S LIKE ALL RIGHT,I'M DONE.
I'M DONE.
HOLLANDE TRIES TO GET OUTBUT WATCH KERRY, HE SAYS I'M
GONNA TELL YOU WHAT THOUGH, I AMNEVER LETTING YOU GO.
I AM NEVER -- LOOK ATHOLLANDE, HE'S LOOKING AT HIM.
HOLLANDE SAYS -- I'M VERY -- NO.THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED, BUT
UH! THAT IS NOT PROM WORTHY.LOOK AT THE --
LOOK AT KERRY LOOKING ATHIM LIKE HUH?
AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT ISLIKE -- ALL RIGHT.
SO PHASE ONE DID NOTNECESSARILY GO OFF ACCORDING
TO PLAN.
BUT CERTAINLY PHASE TWO WILLWIN FRENCH HEARTS AND MINDS.
>> SECRETARY KERRY BROUGHTJAMES TAYLOR TO PERFORM
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND FOR THEPEOPLE OF FRANCE TO HELP
EASE TENSION.
>> ♪ YOU'VE GOT AFRIEND ♪
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ARE YOU TRYING TOGET US IN A WAR?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
JAMES TAYLOR SINGING "YOU'VEGOT A FRIEND", A LITTLE ON
THE NOSE, DON'T YOU THINK?
FOR GOD'S SAKES, KERRY, YOUCOULDN'T FLY THE REMBRANDTS
OVER TO DO THE FRIENDS THEMEOR -- MAYBE HAVE THEM JUST
COME IN -- DOTHE SCHWIMMER.
OR MAYBE THE ZACK ATTACK.
OH DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'TKNOW THE ZACK ATTACK.
