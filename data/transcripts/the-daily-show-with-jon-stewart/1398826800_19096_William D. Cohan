>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT BEST SELLINGAUTHOR HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED
THE PRICE OF SILENCE.THE DUKE LACROSSE SCANDAL,
THE POWER OF THE ELITEAND THE CORRUPTION OF OUR GREAT
UNIVERSITIES. PLEASE WELCOMEBACK TO THE PROGRAM
WILLIAM COHAN, COME ONOUT HERE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
>> Jon: WE DON'T HAVE A TON OFTIME SO WE'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT
TO IT. WHAT DO YOUWANT DEAL WITH FIRST IN
THE PRICE OF SILENCE? THE DUKELACROSSE SCANDAL,
THE POWER OF THE ELITE OR THECORRUPTION OF OUR GREAT
UNIVERSITIES?
>> WELL, I MEAN THEY ALL GOTOGETHER.
THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BOOK ISTHAT THEY DO ALL GO TOGETHER IN
WAYS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE MAY NOTHAVE ANTICIPATED WHEN WE SEND
OUR KIDS OFF TO COLLEGE THINKINGTHEY ARE GOING TO GET A GREAT
EDUCATION.
>> Jon: IS THAT THOUGH JUSTREFLECTIVE OF THAT DIVIDE IN
SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
THIS IDEA DUKE IS, YOU KNOW,SORT OF AN ENCLAVE OF MORE
WEALTH AND MORE PRIVILEGETHAN IT'S SURROUNDINGING TOWN.
IS IT A MICROCOSM THOUGH OF ALARGER ISSUE IN THE COUNTRY?
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT NCAADIVISION I ATHLETES ARE PUT ON A
PEDESTAL IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'REDEALING IN REALTIME.
WE HAVE THE NORTHWESTERNUNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM THAT IS
THINKING ABOUT UNIONIZING ANDINCREDIBLY SOME OF THE ALUMNI
ARE SAYING MAYBE YOU DON'TWANT TO DO.
YOU'VE GOT THE JAMEISWINSTON STORY AT FLORIDA STATE.
YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT THATINVESTIGATION WAS BOTCHED OR
NOT.
THERE'S INCIDENTS AT VANDERBILTAND THE NAVAL ACADEMY.
THESE ARE HAPPENING ALL AROUNDTHE COUNTRY.
>> Jon: AREN'T THEY ALSOHAPPENING OUTSIDE -- WE
CERTAINLY JUST CAN'T ASSUMETHAT SEXUAL ASSAULT OR IN THIS
CASE THEY WERE EXONERATED BUTTHAT THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES
ARE SOMEHOW RELEGATED TOTHE UNIVERSITIES.
IT'S A PROBLEM IN SOCIETY.
>> AS MOST PROBLEMS ARE. I MEAN,
UNIVERSITIES ARE MERELY AMICROCOSM, IF I MAY USE THAT
WORD.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> OF LARGER  ISSUES IN SOCIETY.
WHY THIS BECAME SUCH AN AMAZINGSTORY.
I MEAN REALLY IT'S UNPRECEDENTEDIN ITS SCALE AND THE MEDIA
ATTENTION IT FOCUSED.
THESE KIDS JUST THOUGHT WE'LLHAVE A PARTY WHERE WE'LL JUST
DRINK ALL DAY. THEREMIGHT BE UNDERAGE DRINKING
GOING ON AND THEN WE'LL HAVE AGREAT IDEA
OF INVITING STRIPPERS TO COME TOOUR HOUSE INSTEAD OF GOING TO A
STRIP CLUB WHICH WE USUALLY DOAND NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEIR
WHOLE LIVES ARE UPSET FORCERTAINLY THE NEXT 15
MONTHS OF THIS SITUATION BEFORETHEY WERE
DECLARED INNOCENT BY THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATEOF NORTH CAROLINA BUT THEIR
LIVES ARE AFFECTED FORTHE REST OF LIVES.
>> Jon: IT'S SO TAILOR MADEFOR WHAT OUR MEDIA ENJOYS MORE
THAN ANYTHING WHICH ISSENSATIONALIZED CONFLICT.
WHITE KIDS RICHER KIDS AT APRIVILEGED UNIVERSITY, A WOMAN
OF LESSER PRIVILEGE.
THIS IS THE PERFECT STORM FORTHEM IN TERMS OF GENERATING
SOMETHING.
UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T WORK OUTFOR THEM IN THAT SHE WAS NOT A
PARTICULARLY GOOD EXEMPLAR OFDAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.
>> NOBODY COVERED THEMSELVESWITH ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE
GLORY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.THERE WERE NO HEROES HERE.
BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY OFTHE WAY JUSTICE CAN BE
SUBVERTED. BECAUSE THERE WASNEVER A TRIAL HERE.
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT,ELIZABETH WARREN WAS TALKING
ABOUT THIS THE OTHER NIGHT ONYOUR SHOW, ABOUT HOW MONEY AND
POWER CONTROL WASHINGTON.
WE KNOW BECAUSE I WROTE THE BOOKABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS THAT
MONEY AND POWER CONTROLWALL STREET.
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, OR MAYBENOT FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT A
CLEAR EXAMPLE OF HOW MONEY ANDPOWER CAN OFTEN SUBVERT
JUSTICE. BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTRIAL HERE.
>> Jon: BUT IS THIS A GOOD CASEOF THAT?
I WOULD AGREE WITH THATCERTAINLY MONEY AND POWER CAN
SUBVERT JUSTICE. AND WE HAVEATWO TIER SYSTEM.
AND YOUNG MINORITIES GOES TOJAIL FAR MORE FREQUENTLY AND FOR
FAR LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD.
BUT IS THIS THE BEST EXAMPLE OFTHAT PARTICULAR CORROSION IN OUR
SOCIETY?
>> IT MAY BE ONE OF FEW EXAMPLESOF THAT PARTICULAR CORROSION IN
OUR SOCIETY. BECAUSE DON'TFORGET WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
THREE KIDS WERE INDICTED.
THE WOMAN WHO ACCUSED THEM OFRAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT SHE
PROVED TO BE A LESS THANRELIABLE WITNESS. THE DISTRICT
ATTORNEY, HOWEVER, BELIEVED HER,BELIEVED THE NURSE
THAT EXAMINED HER AND BELIEVEDTHE POLICE THAT INVESTIGATED.
THERE WAS NEVER A TRIAL.
HE WAS BROUGHT UP ON CHARGESBEFORE THE STATE BAR.
HE WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO BRINGTHIS CASE TO TRIAL BECAUSE THE
DEFENSE WHO DID AN INCREDIBLEJOB, THEY WERE ABLE TO EXPLOIT
EVERY ONE OF HIS MISTAKES OFWHICH THERE WERE MANY.
THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE JUSTICESYSTEM WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK.
>> Jon: BUT, THAT'S MY POINT. IFHE WERE,
IF HE HAD NOT MADE SO MANYMISTAKES.
IF SHE WAS A MORE CREDIBLEWITNESS.
IF THERE WAS PHYSICAL EVIDENCETHAT MATCHED HER STORY AND THEN
THEY GOT OFF BASED ON ASUBVERSION OF JUSTICE BY A
POWERFUL DEFENSE TEAM, I THINKYOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ONE OF
THOSE MATTHEW McCONAUGHEYAT THE END LIKE
NOW IMAGINE SHE'S BLACK. YOUKNOW, THAT KIND OF ENDING.
THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO BETHAT CASE.
I DON'T WANT TO RELITIGATE IT.
>> NO, AND I DON'T WANT TOEITHER.
BUT IT'S NOT ASSIMPLE AS YOU SAY.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT'S GENERALLYMY POINT.
>> I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY 600PAGES, I MEAN.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
>> THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THEDEFENSE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT RAISES QUESTIONSABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT
BATHROOM.
I MEAN CLEARLY THERE WAS NOT ARAPE BECAUSE THAT RAPE CHARGED
WAS DROPPED BUT SOMETHINGHAPPENED IN THAT BATHROOM TO
MAKE CRYSTAL MANGUM THEVICTIM SLASH AS SHE'S
KNOWN NOW AS THE ACCUSER HAVETHIS POST TRAUMATIC
STRESS INCIDENT WHERE SHETHOUGHT THAT THIS HAPPENED TO
HER. AND, THERE WAS DNA EVIDENCEON FINGER NAILS THAT DEFENSE
DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.
>> Jon: RIGHT, WELL, I GUESS THEPOINT IS GIVEN THE STORY THAT
SHE TOLD, THE EVIDENCE DIDN'TMATCH THAT.
IT MATCHED MAYBE SOMETHING BUTNOT THAT.
>> IT DEFINITELY DID NOT MATCHWHAT SHE FIRST SAID THERE'S NO
QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
>> Jon: WELL LET'S TALKABOUT BECAUSE WHAT I THINK IS
MORE INTERESTING IS PERHAPSTHE LARGER POINT OF THESE
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS TRYING TOBALANCE EDUCATION AND THE
FINANCIAL ASPECT OF SPORT ANDALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR ALITTLE BIT?
>> IF YOU'RE NICE.
>> Jon: SURE, WHY NOT. STICKAROUND.
PRICE OF SILENCE IS ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
WILLIAM COHAN, EVERYBODY.
