( CHEERS AND  APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME "THE DAILYSHOW."
I'M JON STEWART.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE-- WE HAVE A VERY GOOD SHOWTONIGHT. VERY, VERY GOOD SHOW
TONIGHT BECAUSE OF OUR GUEST.
WE ARE VISITED TODAY FORTUNATELYBY MALALA YOUSAFZAI, WHO IS ONE
OF OUR FAVORITES.
SHE A YOUNG WOMAN FROMPAKISTAN--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHO IS A NOBEL PEACE PRIZERECIPIENT, WHICH I THINK IS
APROPOS FOR TODAY.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO-- I HAVE-- IHAVE ONE JOB, AND IT'S A PRETTY
SIMPLE JOB.
I COME IN, IN THE MORNING, ANDWE LOOK AT THE NEWS, AND I WRITE
JOKES ABOUT IT.
AND THEN I MAKE A COUPLE OFFACES, AND-- LIKE A-- LIKE A
NOISE LIKE A "RER."
AND THEN IT'S JUST CHA-CHING ANDI'M OUT THE DOOR.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I DIDN'T DO MY JOB TODAY SOI APOLOGIZE.
I GOT NOTHING ARE YOU IN TERMSOF LIKE JOKES AND SOUNDS BECAUSE
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SOUTHCAROLINA.
AND MAYBE IF I WASN'T NEARINGTHE END OF THE RUN OR THIS
WASN'T SUCH A COMMON OCCURRENCE,MAYBE I COULD HAVE PULLED OUT OF
THE SPIRAL, BUT I DIDN'T.
AND SO I HONESTLY HAVE NOTHINGOTHER THAN JUST SADNESS ONCE
AGAIN THAT WE HAVE TO PEER INTOTHE ABYSS OF THE DEPRAVED
VIOLENCE THAT WE DO TO EACHOTHER AND THE NEXUS OF A JUST
GAPING RACIAL WOUND THAT WILLNOT HEAL, YET WE PRETEND DOESN'T
EXIST.
AND I'M CONFIDENT, THOUGH, THATBY ACKNOWLEDGING IT, BY STARING
INTO THAT AND SEEING IT FOR WHATIT IS, WE STILL WON'T DO JACK
( BLEEP ).
YEAH.
THAT'S US.
AND THAT'S THE PART THAT BLOWSMY MIND.
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THEPOLITICAL ARGUMENT OF THE GUNS
AND THINGS-- WHAT-- WHAT BLOWSMY MIND IS THE DISPARITY OF
RESPONSE BETWEEN WHEN WE THINKPEOPLE THAT ARE FOREIGN ARE
GOING TO KILL US AND US KILLINGOURSELVES.
IF THIS HAD BEEN WHAT WE THOUGHTWAS ISLAMIC TERRORISM, IT WOULD
FIT INTO OUR-- WE INVADED TWOCOUNTRIES AND SPENT TRILLIONS
OF DOLLARS AND THOUSANDS OFAMERICAN LIVES AND FLY
UNMANNED DEATH MACHINES OVERFIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT COUNTRIES,
ALL TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE.
WE GOT TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN--WE'LL TORTURE PEOPLE.
WE GOTTA DO WHATEVER WE CAN TOKEEP AMERICANS SAFE.
NINE PEOPLE SHOT IN THE CHURCH.
WHAT ABOUT THAT?
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
CRAZY IS AS CRAZY, SRIGHT?
THAT'S THE PART THAT I CANNOT,FOR THE LIFE OF ME, WRAP MY HEAD
AROUND, AND YOU KNOW IT.
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO GODOWN THE SAME PATH-- THIS IS A
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY-- THEY'REALREADY USING THE NUANCED
LANGUAGE OF LACK OF EFFORT FORTHIS.
THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK.
THIS IS A VIOLENT ATTACK ON THEEMANUEL CHURCH IN SOUTH
CAROLINA, WHICH IS A SYMBOL FORTHE BLACK COMMUNITY.
IT HAS STOOD IN THAT PART OFCHARLESTON FOR 100 AND SOME
YEARS AND HAS BEEN ATTACKEDVICIOUSLY MANY TIMES, AS MANY
BLACK CHURCHES HAVE.
AND TO PRETEND THAT-- I HEARDSOMEONE ON THE NEWS SAY
"TRAGEDY HAS VISITED THISCHURCH."
THIS WASN'T A TORNADO.
THIS WAS A RACIST.
THIS WAS A GUY WITH A RHODESIABADGE ON HIS SWEATER.
YOU KNOW, SO THE IDEA THAT-- YOUKNOW, I HATE TO EVEN USE THIS
PUN, BUT THIS ONE IS BLACK ANDWHITE.
THERE'S NO NUANCE HERE.
( APPLAUSE )
THIS IS-- AND WE'RE GOING TOKEEPPRETENDING LIKE, "I DON'T GET
IT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
THIS ONE GUY LOST HIS MIND."
BUT WE ARE STEEPED IN THATCULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE
REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE IT, AND ICANNOT BELIEVE HOW HARD PEOPLE
ARE WORKING TO DISCOUNT IT.
IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THE ROADSTHAT BLACK PEOPLE DRIVE ON ARE
NAMED FOR CONFEDERATE GENERALSWHO FOUGHT TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE
FROM BEING ABLE TO DRIVE FREELYON THAT ROAD.
THAT'S-- THAT'S INSANITY.
THAT'S RACIAL WALLPAPER.
THAT'S-- YOU CAN'T ALLOW THAT,YOU KNOW.
NINE PEOPLE WERE SHOT IN A BLACKCHURCH BY A WHITE GUY WHO HATED
THEM, WHO WANTED TO START SOMEKIND OF CIVIL WAR.
THE CONFEDERATE FLAG FLIES OVERSOUTH CAROLINA, AND THE ROADS
ARE NAMED FOR CONFEDERATEGENERALS, AND THE WHITE GUY'S
THE ONE WHO FEELS LIKE HISCOUNTRY IS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM
HIM.
WE'RE BRINGING IT ON OURSELVES.
AND THAT'S THE THING.
AL QAEDA, ALL THOSE GUYS, ISIS,THEY'RE NOT ( BLEEP ) COMPARED
TO THE DAMAGE THAT WE CANAPPARENTLY DO TO OURSELVES ON A
REGULAR BASIS.
SO OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS ANINCREDIBLE PERSON WHO SUFFERED
UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE BYEXTREMISTS, AND HER PERSEVERANCE
AND DETERMINATION THROUGH THATTO CONTINUE ON IS AN INCREDIBLE
INSPIRATION, AND TO BE QUITEHONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLDI WOULD RATHER TALK TO TONIGHT
THAN MALALA.
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TODO.
AND SORRY ABOUT NO JOKES.
( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
