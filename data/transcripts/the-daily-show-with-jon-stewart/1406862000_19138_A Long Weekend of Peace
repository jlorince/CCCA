WE HAVE A VERY NICE SHOWTONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUBREY PLAZAFROM THE MOVIE "LIFE AFTER
BETH," BUT FIRST, I DON'T EVENKNOW HOW TO TELL YOU, FOLKS,
WHERE TO BEGIN TONIGHT.
THE MIDDLE EAST, YOU DON'T HEARA LOT ABOUT IT THESE DAYS.
[LAUGHTER]BUT RIGHT BEFORE WE STARTED THE
TAPING, ISRAEL AND HAMAS HAVEAPPARENTLY AGREED TO A 72-HOUR
CEASEFIRE, A 72-HOUR CEASEFIRE.
IT'S VERY NICE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]IT'S THREE DAYS. LET ME TELL
YOU, HERE'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR,A THREE-DAY CEASEFIRE SOMEHOW
MIRACULOUSLY TURNS INTO ANEIGHT-DAY CEASEFIRE AND SUDDENLY
WE GOT OURSELVES ANOTHERHANUKKAH WORKING, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING? A WHOLEOTHER MIRACLE.
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING ALOT OF US HAVE BEEN HOPING FOR.
>> WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORTDIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO END THE
VIOLENCE BETWEEN ISRAEL ANDHAMAS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT HISPRESIDENCY BEHIND THE EFFORTS TO
TRY FIND PEACE IN THE REGION.
>> Jon: AND NOW WE GOT THREEDAYS OF IT.
[LAUGHTER]A LONG WEEKEND OF PEACE.
IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO REALLYKNOW WHAT BROUGHT THIS ABOUT,
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE BREAKCAME AFTER THIS:
>> ISRAEL HAS MADE A REQUEST FORRESUPPLY OF SEVERAL TYPES OF
AMMUNITION.
AS ONE DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAID TOME, THEY HAVE BEEN USING UP AN
AWFUL LOT.
>> Jon: THAT IS, OF COURSE, THECORRESPONDENT FROM THE
UNDERSTATEMENT TIMES PICAYUNE.
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
THEY'RE JUST RUNNING OUT OF[BLEEPED] TO BLOW UP.
MAYBE WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THEDIPLOMATS TACKLED ISRAEL WHILE
THEY WERE RELOADING.
IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACETHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ASWE HEARD EARLIER HAS BEEN
WORKING TIRELESSLY TOWARDS.
NOW IS OUR CHANCE.
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS AGREEDTO RESUPPLY ISRAEL'S MILITARY
WITH MULTIPLE TYPES OFAMMUNITION.
>> 120 MILLIMETER MORTARS ANDGRENADES, FOUR GRENADE
LAUNCHERS.
>> Jon: WE HAD THIS.
WHY ARE WE GIVING THEM MORE WITHTHE BLOWING...?
LET'S END THE FIGHTING, BUTFIRST, HAVE SOME MORE FIGHTING
STUFF.
NO!

DEALER.
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
JUST SAY NO.
