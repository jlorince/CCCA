FFAFFA.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
ANY IDIOT CAN WRITE A LETTER.
SOME FRINGE GROUP.
WHO CARES?
>> HOME IMPROVEMENT CHAIN LOWE'S
IS FACING A BACKLASH AFTER
PULLING ADS FROM A REALITY
TELEVISION SHOW ABOUT AMERICAN
MUSLIMS.
>> LOWE'S PULLED A AD AFTER THE
FLORIDA FAMILY ASSOCIATION
COMPLAINED.
>> Jon: BUT HAVE YOU HEARD THE
COMPLAINT?
IT'S RIDICULOUS!
THE COMPLAINT IS THE MUSLIMS
AREN'T TERRORISTS AND ALL
MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS SO I
CAN'T BELIEVE I...
>> OUR DECISION WAS NOT
POLITICAL, IT WAS NOT SOCIAL IN
MY WAY.
WE JUST KNEW THAT IT WAS A
CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAM AND WE
WANTED TO REACH CONSUMERS AND A
CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAM IS NOT A
GREAT PLACE TO DO THAT.
>> Jon: YOU STILL ADVERTISE ON
THE LEARNING CHANNEL!
THE NETWORK WITH THE SHOW THAT
AIR BRUSHES FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRLS
LIKE THE SIDE OF A VAN IN JERSEY
AND SENDS THEM TO SASHAY OUT ON
THE STAGE LIKE THEY'RE IN A
VIDEO.
WHAT DO YOU... OH, FOR GOD'S...
FOR MORE, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR
MUSLIM CORRESPONDENT AASIF
MANDVI.
AASIF?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AASIF, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
AASIF, SOME GROUP IN FLORIDA
COMPLAINS THAT THE MUSLIMS ON
"ALL AMERICAN MUSLIMS" ARE TOO
NORMAL AND LOWE'S, THE HOME
IMPROVEMENT HARDWARE MEGASTORE
PULLS THE HARDWARE FROM THE
SHOW.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS?
>> I'M DISAPPOINTED, JON.
I ACTUALLY THINK LOWE'S SHOULD
BE SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY.
>> Jon: BUT YOU KNOW, AASIF,
CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT BECAUSE
THEY PULLED THEIR ADVERTISING...
>> WHAT?
NO, I'M SAYING IF WE'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT FIGHTING TERROR WE HAVE TO
SHUT DOWN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN,
I.E., LOWE'S...
(LAUGHTER).
A.K.A. THE ONE STOP JIHADI
SUPERSTORE.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK, JON, LET'S JUST CUT
THROUGH THE BULL (BLEEP) AND
AGREE THAT ALL MUSLIMS ARE
TERRORISTS.
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.
BENT ON WORLD DOMINATION BY
VIOLENT MEANS, RIGHT?
>> Jon: NO!
I'M NOT GOING TO... NO, I'M NOT
GOING TO AGREE WITH THAT.
THAT'S NOT...
>> THANK YOU.
AND WITHOUT THE STORE...
(LAUGHTER).
WITHOUT THE STORE LOWE'S, THE
JIHADISTS' GOAL IS UNACHIEVABLE,
JON.
IF YOU WERE A MUSLIM WHO WANTS
TO BUILD A BOMB... SORRY, I'M
OBVIOUSLY BEING REDUNDANT.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT WOULD YOU BUILD IT OUT OF?
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
BUILD BOMBS.
WIRING.
UM... P.V.C. PIPE, FERTILIZER.
>> YUP, OR AS THEY CALL IT HERE
AISLE 5.
(LAUGHTER)
JON, LOWE'S IS TO MUSLIM WHAT IS
F.A.O. SCHWARZ IS TO
NINE-YEAR-OLDS.
>> Jon: AASIF, ANY HARDWARE
STORE CARRIES FERTILIZER AND
LUMBER.
>> RIGHT!
BUT IT'S THE DEALS THEY OFFER!
BELIEVE ME!
WE ARE BUILDING A LOT FEWER
VICTORY MOSQUES BECAUSE WE CAN'T
GET LUMBER AT A DOLLAR A FOOT.
CHECK THIS OUT, LEISURE TIME
MONKEY BARS FOR $120?
AT THAT PRICE I'M TRAINING THE
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
I MEAN, COME ON!
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.
I GET IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TWO FOR ONE DEALS, 100-POUND
PROPANE CYLINDERS?
I MEAN, COME ON, YOU CAN'T
AFFORD NOT TO BLOW SOMETHING UP.
THEIR HELPFUL STAFF WILL EVEN
LOAD THE TANKS RIGHT INTO YOUR
CAR BOMB.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: YOU MEAN CAR.
THEY'LL LOAD THEM INTO YOUR CAR.
>> OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
CAR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BUT LOWE'S IS
PATRIOTIC.
VERY PATRIOTIC STORE.
THEY SELL AMERICAN FLAGS.
>> YEAH, SURE, TWO AISLES DOWN
FROM THE KEROSENE AND GRILL
LIGHTERS.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: YEAH, BUT AASIF I'M IN
THE MIDDLE OF REFRESHING MY
KITCHEN'S LOOK WITH A BACK
SPLASH.
IF LOWE'S SHUTS DOWN WHERE WILL
I GET CAULK?
>> WELL, WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE CAULK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THANK YOU, I DO.
I DO LOVE CAULK.
I MEAN, IT'S.
..
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, JON, I HOPE
YOU LOVE FREEDOM MORE.
>> Jon: MORE THAN CAULK?
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE I LOVE FREEDOM MORE!
>> Jon: .
>> THEN YOU MUST ADMIT THE
LOWE'S HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES
ARE DIRECTLY SUPPLYING AMERICA'S
ENEMIES WITH THE MEANS THEY NEED
TO BRING DOWN OUR COUNTRY FROM
WITHIN!
AT UNBELIEVABLY LOW PRICES!
(LAUGHTER)
AND IF THERE IS ONE THING
MUSLIMS LOVE MORE THAN TERROR
IT'S A BARGAIN.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M KIDDING.
THERE IS NOTHING MUSLIMS LOVE
MORE THAN TERROR.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: THANK YOU AASIF.
AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
