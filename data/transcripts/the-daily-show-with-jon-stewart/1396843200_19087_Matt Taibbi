>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A BEST SELLINGAUTHOR.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THEDIVIDE: AMERICAN INJUSTICE
IN THE AGE OF THE WEALTH GAP.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM MATT TAIBBI.
YOUNG MAN, COME AND SIT, ENJOY.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU FOUR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: THIS BOOK ISEXCELLENT.
IT'S FASCINATING TO ME.
>> IF YOU SAY SO.
>> Jon: HAVE YOU READ IT?
YOU SHOULD READ IT.
IT'S QUITE GOOD.
IT'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE ONIT.
YOU SHOULD READ IT.YOU KNOW,
WE TALK ABOUT THE WEALTH GAP ANDPEOPLE LOOK AT IF FROM A
TAXATION POINT OR AN INCOMEDISTRIBUTION POINT
YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT FROM ALEGAL SYSTEM ELEMENT WHICH IS
A SURPRISING DIRECTION TO TAKEON IT.
WHY THAT TAKE?
>> WELL, LOOK PEOPLE TALK ABOUTTHE INCOME INEQUALITY GAP ALL
THE TIME BUT FOR THE MOST PARTWHEN POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT IT'S
JUST A STATISTIC. BUT WHAT I'VEFOUND IS THAT THERE'S THIS
PROFOUND DIFFERENCE INTHE WAY WE PROSECUTE CRIME
FOR THE VERY WEALTHY, ANDPARTICULARLY THESE PEOPLE IN
THESE TOO BIG TOO FAIL EVILBANKS THAT WE ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT. AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE.
THERE'S THIS ENORMOUS DELTA ANDWE NEVER TALK ABOUT IT.
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO INTHIS BOOK IS JUST TALK ABOUT
THIS.
THIS REALLY GREW OUT OF MYEXPERIENCE COVERING FINANCIAL
CRIME FOR YEARS AND YEARS ANDYEARS.
WHEN I STARTED I DIDN'T KNOWANYTHING.
I COULDN'T EVEN BALANCE MY OWNCHECKBOOK.
>> Jon: NOT A CRIME.
>> NOT A CRIME, NO.
>> Jon: FROM WHAT IUNDERSTAND.
>> IT TOOK ME A WHILE TOUNDERSTAND.
I TRIED TO READ ALL THESE BOOKS,THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, ECONOMIC
TEXT BOOKS.
IT WASN'T UNTIL I READ LIKE ALITTLE THING THAT WAS LIKE THE
GREAT CONMEN IN HISTORYTHAT I -- IT DAWNED ON
ME IT'S JUST STEALING. THAT'SALL THIS IS. IT'S JUSTSTEALING.
>> Jon: THERE'S A CERTAINAMOUNT OF STEALING THAT APPEARS
TO BE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM ASAN ACCEPTABLE VIG FOR THE
GOOD THAT THEY DO, THE WEALTHTHAT THEY SPREAD.
>> BUT THERE IS NO -- AGAIN,THAT'S THE ILLUSION.
THERE'S NO GREATER GOOD.
THIS IS JUST TAKING STUFF FROMPEOPLE.
THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS ALLIT WAS WAS BANKS ROBBING OLD
LADIES.
IT WAS THE SAME THING.
YOU MIGHT HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE WHOCALL UP THE ELDERLY AND TRY TO
SELL THEM PHONY SUBSCRIPTIONSOVER THE TELEPHONE.
>> Jon: CORRECT.
>> THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE THINGWAS THE SAME THING.
PHONY MORTGAGES. THEY WERESELLING IT TO PENSION FUNDS AND
THEY WERE RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.
>> Jon: THIS GETS US TO THEGREAT PREMISE IN THE
BOOK WHICH IS, IF THE OLD LADY.
IF YOUR GRANDMOTHER WENT INTO ABANK AND RIPPED THEM OFF.
SAID GIVE ME YOUR MONEY AND THEYGAVE IT TO HER AND SHE WALKED
OUT CHANCES ARE THAT WOULDCARRY A CRIMINAL PENALTY?
>> ABSOLUTELY, YES.
>> FOR SOME REASON THE WHITECOLLAR RIPOFF HAS BEEN
DECRIMINALIZED TO SOMEEXTENT EXCEPT FOR FINES.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: AND NOT ON THEINDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT ON THE
LARGER CORPORATE LEVEL.
>> RIGHT, AND THIS IS WHAT I WASREALLY TRYING TO GET TO IN
THE BOOK. THERE'S THIS REALLYKIND OF SCARY PSYCHOLOGICAL
MOMENT THAT WE'VE CROSSED INAMERICA WHERE WE NO
LONGER THINK OF A CERTAIN KINDOF OFFENDER AS APPROPRIATE FOR
JAIL. I HAD THIS REALLYEYE-OPENING --
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: THAT'S SUCH A GREAT
PHRASE THIS MAN IS NOTAPPROPRIATE FOR JAIL.
>> I'VE HEARD THAT SAID TO MEHONESTLY.
I WAS TALKING TO A FEDERALPROSECUTOR A FEW YEARS AGO AND I
SAID LOOK THESE PEOPLE STOLE ABILLION DOLLARS.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS BANK.
HOW ARE THESE GUYS NOT JAIL? HOWDOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?
AND HE SAYS TO ME, HAVE YOU BEENTO A JAIL?
JAILS ARE DANGEROUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]PEOPLE GET STABBED IN JAIL.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I'M LIKE I'M NOT DISAGREEINGWITH YOU BUT THERE'S TWO
AND A HALF MILLION OTHERPEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO IN THAT
SAME PLACE AND THEY DID
A LOT LESS THAN STEAL A COUPLEOF BILLION DOLLARS, AND IT'S A
PSYCHOLOGICAL THING WHERE ITHINK MEMBERS OF A CERTAIN CLASS
JUST DO NOT SEE PEOPLEWHO RUN BANKS AND WHO
HAVE TIES AND DRIVE MASERATIS.
>> Jon: THESE ARE NOT BADPEOPLE.
THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO AREJUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
RULES THAT MAYBE THEY ALSOWROTE BUT STILL.
>> EXACTLY.
EXACTLY.
>> Jon: IT'S NOT SOMETHINGTHAT IS CRIMINAL.
BUT EVEN WHEN IT CLEARS INTO ANAREA THAT IS SO MORE CLEARLY
CRIMINAL.
I THINK THE HSBC CASE IS THEGREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS.
THEY ADMITTED TO LAUNDERINGMONEY FOR NARCO TERRORISTS.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
$850 MILLION.
>> Jon: AND THEY SAID, YES.
>> OH, YOU GOT US.
>> Jon: WE DID DO THAT.
>> WE DID DO THAT.
>> Jon: AND THEIR PENALTY WASWHAT?
>> THEY GOT A COMPLETE AND TOTALWALK. IT WAS A DEFERRED
PROSECUTION AGREEMENT. NOT ONEPERSON DID ONE DAY IN JAIL.
NO INDIVIDUAL TO HAD TO PAY ANYFINES.
THERE WAS A COMPANY FINE OF $1.9BILLION WHICH WAS AT THE TIME A
RECORD.
THAT VERY SAME DAY WHEN THEYMADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS VERYPROUD AFTER THIS DEAL.
IT WASN'T LIKE WE DIDN'T GET ANYJAIL TIME FOR THESE GUYS THEY
WERE LIKE WE GOT $1.9 BILLION.
AREN'T WE AWESOME?
I WENT DOWN TO THE COURTS THATDAY AND ASKED AROUND ASKING WHAT
IS THE DUMBEST DRUG CASE YOU'VEHAD TODAY?
THEY FOUND A GUY FOR ME THAT HADBEEN CAUGHT WALKING DOWN
THE STREET WITH A JOINT IN HIS
POCKET WHO GOT 47 DAYS ATRIKERS.
THAT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING THATHAPPENED TO ANYBODY AT HSBC AND
THEY ARE AT THE TOP OFTHE ILLEGAL DRUGS PYRAMID.
AND THIS GUY IS AT THE BOTTOMAND HE'S DOING A MUCH MORE
SEVERE SENTENCE. THAT JUSTCAN'T BE RIGHT.
THERE'S NO WAY TO LOOK AT THATAND HAVE THAT BE RIGHT.
>> Jon: NO AND WHAT I THOUGHT ISVERY INTERESTING ABOUT THE BOOK
IS YOU TIE -- THIS ISSYSTEMIC FROM THE TOP,
FROM THE HEAD LEGAL AUTHORITY INTHIS COUNTRY, ERIC
HOLDER AT THEDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
THIS IS NOT A BUG IN THE SYSTEMTHIS IS A FEATURE OF THE SYSTEM.
>> RIGHT, THIS IS A -- THAT'SEXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
ERIC HOLDER WAY BACK IN THECLINTON YEARS WHEN HE WAS JUST
A REGULAR JUSTICE DEPARTMENTOFFICIAL, HE WROTE THIS MEMO
AND IT'S COME TO BE KNOWN AS THEHOLDER MEMO.
HE OUTLINED THIS POLICY CALLEDTHE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES
POLICY. AND WHAT THAT BASICALLY MEANS IS
IF DEALING WITH A BIG COMPANYTHAT EMPLOYS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND
IF YOU PROSECUTE IT, BAD THINGSMIGHT HAPPEN TO INNOCENT PEOPLE.
YOU CAN SEEK OTHER REMEDIES, YOUCAN DO FINES, DEFERRED
PROSECUTION AGREEMENTS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRECK THEWHOLE THING IF GOING TO DO THAT.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THAT'S SENSIBLE. YOUDON'T WANT TO DESTROY A COMPANY
JUST BECAUSE A FEW BAD APPLES OFTHE COMPANY MAY HAVE
>> Jon: MAY HAVE LAUNDEREDNARCO TERRORIST MONEY.
EXACTLY.
>> YEAH IN THE CASE OF ENRONTHEY MAY HAVE SHREDDED TWO TONS
OF DOCUMENTS.
>> BUT, IT HAPPENS.
>> Jon: BUT IT HAPPENS  IT'S AMESSAGE ON THAT KID WITH THE
JOINT IN HIS POCKET IT SAYS TOHIM, GO BIG OR GO HOME.
>> RIGHT. RIGHT.
STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT.
THE DIVIDE IS ON THE BOOKSHELVESNOW.
WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE WITHMATT TAIBBI RIGHT AFTER THIS ON
THE INTERNETS, I THINK.
YES.
WE'LL DO IT.
