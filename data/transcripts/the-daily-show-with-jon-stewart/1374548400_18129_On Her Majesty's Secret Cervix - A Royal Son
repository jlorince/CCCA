>> John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
I AM JOHN OLIVER.
I AM STILL SITTING IN HERE FOR
JON STEWART.
WE ARE ALL MISSING JON TERRIBLY
HERE WHICH IS WHY WE WERE SO
GLAD THIS WEEKEND TO SEE HIM
TWEET A PICTURE OF HIMSELF.
OH, YEAH!
OH, YEAH!
AND IF YOU DON'T GET THE
REFERENCE FOR THAT PHOTOGRAPH,
THEN CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU LIVE IN A FAR HAPPIER WORLD
THAN THE REST OF US.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW
MOVIE BLUE JASMINE WILL BE HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A LOT TO
TALK ABOUT.
WHO AM I KIDDING.
THERE WAS EXACTLY ONE THING TO
TALK ABOUT.
>> HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE WAS SAFELY
DELIVERED OF A SON AT 4:24 P.M.
LOCAL TIME.
>> John: OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY
GOD, YES, YES, YES!
A SON, A SON, YOU MEAN A KING.
ALL NEAL TO THE ONE TRUE KING.
NEAL FOR GOD'S SAKE.
(TRUMPET FANFARE).
THIS BLESSED NEWS.
IT CAME AFTER A LONG DAY OF
AWAITING WORD FROM ST. MARY'S
HOSPITAL AS THE ROYAL LAD
SEEMINGLY PROLONGING LABOR,
PERHAPS SENSING THAT THIS WAS
THE ONLY KIND OF LABOR THAT HE
WOULD EVER BE INVOLVED IN.
WE WILL HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE
ON THIS TOMORROW NIGHT.
BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A
LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT CURRENTLY
IS OUT THERE.
>> THIS IS HOW BRILLIANT A ROYAL
KATE IS.
THERE ARE WOMEN THROUGHOUT
BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY HISTORY
THAT HAVE PANICKED OVER NOT
BEING ABLE TO DELIVER A BOY.
HERE WE ARE.
KATE DID IT FIRST TIME.
>> John: WHAT?
WHAT?
YOU ARE AWARE THAT SHE IS
MARRIED TO PRINCE WILLIAM AND
NOT CARL DROGO, AREN'T YOU?
WHAT WOULD YOUR RESPONSE HAVE
BEEN IF IT HAD BEEN A GIRL?
DAM NATION UPON YOUR CURSED
WOMAN.
SHE PRODUCED A BABY OF THE
WEAKER
