AT THE TIME THERE WAS REALCRACKDOWN GOING ON OF ALL

AND, THEY BASICALLY WANT TO SHUTDOWN ANY DISSENT AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT.>> Jon: MMHMM.

STILL OPERATING THERE.
THEY CAME THROUGH THE HOTELDOOR.
THEY CALLED US THE MARRIOTTCELL AND THEY ARRESTED THE
THREE GUYS IN THE MARRIOTT CELL,IN THE HOTEL.

TERRORIST PRISON CALLED THESCORPION'S UNIT BECAUSE --.
>> Jon: WHO'S NAMING THINGSIN EGYPT THESE DAYS, OUR C.I.A.?
[LAUGHTER]THE, UH, 200 DAYS.
NOW, THERE'S A BIG DEAL MADETHAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE
APPEALED TO EL-SISI, WHO IS NOWTHE PHARAOH THERE.
[LAUGHTER]AND, HE SAYS HE CAN'T DO
ANYTHING BECAUSE THE JUDICIARYIS A SEPARATE ENTITY FROM,
FROM... IT'S NOTUNDER HIS AUSPICES.
>> HE WAS VERY MUCH MAKING THEPOINT THAT IT'S AN INDEPENDENT
JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AND WE WERE ALLHOPING THAT WAS THE CASE.
WE HAD 12 SESSIONS OF A TRIAL,WHICH I WAS ON TRIAL AS WELL
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRIED INABSENTIA.
THERE WAS A NUMBER OF US THATEVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T
IN THE COUNTRY, WE WEREALSO ACCUSED OF HELPING
TERRORISTS, THEMUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
>> Jon: RIGHT. AND THESEGUYS ARE MERELY REPORTING SOME
NEGATIVE THINGS JUST OBJECTIVELYTHAT THE REGIME WOULD
FIND OBJECTIONABLE.
>> WELL, WERE WE REPORTINGNEGATIVE THINGS?
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SHOWANYTHING IN COURT THAT HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITHOUR REPORTING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE WAS, THERE WAS A HORSEGALLOPING IN A YARD...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> THAT THEY PULLED FROM
THE HARD DRIVE THAT THEY SHOWEDIN COURT.
THERE WAS FOOTAGE FROM DIFFERENTCOUNTRIES THAT SOME OF OUR
JOURNALISTS HAD DONE, BUTNOTHING TO DO WITH EGYPT.
>> Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OFTHE TRIAL WAS WHEN THE
PROSECUTOR SAID, I HAVE MOREHARD EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE
TERRORISTS, BUT I CANNOT SHOW ITBECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
DVD PLAYER.
[LAUGHTER]>> I MEAN, THAT WAS THE, THAT
WAS THE REAL TENET OF THE WHOLECASE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
WE WERE EXPECTING THEPROSECUTION TO COME UP WITH SOME
AMAZING EVIDENCE THAT WE WEREALL QUITE CONFUSED ABOUT...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED.
BUT EVEN STILL, WE WERE FOUNDGUILTY, AND I'VE BEEN SENTENCED
FOR TEN YEARS IN JAIL INABSENTIA.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE GUYS IN PRISON HAVE GOTBETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN YEARS IN
JAIL. THEY'RE GOING TO APPEAL,BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME
JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT PUT THEMTHERE.
>> Jon: SO, WHAT IS UNDERLYINGTHIS?
BECAUSE SOMETHING, SOMETHING ISGOING ON.
SO, WHAT IS IT THAT'SUNDERLYING THEIR IMPRISONMENT?
IT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT THEY'RESAYING IT IS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
>> THERE'S NO LOVE LOST BETWEENQATAR, WHICH IS WHERE AL JAZEERA
IS BASED, AND EGYPT AT THEMOMENT.
THERE IS A REAL TUSSLE GOINGON IN THAT WHOLE REGION.
>> NOW THERE WAS, THOUGH, WHENMORSI WAS IN POWER...
>> YEAH.>> Jon: THEY WERE ALLIED WITH
QATAR. >> INDEED.
AND THERE'S NO SECRET THAT QATARDID FUND THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
AND THAT THE PRESIDENT, WHEN HEWAS ELECTED, I MEAN, AFTER THE
REVOLUTION IN 2011, PRESIDENTMORSI WAS THE GUY THEY PUT
IN POWER. THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLESAID, WE WANT THIS GUY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED INTHE LAST TWO YEARS.
SO, YEAH, QATAR WAS VERY MUCHBACKING THEM, AND NOW,
OF COURSE, THEY'RE OUT, ANDTHE NEW GUYS ARE IN.
QATAR'S OUT.>> Jon: THE SAUDIS ARE IN NOW.
THE SAUDIS ARE THEONES NOW FUNDING EL-SISI...
>> THE SAUDIS ARE BACKING, YEP,YEP...
>> $24 BILLION. CAN THE SAUDISTHEN PUT SOME PRESSURE?
DOES INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, DOINTERNATIONAL NORMS MEAN
ANYTHING ANYMORE?
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE FURTHER WEGO INTO THESE CONFLICTS, THERE
IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FORBEHAVIORS OF GOVERNMENTS.
>> THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO ISPRAY THAT IT DOES MAKE
DIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: OK, THAT DOESN'T REALLYFILL ME WITH ANY TYPE OF HOPE.
>> NO, I KNOW.
>> Jon: TO BE HONEST WITHYOU, IN THAT SITUATION, YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH GOD YOU'REPRAYING TO TO GET THEM OUT.
>> I PRAY TO THEM ALL, JON. IPRAY TO THEM ALL.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. PRAY TO THEMALL.
>> NO, NO, I PRAY TO THEM ALL.
>> Jon: BUT, IS THERE ANYWHERETO APPEAL?
WHO'S GOT SWAY IN THIS?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THE AMERICANADMINISTRATION HAS GOT SWAY
BECAUSE THE EGYPTIANS AND THEAMERICANS HAVE BEEN GOOD
FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIMES.
AND YOU KNOW, STRATEGICALLY IT'SIMPORTANT THAT AMERICA IS
FRIENDS WITH EGYPT.
>> Jon: SO, YOU THINK WE COULDGET THEM OUT?
YOU'RE ADORABLE.
[LAUGHTER]NO WAY.
>> NO?
>> Jon: WE DON'T HAVE...
YOU KNOW, THAT'S BEEN THE ENTIRETHING IS AMERICA ALWAYS
BELIEVES WE CAN CONTROL ALLTHESE OUTCOMES, BUT
I THINK THE GAME HAS SLOWLYSLIPPED A LITTLE BIT.
CAN PEOPLE DO ANYTHING?
WOULD THAT MATTER?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S ACOUPLE THINGS.
WE'VE HAD THIS TWITTER CAMPAIGN,THIS FREE AJ STAFF CAMPAIGN
THAT HAS GONE GLOBAL, IT'STRENDING A LOT.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> SO, PEOPLE CAN TAKE A SELFIESOF THEMSELVES WITH TAPE OVER
THEIR MOUTHS AND HOLD THESIGN UP...
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.>> BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
HAVE A CONSCIENCE ABOUTWHERE YOU GO ON HOLIDAY.
YOU KNOW, SO MANY TIMES WHEN I'MIN EGYPT...
>> Jon: VOTE WITH YOURDOLLARS. I SEE.
>> YEAH, YOUR TOURISM DOLLARS.
I HEAR AMERICAN ACCENTS WHEN I'MOUT IN EGYPT.
MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE TIME TOGO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS AT THE
MOMENT.>> Jon: RIGHT. WHEN YOU
SEE AMERICAN ACCENTS DO YOU ALSOSEE BERMUDA SHORTS
AND VERY LARGE FLOWERYSHIRTS BY ANY CHANCE?
>> USUALLY, YES.
>> Jon: THAT BE US.
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
I TRULY HOPE THAT THESE THREEJOURNALISTS, THAT SANITY
PREVAILS, THAT THESE GUYS WILLBE RELEASED BACK TO THEIR
FAMILIES SOONER RATHER THANLATER.
KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT.
>> THANK YOU, SIR.
