>> THANK YOU, BOTH.
JESSICA AND AASIF MANDVI WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S NOT JUST THE CANDIDATES FEELING THE CLOCK WINDING DOWN.
TV PUNDITS ARE SCRAMBLING TO GET THEIR FINAL PREDICTIONS IN BEFORE TUESDAY
>> I THINK MITT ROMNEY WILL WIN OBAMA COULD WIN BIG THIS WILL BE A SQUEAKER
E PRESIDENT IS LIKELY TO WIN.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL EKE IT OUT BARELY
>> A SIZABLE ROMNEY VICTORY 277-303 NAIL BITER MINNESOTA TO GO FOR ROMNEY
OBAMA WINS ROMNEY BY 3% IT'S TOO CLOSE TO CALL.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL
>> Jon: IMPOSSIBLE?
[BLEEP] WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING THERE?
JUST OPEN YOUR MOUTH.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HERE'S NEWT GINGRICH.
REMEMBER HIM FROM THE PRIMARIES?
>> THE ODDS ARE VERY HIGH I'M GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE FOLLOWING THE ELECTION BUT HE WAS NOT THE NOMINEE.
THEY ENDED UP GOING WITH THE ROMNEY.
TRADEMARK BY THE WAY.
SO THAT GUY WAS WAY OFF.
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE THINKS, RIGHT?
BUT IT DOES
>> I BELIEVE THE MINIMUM RESULT WILL BE 53-47 ROMNEY, OVER 300 ELECTORAL VOTES AND THE
REPUBLICANS WILL PICK UP THE SENATE.
I BASE THAT ON JUST YEARS AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.
>> Jon: OF BEING WRONG.
SO OBVIOUSLY ON WEDNESDAY OR, GOD FORBID THURSDAY OR DECEMBER OR WHENEVER THIS THING IS
FIGURED OUT, WE'LL KNOW WHICH PUNNED IS WERE WRONG, WHICH WERE WRONGER AND WHICH WERE "OH, MY
GOD, THAT WAS REALLY WRONG." I CAN SHOW YOU A PREDICTION THAT'S WRONG TODAY.
IT COMES VIA DICK MORRIS, KING OF WRONG MOUNTAIN.
IT CONCERNS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PUNDITS
>> ROMNEY IS GOING TO WIN.
HE'S GOING TO WIN BY, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN FIVE POINTS.
I BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO GET MORE THAN 300 ELECTORAL VOTES.
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE ELECTION EITHER I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A BIG RECKONING OR THEY ARE.
>> Jon: NO, YOU WON'T AND THEY WON'T.
NOBODY WILL BECAUSE YOU'RE PUNDITS.
YOU LIVE IN A RECKONING-FREE ZONE.
ONE THING WE LEARNED IS THAT PUNDITRY IS LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IN PUNDITRY WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS, NOBODY EVER MOVES THE [BLEEP]
CHAIRS.
THEY JUST KEEP ADDING MORE CHAIRS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
