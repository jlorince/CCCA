TOO MUCH.
FOR ALL THE CONJECTURE THERE ARE
NOW A FEW THINGS WE DO KNOW FOR
SURE ABOUT TERROR SUSPECTS.
FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY AASIF
MANDVI LIVE IN BOSTON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: YOU'VE BEEN UP IN
BOSTON.
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS
STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE
SUSPECT SO FAR.
>> I CAN TELL YOU THIS, JON.
WHEN THEY FIRST RELEASED THOSE
PHOTOS, MUSLIMS ALL OVER AMERICA
SAID, "THANK GOD THEY ARE NOT
MUSLIM."
>> Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THEN ON... ON FRIDAY WE
FOUND OUT THEY WERE MUSLIMS.
>> YEAH BUT NOT MUSLIM-MUSLIM.
Jon: YOU MEAN BECAUSE THEY'RE
WHITE.
>> NOT JUST WHITE.
THE WHITEST OF WHITE.
I MEAN, THEY WERE LITERALLY FROM
CAULK ASIA.
>> Jon: OBVIOUSLY IN PEOPLE'S
EYES, IT CAN STILL LINK ISLAM TO
TERRORISM.
WHY DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THAT THEY'RE WHITE?
>> IT MEANS NO ONE WILL BE
YELLING AT ME ON THE STREET FOR
THE NEXT MONTH.
OKAY.
I MEAN, THEY'LL STILL SAY, HEY,
KUMAR, CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH?
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
NOW THE BIGOTS HAVE TO GET
CREATIVE.
GOOD LUCK COMING UP FOR SLURS
WITH CHECHENS.
GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM,
USHANKA-HEAD.
>> Jon: IS THAT A REAL THING OR
A SLUR YOU MADE UP.
>> IT'S THEIR DISTINCTIVE FUR
HAT, JON.
I HAD TO LOOK IT UP ON
WIKIPEDIA.
THAT'S HOW HARD IT IS GOING TO
BE.
>> Jon: I'M NOT SURE THAT COMING
UP WITH NO ETHNIC STEREOTYPES IS
REALLY THE MOST PRODUCTIVE USE
OF OUR TIME RIGHT NOW.
>> HAVE YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA,
JON?
I CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF
THIS MESS.
THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT THESE
GUYS THE HARDER IT IS TO GET A
HANDLE ON IT.
>> Jon: CHECHENS.
CHECHNYA MIGHT AS WELL BE A
SUBURB OF NARNIA.
FOR 12 YEARS AMERICANS HAVE BEEN
TOLD A NICE LITTLE STORY ABOUT
WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE AND WHAT
THEY LOOK LIKE.
AND THEN ALONG COME THESE TWO.
THE MUSLIM.
THEY'RE WHITE.
THEY'RE IMMIGRANTS BUT THEY'RE
AMERICANS.
THEY'RE ATHLETES.
DZHOKHAR IS A MONSTER YET KIND
OF A HOTTIE.
>> Jon: I GET THAT.
THEY'RE FROM THE SUBURBS YET
THEY LIKE THE HIP HOP.
>> I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ONE IS
DIFFICULT.
BUT THE POINT IS THERE'S TOO
MUCH GOING ON WITH THESE GUYS.
EVEN THE GUYS' NAMES.
DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV.
IT'S LIKE HE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE
EVERY LETTER OF THE AL A BET IN
THERE.
YOU CAN ANAGRAM TO SPELL
ANYTHING FROM OVERT HAZARD SHANK
TO ZACK EFRON SUCKS TO JELLO
PUDDING POPS.
CAN'T GET MORE AMERICAN THAN
THAT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon: YELLOW PUDDING POPS?
THE LAST FEW, AASIF, I'M PRETTY
SURE AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE WERE
NOT ACTUALLY ANAGRAMS.
>> I DO NOT KNOW HOW ANAGRAMS
WORK, JON.
>> Jon: AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT B
