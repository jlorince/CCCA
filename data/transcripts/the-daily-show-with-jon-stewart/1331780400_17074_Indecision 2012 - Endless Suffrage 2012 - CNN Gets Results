>> Jon: FOX NEWS, FAIR AND
COLICKY.
BUT AS ELECTION NIGHT BELONGED
TO CNN, THE MOST DESPERATE NAME
IN NEWS, WHICH ONCE GUN UNVEILED
AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON THE
SENSES, EMPLOYING THE FULL POWER
OF THEIR RAZZLE-DAZZLE-TRONS AND
REAL-TIME MAKE-UP TECHNOLOGY.
YOU THINK DAVID GERGEN WAKES UP
LOOKING LIKE THAT?
NO.
IT TAKES WORK, PEOPLE.
BUT FOR CNN, IT WAS ALL ABOUT
RESULTS.
>> RIGHT NOW CNN BALLOT CAMERAS
ARE STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED IN
ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI TO BRING
YOU THE RESULTS FROM THOSE
CONTESTS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.
>> WE'RE WATCHING THE NUMBERS
VERY, VERY CLOSELY.
>> NO ONE IS WATCHING THEM MORE
CLOSELY THAN OUR OWN JOHN KING.
>> WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL
RESULTS IN.
CNN IS GETTING THESE IN FRONT OF
THE OFFICIAL RESULTS.
WE HAVE THE MOST CREWS AND IN
THE MOST LOCATIONS INCLUDING OUR
CORRESPONDENTS COVERING THE
CAMPAIGN.
WE'LL BE WAY AHEAD OF ALL THE
OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS IN
SHARING THESE NUMBERS.
>> WE'LL HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS!
53, 28, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE, 17.
[LAUGHTER]
NO OTHER NETWORK COMES CLOSE.
WE HAVE SEVEN.
WHAT DO THEY HAVE?
HOW FAR WAS CNN WILLING TO GO TO
GET YOU PARTIAL MISSISSIPPI
DISTRICT VOTING NUMBERS A FULL
MINUTE BEFORE THE OTHER
NETWORKS?
PRETTY FAR.
>> MY GOOD FRIEND DANNY HERE,
DANNY GLASSCOX.
>> Jon: GO ON.
>> DANNY HERE WAS ABOUT TO PRINT
ME SOME EVEN FRESHER NUMBERS, AS
FRESH AS HE CAN GIVE THEM TO US.
DANNY, HOW ARE YOU COMING ALONG
IN TERMS OF... WE GOT A FRESH
REPORT COMING OUT NOW?
>> Jon: WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF
GLASCOX.
THE I GO'S WORKING.
STOP BREAKING HIS GLASS BALLS.
I TELL YOU SOMETHING, I RALLY
HOPE BREAKING THIS GUY'S GLASS
BALLS IS WORTH IT.
>> WOLF, IF WE STAND BY FOR JUST
A FEW SECOND, I CAN GIVE YOU
EVEN FRESHER NUMBERS THAN THAT.
HE'S PUTTING A TITLE ON THE
REPORT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE
UNDERSTANDS THESE ARE UNOFFICIAL
AND... OKAY.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU WHEN WE
GET FRESHER NUMBERS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I WANT TO REMIND
EVERYONE IT'S A CNN EXCLUSIVE ON
THE LACK OF FRESHER NUMBERS.
YOU WANT HEAR ABOUT THESE
UNOFFICIAL NON-EXISTENT NUMBERS
ANY PLACE ELSE.
HOW INSANE WAS CNN'S
ALL-INCLUSIVE WOLF CRYING WOLF
ABOUT THE FRESHNESS OF CNN'S
NUMBERS?
WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DECLARE THE
RACES, A.K.A. THE MATTERRERRING
THING, CNN WAS BEATING TO THE
PUNCH BY THE NETWORK THAT SMEAT
MOST OF THEIR NIGHT NOT COVERING
THE PRIMARIES.
IN FACT, IT WAS ONE MOMENT THAT
CRYSTALLIZED CNN'S COVERAGE.
IF YOU SAW RICK SANTORUM'S
PEACH, YOU MAY HAVE CAUGHT THE
MOMENT WHERE IN THE MIDST OF
CELEBRATING HIS ALABAMA WIN,
HE GETS SOME BREAKING NEWS OFF
STAGE THAT HE'S ALSO WON
MISSISSIPPI.
>> WE DID?
GREAT.
>> Jon: LOOK AT THAT.
A GENUINE HUMAN MOMENT.
YOU SELDOM GET TO SEE THAT KIND
OF EMOTION IN THE HEAT OF A
CAMPAIGN.
HE'S GENUINELY TOUCHED AND
FLUSTERED, AND HERE'S HOW CNN
FOLLOWED UP THE MOMENT.
>> SOME HAVE CALLED TO SAY
MISSISSIPPI FOR RICK SANTORUM.
WE HAVE NOT YET.
96% OF THE VOTE IN.
>> RIGHT NOW 96% OF THE VOTE IN
MISSISSIPPI.
WE HAVE NOT YET MADE A
PROJECTION, BUT IT'S LOOKING
VERY, VERY GOOD FOR RICK
SANTORUM.
>> JON: YOU BETTER MAKE A
PROJECTION, MISTER.
YOU'VE BEEN PESTERING YOUNG
MASTER GLASCOX ALL NIGHT LONG.
NOW YOU DECIDE TO GET CAUTIOUS?
THE CANDIDATE IS MAKING OUT WITH
HIS WIFE, FOR GOD'S SAKE
