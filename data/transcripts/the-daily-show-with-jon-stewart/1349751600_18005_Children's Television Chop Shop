AS YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE FACE A GROWING DEFICIT AND DEBT PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT MITT ROMNEY HAS VOWED TO FIX.
WHILE HE'S NOT SPECIFIC ABOUT THE MEASURES, THAT ALL CHANGED AT LAST WEEK'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
>> I'M SORRY, JIM, I'M GOING TO STOP THE SUBSIDY TO PBS.
I'M GOING TO STOP OTHER THINGS.
I LIKE PBS.
I LOVE BIG BIRD.
I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU TOO BUT I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP ON SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS TO BORROW MONEY FROM CHINA TO PAY FOR IT
>> Jon: PACK YOUR TOTE BAGS AND RIDE THE HIGH CULTURED TRAIN BACK TO CANCEL TOWN.
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR INVISIBLE ELEPHANT FRIEND WITH YOU, YOU EIGHT-FOOT TALL YELLOW FEATHERED FREAK.
WHO FIRES BIG BIRD?
LOOK, AFTER THE INITIAL ELATION OF GETTING A SPECIFIC... SETTLE DOWN.
AFTER GETTING A SPECIFIC FROM ONE OF MR. ROMNEY'S PLANS WHICH FELT VERY GOOD CAME THE REALIZATION THAT THIS MOVE TO

$4 BILLION AMOUNTS TO -- ARE YOU READY?
-- IT REPRESENTS 0008%.
$5 TRILLION, AND THIS PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED, FOR WHATEVER REASON, IS .0008% OF THE PROBLEM.
>> Jon: FORGETTING FOR JUST A SECOND THAT $4 BILLION IS NOT .0008% OF $5 TRILLION BUT IN FACT .05%, WHAT'S A COUPLE OF
ZEROS BETWEEN LEAD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS ON A BUSINESS NETWORK?
BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THE ARGUMENT WHICH APPEARS TO BE THAT $8 MILLION IS GREATER THAN $4 BILLION.
IN THE WORDS OF A CERTAIN MATHEMATICALLY INCLINED VAMPIRE, I BELIEVE THE QUOTE WOULD BE "THAT'S BULL
