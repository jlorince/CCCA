(LAUGHTER)
MOVING ON!
GOOD ON YA, FROM CRUSHING
SPIDERS TO CRUSHING DREAMS S
THIS REALLY THE SEGUE WE'RE
GOING GO WITH?
YOU KNOW, WE HEAR THIS ALL
THE TIME.
THE GOVERNMENT IS SO STUPID.
THE FREE MARKET SHOULD RUN
THE COUNTRY.
AYN RAND IS THE BEST AUTHOR
EVER, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL MY
SENIOR YEAR.
YOU KNOW.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT DID YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC
SECTOR HAS NO MONOPOLY ON
RUINING EVERYTHING?
>> BETWEEN 2009 AND 2010
FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS THAT
WERE WRONGFUL OR IN SOME WAY
CONTAINED BANKER ROHR
COMMENCED AGAINST NEARLY 4
MILLION HOMEOWNERS.
>> Jon: 4 MILLION, IT'S ONLY
2 MILLION HOMES A YEAR.
AND THIS IS THE PRIVATE
SECTOR DOING THIS I'M SURE
IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO TRACK
THE PAPERWORK OF THE
MORTGAGES AND CORRECT THE
ERRORS.
>> IT USED TO BE THAT THE
PAPERWORK TRACKING MORTGAGES
WAS EASY TO FIND, FILED AT A
LOCAL RECORDERS OFFICE.
>> Jon: AND REMAINS SO
TODAY.
HMMMM?
THAT IS YOUR STORY, IS IT
NOT?
SINCE THAT SYSTEM IS WORKING
AND PEOPLE WERE VERY HAPPY
WITH IT?
>> BUT MORE THAN A DECADE
AGO BIG MORTGAGE LENDERS SET
UP THEIR OWN ALTERNATIVE
SYSTEM.
IT'S CALLED MERSES, THE
MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC
REGISTRATION SYSTEM.
>> Jon: YOU'RE KIDDING ME!
SO THESE 4 MILLION
FORECLOSURE PROBLEMS, THIS
WAS NO ACCIDENT.
THIS WAS--
(LAUGHTER)
MERS.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT.
SO IT WAS MERS.
HOW DOES MERSES WORK.
>> INSTEAD OF FILING PAPERS
AT A LOCAL COURTHOUSE,
MORTGAGE CHANGES ARE SIMPLY
REGISTERED INSIDE THE MERS
COMPUTER.
BUT WITH NO OFFICIAL PAPER
TRAIL LENDERS ARE NOW
SCRAMBLING TO PRODUCE
DOCUMENTS TO PROVE THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT TO FORECLOSE.
>> Jon: AS IT TURNED OUT THE
BIG BANKS DIDN'T ENJOY
FILLING OUT PAPERWORK.
FOR EVERY SINGLE MORTGAGE.
THEY WANTED TO REASSIGN OR
SECURITY ADVERTISE SO THEY
FORMED A CONSORTIUM.
MORTGAGE DUMPSTER, IF YOU
WILL.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM
THESE MORTGAGES TO TRADE
ELECTRONICALLY WITHIN THIS
CORPORATION, THEY WERE ALL
SHAREHOLDERS OF.
THINK OF IT AS A TEA PARTY.
BUT INSTEAD OF [BLEEP] YOUR
WIFE, THEY LOSE TRACK OF THE
DEED TO YOUR HOUSE.
BUT FEAR NOT--
(APPLAUSE)
FEAR NOT.
FEAR NOT, MY SPIDERPHOBIC
FRIENDS.
I'M SURE THERE IS A BETTER
NAME FOR THAT BUT I DON'T
KNOW.
FEAR NOT, THIS TYPE OF
INEVITABLE FREE MARKET
OVERREACH IS WHY THE
GOVERNMENT MUST MAINTAIN ITS
WATCHDOG STATUS GO GET THEM
BOYS.
>> THE OFFICE OF THE
CONTROLLER OF CURRENCY THE
OCC --.
>> Jon: OH YEAH, YOU DOWN
WITH OCC, YEAH!
THE OFFICE OF THE CONTROLLER
OF THE CURRENCY.
BECAUSE THEY SPRUNG INTO
ACTION TO DETERMINE WHICH
HOMES WERE BEING FORECLOSED
UPON INAPPROPRIATELY.
>> INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE
REVIEW WAS ESSENTIALLY
HAVING BANKS HIRE
INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS WHO
WERE ON BANK PAYROLLS TO
LOOK AT THE BANK'S OWN
RECORDS.
>> Jon: WE ARE ALONE.
>> THE WHOLE THING WAS SO
BADLY CONCEIVED FROM THE
BEGINNING, AGAIN, THAT THE
OCC FINALLY SAID WE GIVE UP.
>> ABANDONED FOR BEING TOO
COMPLICATED AND FOR HELPING
ALMOST NO ONE.
>> Jon: WHICH IS
COINCIDENTALLY THE OCC'S
MOTTO.
(LAUGHTER)
SO ULTIMATELY--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: YOU DOWN WITH OCC.
SO ULTIMATELY LIKE MOST
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND
EXTREMELY DESTRUCTIVE
FINANCIAL SCANDALS, THE
PERPETRATORS WENT TO JAIL.
WENT TO JAIL!
I'M A CARD.
I AM A RIOT!
(LAUGHTER)
THEY PULL TRILLIONS OUT OF
THE ECONOMY AND THEY WENT TO
JAIL.
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS THEY
WENT TO THE CARIBBEAN.
(LAUGHTER)
THEY WENT TO THE CARIBBEAN
AFTER PAYING AN INADEQUATE
AND COMPLETELY ARBITRARY
SETTLEMENT OF $9 BILLION.
NO, SERIOUSLY.
THEY ADMITTED IT WAS
COMPLETELY ARBITRARY.
>> TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER
WOULD HAVE REQUIRED WITH
MORE PRECISION WOULD HAVE
REQUIRED ADDITIONAL DELAY IN
PROVIDING --
>> BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU
PICK A NUMBER OUT OF THE
AIR.
>> Jon: OH.
REALLY?
WHAT'S WRONG, SENATOR.
DON'T YOU LIKE MAGIC?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I'M SORRY THAT
ACTUALLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A NUMBER.
(LAUGHTER)
AND I HAVE TERRIBLE
ALLERGIES, SO-- BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT, $9 BILLION WAS THE
PERFECT NUMBER BECAUSE IT'S
A BIG ENOUGH NUMBER TO
IMPRESS CONSUMERS, BUT A
SMALL ENOUGH NUMBER TO TEACH
THE BANKS NO LESSON
WHATSOEVER.
AND IT IS INCREDIBLY
DIVIDABLE ENOUGH TO BE
MEANINGLESS.
>> OUR VIEWERS ARE LOOKING
AT A FULL SCREEN RIGHT HERE
ABOUT WHAT VICTIMS ARE GOING
TO GET.
>> NOT MUCH.
>> 60% AS YOU SAID WILL GET
$300 BUCKS.
>> Jon: WHOOO!
300 BUCKS.
WHICH IS GOOD IF THE HOME
YOU LOST IS ON THE 16th HOLE
OF A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT WITH ALL THAT, WITH
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED,
WITH FREE MARKET
INCOMPETENCE COUPLED BY
GOVERNMENT IRREGULARLATION,
THEY TOP IT ALL OFF WITH ONE
FINAL KICK TO THE HOMEOWNERS'
NUTS.
>> GOVERNMENT ISSUED CHECKS
TO HOMEOWNERS ARE BOUNCING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AH!
SO THAT'S WHY THIS GUY'S
PICTURE IS UP BEHIND THE
REGISTER AT THE BODEGA.
(LAUGHTER)
