>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM.
WE'RE TALKING TO PRESIDENTBILL CLINTON. WE'RE GOING TO
TALK ABOUT WITH THAT NEWECONOMIC POLICY COULD LOOK
LIKE.
BESIDES THE FACT, WHAT AREYOU NOW FIVE YEARS GOING IN
WHAT IS-- 5 YEARS NOW, THECLINTON GLOBAL INITATIVE.
HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEENDOING THAT?
>> THIS WILL BE THE 10thYEAR.
>> Jon: THE 10th YEAR.
AND YOU JUST HAD AN ECONOMICFORUM.
>> WE JUST HAD THE ONE FORAMERICA, WHICH WE'VE BEEN
HAVING SINCE 2011.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THIS NEWECONOMY?
YOU ARE DEALING WITH IT WITHTHE GLOBAL INITIATIVE.
HOW DO WE CHANGE-- AMERICAHASN'T ADJUSTED ITS ECONOMY.
>> I WILL GIVE YOU ANEXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT
JUST GREW OUT OF ACONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE
PRESIDENT OF THEA.F.L./C.I.O..
I SAID, I TOLD HIM, I SAIDLOOK, WE, AND WE LOST THE
CONGRESS IN 2010, OBAMA LOST THEHOUSE.
AND SAME THING HAPPENED TOME.
AND I SAID YOU NEED TO LOOKAT WHAT YOU CAN DO TO CREATE
JOBS.
YOU'VE GOT A PENSION FUND.
YOU HAVE A BOARD OFTRUSTEES.
THEY HAVE TO INVEST THEPENSION FUND IN A WAY THAT
GIVES YOU A RATE OF RETURNTO PAY YOUR RETIREES.
BUT YOU NEED SOME GOODSUCCESS, WHAT YOU REALLY
NEED IS SOMETHING THATOFFERS YOU A STEADY RETURN.
BEST THING YOU COULD DO TOCREATE JOBS FOR YOUR MEMBERS,
WHICH WILL PAY MORE MONEY IN THEPENSION FUND, IS INVEST IN
RETROFITTING BUILDINGS.
SO HER REFERRED ME TO THEBUILDING TRADES.
AND IRONICALLY TO THE AMERICANFEDERATION OF TEACHERS.
THEY MADE A COMMITMENT THATTHEY WOULD ORGANIZE TEN
BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OFINVESTMENTS IN BUILDING
RETROFITS.
NOW, I WAS ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'SCOUNCIL WITH ALL THESE BIG
BUSINESS PEOPLE.
THA'S MORE THAN THEY SPENT BYFAR THAT THEY DID PUT TOGETHER.
IN THE FIRST $5.6 BILLION, THEYCREATED 50,000 JOBS AND
TRAINED 900,000 PEOPLEAROUND AMERICA TO DO
THIS KIND OF WORK.
>> Jon: THESE ARE GOOD TRADEJOBS.
>> YES.
>> Jon: THESE ARE MIDDLE CLASSJOBS.
>> AND CAN'T SHIP THESE JOBSOVERSEAS BECAUSE THE
BUILDINGS ARE HERE.
THEY ARE BY DEFINITION.
SO NOW THEY HAVE COMMITTEDOVER 11 BILLION DOLLARS OF
IT.
AND I WILL GIVE YOU ONEEXAMPLE.
THEY CONTRACTED TO REDOLAGUARDIA AIRPORT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHICH NEEDS DOING ANDTHEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE --
>> Jon: MAN, DO THEY NEEDREDOING.
>> YEAH, BUT THEY'RE GOING TOLEAVE THE MARINE TERM UNTIL,
ALL THAT WONDERFUL ART DECOART ALONE, WHICH IS GOOD.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S ART.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
>> BUT ANYWAY, THAT ONECONTRACT WILL CREATE 15,000
JOBS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE'VE GOT EIGHT INDIANTRIBES, IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
WHO HAVE SET UP A POWERAUTHORITY AND THEY'RE
RAISING MONEY.
THEY PROMISE TO DO, RAISINGMONEY TO BUILD THEIR OWN
WIND FARMS AND TRANSMISSIONLINES.
AND TAKE THE MONEY THEY GETFROM EARNING THE POWER FIRST
TO PAY OFF THE INVESTMENTAND THEN SHARE IT AMONG
INDIANS THAT BY AND LARGELIVE ON RESERVATIONS WITH NO
GAMBLING, BECAUSE THEPOPULATION IS NOT DENSE
ENOUGH, AND ARE THE POORESTAMERICANS THERE IS.
SO WE WILL BE ABLE TODIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY.
THEN THEY CAN, IF THEY ALLHAD BROADBAND, JUST LIKE IF IN
EASTERN KENTUCKY AND WESTVIRGINIA, THEY ALL HAD
BROADBAND, WE COULD BRING AWHOLE NEW ECONOMY THERE.
BUT WE NEED TO DO THATEVERYWHERE.
AND I'M TELLING YOU, THEREARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN  RURAL
PARTS OF AMERICA THAT MAKE APERFECTLY GOOD LIVING IF
THEY COULD OPERATE MOREON-LINE AND THEY CAN'T DO IT
IN THE HORSE AND BUGGY AREAWHEN SOMEBODY IN SOUTH KOREA
CAN DO IT FASTER AND CHEAPER.
IT'S CRAZY FOR US TO LETTHIS BE DONE FASTER AND
CHEAPER.
THE INTERNET STARTED INAMERICA, FOR GOODNESS SAKES.
>> Jon: NO, AND IT'S ALLOBVIOUS.
BUT THE FEAR IS THATWE WILL NEVER RESPOND UNTIL
THE IMPLOSION ANDCATASTROPHE IS UPON US
BECAUSE THAT IS OUR MO.
OUR MO IS WE KNOW EXACTLYWHAT TO DO.
WE SEE THE TRAIN COMING ANDWE KEEP LOOKING AT IT GOING,
"THAT LOOKS PRETTY CLOSE, THATLOOKS PRETTY CLOSE."
AND THEN ONCE IT HAS RUN OVERUS, WE GO "YEAH, WE PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHINGABOUT THAT." THAT'S OUR
PROBLEM.
>> WELL, AS CHURCH HILL ONCESAID --
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU REMEMBER ANYOF THIS?
ANY OF THIS.
(APPLAUSE)
>> IN WORLD WAR II BEFOREAMERICA GOT IN, IT WAS
PRETTY BLEAK FOR BRITAIN.
AND THE PRESS TRIED TO ADDSOME LEVITY TO ONE OF HIS
PRESS CONFERENCES.
BY SAYING YOU ARE SUCH A BIGFAN OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT,
YOU SAY HE'S GREAT.
BUT WHERE ARE THEY? WE'RE OVERHERE GETTING OUR HEADS HANDED
TO US.
AND CHURCH HILL SAID THEAMERICAN PEOPLE, HE SAID THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICAALWAYS DOES THE RIGHT THING,
AFTER EXHAUSTING EVERY OTHERALTERNATIVE.
>> Jon: THERE WE GO.
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON
