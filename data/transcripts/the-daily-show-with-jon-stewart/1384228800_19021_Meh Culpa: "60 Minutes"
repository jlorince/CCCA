( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOUTONIGHT.
AUTHOR, HONORARY RED SOX, DORISKEARNS GOODWIN WILL BE JOINING
US.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT--( LAUGHTER )
I AM THE WORST SEGUE PERSON INTHE WORLD.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT!
( LAUGHTER )I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AN EYEON THE MEDIA IN OUR NEW SEGMENT
MEH CULPA.
ONE OF THE MOST HALLOWED NAMESIN ALL OF JOURNALISM IS "60
MINUTES," A SHOW THAT HAS FORWEEK AFTER WEEK FOR OVER 45
MINUTES BROUGHT US 58 MINUTES OFHARD-HITTING GROUNDBREAKING
INVESTIGATIONS INTO EVERYTHINGFROM CORPORATE GREED AND CORRUPT
GOVERNANCE, AND TWO MINUTES OFMUSINGS.
>> BOUGHT 1,000 HONEY DUE MELONSAND ONLY THREE OF THEM WERE RIPE
OVER THE YEARS.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  I THINK HE'D WANT
TO BE REMEMBERED AS SOMEBODY WHOWAS-- A GREAT WRITER--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE AUDIENCE
WAS TRAINED BEHAVIORABLY TOREACT TO SOMETHING THAT WE--
( LAUGHTER )ANYWAY THE MAN CLEARLY COULD
NOT PICK OUT GOOD PRODUCE.
MY POINT IS THIS-- LAST MONTH,IT LOOKED LIKE "60 MINUTES" HAD
DONE IT AGAIN, SCORING ANEXPLOSIVE INTERVIEW WITH AN
EYEWITNESS TO THE TERRIBLEEVENTS IN BENGHAZI.
>> ONE GUY SAW ME.
HE JUST SHOUTED.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE'DSEEN ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK.
HE STARTED WALKING TOWARDS ME,JUST HIT WITH THE BUTT OF THE
RIFLE IN THE FACE.
I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GLASS, IKNEW WHO IT WAS IMMEDIATELY
>> WHO WAS IT?
>> IT WAS THE AMBASSADOR, DEAD.
>> Jon:  IT WAS A CHILLINGDESCRIPTION OF LACK OF
PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTABILITYFOR ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST
VULNERABLE DIPLOMATIC OUTPOSTS.
THERE'S ONE SMALL PROBLEM.
IT'S TOTAL ( BLEEP ).
HE MADE THE WHOLE THING UP!
HAH!
BURN!
WHICH "60 MINUTES" SORT OFACKNOWLEDGED SUNDAY NIGHT.
>> DYLAN DAVIES TOLD US HE WENTTO THE COMPOUND DURING THE
ATTACK AND DETAILED HIS ROLETHAT NIGHT.
AFTER OUR REPORT AIRED,QUESTIONS AROSE ABOUT WHETHER
HIS ACCOUNT WAS TRUE.
>> Jon:  WE THOUGHT OFRAISING THE "IS THIS TRUE"
QUESTION BEFORE AIRING.
THESE EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS --BUT IT'S SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS!
( LAUGHTER )TO CHECK AND WHAT IF IT WAS
( BLEEP )?
AND THEN WE'VE GOT THESE 10MINUTES TO KILL.
AH, I DON'T KNOW!
THE BEST PART IS HOW "60MINUTES" FOUND OUT THE GUY WAS
LYING.
>> WE DISCOVEREDTHE ACCOUNT HE
GAVE THE F.B.I. WAS DIFFERENTTHAN WHAT HE TOLD US.
>> Jon:  WHAT!
( LAUGHTER )IF YOU CANNOT TRUST AN
INTERNATIONAL MERCENARY EXISTINGIN THE NETHERWORLD TWIXT
ASSASSIN AND BOUNTY HUNTER,WHOSE
VERY LIVELIHOOD IS PREDICATED ONTHE FLEXIBLE MORALITY NEEDED TO
SURVIVE IN THE CHAOS ANDLAWLESSNESS OF
FAILED NATIONS-- WHO CAN YOUTRUST?
( LAUGHTER )IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT SANTA
ISN'TREAL.
( LAUGHTER )SPOILER ALERT!
BUT YOU KNOW, "60 MINUTES" ISNOT THE ONLY VICTIM HERE.
A CERTAIN LINFORTH BOREGARDGRAHAM WILL ALSO PAY A PRICE FOR
THIS MAN'S INSOLENCE.
YOU SEE, BLANCHE DE GRAHAM,HAS BEEN
HOLDING UP PRESIDENTIALAPPOINTMENTS BASED ON THIS "60
MINUTES" REPORT EXPLAINING THATTHE F.B.I. REPORTS WILL
VINDICATE HIM.
>> WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT DIDNOT RELEASE IS THAT HE WAS
INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I. ON TWOSEPARATE OCCASIONS WHERE HE
CLAIMS TOHAVE TOLD THE F.B.I. THAT HE
WENT TO THE COMPOUND AND HEFOUND CHRIS STEVENS' BODY AT THE
HOSPITAL.
THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS A BAD HABITOF TELLING STORIES THAT ARE NOT
TRUE, THAT ARE POLITICALLYBENEFICIAL.
>> Jon:  AND I HAVE ALWAYSDEPENDED UPON THE TESTIMONY OF
STRANGERS!
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS )I DON'T KNOW HOW HE-- I DON'T
WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE.
HE'S GONE FROM BEING BLANCHDUBOIS TO FOGHORN LEGHORN.
HE SAYS THE F.B.I. TESTIMONY WASGOING TO VINDICATE HIM.
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THEOPPOSITE.
I IMAGINE HE'LL BE WHISTLING ADIFFERENT DIXIE POST-"60
MINUTES" APOLOGY.
>> BUT WHAT SPURRED YOUR ACTIONTO BLOCK THE PRESIDENT'S
NOMINEES WAS THE "60 MINUTES"REPORT.
>> I RELEASED TWO AMBASSADORSTHAT I HAD A HOLD ON BECAUSE
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT ABIPARTISAN WAY TO INTERVIEW
THESE WITNESSES.
>> RIGHT NOW, YOUR THREAT TOHOLD UP NOMINEES STANDS?
>> I'VE RELEASED TWO.
I'VE RELEASED TWO.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  AND YOU'RE ALL JUST
GOING TO HAVE TO FIND THE REST.
( APPLAUSE )IF I-- IF I-- IF I BELIEVE
YOU'RE UP TO THE CHALLENGE,DETECTIVE.
( LAUGHTER )I'D HURRY UP IF I WAS YOU
BECAUSE THE BASEMENT IS SLOWLYFILLING WITH PUDDING!
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
