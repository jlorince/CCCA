LEAD SHORTER LIVES THAN THEIRPARENTS.

STATISTIC.

THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBSIDIZINGTHE OBESITY EPIDEM.
>> WE PLACE PRIVATEPROFIT AHEAD OF PUBLIC HEALTH.
SYSTEMATIC POLITICAL FAILURE.

DIABETES.
>> THOSE DISEASES ARE BEINGDRIVEN BY SUGAR.
>> THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTALPROBLEM
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT INSOCIETY.
>> WE COULD CURE 80% OF THEPROBLEM WHERE THEY PREPARE THE
FOOD IN THE SCHOOL. YOU HAVE TOCHANGE THE DIET OF AMERICA.
>> IT'S ALL PREVENTABLE.
>> Jon:  IT'S A HORRORMOVIE.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, KATIE COURIC!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> I WAS GOING TO SAY GIVE ME
SOME SUGAR, AND THEN I THOUGHTBETTER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> NICE, NICE. I SEE WHAT YOUDID THERE.
♪ HI, KATIE COURIC ♪>> HI JON, HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon:  THIS DOCUMENTARY ISWILDLY DISTURBING.
>> YES, IT IS.
>> Jon:  AND IT IS PACKEDWITH FACTS THAT I THINK PEOPLE
MIGHT BE INCREDIBLY UNAWARE OF.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WESTARTED LOOKING INTO THIS.
I HAD COVERED THIS STORY FOR 35YEARS, MY ENTIRE CAREER, AND I
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEPROBLEM KEPT GETTING WORSE.
AND NOBODY WAS REALLYKIND OF ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES
AND DIGGING INTOTHE ROOT CAUSES OF THE EPIDEMIC,
BUT SOME OF THE STATISTICSWE DISCOVERED ARE REALLY
DISTURBING, AS YOU SAID, JON.STAGGERING.
IN 1980 THERE WERE ZERO CASES OFTYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG
ADOLESCENTS.
IN 2010, ALMOST 58,000 CASES OFTYPE 2 DIABETES.
ONE IN THREE PEOPLE BY 2050 ISGONNA HAVE DIABETES.
>> Jon:  AND 90% ARE GOING TO BEOBESE BY 2050?
>> IN TWO DECADES, 95% OF
AMERICANS WILL BE OVERWEIGHT OROBESE.
AND THIS I THINK IS THESADDEST STATISTIC OF ALL THAT
WE HEARD IN THAT CLIP.
THIS GENERATION OF CHILDREN ISTHE FIRST-- FIRST THAT WILL LIVE
SHORTER LIFESPANS THAN THEIRPARENTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THE WORST THINGI SAW-- OTHER THAN THE HUMAN
PAIN OF THESE KIDS.
>> OH, YEAH.
>> Jon:  WHICH ISHEARTBREAKING.
>> ISN'T IT AMAZING, BY THE WAY,THAT THEY PARTICIPATED IN THIS?
>> Jon:  YES.
>> I MEAN, THEY DESERVE SO MUCHCREDIT.
>> Jon:  INCREDIBLYCOURAGEOUS, AND THE STRUGGLE IS
ENORMOUS.
>> HEARTBREAKING.
>> Jon:  WHEN THEY PUT THEIRHEARTS ON THEIR SLEEVES LIKE
THAT IT IS JUST HEARTBREAKING.
BUT BEYOND THAT IS THECORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST
LEVELS.
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE A
REPORT-- AND YOU HAVE IT IN THEFILM-- THAT SAYS THESE ISSUES
ABOUT SUGAR -->> RIGHT, SUGAR SHOULD BE 10%,
NO MORE THAN 10% OF THE DIET.
>> Jon: RIGHT NO MORE THAN 10%.
WE SEND OVER TOMMYTHOMPSON TO TELL THEM, IF YOU
PUT THAT IN THERE, WE WILL NOTGIVE YOU THE MONEY --
>> THE $450 MILLION.
>> Jon:  THE $450 MILLION WEWERE GOING TO GIVE YOU AND THEY
TAKE IT OUT. WEBASICALLY BRIBE THE WORLD
HEALTH ORGANIZATION TO TAKE THISOUT.
>> WELL, AS ROBERT LUSTIG SAID,WE PRETTY MUCH EXTORT THEM INTO
KEEPING THAT QUIET.>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEN THE SUGAR LOBBYSAYS, ACTUALLY IT SHOULD
BE 25% OF YOUR DIET, WHICH ISTWO AND A HALF TIMES --
>> Jon:  THE QUESTION FORTHE SUGAR LOBBY GUY WAS
TREMENDOUS WHEN YOU ASKED HIM,YOU KNOW, IS SUGAR TIED TO THESE
THINGS-- IT REMINDS YOU OF THATTOBACCO STORY-- AND HE'S UNABLE
TO ANSWER IT.
>> WELL, AND A LOT OF THESESTUDIES ARE FINANCED,
UNFORTUNATELY BY, YOUKNOW, BIG FOOD COMPANIES.
>>Jon: RIGHT.
SO NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY'RE NOTEXACTLY PURE IN THEIR-- IN THEIR
EXECUTION.
>> Jon: BUT WHAT IS, IS THEANSWER PURELY ABOUT GOING BACK
TO A TIME WHEN WEDON'T ADD SUGAR?
BECAUSE WE DID EAT LIKE CRAP.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ITHINK, I THINK, I MEAN,
I THINK THERE'S A WHOLECONFLUENCE OF THINGS.
I THINK YOU REALLY-- YES, OFCOURSE, WE DID EAT SOME THINGS
THAT WEREN'T VERY HEALTHY BUT,YOU KNOW, ALL I CAN SAY IS THE
NUMBERS DON'T LIE, JON, RIGHT?
>> Jon: NO, NO, SOMETHING'SHAPPENING.
>> SO ALL WE CAN DO IS POINT TOSOME OF THE PROBLEMS, AND I
THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY REDUCEYOUR INTAKE OF PROCESSED FOODS,
PEOPLE SHOULD EAT WHOLE FOODS.
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY COOKANYMORE--
>> BUT EVERYBODYKNOWS THIS, DON'T THEY?
>> WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UPDIDN'T YOUR -- I DON'T KNOW.
IF THEY KNOW IT, THEY'RENOT DOING IT. AND I THINK THEY--
>> Jon:  BUT, ISN'T IT BECAUSEIT'S SO MUCH CHEAPER?
I MEAN, IF I'M OUT THERE, AND ICAN GO TO MCDONALDS AND GET --
>> NO, WE SHOW IN THE FILM, ASYOU SEE, WE SHOW A MEAL FROM A
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT, ANDA CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES
COOKED AT HOME ANDTHAT'S REALLY --
>> Jon: BUT THEY MADE IT.
AND THEY HAVE A DRIVE-THROUGH.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> THAT'S TRUE.
AND THE CONVENIENCE IS ATHING.
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ALLFIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE ARE
OUR PRIORITIES?
WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO?
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THISSOMETHING WE CARE ABOUT BECAUSE
WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR OUR KIDS,REALLY.
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, ASWE SAID, WE'RE KILLING PEOPLE.
>> Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU? I KNOW.
IT'S JUST-- SO OFTEN THEPOLITICIANS ALWAYS SAY WE MUST
DO IT FOR OUR KIDS, AND IT'SCLEAR TO ME, AT LEAST,
THAT WE HATE OUR KIDS.
( LAUGHTER )BECAUSE WE-- WE'VE BEEN HEARING
ABOUT THIS FOR, LIKE, 200 YEARSAND WE'RE LIKE YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
OUR KIDS.
WE NEVER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT REALLY FEELS LIKE A GIANTMOUNTAIN TO CLIMB.
>> WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, EVENSMALL STEPS, LIKE LOOKING AT
LABELS AND UNDERSTANDING--YOU KNOW, YOU NEED A
CALCULATOR WHEN YOU GO TO THEGROCERY STORE.
FOUR GRAMS OF SUGAR EQUALS ONETEASPOON, RIGHT.
AND YOU WOULD BE SHOCKED IF YOUADD UP THE ADDED SUGAR IN A LOT
OF PRODUCTS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
SO, I SHOP A LOT DIFFERENTLY.
I USED TO ALWAYS BUY LOW-FATSTUFF.
I DON'T NOW.
I LOOK AT THE SUGAR CONTENT, ANDI THINK EVEN IF PEOPLE WERE JUST
MORE MINDFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY'REBUYING,
>>Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> WHAT THEY'RE PURCHASING.
>> Jon: I THINK IT ALSO WORKS AS
PRESSURE ON A LARGER LEVELPOLITICALLY.
>> I HOPE SO.
>> Jon:  WHEN YOU DO SOME THINGSLIKE THIS IT SORT OF WAKES
PEOPLE UP.
>> THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS OFAMERICA JUST INVITED ME TO THEIR
ANNUAL LEADERSHIP FORUM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  I HAVE-- CAN I SAYTHIS?
>> YEAH.
>> Jon:  I HAVE THREE WORDSFOR YOU, YOUNG LADY.
>> BE CAREFUL?
PLEASE.
>> Jon:  NO, THAT'S TWO.
>> I ADDED PLEASE!
>> Jon: PLEASE. I WAS GOING TOGO WITH PAPER OR PLASTIC?
"FED UP" IS IN THE THEATERSNATIONWIDE ON FRIDAY.
ENJOY IT WITH SOME REESE'SPIECES AND SOME POPCORN.
>> NO!
COME ON!
>> Jon:  NO? THAT'S WRONG?
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE AT THEMOVIES.
