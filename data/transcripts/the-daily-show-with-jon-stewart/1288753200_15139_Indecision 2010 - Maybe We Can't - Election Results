I'M HOLDING UP TODAY'S PAPER,

ESTEEMED HISTORIAN MICHAEL
BESCHLOSS WILL BE HERE, BUT

THE G.O.P. HAS NOW PROJECTED TO
TAKE 692 SEATS FROM THE
DEMOCRATS OUT OF A POSSIBLE...
WELL, THERE WERE 100 UP FOR
GRABS, BUT SOMEHOW THEY HAVE

THE DEMOCRATS ARE PROJECTED TO
KEEP THE SENATE.
WE'LL GET TO SOME RESULTS HERE.
CONNECTICUT, WHICH AS YOU KNOW,
THE STATE THAT YOUR TRAIN GOES
THROUGH WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO
REACH A REAL CITY...
( LAUGHTER )
DEMOCRAT RICHARD BLUMENTHAL HAS
DEFEATED REPUBLICAN LINDA
McMAHON.
OH, THAT'S JUST UNNECESSARY.
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A DIFFICULT
RACE.
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR... THIS
IS VERY INTERESTING.
OBVIOUSLY SOUTH CAROLINA THE
FOURTH BEST CAROLINA OUT OF
NORTH CAROLINA AND TWO THAT
DON'T EXIST.
AND THEN SOUTH CAROLINA.
JIM DeMINT HAS DEFEATED ALVIN
GREENE.
JIM DeMINT SO CONFIDENT, HE
DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP TO HIS OWN
PICTURE ON THE HEAD SHOTMENT
THAT'S HOW CONFIDENT HE WAS IN
DEFEATING.
IN FLORIDA, MANY RESIDENTS, OF
COURSE, IN FLORIDA VOTED EARLY
AND OBVIOUSLY THEN WENT RIGHT TO
EAT DINNER.
( LAUGHTER )
MARCO RUBIO -- OH, THAT'S GOT TO
HURT.
MARCO RUBIO HAS DEFEATED CHARLIE
CRIST AND MEEK, KENDRICK MEEK,
THE DEMOCRAT THERE.
AND IN DELAWARE, OBVIOUSLY
EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING TOWARDS
THE DELAWARE RACE.
CHRIS COON, THE MARXIST AGAINST
CHRISTINE O'DONNELL, WHO IS NOT
A WITCH, BUT UNFORTUNATELY...
OH, SHE'S MELTING.
>> MELTING!
>> Jon: SHE'S NOT A WITCH, AND
YET WATER DID, IN FACT, MELT
HER.
AS ALWAYS, PREELECTION COVERAGE,
A LOT OF PREDICTING.
THIS YEAR'S PROGNOSTICATIONS
DEPENDED GREATLY DEPENDING ON
WHETHER THE PERSON PREDICTING IT
WAS A DEMOCRAT OR ANYBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD OTHER THAN A
DEMOCRAT.
>> WE'LL MAINTAIN BOTH HOUSES.
>> THIS WILL BE A BLOODBATH FOR
THE DEMOCRATS.
>> ALL SIDES POINTING TO A
MID-TERM BLOODBATH.
>> WE'RE ON PACE TO MAINTAIN THE
MAJORITY.
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A BLOODBATH.
♪ I'M SINGING IN THE RAIN ♪♪
>> Jon: THE STREETS WILL RUN
RED WITH VICTORY.
ALL RIGHT.
SO NOW THE PROGNOSTICATING IS
OVER.
FOR RESULTS ANALYSIS WE GO TO
THE BEST F'ING NEWS TEAM ON THE
PLANET.
FIRST UP, ASSIF MANDVI AT
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
HEADQUARTERS.
ASSIF, SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I SEE THE MOVING TRUCK BEHIND
YOU.
DEMOCRATS TALK AN OPTIMISTIC
GAME.
EVEN THEY REALIZE THEY ARE
HEADED TOWARDS THE OVERLOOKED
HOTEL AND THE BLOODBATH.
THE PURGE HAS BEGUN.
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME, JON,
DEMOCRATS HERE ARE DOUBLING
DOWN.
THEY ARE MOVING EQUIPMENT IN.
GIDDY IN ANTICIPATION OF WHAT
THEY BELIEVE WILL BE A LANDSLIDE
VICTORY.
>> Jon: THEY'RE DELUSIONAL.
THEY'RE BACKING UP THEIR HAPPY
WORDS WITH ACTION?
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
TODAY NANCY PELOSI HAD HER RIGHT
HAND REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A
GAVEL.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> MAHOGANY, NOT CHEAP.
>> Jon: NO, THANK YOU, ASSIF.
OLIVIA MUNN IS AT REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS.
OBVIOUSLY THE MOOD THERE
JUBILATION.
>> JON, AN HISTORIC NIGHT.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> NOT ONLY THE TEA PARTY
ASCENDED, BUT WITH THIS
REPUBLICAN WAVE BREAKING, IT
LOOKS LIKE OHIO'S JOHN BOEHNER
WILL BE THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE.
IT IS THE HIGHEST ELECTED OFFICE
EVER TO BE REACHED BY AN ORANGE
AMERICAN.
( LAUGHTER )
NO, NO, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, AN
AMERICAN OF ORANGE DISSENT.
ONCE RIDICULED, ORANGE AMERICANS
HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO MENIAL
JOBS SUCH AS COLLEGE MASCOT OR
REALITY TELEVISION SIDE SHOW OR
TYPECAST AS THE GAY MUPPET.
JOHN, TONIGHT IS THEIR NIGHT.
BECAUSE OF JOHN BOEHNER,
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE A LITTLE BOY
OR GIRL WITH A TERRIBLE FAKE TAN
KNOWS THAT HE HAS A FUTURE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, OLIVEA.
THAT'S VERY MOVING.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
JASON JONES... THAT'S VERY NICE,
OLIVEA.
JASON JONES IS IN SOUTH CAROLINA
WHERE ONE OF THE STRANGEST
SENATE CANDIDATES IN A LONG
TIME, DEMOCRAT ALVIN GREENE,
MADE HIS STAND.
JASON JOINS US NOW.
WHAT'S THE STORY THERE?
>> HERE AT GREENE CAMPAIGN
HEADQUARTERS/HIS DAD'S BASEMENT,
THE STORY IS I AM DESTROYING
ALVIN GREENE IN MADDEN.
AND I WOULD LIKE THE MAKE IT
CLEAR I LET HIM BEAT THE
STEELERS.
>> Jon: HOW IS ALVIN GREENE
TAKING THE LOSS IN THE SENATE
WHERE THEY'RE PROJECTING JIM
DeMINT 61% TO --
>> IF HIS GAME IS ANY
INDICATION, THE MAN IS USED TO
BEING SMOKED.
THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD HE HIGH-FIVE
YOU FOR BEATING HIM BADLY?
>> JON, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HE'S
A BIT OF A WEIRD DUDE.
>> Jon: HAS GREENE MADE A
CONCESSION PHONE CALL AT ALL
YET?
>> NEW YORK HE'S OUT OF MINUTES.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: HE'S OUT OF MINUTES?
CAN'T HE JUST USE THE HOUSE
PHONE.
>> HIS DAD'S NOT GOING TO LET
HIM USE THE HOUSE PHONE.
>> Jon: HOW IS ALVIN GREENE
GOING TO CONTACT JIM DeMINT TO
CONCEDE?
>> IS DeMINT ON XBOX LIVE?
>> Jon:, NO I DON'T THINK SO.
>> THEN ALVIN PROBABLY WON'T
CONCEDE.
HEY, G... THAT'S THE SOUND OF
HOT POCKETS.
I GOTTA GO.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THIS ELECTION MORE THAN ANY IN
RECENT MEMORY HAS A LOT OF
MOVING PARTS.
I'M REFERRING TO THE CABLE
NETWORKS AND THEIR INFATUATION
WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY.
CNN ALWAYS LEADS THE WAY WITH
ITS RAILWAY TIMETABLE OF
ELECTIONS AND ITS TETRIS NEWS,
TAKING ELECTION TO THE POINTLESS
THREE DIMENSIONAL RENDERING.
>> WHAT YOU'LL SEE NANCY PELOSI
DOING, WHEN REPUBLICANS LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE
CONTROL, SHE'LL MAKE IT
DISAPPEAR.
I'M TEASINGS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: FANCY.
UNUSEFUL, BUT FANCY.
I DON'T THINK ANY NETWORK WILL
BE ABLE TO TOP THAT.
>> THE BATTLE FOR THE HOUSE AND
THE SENATE, TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
VIRTUAL CAPITOL HERE.
>> WELL DONE, CNN.
A MUCH LARGER THREE DIMENSIONAL
RENDERING OF THE CAPITOL
BUILDING.
WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF NEXT,
OH, WAIT, I'VE GOT IT, A LARGER
ONE.
OF COURSE, HERE AT "THE DAILY
SHOW," WE HAVE OUR OWN ELECTION
CENTER MANNED BY JOHN OLIVER.
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR ELECTION
CENTER?
>> I'LL SHOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
HAVE TASTE OF MY HALLOW SUIT
BECAUSE I AM THE CAPITOL DOME,
JOHN.
OH, SURE, THEY'LL GIVE RESULT,
BUT I WILL BE RESULT, JOHN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
KENTUCKY SENATE?
NO PROBLEM, INITIATES RESULTS
SEQUENCE.
RAPID PAUL VERSUS JACK CONWAY.
I'M RAND PAUL.
LOOK AT ME.
I'M THE NEW SENATOR FROM
KENTUCKY.
LET'S HAVE A MINT JULEP AND RIDE
SOME HORSES BECAUSE I'M RAND
PAUL, NEW SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY.
PRETTY HAIRY, HUH?
HOW ABOUT THAT.
PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
>> VERY GOOD.
>> Jon: HOW MUCH DID WE SPEND
ON THIS?
>> ENOUGH THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAD
TO UNITES
