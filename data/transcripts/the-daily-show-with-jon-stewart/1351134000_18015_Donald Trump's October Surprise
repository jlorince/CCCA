[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MAN, WE'VE GOT SO MUCH TO GET THROUGH TONIGHT, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
WE GOT SO MUCH TO GET THROUGH TONIGHT, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
WE TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION.
DONALD TRUMP TODAY AT NOON MADE THAT HUGE, CAMPAIGN-SHAKING ANNOUNCEMENT HE HAD BEEN PROMISING.
HE OFFERED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A CHARITY GIFT OF $5 MILLION IF THE PRESIDENT WOULD RELEASE HIS COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF TRUMP MAKING IT...
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH, OH, WAIT A SECOND.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
THAT WASN'T DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO PUBLICLY EXTORT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT WAS A GORILLA EATING ITS OWN [BLEEPED].
MY APOLOGIES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT... THAT WAS WEIRD.
ANYWAY, SARAH PALIN CHIMED IN, ACCUSED THE PRESIDENT OF "SHUCKING AND JIVING." YEAH, HER WORDS, "SHUCKING AND
JIVING" ABOUT LIBYA.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HER STATEMENT.
OH, WAIT.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S... HUH.
HUH.
I APOLOGIZE.
THAT WAS A HIPPO SPRAYING ITS OWN [BLEEPED] THROUGH ITS TAIL.
AGAIN, I... I DON'T KNOW HOW I ENDED UP CONFUSING THESE IMAGES.
