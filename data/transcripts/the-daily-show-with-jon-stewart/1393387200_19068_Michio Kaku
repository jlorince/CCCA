[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A THEORETICALPHYSICIST, BEST SELLING AUTHOR
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THEFUTURE OF THE MIND.
THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST TOUNDERSTAND,
ENHANCE AND EMPOWER THE MIND.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMMICHIO KAKU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> THANKS.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
>> VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE.
>> GLAD TO BE ON.
>> Jon: THE FUTURE OF THEMIND.
THIS IS -- I THINK, A SUBJECTWHICH IS SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO
COMPREHEND AND IT -- YOU FINDYOURSELF IN A FEEDBACK LOOP OF
STUPIDITY.
[ LAUGHTER ]FOR ME -- THE PREMISE IS THAT
THE MIND IS SOMETHING THAT WEWILL FIND DOWNLOADABLE TO SOME
EXTENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THINK OF ALL THE COLLEGE COURSESTHAT WE FLUNKED WHEN WE WERE
YOUNGER, ALL THE COURSES WE CUT.
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A PLAYBUTTON.
YOU HIT THE PLAY BUTTON, AND YOUUPLOAD MATHEMATICS, UPLOADCALCULUS INTO YOUR BRAIN.
IT'S BEEN DONE ON A SMALL LEVELWITH MICE.
WE CAN ACTUALLY UPLOAD MEMORIES.
>> Jon: IS THAT MOUSE'S NAMEALGERNON BY ANY CHANCE?
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW THIS ENDS?
[LAUGHTER]>> EVENTUALLY WE'LL DO IT WITH
PRIMATES AND EVENTUALLY PERHAPSWITH ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS.
WE'LL HAVE A BRAIN PACEMAKERTHAT ALLOWS US TO UPLOAD
MEMORIES TO A DAMAGEDHIPPOCAMPUS, LOCATED RIGHT HERE,SO THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE
ALZHEIMER'S WILL HAVE MEMORYAGAIN.
IT'S ONE OF THEOBJECTIVES OF BEING ABLE TO
UPLOAD A MEMORY.
>> Jon: INCREDIBLE.
THE IDEA WOULD BE WHILE ONE SIDEOF THE INDUSTRY FOCUSES ON MAYBE
FIXING THE PATHWAYS BIOLOGICALLYTHERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SCIENCE
THAT IS WORKING AT THIS THROUGHDATA?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DECIPHERTHE THINKING BRAIN AND PERHAPS
CONNECT THE BRAIN TO A ROBOT ORA MACHINE.
THINK OF STEPHEN HAWKING MYCOLLEAGUE.
HE IS TOTALLY PARALYZED.
HE HAS A CHIP IN HIS RIGHTFRAME.
NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM ON TV LOOKAT HIS GLASSES. THERE'S A CHIPTHERE THAT PICKS
UP RADIO WAVES FROM HIS MIND,TRANSFERS IT TO A LAPTOP AND HE
CAN MENTALLY TYPE.
>> Jon: THIS IS SOMETHINGPRESENT NOW.
>> NOW.
>> Jon: AND HOW DOES HIS --HOW DOES THE CHIP IN HIS GLASSES
PICK UP A RADIO WAVE THAT HEGENERATES FROM HIS BRAIN?
>> BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLOSE TOTHE BRAIN.
FOR OTHERPATIENTS WE PUT IT DIRECTLY ON
THE BRAIN ITSELF.
A CHIP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DIMECONNECTING THE CHIP TO A LAPTOP
AND THEN THE PERSON CAN OPERATEA WHEELCHAIR, OPERATE HOUSEHOLD
APPLIANCES, SURF THE WEB,ANSWER E-MAILS EVEN IF HE IS
TOTALLY PARALYZED.
>> Jon: IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IS HIS CHIP NOT IN HIS BRAINBECAUSE HIS BRAIN IS SO STRONG?
[LAUGHTER]IF YOU PUT THE CHIP ON HIS BRAIN
THE CHIP WOULD BE LIKE STOPYELLING, I CAN HEAR YOU, YOU ARE
SO BRAINY.
[LAUGHTER]BUT IN TERMS OF AMOUNTS OF DATA,
I WOULD IMAGINE LIKE WE'REACCUSTOMED TO THIS IDEA, OHWE'VE MAPPED
THE HUMAN GENOME. WHAT IS THEAMOUNT OF DATA THAT THE HUMANGENOME ENCOMPASSES?
>> IT'S PEANUTS COMPARED TO THECOMPLEXITY OF THE BRAIN.
WHAT SITS ON YOUR SHOULDER ISTHE MOST COMPLEX OBJECT IN THE
KNOWN UNIVERSE.
>> Jon: IN TERMS OF COMPUTINGPOWER WE HAVE NOW IN TERMS OF
TRYING TO DISSEMINATE THEAMOUNT OF ACTIVITY AND DATA
FLOWING THROUGH THE BRAIN, WHEREWOULD WE NEED TO GET TO BEFORE
IT'S A FEASIBLE TRANSACTION?
>> WE WOULD HAVE TO BUILD ACOMPUTER THE SIZE OF A CITY
BLOCK COOLED BY A RIVER.
ENERGIZED BY A NUCLEAR POWERPLANT TO MIMIC THECOMPUTATIONAL POWER OF YOUR
BRAIN WHICH DOES IT FOR 20WATTS.
WHEN SOMEONE CALLS YOU A DIMBULB IT'S A COMPLIMENT.
>> Jon: IT IS A COMPLIMENT.
20 WATTS OF POWER TO POWER THEBRAIN.
SO WHY IS THAT?
WHAT IS THE ENERGY SOURCE OF THEBRAIN THAT WE'RE UNABLE TO
FIGURE OUT.
>> FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S JUST AFEW HAMBURGERS.
HOWEVER, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEBRAIN ACTUALLY FUNCTIONS.
THE BRAIN IS NOT A COMPUTER INTHE NORMAL SENSE OF THE WORD.
THERE'S NO OPERATING SYSTEM.
THERE'S NO PENTIUM CHIP, THERE'SNO WINDOWS.
IT'S A LEARNING MACHINE.
IT LEARNS.
>> Jon: CAN IT EXIST OUTSIDE OFUS?
>> WELL, IF PRESIDENT OBAMA'SBRAIN INITIATIVE SUCCEEDS, WEWILL HAVE A CD ROM
>> Jon: WHAT?
HE HAS A BRAIN INITIATIVE?
HE CAN'T RUN A WEB SITE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
A BRAIN INITIATIVE?
>> THEY WANT TO DUMP $1 BILLIONTO MAP ALL THE PATHWAYS OF THEHUMAN
BRAIN TO SOLVE THE QUESTION OFMENTAL ILLNESS LIKE
SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR DISORDERAND ONE DAY THEY MAY HAVE A CD
ROM WITH ALL YOURPERSONALITY, ALL YOURNEURONS ON IT, THAT WILL LIVE ONAFTER YOU DIE.
IN OTHER WORDS SOME FORM OFIMMORTALITY IS A POSSIBILITYTHAT
CONSCIOUSNESS MAY EXIST EVENOUTSIDE THE HUMAN BODY.
IT WOULD BE NICE, RIGHT, LIVINGFOREVER?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: SORRY I'M THINKING OF
LIKE 300 YEARS FROM NOW, YOUKNOW, PEOPLE THAT -- YOUR KIDS
AND KIDS AND KIDS TAKING YOU OUTOF A CD JACKET.
LET'S HANG WITH GRANDPA FOR ALITTLE BIT.
>> AND YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BEABLE TO HAVE A CHAT WITH YOU.
PERSONALITY TRAITS, MANNERISMSWILL BE THERE.
>> ALL CONSCIOUSNESS IS ARETHESE DATA POINTS?
>> IN SOME SENSE IN THIS LINEOF APPROACH YOUR PERSONALITYYOUR QUOTE SOUL
WOULD BE REDUCED TO DIGITALINFORMATION THAT IN SOME SENSE
YOUR GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDKIDS COULD ACCESS TO HAVE ANEVENING CONVERSATION WITH YOU?
>> Jon: DON'T YOU THINKTHERE'S SPECIAL SAUCE WE DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT IS MORE THANJUST THE FUNCTIONS?
>> YEAH, THERE'S ALWAYS THE WILDCARDS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
IF YOU ARE HIT IN THE LEFT PARTOF THE BRAIN.
>> Jon: NOW YOU ARE JUSTGETTING WEIRD.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> CERTAIN PEOPLE DEVELOP
ENORMOUS MATHEMATICAL POWERS.
THEY BECOME SUPER GENIUSES.
THIS IS NOT THE AVERAGE BLOW TOTHE BRAIN.
DON'T GO HOME AND SOCK YOURSELFIN THE BRAIN TONIGHT HOPING TO
BECOME A SUPERGENIUS.
>> Jon: THAT IS SMART.
>> IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.
WE THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE BRAINHAS LOST ITS ABILITY TO FORGET.
A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY IS NOTBECAUSE MEMORIES DIE DOWN WITH
TIME.
WE FORGET HOW TO FORGET.
THE FORGETTING MECHANISM ISDISABLED IN THESE INDIVIDUALS SO
IT'S LIKE A TAPE RECORDER THATKEEPS ON TAPING AND NEVER
ERASING.
>> Jon: DOES IT RUN OUT OFMEMORY AT THAT POINT OR WILL IT
CONTINUE TO GO?
>> IT CONTINUES TO GO.
THESE PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER A DAY30 YEARS AGO ON A TUESDAY ON AN
AFTERNOON AT 2:00 IN THEAFTERNOON THEY CAN TELL YOU WHAT
BOOK THEY WERE READING ON WHATPAGE.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD OUR BRAINSNOT DO THAT ALL THE TIME?
WHY NOT BUY THE BRAIN WITH THEMOST MEMORY?
>> BECAUSE EVENTUALLY IT TRIPSYOU UP.
YOU GET MEMORY OVERFLOW.
YOU GET PARALYZED WITH SO MANYMEMORIES COMING AT YOU.
MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, FOREXAMPLE HAVE A
HARD TIME KEEPING AN ORDINARYJOB BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER TOO
MUCH.
WE FORGET FOR A REASON BELIEVEIT OR NOT BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR
SURVIVAL AND EVOLUTION TOFORGET.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT BOOZE IS,YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE.
WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF REALLY,TRULY AMAZING THINGS, ARE WE
NOT?
>> THIS IS THE GOLDEN AGE OFBRAIN RESEARCH.
>> Jon: I'M EXCITED ABOUTTHIS.
THE FUTURE OF THE MIND.
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
VERY, VERY FASCINATING.
MICHIO KAKU.
THANK YOU.
