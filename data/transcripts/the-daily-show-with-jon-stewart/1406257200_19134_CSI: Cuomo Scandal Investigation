SPEAKING OF OUR FAIR CITY ANDSTATE, NEW YORK HAS HAD ITS FAIR
SHARE OF ALBANY-BASED CORRUPTIONIN RECENT YEARS, WHETHER IT BE
NEW YORK STATE SENATOR MALCOLMSMITH TRYING TO BUY HIS WAY ON
TO THE MAYORAL BALLOT LAST YEAR,STATE SENATOR JOHN SAMPSON'S
$440,000 EMBEZZLEMENT CASE ORPERHAPS YOU'D PREFER SOMETHING
MORE COMPLEX, MORESOPHISTICATED.
STATE ASSEMBLYMAN ERICSTEVENSON CAUGHT ACCEPTING
BRIBES IN EXCHANGE FORLEGISLATION ON A WIRE STING
CONDUCTED BY ANOTHERASSEMBLYMAN MR. CASTRO,
COOPERATING, MOST LIKELYAFTER BEING INDICTED HIMSELF ON
PERJURY CHARGES.
YES, ALBANY IS A VERITABLE[BLEEPED] MAN'S SAMPLER OF
CORRUPTION.
OH, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
OH, THIS ONE, OH, YEAH, THISTASTES LIKE STATE SENATOR
MONSERRATE'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCEISSUES.
MMM, WITH A FEDERAL MAIL FRAUDGANACHE AND JUST A HINT, A HINT
OF CONSPIRACY CHARGES NOUGAT.
MMM, MMM.
BUT A FEW YEARS BACK THEREEMERGE A MAN PROMISING TO CHANGE
ALL THAT.
[LAUGHTER]I HAD TO PICK THE ONE WITH THE
CARAMEL. I HAD TO PICK THECARAMEL.
HAD TO PICK THE ONE THAT DOESN'TDIGEST FOR LIKE AN HOUR AND A
HALF.
THERE WE GO.
THERE EMERGED A MAN TO FIGHTTHIS, A CORRUPTION BATTLING
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
NO, NOT THAT ONE.
NOT THE ONE WHO HAD TO RESIGN INHIS OWN PERSONAL CORRUPTION
SCANDAL.
THAT'S THE ONE.
ANDREW CUOMO, A CORRUPTIONFIGHTING FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL
WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR GOVERNOR ONONE OFT-REPEATED PLEDGE.
>> IT'S ABOUT TIME WE CLEAN UPALBANY.
>> CLEAN UP ALBANY.
WE'RE GOING TO START WITHCLEANING UP ALBANY.
WE NEED TO CLEAN UP ALBANY NOW.
>> Jon: AND WHILE I HAVE YOU,HAVE YOU BEEN INJURED IN CAR
ACCIDENT?
[LAUGHTER]HAVE YOU BEEN EXPOSED TO
ASBESTOS?
I CAN HELP ALL THREE THINGS.
ANYWAY, CUOMO WAS ELECTED ANDTHEN TRIED TO ENACT SOMETHING
CALLED "THE PUBLIC TRUST ACT."
WHICH WOULD ENHANCE PROSECUTORS'ABILITIES TO CRACK DOWN ON
PUBLIC CORRUPTION.
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE PROBLEMWITH THIS, IT TURNS OUT
LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT AREFETID SWAMPS OF CORRUPTION
ARE GENERALLY LOATHE TO PASSDREDGING LEGISLATION.
WE ALL REMEMBER SENATOR PIGPEN'SVERY FAMOUS FILIBUSTER OF THE
1952 BATH ACT.
[LAUGHTER]WELL, GUESS WHAT?
GOVERNOR CUOMO DOESN'T TAKENO-MO.
FOR... FOR, AH [BLEEPED] IT,HE TRIED SOMETHING ELSE.
>> IN RESPONSE, THE GOVERNORCREATED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE
MOORELAND COMMISSION TOINVESTIGATE CORRUPTION WITHIN
THE LEGISLATURE.
>> Jon: OH, SO CORRUPTION ISNOT ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM TO PASS
LEGISLATION.
WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU WOULDN'TMIND IF MY COMMISSION LOOKED
UNDER HERE.
WHAT'S UNDER HERE?
AND LO AND BEHOLD, JUST NINEMONTHS LATER...
>> LAST MONTH THE LEGISLATUREPASSED THE ETHICS BILL AS PART
OF THE STATE BUDGET.
AND CUOMO MADE THE DECISION TODISBAND HIS COMMISSION.
>> Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT,FOLKS.
COMMISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
AS ANDREW CUOMO CAMPAIGNS FORHIS REELECTION, HE CAN BE SECURE
KNOWING THAT HIS TENACITY HELPEDCLEAN UP GOTHAM CITY.
A REFORMER WHO ROSE ABOVEPOLITICS AS USUAL CORRUPTION
BECAUSE OF GREAT POWER COMESGREAT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE
HULK SMASH.
>> REPORTS IN THE "NEW YORKTIMES" CLAIM THAT AFTER
APPOINTING THE COMMISSION,THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE
INTERFERED WITH ITS WORK,"OBJECTING WHENEVER THE
COMMISSION FOCUSED ON GROUPSWITH TIES TO MR. CUOMO."
>> THE GOVERNOR CREATED A PANELTO TACKLE CORRUPTION THEN
SYSTEMATICALLY BLOCKED IT FROMPROBING ANYTHING RELATED TO
HIMSELF.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: SAY IT AIN'T SO, ANDY.
SAY IT AIN'T SO.
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE HE EVER SAIDTHE COMMISSION COULD INVESTIGATE
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.
>> THE COMMISSION CLEARLY HASTHE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO LOOK AT
ANYTHING THEY WANT TO LOOK AT,INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR, THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL, THECONTROLLER, ET CETERA.
THEY HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY.
>> Jon: BASICALLY CUOMO FORMEDA COMMISSION PROMISING YOU CAN
EVEN LOOK AT ME, AND THEN WHENTHEY LOOKED AT HIM, HE SAID, YOU
LOOKIN' AT ME?
YOU LOOKIN' AT ME?
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER GOVERNORSHERE.
YOU LOOKIN' AT ME?
YOU LOOKIN' AT ME?
SO, GOVERNOR CUOMO?
>> GOVERNOR CUOMO'S OFFICE GAVETHE TIMES A 13-PAGE STATEMENT.
"A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY ANDSTAFFED BY THE EXECUTIVE CANNOT
INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE."
>> ARGUING THAT SINCE HE CREATEDIT AND THAT SINCE THE COMMISSION
REPORTED TO HIM, HE COULD NOT BEACCUSED OF INTERFERENCE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THAT[BLEEPED] RIDICULOUS, RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]YOU KNOW THE "I MADE IT I CAN DO
WHAT I WANT WITH IT EXCUSE" ONLYWORKS FOR GEORGE LUCAS.
YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT?
I DON'T CARE HOW INCONGRESS ITIS THAT THIS SPACE WESTERN NOW
INCLUDES A REGGAE RABBIT LIVINGUNDER THE SEA.
HE STAYS IN THE PICTURE.
HE STAYS!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]NOW WHY COULDN'T...
>> REGGAE RABBIT.
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, GEORGE.
TURNS OUT GOVERNOR CUOMO MAY BELIKE THE BOSS WHO SAYS,
YEAH NO, WE'LL PLAY HOOPS ATLUNCH. YOU CAN GO HARD.
WHEN JIMMY FROM ACCOUNTINGBLOCKS HIS SHOT AS HE DRIVES THE
LANE, HE GOES, HEY, THE OTHERTEAM'S NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH
THE BALL BECAUSE ISTARTED THE GAME.
LOOK, I REALLY HOPE THERE'SNOTHING TO THIS BECAUSE
NEW YORK'S GOVERNORS HAVE TWOHALLS, SHAME AND FAME.
AND ONE OF THEM IS VERY CROWDED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
