>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR
WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THERE
IS POWER IN A UNION: THE EPIC
STORY OF LABOR IN AMERICA."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
PHILIP DRAY.
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: THERE IS POWER IN A
UNION.
HAVE WE IN THIS COUNTRY, DO YOU
THINK, HAVE WE FORGOTTEN THE
STORY OF LABOR IN THIS COUNTRY?
HAVE WE FORGOTTEN THE STRUGGLE
THAT PEOPLE WENT THROUGH AT THE
TURN OF THE CENTURY, LAST
CENTURY?
>> I THINK TO A GREAT EXTENT WE
HAVE.
THAT'S REALLY WHAT PROMPTED ME
TO WRITE THE BOOK BECAUSE I FELT
THAT THIS MOVEMENT, WHICH OUR
GRANDPARENTS AND GREAT
GRANDPARENTS WERE SO INVOLVED IN
AND THAT ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH, A
LOT OF THE STANDARDS OF
WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HOURS AND
CONDITIONS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED,
THAT STORY HAD LARGELY BEEN
FORGOTTEN.
IT'S A GREAT STORY OF A SOCIAL
MOVEMENT.
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH
REMEMBERING.
>> Jon: IT IS, YOU KNOW, THE
VIOLENCE THAT CAME ALONG WITH
FIGHTING TO NOT HAVE TO WORK IN
A MINE FOR THE HOURS THAT THEY
HAD TO OR NOT HAVE TO SHOP AT A
COMPANY STORE.
HOW WERE THE WORKERS ABLE TO
WITHSTAND THE KINDS OF ASSAULTS
THAT WERE ON THEM?
>> WELL, IT WAS... YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT WAS VERY VIOLENT,
PARTICULARLY IN THE 19th
CENTURY.
THE WORKERS REALLY HAD... THE
GOVERNMENT TOOK HANDS-OFF
ATTITUDE UNTIL THEY STARTED
SENDING IN FEDERAL SOLDIERS, AND
WORKERS WERE OFTEN PUT DOWN
VIOLENTLY.
YOU KNOW, THE ARMORY BUILDINGS
WE SEE IN OUR BIG CITIES TODAY,
MOST OF THEM WERE PUT THERE SO
TROOPS WOULD BE ABLE TO GATHER
NEAR PLACES OF WORK.
>> Jon: THE STEEL STRIKE IN
PARTICULAR, THE PINKERTON FELLAS
WENT IN.
>> THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE OF 1892,
VERY VIOLENT.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, YOU CAN
IMAGINE THE NATION WOULD BE
OUTRAGED AT THE VIOLENCE, PEOPLE
HAD BEEN KILLED, THERE WOULD BE
PROMISES OF REFORM, AND THAT
ACTUALLY DID SLOWLY KIND OF MOVE
THINGS FORWARD TO THE POINT
WHERE WE REACHED IN THE
PROGRESSIVE ERA WHAT THEY CALLED
INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY, A FEELING
AMONGST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
THAT THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY
TO DO THIS.
IT'S HURT PROGRESS DUCK
DIFFICULT AND PROFITS AND WE
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS KIND OF
LARGE GROUP OF UNRULY, ANGRY
PEOPLE IN OUR NATION'S CITIES.
>> RIGHT.
THAT'S GOTTEN US TO THE POINT
TODAY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
IN THE WORKPLACE IS YOU'RE JUST
NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THAT
MUCH PORN.
[LAUGHTER]
HAVE THE UNIONS, THOUGH, THE
JOURNEY NOW, AND I IMAGINE THERE
IS ANOTHER MOVEMENT AFOOT, SO
THESE GROUPS THAT FOUGHT SO HARD
TO GAIN THE BASIC RESPECT AND
RIGHTS FOR THE WORKERS, HAVE
THEY THEMSELVES NOW BECOME SO
ENTRENCHED AND BLOATED THAT THEY
HAVE BECOME THE AGENTS OF
CORRUPTION?
>> WELL, I THINK TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE
PROBLEMS FOR UNIONS OVER THE
LAST HALF CENTURY OR SO.
THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
SELF-MADE.
A LOT OF THE BIG UNIONS BEGAN TO
MIMIC BIG BUSINESS.
THEY HAD HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY
ON HAND.
THE LEADERS TENDED TO BE PEOPLE
WHO HAD NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN RANK
AND FILE, SO THERE WAS A
DISTANCE.
>>
>> Jon: AND THEY USE THE SAME
TYPE OF INTIMIDATION IN SOME
RESPECTS.
>> EXACTLY.
MANY OF THE LEADERS WERE
CHARISMATIC FIGURES WHO COULDN'T
BE QUESTIONED FROM BELOW.
ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH,
OF COURSE, A LOT OF THESE
CORRUPTION CASES ARE FAMOUS, I
THINK ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL NOT
TO TAINT THE ENTIRE LABOR
MOVEMENT WITH THIS IDEA THAT
IT'S CORRUPT.
I THINK PEOPLE HOLD IT TO A
HIGHER STANDARD BECAUSE IT'S A
SOCIAL, ECONOMIC JUSTICE
MOVEMENT, BUT FOR EVERY HEADLINE
ABOUT CORRUPTION, THERE ARE
HUNDREDS OF LEGITIMATE LEGALLY
FUNCTIONING LOCAL UNIONS ACROSS
THE COUNTRY AND ALWAYS HAVE
BEEN.
>> WHERE DO YOU SEE THE VIBE SI
OF THE UNION MOVEMENT RIGHT NOW?
WHERE DO YOU THINK THE BEST WORK
IS BEING DONE, AND WHERE DO YOU
THINK THE MOST WORK NEEDS TO BE
DONE TO REIN IN THEIR POWER?
>> WELL, A COUPLE DIFFERENT
THINGS?
ONE, OF COURSE, IS THE LAST... I
THINK FOR MANY YEARS UNIONS WERE
KIND OF ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL.
I THINK THEY'VE COME ALIVE A
LITTLE BIT IN THE LAST
GENERATION OR SOME YOU SEE A LOT
OF ORGANIZING OF PEOPLE WHO HAD
NEVER REALLY BEEN ORGANIZED
BEFORE, JANITOR, HOSPITAL
WORKERS, JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
OUT IN LOS ANGELES, THE CAR
WASH, 10,000 CAR WASH WORKERS
BEGAN TO ORGANIZE, SO YOU SEE
THAT IN AMERICA.
YOU ALSO SEE KIND OF AN ATTEMPT
FOR LABOR TO SORT OF GO GLOBAL
REALLY, IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WITH
GLOBALIZATION, BECAUSE JOBS HAVE
BEEN SENT OVERSEAS, LABOR HAS TO
FIND A WAY TO COORDINATE WORKERS
OVERSEAS.
AND THAT LABOR MOVEMENT, ONE
THAT INVOLVES HUMAN RIGHTS
GROUP, WOMEN RIGHTS GROUP,
ANTI-SWEATSHOP ORGANIZATIONS
INVOLVING CONSUMERS, THAT'S SORT
OF PICKING UP SPEED.
WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TEN OR
15 YEARS TO SEE IF THAT WILL
REALLY EVOLVE.
>> RIGHT.
AND IN TERMS OF THE AREAS WHERE
YOU THINK IT NEEDS REFORM, THE
ACTUAL UNION MOVEMENT ITSELF
NEEDS REFORM, WHERE DO YOU SEE
THAT?
>> WELL, I THINK YOU SEE THAT IN
A LOT OF UNIONS NOW BEING ASKED
FOR ACCOMMODATIONS OR PUSHBACK,
IN OTHER WORDS, TO KEEP
INSTITUTIONS OR COMPANIES VIABLE
>> Jon: HAVE THE UNIONS BEEN
GOOD PARTNERS TO THE AUTOMOTIVE
INDUSTRY, HAVE THEY BEEN GOOD
PARTNERS IN EDUCATION?
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THOSE UNIONS
HAVE BEEN GOOD PARTNERS?
>> THE UNITED AUTOWORKERS DID
GIVE A NUMBER OF THINGS BACK IN
TERMS OF PRIVILEGES AND BENEFITS
THEY HAD ACCRUED.
IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO GIVE UP
SOMETHING YOU FOUGHT FOR AND
WON.
THIS GOES BACK TO THE 1950s
WHEN THEY DECIDED THEY DIDN'T
NEED FIREMEN ON LOCOMOTIVES
ANYMORE.
THEY DIDN'T WANT THE LOSE THEIR
JOBS.
THEY WERE PROTECTED BY THE
UNION.
THERE'S BEEN VARIATIONS OF THAT
ALL ALONG.
NOW YOU HAVE THE TEACHERS UNION,
AS WELL, TRYING TO WORK WITH NEW
CHARTER SCHOOLS, TRYING TO FIND
A WAY TO ACCOMMODATE REFORM
WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR OWN
RANK AND FILE.
>> YOU WERE IN THE MUSICIANS
UNION.
>> YES.
>> Jon: APPARENTLY THERE WAS
AN INCIDENT.
>> THIS WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO
BEING A UNION MEMBER.
I WAS IN THE MINNEAPOLIS
MUSICIANS UNION MANY YEARS AGO.
AFTER HAVING TO SWEAR I WOULD
NEVER PLAY A MELATRON, AN
INSTRUMENT THAT COULD EMULATE
OTHER INSTRUMENTS AND TAKE
PEOPLE'S JOBS, THEY SAID, WE
HAVE TO STOP THE HARLEM
GLOBETROTTERS.
>> Jon:, YES, THE HARLEM
GLOBETROTTERS, THE MAN.
>> THE UNION WAS UPSET BECAUSE
THE GLOBETROTTERS WERE COMING TO
TOWN, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT THE
HIRE AN EIGHT-PIECE ORCHESTRA.
THEY WANTED TO USE A TAPE
RECORDING OF "SWEET GEORGIA
BROWN," THEIR THEME SONG.
SO THE OLDER MEMBERS BEGAN
CALLING PEOPLE LIKE ME SAYING, I
NEED YOU ON THE PICKET LINE.
WE WERE INCLINED TO SAY, OF
COURSE THEY WANT TO USE A TAPE
RECORDER.
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
THAT WAS A GENERATIONAL SWITCH,
A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT
THINGS.
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY EVER
STOPPED THE HARLEM
GLOBETROTTERS.
>> Jon: UNFORTUNATELY FIFE
PEOPLE DIED, BUT...
[LAUGHTER]
BUT IT IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO
REMEMBER, THOUGH, WHERE THE
MOVEMENT CAME FROM AND THE
STRUGGLE THAT IT DID JUST TO GET
PEOPLE THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS
THAT WORKERS SHOULD ENJOY.
IT'S A REALLY FASCINATING AND
GREAT STORY.
THANK YOU FOR WRITING THAT.
THERE IS POWER IN A UNION.
