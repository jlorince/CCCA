WE GOT A NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU.MY GUEST TONIGHT,
TRACY DROZ TRAGOS, SHE IS THEDIRECTOR OF THE
DOCUMENTARY "RICH HILL," WHICH
IS, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WORK. IT'SVERY POWERFUL.
YOU SHOULD SEE IT.
OBVIOUSLY NOT RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER]DO IT IN A HALF HOUR.
BUT FIRST, THE OFFICIAL RESPONSEGENERALLY TO THE PRESIDENT'S
STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH HASALWAYS BEEN A PRESTIGE SLOT FOR
POLITICIANS WHO WISH TO DESTROYTHEIR OWN PRESIDENTIAL
AMBITIONS.
[LAUGHTER]FROM RISING STAR LOUISIANA
GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL TO MITCHDANIELS'S DISQUALIFYING HAUNTED
HOUSE APPARITION IMPRESSIONTO MARCO RUBIO'S WHY DID I
EAT THE SILICA GEL DESICCANTI FOUND IN MY SUIT POCKET?
I'M SO THIRSTY!
IT'S CLEARLY MARKED DO NOTEAT.
NOT EVERYONE FACES SUCHIMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION.
VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOBMCDONNELL'S STATE OF THE UNION
REBUTTAL WAS WELL RECEIVED ANDWELL DELIVERED, BUT DON'T THINK
THAT WILL ALLOW HIM TO ESCAPETHE CURSE.
[MANIACAL LAUGHING]>> THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF
VIRGINIA AND HIS WIFE ON TRIALFOR CORRUPTION.
>> FOR INFLUENCE PEDDLING.
EXCHANGING $165,000 INGIFTS FOR POLITICAL FAVORS.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
VIRGINIA IS FOR LOVERS OF MONEY.
BUT YOU KNOW COLD HARD CASHCAN'T HOLD YOU AT NIGHT, AND
A BLANK CHECK CAN'T WIPE AWAYYOUR TEARS.
YOU CAN'T LAY A SACAGAWEA COINON A BED OF ROSE PEDALS AND
SOFTLY -- I'M SORRY.
I'M WORKING ON OUR ROMANCENOVEL.
IT'S IN THE SUBGENRE OF THEPARANORMAL SUBGENRE OF THE TEEN
ROMANCE NOVEL SUBGENRE.
THE FEDS SAY MCDONNELL AND HISWIFE WERE SHOWERED WITH GIFTS
FROM MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMANJOHNNIE WILLIAMS IN EXCHANGE FOR
SPECIAL TREATMENT.
BUT THAT'S JUST ONE SIDE OF THESTORY.
WHAT DOES MILLIONAIREBUSINESSMAN JOHNNIE WILLIAMS
SAY?
>> WILLIAMS SAYS HE SHOWEREDFORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOB
MCDONNELL AND HIS WIFE WITHGIFTS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR HELP
PROMOTING THE TOBACCO-BASED PILLHE'D INVENTED AND WAS PITCHING
AS A WONDER DRUG OF SORTS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I GUESS THERE IS ONLY
ONE SIDE OF THE STORY. BY THEWAY, THE WONDER DRUG THAT HE
WAS PITCHING IS CALLEDANATABOLIC OR ANTABLOC.
I'M SORRY. AND YOUMAY BE WONDERING HOW SOMEONE
COULD TURN A TOBACCO-BASED PILL
INTO A WONDER DRUG, BECAUSETHAT'S WHAT IT IS, SEEING AS
MOST TOBACCO-BASED THINGS ARE,ARE WONDER CARCINOGENS.
YOU'RE GOING TO KICK YOURSELFFOR NOT THINKING OF THIS FIRST.
HE NUKED THE TOBACCO IN 200WAL-MART MICROWAVES.
[LAUGHTER]TIRED OF FEELING BAD?
TRY SOME OF OUR HIGHLYIRRADIATED CIGARETTE PILLS.
[LAUGHTER]APPARENTLY IT TURNS OUT WHEN YOU
PUT TWO TERRIBLE THINGSTOGETHER, IT MAKES SOMETHING
GREAT.
GONORRHEA IS TERRIBLE, BUT WHENYOU MIX IT IN A CROCK POT WITH
DOG VOMIT, IT TRANSFORMS INTO AHEALTHY PART OF ANY CHILD'S
BREAKFAST.
MMM.
MMM.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]THAT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE COUNT
DRIPULA.
ALL RIGHT.
SO THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFEACCEPTED A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS WORTH OF GIFTS.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF THEYACTUALLY TRIED TO PROMOTE THIS
CRAZY DRUG.
>> THE GOVERNOR SET UP MEETINGSFOR MR. WILLIAMS WITH TOP STATE
OFFICIALS.
THE GOVERNOR AND FIRST LADYHOSTED AN EVENT AT THE
GOVERNOR'S MANSION.
ALSO APPEARED TO SHOW SOMEINTEREST IN ENCOURAGING PUBLIC
UNIVERSITIES TO CONDUCT CLINICALSTUDIES OF A CHEMICAL FOUND IN
THE SUPPLEMENT.
>> Jon: AND, OF COURSE,GOVERNOR MCDONNELL PERSONALLY
PUSHED THROUGH THE BILL CHANGINGVIRGINIA'S STATE FOOD TO
MARLBORO HOT POCKETS.
SOME SOLID EXAMPLES OF ANAPPARENT QUID PRO QUO.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING WEIRDER?
>> ON THE SAME DAY MCDONNELLENDORSED MITT ROMNEY FOR
PRESIDENT, MAUREEN McDONNELLALLEGEDLY PITCHED ROMNEY'S WIFE
ANN, CLAIMING WILLIAM'SPRODUCT COULD POTENTIALLY
CURE HER MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]>> Jon: K, THAT... THAT'S
[BLEEPED] UP.
HOW DO THOSE TWO LIVE WITHTHEMSELVES?
WELL, I GUESS IT'S EASY THANKSTO FORGETULEX, FROM THE MAKERS
OF ANTABLOC, THE HERBALSUPPLEMENT GUARANTEED TO WIPE
OUT THE MEMORY OF A TIME YOUTRIVIALIZED A WOMAN'S
DIBILITATING AND INCURABLEDISEASE SO THAT A WHACKED OUT
SUPPLEMENT HUCKSTER WOULD BUYYOU A WATCH.
FORGETULEX, IT'S MADE OF CRUSHEDUP HEROIN NEEDLES AND BEDBUGS.
SO THIS SEEMS LIKE ANOPEN-AND-SHUT AWFUL THING.
WHAT DO THE MCDONNELLS HAVE TOSAY IN THEIR DEFENSE?
>> ATTORNEYS FOR THEMCDONNELLS SAY THE COUPLE IS
INNOCENT.
THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEENCONSPIRING TO ABUSE THE OFFICE
BECAUSE THEIR MARRIAGE HADBROKEN DOWN AND THEY WERE BARELY
ON SPEAKING TERMS.
>> Jon: WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE TOBE HAPPILY MARRIED TO BE
CORRUPT, ALTHOUGH IT HELPS,LIKE INFAMOUSLY CORRUPT ITALIAN
PM SILVIO BERLUSCONIAND HIS WIFE OF 20 YEARS,
A LADY-SHAPED PILE OFCOCAINE AND GOLD.
OH, OH, THAT'S SOME GOOD BUNGABUNGA.
WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THATMCDONNELL'S MARRIAGE WAS EVEN
SOUR?
>> DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY THESTATE'S FIRST LADY HAD A CRUSH
ON JOHNNIE WILLIAMS.
>> JURORS SAW 1,200 PHONE CALLSAND TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN
MAUREEN AND WILLIAMS.
ON THE DAY OF THE 2011VIRGINIA EARTHQUAKE, SHE TEXTED
HIM, "I JUST FELT THE EARTHMOVE, AND I WASN'T HAVING SEX."
>> Jon: ALL CAPITALS.
SO WAS THE FIRST LADY OFVIRGINIA HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH
BUSINESSMAN JOHNNIE WILLIAMS?
>> JOHNNIE WILLIAMS SAIDTHAT THERE WAS NO ROMANTIC
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIMAND MAUREEN MCDONNELL.
HE SAID, "I DIDN'T KNOW SHEEVEN HAD ANY INTEREST IN ME
UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK."
>> Jon: WHAT, ARE THEY IN[BLEEPED] FOURTH GRADE?
WHAT IS THIS?
WILLIAMS DIDN'T PICK UP ON THESIGNALS, I GUESS BECAUSE HE'S A
CRAZY-EYED INVENTOR, GOT HISHEAD FILLED WITH SO MANY IDEAS
DOESN'T KNOW WHEN THE LADIES ARETRYING TO HIT HIM UP.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED ME.
I WAS JUST THINKING IF I PUT MYFARTS INTO A GEORGE FOREMAN
GRILL, MAYBE I CAN CURE LUPUS.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M AN INVENTOR!
[LAUGHTER]PLEASE DON'T TRY DOING THAT AT
HOME.
[LAUGHTER]WHY WOULD MRS. MCDONNELL LIE
ABOUT THIS?
>> MAUREEN MCDONNELL'S CHIEFOF STAFF TOLD F.B.I.
INVESTIGATORS MAUREENMCDONNELL WAS "A NUT BAG."
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: SOMEONE'S NOT GETTING
A REFERENCE LETTER.
HERE'S WHAT I REALLY DON'TUNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT, WHY IS
"NUT BAG" A TERM FOR CRAZY?
YOU GOT TO CARRY YOUR NUTS INSOMETHING, AND A BAG SEEMS AS
SENSIBLE A CONVEYANCE OBJECT ASANYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE CRAZY? EATING NUTSOUT OF A DIAPER, BUT YOU DON'T
HEAR PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT CRAZYPEOPLE, THAT GUY'S NUT DIAPER.
APPARENTLY I'M ALONE.
EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE ISLIKE, I EAT NUTS OUT OF A
DIAPER.
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITHTHAT.
THE POINT IS THIS: CLEARLY THEREAL VICTIM HERE IS BOB
McDONNELL BECAUSE IF THERE'SONE THING HE CARES ABOUT IS
FAMILY VALUES.
>> 34-YEAR-OLD McDONNELL WROTEHIS MASTERS THESIS ON FAMILY
VALUES.
HE SUGGESTED WORKING WOMEN ANDFEMINISTS WERE "DETRIMENTAL TO
THE FAMILY."
>> WE BELIEVE IN THE SANCTITY OFLIFE AND FAMILY AND MARRIAGE.
I THINK THESE ISSUES OF LIFE ANDFAMILY AND MARRIAGE KIND
OF DEFINE WHO YOU ARE ASA PEOPLE.
>> Jon: WOW, SO I GUESS BY YOUROWN DEFINITION YOU'RE A TERRIBLE
PERSON.
DON'T WORRY, THERE'S A CURE,LESSADOUCHE.
[LAUGHTER]IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DENOUNCING
YOUR OWN MARRIAGE IN AN ATTEMPTTO ESCAPE THE MASSIVE CORRUPTION
CHARGES FILED AGAINST YOU, YOUMAY HAVE NATURAL ETHICS
DEFICIENCY.
TREATED WITH LESSADOUCHE,IT'S MADE WITH ASBESTOS AND YOUR
PARENTS' DIVORCE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
