>> Jon: WELCOME TO"THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART!
OUR GUEST TONIGHT -- OH, MAN ISTHIS FELLA TALENTED, INCREDIBLY
TALENTED FELLA -- OSCAR ISAAC,FROM THE FILM "A MOST VIOLENT
YEAR," IS GOING TO BE HERE, BUTFIRST --
( APPLAUSE )THAT'S FOR ALL THE YOUNG KUWAITI
KIDS WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S ALL NATURAL JEW OIL,RIGHT THERE.
( LAUGHTER )BUT FIRST, AMERICA'S ELECTION
CAMPAIGNS HAVE BECOME INSANELYEXPENSIVE, BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO PRETEND TO REACH FOR YOURWALLET ANYMORE.
SOMEONE ELSE IS PICKING UP THETAB.
>> THE POLITICAL NETWORK, LED BYTHE KOCH BROTHERS, HAS PUT A
PRICE TAG ON ITS SPENDING PLANS.
>> $900 MILLION IN THE 2016CYCLE.
>> THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
>> Jon:  NOW, YOU MAY THINKTO YOURSELF, OH, THAT'S
( BLEEP ) UP. ( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE AREN'T THOSE GUYS GOINGTO WANT
SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE FORSPENDING THE GROSS NATIONAL
PRODUCT OF MANY COUNTRIES ON ONEELECTION CYCLE?
AND IS THE THING THAT THEY WANTCONTROL OVER THE LEVERS OF OUR
DEMOCRACY OR WOULD THEY SETTLEFOR HAND JOBS?
( LAUGHTER )( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELL, REST EASY! BECAUSE ONE OFTHE MEN, REST EASY
BECAUSE ONE OF THE MENWHO STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM THIS
CAMPAIGN SPENDING SAYS IT'SREALLY FINE.
>> THERE ARE A BUNCH OFDEMOCRATS WHO HAVE TAKEN AS
THEIR TALKING POINT THAT THEKOCH BROTHERS ARE THE NEXUS OF
ALL EVIL IN THE WORLD.
I THINK THAT IS GROTESQUE ANDOFFENSIVE.
THEY WANT TO SCARE PEOPLE BYPAINTING A PICTURE OF NEFARIOUS
BILLIONAIRES.
>> Jon:  WHEN IN FACTTHEY'RE THE PICTURE OF
BENEVOLENT GOD KINGS.
( LAUGHTER )ALL HAIL THE CLAMSHELL BROTHERS!
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE TED CRUZWOULD BE SPEAKING AT THIS
CONFERENCE, WHETHER ABILLION -- A BILLION DOLLARS
-- WHERE IS MY MONEY BIB?
REALLY, THE KOCHS' MONEY IS WAYMORE IMPRESSIVE THAN ANY OF THE
G.O.P. CANDIDATES SO FAR.
I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST HAVETHE $900 MILLION RUN FOR OFFICE.
HEY!
GIVE IT UP FOR THE NEXTPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
JOHNNY ACTUAL CASH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )LISTEN, I'M-- PLEASE.
ALL KIDDING ASIDE, I'M NOTWORRIED THAT MONEY IS GOING TO
CORRUPT OUR VAUNTED POLITICALSYSTEM.
AMERICA'S VALUES ARE TOO BEDROCKSOLID-- FREEDOM OF SPEECH,
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS-- THESEPRINCIPLES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF
OUR NATIONAL IDENTITY.
THEY WILL STAND STRONG NO MATTERHOW MUCH ECONOMIC POWER IS
HURLED AT THEM.
( BARKING )WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT, GIRL?
I'M TALKING ABOUT AMERICANVALUES BEING INCORRUPTIBLE,
GIRL.
( BARK )( LAUGHTER )
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?
SAUDI ARABIA IS IN TROUBLE?
DROP EVERYTHING, WE'VE GOT TO GONOW?
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA CUTTING SHORTA TRIP TO INDIA TODAY.
HE'S TRAVELING TO SAUDI ARABIATO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO THE
FAMILY OF KING ABDULLAH, WHODIED LAST WEEK.
>> Jon:  SO OBAMA CUT SHORTHIS INDIA TRIP TO JET OFF TO
SAUDI ARABIA.
INDIA WAS PROBABLY JUST BORINGHIM.
>> MR. OBAMA BECAME THE FIRSTAMERICAN TO SIT IN THE VIEWING
STAND FOR THE COUNTRY'S REPUBLICDAY PARADE.
>> DANCERS IN BLUE AND OTHERSCELEBRATING INDIAN SPACE
EXPLORATION WERE FOLLOWED BYTWIRLING BATONS, ORNAMENTIAL
UMBRELLAS, AND A CADRE OFCAMELS.
THE FINALE-- STUNT RIDERS ONMOTORCYCLES AND A FLY-OVER.
THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION SPOKEFOR ITSELF.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  HE GAVE THEGREATEST PARADE IN HISTORY--
( LAUGHTER )THE SAME RATING ROGER EBERT GAVE
TO "A TALE OF TWO KITTIES."
( LAUGHTER )ALL RIGHT, SO THEY HAD TO LEAVE
INDIA AND HEAD TO SAUDI ARABIA.
THEY WERE GOING TO PAY RESPECTSTO THE LATE KING WHO, FROM WHAT
I UNDERSTAND, LEFT BEHIND ASTIRRING LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS.
>> KING ADBULLAH WILL BEREMEMBERED AT HOME AS A
REFORMER.
>> AS MUCH AS A REFORMER CAN BEIN A COUNTRY THAT PUBLICLY
BEHEADS CRIMINALS, SENTENCESHUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO
LASHINGS, AND DEPRIVES WOMEN OFTHE RIGHT TO DRIVE.
>> Jon:  SO A REFORMER--LOWER CASE "R."
IT'S A LOWER CASE "R." IT'S ALOWER CASE "R."
IT'S LOWER.
IT'S REALLY LOWER.
GO-- I WOULD GO LOWER.
I CAN STILL SEE IT.
( LAUGHTER )I WOULD MAKE A VERY SMALL "R."
HE'S AN "EFORMER."
BUT REGARDLESS OF THE KING'SATTITUDE TOWARDS HIS OWN PEOPLE,
THE LATE KING DID HAVE A VERYSPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH US.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW THATARE QUITE CLOSE TO THE LATE KING
ADBULLAH, SAID THE KING COULDNOT STAND PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> Jon:  OH!
I GET IT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT'SA MUSLIM-- OH, NO, THAT COULDN'T
BE IT.
( LAUGHTER )I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T
LIKE EACH OTHER.
SO WHY, AGAIN, WAS THE PRESIDENTSO EAGER TO GO MOURN THIS FELLA?
>> THE SOURCE OF THE KING'SWEALTH AND POWER-- OIL, OF
COURSE,-- A FIFTH OF THE WORLD'SRESERVES, AND IT WAS LARGELY
KING ADBULLAH WHO DRAMATICALLYDROVE DOWN THE PRICE OF OIL, AND
WITH IT, THE COST OF AMERICANGASOLINE.
>> Jon:  I CAN'T STAY MAD ATYOU.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  AND YOU KNOW WHAT,THEN?
THAT MAKES THIS WHOLE THING SEEMLIKE CRAVEN SELF-INTEREST ON
AMERICA'S PART.
BUT NOTHING COULD BE FURTHERFROM THE TRUTH.
THAT'S NOT US.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT IF SAUDIARABIA IS REALLY ALLIES WITH US
OR IF THEY HATE US OR WHOSEHUMAN RIGHTS RECORD IS ABUSIER.
THIS IS ABOUT SOLIDARITY IN ADIFFICULT TIME.
IT'S LIKE IN FRANCE THIS MONTHWITH THE UNITY MARCH.
WE DROPPED EVERYTHING TOCHAMPION FREEDOM IN THE
FACE OF TERRORISM.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS A NO-SHOWAT YESTERDAY'S RALLY IN PARIS,
AS YOU KNOW. HE DIDN'T SEND AHIGH-LEVEL ENVOY EITHER.
>> INCLUDING ATTORNEY GENERALERIC HOLDER WHO WAS IN PARIS FOR
COUNTER-TERRORISM MEETINGS.
>> Jon:  OKAY, WE DIDN'T SENDANYBODY, BUT TO BE FAIR, IT
WAS EARLY JANUARY, AND OURNATION WAS HARD AT WORK...
PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMINGGROUNDHOG'S DAY CELEBRATIONS.
( LAUGHTER )JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, DID ANY
OTHER AMERICANS ATTEND THERIYADH EVENT?
>> THE PRESIDENT'S SAUDIDELEGATION WAS A WASHINGTON'S
WHO'S WHO, FROM SECRETARY OFSTATE JOHN KERRY, SENATOR JOHN
McCAIN, AND C.I.A. DIRECTORJOHN BRENNAN, TO FORMER
SECRETARIES OF STATESJAMES BAKER
AND CONDOLEEZZA RICE.
>> Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP )!
EVERYBODY.
LET'S SEE IF I CAN DO THE MATH.
SO OKAY SO BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIAAND FRANCE, THAT'S EVERYBODY.
MINUS NOBODY.
( LAUGHTER )CARRY THE WHAT THE ( BLEEP ).
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH, YOU KNOWWHAT?
WHO'D WANT TO GO TO GROSS PARISANYWAY WHEN YOU COULD GO TO--
( LAUGHTER )THE CITY OF...
IT'S A CITY.
AND JUST LOOK AT RIYADH'S EFFECTON NANCY PELOSI AND JOHN
McCAIN.
( LAUGHTER )APPARENTLY, THESE MOTHER
( BLEEP ) ONLY FIGHTHERE IN AMERICA.
( LAUGHTER )APPARENTLY, THE ONLY THING THAT
CAN BRING OUR DIVIDED POLITICALSYSTEM TOGETHER IS SAUDI ARABIA.
THEY REALLY ARE A STABILIZINGFORCE.
SO OBAMA LEAVING INDIA TO GO TOSAUDI ARABIA IS REALLY SENDING A
MESSAGE TO FRANCE.
YOU WANT US TO COME OVER ANDMARCH WITH YOU GUYS IN
SOLIDARITY?
FIND A WAY TO TURN THIS INTOTHIS.
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
