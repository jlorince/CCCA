SOLVING THE PROBLEM THEN.
BUT TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE SIZE
OF CONGRESS' BALL AND THE BILL'S
LACK OF THEM YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK
AT ANOTHER PROVISION DEALING
WITH SO-CALLED POLITICAL
INTELLIGENCE.
I'LL LET "60 MINUTES" EXPLAIN
USING FOOTAGE OF PEOPLE WHOSE
FACES HAVE BEEN SURGICALLY
REMOVED.
>> A WHOLE NEW TOTALLY
UNREGULATED $100 MILLION
INDUSTRY HAS GROWN UP IN
WASHINGTON CALLED POLITICAL
INTELLIGENCE.
IT EMPLOYS FORMER CONGRESSMEN
AND FORMER STAFFERS TO SCOUR THE
HALLS OF THE CAPITOL GATHERING
VALUABLE NONPUBLIC INFORMATION
THEN SELLING IT TO HEDGE FUNDS.
>> Jon: HEADLESS ZOMBIES!
ROAMING THE HALLS.
THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY OF
PARASITES JUST RIDING ON THE
BACKS OF OUR CONGRESS PEOPLE
LIKE TICKS ON A WATER BUFFALO OR
MICE ON AN EAGLE.
(LAUGHTER)
I'M BEING TOLD THAT WAS NOT HOW
MICE GET AROUND.
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE AT WORK.
A FIRM CALLED J.N.K. SECURITIES
SET UP A MEETING BETWEEN SEVERAL
HEDGE FUNDS AND SENATOR CHRIS
DODD, THE GUY THAT WROTE ALL THE
FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
THE SENATOR TOLD THEM HE
WOULDN'T BE PURSUING A PRO
VISION TO CAP DEBIT CARD FEES.
NO ONE OUTSIDE THE MEETING HAS
THE INFORMATION.
THEN ONE OF THE HEDGE FUNDS THAT
WAS THERE BOUGHT OVER 300,000
SHARES IN VISA.
HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF THE
SAME TYPE OF ACTIVITY HAPPENS IN
THE REGULAR NON-CONGRESS
ECONOMY.
>> PRIMARY GLOBAL SALES MANAGER
JAMES FLEISCHMAN GUILTY OF
CONSPIRACY IN AN INSIDER TRADING
CASE.
>> SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION FILED SUIT AGAINST
ANGLO MA ZILLO, FORMER HEAD OF
COUNTRYWIDE MORTGAGE ACCUSING
HIM OF INSIDER TRADING AND
FRAUD.
>> A FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR OF
THE NASDAQ HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
INSIDER TRADING.
>> I FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS BOARD
MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
INSIDER TRADING.
>> SENTENCED TO 11 YEARS IN
PRISON, THE HARSHEST PUNISHMENT
EVER FOR AN INSIDER TRADING
CASE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHO I BET
FINDS THE JUXTAPOSITION OF WHAT
CONGRESS PEOPLE CAN DO AND
REGULAR PEOPLE CAN DO
HYSTERICAL?
MARTHA STEWART.
I BET SHE'S JUST LAUGHING AND
LAUGHING AS SHE TAKES A
RECLAIMED BARN WOOD BASEBALL
FOOT A SHELF FULL OF VASES SHE
RAFTD FROM RECYCLED NEW ENGLANDC
LOBSTER TRAPS.
(LAUGHTER)
SHE'S MAD.
THE SENATE VERSION OF THE STOCK
ACT DEALT WITH THESE POLITICAL
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE.
IT DIDN'T BAN THEM FROM
SHUTTLING INFORMATION FROM
CONGRESS TO HEDGE FUNDS BUT IT
DID REQUIRE THEM TO DO ONE
THING.
>> IT TAKES THESE PEOPLE THAT
YOU CALL POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE
PROFESSIONALS AND HAVE THEM
REGISTER JUST LIKE EVERY
LOBBYIST REGISTERS SO IT'S
TOTALLY TRANSPARENT SO WHEN
THESE PEOPLE COME AROUND TO GET
INFORMATION FROM YOU THAT THEY
SELL TO HEDGE FUNDS...
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE
GOING TO MAKE THEM REGISTER LIKE
LOBBYISTS.
NOW THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET
IN AND SEE CONGRESS PEOPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
EXCEPT ALWAYS.
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.
DOES GIVE IT A LITTLE
TRANSPARENCY.
WHO COULD OBJECT TO THAT?
>> HOUSE REPUBLICANS REJECTED A
PROVISION THAT REQUIRES
SO-CALLED POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE
FIRMS TO REGISTER THE SAME AS
LOBBYISTS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR TAKING
(BLEEP) ON OUR CHESTS.
NOW TO BE FAIR THE OPPONENTS OF
REGISTERING POLITICAL OPERATIVES
HAD A GOOD POINT.
>> THINK OF THE WORDING
"POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE."
THERE'S SO MUCH QUESTION ABOUT
WHAT THAT MEANS.
>> POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE IS
DEFINED AS INFORMATION WHICH IS
INTENDED FOR USE IN ANALYZING
SECURITIES OR COMMODITY MARKETS
OR INFORMING INVESTMENT
DECISIONS.
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> Jon: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
YOU WROTE THE (BLEEP) THING!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DOES IT
MEAN?
YOU WROTE IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
REALLY, LIEBERMAN?
(AS LIEBERMAN)
POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE, ARE
THOSE EVEN WORDS?
WHEN I SEE THE COLOR BLUE, DO I
KNOW YOU'RE SEEING THE SAME
COLOR I'M SEEING?
I MEAN, WHAT IF CONGRESS IS JUST
LIKE THE DREAM OF A SLEEPING
BUTTERFLY?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU WRITE LAWS, NOT POETRY.
BUT SUDDENLY SENATORS SOUND LIKE
ENGLISH PROFESSORS.
WELL, THAT SENTENCE, WHAT DOES
IT MEAN TO YOU?
(LAUGHTER)
HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT MEANS,
"PACK YOUR SHUTES, PEOPLES, NO
