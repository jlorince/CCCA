>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".
MY SAME IN JON STEWART.
WE HAVE -- MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
SEESTEPHEN MERCHANT WILL BE ON THE
SHOW TONIGHT.
WHEN HIS PARTNER RICKY GERVAIS
WAS HERE WE HAD A REFINED
CONVERSATION WITH RACCOON AND
PANDA SEX SO DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'LL TALK ABOUT TONIGHT.
BUT YOU MAY WANT TO LEAVE THE
ROOM WHEN WE DO.
I'M GOING TO SAY ROMNEY WON
ARIZONA HANDELLY BUT THE BIG
RESULT WAS MICHIGAN WHERE ALL
FOUR CANDIDATES WERE DEFEATED BY
A LATE SURPRISE ENTRANCE THE
SCHITCY WHEN FROM I UNDERSTAND
HE MADE IMPRESSIVE PROMISES.
>> WHEN YOU ORDER THE SCHITKY
YOU GET THE LITTLE ONE.
>> Jon: IT'S A POPULOUS
MESSAGE THAT RESONATES IN THE
DIFFICULT YET SCHMOOTZY TIMES.
ROMNEY KEPT PUTTING HIS FOOT IN
THE MOUTH HE HIRED SEW OWN MOUTH
DOESN'T GET FEET IN IT AND
SANTORUM RELEASED A ROBO CALL
TELLING DEMOCRATIC VOTERS TO
VOTE FOR HIM SINCE MICHIGAN'S
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS OPEN TO ALL
VOTERS AND MITT ROMNEY DIDN'T
CARE FOR THE TACTIC.
>> OUTRAGEOUS AND DISGUSTING.
IT'S A NEW LOW IN THIS CAMPAIGN.
I THINK RICK SANTORUM HAS A LOT
OF EXPLAINING TO DO.
>> Jon: YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
SPLAINING TO DO, THE CLOSE ET HE
WILL GET TO THE IT WILL TINO
VOTE.
WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THE TAPE
EXISTING OF MITT ROMNEY
ENDORSING THAT VERY SAME
PRACTICE, PERHAPS MY MITT ROMNEY
FLIP-FLOP FINDER --
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- KNOWS THE ANSWER.
>> IN MASSACHUSETTS IF YOU
REGISTER AS AN INDEPENDENT, YOU
CAN VOTE IN EITHER THE
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY.
WHEN THERE WAS NO REAL CONTEST
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY I
WOULD VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRAT,
VOTE FOR THE PERSON I THOUGHT
WOULD BE THE WEAKEST OPPONENT
FOR A REPUBLICAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: WHAT A DISGUSTING
THING TO DO.
YOU HAVE SOME SPLAINING TO DO.
WOW.
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS THING WAS
ONLY $10 AT TARGET.
LOOK, NOW FLIP-FLOP FINDER WE
HAVE ROMNEY FLIP-FLOPPING ON THE
SUBSTANCE BUT IN THE CLIP WITH
SANTORUM HE CALLED THIS PRACTICE
DISGUSTING.
DO YOU HAVE A CLIP OF ROMNEY
PERHAPS FROM HIS PAST NOT ONLY
ADMITTING TO THIS PRACTICE OF
VOTING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S PRIMARY
BUT ADMITTING IT IN A
12-YEAR-OLD GLEEFUL GIRLY VOICE.
PROBABLY NO WHAT I NEW YORK CITY
WHAMMIES.
>> WHEN YOU REGISTER AS A
INDEPENDENT YOU COULD VOTE
AGAINST BILL CLINTON.
I USED TO VOTE AGAINST TED
KENNY.
>> Jon: I USED TO VOTE AGAINST
TED KENNEDY [SQUEALING] HE HAS
AN ADRENALIN RUSH.
WHO NEEDS PARTYING OR CURSING
WHEN YOU HAVE CROSS PARTY
ENDORSING.
I'LL BE UP ALL NIGH
