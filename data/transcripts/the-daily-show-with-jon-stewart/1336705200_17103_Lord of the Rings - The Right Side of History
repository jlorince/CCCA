MILE IF GAY AMERICA'S SHOES.
(LAUGHTER) SINCE IT WAS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR OBAMA'S PRESIDENT I'M SURE FOX NEWS WAS
[BLEEP] AN ASSAULT ON TRADITIONAL VALUES.
>> WHAT MI MOST CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHETHER REPUBLICAN WAS GO OUT ON A LIMB AND TRY
TO PAGE THIS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE WHILE SITTING VERY FIRMLY WITH WITHOUT MUCH
QUESTION ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY ON IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: JEFF SMITH JEFF SMITH, COME ON, FOX, IT'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
THE MOST DIVISIVE CULTURAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME, REMEMBER?
>> THERE IS A GAY AND SECULAR FASCISM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO IMPOSE
ITS WILL ON THE REST OF US.
>> IF YOU CHANGE THE VARIABLES AND SAY THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MAN AND
A WOMAN T CAN BE A WOMAN AND WOMAN AND MAN AND WOMAN.
>> WHY NOT A PAN AND WOMAN AND WOMAN AND WOMAN, IT MAY SOUND CRAZY.
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE BUT HERE YOU GO.
THIS IS THE SLIPPERY SLOPE.
IF YOU LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE AND GAY SEX AND ALL OF THAT,
THEN ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO MARRY FIVE PEOPLE CAN DO IT,
YOU CAN MARRY A TURTLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BILL, SEE, FOX, YOU USED TO THINK GAY MARRIAGE WOULD END WITH ALL OF US
MARRYING TURTLES, WHICH,
INCIDENTALLY, YOU THINK WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR TO SUPPORT IT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> HEY, MY NAME IS MITCH-- WHY DON'T YOU MARRY ME AND WE CAN MOVE RIGHT
INTO MY HOUSE, I KEEP IT ON MY BACK.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: COME ON, THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTING AN ATTACK ON THE INSTITUTION OF
MARRIAGE, AND CHRISTIAN VALUES.
GAY PEOPLE CAUSE HEUER KARNTION REMEMBER.
>> THISES WITH ALL ABOUT POLITICS AS USUAL, NOT PRINCIPLES.
>> THIS IS ABOUT GETTING RE-ELECTED IN NOVEMBER.
>> FROM THE POLITICAL STANDPOINT, IT SMELLS BAD.
>> THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY DRIVING THIS.
IT IS ALL ABOUT POLITICS AND IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.
>> AND THIS IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME AS A NATION.
IN LIKE FIVE YEARS THE PRIME TALKING POINT FROM REPUBLICANS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO
SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE HAS GONE FROM IT WILL DESTROY SOCIETY VIA [BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER) TO OH, OF COURSE YOU'RE FOR IT YOU'LL SAY ANYTHING POPULAR TO GET RE-ELECTED.
(LAUGHTER)
