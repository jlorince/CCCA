CAOI.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DID COST US AT THE SHOW
$2 BILLION.
ANYWAY.
IT'S NOT FAIR THAT CHINA
GETS ALL THAT-- BLACK GOLD,
LIQUID-- IT'S LIKE IRAQ IS A
SLOT-- PORTER AFTER FOR
OTHERS KNOWING THAT ANY
MINUTE IRAQ IS GOING TO PAY
OFF, SAYING WE HAVE TO GET
UP TO THE BATHROOM AND DYING
TO SIT DOWN AND BOOM.
BLAAAAHHHH!
I'M SORRY, COULD WE STOP
THAT?
WHAT ARE THOSE, OIL BISCUITS?
WHAT WERE THOSE?
I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU,
IRAQ.
I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU,
CHINA.
WE INVADE IRAQ AND CHINA
GETS SPOILS NOT TO MENTION
ALL THAT SWEET MADE IN CHINA
YELLOW RIBBON MAGNET MONEY.
THEY GET IT EVERY WHICH WAY.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT IS MORE IRONIC THAN
THAT.
>> CHINA OPPOSED THE
LIBERATION OF IRAQ AND TRIED
TO ARMED SADDAL HUSSEIN
REGIME.
>> CHINA.
THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN
TO HURT US, BUT WE STILL END
UP HELPING THEM.
THEY'RE LIKE A BANK OF
AMERICA-- IF BANK OF AMERICA
WAS A COUNTRY.
(APPLAUSE)
HOW DID WE NOT SEE THIS
COMING?
>> THE WAR IS LIKE A DARK
ROOM WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
GOING TO END UP.
>> YES, I BELIEVE THOSE WERE
THE WORDSES OF DECORATED
GENERAL-- YEAH, I BELIEVE
THAT ALSO ACCURATELY
DESCRIBED THE PARTY AT-- BUT
THE POINT IS THIS, REALLY?
WE'RE DOING JOKES ABOUT THE
WAR IN IRAQ, PEOPLE DYING
AND LIKE WHOOO!
ANDY DICK'S HOUSE-- I
THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING.
--
>> HELPING THE IRAQ PEOPLE
REBUILD THEIR CIVIL SOCIETY.
AND THE FREE INSTITUTIONS
THAT SUSTAIN A DEMOCRACY.
>> PRIOR DIFFICULTIES IRAQ
DOES HAVE AN EMERGING FREE
MARKET WITH AN INDEPENDENT
CENTRAL BANK, AND THOUSANDS
OF SMALL BUSINESSES
OPERATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> ALL RIGHT, THOSE ARE OUR
VALUES.
WE GOT INTO IRAQ, IT TURNS
OUT WE SHOW THAT-- THE IT
SEEMS IF THE WAR HAD ANOTHER
WINNER THAT WOULD BE US.
>> THE WINNER OF THE IRAQ
WAR WAS FRANCE.
>> SON OF A BITCH!
I'M STARTING THIS THING THIS
WHOLE IRAQ-- WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
