COME ON.
WE'RE TIRED!
FOR THE MOST PART, THE NEWS NAEKS ACQUITTED THEMSELVES NICELY WITH LITTLE OF THE EARLY
CALLED CONTROVERSY AND MALFUNCTIONS OF YEARS PAST, EXCEPT B.M.N., BULL ( BLEEP )
MOUNTAIN NEWS, WHO WERE CAUGHT FLAT FOOT BIDE A HISTORIC STORM DID SPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE JUST
DAYS BEFORE, THEY NEVER SAW COMING.
>> I THINK MITT ROMNEY IS GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION.
>> IT JUST IS A MOMENTUM.
>> I THINK THAT MITT ROMNEY WILL WIN.
>> WE'RE GOING TO WIN BY A LANDSLIDE.
>> THEY'RE SCIEWD.
YOU CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE SCIENTIFIC GOBBLEDEGOOK YOU LIKE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THEM.
>> Jon:  THIS WAS THE HISTORIC ELECTION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC GOBBLEDEGOOK, OR AS
WE CALL IT, ARITHMETIC.
( LAUGHTER ) AND BELIEF, BELIEF WAWNS GOING DOWN OUT A FIGHT WHICH LED TO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU.
NOW, ( LAUGHTER ) MY FRIEND, EVENTUALLY SOME DAY I WILL DIE, AS WILL YOU, AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW AND LOVE.
BUT THIS SEGMENT FROM FOX NEWS ELECTION COVERAGE TAKEN AT THE PRECISE MOMENT THEIR INTERNAL
RESEARCH SQUAD ANNOUNCED OHIO AND THE PRESIDENCY WOULD BE AWARDED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, I
BELIEVE THIS FOOT ANNUAL, UPLIKE US, WILL LIVE FOREVER.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE OHIO HAS BEEN SETTLED?
>> NO, I DON'T AND LOOK IF-- IF WE ARE CALLING THIS ON THE BASIS OF 47% OF THE VOTE BEING IN AND
WHEN 77% IS IN SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THE-- I GOT THE DIRECTOR OF THE OHIO CAMPAIGN
FOR ROMNEY ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE REFRESHING THE PAGE EVERY FEW SECONDS.
>> Jon:  GO ON...
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A REPUBLICAN VICTORY.
THIS IS A HISTORIC REPUBLICAN COUNTY.
THER TARGET IS 64.
THEY'RE AT 59 WITH BASICALLY, THE EARLY VOTE COUNTED.
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO EDGE UP.
>> BIG SWATCHES OF BUTLER COUNTY, DELAWARE COUNTY, AND WARREN COUNTY, ALL OF WHICH ARE
REPUBLICAN COUNTIES WHICH HAVE BIG CHUNKS OF THE VOTE OUT.
>> IS THIS JUST MATH YOU DO AS A REPUBLICAN TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER OR IS THIS REAL?
>> Jon:  DID YOU CATCH THAT!
DID DID YOU CATCH THAT RIGHT?
THERE?
THAT THE THE MOMENT.
DID YOU RECORD IT AND TIVO IT.
YOU CAN PLAY IT BACK WARDS AND FORWARD ALL DAY.
I JUST WANT TO GET IT STRAIGHT, KARL, VERY QUICKLY-- ARE YOU LYING TO YOURSELF OR TO THE
MILLIONS OF VIEWERS 'CAUSE YOU'RE LIEIN' BY THE WAY, MACT YOU DO AS A REPUBLICAN TO MAKE
YOURSELF FEEL BETTER IS A MUCH BETTER SLOGAN FOR FOX THAN THE ONE THEY HAVE NOW.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU KNOW-- DELICIOUS.
LIKE WHEN TRUMAN BURBANK FIRST SUSPECTED THE WORLD HE'D BEEN LIVING IN WAS NOT WHAT IT
SEEMED, DISCOVERY WOULD TAKE A VOYAGE.
>> KARL ROVE SAID THAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DEAL IS WITH THIS DECISION DESK.
THE DECISION DESK IS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.
MEGYN, I WILL ESCORT YOU DOWN THE STEPS HERE.
MEGYN IS GOING TO GO TO THE DECISION DESK AND INTERVIEW THEM ABOUT THE DECISION ON OHIO.
>> Jon:  THIS WAS 10 THAT-- THEN THAT MEGYN KELLY, IN PURSUIT OF SOMETHING CALLED
FACTS, LEFT THE HOLODECK AND ENTERED THE WORLD OF DUNDER MIFFLIN.
>> WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE AMOUNT OF RAW VOTE THAT'S IN THESE COUNTIES THAT'S OUT THERE
STILL WAITING TO COME IN IS SO LARGE, NO MATTER WHAT THE HAND FULL OF REPUBLICAN PRECINCTS
THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE, IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.
>> 100% CERTAINTY.
>> 99.95%.
>> Jon:  SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LAST NIGHT, TRAGICALLY, THERE WAS AN AVALANCHE ON BULL
( BLEEP ) MOUNTAIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WITH THE BLAME FOR IT IF TO THEIR OWN WILLFUL BLINDNESS?
THEIR A SUPPER OF MISINFORMATION GRUEL THEY THEMSELVES COOKED UP AND HAD TO AT SOME DEEP LEVEL OF
COGNITION KNOW CONTAINED FAR MORE THAN OF THE F.D.A.
ALLOWANCE OF BULL ( BLEEP )?
>> THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IS NOW THE MINORITY.
>> I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE, THOUGH, THAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD BELIEVE THAT
INCURRING MORE DEBT IS GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY, FOR OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE, FOR JOB CREATORS.
>> IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL AMERICA ANYMORE, AND THERE ARE 50% OF THE VOTING PUBLIC WHO
WANT STUFF.
>> I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD BELIEVE THAT IT'S OKAY NOT TO
FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT HAVE A BUDGET.
>> WHO IS GOING TO GIVE THEM THINGS?
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THINGS.
( LAUGHTER ).
( BOOING ).
>> Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP ) BALLS.
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO TELL YOURSELVES.
"WE WOULD HAVE WON IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE MORAL FAILINGS OF THE THE NONE REAL AMERICA.
IT'S WHITE PEOPLE JUDO." FOX LOST BECAUSE LAST NIGHT MINORITIES WHO FEEL ENTITLED TO
THINGS, CAME AND TOOK THE COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE SELF-SUFFICIENCY, WHITE MEDICARE
RETIREES AND UPPER CLASS TAX-AVOIDANCE EXPERTS, OR AS THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN-- YOUR AUDIENCE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
