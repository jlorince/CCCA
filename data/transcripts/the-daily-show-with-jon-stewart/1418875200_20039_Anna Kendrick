THAT, YOU KNOW, THE SCENE ISCOMING UP AND IT'S SORT OF
LIKE BEING, YOU KNOW, IF YOUWERE PLAYING A RUNNER IN A MOVIE
YOU WOULD BE STRETCHING ANDSTUFF, SORT OF STAYING WARM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND YOU'RE, YOU ARESUPPOSED TO SORT OF KEEP YOUR
VOICE WARM SO YOU AREDOING ALL THESE --
LIKE THESE WEIRD LIKE VOCALSILLY EXERCISES.
FOR YOUR VOICE TO STAY WARM.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RETELLING PEOPLE?
>> YES. AND SOME OF THE, SOMEOF THE LIKE THE CREW MEMBERS
WOULD HEAR ME, I WOULD JUST BESORT OF SITTING, YOU KNOW,
WAITING TO GO SHOOT A SCENE ANDGO HA, HMMMM, AND THEY
WOULD BE LIKE ANNA, CAN WE GETYOU SOMETHING?
LIKE I'M, LIKE I'M, LIKE I'MREALLY BAD AT BEING EXASPERATED.
LIKE I'M NEW TO PASSIVEAGGRESSION.
AND I'M LIKE -- IT'S REALLYCOLD IN THIS ROOM.
I WILL HAVE A WATER.
>> Jon: THAT WAS JUST A WAY,LIKE A HUM. YOU JUST GO --
I COULD USE A LITTLE WATER BUTINSTEAD YOU MAKE A NOISE.
BUT-- DO THEY -- DO YOU HAVETO SING IT EVERY TAKE OR IS
THAT A TRACK, HOW DO THEYFILM SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
>> WE DID A LITTLE BIT OFBOTH.
SO THERE ARE SCENES WHEREI'M SINGING LIVE AND THAT
WAS REALLY GREAT.
BUT I AM IN A VERY, VERYLEGITIMATE CORSET SO SOME OF
THAT STUFF WHERE I'M RUNNING UPAND DOWN THE STAIRS, I JUST
I CAN'T SING SONG ON TIME IN ACORSET RUNNING UP AND DOWN
REAL STEPS.
>> Jon: CAN'T THEY DO THAT --LIKE DO THEY REALLY HAVE TO LACE
YOU INTO, CAUSE THOSE ARE LIKEA TORTURE DEVICE.
>> NO JOKE. OH YEAH, AND YOU'RESTUCK IN THERE AND IT IS, IT'S
LIKE BEING TEMPORARILYASTHMATIC SO JUST --
>> Jon: YOU JUST,  YOU CAN'TGET A BREATH.
>> THE SIMPLEST THINGSBECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
DIFFICULT.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND THERE WAS-- YOU KNOWTHAT THING WHEN ARE YOU A
LITTLE KID, AND SOMEBODY ISTICKLING YOU AND IT'S REALLY
FUN AND SUDDENLY ARE YOUSCREAMING FOR MERCY?
AND THIS WAS-- THERE WAS ADAY THAT CHRIS PINE, CHRIS
PINE IS SO FUNNY IN THISMOVIE AND HE WAS MAKING
ME LAUGH ON SET.>> Jon: YEAH.

EMERGENCY.
>> WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TOBE THE GIRL WHO CRIED WOLF,
I GUESS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. NO, YOU JUST WANTTO BE THE GIRL WITHOUT MAKES
WEIRD NOISES AND WANTSWATER.
THE THING ABOUT, THOUGH, THESINGING, WHAT IS THE
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FROM ACREW, LIKE BECAUSE ACTING
AFTER A SCENE, YOU DON'THAVE TO APPLAUD.
BUT TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWINGA SONG, YOU SHOULD APPLAUD.
DOES THE CREW AT A CERTAINPOINT GO SURE, OKAY?
