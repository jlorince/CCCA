>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
THE ACTRESS OLIVIA WILDE, STAR OF THE NEW MOVIE "BUTTER" WILL BE HERE.
SHE'S GOING TO CHURN UP.
. . SOME.
. . EXCITEMENT.
(LAUGHTER) I HATE MYSELF.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A CRISIS ROCKING THIS NATION.
>> A HUGE OUTCRY, MILLIONS TALKING ABOUT IT, TWEETING, FACEBOOKING ABOUT IT, IT'S GONE VIRAL.
>> THE TWO SIDES ARE LOCKED BASICALLY IN THIS LABOR DISPUTE.
>> Jon: A LABOR DISPUTE!
YES, AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF THE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FACTORY AND THE PINKERTON BOYS.
A LABOR DISPUTE HAS ONCE AGAIN TAUGHT AMERICANS ABOUT THE IRREPLACEABLE VALUE OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN.
>> CHICAGO STANDOFF.
TEACHERS NOW SAY THEY WILL NOT BE BACK TODAY AS THEIR STRIKE ENTERS ITS SECOND WEEK.
>> Jon: NOT THAT LABOR DISPUTE.
(LAUGHTER) IRREPLACEABLE WORKING MEN!
NOT LAZY PUBLIC SECTOR-- FATTENED ON GIFT APPLES AND LOUNGING IN THEIR FACULTY LOUNGES WITH THEIR CHALKY
FINGERS AND MUGS!
(LAUGHTER) ALL OF WHICH PROCLAIM THEY TO BE THE WORLD'S GREATEST TEACHER!
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!
(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK I PULLED AN ABOUT MALL MULL.
(LAUGHTER) I'M TALKING ABOUT REAL WORKERS!
>> 2,000 WORKERS IN CHINA TOOK TO THE STREETS.
FOXCONN HAS FACED CHARGES OF POOR WORKING CONDITIONS, LOW PAY AND MANDATORY OVERTIME IN THE PAST.
THE FACTORY THAT WAS THE SITE OF RIOTS REPORTEDLY MAKES CASES FOR THE IPHONE 5.
>> Jon: OH, FRUIT, YOU CAN'T ESCAPE MY BLADES OF NINJA.
(LAUGHTER) OH, FRUIT YOU ARE NO-- (LAUGHTER).
SORRY, YOU WAS JUST PLAYING FRUIT NINJA WHO-- WHOEVER MAKES THESE DOES AN AWESOME JOB.
I HOPE THEY'RE WELL PAID.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
YES, A LABOR DISPUTE THAT AFFECTS AMERICANS.
>> THE N.F.L.'S REPLACEMENT REFEREES LITERALLY DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF AT LEAST ONE GAME.
>> THIS IS A CAR CRASH IN MOTION HERE.
>> AWFUL!
DISGUSTING!
DISAPPOINTING!
>> I WAS HEARTBROKEN.
>> HEARTBROKEN.
>> IT IS TIME TO BRING THE REFS BACK TO THE N.F.L.
>> Jon: YES!
THE MEDIA HAS FINALLY TAKEN A STAND ON AN ISSUE OF THIS DAY AND SAID LET'S BRING OUR BOYS HOME!
(LAUGHTER) BRING THEM HOME TO THE N.F.L.
BECAUSE-- MR. GOODELL, TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!
(SPEAKING GERMAN) LOOK, AMERICA FINALLY LEARNED WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO QUICKLY SET AL LABOR DISPUTE, A BLOWN
OFF INTERFERENCE CALL AND AN INTERCEPTION THAT NOT ONLY COST THE GREEN BAY PACKERS A VICTORY IT COST ONE UNNAMED AMERICAN WHO
HAD TAKEN THE PACKERS WHILE GIVING THE POINT $200 IN ONE WEEK FOR ONE WEEK WEARING ONLY A SEATTLE SEAHAWKS JERSEY AND A THONG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THAT IS CLEARLY SOMEONE ELSE'S BODY.
(LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT-- (LAUGHTER) IF THAT WAS-- HONESTLY, IF THAT WAS A PICTURE OF ME IT WAS LOOK
LIKE A GIBBON WEARING A JERSEY.
(LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- I DON'T KNOW WHO HE GOT AS A STAND-IN BUT-- (LAUGHTER).
I HAVE-- DO YOU KNOW-- I HAVE SO MUCH HAIR ON MY ASS THAT BLUR NEVER WOULD HAVE IN ANY WAY-- (LAUGHTER).
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ONLY ONE SIDE.
THE OTHER SIDE IS RELATIVELY LOSING HAIR.
WHAT I DO IS I COMB IT OVER.
(LAUGHTER) BUT WHILE MOST AMERICANS RIGHTFULLY TIE THIS MISSED CALL AND GREEN BAY LOSS DIRECTLY TO THE N.F.L. LABOR DISPUTE, SOME
HAVE FOUND A DEEPER RESONANCE.
>> THAT WAS AN INTERCEPTION.
THIS WAS NOT A TOUCHDOWN.
AND, LIKE I SAID THIS MORNING, WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE TEMPORARY REFS JUST LIKE WE NEED TO REPLACE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) AND HAVE REAL REFS AND REAL LEADERS FIX THIS--
>> Jon: WHAT THE HELL?
HOW DID YOU COMBINE THE-- YOU CAN TIE ANY SITUATION, I GUESS, INTO THAT.
"YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD JERRY SANDUSKY IS GOING TO PRISON.
BUT YOU KNOW THE PERSON REALLY RAPING AMERICA'S CHILDREN IS PRESIDENT OBAMA WITH
