( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, BESTSELLINGAUTHOR, THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED
"THE BULLY PULPIT."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, IJUST WANT TO SAY THANKS A LOT.
BUSY ALL DAY, DOING ALL KIND OFWORK I HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH
THIS-- TWO AND A HALF MILLIONPAGES.
>> IT'S THINNER THAN "LINCOLN."
>> IT IS THINNER THAN "LINCOLN."
BUT THAT HAD A TEAM OF RIVALS.
>> THIS HAS A CAST OFCHARACTERS.
>> IT HAS A CAST OFCHARACTERS BUT IT'S TAFT, TEDDY
ROOSEVELT AND THE JOURNALISTS.
THE BOOK IS "THE BULLY PULPIT."
TWO GUYS WEARING MUSTACHES WHENTHEY WERE AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF
EXPRESSION.
TAFT AND ROOSEVELT WERE THICK ASTHIEVES, AND THE WHOLE
RELATIONSHIP FALLS APART WHENTHEY FIGHT EACH OTHER FOR THE
PRESIDENCY.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
I MEAN, I DIDN'T-- ALL I KNEWWAS THAT TEDDY WAS THE ONE I
WANTED TO STUDY BECAUSE HE WASIN A TIME WHEN POLITICAL LEADERS
FOUGHT FOR THINGS, WHEN THEJOURNALISTS HAD A MISSION AND A
CALL, WHEN THE COUNTRY WASRIGHTING ANCIENT WRONGS.
THAT'S THE KIND OF ERA I WANT TOLIVE IN.
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE GUYSFOR SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE IT TAKES
ME SO LONG AND I NEEDED AN ANGLEOTHER THAN TEDDY AND IT TURNS
OUT TAFT HAD A REALLY DEEPFRIENDSHIP.
TEDDY SAID, "MY BELOVED TAFT."
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON BETWEENTHESE TWO.
THE FAMILIES LIVED NEXT TO EACHOTHER.
TEDDY HAND PICKED HIM TO BE HISSUCCESSOR IN 1908, RAN HIS
CAMPAIGN, TOLD HIM, "DON'T PLAYGOLF.
IT'S A WORKING MAN'S GAME."
TAFT HAD A SONG ♪ GET ON A RAFT WITH TAFT."
TAFT WEIGHED 350 POUNDS.
IT WOULD BE A DUBIOUSPROPOSITION.
>> Jon:  EVEN IF TAFT WASNOT HEAVY, I FEEL LIKE "GET ON A
RAFT WITH TAFT."
>> IT RHYMES, RIGHT?
>> Jon:  IT DOES RHYME.
>> IT DOES RHYME.
ANYWAY, HE RUNS HIS CAMPAIGN.
HE'S SO HAPPY WHEN HE WINS,THINKS HE'LL CARRY OUT MY
LEGACY, AND THEN HE GOES TOAFRICA COMES BACK, AND FEELS
TAFT IS NOT AS PROGRESSIVE AS HEWANTED AND HE ALSO WANTED TO GET
BACK IN THE GAME.
HE LOVED POLITICS AND RUNSAGAINST HIM IN 1912 AND IT GETS
REALLY UGLY.
IT MAKES ME SAD.
HE CALLS TAFT A FAT HEAD ANDSAYS HE HAS THE BRAIN OF A
GUINEA PIG AND TAFT SAID HE'S ADICTATOR AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP,
NEEDLESS TO SAY, BREAKS APART.
>> Jon:  AND THEY CHANGED ITTO
♪ DON'T RUN FOR TAFTHE'LL GIVE YOU THE SHAFT."
TEDDY ROOSEVELT REALLY WENTAFTER HIM.
>>>> Jon:  WHAT I FOUND SO
FASCINATING IN OUR CURRENTVERNACULAR OF REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS AND THINGS LIKE THIS,AND THE HOPE AND INSPIRATION OF
WHAT FREE PEOPLE CAN DO WHENTHEY GET TOGETHER AND FORM
GOVERNMENTS, AND FORM-- IS THATTHEY-- TEDDY ROOSEVELT,
ESPECIALLY HAD THIS VISION OFPUBLIC POLICY THAT IS TODAY, I
THINK, WOULD BE CONSIDEREDCOMMUNIST.
>> RIGHT.
AND HERE HE IS A REPUBLICAN.
HE'S DRAGGING A RELUCTANTREPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO PASS
LEGISLATION TO HELP WORKMEN'SCOMPENSATION, GET CHILDREN OUT
OF FACTORIES, BREAK UP THE BIGTRUSTS.
THE WAY HE DID IT WAS HE HAD AREMARKABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
PRESS.
HE LET THEM IN WHEN HE WASSHAVING, HE HAD THE BARBER'S
HOUR -->> THAT WAS WEIRD.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, HEWOULD TAKE WALKS WITH
JOURNALISTS AND AMBASSADORS ANDHE WOULD TALK THE WHOLE TIME AND
HE WENT THROUGH THE PARK, ANDIF-- YOU COULDN'T GO OVER AN
OBSTACLE.
IF YOU HAD A ROCK, YOU HAD TO GOOVER IT.
IF IT WAS A PRECIPICE, YOUHAD TO GO DOWN IT.
THERE'S ONE AMBASSADOR WHOTHINKS-- HE'S DYING IN THE PARK.
THEY FINALLY GET TO A STREAM ANDHE THINKS THANK GOD IT'S OVER.
AND TED SAID, WE BETTER UNDRESSBECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CROSS THE
STREAM.
HE SAID FOR THE HONOR OF FRANCEI
TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES AND GOT TOTHE OTHER SIDE.
AND TED SAID WHY DO YOU HAVE ONTHESE LAVENDER GLOVES.
AND HE SAID YOU NEVER KNOW.
YOU MIGHT MEET LADIES ON THEOTHER SIDE. SO THAT'S MY GUY.
HE'S GREAT. AND HE'S ABLE TOAPOLOGIZE WHEN SOMETHING GOES
WRONG. HE'S ABLE TO NOT GET MADEWHEN THE PRESS GETS MAD AT HIM.
SOMEBODY WROTE A BAD REVIEW OFHIS "ROUGH RIDERS" BOOK AND SAID
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS THE ONLYPERSON IN CUBA AND SHOULD HAVE
BEEN CALLED "ALONE IN CUBA"HE WROTE THE GUY BACK AND SAID,
"I REGRET TO TELL YOU, MY WIFEAND FAMILY LOVED YOUR REVIEW OF
MY BOOK."
HE SAID NOW YOU OWE ME ONE.
YOU NEED TO MEET ME BECAUSE IRESPECT THE PRESS.
>> Jon:  AND NOT ATHIN-SKINNED MAN.
HE HAD HIDE ON HIM.
>> HE BUILT HIS OWN HIDE.
HE HAD ASTHMA AND WAS TOLD YOUHAD TO MAKE YOUR BODY AND BECAME
AN EXERCISE MANIC.
>> Jon:  THIS IDEA OFLONG-FORM ACTIVIST MUCKRAKING,
WHEN YOU READ IT, IT BRINGS ATEAR TO YOUR EYE.
IT MAKES YOU DESPAIR WHAT HASBECOME OF OUR CURRENT-- THIS IS
MAYBE EVEN BEFORE UPTONSINCLAIR.
>> THEY'RE ALL FLOATING AROUNDAT THE SAME TIME.
THEY'RE ALL AT ONE MAGAZINECALLED MCLURE'S AND THEY'RE
THE LEGENDS OF JOURNALISM, THEYARE GIVEN TWO YEARS TO DO THEIR
RESEARCH, SO THAT THEY CAN COMEOUT WITH STORIES THAT ARE
FACTUALLY BASED, THAT ARE LIKEMINI HISTORIES.
SO IDA TARBELL WROTE SOMETHINGON STANDARD OIL, AND IT LEADS TO
THE DISINTEGRATION OF STANDARDOIL.
>> Jon:  THEY BREAK UP THEMONOPOLY.
THEY BREAK UP THE MEAT BUSINESS.
>> ISN'T THAT GREAT?
WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO LIVE INTHAT TIME?
>> Jon:  AND THE PEOPLE OFTHE COUNTRY ARE FOLLOWING THESE
STORIES WITH GREAT INTEREST ANDIT HAS A GREAT EFFICACY TO IT.
>> PEOPLE WOULD READ THESE ANDPRESS THEIR CONGRESSMAN.
THEY FELT IF YOU REGULATETHE ECONOMY THE ECONOMY WILL
FALL APART AND THIS WAS THEBEGINNING OF GOVERNMENT HAVING A
REAL ROLE.
IT JUST MAKES ME SAD TO SEEWHERE WE ARE TODAY.
OUR ATTENTION SPAN IS LIMITED--IS THAT YOUR ATTENTION SPAN?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  I WAS JUSTTHINKING, OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I
LOVE?
LOVE?
( LAUGHTER )YOU'RE DEAD ON RIGHT.
AND THE IDEA THAT THESEINSTITUTIONS HOW THESE
INSTITUTIONS HOWEVER CORRUPTTHEY'VE BECOME-- HAVE BECOME THE
ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY'REMADE UP OF PEOPLE IS THE GREAT
TRAGEDY OF THIS MORE MODERN ERA.
>> GUY McCLURE SAID IN THE ENDTHERE'S NO ONE LEFT BUT ALL OF
US, WHICH IS THE PEOPLE.
AND RIGHT NOW WE THE PEOPLE HAVETO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CRAZY
AWFUL -->> YOU NEED TO WRITE THAT ONE.
>> I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.
>> Jon:  SERIOUSLY.
>> IT'S A DEAL.
>> Jon:  I WOULD LOVE TO DOTHAT.
OH, MAN!
"THE BULLY PULPIT" IS ON THESHELVES NOW.
I AM TOTALLY GOING TO RUIN DORISKEARNS GOODWIN'S NEXT BOOK!
