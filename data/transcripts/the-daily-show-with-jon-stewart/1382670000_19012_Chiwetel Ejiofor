>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MYGUEST TONIGHT THE STAR OF
THE NEW FILM 12 YEARS ASLAVE.
>> WE TRAVELING.
>> SURVIVAL IS NOT ABOUT CERTAINDEATH. IT'S ABOUT
KEEPING YOUR HEAD DOWN.
>> DAYS AGO I WASWITH MY FAMILY. NOW YOU TELL
ME ALL THAT'S LOST?
THAT'S THE WAY TOSURVIVE.
I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE.
I WANT TO LIVE.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOMECHIWETEL EIJOFOR.
(APPLAUSE)COME ON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FORHAVING ME.
>> Jon: WAIT A SECOND.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSEPERFORMANCES IN AN ACTOR'S
CAREER THAT IS-- CAN BE LIFECHANGING.
IT'S SO POWERFUL AND SOMAGNETIC.
AND I KNOW YOU ARE A HUMBLEMAN AND PROBABLY TOUGH TO
TAKE SOME OF THATCOMPLIMENT.
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU AREPRODUCING THIS PERFORMANCE,
DOES IT FEEL SPECIAL AT THETIME?
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THATSOMETHING KIND OF WONDEROUS
IS HAPPENING?
>> WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW INTHIS PROJECT YOU ARE
JUST-- I WAS TRYING TO GETAS CLOSE TO SOLOMON AS I COULD.
I THINK I READ THE SCRIPT.
I KNEW WORKING WITH STEVEMcQUEEN WOULD BE QUITE AN
EXPERIENCE. I LOVED HIS WORK.
WHAT A TREMENDOUSFILMMAKER.
>> I THINK HE IS EXCEPTIONALAND HE WAS IN THIS.
AND YOU SORT OF IN THEEND ARE TRYING TO TELL THE
STORY, THE STORY OF SOLOMONNORTHROP
WAS SO AMAZING TO ME.
AND I'D NEVER HEARD A STORYLIKE IT I HAD NEVER SEEN A
FILM LIKE IT.
I HAD NEVER BEEN-- YOU KNOW,SOMETHING THAT IS SO INSIDE
THIS EXPERIENCE, INSIDE THESLAVE EXPERIENCE IN THIS WAY.
SO MOVING TO ME.
SO DAY-TO-DAY I GUESS IF YOUARE HOPING ANYTHING, YOU ARE
HOPING IN THE END IT'S GOINGTO WORK OUT.
BUT YOU ARE, I SUPPOSEYOU'RE JUST TRYING TO BE
WITHIN IT.
AND BE-- PRESENT.
>> AND I IMAGINE STEVE THEDIRECTOR HAS TO PUSH YOU TO
GO TO CERTAIN PLACES IN YOURMIND AND IN YOUR HEART THAT
ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROBABLYPLACE YOURSELF INTO.
BUT THE RANGE OF EMOTION,THE TRIALS AND TRIBLATIONS
THAT THIS SOLOMON, WHO IS AREAL INDIVIDUAL,
THIS IS BASED ON HIS REALDIARY OF THIS EXPERIENCE.
>> YEAH.
>> TO GO TO THOSE PLACES.
IT MUST CHANGE YOU IN SOMEWAY.
>> WELL, STEVE SORT OFALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN, YOU
KNOW.
HE KIND OF JUST CREATES ASET WHERE EVERY PERSON, THE
CAST, THE CREW, THEY ALLFEEL, THERE IS A LOT OF LOVE
ON THAT SET.
IT'S LIKE A FAMILY.
AND WE WERE ALL THERE TO TRYAND TELL THE STORY AS BEST
WE COULD.
AND HE CREATES ANENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE
WANT TO PUSH.
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WANTS TOGIVE 100 PERCENT TO ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY WE DOIT.
BUT IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SOMEBODY
THAT KIND OF ENCOURAGES THATAS WELL, WHO ARTICULATES
THAT IN A WAY AND STEVEDOES.
AND THAT'S WHY I THINKEVERYBODY IN THIS CAST WAS,
AND EVERYBODY ON THE CREWWAS JUST SO DETERMINED TO
TELL THE STORY IN THE BESTWAY WE COULD.
>> Jon: INTERESTING TOO, YOUKNOW.
HE'S OBVIOUSLY A DIRECTORFROM ENGLAND.
ARE YOU AN ACTOR FROMENGLAND.
IT ALMOST-- I WONDER IF, YOUKNOW, PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT
IS THE MOST AUTHENTICPORTRAYAL OF AMERICAN
SLAVERY THAT'S BEEN FILMED.
AND YET MAYBE IT TOOK ACOUPLE OF PEOPLE FROM
ENGLAND TO BE ABLE TO DO ITBECAUSE FOR US, WE WOULD BE
LIKE MAYBE WE MIGHT WANT TOCHANGE THIS ONE LITTLE THING
RIGHT HERE.
WE LOOK KIND OF LIKE ASSESRIGHT HERE.
WAS THERE A NONOWNERSHIP OFIT IN TERMS OF IT BEING THE
HISTORY OF YOUR COUNTRY THATHELPED ALLOW YOU TO GO TO
THE PLACES YOU HAD TO GO TO?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK IN THE END WE WERETALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
WAS, MY FIRST INTERACTIONWITH SLAVERY WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP THE WHOLEUNDERSTANDING OF IT WAS
ALWAYS INTERNATIONAL.
YOU KNOW, BY DEFINITION ITWAS INTERNATIONAL.
AND BOTH PEOPLE FROM AFRICA,INVOLVED AN INTERNATIONAL
KIND OF CONCEPT.
SO I ALWAYS CAME AT IT FROMTHAT ANGLE.
MY FAMILY'S FROM NIGERIA ANDI, AND THAT IS WHERE, YOU
KNOW, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDSOF PEOPLE WERE TAKEN
FROM AND SO I ALWAYS HADTHAT IN MY MIND, AND GROWING
UP IN BRITAIN IN THE WESTINDIE SLAVE TRADE AND HOW
DEVASTATING THAT WAS.
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUTIT I THINK THAT WE ALL FELT
WAS ABOUT A STORY THATWAS-- THAT INVOLVED
EVERYBODY.
THAT WAS WIDER THAN ANY KINDOF NATIONALITY IN A SENSE.
YOU KNOW THAT WE WERETALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
WAS ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY.
AND HUMAN RESPECT.
AND WHAT THOSE THINGS IN THEEND REALLY MEAN AND HOW WE
ENGAGE WITH THAT.
AND OF COURSE AMERICAN, ANDTHIS IS A VERY SPECIFICALLY
AMERICAN STORY, IN THE FACTTHAT IT TAKES PLACE IN
LOUISIANA.
BUT IT ALSO HAD THIS KIND OF,YOU KNOW, THIS SORT OF WIDER
IMPLICATION AND IT FELTCORRECT TO TELL THE STORY,
IT TOOK A SLIGHTLY, ANELEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL.
>> Jon: INTERNATIONAL.
>> AND WHAT WAS CAPTURED SOBEAUTIFULLY, I THINK BY YOU,
THE CAST, THE FILMMAKER, ISTHIS IDEA OF THE FRAGILITY
OF FREEDOM.
THIS GENTLEMAN SOLOMON, THEWONDERFUL MUSICIAN WITH HIS
WONDERFUL FAMILY AND IN AMINUTE IT'S GONE.
AND HE IS SUDDENLY CAST INTOTHIS STRANGE LIMBO.
AND THE FRAGILITY OF IT ISALMOST PART OF WHAT MAKES IT
AS HEARTBREAKING AS IT IS.
>> I THINK THAT'S TRUE.
I REMEMBER WHEN I READ THEBOOK THE FIRST TIME IT WAS
ALMOST AS IF I HAD JUST HADTHIS, YOU KNOW, I STARTED
READING IT AS KIND OF ANOBJECTIVE PIECE.
BUT THEN I SLIPPED DOWN THERABBIT HOLE AND I WAS SO
IMMERSED IN THE EXPERIENCE.
AND I FELT LIKE THIS ISSOMETHING THAT CAN CONNECT
TO ABSOLUTELY ANYBODY.
ANYBODY RECOGNIZESTHEMSELVES IN SOLOMON, AND
WHAT HIS JOURNEY IS AND THESTRUGGLES THAT WE HAVE.
AND HOW WE DEAL WITH OURLIVES IN SOME WAYS.
AND WHAT WE CARE ABOUT.
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A FILMABOUT LOVE IN THE END.
>> Jon: WELL, I'M TELLINGYOU MAN, THE HUMANITY THAT
YOU BRING TO THE ROLE, ANDTHE JUST NUANCES AND THE
LAYERING THAT YOU BRING TOIT IS JUST SLIGHTLY
MAGNIFICENT.
IT JUST IS I CAN'TCONGRATULATE YOU ENOUGH.
IT REALLY IS A BEAUTIFULLYMOVING FILM AND YOUR WORK IN
IT AS WELLAND THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WE APPRECIATE IT.
12 YEARS A SLAVE.
IN THE THEATRES NOW.
GO SEE IT.
