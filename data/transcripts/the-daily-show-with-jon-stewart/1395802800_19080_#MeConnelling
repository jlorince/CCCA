BEFORE WE WENT ON A LITTLE BREAKTHERE, SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL
OF KENTUCKY WAS KNOWN FOR TWOTHINGS.
BEING THE SENATE MINORITYLEADER AND OF COURSE HIS
INFAMOUS SEX TAPE WITH RAY-J.
HEY, UH IS THERE SOMEONE BEHINDME?
[LAUGHTER]SURE FEELS LIKE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]AH-YEP.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT NOW THERE'S A THIRD THING HEIS
KNOWN FOR. THE SENATOR RELEASED
A VERY UNUSUAL TWO AND A HALFMINUTE CAMPAIGN
AD OF JUST HIMSELF LOOKING WEIRDTHAT WE THOUGHT COULD BE
IMPROVED UPON USING THE RIGHTMUSIC.

ITTY-BITTY WAIST -- ♪>> Jon: WE CALLED IT
McCONNELLING AND WE ASKED YOU TOPLAY ALONG AND MAN, DID YOU PLAY
ALONG.

>> Jon: I ENJOYED THAT ONEQUITE A BIT.
THE MAIN THING TO REMEMBER ISIT'S A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD TIME.
BUT THIS AD UNFORTUNATELY THEMcCONNELLING THING HAS TO COME
TO AN END. IT HAS TO.
MAINLY TO MAKE ROOM FORSOMETHING WE'RE CALLING
#MECONNELLING.
IT'S A GAME WHERE YOU NOW PUTYOURSELF INSIDE THE ADS.
ALL YOU NEED IS A CHAIR, ADESK AND A WHOLE LOT OF CREEPY
SMILES.
