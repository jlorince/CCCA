I KNOW WATCHING FOX NEWS MAKES YOU MISINFORMED.
BUT RUNNING IT DOESN'T.
BUT I COULDN'T REMEMBER SO -- AND THIS IS TRUE, I CALLED HIM NOT ON THE PHONE.
I SAT IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND SAID HIS NAME THREE TIMES.
SO, SORRY.
NO.
HE CALLED ME BACK.
VERY GRACIOUS HE CALLED ME BACK.
ROGER AILES CALLED ME BACK AND REMINDED ME THAT 12 YEARS AGO WE MET IN PHILADELPHIA AT THE
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN A BAR AND THEN IT ALL CAME FLOODED BACK.
