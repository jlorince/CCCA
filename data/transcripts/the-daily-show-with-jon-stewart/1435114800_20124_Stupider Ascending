GREAT, WHY DON'T YOU JUST CANCELOUR TRIP TO DISNEYWORLD.
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT FEELSLIKE.
[LAUGHTER]

THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,MAYBE IN HISTORY, WHO LOOKS
LIKE THE BACK OF A SHAR PEIBROUGHT LACK TO LIFE WITH AN
ENCHANTED WIG.

>> AS OF TODAY I'M FILED.
>> TRUMP 2016.
TODAY FORMALLY FILING HISPAPERWORK TO OFFICIALLY BECOME A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
[CROWD CHEERING]
>> Jon: WE'RE BACK.
WE'RE BACK!
HOLY SMOKES.
THAT WAS CLOSE.
I VERY NEARLY ALMOST CLOSEDTHE SHOW AND WALKED AWAY FOR
GOOD.
LUCKILY I WAS AT REHEARSAL ANDKNEW THAT WE HAD THAT OTHER
TAPE.
SO I BASICALLY JUST WASTED FIVEMINUTES OF YOUR TIME.
YOU THINK I'M HAPPY?
CHUCK, SHOW ME OUR CONTROLROOM.
>> I'M FILED.
>> Jon: ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO.
WE'VE GOT TRUMP.
I REPEAT, WE'VE GOT TRUMP.
[LAUGHTER]
THREE, TWO, ONE, LIFT OFF.
>> WE HAVE INCOMPETENT PEOPLERUNNING US.
WE ARE THE BIG, STUPID FOOLS.
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF LOSERS, WEHAVE A BUNCH OF POLITICAL HACKS.
I'VE GOT A JERK NAMEDKRAUTHAMMER OR GEORGE WILL.
THEY'RE LOSER.
JEB BUSH? I WOULD CALL HIM ASTIFF.
MITT ROMNEY, HE CHOKED.
MARCO RUBIO -- OVERRATED PERSON.
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE IRAQ NOTWANT  YOUTO DO THIS.
SYRIA NOT WANT YOU TO DO THAT.
>> THERE IS NO IRAQ.
>> ALL RIGHT, SO YOU DON'TRESPECT THEM.
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT FORTHEM.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T FIRECOUNTRIES, RIGHT.
OR CAN YOU?
YOU'RE TRUMP.
HEY NEW GUINEA, DONE. ZAIRE,BYE-RE.
URAGUAY, YOU'RE-A  GONE.
MYNMAR, YOU CAN STAY. BUT YOU'REGOING BACK TO BEING CALLED
BURMA.
I BOUGHT ONE MAP, '74, IT'S GOLDPLATED, I CAN'T CHANGE IT.
OBVIOUSLY BEING PRESIDENT ISMORE THAN BEING OUR NATION'S
MOST PROMINENT DIPLOMAT.
HE WILL ALSO BE OUR COMMANDER INTRUMP, AND THAT IS WHERE THINGS
REALLY GET GOOD.
>> ISIS, ON ARE YOU GOING TODEFEAT ISIS.
>> I WOULD HIT THEM SO HARD.
TAKE BACK THE OIL.
ONCE YOU GO OVER AND TAKE BACKTHAT OIL, THEY HAVE NOTHING.
YOU BOMB THE HELL OUT OF THEMAND ENCIRCLE IT, AND THEN YOU GO
IN.
>> ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU'REGOING TO SEND AMERICAN GROUND
TROOPS INTO SYRIA?
>> I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU TOLD HIMEVERYTHING--
YOU JUST TOLD HIM THE WHOLE[BLEEP] PLAN.
I'LL RUN IT BY, YOU DO THE BOMB,THE CIRCLE AND THEN YOU GO IN
AND TAKE THE OIL.
I MEAN BOOM.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL [BLEEP] PLAN.
YOU'RE LIKE SUN [BLEEP] TZU.
UNLESS THAT'S THE PLAN TO THROWEVERYBODY OFF AND THE REAL PLAN
IS TO DIG FROM HERE TO SYRIA, UPSTATE NEW YORK PRISONER STYLE.
SUCK OUT THE IRAQI MILK SHAKEFROM BELOW.
MAYBE I'M JUST MISSING THEBRUTAL ELEGANCE OF TRUMP'S
THREE-STEP PLAN TO DEFINITIVELYEND THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
ONE STE,P BEING DEMEANING THOSEWHO COMMAND BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP
IS A MILITARY GENIUS.
ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES.
>> THERE'S NOBODY BIGGER ORBETTER AT THE MILITARY THAN I
AM.
[LAUGHTER]
[AUDIENCE BOOS]
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT YOU AREBOOING HIS GRAMMAR.
[LAUGHTER]
THE FACT THAT THE NOUN DID NOTFOLLOW THE PROPER --
"I AM THE BIGGEST AND THE BESTOF THE MILITARY HAS EVER BEEN."
"ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS TERRIBLEAT THE MILITARY."
[LAUGHTER]
THAT GUY COULDN'T EVENCONSECRATE THE GROUND AT
GETTYSBURG.
HIS WORDS, NOT MINE."
THAT BLUBUSED-THUMBED, LANKYPRICK.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS, DONALDTRUMP WOULD'VE CONSECRATED
AND HOLLOWED THE [BLEEP] OUTTATHAT GROUND.
HOW AWESOME WAS TRUMP'SPOST-ANNOUNCEMENT
PUBLICITY TOUR?
>> I ACTUALLY LAUGHED WHENYOU SAID YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD
THIS GIANT WALL FROM SAN DIEGOTO BROWNSVILLE AND THE MEXICANS
ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
>> Jon: THE GUY WHOSE IDEA TOSAVE THE MIDDLE EAST WAS TO
RECONSTITUTE THE MERCENARYARMIES OF OLD -- SADDLE UP,
HESSIANS. WE'RE GOING IN.
THAT GUY FINDS YOUR IDEASABSURD.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW DOES THAT TASTE?
>> I'LL START CHARGING FOR THEIRPRODUCT COMING INTO THIS
COUNTRY.
>> SO TRY TO STRANGLE THEMECONOMICALLY UNTIL THEY PAY FOR
THAT WALL?
>> THE WALL WILL  GO UP ANDMEXICO WILL START BEHAVING.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO ECONOMIC SANCTIONS,TARIFFS.
I THINK WE HAVE A TREATY, NAFTA,THAT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO DO
THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
AND OBVIOUSLY STRANGLING MEXICOECONOMICALLY WOULD MORE THAN
LIKELY ACTUALLY CREATE A MASSEXODUS INTO THE UNITED STATES.
NOT TO MENTION A LITTLE BIT OFTHE HARDSHIP IN TERMS OF
WALL-PAYING-FOR.
PERHAPS LOGIC IS NOT THE BESTWAY TO ATTACK YOUR PLAN.
LET'S JUST GO WITH MEXICO'S ACOUNTRY.
SO AS FAR AS BEHAVING, PRETTYSURE YOU CAN'T GROUND A COUNTRY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND TRUMP, BY THE WAY, ISN'TAFRAID TO BORROW FROM THE
GREAT REPUBLIC LEADERS PAST.
>> YOU'RE RUNNING ON REAGAN'S1980 SLOGAN, LET'S MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN.
>> NO, MY SLOGAN'S DIFFERENT.
MY SLOGAN IS MAKE AMERICA GREATAGAIN.
HE SAID -- HE PUT A DIFFERENT --HE DIDNT' USE THE WORD "AGAIN."
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: FORGETTING THE FACTREAGAN DID USE THE WORD
"AGAIN"-- IT'S RIGHT ON THE[BLEEP]ING BUTTON.
SO YOU'RE USING THE WORD "AGAIN"AGAIN, THE ONLY CHAGNE YOU MADE
TO HIS SLOGAN WAS THE "LET'S."
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME SLOGAN ASREAGAN, EXCEPT RUDER.
[LAUGHTER]
REAGAN'S WAS AN INVITATION,YOURS IS A COMMAND, MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN.
DON'T BOTHER ME UNTIL YOU DO,I'LL BE INSIDE [BLEEP] GOLD.
THIS GUY IS AMAZING.
HERE'S THE BEST PART.
HE'S GOT NO CHANCE.
IN FACT, HE'S GREAT FOR THEREPUBLICANS BECAUSE THE MORE HE
TALKS, THE MORE HE APPEARS ONTELEVISION AND THE MORE HE
MAKES REPUBLICS CRAZY SEEM KINDOF REASONABLE BY COMPARISON.
I MEAN HONESTLY.
LET TRUMP RUN, LET'S HAVE FUN.
WHAT'S THE HARM OF RIDING THISCRAZY TRAIN AS LONG AS IT'LL
TAKE US.
>> THE SHAKEUP IN THE REPUBLICRACE FOR PRESIDENT.
NEW NUMBERS JUST IN SHOWBUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP MAKING
HUGE GAINS.
HE'S IN SECOND PLACE IN NEWHAMPSHIRE.
>> Jon: WELL.
SORRY MEXICO, I GUESS IT'SLIGHTS OUT AT 8:00 P.M. NOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
