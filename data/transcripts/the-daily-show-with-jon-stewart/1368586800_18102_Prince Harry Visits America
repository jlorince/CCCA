AND HAVING MEETINGS NOW.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT I TELL YOU WHO THE REAL
VICTIM OF THIS IS.
DAVID CAMERON.
CAMERON JUST HAD TO SORT OF
STAND THERE LOOKING DOWN FOR
THE GRILLING.
HE'S LIKE A KID WHO GOT
INVITED OVER TO A FRIEND'S
HOUSE FOR DINNER ON THE
NIGHT HIS FRIEND'S PARENTS
FILED FOR DIVORCE.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT, I
THINK I'LL TAKE MY PLATE AND
EAT OUTSIDE IF THAT'S ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
FOR MORE ON PRIME MINISTER
CAMERON'S WHITE HOUSE VISIT
WE GO TO JOHN OLIVER AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
JOHN!
HOW ARE YOU SIR?
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THIS
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE.
>> JON, I THINK IT'S PRETTY
CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA PICKED THE
WRONG BRIT.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A
DISTRACTION FOR THE PRESS,
YOU HAVE GOT TO GO WITH THIS
GUY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> IS THAT ONE DIRECTION?
>> NO, IT'S NOT ONE
DIRECTION, JON.
PRINCE HARRY IS IN TOWN, JON,
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE BRIT
THAT YOU WANT.
NOT THE PASTEY MP FROM WEST
OXFORDSHARE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
DASHING SOLDIER PRINCE WHO
MAKES PEOPLE REACT TO HIM
LIKE THIS.
>> FRANKLY, I FOUND HIM TO
BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG
MAN.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU JUST HEARD HIM RIGHT
THERE, JON, PRINCE HARRY
JUST GAVE THAT MAN HIS FIRST
ERECTION SINCE 1983.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THAT'S A FACT SO WITH
THAT IN MIND, JUST IMAGINE
WHAT YOU COULD DO TO THE
WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS.
I WOULD ASK YOU A LOT MORE
THAN SAY SOMEONE WHO'S IS
DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THESE
OLD WAX STATUES.
JON, THE FACT THAT THE
PRESIDENT WAS SITTING ON
THIS ROYAL ASSET ALL WEEK
AND FAILED TO USE IT MAY BE
THE MOST DAMNING SIGN OF HIS
COMPETENT SO FAR.
>> Jon: I UNDER STARCH.
I ACTUALLY SAW THE PRINCE
LAY A WREATH AT ARTICLETON
CEMETERY AND I WOULD SAY T
WAS VERY MOVING.
>> I SAW IT TOO, I AGREE
WITH YOU.
AND PRINCE HARRY WAS JUST
WARMING UP.
HE THEN WENT ON TO WOUNDED
WARRIORS AND THREW AN
AMERICAN FOOTBALL ADOREABLY
BADLY.
>> Jon: THORT.
>> IN THE WAY TO MANAGE TO
INDICATE BOTH ATHLETICISM
AND ALSO A CHARMING LACK OF
SKILL AT ANY SPORT NOT
PLAYED WHILE MOUNTED ON A
HORSE.
AND THEN, JON, HE GAVE HIS
EYE TO A BABY, JON.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> TO A BABY!
>> Jon: WOW.
>> A BABY WHO HAD ALREADY
HAD TWO EYES!
THAT IS WHO YOU WANT AS YOUR
DISTRACTION WING MAN, JON,
WHEN SOME REPORTER ASKS YOU
A 17 PART QUESTION THAT
ESSENTIALLY BOILS DOWN TO
WHY CAN'T YOU BE A BETTER
PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: I MEAN I DON'T KNOW,
JOHN, I DON'T KNOWN, I DON'T
EVEN THINK MARRY COULD
PROTECT THE PRESIDENT WITH
ALL THIS GOING ON.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PRESS
STARTS ASK ABOUT THE
BENGHAZI ARB REPORT.
>> YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT, JOHN.
>> Jon: I'M SAYING.
>> SORRY, I WAS-- I WAS JUST
THINKING ABOUT THAT
INTERVIEW THE PRINCE HARRY
CUT SHORT IN AFGHANISTAN
WHEN HE SUDDENLY HAD TO GO
FLY AN APACHE HELICOPTER AND
SHOOT BAD GUYS, JON.
>> Jon: CAN WE WATCH IT
AGAIN.
>> IS THERE ANY WAY TO WATCH
IT AGAIN.
>> OF COURSE WE CAN.
ROLL IT AGAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, WE COULD REALLY
USE SOMEONE LIKE HARRY.
WE COULD REALLY USE SOMEONE
LIKE HARRY.
>> WHY DO YOU THINK WE STILL
HAVE THE ROYAL FAMILY, JON.
THEY SERVE ABSOLUTELY NO
PURPOSE WHATSOEVER EXCEPT AS
A PLEASANT DISTRACTION.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND, BRITAIN
IS MISERABLE, JON.
WE'RE IN A DOUBLE DIP
RECESSION WITH A PRIME
MINISTER THAT ABSOLUTELY
NOBODY LIKES.
THE ONLY THING THAT GETS US
THROUGH THE DAY ARE THE
COMING AND GOINGS OF A
GENETICALLY A TEN WAITED ON
SOL ESENCE AND THEIR
COLLECTION OF TREMENDOUSLY
SILLY [BLEEP] HATS!
>> Jon: WORDS TO LIVE BY,
THANK YOU, JOHN, JOHN OLVER,
EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT
