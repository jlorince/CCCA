>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST "NEW YORK TIMES"BEST SELLING AUTHOR, WHOSE
NEW BOOK IS CALLED "HERETIC: WHYISLAM NEEDS REFORMATION NOW."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THEPROGRAM AYAAN HIRSI ALI.
HELLO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HOW ARE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.
SIT.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GOOD. THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOININGUS.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "HERETIC:WHY ISLAM NEEDS A
REFORMATION NOW."
MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE WHYDOES ISLAM NEED A
REFORMATION NOW?
>> BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY TOOMANY PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE
NAME OF ISLAM, TOO MANYWOMEN LIVE UNDER OPPRESSION.
TOO MANY JEWS ARE BEINGDEMONIZED FOR IT,
TOO MANY GAYS ARE BEING KILLEDIN THE NAME OF ISLAM.
TOO MANY CHRISTIANS ARE BEINGKILLED IN THE NAME OF ISLAM.
I THINK IT REALLY HAS THEANSWERS TO HAVE
THE REFORMATION NOW.
>> BUT ISN'T IT, IF I'MREMEMBERING THE REFORMATION
CORRECTLY, AND IT'S BEEN AWHILE --
>> YEAH.
>> WASN'T THE -- AREN'T WEHAVING THAT NOW?
AREN'T WE HAVING THEREFORMATION NOW?
THE REFORMATION WAS MARTINLUTHER WANTED A PURER FORM
OF CHRISTIANITY.
AND SO WHEN HE PUT THAT UPTHERE, IT CREATED A HUNDRED
YEARS OF VIOLENCE AND MAYHEM.
ISN'T THAT THE PROCESS THATWE ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT
NOW?
>> IT IS THE PROCESS THATWE'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT
NOW.
IT'S THE PROCESS THAT IDESCRIBE IN THE BOOK, THAT
YOU KNOW, TALK OF REFORMATIONIN ISLAM HAS BEEN UNDER
WAY FOR A WHILE.
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUTNOW IS YES, THERE IS A GREAT
DEAL OF VIOLENCE IN THE NAMEOF ISLAM BUT THERE IS AN
EMERGING AND INCREDIBLYIMPORTANT MINORITY OF REFORMERS
WHO ARE RISKING THEIR LIVESTRYING TO GET THIS CHANGE DONE.
AND I STAND WITH THEM. I HOPEYOU STAND WITH THEM.
>> RIGHT. WELL, NO, I MEAN,I GUESS MY POINT IS, I THINK
PEOPLE SINGLE OUT ISLAM ASTHOUGH THERE'S SOMETHING
INHERENTLY WRONG WITHIT THAT WASN'T WRONG
WITH OTHER RELIGIONS.
AND SO I GUESS MY POINT ISIF CHRISTIANITY WENT THROUGH
ALMOST THE EXACT SAMEPROCESS, PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT
THEY KNEW BETTER AND WEREPURER AND THAT CREATED
VIOLENCE, AND SO WHY, I GETTHE SENSE THAT YOU THINK
ISLAM IS DIFFERENT THANOTHER RELIGIONS.
>> WELL, I'M SAYING THATCHRISTIANITY WENT THROUGH
THAT PROCESS OF REFORMATIONAND ENLIGHTENMENT AND CAME TO A
FACE WHERE THE MASS OFCHRISTIANS AT LEAST IN THE
WESTERN WORLD --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> HAVE ACCEPTED TOLERANCE INTHE SECULAR STATE, THE
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE,RESPECT FOR WOMEN,
RESPECT FOR GAYS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WELL.
>> YEAH WELL -->> Jon: AND IN AFRICA I THINK
THERE ARE STILL CENTRALAFRICAN REPUBLIC STILL HAS
CHRISTIAN -->> CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN THE
NAME OF CATHOLICISM AND AREHOMOPHOBIC.
>> Jon: YES. AND ALSO BEHEADMUSLIMS AND DO CRAZY THINGS.
>> YEAH. CENTRAL AFRICANREPUBLIC.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT THE MAJORITY OFCHRISTIANS --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OFMUSLIMS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO
VIOLENCE.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW70% OF THE GLOBAL VIOLENCE IN
THE WORLD TODAY-->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> MUSLIMS ARE RESPONSIBLE.
AND THE LARGEST NUMBER VICTIMSFROM IT.
>> Jon: OR ARE SUFFERING FROMIT.
BUT I GUESS MY POINT IS ITSEEMS LIKE THE NARRATIVE IS
FROM SOME REFORMISTS THATTHERE IS SOMETHING
INHERENTLY WRONG WITH THISRELIGION THAT IS NOT WRONG
WITH OTHER RELIGIONS.
AND THAT'S THE THING THATI'M TRYING TO GET AT.
>> YEAH, SO HERE'S THE KEYPOINT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> THERE WERE CHRISTIANS WITHINCHRISTIANITY WHO CAME OUT
AND SAID, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TOCHANGE THINGS.
WE NEED TO REFORM,BASICALLY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE ARE NOW MUSLIMSTODAY IN GROWING NUMBERS,
NOT AS LARGE AS I WOULD LIKE TOSEE --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT IN GROWING NUMBERS WE'RENOT POINTING THE FINGER TOWARDS
THE JEWS OR CHRISTIANS ORAMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY OR
SOME OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORBUT THEY'RE SAYING THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITHIN OURRELIGION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND WHAT I'M TRING TO DO HEREAS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP WITH THIS
RELIGION AND CAME OUT OF ITAND VERY MUCH, YOU KNOW,
DRIVEN BY A DESIRE TO CHANGE IT.OR TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> OR TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE INTHE CONVERSATION IS TO, OKAY,
LET'S IDENTIFY IT.
AND WHAT IS WRONG ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IT WITH ISLAMTHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE AND THEN
I HAVE FIVE KEY POINTS.
>> Jon: BUT I GUESS WHAT I AMSAYING IS THE REFORMATION
WAS NOT PEOPLE WHOWANTED TO MODERATE
CHRISTIANITY, IT WAS PEOPLETHAT WANTED IT PURER WHO
FELT THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCHHAD BECOME CORRUPT.
>> THE TWO, YEAH, SO THE TWORELIGIONS, CHRISTIANITY IS
DIFFERENT FROM ISLAM.
THE ONES IN ISLAM WHAT ARE YOUKNOW ISLAMIC STATES RIGHT NOW IN
IRAQ AND SYRIA, GROUPS LIKETHAT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. THEY WANT A MOREPURE FORM.
>> THEY WANT --
>> Jon: AS THEY INTERPRET IT.
>> WELL, AND AS THEY APPLY IT.
>> Jon: AS THEY APPLY IT.
>> AND AS THE QUR'AN SAYS ANDTHE PROPHET MOHAMED LIVED IN
MEDINA.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO EMULATEHIM IN THAT TIME.
>> I HAPPEN TO THINK THATTHE QUR'AN IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN
BY A MAN AND BY MEN, AND ITIS TIME FOR THAT NARRATIVE TO
CHANGE. SO, I TOTALLY AGREE --
>> Jon: YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING,LIKE TO SAY THAT IF WE JUST
CHANGE THE TEXT, DON'T WEHAVE TO SOMEWHAT CHANGE --
>> NO, WHAT I'M ARGUINGIS NOT TO CHANGE THE TEXT.
>> Jon: YEAH. I SEE.
>> WHAT I'M ARGUING FOR IS FOR
MUSLIMS TO ACCEPT THE FACTTHAT THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN BY
A MAN A LONG TIME AGO ANDTHAT MORALITY-- OF THE 7th --
>> Jon: BUT THAT HASN'T BEENACCEPTED IN CHRISTIANITY YET.
>> MORALITY IN THE 7TH CENTURYDOESN'T APPLY TO THE 21st
CENTURY. AND THEY HAVE TOGIVE THAT UP.
>> Jon: THAT'S DIFFERENT.
>> I HONESTLY THINK THATMOST CHRISTIANS
HAVE ACCEPTEDTHAT.
>> Jon: THAT THE BIBLE WASWRITTEN BY MAN.
>> THAT THE MORALITY OF GODKNOWS WHEN DOESN'T APPLY NOW.
>> Jon: THAT'S DIFFERENT.
>> AND MOST MUSLIMS ARESTRUGGLING, ON THE ONE HAND
THE GROUP I CALL THE MECCAMUSLIMS, ON THE ONE HAND,
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO BE ASTRUE TO THEIR RELIGION AS
THEY POSSIBLY CAN WHILE
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARESTRUGGLING TO THEN, YOU KNOW,
BE MODERN AND LIVE PEACEFULPROSPEROUS LIVES.
AND I THINK THE WAY OUT OFTHAT IS TO START THE
CONVERSATION ON THEPROBLEMS-- .
>> Jon: YOU WOULD LIKEPEOPLE TO BUY YOUR BOOK.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGETHE CONVERSATION. YEAH, BUY MY
BOOK, PLEASE HEAR IT FORYOURSELF.
>> Jon: OKAY. "HERETIC" IT ISON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
AYAAN HIRSI ALI.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
