>> Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUESTTONIGHT, HE IS THE HOST AND
MANAGING EDITOR OF "TRAVISSMILEY" ON PBS.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "DEATHOF A KING: THE REAL STORY
OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KINGJR.'S FINAL YEAR."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,TAVIS SMILEY! SIR!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HOW ARE YOU?
>> I AM WELL, SIR.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> Jon: I AM DOING SO WELL. ANDTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: "DEATH OF A KING."
YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS BOOK.
NOW, IT'S COMING OUT NOW INSEPTEMBER.
NOW I WOULD THINK GENERALLY THEYWOULD SAY, LET'S GET THIS OUT
FOR MARTIN LUTHER KING'SBIRTHDAY, LET'S GET THIS OUT
MAYBE ON THE ANNIVERSARYOF HIS DEATH.
WHY SEPTEMBER?
>> I THINK, WHAT I SAID IN THEINTRODUCTION IS, I SAY HIS
MARTYRDOM HAS SOMEHOW MUFFLEDHIS MESSAGE.
SO IF YOU PUT THE BOOK OUT INJANUARY, IT GETS CONNECTED AND
CAUGHT UP WITH THE HOLIDAY.
YOU PUT IT OUT IN FEBRUARY HEGETS BLACKENIZED.
IF YOU PUT HIM IN FEBRUARY,AND HE'S MORE THAN JUST A
BLACK FIGURE IN THIS COUNTRY.
HE'S AN AMERICAN ICON AS FAR ASI'M CONCERNED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND MAYBE EVEN AMERICA'SGREATEST DEMOCRATIC, SMALL D,
PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET HIMBLACKENNIZED IN FEBRUARY.
PUT HIM IN APRIL, PUT THE BOOKOUT IN APRIL WHEN HE'S
ASSASSINATED THEN YOU GETCAUGHT UP AGAIN IN THE
MARTYRDOM...>> Jon: MARTYRDOM, RIGHT.
>> YOU PUT IT OUT IN SEPTEMBER,HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LASTYEAR OF HIS LIFE AND THE
SACRIFICE THAT HE MADE.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE LOOKING TOTAKE AN AMERICAN ICON AND
HUMANIZE HIM SO THAT THISCOUNTRY CAN HAVE A SERIOUS AND
REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ISSUESOF RACE AND MARTIN LUTHER KING.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU WENTWRONG.
THAT'S WHERE YOU WENTWRONG. NOW I SEE THE PROBLEM.
(LAUGHTER)>> IMAGINE THAT...
>> Jon: IMAGINE THAT.>> A SERIOUS CONVERSATION.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: IT IS, I THINK IT'S
FASCINATING TO ME, YOU KNOW, ASSOMEONE WHO ALWAYS ADMIRED
DR. KING, WHO ALWAYS THOUGHTHE FOUGHT IT, THAT LAST YEAR OF
HIS LIFE, HE REALLY FELL UPONDIFFICULT TIMES FOR HIMSELF.
>> MM-HMM.
>> Jon: HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOSTTHAT DRIVE, IN A WAY.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK HE LOSTTHE DRIVE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I THINK THE COUNTRY DIDN'TWANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH HE WAS
TELLING BECAUSE THAT TRUTH, JON,MAY HAVE JUST BEEN TOO
SUBVERSIVE FOR THE NATION TOHANDLE. I THINK IT'S TRUE
WHETHER YOU'RE JON STEWART,TAVIS SMILEY OR ANYBODY IN THE
AUDIENCE OR WATCHING TONIGHT,WE COME TO KNOW WHO WE REALLY
ARE IN THE DARKEST AND MOSTDIFFICULT DAYS OF OUR LIVES.
SO IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW DR.KING AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE
JOURNEY OF THE LAST YEAR, HISSORT OF LAST MILE OF THE WAY,
THEN YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW HIMBECAUSE WHEN KING COMES OUT
AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM ANDCALLS AMERICA THE GREATEST
PURVEYOR OF VIOLENCE IN THEWORLD TODAY. THIS IS A BLACK
MAN, EVEN WITH A NOBEL PEACEPRIZE, IN '67 TELLING AMERICA
YOU ARE THE GREATEST PURVEYOR OFVIOLENCE IN THE WORLD.
AND THEN HE TALKED ABOUT THATTRIPLE THREAT AS HE CALLED IT
OF RACISM, POVERTY ANDMILITARISM.
AND THEN HE STARTS ORGANIZINGA POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN.
AND SO BASICALLY WHATHAPPENS IS THEY SAY TO HIM,
NEGRO, WE TOLD YOU YOU COULDTALK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS
BUT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT FOREIGNPOLICY. YOU DON'T TELL AMERICA
HOW TO SPEND ITS FEDERAL BUDGETDOLLARS.
BECAUSE KING WAS SAYING THATWAR IS THE ENEMY OF THE POOR.
THOSE BOMBS THAT YOU'RE DROPPINGOVER THERE ARE LANDING IN THE
GHETTOS AND BARIOS OF AMERICA,
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE TELLSTHAT TRUTH?
THE WHITE HOUSE, JOHNSON TURNSON HIM THEY'D WORKED TOGETHER
ON VOTING AND CIVIL RIGHTS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT NOW HE'S AGAINST THEVIETNAM WAR, AND JOHNSON DOESN'T
LIKE THAT. SO THE JOHNSON WHITEHOUSE TURNS ON HIM, THE MEDIA
TURNS ON HIM. WHEN YOU READYEARS LATER, YOU READ NOW IN
THIS BOOK WHAT THE "NEW YORKTIMES," THE LIBERAL "NEW YORK
TIMES," THE LIBERAL "WASHINGTONPOST," "TIME MAGAZINE"
SAID ABOUT HIM IT'SEMBARRASSING.
AND THE BLACK MEDIA TURNED ONHIM.
SO, THE WHITE HOUSE TURNSON HIM, THE MEDIA TURNS ON HIM,
AND THEN WHITE AMERICA TURNS ONHIM.
SO THE LAST POLL TAKEN IN HISLIFE FINDS...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE HARRIS POLL, 75% OFAMERICANS THOUGHT HE WAS
IRRELEVANT IN THE LAST YEAR OFHIS LIFE.
BUT HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT.
ALMOST 60% OF BLACK FOLK THOUGHTDR. KING WAS PERSONA NON GRATA.
HE COULDN'T GET HIS OWNORGANIZATION SUPPORTING
ON THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN.
SO THIS IS A STORY OF MARTINLUTHER KING WE DON'T KNOW. WHY?
BECAUSE WE DEIFIED HIM IN DEATH,BUT WE DEMONIZED HIM IN LIFE.
AND THIS STORY ABOUT KING, WEAIN'T COMES TO TERMS WITH YET.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WOW. I'M SORRY. I'M
JUST GONNA, IF I MAY... SORRY,I'M JUST GONNA  END THE
INTERVIEW NOW AND GO READ THIS.
(APPLAUSE)THERE IS NO END TO THIS TYPE OF
TRUTH BEING TOLD TO AMERICA THATWE DON'T WANT TO HEAR AND, SO,
THE CYCLE CONTINUES.>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT AT SOME LEVEL, TOASK US TO FACE THE REALITY OF
OUR PAST AND OUR HISTORY, WHILESTILL MAINTAINING ALL THAT YOU
BELIEVE IS GOOD AND ENDURINGABOUT THIS COUNTRY,
YOU WILL BE VILIFIED.
>> INDEED.
>> Jon: AND THE SAME GOES FORTODAY AND ALL THAT HE HAD DONE
WAS WASHED AWAY IN THOSESTATEMENTS.
>> WE SANG A SONG IN MY CHURCH,AND I DON'T MEAN TO PROSELYTIZE,
BUT KING BEFORE HE WAS ANYTHINGWAS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL.
HE WAS THE REVEREND DR. KING.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THERE'S A SONG WE SANG INMY CHURCH GROWING UP IN A LITTLE
SMALL TOWN IN INDIANA.
"MUST JESUS BEAR THE CROSS ALONEAND ALL THE WORLD GO FREE?
NO, THERE'S A CROSS FOR EVERYONEAND THERE'S A CROSS FOR ME."
EVEN IF YOU'RE ATHEIST ORAGNOSTIC YOU UNDERSTAND THE
POINT. WE ALL HAVE OURCROSS TO BEAR IN LIFE...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND THE POINT IS THE MORE
TRUTH YOU TELL THE CLOSER YOUARE TO GETTING UP ON THE CROSS
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DEALWITH PEOPLE WHO TELL US THE
TRUTH. SO THIS BOOK, I THINK,AND I HOPE AT LEAST IS A
CAUTIONARY TALE TO YOURBRINGING UP A POINT, JON.
A CAUTIONARY TALE FORAMERICA RIGHT NOW.
THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, ISEE THEM ON YOUR SHOW EVERY
NIGHT, WHO ARE DOING THEIR BESTTO TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT
AMERICA TODAY, AND WHAT WE'REDOING TO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND
WE'RE TURNING A DEAF EAR.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE ISSUE OF POVERTY, WEDON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THE DRONE
PROGRAM ON STEROIDS, WEDON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOAGAINST ALL THE ODDS ARE TRYING
TO GET US TO DEAL WITHINCONVENIENT, UNSETTLING,
UNHOUSING TRUTHS EVEN RIGHT NOWTHAT WE DON'T WANT THE HEAR.
BUT KING'S LIFE POINTS OUT THERE
IS A PRICE TO PAY FOR IGNORINGSOCIETY'S TRUTH TELLERS.
>> Jon: WHY IS NOSTALGIA SUCHA POWERFUL ERASER OF THESE
REALITIES?>> BECAUSE IT'S SO...
>> Jon: WHY IS IT SO EASY TOERASE THE REAL HISTORY OF THIS?
>> GREAT QUESTION.
BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO CELEBRATEDEAD MARTYRS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
HERE TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE.
THEY'RE NOT HERE TO PUT THETRUTH IN YOUR FACE.
>> Jon: WOULD HE HOLD USACCOUNTABLE FOR THE WAY THAT
WE'VE DEIFIED HIM?
>> ABSOLUTELY, HE WOULD. IF HEWERE HERE RIGHT NOW,
HE WOULD CERTAINLY CELEBRATEBARACK OBAMA, THE FIRST
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT, BUTON THIS DAY, SEPTEMBER 11, WHEN
THE HEADLINE IN EVERY PAPER INTHIS COUNTRY IS WE'RE GOING TO
START THIS ALL OVER AGAIN -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> START BOMBING AGAIN...>> Jon: RIGHT.
MY FRIEND, WILL YOU PLEASE STICKAROUND?
>> HAPPY TO DO IT.
>> Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BITMORE.
THERE ARE THINGS GOING ON NOW INTHE COUNTRY THAT I'D ALSO LIKE
TO GET TO BEYOND THAT.>> HAPPY TO DO IT.
>> Jon: "DEATH OF A KING"IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
CHEF RECOMMEND.
TAVIS SMILEY, EVERYBODY.
