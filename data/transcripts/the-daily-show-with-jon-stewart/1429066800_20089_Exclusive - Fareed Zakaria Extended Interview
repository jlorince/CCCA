(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE HOST OFCNN'S "FAREED ZAKARIA GPS,"
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "INDEFENSE OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION"!
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, FAREED ZAKARIA. SIR!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)I AM DELIGHTED!
HERE'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THISBOOK, "IN DEFENSE OF A LIBERAL
EDUCATION."
AND WHAT HE HAS DONE HERE WHICHI THINK IS SPECTACULAR OF YOU
TO DO AND IT'S A GREATVALUE, IF YOU BUY IT,
YOU CAN CUT THIS OUT -- (LAUGHTER)
-- AND THIS SIGNIFIES THAT YOUHAVE GRADUATED WITH A
BACHELOR OF ARTS FROM -- ANDTHEN FILL IN WHATEVER
UNIVERSITY.
>> AND ON THIS SHOW, LET'SNOW SAY IT'S SUMMA CUM LAUDE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: IT'S -- REALLY?
>> HIGHEST HONORS.
>> Jon: YOU GOTTA, YOU GOTTAMAKE THAT A LIMITED EDITION
OFFER.
NOW, WE -- LIBERAL EDUCATION,WHY DO YOU THINK YOU NEED TO
DEFEND IT?
COLLEGE SEEMS TO BE VERYPOPULAR.
PEOPLE ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS ANDTHOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO DO THIS.
WHY DEFEND THIS THING THAT SEEMSTO BE HAVING A VERY GOOD DECADE?
>> BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT'SHAPPENED IS EVERYONE IS
CONVINCED WE ALL NEED TOBECOME ENGINEERS OR AT
LEAST LEARN THE CODE.
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT IS GOINGAROUND SAYING TO PEOPLE DON'T
MAJOR IN ART HISTORY.
REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS INTHREE OR FOUR STATES ARE
ACTUALLY CUTTING FUNDING,TRYING TO ELIMINATE MAJORS LIKE
ART HISTORY AND ANTHROPOLOGY.
YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNOR OFFLORIDA I THINK HE SAID WE DON'T
NEED ANY MORE ANTHROPOLOGISTSIN FLORIDA.
TO WHICH I THINK ACTUALLYANTHROPOLOGISTS COULD DO
A LOT TO TRY TO KIND OF STUDYFLORIDA, AND TELL YOU,
AND TELL YOU, BUT -- (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THE PEOPLE ENJOY THAT.
>> BUT THE MAIN POINT IS I THINKPEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND LOOK
IF YOU LIKE SCIENCE, YOU LIKEENGINEERING, THAT'S FANTASTIC,
DO IT, BUT, THERE ARE, YOUKNOW,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKINGFOR 50, 60 YEARS, YOU WANT TO
MAKE THIS COLLEGE EXPERIENCEBROAD, GENERAL WITH SKILLS THAT
WILL HELP YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> DON'T SIT THERE, YOU KNOWOBSESSING THAT YOU NEED TO --
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE THINKING WENEED, BUT ISN'T THAT THE TYPE
OF -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUTLEARNING HOW TO THINK.
>> EXACTLY.
>> Jon: YOU THINK WE SHOULDLEARN HOW TO THINK.
NOT JUST -- ISN'T THAT SOMETHINGTHEY SHOULD KNOW BY COLLEGE?
ISN'T, BY THE TIME YOU'RE 18,SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE SOME SENSE
OR HAVEN'T WE FAILEDAT THAT POINT?
>> I DON'T THINK I KNEW HOW TOTHINK BY THE TIME I GOT TO
COLLEGE, DID YOU?
>> Jon: I WAS TOO HIGH.
(LAUGHTER)NO, BUT IT'S, I GUESS MY POINT
IS THAT ISN'T THERE ROOM, DON'TWE NEED TO REVAMP
OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM?
ISN'T IT ANTIQUATED, THE IDEAOF, YOU KNOW, 12 YEARS OF
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLESCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND
ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OFCOLLEGE, ISN'T SO MUCH OF THAT
ANTIQUATED AND WE NEED TORE-THINK THE ENTIRE SYSTEM?
>> AND JUST LIKE GO OUT AND LIVEWITH THE WORLD, IS THAT WHAT --
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT!
HOW ABOUT THIS, COLLEGE, MAKE ITTHREE INSTEAD OF FOUR.
DO YOU REALLY NEED FOUR YEARS OFCOLLEGE?
MAKE IT THREE, MAKE ONE YEAR OFPUBLIC SERVICE, BOOM,
DONE.
WE JUST REVAMPED IT.
>> I NEVER KNEW YOU'RE SUCH AREVOLUTIONARY.
>> Jon: I'M A REVOLUTIONARY,BABY, AND HIGH SCHOOL IS
BULL (BLEEP), TOO!
>> BUT HERE'S THE -- BUT HERE'S,HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT
ALL OF THAT. I'M NOT GETTINGINTO K-12 --
>> Jon: LET ME STOP YOU REALQUICK ON THE THING.
>> YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: KIDS, KIDS, I HAVE KIDS-- I'M JUST KIDDING, OF COURSE.
HOMEWORK IS INCREDIBLYIMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY THE
WORKSHEETS -- OH, THEWORKSHEETS.
ALRIGHT. GO AHEAD. SORRY.
(LAUGHTER)>> SEE, K-12, WE HAVE LOTS OF
PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION, BUTCOLLEGE EDUCATION, REMEMBER, THE
UNITED STATES STILL IS THE BESTANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
WE LEAD THE WORLD IN HIGHEREDUCATION.
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLDWANT TO COME HERE AND GET THE
KIND OF LIBERAL EDUCATIONTHAT ALL THESE GOVERNORS ARE
TRYING TO DEFUND.
>> Jon: BUT AREN'T THEY'RECOMING HERE AND NOT GETTING
LIBERAL EDUCATION, THEY'RE COMEHERE FOR OUR STEM PROGRAMS.
>> NO, A LOT OF THEM, FIRST,REMEMBER, EVEN AT A PLACE LIKE
M.I.T., I GOT A WONDERFUL EMAILFROM THE PRESIDENT AT M.I.T.
WHO SAID LOOK -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE TEACH STEM BUT WE MAKESURE THAT KIDS TAKE LOTS OF
CLASSES IN NON-STEM SUBJECTS. SOYOU COULD BE DOING ENGINEERING
AT ANY MAJOR UNIVERSITY IN THEUNITED STATES --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU'LL BE TAKING LOTS OFCLASSES IN HISTORY AND
ENGLISH AND THINGS LIKE THATBECAUSE THE WHOLE IDEA, LOOK,
IN THE 19th CENTURY, EUROPEANCOUNTRIES LIKE BRITAIN AND
FRANCE SAID DECIDED WE'REGOING TO STREAM KIDS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AT 15, 16 THEY HAVE TO CHOOSEWHAT TRADE THEY'RE GOING TO GO
INTO.>> Jon: YES, WE SHOULD DO THAT.
>> AMERICA SAID NO.
>> Jon: NO, WE SHOULDN'T DOTHAT.
>> WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ABROAD, GENERAL EDUCATION.
>> Jon: YES.
>> BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED THEBASIC SKILLS THAT WILL HELP YOU
FOR NOT YOUR FIRST JOB,BUT YOUR SIXTH, YOUR TENTH
JOB AND THAT HAS BEEN MUCHMORE SUCCESSFUL.
>> Jon: SO THEY'RE PLANNING ONYOU GETTING FIRED A LOT!
SEE, HERE'S WHAT I'M SAYING --WHY NOT --
>> LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RELEAVING YOUR JOB.
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU THIS, ISTARTED OUT --
>> YOU NEED TO RETOOL.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO COMMUNITYCOLLEGE!
(LAUGHTER)I STARTED OUT, I WAS A CHEMISTRY
MAJOR FOR TWO YEARS. BUT THEYALWAYS --
(AUDIENCE -- WHOO! ] NO WHOO!
(LAUGHTER)THEY ALWAYS WANTED THE RIGHT
ANSWER.
THEN I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY MAJORBECAUSE THEY JUST WANTED AN
ANSWER -- AND I THOUGHT, WELL,THAT I CAN THROW OUT EIGHT
PAGES. THE THING I WORRY ABOUTIS NOT --
>> AND, AND IT'S WORKED OUTPRETTY WELL.
>> Jon: IT HAS BUT IT HASNOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
I WORRY ABOUT THE TEACHERS.
FOR ME, IT'S ALL ABOUT THETEACHERS.
HELP THE TEACHERS, AND THEYWILL IN TURN -- WE PUT SO MUCH
PRESSURE ON THEM FOR THESERIDICULOUS TESTS, FOR THESE
STANDARDIZED CORE COMPETENCIES,FOR ALL THESE THINGS,
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO LEARN,THEN YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM
MENTORS AND TEACHERS.
WE NEED TO REVAMP THE ENTIRE WAYIN WHICH WE VIEW IT.
>> I TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOKWHERE I USED TO THINK  --
>> Jon: OH, I'VE READ THIS. IT'SA BEAUTIUL -- I'M WAITING FOR
THE MOVIE USUALLY, BUT THIS IS--
>> MAYBE YOU COULD DIRECT IT.
>> Jon: I WOULD LOVE TO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> I USED TO THINK THAT I WOULD
LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW, VERYTRADITIONAL CORE CURRICULUM
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHAT I REALIZED NOW IS YOUREALLY WANT A GREAT TEACHER --
>> Jon: YES.
>> WHO ARE INSPIRES INYOU THE LOVE OF LEARNING.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.
>> AND IF WHAT THEY'RETEACHING YOU IS --
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A15-YEAR-OLD BOY, GIVE THEM
"PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT,"GIVE THEM YOU KNOW
"GOODBYE COLUMBUS,"
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> YEAH, GIVE THEM STUFF THATWILL EXCITE THEM.
>> Jon: TEACH THEM AT 15 HOWTO HAVE SEX WITH LIVER?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?
>> EXACTLY, EXACTLY! BECAUSETHEY WILL LEARN,
THEY WILL FIND GREAT LITERATUREINTERESTING.
>> Jon: BUT HERE'S, BUT HERE'SMY POINT,
THE ONLY THING THAT HASN'TCHANGED IS THE PARADIGM OF
EDUCATION.
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, DOWE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE IN PLACE
AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED, WHAT IFTHEY DONE WITH EDUCATION?
IT'S THE SAME STRUCTURE, JUSTNOW THEY HAVE iPadS.
>> NO, NO, WHAT IS IS CHANGINGFOR THE FIRST TIME.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND I TALKABOUT IT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> MOOCS ARE REALLY BIG.
>> Jon: DON'T USE THOSE TYPE OFTERMS. THAT'S --
>> NO, NO, NO, OKAY, MASSIVEONLINE COURSES
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT --
>> Jon: OH, THANK GOD --I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
ME GROWING UP IN NEWJERSEY.
>> NO.
>> Jon: I APOLOGIZE. (LAUGHTER)
>> EDUCATION IS BASICALLYUNCHANGED FOR 3,000 YEARS.
RIGHT? I MEAN, THE WAY PLATOTAUGHT ARISTOTLE WAS BASICALLY A
GUY, TEACHER STANDS INFRONT OF THE GROUP OF STUDENTS,
TEACHES THEM, THAT'S BASICALLYWHAT COLLEGE SEMINAR IS TODAY,
3,000 YEARS LATER.>> Jon: YES.
>> ONLINE EDUCATION IS A GAMECHANGER BECAUSE WHAT'S IT'S
DOING IS FIRST OF ALL,YOU'RE GETTING THESE COURSES
ACROSS TO THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OFTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
THERE'S THIS YALE PROFESSOR WHOTAUGHT A CLASS,
NOBLE-PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST,HE DID THE FIRST ONLINE COURSE.
IN THE FIRST YEAR THE NUMBER OFPEOPLE WHO FINISHED THE COURSE
COMPLETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTSWAS MORE THAN HE TAUGHT IN HIS
35 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT, IN THATONE YEAR.
>> Jon: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
>> SO THAT'S ONE.THE SECOND PIECE IS THAT WHAT
ALL THE PEOPLE, HUNDREDS OFTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TAKING
THESE COURSES MEANS -->> Jon: YES.
>> IS YOU GET INCREDIBLE DATA.
WHAT WE START TO LEARN IS WHY DOPEOPLE NOT UNDERSTAND THE SECOND
MODULE,  WHY ARE THEY DOINGBADLY ON THIS, YOU KNOW,
ON QUESTION NUMBER TWO?
YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY DIRECT THEMTO A QUICK REMEDIAL.
SO EVEN THOUGH THE EDUCATION ISNOW MASS AND MASSIVE, IT'S MORE
PERSONALIZED BECAUSE WE NOWKNOW, BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS DATA.
PEOPLE WHO DO BADLY ON THESECOND QUIZ, THE REASON IS THEY
HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD THIS MODULE.
SO IT'S WEIRDLY YOU ARE ACTUALLYPRODUCING MASSIVE SCALE BUT
CUSTOMIZATION AT THE SAME TIME.
>> Jon: WELL, NOW WE SEEM LIKEWE'RE AT ODDS.
NOW WE SEEM LIKE -- ISN'T THATMUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE?
WE NEED MORE TEACHERS, BETTERTEACHERS, NO MORE TEACHERS.
>> NO, NO, NO. YOU ALWAYSNEED TEACHERS.
>> Jon: YES.
>> BUT WHAT YOU'RE FINDING ISTHAT THESE TEACHERS YOU WORK
WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY MUCH, MUCHBETTER.
>> Jon: THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT.
>> I KNOW YOUR MOM WAS ATEACHER.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S, IJUST WAS A LITTLE BIT.
>> I'M VERY RESPECTFUL OF THAT.
>> Jon: I'M A LITTLE DEFENSIVEABOUT IT!
THAT'S ALL.
(APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT.
"IN DEFENSE OF A LIBERALEDUCATION" IT'S ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW.
IF YOU TAKE FAREED'S ONLINECOURSE, THIS COMES TO LIFE!
FAREED ZAKARIA, ALWAYS APLEASURE.
>> THANK YOU.
