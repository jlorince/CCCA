>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE
DAILY SHOW!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BOOM!
LISTEN, FOR THE NEXT-- THANK
YOU VERY MUCH, FOR THE NEXT
22 MINUTES OR SO I WILL BE
THE HOST OF THIS DAMN
PROGRAM.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT, YOU
KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF
IMPORTANT STORIES IN THE
WORLD RIGHT NOW.
AND I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR
EVERYBODY, ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT STORIES IS
HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN NEW
YORK CITY.
>> AN AMBITIOUS PLAN
ALLOWING NEW YORKERS TO
SHARE BIKES BEGINS TODAY IN
THE BIG APPLE.
STARTS WITH 6,000 SHINE EYE
NEW BIKES STATIONED IN
MANHATTAN AN BROOKLYN.
HALF HALF:
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: 6,000 SHINY NEW
BIKES, BY TOMORROW, 3,000,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, A BICYCLE SHARE,
THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.
WHERE DOES THAT IDEA COME
FROM.
>> THEY'RE ON THE STREETS OF
PARIS, BARCELONA AND
MONTREAL, AND NOW NEW YORK
CITY.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD!
WE HAVE BASICALLY IMPORTED
EUROPE'S MOST BORING IDEA.
(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, I GOT AN IDEA, WHY
DON'T YOU KEEP YOUR [BLEEP]
LOUVRE AND WHATEVER YOUR
PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDE IS
TOWARDS SEXUAL FREEDOM, JUST
GIVE US YOUR [BLEEP] BIKE,
THAT'S ALL WE WANT.
WE WANT TO PEDAL AROUND A
LITTLE BIT AND SEE WHAT WE
CAN DO THERE.
WE DON'T WANT YOUR HEALTH
CARE, WE JUST WANT THOSE
[BLEEP].
FIRST OF ALL.
THE IDEA OF NEW YORKERS
SHARING ANYTHING OTHER THAN
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
DISEASES--
(LAUGHTER)
>> IS BACK ADO.
-- WACKADOO.
HOW DOES IT WORK.
>> THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED FOR
ANNUAL MEMBERS LAST WEEK
WITHOUT PAY $95 A YEAR FOR
UNLIMITED 45 MINUTE RIDES.
>> Jon: RECEIPT ME STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.
WHAT IS AN UNLIMITED 45
MINUTE RIDE.
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE
LIMIT IS 45 MINUTES.
LIKE PROMISING THREE MINUTE
ETERNITY.
LADIES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DID I SAY 3, I WAS THINKING
OF THE METRIC SYSTEM, IT'S
REALLY ONLY-- I THINK IT
TRANSLATES TO ONE AND A
HALF.
BUT WHO KNOWS?
THIS COULD BE GREATMENT
MAYBE THESE 6,000 NEW
BICYCLISTS ON MANHATTAN
STREETS EVERY DAY ARE MORE
SKILLED AND SAVVY THAN WE
THINK.
HOW'S IT GOING.
>> NOT EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO
RIDE.
THAT'S WHY VOLUNTEERS ARE
RUNNING FREE WORKSHOPS LIKE
THIS ONE.
>> HELMETS ARE ENCOURAGED
BUT NOT REQUIRED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO DIE.
(LAUGHTER)
NO, THAT SOUNDS-- SO THEY'RE
LEARNING HOW TO BIKE AND
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
HELMETS.
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT GIVES ME
A MONEYMAKING IDEA.
NO, NO, NO, I SAID
MONEYMAKING.
YEAH!
GRAY MAT CERTIFICATE NO
MATTER WHAT JOHNNIE SUE'S
STREET BRAIN REMOVAL
SERVICE.
THE SECRET INGREDIENT IS
