WELCOME BACK, MY GUESTTONIGHT, THE MANAGING
DIRECTOR OF THEINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND,
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM, CHRISTINE LAGARDE.
HELLO.
THIS --(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: YOU FIND THAT IIMAGINE EVERYWHERE.
(LAUGHTER)ANY TIME THE INTERNATIONAL
MONETARY FUND IS OUT THERE.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY, IT'S AVERY BUSY TIME FOR THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.AND I FEEL OBVIOUSLY STUPID
ASKING THIS, CANI HAVE $10 BILLION?
I WOULD LIKE TO BUY CNN ANDFUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM
IT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)LET'S START WITH THIS.
SO THERE IS THIS NEW IMFINITIATIVE ABOUT GENDER
EQUALITY.
ABOUT GETTING WOMEN INTO THEWORKFORCE AROUND THE WORLD.
HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT?
WHAT IS THIS?
>> TRYING TO CLOSE THEGENDER GAP.
THAT IS, THAT IS WHAT WE ARESTUDYING.
BECAUSE WHEREVER WE GO, ANDWE'VE STUDIED A 150 COUNTRIES,
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING,NOT VERY CLEAR SOMETIMES,
SOMETIMES VERY EXPLICIT, THATWILL PREVENT WOMEN FROM ENTERING
THE JOB MARKET.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> FROM CONTRIBUTING TO THEECONOMY,
AND FROM ACTUALLY CHOOSINGWHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE AWOMAN CANNOT OPEN A BANK
ACCOUNT WITHOUT HAVINGSUPERVISION, AUTHORIZATION AND
THE SIGNATURE OF SOMEONE ELSE.THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE A
WOMAN CANNOT INHERITTHE SAME WAY HER BROTHER
WOULD INHERIT.
THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE WOMENCANNOT HOLD ASSETS OR
PROPERTY AND THEREFORETHEY CANNOT, YOU KNOW,
TAKE OUT A LOAN ANDSTART A BUSINESS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. OR DRIVE. THEYCAN'T, I MEAN, IN THE MORE
FUNDAMENTALIST --
>> THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHEREIT IS, WHERE IT IS ABOUT
DRIVING.
>> Jon: COUNTRIES WE MIGHTEVEN BE ALLIED WITH.
IN A VERY BIZARRE WAY.
>> YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ISAMAZING ABOUT THIS STUDY --
>> Jon: YEAH.>> IS THAT 90% OF
THE 150 COUNTRIES HAVE ATLEAST ONE OBSTACLE.
ONE LEGAL LITTLE HURDLE THATIS GOING TO PREVENT WOMEN
FROM DOING WHAT THEY WANT TODO.
>> Jon: SO THE IDEA IS THEINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
PUTS PRESSURE ON THEM TOREMOVE THAT LEGAL HURDLE,
EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BEOTHER CULTURAL ISSUES THAT
WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED?>> NO, IT'S THEIR CHOICE.
BUT I THINK OUR JOB IS TOSHOW HOW IT HAS AN IMPACT ON
THEIR ECONOMY.
>> Jon: THAT IT WILL GROWTHEIR ECONOMY.
>> YES. I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE.JAPAN.
JAPAN HAS AN AGINGPOPULATION.
AND THEY HAVE AN ISSUEBECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH, YOU KNOW, WORKING FORCE.
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGHPEOPLE TO DO THE WORK.
AND YET THEY HAVE VERYTALENTED JAPANESE WOMEN
OFTEN BETTER EDUCATED THANMEN.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE BARRIERIN JAPAN?
>> LOTS OF HURDLES.
>> Jon: IS THERE A HURDLE?
>> JAPAN IT'S CHILDCARE CENTERS. NONEXISTENT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> CULTURAL ISSUESTHAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT WHEN WE SHOWED THE STUDYTO THE PRIME MINISTER, AND
WE SHOWED HIM HOW MUCH HECOULD GROW THE ECONOMY IF HE
ALLOWED WOMEN TO ACTUALLYHAVE CHILD CARE CENTERS
AVAILABLE, ELIMINATESOME OF THE BARRIERS.
HE SAID, WELL, LET'S TRY TO WORKON THAT.
AND THEY'VE PUT A REALLYSIGNIFICANT BUDGET OUT THERE
TO OPEN CHILD CARE CENTERS, TOALLOW WOMEN TO TRY.
>> Jon: SO, YOU'VE SEEN REALCHANGE THEN FROM THIS
PROGRAM.
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: ARE YOU-- NOW WHATABOUT COUNTRIES LET'S SAY
THAT WOMEN ARE ABLE TO WORKIN, BUT WHEN THEY DO, THEY
MIGHT BE PAID, LET'S SAY ALITTLE BIT LESS OR A LOT
LESS AND THEN THEY WOULDLIKE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT
AT AN AWARD SHOW AND THENSOME PEOPLE WOULD CLAP.
BUT THEN, BUT THEN AFTERTHAT, A BUNCH OF OTHER
PEOPLE WOULD GET REALLY MADABOUT THAT YOU KNOW, WHY IS
THIS SUCH AN EXPLOSIVEISSUE?
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ASIMPLE CLEAR-CUT MEASURE OF
EQUALITY THAT IS VERYDIFFICULT TO ARGUE IN ANY
KIND OF RATIONAL SENSE.
>> AND YET IT'S ALL OVER THEPLACE.
>> Jon: THIS IS WHAT I'MSAYING.
>> THE GENDER GAP ISANYWHERE BETWEEN, YOU KNOW,
12ISH TO OVER 25% DEPENDING ONWHICH COUNTRY YOU LOOK AT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. AS THEHEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL
MONETARY FUND -->> YEAH.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW HOWCOMFORTABLE I AM WITH YOU
USING AN "ISH"(LAUGHTER)
IN TERMS OF YOUR STATISTICS,I WOULD LIKE TO SEE-- IT'D BE
LIKE THIS, SO HOW'S IS THEGREEK BAILOUT GOING,
OH, WE'RE THINKING ABOUT$6 BILLION-ISH, YOU KNOW.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORESPECIFIC HERE.
>> ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT.
>> Jon: SPEAKING OF WHICH,TODAY IS THE DAY, THE DEADLINE.
GREECE WAS TO HAND IN THEIRLIST OF REFORMS TO THE
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND -->> YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU FLOATED THEM A LOANTO KEEP THEM AFLOAT
WHILE THEY WERE GOING. WHATDOES THE LIST SAY?
WHAT ARE THE REFORMS THATTHEY'RE GOING TO MAKE?
>> WELL, AT THIS POINT IN TIME,I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LIST YET.
SO I KNOW THEY'RE WORKING ONIT AND I KNOW THEY ARE VERY
SERIOUS ABOUT PUTTING INPLACE A LIST OF REFORMS.
>> Jon: YES. BUT IT IS DUETODAY.
>> THAT THEY THINK WILL BEHELPFUL FOR THE ECONOMY.
IT'S DUE TODAY.>> Jon: IT'S DUE TODAY.
>> NOW YOU KNOW, MAYBE THEY'RETHINKING --
>> Jon: IT'S DUE TODAY.
>> CLOSE OF BUSINESSON THE WEST COAST.
>> Jon: YES. YES.
OR, OR, OR, THEYCOULD HAVE NOT DONE IT.
>> NO, I THINK-- I REALLYTHINK THAT THEY ARE WORKING
ON IT.
AND I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WEARE ABLE TOMORROW MORNING TO
TELL THEM WHAT WE THINK OFIT.
WHICH MEANS THAT WE'RE GOINGTO WORK OVERNIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT A SIMPLE, A SIMPLETHING, THIS IS A SOLUTION,
AGAIN, I'M NOT ANECONOMIST.
GET RID OF HALF OF THEIRCONSONANTS AND I THINK,
THINK OF THE MONEY YOU SAVEON JUST PRINTING SIGNS IN
GREECE.
SOMOPOLOPOLOUS BECOMES.
SOMEI.
STICK AROUND FOR FIVEMINUTES.
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOUHAVE TO AND WE'LL TALK A
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEIMF AND THE THINGS THAT THEY
ARE DOING.
CHRISTINE LAGARDE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
