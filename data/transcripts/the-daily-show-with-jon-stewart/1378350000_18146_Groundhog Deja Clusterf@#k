BOMBING SYRIA WHICH ULTIMATELY
ARE REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.

CHOICE OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE FOR
THEIR FUTURE.

WILLINGLY, DEMOCRATIC SYRIA IS
STABLE AND PEACEFUL, THOUSANDS
OF LIVES ARE SAVED AND A AND
THEY GET MARRIED AND LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH UNICORNS
AND RAINBOWS!

SURE IT IS AN ARDUOUS TASK,
COMPLEX TASK THE COMMITTEE
MEMBERS THAT WERE LISTENING TO
OUR COMMITTEE CHAIR THERE,
MR. CHAIR, OUR SECRETARY OF
STATE RIGHTFULLY AGONIZED OVER

IS ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED IN
MY CAREER IT IS THIS.
THE JOKE ALWAYS LANDS BETTER IF
YOU REPEAT IT A SECOND TIME.
YOU KNOW, LIKE A LOOP.
MAN, IT SEEMS LIKE NO A MATTER
WHAT WE DO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IT
IS LIKE WE ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF
IT.
IT IS LIKE WE WRITE THE SCRIPT
IN AMERICA AND JUST HEAD TO THE
MIDDLE EAST, SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT
OF TIME THERE AND QUITE A BIT OF
MONEY AND COME BACK AND FINALLY
GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU
SHOT AND IT TURNS OUT IT IS
(BLEEP) SUCKS, THREE MONTHS AND
FLIES OVER THE MIDDLE EAST AND

HOUR MOVING ABOUT THREE GUYS
SITTING IN A PRISON CELL, I AM
NOT GOING BACK THERE, YOU HEAR
ME!  STILL PULLING PIECES OF
THAT OUT OF MY ASS.
>> ANYWAY, THAT IS SYRIA.
JUST A GENERAL ANALOGY.
WE TRIED EVERYTHING.
SANCTIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
CRUISE, EXPLICIT AND NOT AS
EXPLICIT.
WE EVEN TRIED IGNORING THE
REGION AND PRETENDING THE
ATROCITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH US.
>> WE EVEN ATTEMPTED DIALOGUE.
EVERY EIGHT YEARS OR SO.
>> EVERY EIGHT YEARS OR SO.
AH, THERE WE GO.
I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.
IT IS LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE A
SUPERPOWER WE HAVEN'T FIGURED
OUT YET WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE
SUPERPOWERS.
BUT WE JUST KEEP JUMPING OUT OF
THE BUILDING THINKING WE ARE
GOING TO FLY!  YOU COME OUT OF
THE PHONE BOOTH AND TEAR YOUR
SUIT OFF AND YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU
ARE (BLEEP) CLARK KENT.
THERE IS NOTHING THERE AFTER
