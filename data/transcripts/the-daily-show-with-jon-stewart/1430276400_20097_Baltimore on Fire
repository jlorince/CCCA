THAT.(LAUGHTER)
AND IT ONLY GETS BETTER FROMHERE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE TOPSTORY.
THE LAWLESS, DESTRUCTIVE RIOTSSHAKING OUR NATION, OH, NO,
THOSE ARE KENTUCKY FANS, I'MSORRY, AFTER LOSING,
THE LAWLESS -- NO, I'MSORRY, THAT'S THE MICHIGAN FANS
AFTER WINNING, NO I AM SORRY,THAT'S A PUMPKIN FESTIVAL
GONE AWRY, COME ON, THOSE AREKIDS JUST BLOWING OFF STEAM
WITH GOOD-NATURED ARSON. THEREYOU GO! THAT'S THE WORRISOME,
LET'S CALL IT URBAN VIOLENCE WEWERE LOOKING FOR.
>> IT HAS BEEN A NIGHT OF CHAOS,VIOLENCE, LAWLESSNESS IN
BALTIMORE OVER THEDEATH OF FREDDIE GRAY.
>> RIGHT NOW THE NATIONAL GUARDIS ON THE SCENE TRYING TO
RESTORE PEACE AND AS WE SAID ALLPUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED
TODAY.
>> Jon: BUT -- AH, -- (BLEEP).
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S PROBABLYTHE ONE TIME EVEN KIDS DON'T
EVEN WANT TO HEAR THEANNOUNCEMENT SCHOOL IS CLOSED.
HONEY, NO SCHOOL! YOU HAVE ARIOT DAY.
JUST STAY IN YOUR PJS AND WATCHYOUR FAVORITE CARTOONS.
BE PREEMPTED BY FOOTAGE OF OURNEIGHBORHOOD IN FLAMES.
YES, ONCE AGAIN THE COMBINATIONOF AN ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING
INNER CITY, POLICE FORCE CHARGEDWITH KEEPING ITS CITIZENS OUT OF
EVERYONE ELSE'S VIEW HASCOMBUSTED, LIKE WATTS AND
DETROIT IN THE SIXTIES, GEORGIAIN THE SEVENTIES,
MIAMI IN THE EIGHTIES, L.A.AND ST. PETERSBERG IN THE
NINETIES, THE CYCLICAL ERUPTIONSAPPEAR LIKE TRAGEDY CICADAS.
DEPRESSING IN THEIR SIMILARITY,PREDICTABILITY AND
INTRACTABILITY, OR TO PUT THATANOTHER WAY --
>> HARD TO BELIEVE.
THIS IS GOING ON IN A MAJORAMERICAN CITY RIGHT NOW, THIS IS
A SCENE THAT A LOT OF US NEVERANTICIPATED SEEING IN A CITY
LIKE BALTIMORE, HARD TO BELIEVETHIS IS GOING ON AS I KEEP
SAYING IN A MAJOR AMERICAN CITY.
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEINGANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA IN A LONGTIME.
>> Jon: ELVIS LEADING A HERDOF ORTHODOX JEWISH UNICORNS
THROUGH A CITY STREET, THATWOULD BE HARD TO BELIEVE.
THIS (BLEEP), THIS (BLEEP)HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
FERGUSON WAS JUST A FEW MONTHSAGO AND YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT IT.
>> IT IS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVETHAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE, 2014,
SO MANY YEARS AFTER DR. MARTINLUTHER KING AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS
MOVEMENT WE ARE SEEING NATIONALGUARD TROOPS ON THE STREET TO
PREVENT THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE INTHIS DAY AND AGE, IT'S SOMETHING
I DIDN'T THINK WE WOULDBE SEEING AGAIN.
>> Jon: I AM WORRIED ABOUTYOU.
DO I NEED TO GET SANDLER TO GOOVER TO YOUR HOUSE AND -- JUST
RUN (BLEEP) BY YOU EVERYMORNING.
WELL LOOK, BLITZER MAY HAVE BEENTAKEN OFF GUARD BUT CERTAINLY
THE MAYOR OF BALTIMORE WOULDN'TBE TAKEN OFF GUARD.
>> I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITHOUR GOVERNOR AND HE HAS AGREED,
AND I HAVE REQUESTED AND HE HASAGREED TO DEPLOY THE NATIONAL
GUARD.
>> WHEN THE MAYOR CALLED ME,WHICH QUITE FRANKLY WE WERE GLAD
THAT SHE FINALLY DID, INSTANTLYWE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.
>> Jon: OH, OH, OH.
WELL, ISN'T THE GOVERNOR ALITTLE BIT PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE?
I MEAN I WAS THERE ALLWEEKEND.
BY THE PHONE, BUT FINE, IF SHEWANTS THE CITY TO BURN?
WHO AM I, I'M JUST A SIMPLEGOVERNOR WITH EXECUTIVE
AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE A STANDINGARMY OF RESERVISTS?
BUT I GUESS CALLING THEM OUTWOULD NOT BE ON FLEEK AS THE
YOUNG PEOPLE --(LAUGHTER)
YOU MOTHER (BLEEP), YOU SWORETHAT THAT'S A THING!
YOU SWORE THAT ON FLEEK WAS ATHING.
THEY SWORE TO ME. I SAID, ONFLEEK?
AND THEY SAID, NO, THAT'S ATHING. I WAS LIKE --
I AM GOING TO (BLEEP) PUNT YOUMOTHER (BLEEP).
I KNOW THAT'S A THING.
I KNOW THAT'S A THING.
SO TO THE MAYOR WAS A LITTLELATE WITH HER EMERGENCY STATE
DECLARING.
WHEN SHOULD SHE HAVE DONE IT?
>> THERE IS A STATE OF EMERGENCYAFTER A NIGHT OF VIOLENCE AND
CHAOS.
WAS BALTIMORE CAUGHT OFF GUARD?
>> THAT CALL SHOULD HAVE CAME INTWO OR THREE DAYS AGO.
>> WHY WAS THIS NOT IN PLACESATURDAY OR SUNDAY WHEN THE
SITUATION BEGAN?
>> Jon: WELL, SURE, NO, THEYCOULD HAVE DECLARED A STATE OF
EMERGENCY IN BALTIMORE ONSUNDAY, MAYBE SATURDAY, OR MAYBE
SOMEWHERE IN THE 1970S.
AND THIS SEEMS TO INDICATETHE ISSUE IN OUR CITY EMERGENCY
ALERT SYSTEM.
THERE APPEAR TO BE ONLY TWOPOINTS ON THE SCALE, NORMAL AND
ON FIRE.
EVEN VOLCANOES HAVE A FOURSTEP WARNING SYSTEM.
IT DOESN'T GO FROM CLEAR SKYTO, THE FLOOR IS LAVA! AND
CLEARLY BALTIMORE WAS BELCHINGSMOKE FAR BEFORE SATURDAY.
>> BALTIMORE'S POVERTY RATE ISNEARLY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL
AVERAGE.
>> AGAIN, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATEAMONG YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN
HOVERS AROUND 30 PERCENT.
>> HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATESFOR BLACK MALES ARE
DEVASTATINGLY LOW.
>> A LACK OF ACCESS TO LABORMARKETS, HEALTH CARE, HOUSING.
>> HAS CHRONIC SEVERE DRUG ANDCRIME ISSUES.
>> ONE OF THE HIGHEST VIOLENTCRIME RATES IN AMERICA.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW YOUR CITY IS(BLEEP)ED UP WHEN IT IS LAST
MOST SUCCESSFUL EMPLOYMENTPROGRAM WAS CASTING EXTRAS FOR A
TELEVISION SHOW ABOUT HOW(BLEEP) UP YOUR CITY IS.
AND WHEN GETTING ARRESTED -- ANDWHEN GETTING ARRESTED IS ONE OF
YOUR MORE RELIABLY LUCRATIVEOPTIONS.
>> SINCE 2011, THE CITY OFBALTIMORE HAS PAID OUT CLOSE TO
$6 MILLION IN COURT JUDGMENTS ORSETTLEMENTS TO VICTIMS OF POLICE
ABUSE.
>> Jon: THE POLICE BRUTALITYLOTTERY IS NOW $6 MILLION! ALL
YOU NEED IS A BROKENTAILLIGHT AND A DREAM.
AND TO THE POLICE'S DEFENSE,HEY, IT'S (BLEEP) TRUE.
THEY PAID OUT $6 MILLION.
I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP.
AND BY THE WAY, TO THE POLICE'SDEFENSE, IT IS NOT REALLY THEIR
JOB TO FIX THE WHOLE MESS.
>> THIS HAS BEEN OUR RESPONSE TOCOMMUNITIES ASKING FOR
RESOURCES.
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ESSENTIALLYBECOME A SURROGATE FOR JOBS,
HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION AND ALLTHE THINGS THESE COMMUNITIES
NEED TO BE HEALTHY.
>> Jon: IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.
MAYBE A MORE NUANCED ALERTSYSTEM COULD ALLOW FOR MORE
PRODUCTIVE INTERVENTION BEYOND,YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO
DISPERSE.
OR WE CAN AGREE TO KEEP IGNORINGTHE ROOTS OF HOW SYSTEMICALLY
HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISEDMANY AFRICAN-AMERICAN
COMMUNITIES STILL ARE ONLYPAYING ATTENTION TO THEM
WHEN WE FEAR THEIRFIERY BALL OF ANGER THREATENS
TO ENTER OUR AIRSPACE.
LIKE SOME KIND OF ALEX HALEY'SCOMET, AND ONCE AGAIN, BREATHING
A BLISSFUL SIGHT OF FORGETFULRELIEF WHEN IT IS ANOTHER NEAR
MISS.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
