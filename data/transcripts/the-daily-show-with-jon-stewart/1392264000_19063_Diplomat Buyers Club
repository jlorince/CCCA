>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THE OTHER DAY -- THE OTHER DAY
ON THE PROGRAM DEMOCRATIC HOUSEMINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI WAS
HERE.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUTCORRUPTION.
I WAS SAYING MONEY HAS CORRUPTEDWASHINGTON.
AND THEN SHE WAS SAYING NO, ITHASN'T.
AND I WAS LIKE, I'M PRETTY SUREIT HAS.
[LAUGHTER]AND THEN SHE WAS LIKE, WELL,
MAYBE FOR THE REPUBLICANS ITHAS.
AND I HAD NOT REALIZED THAT THEDEMOCRATS WERE IMPERVIOUS TO
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S CHARMS, IFYOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT MONEY.
[ LAUGHTER ]MAKING IT RAIN THAT SORT OF
THING.
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT THEDEMOCRATS AREIMPERVIOUS TO THAT SO WE DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS THEDEMOCRATS ARE IN CHARGE OF.
FOR INSTANCE, THE AMBASSADORS.
APPOINTED BY THE DEMOCRATICPRESIDENT.
SURELY HE CHOOSES THEM ON THEIRMERITS.
>> HE HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR THEAMBASSADORSHIP TO NORWAY.
>> HAVE YOU BEEN TO NORWAY? IHAVE NOT.
>> Jon: OKAY.
A LITTLE WEIRD.
HE HAS NEVER VISITED THE COUNTRYHE IS GOING TO BE THE NEW
AMBASSADOR TO THIS DESPITE THETOURISM CAMPAIGN COME TO NORWAY,
YOU MAY BE OUR AMBASSADOR SOMEDAY.
BUT WHO NEEDS TO GO TO NORWAY TOUNDERSTAND IT ANYWAY.
YOU USED A NORDIC TRACK YOUBASICALLY BEEN THERE.
IT'S FINE.
>> HAVE YOU BEEN TO ARGENTINA?
>> SENATOR, I HAVEN'T BEEN THEREYET.
I HAVE TRAVELED EXTENSIVELYAROUND THE WORLD BUT I HAVEN'T
YET HAD A CHANCE.
>> Jon: IT'S AH, TO BEPERFECTLY HONEST, LAST ON MY
LIST. WOULD YOU SAYIT'S KIND OF A MERDAHOLE.
YOU KNOW.
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO ARGENTINABUT YOU'VE BEEN SOMEWHERE.
I WAS IN CANCUN AND I DATED AGIRL NAMED TINA IS THAT GOOD?
SURELY THE GUY THEADMINISTRATION IS SENDING TO
ICELAND HE HAS TO BE AN ICELAND-AHOLIC.
>> I TAKE IT YOU'VE BEEN TOICELAND.
>> SIR, I'VE NOT HAD THEPRIVILEGE YET.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HAVE ANY OF YOU (bleep) PEOPLEBEEN TO EPCOT CENTER?
IS THERE A RULE AMBASSADORSCAN'T HAVE SET FOOT IN THE
COUNTRIES THEY ARE GOING TOAMBASSADOR.
WOULD IT RUIN THE SURPRISE?
IT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE NEWNORWAY NOMINEE RAISED $850,000FOR
OBAMA'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN ORTHE ARGENTINA ONE RAISED
$500,000 OR THE ICE LANDIC ONEBUNDLED $1.6 MILLION. BECAUSE
THAT WOULD MEAN NOT ONLY WOULDDEMOCRATS BE SEEN AS
CORRUPT, NANCY PELOSI TOLD MEPERSONALLY THAT ONLY REPUBLICANSARE, AND IT WOULD ALSO MEAN
THAT ICELAND COST THREE TIMESMORE THAN ARGENTINA.
THAT IS NOT TO SAY ALLAMBASSADORSHIPS ARE UP TO THE
HIGHEST BIDDER.
NEW AMBASSADOR TO CHINA IS MAXBAUCUS I GUESS BECAUSE OF
SENSITIVITY OF THE POST.
>> I'M NO REAL EXPERT ON CHINA.
>> Jon: I'VE AH PLAYED THEIRCHECKERS.
[LAUGHTER]GOTTEN OUT OF THEIR FINGER
TRAPS.
SO --[LAUGHTER]
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT I CAN DOIT.
[ LAUGHTER ]TO BE FAIR TO BAUCUS HE DID NOT
RAISE MONEY FOR THE PRESIDENT.
HE STEPPED DOWN FROM THE SENATESO THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF
MONTANA COULD APPOINT HISREPLACEMENT MAKING IT EASIER FOR
THE DEMOCRATS TO KEEP THE SEATIN THE SENATE. YOU KNOW,NON-FINANCIAL CORRUPTION.
>> THERE IS AT LEAST ONEAMBASSADOR CHOSEN FOR HISQUALIFICATIONS. OUR MAN INMOSCOW, MICHAEL MCFAUL.
US AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA MICHAELMcFAUL WILL STEP DOWN.
>> I'VE BEEN COMMUTING 7 MONTHS.
IT'S A 5,000 MILE COMMUTE.
IT'S THE REASON I'M GOING HOME.
>> YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE TOCOMMUTE EVERY DAY.
HONEY I'M HOME.
HOLY (bleep) I HAVE TO GET THETO AIRPORT.
I'M 30 HOURS LATE FOR WORK.
NOW WE NEED A NEW RUSSIANAMBASSADOR.
WHY DON'T WE PROVE THE PROCESSISN'T CORRUPT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT RAISING MONEY FORTHE DEMOCRATS.
WHY CAN'T IT BE ABOUT PICKINGSOMEONE WE ARE NOT THAT CRAZY
ABOUT AND SENDING THEM AWAY.
HE SAID HE WANTED TO LEAVEANYWAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
