BEAUTIFUL IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ANGEL WITH THROAT CANCER.
DID HE.
HE SCREWED UP IN ENGLAND AND POLAND BUT HE MANAGED TO GO THERE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
OFFENSIVE OR HORRIBLE.
>> SPEAKING AT A FUND RAISER HE COMMENTED ON THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE
SURROUNDING PALESTINIAN AREA SAYING QUOTE DO YOU NOTICE SUCH A DRAMATICALLY STARK DIFFERENCE
IN ECONOMIC VITALITY, CULTURE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO CLOSE!
SO ROMNEY APPEARS TO BE SAYING THAT THE PALESTINIANS ARE PURELY THE ARCHITECT OF THEIR OWN
POVERTY, OR IF YOU PREFER TO LOOK AT THE CONVERSE THAT JEWS ARE JUST CULTURALLY MONEY-MAKING
MOTHER (bleep).
EITHER WAY MWAH!
MR. ROMNEY DOUBLED DOWN.
>> THIS MORNING HE SAID ISRAEL WAS MORE PROFITABLE BECAUSE IT HAD THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE.
>> Jon: HE APPEARS TO BE SAYING THAT WHILE PALESTINIAN ECONOMY HAS ROOTS IN THE CULTURE
GOD IS ALSO HOLDING THEM DOWN OR ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC PROGRESS IS
THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE AND I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT ALL THE HORRIBLE (bleep) THAT HAPPENED
TO THE JEWS PRIOR TO THAT WAS THE HAN OF PROVIDENCES MIDDLE FINGER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IN CASE YOU BELIEVE ROMNEY SIJELLING OUT ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS, HE IS NOT.
>> YOU NOTICE A STARK DINS IN ECONOMIC VITALITY, HE SAID AND THAT IS ALSO BETWEEN OTHER
COUNTRIES NEAR OR NEXT EACH OTHER, CHILE AND ECUADOR, MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES.
CULTURE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW LIKE MISSISSIPPI AND NEW YORK ROMNEY 012.
WE TURN TO AL MAGICAL.
HE'S IN THE WEST BANK.
AL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S COMMENTS ABOUT THESE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES?
>> HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, JON.
I MEAN IT'S GOT TO BET CULTURE.
LOOK AT THE WAY THESE PALESTINIANS LIVE.
I MEAN, THE HOUSE BEHIND ME LOOKS LIKE IT WAS HIT BY A BULLDOZER, RUBBLE EVERYWHERE.
STRAIGHTEN UP PEOPLE, ALL RIGHT?
>> Jon: I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE CRAZY ABOUT THE RUBBLE SITUATION EITHER.
>> RIGHT BUT A SUPERIOR CULTURE LIKE AMERICA OR ISRAEL WOULD SEE
THIS RUBBLE AND MAKE RUBBLE-ADE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOME TYPE OF RUBBLE-RELATED BUSINESSES, SURPLUS RUBBLE OUTLET STORE.
PRODUCE RUBBLE-RELATED TV SHOWS.
THIS OLD RUBBLE, FLIP THIS RUBBLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RUBBLE-HUNTER INTERNATIONAL.
THESE GUYS ARE LEAVING SCHEKLES.
I'D DO IT MYSELF BUT I'M MEXICAN.
AS GOVERNOR ROMNEY SAID I JUST DON'T HAVE THE CULTURE TO PULL IT OFF.
>> Jon: HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE WHILE YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE,
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY OTHER FACTORS OTHER THAN CULTURE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO
LESS THAN HEALTHY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE.
STARTS WITH AN O?
>> OH, YEAH THE ROADS.
IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE FOR.
ROADS ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU GET TO PLACES BUT PALESTINIANS THROW WALLS UP.
IT'S LIKE LIVING IN A MAZE.
NO WONDER TRAFFIC IS BACKED UP FOR MONTHS.
>> Jon: THOSE ARE CHECKPOINTS.
>> WHATEVER THEY ARE CALLED THE ADVANCED CULTURES HAVE SOMETHING CALLED EZ-PASS, ALL RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S --
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> I DON'T REMEMBER STOPPING EVERY 20 FEET ON THE JERSEY
TURNPIKE AND HAVING A GUY WITH A GUN PROBING ME DOO-DADS, ALL RIGHT?
THEY NEED BETTER CULTURE FRONTO.
>> Jon: THEY ARE NOT A CULTURAL PREFERENCE OF THE PALESTINIANS.
THE (bleep) THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ON A DAILY BASE.
>> JON, KISS MY ASS.
THIS SAY HOLY SITE, ALL RIGHT?
SHOW SOME RESPECT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SHOW SOME RESPECT AND SHUT THE (bleep) UP.
>> Jon: YOU SHUT THE (bleep) UP.
>> YOU ARE NOT A HOLY SITE.
>> Jon: EVERYTHING IS SAY HOLY SITE OVER THERE.
SHUT (bleep) (bleep).
>> JON, ALL I'M SAYING IS THIS -- CULTURE IS THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE
PALESTINIANS ARE LESS PROSPEROUS.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU PALESTINIANS LIVED AROUND HERE?
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
>> RIGHT, AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN COUNTRY.
ALL RIGHT, ISRAEL HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 60 YEARS AND COUNTING FLORIDA THEY HAVE TWO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: THANK YOU AL.
AL MAGICAL,
