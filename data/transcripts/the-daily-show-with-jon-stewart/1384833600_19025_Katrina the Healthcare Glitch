FAMEDCUB REPORTER JIMMY OLSEN.

BCOUPLE OF WEEKS FOR PRESIDENTHBARACK OBAMA.

GEORGE W. BUSH AS IN THEPROBLEMS WITH THE HEALTH CARE
PLAN HAVE BECOME PRESIDENTOBAMA'S KATRINA.
>> IS THIS OBAMA'S KATRINAMOMENT.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S KATRINAMOMENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: HURRICANE KATRINA?
I BELIEVE WE'VE ALL SEEN THEDAMNING PHOTOS OF PRESIDENTIAL
FLYOVER SURVEYING THE HUMANSUFFERING OF THE HEALTHCARE.GOV
WEB SITE FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.
I'M NOT TRYING TO POLISH THE DOTTURD THAT IS HEALTHCARE.GOV BUT
COMPARING THE GOVERNMENTABDICATION OF RESPONSIBILITY
DURING HURRICANE KATRINA, DEATHOF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, THE
DISPLACEMENT OF HUNDREDS OFTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO A
(bleep) WEB SITE IS OFFENSIVEAPPARENTLY TO THE PEOPLE IN
CHARGE DURING HURRICANE KATRINA.
C>> KATRINA WAS A REAL DISASTER.
BUT WE ALSO HADJURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGES
BECAUSE WE HAD A MAYOR.
WE HAD A GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANATHAT WAS A CHALLENGE TO WORK
WITH.
>> THAT IS ANDY CARD SAYING IT'SNOT FAIR TO PRESIDENT BUSH TO
COMPARE THE HEALTHCARE.GOVROLLOUT TO KATRINA BECAUSE
DURING KATRINA BUSH DIDN'T GETTHE COOPERATION OF LOUISIANA
GOVERNOR THE WAY OBAMA GETS ITNOW.
>> NOBODY IS GOING TO BULLYLOUISIANA INTO JOINING PART OF
OBAMACARE.
>> Jon: BULLYING?
THE FEDS WERE GOING TO PAY FORIT?
HOW WAS THAT BULLYING? HEYFOUREYES YOU NEED TO SEE AN
OPHTHALMOLOGIST SO WE CAN COVERTHAT THAT'S NOT ONLY REASON THE
COMPARISON IS UNFAIR TO GEORGEW. BUSH.
>> GEORGE BUSH DIDN'T INVENT AHURRICANE.
>> KATRINAWAS ONE
REGION.
>> LORD KNOWS YOU SAW HOW BADLYOUR GOVERNMENT RESPONDED.
IT BEGAN AND ENDED WITHIN AWEEK.
IT COULD EFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVESFOR YEARS TO COME.
>> Jon: SEE HOW YOU DISAPPOINTEDOUR AUDIENCE.
THEY THINK YOU MIGHT BE OUT OFYOUR (bleep) MIND.
I MEAN -- HURRICANE KATRINALASTED A WEEK AND EFFECTS OF
OBAMACARE.
SPIKE LEE'S DOCUMENTARY ABOUTKATRINA LASTED LONGER THAN A
WEEK.
