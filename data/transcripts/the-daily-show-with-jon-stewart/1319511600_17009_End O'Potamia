OUT.
NEXT STORY.
>> SO TODAY I CAN REPORT THAT
AS PROMISED, THE REST OF OUR
TROOPS IN IRAQ WILL COME HOME
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
AFTER NEARLY NINE YEARS,
AMERICA'S WAR IN IRAQ WILL BE
OVER.
>> Jon: IT'S OVER.
FIND ME...
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WOOO!
YES.
IT'S OVER.
IT'S FINALLY OVER.
OH, MAN.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
WOO-HOOO.
>> THEY EITHER FAILED TO DO IT
BY VIRTUE OF INEPTITUDE OR
THEY DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T
THAT IMPORTANT POLITICALLY OR
OTHERWISE.
>> THIS WAS A FAILURE BY THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO CLOSE
THE DEAL.
>> I THINK IT'S A SERIOUS
MISTAKE.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A
FAILURE WHEN IT COMES TO
FOREIGN POLICY.
>> Jon: BRINGING SOLDIERS
HOME.
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO COME AND
TAKE OUR JOBS.
YEAH, WHAT IS OBAMA DOING
PULLING OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ
BY THE END OF THE YEAR 2011.
WHO'S STUPID IDEA WAS THAT?
>> WE'RE HERE AT THE REQUEST
OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT, THE
ELECTED GOVERNMENT.
THERE ARE CERTAIN BENCHMARKS
THAT WILL BE MET SUCH AS
TROOPS OUT OF THE CITIES BY
JUNE OF '09.
THEN THERE'S A BENCHMARK AT
THE END OF THE AGREEMENT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THE STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT
BUSH SIGNED WITH THE IRAQIS.
I WONDER WHAT WAS THE
BENCHMARK AT THE END OF THAT
AGREEMENT THAT HE SIGNED WITH
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.
HERE IT IS.
ALL THE UNITED STATES FORCES
SHALL WITHDRAW NO LATER THAN
DECEMBER 31, 2011.
OOPS.
WHY DIDN'T THE POINT OF THAT
SPEECH GET MORE COVERAGE?
TODAY WE ARE REPORTING NEWS
THAT THE AMERICAN FORCES
PLEDGED TO LEAVE IRAQ BY--
SHOE!
DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE
DIFFERENT REASONS FOR
DISLIKING OBAMA'S RADICAL
DECISION TO DO THE THING
GEORGE BUSH SIGNED AN
AGREEMENT TO DO.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY TIME
WE HAVE DEPOSED A DICTATOR,
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS
LEFT TROOPS BEHIND TO BE ABLE
TO ENFORCE THE FRAGILE PEACE.
>> Jon: YOUR SEASON IS BUT WE
NEVER LEAVE COUNTRIES WE'VE
INVADED.
YOU MUST THEN BE HAPPY ABOUT
THE WAY THINGS WENT IN LIBYA.
WE GOT RID OF THE DICTATOR
WITHOUT EVER COMMITTING GROUND
FORS.
>> I OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT
PUTTING US INTO WAR IN LIBYA.
ONE THING WE SHOULD HAVE
LEARNED IN THE LAST 12 YEARS
IS THAT ONCE WE ARE INVOLVED
IN A FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT, IN A
FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENT, IT'S
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT.
IT'S USUALLY AT A GREAT PRICE.
>> Jon: AND I RESENT THIS
PRESIDENT HELPING TO DEPOSE
QADDAFI WITHOUT THE
COMPLICATIONS AND COSTS OF A
NEVER-ENDING OCCUPATION.
IT'S FRANKLY UNAMERICAN.
I WON'T STAND FOR IT.
BACHMANN'S OCCUPY WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT STREET PROTESTS
OVER OUR PULLOUT FROM IRAQ IS
AT LEAST MORE WELCOME THAN THE
BALLS OF SENATORS McCAIN AND
GRAHAM.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT MENTAL
IMAGE.
>> WELL I THINK IT'S A SERIOUS
MISTAKE.
I'M HERE IN THE REGION.
YES, IT IS VIEWED IN THE
REGION AS A VICTORY FOR THE
IRANIANS.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
DOUBT THERE.
>> THEY ENDD IRAQ POORLY
FUMBLED THE BALL INSIDE OF THE
TENT.
IT WAS HIS JOB, THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S JOB TO END
THIS WELL.
THEY FAILED.
>> Jon: YOU SEE IT WAS OUR JOB
TO START IT BADLY.
WE DID THAT.
WE WERE (BEEP) IDIOTS.
HIS JOB IS TO FINISH IT WELL.
THAT'S JUST HOW THINGS GO.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, SETTLE DOWN.
FOR THE GUYS WHO BEAR A GOOD
AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY
FORGETTING US INTO THIS (BEEP)
TO GO OUGHT WALDORF ON THE
EXIT, IT'S JUST LIKE THE
CAPTAIN OF THE EXXON VALDEZ
STANDING AROUND ALASKA GOING
YOU'RE SCRUBBING THE OIL OFF
THOSE BIRDS ALL WRONG.
YOU SHOULD BE USING STEEL WOOL
AND AJAX.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE
SCREWING UP THE ENVIRONMENT
LIKE THIS.
FOR GOD'S SAKES IN LIKE THREE
DAYS OBAMA HAS TAKEN US DOWN
FROM THREE WARS TO ONE.
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
ARE AMERICAS HAWKS HAVING
EMPTY NEST SYNDROME?
I KNOW IT'S HARD WHEN THEY
GROW UP.
BUT LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE AFGHANISTAN.
>> SPEAKING WITH A PRIVATE
PAKISTANI TELEVISION STATION
KARZAI SAID, QUOTE, THIS.
IF FIGHTING STARTS BETWEEN
PAKISTAN AND THE U.S., WE ARE
BESIDE PAKISTAN.
>> IF PAKISTAN IS ATTACKED AND
IF THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN NEED
AFGHANISTAN'S HELP,
AFGHANISTAN WILL BE THERE WITH
YOU.
>> Jon: AFGHANISTAN, THAT KID
IS GOING TO LIVE AT HOME
