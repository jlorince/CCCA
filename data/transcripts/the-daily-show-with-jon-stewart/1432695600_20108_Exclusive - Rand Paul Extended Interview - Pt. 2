>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE TALKING WITH SENATOR RANDPAUL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEINCONSISTENCIES.
YOU BROUGHT UP A POINT, SAIDTHEY'RE AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT
UNTIL THEY'RE FOR IT.
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THAT'SEVERYBODY, AND I ALMOST THINK,
THEN, I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THATIF THEY MADE THIS INDIVIDUAL
CASES.
YOU KNOW, THIS RELIGIOUS LIBERTYCASE IS AN INTERESTING ONE,
BECAUSE I REMEMBER BACK RIGHTAFTER 9/11 THEY HAD WHAT WAS
CALLED THE GROUND ZERO MOSQUE.
EVERYBODY WAS AGAINST THAT.
YOU CAN'T BUILD THAT.
MAYBE A QUESTION OF RELIGIOUSLIBERTY.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A GAYCOUPLE GETTING MARRIED AND
SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUY A CAKEFROM A BAKER, WELL THAT'S
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, EXACT SAMEPEOPLE STANDING UP FOR ONE
OR THE OTHER.
>> I THINK THE INCONSISTENCIESAND LACK OF GENUINENESS ARE WHAT
BOTHER REPUBLICANS --
WHY CONGRESS HAS ABOUT A 10%APPROVAL RATING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLYRIGHT, PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT THINGS
THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHAT THEISSUE IS AND NOT WITH THEIR
PERSONAL BIAS INTO IT.
>> Jon: OR MAKE AN ARGUMENT,YOU KNOW, THIS RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY ARGUMENT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE WORKED BACKWARDS FROM
WE ARE AGAINST THE COURTSGRANTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY, ANDWE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET OUT OF THAT.
MAYBE WE'LL TRY THE STATESRIGHTS ARGUMENT.
OKAY, THAT DIDN'T WORK.
NOW LET'S TRY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
>> BUT THERE IS ALSO SOMETHINGWE NEED TO SEPARATE OUT.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THEY TOLD METHEY WERE GOING TO BUILD A
MOSQUE AT 9/11, I WAS HORRIFIEDAND THOUGHT IT WAS A TERRIBLE
THING, BUT AM NOT FOR A LAW TOPREVENT THEM.
IF YOU WANT TO MARCH DOWN THESTREET AND ARE PART OF THE
K.K.K., I AM HORRIFIED ANDOBJECT TO IT, BUT THERE ARE
CERTAIN-- THE FIRST AMENDMENTIS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO BE
DESPICABLE.
IT'S EASY TO ACCEPT --
>> Jon: BUT YOU CAN'T HARDLYEQUATE THE MOSQUE WITH THE
K.K.K. OR GAY MARRIAGE WITH THEK.K.K. --
I HEAR THAT ARGUMENT A LOT.
>> THE THING IS I THINK YOU CANPERSONALLY OBJECT TO THINGS THE
LAW WILL ALLOW.
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO SAYTHAT WE ACCEPT EVERYONE ELSE'S
BELIEFS ON EVERYTHING ELSE.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, I'M ABSOLUTELYFOR THE LAW ALLOWING -- NOT
PREVENTING A MOSQUE TO BE BUILT,HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, I
I THINK IT'S A REALLY REALLY BADIDEA TO BUILD A MOSQUE AT THE
9/11 SITE.
>> Jon: YOU DO KNOW  THOUGH THATTHERE WAS A MOSQUE THERE
ALREADY?
>> I KNOW.
BUT IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LIKETHEY'RE TWEAKING US A LITTLE
BIT, JON.
THAT THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BITINSULTING TO THE MEMORY OF THE
3,000 PEOPLE WHO DIED.
>> Jon: THEY'RE NOT BUILDINGIT ON THE SITE.
WE'RE GETTING LOST IN THE WEEDSHERE.
LET ME GET BACK TO WHATI'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
>> Jon: WE WERE TALKING ABOUTTHAT IDEA THAT LIBERTY REALLY IS
FUNGIBLE WHEN THEY'RE TALKINGABOUT WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE.
I'M FASCINATED BY THE IDEA OFRELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN THIS
COUNTRY BECAUSE THE DEPTH OFFEELING SEEMS REAL.
CHRISTIANS TRULY FEEL PERSECUTEDOR A FEELING WITHIN THAT
COMMUNITY THAT THEY ARE BEINGPERSECUTED, AND I CAN'T FOR THE
LIFE OF ME FIND WHERE THAT WOULD-- YOU'RE ALLOW TO PRACTICE.
NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TO MAKESOMETHING -- IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE GOING TO A COBBLER ANDASKING BAKE ME A CAKE FOR MY GAY
WEDDING.
YOU SELL CAKE!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I DON'T GET IT!
>> I'M STILL PICTURING CAKE INTHE SHAPE OF A SHOE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'SIMPORTANT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
FREEDOM... THAT FREEDOM DOESN'TMEAN THAT WE ALL HAVE TO
AGREE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE'S --WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEY ARE,
WHAT RELIGION THEY ARE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO LIKE EVERYBODY.
>> Jon: NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TOBE HAPPY BAKING IT.
>> THE THING IS, WHERE I WOULDSEPARATE IT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
PERSONAL OPINIONS, THEY'REAFRAID -- SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THEIRPERSONAL REORIGINALS OPINIONS
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED EVENIN THEIR CHURCH. AND THERE ARE
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE BECAUSEWHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS OKAY, YOU
GIVE A DEDUCTION TO YOUR CHURCH,SO WHO'S MONEY IS THAT?
IS THAT NOT THE GOVERNMENT'SMONEY AND THEY CAN REGULATE THE
CHURCH BECAUSE IT'S A DEDUCTION.
PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THIS.
THEY'RE ARGUING AND SAYING THATBECAUSE I GET A DEDUCTION WHEN I
GIVE MY MONEY TO THE CHURCH THATSOMEHOW IT WASN'T MIGHT HAVE
MONEY, WAS A GOVERNMENT SUBSIDYAND THEREFORE THEY CAN REGULATE
WHAT THEY SAY IN THE CHURCH.
I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCEBETWEEN ACCEPTANCE AND
NEUTRALITY OF THE LAW AND TRYINGTO FORCE YOUR OPINION ON
PEOPLE EVEN IN THEIR CHURCH, OREVEN IN THEIR EXPRESSION.
>> Jon: NOBODY'S FORCING IT ONTHE CHURCH.
AND SAME WAY WITH REPRODUCTIVERIGHTS.
YOU FALL ON THE LIBERTARIAN SIDEOF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT
YOUR VIEWS ON THAT ARE NOTPERSONAL FREEDOM ORIENTED.
THEY'RE MUCH MORE THE STATESHOULD MANDATE WHAT A WOMAN
SHOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION.
>> I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLICATEDTHAN THAT BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE,
I'M AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST AND IEXAMINE BABIES THAT ARE
SOMETIMES ONE POUND.
AND I EXAMINE FOR A DISEASERETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'TLOSE THEIR VISION FROM BEING
BORN TOO EARLY.
>> Jon: WHILE YOU'RE IN THESENATE?
>> SOMETIMES.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU BATMAN?
YOU'RE IN THE SENATE AND THENYOU'RE GOING AROUND CHECKING
BABIES' EYES?
(LAUGHTER)
>> HERE'S THE THING, EVERYONESAYS THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION
TO PROTECT THE BABY, EVEN IF THEPARENTS SHAKE THE BABY, DON'T
FEED THE BABY, THEY GO TO JAILBECAUSE THE STATE HAS A ROLE.
THE QUESTION WE HAVE IS WHENDOES THE STATE HAVE A ROLE WITH
THE BABY?
AND THE HARD QUESTION, AND IDON'T THINK IT'S AS EASY A
QUESTION AS PEOPLE SAY.
>> Jon: IT'S NOT AN EASYQUESTION.
>> IF THE BABY'S SEVEN POUNDSAND ONE WEEK FROM BEING BORN,
DOES THAT BABY HAVE NO RIGHTS ORDOES THAT BABY RIGHTS?
>> Jon: WELL, NO, I THINK WEMAKE THE JUDGMENT -- WE ALREADY
DO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT AND WE TRYTO GET IT WITHIN -- BUT THERE'S
APPARENTLY A WINDOW WHERE --
>> WELL, THE WAY IT WORKS NOWUNDER THE CURRENT LAW IN THE
THIRD TRIMESTER, IF THE WOMANHAS A HEALTH COMPLAINT, SHE CAN
HAVE AN ABORTION IN THE THIRDTRIMESTER.
THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTIONBECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A
FAIRLY LARGE BABY IN THE THIRDTRIMESTER.
>> Jon: BUT THAT'S A MOREUNUSUAL CASE THAN WHAT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT, LIKE IN THEFIRST 12 WEEKS.
A WOMAN'S BEEN RAPED, FIRST 12WEEKS.
AND PREGNANCY IS NOT A ZERO-SUMGAME.
AND A WOMAN'S LIFE, PEOPLE DIEGIVING BIRTH.
>> SO THE DEBATE BECOMES ONEWHERE WE'RE REALLY POLARIZED.
THOSE WHO ARE PRO-CHOICE WANT TOTALK ABOUT THE FIRST SIX WEEKS
WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE ANDKNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-LIFESAY, WELL THEN YOU EXPLAIN TO
ME THE 7-POUND BABY BIGGER THANTHE 1 POUND BABY THAT HAS
ALL ITS RIGHTS.
SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS EASY.
I THINK IT'S A DECISION ABOUTPEOPLE DECIDING WHEN LIFE
BEGINS, AND LIFE IS SORT OF ACONTINUUM IN THAT GESTATION
AGE.
AND IT'S LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, I'MPRO-LIFE, BUT I'M FOR PLAN B.
SO IN THE VERY EALY STAGES,TAKING BIRTH CONTROL TO TRY TO
PREVENT A PREGNANCY FROMOCCURING, I'M ALL FOR THAT, BUT
IT'S TH REALLY REALLY EARLYSTAGE, AND IT'S EASIER FOR
PEOPLE TO GET THEIR MIND AROUNDIT, NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE ON
THE PRO-LIFE/ PRO-CHOICESPECTRUM.
BUT I THINK WE MAKE IT TOO EASYAND WE'RE NOT THINKING THROUGH
THIS AS MUCH AS WE COULD.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT MOSTPEOPLE BELIEVE THE ABORTION
DEBATE IS A RELATIVELY COMPLEXONE AND ONE THAT IS VERY
PASSIONATE. BUT --
>> WE PUT PEOPLE IN BOXES.
YOU'RE EITHER IN THIS BOX ORTHAT BOX.
I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE MAKE ITTOO EASY AND WE'RE TOO FLIPPANT
WITHOUT SAYING IS THERE ANYTHINGSPECIAL ABOUT LIFE?
IF YOU BELIEVE THERE ISSOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT HUMANS,
IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUTLIFE ANYTIME OR JUST LIKE, YEAH,
WE CAN DISCARD THAT.
>> Jon: WELL, THE ONLY THING IWOULD SAY ABOUT THAT IS THAT
PROJOURTIVE TO PEOPLE WHOBELIEVE IN WOMEN'S CHOICE TO
SUGGEST THEY DON'T THINK THERE'SANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT LIFE BUT
THAT'S FOR A DIFFERENT TIME.
(APPLAUSE)
>> IS THAT APPLAUSE SIGN --
>> Jon: IT'S MY SHOW.
>> I NEED AN APPLAUSE SIGN WHENI SAY SOMETHING.
WHERE'S SOMETHING WHEN I SAYSOMETHING?
>> Jon: SAY SOMETHINGAPPLAUSE-WORTHY AND I THINK
YOU'D GET IT.
>> OH, MAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: BUT IT IS INTERESTINGBECAUSE EVEN -- YOU KNOW, YOU
STAND SOMEWHAT NOT ALONE IN YOURPARTY BUT EVEN THERE WHEN
RELIGION ENTERS INTO THEQUESTION, IT CLOUDS THE IDEA
THAT -- BECAUSE YOU PORTRAY ITAS, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO
FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO AGREEWITH YOUR BELIEFS, BUT WE'RE
NOT.
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO THETHING THAT THEY DO FOR THEIR
BUSINESS.
WHAT IS A CHRIS CHAIN BUSINESS?
AND I DON'T MEAN THATDISRESPECTFULLY.
>> BUT I GUESS THE THING ISLET'S SEE YOU DO HAVE SOMEONE
AND THIS CASE HAS BEEN RULED ONON SORT OF MAKING T-SHIRTS.
YOU HAVE A CHRISTIAN BUSINESS, ITHINK THIS WAS IN LEXINGTON,
KENTUCKY, IN MY STATE, THEYCHOSE NOT TO MAKE SHIRTS THAT
WERE PRO-CHOICE, THEY CHOSE NOTTO MAKE SHIRTS THAT WERE
DEMOCRAT -- BECAUSE THAT'S NOTCHRISTIAN, OF COURSE --
>> Jon: SURE!
THAT'S SATAN!
SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE DEVIL!
WHOO!
>> NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
BUT, NO, THEN THEY CHOSE TONOT MAKE T-SHIRTS SUPPORTING GAY
MARRIAGE.
THE THING IS THAT DOES SOUND TOME LIKE A FREEDOM ISSUE WHERE
YOU CAN GO DOWN THE STREET ANDGET SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE IT.
AND I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO ISINTOLERANT.
I'M SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES INLETTING PEOPOLE LIVE LIFE THE
WAY THEY WANT TO LIVE IT, BUT IALSO WOULD INCLUDE CHRISTIANS IN
THAT, TOO, WHO HAVE A BELIEFTHAT IS DIFFERENT THAN MANY --
>> Jon: WE HAVE THIS IDEACORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE AND
SHOULD IT BE AS EASY AS I DON'TAGREE WITH THIS AND IT'S BECAUSE
I'M CHRISTIAN, BECAUSE THEN,WELL, I MEAN, SEEMS LIKE GAY
MARRIAGE LOOMS A LOT LARGER INTHE MINDS OF CERTAIN
CONSERVATIVES THAN IT DOES INTHE BIBLE AND THE ONLY THING I
WOULD SAY IS, DON'T THEY SELLCAKES TO SINNERS ALL THE TIME?
ADULTERERS, PEOPLE THAT USE--WHEN YOU COME IN, DO YOU GO,
I'D LIKE A CAKE.
AND THEY GO, DO YOU USE THE NAMEOF THE LORD IN VAIN?
(APPLAUSE)
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT OUT? ITFEELS DISINGENUOUS.
>> HERE'S THE THING, JON.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WAYYOU TIED THIS ALL TOGETHER
BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT US FULLCIRCLE.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'SWHAT I DO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUTWHETHER CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE QUESTIONOF THE PATRIOT ACT BECAUSE WHAT
HAVE BEEN FILIBUSTERING ABOUT IS--
(LAUGHTER)
-- WHETHER OR NOT A WARRANT THATHAS A CORPORATION'S NAME ON IT,
VERIZON, CAN COLLECT ALL THERECORDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE --
WHETHER A CORPORATION'S APERSON.
>> Jon: THAT'S MY POINT.
>> SO WE'RE RIGHT BACK TO THEPATRIOT ACT AND I THINK WE AGREE
NOW.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THIS IS GOING TO KEEP MEAWAKE TONIGHT, ISN'T IT?
I'M GOING TO BE SIGNATURE AROUNDGOING, WAIT A MINUTE!
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.
GOOD LUCK.
THE OTHER PEOPLE RUNNINGAGAINST, MANY OF THEM ARE CRAZY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT? IS THATGOING ALRIGHT?
>> CRAZY IS IN THE EYE OF THEBEHOLDER, JON.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S JUST SAY --
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S JUST SAY NOT PERFECTLYSANE ALL THE TIME.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU WITH ALLTHIS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: I WISH YOU WELL.
TAKING A STAND, IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
SENATOR RAND PAUL, EVERYBODY!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
