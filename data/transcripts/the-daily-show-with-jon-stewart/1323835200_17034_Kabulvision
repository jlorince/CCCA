>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT... I THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THE
CONVERSATION.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY
THE CONVERSATION.
LAWRENCE LESSIG LAW LEVIATHAN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TONIGHT WE BEGIN WITH A... LIKE
MOST AMERICANS, TELEVISION, I
ENJOY IT.
WHETHER IT'S MAD MEN, "BOARD
WALK EMPIRE" OR OUR COMEDY
CENTRAL BREAKOUT HIT "HEY, FART
IN THIS."
(LAUGHTER)
LOVE THOSE GUYS!
IN ADDITION TO BEING ENTERTAINED
THERE ARE FUN EDUCATIONAL
PROGRAMS ON THE TELLLY... FOR
THE U.K.
(LAUGHTER)
THERE'S AN ENTIRE CHANNEL
DEVOTED TO LEARNING CALLED THE
LEARNING CHANNEL.
(LAUGHTER)
IT TEACHES ONE WHAT IT MIGHT BE
LIKE TO HAVE EIGHT CHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
OR 17 CHILDREN.
(LAUGHTER)
OR 19 CHILDREN.
OR JUST ONE HEAVILY MADE UP
CHILDREN.
>> MY NAME'S LORI, MY SON
BRAXTON AND MY DAUGHTER ALASKA
ARE PAGEANT ROYALTY.
>> YOU'RE NOT A STRIPPER BUT
SHAKE YOUR BUTT A LITTLE BIT.
>> NOW WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY
THAT?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BECAUSE, BECAUSE,
HONEY, SHE'S A TERRIBLE MOTHER.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SOMETIMES THE LEARNING
CHANNEL SPLITS UP AND CREATES
PROGRAMMING THAT NOT ONLY IS
EDUCATIONAL BUT IS DOWN RIGHT
OFFENSIVE.
>> A REALITY SHOW ABOUT AMERICAN
MUSLIMS IS SPARKING CONTROVERSY.
AND EVEN CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT
TODAY.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE THEY
THINKING?
WHO GIVES A JIHADI TERRORIST A
SHOW-- I SAY, ASSUMING THAT THAT
MUST BE IT.
BECAUSE THERE'S A CONTROVERSY.
THIS ALL-AMERICAN MUSLIM SHOW
MUST BE ABOUT JIHADI PROPAGANDA.
>> ARE YOU SCARED?
>> SCARED ABOUT DELIVERING?
I'M SCARED ABOUT BEING A MOM.
>> I GOT A LOT OF MY MIND WORRY
ABOUT THE WHOLE PREGNANCY.
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING THROUGH
ALL THE PHYSICAL, THE MENTAL, I
FEEL LIKE I'M GOING THROUGH A
LOT OF IT.
(LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY?
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
INTERESTING TO HEAR EVEN IF THAT
GUY WAS BUILDING A BOMB AS HE
WAS TALKING!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS THE MOST BORING REALITY
SHOW IMAGINABLE.
IT SEEMS TO JUST SHOW MUSLIMS
LIVING THEIR LIVES.
LIKE THE REST OF US (BLEEP)ING
IDIOTS.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHY DID THE GROUP THAT
COMPLAINED, THE FLORIDA FAMILY
ASSOCIATION ORFFA, WHY DID THEY
HAVE A PROBLEM?
>> WHAT SCENES IN THE SHOW TO
QUOTE YOU ADVANCE ISLAMIC
FUNDAMENTALISM.
WHAT SCENES DO YOU HAVE A
SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH?
>> IT'S THE ABSENCE OF THE
RADICAL SIDE OF THE IMAMS
PROPOSITION OF SHARIA LAW THAT
IS MOST CONCERNING.
IT'S THE ABSENCE OF THE
APPLICATION OF ISLAM I CAN
COATS.
>> Jon: THE PROBLEM WITH THE
SHOW IS THE ABSENCE OF
RADICALISM?
THE PROBLEM IS THE TELEVISING OF
MUSLIMS WITHOUT THE TERRORIST
ELEMENT?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT THAT.
LIKE WHEN "TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL"
WAS FORCED TO INTRODUCE THE
ABORTION CLINIC BOMBER
CHARACTER.
(LAUGHTER)
ALTHOUGHLY SAY THIS, I THOUGHT
IT WAS JERRY VAN DYKE'S DARKEST
MOST INTRIGUING ROLE.
(LAUGHTER)
WHY WOULD YOU BE UPSET TO LEARN
THAT THERE ARE NON-JIHADI
MUSLIMS?
>> THIS PROGRAM CREATES AN IMAGE
THAT'S HARMFUL EDUCATION WISE TO
THE BELIEF STRUCTURE AND
MEMORIES OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS WHO WILL LOOK AT THIS
AND SAY "WELL, ALL MUSLIMS ARE
LIKE THAT" WHEN IT'S NOT
ACCURATE.
>> Jon: THIS SHOW IS HARMFUL
EDUCATION WISE TO YOUR BELIEF
STRUCTURE.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THAT NOT THE PURPOSE OF
EDUCATION?
VIS-A-VIS BELIEF STRUCTURES?
(LAUGHTER)
TO REPLACE YOUR BELIEF STRUCTURE
WITH FACTS?
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I DON'T LIKE THE... I DON'T LIKE
THE SHOW "NOVA" BECAUSE IT IS
HARMFUL TO MY BELIEF STRUCTURE
THAT THE OCEAN TIDES ARE
CONTROLLED BY MONSTERS.
(LAUGHTER)
THE BALLS ON THIS GUY.
THIS SHOW CHALLENGES THE
STEREOTYPE I HAVE ABOUT MUSLIMS.
SO I GUESS I COULD NO LONGER
ACCEPT THAT STIR OWE TYPE OR, IF
IT PLEASE IT IS COURT, YOU COULD
JUST REPLACE THESE MUSLIMS WITH
ONES THAT MORE APTLY FIT MY
NARROW VIEW.
I'M ALSO TROUBLED WHY NO ONE ON
YOUR SHOW "LITTLE PEOPLE BIG
WORLD" WHISTLES WHILE THEY WORK.
OR MAKES CANDY FOR WILLY WONKA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SINCERELY, YOUR FRIENDS AT
