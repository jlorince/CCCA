(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE EDITOR AT LARGE
FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE AND THE HOST OF CNN'S "FAREED ZAKARIA G.P.S."
HIS BOOK IS NOW OUT IN PAPER BACK.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM FAREED ZAKARIA!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THE POST-AMERICAN WORLD IS NOW OUT IN PAPER BACK.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE THE E-BOOK OF IT.
A WONDERFUL READ ON AN, BOOK MACHINE.
(LAUGHTER) DO YOU HAVE AN E-BOOK MACHINE?
>> I DO HAVE AN E-BOOK MASHINE.
I GET ROYALTIES EITHER WAY SO I'M DELIGHTED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
EVEN IF... BECAUSE IF IT'S ON AN E-BOOK MACHINE I ASSUME IT WAS JUST FREE.
LIKE E-BOOKS DIDN'T COUNT.
>> NO, NO, IT JUST THE MONEY.
THE CONTENT PRODUCER AS WE ARE CALLED, WE STILL DO ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ME IN THAT CATEGORY.
(LAUGHTER) DID YOU WRITE THIS BY YOURSELF?
WERE THERE NO...
>> WELL, YOU KNOW....
>> Jon: OKAY, THEN.
>> COUPLE GUEST WRITERS.
RESEARCH ASSISTANTS.
>> Jon: WERE YOU LAYING OUT ANY FORE SKINS FOR ANYBODY ELSE?
LITTLE BUCKETS HERE AND THERE?
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS STUFF.
I READ YOUR ARTICLE ABOUT SYRIA.
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT...
>> JON, NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I SHOWED A GREAT INSENSITIVITY AND I APOLOGIZE,
WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
WHAT ABOUT BANNING COSTUMES?
(LAUGHTER) THE SERIOUS SITUATION... SO EVERYTHING THAT I'M HEARING IS RUSSIA.
RUSSIA'S THE BIG STUMBLING BLOCK HERE.
IF RUSSIA WOULD JUST GET OUT OF THE WAY THE WORLD CAVALRY COULD CHARGE IN AND BRING ORDER WHERE
CHAOS EXISTS.
YOU WRITE IT'S NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
>> WELL, RUSSIA IN A SENSE WE'RE BLAMING FOR FACT THAT WE DON'T A GOOD ANSWER.
BECAUSE IMAGINE THAT RUSSIA WERE TO DO EVERYTHING WE'RE SAYING AND SAY, OKAY, FINE, SIGN ON TO
THE SKOUB SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION.
THEN WHAT?
ARE WE GOING TO ACTUALLY SEND TROOPS IN?
THIS IS A PRETTY DIFFICULT SITUATION.
SYRIA IS, I THINK... LIBYA WAS TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF SYRIA WITH ONE-THIRD THE POPULATION WHICH
MEANT THE REBELS HAD LOTS OF SPACES TO HIDE.
THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE OVER A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY.
THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE OVER BENGHAZI, THEN YOU CAN REPLY THEM.
IN SYRIA YOU HAVE THIS VERY SMALL COUNTRY, LOTS OF PEOPLE AND A VERY STRONG ARMY.
NOTICE THE SYRIAN REBELS, MY HEART GOES OUT TO THEM OBVIOUSLY BUT THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
HOLD A CITY FOR MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO.
THERE'S NOT A PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT THEY ACTUALLY HOLD AS A BASE FROM WHICH THEY COULD
BE RESUPPLIED OR SOMETHING.
SO THIS WAS... THIS WOULD INVOLVE VERY SIGNIFICANT MILITARY FORCE AND THE QUESTION
IS ARE WE REALLY UP FOR THAT THAT?
ARE WE UP FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN WHAT IS POSSIBLY A VERY MESSY CONFLICT FOR A WHILE AND IF WE
ARE, FRANKLY, IT'S NOT THE RUSSIANS THAT ARE STOPPING US,
IT'S OUR OWN INHIBITIONS.
>> Jon: SHOULD WE BE UP FOR IT?
THIS DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL...
IT ALREADY SUZUKI S A GREAT HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND A TRAGEDY BUT WE COULD BE TALKING
ABOUT SLAUGHTER FOR YEARS IN A REAL...
>> I WOULD BE... I'D LIKE TO SEE US PUSH OTHER WAYS AND I'D LIKE
TO SEE US TIGHTEN THE NOOSE AROUND ASSAD'S NECK IN OTHER WAYS, SANCTIONS, THINGS LIKE THAT.
THE MILITARY OPTION IS NOT AN ATTRACTIVE ONE.
IT'S NOT CLEAR WE COULD SUCCEED WITHOUT AN ENORMOUS MILITARY INTERVENTION.
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN SYRIA HONESTLY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SYRIA IS 40%....
>> Dave: BUT WHEN WE DO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN A PLACE TO INVADE IT?
(LAUGHTER) THAT SEEMS NEW TO ME.
THAT'S ALWAYS THE ANSWER.
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE, THERE'S NOT THE CERTAIN TICHLT AS THOUGH
THERE'S EVER CERTAINTY.
>> WE COULD DO WHAT WE DID IN IRAQ.
>> Jon: WELL, I'M NOT...
>> FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS LATER.
40% OF SYRIA IS MINORITIES.
KURDS, ALAWITES, CHRISTIANS.
AND THEY SO FAR HAVE NOT... IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THEY HAVE JOINED THE OPPOSITION.
SO IF WE....
>> Jon: WHO IS THE OPPOSITION?
>> BASICALLY RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS TO BE A SUNNI VERSUS ALAWITE AND IF YOU GET INVOLVED
IN THAT... YOU'RE GETTING INTO A VERY....
>> Jon: THAT'S MUCH LARGER SECTARIAN...
>> AND THEN YOU COULD END UP IN A SITUATION LIKE IRAQ WHERE WHEN ONE SIDE ENDS THE OTHER SIDE
GETS SCREWED AND THEN THAT PRODUCES ITS OWN DYNAMIC WHICH WAS THE INSURGENCY IN IRAQ SO
IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO ME THAT WE COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE EFFECTIVELY WHICH IS WHAT YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IN A MILITARY OPERATION.
>> Jon: CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR FIVE MINUTES?
WHAT I WANT TO GET INTO AFTER THIS, THAT BEING SAID-- AND THIS SPEAKS TO PROPAGANDA-- ALL I'VE
BEEN READING ABOUT IS RUSSIA SENDING ATTACK HELICOPTERS TO SYRIA SO IT MADE IT SEEM AS
THOUGH THEY WERE FAR MORE INVOLVED IN THIS THAN THEY ARE.
IS IT VIEW?
>> ANSWER RIGHT AFTER THIS.
ARE WE MEANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NO, NO, WE'LL ANSWER RIGHT AFTER THIS.
BUT THAT WAS AWESOME THE WAY YOU DID AFTER THAT!
FAREED ZAKARIA G.P.S. ON CNN.
WE'LL GO TO THE WEB WITH THE ANSWER.
