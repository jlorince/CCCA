WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
THE GREAT AND RECENT GOLDENGLOBE-WINNING JULIANNE MOORE
IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. THEFILM "STILL ALICE."
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM"STILL ALICE," IT WILL WRECK --
IT IS, MAN, IT IS A GOOD FILM,AND SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.
FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUTTHE SHOW, THE DAILY SHOW.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THENEWS.
THROUGH A COMEDIC LENSE.
(LAUGHTER)
OH MY GOD, DID I JUST GIVE AWAYTHE PREMISE.
I WANT TO SAY, DESPITE LASTWEEK'S SENSELESS ATTACK ON
THE FRENCH SATIRICALMAGAZINE CHARLIE HEBDO A
NEW EDITION OF THE MAGAZINEWAS RELEASED TODAY.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> CHARLIE HEADBO IS BACKON NEWSSTANDS THIS MORNING.
>> MORE THAN THREE MILLIONCOPIES OF CHARLIE HEBDO
SOLD OUT WITHIN HOURS.
>> Jon: WOW.
THREE MILLION -- THAT ISAMAZING.
BUT I WANT TO SAY, I REALLYHOPE THIS ISN'T THE SECRET
TO IT SAVING THE PUBLISHINGINDUSTRY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S GOING TO WORK A FEWTIMES, BUT THAT IS NOT A
SUSTAINABLE MODEL FOR AMAGAZINE.
OF COURSE HIGH SALES WEREN'T THEONLY WAY FRANCE SHOWED
SHOWED ITS LIDARITY.
WE ALL REMEMBER SUNDAY'SINSPIRATIONAL MARCH THROUGH
PARIS.
MILLIONS STANDING AGAINSTTERRORISM AND FOR FREE
SPEECH, EVERYONE WAS THERE.
WELL, NOT EVERYONE.
A LOT OF-- A LOT OF PEOPLEWERE THERE.
HE WASN'T THERE BUT OBAMACOULD HAVE FELT INTIMIDATED
AS THEY MARCHED WITH THELOCKED ARMS, IT GIVES OFF
KIND OF A MEAN GIRL'S VIBE,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THAT CAN UPSET PEOPLE.
WE REALLY DID JUST PUT THEIRHEADS ON IT, HUH?
JUST DIDN'T -- ALRIGHT.
STILL IT WAS A GLOBAL MOMENT.
THE MARCHERS, THE SYMBOLICPENCILS, THEY CARRIED THE
HASHTAG JE SUIS CHARLIE.
IT TRENDED ON SOCIAL MEDIAALL OVER THE WORLD.
THEY CLAIMED IN A FREESOCIETY, EXPRESSION WITHOUT
FEAR OF PERSECUTION IS ABASIC RIGHT.
AND THAT BY THE WAY COMESALL THE WAY FROM LE TOP.
>> TODAY THE FRENCH REPUBLICAS A WHOLE WAS TARGET.
THE REPUBLIC MEANS FREEDOMOF EXPRESSION.
IT MEANS CULTURE, CREATION,PLURALISM AND DEMOCRACY.
>> Jon: C'EST MAGNIFIQUE!
THE FRENCH POSITION ON FREESPEECH IS THE SAME AS THEIR
POSITION ON MISTRESSES,THERE CAN BE NO LIMITS!
THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH ISABSOLUMONE.
>> THE ANTI-SEMITIC COMEDIANDIEUDONNE ARRESTED FOR
INSIGHTMENT AFTER HIS FACEBOOKPOST THAT SUPPORTED ATTACKERS.
>> HE TWEETED JE SUIS CHARLIECOULIBALY, WHICH IS THE
NAME OF THE ONE OF ATTACKERS.
>> MAN-- I WAS GONNA SAY [BLEEP]THAT I GUY, BUT WE WERE ALL
THERE STREETS WITH THE PENCILSAND THE FREE SPEECH.
BRAIN HURTS!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALLRIGHT.
DON'T GET PEA WRONG.
THAT IS A DISPICIBLE FACEBOOKPOST THAT THAT GUY DID, BUT --
ISN'T THAT WHAT THE UNFRIENDBUTTON IS FOR?
YOU JUST CLICK THE UNFRIENDBUTTON AND THEN-- NO, FRANCE,
YOU DON'T JUST HIDE THEMFROM YOUR TIMELINE.
THAT'S THE COWARDS WAY.
OH, MAN.
THIS SUCKS.
JE SUIS CONFUSED.
ARRESTING SOMEONE FOR SAYINGSOMETHING DAYS AFTER A RALLY
SUPPORTING THE RIGHT OF FREEEXPRESSION, IT'S A LITTLE
WEIRD.
MAYBE IF WE NAW PORE ABOUTTHE CULPRIT.
>> DIEUDONNE IS VERYCONTROVERSIAL. HE HAD A TOUR
CANCELLED LAST YEAR BECAUSE OFTHIS ANTI-SEMITIC ROUTINE THAT
HE DOES.
>> Jon: SO FRENCH AUTHORITIESHAD TO CANCEL HIS TOUR BECAUSE
HE DOES AN ANTI-SEMITICROUTINE. I SEE.
SHOULDN'T THAT TOUR HAVEBEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE NO
ONE WAS BUYING TICKETS?
(LAUGHTER)
FOR THE ANTI-SEMITIC COMEDYSHOW?
WHY-- SHOULDN'T THAT BEEN AMARKETPLACE SITUATION.
SHOULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN THEPHONE CALL: "HEY,DIEUDIONNE.
IT'S ME, YOUR AGENT.
MORTY BERNSTEIN" -- I'M SURETHAT IT'S -- I DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR A FACT --
>> YEAH, YEAH, I'M SORRYYOUR TOUR HAS BEEN CANCELLED.
YEAH, I KNOW, I THOUGHT ITWAS FUNNY TOO T IT'S JUST
THAT ALL THAT RACISTANTI-SEMITIC [BLEEP] YOU DO,
IT TURNS IT OUT PEOPLE THINKTHAT SUCKS."
I'M BEGINNING TO THINKCOMEDY ISN'T FRANCE'S THING.
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.
FRANCE, YOU STILL GOT PAINTINGAND KISSING AND FOOD THAT IS
HARD ON THE OUTSIDE BUT SOFTON THE INSIDE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT.YOU'RE THE BEST AT IT.
STICK TO YOUR BRIES, YOURBAGUETTES, YOUR BRULEE CREME.
JUST STAY AWAY FROM COMEDY.
THAT IS OUR THING.
YOU KNOW, EVEN YOUR FAVORITECOMEDY GUY IS STILL OUR GUY.
AND THE THRUTH IS, WE DON'TEVEN GET HIM.
FRANCE, I FEEL YOUR AU BON PAIN.
I-- WE HAVE SIMILAR SPEECHRELATED STRUGGLES HEAR IN
AMERICA.
GENERALLY ON THE SIDEOF THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWING
[BLEEP] TO PEOPLE TO [BLEEP]THE THING.
AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T SEETHEIR BOOBS.
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO DRAW ALINE SOMEWHERE.
TURNS OUT THE LINE INAMERICA IS RIGHT ABOVE THE
NIPPLE.
GENERALLY, WE EXPRESS OURPOLITICAL OUTRAGE AT
OBJECTIONAL IDEAS NOT TOTHROUGH ARREST, CERTAINLY
NOT THROUGH MURDER, BUTTHROUGH THE PURCHASING OR
NONPURCHASING OF CERTAINLITMUS TEST SANDWICHES.
CHICK-FIL-A.
THAT'S HOW A CIVILIZEDPEOPLE -- I'M IN THE SAYING
YOU SHOULD COMPANY'S OURMODEL.
GOD KNOWS YOU WILL HAVEDIABETES IN A WEEK.
CLEARLY IT'S DIFFICULT FORANY COUNTRY TO RECONCILE THE
IDEA OF ABSOLUTE DEFENSE OFFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WITH
ARRESTING PEOPLE FOR THEIRALBEIT INDEFENSIBLE FACEBOOK
POSTS AND SPEECH.
IT'S WHY I FELT THAT ITWOULD BE BEST EXPRESSED
THROUGH THE ART OF FILM. CINEMA,AS YOU WOULD REFER TO IT.
PLEASE ENJOY, WELL, ENJOY ISPROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT WORD.
(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE SIT THROUGH MY LATESTENGLISH LANGUAGE FRENCH FILM
ENTITLED LA CRAYON ANGOISSE.
>> WHAT IS MY PURPOSE!
IF I EXIST MARELY TO WRITETHE OPINIONS OF THOSE I
AGREE WITH, IS EXISTENCEITSELF JUST A LIE?
>> MAKE LOVE TO ME.
SUBSUME YOUR HYPOCRISY, IN THEECSTASY OF ORGASM.
>> BUT IS NOT LOVE ITSELFSPEECH?
WHEN SPEECH IS RESTRICTED, ISLOVE THEN NOT VIOLENCE AGAINST
THE STATE.
>> IF YOU DON'T [BLEEP] JUSTSAY YOU DON'T WANT TO
[BLEEP].
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
IF YOU DON'T WANT [BLEEP]I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
>> I THINK ALL FOREIGNERSSHOULD BE DEPORTED SO THAT
THE FRENCH BLOOD LINE STAYSPURE.
SHUT UP, LE PEN.
SHUT UP, LE PEN.
>> YOU SEE, THERE IS -- LEPEN IS WHAT THE PHYSICALLY,
BUT ALSO IS THE NAME OF A FRENCHRIGHT WING POLITICIAN KNOWN
KNOWN FOR EXTREME VIEWS ONIMMIGRANTS --
>> WHAT A WITTY REFERENCE, WHATA DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
YOU ARE HILARIOUS.
I CANNOT BEAR THE DISSONANCEBETWEEN SPEECH AND TRUTH.
>> NEITHER CAN I.
>> LET'S HAVE A MENAGE A TROISAND DROWN OURSELVES IN LE SIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
