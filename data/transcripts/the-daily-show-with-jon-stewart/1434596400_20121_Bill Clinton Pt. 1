(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MY FIRST QUESTION IS AN OBVIOUSONE. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN A
HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER FORPRESIDENT FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
DOES DONALD TRUMP'SENTRY INTO THE RACE IN ANY WAY
COMPLICATE THAT OR CHANGETHE WAY THAT YOU'RE VIEWING
YOUR VOTE?
TAKE YOUR TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A HARDQUESTION BUT--
(LAUGHTER)
I WANT TO JUST REMIND YOUTHAT AS YOU POINTED OUT,
WITH THAT UNBELIEVABLEOPENING, YOU GOT FIVE WEEKS
TO GO, AND I'M STILL THESPOUSE OF A PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE.
(LAUGHTER)
SO UNLIKE YOU--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
UNLIKE YOU, I HAVE TO TAKE A BOWNOW AND THEN.  ACTUALLY, IT
WAS VINTAGE TRUMP.
HE HAS BEEN BELIEVE IT OR NOTUNCOMMENTLY NICE TO HILLARY
AND ME, HE THOUGHT HILLARY WASA GOOD SENATOR FOR NEW YORK
AFTER 9/11 AND IS ONE OF THEMANY REPUBLICANS WHO
SUPPORTED OUR FOUNDATIONBEFORE THEY GOT THE MEMO.
(LAUGHTER)
AND SO-- SO--
>> Jon: BUT DON'T YOU THINK HEIS LESS OF A REPUBLICAN AND
MORE OF A TRUMPICRAT.
HE REALLY LIKE I DON'T THINKHE CARES AS LONGS HE CAN PUT
HIS NAME ON THE WHITE HOUSE.
I DON'T THINK HE CARES.
GIVE IT A NICE GOLD PAVING,YOU KNOW, CLASS IT UP.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WELL, BENEATH ALL THERHETORIC, INCLUDING THE STUFF
THAT YOU MENTIONED WE ALLDISAGREE WITH, LIKE YOU SAID
ABOUT THE MEXICANS -- IT WAS--
>> Jon: BIZARRE.
>> WELL NOT ONLY THAT, JUSTBASICALLY-- BETWEEN 2010 AND
2014, THERE WAS NO NETMIGRATION FROM MEXICO.
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU ALL?
>> Jon: WHERE DO YOU KEEP ALLTHESE FACTS?
WHERE DO YOU PUT THEM?
>> I DON'T KNOW, PRESIDENTOBAMA HAS GOT THE CONGRESS
TO GO ALONG WITH HIS BRAINPROJECT AND I HOPE I LEARN
WHERE ALL THIS STUFF IS STORED.
>> Jon: THIS BRINGS UP ANINTERESTING POINT.
HERE IS THE DEAL, WE'RE TALKINGABOUT TRADE.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUTTRADE. SO, NAFTA HAS BEEN
VERY BENEFICIAL, I THINK FORMEXICO, I THINK YOU WOULD
AGREE.
IT BROUGHT A LOT OF JOBS TOMEXICO, IT CHANGED THE POLITICAL
CLIMATE DOWN THERE.
IT BROUGHT THEM-- NAFTA ISBEING USED AS AN EXAMPLE OF
WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO THE TPP.
SO TELL ME, WHY ARE THESETRADE AGREEMENTS, THESE
FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS GOODFOR AMERICAN WORKERS.
>> WELL, LET'S TALK, FIRSTOF ALL LET'S EXPLAIN WHAT
HAPPENED IN MEXICO.
>> Jon: OKAY.
HOW FAR BACK ARE WE GOING?
>> JUST TO NAFTA.
SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER NAFTAWAS THEY HAD A TOTAL, ALMOST A
TOTAL COLLAPSE OF THEIRCURRENCY.
I GAVE THEM A LOAN IN 1995,WHICH THEY PAID BACK THREE
YEARS EARLY AND TAXPAYERSEARNED $570 MILLION IN INTEREST.
$560 MILLION.
>> Jon: IT WAS 562. GO AHEAD.
>> THEY EARNED MONEY.
BUT AS A RESULT OF THAT,THEIR ECONOMY WAS WEAK.
THEY WERE ONE OF OUR BIGGESTOIL SUPPLIERS BEFORE WE WERE
SELF-SUFFICIENT IN OIL.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO WE DID HAVE A TRADEDEFICIT THERE.
AND THE ANALYSIS OF ALL OFOUR TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH
COUNTRIES WITH LOWER INCOMESTHAN WE HAVE SHOWS THAT ON
BALANCE, THE COUNTRIES WEHAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS WTH, WE
TEND TO HAVE BALANCE TRADEMUCH MORE THAN, LET'S SAY
WITH CHINA, WHICH WE HAVE NOTRADE AGREEMENT, WHERE WE
HAVE A HUGH MONEY GUESSDEFICIT.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
MORE WITH BILL CLINTON AFTERTHIS.
