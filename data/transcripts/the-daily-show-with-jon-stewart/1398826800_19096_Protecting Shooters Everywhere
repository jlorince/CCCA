HAS THEIR INTEREST IN MIND.
>> AS STAND YOUR GROUND LAWSPROLIFERATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND CONTROVERSIAL SELF DEFENSESHOOTINGS MAKE HEADLINES PEOPLE
ARE BEGINNING TO SPEAK UP ABOUTTHE HEARTBREAKING DAMAGES THESE
EVENTS CAUSE. BUT,WHO WILL SPEAK FOR
THE REAL VICTIMS OF SHOOTINGS,THE SHOOTERS?
>> AFTER SHOOTING IT'S TRAGICWHEN SOMEONE IS FORCED TO SPEND
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR TENS OFTHOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY THE
LEGAL BILLS TO DEAL WITH THETRIAL.

ANYONE. GOD BLESS YOU, CUCH.
AND, HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONEHELPING.
SERVICES LIKE CUCCINELLI'S AREPOPPING UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
BUT SOME PEOPLE, LIKE CAROLYNELEPHANT,
THINK THERE'S A DANGEROUSFLAW WITH THESE PLANS.
>> THE PROBLEM IS IF NOT ENOUGHPEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THE PLANS THE
RISK POOL IS GOING TO BE TOOSMALL.
YOU NEED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALSWITH LOWER RISKS SO THAT YOU CAN
BRING DOWN THE COST FOR ALLPARTICIPANTS.
>> YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE A BUNCHOF CLIENTS WITH PREEXISTING
INTENTIONS TO KILL SOMEONE?
>> YEAH, THAT WOULDCERTAINLY MAKE THINGS MORE RISKYFOR THE FIRM.
>> IN A CRUEL TWIST OF FATE KENCUCINELLI FACES THE PROBLEM AS
AS THE HEALTH CARE REFORM THATAS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HE HAD
PLEDGED TO STOP. BUTWHERE OBAMACARE
NEEDS THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY, HISPLAN NEEDS THOSE
WHO DON'T CONSTANTLY FANTASIZEABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE.
IN ORDER TO HELP, I TOOK A PAGEOUT OF THE OBAMACARE PLAYBOOK
AND WENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE.
CAN I TALK TO YOU ABOUT SHOOTINGPEOPLE?
WHEREVER THEY WERE.
BOOM, I'M AN ATTACKER.
I LIKE YOUR RESPONSE.YOU DIDN'T PULL A GUN OUT ON
ME WHICH MEANS YOU ARE LOW RISKAND I THINK YOU WOULD
BE A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR WHATWE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE.
>> I HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE.
[LAUGHTER]>> OH, MY GOD.
>> I'M A HOME INVADER.
EVERYBODY HAS TIME TO THINKABOUT THE FUTURE IN CASE THEY
SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE FUTURE.
>> GET OUT OF HERE I SAID.
PLEASE -- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
>> CAN I HELP YOU.
>> DO YOU FANTASIZE ABOUTSHOOTING PEOPLE?
>> NO, DO YOU HAVE $8 A MONTH?
>> YES.
>> I WOULD LOVE TO COME IN.
YOU RUN INTO THIS PERSON ON THESTREET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
>> FREEZE.
>> YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT.
THIS GUY? YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT.
>> NO, NOTHING. HE LOOKS NICEWHY WOULD I SHOOT HIM.
>> THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T WANTTO SHOOT SOMEONE MAKES YOU THE
PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR INSURANCEFOR SHOOTING SOMEONE.
>> I CAN'T SHOOT SOMEONE.
I DON'T HAVE A GUN.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN?
>> NO.
>> I HAD FAILED.
I HAD TO WARN CUCINELLI.
THIS IS THE EXACT SAME CHALLENGETHAT OBAMACARE IS FACING.
>> YEAH, EXCEPT WE DO OURSWITHOUT COMPELLING ANYBODY
TO DO ANYTHING. WE LIKETHE CONSTITUTION.
SO, THERE'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCEIN THE TWO THERE.
>> THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL MOVE ON TOANOTHER ISSUE LIKE PROTECTING
PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK FROM GOINGBANKRUPT?
>> I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLYMOVE ON TO PROTECTING GUN OWNERS
IN MARYLAND AND THEN NORTHCAROLINA IN ADDITION TOVIRGINIA.
>> OF COURSE, I'M SORRY, THERE'SSTILL STATES OUT THERE WHERE
PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO SHOOTOTHER PEOPLE.
>> IT'S A SITUATION WE'RE VERYCONCERNED ABOUT.
>> SO REST WELL, AMERICA.
IT'S GETTING SAFER TO SHOOTEVERY DAY.
