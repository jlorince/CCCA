AS YOU KNOW, ON OCTOBER 30th
OF THIS YEAR, 2010, WE'RE GOING
TO BE HOLDING A RALLY FOR SANITY
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
HERE TO DISCUSS IT, SENIOR
CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE.
WELCOME, LARRY.
>> THANK YOU, JON.
THANK YOU.
OH, JON, I AM SO EXCITED FOR
THIS.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE RALLIES
ARE TO MY PEOPLE'S HEARTS.
HISTORICALLY IT'S HOW WE STOOD
UP TO RACIST SYSTEM THAT TURNED
DOGS AND FIRE HOSES ON US, BUT
THROUGH COURAGE AND FAITH, WE
DEMANDED AND WON OUR BASIC HUMAN
DIGNITY.
SO WHAT'S YOUR RALLY ABOUT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SIMILAR.
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, IT WILL BE
DOGLESS, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL
JUST...
>> HAVEN'T QUITE HONED THE
MESSAGE.
THAT'S COOL, THAT'S COOL.
WHO'S COMING?
>> Jon: HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WHO
FEEL OVERSHADOWED BY EXTREMISTS
IN OUR CULTURE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WHO LIKE THIS SHOW MAYBE ALSO.
>> OKAY.
NERDS.
GOOD.
NOW, JON, ARE YOU THINKING
COMIC-CON NERD OR RENAISSANCE
FAIR NERD OR SHUT-IN
MASTURBATION NERD?
>> Jon:, NO IT'S NOT GOING TO
BE MASTURBATION CONTEST.
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT ONE
TO BREAK OUT, YOU BETTER HAVE A
CLEAR MESSAGE.
ALL RIGHT.
AND IF YOU WANT THE RALLY TO BE
SUCCESSFUL, JON, SET THE BARLOW,
LIKE MINISTER FARRAKHAN SHOWED
AT THE MILLION MAN MARCH.
>> I, HEAR YOUR NAME, PLEDGE I
WILL NEVER ENGAGE IN THE ABUSE
OF CHILDREN FOR SEXUAL
GRATIFICATION, BUT I...
>> Jon: POWERFUL.
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE, JON, A
MILLION BLACK MEN TURN AROUND IN
UNISON AND GO, WHAT DID THAT
[BLEEPED] JUST MAKE US SAY?
HERE ANOTHER THING,LY NOT BEAT A
NUN WITH A BAG OF NICKELS.
SAY IT.
>> Jon: YEAH, I MEAN
DEFINITELY WE'RE PROBABLY
EXPECTING FROM OUR CROWD A PRIOR
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE
IMMORALITY OF CHILD MOLESTATION.
>> GOOD, JON.
IT'S GOT TO BE ABOUT THE OPTICS.
THAT MEANS FLOODING THE STAGE
WITH AN ARTIFICIAL DIVERSITY.
LOOK HOW GLENN BECK DID IT AT
HIS RALLY.
THAT'S MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN
WATCH HIS SHOWS.
DO THE SAME THING WITH THE
GLARING RACIAL VOID ON THIS
PROGRAM.
>> Jon: NOW, HOLD ON.
THERE'S YOU, THERE'S WYATT.
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BLACK
PEOPLE.
RELAX, JON.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TRUE
VICTIMS OF YOUR PREJUDICE.
HOW MANY WHITE CHRISTIAN MALE
AMERICAN ARE ON YOUR SHOW?
>> Jon: JONES IS CANADIAN.
OLIVER IS BRITISH AND PASTY.
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
ACTUALLY.
THAT'S SILLY.
I HAVE NO PREJUDICE AGAINST
WHITE MALE AMERICAN CHRISTIANS.
STEVE CARELL WAS ON THE SHOW.
>> HATES YOU.
>> Jon: STEPHEN COLBERT.
>> HOLDING A RALLY AGAINST YOU.
COME ON.
ADMIT IT.
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE
WHITE MAN.
>> Jon: NO!
>> THAT'S WHO YOU HAVE TO
RECRUIT.
>> Jon: WE HAVE WHITE
CHRISTIAN MALES IN THE BUILDING,
JUST NOT ON CAMERA.
>> HERE'S WHAT TO DO, I'LL HOOK
YOU UP WITH SOME OF MY GOLF
BUDDIES.
NOW THINK ABOUT STAGECRAFT.
HERE'S GREAT STUFF ON THE WEB
WHEN I TYPED IN RALLY.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
>> I KNOW, JON, LOOK HOW
ORGANIZED THEY ARE.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
>> THE SIGNS ARE CONSISTENT.
EVERYBODY IS ON MESSAGE.
THAT GUY COULD BE SELLING THE
WORST [BLEEPED] ON EARTH.
>> Jon:, NO HE WAS.
THAT GUY WAS SELLING THE WORST
[BLEEPED] ON EARTH.
YOUR ADVICE FOR MY RALLY TO
RESTORE SANITY IS TO COPY
HITLER?
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
CALL YOU ANYWAY, JON.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: THANK YOU, LARRY.
