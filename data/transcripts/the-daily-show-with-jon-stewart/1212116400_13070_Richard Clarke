>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, WHO SAY
NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT IN
THE BOTH THE CLINTON AND
GEORGE W. BUSH
ADMINISTRATIONS, THE BEST
SELLING AUTHOR OF "AGAINST
ALL ENEMIES" HIS NEW BOOK IS
CALLED "YOUR GOVERNMENT
FAILED YOU"
BREAKING THE CYCLE OF
NATIONAL SECURITY DISASTERS.
IT IS AN UPBEAT KIND OF
THRILLER.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
SHOW RICHARD CLARKE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOUNG MAN, NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> Jon: YOUR BOOK IS CALLED
"YOUR GOVERNMENT FAILED YOU"
I ASSUME YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT THE PRESENT AND THE
ONCE YOU WORKED IN.
BUT BEFORE I WANT TO DO THAT,
THIS McCLELLAN THING ISEV
REE WHERE.
THIS SCOTT McCLELLAN BOOK,
HE WORKED IN THE
ADMINISTRATION.
HE WAS THE PRESS GUY.
HE HAS WRITTEN A TELL-ALL
THAT THEY ARE VERY ANGRY
ABOUT.
YOU WROTE A BOOK, "AGAINST
ALL ENEMIES" HAD WORKED FOR
THE ADMINISTRATION.
IT WAS CONSIDERED A
TELL-ALL.
I AM GOING TO READ YOU A
QUOTE.
WHEN YOUR BOOK CAME OUT,
THIS IS WHAT AN
ADMINISTRATION PERSON SAID
ABOUT YOU.
>> WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN IF HE
HAD ALL THESE GRAVE CONCERNS
DID HE NOT RAISE THESE
SOONER.
THIS IS ONE AND A HALF YEARS
AFTER HE LEFT THE
ADMINISTRATION, NOW ALL OF A
SUDDEN HE IS RAISING THESE
CONCERNS THAT HE CLAIMS HE
HAD.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
SOME OF THE FACTS.
ONE HE IS BRINGING THIS UP
IN THE HEAT OF A
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK AND
PRACTICALLY WANTS TO GO OUT
THERE AND PROMOTE THAT BOOK.
THAT WAS SCOTT McCLELLAN
TALKING ABOUT YOUR BOOK.
IS THIS -- WHAT ARE YOU
FEELING?
>> ARE YOU GOING THROUGH
CRAZY DEJA VU.
>> IT LIKE AN ECHO CHAMBER,
I TURNED ON THE TV THE OTHER
DAY AND THERE WERE WHITE
HOUSE PEOPLE SAYING HE IS A
DISGRUNTLED EX-EMPLOYEE.
WHERE DID YOU I HEAR THAT.
THAT HE IS OUT OF THE LOOP.
HE'S NEVER BEEN IN THE LOOP.
WHERE DID I HEAR THAT?
I THINK, I THINK THERE IS A
LITTLE BOX IN THE WHITE
HOUSE THAT SAYS IF ANYBODY,
YOU KNOW, ESCAPES FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE AND TELLS THE
TRUTH, BREAK THIS BOX AND
TAKE OUT THESE TALKING
POINTS.
AND IT IS --.
>> Jon: IT IS THE SAME
THING.
>> SAY HE IS A DISGRUNTLED
EMPLOYEE.
SAY IT IS AN ELECTION YEAR
AND HE IS TRYING TO SELL
BOOKS.
>> Jon: MY FAVORITE THING IS
THEY SAID THAT'S NOT THE
SCOTT I KNEW.
THE SCOTT WE KNEW LIED LIKE
A MOTHER [BLEEP]
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK -- BY
THE WAY, HE WILL BE ON ON
MONDAY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I WONDER IF THE
PRESIDENT WILL EVER WRITE A
BOOK, LIKE AFTER, BECAUSE SO
MANY PEOPLE -- MANY PEOPLE
HAVE WRITTEN THE BOOK THAT
ALL SAY THE SAME THING IT IS
NOT RIGHT, SAY A BOOK
OUTLOUD TO A GUY SITTING ON
A TYPEWRITER AND HIS BOOK
WILL BE LIKE EVERYBODY THAT
I WORKED WITH WAS DICKS.
I DIDN'T LIKE THEM.
HE WILL HAVE A TELL-ALL.
THEY WERE JERKS.
>> THERE IS SOME TRUTH THERE
IS A DICK CHENEY, THERE
IS --.
>> Jon: RIGHT, ALL THOSE
GUYS.
WHAT IN YOUR MIND,
EVERYTHING THAT WE HEAR IS A
REINFORCEMENT OF THE SAME
STORY.
THEY TALK ABOUT IT THAT IT
IS A CARICATURE.
ABOUT BUT THAT THEY OPERATED
AS A PERMANENT CAMPAIGN,
THAT THE POLITICAL
ATMOSPHERE OVERSHADOWED THE
POLICY ATMOSPHERE.
IS THAT WHAT IS IN PLAY AS
WELL WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT.
IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU TAKE ISSUE WITH NOW
STILL?
>> WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND
YOUR GOVERNMENT FAILED YOU
IS SAY LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST
9/11.
IT'S NOT JUST IRAQ IT IS
GLOBAL WARMING.
IT IS KATRINA.
IT IS ON AND ON.
NOTHING WORKS ANY MORE IN
NATIONAL SECURITY.
>> Jon: BUT DO YOU THINK
THAT IS THEIR POINT?
>> NO, --.
>> Jon: THESE GUYS WENT IN
SAYING GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE
ANSWER.
AND NOW CLEARLY THEY ARE
SHOWING US WELL, I GUESS IF
YOU GUYS ARE RUNNING IT,
WELL, IT'S NOT.
>> JON, IF YOU BEAT UP ON
GOVERNMENT.
IF YOU MAKE GOVERNMENT A
POLITICAL PUNCHING BAG.
IF YOU THROW OUT THE GOOD
PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT AND
BRING IN A LOT OF POLITICAL
HACKS, THEN IT IS NOT GOING
TO WORK.
WELL, THAT'S FINE IF YOU
DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT TO DO
ANYTHING.
BUT THERE ARE LITTLE THINGS
GOVERNMENT HAS TO DO.
LIKE PROTECT US.
>> Jon: EVEN SMALL
GOVERNMENT PEOPLE WOULD GIVE
THAT JOB OVER TO THE
GOVERNMENT.
>> WELL, THEY DON'T WANT
ANYBODY TO REGULATE ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT.
AND THEN LITTLE CHILDREN ARE
LICKING CHINESE-MADE TOYS
THAT HAVE LEAD PAINT.
>> Jon: IN THEIR DEFENSE,
THEY ARE DELICIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I HEAR THEY CAUSE BRAIN
DAMAGE.
>> Jon: YES.
>> LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU
DON'T REGULATE LIKE MAYBE
THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY WILL
GO A LITTLE CRAZY.
>> Jon: BUT ISN'T IT AN ODD
CONTRADICTION, THEY ABDICATE
RESPONSIBILITY WHILE
USURPING POER WITH.
IT SEEMS LIKE --
>> THEY WANT STRANGE -- THEY
WANT TO BE THE GOVERNMENT SO
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DO
ANYTHING.
AND THAT'S REALLY -- THEY
BELIEVE THIS --.
>> Jon: THEY BELIEVE THIS IS
WILLFUL.
I KNOW THEY REPLACED ALL THE
INSPECTOR GENERALS.
THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR FIRST
MOVES.
>> THEY APPOINTED PEOPLE TO
ALL THESE REGULATORY
AGENCIES THAT WERE SUPPOSED
TO REGULATE THINGS TO
PROTECT US.
PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO
REGULATE AND PEOPLE WHO
AREN'T REGULATING.
>> Stephen: .
>> Jon: ISN'T THE DEPARTMENT
OF HOMELAND SECURITY JUST
ANOTHER GIANT REGULATORY
BUREAUCRACY THAT IS NOT
FUNCTIONING, OR HAVE THEY
CREATED IT IN SUCH A WAY
THAT IT CAN'T FUNCTION.
ARE THEY PAYING LIP SERVICE,
NOT THAT THE COLOR CODED
CHART IS NOT VALUABLE, I'M
NOT SAYING THAT.
>> THEY PUT MORE POLITICAL
APPOINTEES IN THE HOMELAND
SECURITY DEPARTMENT, WHICH
THEY CREATED AFTER 9/11 TO
PROTECT US.
MORE POLITICAL APPOINTEES IN
THAT DEPARTMENT THAN ANY
OTHER DEPARTMENT IN THE
GOVERNMENT AS A PERCENTAGE
OF THEIR PEOPLE.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
YEAH, THEY CREATED THIS HUGE
BUREAUCRACY.
BUT THEY DIDN'T SOLVE ANY
PROBLEMS.
>> Jon: THEIR ADMINISTRATION
WAS ABOUT CREATING A
POLITICAL MACHINE THAT COULD
CONTROL ALL THE LEVERS 9
GOVERNMENT AND SORT OF
PUSHING OUT, LET'S SAY --
THEIR IDEA WAS THE
CAREERISTS WERE THE
BUREAUCRATS WHO WOULDN'T GET
ANYTHING DONE.
LET'S GET GUYS IN THERE THAT,
YOU KNOW, WILL MARCH FOR US.
>> RIGHT.
AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO A
DOCTOR OR A LAWYER OR EVEN
AN AUTO MECHANIC, YOU WANT
TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE
TRAINED, THEY HAVE RECENTLY
BEEN RETRAINED AND
RECERTIFIED, THEY HAVE --
THE INDUSTRY HAS STANDARDS
AND PROCEDURES AND
ACCOUNTABILITY.
>> Jon: ME, I WANT TO KNOW
THEIR VIEWS ON GAY MARRIAGE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: FOR ME, IF I HAVE A
MECHANIC I SAY ARE YOU NOT
TOUCHING MY CARBURETOR AS
LONG AS I MAKE SURE THAT TWO
MEN CAN LOVE EACH OTHER,
PLEASE.
>> THAT IS WHAT THEY DID
WITH THE PEOPLE THEY SENT TO
IRAQ.
THE PEOPLE THEY SENT TO OUR
EMBASSY IN IRAQ AFTER THEIR
INVASION, THEY ASKED THEM
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON
ABORTION.
HALF THE PEOPLE THEY SENT,
HAD NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE
COUNTRY BEFORE.
THEY HAD TO APPLY FOR
PASSPORTS.
YOU WANTED THEM TO BE ABLE
TO SPEAK ARABIC, RIGHT.
THESE GUYS HADN'T EVEN BEEN
OUT OF THE COUNTRY BEFORE.
>> Jon: IS THERE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO RECLAIM THE
MANTEL OF COMPETENCE IN
GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY IN
WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.
>> THAT IS WHAT THE BOOK IS
ABOUT.
IS HOW DO YOU GET THE
GOVERNMENT TO WORK AGAIN.
AND ONE WAY IS TO TAKE THE
POLITICS OUT OF NATIONAL
SECURITY.
>> Jon: ISN'T THE CAT OUT OF
THAT BAG.
HOW DO YOU --
>> YOU GRAB THE CAT AND PUT
IT BACK IN THE BAG.
>> Jon: HAVE YOU EVER HAD A
CAT.
>> NO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU CAN BARELY GET
THEM -- [BLEEP].
>> I HEAR YOU.
>> Jon: WELL, WE'RE OUT OF
TIME BUT IT IS A REALLY NICE,
STRAIGHTFORWARD COMMON SENSE
APPROACH TO THE WHOLE THING.
SO I THINK THAT ASSURES THAT
IT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED.
>> PROBABLY NOT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BUT WE APPRECIATE
YOU COMING.
THANKS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: YOUR GOVERNMENT
FAILED YOU IS ON THE BOOK
SHELVES NOW.
