>> Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GREAT ONE, ROGER WATERS OF PINK FLOYD WILL BE GOING UP HERE.
OBVIOUSLY THE INTERVIEW WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A LASER SHOW.
LET ME JUST GET RIGHT TO IT.
IF YOU ARE HERE AND YOU DID RECENTLY GET MARRIED (LAUGHING), YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR SISTER ALONG?
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT NOW.
BEFORE WE BEGIN, ONE QUICK BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING.
LAST THURSDAY WE TOOK A BIT OF A IS A TEARIAL LOOK AT AN IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD SOLVE
SOME OF OUR FISCAL ISSUES BY EXPLOITING A LEGAL LOOPHOLE AND MINTING A TRILLION DOLLAR COIN.
I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST BUT IF WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE [BLEEP]
UP, I SAID GO HOME.
HOW ABOUT A $20 TRILLION COIN OR FORGET ABOUT IT.
I WAS DIGGING THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE COUCH CUSHIONS AND EISENHOWER MUST HAVE LEFT THIS
$100 QUILLION BILL.
I KNOW IT'S REAL BECAUSE IT HAS OUR NATION'S PREVIOUS SEAL, A UNICORN FERCHING ASON TAWR.
SAUCY.
WE DID RECEIVE A BIT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT FROM THE ONLY CREATURE PERHAPS MORE NOBLE THAN A
FRESHLY FELCHED UNICORN.
AND THE POINT IS THIS.
WE HEARD FROM THE RARE GRAY-BEARDED URBAN LAUREATE ECONOMIST PAUL KRUGMAN.
ANYWAY, HE WROTE ON HIS BLOG THERE HE CALLED ME LAZY.
SAID THERE WAS A LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM ON THE PART OF OF ME AND MY STAFF.
FOR FINDING PRIVILEGE OLITY IN THE IDEA OF A TEMPORARY TRILLION DOLLAR COIN.
FIRST OF ALL, LAZY?
I'M BANGING IT OUT 22 MINUTES A DAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DON'T TELL ME I DON'T WORK HARD.
AND SECOND OF ALL, DON'T BLAME MY IGNORANCE ON MY STAFF.
IT'S ALL ME.
YOU KNOW, THEY GOT ENOUGH TO DO WHAT WITH CARRYING ME FROM CUBICLE TO CUBICLE.
AS WE LEARNED EARLIER, I'M LAZY.
SO WHAT IS YOUR BEEF?
AND IF YOU COULD PUT IT IN WEB CAST FORM, SATURATE THE COLOR AND TILT THAT [BLEEP]
>> UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ISSUES ARE.
THE REASON WE'VE GOTTEN TO THIS PLACE HE DID IT AS A SORT OF YUK YUK YUK STUPID.
WHEN HE JUST TURNS IT INTO DUMB, OH, I DON'T KNOW NOTHING BUT THOSE PEOPLE LOOK STUPID TO ME,
HE'S ACTUALLY, HE'S RUINING HIS OWN BRAND.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IS MY BRAND.
AND SECOND OF ALL,...
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ... WHAT?
IF ANYBODY IS RUINING THEIR BRAND, WITH A TRILLION DOLLAR COIN IDEA, I DON'T THINK IT'S
THE NONECONOMIST.
LOOK.
AS WE MOST BITS WE DO, WHETHER OF THE FULLY FLESHED-OUT OR MORE DRIVE-BY VARIETY, THERE ARE
ALWAYS VARIOUS COUNTERARGUMENTS AND NUANCES OF LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT WHICH CAN BE CITED AS
EVIDENCE OF THIS SHOW'S INHERENT UNFAIRNESS OR IGNORANCE.
TYPICALLY A BLUNTNESS PEOPLE FORGIVE WHEN IN AGREEMENT WITH OUR POINT OF VIEW.
SO I STANDBY OUR RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC.
WITH DUE DILIGENCE AND MY IGNORANCE INCLUSION THAT A TRILLION DOLLAR COIN IS A STUPID
[BLEEP] IDEA.
