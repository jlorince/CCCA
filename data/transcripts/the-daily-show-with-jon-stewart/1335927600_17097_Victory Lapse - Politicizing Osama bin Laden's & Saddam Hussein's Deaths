PARTISAN.
THE GUY JUST SAID THAT.
BEFORE OUR OTHER TROUBLING ASPECTS TO THIS ANNIVERSARY.
>> ONE MIGHT EXPECT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY GREAT DAY,
GREAT JOB ON BEHALF OF THE NAVY SEALS.
>> I WOULD DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO IS GIVE CREDIT
TO OTHERS AND THOSE ON THE FRONT LINE.
>> Stewart: YES, THANK YOU.
THAT IS TROUBLE.  WHY CAN'T PRESIDENT OBAMA SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
>> GIVE THANKS FOR THE MEN WHO CARRIED OUT THIS OPERATION.
>> HANGS TO THE REMARKABLE COURAGE AND PRECISION OF OUR FORCES.
>> THANKS TO OUR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS AND SPECIAL FORCES.
>> THE PILOTS WHO LANDED THE HELICOPTER.
>> THE TROOPS, THE STEELS, WE KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Stewart: HONESTLY, I THINK HE THANKED EVERYBODY BUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN.
>> UNBELIEVABLE.
NOW, BY THE WAY, IN A CACOPHONY OF GALLING FORGETFULNESS, AKA BALD HEIMER, PA TALKIE STANDS ALONE.
>> THANK THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE.
>> HERE IS GEORGE PA TAU CAN I AND AT 2004 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
>> ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, AL QAEDA ATTACKED AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME THEY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
THERE IS ONE THING THEY DIDN'T BANK ON, THEY DIDN'T BANK ON GEORGE W. BUSH.
HE MOBILIZED OUR FORCES AND> WENT TO AFGHANISTAN.
>> GEORGE BUSH PROTECTED OUR COUNTRY AND HE PROTECTS IT STILL!
>> Stewart: BY HIMSELF!
>> BECAUSE GEORGE BUSH IS IRONMAN!
>> THAT IS A FACT!, NOW TO BE FAIR NOT EVERYBODY IS CRITICIZING OBAMA FOR THE AD,
SOME ARE CRITICIZING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE AD.
THE OBAMA TEAM NOW IS TRYING TO MAGNIFY THE POLITICAL BENEFIT OF THE RAID WITH THAT CAMPAIGN AD
SUGGESTING MITT ROMNEY MAY NOT HAVE ORDERED IT N THE ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE OF A CAMPAIGN
SUCH DISTORTIONS MAY BE COMMONPLACE, BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF TO DO IT IN
THE PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN LEADER IN THE WHITE HOUSE RINGS ONE WORD TO MIND.
YUCK.
>> Stewart: BY THE WAY IF YOU ENJOYED THAT YOU SHOULD CHECK
OUT BRIT HUME'S NEW SHOW, BRIT HUME ONE WORD REVIEWS.
GOOD.
REALLY?
>> SMURFTASTIC.
>> RRRRR.
>> I GET IT, YOU CAN'T (BLEEP) ON YOUR OPPONENT DURING AN OFFICIAL FUNCTION.
LIKE GREET AGO HEAD OF STATE.
I AM JUST CURIOUS DID YOUR CEREBRAL CORTEX NOT RECORD THIS BUSH ELECTION YEAR GEM WITH
IRAQI PRIME MINISTER ALLAWI.
>> TO THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN SITTING IN A PRISON CELL.
>> THAT STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE STATEMENT MY OPPONENT MADE YESTERDAY.
YUCK.
>> THERE IS PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
LOOK, REPUBLICANS, YEAH, THE OBAMA AD, KIND OF (BLEEP), A LITTLE OF A CHEAP SHOT, BUT THE
ONLY REASON YOU ARE PISSED IS THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO RUN IT.
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, IF BIN HAD BEEN KILLED ON BUSH'S WATCH
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE AD YOU ARE RUNNING WITH.
>> HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF OUR DARKEST DAYS, ONE OF THE MOST EVIL MEN IN HISTORY.
>> Stewart: AND I GOT HIM!  THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S ME.
GEORGE W OSAMA BIN LADEN KILLING BUSH.
>> NO, PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT.
YOU ARE GOING DOWN!  TEXAS STYLE!
>> DEATH IS A DISH BEST SERVED BARBECUE.
>> WHERE WAS KERRY?  SAILING TO PUSSY ISLAND.
>> YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH EPICOT BALLS.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS HIDING.
REAGAN TOLD ME IN A DREAM.
>> ONE FOR THE GIPPER, GEORGE.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME, AMERICA.
TAKE THAT BEARDY!  YEEEEEHAAAA!!!
>> I AM GEORGE W. BUSH AND I SURE AS HELL APPROVE
