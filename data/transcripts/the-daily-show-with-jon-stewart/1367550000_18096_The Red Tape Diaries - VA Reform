(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELL DOM-- WELCOME
TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME
IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR
YOU TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE HEAD
OF THE GROUP THE MISSION
CONTINUES.
A GREAT ORGANIZATION THAT
WORKS WITH VETERANS, ERIC
GREITENS WILL BE JOINING US
ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
AND NO, NO, I'M NOT SICK.
HOW YOU KNOW YOU ARE AGING,
AND WEAKENING WHEN YOU COME
OUT, WHEN YOU COME OUT TO
THE AUDIENCE AND THEY ALL GO,
AH.
SPEAKING OF VETERANS, AS WE
KNOW VETERANS MUST NOW WAIT
THROUGH A BACKLOG OF NEARLY
A MILLION BENEFIT CLAIMS AT
THE VA, CLAIMS SEEN HERE
DOING THEIR IMPRESSION OF
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S GARAGE.
DON'T MOVE MY BOXES, I HAVE
A SYSTEM!
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN A
PROGRESS REPORT IS YOU MAY
RECALL AS OF A COUPLE OF
MONTHS AGO THINGS LOOKED
PRETTY GRIM FOR VETERANS
AWAITSING BENEFIT, FOR NOW
WE GO TO OUR CORRESPONDENT
BRIAN WILLIAMS.
>> AFTER TWO WARS IN WHICH
THEY WERE ASKED TO SACRIFICE
SO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY,
MANY VETERANS ARE NOW
RETURNING HOME TO WAIT YEARS
FOR THE BENEFITS THEY WERE
PROMISED.
ALMOST A MILLION AMERICAN
VETERANS ARE WAITING FOR
CLAIMS.
>> Jon: THANKS, BRIAN.
SEE YOU SOON.
WELL-- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
TO PAY HIM FOR THAT, DO WE?
WELL, FOLKS, GOOD NEWS.
THE VETERAN'S AFFAIRS
DEPARTMENT IS NOW
WITHHOLDING BONUSES FOR
SENIOR OFFICIALS OVERSEEING
DISABILITY CLAIMS.
>> Jon: THEY HAVEN'T DONE
REALLY MUCH ABOUT THE
BACKLOG OF CLAIMS BUT THEY
HAVE STOPPED GIVING BONUSES
TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED
IT.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.
I MEANS THAT'S GOT TO SUCK
THOUGH, FOR THOSE GUYS NOT
GET THEIR BONUSES.
I MEAN TO HAVE THE
GOVERNMENT PROMISE YOU A
BENEFIT AND YOU KNOW, NOT
DELIVER IT, WELL-- I CAN'T
IMAGINE ANYONE ELSE EVEN
KNOWS WHAT THAT MUST FEEL
LIKE.
TO BE FAIR, THE VA IS NOT
JUST WITHHOLDING BONUSES,
THEY'RE ALSO TAKING STEPS TO
FIX THINGS.
EVENTUALLY.
>> WE ARE REVOLVED TO
ELIMINATE THE CLAIMS BACKLOG
OF 2015, NOT JUST REDUCE IT,
END IT.
WHEN CLAIMS WILL BE
PROCESSED AT 125 DAYS OR
LESS.
>> Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT,
IN ONLY TWO MORE YEARS,
THEY'RE HOPING TO HAVE YOU
WAIT ONLY FOUR MORE MONTHS.
HOW WILL THEY DO IT?
WELL, THEY HAVEN'T FULLY
COMPUTERIZED THEIR RECORDS
BUT THEY HAVE COMPUTERIZED
THEIR PLAN TO COMPUTERIZE
THEIR RECORD IN THE FORM OF
THIS POWER POINT
PRESENTATION ABOUT THE
BACKLOG OF CLAIMS, INCLUDING
THIS SOMEWHAT ALARMING SLIDE
READING THE ENEMY IS PAPER.
SEE, THAT'S WHAT IS
HAPPENING?
DON'T YOU PEOPLE GET IT?
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: DON'T YOU SEE WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS?
PAPER HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS
AN ENEMY COMBATANT.
(LAUGHTER)
THEREFORE THESE RECORDS CAN
NOW BE HELD FOR INDEFINITE
PERIODS IN A KIND OF
BUREAUCRATIC BLACK SITE
LIMBO.
A KIND OF PAPER GITMO.
(LAUGHTER)
WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE
LEAST POPULAR PAPER DOLL
BOOK EVER.
(LAUGHTER)
AT THIS POINT-- YES, YOU CAN
GET THAT AT YOUR
