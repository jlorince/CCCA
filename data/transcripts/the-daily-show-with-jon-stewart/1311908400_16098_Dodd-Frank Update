FEATURE EXTRA EVER.
NOW WITH THE STANDOFF IN OUR
NATION'S CAPITOL OVER THE
DEBT CEILING SHOWING US
NOTHING BUT BITTER STALEMATE,
IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT IT
WAS JUST ONE YEAR AGO THAT
WASHINGTON ACTUALLY GOT
SOMETHING DONE, THE DODD
FRANK ACT, A COMPLETE
OVERHAUL OF THE REGULATIONS
GOVERNING OUR FINANCIAL
SYSTEM INTENDED TO ENSURE
THAT WE WOULD NEVER AGAIN
SUFFER ANOTHER 2008-STYLE
MELTDOWN.
>> THESE REFORMS REPRESENT
THE STRONGEST CONSUMER
FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS IN
HISTORY.
AND THESE PROTECTIONS WILL
BE ENFORCED BY A NEW
CONSUMER WATCHDOG WITH JUST
ONE JOB, LOOKING OUT FOR
PEOPLE, NOT BIG BANKS, NOT
LENDERS, NOT INVESTMENT
HOUSES, LOOKING OUT FOR
PEOPLE-- .
>> Jon: WHAT, WAIT, WHO?
WHO ARE WE LOOKING OUT FOR
BEFORE?
(LAUGHTER)
ANYWAY, THE DODD FRANK ACT
IS NOW ONE YEAR OLD.
AND HERE TO DISCUSS THE
EFFECT IT'S HAVING IN
REFORMING A DAMAGED
FINANCIAL SYSTEM, WE'RE VERY
LUCKY TO HAVE WITH US
TONIGHT, HR 4127-- 4173.
THE DODD FRANK ACT,
EVERYBODY.

BLAMING LOBBYISTS IS A COP
OUT, JON.
HERE IS WHAT IS GOING DOWN.
THIS WHOLE FINANCIAL REFORM
THING IS A SHAM!
THE ONLY WAY CONGRESS WOULD
PASS ME IS IF THE DETAILS IN
MY RULES AND REGULATIONS
WERE LEFT UNSPECIFIED GIVING
LOBBYISTS ALL THE TIME THEY
WOULD NEED TO WATER ME DOWN
POST PASSAGE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, EXACTLY,
BOO, EXACTLY.

>> THANK YOU, BOYS AND GIRLS,
THANK YOU.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT, IF ANY
ACTUAL TOUGH RULE MANAGED TO
SQUEEZE THROUGH, CONGRESS
PEOPLE CUT THE BUDGET OF THE
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR
ENFORCING IT.
THE WHOLE THING IS A GIANT
PUNT.
I'M NO LAW.
I'M NO LAW, JON.
I'M JUST AN UNDEFINED,
IMPOTENT 20-- 2,300 PIECE OF
LEGISLATIVE [BLEEP].
YOU SEE THIS?
