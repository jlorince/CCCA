YOU KNOW, WE ALL WANT OURCHILDREN TO BE SAFE FROM ANY
INFRINGEMENT ON THEIR SECONDAMENDMENT RIGHTS.
LUCKILY LAWMAKERS IN ONESTATE SHARE THAT CONCERN AS
JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
>> DOCTORS, ALL DAY LONGWITH THE DOCTOR TALK.
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?
ARE YOU EXERCISING?
YADDA YADDA YADDA.
FINALLY FLORIDA IS GETTINGTHEM TO SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP
ABOUT ONE SO-CALLED HEALTHHAZARD.
>> GOVERNOR RICK SCOTTSIGNED LEGISLATION THAT
PROHIBITS DOCTORS FROMASKING THEIR PATIENTS IF
THEY OWN GUNS.
>> SECOND AMENDMENT ATTORNEYAND GUN AFFICIONADO NOEL
FLASTERSTEIN EXPLAINS WHY ITIS IMPORTANT TO KEEP DOCTORS
IN CHECK.
>> I DON'T NEED A DOCTORASKING ME ABOUT WHETHER I
OWN FIREARMS OR NOT.
THEY GIVE MISINFORMATION,THEY SAY CHILDREN ARE HARMED,
GUNS ARE DANGER.
YOU CAN ONLY COME TO ONECONCLUSION --
>> THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THEHEALTH AND SAFETY OF A CHILD.
>> NO.
THEY'RE AGAINST OUR SECONDAMENDMENT.
RIGHT.
>> SO THIS LAW WAS ENACTEDTO STOP PHYSICIANS FROM
HARASSING PATIENTS ANDDISCOURAGING GUN OWNERSHIP.
PEDIATRICIAN AND BUZZKILLDR. RICHARDS- ROWLEY.
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU CAN'THAVE A GUN.
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALKTO PARENTS ABOUT SAFETY IN
GENERAL.
AND GUN SAFETY IS PART OFKEEPING KIDS SAFE.
>> NAME ONE SCENARIO WHEREYOU WOULD EVER HAVE TO TALK
TO A PATIENT ABOUT GUNS.
>> A SUICIDAL PATIENT.
A TODDLER WHO HAS A PARENTWHO HAS A LOADED GUN IN THE
HOUSE.
A GRANDFATHER WHO WANTS TOTAKE THEIR CHILD OUT
HUNTING.
>> I SAID NAME ONE.
>> SO MAYBE THERE ARE A FEWHYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS WHERE
GUNS MAY POSE A THREAT TOCHILDREN.
BUT THE REALITY IS QUITEDIFFERENT.
>> PEOPLE WILL GO AND SCREAM ANDCRY THAT OH, CHILDREN, GUNS
HURT CHILDREN.
WELL, YES, IN 2012, OVER3,000 CHILDREN AGES, I
BELIEVE 14 TO 25 WERE KILLEDBY FIREARM HOMICIDES.
>> THAT'S NOT THAT MANY.
>> COMPARED TO AUTOMOBILES,NO, IT'S NOT.
>> THAT'S SMALL, COMPARED TOAUTOMOBILES,
THAT'S LIKE ALMOSTINSIGNIFICANT.
>> I WOULD AGREE.
>> EXCEPT FOR THE FAMILIES OFTHOSE CHILDREN.
>> WELL, OF COURSE.
BUT CHILDREN HAVE ALSO BEENKILLED IN MANY, MANY MORE
TRAGEDIES LIKE DROWNING INPOOLS.
THESE ARE GREATER DANGERS TOOUR CHILDREN THAN FIREARMS
IN THE HOUSE AND GUNS.
>> THEN WHY AREN'T DOCTORSTALKING ABOUT THESE OTHER
DANGERS.
THERE COULD ONLY BE ONEEXPLANATION.
>> YOU'RE ANTI-GUN.
>> I'M NOT ANTI-GUN.
>> WELL IF THAT IS THE CASE, DOTALK ABOUT IF THEY HAVE A
POOL AT HOME.
>> YES.
>> SO ARE YOU ANTI-POOL ASWELL.
>> WE TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.
WHETHER IT'S GUN SAFETY,WHETHER IT'S POOL SAFETY.
>> NOW THEY'RE COMING AFTEROUR POOLS?
THE POOL INDUSTRY MUST BEPISSED.
I SAT DOWN WITH A POOLSPECIALIST TO HEAR JUST HOW
ANGRY THEY ARE.
>> WE WOULD NEVER DISCOURAGEPEDIATRICIANS TALKING TO
PARENTS ABOUT POOL SAFETY.
>> WHAT?
>> I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT AFRAID THEGOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TAKE
AWAY YOUR RIGHTS?
>> NO.
WHY WOULD THEY-- ANYONE WHOIS-- SAFETY IS OUR PRIORITY
SO ANYONE WHO TALKS ABOUTSAFETY IS OKAY WITH US.
>> I GUESS THE POOL GUYSJUST DON'T GET IT BUT GUN
OWNERS HAVE EVEN MORE TOWORRY ABOUT.
>> IF A DOCTOR IS KEEPING ALIST OF HIS PATIENTS WHO
HAVE FIREARMS, THE GREATFEAR IS THAT IF THEY START
COLLECTING THIS DATA, ITLEADS TO DICTATORS, TYRANTS,
HITLER.
>> HOLOCAUST 2.
>> HOLOCAUST W -- EXACTLY.
>> IT WAS ALL STARTING TOMAKE SENSE.
>> WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUTTHE HOLOCAUST.
>> YET.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUTSAFETY.
>> WHAT I HEAR IS THAT YOUARE ANTI-SEMI AUTOMATIC.
YOU ARE GOING TO PUT MY NAMEON THE LIST.
>> THERE IS NO LIST.
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMINGTO TAKE YOUR GUNS.
>> SINCE GUN INJURIES AREGOING AREN'T GOING AWAY, HOW
CAN DOCTORS GET AROUND THISGAG ORDER ON GUN TALK?
>> ALL RIGHT CLASS, I HAVE ASHARP PAIN IN MY SIDE,
COULD IT BE FROMSOMETHING THAT I ATE?
>> YES.
>> GUNSHOT WOUND.
>> CAN'T SAY THE G WORD, ALLRIGHT.
LET'S START, TRY SOMETHINGLIKE, LEAD POISONING.
HOW I DID GET LEAD POISONING?
>> FROM A BULLET.
>> NOPE, YOU CAN'T SAY BULLETEITHER.
>> MAYBE IT'S A SECONDAMENDMENT HERITAGE SITE.
>> I STILL THINK IT'S AGUNSHOT WOUND.
>> STOP IT. IT DOESN'T MATTERWHAT YOU THINK.
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER ONEVERY IMPORTANT RULE.
>> DON'T TALK ABOUT GUNS.
>> YOU GUYS ARE GOING TOMAKE ME CRY.
>> MAYBE IT IS A GUNSHOTWOUND.
>> OKAY, WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
>> BUT EVEN FLASTERSTEINCONCEDES IT IS ONE SITUATION
WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE FORDOCTORS TO TALK TO PATIENTS
ABOUT GUNS IN THE HOME.
>> IF I'M SHOWING SIGNS OFMENTAL ILLNESS, THAT IS A
DIFFERENT STORY.
WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF MENTALILLNESS?
IRRATIONAL FEAR OFNAZIS?
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOUCOULD DESCRIBE A FEAR OF NAZIS
AS BEING IRRATIONAL.
>> MAYBE PARANOIA ABOUT BEINGON THE GOVERNMENT'S LIST.
>> WELL, THAT'S-- THAT'S-- IDON'T-- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
PARANOIA.
>> INABILITY TO RECOGNIZEWHEN SOMEONE'S [BLEEP] WITH
YOU?
>> WHAT?
>> DIAGNOSING MENTAL ILLNESSISN'T EASY.
BUT AT LEAST IT'S STILLSOMETHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT
WITH OUR DOCTORS.
>> FOR NOW.
